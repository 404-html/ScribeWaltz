<v Speaker 2>of the Federal Emergency Management </v>

4
00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:21.890
<v Speaker 2>Agency,</v>

<v Speaker 2>as well as the host of the Michael Brown</v>
<v Speaker 2>radio show.</v>

6
00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:27.470
<v Speaker 2>Michael Brown.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Welcome to the Rubin report.</v>

7
00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:28.670
<v Speaker 2>Hey Dave.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Good to see you.</v>

8
00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:30.890
<v Speaker 2>Good to be with the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

9
00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:34.150
<v Speaker 2>this is the first time we've ever done </v>
<v Speaker 2>this where we played a ten second clip.</v>

10
00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:37.990
<v Speaker 2>Let me get.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you have any idea where I can.</v>

11
00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:39.980
<v Speaker 2>I can't even imagine what you might be </v>
<v Speaker 2>talking about.</v>

12
00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:40.903
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I struggled with it for a little while </v>

13
00:00:43.101 --> 00:00:43.934
<v Speaker 2>because I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do I want to go right in and throw this </v>

14
00:00:45.831 --> 00:00:46.664
<v Speaker 2>right at him?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sort of the infamous moment or do we </v>

15
00:00:48.741 --> 00:00:50.270
<v Speaker 2>want to ease into it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but then I thought,</v>

16
00:00:50.271 --> 00:00:51.104
<v Speaker 2>let's just.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's just get it out there because it </v>

17
00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:57.440
<v Speaker 2>is what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a seminal moment in my life.</v>

18
00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:59.450
<v Speaker 2>It the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's,</v>

19
00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:01.700
<v Speaker 2>there's before that moment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then after that moment.</v>

20
00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:02.803
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Alright.</v>

21
00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:05.270
<v Speaker 2>There are many,</v>
<v Speaker 2>many reasons that I'm glad to be sitting</v>

22
00:01:05.271 --> 00:01:06.104
<v Speaker 2>here with you because I think we're </v>
<v Speaker 2>going to get into so many of the things </v>

23
00:01:08.391 --> 00:01:09.224
<v Speaker 2>that we talked about on the show all the</v>
<v Speaker 2>time about the role of government and </v>

24
00:01:11.451 --> 00:01:14.330
<v Speaker 2>the difference between local government </v>
<v Speaker 2>and federal government,</v>

25
00:01:14.331 --> 00:01:17.060
<v Speaker 2>all of these agencies and red tape and </v>
<v Speaker 2>all that,</v>

26
00:01:17.061 --> 00:01:17.894
<v Speaker 2>but also that for that moment and what </v>
<v Speaker 2>happened for the months and probably </v>

27
00:01:21.771 --> 00:01:25.400
<v Speaker 2>years after that and actually even I </v>
<v Speaker 2>when I was googling you this morning,</v>

28
00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:26.293
<v Speaker 2>all the 10 year anniversary people that </v>
<v Speaker 2>were still pissed at you and all that </v>

29
00:01:28.761 --> 00:01:31.550
<v Speaker 2>stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It has a lot to do with your sort of the</v>

30
00:01:31.551 --> 00:01:34.910
<v Speaker 2>general outrage culture and blame </v>
<v Speaker 2>culture and all of that.</v>

31
00:01:34.911 --> 00:01:35.744
<v Speaker 2>So we're going to do a lot here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So first let's just start with that </v>

32
00:01:38.211 --> 00:01:40.600
<v Speaker 2>moment though and then and then I want </v>
<v Speaker 2>to do everything else back.</v>

33
00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:42.170
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

34
00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:46.940
<v Speaker 2>Just tell me a little bit about the days</v>
<v Speaker 2>leading up to Hurricane Katrina.</v>

35
00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:53.270
<v Speaker 2>It became clear to me probably within.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

36
00:01:53.271 --> 00:01:54.104
<v Speaker 2>it came clear to me the day after the </v>
<v Speaker 2>storm made landfall because I was on a </v>

37
00:01:57.621 --> 00:02:01.220
<v Speaker 2>Black Hawk helicopter with former </v>
<v Speaker 2>senator Mary Landrieu,</v>

38
00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:02.593
<v Speaker 2>and we were supposed to be going </v>
<v Speaker 2>straight to the superdome to meet with </v>

39
00:02:04.971 --> 00:02:05.804
<v Speaker 2>Mayor Nagin,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who I always like to joke is remind </v>

40
00:02:07.641 --> 00:02:11.790
<v Speaker 2>people he's still in federal prison and </v>
<v Speaker 2>in I'm sitting there and I'm not.</v>

41
00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:12.703
<v Speaker 2>I'm just kind of reading my notes from </v>
<v Speaker 2>my staff and I look out the helicopter </v>

42
00:02:15.781 --> 00:02:16.614
<v Speaker 2>and I realized that we're going the </v>
<v Speaker 2>wrong direction across lake </v>

43
00:02:19.131 --> 00:02:23.630
<v Speaker 2>pontchartrain and I asked the pilot,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where were you going?</v>

44
00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:24.751
<v Speaker 2>And he said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

45
00:02:24.751 --> 00:02:29.751
<v Speaker 2>the senator has asked that we go check </v>
<v Speaker 2>her cabin before we go to the superdome.</v>

46
00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:32.203
<v Speaker 2>I was livid,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so now I have a sitting United States </v>

47
00:02:34.401 --> 00:02:38.630
<v Speaker 2>senator next to me who's just overridden</v>
<v Speaker 2>what I said we need to be doing and what</v>

48
00:02:38.631 --> 00:02:39.680
<v Speaker 2>the priorities are.</v>

49
00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:40.783
<v Speaker 2>I have the governor sitting next to her </v>
<v Speaker 2>who doesn't have the wherewithal to say </v>

50
00:02:43.971 --> 00:02:45.530
<v Speaker 2>to the senator,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know what?</v>

51
00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:46.393
<v Speaker 2>Your cabin is not our priority.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The priority is the people of New </v>

52
00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:50.293
<v Speaker 2>Orleans.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was a moment that I realized that I </v>

53
00:02:52.491 --> 00:02:56.000
<v Speaker 2>had walked into a state that was so much</v>
<v Speaker 2>more corrupt.</v>

54
00:02:56.001 --> 00:02:56.834
<v Speaker 2>I've been involved in politics and so I </v>
<v Speaker 2>was literally six years old that was </v>

55
00:02:59.231 --> 00:03:00.064
<v Speaker 2>just so corrupt and it was so </v>
<v Speaker 2>dysfunctional that I knew that </v>

56
00:03:03.011 --> 00:03:07.300
<v Speaker 2>everything that I had in my head about </v>
<v Speaker 2>how things should operate,</v>

57
00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:09.010
<v Speaker 2>we're going to start going out the </v>
<v Speaker 2>window.</v>

58
00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:10.203
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that's actually a perfect story </v>

59
00:03:11.351 --> 00:03:15.190
<v Speaker 2>to now start with your childhood.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's just,</v>

60
00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:18.100
<v Speaker 2>let's just get a little bias because I </v>
<v Speaker 2>think that's really interesting and what</v>

61
00:03:18.101 --> 00:03:18.934
<v Speaker 2>led you to eventually be the director of</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fema and then we'll go through </v>

62
00:03:21.641 --> 00:03:22.474
<v Speaker 2>everything else.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So just tell me a little bit about </v>

63
00:03:23.741 --> 00:03:24.220
<v Speaker 2>growing up.</v>

64
00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:25.053
<v Speaker 2>Was Your family political?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What sort of got you into this world </v>

65
00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:27.851
<v Speaker 2>like?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

66
00:03:27.851 --> 00:03:29.860
<v Speaker 2>My family was kind of political.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When I think about it.</v>

67
00:03:29.861 --> 00:03:33.850
<v Speaker 2>I mean my mom is 86,</v>
<v Speaker 2>87 years old and she still works for the</v>

68
00:03:33.851 --> 00:03:34.684
<v Speaker 2>election board.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She still does the little local </v>

69
00:03:36.551 --> 00:03:38.340
<v Speaker 2>elections in the little town that I grew</v>
<v Speaker 2>up in.</v>

70
00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:40.520
<v Speaker 2>I think you'd have to be over 80 to work</v>
<v Speaker 2>at the electrical.</v>

71
00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:42.280
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it is a requirement,</v>

72
00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:43.870
<v Speaker 2>she's been doing this since she was in </v>
<v Speaker 2>high school,</v>

73
00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:48.490
<v Speaker 2>but when the first Republican governor </v>
<v Speaker 2>of Oklahoma was running,</v>

74
00:03:48.491 --> 00:03:52.030
<v Speaker 2>he was state party chairman,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a guy by the name of Henry Belding,</v>

75
00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:54.430
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>was coming out to the Oklahoma panhandle</v>

76
00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:55.623
<v Speaker 2>and they recruited me at six years old </v>
<v Speaker 2>to be the little kid to him the push </v>

77
00:03:59.071 --> 00:04:01.780
<v Speaker 2>cards out as he walked these rural </v>
<v Speaker 2>streets of Oklahoma.</v>

78
00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:03.003
<v Speaker 2>So I just grew up in this political </v>
<v Speaker 2>family that was always involved and of </v>

79
00:04:07.571 --> 00:04:07.851
<v Speaker 2>course,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

80
00:04:07.851 --> 00:04:09.370
<v Speaker 2>involved in student council and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

81
00:04:09.371 --> 00:04:11.350
<v Speaker 2>in college and Young Republicans know </v>
<v Speaker 2>all of that.</v>

82
00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:12.483
<v Speaker 2>And so politics has just always been a </v>
<v Speaker 2>part of my life and I always thought I </v>

83
00:04:16.061 --> 00:04:21.061
<v Speaker 2>understood politics until I got to </v>
<v Speaker 2>Washington DC until Hurricane Katrina.</v>

84
00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:24.850
<v Speaker 2>And it just gave me an entirely </v>
<v Speaker 2>different perspective.</v>

85
00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:26.920
<v Speaker 2>But anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 2>long story short,</v>

86
00:04:26.921 --> 00:04:28.270
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I took the typical route,</v>

87
00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:29.950
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>graduated from high school to my,</v>

88
00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:32.650
<v Speaker 2>my,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my wife is my childhood sweetheart.</v>

89
00:04:32.651 --> 00:04:34.430
<v Speaker 2>Her Dad actually delivered me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

90
00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:36.220
<v Speaker 2>That's the kind of small town we grew up</v>
<v Speaker 2>in.</v>

91
00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:36.940
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

92
00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:38.350
<v Speaker 2>we've been married for,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Gosh,</v>

93
00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:40.870
<v Speaker 2>40 some years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to say how many,</v>

94
00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:42.310
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

95
00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:44.000
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

96
00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:46.060
<v Speaker 2>went to law school,</v>
<v Speaker 2>raised two children,</v>

97
00:04:46.061 --> 00:04:47.860
<v Speaker 2>very successful,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very,</v>

98
00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:51.820
<v Speaker 2>very successful children,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and just had a pretty normal life except</v>

99
00:04:51.821 --> 00:04:52.654
<v Speaker 2>that I knew I wanted to be a lawyer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I always had this thought process </v>

100
00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:02.350
<v Speaker 2>that you never turned down an aisle,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you always looking at an opportunity and</v>

101
00:05:02.351 --> 00:05:03.184
<v Speaker 2>if an opportunity looks good,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you take that opportunity even if it's </v>

102
00:05:06.671 --> 00:05:08.620
<v Speaker 2>off the path you thought you were going </v>
<v Speaker 2>to take.</v>

103
00:05:08.980 --> 00:05:11.650
<v Speaker 2>And so that's led me to these </v>
<v Speaker 2>incredible,</v>

104
00:05:11.950 --> 00:05:16.000
<v Speaker 2>incredible experiences in my life that </v>
<v Speaker 2>most people don't do because they become</v>

105
00:05:16.001 --> 00:05:18.700
<v Speaker 2>lawyers and all they do is practice law </v>
<v Speaker 2>their entire life.</v>

106
00:05:18.830 --> 00:05:19.663
<v Speaker 2>That's not me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what was the first one of those </v>

107
00:05:21.611 --> 00:05:22.720
<v Speaker 2>moments when you thought,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>

108
00:05:22.721 --> 00:05:23.554
<v Speaker 2>there's a good opportunity?</v>
<v Speaker 2>A little little to the right off that </v>

109
00:05:26.021 --> 00:05:28.840
<v Speaker 2>exit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm the alum Republican Party,</v>

110
00:05:28.841 --> 00:05:31.630
<v Speaker 2>came to me and asked me to run for </v>
<v Speaker 2>Congress back in 1988,</v>

111
00:05:31.990 --> 00:05:34.000
<v Speaker 2>promised me all of this money that they </v>
<v Speaker 2>were going to.</v>

112
00:05:34.001 --> 00:05:35.320
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that governor,</v>

113
00:05:35.321 --> 00:05:38.860
<v Speaker 2>who was the first Republican governor,</v>
<v Speaker 2>went on to be a US senator and then came</v>

114
00:05:38.861 --> 00:05:40.870
<v Speaker 2>back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was a big supporter of me,</v>

115
00:05:40.871 --> 00:05:44.140
<v Speaker 2>but I was running can rebuild them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>former US senator.</v>

116
00:05:44.141 --> 00:05:46.870
<v Speaker 2>He was involved in the Panama Canal </v>
<v Speaker 2>treaties and everything,</v>

117
00:05:46.871 --> 00:05:47.920
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

118
00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:50.890
<v Speaker 2>the Oakland Republican Party recruited </v>
<v Speaker 2>me and said,</v>

119
00:05:51.130 --> 00:05:52.360
<v Speaker 2>come on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we really want you to run,</v>

120
00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:55.930
<v Speaker 2>and so I let ego get in the way.</v>

121
00:05:55.990 --> 00:05:56.823
<v Speaker 2>And I ran against a 12 term Democrat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>incumbent in a gerrymandered district </v>

122
00:06:01.820 --> 00:06:04.610
<v Speaker 2>where I got my butt beat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it was,</v>

123
00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:07.760
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was an experience that again,</v>

124
00:06:08.330 --> 00:06:09.163
<v Speaker 2>most Americans never do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Most Americans never throw their hat in </v>

125
00:06:12.591 --> 00:06:15.560
<v Speaker 2>the ring and actually go out and say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to do it.</v>

126
00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:19.670
<v Speaker 2>And I would encourage people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whether it's a city council,</v>

127
00:06:19.700 --> 00:06:21.980
<v Speaker 2>county commissioner,</v>
<v Speaker 2>state representative,</v>

128
00:06:21.981 --> 00:06:22.814
<v Speaker 2>whatever it is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you don't like the way things are </v>

129
00:06:24.111 --> 00:06:25.800
<v Speaker 2>going,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're going to bitch about it,</v>

130
00:06:25.801 --> 00:06:26.634
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to hear about it unless </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're actually involved doing </v>

131
00:06:28.221 --> 00:06:30.770
<v Speaker 2>something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Doesn't mean you have to run for office,</v>

132
00:06:30.860 --> 00:06:31.820
<v Speaker 2>but you gotta be involved.</v>

133
00:06:31.930 --> 00:06:32.763
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's so funny after the ringer that </v>

134
00:06:33.791 --> 00:06:36.280
<v Speaker 3>you've been through,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I guess it's that maybe it's not funny.</v>

135
00:06:36.281 --> 00:06:37.114
<v Speaker 3>It's either ironic or perfectly politik </v>
<v Speaker 3>that that's still is your message as </v>

136
00:06:40.121 --> 00:06:40.954
<v Speaker 3>someone that you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we sort of put up as as the poster boy </v>

137
00:06:43.691 --> 00:06:46.300
<v Speaker 3>for everything that's wrong with Dave.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let me tell you,</v>

138
00:06:46.970 --> 00:06:48.610
<v Speaker 3>it may be poetic,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it.</v>

139
00:06:48.640 --> 00:06:50.910
<v Speaker 3>Sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I should quit pointing to the lawyer.</v>

140
00:06:50.920 --> 00:06:53.200
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it is.</v>

141
00:06:54.160 --> 00:06:58.480
<v Speaker 2>I can tell you so many stories about how</v>
<v Speaker 2>dysfunctional state I've been involved.</v>

142
00:06:58.481 --> 00:07:00.430
<v Speaker 2>I was a city councilman,</v>
<v Speaker 2>A.</v>

143
00:07:00.431 --> 00:07:03.040
<v Speaker 2>I've worked with state legislature as </v>
<v Speaker 2>the finance director.</v>

144
00:07:03.600 --> 00:07:04.433
<v Speaker 2>Then you go on A.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm the Under Secretary of Homeland </v>

145
00:07:06.160 --> 00:07:06.993
<v Speaker 2>Security.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have seen,</v>

146
00:07:07.120 --> 00:07:07.953
<v Speaker 2>I have been inside the bowels of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>government and I can tell you how it </v>

147
00:07:10.781 --> 00:07:12.880
<v Speaker 2>works and it is not what most American</v>

148
00:07:12.900 --> 00:07:15.360
<v Speaker 3>instinct and we're going to get to all </v>
<v Speaker 3>of that.</v>

149
00:07:15.361 --> 00:07:17.010
<v Speaker 3>So the Under Secretary of Homeland </v>
<v Speaker 3>Security,</v>

150
00:07:17.011 --> 00:07:18.740
<v Speaker 3>that is the director of Fema,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

151
00:07:18.750 --> 00:07:19.583
<v Speaker 3>That's the.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's just sort of the more technical </v>

152
00:07:21.031 --> 00:07:21.864
<v Speaker 3>term for that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Were you involved in the administration </v>

153
00:07:23.341 --> 00:07:25.590
<v Speaker 3>before nine slash 11 or was it after </v>
<v Speaker 3>that?</v>

154
00:07:25.591 --> 00:07:27.840
<v Speaker 3>That's when Bush know Peggy for those.</v>

155
00:07:28.420 --> 00:07:29.600
<v Speaker 2>I was there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

156
00:07:29.601 --> 00:07:30.434
<v Speaker 2>and in fact I was in Montana getting </v>
<v Speaker 2>ready to deliver a speech to the </v>

157
00:07:33.281 --> 00:07:34.114
<v Speaker 2>national emergency managers association </v>
<v Speaker 2>about the role of Fema and terrorism on </v>

158
00:07:38.201 --> 00:07:39.790
<v Speaker 2>nine slash 11,</v>
<v Speaker 2>2011.</v>

159
00:07:40.030 --> 00:07:41.680
<v Speaker 2>So you were the director of him at that </v>
<v Speaker 2>time?</v>

160
00:07:41.700 --> 00:07:42.533
<v Speaker 2>I was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was the general counsel at that time </v>

161
00:07:44.170 --> 00:07:48.490
<v Speaker 2>and we ended up on a c 1:35</v>
<v Speaker 2>going back to Andrews Air Force Base.</v>

162
00:07:48.760 --> 00:07:49.770
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Joe Wall Ball,</v>

163
00:07:49.780 --> 00:07:51.850
<v Speaker 2>who was the director at the time?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

164
00:07:51.890 --> 00:07:52.723
<v Speaker 2>immediate went,</v>
<v Speaker 2>went to ground zero on that Wednesday </v>

165
00:07:55.720 --> 00:07:58.900
<v Speaker 2>morning and I went to the White House </v>
<v Speaker 2>and just spend the next,</v>

166
00:07:59.470 --> 00:08:00.660
<v Speaker 2>gosh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>seems like year,</v>

167
00:08:00.670 --> 00:08:03.160
<v Speaker 2>just day in and day out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just planning,</v>

168
00:08:03.460 --> 00:08:05.320
<v Speaker 2>getting ready for we didn't know what.</v>

169
00:08:05.630 --> 00:08:06.463
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What's the one thing that really sticks </v>

170
00:08:08.511 --> 00:08:11.060
<v Speaker 3>out in your mind about that day itself?</v>

171
00:08:13.230 --> 00:08:18.060
<v Speaker 2>For the first time you are flying alone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There are no planes in the sky.</v>

172
00:08:18.480 --> 00:08:19.313
<v Speaker 2>You're flying alone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some airman asked me if I went to go </v>

173
00:08:21.091 --> 00:08:21.924
<v Speaker 2>down in the tanker bay and and just </v>
<v Speaker 2>watch as we fly across Middle America </v>

174
00:08:26.220 --> 00:08:27.053
<v Speaker 2>and I'm listening on the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>on the headset and the chatter you hear </v>

175
00:08:31.740 --> 00:08:32.573
<v Speaker 2>are among the fighter jets that are </v>
<v Speaker 2>flying around the country and when I </v>

176
00:08:35.791 --> 00:08:40.791
<v Speaker 2>landed it was not knowing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was like there was this blank wall in</v>

177
00:08:42.721 --> 00:08:45.180
<v Speaker 2>front of us.</v>
<v Speaker 2>None of us knew what was going to happen</v>

178
00:08:45.181 --> 00:08:46.014
<v Speaker 2>next and so we meet in the Roosevelt </v>
<v Speaker 2>Room in the situation room that next </v>

179
00:08:51.211 --> 00:08:56.211
<v Speaker 2>morning to get briefing by the CIA and </v>
<v Speaker 2>everybody else and I remember just this,</v>

180
00:08:57.840 --> 00:09:02.840
<v Speaker 2>this quietness in the room that </v>
<v Speaker 2>everybody knew that none of us knew what</v>

181
00:09:04.921 --> 00:09:06.370
<v Speaker 2>we were facing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

182
00:09:06.660 --> 00:09:07.493
<v Speaker 2>Was there a feeling that George W dot </v>
<v Speaker 2>Bush was the right guy to handle this </v>

183
00:09:10.591 --> 00:09:11.424
<v Speaker 2>because for all the frustrations that </v>
<v Speaker 2>people may have with him and that </v>

184
00:09:14.071 --> 00:09:16.740
<v Speaker 2>perhaps you have related to some degree </v>
<v Speaker 2>with Katrina and we can get into that.</v>

185
00:09:16.750 --> 00:09:18.840
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I do remember at the time,</v>

186
00:09:18.900 --> 00:09:20.520
<v Speaker 2>and I lived in New York City at the </v>
<v Speaker 2>time,</v>

187
00:09:20.521 --> 00:09:21.730
<v Speaker 2>so I was there for nine slash 11.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

188
00:09:21.770 --> 00:09:22.980
<v Speaker 2>Family was there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My grandma was there,</v>

189
00:09:22.981 --> 00:09:24.060
<v Speaker 2>my,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my dad,</v>

190
00:09:24.390 --> 00:09:27.810
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I do remember that between George w Bush</v>

191
00:09:27.811 --> 00:09:29.580
<v Speaker 2>at the time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but particularly Giuliani,</v>

192
00:09:30.150 --> 00:09:30.983
<v Speaker 2>I think there was at least a feeling </v>
<v Speaker 2>that these guys are sort of the right </v>

193
00:09:33.451 --> 00:09:36.330
<v Speaker 2>people to be handling this at the time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Certainly Giuliani,</v>

194
00:09:36.331 --> 00:09:38.190
<v Speaker 2>at least from a New Yorker's </v>
<v Speaker 2>perspective.</v>

195
00:09:38.191 --> 00:09:39.540
<v Speaker 2>Did you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>did you feel that,</v>

196
00:09:39.541 --> 00:09:41.300
<v Speaker 2>did people feel that within the </v>
<v Speaker 2>government that,</v>

197
00:09:41.310 --> 00:09:42.143
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that Bush was kind of able to handle </v>

198
00:09:43.651 --> 00:09:45.250
<v Speaker 2>this or have the right skillset to </v>
<v Speaker 2>handle this?</v>

199
00:09:45.251 --> 00:09:48.450
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was for me it was more than most.</v>

200
00:09:48.480 --> 00:09:50.160
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

201
00:09:50.161 --> 00:09:55.161
<v Speaker 2>I can still remember vividly that in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>Roosevelt Room you've got Colin Powell,</v>

202
00:09:55.591 --> 00:10:00.150
<v Speaker 2>you got Donald Rumsfeld,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Condi Rice shouldn't have andy card,</v>

203
00:10:00.360 --> 00:10:01.980
<v Speaker 2>so you have all these heavy hitters.</v>

204
00:10:02.190 --> 00:10:04.290
<v Speaker 2>And then here's little old me sitting at</v>
<v Speaker 2>the table too.</v>

205
00:10:04.560 --> 00:10:07.200
<v Speaker 2>And I remember watching because I just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm an,</v>

206
00:10:07.320 --> 00:10:08.153
<v Speaker 2>I'm an observer of people and I remember</v>
<v Speaker 2>watching all of them and there was none </v>

207
00:10:12.601 --> 00:10:13.434
<v Speaker 2>of the usual because I had been in these</v>
<v Speaker 2>meetings before and there was none of </v>

208
00:10:15.181 --> 00:10:16.140
<v Speaker 2>the usual,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

209
00:10:16.141 --> 00:10:18.090
<v Speaker 2>how you do?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And everybody was at the table.</v>

210
00:10:18.091 --> 00:10:20.610
<v Speaker 2>Everybody was reading their briefing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everybody was trying to understand.</v>

211
00:10:20.940 --> 00:10:24.480
<v Speaker 2>We know that we always referred to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>president as the boss.</v>

212
00:10:24.810 --> 00:10:25.643
<v Speaker 2>We know the boss is going to ask some </v>
<v Speaker 2>tough questions and we know we're not </v>

213
00:10:28.291 --> 00:10:30.900
<v Speaker 2>going to have answers and that's indeed </v>
<v Speaker 2>what happened.</v>

214
00:10:31.220 --> 00:10:33.390
<v Speaker 2>Know we had theories,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we have ideas,</v>

215
00:10:33.391 --> 00:10:34.224
<v Speaker 2>we have plans,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but nobody really knew for certain what </v>

216
00:10:36.811 --> 00:10:37.561
<v Speaker 2>was next.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

217
00:10:37.561 --> 00:10:38.394
<v Speaker 2>And especially in those first few days </v>
<v Speaker 2>where we didn't know if another attack </v>

218
00:10:39.961 --> 00:10:44.820
<v Speaker 2>was coming or anything like what was </v>
<v Speaker 2>actually the job of Fema for those first</v>

219
00:10:44.821 --> 00:10:45.654
<v Speaker 2>few days.</v>

220
00:10:45.690 --> 00:10:47.380
<v Speaker 2>We are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

221
00:10:48.120 --> 00:10:50.370
<v Speaker 2>we're the nation's federal first </v>
<v Speaker 2>responder.</v>

222
00:10:50.880 --> 00:10:53.190
<v Speaker 2>We coordinate all of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>

223
00:10:53.191 --> 00:10:54.024
<v Speaker 2>if the Pentagon ground zero,</v>
<v Speaker 2>our job was to make sure that we have </v>

224
00:10:56.430 --> 00:10:59.010
<v Speaker 2>all the urban search and rescue teams </v>
<v Speaker 2>deployed,</v>

225
00:10:59.550 --> 00:11:02.100
<v Speaker 2>that we take care of the firefighters,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we provide all the equipment,</v>

226
00:11:02.101 --> 00:11:04.680
<v Speaker 2>we provide the training,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we do all of that stuff.</v>

227
00:11:04.681 --> 00:11:05.514
<v Speaker 2>So our job was to clean up ground zero.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Our job was at the Pentagon to help </v>

228
00:11:08.941 --> 00:11:09.774
<v Speaker 2>clean that up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And what was fascinating about it was </v>

229
00:11:13.050 --> 00:11:16.470
<v Speaker 2>normally you go to a disaster.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not also a crime scene,</v>

230
00:11:16.830 --> 00:11:17.663
<v Speaker 2>but in this case,</v>
<v Speaker 2>both the Pentagon and in and in and in </v>

231
00:11:20.850 --> 00:11:23.070
<v Speaker 2>Pennsylvania and obviously in ground </v>
<v Speaker 2>zero,</v>

232
00:11:23.430 --> 00:11:24.263
<v Speaker 2>they were also crime scenes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so we now had to coordinate talking </v>

233
00:11:27.081 --> 00:11:28.980
<v Speaker 2>about federalism.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So now we had to coordinate,</v>

234
00:11:29.070 --> 00:11:30.090
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the federal government,</v>

235
00:11:30.091 --> 00:11:31.500
<v Speaker 2>state government,</v>
<v Speaker 2>local government,</v>

236
00:11:31.790 --> 00:11:34.170
<v Speaker 2>and on top of that we had to coordinate </v>
<v Speaker 2>with the CIA,</v>

237
00:11:34.171 --> 00:11:35.940
<v Speaker 2>the FBI,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the NSA,</v>

238
00:11:35.941 --> 00:11:38.730
<v Speaker 2>and everybody else who's doing all of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the forensic work.</v>

239
00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:40.320
<v Speaker 2>How does that go?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

240
00:11:40.560 --> 00:11:41.393
<v Speaker 2>one of the things we talk about here a </v>
<v Speaker 2>lot is sort of the unwieldy giant </v>

241
00:11:43.681 --> 00:11:44.514
<v Speaker 2>government we have right now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sort of all the middlemen and </v>

242
00:11:46.021 --> 00:11:47.690
<v Speaker 2>bureaucrats.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They get in the way of everything.</v>

243
00:11:47.880 --> 00:11:48.910
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how did it really go up?</v>

244
00:11:48.930 --> 00:11:51.060
<v Speaker 2>That's your job.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Here's what's fascinating.</v>

245
00:11:51.810 --> 00:11:55.330
<v Speaker 2>When the governments under pressure like</v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

246
00:11:56.170 --> 00:11:57.003
<v Speaker 2>everybody does what you have to meet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My mother in law had to say that drove </v>

247
00:12:00.011 --> 00:12:01.450
<v Speaker 2>my drives,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my wife crazy shoot,</v>

248
00:12:01.540 --> 00:12:02.680
<v Speaker 2>she's now deceased,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it was,</v>

249
00:12:02.950 --> 00:12:03.783
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sometimes you just have to do what you </v>

250
00:12:04.391 --> 00:12:08.290
<v Speaker 2>have to do and when,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when a crisis hits of that magnitude,</v>

251
00:12:08.560 --> 00:12:11.380
<v Speaker 2>it's all hands on deck and if you need </v>
<v Speaker 2>to break the rules,</v>

252
00:12:11.440 --> 00:12:13.660
<v Speaker 2>people are willing to break the rules to</v>
<v Speaker 2>make things happen.</v>

253
00:12:14.020 --> 00:12:15.700
<v Speaker 2>So I would say that in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>

254
00:12:15.730 --> 00:12:16.563
<v Speaker 2>in those intense moments,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's probably when the government </v>

255
00:12:19.571 --> 00:12:20.404
<v Speaker 2>tends to do the best job because </v>
<v Speaker 2>everybody's trying their hardest to do </v>

256
00:12:25.271 --> 00:12:26.530
<v Speaker 2>what's best for the country.</v>

257
00:12:26.770 --> 00:12:27.603
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So how soon after that did a debbie tap </v>

258
00:12:31.601 --> 00:12:34.300
<v Speaker 2>you to be the head of FEMA?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

259
00:12:34.330 --> 00:12:35.410
<v Speaker 2>let's see.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

260
00:12:35.500 --> 00:12:36.333
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>shortly after I became the deputy </v>

261
00:12:37.271 --> 00:12:39.130
<v Speaker 2>director,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would say like just a couple of months</v>

262
00:12:39.130 --> 00:12:39.963
<v Speaker 2>later,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I went from general counsel to deputy </v>

263
00:12:41.051 --> 00:12:41.884
<v Speaker 2>director of when they announced the </v>
<v Speaker 2>creation of the department will story </v>

264
00:12:45.701 --> 00:12:50.050
<v Speaker 2>about the creation of dhs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they're going to create the DHS.</v>

265
00:12:50.260 --> 00:12:51.093
<v Speaker 2>So w points me to the transition team,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're one of five people putting </v>

266
00:12:54.491 --> 00:12:55.324
<v Speaker 2>together the department.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I apologized to the nation for that </v>

267
00:12:57.551 --> 00:13:00.190
<v Speaker 2>because I've got lots of regrets about </v>
<v Speaker 2>dhs.</v>

268
00:13:00.210 --> 00:13:02.560
<v Speaker 2>I'm happy to talk.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We will.</v>

269
00:13:02.830 --> 00:13:03.663
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then soon thereafter all ball left </v>

270
00:13:06.160 --> 00:13:08.860
<v Speaker 2>and that's when I became the under </v>
<v Speaker 2>secretary and the director of Fema.</v>

271
00:13:08.861 --> 00:13:10.450
<v Speaker 2>So probably within,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Gosh,</v>

272
00:13:10.510 --> 00:13:11.500
<v Speaker 2>a year.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

273
00:13:11.580 --> 00:13:12.740
<v Speaker 2>Oh.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then just,</v>

274
00:13:13.020 --> 00:13:14.290
<v Speaker 2>it's the mailman story.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

275
00:13:14.291 --> 00:13:15.940
<v Speaker 2>you start in the mail room and you work </v>
<v Speaker 2>your way up.</v>

276
00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:17.620
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And on the two years after that,</v>

277
00:13:17.900 --> 00:13:20.320
<v Speaker 2>then the other crisis,</v>
<v Speaker 2>certainly.</v>

278
00:13:20.620 --> 00:13:21.453
<v Speaker 2>So tell me a little bit about your </v>
<v Speaker 2>regrets creating the Department of </v>

279
00:13:24.550 --> 00:13:25.383
<v Speaker 2>Homeland Security.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Here's a backstory first that most </v>

280
00:13:26.891 --> 00:13:27.724
<v Speaker 2>people don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The administration was opposed to the </v>

281
00:13:29.231 --> 00:13:31.330
<v Speaker 2>creation of the department.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We thought it was a mistake,</v>

282
00:13:31.360 --> 00:13:32.193
<v Speaker 2>huge mistake.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're going to create this massive </v>

283
00:13:33.971 --> 00:13:34.804
<v Speaker 2>bureaucracy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why things are working the way they're </v>

284
00:13:35.921 --> 00:13:36.754
<v Speaker 2>supposed to work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But Congress felt this political desire </v>

285
00:13:40.630 --> 00:13:42.430
<v Speaker 2>that you have to be seen doing </v>
<v Speaker 2>something.</v>

286
00:13:42.790 --> 00:13:44.230
<v Speaker 2>So once congress said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

287
00:13:44.231 --> 00:13:48.190
<v Speaker 2>we're going to move forward with </v>
<v Speaker 2>legislation than the White House says,</v>

288
00:13:48.191 --> 00:13:49.024
<v Speaker 2>oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 2>now we've got to get in front of this </v>

289
00:13:50.950 --> 00:13:54.190
<v Speaker 2>because we want to control it and mold </v>
<v Speaker 2>it in our own view,</v>

290
00:13:54.191 --> 00:13:57.130
<v Speaker 2>not congress's view,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because in effect they don't want to get</v>

291
00:13:57.160 --> 00:14:01.730
<v Speaker 2>legislation put on his desk that he lido</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then it's like he's against almost.</v>

292
00:14:01.990 --> 00:14:02.840
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>

293
00:14:03.070 --> 00:14:06.620
<v Speaker 2>So our job was an example of how screwed</v>
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>

294
00:14:06.690 --> 00:14:09.970
<v Speaker 2>so I'm thrown me and four other guys </v>
<v Speaker 2>with Clay Johnson,</v>

295
00:14:09.971 --> 00:14:11.860
<v Speaker 2>the president's best friend,</v>
<v Speaker 2>college roommate,</v>

296
00:14:12.190 --> 00:14:13.023
<v Speaker 2>a deputy director of omb were thrown </v>
<v Speaker 2>together to create this massive new </v>

297
00:14:15.821 --> 00:14:18.700
<v Speaker 2>bureaucracy by taking 22 different </v>
<v Speaker 2>cultures,</v>

298
00:14:18.760 --> 00:14:19.593
<v Speaker 2>22 different cultures,</v>
<v Speaker 2>22 different organizations and throwing </v>

299
00:14:22.421 --> 00:14:24.340
<v Speaker 2>them in together and trying to make it </v>
<v Speaker 2>work.</v>

300
00:14:24.520 --> 00:14:26.370
<v Speaker 2>What are a couple of those organizations</v>
<v Speaker 2>that were thrown in there?</v>

301
00:14:26.371 --> 00:14:27.071
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's everybody,</v>

302
00:14:27.071 --> 00:14:27.670
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

303
00:14:27.670 --> 00:14:29.800
<v Speaker 2>it was secret secret service.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What the hell,</v>

304
00:14:29.801 --> 00:14:32.090
<v Speaker 2>Secret Service and homeland security.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

305
00:14:32.230 --> 00:14:33.650
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the coast guard,</v>

306
00:14:33.820 --> 00:14:37.690
<v Speaker 2>the coast guard has this kind of </v>
<v Speaker 2>schizophrenia role.</v>

307
00:14:37.900 --> 00:14:38.733
<v Speaker 2>They've worked for homeland security,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yet they're subjected to the military </v>

308
00:14:41.501 --> 00:14:42.334
<v Speaker 2>code of conduct and they kind of </v>
<v Speaker 2>technical work for pimp for the </v>

309
00:14:44.051 --> 00:14:45.940
<v Speaker 2>Pentagon,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so we've got all of the.</v>

310
00:14:46.410 --> 00:14:47.243
<v Speaker 2>You've got that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have ice customs and border patrol </v>

311
00:14:49.300 --> 00:14:50.133
<v Speaker 2>immigration,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a different grants from the Department </v>

312
00:14:54.080 --> 00:14:54.913
<v Speaker 2>of Justice Fema.</v>

313
00:14:55.310 --> 00:14:56.143
<v Speaker 2>Everybody had a different culture and my</v>
<v Speaker 2>objection was you can't throw different </v>

314
00:15:02.511 --> 00:15:06.960
<v Speaker 2>cultures together and really expect them</v>
<v Speaker 2>to work either in the short term and the</v>

315
00:15:07.040 --> 00:15:08.840
<v Speaker 2>longterm.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Every organization,</v>

316
00:15:08.870 --> 00:15:09.980
<v Speaker 2>corporate,</v>
<v Speaker 2>private,</v>

317
00:15:10.010 --> 00:15:10.843
<v Speaker 2>governmental has a culture and trying to</v>
<v Speaker 2>meld those is the one of the most </v>

318
00:15:13.911 --> 00:15:15.540
<v Speaker 2>difficult things to do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look,</v>

319
00:15:15.890 --> 00:15:18.440
<v Speaker 2>I love Carly Fiorina.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Consider her a friend,</v>

320
00:15:18.800 --> 00:15:19.633
<v Speaker 2>but they brought in to talk to us about </v>
<v Speaker 2>how to do mergers and acquisitions and </v>

321
00:15:24.501 --> 00:15:25.700
<v Speaker 2>I'm thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wait a minute,</v>

322
00:15:26.690 --> 00:15:27.523
<v Speaker 2>the HP and merger and acquisition,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that didn't seem to go too well and </v>

323
00:15:30.681 --> 00:15:33.770
<v Speaker 2>you're going to tell us how to do this </v>
<v Speaker 2>22 government agency thing.</v>

324
00:15:33.980 --> 00:15:35.060
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's one objection.</v>

325
00:15:35.420 --> 00:15:37.350
<v Speaker 2>The second objection was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

326
00:15:37.400 --> 00:15:38.233
<v Speaker 2>we got to airports with a major concern </v>
<v Speaker 2>and for whatever reason we wanted to </v>

327
00:15:42.771 --> 00:15:43.604
<v Speaker 2>blame the private contractors who have a</v>
<v Speaker 2>vested interest in making sure that the </v>

328
00:15:46.821 --> 00:15:48.050
<v Speaker 2>airlines are secure,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

329
00:15:48.410 --> 00:15:50.330
<v Speaker 2>But that's not good enough.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Instead,</v>

330
00:15:50.510 --> 00:15:51.343
<v Speaker 2>let's fire all of them and let's create </v>
<v Speaker 2>this massive new bureaucracy called the </v>

331
00:15:54.321 --> 00:15:56.690
<v Speaker 2>Tsa.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I'm,</v>

332
00:15:56.780 --> 00:15:57.613
<v Speaker 2>I'm like the kid in the back of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>classroom that keeps raising his hand </v>

333
00:16:00.411 --> 00:16:03.790
<v Speaker 2>and say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but professor y w,</v>

334
00:16:03.980 --> 00:16:05.870
<v Speaker 2>how's that gonna work?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

335
00:16:06.590 --> 00:16:09.740
<v Speaker 2>but there was just this way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What would happen when he said something</v>

336
00:16:09.741 --> 00:16:12.080
<v Speaker 2>like that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because now I think in 2018,</v>

337
00:16:12.081 --> 00:16:14.000
<v Speaker 2>if you say something about the Tsa,</v>
<v Speaker 2>most people that agree with you,</v>

338
00:16:14.020 --> 00:16:19.020
<v Speaker 2>that really ridiculous,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the reaction was always,</v>

339
00:16:19.910 --> 00:16:20.743
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're going to meet your objection by </v>

340
00:16:22.131 --> 00:16:22.964
<v Speaker 2>doing y.</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I had been around the block long </v>

341
00:16:26.571 --> 00:16:27.404
<v Speaker 2>enough to know that that answer was bs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But when you're the one person out of </v>

342
00:16:31.041 --> 00:16:32.610
<v Speaker 2>five,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're out voted.</v>

343
00:16:32.690 --> 00:16:34.550
<v Speaker 2>So you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

344
00:16:34.970 --> 00:16:35.803
<v Speaker 2>you tend to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a great Washington Post story </v>

345
00:16:37.880 --> 00:16:41.120
<v Speaker 2>that talks about brown as the </v>
<v Speaker 2>bureaucratic infighter.</v>

346
00:16:41.660 --> 00:16:45.830
<v Speaker 2>And I was in the post,</v>
<v Speaker 2>writes it as if that's a bad thing and I</v>

347
00:16:45.850 --> 00:16:46.683
<v Speaker 2>considered a badge of honor because I </v>
<v Speaker 2>was fighting for just the reality that </v>

348
00:16:51.140 --> 00:16:51.973
<v Speaker 2>when you tell me that putting these,</v>
<v Speaker 2>deploy these different agencies </v>

349
00:16:54.531 --> 00:16:56.120
<v Speaker 2>together,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's going to be budget neutral.</v>

350
00:16:56.180 --> 00:16:57.013
<v Speaker 2>That's BS.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When you tell me you're going to create </v>

351
00:16:58.671 --> 00:16:59.504
<v Speaker 2>Tsa,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you're going to prevent them from </v>

352
00:17:01.130 --> 00:17:01.963
<v Speaker 2>ever being a union.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's bs because I just know how </v>

353
00:17:04.641 --> 00:17:08.930
<v Speaker 2>government metastasizes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so the TSA has turned out to be what</v>

354
00:17:08.931 --> 00:17:11.990
<v Speaker 2>I thought it was the dysfunction within </v>
<v Speaker 2>dhs.</v>

355
00:17:12.290 --> 00:17:16.730
<v Speaker 2>While it may be minimally better,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's still a dysfunctional organization.</v>

356
00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:19.370
<v Speaker 2>So let's back up for a second,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because you mentioned that before this,</v>

357
00:17:19.371 --> 00:17:20.204
<v Speaker 2>the security.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Was it all done by private companies </v>

358
00:17:22.071 --> 00:17:24.410
<v Speaker 2>before the TSA?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's almost hard to believe.</v>

359
00:17:24.510 --> 00:17:26.750
<v Speaker 2>Or was it all done by private?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

360
00:17:27.390 --> 00:17:27.790
<v Speaker 2>The,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

361
00:17:27.790 --> 00:17:28.623
<v Speaker 2>the airlines who have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who has the most now you think about </v>

362
00:17:31.401 --> 00:17:35.300
<v Speaker 2>just trying to figure out what's the </v>
<v Speaker 2>best way to put a program together.</v>

363
00:17:35.540 --> 00:17:36.373
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who has the most interest in making </v>

364
00:17:38.841 --> 00:17:43.280
<v Speaker 2>certain that they're planes are never </v>
<v Speaker 2>hijacked or flown into buildings.</v>

365
00:17:43.550 --> 00:17:44.720
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the airlines.</v>

366
00:17:45.110 --> 00:17:48.530
<v Speaker 2>Why don't we let them decide security,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because what do they have?</v>

367
00:17:48.530 --> 00:17:51.180
<v Speaker 2>Competing interests.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They want to make sure that their planes</v>

368
00:17:51.181 --> 00:17:53.640
<v Speaker 2>are secure,</v>
<v Speaker 2>their passengers are safe,</v>

369
00:17:53.700 --> 00:17:57.000
<v Speaker 2>but that the security operates in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>most efficient and effective way.</v>

370
00:17:57.420 --> 00:17:58.253
<v Speaker 2>Now you tell me government's going to </v>
<v Speaker 2>care about those three things be as </v>

371
00:18:01.550 --> 00:18:02.383
<v Speaker 2>well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's also interesting because it's like </v>

372
00:18:03.121 --> 00:18:03.954
<v Speaker 2>what a great lady used competition in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the right sense where it's like this </v>

373
00:18:06.871 --> 00:18:09.420
<v Speaker 2>airline that's doing it the right way </v>
<v Speaker 2>where they could go,</v>

374
00:18:09.421 --> 00:18:11.760
<v Speaker 2>you know what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look at our marks on security,</v>

375
00:18:11.761 --> 00:18:12.594
<v Speaker 2>so we're charging you $5 more than a lot</v>
<v Speaker 2>of people wouldn't have a problem with </v>

376
00:18:14.791 --> 00:18:15.710
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It would.</v>

377
00:18:15.770 --> 00:18:16.603
<v Speaker 2>It would be a beautiful thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't realize that it was fully </v>

378
00:18:18.271 --> 00:18:20.010
<v Speaker 2>private before that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

379
00:18:20.160 --> 00:18:21.590
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So any other.</v>

380
00:18:21.640 --> 00:18:25.380
<v Speaker 2>I mean that's a pretty big issue,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but any other big regrets related to.</v>

381
00:18:26.040 --> 00:18:26.970
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>

382
00:18:27.030 --> 00:18:31.320
<v Speaker 2>we have within fema what was called the </v>
<v Speaker 2>catastrophic disaster response group.</v>

383
00:18:31.640 --> 00:18:33.000
<v Speaker 2>Everything is an acronym,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so it was,</v>

384
00:18:33.050 --> 00:18:38.050
<v Speaker 2>it was the Crg and because the FEMA </v>
<v Speaker 2>director under under federal law,</v>

385
00:18:38.820 --> 00:18:42.660
<v Speaker 2>when in times of disaster reports </v>
<v Speaker 2>directly to the president,</v>

386
00:18:42.960 --> 00:18:45.900
<v Speaker 2>you're the of representative,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so this cdr,</v>

387
00:18:45.901 --> 00:18:47.670
<v Speaker 2>gee,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when there was a disaster,</v>

388
00:18:47.700 --> 00:18:48.533
<v Speaker 2>like nine slash 11,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we brought all of the cabinet </v>

389
00:18:50.491 --> 00:18:51.324
<v Speaker 2>departments and agencies together,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so usually had the deputy secretaries </v>

390
00:18:54.510 --> 00:18:55.343
<v Speaker 2>there because they were there on behalf </v>
<v Speaker 2>of their bosses and we would deconflict </v>

391
00:18:59.911 --> 00:19:00.744
<v Speaker 2>policy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We would set priorities and if State </v>

392
00:19:05.310 --> 00:19:06.143
<v Speaker 2>Department wanted to do one thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but dod you wanted to do another and ag </v>

393
00:19:08.821 --> 00:19:09.654
<v Speaker 2>wanted to do something else.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was where we got all of those </v>

394
00:19:11.761 --> 00:19:12.594
<v Speaker 2>deconflicted because the FEMA director </v>
<v Speaker 2>had the authority of the president </v>

395
00:19:17.400 --> 00:19:19.030
<v Speaker 2>sitting in that room.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

396
00:19:19.260 --> 00:19:20.093
<v Speaker 2>that's gone away now and you've thrown </v>
<v Speaker 2>these all together and I've always said </v>

397
00:19:24.330 --> 00:19:25.163
<v Speaker 2>if you want to find out whether a </v>
<v Speaker 2>disaster is being handled properly or </v>

398
00:19:28.711 --> 00:19:29.940
<v Speaker 2>not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or any sort of crisis,</v>

399
00:19:30.120 --> 00:19:32.460
<v Speaker 2>this could be in the private sector to </v>
<v Speaker 2>ask this question,</v>

400
00:19:33.060 --> 00:19:33.893
<v Speaker 2>who's in charge?</v>

401
00:19:34.680 --> 00:19:37.560
<v Speaker 2>If you can't answer the question,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who's in charge,</v>

402
00:19:37.830 --> 00:19:41.970
<v Speaker 2>then it's a cluster.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is there an inherent sort of.</v>

403
00:19:42.260 --> 00:19:43.093
<v Speaker 2>There's a conflict here which is that </v>
<v Speaker 2>basically you're taking government </v>

404
00:19:45.271 --> 00:19:49.170
<v Speaker 2>people and for someone like you that </v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe wanted less government,</v>

405
00:19:49.410 --> 00:19:50.243
<v Speaker 2>and I think this is what you're really </v>
<v Speaker 2>saying about Bush at the beginning of </v>

406
00:19:52.360 --> 00:19:53.280
<v Speaker 2>this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't want this,</v>

407
00:19:53.281 --> 00:19:54.440
<v Speaker 2>the administration,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he didn't write it,</v>

408
00:19:54.850 --> 00:19:55.683
<v Speaker 2>but government,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and this is the problem with </v>

409
00:19:56.731 --> 00:19:59.550
<v Speaker 2>Libertarians in general,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like people that want less government.</v>

410
00:19:59.551 --> 00:20:00.540
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're in the government,</v>

411
00:20:00.541 --> 00:20:02.460
<v Speaker 2>it's hard to look around the office and </v>
<v Speaker 2>be like,</v>

412
00:20:02.461 --> 00:20:03.151
<v Speaker 2>guys,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

413
00:20:03.151 --> 00:20:04.950
<v Speaker 2>most of us probably shouldn't even be </v>
<v Speaker 2>here.</v>

414
00:20:05.180 --> 00:20:05.710
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're,</v>

415
00:20:05.710 --> 00:20:06.543
<v Speaker 2>we're going to need new jobs guys.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So in Fema first started in 1979 under </v>

416
00:20:09.931 --> 00:20:10.764
<v Speaker 2>Jimmy Carter,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they had a policy of providing ice to </v>

417
00:20:13.351 --> 00:20:17.550
<v Speaker 2>hospitals so that lactating mothers had </v>
<v Speaker 2>a place where they could keep milk,</v>

418
00:20:17.850 --> 00:20:18.683
<v Speaker 2>where you could keep insulin and other </v>
<v Speaker 2>medicines that require pharmaceuticals </v>

419
00:20:21.321 --> 00:20:22.530
<v Speaker 2>or require refrigeration.</v>

420
00:20:22.890 --> 00:20:23.723
<v Speaker 2>That ice was for hospitals to provide </v>
<v Speaker 2>their local communities a place for the </v>

421
00:20:27.241 --> 00:20:31.950
<v Speaker 2>medicines to say stay cool and safe and </v>
<v Speaker 2>everything else that has metastasized,</v>

422
00:20:31.951 --> 00:20:32.784
<v Speaker 2>which is my favorite word of government.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It has metastasized now to where in a </v>

423
00:20:36.211 --> 00:20:39.030
<v Speaker 2>disaster we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we provide every Tom,</v>

424
00:20:39.031 --> 00:20:39.864
<v Speaker 2>Dick and Harry two bags of ice so that </v>
<v Speaker 2>they can keep their hamburger cold or </v>

425
00:20:42.681 --> 00:20:46.380
<v Speaker 2>there or the coors beer cold.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I went to Congress and said,</v>

426
00:20:46.620 --> 00:20:47.453
<v Speaker 2>this is out control.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're spending tens of millions of </v>

427
00:20:49.840 --> 00:20:54.460
<v Speaker 2>dollars on ice so that a private citizen</v>
<v Speaker 2>can keep their food cold.</v>

428
00:20:54.490 --> 00:20:55.323
<v Speaker 2>Is that really a government function?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Even talking to conservatives on the </v>

429
00:20:59.471 --> 00:21:00.304
<v Speaker 2>hill,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let alone Democrats or liberals or </v>

430
00:21:02.231 --> 00:21:07.180
<v Speaker 2>anybody else.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was a heretic because we can't support</v>

431
00:21:07.181 --> 00:21:10.240
<v Speaker 2>that because that's taking something </v>
<v Speaker 2>away from our constituents.</v>

432
00:21:10.790 --> 00:21:13.810
<v Speaker 2>Would you reckon that you realize it's a</v>
<v Speaker 2>waste?</v>

433
00:21:13.811 --> 00:21:15.910
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why should we be doing that?</v>

434
00:21:16.120 --> 00:21:17.290
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we can't stop it now.</v>

435
00:21:17.740 --> 00:21:20.020
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's fascinating.</v>

436
00:21:20.021 --> 00:21:22.210
<v Speaker 2>And then you just get all these sort of </v>
<v Speaker 2>middle management,</v>

437
00:21:22.510 --> 00:21:23.800
<v Speaker 2>Kratz men.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

438
00:21:23.910 --> 00:21:25.230
<v Speaker 2>nobody's going to give up that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

439
00:21:25.540 --> 00:21:26.400
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

440
00:21:26.410 --> 00:21:27.243
<v Speaker 2>was there anything else major between,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for you professionally between nine </v>

441
00:21:30.431 --> 00:21:32.380
<v Speaker 2>slash 11 and Katrina,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like what were,</v>

442
00:21:32.381 --> 00:21:33.214
<v Speaker 2>what were you doing before that was </v>
<v Speaker 2>instilled chess related and we had the </v>

443
00:21:37.061 --> 00:21:37.894
<v Speaker 2>Columbia space shuttle disaster,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which we had to coordinate with NASA </v>

444
00:21:40.121 --> 00:21:43.390
<v Speaker 2>because NASA was in shock.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we had to help them do all the search</v>

445
00:21:43.391 --> 00:21:44.224
<v Speaker 2>and rescue from California to Texas.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We had a huge wildfires in California </v>

446
00:21:49.211 --> 00:21:52.660
<v Speaker 2>that were just massive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Luckily they've recently experienced,</v>

447
00:21:52.661 --> 00:21:55.540
<v Speaker 2>we had fires throughout the west,</v>
<v Speaker 2>flooding in the Midwest.</v>

448
00:21:55.541 --> 00:21:58.900
<v Speaker 2>We had the tsunami in Southeast Asia.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I could go on and on and on.</v>

449
00:21:59.080 --> 00:21:59.913
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My life was just full of hell from nine </v>

450
00:22:01.421 --> 00:22:02.050
<v Speaker 2>slash 11 on.</v>

451
00:22:02.050 --> 00:22:05.590
<v Speaker 2>So until that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>until the Katrina moment.</v>

452
00:22:05.591 --> 00:22:08.260
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What was the general feeling about you?</v>

453
00:22:08.440 --> 00:22:11.740
<v Speaker 2>Because then now we'll get into this </v>
<v Speaker 2>where you were then used as.</v>

454
00:22:11.770 --> 00:22:12.640
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was competent,</v>

455
00:22:12.650 --> 00:22:15.370
<v Speaker 2>knew what I was doing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The White House always turned to me to,</v>

456
00:22:15.400 --> 00:22:16.990
<v Speaker 2>to get things done.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

457
00:22:17.950 --> 00:22:19.780
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

458
00:22:19.960 --> 00:22:20.621
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I'll,</v>

459
00:22:20.621 --> 00:22:21.900
<v Speaker 2>I'll take,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll take it,</v>

460
00:22:22.150 --> 00:22:22.983
<v Speaker 2>I'll take your word for it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But by and large you were thought of as </v>

461
00:22:24.551 --> 00:22:27.310
<v Speaker 2>a competent executive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And everything was okay,</v>

462
00:22:27.311 --> 00:22:28.690
<v Speaker 2>so now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>now feeding habits.</v>

463
00:22:28.720 --> 00:22:31.060
<v Speaker 2>I love the story that you told right at </v>
<v Speaker 2>the beginning because what a,</v>

464
00:22:31.330 --> 00:22:35.050
<v Speaker 2>what a perfect story of like just awful </v>
<v Speaker 2>abusive power.</v>

465
00:22:35.051 --> 00:22:37.360
<v Speaker 2>Go check out my home instead of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

466
00:22:37.370 --> 00:22:38.203
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the disaster areas and all that kind of </v>

467
00:22:39.401 --> 00:22:40.720
<v Speaker 2>stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

468
00:22:40.780 --> 00:22:41.613
<v Speaker 2>how does it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how does it,</v>

469
00:22:41.770 --> 00:22:42.603
<v Speaker 2>there was a certain amount of time we </v>
<v Speaker 2>knew that this thing was going to be a </v>

470
00:22:45.790 --> 00:22:46.450
<v Speaker 2>crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

471
00:22:46.450 --> 00:22:47.980
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how long before it happened?</v>

472
00:22:47.981 --> 00:22:48.814
<v Speaker 2>It was going to be crazy because we had,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had gone to Congress and ask for an </v>

473
00:22:51.671 --> 00:22:52.504
<v Speaker 2>appropriation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I actually wanted to spend some tax </v>

474
00:22:54.521 --> 00:22:59.230
<v Speaker 2>money to plan for 10 truly catastrophic </v>
<v Speaker 2>disasters.</v>

475
00:22:59.560 --> 00:23:01.030
<v Speaker 2>Something like a hurricane.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You,</v>

476
00:23:01.040 --> 00:23:04.210
<v Speaker 2>your former New Yorker.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Can you imagine a category five going up</v>

477
00:23:04.211 --> 00:23:05.044
<v Speaker 2>the Hudson river?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Can you imagine something happening to </v>

478
00:23:07.481 --> 00:23:12.070
<v Speaker 2>the LNG natural gas,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a port in Boston,</v>

479
00:23:12.340 --> 00:23:13.173
<v Speaker 2>a terrorist incident there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Imagine the big one hitting California </v>

480
00:23:15.971 --> 00:23:19.850
<v Speaker 2>or the new magid fault.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Imagine because New Orleans a Fishbowl,</v>

481
00:23:19.860 --> 00:23:20.693
<v Speaker 2>a category five filling up New Orleans.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So Congress had given me money to start </v>

482
00:23:23.951 --> 00:23:26.350
<v Speaker 2>doing catastrophic planning for these </v>
<v Speaker 2>kinds of things.</v>

483
00:23:27.010 --> 00:23:27.843
<v Speaker 2>New Orleans was the first one we picked </v>
<v Speaker 2>and when we did a tabletop exercise to </v>

484
00:23:33.371 --> 00:23:37.660
<v Speaker 2>see if we could coordinate the response,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the table top exercise fell apart,</v>

485
00:23:37.661 --> 00:23:41.170
<v Speaker 2>Dave,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I knew probably nine,</v>

486
00:23:41.180 --> 00:23:44.950
<v Speaker 2>12 months before Katrina actually </v>
<v Speaker 2>occurred that we weren't ready.</v>

487
00:23:45.200 --> 00:23:46.033
<v Speaker 2>So what does that actually mean when </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're doing a table top exercise that </v>

488
00:23:47.841 --> 00:23:48.674
<v Speaker 2>that's just coordinating all the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all the players in the room and you </v>

489
00:23:52.071 --> 00:23:54.680
<v Speaker 2>pretend like you're going through a </v>
<v Speaker 2>disaster.</v>

490
00:23:54.860 --> 00:23:56.030
<v Speaker 2>So what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What are you doing?</v>

491
00:23:56.060 --> 00:23:57.170
<v Speaker 2>What are you doing?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What are you doing?</v>

492
00:23:57.171 --> 00:24:00.110
<v Speaker 2>What are the conflicts?</v>
<v Speaker 2>How do we deconflict all of these policy</v>

493
00:24:00.111 --> 00:24:02.000
<v Speaker 2>issues?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do we have enough food?</v>

494
00:24:02.001 --> 00:24:06.290
<v Speaker 2>How do we get dod to dod?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Have enough equipment on hand,</v>

495
00:24:06.330 --> 00:24:08.210
<v Speaker 2>Gideon food supplies and everything </v>
<v Speaker 2>else.</v>

496
00:24:08.450 --> 00:24:13.450
<v Speaker 2>You exercise that around the table and </v>
<v Speaker 2>Louisiana fell apart.</v>

497
00:24:14.600 --> 00:24:15.770
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wouldn't work.</v>

498
00:24:16.520 --> 00:24:20.930
<v Speaker 2>Was it right at the beginning of it that</v>
<v Speaker 2>you realized how severe it was?</v>

499
00:24:21.230 --> 00:24:25.250
<v Speaker 2>I've been criticized because in May of </v>
<v Speaker 2>2005,</v>

500
00:24:25.460 --> 00:24:28.310
<v Speaker 2>I had my wife.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is before.</v>

501
00:24:28.380 --> 00:24:29.970
<v Speaker 2>Before busy for Katrina?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

502
00:24:30.140 --> 00:24:32.750
<v Speaker 2>It may of 2005.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Several Friends of mine,</v>

503
00:24:32.751 --> 00:24:34.790
<v Speaker 2>including Colin Powell,</v>
<v Speaker 2>had said,</v>

504
00:24:34.910 --> 00:24:37.640
<v Speaker 2>you know what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's probably time to leave and I,</v>

505
00:24:37.700 --> 00:24:38.780
<v Speaker 2>I asked them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>seriously,</v>

506
00:24:38.781 --> 00:24:39.614
<v Speaker 2>why is it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

507
00:24:40.280 --> 00:24:45.280
<v Speaker 2>you've done everything that you can do </v>
<v Speaker 2>in terms of trying to mold dhs into what</v>

508
00:24:45.771 --> 00:24:49.370
<v Speaker 2>you think it should be and nothing else </v>
<v Speaker 2>is going to happen.</v>

509
00:24:49.460 --> 00:24:52.640
<v Speaker 2>It is what it is that you have.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have fought the good fight.</v>

510
00:24:52.940 --> 00:24:54.860
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you've been here six years,</v>

511
00:24:55.160 --> 00:24:56.900
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and of course my wife was,</v>

512
00:24:56.920 --> 00:24:57.753
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's time to go back to Colorado to go </v>

513
00:24:58.611 --> 00:25:01.580
<v Speaker 2>back to Colorado.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so I told Andy Card,</v>

514
00:25:02.030 --> 00:25:02.863
<v Speaker 2>the White House chief of staff in </v>
<v Speaker 2>malleable five that I wanted to resign </v>

515
00:25:06.531 --> 00:25:10.040
<v Speaker 2>and go back to Colorado.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And what typically happens,</v>

516
00:25:10.610 --> 00:25:11.443
<v Speaker 2>Andy said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>can you wait till Labor Day and go </v>

517
00:25:15.531 --> 00:25:16.364
<v Speaker 2>through one more hurricane season for us</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that will give us time to find a </v>

518
00:25:19.701 --> 00:25:20.534
<v Speaker 2>replacement.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now when the president asks you to stay </v>

519
00:25:22.581 --> 00:25:24.680
<v Speaker 2>for five more months,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sure,</v>

520
00:25:24.740 --> 00:25:26.720
<v Speaker 2>I can do that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

521
00:25:27.170 --> 00:25:27.881
<v Speaker 2>Labor Day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What?</v>

522
00:25:27.881 --> 00:25:29.930
<v Speaker 2>What was the day that Katrina hit?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was August 29th.</v>

523
00:25:30.320 --> 00:25:32.380
<v Speaker 2>August 29 Labor Day,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever it is,</v>

524
00:25:32.990 --> 00:25:34.830
<v Speaker 2>eight days later.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

525
00:25:34.910 --> 00:25:35.540
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

526
00:25:35.540 --> 00:25:36.920
<v Speaker 2>so it hits.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

527
00:25:36.921 --> 00:25:39.980
<v Speaker 2>I can remember watching everything on </v>
<v Speaker 2>CNN at the time.</v>

528
00:25:40.220 --> 00:25:41.150
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you mentioned Nagan.</v>

529
00:25:41.151 --> 00:25:42.730
<v Speaker 2>Who is the mayor?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

530
00:25:43.290 --> 00:25:44.610
<v Speaker 2>mayor of New Orleans.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Lauren's.</v>

531
00:25:45.800 --> 00:25:47.930
<v Speaker 2>How chaotic was it to coordinate?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You've already,</v>

532
00:25:47.990 --> 00:25:51.120
<v Speaker 2>after you said this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this initial test had failed about.</v>

533
00:25:51.210 --> 00:25:52.880
<v Speaker 2>It was for.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was a,</v>

534
00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:56.990
<v Speaker 2>it was virtually impossible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I landed the superdome.</v>

535
00:25:57.020 --> 00:25:57.950
<v Speaker 2>The superdome.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

536
00:25:57.970 --> 00:25:58.803
<v Speaker 2>let's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's go back a step before I actually </v>

537
00:26:02.031 --> 00:26:05.510
<v Speaker 2>went to New Orleans before the storm </v>
<v Speaker 2>made landfall,</v>

538
00:26:06.020 --> 00:26:06.853
<v Speaker 2>Max Mayfield,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who was the director of the National </v>

539
00:26:08.990 --> 00:26:12.290
<v Speaker 2>Hurricane Center fellow Okie.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He and I go on the phone together and we</v>

540
00:26:12.291 --> 00:26:13.124
<v Speaker 2>knew how bad the storm is going to be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we could not get the attention of </v>

541
00:26:16.550 --> 00:26:17.383
<v Speaker 2>state officials and frankly we couldn't </v>
<v Speaker 2>get the attention of the dod and State </v>

542
00:26:22.670 --> 00:26:23.503
<v Speaker 2>Department,</v>
<v Speaker 2>other people that would be playing a </v>

543
00:26:23.891 --> 00:26:24.980
<v Speaker 2>role.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How is that possible?</v>

544
00:26:24.981 --> 00:26:25.814
<v Speaker 2>You now had this new dhs that was </v>
<v Speaker 2>supposed to be cool because who's in </v>

545
00:26:30.201 --> 00:26:31.820
<v Speaker 2>charge?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I remember who's in charge.</v>

546
00:26:32.180 --> 00:26:33.013
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everybody's now competing for their </v>

547
00:26:35.240 --> 00:26:36.980
<v Speaker 2>pecking order because of dhs.</v>

548
00:26:37.700 --> 00:26:40.410
<v Speaker 2>So I tell Max Mayfield,</v>
<v Speaker 2>would you please explain this?</v>

549
00:26:40.411 --> 00:26:43.680
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to have bushes and Crawford.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He'll be on civic call,</v>

550
00:26:43.681 --> 00:26:48.030
<v Speaker 2>this top secret phone conference,</v>
<v Speaker 2>video and everything,</v>

551
00:26:48.600 --> 00:26:51.570
<v Speaker 2>and I'll have the mayor,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the governor of all the Gulf states,</v>

552
00:26:51.571 --> 00:26:56.280
<v Speaker 2>their job will be there for Florida a </v>
<v Speaker 2>and I need you to read them the riot act</v>

553
00:26:56.460 --> 00:26:59.430
<v Speaker 2>about how bad this is going to be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he did,</v>

554
00:27:00.240 --> 00:27:01.073
<v Speaker 2>and then I pulled out an engineering </v>
<v Speaker 2>report that said the New Orleans </v>

555
00:27:04.770 --> 00:27:05.603
<v Speaker 2>superdome cannot even withstand a </v>
<v Speaker 2>category three based upon engineering </v>

556
00:27:08.521 --> 00:27:09.354
<v Speaker 2>reports,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the mayor just announced that he's </v>

557
00:27:10.921 --> 00:27:13.260
<v Speaker 2>going to use the superdome is a shelter </v>
<v Speaker 2>of last resort.</v>

558
00:27:13.650 --> 00:27:16.260
<v Speaker 2>I'm screaming on this call and you can't</v>
<v Speaker 2>do that.</v>

559
00:27:16.261 --> 00:27:17.490
<v Speaker 2>That's a huge mistake.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Blah,</v>

560
00:27:17.491 --> 00:27:18.300
<v Speaker 2>blah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>blah.</v>

561
00:27:18.300 --> 00:27:19.133
<v Speaker 2>At this point,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what?</v>

562
00:27:19.140 --> 00:27:20.820
<v Speaker 2>What category did they think it was </v>
<v Speaker 2>gonna be?</v>

563
00:27:20.850 --> 00:27:22.980
<v Speaker 2>We thought it was gonna be a fight when </v>
<v Speaker 2>it actually hit.</v>

564
00:27:22.980 --> 00:27:23.813
<v Speaker 2>It was a three,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but as we all know is still ripped off </v>

565
00:27:26.221 --> 00:27:28.720
<v Speaker 2>the roof of the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Of the superdome?</v>

566
00:27:28.800 --> 00:27:30.330
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I knew going in,</v>

567
00:27:30.331 --> 00:27:31.164
<v Speaker 2>it was gonna be bad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I say all that to lead to this one </v>

568
00:27:33.091 --> 00:27:33.924
<v Speaker 2>point,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the day that I'm leaving to fly to to </v>

569
00:27:38.050 --> 00:27:40.560
<v Speaker 2>baton rouge.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I remember exactly where I was.</v>

570
00:27:40.561 --> 00:27:42.470
<v Speaker 2>I was on one 95 going around the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

571
00:27:42.560 --> 00:27:43.393
<v Speaker 2>the Pentagon and I called Joe Hagan,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the deputy chief of staff to telling </v>

572
00:27:46.770 --> 00:27:49.050
<v Speaker 2>that I'm headed to Andrews.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going down,</v>

573
00:27:49.051 --> 00:27:51.030
<v Speaker 2>we're doing everything we can and I </v>
<v Speaker 2>said,</v>

574
00:27:51.031 --> 00:27:51.864
<v Speaker 2>Joe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but this is going to be a cluster </v>

575
00:27:52.981 --> 00:27:55.830
<v Speaker 2>because I can't get stuff coordinated </v>
<v Speaker 2>now.</v>

576
00:27:56.070 --> 00:27:56.903
<v Speaker 2>And the storm hasn't even hit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And because I had already told them I </v>

577
00:27:59.971 --> 00:28:03.870
<v Speaker 2>wanted to leave.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I said in an email to the and hey,</v>

578
00:28:03.871 --> 00:28:07.350
<v Speaker 2>can I quit now?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And of course everybody picks it up.</v>

579
00:28:07.380 --> 00:28:09.060
<v Speaker 2>Oh look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Brown doesn't care.</v>

580
00:28:09.300 --> 00:28:10.133
<v Speaker 2>He's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he wants to quit before the storm even </v>

581
00:28:11.310 --> 00:28:12.360
<v Speaker 2>hit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's fascinating.</v>

582
00:28:12.361 --> 00:28:13.290
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I remember that.</v>

583
00:28:13.430 --> 00:28:14.520
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I remember that.</v>

584
00:28:14.521 --> 00:28:16.070
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>

585
00:28:17.210 --> 00:28:18.870
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you were just being sarcastic.</v>

586
00:28:19.150 --> 00:28:20.550
<v Speaker 2>I'm a sarcastic guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

587
00:28:20.700 --> 00:28:21.533
<v Speaker 2>I'm a total smart ass.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so I had already agreed to stay </v>

588
00:28:26.281 --> 00:28:27.114
<v Speaker 2>through Labor Day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I knew I was walking into a buzzsaw and </v>

589
00:28:29.521 --> 00:28:30.840
<v Speaker 2>I'm telling Hagen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>

590
00:28:30.841 --> 00:28:32.430
<v Speaker 2>can I quit now?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And of course,</v>

591
00:28:32.431 --> 00:28:33.630
<v Speaker 2>the New York Times,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

592
00:28:33.870 --> 00:28:35.220
<v Speaker 2>for years,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all of my emails,</v>

593
00:28:35.221 --> 00:28:38.150
<v Speaker 2>they see the jokes that I crack because </v>
<v Speaker 2>let me tell you something,</v>

594
00:28:39.090 --> 00:28:41.580
<v Speaker 2>not to get off the subject here go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but when,</v>

595
00:28:41.940 --> 00:28:46.940
<v Speaker 2>when people are suffering and people </v>
<v Speaker 2>that are the rescue workers,</v>

596
00:28:47.020 --> 00:28:47.853
<v Speaker 2>the firefighters that are taking people </v>
<v Speaker 2>off roofs that are taking them out of </v>

597
00:28:51.570 --> 00:28:54.030
<v Speaker 2>flooded homes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're working their asses off,</v>

598
00:28:54.300 --> 00:28:56.100
<v Speaker 2>they're tired,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're worn out,</v>

599
00:28:56.130 --> 00:28:56.963
<v Speaker 2>they're stressed out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know what the best thing to do is </v>

600
00:28:59.580 --> 00:29:00.690
<v Speaker 2>give them a little humor.</v>

601
00:29:00.810 --> 00:29:01.980
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>show them.</v>

602
00:29:02.370 --> 00:29:05.960
<v Speaker 2>Show a little humanity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's my father in law was a smoke,</v>

603
00:29:06.030 --> 00:29:06.970
<v Speaker 2>told you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>delivered me,</v>

604
00:29:06.971 --> 00:29:07.804
<v Speaker 2>and he was a surgeon.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He used to talk about how he would </v>

605
00:29:10.110 --> 00:29:10.943
<v Speaker 2>relieve stress in the our by cracking </v>
<v Speaker 2>jokes and I've always thought that the </v>

606
00:29:16.201 --> 00:29:17.034
<v Speaker 2>best way to manage people in a time of </v>
<v Speaker 2>stress is to remind them of their </v>

607
00:29:20.701 --> 00:29:22.980
<v Speaker 2>humanity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Make them laugh,</v>

608
00:29:23.250 --> 00:29:24.083
<v Speaker 2>and if they can laugh for five seconds,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that gets the endorphins running and </v>

609
00:29:27.571 --> 00:29:30.060
<v Speaker 2>they can go out and keep working 24 </v>
<v Speaker 2>hours a day,</v>

610
00:29:30.061 --> 00:29:33.150
<v Speaker 2>seven days a week.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I was criticized for joking.</v>

611
00:29:33.270 --> 00:29:34.103
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know about school because I've been </v>

612
00:29:35.251 --> 00:29:36.120
<v Speaker 2>asked before.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

613
00:29:36.121 --> 00:29:38.340
<v Speaker 2>would you take any of those emails back?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not on one of them,</v>

614
00:29:38.880 --> 00:29:39.713
<v Speaker 2>because you know what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that made a staffer smile that made </v>

615
00:29:41.531 --> 00:29:42.364
<v Speaker 2>somebody laugh and if you don't </v>
<v Speaker 2>understand the context within which it </v>

616
00:29:46.451 --> 00:29:49.720
<v Speaker 2>was made,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then you are deliberately just trying to</v>

617
00:29:49.721 --> 00:29:51.190
<v Speaker 2>make hay out of something.</v>

618
00:29:51.340 --> 00:29:52.173
<v Speaker 3>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so let's get back to that 10 seconds of </v>

619
00:29:53.891 --> 00:29:55.600
<v Speaker 3>video.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Know the exact line.</v>

620
00:29:55.601 --> 00:29:57.220
<v Speaker 3>Even though everyone says it's a heck of</v>
<v Speaker 3>a job,</v>

621
00:29:58.090 --> 00:30:00.130
<v Speaker 3>they don't even get that right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He actually said,</v>

622
00:30:00.370 --> 00:30:02.260
<v Speaker 3>Brownie,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're doing a heck of A.</v>

623
00:30:03.350 --> 00:30:04.183
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just want to clean that up for him </v>

624
00:30:04.920 --> 00:30:06.550
<v Speaker 3>because even that line,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they don't get it.</v>

625
00:30:06.560 --> 00:30:07.001
<v Speaker 3>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

626
00:30:07.001 --> 00:30:07.834
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How many days into the hurricane was </v>

627
00:30:10.151 --> 00:30:10.450
<v Speaker 3>that?</v>

628
00:30:10.450 --> 00:30:12.490
<v Speaker 2>Oh Gosh.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want to say it was maybe four,</v>

629
00:30:12.491 --> 00:30:13.750
<v Speaker 2>maybe five days.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've kind of,</v>

630
00:30:13.860 --> 00:30:15.730
<v Speaker 2>I conflate time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but four or five years.</v>

631
00:30:15.760 --> 00:30:17.140
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so four or five days.</v>

632
00:30:17.141 --> 00:30:17.974
<v Speaker 3>You know what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now I watched plenty of other video </v>

633
00:30:19.930 --> 00:30:23.890
<v Speaker 3>today of what you were doing at the time</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you're standing there.</v>

634
00:30:24.010 --> 00:30:27.040
<v Speaker 3>People can see this on youtube.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're standing there with giant maps of</v>

635
00:30:27.041 --> 00:30:27.874
<v Speaker 3>the whole area.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was very clear to me at least </v>

636
00:30:29.500 --> 00:30:33.250
<v Speaker 3>watching it now that you had total </v>
<v Speaker 3>command of where things were and who was</v>

637
00:30:33.251 --> 00:30:34.280
<v Speaker 3>supposed to be,</v>
<v Speaker 3>where,</v>

638
00:30:34.480 --> 00:30:37.590
<v Speaker 3>where water was going to hit harder.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>

639
00:30:37.990 --> 00:30:38.910
<v Speaker 3>Bush,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

640
00:30:38.950 --> 00:30:39.783
<v Speaker 3>to his credit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he,</v>

641
00:30:39.790 --> 00:30:43.360
<v Speaker 3>it seemed that he was listening along </v>
<v Speaker 3>with us and you know,</v>

642
00:30:43.450 --> 00:30:45.070
<v Speaker 3>doing the best job I think that he </v>
<v Speaker 3>could,</v>

643
00:30:46.120 --> 00:30:47.830
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>after.</v>

644
00:30:48.130 --> 00:30:50.560
<v Speaker 3>Was it a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>was it three minutes after he says that,</v>

645
00:30:50.561 --> 00:30:53.110
<v Speaker 3>that you realized there that the media </v>
<v Speaker 3>went crazy with it?</v>

646
00:30:53.130 --> 00:30:54.150
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was the minute he was,</v>

647
00:30:54.220 --> 00:30:57.790
<v Speaker 2>the minute he said it because here's </v>
<v Speaker 2>what you don't know what you,</v>

648
00:30:57.850 --> 00:30:58.683
<v Speaker 2>what most people don't know is that I </v>
<v Speaker 2>had told the I called Air Force One and </v>

649
00:31:03.941 --> 00:31:04.774
<v Speaker 2>said when he lands and gets here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I need five minutes before we do any </v>

650
00:31:09.281 --> 00:31:14.281
<v Speaker 2>sort of public photo op.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And when you,</v>

651
00:31:15.610 --> 00:31:16.443
<v Speaker 2>even at my level to the under secretary,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even when you say I gotTa have five </v>

652
00:31:19.061 --> 00:31:21.250
<v Speaker 2>minutes with the president,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they still want to know why.</v>

653
00:31:21.620 --> 00:31:24.670
<v Speaker 2>And I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because he's got to understand before he</v>

654
00:31:24.671 --> 00:31:25.504
<v Speaker 2>walks in front of cameras,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how bad things are in New Orleans </v>

655
00:31:27.760 --> 00:31:30.460
<v Speaker 2>because we're gonna leave that Air </v>
<v Speaker 2>National Guard base,</v>

656
00:31:30.700 --> 00:31:31.533
<v Speaker 2>get on marine one and we're going to fly</v>
<v Speaker 2>to New Orleans and he's going to start </v>

657
00:31:34.871 --> 00:31:35.704
<v Speaker 2>seeing how screwed up it is in New </v>
<v Speaker 2>Orleans and I want to make sure he </v>

658
00:31:39.521 --> 00:31:43.510
<v Speaker 2>understands that before he gets there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So sure.</v>

659
00:31:43.511 --> 00:31:44.470
<v Speaker 2>We got plenty of time.</v>

660
00:31:44.530 --> 00:31:45.363
<v Speaker 2>So we walk into the green room.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm just starting to talk to the </v>

661
00:31:48.341 --> 00:31:52.000
<v Speaker 2>president and they come in and say we </v>
<v Speaker 2>gotta get moving presses out here.</v>

662
00:31:52.001 --> 00:31:52.834
<v Speaker 2>We're already running late and they pull</v>
<v Speaker 2>him out and I don't have time to brief </v>

663
00:31:55.031 --> 00:31:57.190
<v Speaker 2>him or how bad it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the moment.</v>

664
00:31:57.340 --> 00:31:59.260
<v Speaker 2>And here's what really happened.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bob Riley,</v>

665
00:31:59.261 --> 00:32:01.270
<v Speaker 2>who was the governor of Alabama,</v>
<v Speaker 2>former congressman,</v>

666
00:32:01.570 --> 00:32:04.050
<v Speaker 2>good friend of mine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we were doing great male,</v>

667
00:32:04.051 --> 00:32:06.130
<v Speaker 2>a Bama thing for perfect and Alabama </v>
<v Speaker 2>perfect.</v>

668
00:32:06.131 --> 00:32:09.580
<v Speaker 2>Things were very good in Mississippi.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was just Louisiana.</v>

669
00:32:10.600 --> 00:32:14.320
<v Speaker 2>So Bob Riley being the supportive guy </v>
<v Speaker 2>that he is said,</v>

670
00:32:14.380 --> 00:32:14.831
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>by the way,</v>

671
00:32:14.831 --> 00:32:16.680
<v Speaker 2>Mr President,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just want you to know that the team is</v>

672
00:32:16.681 --> 00:32:20.170
<v Speaker 2>doing a great job in Alabama.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's when the president said,</v>

673
00:32:20.650 --> 00:32:22.210
<v Speaker 2>boom,</v>
<v Speaker 2>slap me in the gut.</v>

674
00:32:22.570 --> 00:32:24.010
<v Speaker 2>And it was that moment,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dave,</v>

675
00:32:24.011 --> 00:32:25.780
<v Speaker 2>that I knew.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God,</v>

676
00:32:26.500 --> 00:32:27.333
<v Speaker 2>now three things have happened.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The press knows that I've got a </v>

677
00:32:31.241 --> 00:32:33.760
<v Speaker 2>relationship with the president that I </v>
<v Speaker 2>have a nickname.</v>

678
00:32:34.150 --> 00:32:37.420
<v Speaker 2>So I'm one of the few people in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>inner circle that has a nickname,</v>

679
00:32:38.270 --> 00:32:39.470
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to the press,</v>

680
00:32:39.471 --> 00:32:44.471
<v Speaker 2>knows how bad things are in New Orleans.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And now both me and the boss looked like</v>

681
00:32:45.321 --> 00:32:48.590
<v Speaker 2>we're totally out of touch about what's </v>
<v Speaker 2>happening down in the Gulf.</v>

682
00:32:49.460 --> 00:32:50.080
<v Speaker 3>God,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

683
00:32:50.080 --> 00:32:54.000
<v Speaker 3>there's so much there when you really </v>
<v Speaker 3>realize how this was happening,</v>

684
00:32:54.310 --> 00:32:55.143
<v Speaker 3>I was,</v>

685
00:32:55.190 --> 00:32:59.900
<v Speaker 2>if you watch that closely,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you'll see me grimace because I was just</v>

686
00:32:59.901 --> 00:33:01.430
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>holy.</v>

687
00:33:02.240 --> 00:33:03.073
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

688
00:33:03.120 --> 00:33:05.160
<v Speaker 3>So okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So once that happened,</v>

689
00:33:05.220 --> 00:33:10.080
<v Speaker 3>how much of what your job became was </v>
<v Speaker 3>just dealing with media craziness,</v>

690
00:33:10.190 --> 00:33:11.660
<v Speaker 2>total,</v>
<v Speaker 2>total.</v>

691
00:33:12.590 --> 00:33:13.423
<v Speaker 2>Not just the media,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but now with a secretary of Homeland </v>

692
00:33:17.390 --> 00:33:18.740
<v Speaker 2>Security,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Michael Chertoff,</v>

693
00:33:19.130 --> 00:33:23.750
<v Speaker 2>who have never done any sort of </v>
<v Speaker 2>operations in his life.</v>

694
00:33:23.751 --> 00:33:24.584
<v Speaker 2>He was an appellate court judge and </v>
<v Speaker 2>appellate court judge has clerks that </v>

695
00:33:27.411 --> 00:33:28.244
<v Speaker 2>bring your briefs and say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here's what we think your decisions </v>

696
00:33:29.561 --> 00:33:30.770
<v Speaker 2>should be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You sit behind the desk,</v>

697
00:33:30.800 --> 00:33:31.633
<v Speaker 2>you take your time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't realize that if you put off a </v>

698
00:33:33.681 --> 00:33:36.770
<v Speaker 2>decision for 30 minutes in the middle of</v>
<v Speaker 2>a disaster,</v>

699
00:33:37.040 --> 00:33:40.580
<v Speaker 2>that translates to three hours and that </v>
<v Speaker 2>costs lives.</v>

700
00:33:40.730 --> 00:33:44.810
<v Speaker 2>So now I'm dealing with a Boston DC that</v>
<v Speaker 2>doesn't have a clue what he's doing,</v>

701
00:33:45.110 --> 00:33:50.110
<v Speaker 2>who's mad at me because I'm on a Gulf </v>
<v Speaker 2>stream trying to get from mobile to Gulf</v>

702
00:33:50.331 --> 00:33:51.164
<v Speaker 2>port to Baton Rouge,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to New Orleans and trying to keep my </v>

703
00:33:53.781 --> 00:33:56.510
<v Speaker 2>fingers on everything going on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Who tells me,</v>

704
00:33:56.960 --> 00:33:59.460
<v Speaker 2>I'm tired of you flying around because I</v>
<v Speaker 2>can't find you and I'm thinking,</v>

705
00:33:59.461 --> 00:34:01.940
<v Speaker 2>you can't find me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm on a government.</v>

706
00:34:01.941 --> 00:34:04.820
<v Speaker 2>Gulf stream has got satellite.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can find me anywhere in the world if</v>

707
00:34:04.821 --> 00:34:05.654
<v Speaker 2>you want to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So tells me to plant my button in baton </v>

708
00:34:08.751 --> 00:34:11.240
<v Speaker 2>rouge.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I turned to my staff and say,</v>

709
00:34:11.510 --> 00:34:13.510
<v Speaker 2>this is the beginning of the end </v>
<v Speaker 2>thereafter.</v>

710
00:34:13.580 --> 00:34:15.290
<v Speaker 2>Me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the media is after me,</v>

711
00:34:15.980 --> 00:34:18.380
<v Speaker 2>Chertoff's after me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're looking for a scapegoat.</v>

712
00:34:19.010 --> 00:34:20.930
<v Speaker 2>I'm not that stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I know what's going on.</v>

713
00:34:20.990 --> 00:34:22.020
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Are.</v>

714
00:34:22.150 --> 00:34:26.330
<v Speaker 3>Are there any points of criticism during</v>
<v Speaker 3>that time that you think are.</v>

715
00:34:26.650 --> 00:34:27.483
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yes,</v>

716
00:34:27.630 --> 00:34:32.630
<v Speaker 2>yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have a friend who is a psychiatrist at</v>

717
00:34:32.641 --> 00:34:36.450
<v Speaker 2>the Kennedy School of government and the</v>
<v Speaker 2>school public health.</v>

718
00:34:37.200 --> 00:34:38.033
<v Speaker 2>And I asked him one time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I said there was a point during Katrina </v>

719
00:34:41.761 --> 00:34:45.270
<v Speaker 2>where you haven't known me but a few </v>
<v Speaker 2>minutes now,</v>

720
00:34:45.271 --> 00:34:48.240
<v Speaker 2>but I think you can tell I'm a pretty </v>
<v Speaker 2>type a person person.</v>

721
00:34:48.690 --> 00:34:51.270
<v Speaker 2>Pretty energetic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm pretty engaged in whatever I do.</v>

722
00:34:51.271 --> 00:34:54.330
<v Speaker 2>I'm passionate about what I do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I asked my buddy,</v>

723
00:34:54.331 --> 00:34:59.070
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I know that there was a point where I</v>

724
00:34:59.071 --> 00:34:59.904
<v Speaker 2>was just frozen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I literally could not make a decision </v>

725
00:35:03.750 --> 00:35:05.550
<v Speaker 2>what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What happens?</v>

726
00:35:06.030 --> 00:35:08.780
<v Speaker 2>He drew me a cartoon and it's a car,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

727
00:35:09.260 --> 00:35:11.160
<v Speaker 2>the great wizard of Oz.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

728
00:35:11.161 --> 00:35:15.060
<v Speaker 2>it's a picture of me in the first panel </v>
<v Speaker 2>pushing all these buttons and levers and</v>

729
00:35:15.120 --> 00:35:18.390
<v Speaker 2>turning wheels and stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And in the second panel,</v>

730
00:35:18.391 --> 00:35:23.391
<v Speaker 2>I'm staring at that same group of </v>
<v Speaker 2>buttons like what's going on.</v>

731
00:35:24.420 --> 00:35:25.253
<v Speaker 2>And in the third panel I've gone around </v>
<v Speaker 2>look behind and over wires have been </v>

732
00:35:28.641 --> 00:35:32.460
<v Speaker 2>cut.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he says that physiologically,</v>

733
00:35:33.240 --> 00:35:34.440
<v Speaker 2>whether it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a,</v>

734
00:35:34.590 --> 00:35:35.423
<v Speaker 2>it's ptsd,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a phenomena in the brain that when </v>

735
00:35:39.631 --> 00:35:41.370
<v Speaker 2>we are trained,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like if I,</v>

736
00:35:41.371 --> 00:35:45.120
<v Speaker 2>if I have trained myself,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that when I tell my staff,</v>

737
00:35:45.330 --> 00:35:47.850
<v Speaker 2>do x,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I expect x to happen.</v>

738
00:35:48.420 --> 00:35:51.330
<v Speaker 2>When you and I turned on these lights or</v>
<v Speaker 2>flip a switch,</v>

739
00:35:51.360 --> 00:35:56.360
<v Speaker 2>we expect the lights to come on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now you add all the physical stress,</v>

740
00:35:56.820 --> 00:35:59.970
<v Speaker 2>the emotional stress and nothing is </v>
<v Speaker 2>working.</v>

741
00:36:00.270 --> 00:36:03.420
<v Speaker 2>The brain starts to shut down and I will</v>
<v Speaker 2>freely admit.</v>

742
00:36:03.860 --> 00:36:06.870
<v Speaker 2>And this is why I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I to this day,</v>

743
00:36:06.871 --> 00:36:10.470
<v Speaker 2>I saw a firefighter the other day on the</v>
<v Speaker 2>street was having lunch.</v>

744
00:36:11.010 --> 00:36:12.930
<v Speaker 2>And I walked up to him and I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what are you doing?</v>

745
00:36:13.710 --> 00:36:15.510
<v Speaker 2>We've been doing training and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and uh,</v>

746
00:36:15.690 --> 00:36:17.040
<v Speaker 2>I'm taking the guys out for lunch.</v>

747
00:36:17.430 --> 00:36:18.121
<v Speaker 2>And I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

748
00:36:18.121 --> 00:36:20.370
<v Speaker 2>you don't know who I am,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but let me just tell you that,</v>

749
00:36:20.371 --> 00:36:21.330
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

750
00:36:21.331 --> 00:36:24.000
<v Speaker 2>making sure those guys have time off and</v>
<v Speaker 2>that they get rest.</v>

751
00:36:24.300 --> 00:36:25.133
<v Speaker 2>That's the most important thing you can </v>
<v Speaker 2>do because if they don't get rest when </v>

752
00:36:28.321 --> 00:36:29.154
<v Speaker 2>they're fighting the fires,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they themselves can become victims of </v>

753
00:36:32.671 --> 00:36:36.300
<v Speaker 2>that disaster.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we've got to learn to train ourselves</v>

754
00:36:36.600 --> 00:36:39.060
<v Speaker 2>that when we're under that kind of </v>
<v Speaker 2>stress,</v>

755
00:36:39.330 --> 00:36:40.163
<v Speaker 2>you have to be able to step back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And this is what I speak about </v>

756
00:36:42.811 --> 00:36:43.644
<v Speaker 2>resilience.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've learned to try to teach audiences </v>

757
00:36:46.470 --> 00:36:47.303
<v Speaker 2>that we all have a network and what we </v>
<v Speaker 2>have to do is learn that when we find </v>

758
00:36:52.021 --> 00:36:56.190
<v Speaker 2>ourselves in those moments that were </v>
<v Speaker 2>either not making the right decisions or</v>

759
00:36:56.191 --> 00:36:57.024
<v Speaker 2>we're not making decisions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we need some external force to come in </v>

760
00:37:00.540 --> 00:37:03.660
<v Speaker 2>and kind of slapped some sense into us </v>
<v Speaker 2>and say,</v>

761
00:37:04.110 --> 00:37:05.220
<v Speaker 2>change your perspective.</v>

762
00:37:05.460 --> 00:37:10.260
<v Speaker 2>What I see is this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If somebody has helped me do that during</v>

763
00:37:10.261 --> 00:37:11.094
<v Speaker 2>Katrina,</v>
<v Speaker 2>might've still had the presidential bus </v>

764
00:37:13.681 --> 00:37:14.514
<v Speaker 2>run me over,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but at least I would have known why and </v>

765
00:37:16.411 --> 00:37:17.244
<v Speaker 2>what was happening.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But is that almost counter to the way a </v>

766
00:37:20.071 --> 00:37:23.240
<v Speaker 2>sort of big government has to operate </v>
<v Speaker 2>you course it is.</v>

767
00:37:23.690 --> 00:37:26.130
<v Speaker 2>You can't assume people are running </v>
<v Speaker 2>around smacking people and trying to get</v>

768
00:37:26.131 --> 00:37:28.440
<v Speaker 2>him to wake up because the machine is so</v>
<v Speaker 2>stiff,</v>

769
00:37:29.030 --> 00:37:31.220
<v Speaker 2>but what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I needed a and you could.</v>

770
00:37:31.680 --> 00:37:34.170
<v Speaker 2>My very best friend and my lawyer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Andy Lester,</v>

771
00:37:34.260 --> 00:37:38.220
<v Speaker 2>who went through all the congressional </v>
<v Speaker 2>hearings with me to this day,</v>

772
00:37:38.221 --> 00:37:39.054
<v Speaker 2>he'll tell you that he regrets not </v>
<v Speaker 2>getting in his car and driving to baton </v>

773
00:37:41.551 --> 00:37:42.384
<v Speaker 2>rouge because he's watching this from a </v>
<v Speaker 2>distance and he's seeing what's </v>

774
00:37:44.971 --> 00:37:47.430
<v Speaker 2>happening and he knows me well enough </v>
<v Speaker 2>that he.</v>

775
00:37:47.550 --> 00:37:52.550
<v Speaker 2>He could tell that I'm just frozen like </v>
<v Speaker 2>nothing's working,</v>

776
00:37:54.030 --> 00:37:55.080
<v Speaker 2>what do I do next?</v>

777
00:37:55.530 --> 00:37:58.260
<v Speaker 2>And I just needed that external force to</v>
<v Speaker 2>come in and say,</v>

778
00:37:58.500 --> 00:37:59.790
<v Speaker 2>you're right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>nothing's working.</v>

779
00:37:59.820 --> 00:38:01.860
<v Speaker 2>Here's why.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's take inventory.</v>

780
00:38:02.010 --> 00:38:03.570
<v Speaker 2>Have you slept?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

781
00:38:03.571 --> 00:38:04.404
<v Speaker 2>I haven't slept for three days.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe you ought to go try to take an </v>

782
00:38:06.931 --> 00:38:08.670
<v Speaker 2>ambien.</v>
<v Speaker 2>At least get four hours of sleep.</v>

783
00:38:09.090 --> 00:38:11.490
<v Speaker 2>It's that kind of stuff that makes a </v>
<v Speaker 2>huge event at that point.</v>

784
00:38:11.550 --> 00:38:13.440
<v Speaker 2>Also with what was happening because of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the media.</v>

785
00:38:13.441 --> 00:38:14.274
<v Speaker 2>You were sorta just in a feeding frenzy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was like a self fulfilling self </v>

786
00:38:18.090 --> 00:38:18.880
<v Speaker 2>fulfilling,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

787
00:38:18.880 --> 00:38:20.890
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to this day I,</v>

788
00:38:20.920 --> 00:38:22.710
<v Speaker 2>I'm always amazed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I could,</v>

789
00:38:22.800 --> 00:38:24.600
<v Speaker 2>I could go through the litany of false </v>
<v Speaker 2>hoods,</v>

790
00:38:24.940 --> 00:38:29.220
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that I no longer defensive about because</v>

791
00:38:29.570 --> 00:38:30.403
<v Speaker 2>they're false hoods and it is what it is</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I love talking about them in front </v>

792
00:38:33.901 --> 00:38:34.734
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

793
00:38:34.810 --> 00:38:36.010
<v Speaker 2>corporate ceos and</v>

794
00:38:36.010 --> 00:38:38.620
<v Speaker 3>Titans of industry who think they know </v>
<v Speaker 3>that they can run everything.</v>

795
00:38:38.770 --> 00:38:39.603
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let me tell you,</v>

796
00:38:39.640 --> 00:38:40.473
<v Speaker 3>someday the preferred,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the proverbial theses is going to hit </v>

797
00:38:42.761 --> 00:38:45.910
<v Speaker 3>the fan and your company and you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>going to want to learn these lessons and</v>

798
00:38:45.911 --> 00:38:46.540
<v Speaker 3>learn them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well.</v>

799
00:38:46.540 --> 00:38:51.540
<v Speaker 3>That's why I run a small business here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We have very little management.</v>

800
00:38:51.770 --> 00:38:55.090
<v Speaker 3>Very good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What do you make of just sort of the.</v>

801
00:38:55.150 --> 00:38:57.070
<v Speaker 3>I guess this is just part of the human </v>
<v Speaker 3>condition,</v>

802
00:38:57.700 --> 00:39:00.670
<v Speaker 3>the idea that we always need someone to </v>
<v Speaker 3>blame.</v>

803
00:39:00.700 --> 00:39:03.550
<v Speaker 3>Now you are acknowledging that not </v>
<v Speaker 3>everything went right.</v>

804
00:39:03.660 --> 00:39:04.493
<v Speaker 3>You didn't make every right decision.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're acknowledging government over a </v>

805
00:39:07.420 --> 00:39:08.253
<v Speaker 3>nonsense and all that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but just this need to blame because I </v>

806
00:39:11.561 --> 00:39:14.670
<v Speaker 3>think you are one of the first examples </v>
<v Speaker 3>because maybe it was sort of at the,</v>

807
00:39:14.680 --> 00:39:18.940
<v Speaker 3>just at the beginnings of social media </v>
<v Speaker 3>or lines of just like,</v>

808
00:39:18.970 --> 00:39:21.400
<v Speaker 3>let's just take this guy and we didn't </v>
<v Speaker 3>know who he was.</v>

809
00:39:21.400 --> 00:39:24.120
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and less just destroy it.</v>

810
00:39:24.130 --> 00:39:27.400
<v Speaker 3>Let's just will destroy his career and </v>
<v Speaker 3>then we'll try to destroy his life.</v>

811
00:39:27.690 --> 00:39:28.523
<v Speaker 3>What are you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what do you make of just that general </v>

812
00:39:29.471 --> 00:39:30.790
<v Speaker 3>psychological?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

813
00:39:31.330 --> 00:39:32.440
<v Speaker 3>there is a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

814
00:39:32.710 --> 00:39:35.170
<v Speaker 3>there's two ways to look at it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>In Judaism,</v>

815
00:39:35.230 --> 00:39:36.063
<v Speaker 3>there is the philosophy of finding the </v>
<v Speaker 3>scape goat and putting all the sins of </v>

816
00:39:40.571 --> 00:39:41.404
<v Speaker 3>the community,</v>
<v Speaker 3>putting all the sins of the village and </v>

817
00:39:42.490 --> 00:39:44.560
<v Speaker 3>escape.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let me go and throwing the gold over the</v>

818
00:39:44.561 --> 00:39:45.790
<v Speaker 3>cliff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

819
00:39:45.791 --> 00:39:46.624
<v Speaker 3>I think that really is applicable to </v>
<v Speaker 3>life in general and we have through </v>

820
00:39:49.721 --> 00:39:50.830
<v Speaker 3>social media.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can't,</v>

821
00:39:50.860 --> 00:39:53.710
<v Speaker 3>I can't even imagine what it would have </v>
<v Speaker 3>been like with social media</v>

822
00:39:54.010 --> 00:39:58.090
<v Speaker 2>back in 2005.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was brutal enough without it.</v>

823
00:39:58.420 --> 00:39:59.253
<v Speaker 2>But I think we have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you think about the hierarchy of </v>

824
00:40:03.131 --> 00:40:06.580
<v Speaker 2>needs that people have belonged,</v>
<v Speaker 2>love,</v>

825
00:40:06.670 --> 00:40:07.503
<v Speaker 2>power,</v>
<v Speaker 2>social media has amplified all of those </v>

826
00:40:10.600 --> 00:40:11.433
<v Speaker 2>and the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the feeling of being superior to </v>

827
00:40:14.621 --> 00:40:15.454
<v Speaker 2>somebody else so permeates our society </v>
<v Speaker 2>that any chance we have to squish </v>

828
00:40:20.291 --> 00:40:21.730
<v Speaker 2>somebody,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it makes.</v>

829
00:40:21.940 --> 00:40:24.090
<v Speaker 2>I don't know whether it's an endorphin </v>
<v Speaker 2>rush,</v>

830
00:40:24.110 --> 00:40:24.943
<v Speaker 2>adrenaline,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but something that we now have this </v>

831
00:40:26.680 --> 00:40:30.130
<v Speaker 2>horrible,</v>
<v Speaker 2>horrible desire to just destroy people.</v>

832
00:40:30.700 --> 00:40:32.890
<v Speaker 2>They have lives.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They have families now.</v>

833
00:40:32.891 --> 00:40:35.290
<v Speaker 2>Some people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe they deserve it.</v>

834
00:40:35.291 --> 00:40:36.800
<v Speaker 2>Maybe they don't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I,</v>

835
00:40:36.850 --> 00:40:41.140
<v Speaker 2>I like to think that everybody,</v>
<v Speaker 2>unless you just totally a doofus,</v>

836
00:40:41.680 --> 00:40:43.360
<v Speaker 2>people are actually trying to do the </v>
<v Speaker 2>best I can.</v>

837
00:40:43.830 --> 00:40:45.630
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean I'm a firm believer in that,</v>

838
00:40:45.810 --> 00:40:46.643
<v Speaker 3>but yes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of course there are people that want to </v>

839
00:40:47.971 --> 00:40:49.890
<v Speaker 3>just destroy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Unfortunately,</v>

840
00:40:49.891 --> 00:40:52.740
<v Speaker 3>I think social media has amplified the </v>
<v Speaker 3>best antidote</v>

841
00:40:52.900 --> 00:40:57.900
<v Speaker 2>that heals me because I refused to stay </v>
<v Speaker 2>down.</v>

842
00:40:58.550 --> 00:41:01.880
<v Speaker 2>There were people have actually advised </v>
<v Speaker 2>me you need to slither away.</v>

843
00:41:02.300 --> 00:41:04.330
<v Speaker 2>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>are you kidding me?</v>

844
00:41:04.440 --> 00:41:05.273
<v Speaker 2>I cannot wait for these congressional </v>
<v Speaker 2>hearings because I can't wait for some </v>

845
00:41:09.080 --> 00:41:09.913
<v Speaker 2>dumb ass congressman or dumb ass senator</v>
<v Speaker 2>who thinks that he's God's gift of </v>

846
00:41:12.731 --> 00:41:13.564
<v Speaker 2>creation to ask me a question because </v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to tell him the truth whether </v>

847
00:41:16.371 --> 00:41:17.110
<v Speaker 2>he likes it or not.</v>

848
00:41:17.110 --> 00:41:20.550
<v Speaker 3>So let's talk about this hearing's a </v>
<v Speaker 3>little bit when you see it.</v>

849
00:41:20.560 --> 00:41:24.120
<v Speaker 3>Just not hearing right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Any hearing related to anything else.</v>

850
00:41:24.520 --> 00:41:29.520
<v Speaker 3>It strikes me as patently obvious that </v>
<v Speaker 3>pretty much the senators and congressmen</v>

851
00:41:30.101 --> 00:41:32.740
<v Speaker 3>have almost no idea what they're talking</v>
<v Speaker 3>about really,</v>

852
00:41:33.140 --> 00:41:36.620
<v Speaker 3>but they've been handed a brief and </v>
<v Speaker 3>they've been told by Prob,</v>

853
00:41:36.640 --> 00:41:38.660
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a handler or whoever.</v>

854
00:41:38.780 --> 00:41:39.613
<v Speaker 3>These are the three questions you got </v>
<v Speaker 3>asked cause we gotta get you on CNN </v>

855
00:41:41.451 --> 00:41:43.360
<v Speaker 3>tonight so then you can push this and </v>
<v Speaker 3>blah blah.</v>

856
00:41:44.200 --> 00:41:48.110
<v Speaker 3>Just did the hearings when they're </v>
<v Speaker 3>trying to unpackage all of this.</v>

857
00:41:48.111 --> 00:41:51.260
<v Speaker 3>Did hearings ever make things better at </v>
<v Speaker 3>the end?</v>

858
00:41:51.261 --> 00:41:53.390
<v Speaker 3>Like is there a hearing that ends and </v>
<v Speaker 3>then they go,</v>

859
00:41:53.660 --> 00:41:57.110
<v Speaker 3>we really solved the problems of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of why Katrina happened,</v>

860
00:41:57.111 --> 00:42:00.120
<v Speaker 3>why the levees failed,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what the problems were with fema or were</v>

861
00:42:00.121 --> 00:42:01.610
<v Speaker 3>there other responders,</v>
<v Speaker 3>etc.</v>

862
00:42:01.611 --> 00:42:02.570
<v Speaker 3>Etc.</v>
<v Speaker 3>RarEly,</v>

863
00:42:03.240 --> 00:42:03.991
<v Speaker 2>in fact,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let me tell you,</v>

864
00:42:03.991 --> 00:42:06.720
<v Speaker 2>it's actually worse than what you think.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just more government growing.</v>

865
00:42:07.100 --> 00:42:07.933
<v Speaker 2>It's moRe government growing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But to tell you how bad it really is </v>

866
00:42:11.300 --> 00:42:13.850
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If as the under secretary,</v>

867
00:42:13.860 --> 00:42:16.930
<v Speaker 2>if I'm going to testify now as a private</v>
<v Speaker 2>citizen when I testified in,</v>

868
00:42:16.980 --> 00:42:18.270
<v Speaker 2>in the katrina,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the hearings</v>

869
00:42:18.890 --> 00:42:19.500
<v Speaker 3>clear.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So how,</v>

870
00:42:19.500 --> 00:42:24.500
<v Speaker 3>how long after the John Brown eight </v>
<v Speaker 3>until you until you resigned?</v>

871
00:42:25.680 --> 00:42:26.041
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

872
00:42:26.041 --> 00:42:27.780
<v Speaker 2>I actually,</v>
<v Speaker 2>interestingly,</v>

873
00:42:27.781 --> 00:42:32.781
<v Speaker 2>I resigned on September 11th of 2005,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but then they came to me and said,</v>

874
00:42:34.260 --> 00:42:35.093
<v Speaker 2>oh we need you to stay on because we've </v>
<v Speaker 2>got to figure out just what's going on </v>

875
00:42:39.751 --> 00:42:42.030
<v Speaker 2>because they're going to come after the </v>
<v Speaker 2>administration.</v>

876
00:42:42.480 --> 00:42:43.313
<v Speaker 2>So we went to cow,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we want to keep you in the fold for </v>

877
00:42:45.481 --> 00:42:46.314
<v Speaker 2>awhile.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they kept me on as a consultant for </v>

878
00:42:48.650 --> 00:42:49.483
<v Speaker 2>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want to say four or five months </v>

879
00:42:50.551 --> 00:42:52.510
<v Speaker 2>afterwards.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then I pulled the.</v>

880
00:42:52.511 --> 00:42:53.344
<v Speaker 2>You must have been seriously pissed at </v>
<v Speaker 2>that because now you knew you were just </v>

881
00:42:55.261 --> 00:42:57.570
<v Speaker 2>saying yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I pulled the trigger and said no more</v>

882
00:42:57.571 --> 00:42:58.404
<v Speaker 2>consulting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm a private citizen and so when I'm </v>

883
00:43:00.541 --> 00:43:01.374
<v Speaker 2>called to testify,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the white house has to do one of two </v>

884
00:43:03.691 --> 00:43:04.524
<v Speaker 2>things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They have to either accept that I'm </v>

885
00:43:05.761 --> 00:43:06.594
<v Speaker 2>going to tell the truth or they have to </v>
<v Speaker 2>invoke executive privilege and prevent </v>

886
00:43:09.541 --> 00:43:10.374
<v Speaker 2>me from testifying and we deliberately </v>
<v Speaker 2>settled up with Susan Collins and joe </v>

887
00:43:14.341 --> 00:43:18.060
<v Speaker 2>lieberman for senator lieberman to ask </v>
<v Speaker 2>me a question,</v>

888
00:43:18.680 --> 00:43:19.513
<v Speaker 2>so about conversations with the </v>
<v Speaker 2>president or the white house so that </v>

889
00:43:23.790 --> 00:43:27.270
<v Speaker 2>when that question was asked,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my lawyer could say,</v>

890
00:43:28.290 --> 00:43:32.100
<v Speaker 2>my client wants to answer the question,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he cannot.</v>

891
00:43:32.190 --> 00:43:35.100
<v Speaker 2>If the white house is going to invoke </v>
<v Speaker 2>executive privilege,</v>

892
00:43:35.520 --> 00:43:39.000
<v Speaker 2>which then allowed senator lieberman see</v>
<v Speaker 2>how the charade works,</v>

893
00:43:39.390 --> 00:43:40.223
<v Speaker 2>then allow senator lieberman to ask,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is there anyone in this hearing room </v>

894
00:43:43.770 --> 00:43:47.370
<v Speaker 2>from the white house who wants to invoke</v>
<v Speaker 2>executive privilege?</v>

895
00:43:47.850 --> 00:43:52.850
<v Speaker 2>And of course the room silent and </v>
<v Speaker 2>senator lieberman laughed and said,</v>

896
00:43:54.150 --> 00:43:55.650
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure there are plenty of people from</v>

897
00:43:55.651 --> 00:43:56.484
<v Speaker 2>the white house here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but apparently nobody wants to invoke </v>

898
00:43:58.351 --> 00:44:00.210
<v Speaker 2>executive privilege.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Mr.</v>

899
00:44:00.210 --> 00:44:03.270
<v Speaker 2>Brown answer the questIon and boom,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we were off to the races,</v>

900
00:44:03.750 --> 00:44:05.550
<v Speaker 2>but to go back about just a regular </v>
<v Speaker 2>hearing.</v>

901
00:44:05.610 --> 00:44:06.443
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If an under secretary or any other </v>

902
00:44:08.281 --> 00:44:10.320
<v Speaker 2>government official is going to go </v>
<v Speaker 2>testify,</v>

903
00:44:10.590 --> 00:44:13.920
<v Speaker 2>his testimony is cleared through the </v>
<v Speaker 2>office of management and budget.</v>

904
00:44:14.460 --> 00:44:19.170
<v Speaker 2>That testimony is given to the senators </v>
<v Speaker 2>and congressmen in advance.</v>

905
00:44:19.620 --> 00:44:22.530
<v Speaker 2>The questions are given to the witness </v>
<v Speaker 2>in advance.</v>

906
00:44:22.830 --> 00:44:25.140
<v Speaker 2>It is a show.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is a production.</v>

907
00:44:26.050 --> 00:44:26.883
<v Speaker 3>How much of it also is that they're </v>
<v Speaker 3>asking you things as if everything sort </v>

908
00:44:30.401 --> 00:44:32.850
<v Speaker 3>of works perfectly in any of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>hearings.</v>

909
00:44:32.851 --> 00:44:33.684
<v Speaker 3>You know when hillary,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the benghazi hearings where they're </v>

910
00:44:35.431 --> 00:44:38.160
<v Speaker 3>asking minute by minute,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what did you say then to this person,</v>

911
00:44:38.161 --> 00:44:39.070
<v Speaker 3>that person.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

912
00:44:39.080 --> 00:44:42.990
<v Speaker 3>I know in my own daily life you asked me</v>
<v Speaker 3>what happened three days ago at noon,</v>

913
00:44:42.991 --> 00:44:43.550
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

914
00:44:43.550 --> 00:44:44.383
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

915
00:44:45.380 --> 00:44:47.050
<v Speaker 3>I'd have to think about it for awhile,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but may I?</v>

916
00:44:47.051 --> 00:44:50.250
<v Speaker 3>Maybe I can come up with it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but just that they.</v>

917
00:44:50.330 --> 00:44:52.030
<v Speaker 3>They're trying to get you on every </v>
<v Speaker 3>little thing.</v>

918
00:44:52.031 --> 00:44:54.460
<v Speaker 3>Plus the pressures of your.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're under oath,</v>

919
00:44:54.500 --> 00:44:56.320
<v Speaker 3>you're the media watching and everything</v>
<v Speaker 3>else.</v>

920
00:44:56.600 --> 00:44:58.600
<v Speaker 3>It just seems like it's a recipe</v>

921
00:44:59.280 --> 00:45:01.080
<v Speaker 2>for nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nothing good,</v>

922
00:45:01.081 --> 00:45:01.914
<v Speaker 2>nothing substantial to come out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nothing substantial does come out of </v>

923
00:45:03.871 --> 00:45:04.704
<v Speaker 2>them now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think there's an exception if if in </v>

924
00:45:07.351 --> 00:45:08.184
<v Speaker 2>the house or senate,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if they are truly conducting and </v>

925
00:45:09.781 --> 00:45:10.614
<v Speaker 2>investigation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and here's how to tell if they're truly </v>

926
00:45:12.631 --> 00:45:13.464
<v Speaker 2>conducting your investigation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they'll depose witnesses outside the </v>

927
00:45:17.461 --> 00:45:18.294
<v Speaker 2>hearing room.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They will ask a witness either </v>

928
00:45:20.251 --> 00:45:21.084
<v Speaker 2>voluntarily or with a subpoena to come </v>
<v Speaker 2>in and subject to a deposition by staff </v>

929
00:45:25.860 --> 00:45:26.693
<v Speaker 2>lawyers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a real investigation that's </v>

930
00:45:28.771 --> 00:45:31.680
<v Speaker 2>really sitting you down and saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>swear to tell the truth,</v>

931
00:45:31.681 --> 00:45:33.000
<v Speaker 2>the whole truth,</v>
<v Speaker 2>nothing but the truth.</v>

932
00:45:33.300 --> 00:45:36.420
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let us ask you a serIes of questions and</v>

933
00:45:37.590 --> 00:45:40.290
<v Speaker 2>that can actually result in something </v>
<v Speaker 2>productive.</v>

934
00:45:40.650 --> 00:45:41.483
<v Speaker 2>Now for the witness,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do you have to be very careful because </v>

935
00:45:43.020 --> 00:45:46.680
<v Speaker 2>like anything else to your point,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why don't you do on wednesday at noon?</v>

936
00:45:47.340 --> 00:45:48.840
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

937
00:45:48.990 --> 00:45:50.420
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I went to uh,</v>

938
00:45:50.630 --> 00:45:52.980
<v Speaker 2>went to this bagel shop down the street </v>
<v Speaker 2>and have lunch.</v>

939
00:45:53.520 --> 00:45:54.480
<v Speaker 2>What was the name of it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

940
00:45:54.481 --> 00:45:55.314
<v Speaker 2>I think it was x.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They find out actually you went to a </v>

941
00:45:58.231 --> 00:46:01.080
<v Speaker 2>burger stand and had a burger.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now they got you in perjury.</v>

942
00:46:01.260 --> 00:46:02.460
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's crazy.</v>

943
00:46:03.210 --> 00:46:06.560
<v Speaker 2>It really is crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what was the resolution and when the,</v>

944
00:46:06.561 --> 00:46:08.440
<v Speaker 2>when the hearings ended,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like what,</v>

945
00:46:08.540 --> 00:46:10.950
<v Speaker 2>what do they do?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So then they issue a report that report,</v>

946
00:46:11.010 --> 00:46:15.060
<v Speaker 2>is there a prior brand and the report,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the report,</v>

947
00:46:15.330 --> 00:46:20.010
<v Speaker 2>I get a kick out of this because the </v>
<v Speaker 2>report virtually acknowledged everything</v>

948
00:46:20.011 --> 00:46:20.844
<v Speaker 2>that I had said was wrong about the </v>
<v Speaker 2>integration of fema and these other </v>

949
00:46:25.261 --> 00:46:26.094
<v Speaker 2>agencies in the dhs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There was a virtual admission to that </v>

950
00:46:29.550 --> 00:46:32.440
<v Speaker 2>then the things that they wanted to do </v>
<v Speaker 2>to correct.</v>

951
00:46:32.441 --> 00:46:33.330
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're,</v>

952
00:46:34.260 --> 00:46:36.780
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to over exaggerate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So let's just say 50 percent.</v>

953
00:46:37.410 --> 00:46:40.830
<v Speaker 2>The nss dropped about 50 percent of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>things that I've been arguing about.</v>

954
00:46:41.190 --> 00:46:43.140
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is it working?</v>

955
00:46:43.590 --> 00:46:46.440
<v Speaker 2>It's not working Because the way things </v>
<v Speaker 2>go in dc,</v>

956
00:46:46.800 --> 00:46:50.660
<v Speaker 2>whoever has the money has the power and </v>
<v Speaker 2>you can't wander.</v>

957
00:46:50.730 --> 00:46:53.700
<v Speaker 2>I'm using the theme of current fema </v>
<v Speaker 2>director who's a former employee of mine</v>

958
00:46:53.701 --> 00:46:57.900
<v Speaker 2>as an example.</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can't expect him on a day to day.</v>

959
00:46:58.020 --> 00:46:59.910
<v Speaker 2>what's his name?</v>
<v Speaker 2>brock brock long.</v>

960
00:46:59.960 --> 00:47:02.100
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Used to be the at the national hurricane</v>

961
00:47:02.101 --> 00:47:04.080
<v Speaker 2>center.</v>
<v Speaker 2>emergency manager in Alabama.</v>

962
00:47:04.320 --> 00:47:05.880
<v Speaker 2>He's a great guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I love this guy.</v>

963
00:47:06.480 --> 00:47:07.313
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>probably shouldn't have said that </v>

964
00:47:08.251 --> 00:47:09.084
<v Speaker 2>because that will know.</v>

965
00:47:09.240 --> 00:47:14.240
<v Speaker 3>Plus they'll regret having said that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's edit that out.</v>

966
00:47:15.630 --> 00:47:19.240
<v Speaker 3>We donate It for you probably made his </v>
<v Speaker 3>Kenya everybody,</v>

967
00:47:19.540 --> 00:47:20.560
<v Speaker 3>right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>exactly.</v>

968
00:47:21.690 --> 00:47:22.450
<v Speaker 2>So we're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're,</v>

969
00:47:22.450 --> 00:47:24.580
<v Speaker 2>we're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

970
00:47:24.880 --> 00:47:29.160
<v Speaker 2>well the reports and the report.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if,</v>

971
00:47:29.790 --> 00:47:30.623
<v Speaker 2>if you're fighting on a day to day basis</v>
<v Speaker 2>for your budget with the secretary of </v>

972
00:47:33.971 --> 00:47:36.220
<v Speaker 2>homeland security and all the other </v>
<v Speaker 2>under secretaries,</v>

973
00:47:36.730 --> 00:47:41.230
<v Speaker 2>and then when a disaster hits,</v>
<v Speaker 2>now you're the boss and the secretary is</v>

974
00:47:41.231 --> 00:47:42.064
<v Speaker 2>subordinate to you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Can you imagine knowing that in the </v>

975
00:47:44.131 --> 00:47:44.964
<v Speaker 2>private sector one day you're the ceo,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but under certain circumstances you as </v>

976
00:47:49.331 --> 00:47:52.390
<v Speaker 2>the ceo or actually subordinate to </v>
<v Speaker 2>somebody else on your staff.</v>

977
00:47:52.660 --> 00:47:53.493
<v Speaker 2>I mean that's an untenable situation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that's kind of the situation they </v>

978
00:47:55.311 --> 00:47:58.000
<v Speaker 2>created with the post katrina act.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's crazy.</v>

979
00:47:58.250 --> 00:47:59.083
<v Speaker 3>So we,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we touched obviously on the media </v>

980
00:48:00.081 --> 00:48:00.914
<v Speaker 3>portion of this and I mentioned how when</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was googling you this morning as I'm </v>

981
00:48:03.051 --> 00:48:03.884
<v Speaker 3>doing research,</v>
<v Speaker 3>half the articles come up are about the </v>

982
00:48:05.541 --> 00:48:08.210
<v Speaker 3>10 year anniversary and they're still </v>
<v Speaker 3>attacking.</v>

983
00:48:08.240 --> 00:48:09.380
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

984
00:48:09.381 --> 00:48:10.214
<v Speaker 3>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have sat here and acknowledge that </v>

985
00:48:11.721 --> 00:48:13.480
<v Speaker 3>you did not do everything perfectly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

986
00:48:13.730 --> 00:48:16.040
<v Speaker 3>But what does,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what do you make of that in a more broad</v>

987
00:48:16.041 --> 00:48:16.874
<v Speaker 3>sense about the media?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because I talk about the media a lot </v>

988
00:48:18.501 --> 00:48:19.334
<v Speaker 3>here and I'm extremely frustrated with </v>
<v Speaker 3>mainstream media and it's almost gotten </v>

989
00:48:21.951 --> 00:48:24.170
<v Speaker 3>to the point where every time they write</v>
<v Speaker 3>something bad about somebody,</v>

990
00:48:24.171 --> 00:48:25.004
<v Speaker 3>I started thinking that they're actually</v>
<v Speaker 3>the good guy because I see the way they </v>

991
00:48:26.971 --> 00:48:31.971
<v Speaker 3>do it to me that the neo really has </v>
<v Speaker 3>completely gotten out of control.</v>

992
00:48:32.060 --> 00:48:33.020
<v Speaker 2>They've.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They've lost,</v>

993
00:48:33.100 --> 00:48:36.110
<v Speaker 2>they've lost all integrity,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they've lost all.</v>

994
00:48:36.150 --> 00:48:36.983
<v Speaker 2>I'm just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is what I do on my own radio </v>

995
00:48:38.391 --> 00:48:39.224
<v Speaker 2>program is I don't tell.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't ever try to tell people what to </v>

996
00:48:42.231 --> 00:48:43.064
<v Speaker 2>think.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I try to give them a different </v>

997
00:48:44.061 --> 00:48:48.110
<v Speaker 2>perspective so that they can,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with their own minds.</v>

998
00:48:48.470 --> 00:48:50.660
<v Speaker 2>Maybe think about something a different </v>
<v Speaker 2>way.</v>

999
00:48:51.150 --> 00:48:51.983
<v Speaker 2>The media,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you look for those 10 year </v>

1000
00:48:53.691 --> 00:48:54.524
<v Speaker 2>anniversary things or there's a one </v>
<v Speaker 2>example that just stands out to this </v>

1001
00:48:57.201 --> 00:48:58.034
<v Speaker 2>date irritates me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had the highest level of security </v>

1002
00:49:02.091 --> 00:49:02.924
<v Speaker 2>clearances with the cia.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The nsa had a q clearance with the </v>

1003
00:49:05.331 --> 00:49:06.164
<v Speaker 2>department of energy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which means I had access to all the </v>

1004
00:49:08.040 --> 00:49:09.320
<v Speaker 2>secrets and everything else.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1005
00:49:09.321 --> 00:49:13.550
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I top secret special access programs.</v>

1006
00:49:13.610 --> 00:49:14.290
<v Speaker 2>That was me.</v>

1007
00:49:14.290 --> 00:49:15.123
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if you're going to drop any</v>
<v Speaker 3>other secret knowledge while you're </v>

1008
00:49:16.321 --> 00:49:16.470
<v Speaker 3>right,</v>

1009
00:49:16.470 --> 00:49:17.303
<v Speaker 2>if you're right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I had all these clearances and </v>

1010
00:49:18.651 --> 00:49:19.484
<v Speaker 2>everything else.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Time magazine ran a story that I had </v>

1011
00:49:22.881 --> 00:49:27.770
<v Speaker 2>lied on my resume.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now my first reaction when they ran that</v>

1012
00:49:27.771 --> 00:49:28.604
<v Speaker 2>story was sued the bastards.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want to go after him and then my </v>

1013
00:49:31.521 --> 00:49:33.500
<v Speaker 2>lawyer starts explaining to me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

1014
00:49:33.830 --> 00:49:35.030
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>first of all,</v>

1015
00:49:35.031 --> 00:49:35.864
<v Speaker 2>you're going to have to prove they did </v>
<v Speaker 2>it with willful malice because you're a </v>

1016
00:49:37.431 --> 00:49:38.264
<v Speaker 2>public figure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then you're going to have to go through </v>

1017
00:49:40.401 --> 00:49:41.234
<v Speaker 2>all of the strain and time and energy of</v>
<v Speaker 2>depositions in a trial and hearings and </v>

1018
00:49:46.580 --> 00:49:47.413
<v Speaker 2>you want to relive all of that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Or do you really care about time </v>

1019
00:49:49.551 --> 00:49:52.160
<v Speaker 2>magazine having some story that's now </v>
<v Speaker 2>10,</v>

1020
00:49:52.161 --> 00:49:52.994
<v Speaker 2>12,</v>
<v Speaker 2>15 years old about you lied on your </v>

1021
00:49:53.841 --> 00:49:57.860
<v Speaker 2>resume when you Know what the truth is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And half of America knows what the truth</v>

1022
00:49:57.861 --> 00:50:00.710
<v Speaker 2>is and the other half of America you </v>
<v Speaker 2>don't really care about.</v>

1023
00:50:00.740 --> 00:50:01.910
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

1024
00:50:02.780 --> 00:50:06.710
<v Speaker 2>but the media gets by with now I am not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I am not.</v>

1025
00:50:06.740 --> 00:50:09.710
<v Speaker 2>Repeat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not going down the road,</v>

1026
00:50:09.711 --> 00:50:12.620
<v Speaker 2>the trump goes down that says we need to</v>
<v Speaker 2>change the libel laws.</v>

1027
00:50:12.950 --> 00:50:17.950
<v Speaker 2>I'm just pointing out that the media has</v>
<v Speaker 2>this amazing power and with that power I</v>

1028
00:50:18.801 --> 00:50:22.310
<v Speaker 2>believe countries possibility and </v>
<v Speaker 2>they've abdicated the responsibility.</v>

1029
00:50:22.550 --> 00:50:24.950
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't 50 Slash 50 on the libel thing</v>

1030
00:50:24.951 --> 00:50:28.250
<v Speaker 3>and everyone that's watching the show </v>
<v Speaker 3>that I am an free speech.</v>

1031
00:50:28.251 --> 00:50:31.080
<v Speaker 3>Absolute statute is an absolute twice </v>
<v Speaker 3>there,</v>

1032
00:50:31.310 --> 00:50:32.143
<v Speaker 3>but I do believe in libel laws and I do </v>
<v Speaker 3>believe we should have laws to protect </v>

1033
00:50:35.451 --> 00:50:38.150
<v Speaker 3>privacy and a series of other things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

1034
00:50:38.270 --> 00:50:39.103
<v Speaker 3>I would prefer that they don't be </v>
<v Speaker 3>changed because I don't think we need </v>

1035
00:50:40.971 --> 00:50:43.630
<v Speaker 3>the government doing anything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think we need more laws.</v>

1036
00:50:43.640 --> 00:50:45.450
<v Speaker 3>I don't think we need more regulations </v>
<v Speaker 3>or any of that.</v>

1037
00:50:45.820 --> 00:50:46.653
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There is something that I see so </v>

1038
00:50:48.021 --> 00:50:52.490
<v Speaker 3>consistently these days where they Just </v>
<v Speaker 3>pick somebody and it's awful.</v>

1039
00:50:52.491 --> 00:50:53.324
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's often people that I have on this </v>

1040
00:50:54.111 --> 00:50:54.944
<v Speaker 3>show Because they're right in the thick </v>
<v Speaker 3>of have important conversations and we </v>

1041
00:50:57.801 --> 00:50:58.634
<v Speaker 3>say one thing here and then I read the </v>
<v Speaker 3>article about it the day after and it's </v>

1042
00:51:01.671 --> 00:51:04.420
<v Speaker 3>literally the reverse or they cut the </v>
<v Speaker 3>word not right,</v>

1043
00:51:04.730 --> 00:51:05.860
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or didn't.</v>

1044
00:51:06.240 --> 00:51:07.073
<v Speaker 3>it's</v>

1045
00:51:07.490 --> 00:51:08.323
<v Speaker 2>what I have found that I find </v>
<v Speaker 2>fascinating and I know that media is in </v>

1046
00:51:11.091 --> 00:51:11.924
<v Speaker 2>this transition.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You let me look at what you and I are </v>

1047
00:51:13.281 --> 00:51:15.410
<v Speaker 2>doing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They hate what you and I are doing right</v>

1048
00:51:15.411 --> 00:51:18.920
<v Speaker 2>now because it throws away our business </v>
<v Speaker 2>model out the window.</v>

1049
00:51:18.970 --> 00:51:21.950
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think what the.</v>

1050
00:51:22.270 --> 00:51:24.350
<v Speaker 2>Like I'll.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll be doing a story on,</v>

1051
00:51:24.400 --> 00:51:28.020
<v Speaker 2>on air and I've got the article in front</v>
<v Speaker 2>of me and I'm a.</v>

1052
00:51:28.040 --> 00:51:30.280
<v Speaker 2>I'm a kind of a grammar nut and I'll </v>
<v Speaker 2>look at.</v>

1053
00:51:30.290 --> 00:51:31.340
<v Speaker 2>I'll go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>holy crap.</v>

1054
00:51:31.910 --> 00:51:35.360
<v Speaker 2>An editor never even looked at this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The wall street journal.</v>

1055
00:51:36.090 --> 00:51:38.960
<v Speaker 2>You the stellar newspaper,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1056
00:51:39.020 --> 00:51:40.240
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd have.</v>

1057
00:51:40.280 --> 00:51:43.610
<v Speaker 2>They fired all their editors.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I find so many grammatical errors,</v>

1058
00:51:43.611 --> 00:51:44.780
<v Speaker 2>punctuation errors,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all.</v>

1059
00:51:44.960 --> 00:51:49.960
<v Speaker 2>I just think the media is in this flux,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so you add the flux With their agenda at</v>

1060
00:51:54.801 --> 00:51:58.640
<v Speaker 2>times their sloppiness.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You had all of those things together.</v>

1061
00:51:58.880 --> 00:52:03.170
<v Speaker 2>The media is just not filling their </v>
<v Speaker 2>fourth estate responsibilities.</v>

1062
00:52:03.300 --> 00:52:04.133
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So how do we clean up some of this </v>

1063
00:52:05.371 --> 00:52:07.080
<v Speaker 3>government stuff?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I suspect,</v>

1064
00:52:07.081 --> 00:52:09.180
<v Speaker 3>although you just saId you're not with </v>
<v Speaker 3>trump on the,</v>

1065
00:52:09.181 --> 00:52:09.830
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>alIve,</v>

1066
00:52:09.830 --> 00:52:10.663
<v Speaker 3>but I suspect that there's a certain </v>
<v Speaker 3>amount of deregulation that he's doing </v>

1067
00:52:14.851 --> 00:52:17.580
<v Speaker 3>and cutting back some of these agencies </v>
<v Speaker 3>that you got to be pretty happy with</v>

1068
00:52:18.840 --> 00:52:22.710
<v Speaker 2>static about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When you think about this whole,</v>

1069
00:52:24.090 --> 00:52:27.840
<v Speaker 2>you'll find it so bizarre example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but whether it's here in California,</v>

1070
00:52:27.841 --> 00:52:29.040
<v Speaker 2>back in Colorado,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wherever,</v>

1071
00:52:29.070 --> 00:52:33.630
<v Speaker 2>wherever we might might be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I challenge people watching this go look</v>

1072
00:52:33.631 --> 00:52:34.464
<v Speaker 2>at any government office and I would bet</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's the nicest office building in your </v>

1073
00:52:39.301 --> 00:52:40.570
<v Speaker 2>community.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>

1074
00:52:40.590 --> 00:52:42.060
<v Speaker 2>wait a minute.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Who paid for that?</v>

1075
00:52:42.990 --> 00:52:46.740
<v Speaker 2>The guys in the garage who were coming </v>
<v Speaker 2>up with the next big thing,</v>

1076
00:52:47.370 --> 00:52:52.140
<v Speaker 2>assam startup company or some guidance </v>
<v Speaker 2>working an eight to five blue collar job</v>

1077
00:52:52.141 --> 00:52:52.974
<v Speaker 2>that got his hands dirty and his nails </v>
<v Speaker 2>are cracked and he's working with his </v>

1078
00:52:55.411 --> 00:52:58.430
<v Speaker 2>hands like crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're paying for that is,</v>

1079
00:52:58.440 --> 00:52:59.273
<v Speaker 2>It shouldn't be the reverse fact.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Shouldn't the government actually be in </v>

1080
00:53:01.771 --> 00:53:02.900
<v Speaker 2>the garages?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Shouldn't they?</v>

1081
00:53:02.901 --> 00:53:05.880
<v Speaker 2>Actually be the ones that are in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>office buildings that you know,</v>

1082
00:53:06.000 --> 00:53:06.833
<v Speaker 2>they have to go up 20 elevatorS to get </v>
<v Speaker 2>to their offices instead of having all </v>

1083
00:53:09.571 --> 00:53:13.470
<v Speaker 2>the edifices that we allow them to use </v>
<v Speaker 2>and create and build.</v>

1084
00:53:13.680 --> 00:53:14.513
<v Speaker 2>We have this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we have this perverted sense that the </v>

1085
00:53:17.400 --> 00:53:19.080
<v Speaker 2>government,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I think it's getting worse,</v>

1086
00:53:19.350 --> 00:53:20.183
<v Speaker 2>that the government is the answer to </v>
<v Speaker 2>everything and that somehow government </v>

1087
00:53:22.841 --> 00:53:23.674
<v Speaker 2>is going to solve all of our problems.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let tell you the government doesn't </v>

1088
00:53:27.301 --> 00:53:30.180
<v Speaker 2>solve problems.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The government causes problems.</v>

1089
00:53:31.710 --> 00:53:33.660
<v Speaker 2>So what would you say the answer is </v>
<v Speaker 2>related to?</v>

1090
00:53:33.661 --> 00:53:38.400
<v Speaker 2>So at dhs or fema now or anything else?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean if these things didn't exist,</v>

1091
00:53:38.401 --> 00:53:39.870
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure somebody is watching this right</v>
<v Speaker 2>now.</v>

1092
00:53:40.550 --> 00:53:42.360
<v Speaker 2>What do you mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean if these things didn't exist,</v>

1093
00:53:42.600 --> 00:53:45.900
<v Speaker 2>well now you know new orleans still is </v>
<v Speaker 2>below sea level,</v>

1094
00:53:45.901 --> 00:53:46.734
<v Speaker 2>which is a whole in that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was just talking about that for a </v>

1095
00:53:48.811 --> 00:53:49.644
<v Speaker 2>second.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There are a certain amount of people </v>

1096
00:53:50.671 --> 00:53:51.720
<v Speaker 2>that now say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1097
00:53:51.721 --> 00:53:52.554
<v Speaker 2>wait a minute,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wait a minute.</v>

1098
00:53:52.740 --> 00:53:54.360
<v Speaker 2>Because they don't realize it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then they hear it and they go,</v>

1099
00:53:54.361 --> 00:53:55.194
<v Speaker 2>wait a minute.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We have a city that's below sea level </v>

1100
00:53:56.701 --> 00:53:59.400
<v Speaker 2>that has all of these structural </v>
<v Speaker 2>problems.</v>

1101
00:53:59.940 --> 00:54:01.560
<v Speaker 2>Maybe we shouldn't be living there </v>
<v Speaker 2>anymore.</v>

1102
00:54:01.840 --> 00:54:04.230
<v Speaker 2>What do you say to someone like that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>First of all,</v>

1103
00:54:04.231 --> 00:54:06.300
<v Speaker 2>I think anybody should be able to live </v>
<v Speaker 2>wherever they want to live.</v>

1104
00:54:06.500 --> 00:54:07.333
<v Speaker 2>If if,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if I want to live next to the national </v>

1105
00:54:09.061 --> 00:54:11.250
<v Speaker 2>forest in boulder county,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Colorado,</v>

1106
00:54:11.430 --> 00:54:12.263
<v Speaker 2>I should be able to do that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but then I should also assume the risk </v>

1107
00:54:14.580 --> 00:54:15.413
<v Speaker 2>of living there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If I want to live on the fault lines in </v>

1108
00:54:18.301 --> 00:54:20.490
<v Speaker 2>California,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I should be able to do that,</v>

1109
00:54:20.640 --> 00:54:22.130
<v Speaker 2>but I should assume the risk.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1110
00:54:22.140 --> 00:54:24.930
<v Speaker 2>I think government has some basic </v>
<v Speaker 2>services to provide.</v>

1111
00:54:24.931 --> 00:54:27.420
<v Speaker 2>We all agree the police protection,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fire protection,</v>

1112
00:54:27.421 --> 00:54:28.254
<v Speaker 2>that's something we all want to pay for,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if you're going to deliberately </v>

1113
00:54:32.311 --> 00:54:37.311
<v Speaker 2>choose to live below sea level and then </v>
<v Speaker 2>why should I want to be very careful.</v>

1114
00:54:40.660 --> 00:54:42.510
<v Speaker 2>I can feel it already.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why it's slippery.</v>

1115
00:54:42.760 --> 00:54:46.800
<v Speaker 2>It's slippery because I think they </v>
<v Speaker 2>should be able to live there.</v>

1116
00:54:47.190 --> 00:54:51.750
<v Speaker 2>If you choose to live there though,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's the responsibility of the taxpayers</v>

1117
00:54:51.930 --> 00:54:52.763
<v Speaker 2>that lived there to create those levies </v>
<v Speaker 2>and build those levies and maintain </v>

1118
00:54:56.221 --> 00:54:58.620
<v Speaker 2>those levees.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because I don't live there.</v>

1119
00:54:59.070 --> 00:54:59.903
<v Speaker 2>It's not my responsibility.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I pay taxes to take care of the hazard </v>

1120
00:55:03.451 --> 00:55:04.284
<v Speaker 2>where I live and frankly I don't think </v>
<v Speaker 2>the government should take care of all </v>

1121
00:55:06.781 --> 00:55:07.614
<v Speaker 2>hazards because if we tried to start,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if we start trying to protect the </v>

1122
00:55:11.821 --> 00:55:15.270
<v Speaker 2>american population from all of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>hazards that we face,</v>

1123
00:55:15.540 --> 00:55:16.373
<v Speaker 2>we will end up with a totalitarian </v>
<v Speaker 2>government because there's too many </v>

1124
00:55:20.191 --> 00:55:21.024
<v Speaker 2>hazards.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So this is sort of the case where the </v>

1125
00:55:23.251 --> 00:55:26.190
<v Speaker 2>people that that were down there in new </v>
<v Speaker 2>orleans,</v>

1126
00:55:26.310 --> 00:55:27.570
<v Speaker 2>that ally,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not just.</v>

1127
00:55:27.650 --> 00:55:29.760
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure most of them had earned.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't say most,</v>

1128
00:55:29.761 --> 00:55:32.130
<v Speaker 2>but I'm sure a good portion,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at least in the people that had money,</v>

1129
00:55:32.250 --> 00:55:34.680
<v Speaker 2>had insurance and probably had flood </v>
<v Speaker 2>insurance and everything else,</v>

1130
00:55:35.100 --> 00:55:35.933
<v Speaker 2>but it's that afterwards,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all this federal money comes in to help </v>

1131
00:55:38.551 --> 00:55:39.180
<v Speaker 2>the rebuild.</v>

1132
00:55:39.180 --> 00:55:43.380
<v Speaker 2>But you're saying there perhaps that </v>
<v Speaker 2>that doesn't quite make sense.</v>

1133
00:55:43.381 --> 00:55:44.214
<v Speaker 2>Is that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that basically there will be people </v>

1134
00:55:46.921 --> 00:55:48.000
<v Speaker 2>who will say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh my god,</v>

1135
00:55:48.001 --> 00:55:48.834
<v Speaker 2>the former director of federal emergency</v>
<v Speaker 2>management agency is saying we should </v>

1136
00:55:52.171 --> 00:55:54.270
<v Speaker 2>revisit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely.</v>

1137
00:55:54.330 --> 00:55:56.640
<v Speaker 2>We have a concept of federalism in this </v>
<v Speaker 2>country.</v>

1138
00:55:56.641 --> 00:56:00.180
<v Speaker 2>We have federal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>state and local government and at at the</v>

1139
00:56:00.181 --> 00:56:01.650
<v Speaker 2>top load,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's reverse that.</v>

1140
00:56:01.800 --> 00:56:03.840
<v Speaker 2>We have the people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we have local government,</v>

1141
00:56:03.841 --> 00:56:04.674
<v Speaker 2>state government and federal government.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the order and what we have done </v>

1142
00:56:08.400 --> 00:56:09.233
<v Speaker 2>is we've taken the federal government </v>
<v Speaker 2>and we've almost made them the local </v>

1143
00:56:13.111 --> 00:56:13.944
<v Speaker 2>fire department.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We've almost made them the local police </v>

1144
00:56:15.631 --> 00:56:17.490
<v Speaker 2>department and the many aspects.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's actually true.</v>

1145
00:56:17.520 --> 00:56:18.353
<v Speaker 2>Tsa for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we've made them a local police </v>

1146
00:56:19.921 --> 00:56:22.980
<v Speaker 2>department.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Even though I want to be a lawyer here,</v>

1147
00:56:23.170 --> 00:56:25.780
<v Speaker 2>they have no law enforcement authority.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They just think they do,</v>

1148
00:56:26.050 --> 00:56:28.360
<v Speaker 2>but they have zero law enforcement </v>
<v Speaker 2>authority.</v>

1149
00:56:29.050 --> 00:56:29.883
<v Speaker 2>What does it actually mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>They have zero law enforcement </v>

1150
00:56:31.511 --> 00:56:32.470
<v Speaker 2>authority.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean if they.</v>

1151
00:56:32.650 --> 00:56:35.930
<v Speaker 2>If you go through and you've got a knife</v>
<v Speaker 2>in your pocket like,</v>

1152
00:56:35.950 --> 00:56:36.783
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then they just hand you off to whoever </v>

1153
00:56:37.601 --> 00:56:39.570
<v Speaker 2>the local daniel,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you got to get a cup.</v>

1154
00:56:39.730 --> 00:56:40.830
<v Speaker 2>I think I'd get a cop.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They can.</v>

1155
00:56:40.870 --> 00:56:42.190
<v Speaker 2>They can arrest you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they cannot detain you,</v>

1156
00:56:42.191 --> 00:56:43.024
<v Speaker 2>they can't do anything,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they call themselves officers </v>

1157
00:56:44.831 --> 00:56:45.664
<v Speaker 2>because they wouldn't put on the mask of</v>
<v Speaker 2>authority because government always </v>

1158
00:56:47.951 --> 00:56:51.700
<v Speaker 2>wants to put on the mask of authority </v>
<v Speaker 2>because that's how you keep the citizens</v>

1159
00:56:52.980 --> 00:56:54.040
<v Speaker 2>kind of subdued.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

1160
00:56:54.340 --> 00:56:55.173
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my whole point about female becoming </v>

1161
00:56:57.401 --> 00:56:58.234
<v Speaker 2>kind of this first responder,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the more we rely on the federal </v>

1162
00:57:00.701 --> 00:57:01.534
<v Speaker 2>government to come in after any sort of </v>
<v Speaker 2>disaster that weakened state and local </v>

1163
00:57:05.681 --> 00:57:06.514
<v Speaker 2>governments because they become more and</v>
<v Speaker 2>more dependent upon the federal </v>

1164
00:57:08.381 --> 00:57:11.110
<v Speaker 2>government.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So more and more things get nationalized</v>

1165
00:57:11.260 --> 00:57:15.970
<v Speaker 2>and the more things get nationalized,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the more we turn into a western european</v>

1166
00:57:15.971 --> 00:57:16.804
<v Speaker 2>socialist type government,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which we know it's not going to happen </v>

1167
00:57:19.211 --> 00:57:19.960
<v Speaker 2>in our lifetimes.</v>

1168
00:57:19.960 --> 00:57:20.793
<v Speaker 2>Don't get me wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not.</v>

1169
00:57:20.820 --> 00:57:22.420
<v Speaker 2>I'm the tinfoil hatS.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not on,</v>

1170
00:57:22.770 --> 00:57:23.603
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I do believe that republics </v>

1171
00:57:26.140 --> 00:57:26.973
<v Speaker 2>eventually fail and we are on this path </v>
<v Speaker 2>that if we keep going down this path of </v>

1172
00:57:31.661 --> 00:57:35.110
<v Speaker 2>throwing more and more things up against</v>
<v Speaker 2>the wall for the federal government to,</v>

1173
00:57:35.270 --> 00:57:36.103
<v Speaker 2>to handle and take care of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we will end up as a western european </v>

1174
00:57:39.641 --> 00:57:40.474
<v Speaker 2>socialist government and over </v>
<v Speaker 2>generations and generations that leads </v>

1175
00:57:43.751 --> 00:57:44.584
<v Speaker 2>to tyranny.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So then you must be digging trump on </v>

1176
00:57:48.701 --> 00:57:49.570
<v Speaker 2>this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

1177
00:57:49.571 --> 00:57:50.710
<v Speaker 2>and this stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely.</v>

1178
00:57:50.711 --> 00:57:51.460
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The thing,</v>

1179
00:57:51.460 --> 00:57:53.270
<v Speaker 2>the thing that bothers me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

1180
00:57:53.850 --> 00:57:56.290
<v Speaker 2>the president wasn't my first choice and</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

1181
00:57:56.380 --> 00:57:59.350
<v Speaker 2>before we go too deep and I do want to </v>
<v Speaker 2>mention that we are taping this a little</v>

1182
00:57:59.351 --> 00:58:00.700
<v Speaker 2>bit in advance of when it's going to </v>
<v Speaker 2>air.</v>

1183
00:58:00.701 --> 00:58:04.840
<v Speaker 2>So I just want to be very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very clear.</v>

1184
00:58:04.841 --> 00:58:08.310
<v Speaker 2>But who knows what happened to the guys.</v>

1185
00:58:08.620 --> 00:58:10.180
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it wasn't my first choice,</v>

1186
00:58:10.181 --> 00:58:11.014
<v Speaker 2>but when it came down to the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to the typical dichotomy of republican </v>

1187
00:58:13.811 --> 00:58:15.780
<v Speaker 2>versus democrat have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1188
00:58:15.820 --> 00:58:16.653
<v Speaker 2>I still think I still want to believe </v>
<v Speaker 2>that republicans or the government of </v>

1189
00:58:20.261 --> 00:58:22.510
<v Speaker 2>individualism and individual liberty and</v>
<v Speaker 2>everything,</v>

1190
00:58:22.511 --> 00:58:23.344
<v Speaker 2>although I could argue that they aren't </v>
<v Speaker 2>necessarily that way and the democrats </v>

1191
00:58:26.660 --> 00:58:30.190
<v Speaker 2>are moving to the hard progressive,</v>
<v Speaker 2>almost marxist left.</v>

1192
00:58:30.550 --> 00:58:32.380
<v Speaker 2>So when it comes to the general </v>
<v Speaker 2>election,</v>

1193
00:58:32.770 --> 00:58:35.620
<v Speaker 2>if I want to vote for one of those two,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to vote for trump.</v>

1194
00:58:36.250 --> 00:58:41.250
<v Speaker 2>I only say that because he has totally </v>
<v Speaker 2>up into what it means.</v>

1195
00:58:45.310 --> 00:58:49.180
<v Speaker 2>I work for george w dot buSh who people </v>
<v Speaker 2>thought couldn't speak well.</v>

1196
00:58:49.360 --> 00:58:52.560
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I thought was smart,</v>

1197
00:58:53.020 --> 00:58:54.650
<v Speaker 2>knew what he was doing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A,</v>

1198
00:58:54.700 --> 00:58:57.190
<v Speaker 2>I think trump is smart.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think he knows what he's doing,</v>

1199
00:58:57.490 --> 00:58:58.323
<v Speaker 2>but he's the first president in this age</v>
<v Speaker 2>of twitter and facebook and everything </v>

1200
00:59:02.201 --> 00:59:03.034
<v Speaker 2>else.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I just don't think we've quite </v>

1201
00:59:03.371 --> 00:59:07.030
<v Speaker 2>figured out how to deal with that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And quite honestly,</v>

1202
00:59:07.031 --> 00:59:09.130
<v Speaker 2>I don't think he's quite figured out how</v>
<v Speaker 2>to deal with it.</v>

1203
00:59:09.640 --> 00:59:12.610
<v Speaker 2>He hasn't quite figured out that as </v>
<v Speaker 2>president,</v>

1204
00:59:12.670 --> 00:59:17.320
<v Speaker 2>if I say something even innocuous,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're reading,</v>

1205
00:59:18.230 --> 00:59:22.790
<v Speaker 2>they're reading that in moscow,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're reading that in pyongyang there,</v>

1206
00:59:22.791 --> 00:59:25.730
<v Speaker 2>reading it everywhere and so he needs to</v>
<v Speaker 2>be a little more.</v>

1207
00:59:25.790 --> 00:59:29.450
<v Speaker 2>I just wish it would be a little more </v>
<v Speaker 2>circumspect with use of social media.</v>

1208
00:59:29.540 --> 00:59:30.110
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1209
00:59:30.110 --> 00:59:31.330
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know enough about trump.</v>

1210
00:59:31.340 --> 00:59:32.810
<v Speaker 3>Let.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let's just talk about George W.</v>

1211
00:59:32.810 --> 00:59:34.040
<v Speaker 3>Bush for a second because you mentioned </v>
<v Speaker 3>he was.</v>

1212
00:59:34.070 --> 00:59:34.960
<v Speaker 3>He was your boss,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know.</v>

1213
00:59:35.010 --> 00:59:35.691
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1214
00:59:35.691 --> 00:59:36.524
<v Speaker 3>there was the caricature of course,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of all the years of his presidency that </v>

1215
00:59:38.511 --> 00:59:40.490
<v Speaker 3>he was some sort of idiot or you know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

1216
00:59:40.491 --> 00:59:41.324
<v Speaker 3>He had a strange way of speaking and </v>
<v Speaker 3>kind of stilted and met a lot of that </v>

1217
00:59:46.641 --> 00:59:50.080
<v Speaker 3>writing mixed up a lot of words.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

1218
00:59:50.420 --> 00:59:51.253
<v Speaker 3>Tell me something about him that maybe </v>
<v Speaker 3>would give us a little other side that </v>

1219
00:59:53.871 --> 00:59:56.040
<v Speaker 3>we would know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sure.</v>

1220
00:59:56.060 --> 00:59:57.920
<v Speaker 3>There's an odd nostalgia.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what I'm saying.</v>

1221
00:59:58.180 --> 01:00:01.180
<v Speaker 3>There's an odd nostalgia about him now </v>
<v Speaker 3>because I see it from people on the left</v>

1222
01:00:01.181 --> 01:00:01.931
<v Speaker 3>all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now they're,</v>

1223
01:00:01.931 --> 01:00:04.360
<v Speaker 3>they're sort of galvanIzing him right </v>
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>

1224
01:00:04.380 --> 01:00:06.000
<v Speaker 3>There are lionizing him now.</v>

1225
01:00:06.350 --> 01:00:09.840
<v Speaker 2>He,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he and I were in the limo,</v>

1226
01:00:09.870 --> 01:00:12.090
<v Speaker 2>we were in the beast,</v>
<v Speaker 2>southern California,</v>

1227
01:00:12.570 --> 01:00:13.403
<v Speaker 2>going back to a marine one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and we're on these kind of rural areas </v>

1228
01:00:18.420 --> 01:00:21.810
<v Speaker 2>and people have lined the streets and </v>
<v Speaker 2>eddie,</v>

1229
01:00:21.811 --> 01:00:25.320
<v Speaker 2>who was his agent in charge of </v>
<v Speaker 2>presidential detail,</v>

1230
01:00:25.950 --> 01:00:26.783
<v Speaker 2>he kept telling eddie,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I wouldn't use these words </v>

1231
01:00:28.291 --> 01:00:31.200
<v Speaker 2>carefully,</v>
<v Speaker 2>eddie stop the car.</v>

1232
01:00:31.710 --> 01:00:34.260
<v Speaker 2>These people want to see their </v>
<v Speaker 2>president.</v>

1233
01:00:35.220 --> 01:00:36.053
<v Speaker 2>It wasn't eddie stopped the car.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They want to see me and he don't stop </v>

1234
01:00:38.551 --> 01:00:40.170
<v Speaker 2>the car because they want to see,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1235
01:00:40.230 --> 01:00:41.210
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's me and brown.</v>

1236
01:00:41.340 --> 01:00:43.650
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they want to see their president.</v>

1237
01:00:44.400 --> 01:00:45.233
<v Speaker 2>He had this understanding of that office</v>
<v Speaker 2>was his temporarily and he was </v>

1238
01:00:50.940 --> 01:00:51.773
<v Speaker 2>everybody's president and I saw that in </v>
<v Speaker 2>that car and then I saw at one time in </v>

1239
01:00:56.461 --> 01:01:01.461
<v Speaker 2>the oval office we were sitting in and </v>
<v Speaker 2>press office comes through with a gaggle</v>

1240
01:01:01.861 --> 01:01:06.861
<v Speaker 2>of kids and he stops the meeting </v>
<v Speaker 2>entirely and shows these kids.</v>

1241
01:01:07.860 --> 01:01:09.990
<v Speaker 2>I mean they missed maybe sixth grade or </v>
<v Speaker 2>seventh graders.</v>

1242
01:01:10.320 --> 01:01:11.153
<v Speaker 2>Shows them the resolute desk and </v>
<v Speaker 2>explains to them the history of the </v>

1243
01:01:13.411 --> 01:01:16.620
<v Speaker 2>resolute desk and I'm sitting there </v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

1244
01:01:16.900 --> 01:01:20.310
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can watch this all day long.</v>

1245
01:01:20.460 --> 01:01:23.090
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then a third story we.</v>

1246
01:01:23.980 --> 01:01:27.120
<v Speaker 2>It was the first presidential debate of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the 2004 election.</v>

1247
01:01:28.770 --> 01:01:30.090
<v Speaker 2>He,</v>
<v Speaker 2>gemini,</v>

1248
01:01:30.190 --> 01:01:31.023
<v Speaker 2>I in the car,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we'd been at some hurricane center </v>

1249
01:01:34.740 --> 01:01:35.573
<v Speaker 2>somewhere and jeb turns to him and says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's time to for you to go to </v>

1250
01:01:41.340 --> 01:01:42.630
<v Speaker 2>hotel,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you need to.</v>

1251
01:01:42.750 --> 01:01:46.950
<v Speaker 2>You really need to bone up and study </v>
<v Speaker 2>some bushes.</v>

1252
01:01:46.951 --> 01:01:47.491
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>nah,</v>

1253
01:01:47.491 --> 01:01:49.980
<v Speaker 2>you know I'm going to whip his ass.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was kind of a job.</v>

1254
01:01:49.981 --> 01:01:54.300
<v Speaker 2>He was kind of a frat boy alone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was kind of a frat boy,</v>

1255
01:01:54.330 --> 01:01:56.840
<v Speaker 2>jocular funding crack jokes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1256
01:01:56.880 --> 01:01:59.910
<v Speaker 2>smarted off.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm never inappropriately,</v>
