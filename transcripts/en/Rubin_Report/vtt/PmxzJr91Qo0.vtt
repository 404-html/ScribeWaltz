1
00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:05.190
<v Speaker 1>To start this week's direct message with</v>
<v Speaker 1>a trigger warning.</v>

2
00:00:05.191 --> 00:00:06.570
<v Speaker 1>That's right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so take a moment,</v>

3
00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:07.643
<v Speaker 1>get a design comfy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and move carefully to your safe space </v>

4
00:00:09.871 --> 00:00:11.910
<v Speaker 1>because we've got to talk.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll actually wait for</v>

5
00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:14.980
<v Speaker 2>bit.</v>

6
00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:28.680
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that did it.</v>

7
00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:30.690
<v Speaker 1>Now that you've been triggered,</v>
<v Speaker 1>warranty Leah,</v>

8
00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:31.613
<v Speaker 1>let's talk about free speech.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It feels like it's on the ropes these </v>

9
00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:34.350
<v Speaker 1>days,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

10
00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:35.183
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we've been talking a lot about it here </v>

11
00:00:36.121 --> 00:00:36.954
<v Speaker 1>in the context of how the regressive </v>
<v Speaker 1>stifled debate by calling everyone </v>

12
00:00:40.051 --> 00:00:41.070
<v Speaker 1>racist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sexist,</v>

13
00:00:41.071 --> 00:00:42.330
<v Speaker 1>homophobic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or the rest.</v>

14
00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:43.463
<v Speaker 1>This very concept tolerance for </v>
<v Speaker 1>intolerance has been taking root at </v>

15
00:00:47.041 --> 00:00:50.730
<v Speaker 1>college campuses across the country for </v>
<v Speaker 1>quite some time now.</v>

16
00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:51.593
<v Speaker 1>There are two completely separate </v>
<v Speaker 1>situations unfolding right this very </v>

17
00:00:54.181 --> 00:00:55.014
<v Speaker 1>moment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One is on the campus of Yale where some </v>

18
00:00:56.491 --> 00:00:57.324
<v Speaker 1>students were upset that a professor </v>
<v Speaker 1>wrote a letter defending the right to </v>

19
00:01:00.571 --> 00:01:01.404
<v Speaker 1>wear offensive Halloween costumes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The letter in part explained that you </v>

20
00:01:04.171 --> 00:01:05.004
<v Speaker 1>can either ignore the costume altogether</v>
<v Speaker 1>or you can engage in the person wearing </v>

21
00:01:08.821 --> 00:01:11.250
<v Speaker 1>the costume,</v>
<v Speaker 1>telling them why you find it offensive.</v>

22
00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:12.383
<v Speaker 1>Apparently this wasn't enough for some </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the students culminating and video </v>

23
00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:18.500
<v Speaker 1>that has now gone viral in which a </v>
<v Speaker 1>student's screams at the dean quote.</v>

24
00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:21.480
<v Speaker 1>It's not about creating an intellectual </v>
<v Speaker 1>space.</v>

25
00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:26.720
<v Speaker 1>It's about creating a home here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The other situation is at the University</v>

26
00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:27.803
<v Speaker 1>of Missouri where students were fed up </v>
<v Speaker 1>with a series of racially motivated </v>

27
00:01:29.881 --> 00:01:30.714
<v Speaker 1>instances they felt weren't being </v>
<v Speaker 1>properly dealt with by the </v>

28
00:01:33.001 --> 00:01:33.834
<v Speaker 1>administration.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The students demand to the resignation </v>

29
00:01:35.791 --> 00:01:36.624
<v Speaker 1>of the president,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which he submitted after the mostly </v>

30
00:01:38.911 --> 00:01:43.110
<v Speaker 1>black football team got involved.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A video on campus has also gone viral,</v>

31
00:01:43.111 --> 00:01:45.660
<v Speaker 1>showing a young journalist trying to </v>
<v Speaker 1>cover the protest,</v>

32
00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:48.570
<v Speaker 1>but being screamed at and bullied by a </v>
<v Speaker 1>group of students.</v>

33
00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:49.613
<v Speaker 1>Ironically,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these students are trying to silence </v>

34
00:01:51.211 --> 00:01:52.044
<v Speaker 1>someone who was only there to cover the </v>
<v Speaker 1>very protest that they wanted attention </v>

35
00:01:55.231 --> 00:01:56.064
<v Speaker 1>for.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For one of the oldest and largest </v>

36
00:01:57.391 --> 00:01:58.224
<v Speaker 1>journalism schools in America.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It seems that Mou has gotten something </v>

37
00:02:00.691 --> 00:02:03.180
<v Speaker 1>very wrong about free speech.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of course,</v>

38
00:02:03.181 --> 00:02:05.400
<v Speaker 1>these two instances are not isolated in </v>
<v Speaker 1>America,</v>

39
00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:07.560
<v Speaker 1>nor in other parts of the Western world.</v>

40
00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:08.393
<v Speaker 1>Colleges and universities are the very </v>
<v Speaker 1>places you're supposed to go to engage </v>

41
00:02:11.881 --> 00:02:12.714
<v Speaker 1>in the battle of ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>To learn new ways of thinking and to </v>

42
00:02:15.031 --> 00:02:15.864
<v Speaker 1>challenge your preconceived notions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yet somehow colleges are the very place </v>

43
00:02:19.381 --> 00:02:22.140
<v Speaker 1>that had become hostile to all of these </v>
<v Speaker 1>concepts.</v>

44
00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:25.530
<v Speaker 1>Now shouting down speakers you don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>agree with demanding professors,</v>

45
00:02:25.531 --> 00:02:26.364
<v Speaker 1>be fired for contrarian views and </v>
<v Speaker 1>denying the media free and unfettered </v>

46
00:02:29.761 --> 00:02:33.600
<v Speaker 1>access have found their home in these </v>
<v Speaker 1>safe spaces.</v>

47
00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:34.523
<v Speaker 1>Of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this all ties in perfectly with </v>

48
00:02:35.431 --> 00:02:37.170
<v Speaker 1>everything we've been talking about on </v>
<v Speaker 1>this show.</v>

49
00:02:37.171 --> 00:02:38.004
<v Speaker 1>The regressive left by calling everyone </v>
<v Speaker 1>racists and bigots and homophobes and </v>

50
00:02:41.101 --> 00:02:45.780
<v Speaker 1>the rest have ushered in a generation of</v>
<v Speaker 1>people who were so sure in their beliefs</v>

51
00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:50.700
<v Speaker 1>and so dismissive of their opponents </v>
<v Speaker 1>ideals that they have no reason to stand</v>

52
00:02:50.701 --> 00:02:54.330
<v Speaker 1>up for free speech anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If your opponent is a racist or a bigot,</v>

53
00:02:54.331 --> 00:02:55.740
<v Speaker 1>then why even engage with them?</v>

54
00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:56.813
<v Speaker 1>You've got the moral high ground,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so just shout them down or call them </v>

55
00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:01.600
<v Speaker 1>until they give up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These are the tactics.</v>

56
00:03:01.601 --> 00:03:02.434
<v Speaker 1>The regressive have used successfully in</v>
<v Speaker 1>so many areas and now we're seeing the </v>

57
00:03:06.251 --> 00:03:08.410
<v Speaker 1>fruits of their labor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to be very clear here.</v>

58
00:03:08.411 --> 00:03:12.610
<v Speaker 1>Nothing I'm saying is dismissive of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>actual issues these college students are</v>

59
00:03:12.611 --> 00:03:13.444
<v Speaker 1>dealing with.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There is no doubt we have racial </v>

60
00:03:15.101 --> 00:03:17.440
<v Speaker 1>problems in this country.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have a quality problems.</v>

61
00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:20.380
<v Speaker 1>We have wealth disparity problems and </v>
<v Speaker 1>the list goes on and on,</v>

62
00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:23.800
<v Speaker 1>but these problems won't go away if we </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't talk about them.</v>

63
00:03:23.801 --> 00:03:24.634
<v Speaker 1>They won't magically resolve themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If we only talk to people we agree with </v>

64
00:03:28.031 --> 00:03:30.190
<v Speaker 1>actually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they'll only get much worse.</v>

65
00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:31.293
<v Speaker 1>This is the inherent flaw of identity </v>
<v Speaker 1>politics that the regressives love so </v>

66
00:03:34.661 --> 00:03:35.494
<v Speaker 1>much.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you whittle us all down just to </v>

67
00:03:37.121 --> 00:03:38.140
<v Speaker 1>race,</v>
<v Speaker 1>religion,</v>

68
00:03:38.141 --> 00:03:39.670
<v Speaker 1>nationality,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sexuality,</v>

69
00:03:39.671 --> 00:03:44.080
<v Speaker 1>or whatever else there is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's very little left to unite us.</v>

70
00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:48.160
<v Speaker 1>I'd much rather look at people based on </v>
<v Speaker 1>their ideas and their beliefs.</v>

71
00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:49.143
<v Speaker 1>Those are the principles that unite us </v>
<v Speaker 1>across the divide that the regressive </v>

72
00:03:52.121 --> 00:03:54.850
<v Speaker 1>left has been digging.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've been saying for awhile now,</v>

73
00:03:54.851 --> 00:03:57.430
<v Speaker 1>the two things can be true at once.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In this case,</v>

74
00:03:57.431 --> 00:03:58.264
<v Speaker 1>it can be true that these students have </v>
<v Speaker 1>legitimate grievances and at the same </v>

75
00:04:00.731 --> 00:04:01.564
<v Speaker 1>time it can be true that free speech </v>
<v Speaker 1>shouldn't be sacrificed on the altar of </v>

76
00:04:05.231 --> 00:04:06.064
<v Speaker 1>political correctness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We should be more worried about the </v>

77
00:04:07.841 --> 00:04:08.674
<v Speaker 1>government taking away our free speech </v>
<v Speaker 1>rather than us taking it away from </v>

78
00:04:11.651 --> 00:04:12.484
<v Speaker 1>ourselves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some say the road to hell is paved with </v>

79
00:04:13.781 --> 00:04:16.630
<v Speaker 1>good intentions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some say the ends justify the means.</v>

80
00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:20.050
<v Speaker 1>Some just want to shut you up and that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you have to speak the loudest.</v>

81
00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:23.523
<v Speaker 1>Joining me this week as a human rights </v>
<v Speaker 1>activist who grew up in a place not too </v>

82
00:04:26.831 --> 00:04:30.160
<v Speaker 1>kind to freethinkers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Currently he's the Middle East community</v>

83
00:04:30.161 --> 00:04:34.640
<v Speaker 1>manager of movements dot Org and </v>
<v Speaker 1>organization dedicated to open and close</v>

84
00:04:34.641 --> 00:04:37.450
<v Speaker 1>societies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He also happens to be in Los Angeles for</v>

85
00:04:37.451 --> 00:04:38.710
<v Speaker 1>the first time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

86
00:04:38.711 --> 00:04:40.230
<v Speaker 1>This very second.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Feisal,</v>

87
00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:43.540
<v Speaker 1>Syeda Macarthur who welcome to the show.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who all affect you that hiring me.</v>

88
00:04:43.541 --> 00:04:47.150
<v Speaker 1>I mean I thank you for bringing sanitary</v>
<v Speaker 1>towel overall.</v>

89
00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:49.870
<v Speaker 1>I've been a big fan of your show since </v>
<v Speaker 1>it started,</v>

90
00:04:49.871 --> 00:04:53.020
<v Speaker 1>so wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Saturday to all of the world.</v>

91
00:04:53.510 --> 00:04:57.540
<v Speaker 1>I would say so because like I've seen </v>
<v Speaker 1>your video being shared of lexile.</v>

92
00:04:57.590 --> 00:05:00.060
<v Speaker 1>I have friends who will live in in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Middle East and and,</v>

93
00:05:00.190 --> 00:05:04.810
<v Speaker 1>and they were all talking about you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it's certainly great to be here.</v>

94
00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:06.160
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's very rewarding.</v>

95
00:05:06.161 --> 00:05:07.330
<v Speaker 1>We could probably on the show right </v>
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>

96
00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:10.210
<v Speaker 1>we'll talk a little bit about you as </v>
<v Speaker 1>well.</v>

97
00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:11.140
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

98
00:05:11.141 --> 00:05:14.470
<v Speaker 1>I want to talk about your personal story</v>
<v Speaker 1>and coming from Iraq and all that,</v>

99
00:05:14.471 --> 00:05:15.304
<v Speaker 1>which is really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's really a wonderful story and it's </v>

100
00:05:16.511 --> 00:05:19.840
<v Speaker 1>so a perfectly lined up with a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 1>things we've been talking about here.</v>

101
00:05:19.841 --> 00:05:20.674
<v Speaker 1>But first I want to talk about how I </v>
<v Speaker 1>came to know you a because the second </v>

102
00:05:24.341 --> 00:05:26.420
<v Speaker 1>episode that we did have this show on </v>
<v Speaker 1>Oprah.</v>

103
00:05:26.710 --> 00:05:27.543
<v Speaker 1>I had Karen Santa Maria on and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a few days before that she had been </v>

104
00:05:32.831 --> 00:05:33.664
<v Speaker 1>tweeting that she was in contact with </v>
<v Speaker 1>someone that knew somebody in Saudi </v>

105
00:05:39.610 --> 00:05:44.610
<v Speaker 1>Arabia that was outed as a secular list </v>
<v Speaker 1>or an atheist and was in trouble there.</v>

106
00:05:45.010 --> 00:05:45.843
<v Speaker 1>Life was threatened,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think by their father in your name </v>

107
00:05:48.161 --> 00:05:48.994
<v Speaker 1>then got looped into this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then this is a direct through to </v>

108
00:05:51.101 --> 00:05:51.934
<v Speaker 1>what you do@movements.org.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So can you just tell me a little bit </v>

109
00:05:54.910 --> 00:05:56.680
<v Speaker 1>about that instance?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

110
00:05:56.681 --> 00:05:58.070
<v Speaker 1>I mean that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why it's a pretty</v>

111
00:05:58.250 --> 00:06:03.250
<v Speaker 3>interesting case to say the least is </v>
<v Speaker 3>that so the man is,</v>

112
00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:06.470
<v Speaker 3>comes from Saudi Arabia and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and he,</v>

113
00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:07.333
<v Speaker 3>he also happens to be a lucky one </v>
<v Speaker 3>because he does have an American </v>

114
00:06:09.351 --> 00:06:10.184
<v Speaker 3>passport,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so he lives in the United States and he </v>

115
00:06:12.770 --> 00:06:13.603
<v Speaker 3>went to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like into a discussion with his father </v>

116
00:06:14.961 --> 00:06:19.100
<v Speaker 3>on the dinner table and he told him he </v>
<v Speaker 3>didn't even say like,</v>

117
00:06:19.101 --> 00:06:19.934
<v Speaker 3>he's an atheist.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He just said that he has some doubts </v>

118
00:06:21.771 --> 00:06:22.604
<v Speaker 3>about God and things of that sort.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the end result of that conversation </v>

119
00:06:27.531 --> 00:06:28.364
<v Speaker 3>is that his dad had threatened him that </v>
<v Speaker 3>he's going to report him to the </v>

120
00:06:30.651 --> 00:06:34.520
<v Speaker 3>authorities and that actually means in a</v>
<v Speaker 3>country like Saudi Arabia,</v>

121
00:06:34.521 --> 00:06:38.810
<v Speaker 3>which is digitally death or you're going</v>
<v Speaker 3>to get flashed like our friend Dr.</v>

122
00:06:38.811 --> 00:06:40.140
<v Speaker 3>but our,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

123
00:06:40.550 --> 00:06:42.680
<v Speaker 3>so far,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

124
00:06:42.740 --> 00:06:46.040
<v Speaker 3>he started contacting a lot of secondary</v>
<v Speaker 3>organizations.</v>

125
00:06:46.041 --> 00:06:47.750
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is my story.</v>

126
00:06:47.751 --> 00:06:48.220
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm,</v>

127
00:06:48.220 --> 00:06:50.330
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I need help and things of that sort.</v>

128
00:06:50.780 --> 00:06:55.780
<v Speaker 3>And he came across Kara and Kara made </v>
<v Speaker 3>that like she said like,</v>

129
00:06:56.930 --> 00:06:57.763
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have a friend who can have someone </v>

130
00:06:58.521 --> 00:07:01.850
<v Speaker 3>inside Arabia and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I kind of became the direct person.</v>

131
00:07:02.050 --> 00:07:02.883
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>somebody tagged me on the foot on the </v>

132
00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:08.990
<v Speaker 3>post because that's my work that I try </v>
<v Speaker 3>to help activists in closed societies.</v>

133
00:07:09.020 --> 00:07:09.853
<v Speaker 3>So basically carry tweeted something </v>
<v Speaker 3>saying I would like to help this person </v>

134
00:07:12.081 --> 00:07:14.800
<v Speaker 3>but I don't know what to do and that's </v>
<v Speaker 3>where you jumped out.</v>

135
00:07:14.900 --> 00:07:19.900
<v Speaker 3>I jumped in and I also jumped in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in trying to verify his story is true.</v>

136
00:07:20.991 --> 00:07:25.991
<v Speaker 3>And I went back and forth and </v>
<v Speaker 3>conversation with him to see a like if,</v>

137
00:07:26.030 --> 00:07:26.863
<v Speaker 3>because I mean we have tons and tons of </v>
<v Speaker 3>cases and it's very important to know </v>

138
00:07:31.281 --> 00:07:34.670
<v Speaker 3>which ones are true to case because </v>
<v Speaker 3>every case takes take long time.</v>

139
00:07:34.671 --> 00:07:37.220
<v Speaker 3>Like nothing gets solved.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I tried to make it too.</v>

140
00:07:37.230 --> 00:07:40.910
<v Speaker 3>We have a vetting system in which we </v>
<v Speaker 3>make sure that these stories are,</v>

141
00:07:40.970 --> 00:07:43.130
<v Speaker 3>are legitimate.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then so what do you do?</v>

142
00:07:43.131 --> 00:07:43.964
<v Speaker 3>Like what is the vetting system actually</v>
<v Speaker 3>entail to find out if this guy is </v>

143
00:07:46.611 --> 00:07:47.444
<v Speaker 3>actually telling the truth and not just </v>
<v Speaker 3>somebody that wants to get out of the </v>

144
00:07:49.191 --> 00:07:50.830
<v Speaker 3>country for other reasons.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

145
00:07:50.831 --> 00:07:53.870
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean somebody who is a refugee myself.</v>

146
00:07:53.930 --> 00:07:54.763
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there are certainly questions that </v>

147
00:07:56.211 --> 00:08:00.740
<v Speaker 3>somebody can know whether this like you </v>
<v Speaker 3>can ask them specific questions about,</v>

148
00:08:01.680 --> 00:08:03.040
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>about what,</v>

149
00:08:03.060 --> 00:08:06.310
<v Speaker 3>what they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what did they say to their parents and a</v>

150
00:08:06.730 --> 00:08:09.190
<v Speaker 3>weather like how is their relationship </v>
<v Speaker 3>with their parents,</v>

151
00:08:09.200 --> 00:08:10.033
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if that is actually like his dad is </v>

152
00:08:11.241 --> 00:08:12.980
<v Speaker 3>really crazy enough to report him to </v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

153
00:08:13.160 --> 00:08:13.993
<v Speaker 3>like to get his son killed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like it's a and try to see like what he </v>

154
00:08:19.141 --> 00:08:21.890
<v Speaker 3>is trying to achieve.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like why he wants to leave.</v>

155
00:08:21.900 --> 00:08:24.540
<v Speaker 3>Like what are you trying to achieve when</v>
<v Speaker 3>he wants to leave and,</v>

156
00:08:24.820 --> 00:08:25.653
<v Speaker 3>and things of that sort and try to </v>
<v Speaker 3>connect if he does no other circles and </v>

157
00:08:29.631 --> 00:08:30.464
<v Speaker 3>other friends that go through his </v>
<v Speaker 3>facebook friends and started to see if </v>

158
00:08:34.340 --> 00:08:35.173
<v Speaker 3>it says like I told this person and </v>
<v Speaker 3>tried to see if there's like the story </v>

159
00:08:37.791 --> 00:08:39.480
<v Speaker 3>matches up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

160
00:08:40.280 --> 00:08:41.330
<v Speaker 3>for this story.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

161
00:08:41.390 --> 00:08:44.750
<v Speaker 3>I admit like I always spend few hours </v>
<v Speaker 3>because it's very,</v>

162
00:08:44.870 --> 00:08:48.350
<v Speaker 3>was very emergent situation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What we did is that,</v>

163
00:08:48.860 --> 00:08:49.693
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because he got an American passport so </v>

164
00:08:50.811 --> 00:08:53.480
<v Speaker 3>there was no visa,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like there's no visa needed,</v>

165
00:08:53.690 --> 00:08:54.523
<v Speaker 3>so we crowdsourced,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we crowdfunded a money to get him to </v>

166
00:08:58.360 --> 00:08:59.730
<v Speaker 3>United States.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So like within,</v>

167
00:09:00.240 --> 00:09:02.760
<v Speaker 3>like I tell him like by,</v>
<v Speaker 3>by five,</v>

168
00:09:02.800 --> 00:09:06.150
<v Speaker 3>I think like by 5:00</v>
<v Speaker 3>AM you have to be at the airport,</v>

169
00:09:06.510 --> 00:09:07.343
<v Speaker 3>we only have like 12 hours and just make</v>
<v Speaker 3>sure that you're able to go to the </v>

170
00:09:11.371 --> 00:09:12.204
<v Speaker 3>airport and within this 12 hours I'm </v>
<v Speaker 3>going to be able to crowd fund and get </v>

171
00:09:15.541 --> 00:09:16.620
<v Speaker 3>you the ticket.</v>

172
00:09:16.920 --> 00:09:19.470
<v Speaker 3>The ticket was waiting for him at the </v>
<v Speaker 3>airport.</v>

173
00:09:19.471 --> 00:09:21.060
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And how are you communicating?</v>

174
00:09:21.061 --> 00:09:22.540
<v Speaker 3>This is done via email.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

175
00:09:22.890 --> 00:09:23.723
<v Speaker 3>in some of these clubs societies,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they use apps like whatsapp and viber </v>

176
00:09:27.631 --> 00:09:30.360
<v Speaker 3>and all of these stuff because they </v>
<v Speaker 3>cannot be controlled by the government.</v>

177
00:09:30.620 --> 00:09:31.453
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and he does seem to be a bit of tech </v>

178
00:09:34.141 --> 00:09:34.974
<v Speaker 3>savvy that he's able to use,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's call vpn that the government </v>

179
00:09:38.371 --> 00:09:40.440
<v Speaker 3>cannot track.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Whereas exact location is.</v>

180
00:09:40.830 --> 00:09:41.790
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and also,</v>

181
00:09:41.791 --> 00:09:45.090
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>here's what the crazy part about this is</v>

182
00:09:45.091 --> 00:09:45.924
<v Speaker 3>that there is another case happened </v>
<v Speaker 3>before by a gal called Hamza coach </v>

183
00:09:49.740 --> 00:09:50.573
<v Speaker 3>Carter,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and he also came out as an atheist and </v>

184
00:09:52.741 --> 00:09:53.574
<v Speaker 3>he escaped in Malaysia,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is so called moderate Muslim </v>

185
00:09:55.801 --> 00:09:56.634
<v Speaker 3>country and the Saudi government </v>
<v Speaker 3>contacted the Interpol and got him out </v>

186
00:10:01.021 --> 00:10:02.820
<v Speaker 3>of the airport there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So Interpol,</v>

187
00:10:02.821 --> 00:10:03.654
<v Speaker 3>which is a national or international </v>
<v Speaker 3>position to defend human rights and all </v>

188
00:10:07.831 --> 00:10:08.664
<v Speaker 3>of that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they stopped him and get him back to </v>

189
00:10:10.501 --> 00:10:11.190
<v Speaker 3>Saudi Arabia.</v>

190
00:10:11.190 --> 00:10:14.100
<v Speaker 3>So this guy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because he got an American citizenship,</v>

191
00:10:14.340 --> 00:10:19.340
<v Speaker 3>Kinda helps in getting him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He went to Dubai and from why he went to</v>

192
00:10:19.351 --> 00:10:20.730
<v Speaker 3>the United States.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

193
00:10:20.940 --> 00:10:22.110
<v Speaker 3>so yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's,</v>

194
00:10:22.680 --> 00:10:23.513
<v Speaker 3>that's a now he's actually,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's in the United States and he's in </v>

195
00:10:25.801 --> 00:10:26.634
<v Speaker 3>the united.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

196
00:10:27.140 --> 00:10:29.460
<v Speaker 3>So that's a good success story.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

197
00:10:29.461 --> 00:10:30.294
<v Speaker 3>it's a good success story.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's why I wanted to jump off </v>

198
00:10:31.441 --> 00:10:34.440
<v Speaker 3>there with you because that's what you </v>
<v Speaker 3>guys do@movements.org.</v>

199
00:10:34.441 --> 00:10:35.274
<v Speaker 3>It's a perfect example of technology </v>
<v Speaker 3>meeting something that's important </v>

200
00:10:39.510 --> 00:10:40.343
<v Speaker 3>because you guys are literally raising </v>
<v Speaker 3>money to save secular people and </v>

201
00:10:44.731 --> 00:10:47.600
<v Speaker 3>atheists.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yen Not only money.</v>

202
00:10:47.610 --> 00:10:49.860
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so the whole system of movements.org,</v>

203
00:10:49.861 --> 00:10:50.694
<v Speaker 3>so we crowdsource a human rights,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so what we do is we connect activist </v>

204
00:10:54.571 --> 00:10:55.404
<v Speaker 3>from clubs,</v>
<v Speaker 3>societies to people in open societies </v>

205
00:10:57.181 --> 00:10:58.014
<v Speaker 3>who have the skills to help them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it can be somebody who's looking for </v>

206
00:11:01.651 --> 00:11:02.484
<v Speaker 3>a web designer and woman rights </v>
<v Speaker 3>activists in Afghanistan want to be </v>

207
00:11:05.071 --> 00:11:06.390
<v Speaker 3>published in the media.</v>

208
00:11:06.390 --> 00:11:08.340
<v Speaker 3>We have a partnership with the New York </v>
<v Speaker 3>Times,</v>

<v Speaker 3>We have partnership with the daily </v>

210
00:11:10.041 --> 00:11:11.160
<v Speaker 3>beast,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the Huffington Post.</v>

211
00:11:11.340 --> 00:11:12.173
<v Speaker 3>So we try to match what the activists in</v>
<v Speaker 3>this closed societies want with people </v>

212
00:11:17.071 --> 00:11:17.904
<v Speaker 3>who are on the open societies who have </v>
<v Speaker 3>the skills to help these specific </v>

213
00:11:20.221 --> 00:11:21.054
<v Speaker 3>requests.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's kind of like multi sided </v>

214
00:11:22.611 --> 00:11:25.080
<v Speaker 3>platform.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's request and that our offers.</v>

215
00:11:25.410 --> 00:11:29.550
<v Speaker 3>And then our job is just get a match.com</v>
<v Speaker 3>for four skills,</v>

216
00:11:29.600 --> 00:11:30.433
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and also have a partnership with people </v>

217
00:11:32.291 --> 00:11:33.124
<v Speaker 3>who give organization.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They'll give grants to civil rights </v>

218
00:11:34.980 --> 00:11:35.813
<v Speaker 3>organizations and things of that sort.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that's like the main concept of </v>

219
00:11:38.521 --> 00:11:39.191
<v Speaker 3>movements.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

220
00:11:39.191 --> 00:11:42.780
<v Speaker 3>So how do you guys make sure that the </v>
<v Speaker 3>network of people that you're setting up</v>

221
00:11:42.810 --> 00:11:46.800
<v Speaker 3>isn't being infiltrated either by </v>
<v Speaker 3>governments or other people that want to</v>

222
00:11:46.801 --> 00:11:48.510
<v Speaker 3>hurt these people?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

223
00:11:48.511 --> 00:11:49.344
<v Speaker 3>I mean what I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's very impossible to have 100 </v>

224
00:11:52.990 --> 00:11:53.860
<v Speaker 3>percent secure system.</v>

225
00:11:53.860 --> 00:11:55.540
<v Speaker 3>So I'm going to be very honest about </v>
<v Speaker 3>this.</v>

226
00:11:55.541 --> 00:11:57.880
<v Speaker 3>I mean even facebook and Google and all </v>
<v Speaker 3>of these,</v>

227
00:11:58.120 --> 00:11:58.953
<v Speaker 3>but we.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So we have a vetting system in which </v>

228
00:12:00.820 --> 00:12:01.653
<v Speaker 3>these people who sign up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we ask them to put as much information </v>

229
00:12:05.591 --> 00:12:08.620
<v Speaker 3>as possible to be able for us to be able</v>
<v Speaker 3>to verify this information.</v>

230
00:12:09.220 --> 00:12:13.240
<v Speaker 3>And also we asked people from closed </v>
<v Speaker 3>societies,</v>

231
00:12:13.241 --> 00:12:15.640
<v Speaker 3>and I'm going to go to the definition of</v>
<v Speaker 3>our societies afterwards,</v>

232
00:12:15.641 --> 00:12:19.050
<v Speaker 3>is that to use anonymous,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

233
00:12:19.330 --> 00:12:22.630
<v Speaker 3>names and like don't use a username that</v>
<v Speaker 3>does not reflect their,</v>

234
00:12:23.020 --> 00:12:23.853
<v Speaker 3>like their actual location or the real </v>
<v Speaker 3>name for people who are in office </v>

235
00:12:26.981 --> 00:12:28.660
<v Speaker 3>societies,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not really a big problem.</v>

236
00:12:28.661 --> 00:12:33.130
<v Speaker 3>But for people who like live in Saudi </v>
<v Speaker 3>Arabia and in Pakistan,</v>

237
00:12:33.131 --> 00:12:33.964
<v Speaker 3>in Iraq and all these places,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they would need to use a username and </v>

238
00:12:37.511 --> 00:12:40.150
<v Speaker 3>they don't give an exact.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like they don't say,</v>

239
00:12:40.300 --> 00:12:41.133
<v Speaker 3>well this is my zip code and this is my </v>
<v Speaker 3>address and folks to please come and </v>

240
00:12:45.570 --> 00:12:48.820
<v Speaker 3>save me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they can just make kind of a general</v>

241
00:12:48.821 --> 00:12:49.654
<v Speaker 3>request.</v>

242
00:12:49.750 --> 00:12:50.583
<v Speaker 3>And then within the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>within the messaging service that we </v>

243
00:12:52.631 --> 00:12:53.464
<v Speaker 3>have,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they can reveal some of the information </v>

244
00:12:55.660 --> 00:12:58.210
<v Speaker 3>and we also have a very strong security </v>
<v Speaker 3>in terms of,</v>

245
00:12:58.470 --> 00:13:01.060
<v Speaker 3>of people trying to hock and things of </v>
<v Speaker 3>that sort.</v>

246
00:13:01.061 --> 00:13:04.510
<v Speaker 3>And the organization started as a result</v>
<v Speaker 3>of funding from Google.</v>

247
00:13:04.511 --> 00:13:08.080
<v Speaker 3>So we get that kind of saved in terms of</v>
<v Speaker 3>security.</v>

248
00:13:08.081 --> 00:13:11.080
<v Speaker 3>We don't have a problem of like big </v>
<v Speaker 3>hacking and uh,</v>

249
00:13:11.860 --> 00:13:12.820
<v Speaker 3>but yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean it is,</v>

250
00:13:12.880 --> 00:13:13.713
<v Speaker 3>it is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's obviously a possibility that many </v>

251
00:13:16.091 --> 00:13:18.820
<v Speaker 3>of these governments,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whether it's Iran or Saudi Arabia,</v>

252
00:13:18.821 --> 00:13:21.700
<v Speaker 3>would you try to use a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

253
00:13:21.940 --> 00:13:25.990
<v Speaker 3>but we can track whether they're tried </v>
<v Speaker 3>to message people and tell them like,</v>

254
00:13:25.991 --> 00:13:27.550
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what you guys do and things like that.</v>

255
00:13:27.551 --> 00:13:31.600
<v Speaker 3>So also we have the star rating system.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So for every user,</v>

256
00:13:32.560 --> 00:13:35.140
<v Speaker 3>no matter how much we've verified that </v>
<v Speaker 3>information,</v>

257
00:13:35.141 --> 00:13:38.650
<v Speaker 3>we put them on a star rating system from</v>
<v Speaker 3>like zero stars to five stars.</v>

258
00:13:38.650 --> 00:13:39.483
<v Speaker 3>So we ask people a few,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you get messaged by somebody got zero </v>

259
00:13:42.641 --> 00:13:44.710
<v Speaker 3>stars,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you this person,</v>

260
00:13:44.711 --> 00:13:45.910
<v Speaker 3>watch out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>watch out,</v>

261
00:13:45.970 --> 00:13:46.803
<v Speaker 3>and if it's five stars like people like </v>
<v Speaker 3>the New York Times or having linkedin </v>

262
00:13:49.630 --> 00:13:51.280
<v Speaker 3>post.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that's.</v>

263
00:13:51.430 --> 00:13:52.850
<v Speaker 3>So we,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's,</v>

264
00:13:52.900 --> 00:13:56.830
<v Speaker 3>it is dependent on the user and we also </v>
<v Speaker 3>tried to make them cautious that they,</v>

265
00:13:57.300 --> 00:13:58.420
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but as I said,</v>

266
00:13:58.421 --> 00:13:59.620
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you cannot prevent,</v>

267
00:14:00.050 --> 00:14:00.883
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all types of attacks from this </v>

268
00:14:03.250 --> 00:14:04.630
<v Speaker 3>authoritarian governments.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sure,</v>

269
00:14:04.631 --> 00:14:05.464
<v Speaker 3>sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I want to talk more about the </v>

270
00:14:05.831 --> 00:14:06.664
<v Speaker 3>authoritarian governance,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but a little bit more about your work </v>

271
00:14:08.081 --> 00:14:08.914
<v Speaker 3>first.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How much is actually just trying to get </v>

272
00:14:11.110 --> 00:14:11.943
<v Speaker 3>these people out versus connecting them </v>
<v Speaker 3>with people in the closed society so </v>

273
00:14:15.911 --> 00:14:18.550
<v Speaker 3>that they can actually change their </v>
<v Speaker 3>societies from within.</v>

274
00:14:18.760 --> 00:14:21.880
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean the fact of the matter is,</v>

275
00:14:21.881 --> 00:14:22.714
<v Speaker 3>is that many of the activists,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we have one to do change it their own </v>

276
00:14:27.041 --> 00:14:27.874
<v Speaker 3>countries.</v>

277
00:14:28.670 --> 00:14:31.360
<v Speaker 3>There is a significant amount that </v>
<v Speaker 3>actually want to get out.</v>

278
00:14:32.020 --> 00:14:36.460
<v Speaker 3>And getting out business is one of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>most difficult ones.</v>

279
00:14:36.490 --> 00:14:39.100
<v Speaker 3>And I've been somebody who's a refugee </v>
<v Speaker 3>myself.</v>

280
00:14:39.940 --> 00:14:43.210
<v Speaker 3>I had,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it took me around three years and I mean</v>

281
00:14:43.211 --> 00:14:45.730
<v Speaker 3>I left Iraq.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I went to Lebanon from Lebanon,</v>

282
00:14:45.731 --> 00:14:50.731
<v Speaker 3>I went to Malaysia and I had to wait and</v>
<v Speaker 3>then like from I left Iraq in 2009,</v>

283
00:14:51.731 --> 00:14:54.220
<v Speaker 3>I would have to United States in 2013.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's like,</v>

284
00:14:54.410 --> 00:14:57.590
<v Speaker 3>it's a four year process to actually </v>
<v Speaker 3>eventually move,</v>

285
00:14:57.591 --> 00:14:59.420
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>from a closed societies.</v>

286
00:14:59.450 --> 00:15:02.660
<v Speaker 3>So most of the refugees or the people or</v>
<v Speaker 3>trying to save their life,</v>

287
00:15:02.870 --> 00:15:05.390
<v Speaker 3>they go through like middle countries </v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

288
00:15:05.600 --> 00:15:06.433
<v Speaker 3>so because you're in your own country or</v>
<v Speaker 3>most immediate dangers of many people </v>

289
00:15:10.291 --> 00:15:11.124
<v Speaker 3>will move to that clause countries and </v>
<v Speaker 3>their farm country countries moved to </v>

290
00:15:13.551 --> 00:15:14.384
<v Speaker 3>the West.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that is extremely difficult process </v>

291
00:15:17.421 --> 00:15:19.100
<v Speaker 3>is that it's a.</v>

292
00:15:20.270 --> 00:15:23.090
<v Speaker 3>But sometimes things change.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So for example,</v>

293
00:15:23.091 --> 00:15:23.924
<v Speaker 3>one of the cases I've worked on is the </v>
<v Speaker 3>case of the Bengali bloggers and as a </v>

294
00:15:28.431 --> 00:15:31.850
<v Speaker 3>result of we help publishing them at the</v>
<v Speaker 3>daily beast.</v>

295
00:15:32.090 --> 00:15:32.923
<v Speaker 3>They were able to give that article to </v>
<v Speaker 3>the Swedish Embassy and received the </v>

296
00:15:36.021 --> 00:15:38.420
<v Speaker 3>visa as a result because they told them </v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

297
00:15:38.421 --> 00:15:40.670
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we are literally like publish it,</v>

298
00:15:40.680 --> 00:15:44.900
<v Speaker 3>the mainstream media and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and we are now in Sweden.</v>

299
00:15:44.930 --> 00:15:45.763
<v Speaker 3>So is there a risk in a case like that </v>
<v Speaker 3>where these bloggers are writing in </v>

300
00:15:48.351 --> 00:15:49.184
<v Speaker 3>Bangladesh where we know people are </v>
<v Speaker 3>being killed for this just in the last </v>

301
00:15:51.890 --> 00:15:53.850
<v Speaker 3>two weeks,</v>
<v Speaker 3>several people killed.</v>

302
00:15:54.110 --> 00:15:54.943
<v Speaker 3>Is there a risk that when you guys go </v>
<v Speaker 3>ahead and publish that either on daily </v>

303
00:15:57.441 --> 00:15:58.760
<v Speaker 3>beast or Huffington post or wherever it </v>
<v Speaker 3>is,</v>

304
00:15:59.090 --> 00:15:59.923
<v Speaker 3>that that brings more attention to it so</v>
<v Speaker 3>that suddenly there's this new crop of </v>

305
00:16:02.721 --> 00:16:05.960
<v Speaker 3>people that didn't even know about it </v>
<v Speaker 3>that now now wants to kill them?</v>

306
00:16:06.130 --> 00:16:07.520
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wouldn't think so.</v>

307
00:16:07.521 --> 00:16:08.810
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean as they say,</v>

308
00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:12.650
<v Speaker 3>there is no such thing as half pregnant.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're either pregnant or not.</v>

309
00:16:12.990 --> 00:16:14.930
<v Speaker 3>Is that when,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you.</v>

310
00:16:15.060 --> 00:16:19.490
<v Speaker 3>I mean they're like a recent tweet by a </v>
<v Speaker 3>group called Ansara Islam,</v>

311
00:16:19.491 --> 00:16:20.324
<v Speaker 3>which is the Al Qaeda affiliate in </v>
<v Speaker 3>Southeast Asia and they actually </v>

312
00:16:24.260 --> 00:16:27.140
<v Speaker 3>published all the names of the bloggers </v>
<v Speaker 3>ask like.</v>

313
00:16:27.500 --> 00:16:30.430
<v Speaker 3>So they actually stole our idea that </v>
<v Speaker 3>crowdsourcing terrorism.</v>

314
00:16:30.460 --> 00:16:32.320
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So they like,</v>

315
00:16:32.390 --> 00:16:34.780
<v Speaker 3>it's the reverse.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If they got something,</v>

316
00:16:34.810 --> 00:16:35.643
<v Speaker 3>I got something there and they are </v>
<v Speaker 3>crowdsourcing terrorism is that these </v>

317
00:16:38.541 --> 00:16:40.810
<v Speaker 3>are the names of the bloggers and this </v>
<v Speaker 3>and you should.</v>

318
00:16:41.080 --> 00:16:43.550
<v Speaker 3>It's open source to everybody who wants </v>
<v Speaker 3>to go and kill them.</v>

319
00:16:43.551 --> 00:16:46.170
<v Speaker 3>So many of us,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's,</v>

320
00:16:46.270 --> 00:16:48.050
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're already under threat,</v>

321
00:16:48.110 --> 00:16:48.943
<v Speaker 3>so people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when actually it's kind of helpful like </v>

322
00:16:52.170 --> 00:16:52.800
<v Speaker 3>this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

323
00:16:52.800 --> 00:16:53.633
<v Speaker 3>back to my case is that it helped me </v>
<v Speaker 3>that I was published in the mainstream </v>

324
00:16:57.111 --> 00:17:02.111
<v Speaker 3>media in terms of getting known and it </v>
<v Speaker 3>will be easy for me to get a visa.</v>

325
00:17:03.140 --> 00:17:06.290
<v Speaker 3>So if you are only published within </v>
<v Speaker 3>local news media,</v>

326
00:17:06.350 --> 00:17:10.760
<v Speaker 3>most of the people who like know about,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like the lawyers and the staff will not,</v>

327
00:17:10.761 --> 00:17:12.260
<v Speaker 3>will discount that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They will say like,</v>

328
00:17:12.440 --> 00:17:13.273
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we need something,</v>

329
00:17:13.290 --> 00:17:16.770
<v Speaker 3>we can show it to American authorities,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like they don't understand Bengali or,</v>

330
00:17:16.960 --> 00:17:18.500
<v Speaker 3>or do any of that sort.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

331
00:17:18.860 --> 00:17:19.693
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so it is helpful to get published like </v>

332
00:17:23.150 --> 00:17:23.983
<v Speaker 3>mainstream American media and all these </v>
<v Speaker 3>writers in La that just want to get </v>

333
00:17:27.381 --> 00:17:28.214
<v Speaker 3>published for.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So they get picked up by an agent and </v>

334
00:17:30.021 --> 00:17:32.060
<v Speaker 3>you're dealing with the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're just by,</v>

335
00:17:32.090 --> 00:17:33.290
<v Speaker 3>by language.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

336
00:17:33.320 --> 00:17:35.130
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And and Mac,</v>

337
00:17:35.190 --> 00:17:38.600
<v Speaker 3>the concept of crowdsourcing is like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so like in the case of Bengali,</v>

338
00:17:38.680 --> 00:17:39.513
<v Speaker 3>so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so he said they send this article in </v>

339
00:17:41.030 --> 00:17:44.390
<v Speaker 3>Bengali and there is another person </v>
<v Speaker 3>translated Dr.</v>

340
00:17:44.480 --> 00:17:49.480
<v Speaker 3>color from Bengali to English and there </v>
<v Speaker 3>was another person as is article and all</v>

341
00:17:49.561 --> 00:17:50.394
<v Speaker 3>these people don't know each other,</v>
<v Speaker 3>everybody has a certain skill and then </v>

342
00:17:53.041 --> 00:17:53.880
<v Speaker 3>there's the publisher.</v>

343
00:17:53.880 --> 00:17:56.730
<v Speaker 3>So these three people work together and </v>
<v Speaker 3>they don't know each other,</v>

344
00:17:57.150 --> 00:17:57.983
<v Speaker 3>help publishing the article and that </v>
<v Speaker 3>helped that getting somebody out to </v>

345
00:18:01.411 --> 00:18:02.191
<v Speaker 3>Sweden.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So.</v>

346
00:18:02.191 --> 00:18:04.790
<v Speaker 3>So that is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that's the concept of crowdsourcing.</v>

347
00:18:04.800 --> 00:18:08.730
<v Speaker 3>Like everybody has a skill that they can</v>
<v Speaker 3>contribute collectively to great.</v>

348
00:18:08.731 --> 00:18:09.750
<v Speaker 3>A great result.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

349
00:18:09.751 --> 00:18:12.390
<v Speaker 3>So that's the beauty of it because </v>
<v Speaker 3>people think of crowd funding and when I</v>

350
00:18:12.391 --> 00:18:13.830
<v Speaker 3>first went to the site and I was looking</v>
<v Speaker 3>around,</v>

351
00:18:14.010 --> 00:18:15.450
<v Speaker 3>I thought it was really just going to be</v>
<v Speaker 3>about money,</v>

352
00:18:15.451 --> 00:18:16.284
<v Speaker 3>like we're trying to raise x amount of </v>
<v Speaker 3>dollars to get this person out of this </v>

353
00:18:19.201 --> 00:18:20.034
<v Speaker 3>country.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But really it's about the skill set and </v>

354
00:18:22.111 --> 00:18:24.960
<v Speaker 3>linking people that otherwise couldn't </v>
<v Speaker 3>find each other.</v>

355
00:18:25.050 --> 00:18:25.950
<v Speaker 3>I for,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for,</v>

356
00:18:26.360 --> 00:18:29.100
<v Speaker 3>for a case like we talked about in our </v>
<v Speaker 3>Saudi Arabia,</v>

357
00:18:29.101 --> 00:18:31.650
<v Speaker 3>we like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so we depended on partnerships,</v>

358
00:18:31.651 --> 00:18:33.180
<v Speaker 3>we're not actually the ones doing the </v>
<v Speaker 3>job,</v>

359
00:18:33.210 --> 00:18:36.780
<v Speaker 3>but we could have the platform in which </v>
<v Speaker 3>all these people work together.</v>

360
00:18:36.780 --> 00:18:37.613
<v Speaker 3>So the organization that did the crowd </v>
<v Speaker 3>funding was called recovery from </v>

361
00:18:40.651 --> 00:18:42.150
<v Speaker 3>religion,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is like a,</v>

362
00:18:42.780 --> 00:18:46.050
<v Speaker 3>I think in Kansas or somewhere in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>midwest.</v>

363
00:18:46.070 --> 00:18:46.950
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and uh,</v>

364
00:18:47.210 --> 00:18:51.000
<v Speaker 3>there is the funds there and so all of </v>
<v Speaker 3>us are connected together,</v>

365
00:18:51.180 --> 00:18:54.720
<v Speaker 3>so the funds go to their and their users</v>
<v Speaker 3>from movements and.</v>

366
00:18:54.900 --> 00:18:55.733
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's like a circle of people working </v>

367
00:18:57.211 --> 00:18:58.710
<v Speaker 3>together to get somebody out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

368
00:18:58.711 --> 00:19:01.110
<v Speaker 3>it's incredible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So in a case like this,</v>

369
00:19:01.111 --> 00:19:04.650
<v Speaker 3>like this one that we're talking about </v>
<v Speaker 3>with Saudi Arabia where he had a.</v>

370
00:19:04.840 --> 00:19:08.040
<v Speaker 3>So he had an American passport.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you had an actual American passport.</v>

371
00:19:08.850 --> 00:19:09.683
<v Speaker 3>Is this a case,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like why can't they just go to the </v>

372
00:19:10.981 --> 00:19:13.320
<v Speaker 3>embassy then?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why was he afraid to actually just go to</v>

373
00:19:13.321 --> 00:19:15.030
<v Speaker 3>the American embassy?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

374
00:19:15.031 --> 00:19:16.680
<v Speaker 3>Saudi Arabia is supposed to be our big </v>
<v Speaker 3>ally,</v>

375
00:19:16.681 --> 00:19:17.580
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

376
00:19:17.670 --> 00:19:18.900
<v Speaker 3>That's what these guys.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sure.</v>

377
00:19:18.901 --> 00:19:20.760
<v Speaker 3>Women can vote and all and can't drive.</v>

378
00:19:20.760 --> 00:19:22.810
<v Speaker 3>But I'm not sure what the ally ward </v>
<v Speaker 3>here.</v>

379
00:19:22.840 --> 00:19:24.780
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So why,</v>

380
00:19:24.810 --> 00:19:29.040
<v Speaker 3>what would be the fear though of going </v>
<v Speaker 3>to the US embassy and claiming asylum or</v>

381
00:19:29.041 --> 00:19:30.690
<v Speaker 3>something like that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

382
00:19:30.691 --> 00:19:31.630
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

383
00:19:32.040 --> 00:19:32.873
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think that the embassies give a </v>

384
00:19:36.070 --> 00:19:38.370
<v Speaker 3>protections because he's like a Saudi </v>
<v Speaker 3>citizen,</v>

385
00:19:38.371 --> 00:19:41.520
<v Speaker 3>an American citizen at the same time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And um,</v>

386
00:19:42.750 --> 00:19:44.790
<v Speaker 3>I mean sometimes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean even the,</v>

387
00:19:45.140 --> 00:19:50.140
<v Speaker 3>these cases of like other other folks,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the US embassy doesn't seem to give that</v>

388
00:19:51.091 --> 00:19:53.910
<v Speaker 3>much protection of from people </v>
<v Speaker 3>persecuted by,</v>

389
00:19:53.911 --> 00:19:56.070
<v Speaker 3>as you said allies because allies,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

390
00:19:56.071 --> 00:19:57.940
<v Speaker 3>So yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that's what it creates attention.</v>

391
00:19:58.100 --> 00:19:58.933
<v Speaker 3>So it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

392
00:19:58.950 --> 00:19:59.783
<v Speaker 3>it was a better for him,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean just to leave the country and go </v>

393
00:20:03.661 --> 00:20:04.494
<v Speaker 3>to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to say to the United States other than </v>

394
00:20:07.350 --> 00:20:08.183
<v Speaker 3>get a safe haven and he,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean even if going to go to the US </v>

395
00:20:11.101 --> 00:20:12.990
<v Speaker 3>embassy is gonna still be in Saudi </v>
<v Speaker 3>Arabia.</v>

396
00:20:12.990 --> 00:20:16.950
<v Speaker 3>So you're going to still be stuck inside</v>
<v Speaker 3>the embassy.</v>

397
00:20:17.010 --> 00:20:18.690
<v Speaker 3>Do you have like a list of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>countries?</v>

398
00:20:18.691 --> 00:20:19.524
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure there's a master list of </v>

399
00:20:20.011 --> 00:20:22.290
<v Speaker 3>countries that are close to you guys </v>
<v Speaker 3>call them,</v>

400
00:20:22.530 --> 00:20:23.363
<v Speaker 3>but what are the countries that are </v>
<v Speaker 3>really the most impossible for the </v>

401
00:20:26.611 --> 00:20:30.470
<v Speaker 3>secular released or the free thinker or </v>
<v Speaker 3>the atheists are all that yo?</v>

402
00:20:30.480 --> 00:20:31.050
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

403
00:20:31.050 --> 00:20:33.190
<v Speaker 3>what we depend on the definition of free</v>
<v Speaker 3>society.</v>

404
00:20:33.200 --> 00:20:35.640
<v Speaker 3>Our society come from an organization </v>
<v Speaker 3>called Freedom House,</v>

405
00:20:35.850 --> 00:20:38.850
<v Speaker 3>so freedom house trucks,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all the countries in terms of freedom of</v>

406
00:20:38.851 --> 00:20:40.080
<v Speaker 3>expression,</v>
<v Speaker 3>freedom of press,</v>

407
00:20:40.081 --> 00:20:40.914
<v Speaker 3>freedom of association.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So they have like all the countries and </v>

408
00:20:43.411 --> 00:20:48.340
<v Speaker 3>they're trying to put a try to do </v>
<v Speaker 3>reports on a basis to see which ones get</v>

409
00:20:48.341 --> 00:20:49.600
<v Speaker 3>advised.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So which one got worse?</v>

410
00:20:49.900 --> 00:20:51.760
<v Speaker 3>So I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when it comes to the worst,</v>

411
00:20:51.761 --> 00:20:54.490
<v Speaker 3>I mean our to put Saudi Arabia as the </v>
<v Speaker 3>worst.</v>

412
00:20:54.930 --> 00:20:56.700
<v Speaker 3>I get our allies,</v>
<v Speaker 3>our,</v>

413
00:20:56.760 --> 00:20:57.490
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>our,</v>

414
00:20:57.490 --> 00:21:02.490
<v Speaker 3>our favorite ally,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Saudi Arabia and Pakistan and Iran.</v>

415
00:21:03.070 --> 00:21:05.200
<v Speaker 3>I mean that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I call them the axis of evil.</v>

416
00:21:05.230 --> 00:21:07.060
<v Speaker 3>But uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so that's an.</v>

417
00:21:07.150 --> 00:21:08.890
<v Speaker 3>I mean obviously North Korea,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that's,</v>

418
00:21:09.010 --> 00:21:10.450
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

419
00:21:10.451 --> 00:21:11.284
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean being anything in North Korea is </v>

420
00:21:13.451 --> 00:21:14.284
<v Speaker 3>a problem.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Whether that being a believer in the </v>

421
00:21:16.270 --> 00:21:19.150
<v Speaker 3>supreme leader of the leader of North </v>
<v Speaker 3>Korea.</v>

422
00:21:19.151 --> 00:21:19.984
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so North Korea is probably like the </v>

423
00:21:22.360 --> 00:21:23.193
<v Speaker 3>closest yet society we know we know of </v>
<v Speaker 3>at the moment and I think there's a </v>

424
00:21:27.370 --> 00:21:31.540
<v Speaker 3>Tajik start talking about Stan in </v>
<v Speaker 3>Central Asia and uh,</v>

425
00:21:31.860 --> 00:21:32.693
<v Speaker 3>this is kind of like the most difficult </v>
<v Speaker 3>and also it depends on the strength of </v>

426
00:21:36.450 --> 00:21:38.050
<v Speaker 3>there's something called strength of the</v>
<v Speaker 3>passport.</v>

427
00:21:38.051 --> 00:21:38.884
<v Speaker 3>So like for example,</v>
<v Speaker 3>me as somebody who was an Iraqi Iraqi </v>

428
00:21:40.661 --> 00:21:41.494
<v Speaker 3>passport doesn't get me anywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like there are only few countries that </v>

429
00:21:43.991 --> 00:21:47.590
<v Speaker 3>get me in without a visa and that's the </v>
<v Speaker 3>countries I went to Lebanon in Malaysia,</v>

430
00:21:47.591 --> 00:21:48.424
<v Speaker 3>like when I applied to United Kingdom </v>
<v Speaker 3>they rejected me saying that they </v>

431
00:21:50.531 --> 00:21:51.364
<v Speaker 3>require like thousands of pounds in my </v>
<v Speaker 3>savings account and touch for six </v>

432
00:21:54.521 --> 00:21:55.210
<v Speaker 3>months.</v>

433
00:21:55.210 --> 00:21:56.043
<v Speaker 3>So yeah really.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's very difficult for countries </v>

434
00:22:00.310 --> 00:22:01.660
<v Speaker 3>that have,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

435
00:22:01.740 --> 00:22:02.573
<v Speaker 3>They required a lot of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like they require a visa for every </v>

436
00:22:04.331 --> 00:22:06.970
<v Speaker 3>country they go to a to leave that </v>
<v Speaker 3>country.</v>

437
00:22:06.971 --> 00:22:07.804
<v Speaker 3>But,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but for countries like which are in the </v>

438
00:22:09.731 --> 00:22:10.564
<v Speaker 3>Gulf region,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sometimes it's easier for them to get a </v>

439
00:22:13.391 --> 00:22:15.760
<v Speaker 3>visa elsewhere.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So there's,</v>

440
00:22:15.950 --> 00:22:18.820
<v Speaker 3>the passport also plays a role in how to</v>
<v Speaker 3>get people out.</v>

441
00:22:18.910 --> 00:22:19.391
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All right,</v>

442
00:22:19.391 --> 00:22:21.070
<v Speaker 3>well that's a perfect segue to your </v>
<v Speaker 3>story,</v>

443
00:22:21.071 --> 00:22:22.720
<v Speaker 3>which is pretty great.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you grew up,</v>

444
00:22:22.721 --> 00:22:24.050
<v Speaker 3>you were born,</v>
<v Speaker 3>interact and grew up in.</v>

445
00:22:24.140 --> 00:22:25.050
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

446
00:22:25.060 --> 00:22:29.250
<v Speaker 3>I guess we could now be referred to as </v>
<v Speaker 3>the good old days under Saddam Hussein.</v>

447
00:22:29.360 --> 00:22:32.430
<v Speaker 3>I think of them as the good old days </v>
<v Speaker 3>kind of know right now.</v>

448
00:22:32.770 --> 00:22:33.750
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

449
00:22:33.950 --> 00:22:36.880
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's surely,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean necessarily to use the word,</v>

450
00:22:36.881 --> 00:22:39.650
<v Speaker 3>it's like it's a cluster fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm his dad.</v>

451
00:22:39.900 --> 00:22:40.330
<v Speaker 3>It's okay.</v>

452
00:22:40.330 --> 00:22:41.163
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean I'm living at a living under </v>

453
00:22:43.961 --> 00:22:47.350
<v Speaker 3>Saddam Hussein was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>was not really great.</v>

454
00:22:47.400 --> 00:22:48.233
<v Speaker 3>I mean a w plus I was living under the </v>
<v Speaker 3>sanctions when Saddam Hussein was the </v>

455
00:22:51.671 --> 00:22:53.410
<v Speaker 3>president.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it was two things.</v>

456
00:22:53.480 --> 00:22:55.900
<v Speaker 3>Those are two separate.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You had the regime itself?</v>

457
00:22:55.930 --> 00:22:56.561
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The regime.</v>

458
00:22:56.561 --> 00:22:57.394
<v Speaker 3>And you had the sanctioned,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sanctioned by the US and UK and </v>

459
00:22:59.621 --> 00:23:00.454
<v Speaker 3>everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

460
00:23:00.610 --> 00:23:05.230
<v Speaker 3>And I mean it's literally a prison </v>
<v Speaker 3>living.</v>

461
00:23:06.370 --> 00:23:07.203
<v Speaker 3>What was it like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

462
00:23:07.240 --> 00:23:09.700
<v Speaker 3>on any given day you're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're 13 years old,</v>

463
00:23:09.701 --> 00:23:11.080
<v Speaker 3>what was it like?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

464
00:23:11.081 --> 00:23:11.620
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

465
00:23:11.620 --> 00:23:14.110
<v Speaker 3>I mean you see his pictures everywhere </v>
<v Speaker 3>and you have to,</v>

466
00:23:14.111 --> 00:23:14.944
<v Speaker 3>like when,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you go to classroom elementary </v>

467
00:23:16.301 --> 00:23:17.134
<v Speaker 3>school,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you'll have to stand up and say long </v>

468
00:23:18.431 --> 00:23:19.510
<v Speaker 3>lifts.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Saddam Hussein,</v>

469
00:23:20.090 --> 00:23:20.923
<v Speaker 3>when nine slash 11 happened,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he declared a holiday in the schools in </v>

470
00:23:23.891 --> 00:23:24.724
<v Speaker 3>which my school was like praising the </v>
<v Speaker 3>mujaheddin did nine slash 11 because he </v>

471
00:23:29.501 --> 00:23:31.870
<v Speaker 3>started like the faith campaign after </v>
<v Speaker 3>the Gulf War.</v>

472
00:23:32.260 --> 00:23:33.093
<v Speaker 3>That's what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a lot of confusion in which </v>

473
00:23:34.061 --> 00:23:34.894
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they conserve Saddam Hussein to be a </v>

474
00:23:35.801 --> 00:23:38.560
<v Speaker 3>secularist.</v>
<v Speaker 3>His secular as compared to isis.</v>

475
00:23:38.561 --> 00:23:43.561
<v Speaker 3>But that doesn't say much like probably </v>
<v Speaker 3>al-Qaeda's secular comfort diocese.</v>

476
00:23:45.590 --> 00:23:47.920
<v Speaker 3>Was He really,</v>
<v Speaker 3>was he just using religion or was,</v>

477
00:23:47.930 --> 00:23:50.600
<v Speaker 3>did you think he actually believed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

478
00:23:50.601 --> 00:23:51.830
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

479
00:23:52.100 --> 00:23:52.940
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't,</v>

480
00:23:52.941 --> 00:23:56.080
<v Speaker 3>I mean I'm not really good in </v>
<v Speaker 3>psychoanalysis but um,</v>

481
00:23:56.810 --> 00:24:01.550
<v Speaker 3>I think that regardless of whether he </v>
<v Speaker 3>was using it for his own benefit is like</v>

482
00:24:01.551 --> 00:24:03.260
<v Speaker 3>Iraq as secular as a.</v>
<v Speaker 3>sorry,</v>

483
00:24:03.340 --> 00:24:04.173
<v Speaker 3>a just society.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So using religion is definitely a </v>

484
00:24:06.611 --> 00:24:07.444
<v Speaker 3>beneficial to all of the people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It cannot use religion to Sweden for </v>

485
00:24:09.891 --> 00:24:12.900
<v Speaker 3>example,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you're definitely able to use it.</v>

486
00:24:12.910 --> 00:24:15.830
<v Speaker 3>Plus,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he built a lot of mosques and uh,</v>

487
00:24:15.860 --> 00:24:19.490
<v Speaker 3>and he was um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>also,</v>

488
00:24:19.491 --> 00:24:19.850
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

489
00:24:19.850 --> 00:24:20.683
<v Speaker 3>I mean since the Gulf War,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean he started waging jihad against </v>

490
00:24:24.080 --> 00:24:24.913
<v Speaker 3>the west and he start bringing people </v>
<v Speaker 3>like almost opposite became the leader </v>

491
00:24:30.141 --> 00:24:34.430
<v Speaker 3>of al Qaeda and was he came to Iraq and </v>
<v Speaker 3>to like before the war.</v>

492
00:24:34.430 --> 00:24:36.710
<v Speaker 3>And so yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

493
00:24:36.711 --> 00:24:38.300
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so for your life though,</v>

494
00:24:38.301 --> 00:24:42.530
<v Speaker 3>so you're 13 years old and what happened</v>
<v Speaker 3>when were you having your,</v>

495
00:24:42.531 --> 00:24:45.620
<v Speaker 3>sort of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your secular awakening in yourself?</v>

496
00:24:46.010 --> 00:24:47.020
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean the,</v>

497
00:24:47.040 --> 00:24:47.873
<v Speaker 3>the lucky part of me is that I was </v>
<v Speaker 3>raised in a certain sort of liberal </v>

498
00:24:51.201 --> 00:24:52.940
<v Speaker 3>family.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I call them cafeteria Muslims.</v>

499
00:24:53.020 --> 00:24:54.890
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so my,</v>

500
00:24:55.250 --> 00:24:57.600
<v Speaker 3>my dad was like said like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

501
00:24:57.601 --> 00:25:00.910
<v Speaker 3>you can think for yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I was like,</v>

502
00:25:00.950 --> 00:25:02.750
<v Speaker 3>I was reading the Bible,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the Old Testament,</v>

503
00:25:02.751 --> 00:25:04.520
<v Speaker 3>the Torah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the Telemundo and all of this stuff.</v>

504
00:25:04.580 --> 00:25:08.840
<v Speaker 3>And all of that copy of the Talmud.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And well the Internet is,</v>

505
00:25:09.620 --> 00:25:10.453
<v Speaker 3>even though it was like the Internet,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but there are some parts that you can </v>

506
00:25:12.381 --> 00:25:13.214
<v Speaker 3>actually get online.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I've seen that all of these </v>

507
00:25:16.340 --> 00:25:19.130
<v Speaker 3>religions make objective of claims that </v>
<v Speaker 3>have them being true.</v>

508
00:25:19.460 --> 00:25:21.230
<v Speaker 3>So I said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

509
00:25:21.231 --> 00:25:22.064
<v Speaker 3>well either one of them is through or </v>
<v Speaker 3>all of them are false and I moved like </v>

510
00:25:25.760 --> 00:25:26.593
<v Speaker 3>start reading more about science and I </v>
<v Speaker 3>just realized that's probably like all </v>

511
00:25:30.081 --> 00:25:30.914
<v Speaker 3>of them are false.</v>

512
00:25:31.490 --> 00:25:32.323
<v Speaker 3>But my,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would say like my spark do activism </v>

513
00:25:34.850 --> 00:25:38.540
<v Speaker 3>came in after the war.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean when the first elections happened</v>

514
00:25:38.541 --> 00:25:43.541
<v Speaker 3>in Iraq in 2005 and I was afraid of </v>
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

515
00:25:44.301 --> 00:25:46.130
<v Speaker 3>The sheer,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when they're going to take off the power</v>

516
00:25:46.131 --> 00:25:47.070
<v Speaker 3>that Islam is a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she,</v>

517
00:25:47.071 --> 00:25:47.904
<v Speaker 3>I was going to take the power,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're going to discriminate against </v>

518
00:25:49.700 --> 00:25:52.250
<v Speaker 3>the Sundays and that would lead to a </v>
<v Speaker 3>civil war and that.</v>

519
00:25:52.251 --> 00:25:53.330
<v Speaker 3>Exactly what happened.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

520
00:25:53.600 --> 00:25:55.880
<v Speaker 3>it's very sad to be right on this </v>
<v Speaker 3>subject.</v>

521
00:25:56.150 --> 00:25:59.000
<v Speaker 3>A actually saw that coming.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You felt that?</v>

522
00:25:59.030 --> 00:26:00.860
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean it was very obvious.</v>

523
00:26:00.861 --> 00:26:01.694
<v Speaker 3>I mean the moment that Saddam Hussein </v>
<v Speaker 3>fell down the moment is when the shit </v>

524
00:26:05.180 --> 00:26:06.013
<v Speaker 3>starts getting more.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like they start getting more mobilized </v>

525
00:26:08.871 --> 00:26:09.704
<v Speaker 3>and you can see pictures of Ayatollah </v>
<v Speaker 3>Sistani and mocked up the southern and </v>

526
00:26:12.711 --> 00:26:16.070
<v Speaker 3>all of these little figures and it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>very obvious this,</v>

527
00:26:16.071 --> 00:26:17.210
<v Speaker 3>these guys are sectarian.</v>

528
00:26:17.270 --> 00:26:19.980
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I,</v>

529
00:26:20.780 --> 00:26:21.613
<v Speaker 3>I said like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well secularism is the literally the </v>

530
00:26:23.900 --> 00:26:27.740
<v Speaker 3>solution is that try to make Sunni's and</v>
<v Speaker 3>equal under the law.</v>

531
00:26:27.890 --> 00:26:30.380
<v Speaker 3>And we seen,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we seen that success happening when,</v>

532
00:26:30.650 --> 00:26:31.483
<v Speaker 3>when the first prime minister I allow,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he was a secularist when he was the </v>

533
00:26:34.731 --> 00:26:35.564
<v Speaker 3>prime minister.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There were much less sectarian warfare </v>

534
00:26:37.371 --> 00:26:38.204
<v Speaker 3>happening,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the moment where the election </v>

535
00:26:39.921 --> 00:26:43.920
<v Speaker 3>happened is when Islam as part d sharp </v>
<v Speaker 3>too one and,</v>

536
00:26:44.250 --> 00:26:45.083
<v Speaker 3>and w,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is my biggest agreement with the </v>

537
00:26:47.190 --> 00:26:49.020
<v Speaker 3>United States when it comes to you as </v>
<v Speaker 3>management of the water,</v>

538
00:26:49.021 --> 00:26:49.854
<v Speaker 3>because I always thought that there was </v>
<v Speaker 3>not qualified yet for our democracy and </v>

539
00:26:53.041 --> 00:26:53.874
<v Speaker 3>there needs to be some sort of </v>
<v Speaker 3>transitional period between building a </v>

540
00:26:57.181 --> 00:26:59.310
<v Speaker 3>secular,</v>
<v Speaker 3>secular civil society and that will take</v>

541
00:26:59.311 --> 00:27:01.470
<v Speaker 3>some time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then you created election,</v>

542
00:27:01.471 --> 00:27:02.304
<v Speaker 3>not like after 40 years of dictatorship,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you would just make people who many of </v>

543
00:27:06.631 --> 00:27:07.464
<v Speaker 3>them are illiterate,</v>
<v Speaker 3>would just go for a vote for the best </v>

544
00:27:09.601 --> 00:27:10.434
<v Speaker 3>interests of Iraq.</v>

545
00:27:10.770 --> 00:27:11.603
<v Speaker 3>So when we've seen many instances of </v>
<v Speaker 3>this as in Hamas was democratically </v>

546
00:27:15.211 --> 00:27:15.811
<v Speaker 3>elected,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

547
00:27:15.811 --> 00:27:16.670
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

548
00:27:17.280 --> 00:27:18.113
<v Speaker 3>The only example of a democratic is </v>
<v Speaker 3>another example of the majority of </v>

549
00:27:21.961 --> 00:27:24.960
<v Speaker 3>people because voted for,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for a Muslim Brotherhood.</v>

550
00:27:25.380 --> 00:27:27.270
<v Speaker 3>I mean one of the things of living under</v>
<v Speaker 3>a dictatorship,</v>

551
00:27:27.271 --> 00:27:28.104
<v Speaker 3>but what I've noticed is that </v>
<v Speaker 3>dictatorships kill everybody with </v>

552
00:27:31.081 --> 00:27:33.570
<v Speaker 3>disagree with them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So people are left out,</v>

553
00:27:34.010 --> 00:27:36.090
<v Speaker 3>are the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>are the ones who don't care about life,</v>

554
00:27:36.420 --> 00:27:37.253
<v Speaker 3>so don't care about life that jihadists.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So dictatorships for a large extent </v>

555
00:27:41.761 --> 00:27:42.594
<v Speaker 3>creates extra radical Muslims because </v>
<v Speaker 3>they kill all the moderates and they </v>

556
00:27:47.321 --> 00:27:52.321
<v Speaker 3>then give the people a false binary </v>
<v Speaker 3>system is that either you want us or you</v>

557
00:27:52.681 --> 00:27:56.190
<v Speaker 3>want the terrorists and the same thing </v>
<v Speaker 3>happening now in Syria.</v>

558
00:27:56.220 --> 00:27:57.053
<v Speaker 3>So like with Assad,</v>
<v Speaker 3>his and now with the Russian </v>

559
00:27:59.131 --> 00:28:00.900
<v Speaker 3>intervention,</v>
<v Speaker 3>most of what they're killing our,</v>

560
00:28:00.901 --> 00:28:02.670
<v Speaker 3>the moderate troubles who are in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>middle.</v>

561
00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:05.430
<v Speaker 3>So when,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when they destroy the troubles,</v>

562
00:28:05.610 --> 00:28:06.443
<v Speaker 3>they're going to give the two choices </v>
<v Speaker 3>you want us or isis and I can assure </v>

563
00:28:09.181 --> 00:28:10.590
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>most people including myself,</v>

564
00:28:10.591 --> 00:28:12.500
<v Speaker 3>would choose us.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

565
00:28:13.250 --> 00:28:14.420
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that is exempt.</v>

566
00:28:14.430 --> 00:28:15.263
<v Speaker 3>So dictatorships create extremism.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So what happens is that when these </v>

567
00:28:18.181 --> 00:28:19.014
<v Speaker 3>dictatorships have go away,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they literally created like a hostage </v>

568
00:28:21.811 --> 00:28:22.644
<v Speaker 3>crisis.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They created like a prison and you get </v>

569
00:28:24.330 --> 00:28:25.163
<v Speaker 3>out of the prison and eventually you </v>
<v Speaker 3>would have continuous sectarian warfare </v>

570
00:28:28.201 --> 00:28:29.034
<v Speaker 3>and continuous like bad politics and </v>
<v Speaker 3>America was obviously not very well </v>

571
00:28:34.771 --> 00:28:38.230
<v Speaker 3>versed and dictatorship.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There were a lot of focus on like,</v>

572
00:28:38.460 --> 00:28:39.293
<v Speaker 3>let's get rid of Saddam Hussein,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but there was very little thinking of </v>

573
00:28:42.151 --> 00:28:43.590
<v Speaker 3>what after,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is bostic Taylor.</v>

574
00:28:43.591 --> 00:28:46.650
<v Speaker 3>She was much more important than just </v>
<v Speaker 3>getting rid of the dictator.</v>

575
00:28:46.710 --> 00:28:49.290
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So where do you place or how much do you</v>

576
00:28:49.291 --> 00:28:50.124
<v Speaker 3>place the blame on the United States?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I guess at that time it was a </v>

577
00:28:53.041 --> 00:28:53.874
<v Speaker 3>coalition that or at least originally </v>
<v Speaker 3>when of course it was mostly as because </v>

578
00:28:57.751 --> 00:28:58.584
<v Speaker 3>I think most people in America now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a real sense that it was the </v>

579
00:29:00.931 --> 00:29:03.960
<v Speaker 3>wrong war to go to and they lied us into</v>
<v Speaker 3>the war and all that stuff,</v>

580
00:29:03.961 --> 00:29:04.794
<v Speaker 3>which I do it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the sense I'm getting from you is </v>

581
00:29:06.811 --> 00:29:07.644
<v Speaker 3>that there was a ton of really bad stuff</v>
<v Speaker 3>going on there anyway and a lot of it </v>

582
00:29:11.431 --> 00:29:12.690
<v Speaker 3>maybe would have bubbled up.</v>

583
00:29:12.930 --> 00:29:13.763
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

584
00:29:14.030 --> 00:29:16.260
<v Speaker 3>I mean there are so many things that </v>
<v Speaker 3>were like.</v>

585
00:29:16.450 --> 00:29:17.930
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Islamic extremism is done,</v>

586
00:29:17.950 --> 00:29:19.890
<v Speaker 3>you it didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it didn't start with,</v>

587
00:29:20.050 --> 00:29:24.040
<v Speaker 3>with the United States and then started </v>
<v Speaker 3>with the CIA or Israel or the Mossad.</v>

588
00:29:24.060 --> 00:29:28.590
<v Speaker 3>So these things have been have been </v>
<v Speaker 3>going on for hundreds of years.</v>

589
00:29:28.591 --> 00:29:29.424
<v Speaker 3>So they send their conflict.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean it started in Iraq and back at </v>

590
00:29:33.141 --> 00:29:34.000
<v Speaker 3>the time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think it was called,</v>

591
00:29:34.250 --> 00:29:37.160
<v Speaker 3>but I mean now jeff and Kabbalah is </v>
<v Speaker 3>where mom,</v>

592
00:29:37.180 --> 00:29:38.013
<v Speaker 3>Jose Hussein,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Ali were killed and that's where the </v>

593
00:29:39.211 --> 00:29:40.044
<v Speaker 3>split between the Shia I think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then fast forward to the modern </v>

594
00:29:44.561 --> 00:29:45.394
<v Speaker 3>history,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you got men empire who was at war with </v>

595
00:29:47.051 --> 00:29:51.340
<v Speaker 3>the purchase of a weekend or the Persian</v>
<v Speaker 3>empire who are the and where the sun is.</v>

596
00:29:51.490 --> 00:29:52.323
<v Speaker 3>So the conflict has been going on for </v>
<v Speaker 3>hundreds of years and all these </v>

597
00:29:54.761 --> 00:29:55.594
<v Speaker 3>dictatorships and unsustainable.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Alexa was unsustainable and America did </v>

598
00:30:00.251 --> 00:30:03.790
<v Speaker 3>not intervene in Syria until now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>recently after,</v>

599
00:30:04.090 --> 00:30:05.680
<v Speaker 3>after the Messiah came back.</v>

600
00:30:06.840 --> 00:30:09.430
<v Speaker 3>Is that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is that still.</v>

601
00:30:09.431 --> 00:30:10.264
<v Speaker 3>They still had the civil war between </v>
<v Speaker 3>Sunnis and Shias and they still had to </v>

602
00:30:13.140 --> 00:30:16.180
<v Speaker 3>isis and al Qaeda and all of that stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's,</v>

603
00:30:16.230 --> 00:30:17.140
<v Speaker 3>it's true.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

604
00:30:17.710 --> 00:30:18.543
<v Speaker 3>I never thought that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'd never think that the United States </v>

605
00:30:20.681 --> 00:30:21.514
<v Speaker 3>is the root of our problems obviously,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I think sometimes that the United </v>

606
00:30:24.700 --> 00:30:25.533
<v Speaker 3>States,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if some policies need to be applied </v>

607
00:30:28.270 --> 00:30:29.103
<v Speaker 3>based upon the understanding of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>region that kind of prevent or reduce </v>

608
00:30:32.980 --> 00:30:33.813
<v Speaker 3>amount of sectarian violence and that in</v>
<v Speaker 3>my opinion was to keep some sort of </v>

609
00:30:37.720 --> 00:30:42.580
<v Speaker 3>transitional secular regime that can </v>
<v Speaker 3>build a civil society that can reduce.</v>

610
00:30:42.581 --> 00:30:44.260
<v Speaker 3>I'm obviously it's not going to </v>
<v Speaker 3>eliminate a stickler.</v>

611
00:30:44.800 --> 00:30:45.633
<v Speaker 3>So basically.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So basically if you had had a time </v>

612
00:30:46.931 --> 00:30:47.764
<v Speaker 3>machine you would have gone back to </v>
<v Speaker 3>right around the elections when they </v>

613
00:30:50.471 --> 00:30:52.290
<v Speaker 3>finally had the free elections.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

614
00:30:52.370 --> 00:30:54.280
<v Speaker 3>And then you would have just sort of </v>
<v Speaker 3>either.</v>

615
00:30:54.310 --> 00:30:55.143
<v Speaker 3>So you would have wanted either American</v>
<v Speaker 3>troops are saying they're to stay just </v>

616
00:30:57.761 --> 00:31:01.270
<v Speaker 3>to stabilize it a little bit longer and </v>
<v Speaker 3>yet at the same time as an American,</v>

617
00:31:01.271 --> 00:31:05.470
<v Speaker 3>even though I know it's all gotten worse</v>
<v Speaker 3>in these last three years since we out,</v>

618
00:31:05.890 --> 00:31:07.780
<v Speaker 3>we didn't want to stay there either.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's.</v>

619
00:31:08.190 --> 00:31:09.023
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

620
00:31:09.150 --> 00:31:09.983
<v Speaker 3>and the thing that I always go like </v>
<v Speaker 3>conversation with neoconservatives and </v>

621
00:31:13.751 --> 00:31:16.200
<v Speaker 3>things of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of people who believe consumers,</v>

622
00:31:16.560 --> 00:31:17.393
<v Speaker 3>aggressive foreign policy is that is it </v>
<v Speaker 3>doesn't fit in with the American </v>

623
00:31:20.471 --> 00:31:22.540
<v Speaker 3>political system is like an American </v>
<v Speaker 3>political ecosystem.</v>

624
00:31:22.541 --> 00:31:25.300
<v Speaker 3>You have elections every four years and </v>
<v Speaker 3>like nation building,</v>

625
00:31:25.301 --> 00:31:27.010
<v Speaker 3>you're talking about the Middle East in </v>
<v Speaker 3>which is,</v>

626
00:31:27.280 --> 00:31:29.080
<v Speaker 3>which doesn't get done in four years.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It does.</v>

627
00:31:29.090 --> 00:31:31.420
<v Speaker 3>Obviously it doesn't get probably 40 </v>
<v Speaker 3>years,</v>

628
00:31:31.421 --> 00:31:32.254
<v Speaker 3>so.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it is unsustainable to have like a </v>

629
00:31:34.351 --> 00:31:35.184
<v Speaker 3>political system in which the president </v>
<v Speaker 3>has to change every four years and </v>

630
00:31:38.020 --> 00:31:38.853
<v Speaker 3>nation building,</v>
<v Speaker 3>especially in the region that is very </v>

631
00:31:40.691 --> 00:31:41.524
<v Speaker 3>different,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's say like Germany during World War </v>

632
00:31:43.200 --> 00:31:45.670
<v Speaker 3>Two,</v>
<v Speaker 3>after World War Two and Japan as that.</v>

633
00:31:46.180 --> 00:31:50.000
<v Speaker 3>Iraq is literally in.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It has the worst neighborhood ever have.</v>

634
00:31:50.170 --> 00:31:52.030
<v Speaker 3>You have Saudi Arabia,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is the,</v>

635
00:31:52.210 --> 00:31:53.043
<v Speaker 3>which is the rule of the Wahabi regime </v>
<v Speaker 3>that's not that different from Isis and </v>

636
00:31:57.071 --> 00:31:59.140
<v Speaker 3>you have Iran on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>on the east,</v>

637
00:31:59.470 --> 00:32:04.470
<v Speaker 3>that is the mother lode of Shia Islam </v>
<v Speaker 3>and the is in the middle between between</v>

638
00:32:07.180 --> 00:32:08.013
<v Speaker 3>and America was expecting like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so come to Iraq and create a liberal </v>

639
00:32:12.191 --> 00:32:17.191
<v Speaker 3>democracy in the middle of all regimes </v>
<v Speaker 3>that are theocratic,</v>

640
00:32:17.290 --> 00:32:19.600
<v Speaker 3>that don't believe in liberal democracy </v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

641
00:32:19.750 --> 00:32:22.150
<v Speaker 3>and one of them is an ally,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is kind of ironic,</v>

642
00:32:22.151 --> 00:32:24.760
<v Speaker 3>is like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so they try like now with the city,</v>

643
00:32:24.761 --> 00:32:28.300
<v Speaker 3>they tried to work with non democratic </v>
<v Speaker 3>countries to create a democracy.</v>

644
00:32:29.970 --> 00:32:31.930
<v Speaker 3>I mean it makes no sense.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Makes no sense.</v>

645
00:32:32.010 --> 00:32:36.900
<v Speaker 3>It's like the idea that Saudi Arabia or </v>
<v Speaker 3>Qatar or,</v>

646
00:32:36.901 --> 00:32:41.720
<v Speaker 3>or even Iran would allow a liberal </v>
<v Speaker 3>democracy to flourish in Syria and Iraq.</v>

647
00:32:41.720 --> 00:32:42.553
<v Speaker 3>It's a pure delusion.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're not that thrilled with the one </v>

648
00:32:44.331 --> 00:32:45.860
<v Speaker 3>liberal democracy that's in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>neighborhood.</v>

649
00:32:45.861 --> 00:32:46.760
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

650
00:32:46.761 --> 00:32:47.450
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

651
00:32:47.450 --> 00:32:48.720
<v Speaker 3>let's hope it stays.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

652
00:32:48.800 --> 00:32:51.170
<v Speaker 3>it seems to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Seems like Israel is going,</v>

653
00:32:51.680 --> 00:32:52.750
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean as,</v>

654
00:32:52.800 --> 00:32:53.633
<v Speaker 3>as I can see is that there's a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 3>elements of theocratic a leaderships is </v>

655
00:32:58.881 --> 00:33:00.500
<v Speaker 3>now rising up in Israel,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is,</v>

656
00:33:00.770 --> 00:33:01.603
<v Speaker 3>which may,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which I don't think I don't see Israel </v>

657
00:33:04.021 --> 00:33:04.854
<v Speaker 3>content.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean I hope it's going to continue to </v>

658
00:33:05.661 --> 00:33:06.494
<v Speaker 3>be liberal democracy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I see there are a lot of elements </v>

659
00:33:08.571 --> 00:33:10.710
<v Speaker 3>that may not be in the future.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

660
00:33:10.850 --> 00:33:11.683
<v Speaker 3>So against theocratic dictatorships and </v>
<v Speaker 3>theocratic routines regardless of </v>

661
00:33:15.831 --> 00:33:16.910
<v Speaker 3>religion.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Of course.</v>

662
00:33:18.040 --> 00:33:20.120
<v Speaker 3>A lot of people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think when I've seen,</v>

663
00:33:20.121 --> 00:33:23.260
<v Speaker 3>I've watched things with you on Youtube </v>
<v Speaker 3>where people will attack you for,</v>

664
00:33:23.440 --> 00:33:27.680
<v Speaker 3>they'll attack you being Islamophobic or</v>
<v Speaker 3>that you are attacking Islam or.</v>

665
00:33:27.681 --> 00:33:29.090
<v Speaker 3>But clearly that's not the case.</v>

666
00:33:29.090 --> 00:33:29.721
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

667
00:33:29.721 --> 00:33:33.420
<v Speaker 3>I mean the fact of the matter is like </v>
<v Speaker 3>you cannot see,</v>

668
00:33:33.440 --> 00:33:36.050
<v Speaker 3>you cannot criticize Islam and Muslim </v>
<v Speaker 3>countries.</v>

669
00:33:36.560 --> 00:33:40.580
<v Speaker 3>So even here in the west they created </v>
<v Speaker 3>some sort of like catch 22.</v>

670
00:33:40.820 --> 00:33:43.610
<v Speaker 3>So if somebody is a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as a white person,</v>

671
00:33:43.650 --> 00:33:44.483
<v Speaker 3>like somehow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So they immediately get attack him as </v>

672
00:33:46.461 --> 00:33:47.294
<v Speaker 3>cisgender white male was of interesting </v>
<v Speaker 3>to hear to from like Muslims who don't </v>

673
00:33:50.691 --> 00:33:55.310
<v Speaker 3>believe in science and so there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But if you had to,</v>

674
00:33:55.370 --> 00:33:56.203
<v Speaker 3>if somebody like me who is from the </v>
<v Speaker 3>Middle East looking to attack him as </v>

675
00:33:59.060 --> 00:34:01.370
<v Speaker 3>some sort of uncle,</v>
<v Speaker 3>tall mass murderer.</v>

676
00:34:01.520 --> 00:34:03.950
<v Speaker 3>So they kind of catch 22.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is that in,</v>

677
00:34:04.140 --> 00:34:05.450
<v Speaker 3>in the middle,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the Muslim world,</v>

678
00:34:05.451 --> 00:34:07.850
<v Speaker 3>you cannot criticize Islam and if you do</v>
<v Speaker 3>it in the West,</v>

679
00:34:08.120 --> 00:34:12.260
<v Speaker 3>you will be credited,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you will be labeled immediately as a,</v>

680
00:34:12.620 --> 00:34:15.140
<v Speaker 3>as some sort of greater as a trader.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

681
00:34:15.141 --> 00:34:17.000
<v Speaker 3>So this is an incredible thing to me.</v>

682
00:34:17.000 --> 00:34:19.700
<v Speaker 3>So I've had my new eyes on obviously.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

683
00:34:19.880 --> 00:34:20.511
<v Speaker 3>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

684
00:34:20.511 --> 00:34:21.021
<v Speaker 3>magic,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

685
00:34:21.021 --> 00:34:23.720
<v Speaker 3>I am an acknowledgement of his latest </v>
<v Speaker 3>book.</v>

686
00:34:23.721 --> 00:34:24.980
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

687
00:34:24.981 --> 00:34:25.371
<v Speaker 3>so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

688
00:34:25.371 --> 00:34:26.210
<v Speaker 3>have a little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

689
00:34:26.420 --> 00:34:29.820
<v Speaker 3>and he gets this all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He gets it more than I do.</v>

690
00:34:29.821 --> 00:34:33.800
<v Speaker 3>I think that he's a trader or he's an </v>
<v Speaker 3>uncle tom or he's a porch monkey.</v>

691
00:34:33.801 --> 00:34:35.090
<v Speaker 3>I mean these guys.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And again,</v>

692
00:34:36.140 --> 00:34:36.973
<v Speaker 3>we've talked about this a lot,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but this is coming from people on the </v>

693
00:34:38.511 --> 00:34:39.344
<v Speaker 3>left.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So what I don't understand is if you </v>

694
00:34:40.161 --> 00:34:44.570
<v Speaker 3>believe in liberal values and you want </v>
<v Speaker 3>women to be free and you want gay people</v>

695
00:34:44.571 --> 00:34:48.740
<v Speaker 3>to be free and all those things and you </v>
<v Speaker 3>want a quality for everybody,</v>

696
00:34:49.340 --> 00:34:50.173
<v Speaker 3>how do they expect to get it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>If not through people like you and </v>

697
00:34:53.281 --> 00:34:54.050
<v Speaker 3>Magid.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Forget.</v>

698
00:34:54.050 --> 00:34:55.040
<v Speaker 3>Forget Sam.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

699
00:34:55.041 --> 00:34:57.260
<v Speaker 3>They want to throw him under the bus.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What?</v>

700
00:34:58.480 --> 00:35:01.010
<v Speaker 3>He's a great guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Of course I'm not for that,</v>

701
00:35:01.530 --> 00:35:03.050
<v Speaker 3>but what I'm saying is if they want to </v>
<v Speaker 3>just remove,</v>

702
00:35:03.051 --> 00:35:05.840
<v Speaker 3>they want to use their own version of </v>
<v Speaker 3>bigotry to remove him.</v>

703
00:35:06.290 --> 00:35:07.400
<v Speaker 3>White Guy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fine.</v>

704
00:35:07.401 --> 00:35:08.234
<v Speaker 3>But then wouldn't they look at someone </v>
<v Speaker 3>like you that stands up for all those </v>

705
00:35:10.761 --> 00:35:15.050
<v Speaker 3>values on the left and say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is a guy he survived living.</v>

706
00:35:15.480 --> 00:35:16.313
<v Speaker 3>Sit down.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He now fights to make his country and </v>

707
00:35:18.771 --> 00:35:19.604
<v Speaker 3>those other countries stand up for the </v>
<v Speaker 3>very values that we as progressives say </v>

708
00:35:23.001 --> 00:35:23.834
<v Speaker 3>we're full.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And yet you don't get support out of </v>

709
00:35:25.401 --> 00:35:26.234
<v Speaker 3>these guys,</v>
<v Speaker 3>do you?</v>

710
00:35:26.620 --> 00:35:27.061
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

711
00:35:27.061 --> 00:35:28.550
<v Speaker 3>I do get some but.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I,</v>

712
00:35:28.551 --> 00:35:29.384
<v Speaker 3>I know what you're referring to is that </v>
<v Speaker 3>the regressive left as much as no one </v>

713
00:35:31.851 --> 00:35:32.481
<v Speaker 3>was.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

714
00:35:32.481 --> 00:35:33.314
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's very interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I called the unholy alliance that </v>

715
00:35:36.021 --> 00:35:41.021
<v Speaker 3>happened between the liberal left and </v>
<v Speaker 3>the Muslim rights against the,</v>

716
00:35:42.890 --> 00:35:46.140
<v Speaker 3>the or Muslim or secular left in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>Arab world.</v>

717
00:35:46.590 --> 00:35:47.423
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so ironically the secular left just to </v>

718
00:35:50.641 --> 00:35:54.420
<v Speaker 3>put that altogether,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the secular left is actually lined up in</v>

719
00:35:54.421 --> 00:35:57.240
<v Speaker 3>a weird way with the conservative,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the conservative.</v>

720
00:35:57.250 --> 00:35:59.080
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Which is very.</v>

721
00:35:59.640 --> 00:36:01.260
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it is extremely,</v>

722
00:36:01.290 --> 00:36:02.640
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean they don't,</v>

723
00:36:02.660 --> 00:36:06.210
<v Speaker 3>they don't say it very publicly,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the fact of the matter,</v>

724
00:36:06.211 --> 00:36:09.560
<v Speaker 3>I mean they apply extreme different </v>
<v Speaker 3>standards too.</v>

725
00:36:09.660 --> 00:36:10.493
<v Speaker 3>And I was speaking at UC Berkeley before</v>
<v Speaker 3>I came here and I've had some debates </v>

726
00:36:14.101 --> 00:36:16.600
<v Speaker 3>and in northern California and I told </v>
<v Speaker 3>him,</v>

727
00:36:16.601 --> 00:36:17.434
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what do you call a conservative </v>

728
00:36:18.631 --> 00:36:21.030
<v Speaker 3>Republican who is against gay marriage?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he said,</v>

729
00:36:21.031 --> 00:36:24.810
<v Speaker 3>I call him a bigot,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that he thank you for calling 90 percent</v>

730
00:36:24.811 --> 00:36:26.430
<v Speaker 3>of Muslims bigots.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They said,</v>

731
00:36:26.431 --> 00:36:27.810
<v Speaker 3>I never said that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

732
00:36:27.870 --> 00:36:28.703
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then I told him if you apply different </v>

733
00:36:31.081 --> 00:36:31.914
<v Speaker 3>standards to different people based upon</v>
<v Speaker 3>their race and because they think that </v>

734
00:36:35.251 --> 00:36:36.830
<v Speaker 3>Muslim is the brown technically,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

735
00:36:36.850 --> 00:36:38.710
<v Speaker 3>If you're not even raised,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

736
00:36:38.980 --> 00:36:40.980
<v Speaker 3>if you have a few,</v>
<v Speaker 3>apply different people,</v>

737
00:36:41.210 --> 00:36:42.780
<v Speaker 3>different sizes of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>based upon their race,</v>

738
00:36:42.781 --> 00:36:45.810
<v Speaker 3>then you are actually a racist.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And this,</v>

739
00:36:45.820 --> 00:36:49.940
<v Speaker 3>this form of racism is sometimes get </v>
<v Speaker 3>get.</v>

740
00:36:49.941 --> 00:36:52.620
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because most of the racism we talk about</v>

741
00:36:52.621 --> 00:36:53.454
<v Speaker 3>is like the KKK.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the fact of the matter is that they </v>

742
00:36:55.801 --> 00:36:57.180
<v Speaker 3>agree.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So like when,</v>

743
00:36:57.210 --> 00:36:58.800
<v Speaker 3>when somebody like the Charleston </v>
<v Speaker 3>shooting,</v>

744
00:36:58.801 --> 00:37:03.120
<v Speaker 3>the one habit in South Carolina is that </v>
<v Speaker 3>the guy said I'm motivated by racism,</v>

745
00:37:03.150 --> 00:37:05.980
<v Speaker 3>and they immediately took him for his </v>
<v Speaker 3>word and they're true.</v>

746
00:37:06.450 --> 00:37:07.283
<v Speaker 3>They're right there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's this guy who was motivated by </v>

747
00:37:08.551 --> 00:37:12.330
<v Speaker 3>racism but replace,</v>
<v Speaker 3>replace this guy by Isis.</v>

748
00:37:12.840 --> 00:37:13.673
<v Speaker 3>And Isis says,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I am literally motivated by this </v>

749
00:37:16.501 --> 00:37:17.334
<v Speaker 3>interpretation of Islam.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The same guys who said that this game </v>

750
00:37:19.861 --> 00:37:21.180
<v Speaker 3>was believable.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Racism will say,</v>

751
00:37:21.181 --> 00:37:21.691
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

752
00:37:21.691 --> 00:37:23.590
<v Speaker 3>this thing has ulterior motives,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

753
00:37:23.710 --> 00:37:26.910
<v Speaker 3>It must be avoided.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Economics and foreign policy or politics</v>

754
00:37:26.940 --> 00:37:29.940
<v Speaker 3>and George W Bush and Dick Cheney and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and the Olympian,</v>

755
00:37:29.980 --> 00:37:30.813
<v Speaker 3>older,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they create the solid of everybody they </v>

756
00:37:32.341 --> 00:37:34.410
<v Speaker 3>hate and they put him in one category.</v>

757
00:37:34.500 --> 00:37:37.910
<v Speaker 3>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so you see like the double standards,</v>

758
00:37:37.920 --> 00:37:39.950
<v Speaker 3>extremely obvious.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>

759
00:37:40.290 --> 00:37:41.123
<v Speaker 3>so as a result of that they can,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you created a smokescreen for apologist </v>

760
00:37:45.751 --> 00:37:46.341
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

761
00:37:46.341 --> 00:37:47.174
<v Speaker 3>and even extremists to flourish in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in like people like me have to fight </v>

762
00:37:51.331 --> 00:37:55.530
<v Speaker 3>against the religious right and the far </v>
<v Speaker 3>right in the United States who,</v>

763
00:37:55.630 --> 00:37:58.830
<v Speaker 3>who consider me like inferior human </v>
<v Speaker 3>being,</v>

764
00:37:58.970 --> 00:38:01.410
<v Speaker 3>right and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and yeah,</v>

765
00:38:01.460 --> 00:38:04.320
<v Speaker 3>and have to fight the religious right in</v>
<v Speaker 3>my own country.</v>

766
00:38:04.321 --> 00:38:05.220
<v Speaker 3>That was lovely,</v>
<v Speaker 3>cried.</v>

767
00:38:05.250 --> 00:38:07.590
<v Speaker 3>And then I have to find the apologists </v>
<v Speaker 3>left.</v>

768
00:38:07.860 --> 00:38:11.970
<v Speaker 3>So like they created extra France for </v>
<v Speaker 3>and they,</v>

769
00:38:12.570 --> 00:38:13.403
<v Speaker 3>they have made it very much,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very much difficult for people like </v>

770
00:38:16.561 --> 00:38:17.394
<v Speaker 3>Majid Nawaz and many people who are </v>
<v Speaker 3>reformers to actually even have the </v>

771
00:38:22.411 --> 00:38:23.244
<v Speaker 3>discussion to begin with because they </v>
<v Speaker 3>don't think there is any discussion to </v>

772
00:38:25.991 --> 00:38:30.330
<v Speaker 3>be had and it's all about us foreign </v>
<v Speaker 3>policy and they always try to divert.</v>

773
00:38:30.331 --> 00:38:33.370
<v Speaker 3>The discussion is all about America.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's all about America.</v>

774
00:38:33.390 --> 00:38:36.190
<v Speaker 3>And notice now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>now that I've more of these people</v>

775
00:38:36.190 --> 00:38:37.023
<v Speaker 1>on twitter and there's probably a good,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe 40 people like yourself that are </v>

776
00:38:40.661 --> 00:38:41.494
<v Speaker 1>trying to reform and coming from these </v>
<v Speaker 1>countries and trying to make things </v>

777
00:38:43.661 --> 00:38:44.494
<v Speaker 1>better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I see people like you tweeting about </v>

778
00:38:46.811 --> 00:38:47.644
<v Speaker 1>coexistence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>tweeting about how do we make things </v>

779
00:38:48.971 --> 00:38:49.690
<v Speaker 1>better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All that.</v>

780
00:38:49.690 --> 00:38:52.130
<v Speaker 1>And I never see it from the regressives </v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

781
00:38:52.180 --> 00:38:53.013
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They always are screaming about foreign </v>

782
00:38:55.061 --> 00:38:57.550
<v Speaker 1>policy or whatever it is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>defending our foreign policy.</v>

783
00:38:57.551 --> 00:39:00.160
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's not a binary system.</v>

784
00:39:00.190 --> 00:39:04.390
<v Speaker 1>It's not a binary and yet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what is the angle?</v>

785
00:39:04.391 --> 00:39:05.224
<v Speaker 1>What is it that they're throwing back at</v>
<v Speaker 1>you that they can't get behind what </v>

786
00:39:07.481 --> 00:39:09.100
<v Speaker 1>you're doing?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

787
00:39:09.101 --> 00:39:11.300
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean they think that</v>

788
00:39:11.400 --> 00:39:12.233
<v Speaker 3>the biggest problem.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So they see the world's consumption of </v>

789
00:39:15.420 --> 00:39:16.253
<v Speaker 3>like a pyramid.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the biggest problem in this world is </v>

790
00:39:19.470 --> 00:39:22.290
<v Speaker 3>cisgender white,</v>
<v Speaker 3>male capitalist,</v>

791
00:39:22.470 --> 00:39:24.810
<v Speaker 3>rich.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then we actually defined cisgender.</v>

792
00:39:24.811 --> 00:39:26.530
<v Speaker 3>I didn't know what it was until about a </v>
<v Speaker 3>month ago.</v>

793
00:39:26.550 --> 00:39:27.383
<v Speaker 3>I made two.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I got to because I got to talk to </v>

794
00:39:29.391 --> 00:39:32.430
<v Speaker 3>because of it is as a cisgender because </v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm cisgender.</v>

795
00:39:32.510 --> 00:39:32.940
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

796
00:39:32.940 --> 00:39:36.150
<v Speaker 1>It means that you were born at the </v>
<v Speaker 1>gender that you're central.</v>

797
00:39:36.430 --> 00:39:37.720
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's now a privilege.</v>

798
00:39:38.120 --> 00:39:38.953
<v Speaker 3>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I come from Iraq and my brother was </v>

799
00:39:40.931 --> 00:39:42.440
<v Speaker 3>killed and I told him that I'm </v>
<v Speaker 3>privileged,</v>

800
00:39:42.880 --> 00:39:43.810
<v Speaker 3>but anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so they,</v>

801
00:39:43.811 --> 00:39:46.900
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they have this pyramid in which there is</v>

802
00:39:47.080 --> 00:39:51.160
<v Speaker 3>a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they see the world based upon like race,</v>

803
00:39:51.161 --> 00:39:52.360
<v Speaker 3>gender,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

804
00:39:52.390 --> 00:39:53.223
<v Speaker 3>and financial privilege.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And they think that the biggest problem </v>

805
00:39:56.231 --> 00:40:00.190
<v Speaker 3>in this planet is western capitalism.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>

806
00:40:00.670 --> 00:40:04.360
<v Speaker 3>they link everything unleash,</v>
<v Speaker 3>walled into.</v>

807
00:40:04.361 --> 00:40:05.194
<v Speaker 3>It's a very American centric point of </v>
<v Speaker 3>view is that they link everything </v>

808
00:40:07.800 --> 00:40:10.390
<v Speaker 3>problem in this world as a problem of </v>
<v Speaker 3>so.</v>

809
00:40:10.510 --> 00:40:11.740
<v Speaker 3>So if,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if a,</v>

810
00:40:11.850 --> 00:40:12.683
<v Speaker 3>if a brown person and from Pakistan </v>
<v Speaker 3>wants to blow himself up to say to </v>

811
00:40:17.081 --> 00:40:17.914
<v Speaker 3>defend Jerusalem coat and a quote,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they will say that this is as a result </v>

812
00:40:21.790 --> 00:40:22.623
<v Speaker 3>of imperialism happening by the military</v>
<v Speaker 3>industrial complex connected to western </v>

813
00:40:27.281 --> 00:40:28.114
<v Speaker 3>capitalism.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So they always lump everything to that </v>

814
00:40:31.750 --> 00:40:33.850
<v Speaker 3>and everything is an expression of </v>
<v Speaker 3>grievances.</v>

815
00:40:33.850 --> 00:40:35.470
<v Speaker 3>So like you say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>somebody is like,</v>

816
00:40:35.620 --> 00:40:37.320
<v Speaker 3>I hate Jews.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And they say like,</v>

817
00:40:37.480 --> 00:40:39.910
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean he doesn't actually hate Jews,</v>

818
00:40:40.090 --> 00:40:44.980
<v Speaker 3>but that is his language to express his </v>
<v Speaker 3>first ration with American imperialism.</v>

819
00:40:45.230 --> 00:40:46.063
<v Speaker 3>So.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So they always link everything back to </v>

820
00:40:48.240 --> 00:40:49.880
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is there a,</v>

821
00:40:50.000 --> 00:40:50.833
<v Speaker 3>is there the point is like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then I can tell people like nom </v>

822
00:40:53.811 --> 00:40:56.560
<v Speaker 3>chomsky was like the head of the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of the movement.</v>

823
00:40:56.561 --> 00:40:57.394
<v Speaker 3>I would say I would have them on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I don't think he'd like to talk to </v>

824
00:41:00.011 --> 00:41:02.170
<v Speaker 3>someone smarter than him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

825
00:41:02.220 --> 00:41:04.070
<v Speaker 3>I mean the.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's,</v>

826
00:41:04.180 --> 00:41:05.013
<v Speaker 3>I don't think it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean Sam tried to engage with him and </v>

827
00:41:07.271 --> 00:41:09.700
<v Speaker 3>I don't think it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a,</v>

828
00:41:09.701 --> 00:41:13.240
<v Speaker 3>you can actually have a conversation is </v>
<v Speaker 3>that it's.</v>

829
00:41:13.300 --> 00:41:14.133
<v Speaker 3>I mean they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they seem to subscribe to a specific </v>

830
00:41:17.051 --> 00:41:17.884
<v Speaker 3>dog.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I always tried to like make the </v>

831
00:41:20.620 --> 00:41:21.453
<v Speaker 3>best of my friends that I can like </v>
<v Speaker 3>predict what Chomsky is going to write </v>

832
00:41:24.340 --> 00:41:26.740
<v Speaker 3>just by seeing the title of the article.</v>

833
00:41:26.740 --> 00:41:29.980
<v Speaker 3>So I like I make five points.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I say this is what Tom says going to say</v>

834
00:41:29.981 --> 00:41:32.020
<v Speaker 3>in the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in this paragraph and this paragraph.</v>

835
00:41:32.080 --> 00:41:34.880
<v Speaker 3>And I always like get my $50 because I </v>
<v Speaker 3>with them,</v>

836
00:41:35.210 --> 00:41:36.043
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what exactly Chomsky is going to say </v>

837
00:41:38.151 --> 00:41:40.760
<v Speaker 3>that is about American imperialism is </v>
<v Speaker 3>going to say it's about the grievance.</v>

838
00:41:40.761 --> 00:41:41.594
<v Speaker 3>This is going to say about capitalism </v>
<v Speaker 3>and all his like you don't need to read </v>

839
00:41:44.301 --> 00:41:47.150
<v Speaker 3>all his books even though I've read </v>
<v Speaker 3>quite a lot,</v>

840
00:41:47.180 --> 00:41:50.860
<v Speaker 3>but it seems like I've read two books </v>
<v Speaker 3>and all the rest were like,</v>

841
00:41:50.890 --> 00:41:51.723
<v Speaker 3>just subscribe to the same.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So is that the danger of these guys </v>

842
00:41:55.101 --> 00:41:55.934
<v Speaker 3>because what they're doing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>even if a certain percentage of what </v>

843
00:41:58.791 --> 00:42:00.650
<v Speaker 3>they're saying is right about American </v>
<v Speaker 3>foreign policy.</v>

844
00:42:00.651 --> 00:42:02.580
<v Speaker 3>I had Douglas Murray on last week.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

845
00:42:02.630 --> 00:42:05.720
<v Speaker 3>Who I thought really said something that</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'd never thought of before,</v>

846
00:42:05.870 --> 00:42:07.160
<v Speaker 3>which was that he said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

847
00:42:07.161 --> 00:42:09.470
<v Speaker 3>you Americans always think everything's </v>
<v Speaker 3>about you.</v>

848
00:42:10.000 --> 00:42:11.840
<v Speaker 3>So what you're saying that's what these </v>
<v Speaker 3>guys are doing,</v>

849
00:42:12.110 --> 00:42:15.460
<v Speaker 3>but let's just say a certain percentage.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's half truths.</v>

850
00:42:15.470 --> 00:42:16.880
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean many of them.</v>

851
00:42:16.881 --> 00:42:18.230
<v Speaker 3>I mean look at,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for example,</v>

852
00:42:18.590 --> 00:42:22.040
<v Speaker 3>what some apologists say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is that what they say?</v>

853
00:42:22.041 --> 00:42:24.380
<v Speaker 3>Like the majority of Muslims don't </v>
<v Speaker 3>support Isis.</v>

854
00:42:24.440 --> 00:42:28.730
<v Speaker 3>This is true,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it also doesn't support Isis.</v>

855
00:42:28.731 --> 00:42:31.520
<v Speaker 3>So the question is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>do you support Isis?</v>

856
00:42:31.820 --> 00:42:33.770
<v Speaker 3>Are Not saying not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>doesn't meet,</v>

857
00:42:33.860 --> 00:42:35.450
<v Speaker 3>move you to the moderate.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

858
00:42:35.510 --> 00:42:40.510
<v Speaker 3>You can subscribe to a lot of beliefs </v>
<v Speaker 3>that I said you agree with Isis with and</v>

859
00:42:40.851 --> 00:42:41.950
<v Speaker 3>you don't need the support.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I says,</v>

860
00:42:41.990 --> 00:42:43.130
<v Speaker 3>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Ayatollah Khomeini,</v>

861
00:42:43.310 --> 00:42:45.380
<v Speaker 3>harmony and all of the ayatollahs in </v>
<v Speaker 3>Iran,</v>

862
00:42:45.540 --> 00:42:46.373
<v Speaker 3>they disagree with Isis,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but if you look at how they treat gays </v>

863
00:42:49.041 --> 00:42:51.830
<v Speaker 3>in Iran is not that much different than </v>
<v Speaker 3>Isis,</v>

864
00:42:51.950 --> 00:42:54.830
<v Speaker 3>so like the disagreement,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they tell you a truth,</v>

865
00:42:54.831 --> 00:42:56.930
<v Speaker 3>which is the majority of Muslims don't </v>
<v Speaker 3>agree with Isis,</v>

866
00:42:57.080 --> 00:42:57.913
<v Speaker 3>which is true,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that's true if they don't tell you </v>

867
00:43:00.170 --> 00:43:01.003
<v Speaker 3>that there's a significant amount of </v>
<v Speaker 3>Egyptians and Pakistanis and and and so </v>

868
00:43:05.241 --> 00:43:07.340
<v Speaker 3>many countries around the Muslim world,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that thing,</v>

869
00:43:07.341 --> 00:43:12.341
<v Speaker 3>that penalty apostasy should be death,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is so I think like the purest that</v>

870
00:43:13.070 --> 00:43:17.360
<v Speaker 3>has been done on like shutting on what </v>
<v Speaker 3>Muslims believe and I asked everybody to</v>

871
00:43:17.361 --> 00:43:17.540
<v Speaker 3>read.</v>

872
00:43:17.540 --> 00:43:21.230
<v Speaker 3>It was very intelligent because it asks </v>
<v Speaker 3>specific questions.</v>

873
00:43:21.440 --> 00:43:23.170
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People ask people like,</v>

874
00:43:23.330 --> 00:43:24.800
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>do you support isis or not?</v>

875
00:43:24.801 --> 00:43:28.370
<v Speaker 3>So this nine slash 11 or not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But they ask him like no questions.</v>

876
00:43:28.371 --> 00:43:29.204
<v Speaker 3>Do you think that suicide bombing is a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is an appropriate way of dealing with </v>

877
00:43:33.141 --> 00:43:36.050
<v Speaker 3>grievances and they use a significant </v>
<v Speaker 3>amount of saying yes,</v>

878
00:43:36.470 --> 00:43:37.303
<v Speaker 3>and do you think it should be allowed of</v>
<v Speaker 3>killing these people who conspired with </v>

879
00:43:40.080 --> 00:43:40.913
<v Speaker 3>new Americans?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the Israelis will say yes and a </v>

880
00:43:44.200 --> 00:43:46.730
<v Speaker 3>significant bonds will say yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So show that.</v>

881
00:43:46.760 --> 00:43:49.160
<v Speaker 3>So when somebody says so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all of these things,</v>

882
00:43:49.190 --> 00:43:51.200
<v Speaker 3>even though some of the parts are true,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

883
00:43:51.220 --> 00:43:51.831
<v Speaker 3>as I said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>

884
00:43:51.831 --> 00:43:55.470
<v Speaker 3>I got us foreign policy in Iraq has not </v>
<v Speaker 3>been very great and uh,</v>

885
00:43:55.790 --> 00:43:56.623
<v Speaker 3>just say the least and there are so many</v>
<v Speaker 3>things that should have been done that </v>

886
00:43:59.301 --> 00:44:00.170
<v Speaker 3>have not been done.</v>

887
00:44:00.290 --> 00:44:02.330
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so yes,</v>

888
00:44:02.520 --> 00:44:05.360
<v Speaker 3>United States foreign policy have a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>played a role in,</v>

889
00:44:06.310 --> 00:44:07.143
<v Speaker 3>in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in rise of the extremist in the Middle </v>

890
00:44:08.360 --> 00:44:09.680
<v Speaker 3>East,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they're not the root of the problem.</v>

891
00:44:09.681 --> 00:44:13.950
<v Speaker 3>There is a huge difference between.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And there isn't like it was kind of very</v>

892
00:44:13.951 --> 00:44:16.910
<v Speaker 3>ironic.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like the moment they agree,</v>

893
00:44:17.190 --> 00:44:18.023
<v Speaker 3>like for example,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the abortion clinics that had happened </v>

894
00:44:20.781 --> 00:44:21.614
<v Speaker 3>in United States,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they agreed that this is a result of </v>

895
00:44:23.661 --> 00:44:24.990
<v Speaker 3>religious fundamentalism,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

896
00:44:25.160 --> 00:44:25.993
<v Speaker 3>Many of the Liberals agree that Mike </v>
<v Speaker 3>Huckabee and Ted Cruz and all of these </v>

897
00:44:30.171 --> 00:44:31.004
<v Speaker 3>folks are motivated,</v>
<v Speaker 3>are Christian fundamentalists and they </v>

898
00:44:33.571 --> 00:44:36.750
<v Speaker 3>are worried about them because they're a</v>
<v Speaker 3>Christian fundamentalist,</v>

899
00:44:37.050 --> 00:44:40.830
<v Speaker 3>but the moment that this discussion goes</v>
<v Speaker 3>into Islam,</v>

900
00:44:41.190 --> 00:44:42.023
<v Speaker 3>the moment that know the root of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>fundamentalist has nothing to do with </v>

901
00:44:44.791 --> 00:44:45.624
<v Speaker 3>the tags,</v>
<v Speaker 3>has nothing to do with interpretation </v>

902
00:44:46.770 --> 00:44:50.070
<v Speaker 3>and it's all about us.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's immediately goes back and it's very</v>

903
00:44:50.071 --> 00:44:50.904
<v Speaker 3>self center like egotistical point of </v>
<v Speaker 3>view is that everything is about the </v>

904
00:44:54.240 --> 00:44:54.300
<v Speaker 3>United States.</v>

905
00:44:54.300 --> 00:44:55.133
<v Speaker 3>It's not solving anything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean I think that's actually a very </v>

906
00:44:57.841 --> 00:44:58.674
<v Speaker 3>dangerous as you mentioned,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because they are giving a free pass to </v>

907
00:45:01.321 --> 00:45:04.950
<v Speaker 3>these people that me and others who are </v>
<v Speaker 3>fighting on a daily basis,</v>

908
00:45:04.951 --> 00:45:08.640
<v Speaker 3>they were fighting against the theocrats</v>
<v Speaker 3>in our countries and and,</v>

909
00:45:08.670 --> 00:45:09.503
<v Speaker 3>and the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the regressive light has given these </v>

910
00:45:12.360 --> 00:45:15.220
<v Speaker 3>people a free pass to telling them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

911
00:45:15.290 --> 00:45:17.160
<v Speaker 3>it's nothing to do with.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's all about us.</v>

912
00:45:17.180 --> 00:45:18.900
<v Speaker 3>Do you think they consciously aware of </v>
<v Speaker 3>it?</v>

913
00:45:18.901 --> 00:45:19.734
<v Speaker 3>Because I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've sort of struggled with this </v>

914
00:45:20.341 --> 00:45:21.930
<v Speaker 3>question a bit and when I've talked to </v>
<v Speaker 3>people,</v>

915
00:45:22.080 --> 00:45:22.913
<v Speaker 3>I think a lot of people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think Sam at this point thinks that </v>

916
00:45:24.841 --> 00:45:26.750
<v Speaker 3>they're fully malicious in what they're </v>
<v Speaker 3>doing.</v>

917
00:45:27.020 --> 00:45:27.853
<v Speaker 3>I pretty much think so too,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I want to give some of these guys a </v>

918
00:45:30.571 --> 00:45:33.360
<v Speaker 3>little of the benefit of the doubt that </v>
<v Speaker 3>they're not doing this maliciously.</v>

919
00:45:33.900 --> 00:45:35.910
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it depends on,</v>

920
00:45:35.950 --> 00:45:37.560
<v Speaker 3>on who are we talking about?</v>

921
00:45:37.680 --> 00:45:38.790
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

922
00:45:38.960 --> 00:45:42.090
<v Speaker 3>I mean I think we need to mention names </v>
<v Speaker 3>here because every.</v>

923
00:45:42.170 --> 00:45:44.580
<v Speaker 3>I did want to mention names,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the.</v>

924
00:45:44.581 --> 00:45:44.840
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

925
00:45:44.840 --> 00:45:45.673
<v Speaker 3>I think that people like Nam Chomsky and</v>
<v Speaker 3>Frankenstein and some folks now I'm a </v>

926
00:45:48.810 --> 00:45:49.643
<v Speaker 3>client I think are motivated by an </v>
<v Speaker 3>ideology that they actually cared about </v>

927
00:45:54.210 --> 00:45:55.043
<v Speaker 3>which is left libertarianism,</v>
<v Speaker 3>anarchism against United States </v>

928
00:45:59.520 --> 00:46:00.353
<v Speaker 3>capitalism and things of that sort.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There are people who are completely </v>

929
00:46:03.721 --> 00:46:07.110
<v Speaker 3>disingenuous and completely dishonest </v>
<v Speaker 3>and they would,</v>

930
00:46:07.980 --> 00:46:10.740
<v Speaker 3>Mr presents all of other people's views </v>
<v Speaker 3>like I was.</v>

931
00:46:11.010 --> 00:46:11.770
<v Speaker 3>I was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think.</v>

932
00:46:11.770 --> 00:46:14.930
<v Speaker 3>I think all my viewers probably know the</v>
<v Speaker 3>names that you're going.</v>

933
00:46:15.830 --> 00:46:18.660
<v Speaker 3>There are people who like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like for example,</v>

934
00:46:18.661 --> 00:46:19.494
<v Speaker 3>I had a debate on which was featured on </v>
<v Speaker 3>NPR Wy and see I bought Islamophobia in </v>

935
00:46:22.981 --> 00:46:26.880
<v Speaker 3>New York City and I said there are </v>
<v Speaker 3>progressive Muslims,</v>

936
00:46:27.420 --> 00:46:28.253
<v Speaker 3>moderate Muslims,</v>
<v Speaker 3>conservative Muslims and extremists and </v>

937
00:46:31.550 --> 00:46:35.130
<v Speaker 3>they our attacked as being generalizing </v>
<v Speaker 3>on Muslims and I said,</v>

938
00:46:35.490 --> 00:46:37.320
<v Speaker 3>that is exactly what I didn't do.</v>

939
00:46:37.500 --> 00:46:38.333
<v Speaker 3>Is that the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that the statistics and the research is </v>

940
00:46:40.891 --> 00:46:41.724
<v Speaker 3>being done.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's to avoid generalizations is when </v>

941
00:46:43.711 --> 00:46:47.430
<v Speaker 3>you say there's like 40 percent of </v>
<v Speaker 3>Americans believe in creationism.</v>

942
00:46:47.690 --> 00:46:49.890
<v Speaker 3>You are literally saying that 60 percent</v>
<v Speaker 3>of them don't.</v>

943
00:46:49.920 --> 00:46:51.810
<v Speaker 3>That is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're not generalizing on Americans,</v>

944
00:46:52.080 --> 00:46:52.913
<v Speaker 3>but I kept repeating the same statement </v>
<v Speaker 3>and they kept saying that you are </v>

945
00:46:55.831 --> 00:46:56.664
<v Speaker 3>generalizing all Muslims as extremists.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I kept repeating and they kept </v>

946
00:47:00.481 --> 00:47:04.690
<v Speaker 3>saying the same thing and then they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they go in and,</v>

947
00:47:04.691 --> 00:47:05.524
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and take something out of context and </v>

948
00:47:07.411 --> 00:47:10.380
<v Speaker 3>then they put that in a meme and shared </v>
<v Speaker 3>it on social media.</v>

949
00:47:10.650 --> 00:47:14.700
<v Speaker 3>And somehow I started getting attack as </v>
<v Speaker 3>we generalizing all Muslims,</v>

950
00:47:14.880 --> 00:47:17.550
<v Speaker 3>which is completely disingenuous.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I mean,</v>

951
00:47:18.690 --> 00:47:19.523
<v Speaker 3>what Sam has been dealing with is pretty</v>
<v Speaker 3>much what many of us who are actually </v>

952
00:47:23.791 --> 00:47:27.780
<v Speaker 3>talking about this subject that I was </v>
<v Speaker 3>dealing with is that they are,</v>

953
00:47:28.040 --> 00:47:28.873
<v Speaker 3>they're purely people are purely </v>
<v Speaker 3>disingenuous on the subject and the day </v>

954
00:47:34.020 --> 00:47:34.853
<v Speaker 3>and actually it's kind of interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that they want to create </v>

955
00:47:37.961 --> 00:47:38.794
<v Speaker 3>something,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what I was telling you about Bashar Al </v>

956
00:47:40.120 --> 00:47:40.953
<v Speaker 3>Assad,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is to destroy all the nuanced </v>

957
00:47:44.560 --> 00:47:45.393
<v Speaker 3>approach of the liberal critics of Islam</v>
<v Speaker 3>and try to create the battle between </v>

958
00:47:49.630 --> 00:47:50.463
<v Speaker 3>them and people like Pamela Geller and </v>
<v Speaker 3>Robert Spencer and all of the far right </v>

959
00:47:55.540 --> 00:47:56.750
<v Speaker 3>morons.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

960
00:47:56.860 --> 00:48:00.730
<v Speaker 3>And so that way they will give people a </v>
<v Speaker 3>binary system and which they tell.</v>

961
00:48:01.060 --> 00:48:04.390
<v Speaker 3>You know what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So there was a war between far right,</v>

962
00:48:04.391 --> 00:48:07.860
<v Speaker 3>fascist and Muslim medicine people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So which side you can achieve.</v>

963
00:48:07.990 --> 00:48:10.070
<v Speaker 1>I love that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love that framing because I,</v>

964
00:48:10.270 --> 00:48:11.103
<v Speaker 1>I mean I'm getting email literally from </v>
<v Speaker 1>all over the world every day at this </v>

965
00:48:14.441 --> 00:48:16.930
<v Speaker 1>point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People talking about this middle ground.</v>

966
00:48:17.140 --> 00:48:17.973
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why I wanted to connect with you </v>

967
00:48:18.851 --> 00:48:19.684
<v Speaker 1>and that's why I've been talking about </v>
<v Speaker 1>this stuff on the show because I don't </v>

968
00:48:21.221 --> 00:48:25.300
<v Speaker 1>think most people are one side or the </v>
<v Speaker 1>far left or the far right.</v>

969
00:48:25.480 --> 00:48:26.740
<v Speaker 1>Most people are right here.</v>

970
00:48:26.910 --> 00:48:28.030
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean for the.</v>

971
00:48:28.080 --> 00:48:31.380
<v Speaker 3>I mean sometimes I'm in on college </v>
<v Speaker 3>campuses.</v>

972
00:48:31.740 --> 00:48:36.240
<v Speaker 3>It seems to me that the debate is also </v>
<v Speaker 3>like it's very polarized.</v>

973
00:48:36.270 --> 00:48:39.360
<v Speaker 3>Like I and I was speaking at UC Berkeley</v>
<v Speaker 3>and Palo Alto and I,</v>

974
00:48:39.650 --> 00:48:40.483
<v Speaker 3>and I'm speaking in Cornell and I spoken</v>
<v Speaker 3>so many universities before that I can </v>

975
00:48:43.351 --> 00:48:44.184
<v Speaker 3>see that encompasses the debate seems to</v>
<v Speaker 3>be much more polarized and it's on the </v>

976
00:48:49.891 --> 00:48:51.490
<v Speaker 3>media and the</v>

977
00:48:52.060 --> 00:48:53.360
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I'm guessing it's a lot.</v>

978
00:48:53.400 --> 00:48:56.010
<v Speaker 1>It's a lot of white liberals on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>left.</v>

979
00:48:56.230 --> 00:48:57.610
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It is upset with you.</v>

980
00:48:57.670 --> 00:48:58.301
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It,</v>

981
00:48:58.301 --> 00:48:59.134
<v Speaker 3>which is which is extremely,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so they always want to turn it up by </v>

982
00:49:00.970 --> 00:49:01.900
<v Speaker 3>them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

983
00:49:01.950 --> 00:49:05.260
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I kept talking about like issues like to</v>

984
00:49:05.261 --> 00:49:07.660
<v Speaker 3>honor killing in Iraq and things of that</v>
<v Speaker 3>sort.</v>

985
00:49:08.050 --> 00:49:11.260
<v Speaker 3>And then a guy jumps up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There has to be like a white liberal.</v>

986
00:49:11.261 --> 00:49:12.094
<v Speaker 3>They are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so there has to be this guy that was </v>

987
00:49:12.941 --> 00:49:15.100
<v Speaker 3>gonna be.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This dude shows up at my venue,</v>

988
00:49:15.390 --> 00:49:17.230
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever I go around this state.</v>

989
00:49:17.231 --> 00:49:20.010
<v Speaker 3>So say no.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's nothing to do with the culture.</v>

990
00:49:20.011 --> 00:49:22.270
<v Speaker 3>It's nothing to do with the legendary.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's all about us.</v>

991
00:49:22.780 --> 00:49:23.613
<v Speaker 3>Don't you know about that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Have you have to give me like the </v>

992
00:49:24.881 --> 00:49:27.250
<v Speaker 3>lecture about the military industrial </v>
<v Speaker 3>complex.</v>

993
00:49:27.251 --> 00:49:29.290
<v Speaker 3>Don't you know about Wall Street?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Don't pay taxes.</v>

994
00:49:29.510 --> 00:49:31.570
<v Speaker 3>The so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so none of the stuff.</v>

995
00:49:31.750 --> 00:49:33.540
<v Speaker 3>You're not defending any of it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>

996
00:49:33.840 --> 00:49:34.780
<v Speaker 3>There is no correlation.</v>

997
00:49:34.780 --> 00:49:35.270
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

998
00:49:35.270 --> 00:49:36.103
<v Speaker 3>like I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I always mentioned this example is that </v>

999
00:49:37.360 --> 00:49:39.280
<v Speaker 3>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if somebody,</v>

1000
00:49:40.000 --> 00:49:41.890
<v Speaker 3>let's say a radical Muslim,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he walks in,</v>

1001
00:49:42.070 --> 00:49:46.900
<v Speaker 3>let's say a small town in Arkansas or </v>
<v Speaker 3>Mississippi and some redneck goes in and</v>

1002
00:49:46.901 --> 00:49:48.840
<v Speaker 3>calls them like a San Diego and like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

1003
00:49:48.860 --> 00:49:51.580
<v Speaker 3>he faced any racism there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then this person,</v>

1004
00:49:51.581 --> 00:49:55.570
<v Speaker 3>the same person goes back to his house </v>
<v Speaker 3>and kills his daughter because she added</v>

1005
00:49:55.571 --> 00:49:56.404
<v Speaker 3>the guy on facebook.</v>
<v Speaker 3>These two actions are not related to </v>

1006
00:49:58.230 --> 00:49:59.063
<v Speaker 3>with each other.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is that what some people think is that </v>

1007
00:50:01.660 --> 00:50:04.480
<v Speaker 3>this guy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because he's facing oppression or racism</v>

1008
00:50:04.481 --> 00:50:07.900
<v Speaker 3>and some sort does lead,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let him to kill his daughter,</v>

1009
00:50:07.901 --> 00:50:08.734
<v Speaker 3>which something that he believed in </v>
<v Speaker 3>probably before he came to the United </v>

1010
00:50:12.070 --> 00:50:13.990
<v Speaker 3>States.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so yeah,</v>

1011
00:50:13.991 --> 00:50:18.220
<v Speaker 3>and they think that everything is really</v>
<v Speaker 3>centered about oppression dynamics and,</v>

1012
00:50:18.350 --> 00:50:19.183
<v Speaker 3>and what's happening is that now you can</v>
<v Speaker 3>not even talk about the subject without </v>

1013
00:50:22.060 --> 00:50:24.900
<v Speaker 3>claiming to be a victim and it claiming </v>
<v Speaker 3>to be oppressed now.</v>

1014
00:50:24.910 --> 00:50:25.743
<v Speaker 3>Like the whole competition is that who's</v>
<v Speaker 3>the most victim and that's like I don't </v>

1015
00:50:29.241 --> 00:50:32.570
<v Speaker 3>really want to go to the identity </v>
<v Speaker 3>politics myself because it's like a very</v>

1016
00:50:32.780 --> 00:50:33.613
<v Speaker 3>crazy world is like all that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like now I look at websites like tumblr </v>

1017
00:50:36.771 --> 00:50:39.990
<v Speaker 3>or things like this and was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>somebody identification is like,</v>

1018
00:50:40.190 --> 00:50:42.820
<v Speaker 3>it's not like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh I'm from there and I studied there or</v>

1019
00:50:42.821 --> 00:50:44.030
<v Speaker 3>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like I,</v>

1020
00:50:44.040 --> 00:50:46.760
<v Speaker 3>I'm transgender,</v>
<v Speaker 3>gender fluid,</v>

1021
00:50:46.850 --> 00:50:49.190
<v Speaker 3>a asexual,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this,</v>

1022
00:50:49.191 --> 00:50:49.851
<v Speaker 3>this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this,</v>

1023
00:50:49.851 --> 00:50:50.684
<v Speaker 3>this is all about like his oppression,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like how much is oppressed and that is </v>

1024
00:50:54.890 --> 00:50:58.280
<v Speaker 3>what is now concerned the biography like</v>
<v Speaker 3>in some places.</v>

1025
00:50:58.330 --> 00:50:59.030
<v Speaker 3>So</v>

1026
00:50:59.030 --> 00:50:59.863
<v Speaker 1>at some level,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you could lighten your skin and to </v>

1027
00:51:01.770 --> 00:51:02.603
<v Speaker 1>change your biography away from Iraq,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they'd like you a little bit more in a </v>

1028
00:51:05.121 --> 00:51:08.690
<v Speaker 1>weird way because they would think that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're helping the oppressed.</v>

1029
00:51:09.180 --> 00:51:10.013
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of somehow being from the place that </v>

1030
00:51:11.901 --> 00:51:14.180
<v Speaker 1>you're now betraying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like it's so warped.</v>

1031
00:51:14.210 --> 00:51:14.790
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1032
00:51:14.790 --> 00:51:15.770
<v Speaker 3>it's very.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1033
00:51:16.220 --> 00:51:18.380
<v Speaker 3>it's very.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean that as I said,</v>

1034
00:51:18.381 --> 00:51:19.910
<v Speaker 3>like they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they look at the wall,</v>

1035
00:51:19.940 --> 00:51:20.773
<v Speaker 3>the wall is pretty much like as a </v>
<v Speaker 3>pyramid and that's what like if you a </v>

1036
00:51:24.410 --> 00:51:25.243
<v Speaker 3>view blood like the critical race theory</v>
<v Speaker 3>and gender theory and it's pretty much </v>

1037
00:51:29.151 --> 00:51:29.984
<v Speaker 3>all about class,</v>
<v Speaker 3>gender and race and there's hardly any </v>

1038
00:51:32.481 --> 00:51:36.440
<v Speaker 3>mention of ideology and they.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that's the way they see the world.</v>

1039
00:51:36.441 --> 00:51:37.274
<v Speaker 3>So is there anything that a brown person</v>
<v Speaker 3>is doing even though that his culture </v>

1040
00:51:43.161 --> 00:51:45.950
<v Speaker 3>that existed before the United States or</v>
<v Speaker 3>even Israel,</v>

1041
00:51:47.500 --> 00:51:48.333
<v Speaker 3>they say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well this is as it as well of he's an </v>

1042
00:51:50.271 --> 00:51:52.970
<v Speaker 3>oppressed by the somebody else on the </v>
<v Speaker 3>upper class.</v>

1043
00:51:53.120 --> 00:51:54.770
<v Speaker 3>But there is a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there are signs of hope.</v>

1044
00:51:54.771 --> 00:51:55.604
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for example,</v>

1045
00:51:55.780 --> 00:51:57.860
<v Speaker 3>give me some hope.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We've got about eight minutes left.</v>

1046
00:51:57.861 --> 00:52:00.530
<v Speaker 3>Let's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There are signs of hope strongly is that</v>

1047
00:52:01.230 --> 00:52:04.910
<v Speaker 3>people go to movements at Oregon,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they see like the continuous help,</v>

1048
00:52:04.911 --> 00:52:05.744
<v Speaker 3>like many of these activists are doing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're trying to achieve things in </v>

1049
00:52:07.761 --> 00:52:08.594
<v Speaker 3>their own countries because like when I </v>
<v Speaker 3>started becoming an and when I started </v>

1050
00:52:10.701 --> 00:52:11.534
<v Speaker 3>like being active as myself and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and there were only very few people I </v>

1051
00:52:14.151 --> 00:52:16.010
<v Speaker 3>see on the Internet who are sacred are </v>
<v Speaker 3>free thinkers.</v>

1052
00:52:16.070 --> 00:52:20.660
<v Speaker 3>Now I look at facebook and social media </v>
<v Speaker 3>and I see tons of thousands from Iraq,</v>

1053
00:52:20.661 --> 00:52:22.910
<v Speaker 3>from Syria,</v>
<v Speaker 3>from Lebanon,</v>

1054
00:52:22.940 --> 00:52:23.773
<v Speaker 3>from all over the Arab world.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Countries like Malaysia has voted for a </v>

1055
00:52:26.691 --> 00:52:31.250
<v Speaker 3>secular country despite of all the </v>
<v Speaker 3>status quo of the region.</v>

1056
00:52:31.251 --> 00:52:32.084
<v Speaker 3>Is that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is that many people think that the </v>

1057
00:52:34.370 --> 00:52:35.203
<v Speaker 3>Middle East is like one country.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If it's like things out of bad </v>

1058
00:52:36.681 --> 00:52:38.090
<v Speaker 3>somewhere,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's bad everywhere else.</v>

1059
00:52:38.860 --> 00:52:41.660
<v Speaker 3>I mean places like northern Iraq,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is a Kurdish region,</v>

1060
00:52:41.960 --> 00:52:45.170
<v Speaker 3>they seem to be much more developed in </v>
<v Speaker 3>terms of human rights,</v>

1061
00:52:45.450 --> 00:52:46.283
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>than they have women on the ground </v>

1062
00:52:47.691 --> 00:52:48.970
<v Speaker 3>fighting Isis.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1063
00:52:49.080 --> 00:52:50.610
<v Speaker 3>Then Turkeys bombing them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a whole lot.</v>

1064
00:52:50.880 --> 00:52:53.080
<v Speaker 3>That's the.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean I've,</v>

1065
00:52:53.600 --> 00:52:54.433
<v Speaker 3>as I said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there are signs of pessimism because </v>

1066
00:52:56.001 --> 00:52:56.834
<v Speaker 3>Turkey has a long secular history and it</v>
<v Speaker 3>is going backward with the but at the </v>

1067
00:53:01.911 --> 00:53:02.744
<v Speaker 3>same time there is a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean I would say a very strong </v>

1068
00:53:04.640 --> 00:53:08.780
<v Speaker 3>position for the Argon in Turkey that </v>
<v Speaker 3>needs to be supported and that's,</v>

1069
00:53:09.180 --> 00:53:10.013
<v Speaker 3>and that's I think like if there's any </v>
<v Speaker 3>message I would give to the liberals is </v>

1070
00:53:12.300 --> 00:53:13.700
<v Speaker 3>like just don't betray us here.</v>

1071
00:53:13.940 --> 00:53:14.773
<v Speaker 3>Like the liberals in the way should </v>
<v Speaker 3>stand with their fellow liberals on the </v>

1072
00:53:17.571 --> 00:53:18.404
<v Speaker 3>east and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and just start to apply standards and </v>

1073
00:53:21.230 --> 00:53:23.240
<v Speaker 3>should not stand with our enemies.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's,</v>

1074
00:53:23.360 --> 00:53:25.620
<v Speaker 3>that's if there's a message I can say </v>
<v Speaker 3>just stand.</v>

1075
00:53:25.830 --> 00:53:27.070
<v Speaker 3>If you don't want to help,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just done,</v>

1076
00:53:27.110 --> 00:53:30.180
<v Speaker 3>don't stand with our lab.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just make it easier.</v>

1077
00:53:30.630 --> 00:53:31.463
<v Speaker 3>Well I love that message and I love the </v>
<v Speaker 3>fact that you brought it also back to </v>

1078
00:53:33.871 --> 00:53:34.704
<v Speaker 3>colleges because that's where I started </v>
<v Speaker 3>the show today because we know we have </v>

1079
00:53:37.051 --> 00:53:37.884
<v Speaker 3>all this stuff with what's going on on </v>
<v Speaker 3>our yard to Missouri and yelled the </v>

1080
00:53:40.920 --> 00:53:42.150
<v Speaker 3>recent cases.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>

1081
00:53:42.151 --> 00:53:45.400
<v Speaker 3>So that's what we were talking about </v>
<v Speaker 3>earlier and to me it's,</v>

1082
00:53:45.430 --> 00:53:49.170
<v Speaker 3>it's a direct extension of what these </v>
<v Speaker 3>guys on the left have done.</v>

1083
00:53:49.500 --> 00:53:52.030
<v Speaker 3>They've made everyone so intolerant.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

1084
00:53:52.050 --> 00:53:52.883
<v Speaker 3>As you're saying that now it's sort of </v>
<v Speaker 3>like they are now reaping what they </v>

1085
00:53:55.920 --> 00:53:57.070
<v Speaker 3>sowed,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yada.</v>

1086
00:53:57.070 --> 00:54:00.800
<v Speaker 3>It's kind of very interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like it's a slippery slope.</v>

1087
00:54:00.801 --> 00:54:01.634
<v Speaker 3>They're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're going to see over the moment of </v>

1088
00:54:02.871 --> 00:54:04.440
<v Speaker 3>time they're going to start at talking </v>
<v Speaker 3>to each other.</v>

1089
00:54:04.441 --> 00:54:06.690
<v Speaker 3>So it was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was a female,</v>

1090
00:54:06.691 --> 00:54:07.524
<v Speaker 3>the female white feminist or criticizing</v>
<v Speaker 3>male white feminists as being male </v>

1091
00:54:10.771 --> 00:54:11.604
<v Speaker 3>privilege.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now the female is going to get attacked </v>

1092
00:54:14.011 --> 00:54:16.440
<v Speaker 3>by a transgender disabled person of </v>
<v Speaker 3>color.</v>

1093
00:54:16.600 --> 00:54:19.260
<v Speaker 3>You're the white tiles,</v>
<v Speaker 3>tiles,</v>

1094
00:54:19.350 --> 00:54:21.270
<v Speaker 3>gender nondisabled.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

1095
00:54:21.590 --> 00:54:25.740
<v Speaker 3>so they're going to start talking to </v>
<v Speaker 3>each other and eventually nobody's going</v>

1096
00:54:25.741 --> 00:54:28.860
<v Speaker 3>to be allowed to speak because anybody's</v>
<v Speaker 3>going to claim our fence.</v>

1097
00:54:29.220 --> 00:54:30.053
<v Speaker 3>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that all the trivializing their </v>

1098
00:54:32.191 --> 00:54:35.490
<v Speaker 3>experience of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of just ended with a funny story.</v>

1099
00:54:35.500 --> 00:54:36.333
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>with people like this is somebody </v>

1100
00:54:38.370 --> 00:54:40.320
<v Speaker 3>messaged me and he said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she said,</v>

1101
00:54:41.100 --> 00:54:43.830
<v Speaker 3>you should stopped posting pictures of </v>
<v Speaker 3>you smiling on facebook.</v>

1102
00:54:43.980 --> 00:54:44.970
<v Speaker 3>And I said like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

1103
00:54:44.971 --> 00:54:45.840
<v Speaker 3>what's going on over here?</v>

1104
00:54:46.200 --> 00:54:47.860
<v Speaker 3>And then she said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1105
00:54:47.940 --> 00:54:48.773
<v Speaker 3>when you post pictures of you smiling,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you are intentionally trying to </v>

1106
00:54:52.171 --> 00:54:54.630
<v Speaker 3>trivialize the experience of depressed </v>
<v Speaker 3>people.</v>

1107
00:54:55.500 --> 00:54:56.730
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>lol,</v>

1108
00:54:56.820 --> 00:54:57.653
<v Speaker 3>are you kidding me?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then she like blocked me </v>

1109
00:54:58.891 --> 00:55:01.920
<v Speaker 3>immediately.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

1110
00:55:01.950 --> 00:55:02.783
<v Speaker 3>so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and eventually the 44 does this person </v>

1111
00:55:04.291 --> 00:55:05.124
<v Speaker 3>get attacked.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But other people who may also consider </v>

1112
00:55:07.561 --> 00:55:08.394
<v Speaker 3>her trivializing their experience by </v>
<v Speaker 3>like eating food without hand because </v>

1113
00:55:12.301 --> 00:55:13.190
<v Speaker 3>they're disabled.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

1114
00:55:13.340 --> 00:55:15.240
<v Speaker 3>so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so it just never ends,</v>

1115
00:55:15.960 --> 00:55:16.980
<v Speaker 3>never ends.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I think,</v>

1116
00:55:17.160 --> 00:55:17.993
<v Speaker 3>but I'm very glad that there's now a </v>
<v Speaker 3>counter movement to who are the real </v>

1117
00:55:21.361 --> 00:55:24.990
<v Speaker 3>liberals standing against the </v>
<v Speaker 3>progressives.</v>

1118
00:55:25.050 --> 00:55:25.883
<v Speaker 3>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because the thing is I want everyone to </v>

1119
00:55:27.631 --> 00:55:28.464
<v Speaker 3>be treated equally equally as shitty.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't have to treat everyone as </v>

1120
00:55:31.081 --> 00:55:32.700
<v Speaker 3>equally great.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Treat everyone equally as shitty.</v>

1121
00:55:32.701 --> 00:55:33.534
<v Speaker 3>That would be fine with me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want women wherever they are to be </v>

1122
00:55:35.881 --> 00:55:36.714
<v Speaker 3>treated equal,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whether the United States or whether </v>

1123
00:55:38.461 --> 00:55:39.294
<v Speaker 3>they're in Saudi Arabia,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want gay people to be treated equally </v>

1124
00:55:40.711 --> 00:55:44.580
<v Speaker 3>where I want the white,</v>
<v Speaker 3>CIS male to be treated shitty.</v>

1125
00:55:44.580 --> 00:55:47.840
<v Speaker 3>That guy can be treated well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's hope not.</v>

1126
00:55:47.850 --> 00:55:49.110
<v Speaker 3>But uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

1127
00:55:49.111 --> 00:55:50.090
<v Speaker 3>I mean that is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that is,</v>

1128
00:55:50.340 --> 00:55:51.173
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's what really motivated me when I </v>

1129
00:55:52.411 --> 00:55:54.360
<v Speaker 3>started my activism is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is literally,</v>

1130
00:55:54.540 --> 00:55:55.373
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the movement that I started is called </v>

1131
00:55:56.461 --> 00:55:57.294
<v Speaker 3>the global secular humanist movement in </v>
<v Speaker 3>which after seeing so many conflicts </v>

1132
00:56:00.571 --> 00:56:03.390
<v Speaker 3>about sectarianism and religious </v>
<v Speaker 3>extremism rising up,</v>

1133
00:56:03.750 --> 00:56:07.320
<v Speaker 3>is that the best way is to create a </v>
<v Speaker 3>sector of society,</v>

1134
00:56:07.590 --> 00:56:09.720
<v Speaker 3>secular,</v>
<v Speaker 3>liberal society in which all people,</v>

1135
00:56:09.960 --> 00:56:10.793
<v Speaker 3>regardless of race or gender or sexual </v>
<v Speaker 3>orientation would live equally without </v>

1136
00:56:15.840 --> 00:56:17.040
<v Speaker 3>saying that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

1137
00:56:17.170 --> 00:56:19.890
<v Speaker 3>because it's their culture and things of</v>
<v Speaker 3>that sort.</v>

1138
00:56:19.891 --> 00:56:20.730
<v Speaker 3>Because,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1139
00:56:20.731 --> 00:56:21.420
<v Speaker 3>my,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my,</v>

1140
00:56:21.420 --> 00:56:23.860
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>motto as humans have rights,</v>

1141
00:56:24.090 --> 00:56:27.120
<v Speaker 3>cultures and beliefs,</v>
<v Speaker 3>don't todd rice and yeah,</v>

1142
00:56:27.420 --> 00:56:28.253
<v Speaker 3>ideas that should be up to criticism and</v>
<v Speaker 3>debates and human eyes have to be </v>

1143
00:56:31.241 --> 00:56:32.910
<v Speaker 3>sustained all across the board.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1144
