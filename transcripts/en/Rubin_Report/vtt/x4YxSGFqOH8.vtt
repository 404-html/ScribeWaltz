1
00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:09.530
<v Speaker 1>So Monday was my 41st birthday and this </v>
<v Speaker 1>helium inflated storm troopers showed up</v>

2
00:00:09.531 --> 00:00:10.364
<v Speaker 1>at my door and I couldn't possibly pass </v>
<v Speaker 1>up the opportunity to use him as both a </v>

3
00:00:13.521 --> 00:00:16.520
<v Speaker 1>prop and a metaphor for this week's </v>
<v Speaker 1>direct message.</v>

4
00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:17.653
<v Speaker 1>One of the ideas which keeps popping up </v>
<v Speaker 1>in the discussions we're having around </v>

5
00:00:19.851 --> 00:00:20.684
<v Speaker 1>here is that old political labels are </v>
<v Speaker 1>becoming more and more meaningless by </v>

6
00:00:23.901 --> 00:00:24.734
<v Speaker 1>the day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The terms progressive and liberal had </v>

7
00:00:27.021 --> 00:00:29.360
<v Speaker 1>virtually nothing to do with each other </v>
<v Speaker 1>anymore.</v>

8
00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:33.020
<v Speaker 1>And if you're a classical liberal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're certainly not a leftist.</v>

9
00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:36.950
<v Speaker 1>Conservative and Republican don't have </v>
<v Speaker 1>much to do with each other today.</v>

10
00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.933
<v Speaker 1>As trump,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a populist who doesn't focus on social </v>

11
00:00:40.521 --> 00:00:41.354
<v Speaker 1>issues like gay marriage and legalizing </v>
<v Speaker 1>marijuana is now the leader of the gop </v>

12
00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:50.510
<v Speaker 1>for these reasons as well as the real </v>
<v Speaker 1>time crumbling of our mainstream media.</v>

13
00:00:50.511 --> 00:00:55.340
<v Speaker 1>The battle for freedom now is between </v>
<v Speaker 1>the authoritarians and the Libertarians.</v>

14
00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:56.503
<v Speaker 1>That is the battle over the soul of </v>
<v Speaker 1>America and the West in general is now </v>

15
00:00:59.841 --> 00:01:00.674
<v Speaker 1>about people who want the government to </v>
<v Speaker 1>have more control over your life versus </v>

16
00:01:03.801 --> 00:01:06.890
<v Speaker 1>the people who want the government to </v>
<v Speaker 1>have less control over your life.</v>

17
00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.963
<v Speaker 1>I think that by now you probably know </v>
<v Speaker 1>that I fall solidly in the camp of the </v>

18
00:01:11.631 --> 00:01:15.530
<v Speaker 1>people who want the government to have </v>
<v Speaker 1>less control over how you live,</v>

19
00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:16.693
<v Speaker 1>and that brings me to my friendly and </v>
<v Speaker 1>trustee storm trooper beside me in the </v>

20
00:01:21.051 --> 00:01:21.884
<v Speaker 1>original 1977 star wars.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The storm troopers were the foot </v>

21
00:01:25.041 --> 00:01:25.874
<v Speaker 1>soldiers for the Galactic Republic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a massive evil military regime who </v>

22
00:01:30.081 --> 00:01:33.440
<v Speaker 1>wanted to control every star system in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the galaxy.</v>

23
00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:34.513
<v Speaker 1>This would qualify as authoritarian.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The empire and the storm troopers were </v>

24
00:01:38.271 --> 00:01:41.300
<v Speaker 1>not keepers of the piece as the emperor </v>
<v Speaker 1>had promised,</v>

25
00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:46.250
<v Speaker 1>but authoritarian rulers who wanted to </v>
<v Speaker 1>end this the expand their power,</v>

26
00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:47.263
<v Speaker 1>hence they're building of the death star</v>
<v Speaker 1>to blow up any planet which didn't fall </v>

27
00:01:50.001 --> 00:01:51.320
<v Speaker 1>in line with their desires.</v>

28
00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:54.650
<v Speaker 1>Blowing up a planet is a pretty good way</v>
<v Speaker 1>to get people to do what you want.</v>

29
00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:57.380
<v Speaker 1>A dare I talk about the prequels,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but trust me,</v>

30
00:01:57.381 --> 00:01:58.214
<v Speaker 1>it works with this metaphor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Two thousand to star wars episode to </v>

31
00:02:01.101 --> 00:02:01.934
<v Speaker 1>attack of the clones takes place about </v>
<v Speaker 1>20 years before the original star wars </v>

32
00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:09.590
<v Speaker 1>in this film,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the storm troopers at that time known as</v>

33
00:02:09.591 --> 00:02:12.020
<v Speaker 1>the clone troopers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>were the good guys.</v>

34
00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:16.250
<v Speaker 1>They allied with the Jetta in defense of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Democratic Republic.</v>

35
00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:17.413
<v Speaker 1>Eventually Chancellor Palpatine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who had consolidated power himself and </v>

36
00:02:20.421 --> 00:02:22.790
<v Speaker 1>secretly ordered the creation of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>clone army,</v>

37
00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:23.893
<v Speaker 1>took control of the storm troopers and </v>
<v Speaker 1>the Senate and use democracy against </v>

38
00:02:27.891 --> 00:02:32.891
<v Speaker 1>itself at the same time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>going from chancellor to emperor in 2015</v>

39
00:02:33.431 --> 00:02:34.264
<v Speaker 1>is the force awakens,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which takes place about 20 years after </v>

40
00:02:36.981 --> 00:02:37.814
<v Speaker 1>the original trilogy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The storm troopers are again the bad </v>

41
00:02:40.491 --> 00:02:41.324
<v Speaker 1>guys.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This time in the form of the soldiers </v>

42
00:02:42.591 --> 00:02:43.424
<v Speaker 1>for the authoritarian first order,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which has risen from the ashes of the </v>

43
00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:48.860
<v Speaker 1>Galactic Republic.</v>

44
00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:52.340
<v Speaker 1>One of the heroes of the story,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Finn is a storm trooper gone rogue,</v>

45
00:02:52.341 --> 00:02:55.940
<v Speaker 1>who suddenly realizes that he as an end </v>
<v Speaker 1>of individual,</v>

46
00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:58.460
<v Speaker 1>can chart his own destiny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He puts,</v>

47
00:02:58.461 --> 00:03:02.320
<v Speaker 1>his collective is passed as a storm </v>
<v Speaker 1>trooper behind him and he becomes one of</v>

48
00:03:02.321 --> 00:03:03.154
<v Speaker 1>the heroes of the story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The point of all of this is that it </v>

49
00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:06.663
<v Speaker 1>isn't this storm trooper,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you should fear it's the power which </v>

50
00:03:09.851 --> 00:03:10.684
<v Speaker 1>commands him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Any ideology can be used as a force for </v>

51
00:03:13.901 --> 00:03:14.734
<v Speaker 1>good or for evil,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's why we should be reigning in </v>

52
00:03:17.441 --> 00:03:18.274
<v Speaker 1>authoritarianism of any kind,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even when it's your sort of </v>

53
00:03:21.821 --> 00:03:22.654
<v Speaker 1>authoritarianism in charge.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This whole metaphor took place in a </v>

54
00:03:26.201 --> 00:03:27.730
<v Speaker 1>galaxy far,</v>
<v Speaker 1>far away,</v>

55
00:03:27.731 --> 00:03:31.690
<v Speaker 1>but the lessons that it presents are </v>
<v Speaker 1>ones we can use right here on earth.</v>

56
00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:36.790
<v Speaker 1>Joining me to discuss authoritarianism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>burst libertarianism is author,</v>

57
00:03:36.791 --> 00:03:39.550

<v Speaker 2>history of the United States.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That is Russell.</v>

64
00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:03.750
<v Speaker 2>Welcome to the Rubin report.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Thanks for having me.</v>

65
00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:06.510
<v Speaker 2>That he is Russell.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That is a name.</v>

66
00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:10.350
<v Speaker 2>Sure is of a man who I feel knows what </v>
<v Speaker 2>he's saying.</v>

67
00:04:10.351 --> 00:04:13.140
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like there's some Gravitas to your name.</v>

68
00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:15.210
<v Speaker 2>Do you feel that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>first of all,</v>

69
00:04:15.211 --> 00:04:16.480
<v Speaker 2>my mother gets all the credit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

70
00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:19.020
<v Speaker 2>people sort of a compliment me on my </v>
<v Speaker 2>name all the time and I say,</v>

71
00:04:19.050 --> 00:04:20.010
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had nothing to do with it.</v>

72
00:04:20.020 --> 00:04:20.853
<v Speaker 2>I wish I could take credit for it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but do you see that as the like just a </v>

73
00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:29.460
<v Speaker 2>hideous and it's unfortunate because </v>
<v Speaker 2>then I have to be good.</v>

74
00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:30.413
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have to sort of say things that make </v>

75
00:04:31.771 --> 00:04:33.450
<v Speaker 2>sense and it's a lot of pressure for me.</v>

76
00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:35.100
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you just put on me.</v>

77
00:04:35.101 --> 00:04:37.090
<v Speaker 2>Thanks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just put an extra dose.</v>

78
00:04:37.091 --> 00:04:37.924
<v Speaker 2>If right now for an hour you're going to</v>
<v Speaker 2>have to make perfect sense because you </v>

79
00:04:40.921 --> 00:04:42.960
<v Speaker 2>know about this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is the internet pipe.</v>

80
00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:45.030
<v Speaker 2>Perfect sense coming up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Video.</v>

81
00:04:45.031 --> 00:04:47.370
<v Speaker 2>People are going to judge every word </v>
<v Speaker 2>that comes out of your mouth.</v>

82
00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:48.360
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've noticed that,</v>

83
00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:51.330
<v Speaker 2>but I'm looking forward to this because </v>
<v Speaker 2>we're going to talk about postmodernism.</v>

84
00:04:51.331 --> 00:04:54.570
<v Speaker 2>I think you have a slightly different </v>
<v Speaker 2>take than some of my previous guests.</v>

85
00:04:54.571 --> 00:04:56.940
<v Speaker 2>You have an interesting history,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so let's just dive into it.</v>

86
00:04:57.300 --> 00:05:01.650
<v Speaker 2>You grew up in a Marxists household in </v>
<v Speaker 2>Berkeley,</v>

87
00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:04.800
<v Speaker 2>California.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've given a lot of good buzzwords right</v>

88
00:05:04.801 --> 00:05:05.940
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In that first sentence,</v>

89
00:05:05.941 --> 00:05:08.220
<v Speaker 2>what was that like?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You could also have said the sixties and</v>

90
00:05:08.221 --> 00:05:10.800
<v Speaker 2>seventies when I was growing up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

91
00:05:10.950 --> 00:05:12.480
<v Speaker 2>that's a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd be right there.</v>

92
00:05:12.481 --> 00:05:13.740
<v Speaker 2>That's a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Plus that name,</v>

93
00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:14.270
<v Speaker 2>that Israel.</v>

94
00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:16.800
<v Speaker 2>So we combine things here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm kind of done.</v>

95
00:05:16.801 --> 00:05:19.100
<v Speaker 2>I mean we can stop the interview now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

96
00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:19.943
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My parents were members of a small </v>

97
00:05:22.650 --> 00:05:23.483
<v Speaker 2>Trotskyist sect.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was called the international </v>

98
00:05:25.531 --> 00:05:30.360
<v Speaker 2>socialists and what they did was they </v>
<v Speaker 2>industrialized,</v>

99
00:05:30.361 --> 00:05:31.194
<v Speaker 2>which meant that they left their </v>
<v Speaker 2>middleclass lives and went into heavy </v>

100
00:05:34.441 --> 00:05:37.710
<v Speaker 2>industry and to organize the proletariat</v>
<v Speaker 2>for revolution.</v>

101
00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:38.573
<v Speaker 2>So my mother became a clerical worker to</v>
<v Speaker 2>organize the secretaries for revolution </v>

102
00:05:42.791 --> 00:05:43.624
<v Speaker 2>and my stepfather,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who had gone to Exeter Academy and the </v>

103
00:05:47.670 --> 00:05:48.503
<v Speaker 2>University of Chicago,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he left his world to become a </v>

104
00:05:49.981 --> 00:05:50.814
<v Speaker 2>steelworker and a truck driver.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And his mission was to convince the </v>

105
00:05:54.241 --> 00:05:57.180
<v Speaker 2>workers to rise up and bring about a </v>
<v Speaker 2>communist revolution.</v>

106
00:05:57.800 --> 00:06:02.120
<v Speaker 2>So that was unsuccessful and know what </v>
<v Speaker 2>caused them to do it.</v>

107
00:06:02.121 --> 00:06:02.954
<v Speaker 2>Was it just generally what was happening</v>
<v Speaker 2>around then with the ward and it's hard </v>

108
00:06:05.701 --> 00:06:06.534
<v Speaker 2>to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's hard to explain why people come to </v>

109
00:06:08.091 --> 00:06:12.320
<v Speaker 2>particular ideologies,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they chose Berkeley and the sixties,</v>

110
00:06:12.321 --> 00:06:16.910
<v Speaker 2>they moved there and fell in with this </v>
<v Speaker 2>hardcore group and that's,</v>

111
00:06:16.970 --> 00:06:17.780
<v Speaker 2>that was their lives.</v>

112
00:06:17.780 --> 00:06:18.613
<v Speaker 2>And so that was my life when I was </v>
<v Speaker 2>growing up and we had meetings in our </v>

113
00:06:22.131 --> 00:06:25.700
<v Speaker 2>house and the comrades were sitting down</v>
<v Speaker 2>downstairs and talking about stuff.</v>

114
00:06:25.701 --> 00:06:27.350
<v Speaker 2>I had no idea what they're talking </v>
<v Speaker 2>about.</v>

115
00:06:27.351 --> 00:06:29.360
<v Speaker 2>I learned later,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>

116
00:06:29.361 --> 00:06:30.194
<v Speaker 2>it was heavy Marxist theory and which,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which a union shop should we infiltrate </v>

117
00:06:35.091 --> 00:06:36.970
<v Speaker 2>and which factory should we organize.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

118
00:06:37.130 --> 00:06:39.020
<v Speaker 2>and then there were visitors to our </v>
<v Speaker 2>house,</v>

119
00:06:39.021 --> 00:06:40.280
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there were black panthers.</v>

120
00:06:40.281 --> 00:06:43.460
<v Speaker 2>We lived about three blocks from the </v>
<v Speaker 2>black panthers national headquarters,</v>

121
00:06:43.461 --> 00:06:45.260
<v Speaker 2>which was actually in Berkeley and not </v>
<v Speaker 2>in Oakland.</v>

122
00:06:45.810 --> 00:06:49.010
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they were around and sort of hippies</v>

123
00:06:49.011 --> 00:06:53.600
<v Speaker 2>were around and members of the IRA came </v>
<v Speaker 2>and gave speeches and stuff like that.</v>

124
00:06:53.601 --> 00:06:54.740
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and my mother,</v>

125
00:06:54.830 --> 00:06:58.320
<v Speaker 2>one of the interesting things is that my</v>
<v Speaker 2>mother was the dominant figure in my,</v>

126
00:06:58.340 --> 00:06:59.173
<v Speaker 2>in my family.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She was the heavy duty intellectual </v>

127
00:07:00.741 --> 00:07:01.574
<v Speaker 2>actually.</v>

128
00:07:01.820 --> 00:07:06.820
<v Speaker 2>And so the idea of women being weak or </v>
<v Speaker 2>victimized or unable to compete with men</v>

129
00:07:09.801 --> 00:07:11.470
<v Speaker 2>has always been just a weird thing for </v>
<v Speaker 2>me.</v>

130
00:07:11.510 --> 00:07:12.343
<v Speaker 2>Alien idea,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because she was always the dominant </v>

131
00:07:14.061 --> 00:07:17.360
<v Speaker 2>force and I always looked up to her and </v>
<v Speaker 2>try to model myself after her.</v>

132
00:07:17.930 --> 00:07:18.763
<v Speaker 2>So were you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Once you became of age and started </v>

133
00:07:20.960 --> 00:07:21.793
<v Speaker 2>thinking about these ideas,</v>
<v Speaker 2>did you immediately jive with these </v>

134
00:07:24.261 --> 00:07:26.800
<v Speaker 2>ideas?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Did you have pushback or.</v>

135
00:07:27.370 --> 00:07:29.090
<v Speaker 2>So I will say this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My parents,</v>

136
00:07:29.180 --> 00:07:32.330
<v Speaker 2>as I recall,</v>
<v Speaker 2>did not try to indoctrinate me directly,</v>

137
00:07:32.810 --> 00:07:34.010
<v Speaker 2>but you can't help it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

138
00:07:34.011 --> 00:07:34.521
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're.</v>

139
00:07:34.521 --> 00:07:38.450
<v Speaker 2>If you're raised in a church family,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're gonna think that that's the truth</v>

140
00:07:38.451 --> 00:07:40.790
<v Speaker 2>and correct and the way to be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's what I said.</v>

141
00:07:40.791 --> 00:07:42.740
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my mother said that inspect.</v>

142
00:07:42.741 --> 00:07:45.350
<v Speaker 2>You said this in one of her speeches </v>
<v Speaker 2>that when I was about 10 years old,</v>

143
00:07:45.351 --> 00:07:47.320
<v Speaker 2>she said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want to grow up to be in the IAS.</v>

144
00:07:47.360 --> 00:07:49.730
<v Speaker 2>That's what I want to be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to be a socialist model.</v>

145
00:07:49.731 --> 00:07:50.564
<v Speaker 2>How do I do that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that was kind of my mission and it </v>

146
00:07:52.401 --> 00:07:53.900
<v Speaker 2>really means that it's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When I went to college,</v>

147
00:07:53.901 --> 00:07:57.140
<v Speaker 2>I didn't know what socialism even was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so that was my.</v>

148
00:07:57.290 --> 00:07:59.300
<v Speaker 2>I said this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I said I'm going to learn what socialism</v>

149
00:07:59.301 --> 00:08:03.220
<v Speaker 2>is and then become a socialist and sort </v>
<v Speaker 2>of what I did for awhile.</v>

150
00:08:03.310 --> 00:08:04.150
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

151
00:08:04.280 --> 00:08:05.510
<v Speaker 2>but that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that were off.</v>

152
00:08:06.230 --> 00:08:07.063
<v Speaker 2>So you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you write a lot and you talk about the </v>

153
00:08:10.660 --> 00:08:12.450
<v Speaker 2>outsiders.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Really the rebels,</v>

154
00:08:12.980 --> 00:08:14.630
<v Speaker 2>the people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the drunks,</v>

155
00:08:14.631 --> 00:08:15.464
<v Speaker 2>the fringes of society,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the people that were probably add a lot </v>

156
00:08:17.811 --> 00:08:21.300
<v Speaker 2>of these meetings now you don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

157
00:08:21.310 --> 00:08:22.210
<v Speaker 2>not the people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

158
00:08:22.350 --> 00:08:22.791
<v Speaker 2>that's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

159
00:08:22.791 --> 00:08:24.110
<v Speaker 2>that's a misconception about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

160
00:08:24.140 --> 00:08:24.973
<v Speaker 2>my work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's okay.</v>

161
00:08:25.250 --> 00:08:26.083
<v Speaker 2>Please clean it up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

162
00:08:26.090 --> 00:08:26.391
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

163
00:08:26.391 --> 00:08:28.550
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so know the people well,</v>

164
00:08:28.551 --> 00:08:29.031
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let me,</v>

165
00:08:29.031 --> 00:08:30.610
<v Speaker 2>let me tell you how I got there for.</v>

166
00:08:30.620 --> 00:08:33.140
<v Speaker 2>So I ended up going to Antioch College </v>
<v Speaker 2>in Ohio,</v>

167
00:08:33.141 --> 00:08:38.090
<v Speaker 2>which is this ultra ultra left college </v>
<v Speaker 2>run by hippies and anarchist basically,</v>

168
00:08:38.260 --> 00:08:39.740
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and punk rockers.</v>

169
00:08:39.800 --> 00:08:42.020
<v Speaker 2>And in fact we use,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's evergreen state.</v>

170
00:08:42.140 --> 00:08:42.973
<v Speaker 2>I was just gonna say mean.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We used to compete with evergreen for </v>

171
00:08:46.491 --> 00:08:47.324
<v Speaker 2>being the most politically correct,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the most left wing college in the </v>

172
00:08:49.461 --> 00:08:50.480
<v Speaker 2>country.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And we always thought,</v>

173
00:08:50.481 --> 00:08:51.860
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they don't know what they're doing.</v>

174
00:08:51.861 --> 00:08:54.560
<v Speaker 2>We are the true radical college.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's hilarious.</v>

175
00:08:54.590 --> 00:08:55.860
<v Speaker 2>I think we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the champions,</v>

176
00:08:55.861 --> 00:08:57.600
<v Speaker 2>and there's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have a lot of stories I could tell you</v>

177
00:08:57.601 --> 00:08:58.434
<v Speaker 2>about the insanity at Antioch College,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is kind of one of the reasons I </v>

178
00:09:00.631 --> 00:09:04.530
<v Speaker 2>started to think twice about this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Politics and culture.</v>

179
00:09:04.531 --> 00:09:05.364
<v Speaker 2>And can you give me one example is just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's just dive into that one second </v>

180
00:09:08.040 --> 00:09:11.250
<v Speaker 2>because that's this interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let me give you two.</v>

181
00:09:12.840 --> 00:09:17.100
<v Speaker 2>One is just sort of tragic and </v>
<v Speaker 2>disgusting and the other more comical,</v>

182
00:09:17.700 --> 00:09:20.070
<v Speaker 2>the tragic and disgusting one was the.</v>

183
00:09:20.070 --> 00:09:23.010
<v Speaker 2>There were two kids at Antioch when I'm </v>
<v Speaker 2>in my third year who had,</v>

184
00:09:23.011 --> 00:09:25.740
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>an antichristian art exhibit.</v>

185
00:09:25.890 --> 00:09:26.723
<v Speaker 2>And so they had crosses on the wall and </v>
<v Speaker 2>they had a fire in a barrel in the </v>

186
00:09:30.390 --> 00:09:31.223
<v Speaker 2>middle of the room.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And at one point they took one of the </v>

187
00:09:32.431 --> 00:09:34.770
<v Speaker 2>crosses down and threw it in the barrel.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

188
00:09:35.160 --> 00:09:38.040
<v Speaker 2>Everyone there understood this was an </v>
<v Speaker 2>antichristian statement.</v>

189
00:09:38.310 --> 00:09:39.900
<v Speaker 2>Oh No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this was racism.</v>

190
00:09:39.930 --> 00:09:43.350
<v Speaker 2>This was the Ku Klux Klan.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Those kids got expelled.</v>

191
00:09:43.840 --> 00:09:46.200
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because it was widely perceived to be an</v>

192
00:09:46.201 --> 00:09:48.020
<v Speaker 2>act of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

193
00:09:48.420 --> 00:09:49.253
<v Speaker 2>racist violence,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they had to leave the college and I </v>

194
00:09:51.571 --> 00:09:53.610
<v Speaker 2>was the editor of the newspaper at the </v>
<v Speaker 2>time and I said,</v>

195
00:09:53.640 --> 00:09:56.010
<v Speaker 2>this is kind of my turning point for me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>

196
00:09:56.070 --> 00:09:57.810
<v Speaker 2>what are you talking about?</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is insane.</v>

197
00:09:57.811 --> 00:10:02.811
<v Speaker 2>It really had this witch hunt feel on </v>
<v Speaker 2>campus and it felt I felt guilty and bad</v>

198
00:10:03.720 --> 00:10:06.870
<v Speaker 2>for having to come to their defense </v>
<v Speaker 2>simply to explain.</v>

199
00:10:07.260 --> 00:10:10.310
<v Speaker 2>That had nothing to do with race at all </v>
<v Speaker 2>and then.</v>

200
00:10:10.470 --> 00:10:11.303
<v Speaker 2>And that there was that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was this hysteria that really </v>

201
00:10:13.741 --> 00:10:15.000
<v Speaker 2>takes no prisoners.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

202
00:10:15.001 --> 00:10:15.834
<v Speaker 2>you have to be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have to eliminate the evil once you </v>

203
00:10:17.251 --> 00:10:18.084
<v Speaker 2>identify it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why do you think that that ideology </v>

204
00:10:22.021 --> 00:10:22.854
<v Speaker 2>breeds that hysteria?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because we're seeing this literally </v>

205
00:10:24.631 --> 00:10:25.710
<v Speaker 2>right now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

206
00:10:25.711 --> 00:10:27.510
<v Speaker 2>There's something that goes on in </v>
<v Speaker 2>college campuses.</v>

207
00:10:27.540 --> 00:10:28.373
<v Speaker 2>Actually,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my mother said this to me when that </v>

208
00:10:30.001 --> 00:10:30.631
<v Speaker 2>happened.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She said,</v>

209
00:10:30.631 --> 00:10:31.290
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know what?</v>

210
00:10:31.290 --> 00:10:34.050
<v Speaker 2>They need the devil.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They need to have a devil.</v>

211
00:10:35.160 --> 00:10:35.993
<v Speaker 2>As soon as you step on campus,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you start reading about the history of </v>

212
00:10:37.501 --> 00:10:38.334
<v Speaker 2>oppression and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think a lot of that's correct in many </v>

213
00:10:40.171 --> 00:10:41.004
<v Speaker 2>ways.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

214
00:10:41.070 --> 00:10:44.310
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot of bad things that have </v>
<v Speaker 2>happened in this country and elsewhere.</v>

215
00:10:45.150 --> 00:10:47.790
<v Speaker 2>And then you look around and you're an </v>
<v Speaker 2>affluent,</v>

216
00:10:47.850 --> 00:10:49.770
<v Speaker 2>very privileged person in this world.</v>

217
00:10:49.770 --> 00:10:53.700
<v Speaker 2>You're in the top one percent or more,</v>
<v Speaker 2>every college student basically is that,</v>

218
00:10:53.701 --> 00:10:56.490
<v Speaker 2>especially at Antioch.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there is no devil,</v>

219
00:10:56.491 --> 00:10:58.230
<v Speaker 2>there is no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there is no bull connor,</v>

220
00:10:58.260 --> 00:10:59.093
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there,</v>

221
00:10:59.210 --> 00:11:01.080
<v Speaker 2>there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's no one like that around here.</v>

222
00:11:01.081 --> 00:11:01.914
<v Speaker 2>So you have to find one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so what we did was we kind of </v>

223
00:11:04.110 --> 00:11:04.943
<v Speaker 2>focused on that administrators,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the president and his evil </v>

224
00:11:08.221 --> 00:11:11.300
<v Speaker 2>administrators.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We just inherently have to be eve.</v>

225
00:11:11.320 --> 00:11:13.950
<v Speaker 2>We assumed they were evil and they were </v>
<v Speaker 2>out to get us.</v>

226
00:11:13.951 --> 00:11:16.350
<v Speaker 2>And so we had to get them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so one day,</v>

227
00:11:16.440 --> 00:11:17.273
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>two kids broken when night two kids </v>

228
00:11:18.721 --> 00:11:22.560
<v Speaker 2>broke into the president's office and </v>
<v Speaker 2>took a shit on his desk.</v>

229
00:11:23.670 --> 00:11:25.410
<v Speaker 2>And that was our,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that was our statement.</v>

230
00:11:26.010 --> 00:11:27.840
<v Speaker 2>That was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that was telling him who is,</v>

231
00:11:27.841 --> 00:11:30.060
<v Speaker 2>who works at many levels and what was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what,</v>

232
00:11:32.320 --> 00:11:33.001
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

233
00:11:33.001 --> 00:11:33.834
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean those are just two of the most </v>

234
00:11:34.531 --> 00:11:35.410
<v Speaker 2>comical,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

235
00:11:35.500 --> 00:11:36.333
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>are worst things that happened at </v>

236
00:11:37.231 --> 00:11:38.064
<v Speaker 2>Antioch in that way.</v>

237
00:11:38.400 --> 00:11:40.410
<v Speaker 2>It was also very liberating place.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

238
00:11:40.411 --> 00:11:43.140
<v Speaker 2>there was a lot of the hippies were good</v>
<v Speaker 2>in some ways.</v>

239
00:11:43.141 --> 00:11:43.974
<v Speaker 2>I mean there was a lot of nudity and </v>
<v Speaker 2>smoking pot and lots of sexual freedom </v>

240
00:11:47.101 --> 00:11:50.520
<v Speaker 2>which has gone now and college campuses </v>
<v Speaker 2>and I love that stuff,</v>

241
00:11:50.850 --> 00:11:51.683
<v Speaker 2>but I hated this puritanical wing </v>
<v Speaker 2>culture and that's when I started to </v>

242
00:11:55.271 --> 00:11:58.000
<v Speaker 2>move against it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then I went to Columbia for graduate</v>

243
00:11:58.001 --> 00:12:03.001
<v Speaker 2>school and everybody there is a Marxist </v>
<v Speaker 2>or a socialist or maybe a new deal,</v>

244
00:12:03.461 --> 00:12:05.140
<v Speaker 2>liberal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but everybody's on the left.</v>

245
00:12:05.200 --> 00:12:06.033
<v Speaker 2>Everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And this was upper west side of </v>

246
00:12:06.671 --> 00:12:07.580
<v Speaker 2>Manhattan as you know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

247
00:12:08.670 --> 00:12:09.503
<v Speaker 2>and I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I needed to be a socialist and so I </v>

248
00:12:11.441 --> 00:12:12.274
<v Speaker 2>started to study as hard as I could to </v>
<v Speaker 2>be a socialist and be a socialist </v>

249
00:12:14.411 --> 00:12:16.690
<v Speaker 2>historian,</v>
<v Speaker 2>be I became a Labor historian,</v>

250
00:12:16.691 --> 00:12:19.750
<v Speaker 2>which is what you're supposed to do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I started noticing that all of these</v>

251
00:12:19.751 --> 00:12:22.630
<v Speaker 2>people didn't care what clothes they </v>
<v Speaker 2>wore.</v>

252
00:12:22.630 --> 00:12:24.370
<v Speaker 2>They had no idea what movies were </v>
<v Speaker 2>applying.</v>

253
00:12:24.371 --> 00:12:25.204
<v Speaker 2>They never watched television.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They were completely oblivious to the </v>

254
00:12:27.461 --> 00:12:29.380
<v Speaker 2>lives of real people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And in particular,</v>

255
00:12:29.381 --> 00:12:30.214
<v Speaker 2>we actually,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd say they were actually hostile to </v>

256
00:12:31.601 --> 00:12:35.530
<v Speaker 2>the ways in which ordinary Americans </v>
<v Speaker 2>chose to spend their leisure time.</v>

257
00:12:35.680 --> 00:12:37.870
<v Speaker 2>So popular culture was something that </v>
<v Speaker 2>was bad.</v>

258
00:12:38.890 --> 00:12:40.600
<v Speaker 2>It was a false consciousness,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in fact,</v>

259
00:12:40.601 --> 00:12:41.434
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is a,</v>

260
00:12:41.590 --> 00:12:43.150
<v Speaker 2>this is an idea from the Frankfurt </v>
<v Speaker 2>school,</v>

261
00:12:43.151 --> 00:12:44.470
<v Speaker 2>from Adorno.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He said this,</v>

262
00:12:44.710 --> 00:12:45.543
<v Speaker 2>he said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>popular culture is simply the way the </v>

263
00:12:47.831 --> 00:12:50.980
<v Speaker 2>capitalist class maintains control.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so we must do away with it.</v>

264
00:12:51.550 --> 00:12:52.480
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's awful.</v>

265
00:12:52.940 --> 00:12:55.120
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's worse than off totalitarian.</v>

266
00:12:55.780 --> 00:12:59.290
<v Speaker 2>There's many arguments for saying that a</v>
<v Speaker 2>lot of pop culture is nonsense.</v>

267
00:12:59.291 --> 00:13:01.000
<v Speaker 2>It dribble.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I mock it constantly.</v>

268
00:13:01.300 --> 00:13:04.060
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but also people need an escape.</v>

269
00:13:04.090 --> 00:13:05.980
<v Speaker 2>It's also part of human nature.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

270
00:13:05.981 --> 00:13:06.814
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these are the things that rise up that </v>

271
00:13:08.260 --> 00:13:09.640
<v Speaker 2>had some resonance with people.</v>

272
00:13:09.700 --> 00:13:11.410
<v Speaker 2>I want to say it's better than an </v>
<v Speaker 2>escape.</v>

273
00:13:11.470 --> 00:13:15.340
<v Speaker 2>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of my work is about puritanism and</v>

274
00:13:15.341 --> 00:13:16.174
<v Speaker 2>its long history and people aren't </v>
<v Speaker 2>really aware of how it carries through </v>

275
00:13:18.881 --> 00:13:20.480
<v Speaker 2>to today.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the,</v>

276
00:13:20.490 --> 00:13:21.323
<v Speaker 2>that the heart of the pure of puritanism</v>
<v Speaker 2>is the puritan work ethic and a lot of </v>

277
00:13:24.071 --> 00:13:24.904
<v Speaker 2>people get confused about this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They think it's a working hard to get a </v>

278
00:13:26.861 --> 00:13:29.050
<v Speaker 2>nice house or a big television or a nice</v>
<v Speaker 2>car.</v>

279
00:13:29.051 --> 00:13:29.884
<v Speaker 2>It's not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's the idea that work in itself no </v>

280
00:13:32.201 --> 00:13:33.034
<v Speaker 2>matter what you get for it is virtuous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you should work all the time no </v>

281
00:13:36.101 --> 00:13:36.934
<v Speaker 2>matter what you get for it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm so popular culture in this country </v>

282
00:13:40.480 --> 00:13:42.290
<v Speaker 2>since it started in early 19th </v>
<v Speaker 2>centuries,</v>

283
00:13:42.310 --> 00:13:45.070
<v Speaker 2>always been an a and not just an escape </v>
<v Speaker 2>from that.</v>

284
00:13:45.340 --> 00:13:46.173
<v Speaker 2>It's been,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in a way a repudiation of that because </v>

285
00:13:47.711 --> 00:13:52.600
<v Speaker 2>the puritans and their descendants,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the victorians in the 19th century said,</v>

286
00:13:52.900 --> 00:13:54.130
<v Speaker 2>all these things are terrible.</v>

287
00:13:54.130 --> 00:13:56.770
<v Speaker 2>At that time it was dime novels,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which were the first novels,</v>

288
00:13:56.771 --> 00:13:59.380
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was going to the nickelodeons,</v>

289
00:13:59.410 --> 00:14:02.110
<v Speaker 2>it was gambling was going to the horse </v>
<v Speaker 2>races,</v>

290
00:14:02.111 --> 00:14:03.190
<v Speaker 2>sports,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all that stuff.</v>

291
00:14:03.191 --> 00:14:04.750
<v Speaker 2>They said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we can't do that.</v>

292
00:14:05.260 --> 00:14:06.460
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's evil.</v>

293
00:14:06.461 --> 00:14:08.650
<v Speaker 2>That's Satan's work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We must avoid that.</v>

294
00:14:08.680 --> 00:14:11.560
<v Speaker 2>We must work all the time and raise our </v>
<v Speaker 2>families and that's it.</v>

295
00:14:11.920 --> 00:14:12.753
<v Speaker 2>So popular culture for me has </v>
<v Speaker 2>essentially been a repudiation of the </v>

296
00:14:16.901 --> 00:14:17.734
<v Speaker 2>puritan work ethic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's always been this counter force </v>

297
00:14:21.041 --> 00:14:24.490
<v Speaker 2>against that in our culture and there's </v>
<v Speaker 2>this constant fight between the two.</v>

298
00:14:24.491 --> 00:14:26.680
<v Speaker 2>So you'll see,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like in politics,</v>

299
00:14:26.681 --> 00:14:27.514
<v Speaker 2>politicians,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you won't find a president or a senator </v>

300
00:14:29.231 --> 00:14:33.730
<v Speaker 2>until Donald trump actually who hasn't </v>
<v Speaker 2>criticised popular culture in some way.</v>

301
00:14:33.970 --> 00:14:35.500
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because they are.</v>

302
00:14:35.560 --> 00:14:39.760
<v Speaker 2>They have to be the models of the sort </v>
<v Speaker 2>of puritanical repressive.</v>

303
00:14:39.761 --> 00:14:42.040
<v Speaker 2>Good American guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Thanks a lot.</v>

304
00:14:42.180 --> 00:14:42.650
<v Speaker 2>Hi.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

305
00:14:42.650 --> 00:14:43.460
<v Speaker 2>sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

306
00:14:43.460 --> 00:14:43.691
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

307
00:14:43.691 --> 00:14:45.430
<v Speaker 2>that's great.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So is there,</v>

308
00:14:45.520 --> 00:14:46.353
<v Speaker 2>when you're discussing this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it sounds like there's a religious </v>

309
00:14:47.831 --> 00:14:50.730
<v Speaker 2>connotation there and when people hear </v>
<v Speaker 2>the word puritanical,</v>

310
00:14:50.960 --> 00:14:52.160
<v Speaker 2>they think of a religious</v>

311
00:14:52.160 --> 00:14:54.170
<v Speaker 1>connection,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but in and of itself,</v>

312
00:14:54.171 --> 00:14:56.030
<v Speaker 1>there isn't really a religious </v>
<v Speaker 1>connection,</v>

313
00:14:56.031 --> 00:14:56.510
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's,</v>

314
00:14:56.510 --> 00:15:00.590
<v Speaker 1>there's the ideas of a religious </v>
<v Speaker 1>authority or something like that,</v>

315
00:15:00.591 --> 00:15:01.910
<v Speaker 1>but it's not religious per se.</v>

316
00:15:01.990 --> 00:15:05.500
<v Speaker 2>It's not necessarily religious.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Another argument I make,</v>

317
00:15:05.560 --> 00:15:07.090
<v Speaker 2>and I think this might resonate with </v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

318
00:15:07.600 --> 00:15:08.433
<v Speaker 2>is that modern day progressivism and </v>
<v Speaker 2>left politics generally is secular </v>

319
00:15:12.581 --> 00:15:14.590
<v Speaker 2>religion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's really secular Christianity.</v>

320
00:15:14.620 --> 00:15:16.540
<v Speaker 2>So in particular,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

321
00:15:16.541 --> 00:15:17.800
<v Speaker 2>I think it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you see,</v>

322
00:15:17.801 --> 00:15:20.590
<v Speaker 2>you see,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you see a lot of puritanism in left wing</v>

323
00:15:20.591 --> 00:15:22.540
<v Speaker 2>politics and that's been true for a </v>
<v Speaker 2>long,</v>

324
00:15:22.541 --> 00:15:23.374
<v Speaker 2>long time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's actually a couple of very good </v>

325
00:15:24.851 --> 00:15:28.600
<v Speaker 2>books about um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>are showing that left wing intellectuals</v>

326
00:15:28.601 --> 00:15:29.434
<v Speaker 2>for the last hundred years have been a </v>
<v Speaker 2>uniformly hostile to popular culture </v>

327
00:15:33.130 --> 00:15:33.963
<v Speaker 2>that until very recently the sort of </v>
<v Speaker 2>hipster communists and Brooklyn talk </v>

328
00:15:37.060 --> 00:15:38.620
<v Speaker 2>about pop culture until them</v>

329
00:15:38.680 --> 00:15:41.160
<v Speaker 1>who all were the same glasses at the </v>
<v Speaker 1>same facial hair.</v>

330
00:15:41.240 --> 00:15:43.520
<v Speaker 2>They pretend they do and I've had </v>
<v Speaker 2>arguments with them.</v>

331
00:15:43.521 --> 00:15:47.210
<v Speaker 2>They picked hand that Lenin loved,</v>
<v Speaker 2>loved the movies.</v>

332
00:15:47.211 --> 00:15:48.460
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean Marx,</v>

333
00:15:48.470 --> 00:15:49.700
<v Speaker 2>Lenin,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Trotsky,</v>

334
00:15:50.030 --> 00:15:50.863
<v Speaker 2>all of them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you name it and all the intellectuals </v>

335
00:15:52.921 --> 00:15:55.790
<v Speaker 2>and the universities who are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who are on the left have all like Adorno</v>

336
00:15:55.820 --> 00:15:59.480
<v Speaker 2>have all hated pop culture and seeing it</v>
<v Speaker 2>as false consciousness.</v>

337
00:15:59.481 --> 00:16:00.314
<v Speaker 2>Because,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I said this once to professor at </v>

338
00:16:01.281 --> 00:16:04.100
<v Speaker 2>Columbia,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very prestigious feminist gender studies</v>

339
00:16:04.101 --> 00:16:05.720
<v Speaker 2>professor wants.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>

340
00:16:05.721 --> 00:16:06.920
<v Speaker 2>why?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why do you,</v>

341
00:16:07.040 --> 00:16:07.873
<v Speaker 2>why do you hate the fact that so many </v>
<v Speaker 2>women just like to go shopping or like </v>

342
00:16:10.880 --> 00:16:12.110
<v Speaker 2>to go to the movies?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And she said,</v>

343
00:16:12.740 --> 00:16:14.930
<v Speaker 2>because I think they have better things </v>
<v Speaker 2>to do with their time,</v>

344
00:16:15.830 --> 00:16:16.611
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

345
00:16:16.611 --> 00:16:20.630
<v Speaker 2>So that's judge.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's elitist,</v>

346
00:16:20.631 --> 00:16:23.480
<v Speaker 2>it's judgmental,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's at least authoritarian.</v>

347
00:16:23.481 --> 00:16:26.900
<v Speaker 2>I think it might be totalitarian.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And this is my critique of the Frankfurt</v>

348
00:16:26.901 --> 00:16:28.430
<v Speaker 2>school,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not postmodernism.</v>

349
00:16:28.520 --> 00:16:32.290
<v Speaker 2>Different things by the way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I do want to get very different things.</v>

350
00:16:32.310 --> 00:16:33.143
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to me it's totalitarian because their </v>

351
00:16:34.821 --> 00:16:38.660
<v Speaker 2>idea is that your ideas are wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 2>False.</v>

352
00:16:38.720 --> 00:16:41.960
<v Speaker 2>That's their term.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They use that and they're leading you to</v>

353
00:16:41.961 --> 00:16:44.780
<v Speaker 2>do things that are counter to your own </v>
<v Speaker 2>interests.</v>

354
00:16:44.900 --> 00:16:45.733
<v Speaker 2>So we know what your own interests are </v>
<v Speaker 2>and we know how you should best arrive </v>

355
00:16:50.211 --> 00:16:54.560
<v Speaker 2>at them to gain them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we're going to tell you what music to</v>

356
00:16:54.561 --> 00:16:56.930
<v Speaker 2>listen to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what movies to go see.</v>

357
00:16:56.931 --> 00:16:59.330
<v Speaker 2>Probably no movies,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but what you should do with your life,</v>

358
00:16:59.370 --> 00:17:00.260
<v Speaker 2>right time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

359
00:17:00.261 --> 00:17:02.000
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's actually totalitarian,</v>

360
00:17:02.270 --> 00:17:03.103
<v Speaker 2>which is why that crew,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the people who followed the Frankfurt </v>

361
00:17:05.871 --> 00:17:10.340
<v Speaker 2>school in the fifties and sixties,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the left wing movements that they became</v>

362
00:17:10.400 --> 00:17:12.490
<v Speaker 2>very attracted to during the time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

363
00:17:12.710 --> 00:17:17.710
<v Speaker 2>we're mallism with third world communism</v>
<v Speaker 2>because that's what Maoism looked like.</v>

364
00:17:17.810 --> 00:17:18.643
<v Speaker 2>It was this idea that we must rid </v>
<v Speaker 2>ourselves of our bad ideas before the </v>

365
00:17:22.791 --> 00:17:24.470
<v Speaker 2>revolution can happen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

366
00:17:24.730 --> 00:17:28.310
<v Speaker 2>it's fundamentally totalitarian.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's about the total person.</v>

367
00:17:28.560 --> 00:17:29.400
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Alright,</v>

368
00:17:29.430 --> 00:17:31.680
<v Speaker 1>so let's back up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's back up a couple of things.</v>

369
00:17:31.681 --> 00:17:33.120
<v Speaker 1>I think you're going to be bouncing </v>
<v Speaker 1>around a lot here,</v>

370
00:17:33.420 --> 00:17:34.253
<v Speaker 1>so I love this concept of what you said </v>
<v Speaker 1>that trump was the first one to reject </v>

371
00:17:36.991 --> 00:17:40.950
<v Speaker 1>this because during the election I think</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of people noticed and I think what</v>

372
00:17:40.951 --> 00:17:44.060
<v Speaker 1>people partly didn't like about Hillary </v>
<v Speaker 1>was the,</v>

373
00:17:44.080 --> 00:17:45.870
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she's on stage with Katy Perry.</v>

374
00:17:45.871 --> 00:17:48.060
<v Speaker 1>Then Madonna is doing a thing the day </v>
<v Speaker 1>before,</v>

375
00:17:48.210 --> 00:17:50.640
<v Speaker 1>like just this absolute connection</v>

376
00:17:50.640 --> 00:17:54.510
<v Speaker 2>between pop culture and politics that </v>
<v Speaker 2>started feeling gross.</v>

377
00:17:54.511 --> 00:17:55.344
<v Speaker 2>It started feeling like the powers that </v>
<v Speaker 2>be between entertainment and politics </v>

378
00:18:00.060 --> 00:18:00.893
<v Speaker 2>were so in bed together.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They all hated trump and I think that </v>

379
00:18:03.780 --> 00:18:04.613
<v Speaker 2>then boosted his support.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you think that's a fair estimate and </v>

380
00:18:08.790 --> 00:18:11.910
<v Speaker 2>do you think that was a calculated move </v>
<v Speaker 2>by him or was it just he had been pinned</v>

381
00:18:11.911 --> 00:18:12.744
<v Speaker 2>into a corner because nobody,</v>
<v Speaker 2>none of those people would back in </v>

382
00:18:14.221 --> 00:18:16.560
<v Speaker 2>except for a few of the deplorable </v>
<v Speaker 2>rejects.</v>

383
00:18:16.561 --> 00:18:18.920
<v Speaker 2>Like Ted nugent and Scott,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

384
00:18:18.930 --> 00:18:21.840
<v Speaker 2>I guess I don't have the same critique </v>
<v Speaker 2>of that that you do.</v>

385
00:18:21.900 --> 00:18:23.390
<v Speaker 2>I have no problem with what you said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it just.</v>

386
00:18:23.450 --> 00:18:24.283
<v Speaker 2>I take a different line on it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean to me Katy Perry and Madonna </v>

387
00:18:29.550 --> 00:18:34.170
<v Speaker 2>being front people for Hillary is a </v>
<v Speaker 2>contradiction because hillary represents</v>

388
00:18:34.171 --> 00:18:38.070
<v Speaker 2>second wave feminism,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which was read Betty for Dan,</v>

389
00:18:38.071 --> 00:18:40.380
<v Speaker 2>if you don't agree with me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean if you don't believe me,</v>

390
00:18:40.890 --> 00:18:45.890
<v Speaker 2>was a rejection of the objectification </v>
<v Speaker 2>of women in all forms,</v>

391
00:18:46.441 --> 00:18:46.710
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

392
00:18:46.710 --> 00:18:47.543
<v Speaker 2>So that any showing of skin,</v>
<v Speaker 2>any sexualization of women was bad and </v>

393
00:18:52.110 --> 00:18:52.943
<v Speaker 2>need to be left behind free.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dan said in her book the Feminine </v>

394
00:18:55.680 --> 00:18:58.860
<v Speaker 2>Mystique that women should become </v>
<v Speaker 2>leaders of corporations,</v>

395
00:18:59.010 --> 00:19:01.020
<v Speaker 2>leaders of government,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's it,</v>

396
00:19:01.021 --> 00:19:01.854
<v Speaker 2>and she.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She has several chapters in that book </v>

397
00:19:03.360 --> 00:19:04.193
<v Speaker 2>that are rejections of sex in particular</v>
<v Speaker 2>and also she attacks gay men for being </v>

398
00:19:10.380 --> 00:19:11.213
<v Speaker 2>eternal boys who were obsessed with sex </v>
<v Speaker 2>and for seducing housewives into being </v>

399
00:19:14.971 --> 00:19:17.640
<v Speaker 2>obsessed with sex.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This was free dance whole thing.</v>

400
00:19:17.641 --> 00:19:18.474
<v Speaker 2>She thought that women were themselves </v>
<v Speaker 2>too interested in sex and what they </v>

401
00:19:21.271 --> 00:19:24.990
<v Speaker 2>should be interested in was work </v>
<v Speaker 2>puritanism.</v>

402
00:19:25.110 --> 00:19:26.160
<v Speaker 2>Here you are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

403
00:19:26.490 --> 00:19:28.920
<v Speaker 2>And so Hillary Clinton is the apotheosis</v>
<v Speaker 2>of that,</v>

404
00:19:28.921 --> 00:19:29.550
<v Speaker 2>isn't she?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

405
00:19:29.550 --> 00:19:33.420
<v Speaker 2>Because she wears the business suits.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She is ultra rational,</v>

406
00:19:33.450 --> 00:19:36.810
<v Speaker 2>she is ultra disciplined.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She has her husband get sex elsewhere.</v>

407
00:19:36.811 --> 00:19:38.460
<v Speaker 2>If he does,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he does the bad stuff.</v>

408
00:19:38.850 --> 00:19:40.710
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so she is this,</v>

409
00:19:40.770 --> 00:19:42.420
<v Speaker 2>she's the perfect second wave feminists.</v>

410
00:19:42.660 --> 00:19:47.660
<v Speaker 2>So Katy Perry showing her boobs on stage</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>

411
00:19:47.761 --> 00:19:50.070
<v Speaker 2>Madonna having done the same thing </v>
<v Speaker 2>before.</v>

412
00:19:50.520 --> 00:19:51.353
<v Speaker 2>That's a rejection.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a contradiction of a second wave </v>

413
00:19:53.281 --> 00:19:56.520
<v Speaker 2>feminism.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So someone's not understanding something</v>

414
00:19:56.521 --> 00:19:57.354
<v Speaker 2>here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think Hillary does use them but </v>

415
00:19:58.351 --> 00:20:00.600
<v Speaker 2>probably isn't really a big fan of what </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're doing.</v>

416
00:20:00.670 --> 00:20:02.130
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you know,</v>

417
00:20:02.210 --> 00:20:04.020
<v Speaker 2>there there's something,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a contradiction that it needs to</v>

418
00:20:04.021 --> 00:20:06.270
<v Speaker 2>be resolved.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you think though that,</v>

419
00:20:06.271 --> 00:20:07.104
<v Speaker 2>that contradiction,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I think people see that even even </v>

420
00:20:09.330 --> 00:20:10.163
<v Speaker 2>if they don't understand the full </v>
<v Speaker 2>history of it or the full philosophical </v>

421
00:20:12.631 --> 00:20:13.464
<v Speaker 2>underpinnings,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think people kind of see that and I </v>

422
00:20:15.181 --> 00:20:18.420
<v Speaker 2>think that possibly did drive more </v>
<v Speaker 2>people to trump.</v>

423
00:20:18.421 --> 00:20:20.580
<v Speaker 2>Do you think that makes sense?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

424
00:20:20.880 --> 00:20:21.730
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

425
00:20:21.731 --> 00:20:25.490
<v Speaker 2>if it was a rejection of all of it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was just a rejection of just this,</v>

426
00:20:25.600 --> 00:20:27.030
<v Speaker 2>this monstrosity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I.</v>

427
00:20:27.031 --> 00:20:28.980
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that a lot of people,</v>

428
00:20:29.310 --> 00:20:30.570
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>

429
00:20:30.860 --> 00:20:31.260
<v Speaker 2>and people.</v>

430
00:20:31.260 --> 00:20:32.093
<v Speaker 2>I hate the way that people sort of </v>
<v Speaker 2>presumed to know what trump voters </v>

431
00:20:34.400 --> 00:20:36.690
<v Speaker 2>thought.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You better know everything otherwise,</v>

432
00:20:36.691 --> 00:20:38.040
<v Speaker 2>what the hell are we doing?</v>
<v Speaker 2>My name is Thaddeus.</v>

433
00:20:38.041 --> 00:20:40.460
<v Speaker 2>I better know they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

434
00:20:40.470 --> 00:20:42.960
<v Speaker 2>but I do think it's reasonable to assume</v>
<v Speaker 2>how's that,</v>

435
00:20:43.210 --> 00:20:44.043
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that a lot of them were rejecting or </v>

436
00:20:47.320 --> 00:20:48.153
<v Speaker 2>reacting to this repressive puritanism </v>
<v Speaker 2>in Clinton and politics generally that </v>

437
00:20:53.230 --> 00:20:55.480
<v Speaker 2>and which is not just cultural.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not just about sex,</v>

438
00:20:55.481 --> 00:20:56.314
<v Speaker 2>it's that you're not allowed to say all </v>
<v Speaker 2>kinds of things if you're an American </v>

439
00:20:59.201 --> 00:20:59.921
<v Speaker 2>politics.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

440
00:20:59.921 --> 00:21:03.700
<v Speaker 2>It's is very restricted discourse that's</v>
<v Speaker 2>allowed in American politics.</v>

441
00:21:03.701 --> 00:21:05.920
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure that was a lot of what went on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>

442
00:21:05.921 --> 00:21:08.980
<v Speaker 2>I did hear a lot of people say that </v>
<v Speaker 2>trump says what he thinks.</v>

443
00:21:09.070 --> 00:21:09.903
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just that was very attractive to a lot </v>

444
00:21:11.501 --> 00:21:16.501
<v Speaker 2>of people and that was attractive to me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't like most of what he said,</v>

445
00:21:16.870 --> 00:21:20.080
<v Speaker 2>but I did like that he was breaking down</v>
<v Speaker 2>the walls.</v>

446
00:21:20.110 --> 00:21:22.660
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And Bernie to some extent was doing that</v>

447
00:21:22.661 --> 00:21:23.560
<v Speaker 2>too,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

448
00:21:23.580 --> 00:21:24.413
<v Speaker 2>and so I thought that was very good even</v>
<v Speaker 2>though I didn't like either one of them </v>

449
00:21:26.351 --> 00:21:27.184
<v Speaker 2>in terms of their content,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I did like that they were simply </v>

450
00:21:29.261 --> 00:21:32.770
<v Speaker 2>challenging the walls.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you think that right there is sort of</v>

451
00:21:32.771 --> 00:21:35.020
<v Speaker 2>what the next evolution of politics is </v>
<v Speaker 2>going to be?</v>

452
00:21:35.021 --> 00:21:35.854
<v Speaker 2>Because I've been saying for awhile now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I feel like the chess board has just </v>

453
00:21:37.841 --> 00:21:40.270
<v Speaker 2>been thrown up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We've got fertile ground now.</v>

454
00:21:40.390 --> 00:21:41.800
<v Speaker 2>We don't know what's going to grow with </v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

455
00:21:41.801 --> 00:21:42.650
<v Speaker 2>I think there's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

456
00:21:42.700 --> 00:21:46.870
<v Speaker 2>the traditional labels of left,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right are becoming meaningless.</v>

457
00:21:46.871 --> 00:21:49.540
<v Speaker 2>What really is a Republican in the age </v>
<v Speaker 2>of trump,</v>

458
00:21:49.570 --> 00:21:52.090
<v Speaker 2>which is sort of a different thing than </v>
<v Speaker 2>conservatism,</v>

459
00:21:52.240 --> 00:21:53.073
<v Speaker 2>all of that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you think that the next wave of </v>

460
00:21:54.221 --> 00:21:56.980
<v Speaker 2>politics is really going to be about the</v>
<v Speaker 2>realignment?</v>

461
00:21:57.520 --> 00:21:58.360
<v Speaker 2>I hope this stuff.</v>

462
00:21:58.570 --> 00:21:59.600
<v Speaker 2>I hope so.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

463
00:21:59.710 --> 00:22:00.543
<v Speaker 2>I do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know,</v>

464
00:22:00.550 --> 00:22:03.010
<v Speaker 2>I know you've been talking about this a </v>
<v Speaker 2>lot on your show.</v>

465
00:22:03.011 --> 00:22:03.844
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>

466
00:22:04.240 --> 00:22:09.240
<v Speaker 2>this split between authoritarianism and </v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever you want to call it,</v>

467
00:22:10.330 --> 00:22:13.360
<v Speaker 2>libertarianism,</v>
<v Speaker 2>small l broadly conceived,</v>

468
00:22:13.410 --> 00:22:15.730
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what I hope.</v>

469
00:22:15.731 --> 00:22:16.564
<v Speaker 2>Do we need a better word for that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because I think because I do believe </v>

470
00:22:18.011 --> 00:22:18.844
<v Speaker 2>that's what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That is authoritarianism verse </v>

471
00:22:19.841 --> 00:22:22.500
<v Speaker 2>libertarianism.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I think when you say libertarianism,</v>

472
00:22:22.510 --> 00:22:23.343
<v Speaker 2>people think of it as some sort of </v>
<v Speaker 2>offshoot strange political parties </v>

473
00:22:26.020 --> 00:22:27.530
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is there a better phrase than mean?</v>

474
00:22:27.640 --> 00:22:28.473
<v Speaker 2>So for instance,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have many differences with </v>

475
00:22:29.861 --> 00:22:30.694
<v Speaker 2>libertarian,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so people often lumped me in with them </v>

476
00:22:32.231 --> 00:22:33.730
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but ask a libertarian,</v>

477
00:22:33.760 --> 00:22:34.593
<v Speaker 2>I mean that's like a hardcore </v>
<v Speaker 2>libertarian about fatty as Russell </v>

478
00:22:35.920 --> 00:22:36.340
<v Speaker 2>that's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

479
00:22:36.340 --> 00:22:39.130
<v Speaker 2>he's not a libertarian.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have many differences with them.</v>

480
00:22:39.131 --> 00:22:40.630
<v Speaker 2>Although in some things I very much </v>
<v Speaker 2>agree,</v>

481
00:22:40.690 --> 00:22:42.520
<v Speaker 2>but they're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

482
00:22:42.580 --> 00:22:44.500
<v Speaker 2>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

483
00:22:44.950 --> 00:22:48.640
<v Speaker 2>hostility to or opposition to the state </v>
<v Speaker 2>and state power.</v>

484
00:22:48.770 --> 00:22:50.530
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm completely with them on that.</v>

485
00:22:50.531 --> 00:22:55.510
<v Speaker 2>I think markets are very responsive to </v>
<v Speaker 2>consumers needs and I think they advance</v>

486
00:22:55.810 --> 00:22:57.340
<v Speaker 2>humanity in many,</v>
<v Speaker 2>many ways.</v>

487
00:22:57.341 --> 00:22:58.174
<v Speaker 2>I don't think they're perfect.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm think capitalism is perfect and </v>

488
00:22:59.651 --> 00:23:01.900
<v Speaker 2>that's one of their problems.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But anyway,</v>

489
00:23:01.901 --> 00:23:02.734
<v Speaker 2>I do think that general idea,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that basic idea that we should be free </v>

490
00:23:06.101 --> 00:23:09.100
<v Speaker 2>from control by others,</v>
<v Speaker 2>those in authority in particular,</v>

491
00:23:09.101 --> 00:23:12.040
<v Speaker 2>those with state power,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is the monopoly on violence,</v>

492
00:23:12.100 --> 00:23:13.550
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

493
00:23:13.630 --> 00:23:14.650
<v Speaker 2>is a good thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I,</v>

494
00:23:14.740 --> 00:23:15.573
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I love that about them and I love that </v>

495
00:23:17.021 --> 00:23:17.854
<v Speaker 2>about this sort of new formation I see </v>
<v Speaker 2>happening and you're a part of that and </v>

496
00:23:20.500 --> 00:23:21.333
<v Speaker 2>some of your guests are part of that </v>
<v Speaker 2>versus Democrats and Republicans who do </v>

497
00:23:25.270 --> 00:23:26.103
<v Speaker 2>wants to control us.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Liberals and conservatives who do want </v>

498
00:23:28.631 --> 00:23:29.464
<v Speaker 2>to control us in various ways.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would like to see a new realignment </v>

499
00:23:32.740 --> 00:23:33.573
<v Speaker 2>around that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would like to see us talk about </v>

500
00:23:34.571 --> 00:23:36.430
<v Speaker 2>politics in those terms because of right</v>
<v Speaker 2>and left.</v>

501
00:23:36.431 --> 00:23:37.264
<v Speaker 2>I think you're right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No longer make make much sense unless </v>

502
00:23:38.351 --> 00:23:40.120
<v Speaker 2>you're very specific about what you mean</v>
<v Speaker 2>by them.</v>

503
00:23:40.570 --> 00:23:42.970
<v Speaker 2>So we've talked a little bit more about </v>
<v Speaker 2>the left so far and you know,</v>

504
00:23:42.971 --> 00:23:45.190
<v Speaker 2>my feelings.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm trying as as a liberal,</v>

505
00:23:45.200 --> 00:23:46.190
<v Speaker 2>I'm trying to clean up</v>

506
00:23:46.550 --> 00:23:48.800
<v Speaker 1>what the left is and I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at this point,</v>

507
00:23:48.801 --> 00:23:52.490
<v Speaker 1>I don't think that being a liberal and </v>
<v Speaker 1>being on the left or even compatible,</v>

508
00:23:52.491 --> 00:23:53.324
<v Speaker 1>unfortunately.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But let's talk about the right a little </v>

509
00:23:54.471 --> 00:23:54.981
<v Speaker 1>bit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

510
00:23:54.981 --> 00:23:57.470
<v Speaker 1>What is right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Authoritarianism right now,</v>

511
00:23:57.750 --> 00:23:59.680
<v Speaker 2>right wing authoritarianism is sort of </v>
<v Speaker 2>what we know.</v>

512
00:23:59.681 --> 00:24:02.820
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's using the state to control </v>
<v Speaker 2>people's personal lives,</v>

513
00:24:03.900 --> 00:24:08.130
<v Speaker 2>so they don't want women to choose to be</v>
<v Speaker 2>able to choose abortions.</v>

514
00:24:08.131 --> 00:24:08.964
<v Speaker 2>They don't want us to actually.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're very concerned about popular </v>

515
00:24:11.941 --> 00:24:12.774
<v Speaker 2>culture,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so they want to control what we watch </v>

516
00:24:13.931 --> 00:24:17.100
<v Speaker 2>and listen to know they don't like a lot</v>
<v Speaker 2>of Hollywood.</v>

517
00:24:17.101 --> 00:24:19.740
<v Speaker 2>They don't like a lot of what happens in</v>
<v Speaker 2>the music industry.</v>

518
00:24:20.430 --> 00:24:21.263
<v Speaker 2>They've held marches and protests and </v>
<v Speaker 2>called for laws to censor those things </v>

519
00:24:24.340 --> 00:24:25.173
<v Speaker 2>and they also want to control what </v>
<v Speaker 2>happens in the rest of the world in </v>

520
00:24:27.331 --> 00:24:28.164
<v Speaker 2>various ways.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They want to send out the United States </v>

521
00:24:29.311 --> 00:24:31.950
<v Speaker 2>Army to control how people think and </v>
<v Speaker 2>behave.</v>

522
00:24:31.951 --> 00:24:33.810
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the thing is that lately,</v>

523
00:24:33.900 --> 00:24:34.960
<v Speaker 2>and I think again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is where,</v>

524
00:24:35.020 --> 00:24:36.360
<v Speaker 2>where you've been going a lot with your </v>
<v Speaker 2>show,</v>

525
00:24:36.361 --> 00:24:39.960
<v Speaker 2>is that there's been a convergence </v>
<v Speaker 2>between the conservatives,</v>

526
00:24:39.990 --> 00:24:41.520
<v Speaker 2>the Republicans,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the Liberals,</v>

527
00:24:41.521 --> 00:24:43.650
<v Speaker 2>the Democrats on many of these </v>
<v Speaker 2>questions.</v>

528
00:24:43.651 --> 00:24:45.810
<v Speaker 2>So for instance,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hip hop,</v>

529
00:24:45.900 --> 00:24:47.310
<v Speaker 2>here we go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Popular Culture,</v>

530
00:24:47.760 --> 00:24:51.780
<v Speaker 2>if you look at the reaction to hip hop </v>
<v Speaker 2>over the last 20 years,</v>

531
00:24:51.781 --> 00:24:53.950
<v Speaker 2>the negative reactions to the calls to </v>
<v Speaker 2>censor it,</v>

532
00:24:54.400 --> 00:24:55.233
<v Speaker 2>it was tipper Gore,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was a lot of feminists and it was </v>

533
00:24:58.770 --> 00:25:00.990
<v Speaker 2>Christian conservatives joining </v>
<v Speaker 2>together.</v>

534
00:25:01.020 --> 00:25:04.140
<v Speaker 2>Al Sharpton was another one who held </v>
<v Speaker 2>marches against hip hop,</v>

535
00:25:04.141 --> 00:25:07.290
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>calling for music companies to shut down</v>

536
00:25:07.291 --> 00:25:09.240
<v Speaker 2>these,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these artists and center the lyrics.</v>

537
00:25:09.241 --> 00:25:11.700
<v Speaker 2>So there's a lot of convergence around </v>
<v Speaker 2>this.</v>

538
00:25:11.701 --> 00:25:12.630
<v Speaker 2>Authoritarianism.</v>

539
00:25:12.910 --> 00:25:16.000
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So where does trump fit into that?</v>

540
00:25:16.570 --> 00:25:17.403
<v Speaker 1>Because he doesn't care about video game</v>
<v Speaker 1>violence or words that are in rap songs </v>

541
00:25:21.791 --> 00:25:22.624
<v Speaker 1>or even abortion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think he particularly cares </v>

542
00:25:24.641 --> 00:25:26.170
<v Speaker 1>about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Certainly not about gay marriage.</v>

543
00:25:26.290 --> 00:25:28.000
<v Speaker 1>So those things that are thought of as </v>
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>

544
00:25:28.001 --> 00:25:28.834
<v Speaker 1>authoritarianism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all these people that are marching with </v>

545
00:25:30.701 --> 00:25:31.534
<v Speaker 1>Hashtag resist or are they sort of </v>
<v Speaker 1>missing the boat on who they should be </v>

546
00:25:34.541 --> 00:25:35.090
<v Speaker 1>attacking?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

547
00:25:35.090 --> 00:25:39.350
<v Speaker 2>It would have been a great thing if he </v>
<v Speaker 2>had had more than two or three people in</v>

548
00:25:39.351 --> 00:25:42.610
<v Speaker 2>the world who agreed with him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're in Washington DC on these things,</v>

549
00:25:42.620 --> 00:25:45.110
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So unfortunately he brought just as tiny</v>

550
00:25:45.111 --> 00:25:47.960
<v Speaker 2>little crew to Washington and had to </v>
<v Speaker 2>fill all these posts,</v>

551
00:25:47.961 --> 00:25:48.794
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all these jobs and the only people </v>

552
00:25:50.151 --> 00:25:50.984
<v Speaker 2>available.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Unfortunately we're Christian </v>

553
00:25:52.581 --> 00:25:54.380
<v Speaker 2>conservatives and generals.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

554
00:25:54.381 --> 00:25:56.570
<v Speaker 2>And so what we have is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and Mike Pence,</v>

555
00:25:56.571 --> 00:25:57.404
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So Mike Pence comes from the Christian </v>

556
00:25:58.000 --> 00:26:02.350
<v Speaker 2>conservatives conservative wing and </v>
<v Speaker 2>they've gotten their,</v>

557
00:26:02.610 --> 00:26:04.370
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>their hold on him sessions.</v>

558
00:26:04.371 --> 00:26:05.450
<v Speaker 2>I think there's another one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

559
00:26:05.480 --> 00:26:09.560
<v Speaker 2>The who actually thinks that marijuana </v>
<v Speaker 2>is dangerous to people.</v>

560
00:26:09.561 --> 00:26:10.020
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

561
00:26:10.020 --> 00:26:10.853
<v Speaker 2>it's phenomenal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The guy is an absolute neanderthal and </v>

562
00:26:12.801 --> 00:26:13.634
<v Speaker 2>this stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I do think that he's not going to be </v>

563
00:26:15.621 --> 00:26:19.370
<v Speaker 2>successful because I think that that war</v>
<v Speaker 2>has been won by us,</v>

564
00:26:19.430 --> 00:26:20.091
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>

565
00:26:20.091 --> 00:26:21.620
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's,</v>

566
00:26:21.621 --> 00:26:23.720
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's unfortunate that trump,</v>

567
00:26:23.810 --> 00:26:24.643
<v Speaker 2>I think he feels beholden to them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He can't hold any power without the </v>

568
00:26:27.621 --> 00:26:31.640
<v Speaker 2>Christian conservative base.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so he's not being really forceful in</v>

569
00:26:31.641 --> 00:26:35.420
<v Speaker 2>his championing of popular culture,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which he comes right out of it.</v>

570
00:26:35.520 --> 00:26:35.921
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

571
00:26:35.921 --> 00:26:37.100
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look at who he is,</v>

572
00:26:37.120 --> 00:26:39.340
<v Speaker 1>he's the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's the zenith of it.</v>

573
00:26:39.750 --> 00:26:40.080
<v Speaker 1>Wife</v>

574
00:26:40.080 --> 00:26:41.880
<v Speaker 2>is a model and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all the rest of it.</v>

575
00:26:41.881 --> 00:26:42.620
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's.</v>

576
00:26:42.620 --> 00:26:43.590
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

577
00:26:43.591 --> 00:26:44.424
<v Speaker 2>So trump,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's one of the reasons I think </v>

578
00:26:45.391 --> 00:26:47.490
<v Speaker 2>that he makes people crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>

579
00:26:47.491 --> 00:26:50.310
<v Speaker 2>I actually think that's the main reason </v>
<v Speaker 2>he makes both sides.</v>

580
00:26:50.311 --> 00:26:53.100
<v Speaker 2>Liberals and conservatives absolutely </v>
<v Speaker 2>lose their stuff,</v>

581
00:26:53.130 --> 00:26:56.790
<v Speaker 2>which is that p is that he breaks those </v>
<v Speaker 2>rules.</v>

582
00:26:56.791 --> 00:26:58.440
<v Speaker 2>Cultural rules.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if you look at,</v>

583
00:26:58.441 --> 00:27:00.600
<v Speaker 2>if you look at puritanism,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>

584
00:27:00.660 --> 00:27:03.000
<v Speaker 2>what I was talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the work ethic,</v>

585
00:27:03.390 --> 00:27:06.540
<v Speaker 2>what does Donald Trump do?</v>
<v Speaker 2>He got a bunch of money from his dad and</v>

586
00:27:06.541 --> 00:27:09.030
<v Speaker 2>he kind of lives large on his private </v>
<v Speaker 2>jets.</v>

587
00:27:09.031 --> 00:27:10.070
<v Speaker 2>Everything is in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

588
00:27:10.110 --> 00:27:10.943
<v Speaker 2>everything is covered in gold and what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who does that other than Donald Trump </v>

589
00:27:14.100 --> 00:27:15.960
<v Speaker 2>rappers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you think about this,</v>

590
00:27:15.961 --> 00:27:18.390
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>He does a lot of the stuff that,</v>

591
00:27:18.391 --> 00:27:20.160
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the bad black people have done.</v>

592
00:27:20.161 --> 00:27:22.950
<v Speaker 2>They celebrate their bodies and they </v>
<v Speaker 2>don't care about,</v>

593
00:27:22.951 --> 00:27:23.784
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>conventional rules and norms and </v>

594
00:27:25.441 --> 00:27:26.850
<v Speaker 2>bourgeois morality and all that stuff.</v>

595
00:27:26.850 --> 00:27:28.170
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

596
00:27:28.171 --> 00:27:30.570
<v Speaker 2>he's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's not shy about talking about sex.</v>

597
00:27:30.571 --> 00:27:33.120
<v Speaker 2>That's also something you can't do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's an absolute taboo.</v>

598
00:27:33.121 --> 00:27:33.954
<v Speaker 2>He breaks all those cultural rules.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I actually think that's why they go </v>

599
00:27:36.931 --> 00:27:40.620
<v Speaker 2>crazy about Donald Trump in a bad way </v>
<v Speaker 2>because basically they don't know how to</v>

600
00:27:40.621 --> 00:27:43.500
<v Speaker 2>fight it because they are constrained by</v>
<v Speaker 2>sort of other rules.</v>

601
00:27:43.510 --> 00:27:44.343
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's so fundamental to who they are and </v>

602
00:27:46.350 --> 00:27:49.500
<v Speaker 2>what their world is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When we walk around in America,</v>

603
00:27:49.560 --> 00:27:53.070
<v Speaker 2>generally speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we don't talk about sex.</v>

604
00:27:53.430 --> 00:27:54.263
<v Speaker 2>We just don't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's the silence that we impose on </v>

605
00:27:56.131 --> 00:27:59.640
<v Speaker 2>ourselves.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We all are proud of when we work hard,</v>

606
00:27:59.641 --> 00:28:01.390
<v Speaker 2>even if we don't make a nickel for it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

607
00:28:01.860 --> 00:28:04.530
<v Speaker 2>It is so central to who we are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We've internalized it.</v>

608
00:28:04.531 --> 00:28:06.030
<v Speaker 2>It's not like people walk around saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

609
00:28:06.031 --> 00:28:07.800
<v Speaker 2>I'm a puritan,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and here's what the weirdest thing.</v>

610
00:28:08.310 --> 00:28:09.143
<v Speaker 2>It's just.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's completely deeply embedded inside </v>

611
00:28:10.351 --> 00:28:10.740
<v Speaker 2>of us.</v>

612
00:28:10.740 --> 00:28:11.573
<v Speaker 2>Since the puritans got here and that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>what trump just seems to not seem to be </v>

613
00:28:15.541 --> 00:28:16.374
<v Speaker 2>oblivious to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sort of that fundamental American </v>

614
00:28:18.661 --> 00:28:21.150
<v Speaker 2>culture and I would say it's really a </v>
<v Speaker 2>middle class culture,</v>

615
00:28:21.210 --> 00:28:22.043
<v Speaker 2>so working class people of all colors </v>
<v Speaker 2>have generally speaking and immigrants </v>

616
00:28:26.251 --> 00:28:30.450
<v Speaker 2>to have kind of avoided that stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They haven't internalized it,</v>

617
00:28:30.451 --> 00:28:31.284
<v Speaker 2>of course,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because they're sort of outside of the </v>

618
00:28:33.220 --> 00:28:35.460
<v Speaker 2>realm of power and they're outside of </v>
<v Speaker 2>citizenship.</v>

619
00:28:35.490 --> 00:28:37.440
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so for whatever reason,</v>

620
00:28:37.441 --> 00:28:40.200
<v Speaker 2>I don't know why trump is much more like</v>
<v Speaker 2>them,</v>

621
00:28:40.201 --> 00:28:41.034
<v Speaker 2>even though he's always been a rich kid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He sort of adopted that kind of working </v>

622
00:28:43.951 --> 00:28:48.780
<v Speaker 2>class indifference to Bush morality and </v>
<v Speaker 2>it people can't stand that.</v>

623
00:28:49.110 --> 00:28:49.943
<v Speaker 2>What does that tell you about politics?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sort of between the ideas and just the </v>

624
00:28:54.980 --> 00:28:56.600
<v Speaker 2>cult of personality?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

625
00:28:56.940 --> 00:28:58.650
<v Speaker 2>Someone that you obviously care about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>ideas,</v>

626
00:28:58.651 --> 00:28:59.870
<v Speaker 2>you have a command of the ideas.</v>

627
00:28:59.880 --> 00:29:00.713
<v Speaker 2>You were born out of certain ideas that </v>
<v Speaker 2>you later challenge and sort of </v>

628
00:29:03.241 --> 00:29:04.074
<v Speaker 2>incorporated into what you do now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but basically everything you said is </v>

629
00:29:06.670 --> 00:29:09.150
<v Speaker 2>this is just cultive personality of what</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's doing.</v>

630
00:29:09.740 --> 00:29:12.450
<v Speaker 2>There's a fundamental,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very depressing problem that I'm sort of</v>

631
00:29:12.451 --> 00:29:15.600
<v Speaker 2>just coming to grips with or coming to </v>
<v Speaker 2>terms with now in my own life,</v>

632
00:29:15.630 --> 00:29:17.700
<v Speaker 2>which is that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's sort of known this all along,</v>

633
00:29:17.701 --> 00:29:21.120
<v Speaker 2>but it's really hitting me hard,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that even with the Internet,</v>

634
00:29:21.180 --> 00:29:24.000
<v Speaker 2>even though I think people are better </v>
<v Speaker 2>informed now than ever before,</v>

635
00:29:24.001 --> 00:29:26.340
<v Speaker 2>because of that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the vast,</v>

636
00:29:26.341 --> 00:29:27.174
<v Speaker 2>vast,</v>
<v Speaker 2>vast majority of Americans don't know </v>

637
00:29:28.951 --> 00:29:29.784
<v Speaker 2>anything about politics.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's just even spending time on </v>

638
00:29:32.731 --> 00:29:33.564
<v Speaker 2>twitter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is a problem no matter what your </v>

639
00:29:35.071 --> 00:29:39.240
<v Speaker 2>politics are as a public political </v>
<v Speaker 2>person or a public intellectual,</v>

640
00:29:39.241 --> 00:29:40.890
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people don't even like that word.</v>

641
00:29:41.110 --> 00:29:42.310
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it,</v>

642
00:29:42.311 --> 00:29:43.144
<v Speaker 2>all it means is you're a lover of ideas </v>
<v Speaker 2>that you're curious about big ideas and </v>

643
00:29:46.031 --> 00:29:46.840
<v Speaker 2>you talk about ideas.</v>

644
00:29:46.840 --> 00:29:47.673
<v Speaker 2>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

645
00:29:47.680 --> 00:29:51.540
<v Speaker 2>people don't even like it when you use </v>
<v Speaker 2>that smug son of.</v>

646
00:29:51.700 --> 00:29:56.230
<v Speaker 2>I know I'd smug as the word had been </v>
<v Speaker 2>called recently more than once.</v>

647
00:29:56.980 --> 00:29:58.600
<v Speaker 2>It's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a problem.</v>

648
00:29:58.690 --> 00:30:00.160
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for what we do,</v>

649
00:30:00.220 --> 00:30:00.841
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

650
00:30:00.841 --> 00:30:01.674
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so that's why we have those of us in </v>

651
00:30:03.851 --> 00:30:05.980
<v Speaker 2>this little world talk to each other </v>
<v Speaker 2>most of the time.</v>

652
00:30:05.981 --> 00:30:06.840
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>

653
00:30:06.880 --> 00:30:09.760
<v Speaker 2>because most Americans have never heard </v>
<v Speaker 2>of Syria,</v>

654
00:30:10.510 --> 00:30:12.460
<v Speaker 2>much less know anything about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

655
00:30:12.850 --> 00:30:14.600
<v Speaker 2>most Americans.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

656
00:30:14.680 --> 00:30:15.513
<v Speaker 2>look at the polls.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just most Americans I think don't </v>

657
00:30:17.261 --> 00:30:19.030
<v Speaker 2>know who the vice president is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's something like that.</v>

658
00:30:19.031 --> 00:30:21.790
<v Speaker 2>I mean they can't identify Washington dc</v>
<v Speaker 2>on a map,</v>

659
00:30:22.230 --> 00:30:23.063
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>huge portions of the American public </v>

660
00:30:24.491 --> 00:30:26.110
<v Speaker 2>don't know anything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is,</v>

661
00:30:26.130 --> 00:30:26.963
<v Speaker 2>is that just a function of our success </v>
<v Speaker 2>that we are perhaps the most successful </v>

662
00:30:32.471 --> 00:30:34.510
<v Speaker 2>nation in the history of the world?</v>

663
00:30:34.950 --> 00:30:37.180
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we have done tremendous amounts of good.</v>

664
00:30:37.181 --> 00:30:39.190
<v Speaker 2>We've done plenty of bad at the same </v>
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>

665
00:30:39.191 --> 00:30:42.130
<v Speaker 2>We brought in more people from every </v>
<v Speaker 2>walk of life.</v>

666
00:30:42.131 --> 00:30:45.640
<v Speaker 2>All of these things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We've created this system that basically</v>

667
00:30:45.641 --> 00:30:50.641
<v Speaker 2>still is pretty great at what you get </v>
<v Speaker 2>out of that after the sausage is you get</v>

668
00:30:51.581 --> 00:30:52.414
<v Speaker 2>sort of dumb down thing because people </v>
<v Speaker 2>have video games and have leisure and </v>

669
00:30:57.371 --> 00:30:58.830
<v Speaker 2>sports and all of those things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

670
00:30:58.831 --> 00:31:00.530
<v Speaker 2>So I think those are good things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

671
00:31:00.720 --> 00:31:04.630
<v Speaker 2>I think it's pretty great and that </v>
<v Speaker 2>doesn't mean there aren't problems and I</v>

672
00:31:04.631 --> 00:31:07.060
<v Speaker 2>wish more people cared about ideas and </v>
<v Speaker 2>all that,</v>

673
00:31:07.300 --> 00:31:10.660
<v Speaker 2>but that it's just the function of </v>
<v Speaker 2>success is some of this.</v>

674
00:31:10.710 --> 00:31:12.640
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't need to care about stuff.</v>

675
00:31:12.641 --> 00:31:14.680
<v Speaker 2>You don't need to think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't need to read Co.</v>

676
00:31:15.930 --> 00:31:17.650
<v Speaker 2>You can start all you want about what he</v>
<v Speaker 2>thinks,</v>

677
00:31:17.651 --> 00:31:19.690
<v Speaker 2>but you don't need to read them because </v>
<v Speaker 2>no one does.</v>

678
00:31:19.690 --> 00:31:21.360
<v Speaker 2>So there's no one ever checks You on it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

679
00:31:21.410 --> 00:31:22.800
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that,</v>

680
00:31:24.370 --> 00:31:26.050
<v Speaker 2>so yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

681
00:31:26.051 --> 00:31:28.210
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like I often say to people like you</v>

682
00:31:28.211 --> 00:31:29.044
<v Speaker 2>and me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>

683
00:31:29.380 --> 00:31:30.213
<v Speaker 2>are we sure we want to be doing this </v>
<v Speaker 2>when we have a better time in a better </v>

684
00:31:32.651 --> 00:31:33.484
<v Speaker 2>life?</v>
<v Speaker 2>If we were just following sports </v>

685
00:31:34.931 --> 00:31:36.340
<v Speaker 2>instead.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I love sports.</v>

686
00:31:36.520 --> 00:31:38.890
<v Speaker 2>It's funny,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had jason whitlock from fox sports one</v>

687
00:31:38.891 --> 00:31:42.440
<v Speaker 2>on a couple of weeks ago and he was so </v>
<v Speaker 2>clearly passionate noses,</v>

688
00:31:42.520 --> 00:31:45.400
<v Speaker 2>thoughts and all that stuff about </v>
<v Speaker 2>politics and the wider world.</v>

689
00:31:45.670 --> 00:31:46.810
<v Speaker 2>And then when he left I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

690
00:31:46.811 --> 00:31:48.570
<v Speaker 2>that guy gets to talk about sports or </v>
<v Speaker 2>anything.</v>

691
00:31:48.571 --> 00:31:49.404
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that would be pretty great if I was an </v>

692
00:31:50.531 --> 00:31:52.870
<v Speaker 2>nba analysts,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we do love this.</v>

693
00:31:52.871 --> 00:31:53.860
<v Speaker 2>That's the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the,</v>

694
00:31:53.950 --> 00:31:54.850
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

695
00:31:54.880 --> 00:31:57.100
<v Speaker 2>aren't we can flip flop.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I love it.</v>

696
00:31:57.160 --> 00:31:58.690
<v Speaker 2>Well you do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you're also fortunate by it.</v>

697
00:31:58.870 --> 00:31:59.800
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's exhausting.</v>

698
00:31:59.801 --> 00:32:00.430
<v Speaker 2>when,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when,</v>

699
00:32:00.430 --> 00:32:04.840
<v Speaker 2>when articles and publications call me </v>
<v Speaker 2>an outright extremist or you know,</v>

700
00:32:04.841 --> 00:32:05.674
<v Speaker 2>and then I have to go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well now do I want to spend my day </v>

701
00:32:06.581 --> 00:32:08.950
<v Speaker 2>fighting this or just letting it be or.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it all,</v>

702
00:32:08.951 --> 00:32:10.330
<v Speaker 2>it's fighting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what it is.</v>

703
00:32:10.360 --> 00:32:11.193
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so half the time I love the fight </v>

704
00:32:12.101 --> 00:32:13.960
<v Speaker 2>and half the time I hate it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what else to say.</v>

705
00:32:13.961 --> 00:32:15.490
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what else I could do.</v>

706
00:32:15.550 --> 00:32:16.383
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would love to be like a boxing coach </v>

707
00:32:17.681 --> 00:32:19.450
<v Speaker 2>instead,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I don't think I can.</v>

708
00:32:19.451 --> 00:32:21.790
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd like to be in the nba,</v>

709
00:32:21.810 --> 00:32:23.060
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Probably not.</v>

710
00:32:23.320 --> 00:32:24.740
<v Speaker 2>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

711
00:32:24.790 --> 00:32:28.150
<v Speaker 2>jews used to dominate basketball.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know in this country.</v>

712
00:32:28.180 --> 00:32:28.820
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you do know this.</v>

713
00:32:28.820 --> 00:32:29.653
<v Speaker 2>I know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know.</v>

714
00:32:30.070 --> 00:32:32.240
<v Speaker 2>There were a lot of jews in the early </v>
<v Speaker 2>days of the mba.</v>

715
00:32:32.270 --> 00:32:33.103
<v Speaker 2>Now it's dominated.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's too late for dominated 40 with a </v>

716
00:32:35.441 --> 00:32:36.880
<v Speaker 2>badge,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so you could bring that back.</v>

717
00:32:36.960 --> 00:32:37.793
<v Speaker 2>You know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now that I think there are no jews and </v>

718
00:32:38.441 --> 00:32:40.760
<v Speaker 2>the mta.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can be the first and not one jew.</v>

719
00:32:40.761 --> 00:32:41.594
<v Speaker 2>That's pretty sad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've heard that Jordan farmar is half </v>

720
00:32:43.011 --> 00:32:44.910
<v Speaker 2>jewish.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's about it.</v>

721
00:32:45.690 --> 00:32:47.240
<v Speaker 2>They got them out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They found out.</v>

722
00:32:48.210 --> 00:32:51.010
<v Speaker 1>I think they actually sent it to Israel,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but total sidebar,</v>

723
00:32:51.200 --> 00:32:52.660
<v Speaker 1>but wait,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to focus a little more on that,</v>

724
00:32:52.720 --> 00:32:53.553
<v Speaker 1>on that right authority thing because it</v>
<v Speaker 1>isn't the part of the authoritarian </v>

725
00:32:57.251 --> 00:32:58.084
<v Speaker 1>stuff that I focus on a lot,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I do want to spend a little more </v>

726
00:33:00.371 --> 00:33:01.204
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They a part of it doesn't make sense to </v>

727
00:33:02.711 --> 00:33:03.544
<v Speaker 1>me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like it Seems to me that on something </v>

728
00:33:04.091 --> 00:33:08.680
<v Speaker 1>like gay marriage,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if the right that supposedly believes in</v>

729
00:33:08.681 --> 00:33:13.320
<v Speaker 1>states rights and in the individual and </v>
<v Speaker 1>in local limited government,</v>

730
00:33:13.330 --> 00:33:14.163
<v Speaker 1>all of those things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they had such an easy opportunity to do </v>

731
00:33:16.571 --> 00:33:18.940
<v Speaker 1>the right thing with gay marriage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

732
00:33:18.941 --> 00:33:21.640
<v Speaker 1>of course it got screwed up because of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the christian conservatives,</v>

733
00:33:21.850 --> 00:33:22.683
<v Speaker 1>but even right now with marijuana,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as you're talking about with jeff </v>

734
00:33:24.281 --> 00:33:26.770
<v Speaker 1>sessions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like you guys are the ones that are</v>

735
00:33:26.771 --> 00:33:31.771
<v Speaker 1>supposed to care about limited </v>
<v Speaker 1>government and not having the government</v>

736
00:33:32.081 --> 00:33:33.640
<v Speaker 1>tell people what they can do in their </v>
<v Speaker 1>own home.</v>

737
00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:36.790
<v Speaker 1>Why are they unable to take a principled</v>
<v Speaker 1>position here?</v>

738
00:33:36.960 --> 00:33:37.740
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

739
00:33:37.740 --> 00:33:38.970
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know about being.</v>

740
00:33:39.030 --> 00:33:39.631
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

741
00:33:39.631 --> 00:33:41.910
<v Speaker 2>I think for me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and did I lead too much?</v>

742
00:33:42.010 --> 00:33:42.211
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

743
00:33:42.211 --> 00:33:42.721
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

744
00:33:42.721 --> 00:33:43.554
<v Speaker 2>I think that conservative or republican </v>
<v Speaker 2>authoritarianism is different in a very </v>

745
00:33:48.031 --> 00:33:48.864
<v Speaker 2>important way and it's the reason that I</v>
<v Speaker 2>like you focus much more on left </v>

746
00:33:52.201 --> 00:33:54.960
<v Speaker 2>authoritarianism,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is that they are dumber.</v>

747
00:33:55.870 --> 00:33:56.703
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Really,</v>

748
00:33:57.030 --> 00:33:57.863
<v Speaker 2>they are less effective at getting </v>
<v Speaker 2>authoritarian politics out there and </v>

749
00:34:01.651 --> 00:34:05.250
<v Speaker 2>distributed and bought into the </v>
<v Speaker 2>sessions.</v>

750
00:34:05.251 --> 00:34:06.420
<v Speaker 2>This is what I was saying about </v>
<v Speaker 2>sessions,</v>

751
00:34:06.421 --> 00:34:07.680
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Good lUck buddy.</v>

752
00:34:07.830 --> 00:34:11.520
<v Speaker 2>Like convincing America to roll back </v>
<v Speaker 2>legalization of pot.</v>

753
00:34:11.640 --> 00:34:12.840
<v Speaker 2>It ain't gonna happen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

754
00:34:13.130 --> 00:34:13.963
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're certainly not going to convince </v>

755
00:34:15.241 --> 00:34:16.500
<v Speaker 2>anyone of this stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

756
00:34:16.501 --> 00:34:17.334
<v Speaker 2>no one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no one believes other than jeff </v>

757
00:34:18.421 --> 00:34:19.500
<v Speaker 2>sessions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Really.</v>

758
00:34:19.560 --> 00:34:22.650
<v Speaker 2>That pot is harmful to you in the way </v>
<v Speaker 2>that he's talking about.</v>

759
00:34:23.120 --> 00:34:24.140
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but then yeah,</v>

760
00:34:24.160 --> 00:34:24.993
<v Speaker 1>what does that say that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that even president obama was still </v>

761
00:34:28.121 --> 00:34:31.940
<v Speaker 1>having the feds shut down the local </v>
<v Speaker 1>things like here in college.</v>

762
00:34:32.160 --> 00:34:34.260
<v Speaker 2>That is my point.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That is exactly what I'm saying here.</v>

763
00:34:34.261 --> 00:34:35.094
<v Speaker 2>So the sessions won't be able to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Obama could because everybody loved </v>

764
00:34:38.581 --> 00:34:39.414
<v Speaker 2>obama because obama played by all the </v>
<v Speaker 2>rules because he was the perfect </v>

765
00:34:42.151 --> 00:34:46.980
<v Speaker 2>american man and he was black and so he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he kInd of fixed our are bad history for</v>

766
00:34:46.981 --> 00:34:48.450
<v Speaker 2>us too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He made us feel better.</v>

767
00:34:48.451 --> 00:34:49.890
<v Speaker 2>He was our salvation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was,</v>

768
00:34:49.950 --> 00:34:52.050
<v Speaker 2>he was perfect.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was almost a jesus fIgure.</v>

769
00:34:52.470 --> 00:34:55.170
<v Speaker 2>And that's real and I mean that people </v>
<v Speaker 2>really did treat him that way.</v>

770
00:34:55.171 --> 00:34:57.930
<v Speaker 2>And I don't think that's an exaggeration</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you look at it right.</v>

771
00:34:58.610 --> 00:34:59.443
<v Speaker 2>And so he could send in the feds to shut</v>
<v Speaker 2>down marijuana dispensaries and no one </v>

772
00:35:03.871 --> 00:35:06.570
<v Speaker 2>batted an eye certainly on the left.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But why did he.</v>

773
00:35:06.780 --> 00:35:07.470
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why did.</v>

774
00:35:07.470 --> 00:35:09.530
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I see what you're saying on the one that</v>

775
00:35:09.531 --> 00:35:11.940
<v Speaker 1>he can get away with it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But why do you think he did?</v>

776
00:35:11.941 --> 00:35:14.580
<v Speaker 1>If most likely he doesn't really care </v>
<v Speaker 1>about</v>

777
00:35:15.140 --> 00:35:16.630
<v Speaker 2>marIjuana laws,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do you think?</v>

778
00:35:16.730 --> 00:35:17.870
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

779
00:35:17.871 --> 00:35:20.060
<v Speaker 2>I would say that he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

780
00:35:20.210 --> 00:35:21.043
<v Speaker 2>like people in the progressive left and </v>
<v Speaker 2>I include liberals in this are </v>

781
00:35:25.611 --> 00:35:28.910
<v Speaker 2>interested primarily in social control,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so they need.</v>

782
00:35:28.911 --> 00:35:29.790
<v Speaker 2>And that's not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't,</v>

783
00:35:29.970 --> 00:35:32.690
<v Speaker 2>that's not saying that they're evil,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's just who they are.</v>

784
00:35:32.720 --> 00:35:36.380
<v Speaker 2>They like a well ordered society,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I don't know,</v>

785
00:35:36.410 --> 00:35:39.810
<v Speaker 2>but I would suspect and look at obama,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's like the paragon of discipline,</v>

786
00:35:39.811 --> 00:35:40.644
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>He is actually the perfect pure attend </v>

787
00:35:41.371 --> 00:35:43.070
<v Speaker 2>at least as far as we know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

788
00:35:43.610 --> 00:35:44.443
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would say that part of it that he </v>

789
00:35:45.961 --> 00:35:46.794
<v Speaker 2>didn't like the fact that people were </v>
<v Speaker 2>violating federal law and I think </v>

790
00:35:49.711 --> 00:35:52.050
<v Speaker 2>getting high,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think he now sees as,</v>

791
00:35:52.120 --> 00:35:53.610
<v Speaker 2>as disruptive,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

792
00:35:53.611 --> 00:35:55.010
<v Speaker 2>It's not a good thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

793
00:35:55.740 --> 00:35:58.050
<v Speaker 2>so look at his sermons.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Here you go.</v>

794
00:35:58.140 --> 00:36:00.690
<v Speaker 2>Sermons or lectures or speeches,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever you want to call them.</v>

795
00:36:00.840 --> 00:36:04.020
<v Speaker 2>Interesting choice against black </v>
<v Speaker 2>culture,</v>

796
00:36:04.200 --> 00:36:06.360
<v Speaker 2>which people sort of don't pay attention</v>
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>

797
00:36:06.361 --> 00:36:07.194
<v Speaker 2>but he gave many.</v>
<v Speaker 2>every time the guy got in front of a </v>

798
00:36:08.791 --> 00:36:09.624
<v Speaker 2>black audience,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he would start lecturing them about </v>

799
00:36:12.031 --> 00:36:12.864
<v Speaker 2>watching too much espn and about how </v>
<v Speaker 2>they needed to pull up their pants and </v>

800
00:36:15.631 --> 00:36:18.330
<v Speaker 2>how much,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how they needed to work harder and raise</v>

801
00:36:18.331 --> 00:36:19.141
<v Speaker 2>their children.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

802
00:36:19.141 --> 00:36:20.610
<v Speaker 2>And stop eating.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Popeye's chicken,</v>

803
00:36:20.760 --> 00:36:22.860
<v Speaker 2>google it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean he went and michelle did the same</v>

804
00:36:22.861 --> 00:36:26.220
<v Speaker 2>thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this really stern admonitions of,</v>

805
00:36:26.250 --> 00:36:30.090
<v Speaker 2>of black culture.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I think that's all of the piece.</v>

806
00:36:30.091 --> 00:36:34.830
<v Speaker 2>I think that's probably plays into why </v>
<v Speaker 2>he did go after the dispensary's.</v>

807
00:36:35.200 --> 00:36:36.033
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

808
00:36:36.230 --> 00:36:37.430
<v Speaker 1>got it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot there.</v>

809
00:36:37.431 --> 00:36:38.264
<v Speaker 1>So where we started before we went on </v>
<v Speaker 1>this 20 minutes a roundabout was I was </v>

810
00:36:42.800 --> 00:36:44.320
<v Speaker 1>mentioning the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

811
00:36:44.370 --> 00:36:45.750
<v Speaker 1>the outcasts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of the,</v>

812
00:36:45.780 --> 00:36:46.613
<v Speaker 1>the drunks and all those people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then I said it was sorta like some </v>

813
00:36:49.971 --> 00:36:50.804
<v Speaker 1>of the people that were in your house </v>
<v Speaker 1>growing up and you were making a </v>

814
00:36:52.611 --> 00:36:54.380
<v Speaker 1>distinction that those are not the same </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>

815
00:36:54.381 --> 00:36:55.780
<v Speaker 1>So let's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's go back to that.</v>

816
00:36:55.781 --> 00:36:56.990
<v Speaker 1>That was good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had it there.</v>

817
00:36:56.991 --> 00:36:59.000
<v Speaker 1>I knew we were going to get.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was very good.</v>

818
00:36:59.850 --> 00:37:00.740
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

819
00:37:00.950 --> 00:37:01.530
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

820
00:37:01.530 --> 00:37:02.363
<v Speaker 2>the communists in my house growing up </v>
<v Speaker 2>were puritanical because as I said </v>

821
00:37:06.481 --> 00:37:07.314
<v Speaker 2>earlier,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

822
00:37:07.500 --> 00:37:09.660
<v Speaker 2>communists and socialists have always </v>
<v Speaker 2>been puritanical.</v>

823
00:37:09.690 --> 00:37:10.523
<v Speaker 2>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is lots of literature has been </v>

824
00:37:11.701 --> 00:37:13.260
<v Speaker 2>written on this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is not just me talking.</v>

825
00:37:13.860 --> 00:37:17.340
<v Speaker 2>I'm lennon and marks were po,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sorry,</v>

826
00:37:17.341 --> 00:37:18.174
<v Speaker 2>lenin and trotsky were opposed to </v>
<v Speaker 2>homosexuality because homosexuality was </v>

827
00:37:22.501 --> 00:37:25.800
<v Speaker 2>sort of being bad in itself,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but because it was decadent,</v>

828
00:37:26.260 --> 00:37:30.630
<v Speaker 2>so decadence was the problem for </v>
<v Speaker 2>communists throughout the 20th century.</v>

829
00:37:31.380 --> 00:37:32.213
<v Speaker 2>They thought like adorno did later,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that it was this thing that was leading </v>

830
00:37:35.761 --> 00:37:37.010
<v Speaker 2>the working class,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the decadence,</v>

831
00:37:37.110 --> 00:37:37.943
<v Speaker 2>popular culture,</v>
<v Speaker 2>consumerism was leading the working </v>

832
00:37:39.900 --> 00:37:40.733
<v Speaker 2>class astray with the working class </v>
<v Speaker 2>should be doing instead was organizing </v>

833
00:37:43.711 --> 00:37:46.440
<v Speaker 2>themselves for revolution.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now here's what they understood,</v>

834
00:37:46.810 --> 00:37:48.700
<v Speaker 2>and this is why it's all logical.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

835
00:37:48.750 --> 00:37:53.130
<v Speaker 2>they understood that when you control or</v>
<v Speaker 2>manage a whole society,</v>

836
00:37:53.131 --> 00:37:54.780
<v Speaker 2>which is what they wanted everyone to </v>
<v Speaker 2>do,</v>

837
00:37:55.200 --> 00:37:56.670
<v Speaker 2>that requires tremendous discipline.</v>

838
00:37:56.850 --> 00:37:59.910
<v Speaker 2>You can't be going to the movies if </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're going to be managing the economy.</v>

839
00:38:00.120 --> 00:38:01.770
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so that's what they said.</v>

840
00:38:01.771 --> 00:38:03.450
<v Speaker 2>And I mean this was the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this was their argument.</v>

841
00:38:03.480 --> 00:38:07.140
<v Speaker 2>We need to instill this perfect </v>
<v Speaker 2>proletarian discipline.</v>

842
00:38:07.141 --> 00:38:10.530
<v Speaker 2>It wasn't the phrase in the soviet union</v>
<v Speaker 2>and elsewhere,</v>

843
00:38:10.800 --> 00:38:14.420
<v Speaker 2>and so my parents comrades came out of </v>
<v Speaker 2>that tradition.</v>

844
00:38:14.421 --> 00:38:15.780
<v Speaker 2>They were trotskyists,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

845
00:38:15.810 --> 00:38:17.460
<v Speaker 2>they came out of that and they </v>
<v Speaker 2>understood that,</v>

846
00:38:17.490 --> 00:38:21.150
<v Speaker 2>so they may have watched some television</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they didn't.</v>

847
00:38:21.210 --> 00:38:23.490
<v Speaker 2>they thought at best it was just an </v>
<v Speaker 2>escape.</v>

848
00:38:23.610 --> 00:38:24.443
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And what we really need to be doing is </v>

849
00:38:26.220 --> 00:38:28.650
<v Speaker 2>studying gdp figures,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

850
00:38:28.651 --> 00:38:30.270
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so that we can manage the economy.</v>

851
00:38:30.271 --> 00:38:31.104
<v Speaker 2>Everyone should be doIng that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everyone should be an engineer and </v>

852
00:38:33.571 --> 00:38:36.820
<v Speaker 2>everyone should be ready to have </v>
<v Speaker 2>meetings all day long and all night long</v>

853
00:38:37.000 --> 00:38:37.833
<v Speaker 2>to organize our society.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's so interesting because I don't </v>

854
00:38:41.090 --> 00:38:43.270
<v Speaker 2>as you're saying that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was thinking that recently.</v>

855
00:38:43.270 --> 00:38:46.990
<v Speaker 2>I've been saying this thing about how </v>
<v Speaker 2>comedy I think is dying right now too,</v>

856
00:38:47.380 --> 00:38:49.900
<v Speaker 2>that there are in comics willing to </v>
<v Speaker 2>cross the line.</v>

857
00:38:49.901 --> 00:38:50.734
<v Speaker 2>We've got bill maher apologizing for a </v>
<v Speaker 2>word even though no one in their right </v>

858
00:38:53.051 --> 00:38:53.884
<v Speaker 2>mind thinks he's racist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>we've seen so many leftist progressive </v>

859
00:38:57.490 --> 00:38:58.323
<v Speaker 2>comedians just making the same trump </v>
<v Speaker 2>jokes over again and not really pushing </v>

860
00:39:01.691 --> 00:39:05.080
<v Speaker 2>the limits of what comedy is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But with what you're saying,</v>

861
00:39:05.081 --> 00:39:08.200
<v Speaker 2>it really does make sense why they </v>
<v Speaker 2>almost can't be funny.</v>

862
00:39:08.260 --> 00:39:12.430
<v Speaker 2>This is what I've been saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that these progressives who are shutting</v>

863
00:39:12.431 --> 00:39:16.870
<v Speaker 2>down pop culture in these ways are true </v>
<v Speaker 2>to their heritage.</v>

864
00:39:17.140 --> 00:39:19.720
<v Speaker 2>This is what progressives,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean the progressives,</v>

865
00:39:19.721 --> 00:39:21.430
<v Speaker 2>the original ones that the early 20th </v>
<v Speaker 2>century.</v>

866
00:39:21.431 --> 00:39:26.260
<v Speaker 2>did they shut down the nickelodeons they</v>
<v Speaker 2>did they in every city in the country.</v>

867
00:39:26.261 --> 00:39:27.094
<v Speaker 2>ProgressIve's launch these campaigns.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Can you just tell people what </v>

868
00:39:28.691 --> 00:39:29.524
<v Speaker 2>nickelodeon's are?</v>

869
00:39:29.950 --> 00:39:30.783
<v Speaker 2>Because a lot of people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My younger audience is going to think </v>

870
00:39:31.991 --> 00:39:34.390
<v Speaker 2>you mean with the green.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But that's not what you mean.</v>

871
00:39:34.450 --> 00:39:35.283
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The nickelodeon network is named after </v>

872
00:39:38.620 --> 00:39:41.650
<v Speaker 2>the cinemas in which started in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>lower east side of New York,</v>

873
00:39:41.651 --> 00:39:43.900
<v Speaker 2>but grew and spread all over the </v>
<v Speaker 2>country,</v>

874
00:39:44.170 --> 00:39:47.290
<v Speaker 2>which were a five cent cinemas.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You could go and put a nickel in and you</v>

875
00:39:47.291 --> 00:39:48.230
<v Speaker 2>could watch a movie.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

876
00:39:48.300 --> 00:39:49.133
<v Speaker 2>So I'm sure they would probably want to </v>
<v Speaker 2>go after the green room at some point </v>

877
00:39:50.681 --> 00:39:51.514
<v Speaker 2>too,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because there's got to be some racial </v>

878
00:39:52.001 --> 00:39:52.834
<v Speaker 2>connotation to that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the progressIve is in all the big </v>

879
00:39:56.351 --> 00:39:57.184
<v Speaker 2>cities.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Shut down those nickelodeon's because </v>

880
00:39:57.881 --> 00:40:00.130
<v Speaker 2>the working class was watching </v>
<v Speaker 2>burlesque,</v>

881
00:40:00.340 --> 00:40:01.270
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or you know,</v>

882
00:40:01.271 --> 00:40:03.160
<v Speaker 2>just or things that weren't about work </v>
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>

883
00:40:03.161 --> 00:40:05.650
<v Speaker 2>discipline and war.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

884
00:40:05.950 --> 00:40:07.120
<v Speaker 2>and so yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

885
00:40:07.330 --> 00:40:08.650
<v Speaker 2>they're being true to their heritage.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

886
00:40:08.651 --> 00:40:11.980
<v Speaker 2>We should have culture that is </v>
<v Speaker 2>completely austere,</v>

887
00:40:12.280 --> 00:40:12.610
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

888
00:40:12.610 --> 00:40:17.610
<v Speaker 2>And not fun or funny in those ways.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's why the is so unfunny right?</v>

889
00:40:18.641 --> 00:40:19.361
<v Speaker 2>Think about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

890
00:40:19.361 --> 00:40:20.194
<v Speaker 2>they're so earnest.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're so earnest that they can't make </v>

891
00:40:22.631 --> 00:40:23.201
<v Speaker 2>a joke.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

892
00:40:23.201 --> 00:40:24.034
<v Speaker 2>that's the thIng.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They've been birth pepe and tech and </v>

893
00:40:27.850 --> 00:40:28.683
<v Speaker 2>Pakistan and all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They birthed it because it's these </v>

894
00:40:30.340 --> 00:40:33.740
<v Speaker 2>people online that have Just had it with</v>
<v Speaker 2>the political correctness.</v>

895
00:40:33.850 --> 00:40:34.683
<v Speaker 2>So noW they're sending out frogs with </v>
<v Speaker 2>swastika is just to get a reaction out </v>

896
00:40:38.381 --> 00:40:40.540
<v Speaker 2>of people and people that think it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>hate speech.</v>

897
00:40:40.600 --> 00:40:41.433
<v Speaker 2>I had horses,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had gavin mcinnes on my show and you </v>

898
00:40:44.040 --> 00:40:44.873
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it became very clear to me about five </v>

899
00:40:45.701 --> 00:40:48.310
<v Speaker 2>minutes in this is what's happening.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's hilarious.</v>

900
00:40:48.960 --> 00:40:53.770
<v Speaker 2>much oF what he says is either racist or</v>
<v Speaker 2>pretty damn close.</v>

901
00:40:54.310 --> 00:40:57.400
<v Speaker 2>And the content of what he's saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have a lot of trouble with.</v>

902
00:40:57.401 --> 00:40:59.830
<v Speaker 2>I don't know how serious he is about it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's,</v>

903
00:40:59.860 --> 00:41:00.693
<v Speaker 2>it's clearly right wing in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in pretty bad ways according to my </v>

904
00:41:03.881 --> 00:41:04.714
<v Speaker 2>politics.</v>

905
00:41:04.810 --> 00:41:06.370
<v Speaker 2>But he's really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>really funny.</v>

906
00:41:06.520 --> 00:41:10.570
<v Speaker 2>He has the freedom to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Comedy requires freedom.</v>

907
00:41:11.200 --> 00:41:13.330
<v Speaker 2>Jim goad is another one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

908
00:41:13.360 --> 00:41:15.010
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he just approached me.</v>

909
00:41:15.011 --> 00:41:15.844
<v Speaker 2>He wants to be on my podcast and he.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But he and I started looking at his </v>

910
00:41:17.681 --> 00:41:21.670
<v Speaker 2>writing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Much of what he says is probably racist.</v>

911
00:41:21.790 --> 00:41:24.220
<v Speaker 2>Probably sexist,</v>
<v Speaker 2>probably homophobic,</v>

912
00:41:24.760 --> 00:41:26.080
<v Speaker 2>but he's hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's very,</v>

913
00:41:26.081 --> 00:41:28.300
<v Speaker 2>very funny.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what do you do?</v>

914
00:41:28.450 --> 00:41:31.510
<v Speaker 2>What I want to ask you that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what do you do with that?</v>

915
00:41:31.540 --> 00:41:32.373
<v Speaker 2>You personally,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what do you do with that when you're </v>

916
00:41:33.441 --> 00:41:36.080
<v Speaker 2>sitting across from someone like that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

917
00:41:36.081 --> 00:41:39.590
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I laugh and I'm troubled and I feel like</v>

918
00:41:39.591 --> 00:41:41.670
<v Speaker 2>if they are not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>However I feel like if they,</v>

919
00:41:41.680 --> 00:41:44.780
<v Speaker 2>like with gavin mcinnes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he has no real power,</v>

920
00:41:45.080 --> 00:41:45.651
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

921
00:41:45.651 --> 00:41:48.410
<v Speaker 2>no one's gonna listen to him and write </v>
<v Speaker 2>some policy based on this.</v>

922
00:41:49.030 --> 00:41:50.300
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

923
00:41:50.301 --> 00:41:52.370
<v Speaker 2>you could say he contributes to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>trump phenomenon,</v>

924
00:41:52.371 --> 00:41:54.080
<v Speaker 2>but what's the trump phenomenon?</v>

925
00:41:54.080 --> 00:41:55.820
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there is no trump phenomenon anymore.</v>

926
00:41:55.821 --> 00:41:57.770
<v Speaker 2>The generals have taken over basically,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

927
00:41:57.800 --> 00:41:59.170
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

928
00:41:59.240 --> 00:42:00.073
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>once they attach themselves to any </v>

929
00:42:02.271 --> 00:42:07.271
<v Speaker 2>movement that might seize state power,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh then give me an ak 47,</v>

930
00:42:07.840 --> 00:42:10.400
<v Speaker 2>but they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these guys are so marginalized.</v>

931
00:42:10.460 --> 00:42:11.293
<v Speaker 2>People talk about being marginalized,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the marginalized or those guys and what </v>

932
00:42:14.541 --> 00:42:16.670
<v Speaker 2>they represent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's so interesting you say that because</v>

933
00:42:16.671 --> 00:42:20.540
<v Speaker 2>that's the other reason that I focus on </v>
<v Speaker 2>the left is not just because I come from</v>

934
00:42:20.541 --> 00:42:21.374
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but also because I see that's where all </v>

935
00:42:22.851 --> 00:42:23.684
<v Speaker 2>the power is seated the conversation and</v>
<v Speaker 2>see seated their hollywood is all those </v>

936
00:42:26.481 --> 00:42:27.830
<v Speaker 2>things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So when they get,</v>

937
00:42:27.890 --> 00:42:28.570
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

938
00:42:28.570 --> 00:42:29.403
<v Speaker 2>the three white supremacists to show up </v>
<v Speaker 2>at a meeting somewhere and then of </v>

939
00:42:32.451 --> 00:42:33.284
<v Speaker 2>course the media blows it out of </v>
<v Speaker 2>proportion as if there's nazis re </v>

940
00:42:35.840 --> 00:42:39.590
<v Speaker 2>rampaging through the streets.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like you just need that,</v>

941
00:42:39.650 --> 00:42:40.970
<v Speaker 2>need,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that belief.</v>

942
00:42:41.000 --> 00:42:42.410
<v Speaker 2>Do you think that's a fair?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

943
00:42:42.411 --> 00:42:43.280
<v Speaker 2>absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>

944
00:42:43.281 --> 00:42:43.610
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

945
00:42:43.610 --> 00:42:44.031
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

946
00:42:44.031 --> 00:42:46.850
<v Speaker 2>so they control most of the media.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just true.</v>

947
00:42:47.010 --> 00:42:48.770
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>liberals,</v>

948
00:42:48.830 --> 00:42:50.650
<v Speaker 2>liberals mostly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not really socialists,</v>

949
00:42:50.660 --> 00:42:51.493
<v Speaker 2>but liberals controlled the media for </v>
<v Speaker 2>the most part other than fox news and </v>

950
00:42:54.021 --> 00:42:54.854
<v Speaker 2>fox.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's.</v>

951
00:42:54.880 --> 00:42:55.713
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>by the way,</v>

952
00:42:55.880 --> 00:42:57.560
<v Speaker 2>if you've ever been in the fox news </v>
<v Speaker 2>green room,</v>

953
00:42:57.561 --> 00:43:00.020
<v Speaker 2>you'll know that there's a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 2>liberals who even worked there,</v>

954
00:43:00.710 --> 00:43:02.150
<v Speaker 2>the people behind the scenes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's tons.</v>

955
00:43:02.151 --> 00:43:05.330
<v Speaker 2>I knew gay people that work there and </v>
<v Speaker 2>all sorts of New York city,</v>

956
00:43:05.331 --> 00:43:06.810
<v Speaker 2>upper west side.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>

957
00:43:06.870 --> 00:43:07.703
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they control academia and they </v>

958
00:43:10.941 --> 00:43:13.070
<v Speaker 2>control what's now being called the deep</v>
<v Speaker 2>state,</v>

959
00:43:13.100 --> 00:43:13.731
<v Speaker 2>whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

960
00:43:13.731 --> 00:43:16.490
<v Speaker 2>if that's whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you know,</v>

961
00:43:16.491 --> 00:43:17.324
<v Speaker 2>in terms of the civil servants who work </v>
<v Speaker 2>in Washington dc and working all the </v>

962
00:43:20.241 --> 00:43:21.620
<v Speaker 2>state capitals,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's over.</v>

963
00:43:21.621 --> 00:43:25.040
<v Speaker 2>We know this is overwhelmingly liberal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So yeah,</v>

964
00:43:25.160 --> 00:43:29.300
<v Speaker 2>this is why I get upset because they </v>
<v Speaker 2>control the world that I operate in.</v>

965
00:43:29.480 --> 00:43:30.313
<v Speaker 2>They determine my fate in many ways.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I know that just because of the </v>

966
00:43:32.871 --> 00:43:34.100
<v Speaker 2>things that we talk about here every </v>
<v Speaker 2>week,</v>

967
00:43:34.101 --> 00:43:34.934
<v Speaker 2>when you say the word liberal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that a certain amount of my audience is </v>

968
00:43:36.651 --> 00:43:37.401
<v Speaker 2>going to go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wait a minute,</v>

969
00:43:37.401 --> 00:43:38.234
<v Speaker 2>does he mean classical liberal or does </v>
<v Speaker 2>he mean progressive or leftist or </v>

970
00:43:42.200 --> 00:43:43.033
<v Speaker 2>something?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You,</v>

971
00:43:43.040 --> 00:43:45.050
<v Speaker 2>it's obvious to me you're making that </v>
<v Speaker 2>distinction,</v>

972
00:43:45.110 --> 00:43:45.943
<v Speaker 2>but the word liberal has now been so </v>
<v Speaker 2>muddied that in some ways it's not even </v>

973
00:43:49.820 --> 00:43:51.860
<v Speaker 2>worth the progressives who,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who,</v>

974
00:43:51.890 --> 00:43:52.723
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>shut down the nickelodeons and the turn </v>

975
00:43:53.901 --> 00:43:56.750
<v Speaker 2>of the 20th century.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're the ones who changed the meaning</v>

976
00:43:56.751 --> 00:43:57.584
<v Speaker 2>of the word.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They seized it sort of after world war </v>

977
00:43:59.691 --> 00:44:00.351
<v Speaker 2>one and said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh no,</v>

978
00:44:00.351 --> 00:44:01.490
<v Speaker 2>we're liberals.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And people are like,</v>

979
00:44:01.491 --> 00:44:02.710
<v Speaker 2>what are you talking about?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're not liberals.</v>

980
00:44:02.720 --> 00:44:04.980
<v Speaker 2>You want the state to control much of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the economy and,</v>

981
00:44:05.150 --> 00:44:07.310
<v Speaker 2>and much of our lives.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>

982
00:44:07.311 --> 00:44:07.941
<v Speaker 2>but they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

983
00:44:07.941 --> 00:44:10.040
<v Speaker 2>they started to use that word and it </v>
<v Speaker 2>stuck.</v>

984
00:44:10.100 --> 00:44:10.933
<v Speaker 2>And so once the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>once the new deal happens in the 19 </v>

985
00:44:12.501 --> 00:44:14.750
<v Speaker 2>thirties,</v>
<v Speaker 2>franklin roosevelt becomes another jesus</v>

986
00:44:14.751 --> 00:44:15.584
<v Speaker 2>fIgure and he calls himself a liberal </v>
<v Speaker 2>and they people call his movement </v>

987
00:44:18.261 --> 00:44:20.960
<v Speaker 2>liberal then that was it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was the moment,</v>

988
00:44:20.961 --> 00:44:22.820
<v Speaker 2>that turning point.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

989
00:44:22.821 --> 00:44:23.780
<v Speaker 2>this is all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of course,</v>

990
00:44:23.781 --> 00:44:27.590
<v Speaker 2>a repudiation of classical liberalism,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is about the individual,</v>

991
00:44:27.650 --> 00:44:30.560
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>having some autonomy or at least freedom</v>

992
00:44:30.561 --> 00:44:32.670
<v Speaker 2>from the state and its power.</v>

993
00:44:32.760 --> 00:44:37.740
<v Speaker 1>Do you think that people like us can win</v>
<v Speaker 1>that word back?</v>

994
00:44:38.060 --> 00:44:39.320
<v Speaker 1>That's what I've been thinking about </v>
<v Speaker 1>lately,</v>

995
00:44:39.360 --> 00:44:42.810
<v Speaker 1>like I like making this argument for </v>
<v Speaker 1>liberalism versus the left.</v>

996
00:44:42.960 --> 00:44:43.793
<v Speaker 1>I just don't think it's a liberal </v>
<v Speaker 1>movement anymore and I know that I </v>

997
00:44:46.471 --> 00:44:47.304
<v Speaker 1>brought a lot of people to it and have </v>
<v Speaker 1>many allies that are doing similar work </v>

998
00:44:49.790 --> 00:44:51.240
<v Speaker 1>that you included.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

999
00:44:51.960 --> 00:44:52.793
<v Speaker 1>but do you think it's possible,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the word liberal is now so tainted </v>

1000
00:44:55.590 --> 00:44:57.300
<v Speaker 1>that in the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the broader sense,</v>

1001
00:44:57.390 --> 00:44:59.580
<v Speaker 1>maybe we can build something around that</v>
<v Speaker 1>word.</v>

1002
00:44:59.610 --> 00:45:02.370
<v Speaker 1>Not to say the ideas can't be used in </v>
<v Speaker 1>another way.</v>

1003
00:45:02.450 --> 00:45:03.890
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I'm not sure I want to.</v>

1004
00:45:03.950 --> 00:45:07.760
<v Speaker 2>So I'm not a classical liberal and I </v>
<v Speaker 2>don't love classical liberalism.</v>

1005
00:45:07.761 --> 00:45:10.130
<v Speaker 2>I like some of it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the,</v>

1006
00:45:10.190 --> 00:45:15.190
<v Speaker 2>the puritan notion of the repressed </v>
<v Speaker 2>individual who never talks about sex and</v>

1007
00:45:16.031 --> 00:45:18.500
<v Speaker 2>don't only have sex to procreate and he </v>
<v Speaker 2>works all the time.</v>

1008
00:45:19.010 --> 00:45:21.140
<v Speaker 2>That's actually at the center of </v>
<v Speaker 2>classical liberalism.</v>

1009
00:45:21.141 --> 00:45:23.900
<v Speaker 2>So if you read john locke and you read </v>
<v Speaker 2>the founding fathers,</v>

1010
00:45:24.170 --> 00:45:25.003
<v Speaker 2>this is what they say.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We must regulate ourselves so that the </v>

1011
00:45:29.151 --> 00:45:31.850
<v Speaker 2>state doesn't have to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's a,</v>

1012
00:45:31.851 --> 00:45:35.210
<v Speaker 2>it's a cultural puritanism.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's good that they don't want the state</v>

1013
00:45:35.211 --> 00:45:37.370
<v Speaker 2>regulating us in those ways,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I liked that.</v>

1014
00:45:37.371 --> 00:45:41.270
<v Speaker 2>I like the bill of rights,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they say for that to happen,</v>

1015
00:45:41.360 --> 00:45:42.193
<v Speaker 2>for that to be possible,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we must constantly police ourselves so </v>

1016
00:45:46.071 --> 00:45:48.230
<v Speaker 2>the cop becomes internal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The police,</v>

1017
00:45:48.320 --> 00:45:51.080
<v Speaker 2>the policeman is inside of us,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I don't love that.</v>

1018
00:45:51.110 --> 00:45:51.943
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1019
00:45:51.960 --> 00:45:52.793
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's interesting because I've never </v>

1020
00:45:53.161 --> 00:45:55.680
<v Speaker 1>thought of it in that I know exactly </v>
<v Speaker 1>what you're talking about,</v>

1021
00:45:55.681 --> 00:45:56.514
<v Speaker 1>but to me that was more of just a sign </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the times then versus now because </v>

1022
00:45:59.821 --> 00:46:02.490
<v Speaker 1>aren't we all policing ourselves in our </v>
<v Speaker 1>own way?</v>

1023
00:46:02.491 --> 00:46:06.180
<v Speaker 1>I mean every day you get up and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't do everything that every whim that</v>

1024
00:46:06.181 --> 00:46:08.340
<v Speaker 1>you want to do and every crazy urge that</v>
<v Speaker 1>you want to do.</v>

1025
00:46:08.460 --> 00:46:11.010
<v Speaker 1>So we're all sort of doIng that just by </v>
<v Speaker 1>living,</v>

1026
00:46:11.011 --> 00:46:11.300
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1027
00:46:11.300 --> 00:46:12.133
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sure.</v>

1028
00:46:12.190 --> 00:46:14.270
<v Speaker 2>It's not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's not.</v>

1029
00:46:14.300 --> 00:46:16.850
<v Speaker 2>It wasn't a sign of the times that they </v>
<v Speaker 2>made this argument.</v>

1030
00:46:16.851 --> 00:46:17.684
<v Speaker 2>I mean lock and the founding fathers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the whole first chapter of my book </v>

1031
00:46:19.790 --> 00:46:20.623
<v Speaker 2>renegade histories on this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean if you think about it's </v>

1032
00:46:22.461 --> 00:46:23.241
<v Speaker 2>consistent,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1033
00:46:23.241 --> 00:46:25.820
<v Speaker 2>They wanted the people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or at least some of the people,</v>

1034
00:46:25.850 --> 00:46:27.650
<v Speaker 2>many of the people to control the </v>
<v Speaker 2>country,</v>

1035
00:46:28.040 --> 00:46:30.170
<v Speaker 2>take it away from the king and run it </v>
<v Speaker 2>themselves,</v>

1036
00:46:30.171 --> 00:46:31.004
<v Speaker 2>and they understood this thing that the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that the leninist understood a century </v>

1037
00:46:34.040 --> 00:46:35.210
<v Speaker 2>later,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is that,</v>

1038
00:46:35.270 --> 00:46:35.961
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to do that,</v>

1039
00:46:35.961 --> 00:46:37.940
<v Speaker 2>jesus,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we've got to like learn a bunch of stuff</v>

1040
00:46:37.941 --> 00:46:39.240
<v Speaker 2>and we've got to stop,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1041
00:46:39.290 --> 00:46:41.540
<v Speaker 2>going to the cockfights and stopped </v>
<v Speaker 2>smoking cigars.</v>

1042
00:46:41.541 --> 00:46:43.580
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>really stopped drinking most of all.</v>

1043
00:46:44.150 --> 00:46:47.480
<v Speaker 2>And because we got to work to do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we've got to run this country.</v>

1044
00:46:47.510 --> 00:46:50.600
<v Speaker 2>Democracy I say is puritanical for that </v>
<v Speaker 2>reason.</v>

1045
00:46:51.480 --> 00:46:55.650
<v Speaker 1>So it's interesting because as you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you say you work with learn liberty,</v>

1046
00:46:55.651 --> 00:46:58.500
<v Speaker 1>their classical liberal organization.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They sent you to me.</v>

1047
00:46:58.501 --> 00:46:59.334
<v Speaker 1>I just want to make up nobody.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to make a point of sayIng that's </v>

1048
00:47:01.501 --> 00:47:02.334
<v Speaker 1>why it's a beautiful thing that we're </v>
<v Speaker 1>doing with them because you just said I </v>

1049
00:47:04.551 --> 00:47:06.900
<v Speaker 1>am not a classical liberal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>were where do you.</v>

1050
00:47:07.020 --> 00:47:07.853
<v Speaker 1>If you had to give yourself a label,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I kNow you don't want to get hung up on </v>

1051
00:47:09.901 --> 00:47:10.734
<v Speaker 1>that kind of stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I sense A lot of classical liberal </v>

1052
00:47:12.061 --> 00:47:14.070
<v Speaker 1>stuff from you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I send some libertarian stuff from you.</v>

1053
00:47:14.190 --> 00:47:17.340
<v Speaker 1>I sent some utility of the state from </v>
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>

1054
00:47:17.880 --> 00:47:19.230
<v Speaker 1>What the hell is that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

1055
00:47:19.260 --> 00:47:20.100
<v Speaker 1>Let's make up a new word.</v>

1056
00:47:20.170 --> 00:47:21.220
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1057
00:47:21.230 --> 00:47:22.330
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

1058
00:47:22.331 --> 00:47:24.460
<v Speaker 2>I am.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have sort of,</v>

1059
00:47:24.461 --> 00:47:27.190
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>culturally I guess I'm anarchistic.</v>

1060
00:47:27.220 --> 00:47:31.780
<v Speaker 2>I suppose I am.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm anti authority.</v>

1061
00:47:31.840 --> 00:47:35.020
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't mean I want to demolish </v>
<v Speaker 2>authority and remove authority.</v>

1062
00:47:35.021 --> 00:47:35.854
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I like that there are some people in </v>

1063
00:47:37.841 --> 00:47:40.840
<v Speaker 2>this world who want to take charge </v>
<v Speaker 2>because I don't want to do that work.</v>

1064
00:47:41.100 --> 00:47:42.340
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to do that work.</v>

1065
00:47:42.880 --> 00:47:43.780
<v Speaker 2>It's weird,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1066
00:47:43.781 --> 00:47:44.614
<v Speaker 2>That there are some people who just want</v>
<v Speaker 2>to manage everything and like take </v>

1067
00:47:46.360 --> 00:47:47.193
<v Speaker 2>control and take care of everything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to determine who picks up </v>

1068
00:47:49.541 --> 00:47:51.250
<v Speaker 2>your garbage on monday morning.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1069
00:47:51.251 --> 00:47:53.260
<v Speaker 2>That's fine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm glad you want to do that.</v>

1070
00:47:53.770 --> 00:47:55.780
<v Speaker 2>I'd rather play video games or whatever </v>
<v Speaker 2>it is.</v>

1071
00:47:55.781 --> 00:47:57.700
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so I don't know what that is.</v>

1072
00:47:57.701 --> 00:47:58.660
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1073
00:47:59.170 --> 00:48:01.390
<v Speaker 2>that's why I like a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 2>libertarianism,</v>

1074
00:48:01.420 --> 00:48:02.253
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>obviously because they want the state </v>

1075
00:48:03.251 --> 00:48:04.120
<v Speaker 2>out of our lives.</v>

1076
00:48:04.390 --> 00:48:05.223
<v Speaker 2>But a lot of libertarians have this </v>
<v Speaker 2>classical idea of the self regulating </v>

1077
00:48:08.231 --> 00:48:10.360
<v Speaker 2>individual.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're right in the middle of it.</v>

1078
00:48:10.361 --> 00:48:13.690
<v Speaker 2>And so I don't like that at all because </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're kind of not fun either.</v>

1079
00:48:13.860 --> 00:48:14.693
<v Speaker 2>They were actually.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A lot of libertarians remind me of the </v>

1080
00:48:16.061 --> 00:48:16.894
<v Speaker 2>socialists that I grew up with.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're very stodgy and very kind of </v>

1081
00:48:20.380 --> 00:48:21.213
<v Speaker 2>uptight and controlled and not </v>
<v Speaker 2>interested in the real world and the </v>

1082
00:48:24.251 --> 00:48:25.084
<v Speaker 2>pleasures and the real world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All the pleasure they get is from </v>

1083
00:48:27.521 --> 00:48:29.710
<v Speaker 2>reading books,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whIch I understand,</v>

1084
00:48:29.740 --> 00:48:31.840
<v Speaker 2>but there's more to life than that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1085
00:48:31.900 --> 00:48:35.320
<v Speaker 2>this past week was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or about a week ago is vidcon,</v>

1086
00:48:35.321 --> 00:48:37.420
<v Speaker 2>which is where all these youtubers get </v>
<v Speaker 2>together.</v>

1087
00:48:37.421 --> 00:48:39.490
<v Speaker 2>I didn't go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but a lot of the people that are sort of</v>

1088
00:48:39.491 --> 00:48:40.324
<v Speaker 2>in my youtube circles,</v>
<v Speaker 2>most of them are younger than me were </v>

1089
00:48:42.941 --> 00:48:43.774
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it seemed like what I could gather </v>

1090
00:48:45.191 --> 00:48:46.024
<v Speaker 2>was they were the fun group that there's</v>
<v Speaker 2>these people on the left that are </v>

1091
00:48:48.431 --> 00:48:51.010
<v Speaker 2>screaming about the third wave feminism </v>
<v Speaker 2>and all this stuff,</v>

1092
00:48:51.190 --> 00:48:52.810
<v Speaker 2>and then they're at a youtube </v>
<v Speaker 2>conference.</v>

1093
00:48:52.810 --> 00:48:55.150
<v Speaker 2>It's not a lot of many people on the </v>
<v Speaker 2>traditional right,</v>

1094
00:48:55.360 --> 00:48:56.193
<v Speaker 2>but that this new group,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever this thing is of these sorta </v>

1095
00:48:58.840 --> 00:49:01.240
<v Speaker 2>half liberal libertarian mix,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever,</v>

1096
00:49:01.470 --> 00:49:04.120
<v Speaker 2>that they're the fun group and that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>what's attracting people.</v>

1097
00:49:04.180 --> 00:49:07.180
<v Speaker 2>I think that was probably a lot of what </v>
<v Speaker 2>was in the middle of gamer gate,</v>

1098
00:49:07.240 --> 00:49:08.073
<v Speaker 2>which was that there's these kids </v>
<v Speaker 2>playing video games who like looking at </v>

1099
00:49:12.670 --> 00:49:15.940
<v Speaker 2>women with big boobs and happy and </v>
<v Speaker 2>enjoying it.</v>

1100
00:49:16.150 --> 00:49:17.440
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that was about it.</v>

1101
00:49:17.441 --> 00:49:19.150
<v Speaker 2>I think for most of them I would </v>
<v Speaker 2>imagine.</v>

1102
00:49:19.151 --> 00:49:21.130
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They like shooting people,</v>

1103
00:49:21.220 --> 00:49:22.380
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Virtually,</v>

1104
00:49:22.990 --> 00:49:24.820
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and watching the heads explode,</v>

1105
00:49:24.821 --> 00:49:26.140
<v Speaker 2>which you're not allowed to do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>By the way,</v>

1106
00:49:26.141 --> 00:49:26.974
<v Speaker 2>that's another form of oppression that </v>
<v Speaker 2>the puritans and the victorians </v>

1107
00:49:29.710 --> 00:49:30.543
<v Speaker 2>instituted.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We can't fight each other in the </v>

1108
00:49:32.291 --> 00:49:34.510
<v Speaker 2>streets.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's an archaic and disorderly.</v>

1109
00:49:34.570 --> 00:49:36.940
<v Speaker 2>We have to let the state do all the </v>
<v Speaker 2>killing for us.</v>

1110
00:49:36.940 --> 00:49:38.470
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>We get the monopoly on violence,</v>

1111
00:49:38.471 --> 00:49:40.030
<v Speaker 2>the state does,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so you can't do that anymore.</v>

1112
00:49:40.031 --> 00:49:42.580
<v Speaker 2>So lIke boxing was shunned for a long </v>
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>

1113
00:49:43.090 --> 00:49:44.060
<v Speaker 2>All these things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>

1114
00:49:44.080 --> 00:49:46.290
<v Speaker 2>And so I think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think video games represent sort of a,</v>

1115
00:49:46.360 --> 00:49:47.193
<v Speaker 2>a return of the repressed to use freud's</v>
<v Speaker 2>term in that way because these kids are </v>

1116
00:49:51.281 --> 00:49:52.114
<v Speaker 2>doing stuff you're not allowed to do and</v>
<v Speaker 2>through these video games which is kill </v>

1117
00:49:54.910 --> 00:49:57.130
<v Speaker 2>and have sex or at least some kind of </v>
<v Speaker 2>sex,</v>

1118
00:49:57.380 --> 00:50:00.040
<v Speaker 2>sexual in that way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's fun.</v>

1119
00:50:00.070 --> 00:50:04.570
<v Speaker 2>NoW we know that this didn't cause them </v>
<v Speaker 2>to go out and shoot people.</v>

1120
00:50:04.571 --> 00:50:07.480
<v Speaker 2>We know that it didn't cause them to go </v>
<v Speaker 2>out and rape people.</v>

1121
00:50:07.510 --> 00:50:08.650
<v Speaker 2>We know this from many,</v>
<v Speaker 2>many,</v>

1122
00:50:08.651 --> 00:50:10.960
<v Speaker 2>many studies with grace.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Every study,</v>

1123
00:50:11.320 --> 00:50:12.180
<v Speaker 2>every study,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

1124
00:50:12.190 --> 00:50:13.630
<v Speaker 2>So we just know that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1125
00:50:14.050 --> 00:50:14.883
<v Speaker 2>and so they were having fun doing this </v>
<v Speaker 2>stuff that you're not allowed to do or </v>

1126
00:50:18.551 --> 00:50:19.660
<v Speaker 2>even express.</v>

1127
00:50:19.690 --> 00:50:23.260
<v Speaker 2>You're not even allowed to express those</v>
<v Speaker 2>desires in this culture.</v>

1128
00:50:23.261 --> 00:50:24.094
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then all of a sudden you have these </v>

1129
00:50:24.971 --> 00:50:25.804
<v Speaker 2>people coming in and swooping in and </v>
<v Speaker 2>telling them that not only what they're </v>

1130
00:50:29.330 --> 00:50:31.310
<v Speaker 2>doing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just their thoughts,</v>

1131
00:50:31.311 --> 00:50:32.144
<v Speaker 2>their feelings are bad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But that it's going to cause another </v>

1132
00:50:34.431 --> 00:50:37.570
<v Speaker 2>sandy hook and another mass rape </v>
<v Speaker 2>somewhere and that it's,</v>

1133
00:50:37.680 --> 00:50:40.050
<v Speaker 2>it's the cause of the subjugation of </v>
<v Speaker 2>women will.</v>

1134
00:50:40.550 --> 00:50:42.600
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't make sense to these kids.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I'm,</v>

1135
00:50:42.650 --> 00:50:45.290
<v Speaker 2>I imagine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's like we were just having fun in</v>

1136
00:50:45.291 --> 00:50:47.070
<v Speaker 2>our mom's basement.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We,</v>

1137
00:50:47.080 --> 00:50:49.940
<v Speaker 2>by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we have zero institutional power in this</v>

1138
00:50:49.941 --> 00:50:50.900
<v Speaker 2>country.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nothing,</v>

1139
00:50:50.930 --> 00:50:53.840
<v Speaker 2>nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you're telling us suddenly we're the</v>

1140
00:50:53.841 --> 00:50:55.700
<v Speaker 2>most powerful people in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>

1141
00:50:55.701 --> 00:50:57.300
<v Speaker 2>by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm speaking for them now.</v>

1142
00:50:59.090 --> 00:50:59.923
<v Speaker 2>Here's what's so amazing to me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like you've got a game or get hat </v>

1143
00:51:01.431 --> 00:51:03.740
<v Speaker 2>for where you are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Here's what's so amazing to me.</v>

1144
00:51:03.740 --> 00:51:06.790
<v Speaker 2>It's like why are feminists or went or </v>
<v Speaker 2>any.</v>

1145
00:51:06.920 --> 00:51:10.970
<v Speaker 2>Why is everyone so concerned about what </v>
<v Speaker 2>those people think?</v>

1146
00:51:11.270 --> 00:51:12.103
<v Speaker 2>Like that's what it becomes important in</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of feminist discourse is what we </v>

1147
00:51:15.801 --> 00:51:17.630
<v Speaker 2>think.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What men think.</v>

1148
00:51:18.140 --> 00:51:21.710
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that all that does is sort of reinscribe</v>

1149
00:51:21.711 --> 00:51:22.970
<v Speaker 2>the patriarchy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1150
00:51:23.120 --> 00:51:27.290
<v Speaker 2>What we think what we do is what's </v>
<v Speaker 2>important but men do and think is what's</v>

1151
00:51:27.291 --> 00:51:28.100
<v Speaker 2>important.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1152
00:51:28.100 --> 00:51:31.430
<v Speaker 2>how about just saY I'm going to do what </v>
<v Speaker 2>I want to do and many feminists,</v>

1153
00:51:31.431 --> 00:51:32.840
<v Speaker 2>by the way have done this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a,</v>

1154
00:51:32.870 --> 00:51:33.703
<v Speaker 2>there's a different strain of feminism </v>
<v Speaker 2>that I love which has been called sex </v>

1155
00:51:36.591 --> 00:51:38.900
<v Speaker 2>positive feminism or independent </v>
<v Speaker 2>feminism.</v>

1156
00:51:39.100 --> 00:51:39.933
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's sort of more the christina </v>

1157
00:51:40.511 --> 00:51:41.344
<v Speaker 1>hoff summers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know she doesn't focus that much on </v>

1158
00:51:42.521 --> 00:51:43.354
<v Speaker 1>sex,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but she but more just like let them do </v>

1159
00:51:44.801 --> 00:51:45.320
<v Speaker 1>their thing</v>

1160
00:51:45.320 --> 00:51:46.310
<v Speaker 2>maybe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1161
00:51:46.311 --> 00:51:49.670
<v Speaker 2>So I had a guest on my show,</v>
<v Speaker 2>her name is anna aerosmith,</v>

1162
00:51:50.030 --> 00:51:50.863
<v Speaker 2>she's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she was a feminist in and she hated </v>

1163
00:51:54.111 --> 00:51:54.944
<v Speaker 2>pornography.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She thought it degraded Women and then </v>

1164
00:51:57.381 --> 00:51:59.390
<v Speaker 2>she was walking down the street in soho </v>
<v Speaker 2>in london,</v>

1165
00:51:59.391 --> 00:52:00.224
<v Speaker 2>which is the red light district </v>
<v Speaker 2>basically in london thinking and </v>

1166
00:52:02.091 --> 00:52:03.970
<v Speaker 2>watching all these shops full of these,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1167
00:52:04.010 --> 00:52:04.843
<v Speaker 2>video video's sex oliver.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And she was turned on by it and she </v>

1168
00:52:08.961 --> 00:52:10.010
<v Speaker 2>thought,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh wait a minute,</v>

1169
00:52:10.040 --> 00:52:12.440
<v Speaker 2>I'm turned on by this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I don't like that.</v>

1170
00:52:12.441 --> 00:52:14.750
<v Speaker 2>So you know what I'm gonna do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to make my own porn.</v>

1171
00:52:15.080 --> 00:52:16.520
<v Speaker 2>And so she started making your own </v>
<v Speaker 2>parents.</v>

1172
00:52:16.540 --> 00:52:19.220
<v Speaker 2>She became the biggest female </v>
<v Speaker 2>pornography in the world.</v>

1173
00:52:20.030 --> 00:52:23.090
<v Speaker 2>And did it on her own terms and it's all</v>
<v Speaker 2>hardcore.</v>

1174
00:52:23.140 --> 00:52:25.580
<v Speaker 2>There's nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She doesn't hold any held anything back.</v>

1175
00:52:25.581 --> 00:52:28.040
<v Speaker 2>She just makes it nicer looking and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>men are better looking,</v>

1176
00:52:28.041 --> 00:52:30.020
<v Speaker 2>et cetera.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's it.</v>

1177
00:52:30.050 --> 00:52:31.250
<v Speaker 2>To me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's feminism.</v>

1178
00:52:31.340 --> 00:52:32.173
<v Speaker 2>Do it on your own,</v>
<v Speaker 2>make your own world right instead of </v>

1179
00:52:35.150 --> 00:52:37.880
<v Speaker 2>worrying constantly about what I want </v>
<v Speaker 2>and what I think.</v>

1180
00:52:38.120 --> 00:52:38.953
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How unhealthy do you think just having </v>

1181
00:52:41.751 --> 00:52:42.584
<v Speaker 1>to talk about politics all the time is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't mean what we're doing right </v>

1182
00:52:45.291 --> 00:52:45.620
<v Speaker 1>here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1183
00:52:45.620 --> 00:52:49.370
<v Speaker 1>So I don't mean for the people that have</v>
<v Speaker 1>these conversations about ideas in that,</v>

1184
00:52:49.371 --> 00:52:53.000
<v Speaker 1>but I mean for the average person that </v>
<v Speaker 1>all day long now because of social media</v>

1185
00:52:53.450 --> 00:52:54.283
<v Speaker 1>is harping about every little decision </v>
<v Speaker 1>that happens in the government and that </v>

1186
00:52:57.711 --> 00:53:00.050
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's strikes me as it's becoming,</v>

1187
00:53:00.080 --> 00:53:04.090
<v Speaker 1>it's starting to like really rocked </v>
<v Speaker 1>people's minds or something like,</v>

1188
00:53:04.100 --> 00:53:04.933
<v Speaker 1>I would argue that a good government is </v>
<v Speaker 1>one that's small enough that you </v>

1189
00:53:06.771 --> 00:53:08.270
<v Speaker 1>wouldn't have to talk about it all the </v>
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>

1190
00:53:08.510 --> 00:53:09.343
<v Speaker 1>Now this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's probably good counter arguments </v>

1191
00:53:10.701 --> 00:53:11.534
<v Speaker 1>to that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the idea that people are all day </v>

1192
00:53:13.550 --> 00:53:16.850
<v Speaker 1>worried about this seems like a real </v>
<v Speaker 1>problem.</v>

1193
00:53:17.220 --> 00:53:18.660
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so when you say people,</v>

1194
00:53:19.550 --> 00:53:20.383
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1195
00:53:20.580 --> 00:53:22.230
<v Speaker 2>how many people are we talking about?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Again?</v>

1196
00:53:22.231 --> 00:53:23.870
<v Speaker 2>I think it's right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's hard to gauge is the.</v>

1197
00:53:23.910 --> 00:53:25.680
<v Speaker 2>I think it's a lot of people to each </v>
<v Speaker 2>other,</v>

1198
00:53:25.710 --> 00:53:26.543
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's a pretty small world that </v>

1199
00:53:27.661 --> 00:53:29.700
<v Speaker 2>we inhabit or that we observe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1200
00:53:29.730 --> 00:53:31.020
<v Speaker 2>I think the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think most.</v>

1201
00:53:31.021 --> 00:53:31.854
<v Speaker 2>Well what is it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Twenty five percent of americans are on </v>

1202
00:53:33.061 --> 00:53:33.871
<v Speaker 2>twitter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1203
00:53:33.871 --> 00:53:35.610
<v Speaker 2>So that's a quarter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a pretty big chunk.</v>

1204
00:53:35.860 --> 00:53:36.693
<v Speaker 2>But of those,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how many just read what katy perry's </v>

1205
00:53:38.731 --> 00:53:39.361
<v Speaker 2>feed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1206
00:53:39.361 --> 00:53:42.300
<v Speaker 2>I mean I think that those who do </v>
<v Speaker 2>politics</v>

1207
00:53:42.500 --> 00:53:45.410
<v Speaker 1>bar bizarrely political though because </v>
<v Speaker 1>of doing stuff with hillary,</v>

1208
00:53:45.411 --> 00:53:46.120
<v Speaker 1>so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1209
00:53:46.120 --> 00:53:46.440
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1210
00:53:46.440 --> 00:53:47.273
<v Speaker 2>But let's say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know what's called political </v>

1211
00:53:48.211 --> 00:53:49.230
<v Speaker 2>twitter,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>

1212
00:53:49.231 --> 00:53:50.620
<v Speaker 2>but how many people are there?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1213
00:53:51.420 --> 00:53:53.520
<v Speaker 2>And how many people there are just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1214
00:53:53.521 --> 00:53:55.470
<v Speaker 2>just check in on the democratic party's </v>
<v Speaker 2>latest,</v>

1215
00:53:55.510 --> 00:53:57.570
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>announcements,</v>

1216
00:53:57.571 --> 00:53:59.490
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's a pretty small world.</v>

1217
00:53:59.491 --> 00:54:02.100
<v Speaker 2>I'm not too worried about the population</v>
<v Speaker 2>in general.</v>

1218
00:54:02.130 --> 00:54:02.963
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I do think that the world that you </v>

1219
00:54:04.261 --> 00:54:08.700
<v Speaker 2>and I have chosen to live in is pretty </v>
<v Speaker 2>uncomfortable.</v>

1220
00:54:08.940 --> 00:54:11.040
<v Speaker 2>And I'd say since the election in </v>
<v Speaker 2>particular,</v>

1221
00:54:11.041 --> 00:54:11.874
<v Speaker 2>it's nearly intolerable,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I used to be a twitter addict and </v>

1222
00:54:15.121 --> 00:54:17.460
<v Speaker 2>then since the election it's actually </v>
<v Speaker 2>been really hard.</v>

1223
00:54:17.490 --> 00:54:20.760
<v Speaker 2>It's not been fun to go on twitter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It really almost never is funded.</v>

1224
00:54:20.800 --> 00:54:25.200
<v Speaker 2>Almost always makes me sad or angry.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so I watch it less,</v>

1225
00:54:25.230 --> 00:54:27.270
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I don't know,</v>

1226
00:54:27.330 --> 00:54:28.163
<v Speaker 2>I think that may be the next phase we're</v>
<v Speaker 2>going to go through the twitter will </v>

1227
00:54:30.211 --> 00:54:32.820
<v Speaker 2>become something else or there will be </v>
<v Speaker 2>alternatives to it and you know,</v>

1228
00:54:32.821 --> 00:54:33.654
<v Speaker 2>it's just people talking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The thing is to just keep going and not </v>

1229
00:54:37.890 --> 00:54:38.160
<v Speaker 2>a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

1230
00:54:38.160 --> 00:54:38.993
<v Speaker 2>it's hard,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but to not let the eggs with the five </v>

1231
00:54:41.401 --> 00:54:43.080
<v Speaker 2>followers get to you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they get to me,</v>

1232
00:54:44.010 --> 00:54:46.710
<v Speaker 2>but we just have to keep going if we </v>
<v Speaker 2>want to do this.</v>

1233
00:54:47.730 --> 00:54:48.563
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1234
00:54:49.220 --> 00:54:52.340
<v Speaker 1>what about the amount of time that we're</v>
<v Speaker 1>spending on this?</v>

1235
00:54:52.341 --> 00:54:54.260
<v Speaker 1>That I think that's really what I meant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're not just,</v>

1236
00:54:54.380 --> 00:54:55.213
<v Speaker 1>not just the griping but the amount of </v>
<v Speaker 1>time people are worried about these </v>

1237
00:54:57.861 --> 00:54:59.720
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>LIke the broader people.</v>

1238
00:54:59.870 --> 00:55:00.620
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1239
00:55:00.620 --> 00:55:02.230
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the thing that I don't like is there,</v>

1240
00:55:02.550 --> 00:55:05.280
<v Speaker 2>the policing that goes on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a constant policing,</v>

1241
00:55:05.310 --> 00:55:06.143
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You said this and you shouldn't say </v>

1242
00:55:07.591 --> 00:55:08.700
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You shouldn't think this,</v>

1243
00:55:08.701 --> 00:55:11.400
<v Speaker 2>you shouldn't feel this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You need to check yourself.</v>

1244
00:55:11.401 --> 00:55:13.650
<v Speaker 2>You need to watch yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's all,</v>

1245
00:55:13.651 --> 00:55:15.670
<v Speaker 2>it's a totalitarian language.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1246
00:55:15.840 --> 00:55:17.340
<v Speaker 2>which again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>by the way it comes out of the frankfurt</v>

1247
00:55:17.341 --> 00:55:18.960
<v Speaker 2>school.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It does,</v>

1248
00:55:19.620 --> 00:55:20.453
<v Speaker 2>which their argument was that language </v>
<v Speaker 2>is this tool of the oppressor against </v>

1249
00:55:23.581 --> 00:55:25.110
<v Speaker 2>the oppressed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so we need to,</v>

1250
00:55:25.170 --> 00:55:26.003
<v Speaker 2>we need to recapture the language and </v>
<v Speaker 2>make it our own to bring about </v>

1251
00:55:29.161 --> 00:55:30.930
<v Speaker 2>revolution.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was the frankfurt school.</v>

1252
00:55:31.380 --> 00:55:32.770
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

1253
00:55:32.850 --> 00:55:36.690
<v Speaker 2>it's a totalitarian impulse.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a totalitarian politics.</v>

1254
00:55:38.320 --> 00:55:41.520
<v Speaker 2>It's no fun to be around.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think that's the thing.</v>

1255
00:55:42.240 --> 00:55:43.073
<v Speaker 2>People are just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're repudiating it sort of tacitly </v>

1256
00:55:45.840 --> 00:55:48.060
<v Speaker 2>in that they are there watching their </v>
<v Speaker 2>video.</v>

1257
00:55:48.061 --> 00:55:48.894
<v Speaker 2>They're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're playing video games instead </v>

1258
00:55:49.501 --> 00:55:52.700
<v Speaker 2>they're watching television instead.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're not engaging in this discourse.</v>

1259
00:55:52.720 --> 00:55:54.660
<v Speaker 2>You and I are masochists because we do </v>
<v Speaker 2>It.</v>

1260
00:55:55.320 --> 00:55:57.060
<v Speaker 2>Most people are not masochists in that </v>
<v Speaker 2>way.</v>

1261
00:55:57.061 --> 00:55:59.040
<v Speaker 2>So that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to me the cause for hope.</v>

1262
00:55:59.170 --> 00:56:02.260
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's so funny because I enjoy 90 percent</v>

1263
00:56:02.261 --> 00:56:05.890
<v Speaker 1>of this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There is that 10 percent of just,</v>

1264
00:56:05.920 --> 00:56:06.753
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when people are malicious lead </v>

1265
00:56:08.051 --> 00:56:11.020
<v Speaker 1>misquoting me or writing things that are</v>
<v Speaker 1>blatantly not true,</v>

1266
00:56:11.230 --> 00:56:14.150
<v Speaker 1>the rest of the interaction,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can basically deal with it.</v>

1267
00:56:14.151 --> 00:56:16.930
<v Speaker 1>I do love the battle of ideas,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but believe me,</v>

1268
00:56:16.931 --> 00:56:18.090
<v Speaker 1>I hear you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's,</v>

1269
00:56:18.270 --> 00:56:19.103
<v Speaker 1>there's like an unspoken thing that we </v>
<v Speaker 1>can do here that I can't quite quantify </v>

1270
00:56:22.061 --> 00:56:23.440
<v Speaker 1>in words.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So curious.</v>

1271
00:56:23.441 --> 00:56:26.590
<v Speaker 1>So all this being said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have an interesting mix,</v>

1272
00:56:26.650 --> 00:56:27.483
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a mixed match of politics and culture </v>

1273
00:56:30.401 --> 00:56:31.234
<v Speaker 1>and all that stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is there anyone in politics right now </v>

1274
00:56:33.221 --> 00:56:34.360
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you like,</v>

1275
00:56:34.361 --> 00:56:35.040
<v Speaker 1>that you go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

1276
00:56:35.040 --> 00:56:36.490
<v Speaker 1>this guy kinda gets it.</v>

1277
00:56:37.010 --> 00:56:39.310
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Electoral politics.</v>

1278
00:56:39.340 --> 00:56:40.570
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>just anyone right now.</v>

1279
00:56:41.380 --> 00:56:44.680
<v Speaker 1>Who in the public space in general,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like is there like a couple?</v>

1280
00:56:44.681 --> 00:56:45.690
<v Speaker 1>Is there anyone</v>

1281
00:56:45.880 --> 00:56:47.410
<v Speaker 2>in electoral politics?</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's no one.</v>

1282
00:56:47.640 --> 00:56:48.160
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in fact,</v>

1283
00:56:48.160 --> 00:56:48.993
<v Speaker 2>I thought trump was interesting in these</v>
<v Speaker 2>ways that he was at least raising these </v>

1284
00:56:51.851 --> 00:56:53.980
<v Speaker 2>questions for the first time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1285
00:56:53.981 --> 00:56:56.620
<v Speaker 2>I can't stand most of what he's for in </v>
<v Speaker 2>terms of policy,</v>

1286
00:56:56.621 --> 00:56:58.990
<v Speaker 2>but he was raising these questions for </v>
<v Speaker 2>the first time,</v>

1287
00:56:58.991 --> 00:57:00.670
<v Speaker 2>so I got to talk about them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was great.</v>

1288
00:57:00.671 --> 00:57:01.504
<v Speaker 2>Thank you for the opportunity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now leave office and just please don't </v>

1289
00:57:04.301 --> 00:57:06.100
<v Speaker 2>do anything when you're an office is the</v>
<v Speaker 2>Best thing.</v>

1290
00:57:06.101 --> 00:57:06.934
<v Speaker 2>But no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in electoral politics there's no one </v>

1291
00:57:08.891 --> 00:57:09.724
<v Speaker 2>because they are part of the machine or </v>
<v Speaker 2>at least they want to be part of the </v>

1292
00:57:12.131 --> 00:57:12.964
<v Speaker 2>machine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So being part of the machine means </v>

1293
00:57:14.171 --> 00:57:16.720
<v Speaker 2>making yourself a cog right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uninteresting,</v>

1294
00:57:18.520 --> 00:57:20.450
<v Speaker 2>uninteresting to me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1295
00:57:21.180 --> 00:57:23.560
<v Speaker 2>there are very few cultural radicals </v>
<v Speaker 2>left.</v>

1296
00:57:23.561 --> 00:57:26.170
<v Speaker 2>There are a few sort of sex radicals.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's like three,</v>

1297
00:57:26.320 --> 00:57:27.610
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I find them interesting,</v>

1298
00:57:27.640 --> 00:57:28.510
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people who say,</v>

1299
00:57:28.511 --> 00:57:30.640
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we should talk about sex.</v>

1300
00:57:30.641 --> 00:57:33.250
<v Speaker 2>We should be able to express our desires</v>
<v Speaker 2>openly.</v>

1301
00:57:33.300 --> 00:57:34.450
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's better.</v>

1302
00:57:34.480 --> 00:57:37.220
<v Speaker 2>Sex is a good thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sex is noT about a,</v>

1303
00:57:37.660 --> 00:57:40.480
<v Speaker 2>they almost don't exist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The sixties had that,</v>

1304
00:57:40.570 --> 00:57:41.403
<v Speaker 2>the new left and the counterculture had </v>
<v Speaker 2>some people there who were quite </v>

1305
00:57:43.631 --> 00:57:46.720
<v Speaker 2>interesting in that way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they're gone and it's very sad.</v>

1306
00:57:46.870 --> 00:57:47.710
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's inteResting.</v>

1307
00:57:47.711 --> 00:57:50.410
<v Speaker 1>There's this writer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I forget what he writes for even,</v>

1308
00:57:50.411 --> 00:57:51.244
<v Speaker 1>but I don't know if you saw this thing </v>
<v Speaker 1>where he took a screen capture of his </v>

1309
00:57:52.681 --> 00:57:55.990
<v Speaker 1>screen and one of these tabs had hentai </v>
<v Speaker 1>porn on it,</v>

1310
00:57:55.991 --> 00:57:57.850
<v Speaker 1>which I guess is like octopus </v>
<v Speaker 1>foreigners,</v>

1311
00:57:57.851 --> 00:58:00.490
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some like some cartoon porn at,</v>

1312
00:58:00.560 --> 00:58:03.490
<v Speaker 1>but he's a lefty,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so all these people on this.</v>

1313
00:58:03.491 --> 00:58:04.360
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1314
00:58:04.361 --> 00:58:06.700
<v Speaker 1>these,</v>
<v Speaker 1>anything goes over here.</v>

1315
00:58:06.820 --> 00:58:08.620
<v Speaker 1>They were all attacking him and I was </v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

1316
00:58:08.730 --> 00:58:11.440
<v Speaker 1>do you guys not see the irony in what </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're doing here?</v>

1317
00:58:11.441 --> 00:58:14.050
<v Speaker 1>like it wasn't illegal what he was </v>
<v Speaker 1>doing.</v>

1318
00:58:14.051 --> 00:58:15.850
<v Speaker 1>It was some odd thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1319
00:58:16.150 --> 00:58:18.660
<v Speaker 1>but I though you guys are the free </v>
<v Speaker 1>being,</v>

1320
00:58:18.670 --> 00:58:19.670
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All righty.</v>

1321
00:58:19.770 --> 00:58:20.603
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of the left I would imagine It </v>

1322
00:58:21.810 --> 00:58:23.910
<v Speaker 2>would attack him too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean they have in the past,</v>

1323
00:58:23.911 --> 00:58:24.510
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because that's,</v>

1324
00:58:24.510 --> 00:58:26.100
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the objectification of women.</v>

1325
00:58:26.101 --> 00:58:28.200
<v Speaker 2>So we can't have that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1326
00:58:28.650 --> 00:58:29.161
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

1327
00:58:29.161 --> 00:58:29.631
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

1328
00:58:29.631 --> 00:58:31.280
<v Speaker 2>it's not fun.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1329
00:58:31.380 --> 00:58:33.030
<v Speaker 2>but.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So in terms of.</v>

1330
00:58:34.730 --> 00:58:35.040
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

1331
00:58:35.040 --> 00:58:35.873
<v Speaker 2>I guess I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess it's sort of my mission to kind </v>

1332
00:58:37.141 --> 00:58:39.300
<v Speaker 2>of bring back that kind of.</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it is left wing.</v>

1333
00:58:39.301 --> 00:58:40.620
<v Speaker 2>here's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here's part of my politics too,</v>

1334
00:58:40.621 --> 00:58:41.454
<v Speaker 2>it's like that sort of left cultural </v>
<v Speaker 2>radicalism back into political </v>

1335
00:58:45.811 --> 00:58:48.240
<v Speaker 2>discourse,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is just doesn't exist really.</v>

1336
00:58:48.340 --> 00:58:51.100
<v Speaker 1>So when you say left cultural radical </v>
<v Speaker 1>radicalism,</v>

1337
00:58:51.101 --> 00:58:51.934
<v Speaker 1>you meet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you actually do mean freedom In that </v>

1338
00:58:54.251 --> 00:58:55.084
<v Speaker 1>context.</v>
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't sound like something that's </v>

1339
00:58:56.111 --> 00:58:57.820
<v Speaker 1>of the modern left now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's what you're.</v>

1340
00:58:58.120 --> 00:59:01.120
<v Speaker 1>You're talkIng about real great art or </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're talking about great comedy,</v>

1341
00:59:01.330 --> 00:59:02.140
<v Speaker 1>all of those things.</v>

1342
00:59:02.140 --> 00:59:02.973
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm talking about lenny bruce and </v>

1343
00:59:04.361 --> 00:59:06.770
<v Speaker 2>richard pryor.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You talked about standup comics.</v>

1344
00:59:06.930 --> 00:59:09.010
<v Speaker 2>Those are my heroes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Those are my original heroes.</v>

1345
00:59:09.011 --> 00:59:12.820
<v Speaker 2>Richard pryor is my original hero </v>
<v Speaker 2>because he did that.</v>

1346
00:59:12.821 --> 00:59:14.050
<v Speaker 2>He just said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he said,</v>

1347
00:59:14.051 --> 00:59:14.890
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're not supposed to say.</v>

1348
00:59:15.430 --> 00:59:16.780
<v Speaker 2>He said what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're not supposed to say.</v>

1349
00:59:16.781 --> 00:59:17.614
<v Speaker 2>That's what great comedy is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what makes us laugh and that's </v>

1350
00:59:20.111 --> 00:59:21.880
<v Speaker 2>what makes them so brilliant.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>

1351
00:59:22.190 --> 00:59:24.770
<v Speaker 2>And yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if that's lost,</v>

1352
00:59:24.890 --> 00:59:27.160
<v Speaker 2>but it's certainly being challenged.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

1353
00:59:27.170 --> 00:59:29.090
<v Speaker 2>It's being.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just being squeezed.</v>

1354
00:59:29.091 --> 00:59:32.300
<v Speaker 2>Lenny bruce went to prison for that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

1355
00:59:32.301 --> 00:59:33.134
<v Speaker 2>and so do we want to return to that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do we want to put comedians in jail for </v>

1356
00:59:37.011 --> 00:59:38.750
<v Speaker 2>saying things you're not supposed to </v>
<v Speaker 2>say?</v>

1357
00:59:39.170 --> 00:59:42.490
<v Speaker 2>Not doing things you're not supposed to </v>
<v Speaker 2>do,</v>

1358
00:59:42.620 --> 00:59:44.780
<v Speaker 2>sayIng things you're not supposed to </v>
<v Speaker 2>think.</v>

1359
00:59:44.960 --> 00:59:48.530
<v Speaker 2>Giving voice to the taboo,</v>
<v Speaker 2>giving voice to the forbidden.</v>

1360
00:59:48.710 --> 00:59:49.760
<v Speaker 2>That's what they do.</v>

1361
00:59:50.030 --> 00:59:50.863
<v Speaker 2>Shouldn't we have that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Imagine what would be happening if </v>

1362
00:59:53.151 --> 00:59:55.280
<v Speaker 2>george carlin who would be 80 years old </v>
<v Speaker 2>right now,</v>

1363
00:59:55.281 --> 00:59:57.200
<v Speaker 2>we still trying to go to college </v>
<v Speaker 2>campuses.</v>

1364
00:59:57.530 --> 01:00:02.150
<v Speaker 2>They'd be screaming about this old white</v>
<v Speaker 2>man who's saying all of these things.</v>

1365
01:00:02.151 --> 01:00:04.670
<v Speaker 2>This is a massive problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's why,</v>

1366
01:00:04.671 --> 01:00:08.350
<v Speaker 2>by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was so dispirited,</v>

1367
01:00:08.510 --> 01:00:13.510
<v Speaker 2>I guess by bill maher's apology because </v>
<v Speaker 2>everyone knows he's not racist,</v>

1368
01:00:14.090 --> 01:00:14.923
<v Speaker 2>so I'm not saying that I'm going to sit </v>
<v Speaker 2>here and want to use that word if it </v>

1369
01:00:17.361 --> 01:00:20.330
<v Speaker 2>bothers people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Of course speech has consequences.</v>

1370
01:00:20.331 --> 01:00:24.100
<v Speaker 2>I understand that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the apology struck me as man,</v>

1371
01:00:24.590 --> 01:00:27.380
<v Speaker 2>a comedian who's been the hero of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>left,</v>

1372
01:00:27.381 --> 01:00:31.250
<v Speaker 2>has to now bow to them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This strikes me as a major problem.</v>

1373
01:00:31.340 --> 01:00:32.990
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you ready to get into more trouble dive?</v>

1374
01:00:33.020 --> 01:00:33.761
<v Speaker 2>Let's go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

1375
01:00:33.761 --> 01:00:38.420
<v Speaker 2>so nigger is arguably the most important</v>
<v Speaker 2>word in american history.</v>

1376
01:00:38.990 --> 01:00:42.260
<v Speaker 2>If we don't use that word,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're not serious about understanding.</v>

1377
01:00:42.260 --> 01:00:45.410
<v Speaker 2>American history were not serious,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but understandIng that this culture,</v>

1378
01:00:45.740 --> 01:00:48.920
<v Speaker 2>you can be an antiracist or a racist or </v>
<v Speaker 2>anything,</v>

1379
01:00:48.950 --> 01:00:49.783
<v Speaker 2>but if you don't talk about that word </v>
<v Speaker 2>and he used that word the way it's been </v>

1380
01:00:52.461 --> 01:00:55.040
<v Speaker 2>used in history,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not to hurt people,</v>

1381
01:00:55.460 --> 01:00:58.880
<v Speaker 2>not as an epithet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but to simply refer to it.</v>

1382
01:00:58.970 --> 01:01:00.260
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>We can't do that.</v>

1383
01:01:00.380 --> 01:01:03.710
<v Speaker 2>We're not grownups here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're not being serious about ideas,</v>

1384
01:01:03.711 --> 01:01:05.090
<v Speaker 2>about history,</v>
<v Speaker 2>about our culture,</v>

1385
01:01:05.091 --> 01:01:07.340
<v Speaker 2>about America.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We can't understand it,</v>

1386
01:01:07.460 --> 01:01:08.293
<v Speaker 2>and that's really what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's avoiding these ideas rather than </v>

1387
01:01:11.120 --> 01:01:11.953
<v Speaker 2>hitting them head on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People talk about slavery as if they </v>

1388
01:01:14.481 --> 01:01:16.760
<v Speaker 2>know anything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They don't know anything about slavery.</v>

1389
01:01:16.761 --> 01:01:17.594
<v Speaker 2>They just know that it was wrong and </v>
<v Speaker 2>there was whipping his all day long and </v>

1390
01:01:19.791 --> 01:01:20.624
<v Speaker 2>it was nothing but rape and torture.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Having never read a thing about the </v>

1391
01:01:23.661 --> 01:01:25.370
<v Speaker 2>history of slavery.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's the same thing,</v>

1392
01:01:25.371 --> 01:01:26.090
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's.</v>

1393
01:01:26.090 --> 01:01:31.090
<v Speaker 2>It's when you moralize write about ideas</v>
<v Speaker 2>that is anti intellectual,</v>

1394
01:01:31.850 --> 01:01:32.870
<v Speaker 2>that is saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

1395
01:01:32.871 --> 01:01:35.120
<v Speaker 2>this thing is outside the realm of </v>
<v Speaker 2>discourse.</v>

1396
01:01:35.330 --> 01:01:40.330
<v Speaker 2>This is outside the realm of inquiry.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's anti intellectual and it's lazy and</v>

1397
01:01:40.400 --> 01:01:43.400
<v Speaker 2>I would say it leads to things that are </v>
<v Speaker 2>worse.</v>

1398
01:01:43.460 --> 01:01:44.293
<v Speaker 2>It leads to things like Donald Trump </v>
<v Speaker 2>because you are repressing again these </v>

1399
01:01:47.601 --> 01:01:48.434
<v Speaker 2>ideas and there are people who just </v>
<v Speaker 2>won't be repressed and they're going to </v>

1400
01:01:50.961 --> 01:01:53.210
<v Speaker 2>come back and they're going to say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1401
01:01:53.300 --> 01:01:54.133
<v Speaker 2>you're playing identity politics.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're saying there's blackness and </v>

1402
01:01:57.231 --> 01:01:58.910
<v Speaker 2>whiteness and you're black and I'm </v>
<v Speaker 2>white.</v>

1403
01:01:58.911 --> 01:01:59.331
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

1404
01:01:59.331 --> 01:02:01.250
<v Speaker 2>fine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now I'm going to say I'm about whiteness</v>

1405
01:02:01.251 --> 01:02:04.310
<v Speaker 2>and being white.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's the problem there.</v>

1406
01:02:04.311 --> 01:02:05.051
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

1407
01:02:05.051 --> 01:02:07.580
<v Speaker 2>it's a very bad thing to avoid that we </v>
<v Speaker 2>have to use these words.</v>

1408
01:02:07.581 --> 01:02:08.414
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's so interesting because I've heard </v>

1409
01:02:09.111 --> 01:02:09.944
<v Speaker 2>people make that argument.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I saw my friend michael shermer make </v>

1410
01:02:12.711 --> 01:02:13.544
<v Speaker 2>that argument about that you're just </v>
<v Speaker 2>creating an identity politics of white </v>

1411
01:02:17.181 --> 01:02:17.510
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>

1412
01:02:17.510 --> 01:02:20.640
<v Speaker 2>And I saw him get into a fight with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with some leftist professor on twitter.</v>

1413
01:02:20.641 --> 01:02:21.301
<v Speaker 2>And I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>by the way,</v>

1414
01:02:21.301 --> 01:02:22.134
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I offered her an opportunity to come </v>

1415
01:02:23.401 --> 01:02:24.810
<v Speaker 2>here and defend her ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She declined.</v>

1416
01:02:25.110 --> 01:02:26.370
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I,</v>

1417
01:02:26.371 --> 01:02:27.204
<v Speaker 2>I so obviously see that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it also leads to all sorts of other </v>

1418
01:02:28.861 --> 01:02:33.270
<v Speaker 2>cultural rot because by taking the word </v>
<v Speaker 2>out of huck finn,</v>

1419
01:02:33.690 --> 01:02:34.770
<v Speaker 2>well now you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1420
01:02:34.830 --> 01:02:37.440
<v Speaker 2>that was a book that's it's not only </v>
<v Speaker 2>stood the test of time,</v>

1421
01:02:37.441 --> 01:02:39.960
<v Speaker 2>but now you're altering the original </v>
<v Speaker 2>meaning.</v>

1422
01:02:40.320 --> 01:02:42.750
<v Speaker 2>Not to mention that huck finn was </v>
<v Speaker 2>antiracist at book,</v>

1423
01:02:43.350 --> 01:02:44.183
<v Speaker 2>which as bill maher has been anti,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the point needs to be made that if </v>

1424
01:02:47.461 --> 01:02:48.294
<v Speaker 2>it were racist,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we still have to use the word not as an </v>

1425
01:02:51.151 --> 01:02:51.961
<v Speaker 2>epithet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Again,</v>

1426
01:02:51.961 --> 01:02:52.794
<v Speaker 2>not the way the racist used the word,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we have to be able to talk about </v>

1427
01:02:55.860 --> 01:02:57.540
<v Speaker 2>racism.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're not.</v>

1428
01:02:57.570 --> 01:02:57.870
<v Speaker 2>Here's the.</v>

1429
01:02:57.870 --> 01:03:02.670
<v Speaker 2>Here's the terrible irony is that by not</v>
<v Speaker 2>being allowed to use that word,</v>

1430
01:03:02.970 --> 01:03:06.900
<v Speaker 2>we are not allowed to talk about racism.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're not allowed to study it.</v>

1431
01:03:06.901 --> 01:03:08.520
<v Speaker 2>Think about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Take it seriously.</v>

1432
01:03:08.640 --> 01:03:10.920
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like in Germany,</v>

1433
01:03:10.921 --> 01:03:11.754
<v Speaker 2>you're not allowed to basically talk </v>
<v Speaker 2>about nazi-ism unless you just sorta </v>

1434
01:03:13.470 --> 01:03:14.303
<v Speaker 2>moralize it really quickly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wouldn't you rather as a jew or an anti </v>

1435
01:03:16.981 --> 01:03:17.814
<v Speaker 2>nazi or any.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Once you rather a study it really hard </v>

1436
01:03:20.461 --> 01:03:22.980
<v Speaker 2>really closely and if you don't want to </v>
<v Speaker 2>return to that,</v>

1437
01:03:23.480 --> 01:03:24.001
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's why.</v>

1438
01:03:24.001 --> 01:03:26.550
<v Speaker 2>I mean as a free speech guy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's why I'm completely against the laws</v>

1439
01:03:26.551 --> 01:03:29.980
<v Speaker 2>that criminalize holocaust denial </v>
<v Speaker 2>because they're.</v>

1440
01:03:29.990 --> 01:03:30.823
<v Speaker 2>They're not going to stop denying it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're just going to go into their </v>

1441
01:03:32.191 --> 01:03:34.350
<v Speaker 2>secret little places and I'd rather </v>
<v Speaker 2>have.</v>

1442
01:03:34.440 --> 01:03:35.273
<v Speaker 2>There are more real nazis in Germany </v>
<v Speaker 2>than in than in the United States where </v>

1443
01:03:38.551 --> 01:03:39.750
<v Speaker 2>we are allowed to talk about it.</v>

1444
01:03:39.920 --> 01:03:40.753
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1445
01:03:41.820 --> 01:03:42.990
<v Speaker 2>But okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so you just,</v>

1446
01:03:42.991 --> 01:03:43.824
<v Speaker 2>so you said the word now I know a </v>
<v Speaker 2>certain amount of people can be angry </v>

1447
01:03:46.110 --> 01:03:48.990
<v Speaker 2>because I have not said the word a </v>
<v Speaker 2>while.</v>

1448
01:03:48.991 --> 01:03:49.824
<v Speaker 2>Sitting here with you right this second.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know that there's a certain costs </v>

1449
01:03:52.621 --> 01:03:53.970
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean,</v>

1450
01:03:53.971 --> 01:03:55.170
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

1451
01:03:55.200 --> 01:03:58.320
<v Speaker 2>And it just has.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You've just sort of shifted past that.</v>

1452
01:03:58.840 --> 01:04:00.170
<v Speaker 2>You've hit your,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

1453
01:04:00.290 --> 01:04:02.910
<v Speaker 2>you've made your sorta philosophical </v>
<v Speaker 2>point now it's just.</v>

1454
01:04:02.940 --> 01:04:04.440
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so just I would just say,</v>

1455
01:04:04.490 --> 01:04:05.323
<v Speaker 2>just listened to what I say after the </v>
<v Speaker 2>word because I very clearly put forward </v>

1456
01:04:10.350 --> 01:04:15.350
<v Speaker 2>why we should use that word and I'm </v>
<v Speaker 2>pretty sure what I said was anti racist.</v>

1457
01:04:15.840 --> 01:04:17.550
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Anti racist.</v>

1458
01:04:17.551 --> 01:04:21.990
<v Speaker 2>That antiracism requires using the word </v>
<v Speaker 2>nigger.</v>

1459
01:04:22.950 --> 01:04:24.510
<v Speaker 2>And that's why all this has been </v>
<v Speaker 2>flipped.</v>

1460
01:04:24.511 --> 01:04:25.344
<v Speaker 2>So then at evergreen state,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to bring this back to 40 minutes ago at </v>

1461
01:04:28.321 --> 01:04:29.760
<v Speaker 2>evergreen state,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have a professor,</v>

1462
01:04:29.761 --> 01:04:30.594
<v Speaker 2>bret weinstein,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who was being anti racist and now he is </v>

1463
01:04:35.401 --> 01:04:36.240
<v Speaker 2>smeared,</v>
<v Speaker 2>racist.</v>

1464
01:04:36.270 --> 01:04:39.270
<v Speaker 2>So I guess that's what it is when you </v>
<v Speaker 2>don't deal with the truth,</v>

1465
01:04:39.271 --> 01:04:40.104
<v Speaker 2>honestly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you end up having to destroy anyone who </v>

1466
01:04:42.391 --> 01:04:44.430
<v Speaker 2>even gets close to it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1467
01:04:44.880 --> 01:04:46.070
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1468
01:04:46.080 --> 01:04:47.220
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Evergreen is,</v>

1469
01:04:47.221 --> 01:04:49.470
<v Speaker 2>I'm not a good luck.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would say,</v>

1470
01:04:50.330 --> 01:04:51.660
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1471
01:04:51.661 --> 01:04:52.494
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I dunno if you want to go into this too </v>

1472
01:04:54.330 --> 01:04:55.021
<v Speaker 2>much,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>

1473
01:04:55.021 --> 01:04:57.480
<v Speaker 2>a lot of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot that's not said about what</v>

1474
01:04:57.810 --> 01:05:01.830
<v Speaker 2>causes this craziness on campuses,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is that,</v>

1475
01:05:01.890 --> 01:05:02.723
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a monopoly that no one talks </v>

1476
01:05:04.861 --> 01:05:06.180
<v Speaker 2>about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No one's even aware of this.</v>

1477
01:05:06.181 --> 01:05:07.014
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wasn't even aware of it until </v>

1478
01:05:07.621 --> 01:05:09.020
<v Speaker 2>recently.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The,</v>

1479
01:05:09.080 --> 01:05:09.913
<v Speaker 2>the department of education and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>federal government authorizes </v>

1480
01:05:13.980 --> 01:05:17.310
<v Speaker 2>accreditation agencies,</v>
<v Speaker 2>accreditation agencies,</v>

1481
01:05:17.410 --> 01:05:20.470
<v Speaker 2>accredited colleges and universities,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they have all these rules.</v>

1482
01:05:20.471 --> 01:05:22.090
<v Speaker 2>It's not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can't just become a college.</v>

1483
01:05:22.091 --> 01:05:24.760
<v Speaker 2>You have to have all these things in </v>
<v Speaker 2>place for them to accredit you.</v>

1484
01:05:25.090 --> 01:05:28.240
<v Speaker 2>Without accreditation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The world doesn't take you seriously.</v>

1485
01:05:28.241 --> 01:05:29.730
<v Speaker 2>Employers don't take you seriously,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1486
01:05:29.740 --> 01:05:32.110
<v Speaker 2>The credentialing is crucial to this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay?</v>

1487
01:05:32.770 --> 01:05:33.603
<v Speaker 2>It's the federal government at the head </v>
<v Speaker 2>of this whole thing of this monopoly </v>

1488
01:05:36.791 --> 01:05:37.720
<v Speaker 2>that they have.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1489
01:05:38.020 --> 01:05:39.970
<v Speaker 2>Then on top of that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's another monopoly within it,</v>

1490
01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:41.680
<v Speaker 2>which is tenure,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the tenure system,</v>

1491
01:05:41.740 --> 01:05:43.690
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So after seven years,</v>

1492
01:05:43.691 --> 01:05:44.524
<v Speaker 2>if you're lucky and you're good and you </v>
<v Speaker 2>follow the rules and you say the right </v>

1493
01:05:47.021 --> 01:05:49.810
<v Speaker 2>things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you get tenure and you're there forever.</v>

1494
01:05:50.020 --> 01:05:52.060
<v Speaker 2>Now who do you think you're going to </v>
<v Speaker 2>hire once you have tenure?</v>

1495
01:05:52.450 --> 01:05:53.283
<v Speaker 2>Someone who is who is contrary to your </v>
<v Speaker 2>ideas or someone who might agree with </v>

1496
01:05:56.231 --> 01:05:57.064
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>someone who makes you look good or </v>

1497
01:05:58.001 --> 01:06:02.500
<v Speaker 2>someone who challenges you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hence we have this uniformity of opinion</v>

1498
01:06:02.680 --> 01:06:05.470
<v Speaker 2>in academia,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is supported,</v>

1499
01:06:05.530 --> 01:06:08.380
<v Speaker 2>defended,</v>
<v Speaker 2>bolstered by this federal government,</v>

1500
01:06:08.560 --> 01:06:11.170
<v Speaker 2>state and force monopoly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No one knows this.</v>

1501
01:06:11.470 --> 01:06:13.930
<v Speaker 2>That's what's going on here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Third thing,</v>

1502
01:06:13.990 --> 01:06:17.890
<v Speaker 2>last thing you add to this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this system of affirmative action,</v>

1503
01:06:17.950 --> 01:06:18.783
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which brings people onto campus who </v>

1504
01:06:21.880 --> 01:06:24.430
<v Speaker 2>according to the rules of affirmative </v>
<v Speaker 2>action,</v>

1505
01:06:24.670 --> 01:06:29.670
<v Speaker 2>have less training in academic work than</v>
<v Speaker 2>other kids.</v>

1506
01:06:30.010 --> 01:06:30.843
<v Speaker 2>So when they get there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of course it's going to be more </v>

1507
01:06:32.831 --> 01:06:34.990
<v Speaker 2>difficult for them to do the academic </v>
<v Speaker 2>work.</v>

1508
01:06:35.350 --> 01:06:37.030
<v Speaker 2>Also,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it has been stated,</v>

1509
01:06:37.090 --> 01:06:42.090
<v Speaker 2>the purpose of diversity and affirmative</v>
<v Speaker 2>action is to have these people represent</v>

1510
01:06:42.520 --> 01:06:45.100
<v Speaker 2>their race.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1511
01:06:45.350 --> 01:06:49.150
<v Speaker 2>And so imagine how crazy that would make</v>
<v Speaker 2>you feel in a classroom when you're like</v>

1512
01:06:49.151 --> 01:06:54.151
<v Speaker 2>one black kid or one whatever kid or two</v>
<v Speaker 2>black kids out of 30 and everybody knows</v>

1513
01:06:55.181 --> 01:06:56.014
<v Speaker 2>why you're there and you're supposed to </v>
<v Speaker 2>represent your race and people are </v>

1514
01:07:00.880 --> 01:07:04.210
<v Speaker 2>wondering assuming that you don't have </v>
<v Speaker 2>the credentials that they do.</v>

1515
01:07:05.170 --> 01:07:06.003
<v Speaker 2>That would make me crazy too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so I almost everything that's been </v>

1516
01:07:08.741 --> 01:07:13.510
<v Speaker 2>said in the race discourse on campuses </v>
<v Speaker 2>over the last three years has been to me</v>

1517
01:07:13.930 --> 01:07:18.130
<v Speaker 2>fraudulent or hysterical and much of it </v>
<v Speaker 2>has been totalitarian by the way.</v>

1518
01:07:18.790 --> 01:07:22.780
<v Speaker 2>But I think there is something at the </v>
<v Speaker 2>bottom of it that's legitimate.</v>

1519
01:07:22.781 --> 01:07:23.614
<v Speaker 2>There's a legitimate grievance that </v>
<v Speaker 2>african american students have </v>

1520
01:07:25.331 --> 01:07:27.810
<v Speaker 2>oncologists that's not addressed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The w,</v>

1521
01:07:27.880 --> 01:07:28.713
<v Speaker 2>the tools.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They have to talk about this our only </v>

1522
01:07:31.391 --> 01:07:33.940
<v Speaker 2>martin luther king and rosa parks and </v>
<v Speaker 2>malcolm x and you know,</v>

1523
01:07:34.120 --> 01:07:37.110
<v Speaker 2>bull connor and oppression and slavery.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's the.</v>

1524
01:07:37.280 --> 01:07:38.113
<v Speaker 2>That's the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the way they talk about it and </v>

1525
01:07:39.821 --> 01:07:40.654
<v Speaker 2>that's uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's unfortunate and that's the fault </v>

1526
01:07:41.741 --> 01:07:44.330
<v Speaker 2>of their professors.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We need to give them language to be able</v>

1527
01:07:44.331 --> 01:07:46.900
<v Speaker 2>to talk about what's really going on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is not good.</v>

1528
01:07:46.901 --> 01:07:49.720
<v Speaker 2>It's not fun for them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's hard.</v>

1529
01:07:49.721 --> 01:07:52.360
<v Speaker 2>I absolutely get that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It could feel oppressive really.</v>

1530
01:07:52.361 --> 01:07:54.490
<v Speaker 2>That word is the word I would use if I </v>
<v Speaker 2>were them,</v>

1531
01:07:55.510 --> 01:07:57.190
<v Speaker 2>but it's not the oppression they're </v>
<v Speaker 2>talking about.</v>

1532
01:07:57.191 --> 01:08:00.550
<v Speaker 2>There is no physical threat to them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There never has been there,</v>

1533
01:08:00.551 --> 01:08:01.400
<v Speaker 2>but they're.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1534
01:08:02.180 --> 01:08:03.013
<v Speaker 1>Interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1535
01:08:03.250 --> 01:08:05.660
<v Speaker 1>I referenced my interview with jason </v>
<v Speaker 1>whitlock miller,</v>

1536
01:08:05.661 --> 01:08:06.494
<v Speaker 1>but he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he saId something to that effect that </v>

1537
01:08:07.551 --> 01:08:09.590
<v Speaker 1>basically the oppression is different </v>
<v Speaker 1>now.</v>

1538
01:08:10.070 --> 01:08:10.903
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you have to then change tactics you </v>

1539
01:08:12.651 --> 01:08:15.310
<v Speaker 1>can't be doing fighting the way that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>

1540
01:08:15.390 --> 01:08:16.223
<v Speaker 1>a Jesse Jackson or a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a al sharpton is using the language of </v>

1541
01:08:20.001 --> 01:08:22.770
<v Speaker 1>the old thing when there's a whole </v>
<v Speaker 1>different system in play.</v>

1542
01:08:22.771 --> 01:08:23.450
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

1543
01:08:23.450 --> 01:08:25.340
<v Speaker 1>Where you could get more natural allies.</v>

1544
01:08:25.490 --> 01:08:26.990
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I'm only talkIng about academia.</v>

1545
01:08:27.010 --> 01:08:27.311
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1546
01:08:27.311 --> 01:08:29.840
<v Speaker 2>I'm not talking about being a 19 year </v>
<v Speaker 2>old in ferguson,</v>

1547
01:08:29.841 --> 01:08:32.330
<v Speaker 2>Missouri.</v>
<v Speaker 2>ThAt's a different ballgame entirely.</v>

1548
01:08:32.690 --> 01:08:35.150
<v Speaker 2>I'm talking about academia and I know </v>
<v Speaker 2>that world very well.</v>

1549
01:08:35.151 --> 01:08:35.984
<v Speaker 2>Those are the rules of the world and </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what happens to these black kids </v>

1550
01:08:38.330 --> 01:08:39.530
<v Speaker 2>there plucked out of these </v>
<v Speaker 2>neighborhoods,</v>

1551
01:08:39.531 --> 01:08:40.880
<v Speaker 2>put in these classrooms and said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

1552
01:08:40.970 --> 01:08:43.910
<v Speaker 2>go ahead represent your race.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're goIng to pay you to do that.</v>

1553
01:08:44.900 --> 01:08:46.250
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's going to make you crazy.</v>

1554
01:08:46.251 --> 01:08:47.084
<v Speaker 2>So that's a different.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's what I call liberal or racial </v>

1555
01:08:50.211 --> 01:08:51.044
<v Speaker 2>liberalism.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's this idea of the representative </v>

1556
01:08:53.931 --> 01:08:58.760
<v Speaker 2>race and the idea that we will give them</v>
<v Speaker 2>the chance to prove themselves that they</v>

1557
01:08:58.761 --> 01:09:02.630
<v Speaker 2>can be just like us.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there's an assimilationist impulse in</v>

1558
01:09:02.631 --> 01:09:05.210
<v Speaker 2>there too,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or an assimilation is the expectation.</v>

1559
01:09:05.930 --> 01:09:09.080
<v Speaker 2>We're going to show the world that these</v>
<v Speaker 2>black people can be just like us,</v>

1560
01:09:09.081 --> 01:09:12.350
<v Speaker 2>which by the way is kind of white </v>
<v Speaker 2>supremacist in a way,</v>

1561
01:09:12.351 --> 01:09:13.190
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because they're sayiNg,</v>

1562
01:09:13.191 --> 01:09:14.930
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>our world of course is the Best one.</v>

1563
01:09:15.110 --> 01:09:16.940
<v Speaker 2>HArvard of course,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is the best place to be.</v>

1564
01:09:17.630 --> 01:09:18.463
<v Speaker 2>That's incredibly elitist and superior </v>
<v Speaker 2>and probably white supremacists because </v>

1565
01:09:21.111 --> 01:09:23.840
<v Speaker 2>harvard of course is historically a very</v>
<v Speaker 2>white institution,</v>

1566
01:09:24.290 --> 01:09:27.290
<v Speaker 2>so just let people do what they want to </v>
<v Speaker 2>do.</v>

1567
01:09:27.320 --> 01:09:29.840
<v Speaker 2>We don't have to expect them to go to </v>
<v Speaker 2>harvard.</v>

1568
01:09:30.850 --> 01:09:33.250
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I suspect we're going to do this again,</v>

1569
01:09:33.460 --> 01:09:34.293
<v Speaker 1>but I want to ask you one final thing </v>
<v Speaker 1>and I think it's sort of been a through </v>

1570
01:09:36.401 --> 01:09:39.340
<v Speaker 1>line to what you're talking about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I sent sort of like an alternate,</v>

1571
01:09:39.350 --> 01:09:40.183
<v Speaker 1>so there's sort of a world weariness to </v>
<v Speaker 1>you and then also like a total sense of </v>

1572
01:09:44.201 --> 01:09:47.770
<v Speaker 1>opportunity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you think these things are in like 50</v>

1573
01:09:47.771 --> 01:09:49.630
<v Speaker 1>slash 50 with you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because I have a lot of that too.</v>

1574
01:09:49.631 --> 01:09:51.320
<v Speaker 1>I am definitely world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We,</v>

1575
01:09:51.340 --> 01:09:52.173
<v Speaker 1>I worry about the state of the world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what is going to haPpen to the western </v>

1576
01:09:56.381 --> 01:09:57.214
<v Speaker 1>world and society and all these trends </v>
<v Speaker 1>that I talked about that I think are so </v>

1577
01:09:59.861 --> 01:10:03.610
<v Speaker 1>dangerous and yet I could never do this </v>
<v Speaker 1>if I didn't have optimism and care about</v>

1578
01:10:03.611 --> 01:10:04.444
<v Speaker 1>the ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I sensed that constantly embattled </v>

1579
01:10:06.101 --> 01:10:07.990
<v Speaker 1>how,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where are your percentages?</v>

1580
01:10:07.991 --> 01:10:10.510
<v Speaker 1>Where do you get all that to get out of </v>
<v Speaker 1>bed and do what you do?</v>

1581
01:10:10.570 --> 01:10:12.270
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1582
01:10:12.460 --> 01:10:13.293
<v Speaker 2>people are wealthier than ever before.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There iS less poverty in the world than </v>

1583
01:10:16.481 --> 01:10:17.314
<v Speaker 2>ever before.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so I'm very optimistic about that </v>

1584
01:10:21.520 --> 01:10:24.430
<v Speaker 2>going forward.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I constantly worry about war.</v>

1585
01:10:24.640 --> 01:10:25.570
<v Speaker 2>I do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1586
01:10:25.571 --> 01:10:27.730
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>world war two was not that long ago.</v>

1587
01:10:27.790 --> 01:10:31.630
<v Speaker 2>Vietnam wasn't that long ago.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Millions of people died in that war that</v>

1588
01:10:31.631 --> 01:10:33.640
<v Speaker 2>could happen literally at any minute,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1589
01:10:33.641 --> 01:10:34.474
<v Speaker 2>thinking about the middle east and these</v>
<v Speaker 2>new coalitions that are forming right </v>

1590
01:10:36.521 --> 01:10:37.354
<v Speaker 2>now and we have the saudi,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the sunni side with the saudis and the </v>

1591
01:10:39.911 --> 01:10:44.911
<v Speaker 2>us and Israel against the shia side with</v>
<v Speaker 2>Iran and Syria and Russia.</v>

1592
01:10:45.580 --> 01:10:48.340
<v Speaker 2>And if Turkey makes his decision to go </v>
<v Speaker 2>with the,</v>

1593
01:10:48.480 --> 01:10:49.313
<v Speaker 2>with the shia,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which it very well might because of the </v>

1594
01:10:50.381 --> 01:10:52.720
<v Speaker 2>kurds.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then look what we have there.</v>

1595
01:10:52.780 --> 01:10:56.950
<v Speaker 2>We have two huge military alliances </v>
<v Speaker 2>potentially fighting each other.</v>

1596
01:10:56.951 --> 01:10:59.830
<v Speaker 2>That's terrifying to me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I'm always worried about war.</v>

1597
01:10:59.831 --> 01:11:02.770
<v Speaker 2>I always will be so long as there are </v>
<v Speaker 2>militaries and there probably will be,</v>

1598
01:11:03.310 --> 01:11:04.780
<v Speaker 2>but so I'm split.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what to say.</v>

1599
01:11:05.960 --> 01:11:07.630
<v Speaker 1>You know what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm okay with anything a show on.</v>

1600
01:11:07.640 --> 01:11:08.473
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if I can say that's the </v>
<v Speaker 1>difference between this show and most </v>

1601
