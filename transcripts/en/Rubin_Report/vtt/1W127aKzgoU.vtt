1
00:00:05.090 --> 00:00:05.923
<v Speaker 1>We're continuing our partnership with </v>
<v Speaker 1>learn liberty today and joining me is </v>

2
00:00:08.391 --> 00:00:12.560
<v Speaker 1>the former president of the Acl,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you a board member for fire,</v>

3
00:00:12.561 --> 00:00:13.394
<v Speaker 1>epic and the Heterodox Academy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a professor at New York law school and </v>

4
00:00:17.571 --> 00:00:22.571
<v Speaker 1>author of the new book hate why we </v>
<v Speaker 1>should resist it with free speech,</v>

5
00:00:22.671 --> 00:00:23.504
<v Speaker 1>not censorship,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nadian Strauss and welcome to the Rubin </v>

6
00:00:25.611 --> 00:00:26.900
<v Speaker 1>report to be here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dave.</v>

7
00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:27.943
<v Speaker 1>So I have to tell you when I was reading</v>
<v Speaker 1>through your bio and looking at all the </v>

8
00:00:31.341 --> 00:00:34.160
<v Speaker 1>boards you've sat on and head of Acl,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you and all that,</v>

9
00:00:34.161 --> 00:00:34.994
<v Speaker 1>I don't know that anyone has ever been </v>
<v Speaker 1>more of sort of a perfect prime guests </v>

10
00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:39.433
<v Speaker 1>to sit in that chair and my prayer book </v>
<v Speaker 1>defending pornography that caught your </v>

11
00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:46.400
<v Speaker 1>attention.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We can get into that too,</v>

12
00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:47.263
<v Speaker 1>but really your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your life's work is sort of exactly why </v>

13
00:00:50.241 --> 00:00:55.241
<v Speaker 1>I do this show and I know I'm setting </v>
<v Speaker 1>you up now with a very high bar here,</v>

14
00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:55.870
<v Speaker 1>but.</v>

15
00:00:55.870 --> 00:00:58.970
<v Speaker 1>But this is what it's all about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thank you so much and thank you for your</v>

16
00:00:58.971 --> 00:01:03.350
<v Speaker 1>ardent defense of liberty.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is the most important value for me.</v>

17
00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:06.650
<v Speaker 1>And when people ask me what my politics </v>
<v Speaker 1>are,</v>

18
00:01:06.651 --> 00:01:07.484
<v Speaker 1>I usually say I care more about my civil</v>
<v Speaker 1>libertarian beliefs than I care about </v>

19
00:01:12.471 --> 00:01:13.304
<v Speaker 1>partisan political beliefs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and one of the things that's true for </v>

20
00:01:15.711 --> 00:01:20.711
<v Speaker 1>the Acu as well as for me as an </v>
<v Speaker 1>individual is not taking per say,</v>

21
00:01:21.561 --> 00:01:24.440
<v Speaker 1>across the board positions on any </v>
<v Speaker 1>candidate,</v>

22
00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:25.453
<v Speaker 1>official party or group,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but judging on an issue by issue basis </v>

23
00:01:29.691 --> 00:01:30.524
<v Speaker 1>and issuing a criticism or a or praise </v>
<v Speaker 1>on an issue by issue basis and there's </v>

24
00:01:36.501 --> 00:01:37.334
<v Speaker 1>not a single party or candidate or </v>
<v Speaker 1>official that hasn't earned some praise </v>

25
00:01:40.911 --> 00:01:44.330
<v Speaker 1>and some criticism on some important </v>
<v Speaker 1>civil liberties issues.</v>

26
00:01:44.331 --> 00:01:47.390
<v Speaker 1>So looking at the glass half full as an </v>
<v Speaker 1>activist,</v>

27
00:01:47.391 --> 00:01:48.224
<v Speaker 1>I always do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's nobody with whom I don't share </v>

28
00:01:51.021 --> 00:01:54.560
<v Speaker 1>some really strong convictions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is very nice.</v>

29
00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:55.393
<v Speaker 1>Now it's also true that there's nobody </v>
<v Speaker 1>with whom I have some strong </v>

30
00:01:58.311 --> 00:01:59.144
<v Speaker 1>disagreements,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm used to therefore having a </v>

31
00:02:02.301 --> 00:02:03.134
<v Speaker 1>positive relationship across ideological</v>
<v Speaker 1>divides and the absence of that or the </v>

32
00:02:08.901 --> 00:02:12.320
<v Speaker 1>fading of that in today's climate is </v>
<v Speaker 1>very bothersome.</v>

33
00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:13.493
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What a great place to start this </v>

34
00:02:14.751 --> 00:02:17.990
<v Speaker 1>conversation then.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So as you've seen that fail,</v>

35
00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:18.883
<v Speaker 1>that fade in society,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you have a couple of markers or </v>

36
00:02:22.041 --> 00:02:27.041
<v Speaker 1>moments where you started to really see </v>
<v Speaker 1>it or has it just been a slow slide into</v>

37
00:02:27.711 --> 00:02:29.300
<v Speaker 1>wherever it seems that we're at at the </v>
<v Speaker 1>moment?</v>

38
00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:31.430
<v Speaker 1>That's a really good question,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dave,</v>

39
00:02:31.431 --> 00:02:35.480
<v Speaker 1>and I'm sure some sociologists have </v>
<v Speaker 1>probably analyze it more.</v>

40
00:02:35.481 --> 00:02:39.350
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My impression is,</v>

41
00:02:39.351 --> 00:02:43.070
<v Speaker 1>at least on issues,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's stay with issues of free speech.</v>

42
00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:44.173
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my strong impression is that there </v>

43
00:02:46.071 --> 00:02:51.071
<v Speaker 1>started to be a real breaking point in </v>
<v Speaker 1>around 2015.</v>

44
00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.300
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that's when we had the ferguson.</v>

45
00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:57.173
<v Speaker 1>I'm a riots and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>demonstrations and protests around the </v>

46
00:03:02.141 --> 00:03:07.141
<v Speaker 1>country and I am completely sympathetic </v>
<v Speaker 1>to that cause believe me,</v>

47
00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:08.863
<v Speaker 1>abuses in the criminal justice system.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have been on my radar screen and the </v>

48
00:03:12.461 --> 00:03:13.294
<v Speaker 1>acl for ever a way back in the dark ages</v>
<v Speaker 1>or some would say the ages of the I </v>

49
00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:24.180
<v Speaker 1>meant only in the sense of old wasn't a </v>
<v Speaker 1>stigmatizing referenced,</v>

50
00:03:24.181 --> 00:03:28.390
<v Speaker 1>but the Reagan administration.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I used to debate his attorney,</v>

51
00:03:28.391 --> 00:03:29.224
<v Speaker 1>General Ed meese on proposition such as </v>
<v Speaker 1>is the criminal justice system racially </v>

52
00:03:35.441 --> 00:03:37.660
<v Speaker 1>discriminatory.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the,</v>

53
00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:39.610
<v Speaker 1>and I was taking the yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>possession,</v>

54
00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:44.760
<v Speaker 1>so the fact that we have this outpouring</v>
<v Speaker 1>and support of social justice and Racial</v>

55
00:03:45.161 --> 00:03:45.994
<v Speaker 1>Justice and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>immigrants rights and antisexual </v>

56
00:03:49.091 --> 00:03:50.860
<v Speaker 1>violence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all of that is wonderful.</v>

57
00:03:50.861 --> 00:03:51.694
<v Speaker 1>But starting several years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it started to seem more and more that </v>

58
00:03:57.100 --> 00:03:57.933
<v Speaker 1>advocates of these causes began to see </v>
<v Speaker 1>free speech as their enemy rather than </v>

59
00:04:04.751 --> 00:04:05.584
<v Speaker 1>what I know it to be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is they're time tested essential </v>

60
00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:10.473
<v Speaker 1>ally.</v>

61
00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:11.433
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so there was this pitting of liberty </v>

62
00:04:13.421 --> 00:04:18.421
<v Speaker 1>against equality of civil rights,</v>
<v Speaker 1>against civil liberties.</v>

63
00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:19.593
<v Speaker 1>And as I say that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I realized that it was the second time </v>

64
00:04:22.721 --> 00:04:25.750
<v Speaker 1>that had happened in my adult lifetime.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The first time that,</v>

65
00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:29.860
<v Speaker 1>that happened very strongly was in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>late 19 eighties,</v>

66
00:04:29.890 --> 00:04:30.723
<v Speaker 1>early 19 nineties,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which was the first time that hate </v>

67
00:04:33.971 --> 00:04:37.210
<v Speaker 1>speech codes were proposed on college </v>
<v Speaker 1>campus.</v>

68
00:04:37.211 --> 00:04:38.044
<v Speaker 1>It's the first time we started seeing </v>
<v Speaker 1>criticism of what was called political </v>

69
00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:44.500
<v Speaker 1>correctness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then to,</v>

70
00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:49.740
<v Speaker 1>especially law professors were arguing </v>
<v Speaker 1>very strongly that you have to choose.</v>

71
00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:52.930
<v Speaker 1>You can't have both liberty and </v>
<v Speaker 1>equality.</v>

72
00:04:52.931 --> 00:04:56.740
<v Speaker 1>And that's anathema to my own beliefs </v>
<v Speaker 1>and experience.</v>

73
00:04:56.900 --> 00:04:59.080
<v Speaker 1>And that's kind of where we're at right </v>
<v Speaker 1>now.</v>

74
00:04:59.081 --> 00:05:01.690
<v Speaker 1>That seems to be where this argument has</v>
<v Speaker 1>boiled down to.</v>

75
00:05:01.691 --> 00:05:05.230
<v Speaker 1>So before we unpack all of that stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how did you get involved in this?</v>

76
00:05:05.231 --> 00:05:06.064
<v Speaker 1>What was it about your education or your</v>
<v Speaker 1>upbringing or whatever else that made </v>

77
00:05:10.031 --> 00:05:13.060
<v Speaker 1>you care about free speech,</v>
<v Speaker 1>civil liberties,</v>

78
00:05:13.061 --> 00:05:13.894
<v Speaker 1>everything else that you've just </v>
<v Speaker 1>mentioned it as far back as I can </v>

79
00:05:15.761 --> 00:05:16.570
<v Speaker 1>remember.</v>

80
00:05:16.570 --> 00:05:17.403
<v Speaker 1>I have been in favor of individual </v>
<v Speaker 1>liberty and resisting anybody who tried </v>

81
00:05:22.241 --> 00:05:26.020
<v Speaker 1>to encroach on my liberty or that of </v>
<v Speaker 1>anybody else's.</v>

82
00:05:26.021 --> 00:05:30.520
<v Speaker 1>So long before I had the terminology,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I resisted my parents,</v>

83
00:05:30.521 --> 00:05:34.150
<v Speaker 1>authoritarianism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my school teacher authoritarianism.</v>

84
00:05:34.510 --> 00:05:36.580
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was kind of a contrarian.</v>

85
00:05:36.581 --> 00:05:38.980
<v Speaker 1>I would always like to see a different </v>
<v Speaker 1>perspective.</v>

86
00:05:38.981 --> 00:05:42.910
<v Speaker 1>And I remember being very puzzled as a </v>
<v Speaker 1>fairly young student.</v>

87
00:05:42.911 --> 00:05:46.750
<v Speaker 1>Maybe I was about 10 or 11 years old and</v>
<v Speaker 1>a teacher said to me,</v>

88
00:05:46.780 --> 00:05:47.613
<v Speaker 1>own a dean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why do you always have to defend the </v>

89
00:05:50.231 --> 00:05:53.590
<v Speaker 1>underdog?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And she said it as a criticism and to me</v>

90
00:05:53.591 --> 00:05:54.130
<v Speaker 1>it was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

91
00:05:54.130 --> 00:05:54.963
<v Speaker 1>they're the ones that need the defense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have also always valued freedom of </v>

92
00:06:00.321 --> 00:06:05.321
<v Speaker 1>speech for ideas that I disagree with.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I remember I was in college,</v>

93
00:06:06.770 --> 00:06:10.010
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>from 1968 to 1972,</v>

94
00:06:10.310 --> 00:06:11.143
<v Speaker 1>a very involved in the movement against </v>
<v Speaker 1>the Vietnam War Movement for </v>

95
00:06:17.031 --> 00:06:18.440
<v Speaker 1>reproductive freedom.</v>

96
00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:21.770
<v Speaker 1>That was before the Supreme Court </v>
<v Speaker 1>decided Roe v Dot Wade again,</v>

97
00:06:21.771 --> 00:06:23.810
<v Speaker 1>that really dark ages,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

98
00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:28.840
<v Speaker 1>but I also always defended freedom for </v>
<v Speaker 1>people who disagreed with me,</v>

99
00:06:29.181 --> 00:06:30.014
<v Speaker 1>so I would have lot big arguments with </v>
<v Speaker 1>members of SDS students for Democratic </v>

100
00:06:37.190 --> 00:06:39.080
<v Speaker 1>Society,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very radical organization that wanted to</v>

101
00:06:39.081 --> 00:06:39.914
<v Speaker 1>shout down certain speakers that were in</v>
<v Speaker 1>favor of the Vietnam war administration </v>

102
00:06:44.841 --> 00:06:48.320
<v Speaker 1>officials and so forth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And while I disagreed with the points of</v>

103
00:06:48.321 --> 00:06:51.710
<v Speaker 1>view of those speakers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't believe it that they should,</v>

104
00:06:51.920 --> 00:06:55.760
<v Speaker 1>that we should be denying them a podium.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So as far back as I remember,</v>

105
00:06:55.761 --> 00:06:56.594
<v Speaker 1>I've been a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I cared much more about freedom in part </v>

106
00:07:01.221 --> 00:07:06.221
<v Speaker 1>because I do see that as the essential </v>
<v Speaker 1>means to advance whatever other cause is</v>

107
00:07:08.421 --> 00:07:09.254
<v Speaker 1>dear to you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's hard to defend the people that you </v>

108
00:07:11.361 --> 00:07:12.240
<v Speaker 1>don't like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>isn't it?</v>

109
00:07:12.241 --> 00:07:14.690
<v Speaker 1>It seems to me that that's the one we're</v>
<v Speaker 1>forgetting these days.</v>

110
00:07:14.691 --> 00:07:17.540
<v Speaker 1>Like everyone screams about free speech </v>
<v Speaker 1>all the time.</v>

111
00:07:17.990 --> 00:07:22.490
<v Speaker 1>The second someone says they don't like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then they kind of get quiet real quick.</v>

112
00:07:22.520 --> 00:07:23.353
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I was shortly after I graduated from </v>

113
00:07:25.971 --> 00:07:27.220
<v Speaker 1>law school,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

114
00:07:27.230 --> 00:07:31.610
<v Speaker 1>the Acu and I was not involved at the </v>
<v Speaker 1>national level at all at that point,</v>

115
00:07:31.611 --> 00:07:32.444
<v Speaker 1>but the acl,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you got involved in the infamous or </v>

116
00:07:35.061 --> 00:07:39.590
<v Speaker 1>famous skokie case and that was like a </v>
<v Speaker 1>real litmus test.</v>

117
00:07:39.591 --> 00:07:44.591
<v Speaker 1>I assume most viewers know what that is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but for those who might not in 1977,</v>

118
00:07:45.711 --> 00:07:46.544
<v Speaker 1>the acu came to the defense of the free </v>
<v Speaker 1>speech rights of a group of neo Nazis </v>

119
00:07:52.820 --> 00:07:53.653
<v Speaker 1>who wanted to demonstrate in Skokie,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Illinois a suburb of Chicago that had a </v>

120
00:07:58.881 --> 00:07:59.714
<v Speaker 1>large Jewish population and a large </v>
<v Speaker 1>population of Holocaust survivors and </v>

121
00:08:05.570 --> 00:08:09.830
<v Speaker 1>many members of the acl,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you even this stalwart,</v>

122
00:08:09.831 --> 00:08:10.664
<v Speaker 1>free speech organization a loss.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We lost about 15 percent of our members </v>

123
00:08:15.591 --> 00:08:18.080
<v Speaker 1>who said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we really defend free speech,</v>

124
00:08:18.170 --> 00:08:19.003
<v Speaker 1>but this is the one exception we want to</v>
<v Speaker 1>make for this absolutely abhorrent </v>

125
00:08:22.971 --> 00:08:23.690
<v Speaker 1>speech.</v>

126
00:08:23.690 --> 00:08:28.690
<v Speaker 1>Now my father is a holocaust survivor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have to say was sadly he died,</v>

127
00:08:29.541 --> 00:08:34.541
<v Speaker 1>but it wasn't even an issue for me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have to tell you,</v>

128
00:08:35.061 --> 00:08:35.894
<v Speaker 1>dave,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's coming back to your question </v>

129
00:08:37.221 --> 00:08:38.054
<v Speaker 1>because you said something about how </v>
<v Speaker 1>does it feel to defend people that you </v>

130
00:08:42.831 --> 00:08:46.940
<v Speaker 1>disagree with and to me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I never defending them.</v>

131
00:08:47.270 --> 00:08:51.410
<v Speaker 1>I'm never defending their ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm never defending.</v>

132
00:08:51.411 --> 00:08:52.244
<v Speaker 1>What did they say?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I am defending the principle that </v>

133
00:08:55.891 --> 00:09:00.891
<v Speaker 1>government should not have power to </v>
<v Speaker 1>silence speech just because the majority</v>

134
00:09:03.001 --> 00:09:03.834
<v Speaker 1>of the public,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even the vast majority of the public </v>

135
00:09:06.420 --> 00:09:07.253
<v Speaker 1>low.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This despises the idea that the speech </v>

136
00:09:09.741 --> 00:09:10.980
<v Speaker 1>is conveying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

137
00:09:11.040 --> 00:09:11.873
<v Speaker 1>so that's incredible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Obviously I know the skokie case well </v>

138
00:09:13.611 --> 00:09:14.444
<v Speaker 1>and I'm sure many much of my audiences,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't realize 15 percent did you say </v>

139
00:09:17.371 --> 00:09:20.610
<v Speaker 1>50 percent of the membership of a clu </v>
<v Speaker 1>members.</v>

140
00:09:20.760 --> 00:09:23.610
<v Speaker 1>That's a massive amount of so and and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you know it.</v>

141
00:09:23.620 --> 00:09:27.510
<v Speaker 1>So the ACO,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you really put its money where its mouth</v>

142
00:09:27.511 --> 00:09:30.510
<v Speaker 1>is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was a tremendous financial hit,</v>

143
00:09:30.960 --> 00:09:34.350
<v Speaker 1>a and there was a lot of negative press.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

144
00:09:34.410 --> 00:09:38.100
<v Speaker 1>in fairness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a fairly soon after that,</v>

145
00:09:38.101 --> 00:09:41.700
<v Speaker 1>the ACL,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you began to recoup members,</v>

146
00:09:41.701 --> 00:09:43.920
<v Speaker 1>maybe not necessarily the same people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

147
00:09:43.921 --> 00:09:44.754
<v Speaker 1>other people who wrote in and said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we see that you really aren't neutrally </v>

148
00:09:48.781 --> 00:09:49.614
<v Speaker 1>defending civil liberties even for </v>
<v Speaker 1>people that are anti civil or raised </v>

149
00:09:53.281 --> 00:09:54.120
<v Speaker 1>themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now.</v>

150
00:09:54.330 --> 00:09:55.980
<v Speaker 1>That's sad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have to tell you,</v>

151
00:09:56.220 --> 00:09:58.980
<v Speaker 1>almost every time I give a speech </v>
<v Speaker 1>anywhere,</v>

152
00:09:59.190 --> 00:10:03.120
<v Speaker 1>people will come up to me and say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was an acl EU member,</v>

153
00:10:03.121 --> 00:10:06.740
<v Speaker 1>but I quit over skokie and a Ra,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nih,</v>

154
00:10:06.741 --> 00:10:08.970
<v Speaker 1>or who was the executive director at the</v>
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>

155
00:10:08.971 --> 00:10:13.260
<v Speaker 1>And interestingly enough himself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a Holocaust survivor.</v>

156
00:10:13.440 --> 00:10:14.273
<v Speaker 1>He was born in Berlin.</v>
<v Speaker 1>His extended family was completely </v>

157
00:10:17.731 --> 00:10:22.380
<v Speaker 1>exterminated by the Nazis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He and his immediate family escaped and,</v>

158
00:10:22.740 --> 00:10:23.573
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he wrote a wonderful book about it </v>

159
00:10:24.751 --> 00:10:28.290
<v Speaker 1>afterwards called defending my enemy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I quote in my book,</v>

160
00:10:28.680 --> 00:10:29.513
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we can talk about how that might </v>

161
00:10:31.501 --> 00:10:34.080
<v Speaker 1>seem paradoxical,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's really not.</v>

162
00:10:34.080 --> 00:10:35.490
<v Speaker 1>But anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in this context,</v>

163
00:10:35.491 --> 00:10:38.220
<v Speaker 1>I brought him up because he said to me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nadine,</v>

164
00:10:38.221 --> 00:10:41.650
<v Speaker 1>if every person who said they left the </v>
<v Speaker 1>acl,</v>

165
00:10:41.651 --> 00:10:44.360
<v Speaker 1>you over skokie really had been a </v>
<v Speaker 1>member.</v>

166
00:10:44.370 --> 00:10:45.203
<v Speaker 1>We would have been the largest </v>
<v Speaker 1>organization in the world ever talking </v>

167
00:10:48.451 --> 00:10:52.440
<v Speaker 1>to a game.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you will see if I can just follow up</v>

168
00:10:52.441 --> 00:10:53.274
<v Speaker 1>on that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not just an abstract principle </v>

169
00:10:55.081 --> 00:11:00.081
<v Speaker 1>because you can really see how the </v>
<v Speaker 1>principal has concrete ramifications for</v>

170
00:11:00.361 --> 00:11:05.040
<v Speaker 1>exactly the opposite idea,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so in our briefs and the skokie case,</v>

171
00:11:05.041 --> 00:11:05.874
<v Speaker 1>we pointed out that the arguments that </v>
<v Speaker 1>were being made to justify suppressing </v>

172
00:11:10.920 --> 00:11:11.753
<v Speaker 1>the Nazis,</v>
<v Speaker 1>namely that their ideas were offensive </v>

173
00:11:14.850 --> 00:11:15.683
<v Speaker 1>and insulting and threatening and seen </v>
<v Speaker 1>as dangerous to the Jews and the </v>

174
00:11:20.041 --> 00:11:20.874
<v Speaker 1>Holocaust survivors in skokie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was exactly the same set of </v>

175
00:11:24.301 --> 00:11:25.134
<v Speaker 1>arguments that was made not that much </v>
<v Speaker 1>earlier in 1968 when Martin Luther King </v>

176
00:11:30.450 --> 00:11:34.170
<v Speaker 1>was trying to demonstrate in Cicero,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Illinois,</v>

177
00:11:34.260 --> 00:11:35.093
<v Speaker 1>the very same state,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but with a very different population </v>

178
00:11:37.441 --> 00:11:41.280
<v Speaker 1>that saw his ideas as threatening and </v>
<v Speaker 1>dangerous and subversive,</v>

179
00:11:41.281 --> 00:11:42.114
<v Speaker 1>offensive and insulting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is where this weird subjective </v>

180
00:11:44.671 --> 00:11:45.504
<v Speaker 1>nature of this comes in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is why you've said several times </v>

181
00:11:47.341 --> 00:11:49.680
<v Speaker 1>now you're defending the principal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not the person,</v>

182
00:11:49.850 --> 00:11:53.140
<v Speaker 1>and that that of course is the is the </v>
<v Speaker 1>key to this whole thing,</v>

183
00:11:53.141 --> 00:11:54.100
<v Speaker 1>but we've been pushed</v>

184
00:11:54.100 --> 00:11:58.390
<v Speaker 2>into this place these days where it </v>
<v Speaker 2>seems like there's a large set of people</v>

185
00:11:58.391 --> 00:12:03.391
<v Speaker 2>or certainly a set of very loud people </v>
<v Speaker 2>who think that speech is violent.</v>

186
00:12:05.140 --> 00:12:05.973
<v Speaker 1>It ain't violence well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I suppose speech could advocate </v>

187
00:12:09.281 --> 00:12:11.800
<v Speaker 1>violence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it could incite violence,</v>

188
00:12:11.801 --> 00:12:13.300
<v Speaker 1>it could threaten violence.</v>

189
00:12:13.310 --> 00:12:14.143
<v Speaker 2>So do you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So do you agree with where we have the </v>

190
00:12:15.501 --> 00:12:18.440
<v Speaker 2>law is now in terms of you can't </v>
<v Speaker 2>directly insight and that sort of thing.</v>

191
00:12:18.441 --> 00:12:20.920
<v Speaker 2>Do you think all those laws are are just</v>
<v Speaker 2>inappropriate?</v>

192
00:12:21.050 --> 00:12:21.883
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I have to say even though I've been </v>

193
00:12:23.061 --> 00:12:26.540
<v Speaker 1>teaching constitutional law,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the First Amendment for decades,</v>

194
00:12:26.541 --> 00:12:27.374
<v Speaker 1>the process of writing this book and </v>
<v Speaker 1>thinking about it and even more focused </v>

195
00:12:30.921 --> 00:12:31.754
<v Speaker 1>fashion really increased my respect for </v>
<v Speaker 1>us law and I really think that for many </v>

196
00:12:38.211 --> 00:12:39.044
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if they would just understand what the </v>

197
00:12:41.781 --> 00:12:42.614
<v Speaker 1>law actually provides,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they would be much more supportive of </v>

198
00:12:46.641 --> 00:12:47.474
<v Speaker 1>freedom of speech because it is much </v>
<v Speaker 1>more nuanced and much more common </v>

199
00:12:50.961 --> 00:12:55.961
<v Speaker 1>sensical than is often misdescribe when </v>
<v Speaker 1>people say either,</v>

200
00:12:56.030 --> 00:12:58.400
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hate speech is not free speech.</v>

201
00:12:58.700 --> 00:12:59.533
<v Speaker 1>We heard here that a lot,</v>
<v Speaker 1>including when you were at the </v>

202
00:13:02.330 --> 00:13:03.170
<v Speaker 1>University of New Hampshire,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we are that a lot.</v>

203
00:13:03.171 --> 00:13:05.690
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then conversely,</v>

204
00:13:05.691 --> 00:13:06.710
<v Speaker 1>people will say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

205
00:13:06.720 --> 00:13:11.570
<v Speaker 1>hate speech is protected and neither </v>
<v Speaker 1>generalization is correct.</v>

206
00:13:11.870 --> 00:13:13.060
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I.</v>

207
00:13:13.280 --> 00:13:14.113
<v Speaker 1>The fact that speech has a hateful or </v>
<v Speaker 1>hated message idea or content can never </v>

208
00:13:22.071 --> 00:13:24.710
<v Speaker 1>be adjusted if occasion for censoring </v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

209
00:13:24.920 --> 00:13:25.753
<v Speaker 1>but if in a particular context,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a hateful message along with any other </v>

210
00:13:31.431 --> 00:13:32.264
<v Speaker 1>message directly causes certain serious,</v>
<v Speaker 1>specific imminent harm and there's no </v>

211
00:13:39.921 --> 00:13:43.250
<v Speaker 1>way to avert that harm other than </v>
<v Speaker 1>punishing the speech,</v>

212
00:13:43.430 --> 00:13:44.263
<v Speaker 1>then the speech can and should be </v>
<v Speaker 1>punished and common examples that </v>

213
00:13:48.021 --> 00:13:53.021
<v Speaker 1>satisfy that standard are intentional </v>
<v Speaker 1>incitement of imminent violence,</v>

214
00:13:53.240 --> 00:13:57.800
<v Speaker 1>a genuine threat that instills fear that</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to be subject to violence.</v>

215
00:13:58.040 --> 00:13:58.930
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

216
00:13:59.010 --> 00:14:03.380
<v Speaker 1>another example is a hate crime and that</v>
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>

217
00:14:03.460 --> 00:14:04.040
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

218
00:14:04.040 --> 00:14:07.310
<v Speaker 1>it's a little bit different in the sense</v>
<v Speaker 1>that a,</v>

219
00:14:07.311 --> 00:14:11.700
<v Speaker 1>and I'm going so much into my,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're going into the weeds,</v>

220
00:14:12.020 --> 00:14:13.040
<v Speaker 1>but that's good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's good.</v>

221
00:14:13.041 --> 00:14:13.874
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if I can say there is no term hate </v>

222
00:14:16.940 --> 00:14:17.773
<v Speaker 1>speech and that was the point that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>made in your University of New </v>

223
00:14:21.060 --> 00:14:23.470
<v Speaker 1>Hampshire.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not have said that it's a fact.</v>

224
00:14:23.480 --> 00:14:27.140
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's a fact that is subscribed to by</v>

225
00:14:27.350 --> 00:14:31.970
<v Speaker 1>every single supreme court justice </v>
<v Speaker 1>across the ideological spectrum.</v>

226
00:14:31.971 --> 00:14:32.804
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>from Ginsburg and Sotomayor on the left </v>

227
00:14:34.581 --> 00:14:37.760
<v Speaker 1>to Alito and gorsuch and Scalia.</v>
<v Speaker 1>On the right,</v>

228
00:14:37.761 --> 00:14:38.594
<v Speaker 1>and I think that's a very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very important point that for all of </v>

229
00:14:41.331 --> 00:14:46.331
<v Speaker 1>their ideological differences on so many</v>
<v Speaker 1>issues that so many justices,</v>

230
00:14:47.421 --> 00:14:48.254
<v Speaker 1>every justice in modern history has </v>
<v Speaker 1>subscribed to this principal and I wish </v>

231
00:14:52.971 --> 00:14:57.971
<v Speaker 1>that people across the ideological </v>
<v Speaker 1>spectrum in other branches of government</v>

232
00:14:58.221 --> 00:15:02.660
<v Speaker 1>and the general public which share that </v>
<v Speaker 1>unanimity because no matter who you are,</v>

233
00:15:02.661 --> 00:15:03.494
<v Speaker 1>no matter what you believe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you really have a stake in denying the </v>

234
00:15:06.801 --> 00:15:11.801
<v Speaker 1>government and the majority of of people</v>
<v Speaker 1>that wield power taken away from you.</v>

235
00:15:12.980 --> 00:15:17.240
<v Speaker 1>The choice about which views you will </v>
<v Speaker 1>express or listened to or refute.</v>

236
00:15:17.330 --> 00:15:21.800
<v Speaker 1>So in that University of New Hampshire </v>
<v Speaker 1>speech that I know you watched when,</v>

237
00:15:22.280 --> 00:15:23.360
<v Speaker 1>when I was saying there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

238
00:15:23.440 --> 00:15:26.000
<v Speaker 1>hate speech is not real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Obviously.</v>

239
00:15:26.001 --> 00:15:28.940
<v Speaker 1>I was making the distinction between the</v>
<v Speaker 1>direct call to violence,</v>

240
00:15:28.941 --> 00:15:31.130
<v Speaker 1>which I actually said unless it's a </v>
<v Speaker 1>direct call to bounce,</v>

241
00:15:31.131 --> 00:15:34.250
<v Speaker 1>but hate speech in and of itself is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is nothing.</v>

242
00:15:34.251 --> 00:15:35.084
<v Speaker 1>It's not a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not a thing you can say mean </v>

243
00:15:36.981 --> 00:15:38.660
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would prefer you don't.</v>

244
00:15:39.350 --> 00:15:42.500
<v Speaker 1>We wish we could all be nice to each </v>
<v Speaker 1>other and say lovely things.</v>

245
00:15:42.501 --> 00:15:43.334
<v Speaker 1>They use pronouns.</v>
<v Speaker 1>At the way people want it and all of </v>

246
00:15:44.951 --> 00:15:45.784
<v Speaker 1>those things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you can't have the government doing </v>

247
00:15:46.791 --> 00:15:47.624
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is there anything else that I should </v>

248
00:15:49.001 --> 00:15:49.834
<v Speaker 1>have added that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that perhaps could have gotten those </v>

249
00:15:52.821 --> 00:15:54.670
<v Speaker 1>young people to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

250
00:15:54.720 --> 00:15:58.040
<v Speaker 1>listen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that they were disposed not to listen,</v>

251
00:15:58.041 --> 00:15:58.874
<v Speaker 1>but for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there were obviously some openminded </v>

252
00:16:00.260 --> 00:16:01.220
<v Speaker 1>people in the audience.</v>

253
00:16:01.220 --> 00:16:02.630
<v Speaker 1>And those are the ones that you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

254
00:16:02.631 --> 00:16:03.880
<v Speaker 1>the hecklers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think we're,</v>

255
00:16:04.100 --> 00:16:04.933
<v Speaker 1>we're not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they didn't seem genuinely interested </v>

256
00:16:06.981 --> 00:16:08.180
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in hearing you out,</v>

257
00:16:08.181 --> 00:16:11.630
<v Speaker 1>but many other people there did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the other point that,</v>

258
00:16:11.860 --> 00:16:15.050
<v Speaker 1>that I would make strategically,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dave and I already did it,</v>

259
00:16:15.051 --> 00:16:19.750
<v Speaker 1>and pointing out the Martin Luther King </v>
<v Speaker 1>counterpart to the Nazis is I always try</v>

260
00:16:19.751 --> 00:16:24.751
<v Speaker 1>to give an example.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're an idea that you happen to support</v>

261
00:16:25.120 --> 00:16:25.953
<v Speaker 1>the person I'm talking to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It really supports would be threatened </v>

262
00:16:28.550 --> 00:16:31.040
<v Speaker 1>if we gave that power to the government.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

263
00:16:31.320 --> 00:16:32.153
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for that,</v>

264
00:16:32.370 --> 00:16:35.570
<v Speaker 1>that audience where you had people </v>
<v Speaker 1>chanting black lives matter,</v>

265
00:16:35.810 --> 00:16:36.643
<v Speaker 1>I would have pointed out how many </v>
<v Speaker 1>government officials now are saying </v>

266
00:16:40.821 --> 00:16:45.821
<v Speaker 1>black lives matter advocacy should be </v>
<v Speaker 1>treated as hate speech.</v>

267
00:16:47.080 --> 00:16:52.080
<v Speaker 1>That even saying that black lives matter</v>
<v Speaker 1>should be treated as a hate group,</v>

268
00:16:52.790 --> 00:16:53.623
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the southern poverty law center which </v>

269
00:16:54.951 --> 00:16:59.951
<v Speaker 1>monitors hate groups has been lobbied to</v>
<v Speaker 1>treat black lives matter as such.</v>

270
00:17:00.350 --> 00:17:01.183
<v Speaker 1>And so then you had to say to people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to understand that it's not </v>

271
00:17:04.791 --> 00:17:05.624
<v Speaker 1>your values that are going to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>implemented by the enforcing officials </v>

272
00:17:09.471 --> 00:17:12.620
<v Speaker 1>across the country.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if we have this loose,</v>

273
00:17:12.621 --> 00:17:13.454
<v Speaker 1>nebulous concept,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean hate is an emotion that's </v>

274
00:17:16.611 --> 00:17:20.570
<v Speaker 1>inherently subjective.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What one person considers hateful,</v>

275
00:17:20.720 --> 00:17:21.553
<v Speaker 1>somebody else cherishes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you mentioned the southern poverty </v>

276
00:17:24.831 --> 00:17:27.230
<v Speaker 1>law center.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to get you in any hot water</v>

277
00:17:27.231 --> 00:17:28.970
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they to me,</v>

278
00:17:28.971 --> 00:17:31.880
<v Speaker 1>strike me as an organization that has </v>
<v Speaker 1>completely,</v>

279
00:17:32.600 --> 00:17:36.320
<v Speaker 1>completely with almost no reservation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Can I say this,</v>

280
00:17:36.590 --> 00:17:38.510
<v Speaker 1>gone off the rails,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but are they have,</v>

281
00:17:38.540 --> 00:17:39.980
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>between now they just,</v>

282
00:17:40.190 --> 00:17:41.460
<v Speaker 1>just in this last week,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

283
00:17:41.461 --> 00:17:42.294
<v Speaker 1>they lost this lawsuit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Marginalized is getting a three point </v>

284
00:17:44.181 --> 00:17:45.590
<v Speaker 1>$3,000,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>settlement.</v>

285
00:17:45.591 --> 00:17:48.590
<v Speaker 1>But they had Ayaan Hirsi Ali and </v>
<v Speaker 1>Bridgette Gabriel.</v>

286
00:17:48.591 --> 00:17:50.010
<v Speaker 1>And several other people who I've had</v>

287
00:17:50.010 --> 00:17:52.620
<v Speaker 2>on the show who I think are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>are wonderful people,</v>

288
00:17:52.810 --> 00:17:54.040
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>on their hate lists.</v>

289
00:17:54.041 --> 00:17:54.874
<v Speaker 2>They just put up an article about the </v>
<v Speaker 2>evils of prager university and and </v>

290
00:17:58.710 --> 00:17:59.543
<v Speaker 2>called me out by name.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What am I to make of the shifting of </v>

291
00:18:03.330 --> 00:18:04.163
<v Speaker 2>traditionally organizations that were </v>
<v Speaker 2>doing good work into becoming what I </v>

292
00:18:07.801 --> 00:18:08.634
<v Speaker 2>would say are really far left advocacy </v>
<v Speaker 2>groups instead of maybe the original </v>

293
00:18:12.481 --> 00:18:13.720
<v Speaker 2>mission statement.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Would you.</v>

294
00:18:13.890 --> 00:18:14.723
<v Speaker 1>I think that was a fair assessment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just not knowledgeable enough about the </v>

295
00:18:17.251 --> 00:18:18.084
<v Speaker 1>instances that you site.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I'll go back to something I said at </v>

296
00:18:20.491 --> 00:18:21.324
<v Speaker 1>the beginning,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is I don't endorse or criticize </v>

297
00:18:24.300 --> 00:18:25.133
<v Speaker 1>any organization across the board.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I look at it issue by issue and I think </v>

298
00:18:29.810 --> 00:18:34.810
<v Speaker 1>the southern poverty law center has done</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of good work on issues that,</v>

299
00:18:35.230 --> 00:18:39.690
<v Speaker 1>that I care about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>including a freedom of speech on campus.</v>

300
00:18:39.691 --> 00:18:43.890
<v Speaker 1>And they definitely oppose censorship </v>
<v Speaker 1>are including of hate speech.</v>

301
00:18:43.891 --> 00:18:46.980
<v Speaker 1>I testified with a leader of the SPLC,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

302
00:18:46.981 --> 00:18:47.814
<v Speaker 1>before a congress last year and </v>
<v Speaker 1>completely opposed to censorship </v>

303
00:18:52.320 --> 00:18:55.410
<v Speaker 1>completely supporting counter speech.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And in fact,</v>

304
00:18:55.411 --> 00:19:00.411
<v Speaker 1>the SPLC put out a wonderful guide for </v>
<v Speaker 1>college students at the beginning of the</v>

305
00:19:00.570 --> 00:19:01.403
<v Speaker 1>last academic year,</v>
<v Speaker 1>urging them when a white supremacists </v>

306
00:19:07.391 --> 00:19:12.180
<v Speaker 1>recruiters are coming to campus not to </v>
<v Speaker 1>engage in disruption,</v>

307
00:19:12.390 --> 00:19:15.510
<v Speaker 1>not try to censor them or to shout them </v>
<v Speaker 1>down,</v>

308
00:19:15.690 --> 00:19:18.630
<v Speaker 1>but to ignore them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I thought that was right,</v>

309
00:19:18.631 --> 00:19:22.830
<v Speaker 1>not only in principle,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but also as a matter of strategy because</v>

310
00:19:22.831 --> 00:19:26.160
<v Speaker 1>you're just playing into their tactics.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

311
00:19:26.310 --> 00:19:28.520
<v Speaker 1>does that mean that every single thing </v>
<v Speaker 1>they've done is,</v>

312
00:19:28.521 --> 00:19:29.730
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is praiseworthy?</v>

313
00:19:29.731 --> 00:19:34.180
<v Speaker 1>I doubted I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think even the Hclu is not a above.</v>

314
00:19:34.181 --> 00:19:34.250
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

315
00:19:34.250 --> 00:19:37.130
<v Speaker 2>criticism.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I know when,</v>

316
00:19:37.160 --> 00:19:39.950
<v Speaker 2>when they sent over some notes about </v>
<v Speaker 2>what we,</v>

317
00:19:40.010 --> 00:19:42.710
<v Speaker 2>what we potentially could talk about </v>
<v Speaker 2>your book and everything else.</v>

318
00:19:43.030 --> 00:19:46.310
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so because you did watch that University</v>

319
00:19:46.310 --> 00:19:47.143
<v Speaker 2>of New Hampshire thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a moment where a girl that was </v>

320
00:19:48.741 --> 00:19:51.830
<v Speaker 2>challenged me kept implying that it was </v>
<v Speaker 2>free speech,</v>

321
00:19:51.831 --> 00:19:54.760
<v Speaker 2>sort of that led to the Holocaust,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that it was this,</v>

322
00:19:54.860 --> 00:19:56.960
<v Speaker 2>that we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they allowed incitement.</v>

323
00:19:56.961 --> 00:19:58.640
<v Speaker 2>And that that's what led to it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>

324
00:19:58.641 --> 00:20:01.580
<v Speaker 2>my basic argument was the more speech </v>
<v Speaker 2>there is,</v>

325
00:20:01.581 --> 00:20:05.360
<v Speaker 2>the more we can allow sunlight to </v>
<v Speaker 2>disinfect bad ideas.</v>

326
00:20:05.630 --> 00:20:08.600
<v Speaker 2>But I think perhaps I could have been a </v>
<v Speaker 2>little more forceful there.</v>

327
00:20:08.601 --> 00:20:10.940
<v Speaker 2>If you were standing next to me when we </v>
<v Speaker 2>were doing this,</v>

328
00:20:11.150 --> 00:20:11.983
<v Speaker 2>what would you have been saying in my </v>
<v Speaker 2>ear to that argument that if we just </v>

329
00:20:14.571 --> 00:20:15.404
<v Speaker 2>keep letting people say all these awful </v>
<v Speaker 2>things that it can lead to awful things </v>

330
00:20:18.381 --> 00:20:21.220
<v Speaker 2>and awful things obviously have happened</v>
<v Speaker 2>throughout the course of your years.</v>

331
00:20:21.380 --> 00:20:22.213
<v Speaker 1>I have a lot of answers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but let me start with the one that is </v>

332
00:20:24.171 --> 00:20:27.500
<v Speaker 1>most specific to the Holocaust.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And again,</v>

333
00:20:27.501 --> 00:20:28.334
<v Speaker 1>I have a personal stake and I know you </v>
<v Speaker 1>also lost relatives in the Holocaust </v>

334
00:20:32.360 --> 00:20:32.871
<v Speaker 1>offer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Me.</v>

335
00:20:32.871 --> 00:20:33.704
<v Speaker 1>My father fortunately survived,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he was in a concentration camp and </v>

336
00:20:36.471 --> 00:20:37.304
<v Speaker 1>suffered grievously doing forced labor </v>
<v Speaker 1>and in fact was scheduled to be </v>

337
00:20:42.530 --> 00:20:47.530
<v Speaker 1>sterilized and then was liberated by the</v>
<v Speaker 1>US one day before.</v>

338
00:20:49.541 --> 00:20:50.860
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

339
00:20:50.861 --> 00:20:53.770
<v Speaker 1>I almost had my life exterminated before</v>
<v Speaker 1>it began.</v>

340
00:20:53.771 --> 00:20:57.040
<v Speaker 1>I have no love lost for the Nazis are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

341
00:20:57.100 --> 00:20:57.933
<v Speaker 1>there was a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there were hate speech laws in the </v>

342
00:21:03.190 --> 00:21:03.850
<v Speaker 1>Weimar Republic during,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>

343
00:21:03.850 --> 00:21:04.683
<v Speaker 1>which is in Germany,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where Hitler rose to power and the hate </v>

344
00:21:08.561 --> 00:21:09.394
<v Speaker 1>speech laws were very similar to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>ones that exist in Germany and other </v>

345
00:21:12.731 --> 00:21:16.360
<v Speaker 1>countries today.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They were very strictly enforced.</v>

346
00:21:16.600 --> 00:21:20.830
<v Speaker 1>Nazis were prosecuted and convicted </v>
<v Speaker 1>repeatedly.</v>

347
00:21:21.070 --> 00:21:22.330
<v Speaker 1>And guess what?</v>

348
00:21:22.420 --> 00:21:27.420
<v Speaker 1>They laughed at.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was a huge propaganda opportunity for</v>

349
00:21:27.461 --> 00:21:28.294
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They gained attention and support that </v>

350
00:21:30.701 --> 00:21:35.290
<v Speaker 1>they otherwise never would have had,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just like the Neo Nazis in skokie.</v>

351
00:21:35.291 --> 00:21:36.124
<v Speaker 1>All those years later,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nobody would have heard of them if we </v>

352
00:21:38.650 --> 00:21:39.483
<v Speaker 1>adjust,</v>
<v Speaker 1>allowed them to have their miserable </v>

353
00:21:41.501 --> 00:21:46.210
<v Speaker 1>little march for the 20 minutes to 30 </v>
<v Speaker 1>minutes they were seeking to March.</v>

354
00:21:46.390 --> 00:21:47.223
<v Speaker 1>Instead,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it becomes two years worth of worldwide </v>

355
00:21:48.701 --> 00:21:49.720
<v Speaker 1>attention.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

356
00:21:49.721 --> 00:21:54.721
<v Speaker 1>the problem in Nazi in Pre Nazi Germany </v>
<v Speaker 1>was that there was no protection against</v>

357
00:21:55.960 --> 00:22:00.130
<v Speaker 1>violence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that the Nazis were engaging in a.</v>

358
00:22:00.131 --> 00:22:01.230
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

359
00:22:01.270 --> 00:22:02.103
<v Speaker 1>their political opponents as well as </v>
<v Speaker 1>Jews and others were subject literally </v>

360
00:22:05.501 --> 00:22:06.334
<v Speaker 1>to physical assaults and even murder </v>
<v Speaker 1>without any sufficient protection or </v>

361
00:22:11.171 --> 00:22:15.430
<v Speaker 1>punishment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the other point I would make is that,</v>

362
00:22:15.640 --> 00:22:16.473
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those of us who are minorities and Jews </v>

363
00:22:19.691 --> 00:22:23.170
<v Speaker 1>are a tiny minority in this country and </v>
<v Speaker 1>around the world,</v>

364
00:22:23.580 --> 00:22:24.413
<v Speaker 1>especially depend on freedom of speech </v>
<v Speaker 1>because by definition we're never going </v>

365
00:22:29.511 --> 00:22:31.960
<v Speaker 1>to have majority power.</v>

366
00:22:32.170 --> 00:22:33.003
<v Speaker 1>So all we have to depend on a to limit </v>
<v Speaker 1>the majority from trampling on our </v>

367
00:22:39.041 --> 00:22:39.874
<v Speaker 1>rights is freedom of speech to protest </v>
<v Speaker 1>the First Amendment Right of </v>

368
00:22:44.081 --> 00:22:45.820
<v Speaker 1>association,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

369
00:22:45.821 --> 00:22:49.690
<v Speaker 1>to the right to petition the government </v>
<v Speaker 1>for redress of grievances.</v>

370
00:22:49.960 --> 00:22:53.430
<v Speaker 1>Are Jonathan routes should great gay </v>
<v Speaker 1>rights advocate who my quota,</v>

371
00:22:53.440 --> 00:22:58.090
<v Speaker 1>my work makes the same point about Noah </v>
<v Speaker 1>as a member of sexual orientation.</v>

372
00:22:58.120 --> 00:23:01.540
<v Speaker 1>Minority.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All minorities especially depend on free</v>

373
00:23:01.541 --> 00:23:02.540
<v Speaker 1>speech.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

374
00:23:02.550 --> 00:23:06.880
<v Speaker 1>I quote all a lot of civil rights </v>
<v Speaker 1>leaders in my book,</v>

375
00:23:06.940 --> 00:23:09.700
<v Speaker 1>Martin Luther King,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Naacp,</v>

376
00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:10.833
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>throughout the civil rights movement </v>

377
00:23:11.891 --> 00:23:12.724
<v Speaker 1>were completely opposed to censorship </v>
<v Speaker 1>including hate speech laws in part </v>

378
00:23:17.171 --> 00:23:18.004
<v Speaker 1>because their speech was viewed as hated</v>
<v Speaker 1>and even hateful and certainly </v>

379
00:23:22.811 --> 00:23:24.900
<v Speaker 1>dangerous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How concerned are you about</v>

380
00:23:25.100 --> 00:23:28.180
<v Speaker 2>self censorship?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not not the government doing it,</v>

381
00:23:28.181 --> 00:23:31.810
<v Speaker 2>but what I see more as the sort of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>low level war right now,</v>

382
00:23:31.811 --> 00:23:32.644
<v Speaker 2>which is just the emails that I get </v>
<v Speaker 2>every day about people afraid to speak </v>

383
00:23:35.921 --> 00:23:36.754
<v Speaker 2>up at work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People are afraid to speak up at </v>

384
00:23:37.871 --> 00:23:38.704
<v Speaker 2>college.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People literally afraid to speak up in </v>

385
00:23:40.361 --> 00:23:44.260
<v Speaker 2>their own homes because they've been so </v>
<v Speaker 2>crushed by political correctness.</v>

386
00:23:44.261 --> 00:23:45.890
<v Speaker 2>They don't want to start fights with </v>
<v Speaker 2>loved ones.</v>

387
00:23:46.100 --> 00:23:49.580
<v Speaker 1>It's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a serious problem and I have to say</v>

388
00:23:49.581 --> 00:23:54.581
<v Speaker 1>it's a difficult problem because to some</v>
<v Speaker 1>extent the point of counter speech,</v>

389
00:23:56.031 --> 00:23:56.864
<v Speaker 1>which I advocated by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a legalistic way of saying </v>

390
00:24:00.650 --> 00:24:01.483
<v Speaker 1>anything you disagree with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you just rate rather than trying to </v>

391
00:24:04.161 --> 00:24:04.994
<v Speaker 1>squelch it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>stopping that expression from coming </v>

392
00:24:07.221 --> 00:24:09.020
<v Speaker 1>out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You respond to it,</v>

393
00:24:09.200 --> 00:24:12.140
<v Speaker 1>you debate it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you try to persuade you could Joel,</v>

394
00:24:12.200 --> 00:24:15.290
<v Speaker 1>so that's countering an idea you </v>
<v Speaker 1>disliked with your own speech.</v>

395
00:24:15.770 --> 00:24:16.603
<v Speaker 1>To some extent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the goal of counter speech is to chill </v>

396
00:24:20.660 --> 00:24:24.200
<v Speaker 1>certain speech and certain ideas,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

397
00:24:24.350 --> 00:24:29.350
<v Speaker 1>You want to dissuade somebody from </v>
<v Speaker 1>adhering to white supremacist views.</v>

398
00:24:29.721 --> 00:24:32.870
<v Speaker 1>You don't see it as bad if they self </v>
<v Speaker 1>sensor,</v>

399
00:24:32.930 --> 00:24:33.763
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but when does that persuasion cross the </v>

400
00:24:37.671 --> 00:24:38.504
<v Speaker 1>line into bullying or Harrison?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that's a very important and </v>

401
00:24:43.761 --> 00:24:44.594
<v Speaker 1>difficult issue,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which was discussed very extensively in </v>

402
00:24:49.550 --> 00:24:53.210
<v Speaker 1>the famous John Stuart Mill Essay on </v>
<v Speaker 1>liberty,</v>

403
00:24:53.530 --> 00:24:55.820
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>many people who haven't recently read it</v>

404
00:24:55.821 --> 00:24:56.654
<v Speaker 1>wouldn't be surprised as I was because I</v>
<v Speaker 1>hadn't read it for a few years and keep </v>

405
00:25:00.021 --> 00:25:01.490
<v Speaker 1>a copy of it with me on my travels.</v>

406
00:25:01.490 --> 00:25:06.490
<v Speaker 1>And somebody reminded me that his main </v>
<v Speaker 1>focus there was not on direct government</v>

407
00:25:08.181 --> 00:25:09.014
<v Speaker 1>coercion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but rather on the social pressure that </v>

408
00:25:13.071 --> 00:25:16.070
<v Speaker 1>is exerted by colleagues,</v>
<v Speaker 1>peers,</v>

409
00:25:16.160 --> 00:25:19.040
<v Speaker 1>civil society,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and in this country.</v>

410
00:25:19.041 --> 00:25:19.874
<v Speaker 1>On the one hand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm very glad that there is such a </v>

411
00:25:22.190 --> 00:25:23.023
<v Speaker 1>robust civil society,</v>
<v Speaker 1>condemnation of racist tweets by </v>

412
00:25:28.011 --> 00:25:31.760
<v Speaker 1>Roseanne Barr to cite a fairly recent </v>
<v Speaker 1>example.</v>

413
00:25:31.850 --> 00:25:32.683
<v Speaker 1>On the other hand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm afraid of the mob ruthlessly </v>

414
00:25:38.480 --> 00:25:43.480
<v Speaker 1>punishing somebody who may have just </v>
<v Speaker 1>said something that's insensitive.</v>

415
00:25:44.390 --> 00:25:45.570
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

416
00:25:45.630 --> 00:25:46.130
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

417
00:25:46.130 --> 00:25:48.110
<v Speaker 1>and I'm concerned about that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>David.</v>

418
00:25:48.111 --> 00:25:51.510
<v Speaker 1>Not only because I don't want to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

419
00:25:51.740 --> 00:25:52.573
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the mob is no more appealing as a force </v>

420
00:25:56.361 --> 00:26:01.361
<v Speaker 1>that drives certain ideas out of </v>
<v Speaker 1>existence than the government is,</v>

421
00:26:01.880 --> 00:26:06.880
<v Speaker 1>but I'm also concerned from the point of</v>
<v Speaker 1>view of educating and persuading and you</v>

422
00:26:10.721 --> 00:26:11.554
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've met people that have been not only </v>

423
00:26:14.751 --> 00:26:18.920
<v Speaker 1>members,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but leaders of hate groups who have come</v>

424
00:26:18.921 --> 00:26:19.754
<v Speaker 1>to see that they were wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who have come to realize that all of us </v>

425
00:26:26.121 --> 00:26:26.954
<v Speaker 1>are equal and entitled to equal dignity </v>
<v Speaker 1>and equal rights and they've repudiated </v>

426
00:26:31.971 --> 00:26:36.971
<v Speaker 1>their formerly discriminatory ideas and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they didn't come to that change by being</v>

427
00:26:38.631 --> 00:26:39.464
<v Speaker 1>denounced as racists,</v>
<v Speaker 1>much less as what happened in Europe by </v>

428
00:26:43.080 --> 00:26:45.690
<v Speaker 1>being imprisoned as,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as racist.</v>

429
00:26:45.870 --> 00:26:46.703
<v Speaker 1>So if our goal truly is to gain more </v>
<v Speaker 1>support on the part of more people for </v>

430
00:26:52.201 --> 00:26:53.034
<v Speaker 1>the ideals of liberty and justice and </v>
<v Speaker 1>human rights and equality and dignity </v>

431
00:26:56.581 --> 00:26:59.740
<v Speaker 1>for all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think we don't do it by,</v>

432
00:26:59.800 --> 00:27:00.633
<v Speaker 1>by shouting them down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's a strategic question as well as </v>

433
00:27:04.351 --> 00:27:06.210
<v Speaker 1>a PR.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A principled question.</v>

434
00:27:06.320 --> 00:27:07.153
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is that just one of those things where </v>

435
00:27:08.001 --> 00:27:12.440
<v Speaker 2>it's like in the moment that we live in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we often don't live up to our ideals and</v>

436
00:27:12.441 --> 00:27:13.274
<v Speaker 2>the best way possible because you </v>
<v Speaker 2>referenced being constitutional law </v>

437
00:27:15.261 --> 00:27:16.094
<v Speaker 2>professor and I've got the declaration </v>
<v Speaker 2>of independence and the constitution </v>

438
00:27:19.251 --> 00:27:22.550
<v Speaker 2>framed right in that room right over </v>
<v Speaker 2>there and it's like these guys that were</v>

439
00:27:22.551 --> 00:27:23.384
<v Speaker 2>writing these incredible documents that </v>
<v Speaker 2>have given more freedom to more people </v>

440
00:27:26.150 --> 00:27:28.710
<v Speaker 2>than in the history of the world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

441
00:27:28.711 --> 00:27:29.544
<v Speaker 2>some of them were slave owners and and </v>
<v Speaker 2>plenty of other things and probably </v>

442
00:27:32.121 --> 00:27:32.954
<v Speaker 2>womanizers and whatever and it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but yet they were writing the things </v>

443
00:27:36.381 --> 00:27:39.080
<v Speaker 2>that freed us,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is an incredible and that's just a</v>

444
00:27:39.081 --> 00:27:40.250
<v Speaker 2>little something about being human.</v>

445
00:27:40.250 --> 00:27:41.083
<v Speaker 1>Nice book and I think it ties back to </v>
<v Speaker 1>some of our earlier conversation that </v>

446
00:27:44.900 --> 00:27:45.733
<v Speaker 1>I'm so much of what passes as debate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>such as your hecklers at the University </v>

447
00:27:53.510 --> 00:27:54.343
<v Speaker 1>of New Hampshire is not genuinely </v>
<v Speaker 1>engaged in really trying to relate to </v>

448
00:27:59.991 --> 00:28:04.010
<v Speaker 1>you as a full fledged human being with </v>
<v Speaker 1>whom they might.</v>

449
00:28:04.160 --> 00:28:04.993
<v Speaker 1>I have absolutely no doubt based on my </v>
<v Speaker 1>experience that there are no two people </v>

450
00:28:09.561 --> 00:28:14.561
<v Speaker 1>in the world who won't have at least </v>
<v Speaker 1>some strong common concern,</v>

451
00:28:15.800 --> 00:28:20.630
<v Speaker 1>some idea that they passion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that they both deeply care about and are</v>

452
00:28:20.631 --> 00:28:21.464
<v Speaker 1>committed to and and some that they </v>
<v Speaker 1>deeply disagree about and I think it's </v>

453
00:28:26.090 --> 00:28:28.610
<v Speaker 1>really important not to paper over the </v>
<v Speaker 1>disagreements.</v>

454
00:28:28.611 --> 00:28:31.460
<v Speaker 1>I think we should discuss them and hash </v>
<v Speaker 1>them out,</v>

455
00:28:31.700 --> 00:28:32.533
<v Speaker 1>but I think we can do that more </v>
<v Speaker 1>constructively and effectively if we </v>

456
00:28:35.871 --> 00:28:40.480
<v Speaker 1>also find what we have in common and </v>
<v Speaker 1>relate to each other in,</v>

457
00:28:40.490 --> 00:28:41.990
<v Speaker 1>in a holistic way.</v>

458
00:28:42.200 --> 00:28:45.320
<v Speaker 2>Alright.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there does seem to me to be a rebirth</v>

459
00:28:45.800 --> 00:28:49.790
<v Speaker 2>of a defense of free speech starting </v>
<v Speaker 2>again on the left possibly.</v>

460
00:28:49.970 --> 00:28:51.500
<v Speaker 2>I see a little southern happening.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I did.</v>

461
00:28:51.501 --> 00:28:52.334
<v Speaker 2>Jonathan hated heterodox and some of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>other organizations you're involved in </v>

462
00:28:54.921 --> 00:28:55.754
<v Speaker 2>in fire.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There is this group of people kind of </v>

463
00:28:58.280 --> 00:29:01.790
<v Speaker 2>making a comeback on the left.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not so sure it can hold,</v>

464
00:29:01.880 --> 00:29:05.420
<v Speaker 2>I hope it can hold,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but what do you make of how this sort of</v>

465
00:29:05.870 --> 00:29:06.703
<v Speaker 2>bounces back where sometimes free speech</v>
<v Speaker 2>is something that the left holds more </v>

466
00:29:09.471 --> 00:29:10.304
<v Speaker 2>deer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes it's finding the right holds </v>

467
00:29:10.941 --> 00:29:14.340
<v Speaker 2>more deer and it kind of switches as the</v>
<v Speaker 2>decades go ahead</v>

468
00:29:14.530 --> 00:29:18.220
<v Speaker 1>from my perspective,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I'm not far be it for me to pull out</v>

469
00:29:18.221 --> 00:29:19.054
<v Speaker 1>the age card,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think a few more decades than you </v>

470
00:29:21.431 --> 00:29:22.264
<v Speaker 1>have and and it's been a constant that </v>
<v Speaker 1>was very well summed up by nat handoff </v>

471
00:29:27.740 --> 00:29:28.600
<v Speaker 1>home.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You would have loved,</v>

472
00:29:28.601 --> 00:29:30.370
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if you ever crossed paths </v>
<v Speaker 1>with him,</v>

473
00:29:31.030 --> 00:29:31.863
<v Speaker 1>but he was a great free speech stalwart </v>
<v Speaker 1>and he wrote a book whose title really </v>

474
00:29:35.771 --> 00:29:39.430
<v Speaker 1>says it all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>freedom of speech for me,</v>

475
00:29:39.610 --> 00:29:40.443
<v Speaker 1>but not for me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how the left and right relentlessly </v>

476
00:29:44.291 --> 00:29:47.050
<v Speaker 1>sensor each other and he wrote that </v>
<v Speaker 1>decades ago,</v>

477
00:29:47.350 --> 00:29:52.350
<v Speaker 1>but it's always been true that most </v>
<v Speaker 1>people being ill man,</v>

478
00:29:53.620 --> 00:29:54.453
<v Speaker 1>believe in free speech in general,</v>
<v Speaker 1>thought those ideas that they hate or </v>

479
00:29:59.381 --> 00:30:02.050
<v Speaker 1>despise or think are dangerous should be</v>
<v Speaker 1>the exception.</v>

480
00:30:02.051 --> 00:30:05.770
<v Speaker 1>Let's go back to skokie where a clu </v>
<v Speaker 1>members,</v>

481
00:30:05.830 --> 00:30:10.480
<v Speaker 1>even 15 percent of these die hard </v>
<v Speaker 1>stalwart clu members.</v>

482
00:30:10.480 --> 00:30:14.470
<v Speaker 1>I'm not surprised that the one exception</v>
<v Speaker 1>they want to make is for speech.</v>

483
00:30:14.471 --> 00:30:17.920
<v Speaker 1>That's Dan grading,</v>
<v Speaker 1>civil liberties and human rights,</v>

484
00:30:17.921 --> 00:30:18.754
<v Speaker 1>but I had a friend who was the executive</v>
<v Speaker 1>director of the National Coalition </v>

485
00:30:22.840 --> 00:30:24.310
<v Speaker 1>Against Censorship and she put it so </v>
<v Speaker 1>well.</v>

486
00:30:24.311 --> 00:30:29.311
<v Speaker 1>She said Nadine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everyone has his or her skokie.</v>

487
00:30:30.130 --> 00:30:30.963
<v Speaker 1>So at particular times I can tell you </v>
<v Speaker 1>for every year I can tell you this was </v>

488
00:30:36.160 --> 00:30:40.600
<v Speaker 1>the one exception or maybe more than one</v>
<v Speaker 1>exception that liberals want to make and</v>

489
00:30:40.601 --> 00:30:42.910
<v Speaker 1>this is the one that conservatives </v>
<v Speaker 1>wanted to make.</v>

490
00:30:43.080 --> 00:30:45.370
<v Speaker 1>And I would say in general,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

491
00:30:45.371 --> 00:30:46.204
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

492
00:30:46.360 --> 00:30:47.193
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's amend the constitution so that it </v>

493
00:30:50.021 --> 00:30:55.021
<v Speaker 1>is a crime to burn the American flag </v>
<v Speaker 1>that has been supported by many,</v>

494
00:30:57.161 --> 00:31:01.510
<v Speaker 1>if not most conservatives and by a lot </v>
<v Speaker 1>of liberals as well.</v>

495
00:31:02.080 --> 00:31:03.610
<v Speaker 1>That.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there's not been,</v>

496
00:31:03.850 --> 00:31:04.683
<v Speaker 1>I think that is the single most hated </v>
<v Speaker 1>expression in my lifetime because no </v>

497
00:31:09.731 --> 00:31:14.731
<v Speaker 1>other expression has led to a </v>
<v Speaker 1>constitutional amendment coming within a</v>

498
00:31:15.131 --> 00:31:20.131
<v Speaker 1>hair's breadth of being ratified more </v>
<v Speaker 1>than two thirds of the Senate.</v>

499
00:31:20.800 --> 00:31:21.633
<v Speaker 1>I'm sorry if the House approved,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it came within one vote short of two </v>

500
00:31:25.361 --> 00:31:28.600
<v Speaker 1>thirds of the Senate and more than three</v>
<v Speaker 1>fourths of the states.</v>

501
00:31:28.840 --> 00:31:29.570
<v Speaker 1>So all of it.</v>

502
00:31:29.570 --> 00:31:32.220
<v Speaker 2>That's when was that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe that was mid nineties.</v>

503
00:31:32.240 --> 00:31:33.930
<v Speaker 2>Maybe something around there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

504
00:31:33.990 --> 00:31:35.910
<v Speaker 2>That's incredible actually,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you think about it.</v>

505
00:31:36.400 --> 00:31:37.190
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Where,</v>

506
00:31:37.190 --> 00:31:41.070
<v Speaker 2>where do you think trump kind of fits </v>
<v Speaker 2>into the general discussion?</v>

507
00:31:41.080 --> 00:31:41.913
<v Speaker 2>Because he loved.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It seems to me that there is obviously </v>

508
00:31:43.891 --> 00:31:48.720
<v Speaker 2>some sort of authoritarian bent to him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That being said,</v>

509
00:31:48.750 --> 00:31:49.770
<v Speaker 2>we're not being.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People are,</v>

510
00:31:49.771 --> 00:31:53.610
<v Speaker 2>as far as I know people are being jailed</v>
<v Speaker 2>because of free speech at the moment.</v>

511
00:31:54.090 --> 00:31:57.920
<v Speaker 2>Do you think our institutions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's say that his worst critics,</v>

512
00:31:58.590 --> 00:32:00.480
<v Speaker 2>we're write about whatever they think </v>
<v Speaker 2>about him.</v>

513
00:32:00.750 --> 00:32:04.740
<v Speaker 2>Do you think our institutions at this </v>
<v Speaker 2>point are strong enough to ward off that</v>

514
00:32:04.741 --> 00:32:07.620
<v Speaker 2>kind of threat and we don't even have to</v>
<v Speaker 2>make it about trump specifically,</v>

515
00:32:07.621 --> 00:32:11.340
<v Speaker 2>but if there was truly like a real </v>
<v Speaker 2>authoritarian in office,</v>

516
00:32:11.610 --> 00:32:12.443
<v Speaker 2>do you think that the way our balance of</v>
<v Speaker 2>powers and our separation of powers </v>

517
00:32:14.941 --> 00:32:15.530
<v Speaker 2>works,</v>

518
00:32:15.530 --> 00:32:17.010
<v Speaker 1>and again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would have to say,</v>

519
00:32:17.011 --> 00:32:17.844
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>trump has certainly done a lot of saber </v>

520
00:32:20.241 --> 00:32:22.950
<v Speaker 1>rattling on free speech issues and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>

521
00:32:22.970 --> 00:32:25.160
<v Speaker 1>said that flag burners should be </v>
<v Speaker 1>deported.</v>

522
00:32:25.161 --> 00:32:29.270
<v Speaker 1>But let us not forget that Barack Obama </v>
<v Speaker 1>was responsible for,</v>

523
00:32:29.480 --> 00:32:30.313
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the most stringent enforcement of the </v>

524
00:32:32.181 --> 00:32:33.014
<v Speaker 1>espionage act and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pressing criminal charges against more </v>

525
00:32:37.580 --> 00:32:41.450
<v Speaker 1>whistleblowers than all or prior </v>
<v Speaker 1>administrations added together.</v>

526
00:32:41.451 --> 00:32:44.660
<v Speaker 1>So again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a pox on both your houses.</v>

527
00:32:45.510 --> 00:32:46.343
<v Speaker 1>So far,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the courts have been a wonderful </v>

528
00:32:49.500 --> 00:32:50.333
<v Speaker 1>bulwark.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The flag burning example is a really </v>

529
00:32:52.731 --> 00:32:53.564
<v Speaker 1>good one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was a two supreme court decisions </v>

530
00:32:57.020 --> 00:32:57.853
<v Speaker 1>joined by both conservatives and </v>
<v Speaker 1>liberals on the court that struck down </v>

531
00:33:02.720 --> 00:33:03.553
<v Speaker 1>under the First Amendment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>laws that criminalized desecrating the </v>

532
00:33:06.921 --> 00:33:08.450
<v Speaker 1>American flag.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

533
00:33:08.451 --> 00:33:10.970
<v Speaker 1>the Supreme Court doesn't have quite the</v>
<v Speaker 1>last word,</v>

534
00:33:11.120 --> 00:33:13.520
<v Speaker 1>a constitutional amendment could </v>
<v Speaker 1>overturn it,</v>

535
00:33:13.760 --> 00:33:14.593
<v Speaker 1>but I have great confidence that this </v>
<v Speaker 1>court would continue to uphold what has </v>

536
00:33:20.691 --> 00:33:25.691
<v Speaker 1>been called the bedrock principle of </v>
<v Speaker 1>freedom of speech and that his viewpoint</v>

537
00:33:26.061 --> 00:33:28.160
<v Speaker 1>neutrality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I summarized it earlier,</v>

538
00:33:28.161 --> 00:33:31.430
<v Speaker 1>that the mere fact that the viewpoint is</v>
<v Speaker 1>hated,</v>

539
00:33:31.460 --> 00:33:36.140
<v Speaker 1>whether it be flag burning or whether it</v>
<v Speaker 1>be racist speech that has never adjusted</v>

540
00:33:36.141 --> 00:33:36.974
<v Speaker 1>vacation for censorship again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they unanimously endorsed that last </v>

541
00:33:41.090 --> 00:33:42.740
<v Speaker 1>summer in a hate speech case.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

542
00:33:43.020 --> 00:33:44.770
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's slightly shift for a second.</v>

543
00:33:44.771 --> 00:33:45.604
<v Speaker 2>So when you were the head of the Acu,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what are the political pressures that </v>

544
00:33:49.631 --> 00:33:52.720
<v Speaker 2>you're under that maybe the average </v>
<v Speaker 2>person wouldn't know from the,</v>

545
00:33:52.750 --> 00:33:57.080
<v Speaker 2>from the headlines,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like involvement with politicians,</v>

546
00:33:57.090 --> 00:33:58.550
<v Speaker 2>with lobbyists,</v>
<v Speaker 2>etc.</v>

547
00:33:58.600 --> 00:33:59.040
<v Speaker 2>Etc.</v>

548
00:33:59.040 --> 00:33:59.873
<v Speaker 1>So at thE acl you was at his and I was </v>
<v Speaker 1>personally involved in lobbying and </v>

549
00:34:05.851 --> 00:34:06.684
<v Speaker 1>testifying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I still do to testify before congress </v>

550
00:34:08.971 --> 00:34:10.560
<v Speaker 1>occasionally.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

551
00:34:10.561 --> 00:34:11.394
<v Speaker 1>and I would say to me it was a very </v>
<v Speaker 1>privileged position because we did not </v>

552
00:34:16.921 --> 00:34:21.921
<v Speaker 1>have to be directly concerned about </v>
<v Speaker 1>partisan political pressures.</v>

553
00:34:22.440 --> 00:34:23.273
<v Speaker 1>We could Simply make alliances and work </v>
<v Speaker 1>with anybody that we thought could </v>

554
00:34:28.111 --> 00:34:28.944
<v Speaker 1>support an issue that advanced our cars </v>
<v Speaker 1>even if we disagreed with them on other </v>

555
00:34:34.951 --> 00:34:36.210
<v Speaker 1>issues.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I remember,</v>

556
00:34:36.420 --> 00:34:38.970
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to me it was a great source of pleasure.</v>

557
00:34:38.971 --> 00:34:39.804
<v Speaker 1>I remember on one piece of legislation </v>
<v Speaker 1>testifying before the senate judiciary </v>

558
00:34:45.751 --> 00:34:46.584
<v Speaker 1>committee and the chair was orrin hatch </v>
<v Speaker 1>and the ranking a minority minority </v>

559
00:34:51.961 --> 00:34:52.794
<v Speaker 1>member was ted kennedy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they were both supportIng the same </v>

560
00:34:57.001 --> 00:34:57.834
<v Speaker 1>pro civil liberties positions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I was testifying together with the </v>

561
00:35:01.111 --> 00:35:01.944
<v Speaker 1>head of the national association of </v>
<v Speaker 1>evangelicalism and the head of the </v>

562
00:35:06.361 --> 00:35:07.230
<v Speaker 1>mormon church.</v>

563
00:35:07.230 --> 00:35:10.830
<v Speaker 1>And despite all of the differences on so</v>
<v Speaker 1>many other issues,</v>

564
00:35:10.831 --> 00:35:11.664
<v Speaker 1>the fact that we could make common </v>
<v Speaker 1>concern that was on principles of </v>

565
00:35:14.761 --> 00:35:17.640
<v Speaker 1>religious liberty and freedom of thought</v>
<v Speaker 1>and freedom of belief,</v>

566
00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:21.900
<v Speaker 1>that's what I feel is deteriorating a </v>
<v Speaker 1>little bit.</v>

567
00:35:22.320 --> 00:35:23.153
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so last year I testified a couple of </v>

568
00:35:25.381 --> 00:35:26.214
<v Speaker 1>times on campus free speech issues and </v>
<v Speaker 1>the bipartisanship had really worn down </v>

569
00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:36.840
<v Speaker 1>even though the theme was freedom of </v>
<v Speaker 1>speech on.</v>

570
00:35:37.380 --> 00:35:38.213
<v Speaker 1>And even though the chair of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>committee who was lamar alexander </v>

571
00:35:41.040 --> 00:35:44.520
<v Speaker 1>republican and patty murray,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the ranking member democrat,</v>

572
00:35:44.670 --> 00:35:47.370
<v Speaker 1>they were both really solid and great on</v>
<v Speaker 1>the issue,</v>

573
00:35:47.610 --> 00:35:48.443
<v Speaker 1>but the other members of the committee </v>
<v Speaker 1>just used it as opportunities to try it </v>

574
00:35:52.080 --> 00:35:56.490
<v Speaker 1>out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Their own ideas of which free speech was</v>

575
00:35:56.491 --> 00:35:57.324
<v Speaker 1>bad and should be suppressed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So some of the republicans were saying </v>

576
00:36:00.240 --> 00:36:03.180
<v Speaker 1>taking a knee by athletes should be </v>
<v Speaker 1>punished.</v>

577
00:36:03.181 --> 00:36:07.650
<v Speaker 1>And some of the democrats were really </v>
<v Speaker 1>saying trump is violating free speech.</v>

578
00:36:07.650 --> 00:36:10.440
<v Speaker 1>And there was too much political </v>
<v Speaker 1>grandstanding.</v>

579
00:36:10.790 --> 00:36:13.080
<v Speaker 1>And that's why for as critical as I am </v>
<v Speaker 1>for the left,</v>

580
00:36:13.081 --> 00:36:13.914
<v Speaker 1>I don't want free speech to become.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want it to be a political issue </v>

581
00:36:17.071 --> 00:36:19.560
<v Speaker 1>in the first place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want it to be that the right,</v>

582
00:36:19.770 --> 00:36:24.480
<v Speaker 1>which at the moment I see more tolerance</v>
<v Speaker 1>related to diversity of ideas.</v>

583
00:36:24.840 --> 00:36:27.720
<v Speaker 1>I don't want that to be the home.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want there to be a balance.</v>

584
00:36:27.721 --> 00:36:29.610
<v Speaker 1>Otherwise we're just going to end up in </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

585
00:36:30.530 --> 00:36:31.363
<v Speaker 1>Maybe a little bit skeptical,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think that people tend to be </v>

586
00:36:33.751 --> 00:36:36.190
<v Speaker 1>result oriented and that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

587
00:36:36.220 --> 00:36:37.053
<v Speaker 1>on the right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there may be much more support for </v>

588
00:36:38.521 --> 00:36:39.354
<v Speaker 1>freedom of speech on campus because they</v>
<v Speaker 1>see that it's views on the right that </v>

589
00:36:42.871 --> 00:36:44.970
<v Speaker 1>are being squelched now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fairness,</v>

590
00:36:44.971 --> 00:36:47.280
<v Speaker 1>I'll give you a counterexample,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

591
00:36:47.340 --> 00:36:52.170
<v Speaker 1>many years ago during this first surge </v>
<v Speaker 1>of political correctness on campus,</v>

592
00:36:52.440 --> 00:36:54.440
<v Speaker 1>mitch mcconnell,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

593
00:36:54.680 --> 00:36:55.410
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let me,</v>

594
00:36:55.410 --> 00:36:57.180
<v Speaker 1>let me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let me put it backwards.</v>

595
00:36:58.460 --> 00:37:00.660
<v Speaker 1>It was Henry Hyde,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sorry,</v>

596
00:37:00.661 --> 00:37:01.494
<v Speaker 1>a conservative catholic from Illinois </v>
<v Speaker 1>who was completely on the opposite side </v>

597
00:37:07.141 --> 00:37:10.200
<v Speaker 1>of the acl,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you on abortion and gay rights.</v>

598
00:37:10.420 --> 00:37:11.253
<v Speaker 1>And he really was so strong on campus </v>
<v Speaker 1>free speech that he sponsored a bill </v>

599
00:37:18.090 --> 00:37:18.923
<v Speaker 1>that would have required all private </v>
<v Speaker 1>universities to respeCt the same free </v>

600
00:37:24.211 --> 00:37:25.044
<v Speaker 1>speech rights that public universities </v>
<v Speaker 1>are required to observe under the </v>

601
00:37:28.741 --> 00:37:31.170
<v Speaker 1>constitution.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Many people don't know this,</v>

602
00:37:31.171 --> 00:37:35.820
<v Speaker 1>but the constitution only applies to </v>
<v Speaker 1>government including state universities,</v>

603
00:37:35.821 --> 00:37:38.330
<v Speaker 1>but not private university.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How did you guys feel about.</v>

604
00:37:38.370 --> 00:37:40.150
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we totally supportive the legis.</v>

605
00:37:40.170 --> 00:37:41.003
<v Speaker 1>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that would be a difference between </v>

606
00:37:41.910 --> 00:37:45.870
<v Speaker 1>libertarians and civil libertarians.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My libertarian friends would say,</v>

607
00:37:46.080 --> 00:37:49.350
<v Speaker 1>keep the government out of it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let the private institutions decide.</v>

608
00:37:49.590 --> 00:37:52.530
<v Speaker 1>And there were exemptions for religious </v>
<v Speaker 1>institutions.</v>

609
00:37:52.531 --> 00:37:55.020
<v Speaker 1>But basically I think that's where I </v>
<v Speaker 1>would fall on this.</v>

610
00:37:55.021 --> 00:37:56.660
<v Speaker 1>So sell me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sell me yoU your way then.</v>

611
00:37:56.750 --> 00:37:59.340
<v Speaker 1>It's a very interesting debate and I can</v>
<v Speaker 1>understand,</v>

612
00:37:59.400 --> 00:38:00.470
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the person,</v>

613
00:38:00.510 --> 00:38:01.343
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've had this discussion with my dear </v>

614
00:38:02.911 --> 00:38:05.550
<v Speaker 1>friends of the cato institute for many,</v>
<v Speaker 1>many years now.</v>

615
00:38:05.551 --> 00:38:06.384
<v Speaker 1>What's the difference between a </v>
<v Speaker 1>classical liberal or libertarian is </v>

616
00:38:08.960 --> 00:38:10.380
<v Speaker 1>civil libertarian?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

617
00:38:10.381 --> 00:38:11.214
<v Speaker 1>I think that we are less opposed to </v>
<v Speaker 1>government regulation when it is in the </v>

618
00:38:16.081 --> 00:38:16.914
<v Speaker 1>service of regulating very powerful </v>
<v Speaker 1>private sector actors that for all </v>

619
00:38:22.981 --> 00:38:23.814
<v Speaker 1>practical purposes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the way we were talking about civil </v>

620
00:38:26.341 --> 00:38:31.341
<v Speaker 1>society earlier can exercise coercive </v>
<v Speaker 1>power that stifles people's liberty.</v>

621
00:38:32.401 --> 00:38:34.780
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so what if you,</v>

622
00:38:34.900 --> 00:38:36.450
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you,</v>

623
00:38:36.460 --> 00:38:38.530
<v Speaker 1>if,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if we did not have the 19,</v>

624
00:38:38.531 --> 00:38:43.531
<v Speaker 1>64 civil rights act than even the most </v>
<v Speaker 1>powerful large landlord,</v>

625
00:38:44.560 --> 00:38:46.660
<v Speaker 1>employer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>corporation,</v>

626
00:38:46.661 --> 00:38:47.494
<v Speaker 1>private university or etc,</v>
<v Speaker 1>would be able to discriminate on the </v>

627
00:38:50.501 --> 00:38:53.260
<v Speaker 1>basis of race or gender under federal </v>
<v Speaker 1>law.</v>

628
00:38:53.261 --> 00:38:56.320
<v Speaker 1>They still can on the basis of sexual </v>
<v Speaker 1>orientation,</v>

629
00:38:56.740 --> 00:38:57.573
<v Speaker 1>I would view that as something that </v>
<v Speaker 1>could and should be remedied through </v>

630
00:39:00.911 --> 00:39:03.280
<v Speaker 1>passing a statute.</v>

631
00:39:03.370 --> 00:39:08.320
<v Speaker 1>Making that illegal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So usually report into,</v>

632
00:39:08.840 --> 00:39:10.530
<v Speaker 1>well I think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well first off,</v>

633
00:39:10.540 --> 00:39:12.100
<v Speaker 1>I agree with you your basic premise </v>
<v Speaker 1>here,</v>

634
00:39:12.101 --> 00:39:12.934
<v Speaker 1>just at the idea level,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a great place for a rich </v>

635
00:39:14.681 --> 00:39:15.550
<v Speaker 1>conversation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

636
00:39:15.910 --> 00:39:20.140
<v Speaker 1>The idea that the government would be </v>
<v Speaker 1>coming in and telling private schools,</v>

637
00:39:20.620 --> 00:39:22.060
<v Speaker 1>even though I understand what you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>saying,</v>

638
00:39:22.420 --> 00:39:24.910
<v Speaker 1>that they would have to adhere to these </v>
<v Speaker 1>codes.</v>

639
00:39:24.970 --> 00:39:25.803
<v Speaker 1>Even if I being the first amendment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't necessarily think of private </v>

640
00:39:30.401 --> 00:39:31.234
<v Speaker 1>school should have to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just think that ultimately the market </v>

641
00:39:33.960 --> 00:39:35.800
<v Speaker 1>would.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You'd either decide you want to go there</v>

642
00:39:35.801 --> 00:39:37.870
<v Speaker 1>or don't want to go there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This one,</v>

643
00:39:37.871 --> 00:39:39.520
<v Speaker 1>this one is definitely a tough one for </v>
<v Speaker 1>me.</v>

644
00:39:39.840 --> 00:39:40.673
<v Speaker 1>It's an interesting one and I definitely</v>
<v Speaker 1>can see the other side and I certainly </v>

645
00:39:43.301 --> 00:39:48.301
<v Speaker 1>would insist on some exemptions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Certainly for religious schools.</v>

646
00:39:48.521 --> 00:39:51.310
<v Speaker 1>I think military schools were also </v>
<v Speaker 1>exempt it.</v>

647
00:39:51.550 --> 00:39:52.383
<v Speaker 1>But then I want to give you another </v>
<v Speaker 1>example of a republican that I worked </v>

648
00:39:56.021 --> 00:39:57.370
<v Speaker 1>with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>mitch mcconnell,</v>

649
00:39:57.700 --> 00:39:58.533
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>worked very closely with the acl in </v>

650
00:40:01.060 --> 00:40:02.140
<v Speaker 1>opposing.</v>

651
00:40:02.500 --> 00:40:04.690
<v Speaker 1>Many people are going to be surprised to</v>
<v Speaker 1>hear this.</v>

652
00:40:05.230 --> 00:40:06.063
<v Speaker 1>The mccain feingold law a campaign,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so-called campaign finance like a </v>

653
00:40:10.651 --> 00:40:12.320
<v Speaker 1>lifetime ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We don't talk about that.</v>

654
00:40:12.580 --> 00:40:14.500
<v Speaker 1>A clu very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

655
00:40:14.501 --> 00:40:15.334
<v Speaker 1>we're the ones who argued buckley versus</v>
<v Speaker 1>valeo and arguing that the ability to </v>

656
00:40:20.350 --> 00:40:21.183
<v Speaker 1>spend money in order to promote a </v>
<v Speaker 1>message is protected free speech and it </v>

657
00:40:27.911 --> 00:40:28.744
<v Speaker 1>should be protected even when the speech</v>
<v Speaker 1>is engaged in by people who are </v>

658
00:40:33.130 --> 00:40:33.963
<v Speaker 1>organized into a group and including if </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're organized in the form of a </v>

659
00:40:38.681 --> 00:40:42.280
<v Speaker 1>corporation or a union or not for profit</v>
<v Speaker 1>corporation.</v>

660
00:40:42.281 --> 00:40:43.114
<v Speaker 1>so some liberals are really distressed </v>
<v Speaker 1>by that position and I think it's </v>

661
00:40:46.481 --> 00:40:49.630
<v Speaker 1>absolutely the correct line anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do you say to those?</v>

662
00:40:49.660 --> 00:40:53.170
<v Speaker 1>Those liberals are the lefties who do </v>
<v Speaker 1>get more upset about that in general,</v>

663
00:40:53.171 --> 00:40:54.004
<v Speaker 1>that you're just going to allow </v>
<v Speaker 1>corporations to endlessly pour money in </v>

664
00:40:56.171 --> 00:40:58.090
<v Speaker 1>the system and manipulate the system.</v>

665
00:40:58.090 --> 00:40:59.260
<v Speaker 1>And that's it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

666
00:41:00.070 --> 00:41:02.650
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what is the lesser of two evils?</v>

667
00:41:02.651 --> 00:41:07.651
<v Speaker 1>Would I rather have the government </v>
<v Speaker 1>telling corporations such as the acl,</v>

668
00:41:08.231 --> 00:41:12.100
<v Speaker 1>you and planned parenthood and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>sierra club,</v>

669
00:41:12.101 --> 00:41:12.934
<v Speaker 1>you name your favorite left wing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so called cause and it is organized </v>

670
00:41:16.931 --> 00:41:21.070
<v Speaker 1>incorporate form and the acu under that </v>
<v Speaker 1>law was,</v>

671
00:41:21.130 --> 00:41:21.963
<v Speaker 1>it would have been a crime to go on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>airwaves and by name call on people who </v>

672
00:41:27.671 --> 00:41:30.190
<v Speaker 1>are running for federal office and say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

673
00:41:30.191 --> 00:41:32.290
<v Speaker 1>repeal the patriot act,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

674
00:41:32.650 --> 00:41:33.483
<v Speaker 1>because arguing for issues over the </v>
<v Speaker 1>broadcast airwaves was a crime under </v>

675
00:41:39.651 --> 00:41:44.651
<v Speaker 1>that law and spending your own money to </v>
<v Speaker 1>advance your own issue oriented message.</v>

676
00:41:45.981 --> 00:41:46.814
<v Speaker 1>So I think people are shocked When they </v>
<v Speaker 1>hear what the law actually did and are </v>

677
00:41:50.721 --> 00:41:54.350
<v Speaker 1>persuaded that in at least some </v>
<v Speaker 1>applications that went too far.</v>

678
00:41:54.650 --> 00:41:55.483
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>mcconnell became such a supporter of </v>

679
00:41:58.101 --> 00:41:58.934
<v Speaker 1>free speech as a result of working on </v>
<v Speaker 1>this issue that he actually changed his </v>

680
00:42:04.041 --> 00:42:04.874
<v Speaker 1>position on the flag burning amendment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He had been a big proponent of it and </v>

681
00:42:10.430 --> 00:42:11.263
<v Speaker 1>having seen how important freedom of </v>
<v Speaker 1>speech was including for what to </v>

682
00:42:16.251 --> 00:42:19.790
<v Speaker 1>liberals,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is a very controversial form of speech,</v>

683
00:42:19.791 --> 00:42:22.490
<v Speaker 1>namely spending money in the political </v>
<v Speaker 1>process.</v>

684
00:42:23.330 --> 00:42:24.141
<v Speaker 1>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

685
00:42:24.141 --> 00:42:26.900
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've got to stick to principles here and</v>

686
00:42:27.620 --> 00:42:32.620
<v Speaker 1>we should not amend the constitution to </v>
<v Speaker 1>outlaw another controversial expression.</v>

687
00:42:33.691 --> 00:42:34.524
<v Speaker 1>So I thought that was a really wonderful</v>
<v Speaker 1>idea of not just being result oriented </v>

688
00:42:38.091 --> 00:42:43.091
<v Speaker 1>toward your own ideological concerns,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but seeing the overarching principle and</v>

689
00:42:43.280 --> 00:42:44.113
<v Speaker 1>following it.</v>

690
00:42:44.280 --> 00:42:46.200
<v Speaker 2>It's almost like if you actually have </v>
<v Speaker 2>the debate,</v>

691
00:42:46.201 --> 00:42:50.100
<v Speaker 2>you might change people's mind and be </v>
<v Speaker 2>surprised who your allies are.</v>

692
00:42:50.610 --> 00:42:51.443
<v Speaker 2>Is there any country that is protecting </v>
<v Speaker 2>these rights better than we are for as </v>

693
00:42:56.281 --> 00:42:57.990
<v Speaker 2>screwy as our system may be?</v>

694
00:42:58.400 --> 00:42:59.840
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

695
00:43:00.050 --> 00:43:04.160
<v Speaker 1>well let me make a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a on sexual expression.</v>

696
00:43:04.190 --> 00:43:09.190
<v Speaker 1>The United States is a much more </v>
<v Speaker 1>repressive than a european.</v>

697
00:43:10.160 --> 00:43:13.390
<v Speaker 1>Some many european countries.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But like in what regard?</v>

698
00:43:13.410 --> 00:43:15.110
<v Speaker 1>You mean with what can be seen in </v>
<v Speaker 1>magazines or.</v>

699
00:43:15.640 --> 00:43:17.660
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so we still have a,</v>

700
00:43:17.661 --> 00:43:21.440
<v Speaker 1>I mean not only sexual expression but </v>
<v Speaker 1>four letter words.</v>

701
00:43:21.441 --> 00:43:22.274
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>thank goodness we're not broadcasting </v>

702
00:43:24.350 --> 00:43:28.260
<v Speaker 1>because I still get bleeped even when I </v>
<v Speaker 1>try to do whatever you want,</v>

703
00:43:28.340 --> 00:43:30.050
<v Speaker 1>all seven of them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

704
00:43:30.110 --> 00:43:30.943
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

705
00:43:31.020 --> 00:43:35.210
<v Speaker 1>and one of them appears,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I'm not even sure if this was one of</v>

706
00:43:35.211 --> 00:43:37.100
<v Speaker 1>these seven,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but fuck,</v>

707
00:43:37.160 --> 00:43:42.160
<v Speaker 1>the draft was upheld as of in a very </v>
<v Speaker 1>important free speech case.</v>

708
00:43:43.800 --> 00:43:44.633
<v Speaker 1>It that by the United States supreme </v>
<v Speaker 1>court and it's a case that has </v>

709
00:43:47.661 --> 00:43:48.494
<v Speaker 1>ramifications for hate speech as well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I cannot describe the facts of that </v>

710
00:43:52.911 --> 00:43:56.020
<v Speaker 1>case on radio or tv and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>

711
00:43:56.021 --> 00:43:57.200
<v Speaker 1>that's laughable.</v>

712
00:43:57.200 --> 00:44:01.130
<v Speaker 1>And other countries and we still have </v>
<v Speaker 1>anti obscenity.</v>

713
00:44:01.160 --> 00:44:01.910
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

714
00:44:01.910 --> 00:44:05.400
<v Speaker 1>let's not forget that the brouhaha about</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

715
00:44:05.440 --> 00:44:09.350
<v Speaker 1>the wardrobe malfunction at super bowl,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's,</v>

716
00:44:09.351 --> 00:44:10.184
<v Speaker 1>so we're much more puritanical,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but when it comes to political </v>

717
00:44:12.921 --> 00:44:13.754
<v Speaker 1>expression,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there is no country that gives as much </v>

718
00:44:16.611 --> 00:44:20.060
<v Speaker 1>protection as we do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>including for hateful,</v>

719
00:44:20.090 --> 00:44:25.090
<v Speaker 1>racist speech and misogynistic speech,</v>
<v Speaker 1>including for defamation,</v>

720
00:44:25.831 --> 00:44:26.664
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a defamatory falsehoods about public </v>

721
00:44:29.601 --> 00:44:32.670
<v Speaker 1>officials and public figures.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's why,</v>

722
00:44:32.940 --> 00:44:33.773
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are so many libel lawsuits that </v>

723
00:44:35.581 --> 00:44:36.414
<v Speaker 1>are brought in the uk against what would</v>
<v Speaker 1>be clearly protected speech in this </v>

724
00:44:39.781 --> 00:44:40.430
<v Speaker 1>country.</v>

725
00:44:40.430 --> 00:44:41.263
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you do believe in our libel laws </v>

726
00:44:42.621 --> 00:44:43.454
<v Speaker 2>here.</v>

727
00:44:43.490 --> 00:44:46.160
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>

728
00:44:46.170 --> 00:44:46.921
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

729
00:44:46.921 --> 00:44:47.251
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

730
00:44:47.251 --> 00:44:50.190
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure I would want to trim them back </v>
<v Speaker 1>a little bit,</v>

731
00:44:50.191 --> 00:44:55.191
<v Speaker 1>but on the whole were quite protective.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if it's a matter of public concern or</v>

732
00:44:57.001 --> 00:45:01.950
<v Speaker 1>public official or public figure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you get quite a bit of leeway.</v>

733
00:45:01.951 --> 00:45:06.951
<v Speaker 1>You can't be held culpable unless you </v>
<v Speaker 1>have acted intentionally or recklessly.</v>

734
00:45:08.251 --> 00:45:09.084
<v Speaker 1>and I think that's correct.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And one of the things they're pretty </v>

735
00:45:10.651 --> 00:45:11.341
<v Speaker 1>specific.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

736
00:45:11.341 --> 00:45:12.174
<v Speaker 1>One of the things that trump wanted to </v>
<v Speaker 1>do as he said was to reform the libel </v>

737
00:45:15.121 --> 00:45:18.510
<v Speaker 1>laws to make it easier for a public </v>
<v Speaker 1>official to,</v>

738
00:45:18.750 --> 00:45:20.850
<v Speaker 1>to collect damages.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

739
00:45:20.851 --> 00:45:22.470
<v Speaker 1>a lot of people say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

740
00:45:22.471 --> 00:45:26.790
<v Speaker 1>come on to dean britain and Germany and </v>
<v Speaker 1>France and Canada and Australia,</v>

741
00:45:26.791 --> 00:45:27.624
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not as if they are to tell a in </v>

742
00:45:29.341 --> 00:45:30.174
<v Speaker 1>authoritarian countries,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if you read the examples in my book </v>

743
00:45:33.090 --> 00:45:38.090
<v Speaker 1>of the kinds of speech that are being </v>
<v Speaker 1>punished even with imprisonment,</v>

744
00:45:38.460 --> 00:45:40.890
<v Speaker 1>even with a criminal fines.</v>

745
00:45:40.890 --> 00:45:45.150
<v Speaker 1>And that's the tip of the iceberg </v>
<v Speaker 1>because for every punishment there is,</v>

746
00:45:45.151 --> 00:45:49.440
<v Speaker 1>there are countless numbers of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of self censorship incidence.</v>

747
00:45:49.620 --> 00:45:52.680
<v Speaker 1>It would really make your skin crawl.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But give examples,</v>

748
00:45:52.890 --> 00:45:53.723
<v Speaker 1>no matter what your ideology is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you should find something in there that </v>

749
00:45:56.551 --> 00:45:57.660
<v Speaker 1>you would say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh my goodness,</v>

750
00:45:57.661 --> 00:45:59.040
<v Speaker 1>I can't believe it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

751
00:45:59.041 --> 00:45:59.970
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

752
00:46:00.000 --> 00:46:02.310
<v Speaker 1>France,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a couple of years ago,</v>

753
00:46:02.910 --> 00:46:03.743
<v Speaker 1>criminally convicted,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they had a gay rights organization for </v>

754
00:46:09.091 --> 00:46:09.924
<v Speaker 1>calling the head of an anti gay rights </v>
<v Speaker 1>organization off homophobe that was </v>

755
00:46:14.431 --> 00:46:16.890
<v Speaker 1>considered to be hate speech.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

756
00:46:16.891 --> 00:46:18.960
<v Speaker 1>fortunately she wasn't sentenced to </v>
<v Speaker 1>prison,</v>

757
00:46:19.200 --> 00:46:22.560
<v Speaker 1>but she was subject to a very stiff,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fine,</v>

758
00:46:22.830 --> 00:46:25.180
<v Speaker 1>$3,500.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

759
00:46:25.190 --> 00:46:25.711
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

760
00:46:25.711 --> 00:46:28.410
<v Speaker 1>and then you think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what are the ripple effects of that?</v>

761
00:46:28.610 --> 00:46:30.930
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Have you guys track this case with,</v>

762
00:46:31.050 --> 00:46:34.890
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the comedian in the uk who had the dog?</v>

763
00:46:34.980 --> 00:46:35.541
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yes,</v>

764
00:46:35.541 --> 00:46:36.374
<v Speaker 2>absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

765
00:46:36.960 --> 00:46:37.651
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>

766
00:46:37.651 --> 00:46:38.484
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>

767
00:46:39.240 --> 00:46:41.010
<v Speaker 2>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>first off he was making a joke.</v>

768
00:46:41.310 --> 00:46:44.310
<v Speaker 1>there's no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's no exception for humor or satire</v>

769
00:46:44.910 --> 00:46:45.743
<v Speaker 1>when the new online hate speech laws </v>
<v Speaker 1>went into effect in Germany on January </v>

770
00:46:50.970 --> 00:46:51.803
<v Speaker 1>1st,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the first person convicted or charged </v>

771
00:46:54.031 --> 00:46:57.930
<v Speaker 1>under it was one of the leaders of a </v>
<v Speaker 1>right wing party.</v>

772
00:46:57.960 --> 00:47:00.420
<v Speaker 1>Not surprisingly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the very in the.</v>

773
00:47:00.421 --> 00:47:03.240
<v Speaker 1>MAybe the first two that were charged </v>
<v Speaker 1>were from that party,</v>

774
00:47:03.420 --> 00:47:04.253
<v Speaker 1>but the very next one was a satirical </v>
<v Speaker 1>magazine that was making fun of their </v>

775
00:47:09.630 --> 00:47:11.400
<v Speaker 1>statements,</v>
<v Speaker 1>mocking them,</v>

776
00:47:11.401 --> 00:47:13.310
<v Speaker 1>ridIculing and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

777
00:47:13.320 --> 00:47:14.153
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and these laws by being so subjective </v>

778
00:47:15.631 --> 00:47:18.080
<v Speaker 1>can't make the fine distinctions between</v>
<v Speaker 1>humor,</v>

779
00:47:18.081 --> 00:47:20.370
<v Speaker 1>satire and straightforward advocacy.</v>

780
00:47:20.570 --> 00:47:21.403
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So my audience knows I'm not big on the </v>

781
00:47:23.240 --> 00:47:27.240
<v Speaker 2>globalist ideas here or even the un I </v>
<v Speaker 2>think is mostly a forest at this point,</v>

782
00:47:27.250 --> 00:47:30.790
<v Speaker 2>but do we need some sort of internet </v>
<v Speaker 2>bill of rights?</v>

783
00:47:30.791 --> 00:47:31.624
<v Speaker 2>I mean this is a new phrase that we're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that seems to be popping up over the </v>

784
00:47:34.570 --> 00:47:38.540
<v Speaker 2>last year or so that will uniformly </v>
<v Speaker 2>protect people in other country from,</v>

785
00:47:38.910 --> 00:47:39.743
<v Speaker 2>be for their ability to say things that </v>
<v Speaker 2>are uncomfortable online and be able to </v>

786
00:47:43.541 --> 00:47:44.930
<v Speaker 2>tweet things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

787
00:47:45.110 --> 00:47:45.761
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

788
00:47:45.761 --> 00:47:48.220
<v Speaker 2>you can't say in Germany,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you can say in the United States,</v>

789
00:47:48.260 --> 00:47:49.093
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think we have to do that on a country </v>

790
00:47:50.711 --> 00:47:51.544
<v Speaker 1>by country basis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I am pleased that there are </v>

791
00:47:54.970 --> 00:47:59.970
<v Speaker 1>advocates in other countries that really</v>
<v Speaker 1>strongly support freedom of speech,</v>

792
00:48:00.910 --> 00:48:01.743
<v Speaker 1>including for hate speech.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I keep putting that in air quotes </v>

793
00:48:04.391 --> 00:48:05.224
<v Speaker 1>because it is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as I say to that person and you're at </v>

794
00:48:07.751 --> 00:48:11.380
<v Speaker 1>the university of New Hampshire now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there really is no such thing.</v>

795
00:48:11.381 --> 00:48:12.214
<v Speaker 1>And by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are a lot of what they saId to </v>

796
00:48:13.601 --> 00:48:14.434
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some people would consider to be hate </v>

797
00:48:15.731 --> 00:48:16.564
<v Speaker 1>speech too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's another argument that you </v>

798
00:48:18.521 --> 00:48:19.170
<v Speaker 1>could have made.</v>

799
00:48:19.170 --> 00:48:23.070
<v Speaker 2>Do you realize that's my one regret is </v>
<v Speaker 2>at one point when she said to me,</v>

800
00:48:23.071 --> 00:48:23.904
<v Speaker 2>I said something about losing holocaust,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a family members from august on both </v>

801
00:48:26.701 --> 00:48:27.534
<v Speaker 2>sides and then later she said they're </v>
<v Speaker 2>rolling in their graves over what I'm </v>

802
00:48:30.781 --> 00:48:31.440
<v Speaker 2>saying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

803
00:48:31.440 --> 00:48:33.060
<v Speaker 2>trying to think like if this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if we're really,</v>

804
00:48:33.250 --> 00:48:35.460
<v Speaker 2>if we're really gauging the offense </v>
<v Speaker 2>meter,</v>

805
00:48:36.240 --> 00:48:37.073
<v Speaker 2>I assure you there was nothing that I </v>
<v Speaker 2>said in those two hours that was more </v>

806
00:48:40.021 --> 00:48:40.854
<v Speaker 2>wildly offensive than that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But do I want her jailed because of </v>

807
00:48:43.501 --> 00:48:44.334
<v Speaker 2>that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

808
00:48:44.370 --> 00:48:45.390
<v Speaker 1>of course not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

809
00:48:45.660 --> 00:48:46.493
<v Speaker 1>So I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I really was heartened at how much </v>

810
00:48:49.800 --> 00:48:54.090
<v Speaker 1>support there is for the american </v>
<v Speaker 1>approach.</v>

811
00:48:54.130 --> 00:48:55.350
<v Speaker 1>We,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're often,</v>

812
00:48:55.390 --> 00:48:56.223
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>attacked as being american </v>

813
00:48:58.140 --> 00:49:03.140
<v Speaker 1>exceptionalists and it wouldn't bother </v>
<v Speaker 1>me if we were the only ones in the,</v>

814
00:49:03.230 --> 00:49:04.063
<v Speaker 1>in the world that we're defending our </v>
<v Speaker 1>free speech principles as long as that </v>

815
00:49:07.111 --> 00:49:07.944
<v Speaker 1>is the right thing to do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's interesting that other people </v>

816
00:49:10.201 --> 00:49:15.201
<v Speaker 1>having seen despite the good intentions </v>
<v Speaker 1>of sensorial laws elsewhere,</v>

817
00:49:15.541 --> 00:49:16.374
<v Speaker 1>how they are leading to results that no </v>
<v Speaker 1>thinking person should accept and </v>

818
00:49:20.880 --> 00:49:25.110
<v Speaker 1>handing over to these online.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So here we get to this question again,</v>

819
00:49:25.111 --> 00:49:26.880
<v Speaker 1>and I'll put it this way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dave,</v>

820
00:49:26.910 --> 00:49:30.720
<v Speaker 1>what's the lesser of two evils to allow </v>
<v Speaker 1>these private,</v>

821
00:49:31.100 --> 00:49:34.050
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>agglomerations of power,</v>

822
00:49:34.350 --> 00:49:37.740
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>internet and companies decide,</v>

823
00:49:37.741 --> 00:49:40.940
<v Speaker 1>pick and choose whose speech is allowed </v>
<v Speaker 1>and who's not,</v>

824
00:49:41.280 --> 00:49:42.113
<v Speaker 1>and enforcing their own concepts of hate</v>
<v Speaker 1>speech or pornography or permissible or </v>

825
00:49:46.381 --> 00:49:50.190
<v Speaker 1>impermissible nudity to pick just a few </v>
<v Speaker 1>examples that they enforce.</v>

826
00:49:50.490 --> 00:49:51.323
<v Speaker 1>Would I rather have them have that </v>
<v Speaker 1>enormouS power or would I rather have </v>

827
00:49:54.751 --> 00:49:56.760
<v Speaker 1>the government say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

828
00:49:56.761 --> 00:49:57.594
<v Speaker 1>we're gonna check your power to restrict</v>
<v Speaker 1>other people's free speech rights and </v>

829
00:50:01.801 --> 00:50:03.640
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to me that's a very difficult.</v>

830
00:50:03.641 --> 00:50:03.720
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

831
00:50:03.720 --> 00:50:04.610
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's it.</v>

832
00:50:04.611 --> 00:50:05.444
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's exactly where we were before </v>

833
00:50:07.051 --> 00:50:07.884
<v Speaker 2>with the universities.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's where I would say ultimately </v>

834
00:50:10.050 --> 00:50:13.140
<v Speaker 2>right now are for,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know how many internet companies</v>

835
00:50:13.141 --> 00:50:16.290
<v Speaker 2>we have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's say comcast spectrum.</v>

836
00:50:16.680 --> 00:50:18.030
<v Speaker 2>They're all one at some level.</v>

837
00:50:18.230 --> 00:50:19.063
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're of the net neutrality issue and </v>

838
00:50:20.820 --> 00:50:23.220
<v Speaker 1>I'm thinking of the social media that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

839
00:50:23.280 --> 00:50:24.113
<v Speaker 1>the facebooks and the twitters having </v>
<v Speaker 1>these armies of enforcer saying that's </v>

840
00:50:27.651 --> 00:50:29.180
<v Speaker 1>hate speech.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're going to take it down.</v>

841
00:50:29.280 --> 00:50:30.113
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I guess what I would say is that if </v>

842
00:50:31.651 --> 00:50:33.840
<v Speaker 2>there were certain internet companies </v>
<v Speaker 2>that were saying,</v>

843
00:50:33.841 --> 00:50:34.674
<v Speaker 2>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well we're not going to allow </v>

844
00:50:35.640 --> 00:50:36.473
<v Speaker 2>pornography on our pipes or we're not </v>
<v Speaker 2>going to allow this type of speech or </v>

845
00:50:39.631 --> 00:50:40.464
<v Speaker 2>that type of speech.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would still prefer that you as the </v>

846
00:50:42.571 --> 00:50:43.404
<v Speaker 2>consumer would have more choice than </v>
<v Speaker 2>than the government saying we have to </v>

847
00:50:47.371 --> 00:50:50.250
<v Speaker 2>enforce all these things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But because of the,</v>

848
00:50:50.280 --> 00:50:51.113
<v Speaker 2>because of the internet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>now I know this is a unique situation </v>

849
00:50:53.401 --> 00:50:55.090
<v Speaker 2>related to free speech.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a little.</v>

850
00:50:55.210 --> 00:50:56.770
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in my ideal world,</v>

851
00:50:56.771 --> 00:50:58.870
<v Speaker 1>I'm completely with you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The question is,</v>

852
00:50:58.871 --> 00:51:01.090
<v Speaker 1>and I'm not an economist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my husband is,</v>

853
00:51:01.091 --> 00:51:02.770
<v Speaker 1>and he tells me that it's very </v>
<v Speaker 1>complicated.</v>

854
00:51:03.010 --> 00:51:03.843
<v Speaker 1>Have some of them amassed so much power </v>
<v Speaker 1>that we should use the antitrust type </v>

855
00:51:08.651 --> 00:51:09.484
<v Speaker 1>tools to prevent them for that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that they are denying us choice through </v>

856
00:51:13.961 --> 00:51:15.060
<v Speaker 1>their market power.</v>

857
00:51:15.120 --> 00:51:15.953
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So this is,</v>

858
00:51:16.010 --> 00:51:17.730
<v Speaker 2>there's a great conversation to be had </v>
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>

859
00:51:17.731 --> 00:51:21.180
<v Speaker 2>This is where my friends had prager </v>
<v Speaker 2>university who I agree with on all sorts</v>

860
00:51:21.181 --> 00:51:23.670
<v Speaker 2>of stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They were suing google,</v>

861
00:51:23.671 --> 00:51:26.310
<v Speaker 2>youtube over restrictions to their </v>
<v Speaker 2>videos,</v>

862
00:51:26.520 --> 00:51:27.353
<v Speaker 2>which I was in for because I don't want </v>
<v Speaker 2>the antitrust stuff to be in because to </v>

863
00:51:30.721 --> 00:51:31.554
<v Speaker 2>me that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that then means you Just create a </v>

864
00:51:32.671 --> 00:51:33.504
<v Speaker 2>zillion other problems down the road.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But that's a great place for a free </v>

865
00:51:36.211 --> 00:51:37.044
<v Speaker 2>speech person and an economist and </v>
<v Speaker 2>probably a technology guy to all sit </v>

866
00:51:40.351 --> 00:51:42.600
<v Speaker 2>down and work this stuff out without </v>
<v Speaker 2>choking each other.</v>

867
00:51:42.690 --> 00:51:43.523
<v Speaker 1>There was a real,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to me really frightening story in the </v>

868
00:51:45.631 --> 00:51:50.631
<v Speaker 1>New York times a few weeks ago featuring</v>
<v Speaker 1>a faCebook's deletion center.</v>

869
00:51:52.890 --> 00:51:53.723
<v Speaker 1>That's what it was actually called,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this huge building in berlin where they </v>

870
00:51:57.691 --> 00:51:58.524
<v Speaker 1>had literally hundreds of people that </v>
<v Speaker 1>are looking at individual posts and </v>

871
00:52:02.491 --> 00:52:05.670
<v Speaker 1>deciding should this be deleted and </v>
<v Speaker 1>should have not been deleted.</v>

872
00:52:06.570 --> 00:52:07.700
<v Speaker 1>And it was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

873
00:52:07.860 --> 00:52:09.390
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the examples,</v>

874
00:52:09.391 --> 00:52:12.870
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you realize how inevitably subjective it</v>

875
00:52:12.871 --> 00:52:15.870
<v Speaker 1>is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ultimately they took down when they took</v>

876
00:52:15.871 --> 00:52:16.704
<v Speaker 1>down this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this comment that was posted by the </v>

877
00:52:19.471 --> 00:52:20.304
<v Speaker 1>politician,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she was calling certain muslim men </v>

878
00:52:24.780 --> 00:52:27.090
<v Speaker 1>rapists.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the question was,</v>

879
00:52:27.120 --> 00:52:27.953
<v Speaker 1>was she referring to the particular </v>
<v Speaker 1>muslim immigrants who were in fact a </v>

880
00:52:32.250 --> 00:52:33.083
<v Speaker 1>convicted rapist?</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was a hOrrible incident on new </v>

881
00:52:35.520 --> 00:52:36.353
<v Speaker 1>year's eve a couple of years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in wHich case one would hope that would </v>

882
00:52:39.121 --> 00:52:39.954
<v Speaker 1>be protected speech because she's </v>
<v Speaker 1>describing something factual or was she </v>

883
00:52:44.010 --> 00:52:48.300
<v Speaker 1>perhaps insinuating that all muslim men </v>
<v Speaker 1>are rapists?</v>

884
00:52:48.301 --> 00:52:51.930
<v Speaker 1>Which would not be a generalization that</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would find objectionable,</v>

885
00:52:51.931 --> 00:52:53.200
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

886
00:52:53.250 --> 00:52:55.470
<v Speaker 1>but it would be illegal under german </v>
<v Speaker 1>law.</v>

887
00:52:55.680 --> 00:52:57.000
<v Speaker 1>And the official,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

888
00:52:57.001 --> 00:52:57.834
<v Speaker 1>these people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's their whole job to make these </v>

889
00:52:59.401 --> 00:53:01.980
<v Speaker 1>decisions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They couldn't agree between themselves.</v>

890
00:53:02.300 --> 00:53:06.060
<v Speaker 1>and so of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're not sure which way it goes and</v>

891
00:53:06.061 --> 00:53:10.110
<v Speaker 1>you're facing a 50 million euro,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fine.</v>

892
00:53:10.111 --> 00:53:12.390
<v Speaker 1>If the german government says it is hate</v>
<v Speaker 1>speech,</v>

893
00:53:12.480 --> 00:53:13.313
<v Speaker 1>while guess what,</v>

894
00:53:14.930 --> 00:53:15.763
<v Speaker 2>what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what do you think right now is our </v>

895
00:53:16.521 --> 00:53:17.354
<v Speaker 2>biggest censorship threat?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Where do you think is coming on the </v>

896
00:53:20.901 --> 00:53:21.734
<v Speaker 2>horizon?</v>

897
00:53:21.930 --> 00:53:26.040
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to be very general because </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's been the same answer had throughout</v>

898
00:53:26.041 --> 00:53:26.874
<v Speaker 1>my decades of activism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is lack of public understanding </v>

899
00:53:31.140 --> 00:53:35.280
<v Speaker 1>and awareness of whaT the first </v>
<v Speaker 1>amendment is,</v>

900
00:53:35.310 --> 00:53:36.143
<v Speaker 1>what it does protect,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what it does not protect what the </v>

901
00:53:38.191 --> 00:53:39.024
<v Speaker 1>rationales are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I truly believe that the more people </v>

902
00:53:42.301 --> 00:53:43.134
<v Speaker 1>understand both what the principles are </v>
<v Speaker 1>and how we have evolved at toward those </v>

903
00:53:51.091 --> 00:53:51.924
<v Speaker 1>principles,</v>
<v Speaker 1>through historic experience that people </v>

904
00:53:54.061 --> 00:53:55.170
<v Speaker 1>will be supportive.</v>

905
00:53:55.360 --> 00:53:58.420
<v Speaker 2>So I'm curious during the whole nfl </v>
<v Speaker 2>Kneeling thing,</v>

906
00:53:58.810 --> 00:53:59.643
<v Speaker 2>I've made a couple of videos about it </v>
<v Speaker 2>and obviously we talked about it on the </v>

907
00:54:01.181 --> 00:54:03.040
<v Speaker 2>show,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I basically was saying,</v>

908
00:54:03.041 --> 00:54:06.430
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is free speech working.</v>

909
00:54:06.760 --> 00:54:07.593
<v Speaker 2>The president sAid what he said now I </v>
<v Speaker 2>would certainly prefer that the </v>

910
00:54:09.971 --> 00:54:12.040
<v Speaker 2>president not call people sons of </v>
<v Speaker 2>bitches.</v>

911
00:54:12.370 --> 00:54:14.320
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>But he's entitled to free speech.</v>

912
00:54:14.321 --> 00:54:16.150
<v Speaker 2>He didn't try to enact a law to stop </v>
<v Speaker 2>him,</v>

913
00:54:16.330 --> 00:54:19.990
<v Speaker 2>so he spoke.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The players could then deal or not neil,</v>

914
00:54:19.991 --> 00:54:21.340
<v Speaker 2>so they were able to do what they </v>
<v Speaker 2>wanted.</v>

915
00:54:21.670 --> 00:54:24.160
<v Speaker 2>The owners could then,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

916
00:54:24.161 --> 00:54:27.010
<v Speaker 2>find the players or not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they got to do what they wanted.</v>

917
00:54:27.011 --> 00:54:27.844
<v Speaker 2>The fans could say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to buy jerseys and a 10 games </v>

918
00:54:30.130 --> 00:54:33.340
<v Speaker 2>or I'm not good new,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so everyone speech,</v>

919
00:54:33.430 --> 00:54:36.220
<v Speaker 2>actually everyone's speech and action </v>
<v Speaker 2>was protected.</v>

920
00:54:36.340 --> 00:54:37.173
<v Speaker 2>You might have some consequences for it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but to me it was a great example of the </v>

921
00:54:40.541 --> 00:54:44.020
<v Speaker 2>whole thing working messy but working.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you think?</v>

922
00:54:44.270 --> 00:54:45.103
<v Speaker 1>Fair summation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>totally agree with that and I had a </v>

923
00:54:47.300 --> 00:54:48.133
<v Speaker 1>quite similar analysis myself to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>disappointment of people who did not </v>

924
00:54:51.741 --> 00:54:56.741
<v Speaker 1>realize that the nfl as a private entity</v>
<v Speaker 1>has its own rights,</v>

925
00:54:57.771 --> 00:54:58.604
<v Speaker 1>including its own free speech rights and</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought it was interesting that some </v>

926
00:55:01.161 --> 00:55:06.161
<v Speaker 1>of the owners said they would allow </v>
<v Speaker 1>their players to express their protest.</v>

927
00:55:06.400 --> 00:55:10.340
<v Speaker 2>Is in that case though,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is trump getting it as close to where it</v>

928
00:55:10.341 --> 00:55:15.170
<v Speaker 2>could be an issue for the acl,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you or other similar organizations as he</v>

929
00:55:15.171 --> 00:55:19.100
<v Speaker 2>can without directly calling for a law </v>
<v Speaker 2>because there is some other.</v>

930
00:55:19.250 --> 00:55:20.083
<v Speaker 2>I don't even know what that phrase is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there's something else happening </v>

931
00:55:22.461 --> 00:55:24.040
<v Speaker 2>there when he's calling you or</v>

932
00:55:24.120 --> 00:55:24.953
<v Speaker 1>threatening if he were threatening to </v>
<v Speaker 1>pass a law and he did that in one other </v>

933
00:55:30.261 --> 00:55:31.094
<v Speaker 1>context.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think he threatened that there should </v>

934
00:55:33.051 --> 00:55:33.884
<v Speaker 1>be some f an fcc license should be taken</v>
<v Speaker 1>away from some broadcasts or that comes </v>

935
00:55:38.391 --> 00:55:40.460
<v Speaker 1>much closer to the line and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>principal.</v>

936
00:55:40.461 --> 00:55:41.600
<v Speaker 1>Dave,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're exactly right.</v>

937
00:55:41.750 --> 00:55:42.583
<v Speaker 1>He does not give up his free speech </v>
<v Speaker 1>rights by virtue of being a government </v>

938
00:55:46.730 --> 00:55:47.563
<v Speaker 1>official,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if he is speaking in official </v>

939
00:55:49.671 --> 00:55:51.620
<v Speaker 1>capacity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

940
00:55:51.710 --> 00:55:52.543
<v Speaker 1>and threatening some adverse </v>
<v Speaker 1>consequences that could be seen as an </v>

941
00:55:56.990 --> 00:56:01.330
<v Speaker 1>abridgment of free speech under which </v>
<v Speaker 1>would violate the frasers amendment.</v>

942
00:56:01.340 --> 00:56:02.520
<v Speaker 1>ExActly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

943
00:56:02.521 --> 00:56:03.354
<v Speaker 1>so in the past,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think the closest supreme court case </v>

944
00:56:05.361 --> 00:56:06.194
<v Speaker 1>we have is we're a government commission</v>
<v Speaker 1>wrote a letter that threatened that It </v>

945
00:56:11.541 --> 00:56:12.374
<v Speaker 1>would take some action and even though </v>
<v Speaker 1>it wasn't starting a prosecution or it </v>

946
00:56:16.130 --> 00:56:19.460
<v Speaker 1>wasn't an order to cease the expression,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the court said,</v>

947
00:56:19.790 --> 00:56:21.830
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was a very functional,</v>

948
00:56:21.831 --> 00:56:22.664
<v Speaker 1>practical concept.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It would a reasonable person feel </v>

949
00:56:26.290 --> 00:56:31.290
<v Speaker 1>deterred in pursuing their free speech </v>
<v Speaker 1>after they hear this communication.</v>

950
00:56:32.050 --> 00:56:32.883
<v Speaker 1>And again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>reasonable people can disagree about </v>

951
00:56:34.181 --> 00:56:37.870
<v Speaker 1>what the answer to that is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's the question we should put in</v>

952
00:56:37.871 --> 00:56:41.050
<v Speaker 1>evaluating whether trump has crossed the</v>
<v Speaker 1>line or not.</v>

953
00:56:41.170 --> 00:56:42.003
<v Speaker 2>So one of the things that I saw when the</v>
<v Speaker 2>nfl released its new standard now for </v>

954
00:56:45.101 --> 00:56:45.934
<v Speaker 2>next season where the players are </v>
<v Speaker 2>allowed to stay in the locker room or </v>

955
00:56:48.311 --> 00:56:48.851
<v Speaker 2>not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>and again,</v>

956
00:56:48.851 --> 00:56:52.000
<v Speaker 2>everyone's choice will,</v>
<v Speaker 2>will or will not have consequence.</v>

957
00:56:52.240 --> 00:56:57.240
<v Speaker 2>I saw a lot of people that were sayiNg,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well clearly the government involved,</v>

958
00:56:57.520 --> 00:57:00.220
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>interfered behind the scenes.</v>

959
00:57:00.520 --> 00:57:01.900
<v Speaker 2>Now I know there's no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know you don't.</v>

960
00:57:01.920 --> 00:57:02.753
<v Speaker 2>I suspect you don't have some sort of </v>
<v Speaker 2>insider knowledge on something like </v>

961
00:57:04.451 --> 00:57:05.284
<v Speaker 2>thAt.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's where there would be a problem </v>

962
00:57:06.881 --> 00:57:08.850
<v Speaker 2>though if they were really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

963
00:57:08.860 --> 00:57:09.693
<v Speaker 2>behind the scenes meetings where they </v>
<v Speaker 2>were saying you're going to institute </v>

964
00:57:11.471 --> 00:57:13.480
<v Speaker 2>this new policy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But beyond that,</v>

965
00:57:13.481 --> 00:57:16.600
<v Speaker 2>but short of having that information,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everything kind of work.</v>

966
00:57:16.810 --> 00:57:18.450
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm there.</v>

967
00:57:18.970 --> 00:57:19.803
<v Speaker 1>There's another analogy I can think of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is where the government has </v>

968
00:57:22.841 --> 00:57:27.841
<v Speaker 1>threatened certain businesses that if </v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't adopt a voluntary,</v>

969
00:57:29.170 --> 00:57:33.130
<v Speaker 1>a restriction on speech,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then we're going to pass legislation.</v>

970
00:57:33.131 --> 00:57:33.964
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the movie rating system or a sound </v>

971
00:57:37.601 --> 00:57:38.434
<v Speaker 1>recording rating systems that we think </v>
<v Speaker 1>these labels are stigmatizing and </v>

972
00:57:43.091 --> 00:57:45.310
<v Speaker 1>therefore suppressing certain </v>
<v Speaker 1>expression,</v>

973
00:57:45.670 --> 00:57:46.503
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think there's a very strong argument </v>

974
00:57:47.981 --> 00:57:51.250
<v Speaker 1>that the only reason this so called </v>
<v Speaker 1>voluntary system,</v>

975
00:57:51.490 --> 00:57:52.323
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was put in place in both businesses is </v>

976
00:57:53.951 --> 00:57:55.930
<v Speaker 1>because they knew that if they didn't do</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

977
00:57:56.140 --> 00:57:58.780
<v Speaker 1>the government was going to legislate </v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

978
00:57:59.120 --> 00:58:00.280
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but even that,</v>

979
00:58:00.310 --> 00:58:04.090
<v Speaker 1>the supreme court never held that that </v>
<v Speaker 1>was illegal censorship.</v>

980
00:58:04.160 --> 00:58:04.791
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All right.</v>

981
00:58:04.791 --> 00:58:07.970
<v Speaker 2>Well we can't talk free speech for an </v>
<v Speaker 2>hour and not mention the cake.</v>

982
00:58:08.540 --> 00:58:10.530
<v Speaker 2>We got to talk about the gay k.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jake,</v>

983
00:58:11.640 --> 00:58:14.610
<v Speaker 1>tell Me your thoughts on the gay cake.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

984
00:58:14.611 --> 00:58:16.650
<v Speaker 1>It's a I.</v>
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>

985
00:58:16.651 --> 00:58:21.651
<v Speaker 1>I think it involves not only expression,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I would define quite broadly.</v>

986
00:58:21.901 --> 00:58:23.820
<v Speaker 1>And again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let me talk about the,</v>

987
00:58:24.070 --> 00:58:24.903
<v Speaker 1>the standard here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Reasonable people can disagree how the </v>

988
00:58:27.281 --> 00:58:29.190
<v Speaker 1>standard applies to the facts of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>case.</v>

989
00:58:30.180 --> 00:58:32.790
<v Speaker 1>So the court has said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I think this is correct,</v>

990
00:58:32.791 --> 00:58:33.624
<v Speaker 1>that something comes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some expression comes or arguable </v>

991
00:58:36.481 --> 00:58:40.020
<v Speaker 1>expression comes within the ambit of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>first amendment.</v>

992
00:58:40.320 --> 00:58:45.320
<v Speaker 1>If it is intended to And can reasonably </v>
<v Speaker 1>perceived as conveying a message,</v>

993
00:58:48.511 --> 00:58:49.344
<v Speaker 1>at least a general message.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's the question you would ask </v>

994
00:58:51.721 --> 00:58:52.554
<v Speaker 1>about the cake.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think there's at least a plausible </v>

995
00:58:54.751 --> 00:58:58.140
<v Speaker 1>argument that the cake satisfied that </v>
<v Speaker 1>standard,</v>

996
00:58:58.440 --> 00:59:00.870
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in addition to expression,</v>

997
00:59:00.900 --> 00:59:04.080
<v Speaker 1>there's the question of religious </v>
<v Speaker 1>liberty,</v>

998
00:59:04.081 --> 00:59:06.600
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Which I defend very strongly,</v>

999
00:59:06.601 --> 00:59:08.460
<v Speaker 1>even more strongly than the supreme </v>
<v Speaker 1>court,</v>

1000
00:59:08.461 --> 00:59:11.260
<v Speaker 1>which has a quite narrow definition now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1001
00:59:11.280 --> 00:59:12.113
<v Speaker 1>but I think people should not be coerced</v>
<v Speaker 1>generally to do something that violates </v>

1002
00:59:15.691 --> 00:59:19.260
<v Speaker 1>their deeply held religious or </v>
<v Speaker 1>conscientious beliefs.</v>

1003
00:59:19.830 --> 00:59:20.663
<v Speaker 1>That's only one of the equation though,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because neither freedom of speech nor </v>

1004
00:59:24.711 --> 00:59:28.670
<v Speaker 1>religious freedom is absolute.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And in general,</v>

1005
00:59:29.090 --> 00:59:31.010
<v Speaker 1>the court has said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I think this is right,</v>

1006
00:59:31.370 --> 00:59:32.203
<v Speaker 1>that government can restrict those </v>
<v Speaker 1>freedoms if it can show that there is a </v>

1007
00:59:37.191 --> 00:59:42.191
<v Speaker 1>countervailing interests,</v>
<v Speaker 1>have such compelling importance that can</v>

1008
00:59:43.100 --> 00:59:48.100
<v Speaker 1>only be advanced by restricting the </v>
<v Speaker 1>expression or the belief.</v>

1009
00:59:49.340 --> 00:59:50.173
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the countervailing interest is of </v>

1010
00:59:52.731 --> 00:59:57.731
<v Speaker 1>course the dignity and equality of a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in this case gay people.</v>

1011
00:59:58.101 --> 00:59:58.934
<v Speaker 1>But in past cases,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's been african americans or women </v>

1012
01:00:02.151 --> 01:00:04.760
<v Speaker 1>because people have cited who are in </v>
<v Speaker 1>business,</v>

1013
01:00:04.761 --> 01:00:05.594
<v Speaker 1>have asserted religious justifications </v>
<v Speaker 1>for not serving members of racial </v>

1014
01:00:11.331 --> 01:00:14.090
<v Speaker 1>minorities or not treating women </v>
<v Speaker 1>equally.</v>

1015
01:00:14.450 --> 01:00:14.950
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

1016
01:00:14.950 --> 01:00:15.783
<v Speaker 2>but to be clear,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's not what was happening here </v>

1017
01:00:17.051 --> 01:00:19.930
<v Speaker 2>because they could have walked in and </v>
<v Speaker 2>bought any cake off the shelf.</v>

1018
01:00:19.931 --> 01:00:20.764
<v Speaker 2>A black person,</v>
<v Speaker 2>an interracial couple could have a </v>

1019
01:00:22.870 --> 01:00:24.880
<v Speaker 2>walked in and bought any cake off the </v>
<v Speaker 2>shelf.</v>

1020
01:00:24.881 --> 01:00:29.881
<v Speaker 2>This was about this specific act that </v>
<v Speaker 2>was going to be paint,</v>

1021
01:00:30.130 --> 01:00:32.170
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>painted or whatever they do on the case.</v>

1022
01:00:32.260 --> 01:00:33.180
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1023
01:00:33.190 --> 01:00:34.420
<v Speaker 1>it's interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

1024
01:00:34.480 --> 01:00:36.520
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and there's another,</v>

1025
01:00:36.580 --> 01:00:37.413
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>another free speech principle that's </v>

1026
01:00:39.401 --> 01:00:40.234
<v Speaker 1>involved here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is that government may not compel </v>

1027
01:00:44.140 --> 01:00:44.973
<v Speaker 1>somebody to proclaim a certain message </v>
<v Speaker 1>that they don't believe in anymore than </v>

1028
01:00:50.651 --> 01:00:54.160
<v Speaker 1>it may stop somebody from conveying a </v>
<v Speaker 1>message that they,</v>

1029
01:00:54.430 --> 01:00:58.310
<v Speaker 1>that they do believe in a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I would say I,</v>

1030
01:00:58.330 --> 01:00:59.270
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm very,</v>

1031
01:00:59.320 --> 01:01:02.470
<v Speaker 1>I think they're very strong concerns on </v>
<v Speaker 1>both sides.</v>

1032
01:01:02.471 --> 01:01:05.920
<v Speaker 1>So I'm very sympathetic because.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let me finish out the other argument.</v>

1033
01:01:06.730 --> 01:01:10.810
<v Speaker 1>Of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're an independent artist that is,</v>

1034
01:01:10.811 --> 01:01:13.960
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>only taking assignments on commission,</v>

1035
01:01:14.200 --> 01:01:15.033
<v Speaker 1>whether it be to paint a portrait or a </v>
<v Speaker 1>landscape or to decorate a cake and a </v>

1036
01:01:18.311 --> 01:01:20.710
<v Speaker 1>very elaborate way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's one thing.</v>

1037
01:01:20.711 --> 01:01:21.544
<v Speaker 1>But if you are doing business with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>general public and basically holding </v>

1038
01:01:25.931 --> 01:01:29.620
<v Speaker 1>yourself out as what the law would call </v>
<v Speaker 1>a public accommodation,</v>

1039
01:01:29.621 --> 01:01:34.621
<v Speaker 1>we're open to all commerce,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you may not discriminate on certain</v>

1040
01:01:34.870 --> 01:01:35.703
<v Speaker 1>bases such as race,</v>
<v Speaker 1>religion and I think even though you </v>

1041
01:01:38.501 --> 01:01:43.501
<v Speaker 1>still can as a matter of federal law </v>
<v Speaker 1>under state law in that state and and,</v>

1042
01:01:43.611 --> 01:01:44.444
<v Speaker 1>and others,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you cannot do that on the basis of </v>

1043
01:01:46.061 --> 01:01:47.230
<v Speaker 1>sexual orientation.</v>

1044
01:01:47.620 --> 01:01:48.453
<v Speaker 1>And so I think that very strong </v>
<v Speaker 1>countervailing equality principle I </v>

1045
01:01:53.321 --> 01:01:55.550
<v Speaker 1>think should,</v>
<v Speaker 1>should dominate in,</v>

1046
01:01:55.551 --> 01:01:56.384
<v Speaker 1>in this analysis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you actually weren't thrilled with </v>

1047
01:01:58.001 --> 01:01:59.830
<v Speaker 1>this decision that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well I was.</v>

1048
01:02:00.100 --> 01:02:05.100
<v Speaker 1>I was in the sense that there were so </v>
<v Speaker 1>many ways that the court could have gone</v>

1049
01:02:05.141 --> 01:02:07.240
<v Speaker 1>wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 1>have so many issues.</v>

1050
01:02:07.370 --> 01:02:12.250
<v Speaker 1>They said that it was not the best thing</v>
<v Speaker 1>they could do was to be very narrow.</v>

1051
01:02:12.251 --> 01:02:13.084
<v Speaker 1>And I actually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I were writing of the brief in the </v>

1052
01:02:14.531 --> 01:02:16.090
<v Speaker 1>case,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what I would do too,</v>

1053
01:02:16.120 --> 01:02:18.820
<v Speaker 1>because all of these principles are so </v>
<v Speaker 1>important.</v>

1054
01:02:18.821 --> 01:02:21.710
<v Speaker 1>I deeply care about freedom of </v>
<v Speaker 1>expression,</v>

1055
01:02:21.730 --> 01:02:25.650
<v Speaker 1>including the freedom not to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>compelled to affirm a message that,</v>

1056
01:02:25.651 --> 01:02:26.484
<v Speaker 1>that violates your beliefs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether they're religious or </v>

1057
01:02:29.161 --> 01:02:30.660
<v Speaker 1>conscientious,</v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't matter.</v>

1058
01:02:31.070 --> 01:02:34.650
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I also deeply believe in equality in</v>

1059
01:02:34.651 --> 01:02:37.740
<v Speaker 1>the public sphere and the facts were </v>
<v Speaker 1>murky.</v>

1060
01:02:37.741 --> 01:02:38.550
<v Speaker 1>So I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1061
01:02:38.550 --> 01:02:43.550
<v Speaker 1>as I think what happened in past </v>
<v Speaker 1>situations with race and gender,</v>

1062
01:02:45.870 --> 01:02:47.070
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1063
01:02:47.071 --> 01:02:47.904
<v Speaker 1>once things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>once the immediate resistance died down </v>

1064
01:02:52.051 --> 01:02:52.884
<v Speaker 1>to the 1964 civil rights act,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that it sort of worked its way out in a </v>

1065
01:03:00.151 --> 01:03:05.151
<v Speaker 1>way that is maximally respective </v>
<v Speaker 1>respectful of all the competing.</v>

1066
01:03:05.820 --> 01:03:06.653
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I think it's very good to avoid </v>

1067
01:03:08.941 --> 01:03:09.774
<v Speaker 1>really broad brush holdings that might </v>
<v Speaker 1>have unanticipated adverse consequences </v>

1068
01:03:14.401 --> 01:03:17.700
<v Speaker 1>for other factual situations.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that's an interesting take because I</v>

1069
01:03:17.701 --> 01:03:18.534
<v Speaker 1>saw some people saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well they're just sort of kicking this </v>

1070
01:03:20.281 --> 01:03:21.114
<v Speaker 1>down the road now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But basically you're saying in a weird </v>

1071
01:03:23.431 --> 01:03:28.200
<v Speaker 1>way that's the way a functional society </v>
<v Speaker 1>works at times.</v>

1072
01:03:28.500 --> 01:03:29.161
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1073
01:03:29.161 --> 01:03:33.000
<v Speaker 1>the court sets them general goal posts </v>
<v Speaker 1>and then as time goes by,</v>

1074
01:03:33.001 --> 01:03:33.834
<v Speaker 1>the controversy may die down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People may figure out how they can live </v>

1075
01:03:38.251 --> 01:03:41.730
<v Speaker 1>their own lives in ways that they're not</v>
<v Speaker 1>going to be bothered by,</v>

1076
01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:44.790
<v Speaker 1>by the government not being treated </v>
<v Speaker 1>disrespectfully.</v>

1077
01:03:44.970 --> 01:03:49.590
<v Speaker 1>One of the things that I really liked </v>
<v Speaker 1>about the opinion in that case,</v>

1078
01:03:49.591 --> 01:03:50.371
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1079
01:03:50.371 --> 01:03:54.720
<v Speaker 1>it's so contrasting to what's happening </v>
<v Speaker 1>in the european countries that I discuss</v>

1080
01:03:54.721 --> 01:03:55.554
<v Speaker 1>in my book is that the court talked very</v>
<v Speaker 1>strongly about equality and neutrality </v>

1081
01:04:02.550 --> 01:04:05.100
<v Speaker 1>in many different,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sorry,</v>

1082
01:04:07.860 --> 01:04:09.780
<v Speaker 1>in many different contexts.</v>

1083
01:04:09.780 --> 01:04:14.780
<v Speaker 1>So not only that you should be treated </v>
<v Speaker 1>with equal dignity regardless of who you</v>

1084
01:04:16.770 --> 01:04:21.210
<v Speaker 1>are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but also regardless of what you believe.</v>

1085
01:04:21.480 --> 01:04:23.550
<v Speaker 1>So the fact that the court was </v>
<v Speaker 1>respectful,</v>

1086
01:04:23.551 --> 01:04:24.384
<v Speaker 1>both of the equal dignity of the gay </v>
<v Speaker 1>couple and have the equal dignity of </v>

1087
01:04:30.751 --> 01:04:34.200
<v Speaker 1>their religious beliefs and the free </v>
<v Speaker 1>speech rights of the baker.</v>

1088
01:04:34.470 --> 01:04:37.020
<v Speaker 1>I really liked that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1089
01:04:37.021 --> 01:04:40.470
<v Speaker 1>one of the things that bothers me very </v>
<v Speaker 1>much about what a,</v>

1090
01:04:40.471 --> 01:04:45.471
<v Speaker 1>is often paraded as diversity on campus </v>
<v Speaker 1>is that it only looks at one dimension.</v>

1091
01:04:46.360 --> 01:04:50.070
<v Speaker 1>It looks at demographic diversity in </v>
<v Speaker 1>terms of who you are,</v>

1092
01:04:50.071 --> 01:04:52.680
<v Speaker 1>but not in terms of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of what you believe.</v>

1093
01:04:52.950 --> 01:04:56.430
<v Speaker 1>And in these european countries that are</v>
<v Speaker 1>enforcing hate speech laws,</v>

1094
01:04:56.490 --> 01:05:00.150
<v Speaker 1>you see them going both ways depending </v>
<v Speaker 1>on who's in power.</v>

1095
01:05:00.450 --> 01:05:05.450
<v Speaker 1>So certain religious beliefs are being </v>
<v Speaker 1>punished and criminalized as hate speech</v>

1096
01:05:06.061 --> 01:05:11.061
<v Speaker 1>If they run against what is a dominant </v>
<v Speaker 1>secular orthodoxy in those societies.</v>

1097
01:05:11.560 --> 01:05:14.370
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whereas in other communities,</v>

1098
01:05:14.630 --> 01:05:15.463
<v Speaker 1>a certain criticism of religion is </v>
<v Speaker 1>treated as hate speech and criminalized </v>

1099
01:05:19.691 --> 01:05:24.670
<v Speaker 1>when it's the religious belief that is </v>
<v Speaker 1>held by those in dominant power.</v>

1100
01:05:25.240 --> 01:05:28.030
<v Speaker 1>I think the main takeaway here is that </v>
<v Speaker 1>freedom is messy,</v>

1101
01:05:28.031 --> 01:05:30.490
<v Speaker 1>but we're doing a pretty decent job of </v>
<v Speaker 1>it here.</v>

1102
01:05:30.520 --> 01:05:33.130
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>thanks to those who keep agitating,</v>

1103
01:05:33.131 --> 01:05:35.190
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Eternal vigilance go well.</v>

1104
01:05:35.250 --> 01:05:38.270
<v Speaker 1>It's been a pleasure chatting with you </v>
<v Speaker 1>and for more on a dean,</v>

1105
01:05:38.530 --> 01:05:43.240
<v Speaker 1>check out her new book hate why we </v>
<v Speaker 1>should resist it with free speech,</v>

1106
01:05:43.450 --> 01:05:45.550
<v Speaker 1>not censorship,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we're going to link to it right down</v>

1107
01:05:45.551 --> 01:05:46.384
<v Speaker 1>below.</v>
