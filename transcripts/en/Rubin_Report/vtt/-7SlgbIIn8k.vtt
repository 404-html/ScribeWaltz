00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:31.110
<v Speaker 1>Demetrihevic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Usually I say it with a hard state.</v>

9
00:00:31.111 --> 00:00:32.870
<v Speaker 1>Demetrihevic Demetrihevic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

10
00:00:32.871 --> 00:00:37.230
<v Speaker 1>I was a big fan of draws in Petrovich </v>
<v Speaker 1>who was a basketball player from Croatia</v>

11
00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:40.230
<v Speaker 1>and the in the early nineties,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but some people said Petro Vic,</v>

12
00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:42.020
<v Speaker 1>and I could never tell rudy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tom.</v>

13
00:00:42.021 --> 00:00:43.460
<v Speaker 1>Johnny bench the old coach.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

14
00:00:43.461 --> 00:00:45.190
<v Speaker 1>That's properly hot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Check at the city,</v>

15
00:00:45.191 --> 00:00:47.010
<v Speaker 1>so I'm heretical.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Rudy Times daughters.</v>

16
00:00:47.011 --> 00:00:47.844
<v Speaker 1>That 95 Houston Rockets.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Steam is my favorite basketball team of </v>

17
00:00:49.831 --> 00:00:52.270
<v Speaker 1>all time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Clyde Drexler right there.</v>

18
00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:54.570
<v Speaker 1>There you go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As a Houston guy that has.</v>

19
00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:56.460
<v Speaker 1>That has meaning to you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>

20
00:00:56.461 --> 00:01:00.480
<v Speaker 1>I could talk basketball the entire time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but let's talk president by the title of</v>

21
00:01:00.481 --> 00:01:02.940
<v Speaker 1>your book.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We could probably talk about Reagan just</v>

22
00:01:02.941 --> 00:01:04.920
<v Speaker 1>as easily as we could.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Talk about JFK,</v>

23
00:01:04.921 --> 00:01:06.850
<v Speaker 1>who we're going to talk about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

24
00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:07.853
<v Speaker 1>do you have a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you have a preference out of those </v>

25
00:01:08.671 --> 00:01:09.240
<v Speaker 1>two?</v>

26
00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:10.073
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>our book JFK in the Reagan Revolution </v>

27
00:01:11.251 --> 00:01:12.084
<v Speaker 2>really is two thirds,</v>
<v Speaker 2>three quarters about John F Kennedy </v>

28
00:01:13.951 --> 00:01:14.784
<v Speaker 2>because we've forgotten that John F </v>
<v Speaker 2>Kennedy paved the way for the Reagan </v>

29
00:01:16.951 --> 00:01:17.900
<v Speaker 2>revolution and this big</v>

30
00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:19.210
<v Speaker 1>tax cut.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Alright,</v>

31
00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:22.190
<v Speaker 1>so jfk,</v>
<v Speaker 1>since he spent two thirds of it on JFK,</v>

32
00:01:22.191 --> 00:01:23.690
<v Speaker 1>that's the guy we're going to talk </v>
<v Speaker 1>about.</v>

33
00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:24.583
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I find with JFK that what it seems that </v>

34
00:01:27.921 --> 00:01:29.680
<v Speaker 1>most,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at least younger people know,</v>

35
00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:32.420
<v Speaker 1>say under 45 ish,</v>
<v Speaker 1>50 ish,</v>

36
00:01:32.421 --> 00:01:34.970
<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They know a lot about the assassination.</v>

37
00:01:34.971 --> 00:01:35.804
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>history channel runs the documentaries </v>

38
00:01:37.191 --> 00:01:38.270
<v Speaker 1>all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can watch the movie,</v>

39
00:01:38.271 --> 00:01:40.310
<v Speaker 1>JFK,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a zillion other,</v>

40
00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:42.110
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>things that are out there,</v>

41
00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:44.920
<v Speaker 1>but there's obviously a lot more to jfk </v>
<v Speaker 1>than,</v>

42
00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:47.030
<v Speaker 1>than just the unfortunate ending.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So let's,</v>

43
00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.893
<v Speaker 1>let's start at the beginning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do we need to know about early </v>

44
00:01:50.421 --> 00:01:52.970
<v Speaker 1>childhood,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Kennedy family,</v>

45
00:01:52.971 --> 00:01:53.510
<v Speaker 1>et Cetera?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Terry,</v>

46
00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:54.350
<v Speaker 1>let's start with childhood.</v>

47
00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:55.210
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It'll.</v>

48
00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:59.410
<v Speaker 2>John F Kennedy was born in May of 1917 </v>
<v Speaker 2>in a very,</v>

49
00:01:59.411 --> 00:02:00.760
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>important family,</v>

50
00:02:00.761 --> 00:02:04.090
<v Speaker 2>a family that was becoming one of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>richest in the United States.</v>

51
00:02:04.091 --> 00:02:05.470
<v Speaker 2>His father,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Joseph p Dot Kennedy,</v>

52
00:02:05.471 --> 00:02:06.304
<v Speaker 2>at that point in the teens that </v>
<v Speaker 2>graduated from Harvard about 10 years </v>

53
00:02:08.651 --> 00:02:09.484
<v Speaker 2>before,</v>
<v Speaker 2>was building his fortune would within </v>

54
00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:16.330
<v Speaker 2>Kennedy's a young childhood before he </v>
<v Speaker 2>turned 15.</v>

55
00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:20.080
<v Speaker 2>I'm his father had become one of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>richest men in the country.</v>

56
00:02:20.081 --> 00:02:20.914
<v Speaker 2>And actually just a peak.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Kennedy made most of his money in what </v>

57
00:02:23.531 --> 00:02:24.364
<v Speaker 2>we call the great contraction,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the worst period of American economic </v>

58
00:02:26.921 --> 00:02:30.550
<v Speaker 2>history from 1929 to 1933 when he short </v>
<v Speaker 2>sold the market.</v>

59
00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:32.860
<v Speaker 2>And that's really when the Kennedy's </v>
<v Speaker 2>became,</v>

60
00:02:32.861 --> 00:02:33.694
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the one of the top richest families in </v>

61
00:02:34.721 --> 00:02:35.554
<v Speaker 2>the United States.</v>

62
00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:38.320
<v Speaker 1>So how political was the Kennedy family </v>
<v Speaker 1>at that time?</v>

63
00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:39.101
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

64
00:02:39.101 --> 00:02:41.200
<v Speaker 2>it was pretty political.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Joseph p Dot Kennedy.</v>

65
00:02:41.201 --> 00:02:42.034
<v Speaker 2>John F Kennedy's father had married the </v>
<v Speaker 2>daughter of an important Boston </v>

66
00:02:44.621 --> 00:02:45.454
<v Speaker 2>politician.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then Joseph p was not involved in </v>

67
00:02:48.101 --> 00:02:48.934
<v Speaker 2>politics until FDR.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Franklin Roosevelt appointed him the </v>

68
00:02:50.981 --> 00:02:53.890
<v Speaker 2>first head of the Securities and </v>
<v Speaker 2>Exchange Commission in 1934.</v>

69
00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:57.100
<v Speaker 2>And then he became a big Roosevelt </v>
<v Speaker 2>Democrat.</v>

70
00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:59.950
<v Speaker 1>So that was the sort of beginning of</v>

71
00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:03.350
<v Speaker 2>the dynasty in the Kennedy name.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

72
00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:04.213
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So Jfk then tell me a little bit about </v>

73
00:03:06.371 --> 00:03:07.204
<v Speaker 2>sort of his evolution from a young </v>
<v Speaker 2>person to starting to become a </v>

74
00:03:10.361 --> 00:03:11.194
<v Speaker 2>politician.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

75
00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:12.143
<v Speaker 2>So John Jfk was the second son,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so there was the Joseph Kennedy junior </v>

76
00:03:17.651 --> 00:03:18.484
<v Speaker 2>who would be killed in World War II and </v>
<v Speaker 2>he wasn't a good student in prep school </v>

77
00:03:23.021 --> 00:03:25.680
<v Speaker 2>and he went to Princeton actually for a </v>
<v Speaker 2>semester.</v>

78
00:03:25.681 --> 00:03:27.400
<v Speaker 2>It didn't do well there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then went to Harvard,</v>

79
00:03:27.401 --> 00:03:29.680
<v Speaker 2>did not do particularly well until his </v>
<v Speaker 2>senior year,</v>

80
00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:33.640
<v Speaker 2>probably plagiarized his thesis,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which then somehow sold 80,000</v>

81
00:03:33.641 --> 00:03:35.440
<v Speaker 2>competence as a book when it was </v>
<v Speaker 2>published.</v>

82
00:03:35.441 --> 00:03:37.300
<v Speaker 2>But with his father's help.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Really.</v>

83
00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:38.143
<v Speaker 2>Wait,</v>
<v Speaker 2>are you telling me a little more about </v>

84
00:03:38.531 --> 00:03:39.670
<v Speaker 2>that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I haven't heard that one.</v>

85
00:03:39.671 --> 00:03:40.271
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

86
00:03:40.271 --> 00:03:41.410
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

87
00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:42.820
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>John F Kennedy,</v>

88
00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:45.550
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his father in 1938,</v>

89
00:03:45.551 --> 00:03:46.384
<v Speaker 2>39.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess this would have been at that </v>

90
00:03:47.681 --> 00:03:49.540
<v Speaker 2>point was the ambassador to the court of</v>
<v Speaker 2>St James.</v>

91
00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:50.373
<v Speaker 2>So it was the US ambassador to Great </v>
<v Speaker 2>Britain and was very interested in the </v>

92
00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:55.413
<v Speaker 2>United States fighting the Soviet Union </v>
<v Speaker 2>and not necessarily fighting Nazi </v>

93
00:03:58.270 --> 00:03:59.020
<v Speaker 2>Germany.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

94
00:03:59.020 --> 00:04:03.400
<v Speaker 2>and so that kind of caused diplomatic </v>
<v Speaker 2>problems with FDR foreign policy,</v>

95
00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:07.630
<v Speaker 2>but JFK had extraordinary access to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>files.</v>

96
00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:08.643
<v Speaker 2>And so he wrote a thesis that was </v>
<v Speaker 2>probably substantially ghost written </v>

97
00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:15.780
<v Speaker 2>about how England was dealing with the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Germany credits and then,</v>

98
00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:19.660
<v Speaker 2>and then it was published as a book and </v>
<v Speaker 2>it sold about 80,000</v>

99
00:04:19.661 --> 00:04:20.740
<v Speaker 2>copies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Of course,</v>

100
00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:23.360
<v Speaker 2>Kennedy would publish another book,</v>
<v Speaker 2>profiles in courage and Joseph,</v>

101
00:04:23.361 --> 00:04:24.900
<v Speaker 2>he would pull string.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So at one of the Pulitzer,</v>

102
00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:29.140
<v Speaker 2>it's good to come from a family.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is pretty good.</v>

103
00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:30.183
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so tell me a little bit more about how </v>

104
00:04:30.911 --> 00:04:33.600
<v Speaker 2>he then decided to get into about in </v>
<v Speaker 2>development.</v>

105
00:04:33.601 --> 00:04:34.040
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

106
00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:34.873
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the decisive event really was the death </v>

107
00:04:36.971 --> 00:04:40.330
<v Speaker 2>of his brother in 1944.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Joseph Kennedy Jr,</v>

108
00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:41.303
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>killed in World War II because really </v>

109
00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:45.310
<v Speaker 2>all the hopes were on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>on this son.</v>

110
00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:47.740
<v Speaker 2>And he apparently was a very impressive </v>
<v Speaker 2>guy.</v>

111
00:04:47.741 --> 00:04:50.260
<v Speaker 2>If you look at old pictures of the sun,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Joe,</v>

112
00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:54.250
<v Speaker 2>he was even way better looking than JFK.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was kind of bigger.</v>

113
00:04:54.251 --> 00:04:56.460
<v Speaker 2>JFK was always kind of skinny,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

114
00:04:56.500 --> 00:04:57.333
<v Speaker 2>and it really devastated the father when</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was killed in the war and they </v>

115
00:05:00.071 --> 00:05:00.671
<v Speaker 2>realize,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh boy,</v>

116
00:05:00.671 --> 00:05:01.504
<v Speaker 2>Jack is going to be the one where we're </v>
<v Speaker 2>going to have all these political hope </v>

117
00:05:03.351 --> 00:05:04.184
<v Speaker 2>son.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the father did not have high hopes </v>

118
00:05:05.351 --> 00:05:08.230
<v Speaker 2>for Ted at that point to Robert Robert,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe a.</v>

119
00:05:08.231 --> 00:05:09.640
<v Speaker 2>But right after Kennedy got out of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>war,</v>

120
00:05:09.641 --> 00:05:11.860
<v Speaker 2>of course he had his distinguished </v>
<v Speaker 2>career too.</v>

121
00:05:11.890 --> 00:05:15.100
<v Speaker 2>He ran for Congress in 1946.</v>
<v Speaker 2>His father pulled a lot of strengths and</v>

122
00:05:15.101 --> 00:05:18.220
<v Speaker 2>he won a seat in Brookline,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Massachusetts teams in the US House.</v>

123
00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:19.233
<v Speaker 2>What does Paul a lot of strings mean </v>
<v Speaker 2>because I just find the dynasty part of </v>

124
00:05:21.761 --> 00:05:22.594
<v Speaker 2>this fascinating.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The idea that they're sort of moving </v>

125
00:05:23.951 --> 00:05:24.784
<v Speaker 2>children,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that the power elite can sort of help </v>

126
00:05:26.981 --> 00:05:29.110
<v Speaker 2>people get into play here.</v>

127
00:05:29.140 --> 00:05:31.750
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>pull out a strings in the 1946 election,</v>

128
00:05:31.751 --> 00:05:33.850
<v Speaker 2>for example.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So on the ballot,</v>

129
00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:36.520
<v Speaker 2>Kennedy was running against a particular</v>
<v Speaker 2>opponents.</v>

130
00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:38.193
<v Speaker 2>His father found somebody else with the </v>
<v Speaker 2>exact same name and put that guy's name </v>

131
00:05:42.641 --> 00:05:46.660
<v Speaker 2>on the ballot and then had a whole </v>
<v Speaker 2>publicity campaign for that guy's name.</v>

132
00:05:46.661 --> 00:05:48.290
<v Speaker 2>I forget the exact name,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

133
00:05:48.700 --> 00:05:51.850
<v Speaker 2>to be voted for so that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that would split the vote.</v>

134
00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:55.090
<v Speaker 2>That takes a lot of money and a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 2>kind of,</v>

135
00:05:55.091 --> 00:05:57.500
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a naked ambition.</v>

136
00:05:57.620 --> 00:05:59.910
<v Speaker 2>So that's an example of the kind of </v>
<v Speaker 2>hardball,</v>

137
00:05:59.990 --> 00:06:03.020
<v Speaker 2>but he felt pled.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's a slight sidebar when you hear</v>

138
00:06:03.021 --> 00:06:06.680
<v Speaker 2>about all the craziness involved in </v>
<v Speaker 2>politics these days and everyone.</v>

139
00:06:06.681 --> 00:06:07.514
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's never been worse and listened to </v>

140
00:06:08.211 --> 00:06:09.044
<v Speaker 2>the way people talk and all that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like a lot of shady stuff has been </v>

141
00:06:11.811 --> 00:06:13.020
<v Speaker 2>going on for a long time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

142
00:06:13.100 --> 00:06:15.620
<v Speaker 2>I have no idea how we could look at,</v>
<v Speaker 2>say,</v>

143
00:06:15.621 --> 00:06:16.454
<v Speaker 2>the McCarthy era,</v>
<v Speaker 2>both how mccarthy was treated and how </v>

144
00:06:19.310 --> 00:06:20.143
<v Speaker 2>mccarthy treated others and say that </v>
<v Speaker 2>politics was warm and fuzzy back in the </v>

145
00:06:23.541 --> 00:06:24.380
<v Speaker 2>forties and the fifties.</v>

146
00:06:24.380 --> 00:06:26.080
<v Speaker 2>I have no idea how we could say that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

147
00:06:26.330 --> 00:06:27.163
<v Speaker 2>So did JFK,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do you think he had a presidential </v>

148
00:06:29.271 --> 00:06:30.104
<v Speaker 2>aspirations then when he started this?</v>
<v Speaker 2>This was sort of thrust on him and he </v>

149
00:06:33.421 --> 00:06:36.350
<v Speaker 2>and he became a congressman.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But was he already thinking about that,</v>

150
00:06:36.351 --> 00:06:36.890
<v Speaker 2>do you think?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

151
00:06:36.890 --> 00:06:39.810
<v Speaker 2>I think so in that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

152
00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:40.753
<v Speaker 2>it was well understood that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that Joe Jr was going to be something </v>

153
00:06:44.331 --> 00:06:45.164
<v Speaker 2>like president of the United States.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so when that could not happen after </v>

154
00:06:48.831 --> 00:06:50.090
<v Speaker 2>his death,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it'd be,</v>

155
00:06:50.091 --> 00:06:52.580
<v Speaker 2>became pretty clear to the sons.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

156
00:06:52.581 --> 00:06:53.414
<v Speaker 2>so there was still jack,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Robert and teddy left and then I think </v>

157
00:06:55.971 --> 00:06:59.420
<v Speaker 2>six girls that they had to take,</v>
<v Speaker 2>take that place.</v>

158
00:06:59.421 --> 00:07:01.380
<v Speaker 2>And so when he ran for Congress,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

159
00:07:01.510 --> 00:07:05.090
<v Speaker 2>I mean it was to go onward and upward.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So he was a congressman.</v>

160
00:07:05.440 --> 00:07:07.610
<v Speaker 2>How many years was he a congressman?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right up until he ran from.</v>

161
00:07:07.840 --> 00:07:10.890
<v Speaker 2>He was a US representative from </v>
<v Speaker 2>Brooklyn,</v>

162
00:07:10.891 --> 00:07:11.724
<v Speaker 2>Massachusetts from from 46 to 52.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then he won a US Senate seat in </v>

163
00:07:14.871 --> 00:07:15.704
<v Speaker 2>Massachusetts,</v>
<v Speaker 2>bucking the eisenhower a trend because </v>

164
00:07:19.131 --> 00:07:19.964
<v Speaker 2>he ran on the democratic side.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So he was one of the few democratic </v>

165
00:07:21.411 --> 00:07:24.830
<v Speaker 2>victories in the 1952 elections.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So then he was a senator for eight years</v>

166
00:07:24.831 --> 00:07:26.140
<v Speaker 2>before he became president.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

167
00:07:26.210 --> 00:07:28.640
<v Speaker 2>Did he have any major accomplishments as</v>
<v Speaker 2>a senator?</v>

168
00:07:28.670 --> 00:07:29.503
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the interesting thing because </v>

169
00:07:31.401 --> 00:07:34.820
<v Speaker 2>when we asked what were his major </v>
<v Speaker 2>accomplishments as president,</v>

170
00:07:34.850 --> 00:07:38.590
<v Speaker 2>let's say legislatively really comes </v>
<v Speaker 2>down to maybe one or two,</v>

171
00:07:38.660 --> 00:07:39.493
<v Speaker 2>the tax cut in the civil rights act,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so there's not a lot of major </v>

172
00:07:43.791 --> 00:07:46.310
<v Speaker 2>accomplishments and the whole Kennedy </v>
<v Speaker 2>biography.</v>

173
00:07:47.030 --> 00:07:52.030
<v Speaker 2>The funny thing about his career as a </v>
<v Speaker 2>legislator in the Senate in particular,</v>

174
00:07:52.220 --> 00:07:55.370
<v Speaker 2>this is big enthusiasms for two things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Number one,</v>

175
00:07:55.371 --> 00:07:56.204
<v Speaker 2>he was going after the mob,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which then his son route his brother </v>

176
00:07:59.451 --> 00:08:00.284
<v Speaker 2>Robert would be big on and number two is</v>
<v Speaker 2>an anti communist in foreign policy and </v>

177
00:08:04.780 --> 00:08:06.890
<v Speaker 2>that that's how we distinguish himself </v>
<v Speaker 2>as a senator.</v>

178
00:08:07.130 --> 00:08:07.963
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so it's interesting that the </v>

179
00:08:08.871 --> 00:08:12.530
<v Speaker 2>anticommunist part is interesting </v>
<v Speaker 2>because the parties have shifted so much</v>

180
00:08:12.531 --> 00:08:17.150
<v Speaker 2>these days that I'm not saying the left </v>
<v Speaker 2>or the Democrats are communists now,</v>

181
00:08:17.151 --> 00:08:20.990
<v Speaker 2>but that voice,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that sort of anti socialism,</v>

182
00:08:20.991 --> 00:08:25.130
<v Speaker 2>communism voice would rarely be heard of</v>
<v Speaker 2>from the lottery left,</v>

183
00:08:25.131 --> 00:08:26.870
<v Speaker 2>which does tell you how these things </v>
<v Speaker 2>have shifted.</v>

184
00:08:26.980 --> 00:08:27.813
<v Speaker 2>Joseph p dot Kennedy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his father became persona non grata in </v>

185
00:08:30.741 --> 00:08:31.730
<v Speaker 2>the U.</v>
<v Speaker 2>S government,</v>

186
00:08:31.790 --> 00:08:33.620
<v Speaker 2>when in 1938,</v>
<v Speaker 2>39,</v>

187
00:08:33.800 --> 00:08:34.633
<v Speaker 2>he told Franklin,</v>
<v Speaker 2>d dot Roosevelt from his high position </v>

188
00:08:36.351 --> 00:08:37.184
<v Speaker 2>as ambassador in Great Britain.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We don't have to worry about the Nazis </v>

189
00:08:39.701 --> 00:08:41.960
<v Speaker 2>so much.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We have to worry about communism because</v>

190
00:08:41.961 --> 00:08:44.720
<v Speaker 2>communism can overthrow the American way</v>
<v Speaker 2>of life.</v>

191
00:08:44.990 --> 00:08:45.823
<v Speaker 2>I think there's a pretty direct link </v>
<v Speaker 2>there to what his son was doing in the </v>

192
00:08:48.201 --> 00:08:49.820
<v Speaker 2>fifties and sixties.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's interesting.</v>

193
00:08:49.821 --> 00:08:53.030
<v Speaker 2>So he was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he viewed it as Nazi-ism was an external</v>

194
00:08:53.031 --> 00:08:54.320
<v Speaker 2>threat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not within our borders,</v>

195
00:08:54.321 --> 00:08:56.340
<v Speaker 2>but communism actually with something </v>
<v Speaker 2>that could come from.</v>

196
00:08:56.360 --> 00:08:57.300
<v Speaker 2>That was joe's feeling.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

197
00:08:57.390 --> 00:08:59.820
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was Kinda Kinda prophetic.</v>

198
00:08:59.900 --> 00:09:02.540
<v Speaker 2>And he was a new dealer and all that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You said,</v>

199
00:09:02.550 --> 00:09:03.181
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>new deal.</v>

200
00:09:03.181 --> 00:09:06.270
<v Speaker 2>The new deal can help save capitalism.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was an erroneous argument.</v>

201
00:09:06.271 --> 00:09:07.104
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but Joseph p dot Kennedy was worried </v>

202
00:09:08.850 --> 00:09:13.110
<v Speaker 2>about the onslaughts against capitalism.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Communism.</v>

203
00:09:13.240 --> 00:09:14.110
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Interesting.</v>

204
00:09:14.111 --> 00:09:18.740
<v Speaker 1>So it sounds like the Senate career was </v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of less than spectacular.</v>

205
00:09:18.850 --> 00:09:20.710
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't sound like anything major </v>
<v Speaker 1>happened.</v>

206
00:09:21.180 --> 00:09:22.890
<v Speaker 2>Kennedy was pretty careful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

207
00:09:22.910 --> 00:09:25.710
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he began his Senate career,</v>

208
00:09:25.800 --> 00:09:26.633
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>ailing.</v>

209
00:09:26.850 --> 00:09:30.000
<v Speaker 2>He had back surgery in 1953.</v>
<v Speaker 2>As soon as he became a senator and could</v>

210
00:09:30.001 --> 00:09:33.150
<v Speaker 2>not attend the Senate,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was in fact had to be reclined,</v>

211
00:09:33.470 --> 00:09:34.303
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for a very long time because his back </v>

212
00:09:35.731 --> 00:09:39.390
<v Speaker 2>injury and that's when he decided to </v>
<v Speaker 2>write profiles and courage,</v>

213
00:09:39.420 --> 00:09:44.420
<v Speaker 2>his 1956 book,</v>
<v Speaker 2>1955 when the Pulitzer in 1956 about the</v>

214
00:09:44.431 --> 00:09:48.390
<v Speaker 2>greats of the Senate over time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So because he was incapacitated,</v>

215
00:09:48.391 --> 00:09:49.224
<v Speaker 2>he wanted to show he was still doing </v>
<v Speaker 2>senate work by writing about Senate </v>

216
00:09:51.721 --> 00:09:52.160
<v Speaker 2>history.</v>

217
00:09:52.160 --> 00:09:52.993
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

218
00:09:53.110 --> 00:09:53.943
<v Speaker 1>God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what a beautiful thing to be in </v>

219
00:09:54.491 --> 00:09:56.200
<v Speaker 1>government.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't really have to do anything and</v>

220
00:09:56.201 --> 00:09:58.270
<v Speaker 1>you could write about the other guys </v>
<v Speaker 1>that did some stuff.</v>

221
00:09:58.271 --> 00:09:59.320
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's an incredible thing.</v>

222
00:09:59.740 --> 00:10:00.573
<v Speaker 1>Nineteen 60,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he becomes president and he defeats </v>

223
00:10:02.741 --> 00:10:05.080
<v Speaker 1>Richard Nixon who was vice president at </v>
<v Speaker 1>the time.</v>

224
00:10:05.320 --> 00:10:08.680
<v Speaker 1>I think the one thing that people really</v>
<v Speaker 1>remember is that debate.</v>

225
00:10:08.970 --> 00:10:09.803
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because he was sort of this young good </v>

226
00:10:11.771 --> 00:10:13.930
<v Speaker 1>looking guy and there was Nixon </v>
<v Speaker 1>sweating.</v>

227
00:10:13.931 --> 00:10:15.670
<v Speaker 1>Is there anything else we have to </v>
<v Speaker 1>remember from,</v>

228
00:10:15.820 --> 00:10:16.550
<v Speaker 1>from that election?</v>

229
00:10:16.550 --> 00:10:17.310
<v Speaker 2>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

230
00:10:17.310 --> 00:10:19.370
<v Speaker 2>So I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was debate in September 19,</v>

231
00:10:19.371 --> 00:10:24.371
<v Speaker 2>60 and people always say that Nixon won </v>
<v Speaker 2>on the radio and lost on televisions,</v>

232
00:10:24.621 --> 00:10:27.950
<v Speaker 2>that if people just heard his words or </v>
<v Speaker 2>even read the transcript,</v>

233
00:10:28.190 --> 00:10:31.010
<v Speaker 2>that he defeated Kennedy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But if you looked on the television,</v>

234
00:10:31.011 --> 00:10:32.900
<v Speaker 2>there's black and white television and </v>
<v Speaker 2>lots of viewers.</v>

235
00:10:33.080 --> 00:10:36.380
<v Speaker 2>A Kennedy was the youthful,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a bronze,</v>

236
00:10:36.590 --> 00:10:38.540
<v Speaker 2>which is probably from his Addison </v>
<v Speaker 2>Syndrome,</v>

237
00:10:38.570 --> 00:10:41.930
<v Speaker 2>not the Suntan,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a hero in Nixon looked like a schlub.</v>

238
00:10:42.350 --> 00:10:43.370
<v Speaker 2>Uhm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I dunno</v>

239
00:10:43.760 --> 00:10:46.280
<v Speaker 1>because it was in black and white,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's still even having.</v>

240
00:10:46.281 --> 00:10:47.114
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

241
00:10:47.170 --> 00:10:48.070
<v Speaker 2>Still helps.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And again,</v>

242
00:10:48.071 --> 00:10:48.904
<v Speaker 2>that was from one of his ailments.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean that wasn't from the South </v>

243
00:10:51.550 --> 00:10:53.670
<v Speaker 2>Pacific.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I dunno,</v>

244
00:10:53.710 --> 00:10:56.050
<v Speaker 2>I've read those transcripts and I think </v>
<v Speaker 2>Kennedy clearly won.</v>

245
00:10:56.310 --> 00:10:58.330
<v Speaker 2>I mean Nixon was saying things like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

246
00:10:58.331 --> 00:10:59.980
<v Speaker 2>there's been great economic growth in </v>
<v Speaker 2>this country.</v>

247
00:10:59.981 --> 00:11:01.390
<v Speaker 2>We're tipping into a recession,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

248
00:11:01.391 --> 00:11:02.470
<v Speaker 2>Then 400,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>

249
00:11:02.471 --> 00:11:04.540
<v Speaker 2>We're about to lose their jobs in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>month of October.</v>

250
00:11:04.750 --> 00:11:05.680
<v Speaker 2>And Nixon was saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

251
00:11:05.681 --> 00:11:06.514
<v Speaker 2>we've had the greatest economic growth </v>
<v Speaker 2>with that we've ever had under </v>

252
00:11:08.261 --> 00:11:10.810
<v Speaker 2>Eisenhower.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Been three recessions under Eisenhower.</v>

253
00:11:11.020 --> 00:11:11.853
<v Speaker 2>Now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think Nixon lost that debate on the </v>

254
00:11:12.851 --> 00:11:13.720
<v Speaker 2>transcript as well.</v>

255
00:11:13.870 --> 00:11:14.703
<v Speaker 1>Interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So just to get a sense of how parties </v>

256
00:11:16.961 --> 00:11:17.980
<v Speaker 1>have changed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what was the,</v>

257
00:11:18.010 --> 00:11:21.460
<v Speaker 1>what were the basic tenants that a jfk </v>
<v Speaker 1>was running on?</v>

258
00:11:21.570 --> 00:11:22.403
<v Speaker 2>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So John F Kennedy didn't know what he </v>

259
00:11:25.231 --> 00:11:28.380
<v Speaker 2>wanted to run on a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is a classic Kennedy thing.</v>

260
00:11:28.381 --> 00:11:32.520
<v Speaker 2>We know we must be president.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the question is what are we to run?</v>

261
00:11:32.521 --> 00:11:33.310
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

262
00:11:33.310 --> 00:11:34.143
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

263
00:11:34.170 --> 00:11:36.220
<v Speaker 2>it was really the Democratic National </v>
<v Speaker 2>Committee or the,</v>

264
00:11:36.320 --> 00:11:37.153
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the convention that summer that kind of </v>

265
00:11:38.851 --> 00:11:41.730
<v Speaker 2>defined for Kennedy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He had a lot to do with it of course,</v>

266
00:11:41.900 --> 00:11:43.950
<v Speaker 2>at what the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what he would run on.</v>

267
00:11:43.980 --> 00:11:44.813
<v Speaker 2>And he decided he would run the on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that the country was not growing enough </v>

268
00:11:47.790 --> 00:11:48.623
<v Speaker 2>and he made his tagline,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we have to get this country moving </v>

269
00:11:50.431 --> 00:11:51.264
<v Speaker 2>again.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We have all these old slow people in </v>

270
00:11:53.141 --> 00:11:57.330
<v Speaker 2>government and he kept making the point </v>
<v Speaker 2>that we have a lot of recession.</v>

271
00:11:57.331 --> 00:11:58.400
<v Speaker 2>So it was right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There was a recession,</v>

272
00:11:58.420 --> 00:12:03.420
<v Speaker 2>1954 big one in 1957 and then it was </v>
<v Speaker 2>coming right then in 1960 and he said we</v>

273
00:12:04.241 --> 00:12:05.074
<v Speaker 2>got to get out of this Rut,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he kept saying we have to get this </v>

274
00:12:06.491 --> 00:12:08.380
<v Speaker 2>country moving again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>get this country moving again.</v>

275
00:12:08.380 --> 00:12:09.213
<v Speaker 2>So that was his main thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then he also talked about after we </v>

276
00:12:11.410 --> 00:12:12.243
<v Speaker 2>helped,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we have to get a little tougher on </v>

277
00:12:12.731 --> 00:12:14.470
<v Speaker 2>communism because we're not moving </v>
<v Speaker 2>enough.</v>

278
00:12:14.471 --> 00:12:17.560
<v Speaker 2>The Soviets are starting to pass us by </v>
<v Speaker 2>and those were his big themes.</v>

279
00:12:18.100 --> 00:12:20.560
<v Speaker 2>So when you say that within a 20,</v>
<v Speaker 2>18 context,</v>

280
00:12:20.561 --> 00:12:22.450
<v Speaker 2>it's hard to believe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as I referenced earlier,</v>

281
00:12:22.451 --> 00:12:26.470
<v Speaker 2>it's hard to believe that a Democrat </v>
<v Speaker 2>would be running against sort of slow,</v>

282
00:12:26.830 --> 00:12:30.190
<v Speaker 2>inefficient government,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that is what he did.</v>

283
00:12:30.191 --> 00:12:31.410
<v Speaker 2>It's kind of incredible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

284
00:12:31.660 --> 00:12:36.660
<v Speaker 2>Now the Republicans back then were the </v>
<v Speaker 2>big deficit hawks there are like,</v>

285
00:12:37.060 --> 00:12:39.490
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe we've had some recessions,</v>

286
00:12:39.491 --> 00:12:40.324
<v Speaker 2>but we have a budget deficit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then we have to keep taxes high tax </v>

287
00:12:42.911 --> 00:12:45.220
<v Speaker 2>rates high,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so we take care of the budget deficit.</v>

288
00:12:45.250 --> 00:12:47.710
<v Speaker 2>Wouldn't be prudent or that'll George </v>
<v Speaker 2>Bush line.</v>

289
00:12:47.740 --> 00:12:48.573
<v Speaker 2>I mean that's very applicable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>George Bush came of age in the 19 </v>

290
00:12:50.471 --> 00:12:54.370
<v Speaker 2>fifties to have economic growth if we </v>
<v Speaker 2>don't take care of our deficit first.</v>

291
00:12:54.370 --> 00:12:57.600
<v Speaker 2>And that was the defensive position.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Avantis and Howard and Nixon.</v>

292
00:12:58.120 --> 00:13:00.250
<v Speaker 2>Kennedy saw that and saw an opening and </v>
<v Speaker 2>ran with it.</v>

293
00:13:00.370 --> 00:13:01.203
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what was the beginning of the </v>

294
00:13:03.190 --> 00:13:06.130
<v Speaker 2>presidency like when I watch all of </v>
<v Speaker 2>these documentaries now,</v>

295
00:13:06.370 --> 00:13:07.203
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they talk so much about the family and </v>

296
00:13:08.771 --> 00:13:09.604
<v Speaker 2>that there was this feeling of this </v>
<v Speaker 2>young person in the office and all of </v>

297
00:13:12.280 --> 00:13:14.170
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I suspect there was more to it than just</v>

298
00:13:14.171 --> 00:13:15.110
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

299
00:13:15.111 --> 00:13:17.650
<v Speaker 2>So when Kennedy was elected in November </v>
<v Speaker 2>19,</v>

300
00:13:17.651 --> 00:13:18.484
<v Speaker 2>60,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the United States that just tipped into </v>

301
00:13:19.721 --> 00:13:20.554
<v Speaker 2>a recession and there were mass layoffs </v>
<v Speaker 2>and hundreds of thousands in October </v>

302
00:13:23.441 --> 00:13:27.790
<v Speaker 2>probably delivered in the election when </v>
<v Speaker 2>that Sorenson has advised with certainly</v>

303
00:13:27.791 --> 00:13:28.624
<v Speaker 2>thought.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So and then unemployment went all the </v>

304
00:13:29.861 --> 00:13:30.694
<v Speaker 2>way up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>increased up to $5 million by night by </v>

305
00:13:32.440 --> 00:13:34.660
<v Speaker 2>January 1961.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So when you kind of,</v>

306
00:13:34.661 --> 00:13:35.494
<v Speaker 2>you know what that percentage was just </v>
<v Speaker 2>for reference to five percent now it </v>

307
00:13:38.970 --> 00:13:39.820
<v Speaker 2>doesn't sound like that.</v>

308
00:13:39.820 --> 00:13:42.550
<v Speaker 2>What will 5 million,</v>
<v Speaker 2>5 million the workforce,</v>

309
00:13:42.760 --> 00:13:43.593
<v Speaker 2>the unemployment rate was probably going</v>
<v Speaker 2>up to about eight percent at that point </v>

310
00:13:47.891 --> 00:13:49.270
<v Speaker 2>I'd have to check,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but probably around there.</v>

311
00:13:49.790 --> 00:13:52.210
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so Kennedy took office,</v>

312
00:13:52.240 --> 00:13:54.120
<v Speaker 2>submits a snow storm of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

313
00:13:54.130 --> 00:13:56.530
<v Speaker 2>That just ended it before his inaugural </v>
<v Speaker 2>address,</v>

314
00:13:56.560 --> 00:13:57.393
<v Speaker 2>famous inaugural address.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the big problem was there's now a </v>

315
00:14:01.811 --> 00:14:06.340
<v Speaker 2>new recession and then when he gave his </v>
<v Speaker 2>State of the Union address 10 days later</v>

316
00:14:06.550 --> 00:14:08.720
<v Speaker 2>in January of 1961,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

317
00:14:09.160 --> 00:14:14.020
<v Speaker 2>he kind of had a lot of kind of </v>
<v Speaker 2>equivalence equivocal statements.</v>

318
00:14:14.021 --> 00:14:16.640
<v Speaker 2>He said we have to get our house in </v>
<v Speaker 2>order.</v>

319
00:14:16.641 --> 00:14:18.460
<v Speaker 2>We have yet our country moving again and</v>
<v Speaker 2>we have,</v>

320
00:14:18.520 --> 00:14:20.380
<v Speaker 2>the government has to spend a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 2>money.</v>

321
00:14:20.920 --> 00:14:21.753
<v Speaker 2>So we kind of laid out two options.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We have to kind of get the government </v>

322
00:14:24.101 --> 00:14:26.470
<v Speaker 2>more efficient but also get the </v>
<v Speaker 2>government spending a lot of money.</v>

323
00:14:26.471 --> 00:14:28.660
<v Speaker 2>So it was unclear what he was going to </v>
<v Speaker 2>do.</v>

324
00:14:28.900 --> 00:14:30.760
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What does that even mean?</v>

325
00:14:30.761 --> 00:14:32.410
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do you think he knew at the time because</v>

326
00:14:32.411 --> 00:14:35.260
<v Speaker 2>those sound like statements that can't </v>
<v Speaker 2>work together.</v>

327
00:14:35.890 --> 00:14:38.080
<v Speaker 2>Richard Reeves,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who's his greatest biographer,</v>

328
00:14:38.180 --> 00:14:40.150
<v Speaker 2>he wrote the great book on Kennedy in </v>
<v Speaker 2>Nineteen Ninety two.</v>

329
00:14:40.270 --> 00:14:42.190
<v Speaker 2>President Kennedy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He said,</v>

330
00:14:42.191 --> 00:14:42.390
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

331
00:14:42.390 --> 00:14:43.990
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What Kennedy liked to do,</v>

332
00:14:44.320 --> 00:14:46.690
<v Speaker 2>and I think this is true,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we have all the Kennedy tapes.</v>

333
00:14:46.691 --> 00:14:47.524
<v Speaker 2>We can hear him on audio that John F </v>
<v Speaker 2>Kennedy Library has an amazing things </v>

334
00:14:51.050 --> 00:14:54.080
<v Speaker 2>online.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We can hear so much from Kennedy's voice</v>

335
00:14:54.081 --> 00:14:54.914
<v Speaker 2>privately.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's pretty clear that he thought </v>

336
00:14:57.111 --> 00:15:02.111
<v Speaker 2>himself kind of the Uber intellectual.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not a philosophical intellectual,</v>

337
00:15:03.051 --> 00:15:03.884
<v Speaker 2>but somebody who could process thoughts </v>
<v Speaker 2>and he would get a lot of good advice </v>

338
00:15:07.130 --> 00:15:09.920
<v Speaker 2>and then pick the best option.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's the way he would operate.</v>

339
00:15:09.921 --> 00:15:10.754
<v Speaker 2>He wasn't gonna figure it out himself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was going to wait and see and then </v>

340
00:15:13.431 --> 00:15:14.540
<v Speaker 2>make a strategic decision.</v>

341
00:15:14.570 --> 00:15:15.403
<v Speaker 2>So you think when he brought up those </v>
<v Speaker 2>seemingly conflicting ideas that he </v>

342
00:15:17.541 --> 00:15:20.060
<v Speaker 2>actually did mean it and that eventually</v>
<v Speaker 2>you could pick one.</v>

343
00:15:20.061 --> 00:15:22.880
<v Speaker 2>You would whittle it away with the right</v>
<v Speaker 2>people behind it.</v>

344
00:15:23.090 --> 00:15:25.370
<v Speaker 2>And now this sort of gets to what your </v>
<v Speaker 2>book was about.</v>

345
00:15:25.371 --> 00:15:28.780
<v Speaker 2>Which one did he end up going for?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was this good.</v>

346
00:15:29.150 --> 00:15:31.040
<v Speaker 2>He went for both.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

347
00:15:31.041 --> 00:15:33.860
<v Speaker 2>So Larry Kudlow and I wrote this book a </v>
<v Speaker 2>Jeff Can,</v>

348
00:15:33.861 --> 00:15:35.960
<v Speaker 2>the Reagan Revolution about the John F </v>
<v Speaker 2>Kennedy tax cut.</v>

349
00:15:35.961 --> 00:15:36.794
<v Speaker 2>And the big reason is what Larry,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my co author has had to deal with for </v>

350
00:15:40.221 --> 00:15:41.420
<v Speaker 2>15,</v>
<v Speaker 2>20 years.</v>

351
00:15:41.870 --> 00:15:45.230
<v Speaker 2>He gets this at parties from the likes </v>
<v Speaker 2>of people like Caroline Kennedy.</v>

352
00:15:45.231 --> 00:15:47.780
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he gets it on television and CNBC.</v>

353
00:15:48.170 --> 00:15:49.003
<v Speaker 2>How dare you say that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>The John F Kennedy tax cut had anything </v>

354
00:15:51.441 --> 00:15:52.274
<v Speaker 2>to do with the ragging tax cut because </v>
<v Speaker 2>that tax cut was designed by Keynesians </v>

355
00:15:55.610 --> 00:15:58.430
<v Speaker 2>in order to stimulate demand in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>economy.</v>

356
00:15:59.150 --> 00:16:00.350
<v Speaker 2>And Larry's out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think so.</v>

357
00:16:00.680 --> 00:16:02.210
<v Speaker 2>And he's right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All right.</v>

358
00:16:02.211 --> 00:16:03.640
<v Speaker 2>Wait,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's pause for just a second though.</v>

359
00:16:03.650 --> 00:16:05.870
<v Speaker 2>Can you tell me a little bit about the </v>
<v Speaker 2>tax cut specifically?</v>

360
00:16:06.030 --> 00:16:07.250
<v Speaker 2>So we have the framework.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

361
00:16:07.251 --> 00:16:10.910
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there was a tax cut in 1964.</v>

362
00:16:10.970 --> 00:16:13.760
<v Speaker 2>So after Kennedy's president of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>after Kennedy died,</v>

363
00:16:14.120 --> 00:16:14.953
<v Speaker 2>that was his brainchild and that </v>
<v Speaker 2>actually was his main legislative </v>

364
00:16:18.111 --> 00:16:22.100
<v Speaker 2>accomplishment,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he was president for a thousand days</v>

365
00:16:22.940 --> 00:16:23.773
<v Speaker 2>and he didn't get anything done really </v>
<v Speaker 2>on the economy until he introduced that </v>

366
00:16:29.001 --> 00:16:32.600
<v Speaker 2>tax cut in 1963.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So in 61 and 62,</v>

367
00:16:32.630 --> 00:16:36.200
<v Speaker 2>he was doing his famous vacillating.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's when he was thinking about,</v>

368
00:16:36.201 --> 00:16:36.781
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the canes,</v>

369
00:16:36.781 --> 00:16:40.970
<v Speaker 2>yours is saying we need loose money from</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Federal Reserve and we need a lot of</v>

370
00:16:40.971 --> 00:16:41.804
<v Speaker 2>social programs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he was experimenting with that </v>

371
00:16:45.050 --> 00:16:45.950
<v Speaker 2>forecast.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Came in,</v>

372
00:16:45.951 --> 00:16:48.260
<v Speaker 2>there's going to be another recession.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He pulled back and said,</v>

373
00:16:48.261 --> 00:16:49.670
<v Speaker 2>wait,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we need some more deep thinking.</v>

374
00:16:49.970 --> 00:16:51.170
<v Speaker 2>Keynesian said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>keep doing it.</v>

375
00:16:51.171 --> 00:16:52.610
<v Speaker 2>But then pulled in other people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What do you say?</v>

376
00:16:52.611 --> 00:16:54.110
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we need a big marginal tax cut.</v>

377
00:16:54.650 --> 00:16:55.483
<v Speaker 2>I get it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When the stock market crashed in April </v>

378
00:16:56.691 --> 00:16:57.524
<v Speaker 2>19,</v>
<v Speaker 2>62,</v>

379
00:16:57.650 --> 00:16:58.670
<v Speaker 2>June 19,</v>
<v Speaker 2>62,</v>

380
00:16:58.671 --> 00:16:59.504
<v Speaker 2>he said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

381
00:16:59.510 --> 00:17:00.343
<v Speaker 2>we need a big marginal tax gut.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How powerful was the presidency at this </v>

382
00:17:03.261 --> 00:17:03.681
<v Speaker 2>time?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

383
00:17:03.681 --> 00:17:04.514
<v Speaker 2>one of the things that we talk about on </v>
<v Speaker 2>this show a lot is just that the </v>

384
00:17:06.081 --> 00:17:06.914
<v Speaker 2>executive branch just keeps getting more</v>
<v Speaker 2>power and more power and does all this </v>

385
00:17:09.501 --> 00:17:11.720
<v Speaker 2>stuff via executive action.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A lot of this,</v>

386
00:17:11.721 --> 00:17:14.030
<v Speaker 2>when you hear about it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think the average person thinks,</v>

387
00:17:14.031 --> 00:17:14.864
<v Speaker 2>wait a minute,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is it the president's job really to be </v>

388
00:17:16.551 --> 00:17:18.080
<v Speaker 2>doing all this?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is it he's supposed to sign.</v>

389
00:17:18.081 --> 00:17:18.914
<v Speaker 2>The law is not really making the laws,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's interesting on that score is </v>

390
00:17:22.611 --> 00:17:23.444
<v Speaker 2>the John f Kennedy was actually not </v>
<v Speaker 2>terribly interested in making unique </v>

391
00:17:27.651 --> 00:17:28.484
<v Speaker 2>executive actions actually with each of </v>
<v Speaker 2>his executive sign it signing up </v>

392
00:17:31.900 --> 00:17:32.360
<v Speaker 2>signings.</v>

393
00:17:32.360 --> 00:17:33.193
<v Speaker 2>He had these signing statements that </v>
<v Speaker 2>went on and on and on about how he </v>

394
00:17:35.590 --> 00:17:38.700
<v Speaker 2>justified his signature was sometimes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now we did.</v>

395
00:17:38.701 --> 00:17:41.240
<v Speaker 2>They just sign it right now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just no know he paddled up.</v>

396
00:17:42.690 --> 00:17:45.130
<v Speaker 2>Signature back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So good.</v>

397
00:17:45.570 --> 00:17:46.880
<v Speaker 2>I think that's the residence.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

398
00:17:47.990 --> 00:17:48.823
<v Speaker 2>so he actually rejected a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>an executive authority that his liberal </v>

399
00:17:53.251 --> 00:17:54.084
<v Speaker 2>advisors were imploring him to take him </v>
<v Speaker 2>and that was his liberal advantage and </v>

400
00:17:58.500 --> 00:18:00.990
<v Speaker 2>say you should have a standby tax cut </v>
<v Speaker 2>authority.</v>

401
00:18:01.260 --> 00:18:02.093
<v Speaker 2>You should have the authority as </v>
<v Speaker 2>president just to reduce taxes on your </v>

402
00:18:04.351 --> 00:18:06.930
<v Speaker 2>own for a period of time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe up to 18 months.</v>

403
00:18:07.170 --> 00:18:09.300
<v Speaker 2>So if the economy starts tipping into </v>
<v Speaker 2>recession,</v>

404
00:18:09.301 --> 00:18:10.134
<v Speaker 2>you can just sign a piece of paper and </v>
<v Speaker 2>everyone's taxes will go down and we'll </v>

405
00:18:12.121 --> 00:18:15.120
<v Speaker 2>get out of recession.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then if inflation starts going up or</v>

406
00:18:15.121 --> 00:18:18.150
<v Speaker 2>overheating then you can take it away </v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's effective.</v>

407
00:18:18.510 --> 00:18:19.650
<v Speaker 2>And Kennedy said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

408
00:18:20.160 --> 00:18:22.410
<v Speaker 2>I'm not going to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's interesting.</v>

409
00:18:23.110 --> 00:18:27.340
<v Speaker 1>So I always described Kennedy as my kind</v>
<v Speaker 1>of Democrat.</v>

410
00:18:27.370 --> 00:18:29.620
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I talk a lot about how the left has sort</v>

411
00:18:29.621 --> 00:18:30.454
<v Speaker 1>of lost its way and it's lost its </v>
<v Speaker 1>classical liberal roots and they've </v>

412
00:18:33.431 --> 00:18:37.300
<v Speaker 1>picked progressivism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>big government over liberalism.</v>

413
00:18:38.050 --> 00:18:40.120
<v Speaker 1>Do you think his political ethos,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

414
00:18:40.121 --> 00:18:40.954
<v Speaker 1>from everything I'm hearing from you so </v>
<v Speaker 1>far was he basically came from a </v>

415
00:18:43.271 --> 00:18:45.490
<v Speaker 1>classical liberal line of thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

416
00:18:45.491 --> 00:18:46.660
<v Speaker 1>Is that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that fair to say?</v>

417
00:18:46.730 --> 00:18:47.511
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

418
00:18:47.511 --> 00:18:49.050
<v Speaker 2>Ken Kennedy ultimately</v>

419
00:18:49.070 --> 00:18:51.650
<v Speaker 1>it sounds like there was definitely some</v>
<v Speaker 1>play on both sides.</v>

420
00:18:51.651 --> 00:18:51.820
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

421
00:18:51.820 --> 00:18:52.653
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Kennedy ultimately did some very good </v>

422
00:18:55.061 --> 00:18:57.250
<v Speaker 2>things as precedent above all the tax </v>
<v Speaker 2>code.</v>

423
00:18:57.310 --> 00:18:58.143
<v Speaker 2>You could argue the civil rights act </v>
<v Speaker 2>even though like I still kind of think </v>

424
00:19:00.551 --> 00:19:01.384
<v Speaker 2>and Kennedy believed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and we can talk about this later if you </v>

425
00:19:02.931 --> 00:19:04.660
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that if the tax got,</v>

426
00:19:04.661 --> 00:19:08.080
<v Speaker 2>had just happened,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the civil rights,</v>

427
00:19:08.081 --> 00:19:10.090
<v Speaker 2>that would have been unnecessary.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We can talk about that later.</v>

428
00:19:10.870 --> 00:19:13.360
<v Speaker 2>The thing though about Kennedy's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was kind of a wild man.</v>

429
00:19:13.450 --> 00:19:17.420
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was a rich wildman and um,</v>

430
00:19:18.130 --> 00:19:21.760
<v Speaker 2>I don't know how useful that </v>
<v Speaker 2>particularly is in our political life.</v>

431
00:19:22.360 --> 00:19:25.510
<v Speaker 2>His father was kind of crazy about what </v>
<v Speaker 2>he did,</v>

432
00:19:25.540 --> 00:19:26.373
<v Speaker 2>how he felt he could influence politics </v>
<v Speaker 2>and his son was kind of a chip off the </v>

433
00:19:30.161 --> 00:19:32.260
<v Speaker 2>old block,</v>
<v Speaker 2>although his son was incapable of making</v>

434
00:19:32.261 --> 00:19:34.470
<v Speaker 2>money unlike his father.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

435
00:19:34.500 --> 00:19:35.333
<v Speaker 2>but they were both pretty wild people in</v>
<v Speaker 2>kind of in charge of the United States </v>

436
00:19:38.171 --> 00:19:39.004
<v Speaker 2>government.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That might be an argument for shrinking </v>

437
00:19:39.701 --> 00:19:40.200
<v Speaker 2>government.</v>

438
00:19:40.200 --> 00:19:40.811
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

439
00:19:40.811 --> 00:19:41.970
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so when you say wild,</v>

440
00:19:41.971 --> 00:19:45.030
<v Speaker 1>I mean we hear all kinds of stories and </v>
<v Speaker 1>rumors and all this and that.</v>

441
00:19:45.031 --> 00:19:45.620
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what are you,</v>

442
00:19:45.620 --> 00:19:47.790
<v Speaker 1>what are you saying wild is or was?</v>

443
00:19:47.850 --> 00:19:48.840
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

444
00:19:49.080 --> 00:19:52.440
<v Speaker 2>we at Larry and I talked a bit about a </v>
<v Speaker 2>girl.</v>

445
00:19:52.441 --> 00:19:53.274
<v Speaker 2>He dated,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a woman named Margaret [inaudible] who </v>

446
00:19:55.591 --> 00:19:59.380
<v Speaker 2>won the Pulitzer Prize in biography and </v>
<v Speaker 2>history sort of biography,</v>

447
00:19:59.381 --> 00:20:01.860
<v Speaker 2>a great biography of John Calhoun,</v>
<v Speaker 2>1950.</v>

448
00:20:01.861 --> 00:20:02.694
<v Speaker 2>And when the pills surprise then Kenny </v>
<v Speaker 2>wanted to get to network because he </v>

449
00:20:04.561 --> 00:20:05.970
<v Speaker 2>wanted to win,</v>
<v Speaker 2>appealed surprise too.</v>

450
00:20:06.570 --> 00:20:10.350
<v Speaker 2>And we have her recollections of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>time when she dated Kennedy right before</v>

451
00:20:10.680 --> 00:20:11.513
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

452
00:20:11.690 --> 00:20:15.000
<v Speaker 2>he proposed to Jackie in 1953 and she </v>
<v Speaker 2>said,</v>

453
00:20:15.001 --> 00:20:15.834
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he'd just drive around in the convert </v>

454
00:20:17.520 --> 00:20:18.353
<v Speaker 2>convertible and making sure he was </v>
<v Speaker 2>staying on the street car tracks and </v>

455
00:20:21.500 --> 00:20:24.660
<v Speaker 2>just annoying people on the road.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he was saying,</v>

456
00:20:24.720 --> 00:20:25.880
<v Speaker 2>I want to do this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to do this.</v>

457
00:20:25.910 --> 00:20:28.050
<v Speaker 2>I just realized this guy's just a little</v>
<v Speaker 2>bit out of my league.</v>

458
00:20:28.680 --> 00:20:32.220
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was a force of nature.</v>

459
00:20:32.880 --> 00:20:34.760
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so all right,</v>

460
00:20:34.770 --> 00:20:36.510
<v Speaker 2>there are some people who are forces of </v>
<v Speaker 2>nature.</v>

461
00:20:36.840 --> 00:20:40.320
<v Speaker 2>So I just think from a certain </v>
<v Speaker 2>perspective that might be a reason if we</v>

462
00:20:40.321 --> 00:20:41.154
<v Speaker 2>have government to make sure that if we </v>
<v Speaker 2>have those people at the top of </v>

463
00:20:43.321 --> 00:20:44.730
<v Speaker 2>government,</v>
<v Speaker 2>government should be small.</v>

464
00:20:46.060 --> 00:20:47.830
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to do a lot on the taxes and I do</v>

465
00:20:47.831 --> 00:20:48.010
<v Speaker 1>want to</v>

466
00:20:48.010 --> 00:20:48.843
<v Speaker 2>get to civil rights,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we should back up a little bit </v>

467
00:20:49.840 --> 00:20:51.340
<v Speaker 2>because I haven't mentioned Jackie at </v>
<v Speaker 2>all.</v>

468
00:20:51.341 --> 00:20:53.710
<v Speaker 2>I actually just watched the movie with </v>
<v Speaker 2>Natalie Portman.</v>

469
00:20:54.010 --> 00:20:54.843
<v Speaker 2>I thought it was excellent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What do we need to know about their </v>

470
00:20:56.621 --> 00:20:58.090
<v Speaker 2>relationship,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the courtship.</v>

471
00:20:58.091 --> 00:20:59.890
<v Speaker 2>And then the amount of power that she </v>
<v Speaker 2>had,</v>

472
00:20:59.891 --> 00:21:03.430
<v Speaker 2>or at least the uncomfortability with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with being the first lady,</v>

473
00:21:03.431 --> 00:21:05.890
<v Speaker 2>and then subsequently after,</v>
<v Speaker 2>after he was assassinated,</v>

474
00:21:06.280 --> 00:21:09.290
<v Speaker 2>Jackie,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm the first guy who proposed to Jack.</v>

475
00:21:09.291 --> 00:21:14.290
<v Speaker 2>He just died a year or two ago in his </v>
<v Speaker 2>home on Nantucket in Massachusetts.</v>

476
00:21:14.350 --> 00:21:18.400
<v Speaker 2>And Jackie turned down his proposal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is in 1951 or 52,</v>

477
00:21:18.420 --> 00:21:20.470
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because she and her mother did not think</v>

478
00:21:20.471 --> 00:21:21.304
<v Speaker 2>that he would end up being rich enough </v>
<v Speaker 2>and I point out that he'd died on </v>

479
00:21:23.951 --> 00:21:26.680
<v Speaker 2>nantucket.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I think she was right.</v>

480
00:21:26.740 --> 00:21:28.990
<v Speaker 2>Even he was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>would not have been rich enough.</v>

481
00:21:29.010 --> 00:21:29.550
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

482
00:21:29.550 --> 00:21:31.000
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that Jackie,</v>

483
00:21:31.030 --> 00:21:31.863
<v Speaker 2>and that's hard to believe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but people don't really understand what </v>

484
00:21:33.851 --> 00:21:36.060
<v Speaker 2>that sort of northeast,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

485
00:21:36.120 --> 00:21:36.910
<v Speaker 2>what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what do you call that?</v>

486
00:21:36.910 --> 00:21:38.410
<v Speaker 2>It's not even a lead.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's something else,</v>

487
00:21:38.411 --> 00:21:39.450
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just that,</v>

488
00:21:39.451 --> 00:21:40.284
<v Speaker 2>that family dynasty the thing where </v>
<v Speaker 2>these people really were connected with </v>

489
00:21:43.961 --> 00:21:47.260
<v Speaker 2>other people for the purposes of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of politics and power.</v>

490
00:21:47.261 --> 00:21:48.550
<v Speaker 2>It's hard.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's hard to believe it.</v>

491
00:21:48.551 --> 00:21:50.640
<v Speaker 2>I think in modern sense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

492
00:21:51.280 --> 00:21:54.670
<v Speaker 2>but I think what really calm Jackie </v>
<v Speaker 2>down,</v>

493
00:21:54.671 --> 00:21:55.504
<v Speaker 2>they were a great love match.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think there's any dispute about </v>

494
00:21:57.221 --> 00:21:58.054
<v Speaker 2>that Jack and Jackie,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but what really settled Jackie was </v>

495
00:22:01.901 --> 00:22:05.650
<v Speaker 2>Joseph piece wealth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jackie really adored Jeff Case.</v>

496
00:22:05.651 --> 00:22:08.280
<v Speaker 2>Father adored him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

497
00:22:08.500 --> 00:22:10.780
<v Speaker 2>and his $400,000,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>calmed her down.</v>

498
00:22:11.170 --> 00:22:14.890
<v Speaker 2>So I think that was at the absolute glue</v>
<v Speaker 2>that kept them together.</v>

499
00:22:14.930 --> 00:22:16.870
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And she came from a lot of money,</v>

500
00:22:16.871 --> 00:22:17.704
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

501
00:22:17.710 --> 00:22:19.330
<v Speaker 2>the movie has had money.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

502
00:22:19.331 --> 00:22:20.160
<v Speaker 2>They,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

503
00:22:20.160 --> 00:22:20.993
<v Speaker 2>then there's a divorce and she was </v>
<v Speaker 2>married and she had brought into the </v>

504
00:22:23.471 --> 00:22:25.610
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible] family,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which was very involved.</v>

505
00:22:25.611 --> 00:22:26.444
<v Speaker 2>The senator from New Jersey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all class representative who voted for </v>

506
00:22:28.541 --> 00:22:31.080
<v Speaker 2>the Kennedy tax cut in 1960,</v>
<v Speaker 2>19 sixties.</v>

507
00:22:31.350 --> 00:22:33.460
<v Speaker 2>Lewis,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the famous novelist,</v>

508
00:22:33.940 --> 00:22:35.200
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they,</v>

509
00:22:35.250 --> 00:22:36.083
<v Speaker 2>they had been harmed by the 1929 crisis </v>
<v Speaker 2>and the Kennedy family had been </v>

510
00:22:40.750 --> 00:22:41.583
<v Speaker 2>immensely enriched by the 1929 crisis.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there was a big wealth gap between </v>

511
00:22:45.280 --> 00:22:47.680
<v Speaker 2>those families.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So everything that I've seen about,</v>

512
00:22:47.681 --> 00:22:50.860
<v Speaker 2>or I haven't read much about her,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I've watched grey gardens,</v>

513
00:22:51.450 --> 00:22:52.283
<v Speaker 2>the Jackie Moody and everything that she</v>
<v Speaker 2>really struggled with the public nature </v>

514
00:22:56.201 --> 00:22:57.034
<v Speaker 2>of this really from day one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But she also knew what she was marrying </v>

515
00:22:59.531 --> 00:23:00.364
<v Speaker 2>into.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is that just a little bit about the </v>

516
00:23:01.541 --> 00:23:03.610
<v Speaker 2>complexity of her character?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

517
00:23:03.640 --> 00:23:05.470
<v Speaker 2>Jackie was this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No question.</v>

518
00:23:05.471 --> 00:23:06.304
<v Speaker 2>She was a sophisticated person.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean she spoke French and Spanish and </v>

519
00:23:09.851 --> 00:23:14.710
<v Speaker 2>all that because she was interested in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the ways of the world and she really was</v>

520
00:23:14.711 --> 00:23:18.310
<v Speaker 2>one of the most remarkable fashion </v>
<v Speaker 2>plates in all of history.</v>

521
00:23:18.760 --> 00:23:21.850
<v Speaker 2>And she stepped into those roles very </v>
<v Speaker 2>well.</v>

522
00:23:21.851 --> 00:23:24.340
<v Speaker 2>So yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she was shy.</v>

523
00:23:24.340 --> 00:23:27.810
<v Speaker 2>She has that little voice that you can </v>
<v Speaker 2>vary the amount very barely here.</v>

524
00:23:28.280 --> 00:23:29.113
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but she also understood what her </v>

525
00:23:30.341 --> 00:23:31.174
<v Speaker 2>potential was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Her potential was to be an ambassador </v>

526
00:23:33.941 --> 00:23:36.320
<v Speaker 2>for civilization and she stepped into </v>
<v Speaker 2>that very,</v>

527
00:23:36.350 --> 00:23:37.900
<v Speaker 2>very willingly and it's good that she </v>
<v Speaker 2>did.</v>

528
00:23:38.290 --> 00:23:39.670
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So now let's jump back,</v>

529
00:23:39.680 --> 00:23:40.513
<v Speaker 2>renew a little more on her,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but then now let's jump back to those </v>

530
00:23:41.591 --> 00:23:42.424
<v Speaker 2>tax cuts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you're saying the JFK put those tax </v>

531
00:23:44.651 --> 00:23:46.940
<v Speaker 2>cuts into place 62,</v>
<v Speaker 2>63,</v>

532
00:23:46.941 --> 00:23:49.670
<v Speaker 2>but then they weren't enacted until </v>
<v Speaker 2>after he was gone.</v>

533
00:23:50.150 --> 00:23:53.060
<v Speaker 2>So tell me a little bit more about that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What happened is they didn't split those</v>

534
00:23:53.061 --> 00:23:54.620
<v Speaker 2>tax cuts in place,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm afraid.</v>

535
00:23:54.621 --> 00:23:55.454
<v Speaker 2>And 61 and 62,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he listened to his liberal advisors who </v>

536
00:23:57.681 --> 00:23:58.514
<v Speaker 2>said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we have to concentrate on government </v>

537
00:23:59.391 --> 00:24:01.640
<v Speaker 2>spending,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hold off on tax cuts.</v>

538
00:24:01.730 --> 00:24:03.140
<v Speaker 2>Let's just concentrate on government </v>
<v Speaker 2>spending.</v>

539
00:24:03.290 --> 00:24:07.610
<v Speaker 2>Let's get loose money from the Fed and </v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe welfare programs spend on national</v>

540
00:24:07.611 --> 00:24:08.050
<v Speaker 2>parks.</v>

541
00:24:08.050 --> 00:24:11.850
<v Speaker 2>I'd post offices all bunch of stuff and </v>
<v Speaker 2>that will stave off for session,</v>

542
00:24:11.940 --> 00:24:13.520
<v Speaker 2>that'll stave it off,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that'll stave it off.</v>

543
00:24:13.521 --> 00:24:18.521
<v Speaker 2>And if we invest in education and </v>
<v Speaker 2>hospitals and Medicare and welfare,</v>

544
00:24:19.100 --> 00:24:22.160
<v Speaker 2>the economy will grow because of that </v>
<v Speaker 2>government investment.</v>

545
00:24:22.430 --> 00:24:24.620
<v Speaker 2>That was the argument of his liberal </v>
<v Speaker 2>advisors.</v>

546
00:24:24.621 --> 00:24:27.470
<v Speaker 2>Kennedy did that for the first year and </v>
<v Speaker 2>a half.</v>

547
00:24:28.130 --> 00:24:29.450
<v Speaker 2>All the forecasts came in and said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

548
00:24:29.451 --> 00:24:31.430
<v Speaker 2>there's gonna be another recession.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's been.</v>

549
00:24:31.460 --> 00:24:34.070
<v Speaker 2>There were four recessions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The 1950 to 1949,</v>

550
00:24:34.640 --> 00:24:36.320
<v Speaker 2>50 4:57</v>
<v Speaker 2>60,</v>

551
00:24:36.420 --> 00:24:39.140
<v Speaker 2>let me a fifth and 13 years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Every 24 months,</v>

552
00:24:39.141 --> 00:24:40.640
<v Speaker 2>36 months,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's going to be a recession.</v>

553
00:24:41.090 --> 00:24:44.870
<v Speaker 2>When the stock market went down 30 </v>
<v Speaker 2>percent in the spring of 1962,</v>

554
00:24:45.260 --> 00:24:47.690
<v Speaker 2>Kennedy said they made another </v>
<v Speaker 2>recession.</v>

555
00:24:47.780 --> 00:24:50.060
<v Speaker 2>I am going to be so run out of office.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not funny.</v>

556
00:24:50.450 --> 00:24:51.283
<v Speaker 2>We're going to switch gears here and </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's when he gave his commencement </v>

557
00:24:53.691 --> 00:24:54.524
<v Speaker 2>speech at Yale in June of 19,</v>
<v Speaker 2>62 saying we have to think about </v>

558
00:24:57.651 --> 00:24:58.484
<v Speaker 2>reversing our policy mix towards tight </v>
<v Speaker 2>money to protect the dollar in tax cuts </v>

559
00:25:02.571 --> 00:25:04.940
<v Speaker 2>to expand the economy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then what happened?</v>

560
00:25:04.940 --> 00:25:07.560
<v Speaker 2>What was the result then is liberal </v>
<v Speaker 2>advisors said,</v>

561
00:25:07.561 --> 00:25:07.780
<v Speaker 2>Whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whoa,</v>

562
00:25:07.780 --> 00:25:08.361
<v Speaker 2>Whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wait,</v>

563
00:25:08.361 --> 00:25:08.691
<v Speaker 2>wait,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wait,</v>

564
00:25:08.691 --> 00:25:09.710
<v Speaker 2>wait.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's going great though.</v>

565
00:25:09.711 --> 00:25:11.310
<v Speaker 2>Listen to that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're going to do this.</v>

566
00:25:11.560 --> 00:25:12.393
<v Speaker 2>Their argument though,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at that point when they were looking at </v>

567
00:25:13.461 --> 00:25:14.294
<v Speaker 2>the numbers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what,</v>

568
00:25:14.360 --> 00:25:15.193
<v Speaker 2>what was the argument was purely like </v>
<v Speaker 2>operating on a philosophical level and </v>

569
00:25:18.011 --> 00:25:20.390
<v Speaker 2>then you just keep throwing money at the</v>
<v Speaker 2>government and these programs.</v>

570
00:25:20.391 --> 00:25:22.440
<v Speaker 2>They waves academic articles.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had,</v>

571
00:25:22.550 --> 00:25:23.383
<v Speaker 2>they had Paul Samuelson at Mit and </v>
<v Speaker 2>Robert Solow to future Nobel prize </v>

572
00:25:26.781 --> 00:25:30.110
<v Speaker 2>winners who was a staff and the council </v>
<v Speaker 2>of economic advisors saying,</v>

573
00:25:30.410 --> 00:25:31.940
<v Speaker 2>Oh no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we've come up with this thing called the</v>

574
00:25:31.941 --> 00:25:35.840
<v Speaker 2>neoclassical synthesis that says if you </v>
<v Speaker 2>have really loose money from the Fed,</v>

575
00:25:36.200 --> 00:25:39.110
<v Speaker 2>that will get the economy moving.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Don't worry about inflation.</v>

576
00:25:39.111 --> 00:25:39.944
<v Speaker 2>You can mop it up with high tax rates </v>
<v Speaker 2>and then the revenue you get can fund </v>

577
00:25:44.360 --> 00:25:48.680
<v Speaker 2>programs in education,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in healthcare that will help the economy</v>

578
00:25:48.681 --> 00:25:49.330
<v Speaker 2>grow.</v>

579
00:25:49.330 --> 00:25:50.163
<v Speaker 2>It was just stick to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I forget about those forecasts for </v>

580
00:25:51.291 --> 00:25:52.160
<v Speaker 2>recession,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that,</v>

581
00:25:52.161 --> 00:25:54.920
<v Speaker 2>that really reveals Kennedy's decision </v>
<v Speaker 2>making character.</v>

582
00:25:55.160 --> 00:25:56.060
<v Speaker 2>He listened,</v>
<v Speaker 2>listened,</v>

583
00:25:56.061 --> 00:25:57.050
<v Speaker 2>listened,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then just said,</v>

584
00:25:57.051 --> 00:25:58.100
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you guys are wrong.</v>

585
00:25:58.160 --> 00:26:00.080
<v Speaker 2>We're going to do the opposite.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's,</v>

586
00:26:00.081 --> 00:26:01.880
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's real decision making metal.</v>

587
00:26:02.030 --> 00:26:05.090
<v Speaker 2>So then aft in 64,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when these tax cuts go into place,</v>

588
00:26:05.120 --> 00:26:06.590
<v Speaker 2>then what was the result?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

589
00:26:06.620 --> 00:26:08.410
<v Speaker 2>so there's still a year and a half </v>
<v Speaker 2>there,</v>

590
00:26:08.420 --> 00:26:09.350
<v Speaker 2>if I may point out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

591
00:26:09.560 --> 00:26:10.393
<v Speaker 2>so then in July,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Kennedy started talking to his treasury </v>

592
00:26:13.011 --> 00:26:13.970
<v Speaker 2>secretary.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Big Time.</v>

593
00:26:13.971 --> 00:26:16.820
<v Speaker 2>Now he had communicated with them daily </v>
<v Speaker 2>on all sorts of matters.</v>

594
00:26:16.821 --> 00:26:18.980
<v Speaker 2>But Larry and I talk a lot about seed </v>
<v Speaker 2>Douglas Dillon,</v>

595
00:26:18.981 --> 00:26:20.870
<v Speaker 2>the unsung hero of the Kennedy </v>
<v Speaker 2>Administration,</v>

596
00:26:21.290 --> 00:26:23.270
<v Speaker 2>Justice Richard Chesapeake Kennedy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>by the way,</v>

597
00:26:23.520 --> 00:26:25.580
<v Speaker 2>I'm Kennedy's treasury secretary.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dylan said,</v>

598
00:26:25.840 --> 00:26:27.860
<v Speaker 2>you got to protect the dollar and cut </v>
<v Speaker 2>tax rates.</v>

599
00:26:27.920 --> 00:26:28.753
<v Speaker 2>That's what you gotta do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Kenny went on national television in </v>

600
00:26:30.561 --> 00:26:31.220
<v Speaker 2>August,</v>
<v Speaker 2>saying,</v>

601
00:26:31.220 --> 00:26:33.170
<v Speaker 2>by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's our policy.</v>

602
00:26:33.260 --> 00:26:35.390
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to introduce the bill in </v>
<v Speaker 2>Congress.</v>

603
00:26:35.510 --> 00:26:36.343
<v Speaker 2>He did that in January of [inaudible].</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sixty three big congressional debate </v>

604
00:26:38.960 --> 00:26:41.720
<v Speaker 2>almost got passed before the </v>
<v Speaker 2>assassination by that point,</v>

605
00:26:41.721 --> 00:26:42.554
<v Speaker 2>the markets and everyone else,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Kennedy serious about tax that and </v>

606
00:26:44.701 --> 00:26:46.620
<v Speaker 2>that's when the huge sixties boom </v>
<v Speaker 2>started.</v>

607
00:26:47.280 --> 00:26:49.650
<v Speaker 1>What did the parties think of this at </v>
<v Speaker 1>the time?</v>

608
00:26:49.651 --> 00:26:52.560
<v Speaker 1>Because if you think about it in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>context of 2018,</v>

609
00:26:52.760 --> 00:26:55.620
<v Speaker 1>the Democrats generally you are for </v>
<v Speaker 1>higher taxes.</v>

610
00:26:55.830 --> 00:26:58.620
<v Speaker 1>Republicans generally are for lower </v>
<v Speaker 1>taxes.</v>

611
00:26:58.621 --> 00:26:59.454
<v Speaker 1>So when Kennedy goes out there and </v>
<v Speaker 1>listens to the advice and says this was </v>

612
00:27:02.760 --> 00:27:04.100
<v Speaker 1>the party behind him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

613
00:27:04.500 --> 00:27:06.300
<v Speaker 1>Or am I looking at this only through our</v>
<v Speaker 1>2018?</v>

614
00:27:06.600 --> 00:27:07.080
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

615
00:27:07.080 --> 00:27:09.660
<v Speaker 2>this is news.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This bigness.</v>

616
00:27:09.730 --> 00:27:12.180
<v Speaker 2>Larry and I talk about this in the book </v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot.</v>

617
00:27:13.260 --> 00:27:18.260
<v Speaker 2>The party of tax rate cuts particularly </v>
<v Speaker 2>cuts on the top rate of income tax.</v>

618
00:27:18.511 --> 00:27:21.000
<v Speaker 2>The top one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now back then it was 91 percent.</v>

619
00:27:21.070 --> 00:27:23.850
<v Speaker 2>That's unbelievable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's really hard to fathom.</v>

620
00:27:23.851 --> 00:27:28.530
<v Speaker 2>On a top rate was 91 percent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's so hard to fathom that it has to be</v>

621
00:27:28.531 --> 00:27:30.390
<v Speaker 2>a joke and it wasn't true because nobody</v>
<v Speaker 2>paid it.</v>

622
00:27:30.420 --> 00:27:31.170
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's true.</v>

623
00:27:31.170 --> 00:27:32.340
<v Speaker 2>Nobody paid that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

624
00:27:32.420 --> 00:27:33.253
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe 20 percent of people who should </v>

625
00:27:34.780 --> 00:27:37.320
<v Speaker 2>been a red should have applied to pay </v>
<v Speaker 2>to.</v>

626
00:27:37.620 --> 00:27:40.950
<v Speaker 2>That's how many loopholes there were.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the Democrats said,</v>

627
00:27:40.951 --> 00:27:44.550
<v Speaker 2>you see these French guys,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what they're doing is they're buying off</v>

628
00:27:44.551 --> 00:27:46.500
<v Speaker 2>the tax system.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They climb,</v>

629
00:27:46.501 --> 00:27:47.334
<v Speaker 2>they're paying this rate,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then they get all these loopholes </v>

630
00:27:48.371 --> 00:27:49.204
<v Speaker 2>and they're hiding their money and we </v>
<v Speaker 2>get a recession every 24 months because </v>

631
00:27:51.361 --> 00:27:53.070
<v Speaker 2>capital is not deployed correctly.</v>

632
00:27:53.400 --> 00:27:55.020
<v Speaker 2>So it was the Democrats,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wilbur Mills,</v>

633
00:27:55.021 --> 00:27:55.854
<v Speaker 2>chairman of House Ways and means </v>
<v Speaker 2>committee in 1959 commissioned a huge </v>

634
00:27:58.381 --> 00:28:00.750
<v Speaker 2>2,500</v>
<v Speaker 2>page study on why we have to cut the top</v>

635
00:28:00.751 --> 00:28:03.690
<v Speaker 2>right of the income tax.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it was the Republicans who said,</v>

636
00:28:03.691 --> 00:28:04.860
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hold it.</v>

637
00:28:05.360 --> 00:28:06.870
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we know what to do.</v>

638
00:28:07.140 --> 00:28:08.800
<v Speaker 2>We,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if we say we need a loophole,</v>

639
00:28:08.820 --> 00:28:10.620
<v Speaker 2>give us a loophole.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're in charge here.</v>

640
00:28:10.920 --> 00:28:13.650
<v Speaker 2>So Republicans said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no tax rate cuts.</v>

641
00:28:13.651 --> 00:28:16.320
<v Speaker 2>The system's working fun in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Democrats said,</v>

642
00:28:16.321 --> 00:28:18.420
<v Speaker 2>tax rate cuts to get us out of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>cereal recession.</v>

643
00:28:18.900 --> 00:28:22.020
<v Speaker 2>What does that say about how things flip</v>
<v Speaker 2>over years in time?</v>

644
00:28:22.320 --> 00:28:24.630
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think first of all,</v>

645
00:28:24.631 --> 00:28:26.520
<v Speaker 2>we have to blame the Contemporary </v>
<v Speaker 2>Democrats,</v>

646
00:28:26.521 --> 00:28:28.590
<v Speaker 2>Democrats today,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the last 20 years.</v>

647
00:28:28.700 --> 00:28:29.533
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what are you doing for getting your </v>

648
00:28:31.021 --> 00:28:32.040
<v Speaker 2>legacy?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

649
00:28:32.041 --> 00:28:35.850
<v Speaker 2>we can go back to the 18 twenties to </v>
<v Speaker 2>realize that the founding of the party,</v>

650
00:28:36.060 --> 00:28:38.880
<v Speaker 2>it was about lowering top tax rates.</v>

651
00:28:39.120 --> 00:28:39.953
<v Speaker 2>When you talking about the tariff,</v>
<v Speaker 2>John Calhoun and Kennedy had a lot to </v>

652
00:28:42.451 --> 00:28:44.040
<v Speaker 2>say about calhoun through his girlfriend</v>
<v Speaker 2>Margaret.</v>

653
00:28:44.041 --> 00:28:48.240
<v Speaker 2>Quite galloon said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yet tariff rates hurt the little guy.</v>

654
00:28:48.690 --> 00:28:52.020
<v Speaker 2>And then grover Cleveland income tax </v>
<v Speaker 2>hurts the little guy.</v>

655
00:28:52.170 --> 00:28:53.003
<v Speaker 2>18 nineties woodrow Wilson after a </v>
<v Speaker 2>raised taxes had three treasury </v>

656
00:28:57.001 --> 00:28:59.730
<v Speaker 2>secretaries who said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these are completely scarifying.</v>

657
00:28:59.900 --> 00:29:00.733
<v Speaker 2>Let's lower them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're killing investment in this </v>

658
00:29:02.251 --> 00:29:03.084
<v Speaker 2>country for the little guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Really you can go through just about </v>

659
00:29:04.921 --> 00:29:07.020
<v Speaker 2>every Democratic president is cut tax </v>
<v Speaker 2>rates.</v>

660
00:29:07.170 --> 00:29:08.970
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bill Clinton cut the capital gains rate.</v>

661
00:29:09.090 --> 00:29:09.923
<v Speaker 2>Jimmy Carter cut the capital gains rate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Barack Obama was spooked by the </v>

662
00:29:13.021 --> 00:29:16.140
<v Speaker 2>exploration of the Bush tax cuts and he </v>
<v Speaker 2>kept them from one more year.</v>

663
00:29:16.440 --> 00:29:16.951
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

664
00:29:16.951 --> 00:29:19.140
<v Speaker 2>there's a long history of Democrats </v>
<v Speaker 2>getting the top right.</v>

665
00:29:19.260 --> 00:29:20.071
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So then,</v>

666
00:29:20.071 --> 00:29:21.240
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so 64.</v>

667
00:29:21.270 --> 00:29:24.420
<v Speaker 1>Now the economy starts going again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>k Kennedy's gone.</v>

668
00:29:24.990 --> 00:29:28.080
<v Speaker 1>Tell me a little bit more about the </v>
<v Speaker 1>legacy of that and then sort of how that</v>

669
00:29:28.081 --> 00:29:29.700
<v Speaker 1>got to Reagan and then we'll get it.</v>

670
00:29:29.870 --> 00:29:31.520
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Here's the basic,</v>

671
00:29:31.521 --> 00:29:32.450
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>inflection.</v>

672
00:29:32.451 --> 00:29:33.284
<v Speaker 2>Here are the basic numbers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The eight years of the Eisenhower </v>

673
00:29:36.090 --> 00:29:40.760
<v Speaker 2>presidency in 1953 to 1961 economic </v>
<v Speaker 2>growth was two point five percent.</v>

674
00:29:41.200 --> 00:29:42.033
<v Speaker 2>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's not good.</v>

675
00:29:42.040 --> 00:29:44.290
<v Speaker 2>Population growth than baby boom was two</v>
<v Speaker 2>point five percent.</v>

676
00:29:44.320 --> 00:29:49.320
<v Speaker 2>This is complete stagnation with three </v>
<v Speaker 2>recessions from 1961 to 1969.</v>

677
00:29:49.361 --> 00:29:51.010
<v Speaker 2>So at the beginning of the candidate </v>
<v Speaker 2>administration,</v>

678
00:29:51.011 --> 00:29:52.930
<v Speaker 2>through the end of the Johnson </v>
<v Speaker 2>administration,</v>

679
00:29:53.350 --> 00:29:54.183
<v Speaker 2>economic growth was five point one </v>
<v Speaker 2>percent more than double the rate of </v>

680
00:29:57.131 --> 00:29:57.964
<v Speaker 2>economic growth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now we believe it's a highly </v>

681
00:30:00.611 --> 00:30:04.600
<v Speaker 2>attributable Larry and I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to the policy mix that Kennedy adopted,</v>

682
00:30:04.601 --> 00:30:06.850
<v Speaker 2>which is we are going to guarantee that </v>
<v Speaker 2>dollar.</v>

683
00:30:06.880 --> 00:30:10.240
<v Speaker 2>We're not going to try to get the dollar</v>
<v Speaker 2>off the gold standard and Nixon would.</v>

684
00:30:10.810 --> 00:30:11.643
<v Speaker 2>We're going to guarantee the dollar.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we're not going to have loose money </v>

685
00:30:12.941 --> 00:30:16.720
<v Speaker 2>from the Fed and we're getting get money</v>
<v Speaker 2>out there by lowering tax rates,</v>

686
00:30:16.721 --> 00:30:17.710
<v Speaker 2>particularly on the rich.</v>

687
00:30:18.290 --> 00:30:19.123
<v Speaker 2>It worked.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It worked as beautifully as any public </v>

688
00:30:21.221 --> 00:30:23.800
<v Speaker 2>policy has ever worked in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in American history.</v>

689
00:30:24.210 --> 00:30:25.043
<v Speaker 2>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so let's change gears a little bit here </v>

690
00:30:26.810 --> 00:30:27.643
<v Speaker 2>and talk about some of the civil rights </v>
<v Speaker 2>stuff because as all of this is </v>

691
00:30:29.741 --> 00:30:30.574
<v Speaker 2>happening and there's a ton of.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Obviously we're talking about </v>

692
00:30:31.661 --> 00:30:33.370
<v Speaker 2>economically mostly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

693
00:30:33.371 --> 00:30:36.990
<v Speaker 2>the civil rights movement was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>was happening in,</v>

694
00:30:37.040 --> 00:30:39.850
<v Speaker 2>it's in its best sense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I guess first,</v>

695
00:30:39.851 --> 00:30:40.684
<v Speaker 2>what was his innate feelings about the </v>
<v Speaker 2>civil rights movement and we'll talk </v>

696
00:30:44.861 --> 00:30:46.540
<v Speaker 2>about some of the specific.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

697
00:30:46.980 --> 00:30:50.050
<v Speaker 2>I think John F Kennedy was in favor of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the civil rights movement.</v>

698
00:30:50.650 --> 00:30:53.950
<v Speaker 2>I think he clearly thought that there </v>
<v Speaker 2>should be equal opportunity and a lot of</v>

699
00:30:53.951 --> 00:30:56.290
<v Speaker 2>the recalcitrance that could be found in</v>
<v Speaker 2>the country,</v>

700
00:30:56.370 --> 00:30:57.310
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

701
00:30:57.311 --> 00:31:01.720
<v Speaker 2>was regrettable and should be lifted </v>
<v Speaker 2>when it came to policy though,</v>

702
00:31:01.750 --> 00:31:05.500
<v Speaker 2>he was characteristically slow moving.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So how,</v>

703
00:31:05.501 --> 00:31:07.990
<v Speaker 2>so for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like what could he have done earlier,</v>

704
00:31:08.470 --> 00:31:09.040
<v Speaker 2>etc.</v>

705
00:31:09.040 --> 00:31:09.940
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

706
00:31:09.941 --> 00:31:10.774
<v Speaker 2>I mean now we should note that slow </v>
<v Speaker 2>moving might make sense and that a lot </v>

707
00:31:15.821 --> 00:31:18.970
<v Speaker 2>of civil rights activists argue with </v>
<v Speaker 2>that the laws are already on the books.</v>

708
00:31:19.010 --> 00:31:23.350
<v Speaker 2>I mean there's nothing We need to do </v>
<v Speaker 2>except just be true to ourselves and all</v>

709
00:31:23.351 --> 00:31:27.820
<v Speaker 2>the problems will be lifted you the </v>
<v Speaker 2>freedom rides.</v>

710
00:31:27.970 --> 00:31:28.803
<v Speaker 2>He made phone calls and a birmingham </v>
<v Speaker 2>jail when martin luther king was in the </v>

711
00:31:32.770 --> 00:31:34.840
<v Speaker 2>birmingham crisis in april,</v>
<v Speaker 2>may of 19,</v>

712
00:31:34.841 --> 00:31:35.674
<v Speaker 2>63.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Kennedy wasn't doing a lot aside from </v>

713
00:31:40.061 --> 00:31:40.894
<v Speaker 2>just kind of pressure verbally.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the funny thing about that is that </v>

714
00:31:47.010 --> 00:31:49.990
<v Speaker 2>what a lot of leaders said in a Philip </v>
<v Speaker 2>Randolph had been saying this for a long</v>

715
00:31:49.991 --> 00:31:52.030
<v Speaker 2>time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is that we need jobs.</v>

716
00:31:52.390 --> 00:31:53.800
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>civil rights is nice,</v>

717
00:31:54.190 --> 00:31:55.023
<v Speaker 2>but when black unemployment </v>
<v Speaker 2>unemployment's 20 percent and when you </v>

718
00:31:57.491 --> 00:32:01.150
<v Speaker 2>don't have any shackles to rub together </v>
<v Speaker 2>would go to civil rights.</v>

719
00:32:01.720 --> 00:32:03.400
<v Speaker 2>So kennedy started understand,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

720
00:32:03.460 --> 00:32:06.760
<v Speaker 2>if we have a booming economy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of people in this country,</v>

721
00:32:06.761 --> 00:32:09.580
<v Speaker 2>including whites,</v>
<v Speaker 2>are going to start relaxing and say,</v>

722
00:32:09.640 --> 00:32:10.600
<v Speaker 2>sure,</v>
<v Speaker 2>blacks,</v>

723
00:32:10.601 --> 00:32:11.440
<v Speaker 2>whites,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everything.</v>

724
00:32:11.800 --> 00:32:15.180
<v Speaker 2>Because everyone is well off and that </v>
<v Speaker 2>kennedy perceived.</v>

725
00:32:15.181 --> 00:32:18.670
<v Speaker 2>That's one of the reasons he cut taxes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I know I'm going to get some crap for</v>

726
00:32:18.671 --> 00:32:19.504
<v Speaker 2>saying this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that almost seems like the trump </v>

727
00:32:21.430 --> 00:32:25.960
<v Speaker 2>view of equality that trump has been </v>
<v Speaker 2>cutting taxes.</v>

728
00:32:26.500 --> 00:32:27.760
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

729
00:32:27.880 --> 00:32:29.260
<v Speaker 2>I think I read just a couple of weeks </v>
<v Speaker 2>ago,</v>

730
00:32:29.261 --> 00:32:31.900
<v Speaker 2>the black unemployment is at an all time</v>
<v Speaker 2>low right now,</v>

731
00:32:32.140 --> 00:32:35.210
<v Speaker 2>so he was sort of taking that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a page from the jfk book.</v>

732
00:32:35.860 --> 00:32:36.693
<v Speaker 2>It is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And when I talk about the civil rights </v>

733
00:32:38.320 --> 00:32:43.070
<v Speaker 2>act of four $65 and 64 when kennedy </v>
<v Speaker 2>introduced in june of [inaudible] 63 and</v>

734
00:32:43.071 --> 00:32:44.870
<v Speaker 2>it was passed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

735
00:32:45.350 --> 00:32:46.880
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if the tax cut have been </v>
<v Speaker 2>passed.</v>

736
00:32:46.881 --> 00:32:49.440
<v Speaker 2>If we had had a growing economy and five</v>
<v Speaker 2>percent in the fifth days,</v>

737
00:32:49.441 --> 00:32:51.620
<v Speaker 2>would we have even thought to have a </v>
<v Speaker 2>civil rights act?</v>

738
00:32:51.621 --> 00:32:52.454
<v Speaker 2>I don't know because everyone might have</v>
<v Speaker 2>been getting along well enough that </v>

739
00:32:55.881 --> 00:32:59.270
<v Speaker 2>kennedy kind of came to that realization</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's a real thing.</v>

740
00:32:59.271 --> 00:33:02.270
<v Speaker 2>so if we perceive it today,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we shouldn't run away from it.</v>

741
00:33:02.271 --> 00:33:03.680
<v Speaker 2>That's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a good association.</v>

742
00:33:03.720 --> 00:33:04.553
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's interesting because I know even </v>

743
00:33:06.031 --> 00:33:07.860
<v Speaker 1>just by saying those two names in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>same sentence,</v>

744
00:33:07.861 --> 00:33:09.450
<v Speaker 1>a certain amount of people that are </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to be angry at me,</v>

745
00:33:09.451 --> 00:33:11.220
<v Speaker 1>but that's all right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

746
00:33:11.640 --> 00:33:12.473
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what was the nature of his relationship </v>

747
00:33:13.411 --> 00:33:14.244
<v Speaker 1>with martin luther king?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because I've read a bit about it and it </v>

748
00:33:16.501 --> 00:33:18.360
<v Speaker 1>sounds like it was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was kind of complex.</v>

749
00:33:18.361 --> 00:33:20.580
<v Speaker 1>There were places where they were lined </v>
<v Speaker 1>up,</v>

750
00:33:20.581 --> 00:33:21.490
<v Speaker 1>but not all the time.</v>

751
00:33:21.520 --> 00:33:24.250
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let me answer it this way.</v>

752
00:33:24.280 --> 00:33:27.010
<v Speaker 2>What was the federal government's </v>
<v Speaker 2>relationship with martin luther king?</v>

753
00:33:27.011 --> 00:33:28.360
<v Speaker 2>Because jagger,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hoover of course,</v>

754
00:33:28.361 --> 00:33:29.194
<v Speaker 2>is still doing his thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his fbi director with all the kind of </v>

755
00:33:32.591 --> 00:33:33.424
<v Speaker 2>surveillance,</v>
<v Speaker 2>probably harassment of martin luther </v>

756
00:33:35.201 --> 00:33:39.160
<v Speaker 2>king and kennedy is paralyzed as </v>
<v Speaker 2>everyone is with the fbi.</v>

757
00:33:39.730 --> 00:33:41.260
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so there's that.</v>

758
00:33:41.350 --> 00:33:42.183
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>kennedy is not doing anything about the </v>

759
00:33:44.291 --> 00:33:45.124
<v Speaker 2>kind of harassment</v>

760
00:33:45.170 --> 00:33:48.260
<v Speaker 1>kennedy know about that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do we know if kennedy knew that all that</v>

761
00:33:48.261 --> 00:33:48.980
<v Speaker 1>was happening?</v>

762
00:33:48.980 --> 00:33:49.813
<v Speaker 2>I'd have to look at the files.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We have a lot of those remain </v>

763
00:33:53.541 --> 00:33:55.150
<v Speaker 2>classified.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

764
00:33:55.250 --> 00:33:56.420
<v Speaker 2>so I'm not totally sure.</v>

765
00:33:56.480 --> 00:33:57.313
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They have declassified some of this </v>

766
00:33:57.981 --> 00:33:59.450
<v Speaker 1>stuff just in the last year,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

767
00:33:59.460 --> 00:34:02.630
<v Speaker 1>It's exposed a little bit more of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>surveillance that was happening.</v>

768
00:34:02.640 --> 00:34:03.610
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>mlk.</v>

769
00:34:03.730 --> 00:34:06.490
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But what about their personality</v>

770
00:34:06.520 --> 00:34:07.870
<v Speaker 2>relationship?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

771
00:34:08.680 --> 00:34:12.460
<v Speaker 2>I think kennedy appreciated kings,</v>
<v Speaker 2>intellectual ism.</v>

772
00:34:12.580 --> 00:34:13.413
<v Speaker 2>I mean there was kind of.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He brought a king into the white house </v>

773
00:34:16.511 --> 00:34:17.344
<v Speaker 2>and then he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he watched the march on Washington from </v>

774
00:34:19.751 --> 00:34:20.584
<v Speaker 2>the portico of the white house,</v>
<v Speaker 2>kind of peering around the corner and </v>

775
00:34:22.541 --> 00:34:25.660
<v Speaker 2>then invited everyone back afterwards </v>
<v Speaker 2>and he apparently said,</v>

776
00:34:25.661 --> 00:34:29.290
<v Speaker 2>I wish I could be out there with them </v>
<v Speaker 2>and acted chummy with king,</v>

777
00:34:29.530 --> 00:34:31.540
<v Speaker 2>but he did kind of keep them at arm's </v>
<v Speaker 2>length.</v>

778
00:34:31.541 --> 00:34:35.380
<v Speaker 2>I think he was a little worried about </v>
<v Speaker 2>king's association,</v>

779
00:34:35.460 --> 00:34:39.820
<v Speaker 2>a invidious or not with communism </v>
<v Speaker 2>because kennedy was very anticommunist.</v>

780
00:34:39.890 --> 00:34:40.300
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

781
00:34:40.300 --> 00:34:43.360
<v Speaker 1>So that's interesting because a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>from when we're taping this,</v>

782
00:34:43.361 --> 00:34:47.810
<v Speaker 1>it was just a couple of weeks ago that </v>
<v Speaker 1>it was a martin luther king day and I,</v>

783
00:34:47.811 --> 00:34:48.970
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I find it,</v>

784
00:34:49.030 --> 00:34:51.460
<v Speaker 1>it's one of the strangest days to be on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on twitter.</v>

785
00:34:51.461 --> 00:34:53.470
<v Speaker 1>not that you can garner that much </v>
<v Speaker 1>embraced twitter,</v>

786
00:34:53.640 --> 00:34:54.473
<v Speaker 1>but where everyone's sort of takes mlk </v>
<v Speaker 1>and uses them for their modern day </v>

787
00:34:57.700 --> 00:34:59.290
<v Speaker 1>political purpose.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

788
00:34:59.350 --> 00:35:00.183
<v Speaker 1>So the meme.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So some people saying he was a </v>

789
00:35:00.941 --> 00:35:02.620
<v Speaker 1>socialist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some people saying he was a communist,</v>

790
00:35:02.621 --> 00:35:03.454
<v Speaker 1>he was an environmentalist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>eat whatever you want him to be within </v>

791
00:35:05.591 --> 00:35:07.960
<v Speaker 1>your 2018 lens.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what people use.</v>

792
00:35:07.961 --> 00:35:10.810
<v Speaker 1>But that's really interesting to me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But jfk had this,</v>

793
00:35:11.050 --> 00:35:12.970
<v Speaker 1>this idea of built in him from </v>
<v Speaker 1>childhood,</v>

794
00:35:12.971 --> 00:35:14.950
<v Speaker 1>as you were saying about hating </v>
<v Speaker 1>communism.</v>

795
00:35:15.760 --> 00:35:16.593
<v Speaker 1>Mlk had some association,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at least with sort of loosely communism </v>

796
00:35:19.871 --> 00:35:20.704
<v Speaker 1>or socialism or certainly had issues </v>
<v Speaker 1>with the United States government and </v>

797
00:35:23.530 --> 00:35:25.930
<v Speaker 1>certain levels of capitalism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they did have.</v>

798
00:35:25.990 --> 00:35:27.640
<v Speaker 1>They were at loggerheads in some way.</v>

799
00:35:27.760 --> 00:35:28.593
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think kennedy did not want to get </v>

800
00:35:29.800 --> 00:35:31.150
<v Speaker 2>burned by king.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In other words,</v>

801
00:35:31.151 --> 00:35:33.820
<v Speaker 2>he didn't want to kind of bring king </v>
<v Speaker 2>into his inner circle.</v>

802
00:35:33.821 --> 00:35:37.520
<v Speaker 2>And then king manifests himself as a </v>
<v Speaker 2>flaming communist kennedy.</v>

803
00:35:37.530 --> 00:35:40.470
<v Speaker 2>It was way too cool a character to get </v>
<v Speaker 2>burned that way.</v>

804
00:35:40.740 --> 00:35:43.620
<v Speaker 2>But by the summer of [inaudible] 63.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So after the birmingham crisis,</v>

805
00:35:43.890 --> 00:35:46.290
<v Speaker 2>which was the national outrage on </v>
<v Speaker 2>television,</v>

806
00:35:46.670 --> 00:35:49.200
<v Speaker 2>can I get heckled and his speeches?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>

807
00:35:49.201 --> 00:35:50.580
<v Speaker 2>you're not doing anything about civil </v>
<v Speaker 2>rights.</v>

808
00:35:51.150 --> 00:35:55.620
<v Speaker 2>And that's when he really pushed the tax</v>
<v Speaker 2>cut in that august and september nine,</v>

809
00:35:55.640 --> 00:35:56.473
<v Speaker 2>63.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Which is when the march on Washington </v>

810
00:35:57.301 --> 00:35:58.134
<v Speaker 2>happen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and let's remember the subtitle of the </v>

811
00:35:59.071 --> 00:36:00.450
<v Speaker 2>march on Washington,</v>
<v Speaker 2>martin luther king,</v>

812
00:36:00.451 --> 00:36:01.920
<v Speaker 2>a Philip Randolph was march on </v>
<v Speaker 2>Washington,</v>

813
00:36:01.921 --> 00:36:02.754
<v Speaker 2>was the march on Washington for jobs and</v>
<v Speaker 2>freedom and those are the two sides of </v>

814
00:36:06.661 --> 00:36:08.550
<v Speaker 2>kennedy's legislative agenda,</v>
<v Speaker 2>tax cut.</v>

815
00:36:08.670 --> 00:36:11.160
<v Speaker 2>Civil rights act.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Kennedy actually felt,</v>

816
00:36:11.190 --> 00:36:13.590
<v Speaker 2>we believe that if you had the tax cut </v>
<v Speaker 2>early enough,</v>

817
00:36:13.591 --> 00:36:15.000
<v Speaker 2>you wouldn't even need the civil rights </v>
<v Speaker 2>act.</v>

818
00:36:15.630 --> 00:36:16.463
<v Speaker 2>So that's the way kind of kennedy </v>
<v Speaker 2>walkthrough this going to complicated </v>

819
00:36:19.170 --> 00:36:23.220
<v Speaker 2>politics.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So he really sounds to me sort of like a</v>

820
00:36:23.221 --> 00:36:24.054
<v Speaker 2>politician's politician.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He doesn't sound much like an ideolog </v>

821
00:36:27.250 --> 00:36:28.083
<v Speaker 2>specifically,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that he really was listening to the </v>

822
00:36:30.061 --> 00:36:30.894
<v Speaker 2>people about him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is there anything else that we're </v>

823
00:36:31.411 --> 00:36:34.770
<v Speaker 2>missing to sort of get the full picture </v>
<v Speaker 2>on the way he tried to govern?</v>

824
00:36:34.920 --> 00:36:37.230
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean he got lucky too,</v>

825
00:36:37.231 --> 00:36:39.540
<v Speaker 2>and I hate to use that word in this </v>
<v Speaker 2>context.</v>

826
00:36:39.610 --> 00:36:42.600
<v Speaker 2>I'm the most outrageous event in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>history of the rights movement.</v>

827
00:36:42.601 --> 00:36:46.530
<v Speaker 2>Might be the birmingham birmingham </v>
<v Speaker 2>church bombing and September,</v>

828
00:36:46.530 --> 00:36:48.270
<v Speaker 2>1963 when the four girls were killed by </v>
<v Speaker 2>dynamite,</v>

829
00:36:48.630 --> 00:36:49.463
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that actually made kennedy's tax cut </v>

830
00:36:51.270 --> 00:36:52.103
<v Speaker 2>because the event was so outrageous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Case tax bill was being voted on in </v>

831
00:36:54.931 --> 00:36:55.501
<v Speaker 2>congress.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

832
00:36:55.501 --> 00:37:00.501
<v Speaker 2>Then the southern democrats did not feel</v>
<v Speaker 2>like they could make a show of defeating</v>

833
00:37:00.871 --> 00:37:01.704
<v Speaker 2>kennedy's legislation because that event</v>
<v Speaker 2>was so outrageous and then it slipped </v>

834
00:37:05.221 --> 00:37:07.110
<v Speaker 2>through the house and passed right </v>
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>

835
00:37:07.620 --> 00:37:08.453
<v Speaker 2>So the birmingham church bombing </v>
<v Speaker 2>actually had a lot to do with the </v>

836
00:37:10.861 --> 00:37:13.500
<v Speaker 2>passage of the kennedy tax cut.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's interesting.</v>

837
00:37:13.501 --> 00:37:14.760
<v Speaker 2>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know kennedy,</v>

838
00:37:15.210 --> 00:37:19.170
<v Speaker 2>he was okay as a legislator,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I mean he got away with a lot too.</v>

839
00:37:19.171 --> 00:37:20.280
<v Speaker 2>And he got,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he got a little lucky.</v>

840
00:37:20.670 --> 00:37:22.340
<v Speaker 2>Interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So speaking of luck,</v>

841
00:37:22.410 --> 00:37:23.890
<v Speaker 2>let's talk about the cuban missile </v>
<v Speaker 2>crisis.</v>

842
00:37:23.940 --> 00:37:26.430
<v Speaker 2>Got a little bit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because I guess this really is the.</v>

843
00:37:26.670 --> 00:37:27.503
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess you would argue that the tax </v>

844
00:37:28.471 --> 00:37:29.304
<v Speaker 2>guides really are his biggest legacy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I think most people think of the </v>

845
00:37:32.011 --> 00:37:33.340
<v Speaker 2>cuban missile crisis.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

846
00:37:33.390 --> 00:37:35.180
<v Speaker 2>so just to kind of set the stage.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>

847
00:37:35.580 --> 00:37:37.290
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just want to point out in terms of his</v>

848
00:37:37.291 --> 00:37:40.500
<v Speaker 2>legislative agenda,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think it's disputable,</v>

849
00:37:40.501 --> 00:37:42.330
<v Speaker 2>but the tax cut was his most important </v>
<v Speaker 2>legacy.</v>

850
00:37:42.360 --> 00:37:43.800
<v Speaker 2>Maybe the civil rights act,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but yeah,</v>

851
00:37:43.801 --> 00:37:44.634
<v Speaker 2>when it comes to foreign policy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're talking about two different </v>

852
00:37:47.170 --> 00:37:47.490
<v Speaker 2>ballgames.</v>

853
00:37:47.490 --> 00:37:48.323
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like even as a grad and now that played </v>

854
00:37:49.751 --> 00:37:53.310
<v Speaker 2>right to kennedy's strength,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm afraid because if it was going to be</v>

855
00:37:53.311 --> 00:37:54.144
<v Speaker 2>clarified,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's going to be a contest between </v>

856
00:37:56.321 --> 00:37:59.460
<v Speaker 2>the us and the representative communism,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the soviet union,</v>

857
00:37:59.820 --> 00:38:00.653
<v Speaker 2>the us was going to win so that that </v>
<v Speaker 2>played right into his hands so that we </v>

858
00:38:03.211 --> 00:38:04.960
<v Speaker 2>know that that's built into him from </v>
<v Speaker 2>child.</v>

859
00:38:05.040 --> 00:38:07.650
<v Speaker 2>Just give me a cuban missile.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Crisis was kind of one on one,</v>

860
00:38:07.651 --> 00:38:10.530
<v Speaker 2>a little bit about wHat led up to what </v>
<v Speaker 2>his decision making was.</v>

861
00:38:10.531 --> 00:38:11.364
<v Speaker 2>That showed a piece of wonder.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So nikita khrushchev is the premier of </v>

862
00:38:14.371 --> 00:38:17.280
<v Speaker 2>the soviet union and they use new client</v>
<v Speaker 2>states and Cuba.</v>

863
00:38:17.281 --> 00:38:21.880
<v Speaker 2>If ever since fidel castro had taken </v>
<v Speaker 2>over in 59 and a.</v>

864
00:38:21.900 --> 00:38:24.870
<v Speaker 2>He khrushchev sent nuclear missiles to </v>
<v Speaker 2>Cuba,</v>

865
00:38:25.140 --> 00:38:27.690
<v Speaker 2>so there'd be 90 miles away from us </v>
<v Speaker 2>territory in Florida.</v>

866
00:38:28.470 --> 00:38:32.460
<v Speaker 2>When this is discovered,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a kennedy tells the soviets they have to</v>

867
00:38:32.461 --> 00:38:34.270
<v Speaker 2>get out immediately.</v>
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible]</v>

868
00:38:34.300 --> 00:38:35.133
<v Speaker 2>has done a great tension,</v>
<v Speaker 2>could lead to the firing of missiles in </v>

869
00:38:38.651 --> 00:38:40.900
<v Speaker 2>kennedy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>gets khrushchev to face down.</v>

870
00:38:41.440 --> 00:38:43.780
<v Speaker 2>Kennedy gets him to say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

871
00:38:43.900 --> 00:38:48.190
<v Speaker 2>we'll pull our missiles out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it was Big akan christians face back</v>

872
00:38:48.191 --> 00:38:50.350
<v Speaker 2>in the soviet union.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One tidbit about that,</v>

873
00:38:51.220 --> 00:38:52.053
<v Speaker 2>the documents that came out in november </v>
<v Speaker 2>on the presidential assassination do </v>

874
00:38:55.451 --> 00:38:57.490
<v Speaker 2>seat just this past november,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the last couple of months ago,</v>

875
00:38:57.790 --> 00:38:58.623
<v Speaker 2>do seem to indicate that khrushchev gave</v>
<v Speaker 2>the order after that humiliation to all </v>

876
00:39:03.881 --> 00:39:04.714
<v Speaker 2>networks globally.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The kennedy should be assassinated and </v>

877
00:39:07.211 --> 00:39:10.870
<v Speaker 2>lee harvey oswald may have begun his </v>
<v Speaker 2>preparations because of that director.</v>

878
00:39:11.410 --> 00:39:12.640
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All right,</v>

879
00:39:12.641 --> 00:39:14.470
<v Speaker 2>so I do want to talk about the </v>
<v Speaker 2>assassination.</v>

880
00:39:14.471 --> 00:39:15.304
<v Speaker 2>Obviously even just the way you said </v>
<v Speaker 2>that there's so much of it that it's </v>

881
00:39:18.001 --> 00:39:18.834
<v Speaker 2>hard to piece together.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And how far do you want to go down the </v>

882
00:39:20.351 --> 00:39:22.270
<v Speaker 2>rabbit hole and filed the conspiracies </v>
<v Speaker 2>and all that,</v>

883
00:39:22.271 --> 00:39:23.110
<v Speaker 2>but we will get to that.</v>

884
00:39:23.440 --> 00:39:24.273
<v Speaker 2>But what.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What was the final Moment that got </v>

885
00:39:25.901 --> 00:39:27.160
<v Speaker 2>khrushchev to turn down?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

886
00:39:27.161 --> 00:39:28.870
<v Speaker 2>did kennedy basicaLly say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

887
00:39:28.871 --> 00:39:32.920
<v Speaker 2>I know there's the line of course,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but was it really communicated like this</v>

888
00:39:32.921 --> 00:39:37.921
<v Speaker 2>is going to be world war three?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I thinK to answer that question,</v>

889
00:39:38.560 --> 00:39:41.860
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we have to speak russian and have access</v>

890
00:39:41.861 --> 00:39:46.861
<v Speaker 2>to the archives because I think what </v>
<v Speaker 2>happened is that crew chef felt pressure</v>

891
00:39:47.381 --> 00:39:48.590
<v Speaker 2>at home.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

892
00:39:48.730 --> 00:39:49.563
<v Speaker 2>as a lot of people have said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the soviet union really was the status </v>

893
00:39:51.311 --> 00:39:54.660
<v Speaker 2>quo power in the politburo began asking </v>
<v Speaker 2>khrushchev,</v>

894
00:39:54.970 --> 00:39:55.803
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>are you going to take our lives away </v>

895
00:39:56.651 --> 00:39:58.300
<v Speaker 2>from us?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're going to take our summer docos on</v>

896
00:39:58.301 --> 00:40:03.220
<v Speaker 2>the caspian sea away from us and our,</v>
<v Speaker 2>our 10 percent of us in the soviet union</v>

897
00:40:03.221 --> 00:40:04.780
<v Speaker 2>who have a nice life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

898
00:40:04.870 --> 00:40:07.180
<v Speaker 2>what are you doing?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Would you please Back down?</v>

899
00:40:07.240 --> 00:40:09.730
<v Speaker 2>it seems that whatever kennedy was </v>
<v Speaker 2>doing,</v>

900
00:40:10.060 --> 00:40:12.820
<v Speaker 2>the real folding happened on the soviet </v>
<v Speaker 2>side.</v>

901
00:40:13.210 --> 00:40:16.060
<v Speaker 2>And chris,</v>
<v Speaker 2>jeff was not the first among equals.</v>

902
00:40:16.061 --> 00:40:16.721
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he did not.</v>

903
00:40:16.721 --> 00:40:18.490
<v Speaker 2>He was barely premier of the soviet </v>
<v Speaker 2>union.</v>

904
00:40:18.730 --> 00:40:19.563
<v Speaker 2>So it seems that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and we don't have enough information on </v>

905
00:40:21.371 --> 00:40:22.204
<v Speaker 2>this because it's behind the source </v>
<v Speaker 2>walls that the russians backed down </v>

906
00:40:25.061 --> 00:40:26.880
<v Speaker 2>because they realized khrushchev was </v>
<v Speaker 2>acting crazy.</v>

907
00:40:26.890 --> 00:40:29.170
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This may sound like an amateur question,</v>

908
00:40:29.171 --> 00:40:32.410
<v Speaker 2>but did they ever actually speak the two</v>
<v Speaker 2>of them through translators?</v>

909
00:40:32.411 --> 00:40:36.220
<v Speaker 2>Was there ever or everything goes </v>
<v Speaker 2>through the communication for review.</v>

910
00:40:36.221 --> 00:40:38.650
<v Speaker 2>There's a great book on this called one </v>
<v Speaker 2>hell of A gamble,</v>

911
00:40:38.810 --> 00:40:39.643
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which has all the documents is amazing </v>

912
00:40:41.531 --> 00:40:43.760
<v Speaker 2>book by ernest may and phil zelikow </v>
<v Speaker 2>from,</v>

913
00:40:43.930 --> 00:40:45.790
<v Speaker 2>from the 1990.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So let's look that up.</v>

914
00:40:46.510 --> 00:40:48.460
<v Speaker 2>How much after the cuban missile crisis,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

915
00:40:48.461 --> 00:40:50.620
<v Speaker 2>that really changed everything in </v>
<v Speaker 2>american foreign policy,</v>

916
00:40:50.621 --> 00:40:51.041
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

917
00:40:51.041 --> 00:40:54.040
<v Speaker 2>it really was a huge catalyst for a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

918
00:40:54.130 --> 00:40:56.650
<v Speaker 2>we argue in our book,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

919
00:40:57.010 --> 00:40:57.843
<v Speaker 2>that the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the big change foreign policy wise came </v>

920
00:41:00.101 --> 00:41:00.934
<v Speaker 2>a year later when kennedy countenanced </v>
<v Speaker 2>assisted in the assassination of the </v>

921
00:41:04.361 --> 00:41:07.090
<v Speaker 2>south vietnamese president's am in </v>
<v Speaker 2>november,</v>

922
00:41:07.091 --> 00:41:09.160
<v Speaker 2>just a couple of weeks before kennedy's </v>
<v Speaker 2>assassination.</v>

923
00:41:09.220 --> 00:41:11.170
<v Speaker 2>And that seems to have been the tipping </v>
<v Speaker 2>point in Vietnam.</v>

924
00:41:11.230 --> 00:41:12.063
<v Speaker 2>I'm telling you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've been listening to a lot of the </v>

925
00:41:13.061 --> 00:41:15.790
<v Speaker 2>kennedy tapes on Vietnam with mcnamara </v>
<v Speaker 2>and everything else.</v>

926
00:41:16.580 --> 00:41:17.413
<v Speaker 2>It is true that kennedy had no real </v>
<v Speaker 2>interest in a longterm war in southeast </v>

927
00:41:20.680 --> 00:41:21.910
<v Speaker 2>asia and no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he didn't.</v>

928
00:41:22.480 --> 00:41:23.313
<v Speaker 2>What on earth he was doing helping to </v>
<v Speaker 2>assassinate cme and I have no idea and </v>

929
00:41:26.681 --> 00:41:27.514
<v Speaker 2>that was a big mistake.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So was that really just because he had </v>

930
00:41:31.301 --> 00:41:32.134
<v Speaker 2>this again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he had this thing drilled him from his </v>

931
00:41:33.891 --> 00:41:34.370
<v Speaker 2>father</v>

932
00:41:34.370 --> 00:41:35.203
<v Speaker 1>from childhood about communism and maybe</v>
<v Speaker 1>that overrode the intellectual part of </v>

933
00:41:39.891 --> 00:41:40.724
<v Speaker 1>him that said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's not get into these intractable </v>

934
00:41:41.910 --> 00:41:42.250
<v Speaker 1>wars.</v>

935
00:41:42.250 --> 00:41:43.470
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think.</v>

936
00:41:43.900 --> 00:41:48.040
<v Speaker 2>I think gm and Vietnam was one of those </v>
<v Speaker 2>people that madden kennedy,</v>

937
00:41:48.041 --> 00:41:50.560
<v Speaker 2>because he didn't like king.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He didn't want you to bring him into,</v>

938
00:41:50.620 --> 00:41:53.020
<v Speaker 2>into his circle.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then have you burned him?</v>

939
00:41:54.310 --> 00:41:56.590
<v Speaker 2>Tim was an american guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

940
00:41:56.620 --> 00:41:57.453
<v Speaker 2>He's our guy in south Vietnam and he </v>
<v Speaker 2>just kept alienating people and making </v>

941
00:42:00.731 --> 00:42:03.520
<v Speaker 2>life difficult for the monks scenario </v>
<v Speaker 2>and kennedy's like,</v>

942
00:42:03.550 --> 00:42:05.380
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're supposed to be our guy.</v>

943
00:42:05.381 --> 00:42:06.550
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>John F.</v>

944
00:42:06.550 --> 00:42:07.383
<v Speaker 2>Kennedy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So at some point kennedy will break and </v>

945
00:42:09.401 --> 00:42:09.911
<v Speaker 2>just said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

946
00:42:09.911 --> 00:42:10.990
<v Speaker 2>you're gone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Gone.</v>

947
00:42:10.991 --> 00:42:11.824
<v Speaker 2>And this meant that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fascinated and that is rare in the </v>

948
00:42:16.061 --> 00:42:18.100
<v Speaker 2>kennedy ambit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

949
00:42:18.280 --> 00:42:22.930
<v Speaker 2>and it ended up being not good for </v>
<v Speaker 2>american and vietnamese fortunes for the</v>

950
00:42:22.931 --> 00:42:24.280
<v Speaker 2>next 10 years.</v>

951
00:42:24.390 --> 00:42:25.223
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What else do we need to know about your </v>

952
00:42:26.200 --> 00:42:27.033
<v Speaker 1>sort of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the personal side in terms of what was </v>

953
00:42:28.981 --> 00:42:31.440
<v Speaker 1>going on in the white house during those</v>
<v Speaker 1>years?</v>

954
00:42:32.200 --> 00:42:35.020
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean he ran an elegant white house and</v>

955
00:42:35.021 --> 00:42:37.110
<v Speaker 2>all that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He did have his Kids.</v>

956
00:42:37.120 --> 00:42:37.953
<v Speaker 2>Girlfriends really kind of did that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that side of him to desecrate the white </v>

957
00:42:41.041 --> 00:42:42.780
<v Speaker 2>house and I think we have to understand </v>
<v Speaker 2>what you mean.</v>

958
00:42:42.880 --> 00:42:43.181
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

959
00:42:43.181 --> 00:42:44.014
<v Speaker 1>I think it's hard for people to </v>
<v Speaker 1>understand in a modern sense of what </v>

960
00:42:46.511 --> 00:42:50.170
<v Speaker 1>could it be for social media before </v>
<v Speaker 1>everyone had a phone and all that.</v>

961
00:42:50.350 --> 00:42:51.183
<v Speaker 1>Like what did the average person know </v>
<v Speaker 1>about that at the time or what was the </v>

962
00:42:54.401 --> 00:42:56.460
<v Speaker 1>media even saying about that?</v>

963
00:42:56.720 --> 00:42:59.600
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I kind of the wisdom of crowds.</v>

964
00:42:59.601 --> 00:43:04.601
<v Speaker 2>I think the electorate largely </v>
<v Speaker 2>understood what was going on even though</v>

965
00:43:04.971 --> 00:43:08.270
<v Speaker 2>there's no hard evidence in the papers </v>
<v Speaker 2>and so forth.</v>

966
00:43:08.271 --> 00:43:10.640
<v Speaker 2>And there really wasn't any hard </v>
<v Speaker 2>evidence.</v>

967
00:43:11.000 --> 00:43:11.833
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>now we know about his swimming nude and </v>

968
00:43:13.761 --> 00:43:14.594
<v Speaker 2>this is what the pools and the secret </v>
<v Speaker 2>service having to hold his drinks and </v>

969
00:43:16.401 --> 00:43:20.000
<v Speaker 2>all that stuff and we know all about </v>
<v Speaker 2>that now when judith exner may have been</v>

970
00:43:20.300 --> 00:43:23.510
<v Speaker 2>killed by the communists because she was</v>
<v Speaker 2>a plant and all that.</v>

971
00:43:23.630 --> 00:43:25.130
<v Speaker 2>Judith exner,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but give her punches.</v>

972
00:43:25.300 --> 00:43:26.530
<v Speaker 2>Nice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

973
00:43:27.470 --> 00:43:28.303
<v Speaker 2>I believe that because kennedy had so </v>
<v Speaker 2>many kind of crazy affairs in the white </v>

974
00:43:32.811 --> 00:43:35.630
<v Speaker 2>house,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the press felt that it was burned,</v>

975
00:43:35.750 --> 00:43:36.583
<v Speaker 2>like we're not allowed to report this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's really what gave us water k </v>

976
00:43:38.970 --> 00:43:41.420
<v Speaker 2>because nixon's things were kind of </v>
<v Speaker 2>small in comparison.</v>

977
00:43:41.690 --> 00:43:43.280
<v Speaker 2>And the press just like we got burned </v>
<v Speaker 2>them,</v>

978
00:43:43.281 --> 00:43:44.330
<v Speaker 2>we're not going to get burned again.</v>

979
00:43:44.580 --> 00:43:45.540
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's fascinating.</v>

980
00:43:45.541 --> 00:43:47.010
<v Speaker 1>I've never heard anyone lay it out like </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

981
00:43:47.011 --> 00:43:47.844
<v Speaker 1>So basically they kind of played along </v>
<v Speaker 1>with jfk because they were trying to be </v>

982
00:43:50.671 --> 00:43:51.504
<v Speaker 1>nice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe he was a little bit of their guys </v>

983
00:43:53.300 --> 00:43:54.620
<v Speaker 1>sort of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But then,</v>

984
00:43:54.900 --> 00:43:57.440
<v Speaker 2>and if they felt embarrassed by it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean they felt used.</v>

985
00:43:57.770 --> 00:44:00.320
<v Speaker 2>I mean we're just shutting up about </v>
<v Speaker 2>this.</v>

986
00:44:00.760 --> 00:44:03.820
<v Speaker 2>And then the next time a suggestion of </v>
<v Speaker 2>that came around,</v>

987
00:44:03.860 --> 00:44:05.690
<v Speaker 2>they just went with a sledge hammer.</v>

988
00:44:05.950 --> 00:44:07.480
<v Speaker 1>Interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's really interesting.</v>

989
00:44:07.481 --> 00:44:08.314
<v Speaker 1>Sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So obviously we have to talk about the </v>

990
00:44:09.371 --> 00:44:10.204
<v Speaker 1>assassination.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tell me a little bit just in the weeks </v>

991
00:44:12.731 --> 00:44:15.220
<v Speaker 1>leading up to it and what was going on </v>
<v Speaker 1>in the presidency.</v>

992
00:44:15.440 --> 00:44:16.273
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that was really kennedy's </v>

993
00:44:18.051 --> 00:44:18.884
<v Speaker 2>highest time as president thurston </v>
<v Speaker 2>clarke has written a great book about </v>

994
00:44:20.991 --> 00:44:25.250
<v Speaker 2>kennedy's last hundred days from august </v>
<v Speaker 2>to November,</v>

995
00:44:25.250 --> 00:44:26.900
<v Speaker 2>1963.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But he really was coming into his own.</v>

996
00:44:27.350 --> 00:44:28.183
<v Speaker 2>And I think that's true actually.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He kept talking to the secret service </v>

997
00:44:31.501 --> 00:44:31.861
<v Speaker 2>agent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>

998
00:44:31.861 --> 00:44:33.720
<v Speaker 2>isn't this a great day to Be alive?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

999
00:44:34.050 --> 00:44:36.540
<v Speaker 2>he was really into it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1000
00:44:36.900 --> 00:44:39.140
<v Speaker 2>his tax that was going through.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So [inaudible] was going through,</v>

1001
00:44:39.150 --> 00:44:43.590
<v Speaker 2>the soviets were gone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He just says that's a footnote.</v>

1002
00:44:44.250 --> 00:44:46.230
<v Speaker 2>So how public was that by the way?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Was that.</v>

1003
00:44:46.231 --> 00:44:47.064
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was public.</v>

1004
00:44:47.150 --> 00:44:48.630
<v Speaker 2>It was completely public.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1005
00:44:48.631 --> 00:44:49.464
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was presented as a palace coup that </v>

1006
00:44:51.661 --> 00:44:52.494
<v Speaker 2>it was internal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the american fingerprints were not </v>

1007
00:44:54.331 --> 00:44:55.164
<v Speaker 2>clear at the time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And his ambassador is new ambassador </v>

1008
00:44:57.660 --> 00:44:59.260
<v Speaker 2>henry cabot lodge,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1009
00:44:59.350 --> 00:45:04.290
<v Speaker 2>who defeated in the senate race and </v>
<v Speaker 2>fifties was kind of the fall guy,</v>

1010
00:45:04.291 --> 00:45:05.124
<v Speaker 2>so it appears that he put somebody in </v>
<v Speaker 2>and sat in saigon who would have to </v>

1011
00:45:09.120 --> 00:45:10.380
<v Speaker 2>endure the dirty work.</v>

1012
00:45:10.860 --> 00:45:13.470
<v Speaker 2>So aside from that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>kennedy's enjoying watching polo,</v>

1013
00:45:13.471 --> 00:45:14.304
<v Speaker 2>horace mitchell missile launches and </v>
<v Speaker 2>he's laughing at the senate finance </v>

1014
00:45:17.551 --> 00:45:18.384
<v Speaker 2>committee,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is trying to hold up his tax cut </v>

1015
00:45:19.830 --> 00:45:21.690
<v Speaker 2>and it sounds like you guys keep trying </v>
<v Speaker 2>to hold it up,</v>

1016
00:45:21.720 --> 00:45:22.920
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to win.</v>

1017
00:45:23.070 --> 00:45:25.020
<v Speaker 2>So he's really kind of coming into his </v>
<v Speaker 2>own.</v>

1018
00:45:25.470 --> 00:45:29.750
<v Speaker 2>And then November 22nd.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what was it,</v>

1019
00:45:29.850 --> 00:45:30.683
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how to ask this question properly </v>

1020
00:45:32.251 --> 00:45:34.110
<v Speaker 2>because you see everyone seen so much </v>
<v Speaker 2>about it,</v>

1021
00:45:34.111 --> 00:45:39.000
<v Speaker 2>but the new starts breaking and it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>hard to imagine what breaking news would</v>

1022
00:45:39.001 --> 00:45:40.710
<v Speaker 2>be like at that time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>

1023
00:45:41.130 --> 00:45:44.310
<v Speaker 2>can you kind of frame that a little bit?</v>
<v Speaker 2>We can see these.</v>

1024
00:45:44.311 --> 00:45:46.260
<v Speaker 2>They're on youtube.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1025
00:45:46.530 --> 00:45:49.090
<v Speaker 2>so we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>soap operas back then were,</v>

1026
00:45:49.120 --> 00:45:49.953
<v Speaker 2>were alive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they will be live actors acting out </v>

1027
00:45:53.701 --> 00:45:56.820
<v Speaker 2>the soap opera and they were broken </v>
<v Speaker 2>into.</v>

1028
00:45:56.850 --> 00:45:59.220
<v Speaker 2>and you can watch this again and on the </v>
<v Speaker 2>internet right now,</v>

1029
00:45:59.760 --> 00:46:01.310
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with bulletins from wall,</v>

1030
00:46:01.340 --> 00:46:03.620
<v Speaker 2>from a walter cronkite and so forth,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1031
00:46:03.630 --> 00:46:04.560
<v Speaker 2>saying that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1032
00:46:04.561 --> 00:46:05.394
<v Speaker 2>there's been an incident,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dallas President's been shot and then </v>

1033
00:46:07.081 --> 00:46:07.914
<v Speaker 2>they would go back to the live acting </v>
<v Speaker 2>and then the actors would just start </v>

1034
00:46:10.320 --> 00:46:13.440
<v Speaker 2>acting again about the drama of the soap</v>
<v Speaker 2>opeRa.</v>

1035
00:46:14.430 --> 00:46:18.210
<v Speaker 2>But it took about probably about 45 </v>
<v Speaker 2>minutes to an hour for people to realize</v>

1036
00:46:18.211 --> 00:46:20.990
<v Speaker 2>that that happened here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When the,</v>

1037
00:46:20.991 --> 00:46:24.470
<v Speaker 2>the conspiracies start popping like </v>
<v Speaker 2>immediately where people go,</v>

1038
00:46:24.530 --> 00:46:26.130
<v Speaker 2>something is wrong here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1039
00:46:26.131 --> 00:46:26.964
<v Speaker 2>why was he taking this sort of circular </v>
<v Speaker 2>route and around with the topless card </v>

1040
00:46:32.100 --> 00:46:34.980
<v Speaker 2>and all of that stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like people immediately doing that.</v>

1041
00:46:35.070 --> 00:46:35.671
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

1042
00:46:35.671 --> 00:46:39.810
<v Speaker 2>I mean the trip to dallas itself was </v>
<v Speaker 2>controversial.</v>

1043
00:46:39.811 --> 00:46:40.644
<v Speaker 2>It was in the planning in october,</v>
<v Speaker 2>november because dallas was a hotbed of </v>

1044
00:46:45.061 --> 00:46:47.850
<v Speaker 2>kind of what we might call white </v>
<v Speaker 2>supremacy.</v>

1045
00:46:48.360 --> 00:46:49.980
<v Speaker 2>And people worry.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1046
00:46:50.070 --> 00:46:52.740
<v Speaker 2>and kennedy said it's not country down </v>
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>

1047
00:46:52.800 --> 00:46:53.633
<v Speaker 2>They're kind of anticandida even though </v>
<v Speaker 2>they voted for kennedy because of </v>

1048
00:46:55.741 --> 00:46:56.574
<v Speaker 2>johnson on the ticket.</v>
<v Speaker 2>so everyone was worried about his not </v>

1049
00:46:59.491 --> 00:47:03.000
<v Speaker 2>getting a good reception in Texas from </v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

1050
00:47:03.001 --> 00:47:05.370
<v Speaker 2>kind of called them racist,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1051
00:47:05.371 --> 00:47:07.170
<v Speaker 2>whites,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you want to use those terms.</v>

1052
00:47:08.010 --> 00:47:11.280
<v Speaker 2>But the trip was totally successful on </v>
<v Speaker 2>those counts.</v>

1053
00:47:11.281 --> 00:47:12.114
<v Speaker 2>He went to fort worth and a huge </v>
<v Speaker 2>celebration and he went to dallas and </v>

1054
00:47:15.871 --> 00:47:19.530
<v Speaker 2>everyone loved them in the last words,</v>
<v Speaker 2>perhaps spoken to John F.</v>

1055
00:47:19.530 --> 00:47:20.880
<v Speaker 2>Kennedy were from connally's wife in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>car.</v>

1056
00:47:20.881 --> 00:47:21.714
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's all over now and you can't say the </v>

1057
00:47:23.041 --> 00:47:25.590
<v Speaker 2>Texas doesn't love you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then he was blown away.</v>

1058
00:47:26.070 --> 00:47:27.060
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Incredible.</v>

1059
00:47:27.061 --> 00:47:28.880
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1060
00:47:28.890 --> 00:47:30.100
<v Speaker 2>I think the first time that I</v>

1061
00:47:30.100 --> 00:47:30.933
<v Speaker 1>paid at the end,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the attention to this was probably in </v>

1062
00:47:32.051 --> 00:47:34.120
<v Speaker 1>high school when I saw the movie,</v>
<v Speaker 1>jfk.</v>

1063
00:47:34.210 --> 00:47:35.740
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I assume you've seen the video.</v>

1064
00:47:36.820 --> 00:47:40.300
<v Speaker 1>So how far is as someone that really </v>
<v Speaker 1>cares about this story and all that,</v>

1065
00:47:40.301 --> 00:47:41.134
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how far down all these rabbit holes are </v>

1066
00:47:42.791 --> 00:47:43.624
<v Speaker 1>you willing to go?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It sounds like some of it's still </v>

1067
00:47:45.191 --> 00:47:47.170
<v Speaker 1>unfolding as new documents still come </v>
<v Speaker 1>out,</v>

1068
00:47:47.380 --> 00:47:50.980
<v Speaker 1>but just for you as someone that is </v>
<v Speaker 1>interested in this.</v>

1069
00:47:51.470 --> 00:47:52.670
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I think,</v>

1070
00:47:52.671 --> 00:47:53.504
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there are a couple aspects of the </v>

1071
00:47:54.891 --> 00:47:57.540
<v Speaker 2>assassination that we have to take </v>
<v Speaker 2>seriously,</v>

1072
00:47:57.541 --> 00:48:00.110
<v Speaker 2>that we have to kind of lose our </v>
<v Speaker 2>sophistication about,</v>

1073
00:48:00.111 --> 00:48:01.790
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oswald acted alone.</v>

1074
00:48:01.850 --> 00:48:02.683
<v Speaker 2>Now hold it up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dealey plaza is the best place possible </v>

1075
00:48:05.631 --> 00:48:07.760
<v Speaker 2>for an assassination.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's where it happened.</v>

1076
00:48:08.210 --> 00:48:11.000
<v Speaker 2>That should interest us in terms of </v>
<v Speaker 2>conspiracy theories.</v>

1077
00:48:11.440 --> 00:48:12.470
<v Speaker 2>Can you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>can you explain why?</v>

1078
00:48:12.471 --> 00:48:15.430
<v Speaker 2>I mean there's that slow turn as the </v>
<v Speaker 2>points of vision.</v>

1079
00:48:15.450 --> 00:48:16.283
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's at the end of the parade routes to </v>

1080
00:48:18.111 --> 00:48:18.944
<v Speaker 2>the parade is over and then there has to</v>
<v Speaker 2>be a right turn and a left turn that </v>

1081
00:48:22.101 --> 00:48:25.340
<v Speaker 2>goes then downhill.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the parade's over,</v>

1082
00:48:25.341 --> 00:48:28.940
<v Speaker 2>which means the intensity of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>experiences over in the secret services,</v>

1083
00:48:29.200 --> 00:48:31.970
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>interest will start to wane.</v>

1084
00:48:32.120 --> 00:48:35.120
<v Speaker 2>And that was absolutely essential in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>assassination.</v>

1085
00:48:35.990 --> 00:48:38.270
<v Speaker 2>Then.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there's that setting in those,</v>

1086
00:48:38.271 --> 00:48:39.104
<v Speaker 2>the school book depository right there </v>
<v Speaker 2>with an aggressive goal and an overpass </v>

1087
00:48:42.081 --> 00:48:44.110
<v Speaker 2>to stemmons freeway.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>

1088
00:48:44.330 --> 00:48:46.190
<v Speaker 2>well it's a perfect place for </v>
<v Speaker 2>assassination.</v>

1089
00:48:46.191 --> 00:48:48.770
<v Speaker 2>So therefore we should stop this pseudo </v>
<v Speaker 2>sophistication about,</v>

1090
00:48:48.771 --> 00:48:49.820
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>alice world acted alone.</v>

1091
00:48:50.210 --> 00:48:53.540
<v Speaker 2>The other thing too is kennedy was </v>
<v Speaker 2>absurdly good at making enemies.</v>

1092
00:48:53.900 --> 00:48:54.920
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he just made enemies,</v>

1093
00:48:54.921 --> 00:48:56.990
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his father made enemies for a living.</v>

1094
00:48:57.540 --> 00:48:58.060
<v Speaker 2>So</v>

1095
00:48:58.060 --> 00:49:00.460
<v Speaker 1>by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we've talked for 45 or 50 minutes and we</v>

1096
00:49:00.461 --> 00:49:02.740
<v Speaker 1>haven't even said in military industrial</v>
<v Speaker 1>complex one.</v>

1097
00:49:02.910 --> 00:49:05.170
<v Speaker 1>We obviously had some sort of issues </v>
<v Speaker 1>with him,</v>

1098
00:49:05.171 --> 00:49:06.250
<v Speaker 1>which we can touch on it though,</v>

1099
00:49:06.530 --> 00:49:08.210
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

1100
00:49:08.300 --> 00:49:10.100
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>

1101
00:49:10.101 --> 00:49:14.390
<v Speaker 2>and oswald also had connections to beat </v>
<v Speaker 2>the band with the mob.</v>

1102
00:49:14.410 --> 00:49:15.890
<v Speaker 2>The soviets,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cubans,</v>

1103
00:49:15.891 --> 00:49:16.610
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1104
00:49:16.610 --> 00:49:21.080
<v Speaker 2>so that's also very fruitful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jack ruby oswald was killed.</v>

1105
00:49:21.140 --> 00:49:22.700
<v Speaker 2>Jack ruby has connections to beat the </v>
<v Speaker 2>band.</v>

1106
00:49:22.710 --> 00:49:26.120
<v Speaker 2>So these are all suggestive nonetheless.</v>
<v Speaker 2>James pearson's book,</v>

1107
00:49:26.121 --> 00:49:28.350
<v Speaker 2>camelot and the cultural revolution is </v>
<v Speaker 2>the best book ever written,</v>

1108
00:49:28.351 --> 00:49:29.184
<v Speaker 2>but about the kennedy assassination in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is about the liberal reaction to the </v>

1109
00:49:32.661 --> 00:49:33.494
<v Speaker 2>kennedy assassination because liberals </v>
<v Speaker 2>to this day have pinned it on the white </v>

1110
00:49:37.431 --> 00:49:40.250
<v Speaker 2>supremacists in dallas.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's just crazy.</v>

1111
00:49:40.610 --> 00:49:43.210
<v Speaker 2>He was killed because he was a con </v>
<v Speaker 2>because he was an anticommunist.</v>

1112
00:49:43.220 --> 00:49:44.053
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's pretty clear that lee harvey </v>

1113
00:49:45.291 --> 00:49:47.960
<v Speaker 2>oswald killed John F.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Kennedy because John F.</v>

1114
00:49:47.960 --> 00:49:48.793
<v Speaker 2>Kennedy was anticommunist and we now are</v>
<v Speaker 2>starting to piece together that he may </v>

1115
00:49:52.521 --> 00:49:55.430
<v Speaker 2>have felt he was acting on orders from </v>
<v Speaker 2>the soviet union.</v>

1116
00:49:56.550 --> 00:49:57.383
<v Speaker 1>We may have felt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's an interesting way of phrasing </v>

1117
00:49:59.401 --> 00:50:00.780
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do you mean may have felt</v>

1118
00:50:02.020 --> 00:50:02.853
<v Speaker 2>well?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oswald was quite a character and what </v>

1119
00:50:04.181 --> 00:50:05.650
<v Speaker 2>was going on in his head.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We don't know.</v>

1120
00:50:05.651 --> 00:50:08.500
<v Speaker 2>We do know that he met.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He went to the cube,</v>

1121
00:50:08.530 --> 00:50:09.363
<v Speaker 2>the cuban embassy to me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to soviet assassination expert in </v>

1122
00:50:11.831 --> 00:50:13.030
<v Speaker 2>september 19,</v>
<v Speaker 2>63.</v>

1123
00:50:14.590 --> 00:50:19.590
<v Speaker 2>The documents that just came out imply </v>
<v Speaker 2>that it was understood in late 1962,</v>

1124
00:50:21.070 --> 00:50:21.903
<v Speaker 2>that nikita khrushchev,</v>
<v Speaker 2>after getting burned in the cuban </v>

1125
00:50:23.231 --> 00:50:24.064
<v Speaker 2>missile crisis,</v>
<v Speaker 2>may have sent out some kind of broad </v>

1126
00:50:26.261 --> 00:50:27.094
<v Speaker 2>order into the global soviet network </v>
<v Speaker 2>than it would be desirable if president </v>

1127
00:50:30.201 --> 00:50:31.034
<v Speaker 2>at states were assassinated in that </v>
<v Speaker 2>order may have been called back because </v>

1128
00:50:35.211 --> 00:50:37.400
<v Speaker 2>of pressure within the politburo at </v>
<v Speaker 2>chris chef,</v>

1129
00:50:37.401 --> 00:50:40.160
<v Speaker 2>you're still acting like a nut.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Khrushchev was forced out in 1964,</v>

1130
00:50:41.210 --> 00:50:44.120
<v Speaker 2>but once you squeeze the toothpaste out </v>
<v Speaker 2>of the tube,</v>

1131
00:50:44.121 --> 00:50:47.240
<v Speaker 2>it's done hard to get it back in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it may be,</v>

1132
00:50:47.241 --> 00:50:52.100
<v Speaker 2>this is speculation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but grounded in some sources that oswald</v>

1133
00:50:52.101 --> 00:50:52.934
<v Speaker 2>was part of that initial outreach and </v>
<v Speaker 2>then may not have stopped and then went </v>

1134
00:50:56.721 --> 00:50:57.554
<v Speaker 2>ahead with it.</v>

1135
00:50:58.460 --> 00:51:01.040
<v Speaker 2>So basically you're willing to go down </v>
<v Speaker 2>these,</v>

1136
00:51:01.220 --> 00:51:03.540
<v Speaker 2>these routes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You sort of have to do that.</v>

1137
00:51:03.770 --> 00:51:06.580
<v Speaker 2>The more I read about this and the more </v>
<v Speaker 2>of these documentaries I watched,</v>

1138
00:51:07.230 --> 00:51:09.020
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've got across the and book right there</v>

1139
00:51:09.021 --> 00:51:10.110
<v Speaker 2>and I always quote,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1140
00:51:10.160 --> 00:51:12.530
<v Speaker 2>extraordinary claims require </v>
<v Speaker 2>extraordinary evidence.</v>

1141
00:51:12.531 --> 00:51:14.360
<v Speaker 2>So I don't know that we have the </v>
<v Speaker 2>extraordinary evidence,</v>

1142
00:51:14.660 --> 00:51:17.970
<v Speaker 2>but there were so many pieces in play </v>
<v Speaker 2>here that,</v>

1143
00:51:17.971 --> 00:51:21.380
<v Speaker 2>that make it seem hard to believe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think the one thing that is firming up</v>

1144
00:51:21.381 --> 00:51:22.214
<v Speaker 2>pretty well is that oswald killed </v>
<v Speaker 2>kennedy because he perceived kennedy to </v>

1145
00:51:25.791 --> 00:51:26.624
<v Speaker 2>be anticommunist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it was the left that killed kennedy </v>

1146
00:51:30.980 --> 00:51:34.050
<v Speaker 2>because kennedy was too right wing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1147
00:51:34.250 --> 00:51:36.470
<v Speaker 2>that's been lost over the last 50 some </v>
<v Speaker 2>years.</v>

1148
00:51:36.710 --> 00:51:39.200
<v Speaker 2>That is firming up through a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 2>sources.</v>

1149
00:51:39.440 --> 00:51:40.273
<v Speaker 2>that's the most important thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think to conclude then with the deep </v>

1150
00:51:42.531 --> 00:51:44.930
<v Speaker 2>story of oswald's connections are okay.</v>

1151
00:51:44.930 --> 00:51:46.490
<v Speaker 2>That's interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>From the grassy knoll.</v>

1152
00:51:46.491 --> 00:51:47.750
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's no shot from the grassy knoll.</v>

1153
00:51:47.751 --> 00:51:49.010
<v Speaker 2>It's impossible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Anyone's been a dealer.</v>

1154
00:51:49.011 --> 00:51:51.230
<v Speaker 2>Plaza realizes that's a physical </v>
<v Speaker 2>impossibility.</v>

1155
00:51:51.380 --> 00:51:52.213
<v Speaker 2>All that stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It does appear very clearly that oswald </v>

1156
00:51:54.471 --> 00:51:56.210
<v Speaker 2>fire,</v>
<v Speaker 2>those bullets hit the traffic light.</v>

1157
00:51:56.480 --> 00:51:59.440
<v Speaker 2>Then he hit kennedy in the neck.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then he had kennedy and the dha.</v>

1158
00:51:59.510 --> 00:52:00.343
<v Speaker 2>The magic bullet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's very easy to see with a heavy </v>

1159
00:52:02.451 --> 00:52:04.430
<v Speaker 2>case bullet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Full metal jacket.</v>

1160
00:52:04.431 --> 00:52:05.750
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That will act that way.</v>

1161
00:52:05.870 --> 00:52:08.120
<v Speaker 2>The ballistics aren't a question.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oswald shot kennedy.</v>

1162
00:52:09.110 --> 00:52:13.010
<v Speaker 2>What was it like after the few weeks </v>
<v Speaker 2>after the assassination?</v>

1163
00:52:13.850 --> 00:52:16.370
<v Speaker 2>Johnson was disoriented.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1164
00:52:16.660 --> 00:52:17.493
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his staff of kennedy's people wanted to </v>

1165
00:52:18.681 --> 00:52:20.360
<v Speaker 2>resign.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They didn't like johnson.</v>

1166
00:52:20.900 --> 00:52:24.950
<v Speaker 2>I'm the one thing he realized though,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that,</v>

1167
00:52:25.280 --> 00:52:26.840
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have to act to make,</v>

1168
00:52:26.870 --> 00:52:31.190
<v Speaker 2>to memorialize kennedy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the one specific step he took was he</v>

1169
00:52:31.191 --> 00:52:32.720
<v Speaker 2>told the senate,</v>
<v Speaker 2>guess what you're doing?</v>

1170
00:52:32.960 --> 00:52:33.793
<v Speaker 2>You're passing his tax cut right now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which they did because he could </v>

1171
00:52:36.801 --> 00:52:37.760
<v Speaker 2>intimidate the senate.</v>

1172
00:52:38.150 --> 00:52:38.983
<v Speaker 2>That gave us the tax cut of 1964 and </v>
<v Speaker 2>then kennedy's promise was fulfilled in </v>

1173
00:52:42.141 --> 00:52:44.570
<v Speaker 2>that five percent growth kept cruising </v>
<v Speaker 2>through the sixties.</v>

1174
00:52:45.200 --> 00:52:46.033
<v Speaker 2>What waS the general,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even taking it away from the political </v>

1175
00:52:47.721 --> 00:52:50.180
<v Speaker 2>side,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the general feeling in the country after</v>

1176
00:52:50.181 --> 00:52:51.110
<v Speaker 2>that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1177
00:52:51.140 --> 00:52:53.740
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this whole thing about lost innocence,</v>

1178
00:52:53.820 --> 00:52:54.653
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was just in fort worth a couple of </v>

1179
00:52:55.391 --> 00:52:58.700
<v Speaker 2>weeKs ago and I can't believe fort worth</v>
<v Speaker 2>and dallas have a big rivalry.</v>

1180
00:52:58.701 --> 00:53:02.030
<v Speaker 2>Fort worth thinks as much better than </v>
<v Speaker 2>tantalus reds 30 miles away.</v>

1181
00:53:02.660 --> 00:53:05.270
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everywhere in fort worth there are these</v>

1182
00:53:05.271 --> 00:53:08.190
<v Speaker 2>reminders of kennedy's last,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1183
00:53:08.270 --> 00:53:09.103
<v Speaker 2>moments when America was innocent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're in fort worth and then he went to </v>

1184
00:53:12.291 --> 00:53:14.220
<v Speaker 2>dallas where he was killed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1185
00:53:14.300 --> 00:53:18.170
<v Speaker 2>so that myth of american innocence is </v>
<v Speaker 2>perpetuated.</v>

1186
00:53:18.171 --> 00:53:23.060
<v Speaker 2>I don't think it's particularly a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>makes a lOt of sense in terms of.</v>

1187
00:53:23.990 --> 00:53:24.823
<v Speaker 2>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>kennedy was killed because he was </v>

1188
00:53:26.170 --> 00:53:27.300
<v Speaker 2>anticommunist.</v>

1189
00:53:28.080 --> 00:53:30.360
<v Speaker 2>So I know the narrative makes sense on </v>
<v Speaker 2>that grounds too.</v>

1190
00:53:30.900 --> 00:53:32.250
<v Speaker 2>And I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

1191
00:53:32.320 --> 00:53:33.153
<v Speaker 2>the civil rights movement,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which was a great benefit to the United </v>

1192
00:53:36.540 --> 00:53:37.373
<v Speaker 2>States,</v>
<v Speaker 2>will then push through and flourished </v>

1193
00:53:38.790 --> 00:53:39.623
<v Speaker 2>after 1963.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that kind of lost innocence I've </v>

1194
00:53:41.941 --> 00:53:42.774
<v Speaker 2>never quite understood.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So basically the three markers really </v>

1195
00:53:45.860 --> 00:53:48.870
<v Speaker 2>are the economic stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the tax guides,</v>

1196
00:53:49.160 --> 00:53:52.140
<v Speaker 2>the civil rights stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the cuban missile crisis.</v>

1197
00:53:52.170 --> 00:53:54.900
<v Speaker 2>Is there anything else we're missing in </v>
<v Speaker 2>there that that's important?</v>

1198
00:53:55.100 --> 00:53:56.280
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Vietnam,</v>

1199
00:53:56.330 --> 00:53:59.460
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>kennedy would have never let Vietnam be.</v>

1200
00:53:59.461 --> 00:54:02.340
<v Speaker 2>The disaster was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He would have never let that happen.</v>

1201
00:54:02.341 --> 00:54:06.150
<v Speaker 2>So oliver stone is completely wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That,</v>

1202
00:54:06.310 --> 00:54:07.820
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1203
00:54:07.890 --> 00:54:09.900
<v Speaker 2>that kenny was killed by right wingers </v>
<v Speaker 2>who,</v>

1204
00:54:09.901 --> 00:54:12.510
<v Speaker 2>one of the Vietnam war.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But uh,</v>

1205
00:54:12.540 --> 00:54:13.373
<v Speaker 2>it is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think in escapable to conclude that </v>

1206
00:54:15.481 --> 00:54:18.480
<v Speaker 2>kennedy would not have presided over the</v>
<v Speaker 2>Vietnam wars like johnson did.</v>

1207
00:54:18.660 --> 00:54:19.493
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm curious as a historian and someone </v>

1208
00:54:21.001 --> 00:54:24.300
<v Speaker 2>that deeply cares about this stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you see all of these movies,</v>

1209
00:54:24.301 --> 00:54:27.110
<v Speaker 2>I mean we make everything into movies </v>
<v Speaker 2>now rather jfk and there's lincoln,</v>

1210
00:54:27.510 --> 00:54:30.560
<v Speaker 2>everything now there's like 18 winston </v>
<v Speaker 2>churchill stuff.</v>

1211
00:54:30.960 --> 00:54:33.690
<v Speaker 2>How much does that concern you?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like at some level it's great.</v>

1212
00:54:33.870 --> 00:54:36.570
<v Speaker 2>people are getting basic ideas about </v>
<v Speaker 2>this stuff.</v>

1213
00:54:36.780 --> 00:54:39.780
<v Speaker 2>But then in the case of the jfk movie,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which I really loved by the way,</v>

1214
00:54:39.781 --> 00:54:40.920
<v Speaker 2>and I can,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as you can see,</v>

1215
00:54:40.921 --> 00:54:44.280
<v Speaker 2>I can play those conspiracy games,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that it also is hinting at,</v>

1216
00:54:44.281 --> 00:54:45.910
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a real implication that,</v>

1217
00:54:45.911 --> 00:54:46.744
<v Speaker 2>that johnson maybe had something to do </v>
<v Speaker 2>with it in the jfk movie and read all </v>

1218
00:54:50.071 --> 00:54:50.904
<v Speaker 2>that stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So how much does that worry you that we </v>

1219
00:54:52.111 --> 00:54:52.944
<v Speaker 2>get all of our information now from </v>
<v Speaker 2>movies and documentaries and all that </v>

1220
00:54:57.120 --> 00:55:00.960
<v Speaker 2>history is cult like having a history </v>
<v Speaker 2>originated in the stone age,</v>

1221
00:55:00.961 --> 00:55:03.060
<v Speaker 2>around campfires.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Tell me stories about them.</v>

1222
00:55:03.061 --> 00:55:06.490
<v Speaker 2>And it's not a closeted academic </v>
<v Speaker 2>subject.</v>

1223
00:55:06.500 --> 00:55:08.400
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>academics have a lot to say,</v>

1224
00:55:08.401 --> 00:55:10.200
<v Speaker 2>but there has to be very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1225
00:55:10.400 --> 00:55:12.750
<v Speaker 2>good interaction,</v>
<v Speaker 2>healthy interaction between all of these</v>

1226
00:55:12.751 --> 00:55:14.370
<v Speaker 2>kinds of so called vulgar forms of </v>
<v Speaker 2>history,</v>

1227
00:55:14.371 --> 00:55:16.310
<v Speaker 2>which are wonderful,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1228
00:55:16.380 --> 00:55:18.180
<v Speaker 2>better in certain ways and academic </v>
<v Speaker 2>history.</v>

1229
00:55:18.720 --> 00:55:19.553
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just thought all of a sudden it's </v>

1230
00:55:20.341 --> 00:55:21.210
<v Speaker 2>great movie maker.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1231
00:55:21.211 --> 00:55:23.730
<v Speaker 2>I love his movies and platoon is </v>
<v Speaker 2>incredible movie the others.</v>

1232
00:55:25.020 --> 00:55:27.320
<v Speaker 2>But he has an ax to grind about Vietnam.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1233
00:55:27.370 --> 00:55:30.870
<v Speaker 2>it was the capitalist who gave it to us.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was the right to gave it to us,</v>

1234
00:55:31.410 --> 00:55:32.243
<v Speaker 2>know if you kept the anticommunist </v>
<v Speaker 2>presidents and you've got to realize he </v>

1235
00:55:35.631 --> 00:55:36.464
<v Speaker 2>was anticommunist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He would have realized how to deal with </v>

1236
00:55:38.821 --> 00:55:40.200
<v Speaker 2>that crisis.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hmm.</v>

1237
00:55:40.560 --> 00:55:42.210
<v Speaker 2>Alright.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So to wrap this all up,</v>

1238
00:55:42.211 --> 00:55:44.790
<v Speaker 2>I thought that the right way to end this</v>
<v Speaker 2>would be.</v>

1239
00:55:45.420 --> 00:55:49.230
<v Speaker 2>We've talked a little bit about the sort</v>
<v Speaker 2>of modern day context and the modern day</v>

1240
00:55:49.231 --> 00:55:50.064
<v Speaker 2>lens on some of this stuff and you've </v>
<v Speaker 2>referenced how sort of the parties have </v>

1241
00:55:52.111 --> 00:55:52.944
<v Speaker 2>kind of flipped some of the things that </v>
<v Speaker 2>jfk was saying then would not be things </v>

1242
00:55:56.430 --> 00:55:58.110
<v Speaker 2>that democrats would say.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>

1243
00:55:58.440 --> 00:55:59.273
<v Speaker 2>what do you think his political </v>
<v Speaker 2>alignments would be these days if John </v>

1244
00:56:04.650 --> 00:56:05.550
<v Speaker 2>F.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Kennedy had lived?</v>

1245
00:56:05.940 --> 00:56:08.460
<v Speaker 2>I don't think the democratic party would</v>
<v Speaker 2>have flipped.</v>

1246
00:56:08.490 --> 00:56:10.620
<v Speaker 2>So let's say John F.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Kennedy has two term presidency.</v>

1247
00:56:10.630 --> 00:56:12.300
<v Speaker 2>Somehow we don't really have Vietnam </v>
<v Speaker 2>war.</v>

1248
00:56:12.301 --> 00:56:15.030
<v Speaker 2>He is ex president,</v>
<v Speaker 2>1969.</v>

1249
00:56:15.410 --> 00:56:17.340
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to the democrats spend the next 20,</v>

1250
00:56:17.341 --> 00:56:18.174
<v Speaker 2>30 years saying that kennedy tax cut had</v>
<v Speaker 2>nothing to do with cutting the top </v>

1251
00:56:21.361 --> 00:56:22.080
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

1252
00:56:22.080 --> 00:56:25.630
<v Speaker 2>He would've been forced discipline on </v>
<v Speaker 2>that conversation in the democrats would</v>

1253
00:56:25.631 --> 00:56:28.630
<v Speaker 2>have been born along as the party of tax</v>
<v Speaker 2>cuts.</v>

1254
00:56:28.631 --> 00:56:32.080
<v Speaker 2>So that investment flows into the real </v>
<v Speaker 2>world and there are lots of jobs for the</v>

1255
00:56:32.081 --> 00:56:33.460
<v Speaker 2>regular guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So no,</v>

1256
00:56:33.461 --> 00:56:36.790
<v Speaker 2>I think that the democratic party would </v>
<v Speaker 2>have been a lot different than if he had</v>

1257
00:56:36.791 --> 00:56:37.331
<v Speaker 2>lived.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

1258
00:56:37.331 --> 00:56:40.000
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so he really was the lay's.</v>

1259
00:56:40.060 --> 00:56:42.760
<v Speaker 2>is it fair to say then you think that he</v>
<v Speaker 2>was sort of the last,</v>

1260
00:56:43.060 --> 00:56:47.920
<v Speaker 2>somewhat small democrat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>small government democrat at some level?</v>

1261
00:56:47.950 --> 00:56:48.783
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think what happened is that the left </v>

1262
00:56:49.901 --> 00:56:50.734
<v Speaker 2>took advantage of the assassination </v>
<v Speaker 2>because kennedy wasn't around to defend </v>

1263
00:56:53.411 --> 00:56:56.260
<v Speaker 2>himself specifically because of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>assassination.</v>

1264
00:56:56.260 --> 00:56:57.460
<v Speaker 2>The left said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>aha,</v>

1265
00:56:57.550 --> 00:57:00.310
<v Speaker 2>we can misrepresent his record,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we can hold him high,</v>

1266
00:57:00.330 --> 00:57:04.570
<v Speaker 2>some kind of Big government liberal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then he became that and caroline and</v>

1267
00:57:04.571 --> 00:57:05.404
<v Speaker 2>john john.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're kind of enough to go along with </v>

1268
00:57:07.391 --> 00:57:11.620
<v Speaker 2>that ted certainly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that became the icon of John F.</v>

1269
00:57:11.620 --> 00:57:12.453
<v Speaker 2>Kennedy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>John kennedy himself would have never </v>

1270
00:57:13.181 --> 00:57:15.700
<v Speaker 2>let that happen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I'm trying to place where he would be</v>

1271
00:57:15.701 --> 00:57:16.840
<v Speaker 2>at right now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I'm guessing.</v>

1272
00:57:16.870 --> 00:57:19.360
<v Speaker 2>sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if he was basically for tax cuts,</v>

1273
00:57:19.900 --> 00:57:20.733
<v Speaker 2>he believed in a strong military at some</v>
<v Speaker 2>level because he was fighting communism </v>

1274
00:57:23.830 --> 00:57:27.700
<v Speaker 2>yet also at all these issues with the </v>
<v Speaker 2>military and industrial complex.</v>

1275
00:57:28.070 --> 00:57:28.903
<v Speaker 2>I'm trying to figure out what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how would you frame that type of </v>

1276
00:57:30.911 --> 00:57:34.390
<v Speaker 2>political person these days?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like sort of libertarian,</v>

1277
00:57:34.391 --> 00:57:37.330
<v Speaker 2>but then with a little bit of a neo-con </v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

1278
00:57:37.331 --> 00:57:38.164
<v Speaker 2>Well these days would be very different.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't even thinK we would have had </v>

1279
00:57:40.241 --> 00:57:45.241
<v Speaker 2>bill clinton because kennedy would have </v>
<v Speaker 2>been around to be the elder party leader</v>

1280
00:57:45.700 --> 00:57:46.533
<v Speaker 2>and people wouldn't have been able to </v>
<v Speaker 2>get away with a lot of the </v>

1281
00:57:48.401 --> 00:57:49.234
<v Speaker 2>misrepresentation that they have in </v>
<v Speaker 2>order to make the modern democratic </v>

1282
00:57:52.241 --> 00:57:52.720
<v Speaker 2>party.</v>

1283
00:57:52.720 --> 00:57:53.553
<v Speaker 2>That's interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the assassination and then </v>

1284
00:57:54.851 --> 00:57:55.684
<v Speaker 2>subsequently the whole family sort of </v>
<v Speaker 2>falling apart and Robert Kennedy and </v>

1285
00:57:57.871 --> 00:58:00.700
<v Speaker 2>everything else and I mean that really </v>
<v Speaker 2>did set it,</v>

1286
00:58:00.701 --> 00:58:03.610
<v Speaker 2>set the nation in a strange way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it really did something crazy to the</v>

1287
00:58:03.611 --> 00:58:06.760
<v Speaker 2>democratic party inherently because it's</v>
<v Speaker 2>holding machine.</v>

1288
00:58:06.761 --> 00:58:07.750
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sorT of.</v>

1289
00:58:07.870 --> 00:58:08.920
<v Speaker 2>You mentioned rfk.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1290
00:58:08.950 --> 00:58:13.940
<v Speaker 2>Rfk probably was going to have another </v>
<v Speaker 2>marginal tax cut a.</v>

1291
00:58:13.960 --> 00:58:14.793
<v Speaker 2>Then he's blown away in 1968.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ted kennedy continue to talk about tax </v>

1292
00:58:18.251 --> 00:58:19.084
<v Speaker 2>cuts through the mid seventies and then </v>
<v Speaker 2>only in 1980 became this kind of big </v>

1293
00:58:22.871 --> 00:58:24.880
<v Speaker 2>status,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a government type.</v>

1294
00:58:25.390 --> 00:58:27.460
<v Speaker 2>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we could have.</v>

1295
00:58:27.520 --> 00:58:29.830
<v Speaker 2>It could have been a lot different if </v>
<v Speaker 2>the kennedy boys had lived.</v>

1296
00:58:29.920 --> 00:58:30.753
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you think we're done with the </v>

1297
00:58:31.181 --> 00:58:33.660
<v Speaker 2>dynasties?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it seems to be now that you know,</v>

1298
00:58:33.850 --> 00:58:34.683
<v Speaker 2>hillary lost,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so it seems like perhaps we've had our </v>

1299
00:58:36.281 --> 00:58:37.114
<v Speaker 2>last clinton,</v>
<v Speaker 2>although I'm sure chelsea is going to </v>

1300
00:58:38.711 --> 00:58:40.580
<v Speaker 2>run for senator from New York or </v>
<v Speaker 2>something like that.</v>

1301
00:58:40.950 --> 00:58:41.783
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the bush family really after jeb did so </v>

1302
00:58:43.151 --> 00:58:44.800
<v Speaker 2>horribly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It seems like that might be done.</v>

1303
00:58:44.801 --> 00:58:47.860
<v Speaker 2>Although George Bush down in Texas,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe we'll do something.</v>

1304
00:58:48.550 --> 00:58:52.780
<v Speaker 2>Maybe trump iS goIng to step aside and </v>
<v Speaker 2>let ivanka run next time or who knows,</v>

1305
00:58:52.990 --> 00:58:57.400
<v Speaker 2>but I sense that the dynasty thing </v>
<v Speaker 2>really has people's sort of exhaustion,</v>

1306
00:58:57.420 --> 00:58:58.253
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with families that have this much power </v>

1307
00:59:00.580 --> 00:59:05.580
<v Speaker 2>really has reached a peak and that would</v>
<v Speaker 2>seem to be a celebrity as phenomenon.</v>

1308
00:59:06.370 --> 00:59:08.860
<v Speaker 2>I think again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the assassination is at fault here.</v>

1309
00:59:09.310 --> 00:59:11.500
<v Speaker 2>If John F.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Kennedy had had two full terms,</v>

1310
00:59:11.501 --> 00:59:12.334
<v Speaker 2>would the nation have felt the </v>
<v Speaker 2>obligation to find out about all these </v>

1311
00:59:15.251 --> 00:59:16.870
<v Speaker 2>other kennedy's?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Probably not,</v>

1312
00:59:16.900 --> 00:59:19.690
<v Speaker 2>but the cutting short of that political </v>
<v Speaker 2>career,</v>

1313
00:59:19.930 --> 00:59:21.980
<v Speaker 2>I think is what gave life to all these</v>

1314
00:59:21.980 --> 00:59:24.320
<v Speaker 1>other kennedy's running for office.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

1315
00:59:24.470 --> 00:59:25.970
<v Speaker 1>It's fascinating stuff.</v>
