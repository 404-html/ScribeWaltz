1
00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:06.013
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>mainstream media focuses on trump's </v>

2
00:00:07.131 --> 00:00:11.420
<v Speaker 1>locker room talk and Clinton's emails.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are actually a whole slew of other</v>

3
00:00:11.421 --> 00:00:12.254
<v Speaker 1>interesting political stories happening </v>
<v Speaker 1>right now related to the presidential </v>

4
00:00:15.141 --> 00:00:15.974
<v Speaker 1>election.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This election has seen a massive shift </v>

5
00:00:18.321 --> 00:00:22.610
<v Speaker 1>in America's political alignment on both</v>
<v Speaker 1>the left and the right on the left.</v>

6
00:00:22.611 --> 00:00:23.444
<v Speaker 1>We've seen a real divide between the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Bernie wing of the Democrats and the </v>

7
00:00:26.271 --> 00:00:27.104
<v Speaker 1>Clinton camp.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bernie's message against Wall Street </v>

8
00:00:29.481 --> 00:00:30.314
<v Speaker 1>money in politics,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and his chastising of the political </v>

9
00:00:32.721 --> 00:00:37.190
<v Speaker 1>establishment has been swallowed whole </v>
<v Speaker 1>by the Political Clinton machine.</v>

10
00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:38.533
<v Speaker 1>While Bernie is now supporting Hillary,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's pretty clear that many of his </v>

11
00:00:41.601 --> 00:00:46.310
<v Speaker 1>supporters aren't following his lead in </v>
<v Speaker 1>either donations or enthusiasm.</v>

12
00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:47.623
<v Speaker 1>This division is one of the reasons </v>
<v Speaker 1>hillary is still struggling with young </v>

13
00:00:50.271 --> 00:00:53.330
<v Speaker 1>people and overall connecting with new </v>
<v Speaker 1>voters.</v>

14
00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.980
<v Speaker 1>Meanwhile,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on the right,</v>

15
00:00:54.981 --> 00:00:59.750
<v Speaker 1>we've seen the absolute fracturing of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the Republican Party as we know it.</v>

16
00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:03.950
<v Speaker 1>Mainstream Republicans like Paul Ryan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>John Mccain,</v>

17
00:01:03.951 --> 00:01:06.650
<v Speaker 1>and Jeb Bush are now on the outside </v>
<v Speaker 1>looking in.</v>

18
00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:09.470
<v Speaker 1>As trump has aggressively gutted the </v>
<v Speaker 1>party.</v>

19
00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:12.200
<v Speaker 1>It's pretty clear that if trump wins in </v>
<v Speaker 1>November,</v>

20
00:01:12.201 --> 00:01:16.880
<v Speaker 1>the old guard of the Republicans will be</v>
<v Speaker 1>out and his inside circle of people like</v>

21
00:01:16.881 --> 00:01:18.530
<v Speaker 1>Rudy Giuliani,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Chris Christie,</v>

22
00:01:18.531 --> 00:01:19.364
<v Speaker 1>and Ben Carson will be in while the list</v>
<v Speaker 1>of Republicans not voting for trump </v>

23
00:01:23.061 --> 00:01:26.540
<v Speaker 1>continues to grow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Republican base who voted during the</v>

24
00:01:26.541 --> 00:01:31.160
<v Speaker 1>primaries is still with him and whether </v>
<v Speaker 1>the party is supporting trump or not,</v>

25
00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:35.480
<v Speaker 1>those people are trump's rise also </v>
<v Speaker 1>fractured.</v>

26
00:01:35.481 --> 00:01:39.500
<v Speaker 1>The Republican Party ideologically </v>
<v Speaker 1>neo-cons are either and hiding,</v>

27
00:01:39.501 --> 00:01:40.334
<v Speaker 1>are defecting to Hillary.</v>
<v Speaker 1>While the Christian conservatives are </v>

28
00:01:42.741 --> 00:01:43.574
<v Speaker 1>backing trump,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a candidate who is probably their last </v>

29
00:01:45.621 --> 00:01:48.650
<v Speaker 1>choice when this election began.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's not forget,</v>

30
00:01:48.651 --> 00:01:52.280
<v Speaker 1>this is a guy who compared his own book </v>
<v Speaker 1>to the Bible as they say,</v>

31
00:01:52.281 --> 00:01:56.990
<v Speaker 1>politics makes strange bedfellows for </v>
<v Speaker 1>both the Democrats and the Republicans.</v>

32
00:01:56.991 --> 00:02:01.580
<v Speaker 1>Twenty 16 will be looked back on as a </v>
<v Speaker 1>watershed year regardless of who wins.</v>

33
00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:06.410
<v Speaker 1>It's clear the parties are in flux and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they both desperately need new ideas and</v>

34
00:02:06.411 --> 00:02:07.244
<v Speaker 1>new leaders.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The fact that we have a 69 year old </v>

35
00:02:09.201 --> 00:02:10.034
<v Speaker 1>Democrat running against a 70 year old </v>
<v Speaker 1>Republican tells you all you need to </v>

36
00:02:13.041 --> 00:02:16.280
<v Speaker 1>know about the aging state.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of our two party system,</v>

37
00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:21.730
<v Speaker 1>how is it that these two were the best?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Our system can churn out while it's easy</v>

38
00:02:22.041 --> 00:02:22.874
<v Speaker 1>to mock millennials,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just imagine how you would feel if this </v>

39
00:02:25.161 --> 00:02:25.994
<v Speaker 1>was the first presidential election you </v>
<v Speaker 1>ever really paid attention to or had a </v>

40
00:02:29.241 --> 00:02:30.074
<v Speaker 1>chance to vote it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We've got the ultimate reality star </v>

41
00:02:32.781 --> 00:02:36.740
<v Speaker 1>running against the ultimate insider,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and while they may hate each other,</v>

42
00:02:36.741 --> 00:02:40.850
<v Speaker 1>they are also perfect for each other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>By the time this thing is over,</v>

43
00:02:40.851 --> 00:02:43.430
<v Speaker 1>they'll have thrown out everything but </v>
<v Speaker 1>the kitchen sink,</v>

44
00:02:43.431 --> 00:02:46.910
<v Speaker 1>but that'll only be because they needed </v>
<v Speaker 1>it to wash their dirty hands.</v>

45
00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:48.523
<v Speaker 1>One of the many issues which seems to </v>
<v Speaker 1>have been almost totally shelved during </v>

46
00:02:51.441 --> 00:02:52.274
<v Speaker 1>this campaign is science.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess in some ways science is the </v>

47
00:02:54.621 --> 00:02:55.454
<v Speaker 1>obvious sacrificial lamb in an election </v>
<v Speaker 1>contest focusing so much on mudslinging </v>

48
00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:02.860
<v Speaker 1>instead of discussing the actual issues </v>
<v Speaker 1>that affect our lives.</v>

49
00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:04.023
<v Speaker 1>As we discussed during my chat with </v>
<v Speaker 1>transhumanist is all time van two weeks </v>

50
00:03:07.091 --> 00:03:07.924
<v Speaker 1>ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are so many huge upcoming </v>

51
00:03:09.521 --> 00:03:10.354
<v Speaker 1>scientific breakthroughs coming down the</v>
<v Speaker 1>pike from stem cell research to cloning </v>

52
00:03:13.841 --> 00:03:14.674
<v Speaker 1>to artificial intelligence that we must </v>
<v Speaker 1>talk about these issues now so that </v>

53
00:03:18.341 --> 00:03:19.174
<v Speaker 1>we'll know how to deal with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>ramifications of them both good and bad </v>

54
00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:22.593
<v Speaker 1>when they're right in front of us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Scientific breakthroughs will continue </v>

55
00:03:25.481 --> 00:03:27.760
<v Speaker 1>to happen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether we're prepared for them or not.</v>

56
00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:32.740
<v Speaker 1>Perhaps we can never be fully prepared,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we at least need leaders who believe</v>

57
00:03:32.741 --> 00:03:34.510
<v Speaker 1>in the merits of science in the first </v>
<v Speaker 1>place.</v>

58
00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:37.600
<v Speaker 1>My guest this week is theoretical </v>
<v Speaker 1>physicists,</v>

59
00:03:37.601 --> 00:03:38.434
<v Speaker 1>Lawrence Krauss Kraus,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the foundation professor in the school </v>

60
00:03:41.441 --> 00:03:42.274
<v Speaker 1>of Earth and space exploration and </v>
<v Speaker 1>Physics Department at Arizona State </v>

61
00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:47.643
<v Speaker 1>University,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as well as the director of the origins </v>

62
00:03:49.421 --> 00:03:50.254
<v Speaker 1>project at Asu,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which focuses on the origins of humans </v>

63
00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:54.003
<v Speaker 1>and the universe itself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cross has been outspoken this election </v>

64
00:03:57.370 --> 00:03:58.203
<v Speaker 1>related to politics and science,</v>
<v Speaker 1>particularly the seeming lack of </v>

65
00:04:01.601 --> 00:04:04.210
<v Speaker 1>knowledge in this department by Donald </v>
<v Speaker 1>Trump.</v>

66
00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:09.190
<v Speaker 1>We're going to dive deep both into </v>
<v Speaker 1>science and politics as well as the many</v>

67
00:04:09.191 --> 00:04:10.024
<v Speaker 1>places that the two intersect.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I figure if a guy can spend his adult </v>

68
00:04:12.881 --> 00:04:15.280
<v Speaker 1>life trying to figure out the mysteries </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the universe,</v>

69
00:04:15.490 --> 00:04:16.323
<v Speaker 1>then maybe just maybe he can figure out </v>
<v Speaker 1>the mysteries of our current political </v>

70
00:04:19.901 --> 00:04:24.901
<v Speaker 1>existential crisis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Joining me this week is an author,</v>

71
00:04:28.191 --> 00:04:29.024
<v Speaker 1>a theoretical physicist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and a professor at the school of Earth </v>

72
00:04:31.851 --> 00:04:35.270
<v Speaker 1>and space exploration at Arizona State </v>
<v Speaker 1>University.</v>

73
00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:36.520
<v Speaker 1>Lawrence Krauss.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Welcome to the Rubin [inaudible].</v>

74
00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:40.490
<v Speaker 2>It's great to be here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You are in the middle of like 8,000</v>

75
00:04:40.491 --> 00:04:41.324
<v Speaker 2>things and we're going to have to use </v>
<v Speaker 2>some theoretical physics to fit this in </v>

76
00:04:44.421 --> 00:04:47.780
<v Speaker 2>the time space time continuum.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Eighty thousand plus or minus a million.</v>

77
00:04:47.781 --> 00:04:48.420
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

78
00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:49.640
<v Speaker 2>Plus or minus a million.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All right.</v>

79
00:04:49.641 --> 00:04:53.000
<v Speaker 2>Well I'm very excited to talk to you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think I publicly shamed you into doing</v>

80
00:04:53.001 --> 00:04:54.650
<v Speaker 2>this several times at the reason rally.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

81
00:04:54.651 --> 00:04:56.810
<v Speaker 2>Well it's hard to publicly shame me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you did try.</v>

82
00:04:56.811 --> 00:04:57.231
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

83
00:04:57.231 --> 00:04:57.921
<v Speaker 2>he did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

84
00:04:57.921 --> 00:04:58.580
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and uh,</v>

85
00:04:58.580 --> 00:04:59.413
<v Speaker 2>but I wanted to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just a matter of fitting in and </v>

86
00:05:00.831 --> 00:05:02.360
<v Speaker 2>it's great that we can be here today.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

87
00:05:02.361 --> 00:05:03.194
<v Speaker 2>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I'm very excited you're heading to </v>

88
00:05:04.131 --> 00:05:06.080
<v Speaker 2>ucla to do some more talk to after this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but let's,</v>

89
00:05:06.170 --> 00:05:09.340
<v Speaker 2>let's jump right into the election </v>
<v Speaker 2>because I have to.</v>

90
00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:11.630
<v Speaker 2>Maybe we'll talk about the science.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's about,</v>

91
00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:14.180
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why not as a man of science,</v>

92
00:05:15.170 --> 00:05:18.540
<v Speaker 2>how do you feel about just the tenor of </v>
<v Speaker 2>this and,</v>

93
00:05:18.770 --> 00:05:19.603
<v Speaker 2>and not just the tenor,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but as someone that cares about </v>

94
00:05:21.021 --> 00:05:23.090
<v Speaker 2>empirical evidence,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they don't care about facts.</v>

95
00:05:23.510 --> 00:05:26.630
<v Speaker 2>How do you feel about just the state of </v>
<v Speaker 2>what is going on right now?</v>

96
00:05:26.690 --> 00:05:28.580
<v Speaker 2>It's every,</v>
<v Speaker 2>every year.</v>

97
00:05:28.581 --> 00:05:31.820
<v Speaker 2>I always wonder if it could be worse </v>
<v Speaker 2>because you know,</v>

98
00:05:31.821 --> 00:05:32.654
<v Speaker 2>let's face it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>politics and empirical evidence that </v>

99
00:05:33.980 --> 00:05:34.813
<v Speaker 2>don't go together very well as a rule.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know for a long time I've been </v>

100
00:05:37.161 --> 00:05:37.994
<v Speaker 2>interested in trying to make sure public</v>
<v Speaker 2>policy is based on that and in a lot of </v>

101
00:05:41.511 --> 00:05:43.070
<v Speaker 2>different ways in my writing and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and we,</v>

102
00:05:43.100 --> 00:05:46.400
<v Speaker 2>we actually created a group in 2008 </v>
<v Speaker 2>called science debate,</v>

103
00:05:46.700 --> 00:05:47.533
<v Speaker 2>which we tried to get a presidential </v>
<v Speaker 2>debate on issues of science and </v>

104
00:05:49.941 --> 00:05:52.910
<v Speaker 2>technology.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not to ask them to 10th digit of Pi,</v>

105
00:05:52.911 --> 00:05:53.744
<v Speaker 2>but if the issues that really matter </v>
<v Speaker 2>that are gonna affect the future for </v>

106
00:05:57.711 --> 00:05:59.420
<v Speaker 2>people are not the issues that ever </v>
<v Speaker 2>talked about,</v>

107
00:05:59.421 --> 00:06:00.920
<v Speaker 2>their energy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the environment,</v>

108
00:06:00.921 --> 00:06:02.330
<v Speaker 2>security,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all of that depends on,</v>

109
00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:03.193
<v Speaker 2>on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>on an understanding of science and </v>

110
00:06:04.401 --> 00:06:07.850
<v Speaker 2>technology policy and so it's always </v>
<v Speaker 2>been ignored and we.</v>

111
00:06:07.850 --> 00:06:08.683
<v Speaker 2>And we've been frustrated by it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I have to say that this is this </v>

112
00:06:11.690 --> 00:06:12.523
<v Speaker 2>year,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of course with Donald trump takes the </v>

113
00:06:13.161 --> 00:06:14.620
<v Speaker 2>cake in so many ways.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's the.</v>

114
00:06:15.030 --> 00:06:15.863
<v Speaker 2>I wrote a piece in the New Yorker which </v>
<v Speaker 2>more or less called them the anti </v>

115
00:06:17.751 --> 00:06:19.700
<v Speaker 2>science candidate if such a thing as </v>
<v Speaker 2>possible.</v>

116
00:06:19.880 --> 00:06:20.713
<v Speaker 2>The only person I think on the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Republican slate that was more anti </v>

117
00:06:24.411 --> 00:06:27.350
<v Speaker 2>science remarkably was Ben Carson.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

118
00:06:27.710 --> 00:06:28.980
<v Speaker 2>Let's just talk about Carson.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Really?</v>

119
00:06:29.110 --> 00:06:30.740
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why not?</v>

120
00:06:30.741 --> 00:06:32.690
<v Speaker 2>Because he's such a fool.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How can you be?</v>

121
00:06:32.691 --> 00:06:34.880
<v Speaker 2>He's an.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's a neurosurgeon.</v>

122
00:06:34.881 --> 00:06:36.410
<v Speaker 2>Neurosurgeon,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

123
00:06:36.440 --> 00:06:37.273
<v Speaker 2>How can you be a neurosurgeon and </v>
<v Speaker 2>against so many of the things that a </v>

124
00:06:41.781 --> 00:06:45.240
<v Speaker 2>scientist as well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not just against ignorant about them,</v>

125
00:06:45.250 --> 00:06:46.960
<v Speaker 2>that that's what amazed me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

126
00:06:46.970 --> 00:06:47.803
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

127
00:06:48.080 --> 00:06:50.570
<v Speaker 2>it's one thing to be I logic </v>
<v Speaker 2>ideologically opposed,</v>

128
00:06:50.571 --> 00:06:52.550
<v Speaker 2>but he would talk about evolution away </v>
<v Speaker 2>which clear,</v>

129
00:06:52.630 --> 00:06:54.320
<v Speaker 2>clean them under,</v>
<v Speaker 2>didn't understand evolution,</v>

130
00:06:54.530 --> 00:06:55.363
<v Speaker 2>which is the basis of biology besides </v>
<v Speaker 2>calling the big bang a hoax from the </v>

131
00:06:58.101 --> 00:07:00.280
<v Speaker 2>devil and all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean just fat.</v>

132
00:07:00.350 --> 00:07:00.801
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

133
00:07:00.801 --> 00:07:01.580
<v Speaker 2>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

134
00:07:01.580 --> 00:07:03.380
<v Speaker 2>that in fact we didn't land on the moon,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but uh,</v>

135
00:07:03.550 --> 00:07:04.480
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

136
00:07:04.550 --> 00:07:06.830
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so what it demonstrates is,</v>

137
00:07:06.831 --> 00:07:09.440
<v Speaker 2>and it's unfortunate,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but actually it's relevant.</v>

138
00:07:09.441 --> 00:07:11.370
<v Speaker 2>My mother wanted me to be a doctor and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

139
00:07:11.371 --> 00:07:12.204
<v Speaker 2>and she made the mistake of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of sort of getting me interested in </v>

140
00:07:14.181 --> 00:07:18.440
<v Speaker 2>science and wanted to be a scientist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then I discovered when I was in high</v>

141
00:07:18.441 --> 00:07:21.860
<v Speaker 2>school that doctors weren't scientists.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I apologize to all doctors,</v>

142
00:07:22.880 --> 00:07:23.701
<v Speaker 2>they're not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

143
00:07:23.701 --> 00:07:26.570
<v Speaker 2>and he's a perfect example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you to be,</v>

144
00:07:27.560 --> 00:07:28.393
<v Speaker 2>to be a good that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's not to say how many doctors try </v>

145
00:07:31.101 --> 00:07:31.934
<v Speaker 2>and keep up with science obviously,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but to be a good neurosurgeon requires </v>

146
00:07:34.701 --> 00:07:35.534
<v Speaker 2>eye hand coordination and a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and an understanding of what to what to </v>

147
00:07:38.871 --> 00:07:40.520
<v Speaker 2>do when you open up a brain.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

148
00:07:40.970 --> 00:07:43.190
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I will get in trouble for saying this,</v>

149
00:07:43.191 --> 00:07:44.024
<v Speaker 2>but it's a very sophisticated kind of </v>
<v Speaker 2>car mechanic and so he clearly was very </v>

150
00:07:47.691 --> 00:07:52.460
<v Speaker 2>good at those technical things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but obviously you don't.</v>

151
00:07:52.670 --> 00:07:56.090
<v Speaker 2>Obviously he he not only did not know </v>
<v Speaker 2>much science,</v>

152
00:07:56.091 --> 00:07:56.924
<v Speaker 2>but he he willfully,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and this is the real problem with with </v>

153
00:07:59.720 --> 00:08:00.553
<v Speaker 2>religion it with someone like him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he decides what's right based on the </v>

154
00:08:04.431 --> 00:08:05.264
<v Speaker 2>scriptures and anything disagrees with </v>
<v Speaker 2>it must be wrong and that's that's the </v>

155
00:08:08.301 --> 00:08:11.240
<v Speaker 2>real difference between religion and </v>
<v Speaker 2>science were in religion.</v>

156
00:08:11.241 --> 00:08:12.074
<v Speaker 2>You know the answers before you ask the </v>
<v Speaker 2>questions and in science we try and ask </v>

157
00:08:15.231 --> 00:08:16.064
<v Speaker 2>the questions and find out the answers </v>
<v Speaker 2>and they may surprise us and they may </v>

158
00:08:19.371 --> 00:08:23.060
<v Speaker 2>change over the course of not only may </v>
<v Speaker 2>they often do and the willingness to say</v>

159
00:08:23.061 --> 00:08:27.020
<v Speaker 2>you're wrong or to change your mind is </v>
<v Speaker 2>profoundly important in science.</v>

160
00:08:27.021 --> 00:08:27.854
<v Speaker 2>Which brings us back to Donald Trump,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but real quick just to finish with </v>

161
00:08:31.221 --> 00:08:33.920
<v Speaker 2>Carson because it's such an interesting </v>
<v Speaker 2>example of this.</v>

162
00:08:34.100 --> 00:08:36.330
<v Speaker 2>I'm glad you made the distinction of </v>
<v Speaker 2>saying that he's a neurosurgeon.</v>

163
00:08:36.540 --> 00:08:38.970
<v Speaker 2>Surgeon.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Scientists now fumbled twice.</v>

164
00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:44.000
<v Speaker 2>It's okay because a neuroscientist has </v>
<v Speaker 2>to really have the scientific knowledge,</v>

165
00:08:44.300 --> 00:08:47.480
<v Speaker 2>the way you're describing the souped up </v>
<v Speaker 2>car guy,</v>

166
00:08:47.510 --> 00:08:48.680
<v Speaker 2>car mechanic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

167
00:08:48.681 --> 00:08:49.460
<v Speaker 2>really?</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's doing,</v>

168
00:08:49.460 --> 00:08:52.330
<v Speaker 2>he's doing a physical act.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's,</v>

169
00:08:52.370 --> 00:08:56.000
<v Speaker 2>he's repairing damage and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he needs to know how to do that.</v>

170
00:08:56.001 --> 00:08:57.060
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

171
00:08:57.090 --> 00:08:57.923
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one doesn't want to generalize for all </v>

172
00:08:58.831 --> 00:08:59.664
<v Speaker 2>neurosurgeons based on Ben Carson,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it demonstrates that there's a </v>

173
00:09:03.571 --> 00:09:04.404
<v Speaker 2>difference and he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I'm assuming he was good at what he </v>

174
00:09:06.391 --> 00:09:08.220
<v Speaker 2>did and it wasn't all hype.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

175
00:09:08.221 --> 00:09:09.054
<v Speaker 2>I'm willing to grant him that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but in everything else he says he </v>

176
00:09:12.061 --> 00:09:15.960
<v Speaker 2>expressed more ignorance,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not just antagonism,</v>

177
00:09:15.961 --> 00:09:16.794
<v Speaker 2>but ignorance about fundamental science </v>
<v Speaker 2>than any other candidate in the </v>

178
00:09:20.580 --> 00:09:21.960
<v Speaker 2>Republican Party,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which says a lot because,</v>

179
00:09:22.350 --> 00:09:23.220
<v Speaker 2>because they're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

180
00:09:23.240 --> 00:09:24.073
<v Speaker 2>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it has unfortunately become the anti </v>

181
00:09:26.941 --> 00:09:29.490
<v Speaker 2>science party of late and it wasn't </v>
<v Speaker 2>always that way.</v>

182
00:09:29.500 --> 00:09:34.050
<v Speaker 2>There party has been a big supporter of </v>
<v Speaker 2>science over the years right now because</v>

183
00:09:34.051 --> 00:09:36.570
<v Speaker 2>they insist on denying the existence of </v>
<v Speaker 2>climate change.</v>

184
00:09:36.810 --> 00:09:37.643
<v Speaker 2>And many on the right insist on denying </v>
<v Speaker 2>the existence of evolution or even the </v>

185
00:09:41.341 --> 00:09:43.100
<v Speaker 2>Big Bang,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

186
00:09:43.170 --> 00:09:45.450
<v Speaker 2>and their,</v>
<v Speaker 2>their attitudes towards homosexuality.</v>

187
00:09:45.451 --> 00:09:46.284
<v Speaker 2>They have necessity by ideology,</v>
<v Speaker 2>been forced to confront the evidence of </v>

188
00:09:50.641 --> 00:09:53.970
<v Speaker 2>science and ignore it or,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or disregarded or or,</v>

189
00:09:53.971 --> 00:09:55.080
<v Speaker 2>or lie about it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

190
00:09:55.081 --> 00:09:59.910
<v Speaker 2>So basically they've staked out a </v>
<v Speaker 2>position based on non fact and then that</v>

191
00:09:59.911 --> 00:10:02.650
<v Speaker 2>sort of boxes them in their own real </v>
<v Speaker 2>problem.</v>

192
00:10:02.760 --> 00:10:06.360
<v Speaker 2>What do you do when you're wrong and you</v>
<v Speaker 2>can't afford to say wrong.</v>

193
00:10:06.361 --> 00:10:07.194
<v Speaker 2>And the problem actually the real </v>
<v Speaker 2>problem with politics is people are not </v>

194
00:10:12.481 --> 00:10:13.291
<v Speaker 2>willing to say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know what?</v>

195
00:10:13.291 --> 00:10:17.030
<v Speaker 2>We have this policy but it was wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We've changed our minds because it and,</v>

196
00:10:17.031 --> 00:10:20.850
<v Speaker 2>and I read the public.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One of the reasons I want to have wanted</v>

197
00:10:20.851 --> 00:10:21.684
<v Speaker 2>to insert more science into,</v>
<v Speaker 2>into public policy is not not the </v>

198
00:10:25.590 --> 00:10:26.423
<v Speaker 2>knowledge of science,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the process of science which is </v>

199
00:10:28.920 --> 00:10:31.220
<v Speaker 2>based on empirical evidence and testing </v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

200
00:10:31.221 --> 00:10:32.670
<v Speaker 2>and evolving your views.</v>

201
00:10:32.670 --> 00:10:35.340
<v Speaker 2>And if we really want to have sound </v>
<v Speaker 2>public policy,</v>

202
00:10:35.341 --> 00:10:37.710
<v Speaker 2>we can't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We can't just be willing to say,</v>

203
00:10:37.711 --> 00:10:39.780
<v Speaker 2>oh well someone was wrong once and </v>
<v Speaker 2>therefore,</v>

204
00:10:39.781 --> 00:10:40.614
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're not going to listen to them </v>

205
00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:42.833
<v Speaker 2>stating that you're wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And explaining why is to me raises you </v>

206
00:10:47.521 --> 00:10:48.790
<v Speaker 2>to a higher level.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Someone.</v>

207
00:10:49.200 --> 00:10:50.550
<v Speaker 2>It's a beautiful thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in fact,</v>

208
00:10:50.551 --> 00:10:52.890
<v Speaker 2>as a scientist often say as a </v>
<v Speaker 2>theoretical physicist,</v>

209
00:10:53.100 --> 00:10:57.090
<v Speaker 2>I say the two greatest states to be in </v>
<v Speaker 2>our being wrong or confused because then</v>

210
00:10:57.091 --> 00:10:58.740
<v Speaker 2>that means a lot more to learn.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

211
00:10:58.741 --> 00:11:01.560
<v Speaker 2>There's a little room there for a of.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

212
00:11:01.561 --> 00:11:02.394
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's really learning is a process</v>
<v Speaker 2>of discovering errors and what you were </v>

213
00:11:06.151 --> 00:11:06.840
<v Speaker 2>thinking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

214
00:11:06.840 --> 00:11:09.180
<v Speaker 2>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have often said,</v>

215
00:11:09.181 --> 00:11:10.780
<v Speaker 2>in fact my new book,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I said somewhere that,</v>

216
00:11:10.781 --> 00:11:15.781
<v Speaker 2>that science one of the purposes of </v>
<v Speaker 2>sciences to make people uncomfortable.</v>

217
00:11:16.350 --> 00:11:19.060
<v Speaker 2>And I don't mean that in a bad sense,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if we're always comfortable,</v>

218
00:11:19.140 --> 00:11:20.910
<v Speaker 2>it means we're never going outside our </v>
<v Speaker 2>comfort zone.</v>

219
00:11:20.910 --> 00:11:21.743
<v Speaker 2>It means are myopic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Views are never been questioned or </v>

220
00:11:23.791 --> 00:11:27.030
<v Speaker 2>confronted.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's what living is all about.</v>

221
00:11:27.031 --> 00:11:30.660
<v Speaker 2>That's what mute music,</v>
<v Speaker 2>art literature all about.</v>

222
00:11:30.661 --> 00:11:31.261
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

223
00:11:31.261 --> 00:11:32.490
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll bring in,</v>

224
00:11:32.790 --> 00:11:33.623
<v Speaker 2>happens to be today.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm excited because Bob Dylan just won </v>

225
00:11:35.041 --> 00:11:36.770
<v Speaker 2>the Nobel Prize in literature,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>

226
00:11:36.800 --> 00:11:37.633
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people like Bob don't force us to </v>

227
00:11:38.941 --> 00:11:40.410
<v Speaker 2>confront.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I remember when I was young,</v>

228
00:11:40.740 --> 00:11:44.820
<v Speaker 2>our views about waste society worked and</v>
<v Speaker 2>science should be the same way.</v>

229
00:11:44.821 --> 00:11:48.780
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and good politicians should be,</v>

230
00:11:48.840 --> 00:11:49.673
<v Speaker 2>should be all about that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's amazing to me when I've been in </v>

231
00:11:52.140 --> 00:11:53.440
<v Speaker 2>some other countries and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

232
00:11:53.441 --> 00:11:54.400
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and uh,</v>

233
00:11:54.820 --> 00:11:56.350
<v Speaker 2>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>confronting,</v>

234
00:11:56.760 --> 00:11:57.593
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>presidents or prime ministers who </v>

235
00:11:58.731 --> 00:12:00.130
<v Speaker 2>actually who actually</v>

236
00:12:01.390 --> 00:12:04.290
<v Speaker 2>no something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then that's,</v>

237
00:12:04.550 --> 00:12:05.540
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's not to say,</v>

238
00:12:05.550 --> 00:12:06.790
<v Speaker 2>I mean Obama is a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

239
00:12:06.791 --> 00:12:07.624
<v Speaker 2>Anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to hate mail no matter </v>

240
00:12:09.251 --> 00:12:10.710
<v Speaker 2>what.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're going to get hate mail,</v>

241
00:12:10.750 --> 00:12:11.583
<v Speaker 2>hate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well wait till you see what happens on </v>

242
00:12:12.161 --> 00:12:13.040
<v Speaker 2>twitter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But uh,</v>

243
00:12:13.120 --> 00:12:14.530
<v Speaker 2>but we can talk about Obama and Clinton </v>
<v Speaker 2>too.</v>

244
00:12:14.531 --> 00:12:15.364
<v Speaker 2>But interestingly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it sounds like you're saying you don't </v>

245
00:12:16.870 --> 00:12:17.703
<v Speaker 2>necessarily care if the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if the president knows that much about </v>

246
00:12:21.371 --> 00:12:22.204
<v Speaker 2>sites,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you at least want them to be </v>

247
00:12:22.571 --> 00:12:26.020
<v Speaker 2>intellectually curious enough to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to assign the right people.</v>

248
00:12:26.830 --> 00:12:27.663
<v Speaker 2>It looked.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The president can't be an expert in </v>

249
00:12:28.421 --> 00:12:29.254
<v Speaker 2>everything,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the president needs to know they're </v>

250
00:12:30.971 --> 00:12:32.710
<v Speaker 2>not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The first thing is to know you're not an</v>

251
00:12:32.711 --> 00:12:35.050
<v Speaker 2>expert in everything,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is Donald Trump hasn't yet figured</v>

252
00:12:35.051 --> 00:12:36.910
<v Speaker 2>out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And secondly,</v>

253
00:12:37.150 --> 00:12:40.600
<v Speaker 2>to be intellectually curious and </v>
<v Speaker 2>thirdly,</v>

254
00:12:40.780 --> 00:12:41.613
<v Speaker 2>to choose the right people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's really what you want a president </v>

255
00:12:43.570 --> 00:12:45.200
<v Speaker 2>to do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is have good advisors,</v>

256
00:12:45.201 --> 00:12:49.180
<v Speaker 2>is to know enough to distinguish people </v>
<v Speaker 2>who are full of garbage.</v>

257
00:12:49.180 --> 00:12:50.690
<v Speaker 2>I'll use that word.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

258
00:12:50.800 --> 00:12:51.700
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

259
00:12:51.760 --> 00:12:52.593
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and people you can trust who's opinions </v>

260
00:12:54.491 --> 00:12:57.460
<v Speaker 2>you can trust because you know that </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're willing to be wrong too.</v>

261
00:12:57.790 --> 00:13:00.930
<v Speaker 2>And so I think that's really the </v>
<v Speaker 2>president.</v>

262
00:13:00.980 --> 00:13:02.260
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and uh,</v>

263
00:13:02.360 --> 00:13:03.460
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>

264
00:13:03.630 --> 00:13:04.870
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the current climate,</v>

265
00:13:04.871 --> 00:13:06.460
<v Speaker 2>you obviously can't be an expert in </v>
<v Speaker 2>anything.</v>

266
00:13:06.461 --> 00:13:09.070
<v Speaker 2>And an amazing me when we talk about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

267
00:13:09.071 --> 00:13:10.270
<v Speaker 2>having debate on science,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they say,</v>

268
00:13:10.271 --> 00:13:11.650
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the president shouldn't be a scientist,</v>

269
00:13:11.651 --> 00:13:12.750
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

270
00:13:12.860 --> 00:13:13.693
<v Speaker 2>we have a debate on national security,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but with the president doesn't have to </v>

271
00:13:15.941 --> 00:13:16.774
<v Speaker 2>be a military expert.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He has to be surrounded himself or </v>

272
00:13:19.391 --> 00:13:20.224
<v Speaker 2>herself with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with reasonable people who know what's </v>

273
00:13:21.731 --> 00:13:23.680
<v Speaker 2>going on or,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or on diplomacy.</v>

274
00:13:23.770 --> 00:13:25.990
<v Speaker 2>So is the intellectual curiosity part of</v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

275
00:13:25.991 --> 00:13:28.330
<v Speaker 2>is that the part that about trump gets </v>
<v Speaker 2>you the most?</v>

276
00:13:28.510 --> 00:13:29.343
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's intellectual curiosity and </v>

277
00:13:30.581 --> 00:13:33.370
<v Speaker 2>skepticism.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Skepticism is a key part of science.</v>

278
00:13:34.030 --> 00:13:34.863
<v Speaker 2>Be asking yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is this evidence reasonable and why </v>

279
00:13:37.121 --> 00:13:38.620
<v Speaker 2>should I believe that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

280
00:13:38.710 --> 00:13:39.543
<v Speaker 2>The the thing that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's hard to know what trump is such an </v>

281
00:13:42.611 --> 00:13:44.800
<v Speaker 2>anomaly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the fact that when he says,</v>

282
00:13:44.801 --> 00:13:46.040
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who do you take advice from?</v>

283
00:13:46.060 --> 00:13:47.460
<v Speaker 2>He says for myself,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because I'm,</v>

284
00:13:47.710 --> 00:13:48.543
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know that are mad when when someone </v>

285
00:13:50.291 --> 00:13:52.660
<v Speaker 2>says that no matter what they're running</v>
<v Speaker 2>for,</v>

286
00:13:52.661 --> 00:13:54.190
<v Speaker 2>whether it's president or,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or,</v>

287
00:13:54.191 --> 00:13:54.910
<v Speaker 2>or,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

288
00:13:54.910 --> 00:13:57.370
<v Speaker 2>or,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or head of a school board or whatever,</v>

289
00:13:57.550 --> 00:13:58.383
<v Speaker 2>you should worry about that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so I think it's that and his </v>

290
00:14:03.250 --> 00:14:04.180
<v Speaker 2>incredible</v>

291
00:14:08.190 --> 00:14:11.240
<v Speaker 2>anger and vindictiveness and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people have called him a,</v>

292
00:14:11.550 --> 00:14:12.570
<v Speaker 2>a bully,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>

293
00:14:12.571 --> 00:14:13.404
<v Speaker 2>I did a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I did a dialogue with the Hollywood </v>

294
00:14:15.451 --> 00:14:16.284
<v Speaker 2>friend of mine named Johnny Depp and he </v>
<v Speaker 2>and he pointed out that wasn't who he </v>

295
00:14:18.420 --> 00:14:20.790
<v Speaker 2>actually,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he actually played Donald Trump in it.</v>

296
00:14:20.820 --> 00:14:23.250
<v Speaker 2>You should watch it on Netflix.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it was a great show where he,</v>

297
00:14:23.370 --> 00:14:24.780
<v Speaker 2>he looks just like him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's great.</v>

298
00:14:25.050 --> 00:14:26.680
<v Speaker 2>But he said that Donald Trump isn't a </v>
<v Speaker 2>bully.</v>

299
00:14:26.681 --> 00:14:28.470
<v Speaker 2>He's a brat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that,</v>

300
00:14:28.560 --> 00:14:29.393
<v Speaker 2>that defines the man to me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's not a bully so much as just a </v>

301
00:14:31.831 --> 00:14:33.630
<v Speaker 2>spoiled Brat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Who,</v>

302
00:14:33.700 --> 00:14:35.100
<v Speaker 2>who,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if he's losing,</v>

303
00:14:35.101 --> 00:14:39.120
<v Speaker 2>finds a reason to blame other people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It does.</v>

304
00:14:39.150 --> 00:14:39.983
<v Speaker 2>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's the center of his own universe and </v>

305
00:14:41.881 --> 00:14:43.410
<v Speaker 2>all of that is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is,</v>

306
00:14:43.420 --> 00:14:44.610
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is,</v>

307
00:14:44.820 --> 00:14:48.450
<v Speaker 2>is terrifying and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and ignorant in the extreme.</v>

308
00:14:48.451 --> 00:14:49.284
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the,</v>

309
00:14:49.560 --> 00:14:52.820
<v Speaker 2>when I wrote about science and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the candidates this year,</v>

310
00:14:53.870 --> 00:14:54.703
<v Speaker 2>one of the statements that trump made </v>
<v Speaker 2>that just to me epitomizes the level of </v>

311
00:14:58.491 --> 00:15:00.710
<v Speaker 2>ignorance of the man because first of </v>
<v Speaker 2>all,</v>

312
00:15:00.711 --> 00:15:03.980
<v Speaker 2>a lot of what he says is just meant he </v>
<v Speaker 2>doesn't care whether it's true or not.</v>

313
00:15:03.980 --> 00:15:07.790
<v Speaker 2>He thinks it'll play well or not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That I can understand when you say,</v>

314
00:15:08.060 --> 00:15:10.100
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why are we worried about the ozone?</v>

315
00:15:10.101 --> 00:15:10.934
<v Speaker 2>Why can't I have know aerosols in my </v>
<v Speaker 2>hairspray because I only use my </v>

316
00:15:13.461 --> 00:15:15.520
<v Speaker 2>hairspray indoors.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it can affect,</v>

317
00:15:15.970 --> 00:15:20.970
<v Speaker 2>can affect you that Mr said that now </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the kind of thing you say.</v>

318
00:15:21.591 --> 00:15:23.660
<v Speaker 2>Oh my goodness gracious.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So anyway,</v>

319
00:15:23.810 --> 00:15:25.160
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that one's tough.</v>

320
00:15:25.161 --> 00:15:26.090
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

321
00:15:26.091 --> 00:15:27.890
<v Speaker 2>so we've got your feelings on trump,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think.</v>

322
00:15:27.920 --> 00:15:29.060
<v Speaker 2>I think they're clear,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

323
00:15:29.390 --> 00:15:30.140
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well I have,</v>

324
00:15:30.140 --> 00:15:32.740
<v Speaker 2>I've been trying to moderate them less,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

325
00:15:32.790 --> 00:15:33.621
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

326
00:15:33.621 --> 00:15:34.454
<v Speaker 2>the p,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just wrote a piece in the New Yorker </v>

327
00:15:35.420 --> 00:15:35.970
<v Speaker 2>Today on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>on,</v>

328
00:15:35.970 --> 00:15:37.100
<v Speaker 2>on the nuclear threat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

329
00:15:37.520 --> 00:15:38.353
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

330
00:15:38.990 --> 00:15:42.590
<v Speaker 2>to be more serious,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his misunderstanding of,</v>

331
00:15:42.640 --> 00:15:46.280
<v Speaker 2>of the fact that nuclear weapons are not</v>
<v Speaker 2>meant to be used.</v>

332
00:15:46.740 --> 00:15:47.340
<v Speaker 2>And in fact,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

333
00:15:47.340 --> 00:15:49.640
<v Speaker 2>as I pointed out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it demonstrates a lot of our,</v>

334
00:15:49.940 --> 00:15:53.990
<v Speaker 2>of the illogical nature of our nuclear </v>
<v Speaker 2>policy.</v>

335
00:15:54.200 --> 00:15:55.011
<v Speaker 2>But when he says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're,</v>

336
00:15:55.011 --> 00:15:55.761
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if we build them,</v>

337
00:15:55.761 --> 00:15:58.870
<v Speaker 2>why can't we use them that anyone has </v>
<v Speaker 2>thought about it,</v>

338
00:15:58.871 --> 00:16:02.100
<v Speaker 2>I realized that you can't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can't use them in any strategic way.</v>

339
00:16:02.380 --> 00:16:03.213
<v Speaker 2>And so it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and if he wants to encourage other </v>

340
00:16:04.851 --> 00:16:05.720
<v Speaker 2>countries to build them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>

341
00:16:05.740 --> 00:16:06.573
<v Speaker 2>he misunderstands the whole point of </v>
<v Speaker 2>proliferation and those things are </v>

342
00:16:09.291 --> 00:16:10.580
<v Speaker 2>serious.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're not,</v>

343
00:16:10.610 --> 00:16:12.080
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we can't laugh over that stuff.</v>

344
00:16:12.460 --> 00:16:15.140
<v Speaker 2>So I really tried and I think mostly </v>
<v Speaker 2>people that watch your show,</v>

345
00:16:15.320 --> 00:16:18.020
<v Speaker 2>I really tried to be fair to him and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

346
00:16:18.190 --> 00:16:19.690
<v Speaker 2>and whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So when,</v>

347
00:16:19.700 --> 00:16:21.260
<v Speaker 2>when he's talking about the nuclear </v>
<v Speaker 2>stuff,</v>

348
00:16:21.290 --> 00:16:23.240
<v Speaker 2>and I'll say something like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

349
00:16:23.360 --> 00:16:24.193
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Japan should have nukes so that they </v>

350
00:16:25.191 --> 00:16:26.930
<v Speaker 2>could defend themselves potentially from</v>
<v Speaker 2>China.</v>

351
00:16:27.140 --> 00:16:30.410
<v Speaker 2>It seems to me that there's some grain </v>
<v Speaker 2>of truth in the,</v>

352
00:16:30.860 --> 00:16:32.720
<v Speaker 2>in the concept of that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

353
00:16:32.721 --> 00:16:36.050
<v Speaker 2>that we shouldn't have to feel like we </v>
<v Speaker 2>have to defend Japan.</v>

354
00:16:36.300 --> 00:16:38.090
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're saying it really throws off every</v>

355
00:16:38.091 --> 00:16:40.880
<v Speaker 2>sort of preceptive how all these nations</v>
<v Speaker 2>have.</v>

356
00:16:40.940 --> 00:16:42.670
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it prints rolls off the precept of,</v>

357
00:16:42.720 --> 00:16:45.140
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of really what we should be trying to do</v>

358
00:16:45.141 --> 00:16:45.974
<v Speaker 2>with nuclear weapons,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which we isn't talked about enough </v>

359
00:16:48.170 --> 00:16:50.720
<v Speaker 2>today,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is we want to reduce the number of</v>

360
00:16:50.721 --> 00:16:53.180
<v Speaker 2>nuclear weapons,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the world because there's really no good</v>

361
00:16:53.181 --> 00:16:57.170
<v Speaker 2>use for the right eye.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And we built up this incredible stash of</v>

362
00:16:57.171 --> 00:16:58.004
<v Speaker 2>nuclear weapons because of the Cold War </v>
<v Speaker 2>and we had this policy of mutually </v>

363
00:17:00.231 --> 00:17:01.064
<v Speaker 2>assured destruction.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we had to have enough to ensure that </v>

364
00:17:02.841 --> 00:17:06.170
<v Speaker 2>total annihilation of the Soviet Union </v>
<v Speaker 2>when the Soviet Union.</v>

365
00:17:06.500 --> 00:17:09.590
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's okay.</v>

366
00:17:09.591 --> 00:17:11.930
<v Speaker 2>But we then have in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even at the time of Nixon,</v>

367
00:17:11.931 --> 00:17:12.764
<v Speaker 2>we signed the Nonproliferation Treaty.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Most people think the Nonproliferation </v>

368
00:17:16.400 --> 00:17:18.650
<v Speaker 2>Treaty,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and this is so typical of the US,</v>

369
00:17:19.120 --> 00:17:22.100
<v Speaker 2>is designed to say no one should have </v>
<v Speaker 2>nuclear weapons but us.</v>

370
00:17:22.430 --> 00:17:23.810
<v Speaker 2>And that's not what it's about.</v>

371
00:17:24.230 --> 00:17:27.470
<v Speaker 2>It's trying to say we don't want to have</v>
<v Speaker 2>nuclear weapons to spread,</v>

372
00:17:28.310 --> 00:17:29.143
<v Speaker 2>but the other thing that the nuclear </v>
<v Speaker 2>nations agreed to in the </v>

373
00:17:32.731 --> 00:17:37.460
<v Speaker 2>Nonproliferation Treaty was to disarm </v>
<v Speaker 2>and so we have an obligation.</v>

374
00:17:37.461 --> 00:17:38.294
<v Speaker 2>We are violating the Nonproliferation </v>
<v Speaker 2>Treaty today in this country as much as </v>

375
00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:44.833
<v Speaker 2>North Korea may be by trying to get </v>
<v Speaker 2>nuclear weapons are getting new weapons </v>

376
00:17:47.081 --> 00:17:47.914
<v Speaker 2>or Iran,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which happily they've been stopped from </v>

377
00:17:49.020 --> 00:17:52.980
<v Speaker 2>getting them for the moment because we </v>
<v Speaker 2>are not making an open effort.</v>

378
00:17:52.981 --> 00:17:56.700
<v Speaker 2>Did it's arm and Obama who whose heart </v>
<v Speaker 2>was certainly the right place.</v>

379
00:17:56.701 --> 00:17:57.481
<v Speaker 2>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

380
00:17:57.481 --> 00:18:00.030
<v Speaker 2>we see the world should,</v>
<v Speaker 2>should get rid of nuclear weapons,</v>

381
00:18:00.240 --> 00:18:01.500
<v Speaker 2>and initially the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

382
00:18:01.520 --> 00:18:03.300
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his administration actually did an,</v>

383
00:18:03.410 --> 00:18:07.590
<v Speaker 2>an agreement with the Soviet Union with </v>
<v Speaker 2>the Russia to reduce the number of arms,</v>

384
00:18:07.800 --> 00:18:12.300
<v Speaker 2>but we still have way too many.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We still have a thousand nuclear weapons</v>

385
00:18:12.301 --> 00:18:13.134
<v Speaker 2>on hair trigger alert,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which means they can be launched </v>

386
00:18:15.210 --> 00:18:18.690
<v Speaker 2>instantaneously if,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if there's a warning of an attack,</v>

387
00:18:18.691 --> 00:18:19.950
<v Speaker 2>whether the warning is real or not.</v>

388
00:18:20.070 --> 00:18:20.903
<v Speaker 2>The president only has a few minutes to </v>
<v Speaker 2>decide that is not necessary in the </v>

389
00:18:23.881 --> 00:18:25.860
<v Speaker 2>modern world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And also,</v>

390
00:18:25.861 --> 00:18:27.510
<v Speaker 2>unfortunately,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I'm happy to see that,</v>

391
00:18:27.750 --> 00:18:29.250
<v Speaker 2>that Hillary Clinton seems to be against</v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

392
00:18:29.490 --> 00:18:33.900
<v Speaker 2>We are barking at a $1,000,000,000,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>modernization of nuclear weapons fleet,</v>

393
00:18:34.080 --> 00:18:34.913
<v Speaker 2>which is only reasonable if we plan to </v>
<v Speaker 2>keep our nuclear weapons level at what </v>

394
00:18:39.601 --> 00:18:40.710
<v Speaker 2>it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If we say no,</v>

395
00:18:40.711 --> 00:18:42.240
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>eventually want to reduce them.</v>

396
00:18:42.480 --> 00:18:43.313
<v Speaker 2>We don't have to spend that much money </v>
<v Speaker 2>trying to maintain the arsenal we now </v>

397
00:18:45.751 --> 00:18:46.584
<v Speaker 2>have.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so it's interesting to me to see </v>

398
00:18:49.951 --> 00:18:52.890
<v Speaker 2>that the nuclear issue,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which over time has been,</v>

399
00:18:52.950 --> 00:18:53.783
<v Speaker 2>has raised and lowered in importance.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The public doesn't seem to think about </v>

400
00:18:55.801 --> 00:19:00.210
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it is still the major threat,</v>

401
00:19:00.480 --> 00:19:03.020
<v Speaker 2>the major existential threat to </v>
<v Speaker 2>civilization.</v>

402
00:19:03.021 --> 00:19:06.150
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and we as a country are not doing enough</v>

403
00:19:06.210 --> 00:19:07.043
<v Speaker 2>and it is true at the same time that </v>
<v Speaker 2>we're probably going to this more than </v>

404
00:19:10.591 --> 00:19:11.310
<v Speaker 2>you want to know.</v>

405
00:19:11.310 --> 00:19:12.143
<v Speaker 2>But it's true that Russia is getting </v>
<v Speaker 2>more worrisome than they were afforded </v>

406
00:19:15.100 --> 00:19:19.950
<v Speaker 2>the saber rattling the arguments about </v>
<v Speaker 2>nuclear weapons are much worse now under</v>

407
00:19:19.951 --> 00:19:21.960
<v Speaker 2>Putin in the last few years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they were.</v>

408
00:19:22.140 --> 00:19:24.030
<v Speaker 2>So there's some concerns in that regard.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>

409
00:19:24.480 --> 00:19:25.313
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

410
00:19:26.040 --> 00:19:29.750
<v Speaker 2>we could take unilateral steps which </v>
<v Speaker 2>would lead us in the right direction,</v>

411
00:19:29.760 --> 00:19:30.593
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So even if Russia was 10 times worse </v>

412
00:19:32.821 --> 00:19:36.360
<v Speaker 2>than you might,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if we had half of our stockpile it,</v>

413
00:19:36.361 --> 00:19:38.060
<v Speaker 2>we'd still be more than enough to </v>
<v Speaker 2>destroy.</v>

414
00:19:38.070 --> 00:19:40.920
<v Speaker 2>If we had a 10th of our,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if we had a 10th of our stock pile,</v>

415
00:19:40.921 --> 00:19:41.320
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>

416
00:19:41.320 --> 00:19:43.830
<v Speaker 2>we could still not only annihilate the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Soviet Union,</v>

417
00:19:43.831 --> 00:19:46.380
<v Speaker 2>but essentially create enough mess to </v>
<v Speaker 2>destroy the world.</v>

418
00:19:46.860 --> 00:19:47.693
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

419
00:19:47.870 --> 00:19:48.531
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

420
00:19:48.531 --> 00:19:50.710
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>

421
00:19:51.190 --> 00:19:54.240
<v Speaker 2>we need to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we need to realize that fact and,</v>

422
00:19:54.241 --> 00:19:56.070
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and realize that we can,</v>

423
00:19:56.160 --> 00:19:56.993
<v Speaker 2>as I say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>unilateral actions are often responded </v>

424
00:19:59.130 --> 00:20:00.390
<v Speaker 2>to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>For example,</v>

425
00:20:00.660 --> 00:20:02.840
<v Speaker 2>another area where we spend money that </v>
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>

426
00:20:02.860 --> 00:20:05.760
<v Speaker 2>that's a waste of time for the most part</v>
<v Speaker 2>is missile defense.</v>

427
00:20:06.260 --> 00:20:10.250
<v Speaker 2>When one of the things I love is a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>George Bush claimed that they were gonna</v>

428
00:20:10.260 --> 00:20:12.360
<v Speaker 2>have a missile defense system ready in </v>
<v Speaker 2>2004.</v>

429
00:20:12.361 --> 00:20:13.770
<v Speaker 2>He was during the election.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

430
00:20:13.850 --> 00:20:14.683
<v Speaker 2>and of course it turned out that most 50</v>
<v Speaker 2>percent of the American public thought </v>

431
00:20:18.121 --> 00:20:20.580
<v Speaker 2>we already had one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And as they was going at the time,</v>

432
00:20:20.940 --> 00:20:21.773
<v Speaker 2>what they should say is we already have </v>
<v Speaker 2>one just as effective as this system </v>

433
00:20:25.231 --> 00:20:27.890
<v Speaker 2>that doesn't work,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it doesn't cost $100 million.</v>

434
00:20:27.990 --> 00:20:31.770
<v Speaker 2>So it's a lot less expensive and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it serves the same effect.</v>

435
00:20:31.800 --> 00:20:36.300
<v Speaker 2>So how much of this though is just that </v>
<v Speaker 2>a huge percentage of our economy is tied</v>

436
00:20:36.301 --> 00:20:37.710
<v Speaker 2>into the military?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is,</v>

437
00:20:37.711 --> 00:20:40.500
<v Speaker 2>but you know the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But what you're hearing in the president</v>

438
00:20:40.501 --> 00:20:42.690
<v Speaker 2>of the election is we're not spending </v>
<v Speaker 2>enough.</v>

439
00:20:43.080 --> 00:20:46.920
<v Speaker 2>And that's what scary.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What we need to do is spend rationally.</v>

440
00:20:46.930 --> 00:20:48.880
<v Speaker 2>People said that for a long time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

441
00:20:48.881 --> 00:20:49.714
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we spend almost a trillion dollars on </v>

442
00:20:51.131 --> 00:20:51.450
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>on,</v>

443
00:20:51.450 --> 00:20:52.780
<v Speaker 2>on defense every year.</v>

444
00:20:53.050 --> 00:20:55.180
<v Speaker 2>And the question is we have to look and </v>
<v Speaker 2>say,</v>

445
00:20:55.181 --> 00:20:56.590
<v Speaker 2>what are we need?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look,</v>

446
00:20:56.950 --> 00:20:57.783
<v Speaker 2>it's not as if we can disarm as a nation</v>
<v Speaker 2>completely in all ways the world is a </v>

447
00:21:01.091 --> 00:21:03.310
<v Speaker 2>dangerous place.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the question is,</v>

448
00:21:03.311 --> 00:21:05.440
<v Speaker 2>do we need to spend that kind of money?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the answer,</v>

449
00:21:05.441 --> 00:21:08.890
<v Speaker 2>I think for many people as we could </v>
<v Speaker 2>spend less more effectively.</v>

450
00:21:09.190 --> 00:21:13.900
<v Speaker 2>Do you think there's any situation where</v>
<v Speaker 2>ethically we could use nukes?</v>

451
00:21:13.901 --> 00:21:14.201
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if,</v>

452
00:21:14.201 --> 00:21:15.034
<v Speaker 2>let's say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because I don't think it's going to be </v>

453
00:21:16.001 --> 00:21:18.090
<v Speaker 2>through a nation state,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but let's say they,</v>

454
00:21:18.100 --> 00:21:18.933
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>somebody got a dirty bomb in here and </v>

455
00:21:20.021 --> 00:21:21.760
<v Speaker 2>blew up times square.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the question is,</v>

456
00:21:21.761 --> 00:21:22.594
<v Speaker 2>what do you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think the answer generally is no </v>

457
00:21:26.680 --> 00:21:27.513
<v Speaker 2>nuclear weapons right now are useful for</v>
<v Speaker 2>deterrence to stop other people from </v>

458
00:21:30.071 --> 00:21:31.480
<v Speaker 2>doing things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it is,</v>

459
00:21:31.510 --> 00:21:32.343
<v Speaker 2>you hit an interesting point that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that when might you use them and see </v>

460
00:21:35.110 --> 00:21:38.980
<v Speaker 2>what many people may not realize is that</v>
<v Speaker 2>the country has no.</v>

461
00:21:39.430 --> 00:21:42.430
<v Speaker 2>Most people think the US has a no first </v>
<v Speaker 2>use policy,</v>

462
00:21:42.700 --> 00:21:44.560
<v Speaker 2>namely we would never be the first ones </v>
<v Speaker 2>using them.</v>

463
00:21:44.950 --> 00:21:47.110
<v Speaker 2>We don't write that because we said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

464
00:21:47.111 --> 00:21:49.420
<v Speaker 2>what if not someone who uses nuclear </v>
<v Speaker 2>weapons,</v>

465
00:21:49.421 --> 00:21:51.640
<v Speaker 2>but what if someone launches biological </v>
<v Speaker 2>weapons?</v>

466
00:21:52.050 --> 00:21:53.440
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>shouldn't we be allowed to nuke them?</v>

467
00:21:53.441 --> 00:21:54.274
<v Speaker 2>Or what if someone nukes South Korea </v>
<v Speaker 2>shouldn't be allowed to nuke and </v>

468
00:21:56.940 --> 00:21:57.773
<v Speaker 2>response?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so these are questions that you can </v>

469
00:21:59.531 --> 00:22:01.440
<v Speaker 2>debate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But uh,</v>

470
00:22:01.780 --> 00:22:03.250
<v Speaker 2>on the whole,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the question is what,</v>

471
00:22:03.310 --> 00:22:06.730
<v Speaker 2>what do you gain versus conventional </v>
<v Speaker 2>forces?</v>

472
00:22:07.150 --> 00:22:09.700
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>other than active anger,</v>

473
00:22:10.320 --> 00:22:11.153
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>If the act has already been done yet </v>

474
00:22:12.240 --> 00:22:14.870
<v Speaker 2>here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so the question is what do you,</v>

475
00:22:15.010 --> 00:22:18.220
<v Speaker 2>the idea should be to stop that in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>future?</v>

476
00:22:18.770 --> 00:22:19.603
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not an and inevitably the problem is </v>

477
00:22:21.671 --> 00:22:25.960
<v Speaker 2>that under many scenarios,</v>
<v Speaker 2>once you start using nuclear weapons,</v>

478
00:22:26.310 --> 00:22:27.630
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it proliferates and,</v>

479
00:22:27.940 --> 00:22:32.410
<v Speaker 2>and what's been pointed out by a bunch </v>
<v Speaker 2>of his sister even bout 10 years ago,</v>

480
00:22:33.280 --> 00:22:36.150
<v Speaker 2>you may remember nuclear winter with </v>
<v Speaker 2>Carl Sagan and that there was,</v>

481
00:22:36.160 --> 00:22:37.480
<v Speaker 2>that was sort of discredited a little </v>
<v Speaker 2>bit,</v>

482
00:22:37.481 --> 00:22:38.314
<v Speaker 2>but in fact even at a limited nuclear </v>
<v Speaker 2>war between India and Pakistan have 50 </v>

483
00:22:42.611 --> 00:22:44.980
<v Speaker 2>or a hundred weapons,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which may sound like a lot,</v>

484
00:22:44.981 --> 00:22:48.460
<v Speaker 2>but it's the kind of thing you might </v>
<v Speaker 2>expect in a nuclear war would,</v>

485
00:22:48.760 --> 00:22:49.593
<v Speaker 2>would raise enough basically dust in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>atmosphere to for a decade affect </v>

486
00:22:54.040 --> 00:22:54.910
<v Speaker 2>agriculture.</v>

487
00:22:55.180 --> 00:22:58.330
<v Speaker 2>Ultimately perhaps killing a billion </v>
<v Speaker 2>people through starvation.</v>

488
00:22:58.690 --> 00:23:00.850
<v Speaker 2>So there's no such thing as a limited </v>
<v Speaker 2>nuclear war.</v>

489
00:23:00.940 --> 00:23:02.080
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it,</v>

490
00:23:02.260 --> 00:23:03.093
<v Speaker 2>and everyone,</v>
<v Speaker 2>including the right wing guys like </v>

491
00:23:04.841 --> 00:23:08.470
<v Speaker 2>George Schultz and Henry Kissinger came </v>
<v Speaker 2>up a bunch of years ago and said,</v>

492
00:23:08.471 --> 00:23:12.550
<v Speaker 2>we need to basically work towards a </v>
<v Speaker 2>nuclear free world because as long as we</v>

493
00:23:12.551 --> 00:23:16.120
<v Speaker 2>have nuclear weapons,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're all at risk.</v>

494
00:23:16.180 --> 00:23:19.870
<v Speaker 2>So how do you untie that then from the </v>
<v Speaker 2>legitimate parts of deterrent?</v>

495
00:23:20.420 --> 00:23:24.370
<v Speaker 2>If your argument is that deterrence is </v>
<v Speaker 2>an important piece of the strategy,</v>

496
00:23:24.371 --> 00:23:25.204
<v Speaker 2>because might be by having deterrence,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't necessarily have to fight a </v>

497
00:23:27.191 --> 00:23:28.900
<v Speaker 2>ground war.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How do you untie those?</v>

498
00:23:28.930 --> 00:23:29.691
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>

499
00:23:29.691 --> 00:23:31.090
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how many you can ask right now?</v>

500
00:23:31.091 --> 00:23:32.940
<v Speaker 2>How many nuclear weapons you need to </v>
<v Speaker 2>deter a,</v>

501
00:23:32.950 --> 00:23:33.783
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>an aggressor and you certainly don't </v>

502
00:23:36.071 --> 00:23:36.410
<v Speaker 2>need.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We,</v>

503
00:23:36.410 --> 00:23:38.770
<v Speaker 2>the United States has $5,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>over the Russia.</v>

504
00:23:38.800 --> 00:23:39.611
<v Speaker 2>Russia,</v>
<v Speaker 2>excuse me,</v>

505
00:23:39.611 --> 00:23:40.620
<v Speaker 2>I grew up in the Soviet Union.</v>

506
00:23:40.720 --> 00:23:41.870
<v Speaker 2>You forgetting what year it is?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

507
00:23:41.871 --> 00:23:44.920
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know Russia has Russia,</v>

508
00:23:45.470 --> 00:23:47.200
<v Speaker 2>another $5,000.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>

509
00:23:47.220 --> 00:23:48.860
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we don't need 5,000</v>

510
00:23:48.861 --> 00:23:49.694
<v Speaker 2>weapons to deter him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>100 nuclear weapons would be more than </v>

511
00:23:53.211 --> 00:23:56.620
<v Speaker 2>enough to destroy basically any country </v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

512
00:23:56.621 --> 00:23:59.790
<v Speaker 2>and dramatically affect the world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So maybe we could immediately go down to</v>

513
00:23:59.791 --> 00:24:00.624
<v Speaker 2>a hundred weapons will be indifference </v>
<v Speaker 2>then ultimately for someone that's </v>

514
00:24:02.871 --> 00:24:05.060
<v Speaker 2>hearing you and saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well if we haven't but we're not using,</v>

515
00:24:05.061 --> 00:24:06.600
<v Speaker 2>what's the difference whether we have </v>
<v Speaker 2>$5,000</v>

516
00:24:07.070 --> 00:24:10.580
<v Speaker 2>to maintain a fleet of a 5,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>weapons,</v>

517
00:24:10.581 --> 00:24:13.730
<v Speaker 2>including the infrastructure requires an</v>
<v Speaker 2>incredible amount of money.</v>

518
00:24:13.760 --> 00:24:15.860
<v Speaker 2>Got It.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that alone,</v>

519
00:24:15.861 --> 00:24:17.270
<v Speaker 2>in fact,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this $1,000,000,000,000</v>

520
00:24:17.271 --> 00:24:20.120
<v Speaker 2>modernization gives you an example of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the infrastructure costs.</v>

521
00:24:20.330 --> 00:24:22.880
<v Speaker 2>So there are economic costs as well as </v>
<v Speaker 2>security costs.</v>

522
00:24:22.881 --> 00:24:25.040
<v Speaker 2>And if we decided rationally,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know what?</v>

523
00:24:25.041 --> 00:24:25.874
<v Speaker 2>It's better to know it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like if you have 10 cars that cost </v>

524
00:24:28.311 --> 00:24:30.380
<v Speaker 2>you a lot more money to maintain them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then if you have one,</v>

525
00:24:30.381 --> 00:24:31.880
<v Speaker 2>it's not just the cost of the cars.</v>

526
00:24:31.950 --> 00:24:34.940
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So as a theoretical physicist,</v>

527
00:24:34.941 --> 00:24:35.774
<v Speaker 2>when you talk about all of this stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have an insight into how things </v>

528
00:24:39.531 --> 00:24:41.660
<v Speaker 2>actually work that the average person </v>
<v Speaker 2>doesn't have.</v>

529
00:24:42.020 --> 00:24:46.820
<v Speaker 2>Do you worry that you'll ever stumble </v>
<v Speaker 2>upon something or you know,</v>

530
00:24:46.821 --> 00:24:47.654
<v Speaker 2>somehow accidentally or maybe </v>
<v Speaker 2>intentionally you find something and </v>

531
00:24:50.301 --> 00:24:52.970
<v Speaker 2>then realize how it can be turned into </v>
<v Speaker 2>something horrific.</v>

532
00:24:52.971 --> 00:24:55.760
<v Speaker 2>I mean that's like the big apocalyptic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I he not happily what I,</v>

533
00:24:55.780 --> 00:24:56.613
<v Speaker 2>I'm always pleased to say that what I </v>
<v Speaker 2>work on has no practical significance </v>

534
00:24:59.691 --> 00:25:01.670
<v Speaker 2>whatsoever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I heard you say that,</v>

535
00:25:02.570 --> 00:25:05.690
<v Speaker 2>but its origins and history of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>universe and,</v>

536
00:25:05.691 --> 00:25:06.630
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and uh,</v>

537
00:25:06.770 --> 00:25:07.610
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can never.</v>

538
00:25:07.611 --> 00:25:08.444
<v Speaker 2>Of course,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the great thing about science is you </v>

539
00:25:09.471 --> 00:25:10.304
<v Speaker 2>never know what's going to be discovered</v>
<v Speaker 2>or what the implications so that I </v>

540
00:25:12.861 --> 00:25:14.720
<v Speaker 2>guess.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But if you had to pick one area that had</v>

541
00:25:14.721 --> 00:25:17.640
<v Speaker 2>less direct practical significance,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

542
00:25:17.950 --> 00:25:20.690
<v Speaker 2>it'd be hard to find one that more than </v>
<v Speaker 2>mine,</v>

543
00:25:20.691 --> 00:25:21.524
<v Speaker 2>which was where I try and understand how</v>
<v Speaker 2>the universe began and how it's going </v>

544
00:25:23.650 --> 00:25:23.960
<v Speaker 2>end.</v>

545
00:25:23.960 --> 00:25:26.210
<v Speaker 2>And these,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these questions are incredibly important</v>

546
00:25:26.211 --> 00:25:30.530
<v Speaker 2>for us culturally,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the but the kind of new physics that</v>

547
00:25:30.531 --> 00:25:31.364
<v Speaker 2>we try and develop and understand </v>
<v Speaker 2>affects the universe on scales that </v>

548
00:25:34.940 --> 00:25:37.340
<v Speaker 2>really are divorced from human scales </v>
<v Speaker 2>directly.</v>

549
00:25:37.610 --> 00:25:40.580
<v Speaker 2>Obviously they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they relate to what the reasons.</v>

550
00:25:40.960 --> 00:25:42.560
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how we got here.</v>

551
00:25:42.561 --> 00:25:43.394
<v Speaker 2>My new book,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which I will plug called the greatest </v>

552
00:25:45.111 --> 00:25:47.870
<v Speaker 2>story ever told so far,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the subtitles on March 27th,</v>

553
00:25:47.990 --> 00:25:49.640
<v Speaker 2>March 2017.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's.</v>

554
00:25:49.790 --> 00:25:51.740
<v Speaker 2>But at the subtitle is called why are we</v>
<v Speaker 2>here?</v>

555
00:25:52.160 --> 00:25:55.700
<v Speaker 2>And ultimately we want to understand </v>
<v Speaker 2>those questions and unfortunately,</v>

556
00:25:55.701 --> 00:25:59.500
<v Speaker 2>religion tries to usurp those questions </v>
<v Speaker 2>that I want to point out how science can</v>

557
00:25:59.501 --> 00:26:00.334
<v Speaker 2>dress them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So their fundamental sort of cultural </v>

558
00:26:01.791 --> 00:26:02.624
<v Speaker 2>questions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>

559
00:26:03.020 --> 00:26:05.660
<v Speaker 2>but I like to say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>although it's pretentious,</v>

560
00:26:05.690 --> 00:26:08.360
<v Speaker 2>because I don't want to meet comparison,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but my work is,</v>

561
00:26:08.630 --> 00:26:12.230
<v Speaker 2>the work by people like me is as useful </v>
<v Speaker 2>as a Mozart symphony.</v>

562
00:26:12.230 --> 00:26:14.930
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's at its best at its best.</v>

563
00:26:14.931 --> 00:26:16.630
<v Speaker 2>It can be as useful as a Mozart </v>
<v Speaker 2>symphony.</v>

564
00:26:16.760 --> 00:26:19.670
<v Speaker 2>It enhances the cultural experience of </v>
<v Speaker 2>being human.</v>

565
00:26:19.910 --> 00:26:21.320
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I'm happily,</v>

566
00:26:22.270 --> 00:26:24.590
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not as worried about that,</v>

567
00:26:24.591 --> 00:26:29.320
<v Speaker 2>but on the other hand,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what we need to do is for.</v>

568
00:26:29.390 --> 00:26:31.190
<v Speaker 2>There's an old expression,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think from Pesto,</v>

569
00:26:31.191 --> 00:26:32.690
<v Speaker 2>but it could be from later on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I never,</v>

570
00:26:32.720 --> 00:26:33.553
<v Speaker 2>I've tried to track it down at fortune </v>
<v Speaker 2>favors the prepared mind and what we </v>

571
00:26:37.041 --> 00:26:40.250
<v Speaker 2>need to do or think about what the </v>
<v Speaker 2>possibilities are.</v>

572
00:26:40.460 --> 00:26:41.293
<v Speaker 2>So we're prepared to act and we can't be</v>
<v Speaker 2>prepared to act if we put our heads in </v>

573
00:26:45.031 --> 00:26:48.540
<v Speaker 2>the sand so we can say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

574
00:26:48.541 --> 00:26:49.950
<v Speaker 2>we should never,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

575
00:26:49.951 --> 00:26:50.940
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

576
00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:53.190
<v Speaker 2>do genetic engineering.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it's happening.</v>

577
00:26:53.460 --> 00:26:54.293
<v Speaker 2>We w we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so we can talk about artificial </v>

578
00:26:56.671 --> 00:26:59.430
<v Speaker 2>intelligence and say we need to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we need to stop that,</v>

579
00:26:59.431 --> 00:27:00.264
<v Speaker 2>but it's not going to be stopped what we</v>
<v Speaker 2>need to do or think about the </v>

580
00:27:02.551 --> 00:27:03.090
<v Speaker 2>possibilities.</v>

581
00:27:03.090 --> 00:27:03.923
<v Speaker 2>And that's one of the reasons why the </v>
<v Speaker 2>origins project that run at Asu is so </v>

582
00:27:06.271 --> 00:27:07.104
<v Speaker 2>for me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so exciting because we try to bring </v>

583
00:27:08.461 --> 00:27:10.500
<v Speaker 2>scientists together to look at forefront</v>
<v Speaker 2>questions,</v>

584
00:27:10.740 --> 00:27:15.000
<v Speaker 2>but then we have public events were 3000</v>
<v Speaker 2>people attend and listen.</v>

585
00:27:15.001 --> 00:27:18.390
<v Speaker 2>And the point is to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

586
00:27:18.391 --> 00:27:21.090
<v Speaker 2>you can't have a good democracy without </v>
<v Speaker 2>an informed population.</v>

587
00:27:21.091 --> 00:27:21.924
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so to try and raise these questions </v>

588
00:27:23.881 --> 00:27:25.950
<v Speaker 2>and get people to think about the </v>
<v Speaker 2>possibilities are,</v>

589
00:27:26.220 --> 00:27:29.180
<v Speaker 2>will allow us to be better prepared for </v>
<v Speaker 2>an,</v>

590
00:27:29.390 --> 00:27:30.223
<v Speaker 2>for surprising possibilities in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>future because we don't know where the </v>

591
00:27:33.091 --> 00:27:33.960
<v Speaker 2>future lies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

592
00:27:33.970 --> 00:27:34.803
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

593
00:27:34.870 --> 00:27:35.703
<v Speaker 2>I often say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I said it on a film recently that </v>

594
00:27:38.400 --> 00:27:39.233
<v Speaker 2>I'm not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If someone tells you they're a futurist </v>

595
00:27:40.891 --> 00:27:42.660
<v Speaker 2>in my mind,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's when he stopped listening because</v>

596
00:27:43.350 --> 00:27:44.183
<v Speaker 2>I try not to make predictions about </v>
<v Speaker 2>anything other than like 2 trillion </v>

597
00:27:46.231 --> 00:27:47.730
<v Speaker 2>years in the future because that's a.</v>

598
00:27:47.820 --> 00:27:49.650
<v Speaker 2>What do you call that as a super future?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

599
00:27:49.651 --> 00:27:50.820
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because first of all,</v>

600
00:27:50.821 --> 00:27:52.800
<v Speaker 2>no one will be around a test and it is </v>
<v Speaker 2>much easier but,</v>

601
00:27:53.100 --> 00:27:53.933
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we don't discoveries are called </v>

602
00:27:56.611 --> 00:27:57.444
<v Speaker 2>discoveries because there are surprises,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we can try and at least anticipate </v>

603
00:28:00.121 --> 00:28:00.954
<v Speaker 2>the set of possibilities so it will be a</v>
<v Speaker 2>little less surprised and all of us can </v>

604
00:28:03.691 --> 00:28:04.524
<v Speaker 2>do that and that's why you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you say I'm a scientist and I have </v>

605
00:28:06.331 --> 00:28:07.021
<v Speaker 2>access.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's true.</v>

606
00:28:07.021 --> 00:28:10.290
<v Speaker 2>I have access to some information people</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't normally have access to,</v>

607
00:28:10.530 --> 00:28:11.363
<v Speaker 2>but the process of science we can all be</v>
<v Speaker 2>at least have a perspective of what's </v>

608
00:28:14.011 --> 00:28:14.844
<v Speaker 2>happening and that's why it's important.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's why I spend time in the public </v>

609
00:28:19.711 --> 00:28:20.544
<v Speaker 2>hat trying to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>trying to explain and explore science </v>

610
00:28:23.581 --> 00:28:24.414
<v Speaker 2>for the public,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not just because it's interesting and </v>

611
00:28:25.351 --> 00:28:26.184
<v Speaker 2>exciting and it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's fun and people are fascinated by </v>

612
00:28:28.411 --> 00:28:29.244
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but because hopefully it will be useful </v>

613
00:28:31.111 --> 00:28:33.810
<v Speaker 2>when people try and confront the </v>
<v Speaker 2>challenges of the 21st century.</v>

614
00:28:33.840 --> 00:28:34.673
<v Speaker 2>Alright.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I want to spend the rest of this </v>

615
00:28:35.311 --> 00:28:38.400
<v Speaker 2>talking about your actual work and </v>
<v Speaker 2>origins and stuff like that.</v>

616
00:28:38.401 --> 00:28:42.110
<v Speaker 2>But my last question on this part,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have no agenda but I know you don't.</v>

617
00:28:42.120 --> 00:28:43.710
<v Speaker 2>You've made it very clear which I love </v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

618
00:28:43.711 --> 00:28:44.544
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well my last part goes to your public </v>

619
00:28:45.691 --> 00:28:48.210
<v Speaker 2>happy because clearly you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're willing to talk about politics,</v>

620
00:28:48.360 --> 00:28:49.710
<v Speaker 2>you're willing to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

621
00:28:49.890 --> 00:28:52.860
<v Speaker 2>speak about things freely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And as you emailed me,</v>

622
00:28:52.861 --> 00:28:55.600
<v Speaker 2>I have no no agenda or anything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

623
00:28:55.680 --> 00:28:56.513
<v Speaker 2>do you ever fear that that will have a </v>
<v Speaker 2>professional cost just by saying things </v>

624
00:29:00.990 --> 00:29:02.490
<v Speaker 2>quite already?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It does all the time,</v>

625
00:29:02.491 --> 00:29:04.410
<v Speaker 2>but I suppose to some extent,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

626
00:29:04.420 --> 00:29:05.880
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if I feared about that,</v>

627
00:29:05.881 --> 00:29:07.620
<v Speaker 2>I would've stopped a long time ago.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess.</v>

628
00:29:08.460 --> 00:29:13.020
<v Speaker 2>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think there's not a day goes by that I</v>

629
00:29:13.021 --> 00:29:17.820
<v Speaker 2>don't realize I'm fortunate in a way </v>
<v Speaker 2>that people,</v>

630
00:29:17.970 --> 00:29:20.010
<v Speaker 2>for one reason or another want to listen</v>
<v Speaker 2>to me,</v>

631
00:29:20.011 --> 00:29:23.490
<v Speaker 2>or at least I have a public profile and </v>
<v Speaker 2>therefore I have a responsibility.</v>

632
00:29:23.490 --> 00:29:26.370
<v Speaker 2>It seems to me to use that profile </v>
<v Speaker 2>responsibly.</v>

633
00:29:26.371 --> 00:29:29.220
<v Speaker 2>And that means of course,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to try and,</v>

634
00:29:29.240 --> 00:29:29.811
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

635
00:29:29.811 --> 00:29:30.644
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

636
00:29:31.410 --> 00:29:35.580
<v Speaker 2>and popularized science in a way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but also to try and do what I can to,</v>

637
00:29:35.920 --> 00:29:37.830
<v Speaker 2>to have an impact.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So in some sense,</v>

638
00:29:38.160 --> 00:29:40.200
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it goes hand in hand with what I said to</v>

639
00:29:40.201 --> 00:29:41.034
<v Speaker 2>you about my work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My work has no practical significance </v>

640
00:29:42.731 --> 00:29:43.564
<v Speaker 2>whatsoever,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I'm,</v>

641
00:29:44.050 --> 00:29:46.290
<v Speaker 2>but as a human being,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm very political on.</v>

642
00:29:46.340 --> 00:29:49.480
<v Speaker 2>I'm very interested in what's going on </v>
<v Speaker 2>and therefore in some sense,</v>

643
00:29:49.481 --> 00:29:54.400
<v Speaker 2>maybe I make up for the fact that my </v>
<v Speaker 2>work has no usefulness by take advantage</v>

644
00:29:54.401 --> 00:29:57.520
<v Speaker 2>of my public profile to try and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and do useful things.</v>

645
00:29:57.521 --> 00:29:58.354
<v Speaker 2>And one of the useful things can try and</v>
<v Speaker 2>be leased to provoke people to think </v>

646
00:30:01.721 --> 00:30:03.220
<v Speaker 2>about these things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>

647
00:30:03.490 --> 00:30:04.600
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what I do.</v>

648
00:30:04.810 --> 00:30:05.700
<v Speaker 2>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so now let's,</v>

649
00:30:05.770 --> 00:30:07.510
<v Speaker 2>let's get into the work part of it.</v>

650
00:30:07.800 --> 00:30:10.120
<v Speaker 2>Part that apparently has no meaning or </v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

651
00:30:10.121 --> 00:30:12.080
<v Speaker 2>it has lots of meaning but no </v>
<v Speaker 2>significance.</v>

652
00:30:12.710 --> 00:30:14.740
<v Speaker 2>No one has significance in a global </v>
<v Speaker 2>sense,</v>

653
00:30:14.741 --> 00:30:17.160
<v Speaker 2>in a cosmic sense and a in a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in a,</v>

654
00:30:17.161 --> 00:30:19.750
<v Speaker 2>in a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in a existential sense,</v>

655
00:30:20.260 --> 00:30:23.110
<v Speaker 2>but it doesn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it won't cause a better toaster.</v>

656
00:30:23.130 --> 00:30:23.963
<v Speaker 2>Bob Built and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's one of the problems with science </v>

657
00:30:26.440 --> 00:30:27.273
<v Speaker 2>is that it has practical utility.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's obviously not a problem because we </v>

658
00:30:29.501 --> 00:30:31.060
<v Speaker 2>couldn't be doing this show.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We wouldn't.</v>

659
00:30:31.090 --> 00:30:32.530
<v Speaker 2>People wouldn't live as long as they </v>
<v Speaker 2>live.</v>

660
00:30:32.531 --> 00:30:35.290
<v Speaker 2>All our modern society is based on the </v>
<v Speaker 2>results science,</v>

661
00:30:35.530 --> 00:30:38.230
<v Speaker 2>but because science produces technology </v>
<v Speaker 2>that changed our lives,</v>

662
00:30:38.560 --> 00:30:41.440
<v Speaker 2>people suddenly think that unless it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>related to the technology,</v>

663
00:30:41.441 --> 00:30:42.274
<v Speaker 2>it's not an interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whereas I say art doesn't produce </v>

664
00:30:44.111 --> 00:30:46.720
<v Speaker 2>anything practical so people don't </v>
<v Speaker 2>expect them to say,</v>

665
00:30:46.960 --> 00:30:47.793
<v Speaker 2>you know what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that Picasso painting hasn't produced </v>

666
00:30:49.330 --> 00:30:52.420
<v Speaker 2>something that makes me live longer and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

667
00:30:52.460 --> 00:30:54.930
<v Speaker 2>and so because science has that </v>
<v Speaker 2>practical side,</v>

668
00:30:54.970 --> 00:30:56.750
<v Speaker 2>people forget the cultural side that </v>
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

669
00:30:57.040 --> 00:31:00.880
<v Speaker 2>the knowledge side and that's to me is </v>
<v Speaker 2>as important as anything.</v>

670
00:31:01.310 --> 00:31:04.480
<v Speaker 2>What I've,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've quoted a number of times and uh,</v>

671
00:31:04.650 --> 00:31:08.200
<v Speaker 2>but I'll quote it again here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of my favorite statements from a guy</v>

672
00:31:08.201 --> 00:31:09.034
<v Speaker 2>named Robert Wilson who was the director</v>
<v Speaker 2>of the first director of the National </v>

673
00:31:13.210 --> 00:31:14.043
<v Speaker 2>Accelerator Laboratory,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is a particle accelerator near </v>

674
00:31:15.131 --> 00:31:15.964
<v Speaker 2>Chicago,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which accelerates particles to look at </v>

675
00:31:18.251 --> 00:31:19.084
<v Speaker 2>fundamental structure matter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was the largest such machine in the </v>

676
00:31:21.101 --> 00:31:23.220
<v Speaker 2>world until the large Hadron collider </v>
<v Speaker 2>was built in,</v>

677
00:31:23.630 --> 00:31:25.510
<v Speaker 2>in Geneva,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but when it was being built,</v>

678
00:31:26.200 --> 00:31:27.033
<v Speaker 2>he was called by Congress to testify and</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was asked will it aid in the defense </v>

679
00:31:30.881 --> 00:31:33.490
<v Speaker 2>of the nation?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he gave a beautiful statement,</v>

680
00:31:33.491 --> 00:31:34.324
<v Speaker 2>but at the end of it was basically no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it won't help aid in the defense of the </v>

681
00:31:37.781 --> 00:31:38.614
<v Speaker 2>nation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It'll just help keep the nation worth </v>

682
00:31:39.491 --> 00:31:40.440
<v Speaker 2>defending,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

683
00:31:40.750 --> 00:31:42.550
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that actually is really beautiful.</v>

684
00:31:42.551 --> 00:31:44.320
<v Speaker 2>I think it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's why I quote them.</v>

685
00:31:44.380 --> 00:31:45.420
<v Speaker 2>So that's sort of it.</v>

686
00:31:45.510 --> 00:31:50.510
<v Speaker 2>It's a problem of funding things in a </v>
<v Speaker 2>way because if you fund something,</v>

687
00:31:50.681 --> 00:31:51.514
<v Speaker 2>people want results and what you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>saying is basically the whole </v>

688
00:31:53.981 --> 00:31:56.710
<v Speaker 2>playground.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If science is entitled to that.</v>

689
00:31:56.711 --> 00:31:59.680
<v Speaker 2>And it's a real problem now in </v>
<v Speaker 2>government funding and in the public.</v>

690
00:31:59.681 --> 00:32:01.490
<v Speaker 2>People seem to want to fund things based</v>
<v Speaker 2>on,</v>

691
00:32:01.491 --> 00:32:02.324
<v Speaker 2>in fact,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wrote another piece on the House </v>

692
00:32:04.450 --> 00:32:05.283
<v Speaker 2>Science Committee,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which basically wanting to require an </v>

693
00:32:07.090 --> 00:32:07.923
<v Speaker 2>did to some extent scientists in their </v>
<v Speaker 2>grant applications to justify why what </v>

694
00:32:11.201 --> 00:32:14.950
<v Speaker 2>they're doing is in the national </v>
<v Speaker 2>interest and the net doesn't necessarily</v>

695
00:32:14.951 --> 00:32:16.840
<v Speaker 2>have anything to do with science.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

696
00:32:16.930 --> 00:32:19.360
<v Speaker 2>the point is that it seems to me the </v>
<v Speaker 2>natural,</v>

697
00:32:19.390 --> 00:32:23.220
<v Speaker 2>the national interest is an increasing </v>
<v Speaker 2>our knowledge and,</v>

698
00:32:23.221 --> 00:32:25.210
<v Speaker 2>and it's not in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so if you,</v>

699
00:32:25.630 --> 00:32:28.780
<v Speaker 2>if you require things directly to have a</v>
<v Speaker 2>practical application,</v>

700
00:32:29.080 --> 00:32:31.990
<v Speaker 2>then you're going to miss almost </v>
<v Speaker 2>everything.</v>

701
00:32:32.340 --> 00:32:33.173
<v Speaker 2>You,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's already been well documented that </v>

702
00:32:34.271 --> 00:32:35.104
<v Speaker 2>probably 50 percent of the current gross</v>
<v Speaker 2>national product of this country is </v>

703
00:32:37.421 --> 00:32:42.410
<v Speaker 2>based on fundamental curiosity driven </v>
<v Speaker 2>research that was done a generation ago.</v>

704
00:32:42.650 --> 00:32:43.610
<v Speaker 2>Accidents,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

705
00:32:43.620 --> 00:32:45.910
<v Speaker 2>discovery of penicillin.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They weren't looking for antibiotics.</v>

706
00:32:45.911 --> 00:32:48.410
<v Speaker 2>So even the development of transistor </v>
<v Speaker 2>wasn't.</v>

707
00:32:49.120 --> 00:32:49.953
<v Speaker 2>If,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if people had said we need to make </v>

708
00:32:50.871 --> 00:32:51.704
<v Speaker 2>better computers back at the time when </v>
<v Speaker 2>they were using wheels and other things </v>

709
00:32:53.901 --> 00:32:56.470
<v Speaker 2>and they would have missed the use of </v>
<v Speaker 2>transistors.</v>

710
00:32:56.471 --> 00:32:58.970
<v Speaker 2>So all of the things that have changed </v>
<v Speaker 2>our lives,</v>

711
00:32:58.971 --> 00:33:02.900
<v Speaker 2>even the worldwide web,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which was developed at at Geneva,</v>

712
00:33:03.020 --> 00:33:03.853
<v Speaker 2>the home of the large Hadron collider to</v>
<v Speaker 2>help scientists communicate in large </v>

713
00:33:07.221 --> 00:33:10.040
<v Speaker 2>experiments when you have 10,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>scientists around the world,</v>

714
00:33:10.310 --> 00:33:11.143
<v Speaker 2>it was important for them to be able to </v>
<v Speaker 2>exchange results without worrying about </v>

715
00:33:13.461 --> 00:33:15.380
<v Speaker 2>where the results were and being able to</v>
<v Speaker 2>communicate.</v>

716
00:33:15.620 --> 00:33:19.100
<v Speaker 2>That's what developed the worldwide web.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And of course that changed the world.</v>

717
00:33:19.101 --> 00:33:24.050
<v Speaker 2>So you need to support fundamental </v>
<v Speaker 2>curiosity driven research.</v>

718
00:33:24.051 --> 00:33:24.884
<v Speaker 2>If you stop doing that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then not only do we suffer as a species </v>

719
00:33:28.790 --> 00:33:31.340
<v Speaker 2>by law,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not our learning going not increasing,</v>

720
00:33:31.640 --> 00:33:32.473
<v Speaker 2>but ultimately the spinoffs that are </v>
<v Speaker 2>going to change our lives are not gonna </v>

721
00:33:34.820 --> 00:33:35.260
<v Speaker 2>occur.</v>

722
00:33:35.260 --> 00:33:36.093
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you mentioned Carl Sagan before and </v>

723
00:33:37.521 --> 00:33:38.354
<v Speaker 2>my,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my scientific awakening was a little </v>

724
00:33:39.231 --> 00:33:40.580
<v Speaker 2>slow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I hate to admit it,</v>

725
00:33:40.700 --> 00:33:41.533
<v Speaker 2>I was always into Scifi when I was </v>
<v Speaker 2>growing up and star wars and all that </v>

726
00:33:43.881 --> 00:33:46.100
<v Speaker 2>stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but my real scientific awakening,</v>

727
00:33:46.130 --> 00:33:46.963
<v Speaker 2>I saw the movie contact and I'd eaten </v>
<v Speaker 2>pot brownies before and I thought I was </v>

728
00:33:50.961 --> 00:33:52.700
<v Speaker 2>going to see,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think air force one,</v>

729
00:33:52.701 --> 00:33:54.230
<v Speaker 2>but it was sold out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I just went into,</v>

730
00:33:54.580 --> 00:33:55.413
<v Speaker 2>I had no idea what it was about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it didn't really know much about cross </v>

731
00:33:57.241 --> 00:33:57.801
<v Speaker 2>Hagen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>

732
00:33:57.801 --> 00:34:00.870
<v Speaker 2>the opening Panorama universe in my mind</v>
<v Speaker 2>on pop round,</v>

733
00:34:00.871 --> 00:34:01.704
<v Speaker 2>he's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

734
00:34:02.120 --> 00:34:03.980
<v Speaker 2>it exploded.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I sensitive,</v>

735
00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:05.510
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Every Carl Sagan Book and all that.</v>

736
00:34:05.511 --> 00:34:07.310
<v Speaker 2>Kind of what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what was that moment for you?</v>

737
00:34:07.311 --> 00:34:09.340
<v Speaker 2>I suspect it was a lot younger than it </v>
<v Speaker 2>was.</v>

738
00:34:09.341 --> 00:34:11.210
<v Speaker 2>It was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was a little younger and a lot earlier</v>

739
00:34:11.240 --> 00:34:12.073
<v Speaker 2>because a lot older.</v>

740
00:34:12.140 --> 00:34:14.480
<v Speaker 2>But I'm actually,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

741
00:34:14.481 --> 00:34:15.160
<v Speaker 2>well I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

742
00:34:15.160 --> 00:34:15.993
<v Speaker 2>it's hard.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not sure there was an epiphany in </v>

743
00:34:17.211 --> 00:34:18.220
<v Speaker 2>that way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there was a.</v>

744
00:34:18.550 --> 00:34:23.550
<v Speaker 2>But the first thing I can remember was </v>
<v Speaker 2>when I was in grade six,</v>

745
00:34:24.380 --> 00:34:29.380
<v Speaker 2>I'm reading a book about Galileo and um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

746
00:34:30.830 --> 00:34:34.790
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it seemed romantic and remarkable to</v>

747
00:34:34.791 --> 00:34:35.624
<v Speaker 2>me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The fact that he was the first one to </v>

748
00:34:36.861 --> 00:34:40.580
<v Speaker 2>look up that the moons of Jupiter and it</v>
<v Speaker 2>changed everything and,</v>

749
00:34:40.700 --> 00:34:45.700
<v Speaker 2>and also the courage he had at or,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or lack thereof at times to,</v>

750
00:34:46.520 --> 00:34:47.353
<v Speaker 2>to confront conventional wisdom.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That seemed to me to be a romantic </v>

751
00:34:50.481 --> 00:34:51.314
<v Speaker 2>adventure that captured my imagination.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's probably one of the reasons </v>

752
00:34:55.071 --> 00:34:55.904
<v Speaker 2>why write books is because it was books </v>
<v Speaker 2>about him and then books by people like </v>

753
00:34:59.900 --> 00:35:00.733
<v Speaker 2>Isaac Asimov,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well before Carl Sagan and George Gamma </v>

754
00:35:03.861 --> 00:35:06.380
<v Speaker 2>of and Albert Einstein,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then Richard,</v>

755
00:35:06.620 --> 00:35:07.453
<v Speaker 2>Richard Feynman books by people like </v>
<v Speaker 2>that got me excited as a young person </v>

756
00:35:10.380 --> 00:35:11.213
<v Speaker 2>about the romantic adventure to be the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to to be the first to understand </v>

757
00:35:14.481 --> 00:35:15.500
<v Speaker 2>something new about the world.</v>

758
00:35:15.500 --> 00:35:16.333
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so I returned the favor and I'm old </v>

759
00:35:18.441 --> 00:35:20.660
<v Speaker 2>enough now that it's for me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very satisfying.</v>

760
00:35:20.661 --> 00:35:23.360
<v Speaker 2>Although a little depressing to think </v>
<v Speaker 2>how old I am and what I mean.</v>

761
00:35:23.660 --> 00:35:24.860
<v Speaker 2>Scientists now say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

762
00:35:24.861 --> 00:35:25.694
<v Speaker 2>I read the physics of Star Trek and </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what turned me on to be with </v>

763
00:35:27.530 --> 00:35:28.363
<v Speaker 2>scientists.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

764
00:35:28.580 --> 00:35:30.890
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it was those popular books and I,</v>

765
00:35:30.891 --> 00:35:33.500
<v Speaker 2>and that's why,</v>
<v Speaker 2>although it takes time out of,</v>

766
00:35:33.980 --> 00:35:36.230
<v Speaker 2>out of my research directly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

767
00:35:36.980 --> 00:35:39.180
<v Speaker 2>I'm not sure which is more useful in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>long run.</v>

768
00:35:39.210 --> 00:35:40.043
<v Speaker 2>And besides I don't have control.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have to do what I have to do when </v>

769
00:35:42.151 --> 00:35:42.901
<v Speaker 2>writing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's one of them,</v>

770
00:35:42.901 --> 00:35:43.734
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's very satisfying to be able to </v>

771
00:35:45.181 --> 00:35:49.560
<v Speaker 2>connect because the importance of a </v>
<v Speaker 2>university or of the research enterprise</v>

772
00:35:49.830 --> 00:35:50.663
<v Speaker 2>is two fold.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's one of the reasons why my </v>

773
00:35:51.871 --> 00:35:55.950
<v Speaker 2>origins project is twofold.</v>
<v Speaker 2>University Research University should be</v>

774
00:35:55.951 --> 00:35:56.784
<v Speaker 2>based on the creation of knowledge,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if you don't disseminate the </v>

775
00:35:59.161 --> 00:36:01.630
<v Speaker 2>knowledge,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's impotent so it has to be to,</v>

776
00:36:01.700 --> 00:36:02.270
<v Speaker 2>to fold.</v>

777
00:36:02.270 --> 00:36:03.103
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so,</v>

778
00:36:03.320 --> 00:36:04.153
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I like to be involved in both for some </v>

779
00:36:05.521 --> 00:36:06.121
<v Speaker 2>reason.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

780
00:36:06.121 --> 00:36:06.954
<v Speaker 2>So the origins project,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're trying to figure out the origins </v>

781
00:36:08.731 --> 00:36:12.750
<v Speaker 2>of humans and the universe and we're </v>
<v Speaker 2>looking at the origins of everything.</v>

782
00:36:12.751 --> 00:36:13.584
<v Speaker 2>It's [inaudible].</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a wonderful playground because we </v>

783
00:36:15.841 --> 00:36:16.674
<v Speaker 2>look at everything from the origins of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the universe to the origins of life to </v>

784
00:36:19.201 --> 00:36:21.000
<v Speaker 2>the origins of violence and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

785
00:36:21.030 --> 00:36:21.863
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

786
00:36:21.990 --> 00:36:22.860
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

787
00:36:23.310 --> 00:36:24.390
<v Speaker 2>we're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're having,</v>

788
00:36:24.391 --> 00:36:26.100
<v Speaker 2>we're having and the origins of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>future,</v>

789
00:36:26.101 --> 00:36:28.170
<v Speaker 2>we're having a workshop,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

790
00:36:28.220 --> 00:36:29.053
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in February and the AI and its </v>

791
00:36:30.511 --> 00:36:32.790
<v Speaker 2>challenges.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if you think about it,</v>

792
00:36:33.150 --> 00:36:33.983
<v Speaker 2>forefront questions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a relationship always between </v>

793
00:36:35.941 --> 00:36:38.610
<v Speaker 2>the future and the past.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And forefront questions are always based</v>

794
00:36:38.700 --> 00:36:41.070
<v Speaker 2>about the origin.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's the origin of disease?</v>

795
00:36:41.071 --> 00:36:46.071
<v Speaker 2>What's the origin of of intelligence and</v>
<v Speaker 2>so as a curious person,</v>

796
00:36:46.860 --> 00:36:49.200
<v Speaker 2>I can go well beyond just my area of </v>
<v Speaker 2>physics,</v>

797
00:36:49.201 --> 00:36:51.510
<v Speaker 2>which tends to be more related to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>origin of the universe,</v>

798
00:36:51.511 --> 00:36:54.150
<v Speaker 2>when which has gotten me into it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to all these other questions.</v>

799
00:36:54.150 --> 00:36:54.983
<v Speaker 2>I'm like a kid in a candy shop.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I get to meet and work with the most </v>

800
00:36:59.041 --> 00:37:01.680
<v Speaker 2>interesting people in the world and </v>
<v Speaker 2>learn a lot about a lot of things.</v>

801
00:37:01.681 --> 00:37:04.380
<v Speaker 2>So it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's really self indulgence,</v>

802
00:37:04.410 --> 00:37:08.400
<v Speaker 2>which is most of my life is based on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's bringing a lot of good to a lot</v>

803
00:37:08.401 --> 00:37:09.234
<v Speaker 2>of people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Me Self indulgence and individuality is </v>

804
00:37:11.761 --> 00:37:12.331
<v Speaker 2>good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

805
00:37:12.331 --> 00:37:13.200
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

806
00:37:13.500 --> 00:37:14.333
<v Speaker 2>that's the other thing I guess I want to</v>
<v Speaker 2>say is that most people become </v>

807
00:37:16.501 --> 00:37:18.570
<v Speaker 2>scientists not because they want to save</v>
<v Speaker 2>the world.</v>

808
00:37:19.140 --> 00:37:21.810
<v Speaker 2>It's because they like doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's fun and,</v>

809
00:37:21.860 --> 00:37:23.940
<v Speaker 2>and there's nothing and that's fine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

810
00:37:24.210 --> 00:37:25.043
<v Speaker 2>I tell kids,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's when they asked me what they </v>

811
00:37:27.901 --> 00:37:28.331
<v Speaker 2>should do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I say,</v>

812
00:37:28.331 --> 00:37:30.090
<v Speaker 2>do what you enjoy because if you don't </v>
<v Speaker 2>enjoy it,</v>

813
00:37:30.091 --> 00:37:32.730
<v Speaker 2>you're not going to do well anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I do science,</v>

814
00:37:32.760 --> 00:37:33.593
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's great if it has an impact in one </v>

815
00:37:35.221 --> 00:37:37.870
<v Speaker 2>way or another,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I do it because I enjoy it and,</v>

816
00:37:37.890 --> 00:37:40.470
<v Speaker 2>and that and I and I am an unabashed </v>
<v Speaker 2>about that.</v>

817
00:37:40.560 --> 00:37:42.720
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I'm very proud that on this show,</v>

818
00:37:42.750 --> 00:37:43.583
<v Speaker 2>which I try to bring on people of all </v>
<v Speaker 2>kinds of beliefs and political </v>

819
00:37:46.231 --> 00:37:47.064
<v Speaker 2>persuasions and all that stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I get tons of emails from religious </v>

820
00:37:49.111 --> 00:37:51.390
<v Speaker 2>people even though they know that I'm </v>
<v Speaker 2>not a believer in that stuff,</v>

821
00:37:51.630 --> 00:37:53.610
<v Speaker 2>so we don't have to dive too much into </v>
<v Speaker 2>the atheism thing.</v>

822
00:37:53.611 --> 00:37:54.444
<v Speaker 2>But can you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how about you give me the best sell job </v>

823
00:37:56.281 --> 00:37:58.620
<v Speaker 2>in like three minutes on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>on the big bang,</v>

824
00:37:58.621 --> 00:37:59.454
<v Speaker 2>like just something that someone that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that is a believer of religion could </v>

825
00:38:02.431 --> 00:38:04.740
<v Speaker 2>say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well maybe there's something here.</v>

826
00:38:04.830 --> 00:38:06.870
<v Speaker 2>Maybe there's some.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well the point is it's,</v>

827
00:38:06.910 --> 00:38:07.480
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

828
00:38:07.480 --> 00:38:08.313
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

829
00:38:08.350 --> 00:38:11.490
<v Speaker 2>it's sad that I have to do that because.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Did I leave too much with that question?</v>

830
00:38:11.491 --> 00:38:12.850
<v Speaker 2>Maybe I should untangled them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

831
00:38:12.851 --> 00:38:13.231
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

832
00:38:13.231 --> 00:38:14.760
<v Speaker 2>But I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one,</v>

833
00:38:15.070 --> 00:38:15.903
<v Speaker 2>it makes it sound like the big bang is </v>
<v Speaker 2>on a different footing than the fact </v>

834
00:38:17.851 --> 00:38:18.840
<v Speaker 2>that the earth is round.</v>

835
00:38:19.260 --> 00:38:22.140
<v Speaker 2>It's not the big bang happened.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Same with evolution.</v>

836
00:38:22.141 --> 00:38:23.040
<v Speaker 2>It's not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

837
00:38:23.041 --> 00:38:25.350
<v Speaker 2>people get hung up in the word theory.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

838
00:38:25.380 --> 00:38:26.730
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>someone just wrote me and said,</v>

839
00:38:26.731 --> 00:38:27.564
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

840
00:38:27.660 --> 00:38:28.860
<v Speaker 2>it's a theory.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I said,</v>

841
00:38:28.861 --> 00:38:30.120
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>gravity is a theory too,</v>

842
00:38:30.121 --> 00:38:32.610
<v Speaker 2>so if you don't believe in walk up to </v>
<v Speaker 2>the 10th floor window.</v>

843
00:38:33.630 --> 00:38:34.463
<v Speaker 2>But the point is a theory in science </v>
<v Speaker 2>means it's been tested theories a very </v>

844
00:38:37.001 --> 00:38:37.834
<v Speaker 2>high level in science.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It means it's satisfied the test </v>

845
00:38:40.150 --> 00:38:45.150
<v Speaker 2>experiment over and over and over again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the fact that the universe began,</v>

846
00:38:47.320 --> 00:38:48.153
<v Speaker 2>that the universe was smaller than it is</v>
<v Speaker 2>today and smaller and smaller and </v>

847
00:38:50.141 --> 00:38:52.840
<v Speaker 2>smaller and was once contained in a </v>
<v Speaker 2>microscopic region.</v>

848
00:38:53.050 --> 00:38:58.050
<v Speaker 2>13 point 8 billion years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That expanded dramatically is,</v>

849
00:38:58.750 --> 00:38:59.980
<v Speaker 2>is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is a fact.</v>

850
00:39:00.610 --> 00:39:01.443
<v Speaker 2>And it and everything we sit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we recognize about the university is </v>

851
00:39:04.061 --> 00:39:06.940
<v Speaker 2>only understandable in that context.</v>

852
00:39:07.090 --> 00:39:09.790
<v Speaker 2>There are lots of independent ways to </v>
<v Speaker 2>measure the age of the universe.</v>

853
00:39:09.791 --> 00:39:11.500
<v Speaker 2>And we come up with 13 point 8 billion </v>
<v Speaker 2>years.</v>

854
00:39:11.650 --> 00:39:13.600
<v Speaker 2>We measure the fact the university </v>
<v Speaker 2>expanding,</v>

855
00:39:13.870 --> 00:39:14.703
<v Speaker 2>working backwards,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was smaller than it is and if we </v>

856
00:39:16.630 --> 00:39:17.463
<v Speaker 2>extrapolate back and say what happened </v>
<v Speaker 2>when the smaller we make predictions </v>

857
00:39:21.730 --> 00:39:26.730
<v Speaker 2>about things that we hadn't seen before,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people say evolution or the Big Bang our</v>

858
00:39:27.460 --> 00:39:29.650
<v Speaker 2>historical science because no one was </v>
<v Speaker 2>around.</v>

859
00:39:29.651 --> 00:39:31.330
<v Speaker 2>They offer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean no one was around to know,</v>

860
00:39:31.331 --> 00:39:32.320
<v Speaker 2>so how do you know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I say,</v>

861
00:39:32.560 --> 00:39:33.393
<v Speaker 2>well the point is all sciences </v>
<v Speaker 2>historical because all science is based </v>

862
00:39:37.151 --> 00:39:40.930
<v Speaker 2>on explaining some observations but </v>
<v Speaker 2>done,</v>

863
00:39:40.931 --> 00:39:41.764
<v Speaker 2>but then making predictions of things </v>
<v Speaker 2>that haven't been done and both </v>

864
00:39:44.470 --> 00:39:45.303
<v Speaker 2>evolution and the big bang make </v>
<v Speaker 2>predictions about things that weren't </v>

865
00:39:48.581 --> 00:39:49.820
<v Speaker 2>seen before.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If,</v>

866
00:39:49.850 --> 00:39:53.380
<v Speaker 2>if the big bang happened,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we predicted it was predicted.</v>

867
00:39:53.381 --> 00:39:56.650
<v Speaker 2>Although a lot of sciences didn't know </v>
<v Speaker 2>about it until after the fact that there</v>

868
00:39:56.651 --> 00:39:59.920
<v Speaker 2>should be a universal background of </v>
<v Speaker 2>radiation coming at us.</v>

869
00:40:00.490 --> 00:40:02.590
<v Speaker 2>That was once 3000 degrees in </v>
<v Speaker 2>temperature.</v>

870
00:40:02.591 --> 00:40:03.424
<v Speaker 2>That's now three degrees.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's been measured with exquisite </v>

871
00:40:05.411 --> 00:40:08.050
<v Speaker 2>prediction.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Exquisite precision.</v>

872
00:40:08.051 --> 00:40:08.884
<v Speaker 2>Sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And also we predict that 25 percent of </v>

873
00:40:12.551 --> 00:40:13.384
<v Speaker 2>the universe should be helium and almost</v>
<v Speaker 2>75 percent of the industry of the </v>

874
00:40:15.251 --> 00:40:18.400
<v Speaker 2>hydrogen and one part in 10 billion new </v>
<v Speaker 2>universe will be lithium.</v>

875
00:40:18.670 --> 00:40:21.160
<v Speaker 2>We go out and measure that 10 orders of </v>
<v Speaker 2>magnitude.</v>

876
00:40:21.460 --> 00:40:23.740
<v Speaker 2>So we make tons of predictions of </v>
<v Speaker 2>things.</v>

877
00:40:24.010 --> 00:40:27.340
<v Speaker 2>That's what science is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not just a story like religion.</v>

878
00:40:27.670 --> 00:40:28.503
<v Speaker 2>It makes predictions and if those </v>
<v Speaker 2>predictions don't agree with the </v>

879
00:40:30.401 --> 00:40:31.750
<v Speaker 2>observations,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're wrong.</v>

880
00:40:31.760 --> 00:40:32.593
<v Speaker 2>So we throw the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we throw it out like yesterday's </v>

881
00:40:34.331 --> 00:40:36.830
<v Speaker 2>newspaper.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the history,</v>

882
00:40:36.860 --> 00:40:40.330
<v Speaker 2>that word historical science,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which a lot of fundamentalist use to try</v>

883
00:40:40.331 --> 00:40:43.830
<v Speaker 2>and discredit evolution,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the big bang is nonsense because they're</v>

884
00:40:43.840 --> 00:40:45.610
<v Speaker 2>not historical anymore than anything </v>
<v Speaker 2>else.</v>

885
00:40:45.611 --> 00:40:48.850
<v Speaker 2>They make predictions about observations</v>
<v Speaker 2>that are gonna be made in the future.</v>

886
00:40:49.060 --> 00:40:49.893
<v Speaker 2>And every observation we made about the </v>
<v Speaker 2>university's consistent only with that </v>

887
00:40:53.471 --> 00:40:55.480
<v Speaker 2>picture and inconsistent with any other </v>
<v Speaker 2>ideas.</v>

888
00:40:55.530 --> 00:40:56.363
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you would say the evidence that we </v>

889
00:40:57.341 --> 00:40:59.770
<v Speaker 2>have for the big bang is as much </v>
<v Speaker 2>evidence as we have.</v>

890
00:40:59.771 --> 00:41:00.940
<v Speaker 2>The dinosaurs existed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

891
00:41:00.941 --> 00:41:02.370
<v Speaker 2>It's just a different that we have </v>
<v Speaker 2>physical.</v>

892
00:41:03.010 --> 00:41:03.843
<v Speaker 2>Moreover,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we have evidence that dinosaurs didn't </v>

893
00:41:05.021 --> 00:41:06.630
<v Speaker 2>exist when humans,</v>
<v Speaker 2>humans exist,</v>

894
00:41:06.640 --> 00:41:09.030
<v Speaker 2>no matter what they show in that is </v>
<v Speaker 2>wrong,</v>

895
00:41:09.031 --> 00:41:11.790
<v Speaker 2>is that it's easy to say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

896
00:41:11.800 --> 00:41:13.690
<v Speaker 2>I've been there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would there the day it opened.</v>

897
00:41:13.691 --> 00:41:17.080
<v Speaker 2>And how you feel about that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was a remarkable experience.</v>

898
00:41:17.081 --> 00:41:18.410
<v Speaker 2>I was there that they opened.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

899
00:41:18.411 --> 00:41:22.570
<v Speaker 2>I flew to Cincinnati and then into </v>
<v Speaker 2>Kentucky on the other side.</v>

900
00:41:22.571 --> 00:41:23.404
<v Speaker 2>Where was that morning to lead to be the</v>
<v Speaker 2>keynote speaker at a protest that </v>

901
00:41:26.080 --> 00:41:27.600
<v Speaker 2>morning.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then um,</v>

902
00:41:27.740 --> 00:41:28.900
<v Speaker 2>at,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because it is,</v>

903
00:41:28.950 --> 00:41:29.783
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

904
00:41:30.100 --> 00:41:33.160
<v Speaker 2>it's that willingness.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The Saturn,</v>

905
00:41:33.380 --> 00:41:34.490
<v Speaker 2>it's child abuse.</v>

906
00:41:35.000 --> 00:41:38.190
<v Speaker 2>The idea is okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they believe something and,</v>

907
00:41:38.250 --> 00:41:41.450
<v Speaker 2>and therefore they don't want kids to </v>
<v Speaker 2>know what really happened.</v>

908
00:41:42.110 --> 00:41:42.943
<v Speaker 2>They don't want kids to know that </v>
<v Speaker 2>evolution happened because somehow it </v>

909
00:41:44.451 --> 00:41:45.284
<v Speaker 2>might reduce their faith in God.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so the idea that you want your kids </v>

910
00:41:49.641 --> 00:41:53.630
<v Speaker 2>to not know how the universe works </v>
<v Speaker 2>because for fear that the loser faith is</v>

911
00:41:53.631 --> 00:41:56.750
<v Speaker 2>no different than the Taliban when they </v>
<v Speaker 2>won't teach the kids anything but,</v>

912
00:41:56.790 --> 00:41:59.440
<v Speaker 2>but memorizing the Koran and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

913
00:41:59.700 --> 00:42:02.900
<v Speaker 2>and so it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's worse than ignorance.</v>

914
00:42:02.901 --> 00:42:03.390
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

915
00:42:03.390 --> 00:42:04.840
<v Speaker 2>it's child abuse.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So W,</v>

916
00:42:05.010 --> 00:42:06.980
<v Speaker 2>so I went there and protested and then I</v>
<v Speaker 2>actually,</v>

917
00:42:07.310 --> 00:42:08.143
<v Speaker 2>I had credentials,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was a commentator for NPR and I went </v>

918
00:42:11.211 --> 00:42:13.880
<v Speaker 2>up to the right afterwards and they </v>
<v Speaker 2>recognize me and they said,</v>

919
00:42:13.881 --> 00:42:14.740
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Professor Kraus,</v>

920
00:42:14.760 --> 00:42:16.640
<v Speaker 2>your credentials didn't arrive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can't go into the museum.</v>

921
00:42:17.060 --> 00:42:18.140
<v Speaker 2>So I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's okay.</v>

922
00:42:18.141 --> 00:42:18.974
<v Speaker 2>I happen to have a crew from pbs and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and BBC are that are following me right </v>

923
00:42:22.521 --> 00:42:22.610
<v Speaker 2>now.</v>

924
00:42:22.610 --> 00:42:24.740
<v Speaker 2>Do you mind if they filmed me not being </v>
<v Speaker 2>allowed in the museum?</v>

925
00:42:25.160 --> 00:42:27.470
<v Speaker 2>And then I got,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got a tour by at that time,</v>

926
00:42:27.471 --> 00:42:28.910
<v Speaker 2>the vice president of museum.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it was,</v>

927
00:42:29.390 --> 00:42:30.530
<v Speaker 2>it was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was shocking.</v>

928
00:42:30.531 --> 00:42:32.210
<v Speaker 2>It's an amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They do a bait and switch.</v>

929
00:42:32.211 --> 00:42:33.410
<v Speaker 2>It was amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>

930
00:42:33.770 --> 00:42:34.603
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they start out quite upfront in saying </v>

931
00:42:37.130 --> 00:42:39.930
<v Speaker 2>reason and faith.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They brought it in the front door,</v>

932
00:42:39.980 --> 00:42:40.813
<v Speaker 2>reason to faith why should,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they point out that the two are </v>

933
00:42:42.561 --> 00:42:44.620
<v Speaker 2>different and then they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they,</v>

934
00:42:44.621 --> 00:42:45.920
<v Speaker 2>and they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they are,</v>

935
00:42:45.921 --> 00:42:47.690
<v Speaker 2>you should believe in reason,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you should believe in faith.</v>

936
00:42:47.691 --> 00:42:48.524
<v Speaker 2>And then,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then they halfway through the </v>

937
00:42:50.001 --> 00:42:51.740
<v Speaker 2>museum,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they make it seem like a natural history</v>

938
00:42:51.741 --> 00:42:54.290
<v Speaker 2>museum.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they do this bait and switch and uh,</v>

939
00:42:54.650 --> 00:42:55.483
<v Speaker 2>but the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's hysterical because they have </v>

940
00:42:56.271 --> 00:42:58.970
<v Speaker 2>the garden of Eden With Adam and eve </v>
<v Speaker 2>both politically correct.</v>

941
00:42:58.970 --> 00:43:02.120
<v Speaker 2>Adam is in grass up to here and eve has </v>
<v Speaker 2>hair down to their,</v>

942
00:43:02.330 --> 00:43:04.070
<v Speaker 2>but they have dinosaurs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

943
00:43:04.071 --> 00:43:06.640
<v Speaker 2>in the garden of Eden of course.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they trying to source wrecks,</v>

944
00:43:06.641 --> 00:43:07.430
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is there,</v>

945
00:43:07.430 --> 00:43:08.263
<v Speaker 2>it's got sharp teeth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why everything was a vegetarian in the </v>

946
00:43:10.461 --> 00:43:12.300
<v Speaker 2>garden of Eden.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You may not have realized that but,</v>

947
00:43:12.350 --> 00:43:13.183
<v Speaker 2>but if you go to the museum will </v>
<v Speaker 2>discover that and it's so they could </v>

948
00:43:15.501 --> 00:43:16.334
<v Speaker 2>open pineapples so they could eat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's why the tyrannosaurs rex had </v>

949
00:43:18.861 --> 00:43:19.790
<v Speaker 2>sharp teeth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

950
00:43:19.880 --> 00:43:21.370
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I knew I was going to learn something.</v>

951
00:43:21.380 --> 00:43:24.290
<v Speaker 2>There you go with you here today.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm glad that that will end up being.</v>

952
00:43:24.330 --> 00:43:24.800
<v Speaker 2>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We will.</v>

953
00:43:24.800 --> 00:43:26.150
<v Speaker 2>We only have a couple minutes left.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm curious,</v>

954
00:43:26.570 --> 00:43:30.380
<v Speaker 2>do you find that you have colleagues </v>
<v Speaker 2>that believe in everything that you just</v>

955
00:43:30.381 --> 00:43:31.270
<v Speaker 2>said there are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

956
00:43:31.280 --> 00:43:32.380
<v Speaker 2>everything that we've talked about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

957
00:43:32.530 --> 00:43:34.880
<v Speaker 2>the ideas of everything you've said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but at the same time,</v>

958
00:43:34.910 --> 00:43:37.310
<v Speaker 2>are there some people that do take the </v>
<v Speaker 2>leap of faith?</v>

959
00:43:37.500 --> 00:43:38.170
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sure.</v>

960
00:43:38.170 --> 00:43:41.060
<v Speaker 2>Then believe in things that aren't </v>
<v Speaker 2>quantifiable at the same time.</v>

961
00:43:41.061 --> 00:43:41.960
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>For the first,</v>

962
00:43:41.961 --> 00:43:44.950
<v Speaker 2>by the way we should say as scientists,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we should never use the word belief.</v>

963
00:43:45.140 --> 00:43:45.951
<v Speaker 2>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

964
00:43:45.951 --> 00:43:47.300
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's just.</v>

965
00:43:47.400 --> 00:43:48.233
<v Speaker 2>I fall into that trap to believing is </v>
<v Speaker 2>not part of science is is it likely or </v>

966
00:43:52.371 --> 00:43:53.570
<v Speaker 2>unlikely,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's the question.</v>

967
00:43:53.620 --> 00:43:54.453
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but of course their religious </v>

968
00:43:55.191 --> 00:43:56.930
<v Speaker 2>scientists,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but as I like to say,</v>

969
00:43:56.931 --> 00:43:58.430
<v Speaker 2>there are scientists who are </v>
<v Speaker 2>Republicans.</v>

970
00:43:58.431 --> 00:44:00.950
<v Speaker 2>I mean the scientists,</v>
<v Speaker 2>believe it or not,</v>

971
00:44:00.951 --> 00:44:01.784
<v Speaker 2>are human beings and human beings are in</v>
<v Speaker 2>some sense hardwired to believe to </v>

972
00:44:05.061 --> 00:44:07.240
<v Speaker 2>mutually inconsistent things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>At the same time,</v>

973
00:44:07.910 --> 00:44:11.030
<v Speaker 2>I often say that we all have to believe </v>
<v Speaker 2>in impossible things before breakfast.</v>

974
00:44:11.031 --> 00:44:13.640
<v Speaker 2>Just to get up in the morning,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have to believe you like your job or</v>

975
00:44:13.641 --> 00:44:14.474
<v Speaker 2>your spouse or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yet we all invent stories to go by and </v>

976
00:44:17.571 --> 00:44:19.040
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

977
00:44:19.090 --> 00:44:19.923
<v Speaker 2>there are scientists religious as long </v>
<v Speaker 2>as they don't let that religious faith </v>

978
00:44:23.200 --> 00:44:24.033
<v Speaker 2>interfere with their work,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't matter and the good </v>

979
00:44:27.231 --> 00:44:28.490
<v Speaker 2>scientists so that way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

980
00:44:28.820 --> 00:44:29.780
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the,</v>

981
00:44:30.260 --> 00:44:31.093
<v Speaker 2>making the claim that there are </v>
<v Speaker 2>scientists who are religious does not </v>

982
00:44:32.971 --> 00:44:34.110
<v Speaker 2>mean that they're compatible.</v>

983
00:44:34.500 --> 00:44:39.360
<v Speaker 2>Neither does making the claim that </v>
<v Speaker 2>science derives from religion because it</v>

984
00:44:39.361 --> 00:44:40.120
<v Speaker 2>does,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

985
00:44:40.120 --> 00:44:40.953
<v Speaker 2>but in the history of West,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at least all of universities were once </v>

986
00:44:46.291 --> 00:44:48.150
<v Speaker 2>religious institutions because as I like</v>
<v Speaker 2>to say,</v>

987
00:44:48.170 --> 00:44:49.003
<v Speaker 2>the 17th century,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the church was the national science </v>

988
00:44:51.241 --> 00:44:54.150
<v Speaker 2>foundation was the only plate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you want it to get money,</v>

989
00:44:54.570 --> 00:44:57.280
<v Speaker 2>then that was the place to get it if you</v>
<v Speaker 2>want it to support your ideas.</v>

990
00:44:57.281 --> 00:45:00.450
<v Speaker 2>So it's not too surprising that science </v>
<v Speaker 2>grew of religion.</v>

991
00:45:00.451 --> 00:45:01.284
<v Speaker 2>But as I also like to say and again to </v>
<v Speaker 2>plugged set in the APP and to say it in </v>

992
00:45:04.231 --> 00:45:07.260
<v Speaker 2>the new book,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that children often move away from their</v>

993
00:45:07.261 --> 00:45:08.071
<v Speaker 2>parents.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

994
00:45:08.071 --> 00:45:10.470
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so talking about the background does not</v>

995
00:45:10.471 --> 00:45:15.270
<v Speaker 2>mean that that science and religion are </v>
<v Speaker 2>compatible because they're not there.</v>

996
00:45:15.310 --> 00:45:16.143
<v Speaker 2>They're not compatible in the sense of </v>
<v Speaker 2>being compatible with the specific </v>

997
00:45:19.291 --> 00:45:20.124
<v Speaker 2>doctrines of the world's great religions</v>
<v Speaker 2>sciences and incompatible with a vague </v>

998
00:45:23.011 --> 00:45:24.870
<v Speaker 2>notion that there might be purposed to </v>
<v Speaker 2>the university.</v>

999
00:45:24.970 --> 00:45:28.800
<v Speaker 2>There is no evidence of it whatsoever,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and there's no need for a god.</v>

1000
00:45:28.801 --> 00:45:29.634
<v Speaker 2>As I showed in my last book,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's no need for even supernatural </v>

1001
00:45:31.741 --> 00:45:35.870
<v Speaker 2>stuff to create a whole universe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but science can't disprove the notion of</v>

1002
00:45:35.910 --> 00:45:37.680
<v Speaker 2>some vague datey.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

1003
00:45:37.830 --> 00:45:38.663
<v Speaker 2>but what I can say is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know the earth didn't stop when </v>

1004
00:45:40.231 --> 00:45:41.064
<v Speaker 2>someone blew a trumpet and there wasn't </v>
<v Speaker 2>a virgin birth and all of those things </v>

1005
00:45:43.860 --> 00:45:46.050
<v Speaker 2>that's incompatible with what we know </v>
<v Speaker 2>about the universe.</v>

1006
00:45:46.210 --> 00:45:47.043
<v Speaker 2>All right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>We have two minutes left is one thing </v>

1007
00:45:50.010 --> 00:45:55.010
<v Speaker 2>that people aren't thinking about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that you were a theoretical physicist.</v>

1008
00:45:56.730 --> 00:46:01.050
<v Speaker 2>You're thinking of something on a day to</v>
<v Speaker 2>day basis that the average person is not</v>

1009
00:46:01.051 --> 00:46:03.180
<v Speaker 2>thinking about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Give me something that we.</v>

1010
00:46:03.181 --> 00:46:05.640
<v Speaker 2>Shots of things that we should be </v>
<v Speaker 2>thinking about that we're not.</v>

1011
00:46:05.850 --> 00:46:06.870
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know whether we should,</v>

1012
00:46:06.871 --> 00:46:11.871
<v Speaker 2>but something something fun is that the </v>
<v Speaker 2>m is the future of the universe.</v>

1013
00:46:13.980 --> 00:46:16.650
<v Speaker 2>Is is different than we might believe it</v>
<v Speaker 2>might be.</v>

1014
00:46:16.950 --> 00:46:17.783
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we may be living at a very special time </v>

1015
00:46:19.981 --> 00:46:21.270
<v Speaker 2>in the history of the universe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

1016
00:46:21.690 --> 00:46:22.290
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1017
00:46:22.290 --> 00:46:23.123
<v Speaker 2>when it turns out that what we've just </v>
<v Speaker 2>discovered about the Higgs Boson tells </v>

1018
00:46:27.091 --> 00:46:30.450
<v Speaker 2>us that everything we see in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>universe may be unstable,</v>

1019
00:46:30.451 --> 00:46:33.930
<v Speaker 2>that that matter as we know it could not</v>
<v Speaker 2>immediately.</v>

1020
00:46:33.931 --> 00:46:36.150
<v Speaker 2>So don't go ahead and sell your stocks </v>
<v Speaker 2>or anything,</v>

1021
00:46:36.450 --> 00:46:37.283
<v Speaker 2>but that in the far future that not only</v>
<v Speaker 2>we know the rest of the universe will </v>

1022
00:46:40.831 --> 00:46:41.664
<v Speaker 2>disappear because it's already expanding</v>
<v Speaker 2>away from us faster than the speed of </v>

1023
00:46:43.891 --> 00:46:44.724
<v Speaker 2>light.</v>
<v Speaker 2>At least it's receding from us faster </v>

1024
00:46:46.171 --> 00:46:47.680
<v Speaker 2>than the speed of light.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the and,</v>

1025
00:46:47.740 --> 00:46:48.573
<v Speaker 2>and so the longer we wait,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the less we'll we'll be able to see if </v>

1026
00:46:50.911 --> 00:46:51.744
<v Speaker 2>the universe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it turns out that like an icicle on </v>

1027
00:46:54.391 --> 00:46:55.224
<v Speaker 2>a window or on ice crystal on a window </v>
<v Speaker 2>and a summer morning will eventually </v>

1028
00:46:58.201 --> 00:46:59.034
<v Speaker 2>melt.</v>

1029
00:46:59.760 --> 00:47:00.593
<v Speaker 2>The Higgs field that is allowing </v>
<v Speaker 2>everything we now see to exist could </v>

1030
00:47:04.561 --> 00:47:06.570
<v Speaker 2>eventually melt in a different kind of </v>
<v Speaker 2>way.</v>

1031
00:47:06.660 --> 00:47:07.493
<v Speaker 2>And if it does,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then matter as we know it will </v>

1032
00:47:08.431 --> 00:47:09.264
<v Speaker 2>disappear.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we should enjoy our brief moment in </v>

1033
00:47:11.521 --> 00:47:13.890
<v Speaker 2>the sun so it's not going to happen </v>
<v Speaker 2>tomorrow.</v>

1034
