1
00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:10.060
<v Speaker 1>Joining me today is the libertarian </v>
<v Speaker 1>candidate for governor from the great </v>

2
00:00:10.060 --> 00:00:11.270
<v Speaker 1>state of New York,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Larry Sharpe.</v>

3
00:00:11.271 --> 00:00:13.130
<v Speaker 1>Welcome to the Rubin report.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thanks for having me.</v>

4
00:00:13.550 --> 00:00:16.160
<v Speaker 1>Libertarian,</v>
<v Speaker 1>New York.</v>

5
00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:17.720
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Are you okay,</v>

6
00:00:17.721 --> 00:00:22.721
<v Speaker 1>sir?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The issue to remember here is Keto </v>

7
00:00:22.721 --> 00:00:23.360
<v Speaker 1>actually rated us 50th when it came to </v>
<v Speaker 1>freedom.</v>

8
00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:25.530
<v Speaker 1>We beat California,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so he got you.</v>

9
00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:29.900
<v Speaker 1>When you came,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you came here to California to see me.</v>

10
00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:34.960
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because we're better than you when it </v>

11
00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:34.960
<v Speaker 1>comes to tyranny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We got you that.</v>

12
00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:34.960
<v Speaker 1>We got you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't be this.</v>

13
00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:36.410
<v Speaker 1>So yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is a critical piece.</v>

14
00:00:36.411 --> 00:00:41.411
<v Speaker 1>I'm glad I'm doing this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the right answer because imagine </v>

15
00:00:41.411 --> 00:00:42.470
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I make any impact in New York,</v>

16
00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:47.390
<v Speaker 1>what does that say with country?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It shows that the impact of this race is</v>

17
00:00:47.391 --> 00:00:50.210
<v Speaker 1>so important that if I can make anything</v>
<v Speaker 1>happen in New York state,</v>

18
00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:52.070
<v Speaker 1>it will affect the rest of the nation </v>
<v Speaker 1>over night.</v>

19
00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:54.680
<v Speaker 1>I want you to imagine for a second in my</v>
<v Speaker 1>race,</v>

20
00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:59.300
<v Speaker 1>I just get 10 percent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That will change how people think in New</v>

21
00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:00.890
<v Speaker 1>York through throughout the entire </v>
<v Speaker 1>state.</v>

22
00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:04.010
<v Speaker 1>It'll force republicans that actually </v>
<v Speaker 1>have to be Republicans,</v>

23
00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:05.600
<v Speaker 1>Democrats,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Democrats,</v>

24
00:01:05.601 --> 00:01:08.840
<v Speaker 1>because now the party will have an </v>
<v Speaker 1>actual voice.</v>

25
00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:10.790
<v Speaker 1>So now when I go to Republicans and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>

26
00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:12.590
<v Speaker 1>you're supposed to be about small </v>
<v Speaker 1>government,</v>

27
00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:15.320
<v Speaker 1>someone will listen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When I go to Democrats and say,</v>

28
00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:17.090
<v Speaker 1>you're supposed to be about civil </v>
<v Speaker 1>liberties.</v>

29
00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:20.090
<v Speaker 1>Someone will listen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It will force them to be better,</v>

30
00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:25.450
<v Speaker 1>but I'm going to go one step further.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What if I actually beat the Republican </v>

31
00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:26.720
<v Speaker 1>in New York State?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's magical.</v>

32
00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:30.550
<v Speaker 1>I beat the Republican New York state </v>
<v Speaker 1>politics works for the first two.</v>

33
00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:35.730
<v Speaker 1>Two parties actually run everything so </v>
<v Speaker 1>republicans would officially be knocked </v>

34
00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:40.541
<v Speaker 1>out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So of course that we write the rules </v>

35
00:01:40.541 --> 00:01:40.541
<v Speaker 1>overnight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of course they were the rules.</v>

36
00:01:40.541 --> 00:01:40.541
<v Speaker 1>Of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I know that.</v>

37
00:01:40.541 --> 00:01:42.650
<v Speaker 1>Are you implying that New York state has</v>
<v Speaker 1>a corrupt assembling?</v>

38
00:01:42.651 --> 00:01:43.610
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>come on,</v>

39
00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:46.020
<v Speaker 1>come on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have office.</v>

40
00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:47.300
<v Speaker 1>Emily.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's be clear.</v>

41
00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:50.570
<v Speaker 1>Grew Assembly or insulting me now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Most corrupt.</v>

42
00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:54.200
<v Speaker 1>So now my point being,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it would then allow for third parties to</v>

43
00:01:54.201 --> 00:01:57.290
<v Speaker 1>really exist in New York state and that </v>
<v Speaker 1>again would cross the nation.</v>

44
00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:01.400
<v Speaker 1>But imagine if actually one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I actually went and I turned New York</v>

45
00:02:01.401 --> 00:02:06.401
<v Speaker 1>state gold,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that would change the entire nation </v>

46
00:02:06.401 --> 00:02:06.401
<v Speaker 1>overnight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Overnight.</v>

47
00:02:06.401 --> 00:02:09.110
<v Speaker 1>All the liberty leaning Republicans,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Democrats would come out of the woodwork</v>

48
00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:14.260
<v Speaker 1>and be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we always love Larry Sharp and they </v>

49
00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:16.061
<v Speaker 1>would all jump on board and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the Libertarian party will become </v>

50
00:02:16.061 --> 00:02:19.330
<v Speaker 1>huge overnight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This race has the most impact because </v>

51
00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:19.670
<v Speaker 1>it's New York.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

52
00:02:19.671 --> 00:02:22.940
<v Speaker 1>So you are acknowledging this is an </v>
<v Speaker 1>uphill battle.</v>

53
00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:24.680
<v Speaker 1>It's coming.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

54
00:02:24.681 --> 00:02:26.630
<v Speaker 1>And I got to tell you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if it was six months ago,</v>

55
00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:30.170
<v Speaker 1>I knew I could make impact that 10 </v>
<v Speaker 1>percent I knew I could get.</v>

56
00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:33.770
<v Speaker 1>I knew that six months ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is the libertarian usually get in a</v>

57
00:02:33.771 --> 00:02:35.830
<v Speaker 1>gubernatorial race?</v>
<v Speaker 1>One percent maybe I met.</v>

58
00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:37.820
<v Speaker 1>That's a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We rarely break 50,000</v>

59
00:02:37.821 --> 00:02:38.690
<v Speaker 1>bucks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If I go through,</v>

60
00:02:38.691 --> 00:02:40.550
<v Speaker 1>we've ever bring him 2000 bucks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do you make of that?</v>

61
00:02:40.551 --> 00:02:42.230
<v Speaker 1>Before we go specifically to your </v>
<v Speaker 1>candidacy?</v>

62
00:02:42.231 --> 00:02:44.120
<v Speaker 1>Because one of my issues with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Libertarians,</v>

63
00:02:44.121 --> 00:02:47.900
<v Speaker 1>it's like as a party,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's such disorganization.</v>

64
00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:48.790
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

65
00:02:48.791 --> 00:02:53.791
<v Speaker 1>I want to talk a little bit about Gary </v>
<v Speaker 1>Johnson because I know you worked for </v>

66
00:02:53.791 --> 00:02:53.890
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we're almost his VP choice,</v>

67
00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:59.190
<v Speaker 1>a couple of people tried to beat him up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm a big fan we can get into to </v>

68
00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:00.820
<v Speaker 1>some of that stuff and I've had on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>show and I think he's a good person.</v>

69
00:03:00.821 --> 00:03:05.821
<v Speaker 1>I think he was a flawed candidate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but just that the party itself seems to </v>

70
00:03:05.821 --> 00:03:10.381
<v Speaker 1>be extremely disorganized and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when they have these conventions and </v>

71
00:03:10.381 --> 00:03:13.380
<v Speaker 1>it's like naked people and all this </v>
<v Speaker 1>naked guys,</v>

72
00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:15.420
<v Speaker 1>naked guy and.</v>

73
00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:18.390
<v Speaker 1>But that have been met naked guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure he's a great,</v>

74
00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:19.780
<v Speaker 1>he's a great guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's a nice guy,</v>

75
00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:22.900
<v Speaker 1>but that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that as a party,</v>

76
00:03:22.901 --> 00:03:27.901
<v Speaker 1>there's been a lot of disorganization </v>
<v Speaker 1>here and I guess that when you were </v>

77
00:03:27.901 --> 00:03:29.200
<v Speaker 1>making things about the individual,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's hard to get people to come together</v>

78
00:03:29.201 --> 00:03:31.180
<v Speaker 1>on a collective,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what can you do?</v>

79
00:03:31.181 --> 00:03:33.340
<v Speaker 1>What do you think?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a fair diagnosis?</v>

80
00:03:33.341 --> 00:03:34.840
<v Speaker 1>Number one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what I just laid out,</v>

81
00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:36.910
<v Speaker 1>it's tough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The system is set up against us,</v>

82
00:03:36.911 --> 00:03:41.911
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's up against us to fail any third </v>

83
00:03:41.911 --> 00:03:41.911
<v Speaker 1>party.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

84
00:03:41.911 --> 00:03:41.911
<v Speaker 1>You.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you find any other third parties that</v>

85
00:03:41.911 --> 00:03:41.980
<v Speaker 1>are great?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

86
00:03:41.981 --> 00:03:45.520
<v Speaker 1>but I least liked the idea of not on </v>
<v Speaker 1>board of the green stuff,</v>

87
00:03:45.521 --> 00:03:50.521
<v Speaker 1>so I want them to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean a lot of the third parties </v>

88
00:03:50.521 --> 00:03:50.521
<v Speaker 1>collapse because the system is against </v>
<v Speaker 1>them,</v>

89
00:03:50.521 --> 00:03:52.750
<v Speaker 1>but I say the same thing always the </v>
<v Speaker 1>panacea,</v>

90
00:03:52.751 --> 00:03:55.510
<v Speaker 1>the cure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all his victory when we begin to.</v>

91
00:03:55.510 --> 00:03:57.130
<v Speaker 1>When people come up on our,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on our,</v>

92
00:03:57.250 --> 00:04:02.250
<v Speaker 1>on our team,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of the people who believe in us </v>

93
00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:03.340
<v Speaker 1>don't join our party because of that </v>
<v Speaker 1>chicken and egg.</v>

94
00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:04.060
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

95
00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:08.620
<v Speaker 1>The party isn't awesome because awesome </v>
<v Speaker 1>people aren't flooding to it because the</v>

96
00:04:08.621 --> 00:04:13.621
<v Speaker 1>party is an awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Therefore all some people are flooding </v>

97
00:04:13.621 --> 00:04:13.621
<v Speaker 1>to it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

98
00:04:13.621 --> 00:04:16.690
<v Speaker 1>It's a chicken and egg,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so once we become a real party where </v>

99
00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:16.690
<v Speaker 1>people actually are saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>

100
00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:21.450
<v Speaker 1>these guys can win.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when reasons why I'm reading this </v>

101
00:04:21.450 --> 00:04:21.450
<v Speaker 1>libertarian,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>

102
00:04:21.450 --> 00:04:21.640
<v Speaker 1>I'm not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not jumping ship and joining another</v>

103
00:04:21.641 --> 00:04:24.300
<v Speaker 1>party and trying to go on some other </v>
<v Speaker 1>part of him running as a libertarian.</v>

104
00:04:24.301 --> 00:04:29.301
<v Speaker 1>I'm doing it on purpose.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to show people a third party can </v>

105
00:04:29.301 --> 00:04:32.470
<v Speaker 1>have impact and can win and joined the </v>
<v Speaker 1>third parties my candidacy is assuming I</v>

106
00:04:32.471 --> 00:04:34.990
<v Speaker 1>do very well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't just a couple of Italians.</v>

107
00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:38.560
<v Speaker 1>It helps any third party,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but obviously heavily my part.</v>

108
00:04:38.561 --> 00:04:40.930
<v Speaker 1>It's what I care about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it will help others also.</v>

109
00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:42.760
<v Speaker 1>So you're right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a problem.</v>

110
00:04:42.761 --> 00:04:44.950
<v Speaker 1>Of course it is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but all the parties are a problem.</v>

111
00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:47.680
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Republicans and Democrats have Kooks</v>

112
00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:48.850
<v Speaker 1>also,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

113
00:04:48.851 --> 00:04:50.470
<v Speaker 1>They have crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no doubt about it.</v>

114
00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:54.280
<v Speaker 1>It's just there's so few of us that I </v>
<v Speaker 1>will stand up and want to scrutiny.</v>

115
00:04:54.670 --> 00:04:58.270
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to things that the things that</v>
<v Speaker 1>politicians who are Democrats,</v>

116
00:04:58.271 --> 00:05:01.510
<v Speaker 1>Republicans have said on far worse than </v>
<v Speaker 1>Libertarians have set,</v>

117
00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:04.210
<v Speaker 1>but it's whatever that the main that the</v>
<v Speaker 1>two old parties.</v>

118
00:05:04.211 --> 00:05:05.890
<v Speaker 1>So they get a pass.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not mad at it.</v>

119
00:05:05.891 --> 00:05:07.840
<v Speaker 1>It's the way it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a burden that we have,</v>

120
00:05:08.170 --> 00:05:11.020
<v Speaker 1>that I've accepted and I've taken on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the burden I take on.</v>

121
00:05:11.021 --> 00:05:14.080
<v Speaker 1>But here's the glory.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If I win this battle,</v>

122
00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:18.880
<v Speaker 1>my victory sweeter because I had all the</v>
<v Speaker 1>burdens I'm find with it is what it is.</v>

123
00:05:19.030 --> 00:05:19.650
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Alright.</v>

124
00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:24.720
<v Speaker 1>So before we get into the specifics of </v>
<v Speaker 1>New York and what you are libertarian </v>

125
00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:28.741
<v Speaker 1>principles are and things like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>tell me a little bit about your history </v>

126
00:05:28.741 --> 00:05:31.651
<v Speaker 1>because you are actually born and bred </v>
<v Speaker 1>in New York and you've got an </v>

127
00:05:31.651 --> 00:05:32.650
<v Speaker 1>interesting history and were in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>marines and all sorts of stuff.</v>

128
00:05:32.651 --> 00:05:34.710
<v Speaker 1>So it was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So God gives me back.</v>

129
00:05:34.750 --> 00:05:37.000
<v Speaker 1>I'll give you the short version.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm born in Manhattan.</v>

130
00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:42.360
<v Speaker 1>I'm biracial parents in the sixties.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My mom gives me up for adoption because </v>

131
00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:44.350
<v Speaker 1>she can't handle the issues of racial </v>
<v Speaker 1>issues in her family.</v>

132
00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:49.620
<v Speaker 1>I'm very lucky to adopted very young.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think I was six weeks old by a lovely </v>

133
00:05:49.620 --> 00:05:53.641
<v Speaker 1>couple who took me to the Bronx,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a German immigrant and I'm her husband </v>

134
00:05:53.641 --> 00:05:55.540
<v Speaker 1>who was in the army in Germany.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's how we met her.</v>

135
00:05:56.020 --> 00:05:59.740
<v Speaker 1>So I raised in the bronx for them around</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

136
00:06:00.020 --> 00:06:01.460
<v Speaker 1>nine or 10 in that area.</v>

137
00:06:01.460 --> 00:06:03.980
<v Speaker 1>11.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And at that point my mother had actually</v>

138
00:06:03.981 --> 00:06:07.850
<v Speaker 1>divorced and met another man who was my </v>
<v Speaker 1>actual father who actually raised me and</v>

139
00:06:07.851 --> 00:06:09.980
<v Speaker 1>taught me to be a man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We moved to Long Island.</v>

140
00:06:10.220 --> 00:06:12.970
<v Speaker 1>He died when I was around 12 years old.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When he passed.</v>

141
00:06:12.971 --> 00:06:15.320
<v Speaker 1>It's just me and my mom.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My mom couldn't handle it.</v>

142
00:06:15.380 --> 00:06:18.980
<v Speaker 1>She was really devastated by this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Her family wasn't Germany.</v>

143
00:06:19.250 --> 00:06:21.230
<v Speaker 1>She was here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was distant.</v>

144
00:06:21.231 --> 00:06:23.270
<v Speaker 1>I was a young teenage boy trying to find</v>
<v Speaker 1>my way.</v>

145
00:06:23.271 --> 00:06:24.770
<v Speaker 1>Also,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I was 17,</v>

146
00:06:24.771 --> 00:06:27.350
<v Speaker 1>I left and joined the Marine Corps.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Marine Corps was there for about six</v>

147
00:06:27.351 --> 00:06:28.250
<v Speaker 1>years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>seven years.</v>

148
00:06:28.820 --> 00:06:30.620
<v Speaker 1>When I got out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my mother had already collapsed.</v>

149
00:06:30.890 --> 00:06:34.880
<v Speaker 1>She was initially they can to illegal </v>
<v Speaker 1>drugs and eventually illegal drugs.</v>

150
00:06:34.881 --> 00:06:38.480
<v Speaker 1>She was arrested because the drug war,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she went to prison and Creighton Felon.</v>

151
00:06:38.870 --> 00:06:41.090
<v Speaker 1>I got her out and try to put it back on </v>
<v Speaker 1>her feet.</v>

152
00:06:41.660 --> 00:06:46.660
<v Speaker 1>I tried to help her too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She left the prison with two garbage </v>

153
00:06:46.660 --> 00:06:47.240
<v Speaker 1>bags.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was what her life was,</v>

154
00:06:47.480 --> 00:06:49.880
<v Speaker 1>so I helped her get back on her feet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>try to get a job.</v>

155
00:06:50.060 --> 00:06:51.830
<v Speaker 1>I saw how hard it was for to get a job.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

156
00:06:51.831 --> 00:06:54.770
<v Speaker 1>she was always lying on every form </v>
<v Speaker 1>because of the new.</v>

157
00:06:54.771 --> 00:06:59.771
<v Speaker 1>She was a felony.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They wouldn't hire her and when she was </v>

158
00:06:59.771 --> 00:06:59.771
<v Speaker 1>working she had to always lie and she </v>
<v Speaker 1>was a hostage.</v>

159
00:06:59.771 --> 00:07:04.481
<v Speaker 1>Basically I became an entrepreneur </v>
<v Speaker 1>because I didn't want my mom to be a </v>

160
00:07:04.481 --> 00:07:04.940
<v Speaker 1>hostage,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so we started our own business.</v>

161
00:07:05.060 --> 00:07:06.950
<v Speaker 1>Me and her and my Stepdad,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who was another man cheat,</v>

162
00:07:06.970 --> 00:07:10.070
<v Speaker 1>she had married afterwards and so we </v>
<v Speaker 1>stopped,</v>

163
00:07:10.110 --> 00:07:15.110
<v Speaker 1>started businesses together so that she </v>
<v Speaker 1>could be her own person and not be a </v>

164
00:07:15.110 --> 00:07:15.110
<v Speaker 1>hostage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was our first business.</v>

165
00:07:15.110 --> 00:07:16.400
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>after that got up and running,</v>

166
00:07:16.401 --> 00:07:21.401
<v Speaker 1>I left that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>had a bunch of sales jobs and then </v>

167
00:07:21.401 --> 00:07:23.621
<v Speaker 1>decided to Uhm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then decided to start my own business </v>

168
00:07:23.621 --> 00:07:23.621
<v Speaker 1>again.</v>

169
00:07:23.621 --> 00:07:24.080
<v Speaker 1>That business did not go well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I sold that one off,</v>

170
00:07:24.580 --> 00:07:25.880
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that I went and got this business,</v>

171
00:07:25.881 --> 00:07:27.920
<v Speaker 1>which I've had for 14 years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a consultant,</v>

172
00:07:28.040 --> 00:07:30.260
<v Speaker 1>a trainer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've been an officer in a public company</v>

173
00:07:30.261 --> 00:07:31.940
<v Speaker 1>twice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've taught in colleges.</v>

174
00:07:31.941 --> 00:07:34.070
<v Speaker 1>I teach now at Baruch,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sometimes John Jay.</v>

175
00:07:34.071 --> 00:07:35.710
<v Speaker 1>I've taught at the graduate level of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

176
00:07:35.840 --> 00:07:37.230
<v Speaker 1>as a guest instructor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

177
00:07:37.350 --> 00:07:39.740
<v Speaker 1>and Yale and Columbia.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I've taught a lot.</v>

178
00:07:39.741 --> 00:07:41.510
<v Speaker 1>I do a lot of negative coaching,</v>
<v Speaker 1>training,</v>

179
00:07:41.570 --> 00:07:43.130
<v Speaker 1>leadership,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sales,</v>

180
00:07:43.131 --> 00:07:45.120
<v Speaker 1>that kind of stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I'm an entrepreneur,</v>

181
00:07:45.121 --> 00:07:50.121
<v Speaker 1>but doing it for 14 years and two years </v>
<v Speaker 1>ago I saw an opportunity to jump on </v>

<v Speaker 1>a VP nominees.</v>

183
00:07:53.201 --> 00:07:55.610

<v Speaker 1>I lost the bill.</v>

184
00:07:55.611 --> 00:07:56.960
<v Speaker 1>Well by 30,</v>
<v Speaker 1>31 votes.</v>

185
00:07:56.961 --> 00:07:58.680
<v Speaker 1>Not that anyone's counting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um.</v>

186
00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:04.000
<v Speaker 1>And now I'm running for governor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was two years ago or that was in </v>

187
00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:04.000
<v Speaker 1>2012?</v>

188
00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:07.630
<v Speaker 1>Twenty 16.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was 2016 was when I first came to </v>

189
00:08:07.630 --> 00:08:07.630
<v Speaker 1>the party.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

190
00:08:07.630 --> 00:08:10.580
<v Speaker 1>I was not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was not really political at all when I</v>

191
00:08:10.581 --> 00:08:12.290
<v Speaker 1>was a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I was a youngster.</v>

192
00:08:12.320 --> 00:08:13.380
<v Speaker 1>Do you wanna hear the story?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

193
00:08:13.740 --> 00:08:15.820
<v Speaker 1>When I'm interviewing you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I write a lot with.</v>

194
00:08:15.840 --> 00:08:20.840
<v Speaker 1>I think we're doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm happy to the APP away for seven </v>

195
00:08:20.840 --> 00:08:20.840
<v Speaker 1>hours the first time anyone's ever said </v>
<v Speaker 1>that to me.</v>

196
00:08:20.841 --> 00:08:23.270
<v Speaker 1>I love to hear this story to your </v>
<v Speaker 1>audience.</v>

197
00:08:23.271 --> 00:08:24.660
<v Speaker 1>Wants to hear my cold stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yap away.</v>

199
00:08:25.521 --> 00:08:26.410
<v Speaker 1>And they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

200
00:08:26.450 --> 00:08:28.910
<v Speaker 1>clicking off and we're going to watch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to have a drink instead.</v>

201
00:08:28.911 --> 00:08:30.500
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if that would make it better,</v>

202
00:08:30.501 --> 00:08:31.900
<v Speaker 1>maybe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Alright.</v>

203
00:08:31.910 --> 00:08:33.740
<v Speaker 1>Let's see what happens with the story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

204
00:08:33.870 --> 00:08:35.660
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as a youngster,</v>

205
00:08:35.661 --> 00:08:39.140
<v Speaker 1>I grew up in New York City and of course</v>
<v Speaker 1>Democrats or Republicans are evil.</v>

206
00:08:39.260 --> 00:08:40.040
<v Speaker 1>How it works,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

207
00:08:40.070 --> 00:08:41.570
<v Speaker 1>You're evil because you have an art by </v>
<v Speaker 1>your name.</v>

208
00:08:41.571 --> 00:08:42.740
<v Speaker 1>You're good because you with you by your</v>
<v Speaker 1>name.</v>

209
00:08:43.370 --> 00:08:48.370
<v Speaker 1>Who was the mayor at the time?</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is where I think it was Ed Koch </v>

210
00:08:48.370 --> 00:08:50.360
<v Speaker 1>cocktail because I loved the head coach.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I grew up in long island,</v>

211
00:08:50.361 --> 00:08:53.120
<v Speaker 1>but we were big but um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it wasn't about him.</v>

212
00:08:53.121 --> 00:08:55.980
<v Speaker 1>It was about the party.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My Mom and dad strict Democrats.</v>

213
00:08:55.981 --> 00:09:00.981
<v Speaker 1>That's who you are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You voted Democrat because they look </v>

214
00:09:00.981 --> 00:09:03.401
<v Speaker 1>good and Pumpkins were evil.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But when I joined the marine corps at </v>

215
00:09:03.401 --> 00:09:05.871
<v Speaker 1>17,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at the Marine Corps is a very </v>

216
00:09:05.871 --> 00:09:07.401
<v Speaker 1>conservative branch when it comes to the</v>
<v Speaker 1>branches and most of my friends and </v>

217
00:09:07.401 --> 00:09:07.880
<v Speaker 1>people I know in leaders that are </v>
<v Speaker 1>respected,</v>

218
00:09:07.881 --> 00:09:09.330
<v Speaker 1>they were mostly conservative </v>
<v Speaker 1>Republicans.</v>

219
00:09:09.840 --> 00:09:14.840
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ronald Reagan was my first commander in </v>

220
00:09:14.840 --> 00:09:14.840
<v Speaker 1>chief.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I think I kind of became a republican</v>

221
00:09:14.840 --> 00:09:15.090
<v Speaker 1>as a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as a team.</v>

222
00:09:15.120 --> 00:09:17.590
<v Speaker 1>And as a young 20 something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I became more of a Republican.</v>

223
00:09:17.591 --> 00:09:22.591
<v Speaker 1>So I kind of shifted back,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was never part of a party and they </v>

224
00:09:22.591 --> 00:09:23.400
<v Speaker 1>only voted in the presidential elections</v>
<v Speaker 1>because it was absentee.</v>

225
00:09:23.401 --> 00:09:25.860
<v Speaker 1>I wasn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was always overseas so I wouldn't be a</v>

226
00:09:25.861 --> 00:09:30.861
<v Speaker 1>male,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I didn't even register locally to do </v>

227
00:09:30.861 --> 00:09:33.591
<v Speaker 1>the local elections.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So can we pause there for one sec </v>

228
00:09:33.591 --> 00:09:36.580
<v Speaker 1>because you mentioned you're biracial </v>
<v Speaker 1>and I hate making anything about race </v>

229
00:09:36.580 --> 00:09:40.290
<v Speaker 1>because we're so overly racialized now </v>
<v Speaker 1>and identity politics and all this,</v>

230
00:09:40.560 --> 00:09:42.600
<v Speaker 1>but I think that a certain amount of my </v>
<v Speaker 1>own is when they hear you say that.</v>

231
00:09:42.601 --> 00:09:43.350
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you were,</v>

232
00:09:43.560 --> 00:09:44.880
<v Speaker 1>you were,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

233
00:09:45.120 --> 00:09:50.120
<v Speaker 1>Ronald Reagan was your commander in </v>
<v Speaker 1>chief and you were identifying as a </v>

234
00:09:50.120 --> 00:09:52.170
<v Speaker 1>Republican back then as a black man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>

235
00:09:52.260 --> 00:09:53.190
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

236
00:09:53.250 --> 00:09:54.930
<v Speaker 1>I've had many black conservatives not </v>
<v Speaker 1>here,</v>

237
00:09:54.931 --> 00:09:59.931
<v Speaker 1>some of whom I considered great friends,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like Larry Elder and I bet this was the </v>

238
00:09:59.931 --> 00:09:59.931
<v Speaker 1>eighties,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thomas Soul on and many or no.</v>

239
00:09:59.931 --> 00:10:01.230
<v Speaker 1>So that's why I wanted to ask you about </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

240
00:10:01.430 --> 00:10:06.430
<v Speaker 1>What,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what was it like then to take that </v>

241
00:10:06.430 --> 00:10:07.110
<v Speaker 1>political,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very political,</v>

242
00:10:07.200 --> 00:10:12.200
<v Speaker 1>if that made any sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I wasn't talking about things I </v>

243
00:10:12.200 --> 00:10:12.200
<v Speaker 1>did,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but even internally for you,</v>

244
00:10:12.200 --> 00:10:16.680
<v Speaker 1>I didn't care to before too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't care if you don't care now.</v>

245
00:10:16.920 --> 00:10:19.380
<v Speaker 1>I didn't care that I don't care.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now I am who I am.</v>

246
00:10:19.381 --> 00:10:21.030
<v Speaker 1>I believe what I believe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you like it or you don't.</v>

247
00:10:21.270 --> 00:10:22.770
<v Speaker 1>And that's how it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't care that either.</v>

248
00:10:22.800 --> 00:10:27.800
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I didn't really care to be fun with </v>

249
00:10:27.800 --> 00:10:27.800
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some people thought I was crazy.</v>

250
00:10:27.800 --> 00:10:27.800
<v Speaker 1>My parents were,</v>
<v Speaker 1>have been insane,</v>

251
00:10:28.400 --> 00:10:29.250
<v Speaker 1>but whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't care.</v>

252
00:10:29.251 --> 00:10:30.900
<v Speaker 1>I didn't talk about it much.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't.</v>

253
00:10:31.170 --> 00:10:32.280
<v Speaker 1>I was worried about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

254
00:10:32.281 --> 00:10:36.300
<v Speaker 1>chasing girls at 19,</v>
<v Speaker 1>20 years old was being a marine.</v>

255
00:10:36.301 --> 00:10:37.830
<v Speaker 1>I was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wasn't worried about it.</v>

256
00:10:37.860 --> 00:10:39.330
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't part of my life to be before </v>
<v Speaker 1>with you.</v>

257
00:10:39.400 --> 00:10:43.410
<v Speaker 1>I look back now and I wish it was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wish I had known more stuff then,</v>

258
00:10:43.980 --> 00:10:45.870
<v Speaker 1>but I was a young guy trying to figure </v>
<v Speaker 1>out to be a man.</v>

259
00:10:46.020 --> 00:10:47.610
<v Speaker 1>I wasn't really thinking about that very</v>
<v Speaker 1>much.</v>

260
00:10:48.060 --> 00:10:51.360
<v Speaker 1>So that's why eventually the nineties I </v>
<v Speaker 1>went to,</v>

261
00:10:51.600 --> 00:10:55.720
<v Speaker 1>I went to Perot because I just didn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>want the ares of the DS.</v>

262
00:10:55.920 --> 00:10:59.220
<v Speaker 1>Then I went to Nader 2000 because I </v>
<v Speaker 1>didn't want the RS and the DS.</v>

263
00:10:59.280 --> 00:11:02.400
<v Speaker 1>I knew that the RS and the Ds were the </v>
<v Speaker 1>same.</v>

264
00:11:02.401 --> 00:11:07.401
<v Speaker 1>There was no difference.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I knew they were all putting my friends </v>

265
00:11:07.401 --> 00:11:07.401
<v Speaker 1>in jail.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I knew they will.</v>

266
00:11:07.401 --> 00:11:08.640
<v Speaker 1>All the one drugs and the war on terror </v>
<v Speaker 1>wasn't going to stop that.</v>

267
00:11:08.680 --> 00:11:10.110
<v Speaker 1>That's going to be bad no matter what I </v>
<v Speaker 1>did.</v>

268
00:11:10.410 --> 00:11:12.900
<v Speaker 1>Excuse me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I just.</v>

269
00:11:12.901 --> 00:11:14.880
<v Speaker 1>And again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you would've asked me what was Perot,</v>

270
00:11:14.881 --> 00:11:17.160
<v Speaker 1>what was it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What was a nadir?</v>

271
00:11:17.160 --> 00:11:19.350
<v Speaker 1>His policies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't have told you.</v>

272
00:11:20.220 --> 00:11:25.220
<v Speaker 1>I just knew they weren't the mainstream </v>
<v Speaker 1>and therefore they have a good enough </v>

273
00:11:25.220 --> 00:11:25.220
<v Speaker 1>for me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And again,</v>

274
00:11:25.220 --> 00:11:25.650
<v Speaker 1>people thought I was crazy and I didn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>care.</v>

275
00:11:26.340 --> 00:11:28.230
<v Speaker 1>So finally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in 2008,</v>

276
00:11:28.231 --> 00:11:29.490
<v Speaker 1>I was considering not voting at all </v>
<v Speaker 1>anymore.</v>

277
00:11:29.491 --> 00:11:30.420
<v Speaker 1>I was really finished.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

278
00:11:30.421 --> 00:11:32.700
<v Speaker 1>they'll do care.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't matter of running a business.</v>

279
00:11:32.880 --> 00:11:33.770
<v Speaker 1>I'm gonna,</v>
<v Speaker 1>run my business,</v>

280
00:11:33.790 --> 00:11:38.790
<v Speaker 1>make my money,</v>
<v Speaker 1>become a bazillionaire and who cares </v>

281
00:11:38.790 --> 00:11:39.000
<v Speaker 1>who's in charge because I'll run them </v>
<v Speaker 1>because I'll have all the money.</v>

282
00:11:39.060 --> 00:11:42.150
<v Speaker 1>That was my logic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't for so are the eight.</v>

283
00:11:42.240 --> 00:11:43.710
<v Speaker 1>When Obama came,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought,</v>

284
00:11:43.800 --> 00:11:44.700
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is different.</v>

285
00:11:45.830 --> 00:11:49.800
<v Speaker 1>He's the city Guy Black.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is the guy.</v>

286
00:11:49.830 --> 00:11:51.540
<v Speaker 1>He's different.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He speaks differently.</v>

287
00:11:51.660 --> 00:11:53.460
<v Speaker 1>People are excited.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>

288
00:11:53.470 --> 00:11:55.000
<v Speaker 1>You know what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe this is the guy and I,</v>

289
00:11:55.040 --> 00:11:57.610
<v Speaker 1>I had hope I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I bought the hope and change.</v>

290
00:11:57.820 --> 00:12:02.820
<v Speaker 1>I bought it and when I address it before</v>
<v Speaker 1>you added sort of a libertarian </v>

291
00:12:02.820 --> 00:12:02.820
<v Speaker 1>awakening,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

292
00:12:03.370 --> 00:12:04.430
<v Speaker 1>Actually I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

293
00:12:04.540 --> 00:12:06.400
<v Speaker 1>this is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was having libertarian awakening,</v>

294
00:12:06.790 --> 00:12:09.640
<v Speaker 1>but that sort of overrode it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I gotta tell you how I became that.</v>

295
00:12:10.120 --> 00:12:12.190
<v Speaker 1>I became a libertarian,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not through politics.</v>

296
00:12:12.730 --> 00:12:14.350
<v Speaker 1>I came to trying it through Robert </v>
<v Speaker 1>Ringer.</v>

297
00:12:15.260 --> 00:12:20.260
<v Speaker 1>Robert Ringer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think Robert Ringer is a </v>

298
00:12:20.260 --> 00:12:22.171
<v Speaker 1>business guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's a subjectivist and he wrote many </v>

299
00:12:22.171 --> 00:12:23.350
<v Speaker 1>books looking out for number one to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>

300
00:12:23.380 --> 00:12:25.570
<v Speaker 1>not to be intimidated,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nothing happens.</v>

301
00:12:25.630 --> 00:12:27.670
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>unless something moves action.</v>

302
00:12:27.910 --> 00:12:32.910
<v Speaker 1>He talks about how to brand yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He talks about how to be successful in </v>

303
00:12:32.910 --> 00:12:33.640
<v Speaker 1>business in life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was a trainer as well.</v>

304
00:12:33.641 --> 00:12:35.530
<v Speaker 1>I said there now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was one of my mentors.</v>

305
00:12:35.531 --> 00:12:37.330
<v Speaker 1>I don't know him personally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I've read his books.</v>

306
00:12:37.540 --> 00:12:39.820
<v Speaker 1>I was part of his website,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I knew who he was,</v>

307
00:12:39.821 --> 00:12:43.140
<v Speaker 1>so he.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He got me into reading and rent.</v>

308
00:12:43.790 --> 00:12:46.270
<v Speaker 1>I didn't come to libertarianism through </v>
<v Speaker 1>politics.</v>

309
00:12:46.271 --> 00:12:46.960
<v Speaker 1>I came into business.</v>

310
00:12:46.960 --> 00:12:51.960
<v Speaker 1>I'm a business guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I was reading atlas shrugged because </v>

311
00:12:51.960 --> 00:12:53.230
<v Speaker 1>he said we that the shrugged not because</v>
<v Speaker 1>some political I did.</v>

312
00:12:53.410 --> 00:12:55.270
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know who Ron Paul was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Doesn't eight.</v>

313
00:12:55.510 --> 00:12:57.430
<v Speaker 1>I had no idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wasn't political.</v>

314
00:12:57.431 --> 00:13:00.420
<v Speaker 1>I was a business guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The only reason why I care about Obama's</v>

315
00:13:00.430 --> 00:13:02.860
<v Speaker 1>because he was so different.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It got my attention.</v>

316
00:13:03.340 --> 00:13:05.760
<v Speaker 1>So again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't really understand his policies,</v>

317
00:13:05.761 --> 00:13:07.960
<v Speaker 1>if that made me sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just thought he's different.</v>

318
00:13:08.170 --> 00:13:10.870
<v Speaker 1>He's not them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It can't be worse.</v>

319
00:13:11.290 --> 00:13:16.290
<v Speaker 1>That was my thought process.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So as I'm moving towards objectivism in </v>

320
00:13:16.290 --> 00:13:19.951
<v Speaker 1>that regard,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not an objectivist and I'd never </v>

321
00:13:19.951 --> 00:13:22.051
<v Speaker 1>been one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but some of the market ideas made sense </v>

322
00:13:22.051 --> 00:13:25.441
<v Speaker 1>to me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The idea of Austrian economics made </v>

323
00:13:25.441 --> 00:13:27.271
<v Speaker 1>sense to me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know it was Austrian economics </v>

324
00:13:27.271 --> 00:13:30.410
<v Speaker 1>though,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because I'd never read freedom and I'd </v>

325
00:13:30.410 --> 00:13:30.410
<v Speaker 1>never read those.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know.</v>

326
00:13:30.410 --> 00:13:32.710
<v Speaker 1>I read Robert Ringer and he had told me </v>
<v Speaker 1>what his,</v>

327
00:13:32.890 --> 00:13:35.950
<v Speaker 1>his views,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I got things secondhand through him,</v>

328
00:13:36.610 --> 00:13:37.510
<v Speaker 1>so I was already teaching.</v>

329
00:13:37.510 --> 00:13:38.950
<v Speaker 1>I was teaching postindustrial </v>
<v Speaker 1>leadership.</v>

330
00:13:39.130 --> 00:13:44.130
<v Speaker 1>Obviously she'd buy in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was teaching sales is not about </v>

331
00:13:44.130 --> 00:13:44.380
<v Speaker 1>forcing someone to do something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>getting to do it.</v>

332
00:13:44.650 --> 00:13:49.650
<v Speaker 1>I was teaching volunteerism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not knowing what it was called or what </v>

333
00:13:49.650 --> 00:13:53.281
<v Speaker 1>it was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was already doing it in my own </v>

334
00:13:53.281 --> 00:13:53.281
<v Speaker 1>business.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So anyway,</v>

335
00:13:53.281 --> 00:13:56.881
<v Speaker 1>I was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was having that change so it doesn't </v>

336
00:13:56.881 --> 00:13:57.070
<v Speaker 1>fall and about 2010.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anyway,</v>

337
00:13:57.071 --> 00:14:02.071
<v Speaker 1>that was happening already.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it changed my business model and </v>

338
00:14:02.071 --> 00:14:02.071
<v Speaker 1>doing it already.</v>
<v Speaker 1>After crash it,</v>

339
00:14:02.071 --> 00:14:03.700
<v Speaker 1>I had to jump into it a lot because I </v>
<v Speaker 1>was crushed,</v>

340
00:14:03.990 --> 00:14:04.560
<v Speaker 1>crushed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>crushed,</v>

341
00:14:04.600 --> 00:14:06.250
<v Speaker 1>devastated me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So anyway,</v>

342
00:14:06.260 --> 00:14:07.020
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>

343
00:14:07.050 --> 00:14:12.050
<v Speaker 1>I think Obama's great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>After the first year I realize he's no </v>

344
00:14:12.050 --> 00:14:13.180
<v Speaker 1>different again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm finished.</v>

345
00:14:13.420 --> 00:14:15.850
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's over until 2012.</v>

346
00:14:15.851 --> 00:14:17.950
<v Speaker 1>I hear Gary Johnson speak and people </v>
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>

347
00:14:17.951 --> 00:14:18.550
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Gary John,</v>

348
00:14:18.590 --> 00:14:20.260
<v Speaker 1>he's an awesome speaker.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

349
00:14:20.980 --> 00:14:23.890
<v Speaker 1>but he was a business guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a business guy.</v>

350
00:14:24.310 --> 00:14:25.420
<v Speaker 1>I could hear him.</v>

351
00:14:25.840 --> 00:14:28.120
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't hear anyone else because I </v>
<v Speaker 1>didn't care.</v>

352
00:14:28.390 --> 00:14:33.390
<v Speaker 1>I could only hear the person who I was </v>
<v Speaker 1>identified with him self made man and </v>

353
00:14:33.390 --> 00:14:35.460
<v Speaker 1>growing a business identify with Gary </v>
<v Speaker 1>Johnson.</v>

354
00:14:35.480 --> 00:14:39.820
<v Speaker 1>I still do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so when he decided to talk I said,</v>

355
00:14:39.850 --> 00:14:40.630
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I get it.</v>

356
00:14:40.900 --> 00:14:43.390
<v Speaker 1>And I came to the part because of him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we forward.</v>

357
00:14:43.840 --> 00:14:45.520
<v Speaker 1>I didn't join the party still right </v>
<v Speaker 1>away.</v>

358
00:14:46.030 --> 00:14:47.980
<v Speaker 1>I'd never done a part of my life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd never done a party,</v>

359
00:14:48.700 --> 00:14:50.260
<v Speaker 1>but at this point I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what?</v>

360
00:14:50.320 --> 00:14:54.080
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to go to the meetings and </v>
<v Speaker 1>never been to a party meeting before and</v>

361
00:14:54.120 --> 00:14:59.120
<v Speaker 1>I went to the meetings and when I went </v>
<v Speaker 1>to Libertarian party meetings as odd as </v>

362
00:14:59.120 --> 00:15:01.700
<v Speaker 1>they were and they are odd,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was still just regular people.</v>

363
00:15:02.420 --> 00:15:04.520
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was regular people,</v>

364
00:15:04.580 --> 00:15:09.580
<v Speaker 1>business owners,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people who wanted to see some change </v>

365
00:15:09.580 --> 00:15:09.770
<v Speaker 1>identified quickly with them and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>joined.</v>

366
00:15:10.250 --> 00:15:12.860
<v Speaker 1>So I joined the Party in 2012 and that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I became a libertarian.</v>

367
00:15:13.550 --> 00:15:16.400
<v Speaker 1>But when I joined the party I hadn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>read.</v>

368
00:15:17.030 --> 00:15:19.630
<v Speaker 1>I hadn't read for.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't read any of them had had.</v>

369
00:15:19.640 --> 00:15:22.190
<v Speaker 1>I didn't even know them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's when I joined them.</v>

370
00:15:22.280 --> 00:15:27.280
<v Speaker 1>I began looking around and then I then I</v>
<v Speaker 1>read the law [inaudible] my favorite of </v>

371
00:15:27.280 --> 00:15:27.280
<v Speaker 1>all them was his boss,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yet it's my favorite.</v>

372
00:15:27.280 --> 00:15:31.490
<v Speaker 1>That was the simplest and the one that </v>
<v Speaker 1>identified with the most still my </v>

373
00:15:31.490 --> 00:15:31.490
<v Speaker 1>favorite,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I read all the rest.</v>

374
00:15:31.490 --> 00:15:31.490
<v Speaker 1>Also.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I began to read them.</v>

375
00:15:31.490 --> 00:15:33.080
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I read the word road to serfdom.</v>

376
00:15:33.081 --> 00:15:38.081
<v Speaker 1>I began to read those afterwards,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they were easy for me to understand </v>

377
00:15:38.081 --> 00:15:38.560
<v Speaker 1>that people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they tease me.</v>

378
00:15:38.561 --> 00:15:40.700
<v Speaker 1>The Larry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've been in the movement so short,</v>

379
00:15:40.780 --> 00:15:41.690
<v Speaker 1>short time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you can.</v>

380
00:15:41.930 --> 00:15:46.930
<v Speaker 1>You can talk with the principals.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've been teaching them for 14 years but</v>

381
00:15:47.301 --> 00:15:49.670
<v Speaker 1>not under the name,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

382
00:15:49.700 --> 00:15:54.700
<v Speaker 1>In a different world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it was very easy to adapt and to </v>

383
00:15:54.700 --> 00:15:55.550
<v Speaker 1>bring those,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those things to bear.</v>

384
00:15:55.670 --> 00:16:00.670
<v Speaker 1>So bought for Gary Johnson in 2012 and I</v>
<v Speaker 1>support his candidacy completely in </v>

385
00:16:00.670 --> 00:16:04.901
<v Speaker 1>2016.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was running around doing debates in </v>

386
00:16:04.901 --> 00:16:07.541
<v Speaker 1>his stead.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was on TV instead for him and then he </v>

387
00:16:07.541 --> 00:16:10.350
<v Speaker 1>wanted I would do so I jumped through </v>
<v Speaker 1>hoops for them because I wish he was a </v>

388
00:16:10.350 --> 00:16:12.851
<v Speaker 1>president now when she was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I don't want to Belabor the point </v>

389
00:16:12.851 --> 00:16:12.851
<v Speaker 1>where Gary,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I voted for Gary,</v>

390
00:16:12.851 --> 00:16:17.840
<v Speaker 1>I did a video in the summer before the </v>
<v Speaker 1>election of why it would be great to </v>

391
00:16:17.840 --> 00:16:18.410
<v Speaker 1>support him even though he wasn't a </v>
<v Speaker 1>perfect candidate,</v>

392
00:16:18.411 --> 00:16:19.160
<v Speaker 1>et Cetera,</v>
<v Speaker 1>et cetera.</v>

393
00:16:19.640 --> 00:16:21.650
<v Speaker 1>But he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he had a couple of gaps that were pretty</v>

394
00:16:21.651 --> 00:16:26.651
<v Speaker 1>bad and I also,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't even blame him for them in a </v>

395
00:16:26.651 --> 00:16:26.651
<v Speaker 1>certain way because it was the only to </v>
<v Speaker 1>your point,</v>

396
00:16:26.750 --> 00:16:28.520
<v Speaker 1>it was the only way he could get </v>
<v Speaker 1>pressed.</v>

397
00:16:28.520 --> 00:16:33.520
<v Speaker 1>Like the only time they talked about him</v>
<v Speaker 1>was Aleppo apps or the other moment </v>

398
00:16:33.520 --> 00:16:34.790
<v Speaker 1>where he couldn't name a leader that he </v>
<v Speaker 1>respected.</v>

399
00:16:35.120 --> 00:16:40.120
<v Speaker 1>But the one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the one policy point that really </v>

400
00:16:40.120 --> 00:16:42.701
<v Speaker 1>bothered me with him and I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe maybe we don't see eye to eye on </v>

401
00:16:42.701 --> 00:16:45.461
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that he wanted the baker to bake the </v>

402
00:16:45.461 --> 00:16:45.461
<v Speaker 1>cake.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

403
00:16:45.461 --> 00:16:49.421
<v Speaker 1>let me touch to two of those things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The first thing is every problem that </v>

404
00:16:49.421 --> 00:16:51.950
<v Speaker 1>Gary Johnson had is fixed with good </v>
<v Speaker 1>advisors.</v>

405
00:16:52.730 --> 00:16:53.440
<v Speaker 1>Everyone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

406
00:16:53.720 --> 00:16:56.090
<v Speaker 1>Repaired was good advisors.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Every problem you had,</v>

407
00:16:56.360 --> 00:16:57.470
<v Speaker 1>you get him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Good advisors,</v>

408
00:16:57.740 --> 00:17:02.740
<v Speaker 1>fixed Clinton and trump.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't care who you put in front of </v>

409
00:17:02.740 --> 00:17:02.740
<v Speaker 1>them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's irrelevant.</v>

410
00:17:03.110 --> 00:17:04.790
<v Speaker 1>Who Do you put?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whatever team you put in for them.</v>

411
00:17:04.850 --> 00:17:08.030
<v Speaker 1>They have character flaws.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Johnson doesn't have that.</v>

412
00:17:08.510 --> 00:17:10.680
<v Speaker 1>So you as a human being,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's.</v>

413
00:17:10.710 --> 00:17:12.470
<v Speaker 1>I'm telling you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't have to tell you,</v>

414
00:17:12.471 --> 00:17:17.471
<v Speaker 1>but I mean I sat there with him for an </v>
<v Speaker 1>hour and some time off camera and I </v>

415
00:17:17.471 --> 00:17:17.990
<v Speaker 1>thought this is a decent human hundred </v>
<v Speaker 1>percent.</v>

416
00:17:17.990 --> 00:17:18.620
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm with you.</v>

417
00:17:18.650 --> 00:17:23.650
<v Speaker 1>So if I had a choice,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd rather be president now without </v>

418
00:17:23.650 --> 00:17:24.230
<v Speaker 1>question of course.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the second was to bake the cake.</v>

419
00:17:24.650 --> 00:17:29.650
<v Speaker 1>He didn't do a good job explaining what </v>
<v Speaker 1>he really meant and I let me try to </v>

420
00:17:29.650 --> 00:17:33.281
<v Speaker 1>explain it to make it clearer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He understood the cultural aspects of </v>

421
00:17:33.281 --> 00:17:35.660
<v Speaker 1>this as do I as a person of color,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

422
00:17:35.661 --> 00:17:39.170
<v Speaker 1>There is a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>we've had literally decades,</v>

423
00:17:39.171 --> 00:17:44.150
<v Speaker 1>if not centuries of state sponsored </v>
<v Speaker 1>segregation,</v>

424
00:17:44.390 --> 00:17:46.940
<v Speaker 1>punishment by gender,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by,</v>

425
00:17:47.090 --> 00:17:48.470
<v Speaker 1>by,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by race,</v>

426
00:17:49.060 --> 00:17:54.060
<v Speaker 1>by sexual preference.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is still in the psyche of the </v>

427
00:17:54.060 --> 00:17:58.530
<v Speaker 1>American.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It feels terrible to do what is right,</v>

428
00:17:59.130 --> 00:18:00.270
<v Speaker 1>if that makes any sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

429
00:18:00.450 --> 00:18:03.780
<v Speaker 1>it feels terrible and while the person </v>
<v Speaker 1>goes,</v>

430
00:18:03.781 --> 00:18:05.430
<v Speaker 1>but it's wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I get it,</v>

431
00:18:05.550 --> 00:18:09.300
<v Speaker 1>emotion and culture matter and what he </v>
<v Speaker 1>was trying to get at,</v>

432
00:18:09.301 --> 00:18:14.301
<v Speaker 1>which is my policy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was to find a good solid middle </v>

433
00:18:14.301 --> 00:18:14.301
<v Speaker 1>ground.</v>

434
00:18:14.301 --> 00:18:18.860
<v Speaker 1>I do not want a bigger to make a cake </v>
<v Speaker 1>for someone he doesn't want a make a </v>

435
00:18:18.991 --> 00:18:20.730
<v Speaker 1>cake for.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's his labor.</v>

436
00:18:20.790 --> 00:18:23.580
<v Speaker 1>Having to do it for someone that's wrong</v>
<v Speaker 1>should never happen.</v>

437
00:18:24.270 --> 00:18:27.870
<v Speaker 1>So here is the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here is the good compromise.</v>

438
00:18:28.440 --> 00:18:33.440
<v Speaker 1>If a baker or anyone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>anyone creates a product and puts it </v>

439
00:18:33.840 --> 00:18:38.840
<v Speaker 1>into the retail market,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether that be online or on a shelf in </v>

440
00:18:38.840 --> 00:18:43.191
<v Speaker 1>a store.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If a person gets your product and puts </v>

441
00:18:43.191 --> 00:18:44.300
<v Speaker 1>it there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he must allow anyone who has the current</v>

442
00:18:44.301 --> 00:18:46.380
<v Speaker 1>two that he wants to purchase that </v>
<v Speaker 1>product.</v>

443
00:18:46.540 --> 00:18:47.370
<v Speaker 1>So so far,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

444
00:18:47.400 --> 00:18:50.070
<v Speaker 1>I'm with you so far.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now that you could say,</v>

445
00:18:50.250 --> 00:18:54.060
<v Speaker 1>and purists will say no Larry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He can say no to anyone.</v>

446
00:18:54.120 --> 00:18:59.120
<v Speaker 1>So that would be the set of people who </v>
<v Speaker 1>would like to go back and reverse this </v>

447
00:18:59.120 --> 00:19:02.600
<v Speaker 1>64 civil liberties.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm saying just let now if the person </v>

448
00:19:02.600 --> 00:19:07.491
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want that cake off the shelf and </v>

449
00:19:07.491 --> 00:19:08.790
<v Speaker 1>literally you're Jewish and he's a Nazi </v>
<v Speaker 1>with a swastika.</v>

450
00:19:08.790 --> 00:19:10.560
<v Speaker 1>On his arm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you must say,</v>

451
00:19:10.620 --> 00:19:12.200
<v Speaker 1>take it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have the money to take my ticket out</v>

452
00:19:12.201 --> 00:19:13.330
<v Speaker 1>of here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he told them.</v>

453
00:19:13.500 --> 00:19:16.830
<v Speaker 1>He then says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I now want you to put on it so and so.</v>

454
00:19:17.010 --> 00:19:22.010
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can refuse that service because now </v>

455
00:19:22.010 --> 00:19:25.701
<v Speaker 1>that's not retail.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's you doing a service for that </v>

456
00:19:25.701 --> 00:19:26.580
<v Speaker 1>individual.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You should absolutely be able to say,</v>

457
00:19:26.640 --> 00:19:31.640
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I will not put anything on that cake at </v>

458
00:19:31.640 --> 00:19:31.640
<v Speaker 1>all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the way it is.</v>

459
00:19:31.640 --> 00:19:32.430
<v Speaker 1>That's why I made it for anyone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you want it,</v>

460
00:19:32.730 --> 00:19:34.440
<v Speaker 1>take it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's not good enough for you.</v>

461
00:19:34.500 --> 00:19:38.130
<v Speaker 1>Have a nice day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is my compromise and I think that's</v>

462
00:19:38.131 --> 00:19:43.131
<v Speaker 1>what Gary Johnson actually meant to say </v>
<v Speaker 1>because if you're hurt the way you said </v>

463
00:19:43.131 --> 00:19:43.290
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and when I spoke to him about it,</v>

464
00:19:43.291 --> 00:19:45.360
<v Speaker 1>he understood what I was saying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then I wish I.</v>

465
00:19:45.361 --> 00:19:47.900
<v Speaker 1>I'm because I'm with you on what you </v>
<v Speaker 1>just said this.</v>

466
00:19:47.940 --> 00:19:49.420
<v Speaker 1>I'm with you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm and I want to.</v>

467
00:19:49.440 --> 00:19:54.440
<v Speaker 1>I tried to defend him with that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it didn't come across right and I </v>

468
00:19:54.440 --> 00:19:54.480
<v Speaker 1>think he did that and it because for him</v>
<v Speaker 1>to be fired,</v>

469
00:19:54.481 --> 00:19:55.920
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to defend them and defend </v>
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>

470
00:19:55.921 --> 00:19:58.110
<v Speaker 1>Often.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's emotional for him,</v>

471
00:19:58.111 --> 00:20:01.430
<v Speaker 1>so it didn't come across well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's emotional for me to write.</v>

472
00:20:01.431 --> 00:20:04.170
<v Speaker 1>I know what it's like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know personally what it's like to be.</v>

473
00:20:04.350 --> 00:20:07.470
<v Speaker 1>To be ignored in a restaurant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know what that's like.</v>

474
00:20:08.410 --> 00:20:12.660
<v Speaker 1>Black people don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It feels terrible now to be forward.</v>

475
00:20:12.840 --> 00:20:14.790
<v Speaker 1>I think that's a good compromise.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

476
00:20:14.791 --> 00:20:19.791
<v Speaker 1>so I'm with you on that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm glad you cleaned it up for yourself </v>

477
00:20:19.791 --> 00:20:19.791
<v Speaker 1>and I'm glad you cleaned it up for Gary </v>
<v Speaker 1>because I,</v>

478
00:20:19.791 --> 00:20:23.981
<v Speaker 1>I feel kind of [inaudible] I know he's a</v>
<v Speaker 1>decent guy and I don't like giving him </v>

479
00:20:23.981 --> 00:20:26.751
<v Speaker 1>crap for it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What would you say to the part of the </v>

480
00:20:26.751 --> 00:20:29.421
<v Speaker 1>libertarians that want to go that extra </v>
<v Speaker 1>step and say either the 64 act should be</v>

481
00:20:30.481 --> 00:20:33.540
<v Speaker 1>repealed because we don't need these </v>
<v Speaker 1>laws anymore or that no,</v>

482
00:20:33.541 --> 00:20:34.200
<v Speaker 1>you just.</v>

483
00:20:34.380 --> 00:20:39.380
<v Speaker 1>Even if it's just the same old product </v>
<v Speaker 1>on your shelf and you just don't like </v>

484
00:20:39.380 --> 00:20:40.470
<v Speaker 1>the way somebody looks because you are a</v>
<v Speaker 1>bigot,</v>

485
00:20:40.890 --> 00:20:44.430
<v Speaker 1>it's still your stuff and and what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what do you say?</v>

486
00:20:44.431 --> 00:20:46.770
<v Speaker 1>They are theoretically correct and </v>
<v Speaker 1>realistically wrong,</v>

487
00:20:47.200 --> 00:20:51.340
<v Speaker 1>and if they don't accept the compromise,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're going to get worse.</v>

488
00:20:52.240 --> 00:20:55.130
<v Speaker 1>This is the problem that a lot of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>more hard libertarians don't know.</v>

489
00:20:55.140 --> 00:20:56.980
<v Speaker 1>Is that clear?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love them.</v>

490
00:20:56.981 --> 00:20:58.960
<v Speaker 1>I want them in the party.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They are critical.</v>

491
00:20:59.080 --> 00:21:03.220
<v Speaker 1>They are the backbone of the party.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are our harshest and most powerful</v>

492
00:21:03.221 --> 00:21:04.630
<v Speaker 1>activists.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We need them.</v>

493
00:21:04.710 --> 00:21:06.340
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you believe that that's not based in</v>

494
00:21:06.341 --> 00:21:07.790
<v Speaker 1>bigotry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's no,</v>

495
00:21:08.060 --> 00:21:09.970
<v Speaker 1>that's an adult,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's an important distinction.</v>

496
00:21:09.971 --> 00:21:12.790
<v Speaker 1>It's based on righteousness and they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

497
00:21:13.090 --> 00:21:17.170
<v Speaker 1>The problem is if you don't take that </v>
<v Speaker 1>first step,</v>

498
00:21:17.710 --> 00:21:19.690
<v Speaker 1>you will get nothing but not just </v>
<v Speaker 1>nothing.</v>

499
00:21:19.930 --> 00:21:23.620
<v Speaker 1>Those people who keep voting are going </v>
<v Speaker 1>to keep voting our rights away.</v>

500
00:21:23.860 --> 00:21:28.860
<v Speaker 1>They do it every single year.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They keep voting our rights away as we </v>

501
00:21:29.501 --> 00:21:33.250
<v Speaker 1>accept everything or nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It isn't nothing.</v>

502
00:21:33.370 --> 00:21:35.980
<v Speaker 1>It's worse.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's worse.</v>

503
00:21:36.760 --> 00:21:38.650
<v Speaker 1>Give us the compromise.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That makes sense.</v>

504
00:21:38.860 --> 00:21:43.860
<v Speaker 1>They'll see the world doesn't end.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They'll see this not a zombie </v>

505
00:21:43.860 --> 00:21:44.230
<v Speaker 1>apocalypse,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then we can move to the next level.</v>

506
00:21:44.830 --> 00:21:49.830
<v Speaker 1>Is that part of the problem of being </v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of an outlier party because the </v>

507
00:21:49.830 --> 00:21:51.280
<v Speaker 1>libertarian party that's existed for a </v>
<v Speaker 1>long time and it's an on all the ballots</v>

508
00:21:51.281 --> 00:21:54.400
<v Speaker 1>but never really breaks any major </v>
<v Speaker 1>threshold.</v>

509
00:21:54.790 --> 00:21:58.840
<v Speaker 1>That part of it is you get too caught up</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the purity test.</v>

510
00:21:58.870 --> 00:22:00.390
<v Speaker 1>Now all parties do in a way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but do,</v>

511
00:22:00.500 --> 00:22:05.500
<v Speaker 1>but I think for the third party,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if there's maybe a little trickier and </v>

512
00:22:05.500 --> 00:22:08.251
<v Speaker 1>maybe for libertarians more than als,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because if you're really basing it on </v>

513
00:22:08.251 --> 00:22:09.550
<v Speaker 1>the individual,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the purity test is pretty freaking high,</v>

514
00:22:09.551 --> 00:22:11.590
<v Speaker 1>is what you're going to make that very </v>
<v Speaker 1>clear.</v>

515
00:22:11.890 --> 00:22:13.150
<v Speaker 1>You.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You look at Democrats,</v>

516
00:22:13.151 --> 00:22:15.580
<v Speaker 1>Republicans now they're not actually </v>
<v Speaker 1>parties,</v>

517
00:22:15.581 --> 00:22:18.310
<v Speaker 1>their tribes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I mean that literally their tribes.</v>

518
00:22:18.970 --> 00:22:21.280
<v Speaker 1>You have Weber's the king of the tribe </v>
<v Speaker 1>at the moment.</v>

519
00:22:21.970 --> 00:22:25.600
<v Speaker 1>The will of the king is the platform,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

520
00:22:25.660 --> 00:22:28.480
<v Speaker 1>So whatever trump says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the platform,</v>

521
00:22:28.510 --> 00:22:33.510
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Assuming that Bernie's still top of the </v>

522
00:22:33.510 --> 00:22:33.850
<v Speaker 1>Democrats will be is whoever is right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then that's the platform.</v>

523
00:22:33.890 --> 00:22:36.040
<v Speaker 1>Whoever the person is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the platform.</v>

524
00:22:36.041 --> 00:22:38.750
<v Speaker 1>The platform is whoever is on top of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>part of what you want.</v>

525
00:22:38.760 --> 00:22:41.380
<v Speaker 1>They don't argue as much,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is why they close ranks,</v>

526
00:22:41.650 --> 00:22:42.580
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So easily.</v>

527
00:22:43.220 --> 00:22:45.970
<v Speaker 1>Liquidated probably is different.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It actually has an ideology.</v>

528
00:22:46.930 --> 00:22:49.150
<v Speaker 1>I can call myself king a libertarian if </v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to.</v>

529
00:22:49.330 --> 00:22:52.330
<v Speaker 1>That's not going to go well at all and </v>
<v Speaker 1>no one's gonna.</v>

530
00:22:52.540 --> 00:22:54.730
<v Speaker 1>No one's gonna buy it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's not going to work.</v>

531
00:22:54.731 --> 00:22:58.060
<v Speaker 1>They want to change that language.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is not gonna work at all.</v>

532
00:22:58.420 --> 00:23:03.420
<v Speaker 1>I can say it if I want to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so what I'll get laughed out of the </v>

533
00:23:03.420 --> 00:23:04.150
<v Speaker 1>party because it's not about me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's about audiology,</v>

534
00:23:04.180 --> 00:23:06.820
<v Speaker 1>which is why we argue to be forward with</v>
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>

535
00:23:07.030 --> 00:23:11.080
<v Speaker 1>I'm happy we argue I am because it makes</v>
<v Speaker 1>us a better party.</v>

536
00:23:11.140 --> 00:23:16.140
<v Speaker 1>It makes us clearer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It actually makes policy easier for us </v>

537
00:23:16.140 --> 00:23:16.210
<v Speaker 1>because we don't look at Paul's of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

538
00:23:16.211 --> 00:23:17.920
<v Speaker 1>this policy fits this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

539
00:23:17.921 --> 00:23:21.880
<v Speaker 1>it's based upon based upon audiology,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I'm actually happy that we argue.</v>

540
00:23:22.120 --> 00:23:24.100
<v Speaker 1>I wish we would argue so much as a </v>
<v Speaker 1>publicly.</v>

541
00:23:24.160 --> 00:23:26.020
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the part that drives me crazy,</v>

542
00:23:26.021 --> 00:23:29.350
<v Speaker 1>that we do it so publicly and that we </v>
<v Speaker 1>fight so hard,</v>

543
00:23:29.800 --> 00:23:31.510
<v Speaker 1>but I'm glad we have an idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Again,</v>

544
00:23:31.511 --> 00:23:33.040
<v Speaker 1>I don't know that it's that you guys are</v>
<v Speaker 1>doing.</v>

545
00:23:33.041 --> 00:23:34.570
<v Speaker 1>It's so public.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just that that's the only time that</v>

546
00:23:34.571 --> 00:23:38.470
<v Speaker 1>you're seeing in public.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a bit of an important distinction.</v>

547
00:23:38.560 --> 00:23:43.560
<v Speaker 1>So when you say that the way you just </v>
<v Speaker 1>described the cake situation is </v>

548
00:23:43.560 --> 00:23:44.650
<v Speaker 1>basically your view on government in </v>
<v Speaker 1>general,</v>

549
00:23:44.830 --> 00:23:49.830
<v Speaker 1>because again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is where you can go to a </v>

550
00:23:49.830 --> 00:23:51.671
<v Speaker 1>libertarian that really isn't an endcap </v>
<v Speaker 1>or the people you described as the </v>

551
00:23:51.671 --> 00:23:52.040
<v Speaker 1>backbone that it basically you're sort </v>
<v Speaker 1>of.</v>

552
00:23:52.340 --> 00:23:57.340
<v Speaker 1>I guess I would just.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean this is what I would say </v>

553
00:23:57.340 --> 00:23:58.901
<v Speaker 1>classical liberal is really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just that where the rubber meets </v>

554
00:23:58.901 --> 00:23:59.300
<v Speaker 1>the road,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you understand that there has to be some</v>

555
00:23:59.510 --> 00:24:02.390
<v Speaker 1>level of government.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that sort of your guiding principle?</v>

556
00:24:02.490 --> 00:24:07.490
<v Speaker 1>Like my,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my north star is a full voluntary </v>

557
00:24:07.490 --> 00:24:09.560
<v Speaker 1>society.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's my north star.</v>

558
00:24:10.100 --> 00:24:15.100
<v Speaker 1>I would love to have a total and fully </v>
<v Speaker 1>voluntary society.</v>

559
00:24:15.800 --> 00:24:17.490
<v Speaker 1>How do you define what that is?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Where,</v>

560
00:24:17.530 --> 00:24:20.480
<v Speaker 1>where government is even voluntary.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That would be amazing.</v>

561
00:24:20.840 --> 00:24:24.560
<v Speaker 1>But to be fair with you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>our nation is no where near.</v>

562
00:24:24.640 --> 00:24:25.100
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's.</v>

563
00:24:25.640 --> 00:24:28.010
<v Speaker 1>I modeled was asking you what I'd like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd like.</v>

564
00:24:28.011 --> 00:24:33.011
<v Speaker 1>I'd like a world where leprechauns ride </v>
<v Speaker 1>unicorns at the moment it's the same </v>

565
00:24:33.011 --> 00:24:34.060
<v Speaker 1>thing and it just doesn't exist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

566
00:24:34.140 --> 00:24:39.140
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're nowhere near there and one reason </v>

567
00:24:39.140 --> 00:24:42.070
<v Speaker 1>why I'm attacking New York state as,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as hard as I am campaigning so hard is </v>

568
00:24:42.070 --> 00:24:46.330
<v Speaker 1>if we can just stop the bleeding.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If we can just stop it from shifting lap</v>

569
00:24:46.790 --> 00:24:47.680
<v Speaker 1>right now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and if you know,</v>

570
00:24:47.720 --> 00:24:52.720
<v Speaker 1>we're talking in New York state about </v>
<v Speaker 1>giving teachers the right to tell law </v>

571
00:24:54.081 --> 00:24:59.081
<v Speaker 1>enforcement if a child is dangerous so </v>
<v Speaker 1>they can now confiscate that child's </v>

572
00:24:59.081 --> 00:25:02.450
<v Speaker 1>parents.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Guns were talking about that now.</v>

573
00:25:02.510 --> 00:25:07.400
<v Speaker 1>That's the new them's on New York state </v>
<v Speaker 1>where Joe wed going so far away.</v>

574
00:25:07.401 --> 00:25:09.890
<v Speaker 1>It's not even funny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So talk about this.</v>

575
00:25:10.450 --> 00:25:13.700
<v Speaker 1>It's imaginary.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just want to turn it around.</v>

576
00:25:14.510 --> 00:25:17.000
<v Speaker 1>Let me do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If I do that,</v>

577
00:25:17.080 --> 00:25:18.230
<v Speaker 1>we've got to shout to get in there.</v>

578
00:25:18.590 --> 00:25:21.200
<v Speaker 1>I probably will never see a voluntary </v>
<v Speaker 1>society in my life.</v>

579
00:25:21.230 --> 00:25:23.330
<v Speaker 1>I probably won't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It'd be awesome if I could,</v>

580
00:25:23.840 --> 00:25:28.840
<v Speaker 1>but can I turn us around so we're facing</v>
<v Speaker 1>it at least that I can do that I can </v>

581
00:25:28.840 --> 00:25:30.800
<v Speaker 1>absolutely do and I can do it in my </v>
<v Speaker 1>lifetime.</v>

582
00:25:30.920 --> 00:25:32.930
<v Speaker 1>I can do it in New York state and new in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the country.</v>

583
00:25:33.020 --> 00:25:35.660
<v Speaker 1>We can do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So with that in mind,</v>

584
00:25:35.661 --> 00:25:37.580
<v Speaker 1>and when you talk about the principles </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the party,</v>

585
00:25:37.790 --> 00:25:41.390
<v Speaker 1>how do you generally decide what the </v>
<v Speaker 1>right amount of government is then?</v>

586
00:25:41.540 --> 00:25:46.540
<v Speaker 1>I mean you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you want to be in the government so the </v>

587
00:25:46.540 --> 00:25:46.540
<v Speaker 1>government has to do something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is it,</v>

588
00:25:46.540 --> 00:25:49.640
<v Speaker 1>is it really just on a case by case </v>
<v Speaker 1>basis of both the lightest touch?</v>

589
00:25:49.670 --> 00:25:51.670
<v Speaker 1>It's always okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you.</v>

590
00:25:52.580 --> 00:25:54.500
<v Speaker 1>Have you ever run for office?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not yet.</v>

591
00:25:54.650 --> 00:25:57.770
<v Speaker 1>Alright.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of the reasons why it's so hard.</v>

592
00:25:57.800 --> 00:25:59.480
<v Speaker 1>There's many reasons why one is raising </v>
<v Speaker 1>money,</v>

593
00:25:59.481 --> 00:26:04.481
<v Speaker 1>obviously the one's time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the third one is understanding all </v>

594
00:26:04.481 --> 00:26:07.510
<v Speaker 1>the policies and when you begin to </v>
<v Speaker 1>understand how much government intrusion</v>

595
00:26:07.511 --> 00:26:12.511
<v Speaker 1>in our life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's depressing and I mean that truly </v>

596
00:26:13.340 --> 00:26:18.340
<v Speaker 1>most people have no idea how much </v>
<v Speaker 1>government in truth in our life and how </v>

597
00:26:18.340 --> 00:26:18.340
<v Speaker 1>much ask you hurts.</v>

598
00:26:18.770 --> 00:26:21.710
<v Speaker 1>It's depressing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've policy coals.</v>

599
00:26:21.711 --> 00:26:25.220
<v Speaker 1>Every my policy team,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we were on the phone using anywhere from</v>

600
00:26:25.221 --> 00:26:27.680
<v Speaker 1>an hour to two hours every week and </v>
<v Speaker 1>discussing policy issues.</v>

601
00:26:28.490 --> 00:26:31.880
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes I'm depressed when I'm done </v>
<v Speaker 1>because it's so bad.</v>

602
00:26:32.180 --> 00:26:37.180
<v Speaker 1>There's no good answer because </v>
<v Speaker 1>government problem has been solved with </v>

603
00:26:37.180 --> 00:26:41.561
<v Speaker 1>government bandaid,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which has been solved by government </v>

604
00:26:41.561 --> 00:26:41.561
<v Speaker 1>bandaid,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so if you pull off government bandaid,</v>

605
00:26:41.561 --> 00:26:45.210
<v Speaker 1>you've three more broken bandaids </v>
<v Speaker 1>underneath it that sometimes make things</v>

606
00:26:45.211 --> 00:26:49.050
<v Speaker 1>worse.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes taking government off makes it</v>

607
00:26:49.051 --> 00:26:52.890
<v Speaker 1>worse because of three more band aids </v>
<v Speaker 1>that are all terrible.</v>

608
00:26:53.550 --> 00:26:55.230
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes you have to just say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't touch that.</v>

609
00:26:55.920 --> 00:26:58.950
<v Speaker 1>I just have to let it stay there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you have someone who goes,</v>

610
00:26:58.951 --> 00:27:00.060
<v Speaker 1>but Larry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's wrong.</v>

611
00:27:00.061 --> 00:27:01.080
<v Speaker 1>That righteous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's easy.</v>

612
00:27:01.081 --> 00:27:04.800
<v Speaker 1>We have to stop it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are 3000 things I have to fix.</v>

613
00:27:05.100 --> 00:27:08.250
<v Speaker 1>Some I just can't put on my radar.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So yes,</v>

614
00:27:08.251 --> 00:27:13.251
<v Speaker 1>it's always case by case to try to fix </v>
<v Speaker 1>government is a Herculean task that no </v>

615
00:27:14.521 --> 00:27:14.910
<v Speaker 1>one could do.</v>

616
00:27:15.570 --> 00:27:20.570
<v Speaker 1>What do you make of the states like New </v>
<v Speaker 1>York that have gotten so away from the </v>

617
00:27:20.581 --> 00:27:22.770
<v Speaker 1>ideas?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Forget the policies,</v>

618
00:27:22.771 --> 00:27:24.810
<v Speaker 1>forget the 3000 problems.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

619
00:27:25.110 --> 00:27:30.110
<v Speaker 1>But just the basic ideas of why liberty </v>
<v Speaker 1>and individualism and limited government</v>

620
00:27:30.841 --> 00:27:35.841
<v Speaker 1>and your own capacity to control your </v>
<v Speaker 1>property and things of that nature that </v>

621
00:27:35.841 --> 00:27:36.870
<v Speaker 1>the states that have gotten so far away </v>
<v Speaker 1>from that.</v>

622
00:27:37.400 --> 00:27:38.000
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>

623
00:27:38.050 --> 00:27:39.410
<v Speaker 1>I guess that's why you're running in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>first.</v>

624
00:27:39.630 --> 00:27:41.700
<v Speaker 1>It's culture.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People ask all the time,</v>

625
00:27:41.730 --> 00:27:42.570
<v Speaker 1>they say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

626
00:27:42.640 --> 00:27:44.160
<v Speaker 1>what are your first hundred days and to </v>
<v Speaker 1>be like,</v>

627
00:27:44.161 --> 00:27:49.161
<v Speaker 1>and what are you gonna Change?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They think I'm going to walk into New </v>

628
00:27:49.161 --> 00:27:50.730
<v Speaker 1>York state as governor and wave my magic</v>
<v Speaker 1>wand or bring up my guy.</v>

629
00:27:50.760 --> 00:27:52.680
<v Speaker 1>I'm the kid now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everything changes.</v>

630
00:27:53.250 --> 00:27:55.470
<v Speaker 1>Of course not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't want to.</v>

631
00:27:55.471 --> 00:28:00.471
<v Speaker 1>If I could write,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't and I wouldn't want to if I </v>

632
00:28:00.471 --> 00:28:04.161
<v Speaker 1>could.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That kind of fast change makes people </v>

633
00:28:04.161 --> 00:28:05.100
<v Speaker 1>afraid and here's the reason to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>clear.</v>

634
00:28:05.100 --> 00:28:07.860
<v Speaker 1>It's all about fear.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When people are afraid,</v>

635
00:28:08.430 --> 00:28:11.850
<v Speaker 1>they make bad decisions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that simply human nature.</v>

636
00:28:12.360 --> 00:28:16.440
<v Speaker 1>Fear makes bad decisions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fear is the root of aggression.</v>

637
00:28:17.460 --> 00:28:22.460
<v Speaker 1>Government at the end of his law,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at the end of every law was a couple of </v>

638
00:28:22.460 --> 00:28:23.400
<v Speaker 1>minor exceptions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but almost every law,</v>

639
00:28:23.520 --> 00:28:27.480
<v Speaker 1>the of everyone is a guy or a Gal with a</v>
<v Speaker 1>gun put you in a cage,</v>

640
00:28:28.020 --> 00:28:32.370
<v Speaker 1>which means by default law is force.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Government is force.</v>

641
00:28:32.790 --> 00:28:33.930
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>should we never used for us?</v>

642
00:28:34.120 --> 00:28:34.410
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

643
00:28:34.411 --> 00:28:36.950
<v Speaker 1>You can use force to defend your rights </v>
<v Speaker 1>property.</v>

644
00:28:37.290 --> 00:28:40.290
<v Speaker 1>He didn't use force,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but when you are afraid,</v>

645
00:28:41.250 --> 00:28:44.910
<v Speaker 1>you're first step is force,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so when you are afraid,</v>

646
00:28:45.120 --> 00:28:50.120
<v Speaker 1>you're first step is government and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what happens in the states like </v>

647
00:28:50.120 --> 00:28:50.120
<v Speaker 1>New York,</v>
<v Speaker 1>California.</v>

648
00:28:50.120 --> 00:28:51.780
<v Speaker 1>The first answer is government.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the old,</v>

649
00:28:51.900 --> 00:28:54.180
<v Speaker 1>there oughta be a law.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't like this.</v>

650
00:28:54.350 --> 00:28:56.460
<v Speaker 1>They want to be a law.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is wrong.</v>

651
00:28:56.790 --> 00:29:01.790
<v Speaker 1>There were to be a law and that culture </v>
<v Speaker 1>has been part of us for at least 50 </v>

652
00:29:01.790 --> 00:29:01.790
<v Speaker 1>years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if not more.</v>

653
00:29:01.790 --> 00:29:04.680
<v Speaker 1>I mean just decades upon decades has </v>
<v Speaker 1>been that way.</v>

654
00:29:05.070 --> 00:29:07.050
<v Speaker 1>I see the same thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

655
00:29:07.260 --> 00:29:12.260
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>someone's smoking in front of me to </v>

656
00:29:12.260 --> 00:29:12.450
<v Speaker 1>think the same way until I was </v>
<v Speaker 1>enlightening.</v>

657
00:29:12.451 --> 00:29:13.440
<v Speaker 1>Go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh no,</v>

658
00:29:13.441 --> 00:29:15.450
<v Speaker 1>that's a bad idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why would I do that?</v>

659
00:29:15.680 --> 00:29:20.680
<v Speaker 1>But I thought I was righteous and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing that we have to remember is we </v>

660
00:29:20.680 --> 00:29:24.360
<v Speaker 1>also idealize the idea of democracy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We idolize when we voted,</v>

661
00:29:24.960 --> 00:29:27.360
<v Speaker 1>there's a law.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The story I love,</v>

662
00:29:27.361 --> 00:29:30.750
<v Speaker 1>I tell this whole time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was speaking to an Ip attorney,</v>

663
00:29:30.751 --> 00:29:35.751
<v Speaker 1>intellectual property attorney,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and she was talking to me about </v>

664
00:29:35.751 --> 00:29:35.751
<v Speaker 1>intellectual property law and I'm making</v>
<v Speaker 1>this up.</v>

665
00:29:35.751 --> 00:29:37.710
<v Speaker 1>I don't remember the actual rules.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So she said something,</v>

666
00:29:37.711 --> 00:29:38.940
<v Speaker 1>and again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not a lawyer,</v>

667
00:29:39.030 --> 00:29:41.440
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to just say numbers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we have some,</v>

668
00:29:42.040 --> 00:29:47.040
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>after the copyright law is 95 years </v>

669
00:29:47.040 --> 00:29:49.360
<v Speaker 1>after the person's death.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was something like that and I said 95</v>

670
00:29:49.390 --> 00:29:50.560
<v Speaker 1>years after her death,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she goes,</v>

671
00:29:50.590 --> 00:29:50.980
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

672
00:29:51.520 --> 00:29:52.600
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what a terrible law.</v>

673
00:29:52.810 --> 00:29:54.670
<v Speaker 1>It's horrible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She said,</v>

674
00:29:54.730 --> 00:29:55.900
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's a law.</v>

675
00:29:57.070 --> 00:29:59.470
<v Speaker 1>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not doubting that your lawyer.</v>

676
00:29:59.471 --> 00:30:02.920
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure you know the law.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure that's true and it's a bad law.</v>

677
00:30:03.470 --> 00:30:08.470
<v Speaker 1>She said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you understand we had to change our </v>

678
00:30:08.470 --> 00:30:10.120
<v Speaker 1>laws to match international law.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So now we match international law.</v>

679
00:30:10.180 --> 00:30:11.110
<v Speaker 1>And I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>great,</v>

680
00:30:11.230 --> 00:30:16.230
<v Speaker 1>that's a really bad international law.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She looked like she was angry at me </v>

681
00:30:16.810 --> 00:30:21.640
<v Speaker 1>because in her eyes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>law equals righteousness that the same.</v>

682
00:30:22.270 --> 00:30:27.270
<v Speaker 1>There's no difference.</v>
<v Speaker 1>International law equals extra </v>

683
00:30:27.270 --> 00:30:27.670
<v Speaker 1>righteousness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just,</v>

684
00:30:27.671 --> 00:30:31.180
<v Speaker 1>it's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So she was mad at me because in her eyes</v>

685
00:30:31.450 --> 00:30:32.170
<v Speaker 1>I was a heretic.</v>

686
00:30:33.670 --> 00:30:36.400
<v Speaker 1>That's how she saw me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now she didn't make the law.</v>

687
00:30:36.401 --> 00:30:41.401
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't her idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She was not congress congressperson who </v>

688
00:30:41.401 --> 00:30:41.401
<v Speaker 1>did it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

689
00:30:41.401 --> 00:30:42.850
<v Speaker 1>she's simply a priest of the law and I'm</v>
<v Speaker 1>a heretic.</v>

690
00:30:43.390 --> 00:30:45.460
<v Speaker 1>And she was mad at me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they might think,</v>

691
00:30:45.461 --> 00:30:49.060
<v Speaker 1>well that's when we lawyers guide </v>
<v Speaker 1>department of buildings in New York.</v>

692
00:30:49.510 --> 00:30:51.040
<v Speaker 1>I'm talking to him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this guys educated,</v>

693
00:30:51.130 --> 00:30:52.810
<v Speaker 1>smart,</v>
<v Speaker 1>credentialed.</v>

694
00:30:53.950 --> 00:30:54.610
<v Speaker 1>I say to him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I say,</v>

695
00:30:54.611 --> 00:30:59.611
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm kinda curious about the landmarking </v>

696
00:30:59.611 --> 00:31:01.531
<v Speaker 1>law and if you may not know landmarking </v>
<v Speaker 1>in New York City is when you can </v>

697
00:31:01.531 --> 00:31:01.531
<v Speaker 1>actually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

698
00:31:01.531 --> 00:31:04.680
<v Speaker 1>kind of a community can say this </v>
<v Speaker 1>property's landmarked and now nothing </v>

699
00:31:04.680 --> 00:31:06.130
<v Speaker 1>can be done to that property unless the </v>
<v Speaker 1>community agrees.</v>

700
00:31:06.670 --> 00:31:11.670
<v Speaker 1>Lots of people want it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They want to protect their community so </v>

701
00:31:11.670 --> 00:31:11.670
<v Speaker 1>that developers can come in and do it </v>
<v Speaker 1>all the time.</v>

702
00:31:11.670 --> 00:31:12.860
<v Speaker 1>Is that just for a building or is that </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually.</v>

703
00:31:12.910 --> 00:31:14.880
<v Speaker 1>Can it be for like a group of buildings </v>
<v Speaker 1>are a part of thing?</v>

704
00:31:14.980 --> 00:31:19.980
<v Speaker 1>I think it's one building at a time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm pretty sure it's one property at a </v>

705
00:31:19.980 --> 00:31:19.980
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

706
00:31:19.980 --> 00:31:21.070
<v Speaker 1>But actually doing groups,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think it's one property at a time.</v>

707
00:31:21.610 --> 00:31:26.610
<v Speaker 1>So you can also have that happen to you </v>
<v Speaker 1>without you wanting the community can </v>

708
00:31:26.841 --> 00:31:28.810
<v Speaker 1>just landmark your property.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That can happen.</v>

709
00:31:28.980 --> 00:31:33.980
<v Speaker 1>And it has happened a couple times.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So now documentary landmarks your </v>

710
00:31:33.980 --> 00:31:33.980
<v Speaker 1>property.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I totally,</v>

711
00:31:33.980 --> 00:31:33.980
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how is that okay?</v>

712
00:31:33.980 --> 00:31:36.040
<v Speaker 1>I don't understand how that works.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the guy told me,</v>

713
00:31:36.041 --> 00:31:41.041
<v Speaker 1>Larry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the same lower use for when that </v>

714
00:31:41.041 --> 00:31:41.041
<v Speaker 1>building is condemned.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I said,</v>

715
00:31:41.041 --> 00:31:41.530
<v Speaker 1>ah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that makes sense.</v>

716
00:31:41.531 --> 00:31:42.850
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Condemning makes sense.</v>

717
00:31:42.880 --> 00:31:46.120
<v Speaker 1>If a building collapses,</v>
<v Speaker 1>thousands could die.</v>

718
00:31:46.420 --> 00:31:49.210
<v Speaker 1>Totally makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I see a victim got that law.</v>

719
00:31:49.300 --> 00:31:52.040
<v Speaker 1>I'm in good when it comes to </v>
<v Speaker 1>landmarking,</v>

720
00:31:52.350 --> 00:31:54.220
<v Speaker 1>where's victim?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He went,</v>

721
00:31:54.221 --> 00:31:54.400
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

722
00:31:54.401 --> 00:31:55.030
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't understand.</v>

723
00:31:55.031 --> 00:31:58.480
<v Speaker 1>It's the same law we use.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I get that.</v>

724
00:31:58.540 --> 00:32:01.620
<v Speaker 1>Totally get it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Where's the victim laterally?</v>

725
00:32:01.621 --> 00:32:06.621
<v Speaker 1>It's St Law because in his eyes again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>law equals righteousness.</v>

726
00:32:07.630 --> 00:32:12.630
<v Speaker 1>This is the mindset we have in for many </v>
<v Speaker 1>Americans and we have to break that </v>

727
00:32:12.630 --> 00:32:14.350
<v Speaker 1>mindset.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The idea that just because it's a law,</v>

728
00:32:14.400 --> 00:32:15.940
<v Speaker 1>does it make it righteous?</v>
<v Speaker 1>By default,</v>

729
00:32:16.210 --> 00:32:19.000
<v Speaker 1>lots of laws have been bad and been </v>
<v Speaker 1>overturned in a wrong.</v>

730
00:32:19.210 --> 00:32:21.520
<v Speaker 1>Lots of them are low,</v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't make it righteous,</v>

731
00:32:21.820 --> 00:32:23.260
<v Speaker 1>but we say it will be voted</v>

732
00:32:25.340 --> 00:32:26.450
<v Speaker 1>now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Becomes okay now.</v>

733
00:32:26.600 --> 00:32:27.620
<v Speaker 1>Great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I vote.</v>

734
00:32:27.621 --> 00:32:29.390
<v Speaker 1>You give me all your stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Awesome.</v>

735
00:32:29.780 --> 00:32:32.030
<v Speaker 1>I guess you have to be very self now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can have all my stuff.</v>

736
00:32:32.230 --> 00:32:33.110
<v Speaker 1>Well there we go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But.</v>

737
00:32:33.130 --> 00:32:38.130
<v Speaker 1>But I voted so we've got a problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I try to tell people when I go through </v>

738
00:32:38.130 --> 00:32:41.831
<v Speaker 1>New York state,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm trying to change the concept of </v>

739
00:32:41.831 --> 00:32:41.831
<v Speaker 1>right now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>government,</v>

740
00:32:41.831 --> 00:32:44.450
<v Speaker 1>most of the time it's just this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It enforces the will of the majority.</v>

741
00:32:45.770 --> 00:32:50.770
<v Speaker 1>I want government's primary purpose to </v>
<v Speaker 1>be to instead defend the rights of the </v>

742
00:32:50.770 --> 00:32:55.541
<v Speaker 1>individual specifically when you have </v>
<v Speaker 1>localization from the local believers </v>

743
00:32:55.541 --> 00:32:58.310
<v Speaker 1>who will pop up because local bullies </v>
<v Speaker 1>will always pop up.</v>

744
00:32:59.030 --> 00:33:04.030
<v Speaker 1>But now local bullies are validated by </v>
<v Speaker 1>the big government because you voted so </v>

745
00:33:05.391 --> 00:33:07.310
<v Speaker 1>local.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bullies have more power than ever.</v>

746
00:33:08.240 --> 00:33:10.760
<v Speaker 1>Instead,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the state government should be defending</v>

747
00:33:10.761 --> 00:33:13.220
<v Speaker 1>the individual against local police </v>
<v Speaker 1>against him.</v>

748
00:33:13.221 --> 00:33:18.221
<v Speaker 1>That domain against property tax hikes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>against speeding tickets that are $405 </v>

749
00:33:19.370 --> 00:33:21.980
<v Speaker 1>for a speeding ticket.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This would be defending them against the</v>

750
00:33:21.981 --> 00:33:23.300
<v Speaker 1>local bullies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But we're not.</v>

751
00:33:23.460 --> 00:33:28.460
<v Speaker 2>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so let's talk about some of the unique </v>

752
00:33:28.460 --> 00:33:28.690
<v Speaker 2>issues in New York because although a </v>
<v Speaker 2>lot of states have,</v>

753
00:33:28.691 --> 00:33:30.930
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a big city and then a rural area,</v>

754
00:33:30.960 --> 00:33:35.960
<v Speaker 2>New York really has it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I remember growing up in New York </v>

755
00:33:35.960 --> 00:33:35.960
<v Speaker 2>where there were always,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

756
00:33:35.960 --> 00:33:38.500
<v Speaker 2>I'd read Newsday was the long island </v>
<v Speaker 2>paper and they were always talking about</v>

757
00:33:38.501 --> 00:33:43.501
<v Speaker 2>the fights between New York City and </v>
<v Speaker 2>Albany because we have this huge rural </v>

758
00:33:43.501 --> 00:33:47.701
<v Speaker 2>upstate area.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The upstate area right now is extremely </v>

759
00:33:47.701 --> 00:33:48.760
<v Speaker 2>economically depressed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I went to Suny Binghamton.</v>

760
00:33:48.761 --> 00:33:51.320
<v Speaker 2>I know the area pretty well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

761
00:33:51.490 --> 00:33:54.880
<v Speaker 2>how do you deal with someone that wants </v>
<v Speaker 2>to be the governor of the state,</v>

762
00:33:54.881 --> 00:33:58.210
<v Speaker 2>the chief executor of the state.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How do you deal with having,</v>

763
00:33:58.630 --> 00:34:03.630
<v Speaker 2>what is it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Something around like 8 million people </v>

764
00:34:03.630 --> 00:34:03.630
<v Speaker 2>and a half million people in New York </v>
<v Speaker 2>City.</v>

765
00:34:03.630 --> 00:34:04.960
<v Speaker 2>Sixty dollars million in metro area.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If few includes pots,</v>

766
00:34:04.980 --> 00:34:06.040
<v Speaker 2>Connecticut,</v>
<v Speaker 2>New Jersey,</v>

767
00:34:06.041 --> 00:34:08.770
<v Speaker 2>Long Island parts of a Westchester </v>
<v Speaker 2>County.</v>

768
00:34:08.771 --> 00:34:10.330
<v Speaker 2>So it's about 16 million metro area.</v>

769
00:34:10.840 --> 00:34:13.330
<v Speaker 1>It's New York City is the largest city </v>
<v Speaker 1>in America.</v>

770
00:34:13.900 --> 00:34:18.340
<v Speaker 1>And by far it's over double La.</v>
<v Speaker 1>La is the second and it's over double.</v>

771
00:34:18.790 --> 00:34:20.980
<v Speaker 1>So it is by far the largest city in </v>
<v Speaker 1>America.</v>

772
00:34:21.190 --> 00:34:24.610
<v Speaker 1>There are more people in one of our </v>
<v Speaker 1>boroughs then at least 10 states,</v>

773
00:34:25.080 --> 00:34:30.080
<v Speaker 1>just one of our girls.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are more people in New York City </v>

774
00:34:30.080 --> 00:34:30.080
<v Speaker 1>than there are in 40 states.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's how big we are.</v>

775
00:34:30.080 --> 00:34:31.180
<v Speaker 1>We're massive there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Are there,</v>

776
00:34:31.181 --> 00:34:36.181
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but not just that New York City is very </v>

777
00:34:36.181 --> 00:34:38.461
<v Speaker 1>unique in that about one third of its </v>
<v Speaker 1>population is not born in the country </v>

778
00:34:38.461 --> 00:34:40.950
<v Speaker 1>and another about one third is not born </v>
<v Speaker 1>in India,</v>

779
00:34:40.960 --> 00:34:44.170
<v Speaker 1>in the city.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we are literally a magnet for talent,</v>

780
00:34:45.280 --> 00:34:48.580
<v Speaker 1>which is why because we're a magnet for </v>
<v Speaker 1>talent and we have 60 million people who</v>

781
00:34:48.581 --> 00:34:50.830
<v Speaker 1>are possible candidates for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

782
00:34:50.920 --> 00:34:52.780
<v Speaker 1>customers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>candidates for,</v>

783
00:34:52.781 --> 00:34:56.380
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for jobs we can basically be a communist</v>

784
00:34:56.381 --> 00:34:58.450
<v Speaker 1>state and still function,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

785
00:34:58.450 --> 00:35:00.190
<v Speaker 1>Because we have so many advantages.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Our,</v>

786
00:35:00.250 --> 00:35:05.250
<v Speaker 1>our advantages are so high.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's people say how can you possibly </v>

787
00:35:05.250 --> 00:35:09.631
<v Speaker 1>work in New York City?</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's so many advantages and we have </v>

788
00:35:09.631 --> 00:35:11.290
<v Speaker 1>the massive vantage of finance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean finance is a massive put up.</v>

789
00:35:11.291 --> 00:35:13.510
<v Speaker 1>New Exam.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Manhattan's infrastructure is huge.</v>

790
00:35:13.570 --> 00:35:15.820
<v Speaker 1>So basically the machine just keeps </v>
<v Speaker 1>churning.</v>

791
00:35:15.821 --> 00:35:17.170
<v Speaker 1>That's correct.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Through people,</v>

792
00:35:17.171 --> 00:35:18.250
<v Speaker 1>through jobs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>through everything else.</v>

793
00:35:18.251 --> 00:35:19.960
<v Speaker 1>So the more we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the more you push out,</v>

794
00:35:19.961 --> 00:35:21.790
<v Speaker 1>the more you bring in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely.</v>

795
00:35:21.860 --> 00:35:22.430
<v Speaker 1>So the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

796
00:35:22.450 --> 00:35:26.260
<v Speaker 1>so it just keeps happening.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The rest of the state is not that way at</v>

797
00:35:26.261 --> 00:35:27.280
<v Speaker 1>all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Less than New York,</v>

798
00:35:27.281 --> 00:35:28.090
<v Speaker 1>central,</v>
<v Speaker 1>New York,</v>

799
00:35:28.270 --> 00:35:28.960
<v Speaker 1>northern,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

800
00:35:28.990 --> 00:35:30.720
<v Speaker 1>northern country,</v>
<v Speaker 1>southern tier,</v>

801
00:35:30.760 --> 00:35:32.320
<v Speaker 1>Long Island,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very different,</v>

802
00:35:32.650 --> 00:35:37.650
<v Speaker 1>different.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And one of the things I'm doing is I'm </v>

803
00:35:37.650 --> 00:35:37.650
<v Speaker 1>trying to show them something very </v>
<v Speaker 1>important.</v>

804
00:35:37.890 --> 00:35:42.890
<v Speaker 1>This has to come down to localization.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's making government smaller in </v>

805
00:35:42.890 --> 00:35:43.830
<v Speaker 1>general,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

806
00:35:43.831 --> 00:35:46.500
<v Speaker 1>Neil says several problems as you talked</v>
<v Speaker 1>about the city from the rest,</v>

807
00:35:46.501 --> 00:35:49.200
<v Speaker 1>which is very different,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but also 70 percent of New Yorkers don't</v>

808
00:35:49.201 --> 00:35:51.480
<v Speaker 1>vote in certain counties upstate.</v>

809
00:35:51.540 --> 00:35:54.030
<v Speaker 1>Only one in seven votes they've given </v>
<v Speaker 1>up.</v>

810
00:35:54.540 --> 00:35:56.190
<v Speaker 1>They've just given up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's learned helplessness,</v>

811
00:35:56.580 --> 00:35:57.870
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They just totally given up.</v>

812
00:35:58.140 --> 00:36:03.140
<v Speaker 1>And we have over 100,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>New Yorkers leaving our state every </v>

813
00:36:03.140 --> 00:36:07.190
<v Speaker 1>single year over 100,000,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but a million in the last eight years </v>

814
00:36:07.190 --> 00:36:07.190
<v Speaker 1>walking away.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now you say,</v>

815
00:36:07.190 --> 00:36:12.021
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And walking away New York City must be </v>

816
00:36:12.021 --> 00:36:12.021
<v Speaker 1>getting killed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No nukes.</v>

817
00:36:12.021 --> 00:36:12.120
<v Speaker 1>He's about imagine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>same or higher,</v>

818
00:36:12.630 --> 00:36:14.850
<v Speaker 1>all coming from upstate western New </v>
<v Speaker 1>York,</v>

819
00:36:14.851 --> 00:36:16.470
<v Speaker 1>all coming from,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of leaving his youth flight.</v>

820
00:36:16.760 --> 00:36:21.760
<v Speaker 1>All our young people are gonna.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Educate and leaving or leaving an </v>

821
00:36:21.760 --> 00:36:21.760
<v Speaker 1>educating someplace else,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not coming back.</v>

822
00:36:21.760 --> 00:36:23.160
<v Speaker 1>Is that mostly a tax issue?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sorry?</v>

823
00:36:23.161 --> 00:36:25.560
<v Speaker 1>Is that mostly a tax issue or to drive?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's everything.</v>

824
00:36:25.650 --> 00:36:28.410
<v Speaker 1>It's high cost of living,</v>
<v Speaker 1>new opportunities.</v>

825
00:36:28.650 --> 00:36:29.520
<v Speaker 1>Those who,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these combined,</v>

826
00:36:30.030 --> 00:36:35.030
<v Speaker 1>but it can't change because we have a </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing called unfunded mandates and is </v>

827
00:36:36.480 --> 00:36:38.070
<v Speaker 1>devastating our state and what does that</v>
<v Speaker 1>mean?</v>

828
00:36:38.071 --> 00:36:43.071
<v Speaker 1>That means in a given county up to 95,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sometimes over 100 percent of the budget</v>

829
00:36:44.130 --> 00:36:47.580
<v Speaker 1>is already mandated by Albany or capital</v>
<v Speaker 1>or by DC.</v>

830
00:36:48.450 --> 00:36:51.420
<v Speaker 1>So who's running the county?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Someone else's.</v>

831
00:36:51.480 --> 00:36:56.480
<v Speaker 1>Why show up?</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have local cities and towns where we </v>

832
00:36:56.480 --> 00:36:58.020
<v Speaker 1>don't have enough people to fill all the</v>
<v Speaker 1>billets for people.</v>

833
00:36:58.021 --> 00:36:59.070
<v Speaker 1>Show up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

834
00:36:59.071 --> 00:37:01.080
<v Speaker 1>I guess you're the chair.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm the vice chair.</v>

835
00:37:01.081 --> 00:37:03.570
<v Speaker 1>You're cemetery because we're here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>

836
00:37:03.571 --> 00:37:05.790
<v Speaker 1>and no one else shows up ever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Unless they're angry,</v>

837
00:37:06.540 --> 00:37:10.830
<v Speaker 1>so angry will show up against them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It by default becomes US versus them.</v>

838
00:37:11.220 --> 00:37:15.150
<v Speaker 1>They go in their backroom,</v>
<v Speaker 1>crate their edx and announced the people</v>

839
00:37:15.630 --> 00:37:18.360
<v Speaker 1>and we have local tyrants,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but more importantly,</v>

840
00:37:18.540 --> 00:37:23.540
<v Speaker 1>how do I can think that in my county </v>
<v Speaker 1>when I have to buy all these things as </v>

841
00:37:23.540 --> 00:37:25.890
<v Speaker 1>mandated by the state and by the federal</v>
<v Speaker 1>government had to raise money somehow.</v>

842
00:37:26.220 --> 00:37:28.200
<v Speaker 1>Only two ways.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a loophole in the old state.</v>

843
00:37:28.201 --> 00:37:30.090
<v Speaker 1>When it comes to property taxes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>every.</v>

844
00:37:30.091 --> 00:37:32.340
<v Speaker 1>The tax has to be voted on by the </v>
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>

845
00:37:32.580 --> 00:37:33.570
<v Speaker 1>Property tax?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

846
00:37:33.600 --> 00:37:37.830
<v Speaker 1>only by the council.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So officially our governor will tell you</v>

847
00:37:37.860 --> 00:37:39.780
<v Speaker 1>there's a two percent cap in property </v>
<v Speaker 1>tax,</v>

848
00:37:40.110 --> 00:37:42.450
<v Speaker 1>but there's an exception if it's an </v>
<v Speaker 1>emergency.</v>

849
00:37:43.470 --> 00:37:48.470
<v Speaker 1>So they go behind closed doors,</v>
<v Speaker 1>declared emergency and raise property </v>

850
00:37:48.470 --> 00:37:48.470
<v Speaker 1>taxes nine percent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do they count as an emergency?</v>

851
00:37:48.470 --> 00:37:49.680
<v Speaker 1>I need money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We on the money,</v>

852
00:37:49.980 --> 00:37:51.690
<v Speaker 1>the unfunded mandates go past our </v>
<v Speaker 1>budget.</v>

853
00:37:52.400 --> 00:37:55.980
<v Speaker 1>So two choices.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Option one is that property taxes option</v>

854
00:37:55.981 --> 00:37:58.140
<v Speaker 1>to use law enforcement as a profit </v>
<v Speaker 1>center.</v>

855
00:37:59.400 --> 00:38:04.400
<v Speaker 1>So now that parking thing that was 100 </v>
<v Speaker 1>bucks is out there in a bucks speeding </v>

856
00:38:04.400 --> 00:38:05.100
<v Speaker 1>ticket.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was 50 bucks is now 500 bucks.</v>

857
00:38:05.310 --> 00:38:07.290
<v Speaker 1>It's so bad that a lot of places in New </v>
<v Speaker 1>York state,</v>

858
00:38:07.860 --> 00:38:10.950
<v Speaker 1>they don't even want you to come to </v>
<v Speaker 1>court anymore,</v>

859
00:38:11.580 --> 00:38:16.580
<v Speaker 1>so when you get a bunch of tickets they </v>
<v Speaker 1>asked just sell the tickets off to </v>

860
00:38:16.580 --> 00:38:20.391
<v Speaker 1>collect agency,</v>
<v Speaker 1>get thirty cents of a dollar and </v>

861
00:38:20.391 --> 00:38:23.511
<v Speaker 1>everyone your credit because they don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>wanna waste your time to bring you in </v>

862
00:38:23.511 --> 00:38:23.511
<v Speaker 1>for court because you might not be able </v>
<v Speaker 1>to pick.</v>

863
00:38:23.511 --> 00:38:24.030
<v Speaker 1>They don't care if you pay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

864
00:38:24.390 --> 00:38:29.390
<v Speaker 1>they're actually getting the money from </v>
<v Speaker 1>the collect agency so they get a bunch </v>

865
00:38:29.390 --> 00:38:29.390
<v Speaker 1>of tickets.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Collect agency gets it.</v>

866
00:38:29.550 --> 00:38:34.550
<v Speaker 1>You,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you go to court whenever you want with </v>

867
00:38:34.550 --> 00:38:34.550
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>

868
00:38:34.550 --> 00:38:37.430
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So hearing everything you just said </v>

869
00:38:37.430 --> 00:38:37.430
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's like one</v>

870
00:38:37.430 --> 00:38:37.810
<v Speaker 2>of those things you that it makes so </v>
<v Speaker 2>much sense.</v>

871
00:38:37.811 --> 00:38:41.440
<v Speaker 2>It shows what the glut is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the middle management,</v>

872
00:38:41.530 --> 00:38:44.500
<v Speaker 2>corruption and greed and all that stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not even close to that.</v>

873
00:38:44.780 --> 00:38:45.100
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

874
00:38:45.110 --> 00:38:46.600
<v Speaker 2>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

875
00:38:46.630 --> 00:38:49.150
<v Speaker 2>let's just pause for one second though </v>
<v Speaker 2>because because as you're saying it,</v>

876
00:38:49.151 --> 00:38:50.470
<v Speaker 2>I'm thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

877
00:38:50.471 --> 00:38:55.471
<v Speaker 2>this is the type of stuff that I think </v>
<v Speaker 2>if people really understood they would </v>

878
00:38:55.471 --> 00:38:59.460
<v Speaker 2>be pissed about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's like one of those things that </v>

879
00:38:59.460 --> 00:39:00.130
<v Speaker 2>as a candidate explaining this to people</v>
<v Speaker 2>and getting people to be like,</v>

880
00:39:00.131 --> 00:39:02.220
<v Speaker 2>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it is the backdoor deals.</v>

881
00:39:03.330 --> 00:39:08.330
<v Speaker 2>This is like one of those issues where </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not easy to put the bumper sticker </v>

882
00:39:08.330 --> 00:39:09.400
<v Speaker 2>on and get people to get excited about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not,</v>

883
00:39:09.460 --> 00:39:10.920
<v Speaker 2>I need to build that wall and whatever </v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

884
00:39:11.180 --> 00:39:11.890
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>

885
00:39:11.891 --> 00:39:13.570
<v Speaker 2>Now to build that wall that he dot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

886
00:39:13.571 --> 00:39:14.430
<v Speaker 2>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

887
00:39:14.750 --> 00:39:19.750
<v Speaker 1>so pop music.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I knew New York and saved main street </v>

888
00:39:19.750 --> 00:39:23.260
<v Speaker 1>had been working pretty well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had a couple of those sayings was </v>

889
00:39:23.260 --> 00:39:23.260
<v Speaker 1>saying which one actually lands.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're using those right now.</v>

890
00:39:23.260 --> 00:39:23.860
<v Speaker 1>Seeing how they work,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but yeah,</v>

891
00:39:23.861 --> 00:39:25.930
<v Speaker 1>I mean this is a big problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of course people don't show up.</v>

892
00:39:25.931 --> 00:39:26.680
<v Speaker 1>Of course you will.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't vote.</v>

893
00:39:27.040 --> 00:39:28.780
<v Speaker 1>I think changes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

894
00:39:28.781 --> 00:39:33.781
<v Speaker 1>But here's another problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have counties where you have one </v>

895
00:39:33.781 --> 00:39:36.331
<v Speaker 1>third of the population of Medicaid,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one third of Medicare and the dwindling </v>

896
00:39:36.331 --> 00:39:37.390
<v Speaker 1>population.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The tax burden going up,</v>

897
00:39:37.880 --> 00:39:40.780
<v Speaker 1>New York state has a budget of about </v>
<v Speaker 1>$170,000,000,000</v>

898
00:39:41.010 --> 00:39:44.130
<v Speaker 1>and compared to California,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure the title however I'm going to.</v>

899
00:39:44.190 --> 00:39:49.190
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to compare that to other </v>

900
00:39:49.190 --> 00:39:49.190
<v Speaker 1>state.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Florida,</v>

901
00:39:49.190 --> 00:39:51.100
<v Speaker 1>Florida has more people than us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Half the budget now.</v>

902
00:39:51.101 --> 00:39:52.910
<v Speaker 1>The argument I always get is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but lowery,</v>

903
00:39:52.980 --> 00:39:55.150
<v Speaker 1>New York is expect or something on a </v>
<v Speaker 1>services.</v>

904
00:39:55.450 --> 00:39:58.720
<v Speaker 1>Then why a hundred thousand $100 leaving</v>
<v Speaker 1>every year and half of them are going to</v>

905
00:39:58.721 --> 00:40:03.721
<v Speaker 1>Florida.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So many New Yorkers are leaving our </v>

906
00:40:03.721 --> 00:40:03.880
<v Speaker 1>state that in the Carolinas they have a </v>
<v Speaker 1>name for us.</v>

907
00:40:04.260 --> 00:40:06.940
<v Speaker 1>They call us halfbacks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Florida and halfway back,</v>

908
00:40:07.680 --> 00:40:09.270
<v Speaker 1>so we're going to Carolina as we'll call</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

909
00:40:09.280 --> 00:40:11.890
<v Speaker 1>half bath.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's how common it is.</v>

910
00:40:11.891 --> 00:40:14.320
<v Speaker 1>Now we're running ever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Every time I do an event,</v>

911
00:40:14.410 --> 00:40:16.390
<v Speaker 1>I asked two questions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Question number one.</v>

912
00:40:16.480 --> 00:40:21.480
<v Speaker 1>I say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how many people here I think about </v>

913
00:40:21.480 --> 00:40:21.480
<v Speaker 1>leaving New York hands always go up and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they look around like,</v>

914
00:40:21.480 --> 00:40:22.090
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was only one.</v>

915
00:40:22.350 --> 00:40:25.690
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>half the room in every place I go.</v>

916
00:40:25.691 --> 00:40:27.430
<v Speaker 1>I go to a college,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I go to a diner,</v>

917
00:40:27.610 --> 00:40:29.800
<v Speaker 1>I go to a Vfw,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is matter where I go,</v>

918
00:40:29.830 --> 00:40:32.230
<v Speaker 1>I go to American Legion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I go someplace,</v>

919
00:40:32.380 --> 00:40:37.380
<v Speaker 1>boom.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Half the hands go up there all ready to </v>

920
00:40:37.380 --> 00:40:40.321
<v Speaker 1>leave.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Most of them us somehow trap trap </v>

921
00:40:40.321 --> 00:40:40.321
<v Speaker 1>because of kids shot because of job </v>
<v Speaker 1>traffic,</v>

922
00:40:40.321 --> 00:40:42.010
<v Speaker 1>because their properties in the water,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're trapped,</v>

923
00:40:42.520 --> 00:40:44.050
<v Speaker 1>but as soon as they can get that next </v>
<v Speaker 1>level,</v>

924
00:40:44.470 --> 00:40:45.550
<v Speaker 1>they are gone.</v>

925
00:40:46.060 --> 00:40:47.380
<v Speaker 1>Huge problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Secondly,</v>

926
00:40:47.381 --> 00:40:52.381
<v Speaker 1>I asked all the time is how many of you </v>
<v Speaker 1>have not voted in the past two election </v>

927
00:40:52.381 --> 00:40:54.070
<v Speaker 1>cycles and those go up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What does that mean?</v>

928
00:40:54.071 --> 00:40:59.071
<v Speaker 1>It means I'm drawing the people in </v>
<v Speaker 1>because I'm worried about the most </v>

929
00:40:59.071 --> 00:41:01.030
<v Speaker 1>important piece here and that is about </v>
<v Speaker 1>impact what you do.</v>

930
00:41:01.420 --> 00:41:04.120
<v Speaker 1>How do I win this thing?</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is a winnable race.</v>

931
00:41:04.870 --> 00:41:06.430
<v Speaker 1>Six months ago I wouldn't have said </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

932
00:41:06.670 --> 00:41:09.490
<v Speaker 1>Now I know there's at least a four </v>
<v Speaker 1>person race.</v>

933
00:41:09.730 --> 00:41:11.300
<v Speaker 1>It's going to be his majesty,</v>
<v Speaker 1>King Cuomo.</v>

934
00:41:11.460 --> 00:41:13.900
<v Speaker 1>He will be running for sure the </v>
<v Speaker 1>communists.</v>

935
00:41:13.901 --> 00:41:16.690
<v Speaker 1>How Hok is room for the winning party,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the sacrificial lamb.</v>

936
00:41:16.691 --> 00:41:19.210
<v Speaker 1>We're run by Republicans who cannot win,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just fighting for second place.</v>

937
00:41:19.280 --> 00:41:23.490
<v Speaker 1>Who is Manara?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's a downstate Republican.</v>

938
00:41:23.770 --> 00:41:27.670
<v Speaker 1>They pick two downstate republicans to </v>
<v Speaker 1>run for governor and the governor.</v>

939
00:41:27.790 --> 00:41:30.450
<v Speaker 1>Clearly they surrendered.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's just get as much as we can.</v>

940
00:41:30.490 --> 00:41:35.490
<v Speaker 1>New York City and try to get second </v>
<v Speaker 1>place they've surrendered and then at </v>

941
00:41:35.490 --> 00:41:35.490
<v Speaker 1>least four.</v>

942
00:41:35.490 --> 00:41:36.700
<v Speaker 1>It's possible the act from sex and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>city.</v>

943
00:41:36.720 --> 00:41:38.030
<v Speaker 1>Nixon will stay in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe.</v>

944
00:41:38.031 --> 00:41:39.930
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if she will after she loses</v>
<v Speaker 1>to a.</v>

945
00:41:39.980 --> 00:41:41.030
<v Speaker 1>She may stay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I may not.</v>

946
00:41:41.031 --> 00:41:46.031
<v Speaker 1>So two maybe and then maybe someone else</v>
<v Speaker 1>a minor out of Syracuse may not as </v>

947
00:41:46.031 --> 00:41:46.340
<v Speaker 1>independent as possible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I could have six,</v>

948
00:41:46.341 --> 00:41:50.660
<v Speaker 1>but at least for New York state's a </v>
<v Speaker 1>plurality state means all I need is more</v>

949
00:41:50.661 --> 00:41:53.630
<v Speaker 1>than the rest.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are about $18 million.</v>

950
00:41:53.631 --> 00:41:56.540
<v Speaker 1>19 million New Yorkers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>About 12 men that are eligible to vote.</v>

951
00:41:56.960 --> 00:42:01.340
<v Speaker 1>Only about four to 5 million every vote.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One point 5 million votes.</v>

952
00:42:01.580 --> 00:42:03.260
<v Speaker 1>And the governor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thirty percent.</v>

953
00:42:03.540 --> 00:42:04.760
<v Speaker 1>I'm the governor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Larry.</v>

954
00:42:04.761 --> 00:42:05.900
<v Speaker 1>That's huge.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is.</v>

955
00:42:05.901 --> 00:42:07.910
<v Speaker 1>But Gary,</v>
<v Speaker 1>John's got a 175,000</v>

956
00:42:07.911 --> 00:42:11.210
<v Speaker 1>votes in my state in 2016.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was there for five minutes.</v>

957
00:42:11.780 --> 00:42:13.820
<v Speaker 1>He showed up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>waved and walked away,</v>

958
00:42:13.940 --> 00:42:16.340
<v Speaker 1>and it was 175,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>people who said,</v>

959
00:42:16.341 --> 00:42:18.590
<v Speaker 1>I'm so sick and tired out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>vote for Gary Johnson.</v>

960
00:42:18.590 --> 00:42:19.340
<v Speaker 1>I'll do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll do it.</v>

961
00:42:19.400 --> 00:42:21.860
<v Speaker 1>I'll do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I live in this state.</v>

962
00:42:22.040 --> 00:42:27.040
<v Speaker 1>I campaign the state.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've raised more money than everyone </v>

963
00:42:27.040 --> 00:42:29.830
<v Speaker 1>except for the governor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You tell me I can't get 10 times that </v>

964
00:42:29.830 --> 00:42:31.100
<v Speaker 1>five times that even.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of course I can,</v>

965
00:42:31.490 --> 00:42:36.490
<v Speaker 1>but more importantly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have three other people have to get </v>

966
00:42:36.490 --> 00:42:36.490
<v Speaker 1>three types.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Number one,</v>

967
00:42:36.490 --> 00:42:36.490
<v Speaker 1>unhappy Democrats,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Republicans,</v>

968
00:42:36.710 --> 00:42:41.710
<v Speaker 1>tons of them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they're not my number one because </v>

969
00:42:41.710 --> 00:42:44.150
<v Speaker 1>many of them will still go back to old </v>
<v Speaker 1>ways because most people who vote often,</v>

970
00:42:44.390 --> 00:42:47.000
<v Speaker 1>usually both because of fear not because</v>
<v Speaker 1>of hope.</v>

971
00:42:47.930 --> 00:42:50.240
<v Speaker 1>This little free,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the other guy might win that.</v>

972
00:42:50.241 --> 00:42:51.830
<v Speaker 1>Most of them was going to go back </v>
<v Speaker 1>through old ways.</v>

973
00:42:51.920 --> 00:42:56.920
<v Speaker 1>I get that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but some of them won't take whatever I </v>

974
00:42:56.920 --> 00:42:58.381
<v Speaker 1>can yet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the next one is the single issue </v>

975
00:42:58.381 --> 00:42:58.381
<v Speaker 1>voter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The person who cares,</v>

976
00:42:58.381 --> 00:43:00.830
<v Speaker 1>but only one thing and one thing only.</v>

977
00:43:01.040 --> 00:43:03.470
<v Speaker 1>I bring up many of these issues of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>vaping industry,</v>

978
00:43:03.800 --> 00:43:06.020
<v Speaker 1>right in New York state is trying to </v>
<v Speaker 1>crush the vaping industry.</v>

979
00:43:06.021 --> 00:43:08.930
<v Speaker 1>I don't know why they can't stand it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Trying to destroy the vaping industry.</v>

980
00:43:09.200 --> 00:43:10.220
<v Speaker 1>Silly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why would you?</v>

981
00:43:10.610 --> 00:43:11.630
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're a vaper,</v>

982
00:43:12.140 --> 00:43:13.270
<v Speaker 1>that's important.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have your own.</v>

983
00:43:13.271 --> 00:43:14.990
<v Speaker 1>If you own a vape shop,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's your livelihood.</v>

984
00:43:15.410 --> 00:43:20.410
<v Speaker 1>I could be saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to support the industry and a </v>

985
00:43:20.410 --> 00:43:20.410
<v Speaker 1>kick puppies in the streets filed with </v>
<v Speaker 1>the public thing.</v>

986
00:43:20.410 --> 00:43:25.270
<v Speaker 1>Just really care about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's all so issues like that,</v>

987
00:43:25.340 --> 00:43:27.290
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

988
00:43:27.350 --> 00:43:30.650
<v Speaker 1>people have been crushed by family law,</v>
<v Speaker 1>have an entire policy for fixing.</v>

989
00:43:30.651 --> 00:43:33.740
<v Speaker 1>The family court system has been </v>
<v Speaker 1>completely revamped their fathers,</v>

990
00:43:33.741 --> 00:43:38.210
<v Speaker 1>at least a million who've been crushed </v>
<v Speaker 1>and destroyed by the family court system</v>

991
00:43:38.211 --> 00:43:39.500
<v Speaker 1>in New York state.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean just devastated.</v>

<v Speaker 1>I will fix that.</v>

995
00:43:46.791 --> 00:43:51.791
<v Speaker 1>In Law.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm the only ones supporting the </v>

996

<v Speaker 1>industry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The only to my family law.</v>

997
00:43:51.791 --> 00:43:52.250
<v Speaker 1>These people vote for me because that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>what they care about.</v>

998
00:43:52.700 --> 00:43:54.620
<v Speaker 1>People who in New York state who've </v>
<v Speaker 1>gotten Duis,</v>

999
00:43:54.680 --> 00:43:58.160
<v Speaker 1>three of us are more and they lose their</v>
<v Speaker 1>license in perpetuity,</v>

1000
00:43:58.161 --> 00:44:03.161
<v Speaker 1>no matter what.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are some people who've paid the </v>

1001

<v Speaker 1>time in jail,</v>
<v Speaker 1>done role,</v>

<v Speaker 1>you've paid your time in jail,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you brought your license back,</v>

1005
00:44:12.570 --> 00:44:17.570
<v Speaker 1>and if they leave New York state,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then the state won't get my license </v>

1006
00:44:17.570 --> 00:44:18.230
<v Speaker 1>because it was revoked.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They may never drive again.</v>

1007
00:44:18.500 --> 00:44:23.500
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not giving them a chance to be a </v>

1008
00:44:23.500 --> 00:44:23.500
<v Speaker 1>functioning member.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They can't.</v>

1009
00:44:23.500 --> 00:44:23.540
<v Speaker 1>That has to go and people say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but lottery,</v>

1010
00:44:23.541 --> 00:44:24.650
<v Speaker 1>why would you support these industries?</v>

1011
00:44:24.710 --> 00:44:26.270
<v Speaker 1>We're number one of these issues.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>

1012
00:44:26.450 --> 00:44:27.650
<v Speaker 1>It's right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a libertarian.</v>

1013
00:44:28.400 --> 00:44:30.470
<v Speaker 1>That's what we do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I am righteous.</v>

1014
00:44:30.471 --> 00:44:32.640
<v Speaker 1>Of course I libertarians always,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's the thing,</v>

1015
00:44:32.641 --> 00:44:33.480
<v Speaker 1>most of them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they'll get.</v>

1016
00:44:33.780 --> 00:44:35.880
<v Speaker 1>Libertarians always have the moral high </v>
<v Speaker 1>ground.</v>

1017
00:44:36.000 --> 00:44:39.450
<v Speaker 1>Always the act like we don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we always do.</v>

1018
00:44:39.870 --> 00:44:41.970
<v Speaker 1>I know that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I take the moral high ground.</v>

1019
00:44:41.971 --> 00:44:42.750
<v Speaker 1>It's mine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I own it,</v>

1020
00:44:42.960 --> 00:44:47.960
<v Speaker 1>so I take it and it's right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm in the pocket of big Dui pocket.</v>

1021
00:44:49.590 --> 00:44:52.800
<v Speaker 1>Of course not right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It shows people that I care,</v>

1022
00:44:52.801 --> 00:44:57.801
<v Speaker 1>that it makes sense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they know that when I get into </v>

1023
00:44:57.801 --> 00:44:57.801
<v Speaker 1>power,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm still going to support his people.</v>

1024
00:44:57.801 --> 00:44:57.930
<v Speaker 1>I'm not going.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not in it for the money.</v>

1025
00:44:58.650 --> 00:45:03.650
<v Speaker 1>These people vote tons of these issues.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They will jump on board and they will </v>

1026
00:45:03.650 --> 00:45:03.650
<v Speaker 1>vote,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but more than that,</v>

1027
00:45:03.650 --> 00:45:05.820
<v Speaker 1>there are 8 million New Yorkers who </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't vote.</v>

1028
00:45:06.690 --> 00:45:07.980
<v Speaker 1>They vote because of hope.</v>

1029
00:45:08.730 --> 00:45:10.530
<v Speaker 1>Bernie taught us this and trump told us </v>
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>

1030
00:45:10.800 --> 00:45:12.180
<v Speaker 1>Trump gave,</v>
<v Speaker 1>gave the right hope.</v>

1031
00:45:12.450 --> 00:45:14.040
<v Speaker 1>Bernie gave the left hope.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

1032
00:45:14.041 --> 00:45:15.690
<v Speaker 1>if the Democratic Party wasn't so </v>
<v Speaker 1>broken,</v>

1033
00:45:15.900 --> 00:45:20.900
<v Speaker 1>Bernie would have been the nominee and </v>
<v Speaker 1>it would've been hope versus hope and </v>

1034
00:45:20.900 --> 00:45:20.900
<v Speaker 1>hope.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One,</v>

1035
00:45:20.900 --> 00:45:22.860
<v Speaker 1>I think you've been corrupt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

1036
00:45:22.890 --> 00:45:25.420
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if it's broken or corrupt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was intentional.</v>

1037
00:45:25.760 --> 00:45:29.040
<v Speaker 1>They were both either,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it would have been hope versus hope.</v>

1038
00:45:29.190 --> 00:45:34.190
<v Speaker 1>Hope one hope gets people out of their </v>
<v Speaker 1>bed and stopped playing video games and </v>

1039
00:45:34.190 --> 00:45:34.980
<v Speaker 1>show up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How do you make that happen?</v>

1040
00:45:34.981 --> 00:45:37.260
<v Speaker 1>By having events,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm doing events all the time.</v>

1041
00:45:37.440 --> 00:45:40.110
<v Speaker 1>People are showing up to my events who </v>
<v Speaker 1>didn't vote,</v>

1042
00:45:40.140 --> 00:45:43.970
<v Speaker 1>which means they will show up at the </v>
<v Speaker 1>polling booth trumpet.</v>

1043
00:45:44.130 --> 00:45:45.750
<v Speaker 1>Brian told us this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm copying.</v>

1044
00:45:45.751 --> 00:45:47.040
<v Speaker 1>Then it's working.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>

1045
00:45:47.041 --> 00:45:49.170
<v Speaker 1>look what got you here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean your guys.</v>

1046
00:45:49.260 --> 00:45:51.240
<v Speaker 1>I started seeing it more and more and </v>
<v Speaker 1>more on twitter.</v>

1047
00:45:51.240 --> 00:45:53.220
<v Speaker 1>Next thing I know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think you tweeted at me or one of your</v>

1048
00:45:53.221 --> 00:45:55.080
<v Speaker 1>guys tweeted at me and we made it </v>
<v Speaker 1>happen.</v>

1049
00:45:55.110 --> 00:45:57.420
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>

1050
00:45:57.980 --> 00:45:59.280
<v Speaker 1>but here's the next four pieces.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now.</v>

1051
00:45:59.340 --> 00:46:01.620
<v Speaker 1>Now if I just get 10 percent of the 8 </v>
<v Speaker 1>million,</v>

1052
00:46:01.950 --> 00:46:04.110
<v Speaker 1>800,000,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm halfway there.</v>

1053
00:46:04.410 --> 00:46:05.250
<v Speaker 1>Tell us what.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll pick up.</v>

1054
00:46:05.340 --> 00:46:06.840
<v Speaker 1>I'm the governor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I get 20 percent.</v>

1055
00:46:07.050 --> 00:46:09.480
<v Speaker 1>It's a blowout.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is a winnable race.</v>

1056
00:46:10.000 --> 00:46:13.350
<v Speaker 1>There were four arenas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anyone that has to win on to get elected</v>

1057
00:46:13.410 --> 00:46:15.480
<v Speaker 1>for first one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>social media.</v>

1058
00:46:15.990 --> 00:46:20.990
<v Speaker 1>Six months ago I would have thought I </v>
<v Speaker 1>could never win because Cuomo has so </v>

1059
00:46:20.990 --> 00:46:20.990
<v Speaker 1>much more money than I have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1060
00:46:20.990 --> 00:46:21.000
<v Speaker 1>I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no way I could win,</v>

1061
00:46:21.210 --> 00:46:22.620
<v Speaker 1>but he.</v>
<v Speaker 1>His social media isn't competent.</v>

1062
00:46:23.070 --> 00:46:25.560
<v Speaker 1>We are winning on social media that is </v>
<v Speaker 1>on mobile and this is proof of it.</v>

1063
00:46:25.660 --> 00:46:28.170
<v Speaker 1>We are killing it in social media.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We are winning hands down,</v>

1064
00:46:28.560 --> 00:46:29.400
<v Speaker 1>but that's just one.</v>

1065
00:46:29.850 --> 00:46:32.380
<v Speaker 1>The second one is traditional media.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This one I struggle in.</v>

1066
00:46:32.800 --> 00:46:35.100
<v Speaker 1>Tourism is tough for me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They go for the popular.</v>

1067
00:46:35.101 --> 00:46:37.170
<v Speaker 1>Cynthia Nixon was popular or the </v>
<v Speaker 1>governor.</v>

1068
00:46:37.410 --> 00:46:42.410
<v Speaker 1>They go with the tried and true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's hard to get it and then I live in </v>

1069
00:46:42.410 --> 00:46:42.410
<v Speaker 1>New York City,</v>
<v Speaker 1>New York City.</v>

1070
00:46:42.410 --> 00:46:44.220
<v Speaker 1>Something's always going on Tuskegee </v>
<v Speaker 1>coverage,</v>

1071
00:46:44.320 --> 00:46:47.820
<v Speaker 1>so the to get round that I'd be going </v>
<v Speaker 1>upstate western New York.</v>

1072
00:46:47.821 --> 00:46:50.070
<v Speaker 1>Smaller towns where that to Joyce's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1073
00:46:50.130 --> 00:46:55.130
<v Speaker 1>Some some guy lost his cow or not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was coming to town shower,</v>

1074
00:46:56.400 --> 00:46:58.560
<v Speaker 1>so I've been doing that so I get a lot </v>
<v Speaker 1>of local media,</v>

1075
00:46:58.561 --> 00:47:01.830
<v Speaker 1>but I've also learned that local media </v>
<v Speaker 1>also often overlaps.</v>

1076
00:47:02.700 --> 00:47:07.700
<v Speaker 1>They also have social media presence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some of the writers are shared among </v>

1077
00:47:07.700 --> 00:47:10.851
<v Speaker 1>different papers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I'm getting a lot of press in the </v>

1078
00:47:10.851 --> 00:47:11.010
<v Speaker 1>local paper,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I'm doing better traditional media.</v>

1079
00:47:11.310 --> 00:47:12.660
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if I can actually win it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe,</v>

1080
00:47:12.661 --> 00:47:13.680
<v Speaker 1>maybe not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's one.</v>

1081
00:47:13.680 --> 00:47:18.680
<v Speaker 1>That's one issue that I'm fighting on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm trying new tactics to win on that </v>

1082
00:47:18.680 --> 00:47:18.680
<v Speaker 1>one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The next one's events,</v>

1083
00:47:18.680 --> 00:47:20.790
<v Speaker 1>as I talked about right now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no one else is doing events.</v>

1084
00:47:21.060 --> 00:47:26.060
<v Speaker 1>I'm the only one doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm the only one out shaking hands and </v>

1085
00:47:26.060 --> 00:47:29.091
<v Speaker 1>kissing babies and meeting people and </v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm winning events like there's no </v>

1086
00:47:29.091 --> 00:47:29.091
<v Speaker 1>tomorrow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm winning an events.</v>

1087
00:47:29.091 --> 00:47:33.891
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The issue is they will eventually begin </v>

1088
00:47:33.891 --> 00:47:36.061
<v Speaker 1>doing events when they do will I will.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have ramped up to speed or not some </v>

1089
00:47:36.131 --> 00:47:39.160
<v Speaker 1>questionable on those two.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The last one's debates.</v>

1090
00:47:39.460 --> 00:47:41.770
<v Speaker 1>If you see me debate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have no problem debating.</v>

1091
00:47:41.920 --> 00:47:44.230
<v Speaker 1>I will crush them on debates,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I will.</v>

1092
00:47:44.231 --> 00:47:47.500
<v Speaker 1>When social media and debates.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The question is can I,</v>

1093
00:47:47.501 --> 00:47:51.610
<v Speaker 1>when traditional media and our events,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I win three out of four,</v>

1094
00:47:51.730 --> 00:47:52.750
<v Speaker 1>I'm the governor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now.</v>

1095
00:47:52.751 --> 00:47:57.751
<v Speaker 1>You said you said a key if there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which was if you debate what's the </v>

1096
00:47:57.751 --> 00:48:02.521
<v Speaker 1>debate situation for the rebates because</v>
<v Speaker 1>traditionally for always in the dates </v>

1097
00:48:02.770 --> 00:48:07.770
<v Speaker 1>they were in 2014,</v>
<v Speaker 1>2010 traditionally are to be </v>

1098
00:48:07.770 --> 00:48:07.770
<v Speaker 1>Libertarian,</v>
<v Speaker 1>green,</v>

1099
00:48:07.770 --> 00:48:07.770
<v Speaker 1>Democrat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Republican,</v>

1100
00:48:07.770 --> 00:48:12.540
<v Speaker 1>so odds are debates as a very high and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they keep you in the debate regardless </v>

1101
00:48:12.540 --> 00:48:12.540
<v Speaker 1>of polling.</v>

1102
00:48:12.540 --> 00:48:13.500
<v Speaker 1>After that one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>once I ran,</v>

1103
00:48:13.510 --> 00:48:18.510
<v Speaker 1>it's for all the way across,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they probably only do one to two or </v>

1104
00:48:18.510 --> 00:48:18.510
<v Speaker 1>three,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but who wanted to be the only.</v>

1105
00:48:18.510 --> 00:48:22.620
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the debate in October one and </v>

1106
00:48:22.620 --> 00:48:22.620
<v Speaker 1>October.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's all man.</v>

1107
00:48:22.620 --> 00:48:22.870
<v Speaker 1>So that's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's like the show up.</v>

1108
00:48:23.020 --> 00:48:24.490
<v Speaker 1>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Win,</v>

1109
00:48:24.491 --> 00:48:25.700
<v Speaker 1>lose or draw right there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1110
00:48:26.020 --> 00:48:26.800
<v Speaker 1>I don't mind it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I liked it.</v>

1111
00:48:26.801 --> 00:48:27.670
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that is a good odds.</v>

1112
00:48:28.060 --> 00:48:30.130
<v Speaker 1>What kind of support are you getting </v>
<v Speaker 1>from the party itself?</v>

1113
00:48:30.910 --> 00:48:31.660
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was good as it can be.</v>

1114
00:48:31.661 --> 00:48:32.170
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

1115
00:48:32.171 --> 00:48:37.171
<v Speaker 1>it's New York State Libertarians.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There aren't that many of them to small </v>

1116
00:48:37.171 --> 00:48:37.171
<v Speaker 1>party.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

1117
00:48:37.171 --> 00:48:37.390
<v Speaker 1>there are city,</v>
<v Speaker 1>two counties in New York.</v>

1118
00:48:37.391 --> 00:48:42.391
<v Speaker 1>We have about 20 affiliates,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so we have 42 counties that didn't have </v>

1119
00:48:42.391 --> 00:48:42.391
<v Speaker 1>affiliates.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's,</v>

1120
00:48:42.391 --> 00:48:44.380
<v Speaker 1>it's not a powerful party to across the </v>
<v Speaker 1>state.</v>

1121
00:48:44.381 --> 00:48:46.660
<v Speaker 1>We not even officially a party were </v>
<v Speaker 1>officially a committee.</v>

1122
00:48:47.240 --> 00:48:47.640
<v Speaker 1>What do you mean?</v>

1123
00:48:47.650 --> 00:48:48.380
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I,</v>

1124
00:48:48.381 --> 00:48:48.760
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

1125
00:48:48.790 --> 00:48:50.590
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the parties autonomous at behind me.</v>

1126
00:48:50.591 --> 00:48:53.290
<v Speaker 1>One hundred percent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There isn't that much there.</v>

1127
00:48:53.320 --> 00:48:54.550
<v Speaker 1>What they can do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they are doing.</v>

1128
00:48:54.551 --> 00:48:57.880
<v Speaker 1>I'm very happy with what they're doing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wish I'd had a party.</v>

1129
00:48:58.030 --> 00:48:59.380
<v Speaker 1>I wish had more bodies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do.</v>

1130
00:48:59.381 --> 00:49:04.381
<v Speaker 1>I wish I had more bodies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but luckily getting there we are and </v>

1131
00:49:04.381 --> 00:49:04.381
<v Speaker 1>we're getting more people from other </v>
<v Speaker 1>states are coming.</v>

1132
00:49:04.381 --> 00:49:08.251
<v Speaker 1>Also other people are joining and for </v>
<v Speaker 1>the first time now people are coming to </v>

1133
00:49:09.131 --> 00:49:11.230
<v Speaker 1>the party because of me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

1134
00:49:11.260 --> 00:49:14.650
<v Speaker 1>Most people who join me before came to </v>
<v Speaker 1>the party because of someone else.</v>

1135
00:49:14.920 --> 00:49:15.580
<v Speaker 1>Ron,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Paul,</v>

1136
00:49:15.581 --> 00:49:17.110
<v Speaker 1>Gary Johnson,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Harry Brown,</v>

1137
00:49:17.350 --> 00:49:19.090
<v Speaker 1>and then so my candidacy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I jumped on board,</v>

1138
00:49:19.720 --> 00:49:22.180
<v Speaker 1>but now that I've been so active for so </v>
<v Speaker 1>many months in New York state,</v>

1139
00:49:22.270 --> 00:49:24.220
<v Speaker 1>some people not coming to partly because</v>
<v Speaker 1>of me.</v>

1140
00:49:24.490 --> 00:49:27.370
<v Speaker 1>Those people are now building up our </v>
<v Speaker 1>group of,</v>

1141
00:49:27.460 --> 00:49:28.390
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of uh,</v>

1142
00:49:28.690 --> 00:49:29.530
<v Speaker 1>of activists.</v>

1143
00:49:29.560 --> 00:49:34.560
<v Speaker 1>So I am getting more and more again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what I'm getting from the people is </v>

1144
00:49:34.560 --> 00:49:34.840
<v Speaker 1>amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do more of them though.</v>

1145
00:49:34.990 --> 00:49:39.990
<v Speaker 1>So we are getting there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you sense that there is a rebirth of </v>

1146
00:49:39.990 --> 00:49:40.930
<v Speaker 1>liberty in this country in general?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1147
00:49:40.931 --> 00:49:45.931
<v Speaker 1>I can tell from what I'm out now on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>road and touring and the response I get </v>

1148
00:49:45.931 --> 00:49:50.071
<v Speaker 1>to this show and the amount of emails I </v>
<v Speaker 1>get in twitter that people are talking </v>

1149
00:49:50.071 --> 00:49:50.290
<v Speaker 1>about liberty.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Again,</v>

1150
00:49:50.291 --> 00:49:52.330
<v Speaker 1>they're talking about it's not just the </v>
<v Speaker 1>tea party anymore.</v>

1151
00:49:52.331 --> 00:49:54.190
<v Speaker 1>Talking about liberty,</v>
<v Speaker 1>about liberty,</v>

1152
00:49:54.191 --> 00:49:57.130
<v Speaker 1>talking about freedom.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You talk about the founding documents.</v>

1153
00:49:57.370 --> 00:50:00.550
<v Speaker 1>People are actually reinvigorated about </v>
<v Speaker 1>this stuff.</v>

1154
00:50:00.580 --> 00:50:03.130
<v Speaker 1>What moves people is two things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One,</v>

1155
00:50:03.640 --> 00:50:08.620
<v Speaker 1>they feel like things are so broken and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then to someone gives them hope.</v>

1156
00:50:09.550 --> 00:50:11.440
<v Speaker 1>Revolutions as they say installed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was it built on?</v>

1157
00:50:11.441 --> 00:50:12.580
<v Speaker 1>Hope?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They are.</v>

1158
00:50:12.610 --> 00:50:13.360
<v Speaker 1>It's true,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1159
00:50:13.570 --> 00:50:15.340
<v Speaker 1>The,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Russians stayed,</v>

1160
00:50:15.400 --> 00:50:15.570
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>

1161
00:50:15.580 --> 00:50:17.320
<v Speaker 1>Three hundred years being oppressed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever it was,</v>

1162
00:50:17.321 --> 00:50:22.321
<v Speaker 1>foreign ears being oppressive as </v>
<v Speaker 1>peasants and serves and so there was </v>

1163
00:50:22.321 --> 00:50:24.871
<v Speaker 1>some hope.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then the communist gave them hope and </v>

1164
00:50:24.871 --> 00:50:24.871
<v Speaker 1>they revolted.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It has to be hope,</v>

1165
00:50:24.871 --> 00:50:29.460
<v Speaker 1>but it wasn't a communist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Countries might have been around for a </v>

1166
00:50:29.460 --> 00:50:29.460
<v Speaker 1>bit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was London,</v>

1167
00:50:29.460 --> 00:50:30.110
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was an individual.</v>

1168
00:50:30.980 --> 00:50:35.900
<v Speaker 1>People bring people to revolutions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People give other people hope.</v>

1169
00:50:36.230 --> 00:50:38.810
<v Speaker 1>We're finding better messengers now than</v>
<v Speaker 1>we've ever had.</v>

1170
00:50:39.770 --> 00:50:41.690
<v Speaker 1>It's not just rumble,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1171
00:50:41.750 --> 00:50:45.560
<v Speaker 1>It's a lot of us are doing this and I'm </v>
<v Speaker 1>hoping if you've seen my campaign,</v>

1172
00:50:45.740 --> 00:50:48.080
<v Speaker 1>I'm doing my best.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Half of my team is not in New York.</v>

1173
00:50:48.560 --> 00:50:52.070
<v Speaker 1>That's on purpose,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so a purpose because I want to make sure</v>

1174
00:50:52.071 --> 00:50:56.770
<v Speaker 1>that my [inaudible] seven directors and </v>
<v Speaker 1>about 50 active volunteers and about 200</v>

1175
00:50:56.771 --> 00:51:00.860
<v Speaker 1>and winks and I'm purposely doing that </v>
<v Speaker 1>because I want people to be able to grow</v>

1176
00:51:00.861 --> 00:51:04.970
<v Speaker 1>that infrastructure so that in 2020 we </v>
<v Speaker 1>have seven campaign managers,</v>

1177
00:51:05.930 --> 00:51:06.680
<v Speaker 1>active campaign.</v>

1178
00:51:06.710 --> 00:51:10.280
<v Speaker 1>We run a real campaign who not do things</v>
<v Speaker 1>like this who don't make things work.</v>

1179
00:51:10.380 --> 00:51:12.770
<v Speaker 1>The betrayal part is not happening.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Infrastructure we needed.</v>

1180
00:51:13.220 --> 00:51:18.220
<v Speaker 1>If we have better infrastructure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have more people like me who want to </v>

1181
00:51:18.220 --> 00:51:18.220
<v Speaker 1>do this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1182
00:51:18.220 --> 00:51:19.670
<v Speaker 1>People don't run because they have to </v>
<v Speaker 1>run by themselves.</v>

1183
00:51:20.000 --> 00:51:21.030
<v Speaker 1>So infrastructure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1184
00:51:21.560 --> 00:51:22.330
<v Speaker 1>but now I can say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1185
00:51:22.331 --> 00:51:23.420
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here's your team.</v>

1186
00:51:24.020 --> 00:51:29.020
<v Speaker 1>Better people will run and they'll run </v>
<v Speaker 1>better candidacies that run better </v>

1187
00:51:29.020 --> 00:51:29.960
<v Speaker 1>campaigns and when they do that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>more people will see them,</v>

1188
00:51:30.200 --> 00:51:32.780
<v Speaker 1>will be more people to the movement.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think there is a rise,</v>

1189
00:51:32.960 --> 00:51:34.280
<v Speaker 1>but it's because we're having better </v>
<v Speaker 1>candidates.</v>

1190
00:51:34.730 --> 00:51:36.860
<v Speaker 1>Are you tracking Austin Petersen out in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Missouri?</v>

1191
00:51:36.920 --> 00:51:38.930
<v Speaker 1>I'm a fan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he's been here.</v>

1192
00:51:38.970 --> 00:51:40.760
<v Speaker 1>We're friends.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think he's doing great work.</v>

1193
00:51:40.761 --> 00:51:42.920
<v Speaker 1>Last I saw a poll just in the last </v>
<v Speaker 1>couple of weeks.</v>

1194
00:51:42.921 --> 00:51:44.720
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it looks like he's beaming mccaskill.</v>

1195
00:51:44.800 --> 00:51:49.800
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that's one of the type of ones </v>

1196
00:51:49.800 --> 00:51:50.870
<v Speaker 1>and Ben potentially years as well that I</v>
<v Speaker 1>agree with you in that for sure.</v>

1197
00:51:51.080 --> 00:51:51.860
<v Speaker 1>That it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

1198
00:51:51.861 --> 00:51:55.640
<v Speaker 1>if one of these guys breakthrough,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just wish he put an elbow to his name.</v>

1199
00:51:56.510 --> 00:51:58.490
<v Speaker 1>So I think he had.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well I think he first,</v>

1200
00:51:58.500 --> 00:51:59.800
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he definitely is a libertarian.</v>

1201
00:51:59.820 --> 00:52:00.920
<v Speaker 1>There's no doubt about that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think,</v>

1202
00:52:00.921 --> 00:52:01.640
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a fan.</v>

1203
00:52:01.700 --> 00:52:03.140
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Doing forward.</v>

1204
00:52:03.141 --> 00:52:04.400
<v Speaker 1>I'm on record.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was,</v>

1205
00:52:04.630 --> 00:52:06.590
<v Speaker 1>I was probably the only guy on the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on the,</v>

1206
00:52:06.591 --> 00:52:11.591
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the living and leadership who said </v>

1207
00:52:11.591 --> 00:52:11.591
<v Speaker 1>please stay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I openly what I call them.</v>

1208
00:52:11.591 --> 00:52:11.840
<v Speaker 1>I want them to stay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wanted him to stay.</v>

1209
00:52:11.850 --> 00:52:13.250
<v Speaker 1>And what did,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what did he say to that?</v>

1210
00:52:13.410 --> 00:52:15.480
<v Speaker 1>Is it just real politic?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So Joseph,</v>

1211
00:52:15.530 --> 00:52:16.010
<v Speaker 1>he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

1212
00:52:16.011 --> 00:52:17.110
<v Speaker 1>everyone's telling me to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're like,</v>

1213
00:52:17.150 --> 00:52:19.030
<v Speaker 1>you're like one of the only guys telling</v>
<v Speaker 1>me to go libertarian.</v>

1214
00:52:19.090 --> 00:52:20.390
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was one of the only guy.</v>

1215
00:52:20.391 --> 00:52:22.040
<v Speaker 1>It's true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So at the end of the day,</v>

1216
00:52:22.041 --> 00:52:24.500
<v Speaker 1>I still want to be a libertarian,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but at the end of the day,</v>

1217
00:52:24.920 --> 00:52:26.000
<v Speaker 1>you still want them to win.</v>

1218
00:52:26.060 --> 00:52:27.730
<v Speaker 1>Of course.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Clearly,</v>

1219
00:52:27.790 --> 00:52:31.430
<v Speaker 1>yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Feel yes,</v>

1220
00:52:31.610 --> 00:52:32.530
<v Speaker 1>of course.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wanted to win.</v>

1221
00:52:32.540 --> 00:52:37.540
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When I'd rather have him on mccaskill </v>

1222
00:52:37.540 --> 00:52:37.540
<v Speaker 1>and Senate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not even close.</v>

1223
00:52:37.940 --> 00:52:39.500
<v Speaker 1>Not even close.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of course not.</v>

1224
00:52:39.560 --> 00:52:41.080
<v Speaker 1>Of course I wanna know what I.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm asking them.</v>

1225
00:52:41.090 --> 00:52:42.170
<v Speaker 1>Of course.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of course.</v>

1226
00:52:42.171 --> 00:52:43.130
<v Speaker 1>I want him to win.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

1227
00:52:43.280 --> 00:52:44.190
<v Speaker 1>I Miss Saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh God,</v>

1228
00:52:44.220 --> 00:52:45.830
<v Speaker 1>I'm selfish.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd rather them have nobody's name,</v>

1229
00:52:46.340 --> 00:52:47.250
<v Speaker 1>but I'll take him an hour.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1230
00:52:47.260 --> 00:52:48.110
<v Speaker 1>Saito.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll deal.</v>

1231
00:52:48.140 --> 00:52:53.140
<v Speaker 1>I'll deal with them in our LLC.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I'll tell you one of my fears about </v>

1232
00:52:53.140 --> 00:52:54.410
<v Speaker 1>what could potentially happen with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>libertarians because I do.</v>

1233
00:52:54.590 --> 00:52:57.230
<v Speaker 1>You can see I'm with you on on so much </v>
<v Speaker 1>of this stuff.</v>

1234
00:52:57.290 --> 00:52:59.810
<v Speaker 1>And even though again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as I call myself a classical liberal,</v>

1235
00:52:59.811 --> 00:53:01.370
<v Speaker 1>there's plenty of room for agreement </v>
<v Speaker 1>here.</v>

1236
00:53:01.400 --> 00:53:02.210
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>great.</v>

1237
00:53:02.260 --> 00:53:07.260
<v Speaker 1>And where there is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where there might be little </v>

1238
00:53:07.260 --> 00:53:07.260
<v Speaker 1>disagreement.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's rich,</v>

1239
00:53:07.260 --> 00:53:07.420
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well that's a great place to do.</v>

1240
00:53:07.520 --> 00:53:12.520
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What I'm a little concerned about is </v>

1241
00:53:12.520 --> 00:53:12.520
<v Speaker 1>that the movement of liberty is going to</v>
<v Speaker 1>grow and grow and grow.</v>

1242
00:53:12.520 --> 00:53:15.800
<v Speaker 1>It's going to be real nice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You'll probably do pretty well if,</v>

1243
00:53:15.810 --> 00:53:17.990
<v Speaker 1>if not when you'll do pretty well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Austin,</v>

1244
00:53:17.991 --> 00:53:22.991
<v Speaker 1>if not when will do pretty well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think there were a couple other </v>

1245
00:53:22.991 --> 00:53:25.361
<v Speaker 1>candidates around that are going to do </v>
<v Speaker 1>pretty well and then it will grow into </v>

1246
00:53:25.361 --> 00:53:28.811
<v Speaker 1>something that nationally come 20,</v>
<v Speaker 1>20 is going to be actually more viable </v>

1247
00:53:29.131 --> 00:53:34.131
<v Speaker 1>than it was even under Gary Johnson.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They'll get someone that's probably </v>

1248
00:53:34.131 --> 00:53:34.131
<v Speaker 1>younger and more tech savvy and </v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever.</v>

1249
00:53:34.131 --> 00:53:38.781
<v Speaker 1>It'll be someone kind of cool and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that they are going to then take </v>

1250
00:53:38.781 --> 00:53:43.071
<v Speaker 1>like they're going to pull it some </v>
<v Speaker 1>unheard of number for libertarians out </v>

1251
00:53:43.071 --> 00:53:43.590
<v Speaker 1>of national level,</v>
<v Speaker 1>something like 15 percent.</v>

1252
00:53:43.620 --> 00:53:45.180
<v Speaker 1>And we're gonna win electoral votes in </v>
<v Speaker 1>20,</v>

1253
00:53:45.181 --> 00:53:46.770
<v Speaker 1>20.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So all good.</v>

1254
00:53:47.530 --> 00:53:48.990
<v Speaker 1>We are going to an electoral votes.</v>

1255
00:53:49.110 --> 00:53:54.110
<v Speaker 1>So I'm with Ya and I agree,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but do you see why I see the danger </v>

1256
00:53:54.110 --> 00:53:57.561
<v Speaker 1>there too was dangerous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The oncoming danger would be that you'd </v>

1257
00:53:57.561 --> 00:54:00.681
<v Speaker 1>be pulling all of those votes from the </v>
<v Speaker 1>right and that you end up help.</v>

1258
00:54:01.260 --> 00:54:06.260
<v Speaker 1>Now I know this is not a defense of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>right and I got what I what if you then </v>

1259
00:54:08.971 --> 00:54:12.420
<v Speaker 1>end up with some.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Seriously good.</v>

1260
00:54:12.421 --> 00:54:13.290
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Good.</v>

1261
00:54:13.291 --> 00:54:14.980
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sell me on this very clear.</v>

1262
00:54:15.150 --> 00:54:16.950
<v Speaker 1>We have two choices.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Option one,</v>

1263
00:54:17.280 --> 00:54:22.280
<v Speaker 1>stay in this slow road to oblivion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is where we're going now or shake </v>

1264
00:54:22.291 --> 00:54:27.291
<v Speaker 1>things up and get them to happen here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Someone asked where the night I was at </v>

1265
00:54:27.291 --> 00:54:27.291
<v Speaker 1>an event.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was at a,</v>

1266
00:54:27.291 --> 00:54:30.741
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a sportsman's event of the night in </v>

1267
00:54:30.741 --> 00:54:30.741
<v Speaker 1>Suffolk County last night.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the guy said,</v>

1268
00:54:30.741 --> 00:54:30.920
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Larry,</v>

1269
00:54:30.930 --> 00:54:35.930
<v Speaker 1>we have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what if you take a lot from the </v>

1270
00:54:35.930 --> 00:54:35.930
<v Speaker 1>Republican?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

1271
00:54:35.930 --> 00:54:37.200
<v Speaker 1>I hope I tear him to pieces.</v>

1272
00:54:37.380 --> 00:54:39.480
<v Speaker 1>I hope I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I hope he gets five percent.</v>

1273
00:54:39.930 --> 00:54:40.950
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What happened?</v>

1274
00:54:41.190 --> 00:54:44.940
<v Speaker 1>Then Republicans will learn their lesson</v>
<v Speaker 1>and have to be Republicans.</v>

1275
00:54:45.330 --> 00:54:47.850
<v Speaker 1>They can't be Democrat lite anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Good.</v>

1276
00:54:48.060 --> 00:54:49.620
<v Speaker 1>I hope.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I hope that happens.</v>

1277
00:54:49.621 --> 00:54:50.400
<v Speaker 1>Let it happen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't care.</v>

1278
00:54:50.520 --> 00:54:51.660
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Democrats get killed.</v>

1279
00:54:51.690 --> 00:54:53.040
<v Speaker 1>Get that smashed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Good.</v>

1280
00:54:53.160 --> 00:54:55.560
<v Speaker 1>Maybe we don't have to care about civil </v>
<v Speaker 1>liberties.</v>

1281
00:54:56.250 --> 00:54:59.460
<v Speaker 1>If Libertarians do well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>regardless of who's crushed,</v>

1282
00:54:59.880 --> 00:55:04.880
<v Speaker 1>whoever gets crushed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their lesson has to be learned or they </v>

1283
00:55:04.880 --> 00:55:04.880
<v Speaker 1>disappear.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They disappear.</v>

1284
00:55:04.890 --> 00:55:06.270
<v Speaker 1>We replaced them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Awesome.</v>

1285
00:55:06.540 --> 00:55:08.340
<v Speaker 1>They don't disappear.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They get better.</v>

1286
00:55:08.820 --> 00:55:13.260
<v Speaker 1>There's nothing but good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I asked crushing either side or both.</v>

1287
00:55:13.320 --> 00:55:14.910
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess whatever the Republicans.</v>

1288
00:55:14.970 --> 00:55:16.740
<v Speaker 1>So what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>There'll be better Republicans,</v>

1289
00:55:17.270 --> 00:55:18.790
<v Speaker 1>Democrats.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what they'll be,</v>

1290
00:55:18.791 --> 00:55:20.010
<v Speaker 1>but Democrats.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't matter.</v>

1291
00:55:20.070 --> 00:55:25.070
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess it's the hammer that you </v>

1292
00:55:25.070 --> 00:55:25.070
<v Speaker 1>ultimately need.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's correct.</v>

1293
00:55:25.070 --> 00:55:28.131
<v Speaker 1>My,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my fear would be that then because I </v>

1294
00:55:28.131 --> 00:55:30.891
<v Speaker 1>believe the left has gone so far left </v>
<v Speaker 1>that the idea of potentially helping </v>

1295
00:55:31.051 --> 00:55:36.051
<v Speaker 1>them put in policies that would be a 180</v>
<v Speaker 1>degrees from everything you just said </v>

1296
00:55:36.150 --> 00:55:36.390
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>

1297
00:55:36.540 --> 00:55:41.540
<v Speaker 1>That would put in all the deblazio stuff</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you hate in New York City and all </v>

1298
00:55:41.540 --> 00:55:41.940
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That I would really,</v>

1299
00:55:41.941 --> 00:55:46.941
<v Speaker 1>really fear that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you just view it as almost a </v>

1300
00:55:46.941 --> 00:55:48.951
<v Speaker 1>necessary evil to myself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now you're assuming that when this </v>

1301
00:55:48.951 --> 00:55:50.340
<v Speaker 1>happens,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people jump on board.</v>

1302
00:55:50.490 --> 00:55:52.290
<v Speaker 1>They don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They give up [inaudible].</v>

1303
00:55:52.320 --> 00:55:55.500
<v Speaker 1>New York is an example of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Seventy percent don't vote.</v>

1304
00:55:56.370 --> 00:55:58.590
<v Speaker 1>The people don't actually like these </v>
<v Speaker 1>ideas.</v>

1305
00:55:58.890 --> 00:56:01.410
<v Speaker 1>They've given up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They think there's no hope.</v>

1306
00:56:01.530 --> 00:56:03.090
<v Speaker 1>So they've given up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Guess what?</v>

1307
00:56:03.240 --> 00:56:03.930
<v Speaker 1>Here comes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mr.</v>

1308
00:56:04.020 --> 00:56:09.020
<v Speaker 1>Hope this opens the door for me so it </v>
<v Speaker 1>happens.</v>

1309
00:56:09.961 --> 00:56:14.961
<v Speaker 1>And Twenty,</v>
<v Speaker 1>20 libertarians are amazing and we </v>

1310
00:56:14.961 --> 00:56:17.750
<v Speaker 1>crushed the right it does happen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And as a whatever Bernie is the </v>

1311
00:56:17.750 --> 00:56:18.150
<v Speaker 1>president,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever the case may be,</v>

1312
00:56:18.630 --> 00:56:20.400
<v Speaker 1>all the people have no hope.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When 20,</v>

1313
00:56:20.401 --> 00:56:21.780
<v Speaker 1>22 comes around for the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for the,</v>

1314
00:56:21.810 --> 00:56:22.330
<v Speaker 1>for the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1315
00:56:22.470 --> 00:56:27.010
<v Speaker 1>Senate races and for the House races,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you will watch libertarians say,</v>

1316
00:56:27.011 --> 00:56:28.710
<v Speaker 1>see what happened,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hope.</v>

1317
00:56:28.710 --> 00:56:32.770
<v Speaker 1>And you will watch a sleeping a power in</v>
<v Speaker 1>22 and then 20,</v>

1318
00:56:32.771 --> 00:56:33.850
<v Speaker 1>24,</v>
<v Speaker 1>boom.</v>

1319
00:56:33.851 --> 00:56:36.160
<v Speaker 1>You'll watch the presidency.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Good,</v>

1320
00:56:36.880 --> 00:56:38.680
<v Speaker 1>good and Democrat to be afraid of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They won't.</v>

1321
00:56:38.740 --> 00:56:41.760
<v Speaker 1>The other thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we know everything and they'll lose it.</v>

1322
00:56:41.761 --> 00:56:46.761
<v Speaker 1>The loss of Hillary,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was that we know everything and </v>

1323
00:56:46.761 --> 00:56:49.591
<v Speaker 1>trump beat them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or they'll change either way too when I </v>

1324
00:56:49.591 --> 00:56:50.980
<v Speaker 1>have no worries.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

1325
00:56:51.010 --> 00:56:52.540
<v Speaker 1>I hope you're right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't care which one happens.</v>

1326
00:56:52.870 --> 00:56:54.580
<v Speaker 1>Crush both.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Crush either is irrelevant.</v>

1327
00:56:55.060 --> 00:56:57.880
<v Speaker 1>It's the right answer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the only way you make the change.</v>

1328
00:56:58.090 --> 00:56:59.890
<v Speaker 1>Whenever you have to have positive </v>
<v Speaker 1>change,</v>

1329
00:56:59.891 --> 00:57:03.490
<v Speaker 1>there has to be some disruption.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we're afraid of disruption.</v>

1330
00:57:03.810 --> 00:57:08.810
<v Speaker 1>You can't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's just let people know that it will </v>

1331
00:57:08.810 --> 00:57:11.131
<v Speaker 1>be disruption.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's hold their hand through it and </v>

1332
00:57:11.131 --> 00:57:11.131
<v Speaker 1>boom it besides.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Awesome.</v>

1333
00:57:11.370 --> 00:57:16.370
<v Speaker 1>Alright,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's just knock out a couple of </v>

1334
00:57:16.370 --> 00:57:17.661
<v Speaker 1>policies and then uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then I send you back to New York to get </v>

1335
00:57:17.661 --> 00:57:17.661
<v Speaker 1>cracking.</v>

1336
00:57:17.661 --> 00:57:18.100
<v Speaker 1>I do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I worked with.</v>

1337
00:57:18.270 --> 00:57:19.150
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1338
00:57:19.151 --> 00:57:21.040
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I think on the drug stuff,</v>

1339
00:57:21.070 --> 00:57:22.690
<v Speaker 1>marijuana,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're for legalization,</v>

1340
00:57:22.691 --> 00:57:24.490
<v Speaker 1>correct.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not just marijuana,</v>

1341
00:57:24.491 --> 00:57:27.220
<v Speaker 1>but also hemp and I want it to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>regulated.</v>

1342
00:57:27.221 --> 00:57:29.950
<v Speaker 1>As I say this all the time for farmers </v>
<v Speaker 1>like onions,</v>

1343
00:57:30.580 --> 00:57:33.340
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to write new rules and </v>
<v Speaker 1>regulations that will take forever.</v>

1344
00:57:33.430 --> 00:57:35.320
<v Speaker 1>I want us to take onions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cut and paste,</v>

1345
00:57:36.010 --> 00:57:41.010
<v Speaker 1>hemp marijuana go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the reason why I want that is our </v>

1346
00:57:41.010 --> 00:57:41.860
<v Speaker 1>farmers in New York state are struggling</v>
<v Speaker 1>desperately,</v>

1347
00:57:42.430 --> 00:57:44.720
<v Speaker 1>so why don't we allow them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If they want you to grow hemp,</v>

1348
00:57:44.721 --> 00:57:46.420
<v Speaker 1>to grow marijuana,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they want to enjoy.</v>

1349
00:57:46.421 --> 00:57:47.500
<v Speaker 1>Go ahead,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do what they want,</v>

1350
00:57:47.890 --> 00:57:52.890
<v Speaker 1>but not just that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People talking about marijuana and </v>

1351
00:57:52.890 --> 00:57:52.890
<v Speaker 1>cannabis products as being expensive and</v>
<v Speaker 1>taxed.</v>

1352
00:57:52.890 --> 00:57:55.200
<v Speaker 1>If it's regular,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like onions grow in your backyard,</v>

1353
00:57:56.200 --> 00:57:58.750
<v Speaker 1>don't care growing your back yard will </v>
<v Speaker 1>allow.</v>

1354
00:57:58.780 --> 00:58:00.280
<v Speaker 1>How do we celebrate a tax the hell out </v>
<v Speaker 1>of it?</v>

1355
00:58:00.490 --> 00:58:01.930
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then we create a black market,</v>

1356
00:58:01.931 --> 00:58:06.370
<v Speaker 1>which we have now officially you can get</v>
<v Speaker 1>medical marijuana in New York officially</v>

1357
00:58:06.371 --> 00:58:09.760
<v Speaker 1>you can one place in New York City and a</v>
<v Speaker 1>massive black market.</v>

1358
00:58:10.450 --> 00:58:13.710
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So instead like helpful sor seller,</v>

1359
00:58:13.750 --> 00:58:14.680
<v Speaker 1>like you know what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's helpful store,</v>

1360
00:58:14.970 --> 00:58:17.290
<v Speaker 1>but a regulation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no relation to health plus those</v>

1361
00:58:17.291 --> 00:58:22.291
<v Speaker 1>either.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're all the desks from all the health </v>

1362
00:58:22.291 --> 00:58:22.291
<v Speaker 1>was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well GNC got so whatever.</v>

1363
00:58:22.291 --> 00:58:22.810
<v Speaker 1>They're all the desks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>None.</v>

1364
00:58:22.930 --> 00:58:27.930
<v Speaker 1>I think I went over the data with data </v>
<v Speaker 1>and create a team maybe once we go for </v>

1365
00:58:27.930 --> 00:58:31.790
<v Speaker 1>hitting the gym a long time ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the FDA has killed far more people </v>

1366
00:58:31.790 --> 00:58:32.980
<v Speaker 1>than every health food store ever </v>
<v Speaker 1>created.</v>

1367
00:58:33.280 --> 00:58:34.870
<v Speaker 1>So really like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's fine.</v>

1368
00:58:34.871 --> 00:58:36.490
<v Speaker 1>Put a thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not regular by FDA.</v>

1369
00:58:36.760 --> 00:58:37.750
<v Speaker 1>Good luck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whatever.</v>

1370
00:58:37.840 --> 00:58:38.800
<v Speaker 1>I don't care.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do what you want.</v>

1371
00:58:39.200 --> 00:58:44.200
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's just do a couple of other hot </v>

1372
00:58:44.200 --> 00:58:44.200
<v Speaker 1>button ones.</v>

1373
00:58:44.200 --> 00:58:45.310
<v Speaker 1>So a guns where you at?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What does that mean?</v>

1374
00:58:45.940 --> 00:58:50.940
<v Speaker 1>While we were yet know if people in New </v>
<v Speaker 1>York City itself want farm where </v>

1375
00:58:50.940 --> 00:58:51.330
<v Speaker 1>treatment?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1376
00:58:51.400 --> 00:58:56.400
<v Speaker 1>that's fine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The fact it's a big deal in New York </v>

1377
00:58:56.400 --> 00:59:00.620
<v Speaker 1>that you may or may not know what the </v>
<v Speaker 1>safe act came out after sandy hook and </v>

1378
00:59:00.620 --> 00:59:01.390
<v Speaker 1>it basically made a bunch of equipment </v>
<v Speaker 1>illegal,</v>

1379
00:59:01.750 --> 00:59:04.960
<v Speaker 1>so it made a bunch of people who own </v>
<v Speaker 1>firearms legally,</v>

1380
00:59:05.650 --> 00:59:10.650
<v Speaker 1>criminals overnight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and now they put you in jail and not </v>

1381
00:59:10.650 --> 00:59:10.650
<v Speaker 1>just that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you have a magazine,</v>

1382
00:59:10.650 --> 00:59:10.870
<v Speaker 1>have a member of the rule,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1383
00:59:11.020 --> 00:59:13.000
<v Speaker 1>If you're a magazine can fit 11 rounds </v>
<v Speaker 1>in it,</v>

1384
00:59:13.930 --> 00:59:17.570
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you are now a violent felon according to</v>

1385
00:59:17.580 --> 00:59:21.320
<v Speaker 1>state law to Baba Felon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's how bad is.</v>

1386
00:59:21.440 --> 00:59:26.440
<v Speaker 1>The safe act is terrible and now we're </v>
<v Speaker 1>talking about idea of taking guns for </v>

1387
00:59:26.440 --> 00:59:29.021
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I told you if the children in school </v>

1388
00:59:29.021 --> 00:59:32.151
<v Speaker 1>with he did,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he says that the child is a problem </v>

1389
00:59:32.151 --> 00:59:32.151
<v Speaker 1>child.</v>

1390
00:59:32.151 --> 00:59:35.230
<v Speaker 1>They go take your guns if you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>mentally ill to your guns and they in </v>

1391
00:59:35.230 --> 00:59:36.380
<v Speaker 1>New York state includes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're transgendered,</v>

1392
00:59:37.460 --> 00:59:39.320
<v Speaker 1>she don't get to have guns.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're transgender in New York state.</v>

1393
00:59:39.770 --> 00:59:41.420
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's embarrassing how bad this </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing is.</v>

1394
00:59:41.421 --> 00:59:43.130
<v Speaker 1>It's terrible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That has to be repealed.</v>

1395
00:59:43.190 --> 00:59:44.900
<v Speaker 1>I can't repeal the law.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm the governor.</v>

1396
00:59:45.170 --> 00:59:48.060
<v Speaker 1>So I knew it was like the beginning of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pardon people who were convicted of it,</v>

1397
00:59:48.070 --> 00:59:50.840
<v Speaker 1>but a thousand people in New York state </v>
<v Speaker 1>have convicted of safe act.</v>

1398
00:59:51.270 --> 00:59:54.290
<v Speaker 1>I'm a infringements about about a </v>
<v Speaker 1>thousand.</v>

1399
00:59:54.620 --> 00:59:56.420
<v Speaker 1>I'll begin partnering them within the </v>
<v Speaker 1>First Ninety days.</v>

1400
00:59:56.480 --> 01:00:01.480
<v Speaker 1>So we have people in jail in New York </v>
<v Speaker 1>right now who were doing something </v>

1401
01:00:01.480 --> 01:00:01.610
<v Speaker 1>completely legally.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The law change.</v>

1402
01:00:01.611 --> 01:00:03.610
<v Speaker 1>And then they were put in jail.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That correct that.</v>

1403
01:00:03.630 --> 01:00:04.520
<v Speaker 1>That is incredible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

1404
01:00:04.521 --> 01:00:05.780
<v Speaker 1>that's correct.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's guns,</v>

1405
01:00:05.810 --> 01:00:06.940
<v Speaker 1>therefore it's evil.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1406
01:00:07.700 --> 01:00:09.680
<v Speaker 1>Remember how New York state works and </v>
<v Speaker 1>York state works.</v>

1407
01:00:09.920 --> 01:00:10.400
<v Speaker 1>It's evil.</v>

1408
01:00:10.400 --> 01:00:14.630
<v Speaker 1>Hit it with a stick.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's our first always first reaction.</v>

1409
01:00:15.050 --> 01:00:16.160
<v Speaker 1>What is that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He with a stick.</v>

1410
01:00:16.520 --> 01:00:18.140
<v Speaker 1>So we do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So yes.</v>

1411
01:00:18.141 --> 01:00:20.360
<v Speaker 1>That's true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Actually met James Time at the first guy</v>

1412
01:00:20.361 --> 01:00:25.361
<v Speaker 1>who got his first conviction.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's a three time convicted felon I </v>

1413
01:00:25.361 --> 01:00:25.361
<v Speaker 1>think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if not mistaken.</v>

1414
01:00:25.361 --> 01:00:28.070
<v Speaker 1>So I'll be in pardoning when I sought to</v>
<v Speaker 1>pardon.</v>

1415
01:00:28.580 --> 01:00:31.070
<v Speaker 1>That will let people know I'm serious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Stop.</v>

1416
01:00:31.460 --> 01:00:36.460
<v Speaker 1>That was going to happen when I pardon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Reason why people don't pardon early is </v>

1417
01:00:36.460 --> 01:00:36.740
<v Speaker 1>because what's going to happen when I </v>
<v Speaker 1>pardon a hundred people?</v>

1418
01:00:37.250 --> 01:00:42.250
<v Speaker 1>What I'm gonna do something stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're going to go rob a liquor store </v>

1419
01:00:42.250 --> 01:00:43.160
<v Speaker 1>or a car or whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do something bad,</v>

1420
01:00:43.161 --> 01:00:44.600
<v Speaker 1>beat their spouse,</v>
<v Speaker 1>insert thing here.</v>

1421
01:00:44.810 --> 01:00:49.810
<v Speaker 1>What are they going to do?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I get it's going to happen and when it </v>

1422
01:00:49.810 --> 01:00:49.810
<v Speaker 1>happens,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're going to blame me.</v>

1423
01:00:49.810 --> 01:00:49.810
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>governor sharp.</v>

1424
01:00:49.810 --> 01:00:50.840
<v Speaker 1>You already have a guy.</v>

1425
01:00:50.870 --> 01:00:55.870
<v Speaker 1>This liquor store got robbed because you</v>
<v Speaker 1>let a guy out because he was a violent </v>

1426
01:00:55.870 --> 01:00:57.020
<v Speaker 1>felon and I'm going to say several </v>
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>

1427
01:00:57.090 --> 01:00:59.270
<v Speaker 1>One,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't care when I.</v>

1428
01:00:59.271 --> 01:01:02.780
<v Speaker 1>When everyone's gonna hate me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to be attacked everyday by the</v>

1429
01:01:02.781 --> 01:01:05.660
<v Speaker 1>assembly everyday by the Senate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everyday by the press,</v>

1430
01:01:05.810 --> 01:01:07.220
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to have an assembly and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Senate.</v>

1431
01:01:07.221 --> 01:01:10.130
<v Speaker 1>That's completely against me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's one of a bazillion things.</v>

1432
01:01:10.170 --> 01:01:11.720
<v Speaker 1>Won't care,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but not just that.</v>

1433
01:01:13.190 --> 01:01:14.750
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One guy did something wrong.</v>

1434
01:01:15.050 --> 01:01:20.050
<v Speaker 1>Put that guy in jail for that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I even had people write that they got </v>

1435
01:01:20.050 --> 01:01:24.850
<v Speaker 1>off and our nation was built on the idea</v>
<v Speaker 1>that it would be better for a guilty </v>

1436
01:01:24.850 --> 01:01:26.410
<v Speaker 1>person,</v>
<v Speaker 1>go free than an innocent person to be in</v>

1437
01:01:26.411 --> 01:01:30.950
<v Speaker 1>prison will get 99 out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm okay with that and when I do that,</v>

1438
01:01:30.980 --> 01:01:35.980
<v Speaker 1>the assembly will see that I will take </v>
<v Speaker 1>the heat for them and when they see that</v>

1439
01:01:36.860 --> 01:01:41.860
<v Speaker 1>in 2019 they'll repeal in 20 slash 20 </v>
<v Speaker 1>because I've given them the air cover </v>

1440
01:01:42.110 --> 01:01:47.110
<v Speaker 1>and on top of that I'm going to veto any</v>
<v Speaker 1>bill that has any safe act enforcement </v>

1441
01:01:47.110 --> 01:01:48.260
<v Speaker 1>funding gone.</v>

1442
01:01:48.500 --> 01:01:53.500
<v Speaker 1>They won't bother putting it in because </v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll veto it and they will now have to </v>

1443
01:01:53.500 --> 01:01:55.520
<v Speaker 1>double down on it as a separate piece </v>
<v Speaker 1>that will crush them on the right.</v>

1444
01:01:55.790 --> 01:02:00.790
<v Speaker 1>They won't do it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that means you will not be enforced </v>

1445
01:02:00.790 --> 01:02:02.270
<v Speaker 1>and I'll begin and I will actually be in</v>
<v Speaker 1>pardoning people as they get arrested.</v>

1446
01:02:02.670 --> 01:02:04.200
<v Speaker 1>Prosecutors love it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Easy going.</v>

1447
01:02:04.250 --> 01:02:09.250
<v Speaker 1>Easy conviction.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cops hated the cops will love that I'm </v>

1448
01:02:09.250 --> 01:02:10.490
<v Speaker 1>not enforcing anymore and they will </v>
<v Speaker 1>happily on it.</v>

1449
01:02:11.060 --> 01:02:14.030
<v Speaker 1>It becomes useless in 2019 gets repealed</v>
<v Speaker 1>in 2020.</v>

1450
01:02:14.600 --> 01:02:19.600
<v Speaker 1>By the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I copy the same model for marijuana </v>

1451
01:02:19.600 --> 01:02:19.600
<v Speaker 1>laws.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Same model,</v>

1452
01:02:19.600 --> 01:02:21.230
<v Speaker 1>same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Begin begin to a pardon.</v>

1453
01:02:21.240 --> 01:02:23.970
<v Speaker 1>People who are convicted of nonviolent </v>
<v Speaker 1>marijuana possessions.</v>

1454
01:02:24.210 --> 01:02:25.920
<v Speaker 1>Stop enforcing it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Same idea,</v>

1455
01:02:25.921 --> 01:02:27.930
<v Speaker 1>same concept.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They see how it works.</v>

1456
01:02:27.931 --> 01:02:28.410
<v Speaker 1>Twenty,</v>
<v Speaker 1>20,</v>

1457
01:02:28.411 --> 01:02:29.140
<v Speaker 1>repealed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1458
01:02:29.370 --> 01:02:34.370
<v Speaker 1>it's just incredible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You found and I followed that by the </v>

1459
01:02:34.370 --> 01:02:34.370
<v Speaker 1>way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

1460
01:02:34.370 --> 01:02:37.310
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the veto and that model is the Gary </v>

1461
01:02:37.310 --> 01:02:37.310
<v Speaker 1>Johnson model.</v>

1462
01:02:37.310 --> 01:02:37.310
<v Speaker 1>Alright.</v>
<v Speaker 1>GimMe Gimme.</v>

1463
01:02:37.310 --> 01:02:42.200
<v Speaker 1>One more thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's an important issue to you before </v>

1464
01:02:42.200 --> 01:02:42.200
<v Speaker 1>we were at.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's tons of them,</v>

1465
01:02:42.200 --> 01:02:42.780
<v Speaker 1>but those are good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mentioned the other one,</v>

1466
01:02:42.781 --> 01:02:44.220
<v Speaker 1>the vaping,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Duis.</v>

1467
01:02:44.370 --> 01:02:49.370
<v Speaker 1>I mentioned that also.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm also the biggest idea though of all </v>

1468
01:02:49.370 --> 01:02:51.240
<v Speaker 1>of them is the unfunded mandate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have to localize government.</v>

1469
01:02:51.630 --> 01:02:56.630
<v Speaker 1>If we take away,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if we take away the unfunded mandates </v>

1470
01:02:56.630 --> 01:02:57.870
<v Speaker 1>now individual counties can decide.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In Baltimore they want people to say the</v>

1471
01:02:57.871 --> 01:02:58.950
<v Speaker 1>same thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but Larry,</v>

1472
01:02:59.550 --> 01:03:03.120
<v Speaker 1>if that happens then I won't get what I </v>
<v Speaker 1>want.</v>

1473
01:03:03.450 --> 01:03:08.450
<v Speaker 1>Now you can just show them before if you</v>
<v Speaker 1>like what your county's doing.</v>

1474
01:03:08.670 --> 01:03:10.950
<v Speaker 1>Don't change a thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Show up,</v>

1475
01:03:10.980 --> 01:03:14.610
<v Speaker 1>vote yes on everything and you're good,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if you don't,</v>

1476
01:03:14.611 --> 01:03:17.040
<v Speaker 1>you can change it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's really the key to libertarianism.</v>

1477
01:03:17.041 --> 01:03:22.041
<v Speaker 1>You might have to be involved.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You might show up and talk to your </v>

1478
01:03:22.041 --> 01:03:24.540
<v Speaker 1>neighbor and tell them why you care </v>
<v Speaker 1>about a certain policy or issue.</v>

1479
01:03:24.750 --> 01:03:26.790
<v Speaker 1>You might have to care about stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

1480
01:03:26.791 --> 01:03:29.410
<v Speaker 1>Larry can't someone else do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They couldn't do it.</v>

1481
01:03:29.460 --> 01:03:34.460
<v Speaker 1>Now the other thing is a sale time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but laterally dead Kennedys will make </v>

1482
01:03:34.460 --> 01:03:35.160
<v Speaker 1>arrows.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They'll make mistakes and fail.</v>

1483
01:03:35.310 --> 01:03:37.560
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we're all failing.</v>

1484
01:03:37.561 --> 01:03:40.470
<v Speaker 1>Now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The state's bleeding to death.</v>

1485
01:03:41.280 --> 01:03:43.650
<v Speaker 1>I want to follow the Google model.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Google model says,</v>

1486
01:03:44.180 --> 01:03:49.180
<v Speaker 1>20 percent of your time can be used in </v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever you want as long as you're </v>

1487
01:03:49.180 --> 01:03:49.180
<v Speaker 1>transparent until but as what you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>doing.</v>

1488
01:03:49.530 --> 01:03:51.870
<v Speaker 1>Counties do what you want.</v>
<v Speaker 1>However we want to vote,</v>

1489
01:03:52.500 --> 01:03:54.330
<v Speaker 1>but transparency of almost see what's </v>
<v Speaker 1>happening.</v>

1490
01:03:55.200 --> 01:03:56.250
<v Speaker 1>We do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What happens?</v>

1491
01:03:56.310 --> 01:03:57.510
<v Speaker 1>Some fail,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some succeed,</v>

1492
01:03:57.960 --> 01:03:59.610
<v Speaker 1>but we then learn what works and what </v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't.</v>

1493
01:03:59.970 --> 01:04:04.970
<v Speaker 1>We shift and adjust regions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We'll figure out what works for each </v>

1494
01:04:04.970 --> 01:04:04.970
<v Speaker 1>region and we'll actually have </v>
<v Speaker 1>improvement.</v>

1495
01:04:04.970 --> 01:04:09.561
<v Speaker 1>This,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this disruption that happens before you </v>

1496
01:04:09.561 --> 01:04:09.561
<v Speaker 1>have success,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's happens in business.</v>

1497
01:04:09.561 --> 01:04:12.180
<v Speaker 1>It happens in every and habits in life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything,</v>

1498
01:04:12.480 --> 01:04:14.400
<v Speaker 1>so we do that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>become a sharing state,</v>

1499
01:04:14.520 --> 01:04:15.330
<v Speaker 1>sharing economy.</v>

1500
01:04:15.780 --> 01:04:18.250
<v Speaker 1>We change how things work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Being on top of that,</v>

1501
01:04:18.251 --> 01:04:23.251
<v Speaker 1>that's one part.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The second thing you do is you add </v>

1502
01:04:23.251 --> 01:04:23.251
<v Speaker 1>what's called a charitable choice credit</v>
<v Speaker 1>for your taxes.</v>

1503
01:04:23.660 --> 01:04:28.660
<v Speaker 1>What that is is 20 bucks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That would be your tax money going to </v>

1504
01:04:28.660 --> 01:04:28.660
<v Speaker 1>the tax man anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your choice.</v>

1505
01:04:29.070 --> 01:04:30.660
<v Speaker 1>You can give it to a nonprofit if you </v>
<v Speaker 1>want to,</v>

1506
01:04:30.920 --> 01:04:32.700
<v Speaker 1>if you want to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's going out of your pocket anyway.</v>

1507
01:04:33.150 --> 01:04:36.150
<v Speaker 1>You want to go to a nonprofit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can plus another 2:50</v>

1508
01:04:36.210 --> 01:04:39.310
<v Speaker 1>in your own county.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if I were in a box of your money into</v>

1509
01:04:39.311 --> 01:04:41.640
<v Speaker 1>your accounting for the sake of argument</v>
<v Speaker 1>in this area,</v>

1510
01:04:41.670 --> 01:04:43.560
<v Speaker 1>there are 40,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>people who pay taxes.</v>

1511
01:04:43.980 --> 01:04:46.710
<v Speaker 1>That's 2 million possible dollars </v>
<v Speaker 1>voluntary.</v>

1512
01:04:47.490 --> 01:04:48.600
<v Speaker 1>If you want to do it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do it again.</v>

1513
01:04:48.601 --> 01:04:50.940
<v Speaker 1>If you like your government,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't change it.</v>

1514
01:04:51.360 --> 01:04:52.380
<v Speaker 1>Don't do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You got it,</v>

1515
01:04:52.440 --> 01:04:53.310
<v Speaker 1>you're good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You like it,</v>

1516
01:04:53.640 --> 01:04:55.440
<v Speaker 1>but say if it is a better way for </v>
<v Speaker 1>childcare,</v>

1517
01:04:55.860 --> 01:04:58.050
<v Speaker 1>besides the only government monopoly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is a disaster,</v>

1518
01:04:58.470 --> 01:05:02.220
<v Speaker 1>maybe is a better way for a glen roads,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which government is a disaster.</v>

1519
01:05:02.310 --> 01:05:05.490
<v Speaker 1>There's a better way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A private company now can lobby you,</v>

1520
01:05:05.810 --> 01:05:10.380
<v Speaker 1>not the government because you give them</v>
<v Speaker 1>money and the more money you give,</v>

1521
01:05:10.470 --> 01:05:11.780
<v Speaker 1>the less corruption there is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1522
01:05:11.850 --> 01:05:16.850
<v Speaker 1>I love that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The more transparency there is let's </v>

1523
01:05:16.850 --> 01:05:18.861
<v Speaker 1>crush or it allows the actual counties </v>
<v Speaker 1>to begin to prioritize as they want,</v>

1524
01:05:19.690 --> 01:05:24.690
<v Speaker 1>as they see it work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They can make that more or less or </v>

1525
01:05:24.690 --> 01:05:25.150
<v Speaker 1>shift.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is the beginning part.</v>

1526
01:05:25.151 --> 01:05:30.151
<v Speaker 1>I'm talking about showing them that </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's other ways of getting things </v>

1527
01:05:30.151 --> 01:05:34.051
<v Speaker 1>done besides government and there's not </v>
<v Speaker 1>a Zombie apocalypse on top of how do I </v>

1528
01:05:34.051 --> 01:05:38.101
<v Speaker 1>also raise money or what is the </v>
<v Speaker 1>libertarian responds to the Zombie </v>

1529
01:05:38.101 --> 01:05:38.101
<v Speaker 1>Apocalypse?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

1530
01:05:38.101 --> 01:05:41.300
<v Speaker 1>I dunno,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess guns clients,</v>

1531
01:05:41.301 --> 01:05:41.840
<v Speaker 1>I guess.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1532
01:05:42.370 --> 01:05:43.890
<v Speaker 1>So there's another way of raising money </v>
<v Speaker 1>also,</v>

1533
01:05:43.900 --> 01:05:48.900
<v Speaker 1>whichever you bring up also.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that is naming rights on </v>

1534
01:05:48.900 --> 01:05:48.900
<v Speaker 1>infrastructure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1535
01:05:48.900 --> 01:05:52.650
<v Speaker 1>The MTA just in New York City is over 12</v>
<v Speaker 1>bridges and tunnels and right now what </v>

1536
01:05:52.650 --> 01:05:54.040
<v Speaker 1>we've done in New York state as we've </v>
<v Speaker 1>named one of our bridges after the Cuomo</v>

1537
01:05:54.041 --> 01:05:56.700
<v Speaker 1>family,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's called the marrow Como Bridge.</v>

1538
01:05:56.720 --> 01:05:59.750
<v Speaker 1>Now we have which bridges that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's what's happened now.</v>

1539
01:05:59.751 --> 01:06:02.020
<v Speaker 1>It is now that the imperial bridge of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the imperial family.</v>

1540
01:06:02.460 --> 01:06:06.130
<v Speaker 1>So now that has to go instead.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's,</v>

1541
01:06:06.180 --> 01:06:09.280
<v Speaker 1>let's leave out naming rights.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Could be the verizon bridge,</v>

1542
01:06:09.281 --> 01:06:11.380
<v Speaker 1>this sprint bridge,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the staples bridge,</v>

1543
01:06:11.381 --> 01:06:12.460
<v Speaker 1>the home depot breach.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't care.</v>

1544
01:06:12.461 --> 01:06:14.260
<v Speaker 1>You pick the person who wants it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1545
01:06:14.261 --> 01:06:17.890
<v Speaker 1>The company wants it now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They do this for already for stadiums.</v>

1546
01:06:18.280 --> 01:06:19.300
<v Speaker 1>They pay 10,</v>
<v Speaker 1>20,</v>

1547
01:06:19.301 --> 01:06:21.790
<v Speaker 1>$30,000,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>a year for something used half a year.</v>

1548
01:06:22.300 --> 01:06:24.490
<v Speaker 1>This is a bridge they can choose every </v>
<v Speaker 1>day.</v>

1549
01:06:24.910 --> 01:06:28.110
<v Speaker 1>Your name gets mentioned a hundred times</v>
<v Speaker 1>at least every morning.</v>

1550
01:06:28.140 --> 01:06:33.140
<v Speaker 1>Afternoon during rush hour on every </v>
<v Speaker 1>radio station in a 16 million person </v>

1551
01:06:33.140 --> 01:06:37.171
<v Speaker 1>metro area.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're telling me companies that paid </v>

1552
01:06:37.171 --> 01:06:39.321
<v Speaker 1>literally billions of dollars in </v>
<v Speaker 1>marketing every year went up </v>

1553
01:06:39.321 --> 01:06:39.321
<v Speaker 1>$100,000,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>in a bridge,</v>

1554
01:06:39.340 --> 01:06:41.290
<v Speaker 1>but here's a rule,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no tolls,</v>

1555
01:06:41.860 --> 01:06:44.680
<v Speaker 1>actual break for people and they control</v>
<v Speaker 1>maintenance.</v>

1556
01:06:45.600 --> 01:06:47.320
<v Speaker 1>If they control maintenance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>guess what?</v>

1557
01:06:47.560 --> 01:06:52.560
<v Speaker 1>No more corruption in the maintenance </v>
<v Speaker 1>industry anymore because now sprints </v>

1558
01:06:52.560 --> 01:06:55.771
<v Speaker 1>paying for not the government,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no more closing lanes at the closing </v>

1559
01:06:55.771 --> 01:06:55.771
<v Speaker 1>lanes in bw.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bridge goes away.</v>

1560
01:06:55.771 --> 01:06:56.650
<v Speaker 1>Sprints,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can put up with it.</v>

1561
01:06:57.250 --> 01:06:58.550
<v Speaker 1>There's potholes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sprints.</v>

1562
01:06:58.551 --> 01:06:59.920
<v Speaker 1>I can put up with it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They'll follow you so you.</v>

1563
01:07:00.430 --> 01:07:05.430
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These are different ideas that people </v>

1564
01:07:05.430 --> 01:07:05.430
<v Speaker 1>that we have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Erie Canal in New York state,</v>

1565
01:07:05.430 --> 01:07:07.510
<v Speaker 1>it's about 500 and some odd miles of </v>
<v Speaker 1>Erie canal.</v>

1566
01:07:07.720 --> 01:07:11.290
<v Speaker 1>We can name the locks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's about three dozen blocks in blocks,</v>

1567
01:07:11.860 --> 01:07:16.860
<v Speaker 1>all different ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's so many ways of raising money </v>

1568
01:07:16.860 --> 01:07:17.980
<v Speaker 1>and changing how we look at this and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're not perfect by any means,</v>

1569
01:07:18.460 --> 01:07:23.460
<v Speaker 1>but there are conversations we need to </v>
<v Speaker 1>be having to ship this idea that the </v>

1570
01:07:23.460 --> 01:07:26.020
<v Speaker 1>only way to civilization and taxation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it isn't the only way.</v>

1571
01:07:26.050 --> 01:07:28.570
<v Speaker 1>It's a way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not the only way.</v>

1572
01:07:28.990 --> 01:07:31.750
<v Speaker 1>There were other options available and </v>
<v Speaker 1>people just don't get it.</v>

1573
01:07:31.750 --> 01:07:36.750
<v Speaker 1>You open this up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I believe that all the time they love </v>

1574
01:07:36.750 --> 01:07:36.750
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you ended up.</v>

1575
01:07:36.750 --> 01:07:36.750
<v Speaker 1>You Go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

1576
01:07:36.750 --> 01:07:36.750
<v Speaker 1>it's great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like that idea and we try that.</v>

1577
01:07:36.750 --> 01:07:38.470
<v Speaker 1>Someone is gonna be tried.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is what we want to do.</v>

1578
01:07:38.540 --> 01:07:43.540
<v Speaker 1>We shift the Way New York state runs and</v>
<v Speaker 1>the rest of the nation will follow.</v>

1579
01:07:45.340 --> 01:07:48.670
<v Speaker 1>If I just beat the Republican,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everyone will hear what I have to say.</v>

1580
01:07:48.900 --> 01:07:51.880
<v Speaker 1>I've been every TV show in the country.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They will hear what I have to say.</v>

1581
01:07:52.030 --> 01:07:54.850
<v Speaker 1>They'll hear this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They'll start telling their people,</v>

1582
01:07:54.970 --> 01:07:59.970
<v Speaker 1>they'll start copying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This campaign has the most possibility </v>

1583
01:07:59.970 --> 01:08:02.140
<v Speaker 1>for impact than any other campaign in </v>
<v Speaker 1>2018,</v>

1584
01:08:02.920 --> 01:08:06.070
<v Speaker 1>and here's what I promise you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If I raised $2,000,000</v>

1585
01:08:06.610 --> 01:08:08.800
<v Speaker 1>on the governor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's that simple.</v>

1586
01:08:09.430 --> 01:08:13.840
<v Speaker 1>2 million bucks on the governor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Done well.</v>

1587
01:08:14.680 --> 01:08:19.680
<v Speaker 1>I've enjoyed this conversation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think you've got the right set of </v>

1588
01:08:19.680 --> 01:08:19.680
<v Speaker 1>ideas and I look forward to seeing what </v>
<v Speaker 1>happens.</v>

1589
01:08:19.680 --> 01:08:21.680
<v Speaker 1>Good,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and now I'm going to send people to your</v>

1590
01:08:21.681 --> 01:08:23.210
<v Speaker 1>website because I assume you got a </v>
<v Speaker 1>doughnut,</v>

1591
01:08:23.211 --> 01:08:27.330
<v Speaker 1>but Larry sharp.com</v>
<v Speaker 1>lottery shot with an ie.</v>

1592
01:08:27.340 --> 01:08:32.340
<v Speaker 1>The e stands for electrical.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now I know you're really running because</v>

1593
01:08:32.361 --> 01:08:36.050
<v Speaker 1>he even pimped out the website telling </v>
<v Speaker 1>Larry sharp.com.</v>
