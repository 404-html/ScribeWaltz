1
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:03,100
Years

2
00:00:03,100 --> 00:00:03,933
is upon us,
so we're going to be doing a little 

3
00:00:04,421 --> 00:00:05,254
progress report here.
I hope you guys had a chance to check 

4
00:00:07,151 --> 00:00:09,760
out my interview from last week with 
Peter Boghossian.

5
00:00:10,120 --> 00:00:11,380
For those of you that might have missed 
it.

6
00:00:11,381 --> 00:00:15,880
My intention with Peter was to focus on 
atheism as well as critical thinking.

7
00:00:16,150 --> 00:00:18,610
These are ideas that Peter wrote his 
book about,

8
00:00:18,611 --> 00:00:19,444
spends most of his time talking about 
and are obviously topics that I'm 

9
00:00:22,061 --> 00:00:22,894
interested in.
I think at about 13 questions prepared 

10
00:00:25,121 --> 00:00:27,040
for Peter,
but like many of my interviews,

11
00:00:27,041 --> 00:00:27,874
the conversation pretty much just took a
life of its own and last week's case 

12
00:00:31,091 --> 00:00:31,924
though,
something particularly interesting 

13
00:00:32,860 --> 00:00:33,693
happened no matter how far I tried to 
steer the conversation away from the 

14
00:00:37,331 --> 00:00:41,710
regressive left and I tried many times.
All roads kept leading back to them.

15
00:00:42,760 --> 00:00:43,593
I've mentioned to you guys a couple 
times now how I want to talk about all 

16
00:00:45,581 --> 00:00:46,414
kinds of things on this show from 
science to politics to spirituality and 

17
00:00:49,271 --> 00:00:50,104
much more.

18
00:00:50,230 --> 00:00:51,063
I've also mentioned to you guys how I 
don't want to solely focus on the 

19
00:00:53,741 --> 00:00:57,460
regressive left primarily because it 
doesn't necessarily solve anything.

20
00:00:57,880 --> 00:01:00,550
Still.
I find myself incredibly torn about this

21
00:01:00,551 --> 00:01:03,310
topic on one hand until the last couple 
months,

22
00:01:03,311 --> 00:01:06,190
we hadn't even diagnosed the problem of 
the regressive left,

23
00:01:06,191 --> 00:01:07,024
right?
Clearly huge numbers of those of you on 

24
00:01:09,821 --> 00:01:12,700
the left were upset about how your team 
was being hijacked,

25
00:01:12,701 --> 00:01:15,160
but there wasn't a place to come 
together and talk about it,

26
00:01:15,550 --> 00:01:16,383
much less a whole group of likeminded 
people willing to share their 

27
00:01:18,701 --> 00:01:21,520
experiences and tell their stories.
For that reason,

28
00:01:21,521 --> 00:01:23,560
I've wanted to keep this conversation 
going.

29
00:01:24,010 --> 00:01:27,100
It's important to realize how many of us
are actually out there.

30
00:01:27,130 --> 00:01:31,660
There are a lot we want to fix the left,
but I don't think we can without getting

31
00:01:31,661 --> 00:01:35,230
to critical mass on the issue.
On the other hand,

32
00:01:35,231 --> 00:01:38,470
I don't sense that we can actually 
change these regressives.

33
00:01:38,470 --> 00:01:41,500
As I've also mentioned before,
since we've started doing the show,

34
00:01:41,740 --> 00:01:42,573
I've seen these guys continue to lie and
smear opponents only to be caught and 

35
00:01:46,361 --> 00:01:47,194
then doubled down or even more.
Some people are fighting back against 

36
00:01:49,721 --> 00:01:52,630
these lies with facts and logic.
Fortunately,

37
00:01:52,631 --> 00:01:54,280
I've had several of these people on the 
show,

38
00:01:54,281 --> 00:01:55,990
like my new eyes,
Sarah Hater,

39
00:01:55,991 --> 00:01:59,290
and God said,
others I know only from the online space

40
00:01:59,291 --> 00:02:02,080
such as my guest this week,
Ali Rizvi Ali's,

41
00:02:02,081 --> 00:02:02,914
an atheist Muslim who's constantly 
writing about and fighting against 

42
00:02:06,581 --> 00:02:07,414
regressive ideology growing up mainly in
Saudi Arabia and ultimately leaving 

43
00:02:11,021 --> 00:02:15,310
religion for secularism.
He should be a natural hero of the left.

44
00:02:15,790 --> 00:02:17,890
Sadly,
he's not a.

45
00:02:17,950 --> 00:02:20,020
that's one of the many things that we're
going to talk about.

46
00:02:20,170 --> 00:02:23,410
I go back and forth between thinking 
that fighting the regressives by putting

47
00:02:23,411 --> 00:02:24,244
time and energy into discussing them is 
what will ultimately do the most to 

48
00:02:27,041 --> 00:02:27,874
change the landscape of the left and 
then just thinking that if we ignore 

49
00:02:30,761 --> 00:02:32,050
them,
maybe they'll go away.

50
00:02:32,410 --> 00:02:33,243
I tend to think that most of you will 
tell me that we have to keep amplifying 

51
00:02:36,251 --> 00:02:41,110
real liberal voices and that by ignoring
them will only let their influence grow.

52
00:02:41,380 --> 00:02:42,213
That's pretty much what I think too.
I must say that I'm incredibly inspired 

53
00:02:45,611 --> 00:02:49,540
by the fact that half the time when I 
see anything that they write,

54
00:02:49,570 --> 00:02:50,403
tweet or whatever,
there's an army of people ready to 

55
00:02:52,991 --> 00:02:53,824
combat their bullshit.
A few people have mentioned to me that 

56
00:02:55,871 --> 00:02:56,704
they believe that this whole regressive 
situation and the fuel it gives to the 

57
00:02:59,921 --> 00:03:02,800
right is only gonna get worse before it 
gets better.

58
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:03,933
Unfortunately,
I think these people are probably 

59
00:03:05,441 --> 00:03:08,110
correct until the real,
legitimate,

60
00:03:08,111 --> 00:03:11,110
true voices of liberalism can come back 
to the forefront.

61
00:03:11,140 --> 00:03:11,973
This conversation is always going to be 
stuck between the regressives and the 

62
00:03:15,221 --> 00:03:17,620
trumps.
It looks like we've got our work cut out

63
00:03:17,621 --> 00:03:22,621
for us for 2016.
My guest this week is Ali Rizvi.

64
00:03:23,090 --> 00:03:25,930
Allie writes for the Huffington Post and
his first book,

65
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:26,793
the atheist Muslim losing my religion,
but not my identity is being published 

66
00:03:31,241 --> 00:03:32,074
in 2016.
He's a strong advocate for the 

67
00:03:33,971 --> 00:03:37,600
advancement of secularism and science,
particularly in the Muslim world.

68
00:03:37,930 --> 00:03:38,980
Allie,
welcome to the show.

69
00:03:39,750 --> 00:03:40,151
Uh,
Dave,

70
00:03:40,151 --> 00:03:40,984
glad to be on.

71
00:03:41,330 --> 00:03:42,163
So we've been doing this as I start 
almost all my shows by saying that the 

72
00:03:45,141 --> 00:03:45,974
guests,
we've been doing this on twitter for a 

73
00:03:46,981 --> 00:03:51,170
while and you are another one of these 
anti regressive warriors.

74
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:53,600
So I'm happy that you're joining me this
week.

75
00:03:54,430 --> 00:03:55,070
Yeah,
you can,

76
00:03:55,070 --> 00:03:57,400
you can't help but be.
I mean it's just uh,

77
00:03:57,780 --> 00:04:00,450
doing anything like this.
It's almost synonymous.

78
00:04:00,730 --> 00:04:01,540
Yeah,
it,

79
00:04:01,540 --> 00:04:02,770
it absolutely is.
So.

80
00:04:02,771 --> 00:04:03,430
All right,
we're gonna.

81
00:04:03,430 --> 00:04:04,263
We're gonna.
Talk a little bit about the regressives 

82
00:04:05,261 --> 00:04:06,310
of course,
but let's,

83
00:04:06,340 --> 00:04:07,173
let's talk about you first.
I want people to understand sort of who 

84
00:04:09,101 --> 00:04:11,050
you are,
where you come from a,

85
00:04:11,060 --> 00:04:15,310
you spent most of your youth up until 
your early teens in Saudi Arabia.

86
00:04:15,311 --> 00:04:16,144
Is that right?

87
00:04:16,390 --> 00:04:17,071
Right.
I did.

88
00:04:17,071 --> 00:04:17,904
So I pretty much grew up there.
I was born and then after that we moved 

89
00:04:21,401 --> 00:04:24,430
to Tripoli in Libya.
Lived there for several years and then I

90
00:04:24,431 --> 00:04:27,730
went to Saudi Arabia where I was 
actually until high school.

91
00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:29,133
And then after that I went back to 
Boston again for a university and then 

92
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:37,390
came to Canada.
So why were you bouncing around so much?

93
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:42,500
My parents are professors and they liked
going in different places and they,

94
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:43,473
they,
you know,

95
00:04:43,570 --> 00:04:46,090
they got really good job.
Offers are both very,

96
00:04:46,091 --> 00:04:49,210
very competent and uh,
so they've traveled all over the place.

97
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:51,670
Yeah.
So those are just the countries we lived

98
00:04:51,671 --> 00:04:53,800
in and you know,
we used to visit all over the place.

99
00:04:53,801 --> 00:04:54,634
So just generally when it comes to North
Africa and the Middle East and South 

100
00:04:57,720 --> 00:05:00,460
Asia seen a lot of places growing up.

101
00:05:00,930 --> 00:05:03,150
Well interestingly,
all three of those,

102
00:05:03,151 --> 00:05:03,984
particularly Pakistan and Libya are 
probably extremely different now than 

103
00:05:07,651 --> 00:05:09,090
they were when you were there.

104
00:05:10,180 --> 00:05:11,900
Olivia.
I don't have too many.

105
00:05:11,901 --> 00:05:15,200
I mean that's when we lived there when I
was a kid,

106
00:05:15,590 --> 00:05:17,870
so I don't have,
I do have strong memories of it,

107
00:05:18,290 --> 00:05:19,123
but uh,
they're probably not representative at 

108
00:05:20,601 --> 00:05:21,434
all by the way it is right now.
And in Pakistan is also very different 

109
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:28,640
than it used to be and I haven't been 
there for a while now.

110
00:05:28,641 --> 00:05:30,200
I can't go there.
So.

111
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:31,440
Right.
So,

112
00:05:31,441 --> 00:05:32,274
uh,
we'll talk about why you can't go there 

113
00:05:33,151 --> 00:05:33,984
in a little bit,
but let's talk about Saudi Arabia for a 

114
00:05:35,751 --> 00:05:36,584
bit because it's such an important 
player in world politics and its 

115
00:05:40,261 --> 00:05:41,094
relationship to the United States.
And I feel like people actually know 

116
00:05:44,011 --> 00:05:47,730
very little about Saudi Arabia,
the nature of our relationship.

117
00:05:47,940 --> 00:05:48,773
What was it like growing up there?
Your parents as professors obviously 

118
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:54,660
came from the,
I'm assuming that was middle class,

119
00:05:54,661 --> 00:05:56,480
sort of educated middle class.
Well,

120
00:05:56,510 --> 00:05:57,950
how did that relate to

121
00:05:58,290 --> 00:06:01,790
religion and secularism and all that?
It was,

122
00:06:01,791 --> 00:06:03,350
um,
it was,

123
00:06:03,490 --> 00:06:04,323
it was complicated.
So the way I describe it as my own 

124
00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:11,510
nuclear family,
like my parents and my siblings are sort

125
00:06:11,511 --> 00:06:15,680
of a liberal,
progressive type of Shia Muslim family.

126
00:06:16,130 --> 00:06:16,963
And so we had that.
And then outside that I was in the 

127
00:06:19,700 --> 00:06:20,533
private American school,
the American International School in 

128
00:06:22,131 --> 00:06:23,240
Riyadh,
the time.

129
00:06:23,241 --> 00:06:26,480
So the school was obviously,
it was American,

130
00:06:26,481 --> 00:06:30,100
so we had an American textbooks.
We listen to American music and uh,

131
00:06:30,101 --> 00:06:31,040
you know,
I mean it wasn't,

132
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:32,113
it was an American school but had people
from about 80 different nationalities 

133
00:06:34,131 --> 00:06:36,710
that.
So it was a truly international school,

134
00:06:36,950 --> 00:06:39,080
um,
and then the,

135
00:06:39,081 --> 00:06:40,760
um,
outside of that,

136
00:06:40,820 --> 00:06:42,290
when we stepped out of that,
it was,

137
00:06:42,650 --> 00:06:43,820
you know,
cover your hair.

138
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:46,160
Women can't drive,
you know,

139
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:49,610
five times prayer and if you're outside 
during the prayer,

140
00:06:49,611 --> 00:06:50,444
you know,
you'll get caught by one of the baton 

141
00:06:52,380 --> 00:06:54,200
was they call them,
which is the religious police.

142
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:59,570
So it was strange seeing all of these 
three things.

143
00:06:59,870 --> 00:07:00,950
But when,
you know,

144
00:07:00,951 --> 00:07:04,730
when you're growing up with something as
a kid that is normal for you,

145
00:07:05,090 --> 00:07:05,923
that's what you think everything's like.
So I actually think that it was a good 

146
00:07:10,311 --> 00:07:14,420
thing to be exposed to all of those 
worlds at the same time.

147
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:17,350
So I was uh,
you know,

148
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:18,290
when,
for instance,

149
00:07:18,291 --> 00:07:20,100
when nine slash 11 happened,
uh,

150
00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:20,940
I could,
you know,

151
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:21,773
the Saudis coming in from there.
And I remember the mentality that there 

152
00:07:24,741 --> 00:07:25,574
was,
there was one thing I described in my 

153
00:07:27,261 --> 00:07:28,094
book is a,
when I was in fifth grade at the 

154
00:07:29,841 --> 00:07:30,674
American school,
we'd made paper snowflakes out of you 

155
00:07:34,730 --> 00:07:39,730
fold up a piece of paper,
you cut snowflakes and we decorated them

156
00:07:39,891 --> 00:07:42,110
with glue and glitter and our names.
And we were happy,

157
00:07:42,111 --> 00:07:45,290
I was about 10 years old and uh,
it was,

158
00:07:45,291 --> 00:07:46,124
even though it was an American school,
the Saudi Ministry of Education used to 

159
00:07:49,701 --> 00:07:54,701
send an inspector once in a while to 
make sure everything's okay,

160
00:07:54,891 --> 00:07:56,990
everything's going according to the 
rules.

161
00:07:57,350 --> 00:08:01,610
And he came in and he actually cut the 
tips off of each of the snowflakes,

162
00:08:02,570 --> 00:08:07,490
was very angry and cut them off and we 
asked our teacher what was going on so I

163
00:08:07,491 --> 00:08:08,324
can know what is this.
And then she told us about the Star of 

164
00:08:09,770 --> 00:08:14,770
David and why we can everything that has
six points that sort of symbolizes that.

165
00:08:15,420 --> 00:08:18,050
And that was our whole class of 10 year 
olds.

166
00:08:18,051 --> 00:08:21,710
That was our introduction,
at least my introduction to the Jews.

167
00:08:22,610 --> 00:08:23,301
Right.
So,

168
00:08:23,301 --> 00:08:24,134
um,
and this was just a spot check from an 

169
00:08:27,921 --> 00:08:29,890
inspector,
but their kids,

170
00:08:29,891 --> 00:08:31,400
it's hard to will go to the Saudi 
schools.

171
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:32,593
They have the stuff in their textbooks.
The guy who did that spot check for us 

172
00:08:36,230 --> 00:08:37,063
was actually,
he actually writes the curriculum for 

173
00:08:39,141 --> 00:08:42,560
the rest of them.
So when nine slash 11 happened and I saw

174
00:08:42,561 --> 00:08:43,394
that kind of culture,
those people coming in from there and 

175
00:08:46,281 --> 00:08:49,020
then the people in my school,
like the Americans,

176
00:08:50,010 --> 00:08:51,390
they're the ones being attacked over 
here.

177
00:08:51,391 --> 00:08:52,224
It was,
it was really strange seeing it because 

178
00:08:53,691 --> 00:08:57,120
I've kind of grown up with both sides in
parallel,

179
00:08:57,170 --> 00:08:58,003
you know,
the,

180
00:08:58,130 --> 00:08:58,963
and all my teachers were American and a 
lot of my friends were from the US and 

181
00:09:01,321 --> 00:09:02,820
Canada.
On the other hand,

182
00:09:02,821 --> 00:09:05,730
the company I was living in was a place 
while the hijackers came from.

183
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:08,070
So at fifth grade.
So you're probably,

184
00:09:08,071 --> 00:09:11,040
I guess that's about 11 years old or so.
Um,

185
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:15,420
was that sort of,
were your secular awakening?

186
00:09:15,460 --> 00:09:16,770
Was,
was happening,

187
00:09:16,771 --> 00:09:20,400
is that the time of that or how 
religious was your family?

188
00:09:20,401 --> 00:09:21,234
Were you,
were you guys away from it already or 

189
00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:24,653
break that down for me?

190
00:09:25,070 --> 00:09:26,040
Well,
my family was,

191
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:28,850
my family was sort of liberal,
religious.

192
00:09:28,851 --> 00:09:29,720
I mean,
there were Muslim,

193
00:09:30,460 --> 00:09:32,510
they were believing Muslims.
We used to go through the,

194
00:09:32,780 --> 00:09:34,500
you know,
we did the Ramadan thing.

195
00:09:34,501 --> 00:09:37,500
We used to go where she,
we to do tomorrow morning.

196
00:09:37,870 --> 00:09:40,380
Uh,
my parents used to prey on and off,

197
00:09:40,770 --> 00:09:44,280
but usually they made it to like two or 
three times a day on average.

198
00:09:44,710 --> 00:09:45,281
Um,
so,

199
00:09:45,281 --> 00:09:45,850
you know,
they were,

200
00:09:45,850 --> 00:09:46,683
there must be an interesting diagram of 
people praying and then the sort of 

201
00:09:49,121 --> 00:09:51,070
dropoff as it gets later in the day.
Right.

202
00:09:51,190 --> 00:09:51,801
There is,
I,

203
00:09:51,801 --> 00:09:53,740
I don't know,
a lot of them Muslims,

204
00:09:53,741 --> 00:09:55,810
you actually believe pray five times a 
day.

205
00:09:55,811 --> 00:09:58,510
Every time I watch TV and uh,
it's,

206
00:09:58,990 --> 00:10:00,850
you know,
this is a slight tangent,

207
00:10:00,851 --> 00:10:02,110
but every time you know,
you google,

208
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:04,090
North American,
Muslim or American Muslim,

209
00:10:04,750 --> 00:10:08,200
you'll get a whole picture of people 
with head scarves and you know,

210
00:10:08,201 --> 00:10:11,470
people in mosques and so on.
But they're just,

211
00:10:11,471 --> 00:10:15,240
as a representative of us Muslims is,
as you know,

212
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:19,360
any modes and group care and Islam or 
not,

213
00:10:19,980 --> 00:10:20,813
what is exactly why we should all be 
talking to people like you more because 

214
00:10:23,551 --> 00:10:27,360
I have no faith that the media is giving
us examples of any,

215
00:10:27,361 --> 00:10:28,560
forget religion,
ethnicity,

216
00:10:28,561 --> 00:10:29,394
whatever it is.
The media gives us such bad examples of 

217
00:10:30,601 --> 00:10:33,840
everybody that that's why we have to 
talk to the outliers.

218
00:10:33,841 --> 00:10:34,530
Right.

219
00:10:34,530 --> 00:10:38,230
And you understand it in a way,
and I'm sorry we're going away from your

220
00:10:38,231 --> 00:10:39,220
original question.
That's fine.

221
00:10:39,221 --> 00:10:40,370
That's fine.
Yeah,

222
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:42,400
I understand it in a way because you 
know,

223
00:10:42,730 --> 00:10:43,870
for instance,
if there's something,

224
00:10:43,871 --> 00:10:44,704
some story relating to Christianity,
you're not exactly going to call it 

225
00:10:48,140 --> 00:10:51,950
pastor or you know,
somebody who's a was a,

226
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:54,470
a priest or something like that is an 
expert in Christianity.

227
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:58,210
But um,
the thing with Muslims as it's different

228
00:10:58,211 --> 00:11:00,100
when you think Jerry Seinfeld with David
Letterman,

229
00:11:00,101 --> 00:11:02,900
you don't think jus right?
But with right,

230
00:11:02,970 --> 00:11:05,510
well I don't think letterman's Jewish,
but I think either way

231
00:11:05,900 --> 00:11:08,840
I thought he was a comedian so it's 
close enough.

232
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:11,210
Comedian is a whole different.
That's a separate.

233
00:11:11,810 --> 00:11:15,320
I think that's another thing.
But um,

234
00:11:15,420 --> 00:11:16,253
you know,
when you,

235
00:11:16,370 --> 00:11:17,480
when,
when it comes to Muslims,

236
00:11:17,481 --> 00:11:19,430
I mean Dave Chappelle,
Dr Oz,

237
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:21,470
Shaq o'neal,
like all of these guys.

238
00:11:21,471 --> 00:11:26,471
I mean these are people who are Muslim,
but that's not who you say that,

239
00:11:26,970 --> 00:11:27,803
that's not the representation.
Even though they're right here in front 

240
00:11:29,401 --> 00:11:30,250
of our faces.
So when,

241
00:11:30,260 --> 00:11:32,490
when you see it on tv,
it's always the one with the headscarf.

242
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,820
Every,
almost every non Muslim I know who works

243
00:11:35,821 --> 00:11:38,310
with the Muslim of work has gone for a 
beer with them afterwards.

244
00:11:38,570 --> 00:11:39,403
You know,
a lot of people have dated Muslim girls 

245
00:11:40,801 --> 00:11:43,740
and they've very few of them actually 
wear the headscarf.

246
00:11:43,741 --> 00:11:44,540
But

247
00:11:44,540 --> 00:11:45,410
I'm pretty sure if,
uh,

248
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:49,370
if Shaq was the main representative for 
Muslim,

249
00:11:49,371 --> 00:11:51,320
things would be extremely different 
right now.

250
00:11:51,590 --> 00:11:54,520
You wouldn't,
they probably probably for the better.

251
00:11:54,790 --> 00:11:56,190
Um,
so,

252
00:11:56,230 --> 00:11:58,060
so tell me a little more.
So your family.

253
00:11:58,061 --> 00:12:00,490
So you guys were sort of religious but 
not that religious.

254
00:12:00,700 --> 00:12:01,533
You were getting some of this at school,
but that was obviously Americanized a 

255
00:12:04,870 --> 00:12:05,120
right.

256
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:06,680
Keep going.
I mean,

257
00:12:06,830 --> 00:12:08,390
my,
my main,

258
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:12,590
the first time is truly skeptical of 
that religion.

259
00:12:12,591 --> 00:12:13,424
And God was when I was five years old 
and I actually had a cousin and she was 

260
00:12:17,391 --> 00:12:22,391
three and this is said that she lived in
London and she had childhood leukemia.

261
00:12:22,641 --> 00:12:23,130
So,
you know,

262
00:12:23,130 --> 00:12:24,530
she was close to my age.
I was five.

263
00:12:24,531 --> 00:12:25,240
She was three,
you know,

264
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:28,750
we were playmates and uh,
when she was dying,

265
00:12:28,780 --> 00:12:32,750
everybody who came into the room,
so this was like an art in the culture,

266
00:12:32,751 --> 00:12:33,584
you know,
last moments every once in those kids 

267
00:12:35,330 --> 00:12:39,590
where they're there and it's a,
if you know what a child's death,

268
00:12:39,610 --> 00:12:42,200
especially from cancer,
it's absolutely horrific.

269
00:12:42,630 --> 00:12:43,463
So cancer doesn't discriminate.
Same amount of pain and adult fields is 

270
00:12:45,891 --> 00:12:46,724
what a three year old child would feel.
So print at that time there wasn't 

271
00:12:50,031 --> 00:12:54,590
really any good cure for childhood,
acute lymphoblastic leukemia either.

272
00:12:54,890 --> 00:12:55,723
So at that point my mother and my aunt 
were praying and crying and I was 

273
00:13:00,981 --> 00:13:03,020
standing there with my father and I 
asked my father,

274
00:13:03,021 --> 00:13:03,500
I'm like,
you know,

275
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:04,333
what's going on?
And I was watching her in pain and he 

276
00:13:06,531 --> 00:13:09,180
said that God's taking her back,
you know,

277
00:13:09,190 --> 00:13:12,500
God's taking her to a better place and 
keeping her with him.

278
00:13:13,220 --> 00:13:14,150
So I'm thinking,
okay,

279
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:15,033
that's not such a bad thing.
So why are they crying and why they 

280
00:13:17,490 --> 00:13:18,930
praying so hard and they're like,
they're,

281
00:13:18,931 --> 00:13:21,170
they're begging God not to take her 
away.

282
00:13:21,770 --> 00:13:23,480
They want him to,
you know,

283
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:24,353
like stop the pain or not take away and 
to me like in my mind we used to play 

284
00:13:28,071 --> 00:13:31,580
tug of war at school,
so I was thinking of the tug of war game

285
00:13:31,581 --> 00:13:32,414
where there's this God who's all 
powerful apparently and we're on the 

286
00:13:34,881 --> 00:13:35,714
other end and we're pulling it.
It just seemed like a very sadistic 

287
00:13:39,740 --> 00:13:40,573
thing to do.

288
00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:42,473
It also,
it also sounds like such a losing 

289
00:13:44,161 --> 00:13:47,740
proposition if you're the believer,
so if in this case your,

290
00:13:47,770 --> 00:13:48,630
your,
your father,

291
00:13:48,631 --> 00:13:49,464
assuming he was a believer or or that 
maybe he was just playing the role as a 

292
00:13:51,931 --> 00:13:52,764
father,
but it's a losing proposition if you 

293
00:13:54,451 --> 00:13:55,284
pretty much know medically that the 
child is not going to make it and yet 

294
00:13:58,921 --> 00:13:59,754
you have these people praying and you 
know the outcome is pretty much in 

295
00:14:03,631 --> 00:14:04,464
front.
What are you actually saying about 

296
00:14:05,761 --> 00:14:07,770
prayer is also an interesting angle.

297
00:14:07,970 --> 00:14:08,803
I mean that's the other thing.
I think that if the of God is all 

298
00:14:10,701 --> 00:14:12,620
powerful and there's a three year old 
kid in pain,

299
00:14:12,621 --> 00:14:14,660
you don't find.
I understand,

300
00:14:14,661 --> 00:14:16,710
you know,
you have to take the kid back then don't

301
00:14:16,780 --> 00:14:17,613
like don't draw it out,
don't drop the agony cause of cancer 

302
00:14:20,301 --> 00:14:22,160
deaths are terrible.
We,

303
00:14:22,161 --> 00:14:25,390
you know,
at that point that the clarity of a five

304
00:14:25,391 --> 00:14:26,224
year old mind,
I obviously that I remember this very 

305
00:14:27,651 --> 00:14:28,484
clearly.
It's one of my earliest strongest 

306
00:14:29,811 --> 00:14:31,820
memories just because of the intensity 
of it.

307
00:14:32,390 --> 00:14:33,980
And after that I thought it was like,
okay,

308
00:14:34,310 --> 00:14:37,460
nobody's really going to be happy with 
this God character anymore,

309
00:14:37,490 --> 00:14:41,180
but the next week or every ritual,
everything got was a hero.

310
00:14:41,780 --> 00:14:43,520
You know,
everyone who's continued praying to him.

311
00:14:43,521 --> 00:14:47,190
So it didn't make a lot of sense to me.
And then after that I thought I was like

312
00:14:47,210 --> 00:14:48,230
maybe,
well all these guys,

313
00:14:48,231 --> 00:14:49,064
you know,
all the adults grown ups think it makes 

314
00:14:49,911 --> 00:14:50,200
sense.

315
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:51,033
Or maybe I'm the WHO's crazy,
but then I'd see I'd watched TV and 

316
00:14:54,620 --> 00:14:56,790
there'd be a disaster,
natural disaster,

317
00:14:56,791 --> 00:15:01,791
a tornado or a flood or something,
and the lone survivor or two would say,

318
00:15:02,940 --> 00:15:04,520
no,
I'm God bless.

319
00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:07,240
God saved me.
I'm so thankful to God knows.

320
00:15:07,340 --> 00:15:09,680
I'd always think know what did the other
people do,

321
00:15:09,940 --> 00:15:10,773
so as a kid it was always there and then
I dabbled in and out of being religious 

322
00:15:16,251 --> 00:15:19,410
to some extent,
like whenever had exams final.

323
00:15:19,570 --> 00:15:20,940
Is that.
Well,

324
00:15:21,010 --> 00:15:23,130
that's where the prayer would kick in.
Yeah.

325
00:15:23,170 --> 00:15:24,003
So it was,
it was like my cousin used to call the 

326
00:15:25,291 --> 00:15:28,400
bing God reviving God.
He was a very religious guy.

327
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:30,513
God probably took your brides.
I'm guessing you were pretty good 

328
00:15:32,021 --> 00:15:32,790
student.

329
00:15:32,790 --> 00:15:35,320
Yeah.
It turned out that I was fairly.

330
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,090
Yeah,
I did well in school.

331
00:15:37,091 --> 00:15:40,090
Like I did,
turned out whether I prayed or not.

332
00:15:40,150 --> 00:15:40,983
God somehow was okay with me.
But all those kids with HIV in Africa 

333
00:15:44,410 --> 00:15:46,140
somehow.
Yeah,

334
00:15:46,150 --> 00:15:51,150
just somehow my grades were okay.
But HIV for the kids in Africa,

335
00:15:52,020 --> 00:15:52,853
not so much.

336
00:15:53,470 --> 00:15:54,071
Alright.
So you,

337
00:15:54,071 --> 00:15:57,070
you have this awakening and it,
and it's happening now where,

338
00:15:57,071 --> 00:15:57,904
where was the full,
sort of more adult version of your 

339
00:16:00,711 --> 00:16:01,544
awakening?
Were you still in Saudi Arabia or was 

340
00:16:02,451 --> 00:16:03,420
that,
uh,

341
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:04,310
when you had left already?

342
00:16:04,890 --> 00:16:05,670
I had,
I had,

343
00:16:05,670 --> 00:16:07,340
I had left.
I had gone,

344
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:10,640
gone to medical school at that point in 
Pakistan.

345
00:16:10,641 --> 00:16:12,200
I finished,
I'd completed it,

346
00:16:12,710 --> 00:16:17,710
and towards the end of it I had a 
actually really started reading.

347
00:16:18,570 --> 00:16:19,970
Um,
the,

348
00:16:20,610 --> 00:16:21,443
uh,
well I'd started reading the Scripture 

349
00:16:22,311 --> 00:16:24,110
and everything,
the Koran when I was much younger,

350
00:16:24,350 --> 00:16:28,970
but I think when the internet came 
around and I wanted to do more research,

351
00:16:28,971 --> 00:16:32,550
I was able to find more things.
So this was around 99 or something.

352
00:16:32,551 --> 00:16:35,820
I was already in my twenties.
I'm a,

353
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:38,070
I'm a little up there.
So yeah.

354
00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:39,820
So I started,
uh,

355
00:16:39,850 --> 00:16:41,540
you know,
when I actually started reading it,

356
00:16:41,570 --> 00:16:44,240
then when people got more and more 
defensive about it,

357
00:16:44,570 --> 00:16:45,800
the more I talked to,
especially in practice,

358
00:16:45,801 --> 00:16:49,070
then when you talk to people,
they give you all of these responses.

359
00:16:49,580 --> 00:16:49,941
Like,
you know,

360
00:16:49,941 --> 00:16:51,500
those aren't true,
Muslims are,

361
00:16:51,501 --> 00:16:52,334
you know,
this is sort of a bit of peace or that 

362
00:16:54,350 --> 00:16:55,183
thing that you're recording from the 
crime that's mistranslated or 

363
00:16:57,860 --> 00:17:02,480
misinterpreted or it's a metaphor or 
whatever the excuse was gonna.

364
00:17:02,620 --> 00:17:06,440
Eventually it started seeing through it 
and then I think it was actually one day

365
00:17:06,441 --> 00:17:07,280
when it hit me.
I'm like,

366
00:17:07,310 --> 00:17:09,410
this,
I shouldn't have given considering this.

367
00:17:09,411 --> 00:17:12,350
I mean,
this is a guy lived inside a fish.

368
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:13,353
You know,
there's,

369
00:17:13,730 --> 00:17:18,730
it says it says in its.
I'd hear that in the Koran.

370
00:17:20,150 --> 00:17:21,470
For me it was a karate for a lot of 
people.

371
00:17:21,471 --> 00:17:22,580
It's a bible and everything,
but

372
00:17:23,350 --> 00:17:24,183
by the way,
we should note that they're all equally 

373
00:17:25,361 --> 00:17:26,194
crazy.
There's plenty of evil stuff and all of 

374
00:17:27,881 --> 00:17:29,190
them we want,
you know,

375
00:17:29,230 --> 00:17:31,810
we want to be good liberals here,
so let's not pile on one right.

376
00:17:31,811 --> 00:17:35,110
There is plenty of awful stuff in the 
Old Testament.

377
00:17:35,610 --> 00:17:36,260
Sure.

378
00:17:36,260 --> 00:17:40,290
They always say that if Moses hadn't 
hallucinated up the Old Testament,

379
00:17:40,291 --> 00:17:42,650
then you know,
Muhammad couldn't have plagiarized it.

380
00:17:43,890 --> 00:17:47,550
It is an and there's a lot of 
similarities as a no pork.

381
00:17:47,770 --> 00:17:50,010
There's no for,
for miles,

382
00:17:50,010 --> 00:17:50,843
there's a Shalom and Salaam and then 
both of their nicknames are mow it in a 

383
00:17:55,531 --> 00:17:56,740
way.
There's a,

384
00:17:56,990 --> 00:17:58,920
you know,
there are a lot of similarities between,

385
00:17:58,921 --> 00:18:01,950
especially between Judaism and Islam and
the violence and the books.

386
00:18:01,951 --> 00:18:03,300
It's absolutely.
I mean that's a,

387
00:18:03,350 --> 00:18:05,340
that's an obvious thing,
but I used to think of like,

388
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:09,300
what are you doing when people would 
quote a 4:34

389
00:18:09,301 --> 00:18:10,134
which says that you can beat your wife 
if your disobedience as a last resort 

390
00:18:14,130 --> 00:18:16,620
and they justify it now like,
well no,

391
00:18:16,621 --> 00:18:18,930
it actually means this or it's only as a
last resort.

392
00:18:18,931 --> 00:18:19,950
And I used to think,
I'm like,

393
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:25,400
if I had written this in my book and the
book came out last week,

394
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:27,113
you guys would be killing me for this.
I mean there's the word you wouldn't be 

395
00:18:29,731 --> 00:18:30,564
looking for context.
You wouldn't be looking at alternative 

396
00:18:31,981 --> 00:18:32,814
interpretations.
That's a luxury that we only afford two 

397
00:18:35,700 --> 00:18:39,060
holy books and we don't read Alice in 
wonderland that way.

398
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:42,100
So you know,
the and the,

399
00:18:42,250 --> 00:18:43,290
you know,
people like,

400
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:45,330
for example,
Reza and so on will be like,

401
00:18:45,710 --> 00:18:46,650
no,
this is,

402
00:18:46,980 --> 00:18:47,813
we should not read this.
Literally like the worst thing is that 

403
00:18:50,551 --> 00:18:51,810
people will read it.
Literally.

404
00:18:51,811 --> 00:18:52,920
I was actually on a,
on a show.

405
00:18:52,921 --> 00:18:53,754
I was on the agenda with Steve here in 
Toronto and I was sitting next to 

406
00:18:57,811 --> 00:18:59,970
Shabbir Ali,
who who's an Islamic scholar,

407
00:19:00,420 --> 00:19:02,310
and at one point he actually said,
he's like,

408
00:19:02,340 --> 00:19:04,950
look,
people misquote the Koran by quoting it.

409
00:19:04,951 --> 00:19:08,160
Literally.
I was just thinking that that was one of

410
00:19:08,161 --> 00:19:10,770
the most amazing sentences,
if that's a great quote right there.

411
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:13,950
He's a great guy.
But he said it and I used to think,

412
00:19:13,951 --> 00:19:16,410
I'm like,
I understand why they're so terrified of

413
00:19:16,411 --> 00:19:18,500
people quoting it.
Literally any script,

414
00:19:19,050 --> 00:19:21,390
because it's terrifying.
If you could,

415
00:19:21,450 --> 00:19:25,230
if you quote those words exactly the way
that they're written are exactly the way

416
00:19:25,231 --> 00:19:28,130
they were said by God,
apparently a,

417
00:19:28,140 --> 00:19:31,560
then it's a terrifying thing,
you know.

418
00:19:31,590 --> 00:19:32,570
So they say,
well,

419
00:19:32,590 --> 00:19:33,423
you have to look at the interpreters and
the scholars and then you listen to the 

420
00:19:36,211 --> 00:19:38,220
scholars and they're saying these human 
beings,

421
00:19:38,221 --> 00:19:39,054
their explanations of what's God,
when God's word is actually means more 

422
00:19:43,290 --> 00:19:48,120
than what God's word is itself,
which again doesn't make any sense,

423
00:19:48,121 --> 00:19:51,670
and Isis and al Qaeda and the Taliban,
um,

424
00:19:51,930 --> 00:19:54,120
these are these people.
They're not quoting scholars.

425
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:56,120
I mean they're,
they're quoting scripture.

426
00:19:56,121 --> 00:19:57,540
And recording the deed.

427
00:19:57,840 --> 00:19:58,673
Yeah.
You know,

428
00:19:59,030 --> 00:20:02,880
after the Paris attacks,
I got into it on twitter with one of my,

429
00:20:02,910 --> 00:20:05,790
one of my friends on the left who were 
immediately was,

430
00:20:05,791 --> 00:20:07,800
you know,
with within wild the thing I think while

431
00:20:07,801 --> 00:20:08,634
the event was still happening,
so literally they hadn't caught anybody 

432
00:20:11,011 --> 00:20:11,844
yet.
I mean there were bodies still on the 

433
00:20:12,721 --> 00:20:13,554
floor at the theater.
He immediately went to the American 

434
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:17,273
foreign policy stuff and then a few 
minutes after that they released the 

435
00:20:20,521 --> 00:20:23,310
guys who did it.
Isis actually released the statement and

436
00:20:23,311 --> 00:20:25,980
there was a ton of scripture in there.
And I said,

437
00:20:25,981 --> 00:20:27,510
well,
what do you think about this?

438
00:20:27,690 --> 00:20:31,380
And then the conversation sort of 
dwindled off into nothing and I.

439
00:20:31,430 --> 00:20:34,860
and I think that's part of what this 
whole schism here on the left that we've

440
00:20:34,861 --> 00:20:37,560
been talking so much about is related 
to,

441
00:20:37,740 --> 00:20:39,360
you know,
like it's scripture,

442
00:20:39,361 --> 00:20:43,080
it's written word that somebody is 
believing and taking into action.

443
00:20:43,350 --> 00:20:47,230
And then also there's a lot of messed up
foreign policy stuff by every country in

444
00:20:47,231 --> 00:20:47,570
the world.

445
00:20:47,570 --> 00:20:48,200
Yeah.
I

446
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:50,420
always find it.
I find it interesting that whenever I'm,

447
00:20:50,450 --> 00:20:52,780
I'm debating or I'm having a discussion 
with anybody,

448
00:20:52,790 --> 00:20:53,623
usually if it's someone who is moderate 
or someone or an academic or someone 

449
00:20:57,741 --> 00:20:58,574
else in Islamic studies for instance,
they don't want to talk about the 

450
00:21:01,041 --> 00:21:01,940
scripture and they're like,
well,

451
00:21:01,941 --> 00:21:02,774
come on,
let's just not talk about the scripture 

452
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:04,850
as if it's sort of beneath them.
It's like,

453
00:21:04,851 --> 00:21:05,684
you know,
we're going to talk about the social 

454
00:21:06,651 --> 00:21:08,030
logical implications with this.
You know,

455
00:21:08,031 --> 00:21:08,864
how does religion workout is ideal 
identity formation and all of these 

456
00:21:11,301 --> 00:21:12,830
other things,
economics and so on.

457
00:21:13,250 --> 00:21:15,920
But whenever I talked to a guy with a 
beard,

458
00:21:16,070 --> 00:21:16,903
you know,
someone who's more of a fundamentalist 

459
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:22,910
and I like at times I'll sit and I said 
this on the show to Shabbir Ali too.

460
00:21:22,911 --> 00:21:23,271
I was like,
well,

461
00:21:23,271 --> 00:21:24,830
let's not get into the whole scripture 
thing,

462
00:21:25,310 --> 00:21:27,090
but they almost always turned around and
say,

463
00:21:27,091 --> 00:21:28,400
no,
that's what's important.

464
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:33,640
That's what religion is.
So the people who are actually believing

465
00:21:34,011 --> 00:21:39,011
it and going along with the tenants of 
it and actually following the example of

466
00:21:40,611 --> 00:21:41,444
the prophet and so on.
These are people who actually take 

467
00:21:43,251 --> 00:21:46,430
scripture very,
very seriously at the rest of the people

468
00:21:46,460 --> 00:21:47,293
don't and I think it's because there is 
an element of rationality and then they 

469
00:21:51,501 --> 00:21:52,580
just can't believe.
They're like,

470
00:21:52,581 --> 00:21:53,420
okay,
this is a book,

471
00:21:53,450 --> 00:21:55,980
but nobody really believes this.
Yeah.

472
00:21:55,981 --> 00:21:58,200
So last week my guest is Peter 
Boghossian,

473
00:21:58,201 --> 00:21:59,034
who you're probably familiar with and he
wrote a book called a manual for 

474
00:22:02,761 --> 00:22:03,594
creating atheists and one of the things 
that I thought was most interesting 

475
00:22:05,551 --> 00:22:07,840
about it was that he basically said,
you know,

476
00:22:07,860 --> 00:22:08,693
because these beliefs are not based in 
critical thinking or rationality and 

477
00:22:12,451 --> 00:22:13,284
that people have to take this leap of 
faith that actually if you can really 

478
00:22:16,561 --> 00:22:19,910
sit someone down and you do it sort of 
with the right intent and,

479
00:22:19,911 --> 00:22:23,200
and a clear mind,
you can start pulling the,

480
00:22:23,220 --> 00:22:24,053
the underpinnings away in an effective 
way and you can actually convert people 

481
00:22:28,950 --> 00:22:30,640
into free thinkers.
Uh,

482
00:22:30,641 --> 00:22:33,000
I'm gonna Guess that you've done quite a
bit of that yourself.

483
00:22:33,810 --> 00:22:36,540
The only reason I do what I do,
Dave,

484
00:22:36,610 --> 00:22:40,380
is because of that.
Anytime somebody tells me,

485
00:22:40,381 --> 00:22:42,090
it's like another way that you talk to 
people.

486
00:22:42,091 --> 00:22:42,924
It's not going to work,
people aren't going to change their 

487
00:22:43,981 --> 00:22:47,400
mind.
That is absolutely not true.

488
00:22:47,490 --> 00:22:49,070
And I've got,
um,

489
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:49,600
you know,
if,

490
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:52,740
if you look at my inbox,
my email inbox,

491
00:22:52,741 --> 00:22:55,110
like almost on a daily basis,
you know,

492
00:22:55,111 --> 00:22:57,700
I get messages.
I mean the most recent one was not,

493
00:22:57,810 --> 00:22:58,643
I don't know if you read that post at 
one fire arrows by a friend of mine see 

494
00:23:00,301 --> 00:23:01,134
me Ramond and she wrote about the dead 
telling the difference between a 

495
00:23:03,541 --> 00:23:05,430
moderate and radical.
She lives in California.

496
00:23:05,431 --> 00:23:07,140
She's a pediatrician.
Um,

497
00:23:07,220 --> 00:23:07,771
I'll,
I'll,

498
00:23:07,771 --> 00:23:08,680
I'll send it to you.
Yeah,

499
00:23:08,890 --> 00:23:10,110
please do.
Yeah.

500
00:23:10,111 --> 00:23:11,160
And she,
um,

501
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:12,473
so it went viral,
got thousands and thousands of shares 

502
00:23:14,341 --> 00:23:15,174
and so on.
And she got a message just a few days 

503
00:23:18,930 --> 00:23:21,630
ago and there was this a woman who 
actually wore than the cop.

504
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:24,690
It was a very conservative family and 
she'd read it.

505
00:23:25,260 --> 00:23:26,093
And um,
she has now she's seriously thinking 

506
00:23:29,641 --> 00:23:30,474
about taking it off.
Like he was completely shaken the way 

507
00:23:32,371 --> 00:23:34,860
that she's thinking about things,
the way that she grew up.

508
00:23:34,861 --> 00:23:35,694
And these are stories that I hear 
everyday and I hear them more than ever 

509
00:23:40,290 --> 00:23:43,180
in Muslim majority countries.
And,

510
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:44,473
and this is what's so interesting is 
that in North America generally lead to 

511
00:23:48,050 --> 00:23:50,030
the Muslims because they're,
they're used to,

512
00:23:50,250 --> 00:23:51,083
uh,
the free speech and the open discourse 

513
00:23:52,401 --> 00:23:53,520
and everything.
Uh,

514
00:23:53,570 --> 00:23:56,390
they are,
they like to have a respectful approach.

515
00:23:56,391 --> 00:23:56,841
So like,
okay,

516
00:23:56,841 --> 00:23:59,390
criticize religion to be respectful of 
us.

517
00:23:59,391 --> 00:24:01,910
They don't like the tone that somebody 
like,

518
00:24:01,940 --> 00:24:02,773
for example,
like Richard Dawkins or Bill Maher 

519
00:24:04,120 --> 00:24:06,050
takes.
However,

520
00:24:06,051 --> 00:24:09,110
in the Muslim,
in these Muslim majority countries where

521
00:24:09,111 --> 00:24:12,320
they're living under these sorts of a 
theocratic dictatorships,

522
00:24:12,321 --> 00:24:14,480
even though they're not officially a 
theocratic dictatorships,

523
00:24:14,481 --> 00:24:16,030
almost all of them are,
um,

524
00:24:16,670 --> 00:24:17,630
for them,
they,

525
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:18,673
that really resonates for them with them
to eat with a more aggressive tone 

526
00:24:21,381 --> 00:24:23,930
because they're oppressed by it.
They can't speak.

527
00:24:23,990 --> 00:24:25,910
So they're angry.
They're frustrated.

528
00:24:26,510 --> 00:24:27,343
The last person that they heard who 
spoke went out and he got hacked to 

529
00:24:29,601 --> 00:24:32,500
death and in Daca.
And um,

530
00:24:32,660 --> 00:24:34,140
so you know,
they,

531
00:24:34,141 --> 00:24:36,650
they are,
they're angry and they're frustrated and

532
00:24:36,770 --> 00:24:38,240
they,
they want that kind of talent.

533
00:24:38,250 --> 00:24:39,083
They,
they feel like the respectful discourse 

534
00:24:40,910 --> 00:24:45,910
is the luxury of the privileged people 
who are able to have values like freedom

535
00:24:46,071 --> 00:24:46,904
of speech,
and then we can take that who take that 

536
00:24:47,811 --> 00:24:48,644
for granted.

537
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:51,880
That's really fascinating because,
you know,

538
00:24:51,950 --> 00:24:53,840
I've talked a lot about how people,
you know,

539
00:24:53,841 --> 00:24:57,380
especially it's Dawkins and Mara are the
two that have sort of become,

540
00:24:57,650 --> 00:25:00,950
you know,
the most outspoken on atheism really.

541
00:25:00,951 --> 00:25:03,650
And,
and talking about the doctrine of Islam,

542
00:25:03,651 --> 00:25:05,930
I think they're pretty both pretty clear

543
00:25:06,010 --> 00:25:07,830
that's out there in the Muslim majority 
countries.

544
00:25:07,831 --> 00:25:08,230
So.

545
00:25:08,230 --> 00:25:09,610
Yeah.
But what I think,

546
00:25:09,611 --> 00:25:13,450
what I think is interesting here is that
I hear from atheists will say,

547
00:25:13,451 --> 00:25:14,200
well,
Dawkins,

548
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:16,600
Mr they're there to offense,
you know,

549
00:25:16,620 --> 00:25:18,310
it's too offensive there'd be,
you know,

550
00:25:18,430 --> 00:25:21,970
they're putting out too much and they're
not speaking in a friendly way.

551
00:25:22,030 --> 00:25:25,510
So atheist or angry at them for being 
atheist.

552
00:25:25,990 --> 00:25:30,100
But interestingly you're saying that in 
foreign places in foreign countries,

553
00:25:30,280 --> 00:25:33,670
they need to hear it in that light.
And that's incredible.

554
00:25:34,340 --> 00:25:35,173
Yeah.
Because they actually want to say it 

555
00:25:35,971 --> 00:25:36,541
that way.
I mean,

556
00:25:36,541 --> 00:25:37,740
if you,
the most,

557
00:25:37,741 --> 00:25:38,574
um,
sort of aggressive sounding atheists 

558
00:25:41,560 --> 00:25:45,570
that you'll meet from the Muslim world 
are the ones who actually grew up.

559
00:25:45,590 --> 00:25:46,423
They're the ones with the accents are 
the ones who made it here after living 

560
00:25:49,351 --> 00:25:50,184
there who think that all Americans kind 
of take freedom of speech and polite 

561
00:25:52,771 --> 00:25:55,250
discourse and so on for granted.
So they,

562
00:25:55,251 --> 00:25:57,450
they are angry.
They want a more angry sort of,

563
00:25:57,480 --> 00:25:58,360
uh,
um,

564
00:25:58,650 --> 00:26:00,840
expression of it.
But there,

565
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:01,950
I mean,
there is a point,

566
00:26:01,951 --> 00:26:02,784
I do understand why people,
different things work on different 

567
00:26:05,761 --> 00:26:06,594
people.
I always give the example of the civil 

568
00:26:07,321 --> 00:26:08,131
rights movement,
how,

569
00:26:08,131 --> 00:26:10,530
you know,
Rosa parks acted in silence,

570
00:26:10,570 --> 00:26:12,350
you know,
she was sitting on the,

571
00:26:12,510 --> 00:26:14,220
on the bus and she said,
I'm not going to move back.

572
00:26:14,700 --> 00:26:15,533
On the other hand,
Martin Luther King was the diplomat 

573
00:26:17,870 --> 00:26:18,750
know,
so he was,

574
00:26:18,751 --> 00:26:21,030
um,
he was sort of more political.

575
00:26:21,030 --> 00:26:24,300
He was conciliatory,
used to try to make a reasoned arguments

576
00:26:24,301 --> 00:26:26,160
and talk to the other side.
On the other hand,

577
00:26:26,161 --> 00:26:31,161
you had malcolm x who was a more 
militant and all of those approaches had

578
00:26:32,460 --> 00:26:35,520
had a role that a very key role in and 
they work on different people.

579
00:26:35,820 --> 00:26:39,330
Um,
my approach is probably more sort of,

580
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:40,740
uh,
I,

581
00:26:40,741 --> 00:26:44,250
I tried to be reasonable.
I reasonable arguments.

582
00:26:44,251 --> 00:26:46,240
I try to do that at least.
Um,

583
00:26:46,290 --> 00:26:47,123
but um,
I do appreciate people who do the kind 

584
00:26:50,281 --> 00:26:51,114
of thing that Bill Maher and Richard 
Dawkins soon because I know that it 

585
00:26:54,180 --> 00:26:55,910
resonates.
I know that it's a,

586
00:26:56,450 --> 00:26:57,283
um,
it's a very satisfying to a lot of 

587
00:26:58,681 --> 00:26:59,514
people growing up there.
And I remember when I was growing up 

588
00:27:01,111 --> 00:27:01,944
there,
whenever I would hear people say things 

589
00:27:04,291 --> 00:27:06,090
like that.
And it was George Carlin at the time,

590
00:27:06,650 --> 00:27:07,420
you know,
I,

591
00:27:07,420 --> 00:27:08,253
um,
I remember seeing little things that 

592
00:27:09,751 --> 00:27:13,680
George Carlin had done and the way that 
he talked about religion,

593
00:27:13,681 --> 00:27:18,681
it was just so in your face.
And so like nakedly open some of it that

594
00:27:20,160 --> 00:27:20,993
it was extremely satisfying to watch.
But that's something that you could not 

595
00:27:23,820 --> 00:27:24,590
see and,
and you'd,

596
00:27:24,590 --> 00:27:25,423
you'd show it to your friends is on a 
vhs tape and show to your friends and 

597
00:27:27,721 --> 00:27:28,554
then you know,
little clip where you said it and you 

598
00:27:31,050 --> 00:27:35,250
see the shock on their faces and it was,
it was something really satisfying about

599
00:27:35,251 --> 00:27:35,480
it.

600
00:27:35,480 --> 00:27:36,051
Yeah.
Well,

601
00:27:36,051 --> 00:27:37,010
I,
I tell my friend,

602
00:27:37,011 --> 00:27:38,330
Kelly Carlin,
who has been on the show,

603
00:27:38,331 --> 00:27:39,164
who is George's daughter.
I tell Kelly literally once a week I'll 

604
00:27:42,741 --> 00:27:44,810
call her or text her and say,
God,

605
00:27:45,350 --> 00:27:46,071
God,
ironically,

606
00:27:46,071 --> 00:27:46,671
I'll say,
gosh,

607
00:27:46,671 --> 00:27:47,504
you know,
I really wish that your dad was around 

608
00:27:49,251 --> 00:27:50,084
now because we're so trapped and I think
this will get us to the next portion of 

609
00:27:53,601 --> 00:27:54,434
this conversation,
but we're so trapped in this pc world 

610
00:27:56,541 --> 00:27:57,374
right now and we're so afraid of 
language and we're so afraid of 

611
00:27:59,571 --> 00:28:02,000
offending everybody.
And already,

612
00:28:02,001 --> 00:28:02,834
as you've said,
sometimes you have to offend people to 

613
00:28:05,541 --> 00:28:08,240
actually break through.
It's not your style clearly.

614
00:28:08,270 --> 00:28:09,103
Right?
Like you're not looking to offend 

615
00:28:10,311 --> 00:28:11,144
everybody,

616
00:28:11,180 --> 00:28:14,070
but ended up doing it anyway.
I think that the nature of the.

617
00:28:14,970 --> 00:28:17,090
But you know,
the thing is,

618
00:28:17,091 --> 00:28:19,760
I'm like,
I hear this a lot,

619
00:28:19,761 --> 00:28:24,761
I hear a lot of people say that,
especially a lot of my Muslim friends in

620
00:28:25,010 --> 00:28:25,843
here living in the US and in Canada,
is that the free freedom of speech does 

621
00:28:30,351 --> 00:28:33,500
not mean the freedom of to offend.
And I always say to them,

622
00:28:33,501 --> 00:28:34,334
I'm like,
there's no such thing as freedom of 

623
00:28:35,691 --> 00:28:38,050
speech without the freedom and offend 
every.

624
00:28:38,150 --> 00:28:38,983
There is absolutely no major 
revolutionary change that has ever 

625
00:28:41,661 --> 00:28:44,240
happened in history that did not piss 
off a lot of people.

626
00:28:44,450 --> 00:28:48,800
So let's talk a little bit about our 
friends on the left because,

627
00:28:48,830 --> 00:28:49,910
uh,
I think they've,

628
00:28:49,930 --> 00:28:50,763
they failed us,
but particularly you and your friends 

629
00:28:54,861 --> 00:28:57,020
and family probably in,
in this regard,

630
00:28:57,050 --> 00:28:57,883
they have somehow align themselves with 
forces that don't want you to speak up 

631
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:04,370
against doctrine.
And I,

632
00:29:04,371 --> 00:29:05,204
and that's really incredible.
It's the reverse of liberalism and I'll 

633
00:29:07,701 --> 00:29:08,534
let you take it from there.

634
00:29:09,190 --> 00:29:09,490
Well,
I mean,

635
00:29:09,490 --> 00:29:11,740
that's what I think.
I think if you're against bad ideas,

636
00:29:12,420 --> 00:29:15,460
bad ideas anywhere,
if you oppose homophobia,

637
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:18,700
homophobia is a terrible thing.
It should be a bad thing.

638
00:29:19,250 --> 00:29:19,750
And,
you know,

639
00:29:19,750 --> 00:29:24,070
you pointed out every time it's someone 
caused the Bible or every time it's in a

640
00:29:24,071 --> 00:29:25,820
donald trump's speech,
um,

641
00:29:26,190 --> 00:29:28,150
you know,
or to Ted Cruz speech or whatever it is,

642
00:29:28,151 --> 00:29:33,151
then that's team idea is also a bad idea
when it's in the Koran and if it's being

643
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:36,880
said by Muslims,
including a lot of liberal Muslims,

644
00:29:37,130 --> 00:29:37,963
I mean,
that is something that even a lot of 

645
00:29:39,460 --> 00:29:42,010
liberal Muslims in North America haven't
warmed up to yet.

646
00:29:42,340 --> 00:29:44,210
So these,
um,

647
00:29:44,920 --> 00:29:45,753
I understand like there's the,
I think there's a certain instinct to 

648
00:29:48,550 --> 00:29:50,270
try and protect the minority,
uh,

649
00:29:50,570 --> 00:29:54,550
but the ideology that the minority here 
subscribes to just coincidentally,

650
00:29:54,551 --> 00:29:55,384
and I'm not saying that they follow it 
the same way that they do in other more 

651
00:29:58,631 --> 00:30:01,060
violent parts of the world,
but that same ideology,

652
00:30:01,061 --> 00:30:05,500
the same book is being used to kill 
people,

653
00:30:05,940 --> 00:30:06,190
right?

654
00:30:06,190 --> 00:30:10,570
And to throw gay people off rooftops in 
other parts of the world.

655
00:30:10,571 --> 00:30:11,404
So I think it's,
it is very confusing for everybody 

656
00:30:14,261 --> 00:30:15,094
because you know,
the way that it happens is people see 

657
00:30:19,001 --> 00:30:20,230
here,
especially non Muslims,

658
00:30:20,231 --> 00:30:21,064
they see on tv,
they see a group called the Islamic 

659
00:30:23,471 --> 00:30:24,304
state quoting the Koran accurately and 
actually seeing quoting verses that say 

660
00:30:28,961 --> 00:30:31,540
fight the disbelievers and charge them,
you know,

661
00:30:31,570 --> 00:30:34,750
at the Non Muslim tax and you know,
God will destroy them and so on.

662
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:38,400
So they're quoting these verses,
they're saying a lot whopper,

663
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:39,753
right?
So they're,

664
00:30:40,300 --> 00:30:41,133
they're obviously professing their faith
and then they're chopping someone's 

665
00:30:43,931 --> 00:30:46,030
heads off or throwing somebody off a 
rooftop.

666
00:30:46,900 --> 00:30:47,733
And the reaction over here often when 
they see that is that they immediately 

667
00:30:51,881 --> 00:30:54,710
jumped in defending the faith that this 
is the real faith.

668
00:30:55,270 --> 00:30:57,210
And the moment they say that,
you know,

669
00:30:57,220 --> 00:30:59,200
do bring the scripture to them.

670
00:30:59,290 --> 00:31:00,430
You're like,
well what about this verse?

671
00:31:00,431 --> 00:31:01,930
They quote just like you did with your 
friend,

672
00:31:02,500 --> 00:31:03,400
you know,
what about this versus that?

673
00:31:03,401 --> 00:31:06,490
They quoted this to says exactly the 
words that they said here,

674
00:31:06,820 --> 00:31:10,810
match the action,
and then they start defending the verses

675
00:31:10,870 --> 00:31:14,890
and the book a misinterpretation out of 
context.

676
00:31:14,891 --> 00:31:16,140
And so on.
All the,

677
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:17,033
you know that sort of the excuses that 
you're here and so now what you have is 

678
00:31:21,461 --> 00:31:22,294
you have moderate Muslims here.
I'm defending the same book that the 

679
00:31:27,611 --> 00:31:28,444
fundamentalists over there are quoting 
and citing to kill non Muslims over 

680
00:31:33,041 --> 00:31:33,874
there that the non Muslims are looking 
at this side of the world and that is 

681
00:31:39,310 --> 00:31:40,143
toxic because it actually makes.
That gives the impression the moderate 

682
00:31:44,471 --> 00:31:47,650
Muslims over here are pretty much that 
they subscribed to the same ideology.

683
00:31:47,680 --> 00:31:49,960
They're just not acting on it,
which is not true,

684
00:31:50,180 --> 00:31:51,850
but that's impression of gifts.

685
00:31:51,970 --> 00:31:55,690
Not only is it not true,
but it seems to me that people like you,

686
00:31:55,691 --> 00:31:58,150
people like my new eyes,
Sarah Haider,

687
00:31:58,570 --> 00:31:59,403
great people in my estimation,
who I think are fighting for the right 

688
00:32:02,051 --> 00:32:02,884
things,
who are applying the same principles 

689
00:32:04,571 --> 00:32:05,404
across the board.
They're not looking at your faith or 

690
00:32:08,231 --> 00:32:10,660
your race or your nationality.
They're saying,

691
00:32:10,661 --> 00:32:12,610
here are humanistic principles,
right?

692
00:32:12,611 --> 00:32:17,611
That I want to apply to everyone.
The left is the one attacking them.

693
00:32:18,101 --> 00:32:21,670
Did you ever expect that that was going 
to be the push back for you?

694
00:32:23,300 --> 00:32:27,530
For me,
I know I didn't honestly.

695
00:32:27,660 --> 00:32:28,071
Well,
I mean,

696
00:32:28,071 --> 00:32:28,904
I knew that there were a lot of sort of 
moderate Muslims that wouldn't have 

697
00:32:31,881 --> 00:32:33,770
problems with it.
I just didn't think that,

698
00:32:33,771 --> 00:32:34,960
uh,
uh,

699
00:32:34,970 --> 00:32:35,491
the,
uh,

700
00:32:35,491 --> 00:32:38,460
the sort of these cj wellman's and the,
you know,

701
00:32:39,380 --> 00:32:41,720
I guess whatever we call the regressive 
left.

702
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:43,440
Um,
Dave,

703
00:32:44,090 --> 00:32:44,923
I can't keep track of all of them.
So this is just the one for most recent 

704
00:32:49,431 --> 00:32:50,080
memory,

705
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:53,200
but the list on the side of your bed,
I have a chalkboard and I've just always

706
00:32:53,201 --> 00:32:54,550
adding to the list.
You don't have that.

707
00:32:54,820 --> 00:32:55,960
I can't,
I have,

708
00:32:56,020 --> 00:33:00,050
I have better things to do.
I don't have enough time or crayons,

709
00:33:00,070 --> 00:33:01,450
students,
lots of bumps.

710
00:33:01,870 --> 00:33:03,970
I am spending a fortune in shock.
It's ridiculous.

711
00:33:05,170 --> 00:33:06,003
No,
but the thing with the regressive left 

712
00:33:07,350 --> 00:33:09,660
on a serious note is there they're 
reacting to,

713
00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:10,593
you know,
the pushback that we're getting is a 

714
00:33:11,771 --> 00:33:14,280
reaction.
And for them I,

715
00:33:14,290 --> 00:33:16,500
I just look at that entire thing is a 
very,

716
00:33:16,501 --> 00:33:18,990
very reactionary thing.
Their only argument,

717
00:33:19,070 --> 00:33:23,880
the only argument they have to anything 
as big an Islamophobe House,

718
00:33:23,881 --> 00:33:26,130
Muslim or uh,
you know,

719
00:33:26,131 --> 00:33:29,280
the Brown skinned white,
I don't know what it was.

720
00:33:29,281 --> 00:33:30,114
Yeah.

721
00:33:30,610 --> 00:33:34,480
So there's that,
that's the only argument that they have.

722
00:33:34,481 --> 00:33:35,171
And I,
I,

723
00:33:35,171 --> 00:33:37,420
I'm actually encouraged,
I'm optimistic about it.

724
00:33:37,421 --> 00:33:39,580
I mean,
if you looked at in the past,

725
00:33:39,581 --> 00:33:40,414
every time one of these attacks happened
and there was some conversation to be 

726
00:33:44,470 --> 00:33:49,470
taking place on tv about it on CNN or 
msnbc or Fox or anything,

727
00:33:50,380 --> 00:33:54,460
it would always be Reza Aslan who would 
come on or they'd call,

728
00:33:54,560 --> 00:33:56,920
you know,
the comedian guy,

729
00:33:57,320 --> 00:34:02,290
uh,
on CNN deemed so him.

730
00:34:02,350 --> 00:34:03,940
And so they would,
you know,

731
00:34:03,970 --> 00:34:06,040
they'd,
that that's what they would do.

732
00:34:06,041 --> 00:34:07,840
But now I'm not seeing that.
So,

733
00:34:07,860 --> 00:34:08,471
you know,
since,

734
00:34:08,471 --> 00:34:09,304
um,
these new attacks and now that 

735
00:34:11,860 --> 00:34:14,010
everything is getting even more serious,
you know,

736
00:34:14,050 --> 00:34:18,730
I'm seeing more of Majid on TV.
I'm seeing more of US trying to Monte on

737
00:34:18,731 --> 00:34:20,080
TV.
Um,

738
00:34:20,200 --> 00:34:21,640
you know,
I'm seeing voices like this.

739
00:34:21,641 --> 00:34:24,520
I'm seeing Ayaan Hirsi Ali being called 
on to talk about things.

740
00:34:24,700 --> 00:34:28,130
So I,
I think that most of the,

741
00:34:29,120 --> 00:34:32,110
even the so called mainstream media is 
seeing through it.

742
00:34:32,420 --> 00:34:33,253
A Bill Maher actually said on the last 
show that he was on or the one with us 

743
00:34:36,850 --> 00:34:40,720
when he interviewed her.
He actually said that he's more and more

744
00:34:40,721 --> 00:34:42,460
liberals are coming up to an agreement 
with them.

745
00:34:42,670 --> 00:34:44,470
They used to get a lot of crap from him 
before,

746
00:34:45,010 --> 00:34:45,843
but he doesn't anymore.
And I think that that's changing and I 

747
00:34:49,541 --> 00:34:50,374
think that this whole,
what we call the regressive left is 

748
00:34:52,990 --> 00:34:54,250
simply responding to them.

749
00:34:54,300 --> 00:34:54,991
Well,
I got to tell you,

750
00:34:54,991 --> 00:34:57,840
I mean that sounds incredibly uplifting 
because,

751
00:34:57,841 --> 00:34:58,311
you know,
I'm,

752
00:34:58,311 --> 00:34:59,144
I'm so in this and having these 
conversations and as I said at the top 

753
00:35:02,131 --> 00:35:02,964
of the show,
I find a lot of it exhausting and I 

754
00:35:05,130 --> 00:35:07,440
battled sort of between back and forth 
of like,

755
00:35:07,441 --> 00:35:08,274
can I move on from this topic?
And every time I move on I feel like I 

756
00:35:10,861 --> 00:35:13,220
get sucked back in and you know,
I'll,

757
00:35:13,300 --> 00:35:16,050
I'll put it away and then I'll suddenly 
see your,

758
00:35:16,051 --> 00:35:18,030
your twitter fight with someone or I'll 
see,

759
00:35:18,470 --> 00:35:19,303
you know,
Greenwald attacking Sam or whatever it 

760
00:35:20,731 --> 00:35:21,564
is.
But I think you gave me a little 

761
00:35:22,741 --> 00:35:27,690
something to go with there because the 
idea that they are acting out more.

762
00:35:27,691 --> 00:35:30,840
It's getting more like a,
a child having a tantrum.

763
00:35:30,990 --> 00:35:31,823
And maybe it's just because they realize
this is the last vestige of an ideology 

764
00:35:36,061 --> 00:35:38,190
that's just not gonna work because

765
00:35:38,190 --> 00:35:39,210
we've woke up,
right?

766
00:35:39,860 --> 00:35:40,693
Yeah.
I think that there are there prodding 

767
00:35:42,271 --> 00:35:46,230
basically for a response and we give it 
to them,

768
00:35:46,340 --> 00:35:47,430
you know,
in all honesty.

769
00:35:47,431 --> 00:35:49,410
A lot of times I'll ignore it for 
awhile.

770
00:35:49,530 --> 00:35:50,730
And I,
and I,

771
00:35:50,740 --> 00:35:51,670
I,
uh,

772
00:35:51,900 --> 00:35:52,733
you know,
like with,

773
00:35:52,760 --> 00:35:55,170
um,
I'll ignore it for very long time,

774
00:35:55,320 --> 00:35:56,153
but if I do decide to respond to decide 
response strong and it usually the 

775
00:35:58,981 --> 00:36:00,770
response is not for the person making 
it.

776
00:36:00,771 --> 00:36:01,604
It's for the rest of the audience,
for everybody else who's watching the 

777
00:36:03,691 --> 00:36:04,480
conversation.
I mean,

778
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:07,080
I,
I'm under no illusions that I can,

779
00:36:07,140 --> 00:36:11,010
I can change the minds of a lot of these
sort of hacks on,

780
00:36:11,360 --> 00:36:11,840
uh,
that,

781
00:36:11,840 --> 00:36:12,673
that a lot of the trolls that actually 
tried to dissuade us and trying to 

782
00:36:15,810 --> 00:36:17,490
deflect everything.
But,

783
00:36:17,491 --> 00:36:18,324
um,
I think that for the wider audience who 

784
00:36:20,701 --> 00:36:24,570
seen the conversations,
it's good for them to see what they're,

785
00:36:24,690 --> 00:36:26,700
what they're dealing with,
to see both sides of it.

786
00:36:26,700 --> 00:36:28,450
And to see that play out,
you know,

787
00:36:28,451 --> 00:36:32,880
on whether on social media or in books 
or in articles and so on.

788
00:36:32,881 --> 00:36:33,870
So I,
I think that,

789
00:36:34,340 --> 00:36:34,860
you know,
the,

790
00:36:34,860 --> 00:36:35,700
you know,
I'll give you,

791
00:36:36,630 --> 00:36:38,640
I think that they're reacting to,
for instance,

792
00:36:38,641 --> 00:36:42,150
with Sam Harris.
Sam Harris has a lot of great ideas.

793
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:44,370
He started a lot of really good 
conversations,

794
00:36:44,371 --> 00:36:45,204
in fact,
everything that we're seeing right now 

795
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:47,633
with the rise of Donald Trump.
And so the hijacking of this 

796
00:36:50,251 --> 00:36:51,084
conversation by the sort of Xeno phobic 
paranoid side and now them gaining 

797
00:36:57,571 --> 00:36:58,404
ground and capitalizing on the,
on the fear and the concern and the 

798
00:37:01,471 --> 00:37:03,550
confusion that everybody's feeling,
um,

799
00:37:03,630 --> 00:37:05,190
something that the left should have 
done,

800
00:37:05,990 --> 00:37:08,880
but they didn't do right.
And they should have done it from a sort

801
00:37:08,881 --> 00:37:10,890
of a moral,
a honest,

802
00:37:11,330 --> 00:37:12,710
a position.
And,

803
00:37:12,711 --> 00:37:16,290
and now it's being done by the right 
from a Suunto phobic bigoted position.

804
00:37:16,610 --> 00:37:17,443
I'm at.
This is something that Sam predicted a 

805
00:37:21,061 --> 00:37:23,760
long time ago that he wrote about it.
Um,

806
00:37:23,790 --> 00:37:26,010
and now,
uh,

807
00:37:26,060 --> 00:37:27,120
I,
I think,

808
00:37:27,121 --> 00:37:28,170
you know,
what's happening is that,

809
00:37:28,190 --> 00:37:28,561
you know,
this,

810
00:37:28,561 --> 00:37:29,394
all of these spots back and forth with 
the green walls and the world and you 

811
00:37:33,721 --> 00:37:34,554
know,
all of these other sort of characters 

812
00:37:36,360 --> 00:37:41,360
and they're deflecting from what was 
initially that the actual thing that was

813
00:37:43,411 --> 00:37:45,000
causing this response in the first 
place.

814
00:37:45,900 --> 00:37:47,880
Can you go ahead,
sorry.

815
00:37:48,620 --> 00:37:49,453
Oh No,
I was just saying we should continue 

816
00:37:50,250 --> 00:37:53,190
what exactly what we were doing before 
is what we should be doing.

817
00:37:53,580 --> 00:37:55,410
We should just be talking about the 
ideas.

818
00:37:55,830 --> 00:37:58,410
I'm sticking to the big picture.
I mean,

819
00:37:58,411 --> 00:38:03,411
I came from when I,
when I came here to Canada and to the US

820
00:38:03,810 --> 00:38:08,810
after living for 24 years and enlisted 
majority countries.

821
00:38:09,630 --> 00:38:12,330
I wanted to bring,
I want to talk about big ideas,

822
00:38:12,360 --> 00:38:13,193
you know,
I wasn't really concerned about 

823
00:38:15,300 --> 00:38:18,360
microaggressions or progressive left or 
you know,

824
00:38:18,361 --> 00:38:19,194
all of these other issues.
I actually wanted to talk about the big 

825
00:38:20,941 --> 00:38:22,530
ideas and,
and uh,

826
00:38:22,680 --> 00:38:25,910
I've noticed that the more,
a lot of us over here are,

827
00:38:25,980 --> 00:38:28,170
you know,
there are people who try to pull us into

828
00:38:28,171 --> 00:38:29,004
these more sort of petty Jerry Springer 
like conversations and I think it would 

829
00:38:34,081 --> 00:38:36,790
serve us best.
Just ignore it.

830
00:38:37,050 --> 00:38:38,100
Yeah.
Well listen,

831
00:38:38,101 --> 00:38:39,340
I'm doing my best to

832
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:40,273
do that and I know I'm saying that it's 
especially after what happened last 

833
00:38:43,670 --> 00:38:44,503
week,
so I'm with me as well once in a while 

834
00:38:48,290 --> 00:38:49,123
or what,

835
00:38:49,400 --> 00:38:50,233
once in a while I think you have to do 
it and you have to look had all this 

836
00:38:53,720 --> 00:38:57,410
terrible stuff and all of the slandering
and all this stuff not happened.

837
00:38:57,710 --> 00:38:59,910
Then I think the awakening,
it'll,

838
00:38:59,930 --> 00:39:02,480
let's say you were awake probably before
I was.

839
00:39:02,481 --> 00:39:03,314
I mean my real awakening to this 
literally was that that night watching 

840
00:39:06,891 --> 00:39:10,190
real time with that athletic thing.
So had it not happened,

841
00:39:10,191 --> 00:39:12,730
I may have been slumbering through,
you know,

842
00:39:12,731 --> 00:39:14,690
the left going further and further to 
the left.

843
00:39:14,691 --> 00:39:18,200
So in a weird way,
it is actually very empowering,

844
00:39:18,460 --> 00:39:19,293
but I,
that's actually a perfect segue to talk 

845
00:39:21,081 --> 00:39:22,400
about next,
which you're touching upon,

846
00:39:22,401 --> 00:39:26,240
which is that by not dealing with this 
in an honest fashion,

847
00:39:26,840 --> 00:39:30,560
by not really allowing the people to 
speak about it,

848
00:39:30,561 --> 00:39:33,170
the liberals,
to speak about it in a fair way.

849
00:39:33,470 --> 00:39:36,230
You're handing this to trump and we're 
seeing this,

850
00:39:36,440 --> 00:39:37,273
we're seeing this right now in America.
We're seeing this in Europe where for 

851
00:39:41,361 --> 00:39:46,070
the first time ever in places like 
Sweden and Denmark far right parties are

852
00:39:46,130 --> 00:39:49,820
running on anti immigration because it's
all wrapped up in.

853
00:39:49,821 --> 00:39:52,100
Well,
we're afraid to be called racist.

854
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:53,120
So it's crazy,
right?

855
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:54,380
Yeah.
They're,

856
00:39:54,380 --> 00:39:56,190
they're all,
everybody's Islamophobia,

857
00:39:56,191 --> 00:40:00,990
phobic fear of being called a song 
phobic.

858
00:40:01,350 --> 00:40:03,510
And um,
yeah,

859
00:40:03,511 --> 00:40:05,490
I think,
I think you're absolutely right.

860
00:40:05,491 --> 00:40:08,100
I did.
We did in a way hand this to trump.

861
00:40:09,360 --> 00:40:10,193
The problem over here is that there's.
Trump is not actually responsible for 

862
00:40:15,150 --> 00:40:15,983
all of this anti Muslim hate and all 
this kind of time with some sentiment 

863
00:40:18,121 --> 00:40:20,380
that's happening.
So let's be clear on that,

864
00:40:20,381 --> 00:40:24,930
that the party that's responsible for 
that is the attackers,

865
00:40:25,090 --> 00:40:25,923
the isis,
that people who would talk to Paris of 

866
00:40:27,511 --> 00:40:30,290
people who are making all these videos 
of beheadings,

867
00:40:30,300 --> 00:40:33,390
of journalists and so on.
I mean these are the people,

868
00:40:33,480 --> 00:40:37,920
a debt the Americans and Westerners in 
general are reacting to.

869
00:40:38,070 --> 00:40:38,581
Right?
But wait,

870
00:40:38,581 --> 00:40:39,414
let me stop you there because what would
you say to my friends on the left who 

871
00:40:41,161 --> 00:40:41,641
would say,
well,

872
00:40:41,641 --> 00:40:43,530
it's America that created isis.

873
00:40:44,220 --> 00:40:45,590
Well,
America,

874
00:40:45,700 --> 00:40:47,970
there,
it's obviously a complicated thing,

875
00:40:48,090 --> 00:40:48,923
you know,
US foreign policy or there's US foreign 

876
00:40:50,881 --> 00:40:52,050
policy.
There's nationalism,

877
00:40:52,051 --> 00:40:53,310
there's greed,
there's power,

878
00:40:53,320 --> 00:40:54,153
there's corporate corporatocracy and all
these other characters that people talk 

879
00:40:56,401 --> 00:40:58,900
about racism and misogyny.
And you were telling me that like,

880
00:40:59,050 --> 00:41:01,680
why do you always pick on religion when 
you have all of these factors?

881
00:41:01,681 --> 00:41:03,360
And I,
I always turned around and I tell them,

882
00:41:03,361 --> 00:41:04,680
I'm like,
I agree with you.

883
00:41:05,250 --> 00:41:06,083
It didn't belong them right up there in 
the same category with racism and greed 

884
00:41:09,541 --> 00:41:11,660
and misogyny and uh,
you know,

885
00:41:11,730 --> 00:41:14,070
the terrible things that everybody else 
is doing.

886
00:41:14,071 --> 00:41:19,071
So I do think that US foreign policy is 
a factor and the argument has never been

887
00:41:20,280 --> 00:41:23,220
that a religion is the only caused a 
religious sentiments.

888
00:41:23,221 --> 00:41:24,054
He only caused the.
We're not asking people to recognize or 

889
00:41:27,301 --> 00:41:29,400
to think that it's not everything else 
that's religion.

890
00:41:29,730 --> 00:41:30,563
We're just saying that the only thing 
that we're going against the idea that 

891
00:41:34,431 --> 00:41:35,264
it's everything but religion to ignore 
the religious aspect of it or the fact 

892
00:41:40,521 --> 00:41:44,930
that beliefs actually have consequences 
because we want to respect it.

893
00:41:45,320 --> 00:41:46,730
So,
you know,

894
00:41:47,030 --> 00:41:50,150
what I was saying earlier is that what 
Donald trump is doing is that there is a

895
00:41:50,151 --> 00:41:50,984
lot of confusion.
There's a lot of fear that a lot of 

896
00:41:52,851 --> 00:41:53,684
people have right now,
legitimately the way that you channel 

897
00:41:58,411 --> 00:41:59,244
that,
the way that leaders channel that is 

898
00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:03,460
what makes all the difference.
You know.

899
00:42:03,470 --> 00:42:05,990
So Donald trump has basically fed off of
it.

900
00:42:06,440 --> 00:42:09,040
He's drummed it up more for his own 
opportunities,

901
00:42:09,050 --> 00:42:13,010
this opportunistic purposes and these 
turn into let's ban all Muslims.

902
00:42:13,540 --> 00:42:16,100
Um,
if there was another reasonable voice,

903
00:42:16,880 --> 00:42:17,521
you know,
on,

904
00:42:17,521 --> 00:42:19,730
on the left,
and they had channeled that and they had

905
00:42:19,731 --> 00:42:23,810
kind of responsibly dealt with it in an 
honest way,

906
00:42:24,620 --> 00:42:27,490
then we may see a different outcome 
when,

907
00:42:27,770 --> 00:42:30,110
when people are confused,
that's when leadership matters.

908
00:42:30,350 --> 00:42:33,500
And that's where the liberals I think 
failed.

909
00:42:33,720 --> 00:42:34,860
So that,
that's interesting.

910
00:42:34,861 --> 00:42:37,410
That naturally I,
I agree with that premise,

911
00:42:37,411 --> 00:42:40,890
but I think you could really take it to 
the candidates themselves.

912
00:42:40,891 --> 00:42:42,780
So for example,
Bernie Sanders,

913
00:42:42,781 --> 00:42:44,340
who I like a lot,
obviously,

914
00:42:44,730 --> 00:42:46,080
and Hillary,
uh,

915
00:42:46,230 --> 00:42:48,150
when you take the candidates that are on
the left,

916
00:42:48,151 --> 00:42:52,260
that are the Democrats,
when they won't say Islamic extremism or

917
00:42:52,261 --> 00:42:54,090
they won't say violent Jihad or 
whatever,

918
00:42:54,150 --> 00:42:55,730
whatever the term you want to,
you know,

919
00:42:55,740 --> 00:42:59,220
everyone gets so caught up in terms that
I hate even using words at this point,

920
00:42:59,400 --> 00:43:03,060
but when they won't even say the terms 
and they'll just say religious extremism

921
00:43:03,061 --> 00:43:04,470
or something,
I think that,

922
00:43:04,500 --> 00:43:08,600
that they also then hand it to trump 
because trump's just given you.

923
00:43:08,640 --> 00:43:10,630
He's just given you the,
the wide,

924
00:43:11,440 --> 00:43:12,273
wide net to go with and they're.
And they're still playing the games of 

925
00:43:15,121 --> 00:43:16,170
political correctness.

926
00:43:16,600 --> 00:43:18,350
That's exactly that.
I completely agree that,

927
00:43:18,351 --> 00:43:20,830
that is kind of what I was trying to say
is that they do it.

928
00:43:20,840 --> 00:43:21,673
So there,
there are two things that have to be 

929
00:43:22,701 --> 00:43:23,534
done right now.
One is that the rights of Muslims have 

930
00:43:25,581 --> 00:43:28,040
to be protected,
and number two,

931
00:43:28,700 --> 00:43:31,370
Islamic doctrine has to be challenged 
and criticized.

932
00:43:31,550 --> 00:43:34,070
Both of those things have to be done.
What the,

933
00:43:34,160 --> 00:43:36,470
what the Hillary Clinton or Bernie 
Sanders,

934
00:43:36,500 --> 00:43:37,333
uh,
a site is doing is they're trying to 

935
00:43:39,321 --> 00:43:40,154
protect all the rights of Muslims 
without actually challenging the 

936
00:43:42,381 --> 00:43:43,214
ideology.
And what the Donald Trump on the right 

937
00:43:45,290 --> 00:43:49,970
of these people are doing is that 
they're challenging the ideology without

938
00:43:49,971 --> 00:43:52,840
protecting the rights of the people.
And,

939
00:43:52,910 --> 00:43:56,450
and it's not an undead.
People think that that's contradictory.

940
00:43:56,451 --> 00:43:59,300
It's not contradictory at all.
This is what I think it was voltaire who

941
00:43:59,301 --> 00:43:59,721
said,
right?

942
00:43:59,721 --> 00:44:00,091
Like,
I,

943
00:44:00,091 --> 00:44:02,090
I will,
I may despise what you say,

944
00:44:02,091 --> 00:44:05,420
but I'll defend to the death your right 
to say it's the same principle.

945
00:44:05,730 --> 00:44:06,563
Um,
and it's not that difficult to do if we 

946
00:44:08,631 --> 00:44:10,970
have a responsible leader who actually 
does that.

947
00:44:11,300 --> 00:44:12,133
I think that that is something that a 
lot of people would relate to and they 

948
00:44:14,691 --> 00:44:16,400
would understand that,
okay,

949
00:44:16,490 --> 00:44:20,000
we will challenge doctrine and a lot of 
Muslims they'll get her like,

950
00:44:20,001 --> 00:44:20,834
you know,
you're challenging my religion and this 

951
00:44:21,621 --> 00:44:22,454
is my identity because people 
incorporate their beliefs into their 

952
00:44:25,521 --> 00:44:28,500
identity and the dialogue would be,
well,

953
00:44:28,550 --> 00:44:29,440
yes,
you're a person.

954
00:44:29,441 --> 00:44:30,830
We respect your right to believe what 
you.

955
00:44:31,350 --> 00:44:34,020
But you know,
these are ideas.

956
00:44:34,290 --> 00:44:36,510
Ideas are different.
We're talking about the ideas.

957
00:44:36,511 --> 00:44:37,950
We're not talking about you as a person.

958
00:44:38,280 --> 00:44:39,690
Right?
So that if the,

959
00:44:39,700 --> 00:44:43,340
if there was a political party that was 
running a,

960
00:44:43,420 --> 00:44:44,253
you know,
that said we're gonna throw gays off 

961
00:44:45,301 --> 00:44:48,150
roofs and we're going to stone women and
kill apostates,

962
00:44:48,151 --> 00:44:50,310
you'd probably be against that political
party.

963
00:44:50,311 --> 00:44:53,070
But as a religion,
as a religious doctrine,

964
00:44:53,280 --> 00:44:55,620
it gets a little extra credit or 
something.

965
00:44:55,980 --> 00:44:57,120
That's it.
That's the thing.

966
00:44:57,121 --> 00:44:57,954
Like there's a lot of it completely.
It would be completely strange things 

967
00:45:02,161 --> 00:45:03,580
that we do,
for example,

968
00:45:03,581 --> 00:45:06,930
of neonatal circumcision,
like infant circumcision is one of those

969
00:45:06,931 --> 00:45:08,350
things where,
you know,

970
00:45:08,460 --> 00:45:08,971
we,
I mean,

971
00:45:08,971 --> 00:45:10,310
my parents did it,
you know,

972
00:45:10,320 --> 00:45:12,540
my siblings have done it to their 
nephews and so on.

973
00:45:12,541 --> 00:45:13,740
It's a very dense,
illegal.

974
00:45:13,741 --> 00:45:16,560
You're not everybody does it,
but when you really think about it,

975
00:45:17,190 --> 00:45:20,970
if there was,
if there was no religion behind it or as

976
00:45:20,971 --> 00:45:25,790
I like to save Abraham didn't,
wasn't so fond of dickheads you would do

977
00:45:26,020 --> 00:45:26,853
this would be child abuse.
You'd have pediatricians getting sued 

978
00:45:29,161 --> 00:45:29,660
for this.

979
00:45:29,660 --> 00:45:30,121
All right,
so I,

980
00:45:30,121 --> 00:45:32,310
I,
so I want to circle back a little bit to

981
00:45:32,311 --> 00:45:36,000
the beginning of the conversation and 
your history and your story for a second

982
00:45:36,001 --> 00:45:38,280
because you identify as an atheist 
Muslim.

983
00:45:38,281 --> 00:45:39,150
Is that correct?

984
00:45:39,680 --> 00:45:40,880
Well,
if he is Muslim,

985
00:45:40,881 --> 00:45:44,930
was the title of my book doctrinally.
It can't be an atheist Muslim,

986
00:45:44,931 --> 00:45:49,370
but the whole point of the book is to 
talk about the incorporation of religion

987
00:45:49,371 --> 00:45:51,170
into identity.
Uh,

988
00:45:51,171 --> 00:45:54,120
so there are a lot of.
I mean what,

989
00:45:54,990 --> 00:45:57,140
so I'll explain it this way.
When I first came here,

990
00:45:58,340 --> 00:45:59,173
two years after I permanently moved to 
permanently move to Canada is when the 

991
00:46:04,520 --> 00:46:07,910
nine slash 11 attacks happened.
And when that happened,

992
00:46:07,911 --> 00:46:08,201
I,
you know,

993
00:46:08,201 --> 00:46:10,550
I had this whole conversation in my 
head,

994
00:46:10,551 --> 00:46:11,900
you know,
was part of a Muslim family.

995
00:46:11,960 --> 00:46:14,010
I grew up with Muslim people.
I,

996
00:46:14,270 --> 00:46:17,030
it,
I was in all the Muslim traditions.

997
00:46:17,150 --> 00:46:19,740
They at that Ramadan,
the,

998
00:46:19,800 --> 00:46:21,800
a lot of things are cultural.
They're reasonably cultural,

999
00:46:21,801 --> 00:46:25,460
but there's some sort of Muslim things 
like Ramadan.

1000
00:46:25,461 --> 00:46:28,100
So in doing so that was all a part of 
me,

1001
00:46:28,101 --> 00:46:31,310
but at the same time I wasn't a huge fan
of the ideology.

1002
00:46:31,690 --> 00:46:33,200
Um,
so when I,

1003
00:46:33,230 --> 00:46:34,550
when I came here,
the 9:11

1004
00:46:34,551 --> 00:46:35,384
attacks happened.
This whole conversation that had been 

1005
00:46:36,381 --> 00:46:37,214
going on in my head for a very long time
suddenly exploded and it was all going 

1006
00:46:40,580 --> 00:46:43,250
on on TV.
It was on the radio is everywhere.

1007
00:46:43,580 --> 00:46:46,730
And there were two sides to it.
There was sort of the,

1008
00:46:47,040 --> 00:46:48,350
the,
the liberal side.

1009
00:46:48,351 --> 00:46:49,460
And they said that,
you know,

1010
00:46:49,490 --> 00:46:54,490
Muslims must be protected as a minority.
So any criticism of Islam is bigotry.

1011
00:46:55,840 --> 00:46:56,673
And on the right it was that.
And this is the sort of the Fox News 

1012
00:47:00,261 --> 00:47:04,630
narrative was that Islam is a sort of 
an,

1013
00:47:04,700 --> 00:47:05,960
it's a,
it's a,

1014
00:47:06,050 --> 00:47:09,020
it's a violent religion,
so Muslims,

1015
00:47:09,021 --> 00:47:10,760
you know,
we need to profile everybody,

1016
00:47:10,761 --> 00:47:13,630
you know,
we need to clamp down on immigration,

1017
00:47:13,650 --> 00:47:14,600
you know,
all of those things.

1018
00:47:15,080 --> 00:47:15,913
And there was one mistake both of them 
were doing is they were conflating the 

1019
00:47:19,371 --> 00:47:20,204
ideology with the people putting the 
ideology with the identity and this and 

1020
00:47:27,950 --> 00:47:31,690
this is where I wish actually a middle 
ground and I think what we're seeing,

1021
00:47:31,691 --> 00:47:34,420
we're seeing the same thing with the 
regressive left on one side.

1022
00:47:34,421 --> 00:47:35,410
And you know,
the,

1023
00:47:35,411 --> 00:47:36,244
the Donald trump phenomenon on the other
is the same thing as the completion of 

1024
00:47:38,801 --> 00:47:39,370
this,
uh,

1025
00:47:39,370 --> 00:47:42,940
sort of ideology and people invite by 
people,

1026
00:47:42,941 --> 00:47:43,774
I mean people who are a Muslim Muslim 
just because it's as a birth identity 

1027
00:47:47,321 --> 00:47:49,110
because most people are Muslim because 
it's just a birth.

1028
00:47:49,120 --> 00:47:49,850
That identity.

1029
00:47:49,850 --> 00:47:51,950
Right.
So for you personally,

1030
00:47:51,951 --> 00:47:54,740
while you're obviously an atheist,
so you're a nonbeliever,

1031
00:47:55,450 --> 00:47:58,100
do you,
are you culturally Muslim?

1032
00:47:58,101 --> 00:48:00,110
Like what does that actually mean to you
at this point?

1033
00:48:00,111 --> 00:48:00,944
Like,
I assume your family probably does some 

1034
00:48:02,301 --> 00:48:03,950
holiday stuff,
maybe you don't believe in it,

1035
00:48:03,951 --> 00:48:06,380
but do you culturally identify the way 
for me,

1036
00:48:06,381 --> 00:48:08,240
for example,
I am an atheist,

1037
00:48:08,241 --> 00:48:09,074
I am not a believer,
but there are Jewish traditions that my 

1038
00:48:11,811 --> 00:48:14,420
family that my grandparents did that 
their grandparents did,

1039
00:48:14,450 --> 00:48:16,580
their grandparents did that my family 
does,

1040
00:48:16,581 --> 00:48:17,414
so I can do that and I,
and it doesn't have a religious 

1041
00:48:19,641 --> 00:48:21,980
connotation.
It has a cultural connotation to me.

1042
00:48:22,480 --> 00:48:23,970
That's it.
That's exactly what it is.

1043
00:48:23,971 --> 00:48:26,250
I mean,
I enjoy not enjoy the FISA.

1044
00:48:26,280 --> 00:48:29,730
Ramadan Ramadan's a great time.
You people fasting.

1045
00:48:29,731 --> 00:48:32,290
I don't necessarily fast but I'm there 
for them.

1046
00:48:32,480 --> 00:48:37,130
It's a bit much and I like to eat 
celebration so I like,

1047
00:48:37,140 --> 00:48:37,973
you know,
I have little nieces and nephews and 

1048
00:48:38,941 --> 00:48:39,774
they all dress up and you know,
I get them gifts and so I enjoy that as 

1049
00:48:43,890 --> 00:48:44,770
much as anybody I'm on,
I,

1050
00:48:45,170 --> 00:48:48,600
I'm very close to my family,
my nuclear family and my extended family

1051
00:48:49,020 --> 00:48:53,280
and a lot of them are believing Muslims 
so I do take part in that.

1052
00:48:53,630 --> 00:48:54,463
Um,
but there was also another place where 

1053
00:48:56,791 --> 00:48:57,960
it affects you.
For instance,

1054
00:48:58,350 --> 00:48:59,183
I read a story about this kid who was 
called was beat up at school and 

1055
00:49:04,500 --> 00:49:05,191
because,
uh,

1056
00:49:05,191 --> 00:49:06,024
and they said that she was an isis baby 
or nicest kid and neither one of my 

1057
00:49:09,990 --> 00:49:13,530
niece and um,
I don't want my niece to go through that

1058
00:49:13,531 --> 00:49:16,500
and I did like this whole thing that's 
happening in the US right now,

1059
00:49:16,890 --> 00:49:17,290
you know,
I don't,

1060
00:49:17,290 --> 00:49:18,150
I don't want my.

1061
00:49:18,150 --> 00:49:20,580
And I've got,
I've got nieces and nephews in the U.

1062
00:49:20,580 --> 00:49:21,740
S too.
And you got.

1063
00:49:21,790 --> 00:49:24,660
So I don't want them to go through that.
It would be completely heartbreak.

1064
00:49:24,670 --> 00:49:26,850
I'd be devastated if I heard that,
uh,

1065
00:49:26,970 --> 00:49:31,970
my own niece went through something like
that just because she has a Muslim name,

1066
00:49:33,120 --> 00:49:34,380
you know,
a Muslim sounding name.

1067
00:49:35,130 --> 00:49:39,300
She looks a certain way.
So it affects you at that level too.

1068
00:49:39,301 --> 00:49:41,640
So when things like that happen or you 
know,

1069
00:49:41,641 --> 00:49:42,480
I,
I recently,

1070
00:49:42,481 --> 00:49:45,090
I recently posted about this.
I have a friend who's a physician.

1071
00:49:45,780 --> 00:49:46,800
Uh,
he's,

1072
00:49:47,010 --> 00:49:47,843
and he actually,
he's in California and he went to a 

1073
00:49:50,071 --> 00:49:52,950
party recently and there was a woman who
came up to him and said,

1074
00:49:52,951 --> 00:49:53,784
you know,
you,

1075
00:49:53,800 --> 00:49:54,633
uh,
she called him a Taliban terrorists and 

1076
00:49:55,801 --> 00:49:56,634
so on,
and she was a little drunk and 

1077
00:49:59,070 --> 00:50:00,840
fortunately the people that he was 
around,

1078
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:02,250
uh,
jumped in and,

1079
00:50:02,520 --> 00:50:03,353
you know,
they defended him and they called her 

1080
00:50:05,671 --> 00:50:06,504
out on it.

1081
00:50:06,570 --> 00:50:07,330
But,
uh,

1082
00:50:07,330 --> 00:50:10,620
these are things that are happening and 
he's also an atheist by the way.

1083
00:50:10,860 --> 00:50:14,600
So he's from a Muslim background and you
know,

1084
00:50:14,610 --> 00:50:15,443
so when things like this happened,
and this is something that could happen 

1085
00:50:16,771 --> 00:50:19,200
to me as well that happened in my own 
family.

1086
00:50:19,530 --> 00:50:22,980
So on that level,
I do identify with,

1087
00:50:23,530 --> 00:50:24,660
uh,
the sort of,

1088
00:50:24,840 --> 00:50:26,730
you know,
what a lot of Muslims are going through.

1089
00:50:27,290 --> 00:50:29,570
On the other hand,
I also got a prejudice.

1090
00:50:29,571 --> 00:50:30,404
I mean,
I guess apostates get it from not only 

1091
00:50:33,380 --> 00:50:37,720
the people who target Muslims,
but the Muslims who target a oscillates.

1092
00:50:38,220 --> 00:50:40,160
Uh,
so it's a bit of a double whammy there,

1093
00:50:40,161 --> 00:50:42,860
but yeah,
so you do relate to it.

1094
00:50:42,861 --> 00:50:43,694
And this,
it's a very complicated thing when you 

1095
00:50:45,021 --> 00:50:48,800
have that mixture of ideology and 
identity is,

1096
00:50:48,860 --> 00:50:49,693
it's a very complicated thing to 
navigate and it's not as binary as 

1097
00:50:53,541 --> 00:50:57,950
simple as you know,
what you hear when you hear someone like

1098
00:50:58,160 --> 00:50:58,993
Glenn Greenwald talk about,
or someone like Donald trump talk about 

1099
00:51:00,991 --> 00:51:03,330
her do I think are sort of very similar.
Yeah.

1100
00:51:04,480 --> 00:51:05,313
Yeah.
Well that's why I phrased the question 

1101
00:51:05,920 --> 00:51:10,120
the way I did because I don't see an 
inherent contradiction there.

1102
00:51:10,330 --> 00:51:11,163
I think that everything that you've 
described sounds completely feasible to 

1103
00:51:14,511 --> 00:51:15,520
me in it.
And if anything,

1104
00:51:15,521 --> 00:51:16,354
it's not just feasible.
It sounds preferable to me because 

1105
00:51:18,581 --> 00:51:23,581
you're taking the logical and the uh,
and the secular side of your,

1106
00:51:23,920 --> 00:51:24,753
of your existence and fully 
acknowledging that and then also 

1107
00:51:27,371 --> 00:51:28,204
acknowledging your,
your history and your family and all 

1108
00:51:30,101 --> 00:51:30,791
that.
So that,

1109
00:51:30,791 --> 00:51:31,624
to me,
that to me makes full sense and more 

1110
00:51:32,921 --> 00:51:34,270
people should be trying to do that.

1111
00:51:34,690 --> 00:51:37,120
Yeah,
I think there is a Phillips Zuckerman.

1112
00:51:37,121 --> 00:51:40,000
Is this,
he's a writer who wrote a book called,

1113
00:51:40,430 --> 00:51:42,370
I think it's called living the secular 
life.

1114
00:51:42,460 --> 00:51:43,400
Um,
yeah,

1115
00:51:43,440 --> 00:51:44,273
I'm pretty sure that's what it's called 
and that he actually talks about 

1116
00:51:45,851 --> 00:51:46,684
secularizing religion.
He also did an interview with Sam 

1117
00:51:50,710 --> 00:51:51,543
Harris.
Sam Harris interviewed him for his blog 

1118
00:51:53,140 --> 00:51:53,973
and he talks about that as a very sort 
of seminal step in moving towards 

1119
00:51:58,450 --> 00:52:00,280
secularism is that,
you know,

1120
00:52:00,281 --> 00:52:01,114
you take,
you take the holidays and take the 

1121
00:52:01,991 --> 00:52:04,600
rituals you take that,
the community aspect of it,

1122
00:52:05,080 --> 00:52:06,850
how they have Sunday assemblies and 
everything.

1123
00:52:07,280 --> 00:52:08,113
Um,
so those are examples of things that 

1124
00:52:11,560 --> 00:52:13,150
people can do and how,
you know,

1125
00:52:13,270 --> 00:52:14,103
religious actually move towards 
secularism when you talked about reform 

1126
00:52:16,221 --> 00:52:18,910
Judaism,
which was,

1127
00:52:18,911 --> 00:52:20,290
which is interesting because,
you know,

1128
00:52:20,440 --> 00:52:22,570
Judaism and Islam,
again,

1129
00:52:22,600 --> 00:52:23,750
very similar,
you know,

1130
00:52:23,890 --> 00:52:24,723
how God revealed the Chron directly to 
Muhammad in the same way God supposedly 

1131
00:52:28,031 --> 00:52:31,850
revealed the Torah to um,
uh,

1132
00:52:32,200 --> 00:52:35,200
to Moses at the Tabernacle and Mount 
Sinai and so on.

1133
00:52:35,890 --> 00:52:37,610
And it was considered the literal word 
of God.

1134
00:52:37,611 --> 00:52:40,750
It was actually considered the blueprint
for creation in genesis at one point.

1135
00:52:40,751 --> 00:52:43,510
So it was meant to even predate 
creation.

1136
00:52:43,840 --> 00:52:47,260
And that's how it was thought of at a 
time.

1137
00:52:47,320 --> 00:52:49,840
And then in the late,
late 18th,

1138
00:52:49,841 --> 00:52:51,910
I think it was the,
it was the 19th century,

1139
00:52:51,920 --> 00:52:55,990
early 19th century when the reform 
Judaism movement really took hold in it,

1140
00:52:56,410 --> 00:53:00,970
it got demoted from literal word of God 
to divinely inspired,

1141
00:53:01,690 --> 00:53:05,650
suddenly something that was written by 
the hands of human beings.

1142
00:53:05,651 --> 00:53:06,630
And,
um,

1143
00:53:06,950 --> 00:53:09,880
revelation became a progressive thing,
you know,

1144
00:53:09,890 --> 00:53:13,960
so it was a quality.
They adopted a lot of secular values and

1145
00:53:13,961 --> 00:53:15,580
so on and,
and it changed.

1146
00:53:15,581 --> 00:53:16,990
So when people say,
well,

1147
00:53:16,991 --> 00:53:18,720
the Koran is infallible,
you know,

1148
00:53:18,820 --> 00:53:22,190
how are you going to change it?
And I always think thinking good,

1149
00:53:22,270 --> 00:53:23,740
the Koran,
there's precedent for that.

1150
00:53:24,130 --> 00:53:26,490
There's actually precedent for that.
Would Judaism,

1151
00:53:26,910 --> 00:53:28,890
uh,
with the Catholicism for instance,

1152
00:53:28,891 --> 00:53:29,724
I mean,
there's a lot of Catholics who approach 

1153
00:53:30,361 --> 00:53:32,040
choice.
A lot of them practice birth control.

1154
00:53:32,340 --> 00:53:33,173
Many of them,
they fornicated to their heart's 

1155
00:53:34,531 --> 00:53:35,980
content,
but you know,

1156
00:53:36,240 --> 00:53:41,080
you still go and they observe lent and 
they celebrate Christmas and Easter.

1157
00:53:41,130 --> 00:53:42,480
Nobody kicks them out of the church 
saying,

1158
00:53:42,481 --> 00:53:43,800
you know,
you're not a catholic.

1159
00:53:45,730 --> 00:53:46,421
Yeah.
Well,

1160
00:53:46,421 --> 00:53:48,880
for the record,
I told this to Peter last week,

1161
00:53:49,120 --> 00:53:51,610
but I actually went to Mount Sinai in 
1997.

1162
00:53:51,611 --> 00:53:53,410
I went to Egypt,
I went to Sinai,

1163
00:53:53,530 --> 00:53:55,870
I hiked the mountain and literally 
nothing happened.

1164
00:53:55,990 --> 00:53:56,980
I asked.
I mean,

1165
00:53:56,981 --> 00:53:59,380
I really did.
I was at that place in life,

1166
00:53:59,410 --> 00:53:59,890
uh,
you know,

1167
00:53:59,890 --> 00:54:02,350
20 or 21 or so,
or 19 and I,

1168
00:54:02,351 --> 00:54:06,290
I went there trying to have some thing 
and talk to somebody and,

1169
00:54:06,291 --> 00:54:07,870
and nobody,
nobody talked back.

1170
00:54:08,160 --> 00:54:11,060
Bad experience the first time.
You don't want to repeat it again.

1171
00:54:11,190 --> 00:54:12,023
You don't.
Alright.

1172
00:54:12,030 --> 00:54:12,863
So I want to end with this because you 
have brought up a phrase that I think 

1173
00:54:16,471 --> 00:54:17,304
you hashtagged and I want to make sure 
that when this thing takes off that 

1174
00:54:20,701 --> 00:54:21,534
you're fully credited for it and 
hopefully I'll have a little something 

1175
00:54:23,221 --> 00:54:24,054
to do with it.
But you've talked about the new center 

1176
00:54:26,100 --> 00:54:30,210
and I think it's the right phrase for 
what we've been looking for.

1177
00:54:30,211 --> 00:54:31,044
I think it fits,
it fits because we have this left right 

1178
00:54:33,661 --> 00:54:34,494
paradigm,
but it also fits the center of this 

1179
00:54:36,541 --> 00:54:38,160
liberal split between,
you know,

1180
00:54:38,161 --> 00:54:40,620
the regressives and the say classic 
liberals.

1181
00:54:40,830 --> 00:54:43,800
So can you just tell me a little bit 
more about what you think the new center

1182
00:54:43,801 --> 00:54:46,980
is and what we can all do to,
to get people there?

1183
00:54:48,280 --> 00:54:49,113
Well,
it's basically what I described here 

1184
00:54:51,950 --> 00:54:54,110
when it comes to purely this aspect of 
Islam,

1185
00:54:54,111 --> 00:54:57,650
Islam and jihadism and sort of religious
extremism of,

1186
00:54:57,770 --> 00:54:59,270
even though that's a misnomer,
um,

1187
00:54:59,490 --> 00:55:00,323
it's,
it's about separating ideology from 

1188
00:55:02,361 --> 00:55:03,194
identity.
It's about being able to stand up for 

1189
00:55:05,121 --> 00:55:05,954
the rights of people,
but at the same time challenge ideas 

1190
00:55:08,210 --> 00:55:11,450
when you attack and challenge ideas.
That's how society has moved forward.

1191
00:55:11,960 --> 00:55:16,490
A few attack and Dbas people.
That's what splits people out.

1192
00:55:16,520 --> 00:55:20,300
That's what actually rips us apart.
So being able to do,

1193
00:55:21,220 --> 00:55:23,390
to make that distinction is very 
important.

1194
00:55:23,391 --> 00:55:25,370
I don't think either side is doing it 
here.

1195
00:55:25,390 --> 00:55:27,960
I think that the center is more rational
and on a,

1196
00:55:28,270 --> 00:55:29,720
on a,
on a broader level too.

1197
00:55:29,721 --> 00:55:31,970
I've always found it bizarre that,
you know,

1198
00:55:31,971 --> 00:55:34,910
if you're fiscally conservative and then
you know,

1199
00:55:34,960 --> 00:55:39,960
you suddenly you have to be prolife why 
does all of that go together?

1200
00:55:40,161 --> 00:55:44,730
I think it's absolutely ridiculous.
People should be able to have different,

1201
00:55:44,760 --> 00:55:45,470
uh,
you know,

1202
00:55:45,470 --> 00:55:47,390
I should be able to think that,
okay,

1203
00:55:47,660 --> 00:55:49,790
I believe in these fiscally conservative
principles,

1204
00:55:50,510 --> 00:55:53,780
time I'm socially liberal or I could 
have libertarian presented,

1205
00:55:53,781 --> 00:55:54,614
but there's no rational.
I don't think you can be a rational 

1206
00:55:57,380 --> 00:56:01,460
thinking person and be aligned with one 
side or the other.

1207
00:56:02,520 --> 00:56:03,720
Well,
that's a whole other topic.

1208
00:56:03,721 --> 00:56:07,650
Figuring out how the politicians figured
out to make everything a wedge issue.

1209
00:56:07,790 --> 00:56:10,230
So somehow gay rights if you were for 
gay rights,

1210
00:56:10,350 --> 00:56:12,330
you are also for,
you know,

1211
00:56:12,331 --> 00:56:14,790
low taxes,
like it just doesn't make any sense.

1212
00:56:14,990 --> 00:56:15,823
Um,
do you think there's any chance for a 

1213
00:56:17,251 --> 00:56:19,050
political movement with that?
Because when you,

1214
00:56:19,051 --> 00:56:21,750
I saw it,
you did Hashtag new center and I thought

1215
00:56:21,751 --> 00:56:22,584
maybe there's politics.
They're not just not just this sort of 

1216
00:56:25,631 --> 00:56:26,464
internal,
a discussion that will all have and 

1217
00:56:28,481 --> 00:56:29,314
hopefully get it out there more.
But actually this could maybe be a 

1218
00:56:31,601 --> 00:56:32,560
political movement.

1219
00:56:33,190 --> 00:56:34,023
I would like that.
And that's why I brought up the whole 

1220
00:56:35,341 --> 00:56:37,830
fiscally conservative socially liberal 
thing is because,

1221
00:56:38,090 --> 00:56:39,820
um,
when,

1222
00:56:40,470 --> 00:56:43,950
when I grew up on tv,
you had the 6:00

1223
00:56:43,951 --> 00:56:45,780
news and the 11:00
news and you know,

1224
00:56:45,790 --> 00:56:48,870
you saw everybody watched that,
whether you're liberal or Conservative,

1225
00:56:49,140 --> 00:56:51,600
I mean 1984 and Ronald Reagan won.
I mean,

1226
00:56:51,601 --> 00:56:54,570
he won California.
He won 49 states out of 50.

1227
00:56:55,140 --> 00:56:59,070
I'm not endorsing Ronald Reagan or 
seeing anything against him either,

1228
00:56:59,490 --> 00:57:00,323
but I,
what I'm saying is that things weren't 

1229
00:57:01,741 --> 00:57:03,630
as polarized.
You're going to later on,

1230
00:57:03,631 --> 00:57:04,464
you had 24 hour cable news,
so you had Fox News on one side and 

1231
00:57:06,691 --> 00:57:11,691
Msnbc on the other and everybody just 
watched what their own echo chamber was.

1232
00:57:12,001 --> 00:57:12,834
I mean,
it'll be every channel had its own echo 

1233
00:57:13,441 --> 00:57:14,274
chamber with the blogosphere and with 
the Internet that became even more 

1234
00:57:17,250 --> 00:57:18,083
pronounced.
So there's a lot of polarization and I 

1235
00:57:20,341 --> 00:57:21,174
think it's getting to a point and we're 
seeing this with the regressive less 

1236
00:57:23,241 --> 00:57:25,600
than I left on the trompe and right.
Um,

1237
00:57:26,040 --> 00:57:27,500
uh,
you know,

1238
00:57:27,590 --> 00:57:28,423
I think that there is that kind of 
polarization is something that a lot of 

1239
00:57:32,010 --> 00:57:34,280
reasonable rational,
uh,

1240
00:57:34,290 --> 00:57:38,520
people are not feeling.
It's not working for them,

1241
00:57:38,670 --> 00:57:42,960
they're actually frustrated by it and I 
really hope that they do.

1242
00:57:43,690 --> 00:57:44,523
They're okay to let go of the 
traditional left and right labels 

1243
00:57:47,431 --> 00:57:49,890
because I practically meaningless right 
now.

1244
00:57:49,891 --> 00:57:50,820
I don't think they mean anything.

1245
00:57:51,720 --> 00:57:52,553
Yeah,

1246
00:57:52,770 --> 00:57:55,680
just be human beings thinking human 
beings.

1247
00:57:56,410 --> 00:57:57,243
I love that.
Perfect ending and I love the fact that 

1248
00:57:59,261 --> 00:58:02,050
we've connected and you'll always have 
an ally over here.

1249
00:58:02,051 --> 00:58:02,884
So next time,
hopefully we can do this in person when 

1250
00:58:04,961 --> 00:58:07,750
you make it out to Los Angeles.
So I want to thank Ali Rizvi.

1251
00:58:07,850 --> 00:58:09,730
His book comes out next year,
but in the meantime,

1252
00:58:09,731 --> 00:58:13,270
you can follow his regressive smack 
downs on twitter.

1253
00:58:13,540 --> 00:58:15,520
Thank you guys for watching and we'll 
see you next time.
