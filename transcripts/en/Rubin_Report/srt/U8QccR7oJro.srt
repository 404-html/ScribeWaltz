00:00:02,610 --> 00:00:02,880
During

2
00:00:02,880 --> 00:00:05,820
the direct message last week,
I mentioned how people from all over the

3
00:00:05,821 --> 00:00:06,654
world watching and listening to the 
Rubin report are connecting through the 

4
00:00:09,421 --> 00:00:10,254
power of ideas.
Immediately after we posted the video 

5
00:00:12,961 --> 00:00:13,794
online,
the comments section lit up with people 

6
00:00:15,571 --> 00:00:18,720
chiming in from around the globe.
For those of you keeping score,

7
00:00:18,721 --> 00:00:21,900
here are the countries I heard from in 
no particular order,

8
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:23,580
Macedonia,
Hungary,

9
00:00:23,581 --> 00:00:24,960
Poland,
Lebanon,

10
00:00:24,990 --> 00:00:26,310
Denmark,
Ukraine,

11
00:00:26,311 --> 00:00:27,770
United Kingdom,

United States,

13
00:00:29,341 --> 00:00:30,300
Italy,
Arac,

14
00:00:30,310 --> 00:00:32,160
Slovakia,
Israel greased.

15
00:00:32,190 --> 00:00:34,200
I won Germany,
Russia,

16
00:00:34,201 --> 00:00:35,580
Switzerland,
Argentina,

17
00:00:35,581 --> 00:00:36,750
Ireland,
Belgium,

18
00:00:36,751 --> 00:00:37,890
Georgia,
Netherlands,

19
00:00:37,891 --> 00:00:39,780
Bangladesh,
South Africa,

20
00:00:39,781 --> 00:00:41,640
India and New Zealand,
Norway,

21
00:00:41,641 --> 00:00:43,080
Brazil,
Australia,

22
00:00:43,081 --> 00:00:44,520
Portugal,
Spain,

23
00:00:44,521 --> 00:00:49,230
and even North Korea by my count.
That's 35 countries and that's just from

24
00:00:49,231 --> 00:00:50,064
the people who happened to comment on 
the video or tweet to me wherever you 

25
00:00:53,671 --> 00:00:54,720
are,
you are a living,

26
00:00:54,721 --> 00:00:59,640
breathing example of why ideas about 
secular values and free speech matter.

27
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:00,713
For my interviews to you guys,
furthering the conversations on social 

28
00:01:03,391 --> 00:01:08,391
media were igniting ideas and people all
over the world who share the same ideals

29
00:01:08,670 --> 00:01:10,160
as the civil rights activist.

30
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:12,660
Medgar Evers said,
you can kill a man,

31
00:01:12,750 --> 00:01:13,583
but you can't kill an idea,
so whether you're listening to this in 

32
00:01:16,181 --> 00:01:19,020
the comforts of your vacation home on 
the Italian coast,

33
00:01:19,021 --> 00:01:23,390
while on a bus in India or in an 
apartment complex in war torn Iraq,

34
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:24,473
you're a piece of the puzzle of 
reclaiming liberalism and having honest 

35
00:01:28,021 --> 00:01:31,380
conversations even with those whom we 
disagree,

36
00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:32,693
ideas of brought us together,
but I think we're just at the precipice 

37
00:01:35,011 --> 00:01:39,240
of what this conversation about free 
speech and liberalism could become.

38
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:43,440
So now I want you guys to be part of the
show more than ever before.

39
00:01:43,441 --> 00:01:46,380
I think we can do something bigger than 
just emailing,

40
00:01:46,381 --> 00:01:47,790
tweeting,
and facebooking.

41
00:01:47,791 --> 00:01:48,624
I want to talk directly to you.
Consider this my official request to 

42
00:01:52,111 --> 00:01:53,280
have you.
Yeah,

43
00:01:53,340 --> 00:01:54,173
you on the Rubin report.
We're going to take a group of five 

44
00:01:57,421 --> 00:01:58,254
viewers from five different countries 
and I will interview you via skype for 

45
00:02:01,201 --> 00:02:02,034
10 minutes.

46
00:02:02,250 --> 00:02:04,890
Posting them all as one complete 
episode.

47
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:07,470
I want to know who you are,
what you do,

48
00:02:07,471 --> 00:02:10,740
why you think the conversations we've 
been having here are important,

49
00:02:10,980 --> 00:02:13,950
and how you came to think the way you do
together.

50
00:02:13,951 --> 00:02:16,770
I think we can amplify our message of 
conversation,

51
00:02:16,771 --> 00:02:20,280
human rights and secular values in an 
exponential way.

52
00:02:20,490 --> 00:02:22,440
I don't care if you're a religious 
atheist,

53
00:02:22,441 --> 00:02:23,730
Republican,
Democrat,

54
00:02:23,731 --> 00:02:24,451
black,
white,

55
00:02:24,451 --> 00:02:27,090
gay or straight.
What I care about is,

56
00:02:27,210 --> 00:02:28,140
yeah,
you got it.

57
00:02:28,170 --> 00:02:29,003
Your ideas with this in mind,
joining me this week are my friend and 

58
00:02:31,861 --> 00:02:33,340
former guests,
Feisal Syeda,

59
00:02:33,341 --> 00:02:36,120
Al Mutar and first time guest,
Melissa Chen.

60
00:02:36,150 --> 00:02:36,983
Feisal was born in Iraq and now lives in
New York where he works with 

61
00:02:39,481 --> 00:02:40,314
movements.org
and organization dedicated to helping 

62
00:02:42,571 --> 00:02:46,410
people escape closed societies.
Melissa is from Singapore,

63
00:02:46,411 --> 00:02:51,411
got her phd at Mit and is the manager of
the global secular humanist movement.

64
00:02:52,290 --> 00:02:56,820
These are two people who are using their
voices to help those who need it most,

65
00:02:56,940 --> 00:02:58,800
and now it's time to make your voice 
heard.

66
00:02:58,801 --> 00:02:59,634
To go to Ora dot TV slash Rubin report 
or click the link in the description 

67
00:03:02,921 --> 00:03:06,730
right down below and let us know why you
want to be on the Rubin report.

68
00:03:06,940 --> 00:03:09,130
Oh,
in complementing the host probably won't

69
00:03:09,131 --> 00:03:09,964
hurt your chances.

70
00:03:12,730 --> 00:03:13,563
My guest this week,
our feisal site on Matar and Melissa 

71
00:03:16,060 --> 00:03:16,893
Chen,
they worked together at the global 

72
00:03:17,711 --> 00:03:18,544
secular humanist movement,
a platform committed to the use of 

73
00:03:21,431 --> 00:03:22,264
critical reason,
factual evidence and scientific methods 

74
00:03:25,361 --> 00:03:26,194
of inquiry rather than faith and 
mysticism in seeking solutions to human 

75
00:03:29,831 --> 00:03:33,520
problems and answers to important human 
questions.

76
00:03:33,820 --> 00:03:34,653
That was a serious intro.
You guys write a nice boiler plate 

77
00:03:37,001 --> 00:03:37,840
there.
I got to tell you.

78
00:03:37,870 --> 00:03:38,920
Well,
I tried my best.

79
00:03:38,950 --> 00:03:41,620
You gave me all.
Those are all the buzzwords that we talk

80
00:03:41,621 --> 00:03:42,460
about all the time,
right?

81
00:03:42,461 --> 00:03:43,450
Yeah,
exactly.

82
00:03:43,540 --> 00:03:44,151
Yeah.
And,

83
00:03:44,151 --> 00:03:46,330
and uh,
the word committed is the most important

84
00:03:46,331 --> 00:03:47,230
one.
Committed,

85
00:03:47,650 --> 00:03:50,050
committed to that.
These principles,

86
00:03:50,340 --> 00:03:52,270
because it's very hard to be consistent 
these days.

87
00:03:52,540 --> 00:03:55,350
It is hard to because especially as you 
know,

88
00:03:55,450 --> 00:03:56,620
the,
some of the folks,

89
00:03:56,621 --> 00:03:59,070
we conserve our allies,
but they,

90
00:03:59,470 --> 00:04:02,060
they have their mind on Christianity 
and,

91
00:04:02,140 --> 00:04:02,830
and other stuff.

92
00:04:02,830 --> 00:04:05,740
They changed their mind.
So the word committed here is I think is

93
00:04:05,741 --> 00:04:06,930
the most important one.
Right.

94
00:04:06,970 --> 00:04:09,610
So you're itching to get right into it.
Get into.

95
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:10,593
I want to get into a fight,
but get into flow all the way from New 

96
00:04:13,700 --> 00:04:14,533
York with.
Yeah.

97
00:04:14,690 --> 00:04:15,523
Alright.
So we're gonna talk about our friend of 

98
00:04:16,271 --> 00:04:17,320
course.
Of course.

99
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:19,240
A Pfizer.
You've been on the show before.

100
00:04:19,241 --> 00:04:19,960
I have,
yeah.

101
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:21,310
Thank you for inviting me again.
Yeah,

102
00:04:21,311 --> 00:04:24,680
my pleasure.
So you guys work together and uh,

103
00:04:24,820 --> 00:04:27,250
I want to do a little bit just on your 
histories first.

104
00:04:27,490 --> 00:04:29,650
So since we've had feisal here,
let's start with you Melissa.

105
00:04:29,651 --> 00:04:32,560
So you are originally from Singapore.
I moved here,

106
00:04:32,850 --> 00:04:35,750
but I moved here in 2004 for college.
Um,

107
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:39,830
worked and then went to Grad school and 
continue working.

108
00:04:39,831 --> 00:04:41,900
I love it.
And I,

109
00:04:41,930 --> 00:04:42,763
you know,
I got sold the American dream and the 

110
00:04:44,931 --> 00:04:46,790
American ideals,
I think,

111
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:47,713
you know,
in part it's the same thing that drew 

112
00:04:49,461 --> 00:04:50,740
both of us here,
you know,

113
00:04:50,741 --> 00:04:51,070
we,
we,

114
00:04:51,070 --> 00:04:52,700
we couldn't have more different 
backgrounds.

115
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:58,120
Phase all grew up under a dictatorship 
in Baghdad and he has only known war and

116
00:04:59,061 --> 00:04:59,894
strife his whole life,
but I've had an interesting parallel 

117
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:06,830
childhood it Singapore where it's a 
benevolent dictatorship,

118
00:05:06,831 --> 00:05:07,460
so,
you know,

119
00:05:07,460 --> 00:05:10,930
he grew up under those circumstances,
but it was safe and,

120
00:05:10,980 --> 00:05:12,920
and,
and very prosperous,

121
00:05:12,921 --> 00:05:17,210
you know,
city and life there is stable.

122
00:05:17,450 --> 00:05:19,190
Yeah.
So I think that people,

123
00:05:19,191 --> 00:05:22,160
at least in America,
I'm trying to expand some,

124
00:05:22,430 --> 00:05:26,000
some worldly knowledge on people,
but I feel like people don't really know

125
00:05:26,001 --> 00:05:26,834
anything about Singapore.
So when you say a benevolent 

126
00:05:28,551 --> 00:05:29,470
dictatorship,
what,

127
00:05:29,490 --> 00:05:30,323
what does that even mean?

128
00:05:30,690 --> 00:05:31,523
Well,
it's been a single party state since 

129
00:05:34,501 --> 00:05:35,334
1965.
One government has one party has ruled 

130
00:05:39,331 --> 00:05:40,164
the country since,
since that time ever since it's gained 

131
00:05:42,541 --> 00:05:44,370
independence.
Um,

132
00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:45,780
and,
and they are,

133
00:05:46,170 --> 00:05:48,100
you know,
economic freedoms are,

134
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:48,993
are,
are extremely well developed in 

135
00:05:50,611 --> 00:05:51,444
Singapore,
I think Heritage Foundation listed as 

136
00:05:52,951 --> 00:05:56,100
two out of 180 on the economic freedom 
index.

137
00:05:56,130 --> 00:05:58,700
Right.
But if you look at political freedom,

138
00:05:58,730 --> 00:06:00,380
you know,
freedom of expression,

139
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:03,350
freedom of the press,
it's virtually nonexistent.

140
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:07,370
So basically there's freedom to sort of 
pursue the work that you want,

141
00:06:07,371 --> 00:06:10,070
but not necessarily say the things that 
you want.

142
00:06:10,130 --> 00:06:10,963
It is a neo liberal contradiction in 
that regard because it's extremely 

143
00:06:16,041 --> 00:06:19,520
fiscally austere,
low taxes,

144
00:06:19,521 --> 00:06:22,880
free trade deregulation.
It's all the buzzwords that,

145
00:06:22,881 --> 00:06:25,370
you know,
the right wing economists,

146
00:06:25,450 --> 00:06:27,440
you know,
love right by it.

147
00:06:27,441 --> 00:06:28,900
On the other hand,
um,

148
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:30,321
you know,
I,

149
00:06:30,321 --> 00:06:31,154
I think it's sort of throwing a wrench 
into Milton Friedman's capitalism and 

150
00:06:35,241 --> 00:06:36,500
freedom.
His theory about,

151
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:37,633
he said that economic freedom is a 
necessary precondition to political 

152
00:06:42,141 --> 00:06:45,380
freedom and civil freedoms and that's 
not really happening.

153
00:06:45,660 --> 00:06:48,530
So that's really interesting.
So Singapore sorta got half of it,

154
00:06:48,531 --> 00:06:50,450
right,
because the economic part,

155
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:54,170
but not the social part in the political
part right now.

156
00:06:54,171 --> 00:06:55,010
Of course you come

157
00:06:55,130 --> 00:06:58,870
from both of them are in my country.
We got everything.

158
00:06:59,310 --> 00:07:00,143
So she's got one for two and you got a 
little bit has to do with some of the 

159
00:07:04,871 --> 00:07:05,704
things that we did here in America.
So for the people that don't know your 

160
00:07:07,121 --> 00:07:07,954
story,
give me like a two minute recap of 

161
00:07:09,340 --> 00:07:11,600
growing up in Iraq and catches up on.
Well,

162
00:07:11,610 --> 00:07:12,443
I mean,
I was born in Iraq and I was born in 

163
00:07:13,751 --> 00:07:16,910
Babylon and raised in Baghdad.
Uh,

164
00:07:17,230 --> 00:07:20,350
my first year was under Saddam Hussein,
the dictatorship,

165
00:07:20,351 --> 00:07:24,430
and then afterwards the US invasion of 
Iraq happened and uh,

166
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:27,330
continuing with civil war,
I mean,

167
00:07:27,340 --> 00:07:28,173
my spark for activism was kind of a 
mixed of because after the intervention 

168
00:07:32,630 --> 00:07:33,463
we had the first rocket elections and I 
saw the rise of secretary and politics 

169
00:07:37,511 --> 00:07:38,344
and I,
since I was a young boy back then I was 

170
00:07:40,511 --> 00:07:41,344
advocating for secular values and uh,
just to prevent the rise of terrorist 

171
00:07:48,221 --> 00:07:49,054
groups like what we have right now 
because I was afraid that if I want to 

172
00:07:50,911 --> 00:07:54,340
grow up,
takes over the other and that's good.

173
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:58,420
Not obviously go.
And um,

174
00:07:58,630 --> 00:08:00,490
I left.
So within,

175
00:08:00,491 --> 00:08:03,470
like the Sol was rising,
I lost members of my lost.

176
00:08:03,490 --> 00:08:06,260
My brother lost my cousin.
I was also a lot,

177
00:08:06,270 --> 00:08:09,160
so friends and the had to leave Iraq in 
2009.

178
00:08:09,270 --> 00:08:13,060
Um,
and actually a year afterwards I started

179
00:08:13,061 --> 00:08:16,840
like the pages total global secular 
humanist movement that eventually became

180
00:08:16,841 --> 00:08:19,770
one of the largest in the world.
I left Iraq,

181
00:08:19,780 --> 00:08:24,780
I went into country close to Singapore 
and Malaysia and I applied for asylum,

182
00:08:25,061 --> 00:08:25,894
uh,
through the NHCR United Nations 

183
00:08:28,090 --> 00:08:29,620
Committee for Refugees and I got 
accepted to come to America.

184
00:08:29,690 --> 00:08:30,930
Yeah.
So that 13.

185
00:08:31,090 --> 00:08:31,923
So that's why I wanted to have you both 
on together because I think it's really 

186
00:08:34,691 --> 00:08:35,524
interesting people that come from 
different places and as you say on the 

187
00:08:37,901 --> 00:08:40,420
show all the time,
the idea is we talk about here transcend

188
00:08:40,421 --> 00:08:41,160
borders,

189
00:08:41,160 --> 00:08:45,090
they transcend ethnicity and nationality
and all of those things.

190
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:47,400
So when you were there and when you were
growing up,

191
00:08:47,401 --> 00:08:51,300
there was,
did you have a political awakening while

192
00:08:51,301 --> 00:08:52,134
you were there?
Did you realize that you couldn't say 

193
00:08:53,491 --> 00:08:55,560
some of the things that you wanted to 
say in kind of stuff?

194
00:08:55,770 --> 00:08:56,760
Absolutely.
So,

195
00:08:56,761 --> 00:08:58,180
um,
Singapore,

196
00:08:58,181 --> 00:08:58,650
it late,
you know,

197
00:08:58,650 --> 00:09:01,620
when you first entered,
when somebody learns that I am from this

198
00:09:01,621 --> 00:09:03,930
country,
they will say one or two things.

199
00:09:04,140 --> 00:09:06,730
The first one is I heard chewing gum is 
banned.

200
00:09:06,810 --> 00:09:07,280
I.
Whoa,

201
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:09,060
I heard you can't bring bubble gum into 
true.

202
00:09:09,290 --> 00:09:10,170
Yes,
it is true.

203
00:09:10,171 --> 00:09:14,280
Every chewing gum it used to be that 
they've relaxed it a little so,

204
00:09:14,281 --> 00:09:16,960
so you can't purchase it now.
Um,

205
00:09:17,010 --> 00:09:19,230
you can't purchase chewing gum there.
It and it's for very,

206
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:21,330
um,
kind of silly reasons.

207
00:09:21,930 --> 00:09:23,750
Possibly back in the 19 eighties,
you know,

208
00:09:23,751 --> 00:09:25,710
Singapore was,
was developing economically,

209
00:09:25,711 --> 00:09:26,240
right.
But,

210
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:28,110
but you can develop really fast 
economically,

211
00:09:28,111 --> 00:09:28,944
but the people's mindsets and civility 
and tragedy of the common sort of 

212
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:35,970
mindset hasn't had not developed.
So they went litter,

213
00:09:36,210 --> 00:09:37,043
you know,
you stick your chewing gum on the doors 

214
00:09:38,461 --> 00:09:40,880
of the trains and then it gets stuck.
And so the government was like,

215
00:09:40,950 --> 00:09:44,370
we're not going to spend tax dollars 
cleaning this up so you can't handle the

216
00:09:44,371 --> 00:09:45,900
chewing gum.
We're going to take it away.

217
00:09:46,020 --> 00:09:48,000
Wow.
So that talk about it and authority.

218
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:49,673
Autocratic.
Yes.

219
00:09:49,980 --> 00:09:53,730
Really at a very micro level,
like how authoritarian the government.

220
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:54,980
Yeah.
And that's,

221
00:09:55,010 --> 00:09:56,520
that's a good example.
The second one is,

222
00:09:56,521 --> 00:09:57,430
you know,
if one of the,

223
00:09:57,470 --> 00:09:58,303
the,
the sort of the best gifts you can get 

224
00:10:00,781 --> 00:10:03,830
in Singapore for like tourists to bring 
home that,

225
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:04,673
that people usually get is a t shirt 
that says Singapore is a fine city and 

226
00:10:09,630 --> 00:10:12,000
on it they're all the different fines 
that you can get,

227
00:10:12,001 --> 00:10:13,710
like you can not eat on the,
on the public,

228
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:18,980
the public train systems and it's just a
country with very strong rule of law and

229
00:10:20,010 --> 00:10:20,843
all sorts of,
all sorts of rules that you can't do 

230
00:10:23,011 --> 00:10:23,844
this and you can't do that and 
everything under the guise of 

231
00:10:26,850 --> 00:10:28,560
maintaining social harmony.

232
00:10:29,010 --> 00:10:29,843
No,
I assume it's some level that probably 

233
00:10:31,211 --> 00:10:33,420
works right at some level.
The social,

234
00:10:33,421 --> 00:10:33,700
Huh?

235
00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:35,020
We have not had,
you know,

236
00:10:35,030 --> 00:10:37,990
radicalization of our Sunni Muslim 
population.

237
00:10:38,390 --> 00:10:39,223
Not,
not as much as any other country 

238
00:10:40,300 --> 00:10:42,850
actually I would say.
And it's been largely,

239
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:44,020
you know,
you've had,

240
00:10:44,260 --> 00:10:45,910
you have Christians,
Hindus,

241
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:47,980
Buddhists,
Muslims,

242
00:10:47,981 --> 00:10:50,890
living very harmoniously together.
We've not had any incidents.

243
00:10:50,891 --> 00:10:54,970
So there is something to be said about,
about the methods of top down,

244
00:10:54,971 --> 00:10:55,804
institutionalization of social harmony.
The problem is that manifests itself in 

245
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:02,080
sedition laws,
blasphemy laws,

246
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:03,453
and as recently as last year,
it was used to throw a 17 year old 

247
00:11:08,050 --> 00:11:13,050
blogger into jail for wounding the the 
feelings of religious people.

248
00:11:14,170 --> 00:11:19,170
All he did was a say some stuff about 
Jesus Christ and twink,

249
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:20,313
at least 20 grown up adults in Singapore
felt offended enough to file a police 

250
00:11:24,821 --> 00:11:28,540
report and they threw a 17 year old and 
to Dale.

251
00:11:28,690 --> 00:11:29,523
Right?
So we've talked a little bit about what 

252
00:11:31,061 --> 00:11:31,894
they've done to bloggers in Bangladesh 
and Singapore and you've connected me 

253
00:11:35,111 --> 00:11:37,660
with the Bangladeshi blogger who I'm 
going to have on soon.

254
00:11:38,710 --> 00:11:41,980
These are the people that we need to be 
caring about more,

255
00:11:41,981 --> 00:11:42,814
right?
Because these are the people that you 

256
00:11:44,111 --> 00:11:47,380
guys could have been had you not left.
Yeah,

257
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:48,273
I mean they.
I mean everyone knows like whatever one 

258
00:11:50,921 --> 00:11:51,754
of these,
one of these folks get killed or like 

259
00:11:53,110 --> 00:11:54,070
what happened in Bangladesh

260
00:11:54,070 --> 00:11:54,903
or do I be a good job?
We know that these guys are the 

261
00:11:57,371 --> 00:11:58,204
solution.
We know that they stand for the same 

262
00:12:01,481 --> 00:12:02,530
values.
What we stand for,

263
00:12:02,531 --> 00:12:05,380
and we know the data,
the best counter they created.

264
00:12:05,381 --> 00:12:08,470
The best counter narrative to extremist 
I the,

265
00:12:08,650 --> 00:12:11,160
like the Sam Harris of Saudi Arabia.
Yes.

266
00:12:11,380 --> 00:12:12,213
He's an intellectual who has advocated 
for great values that in a country that 

267
00:12:16,271 --> 00:12:17,104
is as extreme as Saudi Arabia,
they wouldn't have changed the world in 

268
00:12:20,470 --> 00:12:21,303
Saudi Arabia.
That is one of the main exporter of 

269
00:12:22,900 --> 00:12:25,720
Wahhabi ideology that killed the 
bungalow bloggers that,

270
00:12:25,930 --> 00:12:26,763
that created the Taliban,
which a country that has nuclear 

271
00:12:28,931 --> 00:12:30,150
weapons.
Um,

272
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:33,150
so yeah,
I mean we have to,

273
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:34,033
they are our best resource that we 
should always continue to help them as 

274
00:12:37,421 --> 00:12:38,860
much as we can and whenever we can.

275
00:12:38,950 --> 00:12:39,783
Yeah.
So when you were there and you saw this 

276
00:12:41,681 --> 00:12:44,380
sort of authoritarianism,
when did you realize,

277
00:12:44,381 --> 00:12:47,110
all right,
if I'm gonna Express what's in me,

278
00:12:47,111 --> 00:12:48,220
I may have to leave.

279
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:51,720
I started realized that in high school,
um,

280
00:12:52,150 --> 00:12:52,840
in,
in,

281
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:54,090
in Singapore,
many,

282
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:56,100
many of the best schools,
like at the top,

283
00:12:56,310 --> 00:12:57,300
you know,
in academia,

284
00:12:57,790 --> 00:12:59,310
um,
they were religious schools,

285
00:12:59,340 --> 00:13:00,173
you know,
it's just like a sort of a stage of the 

286
00:13:02,131 --> 00:13:04,110
colonial era.
When the British came,

287
00:13:04,111 --> 00:13:04,944
it was a British colony and,
and you had all the missionaries from 

288
00:13:07,141 --> 00:13:07,860
France,
from,

289
00:13:07,860 --> 00:13:08,671
from,
from Europe.

290
00:13:08,671 --> 00:13:11,640
They came to set up schools to educate 
the locals.

291
00:13:12,380 --> 00:13:17,380
And so this became associated with a 
economics like high academic standards.

292
00:13:17,700 --> 00:13:19,170
So I ended up going to,
you know,

293
00:13:19,380 --> 00:13:20,213
a methodist schools which were 
associated with a very high academic 

294
00:13:24,211 --> 00:13:24,840
standards.
Right.

295
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:26,240
Did you grow up methodist?
Yes.

296
00:13:26,490 --> 00:13:27,810
And I did.
And I did.

297
00:13:28,380 --> 00:13:29,760
So,
so the religious,

298
00:13:30,570 --> 00:13:31,403
the religious schools,
where are quite a force to reckon with 

299
00:13:34,050 --> 00:13:39,050
in Singapore and in producing graduates.
And I guess I realized that,

300
00:13:42,091 --> 00:13:42,924
I mean this is a country that is very 
self enforcing in terms of political 

301
00:13:47,611 --> 00:13:48,444
correctness.

302
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:51,240
If you can't,
you know,

303
00:13:51,241 --> 00:13:54,690
there's all sorts of rules and you,
the reason people don't,

304
00:13:54,950 --> 00:13:58,660
don't do something or don't litter is 
because there's,

305
00:13:58,730 --> 00:14:02,130
there's a fine waiting to happen.
So,

306
00:14:02,131 --> 00:14:02,964
so the motivation to,
to do something or to not do something 

307
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:10,740
is completely extrinsic.
So we're all self policing each other.

308
00:14:11,490 --> 00:14:13,530
And I,
I sort of,

309
00:14:13,550 --> 00:14:14,940
you know,
bought into the,

310
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:15,833
the,
uh,

311
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:19,260
sort of ideal of the United States,
the first amendment,

312
00:14:19,530 --> 00:14:20,363
the freedom of expression,
freedom of speech because I was always 

313
00:14:22,591 --> 00:14:24,510
that rebellious,
you know,

314
00:14:24,780 --> 00:14:29,160
skeptic in my circle,
in my religious circle and,

315
00:14:29,161 --> 00:14:29,994
and school,
which is pretty much overlapped at that 

316
00:14:31,951 --> 00:14:33,420
point.
Um,

317
00:14:33,510 --> 00:14:36,360
and that's when I realized I need to get
out.

318
00:14:36,530 --> 00:14:38,510
You really need to get out if I,
if I need it to,

319
00:14:38,550 --> 00:14:40,770
if I want it to broaden my mind and 
fulfill that.

320
00:14:40,950 --> 00:14:41,783
Yeah.
I'm curious when you hear the phrase 

321
00:14:43,141 --> 00:14:47,250
self policing in a place like Singapore 
and their self policing because of fines

322
00:14:47,430 --> 00:14:49,980
and sort of this authoritarian thing.
So one of the things I've been saying on

323
00:14:49,981 --> 00:14:52,100
the short time is that we now self 
policing

324
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:54,980
ourselves in America.
So it's not coming.

325
00:14:55,110 --> 00:14:57,380
You know,
we always used to fear the idea that the

326
00:14:57,381 --> 00:15:00,080
government is what's going to come in 
and take away our Frisco.

327
00:15:00,300 --> 00:15:03,920
But now it's we're doing it to ourselves
and what's happening in academia,

328
00:15:03,921 --> 00:15:05,300
which I want to talk to you guys a 
little bit,

329
00:15:05,420 --> 00:15:06,253
but when you hear that,
does that make you crazy knowings from 

330
00:15:08,211 --> 00:15:09,620
where you came?
Exactly.

331
00:15:10,460 --> 00:15:12,880
Nineteen 84,
but four people,

332
00:15:13,170 --> 00:15:14,080
right?
It's backwards.

333
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:16,260
It's something like 1984.
Yeah.

334
00:15:16,261 --> 00:15:18,290
I mean,
to be honest,

335
00:15:18,340 --> 00:15:19,040
I,
when I,

336
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:23,660
before I came to United States,
I had like a very good image of what,

337
00:15:23,661 --> 00:15:25,820
like when I came to America,
the people,

338
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:26,713
especially the people who believe in St 
Louis with as I am the secular liberals 

339
00:15:29,151 --> 00:15:29,984
of the,
of the West with just give and I will 

340
00:15:34,060 --> 00:15:36,170
say at first because the movement has 
changed.

341
00:15:36,171 --> 00:15:38,570
Write something on the left has changed 
over the last couple of years.

342
00:15:38,570 --> 00:15:39,403
So when you moved here,
I'm guessing maybe it was a little more 

343
00:15:40,701 --> 00:15:41,870
welcoming.
I mean it was,

344
00:15:41,900 --> 00:15:42,733
I mean it was welcoming,
but I thought it would be more 

345
00:15:44,511 --> 00:15:45,344
welcoming.
I didn't know that there was this huge 

346
00:15:46,371 --> 00:15:49,040
splits.
The fact that if I can,

347
00:15:49,070 --> 00:15:53,170
if anybody can be advocating for same 
sex marriage in a,

348
00:15:53,171 --> 00:15:55,340
in a western country,
it's totally okay.

349
00:15:55,520 --> 00:15:57,710
But the moment you talk about it in a 
Muslim country,

350
00:15:57,711 --> 00:15:59,140
it becomes,
yeah,

351
00:15:59,290 --> 00:16:00,020
yeah,
yeah.

352
00:16:00,020 --> 00:16:04,400
And I didn't know about these dynamics 
that when you talk about the same values

353
00:16:04,401 --> 00:16:05,234
that the American liberals that have 
cared for when you move it to a 

354
00:16:06,981 --> 00:16:07,814
universal or another country,
you would immediately be called a 

355
00:16:10,611 --> 00:16:14,090
racist.
And so when I got into that,

356
00:16:14,150 --> 00:16:15,970
I started getting attacked left or 
right,

357
00:16:16,230 --> 00:16:17,270
or like,
oh,

358
00:16:17,271 --> 00:16:21,050
what I'm saying is that I support same 
sex marriage.

359
00:16:21,051 --> 00:16:24,380
And they like,
oh well that is a form of colonialism.

360
00:16:25,410 --> 00:16:26,243
And I'm like,
no fucking getting made because you're 

361
00:16:28,940 --> 00:16:31,010
saying the same thing for like the 
United States.

362
00:16:31,011 --> 00:16:34,100
And I just said that I believe that gays
are humans.

363
00:16:34,101 --> 00:16:35,100
Even in Iraq,
like I,

364
00:16:35,101 --> 00:16:35,934
I think they are humans.
They breathe and they have the same DNA 

365
00:16:37,970 --> 00:16:40,700
for human beings are really out there 
stuff.

366
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:43,193
So,
so like I don't really think of myself 

367
00:16:44,931 --> 00:16:48,230
as a radical person.
Like I think that I'm advocating as.

368
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:51,740
But the moment you just shifted to a 
different culture,

369
00:16:51,770 --> 00:16:55,580
quote unquote,
because what I found very difficult here

370
00:16:55,581 --> 00:16:58,270
is that because we are minorities coming
from,

371
00:16:58,271 --> 00:16:59,710
um,
the majority dominate here,

372
00:16:59,740 --> 00:17:03,440
so I'm a minority all the time.
But when it comes to color of my skin,

373
00:17:03,441 --> 00:17:05,600
I'm the majority.
So here in America,

374
00:17:05,601 --> 00:17:09,590
there is this concept of the authentic 
voice when it comes to minorities,

375
00:17:09,650 --> 00:17:13,520
is that there are these stereotypes,
whether it's from the right on the left,

376
00:17:13,820 --> 00:17:16,780
like if you are from this specific race,
these,

377
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:19,910
the issues that you should care about 
the most in this specific order.

378
00:17:20,630 --> 00:17:23,220
If you are a Mexican,
you should care about immigration and,

379
00:17:23,221 --> 00:17:25,070
and so on.
And if you,

380
00:17:25,370 --> 00:17:28,790
if you are Arab,
they expect this image about,

381
00:17:29,150 --> 00:17:29,870
okay,
he's an,

382
00:17:29,870 --> 00:17:32,570
he's a young man,
so he must hate the west.

383
00:17:33,080 --> 00:17:37,700
He must be very angry against the United
States about what Bush did to Iraq.

384
00:17:37,910 --> 00:17:41,540
And they must hate capitalism and he 
must all this stuff.

385
00:17:41,690 --> 00:17:42,523
So if you don't fit into that narrative,
you're immediately going to be attacked 

386
00:17:46,610 --> 00:17:47,443
as some sort of like uncle Tom or which 
is itself racist without them noticing 

387
00:17:52,201 --> 00:17:52,681
it.
Right?

388
00:17:52,681 --> 00:17:53,514
That's what I keep saying.
They're actually using real racism 

389
00:17:56,221 --> 00:17:58,770
because they're not judging you by 
what's in your mind.

390
00:17:58,771 --> 00:18:02,580
They're judging you by what they think 
of King is like rolling as a grave right

391
00:18:02,581 --> 00:18:04,810
now because it's like the.
So,

392
00:18:04,850 --> 00:18:05,683
so that's actually one of the most 
difficult things I found over here is 

393
00:18:07,831 --> 00:18:10,650
that how come you don't subscribe to my 
order date?

394
00:18:10,740 --> 00:18:11,573
My notions of who you should be.
Like I'm like I'm individually as you 

395
00:18:15,001 --> 00:18:15,801
are and,
and,

396
00:18:15,801 --> 00:18:20,130
and now like we can see it in the US 
elections in which I've seen many people

397
00:18:20,190 --> 00:18:24,210
on both sides I would say especially I 
would say on the far left who are like,

398
00:18:24,211 --> 00:18:26,580
how can you as a,
as a black,

399
00:18:26,581 --> 00:18:28,470
not support Bernie or something like 
that.

400
00:18:28,670 --> 00:18:30,600
While black people have,
they have,

401
00:18:30,750 --> 00:18:31,583
they have agency and they may rush 
rationally think of supporting one 

402
00:18:34,951 --> 00:18:37,200
person over the other.
Like you can disagree with them,

403
00:18:37,201 --> 00:18:38,700
but that's completely fine.
But to say like,

404
00:18:38,820 --> 00:18:41,790
why is he as a black person,
you don't say that about a white person,

405
00:18:41,791 --> 00:18:42,624
they'll say like maybe support trump,
but like coming again from white people 

406
00:18:46,771 --> 00:18:47,604
on the left see a critical race theory 
from like White Guilt University of 

407
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:52,793
California and they are suddenly now 
experts of race relations and what the 

408
00:18:56,761 --> 00:18:58,640
dynamics of the Middle East are.
Right?

409
00:18:58,680 --> 00:19:02,520
And they project themselves as being the
intellectuals.

410
00:19:02,580 --> 00:19:03,413
So that's really interesting.
And because we talked so much about the 

411
00:19:06,570 --> 00:19:09,150
Middle East and we talk about extremism 
and Islam and whatever,

412
00:19:09,300 --> 00:19:12,360
I see a very specific reason why you get
something like that.

413
00:19:12,540 --> 00:19:14,550
I'm curious,
having left Singapore,

414
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:15,840
having,
you know,

415
00:19:15,930 --> 00:19:18,510
believing in secular values and atheism 
and all that,

416
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:22,350
do you find some of that,
that soft bigotry of low expectations

417
00:19:22,820 --> 00:19:24,330
that we talk about?
No,

418
00:19:24,390 --> 00:19:25,223
I don't.
In fact I'm probably a beneficiary of 

419
00:19:27,150 --> 00:19:29,430
have high expectations,
right?

420
00:19:30,810 --> 00:19:32,130
I mean,
so anyway,

421
00:19:32,220 --> 00:19:34,960
that joke that Chris Rock made at the 
Oscars with the little kids.

422
00:19:35,100 --> 00:19:37,350
Yeah,
with the little accountants and,

423
00:19:37,351 --> 00:19:38,970
and you know,
for some reason the,

424
00:19:38,971 --> 00:19:39,804
the,
the Asian community was really up in 

425
00:19:40,831 --> 00:19:41,664
arms about that stereotype.
Even though it's a positive three 

426
00:19:44,140 --> 00:19:45,270
positive stereotypes.
So w,

427
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:47,140
what did you feel when you heard that?
That's good.

428
00:19:47,300 --> 00:19:48,133
Okay.
So I did get into some online fights 

429
00:19:50,161 --> 00:19:55,161
about this because again,
his face all says because of your race,

430
00:19:55,410 --> 00:19:57,990
you know,
like seemingly Asian person,

431
00:19:58,740 --> 00:20:01,260
you should be finding this thing 
offensive.

432
00:20:02,310 --> 00:20:04,440
You shouldn't laugh at it.
You should,

433
00:20:04,850 --> 00:20:08,070
you know,
a sale and rally against an end sort of,

434
00:20:08,790 --> 00:20:11,370
um,
deny as stereotypes.

435
00:20:12,060 --> 00:20:14,400
Forgetting that this is in the context 
of humor.

436
00:20:14,940 --> 00:20:16,080
Um,
and,

437
00:20:16,090 --> 00:20:16,923
and the same thing with what Sarah,
Sacha Baron Cohen said about the little 

438
00:20:20,221 --> 00:20:20,910
minions,
like,

439
00:20:20,910 --> 00:20:23,280
that really blew,
like even Jeremy Lin,

440
00:20:23,310 --> 00:20:28,310
the basketballs got into that and I 
think it's just,

441
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:29,331
you know,
I,

442
00:20:29,331 --> 00:20:31,440
I was asking people rhetorically like 
what,

443
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:32,333
what happens to comedy if,
if you just take all stereotypes out of 

444
00:20:35,641 --> 00:20:37,740
it,
you have to be angry at South Park.

445
00:20:37,740 --> 00:20:40,040
You have to be angry at snl.
Everybody.

446
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:41,480
I mean,
this whole season,

447
00:20:41,481 --> 00:20:42,950
did you guys watch South Park this 
season?

448
00:20:43,290 --> 00:20:44,270
I mean,
this whole season,

449
00:20:44,271 --> 00:20:46,100
I think it might've been the best season
ever.

450
00:20:46,990 --> 00:20:47,823
Literally

451
00:20:48,340 --> 00:20:50,720
the entire season was dedicated.
Watch it.

452
00:20:51,300 --> 00:20:51,851
Well,
there you go.

453
00:20:51,851 --> 00:20:55,690
So the whole season was dedicated to 
fighting these exact ideas.

454
00:20:55,750 --> 00:20:56,070
Right,

455
00:20:56,070 --> 00:20:56,940
exactly.
And,

456
00:20:56,941 --> 00:20:59,250
and the thing about taking a fence is,
you know,

457
00:20:59,251 --> 00:21:03,150
I always ask people like,
who creates the offense,

458
00:21:03,210 --> 00:21:04,043
the offense,
the person who offended by the person 

459
00:21:06,961 --> 00:21:07,794
who feels the offense,
who is the one that actually created it 

460
00:21:10,830 --> 00:21:12,420
because it doesn't happen in a vacuum.

461
00:21:12,520 --> 00:21:13,353
Right?
So there's a particularly interesting 

462
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:18,360
notion with what you're saying because 
the stereotypes.

463
00:21:18,361 --> 00:21:21,070
So when Chris rock brought out the 
three,

464
00:21:21,071 --> 00:21:22,360
or was it three?
Yeah,

465
00:21:22,490 --> 00:21:23,323
three.
One of them was actually had a Jewish 

466
00:21:24,011 --> 00:21:24,844
name,
so.

467
00:21:24,850 --> 00:21:26,620
Right.
So the Jewish people weren't angry,

468
00:21:27,410 --> 00:21:30,250
so just for people that didn't see it.
So they brought out three Asian kids.

469
00:21:30,251 --> 00:21:31,084
One of them had a Jewish name and they 
were supposed to all be like accountant 

470
00:21:33,780 --> 00:21:34,613
from price waterhouse.
So they're all supposed to be really 

471
00:21:36,611 --> 00:21:37,600
bright accounts,
blah blah.

472
00:21:37,790 --> 00:21:40,920
But so the stereotype that they're using
is a positive stereotype.

473
00:21:40,950 --> 00:21:42,340
The implication is,
oh,

474
00:21:42,341 --> 00:21:43,174
these are educated kids that are going 
to go on and be good at math and they 

475
00:21:47,790 --> 00:21:49,240
excel academically.
Right.

476
00:21:49,241 --> 00:21:50,074
So when,
when people were upset with you or when 

477
00:21:51,641 --> 00:21:55,600
you said I'm okay with the humor in that
the people that were upset,

478
00:21:55,601 --> 00:21:56,770
what were,
what were they saying?

479
00:21:56,771 --> 00:21:59,110
Like did they feel that that's causing 
some sort of backlash?

480
00:21:59,130 --> 00:21:59,963
Yeah,

481
00:22:00,110 --> 00:22:00,943
so the,
they don't like the perpetuating of the 

482
00:22:03,300 --> 00:22:08,250
model minority and they think that that 
sets up a standard where now every agent

483
00:22:08,251 --> 00:22:09,084
has to live up to that.
I think they're reading too much into 

484
00:22:11,131 --> 00:22:12,030
it.
You know,

485
00:22:12,031 --> 00:22:12,864
it's,
it's,

486
00:22:12,970 --> 00:22:13,803
it's just a reflection of,
of stereotypes that have a grain of 

487
00:22:16,651 --> 00:22:20,880
truth in the case of have a leg who made
that joke about.

488
00:22:20,881 --> 00:22:23,040
He said,
well,

489
00:22:23,070 --> 00:22:23,640
you know,
this,

490
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:25,920
this Oscar's is all about diversity,
but what about them?

491
00:22:25,921 --> 00:22:27,360
Little yellow guys,
you know,

492
00:22:27,361 --> 00:22:28,620
who,
who have the little dogs?

493
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:31,490
And then he paused.
Everybody laughed,

494
00:22:31,630 --> 00:22:33,930
right?
So everybody assumed that he was talking

495
00:22:33,931 --> 00:22:36,240
about Asians and then he said,
oh,

496
00:22:36,241 --> 00:22:37,074
you know the minions.
So the job was actually on you because 

497
00:22:39,001 --> 00:22:40,800
you are the ones who did the stereotype 
thing.

498
00:22:41,260 --> 00:22:42,840
And,
and I don't think people,

499
00:22:42,870 --> 00:22:44,100
they just reacted to that.
They will like,

500
00:22:44,130 --> 00:22:45,010
oh,
leg saying,

501
00:22:45,011 --> 00:22:47,880
you know that Asians have small,
small dogs,

502
00:22:47,940 --> 00:22:48,773
and I was just like,
well actually this is the anatomy of 

503
00:22:50,971 --> 00:22:54,570
humor and if you don't know Ali g as a 
character and,

504
00:22:54,571 --> 00:22:56,490
and,
and how he's playing off his humor,

505
00:22:56,491 --> 00:22:57,610
he's actually saying you're the one who

506
00:22:57,680 --> 00:22:59,300
stereotyping.
So just to be clear,

507
00:22:59,301 --> 00:23:00,134
he did something really clever there 
because he took you one way or made you 

508
00:23:02,451 --> 00:23:04,520
laugh and then immediately takes you the
other place.

509
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:05,990
So you're right,
it's on you,

510
00:23:06,210 --> 00:23:07,043
on you.
You're the one who stereotyped left and 

511
00:23:08,371 --> 00:23:10,820
you thought that he meant Asian people.
So

512
00:23:10,890 --> 00:23:15,210
I think all of this is directly linked 
to the authoritarianism stuff,

513
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:16,073
right?
So you came from an authoritarian 

514
00:23:18,031 --> 00:23:20,460
government.
You were not allowed to say,

515
00:23:20,461 --> 00:23:21,011
you know,
I'm a,

516
00:23:21,011 --> 00:23:22,840
I'm a free thinker in a secularist.
You've,

517
00:23:22,980 --> 00:23:24,540
you've laid out why you can't,
you know,

518
00:23:24,541 --> 00:23:25,374
lived under an authoritarian rule and 
now we see this happening here and I'm 

519
00:23:29,080 --> 00:23:29,913
firmly,
I firmly believe that we are in like 

520
00:23:32,280 --> 00:23:36,390
some really murky waters in America 
right now and in the West in general.

521
00:23:36,450 --> 00:23:39,090
So what do we do to fight this?
Well,

522
00:23:39,170 --> 00:23:42,420
I mean there a,
I think I do my step because now it is,

523
00:23:42,700 --> 00:23:46,040
is coming to our lines here and it's 
happening over there

524
00:23:46,130 --> 00:23:46,963
and um,
when it comes to what's happening over 

525
00:23:49,431 --> 00:23:49,971
there,
I mean,

526
00:23:49,971 --> 00:23:54,971
I think the best solution for is to 
support the values that I think to be on

527
00:23:55,941 --> 00:23:56,774
the right side of history on this battle
between authoritarianism and I would 

528
00:24:01,251 --> 00:24:05,550
include a theocratic fascism in the end,
the umbrella and uh,

529
00:24:06,140 --> 00:24:10,130
and the values of John Stuart Mill and 
Jefferson and,

530
00:24:10,131 --> 00:24:11,260
uh,
the values of,

531
00:24:11,530 --> 00:24:13,600
of the free man.
And you think,

532
00:24:13,750 --> 00:24:16,060
do you guys think that those are values 
are the left anywhere?

533
00:24:16,061 --> 00:24:18,540
When you think of John Stuart Mill or 
classic liberalism?

534
00:24:18,550 --> 00:24:20,950
It seems to me that that's not even a 
value.

535
00:24:20,951 --> 00:24:21,784
That really.

536
00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:22,753
Yeah,
I mean the last has shifted and the 

537
00:24:24,901 --> 00:24:27,740
right has shifted.
Like now we live in a moment.

538
00:24:27,820 --> 00:24:28,653
You can look at the elections,
then you can see for yourself like we 

539
00:24:30,721 --> 00:24:33,510
live in a very polarized.
I mean there's,

540
00:24:33,700 --> 00:24:38,700
there's no discussion about everything.
Like you can start by whether it's Islam

541
00:24:38,881 --> 00:24:41,550
or abortion or gun control or a glass of
water.

542
00:24:42,190 --> 00:24:45,000
And one of the things like,
well the things that I like because like

543
00:24:45,010 --> 00:24:45,843
it's like a,
it's a dogma and like you can actually 

544
00:24:47,251 --> 00:24:48,084
know someone,
someone position from abortion about 

545
00:24:50,580 --> 00:24:52,670
abortion and gun control,
but ask them questions,

546
00:24:52,700 --> 00:24:53,533
right?
Or don't like what do you think about 

547
00:24:54,250 --> 00:24:55,083
abortion?
And then you can actually know that a 

548
00:24:56,041 --> 00:24:56,874
position on gun control,
because it's like now is like this 

549
00:24:59,281 --> 00:25:03,190
polarization of like dogmatism of the 10
commandments of the left,

550
00:25:03,250 --> 00:25:07,020
the 10 commandments of the riots.
And so I think that both sides have kind

551
00:25:07,021 --> 00:25:09,780
of lost principles.
I've even the quote unquote the right.

552
00:25:09,781 --> 00:25:12,810
I mean they are supposedly about the 
free market,

553
00:25:12,811 --> 00:25:16,030
but they want to police people's,
a vagina and a job.

554
00:25:16,210 --> 00:25:19,360
They are not as,
they're not as a free,

555
00:25:19,490 --> 00:25:21,090
uh,
they as they claim to be.

556
00:25:21,091 --> 00:25:24,690
I mean they want to police marriage and 
marriage equality.

557
00:25:24,691 --> 00:25:25,524
They want to police a woman's 
reproductive rights and the stuff and 

558
00:25:28,231 --> 00:25:30,140
the left one.
Supposedly they'll.

559
00:25:30,270 --> 00:25:33,070
The guys are free speech one to how the 
police.

560
00:25:33,730 --> 00:25:36,340
The sad part here,
if we're jumping onto the political side

561
00:25:36,341 --> 00:25:37,174
of this,
that the one guy who wanted smaller 

562
00:25:38,861 --> 00:25:39,694
government,
the one guy who wanted rand Paul who 

563
00:25:41,981 --> 00:25:42,814
wanted,
who's as close to a libertarian that 

564
00:25:44,831 --> 00:25:48,280
we're going to get into the mainstream 
parties and I had Gary Johnson on here a

565
00:25:48,280 --> 00:25:49,870
couple weeks ago who's running under the
libertarian ticket.

566
00:25:50,050 --> 00:25:51,140
Unfortunately.
Good luck.

567
00:25:51,490 --> 00:25:53,230
Good luck for that.
Unfortunately,

568
00:25:53,231 --> 00:25:56,980
we still don't have a legitimate,
truly legitimate third party yet,

569
00:25:56,981 --> 00:25:59,230
but I think that after the craziness of 
this year,

570
00:25:59,231 --> 00:26:01,750
I actually think it's possible for 20 
slash 20,

571
00:26:01,930 --> 00:26:04,570
but is that the real fault?
So we focus on the left,

572
00:26:04,571 --> 00:26:06,410
but there was a moment that they're 
right.

573
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:07,780
Could have said,
all right,

574
00:26:07,781 --> 00:26:08,614
maybe this is the guy that we should 
listen to because he's got some of our 

575
00:26:10,601 --> 00:26:14,790
principals and then they kicked him out 
after one bad caucus.

576
00:26:14,860 --> 00:26:18,430
I think it was actually Islamic 
extremism.

577
00:26:18,431 --> 00:26:19,264
What was going on in the Middle East 
that really did rand Paul's campaign in 

578
00:26:21,970 --> 00:26:23,770
the rise of Isis and,
and you know,

579
00:26:23,771 --> 00:26:26,080
the,
the havoc that was racking the refugees.

580
00:26:26,620 --> 00:26:27,453
It's sort of,
it's sort of implicated that the United 

581
00:26:29,950 --> 00:26:33,130
States couldn't be isolationists and the
libertarian position is to just,

582
00:26:33,290 --> 00:26:34,270
you know,
hold back.

583
00:26:34,420 --> 00:26:38,880
So I think that's what kind of killed.
I'm rand Paul's Rand Paul said.

584
00:26:39,350 --> 00:26:40,183
Yeah.
It was interesting because when I had 

585
00:26:40,821 --> 00:26:41,654
Gary Johnson on,
I didn't know what his policy was on 

586
00:26:43,740 --> 00:26:44,010
because

587
00:26:44,010 --> 00:26:44,843
of the libertarian really you can,
you don't have to be so like just like 

588
00:26:48,031 --> 00:26:48,864
this and so ron everything.
So when I asked him about some Middle 

589
00:26:51,330 --> 00:26:52,950
East stuff and some foreign policy 
stuff,

590
00:26:53,190 --> 00:26:57,090
he actually did feel that there is still
a role for the United States.

591
00:26:57,480 --> 00:27:01,600
Didn't really lay out exactly what it 
was really interesting.

592
00:27:01,610 --> 00:27:05,060
I mean with the Libertarian Party as 
well,

593
00:27:05,210 --> 00:27:06,043
as I mentioned,
there's this concept of isolationism 

594
00:27:08,900 --> 00:27:09,733
which are very strong in the.
But I thing is like if you're not 

595
00:27:12,601 --> 00:27:14,700
interested in the Middle East and Middle
East is interested in us,

596
00:27:15,220 --> 00:27:16,930
but what happens in the Middle East 
doesn't.

597
00:27:17,020 --> 00:27:17,853
It's not Las Vegas.
Like what happens in Iraq doesn't stay 

598
00:27:19,471 --> 00:27:20,304
in,
even though we have the same mother 

599
00:27:22,590 --> 00:27:24,950
between Vegas and Iraq,
but one thing that does,

600
00:27:25,020 --> 00:27:26,640
that's,
that doesn't stay over there.

601
00:27:27,060 --> 00:27:27,893
And uh,
and that's one thing is Islamic 

602
00:27:29,311 --> 00:27:30,144
extremism and I mean because one of the 
good things about Islam and I always 

603
00:27:34,230 --> 00:27:38,670
admitted like it is the least price 
that's religion and it is very universal

604
00:27:38,730 --> 00:27:41,070
and it always talks about universal 
values.

605
00:27:41,070 --> 00:27:44,520
I mean one of the famous quotes of 
Prophet Mohammad in which he said,

606
00:27:44,670 --> 00:27:47,810
but there's no difference between Arab 
and non Arab except by I'm like,

607
00:27:47,880 --> 00:27:49,570
I think how much faithful he is.
So,

608
00:27:49,940 --> 00:27:51,190
so that,
so the,

609
00:27:51,330 --> 00:27:52,163
well that's universal.
Except he was saying you have to 

610
00:27:53,821 --> 00:27:55,210
convert.
Yes.

611
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:59,550
Religion transcend borders is that you 
can be a,

612
00:27:59,580 --> 00:28:02,250
like the values of Islam can't transcend
borders.

613
00:28:02,251 --> 00:28:05,540
Not like a tribal religion.
Let's say like Judaism is with,

614
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:06,433
with Islam.
So what effects what's happening in the 

615
00:28:09,450 --> 00:28:10,283
Middle East can effect like many people 
who are recruiters for Isis are in the 

616
00:28:13,970 --> 00:28:14,803
Middle East,
but the recruiting on the Internet for 

617
00:28:15,601 --> 00:28:16,434
people living in the West.
But I'm failing to see how you see this 

618
00:28:18,331 --> 00:28:21,330
as a positive thing because it isn't 
that showing why it's spreading.

619
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:22,850
No,
I mean a.

620
00:28:23,150 --> 00:28:26,100
it's a double edged sword is that it's a
good thing that is not racist,

621
00:28:26,101 --> 00:28:28,390
but it's a bad thing that is universal,
right?

622
00:28:30,110 --> 00:28:34,640
To do that as a little more bad.
But back to the isolation.

623
00:28:35,210 --> 00:28:39,150
The isolation is believed that if we can
just secure the borders,

624
00:28:39,151 --> 00:28:42,330
if you can ban everybody from entering 
or whatever.

625
00:28:42,331 --> 00:28:43,164
Even the Libertarians are clinical 
educator because they believe in open 

626
00:28:45,211 --> 00:28:48,180
borders as the same time reducing the 
welfare state.

627
00:28:48,181 --> 00:28:50,040
So in that way we can accept more 
immigrants.

628
00:28:50,250 --> 00:28:52,290
So yeah.
How are we going to deal with that?

629
00:28:52,340 --> 00:28:53,173
Like with Islamic extremism rising gap 
with the refugees coming in with people 

630
00:28:57,121 --> 00:28:57,954
from the West getting recruited to join 
terrorist groups that may actually make 

631
00:29:00,691 --> 00:29:04,380
attacks here in the west,
like Paris attacks and Charlie Hebdo and

632
00:29:04,560 --> 00:29:07,530
even like now some like my friend just 
recently came from Germany.

633
00:29:07,531 --> 00:29:10,890
She's a woman from Afghanistan and she 
said like in,

634
00:29:11,140 --> 00:29:16,140
in some hotels telling data are telling 
women not to go out at night out of fear

635
00:29:16,710 --> 00:29:17,543
of being harassed by the newcomers and 
which then ultimately just strengthens 

636
00:29:22,291 --> 00:29:23,070
the far right.

637
00:29:23,070 --> 00:29:24,450
Exactly.
Tweeted this morning,

638
00:29:24,451 --> 00:29:25,284
I saw,
I saw an article in Germany that at one 

639
00:29:26,851 --> 00:29:29,880
of the public pools were allowed lot.
The migrants are going to.

640
00:29:30,120 --> 00:29:30,953
That there were,
there were a lot of men that were 

641
00:29:32,191 --> 00:29:34,860
attacking women and children,
so now they're.

642
00:29:34,920 --> 00:29:38,130
Their resolution is that they're going 
to segregate by sex,

643
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:41,070
so you know,
weird way now the government came in and

644
00:29:41,290 --> 00:29:44,440
the most sort of the thing that religion
would want the most.

645
00:29:44,441 --> 00:29:46,390
Now we're going to separate men and 
women and guess what?

646
00:29:46,510 --> 00:29:47,343
When people aren't having sex as Bill 
Maher would say that sort of fertile 

647
00:29:50,171 --> 00:29:55,171
ground for extremists or extremism.
I think the horseshoe theory is like one

648
00:29:55,841 --> 00:29:57,950
of the best way to play and sex is like 
not.

649
00:29:58,220 --> 00:29:59,053
Not also.
They also theater is like how much they 

650
00:29:59,981 --> 00:30:04,450
feed into each other is that the more 
people say that there is no problem with

651
00:30:04,451 --> 00:30:06,790
Islam,
the more people on the far right will be

652
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:07,833
getting more powerful because whenever,
because there's a correlation between 

653
00:30:10,071 --> 00:30:12,910
the rise of terrorist attacks and the 
rise of far right groups,

654
00:30:12,911 --> 00:30:13,744
another sunrise grows,
but the need for them to get mobilized 

655
00:30:16,300 --> 00:30:17,133
and like people like trump or people 
like the edl and defense league or a 

656
00:30:21,190 --> 00:30:24,580
material upon the fronds that when the 
Paris attacks happened,

657
00:30:24,581 --> 00:30:26,350
that moment is like,
let's get mobilized.

658
00:30:26,350 --> 00:30:27,161
Let's,
let's,

659
00:30:27,161 --> 00:30:29,560
uh,
we're losing our way of life and,

660
00:30:29,561 --> 00:30:30,394
and stuff.
So I mean this is one of the biggest 

661
00:30:32,921 --> 00:30:33,754
issues,
and we were talking about it a few days 

662
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:36,700
ago,
is that with the rise of the far right,

663
00:30:36,701 --> 00:30:39,370
when they start quote unquote killing 
Muslims,

664
00:30:39,371 --> 00:30:41,850
I'd want attack Muslims and all of that.
They're not all that.

665
00:30:42,040 --> 00:30:44,290
They're attacking people who look Muslim
as well there.

666
00:30:44,500 --> 00:30:44,971
I mean,
I,

667
00:30:44,971 --> 00:30:48,640
I don't have no one's Hashtag on my face
saying I'm a Muslim,

668
00:30:48,780 --> 00:30:51,160
but even I'm not going to advocate for 
attacking Muslims either.

669
00:30:51,161 --> 00:30:52,300
I mean,
my parents are Muslims,

670
00:30:52,301 --> 00:30:54,520
but I grew up with Muslims,
I love many of them,

671
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:55,473
but I don't want.
So what's happening is that when people 

672
00:30:57,161 --> 00:30:57,994
do not acknowledge the problem there is 
these guys are going to be and they're 

673
00:31:00,370 --> 00:31:01,203
going to be attacking six and they're 
going to be attacking anybody who looks 

674
00:31:03,490 --> 00:31:03,920
Brown.

675
00:31:03,920 --> 00:31:04,753
Right?
So that's the problem is that there 

676
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:08,110
absolutely are true racist,
right?

677
00:31:08,111 --> 00:31:09,850
There absolutely are true bigots.
And by the way,

678
00:31:09,851 --> 00:31:11,740
that's why I had Tommy Robinson on my 
show.

679
00:31:11,741 --> 00:31:12,574
I don't agree with everything he says 
and I don't fully understand everything 

680
00:31:15,551 --> 00:31:17,500
about what's going on in,
in the UK and Europe,

681
00:31:17,501 --> 00:31:19,540
but I'm trying to learn and I know he 
had tried to,

682
00:31:19,720 --> 00:31:20,553
at least from what I understand,
separated himself from some of the more 

683
00:31:22,481 --> 00:31:24,940
racist elements of the EDL and some of 
those organizations.

684
00:31:24,941 --> 00:31:26,890
So I thought it was worthy of a 
conversation.

685
00:31:26,891 --> 00:31:28,960
But I think this is a good segue to 
something you said earlier.

686
00:31:29,170 --> 00:31:32,350
So a certain in Singapore,
a certain amount of authoritarianism.

687
00:31:32,351 --> 00:31:37,351
It sounds like it made people coexist 
and is that sort of on the surface?

688
00:31:37,421 --> 00:31:39,400
So is that sort of a,
it's a very,

689
00:31:39,401 --> 00:31:41,530
like you got to thread that needle 
really carefully,

690
00:31:41,531 --> 00:31:42,350
right?
Yeah.

691
00:31:42,350 --> 00:31:43,560
Um,
you know,

692
00:31:43,561 --> 00:31:44,340
it,
it,

693
00:31:44,340 --> 00:31:45,630
it ultimately,
it's,

694
00:31:45,631 --> 00:31:46,464
it's a political philosophy question.
And also what is the purpose of 

695
00:31:49,201 --> 00:31:50,160
government,
right?

696
00:31:50,500 --> 00:31:51,333
Is it,
is it to maintain the most stable 

697
00:31:53,071 --> 00:31:55,860
society?
Is it to raise the standard of living of

698
00:31:55,861 --> 00:31:56,694
most people?
And do the ends ultimately justify the 

699
00:31:59,521 --> 00:32:02,640
means because to get there,
you know,

700
00:32:02,710 --> 00:32:04,200
their,
for example,

701
00:32:04,201 --> 00:32:05,034
like we in 2007 we've had,
have you make racist comments on your 

702
00:32:08,941 --> 00:32:10,770
blog,
you can be jailed.

703
00:32:11,080 --> 00:32:13,580
Um,
so you're not free to,

704
00:32:13,610 --> 00:32:15,630
to,
to make these comments and how,

705
00:32:15,690 --> 00:32:17,430
how else does that manifest?
Right?

706
00:32:17,670 --> 00:32:18,503
So in the United States,
anybody can say any racist thing they 

707
00:32:20,611 --> 00:32:21,444
want,
um,

708
00:32:21,500 --> 00:32:24,400
you'll never be thrown into jail for 
that anyway.

709
00:32:24,410 --> 00:32:25,750
You might be booted off twitter,
but also,

710
00:32:26,250 --> 00:32:28,460
I mean the word racist,
I mean,

711
00:32:28,620 --> 00:32:31,920
it could be perceived as racist,
can get you in jail.

712
00:32:32,170 --> 00:32:33,003
There's a subtly,
what we probably all know what racism 

713
00:32:35,110 --> 00:32:35,943
is.
It could be something that they say 

714
00:32:37,791 --> 00:32:38,624
like,
oh,

715
00:32:39,010 --> 00:32:40,340
because people could be something that,

716
00:32:41,320 --> 00:32:42,910
no,
absolutely it's a good racism for me,

717
00:32:42,911 --> 00:32:43,744
but the sedition and blasphemy laws 
essentially protect also the criticism 

718
00:32:48,700 --> 00:32:49,533
of religion,
religious institutions from often very 

719
00:32:53,021 --> 00:32:54,280
necessary criticism,
right?

720
00:32:54,330 --> 00:32:57,220
It's like I can't even go there.
You can't critique and,

721
00:32:57,280 --> 00:32:58,113
and it,
it creates that climate where where 

722
00:32:59,681 --> 00:33:00,514
people just don't question because 
they're afraid and they don't talk 

723
00:33:03,371 --> 00:33:03,941
about.
They just,

724
00:33:03,941 --> 00:33:07,570
they're a decent safe spaces right now.
Let's not go talking about.

725
00:33:07,930 --> 00:33:10,720
I'm talking about religion.
We can't,

726
00:33:10,721 --> 00:33:13,930
we can discuss racism very well in 
Singapore.

727
00:33:14,140 --> 00:33:16,180
It's a very sensitive.
Let's not talk about it.

728
00:33:16,570 --> 00:33:17,403
So people tread on eggshells and,
and I mean it's funny because I feel 

729
00:33:20,711 --> 00:33:24,460
like I sort of escaped that.
That scenario,

730
00:33:24,461 --> 00:33:25,294
like the right sort of top down,
government instituted curtailing of the 

731
00:33:29,111 --> 00:33:33,040
freedom of speech come to theu ,
s and slowly on campuses.

732
00:33:33,041 --> 00:33:33,874
What starts happening is now the left 
asking for the same thing the students 

733
00:33:36,341 --> 00:33:37,174
are asking for safe spaces.
What you said about the segregation in 

734
00:33:39,371 --> 00:33:40,204
Germany,
right?

735
00:33:40,660 --> 00:33:41,493
Essentially that's what religion is 
doing is creating a safe space between 

736
00:33:44,021 --> 00:33:44,854
men and women.
Yeah.

737
00:33:45,040 --> 00:33:48,610
So like what phase also at the horseshoe
theory does come together,

738
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:49,793
you know,
let the left and the right extreme left 

739
00:33:51,341 --> 00:33:54,340
the effectively are kind of achieving 
the same result.

740
00:33:54,840 --> 00:33:59,100
But also like worth mentioning about 
like Singapore even like I can't believe

741
00:33:59,101 --> 00:33:59,934
I'm actually from Asia.
I'm actually on the same continent and 

742
00:34:03,290 --> 00:34:08,290
Asia and I'll try to keep that in mind.
I'm judging you for now is that within a

743
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:13,880
eastern cultures there is a lot of sense
of collectivism and the and the concepts

744
00:34:14,551 --> 00:34:19,551
of tribalism that makes it easier for 
leaders to tell them like the philosophy

745
00:34:19,951 --> 00:34:24,870
of Buddhism and Confucianism that 
there's others respect to the leader and

746
00:34:24,871 --> 00:34:25,850
like,
so like I said,

747
00:34:25,851 --> 00:34:28,490
it's generally like a culture of self in
China is like a.

748
00:34:29,020 --> 00:34:29,853
so,
so what's happening is that is open to 

749
00:34:30,880 --> 00:34:31,713
people like when they talk about change 
in the Middle East and things of that 

750
00:34:33,511 --> 00:34:35,070
sort and Jolene,
eastern culture,

751
00:34:35,340 --> 00:34:39,450
you will see that you don't need to 
create a critical mass because you don't

752
00:34:39,451 --> 00:34:41,820
need to check most of individuals 
because it's a collective culture.

753
00:34:41,820 --> 00:34:42,653
If you change the leader and the leader 
telling people to look at Iraq for 

754
00:34:45,931 --> 00:34:46,764
example,
within,

755
00:34:46,830 --> 00:34:49,260
if you look at the history of rock the 
last 50 years,

756
00:34:49,261 --> 00:34:54,050
you'll see 50 years ago women were free 
and some places are in Europe,

757
00:34:54,051 --> 00:34:54,884
you know,
and the moment that the leadership 

758
00:34:56,551 --> 00:34:58,860
change,
they killed some civil society activists

759
00:34:58,861 --> 00:34:59,694
and stuff.
The moment everybody start worshiping 

760
00:35:01,891 --> 00:35:02,600
and then,
and,

761
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:03,540
and,
and so on.

762
00:35:03,660 --> 00:35:05,380
So did you see,
uh,

763
00:35:05,381 --> 00:35:08,200
I'm trying to interrupt,
but did you see this meme about a,

764
00:35:08,220 --> 00:35:11,100
there was about 30 women from different 
countries,

765
00:35:11,160 --> 00:35:12,990
you saw this,
30 women are 50 women,

766
00:35:12,991 --> 00:35:16,620
may be from different countries at 
mostly Arab countries or at least Muslim

767
00:35:16,770 --> 00:35:20,010
majority countries showing what their,
what their actual dress,

768
00:35:20,011 --> 00:35:22,860
the indigenous dress that is supposed to
be in.

769
00:35:22,861 --> 00:35:23,694
It's all vibrant and they are free in 
their clothes and it says it's not 

770
00:35:26,881 --> 00:35:27,870
supposed to be this.

771
00:35:27,870 --> 00:35:28,703
And then they show with one of the 
things that like what ideology of 

772
00:35:32,610 --> 00:35:36,120
[inaudible] and our hub is in what's 
called used to call himself.

773
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:37,033
I'm not the web,
it's called himself a Muslim reformer 

774
00:35:38,700 --> 00:35:39,533
that he wanted to make all the Muslim 
world homogeneous and that's part of 

775
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:47,130
some of his success because they're 
appealing to this concept that Oh,

776
00:35:47,131 --> 00:35:50,340
we all have different than humans and a 
different cultures and stuff,

777
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:55,400
but yet all my bringing all of you under
one caliphate all under one ideology and

778
00:35:56,430 --> 00:35:58,320
all of them I need to order the same 
address and all.

779
00:35:58,321 --> 00:35:59,154
Many.
And it's appealing to some people and 

780
00:36:00,731 --> 00:36:04,650
not appealing to those who are cultured,
but that's another reason it has been to

781
00:36:04,651 --> 00:36:05,484
some extent successful because it 
appeals to the people who want to have 

782
00:36:08,641 --> 00:36:09,474
the collective mindset to want to be 
like part of one umbrella and one 

783
00:36:12,301 --> 00:36:12,960
leadership.

784
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:14,690
And that's what an Arabic is called 
Omar,

785
00:36:15,260 --> 00:36:17,060
Omar,
the Islamic Omar,

786
00:36:17,061 --> 00:36:17,894
the Arabic Omar come from,
is that this concept of one leadership 

787
00:36:20,551 --> 00:36:22,620
in one community and,
and all of that.

788
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:26,430
So the three of us sitting here,
three secular people,

789
00:36:26,760 --> 00:36:27,810
atheist,
right.

790
00:36:27,900 --> 00:36:28,733
So you grew up methodist.
I didn't even know that until we sat 

791
00:36:30,271 --> 00:36:32,130
down just now.
You grew up Muslim,

792
00:36:32,131 --> 00:36:32,964
right?
That's to some extent to where my 

793
00:36:34,261 --> 00:36:35,400
parents are liberal,
but yeah.

794
00:36:35,430 --> 00:36:38,580
But I grew up in a Muslim culture.
Certainly in a Muslim culture.

795
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:40,950
I grew up Jewish.
I still consider myself Jewish,

796
00:36:40,951 --> 00:36:42,660
but I'm not a believer in,
in a,

797
00:36:42,661 --> 00:36:45,240
in a magical.
You don't believe in a talking donkey.

798
00:36:45,241 --> 00:36:47,280
I don't believe in the talking donkey or
the fire.

799
00:36:47,281 --> 00:36:49,220
They talked to her,
all that stuff and the way,

800
00:36:49,290 --> 00:36:50,460
you know,
um,

801
00:36:50,490 --> 00:36:51,323
but it's ideas that brought us all here.
And that's why I wanted to have youtube 

802
00:36:54,300 --> 00:36:56,940
on together because I think that that's 
really interesting.

803
00:36:56,941 --> 00:37:00,830
It shows that these concepts are 
irrelevant,

804
00:37:00,831 --> 00:37:01,770
you know,
these concepts,

805
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:03,690
transcend borders and all of that stuff.

806
00:37:04,220 --> 00:37:05,053
I really like what really interested me 
about sort of joining forces with 

807
00:37:09,540 --> 00:37:10,373
Faisal,
especially right now with the shift 

808
00:37:12,191 --> 00:37:13,990
that,
that he's doing with a human rights.

809
00:37:13,991 --> 00:37:18,370
He's focusing not just on the atheist 
movement or the secular movement.

810
00:37:18,820 --> 00:37:20,260
Well,
what can we do about it?

811
00:37:20,261 --> 00:37:25,261
So he's now working in human rights and,
and the reason I'm so supportive of that

812
00:37:25,530 --> 00:37:29,110
and want to be involved in that is 
because for me,

813
00:37:29,410 --> 00:37:31,990
you know,
I grew up in a country where I think one

814
00:37:31,991 --> 00:37:32,824
of the,
the,

815
00:37:32,840 --> 00:37:35,770
the founding father of Singapore,
Mr Lee Kuan Yew,

816
00:37:35,771 --> 00:37:36,970
who,
who recently passed away,

817
00:37:37,840 --> 00:37:38,673
one of the most dangerous legacies,
he's probably one of the greatest 

818
00:37:40,451 --> 00:37:42,460
statesmen modern statesman,
you know,

819
00:37:42,550 --> 00:37:43,930
um,
ever.

820
00:37:44,230 --> 00:37:48,550
And he's built a country that went from 
third world to first world in just three

821
00:37:48,551 --> 00:37:50,350
decades.
It's a feat that,

822
00:37:50,590 --> 00:37:51,311
I mean,
it's,

823
00:37:51,311 --> 00:37:53,020
it's amazing what he's done for the 
country,

824
00:37:53,021 --> 00:37:55,690
but I'm,
on the other hand,

825
00:37:55,691 --> 00:37:56,524
he sort of legitimize this term which 
kind of bothers me is he says that it's 

826
00:38:00,341 --> 00:38:05,341
called Asian values that because Asia,
because of his history and culture,

827
00:38:06,560 --> 00:38:10,260
um,
the western ideas of,

828
00:38:10,280 --> 00:38:10,811
of,
you know,

829
00:38:10,811 --> 00:38:11,644
liberal democracy cannot apply and it 
doesn't fit well within the culture and 

830
00:38:16,391 --> 00:38:18,820
he uses confucianism as a bulwark 
against that,

831
00:38:18,821 --> 00:38:21,670
like what he was saying about 
collectivism and,

832
00:38:21,700 --> 00:38:24,340
and so it sort of pits,
you know,

833
00:38:24,430 --> 00:38:26,470
the West Western ideas and it says,
oh,

834
00:38:26,471 --> 00:38:27,610
it's invalid here.

835
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:31,270
It can work here.
And to me that is cultural relativism.

836
00:38:31,360 --> 00:38:32,011
You know,
it,

837
00:38:32,011 --> 00:38:35,470
it violates human rights.
Like it's not,

838
00:38:35,560 --> 00:38:40,560
it's not consistent with this saying he 
saying sort of be free but not that free

839
00:38:41,740 --> 00:38:45,070
because that's sort of what will 
undermine what we've built.

840
00:38:45,380 --> 00:38:48,700
Well they are re,
they legitimize their able to legitimize

841
00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:51,970
repressive policies under the guise of 
Asian values.

842
00:38:51,971 --> 00:38:54,400
It's almost like exceptionalism.
Like you know,

843
00:38:54,420 --> 00:38:55,253
we prioritize social harmony and 
prosperity over individual freedom and 

844
00:38:59,350 --> 00:39:01,040
this is our culture.
So,

845
00:39:01,041 --> 00:39:01,874
so our policies fit that.
And I think for me that was what was 

846
00:39:03,881 --> 00:39:04,714
very dangerous about that idea and you 
start seeing it being replicated in 

847
00:39:07,991 --> 00:39:09,550
Russia,
like Putin's doing that.

848
00:39:09,630 --> 00:39:10,463
Um,
I see Jinping and China and they're 

849
00:39:14,261 --> 00:39:15,094
taking the leaf out of his book now and 
creating almost like parallel 

850
00:39:18,731 --> 00:39:23,140
alternative to western democracy.
And part of that,

851
00:39:23,141 --> 00:39:23,570
again,
it

852
00:39:23,570 --> 00:39:28,220
goes to the way we see Europe having so 
many problems right now and we don't see

853
00:39:28,221 --> 00:39:29,900
those problems in Russia.
Right?

854
00:39:30,130 --> 00:39:34,310
I mean certainly the immigration stuff,
we don't see that in Russia.

855
00:39:34,311 --> 00:39:37,320
And because of that then it makes 
probably the average European,

856
00:39:37,400 --> 00:39:39,470
it makes poodle look kind of good even 
if they don't like.

857
00:39:41,610 --> 00:39:42,443
But also it's worth mentioning that 
Russia is not a country worth 

858
00:39:45,351 --> 00:39:46,184
immigrating to.
So they want somebody who's a refugee 

859
00:39:51,231 --> 00:39:52,980
himself.
He wanted to go somewhere warm,

860
00:39:53,840 --> 00:39:54,673
totally warm.
But I want to have a country that is 

861
00:39:56,241 --> 00:39:57,830
probably different than where I come 
from.

862
00:39:57,831 --> 00:39:58,664
It does.
But authoritarianism is that I'm in 

863
00:39:59,811 --> 00:40:00,644
Europe.
I mean obviously it's much better 

864
00:40:02,361 --> 00:40:06,440
economically and much better socially 
that makes less people.

865
00:40:06,441 --> 00:40:07,370
But,
but yeah,

866
00:40:07,500 --> 00:40:09,830
I mean when you have an open border 
policy that's,

867
00:40:10,010 --> 00:40:10,843
I think Germany would probably have it 
and the net not a very strong vetting 

868
00:40:15,021 --> 00:40:17,180
system you're going to have because as I
said,

869
00:40:17,181 --> 00:40:18,014
there was the rise of far right and 
Islamic terrorist attacks and if we are 

870
00:40:21,411 --> 00:40:22,244
not going to support the reformers and 
the liberals are trying to change the 

871
00:40:25,390 --> 00:40:27,540
things in the societies because I mean 
I,

872
00:40:27,541 --> 00:40:28,374
I wrote an article about the Syrian 
refugee crisis and one of the main 

873
00:40:30,891 --> 00:40:34,340
issues is that there is no solution to 
Syrian refugees going to keep coming.

874
00:40:34,460 --> 00:40:35,293
Yeah.
So if you're not going to find the 

875
00:40:36,141 --> 00:40:38,030
solution over there,
then it's,

876
00:40:38,190 --> 00:40:40,310
this issue is going to continue all the 
time.

877
00:40:40,311 --> 00:40:41,144
So not always serious and as obviously 
it's Libya has also having a problem at 

878
00:40:44,921 --> 00:40:48,750
the opiate and all the other countries 
in the region and obviously Iraq since a

879
00:40:48,970 --> 00:40:50,560
long time.
But the,

880
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:52,400
we're not going to find solutions over 
there.

881
00:40:52,401 --> 00:40:56,450
So other than just like a focus on 
domestic issues.

882
00:40:56,451 --> 00:40:57,284
That's where like libertarianism fails 
because it's always deals with the 

883
00:40:59,241 --> 00:41:00,074
refugees are coming in.
But how can we reduce the amount of 

884
00:41:02,181 --> 00:41:03,014
refugees that are coming in for that 
region that's by not subtly motor 

885
00:41:06,951 --> 00:41:07,784
intervention,
but at least being on the right side of 

886
00:41:09,561 --> 00:41:10,394
history and being with the people who 
support the values that reduce the 

887
00:41:13,041 --> 00:41:13,910
amount of revenue.
Right.

888
00:41:13,911 --> 00:41:17,510
I suspect that most libertarians would 
say somebody like Rand Paul would say,

889
00:41:17,511 --> 00:41:19,310
well,
I wasn't for the Iraq war,

890
00:41:20,300 --> 00:41:21,800
so I didn't add to the chaos.

891
00:41:21,890 --> 00:41:22,723
Right.
It's irrelevant now because here we are 

892
00:41:24,261 --> 00:41:26,270
now.
But that is not enough.

893
00:41:26,300 --> 00:41:27,980
I mean,
this concept of like,

894
00:41:28,250 --> 00:41:29,083
well,
but I'm not a racist is not enough to 

895
00:41:31,030 --> 00:41:33,070
two different things.
Yeah.

896
00:41:33,310 --> 00:41:33,720
And,
and,

897
00:41:33,720 --> 00:41:35,990
and I mean people talk about the numbers
and stuff.

898
00:41:35,991 --> 00:41:38,540
I met Saddam Hussein killed hundreds of 
thousands of people.

899
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:41,540
If they did not intervene,
there will also be hundreds of thousands

900
00:41:41,541 --> 00:41:42,374
of people killed.
So,

901
00:41:42,520 --> 00:41:43,650
so just because saying,
oh,

902
00:41:43,940 --> 00:41:46,460
I'm against the war,
doesn't somebody make him a good person?

903
00:41:46,640 --> 00:41:47,720
You know what I mean?
I mean,

904
00:41:47,750 --> 00:41:50,420
I'm talking about practical solutions 
for.

905
00:41:50,421 --> 00:41:51,254
I mean,
the war happened and we have to deal 

906
00:41:52,491 --> 00:41:52,720
with it.

907
00:41:52,720 --> 00:41:54,550
Yeah.
So that's a great segway to sort of what

908
00:41:54,551 --> 00:41:55,384
you guys do because you know,
what you do with movements and what you 

909
00:41:57,911 --> 00:42:01,900
guys are doing together.
We have to empower these voices.

910
00:42:02,080 --> 00:42:06,100
Um,
so just a few weeks ago I had someone on

911
00:42:06,101 --> 00:42:08,980
the show from Iraq or I,
well,

912
00:42:08,981 --> 00:42:10,570
I guess we can give her first name,
at least for now.

913
00:42:10,571 --> 00:42:13,690
So we had moved on the show and she's a 
secularist and atheist.

914
00:42:13,691 --> 00:42:15,670
All the things that we all stand up for 
her,

915
00:42:15,680 --> 00:42:18,960
she's a minority within a minority.
Um,

916
00:42:19,340 --> 00:42:20,173
I,
we can't get into the major details of 

917
00:42:21,491 --> 00:42:22,324
what's going on with her right now.
But suffice to say that you're helping 

918
00:42:23,861 --> 00:42:28,240
facilitate some of this stuff,
but these people are completely ignored.

919
00:42:28,330 --> 00:42:29,163
Exactly.
And they're ignored by the people that 

920
00:42:31,571 --> 00:42:33,580
should care about them the most.

921
00:42:33,710 --> 00:42:34,381
Exactly.
And,

922
00:42:34,381 --> 00:42:36,790
and,
and the fact that this has no,

923
00:42:36,860 --> 00:42:37,693
I mean it's been what,
15 years since nine slash 11 happened 

924
00:42:40,130 --> 00:42:44,420
and it's been the same mentor over and 
over again that there's no policy change

925
00:42:44,720 --> 00:42:47,210
of who exactly the people we should 
start with.

926
00:42:47,570 --> 00:42:48,403
And we have a country like Saudi Arabia 
as our ally and we have Qatar that I 

927
00:42:52,330 --> 00:42:54,620
recently discovered funds the Muslim 
Brotherhood,

928
00:42:54,890 --> 00:42:55,723
which is using slave labor by the way,
to build a cub stadium to actually like 

929
00:42:59,090 --> 00:43:01,400
I want to raise this point,
which I think is very important.

930
00:43:01,401 --> 00:43:05,780
I the Muslim Brotherhood is actually 
much more dangerous than the ideology of

931
00:43:06,080 --> 00:43:06,913
Islam is because they are able to work 
on the grassroots level and also they 

932
00:43:10,221 --> 00:43:11,054
have double faces.
And what's happening is that they want 

933
00:43:13,610 --> 00:43:14,443
to say hopefully traded the US 
government because at that may say made 

934
00:43:16,370 --> 00:43:17,203
me sound like a fucking lunatic.
But they have a lot of people say it 

935
00:43:20,001 --> 00:43:20,834
though,
but there have been places in in think 

936
00:43:23,001 --> 00:43:26,730
tanks and all the shows everywhere that 
told,

937
00:43:26,840 --> 00:43:30,440
told the Western world that they,
that these other guys,

938
00:43:30,441 --> 00:43:31,274
the secretaries and stuff are traitors 
and they're not the good guys and we 

939
00:43:34,071 --> 00:43:35,270
should help us.

940
00:43:35,990 --> 00:43:38,880
So that kind of have a block for,
for a large.

941
00:43:39,210 --> 00:43:40,043
For Charles like Al Jazeera and they 
have kind of block this concept of 

942
00:43:44,151 --> 00:43:44,984
secular Arab.
It was like they wanted to push this 

943
00:43:46,611 --> 00:43:49,550
image of the authentic Arab of the 
person who,

944
00:43:49,800 --> 00:43:50,633
so this is,
we are Islamists and we'll have to 

945
00:43:52,041 --> 00:43:52,874
settle with it while in fact,
my policy and I want to change is that 

946
00:43:56,450 --> 00:43:57,283
we should change what we need to settle 
what we are asking us to subtle when I 

947
00:44:00,140 --> 00:44:00,973
should not settle with Islamic jihadist.
We have to support those who agree with 

948
00:44:05,031 --> 00:44:05,800
our values.
Yeah.

949
00:44:05,800 --> 00:44:06,633
Does all of that ring as true to you as 
it does to me in terms of that we're 

950
00:44:11,021 --> 00:44:12,840
skipping a step here.
We're,

951
00:44:12,850 --> 00:44:16,960
we're skipping caring about the right 
people because of all,

952
00:44:16,990 --> 00:44:18,550
for all the wrong reasons,
right?

953
00:44:18,910 --> 00:44:19,870
Yeah,
absolutely.

954
00:44:19,871 --> 00:44:20,750
Um,
I,

955
00:44:20,751 --> 00:44:23,830
I think it's,
it's sort of extremely symptomatic of,

956
00:44:24,430 --> 00:44:25,263
um,
sort of criticism now that that's 

957
00:44:27,371 --> 00:44:28,510
happening in,
in the left.

958
00:44:28,570 --> 00:44:30,270
And,
uh,

959
00:44:30,300 --> 00:44:31,133
I,
I,

960
00:44:31,680 --> 00:44:33,690
you know,
the,

961
00:44:34,090 --> 00:44:36,380
the,
the problem with that also is,

962
00:44:36,410 --> 00:44:39,540
is that it's created like a vacuum 
where,

963
00:44:39,570 --> 00:44:40,403
where you have like people like trump 
who was coming in and inciting inciting 

964
00:44:45,030 --> 00:44:49,530
so much hate against these people and 
blanketing,

965
00:44:49,531 --> 00:44:51,780
blanketing all Muslims and,
and that's just feeding,

966
00:44:51,781 --> 00:44:53,910
that's just feeding the ends up eating 
the problem.

967
00:44:53,950 --> 00:44:55,660
Right.
And you come from the academic world.

968
00:44:55,661 --> 00:44:56,950
I mean,
as I mentioned at the top of the show,

969
00:44:56,951 --> 00:44:59,880
you got your phd at Mit.
Oh,

970
00:44:59,890 --> 00:45:03,550
you're on your way to your phd at Mit in
genetics,

971
00:45:03,551 --> 00:45:04,271
right?
So you,

972
00:45:04,271 --> 00:45:05,320
you know,
your stuff,

973
00:45:05,321 --> 00:45:07,960
you're in the academic world.
Do you see this?

974
00:45:07,961 --> 00:45:10,330
I think one of the people,
one of the things people struggle with,

975
00:45:10,331 --> 00:45:14,710
is this coming more from the students or
the academics or is it,

976
00:45:14,711 --> 00:45:16,040
is it both?
It's

977
00:45:16,040 --> 00:45:18,800
more coming from the students for sure.
Uh,

978
00:45:18,801 --> 00:45:22,880
I would say that I'm on campus at Mit.
We haven't had that much incidents,

979
00:45:23,150 --> 00:45:25,860
but over over the,
you know,

980
00:45:26,060 --> 00:45:28,210
the t stuff at Harvard,
um,

981
00:45:28,290 --> 00:45:29,123
we had had way more,
way more incidents like recently the 

982
00:45:32,091 --> 00:45:33,920
last,
the law school had to change.

983
00:45:33,980 --> 00:45:35,810
I think they're wanting to change their,
their,

984
00:45:35,920 --> 00:45:38,210
their crest because it features three 
bushels of wheat.

985
00:45:38,630 --> 00:45:39,920
Um,
and,

986
00:45:40,010 --> 00:45:43,670
and they're also like house masters now 
I'm at the dorms.

987
00:45:43,671 --> 00:45:45,050
They,
they've lost their titles,

988
00:45:45,051 --> 00:45:48,560
they're called Dean faculty assistance 
or something.

989
00:45:48,561 --> 00:45:49,131
So,
you know,

990
00:45:49,131 --> 00:45:49,964
the question becomes what happens to 
your master's degree or like master of 

991
00:45:53,361 --> 00:45:54,140
the universe,
like,

992
00:45:54,140 --> 00:45:55,160
you know,
just words like that,

993
00:45:56,190 --> 00:45:56,751
you know,
I,

994
00:45:56,751 --> 00:45:59,570
I posted something recently about like 
in chemistry,

995
00:45:59,571 --> 00:46:00,111
they,
you know,

996
00:46:00,111 --> 00:46:00,944
the,
one of the greatest achievements in the 

997
00:46:02,900 --> 00:46:06,650
last couple of months was that they 
actually created a new synthetic element

998
00:46:06,980 --> 00:46:07,813
that stable.

999
00:46:07,820 --> 00:46:08,653
So we add it.
We completed the seventh row of the 

1000
00:46:10,131 --> 00:46:11,960
periodic table.
And,

1001
00:46:11,980 --> 00:46:16,070
and in the article they called it a 
manmade elements,

1002
00:46:16,100 --> 00:46:18,810
right?
And they had to change.

1003
00:46:19,520 --> 00:46:20,353
So they had to change the word manmade 
because people took a lot of offense at 

1004
00:46:23,601 --> 00:46:24,260
the word.
They said,

1005
00:46:24,260 --> 00:46:24,711
Oh,
you know,

1006
00:46:24,711 --> 00:46:25,431
this is,
uh,

1007
00:46:25,431 --> 00:46:26,040
it's,
it's,

1008
00:46:26,040 --> 00:46:28,130
it's excluding women.
It implies,

1009
00:46:28,131 --> 00:46:28,964
you know,
implies that it's the Patriarchy who's 

1010
00:46:30,950 --> 00:46:32,000
involved in this.
But,

1011
00:46:32,510 --> 00:46:33,321
you know,
in Latin,

1012
00:46:33,321 --> 00:46:34,154
the word madness,
his hand and man mean it doesn't really 

1013
00:46:38,061 --> 00:46:40,030
come from man.
Oh.

1014
00:46:40,040 --> 00:46:45,030
So the entomology entomology is,
you know,

1015
00:46:45,140 --> 00:46:50,120
I mean people take offense firsts and,
and that's the first reaction.

1016
00:46:50,121 --> 00:46:52,030
So I was telling face all of this many 
times.

1017
00:46:52,760 --> 00:46:54,660
The problem with what's happening,
you know,

1018
00:46:54,710 --> 00:46:58,360
in,
in the regressive left movement is,

1019
00:46:58,420 --> 00:46:59,320
is,
uh,

1020
00:46:59,410 --> 00:47:01,520
this desire to see the worst in 
everybody.

1021
00:47:02,390 --> 00:47:03,770
For example,
Matt Taylor,

1022
00:47:03,910 --> 00:47:05,900
the Rosetta Scientists,
right?

1023
00:47:05,900 --> 00:47:07,620
Who landed up the comment,
uh,

1024
00:47:07,700 --> 00:47:09,570
the probe on a comment,
um,

1025
00:47:10,070 --> 00:47:11,410
he wore a shirt,
you know,

1026
00:47:11,540 --> 00:47:16,280
inappropriate for an interview.
But the first instinct is to assume,

1027
00:47:16,380 --> 00:47:19,830
can you tell people what the shirt was?
Just this shirt had,

1028
00:47:19,850 --> 00:47:20,683
um,
it was like a tessellation of like pin 

1029
00:47:24,280 --> 00:47:27,390
up girls with guns or something.
It was a cartoon.

1030
00:47:27,391 --> 00:47:28,224
It was,
it was actually a gift from a female 

1031
00:47:29,981 --> 00:47:31,970
artist friend.
It was just a silly,

1032
00:47:32,220 --> 00:47:35,050
silly shirt.
It wasn't very graphic at all.

1033
00:47:35,051 --> 00:47:35,801
It was,
it's,

1034
00:47:35,801 --> 00:47:37,060
you know,
I mean,

1035
00:47:37,061 --> 00:47:38,440
I wouldn't wear it.
But,

1036
00:47:38,441 --> 00:47:39,510
um,
uh,

1037
00:47:39,670 --> 00:47:40,780
and,
and he wore that,

1038
00:47:40,810 --> 00:47:42,640
you know,
announcing the,

1039
00:47:42,660 --> 00:47:43,493
um,
the triumphant achievement of his team 

1040
00:47:46,320 --> 00:47:48,940
and,
and immediately just the,

1041
00:47:49,770 --> 00:47:54,770
the outcry online forced him into tears 
when he had to apologize.

1042
00:47:56,320 --> 00:47:57,153
And,
and I don't know how you make the leap 

1043
00:47:59,111 --> 00:48:04,111
from guy wearing shirt to just infer.
I mean like if I feel like a big part of

1044
00:48:06,401 --> 00:48:10,270
this is wanting to see this rate,
this racist,

1045
00:48:10,271 --> 00:48:11,230
sexist,
whatever it is,

1046
00:48:11,290 --> 00:48:12,123
intent,
the moment you catch something that may 

1047
00:48:13,841 --> 00:48:14,920
be,
you know,

1048
00:48:15,070 --> 00:48:15,903
can be interpreted that way.
They interpret it in the most extreme 

1049
00:48:18,281 --> 00:48:20,470
way.
And then the reaction starts there.

1050
00:48:20,471 --> 00:48:24,850
And then the whole outrage,
I'm industrial complex begins online.

1051
00:48:25,370 --> 00:48:26,340
Um,
and then,

1052
00:48:26,341 --> 00:48:27,670
and then after that,
it's a cycle,

1053
00:48:27,671 --> 00:48:29,140
right?
Like there's that little thing,

1054
00:48:29,141 --> 00:48:32,550
you find it and then blow up and then 
the people will criticize the blow,

1055
00:48:32,590 --> 00:48:35,440
the people who are bitching about the 
bitching and then,

1056
00:48:35,470 --> 00:48:36,340
you know,
it's just a cycle.

1057
00:48:36,400 --> 00:48:37,233
Yeah.
So what do you guys make of that mind 

1058
00:48:38,261 --> 00:48:42,430
reading portion of this?
Because psychoanalysis,

1059
00:48:42,431 --> 00:48:44,620
phds are being thrown around everywhere.
Well,

1060
00:48:44,621 --> 00:48:45,454
because when I,
the first episode of the show is you 

1061
00:48:46,781 --> 00:48:50,170
guys know what I had Sam Harris and he 
said something about the mind reading.

1062
00:48:50,350 --> 00:48:53,680
They want to just find something in you,
which is exactly what you just said.

1063
00:48:53,920 --> 00:48:56,500
And once they can find the green of 
something,

1064
00:48:56,650 --> 00:49:00,100
now they can extrapolate it into every 
which way that they want to judge you,

1065
00:49:00,580 --> 00:49:01,413
which you sold the reverse,
I think of how rational people actually 

1066
00:49:04,121 --> 00:49:07,630
operate and how evidence based people 
and people of science

1067
00:49:07,640 --> 00:49:11,530
that can also just compassion that that 
is supposedly part of liberalism,

1068
00:49:11,531 --> 00:49:12,364
right?
It should be one of the things that we 

1069
00:49:13,691 --> 00:49:16,480
aspire to is to actually see the best in
people.

1070
00:49:16,540 --> 00:49:17,590
I don't know,
but that's just me.

1071
00:49:17,800 --> 00:49:18,633
Yeah.
I mean I don't think it's just one of 

1072
00:49:19,571 --> 00:49:23,350
the things that make me sad because like
this outrage requires energy,

1073
00:49:23,410 --> 00:49:25,950
right?
So I wish that some of.

1074
00:49:25,990 --> 00:49:29,620
I mean I'm not trying to trivialize that
experience or whatever they may think of

1075
00:49:29,621 --> 00:49:30,454
me,
but I wish some of that outrage and all 

1076
00:49:32,741 --> 00:49:36,520
these hashtags would be used to advocate
for people like Lupe.

1077
00:49:36,521 --> 00:49:39,280
Now for people like Ryan,
for people who are like,

1078
00:49:39,281 --> 00:49:40,114
I wish that energy of so much out of.
I mean if they get offended by a 

1079
00:49:45,190 --> 00:49:46,023
Halloween costume,
I wish they got offended by a woman 

1080
00:49:47,561 --> 00:49:50,530
getting acid thrown in their faces by 
the Taliban in Pakistan.

1081
00:49:50,770 --> 00:49:51,603
I was offended by bloggers getting 
beheaded and in Bangladesh like I wish 

1082
00:49:56,651 --> 00:50:00,220
that some of that energy and not like 
tell them not to talk about this stuff,

1083
00:50:00,221 --> 00:50:03,850
but I wish some of that energy at least 
like maybe just 10 percent.

1084
00:50:04,270 --> 00:50:07,770
I'm not really asking for much like I 
like 10 percent is pretty good.

1085
00:50:07,771 --> 00:50:08,604
This is lower than the taxes of trump 
and 10 percent if they just use some of 

1086
00:50:14,171 --> 00:50:15,004
that outreach,
some of that energy and it creates a 

1087
00:50:16,601 --> 00:50:17,434
movement at least of solidarity.
I don't want them to donate a million 

1088
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:22,400
dollar or billion dollar.
Just a moment of solidarity.

1089
00:50:22,410 --> 00:50:23,243
They show that we people in a free 
societies side with the values you side 

1090
00:50:27,711 --> 00:50:30,200
with and that.
I mean for me when I was living there,

1091
00:50:30,201 --> 00:50:34,580
that's meant a lot to me and when people
told me that I want to replicate that to

1092
00:50:34,581 --> 00:50:37,400
help the folks over there who did that 
sense of solidarity.

1093
00:50:37,401 --> 00:50:38,234
And again it doesn't.
It show rick and tee shirt doesn't 

1094
00:50:40,460 --> 00:50:44,270
achieve a certain level of narcissism 
to.

1095
00:50:44,480 --> 00:50:49,070
Because it seems to me that when they do
this they're just saying why can't blame

1096
00:50:49,071 --> 00:50:50,150
everything on myself?

1097
00:50:50,150 --> 00:50:52,040
And now that's a problem they want,
you know what I mean?

1098
00:50:52,041 --> 00:50:53,540
If they can't link America,
there's something,

1099
00:50:53,541 --> 00:50:57,450
it's not even a problem.
So that also seems to be a bit of the.

1100
00:50:57,750 --> 00:50:58,583
And that is,
I mean look at like many of the 

1101
00:51:02,720 --> 00:51:05,330
definition of racism is power plus 
privilege,

1102
00:51:05,340 --> 00:51:07,690
right?
Is it getting it right?

1103
00:51:08,580 --> 00:51:10,420
Prevalent?
They,

1104
00:51:10,940 --> 00:51:13,940
they because they look.
So for example,

1105
00:51:13,941 --> 00:51:15,350
racism,
they redefined racism.

1106
00:51:15,351 --> 00:51:18,440
So racism is no longer about people 
hating of people of other races,

1107
00:51:18,441 --> 00:51:21,920
but rather it is who are the people on 
the privileged side.

1108
00:51:21,921 --> 00:51:23,060
So.
So it has to be.

1109
00:51:23,070 --> 00:51:25,760
So at the top of the pyramid we talked 
about last time,

1110
00:51:25,940 --> 00:51:28,430
there is a cisgender white male.
He's worse than Isis.

1111
00:51:28,790 --> 00:51:32,120
And so then there's probably isis 
because they're brown.

1112
00:51:32,350 --> 00:51:33,183
Mel's probably the,
the social media guys are mostly white 

1113
00:51:38,030 --> 00:51:39,000
but,
but uh,

1114
00:51:39,410 --> 00:51:40,243
but the other side is like a pyramid and
the top of the pyramid is white smell 

1115
00:51:44,060 --> 00:51:45,760
and they think he is the biggest 
problem.

1116
00:51:45,810 --> 00:51:49,610
So ironically what they're saying 
actually is that you as an Arab,

1117
00:51:49,970 --> 00:51:50,803
as Arab landscape man,
you could not be racist against me or 

1118
00:51:55,360 --> 00:52:00,360
against me.
But I know that someone of that,

1119
00:52:00,860 --> 00:52:01,693
an Asian person is probably lined up,
it's very sort of right next to white 

1120
00:52:05,901 --> 00:52:06,734
privilege so that you,
even if you were endorsing white 

1121
00:52:09,741 --> 00:52:13,580
genocide,
wouldn't be viewed as racist because you

1122
00:52:13,581 --> 00:52:17,270
were being oppressed and that has been 
actually like there was this case,

1123
00:52:17,271 --> 00:52:21,080
I think it was in Goldsmith University 
in which one of the students was talking

1124
00:52:21,081 --> 00:52:24,320
about a genocide,
this stock white genocide.

1125
00:52:24,560 --> 00:52:25,393
And then she said,
this is my way to surprise my 

1126
00:52:27,411 --> 00:52:28,430
grievances.
Yeah.

1127
00:52:28,431 --> 00:52:33,431
Because there's no other way to get more
creative then.

1128
00:52:33,620 --> 00:52:35,900
And then she said this is,
this is not actually racist.

1129
00:52:35,901 --> 00:52:38,210
What I was talking about because I am a 
from,

1130
00:52:38,420 --> 00:52:40,320
except the fact that she lives in 
London,

1131
00:52:40,730 --> 00:52:41,563
she's under privileged and she's trying 
to suppress our grievances against the 

1132
00:52:45,380 --> 00:52:46,640
people from the upper class.

1133
00:52:46,670 --> 00:52:47,503
This last night in the debate,
didn't Bernie say something about how 

1134
00:52:50,001 --> 00:52:52,940
white people don't know what it's like 
to be poor?

1135
00:52:53,090 --> 00:52:54,370
I mean,
something of that effect.

1136
00:52:54,380 --> 00:52:56,840
I mean,
I did not watch the debate because I was

1137
00:52:56,841 --> 00:52:57,551
out.
But uh,

1138
00:52:57,551 --> 00:53:00,440
I saw this coach has been circled.
Yeah.

1139
00:53:00,441 --> 00:53:02,000
And because they,
they,

1140
00:53:02,030 --> 00:53:04,820
they will say,
well mean some of the concept,

1141
00:53:04,821 --> 00:53:05,654
I mean I,
I'm,

1142
00:53:05,730 --> 00:53:08,120
I agree with some of the,
with it's called intersectionality.

1143
00:53:08,121 --> 00:53:08,954
I mean it may accept the fact that many 
people who say it are crazy nut jobs 

1144
00:53:12,480 --> 00:53:16,250
because it has a good concept is that 
the people who are,

1145
00:53:16,251 --> 00:53:17,084
for example,
block have less likely to get jobs 

1146
00:53:19,731 --> 00:53:21,440
because of their names.
So,

1147
00:53:21,441 --> 00:53:22,274
so it is difficult if you are a block to
raise to middle class then if you're 

1148
00:53:25,710 --> 00:53:28,590
otherwise tries to America.
So there is some truth to this.

1149
00:53:28,620 --> 00:53:29,453
But what is happening is that it is 
mixed up with so much baggage of 

1150
00:53:34,201 --> 00:53:37,050
bullshit that doesn't make sense 
anymore.

1151
00:53:37,050 --> 00:53:37,883
Just like when the,
when the far right talk about we should 

1152
00:53:39,990 --> 00:53:40,823
be fearful of all of these things.
Things except the fact that some of 

1153
00:53:43,680 --> 00:53:44,513
infiltration of the Muslim Brotherhood,
all these things like because there are 

1154
00:53:46,501 --> 00:53:49,920
so insane about so many other things 
that like whenever there's a shooting,

1155
00:53:49,921 --> 00:53:53,040
Obama's trying to take our guns,
you don't take them anywhere.

1156
00:53:53,041 --> 00:53:53,874
So whatever they say.
So what's happening with 

1157
00:53:55,120 --> 00:53:57,210
intersectionality and the people on the 
far left.

1158
00:53:57,450 --> 00:54:00,510
Some of what they say is through third 
is that there are people who are,

1159
00:54:00,750 --> 00:54:01,583
because of the rights of men,
there are studies done even based upon 

1160
00:54:04,381 --> 00:54:05,214
the name,
like if people who have like different 

1161
00:54:06,631 --> 00:54:08,460
names,
if they sound for it and whatever,

1162
00:54:08,461 --> 00:54:10,740
they are less likely to get employment.
So yes,

1163
00:54:10,741 --> 00:54:14,280
there is a sense of when somebody is 
tired to bullshit us,

1164
00:54:14,300 --> 00:54:16,800
so then they extrapolated into gaze for 
Hammas and then.

1165
00:54:16,810 --> 00:54:17,220
Yeah.
Yeah.

1166
00:54:17,220 --> 00:54:18,360
Which is valuing.
Yeah.

1167
00:54:18,390 --> 00:54:20,430
So,
so that is what that is where like the,

1168
00:54:20,460 --> 00:54:21,293
like a huge bag of bullshit is that when
all of these like intersectionality and 

1169
00:54:25,411 --> 00:54:26,880
critical race theory,
critical old,

1170
00:54:26,960 --> 00:54:28,770
literally start defending people that 
would have,

1171
00:54:28,771 --> 00:54:29,604
you can because under the name they are 
a minority and all of this eventually 

1172
00:54:33,420 --> 00:54:34,253
gets like,
it's like the destructive when it's all 

1173
00:54:36,841 --> 00:54:40,140
this stuff mixed together.
So as three people here sitting here,

1174
00:54:40,170 --> 00:54:43,080
that all came at different points in our
lives.

1175
00:54:43,081 --> 00:54:45,690
So I'm a,
I'm a third generation American.

1176
00:54:45,840 --> 00:54:46,673
Uh,
you guys are first generation but 

1177
00:54:48,390 --> 00:54:50,550
different skin colors and that,
all of that stuff,

1178
00:54:50,551 --> 00:54:52,380
we're putting it out there.
We're not fooling anybody.

1179
00:54:52,630 --> 00:54:54,180
Uh,
you sort of touched on this earlier,

1180
00:54:54,181 --> 00:54:55,014
but American exceptionalism,
do you believe in American 

1181
00:54:57,871 --> 00:55:00,220
exceptionalism?
Because I get all right.

1182
00:55:00,240 --> 00:55:01,230
I do,
I do too.

1183
00:55:01,231 --> 00:55:02,040
But

1184
00:55:02,040 --> 00:55:06,840
tell me why I like this quote by Bill 
Clinton and he said whatever is wrong in

1185
00:55:06,841 --> 00:55:09,780
America can,
can be fixed by what's rights in America

1186
00:55:10,380 --> 00:55:13,680
and as a stance now before the 
elections,

1187
00:55:13,800 --> 00:55:17,990
I can say that with a straight face.
Yeah.

1188
00:55:18,110 --> 00:55:19,040
I mean,
I'm,

1189
00:55:19,230 --> 00:55:21,420
I've always been a free speech 
absolutist.

1190
00:55:21,890 --> 00:55:23,640
Um,
and I think it's,

1191
00:55:23,670 --> 00:55:27,870
it's something that's just,
if human dignities to be upheld,

1192
00:55:28,230 --> 00:55:31,470
we should be free to express ourselves.
That's just always a basic human right.

1193
00:55:31,690 --> 00:55:35,190
Um,
and there is no other country other than

1194
00:55:35,191 --> 00:55:38,050
the United States that upholds that 
resolutely.

1195
00:55:38,100 --> 00:55:38,933
Um,

1196
00:55:39,390 --> 00:55:40,223
so doesn't that directly correlate to 
everything you do as a secularist and 

1197
00:55:44,810 --> 00:55:48,920
know what it was like to not be able to 
express all those freedoms?

1198
00:55:49,250 --> 00:55:50,083
And the reason I prefaced it by saying 
that we're all different races and all 

1199
00:55:52,551 --> 00:55:55,610
that is that we all have the same 
opportunity here.

1200
00:55:55,710 --> 00:55:56,660
Right?
Exactly.

1201
00:55:56,810 --> 00:55:57,591
Exactly.
But,

1202
00:55:57,591 --> 00:55:58,550
but people don't lift,
don't like,

1203
00:55:58,551 --> 00:55:59,384
if you say American,
do you believe in American 

1204
00:56:00,531 --> 00:56:02,120
exceptionalism?
That's a good question.

1205
00:56:02,121 --> 00:56:02,954
Actually.
I haven't thought about it that I'm 

1206
00:56:03,771 --> 00:56:04,604
putting you on the spot here.
Now we're going to get the left to hate 

1207
00:56:06,141 --> 00:56:07,310
you even more.
Yeah.

1208
00:56:07,311 --> 00:56:07,710
Well,
I,

1209
00:56:07,710 --> 00:56:09,950
I think honestly that good job 
interview,

1210
00:56:09,951 --> 00:56:10,784
but I think I do.
I mean it's really depends on what you 

1211
00:56:14,181 --> 00:56:17,820
mean by it.
People from all over the world.

1212
00:56:17,860 --> 00:56:20,160
I mean,
I live in New York City and uh,

1213
00:56:20,330 --> 00:56:21,163
I can see people from tons of living 
together for the most part peacefully 

1214
00:56:26,410 --> 00:56:29,950
and trying living under one system,
one umbrella.

1215
00:56:30,760 --> 00:56:31,241
Yes.
I mean,

1216
00:56:31,241 --> 00:56:32,074
I think it's a wonderful idea.
I think America itself is a wonderful 

1217
00:56:33,911 --> 00:56:34,744
idea is that despite the fact that 
obviously the history of it was not as 

1218
00:56:38,230 --> 00:56:41,710
beautiful as it as I wish it to be.
But I mean Jefferson,

1219
00:56:41,711 --> 00:56:42,544
who was one of my heroes called America,
the kind of experiments is that let's 

1220
00:56:46,991 --> 00:56:50,020
put these values and see how they work 
together.

1221
00:56:50,040 --> 00:56:54,220
I think for the most part to a great 
experiments that this concept of the new

1222
00:56:54,221 --> 00:56:55,660
world of,
of the,

1223
00:56:55,661 --> 00:56:56,494
of the American constitution is that one
of the first documents I was translated 

1224
00:56:59,621 --> 00:57:00,454
when I was in Iraq and trying to 
suppress the flyers around was the bill 

1225
00:57:02,801 --> 00:57:06,190
of rights of the United States.
For me it's like my Bible is like one of

1226
00:57:06,191 --> 00:57:09,520
the most important because during the 
time that it came from obviously,

1227
00:57:09,521 --> 00:57:11,020
I mean now we take it for granted.

1228
00:57:11,050 --> 00:57:12,720
People say like freedom of speech.
It's a human life.

1229
00:57:12,750 --> 00:57:13,583
But before this concept of,
of separation of powers and separation 

1230
00:57:17,051 --> 00:57:19,270
of church and state.
So for me like the most important things

1231
00:57:19,271 --> 00:57:20,104
about the American constitution,
these are used to be radical ideas back 

1232
00:57:22,751 --> 00:57:26,410
at the time and established this nation 
of from people all over the world.

1233
00:57:26,411 --> 00:57:28,060
And here we are.
I don't think this.

1234
00:57:28,120 --> 00:57:28,953
This kind of happened in medical news 
around the plant and the three of us 

1235
00:57:31,990 --> 00:57:32,823
from different parts of the wall to have
a different culture or background can 

1236
00:57:35,921 --> 00:57:37,810
come together and have a discussion 
about ideas.

1237
00:57:38,040 --> 00:57:39,580
And that's,
that's the power of ideas.

1238
00:57:39,581 --> 00:57:40,414
And I love that you brought up Thomas 
Jefferson in this because about a year 

1239
00:57:43,300 --> 00:57:45,130
ago I was at cello,
which was his home.

1240
00:57:45,450 --> 00:57:46,230
He Got Regina.
Yeah,

1241
00:57:46,230 --> 00:57:48,700
that's great.
And it's a great place and they tell his

1242
00:57:48,701 --> 00:57:53,620
story and it's really interesting 
because progress takes time so that they

1243
00:57:53,630 --> 00:57:54,400
taught,
he looked.

1244
00:57:54,400 --> 00:57:56,800
This is a man who owned slaves.
Not only did he owned slaves,

1245
00:57:56,980 --> 00:58:01,000
he had relations with at least one,
I think several of the women.

1246
00:58:01,001 --> 00:58:03,760
So he was in effect having sex with his 
slaves.

1247
00:58:03,910 --> 00:58:07,510
So obviously something's not.
I mean that's not right on many in terms

1248
00:58:07,511 --> 00:58:10,330
of slavery and women's rights and a 
zillion reasons,

1249
00:58:10,630 --> 00:58:14,200
but at the same time he was doing so 
much good for the country and so many of

1250
00:58:14,201 --> 00:58:15,034
the ideas he had lead to goodness.
So it shows that not everything is 

1251
00:58:18,430 --> 00:58:22,180
through that kernel of evil.
You want to find the goodness in people.

1252
00:58:22,250 --> 00:58:23,440
Yes,
but and,

1253
00:58:23,441 --> 00:58:24,274
and,
but there is a trend nowadays to apply 

1254
00:58:26,220 --> 00:58:27,053
modern moral framework to look at the 
past and you're starting to see that 

1255
00:58:30,951 --> 00:58:34,700
with Oxford Rhodes must fall campaign 
and things like that.

1256
00:58:34,701 --> 00:58:37,460
We're looking back into the past and now
faulting,

1257
00:58:37,730 --> 00:58:38,880
you know,
leader,

1258
00:58:38,900 --> 00:58:40,370
certainly in the history,
um,

1259
00:58:40,690 --> 00:58:42,080
for,
for views they had.

1260
00:58:42,140 --> 00:58:42,890
So

1261
00:58:42,890 --> 00:58:43,723
how dangerous do you think that is as 
someone who's sort of in the academic 

1262
00:58:45,711 --> 00:58:46,080
world?
I mean,

1263
00:58:46,080 --> 00:58:48,020
I,
I find that to be incredibly dangerous.

1264
00:58:48,021 --> 00:58:50,960
We're going to look back on everybody 
one day as,

1265
00:58:50,961 --> 00:58:51,794
as culture changes.
We're going to look back on everybody 

1266
00:58:53,520 --> 00:58:57,790
and go APP that.
Well see he was a homophobe right?

1267
00:58:57,820 --> 00:58:58,653
Yeah.
Although I think he actually said 

1268
00:58:59,451 --> 00:59:02,090
something that I should be able to get 
married or something to that effect.

1269
00:59:02,690 --> 00:59:04,190
We will be able to do that to everybody.

1270
00:59:04,390 --> 00:59:04,771
Yeah,
it,

1271
00:59:04,771 --> 00:59:05,330
it,
it's,

1272
00:59:05,330 --> 00:59:07,070
you know,
starting on campus.

1273
00:59:07,071 --> 00:59:09,620
Right?
So what Joel Wilson School,

1274
00:59:09,710 --> 00:59:13,670
and I'm at a university there,
they're debating removing his name.

1275
00:59:13,990 --> 00:59:16,130
Um,
the question is again,

1276
00:59:16,220 --> 00:59:20,720
it ultimately comes down to why do you 
feel like that helps,

1277
00:59:20,960 --> 00:59:21,641
you know,
is it,

1278
00:59:21,641 --> 00:59:25,070
is it something that's a personal,
it doesn't feel like a personal attack.

1279
00:59:25,470 --> 00:59:27,140
And,
and if we,

1280
00:59:27,170 --> 00:59:32,170
if we weigh out every single person with
that kind of moral calculus,

1281
00:59:33,920 --> 00:59:36,320
you're not gonna you're really not going
to find any.

1282
00:59:36,321 --> 00:59:37,670
Um,
uh,

1283
00:59:37,671 --> 00:59:39,300
any ideal person,
uh,

1284
00:59:39,410 --> 00:59:39,971
in the past,
right,

1285
00:59:39,971 --> 00:59:40,020
right.

1286
00:59:40,020 --> 00:59:40,853
There's literally nobody,
and that's why I keep saying the left 

1287
00:59:42,371 --> 00:59:44,860
just eats itself.
I've seen this over and over.

1288
00:59:44,861 --> 00:59:45,720
Unless your APP.
Look,

1289
00:59:45,730 --> 00:59:47,950
we can see the way sometimes even with 
Bernie,

1290
00:59:47,951 --> 00:59:48,784
they've turned on Bernie a little bit 
with some of the race issues with black 

1291
00:59:51,131 --> 00:59:53,690
lives matter and it's like here's a guy 
who was arrested in the,

1292
00:59:53,691 --> 00:59:54,524
in the sixties,
you're standing up against segregation 

1293
00:59:56,501 --> 00:59:57,334
and things like that.
So it's like you have to have a better 

1294
00:59:59,380 --> 01:00:02,320
set of principles than something that'll
just come around and get you on day.

1295
01:00:02,380 --> 01:00:04,420
Yeah.
They also talk about history.

1296
01:00:04,421 --> 01:00:07,540
I mean they're also nice to look at the 
context and the timing.

1297
01:00:07,541 --> 01:00:08,374
I mean if,
if Jefferson wanted slavery to be part 

1298
01:00:10,301 --> 01:00:11,134
of the United States,
he will have written into the 

1299
01:00:11,801 --> 01:00:13,540
constitution.
So obviously,

1300
01:00:13,541 --> 01:00:14,374
I mean the guy was sophisticated enough 
that it takes time to understand what 

1301
01:00:18,031 --> 01:00:18,820
diverse in.

1302
01:00:18,820 --> 01:00:20,430
But yeah,
when it comes to mind reading,

1303
01:00:20,480 --> 01:00:23,380
this seems like a pretty good over 
there.

1304
01:00:23,420 --> 01:00:24,370
Yeah.
It also shows,

1305
01:00:24,371 --> 01:00:25,204
I guess that we have personal short 
falls that you can somehow maybe in the 

1306
01:00:29,231 --> 01:00:31,270
public be better than you are 
personally.

1307
01:00:31,271 --> 01:00:32,104
Right.
So he's writing all of these things 

1308
01:00:33,461 --> 01:00:37,450
about equality for man clearly led the 
groundwork for you,

1309
01:00:37,451 --> 01:00:38,410
the slaves,
right?

1310
01:00:38,411 --> 01:00:39,910
Yeah.
And yet at the same time,

1311
01:00:39,911 --> 01:00:42,580
at the personal level he didn't.
So yeah,

1312
01:00:43,480 --> 01:00:45,220
certainly component.
You're talking about an hour,

1313
01:00:45,250 --> 01:00:47,560
like bringing the conversation to 
global.

1314
01:00:47,561 --> 01:00:48,394
Is that like for example,
like as I work in the human rights 

1315
01:00:50,650 --> 01:00:53,470
field,
I mean I would be honest like for starch

1316
01:00:53,500 --> 01:00:54,333
in Saudi Arabia,
I'm not going to advocate for same sex 

1317
01:00:55,661 --> 01:00:58,130
marriage,
but our advocate,

1318
01:00:58,330 --> 01:00:59,163
the concept that gays are human beings 
equal equal rights and then you can 

1319
01:01:03,611 --> 01:01:06,250
build a foundation that over time,
of course,

1320
01:01:06,320 --> 01:01:07,153
I mean I,
I saw Mike based upon many of 

1321
01:01:08,681 --> 01:01:11,200
Jefferson's readings and,
and back to the eight,

1322
01:01:11,310 --> 01:01:14,660
the life eating itself is like,
there was this congressman,

1323
01:01:15,400 --> 01:01:17,050
he's also was a civil rights icon.

1324
01:01:17,420 --> 01:01:18,820
Lewis.
His last name is Louis.

1325
01:01:18,821 --> 01:01:21,550
I forgot who endorsed Hillary Clinton.
John Lewis.

1326
01:01:21,580 --> 01:01:22,480
John Lewis.
Yes.

1327
01:01:23,380 --> 01:01:24,500
So I'm in.
I,

1328
01:01:24,520 --> 01:01:26,170
I'm not,
I cannot avoid this election shot.

1329
01:01:26,171 --> 01:01:27,004
I can bash any candidate I want,
so what happened when he endorsed 

1330
01:01:30,461 --> 01:01:32,860
Hillary?
But if somebody I agree with or don't,

1331
01:01:32,890 --> 01:01:33,723
that's irrelevant.
The amount of attacks that he got from 

1332
01:01:37,600 --> 01:01:41,740
the far left was pretty impressive about
how they are anti racist.

1333
01:01:41,890 --> 01:01:44,320
They were calling him pretty racist 
terms,

1334
01:01:44,680 --> 01:01:45,513
uncle Tom and word and overall all of 
that because he endorsed a candidate 

1335
01:01:49,691 --> 01:01:50,524
they didn't like this is itself the LF 
eating itself because they supposedly 

1336
01:01:54,030 --> 01:01:54,863
and direct service,
but there is still on their side of the 

1337
01:01:56,651 --> 01:01:57,484
ticket.
Yeah.

1338
01:01:58,050 --> 01:02:00,070
There was a quote from Fdr that I really
like.

1339
01:02:00,160 --> 01:02:00,993
It was.
He asked him why do you support the 

1340
01:02:02,290 --> 01:02:03,760
fascist in Nicaragua?
He,

1341
01:02:03,790 --> 01:02:06,170
they said he's a son of a bitch but is 
our self.

1342
01:02:06,910 --> 01:02:07,840
So,
so if,

1343
01:02:08,050 --> 01:02:08,800
if,
if,

1344
01:02:08,800 --> 01:02:09,633
uh,
Mr Lewis and drove the car day like 

1345
01:02:12,580 --> 01:02:13,420
that,
he is okay.

1346
01:02:13,421 --> 01:02:15,650
That is what that black person should 
vote for.

1347
01:02:15,680 --> 01:02:19,650
But if not,
then he is thing to talk about.

1348
01:02:19,690 --> 01:02:20,320
Uh,
they,

1349
01:02:20,320 --> 01:02:21,153
they claim to be.
I mean there is a new term called the 

1350
01:02:22,711 --> 01:02:25,190
entire racists racists,
which is interesting.

1351
01:02:25,210 --> 01:02:27,030
Yeah.
And I have double negative but,

1352
01:02:27,200 --> 01:02:28,980
and also have to work this through at 
home.

1353
01:02:29,040 --> 01:02:29,873
And also there's the Islamophobia phobia
of the fear of being perceived as 

1354
01:02:34,051 --> 01:02:37,030
Islamophobic is,
is now selected.

1355
01:02:37,040 --> 01:02:39,330
They are afraid of being perceived as 
level four,

1356
01:02:39,331 --> 01:02:41,920
a big advocate for as low phobia.
I,

1357
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:43,290
there's no doubt that that was all 
right.

1358
01:02:43,291 --> 01:02:45,540
We have to wrap up here.
So I'm going to give you the last word.

1359
01:02:46,980 --> 01:02:47,813
What can we do?
What is the number one thing we can do 

1360
01:02:49,920 --> 01:02:51,480
to help these ideas spread?

1361
01:02:51,560 --> 01:02:55,980
So what Phase I was saying about the 
outreach he wishes to divert the,

1362
01:02:55,990 --> 01:02:56,690
the,
the,

1363
01:02:56,690 --> 01:02:57,523
the outrage manufactured by all these 
small little incursions into global 

1364
01:03:01,431 --> 01:03:02,370
issues.
Um,

1365
01:03:02,600 --> 01:03:03,433
I think that's actually something that 
he's working on on movements and it's a 

1366
01:03:06,711 --> 01:03:07,544
very worthwhile cause because with that 
we can engage people who do live in 

1367
01:03:11,301 --> 01:03:12,134
western democracies to be more active 
and to be more aware of the perspective 

1368
01:03:15,140 --> 01:03:19,790
of what's going on with the persecution 
that's going on in closed societies.

1369
01:03:20,090 --> 01:03:23,480
So that's for me very.
I'm a very key thing.

1370
01:03:23,540 --> 01:03:25,940
Yeah.
And while we have our power of freedom,

1371
01:03:25,941 --> 01:03:27,200
we may as well use it.
Right.

1372
01:03:27,410 --> 01:03:28,243
Alright.
Well I have a feeling we're going to 

1373
01:03:29,001 --> 01:03:30,830
continue this in the green room because 
we barely.

1374
01:03:30,980 --> 01:03:32,540
I didn't even pick this thing up.
All right.

1375
01:03:32,740 --> 01:03:33,573
Uh,
well for more of the work that Faisal 

1376
01:03:35,061 --> 01:03:35,894
and Melissa do,
check out the global secular humanist 

1377
01:03:37,611 --> 01:03:40,160
movement on facebook.
Go to movements.org.

1378
01:03:40,161 --> 01:03:42,470
And thank you guys for watching.
I will do it again next week.
