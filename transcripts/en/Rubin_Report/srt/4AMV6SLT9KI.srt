1
00:00:05,080 --> 00:00:07,900
Suddenly it seems the entire country is 
talking about the.

2
00:00:07,901 --> 00:00:10,180
All right,
so I guess it's our turn as well.

3
00:00:10,210 --> 00:00:14,380
For those of you who are tuned to the 
Wacky wild underside of the Internet,

4
00:00:14,440 --> 00:00:17,800
you know that the alt right has existed 
for a couple of years now,

5
00:00:18,100 --> 00:00:22,180
but it's only in the last few days that 
the mainstream has started talking about

6
00:00:22,181 --> 00:00:23,320
it.
Last week,

7
00:00:23,321 --> 00:00:24,154
Hillary Clinton attack me all right,
and a big speech which lead to coverage 

8
00:00:27,641 --> 00:00:30,970
in every newspaper and online outlet 
across the globe.

9
00:00:31,360 --> 00:00:35,680
Hillary blamed Breitbart.com
for mainstreaming racism,

10
00:00:35,681 --> 00:00:39,880
which she said was proven by trump's 
embrace of the alt right.

11
00:00:40,150 --> 00:00:40,983
CNN and Fox News both aired clips from 
the Rubin report in which Milo 

12
00:00:45,340 --> 00:00:46,173
Yiannopoulos talked about the alt right,
explaining it as a counter culture 

13
00:00:49,091 --> 00:00:49,924
movement,
uniting disaffected conservatives with 

14
00:00:52,721 --> 00:00:56,590
mischievous Internet meme makers,
the usual pundant.

15
00:00:56,591 --> 00:00:57,424
Suddenly we're all experts on the 
alright even though they didn't know 

16
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:03,160
what it was while it was growing right 
before their eyes.

17
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:07,450
This whole time,
our outrage culture always need some new

18
00:01:07,451 --> 00:01:10,810
outrage to be outraged about,
and once Hillary mentioned the alt right

19
00:01:10,811 --> 00:01:11,644
by name,
it meant the movement had officially 

20
00:01:13,571 --> 00:01:14,404
arrived.
The Albright seems to take many 

21
00:01:16,691 --> 00:01:18,970
different forms depending on who you 
talk to,

22
00:01:19,030 --> 00:01:22,330
mainstream media and pretty much the 
entire left brand,

23
00:01:22,331 --> 00:01:25,030
the alt right as a white supremacists 
movement,

24
00:01:25,031 --> 00:01:28,360
rallying around Donald Trump.
Their members hate blacks.

25
00:01:28,361 --> 00:01:30,430
They hate Jews,
they hate Hispanics,

26
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:35,020
and they want some sort of racially pure
country to stop white genocide.

27
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:36,273
Mainstream Republicans see the alt right
as a group of loud mouth defensive 

28
00:01:40,271 --> 00:01:41,104
racist who are tearing the conservative 
movement apart by throwing away 

29
00:01:44,140 --> 00:01:48,580
traditional conservative ideals like 
small government and replacing them with

30
00:01:48,581 --> 00:01:49,414
a win at all costs.
Candidate other say the outright is a 

31
00:01:52,211 --> 00:01:53,044
grassroots movement born out of natural 
pushback to are increasingly political 

32
00:01:57,311 --> 00:01:58,144
correct society.
I think if you mix some of those 

33
00:02:00,101 --> 00:02:04,210
explanations together,
you get what the all or I really is,

34
00:02:04,540 --> 00:02:06,520
but you have to add one more thing.

35
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:09,410
The Internet,
the alt right,

36
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:10,273
whatever version of it you claimed to be
was created right here on the Internet 

37
00:02:15,290 --> 00:02:17,660
and as something created by the 
Internet,

38
00:02:17,750 --> 00:02:20,870
it is as amorphous as the Internet 
itself.

39
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:24,830
What the alt right really is though is a
band of a meme,

40
00:02:24,831 --> 00:02:25,664
posters,
Anamae avatars and twitter eggs vying 

41
00:02:28,671 --> 00:02:29,504
for attention from people in power.
They posted Nazi means racist pictures 

42
00:02:33,861 --> 00:02:34,694
and offensive tweets with the express 
intent of getting powerful people to 

43
00:02:38,511 --> 00:02:40,010
react,
respond,

44
00:02:40,220 --> 00:02:41,053
and thus amplify their message.
They are keyboard warriors and 

45
00:02:44,211 --> 00:02:45,044
professional trolls,
trying to get attention from the sold 

46
00:02:47,421 --> 00:02:50,840
out and corrupt media and political 
elite that we have.

47
00:02:51,290 --> 00:02:52,123
The real alright isn't about one 
political ideology as much as it is a 

48
00:02:56,541 --> 00:02:57,374
loosely linked group of people using 
tools of the Internet to upset the 

49
00:03:01,241 --> 00:03:03,190
establishment.
Ironically,

50
00:03:03,191 --> 00:03:08,191
in some ways this wrangling and mocking 
of the establishment is exactly what the

51
00:03:08,530 --> 00:03:09,610
Bernie Revolution was supposed to be.

52
00:03:09,910 --> 00:03:12,580
But while Hillary put Bernie's 
revolution on ice,

53
00:03:12,581 --> 00:03:17,560
she is now elevated the alright to 
mainstream status by giving a big speech

54
00:03:17,561 --> 00:03:18,394
about it.
The alright wants attention more than 

55
00:03:20,351 --> 00:03:24,670
anything and they trolled her into 
giving them exactly what they want.

56
00:03:24,930 --> 00:03:25,763
Let me back up here for a sec because I 
don't want to gloss over that whole 

57
00:03:27,431 --> 00:03:29,680
white supremacist.
Hate the blacks hate the Jews.

58
00:03:29,681 --> 00:03:33,640
Kick out the Hispanics thing.
This portion of the alt right absolutely

59
00:03:33,641 --> 00:03:37,060
does exist.
I see it on twitter every single day.

60
00:03:37,270 --> 00:03:38,103
You can pause this video right now and 
find thousands of images including Nazi 

61
00:03:41,561 --> 00:03:43,900
imagery,
racist characatures of minorities,

62
00:03:43,901 --> 00:03:46,330
and plenty more.
Do a quick search on twitter,

63
00:03:46,331 --> 00:03:50,590
a scan on reddit or a look at four Chan 
and you'll see some pretty nasty stuff.

64
00:03:51,010 --> 00:03:51,843
I don't like it,
but you guys know my policy on free 

65
00:03:54,041 --> 00:03:54,874
speech and free expression,
so I choose to ignore these images and 

66
00:03:57,911 --> 00:03:59,680
ideas rather than amplify them.

67
00:04:00,130 --> 00:04:00,963
The real question though is do these 
truly hateful racist means in tweets 

68
00:04:05,140 --> 00:04:10,140
represent a real movement of hate or 
they designed just to get attention?

69
00:04:10,570 --> 00:04:11,403
I think it's some combination of both,
some true racist mixed with a bunch of 

70
00:04:15,491 --> 00:04:17,920
people who just want to mess with those.
Empower.

71
00:04:18,310 --> 00:04:21,460
How many of each of them are there?
We have no idea.

72
00:04:21,490 --> 00:04:22,323
What we do know though is that these 
people will very little real world 

73
00:04:26,981 --> 00:04:29,770
power.
Dwight's premises exist.

74
00:04:29,771 --> 00:04:33,040
Yeah.
The Black Jew and Hispanic haters exist.

75
00:04:33,041 --> 00:04:34,370
Yeah,
they do too.

76
00:04:34,410 --> 00:04:37,510
Some people want to keep immigrants out 
because of racism.

77
00:04:37,570 --> 00:04:38,403
Yes,
but the people who make up the right 

78
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:43,090
aren't the ones with the power.
Instead,

79
00:04:43,091 --> 00:04:45,940
they are the ones trying to upset the 
people in power,

80
00:04:46,270 --> 00:04:47,103
and as for Donald Trump,
he has blacks and Jews and Hispanics on 

81
00:04:49,781 --> 00:04:50,614
his campaign staff.
This doesn't mean there aren't racists 

82
00:04:53,131 --> 00:04:54,400
supporters of trump.

83
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:55,713
Of course there are just as they're a 
racist supporters of Hillary and 

84
00:04:57,881 --> 00:04:58,714
everyone else to ever run for president 
ever trumps blunt language which has 

85
00:05:02,981 --> 00:05:03,814
attacked almost every group out there 
often blurring the line between being 

86
00:05:07,571 --> 00:05:12,571
politically incorrect and truly hateful 
is just an extension of the tactics that

87
00:05:12,971 --> 00:05:16,090
the alt right keyboard warriors are 
doing on their own.

88
00:05:17,140 --> 00:05:20,950
Personally,
I think that the regressive left is more

89
00:05:20,951 --> 00:05:23,680
of a threat to our democracy than the 
all right.

90
00:05:23,980 --> 00:05:24,813
The regressive left with its tactics of 
stifling debate and silencing critics 

91
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:33,010
has gained mainstream traction in our 
media and in our universities.

92
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:34,233
These regressive,
not progressive ideas have become all 

93
00:05:37,841 --> 00:05:38,674
too common on the left and they've 
actually given birth to the natural 

94
00:05:42,191 --> 00:05:43,570
response,
the alt right.

95
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:46,930
I know this firsthand not only from the 
emails that you guys send me,

96
00:05:46,931 --> 00:05:47,764
but also from all the students at Ucla 
who came up to me after my event with 

97
00:05:51,431 --> 00:05:52,264
Milo Yiannopoulos a couple months ago to
tell me that they're supporting trump 

98
00:05:55,750 --> 00:06:00,500
just because they can't take the culture
of fear around speech anymore.

99
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:04,520
The alt right with its trump frogs and 
photoshop.

100
00:06:04,521 --> 00:06:05,354
Pictures of sick Hillary is little more 
than a bunch of guys in their basements 

101
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:09,673
using outreach culture against itself.
Most of us are not part of the 

102
00:06:13,101 --> 00:06:17,090
regressive left or the alright.
This is precisely why we must talk about

103
00:06:17,091 --> 00:06:21,860
ideas honestly and not let the extremes 
on either side control the debate.

104
00:06:22,130 --> 00:06:22,963
As I've said many times before,
trump's wall might not be sensible or 

105
00:06:26,361 --> 00:06:27,194
sound policy,
but a wall in and of itself is not 

106
00:06:30,051 --> 00:06:30,884
racist.
If we refused to have a conversation 

107
00:06:33,321 --> 00:06:37,550
about immigration without yelling racist
at everyone who disagrees with us,

108
00:06:37,820 --> 00:06:41,780
then we'll leave the conversation to 
anyone who comes up with an easy answer.

109
00:06:42,020 --> 00:06:46,880
Trump's wall is the easy answer to a 
complex immigration problem and it's one

110
00:06:46,881 --> 00:06:49,130
of the reasons that the alt right loves 
him.

111
00:06:49,490 --> 00:06:54,490
The alt right is the organic result of a
politically correct society that refuses

112
00:06:54,710 --> 00:06:56,930
to engage in ideas in an honest way.

113
00:06:57,170 --> 00:06:59,780
That doesn't mean the alt right is 
right.

114
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:04,580
It just means that they're here and to 
demonize them without understanding them

115
00:07:04,581 --> 00:07:07,580
doesn't stop them.
It actually strengthens them.

116
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:09,073
My guest this week is Scott.
Adam Scott is the creator of the 

117
00:07:11,151 --> 00:07:13,580
nationally syndicated comic strip,
Dilbert,

118
00:07:13,581 --> 00:07:16,970
as well as a proponent of Donald Trump's
tactics.

119
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:20,000
I don't know if he considers himself 
part of the alt right,

120
00:07:20,001 --> 00:07:20,834
but I would consider him part of it as 
someone who's using Internet culture to 

121
00:07:24,231 --> 00:07:27,620
spread his ideas during this insane 
election cycle.

122
00:07:27,830 --> 00:07:31,520
We're going to dive into his feelings 
about Donald trump and much more.

123
00:07:31,850 --> 00:07:32,683
We'll be all right.
Twitter Nazis make memes of us in Nazi 

124
00:07:35,241 --> 00:07:36,680
costumes.
After the interview,

125
00:07:37,070 --> 00:07:39,230
you'll only know if we retweet them 
ourselves.

126
00:07:44,410 --> 00:07:45,243
My guest this week is an author and 
creator of the legendary dilbert comic 

127
00:07:48,041 --> 00:07:49,360
strip,
Scott Adams.

128
00:07:49,450 --> 00:07:51,550
Welcome to the Rubin report.
Thanks for having me.

129
00:07:51,790 --> 00:07:54,730
I'm very excited to talk to you,
but before we get into anything,

130
00:07:54,731 --> 00:07:59,731
you've also received the Rubin Award,
which is for outstanding cartoonists.

131
00:08:01,060 --> 00:08:03,280
They spell it the other way though.
Coincidentally.

132
00:08:03,281 --> 00:08:04,114
Yes.
Although it's not as prestigious as you 

133
00:08:06,761 --> 00:08:07,594
might think because they changed the 
rules some years ago that you couldn't 

134
00:08:09,941 --> 00:08:13,480
win it more than once a and there aren't
that many cartoonists in the world,

135
00:08:14,060 --> 00:08:18,130
so if you stay alive long enough,
you got a good shot at a Rubin Award,

136
00:08:18,190 --> 00:08:20,850
then you're pretty much good to win one,
but you want it back.

137
00:08:20,890 --> 00:08:23,120
That's silver 15 years ago or something.
Right.

138
00:08:23,380 --> 00:08:25,420
You want it.
Which is amazing because I'm so young.

139
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:27,940
So there you go.
All right,

140
00:08:27,941 --> 00:08:28,774
well,
I'm very excited to talk to you and 

141
00:08:29,411 --> 00:08:30,190
we're gonna.
We're gonna.

142
00:08:30,190 --> 00:08:33,490
Definitely do the politics stuff and the
trump stuff and all that,

143
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:34,833
but first for the people that probably 
know dilbert but don't know much about 

144
00:08:37,811 --> 00:08:39,440
you personally,
uh,

145
00:08:39,460 --> 00:08:41,190
you have a sort of interesting 
backstory.

146
00:08:41,220 --> 00:08:42,053
What kind of led you to becoming a 
cartoon and it's everything you used to 

147
00:08:44,891 --> 00:08:48,730
be a regular working man,
is that fair to say?

148
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:50,141
Yeah,
it was.

149
00:08:50,141 --> 00:08:50,974
I worked in two big companies now 
working in a big bank in a cubicle and 

150
00:08:53,681 --> 00:08:56,100
then I went to the phone and worked in 
another

151
00:08:56,100 --> 00:08:58,970
cubicle and I,
um,

152
00:08:59,430 --> 00:09:00,360
I actually,
my,

153
00:09:00,390 --> 00:09:02,790
both of my career has ended the same 
way.

154
00:09:02,850 --> 00:09:04,830
I keep forgetting I can say anything I 
want on here.

155
00:09:04,831 --> 00:09:06,690
You can say absolutely anything for 
years.

156
00:09:06,700 --> 00:09:07,533
There are things that I've sort of 
censor it or played down in my 

157
00:09:09,991 --> 00:09:10,824
backstory,
but let's break you out of self 

158
00:09:12,031 --> 00:09:13,860
censorship right now.
I'll put it right down there.

159
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:14,810
Yeah.
Um,

160
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:15,713
my banking career ended when my boss 
called me in her office and told me in 

161
00:09:20,031 --> 00:09:24,300
direct language as directly as I'm going
to tell you that she couldn't promote me

162
00:09:24,510 --> 00:09:27,150
anytime in the future because I'm a 
white male.

163
00:09:27,650 --> 00:09:28,483
Wow.
And she said it wasn't discrimination 

164
00:09:30,091 --> 00:09:32,880
per se in the normal sense,
it was that the,

165
00:09:32,881 --> 00:09:33,714
I guess the local newspaper had 
discovered that there was no diversity 

166
00:09:36,930 --> 00:09:40,170
in senior management and in order to 
reverse that,

167
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:43,290
since the pipeline wasn't as good as it 
should've been in either,

168
00:09:43,650 --> 00:09:47,670
they pretty much just had to stop 
promoting people who look like me.

169
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:49,050
Wow.
So I said,

170
00:09:49,230 --> 00:09:51,090
well,
how long is that going to last?

171
00:09:52,050 --> 00:09:54,480
And she said something like,
well,

172
00:09:54,481 --> 00:09:59,190
it took 200 years to get here.
So it might take awhile to reverse this.

173
00:09:59,670 --> 00:10:02,220
I made up that part,
but that was implied.

174
00:10:02,590 --> 00:10:06,540
Um,
so I put my resume together and I left,

175
00:10:07,260 --> 00:10:10,470
went to Pacific Bell,
started working there.

176
00:10:10,471 --> 00:10:12,510
I got,
got on the fast track.

177
00:10:12,690 --> 00:10:16,290
I was identified as an up and comer who 
was ready for management.

178
00:10:16,590 --> 00:10:20,610
And one day my boss called me into his 
office and he sat down and I had to tell

179
00:10:20,611 --> 00:10:22,260
you this,
but the word has come down.

180
00:10:22,261 --> 00:10:25,110
I can't promote white males.
Wow.

181
00:10:25,290 --> 00:10:26,123
And it's,
it was the same reason it was the 

182
00:10:27,390 --> 00:10:28,223
newspaper had discovered that they too 
had a problem with diversity as senior 

183
00:10:31,801 --> 00:10:32,634
management.
So that was the point that as I like to 

184
00:10:35,911 --> 00:10:37,290
say,
when you hear the story,

185
00:10:37,291 --> 00:10:38,700
you say to yourself,
wow,

186
00:10:38,701 --> 00:10:40,710
that must have been a really bad day for
you,

187
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:42,233
but turns out that the moment you 
realized that your efforts and your 

188
00:10:45,781 --> 00:10:49,680
outcomes are not related,
it really frees up your schedule.

189
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:54,030
So suddenly I taed for hobbies.
I wasn't coming in so early,

190
00:10:54,031 --> 00:10:54,864
I wasn't working so late.
I started looking for other things to 

191
00:10:57,751 --> 00:10:58,680
do.
Yeah,

192
00:10:58,730 --> 00:11:01,920
the things that I could control my own 
fate a little bit.

193
00:11:02,670 --> 00:11:03,503
So one of the things I tried to do,
and it's one of the many things I've 

194
00:11:05,731 --> 00:11:07,620
tried to do both before and after 
Gilbert,

195
00:11:07,650 --> 00:11:11,490
was to get a comic strip published,
didn't know how to do that.

196
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:13,380
Um,
and you know,

197
00:11:13,420 --> 00:11:14,620
how do you do that?
Like what's the,

198
00:11:14,850 --> 00:11:17,250
what's the process for getting a comic 
strip started?

199
00:11:17,550 --> 00:11:18,383
This was pre internet.
You couldn't find out anything free 

200
00:11:20,491 --> 00:11:23,280
Internet.
Hard to believe that time existed.

201
00:11:23,281 --> 00:11:25,830
It was the time.
But this is a true story.

202
00:11:25,831 --> 00:11:26,664
It's a,
this is sort of the amazing luck part 

203
00:11:28,830 --> 00:11:30,840
that everybody has in their story.
At some point,

204
00:11:31,210 --> 00:11:32,550
you know,
any successful person,

205
00:11:32,551 --> 00:11:34,620
if you look at their story,
it's like I worked hard,

206
00:11:34,621 --> 00:11:35,730
I worked harder,
I worked hard.

207
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:39,240
This really fricking lucky thing.
And then something good happened.

208
00:11:39,300 --> 00:11:40,133
Yeah.
So in my context where lots of things 

209
00:11:41,671 --> 00:11:42,504
that didn't work out for me,
but I got real lucky this time and I 

210
00:11:45,121 --> 00:11:46,230
was,
I came home,

211
00:11:46,231 --> 00:11:48,390
I was thinking to myself,
how do I become a cartoonist?

212
00:11:48,830 --> 00:11:49,663
And I was flipping through the channels 
on TV and it was a TV show on how to 

213
00:11:53,921 --> 00:11:55,240
become a cartoonist.
Well,

214
00:11:56,020 --> 00:11:58,750
but I'd missed like 28 minutes of the 
half hour,

215
00:11:58,840 --> 00:11:59,673
right?
And I just figured out what that's what 

216
00:12:01,001 --> 00:12:01,834
that must have been about.
And I wrote down the name of the host 

217
00:12:03,911 --> 00:12:08,470
from the closing credits and I wrote him
a regular snail mail letter and I said,

218
00:12:08,471 --> 00:12:12,010
how do you become a cartoonist?
And he answered two page letter,

219
00:12:12,011 --> 00:12:12,940
said,
buy this book,

220
00:12:13,030 --> 00:12:15,520
use these materials.
And he said,

221
00:12:15,820 --> 00:12:16,653
whatever happens,
don't get discouraged because the real 

222
00:12:19,540 --> 00:12:23,080
tough industry and you know,
you'll get rejected a lot,

223
00:12:23,420 --> 00:12:24,280
you know,
don't give up.

224
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:25,680
So I,
I said,

225
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:26,381
oh,
this was great.

226
00:12:26,381 --> 00:12:27,214
I bought the book,
I got the materials and put together 

227
00:12:29,021 --> 00:12:31,030
some comics that were just single panel 
comics,

228
00:12:31,540 --> 00:12:34,360
send them off to the major magazines 
they ever rejected.

229
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:36,490
You know,
I just thought,

230
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:38,080
well,
I tried,

231
00:12:38,290 --> 00:12:40,450
right.
It's the best you can do is try.

232
00:12:41,020 --> 00:12:43,930
So I put all my materials in the closet 
and I forgot about it.

233
00:12:45,010 --> 00:12:45,843
A year goes by and one day I walk out 
into the post office or to the mailbox 

234
00:12:50,350 --> 00:12:51,183
and there's a letter there from this 
same cartoonist who had sent me the 

235
00:12:53,861 --> 00:12:54,694
original advice,
his name is Jack Cassidy and if he's 

236
00:12:57,161 --> 00:12:59,440
watching this hijack,
um,

237
00:12:59,900 --> 00:13:00,733
and he,
he said that he was cleaning his office 

238
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:07,240
and he came across my letter that was in
the bottom of a pile and he said that he

239
00:13:07,241 --> 00:13:11,560
was just writing to make sure that I 
hadn't given up.

240
00:13:11,620 --> 00:13:12,453
Wow.
And that was the only reason he wrote 

241
00:13:15,340 --> 00:13:17,590
and I had given up.
And so I thought,

242
00:13:17,591 --> 00:13:18,620
well,
maybe he knows something.

243
00:13:18,660 --> 00:13:20,440
I don't know,
maybe you see something that,

244
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:22,270
that even the,
the,

245
00:13:22,271 --> 00:13:24,310
uh,
the magazines didn't see in my work.

246
00:13:25,090 --> 00:13:27,670
So I decided to raise my sights to 
become,

247
00:13:27,700 --> 00:13:28,533
to try to become a syndicated cartoonist
and newspapers all over the world as 

248
00:13:32,321 --> 00:13:33,750
opposed to just trying to get at,
you know,

249
00:13:33,751 --> 00:13:37,600
a comic in a magazine because I figured 
if I got rejected at that,

250
00:13:38,310 --> 00:13:40,090
it would feel like progress because 
that'd be good.

251
00:13:40,091 --> 00:13:42,730
Rejected at a higher level that would 
feel good.

252
00:13:43,330 --> 00:13:46,120
Um,
I sent out my samples and united media,

253
00:13:46,150 --> 00:13:49,840
one of the big sin that gets called and 
offered me a contract.

254
00:13:49,970 --> 00:13:50,803
Yeah.
I mean that's really just a great story 

255
00:13:52,821 --> 00:13:53,654
of not just perseverance but also that 
someone else that you didn't even know 

256
00:13:57,440 --> 00:14:01,670
really dragged you back in when you were
out and also that your,

257
00:14:01,671 --> 00:14:05,540
your work before that,
you hit that dead end of,

258
00:14:06,050 --> 00:14:08,240
you know,
you're not going any further here.

259
00:14:08,330 --> 00:14:09,163
It happened to me because of your skin.
It's interesting the way you described 

260
00:14:11,361 --> 00:14:13,220
it,
you don't sound like you were,

261
00:14:13,820 --> 00:14:14,653
you sound like you sort of understood 
what they were doing even though each 

262
00:14:16,870 --> 00:14:19,550
node as against he wasn't working for 
you.

263
00:14:19,670 --> 00:14:21,770
Yeah.
I have two minds of that.

264
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:24,860
Right?
There's my social mind which says yes,

265
00:14:24,861 --> 00:14:25,694
there was no diversity in two major 
companies that that's not a longterm 

266
00:14:30,020 --> 00:14:32,900
sustainable situation in this kind of a 
country,

267
00:14:33,350 --> 00:14:34,183
so it had to be fixed and if you let it 
get fixed in its natural course of 

268
00:14:38,421 --> 00:14:40,130
events,
it would take too long.

269
00:14:40,580 --> 00:14:41,413
It just would be untenable.
And it is also true that when someone 

270
00:14:46,070 --> 00:14:46,903
who looks like me,
a white male in 1979 gets fired from a 

271
00:14:49,821 --> 00:14:50,654
job without doing bad job or in this 
case to sort of encouraged to quit 

272
00:14:55,521 --> 00:15:00,380
again.
I had lots of opportunities so it wasn't

273
00:15:00,381 --> 00:15:02,690
the worst thing in the world for me and 
it worked out well obviously.

274
00:15:02,870 --> 00:15:03,920
Yeah.
So yeah,

275
00:15:03,921 --> 00:15:06,170
I have two minds about it.
I think it was good for society,

276
00:15:06,171 --> 00:15:07,004
bad for me at that moment,
but it worked out good for me in the 

277
00:15:08,481 --> 00:15:08,870
long run.

278
00:15:08,870 --> 00:15:10,760
Yeah.
What do you think in 2016,

279
00:15:10,761 --> 00:15:11,594
if the same thing happened to sort of a 
middle management white guy and they 

280
00:15:13,911 --> 00:15:15,490
were told that now,
uh,

281
00:15:15,590 --> 00:15:18,620
do you think the reaction from the 
average person would be the same?

282
00:15:18,621 --> 00:15:20,720
Do you think a normal corporate 
atmosphere?

283
00:15:20,721 --> 00:15:22,440
Do you think they would say it in such 
sorta.

284
00:15:22,810 --> 00:15:24,850
I think everything ages certain times.
Right?

285
00:15:24,860 --> 00:15:28,010
So the tool you need know you have to 
adjust it for the time.

286
00:15:28,490 --> 00:15:29,610
If it's,
you know,

287
00:15:29,690 --> 00:15:32,120
if it's years ago and you've got to 
slavery,

288
00:15:32,510 --> 00:15:34,490
you need a civil war,
right?

289
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:37,040
You got to go for the biggest bluntness 
weapon you can,

290
00:15:37,750 --> 00:15:38,900
if it's the,
you know,

291
00:15:38,901 --> 00:15:43,901
the seventies and you still don't have 
good representation in top jobs.

292
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:48,140
You need something less blunt than a 
civil war,

293
00:15:48,620 --> 00:15:52,370
but far more blunt than doing nothing 
and just hoping for things to change.

294
00:15:52,390 --> 00:15:53,223
Yeah.
So I was in favor of a sort of a punch 

295
00:15:55,851 --> 00:15:57,380
in the nose,
sort of,

296
00:15:57,381 --> 00:15:58,214
uh,
you know,

297
00:15:58,310 --> 00:15:59,840
to try to get things kick started.

298
00:16:00,890 --> 00:16:03,650
But now I think things have improved,
right?

299
00:16:03,740 --> 00:16:04,830
Nothing's fixed.
You know,

300
00:16:04,850 --> 00:16:07,430
we haven't ended racism.
We haven't ended sexism.

301
00:16:07,431 --> 00:16:10,880
Right.
But there are pockets in which it really

302
00:16:10,881 --> 00:16:11,880
isn't a problem.
Yeah.

303
00:16:12,140 --> 00:16:14,390
There are pockets where it's probably a 
huge problem,

304
00:16:14,810 --> 00:16:18,260
but you can choose your pocket now.
So if you were somewhere where there's a

305
00:16:18,261 --> 00:16:21,050
huge problem,
we do mostly have mobility.

306
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:22,333
You can quit that job.
You can find a place where you do have 

307
00:16:24,111 --> 00:16:25,040
an advantage,
you know?

308
00:16:25,470 --> 00:16:26,303
Um,
I saw a picture today this running 

309
00:16:27,441 --> 00:16:31,100
around twitter of the Huffington Post 
editorial board.

310
00:16:31,450 --> 00:16:33,780
It's 100 percent of white women.
Oh yeah.

311
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:36,200
I've seen that before.
So if you're working for a company,

312
00:16:36,210 --> 00:16:37,700
you're a writer,
you're a white woman,

313
00:16:37,701 --> 00:16:40,700
you got discriminated against,
there is someplace you can go,

314
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:41,593
right.
We're probably something like the 

315
00:16:42,441 --> 00:16:44,370
opposite is going to happen.
Right?

316
00:16:44,630 --> 00:16:45,463
So I'm not saying that's good or bad,
I'm just saying that in the world of 

317
00:16:47,541 --> 00:16:50,480
2016 you can leave where you are,
you have,

318
00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:51,830
you know,
mobility of sorts.

319
00:16:51,830 --> 00:16:54,110
Nobody has perfect mobility,
but you can't move.

320
00:16:54,330 --> 00:16:57,380
Right?
So you can control your own fate and the

321
00:16:57,390 --> 00:16:59,660
way that you couldn't in 1979.
Right.

322
00:16:59,661 --> 00:17:02,210
And it's funny because if we're talking 
about the same Huffington post picture,

323
00:17:02,211 --> 00:17:05,000
it's a long table.
All the women and the woman who took the

324
00:17:05,001 --> 00:17:06,230
picture is saying,
oh,

325
00:17:06,231 --> 00:17:07,064
look at our diversity here.
She means diversity in that there's a 

326
00:17:09,411 --> 00:17:11,240
lot of women or something to that 
effect.

327
00:17:11,241 --> 00:17:12,074
Yeah.
And she's actually showing you that's 

328
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:16,730
just,
it's different than just all white men,

329
00:17:16,970 --> 00:17:17,803
but does that really diversity per se.
There was amazing bit of blindness that 

330
00:17:22,341 --> 00:17:25,160
someone could tweet that publicly and be
proud of it.

331
00:17:25,550 --> 00:17:28,070
Now I think we're all happy that women 
that have,

332
00:17:28,100 --> 00:17:29,180
you know,
all the opportunities.

333
00:17:29,181 --> 00:17:33,080
I have literally never met anybody who 
thought differently about that topic.

334
00:17:33,470 --> 00:17:34,303
So you believe women are equal before 
the commenters start going out and I 

335
00:17:37,191 --> 00:17:39,050
know he hates women or something.

336
00:17:39,310 --> 00:17:42,650
I believe in equal opportunity.
I think every individual is different,

337
00:17:42,940 --> 00:17:45,770
but of course you have to have equal 
access.

338
00:17:45,771 --> 00:17:47,120
Equal opportunity.
Yeah.

339
00:17:47,450 --> 00:17:48,710
Alright.
So let's jump forward.

340
00:17:48,711 --> 00:17:49,544
So now you,
you get the cartoon out there and it 

341
00:17:52,141 --> 00:17:52,974
starts taking off how much of it was 
rattling around all the ideas of 

342
00:17:56,581 --> 00:17:58,890
Dilbert,
which is very much takes place obviously

343
00:17:58,950 --> 00:18:01,620
in the time of your life that you were 
working in the corporate atmosphere.

344
00:18:01,890 --> 00:18:05,550
How much of those ideas were rattling 
around in you while you were doing it?

345
00:18:05,551 --> 00:18:06,384
I mean,
was that just your creative outlet to 

346
00:18:07,771 --> 00:18:10,510
not go crazy in a corporate job?
Well,

347
00:18:10,590 --> 00:18:11,423
it turns out that Dilbert was sort of 
the sum of all my frustrations from my 

348
00:18:15,631 --> 00:18:19,140
corporate world and it gave me an outlet
for them.

349
00:18:19,141 --> 00:18:21,120
I hadn't been thinking in terms of,
you know,

350
00:18:21,150 --> 00:18:23,100
Gosh,
I got to make a comic about that until I

351
00:18:23,101 --> 00:18:25,320
actually started working on,
um,

352
00:18:25,350 --> 00:18:29,550
but it was,
it was a handy outlet by personality.

353
00:18:30,060 --> 00:18:32,730
Um,
I'm excited by problems.

354
00:18:33,210 --> 00:18:36,060
I'm excited by chaos.
If it can,

355
00:18:36,061 --> 00:18:38,750
I swear you can swear away.
I told you no rules.

356
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:41,680
I wasn't getting a if things go to shit.
Yeah.

357
00:18:42,380 --> 00:18:46,050
Suddenly I feel good because there's 
always opportunity.

358
00:18:46,051 --> 00:18:46,860
Right,
right.

359
00:18:46,860 --> 00:18:49,230
Things are broken.
At the very least,

360
00:18:49,231 --> 00:18:51,420
there's a job for somebody who fixes 
broken stuff,

361
00:18:51,930 --> 00:18:53,490
right?
So every time something that's broken,

362
00:18:53,491 --> 00:18:53,881
I think,
ah,

363
00:18:53,881 --> 00:18:55,200
there's a,
there's an opportunity here.

364
00:18:55,560 --> 00:18:56,393
So I just love that situation.
That's probably a good segue to the 

365
00:18:58,831 --> 00:18:59,664
trump stuff,
but I want to do some other stuff 

366
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:02,970
before,
before we quite get there.

367
00:19:03,090 --> 00:19:05,850
So I was doing a little research and I 
knew you were into hypnotism.

368
00:19:06,180 --> 00:19:07,350
Well,
I haven't had to test.

369
00:19:07,530 --> 00:19:10,240
You are a trained certified hypnotist.
Yeah.

370
00:19:10,270 --> 00:19:12,420
How did that come to be?
A well,

371
00:19:12,421 --> 00:19:13,254
the back story and that is that my 
mother gave birth to my younger sister 

372
00:19:17,100 --> 00:19:18,320
while my mother was,
um,

373
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:20,370
hypnosis a while while she was 
hypnotized.

374
00:19:20,430 --> 00:19:23,280
My family doctor was a hypnotist.
Uh,

375
00:19:23,281 --> 00:19:26,100
and we hope he is a medical doctor,
but I know he was at least after this.

376
00:19:27,100 --> 00:19:28,040
Right?
Well,

377
00:19:28,041 --> 00:19:29,030
you all came out,
right?

378
00:19:29,070 --> 00:19:30,170
Yeah.
We all okay about.

379
00:19:30,460 --> 00:19:31,293
And My mother,
my mother reports that she felt no pain 

380
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:39,780
did not have any drugs during childbirth
and was awake the whole time.

381
00:19:40,550 --> 00:19:45,210
And now this is an unusual situation.
So even even though,

382
00:19:45,211 --> 00:19:46,044
well hypnotized person,
20 percent at tops could feel that kind 

383
00:19:49,561 --> 00:19:50,394
of extreme phenomena,
but the other 80 percent can be deeply 

384
00:19:53,911 --> 00:19:56,280
influenced.
And so when I heard that story,

385
00:19:56,281 --> 00:19:58,440
I was pretty young when I heard it.
I thought,

386
00:19:58,441 --> 00:20:01,560
what is the superpower and how can I get
that?

387
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:03,113
It was part of my process of trying to 
accumulate skills that would layer well 

388
00:20:08,221 --> 00:20:11,010
on whatever,
whatever I was naturally good at.

389
00:20:11,380 --> 00:20:12,210
And I thought,
well,

390
00:20:12,210 --> 00:20:13,043
knowing how the human mind works now he 
had an influence at knowing how to 

391
00:20:16,170 --> 00:20:18,840
hypnotize people has got to work 
everywhere.

392
00:20:18,870 --> 00:20:20,820
Right?
Where would that not be a good idea?

393
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,080
Right?
Uh,

394
00:20:22,081 --> 00:20:24,120
so do you practice it some.
I mean,

395
00:20:24,121 --> 00:20:28,470
do people come to you if someone say,
I have a smoking problem or uh,

396
00:20:28,471 --> 00:20:30,270
you know,
I eat too much or something and you say,

397
00:20:30,271 --> 00:20:33,300
well,
I want to be hit and Desi and how do you

398
00:20:33,301 --> 00:20:34,260
use it?
Actually.

399
00:20:34,350 --> 00:20:36,180
So I've sentenced,
broadened what I,

400
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:41,040
what I call it hypnosis to include 
anything in the field of persuasion,

401
00:20:41,041 --> 00:20:44,430
influence it could be advertising a,
you know,

402
00:20:44,431 --> 00:20:45,900
in the,
in the dating realm,

403
00:20:45,930 --> 00:20:48,370
you know,
Game Theory or whatever it's called.

404
00:20:48,850 --> 00:20:49,740
Um,
so there,

405
00:20:49,741 --> 00:20:51,400
there are a million forms of it,
but it's all,

406
00:20:51,460 --> 00:20:55,420
it's all about how to influence people 
in there in the irrational sense.

407
00:20:55,480 --> 00:20:58,360
Right?
So you could be using some of the basics

408
00:20:58,361 --> 00:21:00,790
of hypnotism right now,
but you're not putting.

409
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:02,370
So people think of hypnotism,
I like,

410
00:21:02,410 --> 00:21:05,590
I'm waiting for you to pull out the Stop
Watch and put me to sleep.

411
00:21:05,591 --> 00:21:06,424
But you're saying there's,
there's sort of skills and lessons you 

412
00:21:09,071 --> 00:21:11,170
learned in that,
that you can apply that you probably put

413
00:21:11,171 --> 00:21:15,040
into Dilbert and that you certainly are 
using on twitter and things like that.

414
00:21:15,070 --> 00:21:18,190
So when I was learning hypnosis,
of course I was doing the,

415
00:21:18,350 --> 00:21:19,183
you know,
putting people in so-called hypnosis 

416
00:21:21,461 --> 00:21:22,294
trances and uh,
doing things like having them remember 

417
00:21:25,001 --> 00:21:27,130
their past lives,
which by the way is not real.

418
00:21:27,210 --> 00:21:28,043
The past life things that really.
Cause I know a couple of people reading 

419
00:21:31,441 --> 00:21:34,630
that journey of souls know that during 
the sit bone,

420
00:21:34,680 --> 00:21:37,500
but it's all about the past life 
regression and that whole thing.

421
00:21:37,501 --> 00:21:37,730
Again,

422
00:21:37,730 --> 00:21:38,910
I can tell you,
I,

423
00:21:39,030 --> 00:21:42,810
as practice,
I would run a little ad in the local rag

424
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:44,820
to say,
come in for $20.

425
00:21:44,821 --> 00:21:45,654
I will hypnotize you,
wouldn't show you your past lives and 

426
00:21:48,331 --> 00:21:49,164
person after person came in and sure 
enough under hypnosis they could 

427
00:21:51,780 --> 00:21:56,780
remember past lives.
But at the time I thought I was actually

428
00:21:56,971 --> 00:21:58,170
open minded about it.
I was like,

429
00:21:58,770 --> 00:22:00,030
well maybe.
I mean,

430
00:22:00,031 --> 00:22:02,980
how do you rule it out?
But I'd have to do a few.

431
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:06,240
You realize that none of them have lives
that you haven't seen on television.

432
00:22:07,470 --> 00:22:09,210
Like nobody said.
Yeah,

433
00:22:09,211 --> 00:22:10,044
I was,
uh,

434
00:22:10,220 --> 00:22:12,170
I was an Ethiopian,
you know,

435
00:22:12,180 --> 00:22:14,550
something that you wouldn't know what,
how their life was.

436
00:22:14,970 --> 00:22:19,970
Everybody was an Egyptian princess or a 
viking or a cowboy.

437
00:22:22,410 --> 00:22:26,100
I think the most exotic Wa was a French 
surf,

438
00:22:26,550 --> 00:22:29,400
you know,
and I'm thinking nobody's.

439
00:22:29,830 --> 00:22:30,780
Oh,
and here's the other thing.

440
00:22:30,781 --> 00:22:31,614
I had person after person come in and 
not one of them was Chinese in a prior 

441
00:22:36,271 --> 00:22:39,020
life and do some math,
math.

442
00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:39,750
Right,
right.

443
00:22:39,750 --> 00:22:41,390
Man.
And there's a lot of China,

444
00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:42,693
a lot of Chinese people.
Somebody was Chinese and her prayer 

445
00:22:44,761 --> 00:22:45,594
life.
And if,

446
00:22:45,630 --> 00:22:47,310
if there were such things as prior life.

447
00:22:47,410 --> 00:22:48,243
Right.
So what do you think that tells you 

448
00:22:48,731 --> 00:22:52,180
about the human psyche or the human 
condition that people,

449
00:22:52,420 --> 00:22:57,220
you'd put them under Gnosis,
which you believe is a good practice and

450
00:22:57,221 --> 00:22:59,530
that ultimately there.
So you would say that that's.

451
00:22:59,531 --> 00:23:04,150
Then their site subconscious.
That's just exercising itself.

452
00:23:04,151 --> 00:23:05,080
It's just,
yeah,

453
00:23:05,450 --> 00:23:07,930
it's combining with their ego to like 
just make up stories.

454
00:23:08,050 --> 00:23:08,883
It's not just their subconscious is the 
fact that the hypnotist has implanted 

455
00:23:12,521 --> 00:23:15,310
the suggestion that they can retrieve 
their past memory,

456
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:19,480
and so that's enough that they imagine 
that they are having actual memories.

457
00:23:19,570 --> 00:23:20,403
Yeah.
The main thing you learn to practice 

458
00:23:23,291 --> 00:23:28,000
hypnosis to be a hypnotist is you have 
to understand that people are irrational

459
00:23:28,420 --> 00:23:32,350
all the time about everything,
and if you don't understand that,

460
00:23:32,351 --> 00:23:36,220
you can't even do it because none of it 
would make sense for a rational person.

461
00:23:36,221 --> 00:23:37,420
People aren't.
You know,

462
00:23:37,421 --> 00:23:41,950
if you think people are affected by data
and facts and good arguments,

463
00:23:42,100 --> 00:23:46,010
you can't even do hypnosis.
The whole thing just falls apart.

464
00:23:46,670 --> 00:23:47,503
You wait.
You don't think everyone though is like 

465
00:23:48,831 --> 00:23:49,260
that,
right?

466
00:23:49,260 --> 00:23:54,200
You think 100 percent of the world are 
rational pretty much all the time.

467
00:23:54,201 --> 00:23:55,034
The Times when you're not or trivial,
so you know if you're balancing your 

468
00:23:57,891 --> 00:23:58,724
checkbook or or,
or trying to decide which object is 

469
00:24:01,191 --> 00:24:05,390
heavier and how much you need to lift it
as probably a rational decision,

470
00:24:05,420 --> 00:24:07,640
but those are trivial in terms of our 
lives.

471
00:24:07,970 --> 00:24:09,470
It's not going to affect the house you 
live,

472
00:24:09,500 --> 00:24:13,100
you decide to live in the job,
you take the person you marry.

473
00:24:13,370 --> 00:24:14,540
It's not gonna Affect,
you know,

474
00:24:14,730 --> 00:24:15,590
uh,
the way you,

475
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:19,550
even the way you dress most of the time.
It certainly won't affect your political

476
00:24:19,551 --> 00:24:20,480
choices.
Right?

477
00:24:20,481 --> 00:24:21,314
Right.
So you would say those choices are done 

478
00:24:22,521 --> 00:24:25,100
in an irrational manner for most people 
buying a house.

479
00:24:25,101 --> 00:24:25,934
I mean people spend a lot of time 
figuring out what house to buy or what 

480
00:24:27,981 --> 00:24:31,760
career to go and do you think those are 
done it through irrational.

481
00:24:32,280 --> 00:24:33,113
We make our decisions about people and 
things and the first few seconds and 

482
00:24:36,111 --> 00:24:38,300
then everything after that is a 
rationalization.

483
00:24:38,780 --> 00:24:40,940
I'll give you a perfect examples from my
life.

484
00:24:41,270 --> 00:24:46,220
A few prior relationships ago,
we were looking for a house,

485
00:24:46,250 --> 00:24:48,290
looked at a bunch of them.
We both did like him.

486
00:24:48,680 --> 00:24:50,150
We drove up to the house.

487
00:24:50,150 --> 00:24:55,100
We ended up buying sat in the car 
without even going inside the house.

488
00:24:55,550 --> 00:24:58,780
Looked at each other and laughed because
that was our house [inaudible].

489
00:24:58,790 --> 00:24:59,630
That was it.
Yeah.

490
00:24:59,930 --> 00:25:03,470
And I don't know why,
I just had a look at a feel,

491
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:06,500
but without even seeing the inside of 
the house without knowing,

492
00:25:06,760 --> 00:25:07,593
you know,
what we would pay or anything like that 

493
00:25:09,141 --> 00:25:11,150
we had decided in.
Sure enough we bought that house.

494
00:25:11,260 --> 00:25:12,320
Yeah.
Likewise.

495
00:25:12,321 --> 00:25:14,090
It didn't work out.
That was great.

496
00:25:14,180 --> 00:25:16,640
Yeah.
And another relationship,

497
00:25:16,650 --> 00:25:18,200
we're looking for a car,
you know,

498
00:25:18,340 --> 00:25:20,900
with my ex wife,
looked at car after car.

499
00:25:20,901 --> 00:25:21,734
We pulled into one dealer,
stood there and looked at the car and I 

500
00:25:23,721 --> 00:25:26,000
just laughed because I didn't know 
anything about the guard,

501
00:25:26,001 --> 00:25:27,950
didn't know the specs to know the 
mileage.

502
00:25:28,130 --> 00:25:28,963
It didn't know anything.
I just knew that was going to be our 

503
00:25:29,901 --> 00:25:30,950
car.
Sure enough.

504
00:25:31,430 --> 00:25:32,263
Yeah.
So for the people that go to a good 

505
00:25:34,131 --> 00:25:34,964
Julian houses and inspect every inch or 
that go to 27 car dealerships and all 

506
00:25:39,651 --> 00:25:41,510
that,
that's a,

507
00:25:41,660 --> 00:25:42,910
it's sort of,
you would describe that.

508
00:25:42,911 --> 00:25:44,750
That's just sort of a different way of 
doing things.

509
00:25:44,751 --> 00:25:48,920
You're sort of going to find a feeling 
that's going to appear.

510
00:25:48,921 --> 00:25:51,290
Right.
That's not saying that everybody's doing

511
00:25:51,291 --> 00:25:52,520
that,
but I'm aware of.

512
00:25:52,521 --> 00:25:56,330
But you're aware of it.
Certainly there are some,

513
00:25:56,360 --> 00:25:59,570
some things that would eliminate a car 
from your potential.

514
00:25:59,810 --> 00:26:02,210
If you're looking for a truck,
you're not going to buy a prius.

515
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:03,353
Right?
So there's a little bit of common sense 

516
00:26:04,521 --> 00:26:05,354
in there,
but when you get down to those final 

517
00:26:06,711 --> 00:26:07,690
choices,
that's,

518
00:26:07,860 --> 00:26:09,260
that's all.
Just how it feels.

519
00:26:09,530 --> 00:26:10,790
Yeah.
Interesting.

520
00:26:10,840 --> 00:26:12,320
All right.
Should we go to politics?

521
00:26:12,380 --> 00:26:14,780
Sure.
This is where they want us.

522
00:26:14,781 --> 00:26:15,614
This is where all the trump frogs that 
are very excited that I'm talking to 

523
00:26:17,481 --> 00:26:18,310
you.
This is what they want.

524
00:26:18,310 --> 00:26:19,143
Did they fast forward to this?
However they already put on twitter the 

525
00:26:22,270 --> 00:26:23,380
time.
Say Skip.

526
00:26:23,490 --> 00:26:25,680
The first x amount is,
the good stuff is at blah,

527
00:26:25,681 --> 00:26:26,211
blah,
blah.

528
00:26:26,211 --> 00:26:27,200
He had a job.
Okay,

529
00:26:27,201 --> 00:26:28,130
let's get to trump.
All right,

530
00:26:28,131 --> 00:26:29,870
so let's,
let's talk about trump a little bit.

531
00:26:30,140 --> 00:26:34,650
So my sense of your support of trump 
have,

532
00:26:34,790 --> 00:26:39,740
please correct me if I'm wrong,
is not that you love him or his policies

533
00:26:39,741 --> 00:26:40,574
don't always support.
I don't want to go too far with that 

534
00:26:42,870 --> 00:26:43,970
word out there.

535
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:46,770
And you've said some interesting things 
about your support of Hillary.

536
00:26:46,771 --> 00:26:47,890
So,
uh,

537
00:26:47,940 --> 00:26:49,050
yeah,
so correct me if I'm wrong,

538
00:26:49,260 --> 00:26:52,200
that it's not that you're necessarily 
supporting trump,

539
00:26:52,680 --> 00:26:53,513
but you like the techniques or you at 
least understand the techniques that 

540
00:26:57,121 --> 00:26:57,954
he's using to get his message across and
I think they're very much in line with 

541
00:27:01,081 --> 00:27:03,270
some of the techniques that you just 
described to me.

542
00:27:03,300 --> 00:27:06,330
Is that a fair estimation?
And I'll backtrack the word support if

543
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:08,260
put it in my,
uh,

544
00:27:08,310 --> 00:27:09,091
my words.
Yeah.

545
00:27:09,091 --> 00:27:11,880
And put the context straight here.
Um,

546
00:27:12,810 --> 00:27:13,643
I don't think that anybody who was about
seven years old should get hired for a 

547
00:27:17,311 --> 00:27:22,260
job that requires great mental agility,
flexibility,

548
00:27:22,710 --> 00:27:25,620
high energy,
and even staying alive,

549
00:27:25,621 --> 00:27:26,454
which is very important to do the job of
a president if they keep saying he's 

550
00:27:29,011 --> 00:27:30,180
high energy,
be alive.

551
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:32,130
Right?
So,

552
00:27:32,250 --> 00:27:33,083
so it's hard for me to get on board 
either of those choices because really 

553
00:27:35,670 --> 00:27:36,503
320 million people in the United States 
and the best we could get his two 70 

554
00:27:40,441 --> 00:27:43,350
year old racist or biggest,
you know,

555
00:27:43,351 --> 00:27:44,620
depending on which side you're looking 
at it.

556
00:27:44,621 --> 00:27:44,971
Yeah,
we'll,

557
00:27:44,971 --> 00:27:48,000
we'll get into that,
both Megan and secondly,

558
00:27:48,001 --> 00:27:51,930
my political views that don't really 
align closely with either one of them,

559
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:56,040
but that said,
what I noticed last year,

560
00:27:56,041 --> 00:27:56,874
it was trump ahead a,
an influencing or influencers I'm 

561
00:28:02,040 --> 00:28:03,510
toolset.
Um,

562
00:28:03,690 --> 00:28:04,523
he had the skills of the hypnotist and 
the skills of persuasion that I 

563
00:28:09,181 --> 00:28:10,014
immediately said being fairly early on 
last year and said that's not normal 

564
00:28:14,790 --> 00:28:17,640
while he's doing his technique that 
people don't understand,

565
00:28:17,670 --> 00:28:18,503
he's just a better persuader.
And so I'm a big fan of his persuasion 

566
00:28:22,441 --> 00:28:27,270
talents and I think people need to 
understand that in context and maybe not

567
00:28:27,271 --> 00:28:28,104
think of him as the crazy clown.
It was lots of times there's intention 

568
00:28:31,621 --> 00:28:34,650
there and there's a lot of strategy and 
you know,

569
00:28:34,651 --> 00:28:36,420
he's playing the long game and a lot of 
ways.

570
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:37,110
Yeah.

571
00:28:37,110 --> 00:28:39,130
So can you describe that part of it that
uh,

572
00:28:39,140 --> 00:28:40,560
you know,
a lot of people will say,

573
00:28:40,561 --> 00:28:41,394
well,
he's just nuts or he says anything and 

574
00:28:43,051 --> 00:28:43,884
it's just all crazy and all that.
But what you're saying really is that 

575
00:28:46,261 --> 00:28:50,340
there is a method to this madness.
He's not just walking up there every day

576
00:28:50,610 --> 00:28:51,443
and saying crazy things with no plan 
that there's an actual plan and it's 

577
00:28:55,980 --> 00:28:58,130
pulling some of the,
the,

578
00:28:58,350 --> 00:28:58,990
the tools that

579
00:28:58,990 --> 00:29:02,160
you're talking about.
Planning might be overstating it because

580
00:29:02,161 --> 00:29:03,150
who knows you,
you know,

581
00:29:03,151 --> 00:29:03,984
in this kind of context how far in 
advanced they really can plan or how 

582
00:29:07,171 --> 00:29:10,200
much makes sense.
But definitely he is saying,

583
00:29:10,560 --> 00:29:14,520
how can I control the most energy?
Alright,

584
00:29:14,610 --> 00:29:15,443
so persuasion is about making somebody 
focus on your thing until they think 

585
00:29:19,831 --> 00:29:20,664
it's important because the human brain 
is so dumb that it thinks whatever it 

586
00:29:24,601 --> 00:29:29,601
pays attention to the most is the best 
or the worst or the most important.

587
00:29:30,001 --> 00:29:32,610
But anyway,
in their minds it's priority rises right

588
00:29:32,850 --> 00:29:33,683
now,
as long as he doesn't make too many 

589
00:29:35,041 --> 00:29:36,480
things,
people think he's the worst.

590
00:29:36,660 --> 00:29:38,550
The attention alone is a positive,
right?

591
00:29:39,150 --> 00:29:41,870
It's basically the heart of it,
right?

592
00:29:41,890 --> 00:29:42,080
This,

593
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:42,913
that it's an attention game that he's 
using and that's why it was so easy to 

594
00:29:45,641 --> 00:29:47,640
dispatch the secret toolbox.
Yeah.

595
00:29:47,740 --> 00:29:49,630
But if he had to mention one thing to 
sort of,

596
00:29:49,670 --> 00:29:50,503
you know,
shining object and it would be 

597
00:29:51,610 --> 00:29:52,443
manipulating attention,
but he also manipulates attention away 

598
00:29:55,121 --> 00:29:57,100
from things he doesn't want.
So,

599
00:29:57,150 --> 00:29:57,730
um,
I,

600
00:29:57,730 --> 00:29:58,563
my best example is during the first 
debate a year ago when trump was asked 

601
00:30:02,891 --> 00:30:05,290
about his comments about women in the 
past,

602
00:30:05,650 --> 00:30:07,560
now this was a trap that nobody can get 
out of,

603
00:30:07,980 --> 00:30:08,813
right?
You can't say there's nothing you can 

604
00:30:10,121 --> 00:30:15,121
say because now the media has made 
people's attention on these bad things.

605
00:30:15,610 --> 00:30:18,460
So just focusing on it makes them seem 
higher priority.

606
00:30:19,050 --> 00:30:20,320
What does trump say?
He goes,

607
00:30:20,590 --> 00:30:21,423
only rosie o'donnell and suddenly all 
the energy sucked out of the question 

608
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:29,560
and went to this visual,
a person who is disliked,

609
00:30:29,561 --> 00:30:30,580
at least by the base,
you know,

610
00:30:30,581 --> 00:30:33,220
the Republicans could be counted on to 
have an extreme reaction.

611
00:30:33,710 --> 00:30:36,370
So it's a face whenever you can put a 
face to something,

612
00:30:36,730 --> 00:30:41,100
a personality and a visual.
All the energy just sucks into the room.

613
00:30:41,210 --> 00:30:43,240
And that was the moment I got out of my 
chair.

614
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:45,280
So I wait a minute,
this is not normal.

615
00:30:45,700 --> 00:30:48,740
And then I watched to see if he could 
repeat it and he kept doing it and doing

616
00:30:48,760 --> 00:30:51,580
it.
And then by the time he was doing the,

617
00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:52,793
the low energy thing,
I think I was the first person probably 

618
00:30:56,411 --> 00:30:58,210
in the country who said,
okay,

619
00:30:58,211 --> 00:31:02,320
that's not a random insult.
That's the end of Bush is dead.

620
00:31:02,680 --> 00:31:03,513
And there isn't as,
that is what I call linguistic kill 

621
00:31:05,891 --> 00:31:08,860
shots are not just insults.
That's what people thought.

622
00:31:08,890 --> 00:31:10,720
The first part.
These are engineered,

623
00:31:11,090 --> 00:31:12,580
right?
So look at low energy,

624
00:31:12,581 --> 00:31:13,960
how engineered this is,
right?

625
00:31:14,350 --> 00:31:17,500
He takes something that hasn't been used
before in the political realm.

626
00:31:17,560 --> 00:31:18,393
You know,
it's not the usual thing you say in 

627
00:31:19,181 --> 00:31:20,014
politics.
So therefore you can imbue it with his 

628
00:31:21,941 --> 00:31:22,870
own meaning,
right?

629
00:31:22,871 --> 00:31:26,860
It's his own thing.
Then he picks something that matches the

630
00:31:26,861 --> 00:31:30,160
physicality of the person.
That's another big trick or something.

631
00:31:30,161 --> 00:31:32,160
When you look at them and you say,
yeah,

632
00:31:32,260 --> 00:31:33,540
that feels right.
Right.

633
00:31:33,970 --> 00:31:36,250
Now here's the thing.
Before he said that,

634
00:31:36,520 --> 00:31:40,840
before he reframed a Bush as being low 
energy,

635
00:31:41,320 --> 00:31:43,360
I think most people had the same 
impression I did.

636
00:31:43,630 --> 00:31:45,430
I looked at that guy and I said,
you know,

637
00:31:45,431 --> 00:31:47,920
he looks like a calm,
seasoned executive.

638
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:49,073
He,
it looks like he would be unruffled and 

639
00:31:50,350 --> 00:31:51,183
even a nuclear war.
That's exactly the kind of executive I 

640
00:31:53,531 --> 00:31:54,364
was running my country.
And then Bush says low energy and every 

641
00:31:57,431 --> 00:31:58,780
time you look at it and after that you 
go,

642
00:31:59,320 --> 00:32:02,680
well,
it does look a little low energy and you

643
00:32:02,681 --> 00:32:04,060
don't even know why that's bad.

644
00:32:04,060 --> 00:32:05,530
And the edit fields,
so we're in a bad.

645
00:32:06,010 --> 00:32:07,600
So now he's created.
Here's the second,

646
00:32:07,720 --> 00:32:08,440
the,
the other,

647
00:32:08,440 --> 00:32:09,273
the other part that's important.
He creates a trap for confirmation bias 

648
00:32:13,510 --> 00:32:14,343
so that everything that Bush does,
using his normal personality makes you 

649
00:32:18,461 --> 00:32:19,260
think,
oh yeah,

650
00:32:19,260 --> 00:32:21,430
it just.
So his label reinforces over time.

651
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:22,593
Same with Lion Ted Cruz.
Ted Cruz unfortunately has a little bit 

652
00:32:27,461 --> 00:32:29,680
of a distrust,
full face,

653
00:32:31,110 --> 00:32:33,400
kind of slimy.
Some people just have that face,

654
00:32:33,401 --> 00:32:34,180
right?
Yeah.

655
00:32:34,180 --> 00:32:36,910
And because he's a politician and he's 
going to say things that aren't true,

656
00:32:37,390 --> 00:32:38,320
like,
all right,

657
00:32:38,830 --> 00:32:39,663
but he got the tag.
Your confirmation bias will go to 

658
00:32:42,321 --> 00:32:43,850
everything he says.
He's lying,

659
00:32:43,851 --> 00:32:44,684
he's lying.
So is that really the genius of this 

660
00:32:46,521 --> 00:32:47,354
that he said Lion Ted Cruz,
and he calls her crooked hillary when 

661
00:32:50,121 --> 00:32:50,954
there's every evidence to believe that 
someone could call him those things and 

662
00:32:53,931 --> 00:32:54,764
be just as truthful,
if not more truthful than he's being 

663
00:32:57,621 --> 00:32:58,454
right because he's taken every position 
we can talk about some of the 

664
00:33:00,411 --> 00:33:01,244
immigration stuff,
but he's already scaling that back so 

665
00:33:02,671 --> 00:33:03,504
well while it's important to pick the 
one that people are already sort of 

666
00:33:05,630 --> 00:33:06,463
prime to believe or there's something 
about his physicality that would make 

667
00:33:08,991 --> 00:33:11,840
them easily believe that trump.

668
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:13,550
There's a lot of things you can say 
about him,

669
00:33:14,030 --> 00:33:14,863
but what a Clinton has finally jumped on
that was sort of late in the process 

670
00:33:19,191 --> 00:33:21,770
because she was fighting Bernie and that
was a different fight.

671
00:33:22,370 --> 00:33:25,100
But at this point she is going with the,
the racist,

672
00:33:25,130 --> 00:33:26,420
irrational,
racist thing.

673
00:33:26,500 --> 00:33:30,110
Yeah.
And that too is an engineered killshot I

674
00:33:30,111 --> 00:33:30,944
believe I'm reasonably certain that she 
has professionals working for one in 

675
00:33:35,361 --> 00:33:36,194
particular that I've nicknamed Godzilla 
Godzilla is my pet name for Robert 

676
00:33:43,460 --> 00:33:45,720
Cialdini who wrote the book influence,
um,

677
00:33:45,980 --> 00:33:48,830
who would be considered that the monster
of persuasion,

678
00:33:49,190 --> 00:33:52,580
if you are going to hire one person to 
persuade the world.

679
00:33:52,790 --> 00:33:56,540
This is the guy that's the guy.
And apparently he did consult on,

680
00:33:56,980 --> 00:33:58,430
um,
Obama's campaign.

681
00:33:59,050 --> 00:33:59,883
It would be,
it would be surprising if he had not 

682
00:34:01,371 --> 00:34:04,100
been asked at least,
but I don't have confirmation of that.

683
00:34:04,550 --> 00:34:05,383
Um,
but I do know that Clinton went from 

684
00:34:06,831 --> 00:34:11,060
having no persuasion game at all,
talking about facts and their experience

685
00:34:11,061 --> 00:34:14,320
and her policies and realizing that that
wasn't going to work.

686
00:34:14,840 --> 00:34:17,990
And then she went full trump the summer 
and said,

687
00:34:17,991 --> 00:34:20,630
forget about all my facts and policies.
I mean,

688
00:34:20,631 --> 00:34:22,820
she's not forgetting them,
but she's not emphasizing.

689
00:34:23,510 --> 00:34:26,100
You want to be real scared of this Guy 
Kevin here.

690
00:34:26,120 --> 00:34:26,953
And here's the best part.
Trump was using fear as a persuasion 

691
00:34:30,561 --> 00:34:32,360
technique is fears the best thing you 
can do,

692
00:34:32,361 --> 00:34:33,710
right?
You scare people.

693
00:34:33,711 --> 00:34:35,510
They have to,
they have to fix that first.

694
00:34:35,810 --> 00:34:37,910
You fixed your fear first,
then you work at the other stuff.

695
00:34:38,410 --> 00:34:39,530
So he said,
look at these,

696
00:34:39,560 --> 00:34:40,393
these terrorists coming in.
Look at the criminal who's crossing the 

697
00:34:42,081 --> 00:34:42,914
border.
Look at the,

698
00:34:43,180 --> 00:34:44,720
you know,
the economy falling apart.

699
00:34:44,750 --> 00:34:47,690
Now whether or not any that's true 
generates fear.

700
00:34:48,080 --> 00:34:51,440
Fear is real good for persuasion.
That what did,

701
00:34:51,500 --> 00:34:55,220
what did Clinton half facts affects her,
her experience,

702
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:58,160
that's nothing.
And then she ratcheted it up and said,

703
00:34:58,310 --> 00:35:00,830
no,
the real fear is trump,

704
00:35:01,370 --> 00:35:02,060
right?

705
00:35:02,060 --> 00:35:04,870
Because trump is saying maybe you've got
a fear from terrorists,

706
00:35:04,980 --> 00:35:05,813
but if you think about it,
what are the odds that a terrorist is 

707
00:35:07,581 --> 00:35:08,930
going to kill you?
Right?

708
00:35:09,650 --> 00:35:13,700
Low.
So that fear is good fear it worked,

709
00:35:13,880 --> 00:35:16,500
but it's not like a comprehensive fear 
that gets everybody in.

710
00:35:16,501 --> 00:35:17,334
Clinton said,
if trump gets in the office is going to 

711
00:35:19,911 --> 00:35:24,260
have his finger on the nuclear codes and
you're all dead and suddenly she got all

712
00:35:24,261 --> 00:35:27,920
kinds of purchase and you know,
in and her poll numbers started rising.

713
00:35:28,100 --> 00:35:31,010
She basically has a commercial outright 
now saying exactly that.

714
00:35:31,780 --> 00:35:32,600
So.
Right.

715
00:35:32,600 --> 00:35:33,433
So do you think there was a calculated,
what does that say then I guess about 

716
00:35:36,111 --> 00:35:38,010
the Clinton campaign that pretty much

717
00:35:38,010 --> 00:35:38,843
this all went down last week.
Like this all seems to have come to a 

718
00:35:40,711 --> 00:35:43,650
head last week with the big speech 
calling him a racist,

719
00:35:43,910 --> 00:35:44,743
linking him to all right.
And breitbart and we'll get into all 

720
00:35:46,081 --> 00:35:47,370
that.
Um,

721
00:35:47,700 --> 00:35:49,680
do you think there was really a sit down
where they said,

722
00:35:49,681 --> 00:35:50,514
man,
the technique he's using is really 

723
00:35:53,101 --> 00:35:58,101
working and we have to now shift you out
of policy and all that stuff?

724
00:35:58,840 --> 00:36:00,450
Or,
or was it just,

725
00:36:00,690 --> 00:36:02,730
it's sort of low hanging fruit to call 
someone a racist.

726
00:36:02,731 --> 00:36:04,440
They're doing it to each other now.
It's just,

727
00:36:04,500 --> 00:36:05,333
Oh,
you're a racist.

728
00:36:05,830 --> 00:36:06,663
It's become meaningless.
I think for the most part the word has 

729
00:36:08,461 --> 00:36:09,294
become sort of meaningless.
But do you think there was a real 

730
00:36:10,441 --> 00:36:11,274
calculated sit down,
like the technique he's using is 

731
00:36:13,411 --> 00:36:15,240
working.
We better start playing ball this way.

732
00:36:15,420 --> 00:36:16,253
They're both doing what I call the AB 
testing is a word from the technology 

733
00:36:19,861 --> 00:36:20,694
world where you're testing one technique
and then you measure how well it does 

734
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:26,190
and then you test another and if that 
works better,

735
00:36:26,220 --> 00:36:28,020
you go with this one.
If this one works better,

736
00:36:28,021 --> 00:36:31,320
you try yet another one to see if that's
even better until you get the best one.

737
00:36:32,080 --> 00:36:36,030
There is no doubt that they found out 
there are other attacks weren't working.

738
00:36:36,340 --> 00:36:37,173
Um,
I think there was a wiki leaks saying 

739
00:36:38,581 --> 00:36:39,414
that they,
they thought attacking him on his 

740
00:36:40,981 --> 00:36:41,814
business acumen.
Was it working because people sort of 

741
00:36:44,071 --> 00:36:46,890
had it in their mind that,
that he was good at that stuff,

742
00:36:47,310 --> 00:36:48,330
whether that's true or not.

743
00:36:48,360 --> 00:36:49,770
Right.
So I'll show you some bankruptcies,

744
00:36:49,771 --> 00:36:50,640
but they go,
but wait a minute.

745
00:36:50,641 --> 00:36:53,550
He's still his buildings everywhere.
So whether it's true or not.

746
00:36:53,640 --> 00:36:55,220
Yeah.
The trouble with the bankruptcy stories,

747
00:36:55,230 --> 00:36:57,900
who's name is on 500 entities and,
you know,

748
00:36:57,901 --> 00:36:59,610
yeah,
four of them didn't go well.

749
00:36:59,850 --> 00:37:02,280
So that's actually more like a home run 
than a failure,

750
00:37:02,620 --> 00:37:03,130
you know,
in,

751
00:37:03,130 --> 00:37:05,970
in an entrepreneurial sense.
Um,

752
00:37:06,150 --> 00:37:06,983
so yeah,
I think that they tested until they 

753
00:37:08,521 --> 00:37:09,354
found that the racist thing is the one 
that stuck and because of the way he 

754
00:37:13,081 --> 00:37:17,160
talks is unfiltered a method and the 
policies that he's put out,

755
00:37:17,610 --> 00:37:20,560
they attract confirmation bias.
Um,

756
00:37:20,580 --> 00:37:23,520
for those watching who don't know what 
confirmation bias is,

757
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:27,720
it's a well known mental phenomena where
if you think something's true,

758
00:37:28,110 --> 00:37:30,690
you imagine every bit of evidence to 
support that.

759
00:37:31,110 --> 00:37:32,480
Whether it is not,
you'll see,

760
00:37:32,490 --> 00:37:34,980
you'll see it that way.
Once you've decided by the way,

761
00:37:35,030 --> 00:37:37,470
that's,
that's what the hypnotist learns.

762
00:37:37,910 --> 00:37:39,900
The hypnotist learns that once you've 
decided,

763
00:37:39,960 --> 00:37:42,400
which is the irrational decision,
that,

764
00:37:42,510 --> 00:37:43,343
that there is no such thing as data and,
and rational or logic just doesn't 

765
00:37:46,921 --> 00:37:47,290
exist.

766
00:37:47,290 --> 00:37:48,123
That you basically will then just go 
through life finding just the things 

767
00:37:52,691 --> 00:37:55,970
that validate what you have presupposed 
way back.

768
00:37:56,040 --> 00:37:59,640
And let me prove that beyond any doubt,
if ration,

769
00:37:59,700 --> 00:38:04,230
rational thinking and logic existed,
there would only be one religion.

770
00:38:04,990 --> 00:38:05,823
We would all just figured it out.
There would be mostly people all on one 

771
00:38:09,751 --> 00:38:12,180
side and these and these political 
events,

772
00:38:12,450 --> 00:38:14,640
not to every time it's about 50 slash 
50.

773
00:38:14,850 --> 00:38:16,050
Right.
What are the odds of that,

774
00:38:16,070 --> 00:38:16,950
right?
Like,

775
00:38:17,180 --> 00:38:17,761
or,
or,

776
00:38:17,761 --> 00:38:19,290
uh,
I asked the question once,

777
00:38:20,010 --> 00:38:20,843
where do,
where do all the smart people come out 

778
00:38:22,741 --> 00:38:25,800
on this?
Like if you pulled only smart people,

779
00:38:26,160 --> 00:38:27,870
well educated,
really well informed,

780
00:38:27,871 --> 00:38:31,170
smart people,
would they all have the same opinion now

781
00:38:33,180 --> 00:38:34,013
if there was anything to logic and data 
and thinking is thinking we're a real 

782
00:38:37,211 --> 00:38:38,044
thing.
Like we,

783
00:38:38,250 --> 00:38:39,071
you know,
we were really,

784
00:38:39,071 --> 00:38:39,904
you know,
taking the right data and making the 

785
00:38:41,051 --> 00:38:41,884
right decisions.
People would mostly be on the same side 

786
00:38:45,281 --> 00:38:47,200
and these political questions,
you know,

787
00:38:47,201 --> 00:38:48,790
even if it's 75,
25,

788
00:38:48,791 --> 00:38:50,740
it would be overwhelmingly,
you know,

789
00:38:50,741 --> 00:38:52,010
on one side,
but they're not.

790
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:56,470
So as someone that cares about thinking 
and critical thought and being smart and

791
00:38:56,710 --> 00:38:57,543
all of that stuff,
this has to be a little depressing for 

792
00:39:00,071 --> 00:39:00,700
you.
Right?

793
00:39:00,700 --> 00:39:01,720
I mean,
as you already said,

794
00:39:01,721 --> 00:39:04,960
the 70 year old part and all that.
And we've only selected just these two,

795
00:39:04,961 --> 00:39:08,920
but just the general discourse has to be
kind of depressing,

796
00:39:08,921 --> 00:39:11,080
right?
Absolutely not because remember,

797
00:39:11,081 --> 00:39:12,040
since,
um,

798
00:39:12,100 --> 00:39:14,410
since my twenties when I learned 
hypnosis,

799
00:39:14,860 --> 00:39:18,040
I've abandoned the idea that anyone is 
rational,

800
00:39:18,041 --> 00:39:20,860
including me.
So once you abandoned that,

801
00:39:20,861 --> 00:39:23,890
the world becomes far less frustrating,
not more so.

802
00:39:23,891 --> 00:39:25,950
Let's look at the world that the rest of
you are living in.

803
00:39:26,410 --> 00:39:28,410
And I feel sorry for your bachelors 
living,

804
00:39:28,420 --> 00:39:29,253
living in this world because if you're 
looking at the people who are on the 

805
00:39:32,081 --> 00:39:33,850
other side of a political debate and 
you're saying,

806
00:39:34,210 --> 00:39:38,890
why can't they see the logic,
the rational arguments that are so clear

807
00:39:38,891 --> 00:39:39,550
to me?

808
00:39:39,550 --> 00:39:42,040
And the answer is always the same.
You're an idiot.

809
00:39:43,540 --> 00:39:45,700
But guess what they're thinking they are
too.

810
00:39:46,170 --> 00:39:47,003
And you know,
they're having exactly the same thought 

811
00:39:48,431 --> 00:39:52,240
where their set of confirmation bias and
they're so sure that they're right.

812
00:39:52,590 --> 00:39:55,630
Sure.
So basically you're saying you,

813
00:39:56,050 --> 00:39:58,600
Scott Adams don't have any of the 
answers,

814
00:39:58,601 --> 00:40:00,970
right?
But you're just saying this is,

815
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:01,833
this is the game.
So we have to deal with it in that 

816
00:40:03,401 --> 00:40:05,590
reality.
While I have all the answers,

817
00:40:05,591 --> 00:40:06,424
if you're talking about the political 
stuff you've got all the way and we 

818
00:40:08,231 --> 00:40:09,640
haven't gotten to that yet.
Yeah.

819
00:40:09,730 --> 00:40:10,980
Well let's get to.
Let's go.

820
00:40:10,990 --> 00:40:12,610
You wait,
before we get to all the answers.

821
00:40:12,611 --> 00:40:15,610
That will be a better thing to probably 
end with all the answers to everything.

822
00:40:15,700 --> 00:40:16,533
Maybe we'll wrap up the show.
I could end the show if we get all the 

823
00:40:18,611 --> 00:40:19,530
answers.
Yeah,

824
00:40:19,660 --> 00:40:20,620
we'll,
we'll see.

825
00:40:20,750 --> 00:40:21,640
Uh,
but I'm curious.

826
00:40:21,700 --> 00:40:24,640
So the racist word,
we've talked about it a lot on this show

827
00:40:24,641 --> 00:40:25,474
that one of my issues has been how the 
left has used the words of bigotry and 

828
00:40:29,410 --> 00:40:31,960
racism and homophobia and all of these 
things.

829
00:40:32,110 --> 00:40:32,943
They've used them so much to smear their
opponents that these words have no 

830
00:40:35,441 --> 00:40:36,880
longer have any meaning.
Really?

831
00:40:36,910 --> 00:40:38,290
Totally disagree.
Really?

832
00:40:38,410 --> 00:40:39,243
Yeah.
Racist never loses its power even now 

833
00:40:41,921 --> 00:40:42,754
because my feeling was absolutely need 
both were firing at each other and it 

834
00:40:45,611 --> 00:40:48,250
didn't feel like it took anymore.
Oh No,

835
00:40:48,251 --> 00:40:50,020
it's taken.
It's taken big time.

836
00:40:50,710 --> 00:40:51,543
Yeah.
If if you talk to the average Clinton 

837
00:40:54,401 --> 00:40:56,590
supporter about what they think of 
trump,

838
00:40:56,890 --> 00:41:00,340
and this is something I've not seen in 
any other election,

839
00:41:00,790 --> 00:41:04,690
you'll see the person who dislikes trump
physically shake.

840
00:41:04,780 --> 00:41:05,613
Yeah.
I've seen people talk about them and 

841
00:41:07,080 --> 00:41:09,400
their handshake,
like there's a lot of people.

842
00:41:09,401 --> 00:41:10,234
I mean this is not just a few.
Observation is common that people will 

843
00:41:13,361 --> 00:41:17,800
spit and yell and shake and that's 
because the racist claim sticks.

844
00:41:18,150 --> 00:41:21,100
It's not because they think his policies
aren't as good.

845
00:41:21,430 --> 00:41:26,380
They prefer this approach has nothing to
do that they think is actually a racist.

846
00:41:26,620 --> 00:41:27,453
They've literally been convinced,
and so that's that subset of Clinton 

847
00:41:30,191 --> 00:41:31,024
supporters.
My suspicion though is that the average 

848
00:41:33,651 --> 00:41:34,130
person

849
00:41:34,130 --> 00:41:35,900
out there,
here's the word racist,

850
00:41:35,901 --> 00:41:36,734
sees the way these things have been 
overused and the way we label everybody 

851
00:41:39,260 --> 00:41:40,093
and goes it actually in a way,
especially if you take the trump 

852
00:41:43,761 --> 00:41:45,980
supporters,
every time you call them a racist,

853
00:41:45,981 --> 00:41:46,814
it actually,
they like it because they feel like 

854
00:41:48,171 --> 00:41:49,004
you've lost the argument,
so that's the word you're throwing out 

855
00:41:50,601 --> 00:41:51,434
there.

856
00:41:51,630 --> 00:41:55,140
There's confirmation bias in in 
inaction.

857
00:41:56,150 --> 00:41:56,983
Oh,
I guess that's the best example of 

858
00:41:58,130 --> 00:41:59,380
someone calls you something bad and you 
go.

859
00:41:59,580 --> 00:42:00,413
So the,
the trump supporters believe is that 

860
00:42:02,350 --> 00:42:04,830
they're not racist or you know,
it's not a problem.

861
00:42:05,190 --> 00:42:06,023
And so they,
they imagined the world in which those 

862
00:42:08,010 --> 00:42:11,310
insults or ineffective,
but they are totally effective.

863
00:42:11,380 --> 00:42:12,213
It's,
it's the strongest sauce you could 

864
00:42:13,321 --> 00:42:18,321
possibly put on this spaghetti.
Terrible analogy that was there.

865
00:42:20,130 --> 00:42:21,260
Uh,
yeah.

866
00:42:21,270 --> 00:42:22,103
So that's the reason Clinton's using it 
and I'm sure they've tested everything 

867
00:42:24,391 --> 00:42:25,380
else and found out,
wow,

868
00:42:25,381 --> 00:42:26,214
this is super,
but let me get back to the confirmation 

869
00:42:29,041 --> 00:42:31,370
bias.
So look at the charge and look at all of

870
00:42:31,371 --> 00:42:35,850
the things that trump is accused of and 
we'll just pick anyone and of the bunch.

871
00:42:36,180 --> 00:42:41,180
Let's take the judge curial a thing 
where he said that the judge couldn't be

872
00:42:41,221 --> 00:42:43,340
bias because in,
um,

873
00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:46,320
in trump's words he was Mexican.
Now you hear that.

874
00:42:46,330 --> 00:42:47,910
And even to my ears,
that's like,

875
00:42:48,660 --> 00:42:49,650
the judge would be biased.

876
00:42:49,650 --> 00:42:50,700
That couldn't be biased.
Right,

877
00:42:50,701 --> 00:42:51,211
right,
right.

878
00:42:51,211 --> 00:42:52,044
Okay.
Um,

879
00:42:52,200 --> 00:42:53,850
so even to my ears that's like,
oh,

880
00:42:53,920 --> 00:42:56,940
that's like a little red flag there.
So you back it up.

881
00:42:57,000 --> 00:43:00,840
If you talk to someone who was born in 
this country and their parents came from

882
00:43:00,841 --> 00:43:01,674
Mexico,
what do they call themselves while 

883
00:43:03,421 --> 00:43:04,254
they're Americans?
Obviously they call themselves 

884
00:43:05,131 --> 00:43:07,680
Americans,
but in casual conversation they'd say,

885
00:43:07,681 --> 00:43:09,510
I'm Mexican.
Same Way.

886
00:43:09,511 --> 00:43:12,540
If you're a Italian blood,
but you,

887
00:43:12,560 --> 00:43:16,860
you're two generations away from Italy,
people still say,

888
00:43:16,861 --> 00:43:17,700
yeah,
I'm Italian.

889
00:43:18,180 --> 00:43:19,980
It's an understood.
You're also American.

890
00:43:20,250 --> 00:43:21,083
It was.
We just have.

891
00:43:21,320 --> 00:43:22,153
So he used me.
He used the language the way people use 

892
00:43:23,791 --> 00:43:24,770
language,
right?

893
00:43:24,780 --> 00:43:26,580
So,
so far he's not a racist.

894
00:43:26,581 --> 00:43:28,170
He just used the language,
lay people do.

895
00:43:28,440 --> 00:43:30,810
But he went further.
He said that because of that,

896
00:43:31,200 --> 00:43:34,050
you would be biased.
Now you know who's biased.

897
00:43:34,920 --> 00:43:38,610
Every fucking person,
every person in the world is bias.

898
00:43:38,740 --> 00:43:40,770
There's no such thing as the unbiased 
person.

899
00:43:41,100 --> 00:43:43,640
There's a reason that,
that jury's pick,

900
00:43:43,641 --> 00:43:44,400
um,
that,

901
00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:45,233
uh,
lawyers kick people off of Jerry's 

902
00:43:46,740 --> 00:43:48,780
because of their experience that is 
biased.

903
00:43:48,990 --> 00:43:49,823
There's a reason that a judge can recuse
himself or herself because they know 

904
00:43:53,041 --> 00:43:56,670
they're biased.
So to imagine that someone who has,

905
00:43:56,671 --> 00:44:00,900
let's say a Mexican heritage and 
presumably their relatives are Mexican,

906
00:44:00,901 --> 00:44:03,060
maybe he has,
maybe he's visited Mexico,

907
00:44:03,061 --> 00:44:03,894
I don't know if that's true,
but at the very least he's got a family 

908
00:44:06,061 --> 00:44:06,894
influence.
What is more influential on your 

909
00:44:09,091 --> 00:44:09,924
decision making than your family and how
you have to live with them for the rest 

910
00:44:13,741 --> 00:44:14,574
of your life?
Imagine this judge ruling inexplicably 

911
00:44:17,551 --> 00:44:22,530
favorably for trump and then attending 
this next family reunion right now.

912
00:44:22,531 --> 00:44:24,900
Remove Mexican.
It doesn't matter who it is.

913
00:44:24,901 --> 00:44:25,734
If this guy is,
if this guy does something that's 

914
00:44:27,061 --> 00:44:29,850
unpopular with his family,
that's the problem.

915
00:44:30,090 --> 00:44:34,560
That's the perfect for a human.
Forget that is a judge.

916
00:44:34,561 --> 00:44:36,780
Forget deals,
heritage and human.

917
00:44:36,840 --> 00:44:40,170
In that situation,
it was almost guaranteed to be biased.

918
00:44:40,560 --> 00:44:43,020
Now the question is,
is a professional judge,

919
00:44:43,410 --> 00:44:45,120
can he see past that?
That's his job,

920
00:44:45,140 --> 00:44:46,770
right?
Of course,

921
00:44:47,160 --> 00:44:47,993
right?
But it's still smart for trump to put 

922
00:44:49,951 --> 00:44:54,951
that out there because he's persuading a
legal case and both,

923
00:44:55,500 --> 00:44:57,660
both sides are trying to persuade as 
hard as they can.

924
00:44:57,960 --> 00:44:59,430
So trump is putting it out there and 
says,

925
00:44:59,431 --> 00:45:00,300
hey,
you know,

926
00:45:00,301 --> 00:45:02,250
and he's also persuading the public in 
advance.

927
00:45:02,490 --> 00:45:03,323
If I get a bad judgment,
I'm going to say people in this 

928
00:45:06,361 --> 00:45:09,810
situation can be biased.
If I get a good judgment,

929
00:45:09,900 --> 00:45:14,340
I'm happy I go away.
So as he's not doing it as subtly as you

930
00:45:14,341 --> 00:45:15,210
just laid out saying,
well,

931
00:45:15,211 --> 00:45:19,350
this guy might be biased in a calm way.
You calmly laid it out.

932
00:45:19,350 --> 00:45:20,890
He,
he goes to the easier but that.

933
00:45:20,910 --> 00:45:23,080
But you're saying that's the whole,
that's why he gets attached point.

934
00:45:23,130 --> 00:45:24,330
Yeah.
He gets attention.

935
00:45:24,331 --> 00:45:26,130
So it's the attention on it that makes 
it powerful.

936
00:45:26,970 --> 00:45:27,803
So if you were to pick this apart as the
legal strategy and pick the actual 

937
00:45:30,451 --> 00:45:32,460
words,
there actually isn't any racism.

938
00:45:32,461 --> 00:45:36,330
There is a comment about somebody who 
has a race in this case,

939
00:45:36,950 --> 00:45:38,060
uh,
has a,

940
00:45:38,290 --> 00:45:39,123
a cultural heritage is a better word,
but everybody is influenced by all 

941
00:45:44,250 --> 00:45:46,320
their,
all of their influences.

942
00:45:47,100 --> 00:45:49,620
Family influences their job.
They worked at their pack,

943
00:45:50,010 --> 00:45:51,150
their background,
all of that.

944
00:45:51,300 --> 00:45:52,133
Right.
I suppose the inherent problem with it 

945
00:45:54,091 --> 00:45:54,924
in that case is that had the,
had this judge been white of Irish 

946
00:45:58,441 --> 00:46:02,520
descent or Italian descent or some other
European descent,

947
00:46:03,300 --> 00:46:05,790
you acknowledged she would have certain 
biases,

948
00:46:05,791 --> 00:46:10,791
but trump would've never figured out a 
way to bring up his ethnic background.

949
00:46:11,880 --> 00:46:15,450
I'm going to.
Let me give you an example right back to

950
00:46:15,451 --> 00:46:16,284
your.
Let's say trump is doing some business 

951
00:46:17,911 --> 00:46:19,320
in Scotland,
which he is.

952
00:46:19,710 --> 00:46:24,360
Let's say the people in Scotland got 
really mad at him and formed a partition

953
00:46:24,361 --> 00:46:26,460
and the people in Scotland just hated 
him.

954
00:46:26,520 --> 00:46:27,353
Yeah,
I think they're doing this over that 

955
00:46:27,931 --> 00:46:28,800
golf course.
All right,

956
00:46:29,430 --> 00:46:31,230
so let's say there was a,
a,

957
00:46:31,540 --> 00:46:35,220
you know,
a second generation Scottish judge.

958
00:46:36,030 --> 00:46:38,200
I think even trump has some Scottish 
blood.

959
00:46:38,250 --> 00:46:38,970
Yeah,
I think so.

960
00:46:38,970 --> 00:46:42,960
So in that case,
if a Scottish judge who had Scottish,

961
00:46:43,910 --> 00:46:44,743
uh,
parents was involved and he knew that 

962
00:46:47,370 --> 00:46:49,530
the Scottish parents living in Scotland 
were really,

963
00:46:49,531 --> 00:46:51,120
really mad at trump.
Yeah.

964
00:46:51,210 --> 00:46:52,043
Would it be fair to say that the 
Scottish judge who was really an 

965
00:46:54,511 --> 00:46:56,670
American citizen with Scottish 
background,

966
00:46:57,190 --> 00:46:58,590
um,
could be biased?

967
00:46:58,800 --> 00:47:00,450
I think so.
I mean,

968
00:47:00,451 --> 00:47:02,280
wouldn't you know reasonable?

969
00:47:02,430 --> 00:47:04,140
Yeah.
So basically you're just.

970
00:47:04,200 --> 00:47:06,270
All you're doing really is just peeling 
back the.

971
00:47:06,271 --> 00:47:08,400
You're showing the wizard behind the 
curtain here,

972
00:47:08,520 --> 00:47:10,470
so more than anything else,
right?

973
00:47:10,471 --> 00:47:11,304
You're not.
You're not defending the specifics of 

974
00:47:13,891 --> 00:47:14,940
what he's doing.
Oh No.

975
00:47:14,990 --> 00:47:15,823
This in this case,
what I'm doing is giving the listeners 

976
00:47:18,451 --> 00:47:20,880
an example of what confirmation bias 
looks like.

977
00:47:21,600 --> 00:47:26,040
When you heard the judge curial comment 
out of context.

978
00:47:26,370 --> 00:47:31,180
It does sound like a racist statement.
Once you put it in its proper context,

979
00:47:31,181 --> 00:47:34,180
that goes away and that's how 
confirmation bias looks.

980
00:47:34,240 --> 00:47:35,430
It looks just like that.
Yeah.

981
00:47:35,890 --> 00:47:38,160
Do you blame?
Why don't.

982
00:47:38,190 --> 00:47:39,820
Since you have a lot of blame in 
general,

983
00:47:39,821 --> 00:47:40,654
but do you prescribe the symptom of 
trump to just everything that has 

984
00:47:46,901 --> 00:47:47,734
transpired over the last 20 years just 
are terrible media that doesn't 

985
00:47:51,701 --> 00:47:52,534
challenge politicians are discourse 
that's crumbled to the point of just 

986
00:47:56,081 --> 00:47:58,780
yelling racism at everybody are 
politicians who lie.

987
00:47:58,990 --> 00:48:01,450
I don't think trump is any bigger,
bigger of a liar.

988
00:48:01,451 --> 00:48:03,640
Then Hillary is.
I think she's probably a bigger liar.

989
00:48:03,641 --> 00:48:05,940
Everything being equal,
but he lies in more of a,

990
00:48:06,120 --> 00:48:09,250
in a more of a regular person way.
And that makes people freak out.

991
00:48:09,370 --> 00:48:10,203
She lies in more of a policy,
like it just all led up to him in a way 

992
00:48:13,181 --> 00:48:14,350
it seems kind of obvious.

993
00:48:14,540 --> 00:48:15,540
Well,
you know,

994
00:48:15,590 --> 00:48:18,020
we don't live in a single variable 
world,

995
00:48:18,021 --> 00:48:20,180
so you needed everything to be the way 
it is.

996
00:48:20,540 --> 00:48:22,630
Plus trump and again,
the results you have,

997
00:48:22,631 --> 00:48:23,464
you can't,
he can't remove one of the important 

998
00:48:24,501 --> 00:48:25,760
variables.
And there were lots of them.

999
00:48:26,150 --> 00:48:28,880
But I think the key variable,
and this is what I've been saying,

1000
00:48:28,910 --> 00:48:32,270
is trump's skill,
his skill at persuasion,

1001
00:48:33,200 --> 00:48:34,033
that is the story.
I don't think you could take a non 

1002
00:48:35,961 --> 00:48:36,794
trump,
put them in this same world in 2016 and 

1003
00:48:39,291 --> 00:48:41,930
say the world is crazy in the media,
is this,

1004
00:48:42,400 --> 00:48:43,233
um,
I don't think you could drop Kanye West 

1005
00:48:45,801 --> 00:48:46,634
into there yet,
although I've said he does have some 

1006
00:48:47,900 --> 00:48:48,733
really high persuasion skills,
but he doesn't have some of the other 

1007
00:48:50,751 --> 00:48:52,130
stuff.
Um,

1008
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:55,220
so yeah,
I think trump's specific phenomenon.

1009
00:48:55,590 --> 00:48:56,880
Yeah.
So.

1010
00:48:57,480 --> 00:49:00,030
Alright.
So I don't sense full trump's support.

1011
00:49:00,120 --> 00:49:02,050
Correct?
Or is that what you're not,

1012
00:49:02,160 --> 00:49:03,280
you have support,
you know,

1013
00:49:03,290 --> 00:49:05,840
I would never,
I never support the use of support

1014
00:49:05,930 --> 00:49:09,230
in terms of.
And yet at the same time,

1015
00:49:09,650 --> 00:49:12,470
I think a lot of people think you're 
like one of the biggest trump supporters

1016
00:49:12,471 --> 00:49:16,280
out there and it's really just because 
you're talking about his technique.

1017
00:49:16,560 --> 00:49:18,850
Uh,
I'm an admirer of his technique.

1018
00:49:18,851 --> 00:49:20,230
Yeah.
I,

1019
00:49:20,231 --> 00:49:21,064
unlike many people,
I'm very amused by his humor and his 

1020
00:49:24,221 --> 00:49:25,330
personality.
And by the way,

1021
00:49:25,331 --> 00:49:26,164
before we were filming,
you mentioned you have a New York 

1022
00:49:28,301 --> 00:49:30,700
background as do I from upstate New 
York.

1023
00:49:31,150 --> 00:49:33,760
And I haven't talked to too many New 
York people about this.

1024
00:49:33,761 --> 00:49:34,600
I'm going to run this by you.

1025
00:49:35,260 --> 00:49:38,460
I went to Suny Binghamton badly.
That was another piece of my news.

1026
00:49:38,550 --> 00:49:39,940
Hartwick.
Is that right?

1027
00:49:40,420 --> 00:49:42,270
Oh my God,
we're practically neighbors.

1028
00:49:42,271 --> 00:49:43,300
There you go.
The wrong times.

1029
00:49:43,810 --> 00:49:46,000
Um,
what was I talking about?

1030
00:49:46,340 --> 00:49:47,650
Upstate New York?
Upstate New York.

1031
00:49:48,310 --> 00:49:51,910
So when trump talks in these ways that 
offend the world,

1032
00:49:52,720 --> 00:49:55,790
I as a New Yorker say,
that's not offensive talk.

1033
00:49:55,820 --> 00:49:57,350
Let's just talk.
Yeah,

1034
00:49:58,800 --> 00:50:00,970
that's just how I talked.
One of the,

1035
00:50:00,971 --> 00:50:01,804
um,
one of the things I had to learn to 

1036
00:50:03,071 --> 00:50:03,904
change when I moved to California is 
that when I talked like New York people 

1037
00:50:08,081 --> 00:50:10,410
talk upstate or city,
it's,

1038
00:50:10,600 --> 00:50:14,770
there's a bluntness that is offensive 
and I had to really work on that.

1039
00:50:14,800 --> 00:50:15,633
Also,
there's an arrogance or a perceived 

1040
00:50:18,251 --> 00:50:22,600
arrogance of New Yorkers because we talk
honestly about things we're good at.

1041
00:50:23,500 --> 00:50:25,960
We also talk honestly about the things 
we're bad at,

1042
00:50:26,020 --> 00:50:28,210
but that Kinda gets lost California.
Right?

1043
00:50:28,260 --> 00:50:29,050
And I was like,
Oh,

1044
00:50:29,050 --> 00:50:30,630
you have a big ego.
No,

1045
00:50:30,650 --> 00:50:31,640
I said,
I'm good at these things.

1046
00:50:31,660 --> 00:50:35,180
I'm just like,
you just like everybody.

1047
00:50:35,180 --> 00:50:36,770
We're all good at something.
We're bad at something.

1048
00:50:37,040 --> 00:50:38,510
How was that?
How was that terrible?

1049
00:50:39,410 --> 00:50:41,240
But the things that New Yorkers do is 
they say,

1050
00:50:41,570 --> 00:50:42,700
man,
I want to punch that guy.

1051
00:50:42,750 --> 00:50:43,583
He knows he needs a,
he needs two bullets in the back of the 

1052
00:50:45,381 --> 00:50:45,980
head,
you know,

1053
00:50:45,980 --> 00:50:46,813
I'll give him two in the chest.
One on one of the head is just normal 

1054
00:50:49,401 --> 00:50:50,500
New York talk.
Yeah.

1055
00:50:50,600 --> 00:50:53,120
But you see that and a context.
And by the way,

1056
00:50:53,180 --> 00:50:57,510
I think this is purely a trump mistake,
meaning that there's,

1057
00:50:58,100 --> 00:50:59,480
I don't think there's somebody telling 
them,

1058
00:51:00,050 --> 00:51:01,670
wait,
this stuff doesn't sound the same.

1059
00:51:01,780 --> 00:51:04,070
And as soon as you leave the street,
as soon as you leave,

1060
00:51:04,071 --> 00:51:06,080
your state really doesn't sound the 
same.

1061
00:51:06,270 --> 00:51:07,103
Yeah.
It's funny because I was just telling 

1062
00:51:07,801 --> 00:51:10,290
you I was.
I visited New York for the last 10 days.

1063
00:51:10,291 --> 00:51:13,470
I got back yesterday and even though I 
lived there my whole life,

1064
00:51:13,471 --> 00:51:14,304
one of the things that I really noticed 
about being in New York City for for 10 

1065
00:51:17,281 --> 00:51:19,440
days was the incredible,
you know,

1066
00:51:19,470 --> 00:51:23,310
racial mix and every,
every type of person on earth is in that

1067
00:51:23,311 --> 00:51:25,410
city,
on subways together.

1068
00:51:25,411 --> 00:51:26,244
We're not killing each other.
We're pretty much just ignoring each 

1069
00:51:28,801 --> 00:51:31,320
other because everyone's going to live 
their lives.

1070
00:51:31,500 --> 00:51:34,200
And I thought there's something actually
beautiful about that.

1071
00:51:34,380 --> 00:51:35,213
It doesn't matter ultimately if keep 
these people privately hate each other 

1072
00:51:38,491 --> 00:51:39,324
for racist reasons or anything,
but they're all out there living their 

1073
00:51:43,411 --> 00:51:44,244
lives.
That's not to say there isn't any crime 

1074
00:51:45,211 --> 00:51:47,850
or any bad racism or something like 
that.

1075
00:51:48,060 --> 00:51:51,240
But I thought that was actually 
inspiring about New York that we're told

1076
00:51:51,241 --> 00:51:53,820
we live in this society that's so frayed
and everything,

1077
00:51:53,821 --> 00:51:56,070
and yet our best city has everybody

1078
00:51:56,300 --> 00:51:58,430
and we're doing that.
I love that example.

1079
00:51:58,431 --> 00:51:59,970
And to that point,
um,

1080
00:52:00,070 --> 00:52:03,230
I'm going to steal something that I 
heard Dr Laura say one,

1081
00:52:03,240 --> 00:52:04,520
so I'm kind of,
you know,

1082
00:52:04,660 --> 00:52:05,493
maybe modifying the words a little bit,
but I'll credit her for the thought and 

1083
00:52:08,301 --> 00:52:09,134
the thought is that you are what you do.
You're not what you think because if we 

1084
00:52:14,271 --> 00:52:17,800
were judged by our thoughts,
we would all be executed for,

1085
00:52:18,560 --> 00:52:20,330
you know,
you should be killed for just the things

1086
00:52:20,331 --> 00:52:21,240
you were thinking,
right?

1087
00:52:21,450 --> 00:52:22,570
Um,
that's coming.

1088
00:52:23,320 --> 00:52:24,590
Yeah.
You are what you do.

1089
00:52:24,591 --> 00:52:27,230
And more importantly,
you are what you do recently.

1090
00:52:27,590 --> 00:52:31,430
Because if I'm judged by my past,
I got some problems.

1091
00:52:31,850 --> 00:52:34,000
If you're judged by your past,
you've probably got some problems too.

1092
00:52:34,020 --> 00:52:35,330
We were all in their twenties.
Ones,

1093
00:52:35,410 --> 00:52:36,500
right?
It's all,

1094
00:52:36,501 --> 00:52:38,340
it's all bad stuff in the past.
Yeah.

1095
00:52:38,480 --> 00:52:41,450
The goal of life is to improve.
So if we're not,

1096
00:52:41,560 --> 00:52:43,370
if we're not improving,
we've got a problem,

1097
00:52:43,371 --> 00:52:44,204
right?
I think both Clinton and trump have 

1098
00:52:46,311 --> 00:52:49,250
probably improved and I think that 
judging them,

1099
00:52:49,340 --> 00:52:50,173
either one of them by something that 
happened in say 10 or more years ago is 

1100
00:52:53,900 --> 00:52:54,733
um,
is probably a bad bet because we're all 

1101
00:52:57,951 --> 00:52:58,784
bad people 10 years ago compared to how 
we are now because ideally we're all 

1102
00:53:02,691 --> 00:53:03,630
getting better,
smarter,

1103
00:53:03,700 --> 00:53:04,600
right?
Better informed.

1104
00:53:04,720 --> 00:53:07,240
Well the hope is by the law,
but people do obviously,

1105
00:53:07,241 --> 00:53:08,074
but the other way too to

1106
00:53:08,160 --> 00:53:11,010
so when people are judging,
for example of trump for his,

1107
00:53:11,040 --> 00:53:11,873
let's say his,
his recent focus on African Americans 

1108
00:53:17,010 --> 00:53:20,340
and say that's in his mind.
He's not thinking that.

1109
00:53:21,030 --> 00:53:22,980
I say,
you're on the wrong page.

1110
00:53:23,260 --> 00:53:24,093
What,
what,

1111
00:53:24,270 --> 00:53:25,103
what counts is what he's doing and what 
he was doing before it wasn't as good 

1112
00:53:28,770 --> 00:53:30,120
because he wasn't mentioning,
you know,

1113
00:53:30,121 --> 00:53:30,954
other groups in society and now he is.
So he's gone from less good too good if 

1114
00:53:35,311 --> 00:53:37,560
doing the right thing doesn't count 
anymore,

1115
00:53:38,100 --> 00:53:38,970
what the fuck.

1116
00:53:40,050 --> 00:53:41,570
So that,
that's really fascinating.

1117
00:53:41,571 --> 00:53:42,404
So when they,
when they take something like the 

1118
00:53:43,461 --> 00:53:45,830
immigration thing where he said we're 
going to kick them all out day one,

1119
00:53:46,100 --> 00:53:46,933
then he tempered it this past week and 
then it sounds like he untempered it by 

1120
00:53:49,821 --> 00:53:50,301
saying,
you know,

1121
00:53:50,301 --> 00:53:52,160
first our in office,
it's going to start or something.

1122
00:53:52,310 --> 00:53:55,190
Those are all crazy comments,
like we're not getting rid of everybody.

1123
00:53:55,520 --> 00:53:58,940
Then the temporary actually I thought it
sounded somewhat sane and then I'm going

1124
00:53:58,941 --> 00:54:01,850
to do it in the first hour.
Sounds completely insane at that point.

1125
00:54:01,851 --> 00:54:03,950
Is there.
That's not crazy at all.

1126
00:54:04,080 --> 00:54:05,380
No,
no.

1127
00:54:05,390 --> 00:54:06,223
I get it.
He's using the tools you're talking 

1128
00:54:07,851 --> 00:54:10,070
about but is there.
So I understand that,

1129
00:54:10,280 --> 00:54:11,113
but is there anything that he could say,
do you think that would turn off his 

1130
00:54:15,081 --> 00:54:19,880
people because he immigration was their 
number one thing and he pretty much.

1131
00:54:19,881 --> 00:54:21,650
I mean even Ann Coulter was 
acknowledging it.

1132
00:54:21,890 --> 00:54:24,590
Like he backed off that because he was 
trying,

1133
00:54:24,770 --> 00:54:28,340
I think to become better,
to become a more legitimate candidate.

1134
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:30,680
Yeah.
So he had to throw them under the bus.

1135
00:54:32,060 --> 00:54:33,950
Well,
people who believed it,

1136
00:54:34,040 --> 00:54:35,750
I would.
I would put it in these terms.

1137
00:54:35,780 --> 00:54:36,613
In hypnosis,
there's something called pacing and 

1138
00:54:38,451 --> 00:54:41,750
leading.
Pacing is when you match your subject in

1139
00:54:41,751 --> 00:54:44,690
any way you match their breathing,
the way they talked,

1140
00:54:45,110 --> 00:54:48,620
the way their their posture,
because if you do that long enough,

1141
00:54:48,650 --> 00:54:51,830
people get comfortable with you and then
you can do what's called leading,

1142
00:54:52,280 --> 00:54:53,113
so then you then you can do something 
different and then people will start 

1143
00:54:56,541 --> 00:54:57,374
doing the thing that you're doing,
so you start by copying them until they 

1144
00:55:00,681 --> 00:55:02,690
learn to copy you.
Subconsciously.

1145
00:55:02,720 --> 00:55:04,290
They're not doing it intentionally.
It's a.

1146
00:55:04,470 --> 00:55:05,303
it's a major.
It's one of the biggest components of 

1147
00:55:07,341 --> 00:55:08,174
hypnosis is that idea.
What trump is doing is pacing and 

1148
00:55:11,241 --> 00:55:12,074
leading the entire Republican Party.
What you think he's doing is that he's 

1149
00:55:16,310 --> 00:55:19,580
gone in and his ideas are a little 
different and somehow with his,

1150
00:55:19,610 --> 00:55:21,350
you know,
he's punched his way through the top.

1151
00:55:21,950 --> 00:55:26,270
That is not what he's doing.
He hollowed out the gop and he's wearing

1152
00:55:26,271 --> 00:55:29,810
it as a skin.
When he's done,

1153
00:55:30,110 --> 00:55:32,180
the Republican Party will never be the 
same.

1154
00:55:32,470 --> 00:55:34,970
He has changed it and he has improved 
it.

1155
00:55:35,360 --> 00:55:36,193
He got in front of,
he got onstage at the Republican 

1156
00:55:38,871 --> 00:55:39,704
convention and did a full throated what 
I thought was completely sincere 

1157
00:55:43,940 --> 00:55:48,410
endorsement of doing more to help the 
Lbgtq community.

1158
00:55:48,980 --> 00:55:49,813
Peter Teal spoke.
He meant it and what happened with all 

1159
00:55:53,721 --> 00:55:56,750
the Republicans as soon as.
As soon as he did that,

1160
00:55:57,410 --> 00:55:59,420
you don't hear anybody complaining about
that,

1161
00:55:59,421 --> 00:56:00,150
right?
Yeah,

1162
00:56:00,150 --> 00:56:01,730
and not that they would have complained 
necessarily,

1163
00:56:01,970 --> 00:56:02,803
but the Republican party changed.
Trump changed them and they can't go 

1164
00:56:06,921 --> 00:56:07,754
back.
He,

1165
00:56:07,820 --> 00:56:11,030
he pays them until he led them and on 
immigration.

1166
00:56:11,300 --> 00:56:12,133
He pays them.
He said what they needed to hear until 

1167
00:56:14,001 --> 00:56:15,170
they said,
trump,

1168
00:56:15,171 --> 00:56:15,860
trump,
trump.

1169
00:56:15,860 --> 00:56:17,570
He's our guy.
I feel good with you.

1170
00:56:17,960 --> 00:56:22,550
Now he's in a position to lead the repo,
the democratic side.

1171
00:56:22,551 --> 00:56:23,650
There were already there.
You know,

1172
00:56:23,651 --> 00:56:26,680
they wanted something kinder and gentler
going by the wayside.

1173
00:56:26,710 --> 00:56:29,950
Why don't want this to be dealt with in 
the most humane way.

1174
00:56:29,951 --> 00:56:34,450
That also makes sense from the country,
but he's,

1175
00:56:34,510 --> 00:56:35,343
it's a little bit like,
but slightly different than Nixon goes 

1176
00:56:37,721 --> 00:56:38,860
to China.
You know,

1177
00:56:39,040 --> 00:56:42,060
Nixon was a hard ass about China.
So when he went there,

1178
00:56:42,080 --> 00:56:44,150
people believed him that he wasn't just 
selling out,

1179
00:56:44,180 --> 00:56:45,013
he was still Nixon.
People believe that trump is still 

1180
00:56:46,931 --> 00:56:47,764
trump,
and if he sold them that he had their 

1181
00:56:49,871 --> 00:56:51,970
interests in mind,
which he totally did.

1182
00:56:52,280 --> 00:56:54,040
All right.
For his Republican base,

1183
00:56:54,370 --> 00:56:56,470
he said,
I hear you about this immigration.

1184
00:56:56,740 --> 00:56:59,230
I'm going to make it my top priority.
He paced them,

1185
00:56:59,590 --> 00:57:01,360
they trusted him,
they got into side.

1186
00:57:01,630 --> 00:57:05,950
Now trump and nobody else can soften 
that position.

1187
00:57:06,460 --> 00:57:09,460
No one else is in that position because 
of the way he did it.

1188
00:57:09,760 --> 00:57:11,890
But it looks to the public like it's a 
flip flop.

1189
00:57:12,340 --> 00:57:13,380
It's the opposite.
It's,

1190
00:57:13,390 --> 00:57:14,223
it's,
it's,

1191
00:57:14,320 --> 00:57:15,790
I'm sure it was intentional from the 
beginning.

1192
00:57:15,820 --> 00:57:16,510
Right.
So,

1193
00:57:16,510 --> 00:57:17,950
so you would say that,
you know,

1194
00:57:18,040 --> 00:57:18,873
I saw a lot of people that after Peter 
Teal spoke and trump had that nice 

1195
00:57:21,431 --> 00:57:25,460
moment actually where he said the thing 
about lgbt Americans and he got a,

1196
00:57:25,870 --> 00:57:26,703
what I think was a pretty spontaneous 
applause break from the crowd based 

1197
00:57:30,310 --> 00:57:31,230
Republicans.
Right,

1198
00:57:31,270 --> 00:57:32,103
right.
Um,

1199
00:57:32,130 --> 00:57:32,963
you know,
I saw that a lot of people after that 

1200
00:57:33,761 --> 00:57:36,040
we're saying we'll still look what's in 
the party platform.

1201
00:57:36,190 --> 00:57:38,970
And there's still stuff that's not great
on marriage equality and other things,

1202
00:57:39,130 --> 00:57:39,963
but you would argue that's basically 
irrelevant at this point because he's 

1203
00:57:42,731 --> 00:57:44,350
the,
he's the head,

1204
00:57:44,351 --> 00:57:47,090
he's the leader and he's made the 
acknowledgement so.

1205
00:57:47,340 --> 00:57:48,300
Well,
they're not done.

1206
00:57:48,330 --> 00:57:49,170
I mean there's,
you know,

1207
00:57:49,171 --> 00:57:50,670
everything's a work in progress,
right?

1208
00:57:51,150 --> 00:57:51,983
But,
uh,

1209
00:57:52,110 --> 00:57:57,000
I think trump's support of the lgbt Q,
I lose a bunch of ladders.

1210
00:57:57,001 --> 00:58:01,560
Community was both sincere and a higher 
priority than the wedding cakes.

1211
00:58:01,920 --> 00:58:05,160
And guess what?
I think the wedding cakes will be okay.

1212
00:58:05,161 --> 00:58:05,880
And the weddings,
uh,

1213
00:58:05,880 --> 00:58:07,590
yeah,
I think the Republican Party will,

1214
00:58:08,070 --> 00:58:09,270
will catch up in that sense.

1215
00:58:09,330 --> 00:58:10,163
So is that the irony?
The ultimate irony of trump more than 

1216
00:58:11,821 --> 00:58:12,654
anything else is that while these people
get shaky when you're talking to them 

1217
00:58:15,511 --> 00:58:17,880
and angry and stammering and sweaty and 
all that stuff,

1218
00:58:18,390 --> 00:58:19,223
that he actually became the Republican 
nominee by basically being pro gay 

1219
00:58:24,541 --> 00:58:25,374
marriage.
He's not going to try to flip gay 

1220
00:58:26,101 --> 00:58:26,934
marriage.
He's for gay people to live equally 

1221
00:58:29,071 --> 00:58:29,904
basically.
And at the same time he's been running 

1222
00:58:31,051 --> 00:58:33,960
an antiwar.
He certainly doesn't want a nation build

1223
00:58:33,961 --> 00:58:34,794
that's pretty obvious.
He wants people that were giving things 

1224
00:58:37,201 --> 00:58:39,090
to,
to pay us all of that stuff.

1225
00:58:39,091 --> 00:58:39,924
So he actually sort of killed the Neo 
con part of it and killed the Christian 

1226
00:58:44,311 --> 00:58:46,800
conservatives,
like he slayed them both on the way.

1227
00:58:46,970 --> 00:58:47,803
So he,
he should've become the left's favorite 

1228
00:58:49,321 --> 00:58:51,000
Republican in a bizarre way.

1229
00:58:51,640 --> 00:58:52,940
Um,
and maybe still.

1230
00:58:52,960 --> 00:58:53,591
Well,
I mean,

1231
00:58:53,591 --> 00:58:55,720
I'm still predicting that he'll win in a
landslide.

1232
00:58:56,500 --> 00:58:57,333
Uh,
I know the polls don't look like that 

1233
00:58:58,601 --> 00:59:00,610
right now,
but they're tightening as we're talking.

1234
00:59:02,050 --> 00:59:02,883
How much of that do you think is just 
that there's a certain fear of saying 

1235
00:59:05,081 --> 00:59:05,914
you're for trump

1236
00:59:06,660 --> 00:59:08,940
so people don't fall properly?
Probably a lot of it.

1237
00:59:09,190 --> 00:59:10,023
Um,
I know a lot of people who say they're 

1238
00:59:12,210 --> 00:59:13,043
a,
that they won't say out loud that they 

1239
00:59:14,610 --> 00:59:16,050
support trump.
Uh,

1240
00:59:16,051 --> 00:59:19,650
because since I said that I support 
Hillary Clinton for my personal safety.

1241
00:59:19,770 --> 00:59:20,603
Yeah.
I want to get to that because I live in 

1242
00:59:21,951 --> 00:59:22,550
California

1243
00:59:22,550 --> 00:59:24,920
where that's kind of important.
Um,

1244
00:59:25,760 --> 00:59:26,593
uh,
I've heard from people who say the same 

1245
00:59:28,491 --> 00:59:29,480
thing.
They say,

1246
00:59:29,481 --> 00:59:31,190
oh my God,
I can't say it at work.

1247
00:59:31,191 --> 00:59:33,170
I can't say it to my family who can't 
say it to my friends.

1248
00:59:33,710 --> 00:59:34,543
How many there are is the great mystery,
but I don't think they're being picked 

1249
00:59:38,181 --> 00:59:39,950
up and pulling necessarily.
Yeah.

1250
00:59:40,160 --> 00:59:43,130
What do you make of the alt right that 
everybody's talking about right now?

1251
00:59:43,160 --> 00:59:45,710
Do you?
I don't think you consider yourself part

1252
00:59:45,711 --> 00:59:47,060
of it.
You're sort of a do not.

1253
00:59:47,180 --> 00:59:48,013
You're a.
you're a parcel to it or something like 

1254
00:59:49,701 --> 00:59:50,151
that.
Right?

1255
00:59:50,151 --> 00:59:50,984
Like because they're,
they're getting two or something like 

1256
00:59:52,581 --> 00:59:53,480
that.
Like they are getting,

1257
00:59:53,481 --> 00:59:55,970
I think.
I think some of the techniques that they

1258
00:59:55,971 --> 00:59:59,890
are doing of upsetting people in power 
with memes,

1259
00:59:59,930 --> 01:00:02,000
you know you have so nobody in the 
basement,

1260
01:00:02,270 --> 01:00:04,400
they send out a Nazi meme to somebody 
important.

1261
01:00:04,400 --> 01:00:05,233
That person retweets it.
Thus you're showing that you're 

1262
01:00:06,771 --> 01:00:09,080
upsetting them and you're changing the 
game from your basement.

1263
01:00:09,200 --> 01:00:12,740
Like some of that seems like the stuff 
that you're talking about.

1264
01:00:13,130 --> 01:00:13,963
Well first of all,
I disavowed the alternative as I see 

1265
01:00:17,181 --> 01:00:17,991
what I've done here.
I said,

1266
01:00:17,991 --> 01:00:19,910
you spy,
you endorsed trump thing.

1267
01:00:19,911 --> 01:00:20,744
I'm putting you in a disavowed trump.
I disavow everybody's going to Hillary 

1268
01:00:25,310 --> 01:00:27,650
Clinton because that's best for my 
personal safety.

1269
01:00:29,120 --> 01:00:31,060
I don't even know what they all were.
The,

1270
01:00:31,190 --> 01:00:32,930
the,
the uh,

1271
01:00:33,140 --> 01:00:34,830
all right.
Even is it,

1272
01:00:34,850 --> 01:00:35,683
isn't it like a grab bag of 
miscellaneous things that other people 

1273
01:00:38,751 --> 01:00:39,584
don't like.
It was pretty much what I described at 

1274
01:00:41,811 --> 01:00:45,980
the beginning of this is polite.
People don't like it.

1275
01:00:46,070 --> 01:00:50,520
It's him.
So I'm not sure how one can,

1276
01:00:50,950 --> 01:00:53,630
can love that movement,
but it's certainly is having an impact.

1277
01:00:53,680 --> 01:00:54,513
Yeah.
But it's using the techniques you're 

1278
01:00:55,491 --> 01:00:56,420
talking about,
right?

1279
01:00:56,420 --> 01:00:57,940
Like they're doing a lot of the leads 
stuff.

1280
01:00:57,970 --> 01:01:01,280
They're upsetting people.
Empower everybody's using the techniques

1281
01:01:01,480 --> 01:01:02,990
we're using better than,
than others.

1282
01:01:03,080 --> 01:01:05,090
Um,
and yes,

1283
01:01:05,091 --> 01:01:09,340
I would say that I've observed them 
intentionally trying to use the power of

1284
01:01:09,520 --> 01:01:12,830
the tools of persuasion,
but both sides are doing that now.

1285
01:01:12,910 --> 01:01:15,230
Yeah.
I'm curious because you've become so big

1286
01:01:15,231 --> 01:01:17,600
on twitter and you have your base on 
twitter that,

1287
01:01:17,630 --> 01:01:18,463
that absolutely loves you.
Do you ever find that they're leading 

1288
01:01:20,721 --> 01:01:21,554
you?
Do you ever find that you were about to 

1289
01:01:22,401 --> 01:01:24,290
tweet something and go,
ah,

1290
01:01:24,291 --> 01:01:25,124
this could,
this could upset them or they'll get 

1291
01:01:26,991 --> 01:01:29,010
confused or,
or as someone that's,

1292
01:01:29,060 --> 01:01:29,893
that's a writer and that's able to get a
thought out in a six panel cartoon that 

1293
01:01:34,131 --> 01:01:38,030
twitter has some drawbacks when you're 
trying to really formulate a thought.

1294
01:01:38,290 --> 01:01:40,550
All communication has drawbacks.
And I definitely,

1295
01:01:40,600 --> 01:01:41,433
um,
I'm definitely informed by who is 

1296
01:01:43,641 --> 01:01:48,641
reading my tweets to keep them in a zone
that makes sense for the followers.

1297
01:01:49,760 --> 01:01:52,250
But beyond that,
I'm a big proponent of free speech,

1298
01:01:52,251 --> 01:01:55,160
so I'm not gonna I'm not gonna mute 
myself.

1299
01:01:55,520 --> 01:01:56,840
Totally.
Uh,

1300
01:01:56,890 --> 01:02:00,890
I have what I lovingly recall.
Fuck you money.

1301
01:02:02,090 --> 01:02:05,010
So I don't have a boss.
You don't need to.

1302
01:02:05,090 --> 01:02:05,923
I don't need to make other people happy.
If I have something that needs to be 

1303
01:02:07,851 --> 01:02:08,660
said,
I can do that.

1304
01:02:08,660 --> 01:02:10,010
Yeah,
you don't have to tell me the number.

1305
01:02:10,011 --> 01:02:11,780
But when did you realize you had fuck 
you money?

1306
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:15,810
Um,
10 years ago probably.

1307
01:02:15,950 --> 01:02:16,783
All right,
so let's do a little bit on hillary 

1308
01:02:17,541 --> 01:02:19,160
because we kind of danced around her a 
bit.

1309
01:02:19,230 --> 01:02:20,090
Uh,
it's

1310
01:02:20,090 --> 01:02:22,350
sort of all,
it's all encompassing.

1311
01:02:22,351 --> 01:02:23,250
This,
the top trump,

1312
01:02:23,251 --> 01:02:25,740
you're sort of talking hillary already.
We're just stuck in this thing.

1313
01:02:26,030 --> 01:02:28,080
Um,
what do you make of her?

1314
01:02:28,081 --> 01:02:28,914
Do you think?
It seems just uninspiring to me and I 

1315
01:02:31,321 --> 01:02:36,321
consider her as much of a liar as I 
consider trump and we're just screwed.

1316
01:02:37,170 --> 01:02:38,910
How's that?
How's that for a lead?

1317
01:02:39,680 --> 01:02:40,513
I'll tell you at this point in the race 
if you're going to vote for the one 

1318
01:02:43,311 --> 01:02:46,340
who's not the liar,
good luck.

1319
01:02:46,720 --> 01:02:49,100
Good luck.
I think there was a,

1320
01:02:49,130 --> 01:02:49,963
there was a point early on in the race 
where you could say trump is lying way 

1321
01:02:53,511 --> 01:02:54,344
more than Clinton,
but I think that difference has been 

1322
01:02:56,091 --> 01:02:58,880
erased and the reason is that lying 
worked really,

1323
01:02:58,881 --> 01:03:01,550
really well.
And so Clinton is sort of,

1324
01:03:01,610 --> 01:03:03,840
as I said earlier,
dispense with the facts that.

1325
01:03:03,841 --> 01:03:07,180
And she's more about a user are racist 
and misogynist.

1326
01:03:07,190 --> 01:03:08,690
And I don't think,
as I've said,

1327
01:03:08,691 --> 01:03:11,000
I think that's confirmation bias.
It's not fact,

1328
01:03:11,870 --> 01:03:15,460
but the race has almost entirely,
if you think about it,

1329
01:03:15,470 --> 01:03:17,210
it's.
I've never seen this before.

1330
01:03:17,600 --> 01:03:18,433
The race has gone from talking about 
policies and things in the world to 

1331
01:03:22,941 --> 01:03:23,774
almost entirely talking about this gray 
lump of matter in each of their heads 

1332
01:03:28,730 --> 01:03:29,370
like that,
you know,

1333
01:03:29,370 --> 01:03:30,130
is,
is,

1334
01:03:30,130 --> 01:03:33,650
is Hillary's sick or lying or whatever 
is trump,

1335
01:03:33,680 --> 01:03:34,580
you know,
a crazy,

1336
01:03:34,581 --> 01:03:36,080
racist,
misogynist or whatever,

1337
01:03:36,410 --> 01:03:38,840
but it's all about the gray thing in 
their skull.

1338
01:03:39,200 --> 01:03:40,190
Like,
what about the world?

1339
01:03:41,230 --> 01:03:43,420
Right?
So was that the obvious outcome here?

1340
01:03:43,421 --> 01:03:44,460
In a weird way,
if you,

1341
01:03:44,740 --> 01:03:48,070
if you go back six months and you really
saw what was going to happen here,

1342
01:03:48,071 --> 01:03:48,904
and you look at Hillary and Bernie,
actually they were gonna take him down 

1343
01:03:51,131 --> 01:03:53,890
no matter what.
And if you saw what trump was building,

1344
01:03:53,891 --> 01:03:54,724
which as you said,
you saw it a little earlier than most 

1345
01:03:56,411 --> 01:03:57,490
people.
In a way,

1346
01:03:57,491 --> 01:04:00,100
this was the obvious.
We were going to get to this,

1347
01:04:00,101 --> 01:04:01,090
right?
No matter what,

1348
01:04:02,360 --> 01:04:05,480
probably the gravity was sucking us to 
this place.

1349
01:04:05,481 --> 01:04:06,050
Yes.
The,

1350
01:04:06,050 --> 01:04:09,680
the only unknown was whether Hillary 
would go as dark as she went.

1351
01:04:09,830 --> 01:04:13,040
By the way that were dark probably came 
from Godzilla.

1352
01:04:13,810 --> 01:04:14,470
Um,
that's,

1353
01:04:14,470 --> 01:04:15,303
that's an engineered word.
That's the word that you don't hear in 

1354
01:04:17,361 --> 01:04:18,194
politics,
which is designed to attract 

1355
01:04:19,821 --> 01:04:21,020
confirmation bias.
Hey,

1356
01:04:21,021 --> 01:04:22,820
everything trump is doing is dark now

1357
01:04:23,750 --> 01:04:25,460
for people that missed the beginning of 
that clip.

1358
01:04:25,461 --> 01:04:27,020
That's what.
What's the guy's name again?

1359
01:04:27,300 --> 01:04:29,820
Uh,
so that would be Robert Cialdini.

1360
01:04:29,821 --> 01:04:30,654
I'm just hypothesizing.
I don't have confirmation that he's 

1361
01:04:33,751 --> 01:04:37,590
working on the Clinton campaign advising
her in the persuasion arts.

1362
01:04:37,740 --> 01:04:38,730
Yeah.
Um,

1363
01:04:38,731 --> 01:04:41,010
okay.
So let's put trump and Clinton aside for

1364
01:04:41,011 --> 01:04:41,844
a second and I want to finish up with 
free speech because that's sort of in 

1365
01:04:44,131 --> 01:04:44,964
the thrust of everything that I do here.
And I know it's something that's 

1366
01:04:46,921 --> 01:04:49,150
obviously very important to you.
Um,

1367
01:04:49,230 --> 01:04:53,190
what do you make of the state of free 
speech in America in 2016 as a,

1368
01:04:53,191 --> 01:04:54,024
as a creator,
as someone that puts thoughts out there 

1369
01:04:56,130 --> 01:04:56,963
and you do poke funded a lot of our 
societal nonsensical ways that we self 

1370
01:05:02,101 --> 01:05:02,630
censor.

1371
01:05:02,630 --> 01:05:03,330
Yeah,
it's,

1372
01:05:03,330 --> 01:05:04,163
it's interesting in many ways the world 
is going in the same direction in the 

1373
01:05:08,211 --> 01:05:11,150
sense that there's more of everything.
I mean,

1374
01:05:11,180 --> 01:05:12,013
I think in the old days,
more of something less of something 

1375
01:05:14,511 --> 01:05:15,344
else,
but now there are more places that you 

1376
01:05:17,140 --> 01:05:19,660
speak with complete freedom,
you know,

1377
01:05:19,750 --> 01:05:20,583
online and then there are fewer places 
that you could do the same thing in 

1378
01:05:24,131 --> 01:05:24,964
corporate America or in other places.
So in some ways there's more freedom 

1379
01:05:28,391 --> 01:05:31,500
than ever,
but in a whole lot of places in,

1380
01:05:31,550 --> 01:05:33,850
in troubling ways,
there's less than ever.

1381
01:05:34,870 --> 01:05:35,703
I'm a little on the fence about how much
of that is bad and how much of it is 

1382
01:05:42,071 --> 01:05:45,280
good because I do think that words 
matter.

1383
01:05:46,210 --> 01:05:47,570
And I think that,
uh,

1384
01:05:47,830 --> 01:05:48,663
there are places where civil 
conversation is more important than say 

1385
01:05:52,691 --> 01:05:53,710
in your mind,
right?

1386
01:05:54,130 --> 01:05:58,000
For freedom of speech is overrated in 
some contexts,

1387
01:05:58,300 --> 01:05:59,133
but you certainly have to have it to 
have an effective government and an 

1388
01:06:01,361 --> 01:06:02,194
effective country.

1389
01:06:02,220 --> 01:06:04,120
Right.
So to that end,

1390
01:06:04,121 --> 01:06:05,890
do you say Asana,
bringing it back to trump,

1391
01:06:05,891 --> 01:06:07,110
but unfortunately here,
but I have to,

1392
01:06:07,130 --> 01:06:10,150
for the purposes of that,
do you think that once in office,

1393
01:06:10,151 --> 01:06:10,984
if he became president,
do you think he'd be able to have those 

1394
01:06:13,361 --> 01:06:14,194
conversations in that sort of space 
where he's not doing these all these 

1395
01:06:19,240 --> 01:06:21,130
tricks but doing,
I suspect your,

1396
01:06:21,200 --> 01:06:22,033
these?
Yeah.

1397
01:06:22,310 --> 01:06:23,143
Well,
I think if you imagine a president 

1398
01:06:24,581 --> 01:06:25,530
trump,
um,

1399
01:06:25,750 --> 01:06:29,200
I could see two things happening once 
that everybody moderates,

1400
01:06:29,201 --> 01:06:32,380
once they get the job.
I remember back in my corporate days,

1401
01:06:32,690 --> 01:06:33,270
um,
you know,

1402
01:06:33,270 --> 01:06:34,103
one of my coworkers would get promoted 
to an important level of responsibility 

1403
01:06:37,600 --> 01:06:39,670
and their personality would just change 
overnight.

1404
01:06:39,910 --> 01:06:42,520
It started getting serious and they 
would stop joking around.

1405
01:06:43,060 --> 01:06:45,430
Certainly trump would be doing some of 
that,

1406
01:06:45,490 --> 01:06:46,323
right?
So there would be some moderation just 

1407
01:06:47,171 --> 01:06:50,590
because the job,
I imagine just imagine yourself,

1408
01:06:51,010 --> 01:06:51,610
you know,
you're,

1409
01:06:51,610 --> 01:06:54,850
no matter what you're thinking before 
you walk into the Oval Office,

1410
01:06:55,000 --> 01:06:55,570
right?

1411
01:06:55,570 --> 01:06:58,840
You walk into the Oval Office,
you're in the White House,

1412
01:06:59,270 --> 01:07:01,570
all right?
There's no way that doesn't change.

1413
01:07:01,980 --> 01:07:03,570
It's real now.
It's real.

1414
01:07:04,080 --> 01:07:05,740
That's the biggest influence you could 
have,

1415
01:07:05,940 --> 01:07:07,930
and in fact,
a Chilean even writes about this,

1416
01:07:07,931 --> 01:07:11,470
the influence of your physical 
environment in his new book,

1417
01:07:11,471 --> 01:07:12,560
which I'll,
I'll plug for them.

1418
01:07:13,120 --> 01:07:18,120
Presuasion predestination will be the 
biggest book about persuasion.

1419
01:07:18,221 --> 01:07:20,440
The world's ever seen.
It will be massive.

1420
01:07:20,860 --> 01:07:22,420
I got an early copy,
so I saw,

1421
01:07:23,040 --> 01:07:24,220
um,
yes,

1422
01:07:24,221 --> 01:07:26,430
so trouble moderate just because of the 
physical,

1423
01:07:26,650 --> 01:07:28,420
you know,
power of the office,

1424
01:07:28,990 --> 01:07:33,730
but also he's also created in 
everybody's mind and expectation that he

1425
01:07:33,731 --> 01:07:36,400
does things that other people don't.
So if you're,

1426
01:07:36,460 --> 01:07:41,200
let's say you know that the heads of 
China or Russia and trump says,

1427
01:07:41,520 --> 01:07:43,510
you know,
a crazy thing that people don't normally

1428
01:07:43,511 --> 01:07:44,980
say,
they're not going to say,

1429
01:07:45,040 --> 01:07:46,810
oh my God,
here it comes to the nukes.

1430
01:07:47,250 --> 01:07:48,083
They're good.
They're going to say that's what he 

1431
01:07:48,881 --> 01:07:49,650
does.
That's.

1432
01:07:49,650 --> 01:07:51,660
Yeah.
So we have to stop thinking that China's

1433
01:07:51,700 --> 01:07:52,533
a bunch of idiots.
They're going to misconstrue what's 

1434
01:07:54,971 --> 01:07:57,700
happening over here.
It could not be more clear.

1435
01:07:57,790 --> 01:07:59,920
The trump says things.
Other people that would say.

1436
01:07:59,921 --> 01:08:02,230
So if he does more of it,
people are gonna say,

1437
01:08:02,231 --> 01:08:03,064
well,
there's more of it.

1438
01:08:03,210 --> 01:08:04,043
Right?
So basically they would just have to 

1439
01:08:05,351 --> 01:08:10,150
learn how to readjust already have,
I mean I think that process is done,

1440
01:08:10,550 --> 01:08:11,383
you know,
you just have to see enough of him to 

1441
01:08:12,251 --> 01:08:13,330
say,
okay,

1442
01:08:13,331 --> 01:08:18,331
he's talking like I'm going to say a new
and we get that.

1443
01:08:18,720 --> 01:08:21,290
Yeah.
Once you get the that that's his style,

1444
01:08:21,300 --> 01:08:22,070
you're okay with it.

1445
01:08:22,070 --> 01:08:22,903
Yeah.
I think it's interesting what you said 

1446
01:08:23,511 --> 01:08:24,344
about how so in some ways it feels like 
we have less free speech and in some 

1447
01:08:27,831 --> 01:08:28,664
ways it feels like we have more because 
people will now use the internet to do 

1448
01:08:31,791 --> 01:08:32,990
this.
There's some,

1449
01:08:33,000 --> 01:08:33,833
I'm a little caught between feeling that
the Internet side of it is good and bad 

1450
01:08:37,041 --> 01:08:39,650
because so many people are doing it at 
that.

1451
01:08:39,651 --> 01:08:40,484
I feel like I'm buried.
They're exercising their right to free 

1452
01:08:43,971 --> 01:08:44,804
speech,
but then it also comes with you say all 

1453
01:08:47,211 --> 01:08:50,870
kinds of things that you would never say
in person.

1454
01:08:51,080 --> 01:08:53,530
I have no problem with what they say.
As I say all the time that the show,

1455
01:08:53,550 --> 01:08:54,383
I don't like the Nazi memes and showing 
all these rays actual racist things 

1456
01:08:58,731 --> 01:09:02,030
about black people or whatever.
I wouldn't stop them from doing it,

1457
01:09:02,390 --> 01:09:04,490
um,
but I guess,

1458
01:09:04,520 --> 01:09:05,353
but still you would say that's a net 
good because at least there's the 

1459
01:09:07,311 --> 01:09:08,144
outlet.

1460
01:09:08,850 --> 01:09:09,930
Yeah.
Um,

1461
01:09:10,100 --> 01:09:14,310
I would say that anonymity is essential 
in a free society.

1462
01:09:14,311 --> 01:09:17,130
You got to be able to say some things 
anonymously,

1463
01:09:17,880 --> 01:09:18,713
but I'd also say that the cure for all 
the bad stuff is sunlight and the more 

1464
01:09:24,631 --> 01:09:27,360
of the anonymous people say horrible 
things,

1465
01:09:27,840 --> 01:09:30,460
the more of the sunlight starts to,
you know,

1466
01:09:30,461 --> 01:09:33,990
eroded.
So I think you have to let it out before

1467
01:09:33,991 --> 01:09:35,310
you can kill it.
Yeah.

1468
01:09:35,740 --> 01:09:37,450
So to that point,
would you,

1469
01:09:37,451 --> 01:09:38,284
if someone was tweeting you all day and 
sending you awful Nazi memes or any of 

1470
01:09:41,861 --> 01:09:46,780
this made my entire day.
I said my policy is I just ignore them.

1471
01:09:46,781 --> 01:09:50,330
Occasionally I mute them and on a very 
rare occasion if they just won't stop,

1472
01:09:50,350 --> 01:09:52,140
then I'll block them.
Um,

1473
01:09:52,550 --> 01:09:55,150
but I never amplify them because I feel 
like,

1474
01:09:55,151 --> 01:09:55,984
well,
if I don't really pretend that they're 

1475
01:09:57,550 --> 01:09:59,380
here then unless they,
you know what I mean?

1476
01:09:59,381 --> 01:10:01,150
Like they're not outside with 
pitchforks,

1477
01:10:01,330 --> 01:10:03,400
they're just doing it from the comfort 
of their own computer.

1478
01:10:03,730 --> 01:10:04,563
Do you basically think that that's a 
good policy and in this way because 

1479
01:10:08,111 --> 01:10:10,660
otherwise I feel like we're just making 
their ideas bigger if every time,

1480
01:10:10,661 --> 01:10:11,494
if I get outraged that they sent me 
something upsetting and then I outrage 

1481
01:10:14,231 --> 01:10:17,890
somebody else by retweeting it and then 
it becomes this never ending thing.

1482
01:10:17,920 --> 01:10:18,753
I feel like I'm judging everyone 
individually because every once in a 

1483
01:10:21,221 --> 01:10:23,920
while they'll say something that links 
to some data.

1484
01:10:23,990 --> 01:10:27,010
Yeah,
and now look at that and say that's data

1485
01:10:27,080 --> 01:10:28,100
that.
I mean I don't.

1486
01:10:28,150 --> 01:10:28,983
Maybe I don't like where their 
implication or where it heads or or any 

1487
01:10:31,931 --> 01:10:32,764
of that,
but data is data so those I tend to let 

1488
01:10:36,250 --> 01:10:38,870
stay,
but if somebody just comes on and yelled

1489
01:10:38,880 --> 01:10:42,100
some racial stuff that I usually just 
block them right away.

1490
01:10:42,220 --> 01:10:42,790
Yeah.

1491
01:10:42,790 --> 01:10:43,750
All right.
Final thought.

1492
01:10:43,751 --> 01:10:44,980
You've already predicted.
It's a.

1493
01:10:44,981 --> 01:10:48,640
you're predicting a trump landslide.
Do you want to give you some percentages

1494
01:10:48,910 --> 01:10:50,590
but you want to put yourself out there

1495
01:10:50,750 --> 01:10:51,583
that I said some from last year,
98 percent trump landslide and hasn't 

1496
01:10:55,531 --> 01:10:56,364
changed.
What has changed is that he's had 

1497
01:10:57,781 --> 01:11:02,010
terrible weeks and if that week was the 
only thing that happened until the end,

1498
01:11:02,310 --> 01:11:04,500
of course he would lose,
but that never stays the same.

1499
01:11:04,880 --> 01:11:05,713
That weeks are going to be up and down.
I think there are some big shocks to 

1500
01:11:08,071 --> 01:11:08,904
come.
I think that all the trump shocks are 

1501
01:11:10,591 --> 01:11:11,424
baked in.
There's almost nothing you could hear 

1502
01:11:12,841 --> 01:11:16,170
about unless it was totally out of left 
field that would make any difference.

1503
01:11:16,171 --> 01:11:17,004
Right?
But there's a whole bunch of stuff you 

1504
01:11:18,331 --> 01:11:20,070
could hear about Clinton.
Um,

1505
01:11:20,310 --> 01:11:22,290
especially since she has government 
experience,

1506
01:11:22,320 --> 01:11:23,090
right?
That,

1507
01:11:23,090 --> 01:11:23,923
that makes them more vulnerable to a 
shock because if he did it in the 

1508
01:11:26,161 --> 01:11:27,840
context of the government,
it seems worse.

1509
01:11:28,820 --> 01:11:29,653
Um,
so that alone I think almost guarantees 

1510
01:11:31,440 --> 01:11:32,273
a trump victory really.
So basically that wiki leaks could just 

1511
01:11:34,651 --> 01:11:36,900
drop something because we know they're 
holding something.

1512
01:11:36,980 --> 01:11:39,600
It doesn't even have to be wiki leaks 
could be anything.

1513
01:11:39,770 --> 01:11:41,490
It could be anything A.
Well,

1514
01:11:41,491 --> 01:11:42,324
I've thoroughly enjoyed talking to you 
and I'm glad we were able to talk about 

1515
01:11:44,491 --> 01:11:45,324
some of this stuff without sort of the 
craziness attached to it because it 

1516
01:11:48,660 --> 01:11:50,640
doesn't it feel like it's just crazy all
the time.

1517
01:11:50,641 --> 01:11:52,740
Right?
Crazy in the most entertaining ways.

1518
01:11:53,100 --> 01:11:55,290
I have never had more fun year of my 
life.

1519
01:11:55,710 --> 01:11:56,543
I got to say I wake up every happy 
because the news is going to entertain 

1520
01:11:59,551 --> 01:12:01,060
me and,
and,

1521
01:12:01,110 --> 01:12:02,430
and people are.
People are.

1522
01:12:03,300 --> 01:12:05,930
People are engaged.
Engagement,

1523
01:12:05,970 --> 01:12:06,803
the engagement.
Look,

1524
01:12:06,930 --> 01:12:07,763
look what people learned about their 
government this year about how the 

1525
01:12:10,501 --> 01:12:11,760
primaries work,
you know,

1526
01:12:11,761 --> 01:12:12,594
that they are rigged a little bit.
I mean just the level of human 

1527
01:12:16,351 --> 01:12:17,184
engagement is off the chart and I would 
go so far as to say that a president 

1528
01:12:20,491 --> 01:12:21,324
trump would probably encourage more 
direct public participation because it 

1529
01:12:28,291 --> 01:12:29,460
just feels like he needs it.

1530
01:12:31,080 --> 01:12:32,610
Clinton,
which was because he just loves it.

1531
01:12:32,611 --> 01:12:33,660
He loves that.
Well,

1532
01:12:33,661 --> 01:12:34,494
I think Clinton would do her thing and 
her lobbyists would writer write 

1533
01:12:37,411 --> 01:12:39,000
legislation.
It'd be like always,

1534
01:12:39,450 --> 01:12:40,283
but if you saw president trump,
you'd think almost anything was 

1535
01:12:41,881 --> 01:12:43,440
possible.
So you'd say,

1536
01:12:43,441 --> 01:12:44,274
I got an idea and people are already 
sending me all these ideas for building 

1537
01:12:47,191 --> 01:12:48,024
the border wall with a,
with a light rail train on the top and 

1538
01:12:50,671 --> 01:12:52,920
businesses and casinos and,
you know,

1539
01:12:52,921 --> 01:12:53,754
making it,
uh,

1540
01:12:53,930 --> 01:12:55,200
you know,
economic zone,

1541
01:12:55,240 --> 01:12:56,100
good guy.
We're here,

1542
01:12:56,101 --> 01:12:59,850
we're hearing all this big thinking on 
one side and I,

1543
01:12:59,851 --> 01:13:02,850
I feel like something's being unleashed 
in a good way.

1544
01:13:02,860 --> 01:13:05,970
Like a creative thing and we hope it's 
not the,

1545
01:13:06,060 --> 01:13:09,090
you know,
some kind of a race war.

1546
01:13:09,780 --> 01:13:11,100
Yeah.
Is Out World War three.

1547
01:13:11,360 --> 01:13:14,600
All right,
well for more Scott and,

1548
01:13:14,601 --> 01:13:17,010
uh,
the dilbert cartoon and his thoughts and

1549
01:13:17,011 --> 01:13:20,700
blog and all that,
you can check out blog.dilbert.com.

1550
01:13:21,000 --> 01:13:23,340
Thanks for watching.
And we will do it again next week.
