1
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:05,873
With six days left to the election,
it's incredible how little public 

2
00:00:08,521 --> 00:00:11,940
discourse this past year has had do with
the actual issues.

3
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:16,320
Immigration has become a meme fest 
revolving around trump's proposed wall.

4
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:17,183
Abortion was basically relegated to one 
three minute exchange in the final 

5
00:00:20,551 --> 00:00:21,384
debate.
There's been virtually nothing on 

6
00:00:22,981 --> 00:00:26,310
legalizing marijuana,
the war on drugs or reforming our prison

7
00:00:26,311 --> 00:00:29,130
system.
Foreign policy has been reduced to trump

8
00:00:29,131 --> 00:00:29,964
saying he can't tell us what he's going 
to do so that he doesn't tip anyone off 

9
00:00:32,790 --> 00:00:36,450
versus Hillary promoting her experience,
much of which was a disaster.

10
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:39,990
There's been pretty much no talk of 
infrastructure or education,

11
00:00:39,991 --> 00:00:42,930
but a whole lot on genital grabbing and 
hacked emails.

12
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:44,513
My hope is that this is the last 
election will ever have were seemingly 

13
00:00:47,461 --> 00:00:52,170
every major issue is neglected,
and the minute he said she said,

14
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:55,830
get center stage.
Out of all of this anger and frustration

15
00:00:55,831 --> 00:00:57,090
in general lunacy.

16
00:00:57,090 --> 00:01:00,270
I really do believe that something good 
will rise from the ashes.

17
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:03,210
The majority of us want to talk about 
the real issues.

18
00:01:03,211 --> 00:01:04,044
We don't want to demonize everyone.
We don't want to be pandered to and we 

19
00:01:06,811 --> 00:01:07,644
do want to find solutions.
We got in this political mess this year 

20
00:01:10,861 --> 00:01:11,694
because for so long we've allowed the 
system to let the lowest common 

21
00:01:14,821 --> 00:01:15,654
denominator rise to the top.
Maybe we needed this freak show to 

22
00:01:18,871 --> 00:01:21,840
happen so that the masses,
the silent majority,

23
00:01:21,841 --> 00:01:25,530
would finally wake up and realize that 
it's actually our lives,

24
00:01:25,531 --> 00:01:28,200
our welfare,
and our families on the line.

25
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:32,250
Every generation has something new to 
fight for and maybe for this generation,

26
00:01:32,251 --> 00:01:36,210
the fight will be to recreate a system 
by the people and for the people.

27
00:01:36,270 --> 00:01:37,103
That's why the next few years are going 
to be an incredibly important piece of 

28
00:01:39,811 --> 00:01:40,644
history where we sit back and let the 
worst of us continue to take control or 

29
00:01:44,770 --> 00:01:45,900
will we fight back?

30
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:46,733
Will we find allies where we used to 
find enemies and what we stand for 

31
00:01:49,831 --> 00:01:52,590
principles even when it's not popular to
do so.

32
00:01:53,250 --> 00:01:55,530
I really believe that will do the right 
thing,

33
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:56,393
but the only way we'll do it is by 
really discussing issues and not the 

34
00:01:59,341 --> 00:02:00,174
side show.
Let's demand that our leaders explain 

35
00:02:01,921 --> 00:02:04,770
why they believe in what they believe,
why they vote,

36
00:02:04,771 --> 00:02:05,604
the way they vote,
and why they deserve the right to speak 

37
00:02:08,521 --> 00:02:09,354
for us as citizens.
Let's step back from the scandals and 

38
00:02:11,821 --> 00:02:14,730
the screaming and focus on education and
empowerment.

39
00:02:15,090 --> 00:02:18,420
Politicians in the media aren't going to
magically just become better.

40
00:02:18,421 --> 00:02:19,254
We have to demand that they do and the 
only way that we can demand it is if we 

41
00:02:22,921 --> 00:02:23,754
demand it from ourselves.
We can start by being outspoken instead 

42
00:02:27,031 --> 00:02:27,864
of just outraged.
This week we're continuing our 

43
00:02:30,001 --> 00:02:33,840
collaboration with learn liberty.
We're teaming up with learn liberty once

44
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:34,673
a month to talk to professors,
thought leaders and authors on a wide 

45
00:02:37,081 --> 00:02:37,914
variety of topics all related to free 
speech and classical liberalism to 

46
00:02:41,431 --> 00:02:43,800
things we could certainly use a little 
more of these days.

47
00:02:44,310 --> 00:02:45,143
Joining me this week is Dr Steve Davies.
Dr Davis is head of education at the 

48
00:02:50,250 --> 00:02:51,083
Institute of Economic Affairs in London.
He's also a lecturer and a historian 

49
00:02:53,071 --> 00:02:55,830
whose research includes crime and 
criminal justice,

50
00:02:56,100 --> 00:02:58,530
the history of ideas and political 
thought,

51
00:02:58,780 --> 00:02:59,980
comparative economic

52
00:03:00,010 --> 00:03:01,480
history,
and much more.

53
00:03:01,690 --> 00:03:03,830
In short,
this guy knows his stuff and we're going

54
00:03:03,831 --> 00:03:07,240
to get into all of it or at least as 
much as we can in an hour.

55
00:03:07,690 --> 00:03:08,523
So sit back,
take a break from the sound bytes and 

56
00:03:09,941 --> 00:03:13,210
distractions and open your minds to the 
issues that matter.

57
00:03:13,211 --> 00:03:15,970
Your brain will thank you and your 
country will too.

58
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:23,970
We're continuing our monthly 
collaboration with my friends with learn

59
00:03:23,971 --> 00:03:24,804
liberty.
This week my guest is head of education 

60
00:03:26,491 --> 00:03:27,324
at the Institute for Economic Affairs in
London as well as a historian and 

61
00:03:30,841 --> 00:03:34,590
lecturer and he flew all the way across 
the pond to be here.

62
00:03:34,770 --> 00:03:36,570
Dr Steve Davies.
Welcome to the show.

63
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:37,890
Thank you very much.
Glad to be here.

64
00:03:38,130 --> 00:03:40,590
I heard you got held up by President 
Obama,

65
00:03:40,770 --> 00:03:41,603
so we did.
We just got told that a vip was going 

66
00:03:44,791 --> 00:03:47,430
through the airport and so they have 
just shut it down for half an hour.

67
00:03:47,431 --> 00:03:48,264
So we were held up.
I guess he must have been really 

68
00:03:49,591 --> 00:03:50,530
important.
Yeah.

69
00:03:50,550 --> 00:03:51,383
After 11 and a half hour flight,
you don't even want to hear that it's 

70
00:03:53,521 --> 00:03:55,530
the president or there's nobody really 
that.

71
00:03:55,910 --> 00:03:58,150
Absolutely.
So.

72
00:03:58,160 --> 00:03:58,993
All right.
There's so much that I want to do with 

73
00:03:59,911 --> 00:04:01,890
you and I watched a ton of your learn 
liberty videos,

74
00:04:01,891 --> 00:04:02,724
so I'm.
I'm pretty well versed in some of the 

75
00:04:04,241 --> 00:04:05,310
stuff that you're well versed in.

76
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:08,640
First,
did you want to come to America just one

77
00:04:08,641 --> 00:04:10,770
more time before our election?
Well,

78
00:04:10,771 --> 00:04:11,604
absolutely.
There's something really strange going 

79
00:04:12,781 --> 00:04:15,040
on here in the United States.
I think it's fair to say,

80
00:04:15,420 --> 00:04:16,253
although maybe not that strange because 
I actually think that what's happening 

81
00:04:18,991 --> 00:04:19,824
with Donald Trump is pulse for more 
widespread phenomenon in most western 

82
00:04:22,921 --> 00:04:26,610
democracies,
which is the rise of a kind of politics.

83
00:04:26,620 --> 00:04:27,453
It's commonly described,
I think misleadingly as right wing 

84
00:04:30,121 --> 00:04:30,954
populism and what it actually is is a 
politics that combines left of center 

85
00:04:34,861 --> 00:04:35,694
economics,
strong support for the welfare state 

86
00:04:37,170 --> 00:04:38,003
with an extremely unpleasant kind of 
nativism and she globalism and 

87
00:04:41,130 --> 00:04:41,963
nationalism,
and that's pretty much where Donald 

88
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:44,513
Trump is coming from.
It's straightforward Hamiltonian 

89
00:04:45,841 --> 00:04:46,674
economic nationalism combined with a 
very unpleasant kind of identity 

90
00:04:49,351 --> 00:04:50,460
politics,
I would say,

91
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:52,890
but he's not alone.
He's possibly much bigger phenomenon.

92
00:04:53,010 --> 00:04:53,843
Okay,
so let's unpack a couple of those 

93
00:04:54,631 --> 00:04:55,260
phrases.

94
00:04:55,260 --> 00:04:59,490
So you'd say this isn't a right wing 
phenomenon because his politics are kind

95
00:04:59,491 --> 00:05:01,260
of are kind of lame,
right?

96
00:05:01,590 --> 00:05:03,240
Uh,
and that it's that,

97
00:05:03,241 --> 00:05:06,870
but he is using nationalism so that,
that is more of the right side.

98
00:05:07,020 --> 00:05:07,853
What,
what were the other parts that were the 

99
00:05:09,151 --> 00:05:12,420
source of support for the welfare state 
support for the strictly national basis,

100
00:05:12,421 --> 00:05:13,254
I mean,
the correct name for this kind of 

101
00:05:14,401 --> 00:05:16,440
politics I think is nationalist 
collectivism.

102
00:05:17,210 --> 00:05:18,043
You could call it national socialism,
but the kinds of being claimed already 

103
00:05:20,431 --> 00:05:22,390
that might be a little too scary,
too scary.

104
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:26,520
It's nationalist collectivism basically.
And it's on the rise across most Western

105
00:05:26,521 --> 00:05:28,560
democracies.
Few exceptions like Spain,

106
00:05:28,890 --> 00:05:29,910
Portugal,
Ireland,

107
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:31,073
but otherwise this is the kind of 
politics that we see on the rise 

108
00:05:32,881 --> 00:05:33,714
everywhere.
I'm afraid Marine Le Pen in France get 

109
00:05:35,101 --> 00:05:35,934
builders in the Netherlands,
Donald Trump here pretty much 

110
00:05:38,131 --> 00:05:39,690
everywhere.
Canada is another exception.

111
00:05:40,230 --> 00:05:42,990
So what is happening globally that has 
caused that?

112
00:05:42,991 --> 00:05:43,824
This isn't just a fun.
I mean I think everyone in America 

113
00:05:45,241 --> 00:05:48,040
thinks everything is about us all the 
time and this is just our phenomenon.

114
00:05:48,041 --> 00:05:50,580
It has nothing to do with anything else,
but what's happening?

115
00:05:50,750 --> 00:05:51,900
Well,
there are two things.

116
00:05:51,901 --> 00:05:52,734
I think one of them is that a lot of the
support for this kind of politics comes 

117
00:05:55,501 --> 00:06:00,060
from older working class voters in what 
you would call the rust belt,

118
00:06:00,380 --> 00:06:01,213
a decade x industrial areas where life 
has not been good for quite a long time 

119
00:06:05,660 --> 00:06:08,840
and these people feel that they're 
ignored by the political establishment,

120
00:06:08,870 --> 00:06:12,590
that the system is not working in their 
interests and that kicking back.

121
00:06:12,740 --> 00:06:13,940
Yeah.
That's one reason.

122
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,130
And some of that you think you would 
argue is legit,

123
00:06:16,131 --> 00:06:16,351
right?
Yeah.

124
00:06:16,351 --> 00:06:16,980
It's legitimate.
Yeah.

125
00:06:16,980 --> 00:06:18,170
Dude,
they're quite right.

126
00:06:18,190 --> 00:06:19,023
You know,
life has been pretty hard for them for 

127
00:06:19,821 --> 00:06:20,654
quite a long time.

128
00:06:21,190 --> 00:06:23,540
The other thing though,
which I actually think is more important

129
00:06:23,541 --> 00:06:25,310
is it's to do with the politics of 
identity.

130
00:06:25,710 --> 00:06:27,950
Uh,
it's to do with a feeling that a certain

131
00:06:27,951 --> 00:06:31,460
kind of identity is under threat from 
the process of globalization.

132
00:06:31,461 --> 00:06:33,940
Cosmopolitanism,
maybe political correctness,

133
00:06:33,950 --> 00:06:34,783
a whole bunch of stuff like that.
So there's a very powerful cultural 

134
00:06:37,460 --> 00:06:38,293
reaction,
a reassertion of a certain kind of 

135
00:06:40,191 --> 00:06:41,080
identity.
Uh,

136
00:06:41,130 --> 00:06:41,963
and I think that is what is really 
potent and really driving this kind of 

137
00:06:44,811 --> 00:06:45,644
politics.
So how much of that is just a reaction 

138
00:06:49,251 --> 00:06:51,110
to some of this stuff happening on the 
left?

139
00:06:51,140 --> 00:06:51,860
That's,
you know,

140
00:06:51,860 --> 00:06:53,120
I,
I come from the left,

141
00:06:53,121 --> 00:06:53,954
so that's the part that I've been 
focusing on and I do see a certain 

142
00:06:56,811 --> 00:06:57,644
element of the rise of trump and the 
political correctness stuff and you 

143
00:07:01,391 --> 00:07:03,110
know,
the social justice warrior stuff.

144
00:07:03,290 --> 00:07:04,123
I see it as a natural reaction to what 
has happened on the left or maybe maybe 

145
00:07:08,151 --> 00:07:08,480
in Europe.

146
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:12,470
It's more because of immigration that 
these marine Le Pen for example,

147
00:07:12,471 --> 00:07:13,304
et Cetera.
I think that there is an element of 

148
00:07:14,470 --> 00:07:15,890
truth in both of those things.
Actually.

149
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:18,500
Undoubtedly the push button issue,
uh,

150
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:21,260
as we saw in the brexit referendum in 
the UK for example,

151
00:07:21,290 --> 00:07:23,630
uh,
and with Marion Le Pen is immigration,

152
00:07:23,660 --> 00:07:25,250
particularly immigration from the Middle
East,

153
00:07:25,460 --> 00:07:27,140
but also from other parts of the world 
as well.

154
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:30,470
But that's in a way is not so much 
because of immigration per se.

155
00:07:30,471 --> 00:07:31,304
It's because the way in which large 
scale movement into people is seemed to 

156
00:07:33,831 --> 00:07:34,664
be transforming and changing the nature 
of a settled and established a national 

157
00:07:38,210 --> 00:07:39,043
community.
And now I think that in terms of 

158
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:41,900
particularly the United States,
yes,

159
00:07:41,901 --> 00:07:43,710
there is quite a lot of pushback 
against,

160
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:44,833
uh,
the kind of a social justice warrior as 

161
00:07:47,001 --> 00:07:47,834
you alluded to a pc politics on the left
and in particular the politics of 

162
00:07:51,861 --> 00:07:52,520
identity.

163
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:56,480
If you're going to push a politics of 
identity where apparently the only group

164
00:07:56,481 --> 00:08:00,500
who aren't allowed to have an identity 
are white working class men.

165
00:08:00,890 --> 00:08:03,410
Sooner or later those kinds of people 
are going to say,

166
00:08:03,411 --> 00:08:04,540
well,
hold on a minute.

167
00:08:04,580 --> 00:08:05,413
You know,
I have this identity to which you are 

168
00:08:06,771 --> 00:08:07,604
not respecting your own terms.
So there's a lot of pushback coming on 

169
00:08:10,251 --> 00:08:13,820
and I think that shows how really the 
response that liberals need to have,

170
00:08:13,910 --> 00:08:17,000
and I would include many people on the 
left in that category should be one way.

171
00:08:17,001 --> 00:08:17,834
You were certainly importance of 
individualism and the identity as being 

172
00:08:20,301 --> 00:08:24,770
something that to a great degree is 
personally chosen and formed rather than

173
00:08:24,771 --> 00:08:27,200
being something that's given to you.
And fixed in some way.

174
00:08:27,290 --> 00:08:28,123
Yeah,
I mean I love that and that's exactly 

175
00:08:29,061 --> 00:08:31,850
how my own evolution has happened over 
the last couple of years.

176
00:08:31,851 --> 00:08:32,684
Coming out of progressivism,
which is more about the collective to 

177
00:08:35,211 --> 00:08:36,044
ultimately realize I would only want to 
be judged by my own thoughts and my own 

178
00:08:39,681 --> 00:08:40,514
actions,
so let's circle back a little bit to to 

179
00:08:42,201 --> 00:08:44,210
Europe and then we'll do our elections.
Now we're getting some big stuff.

180
00:08:44,211 --> 00:08:48,290
So when it comes to the immigration 
situation all over Europe,

181
00:08:48,710 --> 00:08:49,543
I sense what you're saying is there's a 
certain natural reaction to people 

182
00:08:52,341 --> 00:08:56,190
coming in and not assimilating properly 
or whatever else.

183
00:08:56,190 --> 00:08:58,740
There may be the economic strains and 
all that stuff.

184
00:08:59,070 --> 00:08:59,903
What?
What is the proper solution for all 

185
00:09:01,930 --> 00:09:02,763
these countries now?
Because the cat's out of the bag 

186
00:09:03,631 --> 00:09:03,910
already,

187
00:09:03,910 --> 00:09:04,743
right?
Well actually a lot of the responses 

188
00:09:06,951 --> 00:09:08,870
misguided in my view because for 
example,

189
00:09:08,871 --> 00:09:09,704
there was a widespread perception 
feeling that immigration imposes costs 

190
00:09:12,891 --> 00:09:14,690
on the countries that the immigrants go 
to.

191
00:09:15,230 --> 00:09:18,020
All of the research I was actually.
This is not the case.

192
00:09:18,050 --> 00:09:18,883
Immigrants are actually extremely good 
news because typically they are younger 

193
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:24,680
than the host population.
They are almost always in work.

194
00:09:24,740 --> 00:09:27,680
They come to look for work,
they want to do productive labor,

195
00:09:27,770 --> 00:09:28,603
how can that be a problem you might say,
and so typically they are tax payers 

196
00:09:31,461 --> 00:09:32,294
rather than tax consumers.
They typically make a net contribution 

197
00:09:34,401 --> 00:09:35,234
to the budget.
They do not depress wages because 

198
00:09:37,011 --> 00:09:37,844
typically they do work that the 
indigenous population either can't or 

199
00:09:41,091 --> 00:09:43,100
won't do usually because they lack the 
skillset.

200
00:09:43,460 --> 00:09:44,293
They do have a marginal depressing 
effect on the wages of the bottom 10 

201
00:09:46,611 --> 00:09:48,860
percent of the income range,
but that's about it,

202
00:09:49,190 --> 00:09:50,023
but there's a widespread misconception 
or misunderstanding of what the 

203
00:09:52,851 --> 00:09:53,684
economics of immigration is actually a 
balance and that's a failure of public 

204
00:09:56,511 --> 00:09:57,500
education really.

205
00:09:57,800 --> 00:09:58,633
So that's part of it.
I think the more profound thing though 

206
00:10:01,370 --> 00:10:02,203
is a feeling that there's a threat to an
established indigenous culture and I 

207
00:10:05,571 --> 00:10:08,580
think the response here is to simply be 
more confident.

208
00:10:08,930 --> 00:10:09,763
I have enormous confidence in the 
Assembler to power of the culture of a 

209
00:10:12,681 --> 00:10:16,250
free society and I think the thing to do
is not to say,

210
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:17,113
okay,
here are people who are asserting a 

211
00:10:18,051 --> 00:10:23,051
particular collective cultural identity.
What we need to do is assert our own one

212
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:26,210
in response to that and aggressively 
against that verse one,

213
00:10:26,510 --> 00:10:27,343
the thing to do is to emphasize 
individualism and the degree to which 

214
00:10:29,751 --> 00:10:34,430
are modern free society is one where 
people are free to form that shape their

215
00:10:34,460 --> 00:10:35,293
own identity through the choices that 
they make and that should be true for 

216
00:10:37,791 --> 00:10:38,210
everybody.

217
00:10:38,210 --> 00:10:39,150
Right?
So in a way you're.

218
00:10:39,170 --> 00:10:40,003
You're looking at it in sort of the 
macro sense of are we should deal with 

219
00:10:42,891 --> 00:10:45,100
all this a certain amount of the people 
on the ground,

220
00:10:45,150 --> 00:10:48,600
they just don't see it that way because 
they see where you are.

221
00:10:48,601 --> 00:10:51,860
These people coming in,
even if the job thing is incorrect,

222
00:10:51,861 --> 00:10:53,360
they feel that their jobs are being 
taken.

223
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:55,640
So when I,
when I read stories about things like in

224
00:10:55,641 --> 00:10:56,474
Germany that I saw something that it was
going to cost one point 4 billion euros 

225
00:11:00,050 --> 00:11:03,500
to give the refugees or the migrants 
dental care,

226
00:11:03,650 --> 00:11:05,800
I mean these things are just not true.
Basically

227
00:11:06,670 --> 00:11:10,240
that isn't true.
If you look at the areas where there are

228
00:11:10,241 --> 00:11:13,690
problems,
these are all areas where it's the state

229
00:11:13,750 --> 00:11:14,583
that is in boulder as a major provider.
You do not see grocery stores panicking 

230
00:11:18,221 --> 00:11:19,054
because they suddenly have to find food 
products and other products for new 

231
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:23,433
customers on the country.
They look at it as a business 

232
00:11:25,001 --> 00:11:25,834
opportunity.
The private sector everywhere actually 

233
00:11:27,701 --> 00:11:29,800
sees large scale movement of people as 
being,

234
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:31,120
as I say,
an opportunity.

235
00:11:31,180 --> 00:11:32,013
Not a problem.
It's the areas where the state is 

236
00:11:33,731 --> 00:11:34,564
involved that you find problems.
And what that shows us is actually the 

237
00:11:37,970 --> 00:11:38,803
incompetence inefficiency of modern 
governments as compared to the private 

238
00:11:41,381 --> 00:11:42,214
sector.

239
00:11:42,270 --> 00:11:43,103
So even if we viewed everyone as the,
as the individual that we're going to 

240
00:11:46,381 --> 00:11:48,810
talk a lot about the individual here,
um,

241
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:50,153
do you think there's possibly something 
different with this wave of immigration 

242
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:54,513
related to terrorism and we know that 
there's a certain amount of people that 

243
00:11:57,821 --> 00:11:58,654
isis wants to infiltrate and cross 
borders that there is something 

244
00:12:01,391 --> 00:12:02,224
different about this.
Because even if all of us in the west 

245
00:12:04,991 --> 00:12:05,824
say it's about individualism and let's 
judge people individually and by their 

246
00:12:09,341 --> 00:12:13,240
actions and all those things.
If a certain amount of people don't want

247
00:12:13,241 --> 00:12:15,910
to assimilate what,
what do you do then?

248
00:12:16,190 --> 00:12:18,290
Well,
in in in one sense,

249
00:12:18,291 --> 00:12:19,124
not assimilating is not in and of itself
a problem where I live in Manchester 

250
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:24,320
then so well established Jewish 
community,

251
00:12:24,321 --> 00:12:26,740
been there since the 18,
eighties and nineties.

252
00:12:26,750 --> 00:12:29,480
These people are Hacidic Jews,
very strict,

253
00:12:29,510 --> 00:12:30,343
ultra orthodox.
A lot of them are lubavitch has 

254
00:12:31,491 --> 00:12:32,324
actually,
and they're not assimilated in some 

255
00:12:34,011 --> 00:12:35,510
sense.
It's totally never watched television,

256
00:12:35,511 --> 00:12:37,250
for example,
against their beliefs and sold,

257
00:12:37,610 --> 00:12:39,890
but nobody I think would regard that as 
a problem.

258
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:40,993
From my point of view.
It just means I've got a wonderful 

259
00:12:42,410 --> 00:12:44,990
bakery in May,
was fantastic bagels,

260
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:46,700
right?
The problem is,

261
00:12:46,701 --> 00:12:49,550
as you say,
the Association of a certain category of

262
00:12:49,551 --> 00:12:51,620
migrants from the Middle East with 
Islamic terrorism.

263
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:53,720
Now what's the best way to respond to 
that?

264
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:55,880
That is a difficult issue on my own 
view,

265
00:12:55,910 --> 00:12:59,540
very much is that the.
The ultimate solution is to try and sort

266
00:12:59,541 --> 00:13:02,700
out the complete mess at the Middle East
has become a,

267
00:13:02,750 --> 00:13:05,240
but in the short term,
essentially this is a policing problem.

268
00:13:05,330 --> 00:13:06,163
What you definitely don't want to think 
about is dealing with this as a problem 

269
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:11,540
of military security is essentially a 
law enforcement problem.

270
00:13:11,690 --> 00:13:12,523
Right?
So as someone that doesn't love state 

271
00:13:14,690 --> 00:13:15,523
power,
does it make you nervous that you have 

272
00:13:18,171 --> 00:13:19,004
to sort of give a certain amount of 
state power to the police or to the 

273
00:13:21,261 --> 00:13:22,094
border controls or whatever to actually 
make sure that they're doing the right 

274
00:13:24,141 --> 00:13:24,590
job?

275
00:13:24,590 --> 00:13:26,210
Yes,
I am nervous about that.

276
00:13:26,630 --> 00:13:27,463
And what I would say by the way is that 
the kind of increase in state 

277
00:13:30,351 --> 00:13:33,320
surveillance which has been put through 
in the United Kingdom,

278
00:13:33,321 --> 00:13:34,154
for example,
by our current prime minister when she 

279
00:13:35,121 --> 00:13:35,954
was in a previous job as home secretary,
is actually counterproductive in that 

280
00:13:38,451 --> 00:13:42,020
regard because basically if you think 
about the trust of the security services

281
00:13:42,021 --> 00:13:42,854
of golf,
they're looking for the proverbial 

282
00:13:43,881 --> 00:13:46,520
needle in a haystack.
So if that's the case,

283
00:13:46,580 --> 00:13:49,520
why do you then make the haystack even 
bigger?

284
00:13:49,610 --> 00:13:52,850
By intercepting virtually everybody's 
email.

285
00:13:52,851 --> 00:13:54,950
That actually makes our job more 
difficult,

286
00:13:54,951 --> 00:13:58,950
not easier.
And so I think that actually what really

287
00:13:58,951 --> 00:14:02,180
you need is good old fashioned 
undercover intelligence work,

288
00:14:02,181 --> 00:14:05,530
which means penetrating organizations.
Identifying key people,

289
00:14:05,540 --> 00:14:09,500
you basically try and keep an eye on and
good old fashioned spy work really.

290
00:14:09,590 --> 00:14:11,420
It's always going to work,
but that's the way to do it.

291
00:14:11,770 --> 00:14:15,880
It's interesting because you're making a
real argument for limited government and

292
00:14:15,881 --> 00:14:16,714
the slim trim government through,
through a prism that a lot of people 

293
00:14:20,771 --> 00:14:21,604
don't think of it.
They think we need big government to 

294
00:14:23,171 --> 00:14:24,004
protect us from things and,
and have surveillance and all of these 

295
00:14:26,711 --> 00:14:29,380
things that people that are for it,
but you're really making an argument for

296
00:14:29,381 --> 00:14:33,410
if you actually took a lot of that away,
might be a more efficient way of killing

297
00:14:33,420 --> 00:14:34,253
me.
It will be much more effective in my 

298
00:14:34,721 --> 00:14:35,554
view.
Huh.

299
00:14:35,650 --> 00:14:37,560
That's really interesting.
So let's,

300
00:14:37,580 --> 00:14:40,750
let's talk about brexit a little bit 
because I did a little bit of it on this

301
00:14:40,751 --> 00:14:41,890
show and uh,
you know,

302
00:14:41,891 --> 00:14:42,724
I'm constantly talking about how our 
American media doesn't give us much of 

303
00:14:45,671 --> 00:14:47,740
anything.
So we didn't hear about it at all.

304
00:14:47,741 --> 00:14:49,900
Then two days before everybody was 
freaking out about it.

305
00:14:49,901 --> 00:14:52,040
We saw it on twitter,
then it happened that we don't talk

306
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:52,873
about it again.
Yeah.

307
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:55,520
So for people that have no idea what 
happened,

308
00:14:55,521 --> 00:14:57,670
can you just give me a little history of
it and then,

309
00:14:57,780 --> 00:15:01,160
and then where we're at now,
Britain's relationship with the European

310
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:02,870
Union has always been,
I think,

311
00:15:02,900 --> 00:15:03,733
a bit fraught and difficult.
It's been like one of those unhappy 

312
00:15:06,651 --> 00:15:07,550
marriages,
if you will,

313
00:15:07,551 --> 00:15:10,520
were outside just wonder why all those 
two people together.

314
00:15:10,900 --> 00:15:11,733
Uh,
the reason being that British 

315
00:15:12,561 --> 00:15:13,394
politicians on the British public ever 
since we first joined the European 

316
00:15:16,790 --> 00:15:17,623
Economic Community,
sees that then was in 1973 have always 

317
00:15:19,281 --> 00:15:20,114
seen as being basically about economics.
It's all about getting economic 

318
00:15:22,521 --> 00:15:23,354
advantage on the constant after they'd 
been equally clan right since the 

319
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:27,233
Messina conference in 1954.
But this is all about building a 

320
00:15:30,441 --> 00:15:31,274
political union.
So they see it as part of the kind of 

321
00:15:33,711 --> 00:15:36,770
grand political project.
And the British politicians always say,

322
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:37,633
oh,
they don't really mean that these 

323
00:15:38,541 --> 00:15:39,374
continentals this is just rhetoric,
which of course is actually quite 

324
00:15:41,361 --> 00:15:42,010
offensive.

325
00:15:42,010 --> 00:15:42,843
And not surprisingly,
the continentals get a bit irritated by 

326
00:15:44,691 --> 00:15:45,524
this attitude.
So essentially there's a growing 

327
00:15:47,451 --> 00:15:50,480
mismatch between what the British public
think the EU should be.

328
00:15:50,510 --> 00:15:54,380
And the actual nature of that project,
and that's got significantly worse since

329
00:15:54,381 --> 00:15:55,214
the Maastricht treaty,
so it caused all kinds of internal 

330
00:15:57,261 --> 00:16:00,920
political reactions and David Cameron in
what I have to say.

331
00:16:00,921 --> 00:16:01,754
It was a grotesque act of misjudgment 
from his own perspective called a 

332
00:16:04,881 --> 00:16:07,520
referendum to try and sort out his 
internal politics.

333
00:16:07,820 --> 00:16:08,653
And now in that referendum,
everyone thought the expectation was 

334
00:16:11,451 --> 00:16:13,880
that the status quo would win.
I must say I expected that.

335
00:16:13,881 --> 00:16:16,310
So that's basically why he called it 
because he was empowering,

336
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:17,030
figured out,
call it,

337
00:16:17,030 --> 00:16:19,570
they'll agree with me and that'll sort 
out my party problem.

338
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:20,513
That's because generally speaking,
referenda normally go for the status 

339
00:16:24,141 --> 00:16:26,270
quo.
And in this case,

340
00:16:26,420 --> 00:16:28,730
the overwhelming majority of members of 
parliament,

341
00:16:28,940 --> 00:16:32,390
most of the respected pundits,
most economists,

342
00:16:32,630 --> 00:16:37,160
virtually all of the big business firms 
that were asked the Bank of England,

343
00:16:37,161 --> 00:16:39,440
pretty much any authority figure you 
care to mention said,

344
00:16:39,441 --> 00:16:40,790
yes,
you need to vote remain.

345
00:16:41,090 --> 00:16:41,923
So what took place was a popular 
insurgency and in which the ordinary 

346
00:16:44,781 --> 00:16:45,980
British public thought,
well,

347
00:16:46,250 --> 00:16:47,300
no,
we don't agree with this.

348
00:16:47,540 --> 00:16:48,373
And they basically went against the 
advice of the bulk of the political 

349
00:16:51,710 --> 00:16:52,543
media business leadership.
Now the vote that came together to a 

350
00:16:56,630 --> 00:16:57,920
vote leave,
if you will,

351
00:16:57,950 --> 00:17:01,340
was basically a coalition of three quite
distinct groups.

352
00:17:01,341 --> 00:17:05,380
I think on the one hand you had what you
might call Brexit Shyer.

353
00:17:05,690 --> 00:17:09,650
A older conservative voters,
typically a middleclass,

354
00:17:09,651 --> 00:17:11,570
slightly older,
living in the countryside,

355
00:17:11,571 --> 00:17:14,300
living in the affluent suburbs,
and that's one block.

356
00:17:14,360 --> 00:17:17,060
So that's a little bit of the people 
that you described voting for trump.

357
00:17:17,061 --> 00:17:20,120
It's a little bit,
slightly more moderate.

358
00:17:20,150 --> 00:17:21,350
The second group,
however,

359
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:25,430
Arlette people who voted for trump,
this is older white working class voters

360
00:17:25,460 --> 00:17:28,700
in the traditional labour heartlands of 
the northeast of England,

361
00:17:28,790 --> 00:17:30,170
the Midlands,
Yorkshire,

362
00:17:30,470 --> 00:17:31,303
the voting,
some constituencies that like 

363
00:17:32,230 --> 00:17:33,063
Sunderland,
which is our current of say scratch and 

364
00:17:34,671 --> 00:17:35,504
Wilkes Barre.

365
00:17:35,660 --> 00:17:40,660
That was a 69 percent vote for leave,
an absolute landslide.

366
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:45,050
And that was,
it was that block of what you might call

367
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:50,200
a populist voters working class that put
leave over.

368
00:17:51,270 --> 00:17:53,160
The third very small group,
which I belong to,

369
00:17:53,490 --> 00:17:56,790
is what you might call radical classical
liberals who are very small group.

370
00:17:56,791 --> 00:17:57,624
But again,
you could say we made the difference in 

371
00:17:58,561 --> 00:17:59,394
some ways because what we wanted to us 
to be able to have a greater range of 

372
00:18:01,921 --> 00:18:05,960
options for the British government by 
being outside of the year,

373
00:18:05,961 --> 00:18:06,794
use controls and constraints.
So there's those three blocks of people 

374
00:18:09,781 --> 00:18:11,370
that voted for leave basically.

375
00:18:11,430 --> 00:18:12,263
Yeah.
I like radical classical liberals 

376
00:18:13,651 --> 00:18:14,910
because I've been saying classical 
liberals.

377
00:18:14,911 --> 00:18:15,744
It sounds too to benign or something.
Radical has a little something extra 

378
00:18:18,841 --> 00:18:19,890
there.
So.

379
00:18:19,891 --> 00:18:21,270
Okay.
So when it was happening and you,

380
00:18:21,271 --> 00:18:24,270
you say you were part of this,
uh,

381
00:18:24,570 --> 00:18:28,200
did you expect the vote to go that way?
Because as you're saying,

382
00:18:28,201 --> 00:18:30,600
the entire establishment was saying,
don't do it.

383
00:18:30,601 --> 00:18:31,434
It's not going to happen.
The polls were showing it wasn't going 

384
00:18:32,571 --> 00:18:33,000
to happen.

385
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:33,833
No,
I always thought it was going to be 

386
00:18:34,381 --> 00:18:35,214
tight.
But my own expectation was that it was 

387
00:18:36,511 --> 00:18:37,344
going to be about 51 percent remained to
49 percent leave because normally in 

388
00:18:43,321 --> 00:18:44,154
referenda like this,
the undecided voters who make up their 

389
00:18:46,171 --> 00:18:48,630
mind at the last minute split to two,
one for the status quo.

390
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:50,970
Now,
I actually think they did here.

391
00:18:50,971 --> 00:18:51,804
But what happened was that the polls d 
underestimated the leaves share of the 

392
00:18:56,161 --> 00:18:59,460
vote by about five percent.
The reason being a lot of the people who

393
00:18:59,461 --> 00:19:02,040
voted leave are people who did not 
normally vote,

394
00:19:02,430 --> 00:19:06,360
and pollsters always discount people who
say that they don't vote,

395
00:19:06,630 --> 00:19:09,660
so they got their sampling wrong,
and so they underestimated the,

396
00:19:09,661 --> 00:19:10,494
the,
the share of the vote that leaves going 

397
00:19:11,491 --> 00:19:11,980
to get.

398
00:19:11,980 --> 00:19:15,610
So looping this back to trump,
because I see such parallels here,

399
00:19:16,270 --> 00:19:18,430
I suspect the exact same thing is gonna 
happen.

400
00:19:18,431 --> 00:19:19,264
I'm not saying trump's going gonna win,
but I do suspect there a depression in 

401
00:19:21,971 --> 00:19:22,804
the polls because a certain amount of 
his supporters now either aren't being 

402
00:19:26,261 --> 00:19:27,094
pulled for whatever they're in places 
that they're not polling or they don't 

403
00:19:29,291 --> 00:19:30,970
want.
They don't want to be publicly shamed or

404
00:19:30,971 --> 00:19:33,610
admitted or something like that.
So I sent that.

405
00:19:33,611 --> 00:19:37,240
What you're talking about here,
this groundswell of support that was not

406
00:19:37,241 --> 00:19:38,580
spoken of,
I,

407
00:19:38,581 --> 00:19:40,600
I suspect that's happening right now.
Do you think that's fair?

408
00:19:40,601 --> 00:19:40,740
Right?

409
00:19:40,740 --> 00:19:41,573
Do think so?
I think there's two things going on 

410
00:19:43,081 --> 00:19:43,914
there.
One is what century here in Los Angeles 

411
00:19:45,421 --> 00:19:46,254
needs is known as the Tom Bradley,
if people are not honest in the answers 

412
00:19:49,051 --> 00:19:50,680
that gives the pollsters,
uh,

413
00:19:50,700 --> 00:19:51,533
but also I think that actually the 
pollsters samples are probably slightly 

414
00:19:53,641 --> 00:19:55,110
wrong.
They're probably a,

415
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:56,033
not counting the correct number of trump
voters because one of the things he did 

416
00:19:58,651 --> 00:20:02,700
during the primaries was to bring a 
record number of people into the primary

417
00:20:02,701 --> 00:20:05,370
process who had never voted before.
Now,

418
00:20:05,371 --> 00:20:06,204
what I suspect that means is he's going 
to be much more competitive than it 

419
00:20:08,581 --> 00:20:11,430
currently appears to be in states like 
Ohio,

420
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:12,880
Pennsylvania,
uh,

421
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:13,793
maybe even Michigan and Arizona where I 
think there's a significant number of 

422
00:20:17,641 --> 00:20:20,160
people who have not voted before who 
will vote.

423
00:20:20,380 --> 00:20:21,213
Yeah.
What do you make of when you see Nigel 

424
00:20:22,121 --> 00:20:24,700
farrage come here and speak at trump 
rallies?

425
00:20:24,970 --> 00:20:25,803
W,
what do you make of the connection 

426
00:20:26,501 --> 00:20:28,080
between the two of them?
And,

427
00:20:28,220 --> 00:20:30,040
and is this really,
you know,

428
00:20:30,041 --> 00:20:34,070
if when I click on info wars,
a link or some of the other things,

429
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:35,260
the more right things,
Breitbart,

430
00:20:35,560 --> 00:20:37,900
that really they're fighting the 
globalists,

431
00:20:37,930 --> 00:20:38,763
the globalists are coming here.
I think there's some degree to a one 

432
00:20:42,310 --> 00:20:44,950
world government thing that's trying to 
formulate,

433
00:20:44,951 --> 00:20:47,410
but like how much it feels so 
conspiratorial.

434
00:20:47,900 --> 00:20:48,110
Well,

435
00:20:48,110 --> 00:20:51,190
I that that's exactly the kind of 
alignment that I was talking about these

436
00:20:51,310 --> 00:20:53,650
books,
but Nigel farage and Ukip in the UK,

437
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:54,513
Donald trump hair,
that part of the nationalist reaction 

438
00:20:56,440 --> 00:20:57,273
against the increased cosmopolitanism 
globalization that we've seen in the 

439
00:21:00,461 --> 00:21:02,470
last 20 to 30 years.
Uh,

440
00:21:02,510 --> 00:21:03,343
there's a feeling that this 
transnational organizations that are 

441
00:21:04,961 --> 00:21:05,794
pushing an agenda they don't like,
but basically it's more a kind of 

442
00:21:08,140 --> 00:21:11,800
localism or hostility to cosmopolitanism
and to globalism.

443
00:21:11,801 --> 00:21:13,300
And you see that on both sides of the 
Atlantic.

444
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:15,460
Now.
That's a politics I strongly reject.

445
00:21:15,461 --> 00:21:17,800
But you can't deny the reality of the 
existence of it.

446
00:21:17,860 --> 00:21:19,450
Yeah.
And that's what makes it so hard to talk

447
00:21:19,451 --> 00:21:22,000
about because it's not fun to talk about
something you reject,

448
00:21:22,001 --> 00:21:23,440
but no,
to be honest,

449
00:21:23,441 --> 00:21:26,500
to be a classical liberal,
you have to acknowledge that something's

450
00:21:26,530 --> 00:21:30,040
happening,
which is it's no point in ignoring this.

451
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:33,220
Maybe if you disagree with something,
with a belief that a lot of people have,

452
00:21:33,460 --> 00:21:34,293
the thing to do is to engage with it 
when you have to do is to actually talk 

453
00:21:36,251 --> 00:21:37,660
to these people,
respect their views,

454
00:21:37,661 --> 00:21:41,110
but show them that you think they are 
mistaken and here's why that mistake.

455
00:21:41,320 --> 00:21:42,051
Yeah.
Okay,

456
00:21:42,051 --> 00:21:43,890
so now brexit happens.
Yeah.

457
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:46,600
Everyone said the next day the markets 
are going to crash,

458
00:21:46,601 --> 00:21:48,470
the economy is going to crash,
everything will be over.

459
00:21:48,490 --> 00:21:50,970
We're going to be fighting for bread or 
have you had red light?

460
00:21:51,090 --> 00:21:51,923
No,
no,

461
00:21:53,350 --> 00:21:54,420
no problem.
The.

462
00:21:55,030 --> 00:21:57,100
I think we're still the funding goal 
stage right now.

463
00:21:57,160 --> 00:21:57,993
I think this going to be an enormous and
quite serious political route with the 

464
00:22:00,730 --> 00:22:02,560
United Kingdom the next few months.
The big question that was,

465
00:22:02,561 --> 00:22:03,430
okay,
what do we do?

466
00:22:03,970 --> 00:22:07,180
And there are really two routes that the
British government can take quite simply

467
00:22:07,300 --> 00:22:08,133
to simplify it.

468
00:22:08,290 --> 00:22:11,410
One is they can go for what's a 
membership of what's called the European

469
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:12,273
economic area,
which means that we would be a bit like 

470
00:22:13,931 --> 00:22:14,830
Norway.
Now.

471
00:22:14,831 --> 00:22:18,100
That means we would have access to the 
European single market regime,

472
00:22:19,420 --> 00:22:20,253
but we will still be bound by lots of EU
regulations while no longer having any 

473
00:22:23,141 --> 00:22:25,450
say in how,
what they were or how they were formed.

474
00:22:25,451 --> 00:22:26,284
So that's sort,
sorta like,

475
00:22:26,780 --> 00:22:28,690
that's sort of like staying in the EU 
but light.

476
00:22:28,970 --> 00:22:30,100
Exactly,
exactly.

477
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:31,150
And the,
um,

478
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:32,680
uh,
the thing,

479
00:22:32,710 --> 00:22:34,600
the other alternative is to say,
well,

480
00:22:34,601 --> 00:22:35,434
we don't want to do that.
We basically wanted negotiate a free 

481
00:22:37,811 --> 00:22:38,644
trade deal with the Aau.
The trouble is that wants to resume my 

482
00:22:40,701 --> 00:22:41,534
triggers,
what's called article 50 of the Lisbon 

483
00:22:42,761 --> 00:22:44,650
Treaty,
which is the withdrawal process.

484
00:22:44,830 --> 00:22:45,663
It's got a strict two year limit and 
it's not clear that you can negotiate a 

485
00:22:47,891 --> 00:22:50,410
two year,
a free trade deal in just two years.

486
00:22:50,740 --> 00:22:51,573
So that would throw us back a pot just 
membership of the World Trade 

487
00:22:55,510 --> 00:22:56,343
Organization,
which means that will then be a six and 

488
00:22:57,041 --> 00:22:59,110
a half percent tarriff between Britain 
and Europe.

489
00:22:59,350 --> 00:23:00,183
Now,
that's probably more than compensated 

490
00:23:02,141 --> 00:23:04,690
for by the decline in the value of the 
pound that's taken place,

491
00:23:04,691 --> 00:23:06,790
but it's still not,
not very welcome.

492
00:23:07,810 --> 00:23:10,450
Now the the critical political thing is 
the city of London,

493
00:23:11,020 --> 00:23:15,100
a seven percent of British GDP would 
lose its passporting rights.

494
00:23:15,250 --> 00:23:19,180
It would not be able to do euro 
denominated business unless we're in the

495
00:23:19,181 --> 00:23:20,014
European economic area.
The problem politically for Theresa May 

496
00:23:23,441 --> 00:23:27,430
and the government is that the Europeans
have been very reasonably in what you're

497
00:23:27,431 --> 00:23:28,264
saying,
look,

498
00:23:28,360 --> 00:23:29,193
if you become member of the EA,
you have to accept free movement of 

499
00:23:31,661 --> 00:23:33,100
Labor.
That's part of the deal.

500
00:23:33,130 --> 00:23:36,700
You don't cherry pick your conditions,
which seems perfectly reasonable to me,

501
00:23:36,910 --> 00:23:38,710
and the problem is that for political 
reasons,

502
00:23:38,711 --> 00:23:39,544
because so many of the people who voted 
leave did so on anti immigration 

503
00:23:43,061 --> 00:23:43,870
grounds.

504
00:23:43,870 --> 00:23:46,450
She is not all of them,
but a significant portion of them.

505
00:23:46,510 --> 00:23:49,700
Sure she's not prepared to do that,
and so the result is that they have,

506
00:23:49,710 --> 00:23:50,543
it looks like we're going to actually 
not applied to join the eea effectively 

507
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:56,450
and that's going to cause enormous 
political ructions.

508
00:23:56,510 --> 00:23:57,343
Now in the longer term,
I think the British economy will do 

509
00:23:58,971 --> 00:24:01,070
fine.
There may be some,

510
00:24:01,310 --> 00:24:03,470
some will be some losers,
probably the city of London.

511
00:24:03,620 --> 00:24:06,410
There'll be some gangers though,
a manufacturers in particular,

512
00:24:06,540 --> 00:24:11,330
an export as consumers because the price
of goods like food will go down,

513
00:24:11,690 --> 00:24:13,250
it'll even out it's a bit of a wash 
ready,

514
00:24:13,251 --> 00:24:15,800
but in the short term is going to be 
quite a lot of political fireworks,

515
00:24:16,130 --> 00:24:16,963
so all that being said aren't those 
subtle reasons that brexit was actually 

516
00:24:20,661 --> 00:24:21,494
the right decision because you guys 
still have to sort of negotiate things 

517
00:24:26,150 --> 00:24:31,150
with the EU in a weird way that allow 
them to have power over you and that was

518
00:24:31,461 --> 00:24:32,820
what the whole purpose of leading way.

519
00:24:33,080 --> 00:24:33,913
So in a way it's like better to do it 
now than 10 years when a lot of this 

520
00:24:37,671 --> 00:24:39,360
stuff has even been tight.
Absolutely.

521
00:24:39,361 --> 00:24:41,450
Absolutely.
I mean the point is what brexit does,

522
00:24:41,451 --> 00:24:43,400
and this was my main reason for voting 
for.

523
00:24:43,401 --> 00:24:45,690
I wasn't passionate lever,
but I did vote leave the end.

524
00:24:46,070 --> 00:24:46,903
The main reasons for doing it is that it
increases the range of political 

525
00:24:48,921 --> 00:24:49,754
possibilities open to the British 
electorate and the British government 

526
00:24:51,410 --> 00:24:52,243
for both good and bad.
Right now they're highly constrained 

527
00:24:54,920 --> 00:24:55,753
because a whole lot of radical policies 
on both left and right would fall foul 

528
00:24:59,210 --> 00:25:00,043
of the EU zone rules and regulations,
so there's actually a very narrow range 

529
00:25:02,871 --> 00:25:03,704
of what is allowable politically now 
that we have left the a year or once 

530
00:25:07,671 --> 00:25:09,830
we've left a year ago.
It becomes much wider.

531
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:12,440
Whole range of options are opened up 
now.

532
00:25:12,590 --> 00:25:16,790
The job for me then is to argue for the 
right wants to be really bad ones.

533
00:25:17,210 --> 00:25:17,880
Your,
your,

534
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:19,760
your job just started.
Exactly.

535
00:25:19,761 --> 00:25:20,594
Yes.
But that's,

536
00:25:20,630 --> 00:25:21,463
so that's my main reason for doing it 
and I think there are much greater 

537
00:25:23,211 --> 00:25:25,120
options open to us now in the future.
Yeah.

538
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:29,480
Do you sense that the EU as a,
as a entity is really in trouble?

539
00:25:29,481 --> 00:25:30,314
I mean,
everything beyond what just happened 

540
00:25:31,431 --> 00:25:32,840
with,
with you guys.

541
00:25:32,841 --> 00:25:36,500
I mean they've got grease basically in a
hostage situation,

542
00:25:36,501 --> 00:25:37,400
right?
I mean is that,

543
00:25:37,401 --> 00:25:39,120
am I being too?
No.

544
00:25:39,950 --> 00:25:41,380
Greeks would agree with.
Yeah.

545
00:25:41,450 --> 00:25:42,283
I mean,
so what do you think the future here is 

546
00:25:43,671 --> 00:25:44,504
you have,
you have,

547
00:25:44,690 --> 00:25:46,370
you know,
Britain leaving,

548
00:25:46,371 --> 00:25:48,500
you've got grease in a hostage 
situation.

549
00:25:48,501 --> 00:25:49,334
I mean,
ultimately the borders that are 

550
00:25:50,361 --> 00:25:52,640
crumbling people aren't happy with.
Well,

551
00:25:52,670 --> 00:25:56,690
the real problem that the EU faces is 
the incredible act of Hubris they did at

552
00:25:56,691 --> 00:25:57,524
the master treaty,
which is to create a single currency 

553
00:25:58,970 --> 00:26:00,650
when they don't have a single 
government.

554
00:26:00,710 --> 00:26:02,210
Now,
interestingly,

555
00:26:02,540 --> 00:26:05,210
pretty much every economist on the 
planet at the time,

556
00:26:05,240 --> 00:26:10,240
regardless of their politics,
said that this was a really bad idea and

557
00:26:10,431 --> 00:26:12,590
they all thought it was a bad idea for 
the same reason,

558
00:26:12,620 --> 00:26:13,453
which is that there's no historical case
ever have a single currency area that 

559
00:26:17,751 --> 00:26:20,930
doesn't have a single government 
surviving,

560
00:26:21,460 --> 00:26:22,293
and if you do have a single currency 
area in countries that are not 

561
00:26:24,890 --> 00:26:26,810
economically aligned,
if you will,

562
00:26:27,050 --> 00:26:29,750
and you don't have a single government,
all kinds of really bad stuff happens.

563
00:26:29,751 --> 00:26:31,710
Paul trible and Milton Friedman in the 
same way,

564
00:26:32,210 --> 00:26:33,043
made almost exactly the same point that 
they ignore the advice from all the 

565
00:26:37,731 --> 00:26:40,100
economists as portraying when rather 
which Lee put it.

566
00:26:40,430 --> 00:26:42,680
A.
The good news is we know now the optimal

567
00:26:42,681 --> 00:26:44,760
currency area theory is completely 
correct.

568
00:26:44,940 --> 00:26:45,773
The bad news is we've had to bugger up 
the economy of a continent to figure it 

569
00:26:49,201 --> 00:26:49,870
out,
figure it out,

570
00:26:49,870 --> 00:26:51,470
approve it,
so the point is they.

571
00:26:51,540 --> 00:26:52,830
They still haven't resolved that 
problem.

572
00:26:52,920 --> 00:26:55,080
Now,
Greece is a small country.

573
00:26:55,140 --> 00:26:56,970
They can handle Greece.
What if Italy goes under,

574
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:00,390
which is quite likely the Italian 
banking system is in really,

575
00:27:00,391 --> 00:27:01,224
really bad shape.
If there's a major crisis in Italy or 

576
00:27:03,811 --> 00:27:06,330
maybe in France or some other larger 
country,

577
00:27:06,540 --> 00:27:07,373
they won't be able to resolve it,
so they're going to have to either 

578
00:27:08,941 --> 00:27:09,774
create something like a government for 
the euro zone or they're going to have 

579
00:27:12,781 --> 00:27:15,720
to allow the euro to be dismantled and 
either of those as a huge event.

580
00:27:15,930 --> 00:27:16,763
Plus there's an election next spring in 
France and there's a pretty reasonable 

581
00:27:21,361 --> 00:27:24,000
chance that marine Le Pen will win the 
election.

582
00:27:25,020 --> 00:27:27,570
If she's up against one candidate from a
center,

583
00:27:27,571 --> 00:27:28,404
right Alan page,
she will lose if she's up against the 

584
00:27:30,571 --> 00:27:32,060
former president,
Sarkozy,

585
00:27:32,190 --> 00:27:33,390
the polls show,
it's very,

586
00:27:33,391 --> 00:27:36,150
very close and I would actually take her
to beat him,

587
00:27:36,330 --> 00:27:36,570
right?

588
00:27:36,570 --> 00:27:37,403
Because that could be one of the 
situations where the Poles are going to 

589
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:40,233
hate her.
Plus also these polls now before 

590
00:27:41,700 --> 00:27:44,940
campaign,
she's a very effective campaigner and so

591
00:27:45,150 --> 00:27:48,900
I think she could beat their rival 
candidate if it's Sarkozy.

592
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:50,033
Now,
if she became president mean the odds 

593
00:27:51,271 --> 00:27:52,980
are still against that.
But if she did,

594
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:56,670
she said she'd immediately call a 
referendum on France leaving the EU.

595
00:27:57,060 --> 00:27:57,893
Now all the Poles there indicates 65 
percent of the French public would vote 

596
00:28:00,541 --> 00:28:03,030
leave.
Now if that happens,

597
00:28:03,270 --> 00:28:04,780
the Aau is finished.
That's it.

598
00:28:05,460 --> 00:28:07,290
It's done full.
So it's in really bad.

599
00:28:07,291 --> 00:28:08,940
It's an a very tricky situation right 
now.

600
00:28:08,941 --> 00:28:11,010
The EU.
So for someone like yourself,

601
00:28:11,011 --> 00:28:12,480
again,
classical liberal,

602
00:28:12,660 --> 00:28:14,700
and you want this to be about the 
individuals.

603
00:28:14,760 --> 00:28:18,630
So I can understand the separation.
Why you think ultimately this is good.

604
00:28:19,410 --> 00:28:23,010
It seems like in a weird way,
you then have to align yourself with the

605
00:28:23,011 --> 00:28:24,840
Marie Le Pen's,
with the,

606
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:25,800
uh,
you know,

607
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:26,633
you end up by default falling into a 
category with the people that want to 

608
00:28:30,211 --> 00:28:32,100
leave the event with the nationalist 
street.

609
00:28:32,100 --> 00:28:33,840
But it,
but I don't sense that you have.

610
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:36,300
So how does that,
how do you negotiate that with yourself,

611
00:28:36,330 --> 00:28:38,640
with great difficulty?
This is the big problem.

612
00:28:38,641 --> 00:28:42,990
The problem for many classical liberals 
in the UK was if we vote leave,

613
00:28:43,020 --> 00:28:43,853
will this not give a big boost to 
precisely the kind of politics that you 

614
00:28:45,931 --> 00:28:48,270
most dislike?
That was the argument desert.

615
00:28:48,280 --> 00:28:50,020
My colleagues for example.
Uh,

616
00:28:50,110 --> 00:28:51,590
I think that,
uh,

617
00:28:51,660 --> 00:28:55,590
basically you have to realize if things 
like this happen,

618
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:56,513
you are going to be alongside a bunch of
people that otherwise you totally 

619
00:28:59,341 --> 00:29:01,950
detest.
And what you then have to do is to argue

620
00:29:01,951 --> 00:29:03,630
the case very,
very strongly against them.

621
00:29:03,870 --> 00:29:08,220
Now the crucial thing here I think is 
for liberals both left and right of you,

622
00:29:08,221 --> 00:29:11,940
well classical liberals and social 
liberals to come together and to realize

623
00:29:12,210 --> 00:29:15,030
that they have a common photos,
if you will,

624
00:29:15,060 --> 00:29:16,800
in the shape of the national 
collectivists.

625
00:29:17,220 --> 00:29:19,980
And on the other hand,
the radical radical left.

626
00:29:20,430 --> 00:29:22,500
And so here in the United States for 
example,

627
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:26,520
I think it's quite likely that there may
well be a kind of a proximal in the next

628
00:29:26,520 --> 00:29:29,070
few years between the kind of moderate 
part of the Republican Party.

629
00:29:29,071 --> 00:29:29,904
So called,
which is actually many ways the more 

630
00:29:30,691 --> 00:29:32,790
libertarian part,
fiscally conservative,

631
00:29:32,791 --> 00:29:35,130
but socially liberal you will,
and on the other hand,

632
00:29:35,131 --> 00:29:37,090
the mainstream of the Democrats,
uh,

633
00:29:37,091 --> 00:29:37,924
and this will be aimed at both the kind 
of people who are now voting for trump 

634
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:44,040
and also the kind of people who were 
supporting Bernie Sanders earlier on.

635
00:29:44,041 --> 00:29:44,190
Okay.

636
00:29:44,190 --> 00:29:45,023
The primary.
So I know this is this political 

637
00:29:46,291 --> 00:29:48,450
realignment is one of the things you've 
been talking about lately.

638
00:29:48,451 --> 00:29:51,630
And I love that because that's exactly 
what I've been trying to talk about,

639
00:29:51,631 --> 00:29:54,210
that I no longer as a,
as a classical liberal,

640
00:29:54,450 --> 00:29:55,283
I don't really see conservatives as my 
enemy as maybe five years ago I might 

641
00:29:58,681 --> 00:30:00,690
have thought that they would be where 
now it's like,

642
00:30:00,691 --> 00:30:01,524
yeah,
we can have some disagreements about 

643
00:30:02,641 --> 00:30:07,340
taxes and maybe we're not in the exact 
place related to abortion or a series of

644
00:30:07,390 --> 00:30:08,223
states rights or whatever,
but there has to be a new center 

645
00:30:11,401 --> 00:30:12,234
developing here.
Otherwise a lot of classical liberals 

646
00:30:14,461 --> 00:30:16,510
will end up going this,
you know,

647
00:30:16,511 --> 00:30:18,840
the Libertarians will end up going 
further to the right.

648
00:30:18,841 --> 00:30:21,230
Classical liberals may go further left 
and that that's not good for.

649
00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:21,410
Yeah,

650
00:30:21,410 --> 00:30:23,750
well indeed.
The way to think of is this,

651
00:30:23,751 --> 00:30:24,584
I think since about the 19 seventies,
the big argument in politics on both 

652
00:30:27,741 --> 00:30:29,870
sides of the Atlantic,
but particularly here in the US has been

653
00:30:29,871 --> 00:30:30,704
between one group of people who are 
economically interventionists in the 

654
00:30:33,281 --> 00:30:34,114
gala Cesarean,
but socially liberal versus another 

655
00:30:36,321 --> 00:30:37,154
group who appropriate market,
but socially and culturally 

656
00:30:38,781 --> 00:30:40,670
conservative.
That's been the big division.

657
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:44,510
What I think we're now moving towards 
this is a situation where they divide is

658
00:30:44,511 --> 00:30:47,960
between one group of people who are 
broadly free market,

659
00:30:48,260 --> 00:30:50,510
broadly individualists,
globalist,

660
00:30:50,660 --> 00:30:52,850
perhaps a bit more egalitarian than the 
classical liberals would like,

661
00:30:52,851 --> 00:30:56,790
but broadly liberal versus another group
which is the national collective.

662
00:30:56,791 --> 00:30:59,690
It's I mentioned earlier who are 
actually economically interventionists,

663
00:30:59,691 --> 00:31:03,200
pro welfare state,
but very culturally conservative,

664
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:05,480
quite authoritarian,
anti globalist,

665
00:31:05,740 --> 00:31:06,573
a anti cosmopolitan,
and that's the new division I think 

666
00:31:09,351 --> 00:31:12,560
we're seeing in politics everywhere and 
what that means is that all a lot of the

667
00:31:12,561 --> 00:31:14,420
existing subgroups are going to split 
up,

668
00:31:14,421 --> 00:31:16,370
so conservatives are going to have to 
decide,

669
00:31:16,371 --> 00:31:17,060
well,
okay,

670
00:31:17,060 --> 00:31:17,960
what is more important to you?

671
00:31:17,960 --> 00:31:18,793
The cultural conservatism and the 
nationalism or the free markets and the 

672
00:31:22,370 --> 00:31:24,730
individualism and if you're on the left 
you have to decide,

673
00:31:24,740 --> 00:31:25,191
well,
okay,

674
00:31:25,191 --> 00:31:26,024
what am I really more interested in a.
and if you're one of the kind of 

675
00:31:28,700 --> 00:31:31,760
identity Marion anti globalist left,
you actually may find yourself thinking,

676
00:31:31,761 --> 00:31:34,850
well actually right now I've got.
I've probably got more in common in some

677
00:31:34,851 --> 00:31:38,660
ways with this kind of new emerging 
Hamiltonian nationalist politics.

678
00:31:38,870 --> 00:31:43,790
If on the other hand you really value 
individual liberty and globalism,

679
00:31:43,850 --> 00:31:44,683
openness to the rest of the world,
then you're going to find yourself 

680
00:31:45,980 --> 00:31:48,780
making alliances with these other people
who were forming your opponent.

681
00:31:48,781 --> 00:31:49,614
So I think this is kind of big shuffling
of the deck going on in most Western 

682
00:31:51,621 --> 00:31:52,290
democracies.

683
00:31:52,290 --> 00:31:55,230
So as a historian,
what can you think of another time where

684
00:31:55,231 --> 00:31:56,064
we had such a,
maybe not on a global scale because 

685
00:31:58,021 --> 00:31:58,854
we're so connected now,
but where you saw just these real 

686
00:32:02,371 --> 00:32:03,204
fractures happening in real time.
Like when's the last time you saw 

687
00:32:05,620 --> 00:32:06,380
something?

688
00:32:06,380 --> 00:32:08,090
Well,
the last time it happened in the UK,

689
00:32:08,091 --> 00:32:08,924
certainly it was in the 19 sixties in 
1970 and I think something like that 

690
00:32:11,421 --> 00:32:13,160
happened over here in the United States 
as well,

691
00:32:13,161 --> 00:32:13,994
where you had this sudden reversal where
the south went from being solidly 

692
00:32:18,021 --> 00:32:18,854
democratic where you know if you found 
two Republican votes that countered it 

693
00:32:22,310 --> 00:32:23,143
must have voted twice to the situation 
we have now where the south is solidly 

694
00:32:26,541 --> 00:32:29,870
Republican and Democrats will become the
party of the north entirely.

695
00:32:30,410 --> 00:32:32,990
That kind of switched took place then in
the sixties and seventies.

696
00:32:32,991 --> 00:32:33,824
Similarly in the UK,
back in the eighties and nineties here 

697
00:32:36,261 --> 00:32:38,540
in the United States with William 
Jennings Bryan,

698
00:32:38,541 --> 00:32:39,374
the cross of and the famous Democratic 
convention in Nineteen Ninety six when 

699
00:32:42,441 --> 00:32:44,870
the populous basically took over the 
Democratic Party,

700
00:32:45,110 --> 00:32:48,320
major change in the nature of the 
Democratic Party landslide victory.

701
00:32:48,321 --> 00:32:51,020
Republicans again,
big realignment of votes and interest in

702
00:32:51,021 --> 00:32:51,854
the states.
Then so this kind of thing has happened 

703
00:32:53,091 --> 00:32:53,450
before.

704
00:32:53,450 --> 00:32:54,283
It's not unprecedented,
but what do you add about the global 

705
00:32:56,811 --> 00:32:58,660
element where now it's like we're so 
connected.

706
00:32:58,670 --> 00:32:59,503
We're all on twitter.
We're all watching TV and on the 

707
00:33:00,801 --> 00:33:01,634
Internet and that these things are 
happening at once and that were 100 

708
00:33:04,371 --> 00:33:06,830
years ago.
If something happened across the pond,

709
00:33:06,860 --> 00:33:07,693
it mattered,
but we didn't know about it for awhile 

710
00:33:09,110 --> 00:33:11,090
versus now.
It's all happening in real time.

711
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:11,953
This is true.
I mean there were more connections in 

712
00:33:13,321 --> 00:33:16,370
you might imagine in the 19th century,
but as you rightly say,

713
00:33:16,371 --> 00:33:17,204
the much slower,
so now there is much more global 

714
00:33:18,891 --> 00:33:19,700
phenomenon.
In fact,

715
00:33:19,700 --> 00:33:22,490
what is interesting is that very few 
countries where this kind of realignment

716
00:33:22,550 --> 00:33:24,630
isn't happening.
Canada is one not happen.

717
00:33:24,660 --> 00:33:25,493
That sofa a Spain is another Japan,
but generally speaking you can see the 

718
00:33:29,541 --> 00:33:30,374
same thing happening everywhere and I 
think what happens is that what now 

719
00:33:32,421 --> 00:33:33,254
because we're so interconnected,
what happens in one part of the world 

720
00:33:35,421 --> 00:33:38,070
tends to feed into what's happening 
elsewhere.

721
00:33:38,270 --> 00:33:39,103
Hence the great interest that Donald 
trump and his supporters have shown in 

722
00:33:41,900 --> 00:33:45,860
Brexit and Nigel farage coming over here
and making all these talks.

723
00:33:46,040 --> 00:33:49,090
That would not have happened 100 years 
ago because I don't think that would've.

724
00:33:49,430 --> 00:33:50,263
I don't think that would have happened 
10 years ago when I saw Nigel farrage 

725
00:33:52,611 --> 00:33:55,820
out there at this rally.
I thought this is really unprecedented.

726
00:33:55,821 --> 00:33:59,930
When is the last time that a,
that a leader from another country,

727
00:34:00,700 --> 00:34:01,600
even in a,
you know,

728
00:34:01,610 --> 00:34:02,390
an ally,
whatever it is,

729
00:34:02,390 --> 00:34:03,223
it doesn't matter.
Came and with supporting the opposition 

730
00:34:05,991 --> 00:34:07,460
and presidential candidate.
I thought this is.

731
00:34:08,180 --> 00:34:09,013
They probably is true.
It's a function of note cheaper and 

732
00:34:11,031 --> 00:34:13,070
travel and things like twitter and the 
Internet.

733
00:34:13,310 --> 00:34:14,390
Yeah.
Um.

734
00:34:14,420 --> 00:34:15,253
Alright.
So let's shift a little bit from the 

735
00:34:16,580 --> 00:34:20,360
politics of the data is sort of the 
broader stuff you describe yourself as a

736
00:34:20,361 --> 00:34:20,780
classical.

737
00:34:20,780 --> 00:34:21,110
Yes.
Yeah,

738
00:34:21,110 --> 00:34:21,943
correct.
So now what is the difference so that I 

739
00:34:23,481 --> 00:34:25,730
can explain it to my people properly 
when they say,

740
00:34:25,731 --> 00:34:27,290
Dave,
you've become a libertarian.

741
00:34:27,740 --> 00:34:30,350
How would you describe the difference 
between a classical liberal,

742
00:34:30,470 --> 00:34:31,303
liberal and a libertarian?
I don't think there is really such a 

743
00:34:33,070 --> 00:34:35,210
difference.
The word Libertarian,

744
00:34:35,240 --> 00:34:36,073
strictly speaking means an analyst.
It was originally used to describe 

745
00:34:39,500 --> 00:34:40,850
communist standard kits.
So the,

746
00:34:40,940 --> 00:34:44,210
he took her Pumpkin Bronte.
The problem here in the United States is

747
00:34:44,240 --> 00:34:45,073
the good word liberal has been hijacked 
by Social Democrats and so unlike the 

748
00:34:50,391 --> 00:34:54,440
European continent where liberal still 
means a believer in private property,

749
00:34:54,470 --> 00:34:57,320
limited government,
little government intervention,

750
00:34:57,321 --> 00:34:59,180
individual liberty,
pluralism,

751
00:34:59,460 --> 00:35:00,293
a,
it's now in the United States come to 

752
00:35:01,251 --> 00:35:02,084
mean something slightly different.
So the word libertarian came to be used 

753
00:35:05,181 --> 00:35:06,014
here in the United States to mean 
basically what everyone else would be 

754
00:35:08,751 --> 00:35:11,400
called a classical liberal or a liberal 
full stop.

755
00:35:11,600 --> 00:35:13,370
So I don't think there is that much 
difference.

756
00:35:13,550 --> 00:35:14,383
There is perhaps a slight difference 
emerging now in as much as increasingly 

757
00:35:17,601 --> 00:35:20,090
the word libertarian does mean something
more radical,

758
00:35:20,091 --> 00:35:24,200
a bit more extreme.
So if you say you're a libertarian,

759
00:35:24,230 --> 00:35:27,590
you probably imply that you're either an
anarchist already close to it.

760
00:35:27,830 --> 00:35:31,360
If you say you're a classical liberal,
you imply that well you'll,

761
00:35:31,380 --> 00:35:32,400
you know,
you'll not advocates.

762
00:35:32,500 --> 00:35:34,130
You do think there was a necessity for 
government.

763
00:35:34,131 --> 00:35:36,350
So you're slightly more moderate.
So I think that's what it's like.

764
00:35:36,770 --> 00:35:37,603
So I.
So I like that distinction because 

765
00:35:39,031 --> 00:35:39,864
that's definitely where I fall.
I think there is some use of the state 

766
00:35:42,120 --> 00:35:46,170
and then as I said,
I watched the Libertarian party,

767
00:35:46,171 --> 00:35:48,030
you know,
their convention and it was like they're

768
00:35:48,031 --> 00:35:49,810
screaming about,
you know,

769
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:52,590
a driver's licenses and it's like,
guys,

770
00:35:52,591 --> 00:35:54,420
you're really missing the ball here,
you know,

771
00:35:54,421 --> 00:35:58,010
like if we can't just let that go 
because there were not going to.

772
00:35:58,020 --> 00:35:58,853
Even if you're 100 percent right,
there's no way to really deep construct 

773
00:36:03,031 --> 00:36:04,680
an entire system like this.
Is there.

774
00:36:04,681 --> 00:36:07,500
Like even if even if the libertarians 
were purely purely right,

775
00:36:07,530 --> 00:36:11,580
is there a way to actually take a 
functioning somewhat functioning society

776
00:36:11,581 --> 00:36:15,070
and really well the whole thing through 
the political process.

777
00:36:15,390 --> 00:36:18,360
No burning down,
but yes.

778
00:36:18,361 --> 00:36:19,051
But no.
Well No,

779
00:36:19,051 --> 00:36:21,000
the wage,
if you won't do on change science in the

780
00:36:21,001 --> 00:36:21,834
longer run,
the thing to do is to do with the 

781
00:36:22,700 --> 00:36:26,070
grassroots level to create alternatives 
to governments,

782
00:36:26,110 --> 00:36:27,510
which I think is.
Well you shouldn't be doing.

783
00:36:27,700 --> 00:36:28,533
Uh,
but I think with the kind of policy 

784
00:36:29,610 --> 00:36:32,510
you're describing is rampantly 
self-indulgent.

785
00:36:32,610 --> 00:36:33,443
I would say this is the kind of politics
of a certain kind of person who is 

786
00:36:37,380 --> 00:36:40,320
interested in being more pure than 
everybody else.

787
00:36:40,380 --> 00:36:41,213
Yeah.
Having an identity that is not 

788
00:36:43,261 --> 00:36:44,094
compromising completely pure.
It's the same kind of mentality that 

789
00:36:46,351 --> 00:36:47,184
leads people to become religious 
fundamentalists of one variety or 

790
00:36:49,411 --> 00:36:50,010
another.

791
00:36:50,010 --> 00:36:50,843
Uh,
it's a desire to be the person in the 

792
00:36:52,261 --> 00:36:54,180
group who is right when everybody else 
is wrong,

793
00:36:54,570 --> 00:36:56,600
and so the more of the people moved to 
yours,

794
00:36:56,640 --> 00:36:57,473
your position,
the more you're going to insist upon 

795
00:36:58,771 --> 00:37:02,100
these really extreme peculiar things 
that still make you distinct.

796
00:37:02,340 --> 00:37:03,840
So I'm afraid I'm not at all 
sympathetic.

797
00:37:04,590 --> 00:37:05,423
Right?
I mean it just seems like a nonstarter 

798
00:37:06,600 --> 00:37:08,610
when they're screaming about legalizing 
heroin,

799
00:37:08,910 --> 00:37:10,560
which we could talk about the war on 
drugs,

800
00:37:10,561 --> 00:37:12,180
which you talked about a lot and I'd be 
happy to do that,

801
00:37:12,181 --> 00:37:15,690
but when they're going there to start 
and drivers licenses to start,

802
00:37:15,691 --> 00:37:16,524
it's like,
guys,

803
00:37:16,870 --> 00:37:17,703
this is not where it is.
Go for issues where you can persuade a 

804
00:37:20,191 --> 00:37:22,620
significant part of the public to come 
to your position.

805
00:37:22,650 --> 00:37:24,460
That's what politics is about.
Politics.

806
00:37:24,540 --> 00:37:28,460
It's all about striking a pose and 
trying to show how morally pure you all.

807
00:37:28,470 --> 00:37:31,410
That's just pure virtue signaling.
I say self indulgent nonsense.

808
00:37:31,650 --> 00:37:33,990
What do you want to do is make clear 
what your ultimate position is,

809
00:37:33,991 --> 00:37:34,681
but then say,
well,

810
00:37:34,681 --> 00:37:35,514
okay,
on you go for issues where you can 

811
00:37:37,381 --> 00:37:38,214
persuade the significant part of the 
broad public that you are right on that 

812
00:37:41,550 --> 00:37:42,383
yours is the way to go for and that's 
where you go from mainstream issue is 

813
00:37:44,130 --> 00:37:46,320
not a fringe.
Issues like that,

814
00:37:46,350 --> 00:37:48,630
which may be interesting for small 
number of people,

815
00:37:48,631 --> 00:37:53,631
but then there's a fun discussion to be 
had I suppose about that stuff,

816
00:37:54,031 --> 00:37:56,150
but not really a broader comes limiting.
Um,

817
00:37:56,210 --> 00:37:57,043
all right,
so how do you decide how much state 

818
00:37:58,561 --> 00:38:01,230
power is?
Okay?

819
00:38:01,500 --> 00:38:02,333
How do you make that distinction between
pure anarchy and I want something to 

820
00:38:06,211 --> 00:38:09,660
keep the wheels on here.
I think state powers,

821
00:38:10,440 --> 00:38:12,270
that's part of what it is,
but it's not really just that.

822
00:38:12,300 --> 00:38:13,133
The real distinction is between what 
parts of your life do you want to be 

823
00:38:16,321 --> 00:38:17,154
driven by individual choice or choices 
made my voluntary collectives versus 

824
00:38:22,081 --> 00:38:22,914
what parts of your life do you want to 
be determined through some kind of 

825
00:38:24,721 --> 00:38:27,360
collective decision making process 
through politics.

826
00:38:27,520 --> 00:38:28,353
It'd be like your governance and I think
the answer that if you're a classical 

827
00:38:30,991 --> 00:38:31,824
liberal you would give is that you want 
to maximize the scope of individual 

828
00:38:34,081 --> 00:38:34,914
decision making because that means 
greater scope for individual discovery 

829
00:38:38,920 --> 00:38:42,490
and the also means that most people are,
you would argue the best judges of their

830
00:38:42,491 --> 00:38:43,324
own interests,
so if you allow people to follow their 

831
00:38:45,131 --> 00:38:47,470
own judgment is what their interests are
collectively,

832
00:38:47,471 --> 00:38:48,304
you'll end up with the best outcome that
maximizes human welfare so that that 

833
00:38:51,011 --> 00:38:54,910
leaves though certain number of areas 
where there may be structural problems.

834
00:38:54,911 --> 00:38:56,980
It's very difficult to act collectively 
in these areas.

835
00:38:57,550 --> 00:38:59,140
If you want to use a technical economic 
terms,

836
00:38:59,141 --> 00:39:01,690
maybe there's a public good aspect to 
what you're talking about.

837
00:39:02,050 --> 00:39:02,883
National Defense and in these areas,
it probably does pay to do things 

838
00:39:06,581 --> 00:39:08,170
through a collective decision making 
process.

839
00:39:08,171 --> 00:39:09,004
There's something about these core areas
that means that they are so important 

840
00:39:12,790 --> 00:39:13,623
that they have to be on universally.
You can't have a situation where say 90 

841
00:39:16,991 --> 00:39:17,824
percent are covered by the law 
enforcement system and 10 percent or 

842
00:39:19,601 --> 00:39:20,740
not,
uh,

843
00:39:20,741 --> 00:39:21,574
that would have all kinds of major 
negative effects for the 90 percent who 

844
00:39:24,011 --> 00:39:26,160
were covered,
nevermind the 10 percent who,

845
00:39:26,190 --> 00:39:27,023
who weren't.
And so there's a kind of limited range 

846
00:39:28,511 --> 00:39:29,171
of areas where,
yes,

847
00:39:29,171 --> 00:39:30,004
you do definitely need the government.
Now I know there are people who will 

848
00:39:31,901 --> 00:39:32,401
say,
oh no,

849
00:39:32,401 --> 00:39:32,711
no,
you know,

850
00:39:32,711 --> 00:39:33,580
you could,
in theory,

851
00:39:33,581 --> 00:39:36,580
yes you can do with that government,
but my own view is that,

852
00:39:36,581 --> 00:39:37,630
well,
if that's the case,

853
00:39:37,631 --> 00:39:38,464
why isn't everyone going to Somalia?
I know people say Somalia is better off 

854
00:39:42,551 --> 00:39:43,384
than some of its neighbors.
And it's true that if the choice is 

855
00:39:45,580 --> 00:39:48,580
anarchy or Pol Pot,
you will go for anarchy.

856
00:39:48,970 --> 00:39:52,720
But that doesn't mean that necessarily a
stateless state of affairs is your first

857
00:39:52,721 --> 00:39:53,120
choice.

858
00:39:53,120 --> 00:39:54,980
Right?
So for all the people that would say,

859
00:39:54,981 --> 00:39:55,910
well,
you know,

860
00:39:55,911 --> 00:39:58,210
for the,
for the pure libertarian or whatever you

861
00:39:58,211 --> 00:39:59,960
want to call them at this point,
that would say no,

862
00:39:59,961 --> 00:40:02,660
remove the social safety net altogether.
Don't,

863
00:40:02,690 --> 00:40:03,523
don't help the poorest under any 
circumstances because if the government 

864
00:40:06,261 --> 00:40:09,200
gets out,
then private entities and private people

865
00:40:09,290 --> 00:40:11,870
will fully fill that void.
I suspect that's not.

866
00:40:11,930 --> 00:40:12,900
You don't believe that that.

867
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:13,831
Well,
no,

868
00:40:13,831 --> 00:40:14,664
the thing is I would ideally like to see
a situation where you don't have the 

869
00:40:17,521 --> 00:40:18,354
government providing that function,
but the trouble is how'd you get from 

870
00:40:20,251 --> 00:40:21,160
here to there?
Yeah.

871
00:40:21,330 --> 00:40:22,163
And the difficulty is that if you do 
simply withdraw government safety net 

872
00:40:24,811 --> 00:40:25,644
provision,
this fundamental social welfare 

873
00:40:26,821 --> 00:40:27,654
transfers,
it's going to take a long time probably 

874
00:40:30,330 --> 00:40:33,540
before you get something that takes its 
place.

875
00:40:34,320 --> 00:40:35,153
And in the meantime,
a lot of people are going to suffer 

876
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:37,433
quite severely.
And I don't think that's acceptable 

877
00:40:38,611 --> 00:40:41,370
quite honestly.
So the argument should be that,

878
00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:42,513
uh,
you should a through private action 

879
00:40:44,551 --> 00:40:49,110
develop nonstate forms of welfare.
We should revive mutualism,

880
00:40:49,170 --> 00:40:51,000
friendly societies,
fraternal orders,

881
00:40:51,001 --> 00:40:53,100
all the great institutions that we used 
to have,

882
00:40:53,430 --> 00:40:56,130
which delivered a huge range of welfare 
functions very,

883
00:40:56,131 --> 00:40:58,620
very effectively,
particularly here in the United States,

884
00:40:58,730 --> 00:41:01,440
so we should be looking to do that 
privately revived flat,

885
00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:03,980
but at the same time,
but we got rid of those as the state.

886
00:41:04,050 --> 00:41:06,060
Well,
what happens as the state groups,

887
00:41:06,080 --> 00:41:10,410
the plus also though it was due to quite
concrete legislative measures,

888
00:41:10,411 --> 00:41:14,460
particularly ones urged by the medical 
profession which were designed to drive,

889
00:41:14,700 --> 00:41:15,533
um,
friendly societies out of healthcare 

890
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:19,710
provision to what was called lodge 
practice.

891
00:41:19,950 --> 00:41:23,940
That that was a purely legislative 
function also crowding out by the state.

892
00:41:24,090 --> 00:41:24,923
It was just a lobby group.
The doctors got legislatures to pass 

893
00:41:29,101 --> 00:41:29,934
laws which made it very,
very difficult for a private volunteer 

894
00:41:32,761 --> 00:41:34,460
operation.
But the other thing you need to do,

895
00:41:34,760 --> 00:41:37,000
I'm done by two original point,
is to say that,

896
00:41:37,010 --> 00:41:37,821
well,
yes,

897
00:41:37,821 --> 00:41:41,090
there is probably going to be a kind of 
bottom level,

898
00:41:41,180 --> 00:41:42,013
a provision provided by government 
through the political process to ensure 

899
00:41:44,991 --> 00:41:47,480
that nobody falls below a certain 
minimum level.

900
00:41:47,481 --> 00:41:50,720
That nobody's starving the street.
People do have a minimal amount of,

901
00:41:50,940 --> 00:41:52,010
uh,
resources,

902
00:41:52,050 --> 00:41:53,570
uh,
so that they can actually survive.

903
00:41:53,840 --> 00:41:54,673
Now,
what you can then do is get into 

904
00:41:55,910 --> 00:41:56,743
hydrostatic log about what the best way 
of doing this is and certainly the way 

905
00:41:58,971 --> 00:41:59,804
we're doing it now in many western 
countries is not the best way of doing 

906
00:42:02,961 --> 00:42:04,210
it,
but that's a minor argument.

907
00:42:04,370 --> 00:42:06,590
The major principle I think is you do 
concede if,

908
00:42:06,620 --> 00:42:07,453
if,
if you're in my position that there 

909
00:42:08,601 --> 00:42:11,090
should be some kind of residual state 
function of that salt.

910
00:42:11,430 --> 00:42:13,400
Singapore probably has the best way of 
doing it,

911
00:42:13,401 --> 00:42:14,234
I would say amongst which is why well,
they have a system of forced savings 

912
00:42:17,301 --> 00:42:22,301
where essentially you are obliged to pay
money into a series of accounts,

913
00:42:23,090 --> 00:42:26,450
one of which covers your healthcare 
costs mainly in old age,

914
00:42:26,451 --> 00:42:30,530
one of which gives you a pension.
Another one gives you protection against

915
00:42:30,650 --> 00:42:31,483
sickness or unemployment.
Now the crucial difference between that 

916
00:42:33,861 --> 00:42:36,380
and the system we have is that the 
accounts have your name on it,

917
00:42:36,500 --> 00:42:41,260
so it's your money and you make these 
for savings into these accounts,

918
00:42:41,270 --> 00:42:41,420
right?

919
00:42:41,420 --> 00:42:44,480
Your working life,
you've drawn them when you need them and

920
00:42:44,481 --> 00:42:45,800
if you die,
that's a,

921
00:42:45,830 --> 00:42:47,720
you know,
you fall under the proverbial bus,

922
00:42:48,080 --> 00:42:48,913
all the money you paid in it becomes 
part of your estate and goes to your 

923
00:42:52,251 --> 00:42:53,720
heirs.
That's incredible.

924
00:42:53,721 --> 00:42:56,180
Now that's a much better system than the
one we have here.

925
00:42:56,210 --> 00:42:57,043
That's incredible.
So it doesn't just get pulled into 

926
00:42:58,371 --> 00:43:01,700
something else and it's your property.
If you die,

927
00:43:02,030 --> 00:43:04,940
let's say you have a large mountain,
you'll be happy with this.

928
00:43:04,960 --> 00:43:06,560
I'm not sure what that is.
Very effective.

929
00:43:06,561 --> 00:43:07,394
You've got a large amount in your health
savings account to cover the really 

930
00:43:09,621 --> 00:43:12,650
expensive part of healthcare which is 
looking after you in the last six months

931
00:43:12,651 --> 00:43:14,380
of your life.
But let's say you,

932
00:43:14,390 --> 00:43:17,570
you die suddenly from a heart attack.
You don't like that,

933
00:43:18,020 --> 00:43:21,170
that you weren't drawn in that fund and 
it's there for your heirs.

934
00:43:21,170 --> 00:43:22,410
It's part of your estate.
I mean,

935
00:43:22,440 --> 00:43:23,830
I'm completely for that.
I,

936
00:43:23,831 --> 00:43:25,460
I suspect that the left,
you know,

937
00:43:25,461 --> 00:43:26,330
they would say,
well no,

938
00:43:26,331 --> 00:43:28,750
the state should be able to take that.
Now you're gone and,

939
00:43:28,751 --> 00:43:30,350
and give it to somebody else.
Well,

940
00:43:30,351 --> 00:43:32,390
maybe,
but I mean the point is I think that's.

941
00:43:32,480 --> 00:43:34,340
I would argue against that for a whole 
number of reasons,

942
00:43:34,700 --> 00:43:37,100
but I think that that's a much better 
system and saying that's the system they

943
00:43:37,101 --> 00:43:37,934
have in Singapore,
which is what do they do for the people 

944
00:43:39,051 --> 00:43:41,200
that are outside of the system that 
really,

945
00:43:41,260 --> 00:43:44,030
really poor the government actually 
makes contributions on your behalf.

946
00:43:44,240 --> 00:43:48,260
But Singapore is such a successful 
economy and society that very,

947
00:43:48,261 --> 00:43:49,094
very few people are on such low incomes 
that they can't make some contribution 

948
00:43:52,670 --> 00:43:53,503
and the ones who have very low incomes 
to say either the state's contribution 

949
00:43:55,611 --> 00:43:58,070
is entirely the minimal level or at tops
them up.

950
00:43:58,460 --> 00:44:01,190
But that's actually a very marginal,
very small number of people.

951
00:44:01,191 --> 00:44:04,580
And so if we wanted to change to a 
system that was a little more like that,

952
00:44:04,581 --> 00:44:05,414
and we've already hit on this a couple 
times about how incremental change is 

953
00:44:07,521 --> 00:44:08,354
tough,
but you don't want to burn it down at 

954
00:44:08,961 --> 00:44:10,190
the same time.
How,

955
00:44:10,250 --> 00:44:11,083
how beyond just making the case for it,
and I hadn't even heard of that 

956
00:44:13,821 --> 00:44:15,650
Singapore thing.
So now some new people are going to hear

957
00:44:15,651 --> 00:44:16,484
about that concept.
How do you actually start making that 

958
00:44:20,391 --> 00:44:20,841
happen?
I mean,

959
00:44:20,841 --> 00:44:22,610
is that you have to start doing it at 
the local level.

960
00:44:22,611 --> 00:44:23,330
I mean,
just get,

961
00:44:23,330 --> 00:44:24,163
he knows probably that probably would 
require a change at the national level 

962
00:44:26,751 --> 00:44:27,584
because you're talking about something 
which would replace the way social 

963
00:44:28,881 --> 00:44:29,714
security is currently run.
They will switch social from a pay as 

964
00:44:32,071 --> 00:44:34,500
you go system to a fully funded system 
of this,

965
00:44:34,501 --> 00:44:35,334
this kind that would require action by 
Congress or at the very least maybe by 

966
00:44:38,311 --> 00:44:40,200
state legislatures for some of the other
forms.

967
00:44:40,520 --> 00:44:41,353
Um,
I think we just need to make the 

968
00:44:42,481 --> 00:44:43,314
political case written.
The difficulty of course is that you 

969
00:44:45,001 --> 00:44:45,834
have a whole bunch of people in the 
existing system who can't simply be 

970
00:44:49,051 --> 00:44:49,884
switched over to the new one.
So you're going to have a period of 

971
00:44:51,841 --> 00:44:52,674
about 30 years,
certainly 20 years where there's an 

972
00:44:55,321 --> 00:44:58,410
overlap where you have the new system in
place and you have people who are,

973
00:44:58,870 --> 00:45:00,570
uh,
under the old system.

974
00:45:00,600 --> 00:45:02,070
That's inevitable.
It seems to me.

975
00:45:02,490 --> 00:45:04,410
And that means in the short run,
this could be quite possibly,

976
00:45:04,411 --> 00:45:05,970
but I think in the long run,
well worth doing.

977
00:45:06,180 --> 00:45:07,020
Yeah.
Interesting.

978
00:45:07,021 --> 00:45:09,270
So I heard you in a video that I saw you
do yesterday.

979
00:45:09,600 --> 00:45:10,433
Talk about how,
how Libertarians are generally thought 

980
00:45:12,421 --> 00:45:14,120
of as not interventionists.
Yeah.

981
00:45:14,610 --> 00:45:16,830
You think there,
although I don't think you prescribed to

982
00:45:16,831 --> 00:45:17,664
it,
you think there is a situation where a 

983
00:45:18,721 --> 00:45:22,830
libertarian could be for some 
intervention.

984
00:45:22,860 --> 00:45:27,390
Basically the,
the for any kind of libertarian,

985
00:45:27,391 --> 00:45:29,670
classical liberal,
the question with foreign policy is,

986
00:45:29,671 --> 00:45:30,504
which course of action is going to most 
maximize liberty both in the country 

987
00:45:35,221 --> 00:45:36,054
that is potentially doing the 
intervening in this case the US for 

988
00:45:38,131 --> 00:45:38,964
example,
and the part of the world where the 

989
00:45:40,231 --> 00:45:42,240
intervention might take place.
Now.

990
00:45:42,660 --> 00:45:46,440
That should be the guiding principle 
behind what your foreign policy is.

991
00:45:46,530 --> 00:45:47,850
Now,
what I would say,

992
00:45:48,060 --> 00:45:50,460
and I agree with friend of mine,
Randy Barnett on this,

993
00:45:50,520 --> 00:45:51,353
is he's been on the show.
There's nothing inherent or necessary 

994
00:45:54,780 --> 00:45:58,740
about libertarian principles that means 
you must be a non interventionist.

995
00:45:59,340 --> 00:46:02,790
What I would argue on they're here,
perhaps I disagree slightly with Randy,

996
00:46:02,820 --> 00:46:04,070
is that,
uh,

997
00:46:04,590 --> 00:46:05,423
the number of cases where the benefits 
of liberty will be so great that you 

998
00:46:08,401 --> 00:46:09,870
would support intervention is actually 
very,

999
00:46:09,871 --> 00:46:10,704
very slight.
I would apply something like a just war 

1000
00:46:13,771 --> 00:46:14,160
principle.

1001
00:46:14,160 --> 00:46:17,610
You have to show that really the benefit
is bound to exceed the cost,

1002
00:46:17,880 --> 00:46:19,180
uh,
and that the,

1003
00:46:19,420 --> 00:46:22,260
this is knowable and that the 
intervention could be done in a way that

1004
00:46:22,261 --> 00:46:24,780
doesn't systematically violate human 
rights.

1005
00:46:24,781 --> 00:46:26,490
So that's quite a high bar.
Yeah.

1006
00:46:26,580 --> 00:46:27,460
Wait,
let's pause there for a sec.

1007
00:46:27,461 --> 00:46:31,140
How much does the benefit have to be for
you and your society,

1008
00:46:31,141 --> 00:46:33,390
not just the people that you're 
potentially doing?

1009
00:46:33,391 --> 00:46:34,224
Well,
I think it's more a matter of the cost 

1010
00:46:35,581 --> 00:46:38,670
because if you think about intervention 
in foreign parts of the world,

1011
00:46:38,720 --> 00:46:39,553
the,
one of the main arguments against that 

1012
00:46:40,471 --> 00:46:41,304
from a libertarian or classical liberal 
position is that it actually is bad for 

1013
00:46:44,461 --> 00:46:45,294
liberty back home in the country doing 
the intervening to the extent that the 

1014
00:46:48,930 --> 00:46:52,620
United States becomes an empire and it 
is an empire that's not pussy foot about

1015
00:46:52,621 --> 00:46:55,890
this.
That undermines republican institutions.

1016
00:46:55,950 --> 00:46:59,280
And Liberty back home,
and this is not a new phenomenon.

1017
00:47:00,180 --> 00:47:01,013
Many of the things that led to the 
growth of the state in Great Britain 

1018
00:47:03,150 --> 00:47:06,750
were because of British intervention 
outside the rest of the world.

1019
00:47:07,620 --> 00:47:09,630
The India office,
which ran the Indian empire,

1020
00:47:09,780 --> 00:47:10,613
was our first big modern department of 
States and then transformed the rest of 

1021
00:47:13,711 --> 00:47:15,670
government by its example.
Same things.

1022
00:47:16,680 --> 00:47:19,500
You do these things over there,
wherever there is,

1023
00:47:19,501 --> 00:47:20,334
and then you actually need more state 
power at well under that is provides an 

1024
00:47:22,921 --> 00:47:25,650
example.
So in order to have,

1025
00:47:25,680 --> 00:47:26,513
for example,
you need to read large military if 

1026
00:47:27,421 --> 00:47:28,254
you're going to have a kind of global 
interventionist role that inevitably 

1027
00:47:31,031 --> 00:47:33,730
does things like increase the role of 
military domestically,

1028
00:47:33,790 --> 00:47:36,760
increases its purchasing power,
its clout,

1029
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:41,200
builds up the military industrial 
complex that Eisenhower warned against,

1030
00:47:41,440 --> 00:47:42,273
has all kinds of bad effects.
It also leads to growth of a 

1031
00:47:43,751 --> 00:47:44,584
surveillance state.
It leads to the growth of the police 

1032
00:47:46,931 --> 00:47:49,000
power of the state,
which we spoke about earlier,

1033
00:47:49,720 --> 00:47:51,340
which you might say is necessary in 
certain cases,

1034
00:47:51,341 --> 00:47:53,180
but certainly not to the degree,
but he now.

1035
00:47:53,460 --> 00:47:58,090
And it just also generally gives our 
rulers ideas above their station because

1036
00:47:58,091 --> 00:47:59,710
if you have the mindset that,
oh,

1037
00:47:59,711 --> 00:48:00,544
we can go over and be this benevolent 
despot and transform the lives of these 

1038
00:48:03,581 --> 00:48:04,414
people in other parts of the world,
this tends to naturally create a 

1039
00:48:06,701 --> 00:48:07,331
mindset.
We think,

1040
00:48:07,331 --> 00:48:08,164
well,
there's these people here in our own 

1041
00:48:08,771 --> 00:48:12,400
society they could do with our 
benevolent interference as well.

1042
00:48:12,401 --> 00:48:13,630
And that's a very dangerous mindset.

1043
00:48:13,710 --> 00:48:14,543
Right.
And somehow we always have money to do 

1044
00:48:15,931 --> 00:48:16,764
those adventures,
but we never had money to help what's 

1045
00:48:18,961 --> 00:48:19,471
happening.
Yeah,

1046
00:48:19,471 --> 00:48:20,360
what a surprise.
Yeah.

1047
00:48:20,370 --> 00:48:21,450
What could be happening there,

1048
00:48:21,800 --> 00:48:22,633
you know,
it benefits all kinds of people that 

1049
00:48:23,541 --> 00:48:24,374
mean.
The other quite shameful thing is that 

1050
00:48:25,251 --> 00:48:26,084
this typically involves sending young 
men from often poor backgrounds into 

1051
00:48:28,911 --> 00:48:29,744
harms way when the children of the 
people making these decisions are 

1052
00:48:33,471 --> 00:48:36,350
certainly not joining the military.
And if they are,

1053
00:48:36,351 --> 00:48:38,270
they're probably not going to be sent 
into harms way in that way,

1054
00:48:38,271 --> 00:48:39,104
which I think is seriously disreputable.
So I think I wouldn't rule out that 

1055
00:48:42,021 --> 00:48:46,340
there are certain cases where an 
intervention could be on balance,

1056
00:48:46,341 --> 00:48:47,174
beneficial for liberty both at home and 
in the place where the intervention 

1057
00:48:50,361 --> 00:48:51,194
takes place,
but I think that's vanishingly very low 

1058
00:48:53,721 --> 00:48:55,790
probability.
There are very few cases like that in my

1059
00:48:55,791 --> 00:48:56,150
view.

1060
00:48:56,150 --> 00:48:57,170
Right.
So let's,

1061
00:48:57,171 --> 00:48:58,910
uh,
let's just take Syria for example,

1062
00:48:58,911 --> 00:49:02,360
because that's obviously the big one 
that we know over 400,000

1063
00:49:02,361 --> 00:49:06,620
people are dead.
This thing is not ending anytime soon.

1064
00:49:06,770 --> 00:49:10,580
It's hard to know whose side we're on,
what's going on with Iran and Russia,

1065
00:49:10,790 --> 00:49:12,890
all of that stuff.
Now.

1066
00:49:13,190 --> 00:49:14,023
I think the main,
the mainstream libertarian think would 

1067
00:49:17,061 --> 00:49:22,061
be even if we partly created this mess,
we just got to cut our losses and let it

1068
00:49:22,311 --> 00:49:23,630
be.
How do you,

1069
00:49:23,720 --> 00:49:24,553
how does ethics and morality get 
involved as a classical liberal where 

1070
00:49:27,051 --> 00:49:28,490
you see,
okay,

1071
00:49:28,491 --> 00:49:29,324
we don't want to be killing more people,
but maybe we could create humanitarian 

1072
00:49:32,121 --> 00:49:36,830
corridors or maybe there's a way to do 
some good there,

1073
00:49:36,860 --> 00:49:39,290
but it may not be cost effective for us.

1074
00:49:39,630 --> 00:49:42,510
The question is who are the actors in 
this thing?

1075
00:49:42,540 --> 00:49:43,770
Because people always say,
okay,

1076
00:49:43,980 --> 00:49:46,140
we got to do something,
or what should we do?

1077
00:49:46,410 --> 00:49:51,410
Who is the we in this sentence now I 
think people get two things confused and

1078
00:49:51,481 --> 00:49:54,150
conflated.
One is what should civil society do?

1079
00:49:54,180 --> 00:49:55,013
What should or can we do as individuals 
and they're all kinds of things we can 

1080
00:49:57,931 --> 00:50:00,390
do depending on what you think is the 
right course of action,

1081
00:50:00,750 --> 00:50:03,630
but the other thing of course it means 
is what should our government,

1082
00:50:03,660 --> 00:50:06,600
the government of United States,
the United Kingdom,

1083
00:50:06,601 --> 00:50:09,540
wherever do now in terms of what 
governments should do.

1084
00:50:09,570 --> 00:50:13,260
Governments in this context are 
basically the purveyors of deadly force,

1085
00:50:13,880 --> 00:50:14,713
which is that core function and so the 
question therefore I think is slightly 

1086
00:50:17,671 --> 00:50:20,730
different and really you want to 
minimize harm.

1087
00:50:20,820 --> 00:50:21,653
It seems to me now I would argue that 
actually the course of action that will 

1088
00:50:23,701 --> 00:50:27,560
minimize harm in most cases is classic 
foreign policy realism.

1089
00:50:29,030 --> 00:50:29,863
Because what you want to do is to 
minimize the chances of war in large 

1090
00:50:32,751 --> 00:50:33,584
scale conflict and I think actually 
channeling bismarck is probably the way 

1091
00:50:36,591 --> 00:50:38,360
to go.
Strange thing for liberals say,

1092
00:50:38,780 --> 00:50:42,410
but I do think in foreign policy,
asking yourself the question,

1093
00:50:42,440 --> 00:50:43,273
what would bismarck do is probably a 
good way to go because foreign policy 

1094
00:50:47,031 --> 00:50:51,440
rail is slight bismal do not generally 
calls large scale walls.

1095
00:50:51,650 --> 00:50:53,570
Uh,
and that's what you want to do.

1096
00:50:53,571 --> 00:50:55,370
We'd be looking at what the government 
should do.

1097
00:50:55,550 --> 00:50:58,490
You're looking to try and minimize the 
amount of armed conflict that happened.

1098
00:50:58,720 --> 00:50:59,710
Sure.
So what do you,

1099
00:50:59,740 --> 00:51:02,410
what would bismarck do in a situation 
that's already begun?

1100
00:51:02,470 --> 00:51:04,300
Oh,
it's too late for us now,

1101
00:51:05,220 --> 00:51:07,270
but is there,
is there a moral cost,

1102
00:51:07,271 --> 00:51:08,104
I guess is what my question is.
Is there a moral cost of knowing that 

1103
00:51:10,391 --> 00:51:11,470
something horrible has happened

1104
00:51:11,470 --> 00:51:15,050
happening and that perhaps you could do 
something again?

1105
00:51:15,051 --> 00:51:17,380
It's who's the,
you think it's this?

1106
00:51:17,400 --> 00:51:18,370
Yeah.
The question is,

1107
00:51:18,371 --> 00:51:20,980
is if you're saying there's something 
terrible going on there,

1108
00:51:21,370 --> 00:51:22,203
I feel a kind of moral responsibility as
a human being for the suffering of my 

1109
00:51:24,401 --> 00:51:25,780
fellow human beings in that part of the 
world.

1110
00:51:26,050 --> 00:51:26,883
All kinds of things you can do,
you can give money to a non government 

1111
00:51:29,171 --> 00:51:31,000
organization or a charity.
Some of that medicine.

1112
00:51:31,010 --> 00:51:31,843
So I'll prompt,
yeah,

1113
00:51:32,020 --> 00:51:36,090
you might even volunteer to work with 
MSF as adoptive you're a doctor,

1114
00:51:36,100 --> 00:51:36,933
a paramedic,
you might support things like the 

1115
00:51:38,621 --> 00:51:42,100
creation of a lobby.
The government in Syria,

1116
00:51:42,130 --> 00:51:46,330
the competent is to allow people to lead
noncoms civilian sullied the combat.

1117
00:51:46,331 --> 00:51:49,660
Don't cease fires you might argue for if
you.

1118
00:51:49,661 --> 00:51:51,430
On the other hand you might say,
well,

1119
00:51:51,431 --> 00:51:52,264
I think that this is the right side in 
this conflict and if you feel strongly 

1120
00:51:54,641 --> 00:51:56,740
about him,
pick up a gun and go and fight that.

1121
00:51:56,780 --> 00:51:57,613
That's the honest and vulnerable thing 
to do or give money to help people 

1122
00:52:01,960 --> 00:52:03,910
acquire mysteries and things of that.
Now the other hand,

1123
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:05,650
the government is what you're talking 
about.

1124
00:52:05,890 --> 00:52:08,850
My argument is that typically government
intervention,

1125
00:52:08,880 --> 00:52:09,713
military intervention by states in 
conflicts of this kind is almost always 

1126
00:52:13,481 --> 00:52:15,400
going to make the conflict more 
intractable war,

1127
00:52:15,401 --> 00:52:16,780
bloody,
more extensive,

1128
00:52:16,781 --> 00:52:17,614
more long lasting,
and it's not going to be ultimately use 

1129
00:52:19,391 --> 00:52:21,790
the interest even of the outside 
parameters.

1130
00:52:21,820 --> 00:52:25,840
So much of this is driven by the desire 
to avoid the other side getting on top.

1131
00:52:26,110 --> 00:52:28,480
And so you know the realist view there 
as well.

1132
00:52:28,870 --> 00:52:29,703
Usually steer clear of it,
unless a vital national interest is at 

1133
00:52:31,690 --> 00:52:32,523
stake.
You do not get involved because both on 

1134
00:52:36,280 --> 00:52:40,210
pragmatic machiavellian grounds,
but also on moral grounds because if you

1135
00:52:40,211 --> 00:52:41,044
intervene,
this is very likely to make the whole 

1136
00:52:41,831 --> 00:52:43,690
conflict worse than the otherwise would 
be.

1137
00:52:44,730 --> 00:52:45,311
Syria.
I mean,

1138
00:52:45,311 --> 00:52:48,490
let me show this work.
In the case of Syria only predicted when

1139
00:52:48,491 --> 00:52:50,320
the Arab spring was going on that it 
became serious.

1140
00:52:50,350 --> 00:52:52,060
It would be a bloodbath.
Now,

1141
00:52:52,061 --> 00:52:53,640
this didn't require great prescience 
online.

1142
00:52:54,070 --> 00:52:54,903
My part,
because the whole point about Syria is 

1143
00:52:56,651 --> 00:53:00,180
that the government is dominated by a 
cleanse,

1144
00:53:00,181 --> 00:53:01,450
stroke,
religious sect.

1145
00:53:01,451 --> 00:53:02,284
The News Irys,
the Alawites is what asset comes from 

1146
00:53:04,690 --> 00:53:05,523
who come from the mountain regional 
Latakia virtually all of the other 

1147
00:53:09,460 --> 00:53:12,260
people in Syria,
particularly the Sunni Orthodox,

1148
00:53:12,350 --> 00:53:14,920
Sunni Muslims,
regard them as rank heretics.

1149
00:53:15,220 --> 00:53:16,053
That means that a democratic regime in 
Syria is probably not feasible at the 

1150
00:53:19,541 --> 00:53:22,960
moment because if I sat on the alibis,
give up power.

1151
00:53:23,420 --> 00:53:24,253
You're dead.
Yeah,

1152
00:53:24,300 --> 00:53:25,133
and they're not so not going to do it.
So I knew there would be armed 

1153
00:53:27,211 --> 00:53:29,160
resistance to any movement to have for 
the state.

1154
00:53:29,161 --> 00:53:32,700
Now wants the civil ward started.
The question is what do you do?

1155
00:53:32,880 --> 00:53:35,370
The problem I think as far as western 
policy goes,

1156
00:53:35,371 --> 00:53:39,240
is that a large part of western policy 
has been to try and overthrow Asad,

1157
00:53:39,630 --> 00:53:44,310
but they have willed the end without 
willing the means they've intervened,

1158
00:53:44,460 --> 00:53:45,293
but the intervention has actually been 
of a kind that has simply made the 

1159
00:53:48,331 --> 00:53:49,164
conflict more intractable and gone on 
longer and it's provoked countervailing 

1160
00:53:52,590 --> 00:53:53,423
intervention by the Iranians and the 
Russians who for their own strategic 

1161
00:53:56,491 --> 00:53:58,110
reasons,
don't want to see ever overthrown,

1162
00:53:58,360 --> 00:53:59,193
so that shows how government 
intervention can actually make a 

1163
00:54:00,541 --> 00:54:03,570
conflict that probably would have ended 
one way or another.

1164
00:54:03,960 --> 00:54:06,810
I'm much more intractable.
My own view,

1165
00:54:06,811 --> 00:54:07,644
actually 40 it's worth is that the only 
really effective way of resolving that 

1166
00:54:11,131 --> 00:54:13,710
conflict is to partition Syria into 
three or four states.

1167
00:54:13,860 --> 00:54:15,240
I think that's the only way to actually 
do it.

1168
00:54:15,320 --> 00:54:16,490
Yeah.
I mean incredibly.

1169
00:54:16,520 --> 00:54:18,500
Joe Biden,
when he was running for president,

1170
00:54:18,501 --> 00:54:22,490
when he ended up being a Obama's bp at 
eight years ago,

1171
00:54:22,850 --> 00:54:24,830
there was a moment in the debates where 
he said,

1172
00:54:24,831 --> 00:54:25,664
we have to partition Syria and partition
Iraq and there should be an actual 

1173
00:54:29,811 --> 00:54:30,644
Kurdish nation and this is the sooner 
you should have an agent in the sheet 

1174
00:54:32,391 --> 00:54:33,224
and all that,
and people laughed at him because it 

1175
00:54:34,161 --> 00:54:34,994
sounded,
it sounded very academic and we're not 

1176
00:54:36,021 --> 00:54:38,150
going to split these countries,
but at this point,

1177
00:54:38,160 --> 00:54:40,170
Syria is not really a nation state by 
anybody.

1178
00:54:40,240 --> 00:54:42,530
That's a perfectly rational solution.
He was completed much about that.

1179
00:54:43,360 --> 00:54:47,390
Who looks at that part of the world and 
it's a political realist is going to say

1180
00:54:47,391 --> 00:54:48,224
that partitioning several of these 
states that were created totally 

1181
00:54:50,691 --> 00:54:51,210
artificial.
Yeah.

1182
00:54:51,210 --> 00:54:53,890
By the British and the French during 
World War II,

1183
00:54:53,940 --> 00:54:54,773
even on geographic lines,
really unreduced just lines in the sand 

1184
00:54:57,811 --> 00:54:59,010
as the famous book calls it,

1185
00:54:59,640 --> 00:55:01,260
you know,
those states not viable.

1186
00:55:01,261 --> 00:55:02,580
They should really be broken up and 
that's,

1187
00:55:02,610 --> 00:55:05,490
that would be a rational,
humane response to the situation

1188
00:55:05,540 --> 00:55:06,990
you now have.
Um,

1189
00:55:07,030 --> 00:55:07,863
I don't want to spend a ton of time with
this because we don't have that much 

1190
00:55:09,011 --> 00:55:09,790
more time,
but how much,

1191
00:55:09,790 --> 00:55:10,623
how much of what's going on in the 
Middle East is just because of the guys 

1192
00:55:13,061 --> 00:55:13,894
that were drawing the map.
And if you look at a country like 

1193
00:55:14,771 --> 00:55:16,690
Jordan,
it looks ridiculous.

1194
00:55:16,960 --> 00:55:17,793
The shape of Jordan is absurd.
It looks like a puzzle piece that got 

1195
00:55:20,201 --> 00:55:21,160
mangled.
I mean,

1196
00:55:21,161 --> 00:55:21,994
how much is just that the people 
actually drawing the map had nothing to 

1197
00:55:25,001 --> 00:55:27,610
do with what was happening on the 
ground.

1198
00:55:28,300 --> 00:55:29,133
By the way,
I don't blame you guys solely for that 

1199
00:55:30,011 --> 00:55:31,920
because the Ottoman empire ran a lot of 
it for a long time.

1200
00:55:32,140 --> 00:55:32,440
Actually.

1201
00:55:32,440 --> 00:55:33,310
What mean?
Seriously,

1202
00:55:33,330 --> 00:55:34,163
we,
you don't most terms what they will say 

1203
00:55:35,760 --> 00:55:38,350
a pretty quickly is that things were 
working a lot better.

1204
00:55:38,351 --> 00:55:40,750
They,
when they run it for you,

1205
00:55:41,230 --> 00:55:42,063
if,
if,

1206
00:55:42,150 --> 00:55:42,983
if France Britain had followed the 
ultimate anz and use the ultimate local 

1207
00:55:46,001 --> 00:55:49,720
government units,
things might well have worked out better

1208
00:55:49,810 --> 00:55:52,840
because those units actually reflected 
under underlying realities.

1209
00:55:52,841 --> 00:55:53,674
Many guises,
but know that that's part of the 

1210
00:55:55,121 --> 00:55:57,010
problem.
Part of the problem in there as in large

1211
00:55:57,011 --> 00:55:59,410
areas of Africa is that you have 
political units,

1212
00:55:59,411 --> 00:56:03,190
which do not make demographic sense,
but it's not just that I think there are

1213
00:56:03,191 --> 00:56:06,030
other factors as well.
There's been a collapse in the,

1214
00:56:06,090 --> 00:56:09,100
in the government,
in that huge area of the world,

1215
00:56:09,101 --> 00:56:11,080
central Africa,
up through the Middle East,

1216
00:56:11,590 --> 00:56:14,170
places like Libya for example.
What has happened is that the state,

1217
00:56:14,171 --> 00:56:15,004
the political order has collapsed and 
what we're seeing is lots of violence 

1218
00:56:18,521 --> 00:56:22,930
caused by nonstate actors,
basically clans,

1219
00:56:22,960 --> 00:56:24,370
gangs,
tribes,

1220
00:56:24,670 --> 00:56:25,360
terrorists groups.

1221
00:56:25,360 --> 00:56:26,193
We call them church people,
so we might as well call them criminal 

1222
00:56:27,311 --> 00:56:28,930
gangs.
That's what they are basically,

1223
00:56:29,350 --> 00:56:30,183
and until some kind of stable political 
order is recreated in that part of the 

1224
00:56:33,191 --> 00:56:34,024
world,
I don't see that state of chaos ending 

1225
00:56:36,011 --> 00:56:36,844
anytime soon.
The problem is that the existing 

1226
00:56:38,651 --> 00:56:39,484
political order,
and this is where those guys sykes and 

1227
00:56:41,460 --> 00:56:42,293
Pico come in,
is simply not sustainable because it's 

1228
00:56:45,251 --> 00:56:48,010
based on an irrational thing.
The other thing that's going on there is

1229
00:56:48,011 --> 00:56:48,844
that basically you've had very,
very rapid population growth in that 

1230
00:56:51,101 --> 00:56:52,720
part of the world in the last 30,
40 years.

1231
00:56:53,040 --> 00:56:53,873
Uh,
probably more than that region can 

1232
00:56:55,991 --> 00:56:59,620
sustain ecologically and you have an 
economy in large parts of that region,

1233
00:56:59,920 --> 00:57:03,400
which is a very badly run because it's 
corrupting of incompetent government and

1234
00:57:03,401 --> 00:57:04,234
be as very dependent upon oil and what 
you have now is lots and lots of 

1235
00:57:07,450 --> 00:57:12,450
unemployed but overeducated young men 
and that is always and everywhere.

1236
00:57:13,300 --> 00:57:14,710
A recipe for trouble.
Right?

1237
00:57:14,711 --> 00:57:16,050
It's fertile ground for terrorists.

1238
00:57:18,180 --> 00:57:19,013
Yeah.
Is there a little saving grace in that 

1239
00:57:20,380 --> 00:57:21,213
because of the Internet now and that 
information can spread so fast that 

1240
00:57:24,521 --> 00:57:25,354
these people are learning.
There's other ways of life and that may 

1241
00:57:27,401 --> 00:57:30,640
be that ultimately will be what allows 
them to,

1242
00:57:30,820 --> 00:57:31,653
as they get older,
to create societies that'll be a little 

1243
00:57:33,401 --> 00:57:34,300
more egalitarian.
Yes.

1244
00:57:34,380 --> 00:57:35,213
I think.
I think I am optimistic in the longer 

1245
00:57:36,551 --> 00:57:38,140
term and the short term.
I'm a pessimist.

1246
00:57:38,141 --> 00:57:41,090
I'm afraid in the long run medium term,
I'm an optimist for that possible design

1247
00:57:41,120 --> 00:57:41,953
for most of the world because I do think
that things like that mean that the 

1248
00:57:43,751 --> 00:57:45,820
world is going to become more 
interconnected.

1249
00:57:45,821 --> 00:57:48,990
People are going to be more aware of 
different ways of doing things too.

1250
00:57:49,020 --> 00:57:50,410
We're back to what we spoke about 
earlier.

1251
00:57:50,710 --> 00:57:51,543
Uh,
they'll realize that their identity is 

1252
00:57:52,451 --> 00:57:53,284
not something that they're stuck with,
that they can actually shape their own 

1253
00:57:54,941 --> 00:57:55,774
life more,
but I think it's going to be awhile 

1254
00:57:56,770 --> 00:57:57,780
before we get there,
my friend.

1255
00:57:58,080 --> 00:57:58,913
All right.
There's a whole slew of other things I 

1256
00:57:59,591 --> 00:58:01,840
want to talk to you about to finish.
So we,

1257
00:58:01,870 --> 00:58:02,703
but we only have time for one of them.
Should we talk about drugs or is there 

1258
00:58:04,751 --> 00:58:07,870
something that you want to really 
discuss that you feel like we hit?

1259
00:58:08,020 --> 00:58:09,190
Whatever,
whatever you.

1260
00:58:09,220 --> 00:58:10,310
Whatever you want,
you know,

1261
00:58:10,320 --> 00:58:11,153
they are.
I always say a good interview is when I 

1262
00:58:12,041 --> 00:58:13,750
don't look at the cards as well.
So we did it here.

1263
00:58:13,751 --> 00:58:14,584
All right.
So let's talk about drugs a little bit 

1264
00:58:15,910 --> 00:58:16,743
because I think this is an interesting 
place for the libertarian or classical 

1265
00:58:19,121 --> 00:58:19,954
liberal.
You basically think that our war on 

1266
00:58:22,121 --> 00:58:23,860
drugs,
it was completely ridiculous.

1267
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:26,430
It's one of the worst policies ever.
Yeah.

1268
00:58:26,640 --> 00:58:30,040
Uh,
what would be a better policy related to

1269
00:58:30,080 --> 00:58:32,140
drugs?
I think there are two things to do.

1270
00:58:32,170 --> 00:58:34,810
The first thing is quite simply to 
legalize drugs,

1271
00:58:35,230 --> 00:58:36,610
period across the board,
across the board.

1272
00:58:36,640 --> 00:58:41,170
What people do not realize is until the 
18 nineties,

1273
00:58:41,350 --> 00:58:42,183
any drug was freely available.
If you were in a chemist in Great 

1274
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:46,833
Britain until 1922,
the United States until the age of 90 

1275
00:58:48,440 --> 00:58:49,150
days,
you could go in,

1276
00:58:49,150 --> 00:58:51,220
you could order opm,
you could order morphine.

1277
00:58:51,550 --> 00:58:52,383
Arthur Conan doyle could go to the 
chemist in London and get his weekly 

1278
00:58:55,001 --> 00:58:55,834
supply of cocaine serious coke habit,
which is why Sherlock Holmes has a coke 

1279
00:58:59,711 --> 00:59:00,544
habits in the stories,
so this regime we now have as being 

1280
00:59:05,381 --> 00:59:08,350
created peace mail since the 19 twenties
basically,

1281
00:59:08,380 --> 00:59:09,213
so it's not inevitable.
It's a specific policy response and the 

1282
00:59:12,551 --> 00:59:13,384
results would have been catastrophic.
It has led to incredibly high rates of 

1283
00:59:16,811 --> 00:59:17,644
incarceration here in the United States,
which means countless lives ruined and 

1284
00:59:20,810 --> 00:59:21,643
severely damaged if not destroyed.
It means it's given enormous amounts of 

1285
00:59:25,731 --> 00:59:26,564
money to some seriously evil and 
unpleasant people and led to the growth 

1286
00:59:29,571 --> 00:59:32,630
of an enormous network of international 
organized crime,

1287
00:59:32,810 --> 00:59:34,220
which would not otherwise exist.

1288
00:59:34,550 --> 00:59:35,383
In terms of geopolitics,
this is one of the major ways terrorist 

1289
00:59:37,461 --> 00:59:41,180
organizations get money.
It's a catastrophe in terms of that.

1290
00:59:41,350 --> 00:59:43,550
It's undermine the stability of large 
parts of the world.

1291
00:59:43,551 --> 00:59:44,384
Like Columbia for example.
Increasingly that's one of the reasons 

1292
00:59:46,911 --> 00:59:47,744
why Venezuela was in bad shape quite 
apart from the incompetence of the 

1293
00:59:49,971 --> 00:59:50,804
government of Mexico.
We all know there's like a war going on 

1294
00:59:53,001 --> 00:59:54,320
in some parts of Mexico.
Them,

1295
00:59:54,340 --> 00:59:55,173
okay,
so this is an altar and it hasn't even 

1296
00:59:56,871 --> 01:00:00,140
done the thing is meant to do,
which is reduce the use of drugs.

1297
01:00:00,590 --> 01:00:02,150
In fact,
actually this has gone up.

1298
01:00:02,510 --> 01:00:03,343
Not only that,
but an inevitable result of this policy 

1299
01:00:05,360 --> 01:00:06,193
is that the suppliers and the users both
go for harder drugs because he wants to 

1300
01:00:09,621 --> 01:00:10,454
get more bang for the buck.
You want also to sell and to use 

1301
01:00:13,130 --> 01:00:15,380
products that are less bulky,
easier to conceal.

1302
01:00:15,530 --> 01:00:16,363
Same thing has happened with prohibition
during the 19 twenties were the 

1303
01:00:18,681 --> 01:00:19,514
Americans went from being a beer 
drinking nation to being a hard liquor 

1304
01:00:21,441 --> 01:00:22,274
drinking nation,
which is not what you want and what you 

1305
01:00:24,261 --> 01:00:27,110
want to do is control alcohol trick.
So I would say that this,

1306
01:00:27,111 --> 01:00:31,040
in terms of its own goals,
this is a catastrophic policy failure.

1307
01:00:31,640 --> 01:00:32,810
Now,
having said that,

1308
01:00:33,320 --> 01:00:34,153
I'm not one of these people who is 
channeling Timothy O'leary and thinks 

1309
01:00:36,981 --> 01:00:40,910
that drugs are good for you.
There's no doubt there is a problem with

1310
01:00:40,940 --> 01:00:42,560
widespread use of drugs.
It's worth saying,

1311
01:00:42,561 --> 01:00:44,930
by the way,
that the real problem anyway,

1312
01:00:45,060 --> 01:00:45,893
not least here in the United States,
is the massive increase in the use of 

1313
01:00:48,201 --> 01:00:49,034
prescription drugs.
The number of people who are psycho 

1314
01:00:52,001 --> 01:00:52,834
truck,
big mood altering drugs is staggering 

1315
01:00:55,280 --> 01:00:58,100
and it has grown dramatically since the 
1966.

1316
01:00:58,250 --> 01:01:02,390
So there's a more general problem of 
drug use in advanced countries,

1317
01:01:02,391 --> 01:01:06,400
particularly North America,
of which illegal drug use is a subset.

1318
01:01:06,450 --> 01:01:07,320
Now that,
am I mistaken?

1319
01:01:07,321 --> 01:01:09,630
Are you guys in Britain?
You don't have the commercials we have,

1320
01:01:09,631 --> 01:01:10,830
right?
Are They not legal there?

1321
01:01:10,831 --> 01:01:11,664
We get every commercial on every,
especially on cable news for all of the 

1322
01:01:14,500 --> 01:01:15,333
prescriptions.

1323
01:01:15,810 --> 01:01:16,740
It doesn't,
that's all out now.

1324
01:01:16,741 --> 01:01:18,900
That's best.
That's not allowed under the,

1325
01:01:18,901 --> 01:01:19,734
uh,
you know,

1326
01:01:19,950 --> 01:01:21,870
advertising regulations in the United 
Kingdom.

1327
01:01:22,020 --> 01:01:22,853
That might be a regulation I'd before.
It is strange when you're watching 

1328
01:01:26,310 --> 01:01:27,143
television in the United States to think
just everyone this country suffer from 

1329
01:01:29,251 --> 01:01:30,084
in large.

1330
01:01:30,460 --> 01:01:32,420
Yeah.
You got that on a cartoon,

1331
01:01:32,450 --> 01:01:34,520
a cloud following you.
Anyways,

1332
01:01:34,660 --> 01:01:34,950
so

1333
01:01:34,950 --> 01:01:37,110
the thing is,
what I think is that what you need to do

1334
01:01:37,440 --> 01:01:38,273
is to have a social movement to address 
the undoubted real problems with the 

1335
01:01:43,621 --> 01:01:47,310
drug trade in which you could do.
If the government got out of this and my

1336
01:01:47,311 --> 01:01:48,144
model would be temperance were in the 
19th century at the start of the 19th 

1337
01:01:51,061 --> 01:01:52,680
century,
on both sides of the Atlantic.

1338
01:01:53,280 --> 01:01:55,770
Pretty much everyone was in a drunken 
stupor most of the time.

1339
01:01:55,830 --> 01:01:58,770
The amount of drinking was nominal and 
binding.

1340
01:01:58,771 --> 01:02:00,120
18,
eighties and nineties.

1341
01:02:00,240 --> 01:02:01,073
Most prediction,
the great majority of Americans have 

1342
01:02:02,271 --> 01:02:03,104
become seriously sober.
People who maybe drink very 

1343
01:02:05,311 --> 01:02:07,140
occasionally,
they're not heavy drinkers the way their

1344
01:02:07,141 --> 01:02:09,510
grandparents had been.
That is not due to government.

1345
01:02:09,690 --> 01:02:13,710
It's due to the enormous social movement
of temperance,

1346
01:02:13,920 --> 01:02:14,753
which unfortunately also wanted to use 
the law to stop the residual temp 

1347
01:02:18,420 --> 01:02:20,580
central and drinking.
Even think about smoking.

1348
01:02:20,610 --> 01:02:23,160
Okay.
I'm not keen on all the antismoking laws

1349
01:02:23,161 --> 01:02:23,994
we have,
but on the other hand there's been a 

1350
01:02:24,871 --> 01:02:26,900
huge change in social attitudes to 
smoking,

1351
01:02:26,950 --> 01:02:27,783
just made socially,
just not the thing to do to smoking 

1352
01:02:30,300 --> 01:02:33,030
company.
That's the way to address the underlying

1353
01:02:33,040 --> 01:02:33,873
problem that we have with drugs.
It's through social actual bank kind of 

1354
01:02:35,880 --> 01:02:36,713
war on drugs is actually making that 
kind of effective social action less 

1355
01:02:40,231 --> 01:02:43,920
likely and causing a ton of other 
problems.

1356
01:02:43,950 --> 01:02:44,783
Right.
Is the smoking one must be a tough one 

1357
01:02:46,801 --> 01:02:50,700
for you though because on one hand at 
least here our taxes are incredibly high

1358
01:02:50,701 --> 01:02:51,534
and smoking,
so this is a government so they sort of 

1359
01:02:52,801 --> 01:02:53,634
tried to price it out of the market,
which I guess you wouldn't really well 

1360
01:02:56,491 --> 01:02:58,950
or I don't think the ultra price sound 
market quite more.

1361
01:02:59,010 --> 01:03:01,440
They're trying to maximize their 
revenue,

1362
01:03:01,441 --> 01:03:02,274
which is something different because our
theory of these taxes is they're meant 

1363
01:03:04,351 --> 01:03:04,650
to stop.

1364
01:03:04,650 --> 01:03:05,483
You and I are buying cigarettes,
but actually I don't like the US 

1365
01:03:07,711 --> 01:03:08,544
government.
The British government would have a 

1366
01:03:09,570 --> 01:03:14,340
panic fits if people stop smoking 
because they get 7 billion pounds a year

1367
01:03:14,341 --> 01:03:16,040
of revenue from smoking taxes.
Right.

1368
01:03:16,060 --> 01:03:17,190
So in a weird way,
they need it.

1369
01:03:17,640 --> 01:03:18,750
Exactly.
Plus also,

1370
01:03:19,160 --> 01:03:20,670
um,
they really ought to encourage people to

1371
01:03:20,671 --> 01:03:23,080
smoke because if you smoke you're likely
to die younger.

1372
01:03:23,370 --> 01:03:25,740
You won't be claiming a whole bunch of 
healthcare benefits.

1373
01:03:26,280 --> 01:03:27,113
But no,
the point about that is that that is 

1374
01:03:29,011 --> 01:03:29,844
actually a very bad policy because the 
demand for cigarettes and tobacco 

1375
01:03:33,721 --> 01:03:34,554
products is highly inelastic.
And so what you're doing actually is 

1376
01:03:36,511 --> 01:03:39,360
hurting the poor more than anybody else.
There are other ways of doing it.

1377
01:03:39,480 --> 01:03:40,770
Like I said,
social pressure.

1378
01:03:40,940 --> 01:03:42,630
Yeah.
So what about for the person?

1379
01:03:42,631 --> 01:03:46,170
So I'm pretty much with you on the 
philosophical part of how the government

1380
01:03:46,171 --> 01:03:49,890
should deal with this and the,
and the actual tangible part of drugs.

1381
01:03:50,190 --> 01:03:51,830
I would have some concern if they just 
say if,

1382
01:03:51,960 --> 01:03:54,920
if heroin was lead with legal tomorrow 
and,

1383
01:03:54,921 --> 01:03:57,300
and kids could just get it at a border.
So you look,

1384
01:03:57,360 --> 01:04:00,060
we're here in La,
there are pot stores on every corner.

1385
01:04:00,180 --> 01:04:03,180
I have a law license for it.
So I'm not doing something illegal,

1386
01:04:03,390 --> 01:04:04,770
but what,
what do you do for the real.

1387
01:04:04,800 --> 01:04:06,930
I'm not even talking about the Timothy 
leary mushroom stuff,

1388
01:04:06,960 --> 01:04:07,793
you know,
I would have met them really addictive 

1389
01:04:09,360 --> 01:04:10,193
stuff.
Well actually meet some of the drugs 

1390
01:04:12,001 --> 01:04:12,834
that are on.
I'd be much more worried about things 

1391
01:04:14,251 --> 01:04:17,270
like sedatives or cocaine.
The level would be heroin actually.

1392
01:04:17,370 --> 01:04:18,450
Interesting.
But that's another matter.

1393
01:04:18,690 --> 01:04:21,840
Um,
the thing is to say that drugs should be

1394
01:04:21,841 --> 01:04:23,610
sold legally,
does not mean that to be a complete free

1395
01:04:23,611 --> 01:04:25,980
for all a,
they would clearly be regulations,

1396
01:04:25,981 --> 01:04:27,780
for example,
saying that people cannot buy them below

1397
01:04:27,781 --> 01:04:30,660
a certain age just as we have with 
alcohol and tobacco for good reason.

1398
01:04:30,750 --> 01:04:31,583
Because you,
you'd think that somebody under a 

1399
01:04:32,491 --> 01:04:34,440
certain age,
which you set arbitrarily,

1400
01:04:34,441 --> 01:04:37,140
it does not have the judgment to know 
whether or not they should do this.

1401
01:04:37,330 --> 01:04:38,820
And you should enforce laws on that 
very,

1402
01:04:38,821 --> 01:04:40,320
very strictly and very,
very firmly.

1403
01:04:40,530 --> 01:04:41,363
You might well have a system where 
certain categories of drugs or 

1404
01:04:44,550 --> 01:04:45,750
substances,
you basically say,

1405
01:04:45,751 --> 01:04:46,870
well,
uh,

1406
01:04:47,400 --> 01:04:48,233
you could do with the Swedish government
tried alcohol and have a rationing 

1407
01:04:50,250 --> 01:04:52,140
system.
There are various ways around that.

1408
01:04:52,260 --> 01:04:53,640
The point is it wouldn't be just a case 
of,

1409
01:04:53,670 --> 01:04:54,503
oh,
you can walk into any store and just 

1410
01:04:55,680 --> 01:04:58,380
buying your your shots of morphine and 
heroin over the counter,

1411
01:04:58,381 --> 01:05:02,380
like almost certainly there'll be a 
whole array of a legislation.

1412
01:05:02,410 --> 01:05:03,243
The point is it will be sold by a legal 
retailer who would have strong 

1413
01:05:06,751 --> 01:05:07,584
incentives to have high quality product,
not to sell it to people who are going 

1414
01:05:10,531 --> 01:05:11,364
to be problematic in one way or another 
because they would have a vicarious 

1415
01:05:13,621 --> 01:05:15,240
liability under the law,
for example,

1416
01:05:15,510 --> 01:05:16,343
and unlike the situation,
the where that being sold by seriously 

1417
01:05:19,001 --> 01:05:22,810
dodgy people,
criminals of the worst kind who actually

1418
01:05:22,811 --> 01:05:27,811
have an incentive to not care about who 
they sell it to sell it.

1419
01:05:28,340 --> 01:05:31,690
So actually if you're concerned about 
protecting vulnerable people,

1420
01:05:31,910 --> 01:05:33,570
which is what we're talking about here.
Yeah.

1421
01:05:33,700 --> 01:05:38,700
Then actually making the sale of this 
substance legal is the way to go because

1422
01:05:38,711 --> 01:05:39,544
it means that you're much more likely to
be able to look out for their interests 

1423
01:05:41,381 --> 01:05:44,950
and the sellers are much less likely to 
have an incentive to screw them over,

1424
01:05:44,951 --> 01:05:45,600
to be blunt.

1425
01:05:45,600 --> 01:05:46,620
Right.
And interestingly,

1426
01:05:46,621 --> 01:05:48,600
it gets back to sort of what's been the 
through line here,

1427
01:05:48,601 --> 01:05:51,960
which is that a little government 
involvement in a certain way.

1428
01:05:51,961 --> 01:05:52,381
It could be.
Okay.

1429
01:05:52,381 --> 01:05:53,214
So I almost think,
I almost think that my new phrase now 

1430
01:05:55,261 --> 01:05:57,210
when people say classical,
what's a classical liberal?

1431
01:05:57,450 --> 01:06:00,090
I almost think it's a realistic 
libertarian.

1432
01:06:00,120 --> 01:06:00,430
Do you think

1433
01:06:00,430 --> 01:06:02,050
that's a good way of putting it?
Yes,

1434
01:06:02,051 --> 01:06:02,884
absolutely.
And I mean the thing is say very often 

1435
01:06:04,571 --> 01:06:05,404
limited government and small limited 
government even more so is a lot more 

1436
01:06:09,221 --> 01:06:12,820
effective at achieving the ends that big
government liberals wanted to have.

1437
01:06:12,920 --> 01:06:15,250
The big government is very good than 
here.

1438
01:06:15,440 --> 01:06:17,000
I think that's a perfect way to end 
this.

1439
01:06:17,001 --> 01:06:19,000
It's been a pleasure.
I didn't look down lines.

1440
01:06:19,080 --> 01:06:20,460
That's how I know it's a good one.
Uh,

1441
01:06:20,640 --> 01:06:22,130
for more.
I Dr Steve Davies,

Thanks for watching.

1444

We'll do it again next week.
