1
00:00:05,150 --> 00:00:09,530
So Monday was my 41st birthday and this 
helium inflated storm troopers showed up

2
00:00:09,531 --> 00:00:10,364
at my door and I couldn't possibly pass 
up the opportunity to use him as both a 

3
00:00:13,521 --> 00:00:16,520
prop and a metaphor for this week's 
direct message.

4
00:00:16,820 --> 00:00:17,653
One of the ideas which keeps popping up 
in the discussions we're having around 

5
00:00:19,851 --> 00:00:20,684
here is that old political labels are 
becoming more and more meaningless by 

6
00:00:23,901 --> 00:00:24,734
the day.
The terms progressive and liberal had 

7
00:00:27,021 --> 00:00:29,360
virtually nothing to do with each other 
anymore.

8
00:00:29,510 --> 00:00:33,020
And if you're a classical liberal,
you're certainly not a leftist.

9
00:00:33,350 --> 00:00:36,950
Conservative and Republican don't have 
much to do with each other today.

10
00:00:37,100 --> 00:00:37,933
As trump,
a populist who doesn't focus on social 

11
00:00:40,521 --> 00:00:41,354
issues like gay marriage and legalizing 
marijuana is now the leader of the gop 

12
00:00:45,590 --> 00:00:50,510
for these reasons as well as the real 
time crumbling of our mainstream media.

13
00:00:50,511 --> 00:00:55,340
The battle for freedom now is between 
the authoritarians and the Libertarians.

14
00:00:55,670 --> 00:00:56,503
That is the battle over the soul of 
America and the West in general is now 

15
00:00:59,841 --> 00:01:00,674
about people who want the government to 
have more control over your life versus 

16
00:01:03,801 --> 00:01:06,890
the people who want the government to 
have less control over your life.

17
00:01:07,130 --> 00:01:07,963
I think that by now you probably know 
that I fall solidly in the camp of the 

18
00:01:11,631 --> 00:01:15,530
people who want the government to have 
less control over how you live,

19
00:01:15,860 --> 00:01:16,693
and that brings me to my friendly and 
trustee storm trooper beside me in the 

20
00:01:21,051 --> 00:01:21,884
original 1977 star wars.
The storm troopers were the foot 

21
00:01:25,041 --> 00:01:25,874
soldiers for the Galactic Republic,
a massive evil military regime who 

22
00:01:30,081 --> 00:01:33,440
wanted to control every star system in 
the galaxy.

23
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:34,513
This would qualify as authoritarian.
The empire and the storm troopers were 

24
00:01:38,271 --> 00:01:41,300
not keepers of the piece as the emperor 
had promised,

25
00:01:41,630 --> 00:01:46,250
but authoritarian rulers who wanted to 
end this the expand their power,

26
00:01:46,430 --> 00:01:47,263
hence they're building of the death star
to blow up any planet which didn't fall 

27
00:01:50,001 --> 00:01:51,320
in line with their desires.

28
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:54,650
Blowing up a planet is a pretty good way
to get people to do what you want.

29
00:01:55,390 --> 00:01:57,380
A dare I talk about the prequels,
but trust me,

30
00:01:57,381 --> 00:01:58,214
it works with this metaphor.
Two thousand to star wars episode to 

31
00:02:01,101 --> 00:02:01,934
attack of the clones takes place about 
20 years before the original star wars 

32
00:02:06,530 --> 00:02:09,590
in this film,
the storm troopers at that time known as

33
00:02:09,591 --> 00:02:12,020
the clone troopers,
were the good guys.

34
00:02:12,290 --> 00:02:16,250
They allied with the Jetta in defense of
the Democratic Republic.

35
00:02:16,580 --> 00:02:17,413
Eventually Chancellor Palpatine,
who had consolidated power himself and 

36
00:02:20,421 --> 00:02:22,790
secretly ordered the creation of the 
clone army,

37
00:02:23,060 --> 00:02:23,893
took control of the storm troopers and 
the Senate and use democracy against 

38
00:02:27,891 --> 00:02:32,891
itself at the same time,
going from chancellor to emperor in 2015

39
00:02:33,431 --> 00:02:34,264
is the force awakens,
which takes place about 20 years after 

40
00:02:36,981 --> 00:02:37,814
the original trilogy.
The storm troopers are again the bad 

41
00:02:40,491 --> 00:02:41,324
guys.
This time in the form of the soldiers 

42
00:02:42,591 --> 00:02:43,424
for the authoritarian first order,
which has risen from the ashes of the 

43
00:02:48,470 --> 00:02:48,860
Galactic Republic.

44
00:02:48,860 --> 00:02:52,340
One of the heroes of the story,
Finn is a storm trooper gone rogue,

45
00:02:52,341 --> 00:02:55,940
who suddenly realizes that he as an end 
of individual,

46
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:58,460
can chart his own destiny.
He puts,

47
00:02:58,461 --> 00:03:02,320
his collective is passed as a storm 
trooper behind him and he becomes one of

48
00:03:02,321 --> 00:03:03,154
the heroes of the story.
The point of all of this is that it 

49
00:03:05,830 --> 00:03:06,663
isn't this storm trooper,
you should fear it's the power which 

50
00:03:09,851 --> 00:03:10,684
commands him.
Any ideology can be used as a force for 

51
00:03:13,901 --> 00:03:14,734
good or for evil,
and that's why we should be reigning in 

52
00:03:17,441 --> 00:03:18,274
authoritarianism of any kind,
even when it's your sort of 

53
00:03:21,821 --> 00:03:22,654
authoritarianism in charge.
This whole metaphor took place in a 

54
00:03:26,201 --> 00:03:27,730
galaxy far,
far away,

55
00:03:27,731 --> 00:03:31,690
but the lessons that it presents are 
ones we can use right here on earth.

56
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:36,790
Joining me to discuss authoritarianism,
burst libertarianism is author,

57
00:03:36,791 --> 00:03:39,550
professor and podcast or fattiest 
Russell,

58
00:03:39,820 --> 00:03:40,653
our friends with learn liberty if send 
them our way and to loosely quote Obi 

59
00:03:43,331 --> 00:03:44,164
wan Kenobi.
This is the episode you've been looking 

60
00:03:46,211 --> 00:03:47,044
for.

61
00:03:51,630 --> 00:03:55,500
We're continuing our partnership with 
learn liberty today and joining me is an

62
00:03:55,501 --> 00:03:56,334
adjunct professor at William at 
University and author of a renegade 

63
00:03:59,281 --> 00:04:02,100
history of the United States.
That is Russell.

64
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:03,750
Welcome to the Rubin report.
Thanks for having me.

65
00:04:04,300 --> 00:04:06,510
That he is Russell.
That is a name.

66
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:10,350
Sure is of a man who I feel knows what 
he's saying.

67
00:04:10,351 --> 00:04:13,140
You know what I mean?
Like there's some Gravitas to your name.

68
00:04:13,470 --> 00:04:15,210
Do you feel that,
first of all,

69
00:04:15,211 --> 00:04:16,480
my mother gets all the credit,
you know,

70
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:19,020
people sort of a compliment me on my 
name all the time and I say,

71
00:04:19,050 --> 00:04:20,010
Hey,
I had nothing to do with it.

72
00:04:20,020 --> 00:04:20,853
I wish I could take credit for it,
but do you see that as the like just a 

73
00:04:25,110 --> 00:04:29,460
hideous and it's unfortunate because 
then I have to be good.

74
00:04:29,580 --> 00:04:30,413
Yeah.
I have to sort of say things that make 

75
00:04:31,771 --> 00:04:33,450
sense and it's a lot of pressure for me.

76
00:04:33,700 --> 00:04:35,100
Yeah,
you just put on me.

77
00:04:35,101 --> 00:04:37,090
Thanks.
I just put an extra dose.

78
00:04:37,091 --> 00:04:37,924
If right now for an hour you're going to
have to make perfect sense because you 

79
00:04:40,921 --> 00:04:42,960
know about this.
This is the internet pipe.

80
00:04:42,980 --> 00:04:45,030
Perfect sense coming up.
Video.

81
00:04:45,031 --> 00:04:47,370
People are going to judge every word 
that comes out of your mouth.

82
00:04:47,430 --> 00:04:48,360
Yeah,
I've noticed that,

83
00:04:48,740 --> 00:04:51,330
but I'm looking forward to this because 
we're going to talk about postmodernism.

84
00:04:51,331 --> 00:04:54,570
I think you have a slightly different 
take than some of my previous guests.

85
00:04:54,571 --> 00:04:56,940
You have an interesting history,
so let's just dive into it.

86
00:04:57,300 --> 00:05:01,650
You grew up in a Marxists household in 
Berkeley,

87
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:04,800
California.
I've given a lot of good buzzwords right

88
00:05:04,801 --> 00:05:05,940
there.
In that first sentence,

89
00:05:05,941 --> 00:05:08,220
what was that like?
You could also have said the sixties and

90
00:05:08,221 --> 00:05:10,800
seventies when I was growing up.
Yeah,

91
00:05:10,950 --> 00:05:12,480
that's a lot.
I'd be right there.

92
00:05:12,481 --> 00:05:13,740
That's a lot.
Plus that name,

93
00:05:13,770 --> 00:05:14,270
that Israel.

94
00:05:14,270 --> 00:05:16,800
So we combine things here.
I'm kind of done.

95
00:05:16,801 --> 00:05:19,100
I mean we can stop the interview now.
Yeah.

96
00:05:19,110 --> 00:05:19,943
No.
My parents were members of a small 

97
00:05:22,650 --> 00:05:23,483
Trotskyist sect.
It was called the international 

98
00:05:25,531 --> 00:05:30,360
socialists and what they did was they 
industrialized,

99
00:05:30,361 --> 00:05:31,194
which meant that they left their 
middleclass lives and went into heavy 

100
00:05:34,441 --> 00:05:37,710
industry and to organize the proletariat
for revolution.

101
00:05:37,740 --> 00:05:38,573
So my mother became a clerical worker to
organize the secretaries for revolution 

102
00:05:42,791 --> 00:05:43,624
and my stepfather,
who had gone to Exeter Academy and the 

103
00:05:47,670 --> 00:05:48,503
University of Chicago,
he left his world to become a 

104
00:05:49,981 --> 00:05:50,814
steelworker and a truck driver.
And his mission was to convince the 

105
00:05:54,241 --> 00:05:57,180
workers to rise up and bring about a 
communist revolution.

106
00:05:57,800 --> 00:06:02,120
So that was unsuccessful and know what 
caused them to do it.

107
00:06:02,121 --> 00:06:02,954
Was it just generally what was happening
around then with the ward and it's hard 

108
00:06:05,701 --> 00:06:06,534
to.
It's hard to explain why people come to 

109
00:06:08,091 --> 00:06:12,320
particular ideologies,
but they chose Berkeley and the sixties,

110
00:06:12,321 --> 00:06:16,910
they moved there and fell in with this 
hardcore group and that's,

111
00:06:16,970 --> 00:06:17,780
that was their lives.

112
00:06:17,780 --> 00:06:18,613
And so that was my life when I was 
growing up and we had meetings in our 

113
00:06:22,131 --> 00:06:25,700
house and the comrades were sitting down
downstairs and talking about stuff.

114
00:06:25,701 --> 00:06:27,350
I had no idea what they're talking 
about.

115
00:06:27,351 --> 00:06:29,360
I learned later,
but you know,

116
00:06:29,361 --> 00:06:30,194
it was heavy Marxist theory and which,
which a union shop should we infiltrate 

117
00:06:35,091 --> 00:06:36,970
and which factory should we organize.
And,

118
00:06:37,130 --> 00:06:39,020
and then there were visitors to our 
house,

119
00:06:39,021 --> 00:06:40,280
you know,
there were black panthers.

120
00:06:40,281 --> 00:06:43,460
We lived about three blocks from the 
black panthers national headquarters,

121
00:06:43,461 --> 00:06:45,260
which was actually in Berkeley and not 
in Oakland.

122
00:06:45,810 --> 00:06:49,010
Um,
and they were around and sort of hippies

123
00:06:49,011 --> 00:06:53,600
were around and members of the IRA came 
and gave speeches and stuff like that.

124
00:06:53,601 --> 00:06:54,740
So,
and my mother,

125
00:06:54,830 --> 00:06:58,320
one of the interesting things is that my
mother was the dominant figure in my,

126
00:06:58,340 --> 00:06:59,173
in my family.
She was the heavy duty intellectual 

127
00:07:00,741 --> 00:07:01,574
actually.

128
00:07:01,820 --> 00:07:06,820
And so the idea of women being weak or 
victimized or unable to compete with men

129
00:07:09,801 --> 00:07:11,470
has always been just a weird thing for 
me.

130
00:07:11,510 --> 00:07:12,343
Alien idea,
because she was always the dominant 

131
00:07:14,061 --> 00:07:17,360
force and I always looked up to her and 
try to model myself after her.

132
00:07:17,930 --> 00:07:18,763
So were you.
Once you became of age and started 

133
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:21,793
thinking about these ideas,
did you immediately jive with these 

134
00:07:24,261 --> 00:07:26,800
ideas?
Did you have pushback or.

135
00:07:27,370 --> 00:07:29,090
So I will say this.
My parents,

136
00:07:29,180 --> 00:07:32,330
as I recall,
did not try to indoctrinate me directly,

137
00:07:32,810 --> 00:07:34,010
but you can't help it,
right?

138
00:07:34,011 --> 00:07:34,521
I mean,
if you're.

139
00:07:34,521 --> 00:07:38,450
If you're raised in a church family,
you're gonna think that that's the truth

140
00:07:38,451 --> 00:07:40,790
and correct and the way to be.
And that's what I said.

141
00:07:40,791 --> 00:07:42,740
I mean,
my mother said that inspect.

142
00:07:42,741 --> 00:07:45,350
You said this in one of her speeches 
that when I was about 10 years old,

143
00:07:45,351 --> 00:07:47,320
she said,
I want to grow up to be in the IAS.

144
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:49,730
That's what I want to be.
I'm going to be a socialist model.

145
00:07:49,731 --> 00:07:50,564
How do I do that?
And that was kind of my mission and it 

146
00:07:52,401 --> 00:07:53,900
really means that it's.
When I went to college,

147
00:07:53,901 --> 00:07:57,140
I didn't know what socialism even was,
and so that was my.

148
00:07:57,290 --> 00:07:59,300
I said this,
I said I'm going to learn what socialism

149
00:07:59,301 --> 00:08:03,220
is and then become a socialist and sort 
of what I did for awhile.

150
00:08:03,310 --> 00:08:04,150
Uh,
and,

151
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:05,510
but that,
that were off.

152
00:08:06,230 --> 00:08:07,063
So you,
you write a lot and you talk about the 

153
00:08:10,660 --> 00:08:12,450
outsiders.
Really the rebels,

154
00:08:12,980 --> 00:08:14,630
the people,
the drunks,

155
00:08:14,631 --> 00:08:15,464
the fringes of society,
the people that were probably add a lot 

156
00:08:17,811 --> 00:08:21,300
of these meetings now you don't know.
No,

157
00:08:21,310 --> 00:08:22,210
not the people.
No,

158
00:08:22,350 --> 00:08:22,791
that's.
No,

159
00:08:22,791 --> 00:08:24,110
that's a misconception about.
Yeah,

160
00:08:24,140 --> 00:08:24,973
my work.
So it's okay.

161
00:08:25,250 --> 00:08:26,083
Please clean it up.
Yeah.

162
00:08:26,090 --> 00:08:26,391
No,
no.

163
00:08:26,391 --> 00:08:28,550
Um,
so know the people well,

164
00:08:28,551 --> 00:08:29,031
okay.
Let me,

165
00:08:29,031 --> 00:08:30,610
let me tell you how I got there for.

166
00:08:30,620 --> 00:08:33,140
So I ended up going to Antioch College 
in Ohio,

167
00:08:33,141 --> 00:08:38,090
which is this ultra ultra left college 
run by hippies and anarchist basically,

168
00:08:38,260 --> 00:08:39,740
and,
and punk rockers.

169
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:42,020
And in fact we use,
that's evergreen state.

170
00:08:42,140 --> 00:08:42,973
I was just gonna say mean.
We used to compete with evergreen for 

171
00:08:46,491 --> 00:08:47,324
being the most politically correct,
the most left wing college in the 

172
00:08:49,461 --> 00:08:50,480
country.
And we always thought,

173
00:08:50,481 --> 00:08:51,860
oh,
they don't know what they're doing.

174
00:08:51,861 --> 00:08:54,560
We are the true radical college.
That's hilarious.

175
00:08:54,590 --> 00:08:55,860
I think we,
the champions,

176
00:08:55,861 --> 00:08:57,600
and there's,
I have a lot of stories I could tell you

177
00:08:57,601 --> 00:08:58,434
about the insanity at Antioch College,
which is kind of one of the reasons I 

178
00:09:00,631 --> 00:09:04,530
started to think twice about this.
Politics and culture.

179
00:09:04,531 --> 00:09:05,364
And can you give me one example is just,
let's just dive into that one second 

180
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:11,250
because that's this interesting.
Let me give you two.

181
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:17,100
One is just sort of tragic and 
disgusting and the other more comical,

182
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:20,070
the tragic and disgusting one was the.

183
00:09:20,070 --> 00:09:23,010
There were two kids at Antioch when I'm 
in my third year who had,

184
00:09:23,011 --> 00:09:25,740
um,
an antichristian art exhibit.

185
00:09:25,890 --> 00:09:26,723
And so they had crosses on the wall and 
they had a fire in a barrel in the 

186
00:09:30,390 --> 00:09:31,223
middle of the room.
And at one point they took one of the 

187
00:09:32,431 --> 00:09:34,770
crosses down and threw it in the barrel.
Right?

188
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:38,040
Everyone there understood this was an 
antichristian statement.

189
00:09:38,310 --> 00:09:39,900
Oh No,
this was racism.

190
00:09:39,930 --> 00:09:43,350
This was the Ku Klux Klan.
Those kids got expelled.

191
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:46,200
Wow.
Because it was widely perceived to be an

192
00:09:46,201 --> 00:09:48,020
act of,
you know,

193
00:09:48,420 --> 00:09:49,253
racist violence,
and they had to leave the college and I 

194
00:09:51,571 --> 00:09:53,610
was the editor of the newspaper at the 
time and I said,

195
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:56,010
this is kind of my turning point for me.
I said,

196
00:09:56,070 --> 00:09:57,810
what are you talking about?
This is insane.

197
00:09:57,811 --> 00:10:02,811
It really had this witch hunt feel on 
campus and it felt I felt guilty and bad

198
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:06,870
for having to come to their defense 
simply to explain.

199
00:10:07,260 --> 00:10:10,310
That had nothing to do with race at all 
and then.

200
00:10:10,470 --> 00:10:11,303
And that there was that,
there was this hysteria that really 

201
00:10:13,741 --> 00:10:15,000
takes no prisoners.
I mean,

202
00:10:15,001 --> 00:10:15,834
you have to be,
you have to eliminate the evil once you 

203
00:10:17,251 --> 00:10:18,084
identify it.
Why do you think that that ideology 

204
00:10:22,021 --> 00:10:22,854
breeds that hysteria?
Because we're seeing this literally 

205
00:10:24,631 --> 00:10:25,710
right now.
Yeah.

206
00:10:25,711 --> 00:10:27,510
There's something that goes on in 
college campuses.

207
00:10:27,540 --> 00:10:28,373
Actually,
my mother said this to me when that 

208
00:10:30,001 --> 00:10:30,631
happened.
She said,

209
00:10:30,631 --> 00:10:31,290
well,
you know what?

210
00:10:31,290 --> 00:10:34,050
They need the devil.
They need to have a devil.

211
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:35,993
As soon as you step on campus,
you start reading about the history of 

212
00:10:37,501 --> 00:10:38,334
oppression and you know,
I think a lot of that's correct in many 

213
00:10:40,171 --> 00:10:41,004
ways.
Uh,

214
00:10:41,070 --> 00:10:44,310
there's a lot of bad things that have 
happened in this country and elsewhere.

215
00:10:45,150 --> 00:10:47,790
And then you look around and you're an 
affluent,

216
00:10:47,850 --> 00:10:49,770
very privileged person in this world.

217
00:10:49,770 --> 00:10:53,700
You're in the top one percent or more,
every college student basically is that,

218
00:10:53,701 --> 00:10:56,490
especially at Antioch.
So there is no devil,

219
00:10:56,491 --> 00:10:58,230
there is no,
there is no bull connor,

220
00:10:58,260 --> 00:10:59,093
you know,
there,

221
00:10:59,210 --> 00:11:01,080
there,
there's no one like that around here.

222
00:11:01,081 --> 00:11:01,914
So you have to find one.
And so what we did was we kind of 

223
00:11:04,110 --> 00:11:04,943
focused on that administrators,
the president and his evil 

224
00:11:08,221 --> 00:11:11,300
administrators.
We just inherently have to be eve.

225
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:13,950
We assumed they were evil and they were 
out to get us.

226
00:11:13,951 --> 00:11:16,350
And so we had to get them.
And so one day,

227
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:17,273
uh,
two kids broken when night two kids 

228
00:11:18,721 --> 00:11:22,560
broke into the president's office and 
took a shit on his desk.

229
00:11:23,670 --> 00:11:25,410
And that was our,
that was our statement.

230
00:11:26,010 --> 00:11:27,840
That was,
that was telling him who is,

231
00:11:27,841 --> 00:11:30,060
who works at many levels and what was,
what,

232
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:33,001
uh,
yeah.

233
00:11:33,001 --> 00:11:33,834
So,
I mean those are just two of the most 

234
00:11:34,531 --> 00:11:35,410
comical,
uh,

235
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:36,333
you know,
are worst things that happened at 

236
00:11:37,231 --> 00:11:38,064
Antioch in that way.

237
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:40,410
It was also very liberating place.
I mean,

238
00:11:40,411 --> 00:11:43,140
there was a lot of the hippies were good
in some ways.

239
00:11:43,141 --> 00:11:43,974
I mean there was a lot of nudity and 
smoking pot and lots of sexual freedom 

240
00:11:47,101 --> 00:11:50,520
which has gone now and college campuses 
and I love that stuff,

241
00:11:50,850 --> 00:11:51,683
but I hated this puritanical wing 
culture and that's when I started to 

242
00:11:55,271 --> 00:11:58,000
move against it.
And then I went to Columbia for graduate

243
00:11:58,001 --> 00:12:03,001
school and everybody there is a Marxist 
or a socialist or maybe a new deal,

244
00:12:03,461 --> 00:12:05,140
liberal,
but everybody's on the left.

245
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:06,033
Everybody.
And this was upper west side of 

246
00:12:06,671 --> 00:12:07,580
Manhattan as you know.
And,

247
00:12:08,670 --> 00:12:09,503
and I,
I needed to be a socialist and so I 

248
00:12:11,441 --> 00:12:12,274
started to study as hard as I could to 
be a socialist and be a socialist 

249
00:12:14,411 --> 00:12:16,690
historian,
be I became a Labor historian,

250
00:12:16,691 --> 00:12:19,750
which is what you're supposed to do.
But I started noticing that all of these

251
00:12:19,751 --> 00:12:22,630
people didn't care what clothes they 
wore.

252
00:12:22,630 --> 00:12:24,370
They had no idea what movies were 
applying.

253
00:12:24,371 --> 00:12:25,204
They never watched television.
They were completely oblivious to the 

254
00:12:27,461 --> 00:12:29,380
lives of real people.
And in particular,

255
00:12:29,381 --> 00:12:30,214
we actually,
I'd say they were actually hostile to 

256
00:12:31,601 --> 00:12:35,530
the ways in which ordinary Americans 
chose to spend their leisure time.

257
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:37,870
So popular culture was something that 
was bad.

258
00:12:38,890 --> 00:12:40,600
It was a false consciousness,
in fact,

259
00:12:40,601 --> 00:12:41,434
right?
This is a,

260
00:12:41,590 --> 00:12:43,150
this is an idea from the Frankfurt 
school,

261
00:12:43,151 --> 00:12:44,470
from Adorno.
He said this,

262
00:12:44,710 --> 00:12:45,543
he said,
popular culture is simply the way the 

263
00:12:47,831 --> 00:12:50,980
capitalist class maintains control.
And so we must do away with it.

264
00:12:51,550 --> 00:12:52,480
I said,
that's awful.

265
00:12:52,940 --> 00:12:55,120
It's,
it's worse than off totalitarian.

266
00:12:55,780 --> 00:12:59,290
There's many arguments for saying that a
lot of pop culture is nonsense.

267
00:12:59,291 --> 00:13:01,000
It dribble.
And I mock it constantly.

268
00:13:01,300 --> 00:13:04,060
Um,
but also people need an escape.

269
00:13:04,090 --> 00:13:05,980
It's also part of human nature.
It's,

270
00:13:05,981 --> 00:13:06,814
it's,
these are the things that rise up that 

271
00:13:08,260 --> 00:13:09,640
had some resonance with people.

272
00:13:09,700 --> 00:13:11,410
I want to say it's better than an 
escape.

273
00:13:11,470 --> 00:13:15,340
So you know,
a lot of my work is about puritanism and

274
00:13:15,341 --> 00:13:16,174
its long history and people aren't 
really aware of how it carries through 

275
00:13:18,881 --> 00:13:20,480
to today.
So the,

276
00:13:20,490 --> 00:13:21,323
that the heart of the pure of puritanism
is the puritan work ethic and a lot of 

277
00:13:24,071 --> 00:13:24,904
people get confused about this.
They think it's a working hard to get a 

278
00:13:26,861 --> 00:13:29,050
nice house or a big television or a nice
car.

279
00:13:29,051 --> 00:13:29,884
It's not.
It's the idea that work in itself no 

280
00:13:32,201 --> 00:13:33,034
matter what you get for it is virtuous.
So you should work all the time no 

281
00:13:36,101 --> 00:13:36,934
matter what you get for it.
I'm so popular culture in this country 

282
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:42,290
since it started in early 19th 
centuries,

283
00:13:42,310 --> 00:13:45,070
always been an a and not just an escape 
from that.

284
00:13:45,340 --> 00:13:46,173
It's been,
in a way a repudiation of that because 

285
00:13:47,711 --> 00:13:52,600
the puritans and their descendants,
the victorians in the 19th century said,

286
00:13:52,900 --> 00:13:54,130
all these things are terrible.

287
00:13:54,130 --> 00:13:56,770
At that time it was dime novels,
which were the first novels,

288
00:13:56,771 --> 00:13:59,380
you know,
it was going to the nickelodeons,

289
00:13:59,410 --> 00:14:02,110
it was gambling was going to the horse 
races,

290
00:14:02,111 --> 00:14:03,190
sports,
all that stuff.

291
00:14:03,191 --> 00:14:04,750
They said,
we can't do that.

292
00:14:05,260 --> 00:14:06,460
That's,
that's evil.

293
00:14:06,461 --> 00:14:08,650
That's Satan's work.
We must avoid that.

294
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:11,560
We must work all the time and raise our 
families and that's it.

295
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:12,753
So popular culture for me has 
essentially been a repudiation of the 

296
00:14:16,901 --> 00:14:17,734
puritan work ethic.
It's always been this counter force 

297
00:14:21,041 --> 00:14:24,490
against that in our culture and there's 
this constant fight between the two.

298
00:14:24,491 --> 00:14:26,680
So you'll see,
like in politics,

299
00:14:26,681 --> 00:14:27,514
politicians,
you won't find a president or a senator 

300
00:14:29,231 --> 00:14:33,730
until Donald trump actually who hasn't 
criticised popular culture in some way.

301
00:14:33,970 --> 00:14:35,500
Right?
Because they are.

302
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:39,760
They have to be the models of the sort 
of puritanical repressive.

303
00:14:39,761 --> 00:14:42,040
Good American guy.
Thanks a lot.

304
00:14:42,180 --> 00:14:42,650
Hi.
No,

305
00:14:42,650 --> 00:14:43,460
sorry.
No,

306
00:14:43,460 --> 00:14:43,691
no,
no,

307
00:14:43,691 --> 00:14:45,430
that's great.
So is there,

308
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:46,353
when you're discussing this,
it sounds like there's a religious 

309
00:14:47,831 --> 00:14:50,730
connotation there and when people hear 
the word puritanical,

310
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:52,160
they think of a religious

311
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:54,170
connection,
but in and of itself,

312
00:14:54,171 --> 00:14:56,030
there isn't really a religious 
connection,

313
00:14:56,031 --> 00:14:56,510
right?
There's,

314
00:14:56,510 --> 00:15:00,590
there's the ideas of a religious 
authority or something like that,

315
00:15:00,591 --> 00:15:01,910
but it's not religious per se.

316
00:15:01,990 --> 00:15:05,500
It's not necessarily religious.
Another argument I make,

317
00:15:05,560 --> 00:15:07,090
and I think this might resonate with 
you,

318
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:08,433
is that modern day progressivism and 
left politics generally is secular 

319
00:15:12,581 --> 00:15:14,590
religion.
It's really secular Christianity.

320
00:15:14,620 --> 00:15:16,540
So in particular,
I mean,

321
00:15:16,541 --> 00:15:17,800
I think it's,
you see,

322
00:15:17,801 --> 00:15:20,590
you see,
you see a lot of puritanism in left wing

323
00:15:20,591 --> 00:15:22,540
politics and that's been true for a 
long,

324
00:15:22,541 --> 00:15:23,374
long time.
There's actually a couple of very good 

325
00:15:24,851 --> 00:15:28,600
books about um,
are showing that left wing intellectuals

326
00:15:28,601 --> 00:15:29,434
for the last hundred years have been a 
uniformly hostile to popular culture 

327
00:15:33,130 --> 00:15:33,963
that until very recently the sort of 
hipster communists and Brooklyn talk 

328
00:15:37,060 --> 00:15:38,620
about pop culture until them

329
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:41,160
who all were the same glasses at the 
same facial hair.

330
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:43,520
They pretend they do and I've had 
arguments with them.

331
00:15:43,521 --> 00:15:47,210
They picked hand that Lenin loved,
loved the movies.

332
00:15:47,211 --> 00:15:48,460
No,
I mean Marx,

333
00:15:48,470 --> 00:15:49,700
Lenin,
Trotsky,

334
00:15:50,030 --> 00:15:50,863
all of them,
you name it and all the intellectuals 

335
00:15:52,921 --> 00:15:55,790
and the universities who are,
who are on the left have all like Adorno

336
00:15:55,820 --> 00:15:59,480
have all hated pop culture and seeing it
as false consciousness.

337
00:15:59,481 --> 00:16:00,314
Because,
and I said this once to professor at 

338
00:16:01,281 --> 00:16:04,100
Columbia,
very prestigious feminist gender studies

339
00:16:04,101 --> 00:16:05,720
professor wants.
I said,

340
00:16:05,721 --> 00:16:06,920
why?
Why do you,

341
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:07,873
why do you hate the fact that so many 
women just like to go shopping or like 

342
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:12,110
to go to the movies?
And she said,

343
00:16:12,740 --> 00:16:14,930
because I think they have better things 
to do with their time,

344
00:16:15,830 --> 00:16:16,611
I mean,
right?

345
00:16:16,611 --> 00:16:20,630
So that's judge.
So it's elitist,

346
00:16:20,631 --> 00:16:23,480
it's judgmental,
it's at least authoritarian.

347
00:16:23,481 --> 00:16:26,900
I think it might be totalitarian.
And this is my critique of the Frankfurt

348
00:16:26,901 --> 00:16:28,430
school,
not postmodernism.

349
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:32,290
Different things by the way.
I do want to get very different things.

350
00:16:32,310 --> 00:16:33,143
Um,
to me it's totalitarian because their 

351
00:16:34,821 --> 00:16:38,660
idea is that your ideas are wrong.
False.

352
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:41,960
That's their term.
They use that and they're leading you to

353
00:16:41,961 --> 00:16:44,780
do things that are counter to your own 
interests.

354
00:16:44,900 --> 00:16:45,733
So we know what your own interests are 
and we know how you should best arrive 

355
00:16:50,211 --> 00:16:54,560
at them to gain them.
So we're going to tell you what music to

356
00:16:54,561 --> 00:16:56,930
listen to,
what movies to go see.

357
00:16:56,931 --> 00:16:59,330
Probably no movies,
but what you should do with your life,

358
00:16:59,370 --> 00:17:00,260
right time,
right?

359
00:17:00,261 --> 00:17:02,000
It's,
it's actually totalitarian,

360
00:17:02,270 --> 00:17:03,103
which is why that crew,
the people who followed the Frankfurt 

361
00:17:05,871 --> 00:17:10,340
school in the fifties and sixties,
the left wing movements that they became

362
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:12,490
very attracted to during the time.
Uh,

363
00:17:12,710 --> 00:17:17,710
we're mallism with third world communism
because that's what Maoism looked like.

364
00:17:17,810 --> 00:17:18,643
It was this idea that we must rid 
ourselves of our bad ideas before the 

365
00:17:22,791 --> 00:17:24,470
revolution can happen.
It's,

366
00:17:24,730 --> 00:17:28,310
it's fundamentally totalitarian.
It's about the total person.

367
00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:29,400
Yeah.
Alright,

368
00:17:29,430 --> 00:17:31,680
so let's back up.
Let's back up a couple of things.

369
00:17:31,681 --> 00:17:33,120
I think you're going to be bouncing 
around a lot here,

370
00:17:33,420 --> 00:17:34,253
so I love this concept of what you said 
that trump was the first one to reject 

371
00:17:36,991 --> 00:17:40,950
this because during the election I think
a lot of people noticed and I think what

372
00:17:40,951 --> 00:17:44,060
people partly didn't like about Hillary 
was the,

373
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:45,870
you know,
she's on stage with Katy Perry.

374
00:17:45,871 --> 00:17:48,060
Then Madonna is doing a thing the day 
before,

375
00:17:48,210 --> 00:17:50,640
like just this absolute connection

376
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:54,510
between pop culture and politics that 
started feeling gross.

377
00:17:54,511 --> 00:17:55,344
It started feeling like the powers that 
be between entertainment and politics 

378
00:18:00,060 --> 00:18:00,893
were so in bed together.
They all hated trump and I think that 

379
00:18:03,780 --> 00:18:04,613
then boosted his support.
Do you think that's a fair estimate and 

380
00:18:08,790 --> 00:18:11,910
do you think that was a calculated move 
by him or was it just he had been pinned

381
00:18:11,911 --> 00:18:12,744
into a corner because nobody,
none of those people would back in 

382
00:18:14,221 --> 00:18:16,560
except for a few of the deplorable 
rejects.

383
00:18:16,561 --> 00:18:18,920
Like Ted nugent and Scott,
I mean,

384
00:18:18,930 --> 00:18:21,840
I guess I don't have the same critique 
of that that you do.

385
00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:23,390
I have no problem with what you said,
but it just.

386
00:18:23,450 --> 00:18:24,283
I take a different line on it.
I mean to me Katy Perry and Madonna 

387
00:18:29,550 --> 00:18:34,170
being front people for Hillary is a 
contradiction because hillary represents

388
00:18:34,171 --> 00:18:38,070
second wave feminism,
which was read Betty for Dan,

389
00:18:38,071 --> 00:18:40,380
if you don't agree with me,
I mean if you don't believe me,

390
00:18:40,890 --> 00:18:45,890
was a rejection of the objectification 
of women in all forms,

391
00:18:46,441 --> 00:18:46,710
right?

392
00:18:46,710 --> 00:18:47,543
So that any showing of skin,
any sexualization of women was bad and 

393
00:18:52,110 --> 00:18:52,943
need to be left behind free.
Dan said in her book the Feminine 

394
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:58,860
Mystique that women should become 
leaders of corporations,

395
00:18:59,010 --> 00:19:01,020
leaders of government,
and that's it,

396
00:19:01,021 --> 00:19:01,854
and she.
She has several chapters in that book 

397
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:04,193
that are rejections of sex in particular
and also she attacks gay men for being 

398
00:19:10,380 --> 00:19:11,213
eternal boys who were obsessed with sex 
and for seducing housewives into being 

399
00:19:14,971 --> 00:19:17,640
obsessed with sex.
This was free dance whole thing.

400
00:19:17,641 --> 00:19:18,474
She thought that women were themselves 
too interested in sex and what they 

401
00:19:21,271 --> 00:19:24,990
should be interested in was work 
puritanism.

402
00:19:25,110 --> 00:19:26,160
Here you are,
right?

403
00:19:26,490 --> 00:19:28,920
And so Hillary Clinton is the apotheosis
of that,

404
00:19:28,921 --> 00:19:29,550
isn't she?
Right.

405
00:19:29,550 --> 00:19:33,420
Because she wears the business suits.
She is ultra rational,

406
00:19:33,450 --> 00:19:36,810
she is ultra disciplined.
She has her husband get sex elsewhere.

407
00:19:36,811 --> 00:19:38,460
If he does,
he does the bad stuff.

408
00:19:38,850 --> 00:19:40,710
Uh,
so she is this,

409
00:19:40,770 --> 00:19:42,420
she's the perfect second wave feminists.

410
00:19:42,660 --> 00:19:47,660
So Katy Perry showing her boobs on stage
and you know,

411
00:19:47,761 --> 00:19:50,070
Madonna having done the same thing 
before.

412
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:51,353
That's a rejection.
That's a contradiction of a second wave 

413
00:19:53,281 --> 00:19:56,520
feminism.
So someone's not understanding something

414
00:19:56,521 --> 00:19:57,354
here.
I think Hillary does use them but 

415
00:19:58,351 --> 00:20:00,600
probably isn't really a big fan of what 
they're doing.

416
00:20:00,670 --> 00:20:02,130
Right.
So you know,

417
00:20:02,210 --> 00:20:04,020
there there's something,
there's a contradiction that it needs to

418
00:20:04,021 --> 00:20:06,270
be resolved.
Do you think though that,

419
00:20:06,271 --> 00:20:07,104
that contradiction,
like I think people see that even even 

420
00:20:09,330 --> 00:20:10,163
if they don't understand the full 
history of it or the full philosophical 

421
00:20:12,631 --> 00:20:13,464
underpinnings,
I think people kind of see that and I 

422
00:20:15,181 --> 00:20:18,420
think that possibly did drive more 
people to trump.

423
00:20:18,421 --> 00:20:20,580
Do you think that makes sense?
Um,

424
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:21,730
I don't know.
I mean,

425
00:20:21,731 --> 00:20:25,490
if it was a rejection of all of it,
it was just a rejection of just this,

426
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:27,030
this monstrosity.
I.

427
00:20:27,031 --> 00:20:28,980
Oh yeah.
I think that a lot of people,

428
00:20:29,310 --> 00:20:30,570
again,
I don't know,

429
00:20:30,860 --> 00:20:31,260
and people.

430
00:20:31,260 --> 00:20:32,093
I hate the way that people sort of 
presumed to know what trump voters 

431
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:36,690
thought.
You better know everything otherwise,

432
00:20:36,691 --> 00:20:38,040
what the hell are we doing?
My name is Thaddeus.

433
00:20:38,041 --> 00:20:40,460
I better know they,
you know,

434
00:20:40,470 --> 00:20:42,960
but I do think it's reasonable to assume
how's that,

435
00:20:43,210 --> 00:20:44,043
um,
that a lot of them were rejecting or 

436
00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:48,153
reacting to this repressive puritanism 
in Clinton and politics generally that 

437
00:20:53,230 --> 00:20:55,480
and which is not just cultural.
It's not just about sex,

438
00:20:55,481 --> 00:20:56,314
it's that you're not allowed to say all 
kinds of things if you're an American 

439
00:20:59,201 --> 00:20:59,921
politics.
Right.

440
00:20:59,921 --> 00:21:03,700
It's is very restricted discourse that's
allowed in American politics.

441
00:21:03,701 --> 00:21:05,920
I'm sure that was a lot of what went on.
In fact,

442
00:21:05,921 --> 00:21:08,980
I did hear a lot of people say that 
trump says what he thinks.

443
00:21:09,070 --> 00:21:09,903
Yeah.
Just that was very attractive to a lot 

444
00:21:11,501 --> 00:21:16,501
of people and that was attractive to me.
I didn't like most of what he said,

445
00:21:16,870 --> 00:21:20,080
but I did like that he was breaking down
the walls.

446
00:21:20,110 --> 00:21:22,660
Right.
And Bernie to some extent was doing that

447
00:21:22,661 --> 00:21:23,560
too,
you know,

448
00:21:23,580 --> 00:21:24,413
and so I thought that was very good even
though I didn't like either one of them 

449
00:21:26,351 --> 00:21:27,184
in terms of their content,
but I did like that they were simply 

450
00:21:29,261 --> 00:21:32,770
challenging the walls.
Do you think that right there is sort of

451
00:21:32,771 --> 00:21:35,020
what the next evolution of politics is 
going to be?

452
00:21:35,021 --> 00:21:35,854
Because I've been saying for awhile now,
I feel like the chess board has just 

453
00:21:37,841 --> 00:21:40,270
been thrown up.
We've got fertile ground now.

454
00:21:40,390 --> 00:21:41,800
We don't know what's going to grow with 
it.

455
00:21:41,801 --> 00:21:42,650
I think there's,
you know,

456
00:21:42,700 --> 00:21:46,870
the traditional labels of left,
right are becoming meaningless.

457
00:21:46,871 --> 00:21:49,540
What really is a Republican in the age 
of trump,

458
00:21:49,570 --> 00:21:52,090
which is sort of a different thing than 
conservatism,

459
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:53,073
all of that.
Do you think that the next wave of 

460
00:21:54,221 --> 00:21:56,980
politics is really going to be about the
realignment?

461
00:21:57,520 --> 00:21:58,360
I hope this stuff.

462
00:21:58,570 --> 00:21:59,600
I hope so.
Um,

463
00:21:59,710 --> 00:22:00,543
I do.
I know,

464
00:22:00,550 --> 00:22:03,010
I know you've been talking about this a 
lot on your show.

465
00:22:03,011 --> 00:22:03,844
You know,
this,

466
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:09,240
this split between authoritarianism and 
whatever you want to call it,

467
00:22:10,330 --> 00:22:13,360
libertarianism,
small l broadly conceived,

468
00:22:13,410 --> 00:22:15,730
right?
That's what I hope.

469
00:22:15,731 --> 00:22:16,564
Do we need a better word for that?
Because I think because I do believe 

470
00:22:18,011 --> 00:22:18,844
that's what it is.
That is authoritarianism verse 

471
00:22:19,841 --> 00:22:22,500
libertarianism.
But I think when you say libertarianism,

472
00:22:22,510 --> 00:22:23,343
people think of it as some sort of 
offshoot strange political parties 

473
00:22:26,020 --> 00:22:27,530
there.
Is there a better phrase than mean?

474
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:28,473
So for instance,
I have many differences with 

475
00:22:29,861 --> 00:22:30,694
libertarian,
so people often lumped me in with them 

476
00:22:32,231 --> 00:22:33,730
and,
but ask a libertarian,

477
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:34,593
I mean that's like a hardcore 
libertarian about fatty as Russell 

478
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:36,340
that's like,
oh,

479
00:22:36,340 --> 00:22:39,130
he's not a libertarian.
I have many differences with them.

480
00:22:39,131 --> 00:22:40,630
Although in some things I very much 
agree,

481
00:22:40,690 --> 00:22:42,520
but they're,
they,

482
00:22:42,580 --> 00:22:44,500
they're,
um,

483
00:22:44,950 --> 00:22:48,640
hostility to or opposition to the state 
and state power.

484
00:22:48,770 --> 00:22:50,530
Uh,
I'm completely with them on that.

485
00:22:50,531 --> 00:22:55,510
I think markets are very responsive to 
consumers needs and I think they advance

486
00:22:55,810 --> 00:22:57,340
humanity in many,
many ways.

487
00:22:57,341 --> 00:22:58,174
I don't think they're perfect.
I'm think capitalism is perfect and 

488
00:22:59,651 --> 00:23:01,900
that's one of their problems.
But anyway,

489
00:23:01,901 --> 00:23:02,734
I do think that general idea,
that basic idea that we should be free 

490
00:23:06,101 --> 00:23:09,100
from control by others,
those in authority in particular,

491
00:23:09,101 --> 00:23:12,040
those with state power,
which is the monopoly on violence,

492
00:23:12,100 --> 00:23:13,550
right,
um,

493
00:23:13,630 --> 00:23:14,650
is a good thing.
So I,

494
00:23:14,740 --> 00:23:15,573
I,
I love that about them and I love that 

495
00:23:17,021 --> 00:23:17,854
about this sort of new formation I see 
happening and you're a part of that and 

496
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:21,333
some of your guests are part of that 
versus Democrats and Republicans who do 

497
00:23:25,270 --> 00:23:26,103
wants to control us.
Liberals and conservatives who do want 

498
00:23:28,631 --> 00:23:29,464
to control us in various ways.
I would like to see a new realignment 

499
00:23:32,740 --> 00:23:33,573
around that.
I would like to see us talk about 

500
00:23:34,571 --> 00:23:36,430
politics in those terms because of right
and left.

501
00:23:36,431 --> 00:23:37,264
I think you're right.
No longer make make much sense unless 

502
00:23:38,351 --> 00:23:40,120
you're very specific about what you mean
by them.

503
00:23:40,570 --> 00:23:42,970
So we've talked a little bit more about 
the left so far and you know,

504
00:23:42,971 --> 00:23:45,190
my feelings.
I'm trying as as a liberal,

505
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:46,190
I'm trying to clean up

506
00:23:46,550 --> 00:23:48,800
what the left is and I,
at this point,

507
00:23:48,801 --> 00:23:52,490
I don't think that being a liberal and 
being on the left or even compatible,

508
00:23:52,491 --> 00:23:53,324
unfortunately.
But let's talk about the right a little 

509
00:23:54,471 --> 00:23:54,981
bit,
right?

510
00:23:54,981 --> 00:23:57,470
What is right?
Authoritarianism right now,

511
00:23:57,750 --> 00:23:59,680
right wing authoritarianism is sort of 
what we know.

512
00:23:59,681 --> 00:24:02,820
I mean it's using the state to control 
people's personal lives,

513
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:08,130
so they don't want women to choose to be
able to choose abortions.

514
00:24:08,131 --> 00:24:08,964
They don't want us to actually.
They're very concerned about popular 

515
00:24:11,941 --> 00:24:12,774
culture,
so they want to control what we watch 

516
00:24:13,931 --> 00:24:17,100
and listen to know they don't like a lot
of Hollywood.

517
00:24:17,101 --> 00:24:19,740
They don't like a lot of what happens in
the music industry.

518
00:24:20,430 --> 00:24:21,263
They've held marches and protests and 
called for laws to censor those things 

519
00:24:24,340 --> 00:24:25,173
and they also want to control what 
happens in the rest of the world in 

520
00:24:27,331 --> 00:24:28,164
various ways.
They want to send out the United States 

521
00:24:29,311 --> 00:24:31,950
Army to control how people think and 
behave.

522
00:24:31,951 --> 00:24:33,810
Now,
the thing is that lately,

523
00:24:33,900 --> 00:24:34,960
and I think again,
this is where,

524
00:24:35,020 --> 00:24:36,360
where you've been going a lot with your 
show,

525
00:24:36,361 --> 00:24:39,960
is that there's been a convergence 
between the conservatives,

526
00:24:39,990 --> 00:24:41,520
the Republicans,
and the Liberals,

527
00:24:41,521 --> 00:24:43,650
the Democrats on many of these 
questions.

528
00:24:43,651 --> 00:24:45,810
So for instance,
hip hop,

529
00:24:45,900 --> 00:24:47,310
here we go.
Popular Culture,

530
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:51,780
if you look at the reaction to hip hop 
over the last 20 years,

531
00:24:51,781 --> 00:24:53,950
the negative reactions to the calls to 
censor it,

532
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:55,233
it was tipper Gore,
it was a lot of feminists and it was 

533
00:24:58,770 --> 00:25:00,990
Christian conservatives joining 
together.

534
00:25:01,020 --> 00:25:04,140
Al Sharpton was another one who held 
marches against hip hop,

535
00:25:04,141 --> 00:25:07,290
you know,
calling for music companies to shut down

536
00:25:07,291 --> 00:25:09,240
these,
these artists and center the lyrics.

537
00:25:09,241 --> 00:25:11,700
So there's a lot of convergence around 
this.

538
00:25:11,701 --> 00:25:12,630
Authoritarianism.

539
00:25:12,910 --> 00:25:16,000
Yeah.
So where does trump fit into that?

540
00:25:16,570 --> 00:25:17,403
Because he doesn't care about video game
violence or words that are in rap songs 

541
00:25:21,791 --> 00:25:22,624
or even abortion,
I don't think he particularly cares 

542
00:25:24,641 --> 00:25:26,170
about.
Certainly not about gay marriage.

543
00:25:26,290 --> 00:25:28,000
So those things that are thought of as 
right,

544
00:25:28,001 --> 00:25:28,834
authoritarianism,
all these people that are marching with 

545
00:25:30,701 --> 00:25:31,534
Hashtag resist or are they sort of 
missing the boat on who they should be 

546
00:25:34,541 --> 00:25:35,090
attacking?
Right.

547
00:25:35,090 --> 00:25:39,350
It would have been a great thing if he 
had had more than two or three people in

548
00:25:39,351 --> 00:25:42,610
the world who agreed with him.
We're in Washington DC on these things,

549
00:25:42,620 --> 00:25:45,110
right?
So unfortunately he brought just as tiny

550
00:25:45,111 --> 00:25:47,960
little crew to Washington and had to 
fill all these posts,

551
00:25:47,961 --> 00:25:48,794
you know,
all these jobs and the only people 

552
00:25:50,151 --> 00:25:50,984
available.
Unfortunately we're Christian 

553
00:25:52,581 --> 00:25:54,380
conservatives and generals.
Right.

554
00:25:54,381 --> 00:25:56,570
And so what we have is,
and Mike Pence,

555
00:25:56,571 --> 00:25:57,404
right?
So Mike Pence comes from the Christian 

556
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:02,350
conservatives conservative wing and 
they've gotten their,

557
00:26:02,610 --> 00:26:04,370
you know,
their hold on him sessions.

558
00:26:04,371 --> 00:26:05,450
I think there's another one,
right?

559
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:09,560
The who actually thinks that marijuana 
is dangerous to people.

560
00:26:09,561 --> 00:26:10,020
I mean,
it's,

561
00:26:10,020 --> 00:26:10,853
it's phenomenal.
The guy is an absolute neanderthal and 

562
00:26:12,801 --> 00:26:13,634
this stuff,
I do think that he's not going to be 

563
00:26:15,621 --> 00:26:19,370
successful because I think that that war
has been won by us,

564
00:26:19,430 --> 00:26:20,091
you know?
But,

565
00:26:20,091 --> 00:26:21,620
um,
but it's,

566
00:26:21,621 --> 00:26:23,720
it's,
it's unfortunate that trump,

567
00:26:23,810 --> 00:26:24,643
I think he feels beholden to them.
He can't hold any power without the 

568
00:26:27,621 --> 00:26:31,640
Christian conservative base.
And so he's not being really forceful in

569
00:26:31,641 --> 00:26:35,420
his championing of popular culture,
which he comes right out of it.

570
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:35,921
Right.
You know,

571
00:26:35,921 --> 00:26:37,100
I mean,
look at who he is,

572
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:39,340
he's the,
he's the zenith of it.

573
00:26:39,750 --> 00:26:40,080
Wife

574
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:41,880
is a model and you know,
all the rest of it.

575
00:26:41,881 --> 00:26:42,620
I mean,
that's.

576
00:26:42,620 --> 00:26:43,590
So,
yeah.

577
00:26:43,591 --> 00:26:44,424
So trump,
and that's one of the reasons I think 

578
00:26:45,391 --> 00:26:47,490
that he makes people crazy.
In fact,

579
00:26:47,491 --> 00:26:50,310
I actually think that's the main reason 
he makes both sides.

580
00:26:50,311 --> 00:26:53,100
Liberals and conservatives absolutely 
lose their stuff,

581
00:26:53,130 --> 00:26:56,790
which is that p is that he breaks those 
rules.

582
00:26:56,791 --> 00:26:58,440
Cultural rules.
So if you look at,

583
00:26:58,441 --> 00:27:00,600
if you look at puritanism,
right,

584
00:27:00,660 --> 00:27:03,000
what I was talking about,
the work ethic,

585
00:27:03,390 --> 00:27:06,540
what does Donald Trump do?
He got a bunch of money from his dad and

586
00:27:06,541 --> 00:27:09,030
he kind of lives large on his private 
jets.

587
00:27:09,031 --> 00:27:10,070
Everything is in,
you know,

588
00:27:10,110 --> 00:27:10,943
everything is covered in gold and what,
who does that other than Donald Trump 

589
00:27:14,100 --> 00:27:15,960
rappers,
you think about this,

590
00:27:15,961 --> 00:27:18,390
right?
He does a lot of the stuff that,

591
00:27:18,391 --> 00:27:20,160
you know,
the bad black people have done.

592
00:27:20,161 --> 00:27:22,950
They celebrate their bodies and they 
don't care about,

593
00:27:22,951 --> 00:27:23,784
you know,
conventional rules and norms and 

594
00:27:25,441 --> 00:27:26,850
bourgeois morality and all that stuff.

595
00:27:26,850 --> 00:27:28,170
And um,
you know,

596
00:27:28,171 --> 00:27:30,570
he's,
he's not shy about talking about sex.

597
00:27:30,571 --> 00:27:33,120
That's also something you can't do.
That's an absolute taboo.

598
00:27:33,121 --> 00:27:33,954
He breaks all those cultural rules.
I actually think that's why they go 

599
00:27:36,931 --> 00:27:40,620
crazy about Donald Trump in a bad way 
because basically they don't know how to

600
00:27:40,621 --> 00:27:43,500
fight it because they are constrained by
sort of other rules.

601
00:27:43,510 --> 00:27:44,343
Right?
It's so fundamental to who they are and 

602
00:27:46,350 --> 00:27:49,500
what their world is.
When we walk around in America,

603
00:27:49,560 --> 00:27:53,070
generally speaking,
we don't talk about sex.

604
00:27:53,430 --> 00:27:54,263
We just don't.
It's the silence that we impose on 

605
00:27:56,131 --> 00:27:59,640
ourselves.
We all are proud of when we work hard,

606
00:27:59,641 --> 00:28:01,390
even if we don't make a nickel for it.
Right.

607
00:28:01,860 --> 00:28:04,530
It is so central to who we are.
We've internalized it.

608
00:28:04,531 --> 00:28:06,030
It's not like people walk around saying,
Oh,

609
00:28:06,031 --> 00:28:07,800
I'm a puritan,
and here's what the weirdest thing.

610
00:28:08,310 --> 00:28:09,143
It's just.
It's completely deeply embedded inside 

611
00:28:10,351 --> 00:28:10,740
of us.

612
00:28:10,740 --> 00:28:11,573
Since the puritans got here and that's 
what trump just seems to not seem to be 

613
00:28:15,541 --> 00:28:16,374
oblivious to.
Sort of that fundamental American 

614
00:28:18,661 --> 00:28:21,150
culture and I would say it's really a 
middle class culture,

615
00:28:21,210 --> 00:28:22,043
so working class people of all colors 
have generally speaking and immigrants 

616
00:28:26,251 --> 00:28:30,450
to have kind of avoided that stuff.
They haven't internalized it,

617
00:28:30,451 --> 00:28:31,284
of course,
because they're sort of outside of the 

618
00:28:33,220 --> 00:28:35,460
realm of power and they're outside of 
citizenship.

619
00:28:35,490 --> 00:28:37,440
Right.
And so for whatever reason,

620
00:28:37,441 --> 00:28:40,200
I don't know why trump is much more like
them,

621
00:28:40,201 --> 00:28:41,034
even though he's always been a rich kid.
He sort of adopted that kind of working 

622
00:28:43,951 --> 00:28:48,780
class indifference to Bush morality and 
it people can't stand that.

623
00:28:49,110 --> 00:28:49,943
What does that tell you about politics?
Sort of between the ideas and just the 

624
00:28:54,980 --> 00:28:56,600
cult of personality?
Yeah.

625
00:28:56,940 --> 00:28:58,650
Someone that you obviously care about,
ideas,

626
00:28:58,651 --> 00:28:59,870
you have a command of the ideas.

627
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:00,713
You were born out of certain ideas that 
you later challenge and sort of 

628
00:29:03,241 --> 00:29:04,074
incorporated into what you do now,
but basically everything you said is 

629
00:29:06,670 --> 00:29:09,150
this is just cultive personality of what
he's doing.

630
00:29:09,740 --> 00:29:12,450
There's a fundamental,
very depressing problem that I'm sort of

631
00:29:12,451 --> 00:29:15,600
just coming to grips with or coming to 
terms with now in my own life,

632
00:29:15,630 --> 00:29:17,700
which is that,
and that's sort of known this all along,

633
00:29:17,701 --> 00:29:21,120
but it's really hitting me hard,
is that even with the Internet,

634
00:29:21,180 --> 00:29:24,000
even though I think people are better 
informed now than ever before,

635
00:29:24,001 --> 00:29:26,340
because of that,
the vast,

636
00:29:26,341 --> 00:29:27,174
vast,
vast majority of Americans don't know 

637
00:29:28,951 --> 00:29:29,784
anything about politics.
So that's just even spending time on 

638
00:29:32,731 --> 00:29:33,564
twitter.
This is a problem no matter what your 

639
00:29:35,071 --> 00:29:39,240
politics are as a public political 
person or a public intellectual,

640
00:29:39,241 --> 00:29:40,890
you know,
people don't even like that word.

641
00:29:41,110 --> 00:29:42,310
Right?
And it,

642
00:29:42,311 --> 00:29:43,144
all it means is you're a lover of ideas 
that you're curious about big ideas and 

643
00:29:46,031 --> 00:29:46,840
you talk about ideas.

644
00:29:46,840 --> 00:29:47,673
That's it.
You know,

645
00:29:47,680 --> 00:29:51,540
people don't even like it when you use 
that smug son of.

646
00:29:51,700 --> 00:29:56,230
I know I'd smug as the word had been 
called recently more than once.

647
00:29:56,980 --> 00:29:58,600
It's a,
it's a problem.

648
00:29:58,690 --> 00:30:00,160
I mean,
for what we do,

649
00:30:00,220 --> 00:30:00,841
right.
It's,

650
00:30:00,841 --> 00:30:01,674
you know,
so that's why we have those of us in 

651
00:30:03,851 --> 00:30:05,980
this little world talk to each other 
most of the time.

652
00:30:05,981 --> 00:30:06,840
Yeah,
right,

653
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:09,760
because most Americans have never heard 
of Syria,

654
00:30:10,510 --> 00:30:12,460
much less know anything about it.
You know,

655
00:30:12,850 --> 00:30:14,600
most Americans.
I mean,

656
00:30:14,680 --> 00:30:15,513
look at the polls.
It's just most Americans I think don't 

657
00:30:17,261 --> 00:30:19,030
know who the vice president is.
It's something like that.

658
00:30:19,031 --> 00:30:21,790
I mean they can't identify Washington dc
on a map,

659
00:30:22,230 --> 00:30:23,063
you know,
huge portions of the American public 

660
00:30:24,491 --> 00:30:26,110
don't know anything.
Is,

661
00:30:26,130 --> 00:30:26,963
is that just a function of our success 
that we are perhaps the most successful 

662
00:30:32,471 --> 00:30:34,510
nation in the history of the world?

663
00:30:34,950 --> 00:30:37,180
Uh,
we have done tremendous amounts of good.

664
00:30:37,181 --> 00:30:39,190
We've done plenty of bad at the same 
time.

665
00:30:39,191 --> 00:30:42,130
We brought in more people from every 
walk of life.

666
00:30:42,131 --> 00:30:45,640
All of these things.
We've created this system that basically

667
00:30:45,641 --> 00:30:50,641
still is pretty great at what you get 
out of that after the sausage is you get

668
00:30:51,581 --> 00:30:52,414
sort of dumb down thing because people 
have video games and have leisure and 

669
00:30:57,371 --> 00:30:58,830
sports and all of those things.
Yeah.

670
00:30:58,831 --> 00:31:00,530
So I think those are good things.
I mean,

671
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:04,630
I think it's pretty great and that 
doesn't mean there aren't problems and I

672
00:31:04,631 --> 00:31:07,060
wish more people cared about ideas and 
all that,

673
00:31:07,300 --> 00:31:10,660
but that it's just the function of 
success is some of this.

674
00:31:10,710 --> 00:31:12,640
Yeah,
you don't need to care about stuff.

675
00:31:12,641 --> 00:31:14,680
You don't need to think,
you don't need to read Co.

676
00:31:15,930 --> 00:31:17,650
You can start all you want about what he
thinks,

677
00:31:17,651 --> 00:31:19,690
but you don't need to read them because 
no one does.

678
00:31:19,690 --> 00:31:21,360
So there's no one ever checks You on it.
Right?

679
00:31:21,410 --> 00:31:22,800
Um,
but that,

680
00:31:24,370 --> 00:31:26,050
so yeah,
I mean,

681
00:31:26,051 --> 00:31:28,210
I,
it's like I often say to people like you

682
00:31:28,211 --> 00:31:29,044
and me,
it's like,

683
00:31:29,380 --> 00:31:30,213
are we sure we want to be doing this 
when we have a better time in a better 

684
00:31:32,651 --> 00:31:33,484
life?
If we were just following sports 

685
00:31:34,931 --> 00:31:36,340
instead.
I love sports.

686
00:31:36,520 --> 00:31:38,890
It's funny,
I had jason whitlock from fox sports one

687
00:31:38,891 --> 00:31:42,440
on a couple of weeks ago and he was so 
clearly passionate noses,

688
00:31:42,520 --> 00:31:45,400
thoughts and all that stuff about 
politics and the wider world.

689
00:31:45,670 --> 00:31:46,810
And then when he left I was like,
man,

690
00:31:46,811 --> 00:31:48,570
that guy gets to talk about sports or 
anything.

691
00:31:48,571 --> 00:31:49,404
I was like,
that would be pretty great if I was an 

692
00:31:50,531 --> 00:31:52,870
nba analysts,
but we do love this.

693
00:31:52,871 --> 00:31:53,860
That's the,
that's the,

694
00:31:53,950 --> 00:31:54,850
I don't know.
I mean,

695
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:57,100
aren't we can flip flop.
I love it.

696
00:31:57,160 --> 00:31:58,690
Well you do,
but you're also fortunate by it.

697
00:31:58,870 --> 00:31:59,800
Yeah,
it's exhausting.

698
00:31:59,801 --> 00:32:00,430
when,
when,

699
00:32:00,430 --> 00:32:04,840
when articles and publications call me 
an outright extremist or you know,

700
00:32:04,841 --> 00:32:05,674
and then I have to go,
well now do I want to spend my day 

701
00:32:06,581 --> 00:32:08,950
fighting this or just letting it be or.
But it all,

702
00:32:08,951 --> 00:32:10,330
it's fighting.
That's what it is.

703
00:32:10,360 --> 00:32:11,193
Right.
And so half the time I love the fight 

704
00:32:12,101 --> 00:32:13,960
and half the time I hate it.
I don't know what else to say.

705
00:32:13,961 --> 00:32:15,490
I mean,
I don't know what else I could do.

706
00:32:15,550 --> 00:32:16,383
I mean,
I would love to be like a boxing coach 

707
00:32:17,681 --> 00:32:19,450
instead,
but I don't think I can.

708
00:32:19,451 --> 00:32:21,790
And um,
I'd like to be in the nba,

709
00:32:21,810 --> 00:32:23,060
right?
Probably not.

710
00:32:23,320 --> 00:32:24,740
So you know,
you know,

711
00:32:24,790 --> 00:32:28,150
jews used to dominate basketball.
I know in this country.

712
00:32:28,180 --> 00:32:28,820
Oh,
you do know this.

713
00:32:28,820 --> 00:32:29,653
I know,
I know.

714
00:32:30,070 --> 00:32:32,240
There were a lot of jews in the early 
days of the mba.

715
00:32:32,270 --> 00:32:33,103
Now it's dominated.
It's too late for dominated 40 with a 

716
00:32:35,441 --> 00:32:36,880
badge,
so you could bring that back.

717
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:37,793
You know.
Now that I think there are no jews and 

718
00:32:38,441 --> 00:32:40,760
the mta.
You can be the first and not one jew.

719
00:32:40,761 --> 00:32:41,594
That's pretty sad.
I've heard that Jordan farmar is half 

720
00:32:43,011 --> 00:32:44,910
jewish.
That's about it.

721
00:32:45,690 --> 00:32:47,240
They got them out.
They found out.

722
00:32:48,210 --> 00:32:51,010
I think they actually sent it to Israel,
but total sidebar,

723
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:52,660
but wait,
I want to focus a little more on that,

724
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:53,553
on that right authority thing because it
isn't the part of the authoritarian 

725
00:32:57,251 --> 00:32:58,084
stuff that I focus on a lot,
so I do want to spend a little more 

726
00:33:00,371 --> 00:33:01,204
time.
They a part of it doesn't make sense to 

727
00:33:02,711 --> 00:33:03,544
me.
Like it Seems to me that on something 

728
00:33:04,091 --> 00:33:08,680
like gay marriage,
if the right that supposedly believes in

729
00:33:08,681 --> 00:33:13,320
states rights and in the individual and 
in local limited government,

730
00:33:13,330 --> 00:33:14,163
all of those things,
they had such an easy opportunity to do 

731
00:33:16,571 --> 00:33:18,940
the right thing with gay marriage.
Now,

732
00:33:18,941 --> 00:33:21,640
of course it got screwed up because of 
the christian conservatives,

733
00:33:21,850 --> 00:33:22,683
but even right now with marijuana,
as you're talking about with jeff 

734
00:33:24,281 --> 00:33:26,770
sessions,
it's like you guys are the ones that are

735
00:33:26,771 --> 00:33:31,771
supposed to care about limited 
government and not having the government

736
00:33:32,081 --> 00:33:33,640
tell people what they can do in their 
own home.

737
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,790
Why are they unable to take a principled
position here?

738
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:37,740
Um,
it.

739
00:33:37,740 --> 00:33:38,970
Well,
I don't know about being.

740
00:33:39,030 --> 00:33:39,631
Okay.
Well,

741
00:33:39,631 --> 00:33:41,910
I think for me,
and did I lead too much?

742
00:33:42,010 --> 00:33:42,211
No,
no,

743
00:33:42,211 --> 00:33:42,721
no,
no.

744
00:33:42,721 --> 00:33:43,554
I think that conservative or republican 
authoritarianism is different in a very 

745
00:33:48,031 --> 00:33:48,864
important way and it's the reason that I
like you focus much more on left 

746
00:33:52,201 --> 00:33:54,960
authoritarianism,
which is that they are dumber.

747
00:33:55,870 --> 00:33:56,703
No,
Really,

748
00:33:57,030 --> 00:33:57,863
they are less effective at getting 
authoritarian politics out there and 

749
00:34:01,651 --> 00:34:05,250
distributed and bought into the 
sessions.

750
00:34:05,251 --> 00:34:06,420
This is what I was saying about 
sessions,

751
00:34:06,421 --> 00:34:07,680
right?
Good lUck buddy.

752
00:34:07,830 --> 00:34:11,520
Like convincing America to roll back 
legalization of pot.

753
00:34:11,640 --> 00:34:12,840
It ain't gonna happen,
right?

754
00:34:13,130 --> 00:34:13,963
Um,
you're certainly not going to convince 

755
00:34:15,241 --> 00:34:16,500
anyone of this stuff.
I mean,

756
00:34:16,501 --> 00:34:17,334
no one,
no one believes other than jeff 

757
00:34:18,421 --> 00:34:19,500
sessions.
Really.

758
00:34:19,560 --> 00:34:22,650
That pot is harmful to you in the way 
that he's talking about.

759
00:34:23,120 --> 00:34:24,140
Um,
but then yeah,

760
00:34:24,160 --> 00:34:24,993
what does that say that,
that even president obama was still 

761
00:34:28,121 --> 00:34:31,940
having the feds shut down the local 
things like here in college.

762
00:34:32,160 --> 00:34:34,260
That is my point.
That is exactly what I'm saying here.

763
00:34:34,261 --> 00:34:35,094
So the sessions won't be able to do it.
Obama could because everybody loved 

764
00:34:38,581 --> 00:34:39,414
obama because obama played by all the 
rules because he was the perfect 

765
00:34:42,151 --> 00:34:46,980
american man and he was black and so he,
he kInd of fixed our are bad history for

766
00:34:46,981 --> 00:34:48,450
us too.
He made us feel better.

767
00:34:48,451 --> 00:34:49,890
He was our salvation.
He was,

768
00:34:49,950 --> 00:34:52,050
he was perfect.
He was almost a jesus fIgure.

769
00:34:52,470 --> 00:34:55,170
And that's real and I mean that people 
really did treat him that way.

770
00:34:55,171 --> 00:34:57,930
And I don't think that's an exaggeration
if you look at it right.

771
00:34:58,610 --> 00:34:59,443
And so he could send in the feds to shut
down marijuana dispensaries and no one 

772
00:35:03,871 --> 00:35:06,570
batted an eye certainly on the left.
But why did he.

773
00:35:06,780 --> 00:35:07,470
Oh,
why did.

774
00:35:07,470 --> 00:35:09,530
Yeah,
I see what you're saying on the one that

775
00:35:09,531 --> 00:35:11,940
he can get away with it.
But why do you think he did?

776
00:35:11,941 --> 00:35:14,580
If most likely he doesn't really care 
about

777
00:35:15,140 --> 00:35:16,630
marIjuana laws,
do you think?

778
00:35:16,730 --> 00:35:17,870
I don't know.
I,

779
00:35:17,871 --> 00:35:20,060
I would say that he,
like,

780
00:35:20,210 --> 00:35:21,043
like people in the progressive left and 
I include liberals in this are 

781
00:35:25,611 --> 00:35:28,910
interested primarily in social control,
so they need.

782
00:35:28,911 --> 00:35:29,790
And that's not,
it doesn't,

783
00:35:29,970 --> 00:35:32,690
that's not saying that they're evil,
that's just who they are.

784
00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:36,380
They like a well ordered society,
so I don't know,

785
00:35:36,410 --> 00:35:39,810
but I would suspect and look at obama,
he's like the paragon of discipline,

786
00:35:39,811 --> 00:35:40,644
right?
He is actually the perfect pure attend 

787
00:35:41,371 --> 00:35:43,070
at least as far as we know.
Right.

788
00:35:43,610 --> 00:35:44,443
Um,
I would say that part of it that he 

789
00:35:45,961 --> 00:35:46,794
didn't like the fact that people were 
violating federal law and I think 

790
00:35:49,711 --> 00:35:52,050
getting high,
I think he now sees as,

791
00:35:52,120 --> 00:35:53,610
as disruptive,
right?

792
00:35:53,611 --> 00:35:55,010
It's not a good thing.
Um,

793
00:35:55,740 --> 00:35:58,050
so look at his sermons.
Here you go.

794
00:35:58,140 --> 00:36:00,690
Sermons or lectures or speeches,
whatever you want to call them.

795
00:36:00,840 --> 00:36:04,020
Interesting choice against black 
culture,

796
00:36:04,200 --> 00:36:06,360
which people sort of don't pay attention
to,

797
00:36:06,361 --> 00:36:07,194
but he gave many.
every time the guy got in front of a 

798
00:36:08,791 --> 00:36:09,624
black audience,
he would start lecturing them about 

799
00:36:12,031 --> 00:36:12,864
watching too much espn and about how 
they needed to pull up their pants and 

800
00:36:15,631 --> 00:36:18,330
how much,
how they needed to work harder and raise

801
00:36:18,331 --> 00:36:19,141
their children.
Right.

802
00:36:19,141 --> 00:36:20,610
And stop eating.
Popeye's chicken,

803
00:36:20,760 --> 00:36:22,860
google it.
I mean he went and michelle did the same

804
00:36:22,861 --> 00:36:26,220
thing,
this really stern admonitions of,

805
00:36:26,250 --> 00:36:30,090
of black culture.
So I think that's all of the piece.

806
00:36:30,091 --> 00:36:34,830
I think that's probably plays into why 
he did go after the dispensary's.

807
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:36,033
Yeah,

808
00:36:36,230 --> 00:36:37,430
got it.
There's a lot there.

809
00:36:37,431 --> 00:36:38,264
So where we started before we went on 
this 20 minutes a roundabout was I was 

810
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:44,320
mentioning the,
you know,

811
00:36:44,370 --> 00:36:45,750
the outcasts,
sort of the,

812
00:36:45,780 --> 00:36:46,613
the drunks and all those people.
And then I said it was sorta like some 

813
00:36:49,971 --> 00:36:50,804
of the people that were in your house 
growing up and you were making a 

814
00:36:52,611 --> 00:36:54,380
distinction that those are not the same 
thing.

815
00:36:54,381 --> 00:36:55,780
So let's,
let's go back to that.

816
00:36:55,781 --> 00:36:56,990
That was good.
I had it there.

817
00:36:56,991 --> 00:36:59,000
I knew we were going to get.
That was very good.

818
00:36:59,850 --> 00:37:00,740
Um,
yeah.

819
00:37:00,950 --> 00:37:01,530
So

820
00:37:01,530 --> 00:37:02,363
the communists in my house growing up 
were puritanical because as I said 

821
00:37:06,481 --> 00:37:07,314
earlier,
you know,

822
00:37:07,500 --> 00:37:09,660
communists and socialists have always 
been puritanical.

823
00:37:09,690 --> 00:37:10,523
Again,
this is lots of literature has been 

824
00:37:11,701 --> 00:37:13,260
written on this.
This is not just me talking.

825
00:37:13,860 --> 00:37:17,340
I'm lennon and marks were po,
sorry,

826
00:37:17,341 --> 00:37:18,174
lenin and trotsky were opposed to 
homosexuality because homosexuality was 

827
00:37:22,501 --> 00:37:25,800
sort of being bad in itself,
but because it was decadent,

828
00:37:26,260 --> 00:37:30,630
so decadence was the problem for 
communists throughout the 20th century.

829
00:37:31,380 --> 00:37:32,213
They thought like adorno did later,
that it was this thing that was leading 

830
00:37:35,761 --> 00:37:37,010
the working class,
the decadence,

831
00:37:37,110 --> 00:37:37,943
popular culture,
consumerism was leading the working 

832
00:37:39,900 --> 00:37:40,733
class astray with the working class 
should be doing instead was organizing 

833
00:37:43,711 --> 00:37:46,440
themselves for revolution.
Now here's what they understood,

834
00:37:46,810 --> 00:37:48,700
and this is why it's all logical.
Uh,

835
00:37:48,750 --> 00:37:53,130
they understood that when you control or
manage a whole society,

836
00:37:53,131 --> 00:37:54,780
which is what they wanted everyone to 
do,

837
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:56,670
that requires tremendous discipline.

838
00:37:56,850 --> 00:37:59,910
You can't be going to the movies if 
you're going to be managing the economy.

839
00:38:00,120 --> 00:38:01,770
Right?
And so that's what they said.

840
00:38:01,771 --> 00:38:03,450
And I mean this was the,
this was their argument.

841
00:38:03,480 --> 00:38:07,140
We need to instill this perfect 
proletarian discipline.

842
00:38:07,141 --> 00:38:10,530
It wasn't the phrase in the soviet union
and elsewhere,

843
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:14,420
and so my parents comrades came out of 
that tradition.

844
00:38:14,421 --> 00:38:15,780
They were trotskyists,
you know,

845
00:38:15,810 --> 00:38:17,460
they came out of that and they 
understood that,

846
00:38:17,490 --> 00:38:21,150
so they may have watched some television
but they didn't.

847
00:38:21,210 --> 00:38:23,490
they thought at best it was just an 
escape.

848
00:38:23,610 --> 00:38:24,443
right.
And what we really need to be doing is 

849
00:38:26,220 --> 00:38:28,650
studying gdp figures,
right?

850
00:38:28,651 --> 00:38:30,270
And so,
so that we can manage the economy.

851
00:38:30,271 --> 00:38:31,104
Everyone should be doIng that.
Everyone should be an engineer and 

852
00:38:33,571 --> 00:38:36,820
everyone should be ready to have 
meetings all day long and all night long

853
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:37,833
to organize our society.
So it's so interesting because I don't 

854
00:38:41,090 --> 00:38:43,270
as you're saying that,
I was thinking that recently.

855
00:38:43,270 --> 00:38:46,990
I've been saying this thing about how 
comedy I think is dying right now too,

856
00:38:47,380 --> 00:38:49,900
that there are in comics willing to 
cross the line.

857
00:38:49,901 --> 00:38:50,734
We've got bill maher apologizing for a 
word even though no one in their right 

858
00:38:53,051 --> 00:38:53,884
mind thinks he's racist.
we've seen so many leftist progressive 

859
00:38:57,490 --> 00:38:58,323
comedians just making the same trump 
jokes over again and not really pushing 

860
00:39:01,691 --> 00:39:05,080
the limits of what comedy is.
But with what you're saying,

861
00:39:05,081 --> 00:39:08,200
it really does make sense why they 
almost can't be funny.

862
00:39:08,260 --> 00:39:12,430
This is what I've been saying,
that these progressives who are shutting

863
00:39:12,431 --> 00:39:16,870
down pop culture in these ways are true 
to their heritage.

864
00:39:17,140 --> 00:39:19,720
This is what progressives,
I mean the progressives,

865
00:39:19,721 --> 00:39:21,430
the original ones that the early 20th 
century.

866
00:39:21,431 --> 00:39:26,260
did they shut down the nickelodeons they
did they in every city in the country.

867
00:39:26,261 --> 00:39:27,094
ProgressIve's launch these campaigns.
Can you just tell people what 

868
00:39:28,691 --> 00:39:29,524
nickelodeon's are?

869
00:39:29,950 --> 00:39:30,783
Because a lot of people.
My younger audience is going to think 

870
00:39:31,991 --> 00:39:34,390
you mean with the green.
But that's not what you mean.

871
00:39:34,450 --> 00:39:35,283
Yeah.
The nickelodeon network is named after 

872
00:39:38,620 --> 00:39:41,650
the cinemas in which started in the 
lower east side of New York,

873
00:39:41,651 --> 00:39:43,900
but grew and spread all over the 
country,

874
00:39:44,170 --> 00:39:47,290
which were a five cent cinemas.
You could go and put a nickel in and you

875
00:39:47,291 --> 00:39:48,230
could watch a movie.
Yeah.

876
00:39:48,300 --> 00:39:49,133
So I'm sure they would probably want to 
go after the green room at some point 

877
00:39:50,681 --> 00:39:51,514
too,
because there's got to be some racial 

878
00:39:52,001 --> 00:39:52,834
connotation to that.
So the progressIve is in all the big 

879
00:39:56,351 --> 00:39:57,184
cities.
Shut down those nickelodeon's because 

880
00:39:57,881 --> 00:40:00,130
the working class was watching 
burlesque,

881
00:40:00,340 --> 00:40:01,270
you know,
or you know,

882
00:40:01,271 --> 00:40:03,160
just or things that weren't about work 
and you know,

883
00:40:03,161 --> 00:40:05,650
discipline and war.
Um,

884
00:40:05,950 --> 00:40:07,120
and so yeah,
it's,

885
00:40:07,330 --> 00:40:08,650
they're being true to their heritage.
Yeah.

886
00:40:08,651 --> 00:40:11,980
We should have culture that is 
completely austere,

887
00:40:12,280 --> 00:40:12,610
right.

888
00:40:12,610 --> 00:40:17,610
And not fun or funny in those ways.
That's why the is so unfunny right?

889
00:40:18,641 --> 00:40:19,361
Think about it.
I mean,

890
00:40:19,361 --> 00:40:20,194
they're so earnest.
They're so earnest that they can't make 

891
00:40:22,631 --> 00:40:23,201
a joke.
Well,

892
00:40:23,201 --> 00:40:24,034
that's the thIng.
They've been birth pepe and tech and 

893
00:40:27,850 --> 00:40:28,683
Pakistan and all.
They birthed it because it's these 

894
00:40:30,340 --> 00:40:33,740
people online that have Just had it with
the political correctness.

895
00:40:33,850 --> 00:40:34,683
So noW they're sending out frogs with 
swastika is just to get a reaction out 

896
00:40:38,381 --> 00:40:40,540
of people and people that think it's 
hate speech.

897
00:40:40,600 --> 00:40:41,433
I had horses,
I had gavin mcinnes on my show and you 

898
00:40:44,040 --> 00:40:44,873
know,
it became very clear to me about five 

899
00:40:45,701 --> 00:40:48,310
minutes in this is what's happening.
He's hilarious.

900
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:53,770
much oF what he says is either racist or
pretty damn close.

901
00:40:54,310 --> 00:40:57,400
And the content of what he's saying,
I have a lot of trouble with.

902
00:40:57,401 --> 00:40:59,830
I don't know how serious he is about it,
but it's,

903
00:40:59,860 --> 00:41:00,693
it's clearly right wing in,
in pretty bad ways according to my 

904
00:41:03,881 --> 00:41:04,714
politics.

905
00:41:04,810 --> 00:41:06,370
But he's really,
really funny.

906
00:41:06,520 --> 00:41:10,570
He has the freedom to do that.
Comedy requires freedom.

907
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:13,330
Jim goad is another one.
You know,

908
00:41:13,360 --> 00:41:15,010
he,
he just approached me.

909
00:41:15,011 --> 00:41:15,844
He wants to be on my podcast and he.
But he and I started looking at his 

910
00:41:17,681 --> 00:41:21,670
writing.
Much of what he says is probably racist.

911
00:41:21,790 --> 00:41:24,220
Probably sexist,
probably homophobic,

912
00:41:24,760 --> 00:41:26,080
but he's hilarious.
He's very,

913
00:41:26,081 --> 00:41:28,300
very funny.
So what do you do?

914
00:41:28,450 --> 00:41:31,510
What I want to ask you that,
what do you do with that?

915
00:41:31,540 --> 00:41:32,373
You personally,
what do you do with that when you're 

916
00:41:33,441 --> 00:41:36,080
sitting across from someone like that?
Right.

917
00:41:36,081 --> 00:41:39,590
I don't know.
I laugh and I'm troubled and I feel like

918
00:41:39,591 --> 00:41:41,670
if they are not.
However I feel like if they,

919
00:41:41,680 --> 00:41:44,780
like with gavin mcinnes,
he has no real power,

920
00:41:45,080 --> 00:41:45,651
right?
I mean,

921
00:41:45,651 --> 00:41:48,410
no one's gonna listen to him and write 
some policy based on this.

922
00:41:49,030 --> 00:41:50,300
Um,
you know,

923
00:41:50,301 --> 00:41:52,370
you could say he contributes to the 
trump phenomenon,

924
00:41:52,371 --> 00:41:54,080
but what's the trump phenomenon?

925
00:41:54,080 --> 00:41:55,820
I mean,
there is no trump phenomenon anymore.

926
00:41:55,821 --> 00:41:57,770
The generals have taken over basically,
you know,

927
00:41:57,800 --> 00:41:59,170
um,
um,

928
00:41:59,240 --> 00:42:00,073
yeah,
once they attach themselves to any 

929
00:42:02,271 --> 00:42:07,271
movement that might seize state power,
oh then give me an ak 47,

930
00:42:07,840 --> 00:42:10,400
but they,
these guys are so marginalized.

931
00:42:10,460 --> 00:42:11,293
People talk about being marginalized,
the marginalized or those guys and what 

932
00:42:14,541 --> 00:42:16,670
they represent.
It's so interesting you say that because

933
00:42:16,671 --> 00:42:20,540
that's the other reason that I focus on 
the left is not just because I come from

934
00:42:20,541 --> 00:42:21,374
it,
but also because I see that's where all 

935
00:42:22,851 --> 00:42:23,684
the power is seated the conversation and
see seated their hollywood is all those 

936
00:42:26,481 --> 00:42:27,830
things.
So when they get,

937
00:42:27,890 --> 00:42:28,570
you know,
the,

938
00:42:28,570 --> 00:42:29,403
the three white supremacists to show up 
at a meeting somewhere and then of 

939
00:42:32,451 --> 00:42:33,284
course the media blows it out of 
proportion as if there's nazis re 

940
00:42:35,840 --> 00:42:39,590
rampaging through the streets.
It's like you just need that,

941
00:42:39,650 --> 00:42:40,970
need,
that belief.

942
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:42,410
Do you think that's a fair?
Oh,

943
00:42:42,411 --> 00:42:43,280
absolutely.
Oh yeah.

944
00:42:43,281 --> 00:42:43,610
No,
no.

945
00:42:43,610 --> 00:42:44,031
Yeah,
I mean,

946
00:42:44,031 --> 00:42:46,850
so they control most of the media.
It's just true.

947
00:42:47,010 --> 00:42:48,770
Okay.
liberals,

948
00:42:48,830 --> 00:42:50,650
liberals mostly.
Not really socialists,

949
00:42:50,660 --> 00:42:51,493
but liberals controlled the media for 
the most part other than fox news and 

950
00:42:54,021 --> 00:42:54,854
fox.
That's.

951
00:42:54,880 --> 00:42:55,713
Well,
by the way,

952
00:42:55,880 --> 00:42:57,560
if you've ever been in the fox news 
green room,

953
00:42:57,561 --> 00:43:00,020
you'll know that there's a lot of 
liberals who even worked there,

954
00:43:00,710 --> 00:43:02,150
the people behind the scenes,
there's tons.

955
00:43:02,151 --> 00:43:05,330
I knew gay people that work there and 
all sorts of New York city,

956
00:43:05,331 --> 00:43:06,810
upper west side.
Exactly.

957
00:43:06,870 --> 00:43:07,703
Um,
and they control academia and they 

958
00:43:10,941 --> 00:43:13,070
control what's now being called the deep
state,

959
00:43:13,100 --> 00:43:13,731
whatever,
you know,

960
00:43:13,731 --> 00:43:16,490
if that's whatever.
But you know,

961
00:43:16,491 --> 00:43:17,324
in terms of the civil servants who work 
in Washington dc and working all the 

962
00:43:20,241 --> 00:43:21,620
state capitals,
it's over.

963
00:43:21,621 --> 00:43:25,040
We know this is overwhelmingly liberal.
So yeah,

964
00:43:25,160 --> 00:43:29,300
this is why I get upset because they 
control the world that I operate in.

965
00:43:29,480 --> 00:43:30,313
They determine my fate in many ways.
So I know that just because of the 

966
00:43:32,871 --> 00:43:34,100
things that we talk about here every 
week,

967
00:43:34,101 --> 00:43:34,934
when you say the word liberal,
that a certain amount of my audience is 

968
00:43:36,651 --> 00:43:37,401
going to go,
wait a minute,

969
00:43:37,401 --> 00:43:38,234
does he mean classical liberal or does 
he mean progressive or leftist or 

970
00:43:42,200 --> 00:43:43,033
something?
You,

971
00:43:43,040 --> 00:43:45,050
it's obvious to me you're making that 
distinction,

972
00:43:45,110 --> 00:43:45,943
but the word liberal has now been so 
muddied that in some ways it's not even 

973
00:43:49,820 --> 00:43:51,860
worth the progressives who,
who,

974
00:43:51,890 --> 00:43:52,723
uh,
shut down the nickelodeons and the turn 

975
00:43:53,901 --> 00:43:56,750
of the 20th century.
They're the ones who changed the meaning

976
00:43:56,751 --> 00:43:57,584
of the word.
They seized it sort of after world war 

977
00:43:59,691 --> 00:44:00,351
one and said,
oh no,

978
00:44:00,351 --> 00:44:01,490
we're liberals.
And people are like,

979
00:44:01,491 --> 00:44:02,710
what are you talking about?
You're not liberals.

980
00:44:02,720 --> 00:44:04,980
You want the state to control much of 
the economy and,

981
00:44:05,150 --> 00:44:07,310
and much of our lives.
And um,

982
00:44:07,311 --> 00:44:07,941
but they,
they,

983
00:44:07,941 --> 00:44:10,040
they started to use that word and it 
stuck.

984
00:44:10,100 --> 00:44:10,933
And so once the,
once the new deal happens in the 19 

985
00:44:12,501 --> 00:44:14,750
thirties,
franklin roosevelt becomes another jesus

986
00:44:14,751 --> 00:44:15,584
fIgure and he calls himself a liberal 
and they people call his movement 

987
00:44:18,261 --> 00:44:20,960
liberal then that was it.
That was the moment,

988
00:44:20,961 --> 00:44:22,820
that turning point.
No,

989
00:44:22,821 --> 00:44:23,780
this is all,
of course,

990
00:44:23,781 --> 00:44:27,590
a repudiation of classical liberalism,
which is about the individual,

991
00:44:27,650 --> 00:44:30,560
you know,
having some autonomy or at least freedom

992
00:44:30,561 --> 00:44:32,670
from the state and its power.

993
00:44:32,760 --> 00:44:37,740
Do you think that people like us can win
that word back?

994
00:44:38,060 --> 00:44:39,320
That's what I've been thinking about 
lately,

995
00:44:39,360 --> 00:44:42,810
like I like making this argument for 
liberalism versus the left.

996
00:44:42,960 --> 00:44:43,793
I just don't think it's a liberal 
movement anymore and I know that I 

997
00:44:46,471 --> 00:44:47,304
brought a lot of people to it and have 
many allies that are doing similar work 

998
00:44:49,790 --> 00:44:51,240
that you included.
Um,

999
00:44:51,960 --> 00:44:52,793
but do you think it's possible,
like the word liberal is now so tainted 

1000
00:44:55,590 --> 00:44:57,300
that in the,
in the broader sense,

1001
00:44:57,390 --> 00:44:59,580
maybe we can build something around that
word.

1002
00:44:59,610 --> 00:45:02,370
Not to say the ideas can't be used in 
another way.

1003
00:45:02,450 --> 00:45:03,890
Yeah.
So I'm not sure I want to.

1004
00:45:03,950 --> 00:45:07,760
So I'm not a classical liberal and I 
don't love classical liberalism.

1005
00:45:07,761 --> 00:45:10,130
I like some of it,
but the,

1006
00:45:10,190 --> 00:45:15,190
the puritan notion of the repressed 
individual who never talks about sex and

1007
00:45:16,031 --> 00:45:18,500
don't only have sex to procreate and he 
works all the time.

1008
00:45:19,010 --> 00:45:21,140
That's actually at the center of 
classical liberalism.

1009
00:45:21,141 --> 00:45:23,900
So if you read john locke and you read 
the founding fathers,

1010
00:45:24,170 --> 00:45:25,003
this is what they say.
We must regulate ourselves so that the 

1011
00:45:29,151 --> 00:45:31,850
state doesn't have to.
So it's a,

1012
00:45:31,851 --> 00:45:35,210
it's a cultural puritanism.
It's good that they don't want the state

1013
00:45:35,211 --> 00:45:37,370
regulating us in those ways,
so I liked that.

1014
00:45:37,371 --> 00:45:41,270
I like the bill of rights,
but they say for that to happen,

1015
00:45:41,360 --> 00:45:42,193
for that to be possible,
we must constantly police ourselves so 

1016
00:45:46,071 --> 00:45:48,230
the cop becomes internal.
The police,

1017
00:45:48,320 --> 00:45:51,080
the policeman is inside of us,
so I don't love that.

1018
00:45:51,110 --> 00:45:51,943
yeah,
yeah,

1019
00:45:51,960 --> 00:45:52,793
yeah.
that's interesting because I've never 

1020
00:45:53,161 --> 00:45:55,680
thought of it in that I know exactly 
what you're talking about,

1021
00:45:55,681 --> 00:45:56,514
but to me that was more of just a sign 
of the times then versus now because 

1022
00:45:59,821 --> 00:46:02,490
aren't we all policing ourselves in our 
own way?

1023
00:46:02,491 --> 00:46:06,180
I mean every day you get up and you 
don't do everything that every whim that

1024
00:46:06,181 --> 00:46:08,340
you want to do and every crazy urge that
you want to do.

1025
00:46:08,460 --> 00:46:11,010
So we're all sort of doIng that just by 
living,

1026
00:46:11,011 --> 00:46:11,300
right?

1027
00:46:11,300 --> 00:46:12,133
Oh yeah,
sure.

1028
00:46:12,190 --> 00:46:14,270
It's not.
I mean it's not.

1029
00:46:14,300 --> 00:46:16,850
It wasn't a sign of the times that they 
made this argument.

1030
00:46:16,851 --> 00:46:17,684
I mean lock and the founding fathers,
the whole first chapter of my book 

1031
00:46:19,790 --> 00:46:20,623
renegade histories on this.
I mean if you think about it's 

1032
00:46:22,461 --> 00:46:23,241
consistent,
right?

1033
00:46:23,241 --> 00:46:25,820
They wanted the people,
or at least some of the people,

1034
00:46:25,850 --> 00:46:27,650
many of the people to control the 
country,

1035
00:46:28,040 --> 00:46:30,170
take it away from the king and run it 
themselves,

1036
00:46:30,171 --> 00:46:31,004
and they understood this thing that the,
that the leninist understood a century 

1037
00:46:34,040 --> 00:46:35,210
later,
which is that,

1038
00:46:35,270 --> 00:46:35,961
oh,
to do that,

1039
00:46:35,961 --> 00:46:37,940
jesus,
we've got to like learn a bunch of stuff

1040
00:46:37,941 --> 00:46:39,240
and we've got to stop,
you know,

1041
00:46:39,290 --> 00:46:41,540
going to the cockfights and stopped 
smoking cigars.

1042
00:46:41,541 --> 00:46:43,580
No,
really stopped drinking most of all.

1043
00:46:44,150 --> 00:46:47,480
And because we got to work to do,
we've got to run this country.

1044
00:46:47,510 --> 00:46:50,600
Democracy I say is puritanical for that 
reason.

1045
00:46:51,480 --> 00:46:55,650
So it's interesting because as you know,
you say you work with learn liberty,

1046
00:46:55,651 --> 00:46:58,500
their classical liberal organization.
They sent you to me.

1047
00:46:58,501 --> 00:46:59,334
I just want to make up nobody.
I want to make a point of sayIng that's 

1048
00:47:01,501 --> 00:47:02,334
why it's a beautiful thing that we're 
doing with them because you just said I 

1049
00:47:04,551 --> 00:47:06,900
am not a classical liberal,
were where do you.

1050
00:47:07,020 --> 00:47:07,853
If you had to give yourself a label,
I kNow you don't want to get hung up on 

1051
00:47:09,901 --> 00:47:10,734
that kind of stuff,
But I sense A lot of classical liberal 

1052
00:47:12,061 --> 00:47:14,070
stuff from you.
I send some libertarian stuff from you.

1053
00:47:14,190 --> 00:47:17,340
I sent some utility of the state from 
you.

1054
00:47:17,880 --> 00:47:19,230
What the hell is that?
I don't know.

1055
00:47:19,260 --> 00:47:20,100
Let's make up a new word.

1056
00:47:20,170 --> 00:47:21,220
I don't know.
I mean,

1057
00:47:21,230 --> 00:47:22,330
I don't know.
I,

1058
00:47:22,331 --> 00:47:24,460
I am.
I have sort of,

1059
00:47:24,461 --> 00:47:27,190
um,
culturally I guess I'm anarchistic.

1060
00:47:27,220 --> 00:47:31,780
I suppose I am.
I'm anti authority.

1061
00:47:31,840 --> 00:47:35,020
It doesn't mean I want to demolish 
authority and remove authority.

1062
00:47:35,021 --> 00:47:35,854
In fact,
I like that there are some people in 

1063
00:47:37,841 --> 00:47:40,840
this world who want to take charge 
because I don't want to do that work.

1064
00:47:41,100 --> 00:47:42,340
Right?
I don't want to do that work.

1065
00:47:42,880 --> 00:47:43,780
It's weird,
right?

1066
00:47:43,781 --> 00:47:44,614
That there are some people who just want
to manage everything and like take 

1067
00:47:46,360 --> 00:47:47,193
control and take care of everything.
I don't want to determine who picks up 

1068
00:47:49,541 --> 00:47:51,250
your garbage on monday morning.
I mean,

1069
00:47:51,251 --> 00:47:53,260
That's fine.
I'm glad you want to do that.

1070
00:47:53,770 --> 00:47:55,780
I'd rather play video games or whatever 
it is.

1071
00:47:55,781 --> 00:47:57,700
Right?
And so I don't know what that is.

1072
00:47:57,701 --> 00:47:58,660
I mean it's,
um,

1073
00:47:59,170 --> 00:48:01,390
that's why I like a lot of 
libertarianism,

1074
00:48:01,420 --> 00:48:02,253
you know,
obviously because they want the state 

1075
00:48:03,251 --> 00:48:04,120
out of our lives.

1076
00:48:04,390 --> 00:48:05,223
But a lot of libertarians have this 
classical idea of the self regulating 

1077
00:48:08,231 --> 00:48:10,360
individual.
They're right in the middle of it.

1078
00:48:10,361 --> 00:48:13,690
And so I don't like that at all because 
they're kind of not fun either.

1079
00:48:13,860 --> 00:48:14,693
They were actually.
A lot of libertarians remind me of the 

1080
00:48:16,061 --> 00:48:16,894
socialists that I grew up with.
They're very stodgy and very kind of 

1081
00:48:20,380 --> 00:48:21,213
uptight and controlled and not 
interested in the real world and the 

1082
00:48:24,251 --> 00:48:25,084
pleasures and the real world.
All the pleasure they get is from 

1083
00:48:27,521 --> 00:48:29,710
reading books,
whIch I understand,

1084
00:48:29,740 --> 00:48:31,840
but there's more to life than that.
You know,

1085
00:48:31,900 --> 00:48:35,320
this past week was,
or about a week ago is vidcon,

1086
00:48:35,321 --> 00:48:37,420
which is where all these youtubers get 
together.

1087
00:48:37,421 --> 00:48:39,490
I didn't go,
but a lot of the people that are sort of

1088
00:48:39,491 --> 00:48:40,324
in my youtube circles,
most of them are younger than me were 

1089
00:48:42,941 --> 00:48:43,774
there.
And it seemed like what I could gather 

1090
00:48:45,191 --> 00:48:46,024
was they were the fun group that there's
these people on the left that are 

1091
00:48:48,431 --> 00:48:51,010
screaming about the third wave feminism 
and all this stuff,

1092
00:48:51,190 --> 00:48:52,810
and then they're at a youtube 
conference.

1093
00:48:52,810 --> 00:48:55,150
It's not a lot of many people on the 
traditional right,

1094
00:48:55,360 --> 00:48:56,193
but that this new group,
whatever this thing is of these sorta 

1095
00:48:58,840 --> 00:49:01,240
half liberal libertarian mix,
whatever,

1096
00:49:01,470 --> 00:49:04,120
that they're the fun group and that's 
what's attracting people.

1097
00:49:04,180 --> 00:49:07,180
I think that was probably a lot of what 
was in the middle of gamer gate,

1098
00:49:07,240 --> 00:49:08,073
which was that there's these kids 
playing video games who like looking at 

1099
00:49:12,670 --> 00:49:15,940
women with big boobs and happy and 
enjoying it.

1100
00:49:16,150 --> 00:49:17,440
Right.
And that was about it.

1101
00:49:17,441 --> 00:49:19,150
I think for most of them I would 
imagine.

1102
00:49:19,151 --> 00:49:21,130
Right.
They like shooting people,

1103
00:49:21,220 --> 00:49:22,380
right?
Virtually,

1104
00:49:22,990 --> 00:49:24,820
you know,
and watching the heads explode,

1105
00:49:24,821 --> 00:49:26,140
which you're not allowed to do.
By the way,

1106
00:49:26,141 --> 00:49:26,974
that's another form of oppression that 
the puritans and the victorians 

1107
00:49:29,710 --> 00:49:30,543
instituted.
We can't fight each other in the 

1108
00:49:32,291 --> 00:49:34,510
streets.
That's an archaic and disorderly.

1109
00:49:34,570 --> 00:49:36,940
We have to let the state do all the 
killing for us.

1110
00:49:36,940 --> 00:49:38,470
Right?
We get the monopoly on violence,

1111
00:49:38,471 --> 00:49:40,030
the state does,
so you can't do that anymore.

1112
00:49:40,031 --> 00:49:42,580
So lIke boxing was shunned for a long 
time.

1113
00:49:43,090 --> 00:49:44,060
All these things,
you know.

1114
00:49:44,080 --> 00:49:46,290
And so I think,
I think video games represent sort of a,

1115
00:49:46,360 --> 00:49:47,193
a return of the repressed to use freud's
term in that way because these kids are 

1116
00:49:51,281 --> 00:49:52,114
doing stuff you're not allowed to do and
through these video games which is kill 

1117
00:49:54,910 --> 00:49:57,130
and have sex or at least some kind of 
sex,

1118
00:49:57,380 --> 00:50:00,040
sexual in that way.
And it's fun.

1119
00:50:00,070 --> 00:50:04,570
NoW we know that this didn't cause them 
to go out and shoot people.

1120
00:50:04,571 --> 00:50:07,480
We know that it didn't cause them to go 
out and rape people.

1121
00:50:07,510 --> 00:50:08,650
We know this from many,
many,

1122
00:50:08,651 --> 00:50:10,960
many studies with grace.
Every study,

1123
00:50:11,320 --> 00:50:12,180
every study,
okay.

1124
00:50:12,190 --> 00:50:13,630
So we just know that.
Um,

1125
00:50:14,050 --> 00:50:14,883
and so they were having fun doing this 
stuff that you're not allowed to do or 

1126
00:50:18,551 --> 00:50:19,660
even express.

1127
00:50:19,690 --> 00:50:23,260
You're not even allowed to express those
desires in this culture.

1128
00:50:23,261 --> 00:50:24,094
Right?
And then all of a sudden you have these 

1129
00:50:24,971 --> 00:50:25,804
people coming in and swooping in and 
telling them that not only what they're 

1130
00:50:29,330 --> 00:50:31,310
doing,
just their thoughts,

1131
00:50:31,311 --> 00:50:32,144
their feelings are bad.
But that it's going to cause another 

1132
00:50:34,431 --> 00:50:37,570
sandy hook and another mass rape 
somewhere and that it's,

1133
00:50:37,680 --> 00:50:40,050
it's the cause of the subjugation of 
women will.

1134
00:50:40,550 --> 00:50:42,600
It doesn't make sense to these kids.
And I'm,

1135
00:50:42,650 --> 00:50:45,290
I imagine,
and it's like we were just having fun in

1136
00:50:45,291 --> 00:50:47,070
our mom's basement.
We,

1137
00:50:47,080 --> 00:50:49,940
by the way,
we have zero institutional power in this

1138
00:50:49,941 --> 00:50:50,900
country.
Nothing,

1139
00:50:50,930 --> 00:50:53,840
nothing.
And you're telling us suddenly we're the

1140
00:50:53,841 --> 00:50:55,700
most powerful people in the world.
Now,

1141
00:50:55,701 --> 00:50:57,300
by the way,
I'm speaking for them now.

1142
00:50:59,090 --> 00:50:59,923
Here's what's so amazing to me.
It's like you've got a game or get hat 

1143
00:51:01,431 --> 00:51:03,740
for where you are.
Here's what's so amazing to me.

1144
00:51:03,740 --> 00:51:06,790
It's like why are feminists or went or 
any.

1145
00:51:06,920 --> 00:51:10,970
Why is everyone so concerned about what 
those people think?

1146
00:51:11,270 --> 00:51:12,103
Like that's what it becomes important in
a lot of feminist discourse is what we 

1147
00:51:15,801 --> 00:51:17,630
think.
What men think.

1148
00:51:18,140 --> 00:51:21,710
Well,
that all that does is sort of reinscribe

1149
00:51:21,711 --> 00:51:22,970
the patriarchy,
right?

1150
00:51:23,120 --> 00:51:27,290
What we think what we do is what's 
important but men do and think is what's

1151
00:51:27,291 --> 00:51:28,100
important.
Well,

1152
00:51:28,100 --> 00:51:31,430
how about just saY I'm going to do what 
I want to do and many feminists,

1153
00:51:31,431 --> 00:51:32,840
by the way have done this.
There's a,

1154
00:51:32,870 --> 00:51:33,703
there's a different strain of feminism 
that I love which has been called sex 

1155
00:51:36,591 --> 00:51:38,900
positive feminism or independent 
feminism.

1156
00:51:39,100 --> 00:51:39,933
Right.
So that's sort of more the christina 

1157
00:51:40,511 --> 00:51:41,344
hoff summers.
I know she doesn't focus that much on 

1158
00:51:42,521 --> 00:51:43,354
sex,
but she but more just like let them do 

1159
00:51:44,801 --> 00:51:45,320
their thing

1160
00:51:45,320 --> 00:51:46,310
maybe.
Yeah.

1161
00:51:46,311 --> 00:51:49,670
So I had a guest on my show,
her name is anna aerosmith,

1162
00:51:50,030 --> 00:51:50,863
she's a,
she was a feminist in and she hated 

1163
00:51:54,111 --> 00:51:54,944
pornography.
She thought it degraded Women and then 

1164
00:51:57,381 --> 00:51:59,390
she was walking down the street in soho 
in london,

1165
00:51:59,391 --> 00:52:00,224
which is the red light district 
basically in london thinking and 

1166
00:52:02,091 --> 00:52:03,970
watching all these shops full of these,
you know,

1167
00:52:04,010 --> 00:52:04,843
video video's sex oliver.
And she was turned on by it and she 

1168
00:52:08,961 --> 00:52:10,010
thought,
oh wait a minute,

1169
00:52:10,040 --> 00:52:12,440
I'm turned on by this,
but I don't like that.

1170
00:52:12,441 --> 00:52:14,750
So you know what I'm gonna do,
I'm going to make my own porn.

1171
00:52:15,080 --> 00:52:16,520
And so she started making your own 
parents.

1172
00:52:16,540 --> 00:52:19,220
She became the biggest female 
pornography in the world.

1173
00:52:20,030 --> 00:52:23,090
And did it on her own terms and it's all
hardcore.

1174
00:52:23,140 --> 00:52:25,580
There's nothing.
She doesn't hold any held anything back.

1175
00:52:25,581 --> 00:52:28,040
She just makes it nicer looking and the 
men are better looking,

1176
00:52:28,041 --> 00:52:30,020
et cetera.
And that's it.

1177
00:52:30,050 --> 00:52:31,250
To me,
that's feminism.

1178
00:52:31,340 --> 00:52:32,173
Do it on your own,
make your own world right instead of 

1179
00:52:35,150 --> 00:52:37,880
worrying constantly about what I want 
and what I think.

1180
00:52:38,120 --> 00:52:38,953
Yeah.
How unhealthy do you think just having 

1181
00:52:41,751 --> 00:52:42,584
to talk about politics all the time is.
I don't mean what we're doing right 

1182
00:52:45,291 --> 00:52:45,620
here,
right?

1183
00:52:45,620 --> 00:52:49,370
So I don't mean for the people that have
these conversations about ideas in that,

1184
00:52:49,371 --> 00:52:53,000
but I mean for the average person that 
all day long now because of social media

1185
00:52:53,450 --> 00:52:54,283
is harping about every little decision 
that happens in the government and that 

1186
00:52:57,711 --> 00:53:00,050
I,
it's strikes me as it's becoming,

1187
00:53:00,080 --> 00:53:04,090
it's starting to like really rocked 
people's minds or something like,

1188
00:53:04,100 --> 00:53:04,933
I would argue that a good government is 
one that's small enough that you 

1189
00:53:06,771 --> 00:53:08,270
wouldn't have to talk about it all the 
time.

1190
00:53:08,510 --> 00:53:09,343
Now this,
there's probably good counter arguments 

1191
00:53:10,701 --> 00:53:11,534
to that,
but the idea that people are all day 

1192
00:53:13,550 --> 00:53:16,850
worried about this seems like a real 
problem.

1193
00:53:17,220 --> 00:53:18,660
Well,
so when you say people,

1194
00:53:19,550 --> 00:53:20,383
you know,
I mean,

1195
00:53:20,580 --> 00:53:22,230
how many people are we talking about?
Again?

1196
00:53:22,231 --> 00:53:23,870
I think it's right.
It's hard to gauge is the.

1197
00:53:23,910 --> 00:53:25,680
I think it's a lot of people to each 
other,

1198
00:53:25,710 --> 00:53:26,543
right?
I think it's a pretty small world that 

1199
00:53:27,661 --> 00:53:29,700
we inhabit or that we observe.
Right?

1200
00:53:29,730 --> 00:53:31,020
I think the,
I think most.

1201
00:53:31,021 --> 00:53:31,854
Well what is it?
Twenty five percent of americans are on 

1202
00:53:33,061 --> 00:53:33,871
twitter.
Okay.

1203
00:53:33,871 --> 00:53:35,610
So that's a quarter.
That's a pretty big chunk.

1204
00:53:35,860 --> 00:53:36,693
But of those,
how many just read what katy perry's 

1205
00:53:38,731 --> 00:53:39,361
feed,
right?

1206
00:53:39,361 --> 00:53:42,300
I mean I think that those who do 
politics

1207
00:53:42,500 --> 00:53:45,410
bar bizarrely political though because 
of doing stuff with hillary,

1208
00:53:45,411 --> 00:53:46,120
so.
Okay.

1209
00:53:46,120 --> 00:53:46,440
Yeah.

1210
00:53:46,440 --> 00:53:47,273
But let's say,
you know what's called political 

1211
00:53:48,211 --> 00:53:49,230
twitter,
I don't know,

1212
00:53:49,231 --> 00:53:50,620
but how many people are there?
Right?

1213
00:53:51,420 --> 00:53:53,520
And how many people there are just,
you know,

1214
00:53:53,521 --> 00:53:55,470
just check in on the democratic party's 
latest,

1215
00:53:55,510 --> 00:53:57,570
you know,
announcements,

1216
00:53:57,571 --> 00:53:59,490
right?
I think it's a pretty small world.

1217
00:53:59,491 --> 00:54:02,100
I'm not too worried about the population
in general.

1218
00:54:02,130 --> 00:54:02,963
Um,
but I do think that the world that you 

1219
00:54:04,261 --> 00:54:08,700
and I have chosen to live in is pretty 
uncomfortable.

1220
00:54:08,940 --> 00:54:11,040
And I'd say since the election in 
particular,

1221
00:54:11,041 --> 00:54:11,874
it's nearly intolerable,
so I used to be a twitter addict and 

1222
00:54:15,121 --> 00:54:17,460
then since the election it's actually 
been really hard.

1223
00:54:17,490 --> 00:54:20,760
It's not been fun to go on twitter.
It really almost never is funded.

1224
00:54:20,800 --> 00:54:25,200
Almost always makes me sad or angry.
And so I watch it less,

1225
00:54:25,230 --> 00:54:27,270
you know,
and I don't know,

1226
00:54:27,330 --> 00:54:28,163
I think that may be the next phase we're
going to go through the twitter will 

1227
00:54:30,211 --> 00:54:32,820
become something else or there will be 
alternatives to it and you know,

1228
00:54:32,821 --> 00:54:33,654
it's just people talking.
The thing is to just keep going and not 

1229
00:54:37,890 --> 00:54:38,160
a,
no,

1230
00:54:38,160 --> 00:54:38,993
it's hard,
but to not let the eggs with the five 

1231
00:54:41,401 --> 00:54:43,080
followers get to you,
they get to me,

1232
00:54:44,010 --> 00:54:46,710
but we just have to keep going if we 
want to do this.

1233
00:54:47,730 --> 00:54:48,563
Um,

1234
00:54:49,220 --> 00:54:52,340
what about the amount of time that we're
spending on this?

1235
00:54:52,341 --> 00:54:54,260
That I think that's really what I meant.
They're not just,

1236
00:54:54,380 --> 00:54:55,213
not just the griping but the amount of 
time people are worried about these 

1237
00:54:57,861 --> 00:54:59,720
things.
LIke the broader people.

1238
00:54:59,870 --> 00:55:00,620
Yeah.
I mean,

1239
00:55:00,620 --> 00:55:02,230
well,
the thing that I don't like is there,

1240
00:55:02,550 --> 00:55:05,280
the policing that goes on,
it's a constant policing,

1241
00:55:05,310 --> 00:55:06,143
right?
You said this and you shouldn't say 

1242
00:55:07,591 --> 00:55:08,700
that.
You shouldn't think this,

1243
00:55:08,701 --> 00:55:11,400
you shouldn't feel this.
You need to check yourself.

1244
00:55:11,401 --> 00:55:13,650
You need to watch yourself.
It's all,

1245
00:55:13,651 --> 00:55:15,670
it's a totalitarian language.
Um,

1246
00:55:15,840 --> 00:55:17,340
which again,
by the way it comes out of the frankfurt

1247
00:55:17,341 --> 00:55:18,960
school.
It does,

1248
00:55:19,620 --> 00:55:20,453
which their argument was that language 
is this tool of the oppressor against 

1249
00:55:23,581 --> 00:55:25,110
the oppressed.
And so we need to,

1250
00:55:25,170 --> 00:55:26,003
we need to recapture the language and 
make it our own to bring about 

1251
00:55:29,161 --> 00:55:30,930
revolution.
That was the frankfurt school.

1252
00:55:31,380 --> 00:55:32,770
Um,
it's,

1253
00:55:32,850 --> 00:55:36,690
it's a totalitarian impulse.
It's a totalitarian politics.

1254
00:55:38,320 --> 00:55:41,520
It's no fun to be around.
And I think that's the thing.

1255
00:55:42,240 --> 00:55:43,073
People are just,
they're repudiating it sort of tacitly 

1256
00:55:45,840 --> 00:55:48,060
in that they are there watching their 
video.

1257
00:55:48,061 --> 00:55:48,894
They're,
they're playing video games instead 

1258
00:55:49,501 --> 00:55:52,700
they're watching television instead.
They're not engaging in this discourse.

1259
00:55:52,720 --> 00:55:54,660
You and I are masochists because we do 
It.

1260
00:55:55,320 --> 00:55:57,060
Most people are not masochists in that 
way.

1261
00:55:57,061 --> 00:55:59,040
So that's,
to me the cause for hope.

1262
00:55:59,170 --> 00:56:02,260
Yeah.
It's so funny because I enjoy 90 percent

1263
00:56:02,261 --> 00:56:05,890
of this.
There is that 10 percent of just,

1264
00:56:05,920 --> 00:56:06,753
you know,
when people are malicious lead 

1265
00:56:08,051 --> 00:56:11,020
misquoting me or writing things that are
blatantly not true,

1266
00:56:11,230 --> 00:56:14,150
the rest of the interaction,
I can basically deal with it.

1267
00:56:14,151 --> 00:56:16,930
I do love the battle of ideas,
but believe me,

1268
00:56:16,931 --> 00:56:18,090
I hear you.
There's,

1269
00:56:18,270 --> 00:56:19,103
there's like an unspoken thing that we 
can do here that I can't quite quantify 

1270
00:56:22,061 --> 00:56:23,440
in words.
So curious.

1271
00:56:23,441 --> 00:56:26,590
So all this being said,
you have an interesting mix,

1272
00:56:26,650 --> 00:56:27,483
you know,
a mixed match of politics and culture 

1273
00:56:30,401 --> 00:56:31,234
and all that stuff.
Is there anyone in politics right now 

1274
00:56:33,221 --> 00:56:34,360
that,
that you like,

1275
00:56:34,361 --> 00:56:35,040
that you go,
oh,

1276
00:56:35,040 --> 00:56:36,490
this guy kinda gets it.

1277
00:56:37,010 --> 00:56:39,310
No.
Electoral politics.

1278
00:56:39,340 --> 00:56:40,570
Yeah.
just anyone right now.

1279
00:56:41,380 --> 00:56:44,680
Who in the public space in general,
like is there like a couple?

1280
00:56:44,681 --> 00:56:45,690
Is there anyone

1281
00:56:45,880 --> 00:56:47,410
in electoral politics?
There's no one.

1282
00:56:47,640 --> 00:56:48,160
I mean,
in fact,

1283
00:56:48,160 --> 00:56:48,993
I thought trump was interesting in these
ways that he was at least raising these 

1284
00:56:51,851 --> 00:56:53,980
questions for the first time.
I mean,

1285
00:56:53,981 --> 00:56:56,620
I can't stand most of what he's for in 
terms of policy,

1286
00:56:56,621 --> 00:56:58,990
but he was raising these questions for 
the first time,

1287
00:56:58,991 --> 00:57:00,670
so I got to talk about them.
That was great.

1288
00:57:00,671 --> 00:57:01,504
Thank you for the opportunity.
Now leave office and just please don't 

1289
00:57:04,301 --> 00:57:06,100
do anything when you're an office is the
Best thing.

1290
00:57:06,101 --> 00:57:06,934
But no,
in electoral politics there's no one 

1291
00:57:08,891 --> 00:57:09,724
because they are part of the machine or 
at least they want to be part of the 

1292
00:57:12,131 --> 00:57:12,964
machine.
So being part of the machine means 

1293
00:57:14,171 --> 00:57:16,720
making yourself a cog right?
Uninteresting,

1294
00:57:18,520 --> 00:57:20,450
uninteresting to me.
Um,

1295
00:57:21,180 --> 00:57:23,560
there are very few cultural radicals 
left.

1296
00:57:23,561 --> 00:57:26,170
There are a few sort of sex radicals.
There's like three,

1297
00:57:26,320 --> 00:57:27,610
you know,
I find them interesting,

1298
00:57:27,640 --> 00:57:28,510
you know,
people who say,

1299
00:57:28,511 --> 00:57:30,640
yeah,
we should talk about sex.

1300
00:57:30,641 --> 00:57:33,250
We should be able to express our desires
openly.

1301
00:57:33,300 --> 00:57:34,450
Uh,
it's better.

1302
00:57:34,480 --> 00:57:37,220
Sex is a good thing.
Sex is noT about a,

1303
00:57:37,660 --> 00:57:40,480
they almost don't exist.
The sixties had that,

1304
00:57:40,570 --> 00:57:41,403
the new left and the counterculture had 
some people there who were quite 

1305
00:57:43,631 --> 00:57:46,720
interesting in that way,
but they're gone and it's very sad.

1306
00:57:46,870 --> 00:57:47,710
Yeah,
it's inteResting.

1307
00:57:47,711 --> 00:57:50,410
There's this writer,
I forget what he writes for even,

1308
00:57:50,411 --> 00:57:51,244
but I don't know if you saw this thing 
where he took a screen capture of his 

1309
00:57:52,681 --> 00:57:55,990
screen and one of these tabs had hentai 
porn on it,

1310
00:57:55,991 --> 00:57:57,850
which I guess is like octopus 
foreigners,

1311
00:57:57,851 --> 00:58:00,490
I don't know,
some like some cartoon porn at,

1312
00:58:00,560 --> 00:58:03,490
but he's a lefty,
so all these people on this.

1313
00:58:03,491 --> 00:58:04,360
All right.
You know,

1314
00:58:04,361 --> 00:58:06,700
these,
anything goes over here.

1315
00:58:06,820 --> 00:58:08,620
They were all attacking him and I was 
like,

1316
00:58:08,730 --> 00:58:11,440
do you guys not see the irony in what 
you're doing here?

1317
00:58:11,441 --> 00:58:14,050
like it wasn't illegal what he was 
doing.

1318
00:58:14,051 --> 00:58:15,850
It was some odd thing,
you know,

1319
00:58:16,150 --> 00:58:18,660
but I though you guys are the free 
being,

1320
00:58:18,670 --> 00:58:19,670
you know.
All righty.

1321
00:58:19,770 --> 00:58:20,603
I mean,
a lot of the left I would imagine It 

1322
00:58:21,810 --> 00:58:23,910
would attack him too.
I mean they have in the past,

1323
00:58:23,911 --> 00:58:24,510
right?
Because that's,

1324
00:58:24,510 --> 00:58:26,100
you know,
that's the objectification of women.

1325
00:58:26,101 --> 00:58:28,200
So we can't have that.
Um,

1326
00:58:28,650 --> 00:58:29,161
yeah,
no,

1327
00:58:29,161 --> 00:58:29,631
it's,
it's,

1328
00:58:29,631 --> 00:58:31,280
it's not fun.
Um,

1329
00:58:31,380 --> 00:58:33,030
but.
So in terms of.

1330
00:58:34,730 --> 00:58:35,040
Yeah,
no,

1331
00:58:35,040 --> 00:58:35,873
I guess I,
I guess it's sort of my mission to kind 

1332
00:58:37,141 --> 00:58:39,300
of bring back that kind of.
and it is left wing.

1333
00:58:39,301 --> 00:58:40,620
here's,
here's part of my politics too,

1334
00:58:40,621 --> 00:58:41,454
it's like that sort of left cultural 
radicalism back into political 

1335
00:58:45,811 --> 00:58:48,240
discourse,
which is just doesn't exist really.

1336
00:58:48,340 --> 00:58:51,100
So when you say left cultural radical 
radicalism,

1337
00:58:51,101 --> 00:58:51,934
you meet,
you actually do mean freedom In that 

1338
00:58:54,251 --> 00:58:55,084
context.
it doesn't sound like something that's 

1339
00:58:56,111 --> 00:58:57,820
of the modern left now,
but that's what you're.

1340
00:58:58,120 --> 00:59:01,120
You're talkIng about real great art or 
you're talking about great comedy,

1341
00:59:01,330 --> 00:59:02,140
all of those things.

1342
00:59:02,140 --> 00:59:02,973
Yeah.
I'm talking about lenny bruce and 

1343
00:59:04,361 --> 00:59:06,770
richard pryor.
You talked about standup comics.

1344
00:59:06,930 --> 00:59:09,010
Those are my heroes.
Those are my original heroes.

1345
00:59:09,011 --> 00:59:12,820
Richard pryor is my original hero 
because he did that.

1346
00:59:12,821 --> 00:59:14,050
He just said,
he said,

1347
00:59:14,051 --> 00:59:14,890
well,
you're not supposed to say.

1348
00:59:15,430 --> 00:59:16,780
He said what?
You're not supposed to say.

1349
00:59:16,781 --> 00:59:17,614
That's what great comedy is.
That's what makes us laugh and that's 

1350
00:59:20,111 --> 00:59:21,880
what makes them so brilliant.
You know?

1351
00:59:22,190 --> 00:59:24,770
And yeah.
I don't know if that's lost,

1352
00:59:24,890 --> 00:59:27,160
but it's certainly being challenged.
Oh,

1353
00:59:27,170 --> 00:59:29,090
It's being.
It's just being squeezed.

1354
00:59:29,091 --> 00:59:32,300
Lenny bruce went to prison for that.
Okay,

1355
00:59:32,301 --> 00:59:33,134
and so do we want to return to that?
Do we want to put comedians in jail for 

1356
00:59:37,011 --> 00:59:38,750
saying things you're not supposed to 
say?

1357
00:59:39,170 --> 00:59:42,490
Not doing things you're not supposed to 
do,

1358
00:59:42,620 --> 00:59:44,780
sayIng things you're not supposed to 
think.

1359
00:59:44,960 --> 00:59:48,530
Giving voice to the taboo,
giving voice to the forbidden.

1360
00:59:48,710 --> 00:59:49,760
That's what they do.

1361
00:59:50,030 --> 00:59:50,863
Shouldn't we have that?
Imagine what would be happening if 

1362
00:59:53,151 --> 00:59:55,280
george carlin who would be 80 years old 
right now,

1363
00:59:55,281 --> 00:59:57,200
we still trying to go to college 
campuses.

1364
00:59:57,530 --> 01:00:02,150
They'd be screaming about this old white
man who's saying all of these things.

1365
01:00:02,151 --> 01:00:04,670
This is a massive problem.
That's why,

1366
01:00:04,671 --> 01:00:08,350
by the way,
I was so dispirited,

1367
01:00:08,510 --> 01:00:13,510
I guess by bill maher's apology because 
everyone knows he's not racist,

1368
01:00:14,090 --> 01:00:14,923
so I'm not saying that I'm going to sit 
here and want to use that word if it 

1369
01:00:17,361 --> 01:00:20,330
bothers people.
Of course speech has consequences.

1370
01:00:20,331 --> 01:00:24,100
I understand that,
but the apology struck me as man,

1371
01:00:24,590 --> 01:00:27,380
a comedian who's been the hero of the 
left,

1372
01:00:27,381 --> 01:00:31,250
has to now bow to them.
This strikes me as a major problem.

1373
01:00:31,340 --> 01:00:32,990
Okay,
you ready to get into more trouble dive?

1374
01:00:33,020 --> 01:00:33,761
Let's go.
Okay,

1375
01:00:33,761 --> 01:00:38,420
so nigger is arguably the most important
word in american history.

1376
01:00:38,990 --> 01:00:42,260
If we don't use that word,
we're not serious about understanding.

1377
01:00:42,260 --> 01:00:45,410
American history were not serious,
but understandIng that this culture,

1378
01:00:45,740 --> 01:00:48,920
you can be an antiracist or a racist or 
anything,

1379
01:00:48,950 --> 01:00:49,783
but if you don't talk about that word 
and he used that word the way it's been 

1380
01:00:52,461 --> 01:00:55,040
used in history,
not to hurt people,

1381
01:00:55,460 --> 01:00:58,880
not as an epithet,
but to simply refer to it.

1382
01:00:58,970 --> 01:01:00,260
Right?
We can't do that.

1383
01:01:00,380 --> 01:01:03,710
We're not grownups here.
We're not being serious about ideas,

1384
01:01:03,711 --> 01:01:05,090
about history,
about our culture,

1385
01:01:05,091 --> 01:01:07,340
about America.
We can't understand it,

1386
01:01:07,460 --> 01:01:08,293
and that's really what it is.
It's avoiding these ideas rather than 

1387
01:01:11,120 --> 01:01:11,953
hitting them head on.
People talk about slavery as if they 

1388
01:01:14,481 --> 01:01:16,760
know anything.
They don't know anything about slavery.

1389
01:01:16,761 --> 01:01:17,594
They just know that it was wrong and 
there was whipping his all day long and 

1390
01:01:19,791 --> 01:01:20,624
it was nothing but rape and torture.
Having never read a thing about the 

1391
01:01:23,661 --> 01:01:25,370
history of slavery.
It's the same thing,

1392
01:01:25,371 --> 01:01:26,090
right?
It's.

1393
01:01:26,090 --> 01:01:31,090
It's when you moralize write about ideas
that is anti intellectual,

1394
01:01:31,850 --> 01:01:32,870
that is saying,
oh,

1395
01:01:32,871 --> 01:01:35,120
this thing is outside the realm of 
discourse.

1396
01:01:35,330 --> 01:01:40,330
This is outside the realm of inquiry.
It's anti intellectual and it's lazy and

1397
01:01:40,400 --> 01:01:43,400
I would say it leads to things that are 
worse.

1398
01:01:43,460 --> 01:01:44,293
It leads to things like Donald Trump 
because you are repressing again these 

1399
01:01:47,601 --> 01:01:48,434
ideas and there are people who just 
won't be repressed and they're going to 

1400
01:01:50,961 --> 01:01:53,210
come back and they're going to say,
yeah,

1401
01:01:53,300 --> 01:01:54,133
you're playing identity politics.
You're saying there's blackness and 

1402
01:01:57,231 --> 01:01:58,910
whiteness and you're black and I'm 
white.

1403
01:01:58,911 --> 01:01:59,331
Well,
okay,

1404
01:01:59,331 --> 01:02:01,250
fine.
Now I'm going to say I'm about whiteness

1405
01:02:01,251 --> 01:02:04,310
and being white.
So that's the problem there.

1406
01:02:04,311 --> 01:02:05,051
I mean it's,
it's,

1407
01:02:05,051 --> 01:02:07,580
it's a very bad thing to avoid that we 
have to use these words.

1408
01:02:07,581 --> 01:02:08,414
Yeah.
It's so interesting because I've heard 

1409
01:02:09,111 --> 01:02:09,944
people make that argument.
I saw my friend michael shermer make 

1410
01:02:12,711 --> 01:02:13,544
that argument about that you're just 
creating an identity politics of white 

1411
01:02:17,181 --> 01:02:17,510
people.

1412
01:02:17,510 --> 01:02:20,640
And I saw him get into a fight with,
with some leftist professor on twitter.

1413
01:02:20,641 --> 01:02:21,301
And I,
by the way,

1414
01:02:21,301 --> 01:02:22,134
I,
I offered her an opportunity to come 

1415
01:02:23,401 --> 01:02:24,810
here and defend her ideas.
She declined.

1416
01:02:25,110 --> 01:02:26,370
Um,
but I,

1417
01:02:26,371 --> 01:02:27,204
I so obviously see that,
but it also leads to all sorts of other 

1418
01:02:28,861 --> 01:02:33,270
cultural rot because by taking the word 
out of huck finn,

1419
01:02:33,690 --> 01:02:34,770
well now you.
Well,

1420
01:02:34,830 --> 01:02:37,440
that was a book that's it's not only 
stood the test of time,

1421
01:02:37,441 --> 01:02:39,960
but now you're altering the original 
meaning.

1422
01:02:40,320 --> 01:02:42,750
Not to mention that huck finn was 
antiracist at book,

1423
01:02:43,350 --> 01:02:44,183
which as bill maher has been anti,
but the point needs to be made that if 

1424
01:02:47,461 --> 01:02:48,294
it were racist,
we still have to use the word not as an 

1425
01:02:51,151 --> 01:02:51,961
epithet.
Again,

1426
01:02:51,961 --> 01:02:52,794
not the way the racist used the word,
but we have to be able to talk about 

1427
01:02:55,860 --> 01:02:57,540
racism.
We're not.

1428
01:02:57,570 --> 01:02:57,870
Here's the.

1429
01:02:57,870 --> 01:03:02,670
Here's the terrible irony is that by not
being allowed to use that word,

1430
01:03:02,970 --> 01:03:06,900
we are not allowed to talk about racism.
We're not allowed to study it.

1431
01:03:06,901 --> 01:03:08,520
Think about it.
Take it seriously.

1432
01:03:08,640 --> 01:03:10,920
Right.
It's like in Germany,

1433
01:03:10,921 --> 01:03:11,754
you're not allowed to basically talk 
about nazi-ism unless you just sorta 

1434
01:03:13,470 --> 01:03:14,303
moralize it really quickly.
Wouldn't you rather as a jew or an anti 

1435
01:03:16,981 --> 01:03:17,814
nazi or any.
Once you rather a study it really hard 

1436
01:03:20,461 --> 01:03:22,980
really closely and if you don't want to 
return to that,

1437
01:03:23,480 --> 01:03:24,001
well,
it's why.

1438
01:03:24,001 --> 01:03:26,550
I mean as a free speech guy,
it's why I'm completely against the laws

1439
01:03:26,551 --> 01:03:29,980
that criminalize holocaust denial 
because they're.

1440
01:03:29,990 --> 01:03:30,823
They're not going to stop denying it,
they're just going to go into their 

1441
01:03:32,191 --> 01:03:34,350
secret little places and I'd rather 
have.

1442
01:03:34,440 --> 01:03:35,273
There are more real nazis in Germany 
than in than in the United States where 

1443
01:03:38,551 --> 01:03:39,750
we are allowed to talk about it.

1444
01:03:39,920 --> 01:03:40,753
Yeah.
Yeah.

1445
01:03:41,820 --> 01:03:42,990
But okay,
so you just,

1446
01:03:42,991 --> 01:03:43,824
so you said the word now I know a 
certain amount of people can be angry 

1447
01:03:46,110 --> 01:03:48,990
because I have not said the word a 
while.

1448
01:03:48,991 --> 01:03:49,824
Sitting here with you right this second.
You know that there's a certain costs 

1449
01:03:52,621 --> 01:03:53,970
there.
You know what I mean,

1450
01:03:53,971 --> 01:03:55,170
like,
yeah.

1451
01:03:55,200 --> 01:03:58,320
And it just has.
You've just sort of shifted past that.

1452
01:03:58,840 --> 01:04:00,170
You've hit your,
you,

1453
01:04:00,290 --> 01:04:02,910
you've made your sorta philosophical 
point now it's just.

1454
01:04:02,940 --> 01:04:04,440
Yeah.
And so just I would just say,

1455
01:04:04,490 --> 01:04:05,323
just listened to what I say after the 
word because I very clearly put forward 

1456
01:04:10,350 --> 01:04:15,350
why we should use that word and I'm 
pretty sure what I said was anti racist.

1457
01:04:15,840 --> 01:04:17,550
Yes.
Anti racist.

1458
01:04:17,551 --> 01:04:21,990
That antiracism requires using the word 
nigger.

1459
01:04:22,950 --> 01:04:24,510
And that's why all this has been 
flipped.

1460
01:04:24,511 --> 01:04:25,344
So then at evergreen state,
to bring this back to 40 minutes ago at 

1461
01:04:28,321 --> 01:04:29,760
evergreen state,
you have a professor,

1462
01:04:29,761 --> 01:04:30,594
bret weinstein,
who was being anti racist and now he is 

1463
01:04:35,401 --> 01:04:36,240
smeared,
racist.

1464
01:04:36,270 --> 01:04:39,270
So I guess that's what it is when you 
don't deal with the truth,

1465
01:04:39,271 --> 01:04:40,104
honestly,
you end up having to destroy anyone who 

1466
01:04:42,391 --> 01:04:44,430
even gets close to it.
Yeah,

1467
01:04:44,880 --> 01:04:46,070
yeah.
Uh,

1468
01:04:46,080 --> 01:04:47,220
yeah.
Evergreen is,

1469
01:04:47,221 --> 01:04:49,470
I'm not a good luck.
I would say,

1470
01:04:50,330 --> 01:04:51,660
uh,
you know,

1471
01:04:51,661 --> 01:04:52,494
it's,
I dunno if you want to go into this too 

1472
01:04:54,330 --> 01:04:55,021
much,
but you know,

1473
01:04:55,021 --> 01:04:57,480
a lot of,
there's a lot that's not said about what

1474
01:04:57,810 --> 01:05:01,830
causes this craziness on campuses,
which is that,

1475
01:05:01,890 --> 01:05:02,723
you know,
there's a monopoly that no one talks 

1476
01:05:04,861 --> 01:05:06,180
about it.
No one's even aware of this.

1477
01:05:06,181 --> 01:05:07,014
In fact,
I wasn't even aware of it until 

1478
01:05:07,621 --> 01:05:09,020
recently.
The,

1479
01:05:09,080 --> 01:05:09,913
the department of education and the 
federal government authorizes 

1480
01:05:13,980 --> 01:05:17,310
accreditation agencies,
accreditation agencies,

1481
01:05:17,410 --> 01:05:20,470
accredited colleges and universities,
and they have all these rules.

1482
01:05:20,471 --> 01:05:22,090
It's not,
you can't just become a college.

1483
01:05:22,091 --> 01:05:24,760
You have to have all these things in 
place for them to accredit you.

1484
01:05:25,090 --> 01:05:28,240
Without accreditation.
The world doesn't take you seriously.

1485
01:05:28,241 --> 01:05:29,730
Employers don't take you seriously,
right?

1486
01:05:29,740 --> 01:05:32,110
The credentialing is crucial to this.
Okay?

1487
01:05:32,770 --> 01:05:33,603
It's the federal government at the head 
of this whole thing of this monopoly 

1488
01:05:36,791 --> 01:05:37,720
that they have.
Right?

1489
01:05:38,020 --> 01:05:39,970
Then on top of that,
there's another monopoly within it,

1490
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:41,680
which is tenure,
the tenure system,

1491
01:05:41,740 --> 01:05:43,690
right?
So after seven years,

1492
01:05:43,691 --> 01:05:44,524
if you're lucky and you're good and you 
follow the rules and you say the right 

1493
01:05:47,021 --> 01:05:49,810
things,
you get tenure and you're there forever.

1494
01:05:50,020 --> 01:05:52,060
Now who do you think you're going to 
hire once you have tenure?

1495
01:05:52,450 --> 01:05:53,283
Someone who is who is contrary to your 
ideas or someone who might agree with 

1496
01:05:56,231 --> 01:05:57,064
you,
someone who makes you look good or 

1497
01:05:58,001 --> 01:06:02,500
someone who challenges you.
Hence we have this uniformity of opinion

1498
01:06:02,680 --> 01:06:05,470
in academia,
which is supported,

1499
01:06:05,530 --> 01:06:08,380
defended,
bolstered by this federal government,

1500
01:06:08,560 --> 01:06:11,170
state and force monopoly.
No one knows this.

1501
01:06:11,470 --> 01:06:13,930
That's what's going on here.
Third thing,

1502
01:06:13,990 --> 01:06:17,890
last thing you add to this,
this system of affirmative action,

1503
01:06:17,950 --> 01:06:18,783
okay,
which brings people onto campus who 

1504
01:06:21,880 --> 01:06:24,430
according to the rules of affirmative 
action,

1505
01:06:24,670 --> 01:06:29,670
have less training in academic work than
other kids.

1506
01:06:30,010 --> 01:06:30,843
So when they get there,
of course it's going to be more 

1507
01:06:32,831 --> 01:06:34,990
difficult for them to do the academic 
work.

1508
01:06:35,350 --> 01:06:37,030
Also,
it has been stated,

1509
01:06:37,090 --> 01:06:42,090
the purpose of diversity and affirmative
action is to have these people represent

1510
01:06:42,520 --> 01:06:45,100
their race.
Right.

1511
01:06:45,350 --> 01:06:49,150
And so imagine how crazy that would make
you feel in a classroom when you're like

1512
01:06:49,151 --> 01:06:54,151
one black kid or one whatever kid or two
black kids out of 30 and everybody knows

1513
01:06:55,181 --> 01:06:56,014
why you're there and you're supposed to 
represent your race and people are 

1514
01:07:00,880 --> 01:07:04,210
wondering assuming that you don't have 
the credentials that they do.

1515
01:07:05,170 --> 01:07:06,003
That would make me crazy too.
And so I almost everything that's been 

1516
01:07:08,741 --> 01:07:13,510
said in the race discourse on campuses 
over the last three years has been to me

1517
01:07:13,930 --> 01:07:18,130
fraudulent or hysterical and much of it 
has been totalitarian by the way.

1518
01:07:18,790 --> 01:07:22,780
But I think there is something at the 
bottom of it that's legitimate.

1519
01:07:22,781 --> 01:07:23,614
There's a legitimate grievance that 
african american students have 

1520
01:07:25,331 --> 01:07:27,810
oncologists that's not addressed.
The w,

1521
01:07:27,880 --> 01:07:28,713
the tools.
They have to talk about this our only 

1522
01:07:31,391 --> 01:07:33,940
martin luther king and rosa parks and 
malcolm x and you know,

1523
01:07:34,120 --> 01:07:37,110
bull connor and oppression and slavery.
So that's the.

1524
01:07:37,280 --> 01:07:38,113
That's the,
that's the way they talk about it and 

1525
01:07:39,821 --> 01:07:40,654
that's uh,
that's unfortunate and that's the fault 

1526
01:07:41,741 --> 01:07:44,330
of their professors.
We need to give them language to be able

1527
01:07:44,331 --> 01:07:46,900
to talk about what's really going on,
which is not good.

1528
01:07:46,901 --> 01:07:49,720
It's not fun for them.
It's hard.

1529
01:07:49,721 --> 01:07:52,360
I absolutely get that.
It could feel oppressive really.

1530
01:07:52,361 --> 01:07:54,490
That word is the word I would use if I 
were them,

1531
01:07:55,510 --> 01:07:57,190
but it's not the oppression they're 
talking about.

1532
01:07:57,191 --> 01:08:00,550
There is no physical threat to them.
There never has been there,

1533
01:08:00,551 --> 01:08:01,400
but they're.
Yeah.

1534
01:08:02,180 --> 01:08:03,013
Interesting.
Yeah.

1535
01:08:03,250 --> 01:08:05,660
I referenced my interview with jason 
whitlock miller,

1536
01:08:05,661 --> 01:08:06,494
but he,
he saId something to that effect that 

1537
01:08:07,551 --> 01:08:09,590
basically the oppression is different 
now.

1538
01:08:10,070 --> 01:08:10,903
Uh,
and you have to then change tactics you 

1539
01:08:12,651 --> 01:08:15,310
can't be doing fighting the way that,
say,

1540
01:08:15,390 --> 01:08:16,223
a Jesse Jackson or a,
a al sharpton is using the language of 

1541
01:08:20,001 --> 01:08:22,770
the old thing when there's a whole 
different system in play.

1542
01:08:22,771 --> 01:08:23,450
Right,
right.

1543
01:08:23,450 --> 01:08:25,340
Where you could get more natural allies.

1544
01:08:25,490 --> 01:08:26,990
Yeah.
And I'm only talkIng about academia.

1545
01:08:27,010 --> 01:08:27,311
Yeah.
Okay.

1546
01:08:27,311 --> 01:08:29,840
I'm not talking about being a 19 year 
old in ferguson,

1547
01:08:29,841 --> 01:08:32,330
Missouri.
ThAt's a different ballgame entirely.

1548
01:08:32,690 --> 01:08:35,150
I'm talking about academia and I know 
that world very well.

1549
01:08:35,151 --> 01:08:35,984
Those are the rules of the world and 
that's what happens to these black kids 

1550
01:08:38,330 --> 01:08:39,530
there plucked out of these 
neighborhoods,

1551
01:08:39,531 --> 01:08:40,880
put in these classrooms and said,
oh,

1552
01:08:40,970 --> 01:08:43,910
go ahead represent your race.
We're goIng to pay you to do that.

1553
01:08:44,900 --> 01:08:46,250
Well,
that's going to make you crazy.

1554
01:08:46,251 --> 01:08:47,084
So that's a different.
It's what I call liberal or racial 

1555
01:08:50,211 --> 01:08:51,044
liberalism.
It's this idea of the representative 

1556
01:08:53,931 --> 01:08:58,760
race and the idea that we will give them
the chance to prove themselves that they

1557
01:08:58,761 --> 01:09:02,630
can be just like us.
So there's an assimilationist impulse in

1558
01:09:02,631 --> 01:09:05,210
there too,
or an assimilation is the expectation.

1559
01:09:05,930 --> 01:09:09,080
We're going to show the world that these
black people can be just like us,

1560
01:09:09,081 --> 01:09:12,350
which by the way is kind of white 
supremacist in a way,

1561
01:09:12,351 --> 01:09:13,190
right?
Because they're sayiNg,

1562
01:09:13,191 --> 01:09:14,930
well,
our world of course is the Best one.

1563
01:09:15,110 --> 01:09:16,940
HArvard of course,
is the best place to be.

1564
01:09:17,630 --> 01:09:18,463
That's incredibly elitist and superior 
and probably white supremacists because 

1565
01:09:21,111 --> 01:09:23,840
harvard of course is historically a very
white institution,

1566
01:09:24,290 --> 01:09:27,290
so just let people do what they want to 
do.

1567
01:09:27,320 --> 01:09:29,840
We don't have to expect them to go to 
harvard.

1568
01:09:30,850 --> 01:09:33,250
Well,
I suspect we're going to do this again,

1569
01:09:33,460 --> 01:09:34,293
but I want to ask you one final thing 
and I think it's sort of been a through 

1570
01:09:36,401 --> 01:09:39,340
line to what you're talking about.
I sent sort of like an alternate,

1571
01:09:39,350 --> 01:09:40,183
so there's sort of a world weariness to 
you and then also like a total sense of 

1572
01:09:44,201 --> 01:09:47,770
opportunity.
Do you think these things are in like 50

1573
01:09:47,771 --> 01:09:49,630
slash 50 with you?
Because I have a lot of that too.

1574
01:09:49,631 --> 01:09:51,320
I am definitely world.
We,

1575
01:09:51,340 --> 01:09:52,173
I worry about the state of the world,
what is going to haPpen to the western 

1576
01:09:56,381 --> 01:09:57,214
world and society and all these trends 
that I talked about that I think are so 

1577
01:09:59,861 --> 01:10:03,610
dangerous and yet I could never do this 
if I didn't have optimism and care about

1578
01:10:03,611 --> 01:10:04,444
the ideas.
So I sensed that constantly embattled 

1579
01:10:06,101 --> 01:10:07,990
how,
where are your percentages?

1580
01:10:07,991 --> 01:10:10,510
Where do you get all that to get out of 
bed and do what you do?

1581
01:10:10,570 --> 01:10:12,270
So,
uh,

1582
01:10:12,460 --> 01:10:13,293
people are wealthier than ever before.
There iS less poverty in the world than 

1583
01:10:16,481 --> 01:10:17,314
ever before.
And so I'm very optimistic about that 

1584
01:10:21,520 --> 01:10:24,430
going forward.
I constantly worry about war.

1585
01:10:24,640 --> 01:10:25,570
I do.
I mean,

1586
01:10:25,571 --> 01:10:27,730
you know,
world war two was not that long ago.

1587
01:10:27,790 --> 01:10:31,630
Vietnam wasn't that long ago.
Millions of people died in that war that

1588
01:10:31,631 --> 01:10:33,640
could happen literally at any minute,
you know,

1589
01:10:33,641 --> 01:10:34,474
thinking about the middle east and these
new coalitions that are forming right 

1590
01:10:36,521 --> 01:10:37,354
now and we have the saudi,
the sunni side with the saudis and the 

1591
01:10:39,911 --> 01:10:44,911
us and Israel against the shia side with
Iran and Syria and Russia.

1592
01:10:45,580 --> 01:10:48,340
And if Turkey makes his decision to go 
with the,

1593
01:10:48,480 --> 01:10:49,313
with the shia,
which it very well might because of the 

1594
01:10:50,381 --> 01:10:52,720
kurds.
Then look what we have there.

1595
01:10:52,780 --> 01:10:56,950
We have two huge military alliances 
potentially fighting each other.

1596
01:10:56,951 --> 01:10:59,830
That's terrifying to me.
So I'm always worried about war.

1597
01:10:59,831 --> 01:11:02,770
I always will be so long as there are 
militaries and there probably will be,

1598
01:11:03,310 --> 01:11:04,780
but so I'm split.
I don't know what to say.

1599
01:11:05,960 --> 01:11:07,630
You know what?
I'm okay with anything a show on.

1600
01:11:07,640 --> 01:11:08,473
I don't know if I can say that's the 
difference between this show and most 

1601
01:11:11,211 --> 01:11:14,010
other shows as long as your organic way.
Very okay.

1602
01:11:14,160 --> 01:11:14,971
Alright.
Very good.

1603
01:11:14,971 --> 01:11:15,751
Well,
for more of that,

1604
01:11:15,751 --> 01:11:16,584
he has checked him out on the twitter,
although he's not on the twitter that 

1605
01:11:18,721 --> 01:11:20,670
much,
but he'll Jump on for you.

1606
01:11:20,820 --> 01:11:23,370
It's at patty,
it's russell and thanks for watching.

1607
01:11:23,410 --> 01:11:24,243
We'll do it again next week.
