1
00:00:05,150 --> 00:00:05,983
It's presidents week here on the Rubin 
report and we're partnering with learn 

2
00:00:08,431 --> 00:00:09,264
liberty to bring you five shows in five 
days each highlighting a different 

3
00:00:12,301 --> 00:00:13,134
president of the United States.
Joining me today is an associate 

4
00:00:15,811 --> 00:00:16,644
professor of history at Sam Houston 
state and the Co author of JFK and the 

5
00:00:21,810 --> 00:00:24,900
Reagan Revolution,
a secret history of American prosperity.

6
00:00:25,230 --> 00:00:26,070
Brian,
to be attributed.

7
00:00:26,370 --> 00:00:27,203
Welcome to the Rubin report.
It's great to bear to Mitrovich 

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,110
Demetrihevic.
Usually I say it with a hard state.

9
00:00:31,111 --> 00:00:32,870
Demetrihevic Demetrihevic.
Okay.

10
00:00:32,871 --> 00:00:37,230
I was a big fan of draws in Petrovich 
who was a basketball player from Croatia

11
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:40,230
and the in the early nineties,
but some people said Petro Vic,

12
00:00:40,430 --> 00:00:42,020
and I could never tell rudy.
Tom.

13
00:00:42,021 --> 00:00:43,460
Johnny bench the old coach.
Yeah.

14
00:00:43,461 --> 00:00:45,190
That's properly hot.
Check at the city,

15
00:00:45,191 --> 00:00:47,010
so I'm heretical.
Rudy Times daughters.

16
00:00:47,011 --> 00:00:47,844
That 95 Houston Rockets.
Steam is my favorite basketball team of 

17
00:00:49,831 --> 00:00:52,270
all time.
Clyde Drexler right there.

18
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:54,570
There you go.
As a Houston guy that has.

19
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,460
That has meaning to you.
All right.

20
00:00:56,461 --> 00:01:00,480
I could talk basketball the entire time,
but let's talk president by the title of

21
00:01:00,481 --> 00:01:02,940
your book.
We could probably talk about Reagan just

22
00:01:02,941 --> 00:01:04,920
as easily as we could.
Talk about JFK,

23
00:01:04,921 --> 00:01:06,850
who we're going to talk about.
Um,

24
00:01:07,020 --> 00:01:07,853
do you have a,
do you have a preference out of those 

25
00:01:08,671 --> 00:01:09,240
two?

26
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:10,073
Well,
our book JFK in the Reagan Revolution 

27
00:01:11,251 --> 00:01:12,084
really is two thirds,
three quarters about John F Kennedy 

28
00:01:13,951 --> 00:01:14,784
because we've forgotten that John F 
Kennedy paved the way for the Reagan 

29
00:01:16,951 --> 00:01:17,900
revolution and this big

30
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:19,210
tax cut.
Alright,

31
00:01:19,220 --> 00:01:22,190
so jfk,
since he spent two thirds of it on JFK,

32
00:01:22,191 --> 00:01:23,690
that's the guy we're going to talk 
about.

33
00:01:23,750 --> 00:01:24,583
Um,
I find with JFK that what it seems that 

34
00:01:27,921 --> 00:01:29,680
most,
at least younger people know,

35
00:01:29,690 --> 00:01:32,420
say under 45 ish,
50 ish,

36
00:01:32,421 --> 00:01:34,970
something like that.
They know a lot about the assassination.

37
00:01:34,971 --> 00:01:35,804
You know,
history channel runs the documentaries 

38
00:01:37,191 --> 00:01:38,270
all the time.
You can watch the movie,

39
00:01:38,271 --> 00:01:40,310
JFK,
a zillion other,

40
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:42,110
uh,
things that are out there,

41
00:01:42,380 --> 00:01:44,920
but there's obviously a lot more to jfk 
than,

42
00:01:44,950 --> 00:01:47,030
than just the unfortunate ending.
So let's,

43
00:01:47,060 --> 00:01:47,893
let's start at the beginning.
What do we need to know about early 

44
00:01:50,421 --> 00:01:52,970
childhood,
the Kennedy family,

45
00:01:52,971 --> 00:01:53,510
et Cetera?
Terry,

46
00:01:53,510 --> 00:01:54,350
let's start with childhood.

47
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:55,210
Sure.
It'll.

48
00:01:55,210 --> 00:01:59,410
John F Kennedy was born in May of 1917 
in a very,

49
00:01:59,411 --> 00:02:00,760
uh,
important family,

50
00:02:00,761 --> 00:02:04,090
a family that was becoming one of the 
richest in the United States.

51
00:02:04,091 --> 00:02:05,470
His father,
Joseph p Dot Kennedy,

52
00:02:05,471 --> 00:02:06,304
at that point in the teens that 
graduated from Harvard about 10 years 

53
00:02:08,651 --> 00:02:09,484
before,
was building his fortune would within 

54
00:02:12,940 --> 00:02:16,330
Kennedy's a young childhood before he 
turned 15.

55
00:02:16,730 --> 00:02:20,080
I'm his father had become one of the 
richest men in the country.

56
00:02:20,081 --> 00:02:20,914
And actually just a peak.
Kennedy made most of his money in what 

57
00:02:23,531 --> 00:02:24,364
we call the great contraction,
the worst period of American economic 

58
00:02:26,921 --> 00:02:30,550
history from 1929 to 1933 when he short 
sold the market.

59
00:02:30,910 --> 00:02:32,860
And that's really when the Kennedy's 
became,

60
00:02:32,861 --> 00:02:33,694
uh,
the one of the top richest families in 

61
00:02:34,721 --> 00:02:35,554
the United States.

62
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:38,320
So how political was the Kennedy family 
at that time?

63
00:02:38,710 --> 00:02:39,101
Yeah,
I mean,

64
00:02:39,101 --> 00:02:41,200
it was pretty political.
Joseph p Dot Kennedy.

65
00:02:41,201 --> 00:02:42,034
John F Kennedy's father had married the 
daughter of an important Boston 

66
00:02:44,621 --> 00:02:45,454
politician.
And then Joseph p was not involved in 

67
00:02:48,101 --> 00:02:48,934
politics until FDR.
Franklin Roosevelt appointed him the 

68
00:02:50,981 --> 00:02:53,890
first head of the Securities and 
Exchange Commission in 1934.

69
00:02:54,310 --> 00:02:57,100
And then he became a big Roosevelt 
Democrat.

70
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:59,950
So that was the sort of beginning of

71
00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:03,350
the dynasty in the Kennedy name.
Yes.

72
00:03:03,380 --> 00:03:04,213
Yeah.
So Jfk then tell me a little bit about 

73
00:03:06,371 --> 00:03:07,204
sort of his evolution from a young 
person to starting to become a 

74
00:03:10,361 --> 00:03:11,194
politician.
Yeah.

75
00:03:11,310 --> 00:03:12,143
So John Jfk was the second son,
so there was the Joseph Kennedy junior 

76
00:03:17,651 --> 00:03:18,484
who would be killed in World War II and 
he wasn't a good student in prep school 

77
00:03:23,021 --> 00:03:25,680
and he went to Princeton actually for a 
semester.

78
00:03:25,681 --> 00:03:27,400
It didn't do well there.
Then went to Harvard,

79
00:03:27,401 --> 00:03:29,680
did not do particularly well until his 
senior year,

80
00:03:30,010 --> 00:03:33,640
probably plagiarized his thesis,
which then somehow sold 80,000

81
00:03:33,641 --> 00:03:35,440
competence as a book when it was 
published.

82
00:03:35,441 --> 00:03:37,300
But with his father's help.
Really.

83
00:03:37,310 --> 00:03:38,143
Wait,
are you telling me a little more about 

84
00:03:38,531 --> 00:03:39,670
that?
I haven't heard that one.

85
00:03:39,671 --> 00:03:40,271
Oh yeah,
yeah,

86
00:03:40,271 --> 00:03:41,410
yeah.
So,

87
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:42,820
uh,
John F Kennedy,

88
00:03:43,170 --> 00:03:45,550
uh,
his father in 1938,

89
00:03:45,551 --> 00:03:46,384
39.
I guess this would have been at that 

90
00:03:47,681 --> 00:03:49,540
point was the ambassador to the court of
St James.

91
00:03:49,540 --> 00:03:50,373
So it was the US ambassador to Great 
Britain and was very interested in the 

92
00:03:54,580 --> 00:03:55,413
United States fighting the Soviet Union 
and not necessarily fighting Nazi 

93
00:03:58,270 --> 00:03:59,020
Germany.
Uh,

94
00:03:59,020 --> 00:04:03,400
and so that kind of caused diplomatic 
problems with FDR foreign policy,

95
00:04:03,730 --> 00:04:07,630
but JFK had extraordinary access to the 
files.

96
00:04:07,810 --> 00:04:08,643
And so he wrote a thesis that was 
probably substantially ghost written 

97
00:04:12,670 --> 00:04:15,780
about how England was dealing with the 
Germany credits and then,

98
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:19,660
and then it was published as a book and 
it sold about 80,000

99
00:04:19,661 --> 00:04:20,740
copies.
Of course,

100
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:23,360
Kennedy would publish another book,
profiles in courage and Joseph,

101
00:04:23,361 --> 00:04:24,900
he would pull string.
So at one of the Pulitzer,

102
00:04:26,190 --> 00:04:29,140
it's good to come from a family.
It is pretty good.

103
00:04:29,350 --> 00:04:30,183
Uh,
so tell me a little bit more about how 

104
00:04:30,911 --> 00:04:33,600
he then decided to get into about in 
development.

105
00:04:33,601 --> 00:04:34,040
Yeah.
Well,

106
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:34,873
I,
the decisive event really was the death 

107
00:04:36,971 --> 00:04:40,330
of his brother in 1944.
Joseph Kennedy Jr,

108
00:04:40,470 --> 00:04:41,303
uh,
killed in World War II because really 

109
00:04:43,180 --> 00:04:45,310
all the hopes were on,
on this son.

110
00:04:45,610 --> 00:04:47,740
And he apparently was a very impressive 
guy.

111
00:04:47,741 --> 00:04:50,260
If you look at old pictures of the sun,
Joe,

112
00:04:51,070 --> 00:04:54,250
he was even way better looking than JFK.
He was kind of bigger.

113
00:04:54,251 --> 00:04:56,460
JFK was always kind of skinny,
uh,

114
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:57,333
and it really devastated the father when
he was killed in the war and they 

115
00:05:00,071 --> 00:05:00,671
realize,
Oh boy,

116
00:05:00,671 --> 00:05:01,504
Jack is going to be the one where we're 
going to have all these political hope 

117
00:05:03,351 --> 00:05:04,184
son.
And the father did not have high hopes 

118
00:05:05,351 --> 00:05:08,230
for Ted at that point to Robert Robert,
maybe a.

119
00:05:08,231 --> 00:05:09,640
But right after Kennedy got out of the 
war,

120
00:05:09,641 --> 00:05:11,860
of course he had his distinguished 
career too.

121
00:05:11,890 --> 00:05:15,100
He ran for Congress in 1946.
His father pulled a lot of strengths and

122
00:05:15,101 --> 00:05:18,220
he won a seat in Brookline,
Massachusetts teams in the US House.

123
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:19,233
What does Paul a lot of strings mean 
because I just find the dynasty part of 

124
00:05:21,761 --> 00:05:22,594
this fascinating.
The idea that they're sort of moving 

125
00:05:23,951 --> 00:05:24,784
children,
that the power elite can sort of help 

126
00:05:26,981 --> 00:05:29,110
people get into play here.

127
00:05:29,140 --> 00:05:31,750
Well,
pull out a strings in the 1946 election,

128
00:05:31,751 --> 00:05:33,850
for example.
So on the ballot,

129
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:36,520
Kennedy was running against a particular
opponents.

130
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:38,193
His father found somebody else with the 
exact same name and put that guy's name 

131
00:05:42,641 --> 00:05:46,660
on the ballot and then had a whole 
publicity campaign for that guy's name.

132
00:05:46,661 --> 00:05:48,290
I forget the exact name,
uh,

133
00:05:48,700 --> 00:05:51,850
to be voted for so that,
that would split the vote.

134
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,090
That takes a lot of money and a lot of 
kind of,

135
00:05:55,091 --> 00:05:57,500
um,
a naked ambition.

136
00:05:57,620 --> 00:05:59,910
So that's an example of the kind of 
hardball,

137
00:05:59,990 --> 00:06:03,020
but he felt pled.
So that's a slight sidebar when you hear

138
00:06:03,021 --> 00:06:06,680
about all the craziness involved in 
politics these days and everyone.

139
00:06:06,681 --> 00:06:07,514
No,
it's never been worse and listened to 

140
00:06:08,211 --> 00:06:09,044
the way people talk and all that.
It's like a lot of shady stuff has been 

141
00:06:11,811 --> 00:06:13,020
going on for a long time.
Well,

142
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:15,620
I have no idea how we could look at,
say,

143
00:06:15,621 --> 00:06:16,454
the McCarthy era,
both how mccarthy was treated and how 

144
00:06:19,310 --> 00:06:20,143
mccarthy treated others and say that 
politics was warm and fuzzy back in the 

145
00:06:23,541 --> 00:06:24,380
forties and the fifties.

146
00:06:24,380 --> 00:06:26,080
I have no idea how we could say that.
Yeah.

147
00:06:26,330 --> 00:06:27,163
So did JFK,
do you think he had a presidential 

148
00:06:29,271 --> 00:06:30,104
aspirations then when he started this?
This was sort of thrust on him and he 

149
00:06:33,421 --> 00:06:36,350
and he became a congressman.
But was he already thinking about that,

150
00:06:36,351 --> 00:06:36,890
do you think?
I,

151
00:06:36,890 --> 00:06:39,810
I think so in that,
um,

152
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:40,753
it was well understood that,
that Joe Jr was going to be something 

153
00:06:44,331 --> 00:06:45,164
like president of the United States.
And so when that could not happen after 

154
00:06:48,831 --> 00:06:50,090
his death,
I think it'd be,

155
00:06:50,091 --> 00:06:52,580
became pretty clear to the sons.
Uh,

156
00:06:52,581 --> 00:06:53,414
so there was still jack,
Robert and teddy left and then I think 

157
00:06:55,971 --> 00:06:59,420
six girls that they had to take,
take that place.

158
00:06:59,421 --> 00:07:01,380
And so when he ran for Congress,
yeah,

159
00:07:01,510 --> 00:07:05,090
I mean it was to go onward and upward.
So he was a congressman.

160
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:07,610
How many years was he a congressman?
Right up until he ran from.

161
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:10,890
He was a US representative from 
Brooklyn,

162
00:07:10,891 --> 00:07:11,724
Massachusetts from from 46 to 52.
And then he won a US Senate seat in 

163
00:07:14,871 --> 00:07:15,704
Massachusetts,
bucking the eisenhower a trend because 

164
00:07:19,131 --> 00:07:19,964
he ran on the democratic side.
So he was one of the few democratic 

165
00:07:21,411 --> 00:07:24,830
victories in the 1952 elections.
So then he was a senator for eight years

166
00:07:24,831 --> 00:07:26,140
before he became president.
Yeah.

167
00:07:26,210 --> 00:07:28,640
Did he have any major accomplishments as
a senator?

168
00:07:28,670 --> 00:07:29,503
Well,
that's the interesting thing because 

169
00:07:31,401 --> 00:07:34,820
when we asked what were his major 
accomplishments as president,

170
00:07:34,850 --> 00:07:38,590
let's say legislatively really comes 
down to maybe one or two,

171
00:07:38,660 --> 00:07:39,493
the tax cut in the civil rights act,
so there's not a lot of major 

172
00:07:43,791 --> 00:07:46,310
accomplishments and the whole Kennedy 
biography.

173
00:07:47,030 --> 00:07:52,030
The funny thing about his career as a 
legislator in the Senate in particular,

174
00:07:52,220 --> 00:07:55,370
this is big enthusiasms for two things.
Number one,

175
00:07:55,371 --> 00:07:56,204
he was going after the mob,
which then his son route his brother 

176
00:07:59,451 --> 00:08:00,284
Robert would be big on and number two is
an anti communist in foreign policy and 

177
00:08:04,780 --> 00:08:06,890
that that's how we distinguish himself 
as a senator.

178
00:08:07,130 --> 00:08:07,963
Yeah,
so it's interesting that the 

179
00:08:08,871 --> 00:08:12,530
anticommunist part is interesting 
because the parties have shifted so much

180
00:08:12,531 --> 00:08:17,150
these days that I'm not saying the left 
or the Democrats are communists now,

181
00:08:17,151 --> 00:08:20,990
but that voice,
that sort of anti socialism,

182
00:08:20,991 --> 00:08:25,130
communism voice would rarely be heard of
from the lottery left,

183
00:08:25,131 --> 00:08:26,870
which does tell you how these things 
have shifted.

184
00:08:26,980 --> 00:08:27,813
Joseph p dot Kennedy,
his father became persona non grata in 

185
00:08:30,741 --> 00:08:31,730
the U.
S government,

186
00:08:31,790 --> 00:08:33,620
when in 1938,
39,

187
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:34,633
he told Franklin,
d dot Roosevelt from his high position 

188
00:08:36,351 --> 00:08:37,184
as ambassador in Great Britain.
We don't have to worry about the Nazis 

189
00:08:39,701 --> 00:08:41,960
so much.
We have to worry about communism because

190
00:08:41,961 --> 00:08:44,720
communism can overthrow the American way
of life.

191
00:08:44,990 --> 00:08:45,823
I think there's a pretty direct link 
there to what his son was doing in the 

192
00:08:48,201 --> 00:08:49,820
fifties and sixties.
That's interesting.

193
00:08:49,821 --> 00:08:53,030
So he was,
he viewed it as Nazi-ism was an external

194
00:08:53,031 --> 00:08:54,320
threat,
not within our borders,

195
00:08:54,321 --> 00:08:56,340
but communism actually with something 
that could come from.

196
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:57,300
That was joe's feeling.
Yeah.

197
00:08:57,390 --> 00:08:59,820
Yeah.
It was Kinda Kinda prophetic.

198
00:08:59,900 --> 00:09:02,540
And he was a new dealer and all that.
You said,

199
00:09:02,550 --> 00:09:03,181
well,
new deal.

200
00:09:03,181 --> 00:09:06,270
The new deal can help save capitalism.
That was an erroneous argument.

201
00:09:06,271 --> 00:09:07,104
But,
but Joseph p dot Kennedy was worried 

202
00:09:08,850 --> 00:09:13,110
about the onslaughts against capitalism.
Communism.

203
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:14,110
Yeah.
Interesting.

204
00:09:14,111 --> 00:09:18,740
So it sounds like the Senate career was 
sort of less than spectacular.

205
00:09:18,850 --> 00:09:20,710
It doesn't sound like anything major 
happened.

206
00:09:21,180 --> 00:09:22,890
Kennedy was pretty careful.
Uh,

207
00:09:22,910 --> 00:09:25,710
he,
he began his Senate career,

208
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:26,633
uh,
ailing.

209
00:09:26,850 --> 00:09:30,000
He had back surgery in 1953.
As soon as he became a senator and could

210
00:09:30,001 --> 00:09:33,150
not attend the Senate,
he was in fact had to be reclined,

211
00:09:33,470 --> 00:09:34,303
uh,
for a very long time because his back 

212
00:09:35,731 --> 00:09:39,390
injury and that's when he decided to 
write profiles and courage,

213
00:09:39,420 --> 00:09:44,420
his 1956 book,
1955 when the Pulitzer in 1956 about the

214
00:09:44,431 --> 00:09:48,390
greats of the Senate over time.
So because he was incapacitated,

215
00:09:48,391 --> 00:09:49,224
he wanted to show he was still doing 
senate work by writing about Senate 

216
00:09:51,721 --> 00:09:52,160
history.

217
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:52,993
Right?
Yeah.

218
00:09:53,110 --> 00:09:53,943
God,
what a beautiful thing to be in 

219
00:09:54,491 --> 00:09:56,200
government.
You don't really have to do anything and

220
00:09:56,201 --> 00:09:58,270
you could write about the other guys 
that did some stuff.

221
00:09:58,271 --> 00:09:59,320
It's,
it's an incredible thing.

222
00:09:59,740 --> 00:10:00,573
Nineteen 60,
he becomes president and he defeats 

223
00:10:02,741 --> 00:10:05,080
Richard Nixon who was vice president at 
the time.

224
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:08,680
I think the one thing that people really
remember is that debate.

225
00:10:08,970 --> 00:10:09,803
Oh yeah.
Because he was sort of this young good 

226
00:10:11,771 --> 00:10:13,930
looking guy and there was Nixon 
sweating.

227
00:10:13,931 --> 00:10:15,670
Is there anything else we have to 
remember from,

228
00:10:15,820 --> 00:10:16,550
from that election?

229
00:10:16,550 --> 00:10:17,310
So yeah,
that.

230
00:10:17,310 --> 00:10:19,370
So I,
there was debate in September 19,

231
00:10:19,371 --> 00:10:24,371
60 and people always say that Nixon won 
on the radio and lost on televisions,

232
00:10:24,621 --> 00:10:27,950
that if people just heard his words or 
even read the transcript,

233
00:10:28,190 --> 00:10:31,010
that he defeated Kennedy.
But if you looked on the television,

234
00:10:31,011 --> 00:10:32,900
there's black and white television and 
lots of viewers.

235
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:36,380
A Kennedy was the youthful,
a bronze,

236
00:10:36,590 --> 00:10:38,540
which is probably from his Addison 
Syndrome,

237
00:10:38,570 --> 00:10:41,930
not the Suntan,
a hero in Nixon looked like a schlub.

238
00:10:42,350 --> 00:10:43,370
Uhm,
I dunno

239
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:46,280
because it was in black and white,
but it's still even having.

240
00:10:46,281 --> 00:10:47,114
Okay.

241
00:10:47,170 --> 00:10:48,070
Still helps.
And again,

242
00:10:48,071 --> 00:10:48,904
that was from one of his ailments.
I mean that wasn't from the South 

243
00:10:51,550 --> 00:10:53,670
Pacific.
So I dunno,

244
00:10:53,710 --> 00:10:56,050
I've read those transcripts and I think 
Kennedy clearly won.

245
00:10:56,310 --> 00:10:58,330
I mean Nixon was saying things like,
oh,

246
00:10:58,331 --> 00:10:59,980
there's been great economic growth in 
this country.

247
00:10:59,981 --> 00:11:01,390
We're tipping into a recession,
right?

248
00:11:01,391 --> 00:11:02,470
Then 400,000
people.

249
00:11:02,471 --> 00:11:04,540
We're about to lose their jobs in the 
month of October.

250
00:11:04,750 --> 00:11:05,680
And Nixon was saying,
oh,

251
00:11:05,681 --> 00:11:06,514
we've had the greatest economic growth 
with that we've ever had under 

252
00:11:08,261 --> 00:11:10,810
Eisenhower.
Been three recessions under Eisenhower.

253
00:11:11,020 --> 00:11:11,853
Now.
I think Nixon lost that debate on the 

254
00:11:12,851 --> 00:11:13,720
transcript as well.

255
00:11:13,870 --> 00:11:14,703
Interesting.
So just to get a sense of how parties 

256
00:11:16,961 --> 00:11:17,980
have changed,
what was the,

257
00:11:18,010 --> 00:11:21,460
what were the basic tenants that a jfk 
was running on?

258
00:11:21,570 --> 00:11:22,403
Yup.
So John F Kennedy didn't know what he 

259
00:11:25,231 --> 00:11:28,380
wanted to run on a.
This is a classic Kennedy thing.

260
00:11:28,381 --> 00:11:32,520
We know we must be president.
So the question is what are we to run?

261
00:11:32,521 --> 00:11:33,310
Uh,
uh,

262
00:11:33,310 --> 00:11:34,143
so,
uh,

263
00:11:34,170 --> 00:11:36,220
it was really the Democratic National 
Committee or the,

264
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:37,153
the,
the convention that summer that kind of 

265
00:11:38,851 --> 00:11:41,730
defined for Kennedy.
He had a lot to do with it of course,

266
00:11:41,900 --> 00:11:43,950
at what the,
what he would run on.

267
00:11:43,980 --> 00:11:44,813
And he decided he would run the on,
that the country was not growing enough 

268
00:11:47,790 --> 00:11:48,623
and he made his tagline,
we have to get this country moving 

269
00:11:50,431 --> 00:11:51,264
again.
We have all these old slow people in 

270
00:11:53,141 --> 00:11:57,330
government and he kept making the point 
that we have a lot of recession.

271
00:11:57,331 --> 00:11:58,400
So it was right.
There was a recession,

272
00:11:58,420 --> 00:12:03,420
1954 big one in 1957 and then it was 
coming right then in 1960 and he said we

273
00:12:04,241 --> 00:12:05,074
got to get out of this Rut,
and he kept saying we have to get this 

274
00:12:06,491 --> 00:12:08,380
country moving again,
get this country moving again.

275
00:12:08,380 --> 00:12:09,213
So that was his main thing.
And then he also talked about after we 

276
00:12:11,410 --> 00:12:12,243
helped,
we have to get a little tougher on 

277
00:12:12,731 --> 00:12:14,470
communism because we're not moving 
enough.

278
00:12:14,471 --> 00:12:17,560
The Soviets are starting to pass us by 
and those were his big themes.

279
00:12:18,100 --> 00:12:20,560
So when you say that within a 20,
18 context,

280
00:12:20,561 --> 00:12:22,450
it's hard to believe,
as I referenced earlier,

281
00:12:22,451 --> 00:12:26,470
it's hard to believe that a Democrat 
would be running against sort of slow,

282
00:12:26,830 --> 00:12:30,190
inefficient government,
but that is what he did.

283
00:12:30,191 --> 00:12:31,410
It's kind of incredible.
Yeah.

284
00:12:31,660 --> 00:12:36,660
Now the Republicans back then were the 
big deficit hawks there are like,

285
00:12:37,060 --> 00:12:39,490
okay,
maybe we've had some recessions,

286
00:12:39,491 --> 00:12:40,324
but we have a budget deficit.
Then we have to keep taxes high tax 

287
00:12:42,911 --> 00:12:45,220
rates high,
so we take care of the budget deficit.

288
00:12:45,250 --> 00:12:47,710
Wouldn't be prudent or that'll George 
Bush line.

289
00:12:47,740 --> 00:12:48,573
I mean that's very applicable.
George Bush came of age in the 19 

290
00:12:50,471 --> 00:12:54,370
fifties to have economic growth if we 
don't take care of our deficit first.

291
00:12:54,370 --> 00:12:57,600
And that was the defensive position.
Avantis and Howard and Nixon.

292
00:12:58,120 --> 00:13:00,250
Kennedy saw that and saw an opening and 
ran with it.

293
00:13:00,370 --> 00:13:01,203
Yeah.
So what was the beginning of the 

294
00:13:03,190 --> 00:13:06,130
presidency like when I watch all of 
these documentaries now,

295
00:13:06,370 --> 00:13:07,203
you know,
they talk so much about the family and 

296
00:13:08,771 --> 00:13:09,604
that there was this feeling of this 
young person in the office and all of 

297
00:13:12,280 --> 00:13:14,170
that.
I suspect there was more to it than just

298
00:13:14,171 --> 00:13:15,110
that.
Okay.

299
00:13:15,111 --> 00:13:17,650
So when Kennedy was elected in November 
19,

300
00:13:17,651 --> 00:13:18,484
60,
the United States that just tipped into 

301
00:13:19,721 --> 00:13:20,554
a recession and there were mass layoffs 
and hundreds of thousands in October 

302
00:13:23,441 --> 00:13:27,790
probably delivered in the election when 
that Sorenson has advised with certainly

303
00:13:27,791 --> 00:13:28,624
thought.
So and then unemployment went all the 

304
00:13:29,861 --> 00:13:30,694
way up,
increased up to $5 million by night by 

305
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:34,660
January 1961.
So when you kind of,

306
00:13:34,661 --> 00:13:35,494
you know what that percentage was just 
for reference to five percent now it 

307
00:13:38,970 --> 00:13:39,820
doesn't sound like that.

308
00:13:39,820 --> 00:13:42,550
What will 5 million,
5 million the workforce,

309
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:43,593
the unemployment rate was probably going
up to about eight percent at that point 

310
00:13:47,891 --> 00:13:49,270
I'd have to check,
but probably around there.

311
00:13:49,790 --> 00:13:52,210
Um,
so Kennedy took office,

312
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:54,120
submits a snow storm of,
right.

313
00:13:54,130 --> 00:13:56,530
That just ended it before his inaugural 
address,

314
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:57,393
famous inaugural address.
And the big problem was there's now a 

315
00:14:01,811 --> 00:14:06,340
new recession and then when he gave his 
State of the Union address 10 days later

316
00:14:06,550 --> 00:14:08,720
in January of 1961,
um,

317
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:14,020
he kind of had a lot of kind of 
equivalence equivocal statements.

318
00:14:14,021 --> 00:14:16,640
He said we have to get our house in 
order.

319
00:14:16,641 --> 00:14:18,460
We have yet our country moving again and
we have,

320
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:20,380
the government has to spend a lot of 
money.

321
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:21,753
So we kind of laid out two options.
We have to kind of get the government 

322
00:14:24,101 --> 00:14:26,470
more efficient but also get the 
government spending a lot of money.

323
00:14:26,471 --> 00:14:28,660
So it was unclear what he was going to 
do.

324
00:14:28,900 --> 00:14:30,760
Yeah.
What does that even mean?

325
00:14:30,761 --> 00:14:32,410
I mean,
do you think he knew at the time because

326
00:14:32,411 --> 00:14:35,260
those sound like statements that can't 
work together.

327
00:14:35,890 --> 00:14:38,080
Richard Reeves,
who's his greatest biographer,

328
00:14:38,180 --> 00:14:40,150
he wrote the great book on Kennedy in 
Nineteen Ninety two.

329
00:14:40,270 --> 00:14:42,190
President Kennedy.
He said,

330
00:14:42,191 --> 00:14:42,390
no,
no,

331
00:14:42,390 --> 00:14:43,990
no.
What Kennedy liked to do,

332
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:46,690
and I think this is true,
we have all the Kennedy tapes.

333
00:14:46,691 --> 00:14:47,524
We can hear him on audio that John F 
Kennedy Library has an amazing things 

334
00:14:51,050 --> 00:14:54,080
online.
We can hear so much from Kennedy's voice

335
00:14:54,081 --> 00:14:54,914
privately.
It's pretty clear that he thought 

336
00:14:57,111 --> 00:15:02,111
himself kind of the Uber intellectual.
I'm not a philosophical intellectual,

337
00:15:03,051 --> 00:15:03,884
but somebody who could process thoughts 
and he would get a lot of good advice 

338
00:15:07,130 --> 00:15:09,920
and then pick the best option.
So that's the way he would operate.

339
00:15:09,921 --> 00:15:10,754
He wasn't gonna figure it out himself.
He was going to wait and see and then 

340
00:15:13,431 --> 00:15:14,540
make a strategic decision.

341
00:15:14,570 --> 00:15:15,403
So you think when he brought up those 
seemingly conflicting ideas that he 

342
00:15:17,541 --> 00:15:20,060
actually did mean it and that eventually
you could pick one.

343
00:15:20,061 --> 00:15:22,880
You would whittle it away with the right
people behind it.

344
00:15:23,090 --> 00:15:25,370
And now this sort of gets to what your 
book was about.

345
00:15:25,371 --> 00:15:28,780
Which one did he end up going for?
It was this good.

346
00:15:29,150 --> 00:15:31,040
He went for both.
Okay.

347
00:15:31,041 --> 00:15:33,860
So Larry Kudlow and I wrote this book a 
Jeff Can,

348
00:15:33,861 --> 00:15:35,960
the Reagan Revolution about the John F 
Kennedy tax cut.

349
00:15:35,961 --> 00:15:36,794
And the big reason is what Larry,
my co author has had to deal with for 

350
00:15:40,221 --> 00:15:41,420
15,
20 years.

351
00:15:41,870 --> 00:15:45,230
He gets this at parties from the likes 
of people like Caroline Kennedy.

352
00:15:45,231 --> 00:15:47,780
Uh,
he gets it on television and CNBC.

353
00:15:48,170 --> 00:15:49,003
How dare you say that?
The John F Kennedy tax cut had anything 

354
00:15:51,441 --> 00:15:52,274
to do with the ragging tax cut because 
that tax cut was designed by Keynesians 

355
00:15:55,610 --> 00:15:58,430
in order to stimulate demand in the 
economy.

356
00:15:59,150 --> 00:16:00,350
And Larry's out.
I don't think so.

357
00:16:00,680 --> 00:16:02,210
And he's right.
All right.

358
00:16:02,211 --> 00:16:03,640
Wait,
let's pause for just a second though.

359
00:16:03,650 --> 00:16:05,870
Can you tell me a little bit about the 
tax cut specifically?

360
00:16:06,030 --> 00:16:07,250
So we have the framework.
Okay.

361
00:16:07,251 --> 00:16:10,910
Yeah.
So there was a tax cut in 1964.

362
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:13,760
So after Kennedy's president of,
after Kennedy died,

363
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:14,953
that was his brainchild and that 
actually was his main legislative 

364
00:16:18,111 --> 00:16:22,100
accomplishment,
but he was president for a thousand days

365
00:16:22,940 --> 00:16:23,773
and he didn't get anything done really 
on the economy until he introduced that 

366
00:16:29,001 --> 00:16:32,600
tax cut in 1963.
So in 61 and 62,

367
00:16:32,630 --> 00:16:36,200
he was doing his famous vacillating.
That's when he was thinking about,

368
00:16:36,201 --> 00:16:36,781
hey,
the canes,

369
00:16:36,781 --> 00:16:40,970
yours is saying we need loose money from
the Federal Reserve and we need a lot of

370
00:16:40,971 --> 00:16:41,804
social programs.
And he was experimenting with that 

371
00:16:45,050 --> 00:16:45,950
forecast.
Came in,

372
00:16:45,951 --> 00:16:48,260
there's going to be another recession.
He pulled back and said,

373
00:16:48,261 --> 00:16:49,670
wait,
we need some more deep thinking.

374
00:16:49,970 --> 00:16:51,170
Keynesian said,
keep doing it.

375
00:16:51,171 --> 00:16:52,610
But then pulled in other people.
What do you say?

376
00:16:52,611 --> 00:16:54,110
No,
we need a big marginal tax cut.

377
00:16:54,650 --> 00:16:55,483
I get it.
When the stock market crashed in April 

378
00:16:56,691 --> 00:16:57,524
19,
62,

379
00:16:57,650 --> 00:16:58,670
June 19,
62,

380
00:16:58,671 --> 00:16:59,504
he said,
okay,

381
00:16:59,510 --> 00:17:00,343
we need a big marginal tax gut.
How powerful was the presidency at this 

382
00:17:03,261 --> 00:17:03,681
time?
You know,

383
00:17:03,681 --> 00:17:04,514
one of the things that we talk about on 
this show a lot is just that the 

384
00:17:06,081 --> 00:17:06,914
executive branch just keeps getting more
power and more power and does all this 

385
00:17:09,501 --> 00:17:11,720
stuff via executive action.
A lot of this,

386
00:17:11,721 --> 00:17:14,030
when you hear about it,
I think the average person thinks,

387
00:17:14,031 --> 00:17:14,864
wait a minute,
is it the president's job really to be 

388
00:17:16,551 --> 00:17:18,080
doing all this?
Is it he's supposed to sign.

389
00:17:18,081 --> 00:17:18,914
The law is not really making the laws,
but it's interesting on that score is 

390
00:17:22,611 --> 00:17:23,444
the John f Kennedy was actually not 
terribly interested in making unique 

391
00:17:27,651 --> 00:17:28,484
executive actions actually with each of 
his executive sign it signing up 

392
00:17:31,900 --> 00:17:32,360
signings.

393
00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:33,193
He had these signing statements that 
went on and on and on about how he 

394
00:17:35,590 --> 00:17:38,700
justified his signature was sometimes.
Now we did.

395
00:17:38,701 --> 00:17:41,240
They just sign it right now.
It's just no know he paddled up.

396
00:17:42,690 --> 00:17:45,130
Signature back.
So good.

397
00:17:45,570 --> 00:17:46,880
I think that's the residence.
Yeah,

398
00:17:47,990 --> 00:17:48,823
so he actually rejected a,
an executive authority that his liberal 

399
00:17:53,251 --> 00:17:54,084
advisors were imploring him to take him 
and that was his liberal advantage and 

400
00:17:58,500 --> 00:18:00,990
say you should have a standby tax cut 
authority.

401
00:18:01,260 --> 00:18:02,093
You should have the authority as 
president just to reduce taxes on your 

402
00:18:04,351 --> 00:18:06,930
own for a period of time,
maybe up to 18 months.

403
00:18:07,170 --> 00:18:09,300
So if the economy starts tipping into 
recession,

404
00:18:09,301 --> 00:18:10,134
you can just sign a piece of paper and 
everyone's taxes will go down and we'll 

405
00:18:12,121 --> 00:18:15,120
get out of recession.
And then if inflation starts going up or

406
00:18:15,121 --> 00:18:18,150
overheating then you can take it away 
and that's effective.

407
00:18:18,510 --> 00:18:19,650
And Kennedy said,
no,

408
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:22,410
I'm not going to do that.
That's interesting.

409
00:18:23,110 --> 00:18:27,340
So I always described Kennedy as my kind
of Democrat.

410
00:18:27,370 --> 00:18:29,620
You know,
I talk a lot about how the left has sort

411
00:18:29,621 --> 00:18:30,454
of lost its way and it's lost its 
classical liberal roots and they've 

412
00:18:33,431 --> 00:18:37,300
picked progressivism,
big government over liberalism.

413
00:18:38,050 --> 00:18:40,120
Do you think his political ethos,
I mean,

414
00:18:40,121 --> 00:18:40,954
from everything I'm hearing from you so 
far was he basically came from a 

415
00:18:43,271 --> 00:18:45,490
classical liberal line of thinking,
right?

416
00:18:45,491 --> 00:18:46,660
Is that,
is that fair to say?

417
00:18:46,730 --> 00:18:47,511
Yeah,
I mean,

418
00:18:47,511 --> 00:18:49,050
Ken Kennedy ultimately

419
00:18:49,070 --> 00:18:51,650
it sounds like there was definitely some
play on both sides.

420
00:18:51,651 --> 00:18:51,820
Yeah.

421
00:18:51,820 --> 00:18:52,653
Yeah.
Kennedy ultimately did some very good 

422
00:18:55,061 --> 00:18:57,250
things as precedent above all the tax 
code.

423
00:18:57,310 --> 00:18:58,143
You could argue the civil rights act 
even though like I still kind of think 

424
00:19:00,551 --> 00:19:01,384
and Kennedy believed,
and we can talk about this later if you 

425
00:19:02,931 --> 00:19:04,660
like,
that if the tax got,

426
00:19:04,661 --> 00:19:08,080
had just happened,
the civil rights,

427
00:19:08,081 --> 00:19:10,090
that would have been unnecessary.
We can talk about that later.

428
00:19:10,870 --> 00:19:13,360
The thing though about Kennedy's,
he was kind of a wild man.

429
00:19:13,450 --> 00:19:17,420
I mean,
he was a rich wildman and um,

430
00:19:18,130 --> 00:19:21,760
I don't know how useful that 
particularly is in our political life.

431
00:19:22,360 --> 00:19:25,510
His father was kind of crazy about what 
he did,

432
00:19:25,540 --> 00:19:26,373
how he felt he could influence politics 
and his son was kind of a chip off the 

433
00:19:30,161 --> 00:19:32,260
old block,
although his son was incapable of making

434
00:19:32,261 --> 00:19:34,470
money unlike his father.
Uh,

435
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:35,333
but they were both pretty wild people in
kind of in charge of the United States 

436
00:19:38,171 --> 00:19:39,004
government.
That might be an argument for shrinking 

437
00:19:39,701 --> 00:19:40,200
government.

438
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:40,811
Yeah.
Well,

439
00:19:40,811 --> 00:19:41,970
all right,
so when you say wild,

440
00:19:41,971 --> 00:19:45,030
I mean we hear all kinds of stories and 
rumors and all this and that.

441
00:19:45,031 --> 00:19:45,620
I mean,
what are you,

442
00:19:45,620 --> 00:19:47,790
what are you saying wild is or was?

443
00:19:47,850 --> 00:19:48,840
Yeah.
Um,

444
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:52,440
we at Larry and I talked a bit about a 
girl.

445
00:19:52,441 --> 00:19:53,274
He dated,
a woman named Margaret [inaudible] who 

446
00:19:55,591 --> 00:19:59,380
won the Pulitzer Prize in biography and 
history sort of biography,

447
00:19:59,381 --> 00:20:01,860
a great biography of John Calhoun,
1950.

448
00:20:01,861 --> 00:20:02,694
And when the pills surprise then Kenny 
wanted to get to network because he 

449
00:20:04,561 --> 00:20:05,970
wanted to win,
appealed surprise too.

450
00:20:06,570 --> 00:20:10,350
And we have her recollections of the 
time when she dated Kennedy right before

451
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:11,513
he,
um,

452
00:20:11,690 --> 00:20:15,000
he proposed to Jackie in 1953 and she 
said,

453
00:20:15,001 --> 00:20:15,834
you know,
he'd just drive around in the convert 

454
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:18,353
convertible and making sure he was 
staying on the street car tracks and 

455
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:24,660
just annoying people on the road.
And he was saying,

456
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:25,880
I want to do this,
I'm going to do this.

457
00:20:25,910 --> 00:20:28,050
I just realized this guy's just a little
bit out of my league.

458
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:32,220
Um,
he was a force of nature.

459
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:34,760
Um,
so all right,

460
00:20:34,770 --> 00:20:36,510
there are some people who are forces of 
nature.

461
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:40,320
So I just think from a certain 
perspective that might be a reason if we

462
00:20:40,321 --> 00:20:41,154
have government to make sure that if we 
have those people at the top of 

463
00:20:43,321 --> 00:20:44,730
government,
government should be small.

464
00:20:46,060 --> 00:20:47,830
All right.
I want to do a lot on the taxes and I do

465
00:20:47,831 --> 00:20:48,010
want to

466
00:20:48,010 --> 00:20:48,843
get to civil rights,
but we should back up a little bit 

467
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:51,340
because I haven't mentioned Jackie at 
all.

468
00:20:51,341 --> 00:20:53,710
I actually just watched the movie with 
Natalie Portman.

469
00:20:54,010 --> 00:20:54,843
I thought it was excellent.
What do we need to know about their 

470
00:20:56,621 --> 00:20:58,090
relationship,
the courtship.

471
00:20:58,091 --> 00:20:59,890
And then the amount of power that she 
had,

472
00:20:59,891 --> 00:21:03,430
or at least the uncomfortability with,
with being the first lady,

473
00:21:03,431 --> 00:21:05,890
and then subsequently after,
after he was assassinated,

474
00:21:06,280 --> 00:21:09,290
Jackie,
I'm the first guy who proposed to Jack.

475
00:21:09,291 --> 00:21:14,290
He just died a year or two ago in his 
home on Nantucket in Massachusetts.

476
00:21:14,350 --> 00:21:18,400
And Jackie turned down his proposal.
This is in 1951 or 52,

477
00:21:18,420 --> 00:21:20,470
uh,
because she and her mother did not think

478
00:21:20,471 --> 00:21:21,304
that he would end up being rich enough 
and I point out that he'd died on 

479
00:21:23,951 --> 00:21:26,680
nantucket.
But I think she was right.

480
00:21:26,740 --> 00:21:28,990
Even he was,
would not have been rich enough.

481
00:21:29,010 --> 00:21:29,550
Well,
um,

482
00:21:29,550 --> 00:21:31,000
no,
I think that Jackie,

483
00:21:31,030 --> 00:21:31,863
and that's hard to believe,
but people don't really understand what 

484
00:21:33,851 --> 00:21:36,060
that sort of northeast,
um,

485
00:21:36,120 --> 00:21:36,910
what,
what do you call that?

486
00:21:36,910 --> 00:21:38,410
It's not even a lead.
It's something else,

487
00:21:38,411 --> 00:21:39,450
right?
Just that,

488
00:21:39,451 --> 00:21:40,284
that family dynasty the thing where 
these people really were connected with 

489
00:21:43,961 --> 00:21:47,260
other people for the purposes of,
of politics and power.

490
00:21:47,261 --> 00:21:48,550
It's hard.
It's hard to believe it.

491
00:21:48,551 --> 00:21:50,640
I think in modern sense.
Um,

492
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:54,670
but I think what really calm Jackie 
down,

493
00:21:54,671 --> 00:21:55,504
they were a great love match.
I don't think there's any dispute about 

494
00:21:57,221 --> 00:21:58,054
that Jack and Jackie,
but what really settled Jackie was 

495
00:22:01,901 --> 00:22:05,650
Joseph piece wealth.
Jackie really adored Jeff Case.

496
00:22:05,651 --> 00:22:08,280
Father adored him.
Um,

497
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:10,780
and his $400,000,000
calmed her down.

498
00:22:11,170 --> 00:22:14,890
So I think that was at the absolute glue
that kept them together.

499
00:22:14,930 --> 00:22:16,870
Right.
And she came from a lot of money,

500
00:22:16,871 --> 00:22:17,704
right?
I mean,

501
00:22:17,710 --> 00:22:19,330
the movie has had money.
Yeah.

502
00:22:19,331 --> 00:22:20,160
They,
uh,

503
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:20,993
then there's a divorce and she was 
married and she had brought into the 

504
00:22:23,471 --> 00:22:25,610
[inaudible] family,
which was very involved.

505
00:22:25,611 --> 00:22:26,444
The senator from New Jersey,
all class representative who voted for 

506
00:22:28,541 --> 00:22:31,080
the Kennedy tax cut in 1960,
19 sixties.

507
00:22:31,350 --> 00:22:33,460
Lewis,
the famous novelist,

508
00:22:33,940 --> 00:22:35,200
um,
but they,

509
00:22:35,250 --> 00:22:36,083
they had been harmed by the 1929 crisis 
and the Kennedy family had been 

510
00:22:40,750 --> 00:22:41,583
immensely enriched by the 1929 crisis.
So there was a big wealth gap between 

511
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:47,680
those families.
So everything that I've seen about,

512
00:22:47,681 --> 00:22:50,860
or I haven't read much about her,
but I've watched grey gardens,

513
00:22:51,450 --> 00:22:52,283
the Jackie Moody and everything that she
really struggled with the public nature 

514
00:22:56,201 --> 00:22:57,034
of this really from day one.
But she also knew what she was marrying 

515
00:22:59,531 --> 00:23:00,364
into.
Is that just a little bit about the 

516
00:23:01,541 --> 00:23:03,610
complexity of her character?
Well,

517
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:05,470
Jackie was this.
No question.

518
00:23:05,471 --> 00:23:06,304
She was a sophisticated person.
I mean she spoke French and Spanish and 

519
00:23:09,851 --> 00:23:14,710
all that because she was interested in 
the ways of the world and she really was

520
00:23:14,711 --> 00:23:18,310
one of the most remarkable fashion 
plates in all of history.

521
00:23:18,760 --> 00:23:21,850
And she stepped into those roles very 
well.

522
00:23:21,851 --> 00:23:24,340
So yes,
she was shy.

523
00:23:24,340 --> 00:23:27,810
She has that little voice that you can 
vary the amount very barely here.

524
00:23:28,280 --> 00:23:29,113
Um,
but she also understood what her 

525
00:23:30,341 --> 00:23:31,174
potential was.
Her potential was to be an ambassador 

526
00:23:33,941 --> 00:23:36,320
for civilization and she stepped into 
that very,

527
00:23:36,350 --> 00:23:37,900
very willingly and it's good that she 
did.

528
00:23:38,290 --> 00:23:39,670
Okay.
So now let's jump back,

529
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:40,513
renew a little more on her,
but then now let's jump back to those 

530
00:23:41,591 --> 00:23:42,424
tax cuts.
So you're saying the JFK put those tax 

531
00:23:44,651 --> 00:23:46,940
cuts into place 62,
63,

532
00:23:46,941 --> 00:23:49,670
but then they weren't enacted until 
after he was gone.

533
00:23:50,150 --> 00:23:53,060
So tell me a little bit more about that.
What happened is they didn't split those

534
00:23:53,061 --> 00:23:54,620
tax cuts in place,
I'm afraid.

535
00:23:54,621 --> 00:23:55,454
And 61 and 62,
he listened to his liberal advisors who 

536
00:23:57,681 --> 00:23:58,514
said,
we have to concentrate on government 

537
00:23:59,391 --> 00:24:01,640
spending,
hold off on tax cuts.

538
00:24:01,730 --> 00:24:03,140
Let's just concentrate on government 
spending.

539
00:24:03,290 --> 00:24:07,610
Let's get loose money from the Fed and 
maybe welfare programs spend on national

540
00:24:07,611 --> 00:24:08,050
parks.

541
00:24:08,050 --> 00:24:11,850
I'd post offices all bunch of stuff and 
that will stave off for session,

542
00:24:11,940 --> 00:24:13,520
that'll stave it off,
that'll stave it off.

543
00:24:13,521 --> 00:24:18,521
And if we invest in education and 
hospitals and Medicare and welfare,

544
00:24:19,100 --> 00:24:22,160
the economy will grow because of that 
government investment.

545
00:24:22,430 --> 00:24:24,620
That was the argument of his liberal 
advisors.

546
00:24:24,621 --> 00:24:27,470
Kennedy did that for the first year and 
a half.

547
00:24:28,130 --> 00:24:29,450
All the forecasts came in and said,
oh,

548
00:24:29,451 --> 00:24:31,430
there's gonna be another recession.
There's been.

549
00:24:31,460 --> 00:24:34,070
There were four recessions.
The 1950 to 1949,

550
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:36,320
50 4:57
60,

551
00:24:36,420 --> 00:24:39,140
let me a fifth and 13 years.
Every 24 months,

552
00:24:39,141 --> 00:24:40,640
36 months,
it's going to be a recession.

553
00:24:41,090 --> 00:24:44,870
When the stock market went down 30 
percent in the spring of 1962,

554
00:24:45,260 --> 00:24:47,690
Kennedy said they made another 
recession.

555
00:24:47,780 --> 00:24:50,060
I am going to be so run out of office.
It's not funny.

556
00:24:50,450 --> 00:24:51,283
We're going to switch gears here and 
that's when he gave his commencement 

557
00:24:53,691 --> 00:24:54,524
speech at Yale in June of 19,
62 saying we have to think about 

558
00:24:57,651 --> 00:24:58,484
reversing our policy mix towards tight 
money to protect the dollar in tax cuts 

559
00:25:02,571 --> 00:25:04,940
to expand the economy,
and then what happened?

560
00:25:04,940 --> 00:25:07,560
What was the result then is liberal 
advisors said,

561
00:25:07,561 --> 00:25:07,780
Whoa,
Whoa,

562
00:25:07,780 --> 00:25:08,361
Whoa,
wait,

563
00:25:08,361 --> 00:25:08,691
wait,
wait,

564
00:25:08,691 --> 00:25:09,710
wait.
It's going great though.

565
00:25:09,711 --> 00:25:11,310
Listen to that.
We're going to do this.

566
00:25:11,560 --> 00:25:12,393
Their argument though,
at that point when they were looking at 

567
00:25:13,461 --> 00:25:14,294
the numbers,
what,

568
00:25:14,360 --> 00:25:15,193
what was the argument was purely like 
operating on a philosophical level and 

569
00:25:18,011 --> 00:25:20,390
then you just keep throwing money at the
government and these programs.

570
00:25:20,391 --> 00:25:22,440
They waves academic articles.
I had,

571
00:25:22,550 --> 00:25:23,383
they had Paul Samuelson at Mit and 
Robert Solow to future Nobel prize 

572
00:25:26,781 --> 00:25:30,110
winners who was a staff and the council 
of economic advisors saying,

573
00:25:30,410 --> 00:25:31,940
Oh no,
we've come up with this thing called the

574
00:25:31,941 --> 00:25:35,840
neoclassical synthesis that says if you 
have really loose money from the Fed,

575
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:39,110
that will get the economy moving.
Don't worry about inflation.

576
00:25:39,111 --> 00:25:39,944
You can mop it up with high tax rates 
and then the revenue you get can fund 

577
00:25:44,360 --> 00:25:48,680
programs in education,
in healthcare that will help the economy

578
00:25:48,681 --> 00:25:49,330
grow.

579
00:25:49,330 --> 00:25:50,163
It was just stick to.
I forget about those forecasts for 

580
00:25:51,291 --> 00:25:52,160
recession,
but that,

581
00:25:52,161 --> 00:25:54,920
that really reveals Kennedy's decision 
making character.

582
00:25:55,160 --> 00:25:56,060
He listened,
listened,

583
00:25:56,061 --> 00:25:57,050
listened,
and then just said,

584
00:25:57,051 --> 00:25:58,100
okay,
you guys are wrong.

585
00:25:58,160 --> 00:26:00,080
We're going to do the opposite.
And that's,

586
00:26:00,081 --> 00:26:01,880
you know,
that's real decision making metal.

587
00:26:02,030 --> 00:26:05,090
So then aft in 64,
when these tax cuts go into place,

588
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:06,590
then what was the result?
Well,

589
00:26:06,620 --> 00:26:08,410
so there's still a year and a half 
there,

590
00:26:08,420 --> 00:26:09,350
if I may point out.
Yeah,

591
00:26:09,560 --> 00:26:10,393
so then in July,
Kennedy started talking to his treasury 

592
00:26:13,011 --> 00:26:13,970
secretary.
Big Time.

593
00:26:13,971 --> 00:26:16,820
Now he had communicated with them daily 
on all sorts of matters.

594
00:26:16,821 --> 00:26:18,980
But Larry and I talk a lot about seed 
Douglas Dillon,

595
00:26:18,981 --> 00:26:20,870
the unsung hero of the Kennedy 
Administration,

596
00:26:21,290 --> 00:26:23,270
Justice Richard Chesapeake Kennedy,
by the way,

597
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:25,580
I'm Kennedy's treasury secretary.
Dylan said,

598
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:27,860
you got to protect the dollar and cut 
tax rates.

599
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:28,753
That's what you gotta do.
Kenny went on national television in 

600
00:26:30,561 --> 00:26:31,220
August,
saying,

601
00:26:31,220 --> 00:26:33,170
by the way,
that's our policy.

602
00:26:33,260 --> 00:26:35,390
I'm going to introduce the bill in 
Congress.

603
00:26:35,510 --> 00:26:36,343
He did that in January of [inaudible].
Sixty three big congressional debate 

604
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:41,720
almost got passed before the 
assassination by that point,

605
00:26:41,721 --> 00:26:42,554
the markets and everyone else,
Kennedy serious about tax that and 

606
00:26:44,701 --> 00:26:46,620
that's when the huge sixties boom 
started.

607
00:26:47,280 --> 00:26:49,650
What did the parties think of this at 
the time?

608
00:26:49,651 --> 00:26:52,560
Because if you think about it in the 
context of 2018,

609
00:26:52,760 --> 00:26:55,620
the Democrats generally you are for 
higher taxes.

610
00:26:55,830 --> 00:26:58,620
Republicans generally are for lower 
taxes.

611
00:26:58,621 --> 00:26:59,454
So when Kennedy goes out there and 
listens to the advice and says this was 

612
00:27:02,760 --> 00:27:04,100
the party behind him,
right?

613
00:27:04,500 --> 00:27:06,300
Or am I looking at this only through our
2018?

614
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:07,080
No,
no,

615
00:27:07,080 --> 00:27:09,660
this is news.
This bigness.

616
00:27:09,730 --> 00:27:12,180
Larry and I talk about this in the book 
a lot.

617
00:27:13,260 --> 00:27:18,260
The party of tax rate cuts particularly 
cuts on the top rate of income tax.

618
00:27:18,511 --> 00:27:21,000
The top one.
Now back then it was 91 percent.

619
00:27:21,070 --> 00:27:23,850
That's unbelievable.
It's really hard to fathom.

620
00:27:23,851 --> 00:27:28,530
On a top rate was 91 percent.
It's so hard to fathom that it has to be

621
00:27:28,531 --> 00:27:30,390
a joke and it wasn't true because nobody
paid it.

622
00:27:30,420 --> 00:27:31,170
No,
it's true.

623
00:27:31,170 --> 00:27:32,340
Nobody paid that,
right?

624
00:27:32,420 --> 00:27:33,253
Um,
maybe 20 percent of people who should 

625
00:27:34,780 --> 00:27:37,320
been a red should have applied to pay 
to.

626
00:27:37,620 --> 00:27:40,950
That's how many loopholes there were.
And the Democrats said,

627
00:27:40,951 --> 00:27:44,550
you see these French guys,
what they're doing is they're buying off

628
00:27:44,551 --> 00:27:46,500
the tax system.
They climb,

629
00:27:46,501 --> 00:27:47,334
they're paying this rate,
and then they get all these loopholes 

630
00:27:48,371 --> 00:27:49,204
and they're hiding their money and we 
get a recession every 24 months because 

631
00:27:51,361 --> 00:27:53,070
capital is not deployed correctly.

632
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:55,020
So it was the Democrats,
Wilbur Mills,

633
00:27:55,021 --> 00:27:55,854
chairman of House Ways and means 
committee in 1959 commissioned a huge 

634
00:27:58,381 --> 00:28:00,750
2,500
page study on why we have to cut the top

635
00:28:00,751 --> 00:28:03,690
right of the income tax.
And it was the Republicans who said,

636
00:28:03,691 --> 00:28:04,860
Hey,
hold it.

637
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:06,870
You know,
we know what to do.

638
00:28:07,140 --> 00:28:08,800
We,
if we say we need a loophole,

639
00:28:08,820 --> 00:28:10,620
give us a loophole.
We're in charge here.

640
00:28:10,920 --> 00:28:13,650
So Republicans said,
no tax rate cuts.

641
00:28:13,651 --> 00:28:16,320
The system's working fun in the 
Democrats said,

642
00:28:16,321 --> 00:28:18,420
tax rate cuts to get us out of the 
cereal recession.

643
00:28:18,900 --> 00:28:22,020
What does that say about how things flip
over years in time?

644
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:24,630
Well,
I think first of all,

645
00:28:24,631 --> 00:28:26,520
we have to blame the Contemporary 
Democrats,

646
00:28:26,521 --> 00:28:28,590
Democrats today,
the last 20 years.

647
00:28:28,700 --> 00:28:29,533
Um,
what are you doing for getting your 

648
00:28:31,021 --> 00:28:32,040
legacy?
I mean,

649
00:28:32,041 --> 00:28:35,850
we can go back to the 18 twenties to 
realize that the founding of the party,

650
00:28:36,060 --> 00:28:38,880
it was about lowering top tax rates.

651
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:39,953
When you talking about the tariff,
John Calhoun and Kennedy had a lot to 

652
00:28:42,451 --> 00:28:44,040
say about calhoun through his girlfriend
Margaret.

653
00:28:44,041 --> 00:28:48,240
Quite galloon said,
yet tariff rates hurt the little guy.

654
00:28:48,690 --> 00:28:52,020
And then grover Cleveland income tax 
hurts the little guy.

655
00:28:52,170 --> 00:28:53,003
18 nineties woodrow Wilson after a 
raised taxes had three treasury 

656
00:28:57,001 --> 00:28:59,730
secretaries who said,
these are completely scarifying.

657
00:28:59,900 --> 00:29:00,733
Let's lower them.
They're killing investment in this 

658
00:29:02,251 --> 00:29:03,084
country for the little guy.
Really you can go through just about 

659
00:29:04,921 --> 00:29:07,020
every Democratic president is cut tax 
rates.

660
00:29:07,170 --> 00:29:08,970
I mean,
Bill Clinton cut the capital gains rate.

661
00:29:09,090 --> 00:29:09,923
Jimmy Carter cut the capital gains rate.
Barack Obama was spooked by the 

662
00:29:13,021 --> 00:29:16,140
exploration of the Bush tax cuts and he 
kept them from one more year.

663
00:29:16,440 --> 00:29:16,951
So,
I mean,

664
00:29:16,951 --> 00:29:19,140
there's a long history of Democrats 
getting the top right.

665
00:29:19,260 --> 00:29:20,071
Yeah.
So then,

666
00:29:20,071 --> 00:29:21,240
all right,
so 64.

667
00:29:21,270 --> 00:29:24,420
Now the economy starts going again,
k Kennedy's gone.

668
00:29:24,990 --> 00:29:28,080
Tell me a little bit more about the 
legacy of that and then sort of how that

669
00:29:28,081 --> 00:29:29,700
got to Reagan and then we'll get it.

670
00:29:29,870 --> 00:29:31,520
Okay.
Here's the basic,

671
00:29:31,521 --> 00:29:32,450
uh,
inflection.

672
00:29:32,451 --> 00:29:33,284
Here are the basic numbers.
The eight years of the Eisenhower 

673
00:29:36,090 --> 00:29:40,760
presidency in 1953 to 1961 economic 
growth was two point five percent.

674
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:42,033
Okay?
That's not good.

675
00:29:42,040 --> 00:29:44,290
Population growth than baby boom was two
point five percent.

676
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:49,320
This is complete stagnation with three 
recessions from 1961 to 1969.

677
00:29:49,361 --> 00:29:51,010
So at the beginning of the candidate 
administration,

678
00:29:51,011 --> 00:29:52,930
through the end of the Johnson 
administration,

679
00:29:53,350 --> 00:29:54,183
economic growth was five point one 
percent more than double the rate of 

680
00:29:57,131 --> 00:29:57,964
economic growth.
Now we believe it's a highly 

681
00:30:00,611 --> 00:30:04,600
attributable Larry and I,
to the policy mix that Kennedy adopted,

682
00:30:04,601 --> 00:30:06,850
which is we are going to guarantee that 
dollar.

683
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:10,240
We're not going to try to get the dollar
off the gold standard and Nixon would.

684
00:30:10,810 --> 00:30:11,643
We're going to guarantee the dollar.
So we're not going to have loose money 

685
00:30:12,941 --> 00:30:16,720
from the Fed and we're getting get money
out there by lowering tax rates,

686
00:30:16,721 --> 00:30:17,710
particularly on the rich.

687
00:30:18,290 --> 00:30:19,123
It worked.
It worked as beautifully as any public 

688
00:30:21,221 --> 00:30:23,800
policy has ever worked in,
in American history.

689
00:30:24,210 --> 00:30:25,043
All right,
so let's change gears a little bit here 

690
00:30:26,810 --> 00:30:27,643
and talk about some of the civil rights 
stuff because as all of this is 

691
00:30:29,741 --> 00:30:30,574
happening and there's a ton of.
Obviously we're talking about 

692
00:30:31,661 --> 00:30:33,370
economically mostly,
uh,

693
00:30:33,371 --> 00:30:36,990
the civil rights movement was,
was happening in,

694
00:30:37,040 --> 00:30:39,850
it's in its best sense.
So I guess first,

695
00:30:39,851 --> 00:30:40,684
what was his innate feelings about the 
civil rights movement and we'll talk 

696
00:30:44,861 --> 00:30:46,540
about some of the specific.
Yeah,

697
00:30:46,980 --> 00:30:50,050
I think John F Kennedy was in favor of 
the civil rights movement.

698
00:30:50,650 --> 00:30:53,950
I think he clearly thought that there 
should be equal opportunity and a lot of

699
00:30:53,951 --> 00:30:56,290
the recalcitrance that could be found in
the country,

700
00:30:56,370 --> 00:30:57,310
um,
you know,

701
00:30:57,311 --> 00:31:01,720
was regrettable and should be lifted 
when it came to policy though,

702
00:31:01,750 --> 00:31:05,500
he was characteristically slow moving.
So how,

703
00:31:05,501 --> 00:31:07,990
so for example,
like what could he have done earlier,

704
00:31:08,470 --> 00:31:09,040
etc.

705
00:31:09,040 --> 00:31:09,940
Well,
yeah,

706
00:31:09,941 --> 00:31:10,774
I mean now we should note that slow 
moving might make sense and that a lot 

707
00:31:15,821 --> 00:31:18,970
of civil rights activists argue with 
that the laws are already on the books.

708
00:31:19,010 --> 00:31:23,350
I mean there's nothing We need to do 
except just be true to ourselves and all

709
00:31:23,351 --> 00:31:27,820
the problems will be lifted you the 
freedom rides.

710
00:31:27,970 --> 00:31:28,803
He made phone calls and a birmingham 
jail when martin luther king was in the 

711
00:31:32,770 --> 00:31:34,840
birmingham crisis in april,
may of 19,

712
00:31:34,841 --> 00:31:35,674
63.
Kennedy wasn't doing a lot aside from 

713
00:31:40,061 --> 00:31:40,894
just kind of pressure verbally.
But the funny thing about that is that 

714
00:31:47,010 --> 00:31:49,990
what a lot of leaders said in a Philip 
Randolph had been saying this for a long

715
00:31:49,991 --> 00:31:52,030
time,
Is that we need jobs.

716
00:31:52,390 --> 00:31:53,800
You know,
civil rights is nice,

717
00:31:54,190 --> 00:31:55,023
but when black unemployment 
unemployment's 20 percent and when you 

718
00:31:57,491 --> 00:32:01,150
don't have any shackles to rub together 
would go to civil rights.

719
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:03,400
So kennedy started understand,
oh,

720
00:32:03,460 --> 00:32:06,760
if we have a booming economy,
a lot of people in this country,

721
00:32:06,761 --> 00:32:09,580
including whites,
are going to start relaxing and say,

722
00:32:09,640 --> 00:32:10,600
sure,
blacks,

723
00:32:10,601 --> 00:32:11,440
whites,
everything.

724
00:32:11,800 --> 00:32:15,180
Because everyone is well off and that 
kennedy perceived.

725
00:32:15,181 --> 00:32:18,670
That's one of the reasons he cut taxes.
So I know I'm going to get some crap for

726
00:32:18,671 --> 00:32:19,504
saying this,
but that almost seems like the trump 

727
00:32:21,430 --> 00:32:25,960
view of equality that trump has been 
cutting taxes.

728
00:32:26,500 --> 00:32:27,760
Uh,
the,

729
00:32:27,880 --> 00:32:29,260
I think I read just a couple of weeks 
ago,

730
00:32:29,261 --> 00:32:31,900
the black unemployment is at an all time
low right now,

731
00:32:32,140 --> 00:32:35,210
so he was sort of taking that.
That's a page from the jfk book.

732
00:32:35,860 --> 00:32:36,693
It is.
And when I talk about the civil rights 

733
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:43,070
act of four $65 and 64 when kennedy 
introduced in june of [inaudible] 63 and

734
00:32:43,071 --> 00:32:44,870
it was passed,
um,

735
00:32:45,350 --> 00:32:46,880
I don't know if the tax cut have been 
passed.

736
00:32:46,881 --> 00:32:49,440
If we had had a growing economy and five
percent in the fifth days,

737
00:32:49,441 --> 00:32:51,620
would we have even thought to have a 
civil rights act?

738
00:32:51,621 --> 00:32:52,454
I don't know because everyone might have
been getting along well enough that 

739
00:32:55,881 --> 00:32:59,270
kennedy kind of came to that realization
and that's a real thing.

740
00:32:59,271 --> 00:33:02,270
so if we perceive it today,
we shouldn't run away from it.

741
00:33:02,271 --> 00:33:03,680
That's a,
that's a good association.

742
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:04,553
Yeah.
It's interesting because I know even 

743
00:33:06,031 --> 00:33:07,860
just by saying those two names in the 
same sentence,

744
00:33:07,861 --> 00:33:09,450
a certain amount of people that are 
going to be angry at me,

745
00:33:09,451 --> 00:33:11,220
but that's all right.
Um,

746
00:33:11,640 --> 00:33:12,473
what,
what was the nature of his relationship 

747
00:33:13,411 --> 00:33:14,244
with martin luther king?
Because I've read a bit about it and it 

748
00:33:16,501 --> 00:33:18,360
sounds like it was,
it was kind of complex.

749
00:33:18,361 --> 00:33:20,580
There were places where they were lined 
up,

750
00:33:20,581 --> 00:33:21,490
but not all the time.

751
00:33:21,520 --> 00:33:24,250
Well,
let me answer it this way.

752
00:33:24,280 --> 00:33:27,010
What was the federal government's 
relationship with martin luther king?

753
00:33:27,011 --> 00:33:28,360
Because jagger,
hoover of course,

754
00:33:28,361 --> 00:33:29,194
is still doing his thing,
his fbi director with all the kind of 

755
00:33:32,591 --> 00:33:33,424
surveillance,
probably harassment of martin luther 

756
00:33:35,201 --> 00:33:39,160
king and kennedy is paralyzed as 
everyone is with the fbi.

757
00:33:39,730 --> 00:33:41,260
Um,
so there's that.

758
00:33:41,350 --> 00:33:42,183
I mean,
kennedy is not doing anything about the 

759
00:33:44,291 --> 00:33:45,124
kind of harassment

760
00:33:45,170 --> 00:33:48,260
kennedy know about that.
Do we know if kennedy knew that all that

761
00:33:48,261 --> 00:33:48,980
was happening?

762
00:33:48,980 --> 00:33:49,813
I'd have to look at the files.
We have a lot of those remain 

763
00:33:53,541 --> 00:33:55,150
classified.
Um,

764
00:33:55,250 --> 00:33:56,420
so I'm not totally sure.

765
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:57,313
Yeah.
They have declassified some of this 

766
00:33:57,981 --> 00:33:59,450
stuff just in the last year,
right?

767
00:33:59,460 --> 00:34:02,630
It's exposed a little bit more of the 
surveillance that was happening.

768
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:03,610
Yeah,
mlk.

769
00:34:03,730 --> 00:34:06,490
right.
But what about their personality

770
00:34:06,520 --> 00:34:07,870
relationship?
Yeah,

771
00:34:08,680 --> 00:34:12,460
I think kennedy appreciated kings,
intellectual ism.

772
00:34:12,580 --> 00:34:13,413
I mean there was kind of.
He brought a king into the white house 

773
00:34:16,511 --> 00:34:17,344
and then he,
he watched the march on Washington from 

774
00:34:19,751 --> 00:34:20,584
the portico of the white house,
kind of peering around the corner and 

775
00:34:22,541 --> 00:34:25,660
then invited everyone back afterwards 
and he apparently said,

776
00:34:25,661 --> 00:34:29,290
I wish I could be out there with them 
and acted chummy with king,

777
00:34:29,530 --> 00:34:31,540
but he did kind of keep them at arm's 
length.

778
00:34:31,541 --> 00:34:35,380
I think he was a little worried about 
king's association,

779
00:34:35,460 --> 00:34:39,820
a invidious or not with communism 
because kennedy was very anticommunist.

780
00:34:39,890 --> 00:34:40,300
Right.

781
00:34:40,300 --> 00:34:43,360
So that's interesting because a,
from when we're taping this,

782
00:34:43,361 --> 00:34:47,810
it was just a couple of weeks ago that 
it was a martin luther king day and I,

783
00:34:47,811 --> 00:34:48,970
you know,
I find it,

784
00:34:49,030 --> 00:34:51,460
it's one of the strangest days to be on,
on twitter.

785
00:34:51,461 --> 00:34:53,470
not that you can garner that much 
embraced twitter,

786
00:34:53,640 --> 00:34:54,473
but where everyone's sort of takes mlk 
and uses them for their modern day 

787
00:34:57,700 --> 00:34:59,290
political purpose.
Right.

788
00:34:59,350 --> 00:35:00,183
So the meme.
So some people saying he was a 

789
00:35:00,941 --> 00:35:02,620
socialist,
some people saying he was a communist,

790
00:35:02,621 --> 00:35:03,454
he was an environmentalist,
eat whatever you want him to be within 

791
00:35:05,591 --> 00:35:07,960
your 2018 lens.
That's what people use.

792
00:35:07,961 --> 00:35:10,810
But that's really interesting to me.
But jfk had this,

793
00:35:11,050 --> 00:35:12,970
this idea of built in him from 
childhood,

794
00:35:12,971 --> 00:35:14,950
as you were saying about hating 
communism.

795
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:16,593
Mlk had some association,
at least with sort of loosely communism 

796
00:35:19,871 --> 00:35:20,704
or socialism or certainly had issues 
with the United States government and 

797
00:35:23,530 --> 00:35:25,930
certain levels of capitalism.
So they did have.

798
00:35:25,990 --> 00:35:27,640
They were at loggerheads in some way.

799
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:28,593
Yeah,
I think kennedy did not want to get 

800
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:31,150
burned by king.
In other words,

801
00:35:31,151 --> 00:35:33,820
he didn't want to kind of bring king 
into his inner circle.

802
00:35:33,821 --> 00:35:37,520
And then king manifests himself as a 
flaming communist kennedy.

803
00:35:37,530 --> 00:35:40,470
It was way too cool a character to get 
burned that way.

804
00:35:40,740 --> 00:35:43,620
But by the summer of [inaudible] 63.
So after the birmingham crisis,

805
00:35:43,890 --> 00:35:46,290
which was the national outrage on 
television,

806
00:35:46,670 --> 00:35:49,200
can I get heckled and his speeches?
Hey,

807
00:35:49,201 --> 00:35:50,580
you're not doing anything about civil 
rights.

808
00:35:51,150 --> 00:35:55,620
And that's when he really pushed the tax
cut in that august and september nine,

809
00:35:55,640 --> 00:35:56,473
63.
Which is when the march on Washington 

810
00:35:57,301 --> 00:35:58,134
happen,
and let's remember the subtitle of the 

811
00:35:59,071 --> 00:36:00,450
march on Washington,
martin luther king,

812
00:36:00,451 --> 00:36:01,920
a Philip Randolph was march on 
Washington,

813
00:36:01,921 --> 00:36:02,754
was the march on Washington for jobs and
freedom and those are the two sides of 

814
00:36:06,661 --> 00:36:08,550
kennedy's legislative agenda,
tax cut.

815
00:36:08,670 --> 00:36:11,160
Civil rights act.
Kennedy actually felt,

816
00:36:11,190 --> 00:36:13,590
we believe that if you had the tax cut 
early enough,

817
00:36:13,591 --> 00:36:15,000
you wouldn't even need the civil rights 
act.

818
00:36:15,630 --> 00:36:16,463
So that's the way kind of kennedy 
walkthrough this going to complicated 

819
00:36:19,170 --> 00:36:23,220
politics.
So he really sounds to me sort of like a

820
00:36:23,221 --> 00:36:24,054
politician's politician.
He doesn't sound much like an ideolog 

821
00:36:27,250 --> 00:36:28,083
specifically,
and that he really was listening to the 

822
00:36:30,061 --> 00:36:30,894
people about him.
Is there anything else that we're 

823
00:36:31,411 --> 00:36:34,770
missing to sort of get the full picture 
on the way he tried to govern?

824
00:36:34,920 --> 00:36:37,230
Yeah,
I mean he got lucky too,

825
00:36:37,231 --> 00:36:39,540
and I hate to use that word in this 
context.

826
00:36:39,610 --> 00:36:42,600
I'm the most outrageous event in the 
history of the rights movement.

827
00:36:42,601 --> 00:36:46,530
Might be the birmingham birmingham 
church bombing and September,

828
00:36:46,530 --> 00:36:48,270
1963 when the four girls were killed by 
dynamite,

829
00:36:48,630 --> 00:36:49,463
um,
that actually made kennedy's tax cut 

830
00:36:51,270 --> 00:36:52,103
because the event was so outrageous.
Case tax bill was being voted on in 

831
00:36:54,931 --> 00:36:55,501
congress.
Right.

832
00:36:55,501 --> 00:37:00,501
Then the southern democrats did not feel
like they could make a show of defeating

833
00:37:00,871 --> 00:37:01,704
kennedy's legislation because that event
was so outrageous and then it slipped 

834
00:37:05,221 --> 00:37:07,110
through the house and passed right 
there.

835
00:37:07,620 --> 00:37:08,453
So the birmingham church bombing 
actually had a lot to do with the 

836
00:37:10,861 --> 00:37:13,500
passage of the kennedy tax cut.
That's interesting.

837
00:37:13,501 --> 00:37:14,760
So yeah,
I know kennedy,

838
00:37:15,210 --> 00:37:19,170
he was okay as a legislator,
but I mean he got away with a lot too.

839
00:37:19,171 --> 00:37:20,280
And he got,
he got a little lucky.

840
00:37:20,670 --> 00:37:22,340
Interesting.
So speaking of luck,

841
00:37:22,410 --> 00:37:23,890
let's talk about the cuban missile 
crisis.

842
00:37:23,940 --> 00:37:26,430
Got a little bit,
because I guess this really is the.

843
00:37:26,670 --> 00:37:27,503
well,
I guess you would argue that the tax 

844
00:37:28,471 --> 00:37:29,304
guides really are his biggest legacy,
but I think most people think of the 

845
00:37:32,011 --> 00:37:33,340
cuban missile crisis.
Uh,

846
00:37:33,390 --> 00:37:35,180
so just to kind of set the stage.
Sure.

847
00:37:35,580 --> 00:37:37,290
Well,
I just want to point out in terms of his

848
00:37:37,291 --> 00:37:40,500
legislative agenda,
I don't think it's disputable,

849
00:37:40,501 --> 00:37:42,330
but the tax cut was his most important 
legacy.

850
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:43,800
Maybe the civil rights act,
but yeah,

851
00:37:43,801 --> 00:37:44,634
when it comes to foreign policy,
we're talking about two different 

852
00:37:47,170 --> 00:37:47,490
ballgames.

853
00:37:47,490 --> 00:37:48,323
Yeah,
like even as a grad and now that played 

854
00:37:49,751 --> 00:37:53,310
right to kennedy's strength,
I'm afraid because if it was going to be

855
00:37:53,311 --> 00:37:54,144
clarified,
there's going to be a contest between 

856
00:37:56,321 --> 00:37:59,460
the us and the representative communism,
the soviet union,

857
00:37:59,820 --> 00:38:00,653
the us was going to win so that that 
played right into his hands so that we 

858
00:38:03,211 --> 00:38:04,960
know that that's built into him from 
child.

859
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:07,650
Just give me a cuban missile.
Crisis was kind of one on one,

860
00:38:07,651 --> 00:38:10,530
a little bit about wHat led up to what 
his decision making was.

861
00:38:10,531 --> 00:38:11,364
That showed a piece of wonder.
So nikita khrushchev is the premier of 

862
00:38:14,371 --> 00:38:17,280
the soviet union and they use new client
states and Cuba.

863
00:38:17,281 --> 00:38:21,880
If ever since fidel castro had taken 
over in 59 and a.

864
00:38:21,900 --> 00:38:24,870
He khrushchev sent nuclear missiles to 
Cuba,

865
00:38:25,140 --> 00:38:27,690
so there'd be 90 miles away from us 
territory in Florida.

866
00:38:28,470 --> 00:38:32,460
When this is discovered,
a kennedy tells the soviets they have to

867
00:38:32,461 --> 00:38:34,270
get out immediately.
[inaudible]

868
00:38:34,300 --> 00:38:35,133
has done a great tension,
could lead to the firing of missiles in 

869
00:38:38,651 --> 00:38:40,900
kennedy,
gets khrushchev to face down.

870
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:43,780
Kennedy gets him to say,
okay,

871
00:38:43,900 --> 00:38:48,190
we'll pull our missiles out,
and it was Big akan christians face back

872
00:38:48,191 --> 00:38:50,350
in the soviet union.
One tidbit about that,

873
00:38:51,220 --> 00:38:52,053
the documents that came out in november 
on the presidential assassination do 

874
00:38:55,451 --> 00:38:57,490
seat just this past november,
the last couple of months ago,

875
00:38:57,790 --> 00:38:58,623
do seem to indicate that khrushchev gave
the order after that humiliation to all 

876
00:39:03,881 --> 00:39:04,714
networks globally.
The kennedy should be assassinated and 

877
00:39:07,211 --> 00:39:10,870
lee harvey oswald may have begun his 
preparations because of that director.

878
00:39:11,410 --> 00:39:12,640
Wow.
All right,

879
00:39:12,641 --> 00:39:14,470
so I do want to talk about the 
assassination.

880
00:39:14,471 --> 00:39:15,304
Obviously even just the way you said 
that there's so much of it that it's 

881
00:39:18,001 --> 00:39:18,834
hard to piece together.
And how far do you want to go down the 

882
00:39:20,351 --> 00:39:22,270
rabbit hole and filed the conspiracies 
and all that,

883
00:39:22,271 --> 00:39:23,110
but we will get to that.

884
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:24,273
But what.
What was the final Moment that got 

885
00:39:25,901 --> 00:39:27,160
khrushchev to turn down?
I mean,

886
00:39:27,161 --> 00:39:28,870
did kennedy basicaLly say,
well,

887
00:39:28,871 --> 00:39:32,920
I know there's the line of course,
but was it really communicated like this

888
00:39:32,921 --> 00:39:37,921
is going to be world war three?
I thinK to answer that question,

889
00:39:38,560 --> 00:39:41,860
um,
we have to speak russian and have access

890
00:39:41,861 --> 00:39:46,861
to the archives because I think what 
happened is that crew chef felt pressure

891
00:39:47,381 --> 00:39:48,590
at home.
Um,

892
00:39:48,730 --> 00:39:49,563
as a lot of people have said,
the soviet union really was the status 

893
00:39:51,311 --> 00:39:54,660
quo power in the politburo began asking 
khrushchev,

894
00:39:54,970 --> 00:39:55,803
um,
are you going to take our lives away 

895
00:39:56,651 --> 00:39:58,300
from us?
You're going to take our summer docos on

896
00:39:58,301 --> 00:40:03,220
the caspian sea away from us and our,
our 10 percent of us in the soviet union

897
00:40:03,221 --> 00:40:04,780
who have a nice life.
Um,

898
00:40:04,870 --> 00:40:07,180
what are you doing?
Would you please Back down?

899
00:40:07,240 --> 00:40:09,730
it seems that whatever kennedy was 
doing,

900
00:40:10,060 --> 00:40:12,820
the real folding happened on the soviet 
side.

901
00:40:13,210 --> 00:40:16,060
And chris,
jeff was not the first among equals.

902
00:40:16,061 --> 00:40:16,721
I mean,
he did not.

903
00:40:16,721 --> 00:40:18,490
He was barely premier of the soviet 
union.

904
00:40:18,730 --> 00:40:19,563
So it seems that,
and we don't have enough information on 

905
00:40:21,371 --> 00:40:22,204
this because it's behind the source 
walls that the russians backed down 

906
00:40:25,061 --> 00:40:26,880
because they realized khrushchev was 
acting crazy.

907
00:40:26,890 --> 00:40:29,170
Yeah.
This may sound like an amateur question,

908
00:40:29,171 --> 00:40:32,410
but did they ever actually speak the two
of them through translators?

909
00:40:32,411 --> 00:40:36,220
Was there ever or everything goes 
through the communication for review.

910
00:40:36,221 --> 00:40:38,650
There's a great book on this called one 
hell of A gamble,

911
00:40:38,810 --> 00:40:39,643
uh,
which has all the documents is amazing 

912
00:40:41,531 --> 00:40:43,760
book by ernest may and phil zelikow 
from,

913
00:40:43,930 --> 00:40:45,790
from the 1990.
So let's look that up.

914
00:40:46,510 --> 00:40:48,460
How much after the cuban missile crisis,
I mean,

915
00:40:48,461 --> 00:40:50,620
that really changed everything in 
american foreign policy,

916
00:40:50,621 --> 00:40:51,041
right?
I mean,

917
00:40:51,041 --> 00:40:54,040
it really was a huge catalyst for a lot.
Well,

918
00:40:54,130 --> 00:40:56,650
we argue in our book,
um,

919
00:40:57,010 --> 00:40:57,843
that the,
the big change foreign policy wise came 

920
00:41:00,101 --> 00:41:00,934
a year later when kennedy countenanced 
assisted in the assassination of the 

921
00:41:04,361 --> 00:41:07,090
south vietnamese president's am in 
november,

922
00:41:07,091 --> 00:41:09,160
just a couple of weeks before kennedy's 
assassination.

923
00:41:09,220 --> 00:41:11,170
And that seems to have been the tipping 
point in Vietnam.

924
00:41:11,230 --> 00:41:12,063
I'm telling you,
I've been listening to a lot of the 

925
00:41:13,061 --> 00:41:15,790
kennedy tapes on Vietnam with mcnamara 
and everything else.

926
00:41:16,580 --> 00:41:17,413
It is true that kennedy had no real 
interest in a longterm war in southeast 

927
00:41:20,680 --> 00:41:21,910
asia and no,
he didn't.

928
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:23,313
What on earth he was doing helping to 
assassinate cme and I have no idea and 

929
00:41:26,681 --> 00:41:27,514
that was a big mistake.
So was that really just because he had 

930
00:41:31,301 --> 00:41:32,134
this again,
he had this thing drilled him from his 

931
00:41:33,891 --> 00:41:34,370
father

932
00:41:34,370 --> 00:41:35,203
from childhood about communism and maybe
that overrode the intellectual part of 

933
00:41:39,891 --> 00:41:40,724
him that said,
let's not get into these intractable 

934
00:41:41,910 --> 00:41:42,250
wars.

935
00:41:42,250 --> 00:41:43,470
Yeah,
I think.

936
00:41:43,900 --> 00:41:48,040
I think gm and Vietnam was one of those 
people that madden kennedy,

937
00:41:48,041 --> 00:41:50,560
because he didn't like king.
He didn't want you to bring him into,

938
00:41:50,620 --> 00:41:53,020
into his circle.
And then have you burned him?

939
00:41:54,310 --> 00:41:56,590
Tim was an american guy.
Yeah.

940
00:41:56,620 --> 00:41:57,453
He's our guy in south Vietnam and he 
just kept alienating people and making 

941
00:42:00,731 --> 00:42:03,520
life difficult for the monks scenario 
and kennedy's like,

942
00:42:03,550 --> 00:42:05,380
hey,
you're supposed to be our guy.

943
00:42:05,381 --> 00:42:06,550
And um,
John F.

944
00:42:06,550 --> 00:42:07,383
Kennedy.
So at some point kennedy will break and 

945
00:42:09,401 --> 00:42:09,911
just said,
okay,

946
00:42:09,911 --> 00:42:10,990
you're gone.
Gone.

947
00:42:10,991 --> 00:42:11,824
And this meant that.
Fascinated and that is rare in the 

948
00:42:16,061 --> 00:42:18,100
kennedy ambit,
um,

949
00:42:18,280 --> 00:42:22,930
and it ended up being not good for 
american and vietnamese fortunes for the

950
00:42:22,931 --> 00:42:24,280
next 10 years.

951
00:42:24,390 --> 00:42:25,223
Yeah.
What else do we need to know about your 

952
00:42:26,200 --> 00:42:27,033
sort of,
the personal side in terms of what was 

953
00:42:28,981 --> 00:42:31,440
going on in the white house during those
years?

954
00:42:32,200 --> 00:42:35,020
Yeah,
I mean he ran an elegant white house and

955
00:42:35,021 --> 00:42:37,110
all that.
He did have his Kids.

956
00:42:37,120 --> 00:42:37,953
Girlfriends really kind of did that,
that side of him to desecrate the white 

957
00:42:41,041 --> 00:42:42,780
house and I think we have to understand 
what you mean.

958
00:42:42,880 --> 00:42:43,181
well,
no,

959
00:42:43,181 --> 00:42:44,014
I think it's hard for people to 
understand in a modern sense of what 

960
00:42:46,511 --> 00:42:50,170
could it be for social media before 
everyone had a phone and all that.

961
00:42:50,350 --> 00:42:51,183
Like what did the average person know 
about that at the time or what was the 

962
00:42:54,401 --> 00:42:56,460
media even saying about that?

963
00:42:56,720 --> 00:42:59,600
Well,
I kind of the wisdom of crowds.

964
00:42:59,601 --> 00:43:04,601
I think the electorate largely 
understood what was going on even though

965
00:43:04,971 --> 00:43:08,270
there's no hard evidence in the papers 
and so forth.

966
00:43:08,271 --> 00:43:10,640
And there really wasn't any hard 
evidence.

967
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:11,833
I mean,
now we know about his swimming nude and 

968
00:43:13,761 --> 00:43:14,594
this is what the pools and the secret 
service having to hold his drinks and 

969
00:43:16,401 --> 00:43:20,000
all that stuff and we know all about 
that now when judith exner may have been

970
00:43:20,300 --> 00:43:23,510
killed by the communists because she was
a plant and all that.

971
00:43:23,630 --> 00:43:25,130
Judith exner,
but give her punches.

972
00:43:25,300 --> 00:43:26,530
Nice.
Um,

973
00:43:27,470 --> 00:43:28,303
I believe that because kennedy had so 
many kind of crazy affairs in the white 

974
00:43:32,811 --> 00:43:35,630
house,
the press felt that it was burned,

975
00:43:35,750 --> 00:43:36,583
like we're not allowed to report this.
And that's really what gave us water k 

976
00:43:38,970 --> 00:43:41,420
because nixon's things were kind of 
small in comparison.

977
00:43:41,690 --> 00:43:43,280
And the press just like we got burned 
them,

978
00:43:43,281 --> 00:43:44,330
we're not going to get burned again.

979
00:43:44,580 --> 00:43:45,540
Wow.
That's fascinating.

980
00:43:45,541 --> 00:43:47,010
I've never heard anyone lay it out like 
that.

981
00:43:47,011 --> 00:43:47,844
So basically they kind of played along 
with jfk because they were trying to be 

982
00:43:50,671 --> 00:43:51,504
nice.
Maybe he was a little bit of their guys 

983
00:43:53,300 --> 00:43:54,620
sort of.
But then,

984
00:43:54,900 --> 00:43:57,440
and if they felt embarrassed by it,
I mean they felt used.

985
00:43:57,770 --> 00:44:00,320
I mean we're just shutting up about 
this.

986
00:44:00,760 --> 00:44:03,820
And then the next time a suggestion of 
that came around,

987
00:44:03,860 --> 00:44:05,690
they just went with a sledge hammer.

988
00:44:05,950 --> 00:44:07,480
Interesting.
That's really interesting.

989
00:44:07,481 --> 00:44:08,314
Sorry.
So obviously we have to talk about the 

990
00:44:09,371 --> 00:44:10,204
assassination.
Tell me a little bit just in the weeks 

991
00:44:12,731 --> 00:44:15,220
leading up to it and what was going on 
in the presidency.

992
00:44:15,440 --> 00:44:16,273
Yeah,
I think that was really kennedy's 

993
00:44:18,051 --> 00:44:18,884
highest time as president thurston 
clarke has written a great book about 

994
00:44:20,991 --> 00:44:25,250
kennedy's last hundred days from august 
to November,

995
00:44:25,250 --> 00:44:26,900
1963.
But he really was coming into his own.

996
00:44:27,350 --> 00:44:28,183
And I think that's true actually.
He kept talking to the secret service 

997
00:44:31,501 --> 00:44:31,861
agent.
Hey,

998
00:44:31,861 --> 00:44:33,720
isn't this a great day to Be alive?
I mean,

999
00:44:34,050 --> 00:44:36,540
he was really into it.
um,

1000
00:44:36,900 --> 00:44:39,140
his tax that was going through.
So [inaudible] was going through,

1001
00:44:39,150 --> 00:44:43,590
the soviets were gone.
He just says that's a footnote.

1002
00:44:44,250 --> 00:44:46,230
So how public was that by the way?
Was that.

1003
00:44:46,231 --> 00:44:47,064
Oh,
it was public.

1004
00:44:47,150 --> 00:44:48,630
It was completely public.
Well,

1005
00:44:48,631 --> 00:44:49,464
no,
it was presented as a palace coup that 

1006
00:44:51,661 --> 00:44:52,494
it was internal.
So the american fingerprints were not 

1007
00:44:54,331 --> 00:44:55,164
clear at the time.
And his ambassador is new ambassador 

1008
00:44:57,660 --> 00:44:59,260
henry cabot lodge,
uh,

1009
00:44:59,350 --> 00:45:04,290
who defeated in the senate race and 
fifties was kind of the fall guy,

1010
00:45:04,291 --> 00:45:05,124
so it appears that he put somebody in 
and sat in saigon who would have to 

1011
00:45:09,120 --> 00:45:10,380
endure the dirty work.

1012
00:45:10,860 --> 00:45:13,470
So aside from that,
kennedy's enjoying watching polo,

1013
00:45:13,471 --> 00:45:14,304
horace mitchell missile launches and 
he's laughing at the senate finance 

1014
00:45:17,551 --> 00:45:18,384
committee,
which is trying to hold up his tax cut 

1015
00:45:19,830 --> 00:45:21,690
and it sounds like you guys keep trying 
to hold it up,

1016
00:45:21,720 --> 00:45:22,920
but you know,
I'm going to win.

1017
00:45:23,070 --> 00:45:25,020
So he's really kind of coming into his 
own.

1018
00:45:25,470 --> 00:45:29,750
And then November 22nd.
So what was it,

1019
00:45:29,850 --> 00:45:30,683
you know,
how to ask this question properly 

1020
00:45:32,251 --> 00:45:34,110
because you see everyone seen so much 
about it,

1021
00:45:34,111 --> 00:45:39,000
but the new starts breaking and it's 
hard to imagine what breaking news would

1022
00:45:39,001 --> 00:45:40,710
be like at that time.
Now,

1023
00:45:41,130 --> 00:45:44,310
can you kind of frame that a little bit?
We can see these.

1024
00:45:44,311 --> 00:45:46,260
They're on youtube.
Um,

1025
00:45:46,530 --> 00:45:49,090
so we,
soap operas back then were,

1026
00:45:49,120 --> 00:45:49,953
were alive.
So they will be live actors acting out 

1027
00:45:53,701 --> 00:45:56,820
the soap opera and they were broken 
into.

1028
00:45:56,850 --> 00:45:59,220
and you can watch this again and on the 
internet right now,

1029
00:45:59,760 --> 00:46:01,310
uh,
with bulletins from wall,

1030
00:46:01,340 --> 00:46:03,620
from a walter cronkite and so forth,
uh,

1031
00:46:03,630 --> 00:46:04,560
saying that,
uh,

1032
00:46:04,561 --> 00:46:05,394
there's been an incident,
dallas President's been shot and then 

1033
00:46:07,081 --> 00:46:07,914
they would go back to the live acting 
and then the actors would just start 

1034
00:46:10,320 --> 00:46:13,440
acting again about the drama of the soap
opeRa.

1035
00:46:14,430 --> 00:46:18,210
But it took about probably about 45 
minutes to an hour for people to realize

1036
00:46:18,211 --> 00:46:20,990
that that happened here.
When the,

1037
00:46:20,991 --> 00:46:24,470
the conspiracies start popping like 
immediately where people go,

1038
00:46:24,530 --> 00:46:26,130
something is wrong here,
you know,

1039
00:46:26,131 --> 00:46:26,964
why was he taking this sort of circular 
route and around with the topless card 

1040
00:46:32,100 --> 00:46:34,980
and all of that stuff.
Like people immediately doing that.

1041
00:46:35,070 --> 00:46:35,671
Well,
yeah.

1042
00:46:35,671 --> 00:46:39,810
I mean the trip to dallas itself was 
controversial.

1043
00:46:39,811 --> 00:46:40,644
It was in the planning in october,
november because dallas was a hotbed of 

1044
00:46:45,061 --> 00:46:47,850
kind of what we might call white 
supremacy.

1045
00:46:48,360 --> 00:46:49,980
And people worry.
Well,

1046
00:46:50,070 --> 00:46:52,740
and kennedy said it's not country down 
there.

1047
00:46:52,800 --> 00:46:53,633
They're kind of anticandida even though 
they voted for kennedy because of 

1048
00:46:55,741 --> 00:46:56,574
johnson on the ticket.
so everyone was worried about his not 

1049
00:46:59,491 --> 00:47:03,000
getting a good reception in Texas from 
the,

1050
00:47:03,001 --> 00:47:05,370
kind of called them racist,
you know,

1051
00:47:05,371 --> 00:47:07,170
whites,
if you want to use those terms.

1052
00:47:08,010 --> 00:47:11,280
But the trip was totally successful on 
those counts.

1053
00:47:11,281 --> 00:47:12,114
He went to fort worth and a huge 
celebration and he went to dallas and 

1054
00:47:15,871 --> 00:47:19,530
everyone loved them in the last words,
perhaps spoken to John F.

1055
00:47:19,530 --> 00:47:20,880
Kennedy were from connally's wife in the
car.

1056
00:47:20,881 --> 00:47:21,714
Well,
it's all over now and you can't say the 

1057
00:47:23,041 --> 00:47:25,590
Texas doesn't love you.
And then he was blown away.

1058
00:47:26,070 --> 00:47:27,060
Wow.
Incredible.

1059
00:47:27,061 --> 00:47:28,880
So,
you know,

1060
00:47:28,890 --> 00:47:30,100
I think the first time that I

1061
00:47:30,100 --> 00:47:30,933
paid at the end,
the attention to this was probably in 

1062
00:47:32,051 --> 00:47:34,120
high school when I saw the movie,
jfk.

1063
00:47:34,210 --> 00:47:35,740
Uh,
I assume you've seen the video.

1064
00:47:36,820 --> 00:47:40,300
So how far is as someone that really 
cares about this story and all that,

1065
00:47:40,301 --> 00:47:41,134
I mean,
how far down all these rabbit holes are 

1066
00:47:42,791 --> 00:47:43,624
you willing to go?
It sounds like some of it's still 

1067
00:47:45,191 --> 00:47:47,170
unfolding as new documents still come 
out,

1068
00:47:47,380 --> 00:47:50,980
but just for you as someone that is 
interested in this.

1069
00:47:51,470 --> 00:47:52,670
Yeah,
I mean I think,

1070
00:47:52,671 --> 00:47:53,504
um,
there are a couple aspects of the 

1071
00:47:54,891 --> 00:47:57,540
assassination that we have to take 
seriously,

1072
00:47:57,541 --> 00:48:00,110
that we have to kind of lose our 
sophistication about,

1073
00:48:00,111 --> 00:48:01,790
oh,
oswald acted alone.

1074
00:48:01,850 --> 00:48:02,683
Now hold it up.
Dealey plaza is the best place possible 

1075
00:48:05,631 --> 00:48:07,760
for an assassination.
That's where it happened.

1076
00:48:08,210 --> 00:48:11,000
That should interest us in terms of 
conspiracy theories.

1077
00:48:11,440 --> 00:48:12,470
Can you,
can you explain why?

1078
00:48:12,471 --> 00:48:15,430
I mean there's that slow turn as the 
points of vision.

1079
00:48:15,450 --> 00:48:16,283
Oh,
it's at the end of the parade routes to 

1080
00:48:18,111 --> 00:48:18,944
the parade is over and then there has to
be a right turn and a left turn that 

1081
00:48:22,101 --> 00:48:25,340
goes then downhill.
So the parade's over,

1082
00:48:25,341 --> 00:48:28,940
which means the intensity of the 
experiences over in the secret services,

1083
00:48:29,200 --> 00:48:31,970
um,
interest will start to wane.

1084
00:48:32,120 --> 00:48:35,120
And that was absolutely essential in the
assassination.

1085
00:48:35,990 --> 00:48:38,270
Then.
So there's that setting in those,

1086
00:48:38,271 --> 00:48:39,104
the school book depository right there 
with an aggressive goal and an overpass 

1087
00:48:42,081 --> 00:48:44,110
to stemmons freeway.
And um,

1088
00:48:44,330 --> 00:48:46,190
well it's a perfect place for 
assassination.

1089
00:48:46,191 --> 00:48:48,770
So therefore we should stop this pseudo 
sophistication about,

1090
00:48:48,771 --> 00:48:49,820
oh,
alice world acted alone.

1091
00:48:50,210 --> 00:48:53,540
The other thing too is kennedy was 
absurdly good at making enemies.

1092
00:48:53,900 --> 00:48:54,920
I mean,
he just made enemies,

1093
00:48:54,921 --> 00:48:56,990
I mean,
his father made enemies for a living.

1094
00:48:57,540 --> 00:48:58,060
So

1095
00:48:58,060 --> 00:49:00,460
by the way,
we've talked for 45 or 50 minutes and we

1096
00:49:00,461 --> 00:49:02,740
haven't even said in military industrial
complex one.

1097
00:49:02,910 --> 00:49:05,170
We obviously had some sort of issues 
with him,

1098
00:49:05,171 --> 00:49:06,250
which we can touch on it though,

1099
00:49:06,530 --> 00:49:08,210
right?
So,

1100
00:49:08,300 --> 00:49:10,100
um,
so,

1101
00:49:10,101 --> 00:49:14,390
and oswald also had connections to beat 
the band with the mob.

1102
00:49:14,410 --> 00:49:15,890
The soviets,
cubans,

1103
00:49:15,891 --> 00:49:16,610
you know,
I mean,

1104
00:49:16,610 --> 00:49:21,080
so that's also very fruitful.
Jack ruby oswald was killed.

1105
00:49:21,140 --> 00:49:22,700
Jack ruby has connections to beat the 
band.

1106
00:49:22,710 --> 00:49:26,120
So these are all suggestive nonetheless.
James pearson's book,

1107
00:49:26,121 --> 00:49:28,350
camelot and the cultural revolution is 
the best book ever written,

1108
00:49:28,351 --> 00:49:29,184
but about the kennedy assassination in.
It is about the liberal reaction to the 

1109
00:49:32,661 --> 00:49:33,494
kennedy assassination because liberals 
to this day have pinned it on the white 

1110
00:49:37,431 --> 00:49:40,250
supremacists in dallas.
And that's just crazy.

1111
00:49:40,610 --> 00:49:43,210
He was killed because he was a con 
because he was an anticommunist.

1112
00:49:43,220 --> 00:49:44,053
I mean,
that's pretty clear that lee harvey 

1113
00:49:45,291 --> 00:49:47,960
oswald killed John F.
Kennedy because John F.

1114
00:49:47,960 --> 00:49:48,793
Kennedy was anticommunist and we now are
starting to piece together that he may 

1115
00:49:52,521 --> 00:49:55,430
have felt he was acting on orders from 
the soviet union.

1116
00:49:56,550 --> 00:49:57,383
We may have felt.
That's an interesting way of phrasing 

1117
00:49:59,401 --> 00:50:00,780
it.
What do you mean may have felt

1118
00:50:02,020 --> 00:50:02,853
well?
Oswald was quite a character and what 

1119
00:50:04,181 --> 00:50:05,650
was going on in his head.
We don't know.

1120
00:50:05,651 --> 00:50:08,500
We do know that he met.
He went to the cube,

1121
00:50:08,530 --> 00:50:09,363
the cuban embassy to me,
to soviet assassination expert in 

1122
00:50:11,831 --> 00:50:13,030
september 19,
63.

1123
00:50:14,590 --> 00:50:19,590
The documents that just came out imply 
that it was understood in late 1962,

1124
00:50:21,070 --> 00:50:21,903
that nikita khrushchev,
after getting burned in the cuban 

1125
00:50:23,231 --> 00:50:24,064
missile crisis,
may have sent out some kind of broad 

1126
00:50:26,261 --> 00:50:27,094
order into the global soviet network 
than it would be desirable if president 

1127
00:50:30,201 --> 00:50:31,034
at states were assassinated in that 
order may have been called back because 

1128
00:50:35,211 --> 00:50:37,400
of pressure within the politburo at 
chris chef,

1129
00:50:37,401 --> 00:50:40,160
you're still acting like a nut.
Khrushchev was forced out in 1964,

1130
00:50:41,210 --> 00:50:44,120
but once you squeeze the toothpaste out 
of the tube,

1131
00:50:44,121 --> 00:50:47,240
it's done hard to get it back in.
So it may be,

1132
00:50:47,241 --> 00:50:52,100
this is speculation,
but grounded in some sources that oswald

1133
00:50:52,101 --> 00:50:52,934
was part of that initial outreach and 
then may not have stopped and then went 

1134
00:50:56,721 --> 00:50:57,554
ahead with it.

1135
00:50:58,460 --> 00:51:01,040
So basically you're willing to go down 
these,

1136
00:51:01,220 --> 00:51:03,540
these routes.
You sort of have to do that.

1137
00:51:03,770 --> 00:51:06,580
The more I read about this and the more 
of these documentaries I watched,

1138
00:51:07,230 --> 00:51:09,020
you know,
I've got across the and book right there

1139
00:51:09,021 --> 00:51:10,110
and I always quote,
you know,

1140
00:51:10,160 --> 00:51:12,530
extraordinary claims require 
extraordinary evidence.

1141
00:51:12,531 --> 00:51:14,360
So I don't know that we have the 
extraordinary evidence,

1142
00:51:14,660 --> 00:51:17,970
but there were so many pieces in play 
here that,

1143
00:51:17,971 --> 00:51:21,380
that make it seem hard to believe.
I think the one thing that is firming up

1144
00:51:21,381 --> 00:51:22,214
pretty well is that oswald killed 
kennedy because he perceived kennedy to 

1145
00:51:25,791 --> 00:51:26,624
be anticommunist.
So it was the left that killed kennedy 

1146
00:51:30,980 --> 00:51:34,050
because kennedy was too right wing,
um,

1147
00:51:34,250 --> 00:51:36,470
that's been lost over the last 50 some 
years.

1148
00:51:36,710 --> 00:51:39,200
That is firming up through a lot of 
sources.

1149
00:51:39,440 --> 00:51:40,273
that's the most important thing.
I think to conclude then with the deep 

1150
00:51:42,531 --> 00:51:44,930
story of oswald's connections are okay.

1151
00:51:44,930 --> 00:51:46,490
That's interesting.
From the grassy knoll.

1152
00:51:46,491 --> 00:51:47,750
No,
there's no shot from the grassy knoll.

1153
00:51:47,751 --> 00:51:49,010
It's impossible.
Anyone's been a dealer.

1154
00:51:49,011 --> 00:51:51,230
Plaza realizes that's a physical 
impossibility.

1155
00:51:51,380 --> 00:51:52,213
All that stuff.
It does appear very clearly that oswald 

1156
00:51:54,471 --> 00:51:56,210
fire,
those bullets hit the traffic light.

1157
00:51:56,480 --> 00:51:59,440
Then he hit kennedy in the neck.
Then he had kennedy and the dha.

1158
00:51:59,510 --> 00:52:00,343
The magic bullet.
That's very easy to see with a heavy 

1159
00:52:02,451 --> 00:52:04,430
case bullet.
Full metal jacket.

1160
00:52:04,431 --> 00:52:05,750
Yeah.
That will act that way.

1161
00:52:05,870 --> 00:52:08,120
The ballistics aren't a question.
Oswald shot kennedy.

1162
00:52:09,110 --> 00:52:13,010
What was it like after the few weeks 
after the assassination?

1163
00:52:13,850 --> 00:52:16,370
Johnson was disoriented.
Um,

1164
00:52:16,660 --> 00:52:17,493
you know,
his staff of kennedy's people wanted to 

1165
00:52:18,681 --> 00:52:20,360
resign.
They didn't like johnson.

1166
00:52:20,900 --> 00:52:24,950
I'm the one thing he realized though,
is that,

1167
00:52:25,280 --> 00:52:26,840
uh,
I have to act to make,

1168
00:52:26,870 --> 00:52:31,190
to memorialize kennedy.
And the one specific step he took was he

1169
00:52:31,191 --> 00:52:32,720
told the senate,
guess what you're doing?

1170
00:52:32,960 --> 00:52:33,793
You're passing his tax cut right now,
which they did because he could 

1171
00:52:36,801 --> 00:52:37,760
intimidate the senate.

1172
00:52:38,150 --> 00:52:38,983
That gave us the tax cut of 1964 and 
then kennedy's promise was fulfilled in 

1173
00:52:42,141 --> 00:52:44,570
that five percent growth kept cruising 
through the sixties.

1174
00:52:45,200 --> 00:52:46,033
What waS the general,
even taking it away from the political 

1175
00:52:47,721 --> 00:52:50,180
side,
the general feeling in the country after

1176
00:52:50,181 --> 00:52:51,110
that?
Yeah.

1177
00:52:51,140 --> 00:52:53,740
Um,
this whole thing about lost innocence,

1178
00:52:53,820 --> 00:52:54,653
uh,
I was just in fort worth a couple of 

1179
00:52:55,391 --> 00:52:58,700
weeKs ago and I can't believe fort worth
and dallas have a big rivalry.

1180
00:52:58,701 --> 00:53:02,030
Fort worth thinks as much better than 
tantalus reds 30 miles away.

1181
00:53:02,660 --> 00:53:05,270
And uh,
everywhere in fort worth there are these

1182
00:53:05,271 --> 00:53:08,190
reminders of kennedy's last,
uh,

1183
00:53:08,270 --> 00:53:09,103
moments when America was innocent.
We're in fort worth and then he went to 

1184
00:53:12,291 --> 00:53:14,220
dallas where he was killed.
Um,

1185
00:53:14,300 --> 00:53:18,170
so that myth of american innocence is 
perpetuated.

1186
00:53:18,171 --> 00:53:23,060
I don't think it's particularly a,
makes a lOt of sense in terms of.

1187
00:53:23,990 --> 00:53:24,823
First of all,
kennedy was killed because he was 

1188
00:53:26,170 --> 00:53:27,300
anticommunist.

1189
00:53:28,080 --> 00:53:30,360
So I know the narrative makes sense on 
that grounds too.

1190
00:53:30,900 --> 00:53:32,250
And I mean,
look,

1191
00:53:32,320 --> 00:53:33,153
the civil rights movement,
which was a great benefit to the United 

1192
00:53:36,540 --> 00:53:37,373
States,
will then push through and flourished 

1193
00:53:38,790 --> 00:53:39,623
after 1963.
So that kind of lost innocence I've 

1194
00:53:41,941 --> 00:53:42,774
never quite understood.
So basically the three markers really 

1195
00:53:45,860 --> 00:53:48,870
are the economic stuff,
the tax guides,

1196
00:53:49,160 --> 00:53:52,140
the civil rights stuff,
and the cuban missile crisis.

1197
00:53:52,170 --> 00:53:54,900
Is there anything else we're missing in 
there that that's important?

1198
00:53:55,100 --> 00:53:56,280
Well,
the Vietnam,

1199
00:53:56,330 --> 00:53:59,460
I mean,
kennedy would have never let Vietnam be.

1200
00:53:59,461 --> 00:54:02,340
The disaster was.
He would have never let that happen.

1201
00:54:02,341 --> 00:54:06,150
So oliver stone is completely wrong.
That,

1202
00:54:06,310 --> 00:54:07,820
uh,
you know,

1203
00:54:07,890 --> 00:54:09,900
that kenny was killed by right wingers 
who,

1204
00:54:09,901 --> 00:54:12,510
one of the Vietnam war.
But uh,

1205
00:54:12,540 --> 00:54:13,373
it is,
I think in escapable to conclude that 

1206
00:54:15,481 --> 00:54:18,480
kennedy would not have presided over the
Vietnam wars like johnson did.

1207
00:54:18,660 --> 00:54:19,493
yeah.
I'm curious as a historian and someone 

1208
00:54:21,001 --> 00:54:24,300
that deeply cares about this stuff,
when you see all of these movies,

1209
00:54:24,301 --> 00:54:27,110
I mean we make everything into movies 
now rather jfk and there's lincoln,

1210
00:54:27,510 --> 00:54:30,560
everything now there's like 18 winston 
churchill stuff.

1211
00:54:30,960 --> 00:54:33,690
How much does that concern you?
Like at some level it's great.

1212
00:54:33,870 --> 00:54:36,570
people are getting basic ideas about 
this stuff.

1213
00:54:36,780 --> 00:54:39,780
But then in the case of the jfk movie,
which I really loved by the way,

1214
00:54:39,781 --> 00:54:40,920
and I can,
as you can see,

1215
00:54:40,921 --> 00:54:44,280
I can play those conspiracy games,
but that it also is hinting at,

1216
00:54:44,281 --> 00:54:45,910
you know,
there's a real implication that,

1217
00:54:45,911 --> 00:54:46,744
that johnson maybe had something to do 
with it in the jfk movie and read all 

1218
00:54:50,071 --> 00:54:50,904
that stuff.
So how much does that worry you that we 

1219
00:54:52,111 --> 00:54:52,944
get all of our information now from 
movies and documentaries and all that 

1220
00:54:57,120 --> 00:55:00,960
history is cult like having a history 
originated in the stone age,

1221
00:55:00,961 --> 00:55:03,060
around campfires.
Tell me stories about them.

1222
00:55:03,061 --> 00:55:06,490
And it's not a closeted academic 
subject.

1223
00:55:06,500 --> 00:55:08,400
I mean,
academics have a lot to say,

1224
00:55:08,401 --> 00:55:10,200
but there has to be very,
you know,

1225
00:55:10,400 --> 00:55:12,750
good interaction,
healthy interaction between all of these

1226
00:55:12,751 --> 00:55:14,370
kinds of so called vulgar forms of 
history,

1227
00:55:14,371 --> 00:55:16,310
which are wonderful,
uh,

1228
00:55:16,380 --> 00:55:18,180
better in certain ways and academic 
history.

1229
00:55:18,720 --> 00:55:19,553
Um,
I just thought all of a sudden it's 

1230
00:55:20,341 --> 00:55:21,210
great movie maker.
I mean,

1231
00:55:21,211 --> 00:55:23,730
I love his movies and platoon is 
incredible movie the others.

1232
00:55:25,020 --> 00:55:27,320
But he has an ax to grind about Vietnam.
I mean,

1233
00:55:27,370 --> 00:55:30,870
it was the capitalist who gave it to us.
It was the right to gave it to us,

1234
00:55:31,410 --> 00:55:32,243
know if you kept the anticommunist 
presidents and you've got to realize he 

1235
00:55:35,631 --> 00:55:36,464
was anticommunist.
He would have realized how to deal with 

1236
00:55:38,821 --> 00:55:40,200
that crisis.
Hmm.

1237
00:55:40,560 --> 00:55:42,210
Alright.
So to wrap this all up,

1238
00:55:42,211 --> 00:55:44,790
I thought that the right way to end this
would be.

1239
00:55:45,420 --> 00:55:49,230
We've talked a little bit about the sort
of modern day context and the modern day

1240
00:55:49,231 --> 00:55:50,064
lens on some of this stuff and you've 
referenced how sort of the parties have 

1241
00:55:52,111 --> 00:55:52,944
kind of flipped some of the things that 
jfk was saying then would not be things 

1242
00:55:56,430 --> 00:55:58,110
that democrats would say.
Now,

1243
00:55:58,440 --> 00:55:59,273
what do you think his political 
alignments would be these days if John 

1244
00:56:04,650 --> 00:56:05,550
F.
Kennedy had lived?

1245
00:56:05,940 --> 00:56:08,460
I don't think the democratic party would
have flipped.

1246
00:56:08,490 --> 00:56:10,620
So let's say John F.
Kennedy has two term presidency.

1247
00:56:10,630 --> 00:56:12,300
Somehow we don't really have Vietnam 
war.

1248
00:56:12,301 --> 00:56:15,030
He is ex president,
1969.

1249
00:56:15,410 --> 00:56:17,340
Um,
to the democrats spend the next 20,

1250
00:56:17,341 --> 00:56:18,174
30 years saying that kennedy tax cut had
nothing to do with cutting the top 

1251
00:56:21,361 --> 00:56:22,080
right.
No.

1252
00:56:22,080 --> 00:56:25,630
He would've been forced discipline on 
that conversation in the democrats would

1253
00:56:25,631 --> 00:56:28,630
have been born along as the party of tax
cuts.

1254
00:56:28,631 --> 00:56:32,080
So that investment flows into the real 
world and there are lots of jobs for the

1255
00:56:32,081 --> 00:56:33,460
regular guy.
So no,

1256
00:56:33,461 --> 00:56:36,790
I think that the democratic party would 
have been a lot different than if he had

1257
00:56:36,791 --> 00:56:37,331
lived.
Wow.

1258
00:56:37,331 --> 00:56:40,000
so,
so he really was the lay's.

1259
00:56:40,060 --> 00:56:42,760
is it fair to say then you think that he
was sort of the last,

1260
00:56:43,060 --> 00:56:47,920
somewhat small democrat,
small government democrat at some level?

1261
00:56:47,950 --> 00:56:48,783
yeah.
I think what happened is that the left 

1262
00:56:49,901 --> 00:56:50,734
took advantage of the assassination 
because kennedy wasn't around to defend 

1263
00:56:53,411 --> 00:56:56,260
himself specifically because of the 
assassination.

1264
00:56:56,260 --> 00:56:57,460
The left said,
aha,

1265
00:56:57,550 --> 00:57:00,310
we can misrepresent his record,
we can hold him high,

1266
00:57:00,330 --> 00:57:04,570
some kind of Big government liberal.
And then he became that and caroline and

1267
00:57:04,571 --> 00:57:05,404
john john.
We're kind of enough to go along with 

1268
00:57:07,391 --> 00:57:11,620
that ted certainly.
And that became the icon of John F.

1269
00:57:11,620 --> 00:57:12,453
Kennedy.
John kennedy himself would have never 

1270
00:57:13,181 --> 00:57:15,700
let that happen.
So I'm trying to place where he would be

1271
00:57:15,701 --> 00:57:16,840
at right now.
And I'm guessing.

1272
00:57:16,870 --> 00:57:19,360
sorry.
So if he was basically for tax cuts,

1273
00:57:19,900 --> 00:57:20,733
he believed in a strong military at some
level because he was fighting communism 

1274
00:57:23,830 --> 00:57:27,700
yet also at all these issues with the 
military and industrial complex.

1275
00:57:28,070 --> 00:57:28,903
I'm trying to figure out what,
how would you frame that type of 

1276
00:57:30,911 --> 00:57:34,390
political person these days?
It's like sort of libertarian,

1277
00:57:34,391 --> 00:57:37,330
but then with a little bit of a neo-con 
yeah.

1278
00:57:37,331 --> 00:57:38,164
Well these days would be very different.
I don't even thinK we would have had 

1279
00:57:40,241 --> 00:57:45,241
bill clinton because kennedy would have 
been around to be the elder party leader

1280
00:57:45,700 --> 00:57:46,533
and people wouldn't have been able to 
get away with a lot of the 

1281
00:57:48,401 --> 00:57:49,234
misrepresentation that they have in 
order to make the modern democratic 

1282
00:57:52,241 --> 00:57:52,720
party.

1283
00:57:52,720 --> 00:57:53,553
That's interesting.
So the assassination and then 

1284
00:57:54,851 --> 00:57:55,684
subsequently the whole family sort of 
falling apart and Robert Kennedy and 

1285
00:57:57,871 --> 00:58:00,700
everything else and I mean that really 
did set it,

1286
00:58:00,701 --> 00:58:03,610
set the nation in a strange way,
but it really did something crazy to the

1287
00:58:03,611 --> 00:58:06,760
democratic party inherently because it's
holding machine.

1288
00:58:06,761 --> 00:58:07,750
Yeah,
sorT of.

1289
00:58:07,870 --> 00:58:08,920
You mentioned rfk.
Yeah.

1290
00:58:08,950 --> 00:58:13,940
Rfk probably was going to have another 
marginal tax cut a.

1291
00:58:13,960 --> 00:58:14,793
Then he's blown away in 1968.
Ted kennedy continue to talk about tax 

1292
00:58:18,251 --> 00:58:19,084
cuts through the mid seventies and then 
only in 1980 became this kind of big 

1293
00:58:22,871 --> 00:58:24,880
status,
a government type.

1294
00:58:25,390 --> 00:58:27,460
So yeah,
we could have.

1295
00:58:27,520 --> 00:58:29,830
It could have been a lot different if 
the kennedy boys had lived.

1296
00:58:29,920 --> 00:58:30,753
Yeah.
Do you think we're done with the 

1297
00:58:31,181 --> 00:58:33,660
dynasties?
I mean it seems to be now that you know,

1298
00:58:33,850 --> 00:58:34,683
hillary lost,
so it seems like perhaps we've had our 

1299
00:58:36,281 --> 00:58:37,114
last clinton,
although I'm sure chelsea is going to 

1300
00:58:38,711 --> 00:58:40,580
run for senator from New York or 
something like that.

1301
00:58:40,950 --> 00:58:41,783
You know,
the bush family really after jeb did so 

1302
00:58:43,151 --> 00:58:44,800
horribly.
It seems like that might be done.

1303
00:58:44,801 --> 00:58:47,860
Although George Bush down in Texas,
maybe we'll do something.

1304
00:58:48,550 --> 00:58:52,780
Maybe trump iS goIng to step aside and 
let ivanka run next time or who knows,

1305
00:58:52,990 --> 00:58:57,400
but I sense that the dynasty thing 
really has people's sort of exhaustion,

1306
00:58:57,420 --> 00:58:58,253
you know,
with families that have this much power 

1307
00:59:00,580 --> 00:59:05,580
really has reached a peak and that would
seem to be a celebrity as phenomenon.

1308
00:59:06,370 --> 00:59:08,860
I think again,
the assassination is at fault here.

1309
00:59:09,310 --> 00:59:11,500
If John F.
Kennedy had had two full terms,

1310
00:59:11,501 --> 00:59:12,334
would the nation have felt the 
obligation to find out about all these 

1311
00:59:15,251 --> 00:59:16,870
other kennedy's?
Probably not,

1312
00:59:16,900 --> 00:59:19,690
but the cutting short of that political 
career,

1313
00:59:19,930 --> 00:59:21,980
I think is what gave life to all these

1314
00:59:21,980 --> 00:59:24,320
other kennedy's running for office.
Wow.

1315
00:59:24,470 --> 00:59:25,970
It's fascinating stuff.
Well,

1316
00:59:25,971 --> 00:59:26,804
I've thoroughly enjoyed this.
We're going to put the link to your 

1317
00:59:27,861 --> 00:59:29,780
book.
Write down below.

1318
00:59:29,781 --> 00:59:32,840
So for more on jfk,
his life and legacy checkout.

1319
00:59:32,841 --> 00:59:34,010
Brian's book,
jfk,

1320
00:59:34,011 --> 00:59:37,610
and the reagan revolution,
a secret history of american prosperity,

1321
00:59:37,611 --> 00:59:39,500
which again,
we're going to link to write down below.
