1
00:00:05,050 --> 00:00:05,883
Joining me as an evolutionary biologist,
formerly of Evergreen State University 

2
00:00:09,851 --> 00:00:13,270
who is now a professional professor in 
exile,

3
00:00:13,540 --> 00:00:15,100
Heather.
Hi and welcome to the Rubin report.

4
00:00:15,130 --> 00:00:17,980
Thank you for having today's professor 
in exile.

5
00:00:17,981 --> 00:00:21,250
I believe that is in your twitter bio.
It is.

6
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:24,340
I believe it is in your husband,
Bret Weinstein's twitter bio.

7
00:00:24,370 --> 00:00:26,050
Yeah.
We generated it together.

8
00:00:26,170 --> 00:00:29,710
Is that going to be the title of the Co 
authored a book when the dust settles on

9
00:00:29,711 --> 00:00:30,544
all of this stuff?

10
00:00:30,630 --> 00:00:31,463
Oh,
I don't know.

11
00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:37,350
I think both of us are both eager to 
leave the evergreen story behind,

12
00:00:37,410 --> 00:00:38,243
but still heartbroken that an 
institution that we loved and still 

13
00:00:42,781 --> 00:00:43,614
believe in the educational model that it
offered and still believe in the 

14
00:00:47,461 --> 00:00:51,180
students who got great education was 
there for many decades.

15
00:00:52,710 --> 00:00:53,543
We would love to see it resurrected,
but it doesn't look like it's going to 

16
00:00:56,091 --> 00:00:56,680
happen.

17
00:00:56,680 --> 00:00:57,401
Yeah.
All right,

18
00:00:57,401 --> 00:00:58,234
so this is.
It's a little crazy to me that this is 

19
00:00:59,381 --> 00:01:01,810
the first time that we've met because 
obviously our,

20
00:01:01,830 --> 00:01:02,663
our circles have been sort of a closing 
in on each other for for quite some 

21
00:01:06,551 --> 00:01:07,384
time.
So when,

22
00:01:07,410 --> 00:01:09,940
when the whole evergreen thing happened 
and I only want to spend a little bit of

23
00:01:09,941 --> 00:01:10,774
time at the top talking about it and 
then I want to do all sorts of 

24
00:01:12,671 --> 00:01:14,180
evolutionary biology stuff and the 
other,

25
00:01:14,350 --> 00:01:16,000
the other things that you're really 
passionate about,

26
00:01:16,510 --> 00:01:17,343
the story,
obviously it was more focused on Brett 

27
00:01:19,331 --> 00:01:21,730
and then he was sort of thrust into the 
media and all that,

28
00:01:21,940 --> 00:01:26,110
but this was a direct attack on you as 
well in the end,

29
00:01:26,111 --> 00:01:26,944
as you said,
the institution that you loved and all 

30
00:01:27,911 --> 00:01:28,744
that.
Can you just give me any sort of recap 

31
00:01:31,420 --> 00:01:32,253
or just pieces of it that maybe we don't
know that well or just your perspective 

32
00:01:35,111 --> 00:01:36,010
on what was happening there?

33
00:01:36,550 --> 00:01:37,383
Well,
um,

34
00:01:38,090 --> 00:01:39,640
as,
as briefly as I can,

35
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,400
leaving out many,
many relevant pieces,

36
00:01:43,300 --> 00:01:44,133
we got a new president and the new 
president very quickly got rid of a 

37
00:01:48,311 --> 00:01:49,144
provost who was going to get in his way 
and spoke publicly about his desire to 

38
00:01:54,701 --> 00:01:56,860
turn evergreen into a social justice 
college.

39
00:01:57,130 --> 00:02:02,130
I was actually on the record early in 
George Church's tenure at the point that

40
00:02:02,321 --> 00:02:05,230
the protests broke out a year ago.
Now,

41
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:07,013
uh,
he had been president for about two 

42
00:02:08,141 --> 00:02:12,040
years and a year before that had broken 
out in equity,

43
00:02:12,490 --> 00:02:13,300
uh,
uh,

44
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:16,960
a desire to bring equity and inclusion 
to the forefront,

45
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:18,920
which is,
which is cohorts.

46
00:02:18,940 --> 00:02:19,773
It's dog whistles for the people on the 
far left who are actually interested in 

47
00:02:23,921 --> 00:02:26,620
a reversal of power,
not an end to oppression,

48
00:02:26,621 --> 00:02:30,070
but an actual reversal of historical 
oppression.

49
00:02:30,260 --> 00:02:33,470
Did you guys recognize those things as 
dog whistles at the time?

50
00:02:33,471 --> 00:02:36,980
Because as Brett said,
at the time he considers himself,

51
00:02:36,981 --> 00:02:39,680
or at least at that time did consider 
himself deeply progressive.

52
00:02:39,681 --> 00:02:41,030
You just said to me right before we 
started,

53
00:02:41,210 --> 00:02:43,340
you still consider yourself progressive.
Yep.

54
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:47,480
So did you realize those buzzwords and 
what they actually meant at the time?

55
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:48,870
Absolutely.
I mean,

56
00:02:48,871 --> 00:02:49,704
Brett,
actually I was on sabbatical the year 

57
00:02:51,420 --> 00:02:52,253
most of the year before this breakout is
part of why I was disappeared from the 

58
00:02:55,021 --> 00:02:55,854
story I said as I went on to sabbatical,
but I will continue to read everything 

59
00:03:00,050 --> 00:03:02,790
you want to send out to these lists,
but I'm not engaging.

60
00:03:02,820 --> 00:03:07,720
I'm doing my own work now.
So about a year,

61
00:03:07,721 --> 00:03:09,970
actually a year to the day before the 
protest broke out,

62
00:03:10,210 --> 00:03:12,940
the first announcement of the new plan 
came,

63
00:03:13,300 --> 00:03:14,980
came live,
and then,

64
00:03:14,981 --> 00:03:16,870
and there,
and for the next year,

65
00:03:17,050 --> 00:03:17,883
Brett was,
I was a little bit a couple of other 

66
00:03:19,301 --> 00:03:22,090
people were a little bit standing up and
saying,

67
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:24,220
this doesn't smell right.
This,

68
00:03:24,221 --> 00:03:28,450
this feels like this is actually about 
something that we're not talking about.

69
00:03:28,780 --> 00:03:29,613
And furthermore,
if we're actually interested in 

70
00:03:32,110 --> 00:03:35,620
improving the fate of various 
demographic groups,

71
00:03:36,010 --> 00:03:38,680
these processes are not going to be the 
way to accomplish them.

72
00:03:39,070 --> 00:03:39,903
So we were saying that Brett mostly was 
saying that a few others of us were 

73
00:03:43,481 --> 00:03:44,314
saying it.

74
00:03:44,530 --> 00:03:47,140
And um,
was there any,

75
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:48,033
um,
sort of understanding of that point of 

76
00:03:50,381 --> 00:03:52,990
view privately?
Yes.

77
00:03:53,230 --> 00:03:54,340
Privately,
yes.

78
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:55,473
People were scared and when in fact,
when Brett used the phrase culture of 

79
00:04:00,611 --> 00:04:01,444
fear on campus,
what came back at him was you have to 

80
00:04:06,161 --> 00:04:08,560
prove that there's a culture of fear or 
else there's not one.

81
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:10,353
And you know,
show me the people who aren't standing 

82
00:04:11,711 --> 00:04:14,020
up or else I will know that they don't 
exist,

83
00:04:14,260 --> 00:04:17,150
which is baffling.
It's,

84
00:04:17,210 --> 00:04:18,043
it is obviously unimprovable an 
unprovable statement to say there's a 

85
00:04:22,601 --> 00:04:23,434
culture of fear and I'm not going to out
the people who have come to me and told 

86
00:04:25,931 --> 00:04:29,260
me they're scared because I actually am 
going to honor their privacy,

87
00:04:29,620 --> 00:04:30,453
but if,
if everyone who would come to us 

88
00:04:32,381 --> 00:04:36,480
privately and said,
this is nuts and it's got to stop,

89
00:04:36,670 --> 00:04:37,503
had stood up,
it would have been a totally different 

90
00:04:38,921 --> 00:04:39,754
outcome.

91
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,040
Well that's the culture of fear summed 
up right there.

92
00:04:42,041 --> 00:04:43,120
Right.
So,

93
00:04:43,170 --> 00:04:43,511
um,
okay.

94
00:04:43,511 --> 00:04:45,440
So without rehashing the whole thing,
can you just tell me a little,

95
00:04:45,460 --> 00:04:46,293
just a little bit about sort of how your
life has changed throughout this and 

96
00:04:49,031 --> 00:04:49,601
sort of,
you know,

97
00:04:49,601 --> 00:04:50,381
look,
you and Brett,

98
00:04:50,381 --> 00:04:53,350
you guys did settle.
It wasn't for a ton of money,

99
00:04:53,351 --> 00:04:56,500
at least in my humble estimation,
but I think you probably want it to just

100
00:04:56,740 --> 00:04:59,380
put some of this behind you,
but you guys are professors in exile you

101
00:04:59,381 --> 00:05:00,214
if you have kids and family and all that
stuff and just sort of sum up kind of 

102
00:05:02,801 --> 00:05:03,634
where you're at at the moment.

103
00:05:03,710 --> 00:05:04,760
Yeah.
So when we had,

104
00:05:05,090 --> 00:05:07,280
we'd been living in Olympia for 15 
years.

105
00:05:07,390 --> 00:05:09,370
Um,
the,

106
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:10,393
the college was an amazing place to 
really do a deep dive in community with 

107
00:05:14,061 --> 00:05:15,390
students.
And so you know,

108
00:05:15,490 --> 00:05:16,323
Brad and I had done one and I had done 
several long study abroad trips and 

109
00:05:19,701 --> 00:05:20,534
Panama and in Ecuador with pretty large 
groups of undergraduates taking them 

110
00:05:24,261 --> 00:05:25,910
through the Amazon.
They're galapagos.

111
00:05:25,911 --> 00:05:28,340
We spent time in the field in Washington
state,

112
00:05:28,341 --> 00:05:33,050
in the San Juans and eastern Washington.
You're took people places where not only

113
00:05:33,051 --> 00:05:37,430
were we studying evolutionary biology 
and animal behavior and field techniques

114
00:05:37,431 --> 00:05:39,290
and Statistics and philosophy of 
science,

115
00:05:39,770 --> 00:05:43,570
but also coming to know each other such 
that after,

116
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:48,030
after you break bread with people for 
days and you play ultimate with them and

117
00:05:48,050 --> 00:05:48,883
sit around a campfire,
you come to understand that when they 

118
00:05:52,491 --> 00:05:53,324
disagree with you,
it's not inherently coming from a place 

119
00:05:55,551 --> 00:05:56,840
of hatred or personal.

120
00:05:57,980 --> 00:06:02,390
And so that trust that we were able to 
create in our classrooms,

121
00:06:02,391 --> 00:06:03,224
which both of us love to doing,
allowed us to effectively then rip the 

122
00:06:07,611 --> 00:06:08,444
intellectual rug out from under people 
when they made claims that weren't 

123
00:06:11,030 --> 00:06:11,863
falsifiable or couldn't be.
You couldn't be justified once you 

124
00:06:14,991 --> 00:06:18,020
started to ask them what the assumptions
were there underlying their claims.

125
00:06:18,290 --> 00:06:20,780
That was,
that was an amazing gift.

126
00:06:20,781 --> 00:06:24,500
And I don't know that really almost any 
other educational model out there allows

127
00:06:24,501 --> 00:06:28,340
for that because it required the time to
build community with students,

128
00:06:28,670 --> 00:06:30,170
which was,
which was wonderful.

129
00:06:30,171 --> 00:06:33,190
So yes,
we lost two tenure track jobs along with

130
00:06:33,191 --> 00:06:34,024
your health insurance and our retirement
plans and all of that and have two kids 

131
00:06:36,531 --> 00:06:38,900
still in school.
So that's alarming.

132
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:44,330
But some of what we were doing in the 
classroom,

133
00:06:44,331 --> 00:06:48,200
we have begun to do on larger stages.
And that is promising.

134
00:06:48,650 --> 00:06:49,483
It seems clear that the world is 
interested in hearing how to understand 

135
00:06:53,361 --> 00:06:55,280
systems from an evolutionary 
perspective.

136
00:06:55,670 --> 00:06:56,503
I knew that was true from the 25 or 50 
students that I had doing the deep dive 

137
00:07:00,710 --> 00:07:01,250
for,
you know,

138
00:07:01,250 --> 00:07:03,080
every quarter,
every year for years.

139
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:05,000
Uh,
it's not that surprising,

140
00:07:05,001 --> 00:07:08,210
but it is heartening to see that that is
the response of many,

141
00:07:08,211 --> 00:07:09,140
many people out there

142
00:07:09,210 --> 00:07:12,720
in a weird way.
Does it almost feel right then that this

143
00:07:12,721 --> 00:07:13,531
happened?
I mean,

144
00:07:13,531 --> 00:07:14,364
I know it's kind of sucky and again with
the salaries in tenure track positions 

145
00:07:16,891 --> 00:07:17,724
and all that,
but that the message that you guys are 

146
00:07:19,771 --> 00:07:22,350
talking about seems so relevant right 
now.

147
00:07:22,351 --> 00:07:24,720
You guys are now doing more public 
speaking gigs.

148
00:07:24,721 --> 00:07:27,120
I'm,
I'm dragging bread onstage with me to do

149
00:07:27,121 --> 00:07:27,954
stand up.
I mean all sorts of crazy things are 

150
00:07:29,851 --> 00:07:30,684
presenting themselves and then the sort 
of the rise of this new alliance of 

151
00:07:34,710 --> 00:07:37,650
whether you want to call it intellectual
dark web or whatever you want to call it

152
00:07:37,651 --> 00:07:38,560
at this point,
but there,

153
00:07:38,570 --> 00:07:39,403
there is this sort of interesting crew 
of people with a lot of different 

154
00:07:42,151 --> 00:07:42,984
feelings on a lot of different issues 
with all sorts of different disciplines 

155
00:07:45,691 --> 00:07:46,524
coming together.
And maybe if you guys were still at 

156
00:07:48,361 --> 00:07:49,194
university in a traditional sense,
you wouldn't be able to be dealt in the 

157
00:07:52,021 --> 00:07:52,650
way that

158
00:07:52,650 --> 00:07:54,540
you are now.
I think that's possible.

159
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:59,600
I think there is both a way in which 
having gone through the looking glass,

160
00:07:59,671 --> 00:08:01,980
having gone through the direct,
you know,

161
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:02,873
to borrow a phrase from the far left,
but the lived experience of actually 

162
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:11,720
being at the center of a mob at the 
center of riots and then watching as the

163
00:08:12,871 --> 00:08:16,560
world,
the mainstream media and others tried to

164
00:08:16,590 --> 00:08:17,423
do a public relations spin on it and 
tell a totally different story to live 

165
00:08:21,481 --> 00:08:22,314
that and to watch the institution that 
you love to become totally disloyal to 

166
00:08:25,201 --> 00:08:28,530
you and to watch many people whom you 
respected,

167
00:08:28,890 --> 00:08:30,120
um,
hide.

168
00:08:31,590 --> 00:08:32,423
You can't unsee that it's valuable.
And the fact that we're sitting here 

169
00:08:35,341 --> 00:08:39,030
talking together and that many of us and
you know the intellectual,

170
00:08:39,031 --> 00:08:42,330
dark web and in this,
in this bigger group are,

171
00:08:42,540 --> 00:08:43,373
are speaking and saying actually the 
culture of fear that is society wide is 

172
00:08:47,491 --> 00:08:48,324
real.

173
00:08:48,540 --> 00:08:49,373
And so I'll say the first time I met my 
students after the November 2016 

174
00:08:54,451 --> 00:08:57,410
election after trump was elected,
evergreen,

175
00:08:57,430 --> 00:09:00,420
so very left place,
Olympia is a very left place.

176
00:09:00,660 --> 00:09:03,360
Pretty much everyone on campus had that 
glazed eyes.

177
00:09:03,361 --> 00:09:04,194
Slack,
Jawed Lux that people in most 

178
00:09:05,521 --> 00:09:08,340
progressive enclaves will be familiar 
with from that time,

179
00:09:08,341 --> 00:09:09,450
from those few days,
right.

180
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:12,990
Myself included,
even though I was no hillary fan,

181
00:09:12,991 --> 00:09:15,840
but I didn't see that outcome coming and
I certainly didn't vote for trump.

182
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:17,933
I,
um,

183
00:09:20,610 --> 00:09:23,700
we got to class and my co faculty,
whom I admired greatly,

184
00:09:23,990 --> 00:09:24,823
I just proceeded with her lecture on 
horse evolution and I'm looking around 

185
00:09:27,961 --> 00:09:28,794
the classroom going,
no one here cares about horses the day 

186
00:09:33,550 --> 00:09:34,800
to day.
Um,

187
00:09:35,190 --> 00:09:36,023
so she ended up at early and we had lab 
a couple of hours later and before she 

188
00:09:40,921 --> 00:09:41,790
let them go,
I said,

189
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:43,290
hold on,
if anyone wants to stay,

190
00:09:43,291 --> 00:09:45,390
this is no longer class,
but if anyone wants to stay,

191
00:09:45,780 --> 00:09:48,390
I would be happy to lead a conversation 
about what just happened,

192
00:09:48,780 --> 00:09:49,980
what just happened to our country.

193
00:09:50,580 --> 00:09:54,730
And about 40 of our 50 students stayed 
and skip their lunch hour.

194
00:09:54,750 --> 00:09:56,880
And then we went right to anatomy lab 
that afternoon from,

195
00:09:56,910 --> 00:10:00,210
from this conversation.
And what I said to them was,

196
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:04,080
do not for a minute believe that racists
and sexist elected trump.

197
00:10:04,740 --> 00:10:05,573
Think about how many times you have had 
to censor yourself on this campus when 

198
00:10:09,061 --> 00:10:09,894
you had an opinion that was even 
slightly different from the accepted 

199
00:10:13,681 --> 00:10:18,681
Dogma and that conversation not only 
brought life to the realm,

200
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:21,930
but afterwards I had several students 
come up to me,

201
00:10:21,931 --> 00:10:22,764
some of them in tears telling me stories
about one of them had lost a job on 

202
00:10:26,311 --> 00:10:30,240
campus for speaking in opinion that was 
not accepted.

203
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:33,330
One of them had an another story of 
another friend who lost a job.

204
00:10:33,570 --> 00:10:38,570
Others talked about their self 
censorship and I'm that and all of these

205
00:10:39,421 --> 00:10:42,240
people again were four left.
Not that it should matter,

206
00:10:42,241 --> 00:10:43,074
but these weren't even people who are 
conservatives or who held conservative 

207
00:10:45,631 --> 00:10:46,464
views so that that is the larger culture
of fear that is hardly restricted to 

208
00:10:51,781 --> 00:10:54,330
evergreen,
but is society wide that we're,

209
00:10:54,540 --> 00:10:55,373
that we're speaking about and that 
people are responding to because in at 

210
00:10:59,490 --> 00:11:01,560
Google,
at starbucks,

211
00:11:02,110 --> 00:11:04,530
in cubicles,
in campuses,

212
00:11:04,531 --> 00:11:05,364
but far be on campuses across the 
country and across the weird country is 

213
00:11:08,491 --> 00:11:10,380
at least this is a problem.
Well,

214
00:11:10,381 --> 00:11:10,990
the irony too

215
00:11:10,990 --> 00:11:11,823
me is that I think that all that I'm 
doing is talking about these things 

216
00:11:14,501 --> 00:11:17,890
often with people who have a much better
pedigree than I do,

217
00:11:18,100 --> 00:11:18,933
but by me talking about it,
it's giving room for other people to 

218
00:11:22,031 --> 00:11:23,500
talk about it and that's all that they 
want.

219
00:11:23,950 --> 00:11:24,480
Well,
you're,

220
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:25,690
you're,
you are also so

221
00:11:25,690 --> 00:11:29,470
providing ways into the conversation.
I think so.

222
00:11:29,471 --> 00:11:31,810
There are a lot of people when 
confronted with.

223
00:11:31,811 --> 00:11:34,960
You're not allowed to think that say,
Oh God,

224
00:11:34,961 --> 00:11:37,180
I'm not actually sure how to respond.
I haven't.

225
00:11:37,210 --> 00:11:38,500
I don't know.
I don't,

226
00:11:38,940 --> 00:11:42,790
I don't have the linguistic skills.
I don't have the analytics behind me.

227
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,620
I don't know what I'm supposed to say 
here.

228
00:11:44,621 --> 00:11:45,454
And so just listening to you and to Sam 
Harris and the Jordan Peterson into 

229
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:49,673
Brett and to Eric and to me and to many,
many others I believe begins to give 

230
00:11:55,211 --> 00:11:57,010
people a sense of not only is this 
doable,

231
00:11:57,011 --> 00:11:58,930
these are good,
reasonable,

232
00:11:58,931 --> 00:12:01,390
smart people who are being respectful in
what they're saying,

233
00:12:01,630 --> 00:12:05,060
but also it's not just tools.
It's actually like phrase it,

234
00:12:05,510 --> 00:12:07,330
you know,
this is what you can say.

235
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:08,313
These are the things that sort of things
that you can say in response that are 

236
00:12:11,230 --> 00:12:12,063
still respectful and don't reject the 
humanity of the person on the other 

237
00:12:14,351 --> 00:12:16,450
side,
but do reject the argument.

238
00:12:16,690 --> 00:12:18,340
It's interesting.
It almost shows that

239
00:12:19,110 --> 00:12:22,110
were you guys obviously were doing so 
well at a university level.

240
00:12:22,111 --> 00:12:24,540
That's exactly what's needed at a 
societal level.

241
00:12:24,541 --> 00:12:25,374
Now talking about the language,
the language to get these ideas across 

242
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:29,953
is is so important.
I wonder is there a evolutionary 

243
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:37,710
explanation for a little bit of what has
happened here with the left,

244
00:12:37,711 --> 00:12:38,544
like the way they've sort of closed off 
ranks and then purge everyone because 

245
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:42,433
it's just as I sit here with you,
it's like the idea that you and Brett 

246
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:46,193
wouldn't be enough of whatever it is 
that they want is so bananas and yet it 

247
00:12:50,701 --> 00:12:51,534
is true.

248
00:12:51,790 --> 00:12:52,623
So is there some way that you can 
explain that coming from the discipline 

249
00:12:54,731 --> 00:12:56,320
you come from?
Well there's.

250
00:12:57,070 --> 00:12:59,350
I think this is not going to be a 
particularly deep point,

251
00:12:59,351 --> 00:13:03,340
but it's,
it's basic ingroup outgroup dynamics and

252
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:04,233
we will always.
We will not get rid of of tribal 

253
00:13:06,671 --> 00:13:08,710
thinking.
We will not get rid of our sense of,

254
00:13:08,980 --> 00:13:10,780
you know,
you and I are aligned,

255
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:11,410
right?
That's,

256
00:13:11,410 --> 00:13:13,960
that's a good thing.
There's a way in which there's a kind of

257
00:13:13,961 --> 00:13:17,790
tribalism there even though we just met 
for the first time today and you know,

258
00:13:17,791 --> 00:13:20,530
and we definitely have political 
differences for sure.

259
00:13:20,531 --> 00:13:21,850
Which we can talk about if we want.
Yeah,

260
00:13:21,910 --> 00:13:22,743
right.
So,

261
00:13:22,750 --> 00:13:24,940
but,
but that isn't the main thing.

262
00:13:24,970 --> 00:13:27,070
Like we,
we're aligned and I,

263
00:13:27,071 --> 00:13:27,904
you know,
I feel walking in here like you've got 

264
00:13:29,291 --> 00:13:34,291
my back and you've got my back and um,
I think people especially raised without

265
00:13:38,411 --> 00:13:39,244
much experience with the physical world 
and raised often in situations where 

266
00:13:45,071 --> 00:13:45,904
they're being given a number of 
pharmaceuticals early on that are 

267
00:13:48,641 --> 00:13:49,474
disrupting development,
arrive at what should be the cusp of 

268
00:13:51,821 --> 00:13:55,690
adulthood and aren't sure how to 
navigate,

269
00:13:55,810 --> 00:13:57,220
aren't sure how to navigate the waters.

270
00:13:57,220 --> 00:13:59,410
And so when told,
Oh,

271
00:13:59,470 --> 00:14:03,490
if you just agree with everything,
if you just become an idea log and go in

272
00:14:03,491 --> 00:14:05,860
lock step with us,
you can be with us.

273
00:14:06,460 --> 00:14:07,293
So you know,
identity politics is appealing because 

274
00:14:08,981 --> 00:14:09,814
it provides an instant in group if you 
will only subjugate yourself and your 

275
00:14:13,380 --> 00:14:15,220
identity.
Politics on this side,

276
00:14:15,221 --> 00:14:17,170
b gets it.
Anti politics on this side of course,

277
00:14:17,171 --> 00:14:19,630
because anyone who shows up here and is 
told no,

278
00:14:19,810 --> 00:14:22,510
you don't have enough of what the 
progressive stack tells us you made,

279
00:14:22,690 --> 00:14:23,523
either you can totally subjugate 
yourself or go over there and we'll of 

280
00:14:25,121 --> 00:14:27,640
course we're going to get a rise over 
here and back and forth

281
00:14:27,790 --> 00:14:32,330
when people criticize us,
whoever this is for not focusing on that

282
00:14:32,331 --> 00:14:34,240
identity politics enough,
the one that,

283
00:14:34,270 --> 00:14:35,750
the secondary one that you're talking 
about here,

284
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:37,550
which is the identity politics of the 
right,

285
00:14:37,551 --> 00:14:40,550
which is either which is based in actual
racism or,

286
00:14:40,551 --> 00:14:41,384
or you know,
there's a white ethno state or ideas 

287
00:14:42,831 --> 00:14:43,664
that are.
So the antithesis of the American 

288
00:14:45,291 --> 00:14:49,250
experiment is to me they're,
they're ridiculous and have no real real

289
00:14:49,251 --> 00:14:50,084
world traction.
It's almost like we've this boogeyman 

290
00:14:51,980 --> 00:14:54,850
because we need it long since been 
displayed.

291
00:14:55,010 --> 00:14:55,860
No,
no.

292
00:14:56,060 --> 00:14:58,910
Almost no one thinks that way anymore.
Sorry.

293
00:14:59,060 --> 00:14:59,571
No.
Well,

294
00:14:59,571 --> 00:15:01,820
so what's your,
what's your best argument against that?

295
00:15:01,821 --> 00:15:02,271
When people say,
well,

296
00:15:02,271 --> 00:15:03,104
you're not focusing on that enough 
because because everyone wants 

297
00:15:05,031 --> 00:15:05,864
everything to be equal all the time.
If you're focusing on the identity 

298
00:15:07,431 --> 00:15:10,100
politics of the left,
which clearly many of us see as.

299
00:15:10,101 --> 00:15:11,390
I mean,
I truly see it.

300
00:15:11,420 --> 00:15:12,240
I've been saying,
listen,

301
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:13,073
I really believe this.
I view it as the greatest existential 

302
00:15:15,771 --> 00:15:19,220
threat to western democracy that there 
is.

303
00:15:19,221 --> 00:15:24,221
I believe that if there's something that
would cause us to be on the streets like

304
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:26,420
killing each other,
I think it's that we're.

305
00:15:26,421 --> 00:15:30,020
We'll have broken off and all of the 
commonalities will will disappear,

306
00:15:30,110 --> 00:15:30,943
but what?
What do you think is the best argument 

307
00:15:31,521 --> 00:15:32,354
for what?
You're not focusing on that one enough 

308
00:15:33,630 --> 00:15:35,090
because I see that a lot now,
right?

309
00:15:35,190 --> 00:15:36,420
I think.
I think two things.

310
00:15:36,450 --> 00:15:38,880
One,
it's not as big a group,

311
00:15:39,450 --> 00:15:39,981
right?
The,

312
00:15:39,981 --> 00:15:40,814
the white nationalists,
the extent that they exist and they do 

313
00:15:43,740 --> 00:15:46,770
are better armed by and large than than 
the far left,

314
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:52,280
but numerically they just don't exist in
the same numbers and they don't have the

315
00:15:53,011 --> 00:15:53,844
kind of play.
They don't have the kind of cultural 

316
00:15:55,141 --> 00:15:57,990
reach that the far left does.
And so that's the second.

317
00:15:58,080 --> 00:15:59,520
Well,
I guess there's three points.

318
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:00,793
A secondary point then is everyone can 
walk white nationalists that is 

319
00:16:04,921 --> 00:16:08,880
completely acceptable and in fact 
demanded that you do when those sorts of

320
00:16:08,881 --> 00:16:12,480
ideas come up in conversation.
Whereas the stuff on the far left,

321
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:15,540
increasingly it is demanded that you 
not.

322
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:18,540
So there is,
that's the key right there.

323
00:16:18,780 --> 00:16:20,760
So like we are saying,
no,

324
00:16:20,761 --> 00:16:21,594
actually we must,
we must disagree with this just as much 

325
00:16:23,821 --> 00:16:24,630
as we should.

326
00:16:24,630 --> 00:16:25,463
Just as much as culturally we now know 
it's a norm to disagree with what's on 

327
00:16:28,081 --> 00:16:29,970
the right we,
the far right.

328
00:16:30,270 --> 00:16:34,770
It should become a cultural norm to 
disagree with frankly the cryptic racism

329
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:39,270
and sexism and everything else that's 
happening on the far left.

330
00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:40,373
It is,
it comes packaged as if it's anti 

331
00:16:42,451 --> 00:16:44,190
racist,
anti sexist and all,

332
00:16:44,310 --> 00:16:47,100
it's just,
it's racist and sexist against the other

333
00:16:47,101 --> 00:16:47,934
group.
It's a flipping of the tables of 

334
00:16:50,570 --> 00:16:53,250
oppression.
So I would say the third point is,

335
00:16:53,460 --> 00:16:54,293
for me anyway,
as someone who has been on the left my 

336
00:16:56,581 --> 00:16:58,020
whole life,
uh,

337
00:16:58,050 --> 00:16:58,883
this has changed,
this experience is going through the 

338
00:17:00,511 --> 00:17:03,630
looking glass in the last year has not 
changed my values,

339
00:17:03,900 --> 00:17:04,733
but it has changed what I understand 
about how people are using language to 

340
00:17:10,591 --> 00:17:12,840
make other people out to be things 
they're not.

341
00:17:13,320 --> 00:17:13,770
So,
you know,

342
00:17:13,770 --> 00:17:17,790
I no longer believe in a massive 
outright for instance.

343
00:17:18,150 --> 00:17:19,120
Right.
Um,

344
00:17:19,290 --> 00:17:20,123
and you know,
the boogeyman that are out there that 

345
00:17:21,301 --> 00:17:23,640
you're not supposed to do things like 
talk to Fox News.

346
00:17:23,990 --> 00:17:25,350
Sorry.
No,

347
00:17:25,410 --> 00:17:27,750
actually we should all be exposing 
ourselves to,

348
00:17:28,020 --> 00:17:32,190
to the media across the entire range.
And for me on the left,

349
00:17:32,370 --> 00:17:37,370
it's actually my job much more so than 
to go after people who I have nothing in

350
00:17:38,641 --> 00:17:42,330
common with,
to go after the people who claim to have

351
00:17:42,331 --> 00:17:43,164
values that are similar to mine.
But I see that they are actually 

352
00:17:45,331 --> 00:17:46,440
achieving goals that are different.

353
00:17:46,580 --> 00:17:47,413
Yeah.
And that's why I love this conversation 

354
00:17:48,921 --> 00:17:53,921
and don't get tired of it because we're 
all in on it at different levels.

355
00:17:54,061 --> 00:17:54,894
We all have different realizations at 
different times along the timeline and 

356
00:17:58,531 --> 00:18:01,110
it's like for me,
that's where I free for two years.

357
00:18:01,111 --> 00:18:04,590
I kept saying I'm of the left and that's
why I want to fix this.

358
00:18:04,591 --> 00:18:05,424
I don't think realistically anymore I 
can honestly say that I think I have 

359
00:18:08,491 --> 00:18:10,770
more in common certainly with 
Libertarians and I find it.

360
00:18:10,950 --> 00:18:11,783
I find an intellectual openness with 
conservatives that I just don't find 

361
00:18:14,910 --> 00:18:16,290
anymore.
On this other side,

362
00:18:16,291 --> 00:18:17,370
and I know there's.
Again,

363
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:19,560
I know there's some people you just 
spoke at Heterodox,

364
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:22,170
a Heterodox,
Jonathan hates been on the show.

365
00:18:22,171 --> 00:18:23,004
I think he's doing wonderful work.
There's obviously people like Brett and 

366
00:18:25,511 --> 00:18:26,344
like Eric and and Steven pinker and 
plenty and Sam and plenty of other that 

367
00:18:29,851 --> 00:18:30,684
exists still as sort of a same left,
but I see that just being whittled and 

368
00:18:35,101 --> 00:18:35,934
whittled and whittled away and that 
doesn't mean that it's not worth taking 

369
00:18:38,621 --> 00:18:39,454
it.
Maybe it means it's the most worthy 

370
00:18:40,410 --> 00:18:41,243
fight,
but I just see it as like an 

371
00:18:42,211 --> 00:18:44,970
increasingly untenable position to hold.

372
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:47,670
I think.
I think there are actually many,

373
00:18:47,671 --> 00:18:50,700
many,
many people out there who are not,

374
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:54,240
who don't have public platforms,
who are waiting,

375
00:18:54,390 --> 00:18:57,150
who've been waiting for this,
who are watching your.

376
00:18:57,151 --> 00:18:59,820
Most of these people would consider the 
songs themselves Democrats,

377
00:18:59,821 --> 00:19:02,040
as I always did.
I don't,

378
00:19:02,340 --> 00:19:05,220
I don't want to identify as a Democrat 
anymore given what they know,

379
00:19:05,221 --> 00:19:09,330
stand for a.
But most I think that and this,

380
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:11,310
you know,
as evidenced by my inbox.

381
00:19:11,430 --> 00:19:12,263
So it's anecdotal,
but it's a lot of anecdotes and you 

382
00:19:14,691 --> 00:19:15,524
know,
and also my twitter feed a that there 

383
00:19:17,911 --> 00:19:18,744
are a massive number of people out there
who are on the left who have values on 

384
00:19:22,411 --> 00:19:27,060
the left and who find no one out there 
who was making sense except now.

385
00:19:28,780 --> 00:19:30,780
Yeah.
And it,

386
00:19:30,890 --> 00:19:34,350
it has taken.
It has taken this to,

387
00:19:34,380 --> 00:19:38,340
you have this fever pitch that we have 
arrived at a for a number of people.

388
00:19:38,341 --> 00:19:42,690
I really think and like I said,
you know Google starbucks,

389
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:43,913
but it's not just those big stories.
There are people writing to me and to 

390
00:19:46,561 --> 00:19:50,460
Brett from just average workplaces 
saying,

391
00:19:51,270 --> 00:19:52,103
I'm in fear for my job because I cannot 
speak anything that doesn't fit the 

392
00:19:55,891 --> 00:19:58,860
dogma.
We just hired an equity advisor.

393
00:19:58,861 --> 00:20:01,290
We just hired an inclusion advisor and 
it's,

394
00:20:01,730 --> 00:20:02,563
and it's hateful.
It's hateful rhetoric that we are being 

395
00:20:04,471 --> 00:20:05,304
told to adopt.
This is what's happening across 

396
00:20:07,980 --> 00:20:08,813
corporate America now.
Of course most Americans are not going 

397
00:20:12,151 --> 00:20:13,020
to appreciate that.

398
00:20:13,210 --> 00:20:15,520
Yeah.
It's like it existed at the universities

399
00:20:15,521 --> 00:20:16,354
for a long time and finally it started 
bubbling out of there and those kids 

400
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:21,400
took those ideas and started entering 
the workforce.

401
00:20:21,401 --> 00:20:22,630
That's why it's so weird.
You know,

402
00:20:22,631 --> 00:20:23,464
people say you're all,
you're focusing on college students too 

403
00:20:25,121 --> 00:20:25,954
much and it's like,
do realize they get out of college 

404
00:20:28,590 --> 00:20:29,423
usually,
right.

405
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:30,393
If they're supposed to.
So tell me a little bit more about sort 

406
00:20:32,351 --> 00:20:33,184
of what you're doing now.
I know you just spoke at Heterodox and 

407
00:20:35,210 --> 00:20:35,921
uh,
or let's start.

408
00:20:35,921 --> 00:20:36,754
Let's start with that

409
00:20:36,810 --> 00:20:37,643
heterodox.
Yeah.

410
00:20:37,710 --> 00:20:38,160
Yeah.
Well,

411
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:40,710
the Heterodox Academy's first 
conference,

412
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:41,633
uh,
they and fire are really at the 

413
00:20:42,661 --> 00:20:47,661
forefront institutionally of defending 
viewpoint diversity on campuses.

414
00:20:48,300 --> 00:20:52,330
A fire from sort of more of a legal 
perspective and Heterodox at the faculty

415
00:20:52,360 --> 00:20:55,190
administrative perspective and it was 
point.

416
00:20:55,270 --> 00:20:56,103
It was an intense conferences.
The only conference I've ever been to 

417
00:20:57,731 --> 00:20:59,020
where I thought they should have been 
longer.

418
00:20:59,021 --> 00:21:01,190
I wanted to go longer.
It was a daisy.

419
00:21:01,220 --> 00:21:03,820
All academics in the audience as well,
or do they open that up?

420
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:04,993
I think.
I think there were probably 

421
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:07,953
non-academics there.
I know that there were a lot of 

422
00:21:08,831 --> 00:21:10,540
journalists there.
Uh,

423
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:15,600
and most everyone I met were students or
faculty or Admin or journalists.

424
00:21:17,650 --> 00:21:19,730
So I don't know.
I don't know what the,

425
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:22,710
what the entry rules were,
but you know,

426
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:25,630
the panels were as,
as Jonathan Heit at the end of the day,

427
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:27,460
I,
I,

428
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:28,353
Jonathan Count only three people who are
on the panels of I guess 28 people who 

429
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:33,910
might be conservative.

430
00:21:34,270 --> 00:21:36,450
So he himself pointed out,
you know,

431
00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:40,630
we're striving for viewpoint diversity,
but the fact is it's an uphill battle,

432
00:21:40,690 --> 00:21:42,040
you know,
we're not going to get just,

433
00:21:42,190 --> 00:21:43,023
just like we shouldn't expect a 50 slash
50 sex ratio amongst software software 

434
00:21:46,751 --> 00:21:47,584
engineers between men and women were 
we're not going to get a 50 slash 50 

435
00:21:50,741 --> 00:21:53,620
ratio of liberals and conservatives on 
college campuses.

436
00:21:54,010 --> 00:21:54,843
It's not necessarily the kind of work 
that conservatives flocked to in the 

437
00:21:57,671 --> 00:21:58,504
same numbers as liberals do.
So I think we need to be careful about 

438
00:22:01,630 --> 00:22:05,140
imagining what,
what equity would look like as in all of

439
00:22:05,141 --> 00:22:07,870
these arguments.
At an ideal level,

440
00:22:07,871 --> 00:22:12,871
why would it be that conservatives would
be less inclined to be doing academics?

441
00:22:13,300 --> 00:22:16,630
I guess it depends on what our 
definition of conservative is.

442
00:22:16,660 --> 00:22:17,493
One of stereotype that comes to mind 
that I may regret saying is that a 

443
00:22:22,030 --> 00:22:27,030
liberal types take some odd pride and 
not caring about making a good living,

444
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:34,100
making good money in faculty positions 
tend to tend to fit that right?

445
00:22:34,170 --> 00:22:36,130
Certainly Evergreen did.
Um,

446
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:37,300
so,
you know,

447
00:22:37,301 --> 00:22:38,134
if you,
if what if one of your primary goals is 

448
00:22:40,871 --> 00:22:43,010
not only to make a good living for 
yourself,

449
00:22:43,011 --> 00:22:46,600
but potentially to leap out of the 
living you're making and you know,

450
00:22:46,601 --> 00:22:50,140
really hit it big,
you're unlikely to do that in academia.

451
00:22:50,530 --> 00:22:51,700
Uh,
so there's a,

452
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:58,080
there's a sort of a risk aversion.
I think I'm to the prospect of making it

453
00:22:59,231 --> 00:23:04,231
big financially that academics tend to 
have that maybe,

454
00:23:04,780 --> 00:23:06,680
maybe conservatives would be less likely
to,

455
00:23:06,820 --> 00:23:07,653
to go that way.
Do you think it could also be the 

456
00:23:08,861 --> 00:23:11,170
conservatives were just self selecting 
out,

457
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:13,360
like they realized the hostile 
atmosphere.

458
00:23:13,361 --> 00:23:15,220
So they were just like,
why would I do this?

459
00:23:15,310 --> 00:23:16,143
Absolutely.
That is one of the explanations for 

460
00:23:17,441 --> 00:23:18,730
sure.
And um,

461
00:23:18,780 --> 00:23:20,290
you know,
certainly in some fields,

462
00:23:20,650 --> 00:23:21,483
you know,
an engineered the,

463
00:23:21,510 --> 00:23:24,130
the less human focus,
the field,

464
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:26,530
the more conservatives there are,
we know this.

465
00:23:26,530 --> 00:23:28,180
So in engineering,
for instance,

466
00:23:28,210 --> 00:23:32,680
in the physical sciences,
mostly people don't speak their politics

467
00:23:32,681 --> 00:23:36,820
on college campuses if they are on the 
right because they're not welcome there.

468
00:23:37,210 --> 00:23:38,043
Uh,
but,

469
00:23:38,230 --> 00:23:39,063
uh,
but those fields do have higher 

470
00:23:40,151 --> 00:23:42,430
representations of conservatives than 
liberals.

471
00:23:42,790 --> 00:23:44,770
But most of the social sciences and 
humanities,

472
00:23:45,130 --> 00:23:45,963
uh,
we're all always tended liberal but are 

473
00:23:48,740 --> 00:23:50,690
even more so,
I don't remember the numbers off the top

474
00:23:50,691 --> 00:23:53,060
of my head,
but even more so now than they ever have

475
00:23:53,061 --> 00:23:55,400
been.
And that's a problem to have,

476
00:23:55,660 --> 00:23:56,510
you know,
take,

477
00:23:56,670 --> 00:23:59,750
you have to have a field that is trying 
to understand the nature of humans,

478
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:00,913
any of the social sciences,
psychology or anthropology or sociology 

479
00:24:04,430 --> 00:24:09,430
to be entirely limited to people on the 
left side of the political spectrum.

480
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:10,993
Maybe you're missing something in your 
explanation of what humans are if you 

481
00:24:14,301 --> 00:24:17,990
don't have anyone who's willing to speak
to a different political position.

482
00:24:18,620 --> 00:24:19,380
So when I've talked

483
00:24:19,380 --> 00:24:22,320
to Jordan Peterson,
who you referenced and my friend Peter,

484
00:24:22,321 --> 00:24:24,660
but goes in and a couple other people 
who are professors,

485
00:24:25,050 --> 00:24:26,520
um,
you probably know Pete,

486
00:24:26,521 --> 00:24:27,354
right?
Yeah.

487
00:24:27,430 --> 00:24:30,750
Um,
I think a lot of their argument is based

488
00:24:30,751 --> 00:24:32,030
around that,
you know,

489
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:32,913
gender studies and these sort of,
these sort of new fueled basically have 

490
00:24:38,251 --> 00:24:42,370
a completely separate set of standards 
that have been.

491
00:24:42,371 --> 00:24:43,204
It had virtually nothing to do with any 
of the standards that you as an 

492
00:24:45,871 --> 00:24:50,550
evolutionary biologist had to,
had to and have to prescribe to,

493
00:24:50,560 --> 00:24:53,700
to do your work.
Is that really the crux of it?

494
00:24:53,701 --> 00:24:56,820
Sort of at the institutional level at 
schools

495
00:24:56,940 --> 00:24:57,773
I,
that is at least one of the first site 

496
00:25:00,070 --> 00:25:01,500
that,
that I have seen as well,

497
00:25:01,530 --> 00:25:06,210
that there are many new fields,
many of which end in the word studies,

498
00:25:06,590 --> 00:25:09,980
uh,
like gender studies that are there.

499
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:10,913
They're made up.
They are based in postmodernism and not 

500
00:25:14,731 --> 00:25:15,564
just,
not just postmodernism because at its 

501
00:25:16,770 --> 00:25:19,860
base originally there,
there's some stuff of value there,

502
00:25:19,890 --> 00:25:20,723
believe it or not,
but the new manifestations in critical 

503
00:25:23,881 --> 00:25:24,714
theory and such are,
are basically free of any fact checking 

504
00:25:28,771 --> 00:25:30,390
apparatus.
So they are,

505
00:25:30,391 --> 00:25:32,640
they are anti science,
anti enlightenment,

506
00:25:32,900 --> 00:25:33,733
and,
and they're quite willing to say things 

507
00:25:35,401 --> 00:25:37,210
like reason is a tool.

508
00:25:37,340 --> 00:25:38,850
Patriarchy.
This is the new one.

509
00:25:38,870 --> 00:25:41,300
This sort of popping up in the last six 
months.

510
00:25:41,330 --> 00:25:41,870
Right?

511
00:25:41,870 --> 00:25:42,680
And I mean,
you,

512
00:25:42,680 --> 00:25:43,513
you just have to know you're dealing 
with people who are not going to be 

513
00:25:46,280 --> 00:25:48,290
playing in good faith and willing to 
have an.

514
00:25:48,300 --> 00:25:49,470
Actually,
you know,

515
00:25:49,490 --> 00:25:51,440
viable argument at the point that they 
say that,

516
00:25:52,150 --> 00:25:52,971
uh,
so it's,

517
00:25:52,971 --> 00:25:55,040
that there has been capture,
you know,

518
00:25:55,041 --> 00:25:58,100
pretty pretty solid capture and a few of
the more traditional fields.

519
00:25:58,590 --> 00:26:00,230
I'm not entirely,
in fact,

520
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:02,790
I met several people at Heterodox,
um,

521
00:26:02,810 --> 00:26:05,330
who are sociologists who are fighting 
this from within,

522
00:26:05,331 --> 00:26:07,490
but sociology is one of the captured 
fields,

523
00:26:07,820 --> 00:26:08,653
anthropology,
geography and cultural anthropology in 

524
00:26:12,681 --> 00:26:13,514
particular,
so that the fact that it is that there 

525
00:26:17,961 --> 00:26:18,794
are fields that students can go into and
basically never be exposed to the idea 

526
00:26:24,711 --> 00:26:29,060
of you're going to generate as many 
possible explanations for the thing that

527
00:26:29,061 --> 00:26:29,894
you've observed as possible.
We're going to do hypothesis generation 

528
00:26:31,941 --> 00:26:35,510
first and then we're going to try to 
figure out what would have to be true if

529
00:26:35,511 --> 00:26:36,344
any,
if each of those individual hypotheses 

530
00:26:37,311 --> 00:26:41,150
were true and then we're going to try to
figure out how to test between them.

531
00:26:41,480 --> 00:26:45,830
That's the scientific method and it's 
inefficient.

532
00:26:46,250 --> 00:26:47,083
It sometimes gets things wrong,
but it is the only tool we have to over 

533
00:26:52,461 --> 00:26:55,230
time get to a better and better 
understanding of the universe.

534
00:26:55,770 --> 00:26:56,910
And there's,
there's no,

535
00:26:57,050 --> 00:27:00,390
there's no method over in gender 
studies.

536
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:01,553
Yeah.
So how have you seen that way of 

537
00:27:03,691 --> 00:27:04,524
thinking leak into the harder sciences 
because this seems to be the next 

538
00:27:08,521 --> 00:27:09,354
frontier.

539
00:27:09,500 --> 00:27:10,610
Yeah.
Um,

540
00:27:11,870 --> 00:27:12,703
there are,
there are some schools now that when 

541
00:27:15,561 --> 00:27:17,910
positions come open in,
um,

542
00:27:18,770 --> 00:27:21,670
in science disciplines.
So for most schools,

543
00:27:21,671 --> 00:27:22,504
this wasn't sure at Evergreen,
but at most schools through the hiring 

544
00:27:24,321 --> 00:27:25,830
apparatus within,
uh,

545
00:27:26,660 --> 00:27:28,130
within department.
So you know,

546
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:31,430
someone in physics retires and physics 
gets to the society,

547
00:27:31,431 --> 00:27:32,264
the Physics Faculty and Department Chair
and such get to decide what kind of 

548
00:27:34,851 --> 00:27:35,684
physicists they're going to hire next.
Somehow increasingly science educators 

549
00:27:40,491 --> 00:27:43,460
are being as being hired rather than 
scientists themselves.

550
00:27:43,461 --> 00:27:44,294
And science educator is a code word for 
people coming out of Ed schools and 

551
00:27:48,201 --> 00:27:52,640
education schools have,
have this pathogen very,

552
00:27:52,670 --> 00:27:53,503
very badly.
So I'm science educators being hired 

553
00:27:56,331 --> 00:27:57,164
into positions that should have been 
scientists means that now you have a 

554
00:27:59,601 --> 00:28:00,434
weakening of scientific voice and 
scientific method in science 

555
00:28:02,991 --> 00:28:05,900
departments.
You have A.

556
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:06,793
I mean even was it just recently nature,
I think published one of the two big 

557
00:28:10,910 --> 00:28:14,090
science journals published.

558
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:15,073
I don't know if it was a letter or an 
article arguing that one of the primary 

559
00:28:19,581 --> 00:28:24,050
things that science needs to be focusing
on is increasing diversity.

560
00:28:25,080 --> 00:28:29,030
So you have two problems with this.
What are your measures of diversity?

561
00:28:29,031 --> 00:28:31,010
It's the stuff that you can see on first
pass.

562
00:28:31,011 --> 00:28:31,844
This is immutable characteristics and 
has nothing to do with actually all the 

563
00:28:34,341 --> 00:28:35,174
other kinds of diversity that are 
interesting and that you know and that 

564
00:28:37,990 --> 00:28:41,060
we can change things like political 
belief and you know,

565
00:28:41,070 --> 00:28:41,903
some things that we can't change,
but things like being on the autism 

566
00:28:43,641 --> 00:28:46,190
spectrum or you know,
even like,

567
00:28:46,230 --> 00:28:47,063
you know,
colorblindness or dyslexia or lefthand 

568
00:28:48,750 --> 00:28:52,520
and is all of which provide your brain 
without us ever being conscious of it.

569
00:28:52,610 --> 00:28:53,443
Some different way of approaching the 
world and that kind of diversity in a 

570
00:28:56,181 --> 00:28:58,040
group of people,
ads,

571
00:28:59,150 --> 00:28:59,983
ads,
actual intrigue and nuanced to 

572
00:29:01,310 --> 00:29:02,150
conversations.

573
00:29:02,530 --> 00:29:04,600
And then I'm a lefty with a little 
dyslexia.

574
00:29:04,610 --> 00:29:06,330
Actually.
I'm a lefty too.

575
00:29:07,860 --> 00:29:08,280
Yep.
So,

576
00:29:08,280 --> 00:29:09,690
you know,
lefty is like,

577
00:29:09,810 --> 00:29:10,643
you know,
like many other members of these groups 

578
00:29:11,401 --> 00:29:12,234
with.
I happened to happen at other lefty one 

579
00:29:13,441 --> 00:29:15,120
because I've,
I've done some research on it.

580
00:29:15,300 --> 00:29:17,330
Lefties are overrepresented at,
you know,

581
00:29:17,331 --> 00:29:20,070
in the National Academy of Sciences and 
a mental institution.

582
00:29:21,470 --> 00:29:22,303
You've got this really big spread.
Well now I can see that there's really 

583
00:29:24,581 --> 00:29:27,640
two options for your future.
That's right.

584
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:28,833
Alright,
let's talk about consciousness a little 

585
00:29:29,981 --> 00:29:31,320
bit.
I just had Sam Harrison,

586
00:29:31,380 --> 00:29:33,790
we,
we've talked about it quite extensively.

587
00:29:33,791 --> 00:29:36,640
I think you have some thoughts on 
consciousness,

588
00:29:36,641 --> 00:29:38,690
the nature of consciousness.
Indeed.

589
00:29:39,070 --> 00:29:42,190
Yeah.
I mean it's probably do this right.

590
00:29:42,191 --> 00:29:43,024
We would need to agree on a definition 
that I'm not sure that that's any 

591
00:29:45,881 --> 00:29:46,714
definition that we choose will 
immediately antagonized some amount of 

592
00:29:49,211 --> 00:29:52,150
your audience.
This is like defining,

593
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:55,410
defining truth,
which seems to be tough these days.

594
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:56,800
Yes,
exactly.

595
00:29:57,010 --> 00:29:58,270
Um,
so maybe,

596
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:00,820
maybe rather than that,
um,

597
00:30:02,100 --> 00:30:05,200
are humans the only conscious beings on 
this planet?

598
00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:07,900
I don't think so,
but we are the most conscious.

599
00:30:07,901 --> 00:30:08,734
We are the most fully conscious and we 
have better access to our own 

600
00:30:11,651 --> 00:30:15,520
consciousness obviously.
Then we have access to the consciousness

601
00:30:15,550 --> 00:30:16,383
of say,
dolphins or elephants or other apes or 

602
00:30:20,650 --> 00:30:25,650
maybe a wolves.
Any of these long lived social organisms

603
00:30:26,591 --> 00:30:27,424
with long childhoods and generational 
overlap who lived sometimes with three 

604
00:30:31,121 --> 00:30:31,954
generations together at a time,
so there's transmission of cultural 

605
00:30:34,091 --> 00:30:34,924
information,
organisms that have theory of mind and 

606
00:30:37,481 --> 00:30:41,680
can imagine can put themselves in the 
other individual's position and think,

607
00:30:41,681 --> 00:30:43,720
what do they think is going on right 
now?

608
00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:44,553
Even though I understand that that's a 
different thing than what I think is 

609
00:30:46,541 --> 00:30:47,374
going on right now,
which we now know that certain monkeys 

610
00:30:49,331 --> 00:30:51,350
and apes exactly do that.
Yes,

611
00:30:51,470 --> 00:30:52,303
theory of mind.
There's a beautiful book called Baboon 

612
00:30:56,920 --> 00:30:57,753
Metaphysics by the husband and wife,
team Chaney and Seyfarth that basically 

613
00:30:59,291 --> 00:31:02,290
explores theory of mind and baboons.
Uh,

614
00:31:02,291 --> 00:31:02,741
and,
you know,

615
00:31:02,741 --> 00:31:04,690
it's not the only one.
They're,

616
00:31:04,820 --> 00:31:06,310
they're not the only spaces,
but,

617
00:31:06,520 --> 00:31:07,353
you know,
how do we as humans find our 

618
00:31:10,181 --> 00:31:11,440
consciousness best?
You know,

619
00:31:11,460 --> 00:31:12,293
there,
there are ways that we can hack into 

620
00:31:14,020 --> 00:31:17,260
what is sometimes been called flow 
states or um,

621
00:31:17,310 --> 00:31:17,710
you know,
that's,

622
00:31:17,710 --> 00:31:19,190
that's the most common one.
But yeah,

623
00:31:19,210 --> 00:31:22,540
we can do so through,
well through deep conversation,

624
00:31:22,990 --> 00:31:24,970
um,
through meditation,

625
00:31:25,540 --> 00:31:30,370
through music,
some sometimes through producing it,

626
00:31:30,371 --> 00:31:32,920
but sometimes through experiencing,
especially live music,

627
00:31:33,610 --> 00:31:37,210
dance for some people,
Hallucinogens,

628
00:31:37,660 --> 00:31:39,760
sex,
sport,

629
00:31:39,810 --> 00:31:40,643
you know,
intense physical or physiological or 

630
00:31:44,081 --> 00:31:49,081
emotional experience in which we are 
just moving with others usually.

631
00:31:50,160 --> 00:31:51,880
And you know,
there are those of us like myself,

632
00:31:51,881 --> 00:31:52,714
you know,
very strong introvert who will find so 

633
00:31:54,041 --> 00:31:55,570
my deepest flow states,
you know,

634
00:31:55,571 --> 00:31:56,404
access to consciousness alone,
you're alone in the Amazon when I could 

635
00:31:59,531 --> 00:32:02,530
sit and watch monkeys and write that for
me.

636
00:32:02,531 --> 00:32:04,570
That's one of them.
But sport is also.

637
00:32:05,230 --> 00:32:07,870
So when I talked about this with Sam,
the way he was defining it,

638
00:32:07,871 --> 00:32:10,180
which I think is sort of similar to what
you're saying here,

639
00:32:10,540 --> 00:32:11,373
it strikes me as just like an extreme 
ability to maintain present in the 

640
00:32:17,111 --> 00:32:19,570
moment that that really sort of when a 
basketball player.

641
00:32:19,571 --> 00:32:22,120
So if we use the sport analogy,
like a basketball player when they're in

642
00:32:22,121 --> 00:32:23,020
the zone,
you know,

643
00:32:23,021 --> 00:32:25,810
and Jordan scores 20 points in five 
minutes and he just,

644
00:32:25,990 --> 00:32:26,590
he,
he said,

645
00:32:26,590 --> 00:32:27,423
well,
everything I threw up just went in like 

646
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:29,473
that.
They hit that level of consciousness or 

647
00:32:31,421 --> 00:32:32,254
for you to be outside enough out of 
yourself to be able to write in that 

648
00:32:35,981 --> 00:32:38,180
perfect moment or,
or whatever it is that it.

649
00:32:38,180 --> 00:32:39,013
Oh,
it always seems about present more than 

650
00:32:40,251 --> 00:32:40,930
anything else.
To me,

651
00:32:40,930 --> 00:32:42,770
there is a kind of,
um,

652
00:32:43,250 --> 00:32:47,780
time stopping both time stopping and 
disappearing on you at the same time,

653
00:32:47,781 --> 00:32:50,880
which I think is part of why entheogenic
hallucinogens can,

654
00:32:50,910 --> 00:32:51,743
can capture that as well because their 
sense of time just disappearing on you 

655
00:32:54,951 --> 00:32:56,150
is,
is remarkable.

656
00:32:56,430 --> 00:32:58,410
Um,
so you,

657
00:32:58,480 --> 00:32:59,313
you both don't care about time and time 
passes usually in ways that seemed 

658
00:33:03,800 --> 00:33:06,640
quicker than you were expecting them to,
uh,

659
00:33:06,650 --> 00:33:09,650
with,
with a sport or um,

660
00:33:10,340 --> 00:33:11,830
or right meditation that,
yeah,

661
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:13,670
that's not one that I do.
But um,

662
00:33:13,671 --> 00:33:15,170
you know,
Sam has a lot to say about that.

663
00:33:15,171 --> 00:33:16,760
Of course.
Um,

664
00:33:17,780 --> 00:33:21,410
yeah,
I remember when I was doing mushrooms at

665
00:33:21,410 --> 00:33:23,540
least sort of in college age,
somewhat consistently,

666
00:33:23,541 --> 00:33:24,374
maybe every six months or something.
I would always want the clocks to be 

667
00:33:28,010 --> 00:33:29,300
covered.
Yes.

668
00:33:29,330 --> 00:33:32,270
Because I hated the numbers are no good.

669
00:33:32,270 --> 00:33:33,103
I did.
I definitely did one trip like five 

670
00:33:34,461 --> 00:33:35,730
hours in a mirror,
forget that,

671
00:33:35,930 --> 00:33:36,763
but I always wanted the clocks to be 
covered because the idea that time was 

672
00:33:39,021 --> 00:33:43,400
passing while I was in this state was,
was very scary to me.

673
00:33:43,410 --> 00:33:44,181
Yeah,
that's scary.

674
00:33:44,181 --> 00:33:45,710
Or just I just wanted nothing to do with
it.

675
00:33:45,711 --> 00:33:49,190
I guess maybe it doesn't matter what 
that distinction is,

676
00:33:49,191 --> 00:33:51,320
you know,
scary or just not interested.

677
00:33:51,560 --> 00:33:52,190
Right.
But,

678
00:33:52,190 --> 00:33:53,810
um,
so it's,

679
00:33:53,960 --> 00:33:54,793
it's very different than the kinds of 
consciousness enhancing activities that 

680
00:33:58,131 --> 00:33:58,964
we can engage in,
including hallucinogens are very 

681
00:34:00,771 --> 00:34:01,604
different if you're inside in a room 
like this where you have no access to 

682
00:34:04,401 --> 00:34:05,234
what is going on climate illogically or 
weather-wise outside as opposed to if 

683
00:34:09,141 --> 00:34:09,974
you,
if you are out and you can watch as the 

684
00:34:12,711 --> 00:34:16,430
sunsets and as the moon comes up and you
can think again,

685
00:34:16,460 --> 00:34:17,031
oh,
right,

686
00:34:17,031 --> 00:34:18,680
it's a,
it's a,

687
00:34:18,710 --> 00:34:19,910
it's a waxing moon.

688
00:34:19,910 --> 00:34:23,150
It'll be full in four days and um,
or you know,

689
00:34:23,210 --> 00:34:24,043
or you're at a coast and you can watch 
the tides and think about the shifting 

690
00:34:26,841 --> 00:34:28,040
time.
So for me,

691
00:34:28,490 --> 00:34:29,323
thinking about time that is clearly 
being brought as clearly being revealed 

692
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:35,113
by the planet we're on as opposed to 
coming at me through a clock is more 

693
00:34:40,101 --> 00:34:40,934
meaningful and I'm willing,
I'm willing to think about time in that 

694
00:34:43,011 --> 00:34:43,844
way,
but definitely not through clocks when 

695
00:34:44,991 --> 00:34:47,780
I'm,
when I'm writing hallucinogen sport,

696
00:34:47,870 --> 00:34:49,000
any of that.
Right.

697
00:34:49,100 --> 00:34:49,933
And yet we have all of these devices now
that our men our time that are meant to 

698
00:34:55,731 --> 00:34:59,630
take our attention that are literally 
designed this way.

699
00:34:59,631 --> 00:35:00,464
Do you sense we're on so that there's 
actually a digital assault on 

700
00:35:03,711 --> 00:35:04,544
consciousness because maybe that really 
does explain so many of the other 

701
00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:09,410
problems we're having in society right 
now.

702
00:35:09,500 --> 00:35:11,360
It's,
it's one of the key pieces for sure.

703
00:35:11,360 --> 00:35:14,630
And I think that phrase is brilliant at 
digital assault on consciousness.

704
00:35:15,110 --> 00:35:18,110
This is something.
I'm Tristan Harris who I don't know,

705
00:35:18,111 --> 00:35:19,760
but I've got them on the show.
Yeah.

706
00:35:20,330 --> 00:35:22,210
Talks talks about a lot and you know,
he,

707
00:35:22,250 --> 00:35:23,083
he has been,
he has been ringing the alarm bell for 

708
00:35:24,891 --> 00:35:29,420
years about the algorithms that are 
being put into our devices that are,

709
00:35:29,660 --> 00:35:34,660
that are creating addicts out of us.
But more broadly,

710
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:37,530
you know,
the digital assault on consciousness is,

711
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:39,390
there's not,
there is,

712
00:35:39,480 --> 00:35:40,313
it's increasingly hard to find a space 
where you're just actually free and 

713
00:35:43,141 --> 00:35:43,974
clear.
And this is,

714
00:35:44,010 --> 00:35:47,160
you know,
this is part of what I do for myself and

715
00:35:47,161 --> 00:35:49,650
what I used to do for my students was 
take them to places,

716
00:35:49,830 --> 00:35:52,830
not only that we're remote and where 
they could explore nature,

717
00:35:53,370 --> 00:35:56,670
but where there was no cell signal where
there was no internet.

718
00:35:56,700 --> 00:35:57,533
So you know,
the deepest part of the Amazon that I 

719
00:35:58,501 --> 00:35:59,400
took students to.

720
00:35:59,640 --> 00:36:00,930
There's just,
there's no email,

721
00:36:00,931 --> 00:36:02,490
there's no internet,
there's no Wifi.

722
00:36:02,491 --> 00:36:03,324
We are a plane ride over the Andes and 
then a boat ride and then a truck ride 

723
00:36:07,590 --> 00:36:08,423
and then another five hours down,
a tributary of the Amazon to a place 

724
00:36:12,390 --> 00:36:14,490
with no roads,
no airstrips,

725
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:19,290
nothing.
And boy does time feel different and you

726
00:36:19,291 --> 00:36:20,124
know,
you're sleeping in little cabins that 

727
00:36:21,571 --> 00:36:22,404
are screened.
And so you wake up when the insects and 

728
00:36:24,901 --> 00:36:27,600
the birds and the monkeys wake up and 
they start talking at you.

729
00:36:27,630 --> 00:36:29,190
They're not talking to you the document 
themselves,

730
00:36:29,610 --> 00:36:30,443
but you getting a sense of the rhythms 
of the planet that we're on can return 

731
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:39,240
people,
I think to a real sense of self and also

732
00:36:39,241 --> 00:36:42,690
to a sense of what they value,
what their passions are.

733
00:36:42,810 --> 00:36:45,870
And this is a big thing I think is 
missing in many of the.

734
00:36:45,980 --> 00:36:47,400
To return to what we were talking about 
earlier.

735
00:36:47,580 --> 00:36:47,891
You know,
the,

736
00:36:47,891 --> 00:36:49,770
the far left activists,
the,

737
00:36:49,860 --> 00:36:54,860
the control left mostly I think lack 
another passion.

738
00:36:56,520 --> 00:36:58,240
And I've said before I,
you know,

739
00:36:58,460 --> 00:36:59,293
the prediction I would make is that you 
have very few rock climbers or scares 

740
00:37:02,550 --> 00:37:03,383
among the radical left activists.
People who have something that they can 

741
00:37:06,691 --> 00:37:10,290
engage in that frees them from time and 
devices from,

742
00:37:10,440 --> 00:37:12,900
from a response to time.
I need to be here then,

743
00:37:12,901 --> 00:37:15,660
or this my thing just pinged me.
I need to look at it,

744
00:37:16,350 --> 00:37:17,183
uh,
are better able to center themselves to 

745
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:23,240
find their own consciousness and 
discover who,

746
00:37:23,290 --> 00:37:24,990
who they are and what they want to be in
the world.

747
00:37:25,160 --> 00:37:27,450
What does that say about the self?
Do you think?

748
00:37:28,140 --> 00:37:28,973
To me,
there's something there about like if 

749
00:37:30,031 --> 00:37:34,410
you really believe in the self and your 
and the individually and your ability to

750
00:37:34,411 --> 00:37:35,244
overcome things,
you don't need all of these external 

751
00:37:37,591 --> 00:37:38,424
processes to help define the world 
because you're sort of defining it 

752
00:37:41,701 --> 00:37:42,534
yourself.

753
00:37:42,610 --> 00:37:43,443
I,
I agree and I think I do think for me 

754
00:37:46,231 --> 00:37:50,880
self sufficiency is one of my highest 
values personally and I have a.

755
00:37:50,940 --> 00:37:54,720
I have a very hard time understanding 
anyone who says,

756
00:37:55,380 --> 00:37:56,430
Oh,
if you leave me on my own,

757
00:37:56,431 --> 00:37:57,890
I wouldn't know what to do.
Like I,

758
00:37:58,060 --> 00:37:59,640
I just,
I just don't get this.

759
00:37:59,641 --> 00:38:01,550
I don't get why you would.
Maybe it's a lefty thing.

760
00:38:01,551 --> 00:38:03,870
I'd be fine.
I'm like,

761
00:38:03,871 --> 00:38:04,530
what?
Why would.

762
00:38:04,530 --> 00:38:08,130
Why would you broadcast to the world 
that you would be helpless?

763
00:38:08,340 --> 00:38:11,210
This doesn't make any sense to me,
but you know,

764
00:38:11,220 --> 00:38:12,053
there,
there are plenty of situations where I 

765
00:38:12,691 --> 00:38:13,524
wouldn't know what to do and I would 
know what to do in situations that most 

766
00:38:15,181 --> 00:38:17,490
people wouldn't just because of where 
I've traveled and where I've lived,

767
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:18,833
but the idea that self sufficiency 
require the idea that you want to be 

768
00:38:22,711 --> 00:38:24,810
self sufficient requires a concept of 
self,

769
00:38:25,010 --> 00:38:26,880
I think is is important here.

770
00:38:28,710 --> 00:38:29,940
Yeah.
Maybe just maybe that.

771
00:38:30,260 --> 00:38:31,740
Yeah,
and if you give that up,

772
00:38:31,741 --> 00:38:34,590
well then boy,
you're giving up a lot.

773
00:38:34,620 --> 00:38:39,620
You give up so much.
And the devices as,

774
00:38:41,470 --> 00:38:44,020
as heroin,
as Tristan Harris has argued,

775
00:38:44,350 --> 00:38:46,570
are addicting us.
It's no accident.

776
00:38:46,600 --> 00:38:46,991
We're,
you know,

777
00:38:46,991 --> 00:38:49,150
we,
we should not view ourselves actually as

778
00:38:49,151 --> 00:38:50,500
weak.
We,

779
00:38:50,650 --> 00:38:54,430
when we get addicted to the things we 
should wean ourselves.

780
00:38:54,460 --> 00:38:58,900
We should as much as possible to provide
ourselves zones,

781
00:38:58,901 --> 00:39:02,440
periods of time when we have no access 
to those things.

782
00:39:02,441 --> 00:39:03,274
And so we are actually free and clear to
let our minds do what they will because 

783
00:39:07,841 --> 00:39:08,800
when,
when we,

784
00:39:09,010 --> 00:39:12,940
when they have access to our brands,
they are designed to addict us.

785
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:13,833
So using,
using the discipline that you're an 

786
00:39:15,431 --> 00:39:16,264
expert in,
is it possible that we're in a unique 

787
00:39:20,201 --> 00:39:21,034
position right now because of technology
that our brains are actually evolving 

788
00:39:24,821 --> 00:39:29,530
now evolving or I guess devolving 
depending on which way you look at it at

789
00:39:29,531 --> 00:39:33,700
an extraordinarily high pace or,
or something like that,

790
00:39:33,730 --> 00:39:34,650
you know,
the,

791
00:39:34,720 --> 00:39:35,553
the rate of change across almost every 
sector in the economy and in human 

792
00:39:39,581 --> 00:39:41,980
experience right now is higher than it's
ever been.

793
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:45,400
Could you say that about any moment in 
history maybe,

794
00:39:46,030 --> 00:39:49,510
but the rate of change itself is 
changing as well.

795
00:39:49,720 --> 00:39:51,490
So that's the important distinction,
right?

796
00:39:51,790 --> 00:39:52,623
Um,
and what is going on with technology is 

797
00:39:57,310 --> 00:39:59,260
completely untested.
And so this is,

798
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:01,240
this is a place where,
you know,

799
00:40:01,241 --> 00:40:02,074
why,
why am I so certain that I'm still on 

800
00:40:03,701 --> 00:40:04,534
the left,
even though most of the people who say 

801
00:40:06,221 --> 00:40:07,054
they're on the left publicly,
I don't have any interest in continuing 

802
00:40:09,521 --> 00:40:12,040
to talk to them because they don't seem 
to be making any sense.

803
00:40:12,850 --> 00:40:16,150
I look at systems that are involved,
that are,

804
00:40:16,210 --> 00:40:19,510
that are in stable state because they've
evolved over millions,

805
00:40:19,511 --> 00:40:21,190
tens of millions,
hundreds of millions of years.

806
00:40:21,670 --> 00:40:25,690
And my instinct is don't mess with that 
until you really,

807
00:40:25,691 --> 00:40:28,660
really understand what you're doing.
And so for instance,

808
00:40:28,661 --> 00:40:29,494
I,
unlike many scientists and not feeding 

809
00:40:31,541 --> 00:40:32,374
my children gmos,
I give them and myself organic food and 

810
00:40:35,801 --> 00:40:37,990
when we meet,
which we do a lot of,

811
00:40:38,320 --> 00:40:40,840
I want that meat to have been fed the 
grass,

812
00:40:40,841 --> 00:40:45,640
if it's the food of its ancestors,
what or what exactly is the harm?

813
00:40:45,670 --> 00:40:49,180
We now know a little bit of this but 20 
years ago if you would ask me what's the

814
00:40:49,181 --> 00:40:52,210
harm and feeding cows grants.
So I have no idea,

815
00:40:52,750 --> 00:40:53,583
but I know that messing with a system 
that was working is more likely to 

816
00:40:58,210 --> 00:41:02,440
interfere with something in that animal 
then not why,

817
00:41:02,460 --> 00:41:05,260
you know,
why would you mess if you could not,

818
00:41:05,261 --> 00:41:07,210
and of course their economic reasons to 
mess.

819
00:41:07,630 --> 00:41:09,250
But um,
the,

820
00:41:09,340 --> 00:41:11,500
the,
don't mess with systems that are working

821
00:41:11,501 --> 00:41:14,230
until you really have a solid 
understanding of what the,

822
00:41:14,470 --> 00:41:15,303
what the effects are going to be.
The use of the precautionary principle 

823
00:41:17,891 --> 00:41:20,620
pretty widely is what puts me pretty far
on the left,

824
00:41:21,040 --> 00:41:25,000
but systems that we've created that are 
evolutionary,

825
00:41:25,001 --> 00:41:25,834
but people don't know that we need to 
regulate in order to get them under 

826
00:41:29,711 --> 00:41:30,544
control because nuclear energy isn't 
gonna regulate itself and habitat loss 

827
00:41:34,940 --> 00:41:37,610
throughout most of the world is not 
going to regulate itself.

828
00:41:37,850 --> 00:41:38,683
So there are some problems that we've 
created and that are bigger than 

829
00:41:40,881 --> 00:41:42,920
individuals can do anything about.
And you know,

830
00:41:42,921 --> 00:41:44,060
that's why I'm not a libertarian.

831
00:41:44,150 --> 00:41:45,900
Yeah.
Right.

832
00:41:45,910 --> 00:41:47,340
And this is.
This is where I think we have.

833
00:41:47,350 --> 00:41:48,690
Oh,
I get it.

834
00:41:48,720 --> 00:41:49,553
Like I don't know that if you just leave
everybody to do whatever the hell they 

835
00:41:51,871 --> 00:41:52,704
want all the time,
that everybody isn't going to be doing 

836
00:41:53,671 --> 00:41:54,504
all sorts of awful things.
I think generally the market does fix 

837
00:41:56,641 --> 00:41:58,140
some of that,
but I get what you're saying.

838
00:41:58,141 --> 00:42:02,180
Like these systems are I suppose often 
precarious in nature too,

839
00:42:02,460 --> 00:42:03,293
to the point where anything can be 
tilted one way or the other and then 

840
00:42:05,850 --> 00:42:07,830
we've got bigger problems.
Right?

841
00:42:08,670 --> 00:42:10,680
So how do we,
how do we fix some of this stuff?

842
00:42:10,710 --> 00:42:12,840
How do we,
how do we actually scale this back?

843
00:42:12,841 --> 00:42:13,490
I mean,
I get it,

844
00:42:13,490 --> 00:42:14,940
you know,
most of my artists will get.

845
00:42:14,941 --> 00:42:16,350
Okay,
well we have to keep talking about it.

846
00:42:16,370 --> 00:42:18,270
Should we have to wake more people up?
Sure.

847
00:42:18,630 --> 00:42:23,630
But what can you do using the knowledge 
you have in the study you've done?

848
00:42:24,250 --> 00:42:25,083
I have less.
I have less insight right now at least 

849
00:42:27,730 --> 00:42:31,030
to answer in this amount of time for the
adult systems.

850
00:42:31,240 --> 00:42:32,073
Um,
but I think I have a fair amount of 

851
00:42:34,901 --> 00:42:35,734
clarity on what we should do,
should be doing with children and with 

852
00:42:38,651 --> 00:42:40,060
parenting.
We're really,

853
00:42:40,061 --> 00:42:42,940
really not doing a,
which is,

854
00:42:43,090 --> 00:42:45,670
when you say the adult systems,
you mean like economic system?

855
00:42:45,910 --> 00:42:46,743
Well,
it's just like,

856
00:42:46,810 --> 00:42:48,730
and,
and more specifically,

857
00:42:48,850 --> 00:42:53,260
how do you get adults who were already 
who they are to behave differently.

858
00:42:53,760 --> 00:42:54,290
Um,
it's,

859
00:42:54,290 --> 00:42:58,980
it's less clear to me what we can do and
so we'll show them for the purpose of,

860
00:42:59,430 --> 00:43:00,550
and you know,
and the CIS.

861
00:43:00,580 --> 00:43:02,080
Yes.
Also also,

862
00:43:02,081 --> 00:43:03,720
it's true that I have,
um,

863
00:43:04,090 --> 00:43:06,760
that I'm not going to wade into,
for instance,

864
00:43:06,790 --> 00:43:08,650
what we should do a better economic 
system here.

865
00:43:08,651 --> 00:43:09,700
Now with you,
I might do it later,

866
00:43:09,701 --> 00:43:11,500
but yeah,
um,

867
00:43:11,650 --> 00:43:13,660
but with regard to,
for instance,

868
00:43:14,740 --> 00:43:16,150
you know,
most,

869
00:43:16,540 --> 00:43:20,560
most people I think have never thought 
about what childhood is and if you don't

870
00:43:20,561 --> 00:43:22,090
have children yourself and you're an 
adult,

871
00:43:22,210 --> 00:43:23,140
okay,
maybe you don't have to.

872
00:43:23,230 --> 00:43:24,063
Maybe it doesn't matter.
Like maybe it just doesn't matter to 

873
00:43:25,991 --> 00:43:27,940
you,
but if you're a parent,

874
00:43:28,930 --> 00:43:29,763
you need to think about why it is that 
we have literally the longest childhood 

875
00:43:34,571 --> 00:43:37,000
relative to lifespan of any organism on 
the planet.

876
00:43:37,480 --> 00:43:38,313
This is a feature.
This is a way for us to learn how to 

877
00:43:41,081 --> 00:43:43,360
become humans.
We are not,

878
00:43:43,390 --> 00:43:45,160
and this is,
this is a point that Brett has made very

879
00:43:45,161 --> 00:43:47,050
often.
We're not blank slates,

880
00:43:47,320 --> 00:43:51,700
but we are the blanket slates of any 
organisms on the planet.

881
00:43:51,760 --> 00:43:54,460
We,
we are more software than hardware.

882
00:43:54,820 --> 00:43:58,990
And so what we're doing for these first,
I don't know,

883
00:43:59,050 --> 00:44:02,890
11 to 25 years of our lives right now 
into the forties.

884
00:44:02,891 --> 00:44:05,620
I think it depends,
but depending on culture,

885
00:44:05,621 --> 00:44:06,454
you know,
when do you start calling yourself an 

886
00:44:07,181 --> 00:44:08,014
adult in the room?
That's what we're doing is learning how 

887
00:44:10,241 --> 00:44:11,074
to be human.
And we're learning how to be human by 

888
00:44:12,761 --> 00:44:13,594
direct exposure.
We're supposed to be learning how to be 

889
00:44:15,401 --> 00:44:19,240
human through instruction,
direct instruction by our parents,

890
00:44:19,450 --> 00:44:22,360
through observing our parents,
through observing our siblings,

891
00:44:22,361 --> 00:44:25,270
through interacting with,
including fighting with our siblings and

892
00:44:25,271 --> 00:44:27,790
having them smack us down both sometimes
literally,

893
00:44:27,791 --> 00:44:30,220
but definitely metaphorically when we do
stupid things.

894
00:44:30,640 --> 00:44:32,340
And um,
better yet,

895
00:44:32,400 --> 00:44:33,233
if our parents have lots of adult 
friends around and they have lots of 

896
00:44:35,221 --> 00:44:39,030
kids and there's a whole mess of 
humanity that we are learning from.

897
00:44:39,390 --> 00:44:40,223
And then we're also in that very long 
developmental period supposed to be 

898
00:44:43,831 --> 00:44:46,560
learning from direct physical experience
of the world.

899
00:44:46,980 --> 00:44:50,400
So the example I like to go to here is,
um,

900
00:44:50,820 --> 00:44:51,280
you know,
the,

901
00:44:51,280 --> 00:44:52,113
the roadrunner cartoons when Wiley 
Coyote scoots is way off a cliff and he 

902
00:44:57,391 --> 00:45:00,270
doesn't fall until he realizes there's 
nothing below him.

903
00:45:00,510 --> 00:45:01,500
It's funny,
right?

904
00:45:01,501 --> 00:45:04,980
Like it's really funny.
But of course it's funny because we know

905
00:45:04,981 --> 00:45:06,390
the gravity doesn't really work that 
way.

906
00:45:06,990 --> 00:45:07,823
Increasingly.
I suspect that a lot of kids and now 

907
00:45:11,670 --> 00:45:16,070
into the Ihn and,
and some of the younger millennials kind

908
00:45:16,071 --> 00:45:17,040
of art,
sure.

909
00:45:17,340 --> 00:45:18,173
Like they were protected so much by 
their helicopter parents and they were 

910
00:45:22,621 --> 00:45:23,454
behind screens rather than having real 
experience and to the extent that they 

911
00:45:26,131 --> 00:45:29,610
played sport,
it was totally regulated and overseen by

912
00:45:29,611 --> 00:45:30,444
adults and they didn't have any free 
time to go and get themselves into 

913
00:45:33,481 --> 00:45:34,314
trouble and maybe even like burn 
something down or hurt themselves or 

914
00:45:36,541 --> 00:45:37,374
break an arm or whatever it is and learn
from it that they arrive at the cusp of 

915
00:45:41,641 --> 00:45:42,990
what should have been adulthood.

916
00:45:43,440 --> 00:45:45,810
Totally unclear on what that supposed to
mean.

917
00:45:45,990 --> 00:45:46,823
Does this absolutely to you because as 
I'm hearing you say that this is the 

918
00:45:50,371 --> 00:45:51,930
bell going off in my head,
man,

919
00:45:51,931 --> 00:45:54,210
I've been on tour where Peterson for the
last six weeks.

920
00:45:54,750 --> 00:45:59,310
Everything that you just said there is 
basically what he is saying.

921
00:45:59,311 --> 00:46:00,144
He is trying to.
I sent that what he's trying to do at 

922
00:46:03,121 --> 00:46:04,380
the most personal level.
Yeah.

923
00:46:04,381 --> 00:46:05,214
He talks about society as a whole,
but at the most personal level he's 

924
00:46:07,771 --> 00:46:12,000
trying to retool young people.
It's not even retool.

925
00:46:12,030 --> 00:46:15,210
He's trying to give them the tools in 
the first place that they clearly should

926
00:46:15,211 --> 00:46:16,450
have gotten before.
Yeah,

927
00:46:16,770 --> 00:46:19,770
so that's what's so fascinating to me 
because it's like,

928
00:46:19,771 --> 00:46:21,810
how did this happen?
Right?

929
00:46:21,930 --> 00:46:23,190
How did,
how did this happen?

930
00:46:23,191 --> 00:46:24,024
And we can point to,
we can point to pharmaceuticals being 

931
00:46:27,511 --> 00:46:30,390
given to kids to make boys less boy 
like,

932
00:46:30,450 --> 00:46:32,610
and to some degree to make girls less 
girl like,

933
00:46:32,611 --> 00:46:33,630
you know,
give great,

934
00:46:33,660 --> 00:46:35,190
let's give speed to boys.

935
00:46:35,400 --> 00:46:38,520
So they'll sit and face forward and 
learn what.

936
00:46:38,580 --> 00:46:39,413
So they'll calm down,
calm down and not do rough and tumble 

937
00:46:41,881 --> 00:46:44,250
play.
And I mean that's insane.

938
00:46:44,640 --> 00:46:48,870
And at the same time,
let's give antianxiety meds to girls and

939
00:46:48,900 --> 00:46:51,660
SSR rise.
And um,

940
00:46:51,720 --> 00:46:52,553
and you know,
just just the model of schooling is 

941
00:46:53,611 --> 00:46:54,241
ridiculous.
You know,

942
00:46:54,241 --> 00:46:55,074
we have,
we have schools that have gotten rid of 

943
00:46:56,101 --> 00:47:01,101
recess because recess is dangerous and 
everyone who's ever been in school,

944
00:47:02,010 --> 00:47:02,843
even if like me,
you happen to have been a good fit for 

945
00:47:04,741 --> 00:47:05,574
the model of schools that you were in,
which I think is pretty rare actually 

946
00:47:09,210 --> 00:47:10,043
knows that you also need to have time to
get out there and play and move your 

947
00:47:13,831 --> 00:47:14,664
body and experience it and not have it 
being overseen by some adult who's 

948
00:47:18,181 --> 00:47:21,300
decided in advance what isn't,
is not safe for you to experience.

949
00:47:21,540 --> 00:47:21,900
So,
you know,

950
00:47:21,900 --> 00:47:24,420
one of the things I used to say to my 
students in advance,

951
00:47:24,690 --> 00:47:25,523
we did a lot of team building,
like actual team building and planning 

952
00:47:28,710 --> 00:47:30,730
with them in advance that these long 
study abroad trips,

953
00:47:30,731 --> 00:47:31,564
we would have spent weeks together on 
campus in advance of going on these 

954
00:47:33,941 --> 00:47:34,774
trips.

955
00:47:35,040 --> 00:47:35,873
Um,
but what I wanted to do before we left 

956
00:47:39,221 --> 00:47:42,220
was established with them.
What's your relationship with risk?

957
00:47:42,580 --> 00:47:44,230
How do you,
how do you view yourself,

958
00:47:44,320 --> 00:47:46,990
your relationship with the risk?
And we would do this in round lake and I

959
00:47:46,991 --> 00:47:48,990
would answer the question to,
you know,

960
00:47:48,991 --> 00:47:51,370
I would say to them,
actually I happen to love risk.

961
00:47:51,640 --> 00:47:53,200
I will,
I'm the leader on this trip,

962
00:47:53,680 --> 00:47:54,513
but I will keep all of you safe.
But then I'm going to go do things like 

963
00:47:58,010 --> 00:47:58,843
I am going to walk alone in the forest a
lot and do things because it happens to 

964
00:48:02,771 --> 00:48:05,440
be one of the ways that I find my 
consciousness that I,

965
00:48:05,441 --> 00:48:10,270
that I find my truest self and I don't 
expect any of you to do that also.

966
00:48:10,271 --> 00:48:11,104
But you need to be comfortable with the 
fact that your leader is going to be 

967
00:48:12,551 --> 00:48:13,570
doing that sort of thing.

968
00:48:14,020 --> 00:48:16,600
And one of the other things that we 
would talk about was,

969
00:48:16,601 --> 00:48:17,950
you know,
what's your relationship with comfort?

970
00:48:18,330 --> 00:48:19,840
You're going to be uncomfortable.
You don't have to,

971
00:48:19,960 --> 00:48:20,793
you know,
just because you can say in advance 

972
00:48:23,140 --> 00:48:23,973
you're okay with the bugs and the mud 
and the not having a phone doesn't mean 

973
00:48:27,911 --> 00:48:29,470
you actually will be when you're faced 
with it.

974
00:48:30,160 --> 00:48:35,160
But maybe most important is we are going
to leave ourselves open to serendipity.

975
00:48:36,100 --> 00:48:39,460
I cannot tell you everything that we're 
going to do or learn on this trip.

976
00:48:39,461 --> 00:48:40,294
If I could,
what would be the point of going we're 

977
00:48:42,251 --> 00:48:45,010
going to go and some interesting things 
are going to happen.

978
00:48:45,430 --> 00:48:46,263
I've,
I've had a couple of near death 

979
00:48:47,561 --> 00:48:50,020
experiences on these trips.
I didn't want them.

980
00:48:50,290 --> 00:48:53,130
My didn't know and you know,
I was,

981
00:48:53,310 --> 00:48:54,143
I was a learning experience where there 
is a learning experience and frankly on 

982
00:48:57,210 --> 00:48:58,043
the most recent one on a,
on a boat in the galapagos with eight 

983
00:49:01,271 --> 00:49:04,720
students in which the only thing that 
didn't survive was the boat,

984
00:49:05,080 --> 00:49:07,000
but it was,
it was really touch and go.

985
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:08,920
I mean,
I really did almost die.

986
00:49:09,790 --> 00:49:12,640
Those eight students and I are friends 
for life.

987
00:49:12,850 --> 00:49:13,350
Right?
You know,

988
00:49:13,350 --> 00:49:14,183
there's,
there's some of them that I'm not an 

989
00:49:14,681 --> 00:49:15,870
active contact with,
but I,

990
00:49:15,940 --> 00:49:20,940
I know where they are and that you know,
that bonds you and no,

991
00:49:21,041 --> 00:49:23,620
I'm not going to pitch a trip with 
Andrew might die.

992
00:49:24,220 --> 00:49:25,053
That's not what the goal is,
but the idea that it could happen and 

993
00:49:29,380 --> 00:49:32,560
you should have the tools on board,
the physical tools,

994
00:49:32,590 --> 00:49:34,480
psychological tools,
the emotional tools,

995
00:49:34,481 --> 00:49:35,314
the intellectual tools to figure out in 
real time as your boat is being flipped 

996
00:49:39,461 --> 00:49:43,060
by a 15 foot wave and now you're trapped
under it.

997
00:49:43,690 --> 00:49:48,690
What do you do with that?
A uniquely Evergreen type of teaching?

998
00:49:48,941 --> 00:49:50,830
Was that something that you and Brett 
really,

999
00:49:50,860 --> 00:49:51,693
that was a unique name,
their knee kind of teaching and then 

1000
00:49:53,650 --> 00:49:55,690
this last trip,
Brett was there with me as well.

1001
00:49:55,720 --> 00:49:56,553
There was,
there was a way in which I think what 

1002
00:49:58,690 --> 00:50:00,070
we,
what I said about childhood,

1003
00:50:00,970 --> 00:50:01,803
which I,
you know,

1004
00:50:02,170 --> 00:50:05,620
my interest originally in evolution was 
about the evolution of parental care and

1005
00:50:05,621 --> 00:50:06,454
territoriality and social systems and 
sexual selection and long before I ever 

1006
00:50:11,081 --> 00:50:12,940
had kids myself long before I wanted 
kids,

1007
00:50:13,510 --> 00:50:14,420
but I thought,
you know,

1008
00:50:14,440 --> 00:50:15,273
one sprint and I did have kids and I'm 
watching these amazing creatures began 

1009
00:50:18,911 --> 00:50:19,900
to grow up.
Okay,

1010
00:50:20,590 --> 00:50:25,480
let's think then about what,
what is the best way to do this?

1011
00:50:25,960 --> 00:50:26,793
And we could put them a little boxes and
make absolutely sure that they survive 

1012
00:50:31,911 --> 00:50:32,744
till the age of 18 and then we open up 
the boxes and we let them out and they 

1013
00:50:35,871 --> 00:50:36,704
have basically no chance of being adults
or even of knowing how to be adults or 

1014
00:50:41,091 --> 00:50:41,924
we could expose them to ever greater 
risk having first made absolutely sure 

1015
00:50:48,771 --> 00:50:49,604
that they know that they are loved and 
that we have their backs and that we 

1016
00:50:52,371 --> 00:50:57,230
will do anything to come in and get them
and to protect them if we can,

1017
00:50:57,860 --> 00:51:00,410
but that they are going to start going 
out into the world pretty early,

1018
00:51:00,610 --> 00:51:01,880
you know,
biking it too.

1019
00:51:02,180 --> 00:51:03,013
And you know,
we took him to the Amazon at seven and 

1020
00:51:04,371 --> 00:51:07,550
nine the first time.
And you know,

1021
00:51:07,610 --> 00:51:10,430
something could have gone wrong and I 
don't know.

1022
00:51:10,700 --> 00:51:14,300
I've known parents who lost kids and I 
don't know how you survive that,

1023
00:51:14,780 --> 00:51:19,780
but you need to be willing to take risks
such that when your kids do hit 18 or 20

1024
00:51:20,661 --> 00:51:21,494
or whatever,
you know that they're actually already 

1025
00:51:23,301 --> 00:51:24,134
on their way to being adults.
And that is gonna require backing off 

1026
00:51:28,820 --> 00:51:29,653
and letting them do some of their 
learning on their own and knowing that 

1027
00:51:31,731 --> 00:51:32,564
that's going to result in some harm 
coming to them and it's going to be 

1028
00:51:34,341 --> 00:51:36,380
physical harm,
it's going to be psychological harm,

1029
00:51:36,381 --> 00:51:41,090
it's going to be intellectual harm,
but frankly the lack of any kind of harm

1030
00:51:41,091 --> 00:51:44,320
that a lot of kids are experiencing is 
part of why they're now saying speeches,

1031
00:51:44,330 --> 00:51:45,810
violence,
right?

1032
00:51:45,830 --> 00:51:47,690
I mean that's,
that's part of how we get there.

1033
00:51:48,220 --> 00:51:49,053
If some of this,
an extension of the success of the West 

1034
00:51:52,881 --> 00:51:53,714
in a way.
Because if you take the set of kids who 

1035
00:51:56,020 --> 00:51:58,190
however old they are,
let's say we go from.

1036
00:51:58,360 --> 00:52:00,560
Although now there's a lot of studies 
that are showing that young,

1037
00:52:00,590 --> 00:52:04,430
the generation younger than millennials 
is actually leaning more conservative.

1038
00:52:04,431 --> 00:52:05,264
But let's say we take 16 to 30 roughly.
So generation y ish that you see that 

1039
00:52:10,851 --> 00:52:14,420
most of their parents were baby boomers 
who were the most successful,

1040
00:52:14,421 --> 00:52:17,600
at least financially generation ever.
Most of the baby boomers,

1041
00:52:17,601 --> 00:52:18,434
parents all went to war and you know,
lived through depression and all sorts 

1042
00:52:21,441 --> 00:52:22,274
of.
But that because the baby boomer is 

1043
00:52:23,961 --> 00:52:24,794
basically where the biggest middle class
and because there was such upward 

1044
00:52:27,021 --> 00:52:28,940
mobility,
they had it so well,

1045
00:52:29,150 --> 00:52:29,983
they kind of got their eye off the ball,
started focusing on things that didn't 

1046
00:52:32,721 --> 00:52:33,554
matter as much,
protecting kids from things that a kid 

1047
00:52:36,141 --> 00:52:39,680
would have used to have to have done.
And that is sort of what led us here.

1048
00:52:39,681 --> 00:52:40,514
So it's almost like an economic backing 
for what ended up happening 

1049
00:52:44,241 --> 00:52:45,074
psychologically.

1050
00:52:45,130 --> 00:52:45,790
Yeah,
I think.

1051
00:52:45,790 --> 00:52:47,050
I think that's apt.
You know,

1052
00:52:47,051 --> 00:52:49,870
there are so many things feeding into 
this and yes,

1053
00:52:49,871 --> 00:52:51,950
the wealth of America Post World War 
Two,

1054
00:52:52,600 --> 00:52:53,433
uh,
and the fact that those are most of the 

1055
00:52:54,551 --> 00:52:58,780
parents of the generation that seems the
most confused,

1056
00:52:59,200 --> 00:53:01,510
I think definitely there's a causal link
there.

1057
00:53:01,600 --> 00:53:02,433
Yeah.
And then you toss in the Internet and 

1058
00:53:04,391 --> 00:53:06,780
you toss on the Internet,
right?

1059
00:53:07,030 --> 00:53:08,950
Um,
which,

1060
00:53:09,160 --> 00:53:11,140
you know,
we can't go back obviously,

1061
00:53:11,450 --> 00:53:12,820
uh,
but,

1062
00:53:13,750 --> 00:53:14,583
but we need to understand that it's an 
evolutionary system and then it's going 

1063
00:53:17,531 --> 00:53:22,531
to run away from us and that we are all 
prone to be addicted to dopamine hits.

1064
00:53:24,260 --> 00:53:29,260
We were going to the quick,
the quick likes rather than,

1065
00:53:29,760 --> 00:53:31,380
you know,
even even.

1066
00:53:31,381 --> 00:53:32,214
Okay.
So take internet out of the picture for 

1067
00:53:32,971 --> 00:53:37,200
a moment if you don't know what you do 
for physical activity.

1068
00:53:37,201 --> 00:53:38,970
I bike you play basketball.

1069
00:53:39,010 --> 00:53:39,843
Okay.
So maybe with basketball it's going to 

1070
00:53:41,340 --> 00:53:44,490
be different for me.
I liked video games too.

1071
00:53:44,550 --> 00:53:45,383
Is that better?
I,

1072
00:53:45,620 --> 00:53:48,200
no,
that's probably the opposite.

1073
00:53:48,660 --> 00:53:49,493
Probably the opposite.
So I used to play a lot of ultimate 

1074
00:53:51,121 --> 00:53:52,600
frisbee and you could.
Oh,

1075
00:53:52,620 --> 00:53:54,470
like anytime there was a pickup game,
like I,

1076
00:53:54,590 --> 00:53:55,170
I,
I'm,

1077
00:53:55,170 --> 00:53:56,580
I'm there.
I was playing five,

1078
00:53:56,581 --> 00:53:57,414
six times a week for awhile and then I 
ruptured my Achilles tendon playing on 

1079
00:54:00,121 --> 00:54:02,010
an Oregon beach with students a few 
years ago.

1080
00:54:02,640 --> 00:54:04,590
I'm not doing that anymore.
Um,

1081
00:54:04,860 --> 00:54:07,620
but biking,
which I love and I find meditative.

1082
00:54:09,360 --> 00:54:10,193
I have a very hard time convincing 
myself to get on my bike even though 

1083
00:54:12,931 --> 00:54:14,130
while I'm doing it,
I love it.

1084
00:54:14,370 --> 00:54:15,203
And after I do it,
I feel better and I'm more productive 

1085
00:54:17,221 --> 00:54:21,420
and a more creative and I just am more 
in love with life,

1086
00:54:21,930 --> 00:54:26,880
but it's a pain in the ass and it's a 
little bit physically uncomfortable.

1087
00:54:27,150 --> 00:54:28,980
And you know,
all of these things are true.

1088
00:54:29,790 --> 00:54:31,760
We,
we prioritize the,

1089
00:54:31,800 --> 00:54:35,640
the pleasure of now over even something 
that for me,

1090
00:54:35,641 --> 00:54:36,474
I know not,
it's not even that I'm going to feel 

1091
00:54:37,891 --> 00:54:40,290
better after I did it.
I actually love the activity itself.

1092
00:54:40,980 --> 00:54:45,120
But getting over that sort of activation
energy to do the thing.

1093
00:54:45,121 --> 00:54:45,954
And I suspect that sport,
like actual team sports is a little bit 

1094
00:54:48,661 --> 00:54:49,650
different,
a little different.

1095
00:54:49,651 --> 00:54:51,390
Like you're ready to go,
you're ready to go.

1096
00:54:51,420 --> 00:54:51,760
Like,
oh,

1097
00:54:51,760 --> 00:54:52,800
people are there,
I'm ready.

1098
00:54:52,801 --> 00:54:54,870
I'm like,
let's go to the gym.

1099
00:54:54,871 --> 00:54:55,704
I would like into that.
Like I know that when I work out I like 

1100
00:54:57,851 --> 00:54:59,850
doing it and I feel great after it.
But it's like,

1101
00:54:59,880 --> 00:55:01,050
oh,
I got to get in my car.

1102
00:55:01,051 --> 00:55:03,300
I got to drive over there.
I got a bark and blah blah blah.

1103
00:55:03,301 --> 00:55:04,134
It feels like a chore.

1104
00:55:04,360 --> 00:55:05,760
Yeah,
but you yet,

1105
00:55:05,761 --> 00:55:06,690
you know,
it's good.

1106
00:55:06,691 --> 00:55:08,820
And yet,
so we're always fighting our nature sort

1107
00:55:08,821 --> 00:55:10,350
of we are now.
Exactly.

1108
00:55:10,351 --> 00:55:11,184
We're always fighting her nature and it 
shouldn't surprise us that we're going 

1109
00:55:13,311 --> 00:55:14,144
to need to fight our nature with regard 
to responding to the Internet and 

1110
00:55:18,090 --> 00:55:18,923
responding to,
especially especially the little 

1111
00:55:21,270 --> 00:55:24,430
computers we carry around in our pockets
and you know,

1112
00:55:24,460 --> 00:55:25,293
learning to restrict our access to those
training ourselves to restrict their 

1113
00:55:29,701 --> 00:55:30,534
access to those.
And I think anyone with the ability to 

1114
00:55:32,551 --> 00:55:36,390
train themselves to meditate or to do 
anything on a regular basis should,

1115
00:55:36,540 --> 00:55:40,540
should be able to train themselves that 
same way with regard to devices.

1116
00:55:40,970 --> 00:55:43,690
All right,
well we've done about an hour here and I

1117
00:55:43,970 --> 00:55:46,590
was going to demand that you come back 
because I know,

1118
00:55:46,591 --> 00:55:47,424
I know we can do way more of this 
unfortunate just because my schedule is 

1119
00:55:49,021 --> 00:55:49,890
so nuts at the moment.

1120
00:55:49,890 --> 00:55:50,723
We have to kind of stop.
But can you give me one more thing that 

1121
00:55:52,561 --> 00:55:53,394
you're just really excited about right 
now that you've been thinking about or 

1122
00:55:55,951 --> 00:55:59,280
working on or anything else that's 
really just giving you a little bit,

1123
00:55:59,281 --> 00:56:00,114
uh,
a little bit of juice at the moment 

1124
00:56:01,321 --> 00:56:03,690
while you're in this interesting space 
for yourself?

1125
00:56:03,880 --> 00:56:04,770
No.
Um,

1126
00:56:04,950 --> 00:56:06,580
there are a number of things I guess.
Um,

1127
00:56:07,150 --> 00:56:07,983
there's a,
there's a piece I wrote a number of 

1128
00:56:09,841 --> 00:56:13,140
years ago that is supposed to be out in 
the literary magazine just about now,

1129
00:56:13,141 --> 00:56:13,974
ish about,
haven't been mugged at knife point and 

1130
00:56:16,651 --> 00:56:17,484
Quito at one of these on one of these 
study abroad trips which prompt and I 

1131
00:56:20,701 --> 00:56:23,590
was with three students.
Is Quito the capital of Ecuador.

1132
00:56:23,710 --> 00:56:24,190
Oh,
okay.

1133
00:56:24,190 --> 00:56:26,470
So it was,
it was the very,

1134
00:56:26,471 --> 00:56:29,800
it was before the first day of one of my
six week study abroad trips.

1135
00:56:29,950 --> 00:56:32,650
So 20 students just made.
Brent wasn't there on this one.

1136
00:56:33,180 --> 00:56:37,900
Um,
and the experience in which,

1137
00:56:38,320 --> 00:56:38,920
you know,
we'd been,

1138
00:56:38,920 --> 00:56:41,290
we'd been to get the three students that
I have been together all day.

1139
00:56:41,291 --> 00:56:42,124
We come to the top of the stairs and 
suddenly two guys with with knives run 

1140
00:56:47,141 --> 00:56:47,974
around the corner and pin me and my 
female student up against a wall and do 

1141
00:56:51,191 --> 00:56:54,400
this sort of knife dance in front of us 
and then relieve.

1142
00:56:54,401 --> 00:56:55,234
I didn't have anything on me because I 
know how to walk around Latin American 

1143
00:56:57,611 --> 00:56:58,444
cities and one of my students didn't,
but two of my students had all of their 

1144
00:57:01,301 --> 00:57:02,134
stuff taken off of them,
including this really nice dslr that 

1145
00:57:04,510 --> 00:57:09,510
Michelle and my student had and they run
off and the next thing I realize I am on

1146
00:57:14,471 --> 00:57:18,070
one of these guys in the middle of the 
street pulling on the backpack.

1147
00:57:18,071 --> 00:57:19,630
He's stolen from another one of my 
students.

1148
00:57:19,750 --> 00:57:20,583
Another one of my students has chased 
down the other guy and thought how did 

1149
00:57:25,361 --> 00:57:29,290
that happen and why is everything now so
loud and so colorful?

1150
00:57:29,890 --> 00:57:32,530
And I thought back immediately thought,
wow,

1151
00:57:32,531 --> 00:57:33,364
the entire experience that I just had 
was somehow in black and white and was 

1152
00:57:38,471 --> 00:57:40,910
without sound.
And so,

1153
00:57:40,911 --> 00:57:43,460
I mean,
it's an interesting long story that,

1154
00:57:43,540 --> 00:57:44,373
that I basically explored in this essay 
by going into and doing a dive into the 

1155
00:57:47,801 --> 00:57:48,634
literature on the nature of memory,
on the nature of sensory memory in 

1156
00:57:50,711 --> 00:57:55,150
particular and what it is that we can 
and cannot perceive in the moment,

1157
00:57:55,270 --> 00:57:58,960
what our brains take in,
why time seems to slow down.

1158
00:57:58,961 --> 00:58:00,940
So just to go back to our early 
conversation about time,

1159
00:58:01,240 --> 00:58:05,020
why 10 time seems to slow down in 
periods of intensity.

1160
00:58:05,021 --> 00:58:05,854
It's not that it time slows down,
but basically our frame rate increases 

1161
00:58:08,920 --> 00:58:09,753
and not only our frame rate increases,
but the amount that we remember and you 

1162
00:58:13,061 --> 00:58:14,470
know,
move into short term memory.

1163
00:58:14,470 --> 00:58:17,320
And then in this case into longterm 
memory increases.

1164
00:58:17,321 --> 00:58:19,990
So this is,
this is one of the things that I've been

1165
00:58:19,991 --> 00:58:24,520
thinking about lately is sort of how,
how memory and the senses and in fact,

1166
00:58:24,521 --> 00:58:26,200
how all of us are a little bit of 
synesthesia.

1167
00:58:26,201 --> 00:58:29,170
It's,
are experiencing our world in ways that,

1168
00:58:29,770 --> 00:58:30,603
that we don't usually have language for.
Not that it was the purpose of the 

1169
00:58:33,011 --> 00:58:34,300
story,
but how did this all end?

1170
00:58:34,510 --> 00:58:35,380
It ended.
We got,

1171
00:58:35,381 --> 00:58:38,320
we got the stuff back,
we got the stuff back,

1172
00:58:38,321 --> 00:58:39,154
and as soon as the student,
Jeremy and I gave Tracy these guys and 

1173
00:58:43,810 --> 00:58:46,150
got the stuff back.
Then the police showed up,

1174
00:58:46,820 --> 00:58:51,790
then doppler it up from the end and the 
whole were watching.

1175
00:58:52,090 --> 00:58:53,790
It was.
It was remarkable actually.

1176
00:58:53,860 --> 00:58:55,660
It was totally.
There was no one on this walk.

1177
00:58:55,661 --> 00:58:56,494
We'd send no one.
These two guys run up to US Magus 

1178
00:58:59,250 --> 00:59:00,083
runoff.
We give chase and then the entire 

1179
00:59:02,171 --> 00:59:03,004
neighborhood comes alive.
Suddenly there were hundreds of people 

1180
00:59:05,201 --> 00:59:05,891
there,
like,

1181
00:59:05,891 --> 00:59:07,210
where were you guys?

1182
00:59:08,610 --> 00:59:10,570
There's some sort of study to be done on
that.

1183
00:59:10,571 --> 00:59:11,740
Well,
I'm sure they've done studies on that.

1184
00:59:11,741 --> 00:59:13,780
You know when people see the bad thing 
happening,

1185
00:59:13,781 --> 00:59:15,850
but nobody calls the police and all that
kind of stuff.

1186
00:59:15,880 --> 00:59:17,200
Well listen,
it's been an absolute pleasure.

1187
00:59:17,201 --> 00:59:20,890
I'm so glad that we finally got to do 
this in person and we will do it again.

1188
00:59:21,230 --> 00:59:23,720
You guys can follow heather on the 
twitter.

1189
00:59:23,721 --> 00:59:27,770
She does tweet a decent amount,
but not a unhealthy addicted amount.

1190
00:59:27,771 --> 00:59:30,510
I would say it's at heather.
He hiding.
