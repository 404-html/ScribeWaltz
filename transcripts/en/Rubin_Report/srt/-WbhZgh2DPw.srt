1
00:00:02,910 --> 00:00:03,743
Naturally,
I have to start this week by talking 

2
00:00:04,711 --> 00:00:07,320
about the horrific attacks in Paris a 
few days ago.

3
00:00:07,590 --> 00:00:08,423
Sadly,
it seems to me that these attacks are 

4
00:00:09,511 --> 00:00:10,344
becoming all too common these days and 
each event continues in the path of 

5
00:00:13,771 --> 00:00:18,771
carnage and absolute savagery these 
Islamic extremists want to impose on the

6
00:00:18,781 --> 00:00:20,160
Western world.
Yeah,

7
00:00:20,161 --> 00:00:20,994
I did say Islamic extremist there.
I know that upset some and makes the 

8
00:00:24,091 --> 00:00:28,260
politically correct crowd uncomfortable,
but unfortunately the more we ignore the

9
00:00:28,261 --> 00:00:32,580
very set of ideas these people tell us 
that they're using to attack us,

10
00:00:32,581 --> 00:00:33,414
the more we actually strengthened them.
This is what my former guests 

11
00:00:35,830 --> 00:00:39,240
marginalized told me he refers to as the
voldemort effect.

12
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:43,050
Jk Rowling described this idea in the 
Harry Potter books as quote,

13
00:00:43,290 --> 00:00:47,850
fear of a name only increases fear of a 
thing itself.

14
00:00:48,390 --> 00:00:51,480
Are there any other ideas we should be 
afraid of talking about?

15
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:55,470
I can't think of any and I refuse to 
treat this one idea differently.

16
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:56,513
We can't be afraid of scary things,
especially in idea form because that's 

17
00:01:00,661 --> 00:01:01,494
how they will grow and morph right in 
front of our eyes and of course by 

18
00:01:04,981 --> 00:01:09,030
saying these people who committed these 
specific horrific acts,

19
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:10,073
whereas alarmist extremist,
it obviously doesn't condemn all 

20
00:01:13,321 --> 00:01:15,990
Muslims.
If at this point you can understand that

21
00:01:15,991 --> 00:01:16,824
distinction,
perhaps there's a cat video out there 

22
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:20,610
better suited for you than what we're 
doing here.

23
00:01:20,790 --> 00:01:23,700
I've mentioned a couple of weeks ago how
I'd like to move a bit away from talking

24
00:01:23,701 --> 00:01:26,190
about the regressive left.
While I still want to do that.

25
00:01:26,191 --> 00:01:28,860
I feel like the regressives are a lot 
like the mafia.

26
00:01:28,861 --> 00:01:31,320
The more I try to get out,
the more they pull me back.

27
00:01:31,321 --> 00:01:32,580
In.
Case in point,

28
00:01:32,850 --> 00:01:33,683
the response by many of the regressives 
immediately after the attacks was to 

29
00:01:36,991 --> 00:01:39,420
blame us.
Foreign policy rationalizing,

30
00:01:39,421 --> 00:01:40,254
we ourselves are to blame for the people
who chose to murder over 100 innocent 

31
00:01:44,401 --> 00:01:45,234
civilians.

32
00:01:45,390 --> 00:01:48,830
After talking to my last two guests,
Douglas Murray and Feisal site,

33
00:01:48,850 --> 00:01:49,683
all Matar,
I've come to believe this is an 

34
00:01:51,121 --> 00:01:51,954
incredibly dangerous and egotistical 
lead driven view of the world to the 

35
00:01:55,861 --> 00:01:58,620
regressives.
Everything revolves around us.

36
00:01:58,770 --> 00:02:01,830
People only do things as a reaction to 
us,

37
00:02:02,190 --> 00:02:03,023
so even though these terrorists say 
they're doing this in the name of 

38
00:02:05,131 --> 00:02:05,964
religion and point to the actual texts,
they approve it well according to the 

39
00:02:09,181 --> 00:02:10,014
regressives,
they just don't know what they're 

40
00:02:11,911 --> 00:02:13,560
talking about.
That said,

41
00:02:13,570 --> 00:02:14,403
as mentioned,
and as I've been saying repeatedly to 

42
00:02:16,711 --> 00:02:20,970
things can be true at once.
It can be true that there is an ideology

43
00:02:20,971 --> 00:02:21,804
out there,
a book written by men a long time ago 

44
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:27,660
that gives plenty of reasons to kill all
infidels,

45
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:28,853
and at the same time it can be true.
Our western foreign policy created 

46
00:02:32,281 --> 00:02:33,114
massive instability in their part of the
world and perhaps if we left it on the 

47
00:02:36,530 --> 00:02:39,030
power,
isis never would have arose.

48
00:02:39,330 --> 00:02:43,350
Every action leads to consequences.
Often unintended ones.

49
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:47,040
Sometimes America does good things.
Sometimes America does bad things,

50
00:02:47,220 --> 00:02:48,053
but thinking it's all about us,
all of the time seems more like how a 

51
00:02:51,931 --> 00:02:55,740
child would think of the world than how 
an adult would approach the problem.

52
00:02:55,980 --> 00:02:56,813
Of course,
none of this will stop the regressives 

53
00:02:58,261 --> 00:03:01,780
from laying blame solely on America and 
it's allies thus emboldening,

54
00:03:01,781 --> 00:03:05,260
both the extremists themselves and those
on the far right.

55
00:03:05,470 --> 00:03:06,303
I've been trying to have discussions on 
this show so people can see that there 

56
00:03:08,741 --> 00:03:09,574
are others out there who understand the 
nuance and complexity of these very 

57
00:03:13,511 --> 00:03:15,910
difficult issues.
We don't have all the answers,

58
00:03:15,911 --> 00:03:16,744
but we aren't afraid to have the 
conversations that most people won't 

59
00:03:19,181 --> 00:03:20,014
touch.
Let's pretend for a second that all of 

60
00:03:21,941 --> 00:03:22,774
the world's issues.
We're a hundred percent because of 

61
00:03:25,001 --> 00:03:29,080
America and we did exactly whatever it 
is isis would want us to do.

62
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:31,360
Would that make us any safer?
Actually,

63
00:03:31,361 --> 00:03:32,194
I'm pretty sure we do the exact opposite
by holding the Western world in a 

64
00:03:35,081 --> 00:03:35,914
perpetual hostage crisis with the same 
people who have an old text to justify 

65
00:03:40,071 --> 00:03:40,904
adjust to that final thought on this.
I'm really not trying to score cheap 

66
00:03:43,571 --> 00:03:46,390
political points here by constantly 
calling out the regressive.

67
00:03:46,450 --> 00:03:47,283
I'm trying to lay out a case to show you
guys that the left is in real danger 

68
00:03:51,101 --> 00:03:54,340
because of the regressives misguided 
head in the sand,

69
00:03:54,341 --> 00:03:56,620
politically correct brand of 
demagoguery.

70
00:03:57,010 --> 00:03:57,843
At the end of the day,
I blame these attacks on nobody other 

71
00:03:59,921 --> 00:04:00,754
than the sick,
twisted people who committed these 

72
00:04:02,711 --> 00:04:05,650
horrific acts of violence.
At the same time,

73
00:04:05,651 --> 00:04:06,484
I won't stop speaking up against the 
misguided ideas that will only bring 

74
00:04:10,211 --> 00:04:11,044
about more of these acts because we are 
afraid to look at the whole picture and 

75
00:04:14,411 --> 00:04:16,990
not just our narrow,
myopic view of the world.

76
00:04:17,140 --> 00:04:17,973
My guest this week is Sarah Haider.
Sarah is the cofounder of ex Muslims of 

77
00:04:21,401 --> 00:04:22,234
North America,
an organization which advocates for the 

78
00:04:24,881 --> 00:04:25,714
acceptance of religious dissent,
promote secular values and aims to 

79
00:04:29,021 --> 00:04:32,080
reduce discrimination of those who leave
Islam.

80
00:04:32,410 --> 00:04:33,970
Also,
according to her twitter bio,

81
00:04:33,971 --> 00:04:37,390
she is Pakistani by birth and American 
by choice.

82
00:04:37,391 --> 00:04:38,530
Sarah,
welcome to the show.

83
00:04:39,380 --> 00:04:41,570
Thank you for having me here today.
It's really good to be here,

84
00:04:41,860 --> 00:04:42,693
so I'm so glad we finally connected 
because we've been going back and forth 

85
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:49,930
for a couple of months and we seem to be
sorta swimming in the same circles,

86
00:04:50,590 --> 00:04:52,930
so to speak lately,
and I love that line.

87
00:04:52,931 --> 00:04:55,510
Let's just start with that line on your 
twitter bio,

88
00:04:55,511 --> 00:04:59,410
Pakistani by birth and American by 
choice.

89
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:00,610
Why did you put that in there?

90
00:05:01,250 --> 00:05:01,820
Well,
I,

91
00:05:01,820 --> 00:05:02,653
well,
in a lot of people don't know about me 

92
00:05:03,131 --> 00:05:04,770
is that I am an immigrant.
Um,

93
00:05:05,170 --> 00:05:07,420
and I think that's a big part of my 
story.

94
00:05:07,750 --> 00:05:08,583
And in addition,
I think that the American by choice 

95
00:05:11,951 --> 00:05:15,040
means a lot because there are so many 
things about America that I love.

96
00:05:15,041 --> 00:05:17,510
There are so many values that are,
uh,

97
00:05:17,540 --> 00:05:19,330
that are truly American that I think 
are,

98
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:22,570
are wonderful.
And in so many left wing circles,

99
00:05:22,571 --> 00:05:25,930
it's unfashionable to say anything 
positive about America at all.

100
00:05:26,260 --> 00:05:29,590
And I hope to be able to swim against 
that tide a little bit.

101
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:30,753
Yeah,
I'm pretty sure that as an immigrant 

102
00:05:32,681 --> 00:05:34,600
that's doing good things in this 
country,

103
00:05:34,601 --> 00:05:38,380
you're allowed to maybe kind of say 
something nice about America.

104
00:05:38,390 --> 00:05:39,520
Are you a neo con now?

105
00:05:39,910 --> 00:05:43,010
It was apparently if you ask certain 
people I am,

106
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:44,750
but uh,
I think that,

107
00:05:44,900 --> 00:05:45,733
you know,
it took me so long to be able to get 

108
00:05:47,001 --> 00:05:47,834
this citizenship.
I only got it this year and now I am 

109
00:05:50,031 --> 00:05:54,290
fully an American citizen and I feel so 
happy about it because this is a country

110
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:56,690
I know so much about and I've spent my 
entire,

111
00:05:56,691 --> 00:05:57,524
you know,
most of my life here and I feel so 

112
00:06:00,201 --> 00:06:01,034
strongly that I am part of the American 
fabric and I want to contribute to it 

113
00:06:03,620 --> 00:06:04,460
however I can.

114
00:06:04,670 --> 00:06:06,380
Yeah.
Well obviously I love all that.

115
00:06:06,381 --> 00:06:07,214
And where I really became familiar with 
you was back in May when you gave this 

116
00:06:10,221 --> 00:06:13,430
speech at the American Humanist 
Association,

117
00:06:13,580 --> 00:06:14,413
which was really brilliant stuff.
But I want to start first with a little 

118
00:06:16,581 --> 00:06:17,414
bit of your history.
When did you and your family come here 

119
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:20,353
from Pakistan?
When did you sort of have your secular 

120
00:06:22,491 --> 00:06:23,600
awakening,
that kind of thing?

121
00:06:24,590 --> 00:06:25,290
Well,
uh,

122
00:06:25,290 --> 00:06:29,220
I think I was about eight years old when
I came to America and I remember,

123
00:06:29,221 --> 00:06:32,760
I remember this being a very strange and
new country for me.

124
00:06:32,761 --> 00:06:35,910
I remember learning the language and I 
remember thinking it was very strange.

125
00:06:36,540 --> 00:06:37,470
Um,
I,

126
00:06:37,471 --> 00:06:40,590
I struggled a little bit in the first 
few years,

127
00:06:40,890 --> 00:06:41,723
but then there was so much about America
that I thought was just wonderful and I 

128
00:06:45,241 --> 00:06:48,060
mean these concepts that we have that we
take for granted,

129
00:06:48,260 --> 00:06:48,870
like,
you know,

130
00:06:48,870 --> 00:06:52,320
individual liberty and right to free 
speech and all these things.

131
00:06:52,321 --> 00:06:55,590
I mean,
these don't exist in any form in so many

132
00:06:55,591 --> 00:06:57,810
parts of the world.
So as that we have it,

133
00:06:57,811 --> 00:07:00,330
you know,
and I saw this with new eyes and hey,

134
00:07:00,331 --> 00:07:01,164
here you can say anything.
I mean not anything truly but in a way 

135
00:07:04,711 --> 00:07:07,590
that in a way that isn't just comparable
to anywhere else.

136
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:09,990
And uh,
so anyway,

137
00:07:09,991 --> 00:07:10,824
I became really immersed into American 
government and I thought it was really 

138
00:07:13,921 --> 00:07:15,670
wonderful the way that,
you know,

139
00:07:15,740 --> 00:07:18,300
the separation of powers,
the bill of rights.

140
00:07:18,301 --> 00:07:23,301
I thought that was just fantastic stuff.
And when I was about 16,

141
00:07:23,401 --> 00:07:25,020
15 years old,
uh,

142
00:07:25,021 --> 00:07:25,854
I began to have doubts about my faith 
and a lot of it had to do with actually 

143
00:07:30,811 --> 00:07:31,350
a,
I mean,

144
00:07:31,350 --> 00:07:36,090
just debating and seeing new viewpoints.
I was on the debate team that helped,

145
00:07:36,390 --> 00:07:39,120
uh,
what did push me a little bit,

146
00:07:39,121 --> 00:07:44,100
I think was meeting a,
what you would call a militant atheists,

147
00:07:44,101 --> 00:07:45,080
you know,
the obnoxious,

148
00:07:45,850 --> 00:07:49,890
the worst,
those militant atheist violence,

149
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:52,840
right?
And the people that get in your face.

150
00:07:52,841 --> 00:07:54,580
And,
and there was one guy in particular,

151
00:07:54,581 --> 00:07:55,414
I know a few,
but there was one guy in particular who 

152
00:07:57,341 --> 00:08:00,280
would print out verses from the Koran 
that were just horrible,

153
00:08:00,310 --> 00:08:01,600
right?
These horrible verses.

154
00:08:01,601 --> 00:08:04,300
And he would just hand them to me and 
not say a word and just be like,

155
00:08:04,301 --> 00:08:05,260
this is,
look at this.

156
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:08,530
And you know,
this was my first time really,

157
00:08:08,710 --> 00:08:11,920
really looking into it.
And I think this is the case for so many

158
00:08:11,921 --> 00:08:15,640
Christians and Jews and Muslims who 
leave religion that they were like,

159
00:08:15,641 --> 00:08:16,151
well,
you know,

160
00:08:16,151 --> 00:08:19,120
when I really looked into it,
it didn't make a lot of sense.

161
00:08:19,121 --> 00:08:20,680
Or there were some horrible stuff in 
there,

162
00:08:21,180 --> 00:08:26,170
and for me it was kind of a quest to 
prove these atheist wrong,

163
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:28,690
you know,
and uh,

164
00:08:28,691 --> 00:08:32,350
I started doing research online because 
I was sure that,

165
00:08:32,410 --> 00:08:37,410
that Islam was the way and as long was 
so good for women and women's rights and

166
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:41,050
all of this stuff could be explained 
when looked into context.

167
00:08:41,051 --> 00:08:43,480
And then I looked at the context,
sometimes I made things worse.

168
00:08:43,750 --> 00:08:45,640
So then I thought,
okay,

169
00:08:45,641 --> 00:08:49,360
well it's time to admit defeat.
And it didn't really take me a long time

170
00:08:49,450 --> 00:08:50,283
before I thought,
this just doesn't make any sense and 

171
00:08:51,911 --> 00:08:55,020
it's not honest for me to say that I am 
a Muslim.

172
00:08:55,230 --> 00:08:56,730
Given that I know all of this now.

173
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:57,673
Yeah.
I love that you described the militant 

174
00:08:58,790 --> 00:08:59,990
atheist.
What did they have?

175
00:08:59,991 --> 00:09:03,440
They had photocopied paper that was,
that was their weapon.

176
00:09:03,470 --> 00:09:05,380
You know what I mean?
The other extremists,

177
00:09:05,390 --> 00:09:07,130
they have some more serious stuff.
Like,

178
00:09:07,131 --> 00:09:09,110
you're going to get a paper cut.
That's pretty much going to be the worst

179
00:09:09,111 --> 00:09:09,980
thing that's going to happen to you.

180
00:09:10,530 --> 00:09:11,450
Right.
And it's just,

181
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:13,010
it's amazing.
To me that's all I had.

182
00:09:13,030 --> 00:09:15,280
That's all that it took,
really is just here,

183
00:09:15,310 --> 00:09:17,070
this was what you believe.
This is the book,

184
00:09:17,071 --> 00:09:18,690
this is your holy book,
this all the drug.

185
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:19,670
Yeah.
So when,

186
00:09:19,671 --> 00:09:24,200
when they showed you that and you looked
at this was your family,

187
00:09:24,201 --> 00:09:28,130
like how religious was your family?
How did your process of coming out,

188
00:09:28,131 --> 00:09:28,964
you know,
I've described this process that 

189
00:09:30,411 --> 00:09:34,640
atheists have to come out of the closet,
much like lgbt people do,

190
00:09:34,641 --> 00:09:35,474
that there is this hidden shame,
this feeling of the otherness and all 

191
00:09:38,151 --> 00:09:38,984
that.
How long did that take before you had 

192
00:09:40,281 --> 00:09:42,560
the realization versus when you told 
your family,

193
00:09:42,561 --> 00:09:43,520
your friends,
that kind of thing?

194
00:09:44,370 --> 00:09:47,640
Well,
so as far as that terminology,

195
00:09:47,641 --> 00:09:51,270
that coming out thing that's so common 
in Muslim circles,

196
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:52,193
that's,
that's what we used was that have you 

197
00:09:53,011 --> 00:09:54,510
come out to your like,
you know,

198
00:09:54,511 --> 00:09:55,680
do,
are you out of the closet?

199
00:09:55,681 --> 00:09:57,380
That is the language that we use because
that's the.

200
00:09:57,390 --> 00:09:58,920
That's the reality of it,
isn't it?

201
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:00,510
Yeah.
Well,

202
00:10:01,110 --> 00:10:01,943
what I,
what I did was I drew just have debates 

203
00:10:03,421 --> 00:10:06,630
with my family here and there about 
specific issues and that's how they sort

204
00:10:06,631 --> 00:10:09,900
of got the message.
I don't know if I explicitly said it for

205
00:10:09,901 --> 00:10:11,690
the first couple of years,
um,

206
00:10:11,910 --> 00:10:12,743
but I was lucky.
I'm very lucky in that I have a truly 

207
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:19,290
liberal father and by liberal I mean,
okay.

208
00:10:19,291 --> 00:10:21,300
I still wasn't allowed to wear certain 
kinds of clothing.

209
00:10:21,301 --> 00:10:22,134
Right.
I still couldn't wear shorts in the 

210
00:10:22,891 --> 00:10:23,724
house,
I still couldn't have boyfriends or 

211
00:10:26,101 --> 00:10:26,934
anything like that or date.
And I was expected to get an arranged 

212
00:10:29,371 --> 00:10:30,340
marriage and everything.

213
00:10:30,490 --> 00:10:31,800
Wait,
where's the liberal part coming?

214
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:32,400
It's coming,

215
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:33,630
but that's,
that's liberal.

216
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:36,060
It's liberal in the sense that he 
allowed me to.

217
00:10:36,090 --> 00:10:39,690
My father allowed me to read what I 
wanted to read and he didn't question it

218
00:10:39,691 --> 00:10:42,900
too much because he thought I would end 
up in the right place at the end.

219
00:10:42,901 --> 00:10:43,734
So that was a sense of freedom and I 
only had to fight for maybe a year or 

220
00:10:48,091 --> 00:10:50,640
two to be able to go away for college.
So that was,

221
00:10:50,641 --> 00:10:51,780
that was my liberal father.

222
00:10:52,230 --> 00:10:55,350
Got It.
So funny how it's so funny how terms and

223
00:10:55,351 --> 00:10:57,000
words really mean a lot,
you know,

224
00:10:57,001 --> 00:10:59,370
before you refer to,
as you say something nice about America,

225
00:10:59,580 --> 00:11:02,460
the left will say you're a neocon.
And in,

226
00:11:02,550 --> 00:11:06,360
and in this context you described your 
liberal father,

227
00:11:06,390 --> 00:11:07,223
but you know,
you couldn't wear shorts and that kind 

228
00:11:08,821 --> 00:11:11,850
of stuff.
And yet clearly within that space he was

229
00:11:11,851 --> 00:11:12,990
liberal.
It's amazing.

230
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:16,180
It was very liberal and he was very 
liberal in the sense that he,

231
00:11:16,330 --> 00:11:17,163
he gave me a sort of dignity as,
as a woman that I think that wasn't 

232
00:11:20,081 --> 00:11:20,914
given.
It isn't given by many Muslim men to 

233
00:11:22,781 --> 00:11:25,180
their daughters and to their wives and 
mothers.

234
00:11:25,630 --> 00:11:28,060
And so I,
I consider myself lucky.

235
00:11:28,061 --> 00:11:29,530
I,
I know that sounds interesting,

236
00:11:29,531 --> 00:11:32,260
but I do consider myself very lucky that
my childhood was,

237
00:11:32,650 --> 00:11:33,483
it was similar to maybe what very 
conservative almost fundamentalist 

238
00:11:37,121 --> 00:11:40,210
Christians would have and that I 
consider myself lucky that I didn't,

239
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:43,540
I wasn't forced to wear the hijab.
I did wear it for a short amount of time

240
00:11:43,541 --> 00:11:44,510
by choice.
Um,

241
00:11:44,890 --> 00:11:47,500
but it wasn't forced upon me.
Um,

242
00:11:48,250 --> 00:11:49,083
so it is,
it is interesting what we consider 

243
00:11:50,860 --> 00:11:53,020
liberal and what's considered liberal 
anywhere else in the.

244
00:11:53,470 --> 00:11:55,240
Yeah.
And that's one of the interesting things

245
00:11:55,241 --> 00:11:57,880
and one of the reasons why I wanted to 
talk to you because you know,

246
00:11:57,881 --> 00:12:00,160
there are so many stories you hear 
about,

247
00:12:00,161 --> 00:12:02,110
you know,
x Christians leaving,

248
00:12:02,350 --> 00:12:04,240
you hear about ecs,
Jews leaving,

249
00:12:04,241 --> 00:12:05,440
you know,
Orthodox Judaism,

250
00:12:05,441 --> 00:12:08,620
something like that were there then 
considered heroes on the left.

251
00:12:08,890 --> 00:12:12,730
They left this dogmatic conservative 
ideology,

252
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:14,073
but you don't hear about many people 
like you and I've recently connected 

253
00:12:16,661 --> 00:12:17,494
with a bunch and it's like you're so 
obviously standing up for the basic 

254
00:12:22,421 --> 00:12:24,730
liberal values that we all talk about 
all the time.

255
00:12:25,420 --> 00:12:26,090
Right.
It's,

256
00:12:26,090 --> 00:12:29,000
it's so bizarre to be in this space.
I mean,

257
00:12:29,001 --> 00:12:33,290
I feel strange that I'm here because I 
feel like we have enemies,

258
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:36,980
like people who just don't like what I'm
saying for one reason or another.

259
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:38,640
And my narrative is a,
it's a,

260
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:39,553
like you said,
a classical liberal one and it's 

261
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:42,333
something that on the face of it,
should it be something every liberal 

262
00:12:44,301 --> 00:12:46,280
should support.
But there is,

263
00:12:46,281 --> 00:12:50,390
there is such a tendency on the left to 
protect Muslims,

264
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:51,393
uh,
to protect them from bigotry and these 

265
00:12:52,281 --> 00:12:53,810
fears of bigotry I would say.
I mean,

266
00:12:53,811 --> 00:12:55,280
they're,
they're real right there.

267
00:12:55,460 --> 00:12:56,900
It's not a,
it's not,

268
00:12:56,930 --> 00:12:58,370
they're not making this up.
It is,

269
00:12:58,371 --> 00:13:00,520
it is a fear and it's a real fear.
Uh,

270
00:13:00,530 --> 00:13:03,620
but the response has been what I would 
call a reactionary.

271
00:13:03,621 --> 00:13:05,360
It's interesting because they say the 
reactionary,

272
00:13:05,361 --> 00:13:06,194
right.
And I think what would be your response 

273
00:13:07,431 --> 00:13:08,264
to Islam is also very reactionary.
You're also not looking at it from an 

274
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:11,930
objective point of view.

275
00:13:12,050 --> 00:13:12,883
Yeah.
Well it seems to me we've got the 

276
00:13:13,401 --> 00:13:15,740
reactionary right and the regressive 
left.

277
00:13:15,770 --> 00:13:16,603
But I want to hold that for a second 
because I want to talk about the speech 

278
00:13:18,950 --> 00:13:19,783
that you gave because it was really 
wonderful and I saw a blowing up on 

279
00:13:21,981 --> 00:13:22,814
twitter and a zillion people were 
sending it to me and I watched it again 

280
00:13:24,801 --> 00:13:28,370
yesterday in preparation for this.
And you know,

281
00:13:28,371 --> 00:13:30,230
we talk about this coming out process,
but I,

282
00:13:30,231 --> 00:13:33,290
you sort of referenced that in this.
It seemed to me like,

283
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:36,110
obviously without knowing you,
and this is the first time we spoke,

284
00:13:36,290 --> 00:13:41,000
but it seemed like your entire life had 
led up to that very moment.

285
00:13:41,001 --> 00:13:42,530
Am I being very dramatic there?

286
00:13:43,470 --> 00:13:45,470
Um,
well I.

287
00:13:45,470 --> 00:13:48,240
It was something that I was extremely 
nervous doing it.

288
00:13:48,260 --> 00:13:48,951
I mean,
and I don't know,

289
00:13:48,951 --> 00:13:49,784
I think it showed in the video that I 
showed that I was nervous and I was 

290
00:13:52,790 --> 00:13:55,490
because I felt um,
ever since I've been doing this activism

291
00:13:55,491 --> 00:13:58,610
now it's been three years that I've been
doing x Muslim activism.

292
00:13:59,300 --> 00:14:02,930
I am blind sided by the reaction of the 
left.

293
00:14:03,140 --> 00:14:04,310
I really thought,
you know,

294
00:14:04,311 --> 00:14:05,144
and this is something that I hear from 
activists everywhere I hear that they 

295
00:14:07,791 --> 00:14:10,430
thought they would come here and they 
will talk to people on the left and they

296
00:14:10,431 --> 00:14:11,264
would find allies.
I would find people who are willing to 

297
00:14:12,891 --> 00:14:13,724
support them and we're willing to give 
at least moral support if not anything 

298
00:14:16,461 --> 00:14:18,170
else,
but they would find their brothers.

299
00:14:18,470 --> 00:14:19,303
And I found it in so many ways.
People I considered my brothers and my 

300
00:14:22,521 --> 00:14:24,710
sisters in the struggle.

301
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:30,020
I have overlooked me for what seems like
a very political,

302
00:14:30,021 --> 00:14:33,240
very,
very political reason and the,

303
00:14:33,770 --> 00:14:35,030
what I was feeling,
um,

304
00:14:35,060 --> 00:14:36,890
especially around the time I was giving 
that speech,

305
00:14:37,430 --> 00:14:42,260
it was after the Charlie Hebdo shootings
and I was feeling extremely disheartened

306
00:14:42,590 --> 00:14:43,423
by the sec,
even the secular community overall that 

307
00:14:45,921 --> 00:14:47,330
there are so many people that were 
saying,

308
00:14:47,331 --> 00:14:47,871
well,
you know,

309
00:14:47,871 --> 00:14:48,704
they,
that in some ways it can be justified 

310
00:14:51,140 --> 00:14:54,020
and Islamophobia,
Islamophobia and all this stuff.

311
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:55,033
It didn't really make a lot of sense and
I was feeling abandoned and so I 

312
00:14:58,131 --> 00:14:58,970
thought,
you know,

313
00:14:58,971 --> 00:15:00,830
they gave me this opportunity to have 
the speech,

314
00:15:00,831 --> 00:15:04,400
so I'm going to just speak my mind.
I think maybe they expected me to talk a

315
00:15:04,401 --> 00:15:06,590
little bit more,
mostly about my organization,

316
00:15:06,591 --> 00:15:09,740
but I ended up sort of hijacking that 
conversation and talking about that.

317
00:15:10,030 --> 00:15:10,710
Yeah.
Well,

318
00:15:10,710 --> 00:15:11,543
first off,
I mean I recommend that everyone that's 

319
00:15:12,631 --> 00:15:13,464
watching this should absolutely watch 
that because we can only touch on some 

320
00:15:16,471 --> 00:15:18,270
of what you,
what you did there,

321
00:15:18,870 --> 00:15:21,390
but the reaction from the left,
uh,

322
00:15:21,391 --> 00:15:23,610
you know,
it's a lot of what we've spent this show

323
00:15:23,611 --> 00:15:27,030
talking about and the more that I try to
get away from it,

324
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:29,160
you know,
I've tried to address it so that I could

325
00:15:29,161 --> 00:15:29,994
move away from it.
I want these people to understand that 

326
00:15:32,521 --> 00:15:34,700
someone like you,
but someone like me,

327
00:15:34,710 --> 00:15:37,170
that we are standing up for liberal 
values,

328
00:15:37,290 --> 00:15:40,020
but it's not just that they've ignored 
you in a lot of ways.

329
00:15:40,021 --> 00:15:43,290
These people have sort of actively tried
to undermined you,

330
00:15:43,291 --> 00:15:44,124
don't you think?

331
00:15:44,330 --> 00:15:45,730
Right?
And then there is.

332
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:48,120
It's not just undermining,
its,

333
00:15:48,121 --> 00:15:49,340
its sliming.
Right?

334
00:15:49,341 --> 00:15:52,520
And there's people that have questioned 
my agenda and what am I,

335
00:15:52,550 --> 00:15:53,690
what am I doing this for?
I mean,

336
00:15:53,691 --> 00:15:54,830
I don't know,
I don't,

337
00:15:54,831 --> 00:15:56,810
I'm not gaining anything from this.
I mean in,

338
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:57,713
in,
in a lot of ways this comes at a high 

339
00:15:58,881 --> 00:16:02,060
personal cost and I think many Muslims 
that speak out.

340
00:16:02,370 --> 00:16:04,600
Um,
but there are so many people that are,

341
00:16:04,601 --> 00:16:05,434
that are very intent on painting me as a
right wing show and I get this all the 

342
00:16:08,931 --> 00:16:09,764
time and I even get this from people who
I thought would be my allies from 

343
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:13,880
atheists,
from leftists.

344
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:15,750
Um,
so it's

345
00:16:16,890 --> 00:16:17,723
that tactic,
just that general tactic that it's not 

346
00:16:19,861 --> 00:16:20,694
about what you say because if anyone was
to listen to that speech or hopefully 

347
00:16:24,391 --> 00:16:25,950
anything that we're going to talk about 
here,

348
00:16:26,550 --> 00:16:27,383
I'm going to guess that you're going to 
line up with liberal values 99 percent 

349
00:16:30,121 --> 00:16:32,430
of the time.
So it's rarely about what you say.

350
00:16:32,730 --> 00:16:37,120
It's about who you are and that you 
don't fit into their neat little box of,

351
00:16:37,190 --> 00:16:39,900
of what a Muslim should believe.
Which is crazy to me.

352
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:42,760
Well,
I actually disagree with it.

353
00:16:42,770 --> 00:16:43,603
I think it is what you say in the sense 
that if you're talking negatively about 

354
00:16:46,861 --> 00:16:48,420
Islam at all,
at all,

355
00:16:48,690 --> 00:16:49,523
on any perspective,
it is better if you're fueled by human 

356
00:16:51,871 --> 00:16:53,370
rights are fueled by bigotry,
whatever.

357
00:16:53,371 --> 00:16:57,780
It doesn't matter if you are touching 
negatively on Islam on any level,

358
00:16:57,900 --> 00:17:01,920
you are a bigot matter how you say it 
because a lot of people say this to me.

359
00:17:01,921 --> 00:17:02,760
They say,
well,

360
00:17:02,761 --> 00:17:05,340
what would you tell you know,
Richard Dawkins,

361
00:17:05,530 --> 00:17:06,340
Sam Harris,
you know,

362
00:17:06,340 --> 00:17:07,173
I think there's a way they can say their
critique a that would be beneficial and 

363
00:17:12,031 --> 00:17:15,120
what I tell them is,
or when I ask them instead is,

364
00:17:15,450 --> 00:17:16,283
well,
can you think of somebody who has 

365
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:18,353
directly a critique Islam and in a 
direct way that has gotten away with it 

366
00:17:24,120 --> 00:17:26,790
that hasn't been called a bigot by some,
you know,

367
00:17:26,791 --> 00:17:27,690
how do you,
how,

368
00:17:27,691 --> 00:17:31,290
what is the right way of saying this 
point me to an example of somebody who's

369
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:34,140
critiquing Islam and it has been able 
to,

370
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:34,993
you know,
get away and still retain their liberal 

371
00:17:36,841 --> 00:17:37,530
credentials.

372
00:17:37,530 --> 00:17:38,363
Yeah.
And that's the part of this that drives 

373
00:17:39,451 --> 00:17:40,710
me nuts because,
you know,

374
00:17:40,820 --> 00:17:42,360
when I started the show only a couple 
months ago,

375
00:17:42,361 --> 00:17:45,870
my intention was not to talk about this 
stuff this much,

376
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:46,913
but as I said,
I can't get out of it because as a 

377
00:17:49,711 --> 00:17:54,060
liberal I see people like you and I say 
this is,

378
00:17:54,090 --> 00:17:57,000
this is the very people,
regardless of your religion,

379
00:17:57,001 --> 00:17:59,010
if you were an ex Christian,
as I said,

380
00:17:59,011 --> 00:17:59,844
or if you were an issue,
I would feel the same way about the 

381
00:18:01,741 --> 00:18:04,140
principles that you're standing up for.
So,

382
00:18:04,141 --> 00:18:04,521
you know,
I,

383
00:18:04,521 --> 00:18:05,354
I laid out some principles when we 
started the show that I wasn't going to 

384
00:18:06,931 --> 00:18:11,190
talk about people that much specific 
people except in this space.

385
00:18:11,191 --> 00:18:13,800
There have been a couple people that 
have,

386
00:18:13,890 --> 00:18:14,723
have acted really,
really dishonesty and I read just a 

387
00:18:17,521 --> 00:18:18,354
couple of days ago a piece that you 
wrote about some of the stuff that Reza 

388
00:18:21,660 --> 00:18:22,493
Aslan has said and I find him to be a 
profoundly dishonest player in this 

389
00:18:27,091 --> 00:18:29,670
space.
And I see what he's done to Sam Harris.

390
00:18:29,671 --> 00:18:31,800
Most of my audience knows about all of 
that already.

391
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:34,500
Can you explain a little bit about what 
your,

392
00:18:34,740 --> 00:18:36,150
what your stuff is with him?

393
00:18:37,350 --> 00:18:38,460
Well,
so this was,

394
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:39,960
um,
in response to,

395
00:18:39,961 --> 00:18:42,300
I wrote,
I co wrote a piece with Muhammad,

396
00:18:42,301 --> 00:18:44,820
say who's also works with ex Muslims in 
North America.

397
00:18:45,350 --> 00:18:45,961
Uh,
there was,

398
00:18:45,961 --> 00:18:49,830
there a CNN clip that's been going 
around and it's making rounds again.

399
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:50,753
I have the CNN clip where Reza Aslan is 
on and he talks about fgm and he talks 

400
00:18:56,521 --> 00:19:01,450
about Bill Maher and it talks about how 
a fgm isn't an,

401
00:19:01,860 --> 00:19:04,880
isn't a Muslim problem.
It's an African problem.

402
00:19:04,910 --> 00:19:05,040
Okay.

403
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:07,740
Female genital mutilation,
we should just say it for the few people

404
00:19:07,741 --> 00:19:09,020
that may not,
right?

405
00:19:09,460 --> 00:19:10,330
Yeah.
And he and he,

406
00:19:10,331 --> 00:19:11,220
and then he,
um,

407
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:13,860
he puts a few other things out there,
uh,

408
00:19:13,940 --> 00:19:17,280
as evidence that I'm Muslim.
Majority countries are actually not that

409
00:19:17,281 --> 00:19:18,400
bad for women.
Uh,

410
00:19:18,420 --> 00:19:19,081
including,
you know,

411
00:19:19,081 --> 00:19:22,650
there are some women that are heads of 
state and et Cetera.

412
00:19:23,340 --> 00:19:25,320
Um,
so I wrote a piece about it.

413
00:19:25,321 --> 00:19:26,154
A Co wrote a piece about it and publish 
it on the friendly atheist and it got 

414
00:19:30,230 --> 00:19:33,270
this big response because I feel like 
there were some people that,

415
00:19:33,370 --> 00:19:34,203
a good amount of people that were 
wanting somebody to pick up on these 

416
00:19:36,691 --> 00:19:37,524
things that they felt like weren't true,
but they couldn't say this and we said 

417
00:19:41,471 --> 00:19:45,360
it and we laid it out there and we laid 
it out very clearly about why the points

418
00:19:45,361 --> 00:19:48,720
that he was making were dishonest at 
the,

419
00:19:48,850 --> 00:19:49,830
you know,
at the least.

420
00:19:49,831 --> 00:19:52,230
And I think in a lot of ways he's aware 
of what he's doing.

421
00:19:52,230 --> 00:19:55,020
So he said,
he said many times that,

422
00:19:55,021 --> 00:19:56,410
um,
you know,

423
00:19:56,430 --> 00:19:57,263
Mohammed,
he said something to the extent of how 

424
00:19:58,891 --> 00:19:59,724
Mohammed freed the slaves.
He said things in that vein quite a few 

425
00:20:03,841 --> 00:20:06,150
times and they're just extremely 
dishonest.

426
00:20:06,151 --> 00:20:08,130
That is not true.
It's just not true.

427
00:20:08,370 --> 00:20:09,203
I'm,
all Mohammed did was say that you can't 

428
00:20:10,351 --> 00:20:12,630
enslave another Muslim.
And there are many people,

429
00:20:12,631 --> 00:20:13,464
many scholars who think that this 
actually encouraged the spread of the 

430
00:20:16,471 --> 00:20:17,304
slave trade because suddenly you're in 
Arabia and you can't slave enslave 

431
00:20:20,100 --> 00:20:20,933
another Muslim.
So you have to go out and you have 

432
00:20:22,650 --> 00:20:23,483
record on,
you have to go to various places to get 

433
00:20:24,871 --> 00:20:26,330
your slaves.
He did that.

434
00:20:26,430 --> 00:20:28,500
He didn't condemn slavery.
He had slaves,

435
00:20:28,501 --> 00:20:33,501
he had sex slaves and so there.
And supposedly Reza Aslan is a scholar.

436
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:34,513
Uh,
I don't even know about that whole 

437
00:20:34,871 --> 00:20:35,590
thing.
I can't,

438
00:20:35,590 --> 00:20:37,900
I can't waste any more brain cells on 
that guy basically.

439
00:20:38,310 --> 00:20:39,790
Right.
It's just so it's,

440
00:20:39,810 --> 00:20:41,520
it's very frustrating.
And talking about Reza,

441
00:20:41,540 --> 00:20:42,373
Aslan,
I'm getting tired of it myself just to 

442
00:20:43,441 --> 00:20:44,101
see that,
oh,

443
00:20:44,101 --> 00:20:46,160
he's just,
he just make stuff up sometimes.

444
00:20:46,380 --> 00:20:47,980
Do you think that's part of the reason I

445
00:20:47,980 --> 00:20:48,813
wanted to mention it because I knew you 
were going to be exhausted by talking 

446
00:20:51,131 --> 00:20:54,010
about it because it's like you write 
your piece and then you want to move on.

447
00:20:54,011 --> 00:20:56,350
And that's how I felt a lot with a lot 
of my interviews.

448
00:20:56,351 --> 00:20:59,260
I interviewed Sam and I wanted to move 
on to some other stuff,

449
00:20:59,261 --> 00:21:01,240
but then these guys just further the 
attack.

450
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:02,313
But do you think that that's part of it?
That they throw out what I would call 

451
00:21:06,431 --> 00:21:07,264
just basic bullshit,
or they throw out these lies in these 

452
00:21:09,371 --> 00:21:10,204
smears and then you have to spend a 
tremendous amount of your time and your 

453
00:21:14,681 --> 00:21:19,270
energy and your life force basically 
either defending yourself or,

454
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:22,090
or the honest critiques that you're 
making.

455
00:21:22,760 --> 00:21:24,980
Absolutely.
And I think this is the experience of,

456
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:25,873
of almost everyone who has critique 
Islam in any way in which is why we're 

457
00:21:29,061 --> 00:21:31,370
seeing that there's just a lack of it.

458
00:21:31,370 --> 00:21:32,203
There's just a lack of it everywhere.
I mean there's a lack of scholarship if 

459
00:21:34,611 --> 00:21:36,620
you try to,
to really study this.

460
00:21:36,621 --> 00:21:37,650
And I have,
um,

461
00:21:38,150 --> 00:21:38,983
there,
there isn't that much out there that is 

462
00:21:40,311 --> 00:21:41,144
truly secular,
that is looking at it from a very 

463
00:21:42,860 --> 00:21:44,330
outsider's perspective.
Um,

464
00:21:44,630 --> 00:21:45,463
there were some efforts to do so,
but they've now been painted as 

465
00:21:48,020 --> 00:21:51,770
orientalist and therefore bad and 
therefore right wing of course.

466
00:21:51,910 --> 00:21:53,270
So,
and so there's,

467
00:21:53,330 --> 00:21:57,110
that study sort of stopped around the 
time that those smears began.

468
00:21:57,111 --> 00:21:57,944
Um,
and those associations with this 

469
00:21:59,540 --> 00:22:00,373
bigotry,
if you're going to conflate this with 

470
00:22:01,461 --> 00:22:03,920
any kind of negative,
any kind of negative anything.

471
00:22:04,370 --> 00:22:05,510
Um,
so it's,

472
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:06,433
I think it's,
it's really unfortunate because a 

473
00:22:08,151 --> 00:22:11,680
scholarly pursuit of looking into,
you know,

474
00:22:11,681 --> 00:22:13,610
what Islam is,
how did it begin,

475
00:22:13,611 --> 00:22:15,410
what Muhammad did,
all of that.

476
00:22:15,411 --> 00:22:16,460
I mean,
that has just,

477
00:22:16,610 --> 00:22:17,443
it's suffered,
it's suffered tremendously because of 

478
00:22:19,370 --> 00:22:23,480
people's fears of being seen as a bigot,
racist,

479
00:22:23,481 --> 00:22:24,500
whatever.
So a lot of,

480
00:22:24,530 --> 00:22:27,230
I think a lot of people haven't,
haven't really reached out,

481
00:22:27,231 --> 00:22:29,210
haven't really said the things that they
want to say,

482
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:32,570
reveal the knowledge that they had or 
even looked into it further if they want

483
00:22:32,571 --> 00:22:34,550
it to,
because if they're thinking,

484
00:22:34,730 --> 00:22:36,380
well,
this is going to destroy my career.

485
00:22:36,381 --> 00:22:37,214
What's the point?

486
00:22:37,240 --> 00:22:39,040
Yeah,
and doesn't some of that,

487
00:22:39,070 --> 00:22:41,710
that fear of speaking out about this 
stuff,

488
00:22:41,980 --> 00:22:45,130
doesn't that actually show what real 
bigotry is?

489
00:22:45,220 --> 00:22:46,053
If you're afraid to speak out about 
something because you think it's going 

490
00:22:49,301 --> 00:22:53,260
to lead to dishonest smearing of you,
or really what it's about is violence to

491
00:22:53,261 --> 00:22:54,094
you.
That's what people clearly are really 

492
00:22:55,301 --> 00:22:55,781
afraid.
I mean,

493
00:22:55,781 --> 00:22:56,614
I get emails now every day literally 
from all over the world that people are 

494
00:22:59,771 --> 00:23:00,604
afraid to speak out.
So the real bigotry is saying we're not 

495
00:23:04,061 --> 00:23:05,830
going to talk about these people because
guess what,

496
00:23:05,831 --> 00:23:09,160
they can't control their violent 
tendencies or something like that.

497
00:23:09,161 --> 00:23:09,780
Right.

498
00:23:09,780 --> 00:23:10,970
All right.
Well,

499
00:23:10,971 --> 00:23:12,740
it's interesting because a lot of people
said this about,

500
00:23:12,770 --> 00:23:14,810
about the Charlie Hebdo cartoonists.
They said,

501
00:23:14,811 --> 00:23:16,460
well,
they should've seen it coming

502
00:23:16,750 --> 00:23:18,580
that John Kerry,
John Kerry,

503
00:23:18,700 --> 00:23:20,940
our secretary of state just in the last 
day or so,

504
00:23:21,310 --> 00:23:22,420
said basically,
you know,

505
00:23:22,421 --> 00:23:24,940
there was some sort of rationalization.
It's unbelievable.

506
00:23:25,450 --> 00:23:27,540
It's absolutely unbelievable.
And to say that,

507
00:23:27,630 --> 00:23:31,380
that you have it coming when you were 
exercising a right exercising or right.

508
00:23:31,381 --> 00:23:33,180
That is given to you in the country that
you live in.

509
00:23:33,181 --> 00:23:36,480
What's the point of having a right.
If I can't test it to its extremes,

510
00:23:36,481 --> 00:23:37,314
that's the point.
And in a lot of ways what Charlie Hebdo 

511
00:23:39,571 --> 00:23:41,100
did for example,
was not that extreme,

512
00:23:41,370 --> 00:23:41,700
um,
it,

513
00:23:41,700 --> 00:23:42,533
it was exactly the same treatment that 
they were giving Christianity and they 

514
00:23:44,671 --> 00:23:47,150
were giving that exact same treatment 
to,

515
00:23:47,190 --> 00:23:50,000
to Islam.
So to me it seemed like they were,

516
00:23:50,180 --> 00:23:52,370
they were making it fair.
There were saying that,

517
00:23:52,371 --> 00:23:53,204
hey,
we're not biased and we're gonna apply 

518
00:23:53,961 --> 00:23:54,794
the same,
the same scrutiny to all religious 

519
00:23:57,831 --> 00:23:58,664
forums,
and they did that and I thought they 

520
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:03,230
were very fair about it and then they 
smeared in so many ways.

521
00:24:03,320 --> 00:24:04,153
Yeah.
And not only did they do it out of a 

522
00:24:05,111 --> 00:24:08,690
quality where they made fun of Orthodox 
Jews and made fun of Christianity.

523
00:24:08,691 --> 00:24:10,910
I think I'm going to slightly butcher 
this,

524
00:24:10,911 --> 00:24:11,744
but I think it was something like 80 
percent were about Christianity when 

525
00:24:14,421 --> 00:24:18,770
they did cover is related to religion 
and only something like 10 percent we're

526
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:20,050
about Islam.
Uh,

527
00:24:20,051 --> 00:24:21,680
but um,
I don't quote me fully on that,

528
00:24:21,860 --> 00:24:26,020
but also what people fail to realize 
with Charlie Hebdo is that it was satire

529
00:24:26,030 --> 00:24:28,040
about the things that are wrong with 
religion.

530
00:24:28,041 --> 00:24:28,874
They weren't mocking Muslims as people 
adjust as they weren't mocking 

531
00:24:32,331 --> 00:24:33,164
Christians as people,
but they were mocking archaic age old 

532
00:24:36,051 --> 00:24:36,920
ideas.
Right,

533
00:24:37,480 --> 00:24:38,320
right.
Absolutely.

534
00:24:38,350 --> 00:24:42,420
And in many ways I think it can be seen 
as an anti racist publication and,

535
00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:45,190
and a lot of people made a lot of good 
cases for this.

536
00:24:45,191 --> 00:24:46,024
And it's difficult because we're English
speaking people and we don't really 

537
00:24:48,431 --> 00:24:50,590
understand the context of how,
how they,

538
00:24:50,620 --> 00:24:51,221
how,
you know,

539
00:24:51,221 --> 00:24:53,770
these publishers do what they do in 
France.

540
00:24:53,890 --> 00:24:58,300
But I think when you look at it from an,
from a very unbiased perspective,

541
00:24:58,301 --> 00:25:01,540
you'll find it.
There are anti racist in lot of ways and

542
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:05,410
it was horrible to hear people say,
well they had it coming because it,

543
00:25:05,560 --> 00:25:06,393
it made it seem not only that they were 
stupid for doing what they're doing 

544
00:25:09,731 --> 00:25:11,470
instead of brave,
which is what they were,

545
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:12,553
but,
but also that Muslims are beasts and 

546
00:25:15,191 --> 00:25:16,024
animals and we cannot expect them to 
behave in the same way we would expect 

547
00:25:19,751 --> 00:25:20,830
everyone else to behave.

548
00:25:20,860 --> 00:25:21,693
Right then.
That's what I mean about this sort of 

549
00:25:22,661 --> 00:25:23,494
soft.
I think this is what Bill Maher refers 

550
00:25:24,611 --> 00:25:26,770
to as the soft bigotry of low 
expectations.

551
00:25:26,920 --> 00:25:29,650
If you say anything about these people 
that's going to upset them,

552
00:25:29,920 --> 00:25:30,753
well then you have to just expect that 
they're going to kill you and that 

553
00:25:32,121 --> 00:25:32,954
that's crazy.
And also you would live in a constant 

554
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:38,050
hostage crisis with a certain set of the
population.

555
00:25:38,710 --> 00:25:39,610
Absolutely.
And that's,

556
00:25:40,030 --> 00:25:40,863
I mean,
that's exactly the feeling of I think a 

557
00:25:41,621 --> 00:25:43,320
lot of those people who tell you that,
you know,

558
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:44,880
I'm afraid to speak out,
it it,

559
00:25:44,980 --> 00:25:45,813
it is absolutely taking away from the 
humanity and Muslims too because it's 

560
00:25:49,631 --> 00:25:52,450
turning them into beasts that we cannot.
We cannot say,

561
00:25:52,451 --> 00:25:53,284
hey,
this is a standard that we expect from 

562
00:25:54,311 --> 00:25:55,144
everybody.
We expect you to be able to handle this 

563
00:25:56,710 --> 00:25:58,480
and that they listen to it.
And I,

564
00:25:58,700 --> 00:26:02,860
we actually haven't pushed it.
We actually haven't said that,

565
00:26:02,861 --> 00:26:03,694
hey,
this is totally acceptable and this is 

566
00:26:05,381 --> 00:26:06,214
totally what,
how we run things in the western world 

567
00:26:08,591 --> 00:26:09,424
and this is what we expect out of 
everyone who is here in the Western 

568
00:26:11,111 --> 00:26:12,490
world.
We expect you to respect this,

569
00:26:12,670 --> 00:26:16,660
especially not respond in a violent way.
And I haven't had that conversation.

570
00:26:16,740 --> 00:26:17,573
So is part of it simply that for the 
people that are the real Islamic 

571
00:26:21,690 --> 00:26:24,150
extremist,
they simply,

572
00:26:24,151 --> 00:26:24,984
at the end of the day,
no matter how much my friends on the 

573
00:26:26,761 --> 00:26:27,594
left want to blame everything on 
American foreign policy and all of this 

574
00:26:31,651 --> 00:26:32,461
stuff.
No matter,

575
00:26:32,461 --> 00:26:33,294
you know,
Boko Haram killed about 160 people last 

576
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:36,353
week.
It had nothing to do with American 

577
00:26:36,961 --> 00:26:38,070
foreign policy,
right?

578
00:26:38,430 --> 00:26:39,990
Um,
yet this is,

579
00:26:39,991 --> 00:26:42,150
they always blame everything on America 
and I don't deny,

580
00:26:42,151 --> 00:26:42,984
as I said at the top of show,
I don't deny that foreign policy is 

581
00:26:45,481 --> 00:26:46,314
mocked up a lot of things,
but this is where people on the left 

582
00:26:48,631 --> 00:26:50,970
just completely fail.
Right?

583
00:26:51,380 --> 00:26:52,670
Absolutely.
And I'm,

584
00:26:52,750 --> 00:26:53,583
I'm very,
I'm sick of hearing that colonialism is 

585
00:26:56,061 --> 00:26:56,894
to blame for all of this.
I'm sick of that one particular thing I 

586
00:26:59,151 --> 00:26:59,984
hear all the time that this is,
it's because of colonialism and it 

587
00:27:02,481 --> 00:27:04,880
doesn't really make any sense when you 
look into it.

588
00:27:04,970 --> 00:27:05,930
And again,
not to say,

589
00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:08,150
not to say that it colonialism wasn't a 
horrible,

590
00:27:08,210 --> 00:27:09,043
horrible practice.
I mean I'm from the South Asian sub 

591
00:27:11,041 --> 00:27:14,990
continent so we were colonized by 
England and it was horrible what England

592
00:27:14,991 --> 00:27:17,810
did to,
to South Asia and the effects,

593
00:27:17,811 --> 00:27:19,910
the long range effects it had on South 
Asia,

594
00:27:20,180 --> 00:27:21,013
but there are just so easy to throw away
the colonialism excuse when it comes to 

595
00:27:26,001 --> 00:27:27,260
radical Islam.
I mean,

596
00:27:27,261 --> 00:27:29,570
I mentioned two of these in my speech,
which is that,

597
00:27:29,810 --> 00:27:30,643
uh,
Muslims have been doing this sort of 

598
00:27:32,091 --> 00:27:32,871
thing,
violence,

599
00:27:32,871 --> 00:27:33,704
justifying violence in the name of 
religion since way before colonialism 

600
00:27:37,040 --> 00:27:38,510
ever came into the picture,
right?

601
00:27:38,511 --> 00:27:41,450
That it's existed for a long,
long time.

602
00:27:41,451 --> 00:27:43,880
And when you say colonialism was the 
only thing to blame,

603
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:47,360
you are denying that that whole history 
existed.

604
00:27:47,510 --> 00:27:50,540
But there were so many people that were 
oppressed in the name of Islam.

605
00:27:50,660 --> 00:27:52,730
It's happened before and it's happening 
again.

606
00:27:52,731 --> 00:27:53,860
It's the same sort of thing.
Yeah.

607
00:27:53,920 --> 00:27:54,753
Did you by any chance see a piece that 
feisal site on the tire put up a couple 

608
00:27:57,971 --> 00:27:58,804
of days ago on facebook where he,
he writes sort of a satirical piece 

609
00:28:01,420 --> 00:28:03,730
saying that he's,
he's playing this,

610
00:28:03,731 --> 00:28:07,120
this Muslim extremists saying,
this is why I'm doing it.

611
00:28:07,121 --> 00:28:07,954
I'm doing it for religion.
And it's basically this argument with 

612
00:28:10,181 --> 00:28:13,090
him and one of these regressive left 
these saying,

613
00:28:13,091 --> 00:28:13,421
no,
no,

614
00:28:13,421 --> 00:28:13,781
no,
no,

615
00:28:13,781 --> 00:28:15,250
it's not because of religion.
And he keeps saying,

616
00:28:15,260 --> 00:28:15,491
no,
no,

617
00:28:15,491 --> 00:28:17,050
no.
I'm doing it because of religion.

618
00:28:17,051 --> 00:28:17,884
And they go back and forth and going 
back and forth and at the end of the 

619
00:28:19,991 --> 00:28:20,421
guys like,
you know,

620
00:28:20,421 --> 00:28:23,980
what do I have to do to prove to you 
that this is in the name of religion?

621
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:25,420
I mean,
even after Paris,

622
00:28:25,421 --> 00:28:26,800
which I want to talk to you about in a 
second,

623
00:28:27,100 --> 00:28:27,933
the statement that these guys issued,
there was a lot of religious overtones 

624
00:28:31,301 --> 00:28:33,400
to it,
a ton of religious overtones.

625
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:35,740
It wasn't purely,
you know,

626
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:37,870
this bombing in Syria or whatever.

627
00:28:38,530 --> 00:28:39,010
Well,
it's,

628
00:28:39,010 --> 00:28:41,620
I mean,
it's astounding to me that at this point

629
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:45,010
anyone can deny that religion has 
nothing to do with it.

630
00:28:45,140 --> 00:28:46,810
I try.
I believe that every,

631
00:28:47,140 --> 00:28:49,120
that there was no one really,
uh,

632
00:28:49,150 --> 00:28:49,983
any serious intellectual will believe 
that this has nothing to do with 

633
00:28:52,840 --> 00:28:54,480
religion.
It has something you know,

634
00:28:54,490 --> 00:28:56,860
and you can even make the case that it's
a perverted Islam,

635
00:28:56,950 --> 00:28:57,783
but it is some aspect of Islamic 
theology that they have taken and then 

636
00:29:00,790 --> 00:29:01,623
perverted at the very least,
at the very least that they have done 

637
00:29:03,881 --> 00:29:04,714
that.
And I think that a lot of people play 

638
00:29:06,580 --> 00:29:07,413
just lip service.
They say that this has nothing to do 

639
00:29:08,981 --> 00:29:10,420
with the religion.
I don't think they believe it.

640
00:29:10,421 --> 00:29:13,540
I think this is in a lot of ways,
a very political move.

641
00:29:13,780 --> 00:29:14,613
Yeah,
so I mentioned this also at the top of 

642
00:29:15,731 --> 00:29:16,564
the show,
but if let's say magically the United 

643
00:29:18,910 --> 00:29:21,550
States and the West and and France and 
England and everybody,

644
00:29:21,551 --> 00:29:25,630
we all did whatever it is isis wants us 
to do.

645
00:29:25,790 --> 00:29:28,060
You know what I mean?
Pull out of that part of the world.

646
00:29:28,360 --> 00:29:29,193
Whatever else they might want us to do.
Do you have any reason to believe that 

647
00:29:33,341 --> 00:29:36,820
suddenly terror would stop or that 
things would get better?

648
00:29:36,821 --> 00:29:38,950
I actually would see it completely the 
reverse.

649
00:29:39,160 --> 00:29:39,993
They would own most be more to continue 
and I say that as someone that doesn't 

650
00:29:43,631 --> 00:29:44,640
even want to be there in the first.

651
00:29:45,290 --> 00:29:45,940
Right.
I,

652
00:29:45,940 --> 00:29:47,280
I agree with you.
I started,

653
00:29:47,310 --> 00:29:50,560
isis is a different animal and if they 
are,

654
00:29:50,561 --> 00:29:54,310
they are very strict about their 
interpretation and they look into things

655
00:29:54,311 --> 00:29:55,144
at,
in a very literal way and if they are 

656
00:29:56,651 --> 00:29:59,140
going to look into it as a,
in the way that,

657
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:00,033
you know,
Islamic thought has progressed about 

658
00:30:03,430 --> 00:30:06,380
what you would call the land of the most
of the believers in Atlanta,

659
00:30:06,410 --> 00:30:09,010
the nonbelievers,
they are religiously.

660
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:12,550
It's a duty,
so religious duty to do what they can to

661
00:30:12,551 --> 00:30:15,510
spread Islam to at the whole globe.
So they're not going to stop us there,

662
00:30:15,580 --> 00:30:16,413
told us they're not going to stop.
Why can't we just listen to them and 

663
00:30:19,660 --> 00:30:21,580
understand that they mean what they say?

664
00:30:21,700 --> 00:30:22,533
Yeah.
And that was the point of fizzles a 

665
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:26,440
piece.
And I got into a fight on twitter.

666
00:30:26,441 --> 00:30:27,274
I try not to fight on twitter,
but I got into a fight with one of my 

667
00:30:29,381 --> 00:30:31,570
friends on the left who kept saying 
foreign policy.

668
00:30:31,690 --> 00:30:33,640
And I kept saying,
listen to what they're saying,

669
00:30:33,641 --> 00:30:35,710
don't listen to me.
Listen,

670
00:30:35,740 --> 00:30:37,660
listen to what they tell you.
Um,

671
00:30:37,720 --> 00:30:38,553
so one more,
I just want to jump back a little bit 

672
00:30:39,671 --> 00:30:41,500
before we get into,
into Paris.

673
00:30:41,680 --> 00:30:42,513
So I want people to understand there's a
distinction between someone like 

674
00:30:44,171 --> 00:30:46,180
yourself that you consider yourself an 
ex Muslim.

675
00:30:46,181 --> 00:30:47,014
You are a nonbeliever versus some of the
reformers that are still either either 

676
00:30:52,391 --> 00:30:54,730
believers or that consider themselves 
Muslims.

677
00:30:54,731 --> 00:30:57,400
Someone like imagine new eyes.
Although he said to me that,

678
00:30:57,401 --> 00:31:00,520
you know,
he doesn't want to put up his version of

679
00:31:00,521 --> 00:31:03,160
Islam for anyone else but,
but there is a distinction there.

680
00:31:03,161 --> 00:31:03,994
So there's two brands of people that 
we're talking about that are trying to 

681
00:31:06,551 --> 00:31:07,384
help here.
Right?

682
00:31:08,780 --> 00:31:10,820
Do you mean like progressive Muslims 
and,

683
00:31:10,910 --> 00:31:11,743
and.

684
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:12,593
Well meaning meaning that there is,
there's your branch that's sort of ex 

685
00:31:14,971 --> 00:31:15,840
Muslims,
right?

686
00:31:15,841 --> 00:31:17,490
You fully,
you are an atheist,

687
00:31:17,491 --> 00:31:18,324
you don't consider yourself part of the 
religion versus there are some that are 

688
00:31:21,271 --> 00:31:24,820
trying to reform the religion from the 
inside is,

689
00:31:24,821 --> 00:31:27,330
is there any sort of interplay with you 
guys?

690
00:31:27,331 --> 00:31:29,670
Are Our people working together?
It's hard to tell.

691
00:31:30,360 --> 00:31:31,380
Well,
I think that,

692
00:31:31,890 --> 00:31:34,590
I think it would be intellectually 
dishonest for us to work together in the

693
00:31:34,591 --> 00:31:36,760
sense that truly our aims are different.
Yeah,

694
00:31:36,990 --> 00:31:39,210
I mean they're,
they're similar in some ways,

695
00:31:39,211 --> 00:31:40,044
right?
We want to make sure that we want to 

696
00:31:41,161 --> 00:31:41,994
decrease harm in the world.
We want to push a secondary result and 

697
00:31:44,671 --> 00:31:46,520
push human rights,
uh,

698
00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:47,433
promoted the best we can.
But our ways of going about it are so 

699
00:31:50,521 --> 00:31:52,950
radically different that I think that it
would be.

700
00:31:53,190 --> 00:31:53,580
I mean,
we're,

701
00:31:53,580 --> 00:31:57,870
I'm in contact with some of these people
and I respect them tremendously.

702
00:31:58,370 --> 00:32:00,300
You're doing wonderful things.
I disagreed with them.

703
00:32:01,700 --> 00:32:04,950
There is,
there is very little about Islam and the

704
00:32:05,100 --> 00:32:05,933
fundamentals of Islam as a Sam Harris 
says that I agree with on any level and 

705
00:32:10,381 --> 00:32:13,050
it's hard for me to find any beauty or,
or,

706
00:32:13,070 --> 00:32:15,960
you know,
compassion or all these wonderful things

707
00:32:15,961 --> 00:32:17,910
that we would ascribe to something so 
holy.

708
00:32:17,910 --> 00:32:19,710
I don't,
I don't find that in this text.

709
00:32:19,950 --> 00:32:20,783
So there isn't really.
I disagree with people when they do say 

710
00:32:24,241 --> 00:32:25,950
that I'm a little bit extremist,
you know,

711
00:32:25,951 --> 00:32:27,040
people say that,
well,

712
00:32:27,041 --> 00:32:30,240
you cannot expect everyone to just a 
apostatize all at once,

713
00:32:30,420 --> 00:32:31,960
but this is not what I'm pushing.
I'm,

714
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,140
I don't want them to somewhere else who 
apostatize all at once,

715
00:32:35,030 --> 00:32:35,863
but for me it would be intellectually 
dishonest to Google about it on any 

716
00:32:38,761 --> 00:32:41,570
other way.
And I actually think that there is,

717
00:32:41,571 --> 00:32:42,404
I mean,
it's atheism and secularism and 

718
00:32:45,670 --> 00:32:46,503
rethought.
I think we have a very strong critique 

719
00:32:48,680 --> 00:32:49,513
of religion,
something that is very internally 

720
00:32:51,111 --> 00:32:54,150
coherent and ethically coherent.
Um,

721
00:32:54,210 --> 00:32:55,043
and this case is one worth making.
And if we're talking about the 

722
00:32:58,071 --> 00:33:01,400
marketplace of ideas,
it's important that we show our side and

723
00:33:01,401 --> 00:33:05,150
we put the best case out there and the 
land where they'll land.

724
00:33:05,820 --> 00:33:07,350
So that,
that's really interesting to me.

725
00:33:07,351 --> 00:33:09,600
So in a weird way,
your,

726
00:33:09,601 --> 00:33:13,290
your brand here is a little,
is a little cleaner,

727
00:33:13,500 --> 00:33:14,333
let's say.
Then the people that are trying to 

728
00:33:15,331 --> 00:33:16,164
reform it from the inside,
and I don't sense that you're judging 

729
00:33:18,691 --> 00:33:23,691
them for that as much as it really is 
easier to make a case from your position

730
00:33:24,451 --> 00:33:25,284
because you're just saying,
I don't believe in thousand year old 

731
00:33:27,931 --> 00:33:30,780
books,
so I'm going to make a case based on the

732
00:33:30,781 --> 00:33:31,614
world as it is sort of and they're still
trying to negotiate and that's what I 

733
00:33:34,981 --> 00:33:37,370
see someone like Reza and where I say 
he.

734
00:33:37,380 --> 00:33:40,170
This is someone who's profoundly 
dishonest all the time,

735
00:33:40,350 --> 00:33:41,183
but I think he's trying to negotiate the
world with this religion and then it 

736
00:33:44,101 --> 00:33:46,440
uses a lot of words so nobody knows what
he's talking about,

737
00:33:46,560 --> 00:33:49,740
but your case is a lot cleaner.
Even even if I disagreed with you,

738
00:33:49,920 --> 00:33:52,170
I would understand the logic more 
sensibly.

739
00:33:52,860 --> 00:33:55,140
I do think that in the case of somebody 
like Raza,

740
00:33:55,150 --> 00:33:55,983
I think it is condescending towards 
other Muslims because I think some 

741
00:33:59,171 --> 00:34:00,260
people believe that.
You know,

742
00:34:00,280 --> 00:34:02,950
Muslims will never get there.
They'll never get to where you are.

743
00:34:02,951 --> 00:34:05,050
You're expecting too much.
I don't think I'm expecting too much.

744
00:34:05,250 --> 00:34:07,870
I think this is actually.
If I was allowed to make this case,

745
00:34:07,960 --> 00:34:11,320
most Muslims do not hear anything 
similar to what I have to say.

746
00:34:11,470 --> 00:34:14,380
They will never hear anything like this.
I think if they did,

747
00:34:14,500 --> 00:34:16,750
I think it would change things,
but they,

748
00:34:16,870 --> 00:34:18,430
we don't know yet.
Right.

749
00:34:18,431 --> 00:34:20,260
And we don't,
we don't know that that's the case.

750
00:34:20,260 --> 00:34:21,790
Right.
Well now you did this show with me.

751
00:34:21,791 --> 00:34:24,500
They're going to say you're working with
a Zionist Nazi and not.

752
00:34:24,501 --> 00:34:26,140
I don't know if this is going to help 
now either.

753
00:34:26,200 --> 00:34:30,790
Tell me a little bit about being a woman
in this space because you have a double,

754
00:34:31,120 --> 00:34:31,953
a double edge sword,
so to speak here because leaving a 

755
00:34:34,421 --> 00:34:35,254
religion,
any religion stuff but particularly 

756
00:34:36,521 --> 00:34:37,354
tough to leave Islam.
And then when you couple that with all 

757
00:34:40,391 --> 00:34:41,224
the stuff related to being a woman and 
being a secular woman in America in 

758
00:34:43,991 --> 00:34:46,110
2015,
isn't that easy sometimes a,

759
00:34:46,150 --> 00:34:48,490
how does that play into how you,
how you live?

760
00:34:49,220 --> 00:34:50,053
Um,
well let me start by saying there's so 

761
00:34:52,131 --> 00:34:53,710
many people that I'm connected to 
through my,

762
00:34:53,750 --> 00:34:56,240
through the organization and through 
meeting a bunch of ex Muslims.

763
00:34:56,241 --> 00:34:56,711
I mean,
I didn't,

764
00:34:56,711 --> 00:34:57,544
I don't think it'd be a stretch to say 
that I probably know more ex Muslims 

765
00:35:00,921 --> 00:35:03,860
then most people in the world now will 
ever know,

766
00:35:04,360 --> 00:35:05,480
but,
and,

767
00:35:05,550 --> 00:35:06,383
and what I,
what I hear consistently from a lot of 

768
00:35:08,391 --> 00:35:10,220
women that the reason that they left the
religion,

769
00:35:10,360 --> 00:35:11,193
it was because of the treatment of women
and a lot of it just didn't make any 

770
00:35:13,611 --> 00:35:15,830
sense and they didn't,
they didn't appreciate.

771
00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:19,330
They felt that they weren't being given 
the same kind of dignity as,

772
00:35:19,390 --> 00:35:20,223
as men.
And when they looked at it from that 

773
00:35:21,021 --> 00:35:22,340
perspective,
things changed.

774
00:35:22,341 --> 00:35:25,040
Feminism has to do with it,
which is very interesting.

775
00:35:25,041 --> 00:35:27,410
Why don't we talk about today is 
feminism here,

776
00:35:28,050 --> 00:35:28,883
but really found the feminist allies in 
the West that I thought I would find I 

777
00:35:32,331 --> 00:35:35,750
expected to for them to be the first 
people to run to my defense.

778
00:35:35,960 --> 00:35:39,120
And a few have but a small few.
Um,

779
00:35:39,121 --> 00:35:39,954
I ha.
I expected there to be a big rally with 

780
00:35:43,580 --> 00:35:48,030
the feminists from all over to come and 
talk about these issues,

781
00:35:48,031 --> 00:35:50,040
but I haven't found that to be the case 
at all.

782
00:35:50,041 --> 00:35:50,970
It's very disheartening.

783
00:35:51,070 --> 00:35:53,590
Yeah.
So what is that strange alliance because

784
00:35:53,591 --> 00:35:54,850
you see this all the time,
you know,

785
00:35:54,930 --> 00:35:58,270
a group like code pink that stands for 
women's rights and antiwar,

786
00:35:58,510 --> 00:36:01,900
you would think they would be standing 
for women's rights all over the globe,

787
00:36:02,230 --> 00:36:06,640
but instead they'll rant and rave and 
talk about Gaza.

788
00:36:06,670 --> 00:36:08,230
Meanwhile,
if they ever went to Gaza,

789
00:36:08,530 --> 00:36:11,260
I'm pretty sure that these women would 
not be treated particularly well.

790
00:36:11,350 --> 00:36:13,570
So this double standard just endlessly 
exists,

791
00:36:13,600 --> 00:36:14,200
Huh?

792
00:36:14,200 --> 00:36:15,100
Yeah,
absolutely.

793
00:36:15,101 --> 00:36:16,190
And I,
I think it's,

794
00:36:16,191 --> 00:36:17,770
it's,
it's very,

795
00:36:17,860 --> 00:36:20,920
like I said,
it's disheartening for one and because I

796
00:36:20,921 --> 00:36:21,754
was somebody that,
that feminism was a huge part of me 

797
00:36:24,011 --> 00:36:26,350
leaving religion.
It was a huge part of me,

798
00:36:26,380 --> 00:36:30,970
a fueling me and the women's rights 
causes a fueling me into my activism.

799
00:36:31,180 --> 00:36:35,440
It's been especially painful to see that
feminists are not always on my,

800
00:36:35,480 --> 00:36:36,060
uh,
on,

801
00:36:36,060 --> 00:36:36,893
on the same level as me.
But I have found is that there's a lot 

802
00:36:39,131 --> 00:36:43,630
of posts about women that say the Muslim
women that say that they're empowered by

803
00:36:43,631 --> 00:36:44,770
the hijab,
you know,

804
00:36:44,771 --> 00:36:46,690
and there'll be,
there'll be on feminist west websites.

805
00:36:46,691 --> 00:36:47,291
They'll say,
you know,

806
00:36:47,291 --> 00:36:51,010
I'm very empowered by this job and it's 
my political whatever,

807
00:36:51,340 --> 00:36:53,500
and you know,
to me it's,

808
00:36:53,740 --> 00:36:55,780
it's wonderful for that particular 
woman.

809
00:36:55,781 --> 00:36:59,590
If she feels that this is her choice and
this is what she wants to do and this is

810
00:36:59,591 --> 00:37:01,300
how she wants to live her life,
that's great,

811
00:37:01,720 --> 00:37:04,990
but a Muslim woman that's wearing the 
hijab up,

812
00:37:05,230 --> 00:37:10,230
making a piece like that is like a woman
in Nineteen Thirties America saying that

813
00:37:11,021 --> 00:37:12,490
I'm proud to be a housewife.

814
00:37:12,490 --> 00:37:15,550
I love staying home with my children.
This is exactly where I want to be.

815
00:37:15,810 --> 00:37:16,643
Well,
good for you.

816
00:37:16,720 --> 00:37:17,553
Maybe you do and that's wonderful.
It's good for you that everything in 

817
00:37:20,471 --> 00:37:23,470
society aligned with your desire.
Perfect thing.

818
00:37:24,110 --> 00:37:26,680
Oh you and now you get to live this 
wonderful life,

819
00:37:26,681 --> 00:37:27,514
but you have to acknowledge the 19 
thirties America women who may be 

820
00:37:30,611 --> 00:37:31,444
wanting to have a career weren't as free
to do so that there were so many 

821
00:37:34,541 --> 00:37:36,760
different factors that were making it 
very,

822
00:37:36,761 --> 00:37:40,030
very difficult for them to live the life
the way they wanted to.

823
00:37:40,150 --> 00:37:40,983
You have to be able to acknowledge that 
and then same way I want these hijabi 

824
00:37:43,481 --> 00:37:45,100
women to be able to acknowledge that,
hey,

825
00:37:45,101 --> 00:37:45,934
there's so many women who don't ascribe 
to these modesty codes and they aren't 

826
00:37:49,811 --> 00:37:51,700
free to live lives the way they want.

827
00:37:52,330 --> 00:37:53,250
Well,
and this again,

828
00:37:53,251 --> 00:37:56,370
this is why the left has put themselves 
in the regressive left,

829
00:37:56,371 --> 00:37:57,204
is put themselves in such a crazy box.
They should be defending women's 

830
00:38:00,990 --> 00:38:01,823
options.
They don't have to say you have to live 

831
00:38:03,451 --> 00:38:04,284
a certain way,
but they should at least give you the 

832
00:38:05,611 --> 00:38:09,750
options and that's also why they have 
been relentless on new atheists.

833
00:38:09,751 --> 00:38:11,370
So you get it.
Now as a woman,

834
00:38:11,371 --> 00:38:12,204
you get it as an ex Muslim.
I don't know if you identify 

835
00:38:14,131 --> 00:38:17,340
specifically with the new atheist with 
new atheism,

836
00:38:17,430 --> 00:38:18,570
you consider yourself a new atheist.

837
00:38:19,250 --> 00:38:20,840
What does that even mean?
I'm not sure exactly.

838
00:38:21,020 --> 00:38:23,240
Nobody.
Nobody really seems to know.

839
00:38:23,540 --> 00:38:25,820
The best way I can describe it now as 
our,

840
00:38:25,821 --> 00:38:26,654
at least as I've come to understand it,
is that it's an atheist who is finally 

841
00:38:29,361 --> 00:38:30,980
speaking up.
So for that,

842
00:38:31,160 --> 00:38:33,500
for that version,
that's what I would consider myself.

843
00:38:33,770 --> 00:38:34,820
Um,
but,

844
00:38:34,850 --> 00:38:35,683
but community,
the left really has been attacking 

845
00:38:37,390 --> 00:38:39,040
atheist too,
so you're on a,

846
00:38:39,070 --> 00:38:39,903
like a year,
like spinning and you got shot from all 

847
00:38:42,821 --> 00:38:43,654
sides.
Huh?

848
00:38:43,930 --> 00:38:45,730
I,
I definitely feel that way.

849
00:38:45,731 --> 00:38:46,564
I mean,
I don't want to talk about how big of a 

850
00:38:47,621 --> 00:38:49,810
victim I am because I don't like those 
kinds of politics,

851
00:38:50,130 --> 00:38:51,760
but,
but in general,

852
00:38:51,761 --> 00:38:55,660
I have felt that the people that on 
paper should be supporting me.

853
00:38:55,820 --> 00:38:56,653
Um,
and I looked into this actually as a 

854
00:38:57,911 --> 00:39:00,850
response to seeing the way that leftists
have reacted.

855
00:39:00,851 --> 00:39:01,684
I've started to do more research on what
liberal principles were and really 

856
00:39:04,090 --> 00:39:06,430
trying to get a grounding on what it 
meant to be a liberal.

857
00:39:06,700 --> 00:39:09,070
And I feel under Bill Morris said this 
so many times.

858
00:39:09,100 --> 00:39:09,933
He said,
I the real liberal and I think he's 

859
00:39:11,351 --> 00:39:12,400
right.
He's right.

860
00:39:12,401 --> 00:39:15,340
When he says he's a real liberal and I 
feel like I'm a real liberal.

861
00:39:15,510 --> 00:39:17,490
Yeah.
So you're not gross and racist.

862
00:39:17,491 --> 00:39:18,330
That's what you're telling me.

863
00:39:18,750 --> 00:39:22,170
Oh God,
that was so bad.

864
00:39:22,230 --> 00:39:24,060
That was so bad and honest.
Okay,

865
00:39:24,061 --> 00:39:24,894
here's,
here's what I was watching that I kind 

866
00:39:26,731 --> 00:39:27,564
of felt I'm going to get haters to this,
but it kind of or been Africa little 

867
00:39:32,161 --> 00:39:32,770
bit.
I kind of thought,

868
00:39:32,770 --> 00:39:35,040
oh,
it's cute that he's standing up.

869
00:39:35,340 --> 00:39:38,460
He thinks he's standing up for the poor,
oppressed minority.

870
00:39:38,610 --> 00:39:40,080
Right.
That's what he thinks he's doing.

871
00:39:40,081 --> 00:39:40,914
That's what he's really convinced that 
he's standing up for an oppressed group 

872
00:39:43,020 --> 00:39:45,120
and it's nice that he has good 
intentions,

873
00:39:45,121 --> 00:39:46,560
but it's nice.
I appreciate that,

874
00:39:46,740 --> 00:39:47,573
but he's so wrong and he's really 
hurting these same minorities and he's 

875
00:39:50,491 --> 00:39:52,530
not understanding exactly what's going 
on here.

876
00:39:52,950 --> 00:39:53,783
And it was very interesting in that 
particular scenario to see Sam and then 

877
00:39:56,791 --> 00:39:58,770
very emotional,
very,

878
00:39:58,771 --> 00:40:01,560
very emotional.
Ben Affleck and very calm Sam Harris.

879
00:40:01,700 --> 00:40:03,170
You know,
I think you'll find this interesting.

880
00:40:03,171 --> 00:40:04,004
I was discussing this with,
well first off I discussed it with Sam 

881
00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:09,860
himself,
but I also discussed it with Joe Rogan a

882
00:40:09,861 --> 00:40:11,600
couple of weeks ago on his show and I 
said,

883
00:40:11,601 --> 00:40:13,190
what you just said.
I said,

884
00:40:13,191 --> 00:40:13,551
well,
you know,

885
00:40:13,551 --> 00:40:16,970
I think he was trying to do the right 
thing and trying to.

886
00:40:16,971 --> 00:40:18,860
And maybe he got too emotional,
but you know,

887
00:40:18,861 --> 00:40:21,380
he was trying to stand up for the down 
trodden,

888
00:40:21,590 --> 00:40:22,423
that kind of thing.
And Joe said something that I now fully 

889
00:40:24,501 --> 00:40:25,071
believe.
I mean,

890
00:40:25,071 --> 00:40:26,870
he got me to change my opinion like 
that.

891
00:40:27,050 --> 00:40:27,831
He said,
no,

892
00:40:27,831 --> 00:40:28,460
he's like,
man,

893
00:40:28,460 --> 00:40:30,740
I know actors,
I'm around actors.

894
00:40:30,980 --> 00:40:35,450
They fate this so that everyone will 
just think they're so holy there.

895
00:40:35,451 --> 00:40:38,630
So benevolent.
They're so wonderful and all that.

896
00:40:38,631 --> 00:40:39,464
And,
and he was really convinced that that's 

897
00:40:40,971 --> 00:40:41,780
what Ben was doing there.

898
00:40:41,780 --> 00:40:43,660
But I don't,
I don't want to waste anymore.

899
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:47,860
A lot more time on that specifically.
Um,

900
00:40:48,740 --> 00:40:50,090
so the atheist stuff,
yeah,

901
00:40:50,091 --> 00:40:51,620
you're getting,
you're getting it from them,

902
00:40:51,800 --> 00:40:55,560
you're getting it from the other guys.
What can we do then what,

903
00:40:55,561 --> 00:40:58,400
what can secular people and free 
thinkers do?

904
00:40:58,401 --> 00:41:02,540
Because I know that people just by 
listening to this,

905
00:41:02,690 --> 00:41:03,523
a certain subset of people are going to 
say all the things that you laid out at 

906
00:41:05,601 --> 00:41:06,434
the beginning,
they're going to say that I hate 

907
00:41:07,581 --> 00:41:10,100
Muslims.
That you're a secret Zionist.

908
00:41:10,130 --> 00:41:13,430
All of this nonsense.
But what can we do?

909
00:41:13,431 --> 00:41:14,630
I guess just talk,
right?

910
00:41:14,631 --> 00:41:16,250
I mean,
it's really that the best we can do

911
00:41:16,410 --> 00:41:17,243
so I think just be intellectually honest
and I think that a lot of people 

912
00:41:20,531 --> 00:41:23,920
understand what I mean when I say that 
because people stop themselves.

913
00:41:23,921 --> 00:41:24,754
They want to say these things.
They have these opinions and the 

914
00:41:26,921 --> 00:41:29,950
reaction that I got to my speech at the 
American Humanist Association,

915
00:41:29,951 --> 00:41:33,990
the biggest reaction was you said what I
wanted to say you.

916
00:41:33,991 --> 00:41:36,590
You put the words that I was thinking in
my head,

917
00:41:36,591 --> 00:41:37,424
but I just felt like I couldn't.
I really couldn't articulate and I felt 

918
00:41:41,181 --> 00:41:43,880
trapped and you said those things.
So it felt like a release,

919
00:41:43,910 --> 00:41:44,450
you know,
for,

920
00:41:44,450 --> 00:41:45,283
for me to hear you say it for to hear 
somebody say it and I think that if we 

921
00:41:48,801 --> 00:41:52,460
can be brave and if we can talk about it
and especially liberals,

922
00:41:52,461 --> 00:41:53,294
it is very important that it is liberals
who stand up for this because we were 

923
00:41:56,441 --> 00:41:57,560
the compassionate ones,
right?

924
00:41:57,561 --> 00:42:01,140
Where the,
that really are keeping the harm of that

925
00:42:01,250 --> 00:42:02,083
of the people in place.
We are not forgetting about anti Muslim 

926
00:42:04,281 --> 00:42:05,690
bigotry.
That is something that is,

927
00:42:05,900 --> 00:42:08,570
that is obviously at the forefront of 
our minds.

928
00:42:08,690 --> 00:42:10,880
We know that because that's why we're 
not saying anything about this,

929
00:42:11,770 --> 00:42:14,090
of this harm,
so it is those,

930
00:42:14,091 --> 00:42:14,924
particularly those people that need to 
be speaking about the need to be making 

931
00:42:17,841 --> 00:42:19,310
this nuance discussion.

932
00:42:19,470 --> 00:42:20,303
Right,
and that's what it seems so obvious to 

933
00:42:21,901 --> 00:42:22,734
me that I don't have to twist my beliefs
to say the things that I'm saying to 

934
00:42:27,481 --> 00:42:28,314
you.
Everything that I'm saying to you and I 

935
00:42:29,191 --> 00:42:30,024
sense everything that you're saying to 
me is based in the same set of secular 

936
00:42:33,601 --> 00:42:38,010
principles that you apply to everything 
else and for some reason these guys want

937
00:42:38,011 --> 00:42:42,090
you to just be a little more careful 
when it comes to this set of ideas.

938
00:42:42,091 --> 00:42:42,924
But what I see as the real danger there 
is that if we don't speak up right now 

939
00:42:47,341 --> 00:42:48,174
and we're editing,
we're an extremely precarious moment 

940
00:42:49,921 --> 00:42:53,880
right now with everything going on in 
Paris and with Isis and all that.

941
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:54,833
That if we don't speak up,
we hand the future to the people on the 

942
00:42:57,151 --> 00:42:57,984
right.

943
00:42:58,580 --> 00:42:59,450
Absolutely.
They're.

944
00:42:59,470 --> 00:43:02,190
They're getting empowered by this 
because people are not stupid.

945
00:43:02,850 --> 00:43:03,683
We are seeing that there is this big 
elephant in the room that people we 

946
00:43:06,150 --> 00:43:08,070
cannot talk about,
that the media isn't talking about,

947
00:43:08,250 --> 00:43:09,083
what are we doing?
We're building distrust of your average 

948
00:43:11,161 --> 00:43:11,994
American citizen when they're watching 
their TV screens and they're not seeing 

949
00:43:14,431 --> 00:43:17,880
anybody but Fox News really talking 
about Islam in a way that,

950
00:43:17,910 --> 00:43:21,090
that feels remotely honest and it's 
horrible.

951
00:43:21,091 --> 00:43:23,970
It's horrible that we're,
we're giving this up to these people who

952
00:43:23,971 --> 00:43:27,480
really have some Zena phobic motives.
Maybe the,

953
00:43:27,490 --> 00:43:28,323
you know,
and we need to make sure that it is us 

954
00:43:30,570 --> 00:43:32,520
that are talking about this,
that are engaging with this issue.

955
00:43:32,730 --> 00:43:33,563
You can,
it's similar to I think what happened 

956
00:43:34,561 --> 00:43:35,760
with the tea party.
Um,

957
00:43:35,761 --> 00:43:36,594
I think there was some real hurt and 
some real pain right after the economic 

958
00:43:40,831 --> 00:43:42,870
downturn.
And I think a lot of people were feeling

959
00:43:42,871 --> 00:43:45,570
abandoned by their government and I 
think we could have,

960
00:43:45,780 --> 00:43:46,613
I even say now we could have seized on 
that moment and we could have made it a 

961
00:43:49,381 --> 00:43:51,930
populist progressive movement to take 
down,

962
00:43:51,931 --> 00:43:52,764
you know,
corporations or whatever it is we could 

963
00:43:53,881 --> 00:43:54,090
have.

964
00:43:54,090 --> 00:43:54,923
We could have harnessed it,
but instead we disdain those people 

965
00:43:57,150 --> 00:43:58,150
because they were,
you know,

966
00:43:58,470 --> 00:44:00,300
backwater bigots,
whatever,

967
00:44:00,301 --> 00:44:03,690
people who were very uncommon that they 
don't understand things in a nuanced,

968
00:44:03,691 --> 00:44:06,330
complicated way the way that everyone 
else does.

969
00:44:06,540 --> 00:44:08,700
And so we find it very easy to,
uh,

970
00:44:09,290 --> 00:44:11,490
to,
to just push them aside and dismiss them

971
00:44:11,610 --> 00:44:13,200
and look at what happened there.
Right?

972
00:44:13,201 --> 00:44:14,034
They became a political force that a lot
of people would say had done some harm 

973
00:44:17,910 --> 00:44:20,130
political spectrum.
So we don't want that happening again.

974
00:44:20,170 --> 00:44:21,003
Yeah.
I don't know if you saw my video about 

975
00:44:21,761 --> 00:44:22,594
it a couple of weeks ago,
but I said that the regressive left is 

976
00:44:25,090 --> 00:44:25,923
our tea party and I don't want what has 
happened to the right that has been 

977
00:44:29,651 --> 00:44:33,480
dragged off the deep.
I don't want that happening to my side.

978
00:44:33,481 --> 00:44:36,060
That's why I do think we're at this 
moment.

979
00:44:36,150 --> 00:44:36,983
Um,
so I know we only have a little bit 

980
00:44:37,771 --> 00:44:40,050
left,
but I do want to focus on Paris a little

981
00:44:40,051 --> 00:44:41,130
bit.
I know you're not a,

982
00:44:41,131 --> 00:44:44,610
you're not a terrorist,
a expert or something of that nature.

983
00:44:44,780 --> 00:44:46,590
Um,
but in terms of the,

984
00:44:47,260 --> 00:44:48,093
the human part of this,
that it sounds like a lot of these 

985
00:44:50,131 --> 00:44:53,250
people did grow up in Paris or in 
France.

986
00:44:53,251 --> 00:44:54,960
They grew up in the west,
some of them grew up in Belgium,

987
00:44:55,710 --> 00:44:58,470
but they grew up in western societies.
Um,

988
00:44:58,980 --> 00:45:01,590
what do you make of that kind of 
radicalization because,

989
00:45:01,591 --> 00:45:02,424
you know,
I know a lot of the debate right now is 

990
00:45:03,151 --> 00:45:03,984
about can we let refugees in,
are we going to let terrorists in with 

991
00:45:06,451 --> 00:45:07,284
refugees in that?
But there's also a home grown grown 

992
00:45:09,391 --> 00:45:11,160
problem right now that we're not dealing
with.

993
00:45:11,850 --> 00:45:12,683
Yeah.

994
00:45:13,300 --> 00:45:14,890
This is my,
and just my opinion,

995
00:45:14,891 --> 00:45:16,540
and again,
I'm not a scholar on this,

996
00:45:17,320 --> 00:45:18,153
but I feel like there are many young 
people in different parts of Europe 

997
00:45:21,911 --> 00:45:22,744
especially,
and I think you were particularly that 

998
00:45:24,431 --> 00:45:25,264
feel that they are.
And a lot of people say they're between 

999
00:45:26,771 --> 00:45:27,604
two cultures.
That's the phrase that people use at 

1000
00:45:28,931 --> 00:45:31,210
there between this western culture and 
their culture back home.

1001
00:45:31,600 --> 00:45:32,433
But I don't think that that's the truth.
I think that the truth is that they 

1002
00:45:35,441 --> 00:45:36,274
don't really have any.
They don't really have any viable 

1003
00:45:38,951 --> 00:45:39,784
options.
They don't really believe in the same 

1004
00:45:41,801 --> 00:45:45,040
stuff that their parents might have done
from Pakistan or whatever and they don't

1005
00:45:45,041 --> 00:45:45,874
really fit in with the community in the 
west and they sort of feel lost by this 

1006
00:45:50,171 --> 00:45:52,180
multiculturalists narrative.
Right?

1007
00:45:52,430 --> 00:45:57,430
That if we can push a and then in a lot 
of people do have a specific critique,

1008
00:45:57,641 --> 00:46:01,210
they say that we have lost our bearings,
we have lost our values,

1009
00:46:01,211 --> 00:46:04,230
we don't really push our story and our 
values and our,

1010
00:46:04,231 --> 00:46:06,850
you know,
and on our way of looking at the world.

1011
00:46:06,850 --> 00:46:11,200
We don't really advocate for that in the
way that it deserves to be advocated for

1012
00:46:11,350 --> 00:46:13,420
and I think these are the people that 
are there,

1013
00:46:13,421 --> 00:46:14,254
the lost children of.
Because these are people who don't have 

1014
00:46:16,361 --> 00:46:18,730
anything so they don't have anything to 
latch onto.

1015
00:46:18,731 --> 00:46:21,570
What they do have to latch onto is it 
somebody comes and says this,

1016
00:46:21,571 --> 00:46:24,700
Islam is narrow and everything makes so 
much sense and it's.

1017
00:46:24,701 --> 00:46:27,310
Everything is so clear now and they can 
grapple onto it.

1018
00:46:27,550 --> 00:46:29,470
I think you've covered this so many 
times.

1019
00:46:29,480 --> 00:46:32,260
You've talked about this,
about freedom of speech issues,

1020
00:46:32,410 --> 00:46:34,390
about how we're not allowed to talk 
about certain ideas.

1021
00:46:34,540 --> 00:46:35,373
I think it's so harmful that we're not 
allowed to talk about critique of 

1022
00:46:37,421 --> 00:46:39,160
religion,
critique of Islam,

1023
00:46:39,310 --> 00:46:42,510
because we're then we're giving up this 
ground to,

1024
00:46:42,590 --> 00:46:45,520
to the Islamists were letting them give 
these people,

1025
00:46:45,521 --> 00:46:46,354
these are the,
these great narratives that they'll 

1026
00:46:48,101 --> 00:46:51,940
latch onto and they don't have any 
opposing narrative at all.

1027
00:46:52,090 --> 00:46:52,740
Yeah.
So,

1028
00:46:52,740 --> 00:46:54,100
so what do we do?
I mean,

1029
00:46:54,101 --> 00:46:54,934
really what are the secular is do I know
that there are some organizations like 

1030
00:46:57,461 --> 00:47:01,360
the one that module is involved in that 
are trying to deradicalize people,

1031
00:47:01,361 --> 00:47:03,880
show them that there's other out and,
and I'm with you.

1032
00:47:03,881 --> 00:47:04,770
I get it,
that it's,

1033
00:47:04,771 --> 00:47:08,920
it's a compounding of economic issues 
and,

1034
00:47:08,950 --> 00:47:13,360
and religious narrative and imperial.
It's all of these things.

1035
00:47:13,510 --> 00:47:14,343
Um,
but how do we move forward because the 

1036
00:47:16,091 --> 00:47:18,040
talking as we're doing,
it's good for now,

1037
00:47:18,220 --> 00:47:21,280
but at some point we got to get to 
these,

1038
00:47:21,910 --> 00:47:24,310
to the kids.
I guess they're the younger generation.

1039
00:47:25,100 --> 00:47:26,730
Well,
this is something I,

1040
00:47:26,731 --> 00:47:29,530
you could get is related to the Syrian 
refugees are coming in,

1041
00:47:29,531 --> 00:47:32,560
a lot of people are very worried about 
the effect that these refugees will have

1042
00:47:32,830 --> 00:47:33,663
on the countries and I think the only 
longterm way of proceeding and making 

1043
00:47:37,841 --> 00:47:38,674
sure that we don't have these same kinds
of problems is to push emergent as much 

1044
00:47:43,061 --> 00:47:43,894
as we can,
which means that we don't allow them to 

1045
00:47:45,400 --> 00:47:49,440
build these isolated little communities.
We spread them out within a,

1046
00:47:49,510 --> 00:47:53,980
within the country and we pull them in 
into the American way of life or Western

1047
00:47:53,981 --> 00:47:54,910
way of life.
What have you.

1048
00:47:55,240 --> 00:47:56,680
Um,
in that sense,

1049
00:47:56,681 --> 00:47:59,410
I think a lot of these multicultural 
narratives are very,

1050
00:47:59,411 --> 00:48:00,250
very,
very harmful.

1051
00:48:00,251 --> 00:48:02,110
I think we need to discard them 
immediately.

1052
00:48:02,320 --> 00:48:03,490
There's a lot of this.
Uh,

1053
00:48:03,740 --> 00:48:05,710
there was a lot of hesitancy.
We know,

1054
00:48:05,800 --> 00:48:09,510
we know how to pull immigrants in and 
how to immerse them into our,

1055
00:48:09,600 --> 00:48:11,500
our study.
We know that there is so much.

1056
00:48:11,600 --> 00:48:15,130
There was so much work about this and 
scholarly stuff about this written about

1057
00:48:15,131 --> 00:48:16,360
this.
We can do it.

1058
00:48:16,690 --> 00:48:18,880
We're a nation of immigrants.
They want it to right.

1059
00:48:19,230 --> 00:48:21,840
Every one of us,
every one of us here in America,

1060
00:48:22,110 --> 00:48:22,943
we either are from immigrants or we were
brought over as slaves or were native 

1061
00:48:27,421 --> 00:48:28,254
Americans,
but the large majority of us are 

1062
00:48:30,931 --> 00:48:31,764
immigrants.

1063
00:48:31,880 --> 00:48:32,261
Right.
And,

1064
00:48:32,261 --> 00:48:34,700
and you know what?
Because what happened was America pulled

1065
00:48:34,701 --> 00:48:36,740
us in and said,
well here's the stuff I don't like,

1066
00:48:36,830 --> 00:48:37,663
but here's the stuff I do like.
And they pulled it together and we 

1067
00:48:39,441 --> 00:48:43,280
became this nation that is so powerful.
And then what you have instead in places

1068
00:48:43,281 --> 00:48:44,114
like the UK,
is it these many nations that are not a 

1069
00:48:46,170 --> 00:48:48,140
part of the overall,
you know,

1070
00:48:48,150 --> 00:48:49,340
Britain,
British society,

1071
00:48:49,341 --> 00:48:50,174
there's little Pakistani community and a
little north African Community and they 

1072
00:48:53,361 --> 00:48:54,194
sort of live as if there were back in 
Pakistan or Bangladesh or whatever it 

1073
00:48:57,381 --> 00:48:58,214
is.
And that I think is so harmful because 

1074
00:48:59,871 --> 00:49:02,650
these people never feel like everyone 
else.

1075
00:49:02,710 --> 00:49:06,800
I feel like an American and I don't 
think everyone else does and I want them

1076
00:49:06,801 --> 00:49:08,750
to feel that way.
I want them to feel like an American.

1077
00:49:08,870 --> 00:49:10,010
Yeah.
It's an interesting.

1078
00:49:10,011 --> 00:49:12,950
It's almost like a self fulfilling 
prophecy because then when,

1079
00:49:13,220 --> 00:49:17,090
when the British people go in and try 
and go move into that community,

1080
00:49:17,330 --> 00:49:20,330
then they feel like those people in that
community feel like they're under attack

1081
00:49:20,331 --> 00:49:23,390
or something or they have to defend 
their little area.

1082
00:49:23,540 --> 00:49:27,080
So you have this constant battle of,
you know,

1083
00:49:27,390 --> 00:49:30,320
uh,
of the self versus the bigger community.

1084
00:49:30,770 --> 00:49:31,151
Yeah.
And what,

1085
00:49:31,151 --> 00:49:33,410
what has happened is that we've given up
the battle,

1086
00:49:33,411 --> 00:49:34,161
right?
We've just said,

1087
00:49:34,161 --> 00:49:34,994
okay,
we'll just live however you want to 

1088
00:49:35,511 --> 00:49:36,344
live.
You're just different people and you 

1089
00:49:37,131 --> 00:49:37,964
just operate on different rules and you 
have different concepts of human rights 

1090
00:49:40,431 --> 00:49:42,050
and that's just,
we're just going to turn a blind eye.

1091
00:49:42,220 --> 00:49:43,700
That's what's happened in the UK I 
think.

1092
00:49:43,701 --> 00:49:43,910
Yeah.

1093
00:49:43,910 --> 00:49:45,230
And we can't do it anymore,
right?

1094
00:49:45,490 --> 00:49:46,630
No,
we have to have these.

1095
00:49:46,810 --> 00:49:47,643
I mean we've always had with these 
immigrant communities in the United 

1096
00:49:49,300 --> 00:49:50,470
States,
these negotiations,

1097
00:49:50,471 --> 00:49:51,304
these back and forths with these 
scuffles and sometimes I've been very 

1098
00:49:53,711 --> 00:49:54,544
painful,
but in the end we're stronger and the 

1099
00:49:55,811 --> 00:49:58,150
immigrant community gets immersed and 
it's stronger too.

1100
00:49:58,540 --> 00:49:59,180
Yeah.
Alright.

1101
00:49:59,180 --> 00:50:00,013
So my final thought would be A.
I've been trying to end all my 

1102
00:50:03,350 --> 00:50:06,140
conversations on,
on a note of positiveness,

1103
00:50:06,350 --> 00:50:07,183
uh,
and I think you've actually given a lot 

1104
00:50:08,181 --> 00:50:09,014
of hope throughout here,
but I definitely sense that the tide is 

1105
00:50:13,011 --> 00:50:13,844
turning.
I know it feels like a dangerous time 

1106
00:50:15,051 --> 00:50:15,884
right now.
There's so much craziness going on and 

1107
00:50:18,471 --> 00:50:20,390
with the Internet,
everything feels smaller.

1108
00:50:20,570 --> 00:50:22,520
So when something happens 5,000
miles away,

1109
00:50:22,521 --> 00:50:24,110
it seems like it happened in your 
backyard.

1110
00:50:24,380 --> 00:50:26,720
But I do send something good here.
The fact that we've,

1111
00:50:27,530 --> 00:50:28,363
the fact that all of these people,
now that we're all in the same circles 

1112
00:50:31,221 --> 00:50:34,310
and we're all talking and our circles 
are getting bigger,

1113
00:50:34,520 --> 00:50:35,353
uh,
I do feel like maybe the tide will turn 

1114
00:50:36,981 --> 00:50:38,150
in our favor.
Do you,

1115
00:50:38,180 --> 00:50:40,940
do you feel that.
Give me something good to end down here.

1116
00:50:41,350 --> 00:50:43,800
I think you're absolutely right.
You've mentioned this before.

1117
00:50:43,801 --> 00:50:46,690
I noticed that things are changing and I
feel this and I think marginalized.

1118
00:50:46,691 --> 00:50:50,370
I've said it to before where you said 
the left is changing and he feels this.

1119
00:50:50,490 --> 00:50:54,060
You can sort of be it in the air,
that there is discontent there,

1120
00:50:54,061 --> 00:50:54,894
that there's people were suddenly.
There's a lot of dissonance going on 

1121
00:50:57,020 --> 00:51:01,350
people's minds and we want it to make 
sense and I think that we're giving,

1122
00:51:01,351 --> 00:51:02,184
you know,
this point of view that we're giving is 

1123
00:51:03,421 --> 00:51:07,560
one that is so much more clear and it's 
so much better for people and better for

1124
00:51:07,561 --> 00:51:11,550
humanity and I think people will,
will slowly gravitate towards it.

1125
00:51:11,750 --> 00:51:12,201
Yeah.
You know,

1126
00:51:12,201 --> 00:51:13,034
it's funny,
I did a video on free speech last week 

1127
00:51:14,361 --> 00:51:15,740
at night,
at the end I referenced,

1128
00:51:16,130 --> 00:51:18,320
you know,
all of this stuff we say safe spaces and

1129
00:51:18,321 --> 00:51:19,154
trigger warnings and all of this 
nonsense and it's like when I speak to 

1130
00:51:22,191 --> 00:51:24,910
someone like you and I speak to them an 
and ion and Sam at all,

1131
00:51:24,940 --> 00:51:26,210
you'd be,
like I said in the video,

1132
00:51:26,211 --> 00:51:27,080
I was like,
look guys,

1133
00:51:27,350 --> 00:51:30,740
watch my videos with these people.
If you think these are the extremists,

1134
00:51:31,160 --> 00:51:34,100
then there's something wrong with you.
It's not something wrong with them.

1135
00:51:34,101 --> 00:51:34,934
You know,
my June Sam just wrote a book called 

1136
00:51:36,050 --> 00:51:36,883
Islam in the future of tolerance.
It wasn't called Islam and the future 

1137
00:51:39,591 --> 00:51:40,424
of,
you know,

1138
00:51:40,460 --> 00:51:42,200
weapons of mass destruction,
you know?

1139
00:51:42,570 --> 00:51:43,820
Uh,
anyway.

1140
00:51:43,821 --> 00:51:45,260
Well,
it's an absolute pleasure.

1141
00:51:45,261 --> 00:51:46,094
I'm so glad we connected and we're able 
to do this and you're doing such great 

1142
00:51:48,981 --> 00:51:50,510
work.
Thank you so much.

1143
00:51:50,511 --> 00:51:51,600
Thank you so much for having me.
Yeah,

1144
00:51:51,640 --> 00:51:52,473
so it's at Sarah the hater on twitter 
and everyone should check out your 

1145
00:51:56,420 --> 00:51:58,820
group,
which is ex Muslims of North America and

1146
00:51:58,821 --> 00:52:02,180
we're going to stay in the loop and the 
next time you know La Dinner's on me.

1147
00:52:03,020 --> 00:52:03,920
Alright.
Alright.

1148
00:52:03,921 --> 00:52:04,754
Thanks a lot Tara.
