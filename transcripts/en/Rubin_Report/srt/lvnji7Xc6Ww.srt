1
00:00:01,710 --> 00:00:03,360
All right,
the big day is here.

2
00:00:03,361 --> 00:00:06,060
We're finally doing the Rubin report fan
show.

3
00:00:06,061 --> 00:00:07,770
In case you missed it a couple of weeks 
back,

4
00:00:07,771 --> 00:00:12,060
I had asked you guys to let me know why 
I should interview you and I got to tell

5
00:00:12,061 --> 00:00:14,190
you guys,
you did not disappoint me.

6
00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:15,083
We got almost 1200 responses within a 
week and ended up selecting 20 of you 

7
00:00:20,610 --> 00:00:23,400
instead of the original five that we had
intended.

8
00:00:23,700 --> 00:00:26,370
We're gonna release these over the 
course of a couple of weeks,

9
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:29,610
each video with a few eight to 10 minute
interviews.

10
00:00:29,970 --> 00:00:30,803
Many of you guys wrote incredible essays
on what's going on in your life and in 

11
00:00:34,261 --> 00:00:35,094
your corner of the world.
I promise you that we read every single 

12
00:00:37,891 --> 00:00:38,724
entry.
It took us a long time and it was 

13
00:00:39,961 --> 00:00:43,140
incredibly difficult to make the 
decision of who to choose.

14
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:47,280
We did our best to pick an eclectic mix 
of people from all over the world.

15
00:00:47,970 --> 00:00:50,460
On a personal note,
I just want to say how truly,

16
00:00:50,490 --> 00:00:53,550
truly honored and humbled I am by your 
submissions.

17
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:55,920
The fact that you guys watched this 
show,

18
00:00:55,921 --> 00:00:56,754
share it with friends and family and are
engaging in the battle of ideas 

19
00:00:59,911 --> 00:01:00,744
yourself,
really makes putting myself out there 

20
00:01:03,540 --> 00:01:04,373
worthwhile.
I'm honored really to have such an 

21
00:01:06,691 --> 00:01:07,524
incredible fan base that not only is 
connecting with me but with each other 

22
00:01:11,041 --> 00:01:11,874
as well.
Clearly you guys all recognize that 

23
00:01:13,921 --> 00:01:18,510
we're in this together and that talking 
about the important issues honestly,

24
00:01:18,630 --> 00:01:22,080
is the only way to move forward as part 
of the human race.

25
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:23,153
All right.
Then the first ever Rubin report fan 

26
00:01:24,841 --> 00:01:26,610
show is here.
Let's roll.

27
00:01:26,890 --> 00:01:28,500
All right.
I'm on with Sophie in London.

28
00:01:28,501 --> 00:01:29,460
Sophie,
has it gone?

29
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:32,380
I'm amazing.
Thank you so much for having me tonight,

30
00:01:32,381 --> 00:01:32,920
Dave.

31
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:33,970
Yeah,
my pleasure.

32
00:01:33,971 --> 00:01:34,930
All right,
so,

33
00:01:34,931 --> 00:01:36,460
uh,
I saw on twitter.

34
00:01:36,461 --> 00:01:37,294
You're very excited to talk to me.
I have a whole list of things that you 

35
00:01:39,161 --> 00:01:39,994
had written in originally about,
but I sensed that more than anything 

36
00:01:42,161 --> 00:01:44,440
else you want to talk about feminism as 
am I right?

37
00:01:44,770 --> 00:01:47,290
Yeah.
My favorite topic.

38
00:01:47,291 --> 00:01:49,030
It's delicious.
Delicious.

39
00:01:49,090 --> 00:01:49,880
All right,
well let's,

40
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:54,080
let's dive right in.
What are your feelings about feminism in

41
00:01:54,081 --> 00:01:54,914
2016?

42
00:01:56,100 --> 00:01:56,933
Well,
the problem is feminism to 2016 isn't 

43
00:02:00,210 --> 00:02:03,420
the feminism that once was,
I think,

44
00:02:03,870 --> 00:02:04,703
I think we know from Milo Yiannopoulos 
and Christina Hoff sommers who promoted 

45
00:02:07,681 --> 00:02:08,514
it amazingly well.
This idea that modern feminism has 

46
00:02:12,211 --> 00:02:14,840
become a kin to martin heating has,
it,

47
00:02:14,850 --> 00:02:16,110
has.
Um,

48
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:21,420
and I myself having been brought up in a
family of mostly females with my dad,

49
00:02:21,421 --> 00:02:22,500
of course,
bless his heart.

50
00:02:23,190 --> 00:02:26,280
I know the value of being a strong 
independent woman,

51
00:02:26,281 --> 00:02:30,000
as Cliche as it sounds.
And that doesn't involve safe spaces.

52
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:32,520
That doesn't involve shying away from 
debate.

53
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:33,660
You know,
what it involves,

54
00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:38,660
it involves being equal to a man.
It involves working to be equal.

55
00:02:39,150 --> 00:02:39,983
So you know,
everything about this whole safe space 

56
00:02:42,451 --> 00:02:45,420
concept is extremely dangerous because 
these people,

57
00:02:45,570 --> 00:02:47,040
these people,
these students,

58
00:02:47,060 --> 00:02:52,060
universities like myself,
they will be subject to mollycoddling to

59
00:02:52,711 --> 00:02:54,630
being told they have victims all the 
time.

60
00:02:55,050 --> 00:02:57,120
And I imagine you're being constantly 
told her a victim.

61
00:02:57,330 --> 00:03:00,100
What is that going to change your 
mentality that extremely damaging.

62
00:03:00,250 --> 00:03:03,910
And that is what might've modernists,
feminism is doing to women all the time.

63
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:08,470
And it's depressing because we all meant
to be for gender equality.

64
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:09,333
So why are we telling these women,
why are we telling females everywhere 

65
00:03:11,201 --> 00:03:14,020
that you can't do this,
that this mystical force,

66
00:03:14,021 --> 00:03:16,750
the patriarchy is supposedly oppression 
pressing us.

67
00:03:17,340 --> 00:03:18,173
And now I say this,
obviously a patriarchy is a serious 

68
00:03:20,081 --> 00:03:23,590
issue in countries such as Middle East 
and India for instance,

69
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,210
in the West,
you know,

70
00:03:25,570 --> 00:03:28,040
I can walk out my house without a male 
mind and it's.

71
00:03:28,150 --> 00:03:29,250
And it's fine.
You know,

72
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:31,450
I don't have this,
I don't have this oppression or May.

73
00:03:31,610 --> 00:03:32,443
Yeah.
So you're telling me you're safe when 

74
00:03:33,321 --> 00:03:34,154
you walk out of your house in London,
you can make it to the store without a 

75
00:03:36,831 --> 00:03:38,360
man and you can do that on your own.

76
00:03:38,670 --> 00:03:39,503
You know what I mean?
Sometimes I do get a bit of a panic 

77
00:03:40,621 --> 00:03:41,454
attack coming up because I feel,
I feel like sometimes a wolf football's 

78
00:03:43,170 --> 00:03:45,570
gonna come at me and then I'm going to 
be triggered and then it's just going to

79
00:03:45,571 --> 00:03:48,080
be horrific.
But I,

80
00:03:48,081 --> 00:03:49,030
you know,
I just manage it.

81
00:03:49,031 --> 00:03:50,040
I just manage it,
Dave.

82
00:03:50,550 --> 00:03:51,383
And this.
The sad thing is is that this is 

83
00:03:54,001 --> 00:03:56,700
extremely patronizing to women and you 
know what?

84
00:03:56,701 --> 00:03:59,100
We're for real quality.
Why are we shying away?

85
00:03:59,101 --> 00:04:01,710
This takes is it takes three steps 
backwards.

86
00:04:01,950 --> 00:04:02,783
This is ridiculous.
It is ridiculous and the thing is with 

87
00:04:06,490 --> 00:04:08,790
modern day feminist feminism,
like I said,

88
00:04:08,940 --> 00:04:12,960
it doesn't support men's needs as well.
If we want gender rights,

89
00:04:13,300 --> 00:04:14,133
gender equality,
we have to consider things that they 

90
00:04:15,631 --> 00:04:18,840
aren't addressing now from what I 
previously stated,

91
00:04:18,841 --> 00:04:19,674
the patriarchy.
Now feminist like to consider it an 

92
00:04:21,571 --> 00:04:22,404
oppressive force on females and they 
like to paint it on western females as 

93
00:04:25,411 --> 00:04:26,244
well,
not just those that are generally 

94
00:04:26,971 --> 00:04:27,804
oppressed.

95
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:28,733
No,
I would say the Patriarchy is doing a 

96
00:04:29,941 --> 00:04:33,930
bloody bad job at benefiting the 
oppresses.

97
00:04:34,290 --> 00:04:36,750
If we look at the end endemic of male 
suicides,

98
00:04:36,751 --> 00:04:37,584
for instance,
if we look at the rates of male to 

99
00:04:40,441 --> 00:04:43,140
female ratios are going to university,
especially in the UK.

100
00:04:43,470 --> 00:04:44,303
It's atrocious and I can't help but feel
that these modern day feminist fighting 

101
00:04:49,201 --> 00:04:51,210
battles out already won in the,
in the,

102
00:04:51,211 --> 00:04:52,620
in the West,
you know,

103
00:04:53,110 --> 00:04:56,070
you know what a pet newspaper here in 
the UK,

104
00:04:56,071 --> 00:04:56,904
the Guardian,
I'm sure you are a big fan of these and 

105
00:04:59,270 --> 00:05:00,690
those,
those lovely articles,

106
00:05:01,420 --> 00:05:02,253
a little aggressive for me,
but every now and again there's 

107
00:05:04,301 --> 00:05:05,134
something.
Okay,

108
00:05:05,590 --> 00:05:06,950
exactly.
There's always like a.

109
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:10,920
I'm a fairly good discussion on an.
It's like a diamond in the rough,

110
00:05:10,980 --> 00:05:14,220
but the most part has become sort of 
click bait.

111
00:05:14,730 --> 00:05:16,650
Guess what we're going to appropriate 
today.

112
00:05:16,770 --> 00:05:19,830
What sexist today?
How can I be a victim today?

113
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:22,440
And it's so disempowering.
You know,

114
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:25,110
I want to read articles about women 
making it in the world,

115
00:05:25,111 --> 00:05:25,944
which we do,
which we do because we are equal to men 

116
00:05:27,361 --> 00:05:30,420
and we should be so proud of it.
So why are we shying away from that?

117
00:05:30,421 --> 00:05:33,330
Why are we teaching these students that,
you know,

118
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:36,090
men are horrible creatures,
which is something that I detest because

119
00:05:36,170 --> 00:05:37,003
we are equal and when I say equal,
we are not the same because we all 

120
00:05:41,330 --> 00:05:42,330
biologically different.
And again,

121
00:05:42,331 --> 00:05:43,164
we should be so proud of that.
We should be proud that we fill each 

122
00:05:44,851 --> 00:05:46,500
other's differences.
We compliment each other.

123
00:05:46,501 --> 00:05:47,460
It's a wonderful thing.

124
00:05:47,510 --> 00:05:48,050
Yeah.
All right,

125
00:05:48,050 --> 00:05:50,120
so we got to pause there because you're 
giving me a lot.

126
00:05:50,121 --> 00:05:50,954
I love it.
And you know,

127
00:05:51,070 --> 00:05:53,060
know I'm on board most of these ideas.
And you know what,

128
00:05:53,061 --> 00:05:53,894
I promise you,
I'm going to send this to Christina 

129
00:05:55,131 --> 00:05:57,200
directly so she can,
she can listen.

130
00:05:57,760 --> 00:05:59,820
Oh lovely.
But,

131
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:01,790
uh,
so when you talk about these ideas,

132
00:06:01,791 --> 00:06:04,100
it's very obvious to me.
You're not just telling me this,

133
00:06:04,101 --> 00:06:05,450
this is something you talk about in 
your,

134
00:06:05,451 --> 00:06:06,284
in your life as well.
When you talk about this either at 

135
00:06:08,090 --> 00:06:11,140
university or with your friends.
Um,

136
00:06:11,270 --> 00:06:12,170
are you,
Shawn,

137
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:14,240
have you been fighting with people?
What's going on?

138
00:06:14,710 --> 00:06:19,710
I've been told to check my privilege 
because I'm apparently I'm not oppressed

139
00:06:19,811 --> 00:06:21,920
enough.
I'm not oppressed enough as a woman.

140
00:06:21,921 --> 00:06:22,754
I'm,
you know,

141
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:23,793
and apparently there are other women out
there in the West that has suffering 

142
00:06:26,561 --> 00:06:29,530
from the patriarchy.
I am yet to be aware of.

143
00:06:29,540 --> 00:06:30,373
I think they should also talk to the 
young working class x coal miner in 

144
00:06:33,521 --> 00:06:38,521
Yorkshire who is currently suffering and
can barely afford a council flat tax,

145
00:06:38,590 --> 00:06:39,423
you know,
so these are just slight discrepancy in 

146
00:06:41,231 --> 00:06:44,110
that little chick and they don't see 
this and I can totally,

147
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:47,710
I can totally empathize with what 
they're trying to do that they're trying

148
00:06:47,711 --> 00:06:49,270
to find some good.
They're trying to do something.

149
00:06:49,271 --> 00:06:50,104
I can see the intentions,
but good intentions don't always mean 

150
00:06:53,441 --> 00:06:54,430
good results,
you know?

151
00:06:55,410 --> 00:06:57,150
Hell is paved with good intentions.

152
00:06:57,590 --> 00:06:59,960
Exactly.
And like you say,

153
00:06:59,961 --> 00:07:03,710
I do get one a shot and I don't want to 
be victimizing myself.

154
00:07:03,940 --> 00:07:06,220
You,
I'm so triggered by talking about it.

155
00:07:06,710 --> 00:07:08,990
That was good to move there.
You could have went that route but I got

156
00:07:09,130 --> 00:07:09,963
out was good.

157
00:07:11,390 --> 00:07:12,223
But in a sense there was a wall.
I will give them videos and say 

158
00:07:14,540 --> 00:07:16,410
Christina's talks or you know,
I'll,

159
00:07:16,411 --> 00:07:19,720
I'll link them.
I don't link them to Milo yet.

160
00:07:20,050 --> 00:07:23,560
I mean I adore him,
but I feel like they won't get him quite

161
00:07:23,561 --> 00:07:24,520
yet.
Baby steps,

162
00:07:24,521 --> 00:07:25,354
you know?
Sure.

163
00:07:25,410 --> 00:07:26,243
I'm all linkedin.
Say Peer reviewed studies suggesting 

164
00:07:28,841 --> 00:07:29,770
perhaps like,
you know,

165
00:07:29,771 --> 00:07:30,604
um,
the pay wage gap has nothing to do with 

166
00:07:31,551 --> 00:07:32,384
the mystical patriarchy but is nearly to
do with job preferences as one of the 

167
00:07:35,471 --> 00:07:38,110
factors.
And they will just dismiss it as saying,

168
00:07:38,111 --> 00:07:40,120
oh,
it's just a one off case,

169
00:07:40,630 --> 00:07:43,870
but how many one off cases can you use 
as an excuse for that?

170
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,310
It's,
it's,

171
00:07:45,311 --> 00:07:46,270
you know,
Straw Manning,

172
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:47,670
so to say the least.
Um,

173
00:07:47,690 --> 00:07:48,523
and they're trying to fight a battle 
which has already been won as many as 

174
00:07:51,311 --> 00:07:52,990
Christina has already said many,
many times.

175
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:54,960
Yeah.
So do you think that goes to the,

176
00:07:54,961 --> 00:07:56,610
you know,
the feelings over facts,

177
00:07:56,611 --> 00:07:59,850
idea that seems to be what comes out of 
unfortunately,

178
00:07:59,851 --> 00:08:01,470
a lot of the left these days.

179
00:08:02,190 --> 00:08:03,023
It is sad and it's sad because as much 
as we used the aggressive black men 

180
00:08:07,110 --> 00:08:08,100
trope,
so to speak.

181
00:08:08,130 --> 00:08:09,870
And it's very true.
It's very true.

182
00:08:09,930 --> 00:08:12,250
I,
I trying not to think that it's most the

183
00:08:12,260 --> 00:08:15,750
left because you know,
I'm very much a liberal and ideas.

184
00:08:15,751 --> 00:08:17,910
I believe I believe in equality.
I believe in gay marriage.

185
00:08:17,911 --> 00:08:20,130
I believe all of that and I believe in 
freedom of expression,

186
00:08:20,131 --> 00:08:23,360
I believe in exchange of ideas and I 
truly believe with freedom,

187
00:08:23,900 --> 00:08:26,160
with free exchange of ideas.
You can,

188
00:08:26,310 --> 00:08:27,780
you can,
you can empathize with people,

189
00:08:27,781 --> 00:08:30,230
you can see why people think the way 
they think and there's,

190
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:32,940
there's this hatred,
there's this tension because you're able

191
00:08:32,941 --> 00:08:33,774
to understand one another,
which is ultimately an amazing thing to 

192
00:08:36,121 --> 00:08:36,954
do in such a globalized world.
And it's hard to do that when you just 

193
00:08:41,550 --> 00:08:44,190
focus solely on emotion,
not logic and rationality,

194
00:08:44,191 --> 00:08:45,840
because then you can misinterpret 
something.

195
00:08:46,020 --> 00:08:47,970
You can say it's racist.
You can say it's bigoted.

196
00:08:47,971 --> 00:08:48,804
When it's perfectly innocent statement.
It's probably a statistic that is 

197
00:08:52,890 --> 00:08:54,660
suddenly magically turned out to be 
racist.

198
00:08:54,910 --> 00:08:56,000
Man,
you are

199
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:00,650
preaching you my logic or something.
I just mangled that one.

200
00:09:00,651 --> 00:09:02,910
I think you could be my new cohost.
Uh,

201
00:09:03,100 --> 00:09:04,820
I want,
I want to shift to one more with you.

202
00:09:05,030 --> 00:09:08,150
Um,
so you mentioned in your submission that

203
00:09:08,151 --> 00:09:12,350
there is a form of atheism,
also a that you don't like.

204
00:09:12,351 --> 00:09:14,110
And now I've had a lot of atheists on 
here.

205
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:14,953
I'm generally,
I'm pro atheist and I'm pro logic and 

206
00:09:17,241 --> 00:09:20,480
reason and all that stuff,
but you think that there is that some of

207
00:09:20,481 --> 00:09:23,240
the movements so to speak has taken a 
turn that you don't like.

208
00:09:23,241 --> 00:09:26,580
Can you tell me about that?
So of course I'm an atheist myself.

209
00:09:26,820 --> 00:09:30,000
Huge fan of the secular movement.
I think we're very,

210
00:09:30,001 --> 00:09:31,340
very fortunate to be living,
you know,

211
00:09:31,630 --> 00:09:32,463
mostly secular world with exceptions and
I'm glad we are doing a lot of work 

212
00:09:35,011 --> 00:09:35,844
towards fixing that.
How about do you think there is a 

213
00:09:37,741 --> 00:09:38,574
sinister smugness and the atheist 
movement and I do think it's connected 

214
00:09:41,011 --> 00:09:43,570
to some,
some of the fallout because um,

215
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:44,673
it's very interesting how some of these 
people swope Sarah religion for their 

216
00:09:47,671 --> 00:09:48,504
own ideology.

217
00:09:49,020 --> 00:09:52,230
Ideology based on the Patriarchy or 
based on imaginary things.

218
00:09:52,231 --> 00:09:55,260
And it's very religion like so in an,
in an,

219
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:57,660
in an essence suddenly swapping 
religion.

220
00:09:57,720 --> 00:09:59,700
And I'm not anti religion.
I might be atheist,

221
00:09:59,701 --> 00:10:00,534
but I'm not anti religion at all.
I think there's a lot to be said for 

222
00:10:02,851 --> 00:10:05,070
some of the cultural things and the 
Anglican Church,

223
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:07,740
the kingdom has given us culture.
It's given us odd.

224
00:10:07,741 --> 00:10:09,870
It's given us an explosion of things we 
can't deny.

225
00:10:09,930 --> 00:10:11,730
Totally.
Exactly.

226
00:10:11,790 --> 00:10:15,510
And so one must be careful when 
criticizing belief,

227
00:10:15,511 --> 00:10:16,344
which is totally fine and not the 
believer and the benefits of what that 

228
00:10:18,901 --> 00:10:20,470
belief has given us.
Um,

229
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:24,670
but I do also think that some of these 
people go get a very Marxist route,

230
00:10:24,671 --> 00:10:25,504
so they do believe that religion is the 
opiate of the people say and they 

231
00:10:28,681 --> 00:10:29,910
completely,
um,

232
00:10:29,940 --> 00:10:32,550
exchange logic and reason for their own 
ideology.

233
00:10:32,730 --> 00:10:33,563
So it's not like they're,
and I'm an atheist because an atheist 

234
00:10:36,241 --> 00:10:38,210
because they've discovered science or 
they've,

235
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:39,540
you know,
read more Dawkins,

236
00:10:39,541 --> 00:10:40,374
they become an atheist sort of as a 
result of the ideology through the 

237
00:10:43,890 --> 00:10:44,723
Cultural Marxism that is being 
perpetuated a lot of the academia 

238
00:10:45,931 --> 00:10:47,820
nowadays.
That's how I'm,

239
00:10:47,850 --> 00:10:49,950
that's why I'm worried about that route.
But for the most part,

240
00:10:49,951 --> 00:10:50,550
you know,
I'm,

241
00:10:50,550 --> 00:10:51,690
I'm,
I'm perfectly,

242
00:10:52,170 --> 00:10:55,500
perfectly joyous park at a secular 
movement.

243
00:10:55,501 --> 00:10:56,970
So that's,
that's fine with me.

244
00:10:57,110 --> 00:10:57,831
Yeah.
All right,

245
00:10:57,831 --> 00:10:59,450
well listen,
this went by super fast.

246
00:10:59,451 --> 00:11:01,820
Clearly we couldn't,
we could have talked a lot more.

247
00:11:01,940 --> 00:11:04,250
I'm curious what,
what do you want to do with your life?

248
00:11:04,430 --> 00:11:08,240
Because obviously you have a lot to say 
and I do get that voice out there

249
00:11:08,750 --> 00:11:10,530
that's very kind of you.
Um,

250
00:11:10,850 --> 00:11:13,070
I have a lot of it.
I want to start my own business.

251
00:11:13,071 --> 00:11:13,904
I'm quite ambitious actually and I'm 
just finishing up my final year 

252
00:11:17,121 --> 00:11:20,810
university so I'll be free from the 
shackles soon enough,

253
00:11:21,170 --> 00:11:22,880
but I'm going to have a think about one 
going to do.

254
00:11:22,881 --> 00:11:25,250
Actually I'm gonna have to think that 
because this is actually,

255
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:26,113
this has been a pleasure actually.
Thank you so much for having me on the 

256
00:11:27,801 --> 00:11:28,350
show.

257
00:11:28,350 --> 00:11:32,640
All right.
I'm on with John from Turkey that John,

258
00:11:32,641 --> 00:11:33,474
it's spelled c a n,
but as I know that the C in Turkey is a 

259
00:11:36,541 --> 00:11:38,010
J.
is that,

260
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:39,660
is that all I need to know about your 
alphabet?

261
00:11:39,661 --> 00:11:41,190
There's a couple of other things I could
probably know,

262
00:11:41,191 --> 00:11:42,024
right?

263
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:43,940
Uh,
pretty much easy.

264
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:47,000
Yeah.
Yeah.

265
00:11:47,430 --> 00:11:49,410
All right.
Well we have a lot to talk about because

266
00:11:49,411 --> 00:11:50,244
we've talked a bit about Turkey on the 
show and you sent us a great email with 

267
00:11:53,170 --> 00:11:54,010
explaining some of your

268
00:11:54,010 --> 00:11:56,260
frustrations with Turkey.
Some of the good things with hurricane.

269
00:11:56,590 --> 00:12:00,250
We're hearing a lot about Turkey in the 
news right now for a series of reasons.

270
00:12:00,510 --> 00:12:01,990
Uh,
so I'm gonna start it there.

271
00:12:01,991 --> 00:12:05,410
Give me just the general state of things
in Turkey right now.

272
00:12:07,140 --> 00:12:09,820
Well,
I'm a little tall,

273
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:10,753
but I can set it up.
Was relatively easy then living in the 

274
00:12:15,321 --> 00:12:19,730
region,
but there are still tons on human rights

275
00:12:19,731 --> 00:12:21,360
violation,
pressure on free,

276
00:12:21,460 --> 00:12:22,293
stress free and we also have a massive 
refugee crisis and is create sacred 

277
00:12:29,740 --> 00:12:32,300
problems,
economical and social problems.

278
00:12:32,690 --> 00:12:36,880
And also we have a really polarized 
country like the,

279
00:12:36,930 --> 00:12:37,763
there are many different social and 
cultural groups that have different 

280
00:12:41,091 --> 00:12:44,040
lifestyles and values and expectations 
from the line.

281
00:12:44,470 --> 00:12:45,303
And finally we have within our sites,
we have a internal conflict for done a 

282
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:51,873
lot on how to use the cards and terms 
and it blurs the line between the 

283
00:12:56,390 --> 00:12:59,520
Islamic center,
the center line lies,

284
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:02,810
and some second Turks stand together 
against the careless.

285
00:13:02,910 --> 00:13:03,890
So I,
I assume you.

286
00:13:03,930 --> 00:13:05,970
Are you totally secular or are you an 
atheist?

287
00:13:05,971 --> 00:13:07,950
Are you religious?
Are you Muslim?

288
00:13:08,010 --> 00:13:09,510
Some combination thereof.

289
00:13:10,590 --> 00:13:12,560
No,
I made this and I'm,

290
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:16,400
I'm,
I'm totally values.

291
00:13:17,020 --> 00:13:18,240
Yeah,
that's it.

292
00:13:18,980 --> 00:13:19,813
Can you be openly atheist,
openly secular there because it sounds 

293
00:13:22,761 --> 00:13:23,594
like the prime minister has sort of been
cracking down on or he's making the 

294
00:13:27,021 --> 00:13:29,330
country more Islamist in a sense.

295
00:13:30,510 --> 00:13:34,640
Why did he tried his best and he has a 
great support.

296
00:13:34,830 --> 00:13:39,830
His name bidding every single election 
that he was getting into,

297
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:46,400
he had been getting into for 14 years.
He has half the every time.

298
00:13:47,510 --> 00:13:51,690
And also we had another becomes a 
nationalist party and upon on like,

299
00:13:52,130 --> 00:13:53,970
well,
uh,

300
00:13:53,980 --> 00:13:56,670
you know,
say that we have roughly been pulled off

301
00:13:56,671 --> 00:13:57,504
the population that are sexually and so 
secular values that have second 

302
00:14:00,870 --> 00:14:05,870
lifestyles sad that Turkey is 99 percent
nine Muslim and that kind of stuff.

303
00:14:09,861 --> 00:14:13,120
But I think it's less than this and it's
a monster.

304
00:14:13,810 --> 00:14:14,643
A atheist community is getting bigger 
and bigger and bigger every day and 

305
00:14:17,371 --> 00:14:22,371
people are understanding that secular 
values are really important for us.

306
00:14:23,300 --> 00:14:25,340
Yeah.
So that's really interesting because,

307
00:14:25,341 --> 00:14:26,174
you know,
we hear from people in the West all the 

308
00:14:27,051 --> 00:14:29,660
time,
they always use Turkey as the example of

309
00:14:29,661 --> 00:14:31,070
sort of like,
you know,

310
00:14:31,071 --> 00:14:33,250
a good Muslim country,
you know,

311
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:35,480
because you're okay,
you can do this,

312
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:37,910
you have no fear about being on this 
show,

313
00:14:37,911 --> 00:14:39,140
right?
You can do this and you're not.

314
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:42,320
I mean I know that Irwin is cracking 
down on the press,

315
00:14:42,321 --> 00:14:42,711
but.
Oh,

316
00:14:42,711 --> 00:14:43,544
do you?

317
00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:44,821
Yeah,
I do.

318
00:14:44,821 --> 00:14:49,320
I can't find it if it's a okay to say 
it,

319
00:14:49,321 --> 00:14:50,154
but I don't know,
like sometimes I feel like if I need 

320
00:14:52,460 --> 00:14:56,010
some certain stuff I,
my job a success,

321
00:14:56,050 --> 00:14:59,780
some stupid things can go badly and that
kind of stuff.

322
00:14:59,781 --> 00:15:00,614
So,
uh,

323
00:15:00,870 --> 00:15:04,080
once it entered the same time I want to,
I want to speak out,

324
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:04,953
I want to be open and I went on to share
my ideas and values and I will not 

325
00:15:08,260 --> 00:15:12,250
Stanford.
And this family's for my country and for

326
00:15:12,260 --> 00:15:13,910
the entire university and especially.

327
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:15,690
Well,
I love that.

328
00:15:15,700 --> 00:15:16,533
That's exactly why I do the show.
So let's talk a little bit about the 

329
00:15:18,371 --> 00:15:22,120
immigration situation because obviously 
you guys,

330
00:15:22,180 --> 00:15:23,013
you share a border with Syria,
it sounds like at some level a lot of 

331
00:15:26,801 --> 00:15:30,220
the European fighters for Isis come 
through Turkey to get there.

332
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:33,260
Then you guys get the refugees.
Then as you said you,

333
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:36,790
there's also this issue with the Kurds 
who are sort of caught in the middle and

334
00:15:36,820 --> 00:15:40,030
being fought on by,
by both Isis and Turkey.

335
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:44,020
So what's the general situation as far 
as like integrating the immigrants?

336
00:15:44,110 --> 00:15:44,943
Are they staying in Turkey?
Are they just using Turkey to go to the 

337
00:15:47,741 --> 00:15:49,240
rest of the Europe?
What's going on?

338
00:15:50,110 --> 00:15:50,943
Well,
no integration because millions of 

339
00:15:57,110 --> 00:16:01,570
people keep coming to Turkey and you 
cannot shut down to boulder.

340
00:16:01,670 --> 00:16:05,210
You cannot just say that you are not 
welcoming you.

341
00:16:05,540 --> 00:16:06,373
So we have to accept that.
But then coming by millions and like 

342
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:16,360
data was three and there's a lot of ice 
I started seeing in different cities and

343
00:16:18,231 --> 00:16:22,430
are totally like beggars on the streets,
like people living almost three years in

344
00:16:22,431 --> 00:16:25,220
refugee camps.
And also,

345
00:16:25,340 --> 00:16:27,690
uh,
I'm going to say that like people say to

346
00:16:27,691 --> 00:16:29,390
you about Turkey is a really big 
company.

347
00:16:30,140 --> 00:16:30,973
For example,
Syria border is roughly thousand 

348
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:36,920
kilometer make from me.
So,

349
00:16:37,250 --> 00:16:39,470
uh,
I don't see that.

350
00:16:39,471 --> 00:16:43,870
I don't feel that effect of ics.
And then kind of Baobab.

351
00:16:44,220 --> 00:16:48,800
Sydney is in the,
on the border suffer the most.

352
00:16:51,250 --> 00:16:52,083
Yeah.

353
00:16:52,210 --> 00:16:53,043
Yeah.
So you also wanted to talk about the 

354
00:16:54,191 --> 00:16:56,110
regressive left.
Of course.

355
00:16:56,111 --> 00:16:57,970
I'd say out of our,
out of our 1200,

356
00:16:58,360 --> 00:16:59,193
out of our 1200 emails,
I'd say about a thousand of them did 

357
00:17:01,180 --> 00:17:02,013
have the phrase a regressive left.
So how has this regressive ideology 

358
00:17:06,550 --> 00:17:08,440
affected your life in Turkey?

359
00:17:10,980 --> 00:17:15,980
Talking on a TV show?
Like A,

360
00:17:19,990 --> 00:17:22,620
I keep getting angry and angry because 
they,

361
00:17:22,630 --> 00:17:27,550
I'm telling blind telling countries,
for example,

362
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:28,433
that a hominid meant.
They say Turkey is a harmony between 

363
00:17:34,930 --> 00:17:39,140
palm tree.
I mean whenever someone criticized Islam

364
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:43,540
they say it's the perfect example and 
you say all Muslims,

365
00:17:43,541 --> 00:17:47,050
but here is 39 to align.
So you're a bigot,

366
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:47,953
you're understandable.
But the reality is much different than 

367
00:17:51,391 --> 00:17:52,224
that.
I mean there is a struggle between the 

368
00:17:53,380 --> 00:17:56,000
centers and the Islamists.
And it's not just like,

369
00:17:56,180 --> 00:18:01,140
and whenever you see like something 
about it on the media,

370
00:18:01,570 --> 00:18:05,670
it's presented like he's holding those 
asshole stitches,

371
00:18:06,060 --> 00:18:09,010
like there's a data and he's doing 
whatever.

372
00:18:09,630 --> 00:18:10,463
He has a shooting hold from society.
I mean 50 percent of people supposedly 

373
00:18:16,710 --> 00:18:19,650
lost lumping.
They just support and love him.

374
00:18:19,651 --> 00:18:20,484
So at the same time we have second that.
So it's just a constant battle between 

375
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,880
us.
So it's not just a,

376
00:18:26,910 --> 00:18:29,880
a,
a harmonious coexistence.

377
00:18:30,210 --> 00:18:33,240
Yeah.
This keeps telling lies about it.

378
00:18:33,330 --> 00:18:35,580
And you know,
I want to say something wrong.

379
00:18:36,150 --> 00:18:36,983
For example,
I always see someone speaking with 

380
00:18:39,390 --> 00:18:44,020
confidence around to villages and that 
kind of stuff.

381
00:18:44,380 --> 00:18:45,213
But then I see people from the left in 
the western countries want cherishing 

382
00:18:48,961 --> 00:18:52,740
the western values in malls and they 
stopped talking,

383
00:18:53,580 --> 00:18:54,413
reading,
getting capable of defending university 

384
00:18:55,841 --> 00:18:58,050
to be random.
So I can't get it.

385
00:18:58,080 --> 00:18:58,913
What's wrong with you?
What's wrong with these liberals in the 

386
00:19:01,771 --> 00:19:02,604
West?

387
00:19:03,340 --> 00:19:04,173
I wish I knew what was wrong with them 
because it would solve a lot of my 

388
00:19:06,191 --> 00:19:09,250
personal problems.
I mean,

389
00:19:09,340 --> 00:19:10,400
I don't know.
So.

390
00:19:10,780 --> 00:19:12,970
But how big is that ideology?
They're like,

391
00:19:12,971 --> 00:19:14,740
so you have,
you have the Islamists,

392
00:19:14,741 --> 00:19:15,131
they,
okay,

393
00:19:15,131 --> 00:19:18,030
we get what they're about.
And then you have the secularists.

394
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:18,993
How big is that,
that piece that is this sort of 

395
00:19:21,701 --> 00:19:22,600
regressive thing

396
00:19:22,700 --> 00:19:23,533
you mean?

397
00:19:24,050 --> 00:19:26,000
Well,
how big is the regressive part?

398
00:19:26,001 --> 00:19:26,834
That's sort of trying to quiet the 
secularist because we know that the 

399
00:19:29,061 --> 00:19:30,860
Islam Mr.
trying to quiet the secularist,

400
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:31,280
right?

401
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:32,090
Well,
you know,

402
00:19:32,090 --> 00:19:34,730
uh,
we don't have the,

403
00:19:34,810 --> 00:19:37,290
we don't have enough conflict to be 
regressing,

404
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:39,670
right?
We don't have any real aggressive in our

405
00:19:39,710 --> 00:19:40,543
country,
but regressives cheap helping to Islam 

406
00:19:44,030 --> 00:19:47,470
in the West and uh,
to do not,

407
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:53,330
I mean are guns in Bangladesh,
Benin in Saudi Arabia,

408
00:19:55,100 --> 00:20:00,100
a mentalist and countries.
They are getting to that by machetes and

409
00:20:01,610 --> 00:20:03,640
people keep talking about,
I mean,

410
00:20:04,070 --> 00:20:06,850
over wearing a book,
is it arrived or,

411
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:09,650
or what does that or people keep talking
about.

412
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:12,190
But Mr and that kind of stuff.
I mean,

413
00:20:12,590 --> 00:20:17,590
this really makes me angry because 
people are fighting for freedom here and

414
00:20:18,110 --> 00:20:19,430
people,
uh,

415
00:20:19,460 --> 00:20:20,293
like the losing their lives.
And then I see people living in comfort 

416
00:20:23,951 --> 00:20:24,784
and a colon.
People even people like me is I've been 

417
00:20:28,701 --> 00:20:32,720
called by a Westerner,
Islamophobia for bad times,

418
00:20:32,900 --> 00:20:35,220
even though I'm living in Turkey,
I was pulled into.

419
00:20:35,590 --> 00:20:37,030
Right.
Your living in it.

420
00:20:37,031 --> 00:20:37,864
They're living in the,
in the comforts of the West and they're 

421
00:20:39,431 --> 00:20:40,940
calling you in Islam.
But listen man,

422
00:20:40,950 --> 00:20:41,650
we,
we could,

423
00:20:41,650 --> 00:20:44,800
we could go on forever.
We could go on forever here,

424
00:20:44,801 --> 00:20:46,810
but unfortunately we got to keep 
rolling,

425
00:20:46,811 --> 00:20:48,460
but it really,
it was a pleasure talking to you

426
00:20:51,560 --> 00:20:52,393
one.

427
00:20:54,140 --> 00:20:55,400
Thanks for submitting.
All right,

428
00:20:55,401 --> 00:20:56,630
we'll talk again.
Alright,

429
00:20:56,750 --> 00:20:59,460
I'm on with Bashir in Jordan.
Bashir.

430
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:00,313
Has It gone?

431
00:21:01,150 --> 00:21:02,410
Doing well.
Thank you.

432
00:21:02,440 --> 00:21:03,490
Thank you for having me.

433
00:21:04,840 --> 00:21:06,760
My pleasure.
I'm doing great.

434
00:21:06,820 --> 00:21:07,391
Uh,
all right.

435
00:21:07,391 --> 00:21:08,680
So you're the third one up.
We're,

436
00:21:08,740 --> 00:21:11,530
we're dancing across the globe here.
You know Jordan,

437
00:21:11,710 --> 00:21:12,543
one of the things when I saw your email,
you're actually the only person from 

438
00:21:15,281 --> 00:21:19,450
Jordan that emailed and we never really 
hear anything about Jordan.

439
00:21:19,451 --> 00:21:21,220
You hear about the Middle East 
constantly,

440
00:21:21,221 --> 00:21:22,054
everyday in the news.
Something terrible is happening in the 

441
00:21:24,340 --> 00:21:25,420
Middle East.
But Jordan,

442
00:21:25,450 --> 00:21:26,283
you don't hear much.
The king comes here and he has a nice 

443
00:21:28,181 --> 00:21:29,014
suit and looks good and everything.
That's pretty much all you hear about 

444
00:21:31,931 --> 00:21:33,340
Jordan.
So tell me a little bit what,

445
00:21:33,341 --> 00:21:34,360
what's going on in Jordan?

446
00:21:34,970 --> 00:21:35,721
Well,
yeah.

447
00:21:35,721 --> 00:21:36,820
Um,
I think,

448
00:21:36,821 --> 00:21:37,654
uh,
Jordan's like the eye of the storm and 

449
00:21:40,221 --> 00:21:43,100
when do you have a storm?
Nobody speaks about the eye of the storm

450
00:21:43,101 --> 00:21:43,934
because it doesn't do anything.
So all the damage is happening all 

451
00:21:46,791 --> 00:21:47,624
around us,
but Jordan is pretty safe and nothing 

452
00:21:49,941 --> 00:21:51,540
really happens.
Um,

453
00:21:51,930 --> 00:21:56,930
except we keep taking in refugees from 
all over and the latest numbers.

454
00:21:58,551 --> 00:22:01,850
I've looked at almost a third of 
Jordan's populations,

455
00:22:01,851 --> 00:22:05,000
actually refugees,
including my family.

456
00:22:05,060 --> 00:22:07,240
We came from Palestine,
uh,

457
00:22:07,250 --> 00:22:08,550
after the,
you know,

458
00:22:08,690 --> 00:22:10,150
the first,
uh,

459
00:22:10,550 --> 00:22:13,430
issues with Israel after the Second 
World War.

460
00:22:13,431 --> 00:22:17,000
So yeah,
my family is included in that number.

461
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:19,473
Are you?
Do you have full rights to Palestinians 

462
00:22:21,401 --> 00:22:23,950
and Jordan have full rights?
They can't,

463
00:22:23,951 --> 00:22:26,950
they can't vote in certain things or 
have certain jobs or something.

464
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:31,140
Well that's a tough one.
There's so many regulations.

465
00:22:31,141 --> 00:22:34,470
So my family has been here from the 
start,

466
00:22:34,471 --> 00:22:35,304
so I'm kind of okay.
But Palestinians who have come later do 

467
00:22:39,481 --> 00:22:41,740
have some issues,
especially with the,

468
00:22:41,850 --> 00:22:44,640
like you said,
and the legal system,

469
00:22:44,641 --> 00:22:48,570
they're not fully protected,
so to speak.

470
00:22:48,630 --> 00:22:49,260
Yeah.

471
00:22:49,260 --> 00:22:51,210
How do you feel in terms of,
so you,

472
00:22:51,211 --> 00:22:52,300
you emailed me,
you're,

473
00:22:52,301 --> 00:22:53,134
you're doing this right now,
like just in the general terms of being 

474
00:22:56,221 --> 00:22:57,054
able to speak your mind and not worry 
about government coercion or anything 

475
00:23:00,601 --> 00:23:02,340
like that.
Like do you feel pretty comfortable?

476
00:23:03,390 --> 00:23:04,223
Um,
uh,

477
00:23:04,260 --> 00:23:05,093
I think I do.
I stopped really bothering with it too 

478
00:23:08,141 --> 00:23:09,400
much.
It start,

479
00:23:09,430 --> 00:23:10,263
you know,
it was really difficult to start 

480
00:23:11,321 --> 00:23:12,154
speaking out and eventually you find 
your own circles and at some point 

481
00:23:15,730 --> 00:23:16,563
there's a tipping point where you just 
don't care anymore about the 

482
00:23:19,841 --> 00:23:21,910
consequences.
You're,

483
00:23:21,970 --> 00:23:24,820
you just fight for what you think is 
right.

484
00:23:24,910 --> 00:23:25,743
And this is one of the reasons I love 
your show and I love you and I admire 

485
00:23:29,381 --> 00:23:30,430
you for what you're doing.

486
00:23:30,510 --> 00:23:32,010
Thanks.
Um,

487
00:23:32,140 --> 00:23:34,480
all right.
So you gave me a bunch of great stuff to

488
00:23:34,481 --> 00:23:35,314
talk about here.
One of the things you want it to focus 

489
00:23:36,491 --> 00:23:41,010
on was the western apologists for Islam.
Now obviously,

490
00:23:41,011 --> 00:23:41,844
yeah,
obviously I've spent a lot of time 

491
00:23:43,691 --> 00:23:45,010
talking about it,
right.

492
00:23:45,050 --> 00:23:47,400
And I always try to separate,
you know,

493
00:23:47,430 --> 00:23:49,670
the,
the Muslim people,

494
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,100
uh,
from the doctrine of Islam.

495
00:23:52,101 --> 00:23:54,530
It's very hard to do as we know.
Uh,

496
00:23:54,590 --> 00:23:55,400
but yeah,
go ahead.

497
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:56,233
Do the Western apologist.
You're in a Muslim majority country 

498
00:23:59,420 --> 00:24:03,320
having to live under certain laws 
dictated by Islam.

499
00:24:03,321 --> 00:24:07,280
So what do you make of these people in 
the West that are apologizing for this?

500
00:24:07,420 --> 00:24:10,390
Well,
I'll just start out by saying like,

501
00:24:10,420 --> 00:24:13,450
even your distinction is sometimes a bit
blurry,

502
00:24:13,451 --> 00:24:17,470
like even when you separate Muslim 
peoples and the doctrine of Islam.

503
00:24:18,280 --> 00:24:20,770
I think there's still some muddy areas 
in between.

504
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:21,900
Sure.
I mean,

505
00:24:21,910 --> 00:24:24,400
sure,
all of us want to be nice and peaceful,

506
00:24:24,401 --> 00:24:25,234
but at the same time when you're in a 
conflict and you expect the other site 

507
00:24:29,381 --> 00:24:32,710
to be as nice as you,
that's I think a bit silly.

508
00:24:33,040 --> 00:24:33,873
You don't walk up to a lion with a 
flower expect there'll be friends 

509
00:24:37,331 --> 00:24:38,330
forever.
So yeah,

510
00:24:38,420 --> 00:24:40,150
that doesn't work.
Um,

511
00:24:41,110 --> 00:24:42,900
so,
uh,

512
00:24:43,150 --> 00:24:45,190
the,
the western amount apologists is,

513
00:24:45,191 --> 00:24:46,024
my problem with them is by focusing on 
they miss direct the problems and the 

514
00:24:52,360 --> 00:24:54,750
issues and as if it's like,
no,

515
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:56,340
it's not as bad,
you know,

516
00:24:56,710 --> 00:25:00,430
I'm sure like people like Reza,
Aslan and the young Turks,

517
00:25:00,431 --> 00:25:05,240
sorry from bringing data,
but what they practically do is the,

518
00:25:05,241 --> 00:25:06,074
the,
the effect on the good people like 

519
00:25:08,981 --> 00:25:09,814
yourself and like the classical liberals
or whoever is genuinely caring about 

520
00:25:13,961 --> 00:25:16,780
what's happening in the Middle East and 
the Muslim majority countries,

521
00:25:18,580 --> 00:25:23,580
they take the conversation away and it 
alleviates this sense of urgency.

522
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:27,790
They just kill it.
Like if you want it to help and then you

523
00:25:27,791 --> 00:25:28,624
hear someone who claims to be a scholar 
and like he knows everything on the 

524
00:25:31,721 --> 00:25:36,290
inside and they tell you that no,
it's all fine then.

525
00:25:37,090 --> 00:25:40,090
Yeah,
I don't feel the urge to help anymore.

526
00:25:40,690 --> 00:25:45,690
And for us on the inside,
we see this almost on a daily basis.

527
00:25:46,300 --> 00:25:47,133
I mean female genital mutilation,
homophobia and all the terrible things 

528
00:25:51,671 --> 00:25:55,120
people just genuinely dislike in the 
west.

529
00:25:56,410 --> 00:26:00,130
These are real problems and we would 
appreciate the help from,

530
00:26:00,280 --> 00:26:01,840
you know,
from everybody.

531
00:26:01,900 --> 00:26:03,040
We can help,

532
00:26:03,220 --> 00:26:04,180
right?
So in a way,

533
00:26:04,181 --> 00:26:06,370
so your,
your in like a particularly,

534
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:07,473
uh,
I guess tenuous situation because 

535
00:26:09,101 --> 00:26:10,120
you're,
you're clearly,

536
00:26:10,121 --> 00:26:10,954
you're,
I assume you identify as a classical 

537
00:26:11,981 --> 00:26:12,814
liberal or a liberal or some or 
something you stand for basically 

538
00:26:17,621 --> 00:26:19,390
Western values I sense,
right.

539
00:26:19,560 --> 00:26:20,410
Uh,
and,

540
00:26:20,411 --> 00:26:21,244
and you,
you sort of need the help of the 

541
00:26:22,961 --> 00:26:26,020
outsiders to,
to make change there because it would be

542
00:26:26,021 --> 00:26:27,820
very hard to do on your own.
Right.

543
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:30,080
Well,
you know,

544
00:26:30,081 --> 00:26:32,510
of course to help would be much 
appreciated,

545
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:35,630
but when there is,
what's the opposite of helping,

546
00:26:35,660 --> 00:26:36,493
they're just not helping at all and 
they're actually making everyone else 

547
00:26:40,551 --> 00:26:41,384
feel like there's no problem,
there's no problem then well what are 

548
00:26:45,961 --> 00:26:46,794
you going to do?
The problem is going to keep on 

549
00:26:48,331 --> 00:26:51,810
escalating until it just blows up.
So I don't,

550
00:26:51,811 --> 00:26:52,644
I,
it's,

551
00:26:52,820 --> 00:26:53,653
it's,
it's a tough question I think because I 

552
00:26:55,951 --> 00:26:56,784
mean sure that help would be needed but 
not ruining it for us would be also 

553
00:27:01,510 --> 00:27:02,280
appreciated.

554
00:27:02,280 --> 00:27:04,290
Right.
So on a day to day basis,

555
00:27:04,291 --> 00:27:08,550
living in Jordan,
like how much is religion affecting?

556
00:27:08,580 --> 00:27:09,930
Well,
are you religious at all?

557
00:27:09,931 --> 00:27:12,600
Do you have any religious?
I'm not.

558
00:27:12,680 --> 00:27:13,513
Yeah,
I'm not.

559
00:27:13,560 --> 00:27:17,250
So how much religious religiosity,
religiosity,

560
00:27:17,251 --> 00:27:19,050
what's the word there?
How much of that are you?

561
00:27:19,260 --> 00:27:20,430
Yeah,
I think I got something close.

562
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:21,433
Um,
how much of that is affecting your day 

563
00:27:22,981 --> 00:27:23,814
to day life?

564
00:27:25,300 --> 00:27:26,133
Well,
my day to day life isn't really a 

565
00:27:28,661 --> 00:27:31,140
problem for me,
but uh,

566
00:27:31,390 --> 00:27:36,390
if you look at other segments of society
like women or homosexuals or you know,

567
00:27:37,690 --> 00:27:38,523
any kind of a traditionally marginalized
group because Jordan is still a very 

568
00:27:43,121 --> 00:27:44,920
patriarchal society.
I'm like,

569
00:27:44,921 --> 00:27:46,630
what?
Feminists in the US,

570
00:27:47,370 --> 00:27:48,450
right,
right.

571
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:51,030
Yeah.
So I mean,

572
00:27:51,031 --> 00:27:53,100
being a woman,
if you walk down the street,

573
00:27:53,101 --> 00:27:55,890
you're expected to be dressed 
appropriately,

574
00:27:55,891 --> 00:27:56,724
which is pretty much covered up and it's
not really strict like in Saudi Arabia 

575
00:28:00,181 --> 00:28:02,490
where you have to wear the veil.
It's not like that,

576
00:28:02,820 --> 00:28:05,070
but like don't show legs or,
you know,

577
00:28:06,150 --> 00:28:10,230
so it's kind of moderate in that sense.
Um,

578
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:12,690
the religiosity is pretty much 
everywhere.

579
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:13,553
Like um,
you always see these verses from the 

580
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:18,113
Koran or somewhere in the streets.
You always hear the call to prayer five 

581
00:28:21,781 --> 00:28:23,980
times a day.
Um,

582
00:28:24,510 --> 00:28:27,330
so,
and it's part of our language.

583
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:30,240
We always say like,
you might've heard this phrase,

584
00:28:30,250 --> 00:28:31,410
inshallah,
of course.

585
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:32,633
So yeah,
a lot of the profit always come into 

586
00:28:34,380 --> 00:28:35,213
these traditional phrases.
We don't probably mean it to be 

587
00:28:39,061 --> 00:28:43,300
religious,
but it's just ingrained in us and yeah,

588
00:28:43,340 --> 00:28:48,340
it's just an escapable really.
But I mean it's not as bad as elsewhere,

589
00:28:49,020 --> 00:28:51,480
so that's some hope for us.

590
00:28:51,630 --> 00:28:54,180
Yeah.
Well this was quick weight.

591
00:28:54,181 --> 00:28:57,540
We're basically wearing the same shirt.
I just realized it's pretty close.

592
00:28:57,690 --> 00:28:59,550
Oh,
so we're in good company.

593
00:29:00,380 --> 00:29:01,420
Listen,
I could go way,

594
00:29:01,530 --> 00:29:04,260
way longer with you,
but we got to go your third out of,

595
00:29:04,290 --> 00:29:07,260
out of 20,
but it was a pleasure talking to you and

596
00:29:07,530 --> 00:29:09,900
let's stay in the loop and I hope to get
Jordan one day.

597
00:29:10,900 --> 00:29:13,330
Well you're always welcome.
Great.

598
00:29:13,450 --> 00:29:15,880
Thank you so much.
Don't tell us you're gay though.

599
00:29:17,770 --> 00:29:20,040
We'll keep it quiet.
Keep it quiet door.

600
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:22,980
Alright,
I'm here with Felix in Germany.

601
00:29:22,981 --> 00:29:24,780
Felix,
you dressed for the occasion.

602
00:29:24,781 --> 00:29:26,970
Finally.
Somebody that's looking sharp.

603
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:28,020
That's nice to see.

604
00:29:28,440 --> 00:29:31,230
Thank you.
I mean you always dressed very well,

605
00:29:31,231 --> 00:29:33,360
so I thought I dressed up for location 
as well.

606
00:29:33,930 --> 00:29:35,130
Very nice.
You went up.

607
00:29:35,160 --> 00:29:38,310
Me with the Thai next time maybe I'll 
see what I can do.

608
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:39,313
All right.
So we got a lot of responses from 

609
00:29:40,351 --> 00:29:41,184
Germany,
I'd say after probably the United 

610
00:29:42,820 --> 00:29:42,820
States,

611
00:29:42,820 --> 00:29:44,980
UK,
maybe Canada,

612
00:29:44,981 --> 00:29:45,814
and then India.
I think Germany was right there in the 

613
00:29:47,651 --> 00:29:48,490
top five.
So you're,

614
00:29:48,520 --> 00:29:50,890
you're the one that we selected from 
Germany.

615
00:29:50,980 --> 00:29:51,813
Uh,
so tell me what's going on in Germany 

616
00:29:53,171 --> 00:29:54,004
these days.

617
00:29:54,600 --> 00:29:55,433
I mean the biggest thing is obviously 
the refugee crisis and the whole 

618
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:00,433
political fear that is surrounding that.
So kind of all it is in trouble because 

619
00:30:07,821 --> 00:30:08,654
we have people who don't agree with 
established politicians and established 

620
00:30:12,261 --> 00:30:15,500
politicians fighting each other.
So it's really interesting times.

621
00:30:15,710 --> 00:30:17,450
Yeah.
So we've talked about it a little bit.

622
00:30:17,451 --> 00:30:21,560
Basically you guys have let in about one
point $3 million,

623
00:30:21,880 --> 00:30:24,350
uh,
immigrants or migrants or refugees,

624
00:30:24,351 --> 00:30:25,184
whatever you want to call them.
You guys give them some pretty great 

625
00:30:27,501 --> 00:30:29,060
social services,
right?

626
00:30:29,061 --> 00:30:31,950
It seems like they get a lot.
So what,

627
00:30:32,010 --> 00:30:33,590
what is the problem?
What is,

628
00:30:33,591 --> 00:30:37,460
is there an integration problem?
Is it more from the German side?

629
00:30:37,461 --> 00:30:39,620
Is it from their side?
Is it both?

630
00:30:39,650 --> 00:30:41,060
Is it economics?
What's going on?

631
00:30:41,950 --> 00:30:42,783
See Dave,
I would say it's not a problem with 

632
00:30:45,710 --> 00:30:50,120
either the Jamon locals on the migrants 
or refugees themselves.

633
00:30:50,121 --> 00:30:50,954
It's a problem or systems.
The government lead in all these 

634
00:30:53,151 --> 00:30:53,984
immigrants who are not necessarily all 
refugees because there's really no 

635
00:30:58,370 --> 00:30:59,203
proper control who gets in and who 
doesn't and they sought out later and a 

636
00:31:03,291 --> 00:31:04,124
process that takes months until the 
whole asylum application goes through 

637
00:31:09,080 --> 00:31:11,540
and then we take and one point 3 million
of them,

638
00:31:12,110 --> 00:31:17,110
but there's no system to give them 
shelter effectively to integrate them,

639
00:31:18,350 --> 00:31:19,183
to teach them about the German culture.
So what we get a lot of people bunched 

640
00:31:23,211 --> 00:31:27,110
up in a really small place who come from
different cultures than our home culture

641
00:31:27,590 --> 00:31:28,423
and then found their own little 
subcultures and don't integrate very 

642
00:31:30,891 --> 00:31:35,300
well because they have nobody to really 
talk to except for the old people.

643
00:31:35,550 --> 00:31:38,760
Yeah.
So does Germany have a sort of a special

644
00:31:38,761 --> 00:31:39,594
place in this?
Because of the history with Germany and 

645
00:31:42,691 --> 00:31:43,524
obviously xenophobia and World War Two 
in Germany has done a tremendous amount 

646
00:31:46,831 --> 00:31:50,400
to to repair that in.
The culture has completely changed.

647
00:31:50,401 --> 00:31:51,234
I think that's very obvious,
but that there's a certain amount of 

648
00:31:53,191 --> 00:31:54,024
guilt that you want to do the right 
thing and then they come here and then 

649
00:31:58,411 --> 00:32:01,230
the systems as you're saying or just not
in place.

650
00:32:01,231 --> 00:32:02,064
So it's like the idea doesn't quite 
match up with the reality of what's 

651
00:32:04,681 --> 00:32:05,514
going on.

652
00:32:06,100 --> 00:32:08,710
That's exactly what's happening in 
Germany.

653
00:32:08,711 --> 00:32:13,711
We have a certain type of unique 
political correctness and that we really

654
00:32:14,141 --> 00:32:19,141
still have the shame or the guilt and 
wanted to redeem ourselves basically,

655
00:32:19,631 --> 00:32:23,920
even though we are homeless,
two generations removed from the events,

656
00:32:23,921 --> 00:32:24,754
but most Germans stove feel the need to 
be proper to other people and to help 

657
00:32:30,160 --> 00:32:30,993
others so that the good will of helping 
these people and naturally people who 

658
00:32:34,900 --> 00:32:37,630
come from civil war,
written areas,

659
00:32:37,960 --> 00:32:40,760
there is a feeling off.
You have to help them out.

660
00:32:41,420 --> 00:32:42,253
But I think the way we are doing it now 
is really failing those people in need 

661
00:32:45,230 --> 00:32:49,760
and have this also failing the people 
locally in Germany.

662
00:32:50,090 --> 00:32:52,550
Yeah.
So let's talk a little bit about,

663
00:32:52,660 --> 00:32:53,493
uh,
what happened on New Year's day in 

664
00:32:54,651 --> 00:32:55,484
Cologne because I thought that was sort 
of a perfect example of why this whole 

665
00:32:58,671 --> 00:33:02,780
debate is so crazy.
So there were these massive attacks that

666
00:33:02,781 --> 00:33:05,900
mostly it sounds like they were mostly 
done by migrants,

667
00:33:06,100 --> 00:33:08,210
uh,
assaulting women that were raped and all

668
00:33:08,211 --> 00:33:09,044
this stuff.
And I saw the reaction of the left here 

669
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:13,070
immediately was saying,
God,

670
00:33:13,071 --> 00:33:15,270
this is Islamophobia and all of this 
stuff that we,

671
00:33:15,310 --> 00:33:19,670
we talk about endlessly.
And really it didn't have anything to do

672
00:33:19,671 --> 00:33:20,510
with that.
If a group,

673
00:33:20,511 --> 00:33:22,850
if any group had attacked a whole bunch 
of women,

674
00:33:23,150 --> 00:33:25,310
uh,
I would have been against that group.

675
00:33:25,670 --> 00:33:28,970
How was the reaction in Germany to that?
Because it sounded like it took a couple

676
00:33:28,971 --> 00:33:30,860
of days for it actually to catch on.
Right?

677
00:33:30,861 --> 00:33:32,480
And then people didn't really want to 
talk about it.

678
00:33:33,500 --> 00:33:34,333
Well,
it almost took a few weeks because the 

679
00:33:37,061 --> 00:33:37,894
fact that those groups who assaulted 
than women were mainly immigrants was 

680
00:33:42,610 --> 00:33:46,840
hidden away from the public essentially 
by a political officials and police.

681
00:33:47,320 --> 00:33:51,610
And the reaction was quite interesting 
because people were really afraid.

682
00:33:51,611 --> 00:33:52,444
And really angry about the situation and
some on the left that the same as 

683
00:33:57,040 --> 00:33:57,873
leftists in America and try to put it 
away from Islam as a religion or 

684
00:34:03,851 --> 00:34:06,070
culture.
And then on the right,

685
00:34:06,160 --> 00:34:10,630
a lot of people blame Islam or Muslims 
in general for that,

686
00:34:10,631 --> 00:34:11,464
which is obviously also way too extreme,
but kind of the center is missing where 

687
00:34:15,261 --> 00:34:16,094
we acknowledged the problem that there 
are cultural differences and if you put 

688
00:34:19,690 --> 00:34:23,610
young males who come from this culture,
I've been growing up in this culture,

689
00:34:23,620 --> 00:34:24,453
put them in a place and just let them 
have their own communities without any 

690
00:34:28,901 --> 00:34:32,100
integration that these problems can 
occur and we'll look you.

691
00:34:32,200 --> 00:34:33,033
And that's where we have no solution for
it because we can't acknowledge the 

692
00:34:36,341 --> 00:34:37,140
problem.

693
00:34:37,140 --> 00:34:39,270
Yeah.
So with everything you've said so far,

694
00:34:39,750 --> 00:34:40,583
do you guys have a particular sort of 
fear of the right wing parties growing 

695
00:34:46,261 --> 00:34:51,261
because because of the history of your 
country that you don't want these,

696
00:34:52,170 --> 00:34:55,920
the Zena phobic people to actually take 
power.

697
00:34:55,921 --> 00:34:58,140
And then at the same time,
as we talked about all the time,

698
00:34:58,141 --> 00:35:00,120
if the left doesn't deal with these 
issues,

699
00:35:00,121 --> 00:35:02,760
honestly,
it almost seems like the average person,

700
00:35:02,761 --> 00:35:04,680
the person that's in the middle that 
you're talking about,

701
00:35:05,030 --> 00:35:07,950
well then they go to where the only 
answer is being spoken of,

702
00:35:07,980 --> 00:35:09,560
even if it's not something they agree 
with.

703
00:35:10,990 --> 00:35:13,390
That's exactly right.
And that's what we've been seeing.

704
00:35:13,391 --> 00:35:14,224
I mean,
that's always a move from the 

705
00:35:16,150 --> 00:35:20,440
established politicians to band,
the few very right wing parties,

706
00:35:21,050 --> 00:35:21,750
um,
that,

707
00:35:21,750 --> 00:35:24,450
that we'd still have in Germany,
which are really extreme,

708
00:35:24,790 --> 00:35:29,230
at least some of them are.
And they always try to bend them via the

709
00:35:29,231 --> 00:35:33,160
legal system.
But now what the channel of for Germany,

710
00:35:33,161 --> 00:35:36,130
the afd in Germany,
that's a new party,

711
00:35:36,140 --> 00:35:36,973
it sprung in.
All this controversy in Dave become 

712
00:35:39,900 --> 00:35:40,733
very,
very big and a lot of people jump onto 

713
00:35:43,291 --> 00:35:45,030
that opportunity.
But at the same time,

714
00:35:45,031 --> 00:35:48,720
a lot of right wing extremist obviously 
jumped on that.

715
00:35:48,870 --> 00:35:53,340
And the established politicians all try 
to pay in this new party,

716
00:35:53,341 --> 00:35:54,174
which is more conservative,
more right wing into the Nazi Kona to 

717
00:35:58,860 --> 00:36:02,910
isolate them.
But then of course said you get a lot of

718
00:36:02,911 --> 00:36:06,480
extremists who join that party and you 
don't find the real discourse.

719
00:36:06,610 --> 00:36:08,590
Yeah.
So one of the things that you wrote that

720
00:36:08,591 --> 00:36:09,700
I thought it was really,
really great.

721
00:36:09,701 --> 00:36:10,534
So first off,
you're starting a podcast with a 

722
00:36:12,611 --> 00:36:14,320
Hungarian friend.
Is He,

723
00:36:14,321 --> 00:36:16,330
is he in Germany or is he in Hungary or 
somewhere else?

724
00:36:16,340 --> 00:36:18,740
So we just in Hungary,
we've impersonal.

725
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:22,720
We've only met once when I was at a time
where you connected through the Internet

726
00:36:23,170 --> 00:36:26,890
just by chance.
I met him one day and we started talking

727
00:36:26,891 --> 00:36:27,724
and talking and talking and because we 
both felt the need to speak out about 

728
00:36:32,711 --> 00:36:34,210
politics,
about philosophy,

729
00:36:34,211 --> 00:36:38,140
about our societies and to discuss how 
we can make them better.

730
00:36:38,460 --> 00:36:40,900
Uh,
we started having night long discussions

731
00:36:40,901 --> 00:36:45,901
literally through the night until the 
sun came back up and at some point we,

732
00:36:47,140 --> 00:36:47,973
through shows like yours where you 
really emphasized the need to make your 

733
00:36:51,881 --> 00:36:52,714
voice heard.
We decided we have to do something and 

734
00:36:55,151 --> 00:36:55,984
we decided to basically start a podcast 
to get other people in to discuss that 

735
00:36:59,890 --> 00:37:00,723
stuff with us and to develop our 
opinions openly and to kind of make a 

736
00:37:05,021 --> 00:37:05,690
difference.

737
00:37:05,690 --> 00:37:06,501
Yeah.
Well listen,

738
00:37:06,501 --> 00:37:07,334
I love that.
And if every single person that watched 

739
00:37:09,051 --> 00:37:11,960
this show started their own show and I 
became completely irrelevant,

740
00:37:11,961 --> 00:37:15,560
but the idea is one I would be,
I'll be happy to retire on a,

741
00:37:15,561 --> 00:37:16,394
on a farm in Wyoming or something.
So one of the phrases that you used in 

742
00:37:19,341 --> 00:37:20,174
your email to us was the difference 
between a global network and a local 

743
00:37:23,721 --> 00:37:24,321
network.
And I,

744
00:37:24,321 --> 00:37:25,154
I thought this concept was really cool 
because it's very much what we're doing 

745
00:37:28,281 --> 00:37:29,114
here and it's why I wanted to do this 
fashion show and we have 20 people I 

746
00:37:31,401 --> 00:37:34,130
think in 18 countries or so,
or 15 countries.

747
00:37:34,430 --> 00:37:35,263
Uh,
so can you describe what you meant by 

748
00:37:35,991 --> 00:37:37,100
that concept?

749
00:37:37,960 --> 00:37:41,260
So a lot of our local networks like 
universities,

750
00:37:41,261 --> 00:37:42,094
schools,
but cities and even countries are very 

751
00:37:45,101 --> 00:37:45,960
isolated.
We,

752
00:37:46,050 --> 00:37:49,990
we have a consensus usually in those 
networks,

753
00:37:50,050 --> 00:37:52,540
in universities,
in America for example,

754
00:37:52,541 --> 00:37:53,374
you have all the social justice warriors
having a real consensus and a lot of 

755
00:37:57,101 --> 00:37:58,430
power,
so you can't,

756
00:37:58,540 --> 00:37:59,373
I think as a modern human,
you can't rely on that to get a full 

757
00:38:03,101 --> 00:38:03,934
picture.
So these global networks that are 

758
00:38:05,321 --> 00:38:08,530
enabled by the Internet,
our really Ed,

759
00:38:08,670 --> 00:38:12,610
where you can get your ideas challenged,
where you can get new ideas,

760
00:38:12,611 --> 00:38:16,030
where you can exchange ideas and that's 
where you develop the good stuff.

761
00:38:16,260 --> 00:38:17,580
Yeah.
Well I love that.

762
00:38:17,581 --> 00:38:18,414
It's very much a concept that I believe 
in and that I'm trying to put into 

763
00:38:20,821 --> 00:38:22,950
action and uh,
we got to go,

764
00:38:22,951 --> 00:38:24,840
but definitely let me know when the 
podcast is up.

765
00:38:24,841 --> 00:38:25,674
Just email us again.
I'll be happy to send people over there 

766
00:38:27,330 --> 00:38:29,220
and I'll be a guest if you want.
How about that?

767
00:38:29,860 --> 00:38:30,880
Oh,
that would be amazing.

768
00:38:30,881 --> 00:38:33,310
It's actually up now.
We're on episode four now.

769
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:34,273
Nice.
And you can that on a needlessly 

770
00:38:36,761 --> 00:38:38,560
complicated.com
on,

771
00:38:38,640 --> 00:38:41,770
on itunes and everything else.
And if you want to be honest,

772
00:38:41,771 --> 00:38:44,950
I'm happy to.
I guess I am happy to send you an email.

773
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:46,350
You'd be the host.
I'll be the guest.

774
00:38:46,351 --> 00:38:48,000
How about that?
Alright,

775
00:38:48,060 --> 00:38:51,750
so I am with Monica in Paris,
France and Monica,

776
00:38:51,751 --> 00:38:54,570
you know,
I got a zillion people that emailed from

777
00:38:54,600 --> 00:38:56,760
Paris,
but your bio,

778
00:38:56,820 --> 00:38:57,653
your bio,
just where you've bounced around from a 

779
00:39:00,121 --> 00:39:00,954
little bit of your family's history.
There was so much there that you were 

780
00:39:04,201 --> 00:39:05,760
the winner from Paris.

781
00:39:06,040 --> 00:39:08,130
Oh cool.
Thanks.

782
00:39:08,590 --> 00:39:10,000
Alright.
So first off just tell me,

783
00:39:10,001 --> 00:39:13,660
so you told me that you grew up with two
atheist parents,

784
00:39:13,900 --> 00:39:14,733
but that,
that was also colored with a Mexican 

785
00:39:16,871 --> 00:39:20,560
tradition and a Jewish tradition.
Can you just explain some of that?

786
00:39:21,160 --> 00:39:21,570
Yes.

787
00:39:21,570 --> 00:39:26,470
So my mom is from Mexico.
She's from a city to the north of Mexico

788
00:39:26,470 --> 00:39:27,303
City and she emigrated to the United 
States as a baby and my dad is of 

789
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:35,470
Russian Ashkenazi descent and they both 
met in university.

790
00:39:35,471 --> 00:39:36,304
They've always been atheist,
both of them and they raised me and my 

791
00:39:38,321 --> 00:39:39,154
sister not to be atheist,
but religion has never played a part of 

792
00:39:42,581 --> 00:39:46,180
our lives and yet we were raised between
the two cultures,

793
00:39:46,181 --> 00:39:49,630
which was quite difficult growing up in 
Arizona and California.

794
00:39:49,960 --> 00:39:51,970
We were never Mexican enough to be 
Mexican,

795
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:56,470
never white enough to be white.
So it was an interesting experience.

796
00:39:56,630 --> 00:39:58,120
Right.
I'm very grateful for it.

797
00:39:58,490 --> 00:39:59,810
Yeah,
that's really cool.

798
00:39:59,811 --> 00:40:02,570
So then you bounced around pretty much 
all over the world.

799
00:40:02,571 --> 00:40:03,404
So can you give me like a one minute 
synopsis of just where you've bounced 

800
00:40:05,631 --> 00:40:08,060
around and then we'll dig into some of 
the things that you want to talk about?

801
00:40:08,550 --> 00:40:09,031
Yeah,
sure.

802
00:40:09,031 --> 00:40:14,031
So I lived in Argentina for about a year
and 2012 after that.

803
00:40:14,821 --> 00:40:15,654
Um,
I lived in Israel for awhile and now I 

804
00:40:18,181 --> 00:40:21,840
live in France,
so I lived in a few different countries.

805
00:40:22,060 --> 00:40:22,893
Okay.
So let's go to some of the reasons that 

806
00:40:25,061 --> 00:40:25,894
you've bounced around.
So you met an Israeli and you move to 

807
00:40:28,991 --> 00:40:33,610
Israel and then you were there during 
the Gaza War of 2014,

808
00:40:33,611 --> 00:40:34,444
I think.
Yeah.

809
00:40:35,230 --> 00:40:36,250
During protective edge,

810
00:40:36,410 --> 00:40:37,243
protective edge.
So tell me a little bit about what it's 

811
00:40:38,751 --> 00:40:42,110
like to be in a country that is at war.

812
00:40:42,750 --> 00:40:43,950
Uh,
it was really scary.

813
00:40:43,951 --> 00:40:46,520
So I still remember the very first time 
I heard a missile,

814
00:40:46,620 --> 00:40:47,453
I was watching a show on my laptop and I
heard an explosion and I didn't really 

815
00:40:51,421 --> 00:40:52,254
think anything of it.
And then I heard more explosions and 

816
00:40:54,451 --> 00:40:57,270
then there were sirens and I had no idea
what to do.

817
00:40:57,271 --> 00:41:00,180
I was living in a small house that 
didn't have a bomb shelter.

818
00:41:00,630 --> 00:41:02,040
So,
um,

819
00:41:02,250 --> 00:41:03,083
I ran outside,
my neighbors told me to run into bomb 

820
00:41:05,231 --> 00:41:08,820
shelter next door and I,
I couldn't have known.

821
00:41:08,821 --> 00:41:10,800
But then after that for the following 
months,

822
00:41:10,801 --> 00:41:15,801
it just became the norm,
like at least minimum seven times a day.

823
00:41:16,141 --> 00:41:16,974
I found myself in a bomb shelter and I 
was an English teacher at the time and 

824
00:41:20,731 --> 00:41:21,564
um,
a lot of our class time was spent 

825
00:41:22,830 --> 00:41:24,150
learning in bomb shelters.

826
00:41:24,390 --> 00:41:25,021
Yeah.
So what,

827
00:41:25,021 --> 00:41:28,500
what's that like being around kids when 
this is happening?

828
00:41:28,501 --> 00:41:29,400
I mean,
you're literally,

829
00:41:29,460 --> 00:41:31,680
I assume every school they're probably 
has a bomb shelter,

830
00:41:31,681 --> 00:41:33,030
right?
Like so the middle,

831
00:41:33,080 --> 00:41:33,980
the day you're teaching

832
00:41:33,980 --> 00:41:36,770
and then suddenly we all have to run 
downstairs.

833
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:38,390
Yeah.
So the kids know the drill.

834
00:41:38,391 --> 00:41:42,770
The kids are a yearly desensitized to 
it.

835
00:41:43,940 --> 00:41:45,350
It's just the norm for them,
you know,

836
00:41:45,351 --> 00:41:46,184
inside the bomb shelters we have 
teaching materials and it was like 

837
00:41:48,951 --> 00:41:51,380
everything just kind of kept going like 
normal for them.

838
00:41:52,030 --> 00:41:53,180
It's just part of their everyday.

839
00:41:53,380 --> 00:41:54,490
Yeah.
So then okay,

840
00:41:54,491 --> 00:41:55,324
so you were there for that and then you 
moved to Paris and you were in Paris 

841
00:41:59,351 --> 00:42:00,700
during the Paris attacks,
right?

842
00:42:01,040 --> 00:42:01,873
Yeah,
so Charlie Hebdo happened just months 

843
00:42:03,591 --> 00:42:04,424
after me arriving and my initial 
reaction was disappointment because I 

844
00:42:09,621 --> 00:42:14,621
left Israel to kind of get away from all
that a danger.

845
00:42:14,990 --> 00:42:17,150
And then I found myself in the middle of
it again.

846
00:42:18,350 --> 00:42:20,030
I was shocked.
I was really,

847
00:42:20,520 --> 00:42:21,353
I felt really angry.
And then the way people reacted to an 

848
00:42:25,160 --> 00:42:25,993
attack like that in Paris was so 
different than the way Israelis would 

849
00:42:27,911 --> 00:42:28,740
have reacted.

850
00:42:28,740 --> 00:42:30,930
So that's one of the things that I 
thought was really interesting.

851
00:42:30,931 --> 00:42:34,110
So you mentioned that,
that basically a lot of people said,

852
00:42:34,140 --> 00:42:36,720
oh,
we're defending Charlie Hebdo,

853
00:42:37,050 --> 00:42:40,950
but that really privately,
that's not really what they were doing.

854
00:42:40,951 --> 00:42:41,784
Right?

855
00:42:42,110 --> 00:42:44,540
Yeah.
So there was like a protest where people

856
00:42:44,541 --> 00:42:45,374
went out in the street and they were 
like holding up pencils and I didn't 

857
00:42:49,281 --> 00:42:50,114
want to participate in anything like 
that because I'm just thinking like the 

858
00:42:52,161 --> 00:42:55,610
people who shot these cartoonists and 
shot these artists,

859
00:42:56,150 --> 00:42:57,950
we're not trying to take away their 
pencils,

860
00:42:57,951 --> 00:42:58,784
like they were trying to kill them.
It has nothing to do with your ability 

861
00:43:03,591 --> 00:43:06,470
to write or draw a cartoon like they 
want to murder people.

862
00:43:06,471 --> 00:43:07,304
So I just felt like the reaction was 
very soft and I'm just very different 

863
00:43:11,331 --> 00:43:13,070
than the Israeli reaction would've been.

864
00:43:13,180 --> 00:43:15,400
So what,
what would the Israeli reaction be?

865
00:43:15,490 --> 00:43:16,323
I mean,
they are dealing with pretty much every 

866
00:43:17,380 --> 00:43:17,520
day.

867
00:43:17,520 --> 00:43:18,161
Really?
Yeah.

868
00:43:18,161 --> 00:43:19,420
I think we all know what the Israel,
yeah,

869
00:43:19,450 --> 00:43:21,460
reaction would have been,
would have been something.

870
00:43:21,461 --> 00:43:22,294
Um,
that's probably most of the world 

871
00:43:23,681 --> 00:43:27,910
wouldn't have been very happy with that.
Most of the world would protest against,

872
00:43:28,090 --> 00:43:28,923
um,
and something that I would have 

873
00:43:30,131 --> 00:43:32,530
protested against before I lived in 
Israel.

874
00:43:32,720 --> 00:43:33,553
When I went to Israel I was,
I wouldn't have described myself as pro 

875
00:43:36,341 --> 00:43:37,174
Israel,
but now I would because it's just very 

876
00:43:38,981 --> 00:43:39,814
different when you have missiles flying 
over your head and if it wasn't for 

877
00:43:42,611 --> 00:43:43,560
that,
um,

878
00:43:43,690 --> 00:43:45,280
iron dome interception system,
you know,

879
00:43:45,281 --> 00:43:46,114
they could just fall on your head and 
kill you and all your friends and 

880
00:43:47,411 --> 00:43:50,530
family.
So it changed my perspective completely.

881
00:43:50,720 --> 00:43:51,770
Yeah.
Interesting.

882
00:43:51,771 --> 00:43:52,341
So,
okay,

883
00:43:52,341 --> 00:43:54,770
so then you were there for Charlie Hebdo
then,

884
00:43:54,800 --> 00:43:58,640
then the more recent attacks at the 
theater.

885
00:43:58,940 --> 00:43:59,773
How has that changed a society because 
it does seem like that attack and then 

886
00:44:04,071 --> 00:44:05,430
Brussels.
Uh,

887
00:44:05,431 --> 00:44:06,264
and then we had the thing here in San 
Bernardino that now there is some 

888
00:44:10,070 --> 00:44:12,620
piecing this all together across the 
globe.

889
00:44:12,621 --> 00:44:14,870
And I think it really felt like it 
started with that one.

890
00:44:15,540 --> 00:44:16,373
I'm from San Bernardino by the way,
is all getting very close to home for 

891
00:44:19,711 --> 00:44:19,950
me,

892
00:44:19,950 --> 00:44:21,210
man.
You really are.

893
00:44:22,600 --> 00:44:23,433
Okay.
So the most recent attack was a very 

894
00:44:29,561 --> 00:44:33,210
unsettling same.
My,

895
00:44:33,480 --> 00:44:34,313
I had the same feeling towards the 
French reaction that I did for Charlie 

896
00:44:36,870 --> 00:44:38,790
Hebdo,
kind of just disappointment in the,

897
00:44:39,480 --> 00:44:40,560
the lack of,
um,

898
00:44:42,110 --> 00:44:45,860
I don't know,
have like a strong reaction.

899
00:44:45,861 --> 00:44:46,694
It was more just like a soft reaction 
that we have to protect people who 

900
00:44:49,640 --> 00:44:50,473
haven't even been insulted yet.
Everybody was just worrying about 

901
00:44:53,901 --> 00:44:54,734
hurting a certain group of people's 
feelings instead of actually trying to 

902
00:44:57,921 --> 00:45:00,350
get to the root of the problem.
Yeah.

903
00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:06,260
How deep is that?
How deep is that feeling in France that.

904
00:45:06,270 --> 00:45:06,801
Because that,
I mean,

905
00:45:06,801 --> 00:45:07,634
that's what we talked about when we 
talked about this regressive ideology 

906
00:45:09,710 --> 00:45:11,600
that we care more about feelings over 
facts.

907
00:45:11,601 --> 00:45:14,870
How much does that sort of seeped into 
society over there?

908
00:45:15,630 --> 00:45:18,750
I would say probably even more so than 
in America.

909
00:45:19,590 --> 00:45:20,423
Um,
people here are very concerned about 

910
00:45:21,631 --> 00:45:25,410
being politically correct.
I'm in a country that has a very high,

911
00:45:25,411 --> 00:45:29,160
a percentage of north Africans and 
Muslims.

912
00:45:30,990 --> 00:45:32,910
People are very careful to choose their 
words.

913
00:45:32,911 --> 00:45:34,360
The media,
um,

914
00:45:34,710 --> 00:45:38,430
is very careful about what they say and 
how they say it,

915
00:45:38,520 --> 00:45:39,353
which is a good thing and a bad thing.
But I would say that now things have 

916
00:45:44,671 --> 00:45:46,110
kind of died down,
honestly.

917
00:45:46,111 --> 00:45:50,580
People have kind of forgotten about it.
Security is very lax everywhere.

918
00:45:50,640 --> 00:45:51,473
Um,
they still have some like emergency 

919
00:45:54,061 --> 00:45:56,280
procedures in place ever since Charlie 
Hebdo,

920
00:45:56,281 --> 00:45:59,790
so it's been almost two years that we've
had these emergency procedures.

921
00:46:00,180 --> 00:46:03,150
They're supposed to be in place,
but like private and public security and

922
00:46:03,151 --> 00:46:06,150
Francis just not where it should be.

923
00:46:06,380 --> 00:46:08,360
Yeah.
So the other thing that I wanted to talk

924
00:46:08,361 --> 00:46:10,380
to you about or that you mentioned is 
that there's,

925
00:46:10,440 --> 00:46:12,560
there's two things happening in France 
right now.

926
00:46:12,561 --> 00:46:15,170
So one is,
is the immigration situation,

927
00:46:15,530 --> 00:46:18,110
uh,
so you have all these migrants coming in

928
00:46:18,260 --> 00:46:22,790
and then at the same time basically 
Jewish emigration from France.

929
00:46:22,791 --> 00:46:24,890
So Jews leaving France is at an all time
high.

930
00:46:25,130 --> 00:46:25,963
I was actually in Israel in November and
I heard a tremendous amount of French 

931
00:46:30,020 --> 00:46:31,400
being spoken there.
I couldn't believe it.

932
00:46:31,401 --> 00:46:32,810
I mean,
there were signs in French.

933
00:46:32,960 --> 00:46:36,770
All the places that were selling houses 
were written in Hebrew and in French.

934
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:38,040
Um,
so what,

935
00:46:38,060 --> 00:46:38,893
what's going on there?

936
00:46:39,350 --> 00:46:41,380
So I can't speak too much about,
um,

937
00:46:42,050 --> 00:46:45,260
the immigration of refugees to France 
because honestly,

938
00:46:45,261 --> 00:46:48,110
when you hear about it on the news,
but it doesn't affect me at all.

939
00:46:48,111 --> 00:46:51,920
I don't see them.
It just doesn't play a role in my life.

940
00:46:51,921 --> 00:46:53,660
So I can't really speak on that.
But,

941
00:46:53,661 --> 00:46:54,494
um,
I have been very involved in the French 

942
00:46:57,290 --> 00:46:58,123
Jewish community,
so I know how they feel about the 

943
00:47:00,680 --> 00:47:01,513
situation in France and in Israel.
So there's kind of this feeling and the 

944
00:47:04,461 --> 00:47:05,294
French Jewish community,
I don't want to say I'm not a victim 

945
00:47:08,931 --> 00:47:09,561
hood,
but,

946
00:47:09,561 --> 00:47:10,394
uh,
they're very closed a network of people 

947
00:47:13,221 --> 00:47:14,054
like in the Paris area and um,
they always feel targeted and they feel 

948
00:47:18,651 --> 00:47:21,320
like Israel is kind of like this 
Eldorado.

949
00:47:21,380 --> 00:47:22,213
It's like this thing that they idolize 
and it's like this ideal utopia that 

950
00:47:25,341 --> 00:47:27,300
they all want to,
uh,

951
00:47:27,770 --> 00:47:29,170
strive to be a part of.

952
00:47:29,620 --> 00:47:30,453
So every time there's an attack,
it's like the percentage of French Jews 

953
00:47:33,911 --> 00:47:34,744
that leave France just skyrockets.
But then another interesting phenomenon 

954
00:47:39,700 --> 00:47:40,533
is that when I was in Israel,
I met so many people who leave Israel 

955
00:47:44,530 --> 00:47:46,780
after intending to settle.
They're just like I did.

956
00:47:47,890 --> 00:47:49,600
There's actually a word in Hebrew for 
that.

957
00:47:49,601 --> 00:47:50,434
It's called Marita.
So Alia is when you immigrate to Israel 

958
00:47:53,171 --> 00:47:54,004
to go live there supposedly forever.
Then there's even a word to describe 

959
00:47:57,010 --> 00:48:00,100
leaving there forever because you just 
can't handle the quality of life.

960
00:48:00,101 --> 00:48:02,950
So French people encounter that.
They leave.

961
00:48:03,040 --> 00:48:03,873
I'm hoping to find this,
a network of acceptance and like living 

962
00:48:06,941 --> 00:48:10,390
amongst Jews just going to be amazing 
and then they get there and realize that

963
00:48:10,420 --> 00:48:12,670
they were kind of sold a dream and a lot
come back.

964
00:48:13,190 --> 00:48:14,023
Yeah.
So it's sorta like the grass is always 

965
00:48:15,351 --> 00:48:17,240
greener.
You have it one way then you think.

966
00:48:17,241 --> 00:48:19,010
Okay,
it's going to be better over there.

967
00:48:20,360 --> 00:48:21,440
Um,
all right,

968
00:48:21,441 --> 00:48:22,274
well you've given me a lot and we're,
we're plowing through all these 

969
00:48:24,381 --> 00:48:26,840
interviews,
but it was a pleasure talking to you and

970
00:48:26,841 --> 00:48:27,674
uh,
and good luck with the rest of your 

971
00:48:28,790 --> 00:48:30,650
adventures.
Thank you so much.

972
00:48:30,760 --> 00:48:32,750
All right,
I'm on with Ferran in Canada.

973
00:48:32,780 --> 00:48:33,613
Aaron,
how are you?

974
00:48:34,250 --> 00:48:34,941
I'm good,
thanks.

975
00:48:34,941 --> 00:48:35,880
How are you doing guy?

976
00:48:36,080 --> 00:48:36,913
I'm doing well.
I've been enjoying talking to all these 

977
00:48:38,391 --> 00:48:39,680
great people.
So,

978
00:48:39,681 --> 00:48:41,990
uh,
what's going on up in Canada these days?

979
00:48:42,080 --> 00:48:42,913
How's Canada?

980
00:48:43,760 --> 00:48:45,370
Oh,
Canada's fine.

981
00:48:45,670 --> 00:48:49,410
Uh,
not as libertarian leanings.

982
00:48:49,420 --> 00:48:52,910
I'd like to turn myself,
but uh,

983
00:48:52,911 --> 00:48:54,280
I'm working on it.
Uh,

984
00:48:54,281 --> 00:48:55,870
I,
I'm uh,

985
00:48:55,871 --> 00:48:56,704
I work with a organization called 
students for liberty and I'm currently 

986
00:49:00,191 --> 00:49:03,670
going through training to be kind of in 
charge of the,

987
00:49:03,720 --> 00:49:05,320
uh,
Canada.

988
00:49:06,110 --> 00:49:11,110
A sect of students for liberty.
So working towards liberty.

989
00:49:11,980 --> 00:49:12,390
Yeah.

990
00:49:12,390 --> 00:49:12,961
Yeah.
Well,

991
00:49:12,961 --> 00:49:13,794
as you know,
I've kind of been into libertarianism 

992
00:49:15,541 --> 00:49:16,374
lately.
I think it's very close to classic 

993
00:49:17,521 --> 00:49:18,354
liberalism,
which is really where I consider myself 

994
00:49:20,480 --> 00:49:22,290
a.
But speaking of your political leanings,

995
00:49:22,291 --> 00:49:23,124
my producer told me just a minute before
we connected that apparently you're in 

996
00:49:26,491 --> 00:49:29,640
breitbart related to something about 
Milo.

997
00:49:30,090 --> 00:49:33,870
Yes.
I just read the article this morning.

998
00:49:34,280 --> 00:49:35,113
Can you tell me what it is?
He literally just screamed something in 

999
00:49:36,201 --> 00:49:37,034
my ear and then ran off.

1000
00:49:37,850 --> 00:49:40,230
Sure.
While the name of the articles,

1001
00:49:40,250 --> 00:49:41,083
like a,
it's called Chinese for trump and it's 

1002
00:49:43,521 --> 00:49:47,490
basically talking about trans woman who 
a,

1003
00:49:48,110 --> 00:49:51,050
either like Donald Trump or support him 
fully.

1004
00:49:51,051 --> 00:49:55,340
I don't fully support him,
but I liked him in many ways and I think

1005
00:49:55,341 --> 00:49:59,810
his presidency could in some ways 
actually be helpful.

1006
00:49:59,930 --> 00:50:00,763
Yeah.
But that's a strange place to be for a 

1007
00:50:01,581 --> 00:50:02,480
libertarian,
right?

1008
00:50:02,481 --> 00:50:05,150
Because he seems to be a big government,
more of a liberal guy.

1009
00:50:05,151 --> 00:50:05,984
But I think you like the,
you like the sort of trolling 

1010
00:50:08,181 --> 00:50:09,710
unpolitical,
correct.

1011
00:50:10,300 --> 00:50:13,360
I don't,
I don't agree with his trade policies.

1012
00:50:13,361 --> 00:50:16,870
I think that their economic 10 letter at
A.

1013
00:50:16,871 --> 00:50:21,100
I don't have a particularly strong 
stance on his immigration policies.

1014
00:50:21,550 --> 00:50:24,040
Uh,
yeah.

1015
00:50:24,041 --> 00:50:25,870
So I'm not,
I don't really like that.

1016
00:50:25,950 --> 00:50:26,783
And uh,
I read an article just the other day 

1017
00:50:29,271 --> 00:50:32,240
that uh,
if he comes with his president,

1018
00:50:32,300 --> 00:50:33,133
if he becomes president,
that things like taxes to be resent and 

1019
00:50:36,740 --> 00:50:39,470
minimum wage would.
So not that much.

1020
00:50:40,330 --> 00:50:44,550
It's a strange place for a libertarian.
I don't support him,

1021
00:50:44,551 --> 00:50:46,210
but there are certain parts of him that 
I like.

1022
00:50:46,710 --> 00:50:47,810
Um.
All right.

1023
00:50:47,820 --> 00:50:50,400
So you gave me a lot on your,
on your email entry.

1024
00:50:50,401 --> 00:50:51,690
So let's,
let's dive right into it.

1025
00:50:51,691 --> 00:50:54,090
So first of all,
you're a men's rights activist,

1026
00:50:54,091 --> 00:50:55,380
correct?
Yes.

1027
00:50:55,440 --> 00:50:56,273
So can you explain what that means 
because I think a certain set of people 

1028
00:50:58,321 --> 00:51:01,720
get that and then another set think that
something crazy and then,

1029
00:51:01,760 --> 00:51:04,290
but I think the bulk of people just 
don't even understand what that means.

1030
00:51:05,980 --> 00:51:06,813
So a lot of people don't necessarily 
realize that they're not informed about 

1031
00:51:11,951 --> 00:51:12,784
the fact that men are falling behind or 
are discriminated against in many ways 

1032
00:51:17,381 --> 00:51:18,910
in today's society,
in,

1033
00:51:19,760 --> 00:51:21,730
in Canada,
in America,

1034
00:51:22,510 --> 00:51:23,343
whether it's the high suicide rates,
whether it's the high rates of 

1035
00:51:25,121 --> 00:51:26,830
homelessness,
uh,

1036
00:51:26,831 --> 00:51:29,530
whether it's um,
you know,

1037
00:51:29,560 --> 00:51:30,393
men kind of getting the short end of the
stick legally nowadays with all these 

1038
00:51:35,540 --> 00:51:38,020
rape cases.
Um,

1039
00:51:38,230 --> 00:51:40,230
and uh,
and,

1040
00:51:40,231 --> 00:51:41,064
and then there's domestic violence,
which is also a huge problem and men 

1041
00:51:43,571 --> 00:51:47,350
really don't get seen.
And the statistics on the knowledge on,

1042
00:51:47,380 --> 00:51:48,850
on,
on the true,

1043
00:51:48,870 --> 00:51:51,310
the reality of domestic violence isn't 
really,

1044
00:51:52,630 --> 00:51:55,950
isn't really known to most people.
So I,

1045
00:51:55,951 --> 00:51:56,940
I'm,
I'm not an,

1046
00:51:57,040 --> 00:52:00,160
I'm more than just an advocate.
I'm an activist.

1047
00:52:00,470 --> 00:52:05,470
I lead a men's rights group on my campus
at Simon Fraser University and uh,

1048
00:52:06,170 --> 00:52:07,003
we host monthly events inviting 
different people with different 

1049
00:52:10,271 --> 00:52:12,100
perspectives on men's issues.

1050
00:52:12,320 --> 00:52:15,340
Uh,
we had Karen Straughn and uh,

1051
00:52:15,670 --> 00:52:16,503
uh,
I listened to him and last month and 

1052
00:52:18,311 --> 00:52:21,850
they have this coming up month.
We're having a panel discussion event on

1053
00:52:22,180 --> 00:52:26,650
different perspectives of the 
masculinity from men going their own way

1054
00:52:26,651 --> 00:52:27,484
to mythic poetic,
which you probably don't know if you're 

1055
00:52:29,591 --> 00:52:30,424
not into the man's married Merryman,
and then there's the feminist 

1056
00:52:32,111 --> 00:52:33,150
perspective.
So we're going to hold up,

1057
00:52:33,160 --> 00:52:37,090
have a whole panel discussion.
So it's really about boots on the ground

1058
00:52:37,120 --> 00:52:40,750
activism.
I'm really engaging with people,

1059
00:52:40,960 --> 00:52:41,793
so I'm kind of taking the online.
I'm one of the people taking online's 

1060
00:52:44,680 --> 00:52:47,980
fail offline and trying to raise 
awareness one on one.

1061
00:52:48,090 --> 00:52:48,923
Yeah.
So I think for the average person 

1062
00:52:49,891 --> 00:52:51,840
watching this that doesn't know much 
about these issues,

1063
00:52:51,841 --> 00:52:53,370
they're probably looking at you and 
saying,

1064
00:52:53,371 --> 00:52:54,204
wait a minute,
here's a trans woman into men's rights 

1065
00:52:57,360 --> 00:52:58,193
issues.
That kind of flips everything on its 

1066
00:53:00,271 --> 00:53:01,104
head.
Does that give you a certain cache 

1067
00:53:03,750 --> 00:53:04,770
within the community?

1068
00:53:05,630 --> 00:53:07,420
Um,
I think that,

1069
00:53:07,450 --> 00:53:12,450
um,
it gives me a lot of freedom to say what

1070
00:53:12,720 --> 00:53:17,720
is churn without being labeled a 
misogynist or sexist or this or that.

1071
00:53:18,190 --> 00:53:22,450
I said a lot of things that if some 
average white guy said it,

1072
00:53:23,130 --> 00:53:23,963
he would be maligned a,
I think my being trans has helped a lot 

1073
00:53:31,620 --> 00:53:35,010
for our club in the sense that we 
haven't been protested much.

1074
00:53:35,280 --> 00:53:37,170
We have,
while we haven't protested at all,

1075
00:53:37,171 --> 00:53:38,004
we haven't got too much backlash and I 
think it's because in the kind of 

1076
00:53:41,850 --> 00:53:44,340
regressive mindsets,
uh,

1077
00:53:44,640 --> 00:53:45,473
attacking a group that's led by what is 
in their minds and oppressed minority 

1078
00:53:49,321 --> 00:53:52,070
would be oppressing the minority.
Even thought that.

1079
00:53:53,860 --> 00:53:54,693
Yeah.
So you're sort of like Kryptonite in a 

1080
00:53:55,951 --> 00:54:00,690
way to them because because they judge 
you not by your individual ideas.

1081
00:54:00,930 --> 00:54:01,763
Right?
But they're judging you as solely a 

1082
00:54:03,901 --> 00:54:04,734
trans person.
They know the trans person is high on 

1083
00:54:07,050 --> 00:54:10,830
the oppression Olympics chart,
so then they can't really figure out how

1084
00:54:10,831 --> 00:54:13,800
to attack you versus you're able to 
protect your own ideas.

1085
00:54:13,801 --> 00:54:14,400
I mean,
it's,

1086
00:54:14,400 --> 00:54:16,440
it's actually kind of genius and also 
bonkers.

1087
00:54:16,730 --> 00:54:18,630
Well,
well it's genius on.

1088
00:54:18,631 --> 00:54:19,470
Yes,
bonkers.

1089
00:54:19,471 --> 00:54:20,304
I kind of realized that very early on,
I realized when I realized that the 

1090
00:54:24,450 --> 00:54:29,450
reality of men's issues and how there 
isn't much a lot of spokespeople for men

1091
00:54:31,081 --> 00:54:34,350
and men who suffer a,
I realized that if,

1092
00:54:34,710 --> 00:54:35,543
if not me,
who are and who better than a 

1093
00:54:37,630 --> 00:54:38,463
transwoman,
I realized right away the position I'm 

1094
00:54:40,531 --> 00:54:45,300
in and how I would be squandering a 
really great opportunity.

1095
00:54:45,301 --> 00:54:46,134
So I totally,
I totally use my identity as a trans 

1096
00:54:48,471 --> 00:54:49,304
woman to further men's rights and I'm 
not really ashamed of it because I want 

1097
00:54:52,261 --> 00:54:55,530
to help men and I want to further their 
discretion.

1098
00:54:55,660 --> 00:54:56,493
Yeah.
So obviously I get the part that you've 

1099
00:54:58,751 --> 00:55:01,540
sort of insulated yourself from some of 
the criticism,

1100
00:55:01,541 --> 00:55:04,020
but when you do get the criticism,
it,

1101
00:55:04,030 --> 00:55:09,030
does it feel particularly personal to 
you because you're trans and that,

1102
00:55:10,090 --> 00:55:11,860
uh,
I talked to another trans person,

1103
00:55:12,040 --> 00:55:12,873
uh,
that sort of like the thing of the 

1104
00:55:14,111 --> 00:55:14,944
moment.

1105
00:55:16,510 --> 00:55:17,343
Um,

1106
00:55:17,880 --> 00:55:18,460
no,
no,

1107
00:55:18,460 --> 00:55:19,251
I,
I don't know.

1108
00:55:19,251 --> 00:55:24,251
I criticism I get from kind of the 
regressive side.

1109
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:27,420
Um,
I don't know.

1110
00:55:27,940 --> 00:55:31,900
They don't generally try to really steer
away from the fact that I'm trans.

1111
00:55:32,500 --> 00:55:33,333
A lot of them.
The criticism that has been launched at 

1112
00:55:36,371 --> 00:55:41,371
our club haven't even recognized me as 
the president then kind of try that.

1113
00:55:42,661 --> 00:55:45,550
It wouldn't touch with a 10 foot pole.
Um,

1114
00:55:46,230 --> 00:55:47,063
I mean I get criticism for being a 
female men's rights activists in 

1115
00:55:50,231 --> 00:55:50,920
general.
I mean,

1116
00:55:50,920 --> 00:55:51,753
there are other people could take issue 
with that because it's just kind of 

1117
00:55:54,761 --> 00:55:57,130
perpetuating a,
you know,

1118
00:55:57,131 --> 00:55:58,630
everyone focusing on women.

1119
00:55:59,500 --> 00:56:00,820
Are there other women in the group?

1120
00:56:02,200 --> 00:56:03,910
Yes.
It's actually our,

1121
00:56:03,911 --> 00:56:08,911
our executive team is a three women and 
one guy.

1122
00:56:12,430 --> 00:56:13,650
I mean,
that's really fascinating.

1123
00:56:14,530 --> 00:56:15,720
Yeah.
Uh,

1124
00:56:16,270 --> 00:56:18,910
I find women or are law,
uh,

1125
00:56:19,120 --> 00:56:19,953
it's a lot easier for them to approach,
let's say we're titling at club does so 

1126
00:56:23,231 --> 00:56:24,064
much easier for them to approach our 
table and start discussing and they 

1127
00:56:27,791 --> 00:56:28,624
don't fear A.
I find a lot of men are kind of a kind 

1128
00:56:31,931 --> 00:56:33,150
of weary,
uh,

1129
00:56:33,220 --> 00:56:35,890
they're very afraid that they're going 
to be judged as a certain,

1130
00:56:35,940 --> 00:56:36,773
you know,
as they're going to be judged as 

1131
00:56:37,511 --> 00:56:38,344
misogynistic or sexist or why are you,
why are you associating with those 

1132
00:56:40,961 --> 00:56:45,510
people?
So it's actually quite a bit easier to,

1133
00:56:45,511 --> 00:56:47,710
um,
to attract women.

1134
00:56:47,711 --> 00:56:50,980
But then when I hear about the men who 
are,

1135
00:56:51,490 --> 00:56:54,370
who do come talk to us,
uh,

1136
00:56:54,371 --> 00:56:59,260
the men who kind of stir up the bribery,
I have quite horrible stories,

1137
00:56:59,480 --> 00:57:00,220
uh,
in our,

1138
00:57:00,220 --> 00:57:01,053
from being horribly abused by their 
girlfriends or having narcissistic 

1139
00:57:05,861 --> 00:57:10,780
mothers and fathers.
Then I'm just,

1140
00:57:10,900 --> 00:57:11,733
I hear,
I hear already that truth of what's 

1141
00:57:13,271 --> 00:57:14,620
going on.
Uh,

1142
00:57:15,100 --> 00:57:16,930
and yeah,
I would encourage men to,

1143
00:57:16,931 --> 00:57:21,250
um,
to come to a protest more because we are

1144
00:57:21,251 --> 00:57:23,650
in that sense,
kind of a safe space,

1145
00:57:23,651 --> 00:57:24,484
if you will.

1146
00:57:25,590 --> 00:57:27,390
I would say spaces,
right?

1147
00:57:28,330 --> 00:57:29,020
Uh,
I like,

1148
00:57:29,020 --> 00:57:29,610
I,
I'm,

1149
00:57:29,610 --> 00:57:34,050
I don't like spices if that means that 
you can't talk about certain things,

1150
00:57:34,290 --> 00:57:38,920
but that's not really what it means in 
all contexts and more means that we want

1151
00:57:38,921 --> 00:57:39,754
malign you if you feel certain ways,
if you feel angry because a lot of men 

1152
00:57:43,161 --> 00:57:43,994
are angry and I understand that anger.
I'm not going to tell them that they're 

1153
00:57:47,251 --> 00:57:50,060
just misogynists and sexists.
Um,

1154
00:57:51,130 --> 00:57:51,963
they're not going to get judged.
They're going to have at least an 

1155
00:57:53,911 --> 00:57:55,920
understanding.
Yeah.

1156
00:57:56,610 --> 00:57:59,340
It's about it.
It's not a safe space of ideas.

1157
00:57:59,370 --> 00:58:01,860
It's just a,
a safe space of judgment.

1158
00:58:01,861 --> 00:58:02,970
Which are two different things.

1159
00:58:03,490 --> 00:58:05,860
It's an understanding,
compassionate space.

1160
00:58:05,861 --> 00:58:06,694
How about that?

1161
00:58:06,860 --> 00:58:08,350
Yeah.
Um,

1162
00:58:08,540 --> 00:58:10,550
so what's,
what's next after this?

1163
00:58:10,551 --> 00:58:11,121
So,
you know,

1164
00:58:11,121 --> 00:58:11,954
when you get out of school,
is this something that you want to 

1165
00:58:13,700 --> 00:58:17,270
pursue it at a career level or are you 
interested in other things altogether?

1166
00:58:18,430 --> 00:58:19,263
Well,
I'm currently finishing up my music 

1167
00:58:20,441 --> 00:58:21,274
composition degree,
which is completely separate from what 

1168
00:58:23,441 --> 00:58:24,274
I'm doing,
but I actually want to go into law and 

1169
00:58:27,010 --> 00:58:29,740
probably constitutional law.
But um,

1170
00:58:30,310 --> 00:58:31,390
I think in,
in,

1171
00:58:31,391 --> 00:58:33,250
in my past and law,
I can,

1172
00:58:33,600 --> 00:58:38,120
I'm definitely influenced some real,
at least legal challenge,

1173
00:58:38,390 --> 00:58:40,980
uh,
where it helps men and,

1174
00:58:40,981 --> 00:58:44,120
but also just defending constitutional 
rights and,

1175
00:58:44,121 --> 00:58:44,954
and you know,
our human rights on a very basic level 

1176
00:58:46,961 --> 00:58:51,961
and a kind of putting my effort into 
keeping the state

1177
00:58:52,370 --> 00:58:55,070
small.
That's the libertarian part.

1178
00:58:55,400 --> 00:58:57,860
There you go.
Well listen,

1179
00:58:57,861 --> 00:58:58,694
we could obviously do a lot more,
but unfortunately we gotta we gotta cut 

1180
00:59:00,801 --> 00:59:01,634
it short,
so I really enjoyed talking to you and 

1181
00:59:02,661 --> 00:59:03,620
uh,
good luck with everything.

1182
00:59:04,160 --> 00:59:05,510
I enjoyed talking to you as well.
Um,

1183
00:59:05,511 --> 00:59:07,240
thank you so much for the opportunity 
Dave.

1184
00:59:07,540 --> 00:59:09,790
Alright,
I'm on with Tomi from the UK.

1185
00:59:09,791 --> 00:59:10,780
Tommy,
has it gone?

1186
00:59:11,410 --> 00:59:12,700
Very good.
Thank you very much.

1187
00:59:12,701 --> 00:59:14,500
How are you?
I'm doing well.

1188
00:59:14,530 --> 00:59:16,120
Uh,
so your story,

1189
00:59:16,121 --> 00:59:16,954
you know,
everyone's sending me these great sort 

1190
00:59:17,751 --> 00:59:19,750
of life stories and what they want to 
talk about.

1191
00:59:20,080 --> 00:59:22,070
There was something interesting

1192
00:59:22,070 --> 00:59:22,903
right at the beginning of yours.
You're originally from Nigeria and you 

1193
00:59:26,331 --> 00:59:30,050
moved to the UK the day before nine 
slash 11.

1194
00:59:30,260 --> 00:59:33,920
So you moved on September 10th,
2001.

1195
00:59:33,950 --> 00:59:36,200
Can you describe a little bit of that?

1196
00:59:36,810 --> 00:59:37,643
Yeah.
Um,

1197
00:59:37,710 --> 00:59:42,090
when I first got the news about that I 
was a topical double decker,

1198
00:59:42,091 --> 00:59:43,380
you know,
the sort of British buses.

1199
00:59:43,410 --> 00:59:44,190
Sure.
What the,

1200
00:59:44,190 --> 00:59:45,023
the two stage,
the two level of bosses are the top of 

1201
00:59:46,681 --> 00:59:50,010
that and that's when we heard the news 
about that something has happened in New

1202
00:59:50,010 --> 00:59:53,260
York and some explosion of something 
about abusers.

1203
00:59:53,310 --> 00:59:54,143
And then we go home and then I sort of 
saw the peaches about all of what 

1204
00:59:57,541 --> 01:00:00,660
happened and you know,
it didn't,

1205
01:00:00,810 --> 01:00:04,770
I didn't really understand the gravity 
of what had happened.

1206
01:00:05,040 --> 01:00:06,330
I mean,
I understood it was,

1207
01:00:06,570 --> 01:00:07,620
you know,
horrible thing.

1208
01:00:08,070 --> 01:00:08,880
Um,
and uh,

1209
01:00:08,880 --> 01:00:11,510
many people died book,
it wasn't years,

1210
01:00:11,550 --> 01:00:14,350
so he is elated.
I sort of really understood,

1211
01:00:14,360 --> 01:00:15,031
I,
you know,

1212
01:00:15,031 --> 01:00:17,730
the world has changed in any radical 
way.

1213
01:00:17,731 --> 01:00:22,731
So that was sort of my,
my earliest memory coming into the UK.

1214
01:00:23,540 --> 01:00:24,373
Um,
so in a sense of sort of a baptism of 

1215
01:00:28,470 --> 01:00:29,640
fire sorts.
Yeah.

1216
01:00:29,750 --> 01:00:32,210
Talk about a crazy time to move to the 
west.

1217
01:00:32,211 --> 01:00:35,630
So let's back up a little bit.
Tell me a little bit about growing up in

1218
01:00:35,631 --> 01:00:36,371
Nigeria.
What,

1219
01:00:36,371 --> 01:00:37,204
what kind of family you came from and 
what made you guys move to the UK or do 

1220
01:00:40,341 --> 01:00:42,090
or did you move by yourself?
I'm actually on it.

1221
01:00:42,310 --> 01:00:43,210
No,
I moving,

1222
01:00:43,270 --> 01:00:44,710
I'm moving my father,
my mother,

1223
01:00:44,740 --> 01:00:46,960
my mother.
My mother is a nurse.

1224
01:00:46,990 --> 01:00:51,860
She wasn't as many as Nigeria.
I'm going to say she because of you,

1225
01:00:51,940 --> 01:00:53,530
you do know we have an nhs.
Yeah.

1226
01:00:53,840 --> 01:00:56,590
And there's a high demand for nurses in 
the UK.

1227
01:00:56,880 --> 01:01:01,390
So she moved over to the UK about two 
years before we moved to join her on.

1228
01:01:01,391 --> 01:01:02,224
My father was a journalist and used to 
be an editor in oil and gas magazine in 

1229
01:01:05,861 --> 01:01:07,990
Nigeria.
So we moved together and myself,

1230
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:11,800
my younger brother would move together 
with him on and we moved basically,

1231
01:01:11,801 --> 01:01:14,320
essentially to have the best education 
in the UK,

1232
01:01:14,680 --> 01:01:15,970
um,
antidote our mother.

1233
01:01:16,060 --> 01:01:17,950
And so that was,
you know,

1234
01:01:18,080 --> 01:01:21,160
a little bit.
It's my family.

1235
01:01:21,161 --> 01:01:21,570
It's true.

1236
01:01:21,570 --> 01:01:22,071
Yeah.
What,

1237
01:01:22,071 --> 01:01:24,030
what was life like in Nigeria?
People,

1238
01:01:24,031 --> 01:01:25,740
you know,
you hear about Nigeria but we don't know

1239
01:01:25,741 --> 01:01:27,530
really.
At least here in the West or in the US,

1240
01:01:27,540 --> 01:01:28,373
we don't talk about Nigeria that much.
Tell me a little bit about what it was 

1241
01:01:30,131 --> 01:01:30,820
like,

1242
01:01:30,820 --> 01:01:32,070
um,
growing up in Nigeria,

1243
01:01:32,150 --> 01:01:33,750
life was fun.
Um,

1244
01:01:33,830 --> 01:01:34,663
you know,
you out there with your friends playing 

1245
01:01:36,110 --> 01:01:39,620
it was in a child,
childhood was the best time,

1246
01:01:39,621 --> 01:01:40,760
you know,
you know,

1247
01:01:40,920 --> 01:01:41,753
can the world.
Although during the time when I was 

1248
01:01:43,671 --> 01:01:46,130
going in Nigeria growing up in Nigeria,
we had the dictator,

1249
01:01:46,460 --> 01:01:47,540
general sunny.
I betcha.

1250
01:01:47,990 --> 01:01:49,180
Um,
and he,

1251
01:01:49,181 --> 01:01:51,430
he was a very ruthless guy.
Um,

1252
01:01:51,460 --> 01:01:52,293
you know,
destroyed the country to meet a lot of 

1253
01:01:53,691 --> 01:01:55,940
ways economically embezzled a lot of 
money.

1254
01:01:56,810 --> 01:01:57,643
But Nigeria is a very resilient.
They are probably the most resilient 

1255
01:02:01,041 --> 01:02:02,470
people in the world,
you know,

1256
01:02:02,820 --> 01:02:05,810
you put them in the middle of the Sahara
desert,

1257
01:02:05,811 --> 01:02:10,280
they start sending you sand say so 
Nigeria's a very resilient.

1258
01:02:10,281 --> 01:02:11,100
So we,
we,

1259
01:02:11,100 --> 01:02:12,080
we,
we got through,

1260
01:02:12,081 --> 01:02:13,310
we survived,
we did well,

1261
01:02:13,311 --> 01:02:14,900
you know,
went to school and things like that.

1262
01:02:15,280 --> 01:02:17,650
Um,
but towards me,

1263
01:02:18,380 --> 01:02:19,213
towards the time I was coming to the UK,
he passed away and there was massive 

1264
01:02:22,741 --> 01:02:24,540
parties in the streets and everything 
like that.

1265
01:02:24,541 --> 01:02:25,440
So,
uh,

1266
01:02:25,480 --> 01:02:28,530
yeah,
so that starts how much hated he was.

1267
01:02:28,890 --> 01:02:29,320
Um,

1268
01:02:29,320 --> 01:02:32,080
and then did another dictator come in 
right after him.

1269
01:02:32,130 --> 01:02:33,640
I don't even know the history

1270
01:02:33,920 --> 01:02:36,150
after that we had a civilian,
um,

1271
01:02:36,160 --> 01:02:36,930
um,
uh,

1272
01:02:36,930 --> 01:02:40,130
we had the office democracy after many 
years of,

1273
01:02:40,320 --> 01:02:41,730
of going through,
um,

1274
01:02:41,790 --> 01:02:42,623
generals and dictates is basically.
And so we had a passenger will become 

1275
01:02:47,191 --> 01:02:50,400
president and he ruled,
boy,

1276
01:02:50,490 --> 01:02:53,370
he was also corrupt in many ways.
Um,

1277
01:02:53,371 --> 01:02:56,850
and,
and he's also from the same tribe that I

1278
01:02:56,851 --> 01:02:57,684
am in Nigeria,
but many from my partner and Andrea 

1279
01:03:00,510 --> 01:03:02,490
especially,
my dad didn't like it because it was not

1280
01:03:02,491 --> 01:03:03,324
a fan man.
So,

1281
01:03:03,740 --> 01:03:04,620
um,
we had that,

1282
01:03:04,621 --> 01:03:07,580
but now we were a country that's 
struggling a lot.

1283
01:03:08,040 --> 01:03:11,880
We just had our,
our president's going to the UK for some

1284
01:03:11,900 --> 01:03:16,310
anticorruption socks and he's trying to 
give back some money because the country

1285
01:03:16,311 --> 01:03:20,520
has been really hammered by,
by previous regime is basically.

1286
01:03:20,630 --> 01:03:21,201
Yeah.
All right.

1287
01:03:21,201 --> 01:03:22,034
So let's flash forward to today.
One of the things that you wanted to 

1288
01:03:24,111 --> 01:03:26,410
talk to me about,
something that we've touched on the show

1289
01:03:26,520 --> 01:03:28,400
I'll just a tiny bit,
but brexit,

1290
01:03:28,401 --> 01:03:30,080
it's obviously huge for you guys over 
there.

1291
01:03:30,260 --> 01:03:31,370
Now.
You Support Brexit,

1292
01:03:31,371 --> 01:03:32,090
right?

1293
01:03:32,090 --> 01:03:34,220
Yes.
I am a big supporter of brexit.

1294
01:03:34,221 --> 01:03:35,054
I'm a big supporter of Brazil as an 
engineer and I'm a big supporter as a 

1295
01:03:37,701 --> 01:03:41,120
first generation immigrant out in 
support of breast as a British citizen.

1296
01:03:41,540 --> 01:03:42,373
And it,
it,

1297
01:03:42,450 --> 01:03:47,120
it rests essentially on this principle.
I asked myself this question if I was in

1298
01:03:47,121 --> 01:03:50,390
Nigeria and I found that,
that the,

1299
01:03:50,570 --> 01:03:51,403
uh,
the political system was controlled by 

1300
01:03:55,131 --> 01:03:58,730
another political system that was based 
in Cairo in Egypt,

1301
01:03:59,090 --> 01:03:59,923
and they've made it past our laws.
They told us what to do with our fishes 

1302
01:04:03,121 --> 01:04:05,600
and in our waters and all that kind of 
stuff.

1303
01:04:05,980 --> 01:04:07,810
I'd give upset about that.
I'll say,

1304
01:04:07,880 --> 01:04:09,800
I'll say that's not fair.
We can't.

1305
01:04:10,110 --> 01:04:10,943
Nigeria's should have control over their
own laws and over their own borders and 

1306
01:04:16,281 --> 01:04:17,820
everything.
So I,

1307
01:04:17,860 --> 01:04:21,730
I look at it from a point of view.
He's Nigerian living in Nigeria and this

1308
01:04:21,780 --> 01:04:22,613
happens in Nigeria.
How would I feel and tickets to the UK 

1309
01:04:25,551 --> 01:04:28,100
now that is exactly what is happening to
the UK.

1310
01:04:28,430 --> 01:04:29,263
We have a situation whereby we have a 
European Commission that is not elected 

1311
01:04:32,510 --> 01:04:36,530
or passes a law that we have to abide to
and we can vote them out of office.

1312
01:04:36,770 --> 01:04:40,820
So it's essentially a sort of a 
dictatorial system of sorts.

1313
01:04:41,080 --> 01:04:41,913
Yeah.
So how much of your feelings about that 

1314
01:04:43,571 --> 01:04:46,870
is fueled by just the border situation?
Because one of the things,

1315
01:04:47,020 --> 01:04:47,853
I think we've done about 12 interviews 
now and one of the things that almost 

1316
01:04:50,411 --> 01:04:51,244
everyone has wanted to talk to me about 
in Europe is the immigration stuff and 

1317
01:04:54,011 --> 01:04:56,320
the border stuff and the migrant stuff 
and all that.

1318
01:04:56,410 --> 01:04:57,243
So how much of your feeling is just 
wrapped up just in that you want the UK 

1319
01:05:00,401 --> 01:05:02,200
to be able to control its own borders?

1320
01:05:02,530 --> 01:05:03,530
I,
I think that's,

1321
01:05:03,560 --> 01:05:04,393
I think that's an,
I think that's a very essential part of 

1322
01:05:07,730 --> 01:05:11,030
the brexit argument.
But the border,

1323
01:05:11,090 --> 01:05:13,880
the border situation is tangential to 
the real issue.

1324
01:05:14,390 --> 01:05:18,100
And I guess since I'm not an indigenous,
um,

1325
01:05:18,310 --> 01:05:20,950
the way I feel about integration might 
be slightly different,

1326
01:05:21,550 --> 01:05:25,530
but I have a lot of sympathy to 
indigenous indigenous.

1327
01:05:25,800 --> 01:05:26,633
We are seeing that in,
if they feel the sense that the 

1328
01:05:28,361 --> 01:05:30,660
country's been overwhelmed and they have
no control over.

1329
01:05:30,850 --> 01:05:33,970
So I have an appreciation and I 
sympathize with that.

1330
01:05:34,510 --> 01:05:39,510
My biggest problem is that if we do not 
give us control of over the borders,

1331
01:05:40,890 --> 01:05:43,450
it will lead to a situation of social 
tensions.

1332
01:05:43,960 --> 01:05:46,630
And as soon as he's an immigrant and you
know,

1333
01:05:46,660 --> 01:05:50,510
I'm black and I in you don't know.
So,

1334
01:05:51,410 --> 01:05:52,300
so,
um,

1335
01:05:52,810 --> 01:05:57,520
so as someone who is an immigrant,
I feel like if you create so much social

1336
01:05:57,521 --> 01:05:59,840
tension within the system,
it will,

1337
01:05:59,980 --> 01:06:02,290
there'll be a backlash.
And so my,

1338
01:06:02,350 --> 01:06:03,183
my,
my biggest worry about this whole EU 

1339
01:06:05,540 --> 01:06:06,373
controller,
neal,

1340
01:06:06,640 --> 01:06:07,473
that the control the he puts on 
different nations is that it doesn't 

1341
01:06:10,721 --> 01:06:15,300
allow nations to act autonomously so it 
doesn't give them that sort of self will

1342
01:06:15,301 --> 01:06:15,700
to,
to,

1343
01:06:15,700 --> 01:06:16,533
to do things and that leads to 
frustration and that's what we see the 

1344
01:06:19,180 --> 01:06:21,460
rise of the far right and the far left 
in Europe now.

1345
01:06:21,770 --> 01:06:23,150
Yeah.
So I'm curious.

1346
01:06:23,151 --> 01:06:26,570
So as a first generation immigrant,
it's really interesting.

1347
01:06:26,571 --> 01:06:27,404
You're,
you're framing this not only from your 

1348
01:06:28,491 --> 01:06:29,324
perspective,
but you are looking at the people that 

1349
01:06:31,251 --> 01:06:32,084
live there before you and sick saying 
that they have some legitimate fears or 

1350
01:06:36,410 --> 01:06:39,050
maybe some of it's not fully legitimate,
but you're acknowledging it.

1351
01:06:39,260 --> 01:06:40,093
I'm curious,
has some of the sort of regressive 

1352
01:06:42,381 --> 01:06:43,214
ideology has that affected you in that?
I think most people would probably look 

1353
01:06:47,541 --> 01:06:48,374
at you and say that you're black and 
that you're an immigrant and that you 

1354
01:06:50,721 --> 01:06:54,590
should be for fully open borders or some
something along those lines.

1355
01:06:54,830 --> 01:06:56,110
I,
I like to see it.

1356
01:06:56,140 --> 01:06:56,973
He's a fair minded person and I,
I also like to deal with the realities 

1357
01:07:01,161 --> 01:07:02,290
of life.
So back nine,

1358
01:07:02,300 --> 01:07:05,660
Joanne,
I'm from omb in the late eighties we had

1359
01:07:05,690 --> 01:07:06,523
a massive immigration from Ghana,
which is an under a west African nation 

1360
01:07:09,771 --> 01:07:13,640
into Nigeria because they had an 
economic downturn bought that,

1361
01:07:13,641 --> 01:07:17,840
put a little pressure on,
on jobs and services in Nigeria,

1362
01:07:18,260 --> 01:07:20,330
and they became these chants,
you know,

1363
01:07:20,331 --> 01:07:21,020
this,
this,

1364
01:07:21,020 --> 01:07:23,570
this movement called gun on goat.
No,

1365
01:07:24,020 --> 01:07:27,290
that wasn't a,
a sort of a racist movement,

1366
01:07:27,530 --> 01:07:28,363
but in that I could see and appreciate 
that whenever you have a massive influx 

1367
01:07:32,961 --> 01:07:35,000
of immigration open,
showed immigration,

1368
01:07:35,001 --> 01:07:35,834
it's under the place.
It leads to social tensions and you can 

1369
01:07:38,841 --> 01:07:41,570
look at it throughout history and 
throughout everywhere in the world.

1370
01:07:41,870 --> 01:07:44,490
And so we have to do with this bear the 
image.

1371
01:07:44,790 --> 01:07:47,300
I'm pro immigration.
Immigration is good,

1372
01:07:47,520 --> 01:07:50,010
but it has to be controlled.
It has to be sensitive.

1373
01:07:50,011 --> 01:07:53,180
But I mean it has to be at the behest 
and at the will of the people.

1374
01:07:53,600 --> 01:07:55,430
If not,
it's going to lead to trouble.

1375
01:07:55,431 --> 01:07:56,330
And,
and that's,

1376
01:07:56,360 --> 01:07:59,120
that's where I think this discussion 
needs to be,

1377
01:07:59,360 --> 01:08:00,200
to be hard.

1378
01:08:00,460 --> 01:08:01,630
Man.
You're talking to a lot of sense.

1379
01:08:01,631 --> 01:08:02,800
Why aren't you on TV?

1380
01:08:05,200 --> 01:08:05,660
You know,
I,

1381
01:08:05,660 --> 01:08:07,870
I don't speak a lot of pc stuff,
so

1382
01:08:10,450 --> 01:08:11,620
on that,
on that note,

1383
01:08:11,621 --> 01:08:13,660
I'm going to let you go without saying 
anything,

1384
01:08:13,661 --> 01:08:15,740
but I'm going to let you go without 
saying too crazy.

1385
01:08:15,741 --> 01:08:16,100
It was really,

1386
01:08:16,100 --> 01:08:17,720
it was a pleasure talking to you.
All right.

1387
01:08:17,721 --> 01:08:22,721
I am on with Marcello who is in Maine in
the United States via Brazil.

1388
01:08:22,731 --> 01:08:23,564
Am I correct?

1389
01:08:23,850 --> 01:08:24,683
Yes,
you're right.

1390
01:08:24,990 --> 01:08:26,350
I'm from Brazil.

1391
01:08:26,570 --> 01:08:30,890
That is quite a move to go from Brazil.
It's hot and now cold.

1392
01:08:30,920 --> 01:08:32,510
What people are supposed to go the other
way.

1393
01:08:32,511 --> 01:08:32,780
What are you?

1394
01:08:32,780 --> 01:08:34,430
Thank you.
Yeah.

1395
01:08:34,431 --> 01:08:35,264
I actually lived before he,
Connecticut initially when I moved to 

1396
01:08:37,371 --> 01:08:41,180
us.
Then I lived one year in Miami,

1397
01:08:41,630 --> 01:08:42,463
so I kind of experienced them warm back 
and now back in me and it was just 

1398
01:08:45,710 --> 01:08:47,540
mostly for my work.
Right.

1399
01:08:47,680 --> 01:08:49,880
What kind of work do you do?
I'm a physician.

1400
01:08:50,310 --> 01:08:51,061
Right,
right.

1401
01:08:51,061 --> 01:08:51,894
Okay.
We're going to get into a little bit of 

1402
01:08:52,531 --> 01:08:53,670
that.
I knew that actually.

1403
01:08:53,870 --> 01:08:54,271
Uh,
but.

1404
01:08:54,271 --> 01:08:55,104
So one of the things that you wanted to 
discuss with me was how regressive 

1405
01:08:58,711 --> 01:09:03,711
attitudes and this ideology had really 
infected Brazil and how you saw it,

1406
01:09:04,140 --> 01:09:04,973
a change attitudes in Brazil.
So can you tell me a little bit about 

1407
01:09:07,291 --> 01:09:08,090
that?

1408
01:09:08,090 --> 01:09:12,170
Yeah.
Brazil overall is a pretty hardcore left

1409
01:09:12,320 --> 01:09:13,153
leftist country.
The culture in Brazil was taken over by 

1410
01:09:18,561 --> 01:09:23,160
hardcore socialist in the last about 30 
years they took over the church is the,

1411
01:09:23,161 --> 01:09:25,880
the press,
the universities,

1412
01:09:25,970 --> 01:09:27,230
and uh,
they,

1413
01:09:27,320 --> 01:09:31,310
they have this mindset of not wanting to
debate ideas.

1414
01:09:31,790 --> 01:09:35,030
So the way that they see things is that 
if you're not,

1415
01:09:35,090 --> 01:09:38,000
if you don't not agree with them,
then you should shut up.

1416
01:09:38,030 --> 01:09:43,030
You should basically get out of the way.
And this is quite concerning because you

1417
01:09:45,021 --> 01:09:50,021
see people who had these a will to learn
and getting to debate and,

1418
01:09:52,301 --> 01:09:53,134
you know,
and I think that's how country's 

1419
01:09:54,290 --> 01:09:56,090
progress,
how that's how ideas,

1420
01:09:56,330 --> 01:09:57,163
debating ideas.
That's how we get to a Como status to a 

1421
01:10:00,471 --> 01:10:02,370
place for everyone.
And when you can,

1422
01:10:02,380 --> 01:10:03,320
my language,
brother,

1423
01:10:03,610 --> 01:10:04,640
there you go.
Um,

1424
01:10:04,690 --> 01:10:05,523
and,
and that's actually what caught me to 

1425
01:10:06,711 --> 01:10:08,000
your show initially.
Uh,

1426
01:10:08,001 --> 01:10:13,001
this idea of fighting for free speech 
and in Brazil basically the more skilled

1427
01:10:14,870 --> 01:10:15,703
and now in la in the last 10 years I 
would say there's a conservative 

1428
01:10:19,880 --> 01:10:23,900
movement surging so small as to not 
empower,

1429
01:10:23,990 --> 01:10:24,823
but at least there is another way of 
thinking kind of surgery and people are 

1430
01:10:29,511 --> 01:10:32,550
interested,
people are actually looking to it and an

1431
01:10:32,630 --> 01:10:33,271
amazing,
Whoa,

1432
01:10:33,271 --> 01:10:34,700
Whoa,
this exists,

1433
01:10:34,701 --> 01:10:35,180
you know,
like,

1434
01:10:35,180 --> 01:10:36,470
oh,
that makes sense.

1435
01:10:36,720 --> 01:10:40,040
And that's very interesting.
And it's very unfortunately that went in

1436
01:10:40,430 --> 01:10:41,180
that direction.

1437
01:10:41,180 --> 01:10:42,013
So that's really fascinating.
So you're saying basically in the last 

1438
01:10:44,181 --> 01:10:45,014
10 years as a result of this regressive 
ideology taking root that now 

1439
01:10:49,521 --> 01:10:54,020
conservatism is bubbling up and that is 
what is defending free speech.

1440
01:10:54,050 --> 01:10:56,900
It sounds a little backwards for the way
America is,

1441
01:10:57,020 --> 01:10:57,853
although right now I see that happening 
here because strangely it's 

1442
01:11:00,111 --> 01:11:00,944
conservatives that are defending free 
speech and the left that's trying to 

1443
01:11:02,901 --> 01:11:03,734
stifle it.
So it's really everything's kind of 

1444
01:11:05,241 --> 01:11:06,074
upside down.

1445
01:11:06,410 --> 01:11:07,640
No,
I totally agree with you.

1446
01:11:07,700 --> 01:11:08,533
And uh,
I'm not sure if there's a direct effect 

1447
01:11:11,750 --> 01:11:15,070
of that or if it's just,
um,

1448
01:11:15,720 --> 01:11:20,700
people really.
When do you read about new ideas?

1449
01:11:20,730 --> 01:11:23,040
They get interested even if they don't 
agree initially,

1450
01:11:23,220 --> 01:11:25,580
when they have had the freedom to do it.
Um,

1451
01:11:25,780 --> 01:11:27,980
they,
so there are some thinkers,

1452
01:11:27,981 --> 01:11:28,814
some riders in Brazil that 10 years ago 
started writing some stuff and that's 

1453
01:11:32,491 --> 01:11:35,390
when actually I started reading more 
about conservatives,

1454
01:11:35,430 --> 01:11:38,440
more about America,
the free speech ideas,

1455
01:11:38,460 --> 01:11:43,460
the individual rights and the dit of 
you're able to see whatever you want and

1456
01:11:43,840 --> 01:11:47,190
you're fine if you don't like it,
that's fine.

1457
01:11:47,220 --> 01:11:48,360
That's fine.
I like it.

1458
01:11:48,760 --> 01:11:51,720
And there's not the way in Brazil 
before.

1459
01:11:51,820 --> 01:11:55,140
And I saw for example,
journalists actually,

1460
01:11:55,141 --> 01:11:57,060
uh,
having to move away from Brazil in order

1461
01:11:57,061 --> 01:11:59,010
to be able to speak.
And that's that for me.

1462
01:11:59,011 --> 01:12:01,020
It's something unacceptable.
It shouldn't happen.

1463
01:12:01,160 --> 01:12:02,210
Yeah.
I have to say that,

1464
01:12:02,240 --> 01:12:03,980
uh,
until I read your email,

1465
01:12:03,981 --> 01:12:07,940
I really didn't realize how bad things 
had been in Brazil.

1466
01:12:08,170 --> 01:12:09,800
Uh,
so one of the things that you wrote that

1467
01:12:09,801 --> 01:12:10,634
was interesting is that you started 
getting interested in conservative 

1468
01:12:13,550 --> 01:12:16,760
writers and that sort of helped your 
awakening.

1469
01:12:16,761 --> 01:12:17,594
And now you're saying many years later 
these conservative ideas are becoming 

1470
01:12:19,911 --> 01:12:20,744
cool again down there.
Who were some of the writers that you 

1471
01:12:22,101 --> 01:12:22,934
were interested in?

1472
01:12:23,590 --> 01:12:24,423
Well,
initially I started reading proceeding 

1473
01:12:26,711 --> 01:12:29,980
on rikers and one of them was a 
philosopher called Paul offit,

1474
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:32,680
car carvana.
He'd currently lives in Virginia.

1475
01:12:32,710 --> 01:12:36,370
He's well known for,
well known writer in Brazil who actually

1476
01:12:36,371 --> 01:12:37,204
had to move away.
He's one of them and he lives in 

1477
01:12:38,381 --> 01:12:39,370
Virginia.
US.

1478
01:12:39,780 --> 01:12:43,600
Um,
he's a big fighter against communism,

1479
01:12:44,410 --> 01:12:47,710
socialism in Brazil of free speech for 
free speech guy.

1480
01:12:48,310 --> 01:12:49,143
I started reading his stuff.
I then started reading American writers 

1481
01:12:52,151 --> 01:12:53,740
like almost soul,
um,

1482
01:12:54,130 --> 01:12:55,070
um,
uh,

1483
01:12:55,100 --> 01:12:56,550
uh,
Henry House Lit,

1484
01:12:56,810 --> 01:13:00,250
uh,
and this other guys from other countries

1485
01:13:00,251 --> 01:13:03,310
as well and from other Chicago schools 
freedom.

1486
01:13:03,640 --> 01:13:04,473
And more recently I've been reading a 
lot of things that dinesh d'souza 

1487
01:13:08,590 --> 01:13:09,840
rights.
Um,

1488
01:13:10,240 --> 01:13:14,240
so there are few conservatives and they 
usually disguise,

1489
01:13:14,340 --> 01:13:17,950
they defend free speech,
they defend a free exchange of ideas and

1490
01:13:17,951 --> 01:13:20,200
some of them were actually leftist 
before,

1491
01:13:20,201 --> 01:13:24,320
like a David Horowitz as a hardcore left
blackfoot cysts.

1492
01:13:25,000 --> 01:13:29,650
Fomo Saul was a leftist and they,
when he got in contact with the ideas of

1493
01:13:29,651 --> 01:13:32,440
conservative,
they kind of Linda the other direction.

1494
01:13:32,620 --> 01:13:33,453
Yeah.
I've really been doing my best to get 

1495
01:13:34,841 --> 01:13:36,080
Thomas,
so the show,

1496
01:13:36,490 --> 01:13:38,920
I don't know how much public stuff he 
does anymore,

1497
01:13:39,070 --> 01:13:42,340
but I'm working on it.
So stay tuned on that one.

1498
01:13:42,570 --> 01:13:43,780
Um,
so okay,

1499
01:13:43,781 --> 01:13:44,614
so you move up here and you've already 
seen the damage that these ideologies 

1500
01:13:48,910 --> 01:13:49,743
have done in your home country.
So what do you make of what they're 

1501
01:13:52,241 --> 01:13:53,770
doing to America right now?

1502
01:13:54,810 --> 01:13:57,020
It's like seeing a movie again.
Um,

1503
01:13:57,170 --> 01:13:59,250
and,
and it actually changed a lot.

1504
01:13:59,310 --> 01:14:00,960
I feel like it changed a lot in the 
last,

1505
01:14:01,050 --> 01:14:03,210
let's say eight years,
seven years since I moved.

1506
01:14:03,690 --> 01:14:04,523
I'm not sure why,
but I see happening things that I never 

1507
01:14:08,941 --> 01:14:10,950
thought it would be possible here when I
moved to America,

1508
01:14:11,050 --> 01:14:11,900
saw,
you know,

1509
01:14:11,990 --> 01:14:14,680
the universities here are the best 
universities in the world.

1510
01:14:14,710 --> 01:14:18,250
They probably have very free environment
for new ideas,

1511
01:14:18,251 --> 01:14:19,570
for speech,
for debate.

1512
01:14:20,080 --> 01:14:23,830
And then a window you see cases like Ms 
Dot Arvizu,

1513
01:14:23,930 --> 01:14:24,763
uh,
where the professor was saying that's 

1514
01:14:26,881 --> 01:14:30,730
the muscle here to shut off a student,
a student.

1515
01:14:31,180 --> 01:14:34,480
And then you see guys that just to stay 
with guys they're interviewed,

1516
01:14:34,481 --> 01:14:39,481
they're Shapiro mile being like there 
was violence against them and,

1517
01:14:39,810 --> 01:14:41,980
and they cannot even speak any morning 
campuses.

1518
01:14:41,981 --> 01:14:42,814
And your see left is even leftists 
powers one of the journalists who wrote 

1519
01:14:46,061 --> 01:14:47,980
a book about the left shutting up,

1520
01:14:48,260 --> 01:14:49,093
Christina,

1521
01:14:49,250 --> 01:14:52,100
Christina bars.
So even this guys,

1522
01:14:52,130 --> 01:14:53,240
people are.
Wait,

1523
01:14:53,241 --> 01:14:54,260
what is,
this is not cool.

1524
01:14:54,261 --> 01:14:56,150
This is not,
this is not good for anybody.

1525
01:14:57,830 --> 01:15:01,250
So what,
what do you do in your own personal life

1526
01:15:01,251 --> 01:15:03,440
to combat this stuff?
I guess this is the example of the right

1527
01:15:03,441 --> 01:15:05,930
here and you're talking to me so that.
So that's pretty good.

1528
01:15:05,931 --> 01:15:06,764
But really as someone that has seen the 
damage of this and you see this 

1529
01:15:09,501 --> 01:15:10,640
happening now,
is there,

1530
01:15:10,700 --> 01:15:12,250
I mean,
do you post stuff on facebook,

1531
01:15:12,251 --> 01:15:13,084
the uh,
try to get stuff out there to combat 

1532
01:15:14,421 --> 01:15:15,254
some of this?

1533
01:15:15,430 --> 01:15:16,900
Yeah,
I use my facebook a lot.

1534
01:15:17,290 --> 01:15:19,440
I have a lot of American friends.
I have friends.

1535
01:15:19,870 --> 01:15:20,703
I'm very political on facebook and I'm 
glad that I'm still live in a country 

1536
01:15:23,471 --> 01:15:25,840
that is very free,
that I'm not afraid.

1537
01:15:25,870 --> 01:15:26,703
Like I was in Brazil.
People in Brazil are afraid of speaking 

1538
01:15:29,411 --> 01:15:31,240
out things against the government.
For example,

1539
01:15:31,770 --> 01:15:33,340
I'm here.
No,

1540
01:15:33,390 --> 01:15:33,910
I'm,
I'm,

1541
01:15:33,910 --> 01:15:35,050
I,
I feel comfortable.

1542
01:15:35,090 --> 01:15:35,923
So I'm very,
I'm very active in facebook and I 

1543
01:15:37,930 --> 01:15:40,990
usually try to use the experience that I
have in Brazil and,

1544
01:15:41,010 --> 01:15:43,270
you know,
push my American friends so they can see

1545
01:15:44,050 --> 01:15:45,040
the parallel,
you know,

1546
01:15:45,200 --> 01:15:47,760
to try to avoid.
I wouldn't be poor,

1547
01:15:47,761 --> 01:15:49,230
but just the American going directions.

1548
01:15:49,830 --> 01:15:50,663
Do you have American friends that are 
friending you yet and blocking you and 

1549
01:15:53,101 --> 01:15:58,101
all that kind of keep track of them I 
guess.

1550
01:15:58,330 --> 01:16:00,160
I guess in some cases you wouldn't know.
Right.

1551
01:16:01,110 --> 01:16:01,921
Okay.
So the other thing,

1552
01:16:01,921 --> 01:16:03,510
let's move away from politics a little 
bit,

1553
01:16:03,511 --> 01:16:06,270
although everything is political.
So you mentioned that you're a physician

1554
01:16:06,271 --> 01:16:07,104
and one of the things that you want us 
to talk about was the free market and 

1555
01:16:09,710 --> 01:16:10,543
healthcare.
Uh,

1556
01:16:10,710 --> 01:16:14,050
we don't have a ton of time left,
but can you just go with that?

1557
01:16:14,830 --> 01:16:15,663
Um,
yeah.

1558
01:16:16,030 --> 01:16:20,410
Basically just a short thing.
In Brazil we have free healthcare,

1559
01:16:20,470 --> 01:16:21,303
meaning the government takes over 
everything and that's where exactly 

1560
01:16:23,050 --> 01:16:26,140
where I see people dying for lack of 
basic care.

1561
01:16:26,410 --> 01:16:27,243
People waiting in lines for six months 
to get an Mri when they have cancer and 

1562
01:16:29,930 --> 01:16:32,610
a timeline that's very common.
Um,

1563
01:16:33,280 --> 01:16:36,490
and I believe that as anything else in 
life,

1564
01:16:36,730 --> 01:16:39,580
when the free market he's able to share 
work,

1565
01:16:39,880 --> 01:16:40,713
it works better than the government.
So I think in that sense where you're 

1566
01:16:43,451 --> 01:16:46,830
going the wrong direction.
We America has a very good healthcare.

1567
01:16:46,840 --> 01:16:47,673
We have problems that can be solved.
We have to sit down and see what the 

1568
01:16:50,021 --> 01:16:52,000
best policies to get.
Um,

1569
01:16:52,510 --> 01:16:53,343
but I think the fundamental idea is that
we should go towards more free market 

1570
01:16:57,940 --> 01:17:00,190
because competition makes prices go 
down,

1571
01:17:00,220 --> 01:17:02,740
makes things more available services 
more available.

1572
01:17:04,150 --> 01:17:07,040
I wanted a system that gives us iphone,
new TV,

1573
01:17:07,750 --> 01:17:08,583
new cars for cheap.
I don't want a system where she did my 

1574
01:17:11,481 --> 01:17:14,270
healthcare to bureaucrats who spend 
$1,000,000,000

1575
01:17:14,271 --> 01:17:15,950
should make a website that doesn't work.

1576
01:17:16,160 --> 01:17:18,390
Right.
So for you in the,

1577
01:17:18,391 --> 01:17:23,391
in the personal sense as a physician,
how have you seen the healthcare economy

1578
01:17:24,500 --> 01:17:25,333
changing the.
I mean it's obviously changed hugely in 

1579
01:17:26,661 --> 01:17:29,000
the last three years alone.
What have you seen firsthand?

1580
01:17:29,470 --> 01:17:30,303
Well,
I,

1581
01:17:30,340 --> 01:17:32,110
I work in a hospital,
but I hear it,

1582
01:17:32,320 --> 01:17:35,600
I think at the hospital up,
haven't we hadn't had the,

1583
01:17:35,660 --> 01:17:37,630
the,
the hip from obamacare yet,

1584
01:17:37,690 --> 01:17:40,980
but I see a lot of people who work as an
office outside with,

1585
01:17:41,720 --> 01:17:42,760
uh,
outpatient,

1586
01:17:43,110 --> 01:17:43,943
uh,
retiring because they just couldn't 

1587
01:17:44,771 --> 01:17:46,220
handle it anymore.
Um,

1588
01:17:46,540 --> 01:17:47,373
I see a lot of regulations coming in,
increasing the price is because every 

1589
01:17:50,741 --> 01:17:54,280
single regulation,
every single pile of new rules costs.

1590
01:17:54,670 --> 01:17:55,570
Uh,
so when you,

1591
01:17:55,630 --> 01:18:00,630
when you get more government in between 
patients and physicians you have,

1592
01:18:01,560 --> 01:18:06,560
do you have a more cross?
So prices go up and I've even seen this,

1593
01:18:07,350 --> 01:18:08,183
uh,
and we don't have the obamacare fully 

1594
01:18:10,301 --> 01:18:11,134
implemented yet.
I think there are more things to come 

1595
01:18:13,331 --> 01:18:16,240
and then make maybe make things even 
worse.

1596
01:18:17,080 --> 01:18:17,913
Listen,
if I ever need a full frontal lobotomy 

1597
01:18:20,171 --> 01:18:22,150
because of the regressives,
is that something you can do?

1598
01:18:23,320 --> 01:18:26,500
I'm not a neurosurgeon,
but I don't want her to have a lobotomy.

1599
01:18:26,501 --> 01:18:28,200
I think are very good fighter for 
freedom.

1600
01:18:28,360 --> 01:18:29,193
We need you.

1601
01:18:29,240 --> 01:18:30,340
All right,
fair enough.

1602
01:18:30,341 --> 01:18:31,690
Well listen,
it was a pleasure talking to you.

1603
01:18:31,691 --> 01:18:33,520
I wish we had more time,
but we gotta keep going.

1604
01:18:33,950 --> 01:18:34,783
It was my pleasure.
Thank you so much for letting me 

1605
01:18:35,890 --> 01:18:36,850
participate in a show.

1606
01:18:37,000 --> 01:18:39,300
All right.
I'm talking with you from Switzerland.

1607
01:18:39,301 --> 01:18:40,134
Has It gone?

1608
01:18:40,650 --> 01:18:41,680
I'm pretty fine.
Yeah,

1609
01:18:41,690 --> 01:18:44,070
I'm fantastic.
Thanks for having me.

1610
01:18:44,190 --> 01:18:45,023
Good.
That seems like the answer that someone 

1611
01:18:46,171 --> 01:18:48,690
from Switzerland would give.
I'm pretty fantastic.

1612
01:18:48,990 --> 01:18:50,400
People think everything's great over 
there,

1613
01:18:50,401 --> 01:18:51,234
Huh?

1614
01:18:51,690 --> 01:18:54,030
Well,
life is actually pretty great.

1615
01:18:54,031 --> 01:18:54,710
So,
um,

1616
01:18:54,710 --> 01:18:55,543
yeah,
everybody's happy around here and we 

1617
01:18:56,761 --> 01:18:57,594
need to show that.

1618
01:18:57,690 --> 01:18:58,523
Yeah,
no,

1619
01:18:59,070 --> 01:19:00,450
I like hearing that because,
you know,

1620
01:19:00,451 --> 01:19:02,250
we talk about a lot of heavy stuff on 
the show,

1621
01:19:02,251 --> 01:19:04,560
but it's nice to know that things are 
working.

1622
01:19:04,620 --> 01:19:05,453
But one of the things that you mentioned
you wanted to talk about is the dreaded 

1623
01:19:08,581 --> 01:19:13,581
regressive left and how their ideology 
is changing society in Switzerland.

1624
01:19:14,281 --> 01:19:15,114
So go ahead.

1625
01:19:15,630 --> 01:19:16,261
Well,
um,

1626
01:19:16,261 --> 01:19:18,990
the regressive left in Switzerland or 
the equivalent of them.

1627
01:19:18,991 --> 01:19:19,824
Yeah.
They're not really out there in your 

1628
01:19:20,941 --> 01:19:25,941
face like in other countries,
but the actions speak volumes of course,

1629
01:19:26,341 --> 01:19:26,821
you know,
I mean,

1630
01:19:26,821 --> 01:19:29,390
they've always been there,
but um,

1631
01:19:29,550 --> 01:19:31,410
yeah.
And I keep on staring at the party now.

1632
01:19:31,500 --> 01:19:34,920
I mean,
we recently had a case like in the tabby

1633
01:19:34,940 --> 01:19:39,940
that's just around the corner from 
reality in which you don't,

1634
01:19:40,140 --> 01:19:45,140
two boys from a school from Syria with a
very strong religious background refused

1635
01:19:48,240 --> 01:19:50,950
to shake hands with a female teacher.
Yeah,

1636
01:19:50,970 --> 01:19:52,840
yeah.
You heard about that?

1637
01:19:53,040 --> 01:19:54,090
Yeah.
That made news here.

1638
01:19:55,020 --> 01:19:55,920
And uh,
you know,

1639
01:19:55,980 --> 01:19:59,700
the reason behind that was because they 
didn't want to suddenly her dignity's by

1640
01:19:59,701 --> 01:20:00,534
touching her rights.
And this of course all stemmed from the 

1641
01:20:02,941 --> 01:20:05,760
father who is the preaching of a local 
mosque.

1642
01:20:06,320 --> 01:20:07,153
And yeah,
this a stood quite controversy here and 

1643
01:20:09,750 --> 01:20:10,501
um,
you know,

1644
01:20:10,501 --> 01:20:12,060
and of course,
you know,

1645
01:20:12,061 --> 01:20:13,260
the reactions were huge,
you know,

1646
01:20:13,290 --> 01:20:14,123
I mean we had to write shouting,
I'm all the way down that it's not 

1647
01:20:16,621 --> 01:20:17,340
acceptable.

1648
01:20:17,340 --> 01:20:21,500
And the Ivr and you had left.
I'm playing everything down saying like,

1649
01:20:21,501 --> 01:20:22,170
you know,
it's,

1650
01:20:22,170 --> 01:20:23,800
it's just a handshake,
you know,

1651
01:20:23,860 --> 01:20:25,740
if you want to go and do some 
handshakes,

1652
01:20:25,741 --> 01:20:28,690
we can go to the streets and do that.
It's not big of the asshole.

1653
01:20:29,300 --> 01:20:30,133
Most of all.
They all kept on saying it's against 

1654
01:20:31,510 --> 01:20:33,120
loads is fine.
Right.

1655
01:20:33,750 --> 01:20:34,583
But I think what noise people more and 
the reason why they're so passionate 

1656
01:20:39,121 --> 01:20:41,430
about the whole ot was because,
um,

1657
01:20:42,150 --> 01:20:42,983
the decision of the school by just 
tolerating that without actually any 

1658
01:20:45,871 --> 01:20:48,840
article to know,
which is quite an aggressive thing to do

1659
01:20:48,910 --> 01:20:50,420
now.
And uh,

1660
01:20:50,670 --> 01:20:51,503
you know,
um,

1661
01:20:51,510 --> 01:20:52,343
of course concerns were made by the 
people by seeing night and they wanted 

1662
01:20:55,681 --> 01:20:56,514
to start this discussion.
Now it's not particularly about the 

1663
01:20:58,681 --> 01:20:59,514
handshake itself,
which also refused the moderates in our 

1664
01:21:02,431 --> 01:21:07,020
country and they're,
they're just asked themselves stuck.

1665
01:21:07,140 --> 01:21:07,973
They want to start a question though.
Like what is an acceptable into of 

1666
01:21:11,160 --> 01:21:15,030
integration?
What is acceptable in terms of religious

1667
01:21:15,031 --> 01:21:15,864
freedom,
you know,

1668
01:21:16,220 --> 01:21:21,220
and this basic as has been washed out.
But just saying like I'm saying like now

1669
01:21:21,481 --> 01:21:23,070
it's not that big a deal,
you know,

1670
01:21:23,130 --> 01:21:25,470
it's,
and it also interviewed them.

1671
01:21:25,940 --> 01:21:26,773
I'm the head teacher for the school.
And he also kept on saying it's not 

1672
01:21:29,371 --> 01:21:30,204
against the rules and that's about it.
I just don't want to put ourselves out 

1673
01:21:33,421 --> 01:21:34,350
there too much.
You know,

1674
01:21:34,770 --> 01:21:37,200
and this annoyed quite lot of people 
because you know,

1675
01:21:37,230 --> 01:21:40,680
the reason why they feel passionate 
about this whole ordeal was not because,

1676
01:21:40,681 --> 01:21:41,514
you know,
check itself is because the discussion 

1677
01:21:43,740 --> 01:21:46,210
which has never been actually made,
you know,

1678
01:21:46,710 --> 01:21:47,750
this was kind of,
you know,

1679
01:21:47,810 --> 01:21:50,010
a big deal here around.
Yeah.

1680
01:21:50,011 --> 01:21:54,150
So it's not about the actual handshake,
nobody really cares about that,

1681
01:21:54,151 --> 01:21:57,000
but it's just about the creeping idea 
behind it,

1682
01:21:57,390 --> 01:21:58,223
which is that,
that these boys will grow up and not 

1683
01:22:01,260 --> 01:22:02,093
necessarily respect women or treat women
as equals and then that becomes an 

1684
01:22:05,341 --> 01:22:06,710
actual societal problems.

1685
01:22:06,710 --> 01:22:07,543
So it's not about a bunch of young boys 
whether they shake this one person's 

1686
01:22:10,561 --> 01:22:13,880
hand or not.
Well I think it was more about like,

1687
01:22:14,130 --> 01:22:14,963
you know,
what are the ground rules integration 

1688
01:22:16,471 --> 01:22:17,304
here.
We just want to talk about that and we 

1689
01:22:18,811 --> 01:22:19,644
don't actually want to talk too much 
into the future because we don't know 

1690
01:22:21,361 --> 01:22:22,860
what actually would happen.
You know,

1691
01:22:23,230 --> 01:22:25,290
it was just like let's just talk about 
it.

1692
01:22:25,291 --> 01:22:26,124
And at some point it was just not 
possible edible and it didn't end at 

1693
01:22:29,851 --> 01:22:30,720
that point.
Actually,

1694
01:22:30,721 --> 01:22:33,080
I made the pots capitals 30 and instead 
of bringing out,

1695
01:22:33,081 --> 01:22:36,470
and there was another recent case in 
another city Lucerne,

1696
01:22:36,990 --> 01:22:39,210
which is quite a famous this nation in 
Switzerland,

1697
01:22:39,630 --> 01:22:40,463
but it was actually a dentist,
this dentist who fused to operate on 

1698
01:22:43,980 --> 01:22:48,420
patients.
The patient happens to be a Muslim woman

1699
01:22:48,870 --> 01:22:51,840
and she refused to give him a handshake 
because it's,

1700
01:22:52,710 --> 01:22:54,160
it's just a thing she doesn't do.

1701
01:22:55,680 --> 01:22:59,160
He refused to operate on her because he,
his argument was um,

1702
01:22:59,590 --> 01:23:00,423
you know,
I'm a patient doctor relationship is 

1703
01:23:02,641 --> 01:23:04,830
based on trust.
If the trust is not,

1704
01:23:05,360 --> 01:23:06,193
I cannot buy the best wheel and by the 
best capabilities of my conscious I 

1705
01:23:10,061 --> 01:23:11,420
cannot operate on her,
you know,

1706
01:23:11,860 --> 01:23:13,650
although of course that this has,
you know,

1707
01:23:13,760 --> 01:23:14,800
blowing up again,
you know,

1708
01:23:14,801 --> 01:23:15,634
like people asking like,
haven't you made something like the 

1709
01:23:17,291 --> 01:23:20,230
hippocratic oath or something,
you know when you said like,

1710
01:23:20,231 --> 01:23:21,064
yes I did.
But the only challenge with them with 

1711
01:23:23,780 --> 01:23:25,110
emergency status,
you know,

1712
01:23:25,360 --> 01:23:26,020
it's,
it's,

1713
01:23:26,020 --> 01:23:28,690
and,
and she can choose whoever talked to she

1714
01:23:28,691 --> 01:23:29,650
actually wants,
you know,

1715
01:23:30,140 --> 01:23:34,090
it's actually the same thing just in 
opposite positions,

1716
01:23:34,091 --> 01:23:34,924
you know,
I mean,

1717
01:23:35,660 --> 01:23:38,150
it has closed.
It has no feeling,

1718
01:23:38,210 --> 01:23:38,660
you know?

1719
01:23:38,660 --> 01:23:40,520
Right.
So this is like with us,

1720
01:23:40,521 --> 01:23:41,354
you know,
it's like these bakers that don't want 

1721
01:23:43,131 --> 01:23:45,410
to bake a cake for a gay wedding and 
it's like,

1722
01:23:45,411 --> 01:23:46,244
what should the role of the government 
be and should we force people to do all 

1723
01:23:48,801 --> 01:23:50,340
this stuff?
Um,

1724
01:23:50,390 --> 01:23:51,223
so one of the other things that you 
wanted to talk about was the amount of 

1725
01:23:53,331 --> 01:23:56,120
Americans that are moving to 
Switzerland.

1726
01:23:56,121 --> 01:23:56,954
So that's a different type of 
immigration that you have going on 

1727
01:23:58,611 --> 01:23:59,444
there.
Tell me about.

1728
01:23:59,750 --> 01:24:00,583
Yeah,
you can see the other side of the story 

1729
01:24:02,221 --> 01:24:03,030
too.
Yeah.

1730
01:24:03,030 --> 01:24:03,800
I mean,
uh,

1731
01:24:03,800 --> 01:24:07,410
of course the amount of Americans still 
pales in comparison to the EU,

1732
01:24:07,650 --> 01:24:10,500
which the most people immigrated come 
from,

1733
01:24:10,830 --> 01:24:14,700
but they are quite a lot of Americans 
coming here because Switzerland supplies

1734
01:24:14,701 --> 01:24:19,020
about is home to many and major global 
companies.

1735
01:24:19,230 --> 01:24:20,063
And of course eventually they get a 
chance to come my here and then 

1736
01:24:23,611 --> 01:24:24,444
themselves next steps program.
So after someone else they can go back 

1737
01:24:28,680 --> 01:24:29,513
and most of my coworkers actually 
decided to stick around a little bit 

1738
01:24:31,861 --> 01:24:32,694
longer because they learned to 
appreciate the high wages on the 

1739
01:24:36,121 --> 01:24:36,954
security.
And Nice infrastructure to before who 

1740
01:24:40,080 --> 01:24:42,770
I'm optimistic,
positive.

1741
01:24:43,170 --> 01:24:45,630
Of course there are some bad things here
as well.

1742
01:24:45,631 --> 01:24:46,464
And you know,
like the depressive Sunday where 

1743
01:24:48,310 --> 01:24:52,830
everything is closed and the high cost 
of living,

1744
01:24:52,831 --> 01:24:53,664
but usually they like the social 
security network here around and stick 

1745
01:24:57,211 --> 01:24:58,044
around here.

1746
01:24:58,620 --> 01:25:00,390
And uh,
I think is.

1747
01:25:00,391 --> 01:25:02,610
I have to tell you a little story,
sorry about that.

1748
01:25:03,530 --> 01:25:04,610
We're also,
um,

1749
01:25:04,790 --> 01:25:07,560
a household.
We speak a couple of languages,

1750
01:25:07,561 --> 01:25:08,394
right?
And we speak also English and before my 

1751
01:25:10,460 --> 01:25:12,590
tall to enter the kingdom hall.
And she actually,

1752
01:25:12,640 --> 01:25:16,290
we had to fill out the form explaining 
how good the German was actually.

1753
01:25:16,440 --> 01:25:18,810
So the oldest so she can keep up in 
school,

1754
01:25:18,811 --> 01:25:20,560
you know,
I was just actually,

1755
01:25:20,561 --> 01:25:21,231
uh,
yeah,

1756
01:25:21,231 --> 01:25:22,620
it's,
it's a sensible thing to do.

1757
01:25:23,040 --> 01:25:23,873
And now after the signing of the letter 
I received from the Department of 

1758
01:25:26,790 --> 01:25:27,900
Education,
I received a letter,

1759
01:25:27,960 --> 01:25:31,650
an annual let's actually demanding for 
me to organize the German classes.

1760
01:25:32,130 --> 01:25:32,963
And of course I was actually surprised I
was calling up and asking what's the 

1761
01:25:36,991 --> 01:25:37,824
reasoning behind this?
Because I do speak Swiss German pretty 

1762
01:25:39,421 --> 01:25:42,980
well actually.
I'm not bidding cities in consumables.

1763
01:25:43,500 --> 01:25:44,880
And she actually was very surprised.

1764
01:25:44,880 --> 01:25:45,810
He thought like,
Oh yeah,

1765
01:25:45,811 --> 01:25:46,400
you know,
I'm,

1766
01:25:46,400 --> 01:25:47,233
I'm sorry about that.
I mistook it for someone else because 

1767
01:25:49,681 --> 01:25:50,514
you know,
there are some people who have more 

1768
01:25:51,510 --> 01:25:53,150
issues and I've thought about that.
Yeah,

1769
01:25:53,520 --> 01:25:55,290
I my name,
age.

1770
01:25:55,291 --> 01:25:56,124
No,
maybe she thought about Asian people 

1771
01:25:57,211 --> 01:26:01,020
will do actually have some difficulties 
learning switch because it's bad.

1772
01:26:01,470 --> 01:26:02,770
And she told me,
actually no,

1773
01:26:03,830 --> 01:26:07,610
I thought your American,
because I'm American American,

1774
01:26:07,780 --> 01:26:09,740
she told me private,
of course the American,

1775
01:26:09,950 --> 01:26:10,783
a lot of those people have most 
difficulties willing to have most 

1776
01:26:15,411 --> 01:26:19,790
difficulties and to want students with 
German actually because I'm.

1777
01:26:20,060 --> 01:26:22,660
One of the reasons is because they just 
spent just,

1778
01:26:22,700 --> 01:26:23,533
they're just going to be here for five 
years and the oldest is just that 

1779
01:26:26,541 --> 01:26:29,480
reviews are because.
And that's what she said,

1780
01:26:29,500 --> 01:26:30,950
you know,
it's like,

1781
01:26:30,980 --> 01:26:31,520
um,
yeah,

1782
01:26:31,520 --> 01:26:35,300
that's actually no need for us to do 
because you can also speak English.

1783
01:26:35,300 --> 01:26:38,020
But it's actually true.
Most people actually in the,

1784
01:26:38,420 --> 01:26:42,280
in the area to speak English.
It's actually no,

1785
01:26:42,350 --> 01:26:44,450
the reverse thing of the whole thing 
know.

1786
01:26:44,540 --> 01:26:47,390
I mean it's like,
of course not all the Americans.

1787
01:26:47,450 --> 01:26:48,283
I mean,
I have many friends who were Americans 

1788
01:26:49,170 --> 01:26:50,003
this but as a found out and my 
surroundings and stuff quite sensitive 

1789
01:26:54,501 --> 01:26:55,334
because now this whole thing,
interesting and after learning more 

1790
01:27:00,711 --> 01:27:01,544
about this,
I really found out that there's really 

1791
01:27:03,471 --> 01:27:04,304
something,
some with some Americans here and not 

1792
01:27:07,521 --> 01:27:12,521
willingness to assimilating based and 
after asking know,

1793
01:27:12,660 --> 01:27:13,620
um,
um,

1794
01:27:13,760 --> 01:27:16,130
after coding and um,
my uh,

1795
01:27:16,220 --> 01:27:20,350
ex employee who happens to work with the
office of statistics inside like,

1796
01:27:20,360 --> 01:27:21,340
yes,
because you know,

1797
01:27:22,070 --> 01:27:23,960
now something like,
I'm not all of them,

1798
01:27:24,860 --> 01:27:28,130
but some of them have something like a 
special snowflake syndrome,

1799
01:27:28,131 --> 01:27:29,540
you know,
something like that.

1800
01:27:29,870 --> 01:27:30,890
Yeah,
we do it all.

1801
01:27:30,891 --> 01:27:32,270
Well anyway,
you can speak English,

1802
01:27:32,271 --> 01:27:33,320
so why should I know.

1803
01:27:33,410 --> 01:27:34,160
Right.
And that's,

1804
01:27:34,160 --> 01:27:36,700
that's really fascinating because it 
also shows that this,

1805
01:27:36,730 --> 01:27:39,860
all this integration stuff and 
immigration stuff and migrants stuff,

1806
01:27:40,010 --> 01:27:40,843
it's not just about religion,
it's culture because now you're telling 

1807
01:27:43,101 --> 01:27:43,934
me that Americans are coming there.
It's not because of religion that 

1808
01:27:45,921 --> 01:27:46,754
they're not integrating,
but it's partly language only going to 

1809
01:27:48,761 --> 01:27:49,594
be there for five years.
There used to always speaking English 

1810
01:27:51,720 --> 01:27:52,553
listening.
We could go on way longer and I didn't 

1811
01:27:53,661 --> 01:27:54,494
get to handle it.
I didn't get to half the stuff I wanted 

1812
01:27:55,971 --> 01:27:56,804
to talk to you about,
but we got to go so I thank you very 

1813
01:27:58,341 --> 01:27:59,300
much.
All right.

1814
01:27:59,301 --> 01:28:02,200
I'm on with Stefanos from Greece to 
Fido's.

1815
01:28:02,230 --> 01:28:03,063
How's it going?

1816
01:28:04,720 --> 01:28:08,920
It was long.
Like I said previously,

1817
01:28:08,930 --> 01:28:09,763
as long as they have it still money in 
the bank just by the capital controls 

1818
01:28:16,250 --> 01:28:18,590
being implemented.

1819
01:28:19,550 --> 01:28:20,750
Yeah,
I can still live.

1820
01:28:21,350 --> 01:28:22,183
All right.
So that seems like a sort of depressing 

1821
01:28:24,321 --> 01:28:25,154
but good place to start.
So we don't hear much about Greece in 

1822
01:28:27,351 --> 01:28:30,710
the American media,
but you guys are going through a massive

1823
01:28:30,770 --> 01:28:33,560
financial crisis right now.
So I know,

1824
01:28:33,561 --> 01:28:35,690
I know you're not an expert in 
economics,

1825
01:28:35,840 --> 01:28:36,673
but can you sort of lay it out just what
the average person in Greece is going 

1826
01:28:38,811 --> 01:28:39,644
through right now?

1827
01:28:40,470 --> 01:28:45,470
So let's just say that the minimum wage 
here is a 500 euros.

1828
01:28:48,210 --> 01:28:49,043
Okay.
And show me one one coast cold that can 

1829
01:28:52,831 --> 01:28:54,710
live like that.
Just so.

1830
01:28:54,850 --> 01:28:57,840
So to me it's impossible.
You can't do that.

1831
01:28:58,800 --> 01:29:03,360
And I'm again,
say fine,

1832
01:29:03,540 --> 01:29:08,540
it's 500 euros but can't go until he 
stops me slightly less,

1833
01:29:09,810 --> 01:29:14,810
but no thinks memo dot dms that we other
being imposed by miracle and the rest of

1834
01:29:17,071 --> 01:29:17,904
the EU officials and we have to pay like
we have pretty much the taxation of 

1835
01:29:24,541 --> 01:29:28,650
Germany and the wages and benefits of 
Uganda.

1836
01:29:29,060 --> 01:29:30,380
Right.
So basically you guys,

1837
01:29:30,381 --> 01:29:34,190
because of the conditions that the EU 
helped grease out with,

1838
01:29:34,340 --> 01:29:35,173
your taxes are very high and you have a 
lot of people that are getting a lot 

1839
01:29:38,450 --> 01:29:40,460
from the government.
So there's not a lot to go around.

1840
01:29:40,461 --> 01:29:41,780
Is that pretty much fair to say?

1841
01:29:42,650 --> 01:29:43,483
Yeah.
And so it's only the useful to the 

1842
01:29:46,011 --> 01:29:47,250
number one,
eh,

1843
01:29:48,220 --> 01:29:51,590
eh,
the ones responsible for this.

1844
01:29:51,610 --> 01:29:53,660
It might be no,
use my government,

1845
01:29:54,220 --> 01:29:55,053
this,
Theresa and the government that we have 

1846
01:29:57,381 --> 01:30:00,260
right now.
And they're the ones before them.

1847
01:30:00,780 --> 01:30:02,910
New Democracy for example,
if I saw,

1848
01:30:03,000 --> 01:30:05,870
etc.
So they're responsible for this.

1849
01:30:06,210 --> 01:30:07,680
Yeah.
So how do you feel,

1850
01:30:07,681 --> 01:30:08,440
I mean,
in general,

1851
01:30:08,440 --> 01:30:10,770
look,
democracy came from Greece.

1852
01:30:10,771 --> 01:30:11,604
Modern philosophy came from Greece.
Greece has given so much in terms of 

1853
01:30:16,381 --> 01:30:17,214
freedom and free thought to the world.
How do you feel about what's happening 

1854
01:30:21,120 --> 01:30:22,020
in Greece at the moment?

1855
01:30:22,630 --> 01:30:25,060
Yeah.
If only that existed here and it goes,

1856
01:30:25,120 --> 01:30:29,830
it's a big my 16 extinct species by now 
here.

1857
01:30:30,730 --> 01:30:34,080
And the problem here is that,
uh,

1858
01:30:35,240 --> 01:30:38,260
let's see the elections,
the elections,

1859
01:30:38,261 --> 01:30:40,820
you know,
being killed by a gold,

1860
01:30:41,110 --> 01:30:46,110
gold singular logic that works with the 
government to count all the votes,

1861
01:30:46,950 --> 01:30:47,783
etc.
So at the surface it's all fine and 

1862
01:30:52,061 --> 01:30:55,820
dandy until you get to realize that,
uh,

1863
01:30:55,870 --> 01:31:00,000
this company,
it belongs to the old sites.

1864
01:31:00,960 --> 01:31:01,631
No,
the ones,

1865
01:31:01,631 --> 01:31:04,540
the big bad bankers,
which be honest,

1866
01:31:04,541 --> 01:31:05,374
a Canada and there are,
I think behind the scenes of all this 

1867
01:31:10,150 --> 01:31:10,983
nonsense.

1868
01:31:11,330 --> 01:31:12,163
Right?
So You guys are sort of caught between 

1869
01:31:13,131 --> 01:31:16,610
the european union and the bankers that 
are kind of funding the election,

1870
01:31:16,611 --> 01:31:17,410
sort of.
Yeah.

1871
01:31:17,410 --> 01:31:19,420
They're the oneS benefiting from this 
crisis.

1872
01:31:19,660 --> 01:31:20,140
Yeah.
All right,

1873
01:31:20,140 --> 01:31:21,040
well let's,
let's get away.

1874
01:31:21,100 --> 01:31:21,933
Let's get away from politics for a 
minute because it obviously can be a 

1875
01:31:24,490 --> 01:31:25,730
pretty sobering.
Uh,

1876
01:31:25,750 --> 01:31:28,140
one of the things you wanted to talk to 
me about was gamergate,

1877
01:31:28,150 --> 01:31:30,970
which a lot of people jumped on the 
gamer gate idea.

1878
01:31:31,960 --> 01:31:34,630
Anything specific on gamer gate or how 
did you get involved in it?

1879
01:31:34,631 --> 01:31:35,980
Were you in it from the beginning

1880
01:31:37,010 --> 01:31:37,843
and once you've moved in?
The moment I heard about this story of 

1881
01:31:42,670 --> 01:31:46,570
having sex with one of the,
the eh,

1882
01:31:46,590 --> 01:31:51,300
the journalist in goto when he posted 
there,

1883
01:31:51,301 --> 01:31:56,301
If you have a quest,
if I'm right that game.

1884
01:31:57,160 --> 01:32:01,860
So it is obvious that the,
oh,

1885
01:32:01,880 --> 01:32:06,880
this gaming journalism websites I got up
and they all have these feminists.

1886
01:32:10,200 --> 01:32:15,200
Dsa was in all these people defend this.
Like why defend this?

1887
01:32:17,130 --> 01:32:17,963
The,
they don't care about gamers don't get 

1888
01:32:19,691 --> 01:32:20,450
up us.

1889
01:32:20,450 --> 01:32:21,283
So that,
that's why I was so interested in gamer 

1890
01:32:22,821 --> 01:32:24,280
gate.
Even before I,

1891
01:32:24,281 --> 01:32:25,114
you know,
I used to be a gamer like in the 

1892
01:32:27,290 --> 01:32:28,123
eighties and nineties and now like I 
love the culture around video games but 

1893
01:32:30,681 --> 01:32:31,514
I don't play that much.
But I thought the whole thing was 

1894
01:32:33,081 --> 01:32:33,914
fascinating because you guys were 
dealing with so much of the stuff that 

1895
01:32:36,711 --> 01:32:38,090
we talk about now.
The gamers,

1896
01:32:38,091 --> 01:32:40,640
we're dealing with all the social 
justice warrior stuff,

1897
01:32:40,670 --> 01:32:43,100
all the collusion between,
you know,

1898
01:32:43,101 --> 01:32:48,101
creators and the publishers and all of 
that and feminism and,

1899
01:32:48,190 --> 01:32:49,023
and all of this stuff.
And that sort of seeped up into society 

1900
01:32:51,951 --> 01:32:52,784
which is a good transition for you.
Also wanted to talk about cultural 

1901
01:32:55,611 --> 01:32:58,220
marxism and I think that's very much 
related.

1902
01:32:58,221 --> 01:32:59,054
So how has cultural marxism,
the ideas of it taking root in Greece 

1903
01:33:02,271 --> 01:33:03,104
right now?

1904
01:33:04,740 --> 01:33:05,573
Good.
Say that pretty much invented eh 

1905
01:33:10,460 --> 01:33:11,293
cultural marxism really throuGh the fact
that we have like series a and next 

1906
01:33:17,591 --> 01:33:20,080
thing,
those are the parties under a.

1907
01:33:20,081 --> 01:33:23,390
Yeah,
which is not doing parliament right now.

1908
01:33:23,391 --> 01:33:28,391
They get like one percent of the vote or
soMething and the radicals and there was

1909
01:33:29,601 --> 01:33:34,601
also also known as the socialist which 
uh,

1910
01:33:35,930 --> 01:33:40,250
was responsible for the grants that we 
live right now.

1911
01:33:40,251 --> 01:33:44,840
Like they were promising to people 
things that on the surface are needed,

1912
01:33:44,841 --> 01:33:45,674
like high wages,
a pensions benefits and all that good 

1913
01:33:49,401 --> 01:33:52,100
stuff.
But what they do,

1914
01:33:52,610 --> 01:33:53,443
well they did,
let's say during the eighties they 

1915
01:33:56,840 --> 01:34:00,710
tripled that way.
So that's fine.

1916
01:34:00,711 --> 01:34:05,711
But they did well not acknowledging that
you to do that,

1917
01:34:06,680 --> 01:34:10,130
you have to take some counter measures 
as well,

1918
01:34:10,131 --> 01:34:10,964
like you have to decrease a taxation for
the company so that they can pay their 

1919
01:34:15,681 --> 01:34:18,110
employees and they didn't do that.

1920
01:34:18,170 --> 01:34:21,800
And as a result,
a lot of interest industries that we had

1921
01:34:21,801 --> 01:34:22,634
back then,
like,

1922
01:34:23,130 --> 01:34:25,000
uh,
uh,

1923
01:34:25,830 --> 01:34:28,460
we used to have great bosses,
for example,

1924
01:34:28,461 --> 01:34:33,461
we had that car industry small but still
relevant at the time.

1925
01:34:34,280 --> 01:34:35,113
And as a result,
they all closed down in the situation 

1926
01:34:38,241 --> 01:34:41,600
was Getting worse and worse.
And now that wayne,

1927
01:34:41,660 --> 01:34:42,493
we eh carbon to be in the eu and despite
the things that were being told by the 

1928
01:34:48,291 --> 01:34:49,124
media that oh my god,
the u is our home and if we live will 

1929
01:34:52,011 --> 01:34:54,870
turn into North Korea.
It's fuckinG laughable.

1930
01:34:54,871 --> 01:34:57,560
And how am I supposed to take you 
seriously after this?

1931
01:34:58,070 --> 01:35:02,640
So basically the problems that we have,
a pretty much,

1932
01:35:02,680 --> 01:35:04,010
eh,
eh,

1933
01:35:04,730 --> 01:35:05,563
have gone plus 10 right at the moment.
We joined the eu and the eurozone in 

1934
01:35:11,180 --> 01:35:12,500
2001.
I think.

1935
01:35:13,720 --> 01:35:14,850
So when,
uh,

1936
01:35:14,851 --> 01:35:16,540
uh,
I guess it was about a year ago when the

1937
01:35:16,570 --> 01:35:17,403
financial crisis seemed to be at its 
worst right before the eu came in and 

1938
01:35:20,261 --> 01:35:21,094
bailed out again.
But you're saying this is a pretty 

1939
01:35:22,421 --> 01:35:24,550
crappy situation,
but what was it like,

1940
01:35:24,700 --> 01:35:27,610
like when you couldn't go to the atm and
get money out,

1941
01:35:27,611 --> 01:35:31,240
didn't they stop money coming up?
Like what did that feel like for you and

1942
01:35:31,241 --> 01:35:34,720
for your family when it feels like the 
system is collapsing?

1943
01:35:36,780 --> 01:35:37,613
It's difficult.
They found the fact that you have to 

1944
01:35:39,821 --> 01:35:44,821
take only 60 euros per day.
The atm and yeah,

1945
01:35:47,170 --> 01:35:49,830
we kind of have to adjust that.

1946
01:35:50,810 --> 01:35:51,361
All right.
Listen,

1947
01:35:51,361 --> 01:35:52,980
we could talk about so much.
We went,

1948
01:35:53,010 --> 01:35:54,420
we went pretty heavy here.
Listen,

1949
01:35:54,421 --> 01:35:56,730
where's the best place for Slovakia in 
athens?

1950
01:35:57,750 --> 01:35:58,583
Uh,
there are several restaurants we didn't 

1951
01:36:00,761 --> 01:36:02,710
get by gyros,
know that,

1952
01:36:02,740 --> 01:36:03,573
but uh,
I can really tell it's entirely up to 

1953
01:36:06,841 --> 01:36:09,580
you.
But one warning,

1954
01:36:10,140 --> 01:36:14,770
if you see that kind of like a lot of 
olive oil avoided,

1955
01:36:14,990 --> 01:36:17,420
stay away from the gyros with a lot of 
olive oil.

1956
01:36:17,480 --> 01:36:18,160
All right,
well

1957
01:36:18,160 --> 01:36:18,993
no,
they,

1958
01:36:19,380 --> 01:36:21,670
they're not really that they said at 
least to me.

1959
01:36:22,250 --> 01:36:23,280
fair enough.
Alright.

1960
01:36:23,320 --> 01:36:24,770
It's about us.
It was a pleasure talking to you.

1961
01:36:24,771 --> 01:36:25,940
Thanks man.
All right.

1962
01:36:25,941 --> 01:36:26,774
I am on with joe from Egypt.
Can I call you joe or should I call you 

1963
01:36:30,111 --> 01:36:31,280
the last pharaoh?

1964
01:36:31,960 --> 01:36:33,000
Yeah,
fine.

1965
01:36:33,360 --> 01:36:35,070
Joseph.
Joe is fine.

1966
01:36:35,700 --> 01:36:37,300
Let's try it.
Wouldn't be like a bit awkward.

1967
01:36:37,301 --> 01:36:37,700
So

1968
01:36:37,700 --> 01:36:39,530
yeah.
All right.

1969
01:36:39,531 --> 01:36:40,364
So for people that don't know you,
you're the only person we selected out 

1970
01:36:42,681 --> 01:36:43,514
of the 20 people that I actually do know
of because I follow you on twitter and 

1971
01:36:46,761 --> 01:36:47,594
you are a youtube or by the name of the 
last pharaoh and you do really some 

1972
01:36:51,651 --> 01:36:52,484
great videos talking about atheism and 
secularism and being an ex muslim and 

1973
01:36:57,021 --> 01:36:59,810
the regressive left.
All of this stuff.

1974
01:37:00,160 --> 01:37:01,700
Uh,
but before we get into that,

1975
01:37:01,970 --> 01:37:05,420
tell me your 31 in Egypt.
how is life in Egypt these days?

1976
01:37:06,730 --> 01:37:08,800
Well,
it's kind of okay.

1977
01:37:08,801 --> 01:37:12,490
I mean by look out when I,
when people ask me that question,

1978
01:37:12,491 --> 01:37:13,324
I always like to think you'd like to 
give myself some hope to say at least 

1979
01:37:16,331 --> 01:37:18,460
I'm not living in Afghanistan or Saudi 
Arabia.

1980
01:37:19,290 --> 01:37:21,790
So you're not just,
yeah,

1981
01:37:21,791 --> 01:37:23,260
just be able to,
you know,

1982
01:37:23,290 --> 01:37:27,160
to function and actually like on a day 
to day basis,

1983
01:37:27,161 --> 01:37:30,830
I really don't feel like that much of 
it,

1984
01:37:30,850 --> 01:37:34,870
just like for other people,
other people are getting like bad,

1985
01:37:34,871 --> 01:37:37,990
but for me I maybe because I just have 
thick skin or something,

1986
01:37:37,991 --> 01:37:40,330
I don't know,
I'm not really feeling that affected.

1987
01:37:40,780 --> 01:37:41,740
So yeaH.

1988
01:37:42,600 --> 01:37:43,433
So we don't have to go too much into the
politics because I want to really focus 

1989
01:37:46,021 --> 01:37:47,370
on what you're doing.
But you know,

1990
01:37:47,371 --> 01:37:48,181
he was only,
what,

1991
01:37:48,181 --> 01:37:49,014
three,
four years ago that the arab spring 

1992
01:37:51,421 --> 01:37:56,100
happened and you guys lived under 
mubarak who was basically a dictator for

1993
01:37:56,101 --> 01:37:56,934
30 something years.
You then you had the muslim brotherhood 

1994
01:37:59,281 --> 01:38:01,620
by,
by democratic elections for a year.

1995
01:38:01,830 --> 01:38:04,710
Then they get overthrown by the military
again.

1996
01:38:04,711 --> 01:38:06,710
And that's where you're at now.
Um,

1997
01:38:06,740 --> 01:38:08,430
yeah.
So two people there.

1998
01:38:08,431 --> 01:38:09,264
What,
how do they feel just about the whole 

1999
01:38:10,771 --> 01:38:11,604
system?
Is there a feeling that democracy is 

2000
01:38:13,051 --> 01:38:13,884
ever going to come back?
Do they want democracy to come back 

2001
01:38:15,780 --> 01:38:17,490
because it didn't really work for that 
year.

2002
01:38:17,491 --> 01:38:19,500
Like what's the feelinG there?
Well,

2003
01:38:19,520 --> 01:38:19,850
yeah,

2004
01:38:19,850 --> 01:38:23,360
to like differentiate between like two,
like glasses with people.

2005
01:38:23,361 --> 01:38:25,880
So we have like that majority of 
egyptians,

2006
01:38:25,881 --> 01:38:29,050
like their normal everyday,
like dental people do.

2007
01:38:29,150 --> 01:38:31,360
I would say they're like,
I don't,

2008
01:38:31,380 --> 01:38:34,520
I'm not happy right now as,
as they should,

2009
01:38:34,570 --> 01:38:35,403
but they're like kind of okay with it.
Like what would look with the current 

2010
01:38:38,840 --> 01:38:39,673
government,
they were not happy during the muslim 

2011
01:38:41,361 --> 01:38:42,194
brotherhood even more,
even less happy than deal with under 

2012
01:38:43,911 --> 01:38:44,930
mubarak.
So that,

2013
01:38:44,931 --> 01:38:45,764
that was like,
that was gonna work at all that the 

2014
01:38:48,231 --> 01:38:52,460
whole thing.
So bonked the political class in Egypt,

2015
01:38:52,461 --> 01:38:55,190
which I happen to just saying that like 
90 percent of them are idiots,

2016
01:38:55,640 --> 01:38:57,230
but uh,
yeah,

2017
01:38:57,231 --> 01:39:00,530
they're not happy with anything which I 
think is,

2018
01:39:00,800 --> 01:39:01,633
do you have like this like kind of like 
aggressive his jaw kind of a thing 

2019
01:39:05,481 --> 01:39:09,020
happening like all the time and they're 
not focusing on what's important.

2020
01:39:09,020 --> 01:39:11,300
So they're just make big deals about 
nothing.

2021
01:39:11,780 --> 01:39:12,613
While it will not talking about people 
going to jail for just saying like 

2022
01:39:16,791 --> 01:39:19,610
normal,
like just stupid shit.

2023
01:39:19,990 --> 01:39:20,823
The sick people are going to jail for 
making jokes about feeling like balloon 

2024
01:39:24,840 --> 01:39:29,840
balloon condoms with air and handed them
out so they just send them to prison.

2025
01:39:30,290 --> 01:39:32,070
Some people just went to prison because 
of the glue,

2026
01:39:32,071 --> 01:39:34,010
like sketch comedy on youtube or 
something.

2027
01:39:34,040 --> 01:39:34,873
They sent them to prison.
So I think the most important thing 

2028
01:39:36,981 --> 01:39:38,330
that,
that needs to change in Egypt,

2029
01:39:38,331 --> 01:39:41,720
not another gene,
not the economy economy,

2030
01:39:41,760 --> 01:39:44,690
and they're just doing what they can.
I mean the government,

2031
01:39:45,020 --> 01:39:45,680
they,
they,

2032
01:39:45,680 --> 01:39:46,370
they have,
uh,

2033
01:39:46,370 --> 01:39:50,150
they have an interest to just do as bit 
as best as they can.

2034
01:39:50,420 --> 01:39:54,680
What I really think is important is the 
whole free speech and like the blasphemy

2035
01:39:54,681 --> 01:39:55,514
law,
the,

2036
01:39:55,600 --> 01:39:56,433
that

2037
01:39:56,440 --> 01:39:57,273
modesty laws,
these kinds of loads need to go because 

2038
01:39:59,651 --> 01:40:01,510
the constitution actually doesn't allow 
it.

2039
01:40:01,920 --> 01:40:05,000
Some people should just focus on that,
uh,

2040
01:40:05,170 --> 01:40:06,003
raising the money getting goes,
like laws in front of the parliament or 

2041
01:40:08,561 --> 01:40:10,030
in front of even the constitutional 
court.

2042
01:40:10,150 --> 01:40:13,870
Because the egyptian constitution,
if you read it and forget it from Egypt,

2043
01:40:14,260 --> 01:40:15,093
you really want to know that it's for me
because it's like 99 point nine percent 

2044
01:40:18,371 --> 01:40:19,204
secular,
like really freedom of speech like has 

2045
01:40:21,251 --> 01:40:23,650
its own article that's like totally 
guaranteed,

2046
01:40:23,651 --> 01:40:26,470
no restrictions moment in invitations 
under any circumstances.

2047
01:40:26,590 --> 01:40:27,423
So the fact that we have laws punishing 
people because the insulted this guy or 

2048
01:40:31,901 --> 01:40:35,380
the president or like some.
I don't know anyone,

2049
01:40:35,800 --> 01:40:38,620
it's unconstitutional.
It's like 100 percent unconstitutional.

2050
01:40:38,621 --> 01:40:40,150
Yeah.
So with all that in mind,

2051
01:40:40,151 --> 01:40:40,984
I mean,
where do you get the balls to do what 

2052
01:40:43,181 --> 01:40:45,100
you do?
You're showing me your face right now.

2053
01:40:45,101 --> 01:40:45,934
I asked you before we started recording 
if it was okay if we wanted to do 

2054
01:40:48,371 --> 01:40:50,890
something different or whatever,
wear a mask or whatever,

2055
01:40:51,040 --> 01:40:52,840
but I mean you'd put your videos out 
there with your.

2056
01:40:53,290 --> 01:40:54,123
You're,
you're incredibly brave and clear and 

2057
01:40:55,991 --> 01:40:56,824
honest.
I mean,

2058
01:40:57,790 --> 01:40:59,120
okay.
Just I don't see.

2059
01:40:59,910 --> 01:41:01,070
Oh okay.
that's better.

2060
01:41:01,870 --> 01:41:02,770
Yeah.
I don't see it like that.

2061
01:41:02,771 --> 01:41:03,604
I just see it.
Like I said that before to a lot of 

2062
01:41:06,071 --> 01:41:10,980
people are not doing the videos 
anonymously to hide it.

2063
01:41:10,981 --> 01:41:12,430
Just like my,
you know,

2064
01:41:12,550 --> 01:41:16,780
my privacy kind of that I don't like 
putting my face on camera all the time.

2065
01:41:16,890 --> 01:41:19,120
Yeah.
But I mean if I was living in America or

2066
01:41:19,121 --> 01:41:21,220
something,
I would still do the videos anonymously.

2067
01:41:21,670 --> 01:41:25,240
People seem to miss that point.
I said that all that I'm not hiding.

2068
01:41:25,270 --> 01:41:27,150
I just don't like putting my face on 
camera.

2069
01:41:27,190 --> 01:41:29,920
I just don't like seeing myself on 
camera.

2070
01:41:30,310 --> 01:41:31,410
So that's it.
I'm not.

2071
01:41:31,790 --> 01:41:35,140
And to me it's like I dunno,
it's like I'm tired.

2072
01:41:35,200 --> 01:41:37,180
I'm like city one,
but I feel like I'm 60.

2073
01:41:37,181 --> 01:41:39,940
I'm thought I'm not going to hide it.
I'm not going to censor myself anymore.

2074
01:41:39,940 --> 01:41:40,773
It's just like people seem to forget 
that on a day to day basis I have to 

2075
01:41:44,351 --> 01:41:48,400
pretend to be someone else,
like everyone around me.

2076
01:41:49,810 --> 01:41:50,643
Even when I'm getting ahead,
god I have to like agree with the guy 

2077
01:41:53,100 --> 01:41:53,933
was cutting my hair that dealt with or 
we have like a particularly hot summer 

2078
01:41:57,420 --> 01:42:00,500
these days that the weather is like a 
last thing and,

2079
01:42:00,510 --> 01:42:01,343
and you know,
we have to be thankful because some 

2080
01:42:02,561 --> 01:42:05,140
people got it worse.
So I have to agree with that.

2081
01:42:05,170 --> 01:42:07,750
Like every single minute of every single
day.

2082
01:42:07,870 --> 01:42:09,520
So I'm not going to censor myself 
online.

2083
01:42:09,521 --> 01:42:10,180
That's like,

2084
01:42:10,180 --> 01:42:11,630
was going to happen.
So you have to,

2085
01:42:11,660 --> 01:42:12,493
you have to thank all of that.
It's really hot but not hot or that 

2086
01:42:14,811 --> 01:42:15,644
really hot.

2087
01:42:16,090 --> 01:42:16,541
Yeah.
Yeah.

2088
01:42:16,541 --> 01:42:17,374
So basically in every muslim country is 
you have to be thankful because you're 

2089
01:42:22,000 --> 01:42:22,833
not like the worst thing on earth.
So as long as there's one guy that's 

2090
01:42:27,401 --> 01:42:29,500
worse than you,
you have to be thankful.

2091
01:42:29,770 --> 01:42:31,990
Oh,
that guy.

2092
01:42:31,991 --> 01:42:34,480
And that guy should like,
have a problem with god.

2093
01:42:34,481 --> 01:42:35,280
Seriously.

2094
01:42:35,280 --> 01:42:37,200
It can always,
we can always get worse.

2095
01:42:37,201 --> 01:42:37,920
I get it.
Alright.

2096
01:42:37,920 --> 01:42:40,110
So I want to talk a little bit about 
your personal stuff.

2097
01:42:40,320 --> 01:42:43,500
So you are an atheist and you consider 
yourself an ex muslim,

2098
01:42:43,501 --> 01:42:45,000
correct?
Yeah.

2099
01:42:45,110 --> 01:42:47,790
So you put these videos out there and 
you have,

2100
01:42:47,820 --> 01:42:49,530
you have a real fan base.
It's awesome.

2101
01:42:49,790 --> 01:42:51,660
Uh,
what about in your own personal life?

2102
01:42:51,661 --> 01:42:52,920
They're like,
are you,

2103
01:42:52,921 --> 01:42:53,754
are you out to your friends and family?
Like how much can you talk about that 

2104
01:42:56,971 --> 01:42:57,804
stuff?

2105
01:42:57,880 --> 01:42:58,990
Well,
look,

2106
01:42:58,991 --> 01:43:03,370
my friends and family,
like they know I'm not like religious.

2107
01:43:03,490 --> 01:43:06,880
That's what they know.
And they know that I'm kind of like,

2108
01:43:07,780 --> 01:43:08,613
you know,
I,

2109
01:43:08,630 --> 01:43:11,920
I just don't care about any annual that 
they know that,

2110
01:43:12,220 --> 01:43:16,010
but they don't know that I'm like a 
hundred percent atheist.

2111
01:43:16,090 --> 01:43:16,923
Actually,
the idea wouldn't even enter their 

2112
01:43:18,131 --> 01:43:21,130
minds.
Even if I told them they would be like,

2113
01:43:22,240 --> 01:43:23,390
you know,
there's not,

2114
01:43:23,740 --> 01:43:26,710
the mind wouldn't be like cut because 
the option's not on the table.

2115
01:43:26,711 --> 01:43:28,660
He didn't like Egypt during the muslim 
countries.

2116
01:43:28,870 --> 01:43:31,990
It's not an option to be an atheist.
No one knew that.

2117
01:43:32,020 --> 01:43:32,853
No one told me that.
So if someone would have told me that 

2118
01:43:35,021 --> 01:43:39,250
when I was six years old because I 
always wasn't compliant with religion.

2119
01:43:39,460 --> 01:43:42,280
So if someone would've told me that,
like when I was young,

2120
01:43:42,590 --> 01:43:43,423
the idea I'm,
I might've made the switch a long time 

2121
01:43:46,361 --> 01:43:48,370
ago,
but the idea wasn't even there.

2122
01:43:48,430 --> 01:43:50,530
So when did you make that switch?
When did you wake up?

2123
01:43:51,270 --> 01:43:52,103
Uh,
I think it was about three years ago at 

2124
01:43:53,450 --> 01:43:55,100
some,
like a,

2125
01:43:55,350 --> 01:43:56,183
you know,
like I had like a major event happened 

2126
01:43:59,031 --> 01:44:01,970
in my life.
So I had to stop because I was just gone

2127
01:44:02,330 --> 01:44:03,163
and I wasn't really paying attention.
but I never really was a muslim if you 

2128
01:44:06,481 --> 01:44:07,314
really like

2129
01:44:08,800 --> 01:44:10,180
considered it a like what,
what,

2130
01:44:10,210 --> 01:44:12,460
how I was living.
I never really was.

2131
01:44:12,590 --> 01:44:15,040
I didn't even stop to think,
you know what,

2132
01:44:15,041 --> 01:44:17,800
maybe this is all bullshit.
I never stopped to say that to myself,

2133
01:44:18,040 --> 01:44:21,790
but when my life just stopped me,
like forcefully stop.

2134
01:44:22,560 --> 01:44:23,393
I hAd,
I had some time to like reflect and 

2135
01:44:25,181 --> 01:44:28,300
think and just reach a conclusion that 
it was just like right there.

2136
01:44:28,301 --> 01:44:30,010
But they never really even considered 
it.

2137
01:44:30,250 --> 01:44:31,083
Yeah.
And did you jump on youtube right after 

2138
01:44:32,381 --> 01:44:33,214
that?
Because the stuff that you do there is 

2139
01:44:33,971 --> 01:44:34,804
really great.
And we'll put a link below so everyone 

2140
01:44:36,191 --> 01:44:38,260
can find it.
This is it though,

2141
01:44:38,280 --> 01:44:39,900
isn't great.
I don't think it.

2142
01:44:41,140 --> 01:44:42,770
Yeah.
But I,

2143
01:44:42,771 --> 01:44:44,920
I think you're brave for having me.
Actually.

2144
01:44:45,130 --> 01:44:47,040
I'm brave.
I think you're backwards.

2145
01:44:47,780 --> 01:44:48,160
No,
no,

2146
01:44:48,160 --> 01:44:48,993
no.
Because like my videos are not like 

2147
01:44:50,410 --> 01:44:55,110
advertiser friendly or something.
They don't really follow like cold,

2148
01:44:55,170 --> 01:44:55,710
like.

2149
01:44:55,710 --> 01:44:56,950
Yeah.
So.

2150
01:44:57,130 --> 01:44:58,200
So yeah,
I know.

2151
01:44:58,210 --> 01:45:03,210
What actually made me jump from unt was,
I know it's like a cliche at this point,

2152
01:45:04,180 --> 01:45:06,070
but actually it was the sam harris ben 
affleck.

2153
01:45:06,080 --> 01:45:07,310
Think,
I mean,

2154
01:45:07,330 --> 01:45:09,100
it was like,
that was my awakening too,

2155
01:45:09,101 --> 01:45:11,380
so we're across the world.
Yeah.

2156
01:45:11,381 --> 01:45:12,910
It was like,
no,

2157
01:45:12,911 --> 01:45:13,540
no,
no,

2158
01:45:13,540 --> 01:45:13,841
no,
no,

2159
01:45:13,841 --> 01:45:15,130
no.
Someone needs like,

2160
01:45:15,610 --> 01:45:18,250
someone needs to have this guy's back 
because he's like,

2161
01:45:18,490 --> 01:45:23,200
he's like taking old heat,
has seen something that's so obvious and

2162
01:45:23,201 --> 01:45:24,034
it's like ridiculous where people.
And actually not just the interview the 

2163
01:45:28,090 --> 01:45:31,150
next day when cnn and all that,
that was like a shit show.

2164
01:45:31,390 --> 01:45:34,240
It was like,
can I say that?

2165
01:45:34,330 --> 01:45:35,680
You can say it,
go crazy.

2166
01:45:35,681 --> 01:45:37,720
You can say more than that can shit 
show.

2167
01:45:37,810 --> 01:45:38,800
So yeah.
Uh,

2168
01:45:38,950 --> 01:45:40,480
yeah,
I had to like say something.

2169
01:45:40,910 --> 01:45:43,480
I actually uploaded two videos and 
deleted them,

2170
01:45:44,990 --> 01:45:45,823
but then I uploaded the third one 
because I wasn't really sure about the 

2171
01:45:48,291 --> 01:45:50,240
other thing.
I was like,

2172
01:45:50,241 --> 01:45:52,700
okay,
if I get like 100 years on that,

2173
01:45:52,880 --> 01:45:53,713
okay,
I'll do a second one a and it just kept 

2174
01:45:56,691 --> 01:45:58,730
going from there.
Think how awesome that is really.

2175
01:45:58,731 --> 01:46:00,950
I mean we live something like,
I don't know,

2176
01:46:00,980 --> 01:46:01,813
8,000
miles away from each other and that 

2177
01:46:03,471 --> 01:46:05,030
moment,
that same night,

2178
01:46:05,330 --> 01:46:07,630
I mean that was my awakening.
I had had a little,

2179
01:46:07,830 --> 01:46:11,400
a little crack in my awakening before 
that and,

2180
01:46:11,490 --> 01:46:13,100
and,
but we had that together that,

2181
01:46:13,101 --> 01:46:15,410
that is so cool.
So I'm thrilled to be talking to you.

2182
01:46:15,650 --> 01:46:16,483
Um,
but I,

2183
01:46:17,210 --> 01:46:18,520
I go ahead.
No,

2184
01:46:18,580 --> 01:46:19,413
no,
go ahead.

2185
01:46:20,060 --> 01:46:20,893
You're a good host to a so we only have,
we only have like another minute but 

2186
01:46:23,661 --> 01:46:26,090
I'll do something else with you in the 
future.

2187
01:46:26,091 --> 01:46:26,924
But uh,
just talk to me a little bit about the 

2188
01:46:28,281 --> 01:46:30,820
regressives because you hate them as 
much as I do this,

2189
01:46:30,821 --> 01:46:32,030
this regressive ideology.

2190
01:46:32,120 --> 01:46:32,953
So how does it affect you as a free 
thinker and a secularist and an atheist 

2191
01:46:36,411 --> 01:46:39,230
in Egypt?
How does their ideology harm you?

2192
01:46:39,260 --> 01:46:41,810
Your ability to live the way you want?
Well,

2193
01:46:41,811 --> 01:46:42,644
the basically shutting down any 
conversation that could bleed to 

2194
01:46:45,291 --> 01:46:48,190
anything because when you're talking 
about like that.

2195
01:46:48,920 --> 01:46:49,753
Yeah,
that,

2196
01:46:49,900 --> 01:46:50,580
that,
that,

2197
01:46:50,580 --> 01:46:51,413
that there's no such thing that like,
that islam is just like any other 

2198
01:46:54,541 --> 01:46:58,660
religion and like that they're ignoring 
like the,

2199
01:46:59,040 --> 01:47:03,260
like the majority of muslims like 
believe outside of us that day,

2200
01:47:03,360 --> 01:47:04,193
the United States or the uk or whatever,
that we are like living in horrible 

2201
01:47:08,581 --> 01:47:10,050
conditions.
Do look at me,

2202
01:47:10,051 --> 01:47:12,450
I'm living like fantastically compared 
to other people.

2203
01:47:12,480 --> 01:47:15,570
Even in Egypt,
no one bothers me.

2204
01:47:15,571 --> 01:47:18,150
I do whatever I want but some people 
can't.

2205
01:47:18,660 --> 01:47:23,660
And when when you start seeing things 
like that's like racist to just say that

2206
01:47:24,480 --> 01:47:25,313
we should like keep an eye on,
on some issues that are very important 

2207
01:47:29,431 --> 01:47:31,620
and you should like,
you liberal.

2208
01:47:31,740 --> 01:47:34,270
That's the problem too.
You should,

2209
01:47:34,770 --> 01:47:38,520
you know,
you should actually leave everything and

2210
01:47:38,521 --> 01:47:39,354
just focus on that.
There are people getting murdered to 

2211
01:47:41,521 --> 01:47:45,840
being gay or saying the wrong thing or 
for listening the wrong kind of music or

2212
01:47:46,410 --> 01:47:47,243
you should do that.
You should champion that cause not just 

2213
01:47:49,891 --> 01:47:53,350
for people living outside of year that's
just living inside you this and,

2214
01:47:53,360 --> 01:47:54,193
and the work travel because you know the
internet and all of that and don't even 

2215
01:47:58,141 --> 01:48:02,220
get me started on this nonsense about 
like feminism and islam.

2216
01:48:03,720 --> 01:48:05,330
Yeah.
We need like a whole other app.

2217
01:48:05,440 --> 01:48:07,090
You know what?
Here's what we do for real.

2218
01:48:07,120 --> 01:48:07,953
I'm going to do an hour with you because
this is just the beginning and I truly 

2219
01:48:10,691 --> 01:48:11,524
am a fan of yours,
so we're going to do a full hour 

2220
01:48:12,641 --> 01:48:13,474
together,
so I'm sorry we had to cut it short and 

2221
01:48:15,431 --> 01:48:17,350
you know what I was,
I think I told you this,

2222
01:48:17,351 --> 01:48:21,370
but I was in Egypt back in 1997.
It feels like a lifetime ago.

2223
01:48:21,600 --> 01:48:22,360
Uh,
and I,

2224
01:48:22,360 --> 01:48:25,400
I would love to go back at some point so
maybe we can work that to.

2225
01:48:26,220 --> 01:48:29,660
But we liked your tour guide.
I'm going to show you the pediments,

2226
01:48:29,680 --> 01:48:31,900
all the cliches and other stuff too.

2227
01:48:32,070 --> 01:48:34,610
All right.
I am on with khrushchev from India.

2228
01:48:34,620 --> 01:48:37,170
Kusha.
You are number one.

2229
01:48:37,200 --> 01:48:40,500
You are first on the big rubin report 
fan show.

2230
01:48:40,680 --> 01:48:41,970
How's it going in India today?

2231
01:48:43,750 --> 01:48:47,630
Now let's say I'm really happy that you 
have me over.

2232
01:48:48,540 --> 01:48:50,420
Good.
It's really hard right now actually.

2233
01:48:50,830 --> 01:48:52,960
Yeah.
Through what's really hot for you guys.

2234
01:48:53,550 --> 01:48:56,550
Oh,
celsius.

2235
01:48:56,551 --> 01:48:57,384
Not fahrenheit.
So it's actually right now it's 35 

2236
01:48:59,011 --> 01:49:02,400
degrees celsius.
And the humidity of 77 percent.

2237
01:49:02,520 --> 01:49:03,353
That'S pretty hot.

2238
01:49:03,450 --> 01:49:04,260
Oh man.
Are you.

2239
01:49:04,260 --> 01:49:06,810
Are you an air conditioning right now or
you just have a series of fans?

2240
01:49:06,900 --> 01:49:07,733
Air conditioning.

2241
01:49:07,830 --> 01:49:08,663
Yeah.

2242
01:49:08,950 --> 01:49:09,990
Very nice.
Alright,

2243
01:49:10,070 --> 01:49:12,260
well I'm super excited to talk to you 
now.

2244
01:49:12,261 --> 01:49:14,060
I don't know.
We've got a lot of responses.

2245
01:49:14,061 --> 01:49:14,894
I don't know that all one point 2 
billion with a b people in India 

2246
01:49:18,680 --> 01:49:19,513
responded.
But we did get a ton of responses from 

2247
01:49:21,621 --> 01:49:23,880
India about 100 people.
Uh,

2248
01:49:23,930 --> 01:49:25,250
so.
So you're the,

2249
01:49:25,251 --> 01:49:26,084
you're the lucky one out of 100.
So there was a lot of things that you 

2250
01:49:28,491 --> 01:49:30,710
sent me that I thought were really,
really interesting.

2251
01:49:30,920 --> 01:49:31,970
Uh,
so first off,

2252
01:49:32,000 --> 01:49:33,740
and a few people in India talked about 
this,

2253
01:49:34,010 --> 01:49:34,843
you mentioned just the general state of 
freedom of expression in India right 

2254
01:49:38,511 --> 01:49:39,344
now.
So can you tell me a little bit about 

2255
01:49:40,521 --> 01:49:43,340
your concerns about the state of freedom
of expression?

2256
01:49:44,690 --> 01:49:45,523
So here's the thing,
I don't want to paint a very dangerous 

2257
01:49:48,731 --> 01:49:51,220
scenario or something on that sort,
but you know,

2258
01:49:51,550 --> 01:49:53,620
as a skeptic,
I'm a skeptic myself.

2259
01:49:53,621 --> 01:49:54,920
So,
I mean,

2260
01:49:54,940 --> 01:49:55,773
in India we had some weird laws.
So I'll give you an example of a couple 

2261
01:49:58,061 --> 01:50:00,270
of situations.
So it all starts with a,

2262
01:50:00,490 --> 01:50:03,580
a particular constitutional article or 
two 95 eight.

2263
01:50:03,980 --> 01:50:08,080
So basically that article restricts any 
criticism of religion.

2264
01:50:08,770 --> 01:50:09,603
So I'm not going to give the whole text 
of the article to you because that will 

2265
01:50:12,291 --> 01:50:13,124
just take away a lot of time.
But the article says that you cannot 

2266
01:50:16,271 --> 01:50:21,010
hurt the sentiments of religious people 
and here's the funny part.

2267
01:50:21,100 --> 01:50:21,933
So it's basically a blasphemy law anD 
India is a 80 percent hindu country and 

2268
01:50:27,401 --> 01:50:30,300
hinduism does not even have a concept of
blessed with me.

2269
01:50:31,090 --> 01:50:31,923
So I mean it's hilarious actually.
But the history of the law is that in 

2270
01:50:35,771 --> 01:50:38,470
1926,
I think it was in 1926,

2271
01:50:38,471 --> 01:50:39,304
we had this,
a publisher who published a book called 

2272
01:50:41,351 --> 01:50:43,990
the gila soon.
So it's award in hindi.

2273
01:50:43,991 --> 01:50:48,991
So dragila resume means a prophet 
muhammad the casanova or the playboy.

2274
01:50:49,270 --> 01:50:50,103
So it basically spoke about the 
marriages and the sex life of prophet 

2275
01:50:53,870 --> 01:50:54,703
moment.
Now obviously muslims did not like her 

2276
01:50:57,011 --> 01:50:59,590
at that time and there was a lot of 
rioting.

2277
01:50:59,650 --> 01:51:03,550
This is in 1986.
So eventually the publisher was murdered

2278
01:51:04,240 --> 01:51:05,073
and the villagers,
because they didn't want to deal with 

2279
01:51:06,191 --> 01:51:07,024
it,
they just came up with is blasphemy law 

2280
01:51:08,410 --> 01:51:12,450
and we're just stuck with it now to 
2016.

2281
01:51:13,730 --> 01:51:14,563
Hold on.
So if hindu hinduism has no blast for 

2282
01:51:16,331 --> 01:51:18,680
me.
So it's really only being used one way.

2283
01:51:18,681 --> 01:51:20,900
It really sort of has nothing to do with
hinduism,

2284
01:51:20,910 --> 01:51:21,743
right?

2285
01:51:21,820 --> 01:51:22,511
Yeah,
it's not.

2286
01:51:22,511 --> 01:51:26,080
But the tragedy is that even hindus or 
started using this law,

2287
01:51:26,170 --> 01:51:27,210
that's the tragedy.
See,

2288
01:51:27,450 --> 01:51:28,080
see,
I,

2289
01:51:28,080 --> 01:51:29,530
I,
I might be a skeptic,

2290
01:51:29,531 --> 01:51:30,364
but I don't consider myself to be 
outside the hindu pantheon because you 

2291
01:51:33,961 --> 01:51:34,794
know,
we don't have that abrahamic problem 

2292
01:51:36,041 --> 01:51:36,874
where,
you know,

2293
01:51:37,110 --> 01:51:40,060
18 are considered outside.
The abrahamic pantene.

2294
01:51:40,360 --> 01:51:44,110
Hinduism had a very old tradition of 
atheism built in,

2295
01:51:44,350 --> 01:51:45,183
in itself.
It hurts me even more because I 

2296
01:51:48,101 --> 01:51:48,934
considered myself to be a hindu and we 
have this law and nobody talks about 

2297
01:51:52,071 --> 01:51:52,841
her.
I'm in,

2298
01:51:52,841 --> 01:51:54,840
there have been rationalists who had to 
live in the.

2299
01:51:54,860 --> 01:51:58,650
I'll give you an example.
There was a rationalist calls and allah,

2300
01:51:58,740 --> 01:52:01,210
I don't know his second name,
but I know his name so now.

2301
01:52:01,420 --> 01:52:02,253
So he basically went around in 2012 when
he was talking about how certain 

2302
01:52:05,771 --> 01:52:08,020
miracles claimed by christians were not 
real,

2303
01:52:08,290 --> 01:52:12,520
so they use this law and they've been 
down on him and he had to leave India.

2304
01:52:12,521 --> 01:52:15,670
He stays in Finland now.
And that's really sad.

2305
01:52:15,940 --> 01:52:17,980
Recently there was a comedian,
kiko,

2306
01:52:18,130 --> 01:52:21,190
the.
He made fun of a guru.

2307
01:52:21,760 --> 01:52:25,780
So the followers of that guru,
they went after him again.

2308
01:52:25,781 --> 01:52:30,190
He had to apologize and I can give you 
examples of various religions obviously.

2309
01:52:30,191 --> 01:52:34,990
I mean the highest amount of offense is 
caused by a particular religion,

2310
01:52:35,620 --> 01:52:36,910
which nobody talks about.

2311
01:52:37,340 --> 01:52:38,100
Right.
I got it.

2312
01:52:38,100 --> 01:52:38,933
I got a lot of emails about that.
I think everyone knows which one you're 

2313
01:52:41,001 --> 01:52:43,160
talking about.
So one of the things that you wrote that

2314
01:52:43,161 --> 01:52:43,994
I thought was really interesting you 
said wanted to make the distinction 

2315
01:52:46,910 --> 01:52:47,743
between tolerance and mutual respect.
And I really thought that was 

2316
01:52:51,321 --> 01:52:52,154
fascinating because here in America at 
least we talk about tolerance all the 

2317
01:52:54,891 --> 01:52:56,690
time.
We have to tolerate everybody,

2318
01:52:56,900 --> 01:52:59,420
but in a way that's not a very lofty 
thing.

2319
01:52:59,660 --> 01:53:02,120
Mutual respect is.
So can you explain that?

2320
01:53:02,500 --> 01:53:04,990
So basically,
it's not something that I've come up,

2321
01:53:04,991 --> 01:53:07,540
but it's a concept that was discussed 
and uh,

2322
01:53:07,541 --> 01:53:08,374
you know,
basically it's a concept introduced by 

2323
01:53:09,401 --> 01:53:11,950
indian american author called reggie 
mulatto.

2324
01:53:11,980 --> 01:53:14,770
He wrote a book called being different 
in 2011.

2325
01:53:15,070 --> 01:53:15,903
So what he basically talks about is 
every time we have an interfaith 

2326
01:53:18,190 --> 01:53:19,023
dialogue,
right?

2327
01:53:19,120 --> 01:53:23,050
So you have these interfaith dialogues 
where everybody around the table test,

2328
01:53:23,260 --> 01:53:25,030
oh,
we tolerate all religions,

2329
01:53:26,950 --> 01:53:29,320
spoke about it in a very beautiful way.
so the,

2330
01:53:29,321 --> 01:53:31,030
you know,
he went around asking people,

2331
01:53:31,210 --> 01:53:34,060
so do you tolerate your spouse in your 
house?

2332
01:53:34,270 --> 01:53:36,970
Do you tolerate someone when you're 
having dinner with them?

2333
01:53:37,230 --> 01:53:41,200
So I have just basically taken this 
concept being a skeptic.

2334
01:53:41,260 --> 01:53:43,750
Now I'm taking it to the next level and 
I'm saying,

2335
01:53:43,751 --> 01:53:44,680
okay,
here I am.

2336
01:53:44,740 --> 01:53:45,573
I'm a skeptic.
I may not agree with some use of 

2337
01:53:47,831 --> 01:53:48,664
hinduism.
I may not agree with a lot of views of 

2338
01:53:50,831 --> 01:53:51,664
islam or christianity,
but very mutual respect comes in is I 

2339
01:53:54,881 --> 01:53:55,714
don't need to tolerate you.
I need to respect you and you need to 

2340
01:53:58,181 --> 01:53:59,014
give me that respect back in return.
That's when you have a dialogue 

2341
01:54:02,090 --> 01:54:04,690
tolerances,
you're saying you suck,

2342
01:54:05,100 --> 01:54:06,640
but it's okay,
I'll let you be

2343
01:54:06,810 --> 01:54:08,070
right,
but I won't kill you.

2344
01:54:08,071 --> 01:54:09,770
Pretty much that's,

2345
01:54:10,600 --> 01:54:14,590
and this is again,
it stems from this exclusivist nature of

2346
01:54:14,591 --> 01:54:16,210
abrahamic religions.
See,

2347
01:54:16,211 --> 01:54:19,090
hindus don't have this problem and I'm 
being very honest.

2348
01:54:19,900 --> 01:54:22,380
I mean I've never faced a hindu saying,
you know,

2349
01:54:22,381 --> 01:54:24,010
I'm going to come across a hindu says,
oh,

2350
01:54:24,011 --> 01:54:25,630
I'll tolerate.
You know,

2351
01:54:25,631 --> 01:54:26,680
hindus would be like,
okay,

2352
01:54:26,681 --> 01:54:28,690
you don't believe in god,
you do your own thing.

2353
01:54:29,110 --> 01:54:31,390
I'll do my own thing.
But you know,

2354
01:54:31,400 --> 01:54:33,670
it's not like one god,
one book,

2355
01:54:33,820 --> 01:54:35,320
one religion.
It's not that.

2356
01:54:35,430 --> 01:54:39,870
So does that make the state of atheists 
in India much stronger?

2357
01:54:39,900 --> 01:54:41,460
Actually,
because I did get,

2358
01:54:41,820 --> 01:54:42,653
I would say probably half of the people 
that emailed us from India said they 

2359
01:54:45,061 --> 01:54:48,270
were atheists and didn't make it sound 
like they were hiding per se.

2360
01:54:48,271 --> 01:54:51,090
Obviously you're doing this right now,
so if hinduism,

2361
01:54:51,091 --> 01:54:55,080
which is 80 percent of the religion in 
India is sort of tolerant of atheism.

2362
01:54:55,081 --> 01:54:56,880
That's pretty fantastiC,
right?

2363
01:54:57,690 --> 01:54:58,260
Yeah,
it is.

2364
01:54:58,260 --> 01:54:59,093
See,
I like to classify indian atheism in 

2365
01:55:00,961 --> 01:55:01,794
three parts,
so there are the hindu atheist started 

2366
01:55:04,430 --> 01:55:06,000
the hindu dot skeptics.
I,

2367
01:55:06,001 --> 01:55:09,530
I call myself a skeptic,
so we,

2368
01:55:09,580 --> 01:55:12,060
we are not sure about some claims of 
hinduism,

2369
01:55:12,061 --> 01:55:15,180
so I would say I'm skeptical to 
reincarnation.

2370
01:55:15,660 --> 01:55:18,870
I'm skeptical to a few claims that the 
gurus make,

2371
01:55:19,560 --> 01:55:23,400
but there are a lot of thIngs in 
hinduism that are beautiful.

2372
01:55:23,490 --> 01:55:28,490
I mean I personally like the theory of 
karma as a action and reaction.

2373
01:55:29,100 --> 01:55:31,920
I think a karma could be taken as an 
action and reaction,

2374
01:55:32,610 --> 01:55:36,480
but then there are.
There's this new atheism in India,

2375
01:55:36,481 --> 01:55:37,314
I called them the marxist atheists.
So basically you have to understand the 

2376
01:55:42,120 --> 01:55:45,030
political scenario,
India and especially the media.

2377
01:55:45,420 --> 01:55:48,060
You have the social sciences and the 
humanities departments.

2378
01:55:48,360 --> 01:55:51,030
They keep churning out these marxist 
state tests.

2379
01:55:51,270 --> 01:55:52,103
So when you got a lot of emails,
I wouldn't be surprised that you must 

2380
01:55:54,391 --> 01:55:56,730
have gotten a lot of emails of those 
marks.

2381
01:55:56,731 --> 01:56:00,480
The status will paint a very different 
picture about hinduism to you.

2382
01:56:01,170 --> 01:56:03,820
And then I have the third category,
which is the one,

2383
01:56:03,870 --> 01:56:06,540
the ats.
So that peRson has not read anything,

2384
01:56:06,930 --> 01:56:11,930
so they just probably saw a video offer,
richard dawkins on youtube and they must

2385
01:56:11,991 --> 01:56:12,720
have gone,
okay,

2386
01:56:12,720 --> 01:56:14,340
I like this,
you know,

2387
01:56:15,200 --> 01:56:16,033
it's like that.
So I have three categorizations of 

2388
01:56:17,671 --> 01:56:20,700
atheism in India that are mixed skeptic.

2389
01:56:20,890 --> 01:56:21,800
Yeah.
Well listen,

2390
01:56:22,110 --> 01:56:25,130
I feel like we just started and you're 
my first person at a 20,

2391
01:56:25,131 --> 01:56:27,580
but our time is up already.
But I really,

2392
01:56:27,581 --> 01:56:28,414
I appreciate your support.
I appreciate you coming on and sharing 

2393
01:56:30,590 --> 01:56:33,620
your thoughts and I have got to make it 
out to India.

2394
01:56:33,770 --> 01:56:35,660
So when I do,
I'm going to look you up.

2395
01:56:36,120 --> 01:56:37,710
Yeah.
When you come to mumbai,

2396
01:56:37,800 --> 01:56:38,633
dinner's on me.

2397
01:56:39,300 --> 01:56:40,890
Done and done.
All right.

2398
01:56:40,891 --> 01:56:45,530
I am here with hannah in Texas in the 
good old us of a had.

2399
01:56:45,570 --> 01:56:46,403
How are you?

2400
01:56:46,840 --> 01:56:48,490
I am amazing.
How are you?

2401
01:56:48,630 --> 01:56:50,250
I'm doing well.
Uh,

2402
01:56:50,460 --> 01:56:51,293
texaS.
It feels like Texas is like a whole 

2403
01:56:53,221 --> 01:56:55,530
other country in a way.
What's going on in Texas?

2404
01:56:56,420 --> 01:56:59,150
Well,
honestly I think that we are better than

2405
01:56:59,151 --> 01:57:02,270
North Carolina right now.
That's pretty good.

2406
01:57:02,330 --> 01:57:03,820
That's pretty good.
Yeah.

2407
01:57:03,920 --> 01:57:06,830
I mean like we get,
we get a lot of bad rap here.

2408
01:57:06,910 --> 01:57:07,743
um,
but at the same time when you actually 

2409
01:57:09,171 --> 01:57:11,090
live here,
it really depends on where you live.

2410
01:57:11,120 --> 01:57:13,340
Like Texas is bigger than like France or
something,

2411
01:57:13,341 --> 01:57:16,880
right?
So I live close to dallas.

2412
01:57:17,180 --> 01:57:20,720
I'm not super close but about an hour 
away from that.

2413
01:57:20,780 --> 01:57:22,850
And the closer you are to these major 
cities,

2414
01:57:22,880 --> 01:57:23,713
the better it is,
but whenever you start getting out to 

2415
01:57:25,641 --> 01:57:30,641
the rural areas it gets kind of hickish 
but they're good people.

2416
01:57:34,180 --> 01:57:36,620
It's always like,
well intentioned,

2417
01:57:36,710 --> 01:57:38,900
good old boys sort of thing going on.

2418
01:57:39,950 --> 01:57:40,783
Alright.
Alright,

2419
01:57:40,830 --> 01:57:41,663
I'll go with that.
Well your submission was really great 

2420
01:57:44,071 --> 01:57:45,810
because you gave me,
you gave me a lot to work with you.

2421
01:57:45,811 --> 01:57:50,400
So first off you are trans big deal,
but you are trans.

2422
01:57:50,920 --> 01:57:52,440
Um,
yes.

2423
01:57:52,500 --> 01:57:55,020
And I,
I put a little asterisk on that.

2424
01:57:55,080 --> 01:57:55,913
Um,
I am somebody who is very anti labels 

2425
01:57:58,831 --> 01:58:01,050
and therE's a reason for this.
I'm not again,

2426
01:58:01,140 --> 01:58:04,980
special snowflakes stuff later,
but I don't know what I'm agreeing to.

2427
01:58:04,981 --> 01:58:07,170
Whenever I say yes,
I'm trans.

2428
01:58:07,860 --> 01:58:11,400
I mean like how far does that go?
That's always the big question.

2429
01:58:11,430 --> 01:58:13,050
Whenever you're saying,
are you a trans man,

2430
01:58:13,051 --> 01:58:14,400
trans woman,
transsexual,

2431
01:58:14,401 --> 01:58:15,560
transgender,
across,

2432
01:58:16,530 --> 01:58:20,190
where are the lines?
You know what I to if I say yes,

2433
01:58:20,191 --> 01:58:21,024
I am that,
but in a colloquial general 

2434
01:58:24,240 --> 01:58:29,240
understanding at the very basic level me
back just kind of stopped at the side.

2435
01:58:31,090 --> 01:58:31,923
I think that's really interesting and 
it's actUally kind of freeing because 

2436
01:58:33,881 --> 01:58:34,714
you as the person that identifies 
however you want to write it as if 

2437
01:58:38,560 --> 01:58:40,360
you're making the point of saying,
well,

2438
01:58:40,361 --> 01:58:44,600
sometimes these are a little confusing 
or don't quite get it right or all that.

2439
01:58:45,290 --> 01:58:46,123
Meanwhile,
meanwhile society is just obsessed with 

2440
01:58:47,861 --> 01:58:48,760
these labels,
right?

2441
01:58:49,790 --> 01:58:50,623
Yeah.
It's,

2442
01:58:51,260 --> 01:58:54,230
I have been doing this for close to nine
years now.

2443
01:58:56,810 --> 01:59:01,810
The thing with the internet is that you 
don't really know who is typing what.

2444
01:59:03,170 --> 01:59:06,200
So for the,
for the most part,

2445
01:59:06,230 --> 01:59:08,890
a lot of the trans stuff that comes out 
and people doing that,

2446
01:59:08,910 --> 01:59:09,743
it's probably people just trying on a 
persona or trying on an identity or 

2447
01:59:14,421 --> 01:59:17,240
something like that.
it's usually teenagers.

2448
01:59:17,810 --> 01:59:18,643
Um,
and I think that we kind of take them a 

2449
01:59:21,390 --> 01:59:23,840
little bit more seriously than we should
on a,

2450
01:59:23,860 --> 01:59:27,130
on a national hysteria type level.
Um,

2451
01:59:27,560 --> 01:59:31,490
but I don't necessarily see that there's
much wrong with it,

2452
01:59:31,491 --> 01:59:36,491
but it just let it be what it is instead
of making a big deal out of it.

2453
01:59:37,941 --> 01:59:40,280
If it's online,
like in person stuff,

2454
01:59:40,281 --> 01:59:45,281
like real tangible happenings,
that gets a little bit more attention or

2455
01:59:45,291 --> 01:59:46,124
should.
But whenever people online typing or 

2456
01:59:48,951 --> 01:59:52,340
posting or whatever,
it's like it could be anybody.

2457
01:59:54,250 --> 01:59:56,660
Are you telling me that tumbler is not 
real life?

2458
01:59:56,661 --> 02:00:00,260
Is that what you're telling me?
I know it'll blow your mind.

2459
02:00:02,690 --> 02:00:03,650
Wow.
You know,

2460
02:00:03,651 --> 02:00:06,980
you can be anything on the internet like
an attack helicopter.

2461
02:00:06,981 --> 02:00:10,070
That one's really popular now.
Is that a big one right now?

2462
02:00:11,300 --> 02:00:13,400
Identifying as an attack helicopter.
It's great.

2463
02:00:14,020 --> 02:00:14,960
So all right,
so let's,

2464
02:00:14,990 --> 02:00:15,823
let's back up a little bit.
So for someone that's watching this 

2465
02:00:17,091 --> 02:00:18,370
right now,
wherever theY are,

2466
02:00:18,490 --> 02:00:19,323
are in the world that has never heard 
from a trans person or the only trans 

2467
02:00:22,701 --> 02:00:25,010
person that they know of is caitlyn 
jenner.

2468
02:00:25,220 --> 02:00:28,340
Can you jusT tell me a little bit about 
growing up?

2469
02:00:28,341 --> 02:00:30,620
When did you realize you were trans,
etc.

2470
02:00:31,390 --> 02:00:33,050
This is always very difficult

2471
02:00:33,050 --> 02:00:36,410
because everybody's going to have like a
similar overarching narrative,

2472
02:00:36,411 --> 02:00:39,560
but it's going to have its different 
details.

2473
02:00:40,730 --> 02:00:44,740
I knew something was off as a child,
which is one of those common narratives,

2474
02:00:44,750 --> 02:00:45,583
but um,
I grew up southern baptist and being 

2475
02:00:49,280 --> 02:00:52,190
raised that way,
it's very kind of closed off.

2476
02:00:52,250 --> 02:00:55,010
Everybody that wasn't southern baptist 
was influenced by the devil,

2477
02:00:56,780 --> 02:01:00,290
but we moved around a lot and all that 
sort of thing.

2478
02:01:01,190 --> 02:01:06,140
And just,
I don't know how to qualify myself.

2479
02:01:06,500 --> 02:01:11,500
Like we are kind of the only people it 
seems nowadays where you have to explain

2480
02:01:11,961 --> 02:01:12,794
yourself,
rationalized to me why I should accept 

2481
02:01:17,510 --> 02:01:19,130
that you are who you say you are,

2482
02:01:19,200 --> 02:01:20,790
right?
You guys are the ones at the moment,

2483
02:01:20,791 --> 02:01:21,624
but you know what,
that won't last forever for whatever 

2484
02:01:22,741 --> 02:01:24,950
that's worth.
So it's one of those.

2485
02:01:25,240 --> 02:01:26,073
SeriouslY,
I wish I could give a definitive answer 

2486
02:01:29,541 --> 02:01:30,374
like,
this is exactly how I know I can point 

2487
02:01:32,061 --> 02:01:35,210
to these scientific studies.
This is exActly what happened.

2488
02:01:35,360 --> 02:01:36,320
I can't,
we don't,

2489
02:01:36,321 --> 02:01:37,154
we're not there yet when I can point is 
that trans people have existed 

2490
02:01:41,241 --> 02:01:43,990
throughout history and multiple 
cultures.

2491
02:01:44,000 --> 02:01:48,260
This is not a new thing.
It is only new to the american west.

2492
02:01:48,680 --> 02:01:49,513
Um,
and what I mean by that is the modern 

2493
02:01:51,210 --> 02:01:52,043
american west native tribes,
different allowances for different 

2494
02:01:55,401 --> 02:01:56,940
genders and gender roles.
Sure.

2495
02:01:57,440 --> 02:02:02,440
So it's only new to the north american 
west and I think that kinda goes back to

2496
02:02:03,321 --> 02:02:06,530
like a puritan european influence and 
whatnot,

2497
02:02:06,531 --> 02:02:11,531
kind of scrounging all deviancy from,
uh,

2498
02:02:12,740 --> 02:02:13,573
the possibility of,
of human experience and I'm sure that 

2499
02:02:16,790 --> 02:02:17,623
there were people back there and I'm 
white european colonials or whatever 

2500
02:02:22,401 --> 02:02:27,401
that were also trans but could not say 
anything or risk of being hung or killed

2501
02:02:29,571 --> 02:02:30,760
or whatever.
Yeah.

2502
02:02:30,770 --> 02:02:31,260
So

2503
02:02:31,260 --> 02:02:32,380
yeah,
I'm curious,

2504
02:02:32,410 --> 02:02:33,243
um,
how much of your sort of just mental 

2505
02:02:35,711 --> 02:02:36,544
energy and an ability to be a 
functioning person is about just having 

2506
02:02:39,791 --> 02:02:44,791
to explain yourself because that seems 
more exhausting in a way than,

2507
02:02:45,190 --> 02:02:47,320
than dealing with something personal.

2508
02:02:47,830 --> 02:02:52,630
It is exhausting and it was exhausting.
I think a Lot of trans people go through

2509
02:02:52,660 --> 02:02:55,810
very similar faces and their transition.
When I first started,

2510
02:02:55,811 --> 02:02:56,644
I was a helper.
I was going to be there for my trans 

2511
02:02:59,741 --> 02:03:03,670
sisters who were just starting also,
um,

2512
02:03:03,790 --> 02:03:04,623
I spent a lot of night sleepless.
I'm trying to keep people from killing 

2513
02:03:08,741 --> 02:03:10,540
themselves,
um,

2514
02:03:11,230 --> 02:03:15,190
but also trying to educate and explain 
and all this sort of thing.

2515
02:03:15,370 --> 02:03:17,450
And uh,
as time went on and I,

2516
02:03:17,650 --> 02:03:20,180
I got more passing privilege as we call 
it,

2517
02:03:20,220 --> 02:03:25,220
that I didn't have as many people 
stopping me and asking me,

2518
02:03:25,600 --> 02:03:28,630
um,
and I kind of developed sort of a,

2519
02:03:28,640 --> 02:03:29,473
a passive routine of like,
this is how I'm just going to interact 

2520
02:03:33,101 --> 02:03:36,220
with people and just be super kind,
super sweet and all that sort of thing.

2521
02:03:36,221 --> 02:03:39,310
And there's that pressure that you 
always have to be on your,

2522
02:03:39,311 --> 02:03:44,311
a game as a transwoman and around the 
normal people or whatever.

2523
02:03:44,710 --> 02:03:46,240
Right?
Um,

2524
02:03:46,300 --> 02:03:48,700
and there's,
there's two camps on this.

2525
02:03:48,730 --> 02:03:53,730
There's the radical queers who are like,
we should not be trying to fit in.

2526
02:03:53,801 --> 02:03:58,330
We are unique in our own way and it's 
beautiful and all this sort of thing.

2527
02:03:58,331 --> 02:04:00,250
And then there's the people who are 
like,

2528
02:04:00,280 --> 02:04:01,260
well,
no I don't.

2529
02:04:01,630 --> 02:04:02,463
I kind of just want to fit in it.
It's difficult trying to navigate this 

2530
02:04:08,291 --> 02:04:10,600
because it's very politicized.
Uh,

2531
02:04:10,990 --> 02:04:15,010
if you choose one side or the other or 
you try to not pick a side,

2532
02:04:15,011 --> 02:04:17,990
nobody's going to like you and you end 
up in your room all alone all the time.

2533
02:04:18,760 --> 02:04:19,840
Well,
is that,

2534
02:04:19,850 --> 02:04:20,683
is that one of the.
Is that one of the hardest things about 

2535
02:04:23,250 --> 02:04:24,083
sort of being a,
not only being a minority in this 

2536
02:04:27,001 --> 02:04:29,310
regard,
but like as I said,

2537
02:04:29,311 --> 02:04:32,730
trans issue seemed to be the minority of
the moment as you referenced before,

2538
02:04:32,731 --> 02:04:35,220
this issue with the bathrooms in North 
Carolina.

2539
02:04:35,250 --> 02:04:38,310
Everything trans is know,
makes edge

2540
02:04:38,310 --> 02:04:39,143
and it makes all the news.
So do you feel that you're under a 

2541
02:04:41,281 --> 02:04:44,700
microscope even in just your private 
life with everything that you do?

2542
02:04:44,980 --> 02:04:45,660
He.
Yes.

2543
02:04:45,660 --> 02:04:47,190
And here's,
here's the thing,

2544
02:04:47,280 --> 02:04:51,660
I have been using the women's restroom 
for eight years without any issue.

2545
02:04:52,290 --> 02:04:55,890
Now I'm scared because now,
I mean that's interesting.

2546
02:04:56,800 --> 02:05:00,720
Now people are looking,
now people are scrutinizing and whenever

2547
02:05:01,200 --> 02:05:04,320
governors or mayors or whoever it was in
North Carolina says,

2548
02:05:04,590 --> 02:05:09,590
women shouldn't spray people if they're 
scared in the bathroom.

2549
02:05:09,780 --> 02:05:12,180
And a year,
a year ago,

2550
02:05:12,350 --> 02:05:13,183
I'm a girl with a n,
I'm going to get in trouble for saying 

2551
02:05:16,561 --> 02:05:21,561
this genetic girl with the vagina 
actually got pulled out of a restroom by

2552
02:05:22,620 --> 02:05:25,510
men because could you say,
a genetic vagina?

2553
02:05:25,540 --> 02:05:26,373
So,
so a female regularly cis gendered 

2554
02:05:28,980 --> 02:05:31,130
female.
Cisgender.

2555
02:05:31,190 --> 02:05:34,500
So there's so many words on perform her 
femininity well enough.

2556
02:05:34,560 --> 02:05:36,030
Got it.
Right.

2557
02:05:36,470 --> 02:05:38,510
Um,
so that,

2558
02:05:38,630 --> 02:05:39,463
that's a specific issue and it always 
makes me wonder whenever things like 

2559
02:05:41,881 --> 02:05:43,590
this happening,
like what else is going on?

2560
02:05:43,650 --> 02:05:44,483
Like what,
what are the real issues that are going 

2561
02:05:45,841 --> 02:05:48,000
on right now whenever they put this 
panic out here,

2562
02:05:48,001 --> 02:05:51,030
like we've been around all this time,
but just for now,

2563
02:05:51,060 --> 02:05:53,910
for some reason right now,
now we talk about this,

2564
02:05:54,150 --> 02:05:55,980
now we need to have this national 
discussion.

2565
02:05:57,030 --> 02:05:58,720
What's the real issUe?
Like what's,

2566
02:05:58,750 --> 02:06:02,610
what's happening?
I'm the new cycle is pretty quick.

2567
02:06:02,611 --> 02:06:06,360
So I think this one,
hopefully we're shifted out of this one.

2568
02:06:06,720 --> 02:06:08,130
Yeah.
Um,

2569
02:06:08,630 --> 02:06:13,230
it's the process and everything,
I'm just saying this is blowing my mind.

2570
02:06:16,320 --> 02:06:17,153
So that's more of a specific issue and 
in this like the trans experience is 

2571
02:06:22,950 --> 02:06:23,783
hugely diverse,
as diverse as the queer experience and 

2572
02:06:27,121 --> 02:06:31,620
you're getting like who do you define as
trans because if you go with the tumbler

2573
02:06:31,800 --> 02:06:32,633
versions or whatnot,
if you cross dress on halloween for 

2574
02:06:34,531 --> 02:06:35,364
rocky horror picture show,
you qualify as trans now 

2575
02:06:36,931 --> 02:06:39,560
congratulations.
Um,

2576
02:06:39,860 --> 02:06:40,693
and you can't really say no,
you don't qualify if you're in that 

2577
02:06:43,891 --> 02:06:44,724
community because suddenly you're 
removing somebody's identity and you're 

2578
02:06:47,671 --> 02:06:49,470
going to get in trouble for that and all
that sort of thing.

2579
02:06:49,471 --> 02:06:50,304
So I'm just kinda like,
I need to accept the concept of 

2580
02:06:52,920 --> 02:06:53,753
[inaudible].
I don't know if you're familiar with 

2581
02:06:54,871 --> 02:06:55,630
that,
but.

2582
02:06:55,630 --> 02:06:57,020
No.
Yeah,

2583
02:06:57,030 --> 02:06:58,650
I quality as a term.
I'm kind of like,

2584
02:06:58,680 --> 02:07:02,000
I think so much that I'm an armchair 
philosopher,

2585
02:07:02,010 --> 02:07:06,910
but quality was a,
a word that was coined that was to,

2586
02:07:06,930 --> 02:07:10,590
to describe the specific experience that
we each have.

2587
02:07:10,650 --> 02:07:13,470
So whenever you look at like a blue 
wall,

2588
02:07:13,650 --> 02:07:17,220
you will have a certain range of 
emotions and feelinGs and all that.

2589
02:07:17,700 --> 02:07:22,700
And I will have a supposedly different 
one and that is quality so we can relate

2590
02:07:23,581 --> 02:07:24,414
that we're looking at a blue wall,
but whatever's invoked inside of us is 

2591
02:07:27,671 --> 02:07:28,504
going to be different.
So that's kinda like the trans 

2592
02:07:30,391 --> 02:07:31,224
experience in this.
The best I can do when it comes to 

2593
02:07:33,661 --> 02:07:38,661
rationalizing it was like I just know 
what I feel and I'm sorry that you can't

2594
02:07:39,851 --> 02:07:41,860
relate.
And again with the bathroom issue.

2595
02:07:41,920 --> 02:07:44,080
Oh my gosh.
Well listen,

2596
02:07:44,110 --> 02:07:45,840
I appreciate it.
Oh go ahead.

2597
02:07:45,950 --> 02:07:46,783
well I mean like I,
I appreciate people trying to relate to 

2598
02:07:48,611 --> 02:07:52,000
the trans issues and like whenever they 
think of the bathroom thing,

2599
02:07:52,001 --> 02:07:55,000
they're like why would I go to the 
bathroom?

2600
02:07:55,040 --> 02:07:56,950
Or,
or why do I think people would go to the

2601
02:07:56,951 --> 02:07:59,860
bathroom first thing that comes to mind 
while sexual assault or something.

2602
02:07:59,861 --> 02:08:00,431
Right.
And I'm like,

2603
02:08:00,431 --> 02:08:01,264
come on,
you should not get an address and go 

2604
02:08:02,291 --> 02:08:04,300
into the bathroom then like a year 
messed up.

2605
02:08:05,670 --> 02:08:08,800
There is one other thing that I wanted 
to talk about that you mentioned in your

2606
02:08:08,801 --> 02:08:10,570
submission that I thought was really 
interesting.

2607
02:08:10,810 --> 02:08:14,290
You brought up a phrase that I hadn't 
heard before called constructed illusion

2608
02:08:14,650 --> 02:08:18,350
and you related this to having a male 
and female voice

2609
02:08:18,470 --> 02:08:21,620
when you may use each one.
Can you tell me about that?

2610
02:08:22,650 --> 02:08:24,990
Um,
so this is what I'm.

2611
02:08:25,190 --> 02:08:26,023
people will call performing gender.
So I have developed this voice with 

2612
02:08:29,301 --> 02:08:31,160
years of training.
It's still,

2613
02:08:31,161 --> 02:08:34,410
my voice is just exercised,
right?

2614
02:08:34,880 --> 02:08:38,760
my arms aren't exercised,
but um,

2615
02:08:39,650 --> 02:08:40,483
so I have a wider range.
So with this voice I get treated 

2616
02:08:42,891 --> 02:08:43,724
different whenever I interact with 
people because I'm not threatening with 

2617
02:08:45,831 --> 02:08:48,740
this voice.
But if you're ready for this,

2618
02:08:50,630 --> 02:08:54,380
if I drop my voice,
I suddenly become a threats.

2619
02:08:54,890 --> 02:08:58,430
RiGht?
So I can switch between these two.

2620
02:08:58,550 --> 02:09:01,880
But that was the voice that's affected 
by testosterone.

2621
02:09:02,240 --> 02:09:07,220
And anybody who heard that I am 
immediately a different person.

2622
02:09:07,430 --> 02:09:09,080
There is no going back,
right?

2623
02:09:09,620 --> 02:09:10,453
The illusion is broken,
but how do they know that's just not 

2624
02:09:14,541 --> 02:09:15,374
another one of my develop voices.
And this is kind of why I call it 

2625
02:09:18,981 --> 02:09:22,700
constructed illusion because if it's 
related to magic tricks,

2626
02:09:22,701 --> 02:09:23,534
performance magic,
you do mr [inaudible] and all that sort 

2627
02:09:25,971 --> 02:09:26,804
of thing.

2628
02:09:27,080 --> 02:09:27,913
And it is a performance in a sense,
but in another sense it is me and it's 

2629
02:09:33,681 --> 02:09:37,430
really hard to really unpack that in a 
short amount of time.

2630
02:09:37,460 --> 02:09:42,260
But it's inter subjectivity with my 
voice.

2631
02:09:42,261 --> 02:09:43,094
It was for me at first,
but eventually I kind of start feelinG 

2632
02:09:45,861 --> 02:09:48,920
trapped by it because even though I've 
exercised this place,

2633
02:09:49,430 --> 02:09:54,310
I'm still not capable of a full ranGe of
emotional expression using it.

2634
02:09:54,580 --> 02:09:55,610
Makes sense.
Right.

2635
02:09:55,611 --> 02:09:56,444
But the,
I assume that there's an evolution with 

2636
02:09:57,351 --> 02:09:57,771
that,
right?

2637
02:09:57,771 --> 02:09:58,820
Like you'll,
you'll get there,

2638
02:09:58,880 --> 02:10:02,090
so to speak eventually,
but it takes a lot,

2639
02:10:02,091 --> 02:10:03,350
a lot,
a lot of practice.

2640
02:10:03,710 --> 02:10:04,543
So this,
this goes back into like passing 

2641
02:10:05,901 --> 02:10:10,901
privilege and all that sort of thing.
So it was really nice talking to you and

2642
02:10:11,601 --> 02:10:14,180
I probably talk talking to you.
So ecstatic.

2643
02:10:14,400 --> 02:10:16,440
Alright,
I'm on with jason and brussels.

2644
02:10:16,441 --> 02:10:17,430
Jason,
has it gone?

2645
02:10:17,970 --> 02:10:20,100
Fantastic.
A pleasure to be on.

2646
02:10:20,460 --> 02:10:21,300
yeah.
Well,

2647
02:10:21,301 --> 02:10:23,190
uh,
I'm excited to talk to you.

2648
02:10:23,191 --> 02:10:26,490
So you are in brussels,
but originally from cypress.

2649
02:10:26,491 --> 02:10:28,860
So we're going to get this.
We're going to get to Cyprus in a minute

2650
02:10:28,861 --> 02:10:29,694
because nobody talks about Cyprus,
but it's a really interesting tiny 

2651
02:10:31,981 --> 02:10:34,220
little country that very people know 
about a,

2652
02:10:34,240 --> 02:10:35,073
but you're in brussels now,
obviously the last few months in 

2653
02:10:37,491 --> 02:10:38,324
Belgium,
but especially in brussels have been 

2654
02:10:40,071 --> 02:10:42,140
very tough.
So can you just start with that?

2655
02:10:43,240 --> 02:10:44,073
Well,
yeah,

2656
02:10:44,470 --> 02:10:46,930
I have to say it hasn't affected people 
on a,

2657
02:10:47,100 --> 02:10:47,933
on a conscious level.
I mean you see people going about their 

2658
02:10:49,751 --> 02:10:52,960
daily routine,
but it's definitely had a very malicious

2659
02:10:52,961 --> 02:10:57,820
sort of subconscious undertone,
particularly since the paris attacks.

2660
02:10:58,230 --> 02:10:59,063
Uh,
we've had a martial law on and off and 

2661
02:11:03,251 --> 02:11:04,084
it's very concerning when you see four 
armed soldiers outside mcdonalds and an 

2662
02:11:09,200 --> 02:11:11,670
armored car outside your workplace.
Yeah.

2663
02:11:12,310 --> 02:11:13,800
So,
um,

2664
02:11:13,840 --> 02:11:14,520
yeah,
it's,

2665
02:11:14,520 --> 02:11:15,353
it's,
it's been very strange and the attacks 

2666
02:11:17,410 --> 02:11:21,130
actually happened at a metro station 
that I use quite frequently.

2667
02:11:22,210 --> 02:11:25,990
So when you see these changes,
you see more soldiers out there,

2668
02:11:26,000 --> 02:11:28,510
you see more security and all that kind 
of stuff.

2669
02:11:28,870 --> 02:11:29,703
How does that change your general psyche
like that you're walking to work and 

2670
02:11:32,831 --> 02:11:33,664
you're seeing this stuff?
It changes just sort of the day to day 

2671
02:11:36,131 --> 02:11:36,964
right?

2672
02:11:37,250 --> 02:11:37,551
Well,
no,

2673
02:11:37,551 --> 02:11:40,210
you become accustomed to it actually,
but uh,

2674
02:11:40,250 --> 02:11:43,280
I mean it's,
it's very disturbing to see the military

2675
02:11:43,281 --> 02:11:46,520
deployed in a western capital,
uh,

2676
02:11:47,110 --> 02:11:50,600
I mean it's like the problem is truly 
have become a global,

2677
02:11:52,390 --> 02:11:57,390
so there were a lot of reports after the
attacks in brussels that in parts of the

2678
02:11:59,140 --> 02:12:01,090
community that one of the attackers was 
from,

2679
02:12:01,091 --> 02:12:04,510
and I guess they found him a couple of 
weeks later that the community there was

2680
02:12:04,511 --> 02:12:08,140
knowingly hiding him were people talking
about that in Belgium.

2681
02:12:08,141 --> 02:12:11,380
It's sort of trickled it's way into 
western media but not really.

2682
02:12:11,381 --> 02:12:14,080
And then it was kind of hard to tell 
what was actually true.

2683
02:12:14,980 --> 02:12:15,813
Well,
I don't think that he's just a problem 

2684
02:12:17,141 --> 02:12:19,390
that's isolated to Belgium.
I think in general,

2685
02:12:19,660 --> 02:12:20,493
um,
we don't see a members of the local 

2686
02:12:23,251 --> 02:12:27,300
community where many of these suspects 
from turning them in,

2687
02:12:27,920 --> 02:12:28,753
making a concerted effort with the 
authority and it is something that we 

2688
02:12:33,870 --> 02:12:37,170
have to try and deal with through better
integration policies.

2689
02:12:37,760 --> 02:12:39,740
yeah.
So how is the integration going,

2690
02:12:39,741 --> 02:12:40,970
I guess?
I guess to that point,

2691
02:12:40,971 --> 02:12:42,320
it's probably not going that great.

2692
02:12:43,160 --> 02:12:43,591
No,
no,

2693
02:12:43,591 --> 02:12:44,424
no,
it's terrible.

2694
02:12:44,430 --> 02:12:46,680
I mean,
you have different communities that live

2695
02:12:46,681 --> 02:12:48,460
parallel lives,
uh,

2696
02:12:48,860 --> 02:12:49,820
which,
uh,

2697
02:12:50,600 --> 02:12:51,570
I mean,
they,

2698
02:12:51,590 --> 02:12:54,200
they exist occasionally in the physical 
space because,

2699
02:12:54,230 --> 02:12:55,063
I mean,
you opened the physical spaces overlap 

2700
02:12:56,811 --> 02:12:57,644
slightly,
but they just live in a different 

2701
02:12:59,271 --> 02:13:00,104
reality.

2702
02:13:00,390 --> 02:13:02,670
Right?
So how much of That,

2703
02:13:02,760 --> 02:13:04,320
where do you place all the blame on 
that?

2704
02:13:04,321 --> 02:13:07,440
Because this is one of the things that a
lot of people emailed us about was,

2705
02:13:07,470 --> 02:13:08,303
was this idea,
especially people in europe were saying 

2706
02:13:10,770 --> 02:13:15,300
that a lot of the muslIm communities 
aren't integrating properly and they see

2707
02:13:15,510 --> 02:13:17,490
some people were sort of blaming their 
own governments.

2708
02:13:17,491 --> 02:13:19,830
Some people were blaming the,
uh,

2709
02:13:19,831 --> 02:13:21,270
the muslim communities.
It's,

2710
02:13:21,330 --> 02:13:23,490
my guess is that the truth is somewhere 
in between.

2711
02:13:23,491 --> 02:13:24,324
What do you think?

2712
02:13:24,340 --> 02:13:25,173
Well,
I like to go from more abstractly and 

2713
02:13:26,661 --> 02:13:28,580
say that the problem has been,
uh,

2714
02:13:29,030 --> 02:13:34,030
because of our social justice approach 
or rather aggressive approach giving,

2715
02:13:35,910 --> 02:13:40,500
we've been giving rights to a 
communities rather than two individuals.

2716
02:13:41,220 --> 02:13:44,580
And it's very arbitrary to,
to define a community in a certain way.

2717
02:13:45,130 --> 02:13:46,440
Uh,
and um,

2718
02:13:47,190 --> 02:13:48,023
and you know,
because the premise of our 

2719
02:13:49,411 --> 02:13:52,440
individualized kind of rule of law has 
been,

2720
02:13:53,060 --> 02:13:53,893
uh,
the rights should be given to 

2721
02:13:55,800 --> 02:13:58,380
individuals and not to,
um,

2722
02:13:58,950 --> 02:14:00,780
you know,
what social justice people,

2723
02:14:01,890 --> 02:14:04,560
however,
social justice people decide to classify

2724
02:14:04,561 --> 02:14:05,430
people as.

2725
02:14:06,200 --> 02:14:08,350
So how much have those ideas?
Clearly you're,

2726
02:14:08,351 --> 02:14:10,700
you're speaking my language.
It's about the individual,

2727
02:14:10,701 --> 02:14:13,520
not the group.
Let's get away from this oppression,

2728
02:14:13,521 --> 02:14:14,354
olympics thing,
all of that stuff which we've talked 

2729
02:14:15,891 --> 02:14:20,120
about so much here.
How much of that ideology is,

2730
02:14:20,121 --> 02:14:21,770
has taken hold in Belgium?

2731
02:14:23,330 --> 02:14:24,300
Well,
I'm,

2732
02:14:24,530 --> 02:14:25,030
I'm,
I'm,

2733
02:14:25,030 --> 02:14:25,863
I'm more qualified to talk about 
specifically about how this is 

2734
02:14:29,180 --> 02:14:34,180
manifested in the uk because I've been 
doing a study on that.

2735
02:14:35,030 --> 02:14:35,863
So you've been,
you've been studying this in the uk 

2736
02:14:37,131 --> 02:14:39,140
about a school system,
right?

2737
02:14:39,460 --> 02:14:40,410
System,
yeah.

2738
02:14:41,120 --> 02:14:42,690
Because in the,
uh,

2739
02:14:42,760 --> 02:14:43,593
in the british school system,
what you have is you have a third of 

2740
02:14:45,460 --> 02:14:46,293
schools which are regardless,
which are faith schools that receive 

2741
02:14:48,860 --> 02:14:50,780
public money,
uh,

2742
02:14:50,840 --> 02:14:51,920
because,
uh,

2743
02:14:51,921 --> 02:14:54,200
they have designated a religious 
character.

2744
02:14:55,100 --> 02:14:55,933
And what we see here is that I believe 
that the child's rights are being 

2745
02:15:02,660 --> 02:15:05,300
infringed upon because,
uh,

2746
02:15:05,450 --> 02:15:08,600
basically because the child is 
classified as,

2747
02:15:08,740 --> 02:15:11,850
as belonging to a particular community,
uh,

2748
02:15:12,120 --> 02:15:15,530
they get labeled by very arbitrary 
criteria,

2749
02:15:16,160 --> 02:15:17,950
um,
and um,

2750
02:15:18,340 --> 02:15:23,340
and attend a faith schools just to 
fulfill the aims of social justice.

2751
02:15:27,891 --> 02:15:32,450
And I think that this is a,
this is a very large structural problem.

2752
02:15:32,980 --> 02:15:35,480
It's a bizarrely backwards thing that we
do in the west.

2753
02:15:35,481 --> 02:15:36,314
I mean,
we do this in America with several 

2754
02:15:37,281 --> 02:15:38,114
religions where the government funds 
sort of faith based schools even though 

2755
02:15:41,931 --> 02:15:43,880
we're totally secular society.

2756
02:15:45,250 --> 02:15:46,083
Well,
yes.

2757
02:15:46,120 --> 02:15:48,470
And um,
and you know,

2758
02:15:48,850 --> 02:15:50,350
shockingly,
in the uk,

2759
02:15:51,500 --> 02:15:53,000
the faith goals have a,
have a,

2760
02:15:53,150 --> 02:15:55,900
have an exemption from,
from even the equality act.

2761
02:15:55,901 --> 02:15:56,734
I mean it's written in the law that they
have an exemption from treating people 

2762
02:16:00,461 --> 02:16:02,800
equally and employment and,
and admission.

2763
02:16:04,030 --> 02:16:04,863
And uh,
the problem is although the schools are 

2764
02:16:06,971 --> 02:16:08,800
obliged to teach the national 
curriculum,

2765
02:16:08,830 --> 02:16:09,663
they teach it through a religious lens.
So you might learn about many secular 

2766
02:16:13,500 --> 02:16:14,333
subjects,
but then about other religions and 

2767
02:16:16,861 --> 02:16:19,740
secularism and how to behave in a civic 
society.

2768
02:16:19,741 --> 02:16:20,574
But if you also learned that the penalty
for apostasy is death and that the law 

2769
02:16:25,830 --> 02:16:28,360
and that the law of god,
uh,

2770
02:16:28,440 --> 02:16:31,900
in the arEa above the,
the law of the state,

2771
02:16:32,410 --> 02:16:33,243
then you're less likely to want to 
integrate and be part of the cohesive 

2772
02:16:36,401 --> 02:16:37,210
society.

2773
02:16:37,210 --> 02:16:37,871
Yeah,
I mean,

2774
02:16:37,871 --> 02:16:38,704
to me that's,
that gets to the heart of the social 

2775
02:16:40,271 --> 02:16:43,390
justice stuff because it seeps into the 
education system.

2776
02:16:43,630 --> 02:16:48,580
Then you have a government that is 
subsidizing basically religious teachinG

2777
02:16:48,760 --> 02:16:50,560
a suicide.
Yeah.

2778
02:16:50,590 --> 02:16:51,423
Alright.
So let's move away from that for a 

2779
02:16:51,961 --> 02:16:53,590
little because I do want to talk about 
Cyprus with you.

2780
02:16:53,591 --> 02:16:58,060
So nobody knows about cypress.
It is a tiny little island country.

2781
02:16:58,240 --> 02:16:59,073
You're from there.
Just tell me a little bit about your 

2782
02:17:00,491 --> 02:17:01,324
history.
You don't have to give me the whole 

2783
02:17:01,661 --> 02:17:02,870
history of cypress.
Uh,

2784
02:17:02,920 --> 02:17:04,640
but tell me a little bit.
I'll give you the,

2785
02:17:04,740 --> 02:17:06,920
the recent history that most,
uh,

2786
02:17:07,770 --> 02:17:09,260
significant now.
Yeah.

2787
02:17:09,520 --> 02:17:10,221
Uh,
yeah.

2788
02:17:10,221 --> 02:17:11,780
Well,
in 1974,

2789
02:17:11,781 --> 02:17:12,614
the turkish army occupied half of 
cypress and the island has been divided 

2790
02:17:17,331 --> 02:17:18,164
since then.
The turkish state installed a kind of 

2791
02:17:22,341 --> 02:17:25,760
fag republic that's only recognized by 
Turkey and Pakistan.

2792
02:17:26,630 --> 02:17:27,600
And,
uh,

2793
02:17:27,670 --> 02:17:31,250
have been ongoing attempts to resolve 
the situation,

2794
02:17:31,790 --> 02:17:32,840
uh,
over the decades,

2795
02:17:33,470 --> 02:17:34,380
but,
um,

2796
02:17:35,120 --> 02:17:35,953
I feel that I'm not very optimistic 
about the two sides coming through a 

2797
02:17:39,261 --> 02:17:42,560
settlement because of the physical power
that Turkey is exerting.

2798
02:17:42,561 --> 02:17:43,394
I think whether Turkey withdraws or not,
it's mainly a subject of the trajectory 

2799
02:17:49,071 --> 02:17:52,010
of turkish foreign policy and whether 
it's in turkey's interest to leave.

2800
02:17:53,300 --> 02:17:54,133
and my hope is that because turkish 
foreign policy has become increasingly 

2801
02:17:58,690 --> 02:18:03,690
islamophobia and it's shifting away from
the foreign policy of the west,

2802
02:18:04,610 --> 02:18:05,443
that the west might slowly,
and I suppose there's a growing 

2803
02:18:08,961 --> 02:18:09,794
relationship between Cyprus and Israel 
and my hope is that the west eventually 

2804
02:18:13,461 --> 02:18:14,294
aligns its foreign policy closer to 
secularist entities throughout the 

2805
02:18:20,271 --> 02:18:23,600
region,
like the kurds for example also.

2806
02:18:24,310 --> 02:18:25,143
Um,
and my hope is that that will will lead 

2807
02:18:27,741 --> 02:18:29,060
to a better.
Um,

2808
02:18:29,900 --> 02:18:30,733
we'll,
we'll give cypress leverage in 

2809
02:18:33,951 --> 02:18:37,150
negotiations because it will have the 
backing from the west list.

2810
02:18:37,160 --> 02:18:37,590
So

2811
02:18:37,590 --> 02:18:38,071
yeah.
Well,

2812
02:18:38,071 --> 02:18:39,990
I promise you that I will talk about it 
more because,

2813
02:18:39,991 --> 02:18:41,340
you know,
we've talked about the kurds here,

2814
02:18:41,341 --> 02:18:44,040
but as you said,
cypress is a sovereign nation,

2815
02:18:44,041 --> 02:18:49,041
a united nations member country.
And it's in full occupation since 1974.

2816
02:18:49,471 --> 02:18:50,700
So there's a lot.
Listen,

2817
02:18:50,770 --> 02:18:52,800
there's a lot more that we could talk 
about unfortunately.

2818
02:18:52,860 --> 02:18:54,840
We got to move on.
I got a long day of interviews,

2819
02:18:55,080 --> 02:18:57,330
but it's been a pleasure talking to you.
All right.

2820
02:18:57,331 --> 02:18:59,200
I'm on with gel up in Canada.
Jill.

2821
02:18:59,220 --> 02:19:00,690
How are you?
I'm good,

2822
02:19:00,691 --> 02:19:03,150
thanks.
Well it's good to have you here now.

2823
02:19:03,151 --> 02:19:05,160
First off,
before we get into any of the issues you

2824
02:19:05,161 --> 02:19:08,700
emailed me about,
is it true that Canada is going to build

2825
02:19:08,701 --> 02:19:12,570
a wall to keep americans out regardless 
of who wins our presidential election?

2826
02:19:14,240 --> 02:19:16,200
I've heard rumors,
yes.

2827
02:19:16,950 --> 02:19:18,120
Okay.
Rumors.

2828
02:19:18,190 --> 02:19:19,830
All right,
we're going to get that on the internet.

2829
02:19:20,010 --> 02:19:20,843
Okay.
So you sent me some really interesting 

2830
02:19:21,751 --> 02:19:22,584
stuff that sort of touched on some of 
the things that we talk about on the 

2831
02:19:25,171 --> 02:19:27,650
show,
but then you really went in another with

2832
02:19:27,651 --> 02:19:27,980
it,
which

2833
02:19:27,980 --> 02:19:28,813
is why I wanted to have you on.
So one of the things you mentioned a is 

2834
02:19:31,221 --> 02:19:32,054
that sort of the mental health anti 
stigma campaigns that we see these days 

2835
02:19:37,730 --> 02:19:41,060
are actually part of the regressive left
ideology.

2836
02:19:41,300 --> 02:19:42,133
Now I gave a lot of buzzwords there.
So can you unpack that for me a little 

2837
02:19:44,391 --> 02:19:45,224
bit?

2838
02:19:46,090 --> 02:19:48,790
I think so.
Not very many people,

2839
02:19:48,791 --> 02:19:51,240
um,
agree with me on it.

2840
02:19:51,550 --> 02:19:52,211
Well,
let's see.

2841
02:19:52,211 --> 02:19:53,044
Let's see.

2842
02:19:53,140 --> 02:19:56,410
Well,
it's the same sort of victim mentality,

2843
02:19:56,890 --> 02:19:57,723
um,
except pretty much anyone can be a part 

2844
02:20:01,451 --> 02:20:02,284
of it.
It seems almost like a club to be 

2845
02:20:04,061 --> 02:20:07,480
mentally ill these days and a lot of 
times it's,

2846
02:20:07,481 --> 02:20:11,410
ignores the real issues.
Like right now I'm in Canada,

2847
02:20:11,430 --> 02:20:14,860
we have a huge crisis with the first 
nations communities,

2848
02:20:15,370 --> 02:20:18,070
like lots of youth are committing 
suicide,

2849
02:20:18,880 --> 02:20:19,713
but of course the anti stigma campaigns 
want to hijack this and make it about 

2850
02:20:22,690 --> 02:20:25,510
illness.
But if you actually talk to these youth,

2851
02:20:25,511 --> 02:20:27,010
they say,
well,

2852
02:20:27,011 --> 02:20:29,280
we have no hope because there is no hope
here.

2853
02:20:29,290 --> 02:20:31,480
We have no jobs,
we have no library,

2854
02:20:31,481 --> 02:20:33,610
things like that.
Um,

2855
02:20:33,611 --> 02:20:34,444
so I think just the campaigns tend to 
really stay away from the issues and 

2856
02:20:39,670 --> 02:20:42,280
tend to put people again in the victim 
role.

2857
02:20:42,560 --> 02:20:43,393
Yeah.
So you're sort of talking about two 

2858
02:20:44,181 --> 02:20:45,014
things there.
So on one hand there's the feeling if 

2859
02:20:47,091 --> 02:20:51,010
the economy is not good or their family 
life isn't good or whatever it is,

2860
02:20:51,011 --> 02:20:51,844
it is sort of a reality in their life 
versus these campaigns that in a weird 

2861
02:20:55,941 --> 02:20:59,270
way because of this oppression olympics 
that we've talked about,

2862
02:20:59,510 --> 02:21:00,343
kind of make it cool to say,
well this is wrong with me or this is 

2863
02:21:03,201 --> 02:21:05,240
wrong with me or I have this or this or 
that.

2864
02:21:05,241 --> 02:21:05,920
Correct.

2865
02:21:05,920 --> 02:21:08,170
Yeah.
There seems to be a bit of a hierarchy.

2866
02:21:08,171 --> 02:21:13,171
Like it's more cool to be like bipolar 
then to be depressed and,

2867
02:21:14,170 --> 02:21:17,560
and they seem to be seeing except me 
because I'm not like you.

2868
02:21:18,040 --> 02:21:21,790
Whereas we all know like the way towards
acceptance is to be,

2869
02:21:21,820 --> 02:21:23,170
well we're,
we're all human,

2870
02:21:23,171 --> 02:21:25,390
we're all the same.
But um,

2871
02:21:26,170 --> 02:21:31,170
they're really going for no because I'm 
different and it's not my fault.

2872
02:21:32,800 --> 02:21:36,670
So sort of for people who don't have an 
illness,

2873
02:21:36,671 --> 02:21:37,504
what does that mean?
If they're struggling that they 

2874
02:21:39,221 --> 02:21:40,720
shouldn't be accepted.
So.

2875
02:21:41,030 --> 02:21:42,530
Right.
That's really kind of fascinating.

2876
02:21:42,531 --> 02:21:45,730
So someone who doesn't have a,
any,

2877
02:21:45,770 --> 02:21:46,603
any known condition,
so to speak in a weird way then then it 

2878
02:21:49,851 --> 02:21:52,760
feels worse for them because they're 
supposed to feel okay,

2879
02:21:52,761 --> 02:21:53,510
right?

2880
02:21:53,510 --> 02:21:54,500
Yeah.
Yeah.

2881
02:21:54,740 --> 02:21:55,573
And there's a lot of research showing 
that the more we sort of give people 

2882
02:22:00,861 --> 02:22:03,520
these information about these elements 
to some more,

2883
02:22:04,090 --> 02:22:05,930
uh,
we create them in people,

2884
02:22:06,250 --> 02:22:07,250
uh,
because it's,

2885
02:22:07,280 --> 02:22:08,113
it's very much cultural and uh,
but they just have to get a brain scan 

2886
02:22:13,431 --> 02:22:16,160
and people pay attention because they 
think that science.

2887
02:22:16,290 --> 02:22:17,490
Yeah.
Do you guys have the,

2888
02:22:17,491 --> 02:22:19,710
all the crazy commercials that we have 
in the states,

2889
02:22:19,711 --> 02:22:20,610
you know,
you turn on the tv,

2890
02:22:20,611 --> 02:22:21,444
especially any of the cable news shows 
and all the commercials are for one 

2891
02:22:23,851 --> 02:22:25,830
depression medicine or,
and you know,

2892
02:22:25,831 --> 02:22:26,010
there's

2893
02:22:26,010 --> 02:22:26,843
a cartoon cloud following somebody and 
take this medication with this 

2894
02:22:30,031 --> 02:22:30,864
medication and it makes everybody think 
that they're depressed or somehow 

2895
02:22:34,381 --> 02:22:35,214
defective.

2896
02:22:35,680 --> 02:22:37,420
Yeah.
I don't watch tv,

2897
02:22:37,421 --> 02:22:39,640
but uh,
I'm sure we did have those.

2898
02:22:39,760 --> 02:22:40,240
Your,

2899
02:22:40,240 --> 02:22:42,160
you're a wise woman.
Um,

2900
02:22:42,220 --> 02:22:43,053
so a lot of this though,
from what you wrote to me is very 

2901
02:22:44,561 --> 02:22:48,100
personal for you because you're a 
recovering addict yourself,

2902
02:22:48,101 --> 02:22:49,630
right?
Yeah,

2903
02:22:49,660 --> 02:22:51,430
so can you tell me a little bit about 
that,

2904
02:22:51,450 --> 02:22:53,080
that either a,
you know,

2905
02:22:53,081 --> 02:22:54,820
what you were doing,
how you got out,

2906
02:22:54,950 --> 02:22:55,783
cetera.
You don't have to give me every bit of 

2907
02:22:57,491 --> 02:22:58,380
personal stuff,
but

2908
02:22:58,440 --> 02:22:59,540
yeah.
Um,

2909
02:22:59,541 --> 02:23:02,930
I would say heroin,
I guess I still am a heroin addict.

2910
02:23:03,450 --> 02:23:05,190
Um,
man,

2911
02:23:05,210 --> 02:23:07,490
I don't know,
not much to say about that.

2912
02:23:08,000 --> 02:23:09,150
Yeah.
And,

2913
02:23:09,200 --> 02:23:12,360
and are you,
you're in full recovery or I guess it's,

2914
02:23:12,361 --> 02:23:14,860
it's a lifelong struggle I suppose.
Right?

2915
02:23:14,990 --> 02:23:15,710
Yeah.
Uh,

2916
02:23:15,710 --> 02:23:16,670
almost two years.

2917
02:23:16,950 --> 02:23:18,120
Wow.
So,

2918
02:23:18,121 --> 02:23:18,954
uh,
the other thing that you wanted to talk 

2919
02:23:19,681 --> 02:23:20,514
about,
which of course is related to all this 

2920
02:23:21,301 --> 02:23:24,960
is the war on drugs and you know,
this is something we talk about a lot in

2921
02:23:24,961 --> 02:23:26,590
America.
Um,

2922
02:23:26,640 --> 02:23:27,473
I'm not that familiar with the,
with the drug situation in Canada in 

2923
02:23:30,601 --> 02:23:32,310
general.
Can you tell me a bit?

2924
02:23:33,220 --> 02:23:37,360
Um,
I probably don't follow politics as much

2925
02:23:37,361 --> 02:23:38,380
as they should.
I get,

2926
02:23:38,600 --> 02:23:40,990
I get too depressed,
but uh,

2927
02:23:41,020 --> 02:23:46,020
I have read a lot of bruce alexander's 
work and vancouver,

2928
02:23:46,391 --> 02:23:51,280
which is where I'm from originally.
I has the worst addiction problem in the

2929
02:23:51,281 --> 02:23:52,114
world pretty much.
So he talks a lot about how 

2930
02:23:54,671 --> 02:23:55,504
globalization has affected that and the 
war on drugs pretty much focuses on the 

2931
02:24:01,241 --> 02:24:06,241
drugs themselves as being evil.
And it's really not about the drugs.

2932
02:24:07,090 --> 02:24:10,510
I'm bruce alexander's work in the 
seventies.

2933
02:24:10,511 --> 02:24:15,511
He pretty much disproved all other 
notions of addiction,

2934
02:24:17,380 --> 02:24:22,380
but people are still held onto it.
Basically it was called rat park.

2935
02:24:23,620 --> 02:24:24,453
Um,
he gave some rats morphine water and of 

2936
02:24:29,711 --> 02:24:33,970
course they used it up,
which is pretty much identical almost to

2937
02:24:34,020 --> 02:24:34,853
heroin,
but then he puts another group of rats 

2938
02:24:37,810 --> 02:24:38,643
in like a bigger container where they 
could socialize and they could play and 

2939
02:24:45,550 --> 02:24:46,383
they had lots of room and those racks 
wouldn't drink the morphine water even 

2940
02:24:51,491 --> 02:24:55,000
when they had already forced them into 
physical dependency.

2941
02:24:55,760 --> 02:24:56,593
Um,
so that to me is evidence against this 

2942
02:25:00,701 --> 02:25:05,590
whole crazy notion that we should be 
fighting drugs.

2943
02:25:05,950 --> 02:25:09,820
Canada is in probably in the same state 
as America,

2944
02:25:09,821 --> 02:25:11,470
but we are certainly getting there.

2945
02:25:11,950 --> 02:25:12,783
Yeah.
But you guys do have some places with 

2946
02:25:14,581 --> 02:25:15,610
vancouver,
for example,

2947
02:25:15,611 --> 02:25:17,320
where at least marijuana is legal,
right?

2948
02:25:18,510 --> 02:25:20,300
Um,
it's not legal.

2949
02:25:20,420 --> 02:25:21,690
I don't think,
uh,

2950
02:25:21,910 --> 02:25:24,870
we do have the safe sites,
but uh,

2951
02:25:25,440 --> 02:25:26,273
our conservative government or previous 
conservative government tried really 

2952
02:25:29,501 --> 02:25:33,660
hard to get rid of that.
Um hmm.

2953
02:25:34,450 --> 02:25:35,201
Interesting.
Well,

2954
02:25:35,201 --> 02:25:36,250
listen,
it's a,

2955
02:25:36,260 --> 02:25:39,550
it's fascinating to me because you took 
sort of a theme,

2956
02:25:39,840 --> 02:25:41,890
uh,
related to,

2957
02:25:41,950 --> 02:25:42,783
you know,
political correctness and this 

2958
02:25:44,281 --> 02:25:45,114
depression stuff and all that and 
applied it to something that we haven't 

2959
02:25:47,021 --> 02:25:47,854
talked about that much,
so I really appreciate your thoughts on 

2960
02:25:49,091 --> 02:25:49,751
it.
All right,

2961
02:25:49,751 --> 02:25:52,210
I'm on with john.
Marco in Switzerland.

2962
02:25:52,330 --> 02:25:54,130
Has it going on in Switzerland right 
now?

2963
02:25:54,610 --> 02:25:55,990
Eight,
eight a.

2964
02:25:56,230 --> 02:25:59,290
It's good.
It's evening and yeah,

2965
02:25:59,860 --> 02:26:01,450
I just waiting for your call here.

2966
02:26:01,650 --> 02:26:03,720
Yeah,
I got a guy with better hair than me.

2967
02:26:03,721 --> 02:26:04,554
This is very upsetting,
but we're gonna we're gonna do it 

2968
02:26:07,741 --> 02:26:08,431
anyway.
All right.

2969
02:26:08,431 --> 02:26:09,264
So one of the things you wanted to talk 
about was sort of coming out as an 

2970
02:26:12,511 --> 02:26:13,344
atheist,
which I think is really interesting and 

2971
02:26:15,031 --> 02:26:18,300
it's one of the things we've talked 
about here that people feel this need to

2972
02:26:18,330 --> 02:26:19,163
make this proclamation.
So can you tell me a little bit about 

2973
02:26:21,211 --> 02:26:22,044
your journey?

2974
02:26:22,710 --> 02:26:23,031
Uh,
yeah,

2975
02:26:23,031 --> 02:26:24,680
sure.
Um,

2976
02:26:24,860 --> 02:26:29,600
well I was born and raised in 
Switzerland,

2977
02:26:30,020 --> 02:26:34,670
so it's not a religious country,
it's just like,

2978
02:26:34,671 --> 02:26:35,870
yeah.
Um,

2979
02:26:35,890 --> 02:26:39,120
I had some,
some religion classes in,

2980
02:26:39,130 --> 02:26:42,890
in primary and stuff,
but I wasn't ever really religious.

2981
02:26:43,560 --> 02:26:45,440
I'm catholic.
Was a catholic classes?

2982
02:26:45,830 --> 02:26:47,900
No,
it was evangelical.

2983
02:26:48,050 --> 02:26:50,340
Okay.
And um,

2984
02:26:51,290 --> 02:26:52,123
yeah,
then I went to sydney for exchange 

2985
02:26:55,011 --> 02:26:56,710
semester,
um,

2986
02:26:57,230 --> 02:26:59,600
when I was like 18,
19,

2987
02:27:00,380 --> 02:27:03,530
and I stumbled upon this,
this,

2988
02:27:03,720 --> 02:27:07,550
uh,
debates have ken hamm against,

2989
02:27:08,530 --> 02:27:11,200
uh,
um,

2990
02:27:11,360 --> 02:27:11,871
yeah.
So,

2991
02:27:11,871 --> 02:27:16,871
and I would like to say the least.
I thought it was ridiculous that,

2992
02:27:17,171 --> 02:27:20,770
that some people would think that weight
like ken hemi was.

2993
02:27:21,060 --> 02:27:23,250
So basically for people that don't know,
he's the,

2994
02:27:23,310 --> 02:27:24,143
he's the guy that runs the board at the 
biblical park somewhere in America and 

2995
02:27:28,831 --> 02:27:32,760
he debated bill nye about evolution 
versus creation.

2996
02:27:32,761 --> 02:27:33,000
Yeah,
yeah,

2997
02:27:33,000 --> 02:27:34,090
yeah,
exactly.

2998
02:27:34,290 --> 02:27:38,580
Yeah.
So I was like a bit confused and,

2999
02:27:38,581 --> 02:27:40,570
and,
um,

3000
02:27:40,780 --> 02:27:41,613
yeah,
told my brother and he was a little bit 

3001
02:27:43,151 --> 02:27:48,151
more into that and then she showed me 
christopher hitchens and richard dawkins

3002
02:27:49,660 --> 02:27:53,180
and I felt it would be good english 
lesson to,

3003
02:27:53,200 --> 02:27:56,650
to read those books.
Like god is not great.

3004
02:27:57,430 --> 02:28:00,130
And then,
so yeah,

3005
02:28:01,720 --> 02:28:02,553
I felt that I was,
I was talking to some people there 

3006
02:28:04,511 --> 02:28:05,344
because I had connections to everywhere 
in the world because like I had some 

3007
02:28:09,341 --> 02:28:11,440
people from,
from sheila,

3008
02:28:11,441 --> 02:28:13,300
they're from Switzerland,
from Belgium,

3009
02:28:13,301 --> 02:28:18,130
from everywhere.
So what does donald me the most was this

3010
02:28:18,131 --> 02:28:18,964
guy from Switzerland actually who was 
like while I believe in creationism and 

3011
02:28:26,270 --> 02:28:27,160
I was like,
just,

3012
02:28:27,590 --> 02:28:30,270
it was a swiss guy like me.
What's,

3013
02:28:30,370 --> 02:28:34,740
what's thinking that,
that like noah's ark really was just,

3014
02:28:35,090 --> 02:28:37,970
it was just mind blowing for me.
Um,

3015
02:28:38,030 --> 02:28:38,863
so I started to,
to watch debates on youtube and stuff 

3016
02:28:42,230 --> 02:28:43,063
and yeah,
when I came home I was like full blown 

3017
02:28:46,370 --> 02:28:47,203
atheist.

3018
02:28:49,180 --> 02:28:53,580
It sounds to me that you deal with 
exactly what most atheists deal with,

3019
02:28:53,581 --> 02:28:56,370
which is that it's not actually that big
of a deal,

3020
02:28:56,371 --> 02:28:57,204
but you feel like you have to sort of 
say it because otherwise the world just 

3021
02:29:01,231 --> 02:29:02,910
thinks you believe something that you 
don't.

3022
02:29:03,720 --> 02:29:04,310
Yeah.
Right,

3023
02:29:04,310 --> 02:29:05,650
right.
It's like that.

3024
02:29:05,980 --> 02:29:08,290
And like when I,
when I discovered this,

3025
02:29:08,320 --> 02:29:09,550
all of this,
I was,

3026
02:29:09,630 --> 02:29:13,260
I wasn't a little bit more militant.
I don't know how to say like,

3027
02:29:13,320 --> 02:29:14,153
sure.
I thought people who believe this stuff 

3028
02:29:17,890 --> 02:29:18,723
will be lazy or stupid or not really 
stupid but like ignorant and kind of 

3029
02:29:23,531 --> 02:29:26,740
weird.
So I got a little bit out of that.

3030
02:29:26,860 --> 02:29:29,350
I let them have their beliefs and 
whatever.

3031
02:29:29,580 --> 02:29:30,690
Um.
Yeah.

3032
02:29:30,700 --> 02:29:34,450
But I need,
I feel need to tell that I don't believe

3033
02:29:34,451 --> 02:29:35,284
that.

3034
02:29:37,170 --> 02:29:37,591
Yeah.
Well,

3035
02:29:37,591 --> 02:29:40,680
it's funny because I always say to me,
I don't care what you believe as long as

3036
02:29:40,681 --> 02:29:43,230
you're not trying to chop my head off or
making me believe anything else,

3037
02:29:43,231 --> 02:29:45,930
then you go ahead and believe whatever 
you want,

3038
02:29:45,931 --> 02:29:46,840
you know?
Um.

3039
02:29:47,360 --> 02:29:48,193
All right.
So one of the things that you wrote in 

3040
02:29:49,261 --> 02:29:50,094
that you want to talk about that I 
thought was really interesting was that 

3041
02:29:52,081 --> 02:29:52,914
you want to talk about the difference 
between the us constitution and the 

3042
02:29:55,981 --> 02:29:59,610
swiss constitution and that basically 
you think that we're a.

3043
02:29:59,611 --> 02:30:00,860
Don't worry about the hair,
that,

3044
02:30:01,200 --> 02:30:02,033
that we,
that we are sort of obsessed with never 

3045
02:30:05,011 --> 02:30:05,844
changing our constitution,
but you guys actually change your 

3046
02:30:08,341 --> 02:30:09,960
constitution pretty frequently,
right?

3047
02:30:10,620 --> 02:30:12,230
Yeah,
it was.

3048
02:30:12,240 --> 02:30:13,073
It wasn't like a debate about gun 
regulation under the second amendment 

3049
02:30:18,060 --> 02:30:21,110
United States,
and I thought to myself lIke,

3050
02:30:22,260 --> 02:30:23,093
why wouldn't they allow to change that 
like inside oldest lobbying and stuff 

3051
02:30:28,231 --> 02:30:29,064
from the nra,
a gallup poll that like 55 percent of 

3052
02:30:34,301 --> 02:30:38,820
the american people are for,
I'm more strict can regulation.

3053
02:30:39,630 --> 02:30:44,630
So I looked into it a little bit more 
and what I found was,

3054
02:30:46,030 --> 02:30:49,950
was pretty astonishing to me.
I've always thought like,

3055
02:30:50,790 --> 02:30:52,830
uh,
the american constitution is kinda,

3056
02:30:52,831 --> 02:30:54,060
it's kinda,
um,

3057
02:30:54,780 --> 02:30:55,613
static and,
and just for 230 years it was almost a 

3058
02:31:01,411 --> 02:31:05,490
safe and swiss constitution as you may 
know,

3059
02:31:05,640 --> 02:31:06,473
we have referendums like four times a 
year where people just sending some 

3060
02:31:10,801 --> 02:31:11,634
ideas and we vote on it.
And thiS is like changing the 

3061
02:31:15,451 --> 02:31:16,860
constitution every time.

3062
02:31:17,020 --> 02:31:17,853
Wait,
did you say you guys do that four times 

3063
02:31:18,821 --> 02:31:19,654
a year?

3064
02:31:19,870 --> 02:31:20,670
Yeah,

3065
02:31:20,670 --> 02:31:21,540
man,
that's a lot.

3066
02:31:21,630 --> 02:31:22,463
And people show up and vote four times a
year and actually change the 

3067
02:31:25,141 --> 02:31:26,430
constitution that often.

3068
02:31:27,050 --> 02:31:27,571
Yeah.
Yeah,

3069
02:31:27,571 --> 02:31:28,900
it is.
Well,

3070
02:31:29,080 --> 02:31:33,870
we had like 50,
55 percent of the people at both.

3071
02:31:34,510 --> 02:31:36,450
Um,
the rest is just like,

3072
02:31:36,451 --> 02:31:38,310
yeah,
well do whatever you want.

3073
02:31:40,030 --> 02:31:41,220
And uh,
yeah,

3074
02:31:41,221 --> 02:31:42,054
but we won't like for 12 or 12 to 15 
different referendum each year in force 

3075
02:31:51,160 --> 02:31:51,860
steps.

3076
02:31:51,860 --> 02:31:52,431
Yeah.
So.

3077
02:31:52,431 --> 02:31:53,264
all right.
So have you seen any gimme gimme like 

3078
02:31:54,770 --> 02:31:55,603
one good example of that,
like something that you guys have 

3079
02:31:57,141 --> 02:32:00,050
changed for the better and one time that
maybe it didn't work if you can think of

3080
02:32:00,051 --> 02:32:00,884
something?

3081
02:32:01,340 --> 02:32:02,173
Yeah,
sure.

3082
02:32:03,970 --> 02:32:07,970
TwO thousand and 10.
I think it was um,

3083
02:32:08,310 --> 02:32:11,510
like the,
the far right party of Switzerland,

3084
02:32:11,520 --> 02:32:16,520
the svp proposed that we should ban 
minarets,

3085
02:32:17,360 --> 02:32:21,440
like the towers on the mosques of the.
Yeah.

3086
02:32:22,200 --> 02:32:24,750
So,
and it was accepted by the people.

3087
02:32:25,230 --> 02:32:26,063
So now we have in our constitution our 
article like 72 that it's prohibited to 

3088
02:32:33,600 --> 02:32:38,600
build minerals like when we have like 
two little ends.

3089
02:32:39,620 --> 02:32:41,130
So it was like no issue at all.

3090
02:32:41,170 --> 02:32:42,003
Right.
So it wasn't really a problem but the 

3091
02:32:42,901 --> 02:32:44,040
far right grabbed it.
Yeah.

3092
02:32:44,160 --> 02:32:45,980
Yeah,
it was just like sinophobia,

3093
02:32:46,860 --> 02:32:48,350
populistic and.
Yeah.

3094
02:32:49,140 --> 02:32:54,140
And the good thing we accepted,
I really need to finish,

3095
02:32:56,530 --> 02:33:01,530
but it's like most things are good that 
they're not accepted,

3096
02:33:03,030 --> 02:33:04,770
that we have some,
some,

3097
02:33:05,430 --> 02:33:10,430
like all these proposals are,
are either far right or far left like a.

3098
02:33:11,640 --> 02:33:12,473
Yeah,
like minimum wages and I mean that's 

3099
02:33:15,990 --> 02:33:16,823
kind of okay.
But minimum wages were like set to $22 

3100
02:33:20,850 --> 02:33:24,300
per hour and that's just ridiculous 
high.

3101
02:33:24,390 --> 02:33:25,800
I mean,
who would pay that?

3102
02:33:25,960 --> 02:33:26,793
right?
So does that ultimately hurt the swiss 

3103
02:33:28,571 --> 02:33:29,404
economy?
I mean the businesses then leave 

3104
02:33:30,341 --> 02:33:31,174
Switzerland because it sounds like 
Switzerland and we always think of it 

3105
02:33:32,501 --> 02:33:32,741
as,
oh,

3106
02:33:32,741 --> 02:33:34,450
they have so much money.
Everybody's so happy.

3107
02:33:34,451 --> 02:33:35,284
It's so great.

3108
02:33:36,210 --> 02:33:36,631
Yeah.
No,

3109
02:33:36,631 --> 02:33:37,441
I,
I think so.

3110
02:33:37,441 --> 02:33:38,280
Yeah.
what I'm,

3111
02:33:38,281 --> 02:33:39,114
I'm not an economist,
but from what I've heard and what I've 

3112
02:33:42,871 --> 02:33:43,704
read,
I think it will really hurt the country 

3113
02:33:46,561 --> 02:33:47,230
as,
as a,

3114
02:33:47,230 --> 02:33:51,290
as a financial spot and,
and yeah.

3115
02:33:51,600 --> 02:33:53,130
And also,
yeah.

3116
02:33:53,650 --> 02:33:55,330
So the other thIng that you wanted to 
talk about,

3117
02:33:55,331 --> 02:33:58,060
which is one of the things that almost 
everyone in europe,

3118
02:33:58,061 --> 02:33:58,894
especially his wanted to talk to me 
about is the refugee situation and 

3119
02:34:02,411 --> 02:34:04,320
political correctness.
Uh,

3120
02:34:04,330 --> 02:34:05,350
so I'll let you go from there.

3121
02:34:06,280 --> 02:34:08,250
Yeah.
So um,

3122
02:34:09,040 --> 02:34:10,410
refugee crisis in,
in,

3123
02:34:10,411 --> 02:34:15,411
in Switzerland itself.
I mean I'm not that I'm on top of like,

3124
02:34:16,310 --> 02:34:20,900
like the whole situation.
I know where you stand on the balcony

3125
02:34:21,480 --> 02:34:22,320
stuff.
Don't worry.

3126
02:34:22,321 --> 02:34:23,730
I'm not going to quiz you on everything.
We're just,

3127
02:34:23,760 --> 02:34:24,750
we're just getting your opinion.

3128
02:34:25,420 --> 02:34:26,253
Okay.
Okay.

3129
02:34:26,330 --> 02:34:26,971
So yeah,
I'm,

3130
02:34:26,971 --> 02:34:31,971
I'm basically for a like letting 
refugees in like,

3131
02:34:32,240 --> 02:34:34,250
I mean we're all humans.
We should,

3132
02:34:34,310 --> 02:34:37,370
we should get along with each other and 
help each other.

3133
02:34:37,680 --> 02:34:41,870
That's like human humanitarian aspect of
it.

3134
02:34:42,140 --> 02:34:46,430
But like the left is,
is pushing like these,

3135
02:34:46,431 --> 02:34:51,431
these ideas or these reasons to let them
in a like for example,

3136
02:34:52,821 --> 02:34:57,440
when when someone says just like 
something a little bit,

3137
02:34:58,430 --> 02:35:03,430
I don't know,
let's say a controversial about refugees

3138
02:35:04,731 --> 02:35:05,150
and,
and,

3139
02:35:05,150 --> 02:35:07,850
and yeah,
and what they're doing.

3140
02:35:08,420 --> 02:35:13,420
It's just like it Down and then you 
cannot talk probably about,

3141
02:35:15,471 --> 02:35:19,280
about what the issue is with the 
refugees that come in.

3142
02:35:19,550 --> 02:35:20,383
I mean I'm all for letting them in but 
we have to talk about the issues that 

3143
02:35:25,760 --> 02:35:28,980
are coming through us with this and 
yeah,

3144
02:35:29,000 --> 02:35:31,920
they're just saying that or.
Yeah,

3145
02:35:32,150 --> 02:35:32,983
saying no,
there are no problems at all with this 

3146
02:35:35,721 --> 02:35:40,721
or like maybe a little bit financial but
nothing really cultural or.

3147
02:35:41,450 --> 02:35:42,283
Yeah,

3148
02:35:42,690 --> 02:35:43,523
listen,
that's exactly why I'm talking about on 

3149
02:35:44,880 --> 02:35:46,980
the show because we got to have these 
conversations.

3150
02:35:47,250 --> 02:35:48,360
Listen,
that was quick,

3151
02:35:48,450 --> 02:35:51,310
but it was a pleasure talking to you and
thank you.

3152
02:35:51,720 --> 02:35:53,790
All right.
I'm on with adam in Sweden.

3153
02:35:53,791 --> 02:35:54,690
Adam,
has it gone?

3154
02:35:55,530 --> 02:35:59,460
It's going just fine.
Actually a great reporter to this.

3155
02:35:59,670 --> 02:36:00,780
Cool.
Well me too.

3156
02:36:00,840 --> 02:36:01,480
Uh,
so,

3157
02:36:01,480 --> 02:36:02,313
you know,
I've mentioned a lot about Sweden and 

3158
02:36:03,121 --> 02:36:03,954
just recently I had a tino sign and 
dodgy on the show who's an economist 

3159
02:36:08,251 --> 02:36:09,084
from Sweden and one of the few people 
that will talk about the political 

3160
02:36:12,061 --> 02:36:12,894
correct situation and sort of this 
regressive ideology that seems to have 

3161
02:36:16,411 --> 02:36:17,244
taken hold in Sweden.
And I got a Lot of messages from Sweden 

3162
02:36:19,801 --> 02:36:21,530
talking about that.
Uh,

3163
02:36:21,580 --> 02:36:24,750
and you were the one we went with.
So we expect you to represent your,

3164
02:36:24,810 --> 02:36:25,680
your whole country.

3165
02:36:25,990 --> 02:36:27,910
Here we go.
Oh boy.

3166
02:36:27,911 --> 02:36:28,744
I'm the most honest swedish.
We could find a good representation 

3167
02:36:32,081 --> 02:36:32,914
there.

3168
02:36:33,210 --> 02:36:33,901
Well,
as you know,

3169
02:36:33,901 --> 02:36:35,580
I believe that it's about the 
individual,

3170
02:36:35,581 --> 02:36:37,450
not about the,
the bigger group.

3171
02:36:37,451 --> 02:36:38,284
So let's start with that.
So one of the things you wanted to talk 

3172
02:36:40,081 --> 02:36:40,914
about was that the political correct,
this seeping ideology and what it's 

3173
02:36:45,661 --> 02:36:48,060
doing to society in Sweden.
So let's start with that.

3174
02:36:50,160 --> 02:36:50,990
Well,
uh,

3175
02:36:50,990 --> 02:36:55,420
I've been doing explain this because 
it's,

3176
02:36:55,421 --> 02:36:56,254
it's fairly hard really,
since you need so much context for it 

3177
02:36:59,450 --> 02:37:01,010
and we have so little time for it.
Yes,

3178
02:37:02,810 --> 02:37:04,040
we'll do the best you can.

3179
02:37:05,720 --> 02:37:08,140
I'll just save it.
It goes back at least a hundred years.

3180
02:37:09,640 --> 02:37:13,810
Started with the socialism and 
everything like that in Sweden.

3181
02:37:14,260 --> 02:37:17,900
I'm,
but in the modern era at least since the

3182
02:37:17,900 --> 02:37:18,890
seventies.
Um,

3183
02:37:19,220 --> 02:37:24,220
Sweden was a hotbed for very radical 
leftism in the seventies.

3184
02:37:24,800 --> 02:37:26,970
Um,
we even had,

3185
02:37:26,971 --> 02:37:27,804
um,
left this terrorist and everything like 

3186
02:37:29,121 --> 02:37:34,121
that in the Sweden that occupied and the
east and the west german and Scott West,

3187
02:37:35,931 --> 02:37:40,070
german embassy.
And so it has a long tradition,

3188
02:37:42,450 --> 02:37:45,150
but the biggest things I actually want 
to explain what this,

3189
02:37:45,180 --> 02:37:46,013
that explains how Sweden works today is 
two terms and I think I've translated 

3190
02:37:51,121 --> 02:37:56,121
them reasonably.
One is called the opinion corridor and I

3191
02:37:56,221 --> 02:37:59,580
think that's kind of self explanatory,
but I'll give an explanation that it's,

3192
02:38:00,180 --> 02:38:02,850
um,
that is in Sweden.

3193
02:38:03,000 --> 02:38:05,640
There's a very narrow corridor of 
opinions.

3194
02:38:05,641 --> 02:38:07,770
We're allowed to have it arrest.
Well,

3195
02:38:07,771 --> 02:38:09,390
if you have only opinion outside of 
that,

3196
02:38:09,391 --> 02:38:10,570
like me,
you're a nazi,

3197
02:38:10,571 --> 02:38:12,020
you're a racist,
you're big attend,

3198
02:38:12,280 --> 02:38:13,440
you know,
you're all of that

3199
02:38:14,460 --> 02:38:17,540
nazi or racist or bigoted.
Let's just get that out.

3200
02:38:18,850 --> 02:38:23,200
I'm neither of those.
I may be very arian,

3201
02:38:23,201 --> 02:38:26,120
but I'm not a nazi.
And,

3202
02:38:27,340 --> 02:38:28,173
and events opinion corridor for my 
entire lifetime has just been narrowing 

3203
02:38:33,080 --> 02:38:33,913
and,
and I would definitely say that it 

3204
02:38:35,411 --> 02:38:39,490
narrowed its most when obama became a 
president.

3205
02:38:39,760 --> 02:38:41,390
Really?
Yeah.

3206
02:38:41,470 --> 02:38:46,470
I would say in Sweden,
The last I'd say two decades I guess has

3207
02:38:47,441 --> 02:38:49,900
tried to emulate America and all its 
worst parts.

3208
02:38:50,500 --> 02:38:54,250
And so we always had this opinion 
corridor,

3209
02:38:54,790 --> 02:38:55,623
but then we saw how you guys started 
going with the political correctness 

3210
02:38:58,241 --> 02:39:02,650
part and then it just went worse.
So,

3211
02:39:03,730 --> 02:39:04,563
and

3212
02:39:05,740 --> 02:39:07,420
yeah,
I think that explains that part.

3213
02:39:07,990 --> 02:39:11,740
Then we also have another term that we 
didn't advance,

3214
02:39:11,830 --> 02:39:12,663
but a swedish political commentator in 
the seventies put two coin very well is 

3215
02:39:17,470 --> 02:39:18,303
called veal hellman move battery.
And I would recommend reading up about 

3216
02:39:21,011 --> 02:39:21,844
him because he will give a lot of 
contexts that are bullshit that's going 

3217
02:39:23,531 --> 02:39:25,090
on today.
Um,

3218
02:39:25,420 --> 02:39:28,420
and I think I'll try to pronounce this 
demo creatorship he called it,

3219
02:39:29,380 --> 02:39:30,213
um,
combination of the word democracy and 

3220
02:39:32,051 --> 02:39:32,884
dictatorship right now that works 
essentially in that we have a formal 

3221
02:39:38,141 --> 02:39:39,850
democracy,
um,

3222
02:39:40,270 --> 02:39:41,103
but on the best of the,
of the cultural force that our 

3223
02:39:44,081 --> 02:39:46,330
government represents,
um,

3224
02:39:46,660 --> 02:39:47,493
we haven't enforced dictatorship of 
sorts in the form of the cultural on 

3225
02:39:51,631 --> 02:39:52,464
the,
in Sweden that know has its expression 

3226
02:39:55,001 --> 02:39:57,270
in the,
uh,

3227
02:39:57,280 --> 02:39:58,390
in the opinion corridor,

3228
02:39:59,020 --> 02:39:59,853
right?
So what you're talking about basically 

3229
02:40:00,671 --> 02:40:02,380
is as we,
we've used this phrase,

3230
02:40:02,381 --> 02:40:05,290
the oppression olympics,
you guys are really big on this,

3231
02:40:05,291 --> 02:40:06,124
that depending on who you are and where 
you're from and your religion and your 

3232
02:40:09,311 --> 02:40:12,550
skin color,
we really put you in this pecking order,

3233
02:40:12,551 --> 02:40:13,380
right?

3234
02:40:13,380 --> 02:40:13,900
Absolutely.

3235
02:40:13,900 --> 02:40:15,930
And you were baSically,
you were very much a home,

3236
02:40:16,020 --> 02:40:19,510
a home homogenous society.
And now that's really changing,

3237
02:40:19,511 --> 02:40:21,350
so the pecking order starts getting you 
back.

3238
02:40:21,490 --> 02:40:24,910
We were a very homogenous society on 
film until at least the nineties.

3239
02:40:26,050 --> 02:40:29,920
That's when the balkan wars erupted on 
the other genocide.

3240
02:40:29,921 --> 02:40:31,810
And I'm doing that and we got a lot of 
refugees from that.

3241
02:40:32,290 --> 02:40:33,970
Um,
they've Integrated mostly.

3242
02:40:33,971 --> 02:40:34,804
well,
we didn't really get the problems until 

3243
02:40:36,011 --> 02:40:40,780
we have the very large immigration from 
the middle east.

3244
02:40:41,200 --> 02:40:42,033
Uh,
it's easier to integrate a european 

3245
02:40:42,911 --> 02:40:43,744
culture than a completely foreign 
culture from an entire different parts 

3246
02:40:46,091 --> 02:40:47,950
of the world with different cultural 
context and all of that.

3247
02:40:48,690 --> 02:40:49,523
Um,

3248
02:40:50,290 --> 02:40:53,140
but I'm sayinG that would label you are 
racist,

3249
02:40:53,141 --> 02:40:54,310
right?
Absolutely right.

3250
02:40:54,990 --> 02:40:59,990
I'm definitely a racist for sayinG that.
Um,

3251
02:41:01,160 --> 02:41:03,190
so,
so the problem is because that's outside

3252
02:41:03,191 --> 02:41:04,024
of the opinion courtyard,
we can talk openly about it and that's 

3253
02:41:07,351 --> 02:41:09,830
cost all a lot of issues.
And

3254
02:41:10,000 --> 02:41:10,990
yEah.
So that leads,

3255
02:41:11,080 --> 02:41:13,510
that leads directly to the other thing 
that you want to talk about,

3256
02:41:13,860 --> 02:41:15,330
especially at.
Exactly.

3257
02:41:15,331 --> 02:41:16,290
I mean,
yeah,

3258
02:41:16,690 --> 02:41:18,250
it leads to the other thing you want to 
talk about,

3259
02:41:18,251 --> 02:41:20,140
which is the rise of the right in 
Sweden,

3260
02:41:20,141 --> 02:41:22,090
which is a new phenomenon.
So can you lay that out?

3261
02:41:22,690 --> 02:41:23,700
Um,
yeah,

3262
02:41:23,701 --> 02:41:24,534
it's,
it's a new phenomenon because in Sweden 

3263
02:41:26,010 --> 02:41:28,860
the left has essentially ruled as post 
world war two,

3264
02:41:29,330 --> 02:41:30,163
uh,
for 60 years we had one party dominant 

3265
02:41:32,941 --> 02:41:35,160
in our,
what's it called?

3266
02:41:35,280 --> 02:41:36,113
And parliament for 60 years we had the 
social democrats completely dominant in 

3267
02:41:40,231 --> 02:41:41,520
the parliament.
Uh,

3268
02:41:42,060 --> 02:41:44,220
only one the interruption for four 
years.

3269
02:41:46,610 --> 02:41:47,443
And that's kind of when I look about it,
I'm a student of history so I can see 

3270
02:41:51,491 --> 02:41:53,310
the negative side of it is absolutely 
insane.

3271
02:41:53,311 --> 02:41:58,311
Does he just have one party that they 
did achieve some pretty good things.

3272
02:41:58,501 --> 02:42:01,020
The things we called full kemeten to 
Sweden or welfare states,

3273
02:42:01,050 --> 02:42:05,070
they did achieve that,
but they also dismantled it and so,

3274
02:42:05,990 --> 02:42:06,823
but the right has risen because we can't
speak about these things and they are 

3275
02:42:09,500 --> 02:42:12,670
the only ones that had the balls to 
speak about it because,

3276
02:42:13,290 --> 02:42:16,140
well,
the extreme part world or the nazis,

3277
02:42:17,130 --> 02:42:17,963
the less extreme but didn't really care 
to be compared that they were compared 

3278
02:42:20,551 --> 02:42:22,830
with the nazis.
So they just talked about it.

3279
02:42:23,520 --> 02:42:24,353
And now the only way to talk about this 
is to dedicate yourself to being on the 

3280
02:42:28,351 --> 02:42:29,640
far right,
essentIally.

3281
02:42:29,780 --> 02:42:30,613
Yeah.
So we see this happening in America 

3282
02:42:32,271 --> 02:42:33,104
right now and that's why I've been 
talking about it because I see all of 

3283
02:42:35,391 --> 02:42:37,400
you guys,
not just in Sweden but all over europe.

3284
02:42:37,401 --> 02:42:41,150
I see this happening and I'm trying to 
help that not happen here.

3285
02:42:41,450 --> 02:42:42,283
So what does that do for a person?
Like you have a person that is not a 

3286
02:42:45,051 --> 02:42:45,884
nazi and is not a racist and yet you see
a problem with society and only one 

3287
02:42:49,311 --> 02:42:50,570
group talking about it.
where does,

3288
02:42:50,720 --> 02:42:51,740
where does that leave you?

3289
02:42:52,580 --> 02:42:54,380
Completely alone,
essentIally.

3290
02:42:54,850 --> 02:42:56,900
um,
because the left.

3291
02:42:56,930 --> 02:42:59,230
Well they think I'm the great satan 
there.

3292
02:42:59,250 --> 02:43:00,083
Right?
Well I'm also the great satan for them 

3293
02:43:01,671 --> 02:43:02,840
because,
well,

3294
02:43:02,841 --> 02:43:03,674
you know,
I kind of think that brown people or 

3295
02:43:05,241 --> 02:43:06,074
people to and jobs are done like people 
and that's not right according to the 

3296
02:43:10,320 --> 02:43:11,050
four,
right?

3297
02:43:11,050 --> 02:43:11,883
Yeah,
I mean I consider myself an ideological 

3298
02:43:16,840 --> 02:43:17,673
ideologically independent because I 
consider ideologies to be secular 

3299
02:43:20,321 --> 02:43:21,990
religions.
Um,

3300
02:43:22,510 --> 02:43:24,910
so I,
I shy away from those things.

3301
02:43:24,940 --> 02:43:28,950
So it's very hard.
And being of my camp in Sweden,

3302
02:43:28,960 --> 02:43:29,620
which is,
you know,

3303
02:43:29,620 --> 02:43:30,500
liberal essentially,

3304
02:43:31,850 --> 02:43:32,683
that's the whole purpose of this show 
and I almost everyone that I'm talking 

3305
02:43:34,651 --> 02:43:37,350
today talking with today over all over 
the world,

3306
02:43:37,490 --> 02:43:40,050
I mean this is what it's all about.
So just to end this real quick though,

3307
02:43:40,051 --> 02:43:40,884
because we got to go,
you're starting your own youtube 

3308
02:43:42,061 --> 02:43:42,511
channel,
right?

3309
02:43:42,511 --> 02:43:44,700
To get these ideas across.
So where can we send people?

3310
02:43:45,130 --> 02:43:47,770
Uh,
the youtube channel has been slow.

3311
02:43:47,771 --> 02:43:49,720
I ended up taking because I've been 
busy.

3312
02:43:49,810 --> 02:43:52,140
I'm a college student so.
Um,

3313
02:43:52,270 --> 02:43:55,930
but look for the thought criminals 
channel in the near future.

3314
02:43:56,200 --> 02:43:58,150
Alright,
I'm on with michael in Colorado.

3315
02:43:58,151 --> 02:43:59,020
Michael,
how are you?

3316
02:43:59,330 --> 02:44:00,260
Hi dave.
I'm good.

3317
02:44:00,370 --> 02:44:01,370
Good to see you.
Yeah,

3318
02:44:01,490 --> 02:44:03,490
good to see you.
So I have to tell you,

3319
02:44:03,520 --> 02:44:08,050
we picked 20 people at a 1200 and I hope
you take thIs the right way.

3320
02:44:08,051 --> 02:44:09,910
You are the elder statesmen of the 
group.

3321
02:44:10,450 --> 02:44:13,210
Oh boy.
Not to add any extra pressure.

3322
02:44:13,920 --> 02:44:15,730
Okay,
well that'll give me a beer at the local

3323
02:44:15,731 --> 02:44:16,564
bar.
So that's good.

3324
02:44:17,050 --> 02:44:18,850
Absolutely.
So first off,

3325
02:44:18,851 --> 02:44:19,684
you had a really interesting history.
That's one of the reasons why I wanted 

3326
02:44:22,871 --> 02:44:23,820
to talk to you.
Uh,

3327
02:44:23,890 --> 02:44:25,870
and you were in the navy,
so first off,

3328
02:44:25,871 --> 02:44:27,880
tell me when you served,
where you served.

3329
02:44:28,820 --> 02:44:30,200
Um,
I was in the navy.

3330
02:44:30,201 --> 02:44:32,600
I joined and when I was 18 out of high 
school,

3331
02:44:33,000 --> 02:44:33,651
uh,
went in,

3332
02:44:33,651 --> 02:44:35,590
in 1961.
Uh,

3333
02:44:35,840 --> 02:44:37,340
put that in context.
Let's see.

3334
02:44:37,341 --> 02:44:39,770
President kennedy announced the apollo 
program.

3335
02:44:40,330 --> 02:44:44,000
A west side story came out and our 
president,

3336
02:44:44,001 --> 02:44:46,490
barack obama was born when he was in 
diapers.

3337
02:44:46,491 --> 02:44:49,940
I was in bootcamp and I served eight 
years,

3338
02:44:50,870 --> 02:44:53,620
got out In 1969 to go to college.
Uh,

3339
02:44:53,750 --> 02:44:54,583
san diego.
I was on a guided missile destroyer of 

3340
02:44:57,230 --> 02:44:59,390
all over the pacific for awhile,
came back,

3341
02:44:59,391 --> 02:45:04,391
got involved and the polaris submarine 
program and I was stationed in Spain for

3342
02:45:05,001 --> 02:45:05,834
a couple years and then at charleston 
for a couple of years working on some 

3343
02:45:08,180 --> 02:45:09,090
high tech,
you know,

3344
02:45:09,200 --> 02:45:13,070
secret stuff and uh,
said adios to that.

3345
02:45:13,100 --> 02:45:15,740
And uh,
went to school on the gi bill,

3346
02:45:16,160 --> 02:45:20,030
took a degree in anthropology and pretty
much minored in history.

3347
02:45:20,690 --> 02:45:23,060
And then life going on.

3348
02:45:23,280 --> 02:45:24,113
Then life went on.
When you look back at that part of your 

3349
02:45:26,041 --> 02:45:28,860
life to serve as part of your life,
do you think of it fondly?

3350
02:45:28,861 --> 02:45:30,440
Do you,
uh,

3351
02:45:30,540 --> 02:45:32,250
do you miss it?
Anything like that?

3352
02:45:33,000 --> 02:45:34,540
I do think of it finally,
you know,

3353
02:45:34,570 --> 02:45:35,520
distance,
you know,

3354
02:45:35,570 --> 02:45:39,060
mate does make the mind grow a little 
bit more accommodating I think.

3355
02:45:39,300 --> 02:45:41,100
But all,
it was really good for me.

3356
02:45:41,101 --> 02:45:44,220
How it had no idea what I wanted to do 
when I was 18 years old.

3357
02:45:44,221 --> 02:45:46,200
My friends,
many of them are going off to college,

3358
02:45:46,201 --> 02:45:49,160
but I knew I wasn't really ready for 
that somehow.

3359
02:45:49,350 --> 02:45:51,630
Um,
it was good for me in a lot of ways.

3360
02:45:51,750 --> 02:45:53,560
It helped me to grow up,
uh,

3361
02:45:53,660 --> 02:45:54,493
gave me some responsibility now that I 
can handle that gave me the equivalent 

3362
02:45:58,861 --> 02:46:00,930
of a masters degree in electrical 
engineering,

3363
02:46:01,410 --> 02:46:03,270
which was a big help.
But,

3364
02:46:03,290 --> 02:46:04,123
uh,
when I got out I abandoned engineering 

3365
02:46:05,311 --> 02:46:06,144
and went directly into anthropology 
because eight years of engineering is 

3366
02:46:09,470 --> 02:46:10,250
pretty,
uh,

3367
02:46:10,250 --> 02:46:10,850
is enough.

3368
02:46:10,850 --> 02:46:11,683
But I'm pretty sure if my notes serve me
correct that in 1964 before you went to 

3369
02:46:16,221 --> 02:46:17,870
anthropologie,
you built a computer.

3370
02:46:18,600 --> 02:46:18,971
Well,
uh,

3371
02:46:18,971 --> 02:46:19,804
Built and more,
more to the poInt I programmed my first 

3372
02:46:23,130 --> 02:46:28,130
digital computer because when I got into
the polaris program that all the systems

3373
02:46:28,771 --> 02:46:29,604
on the boats,
these are intercontinental ballistic 

3374
02:46:30,781 --> 02:46:33,830
missile systems are run by computers,
uh,

3375
02:46:33,960 --> 02:46:35,760
in 1964,
those computers,

3376
02:46:35,761 --> 02:46:37,860
we're probably not quite as powerful as 
the iphone,

3377
02:46:40,410 --> 02:46:43,440
but I was very fascinated by computers 
still still am.

3378
02:46:43,530 --> 02:46:45,180
Uh,
and as part of my training,

3379
02:46:45,181 --> 02:46:48,630
we put together a little block system of
computers,

3380
02:46:48,840 --> 02:46:52,740
have a digital computer and learn how to
do the basic programming.

3381
02:46:52,741 --> 02:46:54,450
It was all what we call machine 
language.

3382
02:46:54,451 --> 02:46:55,284
It was all ones and zeros.
And then we went to the lab and we 

3383
02:46:57,481 --> 02:46:59,680
started programming where you're going 
on the big guys.

3384
02:46:59,790 --> 02:47:00,623
Nineteen 64.
So that was my introduction to digital 

3385
02:47:02,820 --> 02:47:03,400
computer.

3386
02:47:03,400 --> 02:47:04,420
Yeah.
So that's so cool.

3387
02:47:04,421 --> 02:47:08,140
So 1964,
you're working on the very beginnings of

3388
02:47:08,320 --> 02:47:10,030
a,
of digital computers.

3389
02:47:10,031 --> 02:47:10,471
And he said,
oh,

3390
02:47:10,471 --> 02:47:12,250
the zeroes and ones.
Did you ever.

3391
02:47:12,251 --> 02:47:15,730
Do you remember ever having the glimpse 
of what that could become?

3392
02:47:15,880 --> 02:47:16,713
Did you ever think you could be walking 
around with this thing in your pocket 

3393
02:47:18,791 --> 02:47:19,624
that would be exponentially more 
powerful than everything you were 

3394
02:47:22,361 --> 02:47:23,260
working on at the moment?

3395
02:47:23,720 --> 02:47:24,553
I don't.
I don't think anybody did at the time 

3396
02:47:26,150 --> 02:47:29,820
because it was the beginning of solid 
state to solid state years.

3397
02:47:30,060 --> 02:47:31,820
These things are really big.
Uh,

3398
02:47:31,930 --> 02:47:32,890
they,
they work,

3399
02:47:33,060 --> 02:47:34,560
they were in cabinets,
did,

3400
02:47:35,190 --> 02:47:37,330
was open to et cetera.
uh,

3401
02:47:37,350 --> 02:47:40,860
I remember when the personal computer,
they all chair those dose came out,

3402
02:47:41,240 --> 02:47:42,180
you know,
it was pretty neat.

3403
02:47:42,181 --> 02:47:45,210
You can have one at home,
but hell,

3404
02:47:45,240 --> 02:47:46,073
you know,
digital or ellie lcd watches were the 

3405
02:47:48,601 --> 02:47:49,800
big thing back then.
And,

3406
02:47:49,870 --> 02:47:50,703
and Texas instruments calculators.
Nobody really thought that we'd be able 

3407
02:47:54,631 --> 02:47:58,590
to have an iphone and communicate face 
to face dick tracy,

3408
02:47:58,591 --> 02:48:00,840
like things when I was growing up,
the copies we,

3409
02:48:00,841 --> 02:48:02,520
you know,
we thought that would be pretty cool,

3410
02:48:02,521 --> 02:48:06,690
but whoever thought that the,
the advances will be that fast.

3411
02:48:06,850 --> 02:48:09,040
Yeah.
I remember being at a friend's house.

3412
02:48:09,050 --> 02:48:12,300
He's probably when I was six on a Texas 
instruments computer playing a.

3413
02:48:12,520 --> 02:48:13,353
They had their own version of pac man.
It was like they're ripped off version 

3414
02:48:15,581 --> 02:48:17,560
of pac man.
I thought it was the coolest thing ever.

3415
02:48:17,990 --> 02:48:18,830
Yeah,
yeah.

3416
02:48:19,280 --> 02:48:20,113
Well,
you know,

3417
02:48:20,360 --> 02:48:21,193
there was a book called future shock.
You're probably familiar with years ago 

3418
02:48:23,531 --> 02:48:24,364
in which alvin toffler predicted at 
progress would be so fast that by the 

3419
02:48:28,371 --> 02:48:30,740
time you began to get a little bit 
comfortable,

3420
02:48:30,980 --> 02:48:31,813
the next thing will come along and you'd
be a little bit in shock and you're 

3421
02:48:33,711 --> 02:48:35,090
dealing with that.
The next thing will come to.

3422
02:48:35,091 --> 02:48:35,924
The next thing would come and I think 
that's pretty much where we're at right 

3423
02:48:38,481 --> 02:48:38,740
now.

3424
02:48:38,740 --> 02:48:39,573
It does seem like that,
that the second we get okay with a 

3425
02:48:41,681 --> 02:48:42,514
little bit of the technology or just 
some another app comes out the second 

3426
02:48:45,971 --> 02:48:46,391
year.
Okay,

3427
02:48:46,391 --> 02:48:49,160
with one and then now this one does 
something else and you forget that.

3428
02:48:49,450 --> 02:48:50,860
IT's really.
It's fascinating.

3429
02:48:51,280 --> 02:48:52,450
It is in the.
You know,

3430
02:48:52,451 --> 02:48:55,000
what I find kind of disheartening is a 
lot of people.

3431
02:48:55,001 --> 02:48:58,420
One of the things I do here is I have on
the library board or if I helped some of

3432
02:48:58,421 --> 02:48:59,254
the older retirees here and try to deal 
with their ipad and their iphones and 

3433
02:49:03,491 --> 02:49:04,630
god help them,
their windows,

3434
02:49:04,631 --> 02:49:05,710
computers,
et cetera.

3435
02:49:05,940 --> 02:49:08,130
That must be a trial

3436
02:49:08,130 --> 02:49:09,750
in patients.
It's tough.

3437
02:49:09,840 --> 02:49:10,770
Can you deal,
can I give you.

3438
02:49:10,920 --> 02:49:12,990
Can I give my mom your number?
You can.

3439
02:49:13,230 --> 02:49:14,063
Okay,
good.

3440
02:49:14,280 --> 02:49:16,520
Not a problem.
Um,

3441
02:49:17,310 --> 02:49:18,143
but you know,
I liked a lot of the older people are 

3442
02:49:19,561 --> 02:49:20,394
now understanding that this is actually 
a device that can be used for things 

3443
02:49:23,671 --> 02:49:24,504
like we're doing here and for making 
contact with other people and spreading 

3444
02:49:27,481 --> 02:49:32,160
ideas and getting your ideas out so and 
so you become easier to use.

3445
02:49:32,870 --> 02:49:34,080
You know,
the human sense.

3446
02:49:34,320 --> 02:49:36,570
People are going to look past the 
technology now.

3447
02:49:36,571 --> 02:49:39,390
I have a neighbor who's,
she's 20 years older than me.

3448
02:49:39,510 --> 02:49:41,130
Alright.
So she's 93 years old.

3449
02:49:41,490 --> 02:49:44,160
She has an ipad,
she has her,

3450
02:49:44,220 --> 02:49:48,660
your email and little google things and 
all of that with her ipad.

3451
02:49:48,661 --> 02:49:52,740
And she's quite quite familiar with it.
It's sort of magic to her,

3452
02:49:52,741 --> 02:49:55,560
but she knows how to use it so it puts 
her in touch.

3453
02:49:55,650 --> 02:49:57,090
That's really.
That's pretty cool.

3454
02:49:57,091 --> 02:49:57,924
All right.
Let's shift topics altogether because 

3455
02:49:59,041 --> 02:50:01,350
you gave me a blind submission.
You,

3456
02:50:01,480 --> 02:50:04,110
you are an atheist.
Were you always an atheist?

3457
02:50:04,111 --> 02:50:07,230
When did you decide you are an atheist?
You were an atheist before.

3458
02:50:07,231 --> 02:50:08,580
It was cool.
Now it's cool.

3459
02:50:09,080 --> 02:50:09,701
Yeah.
Yeah.

3460
02:50:09,701 --> 02:50:11,460
Well,
it's a template that is still not cool.

3461
02:50:11,461 --> 02:50:12,294
I can point it to.
We have five churches and for real 

3462
02:50:15,721 --> 02:50:18,960
estate offices in a town of 800.
So think about that for a bit.

3463
02:50:19,020 --> 02:50:20,640
So you're,
you're a real minority.

3464
02:50:20,700 --> 02:50:22,560
You're a minority and a minority right 
there.

3465
02:50:22,910 --> 02:50:23,780
Yeah.
Yeah,

3466
02:50:23,790 --> 02:50:25,030
I am.
Especially here.

3467
02:50:26,370 --> 02:50:27,203
I remember I was thinking about that and
I remember when I was probably five or 

3468
02:50:30,631 --> 02:50:31,464
six and we were living with my 
grandmother going to church sunday 

3469
02:50:35,071 --> 02:50:36,450
mornings,
sunday night,

3470
02:50:36,540 --> 02:50:39,390
wednesday night methodist church,
little north Texas town,

3471
02:50:39,870 --> 02:50:44,870
sitting in sunday school looking out the
window at the tree and the swing.

3472
02:50:45,180 --> 02:50:46,950
And so I'm thinking,
god,

3473
02:50:46,951 --> 02:50:49,860
I'd rather be eating place.
Um,

3474
02:50:50,490 --> 02:50:55,110
I think probably realistically about the
time I figured out santa wasn't real.

3475
02:50:55,470 --> 02:50:58,050
I had the same kind of questions are 
about the stories I'd been,

3476
02:50:58,290 --> 02:51:02,460
I'd been taught.
So for about as long as I can remember,

3477
02:51:02,461 --> 02:51:03,540
I guess.
Yeah.

3478
02:51:03,570 --> 02:51:06,990
So one of the other things you mentioned
is that you're,

3479
02:51:07,100 --> 02:51:12,100
you're sort of fascinated by how a 
christians and and just religious people

3480
02:51:12,631 --> 02:51:15,360
in general are often deceived by their 
sources.

3481
02:51:15,361 --> 02:51:18,900
So it's not even necessarily the source 
itself,

3482
02:51:18,901 --> 02:51:21,060
right?
It's not necessarily the book itself,

3483
02:51:21,090 --> 02:51:25,230
but it's sort of the messengers that are
the deceivers am I getting what you said

3484
02:51:25,560 --> 02:51:27,960
correctly?
I think it's both those things,

3485
02:51:28,050 --> 02:51:29,160
um,
you know,

3486
02:51:29,161 --> 02:51:31,440
if you look at abrahamic religions 
today,

3487
02:51:31,800 --> 02:51:32,633
they don't have what we consider to be 
basic hardcore evidence for their 

3488
02:51:36,061 --> 02:51:36,894
claims.
The only thing they have a for a source 

3489
02:51:39,870 --> 02:51:40,703
or books that stem out of oral 
traditions that stem out in ancient 

3490
02:51:44,341 --> 02:51:45,174
manuscripts that had been copied and 
recopied and copied and changed and 

3491
02:51:48,091 --> 02:51:48,924
different.

3492
02:51:48,990 --> 02:51:53,990
So I think there's a problem because the
people who are there pastors and who are

3493
02:51:56,731 --> 02:51:57,564
their priest and go to divinity school,
they understand the history of their 

3494
02:52:00,931 --> 02:52:03,120
religion,
they know the questions involved,

3495
02:52:03,121 --> 02:52:03,954
they know the contradictions,
they know that a lot of this is really 

3496
02:52:06,581 --> 02:52:07,414
false,
but they don't tell that to their 

3497
02:52:09,131 --> 02:52:09,964
congregations.
So the people who hear this really have 

3498
02:52:13,031 --> 02:52:17,350
no independent way of judging whether 
this is real or not.

3499
02:52:17,351 --> 02:52:20,470
So if I have a book,
somebody giving me a book and says,

3500
02:52:20,471 --> 02:52:21,610
look,
this is reality.

3501
02:52:22,240 --> 02:52:24,760
I have some questions.
well where it come from,

3502
02:52:25,510 --> 02:52:27,130
what does it say?
How do we know?

3503
02:52:27,131 --> 02:52:28,670
What it says is true,
etc.

3504
02:52:28,720 --> 02:52:32,530
So digging back into those sources and 
being able to come up with what we think

3505
02:52:32,531 --> 02:52:33,364
are historically realistic stories about
all of this helps people to be a little 

3506
02:52:37,601 --> 02:52:41,980
bit more critical and judge the things 
that they just take on faith.

3507
02:52:42,230 --> 02:52:44,630
Yeah.
So one of the things when I've talked to

3508
02:52:44,631 --> 02:52:45,464
other atheists,
and when I talk about atheism in 

3509
02:52:47,121 --> 02:52:47,954
general,
one of the questions I get is people 

3510
02:52:50,001 --> 02:52:50,241
say,
well,

3511
02:52:50,241 --> 02:52:52,250
how do you have a moral center?
Then?

3512
02:52:52,430 --> 02:52:56,630
How were you able to have a code that 
you live by without religion?

3513
02:52:56,631 --> 02:52:59,090
I think you're laughing already.
sorta gave away your answer,

3514
02:52:59,270 --> 02:53:00,880
but tell me how have you.
How have,

3515
02:53:00,881 --> 02:53:04,190
what have you based your moral center 
on?

3516
02:53:05,180 --> 02:53:07,310
What do I base my moral center on?
Well,

3517
02:53:07,311 --> 02:53:11,150
like I tell you know,
we have two adopted kids there.

3518
02:53:11,180 --> 02:53:12,013
They're adults these days and they're 
doing quite well and one of the reasons 

3519
02:53:15,051 --> 02:53:18,890
that they're doing well is because they 
know what's right and what's not right.

3520
02:53:19,280 --> 02:53:20,113
You have this.
I think humans have this inherent 

3521
02:53:24,110 --> 02:53:28,070
ability to to understand that the right 
way to act,

3522
02:53:28,071 --> 02:53:28,904
for example,
is the way you act when nobody is 

3523
02:53:30,530 --> 02:53:31,363
watching you.
You come out of this feeling of 

3524
02:53:33,770 --> 02:53:34,603
compassion for other people.
You come out of this feeling of being 

3525
02:53:37,011 --> 02:53:40,470
able to help other people and to be 
basically a good person.

3526
02:53:40,490 --> 02:53:45,490
I mean sociopath's aside are normally 
constructed human being,

3527
02:53:45,830 --> 02:53:48,590
you know,
I feel that you understand this.

3528
02:53:48,591 --> 02:53:50,330
I mean the greeks,
I understood it,

3529
02:53:50,331 --> 02:53:53,630
the romans understood it.
The plains indians understood it,

3530
02:53:53,930 --> 02:53:54,763
right?
They,

3531
02:53:54,920 --> 02:53:58,000
they are all allied to different 
religious system,

3532
02:53:58,001 --> 02:53:58,834
so it's not an.
It's not something out of a religious 

3533
02:54:01,430 --> 02:54:04,880
tradition or a book that says follow 
these rules.

3534
02:54:05,480 --> 02:54:06,620
I mean,
you know,

3535
02:54:06,621 --> 02:54:09,860
it's wrong if you kill somebody in 
murder,

3536
02:54:09,861 --> 02:54:12,590
for example,
that's just human basic wrong.

3537
02:54:12,980 --> 02:54:13,813
And I don't think it takes an ancient 
book and dictates from when the guy in 

3538
02:54:17,961 --> 02:54:20,450
the sky to say no,
do this and you're in trouble.

3539
02:54:20,560 --> 02:54:21,610
Yeah.
And if it does,

3540
02:54:21,611 --> 02:54:24,190
there's probably a bigger problem.
There's a bigger problem,

3541
02:54:24,420 --> 02:54:25,211
a bigger problem.
All right?

3542
02:54:25,211 --> 02:54:25,720
So,
uh,

3543
02:54:25,720 --> 02:54:28,060
unfortunately have to wrap it up but let
people know.

3544
02:54:28,240 --> 02:54:29,470
Uh,
so you're working on a book.

3545
02:54:29,471 --> 02:54:30,700
Correct.
And you have a website.

3546
02:54:30,701 --> 02:54:32,020
So where,
where can we send people?

3547
02:54:32,630 --> 02:54:34,460
You can send people.
I have a book.

3548
02:54:34,461 --> 02:54:37,190
It's already I self published it on 
amazon.

3549
02:54:37,250 --> 02:54:39,740
The key fragments and it's about the 
sex.

3550
02:54:39,770 --> 02:54:42,200
It's About basically what we've been 
talking about.

3551
02:54:42,310 --> 02:54:43,143
Great.
It's digging back into the sources and 

3552
02:54:44,341 --> 02:54:47,810
to finding out what we're going to segue
into secular situation.

3553
02:54:48,260 --> 02:54:51,140
What happened is a novel characters and 
action.

3554
02:54:51,170 --> 02:54:53,940
You can go to the queue fragments.com.
Uh,

3555
02:54:54,180 --> 02:54:55,880
it's out there.
Links are out there.

3556
02:54:55,970 --> 02:55:00,020
I podcasted every chapter is a podcast 
that I read,

3557
02:55:00,410 --> 02:55:01,243
so I just like people to read it,
enjoy the tail and think about the 

3558
02:55:05,001 --> 02:55:07,610
message that underlies this,
right,

3559
02:55:07,850 --> 02:55:08,683
that all of these myths and everything 
may have come from some particular 

3560
02:55:11,961 --> 02:55:12,794
historical actors and people,
but they're not necessarily what people 

3561
02:55:16,761 --> 02:55:18,290
are trying to get us to believe today.

3562
02:55:18,440 --> 02:55:19,273
Yeah.
Well I love that message and I love 

3563
02:55:20,581 --> 02:55:22,370
chatting with you,
so thank you so much.

3564
02:55:22,850 --> 02:55:23,880
Appreciate it.
Alright,

3565
02:55:24,440 --> 02:55:25,273
thank you.
Have a great night and thank you for 

3566
02:55:26,961 --> 02:55:28,130
your program.
All right,

3567
02:55:28,131 --> 02:55:30,080
I'm on with brandon and Ireland.
Brendan,

3568
02:55:30,081 --> 02:55:33,050
how's it going?
I'm doing well.

3569
02:55:33,051 --> 02:55:35,000
I feel like you could be my irish 
cousin.

3570
02:55:35,001 --> 02:55:40,001
We are dressed exactly the same 
apparently.

3571
02:55:41,151 --> 02:55:44,390
Actually my brother in law is half irish
and his name is brendan.

3572
02:55:44,391 --> 02:55:45,150
So there you go.

3573
02:55:45,150 --> 02:55:46,040
Okay,
cool.

3574
02:55:48,040 --> 02:55:48,870
Oh god,
um,

3575
02:55:48,870 --> 02:55:52,320
I probably should know that I'm going to
have to get back to you on that one.

3576
02:55:52,460 --> 02:55:54,020
Oh no.
Oh,

3577
02:55:54,430 --> 02:55:59,050
you already got me in trouble.
I think he's from near the local pub.

3578
02:56:02,510 --> 02:56:04,760
The pub to pub everybody at.
Alright.

3579
02:56:04,840 --> 02:56:06,760
So what,
what's going on these days in Ireland?

3580
02:56:06,761 --> 02:56:08,560
We don't hear much about Ireland in the 
news.

3581
02:56:08,590 --> 02:56:09,423
How's it going over there?

3582
02:56:11,480 --> 02:56:12,313
You won't heAr much about us,
but we just had a new government forms 

3583
02:56:18,250 --> 02:56:21,330
10 weeks after her election.
Miraculously.

3584
02:56:21,340 --> 02:56:23,530
No fan does.
There's a lot of discussion kind of.

3585
02:56:24,070 --> 02:56:24,903
And we have,
we have water charges were brought in 

3586
02:56:26,141 --> 02:56:28,900
and that's been discussed a lot.
Um,

3587
02:56:29,150 --> 02:56:29,983
the,
the fire life doesn't end the socialist 

3588
02:56:31,751 --> 02:56:33,160
parties.
They're not very happy with it.

3589
02:56:33,230 --> 02:56:37,030
Neither any really apart from the 
parties and governments.

3590
02:56:37,420 --> 02:56:41,290
And there's discussion over repeating 
our eighth amendment,

3591
02:56:41,291 --> 02:56:42,124
which is basically stipulates stopped.
Abortion is legal and artists and 

3592
02:56:49,710 --> 02:56:51,900
obviously in the google phones we,
um,

3593
02:56:52,060 --> 02:56:54,250
last year we legalized marriage for 
homosexuals,

3594
02:56:55,090 --> 02:56:56,290
which is fantastic.
Uh,

3595
02:56:56,291 --> 02:56:57,460
I wasn't in the country,
I was,

3596
02:56:57,520 --> 02:56:59,200
I was actually abroad in China for the 
year,

3597
02:56:59,600 --> 02:57:00,433
um,
you know,

3598
02:57:00,960 --> 02:57:02,800
if you're irish abroad,
which I was,

3599
02:57:03,490 --> 02:57:05,330
I wasn't too happy and I couldn't go 
was,

3600
02:57:05,590 --> 02:57:06,423
that was brilliant.

3601
02:57:07,170 --> 02:57:09,330
Wait,
let's pause there for a second.

3602
02:57:09,331 --> 02:57:10,164
So that's really interesting.
So you guys voted for legalizing gay 

3603
02:57:13,471 --> 02:57:15,960
marriage,
which is obviously very great and a very

3604
02:57:16,200 --> 02:57:18,000
liberal,
progressive concept.

3605
02:57:18,180 --> 02:57:20,340
And then at the same time,
you're telling me that they're voting on

3606
02:57:20,341 --> 02:57:23,550
possibly repealing a law that would,
uh,

3607
02:57:23,580 --> 02:57:24,570
that allows abortion.

3608
02:57:24,990 --> 02:57:26,010
No,
no.

3609
02:57:27,970 --> 02:57:28,803
Oh,
so abortion is abortion coMpletely 

3610
02:57:30,201 --> 02:57:31,034
illegal?

3611
02:57:31,130 --> 02:57:32,070
Yeah,
it's illegal.

3612
02:57:32,860 --> 02:57:33,693
Wow.
So,

3613
02:57:33,730 --> 02:57:36,210
um,
I need to do prp.

3614
02:57:36,230 --> 02:57:38,680
I assume people are having illegal 
abortions because people have them,

3615
02:57:38,890 --> 02:57:40,150
whether it's legal or not.
Right.

3616
02:57:41,080 --> 02:57:42,460
Generally heading over to england.

3617
02:57:43,170 --> 02:57:44,130
Wow.
So you.

3618
02:57:44,870 --> 02:57:46,590
So do you think the law is going to 
pass?

3619
02:57:47,740 --> 02:57:52,740
Uh,
I would say there was a savior died last

3620
02:57:53,270 --> 02:57:54,030
year.
There was unsafe.

3621
02:57:54,030 --> 02:57:58,520
And when opposition from perhaps with 
charities and stuff against,

3622
02:57:58,521 --> 02:58:00,410
um,
against gay marriage,

3623
02:58:02,220 --> 02:58:03,100
no one really cares

3624
02:58:05,060 --> 02:58:06,130
are the churches.
I mean,

3625
02:58:06,150 --> 02:58:08,410
are they losing their power quickly?
How,

3626
02:58:08,411 --> 02:58:10,980
how much power do they actually hold 
over politics these days?

3627
02:58:18,280 --> 02:58:21,780
You don't get too many people's onto my 
house and they don't take it seriously.

3628
02:58:21,790 --> 02:58:24,790
And most of our is very,
you know,

3629
02:58:25,030 --> 02:58:28,090
with regards to say homosexuality or 
whatever.

3630
02:58:28,290 --> 02:58:32,750
Generally as a country we're generally 
quite alright with it would require that

3631
02:58:32,850 --> 02:58:35,800
our country basically like,
as long as you don't annoy me,

3632
02:58:36,210 --> 02:58:39,010
I don't really care what you do.
You know what I mean?

3633
02:58:39,780 --> 02:58:41,590
That's my personal ideology to

3634
02:58:42,260 --> 02:58:43,093
perfect.

3635
02:58:43,140 --> 02:58:45,280
Yeah.
I need to get entirely the obviously.

3636
02:58:45,570 --> 02:58:47,230
So you're studying politics,
right?

3637
02:58:47,580 --> 02:58:48,413
Yeah.
Yeah.

3638
02:58:48,730 --> 02:58:50,350
What got you interested in politics?

3639
02:58:51,140 --> 02:58:53,440
Uh,
I can't really remember.

3640
02:58:53,441 --> 02:58:56,210
I think I just really wanted a,
I don't know,

3641
02:58:56,220 --> 02:58:57,053
maybe maybe it was probably the 
elevation with that new understanding 

3642
02:59:01,421 --> 02:59:03,400
african children and stuff.
And you want to be like,

3643
02:59:03,401 --> 02:59:05,260
oh,
I'd love to help someone like that.

3644
02:59:05,261 --> 02:59:10,160
I'm just kind of grill and grill was 
very interested in wars and I did,

3645
02:59:10,420 --> 02:59:11,253
I did a module last semester which was 
ethnic conflict was that little of 

3646
02:59:14,670 --> 02:59:15,503
monsters in the conflict doesn't matter.
So it's a lot of work in the united 

3647
02:59:20,731 --> 02:59:23,260
nation to my thought and a conflict 
resolution.

3648
02:59:23,650 --> 02:59:27,380
I've actually my team final exam for the
whole,

3649
02:59:27,520 --> 02:59:31,030
my whole undergraduate artS began,
so I'll be doing on saturday.

3650
02:59:31,510 --> 02:59:32,260
Nice.
Nice.

3651
02:59:32,260 --> 02:59:34,440
Well thanks for taking some time then.
So how.

3652
02:59:34,441 --> 02:59:35,274
No problem.
So one of the things that you wanted to 

3653
02:59:36,701 --> 02:59:37,534
talk to me about is one of the things 
that pretty much everybody wanted to 

3654
02:59:40,391 --> 02:59:41,224
talk about,
which is political correctness and how 

3655
02:59:44,201 --> 02:59:45,910
it's,
how it's seeping into society.

3656
02:59:45,911 --> 02:59:47,650
So what's going on on that front in 
Ireland?

3657
02:59:48,570 --> 02:59:50,280
um,
I think,

3658
02:59:52,080 --> 02:59:52,913
I think a lot of the stuff you see,
ideas of racism and stuff are imported 

3659
02:59:58,220 --> 02:59:59,420
from America.
We all think,

3660
02:59:59,450 --> 03:00:00,283
oh,
he probleMs with race in America is a 

3661
03:00:01,761 --> 03:00:04,580
very specific problem with racing.
You know what I mean?

3662
03:00:04,970 --> 03:00:06,140
And we think,
oh my god,

3663
03:00:06,141 --> 03:00:07,440
you're racist towards black people.
Got,

3664
03:00:07,480 --> 03:00:09,260
we never had that because,
you know,

3665
03:00:09,590 --> 03:00:12,890
we don't even our own country for nike,
nike for years,

3666
03:00:13,020 --> 03:00:14,270
you know,
25 years,

3667
03:00:14,320 --> 03:00:15,153
right.
Um,

3668
03:00:15,930 --> 03:00:16,763
we'll get,
we'll get people is generally higher 

3669
03:00:18,470 --> 03:00:20,680
lefty for people in the,
on the social spectrum.

3670
03:00:21,070 --> 03:00:21,903
I'm not saying you,
you don't have to social stuff seat to 

3671
03:00:23,071 --> 03:00:25,170
be ridiculous,
you know,

3672
03:00:25,460 --> 03:00:26,340
as,
as,

3673
03:00:26,341 --> 03:00:28,620
um,
as marginal as to saying,

3674
03:00:28,621 --> 03:00:29,454
you know,
regressive left and off and you get 

3675
03:00:31,321 --> 03:00:32,250
that.
We had that.

3676
03:00:32,420 --> 03:00:35,290
She was dealing with the german group 
together to heat up.

3677
03:00:36,060 --> 03:00:39,390
They had a protest here.
It was like a hundred people,

3678
03:00:39,430 --> 03:00:40,190
300 people.
So

3679
03:00:40,190 --> 03:00:41,023
yeah.
So it's not really picking up steam 

3680
03:00:42,121 --> 03:00:42,954
there.

3681
03:00:43,010 --> 03:00:44,450
Well,
this particular incident,

3682
03:00:44,451 --> 03:00:48,590
they were chased down the street by,
by a counter protestors to which we were

3683
03:00:48,591 --> 03:00:49,900
like,
I,

3684
03:00:50,450 --> 03:00:52,300
I totally disagree with that reads.
They're racist,

3685
03:00:52,301 --> 03:00:53,134
they're fascist,
whatever,

3686
03:00:53,170 --> 03:00:54,003
but up behind themselves.
But I think in art and we're doing okay 

3687
03:00:58,031 --> 03:00:58,864
and when you look,
we see stuff or having an american law 

3688
03:01:00,820 --> 03:01:01,653
walking by it

3689
03:01:05,070 --> 03:01:07,020
for everything that's going on here.
I'm wondering,

3690
03:01:07,500 --> 03:01:09,510
wondering about some of it myself.
Don't worry.

3691
03:01:09,900 --> 03:01:11,150
I,
I think we're okay,

3692
03:01:11,900 --> 03:01:14,660
but I mean when it comes to,
when it comes to terrorist attacks,

3693
03:01:15,680 --> 03:01:18,560
I'm criticizing islam.
You do get some really known.

3694
03:01:18,650 --> 03:01:22,660
Is onsite is the use of islam in a 
violent way?

3695
03:01:22,670 --> 03:01:24,560
Use of anything.
What?

3696
03:01:24,590 --> 03:01:27,500
I mentioned the underclass and hoodie 
when he looks.

3697
03:01:28,210 --> 03:01:29,043
Yeah,
that's been one of the through lines 

3698
03:01:30,881 --> 03:01:31,714
here because we're just talking about 
ideas and you mentioned an idea and you 

3699
03:01:34,901 --> 03:01:36,250
get some funny looks in class.

3700
03:01:36,960 --> 03:01:37,551
Yeah.
But no,

3701
03:01:37,551 --> 03:01:41,520
no one is known as shutting me down.
Naming this safe space,

3702
03:01:41,521 --> 03:01:42,540
which is progress.

3703
03:01:43,480 --> 03:01:44,313
So you don't have.
You guys don't have safe spaces and 

3704
03:01:45,481 --> 03:01:46,314
trigger warnings?

3705
03:01:46,950 --> 03:01:47,783
No.
If he smiled or university and they're 

3706
03:01:49,871 --> 03:01:51,700
too small,
I've been.

3707
03:01:51,740 --> 03:01:52,960
Oh,
it hasn't caught on yet.

3708
03:01:53,500 --> 03:01:54,333
I think it's a combo.
Maybe have small universities and a lot 

3709
03:01:56,051 --> 03:01:57,460
of beer.
Would that be fair to say?

3710
03:01:59,680 --> 03:02:00,513
No,
I think it's not showing up the class 

3711
03:02:01,330 --> 03:02:02,550
because of the period before.

3712
03:02:05,000 --> 03:02:05,880
There you go.
Well listen,

3713
03:02:05,890 --> 03:02:06,723
it was,
it was a pleasure talking to you and if 

3714
03:02:08,781 --> 03:02:10,400
you have any other fashion 
recommendations,

3715
03:02:10,401 --> 03:02:11,620
let me know.
All right.

3716
03:02:11,630 --> 03:02:14,540
I am on with brianna in Japan.
Brianna,

3717
03:02:14,541 --> 03:02:15,374
how are ya?

3718
03:02:16,050 --> 03:02:17,340
Good,
how are you?

3719
03:02:17,600 --> 03:02:20,270
I'm doing well.
So according to my notes here,

3720
03:02:20,300 --> 03:02:24,230
you are in Japan via Tennessee.
How many people can say that?

3721
03:02:25,080 --> 03:02:26,900
Uh,
not very many.

3722
03:02:27,200 --> 03:02:28,033
So from personal experience they 
probably don't even know to see is here 

3723
03:02:32,360 --> 03:02:34,670
99 percent of the time.
So yeah.

3724
03:02:34,671 --> 03:02:35,900
So tell me,
imagine,

3725
03:02:36,230 --> 03:02:37,063
tell me a little bit about that.
So do you grew up in Tennessee and when 

3726
03:02:39,171 --> 03:02:40,790
did you move to Japan?
What are you doing there?

3727
03:02:40,791 --> 03:02:41,624
What's going on?

3728
03:02:42,750 --> 03:02:44,430
Yeah,
so I grew up in Tennessee.

3729
03:02:44,670 --> 03:02:45,503
I was there for 18 years of my life 
until I moved to philadelphia for 

3730
03:02:49,591 --> 03:02:54,240
college and I've been in Japan for the 
past six months now,

3731
03:02:54,450 --> 03:02:59,450
or study abroad.
I'll be here a bit longer and let's see,

3732
03:02:59,880 --> 03:03:03,300
in Japan they know what the Tennessee 
waltz is and that's about it.

3733
03:03:03,360 --> 03:03:06,600
I don't even know what that song is.
I figured out about it when I was here.

3734
03:03:07,620 --> 03:03:11,850
It's an oldie,
I think their knowledGe of the states.

3735
03:03:11,980 --> 03:03:12,813
Yeah.
So what,

3736
03:03:13,040 --> 03:03:15,780
so,
so six months in Japan,

3737
03:03:15,850 --> 03:03:18,280
how have you been having major culture 
shock?

3738
03:03:18,460 --> 03:03:19,900
What do you like?
What don't you like?

3739
03:03:19,901 --> 03:03:20,734
Has it gone?

3740
03:03:21,730 --> 03:03:22,040
Hm.

3741
03:03:22,040 --> 03:03:22,873
It has been pretty good so far.
The culture shock isn't as bad as I 

3742
03:03:26,120 --> 03:03:27,980
thought it would be.
No,

3743
03:03:28,220 --> 03:03:30,530
it's pretty globalized world at this 
point.

3744
03:03:30,531 --> 03:03:33,920
So you know what Japan is like 
difference wise.

3745
03:03:34,730 --> 03:03:39,730
So it's been pretty good so far the 
biggest difference has been the academic

3746
03:03:40,611 --> 03:03:41,444
system.
So it's pretty fundamentally different 

3747
03:03:44,600 --> 03:03:48,830
from american conceptions of education.
Yeah.

3748
03:03:48,850 --> 03:03:49,950
So that's one of the things.

3749
03:03:50,980 --> 03:03:51,813
Yeah.
And that's one of the things that you 

3750
03:03:52,451 --> 03:03:53,284
had written in that you wanted to talk 
about a little bit about academia and 

3751
03:03:55,541 --> 03:03:57,320
the difference between America and 
Japan.

3752
03:03:57,590 --> 03:03:58,070
So let's,

3753
03:03:58,070 --> 03:03:58,903
uh,
let's do that.

3754
03:04:00,210 --> 03:04:01,043
Right?
So it's essentially been really 

3755
03:04:03,131 --> 03:04:03,964
refreshinG being here because a lot of 
them more and knowing aspects of 

3756
03:04:09,041 --> 03:04:12,460
american academia are not present here 
at the moment.

3757
03:04:12,490 --> 03:04:15,790
They might be later on in the future.
Right.

3758
03:04:15,850 --> 03:04:16,683
So like what for example,
so like the big issue with academia 

3759
03:04:21,031 --> 03:04:21,864
right now,
as you can imagine is the ideological 

3760
03:04:27,200 --> 03:04:29,970
like constraints placed on lots of 
students there.

3761
03:04:30,360 --> 03:04:34,500
But college in Japan is not a very 
ideological place.

3762
03:04:35,040 --> 03:04:37,820
Like the classroom is a sacred 
environment.

3763
03:04:37,890 --> 03:04:40,920
You do not talk about ideological things
there.

3764
03:04:42,180 --> 03:04:43,013
So it's pretty much not an issue which 
has been really good for me because 

3765
03:04:47,131 --> 03:04:47,964
that's one of the reasons I wanted to 
come to Japan to avoid that because my 

3766
03:04:52,531 --> 03:04:57,531
college is very stereotypical,
very liberal and very free speech sensor

3767
03:04:59,781 --> 03:05:01,860
should be in lots of ways.

3768
03:05:02,000 --> 03:05:02,833
Sure.
And a lot of the people that I've been 

3769
03:05:03,831 --> 03:05:06,390
talking to today are mentioning things 
like that and we,

3770
03:05:06,440 --> 03:05:08,690
we know about all this stuff.
So in Japan,

3771
03:05:08,691 --> 03:05:13,160
is there a drawback to having sorta of 
no ideology in the classroom?

3772
03:05:13,161 --> 03:05:16,550
Like is there any kind of drawbacks to 
just sort of straight information?

3773
03:05:18,180 --> 03:05:19,013
There is a bit of a drawback.
Japan's academic structure has its own 

3774
03:05:22,521 --> 03:05:24,860
issues that I could complain about all 
day.

3775
03:05:26,570 --> 03:05:27,403
We only have eight minutes.
I know compared to the issues with 

3776
03:05:31,401 --> 03:05:32,234
America right now.
I could deal with theM way more because 

3777
03:05:36,171 --> 03:05:37,004
that's essentially just me saying why do
I have to respect the teacher all the 

3778
03:05:39,621 --> 03:05:40,670
time?
I'm american,

3779
03:05:40,671 --> 03:05:45,671
I don't respect people.
So that's really the main issue.

3780
03:05:46,730 --> 03:05:47,563
But like information being presented 
here just so straightforwardly really 

3781
03:05:51,711 --> 03:05:52,544
does seem to help like nip the 
ideological issues in the bud there 

3782
03:05:57,140 --> 03:06:00,200
because that's not something teachers 
are supposed to be doing.

3783
03:06:00,360 --> 03:06:01,980
Yeah.
So how has it for you,

3784
03:06:01,981 --> 03:06:03,720
you said you'd been there for six 
months,

3785
03:06:03,770 --> 03:06:05,740
uh,
being uh,

3786
03:06:06,090 --> 03:06:08,820
an outsider in a pretty homogeneous 
society.

3787
03:06:08,821 --> 03:06:10,560
Have you had any challenges on that 
front?

3788
03:06:12,000 --> 03:06:14,540
Um,
I actually have nights.

3789
03:06:14,660 --> 03:06:16,820
It's pretty interesting like people 
stare at you,

3790
03:06:16,910 --> 03:06:19,550
but people stare at anyone who isn't 
japanese here.

3791
03:06:19,640 --> 03:06:20,473
It's,
I think 99 point seven percent of the 

3792
03:06:23,211 --> 03:06:27,290
people here at japanese.
And the points three people who are left

3793
03:06:27,291 --> 03:06:28,124
are mostly korean and chinese.
But you're an oddity no matter what you 

3794
03:06:31,521 --> 03:06:35,060
look like if you're from the west.
Do you speak japanese?

3795
03:06:36,260 --> 03:06:40,570
I speak japanese.
Aired quote gary,

3796
03:06:41,020 --> 03:06:42,230
don't worry.
I'm not going to test you.

3797
03:06:42,231 --> 03:06:44,930
Don't worry.
I started studying in college,

3798
03:06:44,931 --> 03:06:47,510
so I am in no way fluid.
Yeah,

3799
03:06:47,850 --> 03:06:51,140
that's nice.
Speak enough to prize people greatly.

3800
03:06:51,680 --> 03:06:52,513
Yeah.
So one of the things that you had 

3801
03:06:53,391 --> 03:06:55,680
written in that you wanted to talk about
that I thought was really interesting

3802
03:06:56,220 --> 03:07:00,420
was about content creators being 
unfairly criticized.

3803
03:07:00,630 --> 03:07:01,463
Um,
and I think what you were referring to 

3804
03:07:03,061 --> 03:07:03,894
is generally just sort of these 
youtubers that put their thoughts out 

3805
03:07:05,941 --> 03:07:08,550
there that ended up getting trolled 
endlessly.

3806
03:07:08,551 --> 03:07:10,200
That's the sense that I got.
Am I,

3807
03:07:10,201 --> 03:07:11,460
am I right on that?
And if not,

3808
03:07:11,750 --> 03:07:13,530
please correct me.
Yeah,

3809
03:07:13,730 --> 03:07:14,563
there's that.
And then there's the broader sense of 

3810
03:07:17,241 --> 03:07:18,074
content creation where it's like there 
are people who are writing books or 

3811
03:07:21,081 --> 03:07:21,914
making comics or movies that are being 
endlessly criticized with a very 

3812
03:07:27,050 --> 03:07:27,883
ideological bents at this point to the 
point where not meeting certain very 

3813
03:07:33,291 --> 03:07:34,124
leftist standards is considered a 
drawback in a fault when it probably 

3814
03:07:37,791 --> 03:07:39,360
shouldn't inherently be.
Yeah.

3815
03:07:39,610 --> 03:07:41,180
So give me,
give me an example of that.

3816
03:07:42,620 --> 03:07:43,453
so it's like,
it's not like I am mad when women show 

3817
03:07:46,581 --> 03:07:47,414
up in comic books,
but I don't think it's all that fair 

3818
03:07:50,780 --> 03:07:54,140
when you get comic books polled because 
they don't have women in them,

3819
03:07:54,500 --> 03:07:56,670
but that's not a drawback.
Yeah.

3820
03:07:57,470 --> 03:08:01,340
So that is the kind of see many years 
ago now,

3821
03:08:01,341 --> 03:08:02,174
because I'm old with the joker comic 
book cover where the joker was abusing 

3822
03:08:06,771 --> 03:08:08,960
bat girl because the joker,
the joker,

3823
03:08:09,830 --> 03:08:10,663
but they had that comment but cover 
poles and the artists essentially 

3824
03:08:13,400 --> 03:08:14,233
blacklisted because they said it 
encouraged violence against women and 

3825
03:08:18,711 --> 03:08:21,950
that should not have happened.
The joker was a bad guy.

3826
03:08:21,951 --> 03:08:24,000
That's what bad guys do.
Yeah.

3827
03:08:24,500 --> 03:08:25,333
A lot of people seem to really mix up 
what characters do versus what the 

3828
03:08:30,711 --> 03:08:31,544
author dies.
So it's the George Lucas argument where 

3829
03:08:34,521 --> 03:08:38,090
it's just like he put layer in a skimpy 
outfits like jabba the hutt,

3830
03:08:38,091 --> 03:08:38,924
but later in a skimpy outfit,
his job in a hives is a bad guy and 

3831
03:08:42,171 --> 03:08:44,550
you're supposed to think he's creepy.
Yeah.

3832
03:08:44,630 --> 03:08:46,400
Do you find that fascinating?

3833
03:08:47,980 --> 03:08:48,840
Yeah,
I mean I,

3834
03:08:48,841 --> 03:08:49,674
I find that totally fascinating that 
people seem incapable of certain amount 

3835
03:08:53,291 --> 03:08:56,380
of people are incapable of separating 
the artists,

3836
03:08:56,381 --> 03:08:58,690
the creator,
George Lucas,

3837
03:08:58,691 --> 03:09:00,100
who draws,
you know,

3838
03:09:00,120 --> 03:09:02,610
comes up with the idea of java and then 
he had it,

3839
03:09:02,680 --> 03:09:03,513
he had a slave and he put her in a sexy 
outfit and people think that's him 

3840
03:09:07,181 --> 03:09:10,150
imposing his view on what he thinks 
women should be.

3841
03:09:10,151 --> 03:09:11,110
It's kinda crazy.

3842
03:09:12,220 --> 03:09:13,990
Yeah,
it's pretty ridiculous.

3843
03:09:13,991 --> 03:09:14,824
I don't wAnt to send George Lucas.
He's done verY objectionable things on 

3844
03:09:19,721 --> 03:09:23,620
other things.
Jar jar is that a jar jar knock.

3845
03:09:25,550 --> 03:09:30,190
It's a knock against many,
many aspects of the star wars universe,

3846
03:09:31,190 --> 03:09:33,250
but not the slightly a thing.
It is fine.

3847
03:09:33,500 --> 03:09:34,333
Yeah.
You know that star wars is like 

3848
03:09:35,451 --> 03:09:36,950
everything to me.
I mean,

3849
03:09:37,130 --> 03:09:38,150
I don't know what to say right now.

3850
03:09:39,390 --> 03:09:42,270
I'm sure you would agree with me on many
of my complaints.
