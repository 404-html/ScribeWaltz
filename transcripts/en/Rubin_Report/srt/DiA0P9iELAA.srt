1
00:00:01,710 --> 00:00:06,330
We're officially entering the completely
insane phase of the 2016 election.

2
00:00:06,331 --> 00:00:08,610
I know it feels like we've been here for
about a year now,

3
00:00:08,611 --> 00:00:11,940
but if you think the political theater 
has been crazy so far,

4
00:00:11,941 --> 00:00:14,220
trust me.
You ain't seen nothing yet.

5
00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:17,400
It seems that everyone you know is 
starting to crack,

6
00:00:17,401 --> 00:00:18,270
right?
I mean,

7
00:00:18,271 --> 00:00:19,104
you could just open up twitter or 
facebook and every second of the day it 

8
00:00:23,011 --> 00:00:25,560
seems like someone is writing something 
crazy.

9
00:00:25,590 --> 00:00:26,423
Nobody has a clue as to what's going on 
anymore and you don't have to take my 

10
00:00:29,581 --> 00:00:30,414
word for that.
Just turn on CNN or Fox or MSNBC and 

11
00:00:33,661 --> 00:00:38,070
listen to the pundits who got everything
wrong for the last six months.

12
00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:40,650
Explain how the next six months are 
going to go.

13
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:43,830
These are the experts in what I have no 
idea.

14
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:45,293
Last week I discussed what I consider to
be the biggest risk of a trump 

15
00:00:48,301 --> 00:00:49,170
presidency.

16
00:00:49,230 --> 00:00:52,080
We have a salesman doing a hell of a 
sales job,

17
00:00:52,380 --> 00:00:55,080
but we really don't know what kind of 
product we're going to end up with.

18
00:00:55,081 --> 00:00:57,330
In the end.
As some of you pointed out,

19
00:00:57,360 --> 00:00:58,193
the notion of not knowing how someone 
will act once in office is actually no 

20
00:01:01,651 --> 00:01:02,484
different than with most politicians.
They pretty much all will say anything 

21
00:01:05,851 --> 00:01:09,330
to get elected and then do whatever they
can to stay in power.

22
00:01:09,660 --> 00:01:10,493
Ironically,
this endless loop of promises made and 

23
00:01:13,021 --> 00:01:13,854
broken by politicians who just want to 
stay in office is exactly what has led 

24
00:01:17,761 --> 00:01:18,594
to the rise of Donald trump.
People are sick of the status quo and 

25
00:01:21,541 --> 00:01:24,780
are willing to turn into a reality TV 
host as their savior.

26
00:01:24,990 --> 00:01:25,823
Some of you pointed out if my question 
of whether trump would even believe in 

27
00:01:29,011 --> 00:01:31,950
our three branches of government was 
legit.

28
00:01:32,190 --> 00:01:34,950
Many presidents have done plenty via 
executive action,

29
00:01:34,951 --> 00:01:35,784
effectively circumventing congress and 
usually like in the case of Barack 

30
00:01:39,390 --> 00:01:40,223
Obama,
they against using executive actions 

31
00:01:41,581 --> 00:01:43,320
until they're in office themselves.

32
00:01:43,710 --> 00:01:44,543
Of course,
presidents shouldn't get all the blame 

33
00:01:45,691 --> 00:01:46,524
for executive actions.
It's not as if this congress has been 

34
00:01:48,421 --> 00:01:50,850
eager to get anything done with the 
president.

35
00:01:51,210 --> 00:01:52,043
Regardless of WHO's to blame.
Though the average person sees usurping 

36
00:01:54,770 --> 00:01:58,320
of power and Washington gridlock in 
their minds,

37
00:01:58,350 --> 00:02:01,890
is a regular politician going to get our
country out of that pattern?

38
00:02:02,310 --> 00:02:05,340
No,
but an over the top businessman might.

39
00:02:06,030 --> 00:02:08,440
While we can parse out why trump has 
risen,

40
00:02:08,460 --> 00:02:13,080
the fact is he is here and all of us 
have to acknowledge there is a political

41
00:02:13,081 --> 00:02:16,500
movement brewing on the horizon.
It may not be the one you would like,

42
00:02:16,530 --> 00:02:17,363
but trying to silence trump supporters 
by blocking roads to rallies or by 

43
00:02:20,851 --> 00:02:24,270
labeling all his supporters.
Racist isn't going to stop his rise.

44
00:02:24,510 --> 00:02:27,000
Actually,
it's just going to make his support that

45
00:02:27,001 --> 00:02:27,834
much stronger.
This is why I always talk about the 

46
00:02:29,941 --> 00:02:34,290
battle of ideas on this show and it's 
not only why I talk about them,

47
00:02:34,291 --> 00:02:35,124
it's why I invite guests from all over 
the political map to share in their 

48
00:02:38,341 --> 00:02:39,540
views and guess what?

49
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:40,673
Yeah.
Sometimes they say things that I don't 

50
00:02:42,031 --> 00:02:44,100
agree with,
but I don't shout them down.

51
00:02:44,670 --> 00:02:48,420
The only way we can ever make progress 
is by hearing others.

52
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:51,960
This should be the number one principle 
of being a progressive,

53
00:02:51,961 --> 00:02:54,930
but these days it's not even on their 
top 10 list.

54
00:02:55,350 --> 00:02:56,183
If you hate trump,
if you think his comments about Muslims 

55
00:02:58,471 --> 00:03:01,450
are horrible,
if you think his border wall is terrible

56
00:03:01,451 --> 00:03:03,970
and you think his general disposition is
disgusting,

57
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:07,960
then use your speech to promote a 
candidate with better ideas.

58
00:03:08,170 --> 00:03:10,630
If you like Bernie,
that helped Bernie get the vote out.

59
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:13,000
If you like Hillary,
then tell your friends why.

60
00:03:13,001 --> 00:03:15,370
If you like Ted Cruz,
well then you're the only one,

61
00:03:15,371 --> 00:03:17,200
but good for you.
The point is,

62
00:03:17,201 --> 00:03:18,034
we've never needed a battle of ideas 
more in this country than we do right 

63
00:03:21,221 --> 00:03:23,590
now and we shouldn't be afraid to have 
it,

64
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:24,970
but here's the scary part.

65
00:03:24,970 --> 00:03:28,120
A battle of ideas means actually hearing
people out,

66
00:03:28,420 --> 00:03:29,253
so yes,
you can use your free speech to protest 

67
00:03:31,331 --> 00:03:34,660
trump or anyone else that's as American 
as it gets,

68
00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:37,960
but big goddamn deal.
If you're offended,

69
00:03:37,961 --> 00:03:41,980
suck it up and move on like you should 
have learned in fourth grade.

70
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:46,000
Do you think the people who blocked the 
road to the trump rally changed the mind

71
00:03:46,001 --> 00:03:48,370
of one person that they stopped from 
getting there?

72
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:49,593
No.
They actually did the complete opposite 

73
00:03:51,071 --> 00:03:53,080
because they didn't have a battle of 
ideas.

74
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:56,920
They had a battle of Mad Max fury road 
on a highway in Arizona.

75
00:03:57,160 --> 00:03:57,993
My guest this week is the infamous 
notorious and always outspoken Milo 

76
00:04:01,450 --> 00:04:02,283
Yiannopoulos.
Milo is a provocateur who's rise to 

77
00:04:03,521 --> 00:04:04,354
start them in some ways.
Mirrors trumps which might explain his 

78
00:04:06,821 --> 00:04:07,654
support for the Donald Milo is using all
the tools of the Internet to spread his 

79
00:04:11,321 --> 00:04:13,390
message against the authoritarians.

80
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:17,080
Not only does he always get a reaction,
but he's paid the price,

81
00:04:17,290 --> 00:04:18,123
losing his blue twitter verification 
check and being protested at several 

82
00:04:21,041 --> 00:04:23,890
universities on his current college 
tour.

83
00:04:24,070 --> 00:04:24,903
He sort of a micro trump and that he 
uses the media to a fuel his ascent to 

84
00:04:29,261 --> 00:04:32,200
start them.
While I have many differences of opinion

85
00:04:32,201 --> 00:04:33,034
with Milo,
we find ourselves as allies in the war 

86
00:04:34,841 --> 00:04:38,920
on free speech and against ideologies 
that would silence us both.

87
00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:42,640
There is way more that unites us as a 
people and as a country.

88
00:04:42,641 --> 00:04:45,100
Then the media will ever tell us 
decency,

89
00:04:45,101 --> 00:04:47,770
respect,
and humanity just aren't very clickable.

90
00:04:47,980 --> 00:04:50,830
For riots,
protests and violence will always be the

91
00:04:50,831 --> 00:04:54,160
lead story,
thus fueling the fire of intolerance.

92
00:04:54,550 --> 00:04:56,500
That's why I said you ain't seen nothing
yet.

93
00:04:56,501 --> 00:04:59,860
We could end up with a contested 
convention for the Republicans,

94
00:05:00,070 --> 00:05:02,740
a super delegate revolt by the 
Democrats,

95
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:05,950
a sudden third party candidate,
or who knows what else.

96
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:07,113
The important thing is that we learn to 
respect one another while this insane 

97
00:05:10,421 --> 00:05:14,530
process unfolds around us.
If our leaders aren't going to be great,

98
00:05:14,531 --> 00:05:17,680
then it's time for us to do some leading
ourselves.

99
00:05:20,110 --> 00:05:23,530
Milo Yiannopoulos is a senior staff 
editor for Breitbart News,

100
00:05:23,531 --> 00:05:24,364
a speaker,
and has been named the ultimate trolls 

101
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:29,440
by the fusion network,
Milo Yiannopoulos.

102
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:31,870
Welcome back to the show.
Thank you so much for having me.

103
00:05:32,220 --> 00:05:33,520
Well,
it was supposed to come back.

104
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:35,600
You are the second.
Well,

105
00:05:35,650 --> 00:05:36,483
maybe the third or the fourth.
I know you want to be first at 

106
00:05:37,991 --> 00:05:38,630
everything.
I'm.

107
00:05:38,630 --> 00:05:40,030
I'm joint generally am.
In fact,

108
00:05:40,031 --> 00:05:42,150
it's better than that.
I'm normally way ahead of my time.

109
00:05:42,180 --> 00:05:43,013
In fact,
I'm normally so earlier everything that 

110
00:05:44,531 --> 00:05:45,364
people think I'm crazy until six months 
later than I used to have a guy that I 

111
00:05:48,941 --> 00:05:50,710
wrote comedy with who used to always 
say,

112
00:05:50,711 --> 00:05:51,544
Dave,
we're so ahead of the curve or behind 

113
00:05:52,631 --> 00:05:53,464
it.
So maybe that's,

114
00:05:53,510 --> 00:05:55,550
maybe that's me.
Maybe this one.

115
00:05:55,570 --> 00:05:56,800
So unpopular.
I don't know.

116
00:05:57,380 --> 00:05:59,330
We've had a couple,
a couple of repeat guests,

117
00:05:59,331 --> 00:06:02,780
but in a way you're sort of the most 
important.

118
00:06:02,780 --> 00:06:05,630
Not that I have to inflate your ego 
because I know you like that,

119
00:06:05,690 --> 00:06:10,690
but a tremendous amount of stuff has 
happened since we had you on.

120
00:06:10,761 --> 00:06:13,010
So you were on,
I think it was the middle of October.

121
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:16,010
So we're only,
we're five or six months away from that.

122
00:06:16,030 --> 00:06:17,060
Right?
It's going great by the way.

123
00:06:17,150 --> 00:06:17,870
Thank you.
Love it.

124
00:06:17,870 --> 00:06:18,703
Um,
and a lot has happened in this space 

125
00:06:20,721 --> 00:06:23,600
that we exist,
this cultural libertarian space.

126
00:06:23,601 --> 00:06:24,800
So we got,
we got a lot to get to,

127
00:06:24,801 --> 00:06:27,140
but let's start with what's happening 
today.

128
00:06:27,470 --> 00:06:28,303
So,
uh,

129
00:06:28,340 --> 00:06:29,660
this morning,
uh,

130
00:06:29,661 --> 00:06:30,494
there was this terror attack in Brussels
at the airport and at a train station 

131
00:06:34,131 --> 00:06:35,080
over there,
uh,

132
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:37,250
it's still unfolding.
So right now we're taping this,

133
00:06:37,251 --> 00:06:39,760
it's Tuesday afternoon here in Los 
Angeles.

134
00:06:39,761 --> 00:06:41,890
So some stuff obviously will change.
Uh,

135
00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:44,930
why don't you just give me your initial 
thoughts on what's going on.

136
00:06:46,130 --> 00:06:46,963
Well,

137
00:06:47,630 --> 00:06:49,790
this is sort of what liberalism is 
welcomed into Europe.

138
00:06:49,910 --> 00:06:50,990
Um,
you know,

139
00:06:51,130 --> 00:06:51,963
uh,
this is the excuse making that's been 

140
00:06:53,721 --> 00:06:54,554
made for radical Islam,
which has prevented us from fighting 

141
00:06:56,151 --> 00:06:56,984
this problem by people who lie about the
source of these people in new stations 

142
00:07:00,771 --> 00:07:02,450
who refuse to accept that,
you know,

143
00:07:02,451 --> 00:07:03,284
these,
these attacks have anything to do with 

144
00:07:03,891 --> 00:07:07,220
Islam and the people wouldn't even use 
the word Muslim before it happens.

145
00:07:07,550 --> 00:07:09,230
This is preventing us from fixing the 
problem.

146
00:07:09,231 --> 00:07:10,064
You know,
this is preventing people from taking 

147
00:07:10,971 --> 00:07:13,310
out of adequate security precautions,
you know,

148
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:15,630
looking after themselves.
Europe now,

149
00:07:15,631 --> 00:07:16,464
you know,
welcoming in millions of people from 

150
00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:18,853
alien cultures,
whilst the establishment refuses to 

151
00:07:21,021 --> 00:07:21,854
accept that these people,
these people's belief systems are just 

152
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:27,910
dramatically incompatible with our own.
And you know,

153
00:07:27,911 --> 00:07:28,744
the regular citizenry as being aligned 
to and light about constantly all the 

154
00:07:32,631 --> 00:07:33,920
time.
But the media on this stuff,

155
00:07:34,270 --> 00:07:35,103
um,
we have population that is not able to 

156
00:07:36,231 --> 00:07:37,064
protect itself,
there is not adequately informed about 

157
00:07:38,421 --> 00:07:39,980
the risks,
the dangers of radical Islam.

158
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:44,570
And I'm the problem in Europe is that 
this stuff is now happening everywhere.

159
00:07:44,660 --> 00:07:47,870
No one is safe anywhere in Europe.
It's happening in Paris,

160
00:07:47,871 --> 00:07:49,360
has happened in London.
It's happening in process.

161
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:51,670
No one is safe from this stuff.
And what does it go?

162
00:07:51,750 --> 00:07:54,710
What our politicians leap to the airways
to say,

163
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:57,080
I really want to make it clear that has 
nothing to do with Islam.

164
00:07:57,081 --> 00:08:00,020
What it does it does.
And as a gay man,

165
00:08:00,050 --> 00:08:00,883
you know,
I'm terrified by the prospect of mass 

166
00:08:02,350 --> 00:08:03,183
Muslim immigration into Europe is one of
the reasons I spend so much time in 

167
00:08:05,601 --> 00:08:07,190
America now.
I don't want to be there anymore.

168
00:08:07,300 --> 00:08:08,950
Yeah.
So let's back up a little bit.

169
00:08:08,951 --> 00:08:09,784
It's interesting that your initial 
response to that is to talk about our 

170
00:08:13,931 --> 00:08:17,030
reaction to it rather than the ideology,
you know,

171
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:17,873
just nothing.
Surprises are not denying the ideology 

172
00:08:19,231 --> 00:08:19,720
or obviously,
yeah,

173
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:20,553
nothing surprises me about this.
Why are we surprised that Muslims are 

174
00:08:22,541 --> 00:08:23,970
blowing things up?
That's what they do,

175
00:08:24,150 --> 00:08:25,650
like I don't care about that,
you know,

176
00:08:25,651 --> 00:08:26,410
like it's,
it's a,

177
00:08:26,410 --> 00:08:27,243
it's a horrific for the people who are,
who are on the receiving end of this 

178
00:08:29,881 --> 00:08:30,810
terrorist stuff.
It is.

179
00:08:30,811 --> 00:08:32,940
Anybody surprised that isis blew 
something up,

180
00:08:33,010 --> 00:08:33,440
right?

181
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:34,273
So I'm gonna.
I'm gonna save you a little of Internet 

182
00:08:35,601 --> 00:08:36,434
hate.
You do make the distinction between the 

183
00:08:38,631 --> 00:08:41,450
nominal Muslim person,
the average person that's a Muslim,

184
00:08:41,451 --> 00:08:42,290
that doesn't take their religion.

185
00:08:42,430 --> 00:08:44,650
You don't need to.
You don't need to do me that favor.

186
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:45,513
No,
I don't care too much for that 

187
00:08:46,151 --> 00:08:49,060
distinction.
It is not extremists.

188
00:08:49,061 --> 00:08:52,240
It's not radical Islamists.
It's people.

189
00:08:52,241 --> 00:08:53,770
The security services,
uh,

190
00:08:53,780 --> 00:08:55,610
worried about that.
Um,

191
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:56,880
you know,
that are the problem.

192
00:08:56,881 --> 00:08:59,030
It is the silent majority Muslim.
So do nothing on,

193
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:00,600
in this situation,
have no peace movement,

194
00:09:00,601 --> 00:09:02,310
no resistance to their own extreme 
elements.

195
00:09:02,311 --> 00:09:05,760
Just like the progressive left in the 
West and 1111 countries.

196
00:09:05,761 --> 00:09:07,560
You and I could be killed for who we 
are.

197
00:09:07,770 --> 00:09:10,710
That's not isis,
that is mainstream Muslim culture.

198
00:09:10,890 --> 00:09:15,890
And we are importing that stuff into 
Europe by millions.

199
00:09:16,020 --> 00:09:16,853
No,
I don't make a meaningful distinction 

200
00:09:17,941 --> 00:09:19,380
between these things because I don't 
care.

201
00:09:19,590 --> 00:09:20,423
I don't see any reason to import these 
cultures into liberal Western 

202
00:09:23,941 --> 00:09:26,220
democracies.
I see no reason to do it whatsoever.

203
00:09:26,430 --> 00:09:29,580
And as Brigitte Gabriel wants,
very brilliantly said,

204
00:09:29,670 --> 00:09:32,190
in any case,
the peaceful majority are irrelevant.

205
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:34,710
It is not the peaceful majority that 
blow up buildings.

206
00:09:34,830 --> 00:09:37,140
It is the extremists.
And right now in the world,

207
00:09:37,141 --> 00:09:37,974
all of this stuff is coming from one 
culture and one religion and I don't 

208
00:09:40,261 --> 00:09:42,390
want it here.
So what do we do about that?

209
00:09:42,391 --> 00:09:47,391
Then what do you actually do?
We can't bomb these people into oblivion

210
00:09:49,490 --> 00:09:51,690
with radical part of this as an 
ideology,

211
00:09:51,750 --> 00:09:54,750
right?
So how do you be an evil ideology?

212
00:09:55,110 --> 00:09:59,100
We don't have to welcome one point 4 
million of them into Germany.

213
00:09:59,310 --> 00:10:04,310
We don't have to lie to people about 
what Islam is and what Muslims believe,

214
00:10:04,831 --> 00:10:07,410
which the press and politicians do all 
the time.

215
00:10:07,650 --> 00:10:08,483
We don't have to intervene in the 
countries where it's not necessarily 

216
00:10:11,041 --> 00:10:12,930
where we don't need to and I was 
supported the Iraq war,

217
00:10:12,931 --> 00:10:13,764
but some of the other things we do in 
the Middle East are not necessarily and 

218
00:10:15,301 --> 00:10:18,570
just drum up this,
this western hatred,

219
00:10:18,930 --> 00:10:19,763
uh,
the,

220
00:10:20,430 --> 00:10:23,010
some of what's gone on has something to 
do with the West,

221
00:10:23,011 --> 00:10:23,640
right?

222
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:25,330
No,
I'm not saying we're responsible for it.

223
00:10:25,740 --> 00:10:28,250
You know,
nobody has that parsing out.

224
00:10:28,260 --> 00:10:31,150
Blamed.
But you say you do see some connection,

225
00:10:31,151 --> 00:10:32,940
right.
Where you would be an idiot to deny it.

226
00:10:33,690 --> 00:10:35,730
You know,
we have been dealing with of idiots here

227
00:10:35,731 --> 00:10:37,390
on the left.
There are a lot of it is Georgia.

228
00:10:37,770 --> 00:10:38,603
Excellent.
Most of them say the reason I do your 

229
00:10:40,111 --> 00:10:42,530
show you on the very few liberal brain.
Yeah.

230
00:10:42,610 --> 00:10:44,820
And there are starting to not think 
that's a compliment.

231
00:10:45,030 --> 00:10:45,863
A lot of people say that to me and I'm 
starting to think maybe that's what I 

232
00:10:47,891 --> 00:10:49,200
mean.
Is it a compliment?

233
00:10:49,201 --> 00:10:49,951
I don't know.
I mean,

234
00:10:49,951 --> 00:10:51,780
it puts you up to average.
Is that a compliment?

235
00:10:52,230 --> 00:10:53,340
No idea.
No idea.

236
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:55,180
I mean,
look,

237
00:10:55,180 --> 00:11:00,180
the problem is not just radical Islam.
The problem is Islam,

238
00:11:00,391 --> 00:11:01,224
there are structural problems,
so this religion that mean it is 

239
00:11:02,221 --> 00:11:03,054
incompatible with modern free western 
liberal democracy we live in and 

240
00:11:06,121 --> 00:11:06,954
particularly for you and I as a for you 
and me and there's also a problem for 

241
00:11:09,961 --> 00:11:10,500
women.

242
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:13,740
There are very serious problems with 
Islamic culture,

243
00:11:13,890 --> 00:11:14,723
not Islamist jihadist,
a extremism and of course that plays 

244
00:11:19,171 --> 00:11:20,004
itself out and played itself out in the 
streets of Brussels and it plays itself 

245
00:11:22,411 --> 00:11:23,244
out with far too much regularity,
but with Islam there is a problem and 

246
00:11:26,611 --> 00:11:27,444
nobody wants to talk about it and what 
you tried to do earlier to save me from 

247
00:11:29,611 --> 00:11:30,444
myself,
I don't want it because now I respect 

248
00:11:32,371 --> 00:11:34,830
that I don't want it because I've got to
the point where I'm thinking,

249
00:11:34,831 --> 00:11:36,450
look,
the West,

250
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:39,480
the West that Islam hates so much is 
what has given us gay rights.

251
00:11:39,510 --> 00:11:42,150
It has provided that for women it's 
given women the vote.

252
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:43,800
It has ended slavery,
which is,

253
00:11:43,801 --> 00:11:45,360
you know,
not the case everywhere.

254
00:11:45,361 --> 00:11:48,390
Everywhere in the world it has given gay
people and women.

255
00:11:48,391 --> 00:11:49,224
All of the rights we now enjoy.
There is effective blanket equality in 

256
00:11:52,730 --> 00:11:54,220
in the West for all of these people

257
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:55,273
and every other minority to exactly 
importing Muslims is going to turn the 

258
00:11:58,961 --> 00:12:01,210
clock back and this is what you talk 
about when you,

259
00:12:01,211 --> 00:12:03,820
when you coin a coin and popularized 
this phrase,

260
00:12:03,821 --> 00:12:05,530
regressive left,
which came from this show,

261
00:12:05,740 --> 00:12:07,240
right?
But you don't go far enough.

262
00:12:07,380 --> 00:12:08,860
What?
What does the regressive left means?

263
00:12:08,861 --> 00:12:12,340
It means it's going to take us backwards
into an era of hatred and bigotry.

264
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:15,850
Well,
the left seems to want to import Muslims

265
00:12:15,851 --> 00:12:17,980
by the millions into all of our 
countries.

266
00:12:18,100 --> 00:12:21,310
That's the regressive consequence.
And it's not just terrorism.

267
00:12:21,370 --> 00:12:23,770
So what do you think is going on with 
these people?

268
00:12:23,771 --> 00:12:27,490
I know many of these people very well.
I've worked with a lot of these people.

269
00:12:28,740 --> 00:12:29,573
Well I don't anymore,
but this idea judge a man by his 

270
00:12:33,011 --> 00:12:33,844
friends,
you know,

271
00:12:34,830 --> 00:12:37,390
but this ideology,
I mean even this morning on twitter as I

272
00:12:37,391 --> 00:12:38,224
was scrolling through all the craziness 
that every time there's a terror attack 

273
00:12:40,001 --> 00:12:40,930
or you know,
you get every,

274
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:42,790
you know,
avenue of craziness.

275
00:12:42,790 --> 00:12:44,410
I saw someone,
a girl,

276
00:12:44,650 --> 00:12:45,483
a 20 something year old girl in Belgium.
She actually tweeted that the Hashtag 

277
00:12:52,390 --> 00:12:53,830
Stop Islam,
the Hashtag itself.

278
00:12:53,890 --> 00:12:54,723
She said,
that's worse than what actually 

279
00:12:56,561 --> 00:12:58,810
happened.
Mean that I'm not kidding.

280
00:12:58,860 --> 00:13:01,750
I mean,
you see this every time you see this,

281
00:13:01,751 --> 00:13:02,584
every time.
This is the left believes that words 

282
00:13:03,821 --> 00:13:04,780
have power.
They don't have.

283
00:13:05,410 --> 00:13:06,243
They think that you can stop somebody 
from being homophobic by banning the 

284
00:13:08,711 --> 00:13:09,970
word gay from the playground.
Um,

285
00:13:10,090 --> 00:13:12,610
they think that you can end racism by 
banning the n word.

286
00:13:12,850 --> 00:13:13,683
They think that if you shape language 
and a control culture that you can just 

287
00:13:17,241 --> 00:13:18,280
stamp out bigotry.
Well,

288
00:13:18,281 --> 00:13:20,980
that's not how it works.
The point of a civilized society,

289
00:13:20,981 --> 00:13:21,531
the point of,
uh,

290
00:13:21,531 --> 00:13:22,364
of,
of etiquette and the point of 

291
00:13:23,411 --> 00:13:28,411
negotiating the world around us and 
negotiating with other people is to live

292
00:13:29,290 --> 00:13:31,480
with one another.
Despite our prejudices.

293
00:13:31,481 --> 00:13:35,140
And despite our differences,
the purpose of a civilized society ought

294
00:13:35,141 --> 00:13:37,690
to be to enable everybody to live 
together in harmony,

295
00:13:37,691 --> 00:13:38,524
which is why I hate what the gay lobby 
does when it bullies and ridicules 

296
00:13:42,221 --> 00:13:44,350
Christians,
Christians not going away.

297
00:13:44,350 --> 00:13:45,183
You know,
you're not gonna Bully Christianity out 

298
00:13:46,421 --> 00:13:47,254
of existence.
You're not gonna Ridicule Christianity 

299
00:13:48,311 --> 00:13:51,250
of existence just because buzzfeed 
doesn't like people who believe in God.

300
00:13:51,590 --> 00:13:54,440
Now he's had everybody to,
you know,

301
00:13:54,580 --> 00:13:56,260
and we were doing a good job of that.
You know,

302
00:13:56,261 --> 00:13:59,080
the West is doing a pretty good job of 
that right up until we started importing

303
00:13:59,081 --> 00:14:00,650
Muslims that,
I mean there's,

304
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:01,713
you're giving me a lot there.
That sort of is going to be the through 

305
00:14:03,041 --> 00:14:05,950
line for everything else we're going to 
discuss.

306
00:14:05,980 --> 00:14:06,440
Uh,
so,

307
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:06,830
you know,
let,

308
00:14:06,830 --> 00:14:07,663
let's just jump into it.
Let's just go into some of the free 

309
00:14:08,741 --> 00:14:09,574
speech stuff.
So a lot of things have happened to you 

310
00:14:10,900 --> 00:14:12,250
over the past few months.
Your,

311
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:15,880
your star has risen the last you were 
here,

312
00:14:15,881 --> 00:14:18,520
you had a blue twitter verification 
check.

313
00:14:18,820 --> 00:14:20,950
You do not have it anymore.
You are,

314
00:14:20,951 --> 00:14:21,784
as far as I know,
the only public person to have their 

315
00:14:24,881 --> 00:14:27,040
blue verification check for those that 
don't know what it means.

316
00:14:27,041 --> 00:14:29,110
I mean,
it basically means you are who you are,

317
00:14:29,111 --> 00:14:33,220
so that if you're a celebrity or you're 
just saying you are who you are,

318
00:14:33,221 --> 00:14:34,000
that's it.
Yeah.

319
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,410
Right,
um,

320
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:36,273
but you had yours remove.
I don't think there's been any other 

321
00:14:39,851 --> 00:14:43,210
case of that happening and it clearly 
was a punitive measure.

322
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:44,460
So just real quick though.
Sure.

323
00:14:44,590 --> 00:14:45,423
I just want people to saying we're not 
doing this to be so inside my little 

324
00:14:47,801 --> 00:14:48,910
twitter account,
got whatever,

325
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:52,160
but there's a bigger issue because 
twitter is using,

326
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:52,993
I'm using a mechanism to protect public 
figures like us from impersonation and 

327
00:14:57,231 --> 00:14:58,064
also their privilege concerns when 
somebody's speaking to me in my role as 

328
00:15:00,021 --> 00:15:00,854
a journalist,
they have an expectation of privacy and 

329
00:15:02,300 --> 00:15:03,133
of legal privilege.
Now people are deeming people with my 

330
00:15:04,821 --> 00:15:05,654
name on twitter,
they're giving personal information 

331
00:15:06,471 --> 00:15:08,660
about their lives that exposes twitter 
to liability too,

332
00:15:08,661 --> 00:15:10,480
by the way.
There was very serious,

333
00:15:10,580 --> 00:15:11,850
you know,
there's a reason why,

334
00:15:11,851 --> 00:15:14,270
but it's a good idea to have public 
figures,

335
00:15:14,660 --> 00:15:15,770
um,
verify,

336
00:15:15,771 --> 00:15:17,390
but they used it as an ideological 
weapon.

337
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:20,180
And now when I went to the White House 
to ask about this,

338
00:15:20,280 --> 00:15:21,113
um,
asked Josh earnest about this and he 

339
00:15:22,041 --> 00:15:22,874
said very interestingly,
I thought the president would be the 

340
00:15:25,641 --> 00:15:26,474
first to affirm that the success of 
these social networking companies rests 

341
00:15:29,811 --> 00:15:31,970
on their commitment to first amendment 
principles.

342
00:15:31,971 --> 00:15:32,804
Now,
he wasn't saying you can enforce the 

343
00:15:33,831 --> 00:15:35,270
first amendment are private companies.

344
00:15:35,340 --> 00:15:36,173
And most I'd get thrown out of the 
conservative club if I've tried to 

345
00:15:38,900 --> 00:15:40,280
suggest that.
And just to be clear,

346
00:15:40,281 --> 00:15:43,250
the first amendment is about the 
government taking away your free speech.

347
00:15:43,730 --> 00:15:46,150
Now people are taking away,
uh,

348
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:47,153
the late Aaron Swartz,
the founder of Reddit said censorship 

349
00:15:49,851 --> 00:15:50,684
has a meaning outside the government 
when private companies have a monopoly 

350
00:15:53,391 --> 00:15:54,224
on certain kinds of speech now to just 
sit and he does not only because it has 

351
00:15:57,111 --> 00:15:59,780
such a stranglehold on journalism and 
the media,

352
00:15:59,781 --> 00:16:02,120
but also business invented entirely new 
public square.

353
00:16:02,540 --> 00:16:03,373
If you were in a pub and you make a joke
that involves race or sex or sex or 

354
00:16:08,091 --> 00:16:10,040
whatever,
and the Publican doesn't like it,

355
00:16:10,041 --> 00:16:12,560
you can go to another pub down the road.
There is no other twitter,

356
00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:13,593
right?
This is a fundamentally important part 

357
00:16:15,681 --> 00:16:16,514
of our media and our democracy.
So they're controlling basically one of 

358
00:16:18,771 --> 00:16:20,310
the big highways of information,
right?

359
00:16:20,330 --> 00:16:21,830
And it comes out.
It comes with responsibility.

360
00:16:21,831 --> 00:16:23,690
It comes responsibility to use this.
Do you want to two things.

361
00:16:23,691 --> 00:16:25,550
One,
be honest and say,

362
00:16:25,590 --> 00:16:27,500
you know what,
we're a liberal space,

363
00:16:27,540 --> 00:16:28,291
period.
Conservative,

364
00:16:28,291 --> 00:16:29,480
sooner or later you're going to get 
banned.

365
00:16:29,570 --> 00:16:30,403
We don't really want you here,
but you can stay for as long as you 

366
00:16:31,701 --> 00:16:32,780
know,
you don't piss us off too much.

367
00:16:33,180 --> 00:16:34,013
Um,
and I pissed them off too much and they 

368
00:16:35,091 --> 00:16:38,450
have banned people not all the time,
always in one direction.

369
00:16:38,451 --> 00:16:39,870
You always conservatively band.
Also,

370
00:16:39,950 --> 00:16:42,420
I guess suspended now and again because 
I make jokes about feminists,

371
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:45,190
feminists or whatever.
So like I said that I,

372
00:16:45,340 --> 00:16:49,660
I said that I'd been appointed social 
justice editor of Buzzfeed as a church.

373
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:52,370
A lot of people took you seriously.
It was quiet.

374
00:16:52,371 --> 00:16:54,050
It was funny.
Idiots,

375
00:16:54,470 --> 00:16:55,450
idiots.
Uh,

376
00:16:55,490 --> 00:16:57,080
and then I,
and then immediately after that,

377
00:16:57,081 --> 00:17:01,070
when people were tweeting Ben Smith,
I'm the boss and say,

378
00:17:01,071 --> 00:17:01,730
how dare you?

379
00:17:01,730 --> 00:17:03,230
Hi this man,
I'm never reading breastfeed again.

380
00:17:03,740 --> 00:17:05,560
When I knew that it had taken hold,
then I,

381
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:07,430
then I started the hashtag feminism is 
cancer.

382
00:17:07,700 --> 00:17:08,750
Um,
and I did it polls,

383
00:17:08,751 --> 00:17:09,584
you know,
would you rather your children had 

384
00:17:09,831 --> 00:17:13,220
feminism or cancer until 22,000
people voted and they voted for cancer.

385
00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:15,500
And I had cancer survivors email,
uh,

386
00:17:15,530 --> 00:17:18,290
acting may say I'm a two time cancer 
survivor and I still chose counseling.

387
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:19,820
Funny.
That was funny.

388
00:17:20,420 --> 00:17:20,900
Anyway,
that's.

389
00:17:20,900 --> 00:17:22,460
They didn't like,
they didn't like that very much.

390
00:17:22,461 --> 00:17:25,280
So yeah,
the point is,

391
00:17:25,460 --> 00:17:27,470
if you are these days,
irreverent,

392
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:29,030
mischievous,
provocative,

393
00:17:29,060 --> 00:17:29,893
and to do those things,
you have to be conservative because the 

394
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:32,690
establishment is,
is,

395
00:17:32,691 --> 00:17:33,524
is,
is not just liberal but progressive 

396
00:17:35,361 --> 00:17:36,390
liberal.
Um,

397
00:17:36,710 --> 00:17:37,543
if you want to be punk these days,
you want to be cool and dissident and 

398
00:17:39,660 --> 00:17:40,970
mischievous.
You have to be conservative.

399
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:41,833
And if you are that on twitter,
sooner or later you can lose your 

400
00:17:43,611 --> 00:17:44,270
account.

401
00:17:44,270 --> 00:17:44,870
Now,
uh,

402
00:17:44,870 --> 00:17:47,600
they should be honest about that.
Or they should,

403
00:17:47,750 --> 00:17:50,010
they should enforce free speech and not 
this weird.

404
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:51,113
There's weird definition of free speech 
that Jack Dorsey seems to have the CEO 

405
00:17:54,211 --> 00:17:55,044
of twitter.
He seems to think that it's a sort of 

406
00:17:57,600 --> 00:18:01,260
freedom from rather than freedom too.
So free speech on twitter.

407
00:18:01,261 --> 00:18:04,710
It means freedom from conservatives,
freedom from different points of view,

408
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:07,650
and it plays into the safe space and 
trigger warning culture that I know that

409
00:18:07,651 --> 00:18:10,680
you and your listeners know no more than
enough about already.

410
00:18:10,870 --> 00:18:11,703
Um,
it,

411
00:18:11,850 --> 00:18:12,683
it's freedom from ever having to be 
exposed to anything that might make you 

412
00:18:14,761 --> 00:18:16,140
feel uncomfortable.
Well,

413
00:18:16,141 --> 00:18:18,890
that's not what freedom of speeches and 
for him,

414
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:22,950
he needs to stop lying to users that the
twister is,

415
00:18:22,951 --> 00:18:23,910
you know,
the free speech.

416
00:18:23,911 --> 00:18:24,960
We have,
the free speech party.

417
00:18:25,110 --> 00:18:25,943
It's very clear if you step off,
if you go off reservation on most of 

418
00:18:29,341 --> 00:18:31,530
these social networks,
you're going to be punished.

419
00:18:31,590 --> 00:18:33,360
And facebook too,
by the way,

420
00:18:33,390 --> 00:18:36,150
is teaming up with Angela Merkel in 
Germany.

421
00:18:36,420 --> 00:18:37,253
I think everybody knows it's now to 
sensor perfectly reasonable mainstream 

422
00:18:40,021 --> 00:18:40,854
discussion from citizens who are 
concerned about mass immigration into 

423
00:18:43,441 --> 00:18:44,274
the country,
about millions of people coming into 

424
00:18:45,061 --> 00:18:48,570
their country about the rape epidemics,
about all sorts of awful things that are

425
00:18:48,571 --> 00:18:51,990
happening to young German girls.
Facebook won't let you talk about it,

426
00:18:51,991 --> 00:18:52,880
you know,
just

427
00:18:53,020 --> 00:18:55,870
prove that is true and that you're not 
making this up.

428
00:18:55,871 --> 00:18:57,240
I've had to make things.
Yeah.

429
00:18:57,430 --> 00:18:58,263
But I have,
I have two instances where I have a 

430
00:18:59,441 --> 00:19:02,500
decent connection at facebook and I've 
had two instances.

431
00:19:02,501 --> 00:19:05,290
One where my former guest feisal site,
Almodovar,

432
00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:07,810
who's been here twice,
who is from Iraq,

433
00:19:07,811 --> 00:19:10,930
a refugee from Iraq who is now living in
the west and fight through his,

434
00:19:10,940 --> 00:19:11,773
around his page got banned because 
people didn't like that he was speaking 

435
00:19:14,411 --> 00:19:15,820
out against Islam,
Islam.

436
00:19:15,821 --> 00:19:19,990
And then I had a group of atheists,
Muslims that their page got banned as if

437
00:19:19,991 --> 00:19:22,530
it was hate speech.
So what you're saying,

438
00:19:22,650 --> 00:19:23,483
I'm just given,
I just want people to understand the 

439
00:19:24,910 --> 00:19:25,743
real.
You're not just

440
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:27,233
do to everybody and they,
and they don't even can now about 

441
00:19:29,521 --> 00:19:31,440
violating their own sacred tenants.
Uh,

442
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:33,990
you know,
this identity Marion nonsense,

443
00:19:33,991 --> 00:19:35,730
what you're sort of in a protected class
from a,

444
00:19:35,731 --> 00:19:36,900
you know,
as far as liberals or consent.

445
00:19:36,901 --> 00:19:38,760
If you're a woman or if you're gay,
if you're black or whatever.

446
00:19:39,660 --> 00:19:41,240
Now,
there are universities that are there,

447
00:19:41,241 --> 00:19:43,560
there are university students who are no
platforming,

448
00:19:43,561 --> 00:19:45,480
black transsexuals,
because you know,

449
00:19:45,481 --> 00:19:46,314
they get invited by Jews.
This stuff has become incidentally 

450
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:51,450
happened last week and they got him up 
and they don't mind.

451
00:19:51,510 --> 00:19:55,260
They don't mind if you're gay or if your
brown skinned or whatever.

452
00:19:55,650 --> 00:19:58,320
What they,
what they will not tolerate is diversity

453
00:19:58,321 --> 00:19:59,370
of opinion.
You know,

454
00:19:59,580 --> 00:20:01,260
the diversity of skin color has gone out
the window.

455
00:20:01,261 --> 00:20:03,090
Now,
if you want to cry victim,

456
00:20:03,091 --> 00:20:04,680
if you want to pretend you're an 
oppressed class,

457
00:20:04,681 --> 00:20:05,970
you'll get all sorts of clothes from the
left.

458
00:20:05,970 --> 00:20:09,720
You'll get all sorts of rewards.
They don't care so much about that.

459
00:20:09,721 --> 00:20:11,310
However,
what they really don't want,

460
00:20:11,370 --> 00:20:14,970
what they are terrified of because they 
can't fight it with facts,

461
00:20:15,570 --> 00:20:20,310
is libertarian and conservative points 
of view and that freedom from ever being

462
00:20:20,311 --> 00:20:21,144
challenged on anything that freedom from
ever having to encounter something with 

463
00:20:24,571 --> 00:20:25,404
which you might disagree or something 
that might make you feel uncomfortable 

464
00:20:26,851 --> 00:20:31,500
or something that might ridicule you is 
the definition of freedom that has taken

465
00:20:31,501 --> 00:20:34,560
hold on the left in America today.
And it is a poisonous.

466
00:20:34,561 --> 00:20:35,330
It is,
um,

467
00:20:35,330 --> 00:20:36,163
you know,
it is entirely antithetical to 

468
00:20:37,530 --> 00:20:38,363
democracy,
to the free and open exchange of ideas 

469
00:20:40,141 --> 00:20:42,230
to classical liberalism to,
um,

470
00:20:42,350 --> 00:20:43,183
intellectually

471
00:20:43,340 --> 00:20:44,230
that's what it is.
They're really,

472
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:48,520
that classical liberalism has really 
been pushed aside where I'm at anymore,

473
00:20:48,610 --> 00:20:51,520
but nobody really understood.
Nobody even knows that it exists.

474
00:20:51,521 --> 00:20:53,490
I think the university is it

475
00:20:53,590 --> 00:20:54,330
speak up.
I mean,

476
00:20:54,330 --> 00:20:54,950
you know,
I,

477
00:20:54,950 --> 00:20:55,783
I'm on my tour at the moment of 
universities and the thing that has 

478
00:20:58,300 --> 00:21:02,680
amazed me is the extent to which the 
faculty at these universities don't just

479
00:21:02,681 --> 00:21:05,920
refuse to expose their students to 
different points of view.

480
00:21:06,340 --> 00:21:08,890
They don't just ridicule conservative 
points of view.

481
00:21:08,980 --> 00:21:10,950
They don't even know about them.
Uh,

482
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:11,450
you know,
the,

483
00:21:11,450 --> 00:21:13,130
the,
it's been for awhile,

484
00:21:13,180 --> 00:21:17,080
fairly well known that the number one 
textbook economics textbook,

485
00:21:17,170 --> 00:21:20,260
um,
in this country in America,

486
00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:21,131
uh,
you know,

487
00:21:21,131 --> 00:21:23,050
on set lists is Karl Marx,
right?

488
00:21:23,110 --> 00:21:23,943
And say what you want about it.
It's kind of a conservative talking 

489
00:21:25,961 --> 00:21:28,480
point,
but it's becoming increasingly clear,

490
00:21:28,481 --> 00:21:29,314
especially at liberal arts colleges that
don't have any sort of federal 

491
00:21:31,061 --> 00:21:32,300
regulations about,
you know,

492
00:21:32,580 --> 00:21:34,990
the sorts of things that the government 
doesn't get involved in.

493
00:21:34,991 --> 00:21:37,240
What they teach and these liberal arts 
colleges,

494
00:21:37,241 --> 00:21:39,550
the professors don't even know 
alternative points of view,

495
00:21:39,551 --> 00:21:40,384
let alone teach their students when I go
to these colleges and I suggest that 

496
00:21:43,870 --> 00:21:44,703
perhaps you don't have to give 75 
percent of your earnings away to the 

497
00:21:46,781 --> 00:21:48,790
government for them,
spend it on feminists dance therapy.

498
00:21:48,970 --> 00:21:50,100
Perhaps you know,
the,

499
00:21:50,110 --> 00:21:50,943
you know,
perhaps this wage gap stuff isn't real 

500
00:21:52,091 --> 00:21:52,790
after all.
They,

501
00:21:52,790 --> 00:21:53,623
I mean,
some of the students look at me weird 

502
00:21:54,791 --> 00:21:57,610
like slack jawed horror shock,
surprise.

503
00:21:57,790 --> 00:22:00,640
It's like,
it's like a revelation to them.

504
00:22:00,780 --> 00:22:01,613
Um,
the fact that somebody might come and 

505
00:22:02,411 --> 00:22:03,244
actually ask for evidence based policy 
and evidence based beliefs rather than 

506
00:22:08,381 --> 00:22:12,430
this sort of bizarre ideology that 
they're being fed at the moment,

507
00:22:12,460 --> 00:22:13,293
which is only really flourishing because
of the safe space culture and the 

508
00:22:16,661 --> 00:22:17,494
trigger warning culture because it can 
never be interrogated because it can 

509
00:22:18,821 --> 00:22:20,410
never be challenged because it can never
be,

510
00:22:20,710 --> 00:22:21,760
um,
uh,

511
00:22:21,830 --> 00:22:22,700
it can.
Nope.

512
00:22:22,770 --> 00:22:25,570
Nobody is allowed to say,
well,

513
00:22:25,571 --> 00:22:27,100
what about this?
You know,

514
00:22:27,330 --> 00:22:27,841
um,
you,

515
00:22:27,841 --> 00:22:29,940
you're suggesting that women get paid,
blah,

516
00:22:29,980 --> 00:22:31,240
blah.
What about this?

517
00:22:31,670 --> 00:22:34,250
The economics.
Don't say this by you,

518
00:22:34,280 --> 00:22:35,113
by Milo.
Showing up to a college and saying a 

519
00:22:36,591 --> 00:22:37,790
couple things.
You're not.

520
00:22:37,940 --> 00:22:39,860
I've never heard you incite violence,
right?

521
00:22:39,861 --> 00:22:42,830
I've never heard you call to,
to hurt anyone directly.

522
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:44,810
You're saying things you're even 
admitting.

523
00:22:44,811 --> 00:22:46,280
I mean,
I think it's clear that you're admitting

524
00:22:46,281 --> 00:22:51,080
that you do sometimes go over the line 
of what you even think is proper.

525
00:22:51,081 --> 00:22:54,530
Sort of to just elicit a response from 
it isn't true,

526
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:56,580
but I'll certainly use provocative 
language.

527
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:57,451
Um,
I mean,

528
00:22:57,451 --> 00:22:58,284
I don't know.
I'll go up and I'll make black dick 

529
00:22:59,821 --> 00:23:02,160
jokes and I'll do all that kind of stuff
because I,

530
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:05,840
we're still allowed to make jokes in 
this guy at that.

531
00:23:06,590 --> 00:23:06,951
Well,
no.

532
00:23:06,951 --> 00:23:09,220
Well you say that,
but now for to say that,

533
00:23:09,270 --> 00:23:11,220
but Chris Rock Seinfeld,
all these comedians,

534
00:23:11,221 --> 00:23:12,330
comedian,
and you don't understand this,

535
00:23:12,540 --> 00:23:13,373
you know,
comedians like gay people that we spoke 

536
00:23:14,641 --> 00:23:16,140
about this in the last,
the last time I was here,

537
00:23:16,141 --> 00:23:17,670
so canaries in the coal mine with this 
stuff.

538
00:23:17,671 --> 00:23:19,950
They understand the threats to create a 
freedom before everybody else.

539
00:23:20,190 --> 00:23:21,023
And No,
you can't make jokes in this country 

540
00:23:22,111 --> 00:23:23,170
anymore.
You can't make this job.

541
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:24,113
You cannot make innocent jokes in this 
country anymore without running serious 

542
00:23:26,731 --> 00:23:27,564
risk of professional professional damage
and social censure and if you are a 

543
00:23:30,391 --> 00:23:31,224
public figure making a joke about 
anything to do with race or gender or 

544
00:23:34,980 --> 00:23:36,900
anything,
you know you are at risk.

545
00:23:36,901 --> 00:23:39,450
You're at risk from one of these,
one of these mobs coming off soon.

546
00:23:39,560 --> 00:23:40,393
You know,
it's so funny because I'm obviously as 

547
00:23:41,691 --> 00:23:46,640
big of a free speech proponent as could 
possibly exist and I think sometimes

548
00:23:46,790 --> 00:23:48,350
that I'm tweeting something and I'm 
thinking,

549
00:23:48,351 --> 00:23:49,184
man,
if someone looks back on this in 10 

550
00:23:50,301 --> 00:23:51,530
years,
if this ideology,

551
00:23:51,531 --> 00:23:55,910
if this leftist ideology keeps taking 
thrown in jail in 10 years,

552
00:23:55,911 --> 00:23:58,070
they're going to go well because 
there'll be a law passed and said,

553
00:23:58,071 --> 00:23:59,420
well,
10 years ago you tweeted that,

554
00:23:59,421 --> 00:24:00,254
this and that and but I prefer to take a
more courageous approach to it and you 

555
00:24:03,201 --> 00:24:04,100
know,
the,

556
00:24:04,140 --> 00:24:07,130
the proper response to outreach to our 
rich cultures to be outrageous.

557
00:24:07,131 --> 00:24:08,480
Right?
I prefer to double down.

558
00:24:08,481 --> 00:24:10,340
If somebody says that they find 
something offensive,

559
00:24:10,341 --> 00:24:14,060
I will tell a joke twice as bad because 
words don't hurt you.

560
00:24:15,150 --> 00:24:17,600
You get a certain leash though.
Being British and gay,

561
00:24:17,601 --> 00:24:19,700
I think it gives you a certain leash.
That was,

562
00:24:19,730 --> 00:24:21,600
I like to think it's my.
It's my,

563
00:24:21,660 --> 00:24:26,180
my hard work and a and fact based 
argument,

564
00:24:26,450 --> 00:24:27,283
a reason,
but recognize it's probably got more to 

565
00:24:29,841 --> 00:24:32,110
do with my good looks hair,
my hair.

566
00:24:32,260 --> 00:24:32,781
No,
but you.

567
00:24:32,781 --> 00:24:35,810
You do get a certain leash because of 
your persona.

568
00:24:35,811 --> 00:24:39,260
Now you've built that yourself,
so I don't mean that to discredit you in

569
00:24:39,261 --> 00:24:41,540
any way.
And I know how hard you misleading word.

570
00:24:41,541 --> 00:24:45,140
I've always been this ridiculous.
Didn't make you see.

571
00:24:45,290 --> 00:24:47,480
I feel that the regressives made me like
this.

572
00:24:47,481 --> 00:24:50,130
You feel you were born this way.
I was born ridiculous.

573
00:24:50,580 --> 00:24:51,530
No,
I was born with it.

574
00:24:51,531 --> 00:24:52,364
We're forcing ridiculousness upon you 
because you have to make a point to the 

575
00:24:54,741 --> 00:24:57,500
crazy people that you have to try to 
live with.

576
00:24:57,690 --> 00:24:58,160
So.
All right.

577
00:24:58,160 --> 00:25:00,290
Let's back up a little bit because I 
want to talk a little bit more about the

578
00:25:00,291 --> 00:25:01,124
social media companies themselves.
So you've made a good point about 

579
00:25:03,411 --> 00:25:05,420
twitter.
I mean there's no doubt that twitter,

580
00:25:05,421 --> 00:25:08,600
we know that their shadow banning right.
Whereas people are popular.

581
00:25:08,601 --> 00:25:11,660
People who say unpopular things suddenly
just don't show up in time,

582
00:25:11,661 --> 00:25:12,494
wondered about people wondered about 
this for awhile and I was the one that 

583
00:25:14,241 --> 00:25:15,074
broke the story because I had 
confirmation from multiple people that 

584
00:25:18,351 --> 00:25:21,500
they work with very closely saying 
twitter admitted,

585
00:25:21,530 --> 00:25:23,510
yes,
we absolutely do do this.

586
00:25:23,990 --> 00:25:27,230
We white list certain accounts so they 
show up in the top of search results and

587
00:25:27,231 --> 00:25:30,280
we blacklists some accounts.
So they jumped and you know,

588
00:25:30,290 --> 00:25:32,240
this is not in question.
It's not a,

589
00:25:32,241 --> 00:25:34,550
it's not a conspiracy theory of many 
things on twitter.

590
00:25:34,820 --> 00:25:36,310
Feel a bit like conspiracies.
Yeah.

591
00:25:36,590 --> 00:25:38,090
Oh,
the band under the Hashtag.

592
00:25:38,091 --> 00:25:41,110
And sometimes they might have done and 
sometimes they've definitely didn't.

593
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:43,740
And who now I'm pretty sure they're 
fiddling around with the regressive left

594
00:25:43,741 --> 00:25:45,380
tash that they offered.
Um,

595
00:25:45,950 --> 00:25:46,783
there's no question whatsoever because 
they've admitted to two sources that 

596
00:25:50,331 --> 00:25:52,000
have come to us that we've,
we've,

597
00:25:52,060 --> 00:25:53,080
we've published as a result,
you know,

598
00:25:53,990 --> 00:25:54,823
they've admitted that they actively 
manipulate their network in order to 

599
00:25:58,821 --> 00:26:01,580
favor people they like and often our 
business partners,

600
00:26:01,581 --> 00:26:03,590
but it's also people that they're like 
ideologically.

601
00:26:03,591 --> 00:26:08,591
So that really is 1984 kinds of stuff 
for what we can have in 2016.

602
00:26:09,140 --> 00:26:12,850
This type of manipulating either we're 
talking definitely entitled to do it.

603
00:26:12,860 --> 00:26:15,920
You just need to stop lying about it.
It's perfectly entitled to do.

604
00:26:15,921 --> 00:26:17,120
If they want to run their network like 
that,

605
00:26:17,121 --> 00:26:18,470
fine.
The business will collapse.

606
00:26:18,471 --> 00:26:19,304
The Conservatives are all even and most 
liberal is actually also want to win on 

607
00:26:21,711 --> 00:26:22,544
the merits.
They don't want.

608
00:26:22,580 --> 00:26:24,180
They don't want the game to be rigged 
right there.

609
00:26:24,450 --> 00:26:26,180
I mean,
I like to think most liberals,

610
00:26:26,210 --> 00:26:27,410
a nice,
decent,

611
00:26:27,411 --> 00:26:29,420
honest people who would like to win on 
the merits.

612
00:26:29,421 --> 00:26:30,254
I think most don't.
I haven't seen much evidence of that in 

613
00:26:31,761 --> 00:26:34,040
the last 10 years.
We will get hijacked.

614
00:26:34,041 --> 00:26:36,020
I really am a firm.
I mean I see what's happening.

615
00:26:36,030 --> 00:26:40,370
Haven't been hijacked.
You see that I have so many friends like

616
00:26:40,371 --> 00:26:43,600
this and you're all idiots.
That's very clear.

617
00:26:43,830 --> 00:26:45,420
Movement has left you behind.
There's no space,

618
00:26:45,450 --> 00:26:47,940
no space for free speech on the left and
not just this bit of the left.

619
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:49,073
Most of the left you are in a tiny slice
on the left of people who still care 

620
00:26:52,501 --> 00:26:53,850
about reason,
rigor,

621
00:26:54,090 --> 00:26:57,750
fact scrutiny and free speech and there 
is no place for you on the left anymore,

622
00:26:57,751 --> 00:27:00,900
so you need to come over and you need to
just just just given,

623
00:27:01,410 --> 00:27:02,243
given I understand that you were going 
to do the whole like I'm a liberal who 

624
00:27:06,391 --> 00:27:08,100
believes in free speech thing is good 
marketing,

625
00:27:08,101 --> 00:27:08,934
but give it up there seriously because 
there's nothing for you on the left 

626
00:27:11,281 --> 00:27:12,360
anymore.
Well,

627
00:27:12,370 --> 00:27:14,790
but that's why they don't even like 
cute.

628
00:27:14,980 --> 00:27:15,813
They don't like you.
They decided now that if you're gay but 

629
00:27:19,081 --> 00:27:22,470
you're white and a man,
the white man bits of the privileged gay

630
00:27:22,630 --> 00:27:25,080
bits and now they're telling us that 
our.

631
00:27:25,290 --> 00:27:28,020
Now they're telling us that our sexual 
preferences are racist.

632
00:27:28,021 --> 00:27:29,580
Like if you've gotten your grindr 
profile,

633
00:27:29,581 --> 00:27:30,750
I could prefer white guys.

634
00:27:31,010 --> 00:27:32,250
And I wrote,
I wrote a column on this.

635
00:27:32,251 --> 00:27:33,900
It says,
the only job I've ever had censored.

636
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:37,830
My employers are wonderful,
so supportive and brilliant.

637
00:27:37,831 --> 00:27:39,030
They let me write whatever the hell I 
want with it.

638
00:27:39,031 --> 00:27:40,980
This is the one that they said,
are you sure you want to do that?

639
00:27:41,250 --> 00:27:44,250
I sort of what my grindr profile says 
blackstone is that racist.

640
00:27:44,390 --> 00:27:45,900
Uh,
although of course I wouldn't put blacks

641
00:27:45,901 --> 00:27:47,250
only because that might put some people 
off.

642
00:27:47,251 --> 00:27:49,140
I'll do words that create the same 
effect,

643
00:27:49,141 --> 00:27:49,974
you know,
like don't contact me if you are under 

644
00:27:50,971 --> 00:27:52,200
seven inches and you know,
your dad is.

645
00:27:53,020 --> 00:27:54,770
So again,
that was the energy,

646
00:27:54,820 --> 00:27:57,450
the energy that they're now policing our
sexuality,

647
00:27:57,451 --> 00:27:58,480
you know,
and you know,

648
00:27:58,650 --> 00:28:00,710
you straight white gay men.
Well,

649
00:28:00,740 --> 00:28:02,310
well it's the straight white bit.
That's the problem.

650
00:28:02,610 --> 00:28:03,300
So that the.
Sorry,

651
00:28:03,300 --> 00:28:05,550
the white gay men and difficult to keep 
up with it.

652
00:28:05,580 --> 00:28:07,470
It's a lot.
It's a lot.

653
00:28:07,471 --> 00:28:08,480
It's a lot.
So is that.

654
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:12,240
So that's sort of what I see with this 
ideology.

655
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:14,920
I know you're going to work this next 
hour you're going to be working,

656
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:18,330
but when I see the problem is,
is that there's never an end to it.

657
00:28:18,331 --> 00:28:19,164
So they sort of used gays to get a 
little more power and now they're done 

658
00:28:22,531 --> 00:28:22,861
with.
Well,

659
00:28:22,861 --> 00:28:23,694
you've now that you're saying right now,
realize that what we discussed in our 

660
00:28:26,101 --> 00:28:26,934
last show you were completely wrong and 
I was completely right to and I said 

661
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:30,193
that you were part of the problem that 
you had bought out into this sort of 

662
00:28:31,681 --> 00:28:34,320
domestication of homosexuals.
The liberals just want to plunk you down

663
00:28:34,321 --> 00:28:35,640
in gay areas there.
Where do you live?

664
00:28:35,641 --> 00:28:36,474
You lived at Gary.
Daniel,

665
00:28:36,730 --> 00:28:38,360
of course,
of course you do a,

666
00:28:38,361 --> 00:28:39,194
you know,
plunk you down with your dog and your 

667
00:28:40,231 --> 00:28:41,710
husband and you know,
you're nice lighting,

668
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:43,530
nice domestic life and now they've got 
you.

669
00:28:43,590 --> 00:28:45,600
Now they've got you.
You'll be a democrat voter forever.

670
00:28:46,110 --> 00:28:46,943
It's easy.
Like they can move onto the next group 

671
00:28:47,971 --> 00:28:48,804
and then just got you in the bag and the
whole point we talked about last time 

672
00:28:50,941 --> 00:28:53,040
about sort of dissident.
I'm gay culture,

673
00:28:53,041 --> 00:28:54,840
but the most exciting people being the 
free thinkers.

674
00:28:54,841 --> 00:28:56,460
I think you're now starting to realize I
was right,

675
00:28:56,461 --> 00:28:57,660
which is lovely.
Very gratifying for me.

676
00:28:57,720 --> 00:28:58,610
Wonderful.
Oh,

677
00:28:58,630 --> 00:29:01,230
I realized that the left leg,
he was six months ahead.

678
00:29:01,231 --> 00:29:02,880
Again,
we'll look.

679
00:29:02,881 --> 00:29:03,714
I realized without question that the 
left has lost its mind as to the point 

680
00:29:06,991 --> 00:29:07,824
that it's a slice like this.
I do think that the fight that my side 

681
00:29:11,431 --> 00:29:14,640
of this on the left is starting to wake 
up in big numbers,

682
00:29:14,790 --> 00:29:15,623
so I don't think we all have to somehow 
defect to you guys just yet as much as 

683
00:29:19,201 --> 00:29:20,430
you'd like to you guys.

684
00:29:20,430 --> 00:29:21,660
I mean,
I'm not a Republican.

685
00:29:21,661 --> 00:29:22,494
I mean I'm,
I,

686
00:29:22,500 --> 00:29:24,500
I,
I'm British for stock.

687
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:26,940
Might even vote here.
I'm a daddy supporter,

688
00:29:26,941 --> 00:29:27,774
but yeah,
we're going to get to your daddy called 

689
00:29:30,060 --> 00:29:31,410
trump daddy.
Everybody knows this now.

690
00:29:31,670 --> 00:29:32,503
I'm so just wrapping up the social media
stuff and free speech related to these 

691
00:29:36,331 --> 00:29:37,164
companies.
If these companies are run by these 

692
00:29:39,211 --> 00:29:41,440
social justice warriors and it really 
does seem like,

693
00:29:41,500 --> 00:29:42,333
look,
I don't want to lose my twitter 

694
00:29:42,970 --> 00:29:46,330
verification so I don't get great lose 
it.

695
00:29:46,340 --> 00:29:47,320
You're going to go.
So look,

696
00:29:47,321 --> 00:29:48,154
I don't want to lose that and I and I 
don't want to be banned on facebook and 

697
00:29:50,651 --> 00:29:51,161
I,
you know,

698
00:29:51,161 --> 00:29:51,994
we put our videos up on youtube 
obviously I saw last week or two weeks 

699
00:29:55,271 --> 00:29:56,104
ago.
There was this organization that does 

700
00:29:57,581 --> 00:30:00,730
translations from Arabic,
uh,

701
00:30:00,731 --> 00:30:01,564
and they,
all they do is translate what moms are 

702
00:30:03,521 --> 00:30:07,140
saying and mosques or telling about 
killing all the Jews and killing all the

703
00:30:07,150 --> 00:30:09,880
gates and they got banned for hate 
speech.

704
00:30:09,880 --> 00:30:10,713
All they do is translate the hate speech
enough want you should know what the 

705
00:30:14,171 --> 00:30:15,004
Muslims are saying.
They don't want you to know what's 

706
00:30:16,031 --> 00:30:18,070
happening in these mos because if people
knew about it,

707
00:30:18,071 --> 00:30:19,810
they might be less happy with this.
You know,

708
00:30:19,811 --> 00:30:20,644
this huge influx of immigration.
They might be less happy about having 

709
00:30:23,201 --> 00:30:24,970
their own perfectly reasonable points of
view.

710
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:28,420
Censored and mischaracterized as hate 
speech.

711
00:30:28,421 --> 00:30:29,254
I mean this is what the left does.
It mischaracterizes ridicule and 

712
00:30:32,021 --> 00:30:32,854
criticism is abuse and harassment.
It can mischaracterize is perfectly 

713
00:30:35,111 --> 00:30:35,944
valid,
ordinary anxieties that regular people 

714
00:30:37,540 --> 00:30:38,373
are justified in having as hate speech.
I'm looking at on the world now and I'm 

715
00:30:41,681 --> 00:30:45,730
thinking people like Tommy Robinson from
the edl,

716
00:30:45,930 --> 00:30:46,763
he's been on the show,
Brian and I'm thinking there was some 

717
00:30:49,331 --> 00:30:50,950
things he said in the nineties and 
whatever.

718
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:54,730
It was fun too much and the violence is 
obviously obviously unacceptable,

719
00:30:54,731 --> 00:30:56,720
but I'm listening to him now and people,
oh,

720
00:30:56,740 --> 00:30:58,120
Tommy Robinson has racist pig.

721
00:30:58,120 --> 00:31:00,580
I'm just gonna say now I can't find 
anything to disagree with.

722
00:31:01,270 --> 00:31:02,103
I can't find anything to disagree with 
it in his speech when he went to Oxford 

723
00:31:05,230 --> 00:31:06,460
University,
mapped out his,

724
00:31:06,490 --> 00:31:07,323
his life and what he,
how he saw his community changing and 

725
00:31:08,921 --> 00:31:10,370
how he saw the police.
Uh,

726
00:31:10,390 --> 00:31:12,100
either hamstrung or actively lying about
it.

727
00:31:12,101 --> 00:31:14,090
The government lying about it,
the media lying about it.

728
00:31:14,300 --> 00:31:16,240
And all this stuff is now playing out in
social media.

729
00:31:16,241 --> 00:31:19,420
And the scary thing about these 
companies is that they are totally,

730
00:31:20,090 --> 00:31:23,200
totally.
They are in lockstep with government,

731
00:31:23,860 --> 00:31:25,120
facebook,
Germany,

732
00:31:25,450 --> 00:31:26,800
lockstep with,
with,

733
00:31:26,801 --> 00:31:27,710
uh,
with Merkel,

734
00:31:28,030 --> 00:31:29,830
there video of,
of Zuckerberg,

735
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:32,590
Mark Zuckerberg,
you know,

736
00:31:32,870 --> 00:31:34,640
twitter here,
locks.

737
00:31:34,940 --> 00:31:36,960
They have meetings all day everyday with
this,

738
00:31:37,050 --> 00:31:37,880
you know,
with,

739
00:31:37,880 --> 00:31:40,060
um,
with government officials at lockstep on

740
00:31:40,061 --> 00:31:41,160
this stuff.
Um,

741
00:31:41,230 --> 00:31:42,580
I don't know what they're going to do 
when,

742
00:31:42,660 --> 00:31:44,200
when daddy gets into the White House,
but,

743
00:31:44,490 --> 00:31:45,700
um,
but no,

744
00:31:45,701 --> 00:31:46,270
it's terrible.

745
00:31:46,270 --> 00:31:47,380
I should tell people,
when you say data,

746
00:31:47,381 --> 00:31:48,214
you're talking trump,
just for the people that don't know all 

747
00:31:49,400 --> 00:31:50,233
your lingo,
everyone just yet they're referring to 

748
00:31:51,581 --> 00:31:52,414
trump will get to for I'm referring to 
the God emperor trump it as the God 

749
00:31:54,821 --> 00:31:56,790
emperor and his incoming trump and 
riker.

750
00:31:56,830 --> 00:32:00,160
So I've realized if I accomplish nothing
else with you while sitting here,

751
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:01,233
I want you,
we've accomplished nothing so nothing 

752
00:32:03,281 --> 00:32:04,114
happens over night,
but I want you to at least make the 

753
00:32:05,660 --> 00:32:06,493
different distinction between when you 
talk about the left and leftists versus 

754
00:32:11,170 --> 00:32:12,530
liberals,
you know,

755
00:32:13,210 --> 00:32:15,250
really don't see those.
I don't want to make that distinction.

756
00:32:15,251 --> 00:32:17,860
So you just think I'm just the outlier 
of this situation.

757
00:32:17,861 --> 00:32:19,310
But yeah,
I know.

758
00:32:19,320 --> 00:32:21,140
I know I'm the outlier,
but he does $50,

759
00:32:21,150 --> 00:32:22,460
million viewers.
Then I will,

760
00:32:22,470 --> 00:32:24,010
whatever the hell numbers they have this
wheel.

761
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:25,570
If someone's people didn't come from 
nowhere,

762
00:32:25,571 --> 00:32:26,404
that's what the left is,
that you don't belong there and I 

763
00:32:29,831 --> 00:32:30,960
wouldn't call those people liberal.

764
00:32:30,980 --> 00:32:35,170
It's more of a work of linguistic 
history that the American left,

765
00:32:35,220 --> 00:32:36,053
his called is called the liberal 
movement because they don't believe in 

766
00:32:38,111 --> 00:32:39,040
liberalism.
The not classical,

767
00:32:39,650 --> 00:32:40,520
but I'm sorry,
you know,

768
00:32:40,521 --> 00:32:41,354
arguing over words like the left likes 
to do isn't going to change the fact 

769
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:49,160
that the entire left side of the 
American political spectrum has gone mad

770
00:32:49,510 --> 00:32:50,600
and if you,
you know,

771
00:32:50,690 --> 00:32:54,110
you just can't in good conscience vote 
Democrat and if you've,

772
00:32:54,140 --> 00:32:54,973
you know,
if you don't believe in any of this 

773
00:32:55,701 --> 00:32:56,534
stuff,
if you want us to be able to have 

774
00:32:57,531 --> 00:33:00,200
discussions like this,
not just on your show,

775
00:33:00,290 --> 00:33:02,510
but on the national news and in the 
pages of the newspapers,

776
00:33:02,511 --> 00:33:04,640
if you believe in that,
you cannot vote Democrat.

777
00:33:04,641 --> 00:33:07,040
Well that's where these motherfuckers 
have caught me.

778
00:33:07,041 --> 00:33:10,280
They've really pushed me into a corner 
here because everything,

779
00:33:10,430 --> 00:33:12,050
all the,
all the free speech stuff,

780
00:33:12,051 --> 00:33:12,650
right?

781
00:33:12,650 --> 00:33:14,420
You know,
fighting against the ideology,

782
00:33:14,421 --> 00:33:15,800
secularism,
all of that stuff.

783
00:33:15,801 --> 00:33:17,480
That's right.
That's my stuff.

784
00:33:17,481 --> 00:33:20,750
That's the stuff I really care about.
The crazy on the left.

785
00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:23,360
So the left right now is crazy on this 
stuff I care about most.

786
00:33:23,480 --> 00:33:25,460
And I say that as someone that has 
never,

787
00:33:25,580 --> 00:33:29,630
not voted democratic ever.
And here we are so that now,

788
00:33:29,930 --> 00:33:32,470
as I've scared you is.
This is the Segue,

789
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:33,740
the table.
There's a table where.

790
00:33:33,741 --> 00:33:34,410
Okay.
Yeah,

791
00:33:34,410 --> 00:33:36,080
so let's,
let's move on to trump.

792
00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:38,240
So when,
when you were here in October,

793
00:33:39,230 --> 00:33:42,440
I think you were just starting to get 
behind the trump movement,

794
00:33:42,441 --> 00:33:43,274
but at that time was at that time I 
wasn't sure at that time he had had 

795
00:33:47,110 --> 00:33:47,943
maybe had one or two debates.
Everybody was still saying this was a 

796
00:33:51,561 --> 00:33:52,394
joke.
I think I was still saying it was a 

797
00:33:53,391 --> 00:33:55,250
joke.
It's clearly not a joke.

798
00:33:55,260 --> 00:33:57,500
And what does it was that great 
Beaumont,

799
00:33:57,690 --> 00:33:58,770
like no one's loving now.

800
00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:02,410
Actually we all,
you know,

801
00:34:02,420 --> 00:34:04,100
generation trump are having a great 
time.

802
00:34:04,101 --> 00:34:05,240
Yeah.
You guys are having a great time.

803
00:34:05,241 --> 00:34:07,180
Where the only people who all who all 
laughing.

804
00:34:07,500 --> 00:34:09,770
No,
I did your show and I did Joe Rogan,

805
00:34:09,780 --> 00:34:10,613
who's also great.
I did his show and at that time I was 

806
00:34:12,471 --> 00:34:12,921
like,
well,

807
00:34:12,921 --> 00:34:14,540
do I really want trump in the White 
House on North shore?

808
00:34:14,730 --> 00:34:15,680
Right?
I'm sure about that,

809
00:34:15,860 --> 00:34:18,380
but I'm enjoying the spectacle.
My views have evolved.

810
00:34:20,210 --> 00:34:21,380
The evolution.
Well,

811
00:34:21,381 --> 00:34:22,214
you see,
I care about all the things that you 

812
00:34:23,151 --> 00:34:23,984
care about and I see the best way to 
accomplish what we collectively want to 

813
00:34:28,340 --> 00:34:30,760
throw our lot in with,

814
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:35,120
with the politician that doesn't know,
like the rest of them,

815
00:34:35,150 --> 00:34:36,860
that it terrifies the rest of them.
I mean,

816
00:34:36,861 --> 00:34:37,694
the prospect of a trump candidacy,
the prospect of a trump presidency 

817
00:34:41,290 --> 00:34:43,700
terrifies not just liberals or 
conservatives to,

818
00:34:43,701 --> 00:34:47,480
because he's,
he threatens to blow apart the political

819
00:34:47,481 --> 00:34:49,150
consensus to blow apart.
I mean,

820
00:34:49,160 --> 00:34:51,500
fiscal crisis in particular,
if you believe as I do,

821
00:34:51,501 --> 00:34:53,630
that is one of the great cancers of 
public life.

822
00:34:53,840 --> 00:34:58,070
There's nobody better situated to have 
fun with that than trump.

823
00:34:58,370 --> 00:35:00,100
If you believe that,
um,

824
00:35:00,140 --> 00:35:01,910
you know,
not just the left but the right has lost

825
00:35:01,911 --> 00:35:03,620
it's way too.
If you believe that,

826
00:35:04,180 --> 00:35:05,580
let's,
let's do one of these at a time.

827
00:35:05,581 --> 00:35:08,070
So if you believe that you want to just 
blow the system apart,

828
00:35:08,071 --> 00:35:09,190
you're the first thing that you 
mentioned.

829
00:35:09,900 --> 00:35:11,580
I'm an engine of chaos.
I think they're all.

830
00:35:11,910 --> 00:35:13,830
Am I allowed to say you're in.
You can say whatever.

831
00:35:13,840 --> 00:35:14,673
You know what I want.
So you're like the joker in Batman in 

832
00:35:17,101 --> 00:35:17,760
the movie,
right?

833
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:19,960
He just wanted to say that.
And then I stopped.

834
00:35:20,860 --> 00:35:24,540
That counts.
So you want to burn.

835
00:35:24,541 --> 00:35:26,400
So basically you would want to burn the 
system.

836
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:27,633
See

837
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:31,660
Gop politicians telling CNN reports,
I think it was CNN,

838
00:35:31,690 --> 00:35:33,820
you know,
the public doesn't pick the candidate.

839
00:35:33,870 --> 00:35:36,100
Will we pick the candidate?
I just think to myself,

840
00:35:36,101 --> 00:35:40,680
you deserve to know these people don't 
like the public.

841
00:35:40,860 --> 00:35:41,693
They don't like their own electorates.
And the Republican Party has become as 

842
00:35:44,701 --> 00:35:49,020
hostile to its own base as,
as liberals have always been.

843
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:50,033
They started talking about their own 
base in the same way that liberals 

844
00:35:51,871 --> 00:35:53,070
always have.
Um,

845
00:35:53,130 --> 00:35:53,963
you've got National Review publishing 
disgusting things about why white 

846
00:35:56,581 --> 00:35:59,850
working class Americans just awful.
These people aren't going away.

847
00:35:59,980 --> 00:36:00,813
Uh,
and these people are angry and 

848
00:36:01,471 --> 00:36:03,720
frustrated and it was interesting about 
trump,

849
00:36:03,721 --> 00:36:07,410
I think has captured the imagination of 
a huge swathe of the population,

850
00:36:07,820 --> 00:36:08,653
um,
from what you might call traditional 

851
00:36:10,471 --> 00:36:11,700
trump supporters.
You know,

852
00:36:11,710 --> 00:36:13,140
the,
the veterans,

853
00:36:13,620 --> 00:36:14,453
you know,
the white working classes who feel very 

854
00:36:15,390 --> 00:36:16,223
disoriented by this new globalized world
and very concerned about mass 

855
00:36:19,111 --> 00:36:22,140
immigration for wage reasons,
for cultural reasons too,

856
00:36:22,170 --> 00:36:23,190
and they're right to be considered.

857
00:36:23,190 --> 00:36:24,023
Those are just the,
that,

858
00:36:24,040 --> 00:36:27,150
both of those,
both of those accounts but,

859
00:36:27,240 --> 00:36:29,550
and the question I always get asked,
and I don't mean to disrespect that,

860
00:36:29,600 --> 00:36:31,840
that group at all because that group is,
is,

861
00:36:31,930 --> 00:36:35,540
is my readership and I love them when 
people ask me what is smart people about

862
00:36:35,550 --> 00:36:36,211
trump,
what they mean is,

863
00:36:36,211 --> 00:36:37,580
what if people like us for trump,
you know,

864
00:36:37,590 --> 00:36:39,240
we're not because we're not supposed to.
Right?

865
00:36:39,550 --> 00:36:40,101
We're not,
not you.

866
00:36:40,101 --> 00:36:42,750
I mean obviously not you,
but why do people like me vote?

867
00:36:43,150 --> 00:36:46,080
Why would I vote trump?
Why do you know media types?

868
00:36:46,081 --> 00:36:47,530
Fuck trump.
And the,

869
00:36:47,531 --> 00:36:48,364
the answer to that is he represents the 
best hope we have of smashing political 

870
00:36:52,861 --> 00:36:56,520
correctness apart of breaking open.
You know,

871
00:36:56,610 --> 00:36:57,443
all of the taboos,
the things stuff you're not supposed to 

872
00:36:58,981 --> 00:37:01,230
say,
and allowing real debate to be had.

873
00:37:01,231 --> 00:37:02,064
Again today.
It is impossible in America to have an 

874
00:37:05,010 --> 00:37:05,843
honest discussion about the wage gap,
about whether or not men and women get 

875
00:37:08,971 --> 00:37:11,700
paid different amounts of money and we 
won't get into that today,

876
00:37:12,120 --> 00:37:16,320
but what we can't use radical Islam as a
more relevant example.

877
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:17,153
You can't have an honest discussion.
You would lose your job or you wouldn't 

878
00:37:19,441 --> 00:37:21,000
get it back.
You'll never get a comment.

879
00:37:21,001 --> 00:37:21,834
National newspaper,
the overton window is so narrow and 

880
00:37:24,091 --> 00:37:25,970
pushed so far to the left,
um,

881
00:37:26,040 --> 00:37:30,720
that something big has to happen.
A big tumultuous event needs to happen.

882
00:37:30,721 --> 00:37:31,554
And I believe that that event is a trump
presidency because I think it will 

883
00:37:33,541 --> 00:37:35,820
destroy the Republican Party that will 
never win another election,

884
00:37:35,821 --> 00:37:36,654
which is what I want.
And I think the same thing will happen 

885
00:37:37,711 --> 00:37:39,040
on the left too with,
you know,

886
00:37:39,090 --> 00:37:41,880
the Sanders Hilary kind of tearing 
comment on the left.

887
00:37:41,881 --> 00:37:43,200
I have what I want.
Yeah,

888
00:37:43,470 --> 00:37:47,490
and I think this might be what you want.
What I want is a source of new political

889
00:37:47,491 --> 00:37:51,060
realignment on Libertarian authoritarian
lines rather than left and right.

890
00:37:51,360 --> 00:37:54,060
And I want a new consensus to emerge.
A disaffected liberals,

891
00:37:54,120 --> 00:37:55,140
classical liberals.

892
00:37:55,780 --> 00:37:58,370
You know,
dissident minorities like gays,

893
00:37:59,160 --> 00:38:01,080
you know,
a small state conservatives,

894
00:38:01,081 --> 00:38:01,914
libertarians,
people who basically want to be left 

895
00:38:03,391 --> 00:38:04,224
alone,
people who believe that government 

896
00:38:05,491 --> 00:38:09,050
should have some limited functions,
but our culture should not be policed on

897
00:38:09,060 --> 00:38:09,900
language,
not be police.

898
00:38:09,910 --> 00:38:11,910
We should be able to do be,
say,

899
00:38:11,911 --> 00:38:14,520
think and act exactly as we pleased.
Now,

900
00:38:14,521 --> 00:38:15,354
I believe there is a majority in this 
country who would get behind that sort 

901
00:38:18,631 --> 00:38:19,464
of cultural insurgency.
And this election is the first election 

902
00:38:23,041 --> 00:38:27,150
in American history that has been fought
not on foreign policy and on economics.

903
00:38:27,151 --> 00:38:30,510
It's being fought culturally.
It's been edited and it is being a,

904
00:38:30,511 --> 00:38:31,344
it has been excited.
It has been stirred up by a cultural 

905
00:38:34,201 --> 00:38:36,390
figure by reality TV star,
by a,

906
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:38,020
you know,
an American icon.

907
00:38:38,570 --> 00:38:39,403
Um,
I've come around to believe that 

908
00:38:42,071 --> 00:38:42,904
actually having trump in the White House
would be wonderful and if he finds 

909
00:38:47,111 --> 00:38:47,944
himself in the White House and isn't 
able to achieve very much inside of me 

910
00:38:49,931 --> 00:38:52,660
is going to daddy's gonna build a wall 
and that is going to fix trade.

911
00:38:52,750 --> 00:38:53,583
And that's gonna happen.
If then things start locking up because 

912
00:38:56,561 --> 00:38:58,380
he's got a noncompliant,
you know,

913
00:38:58,390 --> 00:39:01,180
left and right in all the various 
machinery of government.

914
00:39:01,480 --> 00:39:03,370
I don't see that as a particularly bad 
thing.

915
00:39:03,610 --> 00:39:05,470
One of the best presidents in history 
was coolidge.

916
00:39:05,471 --> 00:39:07,360
Why?
Because he did absolutely nothing.

917
00:39:07,560 --> 00:39:08,393
Um,
you know,

918
00:39:08,890 --> 00:39:09,723
having some,
having like a cooler with bluster would 

919
00:39:10,991 --> 00:39:11,824
be no bad thing and all of the 
criticisms that are normally leveled at 

920
00:39:14,351 --> 00:39:15,184
trump,
all of the stuff that people say 

921
00:39:15,850 --> 00:39:18,700
clownish and his populous,
I don't see those things.

922
00:39:18,850 --> 00:39:22,780
Uh,
as intrinsically I'm anti presidential.

923
00:39:22,920 --> 00:39:23,590
I mean,
in fact,

924
00:39:23,590 --> 00:39:26,140
presidential material is very much in 
the eye and the eye of the beholder.

925
00:39:26,141 --> 00:39:28,270
And clearly there are enough Americans 
who do believe,

926
00:39:28,610 --> 00:39:29,580
um,
that,

927
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:30,753
that trump is presidential.
What's really exciting about trump is 

928
00:39:33,491 --> 00:39:36,520
that he is to the same in the same way 
that we are,

929
00:39:36,521 --> 00:39:37,990
I think.
And I definitely am.

930
00:39:38,440 --> 00:39:41,860
I'm trump is a direct creation of the 
progressive left.

931
00:39:42,340 --> 00:39:43,173
He has been brought about.
He exists because of the people that we 

932
00:39:46,271 --> 00:39:47,090
both hate.

933
00:39:47,090 --> 00:39:50,280
So I'm with you.
There had been saying for a long time,

934
00:39:50,460 --> 00:39:54,480
bullied and policed and and harangued 
and hectored,

935
00:39:54,481 --> 00:39:55,314
a name called for so long.
They've told people that they are 

936
00:39:59,190 --> 00:40:01,020
homophobes when they're not.
They're topical,

937
00:40:01,040 --> 00:40:02,680
they're sexist when they're not.
They're topical,

938
00:40:02,730 --> 00:40:04,010
they're racist.
When they're not there.

939
00:40:04,020 --> 00:40:06,000
Tell people they're transphobic and they
don't even know what that means.

940
00:40:06,130 --> 00:40:08,680
Yeah.
They'd be bringing out all the heavy,

941
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:11,340
heavy weapons here to bring the over 
because I get this.

942
00:40:11,341 --> 00:40:15,930
You're going to the.
This is exactly what I'd want to use the

943
00:40:15,931 --> 00:40:17,940
left because I didn't want this to 
happen.

944
00:40:18,030 --> 00:40:19,140
Well,
it's too late now,

945
00:40:19,141 --> 00:40:19,974
buddy.
So you either get on the train or you 

946
00:40:23,701 --> 00:40:24,690
know,
who cares.

947
00:40:24,840 --> 00:40:27,930
Okay.
So what do you not see some risk.

948
00:40:27,990 --> 00:40:28,823
Even if I grant you all of that and you 
say a lot of them questioning in order 

949
00:40:31,981 --> 00:40:35,280
to seem to have seem to have grown too.
Even if I grant you all of that,

950
00:40:35,281 --> 00:40:36,114
do you think that there is some risk 
that by unearthing all of the ways we 

951
00:40:41,941 --> 00:40:43,350
speak to each other?
Again,

952
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:46,740
I say this as the most pro free speech 
person there is.

953
00:40:47,070 --> 00:40:51,390
I am definitely now seeing a real 
current of racism rising up,

954
00:40:51,420 --> 00:40:52,253
a real current of,
of really hating Muslims of really 

955
00:40:55,111 --> 00:40:56,800
hating Jews have really.
I mean,

956
00:40:56,870 --> 00:40:57,703
I'm seeing it bubble up on social media.
I don't think you're misreading the 

957
00:40:59,401 --> 00:41:00,210
situation.
So.

958
00:41:00,210 --> 00:41:01,930
So how am I misreading that?
Well,

959
00:41:02,210 --> 00:41:03,050
uh,
oh,

960
00:41:03,100 --> 00:41:05,260
are we not worried about this stuff 
bubbling up isn't bubble.

961
00:41:05,330 --> 00:41:06,430
It is,
but it's always been.

962
00:41:06,760 --> 00:41:07,780
It's always there.
You know,

963
00:41:07,781 --> 00:41:10,490
people have prejudices about people 
sometimes there's prejudices.

964
00:41:10,600 --> 00:41:11,760
All right.
Uh,

965
00:41:11,860 --> 00:41:14,910
when I was speaking at rutgers,
somebody in one of the,

966
00:41:14,950 --> 00:41:15,850
one of the students,
I said,

967
00:41:15,851 --> 00:41:16,421
well,
you know,

968
00:41:16,421 --> 00:41:19,600
there are studies that show that,
that white people think black people are

969
00:41:19,601 --> 00:41:21,310
loud and obnoxious,
you know,

970
00:41:21,311 --> 00:41:24,130
and that's racist and maybe that's a 
cultural thing.

971
00:41:24,170 --> 00:41:25,003
Black people do use language differently
and they just couldn't wrap their head 

972
00:41:26,531 --> 00:41:27,364
around the fact that,
so that a prejudice might be right now 

973
00:41:28,601 --> 00:41:31,300
it's what you do with that sort of 
assumption or prejudice or whatever.

974
00:41:31,630 --> 00:41:33,420
Um,
that the,

975
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:34,550
the masses.
Okay.

976
00:41:34,670 --> 00:41:39,000
It may be that the two things to say on 
this right,

977
00:41:39,170 --> 00:41:40,003
one is just no hatefulness and racism 
and sexism and homophobia left in this 

978
00:41:45,201 --> 00:41:45,530
country.

979
00:41:45,530 --> 00:41:46,363
Really.
Most of the expression of that kind of 

980
00:41:47,931 --> 00:41:51,080
stuff is driven by the left.
Um,

981
00:41:51,290 --> 00:41:53,480
when it,
it's sort of,

982
00:41:53,730 --> 00:41:54,590
you know,
so you know,

983
00:41:54,591 --> 00:41:55,330
they go,
they go,

984
00:41:55,330 --> 00:41:57,800
they go looking for,
for homophobia.

985
00:41:57,801 --> 00:41:59,170
They call around all these,
you know,

986
00:41:59,420 --> 00:42:03,230
bakeries in the Midwest or whatever.
Finally they find somebody who says,

987
00:42:03,231 --> 00:42:04,470
no,
we'd rather not do a lesbian wedding.

988
00:42:04,471 --> 00:42:05,031
I'm like,
guys,

989
00:42:05,031 --> 00:42:06,830
we found some homophobia.
Excellent.

990
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:08,600
You know,
they go all in on it.

991
00:42:09,290 --> 00:42:10,123
It makes me want to go out and bash 
queers when I say I'm so angry about it 

992
00:42:14,361 --> 00:42:17,420
because it's just such obvious bollocks.
Now the second thing,

993
00:42:17,421 --> 00:42:18,110
and I,
you know,

994
00:42:18,110 --> 00:42:20,300
when you police down like crushed 
people,

995
00:42:20,420 --> 00:42:21,253
it creates,
it creates exactly what you're claiming 

996
00:42:22,581 --> 00:42:23,414
that you are looking for.
And this is sort of kafkaesque for 

997
00:42:25,261 --> 00:42:26,580
bactrian cycle.
The left and the second thing,

998
00:42:26,680 --> 00:42:29,750
we're also using it specifically to 
attack Christians in this case,

999
00:42:29,900 --> 00:42:30,170
right?

1000
00:42:30,170 --> 00:42:31,003
Because you wouldn't go to,
you don't see them going is the article 

1001
00:42:33,680 --> 00:42:36,650
that are interested in the bigotry.
They don't care about fixing bigotry.

1002
00:42:36,651 --> 00:42:39,020
They care about hurting Christians and 
ridiculing Christians.

1003
00:42:39,260 --> 00:42:40,093
That's all true to second thing is your.
You say you're seeing all this stuff 

1004
00:42:43,011 --> 00:42:44,200
bubble up on social media at.
Well,

1005
00:42:44,260 --> 00:42:44,841
I'll.
Let me take the.

1006
00:42:44,841 --> 00:42:47,870
The ultimate example.
What remains the big taboo in society,

1007
00:42:47,871 --> 00:42:49,190
which is Anti Semitism,
right?

1008
00:42:50,540 --> 00:42:53,570
Most of the generation trump,
the outright people,

1009
00:42:53,600 --> 00:42:55,840
so people who like me,
they're not antisemites.

1010
00:42:55,850 --> 00:42:57,710
They don't care about Jews.
They May.

1011
00:42:57,710 --> 00:42:59,390
They may have some assumptions about 
Jews.

1012
00:42:59,391 --> 00:43:02,330
They may have some prejudice about Jews 
that the Jews run everything while we do

1013
00:43:02,570 --> 00:43:04,220
the Jews run all the banks.
What we do,

1014
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:06,080
the Jews run the media.
What we do,

1015
00:43:06,170 --> 00:43:07,003
you know,
I mean they're right about all that 

1016
00:43:07,671 --> 00:43:08,504
stuff.
Now what you do with that is is the 

1017
00:43:09,231 --> 00:43:10,820
issue,
but the reason they go on a parody,

1018
00:43:10,870 --> 00:43:12,620
but where to start with that,
so just go.

1019
00:43:13,680 --> 00:43:16,070
This is not intubate.
It's statistical facts.

1020
00:43:16,080 --> 00:43:17,480
Now the Jews are on most of the banks.
Jews,

1021
00:43:17,540 --> 00:43:20,900
Jews completely dominate the media.
Vastly disproportionately represented in

1022
00:43:20,901 --> 00:43:22,970
all of these professions.
That's just a fact,

1023
00:43:22,971 --> 00:43:25,730
isn't antisense antisemitic to point out
statistics.

1024
00:43:25,910 --> 00:43:27,400
Um,
but you know,

1025
00:43:27,401 --> 00:43:28,460
you seem to have you,
you know,

1026
00:43:28,510 --> 00:43:29,920
you've,
you've missed what,

1027
00:43:30,060 --> 00:43:33,980
what you agree with me on feminism,
like it's not sexist when statistics I'm

1028
00:43:33,981 --> 00:43:34,870
suggesting to you is not,
you know,

1029
00:43:34,871 --> 00:43:37,610
it's not antisemitic to point out that 
these things are true.

1030
00:43:37,611 --> 00:43:39,780
Now the antisemitism on the Internet,
which is really important,

1031
00:43:39,781 --> 00:43:41,810
and I want people to understand this 
because nobody seems to,

1032
00:43:42,260 --> 00:43:44,780
when Jonah Goldberg of now have a 
national review,

1033
00:43:44,781 --> 00:43:47,600
whatever is bombarded by,
um,

1034
00:43:47,620 --> 00:43:48,750
you know,
these memes,

1035
00:43:48,751 --> 00:43:49,461
so like,
you know,

1036
00:43:49,461 --> 00:43:52,160
that whatever it is and you know,
antisemitic,

1037
00:43:52,550 --> 00:43:53,930
take a hike,
all this kind of stuff.

1038
00:43:54,080 --> 00:43:54,913
It's not because there is a gigantic 
outpouring of spontaneous outpouring of 

1039
00:43:57,891 --> 00:43:59,960
antisemitism from 22 year olds in this 
country.

1040
00:44:00,130 --> 00:44:01,650
And what it is,
is the,

1041
00:44:02,120 --> 00:44:02,953
it's a mischievous dissident trolling 
generation who do it because it gets a 

1042
00:44:08,691 --> 00:44:10,070
reaction,
right?

1043
00:44:10,250 --> 00:44:12,920
That's been the case for young people 
for generations.

1044
00:44:12,921 --> 00:44:13,754
It's just that now they have access to 
things that really get under people's 

1045
00:44:15,501 --> 00:44:17,870
skin and Internet scale economics.
And,

1046
00:44:17,900 --> 00:44:18,401
uh,
and,

1047
00:44:18,401 --> 00:44:19,234
and,
uh,

1048
00:44:19,490 --> 00:44:20,323
you know,
viral dynamics and they can get to 

1049
00:44:22,491 --> 00:44:26,300
people in positions of power and people 
in positions of power keep biting and it

1050
00:44:26,301 --> 00:44:28,000
keeps taking the bait that,
you know,

1051
00:44:28,010 --> 00:44:29,540
look,
if you enjoyed that,

1052
00:44:29,770 --> 00:44:30,603
that sort of explain why.
This is what I said at the beginning of 

1053
00:44:31,591 --> 00:44:32,160
the show that you're

1054
00:44:32,160 --> 00:44:36,330
sort of a micro trump to me because your
rise has been.

1055
00:44:36,390 --> 00:44:37,770
I know you want to think you're bigger 
than trump,

1056
00:44:37,771 --> 00:44:38,640
but you're not.
No,

1057
00:44:38,641 --> 00:44:38,950
no,
no,

1058
00:44:38,950 --> 00:44:39,783
no,
no.

1059
00:44:40,770 --> 00:44:41,603
Everybody,
everybody has everybody's daddy to 

1060
00:44:43,181 --> 00:44:44,014
somebody.
I'm very happy to trump to be a better 

1061
00:44:45,631 --> 00:44:47,040
daddy and I'll be daddy to,
you know,

1062
00:44:47,250 --> 00:44:47,981
everybody else.
So.

1063
00:44:47,981 --> 00:44:51,420
But basically what you're saying is that
they're using,

1064
00:44:51,421 --> 00:44:52,254
they're just using the tools to get 
people angry and then it causes another 

1065
00:44:55,231 --> 00:44:56,064
reaction and then there's another 
reaction and that is what it's trolling 

1066
00:45:00,301 --> 00:45:03,000
and this is a direct response to the 
language.

1067
00:45:03,001 --> 00:45:06,690
Policing is a direct response to people 
being told they can't say things.

1068
00:45:06,930 --> 00:45:09,150
What you've got to know about the 
millennial generation and,

1069
00:45:09,410 --> 00:45:10,950
and my friends run as young.
Okay,

1070
00:45:10,960 --> 00:45:12,180
okay.
Must have 13 year olds,

1071
00:45:12,181 --> 00:45:13,014
right?
These people don't know what the 

1072
00:45:14,161 --> 00:45:16,830
Holocaust was,
they don't know.

1073
00:45:17,010 --> 00:45:18,630
They don't have any living relatives who
were,

1074
00:45:18,650 --> 00:45:19,483
who were in it.

1075
00:45:19,560 --> 00:45:22,320
They in many cases don't even really 
remember nine slash 11,

1076
00:45:22,620 --> 00:45:23,453
you know,
they haven't lived through these big 

1077
00:45:25,141 --> 00:45:29,670
traumatic events in world history that 
just trolling and I've recognized that,

1078
00:45:29,671 --> 00:45:30,504
you know,
saying stuff about Jews gets on the 

1079
00:45:31,351 --> 00:45:33,120
nerves of journalists and you can get 
like.

1080
00:45:33,230 --> 00:45:34,940
It's like I've seen that guy on Fox 
News,

1081
00:45:34,941 --> 00:45:37,750
he's on the TV and I just tweeted him 
like this stupid you me,

1082
00:45:37,751 --> 00:45:42,751
but look at it and you know,
it's fun.

1083
00:45:43,500 --> 00:45:44,333
It's funny.
I find it funny because once you 

1084
00:45:46,291 --> 00:45:48,660
recognize it,
it's not really about the Jew thing.

1085
00:45:48,840 --> 00:45:53,550
It's about trolling and provocation and 
that's the thing that they've identified

1086
00:45:53,551 --> 00:45:55,470
works really well.
You begin to,

1087
00:45:55,630 --> 00:45:57,750
you when you look at it as sauce to make
more sense,

1088
00:45:57,751 --> 00:45:58,501
you're like,
yeah,

1089
00:45:58,501 --> 00:45:59,670
of course.
Yeah.

1090
00:46:00,120 --> 00:46:02,540
Racism in this country.
I mean there is no KKK.

1091
00:46:02,550 --> 00:46:03,383
What is it like a few thousand members 
left that we're constantly told what 

1092
00:46:05,431 --> 00:46:06,510
supremacy is a problem.

1093
00:46:06,750 --> 00:46:08,790
There are no white supremacists.
There are no white nationalist.

1094
00:46:08,791 --> 00:46:09,571
They don't in the media,
they don't,

1095
00:46:09,571 --> 00:46:11,040
in politics,
they're nowhere,

1096
00:46:11,250 --> 00:46:11,810
you know,
that,

1097
00:46:11,810 --> 00:46:14,280
that have no purchase whatsoever,
no influence,

1098
00:46:14,281 --> 00:46:15,170
nothing.
If there is,

1099
00:46:15,240 --> 00:46:16,920
if there is a racially supremacist 
movement,

1100
00:46:16,921 --> 00:46:19,770
it's black lives matter and it's very 
well funded and it's massive and it gets

1101
00:46:19,771 --> 00:46:20,604
fawning coverage from the media.
There's no white supremacists movement 

1102
00:46:22,951 --> 00:46:23,784
in this country and what trump 
supporters primarily are reacting to is 

1103
00:46:28,080 --> 00:46:31,860
being lied to and lied about for decades
by the establishment.

1104
00:46:32,220 --> 00:46:34,830
And for me,
trump has a very necessary correction to

1105
00:46:34,831 --> 00:46:35,664
that.
He is part of the Cultural Libertarian 

1106
00:46:37,111 --> 00:46:39,630
movement that you and I,
uh,

1107
00:46:39,631 --> 00:46:42,450
I think both would identify with.
I would say he is the,

1108
00:46:42,451 --> 00:46:43,284
you know,
he is the ultimate icon of that 

1109
00:46:45,061 --> 00:46:45,894
movement.
So basically you think that nobody else 

1110
00:46:47,221 --> 00:46:49,620
could do this.
So I'm with you on a lot of this because

1111
00:46:49,621 --> 00:46:50,454
we do,
we do meet in that cultural libertarian 

1112
00:46:52,351 --> 00:46:54,530
space and I get the language stuff and 
I,

1113
00:46:54,531 --> 00:46:57,540
and I get what you're saying about the 
antisemitism and all,

1114
00:46:57,710 --> 00:46:58,350
all of that stuff.

1115
00:46:58,350 --> 00:46:59,610
I really do.
I understand that.

1116
00:46:59,611 --> 00:47:01,760
And that's why I never attack people I,
you know,

1117
00:47:01,770 --> 00:47:02,603
I try not to fight with these people 
when they're attacking me on twitter or 

1118
00:47:04,590 --> 00:47:05,423
whatever they just want.
They don't care about the subject 

1119
00:47:08,161 --> 00:47:10,170
because that because it's a 10 year old 
kid,

1120
00:47:10,230 --> 00:47:11,063
right?
And the left uses this 17 year old cat 

1121
00:47:12,571 --> 00:47:16,130
is rolling on the evidence that there's 
some uprising of antisemitism,

1122
00:47:16,170 --> 00:47:17,540
of a nuts.
Well,

1123
00:47:17,550 --> 00:47:19,920
the left doesn't do with antisemitism 
because they were okay with that.

1124
00:47:20,260 --> 00:47:21,093
They're fine with that,
but they'll do it with everything else 

1125
00:47:22,200 --> 00:47:23,033
they do.
They certainly do it with anti feminism 

1126
00:47:24,061 --> 00:47:26,460
stuff.
They suggest that there is this epidemic

1127
00:47:26,461 --> 00:47:27,294
of misogyny and they just find a random 
tweet that's find all these tweets from 

1128
00:47:30,521 --> 00:47:30,930
young

1129
00:47:30,930 --> 00:47:31,980
boys,
you know,

1130
00:47:31,981 --> 00:47:32,814
as to the young girls are congratulated 
and applauded and encouraged to be 

1131
00:47:36,151 --> 00:47:38,580
hateful toward men,
right when they,

1132
00:47:38,581 --> 00:47:39,414
you know,
they can get involved in kill all white 

1133
00:47:40,451 --> 00:47:41,281
men,
hashtags,

1134
00:47:41,281 --> 00:47:42,690
masculinity.
So fragile.

1135
00:47:43,140 --> 00:47:43,973
I bathe in male tears.
You see teenage girls doing this stuff 

1136
00:47:46,381 --> 00:47:47,214
and it's hateful and horrible and 
they're going to be alone and miserable 

1137
00:47:48,601 --> 00:47:50,430
forever because feminists have ruined 
them.

1138
00:47:50,700 --> 00:47:51,580
Right?
Um,

1139
00:47:51,780 --> 00:47:53,850
when men do anything remotely similar,
you know,

1140
00:47:53,851 --> 00:47:55,500
they will come in for the most appalling
center.

1141
00:47:55,501 --> 00:47:57,960
They get suspended from school.
This is why girls,

1142
00:47:57,961 --> 00:48:00,050
we under their own names very often,
partly because they,

1143
00:48:00,300 --> 00:48:02,370
many of them are being trained into 
being cry bullies.

1144
00:48:02,380 --> 00:48:03,870
They're being trained into being,
um,

1145
00:48:04,050 --> 00:48:04,330
you know,
to,

1146
00:48:04,330 --> 00:48:06,330
into putting provocations out there and 
then squealing,

1147
00:48:06,350 --> 00:48:07,930
you know,
victimhood had been treated,

1148
00:48:07,980 --> 00:48:08,813
the girls are been taught that victim 
button grievance culture is the way to 

1149
00:48:10,411 --> 00:48:11,580
get what you want.
If you have no talent,

1150
00:48:12,530 --> 00:48:13,710
they're being trained in,
you know,

1151
00:48:13,711 --> 00:48:14,544
into,
um,

1152
00:48:14,550 --> 00:48:16,140
into all of this stuff.
Boys on the other hand,

1153
00:48:16,141 --> 00:48:16,974
very often are anonymous.
They like poll on that and like all of 

1154
00:48:19,700 --> 00:48:21,930
these places where they can go let off 
steam and get,

1155
00:48:21,931 --> 00:48:24,780
get all that boyishness boisterousness 
out of their systems,

1156
00:48:24,781 --> 00:48:26,220
which is a perfectly normal,
healthy friends.

1157
00:48:26,510 --> 00:48:27,343
This is where they would also play video
games and get some of that aggression 

1158
00:48:29,121 --> 00:48:29,500
out

1159
00:48:29,500 --> 00:48:32,950
and not a faggot and whatever.
I mean,

1160
00:48:32,951 --> 00:48:35,530
can you imagine what career I could have
made of,

1161
00:48:35,550 --> 00:48:37,450
you know,
being offended by the word Faggot,

1162
00:48:37,640 --> 00:48:38,550
you know,
I like,

1163
00:48:38,630 --> 00:48:40,480
no,
I wrote a column saying I want Faggot,

1164
00:48:40,510 --> 00:48:41,343
gay and queer to be in common usage.
That's how you take the power away from 

1165
00:48:44,111 --> 00:48:45,730
these words.
If you believe they have power,

1166
00:48:46,150 --> 00:48:47,960
banning them when elevating them up 
into,

1167
00:48:47,961 --> 00:48:48,731
into these,
you know,

1168
00:48:48,731 --> 00:48:49,750
these,
these taboos.

1169
00:48:49,930 --> 00:48:50,820
So I wrote this column,
I said,

1170
00:48:50,821 --> 00:48:53,000
but I want,
I want gay to be restored to its real,

1171
00:48:53,001 --> 00:48:55,090
like twits prestige.
Meaning it doesn't mean you know,

1172
00:48:55,091 --> 00:48:57,430
the real meaning of gays like crap,
rubbish,

1173
00:48:57,431 --> 00:48:58,300
Shit,
lame.

1174
00:48:58,301 --> 00:49:03,301
Hillary supporting immigrant mothers.
You know what I mean?

1175
00:49:03,800 --> 00:49:04,633
It's not in the dictionary yet,
but I'm sure they're getting around to 

1176
00:49:05,621 --> 00:49:06,400
it.
You know,

1177
00:49:06,400 --> 00:49:07,560
this is why,
what gay to me,

1178
00:49:07,620 --> 00:49:08,453
when somebody says something stupid,
I want you to be able to say as gay or 

1179
00:49:11,111 --> 00:49:13,420
stop being a faggot.
It doesn't mean anything.

1180
00:49:13,760 --> 00:49:16,960
These people aren't homophobes.
They do it because it gets to you.

1181
00:49:16,961 --> 00:49:18,520
And if there are any journalists 
watching this,

1182
00:49:18,521 --> 00:49:20,470
please just learn this lesson.

1183
00:49:20,500 --> 00:49:21,333
Well,
it does show you how pervasive the 

1184
00:49:22,661 --> 00:49:25,690
ideology is,
this controlling ideology,

1185
00:49:25,870 --> 00:49:26,703
because I see even now when I'm with 
just some of my gay friends who are 

1186
00:49:30,371 --> 00:49:34,190
supposed to be the most over the top and
not politically correct and all that and

1187
00:49:34,270 --> 00:49:38,090
actually be the politically correct 
system.

1188
00:49:38,450 --> 00:49:39,283
But.
So that's what this goes to what I was 

1189
00:49:40,301 --> 00:49:42,340
saying earlier,
that no way this ideology,

1190
00:49:42,341 --> 00:49:43,174
what it wants is not you because it 
doesn't want you as the individual at 

1191
00:49:45,750 --> 00:49:47,310
once you as the collective and then,

1192
00:49:47,620 --> 00:49:48,453
well,
he wants you as the identity as the 

1193
00:49:51,581 --> 00:49:52,361
identity,
right?

1194
00:49:52,361 --> 00:49:53,194
So you're black or you're gay or you're 
a trainee and he wants to put you in 

1195
00:49:56,261 --> 00:49:57,094
that bucket and tell you what you're 
supposed to believe about things and 

1196
00:49:59,081 --> 00:49:59,914
tell you how to get what you want.
Even if you're not pair to work and you 

1197
00:50:02,591 --> 00:50:03,424
have no skills because you can just 
pretend to be offended about things and 

1198
00:50:06,881 --> 00:50:08,680
you'll get on TV.
Um,

1199
00:50:08,770 --> 00:50:10,270
yeah,
they want you as that they want you as a

1200
00:50:10,271 --> 00:50:11,104
bucket.
And Gay gay men have fallen for this 

1201
00:50:14,050 --> 00:50:15,280
hook,
line and sinker.

1202
00:50:15,660 --> 00:50:19,180
It really fucked up.
But fortunately there is an awakening in

1203
00:50:19,181 --> 00:50:20,014
the gay community,
there was something happening and there 

1204
00:50:20,971 --> 00:50:21,804
was something happening among gay people
and I've noticed it identify antics and 

1205
00:50:24,071 --> 00:50:28,070
I've noticed it in on social media,
there's something with gay,

1206
00:50:28,070 --> 00:50:30,590
so they're beginning to recognize the 
left is not their friend.

1207
00:50:30,830 --> 00:50:33,500
They're beginning to rediscover the 
virtues.

1208
00:50:33,501 --> 00:50:35,090
When we were talking in the last show 
and I said,

1209
00:50:35,091 --> 00:50:35,924
you know,
one of the great things about gay life 

1210
00:50:36,441 --> 00:50:39,680
is you can be,
you can be outrageous and diff different

1211
00:50:39,681 --> 00:50:42,230
and you can to topple out of a club on a
Monday afternoon,

1212
00:50:42,231 --> 00:50:43,064
like dragged off your face and you know,
with the cock and every orifice you can 

1213
00:50:45,291 --> 00:50:46,790
do whatever.
You can do whatever you want.

1214
00:50:46,791 --> 00:50:47,510
And it's,
that's it.

1215
00:50:47,510 --> 00:50:48,343
It's that bit of gay life that creates 
all of the arts and artists and 

1216
00:50:51,591 --> 00:50:52,424
inventors and genius is why we're so 
overrepresented and all the people that 

1217
00:50:54,880 --> 00:50:56,090
shoves society forward,
right?

1218
00:50:56,300 --> 00:50:57,760
That's the kind of gay life that I 
liked.

1219
00:50:57,761 --> 00:50:59,120
That's the kind of gay life that I 
celebrate.

1220
00:50:59,121 --> 00:51:01,810
That's the kind of gay culture I think 
is valuable and gay people.

1221
00:51:01,810 --> 00:51:02,643
So until we discovered this,
because that's as the left is not their 

1222
00:51:04,011 --> 00:51:04,844
friend,
that feminists don't have their 

1223
00:51:06,380 --> 00:51:07,640
interests at heart,
uh,

1224
00:51:07,700 --> 00:51:11,360
that in fact there's an,
they're fundamentally hostile to many of

1225
00:51:11,361 --> 00:51:13,070
the many of the things that make being 
gay.

1226
00:51:13,071 --> 00:51:14,270
Great.
So for the,

1227
00:51:14,300 --> 00:51:15,350
for these guys,
for,

1228
00:51:15,380 --> 00:51:16,850
for gays,
lesbians,

1229
00:51:16,851 --> 00:51:21,160
whatever,
when they see the left defending Islam,

1230
00:51:21,170 --> 00:51:22,430
Islam and they go,
wait a minute,

1231
00:51:22,460 --> 00:51:23,293
I could be that these people want to 
throw us off of roofs and put us on 

1232
00:51:26,271 --> 00:51:28,070
cranes in 11 countries.
It's like,

1233
00:51:28,071 --> 00:51:28,904
what are you doing?
And then for some reason the leftists 

1234
00:51:31,941 --> 00:51:33,830
feel the need to defend this idiot's.
Yeah.

1235
00:51:34,030 --> 00:51:35,400
So let's,
I mean,

1236
00:51:35,840 --> 00:51:37,280
how can you,
how can you support this?

1237
00:51:37,340 --> 00:51:38,400
How can you support this?
I mean,

1238
00:51:38,470 --> 00:51:39,303
you know,
they want what they want is for us to 

1239
00:51:42,020 --> 00:51:45,590
expect us to believe that above gay 
people,

1240
00:51:45,800 --> 00:51:47,900
above women,
above blacks,

1241
00:51:48,020 --> 00:51:49,520
I'm in the blanks,
is the worst thing,

1242
00:51:49,550 --> 00:51:49,940
right?

1243
00:51:49,940 --> 00:51:51,410
I mean,
they actually,

1244
00:51:51,411 --> 00:51:52,244
you know,
there's one group of people in this 

1245
00:51:53,361 --> 00:51:58,361
country who are genuine grievances who 
to whom something is still owed.

1246
00:51:59,720 --> 00:52:00,980
And that's the black community,
right?

1247
00:52:01,220 --> 00:52:02,053
There is a legacy from slavery.
I don't happen to believe that black 

1248
00:52:03,411 --> 00:52:04,244
lives matter is the honest because I 
think it's hateful and divisive and the 

1249
00:52:05,631 --> 00:52:08,570
only real result of black lives matter 
is black cities in flames.

1250
00:52:08,750 --> 00:52:10,370
Wait,
let's not gloss over that because people

1251
00:52:10,371 --> 00:52:12,890
are gonna are gonna.
Try to go after what you just said.

1252
00:52:13,070 --> 00:52:13,903
You're saying that the,
that the black community does have 

1253
00:52:14,961 --> 00:52:15,794
legitimate grievances of course were 
brought here by and large as slaves of 

1254
00:52:18,050 --> 00:52:18,883
course.
And then did anybody ever suggest 

1255
00:52:21,201 --> 00:52:22,940
otherwise?
I think a lot of people would say,

1256
00:52:23,080 --> 00:52:24,710
Oh,
if you're against black lives matter,

1257
00:52:24,711 --> 00:52:25,544
you're against.
Nobody's done more for the black 

1258
00:52:26,061 --> 00:52:28,280
community than me.
I'm normally on went back.

1259
00:52:28,280 --> 00:52:29,260
But um,
the,

1260
00:52:29,270 --> 00:52:31,490
the issue is that the issue is very 
straightforward.

1261
00:52:31,960 --> 00:52:33,020
You know,
black lives matter is,

1262
00:52:33,021 --> 00:52:34,850
hate is a hate for supremacy 
organization.

1263
00:52:34,970 --> 00:52:38,020
I'm in so far as it's organized at all 
it is,

1264
00:52:38,240 --> 00:52:41,690
is it's a movement of black supremacy 
and it's a bad thing.

1265
00:52:42,020 --> 00:52:43,950
But this is what the law,
you know,

1266
00:52:43,990 --> 00:52:45,620
this is what the left likes to do is to 
find people.

1267
00:52:45,980 --> 00:52:49,190
I forgot what we were talking about 
bringing this all back to trump.

1268
00:52:49,490 --> 00:52:50,323
So what.
I haven't heard you say is anything 

1269
00:52:52,311 --> 00:52:55,400
related to policy,
but before I even let you answer that,

1270
00:52:55,401 --> 00:52:58,610
I think what you're just saying is it's 
completely irrelevant.

1271
00:52:58,880 --> 00:52:59,713
That's what you're saying,
that this movement has nothing to not 

1272
00:53:02,230 --> 00:53:03,063
political movement in that direction.
There's nobody to take trump's place 

1273
00:53:05,751 --> 00:53:06,261
after.
Right?

1274
00:53:06,261 --> 00:53:09,500
If trump became president via via all of
this stuff,

1275
00:53:09,530 --> 00:53:11,830
all of this cultural stuff,
he's a great president.

1276
00:53:12,260 --> 00:53:13,200
He's B.
He's creating.

1277
00:53:13,340 --> 00:53:14,270
It's you.
It's you.

1278
00:53:14,271 --> 00:53:18,110
Your vp was creating a culture.
I want to honor you for a second.

1279
00:53:18,140 --> 00:53:19,820
You would be a good price.
Would be a fantastic.

1280
00:53:20,140 --> 00:53:20,973
Can you imagine?
I bet you feel like answering a 

1281
00:53:22,541 --> 00:53:24,560
questions today.
I'm going shopping.

1282
00:53:24,590 --> 00:53:26,480
Put your comments in the box.
See you later,

1283
00:53:27,190 --> 00:53:29,370
but what you're talking about is a 
cultural revolution,

1284
00:53:29,371 --> 00:53:30,204
not a political revolution,
so that's interesting because Bernie 

1285
00:53:32,220 --> 00:53:33,053
who's talking a lot about flip the 
system and our system's corrupt and 

1286
00:53:35,581 --> 00:53:36,780
money and politics,
the same thing.

1287
00:53:36,840 --> 00:53:40,560
He's talking about a political 
revolution and basically you're saying,

1288
00:53:40,561 --> 00:53:41,291
forget that.
Yeah.

1289
00:53:41,291 --> 00:53:44,100
That's just because he's an idiot and 
he's 20 years out of date.

1290
00:53:44,310 --> 00:53:47,540
That would have worked before when 
people were upset about economics,

1291
00:53:47,570 --> 00:53:50,130
upset about foreign policy and politics 
and you want to work 10 years ago,

1292
00:53:50,131 --> 00:53:52,860
the Iraq war.
Now this war is cultural.

1293
00:53:53,310 --> 00:53:54,143
There's a cultural war and as any one 
candidate for president fighting this 

1294
00:53:56,551 --> 00:53:57,384
war culturally and it's trump,
he doesn't care too much whether he is 

1295
00:54:00,211 --> 00:54:01,044
occasionally inconsistent on policy 
because he understands that nobody else 

1296
00:54:03,211 --> 00:54:04,044
does either.

1297
00:54:04,200 --> 00:54:06,600
And he's very sad.
That's a sad thing.

1298
00:54:07,110 --> 00:54:08,900
Sad,
sad about.

1299
00:54:08,940 --> 00:54:09,770
No,
no.

1300
00:54:09,770 --> 00:54:13,070
I studied politics set over here.
Why don't you study politics,

1301
00:54:13,550 --> 00:54:14,383
you know,
goals once he's made two very clear 

1302
00:54:18,720 --> 00:54:22,200
statements.
One is that he wants to build a wall and

1303
00:54:22,201 --> 00:54:23,034
that's emblematic of what he believes 
about immigration and illegal 

1304
00:54:26,491 --> 00:54:28,500
immigration in particular.
They can come over as he says,

1305
00:54:28,501 --> 00:54:30,730
but they've got to come over legally.
Um,

1306
00:54:31,670 --> 00:54:35,490
which in and of itself isn't racist,
right wing racist about that.

1307
00:54:35,520 --> 00:54:36,353
Well,
people keep Mexicans out of the race 

1308
00:54:37,831 --> 00:54:38,550
that way.
On that.

1309
00:54:38,550 --> 00:54:39,490
Yeah.
Well,

1310
00:54:39,700 --> 00:54:40,533
his Hispanic,
because you Americans have this or 

1311
00:54:41,590 --> 00:54:44,680
Hispanic,
what you try to,

1312
00:54:44,690 --> 00:54:45,523
you try to invent like divisions between
people so that anything anyone says 

1313
00:54:48,271 --> 00:54:50,310
about anyone can somehow be called 
racist,

1314
00:54:50,720 --> 00:54:52,980
Hispanics away on that.
That I'll bring the chart next time.

1315
00:54:53,710 --> 00:54:55,670
I don't want to get bogged down.
This is a new thing or the thing,

1316
00:54:55,730 --> 00:54:56,370
you know,
you people,

1317
00:54:56,370 --> 00:54:57,750
you people make these rules up.

1318
00:54:57,840 --> 00:55:00,000
We just have to live in it and live it.
They live in your world.

1319
00:55:01,360 --> 00:55:02,890
Now,
of course it's not racist if,

1320
00:55:03,070 --> 00:55:05,200
what he's,
what he's saying is that there is um,

1321
00:55:05,270 --> 00:55:06,103
you know,
and in fact of course is his concerns 

1322
00:55:08,520 --> 00:55:12,240
about immigration benefit the black 
community more than anybody else because

1323
00:55:12,241 --> 00:55:15,240
when you Hispanic immigrants come in,
it's black wages.

1324
00:55:15,241 --> 00:55:16,074
They depressed not,
not,

1325
00:55:16,200 --> 00:55:18,300
not primarily necessarily white wages.
By the way,

1326
00:55:18,301 --> 00:55:21,090
Barack Obama said something to that 
effect when he was running for president

1327
00:55:21,091 --> 00:55:21,940
the first time.
Yes.

1328
00:55:21,980 --> 00:55:23,400
He's done so much for the black 
community.

1329
00:55:23,790 --> 00:55:24,660
I mean,
racial,

1330
00:55:24,780 --> 00:55:28,320
racial harmony in America now.
Such a lovely thing.

1331
00:55:28,350 --> 00:55:30,210
Eight years of Obama.
Don't we all just love each other?

1332
00:55:30,211 --> 00:55:31,044
After eight years of Obama now he's been
the has been the most disastrous 

1333
00:55:33,481 --> 00:55:35,220
president for blacks in.
Is that.

1334
00:55:35,221 --> 00:55:36,054
Is that Obama's biggest failure then 
that he came in with the political and 

1335
00:55:39,301 --> 00:55:40,800
cultural revolution,
right?

1336
00:55:40,800 --> 00:55:44,400
It was political and it was cultural.
It had both elements to it,

1337
00:55:44,670 --> 00:55:46,950
but what he's going to exit with 
regardless,

1338
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:47,833
everything comes,
everything is worse and everything is 

1339
00:55:49,741 --> 00:55:52,080
worse as a result of him will the 
economy.

1340
00:55:52,420 --> 00:55:54,960
Right?
The American economy is better right now

1341
00:55:54,961 --> 00:55:56,400
than it was.
Well,

1342
00:55:56,401 --> 00:55:58,980
okay,
but give me silica.

1343
00:55:59,310 --> 00:56:01,570
Gays can get married.
I know you're not a big proponent.

1344
00:56:01,610 --> 00:56:03,660
I wish they would stop.
I know,

1345
00:56:03,661 --> 00:56:05,830
but I wish they would name a bit 
quality.

1346
00:56:05,850 --> 00:56:06,683
Getting married.
We're going to ask your group and they 

1347
00:56:08,281 --> 00:56:10,130
don't work as hard because they will.
Interesting.

1348
00:56:10,131 --> 00:56:13,110
Oh No.
All of that come of our Michael Cook for

1349
00:56:13,180 --> 00:56:16,040
you.
I thought sake,

1350
00:56:16,080 --> 00:56:18,840
but I know you're furry quality so I 
know you're okay with ish.

1351
00:56:18,910 --> 00:56:20,610
Ish.
Ish.

1352
00:56:20,670 --> 00:56:24,280
So is that really his failure that at 
when he leaves this thing,

1353
00:56:24,281 --> 00:56:26,950
after eight years,
what could be ushered in after,

1354
00:56:26,951 --> 00:56:27,784
and not that it's purely his fault,
but what can be ushered in after is 

1355
00:56:30,491 --> 00:56:32,290
going to be a complete flip of the 
system.

1356
00:56:32,510 --> 00:56:34,800
I,
I don't know if that sounds good.

1357
00:56:35,180 --> 00:56:36,760
That sounds good to you.
So it's not a failure.

1358
00:56:36,830 --> 00:56:37,281
Well,
no,

1359
00:56:37,281 --> 00:56:38,114
I mean I,
I live in exciting times when pretty 

1360
00:56:40,731 --> 00:56:43,040
much everyone in the country wants 
establishment to suffer.

1361
00:56:43,250 --> 00:56:45,050
Pretty much everyone in the country 
hates journalists,

1362
00:56:45,080 --> 00:56:46,490
hates politicians,
hates the,

1363
00:56:46,491 --> 00:56:47,324
you know,
the more they find out about what their 

1364
00:56:47,871 --> 00:56:50,210
kids are being taught at college.
Largely thanks to me,

1365
00:56:50,211 --> 00:56:51,980
I think,
but hate that too.

1366
00:56:52,370 --> 00:56:55,880
And we live in exciting times.
People want to tear this system apart.

1367
00:56:55,881 --> 00:56:57,380
They want to rebuild the system in a 
different way.

1368
00:56:57,381 --> 00:56:58,214
I've suggested that.
I'd quite like to do it along 

1369
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:00,833
authoritarian libertarian lines because 
I think it makes more sense the way 

1370
00:57:02,961 --> 00:57:05,270
people communicate these days and 
people's priorities.

1371
00:57:05,271 --> 00:57:06,860
I think people are more interested in 
culture than,

1372
00:57:06,890 --> 00:57:09,260
than economics selection.
Um,

1373
00:57:09,380 --> 00:57:11,780
that's the sort of realignment I want to
May look very different.

1374
00:57:12,140 --> 00:57:13,140
Um,
I,

1375
00:57:14,210 --> 00:57:15,043
what I like about daddy like about trump
is that he is introducing an element of 

1376
00:57:20,421 --> 00:57:25,421
realness and an element of fun and 
mischief into an arena in which into,

1377
00:57:25,520 --> 00:57:26,353
into public life,
which is an arena in which there has 

1378
00:57:28,281 --> 00:57:33,281
been so little freedom and joy for so 
long that is unnecessary correction,

1379
00:57:35,020 --> 00:57:37,880
you know,
so that can't make jokes on TV anymore.

1380
00:57:37,880 --> 00:57:40,580
Life isn't fun anymore.
As a journalist,

1381
00:57:40,581 --> 00:57:42,530
like if I were a regular journalists,
try and have a,

1382
00:57:42,540 --> 00:57:44,750
not a regular journalist because I work 
at a wonderful place.

1383
00:57:44,751 --> 00:57:46,130
Breitbart with lets me do,
you know,

1384
00:57:46,550 --> 00:57:50,420
outrageous and crazy things.
And obviously now I'm becoming this sort

1385
00:57:50,421 --> 00:57:52,410
of media figure I can.
I've got more licensed to,

1386
00:57:52,450 --> 00:57:53,283
to,
to do stone.

1387
00:57:53,370 --> 00:57:56,070
So if I'm a regular journalist Ip,
so,

1388
00:57:56,071 --> 00:57:56,341
and,
and,

1389
00:57:56,341 --> 00:57:57,310
and I mean,
I know,

1390
00:57:57,320 --> 00:57:58,070
do you know,
dozens,

1391
00:57:58,070 --> 00:57:59,840
the minor.
It doesn't say it's a miserable life.

1392
00:57:59,860 --> 00:58:00,693
They can't say you can't tell the truth,
you can't tell facts because somebody 

1393
00:58:04,071 --> 00:58:05,120
somewhere will get upset.
You know,

1394
00:58:05,121 --> 00:58:05,954
you can't say facts was,
journalism has become now more about 

1395
00:58:08,541 --> 00:58:09,374
virtue signaling to your fellow 
reporters than telling the truth about 

1396
00:58:13,521 --> 00:58:14,110
what's actually happening.

1397
00:58:14,110 --> 00:58:14,943
Right?
So I got into a big fight with a 

1398
00:58:15,521 --> 00:58:16,354
buzzfeed guy this week because they 
wrote a piece about the regressive left 

1399
00:58:18,830 --> 00:58:22,370
claim,
sweet claim you fall with this guy had a

1400
00:58:22,390 --> 00:58:23,223
soft spot for Joe Bernstein,
but I don't even want to give him any 

1401
00:58:25,031 --> 00:58:25,900
extra cred,
right?

1402
00:58:25,901 --> 00:58:27,390
Let's not.
We don't have to waste any set.

1403
00:58:27,400 --> 00:58:30,750
And even name him the left as you say,
this is what the lab.

1404
00:58:30,751 --> 00:58:33,730
So I left the voldemort left us.
So you want an.

1405
00:58:34,410 --> 00:58:36,180
Somebody is wrong.
Talk about it.

1406
00:58:36,210 --> 00:58:39,490
Will shine the light on guy your,
your progressive,

1407
00:58:39,491 --> 00:58:41,830
your natural progressive tendencies just
slipped out.

1408
00:58:41,860 --> 00:58:43,210
Alright.
So this guy,

1409
00:58:43,270 --> 00:58:44,103
you want to put him under the credit.
Why you sent this Guy Bernstein from 

1410
00:58:47,951 --> 00:58:49,450
buzzfeed.
Joe Bernstein.

1411
00:58:49,480 --> 00:58:52,120
There you go.
I want the.

1412
00:58:52,121 --> 00:58:52,954
I want the full light of scrutiny on 
every one I disagree with so that other 

1413
00:58:56,351 --> 00:58:57,184
people can see their wrong too.
So this guy basically wrote a piece on 

1414
00:59:00,860 --> 00:59:02,330
Joel.
Joel.

1415
00:59:02,660 --> 00:59:06,790
Joel Bernstein wrote a piece on buzzfeed
this week.

1416
00:59:07,090 --> 00:59:07,923
You don't,
you want to call me a cultural 

1417
00:59:08,850 --> 00:59:09,683
librarians.

1418
00:59:11,910 --> 00:59:12,743
I'm just not that because I'm a cultural
libertarianism and because he's never 

1419
00:59:16,841 --> 00:59:17,674
got the balls to say.
What do you really mean that about both 

1420
00:59:20,580 --> 00:59:22,280
your librarian.
I thought it was great,

1421
00:59:22,330 --> 00:59:22,641
right?
Yeah.

1422
00:59:22,641 --> 00:59:25,580
Well you just went straight back to the 
fucking reference section.

1423
00:59:26,240 --> 00:59:27,073
So Joe Burns OPA and stained from busboy
and gives feedback on basically saying 

1424
00:59:31,371 --> 00:59:32,340
that,
uh,

1425
00:59:32,510 --> 00:59:34,280
you know,
my guy as in Sam,

1426
00:59:34,281 --> 00:59:35,590
Harrison,
a few others will mark,

1427
00:59:35,640 --> 00:59:37,190
you know,
created this regressive lessons.

1428
00:59:37,191 --> 00:59:39,560
But really what the regressive left 
thing is about.

1429
00:59:39,740 --> 00:59:41,420
It's about alt right.
Hate.

1430
00:59:41,421 --> 00:59:42,254
And those are the people that have made 
it a thing where I know and every 

1431
00:59:45,080 --> 00:59:45,913
instance of it on twitter and everywhere
else is because of the few people that 

1432
00:59:49,341 --> 00:59:50,174
are left on the left,
like myself who has tried to make it 

1433
00:59:52,071 --> 00:59:53,160
into something.
Now again,

1434
00:59:53,180 --> 00:59:56,580
that sounds like insider baseball stuff,
but it's about that.

1435
00:59:56,730 --> 00:59:59,900
But he wrote a piece about me that was 
wrong to what I did notice.

1436
00:59:59,930 --> 01:00:01,490
You have like,
you know,

1437
01:00:01,520 --> 01:00:02,690
Oh,
don't mention his name.

1438
01:00:02,900 --> 01:00:03,920
Well,
I did instead was,

1439
01:00:03,921 --> 01:00:06,260
I challenged them to debate me.
I said to bait me,

1440
01:00:06,350 --> 01:00:08,330
I'll give you $5,000.
Rock up one hour,

1441
01:00:08,360 --> 01:00:09,470
debate me.
You're wrong.

1442
01:00:09,560 --> 01:00:10,310
Prove,
prove,

1443
01:00:10,310 --> 01:00:13,760
prove your case.
Scurried into a whole silence,

1444
01:00:13,810 --> 01:00:16,610
carried into a hole.
They actually went up to $6.

1445
01:00:16,820 --> 01:00:19,340
Now,
to be fair to Joe Bernstein of Buzzfeed,

1446
01:00:19,940 --> 01:00:22,940
buzzfeed takes at Bernstein on twitter.
Go.

1447
01:00:23,190 --> 01:00:24,023
Okay.

1448
01:00:25,880 --> 01:00:27,740
To be fair to him,
since then we've,

1449
01:00:27,800 --> 01:00:29,470
we've worked together and,
and you know,

1450
01:00:29,471 --> 01:00:31,190
when pcs he's broken some news for me 
and,

1451
01:00:31,430 --> 01:00:32,263
and he's been,
um,

1452
01:00:32,300 --> 01:00:34,660
he's been very fair and very reasonable.
Um,

1453
01:00:34,700 --> 01:00:35,533
but he was wrong about that and refused 
to debate because he knew he couldn't 

1454
01:00:37,780 --> 01:00:39,300
defend his arguments.
Uh,

1455
01:00:39,320 --> 01:00:41,420
the same thing I think applies with you 
too.

1456
01:00:42,300 --> 01:00:45,080
I don't think he'd be able to defend his
position on that piece,

1457
01:00:45,081 --> 01:00:46,400
which was obviously garbage.
Well,

1458
01:00:46,401 --> 01:00:49,640
I took it out and they all got hundreds 
and thousands of responses to him and he

1459
01:00:49,641 --> 01:00:50,690
ignored all of it.
Of course.

1460
01:00:51,670 --> 01:00:53,170
I don't think he'd show up to debate you
on that,

1461
01:00:53,180 --> 01:00:54,470
but you should,
if you lend me the fact that,

1462
01:00:54,471 --> 01:00:55,970
well I won't need it because I'd win the
debate.

1463
01:00:55,971 --> 01:00:58,440
So that's.
No,

1464
01:00:58,550 --> 01:01:02,210
you can't have any money but it goes to 
the Shapiro now.

1465
01:01:02,211 --> 01:01:04,970
Why do we still have money with guests 
on your show?

1466
01:01:04,970 --> 01:01:05,990
The ostium,
how much he was worth,

1467
01:01:05,991 --> 01:01:06,980
how much you earned or something like 
that.

1468
01:01:07,010 --> 01:01:08,330
Well,
I wanted him as a,

1469
01:01:08,331 --> 01:01:10,190
uh,
as a one percenter to,

1470
01:01:10,240 --> 01:01:12,820
to tell people how much you want a 
number I wanted.

1471
01:01:12,840 --> 01:01:14,030
I said I give you a number.
I'd have.

1472
01:01:14,070 --> 01:01:14,903
No he didn't,
but he said he's in the over 400 K I 

1473
01:01:17,121 --> 01:01:19,710
guess situation.
Who isn't?

1474
01:01:21,560 --> 01:01:24,950
Go ahead.
We're really foster right to Laurie.

1475
01:01:25,640 --> 01:01:28,150
Eric and I'll make a note of that.
Alright.

1476
01:01:28,250 --> 01:01:29,410
So all of this stuff,
so,

1477
01:01:29,480 --> 01:01:30,313
so trump,
you're laying out a decent case of 

1478
01:01:32,571 --> 01:01:33,404
putting all this stuff together.
But let's talk quickly about the 

1479
01:01:36,320 --> 01:01:37,153
pushback from the establishment because 
I think that's an under reported piece 

1480
01:01:40,971 --> 01:01:44,810
about this that the establishment has 
tried very hard to push back on this and

1481
01:01:44,811 --> 01:01:45,644
they are rolling out.
Mitt Romney lost guy who lost last time 

1482
01:01:48,191 --> 01:01:49,170
is supposed to be the same,
right?

1483
01:01:49,630 --> 01:01:51,890
You roll out,
you know Lindsey Graham goes from failed

1484
01:01:51,891 --> 01:01:53,480
candidate.
He endorses another failed candidate,

1485
01:01:53,481 --> 01:01:54,314
but another like they just roll out the 
same guys and then if you watch the 

1486
01:01:56,301 --> 01:01:57,134
debates,
and I've watched 90 percent of them 

1487
01:01:58,850 --> 01:02:01,550
trump systematically,
whether you agree with him or not,

1488
01:02:01,820 --> 01:02:02,653
systematically destroys these people.
I mean he embarrassed your voice 

1489
01:02:06,100 --> 01:02:08,900
actually is worsening system 
systematically destroys these people.

1490
01:02:08,901 --> 01:02:09,734
I mean here he seems to have no 
particularly a consistent approach to 

1491
01:02:12,531 --> 01:02:13,850
destroy.
Let me just rocks up.

1492
01:02:13,851 --> 01:02:16,370
Cracks a few jokes and tell slip.
Tell tells it how it is.

1493
01:02:16,520 --> 01:02:20,010
It's actually unsystematic,
which is even more of an indictment on

1494
01:02:20,010 --> 01:02:21,620
the establishment.
How delmia,

1495
01:02:21,690 --> 01:02:22,523
how stupid they are.
They think we're also the only thing 

1496
01:02:23,820 --> 01:02:25,530
where it is.
It is.

1497
01:02:25,560 --> 01:02:26,393
So do you think if they had put the 
establishment had found someone that 

1498
01:02:28,951 --> 01:02:32,970
basically knew who he was,
had decent conservative principles.

1499
01:02:33,090 --> 01:02:33,923
So it's not.
I guess the closest to that could have 

1500
01:02:35,911 --> 01:02:36,744
possibly been jeb,
but the bush name was so damaged and he 

1501
01:02:40,321 --> 01:02:43,200
was also a terrible candidate.
He's a classic cook.

1502
01:02:43,260 --> 01:02:44,480
Yeah.
He's saying he's,

1503
01:02:44,540 --> 01:02:46,860
as we say on the Internet.
So coq one have you defined cock because

1504
01:02:46,861 --> 01:02:48,150
I see this popping up all that.
Well,

1505
01:02:48,180 --> 01:02:49,013
so I like this word and all the rest of 
the conservative media don't because 

1506
01:02:51,541 --> 01:02:52,980
they know it describes them.
Um,

1507
01:02:53,340 --> 01:02:54,410
and it is.
Well.

1508
01:02:54,450 --> 01:02:55,283
So I know that you probably don't watch 
any pornography anymore because since 

1509
01:02:57,691 --> 01:03:00,780
you've been with your partner for 
ceremonial life,

1510
01:03:02,490 --> 01:03:03,360
more like a lesbian.

1511
01:03:03,360 --> 01:03:03,941
Go ahead.
Just,

1512
01:03:03,941 --> 01:03:07,440
just sexless knew about carpet.
Well,

1513
01:03:07,441 --> 01:03:08,880
I'm about to socal about phone.
That's what.

1514
01:03:08,920 --> 01:03:09,753
Okay.
So if you were a porn viewers are not 

1515
01:03:11,851 --> 01:03:12,810
particularly important for you.
Yeah,

1516
01:03:12,840 --> 01:03:14,480
if you were a point of view,
um,

1517
01:03:14,850 --> 01:03:18,960
he didn't want that to be a shorter.
Doubled down on that one.

1518
01:03:19,800 --> 01:03:20,633
If you were a porn viewer,
you may be familiar with genre of porn 

1519
01:03:24,181 --> 01:03:29,181
in which sort of white husband watches 
his wife get rammed by a large black man

1520
01:03:30,810 --> 01:03:32,460
that's not always a large black man at 
sometimes at this,

1521
01:03:32,470 --> 01:03:33,303
whatever this is,
this cockiness is cuckold tree from 

1522
01:03:35,790 --> 01:03:40,590
Shakespeare and chaucer to where.
And it wasn't anything to do with race.

1523
01:03:41,240 --> 01:03:43,260
I don't think it's specifically to,
the rest is just sort of become a bit of

1524
01:03:43,261 --> 01:03:44,190
a ponder them as well,
but anyway,

1525
01:03:44,670 --> 01:03:45,503
the idea is it's sort of,
it's people who have sold out and 

1526
01:03:47,191 --> 01:03:49,200
enjoying watching their wife,
their country.

1527
01:03:49,200 --> 01:03:51,720
They're people that are supposed to look
after whether its readers in the case of

1528
01:03:51,721 --> 01:03:52,800
journalist stories,
uh,

1529
01:03:52,870 --> 01:03:53,703
constituents,
the case of politicians getting fucked 

1530
01:03:55,141 --> 01:03:56,180
by,
um,

1531
01:03:56,450 --> 01:03:58,380
uh,
some scarier external force,

1532
01:03:58,381 --> 01:04:01,350
whether it's radical Islam or mass 
immigration or whatever.

1533
01:04:01,351 --> 01:04:03,300
Now it's metaphoric,
it's a metaphor,

1534
01:04:03,301 --> 01:04:04,330
you know,
um,

1535
01:04:04,340 --> 01:04:05,970
and it's a perfectly good,
uh,

1536
01:04:05,980 --> 01:04:08,670
and perfectly fun,
vibrant sort of metaphor.

1537
01:04:08,671 --> 01:04:11,280
I quite like it and I use it myself.
I think it's fun and it's,

1538
01:04:11,310 --> 01:04:12,430
it's very,
uh,

1539
01:04:12,520 --> 01:04:14,040
it's very,
of course,

1540
01:04:14,041 --> 01:04:16,260
conservatives now,
the conservative establishment,

1541
01:04:16,290 --> 01:04:17,123
which is basically gotten along with all
of the tenants of the left and now look 

1542
01:04:20,440 --> 01:04:22,410
to the left for approval.
Is it okay?

1543
01:04:22,411 --> 01:04:25,800
Can I say this as this racist,
sexist than the right,

1544
01:04:25,830 --> 01:04:27,100
the right way.
Establishment.

1545
01:04:27,120 --> 01:04:27,953
So terrified of being seen as racist,
that they sort of distanced themselves 

1546
01:04:31,951 --> 01:04:34,410
from this word in case or any sort of 
racial connotations whatsoever.

1547
01:04:34,410 --> 01:04:34,831
No,
no,

1548
01:04:34,831 --> 01:04:36,210
we can't go to jail.
Anyway,

1549
01:04:37,320 --> 01:04:39,360
Jeb has a bit of a perfect example of 
this.

1550
01:04:39,361 --> 01:04:41,610
You know,
somebody who is weak,

1551
01:04:42,030 --> 01:04:43,660
uh,
who is it?

1552
01:04:43,670 --> 01:04:46,770
There's no sense with with Jeb Bush,
there was never any sense,

1553
01:04:46,771 --> 01:04:47,604
and I feel that,
sorry he's gone now because it was kind 

1554
01:04:48,480 --> 01:04:51,540
of Nice Guy,
but there's no sense he would ever stick

1555
01:04:51,541 --> 01:04:52,374
up for his country.
And the one thing you can't say about 

1556
01:04:54,451 --> 01:04:56,520
trump is that he wouldn't stick up for 
America.

1557
01:04:56,521 --> 01:04:57,354
Now,
you may disagree with some of his 

1558
01:04:57,661 --> 01:05:00,150
prescriptions,
but he clearly loves the country.

1559
01:05:00,300 --> 01:05:02,970
He clearly wants America to be great 
again.

1560
01:05:02,971 --> 01:05:06,360
Now that's a very provocative slogan.
Make America great again.

1561
01:05:06,570 --> 01:05:07,470
You know the,
again,

1562
01:05:07,540 --> 01:05:10,630
has that something was lost,
right?

1563
01:05:10,650 --> 01:05:11,730
As a,
there's a,

1564
01:05:11,800 --> 01:05:14,930
there's a big,
there's a big shocking claim in there,

1565
01:05:14,931 --> 01:05:17,260
one that politicians don't normally 
make,

1566
01:05:17,890 --> 01:05:19,240
that the country is not great.

1567
01:05:19,240 --> 01:05:19,751
It's a,
in fact,

1568
01:05:19,751 --> 01:05:22,330
is this sort of thing you normally hear 
from liberals if we're honest,

1569
01:05:22,331 --> 01:05:23,164
you know,
Obama clearly doesn't like this country 

1570
01:05:23,711 --> 01:05:24,610
very much.
Um,

1571
01:05:24,650 --> 01:05:25,483
we generally hear it from conservatives.
Now there's something very exciting 

1572
01:05:29,381 --> 01:05:30,500
going on with that.
All right,

1573
01:05:30,520 --> 01:05:32,640
with this candidate is something very 
exciting,

1574
01:05:32,660 --> 01:05:34,990
all that terrifies establishment,
but what I've,

1575
01:05:35,560 --> 01:05:36,393
what I've realized,
which I think is really interesting is 

1576
01:05:39,071 --> 01:05:43,360
that the trump has illustrated that the 
concerns of the elites,

1577
01:05:43,390 --> 01:05:44,223
the concerns of the establishment,
the concerns of journalists and 

1578
01:05:45,851 --> 01:05:46,684
politicians and the people who run our 
lives are so alien from ordinary people 

1579
01:05:50,411 --> 01:05:51,244
care about that they can't even argue 
against him and it resonate with the 

1580
01:05:54,191 --> 01:05:54,940
public.
I mean,

1581
01:05:54,940 --> 01:05:57,430
let's take for example something that 
you and I both care about.

1582
01:05:57,550 --> 01:05:59,890
The First Amendment free speech,
freedom of the press.

1583
01:06:00,160 --> 01:06:02,740
Trump has repeatedly suggested that he 
would like to,

1584
01:06:02,741 --> 01:06:05,920
in some way control,
curtail the full freedoms of the press.

1585
01:06:05,920 --> 01:06:08,970
He would like just this week with the 
Washington Post that he would like.

1586
01:06:09,010 --> 01:06:11,420
He would like to make it more.
I mean,

1587
01:06:11,430 --> 01:06:13,660
I think what he's saying is he wants to 
strengthen defamation law,

1588
01:06:13,840 --> 01:06:16,240
right?
Bad News,

1589
01:06:16,241 --> 01:06:18,290
particularly for you even more than me.
Right?

1590
01:06:18,400 --> 01:06:22,120
Well,
is it because I don't lie about people.

1591
01:06:22,480 --> 01:06:25,720
I might say funny names.
Sometimes I might ridicule people,

1592
01:06:25,721 --> 01:06:28,560
but I don't lie about them.
Like the liberal press does every day.

1593
01:06:28,710 --> 01:06:29,543
Uh,
and the conservative press is just as 

1594
01:06:30,071 --> 01:06:30,521
bad,
frankly.

1595
01:06:30,521 --> 01:06:32,710
They're all terrible.
I don't label people,

1596
01:06:32,770 --> 01:06:36,100
I don't make up facts about people.
Why would I worry about that?

1597
01:06:36,280 --> 01:06:36,971
I mean,
let's.

1598
01:06:36,971 --> 01:06:38,500
And let's look at it from an electrical 
point of view,

1599
01:06:38,501 --> 01:06:39,670
right?
The public,

1600
01:06:39,671 --> 01:06:40,504
my head just went through the list of 
all my liberal friends that lie 

1601
01:06:42,341 --> 01:06:43,510
constantly,
publicly.

1602
01:06:43,520 --> 01:06:45,920
And that would suffer from this.
Right?

1603
01:06:46,120 --> 01:06:47,410
Exactly.
But I wouldn't know.

1604
01:06:47,650 --> 01:06:49,420
I've never,
I've never,

1605
01:06:49,450 --> 01:06:50,283
I mean,
I say the most appalling things about 

1606
01:06:51,431 --> 01:06:52,600
people,
but they're true.

1607
01:06:52,760 --> 01:06:54,610
Um,
and I've never been sued.

1608
01:06:54,640 --> 01:06:56,320
I might have an opposite.
So I've never been sued.

1609
01:06:56,321 --> 01:06:57,154
I mean,
you had imagined I'd be in court every 

1610
01:06:57,910 --> 01:06:58,211
week,
you know?

1611
01:06:58,211 --> 01:06:59,044
No,
I don't get sued because there's a 

1612
01:06:59,711 --> 01:07:03,130
difference between satire and joking.
But my fat,

1613
01:07:03,140 --> 01:07:04,560
I get my facts right.
Yeah.

1614
01:07:04,770 --> 01:07:07,300
I know there are,
there are people that are in court every

1615
01:07:07,300 --> 01:07:08,350
week and it's Gorka,
you know,

1616
01:07:08,351 --> 01:07:11,230
because they are so completely 
unethical.

1617
01:07:11,231 --> 01:07:12,064
I mean,
so that's why the right felt that the 

1618
01:07:13,181 --> 01:07:15,250
gawker thing with Hogan.
I know we're jumping all over the place.

1619
01:07:15,251 --> 01:07:18,530
That's why we enjoyed that.
Really loved.

1620
01:07:18,620 --> 01:07:22,270
But I saw it as a huge victory to 
because we have places like awkward that

1621
01:07:22,271 --> 01:07:25,270
are just better literally trying to 
destroy lives.

1622
01:07:25,840 --> 01:07:29,760
It's enough,
it's our private citizens anyway.

1623
01:07:29,850 --> 01:07:30,683
So I mean,
look,

1624
01:07:30,970 --> 01:07:32,680
the approach that we'll probably get 
overturned on appeal,

1625
01:07:32,980 --> 01:07:33,813
and it's probably better that we don't 
have an anti free speech precedent of 

1626
01:07:35,471 --> 01:07:36,304
quite that nature because who knows what
kinds of sex tapes might be in the 

1627
01:07:38,201 --> 01:07:39,520
public interest in,
in future.

1628
01:07:39,730 --> 01:07:41,170
Um,
two things is,

1629
01:07:41,171 --> 01:07:42,460
you know,
Pinellas County,

1630
01:07:42,461 --> 01:07:47,380
Florida juries don't set legal precedent
and it's going to get overturned.

1631
01:07:47,760 --> 01:07:48,690
So it'll be a pdf.
Anyway,

1632
01:07:48,700 --> 01:07:53,700
we'll see on the trump thing when he 
says that the press are the bad guys.

1633
01:07:55,900 --> 01:07:56,733
Most people agree with him and this is 
what the press doesn't understand 

1634
01:07:59,050 --> 01:07:59,883
because they genuinely believe that they
are like some sort of true warriors for 

1635
01:08:03,191 --> 01:08:04,450
Truth and justice.
They're not,

1636
01:08:04,480 --> 01:08:06,610
they're the bad guys.
The media in this country,

1637
01:08:06,611 --> 01:08:07,444
there's been a systemic industry,
white failure to tell the truth in this 

1638
01:08:09,671 --> 01:08:10,031
country.
Well,

1639
01:08:10,031 --> 01:08:10,864
that's the normal situation under which 
the government steps in and that's what 

1640
01:08:12,851 --> 01:08:13,750
we do.
And it's oil.

1641
01:08:13,840 --> 01:08:14,673
That's what we do.
And it's some other kind of industry 

1642
01:08:15,591 --> 01:08:18,380
when there is a system wide failure in 
an industry banking,

1643
01:08:18,590 --> 01:08:21,500
for instance,
the government steps in and you know,

1644
01:08:21,530 --> 01:08:22,363
there's no reason why the first 
amendment should insulate you from the 

1645
01:08:25,011 --> 01:08:25,844
consequences of your actions if you go 
out and deliberately mendaciously 

1646
01:08:29,300 --> 01:08:32,900
knowingly lie about people in the key 
word is knowingly or unknowingly.

1647
01:08:32,930 --> 01:08:34,480
Now the libel standardization

1648
01:08:34,540 --> 01:08:36,010
country.
Slippery slope though.

1649
01:08:36,250 --> 01:08:39,970
Well I wouldn't say the guy who gets 
offended by Megan Kelly every other day,

1650
01:08:39,971 --> 01:08:41,380
God only knows what he thinks.
She's.

1651
01:08:41,530 --> 01:08:44,230
I think she's a hell of a lot more 
triggered by him than he is by her.

1652
01:08:44,490 --> 01:08:47,020
Well that may be,
but he's on his way to becoming the most

1653
01:08:47,021 --> 01:08:49,270
powerful man on earth.
And she's just a reporter.

1654
01:08:49,390 --> 01:08:52,000
So I get what you're saying that if she,
if she's telling the truth,

1655
01:08:52,210 --> 01:08:53,440
then fine.
But what I would say,

1656
01:08:53,450 --> 01:08:56,620
telling the truth when you have the most
defend,

1657
01:08:56,650 --> 01:08:58,780
you know,
this guy who loves giving a fence,

1658
01:08:58,781 --> 01:09:00,820
but at the same time he's incredibly 
thin skinned.

1659
01:09:01,530 --> 01:09:04,570
I don't think he's putting in libel law 
know the president can't do that.

1660
01:09:04,690 --> 01:09:05,920
He's not.
He's not thin skinned.

1661
01:09:05,921 --> 01:09:06,830
At all,
he is

1662
01:09:07,580 --> 01:09:12,580
very smart game where he is illustrating
the absurdities of the fence,

1663
01:09:13,260 --> 01:09:14,093
taking an offense culture.
It's the thing is you've got to 

1664
01:09:15,491 --> 01:09:16,430
understand about trump.
He didn't,

1665
01:09:16,431 --> 01:09:17,750
it didn't become a billionaire by 
accident.

1666
01:09:17,751 --> 01:09:20,030
He's one of the smartest people in the 
country,

1667
01:09:20,031 --> 01:09:21,620
you know,
he's so clever.

1668
01:09:21,860 --> 01:09:24,980
Everything he does is calculated.
Everything he does is designed to create

1669
01:09:24,981 --> 01:09:27,120
a particular effect or designed to,
uh,

1670
01:09:27,270 --> 01:09:28,103
to reach a certain goal.
So He'd been using bankruptcy to his 

1671
01:09:29,991 --> 01:09:31,990
advantage.
I guess we proved who wouldn't,

1672
01:09:31,991 --> 01:09:34,100
I mean,
liberals love to do this bullshit,

1673
01:09:34,610 --> 01:09:35,180
you know,
of course,

1674
01:09:35,180 --> 01:09:36,350
of course he did.
It was a business man.

1675
01:09:36,351 --> 01:09:38,450
Of course he donated to Hillary.
So would I,

1676
01:09:38,540 --> 01:09:41,090
if I was running a business and there 
was a strategic advantage,

1677
01:09:41,091 --> 01:09:44,240
I'd of course I go to a wedding,
I'd have her at my wedding or whatever.

1678
01:09:44,420 --> 01:09:46,340
That probably wasn't the best moment in 
the first debate.

1679
01:09:46,341 --> 01:09:47,950
When he admitted it is,

1680
01:09:48,100 --> 01:09:51,490
of course you would.
It's so dumbed suggest otherwise.

1681
01:09:51,670 --> 01:09:52,503
The reason it offends people so much.
And the reason it surprised me so much 

1682
01:09:54,611 --> 01:09:56,950
as most politicians have never done 
anything other than politics.

1683
01:09:57,100 --> 01:10:00,370
So if they cozy up to a liberal,
it looks like treachery or it looks like

1684
01:10:00,400 --> 01:10:01,233
inconsistency.
It looks like ideological kind of 

1685
01:10:03,520 --> 01:10:04,353
Tomfoolery.
While trump is never been in that 

1686
01:10:06,281 --> 01:10:07,330
position,
it was a business man.

1687
01:10:07,331 --> 01:10:08,164
Of course he did these things,
but I want to just finish on the press 

1688
01:10:10,361 --> 01:10:11,194
thing.
When trump says the press the bad guys 

1689
01:10:13,000 --> 01:10:13,833
and he doesn't need speech all the time.
It gets some of the biggest cheers of 

1690
01:10:16,121 --> 01:10:17,350
any of his stuff,
right?

1691
01:10:17,560 --> 01:10:18,161
When he says,
you know,

1692
01:10:18,161 --> 01:10:18,994
the press will never cover you.
The press will never turn around and 

1693
01:10:20,651 --> 01:10:22,930
show these huge crowds.
All they'll do is if there's a protest,

1694
01:10:22,931 --> 01:10:23,440
they'll go down there.

1695
01:10:23,440 --> 01:10:24,221
There's a protest.
They go,

1696
01:10:24,221 --> 01:10:26,050
these guys are losers.
They're losers.

1697
01:10:26,800 --> 01:10:29,500
They get some of the big those lines.
Get some of the biggest applause.

1698
01:10:29,501 --> 01:10:34,270
It's that country hates the press.
And when the press is like Pearl,

1699
01:10:34,271 --> 01:10:35,800
clutching a about,
you know,

1700
01:10:36,010 --> 01:10:38,020
Oh,
fifth amendment or freedom.

1701
01:10:38,200 --> 01:10:41,230
While you misused to those freedoms,
you abused those freedoms.

1702
01:10:41,231 --> 01:10:44,110
You started lying about men lying about 
race,

1703
01:10:44,200 --> 01:10:46,510
lying about immigration,
lying about Islam,

1704
01:10:46,511 --> 01:10:47,344
lying about everything that matters.
The press has lied systematically to 

1705
01:10:50,531 --> 01:10:54,550
everyone about everything everyday,
all the time for decades.

1706
01:10:54,760 --> 01:10:57,670
It has abused its its privileges and you
know,

1707
01:10:57,700 --> 01:11:01,210
frankly,
I'm with trump and with the and with the

1708
01:11:01,230 --> 01:11:02,710
most,
with most Americans,

1709
01:11:02,770 --> 01:11:05,920
the press is part of the problem and for
them to stop poor.

1710
01:11:05,921 --> 01:11:07,240
Clutching about the first amendment.
Well,

1711
01:11:07,241 --> 01:11:10,420
you know what tough,
you abused this for decades.

1712
01:11:10,500 --> 01:11:11,333
Okay,
so when you take the power that the 

1713
01:11:12,451 --> 01:11:14,190
press has a lot of power,

1714
01:11:14,460 --> 01:11:17,400
you take the power that the 
establishment has on both sides.

1715
01:11:17,430 --> 01:11:18,510
A lot of power,
Democrats,

1716
01:11:18,511 --> 01:11:19,410
Republicans,
right?

1717
01:11:19,620 --> 01:11:23,070
You add all that up and now we still 
don't have an election until November,

1718
01:11:23,100 --> 01:11:24,480
right?
We're in the end of March here.

1719
01:11:25,110 --> 01:11:28,230
Can this thing go forward without 
getting much more violent?

1720
01:11:28,290 --> 01:11:30,180
That's sort of where I see this all 
going.

1721
01:11:30,360 --> 01:11:31,193
And by the way,
I'll be very clear and say that I don't 

1722
01:11:32,701 --> 01:11:34,230
know which way the violence is going to 
come from.

1723
01:11:34,231 --> 01:11:36,050
I'm not going to say this.
Violence is gonna.

1724
01:11:36,070 --> 01:11:38,310
Just be honest.
It's going to come from.

1725
01:11:38,311 --> 01:11:40,440
So I don't think you should be such a 
weasel.

1726
01:11:40,441 --> 01:11:41,840
I think you should say what you think 
and I think,

1727
01:11:41,841 --> 01:11:45,090
I think you'd probably agree with me.
I was going to come from the left.

1728
01:11:45,091 --> 01:11:47,520
Just say it.
If it comes,

1729
01:11:47,930 --> 01:11:48,763
it goes down.
It's going to come from people 

1730
01:11:50,221 --> 01:11:51,720
protesting.
Trump is not going to come from trump.

1731
01:11:51,730 --> 01:11:54,450
Protesters will look in the beginning of
the shift and just pick.

1732
01:11:54,451 --> 01:11:56,850
Just because he is his chief of staff 
grab,

1733
01:11:56,880 --> 01:11:59,160
you know,
it can be a bit grabby.

1734
01:11:59,880 --> 01:12:01,870
Well of course he is the guy that trump 
is.

1735
01:12:02,040 --> 01:12:04,800
Trump is so,
so much risk of being shot.

1736
01:12:05,130 --> 01:12:05,963
I'm like anybody else?
If there's somebody that's gonna get 

1737
01:12:07,111 --> 01:12:08,790
assassinated in his country,
it's trump.

1738
01:12:08,791 --> 01:12:11,160
Is it any wonder the people close to him
a little bit cautious.

1739
01:12:11,340 --> 01:12:13,170
I don't get too much into that because 
it involves,

1740
01:12:13,200 --> 01:12:14,760
you know,
other people that used to work with.

1741
01:12:14,761 --> 01:12:15,960
But yeah,
but you know,

1742
01:12:16,740 --> 01:12:18,930
if there's going to be violence on the 
streets,

1743
01:12:19,290 --> 01:12:21,450
it is not going to come back.
So it will be the Bernie people.

1744
01:12:21,451 --> 01:12:23,760
I get that and that's not what.
That's ironic.

1745
01:12:23,850 --> 01:12:24,683
I tweeted the other day,
I like Bernie more than I like his 

1746
01:12:26,221 --> 01:12:29,070
supporters,
which is really how I feel because yes,

1747
01:12:29,071 --> 01:12:29,520
I do agree.

1748
01:12:29,520 --> 01:12:31,590
If he goes out,
they will have been.

1749
01:12:31,860 --> 01:12:32,790
Yeah,
I know you're right.

1750
01:12:32,791 --> 01:12:35,400
But I just thought as a human,
I think he's a decent human being,

1751
01:12:35,401 --> 01:12:36,960
whether I agree with his policies or 
not.

1752
01:12:36,980 --> 01:12:38,070
Well,
I just somebody,

1753
01:12:38,100 --> 01:12:42,240
somebody who makes excuses as to some of
the worst regimes in the world.

1754
01:12:42,241 --> 01:12:43,740
Somebody wants to,
wants to institute.

1755
01:12:43,741 --> 01:12:46,170
So it's to socialism,
which will make poor people poorer.

1756
01:12:46,350 --> 01:12:47,550
Somebody who wants to,
you know,

1757
01:12:47,760 --> 01:12:49,820
somebody who believes in the lies that,
uh,

1758
01:12:49,890 --> 01:12:50,723
the feminists,
we don't have to make this about him 

1759
01:12:52,711 --> 01:12:54,930
now.
Don't just throw this stuff out.

1760
01:12:55,130 --> 01:12:57,270
Do you really mean that?
Do you mean not?

1761
01:12:57,271 --> 01:12:59,440
You think he's a nice person?
I think he's a nice person.

1762
01:12:59,470 --> 01:13:02,630
I think he believes it more hateful,
more unequal.

1763
01:13:02,940 --> 01:13:05,250
I think that.
Why do you say it's a nice place in what

1764
01:13:05,251 --> 01:13:06,290
he thinks?
The solutions.

1765
01:13:06,310 --> 01:13:07,860
So you don't believe in any of his 
policies,

1766
01:13:07,861 --> 01:13:08,820
which you think is a nice person.

1767
01:13:08,850 --> 01:13:11,210
I think sometimes you can be a decent 
person and BNB,

1768
01:13:11,300 --> 01:13:14,110
wrong policies.
We got some continual regardless if they

1769
01:13:15,920 --> 01:13:17,600
hold on,
so the person is.

1770
01:13:17,910 --> 01:13:22,910
I do agree that the violence will comes 
from old and left wing,

1771
01:13:23,221 --> 01:13:25,170
that they're nice.
We don't do that with right wingers.

1772
01:13:25,320 --> 01:13:26,153
Why do we automatically assume just 
because it's old and doddery and he's 

1773
01:13:28,441 --> 01:13:30,670
got white hair and he sounds like a 
crazy old lunatic.

1774
01:13:30,680 --> 01:13:31,640
Oh,
it must be a nice guy,

1775
01:13:31,910 --> 01:13:34,280
but I think really nice guy.
No,

1776
01:13:34,380 --> 01:13:35,213
he wants socialism in America.
That's poisonous political philosophy 

1777
01:13:40,021 --> 01:13:43,550
that has made people suffer everywhere.
It has ever been tried everywhere.

1778
01:13:43,600 --> 01:13:45,540
Socialist.
I'm not pretending.

1779
01:13:46,240 --> 01:13:50,490
That's why Bernie Sanders is nice to get
it.

1780
01:13:51,050 --> 01:13:54,330
Why was he ever don't indicate the is a 
decent.

1781
01:13:54,331 --> 01:13:55,510
Nice.
I could see it.

1782
01:13:55,530 --> 01:13:56,363
I've never seen any underpinnings of the
ideas that he talks about of trying to 

1783
01:13:59,251 --> 01:14:01,170
make things more equal and trying to 
change the system,

1784
01:14:01,171 --> 01:14:05,580
which is the exact same stuff to feeling
body weight,

1785
01:14:05,640 --> 01:14:07,800
but you're telling me that,
that the trump revolution,

1786
01:14:08,190 --> 01:14:11,820
a revolution that has a little something
to do with the feeling broke,

1787
01:14:11,821 --> 01:14:13,450
but I don't want to get totally 
sidetracked on that.

1788
01:14:13,770 --> 01:14:15,700
It's not,
it's not a feeling.

1789
01:14:15,701 --> 01:14:16,900
It's not about feelings.
Well,

1790
01:14:16,901 --> 01:14:19,030
it has something to do with feelings.
You're telling me all these people,

1791
01:14:19,090 --> 01:14:22,020
and I'm agreeing with you on cultural 
libertarianism is not about feelings.

1792
01:14:22,060 --> 01:14:25,450
Cultural Libertarianism is a response to
a feelings over facts.

1793
01:14:25,451 --> 01:14:26,284
In fact,
that the defining characteristic of 

1794
01:14:26,981 --> 01:14:27,814
cultural libertarianism is a rigorous 
adherence to evidence based policy 

1795
01:14:31,571 --> 01:14:33,420
making in evidence based beliefs.
And,

1796
01:14:33,480 --> 01:14:34,101
and,
and,

1797
01:14:34,101 --> 01:14:34,720
uh,
and uh,

1798
01:14:34,720 --> 01:14:37,240
a rigorous insistence on classical 
liberalism.

1799
01:14:37,241 --> 01:14:38,074
It's got very little to do with feelings
scholars do with thumb because it's 

1800
01:14:40,091 --> 01:14:42,040
often dressed up in a mischievous 
package.

1801
01:14:42,250 --> 01:14:43,083
But the cultural libertarianism is a 
reaction against the feelings based 

1802
01:14:45,551 --> 01:14:47,830
arguments of the left.
The feelings makes arguments to the left

1803
01:14:48,070 --> 01:14:48,903
as perfectly lead by Bernie Sanders.
Bernie Sanders is the apotheosis of 

1804
01:14:51,731 --> 01:14:53,770
everything you hate 'em,
but you still feel the need to call them

1805
01:14:53,771 --> 01:14:55,030
a nice guy because he's old.

1806
01:14:55,590 --> 01:14:56,423
Alright,
so without getting into a Bernie 

1807
01:14:58,601 --> 01:15:00,430
offshoot here,
we're probably a little late for that.

1808
01:15:01,000 --> 01:15:04,480
I will grant you that if Bernie goes 
down and the.

1809
01:15:04,540 --> 01:15:06,370
The narrative just continues.
Yes,

1810
01:15:06,371 --> 01:15:09,760
it will be his people.
I think that will be violent right now.

1811
01:15:09,761 --> 01:15:10,594
The media.
Then we'll try to blame it on the trump 

1812
01:15:11,771 --> 01:15:12,820
people.
And that doesn't mean that there were no

1813
01:15:12,821 --> 01:15:13,654
trump.
People that are violent declaratives 

1814
01:15:14,860 --> 01:15:16,950
conservatives are blaming it on trump.
I mean it was,

1815
01:15:16,951 --> 01:15:21,220
it cruise goes on cv the next day after 
whatever st trump is responsible for the

1816
01:15:21,221 --> 01:15:22,690
violence.
Are they insane?

1817
01:15:22,710 --> 01:15:23,543
Okay.
So do they not realize why people are 

1818
01:15:24,521 --> 01:15:25,354
voting for this guy?
They were voting for this guy because 

1819
01:15:26,591 --> 01:15:30,460
you lie like that.
It's astonishing.

1820
01:15:30,520 --> 01:15:31,660
Anyway,
so at the top of the show,

1821
01:15:31,661 --> 01:15:33,160
what I mentioned was that just this 
week,

1822
01:15:33,161 --> 01:15:36,790
trump was giving a speech in Arizona and
these protesters blocked the road.

1823
01:15:37,060 --> 01:15:37,893
These are not people.
They think they're doing something good 

1824
01:15:40,120 --> 01:15:41,620
or they're doing something to stop 
trump.

1825
01:15:41,621 --> 01:15:42,470
But,
but they're all there,

1826
01:15:43,080 --> 01:15:46,090
the rest is just taking a paycheck from 
could whatever it is,

1827
01:15:46,240 --> 01:15:50,200
but they think that they're stopping 
trump somehow or stopping him from being

1828
01:15:50,201 --> 01:15:51,034
heard are going to stop his movement.
But I think all they're doing is 

1829
01:15:52,421 --> 01:15:53,254
strengthening him because they need to 
have the basket of ideas because then 

1830
01:15:55,361 --> 01:15:57,700
people turn on the wall.
Look what these people are doing.

1831
01:15:57,730 --> 01:15:58,563
The more these guys protest Daddy,
the more they show up and they're 

1832
01:16:01,331 --> 01:16:03,160
violent.
It's just like my toxicologist,

1833
01:16:03,161 --> 01:16:05,080
you know,
there's these feminists smeared blood on

1834
01:16:05,081 --> 01:16:06,880
themselves rather than the block.
All the stuff.

1835
01:16:06,881 --> 01:16:08,350
Everybody saw the video.
Um,

1836
01:16:08,380 --> 01:16:09,310
you know,
everybody's suing.

1837
01:16:09,311 --> 01:16:10,900
Everybody thought the same thing.
God,

1838
01:16:10,901 --> 01:16:11,800
mine,
I must have a point.

1839
01:16:12,880 --> 01:16:15,820
That's what they thought.
And everybody thinks the same thing when

1840
01:16:15,880 --> 01:16:16,690
I'm,
you know,

1841
01:16:16,690 --> 01:16:20,140
when these protesters show up for trump 
and they are the hateful,

1842
01:16:20,141 --> 01:16:21,250
angry,
violent,

1843
01:16:21,251 --> 01:16:22,180
divisive people.

1844
01:16:22,180 --> 01:16:24,070
And everybody there for trump is like 
laughing.

1845
01:16:24,280 --> 01:16:26,260
They'll run their hats,
make America great again.

1846
01:16:26,280 --> 01:16:28,300
But it's not everybody.
You'll grant me that,

1847
01:16:28,301 --> 01:16:29,134
right?
It's not every day I saw a guy who was 

1848
01:16:29,980 --> 01:16:32,050
screaming at some people go back to 
Auschwitz.

1849
01:16:32,051 --> 01:16:34,180
You see some people go back to Africa,
I mean,

1850
01:16:34,360 --> 01:16:35,193
but yes,
every mood media is cherry picked a few 

1851
01:16:37,061 --> 01:16:38,460
from this side versus the view from the 
outside.

1852
01:16:38,470 --> 01:16:39,340
This is not,
this is not,

1853
01:16:39,341 --> 01:16:40,860
you know,
I'm just saying it's not,

1854
01:16:40,861 --> 01:16:41,694
it's not everybody.
I'm not giving the media and he greatly 

1855
01:16:43,180 --> 01:16:44,013
here.
No.

1856
01:16:44,040 --> 01:16:44,470
Well,
I mean,

1857
01:16:44,470 --> 01:16:45,011
okay,
there.

1858
01:16:45,011 --> 01:16:47,380
I'm sure they're awesome supporters of 
trump who are,

1859
01:16:47,381 --> 01:16:48,214
you know,
who are distasteful people like there 

1860
01:16:49,481 --> 01:16:51,260
are supporters of Hillary.
Sure.

1861
01:16:51,460 --> 01:16:53,980
I think pretty much anyone who supports 
her at this point just tasteful,

1862
01:16:54,590 --> 01:16:55,423
you know,
I think pretty much anyone support 

1863
01:16:56,380 --> 01:16:58,990
sanders is just needs to,
needs to read a book.

1864
01:16:59,080 --> 01:16:59,980
Um,
you know,

1865
01:17:00,490 --> 01:17:01,720
needs to be educated,
needs to,

1866
01:17:02,050 --> 01:17:03,610
needs to reach puberty.
I don't know.

1867
01:17:04,390 --> 01:17:08,990
But the thing is about trump supporters 
in my experience,

1868
01:17:09,040 --> 01:17:10,130
vast majority

1869
01:17:10,130 --> 01:17:10,963
of them,
whether they fall into the various 

1870
01:17:12,531 --> 01:17:13,860
buckets of trump supporter,
you know,

1871
01:17:13,880 --> 01:17:14,713
whether it's the huge support he has in 
the black community for all sorts of 

1872
01:17:17,151 --> 01:17:18,860
obvious reasons because he's a very 
aspirational,

1873
01:17:19,160 --> 01:17:20,540
you know,
American dream kind of candidate.

1874
01:17:20,800 --> 01:17:22,370
Um,
my colleague at Breitbart,

1875
01:17:22,371 --> 01:17:23,031
Sandy Johnson,
you know,

1876
01:17:23,031 --> 01:17:24,170
she says,
she says I love him,

1877
01:17:24,171 --> 01:17:27,380
I love him because when I see trump and 
his name on a building and it got a name

1878
01:17:27,381 --> 01:17:28,570
on a plane,
I want that,

1879
01:17:28,620 --> 01:17:30,440
you know,
that element to it.

1880
01:17:30,580 --> 01:17:31,250
Yeah.
It's not,

1881
01:17:31,250 --> 01:17:32,083
well,
it's not just that some people are 

1882
01:17:32,661 --> 01:17:33,980
offended by that kind of generalization,
but.

1883
01:17:35,250 --> 01:17:36,040
Oh,
there,

1884
01:17:36,040 --> 01:17:37,450
I said something that I thought you'd 
be,

1885
01:17:37,451 --> 01:17:39,160
oh my God,
he said bling and now.

1886
01:17:39,161 --> 01:17:40,000
No,
no,

1887
01:17:40,120 --> 01:17:44,470
that was a bit much.
Maybe that's why they like me.

1888
01:17:44,800 --> 01:17:45,391
Uh,
no,

1889
01:17:45,391 --> 01:17:46,224
I,
um,

1890
01:17:46,480 --> 01:17:47,570
you know what I mean is,
you know,

1891
01:17:47,690 --> 01:17:48,523
that he's a,
he's a very classic aspirational 

1892
01:17:50,011 --> 01:17:51,540
candidate for,
for black Americans,

1893
01:17:52,050 --> 01:17:52,883
also loved by the gay community.
Huge gay icon as a piece coming out in 

1894
01:17:55,080 --> 01:17:55,810
Mike,
I think,

1895
01:17:55,810 --> 01:17:56,643
and another in vice soon.
I've given interviews for both of these 

1896
01:17:59,161 --> 01:18:01,200
places on why so many gay people love 
trump.

1897
01:18:01,201 --> 01:18:02,230
I think obviously.
Um,

1898
01:18:02,880 --> 01:18:03,211
but,
uh,

1899
01:18:03,211 --> 01:18:04,044
you know,
all that,

1900
01:18:04,050 --> 01:18:06,780
but the two big groups which are kind of
like well-educated,

1901
01:18:06,980 --> 01:18:09,880
sort of what I call generation from the 
Internet trolley,

1902
01:18:09,930 --> 01:18:10,763
some outright he cultural libertarian 
sort of trump supporters who by and 

1903
01:18:14,221 --> 01:18:15,054
large are the best people in the world.
It's so funny and interesting and smart 

1904
01:18:19,111 --> 01:18:21,870
and brilliant and I love them.
And the other group which had also the,

1905
01:18:21,871 --> 01:18:22,380
you know,
the,

1906
01:18:22,380 --> 01:18:23,760
the,
some of the best people in the world,

1907
01:18:23,980 --> 01:18:24,920
um,
you know,

1908
01:18:24,921 --> 01:18:28,340
the,
the white working class who are,

1909
01:18:28,400 --> 01:18:29,233
you know,
who will rightly worried about the 

1910
01:18:30,121 --> 01:18:32,310
direction of the company that the 
country is taking

1911
01:18:32,310 --> 01:18:33,143
the company.
See soon it'll be a company that was 

1912
01:18:35,960 --> 01:18:38,720
looking for me.
It took an hour,

1913
01:18:38,920 --> 01:18:43,920
but you see fascism comes with a smile 
and bleach blonde hair.

1914
01:18:46,130 --> 01:18:49,820
I'm going to start calling it the firm.
We've got to fix the phone.

1915
01:18:49,860 --> 01:18:50,710
Basically you're saying that

1916
01:18:50,740 --> 01:18:53,340
these two groups,
the queen calls a royal family,

1917
01:18:53,360 --> 01:18:54,220
the firm,
I think in England,

1918
01:18:54,350 --> 01:18:56,950
she,
so these two groups coming together,

1919
01:18:56,951 --> 01:18:58,450
it will just have it.
Look,

1920
01:18:58,451 --> 01:19:00,350
I feel happy,
joyful,

1921
01:19:00,350 --> 01:19:01,183
wonderful people and I love them and 
they're both of these groups in my 

1922
01:19:04,611 --> 01:19:05,444
natural constituency,
both of these groups in my readers and 

1923
01:19:07,071 --> 01:19:08,390
my viewers,
both of these groups,

1924
01:19:08,391 --> 01:19:12,200
I think hold with them united under,
under Daddy,

1925
01:19:12,201 --> 01:19:15,060
the promise of a better America.
I say that with no hint of,

1926
01:19:15,120 --> 01:19:17,300
of exaggeration.
I think these,

1927
01:19:17,330 --> 01:19:18,530
you know,
these groups,

1928
01:19:18,800 --> 01:19:20,330
think about the Gamer Gate,
you know,

1929
01:19:20,630 --> 01:19:21,680
saying when,
when,

1930
01:19:22,040 --> 01:19:24,960
um,
video game players the least likely kind

1931
01:19:24,961 --> 01:19:25,794
of group in the,
in the world to rise up and beat the 

1932
01:19:27,321 --> 01:19:28,154
feminists.
And they did beat the feminist and they 

1933
01:19:28,801 --> 01:19:29,451
were like,
really?

1934
01:19:29,451 --> 01:19:30,100
These,
you know,

1935
01:19:30,100 --> 01:19:33,320
everyone was thinking these parents' 
basement guys and video games really?

1936
01:19:33,470 --> 01:19:34,760
And they won.
They did what?

1937
01:19:34,761 --> 01:19:36,020
Nobody,
none of the rest of us had done.

1938
01:19:36,050 --> 01:19:38,390
Well,
they woke this thing that I did not know

1939
01:19:38,391 --> 01:19:41,240
that this was happening as a direct sort
of,

1940
01:19:41,290 --> 01:19:42,123
um,
tributary to enter intergeneration 

1941
01:19:45,051 --> 01:19:46,110
trump,
um,

1942
01:19:46,130 --> 01:19:46,741
you know,
and,

1943
01:19:46,741 --> 01:19:49,940
and they work people up to the fact that
if you turn around as a progressive left

1944
01:19:49,970 --> 01:19:52,250
and you say,
I'm not sexist,

1945
01:19:52,850 --> 01:19:53,750
go fuck yourself.

1946
01:19:54,290 --> 01:19:56,450
Nothing bad happens.
And in fact,

1947
01:19:56,900 --> 01:19:58,910
other people around you start to notice 
and they start to do it too.

1948
01:19:59,480 --> 01:20:02,480
And these two groups together,
white working class,

1949
01:20:02,570 --> 01:20:03,430
um,
you know,

1950
01:20:03,710 --> 01:20:04,543
ordinary people who've seen wages 
depressed and worried about where the 

1951
01:20:07,050 --> 01:20:10,750
country is going and that very highly 
in,

1952
01:20:10,760 --> 01:20:11,593
in a,
in a sort of highly education college 

1953
01:20:13,291 --> 01:20:17,190
student and into their,
up to about 35 kind of cross like gen x,

1954
01:20:17,191 --> 01:20:18,024
millennial,
borderline people our age who are sick 

1955
01:20:22,080 --> 01:20:26,040
of having been told what to do for 10 
years by the aggressive regressive left.

1956
01:20:26,370 --> 01:20:30,530
This union of people,
the what I call generation trump is,

1957
01:20:30,531 --> 01:20:33,140
um,
is the most exciting cultural force that

1958
01:20:33,141 --> 01:20:35,850
has been in this country for decades.
Um,

1959
01:20:36,150 --> 01:20:36,983
and it's,
it's a group of people that I'm very 

1960
01:20:38,641 --> 01:20:39,474
proud to be part of them to,
to have a role in because I think 

1961
01:20:43,081 --> 01:20:44,100
they're great.
And I think,

1962
01:20:44,101 --> 01:20:47,700
um,
I think many of these people,

1963
01:20:47,760 --> 01:20:51,060
whether it's the gamers in that top end 
or the,

1964
01:20:51,061 --> 01:20:52,080
you know,
people who just,

1965
01:20:52,200 --> 01:20:54,060
people just drive,
drive trucks for a living,

1966
01:20:54,061 --> 01:20:54,360
whatever.

1967
01:20:54,360 --> 01:20:55,193
These are some of the people who have 
been lied to and lied about the most in 

1968
01:20:57,931 --> 01:20:58,764
American Society for decades and they're
sick of it and they're right to be sick 

1969
01:21:01,651 --> 01:21:02,350
of it.
Um,

1970
01:21:02,350 --> 01:21:03,900
and if they can drive into the White 
House,

1971
01:21:03,901 --> 01:21:06,560
a candidate like trump who is going to 
build a wall,

1972
01:21:06,561 --> 01:21:09,030
he's going to fix trade is going to do 
these things.

1973
01:21:09,031 --> 01:21:11,610
And then if he doesn't do too much else,
that's not such a disaster.

1974
01:21:12,000 --> 01:21:12,833
I'm a candidate like trump who is going 
to give the president establishment 

1975
01:21:17,250 --> 01:21:18,083
journalists and politicians are like the
most colossal bloody nose and they 

1976
01:21:21,691 --> 01:21:23,280
deserve it.
They have it coming,

1977
01:21:23,490 --> 01:21:25,260
you know,
they really deserve this.

1978
01:21:25,510 --> 01:21:26,810
Then I am fully behind it.

1979
01:21:26,960 --> 01:21:28,040
Yeah.
And ironically,

1980
01:21:28,041 --> 01:21:28,874
I think at that point you could make a 
strong case that if Bernie does not get 

1981
01:21:32,631 --> 01:21:33,464
the Democratic nomination,
that he should actually have a good 

1982
01:21:34,971 --> 01:21:35,804
portion of his people should actually go
to trump because he's knows whether you 

1983
01:21:38,421 --> 01:21:40,890
agree with Bernie or Hillary.

1984
01:21:41,040 --> 01:21:42,450
Obviously you're going to get the 
nomination.

1985
01:21:43,290 --> 01:21:44,123
But the good thing about trump,
good thing that one of the things about 

1986
01:21:47,851 --> 01:21:48,684
Saunas and trump supporters is a 
relatively politically promiscuous that 

1987
01:21:51,751 --> 01:21:56,130
they want is to hurt the bad guys and 
the bad guys now the New York Times,

1988
01:21:56,160 --> 01:21:59,280
you know,
the political class,

1989
01:21:59,281 --> 01:22:00,091
the banks,
whatever,

1990
01:22:00,091 --> 01:22:01,680
you know,
all these people that um,

1991
01:22:01,840 --> 01:22:02,673
that,
you know,

1992
01:22:03,900 --> 01:22:06,480
controlling the rest of us and knowing 
our own it not in our interests.

1993
01:22:07,030 --> 01:22:07,863
Um,
I think many of them will come over and 

1994
01:22:10,051 --> 01:22:10,884
I think you'd be surprised just how many
come over because their concerns aren't 

1995
01:22:13,621 --> 01:22:15,410
that different.
And when you look at,

1996
01:22:15,411 --> 01:22:18,660
um,
if you look at like the saunders rallies

1997
01:22:18,661 --> 01:22:21,480
and look at the trump rallies,
there's this similar sort of,

1998
01:22:21,570 --> 01:22:22,403
there's a sort of fun young,
exciting kind of atmosphere in both the 

1999
01:22:28,381 --> 01:22:30,120
crowds.
They have a very similar feel to them.

2000
01:22:30,420 --> 01:22:31,253
The atmosphere at those events is in 
many ways very similar and I think 

2001
01:22:35,371 --> 01:22:36,204
people are more interested in the sort 
of cultural ties across political lines 

2002
01:22:39,481 --> 01:22:42,720
these days than they are with Republican
and Democrat labels.

2003
01:22:42,840 --> 01:22:43,170
Right,
right.

2004
01:22:43,170 --> 01:22:45,540
So those cultural ties,
that's really what brought us together.

2005
01:22:45,541 --> 01:22:50,250
So I guess to wrap all this thing up,
is that the left,

2006
01:22:50,251 --> 01:22:51,084
that portion of the left that you would 
argue is probably 90 percent of the 

2007
01:22:53,251 --> 01:22:55,830
left,
if not 100 percent plus me and one other

2008
01:22:55,831 --> 01:22:56,750
guy.
Uh,

2009
01:22:56,790 --> 01:22:58,000
but that will leave.
Yeah.

2010
01:22:58,060 --> 01:22:58,621
So.
Alright.

2011
01:22:58,621 --> 01:23:00,600
So you got million libertarian before.
So between.

2012
01:23:00,860 --> 01:23:01,480
Yeah.
Well I,

2013
01:23:01,480 --> 01:23:02,313
I,
at this point I would basically say I'm 

2014
01:23:02,851 --> 01:23:05,140
a classical liberal libertarian 
somewhere in there.

2015
01:23:05,350 --> 01:23:06,160
Um,
which actually,

2016
01:23:06,160 --> 01:23:07,510
believe it or not,
people don't like to hear it,

2017
01:23:07,511 --> 01:23:09,460
but it's actually on the conservative 
side.

2018
01:23:09,461 --> 01:23:11,620
If you looked at liberal is watching 
this,

2019
01:23:11,621 --> 01:23:12,700
you did this to him.
I mean,

2020
01:23:12,701 --> 01:23:13,534
you know,
you,

2021
01:23:14,540 --> 01:23:17,230
you forced leftists,
perfectly nice,

2022
01:23:17,340 --> 01:23:19,780
you know,
domesticated liberal,

2023
01:23:19,781 --> 01:23:22,690
gay man into talking about free speech 
on the Internet.

2024
01:23:22,720 --> 01:23:24,700
You know,
crazy what happened here.

2025
01:23:24,760 --> 01:23:25,593
But see if they did something good 
between the regressive left and the 

2026
01:23:30,401 --> 01:23:33,670
authoritarians that between the power 
structure of the media,

2027
01:23:33,671 --> 01:23:34,540
the politicians,
all that,

2028
01:23:34,720 --> 01:23:35,553
they did wake this thing up and that's 
why me and you can sit here and do this 

2029
01:23:38,771 --> 01:23:41,920
and still have a drink after and agree 
and disagree and whatever.

2030
01:23:41,980 --> 01:23:44,960
And you did a good sell job,
you didn't bring me all the way but you,

2031
01:23:45,010 --> 01:23:48,070
but you lay out an interesting case and 
that's what I'm interested in hearing,

2032
01:23:48,400 --> 01:23:49,233
you know?
And so they did do something because 

2033
01:23:50,981 --> 01:23:51,814
they all have the people that are in 
this mix now that we talk about all the 

2034
01:23:54,971 --> 01:23:55,421
time,
you know,

2035
01:23:55,421 --> 01:23:59,230
from Rogan and Christina Hoff summers 
and you know,

2036
01:23:59,231 --> 01:24:03,670
Sam Harris and budget and all of these 
people all over the map have woken up.

2037
01:24:03,670 --> 01:24:04,503
So that to me is the takeaway that I can
feel good about with this regardless of 

2038
01:24:07,541 --> 01:24:10,660
who becomes president regardless of the 
political end of this,

2039
01:24:10,850 --> 01:24:12,640
that we're here and we're doing this.
And that's what,

2040
01:24:12,820 --> 01:24:14,770
that's what the authoritarians on either
side fear the most.

2041
01:24:14,860 --> 01:24:15,770
Correct.
And it's.

2042
01:24:15,820 --> 01:24:19,060
And I think it's an extra bowl.
I think it is irresistible.

2043
01:24:19,210 --> 01:24:20,043
If you look at the 19 nineties,
the emergence of political correctness 

2044
01:24:22,181 --> 01:24:23,014
in the 19 nineties,
which was beaten back very successfully 

2045
01:24:25,151 --> 01:24:28,000
by coalition like us.
We're the ones doing it now.

2046
01:24:29,170 --> 01:24:31,570
And although in the nineties,
these people,

2047
01:24:31,571 --> 01:24:32,404
as Christine Alexis,
I got the assistant professorships and 

2048
01:24:33,971 --> 01:24:34,804
you know,
stayed in tenure and the and the 

2049
01:24:35,450 --> 01:24:36,283
universities and all the rest of it had 
to go away from the media but never 

2050
01:24:40,481 --> 01:24:41,314
really went away.
They just sort of consolidated their 

2051
01:24:42,971 --> 01:24:45,190
power and returned as social justice 
warriors.

2052
01:24:45,580 --> 01:24:48,720
This time there's so much more on the 
line for them because if it,

2053
01:24:48,721 --> 01:24:51,610
if they break this time,
they all breaking.

2054
01:24:52,140 --> 01:24:54,940
They all losing with the full support of
politicians,

2055
01:24:54,970 --> 01:24:57,100
the media and academia.
And if,

2056
01:24:57,160 --> 01:24:57,993
if people rise up now and say,
this social justice thing is language 

2057
01:25:01,421 --> 01:25:02,650
policing,
this political correctness,

2058
01:25:02,651 --> 01:25:05,200
safe spaces,
trigger warnings and microaggressions,

2059
01:25:05,201 --> 01:25:06,034
this stuff is horseshit.
And if enough people smash it 

2060
01:25:09,680 --> 01:25:12,910
stranglehold on the public square,
it will never recover.

2061
01:25:13,450 --> 01:25:14,283
It will never go.
Never come back in a like this again 

2062
01:25:16,750 --> 01:25:19,330
because it will lose at the height of 
its powers.

2063
01:25:19,360 --> 01:25:21,670
It will lose in its strongest possible 
form.

2064
01:25:21,671 --> 01:25:22,910
It will lose,
as we say in,

2065
01:25:23,010 --> 01:25:24,010
you know,
in the Internet,

2066
01:25:24,190 --> 01:25:25,023
in its final form,
social justice cannot get any stronger 

2067
01:25:27,131 --> 01:25:27,990
than it is now.
Um,

2068
01:25:28,030 --> 01:25:28,990
it is,
it is at,

2069
01:25:28,991 --> 01:25:31,660
it's at the peak of its powers and it's 
losing.

2070
01:25:32,480 --> 01:25:36,550
It's losing because people want freedom.
They want to be able to do,

2071
01:25:36,580 --> 01:25:37,540
say,
think,

2072
01:25:37,600 --> 01:25:40,740
be,
play and read anything and they have the

2073
01:25:40,750 --> 01:25:41,583
faith in themselves and in other people 
that they are able to make the best 

2074
01:25:46,181 --> 01:25:47,980
judgments for themselves and what they 
believe in.

2075
01:25:48,310 --> 01:25:49,143
They don't need to be told how to speak.
They don't need to be told which books 

2076
01:25:51,521 --> 01:25:52,354
to read.
They don't need to be told which video 

2077
01:25:53,681 --> 01:25:54,514
games a dangerous.
They don't need to be told any of these 

2078
01:25:56,501 --> 01:25:57,334
things.
They don't need to be instructed and 

2079
01:25:58,241 --> 01:25:59,074
lectured to by politicians.
They don't need to be badgered and 

2080
01:26:00,701 --> 01:26:04,010
hectored by feminists and they don't 
need to be lied to by journalists

2081
01:26:04,190 --> 01:26:05,023
and people are sick of it and they are 
sick of the entire mendacious edifice 

2082
01:26:09,620 --> 01:26:10,453
and this is what has happening so 
wonderfully right now with people like 

2083
01:26:12,201 --> 01:26:13,034
us and all the other conversations that 
are happening in cultural libertarian 

2084
01:26:15,231 --> 01:26:16,064
movement and in general what I call 
generation trump and data and all this 

2085
01:26:18,231 --> 01:26:19,220
kind of stuff.
The Fun,

2086
01:26:19,520 --> 01:26:21,620
mischievous trolley element on the 
Internet.

2087
01:26:21,621 --> 01:26:22,454
What is behind all of this?
The heart of all of this is that 

2088
01:26:25,520 --> 01:26:26,353
rejection,
that fundamental rejection of the idea 

2089
01:26:28,281 --> 01:26:30,830
that somebody else knows better than I 
do.

2090
01:26:31,070 --> 01:26:32,330
How I should live my life,

2091
01:26:32,860 --> 01:26:34,420
man.
You know how to give a closing argument.

2092
01:26:34,520 --> 01:26:35,353
I was really good,
right?

2093
01:26:36,870 --> 01:26:37,703
No cue cards over there at all in the 
hands of professionals here for the 

2094
01:26:40,511 --> 01:26:42,760
record.
I did not look at these once.

2095
01:26:42,761 --> 01:26:45,940
I had a lot of questions for you,
but I think we did a fine job here.

2096
01:26:46,080 --> 01:26:46,913
Uh,
so of course I want to thank Miley 

2097
01:26:48,420 --> 01:26:49,520
Annapolis for joining me.
Thanks.

2098
01:26:49,670 --> 01:26:52,330
You guys can check out all his stuff at,
uh,

2099
01:26:52,331 --> 01:26:55,150
at Breitbart.com.
Follow him on twitter.

2100
01:26:55,360 --> 01:26:57,970
It's at Nero.
There are roughly how many,

2101
01:26:58,030 --> 01:26:58,863
how many copies of Youtube,
but I think I'm the most imitation 

2102
01:27:00,510 --> 01:27:01,340
personal internet who,
yeah,

2103
01:27:01,340 --> 01:27:02,173
they created.
They created a Gremlin in water monster 

2104
01:27:04,121 --> 01:27:04,954
with you.
How many?

2105
01:27:04,970 --> 01:27:05,803
Really

2106
01:27:05,920 --> 01:27:08,680
after midnight.
I don't know,

2107
01:27:08,681 --> 01:27:11,860
but if you have any audio like the 
emperor who was awesome.

2108
01:27:12,100 --> 01:27:13,630
Um,
except for the Christian running,

2109
01:27:13,810 --> 01:27:14,920
everything else looks great.
Perfect.

2110
01:27:15,160 --> 01:27:16,210
Nobody's perfect.
Whenever is good.

2111
01:27:16,211 --> 01:27:16,751
You know,
he was,

2112
01:27:16,751 --> 01:27:17,291
he was,
I mean,

2113
01:27:17,291 --> 01:27:19,000
he was an egotist fine,
I'll take that.

2114
01:27:19,210 --> 01:27:20,440
You know,
he was self involved,

2115
01:27:20,441 --> 01:27:22,420
was fine.
He was spent too much money on himself,

2116
01:27:22,421 --> 01:27:23,700
you know,
he raised half of Rome,

2117
01:27:24,880 --> 01:27:27,440
a gigantic palace called the Dermis 
area.

2118
01:27:27,700 --> 01:27:29,200
When he finally moved into the,
uh,

2119
01:27:29,330 --> 01:27:30,760
into the palace,
he,

2120
01:27:30,761 --> 01:27:32,980
I think is,
I think it was instantaneous.

2121
01:27:32,981 --> 01:27:34,030
I think he said to him,
finally,

2122
01:27:34,031 --> 01:27:37,960
I can start live as a human being.
I was hated by the elites.

2123
01:27:37,961 --> 01:27:39,670
There's senate,
hated him but loved by the people.

2124
01:27:39,760 --> 01:27:40,390
So,
um,

2125
01:27:40,390 --> 01:27:41,380
um,
he was a good.

2126
01:27:41,390 --> 01:27:42,360
It was probably the best time.

2127
01:27:42,470 --> 01:27:46,360
So you want to throw this country to 
accompany or do you want your palettes?

2128
01:27:46,380 --> 01:27:50,780
I got nobody who wouldn't want to live 
in neuropathy.

2129
01:27:51,090 --> 01:27:53,120
There is no blue check,
but just take my word for it.

2130
01:27:54,160 --> 01:27:55,070
We'll do it again next week.
