1
00:00:01,200 --> 00:00:02,033
No.

2
00:00:05,190 --> 00:00:06,023
All right.
Before I get to what's going on in the 

3
00:00:06,811 --> 00:00:07,644
world this week,
I want to once again thank all of you 

4
00:00:09,151 --> 00:00:11,820
who support what we do here on the Rubin
report.

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,840
I'm thrilled to finally be able to show 
you our brand new home studio today.

6
00:00:16,170 --> 00:00:18,480
It took a tremendous amount of blood,
sweat,

7
00:00:18,510 --> 00:00:19,680
tears,
and yeah,

8
00:00:19,681 --> 00:00:23,460
even money to build it and we simply 
could not have done it without you.

9
00:00:23,850 --> 00:00:24,683
Of course,
the main thanks goes out to all of you 

10
00:00:25,801 --> 00:00:28,290
who donate monthly to the show on 
Patrion.

11
00:00:28,530 --> 00:00:29,363
As you guys give us the budget to create
content as we see fit with no 

12
00:00:32,281 --> 00:00:33,660
executives,
bosses,

13
00:00:33,661 --> 00:00:37,230
or middlemen between me and you beyond 
our patrons.

14
00:00:37,231 --> 00:00:38,064
I also want to thank all of those who 
have given one time donations on paypal 

15
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:46,230
as well as to all of you who watch light
comment on and share our videos with our

16
00:00:46,231 --> 00:00:47,130
new home studio.

17
00:00:47,130 --> 00:00:50,280
We can fully expand on everything we've 
been building here,

18
00:00:50,281 --> 00:00:52,590
including more shows,
longer interviews,

19
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:53,633
and new segments.
I truly believe that the ideas of 

20
00:00:56,101 --> 00:00:57,900
classical liberalism,
logic,

21
00:00:57,901 --> 00:00:58,734
reason,
and individual liberty are the only 

22
00:01:00,451 --> 00:01:04,920
solution to the authoritarian and 
extremist problems we're seeing all over

23
00:01:04,921 --> 00:01:07,920
the world right now.
I'll continue to have conversations with

24
00:01:07,921 --> 00:01:11,910
people I both agree with and disagree 
with and just as importantly,

25
00:01:11,911 --> 00:01:12,744
I'll continue to listen to you from my 
Patriot on one on one chats to group 

26
00:01:16,891 --> 00:01:19,590
Google hangouts to emails and yeah,
even twitter,

27
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:23,550
you guys consistently amaze me at your 
insight and desire for truth.

28
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:24,833
My commute is now just 10 steps down the
hall from my bedroom and I promised to 

29
00:01:29,161 --> 00:01:32,610
use that new found time to make this 
show even better than before.

30
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:33,833
You've truly helped my dreams become a 
reality and somehow we're right back at 

31
00:01:36,601 --> 00:01:37,434
the beginning.

32
00:01:38,190 --> 00:01:40,740
In the course of the month that we were 
building this studio,

33
00:01:40,741 --> 00:01:43,770
basically a million things happened.
I'm not sure if you've heard about this,

34
00:01:43,771 --> 00:01:47,280
but we had an election in the United 
States and Donald Trump.

35
00:01:47,281 --> 00:01:50,040
Yeah,
Donald Trump is now the president elect.

36
00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:53,790
While most of the media seemed to be 
completely blindsided by the results,

37
00:01:53,791 --> 00:01:54,624
I can honestly say that I wasn't.
I talked to and listen to people like 

38
00:01:58,381 --> 00:02:00,060
Scott Adams,
Milo Yiannopoulos,

39
00:02:00,061 --> 00:02:03,060
and Mike Cernovich,
and whether I agreed with them or not,

40
00:02:03,061 --> 00:02:06,780
I realized that there was a real 
political movement behind their words.

41
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:08,033
When you couple this reality with 
moderate liberals and moderate 

42
00:02:10,831 --> 00:02:14,640
conservatives who are sick of identity 
politics and outrage culture,

43
00:02:14,850 --> 00:02:18,660
trump winning actually seems kind of 
obvious in hindsight.

44
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:20,393
I'm trying to do my best not to judge 
trump's actions until he's actually an 

45
00:02:24,061 --> 00:02:24,894
office because until then,
everything people are saying are just 

46
00:02:27,451 --> 00:02:28,860
guesses and conjecture.

47
00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:31,470
As I said in my direct message right 
after the election,

48
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:34,980
I'll be the first to hold trump,
speak to the fire once he's in office,

49
00:02:35,250 --> 00:02:36,083
but the simple fact is that he's the 
president elect now and we've got to 

50
00:02:39,181 --> 00:02:42,900
give him a chance.
That's the rub of democracy.

51
00:02:42,901 --> 00:02:43,734
Your team doesn't always win,
but you can't burn down the system just 

52
00:02:47,341 --> 00:02:49,650
because you were on the losing end this 
time,

53
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:53,190
regardless of whether you hate or love 
trump,

54
00:02:53,490 --> 00:02:56,940
there's no doubt that something good did
come out of this election.

55
00:02:57,030 --> 00:02:59,530
People seem to be engaged in a whole new
way.

56
00:02:59,770 --> 00:03:00,603
People are talking politics,
fighting for what they believe in 

57
00:03:02,441 --> 00:03:03,274
getting involved in the conversation,
maybe even more now than when Obama ran 

58
00:03:06,731 --> 00:03:07,564
for the first time back in 2008 I think 
we're going to get a whole new crop of 

59
00:03:11,081 --> 00:03:11,914
political leaders out of this chaos and 
I hope some new political movements as 

60
00:03:15,371 --> 00:03:16,204
well as I've been saying for a year now,
if you're an old school liberal than an 

61
00:03:19,811 --> 00:03:22,480
old school,
conservative is no longer your enemy.

62
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:26,950
I really think a new center can arise 
from this and if trump is smart,

63
00:03:27,250 --> 00:03:28,083
he can actually make that happen.
Trump is a populist and that means he 

64
00:03:31,301 --> 00:03:32,134
wants to be popular.
Most of us are socially liberal and 

65
00:03:34,631 --> 00:03:35,464
fiscally conservative.
Most of us are not the alt right or the 

66
00:03:38,321 --> 00:03:41,470
regressive left.
Most of us don't care what you do in the

67
00:03:41,471 --> 00:03:42,304
privacy of your own home and we want 
government to take less instead of 

68
00:03:45,791 --> 00:03:46,624
giving more.
I think we can actually push trump 

69
00:03:48,851 --> 00:03:51,610
towards these ideals,
but if not,

70
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:54,910
then maybe we'll just have to create our
own movement to do so.

71
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:58,420
Actually,
maybe that's already begun with all this

72
00:03:58,421 --> 00:03:59,254
in mind.
I've got the perfect guest for you this 

73
00:04:01,180 --> 00:04:04,090
week.
Radio host and columnist Ben Shapiro.

74
00:04:04,420 --> 00:04:07,150
Ben Is what I would consider an old 
school conservative,

75
00:04:07,151 --> 00:04:11,650
which like me as a classical liberal is 
a strange place to be these days.

76
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:12,753
Does he fit in with the new trump led 
republican party any more than I fit in 

77
00:04:16,181 --> 00:04:18,940
with the identity politics driven 
Democratic Party?

78
00:04:19,270 --> 00:04:22,930
Not so sure.
We're both on the outside looking in and

79
00:04:22,931 --> 00:04:25,960
that's exactly where I think we can 
start building bridges.

80
00:04:26,290 --> 00:04:27,123
I was on the daily wire livestream with 
Ben on election night and I got to see 

81
00:04:30,041 --> 00:04:32,440
us.
He was alternately thrilled that Hillary

82
00:04:32,441 --> 00:04:37,441
lost but also totally dismayed that 
trump had won a couple of hours in a few

83
00:04:37,481 --> 00:04:38,314
beers later.
We both managed to survive the evening 

84
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:42,730
even if we didn't see eye to eye on the 
whole thing.

85
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:48,190
There is huge opportunity for all of us 
to shape the future of the country right

86
00:04:48,191 --> 00:04:49,024
now,
but there's no way it can change if we 

87
00:04:50,771 --> 00:04:54,310
just complain about the system instead 
of getting involved.

88
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:56,740
The rhetoric on Russia,
fake news,

89
00:04:56,741 --> 00:05:00,970
stories about fake news and outrage 
after outrage are not only going to keep

90
00:05:01,150 --> 00:05:04,150
coming but they're going to get stronger
and stronger.

91
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:05,193
The only way we'll stop them and cut 
through the noise is to figure out what 

92
00:05:08,531 --> 00:05:09,364
we believe and to fight for it.
I've got a new studio and a new 

93
00:05:12,671 --> 00:05:16,210
commitment to continue that fight and I 
hope that you'll join me.

94
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:22,350
All right,
we're back,

95
00:05:22,351 --> 00:05:24,720
baby.
Joining me this week is a radio host,

96
00:05:24,721 --> 00:05:27,330
columnist,
editor and chief of daily wire.com

97
00:05:27,331 --> 00:05:31,500
and most importantly now to Time Ruben 
Report Guest Ben Shapiro.

98
00:05:31,501 --> 00:05:32,790
Welcome back.
It is here.

99
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:34,133
I thought you would be the right guy to 
have for the first show in our new 

100
00:05:37,321 --> 00:05:38,940
studio.
I don't know what you're thinking,

101
00:05:38,941 --> 00:05:40,920
but sure.
Well,

102
00:05:40,921 --> 00:05:43,860
because a lot has happened since we last
spoke.

103
00:05:43,861 --> 00:05:44,694
Probably A,
I'd say roughly about a year ago and I 

104
00:05:47,521 --> 00:05:48,354
was with you on election night.
You had me over at the daily wire 

105
00:05:50,610 --> 00:05:53,520
studios and we had a great time and we 
had some beers.

106
00:05:53,521 --> 00:05:55,380
You were reading a lot of m and M's.
Oh yeah,

107
00:05:55,470 --> 00:05:58,250
and that sugar intake.
Now,

108
00:05:58,310 --> 00:06:02,300
the thing that I found most interesting 
was that you did not like Hillary,

109
00:06:02,630 --> 00:06:03,371
right?
Fair to say.

110
00:06:03,371 --> 00:06:04,790
Did say,
and I think she's awful.

111
00:06:04,930 --> 00:06:08,900
Not Like Hillary Clinton clearly do not 
like Donald Trump.

112
00:06:08,930 --> 00:06:09,561
Right.
So,

113
00:06:09,561 --> 00:06:10,570
so far I'm good.
Yeah,

114
00:06:10,590 --> 00:06:11,570
you're,
you're right on the money.

115
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:14,480
That's so watching you throughout that 
evening,

116
00:06:14,990 --> 00:06:17,990
the rollercoaster of emotions that you 
were going through,

117
00:06:17,991 --> 00:06:18,824
going from when I sat down,
when it's still a good for hillary to 

118
00:06:21,651 --> 00:06:25,580
then it's starting to look like trump 
then realizing it was inevitable,

119
00:06:25,581 --> 00:06:27,050
but before they called it and everything
else.

120
00:06:27,260 --> 00:06:29,550
I mean you went through every emotion 
alone.

121
00:06:30,020 --> 00:06:31,280
Bizarro world.
Yeah,

122
00:06:31,281 --> 00:06:33,720
it was definitely,
it's definitely weird because you know,

123
00:06:33,830 --> 00:06:35,540
I was,
as you know,

124
00:06:35,541 --> 00:06:36,374
I was sort of rooting for both of them 
to get left adrift in a rowboat 

125
00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:39,133
somewhere.
But unfortunately one of them was going 

126
00:06:40,281 --> 00:06:41,720
to be presidents of the United States.

127
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:43,040
So there was,
there was a bit,

128
00:06:43,041 --> 00:06:44,300
there's a lot of up and down and going 
on,

129
00:06:44,301 --> 00:06:45,134
meaning that I was overjoyed that 
Hillary was not president of the United 

130
00:06:48,140 --> 00:06:48,973
States.
Anything that kept hillary out of the 

131
00:06:49,580 --> 00:06:50,570
White House.
I was very happy about.

132
00:06:50,780 --> 00:06:52,820
And then I looked at who was actually 
entering the White House and I went,

133
00:06:52,821 --> 00:06:54,050
oh this,
I have some,

134
00:06:54,051 --> 00:06:57,170
some trepidation about not,
not sold on the,

135
00:06:57,180 --> 00:06:58,730
on this whole trump thing cause I hadn't
been,

136
00:06:58,731 --> 00:07:00,110
I didn't end up voting for either of 
them.

137
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:01,850
I left the blue at the top of the ticket
blank.

138
00:07:01,851 --> 00:07:02,684
Neither of them fulfilled my basic 
requirements to be president of the 

139
00:07:04,221 --> 00:07:06,290
United States.
So now you know,

140
00:07:06,350 --> 00:07:08,390
I was wrong about where I thought trump 
would be.

141
00:07:08,391 --> 00:07:09,224
I thought trump was going to lose just 
like everybody else who is looking at 

142
00:07:10,551 --> 00:07:13,820
the polls from nate silver to Larry 
Sabato and uh,

143
00:07:13,821 --> 00:07:16,190
and I was clearly a 100% wrong on that.

144
00:07:16,190 --> 00:07:17,023
So now I just hope that I'm wrong about 
him as a person and a president because 

145
00:07:19,941 --> 00:07:22,040
if I'm right,
then it's going to be a long four years.

146
00:07:22,490 --> 00:07:24,530
I have a feeling that no matter what 
happens,

147
00:07:24,531 --> 00:07:25,880
it's going to be a little no.
I for sure.

148
00:07:26,030 --> 00:07:26,863
Whether he does good stuff and people 
come along for the ride or whether he 

149
00:07:29,451 --> 00:07:31,250
does bad stuff and they don't get as 
good stuff,

150
00:07:31,251 --> 00:07:32,480
then I can feel good about it.
Right?

151
00:07:32,481 --> 00:07:34,070
Like I'm hoping that he does some good 
stuff.

152
00:07:34,540 --> 00:07:35,780
Yeah.
At this point you have to do.

153
00:07:35,781 --> 00:07:36,614
Right.
Even if even if you like any of his 

154
00:07:38,780 --> 00:07:39,613
positions,
he's taken over the moral center that 

155
00:07:41,541 --> 00:07:44,750
seems to do root for him as the 
president.

156
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:45,753
So I root for him to do good things.
I don't like the phrase people use this 

157
00:07:48,051 --> 00:07:50,780
with Obama also root for him.
I don't read for trump,

158
00:07:50,781 --> 00:07:51,560
I don't refer Obama.

159
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:52,393
I didn't root for Hillary.
It's not a team sport there and I like 

160
00:07:54,981 --> 00:07:56,540
the white sox and the bears and the 
Celtics.

161
00:07:56,541 --> 00:07:58,730
I root for them.
I would like to see them win.

162
00:07:58,820 --> 00:08:00,500
But in politics it's not just about 
winning,

163
00:08:00,501 --> 00:08:01,334
it's about what you do to win.
It's about the policies that you 

164
00:08:03,351 --> 00:08:06,360
implement that constitute winning.
Like how do you actually gauge winning?

165
00:08:06,361 --> 00:08:07,550
So for me,
when,

166
00:08:07,551 --> 00:08:09,980
when trump makes a bad deal,
that's good for him politically.

167
00:08:10,340 --> 00:08:12,020
That sounds something I'm in favor of.
Right?

168
00:08:12,021 --> 00:08:14,580
I'm not rooting for him,
even though it helps him politically and

169
00:08:14,670 --> 00:08:16,760
I'm rooting for him to do good things.
So I'm rooting for me.

170
00:08:16,761 --> 00:08:17,011
Right?
I'm,

171
00:08:17,011 --> 00:08:17,844
or even from the country,
I'm rooting for him to do the things 

172
00:08:19,251 --> 00:08:21,290
that will help the country more than 
makes I'm fine,

173
00:08:21,291 --> 00:08:23,720
but help that'll help the country.
Uh,

174
00:08:23,780 --> 00:08:24,613
but what I fear is that I think people 
are rooting for him or rooting against 

175
00:08:27,591 --> 00:08:28,070
him.

176
00:08:28,070 --> 00:08:30,080
And if that's your,
I sent this on my podcast today.

177
00:08:30,081 --> 00:08:30,914
If,
if your moral center is basically good 

178
00:08:32,961 --> 00:08:35,390
for trump,
is good for the country or bad for trump

179
00:08:35,420 --> 00:08:37,670
is good for the country,
you need a different moral center.

180
00:08:38,090 --> 00:08:40,550
So that seems to be the place that we're
at right now.

181
00:08:40,551 --> 00:08:42,860
We're trump said I'm going to win.
I'm a winner.

182
00:08:43,070 --> 00:08:47,510
And that that force of will was almost 
enough in and of itself,

183
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:49,170
an amazing bank,
Hema winter.

184
00:08:49,190 --> 00:08:51,710
So he's your version of winning,
which would be,

185
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:52,641
uh,
you know,

186
00:08:52,641 --> 00:08:54,430
having certain,
uh,

187
00:08:55,530 --> 00:08:57,180
ethical code,
whatever,

188
00:08:57,181 --> 00:08:59,310
whether we agree on all,
every little policy is irrelevant.

189
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:03,280
But can you win on that anymore?
Now that we've seen how trump won.

190
00:09:03,580 --> 00:09:04,413
Do you honestly think that a 
conservative can when you playing the 

191
00:09:07,741 --> 00:09:10,740
game that's out there?
I do think that,

192
00:09:10,741 --> 00:09:12,660
I think that some of the things that 
trump did,

193
00:09:12,661 --> 00:09:16,110
and I said this very early on,
I mean very early before he started kind

194
00:09:16,111 --> 00:09:18,210
of making an ass of himself repeatedly.

195
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:19,193
I said that actually there was a good 
shot that he would be a better nominee 

196
00:09:21,121 --> 00:09:21,954
in terms of winning than Marco Rubio 
because I thought that he spoke a moral 

197
00:09:24,211 --> 00:09:25,044
language about politics.
A lot of the other candidates didn't 

198
00:09:26,340 --> 00:09:29,040
mean he can go look back at my speech,
I gave it University of Missouri in like

199
00:09:29,041 --> 00:09:29,874
October,
2015 and I said the trump might be 

200
00:09:31,321 --> 00:09:32,154
stronger,
especially among blue collar whites in 

201
00:09:34,021 --> 00:09:35,910
states like Wisconsin,
Pennsylvania and Michigan.

202
00:09:35,911 --> 00:09:37,770
So I got it right then.
I got it wrong and your later right.

203
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:38,521
Um,
but,

204
00:09:38,521 --> 00:09:39,354
but the,
but the idea there is that trump speaks 

205
00:09:41,011 --> 00:09:42,270
in terms of mortality.
He,

206
00:09:42,271 --> 00:09:43,104
there are good guys and bad guys,
whether you agree with his mortalities 

207
00:09:45,141 --> 00:09:46,470
and other things,
but for politics,

208
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:47,333
for him,
all politics breaks down into good guys 

209
00:09:48,661 --> 00:09:50,070
versus bad guys.
Unfortunately,

210
00:09:50,071 --> 00:09:53,820
very often it's just I'm the good guy.
Everybody who opposes me is the bad guy.

211
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:55,620
But that's a way that people think about
politics.

212
00:09:55,740 --> 00:09:59,010
And I think that if you had the actual 
proper moral,

213
00:09:59,330 --> 00:10:01,320
you know,
content to that sort of narrative,

214
00:10:01,590 --> 00:10:03,600
then yeah,
you could still win based on that.

215
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:07,140
It's so funny that everybody sort of,
because everybody's a binary thinker.

216
00:10:07,210 --> 00:10:09,250
Uh,
everybody broke it down into a,

217
00:10:09,270 --> 00:10:11,490
trump is the only one who can campaign 
aggressively.

218
00:10:11,491 --> 00:10:13,200
He's the only one who can speak this 
moral language.

219
00:10:13,470 --> 00:10:14,303
Now,
I wasn't against trump campaigning 

220
00:10:15,151 --> 00:10:16,770
aggressively or speaking this moral 
language.

221
00:10:16,771 --> 00:10:18,360
I just thought that he was applying it 
incorrectly.

222
00:10:18,420 --> 00:10:19,440
I mean,
if you watch me into Bain,

223
00:10:19,441 --> 00:10:22,440
I'm constantly applying moral language.
I'm constantly aggressive,

224
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:24,060
but I disagreed with trump.
You can,

225
00:10:24,061 --> 00:10:29,061
you can do both at the same time.
So are we at a point then of post truth?

226
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:31,530
Because if you look at what he says now,
again,

227
00:10:31,830 --> 00:10:34,710
most of the criticism I get right now is
that I'm being too kind to him.

228
00:10:35,050 --> 00:10:35,883
Yeah.
I've been saying for weeks now we have 

229
00:10:36,721 --> 00:10:37,554
to see what happens.
I can't get outraged about appointments 

230
00:10:39,631 --> 00:10:41,430
yet.
I have to wait to see,

231
00:10:41,460 --> 00:10:43,690
you know,
you can get a sense of what's going on.

232
00:10:43,710 --> 00:10:44,131
Know.
That's right.

233
00:10:44,131 --> 00:10:45,630
I'm not allowed to see what happens,
but I think that's right.

234
00:10:45,631 --> 00:10:47,280
I'm not,
I'm not outraged about the appointments.

235
00:10:47,340 --> 00:10:49,710
Um,
you know what he does and what he says.

236
00:10:49,711 --> 00:10:50,544
I can be outraged by it.
And I think that there's an incentive 

237
00:10:52,051 --> 00:10:54,210
structure that has to exist or if he 
does something bad now,

238
00:10:54,211 --> 00:10:55,044
now I criticized him.
The argument was made during the 

239
00:10:55,981 --> 00:10:57,840
election cycle for people on the right.
Well,

240
00:10:57,841 --> 00:10:59,310
if he says something bad,
Shh,

241
00:10:59,340 --> 00:11:00,810
be quiet.
Hillary might get elected.

242
00:11:00,870 --> 00:11:02,250
Right.
And my view was,

243
00:11:02,251 --> 00:11:03,870
that's not my job.
My job is to,

244
00:11:03,940 --> 00:11:06,690
is as somebody who actually believes in 
something that's truthful.

245
00:11:06,780 --> 00:11:09,900
My job is to say what I think is true,
whether he's saying it or not,

246
00:11:09,930 --> 00:11:12,000
but now,
especially post election,

247
00:11:12,001 --> 00:11:13,110
Hillary is no longer in the picture.

248
00:11:13,110 --> 00:11:15,810
So the question now is if he does 
something that's false,

249
00:11:15,990 --> 00:11:18,840
are you going to call that out?
Even if you're a politically on his side

250
00:11:18,841 --> 00:11:20,160
overall.
And that's,

251
00:11:20,161 --> 00:11:22,020
that's the real question for me.
So my job,

252
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:24,330
I still is the same as it ever was.
When he does something good,

253
00:11:24,331 --> 00:11:25,860
I praise him when he does something bad,
I don't,

254
00:11:26,460 --> 00:11:29,230
which really is not what many people,
people don't want that.

255
00:11:29,260 --> 00:11:29,820
Now people,
people,

256
00:11:29,820 --> 00:11:30,451
people,
I mean,

257
00:11:30,451 --> 00:11:31,370
it's fine.
Do they not want it?

258
00:11:31,390 --> 00:11:33,420
Because I suspect they wanted,
it's what I'm trying to do.

259
00:11:33,421 --> 00:11:35,700
I know it hasn't,
it hasn't hurt me,

260
00:11:35,870 --> 00:11:36,500
you know,
with,

261
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:39,300
I think with most people,
most people are refreshed when they hear

262
00:11:39,301 --> 00:11:41,910
somebody like you or like me say,
okay,

263
00:11:41,911 --> 00:11:43,170
here's the truth.
You know,

264
00:11:43,171 --> 00:11:44,004
and I'm putting my own political 
interests aside and the interest of the 

265
00:11:46,021 --> 00:11:47,700
person who's at risk here.

266
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:48,990
Uh,
then here's,

267
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,400
here's what's true and here's what's 
not.

268
00:11:50,610 --> 00:11:51,443
But there's a large contingent that's 
going to resist that in a major way 

269
00:11:53,471 --> 00:11:54,251
because it,
again,

270
00:11:54,251 --> 00:11:56,560
it has become such a team sport.
It has become,

271
00:11:56,770 --> 00:11:58,270
well,
if you say something bad about trump,

272
00:11:58,271 --> 00:12:00,400
then you're a cock and you're in,
you're undermining him.

273
00:12:00,401 --> 00:12:00,910
And it's like,
well,

274
00:12:00,910 --> 00:12:01,870
again,
that's a,

275
00:12:01,900 --> 00:12:03,100
Bill O'reilly said there about George 
will,

276
00:12:03,101 --> 00:12:05,830
George will criticize the carrier deal,
and Riley comes out and he says,

277
00:12:05,980 --> 00:12:07,030
George,
will's just undermining.

278
00:12:07,031 --> 00:12:08,140
Trump said,
wait a second.

279
00:12:08,141 --> 00:12:10,340
He's not my dictator.
He's my server.

280
00:12:10,780 --> 00:12:12,040
It's not right.
It's not the opposite.

281
00:12:12,070 --> 00:12:13,390
I'm not his servant.
He's my servant.

282
00:12:13,391 --> 00:12:14,224
He's a public servant.
Now I know that he's been in private 

283
00:12:15,551 --> 00:12:17,740
business his whole life,
but he was running for the job of public

284
00:12:17,741 --> 00:12:18,574
servant.
Now it's his job to serve the interest 

285
00:12:19,661 --> 00:12:20,494
of the American people.
It's not my job to serve as his 

286
00:12:22,151 --> 00:12:23,260
political interests.
Yeah.

287
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:24,101
And so,
you know,

288
00:12:24,101 --> 00:12:24,934
it's,
it's been very weird to watch people 

289
00:12:25,931 --> 00:12:27,550
kind of invert that.
Uh,

290
00:12:27,650 --> 00:12:29,230
and I thought that that was unique to 
the left.

291
00:12:29,231 --> 00:12:30,064
So I've,
I've been disabused of that pretty 

292
00:12:30,791 --> 00:12:31,340
radically.
Yeah.

293
00:12:31,340 --> 00:12:32,021
Yeah.
So that,

294
00:12:32,021 --> 00:12:33,560
that's really interesting.
And maybe,

295
00:12:33,590 --> 00:12:35,230
maybe my,
uh,

296
00:12:35,300 --> 00:12:36,133
feelings about what's happening with the
left just kicked in a little bit more a 

297
00:12:39,411 --> 00:12:41,630
little earlier than yours have kicked in
about the right thing.

298
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:44,300
And that's true because you are seeing 
this and it's pretty obvious.

299
00:12:44,510 --> 00:12:45,343
I mean to me the issue will be that once
these trump people who have been 

300
00:12:47,991 --> 00:12:48,860
offered,
you know,

301
00:12:48,861 --> 00:12:49,694
against political correctness and free 
speech and all of this stuff and say 

302
00:12:52,431 --> 00:12:54,580
what you're feeling about about which 
I'm for all of them,

303
00:12:55,310 --> 00:12:57,530
but once on January 20th,
once,

304
00:12:57,531 --> 00:13:01,820
those are the guys that are in power,
will they be as uh,

305
00:13:01,910 --> 00:13:03,260
for fighting the power?

306
00:13:03,410 --> 00:13:04,800
No.
Somehow suspect.

307
00:13:04,810 --> 00:13:05,281
No,
no.

308
00:13:05,281 --> 00:13:06,750
I mean Kellyanne Conway today,
right?

309
00:13:06,751 --> 00:13:09,770
I mean Kellyanne Conway was out there 
criticizing a,

310
00:13:09,790 --> 00:13:11,700
I think it was a bret Stevens from the 
Wall Street Journal.

311
00:13:11,701 --> 00:13:12,534
Bret Stevens from the Wall Street 
Journal was making fun of Carly Fiorina 

312
00:13:14,041 --> 00:13:14,874
cause she went to trump tower and he 
says like five minutes ago you were 

313
00:13:16,861 --> 00:13:19,530
saying it was the worst person who ever 
was and he was making fun your face.

314
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:20,513
And now here you are at trump tower and 
Kellyanne conway tweets back at Bret 

315
00:13:23,700 --> 00:13:25,680
Stephens and she said something like,
that's really sexist.

316
00:13:25,681 --> 00:13:27,420
What do you think?
And then she tags Rupert Murdoch,

317
00:13:27,450 --> 00:13:28,710
right?
Who owns the Wall Street Journal,

318
00:13:28,730 --> 00:13:29,563
right?
And so is this the way that this is 

319
00:13:30,391 --> 00:13:32,970
going to go now that we're going to go 
to the bosses of the people who we don't

320
00:13:32,971 --> 00:13:33,690
like what they're saying,

321
00:13:33,690 --> 00:13:35,670
right.
That's someone literally in the incoming

322
00:13:35,671 --> 00:13:37,740
administration tagging someone.
Yeah.

323
00:13:37,820 --> 00:13:39,380
Let me,
Sean Hannity did the same thing today.

324
00:13:39,381 --> 00:13:42,020
Somebody red state criticized him,
didn't like something that he did.

325
00:13:42,140 --> 00:13:44,010
So he immediately tagged the heads of 
sales.

326
00:13:44,011 --> 00:13:45,050
The communications.
It's tones,

327
00:13:45,051 --> 00:13:45,884
red state.
I mean like is this something that we 

328
00:13:47,121 --> 00:13:48,310
want to engage in?
I,

329
00:13:48,350 --> 00:13:49,183
this is,
this is not like I disagree with people 

330
00:13:50,961 --> 00:13:51,794
all the time.
I generally don't call for them to be 

331
00:13:53,781 --> 00:13:54,614
fired.
Right?

332
00:13:54,620 --> 00:13:56,690
I mean that's it.
That's it.

333
00:13:56,840 --> 00:13:59,930
Sometimes like there was a point where I
suggested that there there should be,

334
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:01,340
if someone,
if they've left us,

335
00:14:01,341 --> 00:14:02,174
we're going to apply certain tactics.
Then you have to apply those same 

336
00:14:03,711 --> 00:14:04,544
tactics to people on the left in order 
to create a sort of mutually assured 

337
00:14:06,711 --> 00:14:09,320
destruction.
But that's not what's going on now.

338
00:14:09,321 --> 00:14:10,154
Now what's going on?
As you criticized certain people and 

339
00:14:11,571 --> 00:14:12,404
those people just say,
you ought to be fired just for the 

340
00:14:13,011 --> 00:14:13,850
criticism.
In fact,

341
00:14:13,851 --> 00:14:17,270
I've never blocked anyone on twitter.
I don't mute anybody on twitter.

342
00:14:17,330 --> 00:14:18,163
So all of the,
all the evil terrible tweets that I 

343
00:14:19,221 --> 00:14:20,054
received,
I've never called for anybody to be 

344
00:14:20,751 --> 00:14:22,310
banned from twitter,
even though you know,

345
00:14:22,311 --> 00:14:23,330
I was,
according to the Adl,

346
00:14:23,331 --> 00:14:26,160
the number one recipient of antisemitism
or one line this year.

347
00:14:26,430 --> 00:14:27,620
So I mean it did,
but I've never,

348
00:14:27,621 --> 00:14:30,440
but that's not my thing.
But watching people on my own side do it

349
00:14:30,441 --> 00:14:30,981
now,
it's like,

350
00:14:30,981 --> 00:14:32,540
well,
you should shut up because,

351
00:14:32,541 --> 00:14:33,440
because trump,
no,

352
00:14:33,470 --> 00:14:34,281
no,
sorry.

353
00:14:34,281 --> 00:14:35,114
That's not the way it works.

354
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:37,970
Yeah.
Can you win that battle?

355
00:14:38,350 --> 00:14:38,990
I mean,
yeah,

356
00:14:38,990 --> 00:14:39,823
I think you're right.

357
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:41,780
Exactly.
I mean,

358
00:14:41,781 --> 00:14:43,190
as you know,
you wouldn't be in this business.

359
00:14:43,191 --> 00:14:46,010
I wouldn't be in this business if I 
didn't think the battle we're winnable.

360
00:14:46,420 --> 00:14:50,510
I think that in the afterglow of a,
of an election,

361
00:14:50,511 --> 00:14:53,670
it's very for people to get past the 
team sport of it and the,

362
00:14:53,671 --> 00:14:56,420
the warm feeling and the excitement.
So I immediately,

363
00:14:56,421 --> 00:14:57,560
I mean,
as you mentioned that night,

364
00:14:57,680 --> 00:14:58,513
I kept going from excitement and 
trepidation and excitement and 

365
00:15:00,141 --> 00:15:01,310
trepidation to,
oh my God,

366
00:15:01,311 --> 00:15:03,150
I can't believe this was the election.
And,

367
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:04,760
but a lot of people just went straight 
to,

368
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,850
we hate Hillary Clinton so much.
Everything is now hunky Dory.

369
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:10,250
No problems anymore.
Trump's here,

370
00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:11,113
I alone can solve.
And I think that'll last up until the 

371
00:15:14,091 --> 00:15:16,460
point where the pedal hits the metal and
then we'll see.

372
00:15:16,570 --> 00:15:17,260
Yeah.

373
00:15:17,260 --> 00:15:18,093
What kind of policies he actually 
implements and whether people are 

374
00:15:19,391 --> 00:15:20,224
willing to stand up my bed is that a lot
fewer people will be willing to stand 

375
00:15:22,991 --> 00:15:23,820
up,
uh,

376
00:15:23,820 --> 00:15:24,653
and,
and not back in when he does bad things 

377
00:15:26,411 --> 00:15:28,120
then,
then you would have thought a year ago.

378
00:15:28,210 --> 00:15:29,950
Yeah,
I guess we shall see.

379
00:15:30,250 --> 00:15:32,350
Um,
what,

380
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:33,910
what's next?
What?

381
00:15:33,940 --> 00:15:35,260
Okay.
So he becomes president,

382
00:15:35,650 --> 00:15:39,820
he starts doing whatever he's doing the 
left automatically,

383
00:15:39,850 --> 00:15:40,683
and this has been my funeral along is if
you demonize someone to the point where 

384
00:15:43,901 --> 00:15:46,360
even if they do good,
you have to keep demonizing them because

385
00:15:46,361 --> 00:15:50,020
if he's a racist bigot,
even if even if it reads to speak,

386
00:15:50,021 --> 00:15:52,750
it does good things for the economy.
Well you can't be nice to him,

387
00:15:52,751 --> 00:15:53,584
right?
Because he's,

388
00:15:53,590 --> 00:15:56,590
he's the scum of the earth.
What happens after this?

389
00:15:56,591 --> 00:15:57,424
Because it seems to me that I think 
we're going to start seeing more of a 

390
00:15:59,801 --> 00:16:04,180
trend of violence and you know,
the state coming down on more violence,

391
00:16:04,181 --> 00:16:07,480
like it just seems like this is where 
this has all been led up to and he's the

392
00:16:07,481 --> 00:16:09,250
guy to to lead the fight against.

393
00:16:09,940 --> 00:16:10,211
Well,
I mean,

394
00:16:10,211 --> 00:16:13,050
the level of radicalism that's emerged 
on both sides in terms of the,

395
00:16:13,051 --> 00:16:13,884
the wild and tolerance for people with 
different political opinions is pretty 

396
00:16:16,901 --> 00:16:18,260
extreme as you're saying.
Ah,

397
00:16:18,261 --> 00:16:20,260
you know,
I think that if Democrats were smart,

398
00:16:20,290 --> 00:16:22,120
they would actually see this as kind of 
an opportunity.

399
00:16:22,170 --> 00:16:24,160
Do that.
My guess is that trump's gonna govern as

400
00:16:24,161 --> 00:16:24,994
as more of a centrist Democrat.
Then he has is a hardcore right wing 

401
00:16:26,561 --> 00:16:27,394
Republican.
I mean he's talking about trillion 

402
00:16:28,030 --> 00:16:28,863
dollar infrastructure packages and he's 
talking about tariffs and he's talking 

403
00:16:31,391 --> 00:16:32,980
about a lot of Bernie sanders kind of 
policies.

404
00:16:32,981 --> 00:16:34,130
He's a populist,
right?

405
00:16:34,490 --> 00:16:35,830
That's right.
And so you could win.

406
00:16:35,831 --> 00:16:36,664
So what you could see Democrats is doing
is doing exactly what they did to 

407
00:16:38,741 --> 00:16:39,890
Herbert Hoover.
If it,

408
00:16:39,891 --> 00:16:41,140
let's say if things go bad,
right?

409
00:16:41,141 --> 00:16:41,974
Let's see if things go well,
he'll be reelected because of president 

410
00:16:43,540 --> 00:16:44,110
who's president.

411
00:16:44,110 --> 00:16:45,820
When things are going well,
generally is reelected.

412
00:16:45,830 --> 00:16:47,470
But let's say things.
Let's say for the sake of argument,

413
00:16:47,471 --> 00:16:50,350
things don't go well.
Let's say that just as as every eight to

414
00:16:50,351 --> 00:16:52,660
10 years for the last several decades in
this country,

415
00:16:52,661 --> 00:16:55,660
there's some sort of recession and 
Democrats blame trump for it.

416
00:16:56,110 --> 00:16:56,943
What they could do is they could 
campaign on triple tripling down on the 

417
00:17:00,251 --> 00:17:01,031
populism,
right?

418
00:17:01,031 --> 00:17:02,740
I mean they actually have that opening 
now,

419
00:17:03,370 --> 00:17:06,250
whereas they didn't before and they 
could actually do Fdr to hoover.

420
00:17:06,251 --> 00:17:07,150
They could say,
you know,

421
00:17:07,151 --> 00:17:07,984
hoover kind of implemented a lot of soft
fdr policies and then fdr came in and 

422
00:17:10,841 --> 00:17:13,150
tripled down on everything and get 
selected four straight times.

423
00:17:13,300 --> 00:17:14,133
You could see Democrats doing this 
things shift really quickly in the 

424
00:17:16,061 --> 00:17:16,894
country.
And Hillary did win by about 3 million 

425
00:17:17,861 --> 00:17:19,850
popular votes.
So this isn't quite the,

426
00:17:19,851 --> 00:17:22,810
the massive majority that Republicans 
are banking on.

427
00:17:23,050 --> 00:17:25,960
Um,
but I do think that if their,

428
00:17:25,990 --> 00:17:28,570
if their rhetoric is this extreme,
you know,

429
00:17:28,571 --> 00:17:31,570
during the campaign the question is 
going to be whether they ratcheted up or

430
00:17:31,571 --> 00:17:34,810
whether they sort of ratcheted down and 
wait to see what happens.

431
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:36,840
I'm seeing some of both.
I'm seeing some about that.

432
00:17:36,870 --> 00:17:38,500
And so yeah,
because I hope you're right.

433
00:17:38,610 --> 00:17:40,300
Like Harry Reid for example,
came out and he says,

434
00:17:40,420 --> 00:17:41,253
so far trump's not not that bad,
which is something that should make 

435
00:17:44,021 --> 00:17:44,854
conservatives a little concerned.
But Harry Reid says that you could see 

436
00:17:47,141 --> 00:17:48,970
Democrats move in that direction.
He's not that.

437
00:17:49,170 --> 00:17:50,150
And then things collapse.
Oh,

438
00:17:50,170 --> 00:17:51,480
told you he was that bad.
Right.

439
00:17:51,870 --> 00:17:52,703
But the other,
cause they want to get some liberal 

440
00:17:53,641 --> 00:17:55,230
policy items from a lefty policy out of 
it.

441
00:17:55,740 --> 00:17:56,573
But on the other hand,
what's going on in university campuses 

442
00:17:58,411 --> 00:18:00,540
and the,
and the sort of extreme response,

443
00:18:00,890 --> 00:18:01,723
uh,
that I think is going to get a lot 

444
00:18:02,461 --> 00:18:03,294
worse.
I think Democrats in government will 

445
00:18:04,351 --> 00:18:05,184
likely treat him with more moderation 
after the election than they did before 

446
00:18:07,801 --> 00:18:09,480
the election.
Because that's sort of been the pattern.

447
00:18:10,020 --> 00:18:13,300
But the typical public is going to treat
this is like we're,

448
00:18:13,310 --> 00:18:15,360
we're now in an end of times 
politicking.

449
00:18:15,530 --> 00:18:16,460
Right?
So I guess that,

450
00:18:16,461 --> 00:18:18,950
so that's an interesting distinction 
that the sort of leadership,

451
00:18:18,951 --> 00:18:21,170
whether it's the media or the political 
leadership,

452
00:18:21,410 --> 00:18:23,240
may be willing to work with them in a 
certain way.

453
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:24,313
What they've ginned up something yes.
In the populous that they may be can't 

454
00:18:27,531 --> 00:18:28,090
control.

455
00:18:28,090 --> 00:18:28,923
Exactly.
And actually you're seeing that battle 

456
00:18:29,531 --> 00:18:30,880
play out in the Democratic Party right 
now.

457
00:18:30,881 --> 00:18:31,714
You've got the people who want to double
down and all the kind of identity 

458
00:18:33,461 --> 00:18:34,930
politics,
rhetoric like Keith Ellison,

459
00:18:35,320 --> 00:18:36,153
right?
He's going to double down on that and 

460
00:18:36,791 --> 00:18:38,170
he's going to keep saying racist,
sexist,

461
00:18:38,171 --> 00:18:39,004
bigot.
Homophobe let's get our coalition 

462
00:18:39,911 --> 00:18:40,744
Together.
The Obama coalition will run somebody 

463
00:18:41,971 --> 00:18:44,450
who's not an old white lady.
Next time we'll run cory booker,

464
00:18:44,470 --> 00:18:45,303
Kamala Harris,
and then we'll just sweep back to 

465
00:18:46,001 --> 00:18:49,060
victory using this new coalition that's 
demographically growing.

466
00:18:49,270 --> 00:18:50,103
And then you've got people like Joe 
Biden and some of the old guard 

467
00:18:52,810 --> 00:18:54,280
Democrats who are saying,
well,

468
00:18:54,340 --> 00:18:56,200
hold on just a second.
Like we can actually,

469
00:18:56,201 --> 00:18:57,034
why are we abandoning all of these,
these blue collar white voters who are 

470
00:18:59,261 --> 00:19:01,780
voting for us until very recently,
right?

471
00:19:01,781 --> 00:19:03,700
A lot of these counties went for Obama 
the first time.

472
00:19:04,260 --> 00:19:05,093
And why don't we,
why don't we try to draw them in by 

473
00:19:07,481 --> 00:19:09,730
maybe working with trump and then if he,
and then,

474
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:10,833
and then hitting him when we think that 
he's over overly selling something or 

475
00:19:13,751 --> 00:19:15,580
hitting him when things go bad and so 
that,

476
00:19:15,581 --> 00:19:17,710
that conflict will really play out at 
the DNC level.

477
00:19:18,010 --> 00:19:18,640
Uh,
and that's,

478
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:19,473
that's a fascinating,

479
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:20,310
yeah.
I mean,

480
00:19:20,310 --> 00:19:21,143
I would bet everything that they're 
going to go the Bernie Ellis and rooms 

481
00:19:24,380 --> 00:19:25,213
dump everybody else.
Do you think there's any room for those 

482
00:19:26,641 --> 00:19:28,890
people that you know for a gym where 
Biden,

483
00:19:29,850 --> 00:19:31,260
those happened to be two older white 
guys,

484
00:19:31,261 --> 00:19:32,094
but he's been anyone in that general 
line of thinking blue dog Democrat is 

485
00:19:34,171 --> 00:19:34,690
that right

486
00:19:34,690 --> 00:19:35,700
now Jim Webb,
right.

487
00:19:35,710 --> 00:19:36,543
I think Jim Webb's toast biden still 
tries to straddle that gap a little bit 

488
00:19:40,030 --> 00:19:42,190
and he gets away with it cause he's part
of the Obama administration.

489
00:19:42,290 --> 00:19:43,840
Yeah,
but it's,

490
00:19:43,841 --> 00:19:44,674
yeah,
I think they're going to be gradually 

491
00:19:45,371 --> 00:19:46,204
drag to the left cause again in our 
entire life the left has been gradually 

492
00:19:49,331 --> 00:19:50,164
drag further and further to the left and
I'm waiting to see the moderates since 

493
00:19:52,331 --> 00:19:52,870
Clinton.
They've been,

494
00:19:52,870 --> 00:19:53,010
yeah,

495
00:19:53,010 --> 00:19:53,843
that's the thing.
I think for a long time that the right 

496
00:19:54,931 --> 00:19:56,430
got dragged further in front of the 
right.

497
00:19:56,431 --> 00:19:58,650
But this election,
clearly they weren't.

498
00:19:58,680 --> 00:19:59,221
No,
they weren't.

499
00:19:59,221 --> 00:20:00,570
They were dragged the left actually 
pretty hard.

500
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:01,860
They weren't,
I mean trump doesn't,

501
00:20:01,861 --> 00:20:03,840
it's obvious he doesn't care about gay 
marriage,

502
00:20:03,841 --> 00:20:04,674
I don't think.
No,

503
00:20:04,890 --> 00:20:08,100
I don't think he cares about abortion,
cares about weed.

504
00:20:08,101 --> 00:20:11,130
I think even some of the tax stuff I 
think is going to be a little more,

505
00:20:11,131 --> 00:20:13,020
you write the ending,
at least centrist Democrat,

506
00:20:13,021 --> 00:20:14,670
I think he's going to govern a lot more 
like Bill Clinton.

507
00:20:14,671 --> 00:20:16,080
Then he,
then he would govern like Ronald Reagan.

508
00:20:16,081 --> 00:20:16,914
That's the danger though.
If you demonize somebody to that end 

509
00:20:18,461 --> 00:20:19,294
point and then even if they are with you
on so many of the things that you've 

510
00:20:21,031 --> 00:20:23,340
been screaming about for so long,
you're,

511
00:20:23,341 --> 00:20:24,330
you've painted yourself into that.

512
00:20:24,590 --> 00:20:25,190
Yeah,
I think,

513
00:20:25,190 --> 00:20:26,023
I think that's right and I think the 
Democrats have painted themselves in a 

514
00:20:27,771 --> 00:20:28,604
little bit of a corner except that 
they're just banking on the growth of 

515
00:20:31,251 --> 00:20:32,084
the Obama coalition.
They keep looking at the demographic 

516
00:20:33,051 --> 00:20:33,740
numbers.
Yeah,

517
00:20:33,740 --> 00:20:34,551
and they keep thinking,
okay,

518
00:20:34,551 --> 00:20:38,720
in 2020 40% of all voters will be of the
millennial generation.

519
00:20:38,870 --> 00:20:39,703
Those people broke heavily for hilary,
so what's to stop us now and 

520
00:20:43,130 --> 00:20:45,680
demographics are not quite destinee.
I mean demographic.

521
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:47,990
What a sad way

522
00:20:47,990 --> 00:20:48,823
that would be to live as a society that 
we would only be following the 

523
00:20:51,851 --> 00:20:53,550
demographic trend,
but that's what we are right now.

524
00:20:54,010 --> 00:20:55,750
We've moved in such a tribal direction 
too.

525
00:20:55,751 --> 00:20:56,584
I mean it's easy to look at this 
election cycle and look at did he went 

526
00:20:58,451 --> 00:20:59,284
on policy?
I don't think that the trump one on 

527
00:21:00,101 --> 00:21:04,840
policy so much as rejection of tribalism
in favor of another sort of tribalism.

528
00:21:04,841 --> 00:21:05,674
Like if you look at how blue collar 
white voters voted in this election 

529
00:21:08,381 --> 00:21:13,120
cycle by percentage white,
we're a white working class.

530
00:21:13,330 --> 00:21:14,163
People voted more for trump than 
Hispanics voted for Hillary Clinton and 

531
00:21:17,351 --> 00:21:18,184
people are constantly talking about the,
the idea that Hispanics are voting 

532
00:21:20,621 --> 00:21:21,131
block.
Okay,

533
00:21:21,131 --> 00:21:21,964
well then so are white blue collar 
people presumably and they voted 

534
00:21:24,430 --> 00:21:26,860
precisely the reverse.
They will be 71% for trump.

535
00:21:27,100 --> 00:21:28,630
That's it.
Again,

536
00:21:28,631 --> 00:21:30,310
I don't have a problem with people with 
any group voting,

537
00:21:30,311 --> 00:21:32,040
however they want to vote,
but if,

538
00:21:32,060 --> 00:21:33,880
if it starts to look like a voting 
block,

539
00:21:33,881 --> 00:21:35,680
like our group interest,
solidarity,

540
00:21:35,681 --> 00:21:37,240
I don't think that's,
that's totally what's happening,

541
00:21:37,241 --> 00:21:38,920
I don't think is a bunch of white people
getting together and going,

542
00:21:39,070 --> 00:21:40,180
oh,
we've got to vote against this black and

543
00:21:40,181 --> 00:21:40,980
Hispanic people.

544
00:21:40,980 --> 00:21:41,771
Right.
Just like,

545
00:21:41,771 --> 00:21:43,660
I don't think that it's all Hispanic 
people getting together.

546
00:21:43,661 --> 00:21:44,920
We need to vote against the white 
people,

547
00:21:45,100 --> 00:21:46,760
but it,
but there is that,

548
00:21:46,761 --> 00:21:49,890
that growing sense that you're going to 
vote inside your own block and it,

549
00:21:49,891 --> 00:21:50,724
and that is not a good thing.
Do you think that's actually real 

550
00:21:52,841 --> 00:21:53,674
though?
Because every time I watched John King 

551
00:21:54,641 --> 00:21:55,474
with the Magic Wall that I'm pretty sure
he's having an affair with commercial 

552
00:21:58,151 --> 00:21:58,984
breaks,
but every time I watch them do that and 

553
00:21:59,741 --> 00:21:59,981
said,
well,

554
00:21:59,981 --> 00:22:00,814
the white working class people here in 
the black people here in the Latino 

555
00:22:02,591 --> 00:22:04,270
people here in this whole thing.
And it's like,

556
00:22:04,330 --> 00:22:07,780
not only does that actually sort of 
sound racist and I don't know,

557
00:22:07,781 --> 00:22:10,930
it doesn't mean it's actually just 
pinning everyone by these,

558
00:22:10,990 --> 00:22:12,620
these traits.
Uh,

559
00:22:12,670 --> 00:22:16,060
but it also doesn't sound logical.
I don't think,

560
00:22:16,300 --> 00:22:17,133
and maybe I'm really wrong here,
but I don't think most people vote on 

561
00:22:20,020 --> 00:22:22,390
the color of their skin or no,
I don't think so either.

562
00:22:22,390 --> 00:22:23,950
But I think that they vote like their 
neighbors vote.

563
00:22:24,130 --> 00:22:24,963
And so and so if they see that their 
neighbors are voting a certain way and 

564
00:22:27,131 --> 00:22:29,860
there's a certain revenge politics to 
everything,

565
00:22:30,100 --> 00:22:33,430
and this is not unique to one group,
it's like the system has screwed us.

566
00:22:33,770 --> 00:22:36,580
This is the system has screwed us is one
of the ways that politics dies,

567
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:38,980
that that notion,
the system has screwed us.

568
00:22:39,130 --> 00:22:40,420
And I don't just mean like the 
government,

569
00:22:40,421 --> 00:22:43,510
if you can show that the government is 
specifically disadvantage in your group,

570
00:22:43,750 --> 00:22:45,880
that's one thing.
But when you just say the system broadly

571
00:22:46,180 --> 00:22:49,480
is screwing us and it's to us as white,
blue collar workers,

572
00:22:49,570 --> 00:22:52,450
or it's us as black people or it's us as
Hispanics,

573
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:54,460
that's a really damaging thing.
And,

574
00:22:54,470 --> 00:22:57,550
and that I think is,
is rising pretty dramatically.

575
00:22:58,210 --> 00:22:59,043
And,
and that's partially because the only 

576
00:23:01,451 --> 00:23:02,284
way that politics operates,
and I've spoken about this at length 

577
00:23:04,211 --> 00:23:05,270
recently,
uh,

578
00:23:05,320 --> 00:23:06,153
but the,
the only way that politics actually 

579
00:23:06,971 --> 00:23:10,090
operates and the way society operates is
through building of the social fabric.

580
00:23:10,090 --> 00:23:10,923
The idea that we are individuals who are
going to treat each other as 

581
00:23:12,191 --> 00:23:13,024
individuals.
We're not going to treat each other as 

582
00:23:13,571 --> 00:23:14,404
members of groups will have to spend so 
long breaking people down into identity 

583
00:23:16,691 --> 00:23:19,660
group politics that the Wright responded
with it's own form of,

584
00:23:19,661 --> 00:23:20,560
okay,
well screw you,

585
00:23:20,561 --> 00:23:21,101
we're,
you know,

586
00:23:21,101 --> 00:23:22,990
you've already boxed us in.
So okay,

587
00:23:22,991 --> 00:23:24,310
now that we're in the box,
we're in the box.

588
00:23:24,311 --> 00:23:25,230
Like that's what it is.
Right?

589
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:27,310
It's almost like they're,
they hated it for so long,

590
00:23:27,311 --> 00:23:29,160
but now they're embracing it.
You sleep.

591
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:31,480
Right.
I've tried so hard to have the left back

592
00:23:31,481 --> 00:23:32,710
away from some of this stuff.
Yeah,

593
00:23:32,711 --> 00:23:33,730
exactly.
Exactly.

594
00:23:33,731 --> 00:23:35,890
And I'd like to see the right back away 
from some of this stuff.

595
00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:36,873
I think that's what a lot of the 
outright controversy was about because 

596
00:23:38,981 --> 00:23:41,200
they're really open about the tribalism.
But I mean,

597
00:23:41,201 --> 00:23:43,330
there's no question that,
that some of what trump was doing was,

598
00:23:43,331 --> 00:23:44,740
it was a quasi tribal appeal.

599
00:23:44,740 --> 00:23:45,321
Right?
I mean when,

600
00:23:45,321 --> 00:23:47,390
when he was talking about tariffs,
for example,

601
00:23:47,660 --> 00:23:48,980
the terrorists that he's talking about,
you know,

602
00:23:48,981 --> 00:23:49,341
he,
he,

603
00:23:49,341 --> 00:23:50,174
he's saying that he obviously they're,
they're equally applicable to people 

604
00:23:53,361 --> 00:23:55,220
living in the United States,
but really who he's talking to,

605
00:23:55,221 --> 00:23:56,054
and everybody knew this and it was 
repeated ad nauseum in the media was 

606
00:23:57,921 --> 00:23:59,750
he's talking to white,
blue collar voters from Ohio,

607
00:23:59,751 --> 00:24:01,340
Pennsylvania,
Michigan and Wisconsin.

608
00:24:01,670 --> 00:24:02,503
And when you say to people that you can 
indirectly tax other people for your 

609
00:24:05,631 --> 00:24:07,790
benefit,
which is what a tariff is,

610
00:24:07,970 --> 00:24:08,803
but it's okay for the white people,
but we also don't like the welfare 

611
00:24:10,701 --> 00:24:14,150
system for the black people,
then you start getting into some really,

612
00:24:14,151 --> 00:24:14,984
you know,
kind of interesting political territory 

613
00:24:16,280 --> 00:24:20,600
and the idea that it was a totally race 
free campaign by trump is not true.

614
00:24:20,601 --> 00:24:21,110
I mean,
it just,

615
00:24:21,110 --> 00:24:24,140
it wasn't like the,
the fact is that Donald Trump was making

616
00:24:24,430 --> 00:24:26,330
a,
not overt references to race,

617
00:24:26,331 --> 00:24:27,164
but he was making subtle appeals on the 
basis of race free campaign or there 

618
00:24:31,431 --> 00:24:32,270
people,
I think there are people,

619
00:24:32,271 --> 00:24:33,104
yeah,
I mean Kellyanne Conway to go to 

620
00:24:33,471 --> 00:24:34,010
example,
right?

621
00:24:34,010 --> 00:24:34,843
She says,
she said there was a big debate between 

622
00:24:36,651 --> 00:24:38,960
her and Jen Palmieri from the Clinton 
campaign and Jen Palmieri,

623
00:24:38,961 --> 00:24:41,930
he said that you guys were pandering to 
the outright and Kellyanne Conway said,

624
00:24:41,931 --> 00:24:42,764
you're,
you're accusing me of being part of a 

625
00:24:43,131 --> 00:24:44,570
campaign that would pander to the alt 
right.

626
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:46,250
And Jen Palmieri.
He said,

627
00:24:46,251 --> 00:24:47,660
yeah,
and,

628
00:24:47,690 --> 00:24:49,010
but Kelly entered the who?
Me,

629
00:24:49,011 --> 00:24:49,821
me,
what?

630
00:24:49,821 --> 00:24:51,110
And it's like,
oh yeah,

631
00:24:51,111 --> 00:24:53,810
you a little bit.
And yet at the same time,

632
00:24:53,811 --> 00:24:56,180
the Democrats were pandering to 
everybody keeps saying,

633
00:24:56,181 --> 00:24:58,460
we don't exactly,
don't talk about race,

634
00:24:58,610 --> 00:25:01,310
but every other line was raised.
Exactly.

635
00:25:01,311 --> 00:25:02,144
And so it's,
and so you have both sides playing the 

636
00:25:03,591 --> 00:25:04,424
same game now,
and none of them are playing inside the 

637
00:25:05,601 --> 00:25:07,640
mentality that we're where I exist.
Which,

638
00:25:07,641 --> 00:25:08,474
you know,
you put it outside the conservative box 

639
00:25:09,321 --> 00:25:13,220
for a second.
I am essentially a radical individualist

640
00:25:13,430 --> 00:25:16,310
in the sense that I think that people 
ought to be treated as individuals.

641
00:25:16,310 --> 00:25:17,660
They shouldn't be treated as part of 
groups.

642
00:25:17,870 --> 00:25:20,930
And so treating voters as part of a 
group or a classical liberal.

643
00:25:20,980 --> 00:25:21,860
Yeah,
that's right.

644
00:25:21,861 --> 00:25:23,090
That's right.
And did have that.

645
00:25:23,240 --> 00:25:24,073
Sure.
Unlike the European style classical 

646
00:25:25,251 --> 00:25:25,980
limmer.
Yeah,

647
00:25:25,980 --> 00:25:26,990
I mean except the,
yeah,

648
00:25:26,991 --> 00:25:27,824
I mean with,
with some really like the conservative 

649
00:25:28,761 --> 00:25:31,050
thing enough that even to say that I 
know,

650
00:25:31,070 --> 00:25:31,903
I mean I'm more,
I'm more kind of a conservative 

651
00:25:32,721 --> 00:25:33,554
libertarian mashup than anything else.
I think the government sucks at 

652
00:25:34,851 --> 00:25:35,661
everything,
right?

653
00:25:35,661 --> 00:25:37,640
I mean like we've talked about same sex 
marriage before.

654
00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:40,190
I personally against same sex marriage,
but I don't think the government has any

655
00:25:40,191 --> 00:25:41,510
business in it.
And personally,

656
00:25:41,511 --> 00:25:42,321
again,
smoking marijuana,

657
00:25:42,321 --> 00:25:44,540
I don't think the government has pretty 
much any business in it.

658
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:45,553
If you're not creating extra analogies,
I don't think that the government has 

659
00:25:47,001 --> 00:25:47,834
any business messing with you.
So that's why I can sit across from you 

660
00:25:50,091 --> 00:25:50,924
and you can say that and it doesn't 
bother me because at this point you're 

661
00:25:54,801 --> 00:25:56,900
not trying to stop either one of those 
things.

662
00:25:56,930 --> 00:25:57,763
Right.
Exactly.

663
00:25:57,890 --> 00:25:58,723
Why?
So you can believe what you want to 

664
00:25:59,631 --> 00:26:00,650
believe.
They said that this is,

665
00:26:01,260 --> 00:26:03,850
I know I'm supposed to be offended.
Right,

666
00:26:03,860 --> 00:26:04,461
exactly.
But this is,

667
00:26:04,461 --> 00:26:05,294
this is the thing that is so funny.
I was talking to somebody one time and 

668
00:26:06,591 --> 00:26:07,161
they were saying,
you know,

669
00:26:07,161 --> 00:26:08,180
as a,
as a religious person,

670
00:26:08,181 --> 00:26:10,940
you think homosexual behavior is a sin 
as a right,

671
00:26:10,941 --> 00:26:11,751
as an Orthodox Jew,
right?

672
00:26:11,751 --> 00:26:13,130
It's in the Bible.
I think it's a sin.

673
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:14,660
Here's the beautiful thing about 
America.

674
00:26:14,690 --> 00:26:16,530
You don't have to give a crap.
You don't,

675
00:26:16,810 --> 00:26:18,050
you can think I'm an idiot.
That's fine.

676
00:26:18,110 --> 00:26:19,390
Right.
Welcome to America and,

677
00:26:19,391 --> 00:26:20,224
and yeah,
you don't use seriously can completely 

678
00:26:21,831 --> 00:26:22,664
disregard everything I'm saying because 
I'm not trying to use a gun to enforce 

679
00:26:24,721 --> 00:26:25,554
my opinion against you.
And actually you're not even trying to 

680
00:26:28,041 --> 00:26:29,330
use the Bible because,
right,

681
00:26:29,331 --> 00:26:31,310
exactly.
We're not trying to govern by the Bible.

682
00:26:31,311 --> 00:26:32,540
That's,
that's you're saying.

683
00:26:32,570 --> 00:26:33,403
That's right.
You're saying you have your private 

684
00:26:34,371 --> 00:26:35,150
belief.
Right.

685
00:26:35,150 --> 00:26:36,260
Exactly.
Exactly.

686
00:26:36,310 --> 00:26:37,143
We lose this ability to have the private
league because did you see this about a 

687
00:26:39,770 --> 00:26:40,550
week ago?
Uh,

688
00:26:40,550 --> 00:26:43,980
buzzfeed did a piece on the two people 
from that

689
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:47,190
Hg TV show.
Blanking on the show.

690
00:26:47,191 --> 00:26:48,840
I watch it sometimes.
You want to be one of the gains couple.

691
00:26:48,841 --> 00:26:49,321
Yeah,
the gaines,

692
00:26:49,321 --> 00:26:50,700
Joanna,
and what I can remember,

693
00:26:51,450 --> 00:26:52,440
I don't want your child,
but yeah,

694
00:26:53,040 --> 00:26:53,491
they,
you know,

695
00:26:53,491 --> 00:26:56,570
they do this house flipping show.
It might be great flip or flop or,

696
00:26:57,480 --> 00:26:58,980
or whatever it's called.
Uh,

697
00:26:59,190 --> 00:27:02,130
but the point is that what it is,
so I've watched the show many times,

698
00:27:02,131 --> 00:27:04,920
they strike me as two completely benign,
whatever.

699
00:27:04,921 --> 00:27:07,320
Find people like their jobs seem like 
these people.

700
00:27:07,560 --> 00:27:08,393
And the whole piece in buzzfeed wasn't 
that they go to a church that's against 

701
00:27:11,581 --> 00:27:12,414
gay marriage.
And I thought this is the worst kind of 

702
00:27:14,611 --> 00:27:16,940
smear job nonsense.
Exactly.

703
00:27:17,240 --> 00:27:18,720
And,
but when did that become,

704
00:27:18,721 --> 00:27:20,130
okay,
so what?

705
00:27:20,220 --> 00:27:21,053
They go to a church where we don't know 
what their beliefs are on it and I 

706
00:27:23,251 --> 00:27:24,120
wouldn't care actually.

707
00:27:24,180 --> 00:27:24,721
Right,
exactly.

708
00:27:24,721 --> 00:27:25,554
And even if they believe that as long as
they're not manifesting that in 

709
00:27:27,191 --> 00:27:28,830
discrimination against gay people,
who gives a crap,

710
00:27:28,860 --> 00:27:29,491
right?
I mean,

711
00:27:29,491 --> 00:27:30,420
this is,
this is ridiculous.

712
00:27:30,421 --> 00:27:31,170
I mean,
first of all,

713
00:27:31,170 --> 00:27:34,130
the idea that HDTV is short on pandering
to gay people isn't,

714
00:27:34,131 --> 00:27:35,460
it?
Is Patently insane.

715
00:27:35,461 --> 00:27:37,260
Okay.
My wife watches HGTV.

716
00:27:37,261 --> 00:27:40,920
We learned all about,
but let's,

717
00:27:40,950 --> 00:27:41,670
let's,
uh,

718
00:27:41,670 --> 00:27:42,600
but it,
it is amazing.

719
00:27:42,601 --> 00:27:44,850
I mean that sort of thought policing.
Uh,

720
00:27:44,910 --> 00:27:46,560
I mean that's existed for a couple of 
decades,

721
00:27:46,740 --> 00:27:49,680
probably since the 60s for the left.
But the fact that it's starting to exist

722
00:27:49,681 --> 00:27:51,360
a little bit on the right is what 
frightens me is,

723
00:27:51,370 --> 00:27:52,800
is the,
the thought policing,

724
00:27:52,980 --> 00:27:53,813
uh,
that I see because policies become a 

725
00:27:55,411 --> 00:27:56,790
loyalty test,
but it's also

726
00:27:56,970 --> 00:27:57,803
so selective in what everyone does.
Because I would guarantee you mentioned 

727
00:28:00,391 --> 00:28:01,224
Keith Ellison a moment ago.
I'm going to guess that the mosque that 

728
00:28:03,091 --> 00:28:06,810
he goes to is probably the mom is 
probably not for gay marriage,

729
00:28:07,140 --> 00:28:09,210
but buzzfeed I do.
I'm just guessing on that.

730
00:28:09,211 --> 00:28:12,810
But I'm pretty sure that that's majority
mosques are not yet probably 99.9%

731
00:28:12,811 --> 00:28:14,370
of mosques in America or not.
Okay.

732
00:28:14,371 --> 00:28:15,204
That's fine.
They can have their personal religious 

733
00:28:16,831 --> 00:28:17,664
belief,
but buzzfeed would never do a piece on 

734
00:28:19,291 --> 00:28:20,124
that.
If anything,

735
00:28:20,280 --> 00:28:23,340
they'll whitewash everything he's ever 
said about fire can and everything else.

736
00:28:23,341 --> 00:28:23,971
Right,
exactly.

737
00:28:23,971 --> 00:28:25,890
So that just shows you how the media 
has,

738
00:28:25,940 --> 00:28:26,470
and I

739
00:28:26,470 --> 00:28:26,971
again,
they did,

740
00:28:26,971 --> 00:28:29,020
they said that they were fine with,
with Obama's excuse.

741
00:28:29,021 --> 00:28:29,854
Then you went to a church for 20 years 
where Jeremiah Wright was preaching the 

742
00:28:31,421 --> 00:28:33,460
most insane crap imaginable from the 
pulpit.

743
00:28:33,700 --> 00:28:34,301
And they just went,
okay,

744
00:28:34,301 --> 00:28:34,631
well,
you know,

745
00:28:34,631 --> 00:28:36,440
that's his church and nobody says he has
to believe that.

746
00:28:36,441 --> 00:28:36,851
And I said,
wait,

747
00:28:36,851 --> 00:28:38,110
wait a second,
why does that,

748
00:28:38,111 --> 00:28:39,980
that's okay for Obama,
but it's not to confirm gains.

749
00:28:40,120 --> 00:28:40,930
Yeah.
Obama is like the,

750
00:28:40,930 --> 00:28:42,370
he's going to actually run for 
president.

751
00:28:42,371 --> 00:28:44,890
Like if at any point the guy's views are
going to be relevant,

752
00:28:44,891 --> 00:28:46,840
you would think it's more of that then,
I don't know,

753
00:28:46,841 --> 00:28:47,674
are you gonna knock out a,
a barrier and create an open kitchen 

754
00:28:50,921 --> 00:28:52,760
concept on HIV baby?
Right,

755
00:28:53,090 --> 00:28:53,800
right.
It's a,

756
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:54,491
yeah,
it is.

757
00:28:54,491 --> 00:28:55,780
It is.
It is pretty,

758
00:28:55,930 --> 00:28:57,640
it's pretty wild how far things have 
gone.

759
00:28:57,940 --> 00:28:59,140
Um,
and I'm hoping that,

760
00:28:59,170 --> 00:29:00,003
I think that a lot of people who are 
hoping that trump is going to be a blow 

761
00:29:01,701 --> 00:29:02,640
back against that,
that,

762
00:29:02,650 --> 00:29:05,110
that there'll be less thought policing,
uh,

763
00:29:05,111 --> 00:29:07,630
under trump.
But that also has to apply to trump,

764
00:29:08,130 --> 00:29:08,471
right?
Right.

765
00:29:08,471 --> 00:29:10,560
Then has to apply to trump himself and 
it has to apply to the chief.

766
00:29:10,740 --> 00:29:11,573
When Kellyanne Conway's tagging people,
the bosses on twitter that they don't 

767
00:29:14,881 --> 00:29:15,631
like,
that doesn't,

768
00:29:15,631 --> 00:29:16,140
that's not a good thing.

769
00:29:16,140 --> 00:29:17,660
Let me,
Donald Trump was making those noises all

770
00:29:17,661 --> 00:29:18,530
throughout the campaign.
Right.

771
00:29:18,531 --> 00:29:19,364
He said he wants to rewrite libel law,
which for people in our business is 

772
00:29:21,591 --> 00:29:22,371
like,
I mean,

773
00:29:22,371 --> 00:29:25,010
all we do all day is sit and give 
opinions on people.

774
00:29:25,370 --> 00:29:27,830
And the idea that we're going to be sued
for giving those opinions,

775
00:29:28,130 --> 00:29:28,641
uh,
is,

776
00:29:28,641 --> 00:29:29,474
uh,
is pretty frightening thing in the 

777
00:29:29,871 --> 00:29:30,650
United States.

778
00:29:30,650 --> 00:29:32,360
Yeah.
But it isn't so much of that though,

779
00:29:32,361 --> 00:29:33,194
and I think you've already said this,
but that it's just a reaction to the 

780
00:29:35,481 --> 00:29:36,050
lunacy.

781
00:29:36,050 --> 00:29:37,910
Yeah.
Trump's reaction and the reaction to him

782
00:29:37,911 --> 00:29:39,290
is reactionary.
There's no question,

783
00:29:39,291 --> 00:29:41,120
but reactionary politics is bad 
politics.

784
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:42,110
Right.
You should have the,

785
00:29:42,110 --> 00:29:45,440
the reaction to the left has been 
breaking people down by,

786
00:29:45,670 --> 00:29:48,100
by race and by identity.
Politics is not,

787
00:29:48,550 --> 00:29:49,151
well,
screw them.

788
00:29:49,151 --> 00:29:51,400
Let's do identity politics too.
If they can do what we can do it,

789
00:29:51,550 --> 00:29:52,330
you know,
that's not the,

790
00:29:52,330 --> 00:29:53,770
that's not the way they got to play the 
game.

791
00:29:53,771 --> 00:29:54,600
I mean,
it's,

792
00:29:54,600 --> 00:29:56,470
and if you think that's the only way we 
can win,

793
00:29:56,770 --> 00:29:58,960
then we're bound for a European style 
politics.

794
00:29:58,961 --> 00:29:59,794
It's the end of American politics.
Like what America used to be about was 

795
00:30:02,021 --> 00:30:04,840
the idea that as individuals,
we disagreed about a lot of things,

796
00:30:04,841 --> 00:30:06,850
but we agreed that we were going to be 
treated as individuals,

797
00:30:06,851 --> 00:30:08,710
or at least that was the,
that was supposed to be the promise that

798
00:30:08,711 --> 00:30:10,210
we were attempting to fulfill.
Uh,

799
00:30:10,310 --> 00:30:11,143
in Europe,
it all breaks down according to 

800
00:30:11,711 --> 00:30:12,544
demographic lines and you just have a 
battle between the big government right 

801
00:30:14,281 --> 00:30:15,114
in the big government left and are you 
going to let in immigrants this time or 

802
00:30:16,811 --> 00:30:18,310
you're not going to get let in 
immigrants this time?

803
00:30:18,311 --> 00:30:19,060
That's,
that's,

804
00:30:19,060 --> 00:30:19,893
yeah.
And I think that we're in danger of 

805
00:30:20,981 --> 00:30:22,360
moving that way.
Just we're going to,

806
00:30:22,361 --> 00:30:26,230
we're going to show it and freight our 
way right into something really ugly.

807
00:30:26,310 --> 00:30:27,630
Yeah.
In a weird way though,

808
00:30:27,631 --> 00:30:29,640
this presents a tremendous amount of 
opportunity,

809
00:30:29,641 --> 00:30:30,474
right?
I was telling you right before we 

810
00:30:30,781 --> 00:30:32,430
started,
I was with you a couple of weeks ago,

811
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:35,940
a Dennis prager had a,
had a fundraiser and I thought he gave a

812
00:30:35,941 --> 00:30:36,774
really great speech about basically 
saying the world is in a really nuts 

813
00:30:41,671 --> 00:30:44,400
place right now and maybe we have to 
find allies and other places.

814
00:30:44,401 --> 00:30:46,860
And that's what I think I've tried to 
do.

815
00:30:46,861 --> 00:30:49,530
So there is for all the chaos of it.
Yeah,

816
00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:50,460
there's some real life.

817
00:30:50,460 --> 00:30:51,181
I mean,
I hope so.

818
00:30:51,181 --> 00:30:52,080
I hope so.
And I hope that it's,

819
00:30:52,300 --> 00:30:55,530
I think it's a good opportunity for a,
and when I do my podcast,

820
00:30:55,531 --> 00:30:57,410
I actually keep a physical shoe on the 
side and I,

821
00:30:57,411 --> 00:30:59,280
and I hold it up and I say,
put this on the other foot.

822
00:30:59,610 --> 00:31:00,690
Right?
Whenever it trump does something.

823
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:02,220
So you just put this on there that with 
Obama did this,

824
00:31:02,221 --> 00:31:03,054
how would you feel?
And it's a good opportunity for people 

825
00:31:04,501 --> 00:31:05,334
on the left to do the same thing.
I think that if we all sort of take the 

826
00:31:07,441 --> 00:31:08,274
shoe and put it on the other foot,
like now you're very upset with what 

827
00:31:09,691 --> 00:31:10,830
trump's doing,
but how are you with it?

828
00:31:10,831 --> 00:31:12,000
When,
when Obama was doing it,

829
00:31:12,001 --> 00:31:12,930
if you think is bad,
when trump's doing,

830
00:31:12,931 --> 00:31:15,180
and maybe it was bad when Obama was 
doing it and for the right,

831
00:31:15,181 --> 00:31:16,014
if you were really pissed off about it 
when Obama was doing it and now trump's 

832
00:31:17,791 --> 00:31:18,624
doing it,
maybe you should be pissed off when 

833
00:31:19,781 --> 00:31:20,614
trump's doing it.

834
00:31:20,730 --> 00:31:21,840
Ah,
and if everybody applied,

835
00:31:21,841 --> 00:31:23,540
that sort of intellectual honesty I 
think to,

836
00:31:23,541 --> 00:31:27,120
to whatever our politicians do,
we'd be significantly better off.

837
00:31:27,121 --> 00:31:29,520
Because the fact is that it's the team 
sport of it,

838
00:31:29,521 --> 00:31:30,354
the ruins it,
it's a team sport of it that where you 

839
00:31:31,681 --> 00:31:33,020
end up with,
I'm going to root for,

840
00:31:33,040 --> 00:31:34,770
for my guy,
just no matter what he does,

841
00:31:34,771 --> 00:31:37,550
no matter what rules he breaks.
And this is why I've said it's not seems

842
00:31:37,560 --> 00:31:40,140
more politics is not team sport.
Like as a white sox fan,

843
00:31:40,141 --> 00:31:43,520
there was a catcher who caught for us 
named Aga presents gate at aeg presents.

844
00:31:43,521 --> 00:31:44,354
He was a player that everybody hated and
still hates in the major thing plays to 

845
00:31:46,831 --> 00:31:47,664
the braves.
Now they despise him cause he was this 

846
00:31:49,051 --> 00:31:51,780
guy who had like cut any corner to win.
And when he's not on your team,

847
00:31:51,781 --> 00:31:52,614
you hate him.
And then he's on your team and you'll 

848
00:31:53,041 --> 00:31:53,481
love him.
Right?

849
00:31:53,481 --> 00:31:55,650
Yes.
Anything in order to win.

850
00:31:55,830 --> 00:31:58,370
The problem is that when you apply that 
to politics and it's,

851
00:31:58,410 --> 00:32:00,330
if he's on my team and he'll do anything
to win,

852
00:32:00,360 --> 00:32:01,680
that's awesome.
Yeah.

853
00:32:01,710 --> 00:32:04,560
Well except for it isn't because now you
have to,

854
00:32:04,620 --> 00:32:06,930
you have to be standing up for people 
doing bad things.

855
00:32:07,030 --> 00:32:08,350
Yeah.
And that's the strange thing.

856
00:32:08,351 --> 00:32:08,801
I mean,
look,

857
00:32:08,801 --> 00:32:10,690
if you were for all these people that 
are upset that Oh,

858
00:32:11,380 --> 00:32:14,940
trump might be a warmonger or might be 
against the press neck,

859
00:32:14,941 --> 00:32:16,450
he might be,
but at this,

860
00:32:16,451 --> 00:32:17,284
but hey,
he didn't run certainly on on a pro war 

861
00:32:18,551 --> 00:32:19,384
policy will be,
Obama has been doing drone strikes into 

862
00:32:21,641 --> 00:32:23,800
Afghanistan,
strikes in Pakistan,

863
00:32:24,310 --> 00:32:25,143
ask Edward Snowden how he's been for 
press freedom and all that kind of 

864
00:32:27,101 --> 00:32:28,540
stuff.
So regardless of what,

865
00:32:28,580 --> 00:32:30,220
how were you feeling?
Terrible for press brakes.

866
00:32:30,490 --> 00:32:31,240
It's like,
wait,

867
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:32,073
nobody,
why weren't you guys saying anything 

868
00:32:32,921 --> 00:32:33,880
that you'd have a little more right.
Yeah.

869
00:32:34,060 --> 00:32:35,890
You'd have a little more weight to your 
words now.

870
00:32:35,970 --> 00:32:38,250
Exactly.
I said this on Brian stelter show on CNN

871
00:32:38,251 --> 00:32:39,860
is they were going over,
this is when,

872
00:32:39,861 --> 00:32:41,330
when trump was tweeting against 
Hamilton,

873
00:32:41,810 --> 00:32:42,440
and I said,
like,

874
00:32:42,440 --> 00:32:43,730
let's,
let's be fair to both sides.

875
00:32:43,731 --> 00:32:45,650
If Obama had done this to a nascar 
event,

876
00:32:45,651 --> 00:32:47,990
like some Nascar event in 2011 boot,
Michelle,

877
00:32:47,991 --> 00:32:48,824
and he'd gone on and said,
these Nascar people should shut up and 

878
00:32:50,631 --> 00:32:51,830
apologize.
Basically,

879
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:52,930
you know,
it would've been applauded,

880
00:32:52,940 --> 00:32:54,590
but he would have been applauded by the 
left.

881
00:32:54,591 --> 00:32:57,770
And now trump does on Hamilton and it's 
just the end of the world.

882
00:32:57,771 --> 00:32:58,604
Oh my God,
he's going to shut down our beloved 

883
00:32:59,271 --> 00:33:00,170
Hamilton.
And he's,

884
00:33:00,171 --> 00:33:01,730
by the way is right.
It's an overrated musical.

885
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:02,833
But the,
but,

886
00:33:02,870 --> 00:33:05,690
but on the other side,
I haven't seen it on the other side.

887
00:33:05,870 --> 00:33:06,261
Uh,
you know,

888
00:33:06,261 --> 00:33:07,430
he had people on the right and they're 
like,

889
00:33:07,431 --> 00:33:08,330
yeah,
look at trump.

890
00:33:08,330 --> 00:33:09,141
Really punching,
really,

891
00:33:09,141 --> 00:33:10,700
really taking it to them.
I was like,

892
00:33:10,701 --> 00:33:13,370
all right,
but when Obama did exactly the same sort

893
00:33:13,371 --> 00:33:15,500
of stuff,
when he was calling out Fox News by name

894
00:33:15,530 --> 00:33:19,010
and saying that it was that they were 
destroying the political process,

895
00:33:19,011 --> 00:33:19,610
we were saying,
wait,

896
00:33:19,610 --> 00:33:20,443
the the president of the United States 
should be going out and attacking 

897
00:33:21,531 --> 00:33:23,480
specific news outlets for how they 
report.

898
00:33:23,481 --> 00:33:24,620
That's really gross.
It's so funny.

899
00:33:24,621 --> 00:33:26,840
I had somebody tweet me saying,
why didn't you ever say this stuff about

900
00:33:26,841 --> 00:33:27,674
Obama?
And I linked directly to a video from 

901
00:33:29,061 --> 00:33:33,020
2013 I said exactly this about Obama and
it's in again,

902
00:33:33,050 --> 00:33:35,580
you could probably spend your whole life
trying to correct the things that people

903
00:33:35,581 --> 00:33:36,414
tweet.
But that's what happens is that people 

904
00:33:36,981 --> 00:33:38,180
get into this,
the,

905
00:33:38,290 --> 00:33:38,661
the,
the,

906
00:33:38,661 --> 00:33:41,180
they get into this mode where,
yeah,

907
00:33:41,181 --> 00:33:43,610
when Obama did it,
it was the Democrats didn't care.

908
00:33:43,960 --> 00:33:44,391
And it's like,
yeah,

909
00:33:44,391 --> 00:33:45,920
but that,
that argument also applies to you.

910
00:33:46,340 --> 00:33:48,890
You did care when Obama did it and now 
you're pretending not to.

911
00:33:48,891 --> 00:33:51,140
So the hypocrisy argument cuts both 
ways.

912
00:33:51,141 --> 00:33:51,974
It's double edged sword.
He can't claim the Democrats are 

913
00:33:52,941 --> 00:33:53,774
hypocrites about trump at the same time 
that you're being a hypocrite about 

914
00:33:55,551 --> 00:33:56,630
Obama.
All right,

915
00:33:56,631 --> 00:33:57,464
so let's shift away from a little bit of
the horse race pilot from broader 

916
00:34:00,741 --> 00:34:01,940
themes.
So the free speech stuff,

917
00:34:02,600 --> 00:34:04,280
you have been in the thick of it.
I mean,

918
00:34:04,281 --> 00:34:05,690
yeah,
it's going to party truly,

919
00:34:05,691 --> 00:34:08,510
truly in the thick of this,
you get protested at pretty much every,

920
00:34:08,810 --> 00:34:10,600
when's the last time you were at a 
university that you weren't protests?

921
00:34:10,650 --> 00:34:11,850
And I mean,
I would say half the universities.

922
00:34:11,860 --> 00:34:13,180
I go try,
I protest protested.

923
00:34:13,220 --> 00:34:14,620
I mean I go to a lot of universities.
I,

924
00:34:14,621 --> 00:34:17,030
I've,
I've spoken at 10 in the last two months

925
00:34:17,170 --> 00:34:17,630
I would say.

926
00:34:17,630 --> 00:34:20,300
I guess I only hear about the one,
we only see the headlines about the ones

927
00:34:20,301 --> 00:34:22,700
where there are heavy protests had taken
maybe a third of them.

928
00:34:22,701 --> 00:34:24,080
I get heavy protests.
Okay.

929
00:34:24,081 --> 00:34:26,480
So about a third of them,
you're getting heavy protests now.

930
00:34:26,810 --> 00:34:27,643
I would venture to say that for everyone
that's listening to this interview so 

931
00:34:29,361 --> 00:34:31,040
far,
whether they agree with you or not,

932
00:34:31,041 --> 00:34:35,060
you don't seem to be a hate monger or 
some sort of white supremacist or Jewish

933
00:34:35,061 --> 00:34:38,290
supremacist or some other Nazi related 
something or other like,

934
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:41,150
okay,
what are these people thinking?

935
00:34:41,200 --> 00:34:43,910
What do you really think is going on for
these people?

936
00:34:43,911 --> 00:34:46,100
Cause it's a lot of misguided nonsense.
And,

937
00:34:46,120 --> 00:34:49,160
and I've spoke at Ucla with Milo,
which is a whole separate crowd.

938
00:34:49,490 --> 00:34:51,410
Your crowd obviously.
Uh,

939
00:34:51,470 --> 00:34:53,480
but there are protesting him too.
Yeah.

940
00:34:53,720 --> 00:34:55,230
Well,
I mean I think that the,

941
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:56,113
for the most part people,
I don't assume my own level of 

942
00:34:58,941 --> 00:34:59,774
notoriety.
So I think that most of the people who 

943
00:35:00,441 --> 00:35:02,120
are protesting me,
I've never heard anything that I've said

944
00:35:02,121 --> 00:35:03,110
or read anything that I've written.

945
00:35:05,380 --> 00:35:05,901
Yeah,
exactly.

946
00:35:05,901 --> 00:35:06,734
When I was at Wisconsin,
one of the things that a lot of the 

947
00:35:07,971 --> 00:35:08,804
fliers come out and the fliers put like 
the most provocative title they can to 

948
00:35:10,821 --> 00:35:11,654
get people to come.
Right.

949
00:35:11,710 --> 00:35:14,270
Um,
and then usually that they're,

950
00:35:14,271 --> 00:35:14,991
they're fine.
But it did.

951
00:35:14,991 --> 00:35:15,900
But,
uh,

952
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:18,080
for example,
Wisconsin,

953
00:35:18,081 --> 00:35:22,220
I had people getting up and chanting.
I had a guy right at the beginning stand

954
00:35:22,221 --> 00:35:25,520
up and say something about how I was 
enabling Hitler.

955
00:35:25,670 --> 00:35:26,451
And I was like,
dude,

956
00:35:26,451 --> 00:35:27,650
do you see the Yamaka?
Like what are,

957
00:35:27,651 --> 00:35:30,170
what are you even talking about?
Like what are you talking about?

958
00:35:30,350 --> 00:35:33,290
And then they were chanting,
they were chanting f white supremacy.

959
00:35:33,291 --> 00:35:33,521
It,
man,

960
00:35:33,521 --> 00:35:34,354
it's like I've been spending this entire
election cycle under assault from the 

961
00:35:37,951 --> 00:35:39,060
white supremacists,
right?

962
00:35:39,450 --> 00:35:41,220
Because I told them that they,
that they're wrong.

963
00:35:41,221 --> 00:35:42,054
And I think that they're evil and the,
and literally the number one online 

964
00:35:46,021 --> 00:35:48,250
target of the,
all right,

965
00:35:48,260 --> 00:35:48,930
so how about right?

966
00:35:48,930 --> 00:35:49,763
Yeah,
exactly.

967
00:35:50,060 --> 00:35:51,240
Yeah.
And so,

968
00:35:51,300 --> 00:35:53,010
but I'm getting protested by it,
by the,

969
00:35:53,011 --> 00:35:55,740
by the blm crowd.
And so it's,

970
00:35:56,370 --> 00:35:57,203
I think that it comes from ignorance.
I think it comes from this place where 

971
00:35:58,711 --> 00:36:02,640
any opposing view must be attacked and 
we don't even have to do our research.

972
00:36:02,641 --> 00:36:04,860
We don't have to try and debunk it.
It's a bunking.

973
00:36:04,861 --> 00:36:07,500
It actually takes effort going and 
yelling about it doesn't take any effort

974
00:36:07,501 --> 00:36:08,334
at all.
And that's why whenever I do these 

975
00:36:09,031 --> 00:36:11,430
lectures,
the first thing I do when we do q and,

976
00:36:11,431 --> 00:36:11,881
a,
as I say,

977
00:36:11,881 --> 00:36:13,620
if you disagree with me,
you get to go first.

978
00:36:14,010 --> 00:36:17,780
All people who disagree go to the front 
of the line and it's and it,

979
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:18,713
cause that's always more interesting and
I treat the people who disagree with me 

980
00:36:21,061 --> 00:36:22,470
actually with respect.
If you're not,

981
00:36:22,471 --> 00:36:25,380
if you're not yelling at me and you're 
not flipping me off and shutting f white

982
00:36:25,381 --> 00:36:26,214
supremacy,
I'm happy to treat you with respect and 

983
00:36:27,361 --> 00:36:28,140
have a civil discussion.

984
00:36:28,140 --> 00:36:30,690
I do it all the time and that's the one 
you can win over.

985
00:36:30,780 --> 00:36:31,613
Right,
exactly.

986
00:36:32,190 --> 00:36:35,550
It's selfishly rewarding for you because
that's the guy who was on the fence that

987
00:36:35,551 --> 00:36:39,030
might come to your thigh or at the very 
least we can have a discussion where the

988
00:36:39,031 --> 00:36:40,830
person gives a point.
I get the counterpoint and all the,

989
00:36:40,831 --> 00:36:42,900
all the whole audience is smarter for 
it,

990
00:36:43,150 --> 00:36:43,983
that the audience is not smarter for 
having these people chance and stand in 

991
00:36:46,111 --> 00:36:46,944
front of the stage and try to disrupt an
event and me write more ons on the trop 

992
00:36:49,951 --> 00:36:51,180
board behind them.
I mean,

993
00:36:51,181 --> 00:36:53,190
it's fun for me and I think it's fun for
the crowd,

994
00:36:53,191 --> 00:36:54,024
but it's not,
but it's not informative in any way 

995
00:36:55,771 --> 00:36:57,720
except to show that there are these 
people who are out there.

996
00:36:58,410 --> 00:36:59,243
How does it feel just just on the 
personal level when this stuff's 

997
00:37:01,261 --> 00:37:01,640
happening?

998
00:37:01,640 --> 00:37:02,670
Cause there are threats.
I mean,

999
00:37:02,671 --> 00:37:03,610
again,
when I was at Ucla,

1000
00:37:03,611 --> 00:37:06,030
I think there was a bomb threat.
People bashing on the door,

1001
00:37:06,210 --> 00:37:08,490
seemed like they were coming in 
screaming like we didn't know if by,

1002
00:37:08,491 --> 00:37:09,450
you know,
uh,

1003
00:37:09,810 --> 00:37:11,510
anything violent could happen.
Like all that stuff.

1004
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:14,250
Like just on a purely personal note,
you are a person,

1005
00:37:14,251 --> 00:37:16,530
you're a relatively new father I think.
Like,

1006
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:17,770
yeah,
I've got two kids in three years.

1007
00:37:17,771 --> 00:37:18,201
Yeah.
Okay.

1008
00:37:18,201 --> 00:37:19,034
So just on that note,
like putting yourself out there like 

1009
00:37:21,301 --> 00:37:22,560
that,
what do you make of that?

1010
00:37:22,620 --> 00:37:23,011
Uh,
well,

1011
00:37:23,011 --> 00:37:24,030
I mean,
I don't tell my wife about it.

1012
00:37:24,740 --> 00:37:25,980
She,
she not on twitter,

1013
00:37:27,250 --> 00:37:29,640
on twitter.
She does not do the facebook thing.

1014
00:37:29,770 --> 00:37:31,090
I off everything.
Yeah,

1015
00:37:31,091 --> 00:37:31,771
exactly.
Like,

1016
00:37:31,771 --> 00:37:32,251
Hey,
she's,

1017
00:37:32,251 --> 00:37:34,020
she's kind of protected from it.
Um,

1018
00:37:34,050 --> 00:37:34,883
I have,
I feel like I'm usually the safest 

1019
00:37:36,571 --> 00:37:38,190
person in the room.
I'm the only guy there were security,

1020
00:37:38,191 --> 00:37:38,370
right?

1021
00:37:38,370 --> 00:37:39,940
So I've got my own private security,
uh,

1022
00:37:40,020 --> 00:37:42,300
that we contract to do these things.
The first time we did it,

1023
00:37:42,301 --> 00:37:43,530
I was like,
why are we even doing this?

1024
00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:46,410
And turned out that was cal state La and
there's like an actual riot there.

1025
00:37:46,830 --> 00:37:48,360
So it's,
so yeah,

1026
00:37:48,420 --> 00:37:49,470
I'm now,
I'm now,

1027
00:37:49,471 --> 00:37:52,050
I've got security guys who come with me.
Um,

1028
00:37:52,350 --> 00:37:54,510
I'm always relieved when it's not that 
because again,

1029
00:37:54,511 --> 00:37:56,670
I would much prefer to have just a 
normal,

1030
00:37:56,820 --> 00:38:00,480
like I'm not looking for the,
I really am not looking for the headline

1031
00:38:00,481 --> 00:38:01,314
that says protesters come in,
Shapiro finishes protesters or whatever 

1032
00:38:03,151 --> 00:38:04,110
like that.
Honestly,

1033
00:38:04,111 --> 00:38:06,060
that's easy for me.
It's not hard.

1034
00:38:06,061 --> 00:38:08,640
Like these people have a combined icu in
single digits.

1035
00:38:08,641 --> 00:38:11,100
It's not difficult to make stupid people
look stupid.

1036
00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:12,233
It's more difficult to actually have a 
conversation with somebody who has a 

1037
00:38:14,671 --> 00:38:15,900
point of view and some facts to back 
them.

1038
00:38:15,900 --> 00:38:17,050
I was more interesting.
Um,

1039
00:38:17,070 --> 00:38:17,903
but you know,
as far as the personal safety aspect of 

1040
00:38:19,291 --> 00:38:20,124
it,
um,

1041
00:38:20,760 --> 00:38:21,571
I,
it doesn't,

1042
00:38:21,571 --> 00:38:22,404
it doesn't concern me.
It's physical safety as much as just 

1043
00:38:23,791 --> 00:38:25,550
sort of your men mostly puzzled.
I'm like,

1044
00:38:25,830 --> 00:38:26,820
what?
Why?

1045
00:38:26,821 --> 00:38:27,654
Like what am I saying?
Like I'm here preaching decency and non 

1046
00:38:30,121 --> 00:38:32,520
identity group politics and I'm getting 
protested for that.

1047
00:38:32,550 --> 00:38:35,320
Like I have people yelling at me and 
threatening violence because of that.

1048
00:38:35,370 --> 00:38:36,850
Right.
I could understand if I were coming here

1049
00:38:36,851 --> 00:38:38,780
and I was saying something that's,
that's you know,

1050
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:41,590
actively calling for violence or 
something or even implying that violence

1051
00:38:41,591 --> 00:38:42,424
is okay in any way.
But half of my speeches are about why 

1052
00:38:43,901 --> 00:38:45,440
violence is never okay.
Right?

1053
00:38:45,450 --> 00:38:47,440
Like you don't get to hit people if you 
disagree with them.

1054
00:38:47,650 --> 00:38:48,483
And then to prove my point that come and
they try and hit people who disagree 

1055
00:38:49,961 --> 00:38:50,260
with them.

1056
00:38:50,260 --> 00:38:52,150
It's just like,
it's so bizarre.

1057
00:38:52,180 --> 00:38:53,470
Right.
Where were you with the,

1058
00:38:53,500 --> 00:38:55,480
with Christina Hoff.
Sommers Paul.

1059
00:38:55,481 --> 00:38:56,380
Yeah.
Paul.

1060
00:38:56,381 --> 00:38:58,480
Which depaul is banned by low.
Right.

1061
00:38:58,481 --> 00:38:58,871
And then the,
the,

1062
00:38:58,871 --> 00:39:01,810
well they ban Milo and then they 
immediately banned me on top of that.

1063
00:39:01,811 --> 00:39:02,410
Right.
Like housing.

1064
00:39:02,410 --> 00:39:03,510
They're like,
and,

1065
00:39:03,511 --> 00:39:05,290
and then first of all,
this is absurd.

1066
00:39:05,291 --> 00:39:06,124
They Ban Milo.
Everybody knows about the disagreements 

1067
00:39:08,051 --> 00:39:09,310
that I have with my,
but it's absurd.

1068
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:10,233
Milo getting banned from campuses.
I'm sure it makes me really happy 

1069
00:39:12,071 --> 00:39:13,510
because the headline,
but um,

1070
00:39:13,600 --> 00:39:16,210
but it's,
it's stupidity of the highest order.

1071
00:39:16,350 --> 00:39:17,440
Uh,
if you disagree with him,

1072
00:39:17,441 --> 00:39:18,910
go into bunk him.
Um,

1073
00:39:18,970 --> 00:39:20,260
if you disagree with them,
don't show up.

1074
00:39:20,261 --> 00:39:21,094
I mean,
that'd be the worst thing you can do to 

1075
00:39:21,341 --> 00:39:23,260
Milo is just not show up for one of his 
lectures.

1076
00:39:23,460 --> 00:39:24,330
Um,
but it's it.

1077
00:39:24,420 --> 00:39:25,570
But the,
you know,

1078
00:39:25,710 --> 00:39:27,400
they banned me on top of that at Depaul.

1079
00:39:27,640 --> 00:39:28,473
Uh,
and then they didn't even give it like 

1080
00:39:30,220 --> 00:39:32,830
they're only excuse was the security and
it was like,

1081
00:39:32,831 --> 00:39:35,080
he can't control your own students.
That's not my fault.

1082
00:39:35,081 --> 00:39:36,640
That's your fault.
You're a university.

1083
00:39:36,641 --> 00:39:38,680
Should be doing that.
And then you can go view the video.

1084
00:39:38,681 --> 00:39:39,850
They actually,
uh,

1085
00:39:39,940 --> 00:39:42,860
we announced that Christina was going to
be speaking there and I was going to,

1086
00:39:42,861 --> 00:39:43,694
you know,
accompany her and they wouldn't let me 

1087
00:39:45,101 --> 00:39:45,934
in the building as a guest.
They wouldn't let me in the building as 

1088
00:39:47,351 --> 00:39:48,184
a member of her team and they wouldn't 
let me in the building and just sit in 

1089
00:39:49,511 --> 00:39:50,344
the audience.
What are they saying to you at that 

1090
00:39:51,521 --> 00:39:53,980
time?
Are they saying because their people are

1091
00:39:53,981 --> 00:39:56,260
threatening violence and there were no 
threats of violence?

1092
00:39:56,261 --> 00:39:57,094
That was what was amazing at Depaul.
Like we walked up and the whole day 

1093
00:39:59,231 --> 00:40:00,064
they'd been telling my security team 
that if Shapiro shows up that we're 

1094
00:40:02,411 --> 00:40:03,100
going to arrest him.

1095
00:40:03,100 --> 00:40:05,710
If he shows up then we will literally 
and at the,

1096
00:40:05,711 --> 00:40:08,400
at the place for trespass.
Right.

1097
00:40:08,401 --> 00:40:10,870
So I mean that would be the crime is 
trespassing on their campus.

1098
00:40:10,990 --> 00:40:11,823
They literally went out and got a share 
from Cook County to sit there to 

1099
00:40:13,841 --> 00:40:16,930
facilitate the transfer of arrest.
If the campus police arrest you,

1100
00:40:16,931 --> 00:40:19,260
they have to have somebody from the 
county actually be,

1101
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:20,113
it's actually,
you have the guy sitting there in the 

1102
00:40:20,741 --> 00:40:22,630
law?
No protesters anywhere.

1103
00:40:22,660 --> 00:40:23,530
None.
Right.

1104
00:40:23,531 --> 00:40:28,210
I mean it's 30 police officers and 
security guards and me and I walk up and

1105
00:40:28,211 --> 00:40:29,620
I was like really?
Like I can't it like Sofa.

1106
00:40:29,621 --> 00:40:30,530
And I said,
you know,

1107
00:40:30,550 --> 00:40:32,290
if I take two steps forward,
are you going to arrest me?

1108
00:40:32,291 --> 00:40:34,270
And the guy said,
yeah and giant guy.

1109
00:40:35,080 --> 00:40:35,861
Yeah.
People were like,

1110
00:40:35,861 --> 00:40:36,740
you should have,
you should have gotten arrested.

1111
00:40:36,820 --> 00:40:37,653
It's like well you know at that point 
I'm really not so hot on spending the 

1112
00:40:41,141 --> 00:40:41,500
evening.

1113
00:40:41,500 --> 00:40:44,740
And They Cook County prison,
Cook County jail for the,

1114
00:40:44,920 --> 00:40:47,050
for the of your beliefs,
but not to the point of,

1115
00:40:47,590 --> 00:40:48,423
well again,
they actually have the right to arrest 

1116
00:40:50,321 --> 00:40:51,220
me.
It's a private university.

1117
00:40:51,221 --> 00:40:52,510
If it were a public university,
I would have walked,

1118
00:40:52,600 --> 00:40:54,040
if you were in private,
if a Republican diversity,

1119
00:40:54,041 --> 00:40:56,260
I would have made them arrest me at a 
private university.

1120
00:40:56,350 --> 00:40:59,290
They do have the,
they do have the legal right to,

1121
00:40:59,291 --> 00:41:02,440
to band whoever they want.
It just demonstrates how ridiculous they

1122
00:41:02,441 --> 00:41:04,960
are that they're willing to arrest me.
And the fact that again,

1123
00:41:04,961 --> 00:41:09,670
that they're taking everyone from you to
milo,

1124
00:41:10,330 --> 00:41:13,030
it's like that's showing real 
intolerance.

1125
00:41:13,031 --> 00:41:15,880
Cause it's not just a sleep.
It's not just [inaudible].

1126
00:41:16,690 --> 00:41:18,970
It's people that disagree wildly on 
things.

1127
00:41:19,030 --> 00:41:20,620
Exactly.
Well they except,

1128
00:41:20,621 --> 00:41:23,680
except if they are remotely construed as
right wing.

1129
00:41:23,910 --> 00:41:24,521
Right.
So if you're,

1130
00:41:24,521 --> 00:41:25,354
if you're in a,
if you're a terrorist convicted in 

1131
00:41:26,921 --> 00:41:28,040
Israel,
you can speak at a,

1132
00:41:28,110 --> 00:41:30,610
they had one speaker in 2014 I think at 
Depaul.

1133
00:41:30,850 --> 00:41:31,683
So if you,
so you have to be within a certain 

1134
00:41:33,740 --> 00:41:34,573
spectrum,
but they refused to even acknowledge a 

1135
00:41:35,601 --> 00:41:36,434
spectrum.
Right.

1136
00:41:36,590 --> 00:41:38,300
Although depaul actually did write 
depaul,

1137
00:41:38,301 --> 00:41:39,134
depaul came out later and they,
and they tried to distinguish kind of 

1138
00:41:40,731 --> 00:41:42,590
what I say from what Milo says,
which is kind of interesting.

1139
00:41:42,591 --> 00:41:45,110
But that didn't change their behavior 
enough to actually let me speak.

1140
00:41:45,240 --> 00:41:45,871
Yeah.
All right,

1141
00:41:45,871 --> 00:41:47,550
so let's,
let's just do the Milo thing quick.

1142
00:41:47,551 --> 00:41:48,750
I don't want to,
I don't want to dwell on it,

1143
00:41:48,751 --> 00:41:50,130
but,
but so many people ask.

1144
00:41:50,131 --> 00:41:52,770
So for the record that you sitting here 
right now,

1145
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:55,170
I will fully say what I've said many 
times on twitter,

1146
00:41:55,171 --> 00:41:59,250
which is that my low had the original 
idea of doing it.

1147
00:41:59,490 --> 00:42:01,830
He sent an email to our team,
said,

1148
00:42:01,831 --> 00:42:03,780
let's do this debate.
Me and Ben,

1149
00:42:03,781 --> 00:42:06,150
table moderate,
you immediately responded,

1150
00:42:06,151 --> 00:42:07,500
yes,
you gave dates.

1151
00:42:07,860 --> 00:42:10,920
And then Milo basically dipped out that 
says the truth.

1152
00:42:10,921 --> 00:42:11,754
As much as I know it

1153
00:42:13,490 --> 00:42:13,870
and say,
no,

1154
00:42:13,870 --> 00:42:14,830
that's exactly right.
And so,

1155
00:42:14,831 --> 00:42:15,664
and then went around the country 
proclaiming that I had chicken down and 

1156
00:42:18,550 --> 00:42:23,230
trying to derive this rivalry with me 
that I could not care less about.

1157
00:42:23,320 --> 00:42:26,030
Like Milo,
I wish nothing but success to,

1158
00:42:26,031 --> 00:42:28,090
to my low based on the good things he 
does.

1159
00:42:28,091 --> 00:42:28,924
I hope nothing but failure for him,
for bad things that he does just like 

1160
00:42:30,851 --> 00:42:33,640
anybody else.
And it's,

1161
00:42:33,641 --> 00:42:35,350
and you know,
as in,

1162
00:42:35,620 --> 00:42:36,453
you know,
I'm not going to play Lucy and the 

1163
00:42:37,481 --> 00:42:40,060
football with him and he ducked out.
He chickened out.

1164
00:42:40,330 --> 00:42:41,620
And uh,
and I mean,

1165
00:42:41,621 --> 00:42:42,454
look,
the fact is that even the fact I was 

1166
00:42:43,811 --> 00:42:44,644
willing to do it in the first place 
after he was tweeting pictures of me as 

1167
00:42:46,300 --> 00:42:48,850
a black baby on the day that my son was 
born because I'm a cock,

1168
00:42:49,430 --> 00:42:50,500
it was,
was a bit generous.

1169
00:42:50,501 --> 00:42:53,050
But then now that I'm not gonna,
I'm not gonna play that game.

1170
00:42:53,080 --> 00:42:53,850
That's not my game.

1171
00:42:53,850 --> 00:42:54,683
And the thing is,
I genuinely liked both of you and I 

1172
00:42:56,761 --> 00:42:58,290
think we could have done something 
really good.

1173
00:42:58,291 --> 00:43:00,300
I have my own coming back in in 
February.

1174
00:43:00,420 --> 00:43:01,920
I think that,
my guess is that the ground,

1175
00:43:01,950 --> 00:43:03,390
the ground is a little too scorch.
Yeah.

1176
00:43:03,391 --> 00:43:04,320
I'm not,
I'm not interested.

1177
00:43:05,110 --> 00:43:05,721
Yeah,
okay.

1178
00:43:05,721 --> 00:43:06,554
Again,
I'm not interested in doing the Charlie 

1179
00:43:07,220 --> 00:43:09,860
Brown lucy routine so that he can go 
around the country proclaiming that he's

1180
00:43:09,861 --> 00:43:11,210
brave after having checked it out.
Yeah.

1181
00:43:11,330 --> 00:43:13,010
And for the record,
when he comes in in February,

1182
00:43:13,200 --> 00:43:16,100
I'll say the exact same thing to him and
he can say,

1183
00:43:16,150 --> 00:43:17,180
well,
that's fine.

1184
00:43:17,240 --> 00:43:18,560
That's fine.
Um,

1185
00:43:18,620 --> 00:43:19,453
all right.
I'll be very sophisticated in British 

1186
00:43:19,941 --> 00:43:21,450
stuff.
Uh,

1187
00:43:21,690 --> 00:43:22,523
the alt right thing.
Now I have done a couple of videos on 

1188
00:43:24,711 --> 00:43:26,630
the alt right.
I general feeling,

1189
00:43:26,900 --> 00:43:29,360
although I think something is changing 
now that trump is in power,

1190
00:43:29,600 --> 00:43:31,460
is that for the months leading up to the
election,

1191
00:43:31,700 --> 00:43:32,533
this was mostly a bunch of shit posters.
It was mostly a bunch of anonymous four 

1192
00:43:36,531 --> 00:43:41,531
Chan and reddit people.
It was not really white supremacists and

1193
00:43:41,661 --> 00:43:42,494
neo Nazis.
There were some of these people in the 

1194
00:43:43,581 --> 00:43:44,414
mix of it,
but it was just people who were home in 

1195
00:43:46,821 --> 00:43:50,240
their basements or wherever that were 
tweeting at people in power media,

1196
00:43:50,241 --> 00:43:52,100
people,
politicians to upset everybody,

1197
00:43:52,101 --> 00:43:54,200
to get them retweeted,
to get everyone to show,

1198
00:43:54,201 --> 00:43:55,640
I'm such a victim,
look at me,

1199
00:43:55,641 --> 00:43:57,560
look what's happening to me online.
I'm separate.

1200
00:43:58,070 --> 00:44:00,740
And basically what I've said is if we 
deal with some of these issues,

1201
00:44:00,741 --> 00:44:02,390
honestly,
like immigration or Islam,

1202
00:44:02,391 --> 00:44:03,224
Islam or something,
that's how we'll defang some of the 

1203
00:44:06,530 --> 00:44:09,470
rhetoric around all this stuff.
And so I think there's truth to that.

1204
00:44:09,500 --> 00:44:10,333
Now.
I think it's starting to shift a little 

1205
00:44:11,571 --> 00:44:14,000
bit now that,
that trump won the election,

1206
00:44:14,240 --> 00:44:14,841
right?
No,

1207
00:44:14,841 --> 00:44:15,674
I think,
I think there's truth to that.

1208
00:44:15,680 --> 00:44:16,513
So what I've distinguished in interviews
or talking about this is the outright 

1209
00:44:20,031 --> 00:44:23,730
philosophers and promulgators Milo's a 
problem we had of the alt right.

1210
00:44:23,920 --> 00:44:25,280
Uh,
and he denies head,

1211
00:44:25,281 --> 00:44:26,750
but he likes to play the clown nose off 
clown nose,

1212
00:44:26,751 --> 00:44:29,200
offer a teen and clown nose on clown 
nose offers him with the outright.

1213
00:44:29,270 --> 00:44:29,721
Yes.
I'm not,

1214
00:44:29,721 --> 00:44:30,554
I'm not really a member of the outright.
I just write stories giving they're 

1215
00:44:32,610 --> 00:44:33,790
expressing their viewpoints.
Uh Huh.

1216
00:44:34,260 --> 00:44:35,030
Um,
but it's,

1217
00:44:35,030 --> 00:44:36,240
uh,
but the,

1218
00:44:36,241 --> 00:44:37,074
the piece that he wrote for,
for Breitbart about the outright is a 

1219
00:44:39,421 --> 00:44:41,460
really definitive piece about what the 
alt right is.

1220
00:44:41,790 --> 00:44:42,623
Uh,
and I think that for the most part it's 

1221
00:44:43,530 --> 00:44:44,620
pretty accurate.
Uh,

1222
00:44:44,720 --> 00:44:45,130
there,
the,

1223
00:44:45,130 --> 00:44:45,963
the outright philosophy isn't a lot of 
people who consider themselves outright 

1224
00:44:47,881 --> 00:44:49,710
right or not technically outright right?
They are,

1225
00:44:49,711 --> 00:44:50,670
as you say,
shit posters,

1226
00:44:50,671 --> 00:44:50,850
right?

1227
00:44:50,850 --> 00:44:51,683
There are people who have been drawn in 
by the idea that they're being 

1228
00:44:53,071 --> 00:44:55,620
politically incorrect and they're 
violating taboos.

1229
00:44:55,621 --> 00:44:56,454
And it's kind of fun to do that.
And it's very teenagery and all this 

1230
00:44:57,841 --> 00:44:58,880
kind of stuff.
Um,

1231
00:44:59,020 --> 00:45:00,990
the people who are actually hardcore old
writers,

1232
00:45:01,470 --> 00:45:02,303
people who,
Milo,

1233
00:45:02,490 --> 00:45:04,590
he knows that her philosophy and he 
talked about it and that piece,

1234
00:45:04,591 --> 00:45:05,050
right?
The people,

1235
00:45:05,050 --> 00:45:07,320
the Richard Spencers and the jury,
Taylor's and all those groups,

1236
00:45:07,380 --> 00:45:08,880
those people out,
our actual honest to God,

1237
00:45:08,881 --> 00:45:09,714
white supremacists.
And there's a line in that piece where 

1238
00:45:10,711 --> 00:45:11,544
he talks about about civil as Western 
civilization being inseparable from 

1239
00:45:15,301 --> 00:45:16,230
ethnicity,
uh,

1240
00:45:16,290 --> 00:45:18,440
which is white supremacy,
right?

1241
00:45:18,450 --> 00:45:20,010
That that is definition of white 
supremacy.

1242
00:45:20,160 --> 00:45:22,860
So it's a,
so that's the philosophy,

1243
00:45:23,190 --> 00:45:25,310
but a lot of people consider themselves 
outright,

1244
00:45:25,440 --> 00:45:26,273
had been dragged into that by people who
have been inaccurate in their 

1245
00:45:27,781 --> 00:45:28,770
definitions of the alt right.

1246
00:45:29,040 --> 00:45:30,450
So instead of just saying,
okay,

1247
00:45:30,451 --> 00:45:31,284
there's the,
the people who actually believe this 

1248
00:45:32,341 --> 00:45:33,174
white supremacist crap,
and then they're a bunch of people who 

1249
00:45:34,381 --> 00:45:37,650
are just posting stupid stuff online to 
get a rise out of people.

1250
00:45:38,220 --> 00:45:39,053
They had conflate the two.
And then what's even worse is that you 

1251
00:45:41,491 --> 00:45:42,324
get people who are legit,
you know conservatives who don't know 

1252
00:45:44,431 --> 00:45:47,490
what the alt right is.
And so they assume that everybody who is

1253
00:45:47,491 --> 00:45:48,324
antiestablishment is outright.
And so that gives them a number that 

1254
00:45:50,881 --> 00:45:52,470
they don't actually hold.
Right.

1255
00:45:52,471 --> 00:45:54,860
The number of people who are definitely,
who are really outright,

1256
00:45:54,890 --> 00:45:58,740
like the people who actually believe in 
white nationalism or white superiority,

1257
00:45:58,980 --> 00:46:01,230
that's a really small number of people.
It really is.

1258
00:46:01,350 --> 00:46:04,410
And then they've built themselves out.
They've kind of built this,

1259
00:46:04,411 --> 00:46:05,520
this,
there's the,

1260
00:46:05,521 --> 00:46:06,840
there's the core and then there's the 
chaff.

1261
00:46:06,841 --> 00:46:10,770
They've built this kind of large chaff 
sphere around themselves.

1262
00:46:11,100 --> 00:46:11,933
And one of the,
I think tasks we have is to try and 

1263
00:46:14,851 --> 00:46:16,080
separate the core from the chaff and 
say,

1264
00:46:16,081 --> 00:46:16,950
okay,
you know,

1265
00:46:17,100 --> 00:46:18,510
all you people who are anti 
establishment,

1266
00:46:18,540 --> 00:46:20,100
listen,
I'm antiestablishment too.

1267
00:46:20,130 --> 00:46:22,440
I think Mitch Mcconnell is terrible.
I was not a fan of Paul Ryan,

1268
00:46:22,740 --> 00:46:24,630
but that's not the same thing as being 
alt right.

1269
00:46:24,930 --> 00:46:25,763
And so,
you know what I'm fearful of is the 

1270
00:46:27,871 --> 00:46:31,350
winks and nods to the actual outright.
Like I think when I say winks and nods,

1271
00:46:31,351 --> 00:46:32,970
and I've been saying this for awhile,
like when,

1272
00:46:32,971 --> 00:46:35,780
when Donald Trump was on tv and he was 
asking about the KKK,

1273
00:46:36,010 --> 00:46:37,890
I don't Kkk,
I've never heard of them.

1274
00:46:37,891 --> 00:46:39,390
What are you talking?
Okay.

1275
00:46:39,391 --> 00:46:41,100
Like we all know that you've heard of 
the KKK.

1276
00:46:41,110 --> 00:46:41,943
We all know you've heard of David Duke.
You're your microphone didn't 

1277
00:46:43,501 --> 00:46:44,370
malfunction.
You were,

1278
00:46:44,371 --> 00:46:45,204
you'd be like you,
it was two days before the Louisiana 

1279
00:46:46,861 --> 00:46:49,290
primary and you didn't want to alienate 
voters who thought you were going to win

1280
00:46:49,291 --> 00:46:50,280
in the Louisiana primary.

1281
00:46:50,280 --> 00:46:50,640
Right?
That's,

1282
00:46:50,640 --> 00:46:51,830
that's what was going on there.
That was,

1283
00:46:51,840 --> 00:46:52,673
that was a wink and a nod,
right when Donald Trump was retweeting 

1284
00:46:54,870 --> 00:46:57,390
white white nationalist accounts,
right.

1285
00:46:57,391 --> 00:46:58,224
When he's,
when he's granting legitimacy to some 

1286
00:47:01,980 --> 00:47:05,400
kind of,
I wouldn't say fully outright figures,

1287
00:47:05,401 --> 00:47:07,140
but people who are very popular with the
alt right,

1288
00:47:07,141 --> 00:47:09,060
the Alex Jones crowd.
Uh,

1289
00:47:09,120 --> 00:47:09,953
that's,
that's the kind of stuff where you're 

1290
00:47:10,921 --> 00:47:13,550
getting into kind of a gray area.
Um,

1291
00:47:13,620 --> 00:47:17,000
but the do I do,
I think they're an upward moe,

1292
00:47:17,010 --> 00:47:18,360
an upwardly mobile threat.
I think.

1293
00:47:18,361 --> 00:47:19,194
No,
because I think their philosophy is so 

1294
00:47:20,460 --> 00:47:22,950
repugnant that most people,
the vast majority of people think that's

1295
00:47:22,951 --> 00:47:23,784
stupid.
But I think it's easy to sucker people 

1296
00:47:24,871 --> 00:47:25,704
into thinking they're all right.
And the game there is you sucker people 

1297
00:47:27,481 --> 00:47:30,340
into thinking they're all right and then
like me attack the outright,

1298
00:47:30,580 --> 00:47:31,091
then they go,
oh,

1299
00:47:31,091 --> 00:47:33,430
he must be attacking me.
It's like I'm not attacking you.

1300
00:47:33,500 --> 00:47:33,971
Yeah.
Okay.

1301
00:47:33,971 --> 00:47:35,200
So you post a puppy meme,
like,

1302
00:47:35,201 --> 00:47:36,340
okay,
so I think you're stupid,

1303
00:47:36,341 --> 00:47:38,260
but I don't think you're all right.
Right.

1304
00:47:38,261 --> 00:47:40,870
I think,
but as I said before on your show,

1305
00:47:40,871 --> 00:47:41,704
and I got a lot of flack for it,
if you tweet at me something that's 

1306
00:47:43,601 --> 00:47:44,434
indistinguishable from David Duke,
it's not my responsibility to determine 

1307
00:47:47,021 --> 00:47:48,520
your motive.
Like it's a tweet.

1308
00:47:48,550 --> 00:47:49,383
I'm going to treat that the same way 
that I would treat treated tweet from 

1309
00:47:50,531 --> 00:47:51,364
David Duke.
It's an idiotic tweet from an idiotic 

1310
00:47:52,841 --> 00:47:53,810
person.
So how much

1311
00:47:54,220 --> 00:47:56,450
then is just related to the Internet 
culture in general?

1312
00:47:56,470 --> 00:47:59,380
Because so when I saw the,
was it spencer in DC?

1313
00:47:59,381 --> 00:48:00,214
Yes.

1314
00:48:01,080 --> 00:48:02,060
Yeah.
Okay.

1315
00:48:02,110 --> 00:48:04,780
So I've had a family members on both 
sides.

1316
00:48:04,781 --> 00:48:06,730
My Dad's side and my mom's side die in 
the Holocaust.

1317
00:48:06,731 --> 00:48:09,580
I suspect you probably did as well.
Um,

1318
00:48:09,640 --> 00:48:12,520
so I don't take kindly to that in any 
way.

1319
00:48:12,880 --> 00:48:13,930
Uh,
I don't like it.

1320
00:48:13,960 --> 00:48:17,260
I'd rather not see neo Nazis and all of 
that stuff.

1321
00:48:17,410 --> 00:48:18,243
However,
I saw that and my thought was these are 

1322
00:48:20,381 --> 00:48:24,310
200 losers.
And unfortunately we've now,

1323
00:48:24,311 --> 00:48:27,880
the media will now run this.
It'll be on CNN all day long.

1324
00:48:28,090 --> 00:48:30,400
Everyone will keep talking about it,
talking about and talking about people.

1325
00:48:30,670 --> 00:48:31,810
Tell me all the time,
talk about it.

1326
00:48:31,811 --> 00:48:32,950
Talk about it more.
Yeah.

1327
00:48:32,951 --> 00:48:33,784
And it's like all we're doing is 
inflating this thing that these people 

1328
00:48:37,091 --> 00:48:39,820
have always existed.
Hate is always going to exist.

1329
00:48:39,821 --> 00:48:42,850
I can't make every person Niagara eight 
black people,

1330
00:48:42,851 --> 00:48:45,970
I can't make every person not a juice or
gay people or whatever it is.

1331
00:48:46,170 --> 00:48:47,710
It's,
it's human nature.

1332
00:48:47,711 --> 00:48:49,030
You may not like it,
but it's human nature.

1333
00:48:49,120 --> 00:48:51,100
And I think we're,
we're inflating this stuff.

1334
00:48:51,210 --> 00:48:51,740
Yeah.
So I,

1335
00:48:51,740 --> 00:48:52,573
I agree with that and I've,
and I've argued against sort of the 

1336
00:48:54,571 --> 00:48:55,980
inflation,
but by the same token,

1337
00:48:56,220 --> 00:48:57,053
I think that there's been empowerment of
the fellow travelers and people who the 

1338
00:48:59,041 --> 00:49:03,230
outright sees a sort of ideological 
forebears people like Pat Buchanan and I

1339
00:49:03,240 --> 00:49:04,073
mentioned Alex Jones.
Alex Jones probably isn't technically 

1340
00:49:05,341 --> 00:49:06,950
all right or wouldn't consider himself 
thoughts,

1341
00:49:06,990 --> 00:49:08,790
but when he talks about Jewish influence
in the media,

1342
00:49:08,791 --> 00:49:09,624
in his rand's,
he's obviously granting them a lot of 

1343
00:49:11,340 --> 00:49:12,173
kind of credibility and,
and he's giving them some ammunition to 

1344
00:49:15,901 --> 00:49:18,810
feel like they have a allies.
There are a lot of people who seem to be

1345
00:49:18,811 --> 00:49:19,644
okay with,
with benefiting from the shit posters 

1346
00:49:21,631 --> 00:49:22,860
and the,
and the alt right groups.

1347
00:49:23,110 --> 00:49:24,450
Uh,
if they can gain traffic.

1348
00:49:24,451 --> 00:49:25,830
That was my main critical Breitbart by 
the way.

1349
00:49:25,831 --> 00:49:26,664
Like when I said that,
that Steve Bannon was appealing to the 

1350
00:49:27,961 --> 00:49:28,290
alt right.

1351
00:49:28,290 --> 00:49:29,123
That's because he called himself the 
Plat Breitbart a platform for the alt 

1352
00:49:31,491 --> 00:49:33,540
right.
And the idea was that he was,

1353
00:49:33,660 --> 00:49:34,493
and this is always been my critique of 
Steve and the left doesn't understand 

1354
00:49:36,540 --> 00:49:38,550
anything remotely approaching 
moderation.

1355
00:49:38,730 --> 00:49:39,563
So my critique of Steven Breitbart was 
always that what had happened was that 

1356
00:49:43,021 --> 00:49:46,440
Breitbart had been moved and direction 
when they were willing to pander to some

1357
00:49:46,441 --> 00:49:47,274
of the worst people on Earth.
My posting material that appealed to 

1358
00:49:48,961 --> 00:49:50,240
those people.
Uh,

1359
00:49:50,250 --> 00:49:53,400
and,
and that demonstrates to me a tremendous

1360
00:49:53,401 --> 00:49:54,234
will for power from,
from Steve and a willingness to work 

1361
00:49:56,791 --> 00:49:58,950
with anyone to get there.
And that's my main critique.

1362
00:49:59,240 --> 00:50:00,690
And the left immediately sees done,
oh,

1363
00:50:00,691 --> 00:50:02,310
well he must be an antisemite.
It must be a racist.

1364
00:50:02,311 --> 00:50:03,270
And it's like,
no,

1365
00:50:03,720 --> 00:50:04,471
that's what I said.
I said,

1366
00:50:04,471 --> 00:50:05,304
he's an opportunist.
You've gone out of your way to say that 

1367
00:50:06,751 --> 00:50:08,040
you don't think he's in it,
but no,

1368
00:50:08,041 --> 00:50:09,120
I don't.
I don't have any evidence at all.

1369
00:50:09,121 --> 00:50:10,250
But Steve's an antisemite.
Yeah,

1370
00:50:10,290 --> 00:50:11,730
no,
I think Steve's an asshole.

1371
00:50:11,731 --> 00:50:13,010
But I don't think she's an asset to 
them.

1372
00:50:13,970 --> 00:50:15,470
Right.
So what do you make of that then?

1373
00:50:15,471 --> 00:50:18,950
So you worked with the guy who worked,
he was technically your boss,

1374
00:50:18,951 --> 00:50:19,450
right?
And you're like,

1375
00:50:19,450 --> 00:50:20,540
yeah,
and he's chairman of the company.

1376
00:50:20,541 --> 00:50:22,190
Yeah.
So he was technically your boss.

1377
00:50:22,191 --> 00:50:24,110
You have no evidence that he's an 
antisemite,

1378
00:50:24,150 --> 00:50:25,580
right.
You as the,

1379
00:50:25,581 --> 00:50:27,560
as the Adl said,
you were the number attack,

1380
00:50:27,620 --> 00:50:32,450
a recipient of antisemetic abuse online.
So you are aware of the idea of it.

1381
00:50:32,451 --> 00:50:33,284
For sure.

1382
00:50:33,730 --> 00:50:34,563
And I will say it again,
there are people who probably will get 

1383
00:50:35,561 --> 00:50:36,790
this following.
So for example,

1384
00:50:36,791 --> 00:50:37,624
when Milo was banned from twitter at my 
Auntie's medic feed went down 70% 

1385
00:50:40,151 --> 00:50:41,800
immediately.
Really?

1386
00:50:41,860 --> 00:50:43,240
Oh yeah.
And so,

1387
00:50:43,241 --> 00:50:44,950
but see the question,
to know where those his,

1388
00:50:44,951 --> 00:50:45,784
where those actual antisemites or shit 
posters in all likelihood they're shit 

1389
00:50:47,741 --> 00:50:48,250
posters.
Yeah.

1390
00:50:48,250 --> 00:50:49,083
I would guess that 90% of them are.
But what you are doing is you're 

1391
00:50:51,851 --> 00:50:54,280
mainstreaming the idea that this sort of
rhetoric is okay.

1392
00:50:54,400 --> 00:50:56,140
Because in,
this was always my critique of,

1393
00:50:56,200 --> 00:50:57,033
of sort of the,
the notion that it's the same thing to 

1394
00:50:59,051 --> 00:51:01,630
be politically incorrect as it is to 
just be a bad person.

1395
00:51:02,110 --> 00:51:03,910
Right.
Like if it like political,

1396
00:51:03,980 --> 00:51:04,813
the,
the whole point of fighting political 

1397
00:51:05,261 --> 00:51:06,094
correctness is so you can say true 
things in order to promulgate better 

1398
00:51:08,021 --> 00:51:09,400
ideas.
It's not,

1399
00:51:09,700 --> 00:51:10,533
you can then you're not doing it in the 
world any good by just shouting the n 

1400
00:51:12,821 --> 00:51:13,230
word.

1401
00:51:13,230 --> 00:51:13,690
Yeah.
Right.

1402
00:51:13,690 --> 00:51:16,510
Not doing me any good or the world any 
good by just tweeting people pictures of

1403
00:51:16,511 --> 00:51:17,610
black kids.
Cause you're a cock.

1404
00:51:17,710 --> 00:51:18,190
Yeah.
What,

1405
00:51:18,190 --> 00:51:18,640
what,
how,

1406
00:51:18,640 --> 00:51:19,473
how is the world become a better place 
because it has the dialogue become any 

1407
00:51:21,521 --> 00:51:23,410
better because of that.
You certainly have the right to do it.

1408
00:51:23,440 --> 00:51:24,760
I'm not arguing.
You don't have the right to do it.

1409
00:51:24,761 --> 00:51:25,594
Yeah.
But you also have the right slap 

1410
00:51:26,411 --> 00:51:28,060
yourself in the face of the frying pan.
You know,

1411
00:51:28,061 --> 00:51:28,894
that's the,
you have the right to do lots of stupid 

1412
00:51:29,981 --> 00:51:30,460
thing.
Yeah.

1413
00:51:30,460 --> 00:51:31,293
The question is there are people who 
aren't making the affirmative case that 

1414
00:51:32,921 --> 00:51:33,754
this is making the country a better 
place and making the dialogue more open 

1415
00:51:36,100 --> 00:51:36,933
when in reality what you're actually 
doing is you're breeding the resistance 

1416
00:51:39,161 --> 00:51:40,210
to the dialogue.
Right,

1417
00:51:40,211 --> 00:51:40,720
because then,

1418
00:51:40,720 --> 00:51:41,610
yeah,
look,

1419
00:51:41,611 --> 00:51:42,444
I guess what those people would argue is
that the system has become so rigid and 

1420
00:51:45,571 --> 00:51:48,770
so afraid of everything and every idea 
that the only way you,

1421
00:51:48,850 --> 00:51:49,683
I mean,
I think my actually said this to me on 

1422
00:51:50,790 --> 00:51:51,623
my show,
which was a year before the election 

1423
00:51:53,190 --> 00:51:56,360
that this was the only way we were going
to break any of this,

1424
00:51:56,500 --> 00:51:57,850
but even Milo knows he's lying.
Yeah.

1425
00:51:57,880 --> 00:52:00,460
Next one mile is on.
Ask Him one question if he thinks that's

1426
00:52:00,461 --> 00:52:01,870
true,
ask him to say the n word on your show.

1427
00:52:02,920 --> 00:52:04,690
That's the most rigid taboo in American 
society.

1428
00:52:04,870 --> 00:52:05,703
Asked me to say the n word.
If he really believes that all taboos 

1429
00:52:06,881 --> 00:52:10,330
oughta be broken because taboos are 
worthy of being broken,

1430
00:52:10,331 --> 00:52:11,440
and then we have to break down the 
system.

1431
00:52:11,680 --> 00:52:13,300
Ask Him if he has the ball sitting on 
word on your show.

1432
00:52:13,690 --> 00:52:15,220
I will do that.
I guarantee you,

1433
00:52:15,221 --> 00:52:15,971
he says no.
All right,

1434
00:52:15,971 --> 00:52:16,804
so I'm going to guess that we can't 
solve the entire alt right thing right 

1435
00:52:19,181 --> 00:52:20,014
here,
but I think something we can possibly 

1436
00:52:21,401 --> 00:52:22,234
solve is the media question related to 
all of this because mainstream media is 

1437
00:52:26,140 --> 00:52:28,540
absolutely crumbling.
Everyone knows it.

1438
00:52:28,570 --> 00:52:29,403
Yeah.
When I was on with you on election 

1439
00:52:30,760 --> 00:52:32,860
night,
what I kept saying was we've watched the

1440
00:52:32,861 --> 00:52:36,670
mainstream media slowly crumble as the 
online media has risen,

1441
00:52:36,671 --> 00:52:37,504
and I think as of the election,
it's actually starting to tilt and now 

1442
00:52:41,380 --> 00:52:42,213
the online guys are kind of winning,
which is why you're seeing all this 

1443
00:52:43,571 --> 00:52:45,260
stuff about fake news.
Not to say that,

1444
00:52:45,261 --> 00:52:47,410
and some people online are a bushing out
fake news.

1445
00:52:47,411 --> 00:52:48,244
I get that.
They are,

1446
00:52:48,640 --> 00:52:51,280
but what do you think first of the,
of the meme of fake news,

1447
00:52:51,281 --> 00:52:52,114
it seems pretty obvious to me,
although I don't know who the full 

1448
00:52:54,491 --> 00:52:55,324
conspiracy behind it,
that someone in power is pushing out 

1449
00:52:58,301 --> 00:53:00,010
this idea because they lost control.

1450
00:53:00,100 --> 00:53:00,381
Yeah,
I mean,

1451
00:53:00,381 --> 00:53:01,214
I don't,
I don't think it's a conspiracy so much 

1452
00:53:01,661 --> 00:53:03,640
as somebody says,
there's one story that comes out,

1453
00:53:03,641 --> 00:53:04,474
right.
And fake news and everybody sees is on 

1454
00:53:05,231 --> 00:53:05,471
it.
Right.

1455
00:53:05,471 --> 00:53:07,480
Which is usually how I like being in the
right way.

1456
00:53:07,610 --> 00:53:08,720
Media works.
It's,

1457
00:53:08,730 --> 00:53:09,521
it's,
it's like,

1458
00:53:09,521 --> 00:53:10,450
it's a,
it's a,

1459
00:53:10,480 --> 00:53:12,200
you know,
to sharks grom like it's,

1460
00:53:12,201 --> 00:53:12,660
it,
the,

1461
00:53:12,660 --> 00:53:14,290
the term is in the water.
All the sharks come.

1462
00:53:14,300 --> 00:53:15,670
So somebody says fake news,
they go,

1463
00:53:15,671 --> 00:53:16,504
ah,
that's a great excuse for why Hillary 

1464
00:53:17,770 --> 00:53:20,070
Clinton lost because everybody believed 
all these fake things right now

1465
00:53:20,590 --> 00:53:22,220
mirasee of basically lazy.

1466
00:53:22,740 --> 00:53:23,520
Yeah,
exactly.

1467
00:53:23,520 --> 00:53:24,870
That's exactly right.
That's exactly right.

1468
00:53:24,871 --> 00:53:26,430
And think that,
that it's,

1469
00:53:26,780 --> 00:53:27,613
again,
that's not to say there isn't such a 

1470
00:53:28,141 --> 00:53:29,190
thing as fake news.
There is,

1471
00:53:29,191 --> 00:53:30,560
I mean,
there are a lot of stupid headlines that

1472
00:53:30,561 --> 00:53:33,650
glow around that are not true and that 
we spend time to banking,

1473
00:53:33,690 --> 00:53:35,370
you know,
from the right and from the left,

1474
00:53:35,371 --> 00:53:38,250
things that things that are just 
patently false.

1475
00:53:38,440 --> 00:53:40,040
Um,
and it's,

1476
00:53:40,060 --> 00:53:43,620
and trump himself was a rather large 
promulgator of things that were false.

1477
00:53:43,980 --> 00:53:46,290
And it was important to try and debunk 
those.

1478
00:53:46,291 --> 00:53:47,124
But the media had so shredded a total 
credibility that it couldn't fairly 

1479
00:53:49,111 --> 00:53:49,944
debunk any of this stuff because they 
were saying things that were false were 

1480
00:53:51,991 --> 00:53:52,824
true for years.
And then along comes trump and he 

1481
00:53:55,020 --> 00:53:55,853
basically runs a post truth campaigns.
You have two candidates running 

1482
00:53:57,451 --> 00:53:58,284
post-truth campaigns,
the media insisting that only one is 

1483
00:53:59,911 --> 00:54:01,140
running a post truth campaign.

1484
00:54:01,380 --> 00:54:02,850
And then everybody going,
wait a second,

1485
00:54:02,851 --> 00:54:03,684
like you don't get to be the arbiters of
truth because you blew all your 

1486
00:54:05,371 --> 00:54:07,530
credibility a long time ago.
Well,

1487
00:54:07,531 --> 00:54:09,480
the problem is that now no one's an 
arbiter for truth.

1488
00:54:09,481 --> 00:54:10,590
So I,
the,

1489
00:54:10,600 --> 00:54:12,660
the media certainly wasn't.
So I'm glad to see them come down.

1490
00:54:12,680 --> 00:54:13,513
Yeah.
What I would like to see take its place 

1491
00:54:15,090 --> 00:54:15,923
is okay,
now it's honestly analyze what's true 

1492
00:54:17,341 --> 00:54:20,130
and what's not true as opposed to what 
serves our interests in what,

1493
00:54:20,131 --> 00:54:20,964
what doesn't.
So The Washington Post called me 

1494
00:54:21,691 --> 00:54:22,524
recently and they asked if you're trying
to determine whether a news source is 

1495
00:54:25,111 --> 00:54:27,150
credible or not,
what are sort of some quick keys.

1496
00:54:27,180 --> 00:54:27,991
Yeah.
And I said,

1497
00:54:27,991 --> 00:54:28,824
well,
the easiest thing is are they open with 

1498
00:54:30,841 --> 00:54:33,690
their bias and do they run stories that 
counter their bias,

1499
00:54:34,140 --> 00:54:34,591
right?
If their,

1500
00:54:34,591 --> 00:54:37,950
if their news outlet and they only run 
leftwing stories and there are left wing

1501
00:54:37,951 --> 00:54:39,180
sites,
they only run leftwing stories.

1502
00:54:39,180 --> 00:54:41,700
They never run a story that counters 
anything that they say,

1503
00:54:42,090 --> 00:54:42,923
then you know,
you should what you should double check 

1504
00:54:44,340 --> 00:54:45,173
for sure.
They're probably just a propaganda 

1505
00:54:46,771 --> 00:54:47,820
outlet.
But if they're a site,

1506
00:54:47,821 --> 00:54:49,980
like I think the Washington Post 
actually better than New York Times this

1507
00:54:49,981 --> 00:54:50,814
way.
The New York Times is entirely one 

1508
00:54:52,051 --> 00:54:53,810
perspective.
The Washington Post not,

1509
00:54:53,830 --> 00:54:55,020
not talking bout their opinion 
columnists.

1510
00:54:55,021 --> 00:54:56,370
I'm talking about the news that they 
break.

1511
00:54:56,710 --> 00:54:57,543
Like the Washington Post is actually 
breaking some anti Hillary News in the 

1512
00:54:59,011 --> 00:54:59,770
past,
in the,

1513
00:54:59,770 --> 00:55:01,830
in the last three weeks before the 
election cycle.

1514
00:55:02,070 --> 00:55:02,970
And so,
you know,

1515
00:55:02,971 --> 00:55:04,410
I think it's important to distinguish 
those.

1516
00:55:04,411 --> 00:55:06,150
But um,
yeah,

1517
00:55:06,151 --> 00:55:08,840
I mean when there's no gatekeeper,
the good news is there is no gatekeeper.

1518
00:55:08,850 --> 00:55:10,760
The bad news is there's no gatekeeper.
Yeah.

1519
00:55:11,390 --> 00:55:12,223
It's not a full,
it's not a fully great thing because 

1520
00:55:14,370 --> 00:55:15,203
nothing has emerged yet that act as a,
that and it maybe that's just because 

1521
00:55:19,501 --> 00:55:21,960
we're demanding more of people,
but people have to demand more of it.

1522
00:55:21,961 --> 00:55:23,510
I'm not saying there should be somebody 
who like,

1523
00:55:23,670 --> 00:55:24,830
I'm not the gatekeeper.
You're not there.

1524
00:55:24,860 --> 00:55:27,240
No one is the gatekeeper.
But I my own gatekeeper.

1525
00:55:27,270 --> 00:55:28,103
Right.
I analyze the news for myself and I 

1526
00:55:29,341 --> 00:55:31,440
don't just believe every headline that I
see on facebook.

1527
00:55:31,550 --> 00:55:32,383
Yeah.
And that that I do think is a concern 

1528
00:55:33,421 --> 00:55:34,950
because that's going to polarize the 
news.

1529
00:55:34,951 --> 00:55:37,110
If you're just picking the headlines 
that reinforce your bias.

1530
00:55:37,210 --> 00:55:38,430
Yeah.
Then you're in,

1531
00:55:38,520 --> 00:55:39,353
you're not likely to,
to achieve anything remotely resembling 

1532
00:55:41,311 --> 00:55:41,740
the truth.

1533
00:55:41,740 --> 00:55:42,573
And it almost seems obvious that this is
where we were going to end up because 

1534
00:55:44,650 --> 00:55:46,270
everyone,
this is what everyone does on twitter.

1535
00:55:46,271 --> 00:55:49,450
You cater things to yourself.
I try not to do that,

1536
00:55:49,750 --> 00:55:50,583
but every now and again,
something gets to me to the point where 

1537
00:55:52,011 --> 00:55:54,820
we're like,
I cannot follow this buzzfeed,

1538
00:55:54,821 --> 00:55:55,840
my final Straw.
We,

1539
00:55:55,870 --> 00:55:59,050
I unfollowed them already before that 
gains thing.

1540
00:55:59,290 --> 00:56:00,041
But I was like,
wow,

1541
00:56:00,041 --> 00:56:02,080
that's why I am followed this drivel.
But,

1542
00:56:02,110 --> 00:56:04,030
but even that,
there's a risk in that.

1543
00:56:04,140 --> 00:56:07,600
Yeah.
By slowly just filtering everything into

1544
00:56:07,601 --> 00:56:09,150
your own little ideology that

1545
00:56:09,200 --> 00:56:11,240
the best indicator is if somebody is 
hated by both sides,

1546
00:56:11,241 --> 00:56:13,670
that's a pretty good indicator that 
they're at least baseline honest.

1547
00:56:13,760 --> 00:56:14,640
Yeah.
Right.

1548
00:56:14,690 --> 00:56:15,141
That's,
that's,

1549
00:56:15,141 --> 00:56:17,060
that's like that.
There's a level of honesty.

1550
00:56:17,090 --> 00:56:18,920
And what I mean by that is,
is not,

1551
00:56:18,980 --> 00:56:21,020
you know,
people who are obviously conspiratorial,

1552
00:56:21,021 --> 00:56:21,854
but people who are flack from every side
because they don't please one side all 

1553
00:56:25,991 --> 00:56:27,370
the time.
That's it.

1554
00:56:27,480 --> 00:56:28,970
It's not a foolproof test,
but it's,

1555
00:56:29,200 --> 00:56:31,900
it's an okay test for people who tend to
be more honest.

1556
00:56:32,620 --> 00:56:37,510
So you exist sort of in both worlds.
Do you consider yourself a more,

1557
00:56:37,511 --> 00:56:40,690
more mainstream than no,
I'm kind of straddle it.

1558
00:56:40,691 --> 00:56:41,524
But because you're on Fox a lot and 
you're on CNN a lot me on that often 

1559
00:56:44,951 --> 00:56:46,930
that because they,
because again,

1560
00:56:47,110 --> 00:56:48,850
I have the troublesome quality.
If not,

1561
00:56:48,870 --> 00:56:49,750
they don't know not,
I'm gonna say.

1562
00:56:49,810 --> 00:56:51,130
So it's,
it's a little bit of a problem.

1563
00:56:51,250 --> 00:56:52,480
It's hard for them.
A little.

1564
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:56,470
They'll have me on like I'm on a Fox 
News once every three weeks maybe,

1565
00:56:56,471 --> 00:56:57,304
and I'm on CNN once a month perhaps.
But I'm not like a regular guest on any 

1566
00:57:00,701 --> 00:57:01,534
of these places.
So if they continue to crumble and if 

1567
00:57:03,821 --> 00:57:04,654
the online thing grows,
and as you're saying when there's no 

1568
00:57:06,131 --> 00:57:07,270
gatekeeper,
anyone's in,

1569
00:57:07,271 --> 00:57:10,000
and this is a problem now,
okay.

1570
00:57:10,060 --> 00:57:11,530
As you said,
it can be on us,

1571
00:57:11,560 --> 00:57:13,400
it can be on,
it should have us individually,

1572
00:57:13,640 --> 00:57:16,070
but most people don't have that real 
risk there too.

1573
00:57:16,610 --> 00:57:17,560
People are lazy.
Right.

1574
00:57:17,590 --> 00:57:18,340
And that's,
and that's,

1575
00:57:18,340 --> 00:57:22,480
and so that laziness is going to apply 
except there's not even a shred of,

1576
00:57:22,481 --> 00:57:23,314
of gatekeeping.
So that the problem with a lot of the 

1577
00:57:24,881 --> 00:57:28,960
news that the problem with the fake news
critique is that it's encompassing a lot

1578
00:57:28,961 --> 00:57:29,980
of angles on the news.

1579
00:57:30,040 --> 00:57:31,870
So it's not that the news itself is 
wrong,

1580
00:57:31,871 --> 00:57:32,704
it's angles on it.
It's like how politifact does their 

1581
00:57:33,910 --> 00:57:35,230
analysis.
So politifact,

1582
00:57:35,440 --> 00:57:37,840
we'll say about,
Mitt Romney will say this,

1583
00:57:38,080 --> 00:57:39,310
I,
this happened during the campaign.

1584
00:57:39,520 --> 00:57:42,490
Hillary Clinton said something about she
liked open borders.

1585
00:57:42,491 --> 00:57:43,324
Trump goes on stage and says,
Hillary Clinton says she likes open 

1586
00:57:45,011 --> 00:57:45,844
borders.
Politifact analyzes it and gives it a 

1587
00:57:46,661 --> 00:57:47,940
half true.
Right?

1588
00:57:47,950 --> 00:57:49,720
And he's just repeating exactly what she
said,

1589
00:57:49,760 --> 00:57:50,593
but say,
I bet his implication was that she was 

1590
00:57:51,911 --> 00:57:52,601
saying x,
y,

1591
00:57:52,601 --> 00:57:53,410
and Z.
It's like,

1592
00:57:53,410 --> 00:57:56,170
well now that's your calling his stuff 
fake news,

1593
00:57:56,171 --> 00:57:57,004
but you're the actual fake news because 
you're reading implications that you're 

1594
00:57:59,111 --> 00:58:00,490
reading into him.
Uh,

1595
00:58:00,491 --> 00:58:02,170
once,
once you get into reading other people's

1596
00:58:02,171 --> 00:58:03,370
implications,
uh,

1597
00:58:03,450 --> 00:58:05,380
you ended up in some pretty dicey 
territory.

1598
00:58:05,381 --> 00:58:08,140
But it used to be that when there was 
actual fake news,

1599
00:58:08,141 --> 00:58:09,090
people lost their jobs,
right?

1600
00:58:09,110 --> 00:58:09,943
Like Jason Blair promulgated Fake News 
and lost his job at a publication that 

1601
00:58:13,091 --> 00:58:15,260
we on the right hate the New York Times.
Um,

1602
00:58:15,280 --> 00:58:16,113
but that's it.
There's a difference between that and 

1603
00:58:18,101 --> 00:58:21,250
the angle on the news is wrong or the 
facts of the story,

1604
00:58:21,251 --> 00:58:22,390
right?
And the angle is wrong.

1605
00:58:22,420 --> 00:58:24,790
That's not fake news that you don't like
the angle on the story.

1606
00:58:24,850 --> 00:58:26,190
Right?
And so,

1607
00:58:26,200 --> 00:58:27,890
but the left and the right trade,
it should recognize this.

1608
00:58:27,910 --> 00:58:28,743
Not everything that comes from the 
Washington Post or New York Times is 

1609
00:58:30,551 --> 00:58:31,384
false.
It may just be that the angle that 

1610
00:58:32,531 --> 00:58:36,010
they're giving you is an angle that you 
don't like or an angle that that doesn't

1611
00:58:36,011 --> 00:58:38,290
reflect underlying truth.
It's been out of the facts of the story,

1612
00:58:38,291 --> 00:58:38,921
right?
Yeah.

1613
00:58:38,921 --> 00:58:39,760
The facts of the story.
Right.

1614
00:58:39,761 --> 00:58:41,860
So when the New York Times reports 
something like,

1615
00:58:42,220 --> 00:58:43,053
you know,
a,

1616
00:58:43,060 --> 00:58:46,370
when the New York Times reports a,
the,

1617
00:58:46,371 --> 00:58:47,890
the,
if they'd reported,

1618
00:58:48,040 --> 00:58:48,873
uh,
the hands up don't shoot thing just 

1619
00:58:49,391 --> 00:58:49,990
straight.

1620
00:58:49,990 --> 00:58:51,160
That's,
that's fake news.

1621
00:58:51,161 --> 00:58:54,760
If they report that a black guy was 
killed by a white officer in Ferguson,

1622
00:58:54,761 --> 00:58:55,594
Missouri,
and then they went with proceeds to 

1623
00:58:56,651 --> 00:58:59,020
report it as though it's a serious 
problem all across the country.

1624
00:58:59,110 --> 00:59:00,820
The fake news part of that is their 
angle.

1625
00:59:00,821 --> 00:59:03,010
It's not that a black guy was shot by 
the white guy,

1626
00:59:03,040 --> 00:59:03,721
you know,
in,

1627
00:59:03,721 --> 00:59:04,780
in Ferguson,
Missouri.

1628
00:59:05,050 --> 00:59:05,883
And what I've seen is that people are 
throwing the baby out with the bath 

1629
00:59:07,111 --> 00:59:07,944
water.
So it turns out you can't believe 

1630
00:59:08,711 --> 00:59:11,260
anything in the media says right now you
can't believe their angle.

1631
00:59:11,350 --> 00:59:12,183
You can't believe anything they say.
So if they say Donald Trump hasn't 

1632
00:59:14,291 --> 00:59:17,050
turned over his,
his irs reports,

1633
00:59:17,051 --> 00:59:18,640
he hasn't turned over his,
his tax returns.

1634
00:59:18,820 --> 00:59:19,653
There's a tendency for people to say 
that's fake news is we know that that's 

1635
00:59:22,041 --> 00:59:23,300
not fake news.
That's true.

1636
00:59:23,420 --> 00:59:24,440
You might not think it matters.

1637
00:59:24,470 --> 00:59:28,550
You may have 10 excuses why it's stupid,
but that's not fake news per se.

1638
00:59:28,640 --> 00:59:29,473
When everybody just called stuff they 
disagree with fake news and it's 

1639
00:59:30,861 --> 00:59:31,694
happening now again on both sides.
I've never felt simultaneously less 

1640
00:59:35,391 --> 00:59:38,300
bipartisan and more bipartisan about 
life than I have in the recent past.

1641
00:59:38,760 --> 00:59:39,593
And then again,
that's where I think opportunities 

1642
00:59:40,641 --> 00:59:42,860
because there's so much being reset 
right now.

1643
00:59:43,020 --> 00:59:43,853
W what do you think about the risk of,
it's not coming from the government in 

1644
00:59:47,061 --> 00:59:48,650
some ways,
censorship right now,

1645
00:59:48,710 --> 00:59:49,543
but we know what's happened with prager 
u videos where they've put hard 

1646
00:59:53,061 --> 00:59:54,740
restricted lists.
We've had,

1647
00:59:54,741 --> 00:59:56,900
I did an interview with John Mccain who 
is on,

1648
00:59:57,180 --> 01:00:01,460
who was on cable news every single day 
to decided to demonetize it.

1649
01:00:01,570 --> 01:00:02,530
I mean,
you know,

1650
01:00:02,540 --> 01:00:05,330
I did my interview with Ion Hursey.
I leave 80 monetized.

1651
01:00:05,570 --> 01:00:07,310
Uh,
we have all kinds of stories now.

1652
01:00:07,311 --> 01:00:10,400
If things getting hurt and algorithms,
even my low being banned,

1653
01:00:10,401 --> 01:00:10,940
I get it.

1654
01:00:10,940 --> 01:00:13,760
Twitter can do what they want.
Yeah.

1655
01:00:13,790 --> 01:00:17,180
So all of this stuff is starting to add 
up to something,

1656
01:00:17,181 --> 01:00:18,014
right?
Like there's something cracking down on 

1657
01:00:20,091 --> 01:00:22,340
this new wild west out here.
Yeah,

1658
01:00:22,341 --> 01:00:24,200
for sure.
And I think that you've seen,

1659
01:00:24,310 --> 01:00:25,143
you know,
twitter pay for some of that and in 

1660
01:00:26,241 --> 01:00:27,074
market share,
it's going to be incumbent on people on 

1661
01:00:29,691 --> 01:00:31,640
the right to build an alternative 
structure to these things.

1662
01:00:31,641 --> 01:00:32,474
And that's very expensive.
And people on the right don't tend to 

1663
01:00:34,551 --> 01:00:35,384
think in terms of media too much.
So we invest a lot of money and 

1664
01:00:37,821 --> 01:00:39,630
politicians and we invest a lot of money
and think tanks,

1665
01:00:39,631 --> 01:00:41,000
but we don't invest all that much money 
in media.

1666
01:00:41,001 --> 01:00:43,070
There are a few kinds of people who will
invest money in media,

1667
01:00:43,430 --> 01:00:44,263
but the number of like we gave $100 
million to somebody to start a business 

1668
01:00:47,510 --> 01:00:48,343
very low.
You'll see a lot of people who spend 

1669
01:00:49,131 --> 01:00:50,900
like five to $10 million to start 
something,

1670
01:00:50,960 --> 01:00:51,793
but to start an actual twitter,
you know that that requires enormous 

1671
01:00:55,420 --> 01:00:56,610
expenditures,
the capital.

1672
01:00:56,900 --> 01:00:57,733
And most people on the right don't see 
that as a winning business proposition 

1673
01:00:59,901 --> 01:01:02,900
because people on the right tend to 
think in terms of Roi and twitter hasn't

1674
01:01:02,901 --> 01:01:04,130
even seen an Roi,
right?

1675
01:01:04,190 --> 01:01:07,030
Whatever twitter is losing money still.
So it's,

1676
01:01:07,440 --> 01:01:09,010
and,
and also it's,

1677
01:01:09,040 --> 01:01:10,730
it's hard to go up against the behemoths
like youtube,

1678
01:01:10,731 --> 01:01:11,564
like there've been some attempts to go 
up against against youtube before there 

1679
01:01:13,491 --> 01:01:15,500
is a conservative attempt to go up 
against youtube.

1680
01:01:15,740 --> 01:01:18,650
It didn't do particularly well because 
the problem is that it was billed as the

1681
01:01:18,651 --> 01:01:20,540
conservative attempt to go up against 
youtube.

1682
01:01:20,541 --> 01:01:24,200
It wasn't built as open to everyone.
And so you sort of have to,

1683
01:01:24,250 --> 01:01:27,380
to do the open to everybody routine in 
order to really succeed.

1684
01:01:27,530 --> 01:01:29,090
But you're at it,
you artist systemic disadvantage.

1685
01:01:29,091 --> 01:01:31,580
Youtube has existed for,
for forever.

1686
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:32,833
But again,
youtube is just what the New York Times 

1687
01:01:35,361 --> 01:01:36,860
was 30 years ago.

1688
01:01:36,960 --> 01:01:39,950
The only thing in the space as,
as things progressed,

1689
01:01:39,951 --> 01:01:43,040
I think that you're,
I mean the truth is that youtube is just

1690
01:01:43,041 --> 01:01:47,450
a search service with a lot of big w 
with a lot of servers that provide space

1691
01:01:47,451 --> 01:01:49,280
for the videos.
And I'm,

1692
01:01:49,281 --> 01:01:50,114
I'm old enough to remember when ask 
jeeves was a threat and then Google 

1693
01:01:52,830 --> 01:01:55,550
eight.
So or hotmail,

1694
01:01:55,551 --> 01:01:58,700
I mean like all the prodigy.
That's probably before your time.

1695
01:01:58,730 --> 01:01:59,230
Yeah,
exactly.

1696
01:01:59,230 --> 01:02:00,063
They're all,
all these things look insurmountable at 

1697
01:02:02,331 --> 01:02:04,430
the time and then over time the market 
destroys them,

1698
01:02:04,550 --> 01:02:05,383
right?
Aol was the big thing and now nobody 

1699
01:02:06,741 --> 01:02:07,574
uses say,
oh well,

1700
01:02:07,820 --> 01:02:08,750
I mean the thing is,
look,

1701
01:02:08,780 --> 01:02:09,613
this show is on one of our,
our main method of distribution is 

1702
01:02:12,291 --> 01:02:14,090
youtube.
So I want youtube to work,

1703
01:02:14,190 --> 01:02:16,620
I want to work.
So it,

1704
01:02:17,730 --> 01:02:18,620
and I think that it's,
it's,

1705
01:02:18,621 --> 01:02:19,920
it's a very interesting debate.

1706
01:02:19,920 --> 01:02:20,753
I will say it's an interesting debate 
when people look at private companies 

1707
01:02:22,771 --> 01:02:23,730
like youtube and they say,
well,

1708
01:02:23,731 --> 01:02:25,710
they shouldn't ban anything.
And it's like,

1709
01:02:25,711 --> 01:02:26,544
well,
you can make the argument that youtube 

1710
01:02:27,721 --> 01:02:30,540
should ban certain things like a,
like a graphic terrorist video,

1711
01:02:30,541 --> 01:02:31,490
for example.
Should it,

1712
01:02:31,491 --> 01:02:33,450
do they have the right to do that?
Now for me,

1713
01:02:33,451 --> 01:02:35,640
I'd rather err on the side of everything
goes up,

1714
01:02:35,670 --> 01:02:38,940
then think and then certain things come 
down because I don't really trust people

1715
01:02:38,941 --> 01:02:42,030
in charge of anything to to to do that.
This is why I'm more libertarian,

1716
01:02:42,031 --> 01:02:43,680
even when it comes to things like 
youtube,

1717
01:02:43,920 --> 01:02:45,750
but I see the argument.
I mean not all,

1718
01:02:45,751 --> 01:02:48,030
not all forms of speech are created 
exactly equal,

1719
01:02:48,031 --> 01:02:50,520
at least in their merit.
They are in there in terms of your right

1720
01:02:50,521 --> 01:02:51,354
to say them,
but they're not necessarily in terms of 

1721
01:02:52,351 --> 01:02:53,940
merit.
And when you're in the private sector,

1722
01:02:53,941 --> 01:02:55,950
you're speaking about merit.
You're not just trying to speak in terms

1723
01:02:55,951 --> 01:02:56,690
of right to say.

1724
01:02:56,690 --> 01:02:57,523
Yeah.
Do you think there could be a first 

1725
01:02:59,271 --> 01:03:01,330
amendment issue related to all this?
Now I get it.

1726
01:03:01,331 --> 01:03:01,550
It's

1727
01:03:01,550 --> 01:03:02,383
governor.
When people try and make the utilities 

1728
01:03:03,011 --> 01:03:04,300
argument,
I don't think it's a particularly good

1729
01:03:04,400 --> 01:03:05,810
really,
because to me it seems,

1730
01:03:05,811 --> 01:03:08,960
it seems maybe not fully because we 
don't know what a public utility,

1731
01:03:09,140 --> 01:03:11,330
if there's something else going on.
So it's not utilities.

1732
01:03:11,331 --> 01:03:14,600
But I would argue that the owners of 
these companies,

1733
01:03:14,601 --> 01:03:15,830
the people on the board,
you know,

1734
01:03:15,831 --> 01:03:16,664
Jack Zuckerberg and all these people,
they are so intertwined with our 

1735
01:03:20,391 --> 01:03:22,150
politicians right now.
Yeah.

1736
01:03:22,220 --> 01:03:23,053
That now we actually,
I'm not saying it's directly a first 

1737
01:03:25,791 --> 01:03:28,100
amendment thing,
but there's something there because it's

1738
01:03:28,101 --> 01:03:29,200
almost collusion with it.

1739
01:03:29,360 --> 01:03:30,560
So I,
I agree.

1740
01:03:30,561 --> 01:03:31,394
And the,
and the solution to that is to downsize 

1741
01:03:32,451 --> 01:03:34,220
the government radically,
not to,

1742
01:03:34,250 --> 01:03:35,360
not to have,
you know,

1743
01:03:35,690 --> 01:03:36,780
our guy do it.
Right.

1744
01:03:36,781 --> 01:03:37,451
You know,
that's it and that,

1745
01:03:37,451 --> 01:03:38,284
that's,
that's what I'm saying.

1746
01:03:38,330 --> 01:03:40,040
That's what I'm seeing generally is like
it's a,

1747
01:03:40,280 --> 01:03:42,440
it's our guy doing it so it's okay now.
But um,

1748
01:03:42,470 --> 01:03:43,071
but yeah,
of course.

1749
01:03:43,071 --> 01:03:45,070
I think that that Zuckerberg working 
closely,

1750
01:03:45,080 --> 01:03:45,913
here's the thing,
Zuckerberg wouldn't be working with the 

1751
01:03:47,511 --> 01:03:48,680
government if the government were 
powerful.

1752
01:03:49,310 --> 01:03:50,010
Right?
Like if we,

1753
01:03:50,010 --> 01:03:51,560
we spend a lot of money on the 
government,

1754
01:03:51,561 --> 01:03:52,394
we give money to political candidates.
We spend all of our time talking about 

1755
01:03:55,191 --> 01:03:57,560
trump or hillary because the 
government's powerful.

1756
01:03:57,790 --> 01:04:02,790
I think anybody spent tons of time 
talking like in 1836 about,

1757
01:04:02,991 --> 01:04:03,824
about the national election.
I'm sure they spend some time talking 

1758
01:04:05,181 --> 01:04:06,014
about it,
but it wasn't dominant the way that it 

1759
01:04:06,621 --> 01:04:09,050
is now.
The idea that people were just,

1760
01:04:09,080 --> 01:04:11,160
they could be the most important 
decision that I was.

1761
01:04:11,161 --> 01:04:12,920
People not dating,
right.

1762
01:04:12,921 --> 01:04:13,754
Destroying their lives because if who 
won the presidency when it was Franklin 

1763
01:04:17,210 --> 01:04:18,370
Pierce,
no,

1764
01:04:18,560 --> 01:04:19,700
nobody,
nobody was doing that.

1765
01:04:19,701 --> 01:04:20,534
This is part of the reason is that the 
federal government just was not 

1766
01:04:22,700 --> 01:04:24,740
particularly powerful.
So what do you care what some bureaucrat

1767
01:04:24,741 --> 01:04:26,300
in Washington DC is doing?
It doesn't affect you.

1768
01:04:26,370 --> 01:04:27,450
So that really,
uh,

1769
01:04:27,451 --> 01:04:30,000
I've said this a couple times.
To me that's the best argument for small

1770
01:04:30,001 --> 01:04:30,351
government.
Yeah,

1771
01:04:30,351 --> 01:04:31,184
I agree.
Which is if you don't like Hillary and 

1772
01:04:33,841 --> 01:04:35,640
you don't like trump,
it's not,

1773
01:04:35,670 --> 01:04:38,650
well then I should vote for more 
Democrats or vote for more Republicans.

1774
01:04:39,330 --> 01:04:40,460
These idiots out of our way.

1775
01:04:40,770 --> 01:04:41,700
Exactly.
Exactly.

1776
01:04:41,701 --> 01:04:42,780
And that's,
and that's the,

1777
01:04:42,870 --> 01:04:44,150
I think the only smart thing,
the repair,

1778
01:04:44,160 --> 01:04:44,993
he said in his presidential campaign in 
2012 and you said you wanted to make 

1779
01:04:46,591 --> 01:04:48,540
Washington dc insignificant in your 
life.

1780
01:04:48,810 --> 01:04:49,471
I was like,
yeah,

1781
01:04:49,471 --> 01:04:50,540
that sounds great to me.
Yeah.

1782
01:04:50,620 --> 01:04:52,700
Because I said or anything else.
Yeah,

1783
01:04:52,701 --> 01:04:53,580
exactly.
I said,

1784
01:04:53,581 --> 01:04:54,414
I set it up.
I say this on college campuses all the 

1785
01:04:55,231 --> 01:04:57,690
time on college campuses.
Kids are constantly thinking,

1786
01:04:57,691 --> 01:04:59,330
oh,
there's so many obstacles to what I want

1787
01:04:59,331 --> 01:05:00,390
to do.
And you see in politics now,

1788
01:05:00,391 --> 01:05:02,160
trump keeps saying there's an obstacle 
to what you want to do,

1789
01:05:02,161 --> 01:05:02,994
and I'm the left.
Hillary says there's an obstacle and 

1790
01:05:04,141 --> 01:05:04,974
I'll knock down all obstacles.
We're all gonna knock down all the 

1791
01:05:06,421 --> 01:05:08,070
obstacles and they erect new obstacles,
right?

1792
01:05:08,190 --> 01:05:09,190
Yeah.
And it's in,

1793
01:05:09,390 --> 01:05:11,580
what I've always said is nobody gives a 
crap about you.

1794
01:05:12,080 --> 01:05:12,900
Like no one cares about you.

1795
01:05:12,900 --> 01:05:14,550
No one sitting around going,
Dave Ruben,

1796
01:05:14,551 --> 01:05:16,690
I got to stop that guy.
How do I stop Dave rule?

1797
01:05:16,710 --> 01:05:18,280
But there's a couple of people there.
There are,

1798
01:05:18,281 --> 01:05:19,870
there are a few people.
That's true.

1799
01:05:20,060 --> 01:05:21,340
But as a,
as a general matter,

1800
01:05:21,430 --> 01:05:23,440
if you weren't even in politics,
if you're just a guy,

1801
01:05:23,500 --> 01:05:25,120
right?
Nobody would be sitting around going,

1802
01:05:25,121 --> 01:05:28,020
how do I stop Dave Rubin for becoming a 
successful accountant right now?

1803
01:05:28,021 --> 01:05:28,854
Nobody is doing that.
And except that the government does do 

1804
01:05:31,421 --> 01:05:32,254
that actually.
And so if we could apply that same 

1805
01:05:33,761 --> 01:05:36,180
sentiment to the government like nobody,
it's none.

1806
01:05:36,220 --> 01:05:37,600
It's nobody's business.
What you do with your life,

1807
01:05:37,990 --> 01:05:40,510
leave me alone.
Solve your own problems,

1808
01:05:40,900 --> 01:05:41,733
right?
Those,

1809
01:05:41,740 --> 01:05:43,990
those few sentences in conjunction would
solve a lot of,

1810
01:05:44,120 --> 01:05:45,310
would solve a lot of problems,
right?

1811
01:05:45,311 --> 01:05:47,920
Solve your own problems.
Get the government out of your life.

1812
01:05:47,950 --> 01:05:50,620
Nobody cares about you except like you 
and your family and your friends,

1813
01:05:51,180 --> 01:05:51,330
right?

1814
01:05:51,330 --> 01:05:53,410
Know nobody's actively plotting against 
you.

1815
01:05:53,470 --> 01:05:55,090
I know that we all live in our own 
little movie and we did.

1816
01:05:55,091 --> 01:05:57,550
We all live in our movie where they're a
great villains and you're the great hero

1817
01:05:57,551 --> 01:05:59,560
and we're all like this.
Every human being is like this,

1818
01:05:59,561 --> 01:06:02,110
which is why movies are successful,
but in reality,

1819
01:06:02,710 --> 01:06:06,950
how many people in a lifetime actually 
have active enemies who are acquiring,

1820
01:06:07,000 --> 01:06:07,833
attempting to thwart their every move?
You know how many people just have like 

1821
01:06:09,941 --> 01:06:11,350
the jerk of a boss?
He's bothering them.

1822
01:06:11,980 --> 01:06:15,670
Although oddly in our space now for 
public people,

1823
01:06:15,810 --> 01:06:18,550
the idea of the enemies is growing.
Oh yes.

1824
01:06:18,610 --> 01:06:19,570
Yeah.
I get it.

1825
01:06:19,571 --> 01:06:21,170
For the regular person.
You know,

1826
01:06:21,190 --> 01:06:23,390
it would be nice to think that now you 
say regular,

1827
01:06:23,391 --> 01:06:24,660
we don't mean like less than we just 
people,

1828
01:06:24,661 --> 01:06:25,870
not politics.
Exactly.

1829
01:06:25,930 --> 01:06:27,580
I think people that are probably doing 
much,

1830
01:06:27,581 --> 01:06:30,490
much more for the world,
but we are but,

1831
01:06:30,770 --> 01:06:31,603
but the idea that you stake out a 
position now publicly and you 

1832
01:06:34,901 --> 01:06:36,040
immediately have enemies.

1833
01:06:36,040 --> 01:06:36,873
I mean I see all the time now things 
will be written about me that I know 

1834
01:06:38,951 --> 01:06:39,784
were absolutely not true.
And they'll call me your far right 

1835
01:06:42,131 --> 01:06:42,964
winger and they'll all of these things,
what I've said about this or that and 

1836
01:06:45,371 --> 01:06:46,204
they misquote me or any of this or like 
partial quote and it's like I could 

1837
01:06:49,001 --> 01:06:51,760
spend the rest of my life fighting this 
stuff or I can ignore it.

1838
01:06:51,761 --> 01:06:55,150
And I usually try to ignore it because I
got to live somewhere.

1839
01:06:55,750 --> 01:06:57,550
And again,
it's because of these topics have become

1840
01:06:57,551 --> 01:07:02,410
so intense because there is so much 
control over how these things go.

1841
01:07:02,710 --> 01:07:05,200
And also when one,
when the government's very small,

1842
01:07:05,590 --> 01:07:06,423
everyone on the eye,
everyone on the inside is a little bit 

1843
01:07:07,571 --> 01:07:10,030
fascist.
But I mean by that is everybody wants to

1844
01:07:10,031 --> 01:07:11,080
be the king,
right?

1845
01:07:11,090 --> 01:07:13,210
It's just you don't want anybody else to
be the king.

1846
01:07:13,540 --> 01:07:14,930
You want to be the king,
right?

1847
01:07:15,040 --> 01:07:15,873
You'll be the good king.
You'll be the one person in human 

1848
01:07:16,811 --> 01:07:17,644
history has been an excellent,
excellent king who is always generous 

1849
01:07:20,561 --> 01:07:22,900
with power and decent with everybody.
You're going to be too narrow,

1850
01:07:22,901 --> 01:07:23,521
storm,
boring.

1851
01:07:23,521 --> 01:07:24,354
You're just gonna go around breaking 
chains and everything's going to be 

1852
01:07:25,541 --> 01:07:29,800
spectacular and that,
and so as politics,

1853
01:07:30,100 --> 01:07:30,933
when politics was small,
that didn't matter because the best 

1854
01:07:32,621 --> 01:07:34,400
thing you could hope for to be your own,
you know,

1855
01:07:34,410 --> 01:07:36,010
your,
your fiefdom was your house,

1856
01:07:36,040 --> 01:07:37,000
your fiefdom,
you're homeless,

1857
01:07:37,001 --> 01:07:38,770
your kingdom,
your fiefdom was your family,

1858
01:07:38,771 --> 01:07:39,604
right?
It was.

1859
01:07:39,700 --> 01:07:40,533
Those are the people you were,
those were your subjects and those were 

1860
01:07:41,921 --> 01:07:42,581
your citizens,
right?

1861
01:07:42,581 --> 01:07:44,160
Those were the people.
You took care of a,

1862
01:07:44,200 --> 01:07:47,710
and now government is so big that you 
actually have a shot at being king.

1863
01:07:47,920 --> 01:07:48,753
And when people think they have a shot 
at being king or at least getting into 

1864
01:07:50,440 --> 01:07:53,080
position a person who is going to be the
king for them,

1865
01:07:53,650 --> 01:07:56,200
then you're an obstacle to their utopia,
right?

1866
01:07:56,200 --> 01:07:57,033
It trump,
if trump is utopia and I'm not voting 

1867
01:07:58,301 --> 01:07:59,350
for him,
I'm an obstacle to their,

1868
01:07:59,351 --> 01:08:02,440
you'd hope you have hillary is utopia 
and she's going to be the great,

1869
01:08:02,590 --> 01:08:05,620
the great chain breaker and I'm standing
in her way,

1870
01:08:05,950 --> 01:08:07,960
then I'm an obstacle to utopia,
right?

1871
01:08:07,961 --> 01:08:09,490
Everybody either becomes,
as I've said before,

1872
01:08:09,491 --> 01:08:10,324
a tool or an obstacle to utopia.
If you think that utopia is realizable 

1873
01:08:12,911 --> 01:08:15,920
on a political level,
if you don't think that you're a fool,

1874
01:08:15,921 --> 01:08:17,990
like one of the things that,
one of the things that I've,

1875
01:08:17,991 --> 01:08:20,040
uh,
I think there are certain areas where it

1876
01:08:20,041 --> 01:08:20,874
just in life you become more mature as 
you get older a little bit and you see 

1877
01:08:22,881 --> 01:08:25,010
more of this.
And one is that when you're,

1878
01:08:25,040 --> 01:08:27,420
when you're 18 or 19 or 20,
your utopian,

1879
01:08:27,421 --> 01:08:28,254
you think,
how do I solve this problem and this 

1880
01:08:28,881 --> 01:08:30,110
problem won't be a problem ever again.

1881
01:08:30,380 --> 01:08:32,570
And then you read more history and you 
deal in politics more,

1882
01:08:32,571 --> 01:08:34,520
and you realize there's never a problem 
that actually goes away.

1883
01:08:34,521 --> 01:08:36,770
All the problems come back.
And it's just a question of,

1884
01:08:36,771 --> 01:08:38,360
can you push the ball a little bit this 
way?

1885
01:08:38,420 --> 01:08:39,253
Can you push it a little,
a little bit this way in favor of human 

1886
01:08:40,221 --> 01:08:41,180
liberty.
Can you push?

1887
01:08:41,360 --> 01:08:42,193
Can you,
can you push the looming disaster a 

1888
01:08:43,191 --> 01:08:44,990
little bit further down the road?
Right?

1889
01:08:44,991 --> 01:08:45,781
Is that it?
And,

1890
01:08:45,781 --> 01:08:47,770
and when you do that,
you become,

1891
01:08:47,840 --> 01:08:50,330
you become a problem for people who want
utopia.

1892
01:08:50,331 --> 01:08:54,200
Because Utopia requires a lot of people 
to be willing to sacrifice their present

1893
01:08:54,201 --> 01:08:55,980
for a future that doesn't exist.
Uh,

1894
01:08:56,180 --> 01:08:57,470
and that's,
that's a scary thing.

1895
01:08:57,471 --> 01:08:58,910
I think everybody's a little bit Utopian
now.

1896
01:08:58,911 --> 01:08:59,744
And that's,
that's everyone's feeling that on both 

1897
01:09:01,431 --> 01:09:01,911
sides,
right?

1898
01:09:01,911 --> 01:09:04,190
Because you could argue that the trump 
people are feeling it.

1899
01:09:04,200 --> 01:09:05,720
He's gonna bring all the jobs back to 
Ohio.

1900
01:09:05,721 --> 01:09:06,860
All of them are coming back,
right?

1901
01:09:06,861 --> 01:09:09,320
He's going to make sure that we never 
have a terrorist attack on American soil

1902
01:09:09,321 --> 01:09:10,154
again,
and he's going to do it with his magic 

1903
01:09:10,941 --> 01:09:11,780
wand.
Right?

1904
01:09:11,781 --> 01:09:13,850
And he's going to do it by not trusting 
the CIA or the FBI,

1905
01:09:13,851 --> 01:09:14,684
but still we'll get it done somehow.
We should pause there for a second 

1906
01:09:16,851 --> 01:09:17,684
because what,
what are you making that we were just 

1907
01:09:18,381 --> 01:09:23,381
for one minute.
I have no idea what to do.

1908
01:09:23,961 --> 01:09:24,621
So,
so yes,

1909
01:09:24,621 --> 01:09:26,580
I think Russia hacked the DNC.
Uh,

1910
01:09:26,690 --> 01:09:29,360
do I think that it exposed things that 
were,

1911
01:09:29,361 --> 01:09:30,750
you see the evidence,
right?

1912
01:09:30,790 --> 01:09:33,040
Okay.
So was legit,

1913
01:09:33,080 --> 01:09:33,741
right?
Yeah.

1914
01:09:33,741 --> 01:09:35,600
I mean,
the Democrats are basically acknowledged

1915
01:09:35,601 --> 01:09:37,730
that the contents of it were real.
They weren't making things up.

1916
01:09:37,731 --> 01:09:41,690
So I think Russia was behind the hacks.
And so I think that shaped the election.

1917
01:09:41,720 --> 01:09:43,760
Not really.
I think Hillary would have lost anyway.

1918
01:09:44,090 --> 01:09:44,923
And the,
I did a piece a few minutes ago about 

1919
01:09:46,581 --> 01:09:49,190
this where I think that there's some 
evidence to that effect.

1920
01:09:49,370 --> 01:09:51,140
One is that hillary is unfavorable 
ratings.

1921
01:09:51,170 --> 01:09:52,003
In January of this year,
before any of the wikileaks stuff 

1922
01:09:53,781 --> 01:09:55,940
happened,
her favorable ratings were,

1923
01:09:55,941 --> 01:09:58,670
I think it was 43% favorable.
Uh,

1924
01:09:58,870 --> 01:10:00,050
sorry,
it's 38% favorable,

1925
01:10:00,051 --> 01:10:03,580
56% unfavorable.
November 4th through seventh.

1926
01:10:03,590 --> 01:10:06,560
Right before the election,
she was at 43% favorable,

1927
01:10:06,561 --> 01:10:09,440
56% unfavorable,
so she did not move at all.

1928
01:10:09,470 --> 01:10:10,700
Right.
There was no point where she built,

1929
01:10:10,760 --> 01:10:13,310
she was consistently unpopular all the 
way across.

1930
01:10:13,311 --> 01:10:14,144
It wasn't wiki leaks made are unpopular.
The big thing that hurt her in the last 

1931
01:10:16,730 --> 01:10:19,940
couple of weeks was the comey thing was 
the FBI director saying he was reopening

1932
01:10:19,941 --> 01:10:20,774
the investigation and that had nothing 
to do with Wiki leaks that had to do 

1933
01:10:22,491 --> 01:10:25,520
with Anthony Weiner's computer.
So it wasn't the wikileaks that actually

1934
01:10:25,521 --> 01:10:26,330
shifted things,
right?

1935
01:10:26,330 --> 01:10:26,781
It was.
It was.

1936
01:10:26,781 --> 01:10:27,614
It was a lot of other things,
but it wasn't the wikileaks per se that 

1937
01:10:29,950 --> 01:10:31,130
that said,
again,

1938
01:10:31,131 --> 01:10:32,750
this is a case of shoe on the other 
foot.

1939
01:10:32,960 --> 01:10:37,820
If the Russians had hacked the RNC and 
trump loses by 80,000

1940
01:10:37,821 --> 01:10:39,410
votes in three states,
right.

1941
01:10:39,650 --> 01:10:41,780
Are we crying black or,
or be up in arms.

1942
01:10:41,810 --> 01:10:42,121
Oh,
right,

1943
01:10:42,121 --> 01:10:42,471
right,
right.

1944
01:10:42,471 --> 01:10:43,161
Exactly.
Would we,

1945
01:10:43,161 --> 01:10:44,130
and would we be,
you know,

1946
01:10:44,140 --> 01:10:46,190
we have people on the right would be 
crying bloody murder.

1947
01:10:46,191 --> 01:10:47,930
It'd be the end of the world.
Again,

1948
01:10:48,020 --> 01:10:49,900
the hypocrisy on both sides is pretty 
astonishing.

1949
01:10:49,901 --> 01:10:51,620
I'm the on the left going,
although those evil,

1950
01:10:51,621 --> 01:10:52,460
evil,
evil Russians,

1951
01:10:52,461 --> 01:10:53,810
they're so evil.
I hate the Russians.

1952
01:10:53,960 --> 01:10:57,110
In 2012 Obama was openly saying caught 
on microphone.

1953
01:10:57,230 --> 01:10:59,780
I want flexibility.
I can give flexibility to Russia if they

1954
01:10:59,781 --> 01:11:02,300
helped me out in this election cycle,
no problem.

1955
01:11:02,510 --> 01:11:03,343
That's fine.
Months of when Romney said they're our 

1956
01:11:04,911 --> 01:11:07,010
biggest geopolitical foe and everyone 
mocked him.

1957
01:11:07,010 --> 01:11:08,750
Right.
And and also within months of hint of,

1958
01:11:08,751 --> 01:11:09,584
of Obama backing off the red line in 
Syria and within two years of him 

1959
01:11:12,411 --> 01:11:14,310
backing off of the Ukraine stuff,
right?

1960
01:11:14,460 --> 01:11:16,830
And so they didn't care about Russia for
years ago,

1961
01:11:16,831 --> 01:11:18,930
but now they care deeply about the 
threat of Russian on the right.

1962
01:11:19,170 --> 01:11:20,003
The same people going,
Russia's our major geopolitical foe in 

1963
01:11:21,751 --> 01:11:23,610
20 [inaudible].
I don't see the problem with gluten.

1964
01:11:23,611 --> 01:11:25,120
Well why?
Why can't we be friends with Putin who,

1965
01:11:25,121 --> 01:11:26,160
how's this?
How's this a problem?

1966
01:11:26,161 --> 01:11:27,600
And say,
my goodness.

1967
01:11:27,601 --> 01:11:28,171
I mean if,
if your,

1968
01:11:28,171 --> 01:11:29,004
if your belief switch that fast,
I'm going to go with you really had not 

1969
01:11:30,901 --> 01:11:31,734
a lot of core.
So to me because I can't really figure 

1970
01:11:34,861 --> 01:11:37,790
out what the actual truth is.
I don't think anyone really knows that.

1971
01:11:37,791 --> 01:11:38,624
We haven't seen the right out of the 
question is do you believe the CIA and 

1972
01:11:40,681 --> 01:11:43,620
the FBI or do you believe self motivated
people on both sides?

1973
01:11:43,920 --> 01:11:44,753
Although right now it sounds like the 
CIA and FBI aren't even in complete 

1974
01:11:46,681 --> 01:11:50,500
agreement on what happened.
They both do agree that the,

1975
01:11:50,501 --> 01:11:53,160
that the Russian sources were behind the
attacks,

1976
01:11:53,190 --> 01:11:54,540
they just don't agree on what the motive
was.

1977
01:11:54,650 --> 01:11:55,081
Right,
right.

1978
01:11:55,081 --> 01:11:58,620
So the FBI says it was to undermine the 
election integrity and the CIA says that

1979
01:11:58,621 --> 01:12:00,480
it was to get trump elected.
Yeah.

1980
01:12:00,510 --> 01:12:02,430
Given trump's position stated positions 
on Putin,

1981
01:12:02,431 --> 01:12:04,200
which were incredibly warm throughout 
the campaign,

1982
01:12:04,201 --> 01:12:06,240
I don't find the CIA's claim 
implausible,

1983
01:12:06,241 --> 01:12:07,860
but again,
their motives doesn't,

1984
01:12:07,861 --> 01:12:08,694
don't matter.
Bottom line is did they shift the 

1985
01:12:09,871 --> 01:12:11,820
election?
There is no evidence they did.

1986
01:12:11,940 --> 01:12:14,820
So the reason I guess I'm a little more 
skeptical is that if,

1987
01:12:14,821 --> 01:12:16,970
let's say we really knew it was true at 
some,

1988
01:12:17,340 --> 01:12:21,630
that this was true technic,
wouldn't that basically be an act of war

1989
01:12:21,631 --> 01:12:22,301
at this point?
If,

1990
01:12:22,301 --> 01:12:23,134
if Obama knew right now,
if the FBI or CIA came to him that this 

1991
01:12:26,341 --> 01:12:27,174
actually happened,
they were in cahoots with trump or 

1992
01:12:29,371 --> 01:12:31,560
whatever it is,
you would be an act.

1993
01:12:31,590 --> 01:12:35,520
I mean either way down sanctions or some
sort of military,

1994
01:12:35,521 --> 01:12:36,354
I mean that would,
that would be a true undermining of our 

1995
01:12:37,621 --> 01:12:41,460
democracy at the highest levels.
So the fact that we're not talking about

1996
01:12:41,461 --> 01:12:42,930
that,
not that I want to be a war with Russia,

1997
01:12:42,931 --> 01:12:44,310
I would be completely again against.
Right.

1998
01:12:44,750 --> 01:12:48,120
But the fact that it's not getting to 
that level shows me that this seems like

1999
01:12:48,121 --> 01:12:52,450
more of a game or political showmanship 
then something that's real.

2000
01:12:52,910 --> 01:12:55,020
It also demonstrates a massive increase 
in partisanship.

2001
01:12:55,110 --> 01:12:55,943
And the reason I say that is because go 
back to 1972 and Richard Nixon is 

2002
01:12:58,981 --> 01:12:59,814
bugging the Watergate Hotel and an 
attempt to get information about 

2003
01:13:02,161 --> 01:13:02,970
mcgovern.
Right.

2004
01:13:02,970 --> 01:13:05,250
And he's swamps mcgovern.
It's pretty clear that he didn't need to

2005
01:13:05,251 --> 01:13:07,290
bug the hotel in order to get the 
information.

2006
01:13:07,291 --> 01:13:09,570
Matt mcgovern to swamp them make up the 
winds like two states.

2007
01:13:09,840 --> 01:13:10,673
So,
and then he's impeached by row 

2008
01:13:12,950 --> 01:13:13,670
Republicans.

2009
01:13:13,670 --> 01:13:15,720
Republicans are getting,
and he's not technically he retires,

2010
01:13:15,721 --> 01:13:17,430
but he's about to be impeached by 
Republicans.

2011
01:13:17,870 --> 01:13:19,440
Or Republicans are going to impeach him 
for that.

2012
01:13:19,680 --> 01:13:22,800
Now you have a foreign power doing what 
Nixon did write the exact same thing and

2013
01:13:22,801 --> 01:13:23,850
they bugged the DNC,
right?

2014
01:13:23,851 --> 01:13:24,511
They,
that's the,

2015
01:13:24,511 --> 01:13:25,344
that the allegation and nobody on the 
right cares and nobody on the right 

2016
01:13:29,001 --> 01:13:29,341
care.
It's like,

2017
01:13:29,341 --> 01:13:30,840
it's,
I don't think that has to do with,

2018
01:13:31,200 --> 01:13:32,700
you know,
people aren't taking this seriously.

2019
01:13:32,701 --> 01:13:35,310
I think that one of the questions is 
just,

2020
01:13:35,920 --> 01:13:36,753
all right,
how happy are you that they did it and 

2021
01:13:38,011 --> 01:13:38,844
when the question is and,
and so I think that there are a lot of 

2022
01:13:40,531 --> 01:13:41,700
people on the right guy.
Well,

2023
01:13:41,701 --> 01:13:43,020
it's good they did it.
I don't mind that they did it.

2024
01:13:43,021 --> 01:13:44,550
I mean,
after all hillary had it coming,

2025
01:13:44,790 --> 01:13:45,623
that's like that.
So didn't mcgovern kind of in the sense 

2026
01:13:47,431 --> 01:13:48,264
that the government was awful,
but that doesn't really change the 

2027
01:13:50,011 --> 01:13:50,844
activity.

2028
01:13:50,970 --> 01:13:51,803
Well,
isn't the other piece of this that if 

2029
01:13:52,981 --> 01:13:53,814
this all happened,
doesn't it show ineptitude at the 

2030
01:13:56,341 --> 01:13:58,770
highest levels of our current 
government?

2031
01:13:58,771 --> 01:13:59,604
I mean this,
not that Obama in self would be making 

2032
01:14:01,711 --> 01:14:02,544
decisions related to this,
but you'd have to fire almost everyone 

2033
01:14:05,310 --> 01:14:08,250
at every security service.
And then at the DNC,

2034
01:14:08,251 --> 01:14:09,930
right,
everybody was responsible for the,

2035
01:14:09,960 --> 01:14:11,640
for the security of the DNC.
Yeah.

2036
01:14:11,740 --> 01:14:13,680
But it has been government agencies 
apparently there,

2037
01:14:13,700 --> 01:14:14,533
there's some hacking of government 
agencies has been going on for a while 

2038
01:14:15,951 --> 01:14:16,784
and the word cyber war with,
with China and we have been for a long 

2039
01:14:18,221 --> 01:14:19,330
time.
Um,

2040
01:14:19,570 --> 01:14:20,860
yes.
I mean the government,

2041
01:14:21,070 --> 01:14:21,903
as I've said,
socks at virtually everything and the 

2042
01:14:24,161 --> 01:14:26,260
solution seems to be more government 
from both sides.

2043
01:14:26,261 --> 01:14:28,970
Now the year of small government is over
and the,

2044
01:14:28,980 --> 01:14:30,430
the,
the idea that the government is going to

2045
01:14:30,490 --> 01:14:33,010
shrink in any margin in any measurable 
way,

2046
01:14:33,011 --> 01:14:34,450
I think is,
is fallacy.

2047
01:14:34,900 --> 01:14:37,350
So on the history repeats itself for a 
long game idea.

2048
01:14:37,380 --> 01:14:38,580
There is opportunity here,
right?

2049
01:14:38,581 --> 01:14:39,414
Because let it get big so that people 
will ultimately see that it does not 

2050
01:14:42,690 --> 01:14:43,710
work.
And then,

2051
01:14:44,010 --> 01:14:47,390
and then the era of small government may
be can come or do you think is right and

2052
01:14:47,400 --> 01:14:49,230
get to a tipping point where you just 
can't come back.

2053
01:14:49,270 --> 01:14:49,751
Yeah,
I mean I,

2054
01:14:49,751 --> 01:14:51,040
I do think that you get to a tipping 
point,

2055
01:14:51,360 --> 01:14:52,810
but it sounded tipping point where you 
can't come back.

2056
01:14:52,811 --> 01:14:54,570
It's a tipping point where we actually 
hit disaster right here,

2057
01:14:54,590 --> 01:14:57,460
the Greek tipping point where at a 
certain point you must hit the austerity

2058
01:14:57,461 --> 01:14:58,294
button because otherwise your country is
absolutely bankrupt and then you get 

2059
01:15:00,581 --> 01:15:02,470
riots in the streets.
And so the question is how,

2060
01:15:02,560 --> 01:15:04,300
how ugly are things when reality sets 
in?

2061
01:15:04,301 --> 01:15:07,870
Because the reality is you can't keep 
affording to pay for all of this stuff.

2062
01:15:08,260 --> 01:15:09,093
Eventually one of two things happens 
either wise up or you go bankrupt like 

2063
01:15:11,360 --> 01:15:13,510
California's about to do when things get
really ugly.

2064
01:15:13,750 --> 01:15:14,583
So it's,
so the question is which one we head 

2065
01:15:16,181 --> 01:15:20,530
toward and the fact that a lot of the 
gains of sort of the Buckley,

2066
01:15:20,560 --> 01:15:21,393
Reagan conservative small government era
had been put behind us in favor of this 

2067
01:15:25,691 --> 01:15:27,760
bigger government nationalist populism.

2068
01:15:28,120 --> 01:15:30,820
That's not a good sign that we're moving
in in the wising up direction.

2069
01:15:30,821 --> 01:15:33,640
It's actually a sign that we're moving 
in the opposite and that word that we're

2070
01:15:33,970 --> 01:15:35,230
kind of now,
okay,

2071
01:15:35,231 --> 01:15:35,981
fine.
The government's peg,

2072
01:15:35,981 --> 01:15:38,890
we except the government's big.
What can the government do for me today?

2073
01:15:39,000 --> 01:15:39,870
Yeah.
Um,

2074
01:15:39,970 --> 01:15:41,170
and that's,
that's a,

2075
01:15:41,171 --> 01:15:42,004
that's a problem.
This is why like people were very 

2076
01:15:43,571 --> 01:15:45,690
intense during the campaign.
Conservatives saying,

2077
01:15:45,691 --> 01:15:47,290
Mike Pence,
trump selects him.

2078
01:15:47,350 --> 01:15:48,183
Isn't that great?
They're very enthusiastic about the 

2079
01:15:49,271 --> 01:15:49,980
pens.
Peck.

2080
01:15:49,980 --> 01:15:50,711
And I was like,
yeah,

2081
01:15:50,711 --> 01:15:51,544
Mike Pence seems good.
And then you've got my pencil now going 

2082
01:15:53,531 --> 01:15:54,364
around to rallies with Donald Trump is 
free markets here saying that he's okay 

2083
01:15:57,941 --> 01:15:58,774
with tariffs and saying the free market 
fails when it's tried and from going 

2084
01:16:02,291 --> 01:16:03,670
every time,
every time.

2085
01:16:03,671 --> 01:16:04,870
And it's like,
Whoa,

2086
01:16:04,871 --> 01:16:05,161
whoa,
Whoa,

2087
01:16:05,161 --> 01:16:05,741
whoa.
Hold on.

2088
01:16:05,741 --> 01:16:07,810
That's very sick coming from trump.
Okay.

2089
01:16:07,811 --> 01:16:09,430
That trump's been saying that stick the 
whole time.

2090
01:16:09,760 --> 01:16:13,320
But like pence rally good.
At what point until we,

2091
01:16:13,630 --> 01:16:15,190
as I say,
we're not going to see,

2092
01:16:15,370 --> 01:16:16,203
you know,
really where the Republican party lies 

2093
01:16:17,950 --> 01:16:20,310
until the first conflict between trump 
and the republicans.

2094
01:16:20,560 --> 01:16:21,393
Like,
are there enough republicans who are 

2095
01:16:22,060 --> 01:16:24,700
going to stand up against him?
I don't think so either.

2096
01:16:24,701 --> 01:16:25,534
And I think the trump has building 
machine outside government in order to 

2097
01:16:27,071 --> 01:16:28,720
take down the ones who do.
Right.

2098
01:16:28,721 --> 01:16:29,201
He's,
he,

2099
01:16:29,201 --> 01:16:31,150
he has Kellyanne Conway building this 
uh,

2100
01:16:31,151 --> 01:16:31,984
this apparently this machine,
it's going to seek to push his message 

2101
01:16:34,841 --> 01:16:37,120
outside government and maybe primary 
people who,

2102
01:16:37,121 --> 01:16:39,280
who don't grant him the leeway.
So

2103
01:16:40,460 --> 01:16:41,293
such a sad state of affairs because it's
like we've never needed a strong 

2104
01:16:43,251 --> 01:16:45,890
independent fourth the state more than 
this.

2105
01:16:45,900 --> 01:16:46,733
That's right here.
That functions properly now and it's 

2106
01:16:48,531 --> 01:16:50,410
exactly what we don't have.

2107
01:16:50,570 --> 01:16:51,440
Yeah.
Well this is a,

2108
01:16:51,441 --> 01:16:52,274
I've been saying this now for several 
months and I was thinking during the 

2109
01:16:54,801 --> 01:16:57,470
Obama era too,
is that it was clear that the country is

2110
01:16:57,471 --> 01:17:01,370
ready for a demagogic fashion efficient 
stick leader.

2111
01:17:01,400 --> 01:17:02,660
Cause they just want something done.
Right.

2112
01:17:02,661 --> 01:17:04,010
That's the fascist.
Like people,

2113
01:17:04,070 --> 01:17:08,120
the Word Fascism always brings to mind 
Nazis and Jack boots and all this stuff.

2114
01:17:08,121 --> 01:17:12,650
But the truth is that most kind of,
most dictatorial governments don't start

2115
01:17:12,651 --> 01:17:14,060
off that way.
Most of them start off with,

2116
01:17:14,061 --> 01:17:15,470
we have a breakdown in the political 
system.

2117
01:17:15,471 --> 01:17:17,000
We need somebody to do something right 
now.

2118
01:17:17,001 --> 01:17:18,980
Right now there are too many pressing 
problems.

2119
01:17:19,190 --> 01:17:20,840
Get somebody in there to fix it right 
now.

2120
01:17:21,230 --> 01:17:24,950
And if you look back at history,
most dictatorial governments don't start

2121
01:17:24,951 --> 01:17:25,784
with the ultimately bad dictator.
They start with a couple of educators 

2122
01:17:27,651 --> 01:17:29,360
who actually are not quite as bad,
right?

2123
01:17:29,360 --> 01:17:30,730
If you look at it like Germany,
1930,

2124
01:17:30,750 --> 01:17:34,310
1932 you're looking at at people who 
actually aren't that bad,

2125
01:17:34,311 --> 01:17:35,144
right?
You're looking at it bruning and you're 

2126
01:17:35,571 --> 01:17:38,030
looking at it on paper and you're 
looking at a bunch of people who,

2127
01:17:38,200 --> 01:17:39,033
uh,
who are I hurt people who are like 

2128
01:17:41,300 --> 01:17:45,170
basically not terrible,
awful human beings,

2129
01:17:45,650 --> 01:17:46,483
but the centralize all the power here 
and then the next person who sweeps in 

2130
01:17:48,831 --> 01:17:49,700
is the bad guy,
right?

2131
01:17:49,701 --> 01:17:51,500
So whether you think that Obama was a 
bad guy,

2132
01:17:51,501 --> 01:17:52,334
whether you think trump is the bad guy,
once you bring all the power to one 

2133
01:17:54,321 --> 01:17:55,590
place,
once you've created the,

2134
01:17:55,600 --> 01:17:56,433
once you forged the ring of power,
then it's only a matter of time before 

2135
01:17:59,001 --> 01:18:00,680
the bad guy gets ahold of the ring of 
power.

2136
01:18:00,681 --> 01:18:01,514
Unless you destroy the ring of power.
Because you'll have a bunch of people 

2137
01:18:03,770 --> 01:18:05,120
who are seduced by the ring of power.

2138
01:18:05,570 --> 01:18:06,403
But eventually somebody bad we'll get 
ahold of eventually he'll bring a power 

2139
01:18:08,661 --> 01:18:09,494
will make its way back to sal Ron.
So you may think that trump isn't the 

2140
01:18:11,001 --> 01:18:12,590
guy who's the threat,
which is fine.

2141
01:18:12,591 --> 01:18:13,640
Maybe he isn't.
You know,

2142
01:18:13,641 --> 01:18:17,150
I assume that he isn't because I don't 
really see that we necessarily is.

2143
01:18:17,510 --> 01:18:18,343
Maybe you think Obama wasn't the guy.
Maybe you think that Obama wasn't the 

2144
01:18:20,181 --> 01:18:22,280
true threat to American democracy and 
liberalism,

2145
01:18:22,700 --> 01:18:25,670
but once you've got this much power in 
one place,

2146
01:18:26,600 --> 01:18:27,433
somebody will be,
somebody will be elected at some point 

2147
01:18:28,731 --> 01:18:30,710
who just says,
screw all of the norms.

2148
01:18:31,100 --> 01:18:33,020
Things have to get done.
The trains have to run on time.

2149
01:18:33,050 --> 01:18:33,883
Right?
It's not only

2150
01:18:33,920 --> 01:18:35,480
that,
it may not be the guy you like,

2151
01:18:35,481 --> 01:18:36,830
it could be someone heard,
it could be somebody.

2152
01:18:36,831 --> 01:18:38,870
Really.
That metaphor was pretty good,

2153
01:18:38,871 --> 01:18:40,610
but can you get that into a star wars 
thing?

2154
01:18:40,670 --> 01:18:42,270
Is that possible?
Can you get that into some?

2155
01:18:42,500 --> 01:18:43,333
Well,
I mean,

2156
01:18:43,770 --> 01:18:46,100
there were no real good way to destroy 
the dark side of the force,

2157
01:18:46,101 --> 01:18:46,960
right?
Yeah.

2158
01:18:47,620 --> 01:18:48,930
So in,
in it's,

2159
01:18:48,940 --> 01:18:50,300
it's not quite as,
it's not quite as good,

2160
01:18:50,301 --> 01:18:52,490
but everybody is,
everybody has to do so well.

2161
01:18:52,500 --> 01:18:54,290
Like when you're a kid,
everybody wants to be darth Vader,

2162
01:18:54,291 --> 01:18:54,740
right?
Yeah.

2163
01:18:54,740 --> 01:18:56,300
When you're a kid,
nobody wants to be Luke skywalker.

2164
01:18:56,301 --> 01:18:57,500
Everybody wants to be darth Vader,
darth vader.

2165
01:18:57,501 --> 01:18:59,030
As much cooler,
you can strangle people,

2166
01:18:59,240 --> 01:19:00,140
but his mind,
right?

2167
01:19:00,141 --> 01:19:01,670
I mean,
like he can relate to it.

2168
01:19:01,671 --> 01:19:03,710
It's much cooler.
There's only one problem,

2169
01:19:03,711 --> 01:19:04,544
which is that you also have to build 
this enormous staffs starting below 

2170
01:19:05,671 --> 01:19:08,570
planets.
So eventually the powers,

2171
01:19:09,620 --> 01:19:10,101
right.
I'm in.

2172
01:19:10,101 --> 01:19:11,990
Come on.
Alderaan screw those guys.

2173
01:19:12,020 --> 01:19:13,370
Lauren.
Screw those guys.

2174
01:19:13,820 --> 01:19:14,700
All right,
one more for you.

2175
01:19:14,730 --> 01:19:15,563
Shapiro.

2176
01:19:15,660 --> 01:19:17,620
Uh,
because I get this tweeted at me a lot.

2177
01:19:17,621 --> 01:19:19,360
People say,
Dave,

2178
01:19:19,890 --> 01:19:23,740
you should run for president in 2020,
but on the second part of the ticket,

2179
01:19:23,741 --> 01:19:24,574
Shapiro

2180
01:19:25,050 --> 01:19:25,883
number wine,
you'd show people that bridges can be 

2181
01:19:27,261 --> 01:19:27,831
built,
blah,

2182
01:19:27,831 --> 01:19:28,664
blah,
blah.

2183
01:19:28,850 --> 01:19:32,150
Would you ever go into politics?
I'm not in California.

2184
01:19:32,270 --> 01:19:32,931
Uh,
and,

2185
01:19:32,931 --> 01:19:34,940
and given the way that our current 
politics is going,

2186
01:19:34,941 --> 01:19:36,740
it seems like only celebrities can be 
elected.

2187
01:19:36,741 --> 01:19:38,000
So,
um,

2188
01:19:38,300 --> 01:19:39,500
well you'll have that part down.
I mean,

2189
01:19:39,501 --> 01:19:40,760
you have your following.
That's,

2190
01:19:41,050 --> 01:19:41,720
yeah,
but it's,

2191
01:19:41,720 --> 01:19:42,553
you don't have to be,
it would have to be a lot larger 

2192
01:19:43,221 --> 01:19:45,290
following than that.
Right on that necessarily.

2193
01:19:45,550 --> 01:19:46,383
It's,
uh,

2194
01:19:47,160 --> 01:19:49,670
it's something that,
that I could see doing at some point.

2195
01:19:49,910 --> 01:19:50,780
Um,
yeah,

2196
01:19:50,781 --> 01:19:52,790
2020 is a little soon.
Uh,

2197
01:19:52,800 --> 01:19:54,240
it's a,
it's a,

2198
01:19:54,350 --> 01:19:55,850
but yeah,
I'm,

2199
01:19:55,870 --> 01:19:58,940
I'm not averse to the idea of,
of running for office at some point,

2200
01:19:58,941 --> 01:20:02,240
but it depends on whether you can do 
more good outside of government.

2201
01:20:02,241 --> 01:20:03,074
You're inside government,
especially when you want to destroy the 

2202
01:20:04,101 --> 01:20:05,380
instrument itself.
Uh,

2203
01:20:05,540 --> 01:20:06,373
so is it not just read the entirety of 
the government to destroy a lot of the 

2204
01:20:09,031 --> 01:20:10,010
power of it?
Uh,

2205
01:20:10,240 --> 01:20:11,073
and

2206
01:20:11,310 --> 01:20:13,950
so it sorta could never in a way you'd 
suffer from.

2207
01:20:13,951 --> 01:20:14,784
Although I know you don't.
I'm telling the truth with a little bit 

2208
01:20:15,961 --> 01:20:18,290
with Rand Paul and a lot of stuff.
Um,

2209
01:20:18,330 --> 01:20:19,163
you'd suffer,
you'd suffer [inaudible] policy by the 

2210
01:20:20,521 --> 01:20:21,780
way.
I agree with a lot of what Ram I'll ask.

2211
01:20:21,830 --> 01:20:22,270
Right.
But,

2212
01:20:22,270 --> 01:20:23,940
but I know in foreign policy and some 
other things,

2213
01:20:24,120 --> 01:20:26,250
but you would suffer from the same thing
that he suffered from,

2214
01:20:26,251 --> 01:20:29,160
which is I'm the out,
I'm trying to make this thing smaller.

2215
01:20:29,161 --> 01:20:29,994
You're even if you're all conservatives,
you're still trying to make it bigger 

2216
01:20:32,460 --> 01:20:34,920
for the party.
Can't really rally around you cause it,

2217
01:20:34,921 --> 01:20:36,900
it doesn't really fit the way people 
think.

2218
01:20:36,930 --> 01:20:38,080
Yeah.
I mean I think that

2219
01:20:38,940 --> 01:20:42,760
to benefit from backlash politics,
you have to have,

2220
01:20:43,060 --> 01:20:43,893
as you say,
there could come a point where 

2221
01:20:44,381 --> 01:20:45,214
government is so big that people are 
actually willing to hear a message of 

2222
01:20:47,021 --> 01:20:48,610
solve your own problems.
Screw the government.

2223
01:20:48,611 --> 01:20:49,444
These people have,
have destroyed lives and power 

2224
01:20:51,941 --> 01:20:53,620
centralizing in one place is not the 
answer.

2225
01:20:54,010 --> 01:20:55,890
Um,
but you know,

2226
01:20:55,930 --> 01:20:56,763
people will have to be convinced of that
because until then everybody has the 

2227
01:21:00,370 --> 01:21:02,920
everybody on the inside,
once that ring,

2228
01:21:03,070 --> 01:21:04,490
everybody inside,
once the,

2229
01:21:04,500 --> 01:21:06,010
the dark side of the force.
And so,

2230
01:21:06,290 --> 01:21:08,740
uh,
my job right now is the same as yours,

2231
01:21:08,741 --> 01:21:12,550
which is tell people the Truth and hope 
that they awakened to the fact that your

2232
01:21:12,551 --> 01:21:14,280
life is in your hands.
Um,

2233
01:21:14,410 --> 01:21:16,240
and if it's not in your hands,
then we need to,

2234
01:21:16,270 --> 01:21:17,103
we need to change the system so that it 
is in your hands and people aren't 

2235
01:21:18,881 --> 01:21:19,714
taking things away from you or promising
you things because the promise is just 

2236
01:21:21,701 --> 01:21:23,500
another way to take something away from 
you.

2237
01:21:23,501 --> 01:21:24,790
Sometimes it's your,
your actual,

2238
01:21:25,000 --> 01:21:25,620
uh,
your,

2239
01:21:25,620 --> 01:21:28,450
your actual self control and self 
esteem.

2240
01:21:28,720 --> 01:21:29,553
Uh,
somebody makes a promise to give you 

2241
01:21:31,031 --> 01:21:32,770
something and they're taking something 
away from you too.

2242
01:21:32,800 --> 01:21:33,940
Nothing is,
nothing is free.

2243
01:21:34,270 --> 01:21:35,740
So if you want to be totally self 
sufficient,

2244
01:21:35,741 --> 01:21:38,770
then we need an actual place that that 
allows self sufficiency.

2245
01:21:39,320 --> 01:21:40,850
Nothing's free.
I thought if you,

2246
01:21:40,940 --> 01:21:42,530
if someone gives you something,
it's free.

2247
01:21:42,650 --> 01:21:44,120
You mean that someone else is paying for
that?

2248
01:21:44,170 --> 01:21:44,991
It's right.
It turns out,

2249
01:21:44,991 --> 01:21:46,460
yeah,
I see.

2250
01:21:46,461 --> 01:21:47,294
I have to do it.
It's that inability to understand that 

2251
01:21:48,681 --> 01:21:49,910
may be screwing all of us.
Yeah.

2252
01:21:50,870 --> 01:21:52,160
Guilty liberal.
Exactly.

2253
01:21:52,161 --> 01:21:53,000
Exactly.
All right,

2254
01:21:53,001 --> 01:21:54,220
well it was a pleasure talking to you.
It was great.

2255
01:21:54,620 --> 01:21:55,940
Great to be here.
And our,

2256
01:21:55,941 --> 01:21:56,774
uh,
your office is not that far from my new 

2257
01:21:58,941 --> 01:21:59,381
student.
Yeah,

2258
01:21:59,381 --> 01:22:00,214
that's true.
So I suspect we'll be doing a lot more 

2259
01:22:01,551 --> 01:22:03,110
of these crossovers.
I think we could,

2260
01:22:03,170 --> 01:22:04,850
you know,
2020.

2261
01:22:04,851 --> 01:22:06,410
I just,
I really,

2262
01:22:06,411 --> 01:22:08,720
I just could never be president.
I could be vice president.

2263
01:22:08,860 --> 01:22:09,160
Well,
it's a,

2264
01:22:09,160 --> 01:22:10,340
it's a cush job.
I mean like,

2265
01:22:10,341 --> 01:22:10,790
yeah,

2266
01:22:10,790 --> 01:22:13,100
he just sit there and you go to like a 
nice house and

2267
01:22:13,350 --> 01:22:15,130
I've yet to meet Joe Biden.
Yeah,

2268
01:22:15,140 --> 01:22:16,390
I'd be very good at that.
I just,

2269
01:22:16,450 --> 01:22:21,010
I feel like you'd be much better in 
terms of the big anyway,

2270
01:22:21,340 --> 01:22:23,080
uh,
for more on Ben Shapiro,

2271
01:22:23,081 --> 01:22:23,914
follow him on twitter at Ben Shapiro.
I tried not to send him Nazi memes if 

2272
01:22:27,911 --> 01:22:28,744
you could.
Uh,

2273
01:22:28,750 --> 01:22:29,620
but again,
if you do,

2274
01:22:29,640 --> 01:22:31,210
if you do all frame them,
put him on my wall,

2275
01:22:31,211 --> 01:22:32,044
you know,
really just take pleasure in them and 

2276
01:22:32,831 --> 01:22:33,664
enjoy them.
Yeah.

2277
01:22:33,670 --> 01:22:35,080
And I know he won't ban you,
so there you go.

2278
01:22:35,081 --> 01:22:35,914
That's true.
All right.
