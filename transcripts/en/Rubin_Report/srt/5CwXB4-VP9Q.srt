00:00:05,090 --> 00:00:07,550
Joining me today is an author,
a screenwriter,

2
00:00:07,551 --> 00:00:08,384
the host of the Andrew Klavan show,
and one of the few same people on the 

3
00:00:12,081 --> 00:00:14,090
Internet.
Andrew Klavan.

4
00:00:14,091 --> 00:00:15,650
Welcome back to the Rubin report.
Thank you.

5
00:00:15,651 --> 00:00:17,330
It's nice to be here.
I love your new studio.

6
00:00:17,420 --> 00:00:18,171
Thanks.
Well,

7
00:00:18,171 --> 00:00:22,310
you are one of the last guests before we
built this home studio,

8
00:00:22,520 --> 00:00:23,353
and we had you on at a very odd time 
because it was right before the 

9
00:00:25,491 --> 00:00:26,324
election,
but we were going to air it after the 

10
00:00:27,891 --> 00:00:30,230
election because I had to pad some shows
because we were,

11
00:00:30,410 --> 00:00:32,960
we were building this.
So I,

12
00:00:33,050 --> 00:00:33,883
and perhaps you too,
when on the assumption that Hillary was 

13
00:00:35,871 --> 00:00:36,704
gonna win and a,
and then people immediately after we 

14
00:00:39,401 --> 00:00:41,120
heard it said,
you got to get Cleveland back on because

15
00:00:41,121 --> 00:00:43,580
you guys got to,
got to clean this whole thing up.

16
00:00:44,540 --> 00:00:45,620
So you're ready to do some cleaning?

17
00:00:45,620 --> 00:00:46,580
I'm ready.
I'm here.

18
00:00:46,660 --> 00:00:47,493
All right.
So where I want to start first is I do 

19
00:00:48,531 --> 00:00:51,230
consider you one of the few sane people 
that I,

20
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:54,590
that speaks ill of view,
but I consistently,

21
00:00:54,591 --> 00:00:58,370
every time I watch one of your clips or 
I see what you're tweeting about,

22
00:00:59,060 --> 00:01:03,170
you strike me as just,
you basically striked me as decent,

23
00:01:03,410 --> 00:01:06,560
which these days I think has a 
correlation between decency,

24
00:01:06,570 --> 00:01:08,300
insanity.
Uh,

25
00:01:08,570 --> 00:01:10,260
that's a lot of pressure I'm giving,
you know,

26
00:01:10,270 --> 00:01:11,103
is right.
It is sad that being decent actually 

27
00:01:12,561 --> 00:01:15,640
elevates you heard these days.
But if,

28
00:01:15,641 --> 00:01:16,580
but you know,
it,

29
00:01:16,581 --> 00:01:21,170
it's the thing with me is that I have,
I can say I can state with my principals

30
00:01:21,171 --> 00:01:22,004
are I can I fall,
I tried to follow my principals and I 

31
00:01:23,841 --> 00:01:26,210
try not to get too mixed up with 
personalities,

32
00:01:26,450 --> 00:01:29,150
which in this day and age with a 
president like trump,

33
00:01:29,151 --> 00:01:33,290
with like the people around you know,
around him makes things a lot clearer.

34
00:01:33,340 --> 00:01:34,173
You know,
because that's what people are paying 

35
00:01:35,391 --> 00:01:36,224
attention to.
They're paying attention to the big 

36
00:01:36,831 --> 00:01:38,390
faces,
the paying attention to that.

37
00:01:38,391 --> 00:01:39,224
He said this and she said that,
and I'm just like trying to follow that 

38
00:01:41,301 --> 00:01:42,134
principle.
Would I know what it is and I'm trying 

39
00:01:43,221 --> 00:01:44,220
to follow that thing.
Yeah.

40
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:47,340
So I think I come from a similar place 
and I think you know,

41
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:49,250
our politics,
which do line up in a lot of ways,

42
00:01:49,251 --> 00:01:50,330
not,
not fully,

43
00:01:50,630 --> 00:01:51,463
but that that's what I try to go for.
Where do you think that comes from 

44
00:01:54,921 --> 00:01:58,510
within you that you don't go for all of 
that other stuff that,

45
00:01:58,550 --> 00:01:59,383
that so many people do well in me is 
actually a matter of time or observing 

46
00:02:02,691 --> 00:02:05,600
over time what works,
what doesn't work.

47
00:02:05,601 --> 00:02:06,890
And also,
you know,

48
00:02:07,970 --> 00:02:10,940
it's just been a basic,
maybe it was the time I was raised in,

49
00:02:10,941 --> 00:02:14,510
but it has been a basic principle of me,
that peace of mind that people should be

50
00:02:14,511 --> 00:02:15,230
free.

51
00:02:15,230 --> 00:02:17,930
That you should be fruit,
that you are,

52
00:02:18,020 --> 00:02:21,050
you know,
made by God to be a free person.

53
00:02:21,051 --> 00:02:24,170
That the things that are happening 
inside you that are expressed in your,

54
00:02:24,290 --> 00:02:25,123
and the things that you like and the 
things that you want to say and your 

55
00:02:27,321 --> 00:02:28,154
opinions on that,
all of those things are a uniquely 

56
00:02:31,161 --> 00:02:33,470
valuable.
And even if you're a jackass,

57
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:35,690
even if you're saying stuff that makes 
me want to strangle you,

58
00:02:35,691 --> 00:02:36,524
you know,
if you're a racist or something like 

59
00:02:37,311 --> 00:02:38,144
this,
I think that there's something uniquely 

60
00:02:39,381 --> 00:02:43,520
valuable bull about that.
And I know that it's more important than

61
00:02:43,521 --> 00:02:46,100
some guy in Washington who knows better 
than you.

62
00:02:46,101 --> 00:02:49,130
And I think that that's,
that's always been my assumption.

63
00:02:49,131 --> 00:02:51,800
It was,
I was raised in that all American way.

64
00:02:51,801 --> 00:02:54,450
I was raised in the suburbs and the 
early sixties you know,

65
00:02:54,451 --> 00:02:56,510
it's just,
that was kind of what that was the civic

66
00:02:56,511 --> 00:03:00,160
religion and it always good to me and 
the,

67
00:03:00,161 --> 00:03:04,840
when things changed I would listen to 
the arguments and I fall,

68
00:03:04,841 --> 00:03:05,674
I've changed you.

69
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:09,400
I've developed and that things get are 
different over time,

70
00:03:09,610 --> 00:03:13,600
but certain principles stay the same and
if you stick with that you basically,

71
00:03:13,601 --> 00:03:14,351
I don't know,
you know,

72
00:03:14,351 --> 00:03:15,184
it's,
it's a question of actually enjoying 

73
00:03:16,151 --> 00:03:18,700
other people and even when they can be 
jerks.

74
00:03:18,701 --> 00:03:20,920
Sometimes I like them,
you know,

75
00:03:20,921 --> 00:03:21,754
I'd like you can enjoy sitting across 
from someone that you don't agree with 

76
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:27,490
you saying that,
that you can do that.

77
00:03:27,491 --> 00:03:28,810
This is the thing.
When you don't,

78
00:03:28,811 --> 00:03:29,644
whenever I see on Youtube,
it says so and so destroys someone else 

79
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:35,860
says so and so talks to someone else and
big letters,

80
00:03:35,861 --> 00:03:37,300
you know,
because yeah,

81
00:03:37,301 --> 00:03:38,740
when you talk to people you disagree 
with,

82
00:03:38,741 --> 00:03:42,070
if they don't get angry at you and 
they're not shouting at you,

83
00:03:42,071 --> 00:03:44,330
you know,
you learn a lot of stuff and he can and,

84
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:45,193
and you hone your own arguments and 
sometimes on occasion you change your 

85
00:03:48,431 --> 00:03:48,730
mind.

86
00:03:48,730 --> 00:03:50,380
I mean,
I'm a,

87
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:52,990
I would say if I had to place myself on 
the political spectrum,

88
00:03:52,991 --> 00:03:53,824
I'd be a libertarian,
but one of the reasons I changed on 

89
00:03:56,531 --> 00:03:57,364
abortion took 20 years,
but I had an argument with a guy and I 

90
00:03:59,921 --> 00:04:02,920
lost it and I thought like,
you know what?

91
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:05,380
I can't defend my position against this 
guy,

92
00:04:05,890 --> 00:04:06,723
which is a great teachable moment.
It's a real teachable moment that it 

93
00:04:08,891 --> 00:04:10,240
reminds you to listen to people.
Yeah.

94
00:04:10,450 --> 00:04:14,830
I like that you just used the phrase 
civic religion because one of the things

95
00:04:14,831 --> 00:04:17,560
I've been talking about on here is that 
to me,

96
00:04:17,561 --> 00:04:20,260
leftism has become a secular religion.
Yes.

97
00:04:20,350 --> 00:04:22,180
I've had a couple of people mentioned 
this idea of Peter,

98
00:04:22,181 --> 00:04:23,800
but goes in what's on a couple of weeks 
ago,

99
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,660
uh,
who really explained it well,

100
00:04:25,810 --> 00:04:26,643
but that basically this has become this 
infallible doctrine that you must never 

101
00:04:30,761 --> 00:04:31,594
leave.
And if you do leave you're going to 

102
00:04:33,371 --> 00:04:35,890
basically have a fat wallet on your 
head.

103
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:38,110
Right.
But a civic religion is,

104
00:04:38,230 --> 00:04:40,900
is an interesting phrase because 
basically you were just,

105
00:04:40,901 --> 00:04:43,690
your civic religion in that regard was 
just live and let live.

106
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:45,970
But we're pretty much,
yes basically.

107
00:04:45,971 --> 00:04:49,300
And the idea that you know that the more
government there is,

108
00:04:49,301 --> 00:04:51,850
the less of a person there is,
you know,

109
00:04:51,970 --> 00:04:55,150
that the fact that a woman comes into a 
town and says,

110
00:04:55,151 --> 00:04:58,660
oh I know how to do people's hair and 
the government says we need a permit for

111
00:04:58,661 --> 00:05:02,260
that permit to do hair.
Do you know that that's,

112
00:05:02,290 --> 00:05:04,660
it's just a kind of ongoing,
he's a bald guy issue.

113
00:05:04,661 --> 00:05:06,560
Right,
exactly.

114
00:05:06,910 --> 00:05:07,743
You know,
you read those occasional stories where 

115
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:11,260
some little kid has a lemonade stand and
the police pull up,

116
00:05:11,261 --> 00:05:12,310
you know,
cause he doesn't have a permit.

117
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:15,910
I mean that is the stuff that is so 
offensive to me and,

118
00:05:15,930 --> 00:05:16,763
and it's like I guess over time I've 
kept watching people who told me that 

119
00:05:21,101 --> 00:05:24,160
they were trying to make the world more 
free and more fair,

120
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:26,950
but it always turned out,
not always,

121
00:05:26,951 --> 00:05:27,784
but it often turned out that what they 
were really trying to do is take the 

122
00:05:30,461 --> 00:05:31,294
power away from someone they thought was
a pressing them and take it themselves 

123
00:05:33,731 --> 00:05:35,620
so that they could oppress a person who 
had been oppressing.

124
00:05:35,830 --> 00:05:40,570
And I have like just steadfastly 
maintained that like I want the world to

125
00:05:40,571 --> 00:05:41,404
be more free and more fair.
I'm perfectly willing to accept that 

126
00:05:43,660 --> 00:05:45,880
somebody has been marginalized and needs
to be included,

127
00:05:46,060 --> 00:05:46,893
but I'm not willing to force this other 
guy to like it or to include them or do 

128
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:51,273
serve him or do anything else.
It just seems to me that freedom is a 

129
00:05:54,191 --> 00:05:55,050
balance.
Yeah.

130
00:05:55,210 --> 00:05:57,890
You mentioned something very briefly,
God now,

131
00:05:57,891 --> 00:05:59,160
last time you were on.
Yeah,

132
00:05:59,180 --> 00:06:01,370
we,
we did sort of your whole evolution,

133
00:06:01,371 --> 00:06:04,010
which is really kind of fascinating.
You were born Jewish,

134
00:06:04,011 --> 00:06:08,060
then you are atheist.
For what a bulk of your five years.

135
00:06:08,220 --> 00:06:10,010
For 35 years.
GNOSTIC atheist.

136
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:12,680
And then about how old were you when you
then I was,

137
00:06:12,740 --> 00:06:17,180
I was about 45 when I became an atheist 
when I start to believe in God and I was

138
00:06:17,540 --> 00:06:19,340
just about 50 when I was baptized down.

139
00:06:19,490 --> 00:06:21,380
Yeah.
So how,

140
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:22,710
I just had,
uh,

141
00:06:22,790 --> 00:06:24,260
your friend Dennis prager on,
hey,

142
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:26,480
my friend Dennis prager and,
and Michael Shermer,

143
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:29,600
you know Michael Michael who runs a 
skeptic magazine.

144
00:06:29,630 --> 00:06:30,463
Oh yes.
And we had a great conversation about 

145
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:35,360
belief and morality with God or without 
God.

146
00:06:35,361 --> 00:06:37,010
It was really great.
And at the end we all agreed,

147
00:06:37,190 --> 00:06:37,941
wow,
how nice.

148
00:06:37,941 --> 00:06:38,774
We can sit in a room and not agree on 
everything and we might have dinner 

149
00:06:42,021 --> 00:06:42,854
together,
you know?

150
00:06:43,130 --> 00:06:44,530
Um,
but for,

151
00:06:44,531 --> 00:06:48,290
for you as someone that's traveled in 
and out of religion,

152
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:52,190
uh,
how important is the idea of religion as

153
00:06:52,191 --> 00:06:55,610
a foundational belief for society?
Well,

154
00:06:56,570 --> 00:06:57,403
the only reason to believe in religion 
as far as I'm concerned is because it's 

155
00:06:59,661 --> 00:07:00,530
true.
Okay.

156
00:07:00,531 --> 00:07:01,364
That's the only reason.
So the idea that it's good for society 

157
00:07:04,851 --> 00:07:06,600
or it is,
um,

158
00:07:06,710 --> 00:07:10,190
or conducive to law and order are 
conducive to politeness.

159
00:07:10,580 --> 00:07:13,490
And I'm not interested in believing in a
fantasy just because it works.

160
00:07:13,491 --> 00:07:16,310
I,
and I've always hated arguments based on

161
00:07:16,311 --> 00:07:18,800
practicality when it comes to 
metaphysics.

162
00:07:18,801 --> 00:07:19,820
You know,
to me,

163
00:07:20,020 --> 00:07:20,853
uh,
you can be a nice person and obviously 

164
00:07:21,711 --> 00:07:23,660
without being,
without being a theorist at all,

165
00:07:23,850 --> 00:07:26,660
plenty of Nice atheists are lovely 
people who are atheists.

166
00:07:27,820 --> 00:07:28,653
But,
but I do believe that most of what you 

167
00:07:30,701 --> 00:07:35,140
think is true is illogical.
Without religion,

168
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:36,033
without God.
And many people don't follow their own 

169
00:07:39,521 --> 00:07:40,354
thoughts down to the ground.
And this is true of both atheists and 

170
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:45,820
believers.
And I do believe that.

171
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:49,660
Here's what I think has happened to us.
I think that,

172
00:07:50,410 --> 00:07:52,390
you know,
right around the 17th century,

173
00:07:52,420 --> 00:07:53,253
the science became science.
We the of what we know it to be and 

174
00:07:57,940 --> 00:08:01,960
certain questions were put aside in 
order to do science.

175
00:08:02,140 --> 00:08:03,910
So in other words,
you had people saying,

176
00:08:03,940 --> 00:08:04,773
Hey,
I can measure this and I can predict 

177
00:08:06,011 --> 00:08:09,910
this and then I can heal this and I can 
build this and all these things are such

178
00:08:09,911 --> 00:08:10,570
a great,
you know,

179
00:08:10,570 --> 00:08:11,920
obviously such a great benefit.

180
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:14,050
This is idea from the iphone,
the penicillin,

181
00:08:14,051 --> 00:08:14,884
whatever you're talking about.
All this stuff has revolutionized human 

182
00:08:17,441 --> 00:08:18,274
life.
It was assumed and it was argued that 

183
00:08:21,071 --> 00:08:21,904
there was an underlying logic to science
which precluded God which eliminated 

184
00:08:26,201 --> 00:08:27,034
God.
Even though most of the people who 

185
00:08:27,431 --> 00:08:29,170
invented science,
we're Christians,

186
00:08:29,650 --> 00:08:32,830
there was presumed that there was an 
underlying logic.

187
00:08:32,831 --> 00:08:33,664
So in other words,
they say there's evolution and if 

188
00:08:35,591 --> 00:08:37,750
there's evolution,
everything is random and you go,

189
00:08:37,751 --> 00:08:38,830
well,
okay,

190
00:08:38,831 --> 00:08:39,664
there's evolution but random,
you can't tell randomness from within a 

191
00:08:43,391 --> 00:08:44,224
system.
You can't say I'm in a system and is 

192
00:08:45,011 --> 00:08:45,844
random because obviously the order of 
every system comes from outside the 

193
00:08:48,821 --> 00:08:49,654
system.
I believe that logic is starting to 

194
00:08:51,821 --> 00:08:52,654
collapse.
I believe that logic has played out and 

195
00:08:54,161 --> 00:08:58,560
I believe it has been to us in the 
materialism that basically materialism,

196
00:08:58,561 --> 00:08:59,394
that everything is material.
Everything has a material because the 

197
00:09:00,901 --> 00:09:02,640
material explanation is better than 
that.

198
00:09:03,660 --> 00:09:04,493
That I believe is toxic because it 
doesn't make sense because you cannot 

199
00:09:09,061 --> 00:09:09,894
get from morality to materialism and 
from materialism to morality that I 

200
00:09:15,931 --> 00:09:18,360
believe has had a toxic effect on our 
society.

201
00:09:18,780 --> 00:09:19,613
And so I don't want to replace 
materialism with theism because I think 

202
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:23,993
it's toxic.
I want to do it because I think the 

203
00:09:25,231 --> 00:09:29,700
truth is healing and liberating.
So without going too far down,

204
00:09:29,701 --> 00:09:32,250
just specifically the rabbit hole of 
belief,

205
00:09:32,251 --> 00:09:33,084
cause we've done it a bunch on the show,
and I think I find that even for 

206
00:09:35,620 --> 00:09:36,530
atheists,
unbelievers,

207
00:09:36,570 --> 00:09:38,310
everyone kind of gets to a point where 
it's like,

208
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:39,473
all right,
well I the good ones at least get to a 

209
00:09:40,861 --> 00:09:41,611
point where it's like,
all right,

210
00:09:41,611 --> 00:09:44,340
well that's what I believe in.
And it frames some other stuff.

211
00:09:44,341 --> 00:09:45,174
So let's talk about that.
So without going too far down that 

212
00:09:46,801 --> 00:09:49,290
rabbit hole,
if you think that that those systems are

213
00:09:49,291 --> 00:09:50,160
collapsing,
is that a,

214
00:09:50,161 --> 00:09:50,994
is that really a metaphor or a or a 
bridge to why so many systems seem like 

215
00:09:55,681 --> 00:09:56,710
they're collapsing right now?

216
00:09:57,030 --> 00:09:59,850
Media politics.
I think that's exactly what's happening.

217
00:10:00,250 --> 00:10:01,083
I will sit here and predict to you that 
I believe in the next [inaudible] 

218
00:10:04,060 --> 00:10:05,350
actually,
I believe it's happening now,

219
00:10:05,351 --> 00:10:07,060
but I believe it will erupt at some 
point.

220
00:10:07,390 --> 00:10:11,070
That there's going to be an intellectual
revival of uh,

221
00:10:11,370 --> 00:10:13,390
it's,
it's really Aristotelian thought.

222
00:10:13,391 --> 00:10:14,224
The idea that we're here,
we have a purpose and that bottle has a 

223
00:10:16,451 --> 00:10:18,760
purpose,
that this body has a purpose.

224
00:10:18,761 --> 00:10:22,270
This mine has a purpose that is already 
coming back.

225
00:10:22,271 --> 00:10:23,104
And when you talk to people,
it's really interesting when you go in 

226
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:25,833
to the top universities and you talk to 
the young people there who are the best 

227
00:10:29,171 --> 00:10:31,630
minds of the country.
They're all believers.

228
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:35,560
They don't believe in God,
which wouldn't have been true I think 30

229
00:10:35,561 --> 00:10:36,394
40 years ago.
And this is because ideas play 

230
00:10:38,591 --> 00:10:42,340
themselves out over time.
And this idea that the world is material

231
00:10:42,341 --> 00:10:42,850
is ending.

232
00:10:42,850 --> 00:10:43,683
And yes,
I think a lot of the craziness we're 

233
00:10:45,491 --> 00:10:47,230
seeing and that,
you know,

234
00:10:47,350 --> 00:10:48,183
I hate talking about some of these 
extraordinary political things because 

235
00:10:51,970 --> 00:10:53,380
see,
it sounds like you're being mean.

236
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:58,560
Like it sounds like when I say if a man 
has an operation then turns himself into

237
00:10:59,411 --> 00:11:00,940
a woman,
he's not a woman.

238
00:11:01,510 --> 00:11:03,910
That's a statement of fact in my,
to my mind,

239
00:11:03,940 --> 00:11:04,773
it doesn't mean that he should be abused
or bullied or hurt or anything like 

240
00:11:06,821 --> 00:11:08,170
that.
It's a totally different question.

241
00:11:08,410 --> 00:11:12,910
But some of these questions where 
reality is starting to disappear I think

242
00:11:12,911 --> 00:11:14,830
are built into the fact that this idea 
is collapsing.

243
00:11:15,050 --> 00:11:19,370
It's so interesting because I do believe
that trans people exist.

244
00:11:19,371 --> 00:11:19,851
I mean,
I mean I,

245
00:11:19,851 --> 00:11:20,840
I'm not saying,
yeah,

246
00:11:20,841 --> 00:11:22,300
I don't think you said that they don't 
exist but,

247
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:24,320
but that I believe that it is,
it is a,

248
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:27,080
an actual,
um,

249
00:11:27,940 --> 00:11:28,773
I don't want to say it's an,
it's an actual existential thing for 

250
00:11:30,681 --> 00:11:31,514
this particular person,
but yet I can still go with you in that 

251
00:11:34,821 --> 00:11:35,654
place because it seems like the hysteria
is constantly surrounding it is making 

252
00:11:38,871 --> 00:11:40,670
people question everything.

253
00:11:40,670 --> 00:11:41,503
You know what I mean?
Like if you don't accept Trans people 

254
00:11:42,861 --> 00:11:44,920
the second that everyone else except 
more,

255
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:46,940
not even accept them because I think 
most people accept them.

256
00:11:46,941 --> 00:11:49,160
But if you don't celebrate it 
immediately or,

257
00:11:49,161 --> 00:11:52,080
or wish for a trans child,
it's like they,

258
00:11:52,081 --> 00:11:56,380
they will turn on as you're a transport.
And I think some of the things that to,

259
00:11:56,381 --> 00:11:57,214
uh,
give a child a to hormone treatments or 

260
00:12:00,551 --> 00:12:01,384
any kind of opp operation based on some 
kind of state of preference and that I 

261
00:12:04,511 --> 00:12:06,670
believe is abusive that I,
that I believe is wrong,

262
00:12:06,970 --> 00:12:10,300
but for an adult to decide that he wants
to live his life in any way he wants.

263
00:12:10,301 --> 00:12:13,240
As long as you're not hurting anybody,
it means it means nothing to me.

264
00:12:13,270 --> 00:12:14,590
I mean,
it just means nothing to me.

265
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:16,780
But,
but when he says to me,

266
00:12:16,781 --> 00:12:17,614
you must call me a woman,
then he is taken away my right to 

267
00:12:21,461 --> 00:12:23,370
experience reality as I experienced it.

268
00:12:23,590 --> 00:12:26,100
And that's where he loses his rights as 
this is,

269
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:29,800
this strikes me as you're sort of like a
mature Republican,

270
00:12:30,370 --> 00:12:31,930
you know what I mean?
Like that's what it strikes me.

271
00:12:31,931 --> 00:12:32,764
I was like,
if,

272
00:12:32,830 --> 00:12:36,970
because everything you just said makes 
sense within a conservative viewpoint.

273
00:12:36,971 --> 00:12:37,780
Yeah.
You know,

274
00:12:37,780 --> 00:12:39,820
within a libertarian conservative 
viewpoint,

275
00:12:40,030 --> 00:12:42,670
except there's so few conservatives 
willing to say that.

276
00:12:42,671 --> 00:12:43,630
What you just said.
Well,

277
00:12:43,631 --> 00:12:44,464
you know,
it's funny you asked me at the very 

278
00:12:45,641 --> 00:12:46,474
beginning how I kept hold of some of 
these principles and it didn't occur to 

279
00:12:50,321 --> 00:12:52,660
me until just a moment ago is we were 
talking,

280
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:54,580
I'm talking about one of the things is 
I'm a novelist.

281
00:12:54,610 --> 00:12:56,500
I've lived most of my life writing 
novels.

282
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:59,680
And when you were a novelist,
what you do is you create characters and

283
00:12:59,681 --> 00:13:03,460
each one of these characters has a full 
complete existence and a full,

284
00:13:03,461 --> 00:13:06,490
complete justification.
Even when you're inventing the bad guy,

285
00:13:06,670 --> 00:13:09,730
you realize that in his mind,
the world makes perfect sense and it,

286
00:13:09,820 --> 00:13:11,560
and he makes perfect sense in that 
world.

287
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:12,753
And I actually think of people that way.
You maybe that's a novelist training or 

288
00:13:15,521 --> 00:13:18,640
maybe you start out with that and it 
turns you into a novelist.

289
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:22,630
But I actually think of people that way.
I actually think of somebody who says to

290
00:13:22,631 --> 00:13:23,464
me,
I'm having this inner experience of 

291
00:13:24,401 --> 00:13:27,760
being alienated from my sax,
say,

292
00:13:27,770 --> 00:13:29,530
or whatever,
whatever it is.

293
00:13:29,850 --> 00:13:30,191
I,
you know,

294
00:13:30,191 --> 00:13:31,600
that's,
that doesn't offend me.

295
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:32,890
It doesn't,
I mean,

296
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:33,753
that seems like,
I feel it might be painful and it 

297
00:13:35,771 --> 00:13:36,604
offends me if he says that I have to 
react in a certain way or this guy has 

298
00:13:39,131 --> 00:13:42,430
to react by law in a certain way.
But his experience is like,

299
00:13:42,431 --> 00:13:43,264
it's,
it really is part of the kind of fabric 

300
00:13:44,651 --> 00:13:45,880
of the world.
And I think,

301
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:51,960
I think that there has been too many 
people on both sides of conflated,

302
00:13:52,601 --> 00:13:55,870
what government does with how we live.

303
00:13:56,470 --> 00:13:57,303
So in other words,
I've had this argument with 

304
00:13:59,351 --> 00:14:01,510
conservatives a lot where they'll,
they'll say,

305
00:14:01,511 --> 00:14:03,190
well,
they want to legalize marijuana.

306
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:04,240
And I'll say,
she's fine.

307
00:14:04,241 --> 00:14:06,610
Just don't let people drive with 
marijuana,

308
00:14:06,611 --> 00:14:07,444
you know?
And like what you want to poison 

309
00:14:08,591 --> 00:14:09,850
yourself?
I think it's bad for you,

310
00:14:09,851 --> 00:14:11,320
but you know,
it's none of my business.

311
00:14:11,321 --> 00:14:12,760
Go ahead.
Do you think marijuana is bad?

312
00:14:12,761 --> 00:14:14,530
I do think is bad for you.
But what I've read,

313
00:14:14,531 --> 00:14:15,610
it's bad for it,
but I don't use it.

314
00:14:15,611 --> 00:14:17,530
So I don't really know that much about 
it.

315
00:14:17,620 --> 00:14:20,030
And you don't seem to want to stop 
someone from using cocoon.

316
00:14:20,350 --> 00:14:22,210
Why would I want to stop somebody from 
using it?

317
00:14:22,211 --> 00:14:23,200
Except,
except if,

318
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:24,460
if we were you,
I might say,

319
00:14:24,461 --> 00:14:24,851
Dave,
you know,

320
00:14:24,851 --> 00:14:26,680
I've read some articles,
not good for you,

321
00:14:26,690 --> 00:14:28,300
whatever.
But then,

322
00:14:28,330 --> 00:14:29,163
then you know,
it's coming from me and you can say the 

323
00:14:30,431 --> 00:14:35,380
vape pen,
there's not even room for the lungs.

324
00:14:35,380 --> 00:14:36,820
Come on.
But this is the thing.

325
00:14:36,821 --> 00:14:39,940
Government should not have the right to 
approve or disapprove.

326
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:42,670
It only has the right to protect me from
you.

327
00:14:43,180 --> 00:14:46,240
It shouldn't protect me from me.
If I want to throw myself off a bridge,

328
00:14:46,330 --> 00:14:47,320
you know,
do I think that's right?

329
00:14:47,350 --> 00:14:49,480
No,
but I should be able to throw myself off

330
00:14:49,481 --> 00:14:50,830
a bridge.
What?

331
00:14:50,831 --> 00:14:53,720
I shouldn't be able to do.
The best example I was using,

332
00:14:53,721 --> 00:14:56,930
the seat seatbelts versus a cell phone.
You know,

333
00:14:56,931 --> 00:14:59,360
when you use a cell phone in a car,
you're endangering me.

334
00:14:59,690 --> 00:15:02,800
When you don't use your seatbelt,
you want to fly through the windshield.

335
00:15:02,801 --> 00:15:05,180
It's none of my business.
And that I,

336
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:06,113
you know,
I,

337
00:15:06,140 --> 00:15:08,990
I knew that libertarians take some 
extreme crazy positions,

338
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:11,030
but in general,
free markets,

339
00:15:11,031 --> 00:15:13,520
free minds seems to me that the way 
forward in Canada.

340
00:15:13,730 --> 00:15:14,563
So I do see the,
the freedom thing gaining traction for 

341
00:15:17,481 --> 00:15:20,510
sure.
Even the way that I've talked a lot,

342
00:15:20,511 --> 00:15:23,540
obviously about classical liberalism and
libertarianism in all of this,

343
00:15:23,870 --> 00:15:25,610
I see that now.
I see it,

344
00:15:25,611 --> 00:15:27,650
I just see it in society and on social 
media.

345
00:15:27,651 --> 00:15:28,484
I see it more in a cooler fashion than 
it would be if it was maybe coming from 

346
00:15:33,261 --> 00:15:34,094
Ted Cruz or something.
Like I see it's gaining a little 

347
00:15:36,081 --> 00:15:38,210
traction in,
in a bigger way.

348
00:15:38,450 --> 00:15:39,920
And I'm not,
certainly not all because of me,

349
00:15:39,921 --> 00:15:41,450
obviously.
Um,

350
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:42,433
well because of you.

351
00:15:44,340 --> 00:15:45,173
But I liked what you said about that 
there'll be an intellectual resurgens 

352
00:15:47,461 --> 00:15:50,240
too because I am starting to see a 
little bit of that,

353
00:15:50,540 --> 00:15:51,373
that it's starting to feel cool to have 
knowledge again as opposed to the 15 

354
00:15:58,521 --> 00:15:59,354
years of endless reality tv and just the
worst of us constantly and endless 

355
00:16:04,071 --> 00:16:04,904
bickering and one upping.
I think we're starting to turn a corner 

356
00:16:07,071 --> 00:16:07,950
on that,
which you,

357
00:16:08,170 --> 00:16:10,310
which I've been waiting for for a long 
time.

358
00:16:11,260 --> 00:16:12,440
It's an awful,
you know,

359
00:16:12,441 --> 00:16:15,350
I recently spoke,
I don't get to speak to often,

360
00:16:15,410 --> 00:16:16,520
uh,
at places bark,

361
00:16:16,521 --> 00:16:19,190
partly because like ignore the request 
and out.

362
00:16:19,191 --> 00:16:21,040
Now I have somebody who does it,
so maybe I'll speak speaking,

363
00:16:21,260 --> 00:16:22,093
I spoke at Oberlin recently,
which is a deeply like the heart of 

364
00:16:24,741 --> 00:16:29,720
liberal darkness and went in there and I
was,

365
00:16:29,780 --> 00:16:32,770
I felt that these children who were my 
age,

366
00:16:32,790 --> 00:16:33,830
they now look like children.

367
00:16:33,830 --> 00:16:34,663
You know,
I felt that they were being almost 

368
00:16:37,700 --> 00:16:38,533
abused by their heritage of,
of knowledge of wisdom was being taken 

369
00:16:45,411 --> 00:16:47,300
away from them.
That if,

370
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:49,340
you know,
you should come out of college,

371
00:16:49,341 --> 00:16:51,230
you should have read some shakespeare.
You know,

372
00:16:51,410 --> 00:16:53,990
and you should have read all of some of 
the great writers.

373
00:16:53,991 --> 00:16:55,550
You should know some of these great 
thinkers,

374
00:16:55,551 --> 00:16:56,384
Plato and people like that.
And you should know them without the 

375
00:16:58,131 --> 00:17:00,440
professors standing between you and the 
guy.

376
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:02,870
You know,
Shakespeare has traveled through time,

377
00:17:02,871 --> 00:17:06,590
400 years to bring you the wisdom,
a unique vision of the world.

378
00:17:06,890 --> 00:17:11,810
I don't need a professor doing anything 
but explaining the context to me,

379
00:17:11,811 --> 00:17:12,644
you know,
and they have this thing called theory 

380
00:17:13,251 --> 00:17:14,780
and all this.
And you know,

381
00:17:14,781 --> 00:17:17,150
it opened when there were,
it was a black dorm.

382
00:17:17,750 --> 00:17:18,583
I mean,
Martin Luther King would roll over in 

383
00:17:19,761 --> 00:17:20,670
his grave,
you know,

384
00:17:20,990 --> 00:17:23,210
there was,
there were kids who showed up,

385
00:17:23,270 --> 00:17:24,290
uh,
you know,

386
00:17:24,380 --> 00:17:28,700
kind of aggressively displaying their 
sexual proclivities and then,

387
00:17:29,020 --> 00:17:31,160
um,
heckling me from the crowd.

388
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:32,180
And,
and I kept saying,

389
00:17:32,181 --> 00:17:34,820
you know what,
hold your question and I'm going to,

390
00:17:34,940 --> 00:17:36,640
I'm going to discuss everything you want
to discuss.

391
00:17:36,770 --> 00:17:38,820
And then the minute I finished and,
uh,

392
00:17:38,900 --> 00:17:40,010
talking,
they ran away,

393
00:17:40,550 --> 00:17:41,141
you know,
and,

394
00:17:41,141 --> 00:17:42,920
and I thought,
these are that something.

395
00:17:42,980 --> 00:17:44,350
It's just right there.
You know?

396
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:45,513
And,
and what was interesting was a lot of 

397
00:17:46,611 --> 00:17:49,310
the liberal kids who are just ordinary 
little,

398
00:17:49,370 --> 00:17:51,750
they state and we had really good 
conversations.

399
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:53,260
Only the hecklers ran away.
Yeah.

400
00:17:53,690 --> 00:17:55,770
And so I just think these kids are being
deprived.

401
00:17:55,771 --> 00:17:57,750
They're being deprived of their 
intellectual heritage.

402
00:17:57,930 --> 00:18:02,930
They're being deprived of the idea that,
that I can't fix their problems.

403
00:18:03,991 --> 00:18:07,560
What they're being told is that they're 
unhappy because,

404
00:18:08,070 --> 00:18:08,903
um,
they'd be unhappy because of the way I 

405
00:18:10,201 --> 00:18:12,360
treat them or you treat them or society 
treats them.

406
00:18:12,510 --> 00:18:14,640
They're unhappy because of things inside
themselves.

407
00:18:14,641 --> 00:18:15,474
And then there was this,
this gay guy yelling at me the whole 

408
00:18:19,231 --> 00:18:21,390
time.
And at,

409
00:18:21,510 --> 00:18:22,343
at one point I mentioned to somebody 
else in another context that I was 

410
00:18:24,961 --> 00:18:28,740
actually a supporter of gay rights and 
he let out this loud,

411
00:18:28,741 --> 00:18:30,230
we'll thank you.
And I thought,

412
00:18:30,231 --> 00:18:32,520
you know,
I thought you think people don't like it

413
00:18:32,521 --> 00:18:34,410
because you're gay.
They don't like it cause you're allowed.

414
00:18:37,380 --> 00:18:40,800
That's what a quality is all about.
That you just want people to be equal so

415
00:18:40,801 --> 00:18:43,440
that you can treat them in a shitty is 
you treat everybody else.

416
00:18:43,441 --> 00:18:44,274
I don't want special treatment for being
gay and give me equal treatment and now 

417
00:18:48,151 --> 00:18:50,430
judge me according to exactly.
And I think this,

418
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:52,140
this is come,
you know,

419
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:56,070
I see guys like this,
a ton of Casey Coats and he writes these

420
00:18:56,071 --> 00:18:57,210
letters to the sun.
You need,

421
00:18:57,211 --> 00:19:00,660
you need to be made good for the sins of
the past.

422
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:04,590
What a terrible thing to tell a child.
Nobody can solve the sins of the past.

423
00:19:05,220 --> 00:19:07,500
That's the whole point of the past.
It's past,

424
00:19:07,501 --> 00:19:08,334
you know,
and you cannot fix the things that were 

425
00:19:09,871 --> 00:19:11,760
done to people.
You cannot fix history.

426
00:19:12,090 --> 00:19:15,780
You can't pay people back for things 
that happen to people who are dead.

427
00:19:15,930 --> 00:19:17,370
You know?
That's the,

428
00:19:17,430 --> 00:19:20,190
that's the tragedy of,
of a fallen world.

429
00:19:20,190 --> 00:19:20,590
You know,
that,

430
00:19:20,590 --> 00:19:22,980
that things are written into the fabric 
of life.

431
00:19:23,310 --> 00:19:26,280
And to tell somebody that,
that he's not going to be happy until he

432
00:19:26,281 --> 00:19:29,520
gets paid back for slavery or whatever 
it is.

433
00:19:29,980 --> 00:19:32,460
It's condemning him to misery.
Yeah.

434
00:19:32,461 --> 00:19:33,294
It's,
it's just sounding because it never 

435
00:19:33,811 --> 00:19:35,310
stops.
The payback,

436
00:19:35,700 --> 00:19:37,290
the payback,
whatever it is.

437
00:19:37,710 --> 00:19:39,270
There's never a moment where you go,
okay,

438
00:19:39,300 --> 00:19:40,133
well we,
we got to where we're supposed to get 

439
00:19:41,550 --> 00:19:43,940
and now we don't need anything else 
anymore.

440
00:19:43,950 --> 00:19:45,480
It just,
by human logic,

441
00:19:45,481 --> 00:19:46,314
it doesn't make sense.
And this used to be the question of 

442
00:19:47,491 --> 00:19:48,810
education.
What is the good life?

443
00:19:49,560 --> 00:19:51,110
What's conducive to happiness?
What does,

444
00:19:51,170 --> 00:19:52,160
you know?
What makes you miserable?

445
00:19:52,350 --> 00:19:54,270
That used to be what you discussed and 
it can't.

446
00:19:54,271 --> 00:19:57,060
The answer can't be my happiness depends
on you.

447
00:19:57,061 --> 00:19:59,550
Be Nice to me because you're going to be
what you are,

448
00:19:59,551 --> 00:19:59,970
you know?

449
00:19:59,970 --> 00:20:00,830
I'm curious,
what was,

450
00:20:00,850 --> 00:20:03,510
what group invited you at Oberlin?
The some,

451
00:20:03,511 --> 00:20:06,510
it was a bunch of Republicans who was 
like the 15 republican's.

452
00:20:06,511 --> 00:20:07,344
Yeah.
I kind of surprised they just wanted a 

453
00:20:09,841 --> 00:20:12,000
16th guy to finally show up.
They were like,

454
00:20:12,030 --> 00:20:13,530
they were like trolls,
you know,

455
00:20:13,531 --> 00:20:14,364
they were kind of,
they wanted me to come and make fun of 

456
00:20:16,230 --> 00:20:19,100
the left and I didn't.
And I thought they,

457
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:21,720
even though the whole thing wouldn't be 
incredibly well,

458
00:20:21,721 --> 00:20:25,170
I actually just talked about ideas and 
people listened and I thought,

459
00:20:25,171 --> 00:20:26,010
well,
that's a victory.

460
00:20:26,011 --> 00:20:26,844
Right?
But he felt that the conservatives are 

461
00:20:29,220 --> 00:20:32,910
so sick of being shouted at,
that they've just turned into,

462
00:20:32,911 --> 00:20:34,090
uh,
into trolls.

463
00:20:34,091 --> 00:20:34,924
They want to mock the other song,
which I think is kind of interesting 

464
00:20:36,721 --> 00:20:37,554
because I say it all the time,
but I only get invited now to colleges 

465
00:20:41,490 --> 00:20:42,323
by the young Republican's are the 
Libertarians and smarter students for 

466
00:20:44,971 --> 00:20:45,930
liberty or et Cetera,
et cetera.

467
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:48,940
All of these things that are technically
right,

468
00:20:49,870 --> 00:20:51,940
even though they don't,
they don't seem to mind that I'm gay,

469
00:20:51,941 --> 00:20:52,774
married and pro choice and against the 
death penalty and a litany of other 

470
00:20:56,561 --> 00:20:57,490
things,
and then it's like,

471
00:20:57,491 --> 00:20:57,810
well,
who?

472
00:20:57,810 --> 00:21:01,510
Who is the tolerance side?
I don't get any invites from anyone.

473
00:21:01,540 --> 00:21:02,373
No,
no young Democrats or progressives up 

474
00:21:04,451 --> 00:21:06,460
tomorrow,
whoever called me and been like,

475
00:21:06,461 --> 00:21:06,821
Dave,
you know,

476
00:21:06,821 --> 00:21:09,070
we actually see you criticizing her 
side,

477
00:21:09,071 --> 00:21:12,490
but let's come and talk about it.
But I'm getting a ton of love from those

478
00:21:12,491 --> 00:21:13,810
other guys who by the way,
you're right.

479
00:21:13,990 --> 00:21:15,530
There's a lot of trolls in that too.
They,

480
00:21:15,531 --> 00:21:17,620
they've started being the funny people 
too.

481
00:21:17,650 --> 00:21:19,500
That's Richard.
Is that for you as a,

482
00:21:19,501 --> 00:21:22,930
as a screenwriter and a guy that's 
bounced between Hollywood and politics,

483
00:21:23,110 --> 00:21:26,890
is that fascinating to you though?
That is starting to become funny.

484
00:21:27,020 --> 00:21:28,060
It's a joy.

485
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:28,751
I mean,
I always,

486
00:21:28,751 --> 00:21:29,584
my,
my joke used to be that the reason 

487
00:21:31,031 --> 00:21:33,580
conservatives aren't funny is because 
liberals have no sense of humor,

488
00:21:35,620 --> 00:21:36,453
but it is,
it is a joy to see conservatives 

489
00:21:39,521 --> 00:21:42,310
becoming funny and becoming the people 
of freedom.

490
00:21:42,460 --> 00:21:43,293
Because let's face it,
conservatism in the old style did have 

491
00:21:46,571 --> 00:21:48,700
its oppressive elements and it did have,
it's kind of,

492
00:21:48,970 --> 00:21:49,481
uh,
you know,

493
00:21:49,481 --> 00:21:50,314
when,
whenever people are in charge of the 

494
00:21:51,521 --> 00:21:53,740
culture,
as conservatives were until the 60s,

495
00:21:53,741 --> 00:21:54,700
basically,
uh,

496
00:21:54,701 --> 00:21:56,200
you know,
they abused that control.

497
00:21:56,201 --> 00:21:58,780
That's part of,
that's part of power corrupting.

498
00:21:59,170 --> 00:22:00,003
And there was that element in,
and there still is among conservatives 

499
00:22:03,491 --> 00:22:05,410
that somehow,
you know,

500
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:06,353
uh,
you are destroying the republic by not 

501
00:22:08,531 --> 00:22:09,910
being exactly,
you know,

502
00:22:09,911 --> 00:22:12,160
a,
a Bible beating Christian or whatever it

503
00:22:12,161 --> 00:22:13,000
is.
And,

504
00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:15,430
and that's just largely lifted,
you know,

505
00:22:15,431 --> 00:22:17,770
I mean,
so this is actually an effect,

506
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:18,993
I would say a positive effect that the 
sixties revolutionist haven't 

507
00:22:23,021 --> 00:22:23,730
conservatives.

508
00:22:23,730 --> 00:22:24,563
This is day two of loosened up.
Nobody wants to go back to wearing ties 

509
00:22:27,341 --> 00:22:30,040
to baseball games.
Nobody wants to go back to,

510
00:22:30,070 --> 00:22:30,910
um,
you know,

511
00:22:30,990 --> 00:22:33,010
uh,
a rigid life where you can't be,

512
00:22:33,130 --> 00:22:33,671
look,
I,

513
00:22:33,671 --> 00:22:35,020
you know,
take feminism.

514
00:22:35,140 --> 00:22:35,973
Feminism right now to me,
like environmentalism is largely the 

515
00:22:38,741 --> 00:22:39,940
enemy.
They are,

516
00:22:40,300 --> 00:22:42,550
the feminists are insane.
They're not about,

517
00:22:42,580 --> 00:22:43,413
you know,
actual sexual relations between people 

518
00:22:45,161 --> 00:22:47,950
just like the environmentalist aren't 
actually about conservation and all this

519
00:22:47,951 --> 00:22:48,784
stuff,
but nobody wants to go back to a world 

520
00:22:49,811 --> 00:22:52,660
where a woman doesn't have,
can't choose what life she wants.

521
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:54,220
I mean,
I always say to people,

522
00:22:54,221 --> 00:22:55,054
if you draw a circle that's called 
individualism and a circle of is called 

523
00:22:57,431 --> 00:23:01,090
feminism in that place where the Venn 
diagram where they meet,

524
00:23:01,320 --> 00:23:02,070
you know,
I'll,

525
00:23:02,070 --> 00:23:05,050
I'll agree with feminism.
Everything outside of that I don't agree

526
00:23:05,051 --> 00:23:05,884
with,
but nobody wants to go back to a world 

527
00:23:07,091 --> 00:23:11,110
where a woman can't be fully whoever she
wants to be and nobody wants a,

528
00:23:11,111 --> 00:23:14,470
certainly wants to go back to a racially
segregated world except the left.

529
00:23:15,410 --> 00:23:17,110
Right.
They oddly are the ones that are pushing

530
00:23:17,111 --> 00:23:17,944
these things.
Like you just described it overland and 

531
00:23:19,271 --> 00:23:20,670
so and so.
The,

532
00:23:20,671 --> 00:23:21,504
the modern right is to some degree a 
function of certain things that left 

533
00:23:27,641 --> 00:23:32,641
this have also brought to the table and 
have now become the party of freedom.

534
00:23:32,981 --> 00:23:34,540
The party of hilarity.
You know,

535
00:23:34,541 --> 00:23:35,374
I mean you do not laugh a lot when you 
were around leftist and when you 

536
00:23:37,630 --> 00:23:39,210
actually,
when you watch Samantha B on,

537
00:23:39,350 --> 00:23:41,560
it's not funny.
It's not funny.

538
00:23:41,580 --> 00:23:44,320
It's painful.
It's dead at that a trump.

539
00:23:46,210 --> 00:23:47,043
Yeah.
You got to put it in the right and they 

540
00:23:49,011 --> 00:23:51,850
have to bleep it cause it's on TV.
So even if the body man,

541
00:23:51,851 --> 00:23:53,670
anything to you,
you would really exciting.

542
00:23:53,690 --> 00:23:55,910
Fuck yeah,
no,

543
00:23:55,911 --> 00:23:57,950
this is,
this is the funny thing about it is like

544
00:23:58,110 --> 00:23:58,943
when you hear them doing that,
that the cursing and the anger and the 

545
00:24:01,701 --> 00:24:03,130
rage and a lot of laughs there.

546
00:24:03,380 --> 00:24:05,650
So then when you see,
uh,

547
00:24:06,050 --> 00:24:08,120
people on the right,
so like a jeff sessions,

548
00:24:08,121 --> 00:24:08,954
cause there's a lot of talk that he's 
going to go in and try to close medical 

549
00:24:10,971 --> 00:24:11,804
marijuana dispensaries.
Now you just made it very clear you 

550
00:24:13,881 --> 00:24:14,714
don't smoke marijuana,
you prefer everything being equal with 

551
00:24:17,241 --> 00:24:18,074
people didn't for health reasons.
And I think there's a lot of debate 

552
00:24:19,821 --> 00:24:21,980
around that.
But I'm just going with what you said.

553
00:24:22,580 --> 00:24:26,020
When you see that as a small government 
guy and a state's rights guy and a,

554
00:24:26,030 --> 00:24:26,863
and a libertarian,
that must be the part of the right that 

555
00:24:28,941 --> 00:24:29,960
you don't like.
Right?

556
00:24:30,010 --> 00:24:30,843
Yeah.
I don't even know why you would bother 

557
00:24:32,151 --> 00:24:32,871
with that.
I mean,

558
00:24:32,871 --> 00:24:35,380
I don't know why there should be medical
marijuana dispensaries.

559
00:24:35,390 --> 00:24:37,580
Why shouldn't just be like a liquor 
store?

560
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:38,593
You know,
you can't buy it if you're not 18 or 

561
00:24:39,651 --> 00:24:40,484
whatever,
the proper ages and you can't use it 

562
00:24:42,861 --> 00:24:45,140
behind the wheel of a car and all those 
things.

563
00:24:45,500 --> 00:24:48,250
And then we get to tax tax it,
you know,

564
00:24:48,251 --> 00:24:49,310
and,
and get all that money.

565
00:24:49,750 --> 00:24:50,583
So,
but I don't know why that should be 

566
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:55,010
what's bothering him,
you know?

567
00:24:55,011 --> 00:24:56,990
I mean,
I really liked jeff sessions.

568
00:24:56,991 --> 00:25:00,110
I'm a pro jeff sessions guy.
I think he's going to be a great age,

569
00:25:00,111 --> 00:25:01,280
you know,
I think he's going to do.

570
00:25:01,281 --> 00:25:03,170
But are you concerned about that state 
stuff?

571
00:25:03,171 --> 00:25:04,730
Because to me that's one of the biggest 
issues.

572
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:06,050
The states' rights.
Yeah,

573
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:07,320
absolutely.
Absolutely.

574
00:25:07,321 --> 00:25:08,154
And one of the things that's kind of a 
joy about the trump era is all these 

575
00:25:10,971 --> 00:25:13,430
liberal states suing the federal 
government.

576
00:25:13,431 --> 00:25:14,264
Because I think I win that either way,
either because the federal government 

577
00:25:16,761 --> 00:25:20,340
gets the conservative thing in there or 
I win because they get states.

578
00:25:20,341 --> 00:25:21,020
Right.
So,

579
00:25:21,020 --> 00:25:23,300
and that's why the whole that's,
I've now been saying every week,

580
00:25:23,301 --> 00:25:24,134
I mean the whole chess board is just 
throwing up the traditional left right 

581
00:25:26,511 --> 00:25:27,440
thing barely makes sense.

582
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:30,890
It's authoritarians and Libertarians and
allies,

583
00:25:30,940 --> 00:25:31,773
you know,
coming together in some interesting 

584
00:25:32,991 --> 00:25:33,824
spots.
I describe it as like being in a room 

585
00:25:35,211 --> 00:25:36,044
with a gravity has gone out of the room 
and all the furniture around and you 

586
00:25:39,741 --> 00:25:41,060
know,
you don't know where it's gonna land.

587
00:25:41,090 --> 00:25:41,923
And I understand some of these guys like
national review and even my pal Ben 

588
00:25:45,650 --> 00:25:45,891
Shapiro,
you know,

589
00:25:45,891 --> 00:25:49,130
I understand that they're worried about 
where the furniture may fall.

590
00:25:49,580 --> 00:25:50,413
Uh,
I'm kind of optimistic and I'm not sure 

591
00:25:52,641 --> 00:25:55,670
how much of that is constitutional.
How much of the does observational,

592
00:25:55,671 --> 00:25:56,504
you know?
Right.

593
00:25:56,600 --> 00:25:59,480
But I do feel that good things are 
coming.

594
00:25:59,481 --> 00:26:03,180
I look to the generations down the line.
And what,

595
00:26:03,181 --> 00:26:07,550
what I see coming up is kind of a 
cultural liberalism,

596
00:26:07,940 --> 00:26:10,130
which I agree with,
but,

597
00:26:10,340 --> 00:26:14,360
but an understanding that freedom is 
economic and freedom is governmental.

598
00:26:14,361 --> 00:26:17,570
And if the government can tell you what 
to like and what to do,

599
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:18,433
you know,
it's just,

600
00:26:18,490 --> 00:26:19,520
it's,
it's not,

601
00:26:19,521 --> 00:26:21,680
you're not free and they're not that 
smart.

602
00:26:21,830 --> 00:26:23,210
I'm going to give you a rare choice 
here.

603
00:26:23,211 --> 00:26:24,044
Do we,
do we want to go media first or trump 

604
00:26:25,551 --> 00:26:28,520
first from here?
This is a choose your own adventure.

605
00:26:28,630 --> 00:26:31,070
It's really interesting because it's 
kind of the same thing.

606
00:26:31,071 --> 00:26:32,210
Let's start with trump.
All right,

607
00:26:32,211 --> 00:26:34,850
let's go trump first.
So when I hear you talk about trump,

608
00:26:35,150 --> 00:26:36,970
so I was with you on election night 
actually.

609
00:26:36,971 --> 00:26:39,200
We were,
we were at the daily wire offices and it

610
00:26:39,201 --> 00:26:40,180
was me,
you and,

611
00:26:40,181 --> 00:26:43,190
and Shapiro and uh,
who else do I build?

612
00:26:43,191 --> 00:26:44,024
Widow was there and he was a funny night
because we were all having very mixed 

613
00:26:47,251 --> 00:26:49,230
emotions.
I voted for Gary Johnson.

614
00:26:49,231 --> 00:26:50,610
I didn't really want either one of them 
too,

615
00:26:50,611 --> 00:26:55,200
when ben was alternately like thrilled 
and depressed because,

616
00:26:55,201 --> 00:26:56,460
you know,
but he didn't vote for trump.

617
00:26:56,490 --> 00:26:57,720
But he,
but he didn't vote for trump.

618
00:26:58,230 --> 00:27:00,020
Has he publicly said who we voted for 
it?

619
00:27:00,680 --> 00:27:01,830
I can't remember.
Yeah,

620
00:27:01,890 --> 00:27:02,840
I'm not sure.
It actually comes from,

621
00:27:02,850 --> 00:27:03,900
you could,
you did vote for trump.

622
00:27:03,901 --> 00:27:04,734
I didn't vote for trump at the last 
minute and I made this very public 

623
00:27:07,230 --> 00:27:09,810
decision and I explained my reasons and 
all that.

624
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:10,401
Yeah.
And,

625
00:27:10,401 --> 00:27:12,450
and then the fourth guy that was with 
us,

626
00:27:12,451 --> 00:27:14,310
Bill Whittle,
was a huge trump supporter.

627
00:27:14,311 --> 00:27:15,144
And he was talking about the things that
we're talking about now that this whole 

628
00:27:16,621 --> 00:27:18,210
thing has been flipped in that there's 
room.

629
00:27:18,211 --> 00:27:19,044
Right?
Okay.

630
00:27:19,170 --> 00:27:21,090
So since the election,
when I watched your videos,

631
00:27:21,091 --> 00:27:21,924
you strike me as one of the only people 
making any sense on trump because you 

632
00:27:24,091 --> 00:27:24,924
don't strike me as a,
as a pure fan boy and think that he can 

633
00:27:27,451 --> 00:27:29,670
go out into fifth avenue and shoot 
someone.

634
00:27:29,671 --> 00:27:33,660
You might turn on him for that,
but you also don't strike me as,

635
00:27:33,661 --> 00:27:36,090
as just what is what most people are at 
the moment,

636
00:27:36,091 --> 00:27:38,160
which is just this hysterical lunacy.

637
00:27:38,630 --> 00:27:40,500
Um,
just hilarious.

638
00:27:40,710 --> 00:27:41,543
I,
I write columns a lot of times a PJ 

639
00:27:44,311 --> 00:27:47,280
media and I'll say,
well,

640
00:27:47,281 --> 00:27:51,770
trump has done this right and this wrong
and I get this vicious attacks.

641
00:27:52,020 --> 00:27:52,853
You know,
you're an antique trumper and they'll 

642
00:27:53,751 --> 00:27:58,600
let you know you're a cock cock cannot.
And then I go to work and uh,

643
00:27:58,650 --> 00:28:02,170
everybody there who was kind of anti 
trump yells at me for selling myself.

644
00:28:02,870 --> 00:28:03,703
So I get it from all sides.
People always think we're selling 

645
00:28:05,701 --> 00:28:07,660
ourselves though.
Doesn't that seem odd to you?

646
00:28:07,750 --> 00:28:09,960
Will people think if they disagree with 
you,

647
00:28:09,990 --> 00:28:11,460
your,
their reasons irrational,

648
00:28:11,670 --> 00:28:13,320
your reasons or personal?
That's what they think,

649
00:28:13,350 --> 00:28:14,183
right?
You're always doing it for money or for 

650
00:28:15,721 --> 00:28:16,554
some other reward somewhere,
but they do it just sure it's pure 

651
00:28:19,981 --> 00:28:22,290
intellect that has gotten them to the 
whole thing,

652
00:28:22,291 --> 00:28:23,800
but you don't have that intellect.
Yeah.

653
00:28:23,820 --> 00:28:24,653
And so it is funny too,
cause a lot of the guys I work with are 

654
00:28:26,401 --> 00:28:28,370
younger than me and I always look at 
them think,

655
00:28:28,830 --> 00:28:32,910
do you think maybe it's occurred to me 
to examine my own motos yeah.

656
00:28:33,540 --> 00:28:36,060
Well that that concept though,
before we dive fully into trump,

657
00:28:36,061 --> 00:28:39,390
that concept of impugning your 
intellectual opponents motives.

658
00:28:39,660 --> 00:28:42,820
I think it's such a sad thing that 
seeped into everything and slash or,

659
00:28:42,821 --> 00:28:45,810
and it doesn't teach you.
I mean there's some people obviously who

660
00:28:45,811 --> 00:28:48,180
were so corrupt that it's obvious and 
true,

661
00:28:48,450 --> 00:28:51,480
but people are trying to find their way.
Most people in you know,

662
00:28:51,481 --> 00:28:52,780
in the middle are trying to find their 
way.

663
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:54,440
So trump.
Okay,

664
00:28:54,500 --> 00:28:56,640
so,
so make some sense out of trump.

665
00:28:56,670 --> 00:28:57,503
Okay.
What are the people that voted for 

666
00:28:58,411 --> 00:29:01,680
trump?
Because I genuinely thought that Hillary

667
00:29:01,680 --> 00:29:04,710
Clinton was a threat to the American 
experiment.

668
00:29:04,740 --> 00:29:06,900
I mean,
I'm not over I that I usually don't talk

669
00:29:06,901 --> 00:29:07,734
in those big terms,
but she did not believe in free speech 

670
00:29:09,871 --> 00:29:10,704
or hatred of the citizens.
United ruling was just indicated to me 

671
00:29:14,731 --> 00:29:16,920
that she believed the speech should be 
controlled.

672
00:29:17,130 --> 00:29:17,963
There are four justices on the supreme 
court who have signed onto a theory of 

673
00:29:22,561 --> 00:29:23,394
the first amendment that says 
essentially that it does not guarantee 

674
00:29:26,251 --> 00:29:27,084
you the right to speak.
What it guarantees is that the 

675
00:29:29,641 --> 00:29:34,380
government should control speech so that
our values continue to be upheld.

676
00:29:34,650 --> 00:29:36,450
That's a very dangerous,
sick,

677
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:40,410
stupid and wrong theory.
One more judge,

678
00:29:40,630 --> 00:29:42,430
I don't believe all of them would sign 
on everything,

679
00:29:42,460 --> 00:29:43,293
but one more judge.
And that obviously there was an open 

680
00:29:44,831 --> 00:29:47,620
seat and we could have lost the first 
amendment.

681
00:29:47,621 --> 00:29:49,210
I don't believe that was the most likely
thing,

682
00:29:49,211 --> 00:29:50,044
but it could have happened.
So can you take the counterpoint on 

683
00:29:51,701 --> 00:29:53,710
that,
just just for devil's advocate,

684
00:29:53,711 --> 00:29:55,450
the people that would argue against you 
on,

685
00:29:55,570 --> 00:29:57,200
on citizens united?
Well,

686
00:29:57,640 --> 00:29:58,031
oh,
well,

687
00:29:58,031 --> 00:30:00,430
citizens united just says that if you 
form a corporation,

688
00:30:00,431 --> 00:30:02,650
if you and I form the Reuben clave 
corporation,

689
00:30:02,740 --> 00:30:04,150
we don't lose our right to free speech.

690
00:30:04,450 --> 00:30:05,283
I mean,
what happened was citizens united put 

691
00:30:06,491 --> 00:30:09,310
out a documentary against Hillary and 
they said,

692
00:30:09,311 --> 00:30:12,160
well that's campaigning so you can't put
it on the air.

693
00:30:12,161 --> 00:30:13,210
And they said,
it's free speech.

694
00:30:13,211 --> 00:30:14,530
We can.
And they said,

695
00:30:14,531 --> 00:30:15,364
well,
you're a corporation so you don't have 

696
00:30:15,821 --> 00:30:17,350
the rights in the New York Times signed 
onto that.

697
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:18,610
The New York Times said,
no,

698
00:30:18,700 --> 00:30:22,210
we are a corporation has free speech 
because we were oppressed corporation.

699
00:30:22,390 --> 00:30:24,370
But your corporation does not have,
you know,

700
00:30:24,520 --> 00:30:25,353
it's nuts and that's,
it's typical of the left because as I 

701
00:30:28,031 --> 00:30:28,960
say,
I believe their,

702
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:31,870
their reasons,
their logic is collapsing.

703
00:30:32,020 --> 00:30:35,680
So they have to shout you down.
They can invite they've Ruben to Oberlin

704
00:30:35,681 --> 00:30:36,071
there,
you know,

705
00:30:36,071 --> 00:30:37,750
to,
to talk with the left.

706
00:30:37,870 --> 00:30:39,880
They can't because they know their 
argument is over.

707
00:30:40,360 --> 00:30:41,193
So I voted for trump,
5% of my mind and in my mind 5% I was 

708
00:30:45,521 --> 00:30:47,200
thinking the guy's Hitler,
you know,

709
00:30:47,530 --> 00:30:48,363
there's a 5% chance I am making the 
biggest mistake of my life and I'm 

710
00:30:51,700 --> 00:30:52,720
pretty high percentage.

711
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:54,850
If you're going Hitler,
you know your apps.

712
00:30:54,910 --> 00:30:55,743
When when Reagan was elected,
I remember having friends called me up 

713
00:30:58,121 --> 00:30:59,020
and saying,
is this the end?

714
00:30:59,021 --> 00:30:59,690
I said,
no,

715
00:30:59,690 --> 00:31:00,640
he's a good guy.
You know,

716
00:31:00,641 --> 00:31:02,820
it will be fine.
I'll be on the other side for a while.

717
00:31:02,830 --> 00:31:03,420
You know,
you,

718
00:31:03,420 --> 00:31:05,350
you will die when people call me up with
this.

719
00:31:05,351 --> 00:31:10,351
I was going like 95% and I think,
you know,

720
00:31:11,480 --> 00:31:12,430
like,
like you said,

721
00:31:12,431 --> 00:31:16,280
that's a big percentage if you're 
talking a genuine authoritarian tire.

722
00:31:16,860 --> 00:31:17,693
I just thought the bet was worth it 
because I thought that Hillary was the 

723
00:31:21,131 --> 00:31:25,240
end of the American experiment in the 
piece fullest possible way.

724
00:31:25,270 --> 00:31:26,103
Like,
you know,

725
00:31:26,110 --> 00:31:26,943
they,
there's something in sports called 

726
00:31:27,731 --> 00:31:28,564
losing comfortably where you don't even 
notice you're losing and then the game 

727
00:31:30,701 --> 00:31:33,760
is over and it's done.
That's what I thought she was.

728
00:31:33,820 --> 00:31:34,653
And,
and so I thought that it was worth the 

729
00:31:35,621 --> 00:31:40,621
risk and I have been largely delighted 
with how good he's been.

730
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:44,433
Now.
That doesn't mean I think he's been 

731
00:31:45,970 --> 00:31:46,803
great.
It just means that I was really worried 

732
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:52,570
that he was going to be really bad and 
instead he's been pretty good,

733
00:31:52,600 --> 00:31:53,780
you know,
um,

734
00:31:54,490 --> 00:31:58,390
crazy things about him that are hard to 
get over the mean tweets,

735
00:31:58,391 --> 00:31:59,860
the personal tweets,
you know,

736
00:31:59,861 --> 00:32:00,730
all that.
So I don't mind that.

737
00:32:00,731 --> 00:32:02,590
I don't mind the mean tweets,
but,

738
00:32:02,950 --> 00:32:03,783
but I'll,
I'll tell you like three things that he 

739
00:32:05,471 --> 00:32:09,190
has done that have really lifted me,
you know what I mean?

740
00:32:09,191 --> 00:32:10,810
Like I really just felt like,
wow,

741
00:32:10,840 --> 00:32:12,910
I did.
Obviously Gorsuch,

742
00:32:12,911 --> 00:32:16,090
that's the obvious one.
I mean that's a big deal.

743
00:32:16,170 --> 00:32:19,670
And and people who on the right who 
don't like trump keeps saying,

744
00:32:19,690 --> 00:32:22,420
oh you keep bringing up gorsuch.
I'm going to keep bringing it up,

745
00:32:22,421 --> 00:32:24,730
but until I'm gone,
you know that's a big,

746
00:32:24,731 --> 00:32:27,250
big supreme court appointment and he did
a great job.

747
00:32:27,280 --> 00:32:28,113
It's also kind of a funny one to 
diminish regardless of what side you're 

748
00:32:30,231 --> 00:32:31,064
on because guess what,
the supreme courts are a third of the 

749
00:32:33,731 --> 00:32:34,564
government.
That's right.

750
00:32:34,600 --> 00:32:35,433
That's right.
That's one of the brands you left has 

751
00:32:36,401 --> 00:32:39,740
been using them as a super legislature 
and of course it won't do that.

752
00:32:39,741 --> 00:32:42,080
He said opposed to that.
The other one,

753
00:32:42,081 --> 00:32:44,060
and this is a little wonky of me,
but I've been,

754
00:32:44,090 --> 00:32:45,980
I was talking about a way before the 
election,

755
00:32:45,981 --> 00:32:46,814
so I feel I come by,
it naturally is he's been rolling back 

756
00:32:49,011 --> 00:32:51,350
regulations and we were talking about 
this before,

757
00:32:51,351 --> 00:32:52,184
the idea that you need a permit to get 
your to be a hairstylist permit to sell 

758
00:32:55,641 --> 00:32:56,660
lemonade on the street.
You know,

759
00:32:57,590 --> 00:33:00,170
he's been rolling that back and there 
was a deal,

760
00:33:00,171 --> 00:33:02,810
luge that was Obama's kind of,
you know,

761
00:33:02,811 --> 00:33:05,780
uh,
Parthian shot as he was leaving office.

762
00:33:05,780 --> 00:33:09,830
He just left all these regulations in 
place and he's been repealing them.

763
00:33:09,831 --> 00:33:14,831
And I think that that is a huge deal.
The regulatory state is a genuine threat

764
00:33:15,711 --> 00:33:16,970
to our freedoms.
You know,

765
00:33:16,971 --> 00:33:17,804
just the fact that you need,
you need to ask permission of the 

766
00:33:19,431 --> 00:33:21,140
government to do anything,
uh,

767
00:33:21,141 --> 00:33:22,940
is a bad thing.
And that's to me,

768
00:33:23,390 --> 00:33:25,130
I mean,
it really is a really,

769
00:33:25,131 --> 00:33:27,650
is uplifting to me.
And the third thing,

770
00:33:27,651 --> 00:33:29,300
and this is why I wanted to talk about 
trump first,

771
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:33,770
is that he has driven a truck into the 
structure of a corrupt,

772
00:33:34,160 --> 00:33:36,830
biased,
intellectually poisonous media.

773
00:33:37,160 --> 00:33:39,620
And it was rotten.
The structure was rotten.

774
00:33:39,710 --> 00:33:41,660
But he's the one who drove the truck 
into it.

775
00:33:41,661 --> 00:33:46,010
And I don't think anybody else had the 
charisma or the viciousness or,

776
00:33:46,100 --> 00:33:46,933
uh,
or the UN or that understanding that 

777
00:33:49,251 --> 00:33:52,130
comes from being a TV star to do what he
has done.

778
00:33:53,180 --> 00:33:54,230
So I'm with Ya.
Yeah.

779
00:33:54,260 --> 00:33:56,760
Especially on that one.
I liked the regulations also.

780
00:33:56,761 --> 00:33:58,400
I,
this is somewhere where I have shifted a

781
00:33:58,401 --> 00:33:58,971
little bit.
Right.

782
00:33:58,971 --> 00:33:59,804
I get it now the government regulations 
that these nonsensical things and you 

783
00:34:03,191 --> 00:34:04,280
know,
as a small business owner,

784
00:34:04,281 --> 00:34:06,050
I so understand those types of things 
now.

785
00:34:06,350 --> 00:34:07,183
Um,
but that last one to me is the one 

786
00:34:08,661 --> 00:34:11,540
that's really resonating with people.
Even the way you just said it.

787
00:34:11,550 --> 00:34:12,383
And that's the one that is catching fire
with people and that's the one that I 

788
00:34:15,531 --> 00:34:19,610
think really most people just,
it just intuitively they understand.

789
00:34:20,090 --> 00:34:24,170
Do you think he truly truly got it right
from the beginning?

790
00:34:24,171 --> 00:34:26,080
Do you think that really all came from 
him?

791
00:34:26,420 --> 00:34:27,350
Uh,
that's the part,

792
00:34:27,351 --> 00:34:28,550
you know,
I said before the action,

793
00:34:28,610 --> 00:34:30,050
I just don't know what his moral center 
is.

794
00:34:30,051 --> 00:34:34,430
I still don't know what like his real 
sort of the ethos of this man is.

795
00:34:34,580 --> 00:34:37,570
Do you think he really,
really understood that?

796
00:34:37,571 --> 00:34:38,404
Like that was just from being an 
outsider and mocked at the old White 

797
00:34:41,270 --> 00:34:42,103
House press correspondence things and 
being on reality TV in New York media 

798
00:34:45,650 --> 00:34:47,450
and all that.
I think he got it because he's,

799
00:34:47,451 --> 00:34:49,460
then he's one of them,
you know,

800
00:34:49,490 --> 00:34:51,710
he's like,
I mean me too.

801
00:34:51,711 --> 00:34:52,544
I was a reporter,
I was in radio news and all this stuff 

802
00:34:54,650 --> 00:34:57,620
and I would see what was going on and 
how people thought and how,

803
00:34:57,830 --> 00:35:00,470
you know when you're surrounded by 
people who agree with you,

804
00:35:00,471 --> 00:35:02,390
you become biased on,
I think he's just,

805
00:35:02,420 --> 00:35:03,830
he's,
he's got a talent for it.

806
00:35:03,980 --> 00:35:06,470
He's got a talent for,
you know,

807
00:35:07,070 --> 00:35:09,560
I used to talk to Andrew Breitbart and I
would sit there and go like,

808
00:35:09,561 --> 00:35:13,220
I've never heard somebody who 
understands the flow of information that

809
00:35:13,221 --> 00:35:14,054
is going to be here at this moment at 12
o'clock and it's to be here at two 

810
00:35:16,281 --> 00:35:17,410
o'clock and it's going to hear three 
guns.

811
00:35:17,410 --> 00:35:19,070
This is the way it's gonna work trumps 
not like that.

812
00:35:19,071 --> 00:35:23,390
He has a natural genius for 
understanding the flow of information.

813
00:35:23,510 --> 00:35:24,343
Sometimes he will do,
it'll send out a tweet and everybody 

814
00:35:26,391 --> 00:35:28,550
would say,
why did he distract everybody from,

815
00:35:28,710 --> 00:35:29,543
and he did.
He realized that he was losing control 

816
00:35:31,161 --> 00:35:34,250
of the narrative and you seized it back.
And does he do that?

817
00:35:34,520 --> 00:35:37,860
Like sit up in his own,
mount a white and say,

818
00:35:37,980 --> 00:35:39,310
Aha,
now it 10,

819
00:35:39,350 --> 00:35:40,183
12,
15.

820
00:35:40,380 --> 00:35:42,180
I kind of doubt it.
I don't know him,

821
00:35:42,181 --> 00:35:45,900
so I don't know.
But I think he has a natural feeling for

822
00:35:45,901 --> 00:35:48,720
the way this works and he understands,
you know,

823
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:52,590
he'd be a fool not to understand that 
he's under fire unfairly.

824
00:35:52,890 --> 00:35:53,760
Uh,
and,

825
00:35:54,330 --> 00:35:57,970
and I think he knows how to fight back 
and it's a pleasure to watch.

826
00:35:58,100 --> 00:35:58,933
All right,
so trump drives a truck through this 

827
00:35:59,911 --> 00:36:00,450
thing,
right?

828
00:36:00,450 --> 00:36:01,283
I like what has happened there and we're
going to get to that and seeing that in 

829
00:36:03,481 --> 00:36:06,510
a moment,
but let's talk about that 5%.

830
00:36:06,540 --> 00:36:11,540
Do you still fear that 5% or have those 
fears been allayed just because time has

831
00:36:12,421 --> 00:36:14,600
gone on and you haven't seen anything 
that observed,

832
00:36:14,610 --> 00:36:19,230
they have been a lead to almost almost 
entirely everything that I thought about

833
00:36:19,231 --> 00:36:20,064
trump,
it turned out to be true in terms of my 

834
00:36:22,501 --> 00:36:23,334
assessment of his personality,
but none of it turned out to be its 

835
00:36:25,321 --> 00:36:27,830
worst manifestation.
So it,

836
00:36:27,860 --> 00:36:30,420
it really did bother me,
for instance,

837
00:36:30,421 --> 00:36:34,060
that he would use violent language at 
rallies a punch.

838
00:36:34,061 --> 00:36:34,894
This guy,
if you see that Guy Punch him in the 

839
00:36:35,551 --> 00:36:39,600
face and all that stuff and he does have
that side to his personality,

840
00:36:39,810 --> 00:36:43,460
but it didn't manifest itself in,
in actual violence or act.

841
00:36:43,620 --> 00:36:45,870
You know,
he's the opposite of an authoritarian.

842
00:36:45,870 --> 00:36:46,703
If you consider the fact that one of the
most incompetent parts of his imagined 

843
00:36:50,850 --> 00:36:55,850
of his administration is he has been 
unable to fill a lot of the positions in

844
00:36:57,501 --> 00:36:58,231
the,
in the government,

845
00:36:58,231 --> 00:36:59,064
in the permanent government.
He hasn't taken over the permanent 

846
00:37:00,601 --> 00:37:01,434
government,
which is what in the thor and actual 

847
00:37:02,251 --> 00:37:03,084
authoritarian were.
Do you know an actual Hitlerian figure 

848
00:37:05,340 --> 00:37:06,173
would come in and make sure he made all 
the appointments and put his guys in 

849
00:37:07,981 --> 00:37:08,814
there.
He's too lazy to do that because that 

850
00:37:10,111 --> 00:37:11,750
lazy though.
Or is that just a function of heat?

851
00:37:11,790 --> 00:37:12,623
Cause there is some,
some reason to believe he's just having 

852
00:37:14,911 --> 00:37:16,980
trouble getting the right type of 
capital.

853
00:37:16,981 --> 00:37:19,500
I think that he probably is having 
trouble with is he,

854
00:37:19,501 --> 00:37:21,870
you know,
he has this unfortunate habit.

855
00:37:21,871 --> 00:37:25,800
One of his really unfortunate habits of 
wrong footing his own people.

856
00:37:25,950 --> 00:37:28,530
So you'll go out and you'll say,
well,

857
00:37:28,531 --> 00:37:31,740
president trump said this and he'll say,
I didn't say that.

858
00:37:31,950 --> 00:37:34,080
And you get stabbed in the back by your 
own guy.

859
00:37:34,081 --> 00:37:36,330
And I think a lot of people don't want 
to sign on for that.

860
00:37:36,420 --> 00:37:39,270
He's,
he's erratic and he is emotional.

861
00:37:39,271 --> 00:37:41,490
And I think that that's dangerous for 
the,

862
00:37:41,491 --> 00:37:43,140
you know,
the best people that said,

863
00:37:43,230 --> 00:37:44,063
he has appointed a tremendous cabinet.
I mean unbelievable cabinet and the 

864
00:37:47,461 --> 00:37:48,294
cabinet of people who are at odds with 
the agencies that they are appointed to 

865
00:37:51,511 --> 00:37:53,520
lead,
which I think is part of my hatred of,

866
00:37:53,820 --> 00:37:56,610
of uh,
regulation agency and regulation.

867
00:37:56,850 --> 00:37:58,680
So when you see things like,
so something like that,

868
00:37:58,770 --> 00:37:59,603
the Paris climate accords,
I suspect that you are fine with us 

869
00:38:02,011 --> 00:38:03,630
getting thrilled.
I think it's nonsense.

870
00:38:04,530 --> 00:38:09,360
Nonsense in that it was nonbinding.
And so I think that we had to burden the

871
00:38:09,361 --> 00:38:10,350
load or I,
yeah,

872
00:38:10,351 --> 00:38:13,170
I think the Paris accords were only 
going to get us into legal trouble.

873
00:38:13,170 --> 00:38:14,760
There were only there so people could 
sue us.

874
00:38:14,970 --> 00:38:15,803
There was nothing binding about it.
But it would give a lot of legal 

875
00:38:17,791 --> 00:38:18,624
problems to the government.
And I also believe that global warming 

876
00:38:20,851 --> 00:38:22,740
as it's posed,
I,

877
00:38:22,741 --> 00:38:23,574
you know,
I'm not saying that the world isn't 

878
00:38:23,941 --> 00:38:24,774
getting warmer,
I'm just saying that global warming 

879
00:38:26,191 --> 00:38:28,950
isn't hysterical.
Environmental disaster.

880
00:38:29,310 --> 00:38:30,143
Uh,
I,

881
00:38:30,220 --> 00:38:32,930
I'm almost positive it's a nonsense.
Where,

882
00:38:32,950 --> 00:38:35,140
where do you go for information on,
on global warming?

883
00:38:35,141 --> 00:38:35,974
Cause this is one of the ones where I 
find that when I'm talking to 

884
00:38:38,411 --> 00:38:39,244
conservatives and where I know that 
there's so much ground to agree on some 

885
00:38:42,881 --> 00:38:46,090
stuff that I do believe in climate 
change I would do,

886
00:38:46,091 --> 00:38:46,924
I wouldn't eat,
we don't even have to call it global 

887
00:38:47,321 --> 00:38:48,490
warming.
Climate Change.

888
00:38:48,820 --> 00:38:49,653
Um,
well the very fact they changed it to 

889
00:38:51,251 --> 00:38:53,820
climate change from global warming tells
her this argument.

890
00:38:54,700 --> 00:38:55,780
Here's the thing.
I mean,

891
00:38:55,781 --> 00:38:59,200
we're on a rock.
The spiraling into an atomic explosion.

892
00:38:59,290 --> 00:39:02,200
It's not a steady state is not a,
it's not a secure environment.

893
00:39:02,201 --> 00:39:05,020
We're not living.
And we've gone from ice ages to,

894
00:39:05,050 --> 00:39:05,883
you know,
a love of the world being basically 

895
00:39:08,531 --> 00:39:09,281
molten,
you know,

896
00:39:09,281 --> 00:39:10,960
as I mean,
the climate changes.

897
00:39:11,260 --> 00:39:12,093
So we know the climate is changing and 
we know it's gotten more and more over 

898
00:39:14,441 --> 00:39:15,274
the years.
I mean,

899
00:39:15,640 --> 00:39:16,810
you know,
you're going back in time.

900
00:39:16,811 --> 00:39:19,130
There were years when the Thames froze 
and that,

901
00:39:19,140 --> 00:39:19,973
you know,
and people skated on the Thames and so 

902
00:39:21,281 --> 00:39:23,560
like we know that there's,
there's changes.

903
00:39:24,820 --> 00:39:29,820
There is no way to a know how much of 
this is human endeavor and,

904
00:39:31,500 --> 00:39:34,120
and be to know how much,
how this goes into the future.

905
00:39:34,270 --> 00:39:35,103
When people say science,
there is no science for predicting the 

906
00:39:37,511 --> 00:39:38,344
future.
There is no science for predicting the 

907
00:39:39,731 --> 00:39:40,210
future.

908
00:39:40,210 --> 00:39:42,520
When people are telling you what's going
to happen in the future,

909
00:39:42,670 --> 00:39:45,700
they are what's coming out of their 
mouth is nothing.

910
00:39:45,910 --> 00:39:46,743
Okay.
When people say this is what's going to 

911
00:39:48,041 --> 00:39:48,874
happen 10 years down the line,
I have arguments like this about 

912
00:39:50,411 --> 00:39:51,970
politics too.
And somebody says,

913
00:39:51,971 --> 00:39:54,680
well if we do this then in four years 
and go like ass,

914
00:39:54,690 --> 00:39:57,430
stop sovereign right there I go,
I'll give you until Thursday.

915
00:39:57,580 --> 00:39:59,400
And then you're right.
You know,

916
00:39:59,410 --> 00:40:01,150
I mean,
well I love that because every time they

917
00:40:01,151 --> 00:40:01,984
show anything that worked well the CBO 
said that in 10 years this is going to 

918
00:40:04,331 --> 00:40:05,620
cost 20 million lives.
They like,

919
00:40:05,621 --> 00:40:07,780
has that ever happened?
They're always doing this.

920
00:40:08,020 --> 00:40:08,853
And by the way,
you're the same people who got 

921
00:40:09,581 --> 00:40:13,830
everything wrong before the election and
now you suddenly can prognosticate.

922
00:40:13,840 --> 00:40:15,580
Perfect.
And when you hear the phrase,

923
00:40:15,640 --> 00:40:16,473
if present trends continue,
it's like everything after that is 

924
00:40:18,191 --> 00:40:19,660
nonsense because that never happens 
either.

925
00:40:19,660 --> 00:40:20,650
You're right.
So all right,

926
00:40:20,651 --> 00:40:22,870
so without,
without getting too far into the climate

927
00:40:22,871 --> 00:40:23,704
change thing,
do you think there's some role for 

928
00:40:24,731 --> 00:40:25,564
government to play with dealing with 
other nations when it comes to climate 

929
00:40:30,170 --> 00:40:32,500
and that I can't think of anything.
I mean,

930
00:40:32,501 --> 00:40:33,580
except like,
you know,

931
00:40:33,640 --> 00:40:34,473
I,
I do believe in preserving our 

932
00:40:35,591 --> 00:40:37,150
environment and taking care of things.
Yeah.

933
00:40:37,230 --> 00:40:38,063
You know,
this is the thing is the left always 

934
00:40:38,921 --> 00:40:39,754
takes these rational issues where 
there's a true good to be gained and 

935
00:40:43,571 --> 00:40:46,420
they turned them into hysteria.
So give us all your power.

936
00:40:46,660 --> 00:40:47,380
I mean,
look,

937
00:40:47,380 --> 00:40:48,213
I'm a religious guy.
If a guy comes on TV and says Jesus is 

938
00:40:50,501 --> 00:40:52,210
coming tomorrow unless you send me a 
check,

939
00:40:52,390 --> 00:40:53,530
I get suspicious.
Right.

940
00:40:53,700 --> 00:40:54,533
But so when these guys say to me,
if you don't give the government all 

941
00:40:57,131 --> 00:41:00,550
power and essentially fulfill every 
socialist need,

942
00:41:01,090 --> 00:41:03,400
the world is going to be destroyed in a 
hail of fire.

943
00:41:03,460 --> 00:41:04,660
I feel the same way.
It's like yeah,

944
00:41:04,661 --> 00:41:08,750
I'll turn on something else and see if 
there's an old Yogi Berra rerun on her,

945
00:41:09,340 --> 00:41:11,820
which there usually you go up into the 
really high channel.

946
00:41:11,821 --> 00:41:13,610
It's like around one 30 or so.
Uh,

947
00:41:13,750 --> 00:41:14,980
okay.
Let's talk about the media.

948
00:41:15,010 --> 00:41:16,420
Okay.
Cause cause you can talk about,

949
00:41:16,540 --> 00:41:18,830
we can talk ourselves into a trump 
style.

950
00:41:18,840 --> 00:41:19,673
Yes.
Fidget spinner and not going to get us 

951
00:41:20,711 --> 00:41:22,390
anywhere.
So uh,

952
00:41:22,630 --> 00:41:24,370
the media,
he drove this truck through it.

953
00:41:24,610 --> 00:41:27,640
I do think it's great.
I think it's helped voices like yours,

954
00:41:27,641 --> 00:41:28,474
like what we're doing here.
Like many other people who are not 

955
00:41:31,751 --> 00:41:34,870
promising all the answers but at least 
promising discussions and,

956
00:41:34,871 --> 00:41:37,340
and some,
some lines of thought that maybe weren't

957
00:41:37,341 --> 00:41:38,174
getting out there in the mainstream.
Do you think that there is a risk in 

958
00:41:40,401 --> 00:41:41,234
that too?
That we are just going to filter 

959
00:41:43,341 --> 00:41:44,174
ourselves into oblivion to the point 
where instead of having three news 

960
00:41:48,501 --> 00:41:49,334
channels,
we're now going to have a good Gillian 

961
00:41:50,361 --> 00:41:53,240
of them and we're all going to hate each
other for a zillion new and reasons that

962
00:41:53,241 --> 00:41:54,110
we didn't even realize that.

963
00:41:54,140 --> 00:41:56,450
Definitely there's a definite moral 
hazard here.

964
00:41:56,451 --> 00:41:57,171
I mean a free,
you know,

965
00:41:57,171 --> 00:41:58,004
as,
as,

966
00:41:58,100 --> 00:41:58,933
as,
as these liars and our press keeps 

967
00:42:00,351 --> 00:42:03,260
saying a free press is important to a 
free society.

968
00:42:03,261 --> 00:42:04,700
And you do want,
I mean,

969
00:42:04,701 --> 00:42:07,310
another thing that's working well under 
trump is that everybody,

970
00:42:07,420 --> 00:42:10,370
that the pressers attacking the people 
in power instead of what they did during

971
00:42:10,371 --> 00:42:13,970
the Obama administration where they kept
their hands over their eyes and said,

972
00:42:13,971 --> 00:42:15,530
oh look,
he's scandal free.

973
00:42:16,190 --> 00:42:17,023
I would argue there's a little bit of an
overcorrection happened and 

974
00:42:18,741 --> 00:42:21,530
overcorrection no question about it.
But that's because they're so corrupt.

975
00:42:21,531 --> 00:42:22,364
I mean,
that's why.

976
00:42:22,790 --> 00:42:24,520
So I do believe in,
uh,

977
00:42:24,580 --> 00:42:25,540
a,
uh,

978
00:42:26,030 --> 00:42:26,863
I can't remember the word,
but a press that basically stands up to 

979
00:42:29,361 --> 00:42:30,950
power.
I do believe in a free press.

980
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:32,113
We don't have a free press.
We have a press that has been corrupted 

981
00:42:34,191 --> 00:42:35,330
beyond its purposes.

982
00:42:35,720 --> 00:42:37,820
And that doesn't mean they're no good 
reporters.

983
00:42:38,510 --> 00:42:39,343
That means that a good reporter on the 
New York Times is basically doing the 

984
00:42:42,561 --> 00:42:46,690
wrong thing because he's giving credence
and uh,

985
00:42:46,940 --> 00:42:51,290
he's given credence and credibility to a
sophomore,

986
00:42:51,291 --> 00:42:55,100
Eric Left Wing College magazine,
and with his,

987
00:42:55,101 --> 00:42:56,870
can you give an example of that?
Because that's the type of thing.

988
00:42:56,871 --> 00:42:57,704
So I attack CNN all the time.
I've seen some bad stuff lately out of 

989
00:43:00,441 --> 00:43:03,830
the New York Times where the headline 
leads you one way and then when you read

990
00:43:03,831 --> 00:43:05,450
it,
it really isn't what it said.

991
00:43:05,660 --> 00:43:07,580
They've been doing a lot of corrections 
lately,

992
00:43:07,581 --> 00:43:09,960
which usually no one reads the 
correction.

993
00:43:09,961 --> 00:43:11,630
So you never see any of that.
But when I,

994
00:43:11,690 --> 00:43:14,060
when I do attack the New York Times,
people would give me more shit.

995
00:43:14,061 --> 00:43:15,830
Like CNN.
It's like everyone's in on the joke now,

996
00:43:16,980 --> 00:43:18,500
but New York Times it's a little bit 
different.

997
00:43:18,501 --> 00:43:20,430
So when you describe it as a,
as a sophomore,

998
00:43:21,450 --> 00:43:21,980
oh,
there,

999
00:43:21,980 --> 00:43:26,180
I mean if you read their op Ed page,
which I now call knucklehead row,

1000
00:43:26,181 --> 00:43:27,440
you know,
if you read their op ed page,

1001
00:43:27,780 --> 00:43:32,080
really is like a bunch of eight year old
girls in a room where a mouse has gotten

1002
00:43:32,090 --> 00:43:32,360
loose.

1003
00:43:32,360 --> 00:43:33,830
And so they're all screaming and 
yelling,

1004
00:43:33,831 --> 00:43:35,500
everybody running around in hysterics.
And,

1005
00:43:35,510 --> 00:43:37,580
and that's really unfair to eight year 
old girls.

1006
00:43:38,540 --> 00:43:39,800
And if you read,
I mean,

1007
00:43:39,801 --> 00:43:40,634
just yesterday they ran a story of 
Donald Trump jr met with a Russian 

1008
00:43:43,281 --> 00:43:44,810
lawyer and all this.
Who Cares?

1009
00:43:45,110 --> 00:43:46,010
I mean,
who cares?

1010
00:43:46,011 --> 00:43:46,844
Donald Trump jr met with a Russian 
lawyer to get info because he thought 

1011
00:43:49,791 --> 00:43:52,220
she had information on the opposition 
and everybody,

1012
00:43:52,221 --> 00:43:54,860
you know,
faints and who cares?

1013
00:43:54,950 --> 00:43:57,920
I saw celebrities,
well known people think this is it.

1014
00:43:57,921 --> 00:43:59,810
This is the collusion we've been looking
for.

1015
00:43:59,840 --> 00:44:01,100
It's a panic.
It's called story.

1016
00:44:01,101 --> 00:44:03,140
It's called opposition research.
Everyone does this.

1017
00:44:03,141 --> 00:44:05,960
Do you think Hillary didn't meet with 
people to see if they had information on

1018
00:44:05,961 --> 00:44:10,040
trump and only in an organization where 
no one is sitting next to you who says,

1019
00:44:10,370 --> 00:44:12,050
dude,
that's not a story.

1020
00:44:12,051 --> 00:44:13,580
That's a 30 page,
30 story.

1021
00:44:14,180 --> 00:44:18,050
Only in a place where everybody thinks 
we've found the smoking gun.

1022
00:44:18,290 --> 00:44:19,820
Can you make a fool of yourself like 
that?

1023
00:44:20,150 --> 00:44:20,871
You know?
In other words,

1024
00:44:20,871 --> 00:44:23,510
you want somebody to say to you,
you know,

1025
00:44:23,720 --> 00:44:25,820
like,
I know you're a conservative,

1026
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:26,833
but there is some thing to not letting 
people starve to death in the streets 

1027
00:44:29,751 --> 00:44:30,490
and go,
oh yeah,

1028
00:44:30,490 --> 00:44:33,540
from out of it.
You okay then the opposite is true,

1029
00:44:33,541 --> 00:44:33,961
you know?
Yeah.

1030
00:44:33,961 --> 00:44:37,450
I know you were a left winger,
but everybody does oppo research and you

1031
00:44:37,460 --> 00:44:38,293
know,
the fact that she was from Russia and 

1032
00:44:38,780 --> 00:44:40,260
makes it doesn't mean a thing.
You know?

1033
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:41,940
And by the way,
as far as I know,

1034
00:44:41,941 --> 00:44:44,390
he didn't buy anything from you or take 
anything from her.

1035
00:44:44,730 --> 00:44:47,250
It was a ruse to get them to talk about 
this ruling.

1036
00:44:47,251 --> 00:44:48,084
You know,
that limits the way they can use banks 

1037
00:44:49,561 --> 00:44:50,394
and all this stuff.

1038
00:44:50,410 --> 00:44:51,243
I,
you know,

1039
00:44:51,690 --> 00:44:54,930
we'd been listening to this stupid story
for six months,

1040
00:44:54,931 --> 00:44:56,970
this Russian story.
It is not a story.

1041
00:44:57,090 --> 00:44:58,320
I mean,
it's just not,

1042
00:44:58,321 --> 00:44:59,154
and even,
even the Russian meddling with the 

1043
00:45:01,081 --> 00:45:03,000
election,
which I believe happened,

1044
00:45:03,300 --> 00:45:06,420
is kind of like finding a spy.
You know,

1045
00:45:06,421 --> 00:45:07,710
we go,
oh my goodness,

1046
00:45:07,711 --> 00:45:10,270
there's a spy who would ever spy on a 
call,

1047
00:45:10,380 --> 00:45:11,790
you know,
uh,

1048
00:45:11,820 --> 00:45:13,710
you know,
can we bring our spies back for a couple

1049
00:45:13,711 --> 00:45:14,030
of,
you know,

1050
00:45:14,030 --> 00:45:15,120
that that's what this is.
Like,

1051
00:45:15,121 --> 00:45:17,070
we do it to them and all this,
and they do it to us.

1052
00:45:17,490 --> 00:45:21,230
So the New York Times has become,
it's dishonest and it,

1053
00:45:21,270 --> 00:45:24,660
they use good reporters in good 
reporting to tell a dishonest story.

1054
00:45:24,960 --> 00:45:25,793
And the fact that they think that they 
even can conceive of the idea that 

1055
00:45:29,011 --> 00:45:32,550
they're not a leftist rag shows you how 
far gone they are.

1056
00:45:32,551 --> 00:45:33,570
I mean,
that they cannot,

1057
00:45:33,780 --> 00:45:34,690
you know,
Eh,

1058
00:45:34,750 --> 00:45:36,600
Eh,
take it any day,

1059
00:45:36,780 --> 00:45:37,613
pick up the Wall Street Journal and pick
up the New York Times and the Wall 

1060
00:45:40,590 --> 00:45:40,590
Street Journal.

1061
00:45:40,590 --> 00:45:42,270
You're talking to an adult,
the New York Times,

1062
00:45:42,271 --> 00:45:43,550
you're talking to a child.
Well,

1063
00:45:43,900 --> 00:45:46,100
it's interesting that you made a point 
of saying the op Ed page,

1064
00:45:46,101 --> 00:45:46,934
it's too,
because obviously you expect opinion 

1065
00:45:48,810 --> 00:45:50,690
that's separate than the editorial side,
but he,

1066
00:45:50,710 --> 00:45:51,543
but their app aid page,
the reaction to some of the things that 

1067
00:45:53,401 --> 00:45:54,234
they're doing has gotten insane.
So they brought Bret Stevens from the 

1068
00:45:56,550 --> 00:45:57,383
Wall Street Journal.
He writes that one piece basically just 

1069
00:45:58,411 --> 00:45:59,244
about skepticism.
It didn't even really say he doesn't 

1070
00:46:00,691 --> 00:46:01,680
believe in climate change.
Right.

1071
00:46:01,710 --> 00:46:03,240
I think you may have even said the 
opposite.

1072
00:46:03,480 --> 00:46:04,313
But then there were immediately people 
demanding he be fired and all of this 

1073
00:46:08,101 --> 00:46:11,040
craziness just for having an alternate 
opinion on their op Ed page.

1074
00:46:11,220 --> 00:46:12,570
But the one that I thought was more 
interesting,

1075
00:46:12,571 --> 00:46:14,160
do you see the one a couple of weeks 
ago,

1076
00:46:14,400 --> 00:46:15,810
uh,
about uh,

1077
00:46:15,840 --> 00:46:19,770
Bret Weinstein from evergreen state and 
it was all about campus free speech.

1078
00:46:19,770 --> 00:46:20,603
But basically the thrust of it at the 
end was we as liberal as better there 

1079
00:46:23,560 --> 00:46:25,620
are caring about this because it's 
coming for us.

1080
00:46:25,650 --> 00:46:26,670
Right.
And I thought,

1081
00:46:26,671 --> 00:46:27,504
what an odd admission you,
you are now admitting that you didn't 

1082
00:46:30,961 --> 00:46:31,794
care about free speech because it was 
coming about coming against the other 

1083
00:46:33,860 --> 00:46:34,693
[inaudible].
Right now it's finally turning on a guy 

1084
00:46:35,791 --> 00:46:37,200
who's left,
left,

1085
00:46:37,201 --> 00:46:38,280
left,
super progressive.

1086
00:46:38,281 --> 00:46:41,490
So now we better start caring.
Like that was strange.

1087
00:46:41,491 --> 00:46:42,930
Admitted it was a nice,
it was refreshing.

1088
00:46:42,940 --> 00:46:43,773
I suppose it is,
but I mean I think the New York Times 

1089
00:46:45,091 --> 00:46:48,100
was just gone so far down this hole that
uh,

1090
00:46:48,360 --> 00:46:50,370
an article like that stands out.
You know,

1091
00:46:50,371 --> 00:46:52,200
when you read an article like that and 
the Times you go like,

1092
00:46:52,201 --> 00:46:54,330
wow,
even in the New York Times there now for

1093
00:46:54,331 --> 00:46:55,500
free speech,
you know,

1094
00:46:55,770 --> 00:46:56,760
that's,
that's not good.

1095
00:46:56,761 --> 00:46:58,170
You know,
like in the New York Times should be for

1096
00:46:58,171 --> 00:46:59,700
free speech every day for everyone.

1097
00:46:59,700 --> 00:47:00,533
Every day.
The New York Times should have 

1098
00:47:01,620 --> 00:47:02,453
conservatives on,
on the desks where the news decisions 

1099
00:47:05,851 --> 00:47:07,470
are being made.
You know,

1100
00:47:07,540 --> 00:47:09,060
the,
the Wall Street Journal is,

1101
00:47:09,190 --> 00:47:13,050
is anti trump and its news pages 
sometimes unfairly,

1102
00:47:13,051 --> 00:47:14,880
I think,
but not crazily.

1103
00:47:14,910 --> 00:47:15,743
You know,
they have people obviously correcting 

1104
00:47:16,951 --> 00:47:19,040
their opinions.
You know,

1105
00:47:19,110 --> 00:47:23,220
that comes a level that comes a time 
when the level of corruption gets so bad

1106
00:47:23,700 --> 00:47:24,533
that audacity becomes a kind of a brag.
So you see this in governments all the 

1107
00:47:28,231 --> 00:47:29,470
time.
You see it in Illinois,

1108
00:47:29,471 --> 00:47:32,710
places like Chicago and things like this
where remember the,

1109
00:47:32,730 --> 00:47:34,150
the uh,
uh,

1110
00:47:34,180 --> 00:47:36,710
boss tweed and the little tin box and 
all this stuff,

1111
00:47:37,270 --> 00:47:41,260
put the money in a little tin box.
This corruption is,

1112
00:47:41,261 --> 00:47:42,094
this is,
this comes from a sense that we are so 

1113
00:47:43,571 --> 00:47:45,730
corrupt that no one can touch us.
Okay?

1114
00:47:46,150 --> 00:47:46,983
When you put George Stephanopoulos,
a Clinton hack at the top of your news 

1115
00:47:51,071 --> 00:47:52,510
team,
he is your news guy.

1116
00:47:52,870 --> 00:47:55,060
That's a sign that you have become 
corrupt.

1117
00:47:55,260 --> 00:47:57,460
It's not that he's at ABC news that's 
ABC,

1118
00:47:57,461 --> 00:47:59,590
has not,
not that he's not a nice man or whatever

1119
00:47:59,591 --> 00:48:01,240
he is.
He's a guy who once said to Hillary,

1120
00:48:01,390 --> 00:48:02,223
I love you hillary.
He can have a role in your news 

1121
00:48:04,331 --> 00:48:05,164
department,
but he should not be running in your 

1122
00:48:06,041 --> 00:48:08,090
news department,
the guy at CBS.

1123
00:48:08,091 --> 00:48:08,924
So who just looks like Ted Baxter to me.
You remember from the buyer isn't Scott 

1124
00:48:14,140 --> 00:48:14,973
Pelley who may,
who made decisions so bias during the 

1125
00:48:18,281 --> 00:48:19,114
Obama administration that his own 
reporters didn't want their stories 

1126
00:48:21,701 --> 00:48:24,670
going on his air because they didn't 
want to do what I was talking about with

1127
00:48:24,671 --> 00:48:25,504
serve a biased report.
This corruption has becomes so manifest 

1128
00:48:30,311 --> 00:48:35,311
and so absurd that to see it taken down 
is a beautiful thing.

1129
00:48:35,980 --> 00:48:36,813
But you're right,
we need to replace it with something of 

1130
00:48:38,711 --> 00:48:39,070
value.

1131
00:48:39,070 --> 00:48:40,510
We need to replace it with something 
that works.

1132
00:48:40,570 --> 00:48:42,820
So is that why they're hitting back so 
hard?

1133
00:48:42,821 --> 00:48:46,750
So the CNN thing that happened last week
with this threat to docs,

1134
00:48:47,050 --> 00:48:49,570
this person who did an perfectly legal 
thing,

1135
00:48:49,571 --> 00:48:52,030
it is legal to make means,
by the way,

1136
00:48:52,090 --> 00:48:53,800
he didn't make it for trump.
However,

1137
00:48:53,801 --> 00:48:54,634
it got to trump,
and it sounds like it was actually a 

1138
00:48:55,721 --> 00:48:56,760
slightly altered version,
right?

1139
00:48:56,920 --> 00:48:57,753
We don't know how it is,
but there are millions of people making 

1140
00:48:59,201 --> 00:49:01,540
means on the Internet as we sit here.
Right.

1141
00:49:01,541 --> 00:49:02,374
The second,
it wasn't just that they were 

1142
00:49:04,031 --> 00:49:06,100
threatening to dox this guy for doing 
something illegal.

1143
00:49:06,370 --> 00:49:08,320
It was the line after that where they 
said,

1144
00:49:08,321 --> 00:49:11,550
he's agreed not to do this offensive,
blah,

1145
00:49:11,551 --> 00:49:11,801
blah,
blah.

1146
00:49:11,801 --> 00:49:12,634
Again,
as if they're the church or his parents 

1147
00:49:14,381 --> 00:49:15,340
or something.
So it,

1148
00:49:15,341 --> 00:49:17,320
to me that was,
that was the scarier thing,

1149
00:49:17,321 --> 00:49:19,690
not the threat of the docs,
which of course is wrong,

1150
00:49:20,080 --> 00:49:24,820
but the threat that they were tacitly 
saying or implicitly saying to everybody

1151
00:49:24,821 --> 00:49:25,930
else,
we're,

1152
00:49:26,080 --> 00:49:28,390
we're watching you two and we're going 
to come for all of them.

1153
00:49:28,420 --> 00:49:29,253
Well,
you know,

1154
00:49:29,530 --> 00:49:31,630
the Internet turned on them in a 
beautiful fashion,

1155
00:49:31,631 --> 00:49:32,200
right?
And,

1156
00:49:32,200 --> 00:49:33,033
but it was only the,
the followup and the completion of the 

1157
00:49:36,611 --> 00:49:37,444
logic that went after joe the plumber.
And of course the right mishandled that 

1158
00:49:40,601 --> 00:49:41,434
by elevating joe the plumber to some 
kind of commentator because he'd been 

1159
00:49:43,751 --> 00:49:45,010
attack.
But remember Joe,

1160
00:49:45,011 --> 00:49:48,490
the plumber went out and asked the 
question of a political candidate and he

1161
00:49:48,491 --> 00:49:50,350
went after the Chi West.
The question,

1162
00:49:50,840 --> 00:49:51,880
I mean,
this is what the,

1163
00:49:51,881 --> 00:49:56,080
how corrupt they've become.
And they are thuggish and this is all of

1164
00:49:56,081 --> 00:49:56,411
them.
This is,

1165
00:49:56,411 --> 00:49:57,880
I mean,
I'm talking about the networks.

1166
00:49:58,000 --> 00:49:58,833
I'm talking about the times,
I'm talking about Wapo and I'm talking 

1167
00:50:00,311 --> 00:50:01,144
about CNN,
which is in some ways the least of them 

1168
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:06,670
because it's just a small operation that
would vanish like that.

1169
00:50:06,671 --> 00:50:08,680
If people cut their cable cords,
you know?

1170
00:50:08,681 --> 00:50:09,070
Right,
right.

1171
00:50:09,070 --> 00:50:10,120
They say,
what's that thing?

1172
00:50:10,120 --> 00:50:12,310
They say that if they would get cnn at 
airports,

1173
00:50:12,311 --> 00:50:14,290
it would lose.
Like they would lose all of his,

1174
00:50:14,291 --> 00:50:16,460
all of his viewers do.
You know,

1175
00:50:17,020 --> 00:50:19,360
it's all of these guys and and they 
hate,

1176
00:50:19,361 --> 00:50:22,870
it hasn't even occurred to one of them.
Not one of them has said,

1177
00:50:22,960 --> 00:50:23,351
well,
you know,

1178
00:50:23,351 --> 00:50:27,010
trump is being a jerk and trump is not,
it's not fair what he does.

1179
00:50:27,020 --> 00:50:27,853
It's really wrong when he attacks our 
reporter in terms of her face or 

1180
00:50:30,381 --> 00:50:31,041
whatever,
you know,

1181
00:50:31,041 --> 00:50:33,260
like,
but he has a point,

1182
00:50:33,470 --> 00:50:35,090
you know,
we need to reform our industry.

1183
00:50:35,091 --> 00:50:39,090
There's a reason that the people believe
Donald Trump more than they believe us.

1184
00:50:39,091 --> 00:50:41,060
There's a reason that people hate us so 
much.

1185
00:50:41,120 --> 00:50:43,250
So it really is that they've just been 
drunk on power.

1186
00:50:43,300 --> 00:50:44,133
Yeah.
These last,

1187
00:50:44,240 --> 00:50:45,440
whatever it is,
30 years,

1188
00:50:45,441 --> 00:50:46,274
they'd been drunk on power for so long 
and now they finally have someone 

1189
00:50:49,011 --> 00:50:49,910
throwing it in their face.

1190
00:50:49,910 --> 00:50:50,743
And now the people,
the actual people that are rising up 

1191
00:50:52,911 --> 00:50:55,460
against them to that.
And I saw,

1192
00:50:55,580 --> 00:50:58,160
uh,
you saw probably Chris Cuomo,

1193
00:50:58,460 --> 00:51:00,950
who of course his brother is the mayor 
or the governor,

1194
00:51:00,960 --> 00:51:01,793
he's a yard one.
He said his father was the governor of 

1195
00:51:03,261 --> 00:51:04,400
New York.
He's an idiot.

1196
00:51:04,401 --> 00:51:08,270
He's like Fredo from the,
he really,

1197
00:51:08,271 --> 00:51:08,940
I mean,
I,

1198
00:51:08,940 --> 00:51:11,120
every time you see the guys,
just another,

1199
00:51:11,121 --> 00:51:11,954
just embarrassed,
but he tweeted something about these 

1200
00:51:14,540 --> 00:51:15,373
hateful means and should we release the 
information because the guys tweeted 

1201
00:51:19,251 --> 00:51:21,590
some other races and stuff and all that.
And then he ended up deleting it.

1202
00:51:21,830 --> 00:51:23,240
But I,
I retweeted him and I said,

1203
00:51:23,241 --> 00:51:24,074
would you say that a meme or a Gif is 
worse than what then Linda Sarsour 

1204
00:51:30,081 --> 00:51:31,670
calling for a jihad?
Now,

1205
00:51:31,671 --> 00:51:33,180
we talked about it briefly before we 
started,

1206
00:51:33,200 --> 00:51:35,720
but regardless of whether she meant her 
own personal jihad,

1207
00:51:35,721 --> 00:51:36,554
but she's talking about the white 
supremacists and Islamophobia in the 

1208
00:51:39,410 --> 00:51:39,560
White House.

1209
00:51:39,560 --> 00:51:41,570
And everyone knows if you're using that 
word,

1210
00:51:41,571 --> 00:51:44,180
you're trying to gin up a certain 
something.

1211
00:51:44,570 --> 00:51:48,090
And My tweak got way more retweets and 
everything then than any of his due.

1212
00:51:48,110 --> 00:51:50,000
He has a million followers and almost no
interaction,

1213
00:51:50,001 --> 00:51:51,890
which also tells you a little something.
Um,

1214
00:51:52,310 --> 00:51:53,143
but I bring this up because it's like,
of course he doesn't respond because 

1215
00:51:55,611 --> 00:51:58,460
they think they're beholden to nobody to
where it's like we're,

1216
00:51:58,461 --> 00:52:00,590
but we actually are beholden to our 
audience.

1217
00:52:00,620 --> 00:52:01,453
You know,
when I was a newspaper man was a 

1218
00:52:02,541 --> 00:52:03,374
newspaper man in a small town with a 
very powerful and somewhat corrupt 

1219
00:52:06,141 --> 00:52:07,910
sheriff.
So it was like out of a movie,

1220
00:52:07,911 --> 00:52:08,571
you know,
and I would do,

1221
00:52:08,571 --> 00:52:10,760
I would batch it again.
And I remember saying to one,

1222
00:52:10,850 --> 00:52:13,940
I had some sources in the department and
I remember saying to one of them,

1223
00:52:14,120 --> 00:52:14,953
look,
we work for,

1224
00:52:15,010 --> 00:52:16,220
we both worked for the people.

1225
00:52:16,430 --> 00:52:17,263
And he turned around and he said,
I work with are the people you work for 

1226
00:52:18,531 --> 00:52:19,880
a corporation?
And I thought,

1227
00:52:20,060 --> 00:52:20,893
my God,
he's right.

1228
00:52:21,860 --> 00:52:23,630
He said,
that's true.

1229
00:52:23,900 --> 00:52:25,280
That's true.
They don't understand that.

1230
00:52:25,281 --> 00:52:27,110
They're just mouthpieces for big 
corporations,

1231
00:52:27,111 --> 00:52:30,380
which love big government because big 
government hurts the little guy,

1232
00:52:30,560 --> 00:52:32,000
you know,
that's all they're doing.

1233
00:52:32,001 --> 00:52:35,420
They're just standing up for these 
powerful corporations in the name of all

1234
00:52:35,421 --> 00:52:36,700
the leftist,
you know,

1235
00:52:36,800 --> 00:52:39,020
uh,
by words and all this stuff.

1236
00:52:39,470 --> 00:52:40,303
You know,
they really have lost any real sense of 

1237
00:52:43,191 --> 00:52:44,870
themselves.
And it's just,

1238
00:52:45,280 --> 00:52:47,960
it's,
it's pitiful to watch in some ways,

1239
00:52:48,200 --> 00:52:50,390
but it is good to see it getting 
exposed.

1240
00:52:50,391 --> 00:52:52,430
And what I would like to see on the 
right,

1241
00:52:52,880 --> 00:52:56,300
I feel on the right,
we have a lot of really good people like

1242
00:52:56,301 --> 00:52:59,360
you and me and Ben and all these people 
expressing opinions.

1243
00:52:59,570 --> 00:53:00,403
But we,
I don't consider myself part of the 

1244
00:53:01,041 --> 00:53:03,860
right kind of moving into libertarian.

1245
00:53:04,190 --> 00:53:05,090
I would say,
you know,

1246
00:53:05,091 --> 00:53:06,590
I'm,
I'm still a liberal,

1247
00:53:06,800 --> 00:53:09,260
which is a fine line between that and a 
libertarian.

1248
00:53:09,261 --> 00:53:10,094
But yes,
I,

1249
00:53:10,370 --> 00:53:11,203
I,
I hate to even pause you there to say 

1250
00:53:12,591 --> 00:53:13,424
that,
but I know a certain amount of people 

1251
00:53:13,791 --> 00:53:15,770
start screaming.
But I considered my,

1252
00:53:15,771 --> 00:53:17,930
I'm more than happy to talk to all you 
guys,

1253
00:53:17,980 --> 00:53:20,410
but I say it all the time that I'm a 
conservative because I'm alone.

1254
00:53:21,220 --> 00:53:22,880
I'll just give it varies on that.
Okay.

1255
00:53:22,910 --> 00:53:23,870
Yeah.
And I,

1256
00:53:24,080 --> 00:53:28,920
I think that I would like to see us 
start to gather information and,

1257
00:53:29,110 --> 00:53:29,943
and that's expensive and you need people
to back you when you needed to somehow 

1258
00:53:33,121 --> 00:53:33,954
make it profitable.
But we need to start sending people to 

1259
00:53:36,181 --> 00:53:38,610
the hotspots because for me to get the 
facts,

1260
00:53:38,790 --> 00:53:39,623
I have to go to the New York Times and 
the Wall Street Journal and CNN and all 

1261
00:53:42,121 --> 00:53:47,121
these places cause they hire reporters 
and it's opinions are great and insights

1262
00:53:48,241 --> 00:53:51,360
are great and there is now because the 
press is so corrupt,

1263
00:53:51,510 --> 00:53:55,470
there is an actual need for people like 
us to say,

1264
00:53:55,710 --> 00:53:58,950
they're telling you the facts mean this,
but the facts actually might mean this,

1265
00:53:58,951 --> 00:53:59,784
you know,
that is an actual profession now as a 

1266
00:54:01,291 --> 00:54:03,390
real profession that needs to be done.

1267
00:54:03,750 --> 00:54:04,583
But I would like to see the right go 
after have people in Iraq have people 

1268
00:54:09,301 --> 00:54:10,081
in,
uh,

1269
00:54:10,081 --> 00:54:11,460
you know,
in the hotspots of the world,

1270
00:54:11,461 --> 00:54:12,294
have people in Washington DC,
the best news program on television as 

1271
00:54:16,291 --> 00:54:20,490
Brett bears special report because they 
gather news and because they're fair,

1272
00:54:20,580 --> 00:54:21,630
even though he's,
you know,

1273
00:54:21,631 --> 00:54:24,570
even though they tilt to the right,
they're very fair about what they cover.

1274
00:54:25,290 --> 00:54:26,123
Are you shocked by the breadth of it?
Just sort of the amount of activists 

1275
00:54:30,270 --> 00:54:33,690
masquerading as journalists because 
that's what I think they are truly,

1276
00:54:33,930 --> 00:54:35,040
these people are not,
I mean,

1277
00:54:35,041 --> 00:54:37,230
I've seen just some of the recent hit 
pieces on me.

1278
00:54:37,260 --> 00:54:38,130
Yeah.
And it's like,

1279
00:54:38,131 --> 00:54:38,964
no matter how much I plead my case or 
defend myself or show them evidence to 

1280
00:54:41,791 --> 00:54:42,630
the contrary of what,
uh,

1281
00:54:42,810 --> 00:54:43,643
you know,
some mother Jones calling me and 

1282
00:54:44,881 --> 00:54:46,350
extremist to the right of Breitbart.

1283
00:54:46,610 --> 00:54:48,660
Wow.
Real doozy.

1284
00:54:48,960 --> 00:54:50,850
And it's like,
you know,

1285
00:54:50,870 --> 00:54:52,500
they,
they don't correct anything.

1286
00:54:52,501 --> 00:54:53,334
They don't care.
They know their job is safe and it's 

1287
00:54:54,481 --> 00:54:57,150
like forgetting all that you are not a 
journalist.

1288
00:54:57,520 --> 00:54:58,353
That's what I,
I tweeted the guys something to that 

1289
00:54:59,341 --> 00:54:59,671
effect.
Like,

1290
00:54:59,671 --> 00:55:01,200
I just want you to admit,
you're not a journalist,

1291
00:55:01,400 --> 00:55:02,100
right?
Right.

1292
00:55:02,100 --> 00:55:04,050
What you want,
even though I probably had a decent case

1293
00:55:04,051 --> 00:55:04,651
for liable,
right?

1294
00:55:04,651 --> 00:55:07,170
What you want,
but can you admit what you're doing?

1295
00:55:07,260 --> 00:55:12,000
And it's like that sort of,
that lack of self awareness.

1296
00:55:12,210 --> 00:55:12,991
You know,
I,

1297
00:55:12,991 --> 00:55:16,860
I've been,
I have now been saying this to the right

1298
00:55:16,980 --> 00:55:20,910
for 10,
15 years about our loss of the culture.

1299
00:55:21,240 --> 00:55:22,073
And that's what this is.
This is the result of our loss of the 

1300
00:55:24,271 --> 00:55:27,810
universities,
of our loss of TV stations.

1301
00:55:27,811 --> 00:55:28,560
You know,
uh,

1302
00:55:28,560 --> 00:55:31,950
women's magazines.
Every woman's magazine is left wing.

1303
00:55:31,980 --> 00:55:34,440
Every comedian on television,
every late night comedian,

1304
00:55:34,500 --> 00:55:37,470
every single one is a left winger,
not one,

1305
00:55:37,560 --> 00:55:38,393
not one woman.

1306
00:55:38,410 --> 00:55:39,243
And when,
and when one of them made a joke was 

1307
00:55:41,191 --> 00:55:43,980
nice to Donald Trump,
he was basically pilloried,

1308
00:55:43,981 --> 00:55:45,540
you know,
he had to take Jimmy Fallon,

1309
00:55:45,570 --> 00:55:46,620
Jimmy Fallon.
That was the one.

1310
00:55:46,621 --> 00:55:47,101
Yeah.
I mean,

1311
00:55:47,101 --> 00:55:48,820
it's hard to tell the difference because
they're all the same,

1312
00:55:48,821 --> 00:55:49,261
you know,
they're all,

1313
00:55:49,261 --> 00:55:51,720
exactly,
how do we,

1314
00:55:51,780 --> 00:55:54,180
how did we let that happen?
Then why don't we respond?

1315
00:55:54,390 --> 00:55:55,223
And I always do.
I always say to conservatives that 

1316
00:55:57,720 --> 00:55:58,553
telling them about the culture is like 
trying to explain to my wife when she 

1317
00:56:00,931 --> 00:56:02,910
buys something on sale,
it's still costs money.

1318
00:56:03,750 --> 00:56:05,430
Had you always looks at me and he goes 
and says,

1319
00:56:05,431 --> 00:56:06,264
you know,
you're a cute guy and I like you but I 

1320
00:56:07,441 --> 00:56:09,600
don't know what you're talking about.
And that's the way conservatives look at

1321
00:56:09,601 --> 00:56:10,160
me.
You know,

1322
00:56:10,160 --> 00:56:10,993
like how did we get to the point where 
we have people talking like a 100 year 

1323
00:56:16,081 --> 00:56:18,690
old men go on,
I don't go to the movies anymore.

1324
00:56:18,690 --> 00:56:19,523
I just turn on,
turn our clouddam Doris stays good 

1325
00:56:21,211 --> 00:56:22,020
enough,
you know?

1326
00:56:22,020 --> 00:56:23,980
I mean,
that's insane.

1327
00:56:23,981 --> 00:56:24,814
And how do we get to the point where we 
start making stuff that educates people 

1328
00:56:29,800 --> 00:56:34,090
not to be right wingers but simply to 
open their minds a little bit.

1329
00:56:34,210 --> 00:56:36,070
So I don't know what your feelings are 
on Milo,

1330
00:56:36,071 --> 00:56:36,904
but I suspect that after hearing you say
that you must at least love much of the 

1331
00:56:40,631 --> 00:56:41,464
movement behind him because he isn't he 
that isn't that thing that you're now 

1332
00:56:45,101 --> 00:56:47,440
saying we got,
we were winning the culture war back.

1333
00:56:47,441 --> 00:56:48,274
I mean,
he talked about that all the time right 

1334
00:56:49,481 --> 00:56:50,314
here.
You know,

1335
00:56:50,470 --> 00:56:52,770
that is such a great question.
It really is.

1336
00:56:52,800 --> 00:56:55,420
It's a great question because Milo gives
me fits.

1337
00:56:55,600 --> 00:56:57,520
Uh,
I've only spoken to Milo once.

1338
00:56:57,521 --> 00:56:59,950
We had a long conversation about video 
games.

1339
00:56:59,951 --> 00:57:02,770
He was when he was on Gamergate and,
um,

1340
00:57:03,250 --> 00:57:04,480
and I liked the men,
you know what I mean?

1341
00:57:04,480 --> 00:57:05,313
I got along with him.
He has done some stuff that's so 

1342
00:57:07,481 --> 00:57:09,580
vicious,
partly to my friend Ben Shapiro,

1343
00:57:09,581 --> 00:57:11,940
which I resent because he's my friend,
um,

1344
00:57:12,310 --> 00:57:15,400
an antisemitic and,
and he's given,

1345
00:57:15,610 --> 00:57:19,650
given shelter to Antisemites,
which I always feel the minute,

1346
00:57:19,660 --> 00:57:21,190
dice minute,
I see antisemitism.

1347
00:57:21,210 --> 00:57:22,870
It is the canary in the coal mine.
You know,

1348
00:57:22,871 --> 00:57:25,600
that's where like evil dwells basically.
I usually go for the,

1349
00:57:25,710 --> 00:57:27,320
for it,
go for the Jews first and like,

1350
00:57:28,120 --> 00:57:33,120
so there's stuff that he's done that I 
just think it's great and I wish that he

1351
00:57:34,750 --> 00:57:35,600
would,
uh,

1352
00:57:35,680 --> 00:57:36,513
you know,
find himself in a somewhat better place 

1353
00:57:39,310 --> 00:57:41,830
because there is such a thing.
Even though I believe everyone should be

1354
00:57:41,831 --> 00:57:43,650
allowed to speak.
There are some things that are,

1355
00:57:43,840 --> 00:57:46,740
that when spoken or reprehensible,
you know what I mean?

1356
00:57:46,750 --> 00:57:47,501
So,
well,

1357
00:57:47,501 --> 00:57:49,150
there's,
there's consequences for your speech.

1358
00:57:49,151 --> 00:57:49,841
That's right.
You know,

1359
00:57:49,841 --> 00:57:52,330
and when I hear him,
uh,

1360
00:57:52,660 --> 00:57:55,510
you know,
I don't know the June remarks and the,

1361
00:57:55,511 --> 00:57:57,100
and the kind of,
um,

1362
00:57:58,220 --> 00:57:59,800
the,
the kind of hateful,

1363
00:58:00,910 --> 00:58:04,630
allowing hatefulness to be cute,
allowing it to be ironic saying,

1364
00:58:04,660 --> 00:58:05,770
you know,
I've heard him say,

1365
00:58:05,771 --> 00:58:07,890
for instance,
I've heard him say when,

1366
00:58:07,910 --> 00:58:11,650
when our generation is antisemitic,
they're just being ironical.

1367
00:58:11,660 --> 00:58:12,550
I think like,
yeah,

1368
00:58:12,551 --> 00:58:14,170
that's a snake that's going to bite 
back.

1369
00:58:14,171 --> 00:58:14,830
You know,
I don't,

1370
00:58:14,830 --> 00:58:16,700
I don't really buy into that.
And,

1371
00:58:16,710 --> 00:58:17,543
and so I like what he's doing.
I don't always like the way that he's 

1372
00:58:20,921 --> 00:58:23,440
doing it or what he's doing it in 
service to.

1373
00:58:23,441 --> 00:58:27,610
But certainly when he had what was 
called the dangerous faggot tour,

1374
00:58:27,650 --> 00:58:28,810
yeah,
I laughed out loud.

1375
00:58:28,811 --> 00:58:30,580
I thought I wanted more of those guys.
I mean,

1376
00:58:30,581 --> 00:58:31,301
that was bright,
bright.

1377
00:58:31,301 --> 00:58:33,370
Bart and I used to have this 
conversation all the time.

1378
00:58:33,520 --> 00:58:35,710
You know,
when I first met Breitbart,

1379
00:58:35,711 --> 00:58:39,220
he kind of enlisted me into the La,
right as he did.

1380
00:58:39,221 --> 00:58:40,390
Almost all of us.
Uh,

1381
00:58:40,570 --> 00:58:41,830
you know,
I said to him,

1382
00:58:41,831 --> 00:58:42,664
I want to tell you right upfront that 
I'm not going in for this gay stuff 

1383
00:58:45,731 --> 00:58:47,830
because of this anti gay stuff cause I 
think we're going to lose.

1384
00:58:47,860 --> 00:58:48,341
I said,
hey,

1385
00:58:48,341 --> 00:58:49,174
we're going to lose,
which has no shame but we're going to 

1386
00:58:50,471 --> 00:58:52,300
lose and be wrong.
And that's a shame.

1387
00:58:52,301 --> 00:58:54,400
That's really shameful.
Breitbart said to me,

1388
00:58:54,520 --> 00:58:58,000
what I want is more patriotic gay porn.
I said,

1389
00:58:58,540 --> 00:58:59,373
sign me up.

1390
00:59:01,270 --> 00:59:02,103
Two straight guys demanding more 
patriotic that how much of the country 

1391
00:59:05,950 --> 00:59:08,380
we're going to watch it.
But you know,

1392
00:59:08,381 --> 00:59:09,910
and,
and so I think that,

1393
00:59:10,190 --> 00:59:10,841
uh,
you know,

1394
00:59:10,841 --> 00:59:13,600
I have this conversation with people 
about Milo all the time.

1395
00:59:13,870 --> 00:59:18,870
I see a good that he is doing.
I see dangers in the way he's doing it.

1396
00:59:19,601 --> 00:59:24,050
And I think you can be too about too 
much because there is moral universe and

1397
00:59:24,060 --> 00:59:26,600
you do not want to,
you didn't want to blow yourself through

1398
00:59:26,601 --> 00:59:28,180
it.
Do you think that's kind of the fast and

1399
00:59:28,190 --> 00:59:30,530
bargain that you have to play?
You're getting what you want,

1400
00:59:30,560 --> 00:59:33,050
what you've wanted here,
and you as a guy that's been through the

1401
00:59:33,051 --> 00:59:35,090
Hollywood machine too,
so you're,

1402
00:59:35,091 --> 00:59:37,340
you're getting the culture wins that 
really,

1403
00:59:37,490 --> 00:59:38,810
if he had,
let's say he had done,

1404
00:59:38,950 --> 00:59:39,783
you know,
been a little more careful with his 

1405
00:59:41,451 --> 00:59:42,284
language or not done some of the 
unnecessary over the top stuff or 

1406
00:59:44,901 --> 00:59:46,730
whatever that it might have.

1407
00:59:46,920 --> 00:59:50,360
Uh,
it might've shaved some of the good part

1408
00:59:50,361 --> 00:59:51,320
that you want.
Yeah.

1409
00:59:51,321 --> 00:59:52,154
Maybe,
maybe just wouldn't have broke through 

1410
00:59:52,801 --> 00:59:55,250
with his name.
That's kind of what the trump,

1411
00:59:55,280 --> 00:59:56,350
the trump,
ian bargain.

1412
00:59:56,440 --> 00:59:57,273
I was only a guy as uncaring about the 
niceties would have driven his truck 

1413
01:00:04,460 --> 01:00:07,010
into the media the way he did.
And I think that,

1414
01:00:07,280 --> 01:00:09,080
does it come with moral hazards?
Yes.

1415
01:00:09,081 --> 01:00:09,914
To people have to speak up about those 
moral hazards and take the flack from 

1416
01:00:12,351 --> 01:00:13,550
the right when they say,
you know,

1417
01:00:13,551 --> 01:00:15,380
oh you're a cock and you're all these 
things.

1418
01:00:15,530 --> 01:00:16,363
Yes we have to take that flag but it has
to be done because I think we had 

1419
01:00:20,211 --> 01:00:21,044
reached a tipping point.
I hate to use a cliched phrase like 

1420
01:00:23,781 --> 01:00:24,614
that,
but I think we had reached a tipping 

1421
01:00:25,191 --> 01:00:29,840
point where we were sounding very much 
like a communist country.

1422
01:00:29,841 --> 01:00:30,674
Like there was things that you could say
that made you persona non grata that 

1423
01:00:33,891 --> 01:00:34,700
there were opinions.

1424
01:00:34,700 --> 01:00:36,530
You can have that,
you know,

1425
01:00:36,560 --> 01:00:40,250
the trap door,
like the James Bond villain drop through

1426
01:00:40,251 --> 01:00:42,860
the trap door.
I think we were in a dangerous point.

1427
01:00:42,861 --> 01:00:46,730
And if we end political correctness is a
smothering toxic,

1428
01:00:46,790 --> 01:00:47,623
uh,
evil device for making the lines seemed 

1429
01:00:51,861 --> 01:00:52,694
like a virtue.
And if Donald Trump destroys political 

1430
01:00:55,371 --> 01:00:57,560
correctness,
he will have done a great thing.

1431
01:00:57,770 --> 01:00:58,670
I mean,
a great thing.

1432
01:00:59,060 --> 01:00:59,893
And that,
that has moral hazards come along with 

1433
01:01:02,721 --> 01:01:03,950
that.
I think we shouldn't forget it.

1434
01:01:04,110 --> 01:01:04,943
And you know,
a good example of this was when they 

1435
01:01:05,601 --> 01:01:08,690
shut down Shakespeare on the park the 
other day.

1436
01:01:08,720 --> 01:01:12,080
Now Shakespeare that was reprehensible 
to assassinate the president or onstage.

1437
01:01:12,140 --> 01:01:13,100
I really think,
you know,

1438
01:01:13,101 --> 01:01:14,390
as a,
as a Shakespeare Fan,

1439
01:01:14,630 --> 01:01:16,700
I think that it was a,
an awful,

1440
01:01:16,701 --> 01:01:17,534
awful thing to do.
But they would have done the same thing 

1441
01:01:19,161 --> 01:01:20,070
if it was Obama,
right?

1442
01:01:20,300 --> 01:01:21,133
Yeah.
But to shut them down and to have my 

1443
01:01:24,831 --> 01:01:26,390
friends,
you know,

1444
01:01:26,391 --> 01:01:28,190
writing that this was a good thing.

1445
01:01:28,850 --> 01:01:29,683
You know that that's a mistake.
I completely agree because now what 

1446
01:01:32,901 --> 01:01:35,060
you're saying,
it's okay to fight to say,

1447
01:01:35,061 --> 01:01:36,740
well we've got to be as tough as the 
left,

1448
01:01:36,950 --> 01:01:37,783
but to say we've got to be as tough as 
the left for things that the left would 

1449
01:01:39,951 --> 01:01:41,570
approve of like shutting down free 
speech.

1450
01:01:41,810 --> 01:01:44,750
That doesn't make any sense to me.
And that's why he both,

1451
01:01:44,810 --> 01:01:46,370
and that's why again,
these sides,

1452
01:01:46,371 --> 01:01:50,900
the sides are just becoming meaningless 
and nonsense science.

1453
01:01:50,901 --> 01:01:54,550
I think that that's a really good 
observation because I do think that I,

1454
01:01:54,551 --> 01:01:55,384
and I,
I,

1455
01:01:55,410 --> 01:01:56,243
this is part of the problem I have with 
the right right now is I keep saying to 

1456
01:01:58,881 --> 01:01:59,540
them,
you know,

1457
01:01:59,540 --> 01:02:00,373
you're right there.
They're disturbed because the 

1458
01:02:01,821 --> 01:02:02,654
conservative movement has essentially 
collapsed when trump swept all those 

1459
01:02:05,421 --> 01:02:08,000
guys off the stage,
the way he did and the primaries,

1460
01:02:08,300 --> 01:02:10,880
the conservative movement was done for.

1461
01:02:10,880 --> 01:02:13,380
And my response to that is fix it.
You know,

1462
01:02:13,430 --> 01:02:15,200
put it back together differently.
You know,

1463
01:02:15,230 --> 01:02:16,700
get,
it's a new world,

1464
01:02:17,150 --> 01:02:17,983
make a new conservative conservatism.
You don't have to get rid of your 

1465
01:02:20,401 --> 01:02:21,234
principles.
You don't have to get rid of your big 

1466
01:02:22,321 --> 01:02:24,180
principles,
but you might have to get rid of some of

1467
01:02:24,181 --> 01:02:26,160
the ways those principles express 
themselves in the world.

1468
01:02:26,190 --> 01:02:27,300
Yeah.
So is that just,

1469
01:02:27,330 --> 01:02:28,710
that's just real politic,
right?

1470
01:02:28,711 --> 01:02:29,610
I mean,
it seems to be here,

1471
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:32,430
you're just viewing the world as it is,
not as you want it to be.

1472
01:02:32,431 --> 01:02:34,230
So if you,
if you had a guy like,

1473
01:02:34,231 --> 01:02:35,064
uh,
like bill kristol where it's like he 

1474
01:02:36,631 --> 01:02:40,350
wants that conservative thing to exist 
again,

1475
01:02:41,280 --> 01:02:43,620
I don't think you can make that happen 
or you certainly can't.

1476
01:02:43,650 --> 01:02:44,483
It's going to go through several other 
iterations before it was ever to get 

1477
01:02:46,801 --> 01:02:48,090
back to something like that.

1478
01:02:48,120 --> 01:02:48,481
Yeah,
no,

1479
01:02:48,481 --> 01:02:51,720
I'm interested in guys like Henry Olsen 
who are basically saying,

1480
01:02:51,750 --> 01:02:56,610
pointing out that Reagan was kind of an 
Fdr Democrat more than anything else and

1481
01:02:56,611 --> 01:02:59,820
he invented the kind of modern 
conservatism I,

1482
01:02:59,830 --> 01:03:01,320
I'm interested in guys who say,
look,

1483
01:03:01,321 --> 01:03:04,800
this is the field of play and this is 
where we want to get.

1484
01:03:05,340 --> 01:03:06,000
See,
this is,

1485
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:08,820
this is the thing that I know that I 
notice a lot of commentators don't.

1486
01:03:08,821 --> 01:03:10,650
I know where I want to get.
I want to get to more freedom.

1487
01:03:10,980 --> 01:03:14,330
I have more freedom now six months after
the election of Donald Trump,

1488
01:03:14,331 --> 01:03:15,164
seven months after the election of 
Donald Trump than I did eight months 

1489
01:03:17,131 --> 01:03:18,300
ago.
No question.

1490
01:03:18,301 --> 01:03:19,134
In my mind,
the fact that the EPA can't now rule my 

1491
01:03:21,571 --> 01:03:22,404
sink a waterway and declare that they 
can now tell me whether I can shave or 

1492
01:03:26,011 --> 01:03:26,670
not.
You know,

1493
01:03:26,670 --> 01:03:28,230
I think that that makes me more free.

1494
01:03:28,230 --> 01:03:29,550
I think judge [inaudible] that being 
said,

1495
01:03:29,551 --> 01:03:31,200
trump may not be great on eminent 
domain,

1496
01:03:31,201 --> 01:03:32,034
right?
Because he might want this wall to cut 

1497
01:03:33,151 --> 01:03:33,984
through things.
You know,

1498
01:03:34,020 --> 01:03:35,340
who knows where that will the walls at 
now.

1499
01:03:35,341 --> 01:03:36,174
But I assure you he would have no 
problem using eminent domain to make a 

1500
01:03:39,061 --> 01:03:40,810
cut through.
Yeah,

1501
01:03:40,860 --> 01:03:41,301
no,
there,

1502
01:03:41,301 --> 01:03:45,630
there are all these dangers involved and
so I just want to see as the ball moving

1503
01:03:45,631 --> 01:03:48,360
in the freedom direction all the time.
And right now it is.

1504
01:03:48,570 --> 01:03:51,690
And you know,
I definitely see moral hazards.

1505
01:03:51,691 --> 01:03:53,370
I definitely look at it.
Got a Milo.

1506
01:03:53,371 --> 01:03:54,204
I mean he's such a good example cause I 
look at him and they're things that he 

1507
01:03:57,151 --> 01:04:01,290
does that I make me laugh out loud and I
just think it's wonderful.

1508
01:04:01,291 --> 01:04:04,350
He's here and then suddenly he'll say 
something and I'll think,

1509
01:04:04,351 --> 01:04:05,184
except we don't want it.
You don't want to give credence to 

1510
01:04:08,521 --> 01:04:10,110
hatred and evil.

1511
01:04:10,140 --> 01:04:11,520
You know,
I mean it evil,

1512
01:04:11,550 --> 01:04:14,730
evil is bigger than irony and evil will 
eat irony,

1513
01:04:14,731 --> 01:04:15,564
you know?
And so you want to be careful about 

1514
01:04:16,501 --> 01:04:17,334
that.
I don't know.

1515
01:04:17,400 --> 01:04:19,050
I feel that that could have been the 
ending,

1516
01:04:19,051 --> 01:04:21,450
but I'm gonna I'm gonna ask you one 
other thing,

1517
01:04:21,750 --> 01:04:22,583
which is do you fear perhaps that these 
forces which have grown so fat and it 

1518
01:04:27,921 --> 01:04:30,210
were so drunk on their own power and all
that,

1519
01:04:30,211 --> 01:04:31,044
now that it's starting to crumble,
do you fear that they will hit back on 

1520
01:04:34,801 --> 01:04:39,060
people like you and people like me and 
whoever in a way that we made don't,

1521
01:04:39,240 --> 01:04:41,340
we may not understand yet.
In other words,

1522
01:04:41,341 --> 01:04:41,780
that,
that,

1523
01:04:41,780 --> 01:04:45,480
that thing that they did with the Han 
asshole solo and the Gif,

1524
01:04:45,750 --> 01:04:46,583
where are the meme was uh,
a warning shot only of the way that 

1525
01:04:50,911 --> 01:04:53,370
they're going to try to treat the people
who go against them.

1526
01:04:53,600 --> 01:04:54,433
I think we've seen it with these leaks 
from the intelligence community about 

1527
01:04:57,151 --> 01:04:57,984
Donald Trump did this and they turned 
out some of those leaks turned out not 

1528
01:05:00,391 --> 01:05:03,210
to be true,
but the press was perfectly happy to say

1529
01:05:03,300 --> 01:05:05,250
sources within the intelligence 
community,

1530
01:05:05,251 --> 01:05:06,540
former officials,
and you think,

1531
01:05:06,541 --> 01:05:07,680
well,
what does a former official,

1532
01:05:07,681 --> 01:05:08,491
no,
it didn't matter.

1533
01:05:08,491 --> 01:05:09,324
They were putting on a front page.
That was the front page on the New York 

1534
01:05:10,801 --> 01:05:12,480
Times,
The Washington Post.

1535
01:05:12,660 --> 01:05:14,760
They were,
that was the deep state striking back.

1536
01:05:14,761 --> 01:05:17,410
There's no question about it.
They're going to continue to fight.

1537
01:05:17,530 --> 01:05:20,410
This is a genuine battle.
This is a genuine battle for,

1538
01:05:20,610 --> 01:05:21,310
uh,
you know,

1539
01:05:21,310 --> 01:05:23,230
I hate to say it,
but it's a battle for the future.

1540
01:05:23,231 --> 01:05:25,240
I mean,
I think that this global world,

1541
01:05:25,510 --> 01:05:26,343
which has many good things in it,
I think free trade and global 

1542
01:05:29,141 --> 01:05:29,974
communication and all of this also 
allowed a small group of people to make 

1543
01:05:34,541 --> 01:05:38,680
decisions on unelected people to make 
decisions for,

1544
01:05:38,710 --> 01:05:42,550
for people who had no way to redress 
their grievances.

1545
01:05:42,730 --> 01:05:45,190
And I think that that can't be,
you know,

1546
01:05:45,191 --> 01:05:48,600
if we're going to become a global world,
then I want America to take it over that

1547
01:05:48,601 --> 01:05:50,530
basically,
I'm an imperialist in that regard.

1548
01:05:50,531 --> 01:05:51,850
If we,
if the world's gonna be global,

1549
01:05:51,880 --> 01:05:52,713
fine,
but everybody's living under the 

1550
01:05:53,411 --> 01:05:54,380
constitution,
you know,

1551
01:05:54,440 --> 01:05:56,260
that's the way it's going to be.
If not,

1552
01:05:56,320 --> 01:05:59,020
if everybody's not living under the 
constitution in Saudi Arabia,

1553
01:05:59,021 --> 01:06:02,140
doesn't want to live under the 
constitution than I want Saudi Arabia to

1554
01:06:02,141 --> 01:06:02,974
stay in Saudi Arabia and I want Saudi 
Arabians to stay in Saudi Arabia unless 

1555
01:06:06,941 --> 01:06:09,100
they want to come over here to live 
under the constitution.

1556
01:06:09,280 --> 01:06:11,040
So those are the choices.
You know what I mean?

1557
01:06:11,050 --> 01:06:11,883
That's an interesting way to frame it.
There's a global world run by the 

1558
01:06:14,321 --> 01:06:16,630
Constitution or America first.
Well,

1559
01:06:16,631 --> 01:06:21,180
Andrew,
a anonymous source on Capitol Hill.

1560
01:06:21,630 --> 01:06:24,120
He's telling me right now that this was 
an excellent interview.

1561
01:06:24,150 --> 01:06:25,680
Oh,
it's always a pleasure to talk to you.

1562
01:06:25,681 --> 01:06:28,230
I hope we can continue the conversation.
You know,

1563
01:06:28,231 --> 01:06:29,610
I get my,
my anonymous sources.

1564
01:06:29,611 --> 01:06:32,400
I've got to the US from Gloria Borger.
She's always quoting this anonymous,

1565
01:06:32,670 --> 01:06:35,400
like you talking to the janitor,
like source on capital.

1566
01:06:35,401 --> 01:06:38,060
It's anybody.
That's what I want people to understand.

1567
01:06:38,070 --> 01:06:39,330
It's anybody.
It's all made up.

1568
01:06:39,360 --> 01:06:42,450
It's been a pleasure as always.
And for more on Andrew,

1569
01:06:42,451 --> 01:06:44,910
check him out on the Andrew Klavan show.
Brilliant name,

1570
01:06:44,911 --> 01:06:46,220
by the way,
where you know,

1571
01:06:46,230 --> 01:06:48,220
it was amazing.
We worked for ages on it.

1572
01:06:48,740 --> 01:06:51,300
The Andrew Klavan show.
It's right here on the youtube.
