1
00:00:05,070 --> 00:00:05,903
We're continuing our partnership with 
learn liberty this week and joining me 

2
00:00:08,191 --> 00:00:12,150
today as a senior fellow at the Mercatus
Center at George Mason University,

3
00:00:12,151 --> 00:00:15,330
as well as a professor of economics at 
George Mason.

4
00:00:15,570 --> 00:00:17,070
Don Boudreaux,
welcome to the Rubin report.

5
00:00:17,130 --> 00:00:19,440
Happy to be here.
I am glad you are here.

6
00:00:19,441 --> 00:00:22,200
I saw you speak about a year ago in 
Dallas.

7
00:00:22,201 --> 00:00:24,780
I want to get the exact title of the 
speech right.

8
00:00:25,130 --> 00:00:26,160
Uh,
it was called,

9
00:00:26,190 --> 00:00:29,880
can we bring sound economic thinking to 
Washington?

10
00:00:30,220 --> 00:00:33,600
That's a tough task.
That was a year ago and uh,

11
00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:34,493
I don't think there's much sound 
economic thinking or sound thinking and 

12
00:00:36,961 --> 00:00:38,870
Washington,
forget economics for a second.

13
00:00:38,910 --> 00:00:41,340
These things don't seem to go together 
these days.

14
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:43,590
Uh,
Washington seems to repel something.

15
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:47,510
It attracts unsound thinking.
Yeah.

16
00:00:47,650 --> 00:00:48,990
Well,
you think it was always that way,

17
00:00:48,991 --> 00:00:51,210
or are we in unique times?
What?

18
00:00:51,211 --> 00:00:53,070
We're definitely a unique talent and 
unique time.

19
00:00:53,110 --> 00:00:53,943
So I was born in 1958,
so I came of age right when Ronald 

20
00:00:58,770 --> 00:00:59,603
Reagan,
right at the end of the Carter 

21
00:01:00,691 --> 00:01:03,400
administration,
when even Carter's pushing for direct,

22
00:01:03,690 --> 00:01:04,523
at least accepting deregulation taxes 
were being cut airline to being 

23
00:01:06,841 --> 00:01:09,330
deregulated surface transportation is 
being deregulated.

24
00:01:09,330 --> 00:01:14,040
Reagan gets elected in 1980.
Milton Friedman has this popular show on

25
00:01:14,041 --> 00:01:19,041
pbs called free to choose a Thomas.
I learned about Thomas Soul.

26
00:01:19,950 --> 00:01:20,830
Everything seems great.
And there was,

27
00:01:20,870 --> 00:01:23,300
this world is fine.
And uh,

28
00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:24,293
so in my life in my life,
there was a period in the past when the 

29
00:01:29,070 --> 00:01:34,070
thinking was more sound quibble with it,
but compared to today it was,

30
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:38,940
it was outstanding because it's 
definitely,

31
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,770
it's definitely declined.
Yeah,

32
00:01:41,010 --> 00:01:41,843
it's hard to imagine even that around 
the time of Jimmy Carter that 

33
00:01:44,521 --> 00:01:45,830
deregulation,
I mean that,

34
00:01:45,860 --> 00:01:48,480
that Democrats could have had anything 
to do with that.

35
00:01:48,481 --> 00:01:53,430
And yet the Ted Kennedy was a major 
force behind airline deregulation.

36
00:01:53,790 --> 00:01:55,380
So it was,
it was something,

37
00:01:55,381 --> 00:01:57,690
I'm not sure what it was exactly.
It was something in the air,

38
00:01:58,150 --> 00:02:00,060
uh,
starting in the late seventies.

39
00:02:00,300 --> 00:02:00,870
And so,
you know,

40
00:02:00,870 --> 00:02:02,610
I was a young man then I just took it 
for granted,

41
00:02:03,330 --> 00:02:03,901
this is fine,
you know,

42
00:02:03,901 --> 00:02:08,640
we were winning and then it culminates 
in 1989 with the collapse of the,

43
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,490
of the,
of the Iron Curtain in 1991,

44
00:02:11,491 --> 00:02:12,660
the collapse of the Soviet Union.

45
00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:17,660
And then here we are 2018 and a lot of 
nonsense is back on the front burner.

46
00:02:18,570 --> 00:02:19,403
Nonsense is back.
So let's jump back though to the 

47
00:02:21,091 --> 00:02:24,030
seventies for a second because I watched
an interview with you this morning.

48
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:27,910
Something happened to you I believe in 
1977 that,

49
00:02:27,950 --> 00:02:28,783
that woke you up.
And I think it sort of is a nice entry 

50
00:02:31,231 --> 00:02:32,830
into everything else that,
you know,

51
00:02:32,900 --> 00:02:33,541
I know what you said.
Yeah.

52
00:02:33,541 --> 00:02:36,690
I said is most important to what 
happened to you in 1977?

53
00:02:36,691 --> 00:02:37,950
You can come up with a couple of 
options.

54
00:02:37,990 --> 00:02:40,110
They don't know.
The date was,

55
00:02:40,130 --> 00:02:42,120
was,
was January 24th,

56
00:02:42,121 --> 00:02:44,670
1977.
I remember it was a um,

57
00:02:44,990 --> 00:02:46,950
I,
I was in college.

58
00:02:46,951 --> 00:02:47,900
I went to police.
My mother,

59
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:51,690
my plan was to drink beer,
chase girls.

60
00:02:51,830 --> 00:02:54,260
I did a lot of the former,
I wasn't successful with the ladder,

61
00:02:54,750 --> 00:02:55,583
but I was then I was going to drop out 
of college and work at the shipyard 

62
00:02:57,510 --> 00:02:58,343
where my parents worked,
so I needed a class to fit my schedule 

63
00:03:01,771 --> 00:03:02,650
and needed the Monday,
Wednesday,

64
00:03:02,651 --> 00:03:03,260
Friday class.

65
00:03:03,260 --> 00:03:05,440
So take this class called economics,
didn't know what it was,

66
00:03:05,530 --> 00:03:06,363
took it and uh,
I had a great teacher and so she drew 

67
00:03:10,361 --> 00:03:11,980
supply and demand curves on the board 
and she said,

68
00:03:11,981 --> 00:03:12,814
look what happens when the government 
prevents the price of something from 

69
00:03:14,861 --> 00:03:17,770
rising to its market level,
it creates a shortage.

70
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:18,753
She says,
you remember the gasoline shortages of 

71
00:03:19,901 --> 00:03:21,300
1973.
So yeah,

72
00:03:21,690 --> 00:03:22,523
I was in those and I just thought the 
beauty of this economic explanation for 

73
00:03:28,690 --> 00:03:31,420
the gasoline shortage was so 
spectacular.

74
00:03:31,421 --> 00:03:32,770
I wanted to learn more about the 
subject.

75
00:03:32,771 --> 00:03:35,740
And so in very short order,
I just fell in love with economics.

76
00:03:35,741 --> 00:03:37,390
I'm still in love with it to this day.
Yeah.

77
00:03:37,450 --> 00:03:40,990
So tell me what happened after that.
So now you have your spar and what,

78
00:03:41,010 --> 00:03:41,843
what sort of,
what academic procedures did you have 

79
00:03:43,941 --> 00:03:45,670
that got you to where you are?
Was very lucky.

80
00:03:45,700 --> 00:03:46,533
Again,
she was a really good teacher and it 

81
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:50,710
wasn't a famous economist at all.
She was a very good teacher.

82
00:03:50,711 --> 00:03:52,390
She took a great interest in her 
students.

83
00:03:52,660 --> 00:03:53,493
She taught economics as if it was 
something relevant to the real world 

84
00:03:55,361 --> 00:03:58,550
rather than just a mathematical puzzle.
Uh,

85
00:03:58,630 --> 00:04:02,410
and there was another guy at my I went 
to puts called Nicholls State University

86
00:04:02,411 --> 00:04:05,020
and Tibideau Louisiana and it says it's 
a very small school,

87
00:04:05,710 --> 00:04:10,600
but I had another professor there who 
was into Milton Friedman into high Eq,

88
00:04:11,170 --> 00:04:14,470
into Ludwig von mises into James 
Buchanan,

89
00:04:14,471 --> 00:04:16,270
who later became my colleague at George 
Mason.

90
00:04:16,271 --> 00:04:18,490
So I would go to his office,
his name is bill field,

91
00:04:19,060 --> 00:04:19,893
and he would give me these books.
And so I remember just really just 

92
00:04:21,730 --> 00:04:24,430
tearing through these books and it just 
made so much sense to me.

93
00:04:24,431 --> 00:04:28,120
I realized in reading these books that 
all my life,

94
00:04:28,150 --> 00:04:30,070
I didn't give much thought to politics.

95
00:04:30,100 --> 00:04:32,920
Not much conscious thought,
but all my life,

96
00:04:33,190 --> 00:04:34,023
uh,
I think somewhere deep inside of me was 

97
00:04:35,801 --> 00:04:36,634
a classical liberal or libertarian,
someone who believed that is basically 

98
00:04:40,361 --> 00:04:43,060
impolite to button to other people's 
business.

99
00:04:43,430 --> 00:04:44,270
Uh,
and,

100
00:04:44,350 --> 00:04:45,180
and,
and,

101
00:04:45,180 --> 00:04:45,700
and,
and,

102
00:04:45,700 --> 00:04:47,050
and not only impolite,
I mean it's,

103
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:49,750
it's downright,
it's downright offensive to do so.

104
00:04:49,790 --> 00:04:51,560
Yeah.
You just said to him,

105
00:04:51,561 --> 00:04:53,680
my buzz phrases,
so classical,

106
00:04:53,681 --> 00:04:55,450
liberal and Libertarian.
Now,

107
00:04:55,451 --> 00:04:58,540
one of the questions I get most because 
I define,

108
00:04:58,541 --> 00:05:00,550
I say that I am a classical liberal if I
need,

109
00:05:00,790 --> 00:05:03,340
if I need a label on it,
that's what I am.

110
00:05:03,341 --> 00:05:06,340
And people will always say to me because
I talk about many of the things that you

111
00:05:06,341 --> 00:05:08,200
teach about,
about free markets and all that stuff,

112
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:11,770
and I believe that freedom is the best 
way for humans to flourish.

113
00:05:11,950 --> 00:05:12,641
People say,
Dave,

114
00:05:12,641 --> 00:05:16,180
you're really a libertarian.
You're just holding onto this definition

115
00:05:16,181 --> 00:05:18,340
of liberalism from 18,
whatever.

116
00:05:18,850 --> 00:05:21,550
Do you see a meaningful.
How would you define each one and do you

117
00:05:21,551 --> 00:05:23,800
see a meaningful distinction?
I don't see much of a distinction.

118
00:05:23,801 --> 00:05:25,360
Depends on who you talk to.
Some people see,

119
00:05:25,420 --> 00:05:28,020
see distinctions.
I think what they both have in common,

120
00:05:28,050 --> 00:05:28,883
maybe distinctions that the margin 
libertarians maybe tend to be a little 

121
00:05:31,331 --> 00:05:33,130
bit more radical,
uh,

122
00:05:33,550 --> 00:05:34,120
uh,
but uh,

123
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:35,290
uh,
a,

124
00:05:35,950 --> 00:05:36,783
what distinguishes classical liberals 
and Libertarians as broadly from almost 

125
00:05:40,931 --> 00:05:42,900
any other political group,
a,

126
00:05:42,910 --> 00:05:44,800
is the consistent,
uh,

127
00:05:44,930 --> 00:05:45,763
uh,
believe that any exercise of power by 

128
00:05:48,491 --> 00:05:51,910
the state must meet a huge burden of 
proof.

129
00:05:52,370 --> 00:05:53,203
Uh,
the,

130
00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:53,771
the,
the,

131
00:05:53,771 --> 00:05:54,604
the burden of proof is not upon the 
individual to make the case his or her 

132
00:05:58,220 --> 00:06:01,550
freedom.
It's upon the state to make the case,

133
00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:03,980
to Intro to,
to override that freedom.

134
00:06:04,180 --> 00:06:07,670
And I believe in libertarian or 
classical liberals as I think of them,

135
00:06:07,820 --> 00:06:11,180
believed that that burden is a real one 
and it's a heavy one.

136
00:06:11,330 --> 00:06:16,330
Sometimes it can be met,
but too often the reverse is in place.

137
00:06:16,581 --> 00:06:20,150
People believe that you have to,
that the burden is on those of us who,

138
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:22,850
who defend freedom to make the case for 
freedom.

139
00:06:23,180 --> 00:06:24,013
And I think it's backwards.
So basically you view it as sort of a 

140
00:06:25,791 --> 00:06:26,624
bottom up way of looking at things.
It's about the individual first and the 

141
00:06:29,691 --> 00:06:32,450
government is not giving you your 
freedom.

142
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:34,190
It can take it away,
however,

143
00:06:34,191 --> 00:06:36,700
by instituting all sorts of policies.
Yeah,

144
00:06:36,710 --> 00:06:38,030
I,
I'm in this case,

145
00:06:38,031 --> 00:06:38,864
I am A.
I think John Locke was right in John 

146
00:06:41,420 --> 00:06:42,253
Locke,
wasn't the only person he put John Lott 

147
00:06:42,851 --> 00:06:45,410
most famously in a,
made the argument in this,

148
00:06:45,460 --> 00:06:48,170
in the secondary of some government 
that,

149
00:06:48,430 --> 00:06:49,320
um,
uh,

150
00:06:49,410 --> 00:06:50,243
you know,
human beings have rights and human 

151
00:06:53,841 --> 00:06:56,290
beings delegate to the government,
uh,

152
00:06:56,510 --> 00:06:58,650
powers that you,
that,

153
00:06:58,710 --> 00:06:59,543
that,
those who do the delegation believe are 

154
00:07:01,731 --> 00:07:04,310
appropriate for the government to defend
those rights.

155
00:07:04,740 --> 00:07:05,573
Um,
you can quibble about how historically 

156
00:07:07,671 --> 00:07:10,000
accurate that is,
but I like,

157
00:07:10,130 --> 00:07:13,850
I think that perspective is 
philosophically correct.

158
00:07:14,250 --> 00:07:15,083
Uh,
no government gives me or you rights 

159
00:07:18,050 --> 00:07:21,800
governments are excellent at offending 
rights and taking them away.

160
00:07:22,260 --> 00:07:23,210
Uh,
but,

161
00:07:23,330 --> 00:07:24,163
but just because government is to 
protect your rights doesn't mean he 

162
00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:27,613
gives us rights just because farmers,
because we couldn't live without 

163
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:33,410
farmers,
if no one grew food and,

164
00:07:33,750 --> 00:07:35,240
and,
and did ranching,

165
00:07:35,241 --> 00:07:36,074
we would all starve.
That doesn't mean that we owe our lives 

166
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:39,860
to farmers.
Uh,

167
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:43,070
one of the great things about the 
society that we live in is that it's a,

168
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:44,033
it was called the great society to be 
distinguished from when the Johnson's 

169
00:07:46,431 --> 00:07:49,910
great society and that is,
it is a society of many,

170
00:07:49,911 --> 00:07:53,330
many individuals each specialized in 
doing various things.

171
00:07:53,450 --> 00:07:55,460
We're all coordinated by the price 
system in,

172
00:07:55,461 --> 00:07:56,570
by the rule of law.

173
00:07:56,850 --> 00:07:57,683
Uh,
and so each of us makes a contribution 

174
00:07:58,881 --> 00:08:03,881
to the welfare of others,
but no one of us is utterly essential.

175
00:08:04,670 --> 00:08:08,540
And that's a really good system,
I believe.

176
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:09,433
Yeah.
So I want to talk more about hiking a 

177
00:08:10,341 --> 00:08:12,680
little bit because you do run the cafe 
high Eq blog.

178
00:08:12,930 --> 00:08:13,763
Uh,
you mentioned the burden of proof that 

179
00:08:14,901 --> 00:08:15,734
the government has to meet to say when 
it's right to actually infringe on some 

180
00:08:20,871 --> 00:08:22,900
of your rights or basically do things.
Yeah.

181
00:08:23,330 --> 00:08:24,163
So this is where I would say the 
classical liberal and Libertarian 

182
00:08:26,241 --> 00:08:27,410
positions that are a little bit 
different.

183
00:08:27,411 --> 00:08:28,244
I see some utility for the state,
although I'd usually want it done at 

184
00:08:30,681 --> 00:08:31,970
the,
at the state level,

185
00:08:31,971 --> 00:08:32,804
not the federal level and libertarians.
It's sort of hard to pin on when it's 

186
00:08:35,661 --> 00:08:37,970
enough.
And you alluded to that when you talk to

187
00:08:37,971 --> 00:08:40,580
libertarians,
how do you get to a place where,

188
00:08:40,610 --> 00:08:42,260
where it's not,
you know,

189
00:08:42,261 --> 00:08:43,094
I always make the joke,
it's like eventually you'll just be in 

190
00:08:44,391 --> 00:08:49,250
mad max or the true anarcho capitalists,
which I enjoy talking to,

191
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:52,910
but I view it as more of an intellectual
exercise than a practical.

192
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:53,410
Yeah,
I mean,

193
00:08:53,410 --> 00:08:54,243
I,
I'm very sympathetic anarcho and 

194
00:08:55,501 --> 00:08:56,550
philosophically I'm,
yeah,

195
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:57,720
but I'm not a,
I'm not a,

196
00:08:57,840 --> 00:08:58,950
a,
a,

197
00:08:59,060 --> 00:09:02,430
a blow things up kind of guy and I'm way
too much of a hierarchy.

198
00:09:02,431 --> 00:09:06,840
And to understand that you just can't 
replace social institutions.

199
00:09:06,841 --> 00:09:11,740
Wholesale Society has to evolve to 
wherever it's going to be from March,

200
00:09:11,750 --> 00:09:13,350
from being a realist.
I mean,

201
00:09:13,410 --> 00:09:14,540
you couldn't blow it up.
I say,

202
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:15,151
Oh,
well,

203
00:09:15,151 --> 00:09:15,984
yes you could.
But history has a lot of really telling 

204
00:09:18,901 --> 00:09:19,734
examples about attempts to blow up 
societies wholesale in those examples 

205
00:09:23,461 --> 00:09:25,910
have never turned out well in practice.
Uh,

206
00:09:26,450 --> 00:09:31,200
let me say among the people who will 
call themselves classical liberals,

207
00:09:31,580 --> 00:09:34,920
right?
None of them are ever at a w,

208
00:09:34,930 --> 00:09:35,763
whatever,
express any sympathy for animal 

209
00:09:36,931 --> 00:09:39,900
capitalism among Libertarians.
Some of them will say,

210
00:09:39,901 --> 00:09:40,734
oh no,
I,

211
00:09:40,860 --> 00:09:42,360
I believe there's a role for the 
government,

212
00:09:42,630 --> 00:09:43,380
but you do it.

213
00:09:43,380 --> 00:09:45,330
People who classify themselves as 
Libertarians who say,

214
00:09:45,450 --> 00:09:47,070
at least,
at least in principle,

215
00:09:47,340 --> 00:09:48,173
I believe that the society could exist 
without any formal institution have 

216
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:56,570
monopolized coercion and I,
I am in that latter latter.

217
00:09:56,580 --> 00:09:58,770
Yeah.
I might be the one classical liberal who

218
00:09:58,771 --> 00:09:59,710
will do it,
or maybe that.

219
00:09:59,770 --> 00:10:01,710
Maybe by that definition I'm a little 
more libertarian,

220
00:10:01,711 --> 00:10:02,490
but again,
these things.

221
00:10:02,490 --> 00:10:03,170
Oh yeah.
Yeah.

222
00:10:03,170 --> 00:10:03,540
We're,
you know,

223
00:10:03,540 --> 00:10:04,373
it's really sort of the narcissism of 
small differences in exactly in this 

224
00:10:06,841 --> 00:10:07,830
little place.
All right,

225
00:10:07,831 --> 00:10:11,270
so what are some of the basic 
principles?

226
00:10:11,370 --> 00:10:12,203
You're a professor,
what are the basic principles that 

227
00:10:13,711 --> 00:10:17,520
people should know about economics?
I know I'm giving you a wide one there,

228
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:20,700
but for someone watching this,
that that's waiting for their 19,

229
00:10:20,701 --> 00:10:25,350
77 moment.
So in no particular order,

230
00:10:25,390 --> 00:10:26,280
right?
Number one,

231
00:10:26,460 --> 00:10:30,090
scarcity is unavoidable.
We live in a world of scarce resources,

232
00:10:30,210 --> 00:10:33,510
which means that if you use some 
resources to do this good thing,

233
00:10:33,930 --> 00:10:36,990
you take resources away from the ability
to do other good things.

234
00:10:36,990 --> 00:10:37,823
They both good things,
but we have to choose do we want to do 

235
00:10:39,601 --> 00:10:40,950
this good thing or do we want to do 
that?

236
00:10:40,951 --> 00:10:41,784
Good thing.
Second thing to note in order to make 

237
00:10:43,921 --> 00:10:45,160
that decision,
uh,

238
00:10:45,270 --> 00:10:49,620
we want the people involved who are 
going to be affected both by the loss of

239
00:10:49,621 --> 00:10:54,000
that which is not done and by the 
benefit of that which is done to express

240
00:10:54,001 --> 00:10:55,450
their opinions honestly,
how,

241
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:56,333
how valuable is this thing that we 
propose to do and how valuable is this 

242
00:10:59,791 --> 00:11:03,030
thing that we propose to give up in 
order to do this first thing?

243
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:04,500
And,
and to do that,

244
00:11:04,530 --> 00:11:05,251
we,
you,

245
00:11:05,251 --> 00:11:06,084
you need people on the ground who are 
actually affected by these decisions to 

246
00:11:08,881 --> 00:11:11,310
have a,
a meaningful say.

247
00:11:11,311 --> 00:11:14,460
You don't want a third party looking 
down making declarations.

248
00:11:14,580 --> 00:11:16,170
Oh,
I think you should have that.

249
00:11:16,171 --> 00:11:18,240
And I think you should not have had 
that.

250
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:19,073
So any social mechanism that gives each 
of us as much of a say as possible in 

251
00:11:26,250 --> 00:11:28,210
how we use resources and,
and,

252
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:32,060
and make the evaluations about what 
will,

253
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:36,330
what will happen if we use resources in 
this way and what will give up if we use

254
00:11:36,331 --> 00:11:39,120
resources in this way that that's 
important.

255
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:44,360
Unintended consequences is another 
important concept.

256
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:45,271
Uh,
you know,

257
00:11:45,271 --> 00:11:46,104
Adam Smith in the wealth of nations 
which is rightly considered to be the 

258
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:52,620
start starting point of modern 
scientific economics.

259
00:11:52,930 --> 00:11:53,763
He,
he famously talked about the invisible 

260
00:11:55,271 --> 00:11:56,104
hand and this is,
is this the sort of an unintended 

261
00:11:59,051 --> 00:12:02,260
consequences kind of explanations,
not from the benevolence of the butcher,

262
00:12:02,261 --> 00:12:03,940
the brewer there,
Baker that we expect our dinner,

263
00:12:03,941 --> 00:12:05,970
but from their regard to their own 
interests,

264
00:12:06,700 --> 00:12:10,150
they don't dislike you.
They value as a customer,

265
00:12:10,151 --> 00:12:14,260
but they are doing their jobs,
not primarily to help you.

266
00:12:14,260 --> 00:12:18,460
They're doing their jobs to help 
themselves and you are buying from them,

267
00:12:18,461 --> 00:12:19,294
not primarily to help them,
but primarily to help you and your 

268
00:12:20,951 --> 00:12:22,240
family.
And in that way,

269
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:23,313
everyone's either.
So this is a good unintended 

270
00:12:24,401 --> 00:12:25,270
consequence,
but you have,

271
00:12:25,510 --> 00:12:29,740
you have bad unintended consequences as 
well as one of my favorite examples of a

272
00:12:29,741 --> 00:12:32,620
bad unintended consequences.
The minimum wage raise the minimum wage.

273
00:12:32,621 --> 00:12:36,310
It looks like you helping low skill 
workers if you might help some of them,

274
00:12:36,311 --> 00:12:37,144
but in fact you putting other low 
skilled workers out of jobs and you're 

275
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:41,380
keeping them out of the job market for 
longer.

276
00:12:41,650 --> 00:12:45,490
And so economists think what makes a 
good economist,

277
00:12:45,790 --> 00:12:46,623
which distinguishes a good economist 
from a bad economist or non economist 

278
00:12:48,790 --> 00:12:49,623
is,
is a consistency and asking questions 

279
00:12:52,030 --> 00:12:55,150
always asking as compared to what?
As compared to what,

280
00:12:55,270 --> 00:12:57,400
where did that come from?
How are we going to pay for that?

281
00:12:57,430 --> 00:12:59,370
What did this cost,
uh,

282
00:12:59,590 --> 00:13:00,423
uh,
what will be the longterm consequences 

283
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:05,290
down the road beyond the immediate ones 
that,

284
00:13:05,370 --> 00:13:08,070
that everyone can see.
So it's just a,

285
00:13:08,071 --> 00:13:10,330
it's just a consistency and asking those
questions.

286
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:10,841
You know,
it's funny,

287
00:13:10,841 --> 00:13:14,590
as you're answering the question,
it keeps making me think,

288
00:13:14,591 --> 00:13:15,424
well,
this shows you why politics is so 

289
00:13:16,781 --> 00:13:17,614
screwed up because they get up,
they're all politicians on either side 

290
00:13:20,381 --> 00:13:23,290
and they either say $15 minimum wage,
Bernie or trump,

291
00:13:23,291 --> 00:13:25,590
I'm going to cut taxes on you.
Or they,

292
00:13:25,620 --> 00:13:27,580
you know,
they loved their bumper sticker stuff,

293
00:13:27,850 --> 00:13:31,690
but nobody's ever said unintended 
consequences in a presidential debate.

294
00:13:31,900 --> 00:13:34,330
So how frustrating less that be as an 
economist,

295
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:35,193
listening to people who are not 
economists who really aren't experts in 

296
00:13:38,261 --> 00:13:39,094
much of anything,
I don't know that Bernie has ever 

297
00:13:39,941 --> 00:13:40,774
created a business or made anyone make a
dollar off and I'm not aware of it 

298
00:13:44,650 --> 00:13:45,483
overnight.

299
00:13:45,630 --> 00:13:46,463
But that must be incredibly frustrating 
to hear non pros talk about the things 

300
00:13:51,761 --> 00:13:53,650
that you're a pro at.
It is Dave and you know,

301
00:13:53,651 --> 00:13:56,620
it's especially frustrating about it.
It's not rocket science.

302
00:13:57,260 --> 00:13:59,620
I mean,
I love economics.

303
00:13:59,621 --> 00:14:00,454
I love my profession and I really admire
the best among my professional 

304
00:14:04,121 --> 00:14:06,490
colleagues,
Milton Friedman and high Eq.

305
00:14:07,150 --> 00:14:07,983
But it's not rocket science.
It's just this consistency of always 

306
00:14:11,201 --> 00:14:16,120
understanding that there are 
consequences beyond the immediate,

307
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:17,410
uh,
that,

308
00:14:17,411 --> 00:14:21,190
that there's always a cost to something,
uh,

309
00:14:21,340 --> 00:14:23,410
that no matter how beneficial something 
is,

310
00:14:23,411 --> 00:14:26,800
it has to be weighed against that cost.
So these simple,

311
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:28,673
a simple understanding and the 
consistency and applying that 

312
00:14:32,021 --> 00:14:33,550
understanding,
it's not difficult,

313
00:14:34,090 --> 00:14:36,190
but so few people do it.
So it is,

314
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:38,830
it is frustrating.
You.

315
00:14:39,310 --> 00:14:40,890
Years ago I stopped.
I,

316
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,180
I joke that I stopped watching the 
evening.

317
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:45,720
People my age used to watch the evening 
news,

318
00:14:45,750 --> 00:14:45,970
right?

319
00:14:45,970 --> 00:14:47,730
I remember it.
I have some recollection,

320
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:50,110
hey man,
I had to stop watching the news.

321
00:14:50,111 --> 00:14:53,410
I was always threatened to throw my 
shoes through the,

322
00:14:53,740 --> 00:14:56,420
through the screen because the 
reporters,

323
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:58,820
they would very much like the 
politicians,

324
00:14:58,910 --> 00:15:00,620
they would report on the immediate 
effect,

325
00:15:00,621 --> 00:15:02,410
Oh,
the minimum wage is going to rise.

326
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:06,360
That that means that workers will get a 
raise of whatever the amount is as well.

327
00:15:06,370 --> 00:15:08,750
What it does it,
it means that for some workers,

328
00:15:08,751 --> 00:15:11,510
but it means also other workers are 
gonna lose their jobs.

329
00:15:11,690 --> 00:15:12,523
Some jobs,
the nature of those jobs are going to 

330
00:15:13,791 --> 00:15:14,624
change.
Employers aren't just going to sit back 

331
00:15:15,561 --> 00:15:16,371
and say,
oh,

332
00:15:16,371 --> 00:15:17,810
well we've got to pay higher minimum 
wages,

333
00:15:17,811 --> 00:15:20,000
so let's just be higher minimum wage.
Where's that money coming from?

334
00:15:20,001 --> 00:15:22,490
Where are those resources coming from?
They have to come from somewhere.

335
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:25,070
Yeah.
So basically your argument would be that

336
00:15:25,071 --> 00:15:25,904
the government's only role in the 
economy is to make sure we're not 

337
00:15:28,791 --> 00:15:30,350
killing each other pretty much.

338
00:15:30,350 --> 00:15:31,183
Right?
Like it really it's a total laissez 

339
00:15:33,201 --> 00:15:34,550
faire at.
Yes.

340
00:15:34,610 --> 00:15:35,443
I am a very laissez faire guy if,
if property rights are well defined and 

341
00:15:39,351 --> 00:15:40,184
secure,
and there's a strong case of government 

342
00:15:42,890 --> 00:15:43,723
plays a role of Ken play,
a role in helping to define and 

343
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:50,570
certainly helping to secure property 
rights.

344
00:15:50,620 --> 00:15:51,453
So that's where your contract rights.
So that's where you're not in Oracle 

345
00:15:53,860 --> 00:15:54,650
capitalists,
right?

346
00:15:54,650 --> 00:15:54,951
Well,
I'm,

347
00:15:54,951 --> 00:15:55,930
I'm,
I'm close to being right.

348
00:15:56,020 --> 00:15:56,811
I mean,
I,

349
00:15:56,811 --> 00:15:58,430
I'm,
I'm willing.

350
00:15:58,490 --> 00:16:01,290
I'm willing to admit that we're 
gradually giving that to Devon.

351
00:16:01,350 --> 00:16:02,183
I'm willing.
I'm willing to admit that anarcho 

352
00:16:03,531 --> 00:16:06,500
capitalism might not be a,
uh,

353
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:09,290
uh,
ultimately a defensible position.

354
00:16:09,350 --> 00:16:14,350
I am not willing to admit that free 
markets are an indefensible position.

355
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:17,750
However,
property rights come to be.

356
00:16:17,751 --> 00:16:19,400
However,
they are defined,

357
00:16:19,401 --> 00:16:20,234
however they are enforced when you have 
secure private property rights and 

358
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:26,113
freedom of contract,
which includes importantly the freedom 

359
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:28,873
to say,
no,

360
00:16:29,630 --> 00:16:31,340
I have the freedom to not contract.

361
00:16:31,870 --> 00:16:32,703
Uh,
then people are led to pursue their 

362
00:16:36,110 --> 00:16:40,430
people in pursuing their own interest,
are obliged to help others out.

363
00:16:40,700 --> 00:16:43,970
And that's how this great society that 
we live in and it is great,

364
00:16:44,450 --> 00:16:45,283
uh,
continues to grow and become more 

365
00:16:47,301 --> 00:16:48,410
prosperous.
Yeah.

366
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:50,870
So I mentioned to you right before we 
started that,

367
00:16:51,110 --> 00:16:51,943
you know,
I've had a political awakening of sorts 

368
00:16:53,301 --> 00:16:55,130
and I always say to people,
I didn't really move,

369
00:16:55,131 --> 00:16:55,964
but the left went so bananas.
I ended up being friends with all these 

370
00:16:58,581 --> 00:17:00,440
Libertarians and conservatives and 
whatever,

371
00:17:00,470 --> 00:17:02,750
whatever it is,
even for the differences we may have,

372
00:17:02,751 --> 00:17:03,584
but one place I have shifted is that I 
am much more aware you are economically 

373
00:17:07,251 --> 00:17:08,084
now and partly that's because I now run 
my own business and have employees and 

374
00:17:12,021 --> 00:17:12,854
have to deal with that.
And I just wrote to obscene lehigh 

375
00:17:15,411 --> 00:17:17,540
checks for taxes for the year.

376
00:17:17,540 --> 00:17:18,710
I mean,
we are in California.

377
00:17:18,711 --> 00:17:21,560
You don't want to know him like that one
was in the federal loans even worse,

378
00:17:21,561 --> 00:17:24,770
and it's like you're more successful.
I get the harder I work,

379
00:17:24,771 --> 00:17:25,604
the more they want to take from you.
And I tweeted something about that on 

380
00:17:28,161 --> 00:17:30,530
tax day and a lot of people were angry 
at me and said,

381
00:17:30,830 --> 00:17:31,663
well,
it's,

382
00:17:31,810 --> 00:17:33,740
it's,
this is the price to pay for success.

383
00:17:33,741 --> 00:17:36,890
Would you rather be poor?
And I didn't want to go on a major tweet

384
00:17:36,891 --> 00:17:39,580
storm and you wisely or not on twitter,
but could you,

385
00:17:39,630 --> 00:17:42,290
could you give me something that,
if I ever get in that fight again,

386
00:17:42,291 --> 00:17:44,990
I can say to people why that's not the 
right way to think.

387
00:17:45,110 --> 00:17:46,940
So let me start off with just asking 
you.

388
00:17:46,941 --> 00:17:50,880
Have you heard the story about George 
Mcgovern when he retired from politics?

389
00:17:51,300 --> 00:17:52,670
He a big sale,
please say,

390
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:55,020
so George Mcgovern,
he retired from politics.

391
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:58,910
I think I have the details right.
He certainly had the major part of it.

392
00:17:59,100 --> 00:18:01,630
He started the BNB,
uh,

393
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:02,151
you know,
in,

394
00:18:02,151 --> 00:18:03,470
in,
in his home state already.

395
00:18:03,471 --> 00:18:04,670
Like where this is going.
Yeah.

396
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:06,113
And,
uh,

397
00:18:06,380 --> 00:18:08,820
then he encounters all these 
regulations,

398
00:18:08,821 --> 00:18:10,290
you know,
labor regulations,

399
00:18:10,291 --> 00:18:12,240
safety regulations,
uh,

400
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:15,210
and he admits,
I can't remember now to whom he admitted

401
00:18:15,211 --> 00:18:16,400
as a long time ago.
He didn't,

402
00:18:16,410 --> 00:18:17,101
he,
he admits,

403
00:18:17,101 --> 00:18:17,431
he said,
you know,

404
00:18:17,431 --> 00:18:19,350
I've spent all my,
I'm not quoting him,

405
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:22,740
I'm going from memory.
So I spent all my life pushing for these

406
00:18:22,741 --> 00:18:23,574
things.
I was sufficiently attentive to the 

407
00:18:26,701 --> 00:18:28,550
downside of,
of,

408
00:18:28,610 --> 00:18:31,380
of,
of these taxes and these regulations.

409
00:18:31,870 --> 00:18:33,590
And so it's easy to,
you know,

410
00:18:33,610 --> 00:18:38,130
to sit in Sacramento to sit in 
Washington dc to sit in some,

411
00:18:38,750 --> 00:18:39,960
you know,
local government,

412
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:45,000
a office building and tell other people 
how to live and to tell other people how

413
00:18:45,001 --> 00:18:46,980
much money they have to give to you.

414
00:18:47,010 --> 00:18:50,010
And you can be well intentioned in the 
best sense of the term,

415
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:51,473
but you are not those other people and 
those other people are bearing 

416
00:18:54,061 --> 00:18:57,030
consequences and they know of things 
that you don't understand.

417
00:18:57,390 --> 00:18:58,410
And so on,
on the,

418
00:18:58,411 --> 00:18:59,180
on the,
on the,

419
00:18:59,180 --> 00:19:02,400
on the tax thing,
I like what,

420
00:19:02,450 --> 00:19:05,190
uh,
my friend Ed Crane said about,

421
00:19:05,380 --> 00:19:06,213
uh,
the famous quotation that is above the 

422
00:19:08,431 --> 00:19:13,431
door of the IRS building in Washington.
It's a quotation from justice Oliver,

423
00:19:14,071 --> 00:19:16,560
Wendell Holmes who said,
I think this exact quotation,

424
00:19:16,710 --> 00:19:18,570
taxation is the price you pay for 
civilization.

425
00:19:19,020 --> 00:19:19,980
And Crane says,
no,

426
00:19:20,250 --> 00:19:21,083
that's wrong.
Taxation is the price we pay for being 

427
00:19:23,371 --> 00:19:27,570
insufficiently civil law.
Civilization is,

428
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:31,050
is when we cooperate peacefully to help 
each other.

429
00:19:31,550 --> 00:19:32,383
And so even if we grant that there is 
some role for government and once you 

430
00:19:34,141 --> 00:19:34,974
granted some role for government,
it's very difficult to not see that 

431
00:19:37,621 --> 00:19:38,454
there's some appropriate level of 
taxation to fund that role for 

432
00:19:41,431 --> 00:19:42,230
government.

433
00:19:42,230 --> 00:19:45,420
Uh,
how much that may be true that we need,

434
00:19:45,421 --> 00:19:50,160
that it represents a failure of us as a 
society to become fully civilized.

435
00:19:50,161 --> 00:19:50,994
We've somehow not managed to figure out 
how to cooperate peacefully and 

436
00:19:53,941 --> 00:19:54,774
voluntarily in those matters in ways 
that we have managed to discover how to 

437
00:19:58,951 --> 00:19:59,784
cooperate peacefully and voluntarily and
doing what we're doing here today and 

438
00:20:01,801 --> 00:20:02,634
going to the supermarket and the 
supermarket dealing with the various 

439
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:07,320
suppliers that,
that it has.

440
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:09,740
None of that is,
is funded with taxation,

441
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:12,630
so all funded with voluntary voluntary 
payments.

442
00:20:12,780 --> 00:20:13,613
That is civilization.
So I liked the notion that the taxation 

443
00:20:17,130 --> 00:20:18,460
is a,
it's,

444
00:20:18,540 --> 00:20:19,373
it's sort of a measure of how little we 
are civilized or how far we have to go 

445
00:20:22,551 --> 00:20:25,390
to be completely civilized to make sure 
we're not killing each other.

446
00:20:26,210 --> 00:20:26,890
Yeah,
yeah.

447
00:20:26,890 --> 00:20:28,320
Yeah.
So.

448
00:20:28,410 --> 00:20:29,243
All right.
I want to get back to a couple things 

449
00:20:29,821 --> 00:20:30,750
you said there.
So first.

450
00:20:30,751 --> 00:20:32,370
Okay.
I know that I know that the minimum wage

451
00:20:32,371 --> 00:20:33,600
is,
is a big one for you.

452
00:20:33,601 --> 00:20:34,434
And even just this morning I write 
another story about how Bernie wants 

453
00:20:36,271 --> 00:20:37,104
this $15 minimum wage.
The anecdote that I keep using or 

454
00:20:39,571 --> 00:20:41,600
anecdote that I keep using is that I 
keep traveling,

455
00:20:41,610 --> 00:20:43,170
traveling all over the country right 
now,

456
00:20:43,410 --> 00:20:48,040
and in almost every airport you go to 
fast food places and they don't have

457
00:20:48,100 --> 00:20:50,080
people anymore.
They have ipads.

458
00:20:50,081 --> 00:20:50,914
Yes.
Now perhaps if you could pay people 

459
00:20:52,661 --> 00:20:54,520
less,
people would have jobs.

460
00:20:54,521 --> 00:20:56,170
It wouldn't be the greatest job in the 
world,

461
00:20:56,171 --> 00:20:57,730
but it would be the way it's always 
worked.

462
00:20:57,970 --> 00:20:58,803
Now we are literally replacing people 
with robots that may be inevitable no 

463
00:21:01,961 --> 00:21:02,794
matter what,
but to say that you have to pay people 

464
00:21:05,560 --> 00:21:07,360
again,
even from my own business here,

465
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:09,670
I get people offering to work for me for
free all the time.

466
00:21:09,671 --> 00:21:12,610
I want to pay people appropriately and 
we do pay all our people.

467
00:21:13,050 --> 00:21:13,883
Um,
but the idea that the government would 

468
00:21:15,611 --> 00:21:19,510
force me to pay someone x amount,
it seems completely bananas.

469
00:21:19,630 --> 00:21:20,270
Yeah.
So

470
00:21:20,270 --> 00:21:22,290
the minimum wage,
uh,

471
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:25,730
puts low many low skill workers,
auto jobs.

472
00:21:25,940 --> 00:21:26,773
If,
if,

473
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:27,833
uh,
a teenager is not worth $7 and twenty 

474
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:31,753
five cents per hour,
employers who are not in the charity 

475
00:21:33,411 --> 00:21:36,320
business are not going to hire that 
teenager at that price,

476
00:21:36,321 --> 00:21:39,450
that teenager will go without a job or 
go without a job in the,

477
00:21:39,590 --> 00:21:40,423
in the above ground economy,
make find a job paying more in the 

478
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,370
underground economy,
which is a different set of problems.

479
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:47,713
Uh,
and so that is the major unintended 

480
00:21:49,371 --> 00:21:51,770
consequence of the minimum wage there.
There are others,

481
00:21:51,771 --> 00:21:52,850
but that,
that's the big one.

482
00:21:53,210 --> 00:21:55,670
Um,
and if,

483
00:21:55,870 --> 00:21:56,571
uh,
you know,

484
00:21:56,571 --> 00:21:58,070
what people like Bernie Sanders,
I mean,

485
00:21:58,080 --> 00:21:58,913
because I speak to proponents of the 
minimum wage all the time with most of 

486
00:22:02,901 --> 00:22:03,734
them do,
they just stopped the analysis at the 

487
00:22:08,061 --> 00:22:09,230
surface.
Oh,

488
00:22:09,231 --> 00:22:11,610
wouldn't it be better to be paid $15 an 
hour and said,

489
00:22:11,690 --> 00:22:12,530
of course.

490
00:22:12,710 --> 00:22:14,570
So this is,
they don't want to get to the unintended

491
00:22:14,580 --> 00:22:19,580
consequences,
but I think because I think because most

492
00:22:19,581 --> 00:22:20,414
of them believe that they just had this 
image of employers as being a really 

493
00:22:24,051 --> 00:22:28,130
rich,
a highly profitable operations.

494
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:30,680
And so if you raise the minimum wage,
oh sure,

495
00:22:30,681 --> 00:22:31,514
it has a cost,
but the cost that's going to be born 

496
00:22:32,601 --> 00:22:35,510
exclusively by employers,
but it's a fact.

497
00:22:35,530 --> 00:22:39,080
Most low skilled workers work in highly 
competitive industries.

498
00:22:39,081 --> 00:22:40,880
They work in food retail,
you know,

499
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:43,270
they work at lawn care,
they,

500
00:22:43,310 --> 00:22:44,500
they,
they work in,

501
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:45,400
in,
in,

502
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:46,940
in supermarkets,
restaurants.

503
00:22:47,220 --> 00:22:50,390
These are highly competitive industries.
So there's no big profit margin.

504
00:22:50,490 --> 00:22:51,323
They are.
So when you raise the minimum wage is 

505
00:22:52,281 --> 00:22:54,290
not coming out of the profits of the 
employers.

506
00:22:54,500 --> 00:22:58,610
It has to come out of some change in the
way the employers do their business.

507
00:22:58,730 --> 00:23:00,340
There's nothing wrong with automation,
of course.

508
00:23:00,340 --> 00:23:01,500
Yeah.
But there's a,

509
00:23:01,650 --> 00:23:05,600
there's a proper amount of automation 
and if you raise the minimum wage,

510
00:23:05,660 --> 00:23:08,080
you get too much automation,
uh,

511
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:12,020
because you put and too few human 
workers.

512
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:14,270
And here's,
I just want to make this clear,

513
00:23:14,420 --> 00:23:17,030
here's another unintended consequence of
the minimum wage.

514
00:23:17,210 --> 00:23:18,043
And not only does it deny income to 
those workers who lose their jobs worse 

515
00:23:22,491 --> 00:23:23,324
in most cases,
it denies those workers would what's 

516
00:23:26,060 --> 00:23:29,600
even more valuable,
namely the opportunity to get that first

517
00:23:29,660 --> 00:23:30,493
piece of job experience.
And so the 16 year old who otherwise 

518
00:23:33,561 --> 00:23:37,130
would have gotten the job without the 
minimum wage becomes a 17 year old or 18

519
00:23:37,131 --> 00:23:40,100
year old who's still a never employed 
person.

520
00:23:40,580 --> 00:23:43,160
Whereas otherwise they would have had 
job experience.

521
00:23:43,220 --> 00:23:43,950
And so it,
it,

522
00:23:43,950 --> 00:23:46,840
it swells,
officially swells the ranks of,

523
00:23:47,190 --> 00:23:49,250
of,
of unskilled workers.

524
00:23:49,280 --> 00:23:50,113
Would there be a direct correlation then
once you have this whole set of people 

525
00:23:53,181 --> 00:23:54,014
at this imaginary $15 minimum wage,
they are also going to raise prices on 

526
00:23:56,871 --> 00:23:57,920
basic things,
right?

527
00:23:58,010 --> 00:24:00,010
I mean,
is there a direct correlation?

528
00:24:00,620 --> 00:24:03,130
Price prices may rise a little bit 
because you get,

529
00:24:03,160 --> 00:24:03,993
you know,
the economy's a little bit less 

530
00:24:04,461 --> 00:24:06,800
efficient and so you get a little bit 
less output,

531
00:24:06,890 --> 00:24:10,760
but the price increases aren't,
aren't the major problem.

532
00:24:10,761 --> 00:24:15,761
The major problem is employers will find
ways to satisfy their customers,

533
00:24:16,110 --> 00:24:16,943
uh,
at slightly higher cost to the 

534
00:24:18,231 --> 00:24:21,140
employers,
but at huge cost to those workers who,

535
00:24:21,590 --> 00:24:24,740
who lose their jobs.
So when you've talked to kind of miss on

536
00:24:24,741 --> 00:24:27,890
the left that disagree with you on this,
and I get what you're saying,

537
00:24:27,891 --> 00:24:28,724
that they're not taking that next step.
I'm sure there's someone out there that 

538
00:24:30,771 --> 00:24:33,500
has made a sound argument that you just 
disagree with you.

539
00:24:35,020 --> 00:24:39,920
So there is one sound argument,
one sound theoretically,

540
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:42,540
one theoretically coherent argument for 
the minimum wage.

541
00:24:43,870 --> 00:24:48,870
And that is if employers have what's 
called monopsony power vent,

542
00:24:49,390 --> 00:24:50,940
then I'm going need you to find that 
one.

543
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:52,310
Yes,
monopsony power.

544
00:24:52,330 --> 00:24:55,130
It's like monopoly power.
Except so monopolist is the only seller.

545
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:57,270
A monopsony says the only buyer.
Okay?

546
00:24:57,740 --> 00:25:02,180
So if you're the only buyer of low skill
workers in the market,

547
00:25:02,370 --> 00:25:06,020
but you as an employer,
you then can be easily shown.

548
00:25:06,110 --> 00:25:10,220
You can keep wages lower than they would
otherwise be too low.

549
00:25:10,460 --> 00:25:11,293
And given that you,
it can be then shown that if the 

550
00:25:13,311 --> 00:25:15,730
government comes in and sets a minimum 
wage right,

551
00:25:15,890 --> 00:25:17,220
then,
uh,

552
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:18,553
the employer will in fact pay the higher
minimum wage and no employees will be 

553
00:25:23,601 --> 00:25:26,150
harmed.
But it's a very,

554
00:25:26,151 --> 00:25:31,130
very strict criteria are very,
very strict.

555
00:25:31,430 --> 00:25:32,263
And the idea that that Walmart and 
Mcdonald's and Burger King and KFC and 

556
00:25:37,341 --> 00:25:38,174
all the mom and pop restaurants and and 
made services and lawn care services 

557
00:25:42,171 --> 00:25:43,790
that we have throughout the United 
States,

558
00:25:43,850 --> 00:25:44,683
the idea that any one of these is a man 
alone monopoly buyer of low skill 

559
00:25:50,001 --> 00:25:51,350
workers is just absurd.

560
00:25:51,590 --> 00:25:52,423
All right,
so one of the things that you write 

561
00:25:52,881 --> 00:25:57,881
about a lot is that the idea of middle 
class stagnation is actually wrong.

562
00:25:58,310 --> 00:25:59,143
Yes.
We hear this all the time from 

563
00:26:00,501 --> 00:26:04,850
politicians for I think my whole life 
that I was ever caring about politics.

564
00:26:04,851 --> 00:26:05,684
It's always that the middle class is 
shrinking and the extremes are getting 

565
00:26:08,241 --> 00:26:09,260
bigger,
et Cetera,

566
00:26:09,261 --> 00:26:10,094
et cetera.
But you actually take a different 

567
00:26:11,301 --> 00:26:12,070
position on it.
Yeah.

568
00:26:12,070 --> 00:26:12,903
This middle class stagnation thesis is 
stated as if it's an established fact 

569
00:26:16,131 --> 00:26:17,560
with no arguments against it.
It's just,

570
00:26:17,630 --> 00:26:18,463
it's just wrong.
I think you were born in the mid 

571
00:26:20,150 --> 00:26:20,450
seventies,
right?

572
00:26:20,450 --> 00:26:21,590
Seventy six.
Okay.

573
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:24,130
So according to this thesis,
it was.

574
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:26,290
It was right around that time,
mid seventies when.

575
00:26:26,330 --> 00:26:27,500
Apologize.
That's okay.

576
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:28,833
It was your fault.
So the American middle class had been 

577
00:26:31,791 --> 00:26:34,910
chugging along,
upward hits the mid seventies,

578
00:26:34,911 --> 00:26:36,620
and then it's been stagnant ever since.

579
00:26:36,620 --> 00:26:37,453
So ordinary Americans today,
so goes the thesis lived no better than 

580
00:26:40,761 --> 00:26:44,100
ordinary Americans lived when Gerald 
Ford was in the Oval Office.

581
00:26:44,350 --> 00:26:45,720
I think this is crazy.
I mean,

582
00:26:45,721 --> 00:26:46,410
I have,
I'm,

583
00:26:46,410 --> 00:26:47,030
I'm,
uh,

584
00:26:47,030 --> 00:26:47,863
unfortunate old enough to remember the 
19 seventies and although one zone 

585
00:26:51,330 --> 00:26:54,750
personal experiences shouldn't be a 
basis for scientific conclusions,

586
00:26:54,810 --> 00:26:55,643
they're not irrelevant thing.
I know I come from a working class US 

587
00:26:59,940 --> 00:27:00,773
family.
I remember how we lived in the 

588
00:27:02,010 --> 00:27:03,270
seventies.
I remember what cars were like.

589
00:27:03,271 --> 00:27:05,640
I remember when television was like,
or what healthcare was like,

590
00:27:06,570 --> 00:27:09,240
things are a lot better today for 
ordinary Americans.

591
00:27:09,540 --> 00:27:12,530
And so a number of years ago just 
started looking into this,

592
00:27:12,680 --> 00:27:13,820
this thesis,
uh,

593
00:27:13,970 --> 00:27:14,803
the,
our data that you can find that the 

594
00:27:16,921 --> 00:27:20,100
people who propose this thesis a point 
to,

595
00:27:20,490 --> 00:27:21,670
uh,
that,

596
00:27:21,900 --> 00:27:25,620
that lends some superficial credence to 
the thesis.

597
00:27:25,650 --> 00:27:28,470
But here's just some of the problems 
with these data.

598
00:27:28,740 --> 00:27:29,573
Uh,
they adjust for inflation in ways that 

599
00:27:33,420 --> 00:27:34,253
vastly overestimate the amount of 
inflation that we've had since the mid 

600
00:27:37,710 --> 00:27:39,750
seventies.
So mean vastly under counting the growth

601
00:27:39,751 --> 00:27:43,020
in real incomes since the seventies.
A lot of these data,

602
00:27:43,021 --> 00:27:46,310
we'll look at household incomes,
uh,

603
00:27:46,410 --> 00:27:47,010
well,
the,

604
00:27:47,010 --> 00:27:47,843
the typical population of the American 
household has fallen since the mid 19 

605
00:27:52,141 --> 00:27:53,550
seventies.
Today it didn't sound like much,

606
00:27:53,551 --> 00:27:57,830
but today it's about 11 percent lower 
than it was in 1975 a.

607
00:27:58,050 --> 00:27:59,820
But that's actually a pretty 
significant.

608
00:27:59,821 --> 00:28:00,654
So the same amount of income and a 
household and it was spread over fewer 

609
00:28:03,091 --> 00:28:03,924
people.
And so the individual individual people 

610
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:06,193
are,
are,

611
00:28:06,290 --> 00:28:07,440
are,
are richer,

612
00:28:07,470 --> 00:28:10,710
meaning we're just not having as many 
kids that we're not having as many kids.

613
00:28:10,940 --> 00:28:11,773
We were becoming wealthier so that now,
well maybe not in the last 10 years or 

614
00:28:16,201 --> 00:28:17,520
so,
but for much of this period,

615
00:28:17,810 --> 00:28:18,643
uh,
younger people I've been able to move 

616
00:28:19,681 --> 00:28:22,380
out of their family,
their parents homes at a younger age and

617
00:28:22,381 --> 00:28:25,460
start the households younger,
uh,

618
00:28:25,530 --> 00:28:26,363
older people are able to continue to 
live by themselves rather than moving 

619
00:28:28,830 --> 00:28:30,300
with their,
with their children.

620
00:28:32,010 --> 00:28:37,010
The quality of goods and the variety of 
goods and services that Americans,

621
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:38,633
ordinary Americans have access to today 
is astonishing compared to what it was 

622
00:28:42,931 --> 00:28:43,764
just 40 years ago.
I actually spent a lot of time looking 

623
00:28:46,231 --> 00:28:49,400
at catalogs from the mid 19 seventies,
you know,

624
00:28:49,410 --> 00:28:53,880
sears roebuck catalogs,
and then you can look@sears.com

625
00:28:53,910 --> 00:28:58,350
today and you can look at the prices 
that we charge back that course.

626
00:28:58,351 --> 00:28:59,184
Nominally they will lower,
but then you just take those prices and 

627
00:29:01,681 --> 00:29:06,210
you divide them by the wage that the 
average American earned back then and do

628
00:29:06,211 --> 00:29:07,044
the same thing for the prices today and 
divided by the wage of the average 

629
00:29:09,601 --> 00:29:14,070
American owns today.
And what you find in almost all cases is

630
00:29:14,071 --> 00:29:14,904
that the amount of time it takes to work
in order to earn enough income to buy a 

631
00:29:18,061 --> 00:29:20,400
pair of jeans,
a shirt,

632
00:29:20,760 --> 00:29:21,593
a washer and dryer,
and an airplane ticket is dramatically 

633
00:29:26,191 --> 00:29:26,430
less.

634
00:29:26,430 --> 00:29:27,061
Today.
American.

635
00:29:27,061 --> 00:29:27,894
We don't have to work as much today as 
we did back then in order to get the 

636
00:29:29,671 --> 00:29:31,860
things that make our standard of living 
as high as it is.

637
00:29:31,960 --> 00:29:33,720
So did they.
Just the people that believe in this,

638
00:29:33,721 --> 00:29:35,370
that they just do a great sell job.
I mean,

639
00:29:35,371 --> 00:29:37,530
how did this meme,
how did this idea get out there?

640
00:29:37,531 --> 00:29:38,364
Because you hear this all the time.
This is one of the few things that you 

641
00:29:41,020 --> 00:29:42,730
hear on both sides of the aisle.
Yes.

642
00:29:42,760 --> 00:29:43,900
Yeah.
And in fact,

643
00:29:43,901 --> 00:29:44,734
I,
I,

644
00:29:44,990 --> 00:29:45,930
uh,
yes,

645
00:29:46,300 --> 00:29:47,133
I think the Paul Krugman says it all 
says it all the time and I think in a 

646
00:29:50,921 --> 00:29:53,290
way kind of backfire when people in the 
left because they keep saying it.

647
00:29:53,291 --> 00:29:54,124
And I believe that's one thing that 
helped the drum ups popular support for 

648
00:29:58,211 --> 00:29:59,230
Donald Trump.
You know,

649
00:29:59,260 --> 00:30:00,760
middle class Americans have been 
stagnating.

650
00:30:00,761 --> 00:30:02,020
So let's do something about it.

651
00:30:02,020 --> 00:30:02,853
Let's electronic.
There's an interesting psychological 

652
00:30:04,331 --> 00:30:08,410
thing there because I think maybe most 
people think they're in the middle,

653
00:30:08,411 --> 00:30:10,570
like they probably think it no matter 
what.

654
00:30:10,571 --> 00:30:11,404
Like they,
if they're not destitute and if they're 

655
00:30:12,521 --> 00:30:14,890
not worth $20,
million bucks,

656
00:30:14,891 --> 00:30:18,370
you probably think basically you're in 
the middle.

657
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:19,900
Yeah.
So it's a way of making it,

658
00:30:19,901 --> 00:30:22,600
about you,
even if it's actually not the case.

659
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:24,233
Your question,
if I'm not sure exactly exactly why it 

660
00:30:27,731 --> 00:30:28,564
caught by,
this myth caught on and it has held on 

661
00:30:31,001 --> 00:30:33,670
with such tenacity.
This myth has been going,

662
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:37,960
has been around now for 20 years.
It started in the mid 19 nineties and it

663
00:30:37,961 --> 00:30:40,090
was actually an economist.
He's now at southern,

664
00:30:40,510 --> 00:30:41,343
at Smu in Dallas.
He was at the time at an economist at 

665
00:30:42,911 --> 00:30:43,744
the Dallas Fed guy named Mike Cox,
and he's the first one who really 

666
00:30:46,721 --> 00:30:47,950
started looking into this.
I said,

667
00:30:47,951 --> 00:30:48,300
well,
let's,

668
00:30:48,300 --> 00:30:48,760
let's,
let's,

669
00:30:48,760 --> 00:30:52,850
let's look at various measures of living
standard.

670
00:30:52,850 --> 00:30:53,683
Let's look at how much ordinary people 
are consuming today compared to in the 

671
00:30:57,550 --> 00:30:58,260
mid seventies.
This will kind of,

672
00:30:58,260 --> 00:30:58,931
let's let,
let's,

673
00:30:58,931 --> 00:30:59,764
let's look at what happens when we 
adjust for income using better 

674
00:31:01,751 --> 00:31:03,300
inflation.
Adjusters come,

675
00:31:03,690 --> 00:31:04,523
uh,
Mike Cox Found that my work is 

676
00:31:08,021 --> 00:31:11,830
derivative of my cox is that once you 
start doing this,

677
00:31:11,860 --> 00:31:16,270
this whole middle class stagnation thing
just crumbled into dust.

678
00:31:16,271 --> 00:31:17,104
It's just not true.
It's not to say that there are no 

679
00:31:20,231 --> 00:31:21,064
problems.
It's not to say that the middleclass 

680
00:31:22,330 --> 00:31:25,160
wouldn't be even wealthier,
had not had,

681
00:31:25,170 --> 00:31:26,003
they'd been better policies in place.
Whatever you think those policies might 

682
00:31:28,751 --> 00:31:31,420
be,
but it is to say that it's just crazy to

683
00:31:31,421 --> 00:31:32,254
believe that an ordinary American or an 
ordinary American family in 2018 has a 

684
00:31:36,251 --> 00:31:37,084
standard of living that is 
indistinguishable from that of an 

685
00:31:38,591 --> 00:31:40,750
ordinary American family in 1975.
Yeah.

686
00:31:40,900 --> 00:31:41,733
Do you know what basically the economics
look like if you're considered in the 

687
00:31:45,701 --> 00:31:46,534
middle class right now,
like the economics there really like 

688
00:31:48,911 --> 00:31:50,800
numbers that you look at on both sides 
and go,

689
00:31:50,801 --> 00:31:51,634
all right,
that's what middle class is because I 

690
00:31:52,751 --> 00:31:53,560
think that's part of the problem.

691
00:31:53,560 --> 00:31:55,930
It is this sort of a morphis term.
Yes.

692
00:31:55,990 --> 00:31:56,690
Yeah.
Uh,

693
00:31:56,690 --> 00:31:59,090
I,
I don't believe that they are the,

694
00:31:59,150 --> 00:32:00,820
the Census Bureau.
Among others,

695
00:32:00,821 --> 00:32:04,060
they will divide household income into 
quintiles.

696
00:32:04,520 --> 00:32:07,060
Uh,
I don't recall what those numbers are at

697
00:32:07,061 --> 00:32:07,894
the moment,
but a common definition should take the 

698
00:32:10,150 --> 00:32:12,580
three middle quintile.
So you'd get rid of the top 20 percent.

699
00:32:12,581 --> 00:32:14,740
You were at the bottom 20 percent.
You have the middle 60 percent.

700
00:32:15,250 --> 00:32:17,230
That's the middle class and upper 
middle,

701
00:32:17,231 --> 00:32:17,681
middle,
middle,

702
00:32:17,681 --> 00:32:18,514
lower,
middle.

703
00:32:18,560 --> 00:32:19,393
Uh,
but the Census Bureau does something 

704
00:32:20,411 --> 00:32:21,244
interesting from time to time it out.
So it divides household income and two 

705
00:32:26,651 --> 00:32:28,560
different categories,
less than 15,000,

706
00:32:28,580 --> 00:32:30,020
15,000
to 25,000

707
00:32:30,070 --> 00:32:30,903
on it and on up to like I think 250,000
and above and attracts adjusting for 

708
00:32:36,341 --> 00:32:37,174
inflation.
It tracks household incomes over time 

709
00:32:40,610 --> 00:32:41,443
and you can in a perverse way finding 
these data that the middle class in 

710
00:32:45,681 --> 00:32:46,820
America is disappearing.

711
00:32:47,150 --> 00:32:47,983
Right?
But it's disappearing into the upper 

712
00:32:48,861 --> 00:32:49,694
classes.
If you look at the percentage of 

713
00:32:50,421 --> 00:32:55,421
households in America who are earning a 
in the lowest percentages,

714
00:32:56,280 --> 00:32:58,730
right?
They're shrinking the only,

715
00:32:59,130 --> 00:32:59,963
the only categories in which the 
percentage of households in the US are 

716
00:33:03,230 --> 00:33:06,440
increasing or in the upper income 
levels.

717
00:33:06,441 --> 00:33:07,274
And so actually I think the very lowest 
it might have ticked up a little bit 

718
00:33:09,620 --> 00:33:10,453
like the blessed in $15,000.
But in the great middle they have fewer 

719
00:33:14,210 --> 00:33:17,210
households percentagewise earning in 
those categories today,

720
00:33:17,790 --> 00:33:22,550
but more earning $100,000
annually and above.

721
00:33:22,850 --> 00:33:24,050
And so in one sense,
yes,

722
00:33:24,051 --> 00:33:25,130
it's tricky,
but it's getting Richard,

723
00:33:25,170 --> 00:33:26,930
there is no evidence that we're getting 
poor.

724
00:33:26,931 --> 00:33:27,764
There's no evidence that it

725
00:33:27,910 --> 00:33:28,601
meeting.
Yeah.

726
00:33:28,601 --> 00:33:32,740
So we talked a little bit in an 
ancillary way about taxes earlier,

727
00:33:33,070 --> 00:33:35,860
so I'm not an economist,
but I'm going to lay out what I think is

728
00:33:35,861 --> 00:33:36,694
sort of a fair tax system that's 
consistent with all the ideals that 

729
00:33:40,301 --> 00:33:42,210
we've talked about here.
And I want you to probably get.

730
00:33:42,230 --> 00:33:46,480
Have I had my ideas either I'm going to 
be either I'm going to blow your mind or

731
00:33:46,510 --> 00:33:48,070
you're going to tell me that I'm way 
off.

732
00:33:48,071 --> 00:33:50,830
So something like this,
this is what I've said a couple times,

733
00:33:51,190 --> 00:33:53,980
is that I'm basically four attacks a 
flat tax.

734
00:33:53,981 --> 00:33:57,160
You don't get rid of exemptions.
Let's say it's about 15 percent,

735
00:33:57,161 --> 00:33:58,690
but we can.
We can fiddle with the numbers,

736
00:33:58,691 --> 00:34:03,370
but it's about 15 percent.
I would exempt everyone making let's say

737
00:34:03,371 --> 00:34:04,204
less than like 40 grand,
maybe even 50 grand so that they have a 

738
00:34:07,691 --> 00:34:10,190
little more disposable income that they 
can do things which,

739
00:34:10,191 --> 00:34:12,040
which I think is good for them and good 
for the economy.

740
00:34:12,220 --> 00:34:13,053
And then just because I'm still,
I still have a little bit of a guilty 

741
00:34:15,641 --> 00:34:16,474
liberal in me.
I would even be willing to do some sort 

742
00:34:19,601 --> 00:34:24,601
of progressive tax if you're over say 10
million a year or something like that,

743
00:34:25,031 --> 00:34:25,864
even though I know it's not right,
and I'm sure you can get rid of that by 

744
00:34:28,421 --> 00:34:29,254
the end of this conversation,
but there's still a piece of me that 

745
00:34:30,971 --> 00:34:33,850
says that,
but basically saying that for the huge,

746
00:34:33,851 --> 00:34:34,684
vast majority of the country,
15 percent lidl exemptions may be a 

747
00:34:38,831 --> 00:34:39,664
little trickery on the high end.
I think that's consistent with the sort 

748
00:34:42,791 --> 00:34:45,670
of classical liberal idea of minimal 
involvement and,

749
00:34:45,720 --> 00:34:48,790
and equality of opportunity and what 
you're all paying in.

750
00:34:48,940 --> 00:34:51,070
And hopefully we'd call it a slimmer 
trimmer government,

751
00:34:51,190 --> 00:34:51,571
you know,
so.

752
00:34:51,571 --> 00:34:52,850
So some glimmering in your eye.

753
00:34:53,050 --> 00:34:53,420
Yeah.
Yeah.

754
00:34:53,420 --> 00:34:54,380
So,
so as I said earlier,

755
00:34:54,381 --> 00:34:56,970
I think one of the distinguishing 
features of an economist has always yes.

756
00:34:56,990 --> 00:34:57,823
Compared to what?
Right.

757
00:34:57,890 --> 00:34:59,690
As compared to what we have now.
I mean,

758
00:34:59,980 --> 00:35:00,830
that's,
that's,

759
00:35:00,910 --> 00:35:01,970
that's close to.
Perfect.

760
00:35:02,030 --> 00:35:02,863
All right.
I'll take it as compared to what my 

761
00:35:05,060 --> 00:35:07,580
actual ideal would be,
given that we're going to have taxes,

762
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:10,780
it's not quite my ideal.
I would indeed get rid of the,

763
00:35:11,210 --> 00:35:11,950
the,
the,

764
00:35:11,950 --> 00:35:14,930
the progression at.
That's just the guilty part of me.

765
00:35:14,931 --> 00:35:15,764
I think that still exists.
So the way I look at the way I look at 

766
00:35:19,851 --> 00:35:22,060
people who earn those kinds of incomes,
assuming they earn,

767
00:35:22,140 --> 00:35:24,680
and most of them do,
they earn these incomes in the market.

768
00:35:24,950 --> 00:35:25,783
That means that these people are 
especially good at making life better 

769
00:35:28,491 --> 00:35:29,324
for ordinary Americans.
They're especially good at creating 

770
00:35:30,831 --> 00:35:31,664
jobs.
They're especially good at increasing 

771
00:35:33,560 --> 00:35:35,000
the value of my 401k.

772
00:35:35,090 --> 00:35:35,923
But what would you say when people say,
but they don't need eight yachts and 

773
00:35:38,460 --> 00:35:40,160
helicopters and all that?
Uh,

774
00:35:40,310 --> 00:35:42,000
I would say they earned.
It's theirs.

775
00:35:42,030 --> 00:35:45,090
It's not up to me to say what they are.
It's their money.

776
00:35:45,091 --> 00:35:48,780
I can make an argument against that.
I know is there's a lot.

777
00:35:49,030 --> 00:35:49,863
Again,
your system is better than what we have 

778
00:35:51,541 --> 00:35:52,374
now,
but definitely if we're going to have 

779
00:35:54,481 --> 00:35:55,314
income,
taxation of flat tax and I'm willing to 

780
00:35:57,331 --> 00:35:59,460
have the exemption for the lower lower 
incomes,

781
00:35:59,640 --> 00:36:00,750
flat taxes,
the way to go.

782
00:36:00,990 --> 00:36:02,040
Uh,
uh,

783
00:36:02,070 --> 00:36:02,903
not only does it prevent a lot of 
political chicanery messing with 

784
00:36:07,740 --> 00:36:09,970
brackets and,
uh,

785
00:36:10,270 --> 00:36:11,103
but it,
it is economically a better system when 

786
00:36:14,701 --> 00:36:15,534
you tax all income earning activities at
the same rate than the relative prices 

787
00:36:20,371 --> 00:36:23,310
of different types of labor services 
stays the same.

788
00:36:23,430 --> 00:36:24,263
When you have progressive taxation,
you create greater distortions in the 

789
00:36:27,691 --> 00:36:31,080
economy and that,
that makes us as an,

790
00:36:31,550 --> 00:36:32,220
as,
as a,

791
00:36:32,220 --> 00:36:33,540
as residents of this economy.

792
00:36:33,540 --> 00:36:34,373
It makes us all a little bit less 
wealthy than we otherwise we'd be 

793
00:36:36,781 --> 00:36:38,820
because the economy has to deal with 
these distortions.

794
00:36:39,090 --> 00:36:42,480
So what do we do about spending?
Because at the end of the day,

795
00:36:42,481 --> 00:36:43,314
that seems,
at least when we're talking about this 

796
00:36:44,191 --> 00:36:45,024
from a government perspective,
it's really all about spending that you 

797
00:36:47,671 --> 00:36:51,240
can tax out the Wazoo and regardless of 
whether that tanks the economy or,

798
00:36:51,540 --> 00:36:54,240
or fixes it or whatever,
that that's almost irrelevant.

799
00:36:54,390 --> 00:36:56,880
If you just keep spending,
especially because of the amount of debt

800
00:36:56,881 --> 00:36:57,714
we have and we're,
we know we're never going to pay it 

801
00:36:58,951 --> 00:36:59,784
back.
Which is why it's probably good that we 

802
00:37:00,361 --> 00:37:02,150
have a lot of bombs,
but that's a whole other.

803
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:04,020
That's a whole other discussion,
um,

804
00:37:04,120 --> 00:37:04,953
you know,
because one day if China calls him the 

805
00:37:05,971 --> 00:37:08,630
debt lateral,
but,

806
00:37:08,820 --> 00:37:09,653
but how do you reign in spending,
because this seems to be the thing that 

807
00:37:11,310 --> 00:37:12,300
all the trump people,
right?

808
00:37:12,300 --> 00:37:13,133
They all thought he was going to reign 
in spending this on quite the opposite 

809
00:37:15,751 --> 00:37:16,511
pack.
And,

810
00:37:16,511 --> 00:37:17,190
and it's,
it's,

811
00:37:17,190 --> 00:37:18,900
I think it's more than ever before.
It is.

812
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:21,970
It is.
So I think the big question,

813
00:37:22,020 --> 00:37:22,853
I don't know how to do it.
We can speculate about changing the 

814
00:37:25,771 --> 00:37:26,604
constitution,
put in constitutional balanced budget 

815
00:37:28,201 --> 00:37:30,660
amendments,
constitutional caps on spending.

816
00:37:30,840 --> 00:37:31,673
I'm skeptical of all of those things.
Government has many ways to get around 

817
00:37:34,150 --> 00:37:36,600
these,
these paper tiger provisions.

818
00:37:37,050 --> 00:37:37,883
Uh,
the problem is the problem is Americans 

819
00:37:40,741 --> 00:37:42,810
today look to government and they,
and they,

820
00:37:42,870 --> 00:37:46,440
they basically,
you're spending other people's money and

821
00:37:46,441 --> 00:37:47,760
so if you're spending other people's 
money,

822
00:37:47,761 --> 00:37:49,260
it's easy to spend.
My,

823
00:37:49,350 --> 00:37:50,183
my former colleague,
Russ Roberts had a piece in the Wall 

824
00:37:52,290 --> 00:37:55,230
Street Journal many years ago entitled 
something like if you were paying,

825
00:37:55,231 --> 00:37:56,550
I'm having steak.
So imagine,

826
00:37:56,551 --> 00:37:57,384
you know,
imagine that we all go to a restaurant 

827
00:37:58,591 --> 00:38:00,030
and you know,
the different menu items,

828
00:38:00,031 --> 00:38:00,180
right?

829
00:38:00,180 --> 00:38:01,013
Well,
you can go to a restaurant and you and 

830
00:38:01,661 --> 00:38:03,510
you're picking up your part of the tab,
right,

831
00:38:03,511 --> 00:38:04,280
you,
you,

832
00:38:04,280 --> 00:38:05,113
you may order a steak,
but that's because it's worthwhile to 

833
00:38:06,490 --> 00:38:08,310
and you will have to pay for it.
Uh,

834
00:38:08,550 --> 00:38:09,383
but you might,
if you have to pay for you might not 

835
00:38:10,561 --> 00:38:11,680
already sick,
it might order a,

836
00:38:11,750 --> 00:38:14,180
a less expensive dish,
but if it's going to be even,

837
00:38:14,200 --> 00:38:15,033
it's just to be shared,
then based then the bulk of your extra 

838
00:38:19,170 --> 00:38:21,630
expenditure is shared with the people 
you're going to dinner with.

839
00:38:22,140 --> 00:38:23,790
And that's true for every person that,
that dinner.

840
00:38:23,820 --> 00:38:24,653
Right?
And so you wind up with this bizarre 

841
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:27,233
circumstance where every person acting 
rationally winds up ordering too much 

842
00:38:30,990 --> 00:38:33,570
winds up asking of the restaurant too 
much.

843
00:38:33,690 --> 00:38:37,660
We wind up asking if our too much,
but we have to pay for it.

844
00:38:38,170 --> 00:38:40,990
The resources do not fall out of the sky
free.

845
00:38:41,140 --> 00:38:42,660
They're coming from somewhere.
And,

846
00:38:42,840 --> 00:38:43,673
and because we're spending too much,
we're taking resources from where they 

847
00:38:46,061 --> 00:38:48,370
would be better used and putting them 
were really,

848
00:38:48,371 --> 00:38:51,520
none of us want them to be used,
but we all wind up using them there.

849
00:38:51,521 --> 00:38:55,840
I know you said before that an anecdotal
story is not proof of a bigger theory,

850
00:38:55,841 --> 00:38:57,280
but as you're saying that,
it reminded,

851
00:38:57,281 --> 00:38:59,800
I don't think I've ever said this 
publicly publicly before at my brother's

852
00:38:59,801 --> 00:39:03,040
Bachelor Party when I was a struggling 
comic and I had no money.

853
00:39:03,080 --> 00:39:04,990
You know,
I had maybe 50 bucks in my pocket.

854
00:39:04,991 --> 00:39:06,340
I don't know.
I was the best man.

855
00:39:06,341 --> 00:39:08,920
All his friends were in banking and 
lawyers and they all had money.

856
00:39:08,921 --> 00:39:09,754
Big rollers were at a fancy one.
The one fancy plays the Borgata in 

857
00:39:12,731 --> 00:39:13,564
Atlantic City,
the one fancy nice place in Atlantic 

858
00:39:16,390 --> 00:39:19,120
city.
And we're sitting around this huge table

859
00:39:19,300 --> 00:39:21,930
at a really super fancy restaurant and 
um,

860
00:39:21,970 --> 00:39:24,190
and all the entrees are 80,
9,000

861
00:39:24,200 --> 00:39:24,490
bucks.

862
00:39:24,490 --> 00:39:26,060
And I'm looking at him like,
you know,

863
00:39:26,680 --> 00:39:28,870
what am I going to do here?
I was going to get the chicken for maybe

864
00:39:28,871 --> 00:39:30,740
50 bucks or something.
And I was sitting with my,

865
00:39:30,890 --> 00:39:34,000
my brother's one friend who also was 
kind of struggling like I was.

866
00:39:34,540 --> 00:39:35,290
We're both saying,
all right,

867
00:39:35,290 --> 00:39:36,670
we're going to get the chicken for 50 
bucks.

868
00:39:36,671 --> 00:39:38,170
We go around,
everyone's getting steak,

869
00:39:38,171 --> 00:39:38,861
lobster,
steak,

870
00:39:38,861 --> 00:39:39,521
lobster,
steak,

871
00:39:39,521 --> 00:39:40,151
lobster,
steak,

872
00:39:40,151 --> 00:39:42,010
lobster.
It gets to my friend Josh.

873
00:39:42,011 --> 00:39:43,230
He,
he's the whole time he's gone.

874
00:39:43,240 --> 00:39:45,370
I'm getting the chicken.
The waitress says,

875
00:39:45,371 --> 00:39:46,061
what do you want?
He goes,

876
00:39:46,061 --> 00:39:48,370
lobster.
And then I just said steak like that,

877
00:39:48,371 --> 00:39:49,204
like,
and it's exactly what you're talking 

878
00:39:50,051 --> 00:39:50,884
about.
You suddenly lose concept of what's in 

879
00:39:53,171 --> 00:39:54,900
your pocket somehow.
It's gonna Happen,

880
00:39:54,901 --> 00:39:56,470
right?
It gets the bill's going to be shared.

881
00:39:56,560 --> 00:39:57,510
Then the,
the,

882
00:39:57,590 --> 00:39:58,423
the,
the additional cost to you of ordering 

883
00:39:59,891 --> 00:40:04,570
states adopt a tiny fraction of the 
actual additional cost to the steak.

884
00:40:04,570 --> 00:40:06,970
And that's the problem with,
with government today.

885
00:40:07,390 --> 00:40:08,223
We have people in Washington spending 
other people's money for the benefit of 

886
00:40:11,381 --> 00:40:14,620
yet other people.
And when you do that,

887
00:40:14,680 --> 00:40:16,420
you just get too much,
too much spending.

888
00:40:16,720 --> 00:40:17,440
Uh,
we,

889
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:19,070
we've,
I don't know a better way to say it,

890
00:40:19,071 --> 00:40:20,730
it doesn't sound very economic 
understand,

891
00:40:20,740 --> 00:40:21,573
but we've lost the ethic of respecting 
other people's property once government 

892
00:40:26,441 --> 00:40:27,274
gets money,
once government officials figure out 

893
00:40:30,310 --> 00:40:32,200
something that they fancy is,
is,

894
00:40:32,260 --> 00:40:34,720
is good,
and it may or may not really be good.

895
00:40:35,140 --> 00:40:35,973
Uh,
which doesn't mean necessarily it's 

896
00:40:36,701 --> 00:40:37,534
worthwhile,
but maybe a good project that doesn't 

897
00:40:39,521 --> 00:40:43,030
mean that therefore we should go ahead 
and spend money on it.

898
00:40:43,090 --> 00:40:43,923
Uh,
there's an insufficient connection 

899
00:40:45,821 --> 00:40:48,010
between the spending and the,
and the,

900
00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:51,700
and the experience of the cost of the 
resources that go into the spending.

901
00:40:51,970 --> 00:40:56,290
How much of this do you think is not an 
economic problem but a political problem

902
00:40:56,291 --> 00:40:59,860
so that if a politician was to get this 
right,

903
00:40:59,861 --> 00:41:00,694
let's say there's some magical 
politician out there who really 

904
00:41:02,501 --> 00:41:05,890
understands economics,
but he knows if he goes to the Senate.

905
00:41:05,890 --> 00:41:08,080
So I suspect rand Paul's kind of like 
this.

906
00:41:08,081 --> 00:41:13,081
I think he basically gets this and he 
does fight the best fight generally that

907
00:41:13,181 --> 00:41:16,660
I think he can,
but that they,

908
00:41:16,870 --> 00:41:19,090
these guys want to get reelected and 
saying to people,

909
00:41:19,091 --> 00:41:22,880
we're going to spend less on you even 
though you know it's.

910
00:41:22,900 --> 00:41:24,820
It's the best thing we can do for you.
Actually,

911
00:41:24,821 --> 00:41:25,654
it's going to free you up one day and 
it's not going to tank the economy and 

912
00:41:28,570 --> 00:41:31,420
make us slaves to a foreign nation and 
all that.

913
00:41:32,200 --> 00:41:35,720
It just doesn't work politically because
it's not the easy answer of people more.

914
00:41:35,790 --> 00:41:37,250
I think it's exactly right.
Let's face it.

915
00:41:37,251 --> 00:41:41,420
Each politician has a timeframe that 
extends to the next election.

916
00:41:41,540 --> 00:41:43,250
Right?
So in the case of members of the house,

917
00:41:43,251 --> 00:41:45,340
that's the only two years case of the 
president.

918
00:41:45,380 --> 00:41:47,270
That's four senators,
six,

919
00:41:47,271 --> 00:41:48,450
that's not a long time frame.

920
00:41:48,650 --> 00:41:49,483
Anything beyond that timeframe is 
irrelevant to that person politically 

921
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:57,230
today or to make it relevant.
That person has to have an ethic that is

922
00:41:57,231 --> 00:41:58,064
very rare and unusual among politicians 
and people with that ethic tend not to 

923
00:42:00,951 --> 00:42:02,450
be,
not to succeed in politics.

924
00:42:02,750 --> 00:42:05,750
Handful do manage to get in,
but very few.

925
00:42:05,870 --> 00:42:06,703
So you have people without that ethic 
and they're just looking towards the 

926
00:42:08,721 --> 00:42:10,130
next election,
which is at most,

927
00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:12,890
again,
only two years away for house member and

928
00:42:12,891 --> 00:42:15,080
so if the bill is coming due two and a 
half years from now,

929
00:42:15,710 --> 00:42:16,543
if the,
if whatever other costs are going to 

930
00:42:17,691 --> 00:42:18,860
happen,
two and a half years from now,

931
00:42:19,150 --> 00:42:20,010
uh,
or,

932
00:42:20,190 --> 00:42:21,850
or alternatively,
if,

933
00:42:22,010 --> 00:42:23,640
if taking some action that's only going 
to,

934
00:42:23,641 --> 00:42:24,890
it's going to have costs today,
but,

935
00:42:25,010 --> 00:42:28,400
but huge benefits,
no matter how huge two years from now,

936
00:42:28,401 --> 00:42:31,100
four years from now,
I'm not going to take it because it's,

937
00:42:31,640 --> 00:42:32,473
that will do nothing to get them past 
that next hurdle which is getting 

938
00:42:34,431 --> 00:42:35,570
elected reelected.

939
00:42:35,570 --> 00:42:39,470
So in a very depressing sense or in a 
sort of dystopian future sentence,

940
00:42:39,770 --> 00:42:40,603
are we in a certain way?
Are we on a pathway to destruction no 

941
00:42:43,221 --> 00:42:44,810
matter what?
If you think about it,

942
00:42:44,811 --> 00:42:47,480
I mean if you take that line of thinking
long enough,

943
00:42:47,481 --> 00:42:51,830
right?
So we have a sort of weak political crew

944
00:42:52,280 --> 00:42:56,930
dealing in ways that are the reverse of 
how economically we can be successful.

945
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:01,370
Pretty,
pretty much always going off the off the

946
00:43:01,371 --> 00:43:04,220
cliff.
So despite all that upset,

947
00:43:04,221 --> 00:43:08,720
I remain optimistic and I'm not,
I'm not sure why I feel the same way.

948
00:43:09,840 --> 00:43:11,190
I remain optimistic.
Um,

949
00:43:11,750 --> 00:43:12,583
we,
we still have a respect for private 

950
00:43:16,221 --> 00:43:17,054
property in the United States.
We were still a very entrepreneurial 

951
00:43:20,960 --> 00:43:22,550
culture.
Uh,

952
00:43:22,790 --> 00:43:27,790
uh,
we still hold politicians to.

953
00:43:27,890 --> 00:43:31,910
Some of this is less now,
but to some level of,

954
00:43:32,550 --> 00:43:36,200
of responsibility,
I say that,

955
00:43:36,201 --> 00:43:38,210
um,
my libertarian friends are going to get.

956
00:43:38,240 --> 00:43:42,050
We're saying I think there's something,
there's something there,

957
00:43:42,460 --> 00:43:45,680
a look with the political problem has 
always been there.

958
00:43:45,710 --> 00:43:49,940
I think the US Constitution in the past 
up until about eight years ago maybe did

959
00:43:49,941 --> 00:43:53,420
serve more as a constraint that has 
largely been shoved away.

960
00:43:54,530 --> 00:43:55,363
But by and large,
we've still prospered over the past 80 

961
00:43:58,251 --> 00:43:59,630
years,
uh,

962
00:43:59,930 --> 00:44:00,763
almost in spite of ourselves.
So this something is something in the 

963
00:44:03,981 --> 00:44:08,750
American mindset that something in our 
gumption,

964
00:44:09,510 --> 00:44:12,230
and I don't want to sound like a mobile 
Rah Rah,

965
00:44:12,770 --> 00:44:16,730
but there's something about this society
of ours that remains,

966
00:44:16,820 --> 00:44:21,710
remains relatively open,
remains relatively free property.

967
00:44:21,711 --> 00:44:24,350
Private property rights remain 
relatively secure.

968
00:44:24,560 --> 00:44:25,393
I think we still have something of a of 
a rule of law in in place and what I've 

969
00:44:31,050 --> 00:44:31,883
learned in the 40 or so years that I've 
been pondering these issues is that a 

970
00:44:36,061 --> 00:44:39,660
free society is far more robust than I 
once believed it to be,

971
00:44:39,810 --> 00:44:44,010
which is not to excuse or justify any of
the abuses that it takes,

972
00:44:44,280 --> 00:44:49,280
but it's really robust and I have no 
good sense of where the point is.

973
00:44:50,320 --> 00:44:52,170
I don't believe it's indestructable.
Yeah,

974
00:44:52,470 --> 00:44:53,303
but I have no good sense of where the 
point is where you hit that point and 

975
00:44:55,621 --> 00:44:57,690
suddenly things are destined to go into 
the,

976
00:44:57,900 --> 00:45:01,860
into the gutter.
We may be moving there now.

977
00:45:02,130 --> 00:45:02,963
I have a 21 year old son for his sake.
I certainly hope we're not close to 

978
00:45:06,781 --> 00:45:09,030
that,
but my gosh,

979
00:45:09,031 --> 00:45:09,864
if you look back to the 19 thirties,
I think things will even worse than 

980
00:45:12,900 --> 00:45:15,140
idealize governed.
You know,

981
00:45:15,150 --> 00:45:15,580
the,
the,

982
00:45:15,580 --> 00:45:19,950
the trend of government wise than they 
are today and yet we did pretty well.

983
00:45:20,440 --> 00:45:21,273
I'm glad that you just said idealize 
because one of the things that I focus 

984
00:45:23,610 --> 00:45:25,730
on here is talking about ideas for 
matter.

985
00:45:25,760 --> 00:45:27,920
That's,
that's the whole purpose of what I do.

986
00:45:28,130 --> 00:45:28,963
Do you think that these ideas related to
freedom and the individual and laissez 

987
00:45:34,341 --> 00:45:35,174
faire capitalism and all of the things 
that we've discussed here are taking 

988
00:45:37,821 --> 00:45:39,380
root again,
because that's how I started.

989
00:45:39,381 --> 00:45:43,200
You mentioned my interview with Thomas 
Soul right before we started and I sense

990
00:45:43,201 --> 00:45:43,971
it,
and again,

991
00:45:43,971 --> 00:45:44,804
this is.
I can only tell you what I'm personally 

992
00:45:46,460 --> 00:45:47,520
feeling and what,
what I.

993
00:45:47,550 --> 00:45:51,340
The feedback I get and all that,
but I said to Thomas or to Dr Saul,

994
00:45:51,350 --> 00:45:52,183
I said,
do you realize that the renaissance of 

995
00:45:54,531 --> 00:45:55,910
your work is having and I think he's 
Kinda,

996
00:45:55,970 --> 00:45:59,120
he's Kinda just over it personally.
I think he's proud of his work,

997
00:45:59,150 --> 00:45:59,960
but I,
they shouldn't be.

998
00:45:59,960 --> 00:46:01,070
Yeah.
And of course they shouldn't be,

999
00:46:01,071 --> 00:46:03,470
but I think just on a personal note,
he's kind of like,

1000
00:46:03,471 --> 00:46:05,120
yeah,
I've been doing this for a long time and

1001
00:46:05,150 --> 00:46:05,983
that's great,
but I really sense these things are 

1002
00:46:07,281 --> 00:46:08,114
taking root again,
even though the mainstream media won't 

1003
00:46:09,111 --> 00:46:09,944
let you really believe that and they 
still will always elevate the people 

1004
00:46:12,621 --> 00:46:13,454
that are pushing a lot of the more 
socialist stuff instead of some people 

1005
00:46:16,131 --> 00:46:16,790
with some.

1006
00:46:16,790 --> 00:46:17,623
So getting,
getting back to something we said 

1007
00:46:18,651 --> 00:46:19,484
earlier,
I think it took a lot of people by 

1008
00:46:20,661 --> 00:46:25,490
surprise in the late 19 seventies when 
the ideas for cutting marginal tax rates

1009
00:46:25,530 --> 00:46:27,890
directly deregulation,
uh,

1010
00:46:27,891 --> 00:46:29,180
uh,
took hold.

1011
00:46:29,570 --> 00:46:32,000
And I think that's because people like 
Milton Friedman,

1012
00:46:32,350 --> 00:46:33,130
uh,
my,

1013
00:46:33,130 --> 00:46:37,780
my late colleague James Buchanan had 
been working years earlier in helping to

1014
00:46:37,960 --> 00:46:42,070
hire years early attempt to make these 
ideas sound and,

1015
00:46:42,080 --> 00:46:44,420
and accepted.
And they were in place.

1016
00:46:44,660 --> 00:46:48,710
And when the crisis of the seventies hit
those ideas had an effect.

1017
00:46:49,110 --> 00:46:49,943
A No one knows the future.
The future is not destined to repeat 

1018
00:46:52,701 --> 00:46:53,534
itself in the way that it did then.
But there are a lot of really good 

1019
00:46:56,391 --> 00:46:58,190
people are you,
you're doing great work.

1020
00:46:58,600 --> 00:47:01,970
Uh,
there are a lot of really creative young

1021
00:47:01,971 --> 00:47:06,200
people today push refining these ideas,
polishing ideas,

1022
00:47:06,201 --> 00:47:11,100
presenting them to the general public in
new and more interesting ways and uh,

1023
00:47:11,120 --> 00:47:14,620
maybe it's a hope over experience.

1024
00:47:14,620 --> 00:47:17,930
Maybe that hope over,
I hope over reality.

1025
00:47:18,410 --> 00:47:22,790
But I actually believe that these ideas 
are strong.

1026
00:47:23,210 --> 00:47:28,210
I think they are appealing and there 
they are out there and well today in our

1027
00:47:30,400 --> 00:47:33,160
made 19,
May,

1028
00:47:33,160 --> 00:47:35,770
2018,
we can't see when they'll take root,

1029
00:47:35,771 --> 00:47:39,760
but I think that they will in fact 
protect us.

1030
00:47:40,480 --> 00:47:41,313
That's a.
So that is the optimist in you and I 

1031
00:47:42,491 --> 00:47:44,680
have that too because otherwise,
how could we do what we do?

1032
00:47:44,681 --> 00:47:45,350
Right?
I mean if,

1033
00:47:45,350 --> 00:47:46,183
if the answer,
if you would look to me 10 minutes ago 

1034
00:47:47,591 --> 00:47:48,041
and said,
yeah,

1035
00:47:48,041 --> 00:47:48,874
pretty much.
We got to go off the edge there then 

1036
00:47:51,940 --> 00:47:52,773
one,
then I would have had some of the booze 

1037
00:47:54,431 --> 00:47:57,100
you have about behind Mr.
let's just so drinking right now.

1038
00:47:57,280 --> 00:47:59,190
Just wait for Armageddon.
Yeah.

1039
00:47:59,200 --> 00:47:59,530
No,
I,

1040
00:47:59,530 --> 00:48:00,280
I,
I,

1041
00:48:00,280 --> 00:48:01,240
look,
I believe.

1042
00:48:01,270 --> 00:48:02,103
Here's something that I did not fully 
appreciate 20 years ago that I do 

1043
00:48:05,500 --> 00:48:06,333
appreciate it now.

1044
00:48:06,580 --> 00:48:09,730
Twenty years ago I was a more hard nosed
economist.

1045
00:48:09,760 --> 00:48:12,130
Now ideas are really irrelevant.
They don't matter that much.

1046
00:48:12,131 --> 00:48:12,911
It's,
it's,

1047
00:48:12,911 --> 00:48:15,400
you know,
you know the institutional constraints.

1048
00:48:15,401 --> 00:48:17,160
I do think institutional constraints 
matter.

1049
00:48:17,170 --> 00:48:22,170
They're important,
but I've come to see ideas as by far the

1050
00:48:22,361 --> 00:48:23,194
single most important constraint and 
fuel for a society largely affected by 

1051
00:48:29,890 --> 00:48:31,030
the work of Deirdre mccloskey.
For.

1052
00:48:31,050 --> 00:48:32,100
Thank you,
pat on.

1053
00:48:32,110 --> 00:48:34,010
It was one of my favorite shots that met
you.

1054
00:48:34,030 --> 00:48:37,540
Interviewed deirdre's work has 
influenced me greatly and her work.

1055
00:48:37,541 --> 00:48:38,374
She's not the only one,
but she's done more than any other 

1056
00:48:39,431 --> 00:48:40,264
modern economists to make the case for 
the role of ideas and I think she's 

1057
00:48:42,911 --> 00:48:44,590
correct.
She's correct in that.

1058
00:48:44,830 --> 00:48:47,560
So in that you must be incredibly 
helpful then because I mean,

1059
00:48:47,570 --> 00:48:51,730
I feel the idea revolution.
I'm on tour with Jordan Peterson now and

1060
00:48:51,731 --> 00:48:53,660
I keep going up there and saying there's
an,

1061
00:48:53,730 --> 00:48:55,630
there's the right kind of revolution 
happening.

1062
00:48:55,630 --> 00:48:57,280
We're not killing each other in streets 
yet.

1063
00:48:57,520 --> 00:49:00,040
And how does that get stopped by an idea
revolution?

1064
00:49:00,070 --> 00:49:02,860
Yeah.
And so at the beginning I mentioned that

1065
00:49:03,180 --> 00:49:04,013
I came to economics because I was 
impressed how economics explained 

1066
00:49:06,971 --> 00:49:09,160
they'll gasoline shortages in the 19 
seventies.

1067
00:49:09,490 --> 00:49:10,690
So I know if you remember a few years 
ago,

1068
00:49:10,691 --> 00:49:11,580
you know,
gasoline,

1069
00:49:11,890 --> 00:49:14,410
Obama was in office,
gasoline prices are rising,

1070
00:49:14,411 --> 00:49:17,380
people are complaining.
Here's the importance of idea ideas.

1071
00:49:17,500 --> 00:49:19,720
There were,
there were no serious calls,

1072
00:49:20,110 --> 00:49:20,943
even the in the Obama administration to 
go back to 1970 style price caps on an 

1073
00:49:26,560 --> 00:49:27,600
energy.
I took that as a,

1074
00:49:27,670 --> 00:49:28,503
as a,
as a good sign that's saying it won't 

1075
00:49:30,311 --> 00:49:31,144
happen in the future,
but I believe the reason that was the 

1076
00:49:33,791 --> 00:49:38,791
case is because the economists who ics,
Milton Friedman and among the others who

1077
00:49:39,071 --> 00:49:43,210
explain the devastating roles of price 
ceilings on energy,

1078
00:49:43,300 --> 00:49:44,680
those ideas was still around.

1079
00:49:44,680 --> 00:49:45,513
They was still out there,
still out there and they prevented 

1080
00:49:47,861 --> 00:49:52,450
anyone who would propose such policies 
seriously from being taken seriously.

1081
00:49:52,451 --> 00:49:53,284
And so that,
that notion of returning to the 

1082
00:49:55,901 --> 00:49:56,734
seventies style price caps just never 
got a hearing a few years ago when 

1083
00:50:00,220 --> 00:50:01,900
gasoline prices were high.
So that,

1084
00:50:01,901 --> 00:50:02,291
that,
that,

1085
00:50:02,291 --> 00:50:07,030
that that's one,
a data point that supports our optimism.

1086
00:50:07,031 --> 00:50:07,631
Yeah,
that,

1087
00:50:07,631 --> 00:50:08,411
that's great.
I mean,

1088
00:50:08,411 --> 00:50:08,920
I,
you know,

1089
00:50:08,920 --> 00:50:09,910
it's a long game,
right?

1090
00:50:09,930 --> 00:50:11,110
I mean that,
that's the point.

1091
00:50:11,170 --> 00:50:12,003
It is a long game.
I want to talk a little bit around 

1092
00:50:13,750 --> 00:50:15,820
regulation before,
before we wrap up,

1093
00:50:15,880 --> 00:50:17,770
I had a,
you may know him,

1094
00:50:17,771 --> 00:50:20,200
the biology professor,
Bret Weinstein,

1095
00:50:20,201 --> 00:50:22,180
who's been on the show and he said he's 
a friend of mine.

1096
00:50:22,540 --> 00:50:25,420
Uh,
he made an interesting comment to me the

1097
00:50:25,421 --> 00:50:26,700
other day.
I think maybe he tweeted it out and then

1098
00:50:26,710 --> 00:50:27,590
we discussed it a little bit

1099
00:50:27,980 --> 00:50:28,761
about,
well,

1100
00:50:28,761 --> 00:50:29,594
if you're,
if you're taking the true libertarian 

1101
00:50:31,101 --> 00:50:33,200
approach and you're against all 
regulation,

1102
00:50:33,440 --> 00:50:34,273
will,
are you saying that you want no 

1103
00:50:35,091 --> 00:50:37,850
regulation over the airlines for 
example?

1104
00:50:37,851 --> 00:50:40,640
They have any safety regulations or 
anything like that and what?

1105
00:50:40,760 --> 00:50:42,640
We didn't have a ton of time to get into
the conversation.

1106
00:50:42,650 --> 00:50:43,760
I said,
I said Brett,

1107
00:50:43,761 --> 00:50:46,010
very quickly,
what I would say is I think airlines are

1108
00:50:46,011 --> 00:50:46,844
in the business of getting people from 
one place to another and they do all 

1109
00:50:49,401 --> 00:50:50,234
their due diligence and if the idea of a
government bureaucrat coming in to make 

1110
00:50:53,271 --> 00:50:54,104
sure that this little thing is this way 
as if they have more knowledge about it 

1111
00:50:56,571 --> 00:50:58,820
than the airline people,
I find that to be pretty faulty,

1112
00:50:58,821 --> 00:50:59,654
but,
but we sort of left the conversation 

1113
00:51:00,651 --> 00:51:01,484
there.

1114
00:51:02,820 --> 00:51:03,653
What do you,
what is the right amount of regulation 

1115
00:51:04,681 --> 00:51:05,880
as a,
as a Libertarian,

1116
00:51:05,910 --> 00:51:06,743
oh,
I'm in favor of huge amounts of 

1117
00:51:07,861 --> 00:51:10,680
regulation and I'm not being facetious.
I love regulation.

1118
00:51:10,770 --> 00:51:13,950
I believe the best regulator really 
given this is the market.

1119
00:51:14,280 --> 00:51:15,113
It's a competitive market,
is consumers being able to spend their 

1120
00:51:16,741 --> 00:51:17,530
money,
uh,

1121
00:51:17,530 --> 00:51:19,860
as they choose and,
or not to spend it as they choose.

1122
00:51:19,861 --> 00:51:22,290
It's the freedom of different,
uh,

1123
00:51:22,740 --> 00:51:26,210
producers and entrepreneurs to enter 
markets or leave markets as they choose.

1124
00:51:26,240 --> 00:51:30,060
It's the competition among producers.
That's where real regulation comes from.

1125
00:51:30,090 --> 00:51:32,010
The market regulates activities.
You're,

1126
00:51:32,070 --> 00:51:35,430
you're right about the incidence of 
airlines.

1127
00:51:35,431 --> 00:51:36,600
For example.
Uh,

1128
00:51:36,750 --> 00:51:40,800
no one has a stronger incentive to make 
sure that a multimillion dollar piece of

1129
00:51:40,801 --> 00:51:43,140
machinery doesn't just willy nilly fall 
out of the sky,

1130
00:51:43,260 --> 00:51:46,050
then the owner of that multimillion 
dollar piece of machinery,

1131
00:51:46,051 --> 00:51:48,100
namely the airlines or the company that 
they're,

1132
00:51:48,230 --> 00:51:49,320
they're renting it from.

1133
00:51:49,530 --> 00:51:51,690
And so the competition among the 
airlines,

1134
00:51:52,240 --> 00:51:53,260
the,
the,

1135
00:51:53,290 --> 00:51:56,220
the need for them to protect their 
investments,

1136
00:51:56,610 --> 00:51:57,443
that is a tremendous source of 
regulation and it's a very nuanced 

1137
00:52:01,711 --> 00:52:04,530
source of regulation.
It gets it right and it's not subject to

1138
00:52:04,531 --> 00:52:06,870
political control or political 
manipulation.

1139
00:52:07,140 --> 00:52:11,580
So a government.
So government regulation is too often,

1140
00:52:12,050 --> 00:52:12,883
uh,
actually deregulation in the worst 

1141
00:52:14,641 --> 00:52:15,474
sense.
It's government relieving businesses 

1142
00:52:18,330 --> 00:52:19,163
have the need to be as responsive to 
consumers as they would otherwise need 

1143
00:52:21,901 --> 00:52:22,271
to be.
So we,

1144
00:52:22,271 --> 00:52:22,610
we,
we,

1145
00:52:22,610 --> 00:52:23,780
we call for example,
uh,

1146
00:52:23,990 --> 00:52:25,040
uh,
uh,

1147
00:52:25,380 --> 00:52:27,600
occupational licensing.
And that's a form of regulation.

1148
00:52:27,900 --> 00:52:29,380
Well,
no,

1149
00:52:29,490 --> 00:52:32,560
it's a form of deregulation,
deregulation.

1150
00:52:32,750 --> 00:52:35,220
It deregulates the,
uh,

1151
00:52:35,430 --> 00:52:36,263
existing producers in the market from 
having to be as responsive as they 

1152
00:52:39,361 --> 00:52:41,730
otherwise would to consumers.
So for example,

1153
00:52:41,731 --> 00:52:43,770
this would be like you have to have a 
license to cut hair,

1154
00:52:43,860 --> 00:52:45,170
California.
Yeah.

1155
00:52:45,240 --> 00:52:46,020
And so if,
if,

1156
00:52:46,020 --> 00:52:49,830
if I,
if I'm a hair braider or a barber a or,

1157
00:52:49,890 --> 00:52:52,760
or an electrician,
and if this,

1158
00:52:52,860 --> 00:52:56,940
if the government prevents people from 
entering in competition with me,

1159
00:52:57,330 --> 00:52:58,163
that makes my life easier.
I don't have to be as responsive to 

1160
00:53:00,211 --> 00:53:01,500
consumers.
I can charge higher prices,

1161
00:53:01,501 --> 00:53:04,950
I could supply a less high quality 
services.

1162
00:53:05,910 --> 00:53:10,230
And so I am deregulated in fact by that.
So called regulation.

1163
00:53:10,580 --> 00:53:13,580
Basically you would say it's the risk 
you have to take to be free,

1164
00:53:13,581 --> 00:53:14,990
right?
So that in other words,

1165
00:53:14,991 --> 00:53:17,780
that if you're an electrician and I have
somebody come into my kitchen,

1166
00:53:17,781 --> 00:53:19,940
we had a little light thing the other 
day now.

1167
00:53:19,970 --> 00:53:21,110
Yes.
The guy who was licensed,

1168
00:53:21,111 --> 00:53:21,944
I guess because it's got to be licensed,
but you're saying it's just the risk 

1169
00:53:24,021 --> 00:53:26,070
that you have to take.
He

1170
00:53:26,070 --> 00:53:28,530
doesn't want to come in here and burn my
house down,

1171
00:53:28,600 --> 00:53:30,840
nor do you want him to do it.
Right.

1172
00:53:32,720 --> 00:53:34,680
This is another unintended consequence 
of so,

1173
00:53:34,860 --> 00:53:38,910
so called government regulation in that 
if people come to depend on it too much,

1174
00:53:38,970 --> 00:53:42,060
they just assume whoever you call up,
call up and say,

1175
00:53:42,180 --> 00:53:42,671
you know,
I,

1176
00:53:42,671 --> 00:53:44,700
I need some electrical work done in my 
house.

1177
00:53:45,170 --> 00:53:46,003
Well,
we live in a state where electricians 

1178
00:53:47,241 --> 00:53:48,960
are regulated,
so this guy must be okay.

1179
00:53:49,310 --> 00:53:50,320
Um,
uh,

1180
00:53:50,490 --> 00:53:51,780
maybe,
maybe not,

1181
00:53:51,840 --> 00:53:54,990
but if you knew that was up to you to 
check,

1182
00:53:55,410 --> 00:53:56,243
first of all the market supplies,
all these wonderful ways of verifying a 

1183
00:54:00,540 --> 00:54:01,740
quality.
So if,

1184
00:54:01,830 --> 00:54:05,520
if anyone was free to practice being an 
electrician,

1185
00:54:05,870 --> 00:54:07,770
a,
you would have easy access.

1186
00:54:07,771 --> 00:54:08,604
You as a consumer,
we have easy access to various 

1187
00:54:10,390 --> 00:54:11,460
mechanisms to,
to,

1188
00:54:11,530 --> 00:54:12,150
to,
to,

1189
00:54:12,150 --> 00:54:16,730
to rank various electricians by how,
especially in a video and all the apps.

1190
00:54:16,750 --> 00:54:17,640
Yeah,
absolutely.

1191
00:54:17,641 --> 00:54:18,250
Yeah.
So it's,

1192
00:54:18,250 --> 00:54:18,830
it's,
it's,

1193
00:54:18,830 --> 00:54:19,663
it's a total myth to think that the 
government is more concerned about our 

1194
00:54:24,781 --> 00:54:25,614
welfare and our property.
Then we are who's more concerned about 

1195
00:54:29,041 --> 00:54:31,470
your house than you are,
who's more concerned about your personal

1196
00:54:31,471 --> 00:54:34,700
safety and health?
Then you are a.

1197
00:54:34,860 --> 00:54:35,693
The government might pretend that it's 
more concerned or that it's somehow has 

1198
00:54:38,760 --> 00:54:42,360
deeper insight to what is best for you,
but I don't buy it.

1199
00:54:42,660 --> 00:54:43,590
Uh,
I think,

1200
00:54:43,710 --> 00:54:45,190
I think young children,
uh,

1201
00:54:45,360 --> 00:54:46,193
they are,
they don't know their interest as well 

1202
00:54:48,601 --> 00:54:50,880
as their parents do,
but once you become an adult,

1203
00:54:51,090 --> 00:54:55,110
the presumption must be that each of us 
is an adult cares for and knows our best

1204
00:54:55,111 --> 00:54:55,944
interests much better than any third 
party does reminded of something else 

1205
00:54:58,051 --> 00:54:58,884
right now.
I think maybe I got too many of my old 

1206
00:55:00,031 --> 00:55:00,864
economic theories from the simpsons 
because do you remember that episode 

1207
00:55:03,791 --> 00:55:08,370
knew very early on with Mr Burns at the 
power plant and he's leaking,

1208
00:55:08,400 --> 00:55:09,233
you know,
nuclear waste into the river and they 

1209
00:55:10,801 --> 00:55:14,310
get a three eyed fish and the whole idea
being,

1210
00:55:14,311 --> 00:55:16,410
if you just let business do what it 
wants,

1211
00:55:16,411 --> 00:55:17,244
it's going to pollute the river and 
you're going to be eating three eyed 

1212
00:55:18,571 --> 00:55:19,140
fish.

1213
00:55:19,140 --> 00:55:21,810
But that's completely the reverse of 
everything you've said.

1214
00:55:22,060 --> 00:55:22,470
So.
So,

1215
00:55:22,470 --> 00:55:23,303
so what,
what an economist would say to that as 

1216
00:55:24,421 --> 00:55:24,721
well,
you know,

1217
00:55:24,721 --> 00:55:27,150
there are some areas where,
uh,

1218
00:55:27,151 --> 00:55:32,151
your actions as a private citizen spill 
over onto a innocent third party so they

1219
00:55:33,601 --> 00:55:34,434
have no input.
So reasonable people can disagree about 

1220
00:55:36,751 --> 00:55:39,930
the proper role of government in 
preventing pollution or,

1221
00:55:40,200 --> 00:55:43,980
or preventing third party effects.
But so much regulation has nothing to do

1222
00:55:43,981 --> 00:55:45,900
with third party effects.
It's simply to say,

1223
00:55:46,020 --> 00:55:48,340
you know,
if you want to get your hair braided a,

1224
00:55:48,360 --> 00:55:50,280
you have to go to one of these people 
that we approve,

1225
00:55:50,340 --> 00:55:52,560
you're not allowed to go to that person 
over there,

1226
00:55:52,770 --> 00:55:53,560
uh,
who,

1227
00:55:53,560 --> 00:55:55,140
who does not yet have our approval.
Well,

1228
00:55:55,150 --> 00:55:59,940
there's no third party effect here.
And a surprising amount of regulation is

1229
00:55:59,970 --> 00:56:01,510
of that sort.
Yeah.

1230
00:56:01,511 --> 00:56:02,344
I mean,
I remember when I bought this house and 

1231
00:56:03,031 --> 00:56:03,864
you have to have all the people come by 
and the inspectors and everything and 

1232
00:56:05,911 --> 00:56:09,360
they're looking for these little absurd 
things that I'm talking with the builder

1233
00:56:09,540 --> 00:56:10,260
about it,
well,

1234
00:56:10,260 --> 00:56:12,570
this has to be an inch this way over 
here and blah blah blah.

1235
00:56:12,570 --> 00:56:15,300
And it's like,
there was no answer for it.

1236
00:56:15,301 --> 00:56:16,330
I mean,
a couple of times I say,

1237
00:56:16,331 --> 00:56:20,750
well,
why is that regulation to regulate?

1238
00:56:20,780 --> 00:56:23,920
That's how it is.
Someone in Sacramento's said this is how

1239
00:56:23,921 --> 00:56:26,360
it should be,
and then that's how it is and everybody,

1240
00:56:26,400 --> 00:56:27,233
everybody.
So another problem with government 

1241
00:56:28,391 --> 00:56:29,224
regulation is that it's one size fits 
all and I don't care how smart you are 

1242
00:56:35,100 --> 00:56:36,200
or,
uh,

1243
00:56:36,330 --> 00:56:37,163
how,
how much experience you have in the 

1244
00:56:39,371 --> 00:56:42,530
past,
particularly in our highly dynamic,

1245
00:56:42,730 --> 00:56:45,220
in our highly dynamic economy.
Things are always changing.

1246
00:56:45,580 --> 00:56:48,700
Different people have different risk 
tolerances.

1247
00:56:49,090 --> 00:56:49,923
Um,
so one of my least favorite regulators 

1248
00:56:52,091 --> 00:56:53,780
is the FDA.
Uh,

1249
00:56:53,860 --> 00:56:56,170
there are very few third party effects 
with the FDA.

1250
00:56:56,171 --> 00:56:57,004
The FDA is a,
a drug regulation affects you and it 

1251
00:57:01,661 --> 00:57:04,810
prevents you in consultation.
If you choose with your doctor.

1252
00:57:04,811 --> 00:57:05,644
And most sensible people would consult 
with a physician from choosing what 

1253
00:57:08,771 --> 00:57:12,160
level of risks you are able to subject 
yourself to in order to relieve yourself

1254
00:57:12,161 --> 00:57:13,160
of pain or to,
to,

1255
00:57:13,200 --> 00:57:14,530
to fend off imminent death.

1256
00:57:15,070 --> 00:57:18,850
I don't believe that any bureaucrats 
business but yours.

1257
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:22,330
You may make a decision different than 
differently than I do,

1258
00:57:22,570 --> 00:57:24,700
but so what we all have different 
tastes.

1259
00:57:24,701 --> 00:57:26,160
We all have different preferences,
preferences,

1260
00:57:26,161 --> 00:57:26,994
we all have different tolerances.
I don't believe that it's the 

1261
00:57:28,361 --> 00:57:29,710
government's position to say,
no,

1262
00:57:29,711 --> 00:57:30,340
no,
no.

1263
00:57:30,340 --> 00:57:31,173
Your preference for risk is too great.
We're not going to let you take this 

1264
00:57:33,911 --> 00:57:37,330
experimental drug because we think it 
might hurt you.

1265
00:57:37,510 --> 00:57:40,870
I don't see that's the government's 
business at all at your business.

1266
00:57:41,020 --> 00:57:41,853
Right.
And you better get as educated as 

1267
00:57:43,211 --> 00:57:43,751
possible.
I mean,

1268
00:57:43,751 --> 00:57:45,570
this is where I would say it comes down 
to education and,

1269
00:57:45,571 --> 00:57:46,060
and,
and,

1270
00:57:46,060 --> 00:57:49,300
but,
but who has a better incentive to become

1271
00:57:49,301 --> 00:57:50,890
informed and educated on the matter then
you,

1272
00:57:50,891 --> 00:57:52,380
it's your life.
Yeah.

1273
00:57:52,480 --> 00:57:53,291
Right.
And,

1274
00:57:53,291 --> 00:57:54,250
uh,
uh,

1275
00:57:54,400 --> 00:57:54,821
uh,
yes,

1276
00:57:54,821 --> 00:57:55,780
you can tell stories.
Well,

1277
00:57:55,781 --> 00:57:57,010
you know,
maybe you won't,

1278
00:57:57,340 --> 00:57:58,660
but I can tell stories too.

1279
00:57:58,660 --> 00:57:59,493
Well,
how do you know that this bureaucrat 

1280
00:58:00,251 --> 00:58:01,084
over here is going to do as good a job?
I'm willing to bet that you are much 

1281
00:58:03,521 --> 00:58:05,410
less likely to,
to be,

1282
00:58:05,700 --> 00:58:06,533
uh,
uh,

1283
00:58:06,650 --> 00:58:10,430
a less careful.
Yeah.

1284
00:58:10,510 --> 00:58:13,240
With your life than this guy or gal is 
with your life.

1285
00:58:13,270 --> 00:58:14,021
Yeah.
All right.

1286
00:58:14,021 --> 00:58:14,854
So since you said it was a long game,
and I know how much high Eq has 

1287
00:58:16,721 --> 00:58:19,060
influenced you and you right at cafe 
[inaudible] dot com.

1288
00:58:19,930 --> 00:58:20,763
Let's do what are the ideas of how got,
I know we've actually explored a lot of 

1289
00:58:22,661 --> 00:58:24,550
them here,
but if there was something that,

1290
00:58:24,580 --> 00:58:25,413
uh,
I told you before that a lot of my 

1291
00:58:26,111 --> 00:58:27,040
audience,
they go out and they,

1292
00:58:27,370 --> 00:58:29,770
they get books after and they start 
reading on all of this.

1293
00:58:30,310 --> 00:58:33,550
What are some of the ideas of high that 
you'd like to impart?

1294
00:58:35,820 --> 00:58:40,820
That society is vastly more complex than
we understand it to be particularly a,

1295
00:58:42,990 --> 00:58:45,610
a market oriented global society?
You know,

1296
00:58:45,611 --> 00:58:48,220
we talk about it in vague terms about 
the labor market,

1297
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:50,680
the amount of trade,
you know,

1298
00:58:51,040 --> 00:58:53,920
the,
the GDP numbers,

1299
00:58:54,190 --> 00:58:59,190
all these terms and numbers mask,
enormous underlying complexities.

1300
00:59:00,790 --> 00:59:05,790
All the action that makes our society 
work is done at the local level.

1301
00:59:07,140 --> 00:59:07,721
Uh,
and that,

1302
00:59:07,721 --> 00:59:12,700
that's a core hierarchy and insight.
And if you start acting at this,

1303
00:59:12,950 --> 00:59:15,700
at the higher level,
the risk is that,

1304
00:59:15,730 --> 00:59:18,770
that you will stamp out,
you'll,

1305
00:59:19,030 --> 00:59:19,863
you'll see a stomp out,
you'll smother these individual 

1306
00:59:24,921 --> 00:59:27,500
adjustments.
At the local level that actually bob,

1307
00:59:27,560 --> 00:59:30,650
whose consequences bubble up to the top 
to make it all work.

1308
00:59:30,890 --> 00:59:33,870
There's a great hire he,
he's not the most quotable of,

1309
00:59:34,250 --> 00:59:36,590
of guys,
but there's a great hire quotation.

1310
00:59:36,591 --> 00:59:37,424
I'm not going to get it exactly right,
but it goes something like the curious 

1311
00:59:40,581 --> 00:59:43,860
task of the economist is to,
uh,

1312
00:59:44,130 --> 00:59:44,963
uh,
remind me again of how little they know 

1313
00:59:47,751 --> 00:59:51,170
about what they imagine they can create.

1314
00:59:51,230 --> 00:59:51,921
Right?
So,

1315
00:59:51,921 --> 00:59:52,754
you know,
we can imagine Bernie Sanders imagines 

1316
00:59:54,191 --> 00:59:55,024
he can create a world of everywhere.
Everybody gets paid at least $15 an 

1317
00:59:57,321 --> 00:59:59,930
hour.
The other people imagine they can create

1318
00:59:59,931 --> 01:00:04,931
a world in which in which no one is dies
because of a drug overdose.

1319
01:00:06,650 --> 01:00:07,400
Well,
well,

1320
01:00:07,400 --> 01:00:10,610
you can create that world.
It's far too complex and that's the,

1321
01:00:10,820 --> 01:00:13,430
that's the critical hierarchy.
And inside the world's really complex.

1322
01:00:13,431 --> 01:00:14,264
And therefore for truly complex,
we want to devolve decision making 

1323
01:00:15,891 --> 01:00:16,724
authority down to the lowest possible 
level and not have people who are 

1324
01:00:20,391 --> 01:00:22,710
slathered in Hubris,
uh,

1325
01:00:23,120 --> 01:00:23,953
uh,
making decisions for those of us on the 

1326
01:00:25,041 --> 01:00:26,690
ground.
On that note,

1327
01:00:26,691 --> 01:00:28,910
I think you're an excellent communicator
of those ideas.

1328
01:00:29,260 --> 01:00:30,470
That's what it's all about,
right,

1329
01:00:30,540 --> 01:00:35,420
and it's reciprocated that very much.
