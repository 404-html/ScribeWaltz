1
00:00:05,080 --> 00:00:08,620
I'm on a one day break from touring with
Jordan Peterson and joining me in studio

2
00:00:08,621 --> 00:00:09,454
today is a free speech lawyer and the 
director of the Individual Rights 

3
00:00:13,870 --> 00:00:16,870
Defense Program at the foundation for 
Individual Rights in education,

4
00:00:16,930 --> 00:00:19,750
Aka fire red called welcome to the Rubin
report.

5
00:00:19,930 --> 00:00:22,300
Thanks for having me.
That was a wordy interest right there.

6
00:00:22,420 --> 00:00:25,780
A lot of freedom stuff in there and that
that's all the stuff that I like.

7
00:00:25,781 --> 00:00:26,614
So I'm looking forward to this same.
So you guys fire as an organization is 

8
00:00:30,191 --> 00:00:34,540
one of the few bastions of sanity these 
days.

9
00:00:34,541 --> 00:00:35,374
Like when I see what you guys are 
tweeting about and consistently 

10
00:00:37,961 --> 00:00:41,710
defending the principles of free speech 
and free expression and open inquiry,

11
00:00:41,711 --> 00:00:42,900
I'm always like,
ah,

12
00:00:43,240 --> 00:00:44,073
there are some good guys left.
So first can you just tell me a little 

13
00:00:47,411 --> 00:00:51,080
bit about the organization,
why you guys got started and how you

14
00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:53,100
personally got involved?
Well,

15
00:00:53,101 --> 00:00:53,934
we got started in 1999 with a professor 
at Penn and a civil liberties lawyer in 

16
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:03,050
Philadelphia who were,
you know,

17
00:01:03,150 --> 00:01:05,420
they both decided that there were,
uh,

18
00:01:05,430 --> 00:01:08,490
there was a problem.
There was an epidemic at our colleges.

19
00:01:08,491 --> 00:01:12,220
And Universities of the core individual 
rights that,

20
00:01:12,330 --> 00:01:13,740
that make up,
you know,

21
00:01:13,741 --> 00:01:15,810
our,
our constitution,

22
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:16,840
if you will,
um,

23
00:01:16,860 --> 00:01:18,210
as individuals,
as people,

24
00:01:18,211 --> 00:01:20,620
as citizens of the United States,
uh,

25
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:23,940
Brent being respected on campuses across
the country

26
00:01:23,980 --> 00:01:25,930
back in [inaudible] 99.
Did nine.

27
00:01:26,110 --> 00:01:26,943
Yeah,
that's interesting because a lot of 

28
00:01:27,491 --> 00:01:30,010
people say this is just the totally 
recent phenomenon.

29
00:01:30,310 --> 00:01:30,661
I think,
uh,

30
00:01:30,661 --> 00:01:31,494
you know,
a lot of it that there is the political 

31
00:01:32,741 --> 00:01:34,720
correctness movement to the eighties and
nineties,

32
00:01:34,721 --> 00:01:35,410
a little bit,
you know,

33
00:01:35,410 --> 00:01:37,000
that might've had something to do with 
it,

34
00:01:37,001 --> 00:01:41,140
but this has been a problem since the 
free speech movement back at Berkeley.

35
00:01:41,141 --> 00:01:41,771
Uh,
you know,

36
00:01:41,771 --> 00:01:43,900
long before even the eighties or 
nineties,

37
00:01:43,901 --> 00:01:44,734
you know,
censorship is an age old problem that 

38
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:48,880
predates the United States of America.
Really.

39
00:01:49,270 --> 00:01:50,103
Uh,
and as Alan and harvey went about 

40
00:01:55,721 --> 00:02:00,250
creating fire and they decided to locate
it and like located in Philadelphia,

41
00:02:00,251 --> 00:02:01,084
which is the birthplace of our nation,
they really got an outpouring of people 

42
00:02:06,821 --> 00:02:07,301
saying,
Hey,

43
00:02:07,301 --> 00:02:08,920
this happened to me too.
Uh,

44
00:02:08,950 --> 00:02:09,880
and they said,
well,

45
00:02:09,881 --> 00:02:10,714
this is,
you know,

46
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:13,090
this is a problem.
This is an epidemic.

47
00:02:13,091 --> 00:02:15,830
We need to fix it and fire was born,
um,

48
00:02:15,831 --> 00:02:16,511
or,
or lit,

49
00:02:16,511 --> 00:02:18,610
if you will.
And uh,

50
00:02:18,670 --> 00:02:22,810
over the years getting close to 20 now,
crazy enough,

51
00:02:23,300 --> 00:02:24,133
uh,
that has actually just gone up every 

52
00:02:26,891 --> 00:02:30,170
year more and more people reach out to 
fire for help.

53
00:02:31,510 --> 00:02:32,343
When I got to fire for the second time,
I actually was a legal fellow with fire 

54
00:02:35,651 --> 00:02:39,280
after I graduated from law school before
I started in private practice,

55
00:02:39,610 --> 00:02:40,443
uh,
but when I came back in 2013 getting 

56
00:02:43,690 --> 00:02:46,340
several hundred case submissions a year,
um,

57
00:02:46,390 --> 00:02:50,410
and now we are getting damn near close 
to a thousand a year,

58
00:02:50,690 --> 00:02:51,523
a credible.
And that's just the stuff that we hear 

59
00:02:53,381 --> 00:02:54,214
about.
I can only imagine how much other stuff 

60
00:02:56,141 --> 00:02:56,974
is going on around the country for 
people who don't know that we're out 

61
00:02:58,691 --> 00:03:00,000
there to them,
uh,

62
00:03:00,050 --> 00:03:00,883
or you know,
people who perhaps go about it 

63
00:03:02,921 --> 00:03:04,130
themselves.
It's,

64
00:03:04,131 --> 00:03:06,130
it's crazy to think about how much is 
going on.

65
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:06,993
Yeah.
So I want to talk about some of those 

66
00:03:08,141 --> 00:03:10,750
cases and some of the specific work that
you're doing,

67
00:03:10,810 --> 00:03:13,810
but foundation for individual rights in 
education.

68
00:03:13,870 --> 00:03:14,703
I am a believer right now partly because
of Kanye West and because of a lot of 

69
00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:24,280
people online right now that the 
individual is making a comeback that the

70
00:03:24,281 --> 00:03:25,114
idea of the individual versus the 
collective is actually making a 

71
00:03:28,121 --> 00:03:28,930
comeback.

72
00:03:28,930 --> 00:03:29,763
Do you have any idea when they came up 
with a name for firewire was so 

73
00:03:32,291 --> 00:03:34,780
important to put the individual front 
and center?

74
00:03:36,100 --> 00:03:37,660
I think it's,
you know,

75
00:03:37,700 --> 00:03:38,533
and I'm speaking out of some level of 
ignorance because I haven't actually 

76
00:03:42,041 --> 00:03:44,680
discussed this with either of them 
personally,

77
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:47,440
but you know,
if I had to guess,

78
00:03:47,441 --> 00:03:51,460
it's because the individual qualities,
the freedom of conscious,

79
00:03:51,490 --> 00:03:56,490
the freedom of speech for things that 
allow us to participate in society.

80
00:03:57,820 --> 00:04:01,270
We don't get to the collective unless we
have the individuals.

81
00:04:01,330 --> 00:04:02,163
One is necessary to have the other 
because what is a collective other than 

82
00:04:05,410 --> 00:04:10,410
a group of individuals and consensus is 
a bunch of individual opinions.

83
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:11,553
That throughout the process of winnowing
and debating different good ideas and 

84
00:04:16,571 --> 00:04:18,760
bad ideas,
we reach a common understanding.

85
00:04:18,761 --> 00:04:20,950
We reach a a,
you know,

86
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:22,153
a norm for society and that's how.
That's why free speech particularly is 

87
00:04:25,731 --> 00:04:29,290
so important is because that's how we 
get to the optimal resolution,

88
00:04:29,291 --> 00:04:30,124
the optimal conclusions,
that's how we reach these communal 

89
00:04:33,521 --> 00:04:38,380
positions is only through our own 
personal expressions of what we believe,

90
00:04:38,381 --> 00:04:39,214
which exposes us to criticism or 
agreements or just flat out discussion 

91
00:04:42,551 --> 00:04:43,384
with other people.

92
00:04:43,420 --> 00:04:44,253
So how do you think the ideas of the 
collective took root so much a college 

93
00:04:47,891 --> 00:04:49,780
campus then?
Well,

94
00:04:49,900 --> 00:04:50,733
I think there's the given take in 
society at large that we really go 

95
00:04:55,571 --> 00:04:56,404
through every once in a while in terms 
of thinking about things as 

96
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:01,593
individualistic and then worrying about 
broader concerns of the community and 

97
00:05:05,681 --> 00:05:08,920
it's not altogether a bad thing and I 
think the college campus,

98
00:05:09,460 --> 00:05:10,293
and it's always been this way,
it's a microcosm of what we're 

99
00:05:12,491 --> 00:05:13,324
experiencing in the broader society and 
I think that's another reason why it's 

100
00:05:15,581 --> 00:05:19,900
so important to protect individual 
rights on college campuses because where

101
00:05:19,901 --> 00:05:20,734
they fall on college campuses,
they are almost certainly short to fall 

102
00:05:23,770 --> 00:05:25,740
in society writ large.
Yeah.

103
00:05:25,780 --> 00:05:26,613
So that actually we discussed this 
briefly right before the cameras turned 

104
00:05:28,751 --> 00:05:30,340
on.
That's my concern about this.

105
00:05:30,341 --> 00:05:31,510
When people say,
Oh,

106
00:05:31,511 --> 00:05:32,344
you know,
there isn't a free speech issue on 

107
00:05:33,851 --> 00:05:34,684
college campuses and even though I keep 
going to college campuses and it's very 

108
00:05:36,881 --> 00:05:38,890
clear to me that there is a free speech 
problem there,

109
00:05:39,310 --> 00:05:41,380
but it's not what's going to happen.

110
00:05:41,380 --> 00:05:43,690
It's not just the screaming kids right 
now.

111
00:05:43,691 --> 00:05:44,524
It's not that.
It's that these are the people that are 

112
00:05:47,231 --> 00:05:50,560
going to be in leader positions five,
10,

113
00:05:50,561 --> 00:05:53,740
15 years in the future and further than 
that obviously.

114
00:05:53,950 --> 00:05:54,783
And if those ideas take root because 
they were able to silence us once they 

115
00:05:59,981 --> 00:06:03,140
are the lawmakers,
once they're in charge of public policy,

116
00:06:03,141 --> 00:06:03,974
they're not going to be too kind to the 
people who they were silencing way back 

117
00:06:08,571 --> 00:06:09,404
when.
Right?

118
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:10,513
Yeah.
I mean that's really one of the key 

119
00:06:11,991 --> 00:06:14,720
problems and it's not even just if they 
get elected to power,

120
00:06:14,721 --> 00:06:16,240
even if they aren't elected,
uh,

121
00:06:16,340 --> 00:06:19,910
and they don't rise to power and they 
can impose these views on other people.

122
00:06:20,450 --> 00:06:21,283
These are future citizens,
even if they're not necessarily future 

123
00:06:24,711 --> 00:06:28,730
leaders.
And then discourse of the nation,

124
00:06:29,030 --> 00:06:29,863
if that is the,
the prevalent feeling in society is 

125
00:06:33,201 --> 00:06:38,000
going to suffer tremendously as a result
if even if they're not in Congress or in

126
00:06:38,001 --> 00:06:38,834
the state legislatures,
if 50 percent of the country's 

127
00:06:41,601 --> 00:06:45,080
population thinks that we shouldn't be 
talking about certain things,

128
00:06:45,081 --> 00:06:45,914
we're not going to talk about these 
things and it's going to be a societal 

129
00:06:49,321 --> 00:06:50,570
he imposed if nothing else.

130
00:06:50,570 --> 00:06:51,403
And I think that's incredibly damaging 
to just about every aspect of our life 

131
00:06:55,071 --> 00:06:56,390
is as a country.
Yeah.

132
00:06:56,391 --> 00:06:58,030
It's so interesting to me because I know
you,

133
00:06:58,250 --> 00:06:59,083
you read about this,
but I was at the University of New 

134
00:07:00,740 --> 00:07:02,740
Hampshire a couple of weeks ago and you 
know,

135
00:07:02,780 --> 00:07:03,613
first we were supposed to give a speech 
on campus then about two hours before 

136
00:07:06,861 --> 00:07:09,050
they announced that they couldn't secure
the room,

137
00:07:09,260 --> 00:07:11,060
that they felt there were too many 
threats.

138
00:07:11,330 --> 00:07:14,480
So they were about 200 or 250 people 
supposed to be in the room.

139
00:07:14,481 --> 00:07:19,481
They moved us to the hockey rink,
which seats 7,500

140
00:07:20,181 --> 00:07:21,920
people.
So I stood in front of,

141
00:07:21,921 --> 00:07:22,754
uh,
a little,

142
00:07:22,850 --> 00:07:23,683
you know,
backdrop and I talked to about 200 

143
00:07:25,491 --> 00:07:26,324
people.
It was about 150 people that were there 

144
00:07:27,381 --> 00:07:29,960
to listen and be respectful and all that
stuff.

145
00:07:29,961 --> 00:07:32,270
And then they were about probably about 
50 protesters roughly.

146
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:34,590
Those are the rough numbers,
um,

147
00:07:34,700 --> 00:07:35,533
but the desire just to shout down,
to use noisemakers to scream to chance 

148
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,040
like robots,
they love robotic chance.

149
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:45,290
All of these things.
And I kept saying to them,

150
00:07:45,291 --> 00:07:47,150
guys,
do you have any direct questions?

151
00:07:47,330 --> 00:07:48,163
Is there something that I've said that 
you disagree with or is there something 

152
00:07:50,661 --> 00:07:53,900
you directly like to ask me?
And time and time again,

153
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:55,033
the answer was no.
And I don't know how you break them out 

154
00:07:59,121 --> 00:08:02,150
of that other than keep having these 
conversations and hope that the refugees

155
00:08:02,151 --> 00:08:04,220
make it to us.
And that's a common problem.

156
00:08:04,221 --> 00:08:08,810
I think it really comes down to 
ideological purity that people are after

157
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:12,350
the idea that if I disagree with you on 
something,

158
00:08:12,530 --> 00:08:15,770
whether it's small or even fundamental,
if I disagree,

159
00:08:15,771 --> 00:08:16,604
I disagree with you on that one thing.
That means nothing that you have to say 

160
00:08:19,941 --> 00:08:24,941
could possibly be a value to me and that
is completely false.

161
00:08:25,410 --> 00:08:27,830
That you couldn't be farther from the 
truth.

162
00:08:27,860 --> 00:08:30,710
We can learn so much from the people we 
disagree with the most.

163
00:08:30,740 --> 00:08:33,770
Even if I disagreed with you on 
absolutely everything.

164
00:08:34,070 --> 00:08:34,903
It would still be incredibly valuable 
for me to talk to you if only because 

165
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:39,073
that helps me sharpen and really 
understand why I believe what I believe 

166
00:08:42,501 --> 00:08:43,334
in and people really discount the 
importance of understanding why you 

167
00:08:46,311 --> 00:08:47,144
believe something.
So the argument that I've been making 

168
00:08:48,681 --> 00:08:49,514
for awhile is that,
and I do think right now at least in 

169
00:08:51,651 --> 00:08:54,230
2018 and this is more of a problem on 
the left,

170
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:55,333
that they've owned the ideas and the 
narrative and the college campus 

171
00:08:58,201 --> 00:09:00,450
discussion and academia and media and 
all that.

172
00:09:00,451 --> 00:09:01,284
They've owned that for so long that the 
reason these kids end up be are these 

173
00:09:04,471 --> 00:09:08,910
students ended up being so hysterical is
because they never hear a counter ideas.

174
00:09:09,060 --> 00:09:09,893
So then you get a pretty moderate guy 
who's arguing about liberty and freedom 

175
00:09:13,261 --> 00:09:15,090
for everybody and live and let live.

176
00:09:15,420 --> 00:09:20,190
And that actually offends them.
Because they never hear anything outside

177
00:09:20,340 --> 00:09:22,980
of what they're being taught.
That goes to the academic part.

178
00:09:22,981 --> 00:09:24,180
I think mostly.
Well,

179
00:09:24,181 --> 00:09:28,650
I think we're doing a really crappy job 
of educating students before they get to

180
00:09:28,651 --> 00:09:33,150
college about why free speech and our 
other rights are important.

181
00:09:33,330 --> 00:09:38,330
Civics education is clearly in the 
toilet right now and it's bizarre to me.

182
00:09:39,031 --> 00:09:40,500
I grew up in Skokie,
Illinois.

183
00:09:40,740 --> 00:09:41,573
One of the sites,
one of the most famous free speech 

184
00:09:43,891 --> 00:09:44,870
cases,
you know,

185
00:09:44,910 --> 00:09:45,743
in recent history.
Can you lay it out for those that don't 

186
00:09:47,551 --> 00:09:49,470
know this story.
In the seventies,

187
00:09:49,471 --> 00:09:52,950
the American,
the American Socialist Party,

188
00:09:52,951 --> 00:09:55,710
that Nationalist Party,
the Illinois Nazis,

189
00:09:55,711 --> 00:09:58,830
if you'd asked the blues brothers wanted
to march through Skokie,

190
00:09:58,831 --> 00:09:59,664
Illinois,
which outside of New York had the 

191
00:10:00,691 --> 00:10:03,840
largest concentration of Holocaust 
survivors in the United States.

192
00:10:04,110 --> 00:10:04,943
Uh,
and skokie tried to stop them and they 

193
00:10:07,711 --> 00:10:11,640
sued with the aid of the American Civil 
Liberties Union of Illinois.

194
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:14,150
And it went to,
well,

195
00:10:14,151 --> 00:10:17,280
both the Supreme Court of Illinois and 
the Supreme Court in the United States.

196
00:10:17,540 --> 00:10:21,290
Um,
and the Nazis had the right to March and

197
00:10:21,390 --> 00:10:25,350
the courts held so and there were 
threats of violence.

198
00:10:25,351 --> 00:10:27,620
And disruption and all,
you know,

199
00:10:27,930 --> 00:10:31,860
people out crying as to how this could 
be allowed,

200
00:10:31,861 --> 00:10:32,694
but ultimately the Nazis had the first 
amendment right to march through skokie 

201
00:10:36,271 --> 00:10:39,810
and I grew up learning about that case 
from a very young age.

202
00:10:39,811 --> 00:10:40,644
I can't tell you how many times I saw 
the movie they made about it and it 

203
00:10:44,370 --> 00:10:45,203
really.
It got me thinking at a young age about 

204
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:49,860
why this is important,
how I think about it,

205
00:10:49,861 --> 00:10:52,710
and I can't tell you that as a young 
child,

206
00:10:52,711 --> 00:10:53,544
I completely agree that the Nazis should
have a right to march when I was that 

207
00:10:57,571 --> 00:10:58,404
young,
I part of me didn't grasp the 

208
00:11:00,001 --> 00:11:02,850
overarching fundamental importance of 
free speech,

209
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,100
but I was thinking about it.

210
00:11:04,100 --> 00:11:04,933
It was just.
And I got there and I get the feeling 

211
00:11:06,271 --> 00:11:07,104
that sometimes we're not doing enough to
make our students think about why it's 

212
00:11:10,861 --> 00:11:13,470
important.
It's such an important case and I'm glad

213
00:11:13,471 --> 00:11:16,350
you mentioned it because it goes really 
to the heart of this,

214
00:11:16,380 --> 00:11:19,710
that the people that lived in Skokie,
as you said,

215
00:11:19,711 --> 00:11:23,130
the second largest amount of Holocaust 
survivors in the country.

216
00:11:23,550 --> 00:11:26,460
These people literally survived a 
genocide.

217
00:11:26,490 --> 00:11:27,323
Probably virtually all of them lost,
some of them probably lost all of their 

218
00:11:30,691 --> 00:11:32,640
family members and friends and all of 
that.

219
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:34,073
And yet I would sit here at someone that
lost Holocaust survivors on both sides 

220
00:11:36,481 --> 00:11:39,030
of my family and tell you it was the 
right decision.

221
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:42,360
You can't let the Nazis are the white 
supremacists or whatever they are.

222
00:11:42,450 --> 00:11:44,430
You can't let them start ransacking 
property.

223
00:11:44,431 --> 00:11:46,620
You can't let them start killing people 
or harming people,

224
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:47,933
but letting,
letting them march at the exchange of 

225
00:11:50,061 --> 00:11:50,894
free speech and it's kind of Shitty,
but you got to defend when it's hard to 

226
00:11:53,591 --> 00:11:54,424
defend,
but you have to find it when it's hard 

227
00:11:55,601 --> 00:11:56,434
to defend because otherwise it's not 
going to be around to defend when it's 

228
00:11:59,820 --> 00:12:00,740
easy to defend.

229
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:01,953
You know,
once you start creating exceptions and 

230
00:12:04,660 --> 00:12:06,730
encroaching,
there's no end to it.

231
00:12:06,731 --> 00:12:07,564
And you know,
we've kind of seen even in other 

232
00:12:09,431 --> 00:12:10,710
countries,
uh,

233
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:15,190
that once the encroachments start,
it's always,

234
00:12:15,220 --> 00:12:17,980
well,
we make that exception and just this one

235
00:12:17,981 --> 00:12:18,814
other small exception.
And then there's inevitably another one 

236
00:12:21,071 --> 00:12:26,071
and another one and all for perhaps even
no good reasons in terms of,

237
00:12:27,130 --> 00:12:28,120
you know,
ideals.

238
00:12:28,121 --> 00:12:31,900
And the goals are laudable.
Perhaps I say it every show,

239
00:12:31,901 --> 00:12:35,650
the road to hell is paved with good 
intentions and getting tired and you and

240
00:12:35,651 --> 00:12:37,500
me both,
but you know,

241
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:40,780
it's really practically speaking,
it's inevitable.

242
00:12:40,950 --> 00:12:41,783
Yeah.
How much of this is just a confusion as 

243
00:12:45,791 --> 00:12:49,150
to what the First Amendment is.
That's also what I've started to realize

244
00:12:49,151 --> 00:12:49,984
because when I've gone on college 
campuses and the protesters are there 

245
00:12:51,911 --> 00:12:54,730
and I always say it,
I welcome peaceful protest.

246
00:12:54,731 --> 00:12:55,750
I completely welcome.

247
00:12:55,750 --> 00:12:58,330
I welcome the exchange of ideas.
The question is all of that,

248
00:12:58,720 --> 00:12:59,553
but when,
when they're screaming about certain 

249
00:13:00,461 --> 00:13:01,294
things,
I think there's just a disconnect as to 

250
00:13:02,831 --> 00:13:03,664
what I think to legal things.
I think what the First Amendment is and 

251
00:13:06,971 --> 00:13:10,690
what hate speech is,
is or isn't a.

252
00:13:10,691 --> 00:13:12,190
So can you talk about that a little bit?
I,

253
00:13:12,290 --> 00:13:13,123
I,
if I had to have to hear one more 

254
00:13:14,141 --> 00:13:16,150
person,
whether it be student,

255
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:17,233
uh,
Internet comment or to even journalists 

256
00:13:19,241 --> 00:13:22,450
are faculty members sometimes say hate 
speech is not free speech.

257
00:13:22,451 --> 00:13:23,350
I'm going to lose it.
Okay.

258
00:13:23,351 --> 00:13:24,184
So let's do,
let's do that one first because I 

259
00:13:25,300 --> 00:13:26,133
really,
I mean this will be maybe what we promo 

260
00:13:27,311 --> 00:13:28,144
for this episode,
but I really want people to understand 

261
00:13:29,561 --> 00:13:32,350
this.
Why is hate speech free speech?

262
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:34,640
Well,
on a legal level,

263
00:13:34,670 --> 00:13:38,950
hate speech is free speech because the 
First Amendment and the courts have said

264
00:13:38,951 --> 00:13:39,784
nothing about freeze or hate speech 
being unprotected by the first 

265
00:13:42,221 --> 00:13:42,580
amendment.

266
00:13:42,580 --> 00:13:43,413
Speech is protected by the First 
Amendment unless it falls under one of 

267
00:13:46,181 --> 00:13:49,630
the very few existing categories of 
unprotected speech.

268
00:13:49,650 --> 00:13:50,121
Yeah.
What are.

269
00:13:50,121 --> 00:13:50,954
What are those categories?
There's incitement to imminent lawless 

270
00:13:53,561 --> 00:13:56,260
action and these all have very high 
bars,

271
00:13:56,280 --> 00:13:58,210
right?
True threats and intimidation.

272
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:02,230
A,
you can be sued for libel or slander.

273
00:14:02,350 --> 00:14:03,460
Defamation is there.
No,

274
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:07,300
not some estates I think actually still 
have criminal statutes on the book,

275
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:10,480
but books,
but they're rarely enforced of fraud.

276
00:14:10,930 --> 00:14:11,763
Obscenity,
which people often confused with mere 

277
00:14:13,931 --> 00:14:14,764
profanity or lewdness,
but they are not the same thing by any 

278
00:14:16,901 --> 00:14:18,550
stretch of the imagination.
What?

279
00:14:18,570 --> 00:14:20,380
What's the difference on those two?
Well,

280
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:23,740
profanity and lewdness or are generally 
protected by the first amendment.

281
00:14:23,741 --> 00:14:24,574
Obscenity is a very high bar.
It's speech that has to be our 

282
00:14:29,351 --> 00:14:30,184
expression,
I shouldn't say more broadly than just 

283
00:14:31,931 --> 00:14:35,650
speech that has to appeal to the puriant
interest,

284
00:14:35,651 --> 00:14:38,200
which is an inordinate fascination with 
sex,

285
00:14:38,660 --> 00:14:39,493
describe or depict sex in a patently 
offensive way and have no social 

286
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:45,333
political,
literary or artistic value whatsoever 

287
00:14:47,861 --> 00:14:51,480
and to get down in the mud that.

288
00:14:52,340 --> 00:14:56,540
Had you ever heard of crushed videos?
I feel like I have,

289
00:14:56,541 --> 00:14:57,374
but I'm honestly not sure what that is.
They are videos of women wearing 

290
00:15:00,831 --> 00:15:05,831
stilettos crushing small animals like 
hamsters and Gerbils to death and people

291
00:15:06,501 --> 00:15:10,880
apparently get off on that.
I don't pretend to understand it.

292
00:15:12,230 --> 00:15:13,063
Even that is not wholly unprotected by 
the obscenity exception to the first 

293
00:15:18,771 --> 00:15:21,230
amendment that that's particularly 
interesting case.

294
00:15:21,231 --> 00:15:25,950
I suppose because the idea of it talking
about it seems like A.

295
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:26,793
I would have no problem with that,
but the action itself probably there's 

296
00:15:29,031 --> 00:15:30,230
some legal reasons,
right?

297
00:15:30,231 --> 00:15:31,610
Like killing it,
killing animals.

298
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:33,880
There's some law I guess if trolley 
state laws,

299
00:15:34,430 --> 00:15:38,450
but if you have this pornography you can
call it that.

300
00:15:38,451 --> 00:15:40,140
I just,
I have a hard time getting it.

301
00:15:42,110 --> 00:15:47,110
If you have it in you to possess it or 
you can't be prosecuted for,

302
00:15:47,220 --> 00:15:50,510
for possessing that obscene material,
it's an interesting distinction that the

303
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:54,140
act is the crime or the act is what is 
illegal,

304
00:15:54,141 --> 00:15:54,974
not the depiction,
depiction or disseminating the 

305
00:15:57,741 --> 00:15:58,790
information or that sort of thing.

306
00:15:58,920 --> 00:16:00,440
Right?
A child pornography,

307
00:16:00,441 --> 00:16:02,840
obviously not protected by the first 
amendment,

308
00:16:04,010 --> 00:16:06,730
but there's.
Well,

309
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:09,650
there's the one additional wrinkle of 
the fighting words doctrine,

310
00:16:09,651 --> 00:16:13,730
although there's considerable doubt that
it remains a viable,

311
00:16:13,850 --> 00:16:14,683
a exception to the first amendment,
but it really gets brought up a lot in 

312
00:16:20,061 --> 00:16:24,320
the hate speech debate to the extent it 
still exists.

313
00:16:24,380 --> 00:16:25,213
It's limited to face to face 
interactions where say I say something 

314
00:16:28,671 --> 00:16:29,504
to you that is so insanely abusive that 
you are likely to punch me in the face 

315
00:16:34,821 --> 00:16:35,654
without thinking twice about it.
Instead of taking a deep breath and 

316
00:16:38,900 --> 00:16:43,900
either ignoring me or coming back at me 
and there's reasons why it's fallen into

317
00:16:44,481 --> 00:16:45,314
disuse and it's worthwhile to note that 
the Supreme Court has upheld a fighting 

318
00:16:48,801 --> 00:16:49,634
words,
convictions since the case in the 

319
00:16:51,321 --> 00:16:53,290
forties when it created the fighting 
words except for.

320
00:16:53,300 --> 00:16:56,060
It's interesting just how far it's 
fallen into disuse.

321
00:16:57,050 --> 00:17:00,290
It incentivizes punching people in the 
face.

322
00:17:00,650 --> 00:17:01,483
It creates an easy way to sensor the 
people that you disagree with and it 

323
00:17:05,121 --> 00:17:05,954
would,
I assume be some level of a subjective 

324
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:09,193
piece of information as to what you 
think is offensive at the highest order 

325
00:17:12,771 --> 00:17:15,800
is different perhaps than what I think 
exactly what some of these other people.

326
00:17:15,810 --> 00:17:16,410
Yeah,
it it.

327
00:17:16,410 --> 00:17:17,243
It creates terrible incentives and it 
would basically lead to an 

328
00:17:19,641 --> 00:17:23,300
institutionalized heckler's veto,
so it's really not tenable.

329
00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:24,171
Yeah,
so on the,

330
00:17:24,171 --> 00:17:25,004
on the hate speech front,
which was clear what the Supreme Court 

331
00:17:27,531 --> 00:17:29,840
has said about hate speech,
you're allowed to do it with,

332
00:17:29,930 --> 00:17:31,760
with these exceptions that you've just 
laid out,

333
00:17:31,761 --> 00:17:33,240
you're allowed to see me and things.
What I.

334
00:17:33,260 --> 00:17:37,220
What I'm realizing on college campuses 
is they really don't like that.

335
00:17:37,250 --> 00:17:39,110
The people that set of people that we're
talking about,

336
00:17:39,111 --> 00:17:40,220
they really don't like that.

337
00:17:40,220 --> 00:17:41,053
So like they think if you like you,
it's just the fact you are allowed to 

338
00:17:45,201 --> 00:17:46,730
say bad things.
You can say,

339
00:17:46,731 --> 00:17:48,380
I hate all the Jews.
You can say,

340
00:17:48,381 --> 00:17:50,820
I hate all the black people and all the 
gays or whatever.

341
00:17:50,821 --> 00:17:54,420
You can say it.
You can't cause direct call to violence,

342
00:17:54,421 --> 00:17:58,470
but what I think they think is that if 
you keep saying those things,

343
00:17:58,471 --> 00:18:01,080
I hate these people,
that it's going to incite violence.

344
00:18:01,081 --> 00:18:02,730
Now my counter argument would be,
no,

345
00:18:02,731 --> 00:18:06,210
you have to use free speech to counter 
those bad ideas.

346
00:18:06,211 --> 00:18:09,390
That's the whole purpose of free speech.
But do you see that,

347
00:18:09,391 --> 00:18:10,224
that,
that seems to be the slope that they 

348
00:18:11,161 --> 00:18:14,040
consistently are on,
that if we allow you to say,

349
00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:15,480
I,
I hate these people,

350
00:18:15,481 --> 00:18:17,730
which is bigoted and prejudice and all 
those things,

351
00:18:17,731 --> 00:18:20,610
but it's afforded to us by the bill of 
rights.

352
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,130
They think that that's going to get you 
to violence.

353
00:18:23,131 --> 00:18:27,120
How do you combat that notion if you 
agree with the premise that is something

354
00:18:27,121 --> 00:18:29,780
that we tend to hear a lot in the first 
amendment world.

355
00:18:29,820 --> 00:18:31,590
Um,
and you know,

356
00:18:31,591 --> 00:18:34,650
first of all,
generally speaking in this country,

357
00:18:34,651 --> 00:18:37,530
we punish the people who do the bad 
acts.

358
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:38,513
If I watch your show and I get some 
cookie idea and go off and commit some 

359
00:18:43,441 --> 00:18:44,274
crime,
we're not going to throw you in jail 

360
00:18:45,811 --> 00:18:46,644
because I'm an idiot and took a terrible
idea that you didn't even intend me to 

361
00:18:50,311 --> 00:18:51,410
take right now.
That might be.

362
00:18:51,450 --> 00:18:52,283
It might be different though if I was up
here saying you should violently attack 

363
00:18:54,661 --> 00:18:55,630
these people,
etc.

364
00:18:55,660 --> 00:18:56,130
Etc.
Right.

365
00:18:56,130 --> 00:18:58,590
Exactly.
That's why the incitement standard is so

366
00:18:58,591 --> 00:18:59,250
high.
Yes.

367
00:18:59,250 --> 00:19:04,250
To be likely to insight and intended to 
incite immediate cRiminal action.

368
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:07,560
So if I tell you,
hey,

369
00:19:07,561 --> 00:19:09,420
you know,
it'd be fun to burn down a building,

370
00:19:09,421 --> 00:19:10,680
but you're not likely to do it.

371
00:19:11,300 --> 00:19:12,133
You're going to take it as a joke.
I probably haven't committed any kind 

372
00:19:15,601 --> 00:19:16,180
of,
uh,

373
00:19:16,180 --> 00:19:17,013
you know,
I'm awful expression if I know you're a 

374
00:19:18,811 --> 00:19:20,740
pyromaniac and I say,
hey dave,

375
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:22,330
let's go burn down a building.
Uh,

376
00:19:22,340 --> 00:19:25,200
I might find mysElf in a very different 
situation.

377
00:19:25,201 --> 00:19:27,240
I sort of left that phase at about eight
years old.

378
00:19:28,770 --> 00:19:30,000
But,
you know,

379
00:19:30,150 --> 00:19:34,860
I think that if you take a look,
one of my colleagues actually wrote up a

380
00:19:34,861 --> 00:19:35,694
piece for quill at a not so long ago 
about the rwandan genocide and looking 

381
00:19:40,411 --> 00:19:41,244
over the claims that the radio 
broadcasts actually caused more 

382
00:19:45,661 --> 00:19:46,494
violence.
And what it turns out is that the radio 

383
00:19:49,351 --> 00:19:50,184
broadcasts first of all,
only incited people who were already 

384
00:19:56,430 --> 00:20:01,430
predisposed and whoever you felt that 
way and it made it marginally easier for

385
00:20:01,741 --> 00:20:06,660
them to find people and you know,
be taught how to do certain things,

386
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:08,273
but it was relatively ineffective as it 
turns out in convincing people who 

387
00:20:14,310 --> 00:20:19,310
weren't already in a murderous rage to 
go out and commit violence.

388
00:20:19,430 --> 00:20:20,310
Uh,
and so,

389
00:20:20,311 --> 00:20:21,144
you know,
I think that the fear that allowing 

390
00:20:24,061 --> 00:20:27,350
these views to be aired is going to 
indisputable,

391
00:20:27,351 --> 00:20:31,620
he caused actual violence is somewhat 
overblown.

392
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:33,113
Now there's a second part to it,
which is that people expressing these 

393
00:20:36,331 --> 00:20:41,331
views might lead to more people adopting
those views and having prejudice view.

394
00:20:43,260 --> 00:20:45,600
Is that possible?
Absolutely.

395
00:20:45,630 --> 00:20:46,910
RighT.
So that's the part I was referenced,

396
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:47,753
but that's kinda the point is that we 
put those out there so we can fight 

397
00:20:52,271 --> 00:20:53,104
them.
If we don't have them in public and we 

398
00:20:56,021 --> 00:20:59,320
can't fight them,
they're still going to spread nothing.

399
00:20:59,380 --> 00:21:03,490
No idea ever went away because we said 
you can't say that.

400
00:21:03,820 --> 00:21:08,530
It just doesn't work like that.
How does the heckler's veto fit into all

401
00:21:08,531 --> 00:21:09,364
of this?
Because one of the things that I again 

402
00:21:11,050 --> 00:21:11,883
see on college campuses is when hecklers
starts screaming at you and then you 

403
00:21:15,431 --> 00:21:16,390
say,
just a second,

404
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:20,710
I'll get to your question or calm down,
or whatever you might say.

405
00:21:21,010 --> 00:21:22,420
I'm.
They'll say,

406
00:21:22,421 --> 00:21:23,254
well I have a right to free speech too.
They try to flip it on you to make you 

407
00:21:26,291 --> 00:21:29,980
look like a hypocrite.
That actually kinda kinda gets me,

408
00:21:29,981 --> 00:21:32,770
but I will give them a little bit of 
credit.

409
00:21:32,860 --> 00:21:33,693
I think You say a university event and 
somebody comes in and they chant for 30 

410
00:21:39,581 --> 00:21:44,581
seconds or they stand up and turn their 
backs and that's the extent of it.

411
00:21:45,040 --> 00:21:49,030
I Think that we should protect that 
technically.

412
00:21:49,031 --> 00:21:51,370
Are they causing a disruption?
Yes,

413
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:52,233
but it's minimal.
And it's actually maximized the amount 

414
00:21:55,151 --> 00:21:59,020
of free speech just to be some room for 
very minimal disruption,

415
00:21:59,350 --> 00:22:00,183
but when it gets to the point where they
are substantially interfering with the 

416
00:22:02,261 --> 00:22:04,720
speakers,
that ability to get their message across

417
00:22:04,721 --> 00:22:05,554
or the audience's ability to hear them 
through repeated shouting or noise 

418
00:22:09,171 --> 00:22:13,120
makers or standing in the front and 
blocking everyone's views,

419
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:14,800
uh,
and things like that.

420
00:22:15,370 --> 00:22:16,203
obviously that's a problem.
And last year we just saw a rash of a 

421
00:22:22,030 --> 00:22:22,863
heckler's vetoes going on and it kind of
all started with berkeley and milo 

422
00:22:25,781 --> 00:22:26,614
yiannopoulos when they protesters were 
successful in shutting down the event 

423
00:22:31,271 --> 00:22:32,104
through what had been before that been 
unfathomable on a college campus for an 

424
00:22:36,791 --> 00:22:37,624
invited speaker.
We've seen invited speaker controversy 

425
00:22:39,851 --> 00:22:40,684
since fire was founded.
Basically never ever am I aware of any 

426
00:22:45,911 --> 00:22:48,640
incident that came close to something 
like that.

427
00:22:48,970 --> 00:22:51,370
It was just madness.
Yeah.

428
00:22:51,490 --> 00:22:55,210
And they got away with it.
The so few arrests were made.

429
00:22:55,211 --> 00:23:00,211
And I can't help but wonder if the 
students out at middlebury college where

430
00:23:00,940 --> 00:23:01,773
Charles Murray was speaking,
sees done that and looked at the 

431
00:23:04,601 --> 00:23:06,190
berkeley students and said,
well,

432
00:23:06,580 --> 00:23:07,413
they were successful in stopping that 
event with speech that we also did 

433
00:23:10,301 --> 00:23:15,130
tested and they got away with it.
So let's try that.

434
00:23:15,131 --> 00:23:16,330
it's a viable tactic.

435
00:23:16,330 --> 00:23:18,940
This might be a solution for keepIng 
this speech.

436
00:23:18,941 --> 00:23:22,870
We disagree with off campus and ideas 
like that,

437
00:23:22,871 --> 00:23:27,871
that the tactics that students are able 
to successfully utilized,

438
00:23:28,030 --> 00:23:31,720
they will.
Behavior that is rewarded essentially is

439
00:23:31,721 --> 00:23:33,070
going to be repeated.
Yeah.

440
00:23:33,100 --> 00:23:35,080
And I see that all over the place right 
now.

441
00:23:35,081 --> 00:23:35,914
So for example,
just a couple of months after milo went 

442
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:41,020
to berkeley and that happened,
a ben shapiro spoke,

443
00:23:41,021 --> 00:23:46,021
they already was largely nonviolent,
but it cost the $600,000

444
00:23:48,620 --> 00:23:49,760
to make that happen.
I mean,

445
00:23:49,761 --> 00:23:52,580
I think an atm was broken in a couple of
windows and that's it.

446
00:23:52,940 --> 00:23:56,270
But that's part of the tactic is if we 
can keep ramping this up,

447
00:23:56,450 --> 00:23:58,940
we'll keep pushing the security costs 
and as I said,

448
00:23:58,941 --> 00:23:59,774
they had to move my event to a freaking 
hockey theater that a hockey arena that 

449
00:24:02,751 --> 00:24:04,820
couldn't have been cheap and and several
other.

450
00:24:04,860 --> 00:24:05,693
These I saw,
I'm sure you're familiar with the case 

451
00:24:06,801 --> 00:24:07,634
of lindsay shepherd up at wilfrid 
laurier from Canada and she just had to 

452
00:24:10,461 --> 00:24:14,510
crowdfund I think around six grand to 
get security for one of her events.

453
00:24:14,690 --> 00:24:17,030
So that almost seems like the new 
tactic.

454
00:24:17,031 --> 00:24:17,864
It's almost like we don't have to,
we can scare them with some threats of 

455
00:24:20,691 --> 00:24:21,524
violence and some other stuff and then 
will cause the security costs to be so 

456
00:24:24,231 --> 00:24:26,960
high that you guys will just give up.
Well,

457
00:24:26,961 --> 00:24:27,794
and that's another problem we've been 
fighting since even before all of this 

458
00:24:29,841 --> 00:24:30,674
came to a head is colleges and 
universities trying to charge student 

459
00:24:33,981 --> 00:24:34,814
groups security fees for the speakers 
based on the anticipated protest or 

460
00:24:38,661 --> 00:24:42,710
controversy.
And that's plainly unconstitutional.

461
00:24:42,711 --> 00:24:43,544
It has been for a long time since the 
supreme court said that a listener's 

462
00:24:47,181 --> 00:24:51,730
reaction is not a content neutral basis 
for regulation.

463
00:24:51,770 --> 00:24:56,770
You cannot charge more for controversial
speakers because they might drop protest

464
00:24:57,650 --> 00:25:01,940
that places have a price tag on 
expression and prices,

465
00:25:02,180 --> 00:25:03,013
like you said,
it will price the controversial 

466
00:25:04,461 --> 00:25:05,294
expression out of the marketplace.
They're not going to be able to afford 

467
00:25:07,221 --> 00:25:07,310
it.

468
00:25:07,310 --> 00:25:11,150
What student group has $17,000
to spend on security,

469
00:25:11,330 --> 00:25:12,163
none of them and you know what it comes 
down to is administrators at the 

470
00:25:16,641 --> 00:25:17,474
university itself has to be the 
guarantor of last resort when it comes 

471
00:25:20,211 --> 00:25:21,044
to speakers ability to speak and this is
the business they are in and sometimes 

472
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:32,000
it's unpleasant and sometimes it costs a
whole lot of money,

473
00:25:32,510 --> 00:25:33,343
but if you're not going to have a campus
where we can discuss things and we can 

474
00:25:37,821 --> 00:25:38,654
debate things,
even if it gets loud and boisterous and 

475
00:25:40,401 --> 00:25:41,234
raucous and contentious,
which is everything free speech should 

476
00:25:43,191 --> 00:25:46,670
be.
If your campus isn't going to be a place

477
00:25:46,671 --> 00:25:49,910
where that occurs,
then what are you?

478
00:25:50,570 --> 00:25:51,403
What are you doing?
So I do want to make a point of saying 

479
00:25:55,191 --> 00:25:56,024
that some of the campuses are getting it
right and I'm sure you know some of the 

480
00:25:58,161 --> 00:26:00,620
campuses that are doing a little better 
than some of the others.

481
00:26:01,070 --> 00:26:02,350
But for example,
uh,

482
00:26:02,420 --> 00:26:04,910
at the beginning of September,
2017,

483
00:26:04,911 --> 00:26:05,744
I spoke at claremont mckenna at,
they're doing a big free speech push 

484
00:26:09,081 --> 00:26:09,914
because of what happened the semester 
before with Heather Mcdonald and all 

485
00:26:12,561 --> 00:26:17,090
hell broke loose and on the campus and I
was completely welcomed there and they,

486
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:19,340
even some of the students who disagreed 
with me,

487
00:26:19,341 --> 00:26:22,070
I mean they asked me questions and all 
of that good stuff.

488
00:26:22,071 --> 00:26:22,904
So it's where I alwaYs think it's worth 
mentioning that some schools are doing 

489
00:26:25,971 --> 00:26:27,970
their best to manage some of this stuff.
Absolutely.

490
00:26:27,971 --> 00:26:29,090
And on two levels,
I think,

491
00:26:29,091 --> 00:26:29,811
you know,
first of all,

492
00:26:29,811 --> 00:26:31,700
fire rates,
policies at schools,

493
00:26:31,701 --> 00:26:35,660
we raised over 400 different colleges 
and universities on a red light,

494
00:26:35,661 --> 00:26:37,010
yellow light,
green light level,

495
00:26:37,030 --> 00:26:37,863
a red light being,
you have policies that are clearly in 

496
00:26:40,701 --> 00:26:43,920
substantially unconstitutional yellow 
light being.

497
00:26:43,921 --> 00:26:44,754
You have policies that are susceptible 
to being applied in bad ways and 

498
00:26:47,941 --> 00:26:48,774
greenlight schools where none of their 
policies poses a serious threat to free 

499
00:26:52,741 --> 00:26:54,630
speech in the past couple of years.

500
00:26:54,630 --> 00:26:58,410
The number of green light schools that 
we have has nearly doubled,

501
00:26:58,650 --> 00:27:00,630
which is tremendous.
Now,

502
00:27:00,650 --> 00:27:03,810
still close to 60 percent of schools 
have a yellow light,

503
00:27:03,811 --> 00:27:08,811
so there's work to be done.
But you combine that with the 38 schools

504
00:27:09,001 --> 00:27:09,834
that have now put out statements 
expressly committing themselves to free 

505
00:27:13,081 --> 00:27:14,190
speech.
Uh,

506
00:27:14,250 --> 00:27:15,210
something that,
you know,

507
00:27:15,211 --> 00:27:17,550
the university of chicago kicked off a 
while back.

508
00:27:18,120 --> 00:27:18,953
There's reasons to be hopeful and we 
work regularly with administrators who 

509
00:27:22,231 --> 00:27:26,370
are happy to have a consult on their 
policies and say,

510
00:27:26,420 --> 00:27:28,800
you know,
here are the changes we would make a.

511
00:27:28,801 --> 00:27:29,690
And,
and we're,

512
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:32,640
we have amicable relationships with so 
many administrators,

513
00:27:32,641 --> 00:27:36,390
which is really gratifying.
But on the student side also,

514
00:27:38,130 --> 00:27:38,963
part of it is overblown.
And I think by media there are a lot of 

515
00:27:41,851 --> 00:27:42,684
students out there who do get it and 
people have all ideologies and all 

516
00:27:47,461 --> 00:27:49,130
political,
you know,

517
00:27:49,650 --> 00:27:50,483
sides.
There are a lot of students out there 

518
00:27:52,441 --> 00:27:56,070
who get it.
I speak to them on a daily basis and I,

519
00:27:56,280 --> 00:28:01,280
there is a lot of reason to have hope.
This is not a lost cause.

520
00:28:01,560 --> 00:28:02,221
No,
I agree.

521
00:28:02,221 --> 00:28:05,490
I think it's important talking about it 
because even again at that university of

522
00:28:05,491 --> 00:28:06,324
New Hampshire,
think 75 percent of the crowd at least 

523
00:28:07,891 --> 00:28:10,560
was there respectfully decently to hear 
ideas and,

524
00:28:10,561 --> 00:28:14,310
and do that what I felt was important 
after and why I still want to talk about

525
00:28:14,311 --> 00:28:15,144
and have you here and all that is 
because I want people to be armed with 

526
00:28:17,461 --> 00:28:21,240
the right arguments so that when these 
set of people,

527
00:28:21,241 --> 00:28:23,820
even if it's just a smaller set that's 
just really loud.

528
00:28:23,821 --> 00:28:25,350
So as a disproportionate amount of 
influence,

529
00:28:25,500 --> 00:28:29,670
I want people to understand there are 
tactics you can use to fight it.

530
00:28:29,671 --> 00:28:30,504
So I'm curious on that list of 38 
schools that's kind of doing it right 

531
00:28:33,060 --> 00:28:35,460
right now when they've instituted some 
of these policies.

532
00:28:35,461 --> 00:28:38,010
And I remember when university of 
chicago did it about a year ago,

533
00:28:38,370 --> 00:28:39,203
um,
is there evidence that things actually 

534
00:28:41,611 --> 00:28:44,550
get better?
Because I'm going to guess that when you

535
00:28:44,551 --> 00:28:47,130
give some rules,
some of these students,

536
00:28:47,131 --> 00:28:50,010
they don't want to be kicked out of 
school and they might actually

537
00:28:50,490 --> 00:28:52,200
behave better.
Well,

538
00:28:52,201 --> 00:28:53,034
so I think you know this,
there's a lot of conversation right now 

539
00:28:56,191 --> 00:29:00,900
about some legislation even that's going
on about a disrupting speeches,

540
00:29:01,320 --> 00:29:04,800
mandatory punishments for students who 
do sell a certain number of times.

541
00:29:04,810 --> 00:29:05,643
and I think that's actually less 
important than I actually have somewhat 

542
00:29:09,721 --> 00:29:10,554
of a problem with the laws that create 
mandatory punishments for vaguely 

543
00:29:14,521 --> 00:29:17,010
defined terms like disrupt,
which,

544
00:29:17,090 --> 00:29:20,070
you know,
could be applied to pretty much anything

545
00:29:20,071 --> 00:29:21,750
that a sneeze,
you know,

546
00:29:22,260 --> 00:29:23,093
um,
but I think more important is when 

547
00:29:27,460 --> 00:29:29,880
administration is saying,
hey,

548
00:29:30,120 --> 00:29:30,953
these are the values that really,
that this is the wellspring of 

549
00:29:34,860 --> 00:29:38,470
intellectual vitality,
that our institution relies on a,

550
00:29:38,790 --> 00:29:39,623
these are the,
the ideals you should be paying 

551
00:29:40,810 --> 00:29:41,643
attention to.
This is what's going to make your 

552
00:29:42,761 --> 00:29:43,594
experience really worthwhile.
I think students will will listen to 

553
00:29:46,781 --> 00:29:47,614
that instead of maintaining the policies
that say thou shalt not say mean things 

554
00:29:50,891 --> 00:29:51,724
about your classmates that get students 
in a very different mindset when they 

555
00:29:56,051 --> 00:29:56,884
come to college.

556
00:29:57,100 --> 00:30:00,120
What are the statements are or what are 
the principles that you add?

557
00:30:00,150 --> 00:30:01,900
You guys want to see in those 
statements.

558
00:30:02,230 --> 00:30:05,980
The principles are largely,
this is a place of debate.

559
00:30:06,040 --> 00:30:08,560
This is a place of intellectual 
exploration.

560
00:30:08,770 --> 00:30:13,770
It is not our job as administrators or 
as faculty members to silence ideas that

561
00:30:15,251 --> 00:30:17,920
we find controversial or protect you 
from them.

562
00:30:18,370 --> 00:30:23,370
It is our job.
It is our mission to expose you to ideas

563
00:30:25,511 --> 00:30:26,344
that you might disagree with and give 
you the tools that you need to analyze 

564
00:30:29,681 --> 00:30:31,570
them,
think critically about them,

565
00:30:31,571 --> 00:30:32,404
formulate your own ideas and participate
in the conversation because that's what 

566
00:30:35,531 --> 00:30:36,364
you're going to have to do when you 
leave after four or however many years 

567
00:30:39,491 --> 00:30:43,240
you're here,
that's part of life and our democracy is

568
00:30:43,241 --> 00:30:45,370
participation.
If you don't participate,

569
00:30:45,670 --> 00:30:48,340
then you know as the saying goes,
if you don't participate,

570
00:30:48,341 --> 00:30:49,660
you have no grounds to complain.

571
00:30:50,980 --> 00:30:51,813
We have to really get students in the 
mindset that these are important life 

572
00:30:56,891 --> 00:31:01,150
skills and they're important to even in 
other instances in the workplace.

573
00:31:01,151 --> 00:31:05,320
That can be important if you have a 
policy position,

574
00:31:05,321 --> 00:31:08,890
If you're working at a company that you 
think is either bad or one that you want

575
00:31:08,891 --> 00:31:09,724
to promote,
you have to be able to think about the 

576
00:31:11,531 --> 00:31:15,610
people who disagree with you and what 
they're going to say,

577
00:31:15,611 --> 00:31:19,660
anticipate their response and formulate 
an argument that resolves it.

578
00:31:19,930 --> 00:31:20,763
You know,
there's countless situations in the 

579
00:31:22,331 --> 00:31:23,164
world,
outside of college were being able to 

580
00:31:24,970 --> 00:31:29,050
think critically is incredibly important
and really,

581
00:31:29,350 --> 00:31:30,183
uh,
I think that you get a lot of value out 

582
00:31:32,591 --> 00:31:33,424
of doing that outside of the classroom 
because it teaches you how to 

583
00:31:36,100 --> 00:31:39,160
contextualize the skill,
the teaches you how to apply it,

584
00:31:39,490 --> 00:31:42,790
not just in the,
I read this assignment,

585
00:31:42,791 --> 00:31:45,880
let's talk about it kind of way,
because that's really not how life works

586
00:31:45,881 --> 00:31:46,714
once you graduate.

587
00:31:47,110 --> 00:31:47,943
I wish it was.
It would make things a whole lot 

588
00:31:48,701 --> 00:31:51,260
simpler,
but you'd be out of a job probably.

589
00:31:51,460 --> 00:31:52,293
That's true.
I would have to find something else to 

590
00:31:53,561 --> 00:31:54,490
do.
All right,

591
00:31:54,491 --> 00:31:57,070
so we touched on the first amendment a 
little bit in the first half,

592
00:31:57,370 --> 00:31:58,203
but I think there's also just a 
fundamental misunderstanding about what 

593
00:32:00,791 --> 00:32:04,750
speech is related to the first amendment
in that the first amendment basically is

594
00:32:04,751 --> 00:32:05,584
about what the government is not allowed
to do and people have now extrapolated 

595
00:32:09,101 --> 00:32:11,890
that to think it means what everyone 
can't do.

596
00:32:11,980 --> 00:32:12,813
Can you talk to.
There's that famous xkcd comic about a 

597
00:32:16,210 --> 00:32:17,043
people have the right to tell you you're
an asshole on the internet and it 

598
00:32:18,490 --> 00:32:20,440
doesn't violate the first amendment.
and that's true.

599
00:32:20,500 --> 00:32:23,830
Although I see it all day long,
I get,

600
00:32:25,180 --> 00:32:26,013
I get that comic thrown at me sometimes 
even when it's a government institution 

601
00:32:28,781 --> 00:32:29,560
doIng the censorship.

602
00:32:29,560 --> 00:32:30,393
So it's,
it's overused a little bit too and that 

603
00:32:31,940 --> 00:32:36,940
kinda just gets in my craw a little bit,
but tHe first amendment really only Does

604
00:32:37,241 --> 00:32:40,850
protect you from the government and it 
doesn't just protect you from congress.

605
00:32:40,851 --> 00:32:41,684
It protects you from the states.
It protects you from the municipalities 

606
00:32:44,391 --> 00:32:45,224
that protects you from the public 
colleges and universities and their 

607
00:32:47,091 --> 00:32:48,300
administrators.
Uh,

608
00:32:48,680 --> 00:32:51,050
those are all state actors for the first
amendment,

609
00:32:51,620 --> 00:32:54,560
but it doesn't protect you against is 
your private employer,

610
00:32:55,280 --> 00:32:58,970
which means that I could well be fired 
for anything I say on this show today.

611
00:32:59,540 --> 00:33:02,490
See what I can do,
not to give you an ideas.

612
00:33:02,760 --> 00:33:03,770
Uh,
you know,

613
00:33:04,040 --> 00:33:08,960
your parents don't.
If you say I remember saying free speech

614
00:33:08,961 --> 00:33:11,720
to my parents and I was very young 
probably right after I read it about the

615
00:33:11,721 --> 00:33:14,570
skokie case and my mother giving me a 
side,

616
00:33:14,630 --> 00:33:18,290
either burn a hole through my skull at 
this point,

617
00:33:20,460 --> 00:33:21,293
but you know,
it only protects you against the 

618
00:33:22,281 --> 00:33:22,610
government.

619
00:33:22,610 --> 00:33:23,443
It doesn't protect you from criticism of
your peers and your contemporaries and 

620
00:33:26,301 --> 00:33:27,170
it shouldn't,
you know,

621
00:33:27,171 --> 00:33:31,970
that's kind of part and parcel of having
the public conversation is if you have a

622
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,130
bad idea and you're out there spouting 
it,

623
00:33:34,390 --> 00:33:38,840
we all have the right to tell you you 
got a shitty idea and we should say that

624
00:33:38,870 --> 00:33:39,703
because otherwise,
well we might see that shitty idea is 

625
00:33:42,971 --> 00:33:43,550
spreading.
And,

626
00:33:43,550 --> 00:33:47,210
and that's kind of the point of,
like we were talking aboUt earlier about

627
00:33:47,240 --> 00:33:48,073
letting these terrible ideas out there 
is so that we can stand up and defeat 

628
00:33:51,261 --> 00:33:52,094
them.
Yeah.

629
00:33:52,160 --> 00:33:52,993
Are you seeing any major threats right 
now from the government related to free 

630
00:33:57,381 --> 00:33:58,214
speech?
Because a lot of times I'll see people 

631
00:33:59,360 --> 00:33:59,751
saying,
well,

632
00:33:59,751 --> 00:34:02,870
trump Is attacking this or he texts 
journalism a lot now.

633
00:34:03,050 --> 00:34:05,990
it's no secret what my feeling about the
mainstream media is these days.

634
00:34:05,990 --> 00:34:06,823
I mean,
I think it's largely just partisan 

635
00:34:08,751 --> 00:34:09,584
garbage.
I don't think you should be killing 

636
00:34:11,241 --> 00:34:13,190
these people are harming these people in
any way.

637
00:34:13,191 --> 00:34:14,024
Just to be very clear.
I hope that by by mocking them and 

638
00:34:17,571 --> 00:34:18,404
exposing their nonsense will get a new 
generation of better journalists and 

639
00:34:21,141 --> 00:34:24,890
people who really live to the code of 
trying to find truth and all of that.

640
00:34:25,190 --> 00:34:28,520
But do you see a direct threat right now
coming from the government,

641
00:34:28,730 --> 00:34:31,940
either from trump or or elsewhere?
There's always indirect threat yet.

642
00:34:32,120 --> 00:34:33,260
I mean,
let's be clear.

643
00:34:33,890 --> 00:34:38,330
People in power will always,
if given the opportunity,

644
00:34:38,630 --> 00:34:39,463
silence their opponents,
they will preserve the status quo and 

645
00:34:41,601 --> 00:34:46,601
it's not just people in power.
It isn't entirely human reaction to want

646
00:34:47,720 --> 00:34:51,980
to censor the people we disagree with.
We think we have terrible ideas.

647
00:34:52,010 --> 00:34:55,640
That's kind of a baser instincts that we
all have now.

648
00:34:55,640 --> 00:34:58,290
We have to overcome that and understand 
the value of,

649
00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:00,270
of not doing that,
but it's.

650
00:35:00,271 --> 00:35:01,104
It's kind of understandable in a way and
that's why we have to be so vigilant in 

651
00:35:04,101 --> 00:35:08,240
protecting free speech because once the 
tools are there,

652
00:35:08,510 --> 00:35:09,343
they don't go away and we've seen this 
throughout history and their wield it 

653
00:35:12,771 --> 00:35:13,604
and people laughed at me when I was 
talking during the election cycle to I 

654
00:35:18,381 --> 00:35:20,930
guess kind of betrayed some of my 
personal political.

655
00:35:20,931 --> 00:35:22,010
Leif said,
you know,

656
00:35:22,011 --> 00:35:22,844
I was kind of talking about how the 
executive branch overreach as many 

657
00:35:26,721 --> 00:35:30,530
people did have the last administration 
was problematic because you know,

658
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:32,353
what about the next guy comes to power?
Maybe he's going to do something crazy 

659
00:35:34,701 --> 00:35:37,620
and nobody.
They all laughed at me.

660
00:35:37,650 --> 00:35:39,410
Hey,
I was talking about that.

661
00:35:39,610 --> 00:35:41,310
I was talking about it when bush was 
doing it,

662
00:35:41,311 --> 00:35:42,144
I was talking about it when obama was 
doing it and they laughed and then 

663
00:35:45,780 --> 00:35:50,580
donald j dot trump was elected president
and I looked at them and I said,

664
00:35:52,740 --> 00:35:53,573
what now?

665
00:35:53,670 --> 00:35:55,080
Uh,
and you know,

666
00:35:55,110 --> 00:35:55,890
you,
you said,

667
00:35:55,890 --> 00:35:57,810
oh,
it couldn't be possible that somebody we

668
00:35:57,811 --> 00:36:01,530
disagree with all that much who we think
is really terrible,

669
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:03,180
whatever,
get elected president.

670
00:36:03,240 --> 00:36:07,410
And when they started melting down over 
the election,

671
00:36:07,830 --> 00:36:08,663
I looked at them and I said,
told you so you can't be for if 

672
00:36:11,880 --> 00:36:14,070
executive actions when it's the guy you 
like,

673
00:36:14,071 --> 00:36:16,320
but then not for them when it's the guy 
you don't like,

674
00:36:16,321 --> 00:36:19,770
of course they're all going to do it if 
you give them the power to do it.

675
00:36:19,830 --> 00:36:21,600
And it's the same thing with free 
speech.

676
00:36:21,630 --> 00:36:26,630
and I think what's really important to 
remember is that those mechanisms,

677
00:36:27,421 --> 00:36:28,254
those tools with censorship are never 
ever going to redound to the benefit of 

678
00:36:33,690 --> 00:36:38,670
the marginalized communities that people
are oftentimes seeking to protect.

679
00:36:39,090 --> 00:36:43,560
It just doesn't happen.
The reason they are marginalized is that

680
00:36:43,561 --> 00:36:45,330
they don't have political power.

681
00:36:45,690 --> 00:36:46,523
They're not going to be the ones 
implementing these rules and that's 

682
00:36:49,590 --> 00:36:50,423
incredibly problematic and people don't 
understand that very practical reality 

683
00:36:54,750 --> 00:36:55,583
that those tools and censorship are 
going to be used to defend the status 

684
00:36:58,441 --> 00:37:00,390
quo,
which is what these people are trying to

685
00:37:00,391 --> 00:37:01,224
disrupt and disruption is kind of the 
just the major threat that everyone in 

686
00:37:06,541 --> 00:37:07,374
power feels and it we've seen it 
throughout history that they're in the 

687
00:37:11,731 --> 00:37:12,564
civil rights movement when protestors 
were arrested for sitting at lunch 

688
00:37:15,841 --> 00:37:18,900
counters or for engaging in nonviolent 
protests,

689
00:37:18,901 --> 00:37:23,130
but were arrested for disorderly conduct
because people reacted to their protests

690
00:37:23,131 --> 00:37:25,440
and violent ways because there were 
violent vicodin,

691
00:37:25,470 --> 00:37:30,470
thugs.
They were only exonerated Because of the

692
00:37:31,771 --> 00:37:32,604
first amendment and it took going to the
supreme court and it's really important 

693
00:37:35,971 --> 00:37:36,804
to remember,
I mean,

694
00:37:37,290 --> 00:37:38,123
how many lgbt artists and authors and 
publications faced censorship and had 

695
00:37:43,111 --> 00:37:43,944
their materials deemed obscenity at 
times and not even sent through the 

696
00:37:47,971 --> 00:37:48,960
mail,
you know,

697
00:37:48,961 --> 00:37:49,794
sometImes before and preventing them 
from integrating into the national 

698
00:37:55,351 --> 00:37:56,100
consciousness.

699
00:37:56,100 --> 00:37:56,933
I mean,
it's,

700
00:37:57,010 --> 00:37:58,910
it's really,
really important to.

701
00:37:58,920 --> 00:37:59,753
Yeah.
So is there something happening right 

702
00:38:01,861 --> 00:38:05,520
now via the government that you think 
shouldn't be happening?

703
00:38:06,900 --> 00:38:09,870
I get the broad sense sort of blue sky 
version of this that yes,

704
00:38:09,871 --> 00:38:10,704
people in power always are gonna want to
maintain power and do what they have to 

705
00:38:12,661 --> 00:38:14,760
do to silence people,
etc.

706
00:38:14,850 --> 00:38:17,250
But at the college and university level 
specifically,

707
00:38:17,251 --> 00:38:22,251
I think a lot of it is coming from the 
department of justice and the office for

708
00:38:24,091 --> 00:38:26,520
civil rights of the department of 
education.

709
00:38:26,550 --> 00:38:27,383
A few years back I had an agreement that
they called a blueprint for sexual 

710
00:38:31,981 --> 00:38:32,814
harassment policies at colleges and 
universities and it basically defines 

711
00:38:35,831 --> 00:38:39,520
sexual harassment is any unwelcome 
conduct of a sexual nature,

712
00:38:39,550 --> 00:38:40,383
including verbal conduct,
which we also know as speech and the 

713
00:38:47,470 --> 00:38:52,470
breathtaking broadness of that policy 
really kind of spread like wildfire.

714
00:38:54,790 --> 00:38:55,623
And you know,
these harassment policies have always 

715
00:38:57,640 --> 00:38:59,300
been problematic at times.

716
00:38:59,320 --> 00:39:01,090
This is directly tied to title nine,
right?

717
00:39:01,240 --> 00:39:03,250
Yes.
And you know it's,

718
00:39:03,370 --> 00:39:04,203
it's one of the.
I don't know if it's even an unintended 

719
00:39:06,791 --> 00:39:07,624
consequence.
It might be a very well unintended 

720
00:39:09,311 --> 00:39:12,220
consequence,
but you start seeing things.

721
00:39:12,221 --> 00:39:13,060
I,
for example,

722
00:39:13,070 --> 00:39:15,850
just the number of years back,
there was a student at the university of

723
00:39:15,880 --> 00:39:16,713
Oregon who was sitting on the ledge in a
dorm room window and she saw a couple 

724
00:39:21,671 --> 00:39:26,380
outside and as a joke she shouted,
I hit it first,

725
00:39:26,710 --> 00:39:27,543
which I didn't even know what that meant
when it first came into my head to look 

726
00:39:30,671 --> 00:39:33,060
it up and I realized that it was about 
ray j,

727
00:39:33,550 --> 00:39:34,383
uh,
having sex with kim kardashians and 

728
00:39:36,220 --> 00:39:37,053
kanye.
I guess that's the thing people care 

729
00:39:38,111 --> 00:39:39,200
about nowadays.
I don't know,

730
00:39:39,790 --> 00:39:40,250
man.
Yeah,

731
00:39:40,250 --> 00:39:43,600
he is the leader of speech movement.
Boy,

732
00:39:43,810 --> 00:39:47,620
maybe I do need to find another job,
but anyways,

733
00:39:47,950 --> 00:39:52,950
that the couple was offended and ran 
upstairs and talk to the ra.

734
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:53,793
And this student was hit with several 
disciplinary charges including sexual 

735
00:39:57,551 --> 00:40:00,970
harassment for just shouting.
I hit it first.

736
00:40:01,420 --> 00:40:06,420
And this is because of the latitude that
these laws gave colleges to.

737
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:07,960
Well,
once,

738
00:40:08,030 --> 00:40:09,640
you know,
department of education said,

739
00:40:09,641 --> 00:40:11,650
this is what we consider sexual 
harassment.

740
00:40:11,651 --> 00:40:12,484
Well,
no college in university administrator 

741
00:40:13,891 --> 00:40:15,460
in the right mind is going to look at 
that and say,

742
00:40:15,461 --> 00:40:16,600
oh,
we'll just ignore that.

743
00:40:16,750 --> 00:40:17,583
They're going to write new policies 
because they don't want huge 

744
00:40:18,881 --> 00:40:20,860
investigations that costs a lot of 
money,

745
00:40:20,861 --> 00:40:21,694
take a lot of time,
and have ultimately the potential to 

746
00:40:24,550 --> 00:40:27,910
cost the school all of its federal 
funding when it comes down to it.

747
00:40:28,270 --> 00:40:31,630
So we've seen the proliferation of these
really broad policies,

748
00:40:31,631 --> 00:40:35,260
some of which have hilarious lists of 
examples of things that could constitute

749
00:40:35,261 --> 00:40:39,280
sexual harassment,
like inappropriately directed laughter,

750
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:42,120
elevator eyes is another fire fame for 
it.

751
00:40:42,490 --> 00:40:43,323
These are all things that are known as 
flirting recording or whatever you call 

752
00:40:46,600 --> 00:40:48,050
it,
term,

753
00:40:48,070 --> 00:40:51,210
but like that's how you meet people and 
sometimes it,

754
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:52,390
it really is.
And,

755
00:40:52,391 --> 00:40:53,224
and,
and honestly it's the sexual harassment 

756
00:40:56,441 --> 00:40:57,274
angle has become a broader 
discriminatory harassment angle because 

757
00:41:00,071 --> 00:41:04,180
a lot of these policies start to look 
the same based on any protected class.

758
00:41:04,790 --> 00:41:08,020
And so when you say that,
you know,

759
00:41:08,021 --> 00:41:12,270
any unwelcome comments based on a 
protected class,

760
00:41:12,271 --> 00:41:12,780
uh,
you know,

761
00:41:12,780 --> 00:41:16,800
the not drawing from a particular policy
or anything is harassed.

762
00:41:16,801 --> 00:41:17,634
Discriminatory harassment.
Well that's a big problem because that 

763
00:41:21,820 --> 00:41:24,490
cuts off subjectively whichever way you 
go.

764
00:41:24,491 --> 00:41:26,170
Basically half of a,
a debate.

765
00:41:26,440 --> 00:41:27,640
People,
for instance,

766
00:41:27,641 --> 00:41:28,474
on different sides of affirmative action
are both going to find their opponents 

767
00:41:34,370 --> 00:41:38,210
ideology probably offensive.
Of course,

768
00:41:38,540 --> 00:41:41,750
if you are against affirmative action 
for whatever reason,

769
00:41:41,751 --> 00:41:46,040
you might be a people who support 
affirmative action,

770
00:41:46,041 --> 00:41:46,874
they're gonna say,
well,

771
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:47,833
that is discriminatory based on a 
protected class race and they shouldn't 

772
00:41:52,491 --> 00:41:53,324
be allowed to say that.

773
00:41:53,510 --> 00:41:57,830
We've seen students hosting events like 
affirmative action bake sales to kind of

774
00:41:57,831 --> 00:41:58,664
make a point about what they think is 
the unfairness and affirmative action 

775
00:42:03,560 --> 00:42:04,393
and administrators have tried to shut 
them down and sometimes succeeded and 

776
00:42:08,751 --> 00:42:09,584
shutting them down and I can give you 
countless examples of things just like 

777
00:42:14,781 --> 00:42:16,130
that,
but it's.

778
00:42:16,150 --> 00:42:16,983
It's dangerous because it kind of 
creates an orthodoxy of what we're 

779
00:42:19,941 --> 00:42:20,774
allowed to say,
what we're allowed to think and you 

780
00:42:22,710 --> 00:42:26,840
know,
there is no position in that.

781
00:42:26,841 --> 00:42:27,674
I can think of that I'm and I can say 
actually I think there is no position 

782
00:42:31,490 --> 00:42:32,323
that shouldn't be subject to challenge.
There is nothing that shouldn't be 

783
00:42:35,601 --> 00:42:36,434
susceptible to somebody disagreeing with
it in a public way and starting that 

784
00:42:41,181 --> 00:42:42,014
conversation.
Nobody has the right to declare this is 

785
00:42:46,131 --> 00:42:47,930
how it is.
That is,

786
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:52,850
I guess our collective to circle back to
the beginning.

787
00:42:53,490 --> 00:42:58,490
It's our collective right to participate
in that decision of what we believe.

788
00:42:59,511 --> 00:43:01,190
Yeah,
and that's why I have

789
00:43:01,480 --> 00:43:02,313
problem with this related to the way 
that the modern left fuels with these 

790
00:43:05,910 --> 00:43:08,010
things because if you're going to say,
all right,

791
00:43:08,011 --> 00:43:10,260
we're not going to draw cartoons about 
certain things.

792
00:43:10,261 --> 00:43:12,360
Now I'm not saying you should go out of 
your way to offend people,

793
00:43:12,660 --> 00:43:16,080
but once you say we're going to allow 
certain things not to be done,

794
00:43:16,320 --> 00:43:19,800
you've handed all of your faculty,
all of your power,

795
00:43:20,160 --> 00:43:23,730
all of your decision making capability 
over to a certain set of people.

796
00:43:23,731 --> 00:43:26,450
It doesn't matter what those,
what those people believe in or are.

797
00:43:26,640 --> 00:43:27,960
But then it's like,
well then they know,

798
00:43:27,961 --> 00:43:29,360
well,
we got them with something.

799
00:43:29,390 --> 00:43:32,070
We can just keep going and going and 
going and before you know it,

800
00:43:32,670 --> 00:43:35,520
you know it's too late to,
to fight back.

801
00:43:35,730 --> 00:43:37,970
I mean,
and again it's going to backfire.

802
00:43:38,170 --> 00:43:39,970
It's going to backfire against the 
people and,

803
00:43:39,971 --> 00:43:40,804
and I,
I think that you see it backfiring 

804
00:43:43,101 --> 00:43:47,060
sometimes.
You look at the faculty members recently

805
00:43:47,061 --> 00:43:47,894
who have been targeted by outrage mobs 
of people calling for their heads or 

806
00:43:50,751 --> 00:43:54,560
their jobs or sometimes both.
Sometimes when by the way,

807
00:43:54,620 --> 00:43:55,453
and my good friend bret weinstein,
it still does not have a job just 

808
00:43:58,701 --> 00:43:59,534
recently for more straightening example 
even is a fresno state random gerard 

809
00:44:04,460 --> 00:44:09,460
treated some intemperate and not 
particularly polite things about Barbara

810
00:44:10,070 --> 00:44:11,520
Bush right after she died.
Um,

811
00:44:11,960 --> 00:44:15,110
and you're being very kind and she can 
do whatever she wants.

812
00:44:15,111 --> 00:44:17,600
But yeah,
it was pretty nasty stuff.

813
00:44:17,630 --> 00:44:20,050
My mother told me never to speak ill of 
the dead sea.

814
00:44:20,320 --> 00:44:20,870
I,
it,

815
00:44:20,870 --> 00:44:23,390
I really know.
I mean you were being nice to,

816
00:44:23,420 --> 00:44:24,253
to what was tweeted feelings here and it
was the right that was calling for her 

817
00:44:30,411 --> 00:44:32,910
head and I mean,
one of my colleagues,

818
00:44:32,911 --> 00:44:33,770
I felt really bad.

819
00:44:33,830 --> 00:44:36,900
I was the one who helped write the 
letter,

820
00:44:36,901 --> 00:44:40,650
but he was the one who wrote our public 
facing blog post done on the website.

821
00:44:40,651 --> 00:44:41,484
He was getting hate mail and probably 
still is getting hate mail from people 

822
00:44:45,060 --> 00:44:46,770
saying,
how could you defend this woman?

823
00:44:46,771 --> 00:44:47,520
How could you.
I mean,

824
00:44:47,520 --> 00:44:51,480
it goes both ways.
Everyone's going to sense try and censor

825
00:44:51,481 --> 00:44:54,330
their opponent,
so just really be careful.

826
00:44:54,390 --> 00:44:55,081
Right.
Well,

827
00:44:55,081 --> 00:44:56,970
I'm glad you brought that one up.
So basically this,

828
00:44:56,971 --> 00:44:58,420
this woman who's,
she's a professor,

829
00:44:58,740 --> 00:45:02,640
she tweeted some really nasty stuff 
about Barbara Bush who had just died and

830
00:45:02,641 --> 00:45:03,780
by,
by every account,

831
00:45:03,781 --> 00:45:07,020
Barbara Bush was a totally decent woman,
but that's actually irrelevant for this.

832
00:45:07,350 --> 00:45:09,270
And yes.
Then the right started screaming and oh,

833
00:45:09,290 --> 00:45:10,680
she should be fired.
She should be fired.

834
00:45:10,681 --> 00:45:12,870
She was not fired.
The fresno state.

835
00:45:13,230 --> 00:45:14,770
She's still there.
Um,

836
00:45:15,390 --> 00:45:16,320
I thought,
wow,

837
00:45:16,380 --> 00:45:19,710
this is an exact example of how free 
speech is supposed to work.

838
00:45:20,070 --> 00:45:23,940
She said what she wanted people mocked 
her or supported her.

839
00:45:24,060 --> 00:45:26,400
The university decided to make a 
decision.

840
00:45:26,401 --> 00:45:28,860
Now it's interesting.
If the university had fired her,

841
00:45:29,070 --> 00:45:31,500
let's say they had said these ideas are 
beyond the pale.

842
00:45:31,501 --> 00:45:32,334
And then people started digging into 
some other things that she's said that 

843
00:45:34,351 --> 00:45:35,610
are,
that are pretty radical.

844
00:45:35,920 --> 00:45:38,760
If,
if that had happened where you guys have

845
00:45:38,761 --> 00:45:39,594
offered her defense because doesn't the 
university have the right to make the 

846
00:45:42,091 --> 00:45:42,924
decisions that it wants?
I don't know what their policies are on 

847
00:45:44,790 --> 00:45:45,630
tenure,
for example,

848
00:45:45,631 --> 00:45:46,464
or that sort of thing,
but don't they have the right to employ 

849
00:45:48,091 --> 00:45:49,980
people that they want to be employed or 
not?

850
00:45:50,400 --> 00:45:51,233
Not that I want to give that power to 
the mob because we know that the mob 

851
00:45:54,150 --> 00:45:54,983
does awful things.
It depends when the government as an 

852
00:45:57,181 --> 00:46:01,110
employer,
the government actually is restricted in

853
00:46:01,111 --> 00:46:02,070
what it can do.

854
00:46:02,120 --> 00:46:06,660
A for a,
an with respect respect to an employee's

855
00:46:06,840 --> 00:46:07,673
off duty speech when a,
and I think that's particularly 

856
00:46:11,641 --> 00:46:14,790
important with faculty members who are 
supposed to be public intellectuals.

857
00:46:14,791 --> 00:46:15,624
They're supposed to be out there kind of
discussing and debating this is what we 

858
00:46:19,141 --> 00:46:22,260
expect out of faculty members at 
colleges and universities,

859
00:46:22,590 --> 00:46:23,423
but when the government is the employer 
and the speeches made as a private 

860
00:46:26,791 --> 00:46:27,624
citizen on a matter of public concern is
this very clearly was then the 

861
00:46:31,561 --> 00:46:32,394
government has to make a pretty high 
showing that that speech so materially 

862
00:46:36,840 --> 00:46:41,840
interferes with the provision of 
services that the government is involved

863
00:46:42,031 --> 00:46:45,090
in,
that it warrants overcoming the employer

864
00:46:45,180 --> 00:46:47,340
employees first amendment rights.
Uh,

865
00:46:47,400 --> 00:46:48,233
and we actually wrote a long letter and 
lose co-sign sign by the aclu of 

866
00:46:51,721 --> 00:46:53,490
northern California,
uh,

867
00:46:53,740 --> 00:46:56,430
electronic frontier foundation and a 
whole bunch of other,

868
00:46:56,490 --> 00:46:57,323
uh,
organizations and on [inaudible] behalf 

869
00:47:00,271 --> 00:47:00,870
and sent it.

870
00:47:00,870 --> 00:47:04,070
And incidentally,
shortly after they got our letter,

871
00:47:04,110 --> 00:47:04,943
the university issued their statement 
that they weren't going to discipline 

872
00:47:07,891 --> 00:47:08,590
her.
Right?

873
00:47:08,590 --> 00:47:09,423
So,
so you are making the distinction in 

874
00:47:10,831 --> 00:47:14,010
this case that because this was not on 
campus,

875
00:47:14,011 --> 00:47:17,690
this wasn't being in a class taught in 
the class or,

876
00:47:17,691 --> 00:47:19,430
or brainwashing students in the 
classroom,

877
00:47:19,590 --> 00:47:22,590
that's different what she's doing on her
private side.

878
00:47:22,591 --> 00:47:24,450
And especially because as you said,
as a public intellectual,

879
00:47:24,451 --> 00:47:28,860
you're supposed to be talking about 
stuff that that's different than perhaps

880
00:47:28,861 --> 00:47:31,840
if she had said these very same things 
in class,

881
00:47:32,140 --> 00:47:32,973
they could have taken a different stance
that maybe would have had a little more 

882
00:47:35,470 --> 00:47:36,910
legal positioning.
Is that fair to say?

883
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:40,170
That's where it gets tricky because 
there's a circuit split.

884
00:47:40,430 --> 00:47:41,263
Get the supreme court back in 2006,
held that speech made pursuant to 

885
00:47:47,471 --> 00:47:48,304
official job duties is basically speech 
that's commissioned by the government 

886
00:47:52,001 --> 00:47:52,834
and therefore it does not have first 
amendment protection and you can be 

887
00:47:55,271 --> 00:47:56,104
fired for it,
but they did not decide whether or not 

888
00:48:01,450 --> 00:48:02,283
that would relate to speech that relates
to scholarship or teaching as a supreme 

889
00:48:06,071 --> 00:48:06,904
court put it,
which is due to the special concern 

890
00:48:09,911 --> 00:48:10,744
about academic freedom that we have for 
the reasons of faculty members being 

891
00:48:15,041 --> 00:48:16,270
public intellectuals.

892
00:48:17,140 --> 00:48:20,200
The fourth circuit and the ninth circuit
where California is.

893
00:48:20,201 --> 00:48:22,390
Have both said that no,
this ruling,

894
00:48:22,630 --> 00:48:23,463
that speech pursuant to official job 
duties does not apply at colleges and 

895
00:48:27,011 --> 00:48:30,580
universities to speech that relates to 
scholarship or teaching.

896
00:48:30,700 --> 00:48:34,210
So in California she could have been 
protected either way,

897
00:48:34,240 --> 00:48:36,400
but it's not that way all around the 
country.

898
00:48:36,401 --> 00:48:41,401
Some courts have declined to find that 
exception to the 2006 garcia ruling.

899
00:48:41,870 --> 00:48:45,190
Others have kind of ignored it for the 
time being.

900
00:48:45,191 --> 00:48:46,024
So one of these days the supreme court 
is probably going to have to make 

901
00:48:49,331 --> 00:48:51,160
another decision on that.
I'm curious.

902
00:48:51,161 --> 00:48:53,500
I know you guys are a nonpartisan 
organization,

903
00:48:53,530 --> 00:48:56,470
but if these decisions were left up to 
the states,

904
00:48:56,980 --> 00:48:59,800
do you guys have a position on that in 
and of itself?

905
00:48:59,801 --> 00:49:03,610
I'm sure you have a personal position,
but does fire have a position on that?

906
00:49:03,640 --> 00:49:04,680
I mean I,
I think our,

907
00:49:04,681 --> 00:49:05,514
our position is that the exception for 
scholarship or teaching absolutely 

908
00:49:09,191 --> 00:49:10,780
should be applied across the country.

909
00:49:11,050 --> 00:49:16,050
It's really fundamentally important for 
faculty members to be able to conduct,

910
00:49:18,010 --> 00:49:19,630
you know,
controversial,

911
00:49:19,631 --> 00:49:20,940
disruptive,
you know,

912
00:49:20,950 --> 00:49:25,950
as it relates to the status quo,
research and writing without fearing for

913
00:49:26,771 --> 00:49:30,610
their jobs because that's how we're 
going to get new ideas.

914
00:49:30,910 --> 00:49:33,880
If you just talk about things that 
aren't going to rock the boat,

915
00:49:33,881 --> 00:49:36,280
if you just researched things that 
aren't going to rock the boat,

916
00:49:36,520 --> 00:49:40,270
we're never going to get anywhere.
You need the bomb throwers.

917
00:49:40,850 --> 00:49:43,720
There's room for that.
So what about cases where,

918
00:49:43,721 --> 00:49:44,554
and I guess this brings up a little bit 
related to tenure because I think there 

919
00:49:46,961 --> 00:49:49,330
is something interesting because it's,
it's funny,

920
00:49:49,331 --> 00:49:50,164
I hear from professors,
I get a ton of email from professors 

921
00:49:52,630 --> 00:49:55,780
saying that they,
they love what we're doing here and that

922
00:49:55,781 --> 00:49:59,490
they're afraid sometimes tenured 
professors are still afraid of the mob,

923
00:49:59,500 --> 00:50:00,820
they know they're not going to get 
fired,

924
00:50:01,030 --> 00:50:02,080
but they'Re afraid of the mob.

925
00:50:02,830 --> 00:50:07,510
Is there an inherent problem in tenure 
in a way now because you could,

926
00:50:07,511 --> 00:50:10,510
if you have that protection,
and I'm all for saying whatever you want

927
00:50:10,511 --> 00:50:13,630
to say that technically if you were a 
history history professor,

928
00:50:13,631 --> 00:50:14,464
let's say you could start,
you could just start losing your mind 

929
00:50:17,171 --> 00:50:22,000
and teaching really dishonest,
complete reversal of the truth stuff.

930
00:50:22,450 --> 00:50:23,283
Um,
and have the protection of not being 

931
00:50:25,031 --> 00:50:28,860
fired like that actually handicaps the 
pursuit of knowledge from,

932
00:50:28,890 --> 00:50:30,140
from the university,
doesn't it?

933
00:50:30,320 --> 00:50:33,380
I'm not terribly concerned about that 
because generally speaking,

934
00:50:33,440 --> 00:50:38,440
there are ways for faculty to be 
disciplined or removed even with tenure.

935
00:50:40,430 --> 00:50:45,020
Oftentimes for gross professional 
competency issues.

936
00:50:45,050 --> 00:50:46,010
Um,
you know,

937
00:50:46,011 --> 00:50:46,844
if you are say teaching math and you're 
teaching students that two plus two is 

938
00:50:51,351 --> 00:50:56,300
17.
I think that the common core you can,

939
00:50:57,170 --> 00:50:58,003
there's ways that the university can 
address that and that's not really what 

940
00:51:03,201 --> 00:51:03,650
we're seeing.

941
00:51:03,650 --> 00:51:06,350
What we're seeing more often is a,
for instance,

942
00:51:06,351 --> 00:51:11,351
the professor who's teaching physics who
is on the side of the holocaust denier a

943
00:51:12,560 --> 00:51:14,000
and he's,
you know,

944
00:51:14,270 --> 00:51:16,220
maybe not necessarily teaching that in 
class,

945
00:51:16,221 --> 00:51:21,221
but does that have any ramifications for
his ability to teach physics?

946
00:51:21,830 --> 00:51:22,663
Probably not.
That's not a competency competency to 

947
00:51:25,131 --> 00:51:27,920
teach the topic that you were hired to 
teach thing.

948
00:51:27,940 --> 00:51:30,650
Right.
But if it leaked into the classroom then

949
00:51:30,651 --> 00:51:32,480
that then it's a separate issue.
That's.

950
00:51:32,510 --> 00:51:33,343
Well,
if you are teaching a class on physics 

951
00:51:34,611 --> 00:51:37,880
and find some occasion to talk about the
holocaust,

952
00:51:37,881 --> 00:51:38,714
I think you're probably not teaching the
thing that you were hired and then it's 

953
00:51:41,301 --> 00:51:43,590
up to the school to decide what to do.
That's it.

954
00:51:43,600 --> 00:51:44,433
It's a different problem I think.
I think that that indicates pretty 

955
00:51:48,621 --> 00:51:49,454
squarely along with the denial of the 
holocaust happened that you are in fact 

956
00:51:51,861 --> 00:51:53,840
losing your right.

957
00:51:54,020 --> 00:51:54,853
So what are some of the cases and maybe 
one or two cases that you guys are 

958
00:51:57,801 --> 00:52:01,490
working on right now or that you have 
your eye on right now that you think are

959
00:52:01,491 --> 00:52:03,260
particularly relevant that people should
know about?

960
00:52:03,320 --> 00:52:04,300
Well,
we just,

961
00:52:04,301 --> 00:52:06,110
uh,
issued a press release this morning.

962
00:52:06,111 --> 00:52:06,900
In fact,
uh,

963
00:52:06,900 --> 00:52:09,530
just a mere hour or two before I came 
here,

964
00:52:09,740 --> 00:52:10,573
uh,
at syracuse university where we sent a 

965
00:52:11,841 --> 00:52:13,130
letter on friday.
Uh,

966
00:52:13,230 --> 00:52:15,880
this one is just bAnanas.
Yeah.

967
00:52:16,010 --> 00:52:17,810
Let me pause you for a second.
I haven't read it yet,

968
00:52:17,960 --> 00:52:18,793
but I wanted to go to syracuse to be in 
broadcasting because I wanted it to be 

969
00:52:21,530 --> 00:52:24,200
like a news anchor or a or a sports 
center.

970
00:52:24,260 --> 00:52:25,430
Anchors road.
I really want it to be.

971
00:52:25,431 --> 00:52:26,264
But there are big broadcasting school,
so I'm already fascinated by this as a 

972
00:52:29,451 --> 00:52:30,690
place that's,
you know,

973
00:52:30,830 --> 00:52:34,640
about disseminating information or you 
might be glad you didn't hear this.

974
00:52:34,640 --> 00:52:35,473
Here we go.
a fraternity had an event every year 

975
00:52:40,190 --> 00:52:44,240
where the pledges or new members would 
come in.

976
00:52:44,241 --> 00:52:45,074
It was a private event and they would do
skits that roasted the other members of 

977
00:52:49,671 --> 00:52:50,504
the fraternity.
A lot of fraternities have this kind of 

978
00:52:53,121 --> 00:52:55,960
tradition,
I'm pretty sure that mine did,

979
00:52:56,960 --> 00:53:01,960
but they went through some skits and one
of them,

980
00:53:02,601 --> 00:53:03,434
for example,
was making fun of a member of the 

981
00:53:05,301 --> 00:53:09,950
fraternity who was unknown and vocal,
trump supporter and conservative.

982
00:53:10,460 --> 00:53:11,293
So they satirized him by having somebody
who was supposed to be him starting a 

983
00:53:15,530 --> 00:53:18,650
rival fraternity that was quote unquote 
a white empire.

984
00:53:18,950 --> 00:53:22,010
And to join people had to take a 
horrifically racist,

985
00:53:22,011 --> 00:53:26,850
antisemitic oath so far.
Sounds like it's all in good fun.

986
00:53:28,070 --> 00:53:29,700
Well,
whatever it may be tasteless,

987
00:53:29,701 --> 00:53:33,090
but all good friends over and you know 
what the satirizing any.

988
00:53:33,240 --> 00:53:36,810
It's no different than you see comedians
doing all the time on a stage.

989
00:53:36,810 --> 00:53:38,360
you're satirizing people.
Yeah.

990
00:53:38,440 --> 00:53:40,590
Uh,
another one was,

991
00:53:40,591 --> 00:53:44,010
uh,
they satirized one of their brothers for

992
00:53:44,011 --> 00:53:44,844
being chronically whipped by his 
girlfriend and portrayed him as a 

993
00:53:47,760 --> 00:53:51,450
mentally retarded and we had him in a 
wheelchair and all that stuff.

994
00:53:51,530 --> 00:53:52,363
And this was all on a private event.
And you hear the laughter in the 

995
00:53:55,471 --> 00:53:58,350
audience indicated that nobody was 
really offended by it.

996
00:53:58,351 --> 00:54:01,650
They understood this is kinda just 
poking fun at people.

997
00:54:02,880 --> 00:54:06,840
The problem is that videos of it leaked 
in the student newspaper,

998
00:54:06,841 --> 00:54:08,820
published them,
which you know,

999
00:54:08,821 --> 00:54:11,430
they had the right to do as well.
It can't be grudged than that,

1000
00:54:12,300 --> 00:54:15,120
and of course,
as you might imagine,

1001
00:54:15,750 --> 00:54:20,750
outrage erupted and the within a matter 
of days,

1002
00:54:21,870 --> 00:54:25,080
the fraternity had been expelled 
permanently from campus.

1003
00:54:26,310 --> 00:54:31,310
18 students have been charged with 
disciplinary conduct or discipline,

1004
00:54:31,530 --> 00:54:32,363
disciplinary code violations,
and they're being threatened with 

1005
00:54:35,430 --> 00:54:38,220
suspension or expulsion and this is like
all right,

1006
00:54:38,221 --> 00:54:39,054
before finals,
and meanwhile a adjunct faculty member 

1007
00:54:43,020 --> 00:54:43,853
had the gall to express concern about 
how the university was handling all of 

1008
00:54:46,831 --> 00:54:47,664
this and they immediately told them 
because your views don't align with 

1009
00:54:50,971 --> 00:54:51,804
ours,
you are no longer qualified to teach at 

1010
00:54:53,791 --> 00:54:55,230
syracuse university.

1011
00:54:55,290 --> 00:54:58,830
Unbelievable.
And it's incredibly author authoritarian

1012
00:54:58,831 --> 00:54:59,521
sounding.
I mean,

1013
00:54:59,521 --> 00:55:00,354
they are,
they're just willing to steamroll over 

1014
00:55:01,891 --> 00:55:06,891
anybody who gets in their way in pursuit
of really just giving somebody a head on

1015
00:55:07,201 --> 00:55:10,130
a pike so that the crowd is mollified,
you know,

1016
00:55:10,630 --> 00:55:11,463
it's nuts.
They've charged them with a sexual 

1017
00:55:14,011 --> 00:55:16,890
harassment,
discriminatory harassment.

1018
00:55:17,210 --> 00:55:18,043
Uh,
nevermind the fact that nobody who the 

1019
00:55:19,841 --> 00:55:24,841
speech was actually intended for 
actually was offended by it.

1020
00:55:25,760 --> 00:55:28,490
It didn't really,
it's not their fault,

1021
00:55:28,491 --> 00:55:30,350
you know,
they don't know how the videos lead,

1022
00:55:30,360 --> 00:55:31,193
they're posting to a private facebook 
page and somebody must've had access to 

1023
00:55:34,771 --> 00:55:36,480
somebody's computer or something like 
that,

1024
00:55:36,930 --> 00:55:41,490
but the speech was purely private and 
nobody was offended by it.

1025
00:55:41,580 --> 00:55:42,413
And if every conversation between two 
students can be the grounds for a 

1026
00:55:47,560 --> 00:55:48,393
disciplinary investigation because a 
third party later found out what was 

1027
00:55:51,151 --> 00:55:53,100
said during that conversation.
Well,

1028
00:55:54,070 --> 00:55:55,320
we don't be in jail.

1029
00:55:55,830 --> 00:55:56,663
Exactly.
It reduces free speech to a complete 

1030
00:55:59,521 --> 00:56:01,710
melody.
It's crazy.

1031
00:56:02,250 --> 00:56:03,160
Uh,
and you know,

1032
00:56:03,630 --> 00:56:05,220
it's just,
it's really,

1033
00:56:05,221 --> 00:56:10,221
it's galling and the,
just really a harsh and punitive bent of

1034
00:56:10,531 --> 00:56:12,370
the,
of the university and all of this is,

1035
00:56:12,390 --> 00:56:13,890
is mystifying.
Wait,

1036
00:56:13,891 --> 00:56:14,724
so just on the technical side now 
because this is something good that 

1037
00:56:17,251 --> 00:56:18,084
trump's done related to this because he 
got rid of a lot of the title nine 

1038
00:56:20,311 --> 00:56:23,170
expansions and all that and devoss and 
they got rid of that stuff,

1039
00:56:23,171 --> 00:56:24,700
which I assume you agree with.
Right?

1040
00:56:25,120 --> 00:56:26,470
Basically,
I mean,

1041
00:56:26,650 --> 00:56:29,060
it's stuff that we'd spent a lot of time
fighting against.

1042
00:56:29,100 --> 00:56:30,760
Okay.
So obama expanded it.

1043
00:56:30,761 --> 00:56:31,594
Trump got rid of it.
I think for the name and the name of 

1044
00:56:32,741 --> 00:56:33,574
free speech,
when you hear stories of like laura 

1045
00:56:34,691 --> 00:56:35,770
kipnis,
who I've had on and,

1046
00:56:35,850 --> 00:56:36,683
and many others,
the witch hunts that happen that are 

1047
00:56:38,531 --> 00:56:39,100
crazy.

1048
00:56:39,100 --> 00:56:42,220
So these policies that they are saying 
that these students violated,

1049
00:56:42,430 --> 00:56:44,560
these have nothing to do with government
policies,

1050
00:56:44,561 --> 00:56:44,981
right?
These,

1051
00:56:44,981 --> 00:56:47,380
they're saying they violated school 
policies,

1052
00:56:47,381 --> 00:56:48,214
is that correct?
They're discriminatory harassment 

1053
00:56:50,081 --> 00:56:50,914
policies are obviously drawn on a lot of
the same language because they receive 

1054
00:56:55,001 --> 00:56:58,060
federal money in the form of student 
loans and things like that.

1055
00:56:58,061 --> 00:56:58,894
So they actually still have to adhere to
title nine even though they're not a 

1056
00:57:00,821 --> 00:57:03,970
state institution obviously,
but you know,

1057
00:57:03,971 --> 00:57:08,380
they been charged with this laundry list
of offenses.

1058
00:57:08,440 --> 00:57:09,250
Uh,
they've,

1059
00:57:09,250 --> 00:57:10,990
the administration has been rushing 
through,

1060
00:57:10,991 --> 00:57:14,470
trying to kind of get the process over 
with as soon as possible.

1061
00:57:14,471 --> 00:57:15,304
Meanwhile,
not giving them really a lot of details 

1062
00:57:17,351 --> 00:57:20,290
until just recently in terms of,
you know,

1063
00:57:20,320 --> 00:57:22,690
what the charges are based on,
in all of this.

1064
00:57:22,691 --> 00:57:26,560
I mean,
it's very clearly a steam rolling and,

1065
00:57:26,580 --> 00:57:27,070
uh,
it's,

1066
00:57:27,070 --> 00:57:28,210
it's outrageous.

1067
00:57:28,330 --> 00:57:29,170
Uh,
and you know,

1068
00:57:29,171 --> 00:57:30,004
that's kind of the most recent thing.
So tell me a little bit about how you 

1069
00:57:32,501 --> 00:57:33,760
guys get involved in that.
So okay,

1070
00:57:33,761 --> 00:57:34,594
so you issue a press statement now or a 
press release now they know they have a 

1071
00:57:37,301 --> 00:57:38,134
little bit of public defense.
Do you guys actually work with the 

1072
00:57:40,631 --> 00:57:42,610
students,
like just kind of lay out how that whole

1073
00:57:42,790 --> 00:57:43,810
process goes?
Yeah.

1074
00:57:43,811 --> 00:57:44,520
So,
uh,

1075
00:57:44,520 --> 00:57:45,353
on our website we have a format anyone 
can fill out to request help and me and 

1076
00:57:50,111 --> 00:57:54,150
my team every morning we will go through
the case submissions and uh,

1077
00:57:54,160 --> 00:57:58,270
we'll review them and follow up for more
documentation if necessary.

1078
00:57:58,271 --> 00:57:59,104
And like I said,
we get damn near close to a thousand of 

1079
00:58:00,311 --> 00:58:01,210
them a year now,
uh,

1080
00:58:01,211 --> 00:58:06,211
which is a whole lot of work.
And we investigate and develop the cases

1081
00:58:08,570 --> 00:58:11,030
and figure out what the best situ,
you know,

1082
00:58:11,050 --> 00:58:13,740
the best possible tactics in each case 
would be a.

1083
00:58:14,080 --> 00:58:14,913
Usually the next step involves writing a
letter telling the university which in 

1084
00:58:17,771 --> 00:58:20,920
syracuse case we sent that on friday,
telling them,

1085
00:58:20,921 --> 00:58:22,900
hey,
this is the applicable law,

1086
00:58:22,910 --> 00:58:27,640
are these applicable norms that you 
should be adhering to as though college,

1087
00:58:28,040 --> 00:58:30,490
um,
and here's why what you're doing has run

1088
00:58:30,491 --> 00:58:33,970
a foul of all of that.
Generally speaking,

1089
00:58:34,240 --> 00:58:35,073
you know,
we'll wait for a response in good faith 

1090
00:58:38,260 --> 00:58:39,093
given university some time to 
acknowledge our concerns and work 

1091
00:58:40,841 --> 00:58:42,640
through them and,
you know,

1092
00:58:42,641 --> 00:58:44,650
otherwise we will,
excuse me,

1093
00:58:45,430 --> 00:58:46,263
issue a press release and start bringing
public pressure to bear sometimes in 

1094
00:58:49,961 --> 00:58:50,794
public college and university cases.
We'll take it to litigation if we have 

1095
00:58:54,650 --> 00:58:55,483
to.
Not every case obviously because you 

1096
00:58:56,981 --> 00:58:58,660
know,
there's a range of cases that are,

1097
00:58:59,340 --> 00:59:01,270
you know,
make for a good lawsuit.

1098
00:59:01,271 --> 00:59:02,104
But even just recently filed a lawsuit 
at joliet junior college and this is 

1099
00:59:05,891 --> 00:59:06,724
kind of,
again,

1100
00:59:06,730 --> 00:59:07,563
kind of flips the narrative a little bit
because there was a students who saw a 

1101
00:59:11,560 --> 00:59:12,393
people,
uh,

1102
00:59:12,640 --> 00:59:13,473
basically talking about how capitalism 
is great and decided that she wanted to 

1103
00:59:17,021 --> 00:59:18,490
make a good point about socialism.

1104
00:59:18,670 --> 00:59:23,300
So she handed out and flyers about how,
you know,

1105
00:59:23,420 --> 00:59:27,080
it said shut down capitalism,
inviting people to like a workshop,

1106
00:59:27,590 --> 00:59:28,423
a about socialism.
This was actually not far from where I 

1107
00:59:31,011 --> 00:59:33,530
live in chicago,
joliet junior college,

1108
00:59:34,130 --> 00:59:34,963
and she was actually confronted by a 
number of campus police officers who 

1109
00:59:39,921 --> 00:59:40,754
pulled her to an interrogation room,
demanded to examine the flyers and then 

1110
00:59:44,421 --> 00:59:47,240
confiscated them and saying,
you can't do that here.

1111
00:59:47,241 --> 00:59:47,750
You know,
the,

1112
00:59:47,750 --> 00:59:50,680
the political climate right now is,
you know,

1113
00:59:50,840 --> 00:59:51,673
might start something.
I'm actually shocked to hear it 

1114
00:59:53,541 --> 00:59:55,730
happening that that story is not the 
reverse.

1115
00:59:55,930 --> 00:59:58,520
If this is an odd one,
I'm glad you used it as an example.

1116
00:59:58,521 --> 00:59:59,240
Actually,
you know,

1117
00:59:59,240 --> 01:00:01,160
it goes to show.
I actually,

1118
01:00:01,161 --> 01:00:02,870
you know,
you'll be interested to hear this.

1119
01:00:02,871 --> 01:00:03,640
I,
my,

1120
01:00:03,640 --> 01:00:06,110
my team and I actually did a really a 
quick analysis,

1121
01:00:06,111 --> 01:00:06,944
and this isn't scientific or anything of
all the public cases that we've had on 

1122
01:00:11,481 --> 01:00:12,314
our website from the beginning of fires 
history and actually more than half of 

1123
01:00:17,631 --> 01:00:20,300
them have nothing to do with politics.

1124
01:00:20,930 --> 01:00:25,930
More than half of them are simply 
administrators having power again.

1125
01:00:27,710 --> 01:00:28,543
And when they have the power,
they will use it to regulate or silence 

1126
01:00:32,901 --> 01:00:33,734
speech that they find inconvenient or 
critical of the university or 

1127
01:00:37,191 --> 01:00:41,450
administrators or,
or just kind of not nice,

1128
01:00:41,480 --> 01:00:42,313
generally less than half of our cases 
had to do with speakers being silenced 

1129
01:00:47,571 --> 01:00:48,404
specifically because of the viewpoint 
that we're espousing on a political 

1130
01:00:52,131 --> 01:00:53,570
level.
It's,

1131
01:00:54,890 --> 01:00:55,723
you know,
it kind of undoes a lot of the 

1132
01:00:57,051 --> 01:00:58,730
narrative.
And to be honest,

1133
01:00:58,731 --> 01:01:00,890
I'm kind of a little bit tired of the 
whole,

1134
01:01:01,100 --> 01:01:03,140
whether the right or left love 
censorship,

1135
01:01:03,141 --> 01:01:05,600
more argument.
I think it's completely unproductive and

1136
01:01:05,601 --> 01:01:06,434
does nothing to solve the problem,
which is we all need to understand why 

1137
01:01:10,281 --> 01:01:14,270
protecting free speech is important.
I'd mUch rather focus my time there.

1138
01:01:14,720 --> 01:01:16,370
Um,
and you know,

1139
01:01:16,371 --> 01:01:20,800
so it's really that that whole narrative
can,

1140
01:01:20,900 --> 01:01:23,630
could use a little deconstructing for a 
little bit.

1141
01:01:23,630 --> 01:01:27,350
And I'm glad that we had that case that 
kind of allowed us to,

1142
01:01:27,380 --> 01:01:28,213
to show it and people appreciate it.
I got a lot of messages from people on 

1143
01:01:31,281 --> 01:01:32,001
the right who said,
you know,

1144
01:01:32,001 --> 01:01:36,650
I disagree with everything that that 
young woman had to say.

1145
01:01:37,460 --> 01:01:41,090
And I would sit there and now and yelled
at in her face,

1146
01:01:41,450 --> 01:01:42,283
but you know what,
I'm damn glad you guys stood up for her 

1147
01:01:44,301 --> 01:01:45,134
rights.
and you know,

1148
01:01:45,710 --> 01:01:47,450
when I get messages like that,
it just,

1149
01:01:47,480 --> 01:01:51,410
it warms my heart and I get them from 
people on both sides saying,

1150
01:01:51,411 --> 01:01:52,244
you know what,
I probably wouldn't have reacted in the 

1151
01:01:54,771 --> 01:01:57,230
same way you did leaping to a defense of
free speech.

1152
01:01:57,410 --> 01:02:00,260
But I'm glad you did it because I got 
something out of that.

1153
01:02:00,500 --> 01:02:01,091
Uh,
you know,

1154
01:02:01,091 --> 01:02:04,280
it made me think about why my reaction 
wasn't that,

1155
01:02:04,690 --> 01:02:06,830
uh,
and if I,

1156
01:02:06,890 --> 01:02:09,500
if I get,
if I can elicit that in people,

1157
01:02:10,300 --> 01:02:11,960
I feel great about my day.

1158
01:02:12,800 --> 01:02:14,750
That's the heavy lifting,
I think.

1159
01:02:14,780 --> 01:02:15,613
Well,
that's a beautiful thing and that's why 

1160
01:02:16,761 --> 01:02:18,360
I did what you guys are doing.
A,

1161
01:02:18,740 --> 01:02:22,410
the thing I want to mention is that I 
just remembered in this last moment that

1162
01:02:22,411 --> 01:02:23,640
the reason that you're here,
I,

1163
01:02:23,670 --> 01:02:25,980
so I had wanted to have one of you guys 
on for about a year or so,

1164
01:02:26,280 --> 01:02:28,650
and you've been on our,
our master list of all this.

1165
01:02:29,070 --> 01:02:31,740
And then I think about three months or 
so ago,

1166
01:02:31,741 --> 01:02:32,574
someone tweeted at me that they were at 
school at school library and they were 

1167
01:02:37,201 --> 01:02:41,910
watching a video of me and ben shapiro 
and that they were reported to the,

1168
01:02:41,970 --> 01:02:46,500
either the diversity office or one of 
these things that it was hate speech and

1169
01:02:46,501 --> 01:02:49,680
that another student shouldn't be 
allowed to watch these,

1170
01:02:49,681 --> 01:02:51,040
these evil things,
etc.

1171
01:02:51,070 --> 01:02:53,670
Etc.
It turns out that this was in the uk,

1172
01:02:53,671 --> 01:02:57,840
so it was not under the jurisdiction 
that you guys a cover,

1173
01:02:57,841 --> 01:02:59,280
which obviously is the United States.

1174
01:02:59,640 --> 01:03:02,190
Um,
but it just shows that this thing,

1175
01:03:02,310 --> 01:03:06,630
this monster that we're fighting is not 
local to us here in America.

1176
01:03:06,631 --> 01:03:07,464
It's all over the world.
And there are other organizations like 

1177
01:03:10,081 --> 01:03:12,150
fire that do this work.
And uh,

1178
01:03:12,390 --> 01:03:13,223
yeah.
And although it's depressing to know 

1179
01:03:14,251 --> 01:03:17,190
that somebody is being reported for 
watching a video that I put out there,

1180
01:03:17,400 --> 01:03:20,070
it's good to know that you guys all came
to the rush.

1181
01:03:20,071 --> 01:03:21,420
You all came to the defense and you were
like,

1182
01:03:21,421 --> 01:03:22,770
who is it?
Can we connect with them?

1183
01:03:22,890 --> 01:03:23,723
You know,
I connected them with some of your 

1184
01:03:24,001 --> 01:03:24,601
people,
I think.

1185
01:03:24,601 --> 01:03:28,940
And maybe you've passed them on to them 
with spikes over there.

1186
01:03:29,250 --> 01:03:29,831
Yeah,
it is.

1187
01:03:29,831 --> 01:03:30,664
And you know,
you see it happening in Canada all the 

1188
01:03:32,311 --> 01:03:33,660
time in the uk.
I mean,

1189
01:03:34,110 --> 01:03:37,410
you can,
I have google alerts set and every.

1190
01:03:37,650 --> 01:03:38,483
No,
I wouldn't say every morning because 

1191
01:03:39,061 --> 01:03:40,950
it's more like 40,000
times a day.

1192
01:03:40,950 --> 01:03:45,600
I get emails from google with the latest
headlines about free speech and it's not

1193
01:03:45,601 --> 01:03:46,434
just even the uk and Canada.
There are students protesting in India 

1194
01:03:48,871 --> 01:03:52,320
about freedom of speech issues and all 
kinds of countries.

1195
01:03:52,740 --> 01:03:55,080
Australia,
it's a big conversation right now.

1196
01:03:55,081 --> 01:03:55,990
This is,
you know,

1197
01:03:56,490 --> 01:04:00,240
this is not limited to here.
It's not limited to anywhere.

1198
01:04:00,241 --> 01:04:01,074
This,
the idea that college campuses are kind 

1199
01:04:03,361 --> 01:04:07,030
of a,
both a microcosm of society and a,

1200
01:04:07,390 --> 01:04:12,300
a training ground and an eye,
a place where the ideas of the country,

1201
01:04:12,620 --> 01:04:14,880
uh,
kind of come from in a large sense.

1202
01:04:15,340 --> 01:04:19,320
That's a kind of a global,
a concept.

1203
01:04:19,321 --> 01:04:22,650
I don't think that's limited to higher 
education in the United States.

1204
01:04:22,651 --> 01:04:23,860
And you know,
it's,

1205
01:04:24,280 --> 01:04:28,050
I really hope that we can convince 
students that's where it's safeguarding.

1206
01:04:28,090 --> 01:04:28,850
Uh,
it's,

1207
01:04:28,850 --> 01:04:33,000
it's too important not to rel.
Said my friend,

1208
01:04:33,001 --> 01:04:33,834
I'm with ya,
and for more on the fine work that ari 

1209
01:04:35,941 --> 01:04:39,420
and the fire folks are doing,
