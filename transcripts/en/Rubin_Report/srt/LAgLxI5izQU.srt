1
00:00:05,150 --> 00:00:05,983
Joining me today is British author,
journalist and political commentator 

2
00:00:09,591 --> 00:00:14,450
Douglas Murray.
He is also the associate director of the

3
00:00:14,450 --> 00:00:17,120
Henry Jackson Society and associate 
editor of the spectator.

4
00:00:17,270 --> 00:00:18,560
Douglas,
welcome to the Rubin report.

5
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:20,940
Very good to be with him to see you in 
person.

6
00:00:20,990 --> 00:00:23,670
I don't know how we haven't done this in
person yet.

7
00:00:23,671 --> 00:00:24,740
They haven't been in La.
It's.

8
00:00:24,770 --> 00:00:26,480
Yeah.
What in God's name are you doing?

9
00:00:26,481 --> 00:00:29,340
Living anywhere else besides la?
Uh,

10
00:00:29,570 --> 00:00:30,403
well it's,
it's actually not my favorite bit of 

11
00:00:31,941 --> 00:00:32,774
America.
I have to say I find it slightly 

12
00:00:33,710 --> 00:00:36,740
unscented and routines because also 
because I don't drive.

13
00:00:36,741 --> 00:00:40,160
So La is sort of hell because you can't 
walk anywhere.

14
00:00:40,550 --> 00:00:41,383
Well I know you're not making that up 
because you were stuck on a plane for 

15
00:00:44,181 --> 00:00:47,510
about four hours last night.
You arrived at like 2:00

16
00:00:47,510 --> 00:00:48,343
AM.
Then we tried to send a car to get you 

17
00:00:49,161 --> 00:00:49,994
this morning.
That took some time if it's me being 

18
00:00:52,881 --> 00:00:53,714
difficult.

19
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:54,633
No,
I actually,

20
00:00:54,660 --> 00:00:57,800
I used to watch the three films before 
the plane even took off last night.

21
00:00:57,801 --> 00:00:59,450
She's New York.
Anything good?

22
00:01:00,220 --> 00:01:03,940
No awful films.
They're all bad or mad?

23
00:01:04,370 --> 00:01:05,203
Almost always bad.
Do you feel you're at your intellectual 

24
00:01:08,151 --> 00:01:09,620
best right now because you didn't get 
much sleep?

25
00:01:10,310 --> 00:01:14,320
The you're ready to do that defends our 
mangers.

26
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:15,680
You want to be.
Well,

27
00:01:15,681 --> 00:01:17,570
I've got some pretty rigorous questions 
right here.

28
00:01:17,830 --> 00:01:19,130
Uh,
but I think that's an interesting way to

29
00:01:19,131 --> 00:01:21,910
kick off because you are somebody that,
you know,

30
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:23,690
everything that I,
that I see you.

31
00:01:23,691 --> 00:01:26,280
Right.
And the events that you speak at and,

32
00:01:26,281 --> 00:01:27,830
and the talks that you've given all that
stuff,

33
00:01:27,950 --> 00:01:28,783
I mean you have to be at your 
intellectual best pretty much all the 

34
00:01:31,821 --> 00:01:33,180
time.
Uh,

35
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:35,200
I don't know if you feel you always are,
but,

36
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:37,940
but what kind of pressure does that put 
you under just to be,

37
00:01:37,970 --> 00:01:39,660
to be one of the people that,
you know,

38
00:01:39,750 --> 00:01:40,583
you have to have a cohesive set of 
thoughts and be able to defend them all 

39
00:01:43,191 --> 00:01:44,024
the time.

40
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:49,080
I'm not sure you have to have the keys,
but I tell you what I mean.

41
00:01:51,410 --> 00:01:52,243
I don't admire or envy politicians for 
having to have the thing of having to 

42
00:01:57,651 --> 00:01:59,150
turn up,
say the right thing.

43
00:01:59,151 --> 00:02:00,950
Never be off message and all that sort 
of thing.

44
00:02:00,951 --> 00:02:02,300
I kind of feel,
you know,

45
00:02:02,450 --> 00:02:03,620
I'm a writer,
I can,

46
00:02:04,190 --> 00:02:06,160
I can have bad days,
uh,

47
00:02:06,170 --> 00:02:10,370
I can change my mind on things.
I can nuance things,

48
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:14,450
texture things or I can be garbled one 
day and um,

49
00:02:14,870 --> 00:02:16,430
you know,
nobody says,

50
00:02:16,940 --> 00:02:18,770
oh my God,
he's a total train wreck.

51
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:20,930
I don't know.
I don't know if they did.

52
00:02:20,931 --> 00:02:21,530
Oh,
when we care.

53
00:02:21,530 --> 00:02:22,190
But.
Well,

54
00:02:22,190 --> 00:02:23,023
it's funny you say that because right 
before we started we were talking about 

55
00:02:24,231 --> 00:02:25,064
social media a little bit when you were 
saying how you don't respond that often 

56
00:02:27,831 --> 00:02:29,600
or,
or paying that much attention to that.

57
00:02:29,601 --> 00:02:31,010
I'm not on Facebook,
I'm on twitter.

58
00:02:31,011 --> 00:02:34,660
I use twitter as a way to communicate to
the few people who can,

59
00:02:34,690 --> 00:02:36,590
you know,
anything I write or appear on.

60
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:37,873
Um,
but I don't talk to the world as it 

61
00:02:40,521 --> 00:02:41,440
were.
Um,

62
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:44,840
I don't think it's doable.
I think it drives people mad.

63
00:02:45,170 --> 00:02:47,880
Seeing some of the least,
you know,

64
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:51,590
Bernard really promising minds.
My generation slightly wracked by social

65
00:02:51,591 --> 00:02:52,450
media.
Yeah.

66
00:02:52,540 --> 00:02:53,570
Um,
you know,

67
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:56,630
you wouldn't,
you wouldn't seek out people to shout at

68
00:02:56,631 --> 00:02:59,000
you in the street,
so you wouldn't.

69
00:02:59,140 --> 00:03:00,190
If they did say,
come

70
00:03:00,190 --> 00:03:01,023
over here,
say this more regular basis and do it 

71
00:03:03,521 --> 00:03:06,760
when I wake up and turn over in the 
morning and turning my phone on.

72
00:03:07,090 --> 00:03:10,240
Yeah.
So I do think that people have to find a

73
00:03:10,241 --> 00:03:13,600
sort of reasonable way to live in this 
strange,

74
00:03:13,601 --> 00:03:14,434
strange world,
which is even stranger in our hail is 

75
00:03:15,901 --> 00:03:16,170
now.

76
00:03:16,170 --> 00:03:16,950
Yeah.
Well it's,

77
00:03:16,950 --> 00:03:19,680
it's much stranger in La and we are 
going for dinner tonight.

78
00:03:19,681 --> 00:03:22,560
I'm going to show you how we can get,
you know,

79
00:03:22,561 --> 00:03:25,020
what's weird in La.
I'm gonna I'm gonna show you tonight.

80
00:03:25,350 --> 00:03:27,150
Um,
tell me a little bit.

81
00:03:27,210 --> 00:03:28,043
So we've done this once before and it 
was about two years ago and I had just 

82
00:03:30,121 --> 00:03:30,954
started doing an interview show and we,
we talked about a lot of the problems 

83
00:03:33,151 --> 00:03:33,984
that we both had with the left and the 
rise of Islam in some of that we're 

84
00:03:35,671 --> 00:03:36,900
going to cover here.
Uh,

85
00:03:36,990 --> 00:03:37,823
but I thought maybe we could just talk 
about a little bit about your history 

86
00:03:40,531 --> 00:03:43,440
first and what kind of brought you to be
one of the,

87
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:47,220
one of the few people that is so 
outspoken on some of these issues.

88
00:03:47,221 --> 00:03:49,650
What,
what made you care about the free speech

89
00:03:49,651 --> 00:03:52,140
stuff about what's happening in the 
west,

90
00:03:52,141 --> 00:03:54,030
all of this stuff,
when did that really spark in you?

91
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:55,950
Um,
it's hard.

92
00:03:55,951 --> 00:03:56,784
I mean,
these things are easier to recognize 

93
00:03:58,430 --> 00:04:00,710
other people than they are in yourself.
Um,

94
00:04:01,380 --> 00:04:03,870
I've written about a lot of different 
things in my life.

95
00:04:03,871 --> 00:04:07,110
I started writing very young.
I became a,

96
00:04:07,230 --> 00:04:10,860
became a published author as it were.
I wrote my first book when I was 18,

97
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:15,120
came out when I was 19 or 20 I think.
And um,

98
00:04:15,150 --> 00:04:17,030
that was on literature,
um,

99
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:19,230
and,
or literally figure.

100
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:23,640
And then I started writing about 
politics and the one thing which,

101
00:04:23,670 --> 00:04:24,150
uh,
uh,

102
00:04:24,150 --> 00:04:24,983
somebody once said to me about me as 
well that I thought it was probably 

103
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:31,500
somewhere near the truth was that 
somebody once said that I had a very low

104
00:04:31,501 --> 00:04:34,740
tolerance threshold for lies.
And I think there is something in that.

105
00:04:34,741 --> 00:04:35,574
I,
I,

106
00:04:35,610 --> 00:04:38,550
I genuinely,
maybe it all wear out at some point,

107
00:04:38,551 --> 00:04:42,720
but I'm just overdose as it were on 
lies.

108
00:04:42,790 --> 00:04:44,130
But I,
I just,

109
00:04:44,730 --> 00:04:45,850
I find,
um,

110
00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:49,290
I,
I don't like being told lies and I don't

111
00:04:49,291 --> 00:04:51,980
like it about historical things.
That's my first book is partly about,

112
00:04:52,110 --> 00:04:52,943
I think it has sort of set of historical
misunderstandings that had happened in 

113
00:04:55,051 --> 00:04:58,680
relation to the figure I was writing 
about and I wanted to correct them.

114
00:04:58,710 --> 00:05:01,020
And then in politics,
of course,

115
00:05:01,021 --> 00:05:04,060
if you have a low tolerance for lies,
maybe it's just not the right area.

116
00:05:04,460 --> 00:05:06,340
So that was my next question.
Maybe you picked it,

117
00:05:06,350 --> 00:05:09,120
not because I got into surfing or 
something I didn't know,

118
00:05:09,130 --> 00:05:09,940
but,
but,

119
00:05:09,940 --> 00:05:12,960
but policy,
politics and political lives,

120
00:05:12,961 --> 00:05:14,150
um,
uh,

121
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:15,353
galvanizes me.
And I suppose the other thing is that 

122
00:05:17,620 --> 00:05:19,440
I'm not a political,
not,

123
00:05:19,441 --> 00:05:20,274
I'm not,
I don't really care who's running in 

124
00:05:21,931 --> 00:05:24,730
that district for which party and which,
you know,

125
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:28,860
party they voted for four years ago.
Now I sort of thing is interesting.

126
00:05:28,860 --> 00:05:32,010
It's not what I spend my life feeling 
particularly oppressed or,

127
00:05:32,420 --> 00:05:33,450
you know,
enamored with.

128
00:05:33,930 --> 00:05:35,000
But I do.
Um,

129
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:39,570
I do think that if you care about the 
culture in the widest sense as I do,

130
00:05:40,110 --> 00:05:42,270
then you've got to be interested in 
politics,

131
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:42,681
uh,
you,

132
00:05:42,681 --> 00:05:45,090
you,
you've got to take some attitude towards

133
00:05:45,091 --> 00:05:45,924
it and they say in order that you 
further your political goals or 

134
00:05:49,801 --> 00:05:51,780
something if you want to do that,
you should really be a politician.

135
00:05:52,410 --> 00:05:57,410
But I think in order to try to safe 
guard coach,

136
00:05:57,621 --> 00:05:58,454
I mean,
I mean,

137
00:05:58,580 --> 00:05:59,413
I don't even mean the coats.
I mean really to safeguard the practice 

138
00:06:01,191 --> 00:06:05,600
of culture and then that's what politics
seems to me to be very largely for.

139
00:06:05,660 --> 00:06:08,780
Um,
I'm quite interested in taxation and not

140
00:06:08,781 --> 00:06:09,614
very interested in it.
I just want the circumstances to be 

141
00:06:13,191 --> 00:06:15,920
right for the culture to thrive.

142
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:17,930
Yeah.
So when people say,

143
00:06:17,931 --> 00:06:18,441
Oh,
you know,

144
00:06:18,441 --> 00:06:20,600
I'm not a political person or something 
like that,

145
00:06:20,890 --> 00:06:23,780
I,
I hate that phrase because it really.

146
00:06:23,810 --> 00:06:25,850
What are you actually saying?
You're like,

147
00:06:25,910 --> 00:06:29,630
you're either pretending that you're 
above it or you somehow don't need it.

148
00:06:29,631 --> 00:06:31,550
And yet politics,
you're right.

149
00:06:31,551 --> 00:06:32,384
It's about creating the conditions so 
that you can do all of the other things 

150
00:06:34,971 --> 00:06:35,390
you care.

151
00:06:35,390 --> 00:06:36,223
I think what people,
what a lot of people mean when they say 

152
00:06:37,731 --> 00:06:38,940
that is,
um,

153
00:06:39,180 --> 00:06:40,013
I'm not a party person,
I'm not gonna bore on about the Labor 

154
00:06:43,730 --> 00:06:45,050
Party Organ Soda Party of the Democrats 
or Republicans.

155
00:06:45,380 --> 00:06:49,340
I think that's what what people mean,
but in any case,

156
00:06:49,341 --> 00:06:52,400
a lot of people who said that sometime 
ago don't see that anymore.

157
00:06:53,060 --> 00:06:53,893
In fact,
that maybe the more they said in the 

158
00:06:55,850 --> 00:07:00,180
past they weren't a politics person,
the more now the shrieking and jibberish

159
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:01,370
and storming.

160
00:07:01,470 --> 00:07:03,360
Yeah.
Do you think there's a danger in that?

161
00:07:03,361 --> 00:07:04,800
So we had all these people that,
you know,

162
00:07:04,830 --> 00:07:06,240
whatever,
that whatever that meant to them,

163
00:07:06,241 --> 00:07:07,074
they weren't politics people,
but now everybody's shrieking and 

164
00:07:09,661 --> 00:07:12,720
screaming and everyone's in the part of 
it that you just said,

165
00:07:12,721 --> 00:07:13,554
that doesn't really do it for you.
That piece of the day to day race horse 

166
00:07:17,070 --> 00:07:17,903
stuff.
And that's why I try to focus on the 

167
00:07:19,530 --> 00:07:20,363
philosophical stuff because [inaudible] 
who's running for this or all of that 

168
00:07:24,271 --> 00:07:24,631
stuff.
Yes,

169
00:07:24,631 --> 00:07:28,510
it's important at some level,
but it's the bigger picture stuff that I

170
00:07:28,530 --> 00:07:29,363
think really matters.

171
00:07:29,410 --> 00:07:30,460
Yes.
And,

172
00:07:30,461 --> 00:07:32,290
uh,
you know,

173
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:34,840
to a great extent in your country and 
your mind,

174
00:07:34,990 --> 00:07:35,823
uh,
there is a type of person now who I 

175
00:07:37,421 --> 00:07:39,850
think has got politics all the wrong way
around.

176
00:07:39,910 --> 00:07:41,620
I mean,
maybe it is,

177
00:07:41,621 --> 00:07:42,454
as I say,
people who didn't pay much attention to 

178
00:07:43,331 --> 00:07:45,250
it in the past,
but there are people who are now,

179
00:07:46,180 --> 00:07:47,013
I think putting onto politics.
I'm an amount of weight that it can't 

180
00:07:51,191 --> 00:07:52,460
bear.
Yeah.

181
00:07:53,230 --> 00:07:55,840
It's about their entire existence as it 
were.

182
00:07:56,860 --> 00:07:59,780
And I wouldn't want that to be the case,
uh,

183
00:08:00,070 --> 00:08:01,120
at all.
I mean,

184
00:08:01,121 --> 00:08:01,954
I,
uh,

185
00:08:02,230 --> 00:08:04,060
you know,
I had with a colleague sometime ago,

186
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:08,950
sort of informal competition of the 
Conservative Party won the 2015 election

187
00:08:08,951 --> 00:08:11,420
in Britain.
Had An informal competition to say,

188
00:08:11,430 --> 00:08:13,540
now what's the nuttiest thing anyone's 
said?

189
00:08:13,541 --> 00:08:14,374
And the best was his woman at the 
Guardian who wrote a column saying that 

190
00:08:17,441 --> 00:08:18,274
basically she cried herself to sleep 
every night and she woke up in the 

191
00:08:19,991 --> 00:08:21,910
morning crying and she,
sometimes she stopped crying.

192
00:08:21,911 --> 00:08:23,020
She woke up because you thought,
oh my God,

193
00:08:23,021 --> 00:08:23,741
I've had a nightmare.
No,

194
00:08:23,741 --> 00:08:25,360
it's true.
And then she burst into tears again.

195
00:08:28,270 --> 00:08:29,930
That person shouldn't really be in the 
community,

196
00:08:29,931 --> 00:08:30,764
it should,
they,

197
00:08:31,770 --> 00:08:33,510
but if I,
I,

198
00:08:33,820 --> 00:08:35,080
you know,
I have views.

199
00:08:35,081 --> 00:08:35,914
I was on here,
I want to win and at any one time which 

200
00:08:37,541 --> 00:08:38,590
party I'd vote for,
but,

201
00:08:39,190 --> 00:08:40,023
but I cannot imagine any scenario in 
which I became such a jittering wreck 

202
00:08:45,130 --> 00:08:45,963
that I just wept all the time or because
she might not have been telling the 

203
00:08:48,761 --> 00:08:52,690
truth.
Is this con or thought it wise to say to

204
00:08:52,691 --> 00:08:54,700
people,
that's the state I'm in.

205
00:08:55,170 --> 00:08:55,591
Right,
right.

206
00:08:55,591 --> 00:08:56,160
Well,
it shows

207
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:57,740
her victimhood.
She's such a victim.

208
00:08:57,750 --> 00:08:58,583
She can't sleep the best is when you see
the Huffington post or one of these 

209
00:09:00,781 --> 00:09:01,614
pieces probably in the Guardian to where
it's not just them that are carrying 

210
00:09:03,391 --> 00:09:05,160
their children.
Waking Up,

211
00:09:05,161 --> 00:09:05,994
having nightmares about trump.
My three year old's having a nightmare 

212
00:09:08,191 --> 00:09:10,950
about drumming.
What can I,

213
00:09:10,990 --> 00:09:14,550
what should I tell my three year old?
But now he's asking about trump.

214
00:09:14,551 --> 00:09:17,250
And again,
I know I tend to go to sleep.

215
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:19,740
You know,
it's so funny,

216
00:09:19,750 --> 00:09:21,960
I,
I tweeted this out a couple months ago,

217
00:09:21,961 --> 00:09:23,790
but when we're in the middle of the 
election,

218
00:09:24,090 --> 00:09:24,511
uh,
you know,

219
00:09:24,511 --> 00:09:27,720
all these articles are getting ready to 
kick kick how trump is affecting kids.

220
00:09:27,721 --> 00:09:29,460
This one thing.
So I asked,

221
00:09:29,461 --> 00:09:31,050
I asked my,
my,

222
00:09:31,051 --> 00:09:32,790
at the time,
I think he was five or six,

223
00:09:32,791 --> 00:09:34,020
my nephew,
I said,

224
00:09:34,021 --> 00:09:35,580
what do you,
what do you know about Donald Trump?

225
00:09:35,970 --> 00:09:36,930
He looks at me,
he's like,

226
00:09:37,050 --> 00:09:39,530
he has bad hair and a red tie.
And I was like,

227
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:42,480
that's what again,
that's what a kid would think.

228
00:09:43,140 --> 00:09:44,190
Alright.
So I want to talk about your book,

229
00:09:44,191 --> 00:09:45,024
but I thought before we get into that,
I want to do a little bit more on just 

230
00:09:46,891 --> 00:09:49,440
sort of language in general and the free
speech thing.

231
00:09:49,830 --> 00:09:50,663
So when you come to America,
because we have some extra protections 

232
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:55,673
for now,
at least on free speech that you guys 

233
00:09:57,631 --> 00:10:02,520
across Europe don't have.
Do you feel an extra degree of freedom?

234
00:10:02,730 --> 00:10:04,500
You don't strike me as someone that ever
bites your tongue,

235
00:10:04,501 --> 00:10:05,334
but when you come here and know that we 
have such a great free or do you see 

236
00:10:08,580 --> 00:10:10,320
something a little different here 
perhaps?

237
00:10:10,410 --> 00:10:11,250
I think you do.
I mean,

238
00:10:11,251 --> 00:10:12,084
I,
I think you just got to separate out 

239
00:10:12,891 --> 00:10:13,724
between the,
what your legal rights are as it were 

240
00:10:16,101 --> 00:10:19,160
and what the actual practice is these 
days.

241
00:10:21,170 --> 00:10:22,250
Yes.
Legally.

242
00:10:22,251 --> 00:10:23,084
I mean I'm,
there's nothing I say that it's illegal 

243
00:10:24,591 --> 00:10:26,900
in Britain or Europe.
Um,

244
00:10:27,380 --> 00:10:30,410
uh,
and so I don't particularly feel,

245
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:31,273
you know,
and he sort of freer to say anything 

246
00:10:32,691 --> 00:10:33,524
here because there's nothing I would say
here that I wouldn't say there and vice 

247
00:10:35,421 --> 00:10:36,900
versa.
Um,

248
00:10:37,130 --> 00:10:39,320
it's true that the,
the having a,

249
00:10:39,380 --> 00:10:40,213
an amendment to our constitution that 
she writes this in the law is a useful 

250
00:10:43,311 --> 00:10:44,144
thing to have a,
we of course don't even have a 

251
00:10:45,981 --> 00:10:49,280
constitution in Britain which has its 
own advantages and problems.

252
00:10:49,281 --> 00:10:50,300
But,
uh,

253
00:10:51,140 --> 00:10:51,973
but I think these things have to be 
slightly divorced from the reality of 

254
00:10:54,031 --> 00:10:57,980
the practice as is at the moment and at 
the moment,

255
00:10:57,981 --> 00:10:58,814
I think your probably in a worse 
situation than we are in Britain or 

256
00:11:02,031 --> 00:11:05,080
Europe in relation to speech,
um,

257
00:11:05,150 --> 00:11:05,983
mainly because of a generation of people
who are growing up and the most 

258
00:11:10,101 --> 00:11:13,110
privileged generation in history who,
um,

259
00:11:13,490 --> 00:11:14,323
seemed to think that speech is violence 
and that in response to violence you 

260
00:11:20,061 --> 00:11:22,790
should be violent.
And if you make that leap,

261
00:11:22,820 --> 00:11:27,410
then the response or somebody speaking 
is the them and a or shutting down or to

262
00:11:27,411 --> 00:11:31,970
burn a building or to get them killed or
whatever you want.

263
00:11:31,971 --> 00:11:34,820
And I see that all the time,
all over the place.

264
00:11:37,050 --> 00:11:39,860
Somebody I know in Holland who died just
a couple weeks ago,

265
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:41,273
a lot of people in the press have him 
demonizing him and his house was 

266
00:11:44,151 --> 00:11:48,200
attacked two nights ago in Amsterdam.
And uh,

267
00:11:48,201 --> 00:11:52,040
there's lots of that going on.
Loads of loads of target selection.

268
00:11:52,380 --> 00:11:54,370
Um,
and uh,

269
00:11:54,371 --> 00:11:56,170
and I think,
I think all this is very,

270
00:11:56,171 --> 00:11:58,750
very worried,
but I do think that in general,

271
00:11:58,751 --> 00:11:59,584
you,
you seem in America to make terrible 

272
00:12:01,721 --> 00:12:02,554
generalization,
to be slightly further down the road of 

273
00:12:04,541 --> 00:12:07,900
certain manias about this.
Um,

274
00:12:07,990 --> 00:12:12,990
it seems to embed itself more this idea 
of being wounded or even hurt by,

275
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:15,490
by,
by words and,

276
00:12:16,630 --> 00:12:17,141
and.
Yeah,

277
00:12:17,141 --> 00:12:20,890
and you've got all of the saw stuff 
slightly worse I think.

278
00:12:21,060 --> 00:12:21,893
Yeah.
Do you think that may be just that in 

279
00:12:24,151 --> 00:12:24,984
and of itself could be just a cultural 
thing that Americans kind of scream 

280
00:12:27,721 --> 00:12:30,120
about things more?
We're a little more hysterical.

281
00:12:30,121 --> 00:12:31,620
You guys are a little more polite.

282
00:12:31,790 --> 00:12:34,700
I was asking a friend in New York about 
this the other day.

283
00:12:35,020 --> 00:12:36,090
Uh,
it's,

284
00:12:36,380 --> 00:12:37,940
I wonder whether the,
you know,

285
00:12:37,941 --> 00:12:39,230
that thing that you always hear in 
America,

286
00:12:39,231 --> 00:12:41,480
this is the most important election of 
our lifetime.

287
00:12:41,510 --> 00:12:44,000
Every single one.
And it's always,

288
00:12:44,001 --> 00:12:44,840
I mean,
by the way,

289
00:12:44,841 --> 00:12:45,674
I'm,
I'm fascinated by the language 

290
00:12:47,330 --> 00:12:48,163
hyperventilation in this country.
And I was fascinated by that moment 

291
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:53,420
before the last election.
My Bill Maher said,

292
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:54,890
look,
we called,

293
00:12:55,190 --> 00:12:56,023
uh,
um,

294
00:12:56,070 --> 00:12:57,290
senator mccain,
the massage.

295
00:12:57,370 --> 00:12:59,690
And so we were just doing it,
try to get him,

296
00:12:59,691 --> 00:13:00,320
and we were like,
no,

297
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:01,460
it wasn't.
And then we did.

298
00:13:01,461 --> 00:13:03,440
They tell on him and then we realized he
wasn't really.

299
00:13:03,460 --> 00:13:05,570
Romney wasn't really misogynist,
but now this guy is.

300
00:13:06,020 --> 00:13:06,853
So I'm fascinated by this thing of 
basically a lot of sort of chickens 

301
00:13:08,631 --> 00:13:09,464
coming home to roost in some ways you,
you kept running the language down and 

302
00:13:12,291 --> 00:13:15,350
now you're in this position.
But I said to this friend in America the

303
00:13:15,351 --> 00:13:17,260
other day,
maybe the,

304
00:13:17,261 --> 00:13:18,230
the,
the as it were,

305
00:13:18,231 --> 00:13:19,064
the hyperventilation of politics is one 
of the ways in which you keep your 

306
00:13:22,761 --> 00:13:23,594
democracy fresh.
We maybe you have to live with that 

307
00:13:26,331 --> 00:13:26,841
pitch.
I mean,

308
00:13:26,841 --> 00:13:30,170
I wouldn't particularly want to live at 
it myself all the time,

309
00:13:30,171 --> 00:13:31,004
but perhaps the kind of this is always 
the most important moment ever is 

310
00:13:35,121 --> 00:13:35,954
important for this democracy.
Maybe it's better than sort of doesn't 

311
00:13:42,201 --> 00:13:44,990
really matter or never going to be as 
good as that.

312
00:13:44,991 --> 00:13:45,280
Again,

313
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:46,113
that's a real.
I'm going to ruminate on that a little 

314
00:13:47,770 --> 00:13:49,510
bit because I think you can argue it 
both ways.

315
00:13:49,511 --> 00:13:51,050
I think.
I mean it's what you're saying.

316
00:13:51,310 --> 00:13:55,180
I can see a problem with that level of 
hysteria all the time.

317
00:13:55,181 --> 00:13:57,520
And you're right when,
when Bill Maher said that,

318
00:13:57,850 --> 00:13:58,451
oh yeah,
yeah.

319
00:13:58,451 --> 00:14:00,490
The left was saying all these horrible 
things about mccain.

320
00:14:00,491 --> 00:14:02,200
We did it about mccain.
We did about romy.

321
00:14:02,350 --> 00:14:03,970
This is the real one.
Well,

322
00:14:03,971 --> 00:14:04,804
you've cried wolf to the point now that.
What did you expect to happen in an odd 

323
00:14:09,791 --> 00:14:10,361
way?
Is that a,

324
00:14:10,361 --> 00:14:13,180
is that a pro trump argument?
Strangely,

325
00:14:13,181 --> 00:14:15,700
like he was of course what was going to 
happen here.

326
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:17,073
You know what I mean?
Like you tried it with you try to have 

327
00:14:18,011 --> 00:14:18,844
some decent sorta center right people,
but of course you're going to get this 

328
00:14:21,641 --> 00:14:21,930
then,

329
00:14:21,930 --> 00:14:23,100
right.
Maybe,

330
00:14:23,130 --> 00:14:24,120
maybe I'm,
I'm,

331
00:14:24,150 --> 00:14:26,260
I'm resistant myself to the,
um,

332
00:14:27,220 --> 00:14:32,160
to introducing Donald Trump told me any 
discussion almost always derails after,

333
00:14:32,161 --> 00:14:32,994
um,
after almost everything that happens in 

334
00:14:34,830 --> 00:14:37,860
the UK in recent,
the last year or so,

335
00:14:38,150 --> 00:14:39,620
say,
well,

336
00:14:39,660 --> 00:14:40,493
how will this affect Donald Trump?
Get stopped talking about to say allow 

337
00:14:43,231 --> 00:14:45,840
other things in the world to exist as 
well.

338
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:46,953
So you're saying when,
I think you're mayor of London was 

339
00:14:49,091 --> 00:14:50,440
saying,
we don't want trump to come here,

340
00:14:50,550 --> 00:14:52,130
you'd be okay if trump showed up.

341
00:14:52,130 --> 00:14:52,963
Right.
I think that's just saying that Donald 

342
00:14:54,950 --> 00:14:57,260
Trump has made an official visit to 
Paris.

343
00:14:57,310 --> 00:14:58,143
Yeah.
He's made official visits to Germany to 

344
00:15:01,940 --> 00:15:02,773
a toilet.
So quite a lot of allied countries by 

345
00:15:05,511 --> 00:15:07,100
now.
I think.

346
00:15:07,101 --> 00:15:07,934
Yeah,
I think it's outrageous and I think 

347
00:15:08,931 --> 00:15:10,820
people should protest if they want to 
protest.

348
00:15:10,821 --> 00:15:13,060
But um,
uh,

349
00:15:13,190 --> 00:15:16,800
and I remember the protests against 
George W dot Bush when he came to London

350
00:15:16,810 --> 00:15:19,820
and during his presidency and there was 
some very,

351
00:15:19,821 --> 00:15:21,740
very vehement protests.
Um,

352
00:15:22,220 --> 00:15:24,670
but I don't mind people protesting,
of course it's a right,

353
00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:27,440
but I just,
I think this attempt to say,

354
00:15:27,441 --> 00:15:28,274
I mean our most important ally and 
particularly an important time in our 

355
00:15:31,521 --> 00:15:32,354
national history in Britain when we need
to be re reforming our alliances and 

356
00:15:36,350 --> 00:15:37,183
renewing them to say f off to the 
president of your closest allies seems 

357
00:15:42,231 --> 00:15:45,920
to me to be very,
very unwise as well as rude.

358
00:15:46,020 --> 00:15:46,853
Yeah.
Is it one of those things where it's 

359
00:15:47,821 --> 00:15:49,770
just,
it's just the easy answer,

360
00:15:49,810 --> 00:15:51,660
you know,
just all that I'm here with a will,

361
00:15:51,710 --> 00:15:53,610
it shows how good we are.
Don't let him hear,

362
00:15:53,790 --> 00:15:54,623
but actually what you do,
you're actually do damage to probably 

363
00:15:57,061 --> 00:16:00,070
the most important relationship that 
these countries have.

364
00:16:00,071 --> 00:16:00,230
Some.

365
00:16:00,230 --> 00:16:02,680
I mean when the mayor of London says we 
don't want him in London.

366
00:16:02,710 --> 00:16:06,250
Yeah.
Well while he's in Paris in Berlin,

367
00:16:06,870 --> 00:16:09,970
like what have you achieved the best you
will,

368
00:16:10,230 --> 00:16:11,063
you'll damage among other things,
the economic relations between Britain 

369
00:16:13,571 --> 00:16:15,280
and America.
So Nice work,

370
00:16:15,281 --> 00:16:16,930
Mr.
Nice work.

371
00:16:17,020 --> 00:16:17,853
Right?
Right.

372
00:16:18,030 --> 00:16:18,641
Uh,
all right,

373
00:16:18,641 --> 00:16:20,200
so we're almost,
we're almost at your book.

374
00:16:20,230 --> 00:16:21,760
So I thought this is the good transition
here.

375
00:16:21,761 --> 00:16:24,130
I was listening to,
I think it was,

376
00:16:24,131 --> 00:16:26,590
you're not your last discussion with Sam
Harris,

377
00:16:26,591 --> 00:16:27,424
maybe the one before that.
And you were guys were talking about 

378
00:16:29,531 --> 00:16:30,364
language and sort of the slow erosion of
what's happening in the west and the 

379
00:16:34,361 --> 00:16:35,740
rise of Islam.
A lot of the,

380
00:16:35,741 --> 00:16:36,574
the key stuff that we all kind of talk 
about and you were talking about how 

381
00:16:39,101 --> 00:16:39,934
we're going to be arguing about gender 
pronouns as all of our rights are going 

382
00:16:44,751 --> 00:16:47,770
to be taken away from us.
You said it far more eloquently and with

383
00:16:47,771 --> 00:16:49,400
some better adjectives.
Uh,

384
00:16:49,401 --> 00:16:52,120
but I thought it was a really 
interesting point that our,

385
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:53,313
our eye is not on the prize in that 
we're not focusing on what's really 

386
00:16:58,271 --> 00:16:59,104
important and we're worried about things
that are not to say trans gender rights 

387
00:17:04,331 --> 00:17:07,570
aren't important,
but they're not the big picture stuff.

388
00:17:07,810 --> 00:17:10,510
How important is all of that?
Focusing on the right things?

389
00:17:11,510 --> 00:17:12,570
I think it's crucial.
I mean,

390
00:17:12,580 --> 00:17:14,990
um,
and people can be interested in whatever

391
00:17:14,991 --> 00:17:15,824
they like,
but I also have the right to tell him I 

392
00:17:17,151 --> 00:17:22,151
think they're wasting their lives.
I'm agender pronouns.

393
00:17:23,420 --> 00:17:24,440
All of this sort of thing.
These,

394
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:26,660
this is there is,
by the way,

395
00:17:26,661 --> 00:17:28,280
behind all this,
something very strange.

396
00:17:28,281 --> 00:17:30,990
I started to notice,
um,

397
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:32,470
that,
uh,

398
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:34,280
all of the fascinating things about 
this,

399
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:37,430
one of the ones that interest me most is
why you get this,

400
00:17:37,460 --> 00:17:38,293
this,
this introduction to almost every 

401
00:17:40,011 --> 00:17:45,011
discussion is if we as human beings are 
sorta solvable things,

402
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:48,073
I find this fascinating.
Most of the Trans stuff is you identify 

403
00:17:52,021 --> 00:17:55,230
that you're the wrong gender at an early
stage.

404
00:17:55,231 --> 00:17:56,910
By the way.
I'm very suspicious about all that.

405
00:17:56,911 --> 00:17:58,170
But,
um,

406
00:17:58,500 --> 00:17:59,333
I think can think of a lot of a feminine
young men who shouldn't have drugs even 

407
00:18:05,371 --> 00:18:06,480
encouraged towards them.

408
00:18:06,550 --> 00:18:07,383
Yeah.
When you say that you mean you're 

409
00:18:08,141 --> 00:18:08,974
suspicious of,
of the way we're treating them or have 

410
00:18:11,021 --> 00:18:12,440
the sort of psychological

411
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:15,180
psych,
the psychological thing in general,

412
00:18:15,181 --> 00:18:16,014
but let's say in a case when somebody 
actually does genuinely feel that they 

413
00:18:18,421 --> 00:18:21,820
are in the wrong body and that there is 
just this awful thing in it.

414
00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:24,080
As in so many other discussions at 
moment of.

415
00:18:24,990 --> 00:18:28,180
And if you mix that you,
um,

416
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:30,420
be on,
you'll be right.

417
00:18:30,930 --> 00:18:32,640
And um,
I think,

418
00:18:32,641 --> 00:18:33,121
no,
no,

419
00:18:33,121 --> 00:18:35,430
no.
Once you sort that out,

420
00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:39,570
you'll face all the same problems 
everyone else faces in their lives.

421
00:18:39,571 --> 00:18:41,790
And maybe some new ones,
but,

422
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:42,720
um,
this,

423
00:18:42,721 --> 00:18:43,554
this is,
I hear this in the race discussion in 

424
00:18:45,271 --> 00:18:46,104
America.
I hear it in the gay discussion in 

425
00:18:47,731 --> 00:18:48,920
America,
in,

426
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:51,930
in a whole set of them.
It's as if it's as if,

427
00:18:51,931 --> 00:18:54,990
if we get the formula right,
I said,

428
00:18:55,010 --> 00:18:55,843
I,
I just think this is a fascinating 

429
00:18:56,791 --> 00:18:58,440
mistake.
Um,

430
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:03,800
I don't think we live our lives as 
solved or solvable beings and um,

431
00:19:05,610 --> 00:19:06,443
and we are,
we are engaged as me in ticketing in 

432
00:19:09,871 --> 00:19:10,704
this society,
in America in this strange attempt to 

433
00:19:12,571 --> 00:19:15,450
sort of get it the minute shy,
right?

434
00:19:17,130 --> 00:19:19,320
And apart from being deeply navel 
gazing,

435
00:19:20,130 --> 00:19:20,963
it seems likely to me that,
that we may be missing all the really 

436
00:19:25,531 --> 00:19:26,364
important things that are going on.
I will have this sort of haunting view 

437
00:19:29,131 --> 00:19:29,964
always that we all feel like we've 
really sorted out every aspect of Lgbtq 

438
00:19:35,490 --> 00:19:40,490
rights just as China becomes the most 
important power in the world.

439
00:19:41,250 --> 00:19:41,970
Very interesting.

440
00:19:41,970 --> 00:19:43,400
Right.
Interesting.

441
00:19:44,450 --> 00:19:48,620
I think it's a fascinating piece because
I was gonna ask.

442
00:19:48,650 --> 00:19:50,660
I was going to talk a little bit more 
about this at the end,

443
00:19:51,020 --> 00:19:51,853
but you're gay and I,
I asked you in our last interview right 

444
00:19:53,871 --> 00:19:56,540
at the end,
by that fact alone,

445
00:19:56,630 --> 00:19:57,463
how much does that give you an extra 
sensitivity to all of the other things 

446
00:20:02,211 --> 00:20:04,460
that you're talking about?
You have a vested interest.

447
00:20:04,580 --> 00:20:07,310
You and I,
and I think all of us,

448
00:20:07,311 --> 00:20:08,144
I think all humans altogether have a 
vested interest in keeping the West 

449
00:20:10,551 --> 00:20:13,580
arrived.
But I think as a gay person,

450
00:20:13,910 --> 00:20:14,743
it's particularly important that the 
last places of tolerance in western 

451
00:20:18,651 --> 00:20:20,060
thought are kept alive.

452
00:20:20,100 --> 00:20:21,480
Yes.
I have to say my own case.

453
00:20:21,481 --> 00:20:24,000
That's not particularly a galvanizing 
thing.

454
00:20:24,001 --> 00:20:25,370
I have to say.
Um,

455
00:20:25,980 --> 00:20:26,813
I mean I think being gay is kind of 
boring as a subject in a way because 

456
00:20:29,611 --> 00:20:32,880
certainly for my generation,
I mean we sort of came out,

457
00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:33,773
came out and buy your $20.
Who wants to keep going on about that a 

458
00:20:37,980 --> 00:20:39,870
little bit and that,
why people did before.

459
00:20:39,871 --> 00:20:40,704
But um,
you is not a career or life as it were 

460
00:20:44,941 --> 00:20:47,070
and just being a gay,
I mean,

461
00:20:47,260 --> 00:20:48,570
not a full time occupation.

462
00:20:48,570 --> 00:20:49,403
Only so many of us can be in reality TV 
know there's only so many fashion gigs 

463
00:20:53,741 --> 00:20:56,290
on Bravo and um,
I,

464
00:20:56,440 --> 00:20:57,280
so I've never,

465
00:20:57,900 --> 00:20:58,733
never.
It's never particularly influenced by 

466
00:21:00,210 --> 00:21:02,910
politics and in fact,
I may have said this to you before,

467
00:21:02,911 --> 00:21:03,500
but I'm,
I'm,

468
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:07,500
I'm generally very opposed to the idea 
of politics being about what am I,

469
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:11,490
myself and how can I get the world to 
most accommodate itself towards me.

470
00:21:12,180 --> 00:21:13,013
Um,
I think it's a mistake having politics 

471
00:21:15,811 --> 00:21:16,644
should be a search for some kind of 
truth or the best arrangement that 

472
00:21:20,221 --> 00:21:23,490
allows the truth to occur.
And you know,

473
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:27,660
your own involvement in either your 
uncomfort in it is of importance,

474
00:21:27,661 --> 00:21:29,090
but it,
I mean,

475
00:21:29,100 --> 00:21:29,933
I wouldn't want somebody to say I'm 
totally into this because I'm fighting 

476
00:21:31,711 --> 00:21:32,910
for myself.
And that's it.

477
00:21:33,090 --> 00:21:33,811
In fact,
by the way,

478
00:21:33,811 --> 00:21:34,644
sorry,
since you mentioned it on some of this 

479
00:21:35,641 --> 00:21:37,110
stuff,
on the Islam stuff,

480
00:21:37,111 --> 00:21:37,944
for instance,
actually the first warning sign to me 

481
00:21:39,601 --> 00:21:43,110
was not a treatment of gays was dreamed 
of Jews,

482
00:21:43,320 --> 00:21:48,320
which I became sort of increasingly 
noticing there was a problem a couple of

483
00:21:48,361 --> 00:21:49,420
decades ago now.
But,

484
00:21:49,421 --> 00:21:51,080
um,
and it was that,

485
00:21:51,370 --> 00:21:53,790
how are you,
how are you seeing in British system?

486
00:21:53,830 --> 00:21:55,240
I was,
I was worried about it because

487
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:56,193
started to notice that there were things
that were being said that I thought 

488
00:21:59,341 --> 00:22:03,810
wouldn't come around again and uh,
I'm not Jewish myself,

489
00:22:03,811 --> 00:22:06,450
but you can,
you can notice these things and um,

490
00:22:06,840 --> 00:22:11,570
and not need to as it were,
have a personal vested interest in,

491
00:22:11,700 --> 00:22:12,521
in it,
you know,

492
00:22:12,521 --> 00:22:13,354
and I mean,
as opposed to one other thing I'd say 

493
00:22:15,811 --> 00:22:18,060
about is I,
I generally think,

494
00:22:18,061 --> 00:22:18,894
I mean,
the atomization of society into groups 

495
00:22:21,271 --> 00:22:24,090
with different interests is one of the 
things that's causing the,

496
00:22:24,091 --> 00:22:27,660
all this mess in America at the moment.
Um,

497
00:22:28,260 --> 00:22:29,093
I don't see why the job of gays should 
be just to sort of fight for the gays 

498
00:22:33,031 --> 00:22:35,010
and the job of the Jews would be a fight
for the Jews and,

499
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:37,070
and so on and so forth.
Uh,

500
00:22:37,071 --> 00:22:39,840
I think,
I think the idea was sort of looking out

501
00:22:39,841 --> 00:22:42,540
for each other's shortly,
the point in a republic.

502
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:45,750
And yet that point seems to be lost,

503
00:22:45,950 --> 00:22:47,190
right?
So is that where this,

504
00:22:47,191 --> 00:22:51,950
this intersectional crew has really lost
it because they are sort of getting what

505
00:22:51,951 --> 00:22:55,400
you're saying that we should be looking 
out for each other that should bring all

506
00:22:55,401 --> 00:22:59,360
of these minority groups together,
except instead of that they're vying for

507
00:22:59,361 --> 00:23:00,510
most depressed,

508
00:23:01,260 --> 00:23:02,093
uh,
and most ridiculous and most 

509
00:23:04,631 --> 00:23:07,930
hyperventilating and all of that.
But the intersectionality people,

510
00:23:07,931 --> 00:23:08,764
I mean the two big things,
one is they are the prime culprits of 

511
00:23:12,031 --> 00:23:14,140
this thing,
of the myth of Solvability,

512
00:23:14,300 --> 00:23:16,430
the myth of humans eligibility.
If we just,

513
00:23:16,540 --> 00:23:18,430
if we get the Rubik's cube right and 
okay,

514
00:23:18,431 --> 00:23:21,280
the Games get that and then we get the 
traumas and then the people to hand them

515
00:23:21,281 --> 00:23:22,600
the nonbinary in this and

516
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:26,753
exactly think exactly the same and speak
in exactly the preferential order that 

517
00:23:30,631 --> 00:23:32,400
we're loud speaking.
It will all be fine.

518
00:23:32,430 --> 00:23:33,263
Whereas my view is you'll still have 
every single problem of the world ahead 

519
00:23:35,761 --> 00:23:36,594
of you.
You'll still have to work out what your 

520
00:23:37,801 --> 00:23:41,370
foreign policy is.
A whole load of stuff is coming.

521
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:42,480
But.
So that's,

522
00:23:42,540 --> 00:23:43,373
that's the first thing.
But the second thing is they are 

523
00:23:44,701 --> 00:23:46,040
obviously apart

524
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:46,873
in American society.
I don't think that's too much of an 

525
00:23:48,741 --> 00:23:49,574
exaggeration because they started at the
universities and it's trickling across 

526
00:23:52,431 --> 00:23:53,264
everything else and I've been having 
really interesting conversations with 

527
00:23:56,361 --> 00:23:57,194
people about this in recent years in 
Europe as well as in America and one of 

528
00:24:02,301 --> 00:24:03,134
the things I'm sort of slightly 
confident about here in America is it 

529
00:24:05,541 --> 00:24:09,770
you do have an answer to it and it's an 
answer you've had before.

530
00:24:09,771 --> 00:24:10,604
You know,
the problem of the identity politics 

531
00:24:12,021 --> 00:24:17,021
thing is we're already starting to see a
the apart from being wrong in itself and

532
00:24:17,330 --> 00:24:20,900
I think morally suspicious.
I'm selfish.

533
00:24:22,430 --> 00:24:24,740
You can't stop what you're going to 
create on it.

534
00:24:24,980 --> 00:24:28,910
You can't have racial rights for every 
group and racial pride rights,

535
00:24:28,911 --> 00:24:32,870
every group and always hold back white,
you know,

536
00:24:32,990 --> 00:24:34,130
pride,
whatever.

537
00:24:34,660 --> 00:24:35,840
You just,
you just can't.

538
00:24:35,841 --> 00:24:36,674
At some point it's going to break.
You can't keep bashing heterosexual men 

539
00:24:40,670 --> 00:24:41,503
and not expect at some point that 
there's going to be some kind of 

540
00:24:45,050 --> 00:24:45,590
response.

541
00:24:45,590 --> 00:24:49,640
So if everyone's allowed their group 
apart from the majority or whatever,

542
00:24:49,641 --> 00:24:50,474
then at some point that's going to get 
nasty and I can see it coming so 

543
00:24:53,211 --> 00:24:54,044
clearly.
We see it now and it's already started 

544
00:24:56,300 --> 00:25:01,300
and um,
the thing is that in America you had the

545
00:25:02,091 --> 00:25:05,830
answer to this,
which is what Tocqueville a mentioned.

546
00:25:05,970 --> 00:25:09,200
It's the deal of being in the republic 
is you don't do that.

547
00:25:09,201 --> 00:25:12,290
You,
you deal with each other face to face to

548
00:25:12,291 --> 00:25:16,850
face as a citizens.
You don't,

549
00:25:16,910 --> 00:25:20,300
you don't do it as just people coming to
hawk,

550
00:25:20,301 --> 00:25:24,450
something in the marketplace,
but face to faces,

551
00:25:24,500 --> 00:25:26,720
individual citizens in the republic.
And this,

552
00:25:27,560 --> 00:25:30,540
this is the only way out.
Um,

553
00:25:30,650 --> 00:25:35,000
but I think there will obviously be some
mania before you get back there again.

554
00:25:35,810 --> 00:25:36,441
You know,
it's funny,

555
00:25:36,441 --> 00:25:37,274
you get the,
may you get back mainly business our 

556
00:25:40,221 --> 00:25:41,230
may,
uh,

557
00:25:41,330 --> 00:25:42,500
you know,
it's funny the way I do the show,

558
00:25:42,501 --> 00:25:43,334
I try not to talk about individual 
people too much because I'd always 

559
00:25:45,770 --> 00:25:47,150
rather focus on the ideas.

560
00:25:47,510 --> 00:25:48,343
But as you're saying this,
I'm thinking of something very 

561
00:25:49,491 --> 00:25:52,210
specifically that Linda Sarsour who I'm 
sure you're.

562
00:25:52,220 --> 00:25:53,053
No,
I spent an evening with us also in 

563
00:25:54,171 --> 00:25:55,330
Brooklyn.
Really?

564
00:25:55,540 --> 00:25:56,300
Yeah.
Yeah.

565
00:25:56,300 --> 00:25:58,320
Can I,
I'd tell you,

566
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:04,000
we got on roaring.
Lee and I sent some territory that was a

567
00:26:04,911 --> 00:26:07,530
bit of sexual tension in the room and 
uh,

568
00:26:07,620 --> 00:26:09,200
avoidable,
but no,

569
00:26:09,201 --> 00:26:09,871
the,
uh,

570
00:26:09,871 --> 00:26:11,690
uh,
the fact is actually she,

571
00:26:11,691 --> 00:26:12,524
um,
we're asked to debate the CROC fandom 

572
00:26:14,721 --> 00:26:17,420
word Islamophobia at the Brooklyn Art 
Museum.

573
00:26:17,421 --> 00:26:21,170
And I like a challenge and uh,
um,

574
00:26:21,260 --> 00:26:22,550
I think our mutual friend,
lion has.

575
00:26:22,551 --> 00:26:24,140
Jada was also meant to be there,
but I,

576
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:25,610
but,
uh,

577
00:26:25,730 --> 00:26:26,600
oh,
um,

578
00:26:26,660 --> 00:26:30,500
various things happened.
The garland shooting happened and it was

579
00:26:30,501 --> 00:26:34,730
decided that it wasn't safe a yarn.
I still did it and things.

580
00:26:34,731 --> 00:26:35,511
But uh,
yeah,

581
00:26:35,511 --> 00:26:36,344
the whole thing that they started off 
with the other side sort of giggling 

582
00:26:37,791 --> 00:26:40,160
about the fact that they couldn't even 
turn up,

583
00:26:40,161 --> 00:26:43,100
you know,
it was all using it against her and as I

584
00:26:43,101 --> 00:26:44,220
ions afraid of anybody

585
00:26:45,700 --> 00:26:47,720
and yeah.
And I say yes.

586
00:26:47,721 --> 00:26:49,860
I encountered him before she became,
as it were,

587
00:26:49,861 --> 00:26:53,790
infamous,
and I thought she was a very nasty,

588
00:26:53,970 --> 00:26:56,860
very bitter,
very on America.

589
00:26:56,861 --> 00:26:57,920
And actually,
um,

590
00:26:57,960 --> 00:26:59,250
uh,
I just say that because she,

591
00:26:59,460 --> 00:27:00,293
she knows like all demagogues,
how to introduce herself and introduced 

592
00:27:03,091 --> 00:27:06,060
herself to sort of proud brooklynite,
proud American and a proud Palestinian,

593
00:27:06,061 --> 00:27:06,720
et cetera,
et cetera.

594
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:11,720
And I thought an interesting order,
but it was clear that she sort of really

595
00:27:12,060 --> 00:27:12,893
hated America or at least hates America 
that exists currently because it was me 

596
00:27:16,981 --> 00:27:19,740
that ended up having to explain to the 
audience that for instance,

597
00:27:19,770 --> 00:27:23,820
the New York police don't just go around
persecuting Muslims,

598
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:27,320
you know,
it just willful misrepresentation of,

599
00:27:27,910 --> 00:27:30,350
of the American authorities at every 
turn.

600
00:27:30,700 --> 00:27:33,150
So I thought she was very dishonest,
very unpleasant.

601
00:27:33,570 --> 00:27:35,880
And,
but I mean I've come across her type all

602
00:27:35,881 --> 00:27:36,470
my life.

603
00:27:36,470 --> 00:27:37,303
Yeah.
And the only reason I mentioned her is 

604
00:27:38,421 --> 00:27:42,120
because of what you said previously,
which really was about assimilation,

605
00:27:42,170 --> 00:27:44,700
that the whole point of America is to 
assimilate.

606
00:27:44,730 --> 00:27:45,563
I don't know if you saw that speech she 
gave about two months ago where she 

607
00:27:47,691 --> 00:27:48,524
called for a g high and then suddenly 
the left was defending the word gi and 

608
00:27:51,681 --> 00:27:54,800
the white supremacists in the White 
House and all that.

609
00:27:54,890 --> 00:27:57,620
But I thought the key part of it put 
jihad aside,

610
00:27:57,860 --> 00:28:01,040
put white supremacy aside.
The key part was when she said,

611
00:28:01,041 --> 00:28:04,460
we're not here to assimilate thought 
what a,

612
00:28:04,730 --> 00:28:07,760
that is the antithesis of the American 
project,

613
00:28:07,790 --> 00:28:11,890
this amazing melting pot that we have 
where we've done for the most part,

614
00:28:11,900 --> 00:28:13,030
multicultural,
right.

615
00:28:13,070 --> 00:28:14,210
Multiculturalism,
right?

616
00:28:14,211 --> 00:28:16,490
Where Europe has failed in a lot of 
ways.

617
00:28:16,491 --> 00:28:17,900
And she was saying,
no,

618
00:28:18,020 --> 00:28:18,261
no,
no,

619
00:28:18,261 --> 00:28:19,094
absolutely.
And I thought that was more dangerous 

620
00:28:20,211 --> 00:28:21,170
than the others.
Absolutely.

621
00:28:21,171 --> 00:28:21,941
Of course.
I mean,

622
00:28:21,941 --> 00:28:22,551
yeah,
as you say about him,

623
00:28:22,551 --> 00:28:23,281
he put aside.
Yeah.

624
00:28:23,281 --> 00:28:25,880
The fantastical idea of what she was 
suggesting was,

625
00:28:25,881 --> 00:28:26,900
you know,
you sort of have a,

626
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:30,200
a jihad by kind of going and just really
in a struggling.

627
00:28:30,380 --> 00:28:34,160
And I'm just struggling in front of this
Israeli.

628
00:28:34,390 --> 00:28:37,730
I'm having a timeline.
Yeah.

629
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:38,900
Um,
that,

630
00:28:38,930 --> 00:28:39,920
uh,
yeah.

631
00:28:39,921 --> 00:28:41,720
This is,
this is what I recognize is the night we

632
00:28:41,721 --> 00:28:42,171
met.
I mean,

633
00:28:42,171 --> 00:28:45,590
she really doesn't like this country,
by the way.

634
00:28:45,591 --> 00:28:46,930
I mean,
we will have a problem by that.

635
00:28:46,931 --> 00:28:48,710
It was what you,
what you do about that.

636
00:28:48,800 --> 00:28:50,750
Um,
uh,

637
00:28:50,751 --> 00:28:51,584
it seems to me she's a sort of very 
rabid sectarian sort of Palestinian 

638
00:28:55,581 --> 00:28:57,470
nationalist who happens to live in 
Brooklyn.

639
00:28:58,670 --> 00:28:59,503
I'm a,
but I mean really what you do about it 

640
00:29:02,121 --> 00:29:04,730
is that people identified that recognize
it and called it out 40.

641
00:29:04,750 --> 00:29:08,630
It was what it is and they just aren't 
very many people to do that.

642
00:29:08,631 --> 00:29:09,670
So I mean,
you know,

643
00:29:09,810 --> 00:29:12,920
we all take sort of baby steps on this.
Don't we know is you say,

644
00:29:12,940 --> 00:29:16,170
you know,
you end up with a left or defending this

645
00:29:16,610 --> 00:29:17,870
and actually why don't you just say,
look,

646
00:29:17,930 --> 00:29:18,763
she's not speaking as a critic of our 
society who wants to sort of mildly 

647
00:29:23,900 --> 00:29:24,733
improve it.
She's speaking as an opponent of our 

648
00:29:26,371 --> 00:29:30,950
society because she doesn't like it.
Now I've encountered this,

649
00:29:30,951 --> 00:29:31,784
I say all my life and my opponents and 
the very close enemies I've made in 

650
00:29:35,330 --> 00:29:40,250
Britain and across Europe,
a certain type of person of that ilk who

651
00:29:40,670 --> 00:29:44,110
clearly as an opponent of the society,
they don't like it.

652
00:29:44,710 --> 00:29:46,790
And of course,
among other things,

653
00:29:46,791 --> 00:29:49,420
or you can do is point a to point out 
then is to say,

654
00:29:49,910 --> 00:29:50,520
you know,
amazing

655
00:29:50,520 --> 00:29:53,340
your hair really,
isn't it amazing?

656
00:29:53,790 --> 00:29:54,623
Yeah.
And that's the catch 22 of what we've 

657
00:29:56,701 --> 00:29:57,960
got in the west,
right,

658
00:29:57,961 --> 00:30:00,480
where we're going to have to let in all 
sorts of voices.

659
00:30:00,481 --> 00:30:01,860
That's,
that's the beauty of this thing.

660
00:30:01,861 --> 00:30:04,270
And it also creates a little bit of the 
brand.

661
00:30:04,350 --> 00:30:06,600
All right,
let's talk about your book.

662
00:30:06,900 --> 00:30:08,220
First off,
I love the title,

663
00:30:08,280 --> 00:30:09,113
the strange death of Europe.
I thought using the adjective strange 

664
00:30:13,110 --> 00:30:16,440
was particularly interesting.
Why didn't you choose the word strange,

665
00:30:16,441 --> 00:30:21,441
not slow or a series of other things 
that you could have used first is,

666
00:30:22,710 --> 00:30:27,000
which not many readers will get to a 
slightly known history textbook.

667
00:30:27,001 --> 00:30:28,860
I've got strange death of liberal 
England,

668
00:30:29,040 --> 00:30:29,873
which described the decline of the 
Liberal Party in the early part of the 

669
00:30:32,401 --> 00:30:33,690
20th century.
But there's no sort of,

670
00:30:33,750 --> 00:30:34,900
isn't needed it,
it was.

671
00:30:34,901 --> 00:30:35,220
No,
it.

672
00:30:35,220 --> 00:30:37,550
Although there is a slight similarity.
Um,

673
00:30:38,030 --> 00:30:39,180
yeah.
Is a really a viral thing.

674
00:30:39,181 --> 00:30:39,830
Is,
is just.

675
00:30:39,830 --> 00:30:42,240
It is odd.
I mean it's,

676
00:30:42,270 --> 00:30:45,240
it's a curious way to go.
Um,

677
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:50,190
and I think if you'd have said to anyone
have one or two generations ago,

678
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:55,860
this will be what Europe's issues would 
be in the 21st century that basically it

679
00:30:55,861 --> 00:30:56,694
couldn't,
couldn't find any way not to just allow 

680
00:31:00,001 --> 00:31:03,910
the world to walk in and join them that,
um,

681
00:31:04,500 --> 00:31:05,333
that,
those generations would have been 

682
00:31:06,061 --> 00:31:08,650
surprised.
And uh,

683
00:31:08,651 --> 00:31:10,350
so yes it is,
it is strange.

684
00:31:10,351 --> 00:31:12,650
It's a night,
but I tried to explain why and I,

685
00:31:12,651 --> 00:31:15,300
and in order to explain it,
I tried to explain it from not just from

686
00:31:15,301 --> 00:31:16,170
the,
you know,

687
00:31:16,180 --> 00:31:19,680
the sort of firsthand accounts and the 
statistics and all that sort of thing,

688
00:31:19,681 --> 00:31:22,470
but,
but the deeper philosophical reasons why

689
00:31:22,471 --> 00:31:23,304
this is happening,
I think that's lots of books do bits of 

690
00:31:28,440 --> 00:31:30,090
that,
but I want to just say,

691
00:31:30,091 --> 00:31:31,890
look,
this is the whole overall picture.

692
00:31:31,890 --> 00:31:32,723
This is,
this is what we're actually living 

693
00:31:34,321 --> 00:31:36,240
through and this is why.

694
00:31:36,430 --> 00:31:37,263
Yeah.
So the subtitle is immigration identity 

695
00:31:40,930 --> 00:31:42,680
and Islam.
Uh,

696
00:31:43,330 --> 00:31:46,840
does that order have any meaning to you 
in the way you phrase those?

697
00:31:47,270 --> 00:31:47,400
It,

698
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:47,961
Kelly?
I mean,

699
00:31:47,961 --> 00:31:48,794
it,
it centers on the 2015 migration crisis 

700
00:31:52,220 --> 00:31:54,320
when Angela Merkel opened the doors of 
Europe and,

701
00:31:54,970 --> 00:31:55,803
um,
couldn't really find a way to shut them 

702
00:31:56,751 --> 00:31:57,750
again.
Um,

703
00:31:58,100 --> 00:32:01,630
but they'd already been open for a long 
time as I explained.

704
00:32:02,090 --> 00:32:03,870
I'm no,
I mean it's,

705
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:04,970
uh,
these,

706
00:32:05,030 --> 00:32:07,380
these are the three massive things that,
uh,

707
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:08,233
that,
uh,

708
00:32:08,450 --> 00:32:10,310
that are preoccupying I think not just 
Europe,

709
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:12,890
Europeans at the moment,
the immigration crisis,

710
00:32:12,900 --> 00:32:17,150
whether publics of Europe just wanted to
stop all across the continent.

711
00:32:17,180 --> 00:32:21,710
All the polls all show the same thing.
The public wanted to slow down or stop.

712
00:32:22,430 --> 00:32:24,440
Uh,
so that's the immigration better at the,

713
00:32:24,500 --> 00:32:27,740
uh,
identity bit of it is a very,

714
00:32:27,741 --> 00:32:29,120
very painful thing.
Which,

715
00:32:29,121 --> 00:32:29,954
you know,
people aren't very good at talking 

716
00:32:31,191 --> 00:32:32,930
about.
Maybe I'm not very good at talking about

717
00:32:32,931 --> 00:32:33,764
it,
but I think it's just their underlying 

718
00:32:35,121 --> 00:32:37,430
everything.
What is this thing?

719
00:32:37,430 --> 00:32:42,020
What is it a European who,
who can be European?

720
00:32:42,500 --> 00:32:43,333
Can anyone be a.
and is Europe a home for the people 

721
00:32:48,260 --> 00:32:49,093
who've been in Europe or is it for 
anyone in the world he wants to move in 

722
00:32:52,071 --> 00:32:54,890
and call it home is a very,
very big question.

723
00:32:55,210 --> 00:32:56,043
These are big.
And then the third one of that is the 

724
00:32:57,471 --> 00:32:58,304
Islam,
but which I mentioned because it's 

725
00:33:00,051 --> 00:33:03,040
obviously the sharp has specified.
There's a,

726
00:33:03,140 --> 00:33:07,820
you can have somebody move in.
I know you can have a Nigerian Christian

727
00:33:07,821 --> 00:33:10,040
move into a,
um,

728
00:33:10,110 --> 00:33:10,943
a bit of the south of England and uh,
they will have issues I bring as 

729
00:33:13,971 --> 00:33:14,804
everyone does.
They will have their own ideas as 

730
00:33:15,681 --> 00:33:16,514
everyone does their own culture that 
they've walked in from and everyone 

731
00:33:19,101 --> 00:33:20,400
does.
Um,

732
00:33:20,530 --> 00:33:21,540
but,
uh,

733
00:33:21,590 --> 00:33:22,423
it would be the person of another 
background for another community and 

734
00:33:27,191 --> 00:33:32,191
another faith who would be coming in 
with the issues that are really starting

735
00:33:33,081 --> 00:33:34,520
to northern Europe.

736
00:33:35,030 --> 00:33:36,200
We,
um,

737
00:33:36,350 --> 00:33:39,670
we find this very hard to talk about and
uh,

738
00:33:39,680 --> 00:33:40,120
it,
it,

739
00:33:40,120 --> 00:33:42,530
it's getting easier very,
very slowly.

740
00:33:43,130 --> 00:33:43,881
But,
you know,

741
00:33:43,881 --> 00:33:47,330
our big worry is we've not been great on
the integration.

742
00:33:47,430 --> 00:33:48,263
All of our leaders say this,
all the European politicians admit this 

743
00:33:51,411 --> 00:33:55,610
now,
but the bit that is worrying us is Islam

744
00:33:55,611 --> 00:33:56,444
bit because I think there's now a 
general awareness that may be this is 

745
00:33:59,391 --> 00:34:00,224
the bit we can't digest or we're finding
it unusually difficult to digest and 

746
00:34:06,741 --> 00:34:10,220
incorporate A.
I don't say it's impossible by the way.

747
00:34:10,221 --> 00:34:11,054
I just think for all sorts of reasons.
It's proving very hard in May in the 

748
00:34:14,260 --> 00:34:15,680
years ahead proved far worse.

749
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:20,800
So I know that you often make the 
distinction like most educated people,

750
00:34:20,841 --> 00:34:23,960
you make the distinction between Islam 
as a set of ideas,

751
00:34:24,170 --> 00:34:28,670
as any religion is simply a set of ideas
versus Muslim as as possible.

752
00:34:29,090 --> 00:34:29,923
In this case,
do you think that there is something 

753
00:34:32,511 --> 00:34:33,344
unique?
I mean this is always what triggers my 

754
00:34:34,611 --> 00:34:35,444
friends on the left.
If you say that there is something 

755
00:34:36,741 --> 00:34:41,741
unique about the set of ideas of Islam 
that is different than the set of ideas.

756
00:34:43,161 --> 00:34:46,100
If we just take the big three 
monotheistic once that is different than

757
00:34:46,101 --> 00:34:46,934
the set of ideas of Judaism or 
Christianity or at least how their 

758
00:34:49,881 --> 00:34:50,714
practice I think is the more operative 
part because you can look through all 

759
00:34:53,331 --> 00:34:55,410
the books and there's plenty of bad 
stuff in the old testament.

760
00:34:55,420 --> 00:34:56,630
Okay.
Um,

761
00:34:57,710 --> 00:34:59,870
do you at the,
at the end of this,

762
00:34:59,871 --> 00:35:00,704
do you believe that it's just 
incompatible that this set of ideas is 

763
00:35:03,891 --> 00:35:08,570
incompatible with the set of ideas that 
the west is trying to preserve?

764
00:35:08,620 --> 00:35:12,790
I think,
I think unreformed Islam presents a very

765
00:35:12,791 --> 00:35:17,190
significant values challenge and it's 
probably not reconcilable if,

766
00:35:17,270 --> 00:35:18,580
if we have,
as it were,

767
00:35:18,581 --> 00:35:19,990
the Islam of,
uh,

768
00:35:20,050 --> 00:35:25,050
most Muslim countries,
it's very hard to see how that's doable.

769
00:35:26,170 --> 00:35:27,940
Um,
uh,

770
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:30,550
I think all of this is very painful,
isn't it?

771
00:35:30,551 --> 00:35:31,384
Because first of all,
we live in any case in an age of 

772
00:35:32,831 --> 00:35:36,490
relativism already were for perfectly 
good reasons.

773
00:35:36,491 --> 00:35:37,091
Sometimes,
you know,

774
00:35:37,091 --> 00:35:38,910
we sort of pretend there's all sorts of 
the same,

775
00:35:38,911 --> 00:35:39,744
you know,
like I,

776
00:35:39,930 --> 00:35:42,360
I might be a Muslim,
you know,

777
00:35:42,390 --> 00:35:43,223
you might be a Christian,
she does yoga and it all comes out in 

778
00:35:47,281 --> 00:35:48,114
the wash.
Pretty much the same and I just think 

779
00:35:49,621 --> 00:35:52,020
that to begin with,
that's obviously not true.

780
00:35:52,021 --> 00:35:52,854
I mean it's very strange to,
to want to concentrate on everything 

781
00:35:56,880 --> 00:36:00,180
other than the premises and origins of a
belief structure.

782
00:36:01,120 --> 00:36:02,850
Um,
and as I've often said,

783
00:36:02,851 --> 00:36:04,340
stop me if I've said this to you before,
but I mean,

784
00:36:04,890 --> 00:36:05,723
you know,
there are all sorts of problems in the 

785
00:36:06,481 --> 00:36:09,060
Christian religion and in Christian 
history,

786
00:36:09,061 --> 00:36:11,310
but as I've often said,
you know what,

787
00:36:11,311 --> 00:36:15,420
I'm just carrying out the thought 
experiment that instead of getting up at

788
00:36:15,421 --> 00:36:16,800
the sermon on the mount and saying,
you know,

789
00:36:16,801 --> 00:36:18,390
love they neighbor and you know,
forgive me,

790
00:36:18,391 --> 00:36:19,050
we're endlessly.

791
00:36:19,050 --> 00:36:21,360
Jesus had said,
if your brother offends you,

792
00:36:21,361 --> 00:36:22,194
chop his head off.
Would Christianity's history have been 

793
00:36:24,031 --> 00:36:24,864
more bloody or less bloody.
I think we'd all agree it's going to be 

794
00:36:26,311 --> 00:36:29,090
more and find the job behind the tree.
Yeah,

795
00:36:29,100 --> 00:36:29,933
if Jesus had gone,
but if Jesus had gone into the whole 

796
00:36:34,381 --> 00:36:34,870
like,
fine,

797
00:36:34,870 --> 00:36:36,690
you know,
the behind the train slaughter him,

798
00:36:37,810 --> 00:36:40,520
um,
whatever the context,

799
00:36:40,620 --> 00:36:41,453
right?
And then there would be even more 

800
00:36:46,120 --> 00:36:50,820
Christian antisemitism and then there 
has been historically.

801
00:36:50,821 --> 00:36:55,650
So I just think these things matter and 
all this is very,

802
00:36:55,651 --> 00:36:59,130
very painful for reasons that I go in 
during some depth in the book,

803
00:36:59,131 --> 00:37:03,000
which is that in recent years we,
in countries like Britain and I think in

804
00:37:03,001 --> 00:37:07,400
America have had the luxury of sort of 
describing ourselves in terms of,

805
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:11,580
among other things have been universal,
but what we have,

806
00:37:11,650 --> 00:37:13,140
it should also be universal.

807
00:37:13,140 --> 00:37:13,973
Now this is a very big,
this is always a debate within 

808
00:37:15,230 --> 00:37:18,090
liberalism of course is liberalism,
something we have or something we,

809
00:37:18,091 --> 00:37:19,450
as it were,
expound and,

810
00:37:19,451 --> 00:37:20,284
and,
and,

811
00:37:20,470 --> 00:37:22,620
and expand.
Um,

812
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:23,873
and in recent years I think that a 
certain moroseness has landed across 

813
00:37:28,711 --> 00:37:31,200
Europe,
among other things,

814
00:37:31,500 --> 00:37:33,660
uh,
because of a growing awareness.

815
00:37:33,690 --> 00:37:34,523
Maybe what we have is very unusual and 
that we have become disassociated from 

816
00:37:41,071 --> 00:37:46,071
the roots in which,
what we enjoy a group and this,

817
00:37:46,270 --> 00:37:47,470
this is a problem.
There's a,

818
00:37:47,490 --> 00:37:48,810
uh,
German uh,

819
00:37:48,840 --> 00:37:50,100
uh,
legal ferris,

820
00:37:50,101 --> 00:37:50,934
I quote in the book,
who puts this as one of the central 

821
00:37:53,341 --> 00:37:55,200
conundrum for Europe.
Is it possible?

822
00:37:56,010 --> 00:37:56,843
Is it possible that the thing we're 
enjoying and living through a can 

823
00:38:00,811 --> 00:38:03,660
survive without the connection to its 
roots?

824
00:38:03,900 --> 00:38:06,510
And I,
I believe that the roots of the West and

825
00:38:06,511 --> 00:38:11,511
of Europe in particular fairly clear and
it's a combination of things.

826
00:38:11,820 --> 00:38:15,000
It's the inheritance from ancient Greece
and ancient Rome.

827
00:38:15,630 --> 00:38:16,463
It's obviously the inheritance of the 
Christian civilization that washed 

828
00:38:18,991 --> 00:38:20,370
through the,
throughout the continent.

829
00:38:20,940 --> 00:38:21,773
And then the refining fire,
the enlightenments and skepticism and 

830
00:38:24,990 --> 00:38:25,823
all these things.
And of course we would go on endlessly 

831
00:38:27,421 --> 00:38:28,890
about the other things that have added 
to it.

832
00:38:28,891 --> 00:38:32,070
But broadly speaking,
that is what made Europe Europe and what

833
00:38:32,071 --> 00:38:34,880
made a European a European.
They breathe this,

834
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:35,793
this,
uh,

835
00:38:36,580 --> 00:38:37,820
um,
but,

836
00:38:37,880 --> 00:38:38,713
but,
but the sort of the last man at the end 

837
00:38:40,180 --> 00:38:44,200
of that,
which I fear modern Europeans are,

838
00:38:44,220 --> 00:38:45,053
is,
is in this strange position of I'm 

839
00:38:47,830 --> 00:38:52,390
finding it hard to even identify where 
he and she has coming from,

840
00:38:52,391 --> 00:38:56,260
let alone being able to return to those 
roots and nurture them.

841
00:38:56,470 --> 00:38:57,790
Because we all have,
I have,

842
00:38:57,791 --> 00:39:00,700
I'm sure you have a conflicted set of 
views about this,

843
00:39:01,720 --> 00:39:03,370
um,
you know,

844
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:08,400
is it necessary for other people to 
believe those of us who had,

845
00:39:08,430 --> 00:39:09,263
who,
who have sometimes been tempted to hope 

846
00:39:10,901 --> 00:39:11,711
that,
for instance,

847
00:39:11,711 --> 00:39:12,544
skepticism is enough constantly a 
depressed by the discovery that for 

848
00:39:17,351 --> 00:39:20,530
instance,
somebody may be a free thinker about God

849
00:39:21,250 --> 00:39:24,010
and that's it for free thinking point of
view.

850
00:39:24,011 --> 00:39:27,400
Yeah.
From then on it's tribal away and um,

851
00:39:28,120 --> 00:39:29,470
you know,
we're all,

852
00:39:29,650 --> 00:39:32,320
we're all living through this,
but it's for Europe.

853
00:39:32,321 --> 00:39:33,154
I think that the combination of a 
historically unprecedented move into 

854
00:39:37,421 --> 00:39:38,254
people in the continent at the same time
that this sort of breakdown of what we 

855
00:39:43,211 --> 00:39:46,930
are ourselves is going on is a,
is a fatal,

856
00:39:47,080 --> 00:39:47,913
fatal thing.

857
00:39:48,370 --> 00:39:50,560
So there's a lot there that I want to 
hit.

858
00:39:50,561 --> 00:39:52,570
But I was what you said right at the 
beginning,

859
00:39:52,571 --> 00:39:57,040
which is that if Islam,
if unreformed or not allowed to reform.

860
00:39:57,520 --> 00:40:02,110
So I think that's particularly 
interesting for the space that you and I

861
00:40:02,410 --> 00:40:06,970
sort of exist in because I've many 
allies who are reformers.

862
00:40:07,140 --> 00:40:09,250
I'm not just so I have allies that are 
ex Muslim,

863
00:40:09,251 --> 00:40:10,084
I have allies that are Muslim and many,
many people that I've interviewed that 

864
00:40:12,851 --> 00:40:15,460
you know,
but they're are treated horribly,

865
00:40:16,240 --> 00:40:17,073
horribly and there and every time 
they're allowed to get a platform or 

866
00:40:20,700 --> 00:40:21,533
it's actually by the evil conservatives 
were all the things that people who 

867
00:40:26,441 --> 00:40:27,274
don't like me,
you'll say about me or say about you or 

868
00:40:28,511 --> 00:40:32,190
any of that stuff that makes the job a 
good jillion times harder.

869
00:40:32,470 --> 00:40:33,303
I say in the book towards the end when I
tried to rouse myself some 

870
00:40:35,741 --> 00:40:39,970
prognostications about all this,
that this is the worst possible sign.

871
00:40:41,170 --> 00:40:42,003
I'm not just that the people that we 
might talk about in these terms are so 

872
00:40:45,131 --> 00:40:45,964
few and between us,
you and I might have them in our phone 

873
00:40:48,941 --> 00:40:51,640
books.
Not just that,

874
00:40:51,790 --> 00:40:54,350
but who were the ones that are most 
under,

875
00:40:55,030 --> 00:40:58,490
under pressure and under risk.
They really are the,

876
00:40:58,540 --> 00:41:03,540
they're the good guys to say that this 
is a tragedy for Islam is obvious,

877
00:41:04,720 --> 00:41:05,553
but he's always been my view that we 
should try to avoid making ourselves a 

878
00:41:08,891 --> 00:41:11,050
casualty of Islams,
civil,

879
00:41:11,110 --> 00:41:13,480
internal strife.
And,

880
00:41:13,481 --> 00:41:14,650
uh,
I think we haven't done that.

881
00:41:14,651 --> 00:41:15,484
I think we've spent recent decades 
almost deliberately running towards the 

882
00:41:17,921 --> 00:41:18,754
fight.
Didn't need to involve us so that the 

883
00:41:21,401 --> 00:41:24,730
tragedy of Islam becomes the tragedy of 
the West as well.

884
00:41:24,730 --> 00:41:27,160
I hope this could be avoided,
but I think it calmed.

885
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:28,833
And I think that as I say,
the worst possible sign for the future 

886
00:41:31,870 --> 00:41:33,410
is that it's a,
you know,

887
00:41:33,470 --> 00:41:34,303
having dabbled summit in Germany who 
lives under protection measure no wise 

888
00:41:37,701 --> 00:41:38,534
who comes in for the grief in the UK.
It's a young cle who followed the Dutch 

889
00:41:42,350 --> 00:41:46,520
integration ideal more than anyone who 
ends up having to leave Holland.

890
00:41:47,220 --> 00:41:49,280
These are very,
very bad signs,

891
00:41:49,281 --> 00:41:51,230
you know,
you can still live openly as a,

892
00:41:51,240 --> 00:41:53,690
you know,
Hammer has military commander in London.

893
00:41:54,030 --> 00:41:57,620
Your life's fine.
You'll be celebrated in some ways,

894
00:41:58,020 --> 00:41:59,390
right?
I mean this is a huge trump.

895
00:41:59,420 --> 00:42:00,253
All right,
so let's,

896
00:42:00,380 --> 00:42:01,213
let's knock out each one of these words.
We've sort of hit that I think a bit of 

897
00:42:03,741 --> 00:42:04,574
each one already on the immigration 
front when you said that Merkel just 

898
00:42:07,761 --> 00:42:08,660
opened the doors.

899
00:42:09,530 --> 00:42:14,330
I see a lot of different stuff written 
about her that she either intentionally,

900
00:42:14,331 --> 00:42:15,164
you know,
you get sort of the conspiracy people 

901
00:42:16,371 --> 00:42:17,204
that she wanted to destroy Europe or she
hates her own country and all this 

902
00:42:19,161 --> 00:42:22,130
stuff.
I try not to impune everyone's motives,

903
00:42:22,370 --> 00:42:23,203
but when this happened in 2015 and there
was this combination of refugees and 

904
00:42:28,011 --> 00:42:31,640
immigrants and migrants and nobody could
figure out what was happening and we saw

905
00:42:31,641 --> 00:42:32,474
videos of people just thousands of 
people just running across borders and 

906
00:42:35,541 --> 00:42:36,374
all of this stuff and an odd amount of 
them that seemed to be men in their 

907
00:42:38,481 --> 00:42:40,550
twenties and not women and children and 
all that,

908
00:42:40,820 --> 00:42:45,820
which implies that they're often 
migrants looking for work and figures in

909
00:42:46,380 --> 00:42:47,213
the front takes.
The majority of the people became in 

910
00:42:48,681 --> 00:42:51,470
2015 have no right to be in Europe,
which is,

911
00:42:51,530 --> 00:42:52,880
which is fascinating.
And somehow,

912
00:42:52,881 --> 00:42:55,280
even if you say that you'll be labeled 
whatever,

913
00:42:55,670 --> 00:42:59,030
but what do you think her intention was 
in 2015?

914
00:42:59,600 --> 00:43:01,550
This is why I tried to go back to the 
beginning,

915
00:43:01,551 --> 00:43:04,370
not just with history but also with the 
philosophy on this.

916
00:43:05,040 --> 00:43:06,500
Um,
I don't impute,

917
00:43:06,740 --> 00:43:08,780
you know,
terrible motives to her.

918
00:43:08,810 --> 00:43:13,810
I think she was blackmailed by history,
was facing a truly terrible humanitarian

919
00:43:16,340 --> 00:43:17,173
crisis,
which was undoubtedly going on and I 

920
00:43:18,881 --> 00:43:22,160
said this in the face and I travel 
around and speak to many,

921
00:43:22,161 --> 00:43:22,994
many migrants from all over the world.
I've been to many of the countries they 

922
00:43:25,011 --> 00:43:25,844
fled from,
but I also go to speak to them in the 

923
00:43:27,501 --> 00:43:31,610
countries that they arrive into and 
speak to them in the camps and certainly

924
00:43:31,611 --> 00:43:35,300
have met and listened to more migrants.
And I think any of my critics,

925
00:43:35,840 --> 00:43:37,250
um,
but,

926
00:43:37,340 --> 00:43:38,060
you know,
it's,

927
00:43:38,060 --> 00:43:38,893
it's,
it's,

928
00:43:39,320 --> 00:43:40,240
it's easy to,
uh,

929
00:43:40,241 --> 00:43:41,074
uh,
to exaggerate the ease of the situation 

930
00:43:43,640 --> 00:43:45,950
that she faced or the ease of the 
solution to it.

931
00:43:45,950 --> 00:43:47,570
And,
and I think that shouldn't be done.

932
00:43:48,140 --> 00:43:48,973
It was a genuine crisis.
It remains a genuine crisis and the 

933
00:43:50,931 --> 00:43:54,740
biggest imaginable moral question.
Um,

934
00:43:55,280 --> 00:43:56,113
so we also know that at the moment that 
she made the decision in 2015 to 

935
00:44:01,191 --> 00:44:04,430
basically suspend all border controls.
Uh,

936
00:44:04,880 --> 00:44:08,210
I suggested in my book,
but since my book has come out,

937
00:44:08,211 --> 00:44:09,044
it's already now being confirmed by 
somebody who was with her at the time 

938
00:44:11,870 --> 00:44:14,540
that what happened and in particular was
somebody said to Merkel,

939
00:44:14,560 --> 00:44:15,393
we cannot have German border guards 
repelling migrants and the photos go 

940
00:44:20,781 --> 00:44:21,760
around the world,
right?

941
00:44:22,940 --> 00:44:25,340
So this is just condemned because of 
history.

942
00:44:25,341 --> 00:44:26,174
It's what is what a one friends for us,
because the second career of adult 

943
00:44:29,331 --> 00:44:32,670
Hitler,
it's an ugly way of looking at it,

944
00:44:32,671 --> 00:44:35,700
but it's,
it's not entirely implausible.

945
00:44:36,240 --> 00:44:37,140
Uh,
this is,

946
00:44:37,141 --> 00:44:40,260
this is just,
this is another go around this terrible,

947
00:44:40,261 --> 00:44:41,610
terrible history and past.

948
00:44:42,300 --> 00:44:43,650
But,
uh,

949
00:44:43,680 --> 00:44:47,040
you know,
it's not conspiracy.

950
00:44:47,041 --> 00:44:50,880
I show in the book how much.
It's more what we call in England,

951
00:44:50,890 --> 00:44:51,723
cockup.
I've always tended towards a cookout 

952
00:44:54,330 --> 00:44:57,750
view of history because if you see 
politics up close as I have done quite a

953
00:44:57,751 --> 00:44:59,580
bit throughout my life,
um,

954
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:00,833
you know,
that it's not really people pursuing 

955
00:45:02,371 --> 00:45:04,860
grant sort of schemes.
Really.

956
00:45:04,861 --> 00:45:08,700
It's people who haven't done the job 
before because you can't and there is no

957
00:45:08,701 --> 00:45:11,340
qualification that gets you in position 
beforehand.

958
00:45:11,850 --> 00:45:12,683
Um,
and trying to deal with not longterm 

959
00:45:15,510 --> 00:45:16,343
things,
but tomorrow morning's headlines and 

960
00:45:19,140 --> 00:45:20,810
media reaction the next day.
And they,

961
00:45:20,811 --> 00:45:21,644
they,
they,

962
00:45:21,810 --> 00:45:25,170
they drowned below the surface of this 
babble.

963
00:45:26,160 --> 00:45:28,260
That's how politics happens these days.

964
00:45:28,370 --> 00:45:29,203
Right?
Which is not the way that both sides 

965
00:45:30,591 --> 00:45:34,190
talk about politics they wanted,
they want to make it seem like the other

966
00:45:34,191 --> 00:45:39,191
side has constantly this grand plan and 
everything's going according to plan.

967
00:45:40,101 --> 00:45:41,120
Or as I said in the book,

968
00:45:41,240 --> 00:45:42,073
the um,
every single thing we thought would 

969
00:45:44,241 --> 00:45:45,074
happen didn't happen.
And nothing that has happened was 

970
00:45:47,811 --> 00:45:51,590
expected.
I'd go back to the fifties,

971
00:45:51,591 --> 00:45:52,424
you know,
the guest workers who were the first 

972
00:45:53,331 --> 00:45:54,164
people who came in after the war of 
first migrant waves into Europe from 

973
00:45:58,071 --> 00:46:02,180
Turkey and elsewhere as Merkel herself 
said in 2010,

974
00:46:02,181 --> 00:46:06,160
we expected them to go home.
Incredible mockup.

975
00:46:06,320 --> 00:46:07,153
Yeah.
Uh,

976
00:46:07,190 --> 00:46:08,780
but then we expect them to go ahead and 
then it didn't.

977
00:46:08,781 --> 00:46:09,230
Of course,
they,

978
00:46:09,230 --> 00:46:10,063
they wanted having tasted first world 
economics and among other things they 

979
00:46:14,211 --> 00:46:15,920
wanted to bring their families.
And of course,

980
00:46:15,921 --> 00:46:16,754
and if you have your families,
you have children and you enter the 

981
00:46:17,991 --> 00:46:20,410
schooling system and then you'll need 
healthcare and then you'll need it isn't

982
00:46:20,420 --> 00:46:21,010
element,

983
00:46:21,010 --> 00:46:23,080
especially if the state's giving you a 
lot of those things.

984
00:46:23,280 --> 00:46:25,650
And uh,
and that's why we are where we are,

985
00:46:25,700 --> 00:46:26,870
where we are,
where,

986
00:46:26,880 --> 00:46:27,840
um,
where,

987
00:46:28,320 --> 00:46:28,771
uh,
you know,

988
00:46:28,771 --> 00:46:29,604
the 2011 census identified people who 
call themselves white British on the 

989
00:46:32,791 --> 00:46:33,624
sensors as a minority in London,
minority in 23 out of 33 London 

990
00:46:37,441 --> 00:46:40,990
burroughs.
It's why all the demographic projections

991
00:46:40,991 --> 00:46:43,070
from across the continent,
um,

992
00:46:43,350 --> 00:46:45,630
show Europeans,
uh,

993
00:46:45,631 --> 00:46:46,464
I think not to overstate it,
losing the place they had to call home 

994
00:46:49,470 --> 00:46:51,750
or at least becoming a minority in it.
And this,

995
00:46:52,290 --> 00:46:54,230
you know,
there are some people talk about that in

996
00:46:54,231 --> 00:46:56,100
the,
in the sort of language of a,

997
00:46:56,130 --> 00:46:57,960
Haha,
the empire strikes back,

998
00:46:58,000 --> 00:46:58,833
now you're getting a taste of it.
You went round the world and now the 

999
00:47:01,291 --> 00:47:03,690
world's come to you.
And uh,

1000
00:47:04,020 --> 00:47:05,910
among other things,
I warn those people,

1001
00:47:05,911 --> 00:47:08,850
just be careful of that language,
the language of punishment.

1002
00:47:09,900 --> 00:47:13,760
Because if the language of that is,
as it were,

1003
00:47:13,770 --> 00:47:14,603
the punishment for colonialism,
then down the road you'll create a 

1004
00:47:17,371 --> 00:47:18,390
movement will say,
well,

1005
00:47:18,391 --> 00:47:19,920
we managed to end colonialism.

1006
00:47:21,050 --> 00:47:21,883
Yeah.
And then they'll come for you to no 

1007
00:47:23,361 --> 00:47:26,900
matter no matter what you do.
So with that being said,

1008
00:47:26,901 --> 00:47:31,901
so the identity part then is,
is really inextricably linked to this.

1009
00:47:32,350 --> 00:47:33,183
When you see the sort of what seems to 
be the rising white identity and 

1010
00:47:37,330 --> 00:47:39,690
movement or European identitarian 
movement or,

1011
00:47:39,760 --> 00:47:41,680
or whatever,
what do you,

1012
00:47:41,710 --> 00:47:42,543
what do you make of it?
Do you view it purely as the natural 

1013
00:47:44,921 --> 00:47:45,754
reaction to this?
Is there anything legitimate out of 

1014
00:47:47,351 --> 00:47:48,184
that?
Are there parts that are not racist or 

1015
00:47:49,361 --> 00:47:51,500
is it truly based in racist?

1016
00:47:51,650 --> 00:47:52,461
I'm,
I'm very,

1017
00:47:52,461 --> 00:47:54,620
very worried about this moment.
I have to say very,

1018
00:47:54,621 --> 00:47:56,700
very worried.
Um,

1019
00:47:58,400 --> 00:47:59,233
if you have people saying,
I'm proud of the color of my skin 

1020
00:48:02,781 --> 00:48:06,230
because it's just skin color.
Of course there'll be some people who'll

1021
00:48:06,260 --> 00:48:07,730
do the opposite.
I am.

1022
00:48:08,060 --> 00:48:09,610
Somebody said to me the other day and 
then it's,

1023
00:48:09,650 --> 00:48:11,570
the question is,
are you proud of being white?

1024
00:48:11,810 --> 00:48:12,561
And I said,
no,

1025
00:48:12,561 --> 00:48:16,970
of course not.
Why would I be proud of pigmentation?

1026
00:48:18,590 --> 00:48:20,190
But I then turned around and said,
no,

1027
00:48:20,191 --> 00:48:21,024
but I'm,
if you asked me if I am proud of my 

1028
00:48:22,011 --> 00:48:23,630
coach,
I would say of course,

1029
00:48:24,440 --> 00:48:26,340
but it's something else.
And that I,

1030
00:48:26,341 --> 00:48:27,174
I,
um,

1031
00:48:27,560 --> 00:48:29,960
it's not really about pride and the 
couch,

1032
00:48:29,970 --> 00:48:30,860
I,
I,

1033
00:48:31,340 --> 00:48:32,173
some years ago I wrote a piece about 
this for book the Prime Minister Gordon 

1034
00:48:34,580 --> 00:48:36,620
Brown was editing on Britishness.
And I said,

1035
00:48:36,630 --> 00:48:39,890
I didn't think of these things in terms 
of patriotism.

1036
00:48:39,890 --> 00:48:41,660
I think it would,
in terms of gratitude.

1037
00:48:42,680 --> 00:48:47,680
I feel gratitude before I've been lucky 
enough to be born into A.

1038
00:48:49,070 --> 00:48:53,540
I'd love it if other people who wanted 
to be part of it became a part of it.

1039
00:48:53,541 --> 00:48:54,374
And I think they can and I think it 
shouldn't be and can't be racially 

1040
00:48:59,450 --> 00:49:01,490
exclusionary.
I mean it's madness,

1041
00:49:02,390 --> 00:49:03,223
but it's a madness.
It seems to me that some people will be 

1042
00:49:05,151 --> 00:49:09,210
falling into by being pushed and by 
being ignorant and,

1043
00:49:09,230 --> 00:49:11,280
and other things.
But you know,

1044
00:49:11,300 --> 00:49:13,580
I come back to this thing,
there will be some people who will,

1045
00:49:13,581 --> 00:49:14,414
and I've,
I've found this a lot in conversations 

1046
00:49:15,741 --> 00:49:17,720
across the continent in the last year or
two,

1047
00:49:18,350 --> 00:49:21,560
there will be people who will grab a bit
of the identity thing for themselves,

1048
00:49:21,561 --> 00:49:26,390
for tactical reasons.
We will get to this goal and we'll use a

1049
00:49:26,391 --> 00:49:28,970
dishonest tactic just like you're using 
it.

1050
00:49:29,010 --> 00:49:29,843
Yeah.
And there'll be other people who will 

1051
00:49:31,551 --> 00:49:32,750
say,
no,

1052
00:49:32,751 --> 00:49:35,930
it's not just a tactic is what I,
it's what I feel is what I believe.

1053
00:49:36,820 --> 00:49:37,653
Um,
I just strongly urge people not to go 

1054
00:49:40,221 --> 00:49:41,054
down that route,
strongly urge them not to go down the 

1055
00:49:44,511 --> 00:49:49,511
route of identifying by an accident or 
skin pigmentation.

1056
00:49:50,390 --> 00:49:51,223
But to say if you,
if you want to talk in terms of values 

1057
00:49:56,001 --> 00:49:58,340
and in terms of civilization and of 
culture,

1058
00:49:58,790 --> 00:50:00,950
you cannot make it exclusionary like 
that.

1059
00:50:01,220 --> 00:50:04,780
But the point about this is it's you,
that,

1060
00:50:04,790 --> 00:50:07,610
that can only be that it's the,
as it were,

1061
00:50:07,611 --> 00:50:08,444
white young guy who's told that you've 
also got to tell it to the angry young 

1062
00:50:13,040 --> 00:50:18,040
black demagogue who's telling people 
have their own skin color to isolate and

1063
00:50:20,510 --> 00:50:23,910
congregate around around race.
It's got,

1064
00:50:23,930 --> 00:50:26,150
it's got everyone's got to,
you know,

1065
00:50:26,290 --> 00:50:28,940
to,
to make the deal as it were on this,

1066
00:50:29,550 --> 00:50:32,250
um,
but I just am filled with,

1067
00:50:32,750 --> 00:50:34,280
with,
you know,

1068
00:50:34,970 --> 00:50:36,320
concerned about this

1069
00:50:37,770 --> 00:50:38,603
and that probably has a little something
to do with the word strange because it 

1070
00:50:42,151 --> 00:50:42,984
seems to me that it's possible that the 
ship has already sailed on this perhaps 

1071
00:50:47,491 --> 00:50:48,324
more in Europe than in America because 
you guys had an integration problem 

1072
00:50:52,831 --> 00:50:55,590
already from,
which is finally being acknowledged now.

1073
00:50:55,800 --> 00:50:58,320
But then you also have this new set of 
people.

1074
00:50:58,380 --> 00:50:59,213
So even if everything was fantastic with
all the people that were there and all 

1075
00:51:03,121 --> 00:51:03,954
the integration before 2015,
what do you even do with just the new 

1076
00:51:07,231 --> 00:51:08,064
set of problem?

1077
00:51:08,240 --> 00:51:09,320
Let me give you an example.
By the way,

1078
00:51:09,350 --> 00:51:10,120
the,
um,

1079
00:51:10,120 --> 00:51:10,953
uh,
in Scotland there's a exists small 

1080
00:51:12,861 --> 00:51:13,694
amount now,
but a Catholic Protestant mainly 

1081
00:51:16,011 --> 00:51:19,100
centered around football supporting 
Celtic Rangers.

1082
00:51:19,540 --> 00:51:19,980
Uh,
we,

1083
00:51:19,980 --> 00:51:24,980
they go by a religious affiliation still
still.

1084
00:51:25,330 --> 00:51:26,163
Yeah.
That's because of a movement of 

1085
00:51:28,911 --> 00:51:33,110
Catholics from Ireland and Scotland a 
long time ago.

1086
00:51:33,160 --> 00:51:35,240
Yeah.
Let me give you another example.

1087
00:51:35,241 --> 00:51:38,480
I had a very dear friend who died 
recently who was a brilliant,

1088
00:51:38,510 --> 00:51:39,590
very,
very brave man,

1089
00:51:39,591 --> 00:51:43,310
uncle Shawn Callahan,
who was a double agent within the IRA,

1090
00:51:43,530 --> 00:51:44,390
the troubles.
And He,

1091
00:51:44,391 --> 00:51:45,224
uh,
he got up to the top of the IRA command 

1092
00:51:46,281 --> 00:51:49,370
and he was informing all the time to the
Irish state and saved many,

1093
00:51:49,371 --> 00:51:50,660
many lives.
Was an extraordinary,

1094
00:51:50,661 --> 00:51:52,390
extraordinary man.
Uh,

1095
00:51:52,400 --> 00:51:53,233
I wrote an obituary for him and others 
of his friends did one of the most 

1096
00:51:57,021 --> 00:51:59,060
negative.
In fact,

1097
00:51:59,061 --> 00:51:59,894
one of the only negative pieces of our 
short was in the Boston Globe who 

1098
00:52:03,801 --> 00:52:05,210
referred to him as a,
as a,

1099
00:52:05,330 --> 00:52:09,080
as a grass,
as somebody who,

1100
00:52:09,081 --> 00:52:10,500
after you've come out and written his 
memoir,

1101
00:52:10,580 --> 00:52:12,170
came to Hawk them around America.

1102
00:52:12,210 --> 00:52:14,640
Not just selling a book on writing but 
hawking a book.

1103
00:52:15,830 --> 00:52:20,830
Why would that appear in the Boston 
Globe only because a very long time ago,

1104
00:52:22,790 --> 00:52:23,623
a large number of people from Ireland 
arrived in this country and settled in 

1105
00:52:27,081 --> 00:52:27,914
Boston and held onto their Irish 
identity and some of them have held on 

1106
00:52:33,201 --> 00:52:36,440
to a belief that the IRA,
a murderess,

1107
00:52:36,441 --> 00:52:41,090
murderess sectarian gang,
whereas where their people.

1108
00:52:41,810 --> 00:52:45,470
So all these centuries later,
um,

1109
00:52:45,610 --> 00:52:48,200
uh,
the attitude and the Boston Globe,

1110
00:52:48,500 --> 00:52:51,410
when a man who risked his life to save 
many,

1111
00:52:51,411 --> 00:52:56,240
many other people's lives dies and he's 
to attack him basically as a grass and a

1112
00:52:56,241 --> 00:52:57,170
snitch.
Okay.

1113
00:52:57,380 --> 00:53:02,380
That's the movement of Catholic Irish 
people into America who on earth,

1114
00:53:03,531 --> 00:53:08,531
things that when you bring the entire 
developing world into Europe,

1115
00:53:10,070 --> 00:53:13,460
including very,
very large numbers of young men from the

1116
00:53:13,461 --> 00:53:14,294
Muslim world,
that this is going to be sorted out by 

1117
00:53:16,071 --> 00:53:18,300
next February.
Yeah.

1118
00:53:18,550 --> 00:53:19,870
You know,
or you know,

1119
00:53:19,871 --> 00:53:22,870
roughly this time next year.
So does this show,

1120
00:53:23,610 --> 00:53:25,800
you know,
I use the phrase lazy thinking a lot,

1121
00:53:25,801 --> 00:53:29,190
but maybe that's not the right way.
It shows an inability to think,

1122
00:53:29,490 --> 00:53:31,440
you know,
what you said about Merkel in 2010.

1123
00:53:31,441 --> 00:53:31,771
It's like,
well,

1124
00:53:31,771 --> 00:53:33,690
we thought they were going to leave.
That's not lazy thinking.

1125
00:53:33,691 --> 00:53:35,790
That's man.
Did you even think.

1126
00:53:35,820 --> 00:53:36,571
I mean,
you know,

1127
00:53:36,571 --> 00:53:38,220
it's pretty good in Germany,
you know,

1128
00:53:38,221 --> 00:53:39,054
if you let people in.
Is there ever been a self imposed group 

1129
00:53:43,141 --> 00:53:46,880
of people that left a western country to
go back to Iraq?

1130
00:53:47,560 --> 00:53:49,270
I don't think so.
Very uncommon know

1131
00:53:49,550 --> 00:53:50,840
of course,
once people,

1132
00:53:51,950 --> 00:53:56,950
once people realize that the economics 
works better in Europe,

1133
00:53:57,590 --> 00:54:00,680
doesn't in sub Saharan Africa,
of course,

1134
00:54:00,740 --> 00:54:02,390
of course they come,
but we.

1135
00:54:02,391 --> 00:54:03,224
I mean we're,
we're just so torn about this and I 

1136
00:54:05,331 --> 00:54:08,870
think we have to rouse ourselves to more
than moroseness.

1137
00:54:09,320 --> 00:54:10,153
We're talking about it.
It seems to me because we were not sure 

1138
00:54:12,411 --> 00:54:14,420
why on the.
I'm pretty sure why,

1139
00:54:14,421 --> 00:54:18,500
but as counselors,
we're not entirely sure why it should be

1140
00:54:18,501 --> 00:54:20,720
our right to keep anyone out.
I'm not here.

1141
00:54:20,721 --> 00:54:22,760
There's obviously an American.
America has a different issue.

1142
00:54:22,761 --> 00:54:23,594
Of course it's an American.
It's legitimate to say America is a 

1143
00:54:26,241 --> 00:54:27,074
nation of immigrants.
It's not legitimate to say that about 

1144
00:54:29,271 --> 00:54:30,260
Britain.
It just isn't.

1145
00:54:30,290 --> 00:54:34,070
Hasn't been delivered late 20th century.
A Nation of immigrants and they're very,

1146
00:54:34,071 --> 00:54:37,430
very static population.
Even the Norman Conquest,

1147
00:54:37,431 --> 00:54:38,264
the thousand years ago shifted the 
population by about five percent in the 

1148
00:54:40,581 --> 00:54:41,990
UK.
So,

1149
00:54:42,570 --> 00:54:45,500
um,
I understand that in America,

1150
00:54:45,540 --> 00:54:48,380
the whole thing to do with immigration 
is a bit harder.

1151
00:54:48,980 --> 00:54:51,590
People feel they're talking not about 
them,

1152
00:54:51,620 --> 00:54:56,080
but about you or me and in Europe,
that,

1153
00:54:56,081 --> 00:54:58,670
that,
that is a bit of the case.

1154
00:54:58,671 --> 00:54:59,504
Now,
there are people who talk in those 

1155
00:54:59,961 --> 00:55:01,010
terms,
but there's also.

1156
00:55:01,280 --> 00:55:03,620
There's also just this additional thing 
of,

1157
00:55:04,280 --> 00:55:05,430
by what?
Right?

1158
00:55:05,750 --> 00:55:06,890
By what?
Right?

1159
00:55:07,130 --> 00:55:10,280
Would I be allowed to say?
Anyone can come.

1160
00:55:11,170 --> 00:55:12,003
Now,
I think there are all sorts of ways you 

1161
00:55:13,011 --> 00:55:14,940
argue the law

1162
00:55:15,150 --> 00:55:19,920
matter shouldn't matter.
The difference between legal and illegal

1163
00:55:19,980 --> 00:55:21,580
is everything.
Look,

1164
00:55:21,810 --> 00:55:23,340
I'm not a Canadian.
Why is that?

1165
00:55:23,341 --> 00:55:24,174
Because we have a border.
That means that a Canadian has to obey 

1166
00:55:26,671 --> 00:55:29,670
the laws of Canada and I have to obey 
the laws of the United States.

1167
00:55:29,920 --> 00:55:32,580
People think that even in of itself,
but that's somehow controversial.

1168
00:55:32,910 --> 00:55:33,780
We,
by the way,

1169
00:55:34,140 --> 00:55:34,973
what a beautiful thing.
It's just been watching Justin Trudeau 

1170
00:55:37,860 --> 00:55:42,860
have to face.
It's so easy for politicians in Europe.

1171
00:55:42,961 --> 00:55:44,600
We've seen a lot,
you've seen it here in America.

1172
00:55:44,620 --> 00:55:45,453
Canadians have seen it.
It's so easy to grandstand or this let 

1173
00:55:49,951 --> 00:55:53,890
them in a open the doors because when 
the effects happen,

1174
00:55:53,920 --> 00:55:54,753
hopefully you'll be out of power and 
you'll be retired somewhere in a nice 

1175
00:55:57,001 --> 00:55:59,550
area with lots of people like you,
which was your dirty little secret.

1176
00:55:59,551 --> 00:56:00,210
Okay.

1177
00:56:00,210 --> 00:56:01,043
He'll move to New Zealand or something.
Isn't that where they all moving in New 

1178
00:56:02,850 --> 00:56:03,683
Zealand?

1179
00:56:05,420 --> 00:56:06,690
Um,
but,

1180
00:56:07,070 --> 00:56:11,520
but yeah,
Trudeau is on the qb sort of berated and

1181
00:56:11,580 --> 00:56:14,130
morally grandstanding.
And then of course when there's movement

1182
00:56:14,131 --> 00:56:16,920
of people from America across the 
Canadian border,

1183
00:56:17,320 --> 00:56:19,450
uh,
they start to get worried.

1184
00:56:19,720 --> 00:56:21,780
A Bill Gates,
by the way,

1185
00:56:21,781 --> 00:56:23,500
at the beginning of the migrant crisis,
said,

1186
00:56:23,530 --> 00:56:24,363
gee,
that America should take in the same 

1187
00:56:25,961 --> 00:56:26,794
proportion of migrants that year as 
Germany to Germany took in an extra two 

1188
00:56:29,231 --> 00:56:31,330
percent of its population in one year 
alone.

1189
00:56:32,130 --> 00:56:33,010
Uh,
uh,

1190
00:56:33,011 --> 00:56:35,220
and Bill Gates said we should take in 
the same numbers in,

1191
00:56:35,360 --> 00:56:37,390
in Germany.
It has Germany did in,

1192
00:56:37,460 --> 00:56:38,940
in America.
Uh,

1193
00:56:38,980 --> 00:56:40,180
well,
interesting enough.

1194
00:56:40,190 --> 00:56:41,750
Only a couple of months ago,
Bill Gates,

1195
00:56:41,780 --> 00:56:43,660
I did a reverse ferret on that.
Actually,

1196
00:56:43,661 --> 00:56:46,360
no,
he said he certainly in a set of remarks

1197
00:56:46,361 --> 00:56:49,780
that if Germany continues like this,
it's going to destroy it.

1198
00:56:50,170 --> 00:56:51,970
Well,
imagine if Bill Gates,

1199
00:56:51,971 --> 00:56:55,150
instead of being the world's richest man
had been in charge of anything,

1200
00:56:55,940 --> 00:56:56,920
uh,
uh,

1201
00:56:56,930 --> 00:56:57,763
then you'd have gone through what 
Germany is going through and it would 

1202
00:57:00,881 --> 00:57:05,320
have vastly outlasted him as this will 
outlast Merkel and all of us.

1203
00:57:05,770 --> 00:57:09,280
So the issue,
it seems to me the two things that I can

1204
00:57:09,281 --> 00:57:10,114
point out,
one is demanding with our political 

1205
00:57:12,791 --> 00:57:17,470
leaders in particular,
think through things beyond the two year

1206
00:57:17,471 --> 00:57:19,720
electoral cycle or the four year 
electoral cycle,

1207
00:57:19,780 --> 00:57:22,840
or more importantly,
just more of a morning's headlines.

1208
00:57:23,290 --> 00:57:24,123
You might have a bad mornings news.
It's a lot better than fucking up your 

1209
00:57:27,401 --> 00:57:29,110
country.
It's a lot better.

1210
00:57:29,140 --> 00:57:29,973
It really is.
And the second thing about this is we 

1211
00:57:33,011 --> 00:57:38,011
have to develop the ability to have an 
adult discussion about these things that

1212
00:57:38,470 --> 00:57:41,500
recognizes it's not between,
you know,

1213
00:57:41,680 --> 00:57:43,180
your,
for the migrants.

1214
00:57:43,270 --> 00:57:46,120
I'm against them or you know,
uh,

1215
00:57:46,121 --> 00:57:47,530
um,
your Churchill,

1216
00:57:47,540 --> 00:57:49,840
I'm Hitler,
your chamberlain,

1217
00:57:49,841 --> 00:57:50,674
your Hitler.
Just to have the discussion on 

1218
00:57:53,471 --> 00:57:58,471
recognizing these are different opinions
about our future and the and the,

1219
00:57:59,110 --> 00:58:02,680
you know,
I say toward the end of the book that we

1220
00:58:02,681 --> 00:58:04,060
have the tools for doing this.

1221
00:58:04,060 --> 00:58:04,893
Aristotle showed us a long time ago,
this is just a competition between 

1222
00:58:08,561 --> 00:58:09,371
virtues.
Angola,

1223
00:58:09,371 --> 00:58:10,204
Merkel very understandably felt the 
human virtue of mercy to be merciful 

1224
00:58:14,591 --> 00:58:17,890
towards people who are trying to come 
and I say yes,

1225
00:58:17,920 --> 00:58:18,753
but there is another virtue competing 
with that which is the virtue of 

1226
00:58:20,711 --> 00:58:21,544
justice,
not just justice for the people of the 

1227
00:58:23,981 --> 00:58:25,660
world wanting to come and have a better 
life,

1228
00:58:25,990 --> 00:58:26,823
but justice for the peoples of Europe.
If you have the discussion on those 

1229
00:58:30,761 --> 00:58:35,230
terms between competing virtues,
not doing good and evil right and wrong.

1230
00:58:35,290 --> 00:58:36,220
Churchill,
Hitler,

1231
00:58:37,150 --> 00:58:37,811
me,
good.

1232
00:58:37,811 --> 00:58:38,644
You not see,
then you might be able to get somewhere 

1233
00:58:41,711 --> 00:58:42,544
and Mr Gresham,
but it's as if we've sort of wounded 

1234
00:58:44,951 --> 00:58:48,220
ourselves before even starting at the 
start line.

1235
00:58:49,360 --> 00:58:51,700
So as to people that try to engage in 
that.

1236
00:58:51,701 --> 00:58:54,490
I think that's what we consistently try 
to do.

1237
00:58:54,491 --> 00:58:57,130
And I see you debating all sorts of 
people from every walk of life.

1238
00:58:57,131 --> 00:58:59,980
Yeah,
I have a promiscuous debating debate.

1239
00:59:00,450 --> 00:59:02,060
It basically everywhere,
everyone,

1240
00:59:03,100 --> 00:59:04,330
some people are like,
you know,

1241
00:59:04,360 --> 00:59:05,193
now in prison,
not because I had debated and so much 

1242
00:59:07,320 --> 00:59:08,710
they were prosecuting it,
but I mean,

1243
00:59:08,800 --> 00:59:11,170
you know,
I've debated lots of people who I'm sure

1244
00:59:11,171 --> 00:59:12,004
you've sent a couple of people to mental
institutions for after they've had to 

1245
00:59:14,351 --> 00:59:17,530
deal with your wit that it's not that.
I mean,

1246
00:59:17,590 --> 00:59:18,460
I definitely,
if,

1247
00:59:18,540 --> 00:59:20,170
if somebody is,
is,

1248
00:59:20,230 --> 00:59:22,250
uh,
out in the general public

1249
00:59:22,250 --> 00:59:24,320
and has a platform and they wanted to 
be,

1250
00:59:24,400 --> 00:59:26,870
I've always had the view,
yes.

1251
00:59:27,410 --> 00:59:28,760
That's not sale debate anyone by the 
way.

1252
00:59:28,761 --> 00:59:30,080
Sometimes people go,
oh yeah,

1253
00:59:30,260 --> 00:59:31,520
you wouldn't debate me.

1254
00:59:31,990 --> 00:59:36,240
I think you've got to twitter followers 
and you're nuts.

1255
00:59:37,350 --> 00:59:39,530
Blue Fox on twitter.
You're like,

1256
00:59:39,870 --> 00:59:41,280
Xena,
warrior princess.

1257
00:59:42,380 --> 00:59:45,120
No,
that woman,

1258
00:59:45,121 --> 00:59:48,880
she really wants to debate.
I'm alright.

1259
00:59:48,900 --> 00:59:49,733
I think,
I think we got a nice holistic piece of 

1260
00:59:51,391 --> 00:59:52,460
this year.
Um,

1261
00:59:52,500 --> 00:59:54,690
so I wanted to shift altogether to end 
this on a,

1262
00:59:54,750 --> 00:59:57,600
on a,
something somewhat on lifting,

1263
00:59:57,850 --> 01:00:01,680
uplifting as someone that does all this,
that you speak about this stuff.

1264
01:00:01,681 --> 01:00:03,330
You deeply care about this stuff.
I,

1265
01:00:03,331 --> 01:00:04,164
you know,
I worry about this stuff constantly be 

1266
01:00:05,191 --> 01:00:06,024
wowed me staring off into nothing in the
middle of the day and I'm literally 

1267
01:00:08,641 --> 01:00:10,980
worried about the fate of the Western 
world.

1268
01:00:10,981 --> 01:00:11,400
You know,
I,

1269
01:00:11,400 --> 01:00:14,730
I wish I was playing video games again 
as much as I used to,

1270
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:18,480
but yeah,
I lost you on the video game thing.

1271
01:00:18,550 --> 01:00:19,510
Yeah.
But what,

1272
01:00:19,511 --> 01:00:20,344
what do you do for fun?
What do you do to just forget all this 

1273
01:00:21,811 --> 01:00:24,030
stuff and just enjoy yourself and be 
human?

1274
01:00:24,230 --> 01:00:25,650
Oh Gosh,
I.

1275
01:00:26,650 --> 01:00:27,483
well,
I know you don't like this type of 

1276
01:00:28,091 --> 01:00:28,940
question because this is.

1277
01:00:28,970 --> 01:00:29,380
Well,
I'm,

1278
01:00:29,380 --> 01:00:34,190
I'm careful about private matters.
Um,

1279
01:00:34,700 --> 01:00:35,533
I,
I'm very happily in a relationship with 

1280
01:00:38,541 --> 01:00:41,300
many years.
A lot of my family.

1281
01:00:41,480 --> 01:00:43,250
I've got wonderful friends.
I see them a lot.

1282
01:00:44,120 --> 01:00:47,270
Um,
I to relax.

1283
01:00:47,271 --> 01:00:47,961
I mean,
I read,

1284
01:00:47,961 --> 01:00:49,910
I read all the time,
uh,

1285
01:00:50,360 --> 01:00:51,830
and not just good,
it's enjoyable,

1286
01:00:51,831 --> 01:00:56,831
but because it's just,
I'm just endlessly learning and thinking

1287
01:00:58,271 --> 01:00:59,104
and so it's just so stimulating 
sometimes when you have that thing of 

1288
01:01:02,541 --> 01:01:04,750
what I described as catching up with 
true,

1289
01:01:04,940 --> 01:01:08,210
you'd always known was there,
um,

1290
01:01:08,840 --> 01:01:09,673
the thrill of recognition that you get 
from reading that I think is harder to 

1291
01:01:12,111 --> 01:01:16,700
find in video games or television.
All right,

1292
01:01:16,701 --> 01:01:17,320
so,
you know,

1293
01:01:17,320 --> 01:01:18,470
so I do a lot of reading

1294
01:01:18,760 --> 01:01:19,593
as I'll shift this a little then.
So what would you say more importantly 

1295
01:01:22,331 --> 01:01:23,290
than that,
to the,

1296
01:01:23,350 --> 01:01:24,183
to the person that's watching this,
the type of email that I get all the 

1297
01:01:26,441 --> 01:01:27,274
time,
the person that is just a regular 

1298
01:01:28,811 --> 01:01:30,430
person,
you know,

1299
01:01:30,431 --> 01:01:33,460
working a regular job that sees these 
problems,

1300
01:01:33,461 --> 01:01:36,430
that hears you,
that is not a bigot and is not a racist,

1301
01:01:36,670 --> 01:01:40,360
but he's genuinely afraid of doing what 
you do every which is say what you think

1302
01:01:40,870 --> 01:01:44,560
that they're genuinely afraid of.
Just putting their thoughts out there,

1303
01:01:44,561 --> 01:01:45,394
be it on social media or be it.
It's getting to the point where they're 

1304
01:01:47,411 --> 01:01:49,830
afraid to talk to their own spouses 
about what,

1305
01:01:49,990 --> 01:01:50,823
what,
what could you say to somebody to give 

1306
01:01:51,611 --> 01:01:53,040
them a little bit of a boost on that?

1307
01:01:53,270 --> 01:01:54,380
I tell you what,
the,

1308
01:01:54,381 --> 01:01:57,710
the,
the water's not as cold as people say.

1309
01:01:58,460 --> 01:02:00,080
It really isn't.
I mean,

1310
01:02:00,110 --> 01:02:01,990
I'm,
I'm,

1311
01:02:04,170 --> 01:02:05,170
I'm,
it's,

1312
01:02:05,190 --> 01:02:06,500
it's hard.
This one isn't it?

1313
01:02:06,501 --> 01:02:07,334
Because if you,
there has been a lot of focus on the 

1314
01:02:09,921 --> 01:02:10,754
negatives.
Certainly some of the things we're 

1315
01:02:11,570 --> 01:02:12,403
talking about today in recent years and 
there's a sort of growing feeling of 

1316
01:02:14,911 --> 01:02:15,744
actually wanting to previous recent 
inferior as a google guy is a 

1317
01:02:18,501 --> 01:02:20,040
demonstration.
The more that stuff

1318
01:02:20,040 --> 01:02:22,890
happens,
the more that people keep down.

1319
01:02:24,120 --> 01:02:25,920
Um,
and um,

1320
01:02:26,620 --> 01:02:28,190
it's very hard to.
I mean,

1321
01:02:28,200 --> 01:02:31,440
you can't be brave for other people.
You can't tell other people,

1322
01:02:31,441 --> 01:02:32,700
you know,
speak up.

1323
01:02:33,870 --> 01:02:34,950
But,
uh,

1324
01:02:35,610 --> 01:02:38,100
I think we can encourage each other to.
I mean,

1325
01:02:38,101 --> 01:02:39,570
um,
you know,

1326
01:02:40,020 --> 01:02:45,020
sometimes people approach me in a sort 
of just want to not use.

1327
01:02:45,610 --> 01:02:49,190
Must be pretty hard for you to live 
good.

1328
01:02:49,590 --> 01:02:50,161
No,
it's great.

1329
01:02:50,161 --> 01:02:52,500
I'm like,
I have cocktails.

1330
01:02:52,530 --> 01:02:53,550
My friends,
I,

1331
01:02:53,551 --> 01:02:56,220
I go to concerts,
I read things I want,

1332
01:02:56,221 --> 01:02:58,170
I enjoy the music,
I love and,

1333
01:02:58,590 --> 01:02:59,423
and I travel where I live and I go all 
over the world and we're not going to 

1334
01:03:03,401 --> 01:03:07,380
get any extra security tonight already.
I hope we're going to beverly hills.

1335
01:03:07,381 --> 01:03:10,680
I think we'll probably be friends.
We pick a fight with anyone today,

1336
01:03:11,190 --> 01:03:12,840
but no,
I am A.

1337
01:03:12,840 --> 01:03:16,470
I mean it's either you sit up and 
there's a sort of exaggerate.

1338
01:03:16,520 --> 01:03:17,353
Yeah,
that's why I'm asking you this question 

1339
01:03:18,691 --> 01:03:20,520
because I do think it's partly in 
people's mind.

1340
01:03:20,521 --> 01:03:22,290
You start speaking then you realize.
Yeah,

1341
01:03:22,291 --> 01:03:24,060
I mean somebody said some bad stuff 
about me,

1342
01:03:24,061 --> 01:03:25,020
but I'm still here.
Yeah,

1343
01:03:25,021 --> 01:03:25,801
exactly.
So people,

1344
01:03:25,801 --> 01:03:28,190
some are quite a lot of the time,
young journalists and things saying you,

1345
01:03:28,220 --> 01:03:29,580
I'd really like to write this but you 
know,

1346
01:03:29,581 --> 01:03:31,870
I don't know.
And all this sort of thing and you know,

1347
01:03:31,920 --> 01:03:33,380
get this.
Let just,

1348
01:03:33,670 --> 01:03:37,500
just see and just write it.
And um,

1349
01:03:37,920 --> 01:03:41,640
I mean no one ever awarded somebody for 
a career in journalism the way they said

1350
01:03:41,641 --> 01:03:44,400
nothing over.
There are some writers in New York Times

1351
01:03:44,401 --> 01:03:45,234
you could,
you could say,

1352
01:03:45,720 --> 01:03:47,160
but um,
uh,

1353
01:03:47,161 --> 01:03:49,940
you know,
you just just,

1354
01:03:49,941 --> 01:03:51,400
just do it.
And if it does,

1355
01:03:51,401 --> 01:03:52,234
what?
I'm very lucky in that I've spent my 

1356
01:03:53,400 --> 01:03:54,233
career saying what I think and being 
able to earn a living precariously but 

1357
01:03:59,131 --> 01:03:59,964
successfully and uh,
I feel like I can write for almost any 

1358
01:04:04,651 --> 01:04:08,700
of the newspapers I want to write for 
and almost all of them will have me.

1359
01:04:08,700 --> 01:04:10,890
And uh,
I love writing for the range of them and

1360
01:04:10,900 --> 01:04:14,870
I'm very lucky to do this,
but it's not like I'm,

1361
01:04:15,480 --> 01:04:16,950
it's not like that's rare.
I mean,

1362
01:04:16,951 --> 01:04:17,784
I mean it's,
it's still legal to say what you think 

1363
01:04:21,720 --> 01:04:23,430
and um,
and so I,

1364
01:04:23,431 --> 01:04:24,264
I just hate it when people say,
I really admire you for saying what 

1365
01:04:26,101 --> 01:04:27,840
you're thinking here,
what the hell do you do?

1366
01:04:28,710 --> 01:04:29,640
And,
um,

1367
01:04:30,540 --> 01:04:34,550
but he said it's only that we all,
we all get used to the idea and just,

1368
01:04:34,551 --> 01:04:35,311
sorry,
just one other thing,

1369
01:04:35,311 --> 01:04:39,270
which is just about you.
But I find myself more and more tolerant

1370
01:04:39,271 --> 01:04:42,090
of people's opinions,
just more and more tolerant of it.

1371
01:04:42,540 --> 01:04:43,470
I mean,
I see,

1372
01:04:43,560 --> 01:04:47,370
I see people driving themselves mad and 
I just sort of thing.

1373
01:04:47,400 --> 01:04:49,110
I mean there are some things like if 
somebody,

1374
01:04:49,111 --> 01:04:51,150
you know,
I discovered they were into,

1375
01:04:51,320 --> 01:04:53,220
you know,
kitty fiddling or something and I'd have

1376
01:04:53,221 --> 01:04:54,930
something to say to them,
but pretty much,

1377
01:04:55,320 --> 01:04:56,153
you know,
on politics and all sorts of other 

1378
01:04:57,871 --> 01:04:58,980
things I find myself like,
oh,

1379
01:04:58,981 --> 01:04:59,640
that's interesting.

1380
01:04:59,640 --> 01:05:02,490
Why do you think that?
And um,

1381
01:05:02,880 --> 01:05:03,713
and you know,
it's fascinating and who would want to 

1382
01:05:07,141 --> 01:05:11,370
keep all of that down and um,
you know,

1383
01:05:11,371 --> 01:05:14,220
as long as we agree on the parameters,
as long as we agree that,

1384
01:05:14,221 --> 01:05:16,860
you know,
we don't shoot on the beach hut,

1385
01:05:17,010 --> 01:05:20,170
which is obviously up for negotiation,
it seems at the moment.

1386
01:05:20,171 --> 01:05:23,710
But as long as we don't do that,
then what's the problem?

1387
01:05:24,590 --> 01:05:28,090
Just just speak.
They don't expect somebody else to do it

1388
01:05:28,091 --> 01:05:29,440
for you.
I don't,

1389
01:05:29,441 --> 01:05:30,274
don't,
don't siphon it off like it's a wing of 

1390
01:05:31,541 --> 01:05:33,790
government,
like the free speech center.

1391
01:05:34,670 --> 01:05:37,600
This is for you to do for us to do for 
everyone.

1392
01:05:39,340 --> 01:05:42,940
That's how you ended interview.
Douglas Murray is on the twitter.

1393
01:05:42,941 --> 01:05:43,774
He is.
I've just been informed via the 

1394
01:05:45,371 --> 01:05:46,204
teleprompter.
You're a thousand followers away from 

1395
01:05:47,921 --> 01:05:49,570
100,000,
is that right?

1396
01:05:49,590 --> 01:05:51,310
No.
You're monitoring this constantly.

1397
01:05:51,560 --> 01:05:53,560
Yeah.
Must have these.

1398
01:05:53,710 --> 01:05:54,543
I think we can get you there.
Should I do something like if I get 

1399
01:05:56,260 --> 01:05:57,340
100,000
followers,

1400
01:05:57,341 --> 01:05:59,680
I'll do something.
What would you do?

1401
01:05:59,710 --> 01:06:02,290
I tend to know who received.
Discussing.

1402
01:06:03,090 --> 01:06:03,923
Well,
this guys head over.

1403
01:06:03,960 --> 01:06:07,450
Greg's right for more on Douglas.
Follow him on twitter.

1404
01:06:07,451 --> 01:06:10,600
He doesn't care that much,
but I want the man to get to 100,000.

1405
01:06:10,780 --> 01:06:12,480
It's Douglas.
Kay Marie.

1406
01:06:12,580 --> 01:06:13,413
Thanks.
