1
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:08,070
Allow me to tell you the classic 
children's tale of chicken,

2
00:00:08,071 --> 00:00:11,040
little otherwise known as henny penny as
the tale goes.

3
00:00:11,041 --> 00:00:11,874
Little Henny was outside one day when an
acorn fell from a tree and hit her on 

4
00:00:14,701 --> 00:00:18,180
the head because of her naive,
a Tay and simple mindedness.

5
00:00:18,181 --> 00:00:19,014
Henny foolishly began to believe that 
the sky itself was falling down around 

6
00:00:22,741 --> 00:00:23,574
her.
She spent the rest of the day trying to 

7
00:00:24,691 --> 00:00:25,524
convince others like Goosey loosey and 
Turkey lurky that the sky was most 

8
00:00:29,131 --> 00:00:32,580
certainly falling in.
The world was surely coming to an end in

9
00:00:32,581 --> 00:00:35,970
most versions of the story.
The trip does not end well for Henny and

10
00:00:35,971 --> 00:00:39,570
her hysterical friends after they meet 
the sly foxy.

11
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:41,850
I don't want to give everything away 
though,

12
00:00:41,851 --> 00:00:45,930
so either read the story for yourself or
check out the classic season six episode

13
00:00:45,931 --> 00:00:48,630
of the Golden Girls in which they 
reenact the tail.

14
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:52,650
I mentioned Hani and Lucy and Turkey and
foxy.

15
00:00:52,651 --> 00:00:54,570
Not just because they're great names to 
say,

16
00:00:54,571 --> 00:00:55,404
but because it seems that just about 
everyone is telling us the sky is 

17
00:00:58,351 --> 00:01:01,800
falling these days between trump,
Russia and North Korea.

18
00:01:01,801 --> 00:01:05,710
We've got about half the country that's 
in total freakout mode everyday.

19
00:01:05,730 --> 00:01:06,563
This freak out takes on a new urgency.
One day the world is ending because 

20
00:01:09,751 --> 00:01:10,584
America left the Paris climate accord 
and another day it's because of the net 

21
00:01:13,561 --> 00:01:17,640
neutrality reversal and another day it's
because trump holds his water glass with

22
00:01:17,641 --> 00:01:18,474
two hands.
This endless hysteria is not only being 

23
00:01:20,791 --> 00:01:21,624
amplified by the media,
but it's actually being poked and 

24
00:01:23,431 --> 00:01:25,800
prodded by them as well.
Blue check,

25
00:01:25,801 --> 00:01:26,634
verify journalists on twitter who worked
for news organizations which really are 

26
00:01:30,091 --> 00:01:30,924
nothing more than partisan activist 
outlets want to keep you clicking on 

27
00:01:33,871 --> 00:01:34,704
their articles and videos and they know 
that the best way to do that is to 

28
00:01:37,651 --> 00:01:39,900
convince you that not only is the sky 
falling,

29
00:01:39,901 --> 00:01:42,000
but it's gonna land directly on your 
head.

30
00:01:42,570 --> 00:01:47,570
What F and just hear me out on this one.
This outrage factory is completely wrong

31
00:01:48,211 --> 00:01:51,600
and the world isn't coming to an end 
just yet crazy.

32
00:01:51,601 --> 00:01:52,434
I know,
but I think that it actually might be 

33
00:01:54,481 --> 00:01:55,314
true.
This doesn't mean that things are 

34
00:01:56,641 --> 00:01:59,640
perfect,
but they are pretty damn good.

35
00:02:00,090 --> 00:02:02,250
This is the position of my guest this 
week,

36
00:02:02,251 --> 00:02:06,240
Harvard psychology professor Steven 
Pinker pinker argues,

37
00:02:06,241 --> 00:02:09,630
despite our world of perceived horror 
and chaos,

38
00:02:09,631 --> 00:02:12,210
people are living longer,
happier,

39
00:02:12,211 --> 00:02:14,700
healthier,
and freer lives right now,

40
00:02:14,701 --> 00:02:17,100
more than any other time in human 
history.

41
00:02:17,490 --> 00:02:19,290
This doesn't mean we don't have work to 
do,

42
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:21,630
but if we don't stop and smell the 
roses,

43
00:02:21,631 --> 00:02:22,464
we might toss away all the goodness 
humans have created for the prospect of 

44
00:02:26,581 --> 00:02:27,414
a utopia that will never appear.
This is why I'm so proud of the work 

45
00:02:30,181 --> 00:02:31,014
we've done here on the Rubin report.
I truly believed that the conversations 

46
00:02:33,541 --> 00:02:37,320
we're having are at least some part of 
the antidote to the craziness right now.

47
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:38,393
If those of us who care about 
enlightenment principles like science 

48
00:02:40,651 --> 00:02:44,760
reason and natural rights can make our 
voices louder than this cliff,

49
00:02:44,761 --> 00:02:45,594
we seem to be about to go off of,
might just turn into a bridge to a 

50
00:02:48,721 --> 00:02:49,554
better world.
Henny penny story took a drastic turn 

51
00:02:52,081 --> 00:02:56,670
when she met Foxy Lacasse who tricked 
her and her friends to go to his layer.

52
00:02:56,970 --> 00:02:57,870
Well,
in real life,

53
00:02:57,871 --> 00:03:00,790
we've got a wolf blitzer in a situation 
room.

54
00:03:01,090 --> 00:03:01,923
If the sky is falling,
maybe just changing the channel is all 

55
00:03:05,201 --> 00:03:07,360
we have to do to survive the day.

56
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:13,433
Joining me today is a johnstone family 
professor in the Department of 

57
00:03:16,470 --> 00:03:20,370
Psychology at Harvard University as well
as the New York Times bestselling author

58
00:03:20,371 --> 00:03:23,790
whose new book enlightenment now is for 
sale right now,

59
00:03:24,030 --> 00:03:25,590
Steven Pinker,
welcome to the Rubin report.

60
00:03:25,620 --> 00:03:26,760
Thank you.
I am.

61
00:03:26,820 --> 00:03:27,653
I am thrilled to have you here.
I think I have emailed or called or 

62
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:32,393
contacted or pigeon messaged everyone 
related to you or do that knows you in 

63
00:03:36,991 --> 00:03:39,710
any way to get you here and here I am 
and here you are.

64
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:40,553
Worked.
It goes to prove that a little 

65
00:03:42,121 --> 00:03:44,340
positivity I think can make some things 
happen.

66
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:45,600
So true.
Yeah.

67
00:03:45,650 --> 00:03:46,960
Alright.
A lot of want to talk to you about.

68
00:03:46,980 --> 00:03:47,813
I thought before we dive into the book 
and all the things that you teach and 

69
00:03:50,701 --> 00:03:52,020
write about and all that.
I just,

70
00:03:52,050 --> 00:03:52,883
I like hearing a little bit about 
people's history and where they come 

71
00:03:54,871 --> 00:03:56,160
from and growing up and all that.

72
00:03:56,400 --> 00:04:00,420
You are Canadian and I've had a lot of 
Canadians on lately.

73
00:04:00,421 --> 00:04:04,200
I find there's something about Canadians
in general that I like.

74
00:04:04,201 --> 00:04:08,370
What is it about Canadians that leads to
a certain pleasant disposition?

75
00:04:08,460 --> 00:04:10,290
Well,
it was so reasonable or so.

76
00:04:10,350 --> 00:04:11,390
Yeah.
I liked her.

77
00:04:11,420 --> 00:04:12,253
Yeah.
Sometimes people say the motto of 

78
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:15,930
candidates,
Peace Order and good government.

79
00:04:17,270 --> 00:04:18,920
Uh,
and uh,

80
00:04:19,210 --> 00:04:20,043
it's a country that is,
that has been diverse for quite some 

81
00:04:23,191 --> 00:04:24,024
time.
A Quebec where I grew up has a English 

82
00:04:26,461 --> 00:04:28,410
speaking community in a French speaking 
community.

83
00:04:28,770 --> 00:04:29,690
And uh,
we've,

84
00:04:29,730 --> 00:04:30,563
we,
we didn't begin with a revolution like 

85
00:04:31,811 --> 00:04:34,650
the United States from negotiated our 
way to independence.

86
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:38,670
Uh,
we're part of the British empire and the

87
00:04:38,670 --> 00:04:43,670
British Commonwealth and kind of have 
that British reserve and a politeness.

88
00:04:44,700 --> 00:04:45,720
Yeah.
So that we have,

89
00:04:45,750 --> 00:04:48,390
we have some things going for us.
A couple of things going for it.

90
00:04:48,391 --> 00:04:50,010
Yeah.
At least until at least the,

91
00:04:50,011 --> 00:04:54,210
all the Americans end up moving up there
if things keep going this way.

92
00:04:54,450 --> 00:04:58,200
Although we might build a wall,
you guys may end up building the wall.

93
00:04:58,201 --> 00:04:59,400
Exactly.
Um,

94
00:04:59,460 --> 00:05:01,920
tell me a little bit about growing up,
your family,

95
00:05:01,940 --> 00:05:03,420
what,
what kind of family you grew up in.

96
00:05:03,780 --> 00:05:04,613
Um,
I grew up in the English speaking a 

97
00:05:07,380 --> 00:05:10,410
section of Montreal in Montreal.
It was pretty segregated when I grew up.

98
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:11,890
I grew up in a,
um,

99
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:12,750
the,
uh,

100
00:05:12,750 --> 00:05:14,010
Jewish,
uh,

101
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:15,780
English speaking community,
uh,

102
00:05:15,781 --> 00:05:18,390
which was known for producing among 
others,

103
00:05:18,530 --> 00:05:21,920
Leonard Cohen,
who was a contemporary of my mother's a,

104
00:05:21,950 --> 00:05:22,783
the authored Mordecai richler who was a 
contemporary of my father's a William 

105
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:27,630
Shatner,
burt Bacharach.

106
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:28,493
Wow.
Um,

107
00:05:29,820 --> 00:05:30,653
the,
um,

108
00:05:31,290 --> 00:05:32,340
uh,
saul bellow,

109
00:05:32,630 --> 00:05:34,440
spare,
disperse his childhood in Montreal.

110
00:05:34,470 --> 00:05:39,060
So it's a small community that has a 
number of people that we're proud of.

111
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:40,420
Yeah.
What do you make of that,

112
00:05:40,430 --> 00:05:41,221
that,
that so many.

113
00:05:41,221 --> 00:05:42,240
I mean,
that's a pretty diverse,

114
00:05:42,241 --> 00:05:43,620
interesting group of people right there.

115
00:05:43,620 --> 00:05:44,830
And I'm sure there are others.
Uh,

116
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:45,753
yeah,
I,

117
00:05:45,770 --> 00:05:46,470
uh,
it,

118
00:05:46,470 --> 00:05:47,303
it,
it may just be that I'm having many 

119
00:05:51,031 --> 00:05:51,864
cultural influences,
both candidates really dominated by the 

120
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:56,033
United States.
It really is the 800 pound gorilla next 

121
00:05:57,110 --> 00:05:58,890
door.
So it's the American influence,

122
00:05:58,891 --> 00:06:00,950
the British influence,
the French influence.

123
00:06:01,130 --> 00:06:01,963
Perhaps it's just being in a 
cosmopolitan diverse community that 

124
00:06:05,541 --> 00:06:06,171
helped with that.
And,

125
00:06:06,171 --> 00:06:07,004
and of course,
the,

126
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:07,730
the,
uh,

127
00:06:07,730 --> 00:06:09,290
the,
the Jewish influence,

128
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:10,750
although it was not,
um,

129
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:12,680
I didn't grow up in.
None of the people that I mentioned grew

130
00:06:12,681 --> 00:06:13,514
up in an ultra orthodox community.
I grew up in a room with a reform 

131
00:06:17,251 --> 00:06:18,300
temple.
Uh,

132
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:19,153
we didn't take God all that seriously,
but we did take Jewish identity 

133
00:06:21,741 --> 00:06:22,970
seriously.
Yeah.

134
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:25,070
I don't remember a moment in which I 
decided,

135
00:06:25,071 --> 00:06:26,120
oh,
I'm an atheist.

136
00:06:26,510 --> 00:06:29,360
I just was not a big issue one way or 
another.

137
00:06:29,450 --> 00:06:32,930
Do you find that to be sort of standard 
thing with most secular Jews?

138
00:06:32,930 --> 00:06:33,763
I think that's sort of at least the ones
that I had been talking to on this show 

139
00:06:36,381 --> 00:06:39,830
that I think are sort of out there more.
That seems to be a thing that there's an

140
00:06:39,831 --> 00:06:44,030
ethnic identity or a cultural identity 
that's separate from the belief part.

141
00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:46,940
Absolutely.
I think that's more true of Judaism than

142
00:06:46,941 --> 00:06:47,774
it is,
say Catholicism where the belief really 

143
00:06:50,121 --> 00:06:53,570
is stipulated in Judaism,
isn't a bit of a kind of don't ask,

144
00:06:53,571 --> 00:06:55,080
don't tell as long as you want,
painful.

145
00:06:55,220 --> 00:06:58,340
As long as we made the laws and rituals,
if you keep the sabbath,

146
00:06:58,341 --> 00:06:58,870
if you have,
you know,

147
00:06:58,870 --> 00:06:59,703
Mazzoni on Passover and then you're a 
good Jew and what you believe is just 

148
00:07:03,171 --> 00:07:04,004
not as important.
One a rabbi said to my wife Rebecca 

149
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:09,980
Goldstein,
another secular Jew,

150
00:07:10,460 --> 00:07:11,350
well known,
uh,

151
00:07:11,630 --> 00:07:13,490
a secular humanist writer,
uh,

152
00:07:13,491 --> 00:07:17,120
when she talked about her novel,
36 arguments for the existence of God,

153
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:18,500
a work of fiction,
which is kind of the.

154
00:07:19,170 --> 00:07:20,003
And she spoke at a Jewish community 
center and that was a little worried 

155
00:07:23,451 --> 00:07:24,284
whether there'd be some pushback from 
the rabbi who introduced her and 

156
00:07:26,271 --> 00:07:27,770
afterwards he went over and he said,
you know,

157
00:07:27,771 --> 00:07:30,110
it's not like in Judaism it says you 
have to believe in God.

158
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:31,910
You just can't believe that more than 
one of them.

159
00:07:33,140 --> 00:07:34,490
That's,
I mean,

160
00:07:34,491 --> 00:07:36,080
that's pretty perfect.
Do you think there's a,

161
00:07:36,081 --> 00:07:36,914
there's an inherent problem there sort 
of disconnecting God from even if it 

162
00:07:41,301 --> 00:07:44,120
really is as well,
just for the longevity of it,

163
00:07:44,210 --> 00:07:45,610
let's say.
Oh yeah.

164
00:07:45,611 --> 00:07:46,630
Uh,
yeah.

165
00:07:46,730 --> 00:07:47,001
It's,
uh,

166
00:07:47,001 --> 00:07:47,834
it's a good question.
I think that may have been part of the 

167
00:07:49,581 --> 00:07:50,414
explanation for why.
I mean there's so many secular Jewish 

168
00:07:52,851 --> 00:07:56,960
intellectuals kind of immersed in 
argument disputation,

169
00:07:56,961 --> 00:08:00,990
particularly about morals and ethics,
but without a bit,

170
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:04,230
but it was all argument disputation.
It wasn't a a,

171
00:08:04,231 --> 00:08:06,260
a catechism that you had to recite.

172
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:08,840
It wasn't a set of beliefs that you have
to have.

173
00:08:08,841 --> 00:08:12,560
So there was a tradition of disputation.
That's what the rabbis were famous for,

174
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:15,240
that the pill pool,
the hair splitting and,

175
00:08:16,330 --> 00:08:18,980
and maybe that was a con contributor as 
well,

176
00:08:19,130 --> 00:08:24,130
but I went to public schools and in fact
when you go to public schools in Quebec,

177
00:08:24,141 --> 00:08:24,974
when,
I mean my childhood meant you went to 

178
00:08:26,420 --> 00:08:29,120
Protestant schools because it was 
divided along religious lines.

179
00:08:29,121 --> 00:08:30,460
There were Protestant schools and 
Catholic.

180
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:31,250
Oh,
interesting.

181
00:08:31,250 --> 00:08:34,370
Protestant meant on Catholic.
Basically everyone else,

182
00:08:34,490 --> 00:08:37,220
including the Muslims and the Jews and 
Chinese and so on.

183
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:39,440
It was a bizarre system.
Yeah.

184
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:40,333
How interesting.
Happily unconstitutional in this 

185
00:08:41,751 --> 00:08:42,980
country.
And I got,

186
00:08:43,010 --> 00:08:43,843
I got.
I actually got a pretty serious 

187
00:08:45,650 --> 00:08:47,900
Protestant religious education.
I saying hymns,

188
00:08:47,930 --> 00:08:50,630
we said the Lord's prayer every day.
I learned about life of Jesus.

189
00:08:50,690 --> 00:08:51,523
So they had the Jews and the Muslims and
everyone was getting a Protestant 

190
00:08:54,571 --> 00:08:54,860
schools.

191
00:08:54,860 --> 00:08:56,330
Yeah.
And at one point I remember I was,

192
00:08:56,331 --> 00:08:57,090
I think it was,
you know,

193
00:08:57,090 --> 00:09:00,060
eight or nine and I actually,
we didn't even belong to a temple.

194
00:09:00,490 --> 00:09:03,270
I said to my mother,
one of my friends said that,

195
00:09:03,580 --> 00:09:04,413
that Jews aren't supposed to believe in 
Jesus my should I not believe in Jesus 

196
00:09:07,321 --> 00:09:08,154
anymore.
She sent me to Hebrew school so fast 

197
00:09:09,921 --> 00:09:13,620
that made my head spin hilarious.
My teachers,

198
00:09:13,770 --> 00:09:16,380
because they couldn't hire Catholic 
teachers either.

199
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:17,333
Uh,
and virtually everyone in Quebec is 

200
00:09:20,110 --> 00:09:22,230
among the Francophone community are 
Catholics.

201
00:09:22,380 --> 00:09:23,213
So they actually hired Algerian and 
Tunisian and Moroccan Jews to teach 

202
00:09:27,871 --> 00:09:29,710
French to the,
uh,

203
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:31,313
Jewish and Protestant kids in Montreal.
The Protestant kids in Montreal did not 

204
00:09:34,321 --> 00:09:39,321
learn French from Native Quebecois.
We looked at from a Egyptian or Tunisian

205
00:09:40,171 --> 00:09:41,940
immigrants.
How bizarre it was.

206
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,160
I'm pretty sure I know the subject of 
your next book.

207
00:09:44,161 --> 00:09:44,994
I mean,
it sounds like there's just so much 

208
00:09:45,511 --> 00:09:48,030
richness to adjusting that,
or at least there's a little,

209
00:09:48,060 --> 00:09:49,370
a little comedy in there.

210
00:09:49,470 --> 00:09:50,303
Like,
it sounds like your family was kinda on 

211
00:09:51,931 --> 00:09:52,764
the intellectual side,
or at least at the county he was in red 

212
00:09:55,050 --> 00:09:57,750
house,
was full of books and magazines.

213
00:09:57,840 --> 00:09:58,673
My,
uh,

214
00:09:58,770 --> 00:09:59,800
my father was,
um,

215
00:09:59,860 --> 00:10:02,220
had a law degree but didn't practice 
when I was a child.

216
00:10:02,221 --> 00:10:06,420
He was a and handled some little bit of 
real estate and did a sales,

217
00:10:06,810 --> 00:10:07,643
uh,
before,

218
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:08,633
uh,
starting a law practice pretty late in 

219
00:10:09,691 --> 00:10:10,524
life.
My mother was like most mothers of the 

220
00:10:12,781 --> 00:10:14,550
fifties and sixties,
a homemaker,

221
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:18,560
but then found a career when she was 
getting bored,

222
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:19,673
uh,
when I became a guidance counselor and 

223
00:10:21,811 --> 00:10:26,310
then the vice principal of high school 
and my mother were Roslyn pinker,

224
00:10:26,420 --> 00:10:30,600
very intellectual and intense reader 
knows everything.

225
00:10:30,970 --> 00:10:34,920
A intellectually very engaged.
Yeah.

226
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:37,080
And my sister,
Susan is a,

227
00:10:37,081 --> 00:10:37,914
uh,
I'm a columnist for the Wall Street 

228
00:10:40,260 --> 00:10:41,093
Journal,
is written in a couple of books on one 

229
00:10:42,551 --> 00:10:45,750
on sex differences,
one on a face to face contact.

230
00:10:46,110 --> 00:10:49,620
My brother Rob,
who I worked for the Canadian government

231
00:10:49,621 --> 00:10:53,430
for several decades as a policy analyst 
and a,

232
00:10:53,431 --> 00:10:54,450
uh,
an administrator.

233
00:10:55,350 --> 00:10:58,980
So how much of the intellectual pursuits
that you all have,

234
00:10:59,010 --> 00:11:02,820
do you think is his biological versus 
just learned experience?

235
00:11:03,030 --> 00:11:03,863
Yeah.
This is one of the themes that keeps 

236
00:11:04,591 --> 00:11:06,370
coming up around these decisions.
And,

237
00:11:06,380 --> 00:11:07,710
and it,
it is a,

238
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:08,633
was a topic of my book,
the blank slate in the modern denial of 

239
00:11:10,771 --> 00:11:11,604
human nature.
The blank slate being the metaphor that 

240
00:11:14,131 --> 00:11:14,964
I argued became dominant and 
intellectual life largely for political 

241
00:11:17,821 --> 00:11:18,654
reasons.
Can you explain that a little bit for 

242
00:11:20,011 --> 00:11:21,270
the people that,
that don't know the book?

243
00:11:21,650 --> 00:11:22,350
Yeah.
So the,

244
00:11:22,350 --> 00:11:23,183
the blank slate,
the modern denial of human nature just 

245
00:11:25,140 --> 00:11:30,140
was released in 2016 with an afterword 
was about the idea that,

246
00:11:30,181 --> 00:11:31,014
uh,
that there is no such thing as human 

247
00:11:32,131 --> 00:11:32,964
nature,
that we are blank slates written on by 

248
00:11:35,971 --> 00:11:36,990
our parents,
my,

249
00:11:37,070 --> 00:11:37,903
by the culture,
by a education and that there's no 

250
00:11:40,770 --> 00:11:44,800
innate human traits or ways of learning 
and thinking it's,

251
00:11:44,810 --> 00:11:45,643
it's a,
you can program a human however you 

252
00:11:47,131 --> 00:11:47,890
want.

253
00:11:47,890 --> 00:11:49,180
Uh,
and uh,

254
00:11:49,181 --> 00:11:53,070
I argued that it was popular in the 20th
century for political reasons.

255
00:11:53,110 --> 00:11:57,970
One of them being that it seems like the
ultimate way to achieve equality,

256
00:11:58,190 --> 00:11:58,760
you know,
if we all,

257
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:00,260
if we're all zero,
then you know,

258
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:03,100
zero equals zero equals zero.
So we all have to be equal,

259
00:12:03,130 --> 00:12:04,690
right?
I already,

260
00:12:04,691 --> 00:12:05,524
this is a mistake in the book that 
equality is really a legal and moral 

261
00:12:08,711 --> 00:12:09,544
principle to treat everyone equally.
It's not really the belief that we're 

262
00:12:12,131 --> 00:12:12,964
all clones were on blank slates and a 
lot of the book try to both layout the 

263
00:12:17,411 --> 00:12:18,244
science of human nature,
but also to explore the political and 

264
00:12:22,001 --> 00:12:26,920
emotional and moral baggage and coloring
and to try to clarify it.

265
00:12:27,190 --> 00:12:31,840
And so the difference between equality 
of treatment and the equality of,

266
00:12:31,870 --> 00:12:32,621
uh,
of,

267
00:12:32,621 --> 00:12:33,454
of our biological endowment was a major 
thing that also of course enters into 

268
00:12:37,590 --> 00:12:42,590
discussion of sex differences where one 
of the reasons that certain intellectual

269
00:12:44,051 --> 00:12:44,884
factions,
certain parts of feminism wants to deny 

270
00:12:48,041 --> 00:12:49,450
that there any sex differences.

271
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:50,513
So I think,
well that will make it impossible to 

272
00:12:51,881 --> 00:12:53,980
discriminate because there's nothing to 
discriminate.

273
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:56,410
We're all exactly the sport exactly the 
same.

274
00:12:56,970 --> 00:12:58,900
And I get that big,
big mistake.

275
00:12:58,910 --> 00:12:59,743
There's first of all,
there is a lot of evidence that men and 

276
00:13:00,911 --> 00:13:04,050
women aren't identical and all traits.
I mean,

277
00:13:04,060 --> 00:13:06,570
I'm not a scientist,
but I think there is a lot of evidence.

278
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:06,990
Agree.
Yeah.

279
00:13:06,990 --> 00:13:07,823
I think anyone who's had a son and a 
daughter who has been in a heterosexual 

280
00:13:10,331 --> 00:13:11,164
relationship,
anyone who's listened to gossip about 

281
00:13:13,121 --> 00:13:15,160
anyone talking about anyone else.
Yeah.

282
00:13:15,190 --> 00:13:17,290
Men and women are really not,
not exactly the same,

283
00:13:17,770 --> 00:13:22,450
but I think the myth that at the same 
was introduced for political purposes,

284
00:13:22,630 --> 00:13:25,930
namely that would make discrimination 
irrational,

285
00:13:26,050 --> 00:13:26,883
right?
Because there's nothing to discriminate 

286
00:13:28,151 --> 00:13:29,030
on.
And I argue that,

287
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:29,500
that,
you know,

288
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:32,060
that's just a error in logic.
Uh,

289
00:13:32,190 --> 00:13:33,023
I strongly believe in,
in gender equity that no one should be 

290
00:13:35,771 --> 00:13:37,810
prejudged because they're a man or a 
woman,

291
00:13:38,020 --> 00:13:38,853
partly because of a scientific fact that
there's huge overlap between the sexes 

292
00:13:42,341 --> 00:13:44,110
in any trade you want to look at.

293
00:13:44,110 --> 00:13:44,943
So you can predict an individual's 
traits just knowing that they're a man 

294
00:13:47,861 --> 00:13:49,000
or a woman,
but they,

295
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:51,400
the policy,
we should be fair.

296
00:13:51,510 --> 00:13:54,790
It doesn't require the false belief that
were the same,

297
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:57,190
that are distinguishable.
What's the best?

298
00:13:57,191 --> 00:13:58,024
Have you heard any argument for that 
belief that you thought made any sense 

299
00:14:01,241 --> 00:14:03,640
or you just were which belief for the 
idea that,

300
00:14:03,870 --> 00:14:05,730
that this,
that these genders are equal?

301
00:14:05,731 --> 00:14:08,290
Like when you must hear this from other 
academics,

302
00:14:08,291 --> 00:14:08,800
right?
I mean,

303
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:11,580
we know that some of this stuff is being
taught at schools.

304
00:14:11,581 --> 00:14:11,891
Yeah.
Well,

305
00:14:11,891 --> 00:14:12,671
there are,
you know,

306
00:14:12,671 --> 00:14:14,470
there's no doubt that there are,
there's enormous,

307
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:16,060
enormous overlap.
Um,

308
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:17,310
there's no doubt.
And,

309
00:14:17,311 --> 00:14:19,640
and some of the differences between the 
sexes are,

310
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:23,380
are pretty small and subtle.
So in say,

311
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:26,530
mathematical ability,
which was one of the most controversial,

312
00:14:26,730 --> 00:14:29,270
uh,
claims about sex differences or it could

313
00:14:29,980 --> 00:14:33,490
lead to a huge firestorm when Larry 
Summers,

314
00:14:33,491 --> 00:14:34,324
the president of Harvard mentioned that 
differences between the sexes might 

315
00:14:37,781 --> 00:14:38,614
explain why the number of engineering 
professors at Harvard and mit wasn't 50 

316
00:14:43,661 --> 00:14:44,710
slash 50 down the line.

317
00:14:44,770 --> 00:14:45,603
Male,
female.

318
00:14:45,910 --> 00:14:48,770
This is very much like the James divorce
situation with,

319
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:50,150
with Google.
It is,

320
00:14:50,230 --> 00:14:51,050
is exactly.
I mean,

321
00:14:51,050 --> 00:14:54,010
it's almost,
it's almost a replay and uh,

322
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:56,390
and,
and it isn't easy.

323
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:57,313
In fact,
it would be hard to say that men or 

324
00:14:58,791 --> 00:14:59,624
women are better at math in general.
It's you have to even drill down to 

325
00:15:01,941 --> 00:15:02,774
certain subcomponents like mentally 
rotating three dimensional objects that 

326
00:15:06,620 --> 00:15:08,880
men are clearly better at,
but women are better at,

327
00:15:08,900 --> 00:15:12,050
at our word,
problems in arithmetic and math.

328
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:13,273
So it's a.
So some of the pushback is that in fact 

329
00:15:15,351 --> 00:15:16,184
the science is often complicated.
You can't make a sweeping across the 

330
00:15:18,831 --> 00:15:19,664
board generalization and then the other 
kind of push back for people who defend 

331
00:15:24,411 --> 00:15:26,000
the blank slate as well.
Yeah,

332
00:15:26,001 --> 00:15:29,360
that's true of 2002 when your book came 
out,

333
00:15:29,390 --> 00:15:32,110
but a society is changing and uh,
you know,

334
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:32,953
more women are,
are consuming porn and more women are 

335
00:15:35,511 --> 00:15:39,440
having multiple sexual partners and 
maybe the differences saying sexuality,

336
00:15:39,860 --> 00:15:41,630
uh,
are due to human nature,

337
00:15:41,780 --> 00:15:42,613
but just due to our culture at a 
particular moment that may become 

338
00:15:45,891 --> 00:15:46,724
obsolete.

339
00:15:46,890 --> 00:15:49,760
And that seems incredibly dangerous to 
me to view it that way.

340
00:15:50,150 --> 00:15:51,490
Well,
maybe,

341
00:15:51,560 --> 00:15:52,520
um,
although,

342
00:15:52,521 --> 00:15:53,354
you know,
you could,

343
00:15:53,750 --> 00:15:57,860
in some ways it's actually highway a 
progressive and even correct because you

344
00:15:57,861 --> 00:15:59,060
could have said,
you know,

345
00:15:59,061 --> 00:16:02,990
70 years ago a women don't want to go 
into the professions.

346
00:16:02,991 --> 00:16:03,610
They,
they,

347
00:16:03,610 --> 00:16:05,870
they want to stay home with the kids.
And Housework,

348
00:16:05,871 --> 00:16:06,704
and that's what makes them complete and 
satisfied and happy and there'll be all 

349
00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:14,560
a neurotic and anxious if they start to 
become lawyers and doctors.

350
00:16:14,900 --> 00:16:16,490
And we know from the course of history 
that,

351
00:16:16,570 --> 00:16:17,420
you know,
that's not true.

352
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:19,790
In fact,
I went as soon as the doors open,

353
00:16:19,820 --> 00:16:22,220
women did pour through the doors.
Um,

354
00:16:22,221 --> 00:16:23,054
and so that would be an example.
Were too strong a claim of biological 

355
00:16:27,261 --> 00:16:29,990
differences would have been refuted by,
by the facts of history.

356
00:16:30,020 --> 00:16:31,100
So it's not a slam dunk.

357
00:16:31,100 --> 00:16:31,933
I mean,
it is something that has to be examined 

358
00:16:33,171 --> 00:16:34,004
on a case by case basis.
Are you shocked at how difficult it is 

359
00:16:36,921 --> 00:16:40,760
to talk about all of this without 
getting yourself yourself or,

360
00:16:40,761 --> 00:16:43,190
or any of the people that talk about it 
into hot water?

361
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:46,370
Yeah.
Nuance that you have to go through here.

362
00:16:46,371 --> 00:16:47,101
As I can see,
you're,

363
00:16:47,101 --> 00:16:49,490
you're quite well versed that you're 
probably the best at it.

364
00:16:49,700 --> 00:16:50,533
It's a lot to make sure that somebody 
can pinpoint that one line that then 

365
00:16:54,261 --> 00:16:57,080
they're going to just drag you for.
Exactly.

366
00:16:57,081 --> 00:16:57,711
Right.
Well,

367
00:16:57,711 --> 00:17:00,860
and the reason that I wrote the blank 
slate was it wasn't so much,

368
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:01,833
it's a chapter on gender,
but the point wasn't just to review the 

369
00:17:04,491 --> 00:17:06,860
literature on gender differences.
It was also to say,

370
00:17:07,220 --> 00:17:08,053
okay,
so what,

371
00:17:08,140 --> 00:17:10,580
how does it matter for our public 
debates?

372
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:16,000
And I also documented in the book how 
even when the book first came out,

373
00:17:16,310 --> 00:17:17,143
there was a history of people being deep
platformed and it down and called know 

374
00:17:21,840 --> 00:17:23,850
all kinds of nasty names,
um,

375
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:25,033
for,
for the view that we're not blank 

376
00:17:26,241 --> 00:17:26,990
slates.

377
00:17:26,990 --> 00:17:27,741
And I said,
well look,

378
00:17:27,741 --> 00:17:32,000
this is based on emotion based on bad 
politics,

379
00:17:32,001 --> 00:17:34,730
not based on the facts.
So I kind of,

380
00:17:35,150 --> 00:17:36,650
I don't know if I want to say defended 
myself,

381
00:17:36,651 --> 00:17:39,350
but I laid out all of these political 
controversies.

382
00:17:39,530 --> 00:17:41,720
So I wasn't blundering into it.
Naive.

383
00:17:41,721 --> 00:17:42,554
I was actually,
that was actually the subject of the 

384
00:17:43,491 --> 00:17:47,240
book sometimes though,
that that can't fully defend you.

385
00:17:47,870 --> 00:17:50,790
And in fact both Larry Summers and Jamie
to more,

386
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:51,953
they almost could have taken their 
speeches and in case in the case of 

387
00:17:54,811 --> 00:17:57,570
Larry Summers,
partly did from the chapter on gender in

388
00:17:57,571 --> 00:18:00,510
the book.
So I managed to escape some trouble that

389
00:18:00,540 --> 00:18:04,650
people who have been repeated the 
arguments got into trouble for.

390
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:05,640
Yeah.
So it's interesting.

391
00:18:05,641 --> 00:18:07,920
You sort of laid out a case beforehand 
to,

392
00:18:07,940 --> 00:18:08,773
to defend yourself.
You did like sort of a preemptive 

393
00:18:10,171 --> 00:18:12,600
strike.
Exactly where someone,

394
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:14,040
both of those guys.

395
00:18:14,260 --> 00:18:16,260
I know James,
I know James personally and he's been in

396
00:18:16,261 --> 00:18:17,094
here.
Whereas like he sort of stumbled into 

397
00:18:18,361 --> 00:18:22,350
this thing and then the reaction,
the way it sort of,

398
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:23,473
it just becomes this bigger beast that 
you end up fighting when you were just 

399
00:18:26,551 --> 00:18:28,980
really trying to talk about science.
Well the science,

400
00:18:28,981 --> 00:18:29,814
I,
I wasn't just talking about the science 

401
00:18:30,721 --> 00:18:33,030
because I was talking about first the 
science.

402
00:18:33,031 --> 00:18:35,670
Then what are the political and moral 
implications,

403
00:18:35,790 --> 00:18:36,623
which I thought got confused feeding 
back on people trying to shoehorn the 

404
00:18:40,861 --> 00:18:41,694
science into a politically correct 
position because they were kind of lazy 

405
00:18:45,121 --> 00:18:45,954
when it came to the politics.
I don't believe in obviously I don't 

406
00:18:48,631 --> 00:18:50,280
believe in discrimination against 
anyone.

407
00:18:50,700 --> 00:18:51,240
Uh,
and,

408
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:52,073
but the point being that having that 
belief doesn't mean that you have to 

409
00:18:54,661 --> 00:18:55,494
insist that were blank slates.
And I made that argument for other 

410
00:18:58,380 --> 00:19:01,620
controversies around human nature,
like,

411
00:19:01,650 --> 00:19:03,990
do we have any violent,
uh,

412
00:19:03,991 --> 00:19:06,720
impulses where there's,
there,

413
00:19:06,730 --> 00:19:09,250
there's a kind of political argument for
different reasons.

414
00:19:09,420 --> 00:19:10,590
And then people think,
well,

415
00:19:10,591 --> 00:19:11,424
if we're innately violent,
then we're kind of doomed to war for 

416
00:19:14,910 --> 00:19:17,550
forever.
And if you try to reduce war,

417
00:19:17,551 --> 00:19:18,384
you're just some romantic piece neck and
it's hopeless and more as in human 

418
00:19:21,421 --> 00:19:23,010
nature.
Therefore,

419
00:19:23,250 --> 00:19:25,660
since war is bad,
uh,

420
00:19:25,780 --> 00:19:28,230
and if we're violent,
then we'll always have war.

421
00:19:28,231 --> 00:19:31,650
We can't be violent.
And I invest is a logical.

422
00:19:31,860 --> 00:19:34,770
We do have violent impulses.
I think that's pretty clear,

423
00:19:34,980 --> 00:19:37,640
but it's not all we have.
We also have a,

424
00:19:37,740 --> 00:19:41,700
have the faculty of self control.
We also have empathy.

425
00:19:41,701 --> 00:19:44,190
We have cognitive processes of problem 
solving,

426
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:45,273
uh,
so we can figure out how we can reduce 

427
00:19:46,411 --> 00:19:48,540
war.
We've got moral norms.

428
00:19:48,541 --> 00:19:50,310
There are just certain things you don't 
do.

429
00:19:50,670 --> 00:19:51,503
And the fact that part of us as violent 
doesn't mean we're doomed to violence 

430
00:19:55,140 --> 00:19:57,450
because part of us pushes back on the 
fire.

431
00:19:57,490 --> 00:19:58,323
Once I cited a statistic that three 
quarters of men and 60 percent of women 

432
00:20:02,790 --> 00:20:05,940
at least once it had a homicidal 
fantasy,

433
00:20:06,370 --> 00:20:07,680
imagined killing someone.

434
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:11,000
They don't like three quarters of men 
and 60 percent of task.

435
00:20:11,210 --> 00:20:12,270
Yeah.
And uh,

436
00:20:12,770 --> 00:20:14,130
and,
and when I,

437
00:20:14,131 --> 00:20:14,964
uh,
I introduced this factor electronic and 

438
00:20:16,381 --> 00:20:16,891
I say,
well,

439
00:20:16,891 --> 00:20:17,724
what does this tell us about human 
nature tells us that three quarters of 

440
00:20:19,651 --> 00:20:22,830
men are liars,
but,

441
00:20:22,860 --> 00:20:24,610
uh,
but I pointed out this,

442
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:25,473
this doesn't mean that trying to 
increase piece is futile because there 

443
00:20:30,001 --> 00:20:31,830
are other parts of human nature we can 
work with.

444
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:34,350
And of course that was what led to my 
more recent book,

445
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:36,450
the better angels of our nature.
That said,

446
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:39,180
not only is it possible it's happened.
Yeah,

447
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:39,890
I bet.
Again,

448
00:20:39,890 --> 00:20:40,723
it's kind of the nexus between the 
political on the one hand and the 

449
00:20:44,671 --> 00:20:47,070
scientific on the other that I was 
exploring.

450
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:47,913
And I talked about how the people who 
thought they were advocates of peace 

451
00:20:51,580 --> 00:20:55,300
tried to squash all evidence that people
have a violent,

452
00:20:55,301 --> 00:20:57,970
uh,
impulses because it was just politically

453
00:20:58,150 --> 00:20:59,110
too uncomfortable.

454
00:20:59,380 --> 00:21:00,720
And I said,
that's first of all,

455
00:21:00,740 --> 00:21:02,860
distorting the science is never a good 
idea.

456
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:07,120
And is it clear about the politics then 
the science doesn't even mean that we've

457
00:21:07,121 --> 00:21:08,470
got to accept war.
Yeah.

458
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:12,280
So for someone that's sort of insulated 
themselves from some of this,

459
00:21:12,310 --> 00:21:14,080
because you were doing the work 
beforehand,

460
00:21:14,081 --> 00:21:16,270
which is actually pretty brilliant 
tactic.

461
00:21:16,660 --> 00:21:17,493
Are you afraid that the hard sciences 
are going to be hit by all of this 

462
00:21:20,951 --> 00:21:21,784
identity politics stuff in a bigger way 
than we're seeing right now when it 

463
00:21:24,131 --> 00:21:27,580
comes to gender or race or,
or any of these issues?

464
00:21:27,820 --> 00:21:31,360
It's not even so much the hard sciences,
but the social sciences,

465
00:21:31,620 --> 00:21:33,910
well we know the social science happen 
hit,

466
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:36,580
but you don't fear that it's going to 
come from the hard sciences to,

467
00:21:36,630 --> 00:21:37,463
well,
that there may be some aspects of 

468
00:21:39,310 --> 00:21:41,440
genetics and brain science that are,
uh,

469
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:45,460
that are feeling the political pressure,
the neuroscience of sex differences,

470
00:21:45,461 --> 00:21:46,294
for example.

471
00:21:46,700 --> 00:21:47,533
Um,
certainly the genetics of intelligence 

472
00:21:50,411 --> 00:21:53,770
and personality have a,
have felt that political pressure.

473
00:21:54,360 --> 00:21:55,280
Yeah.
Uh,

474
00:21:55,380 --> 00:21:55,900
a,
um,

475
00:21:55,900 --> 00:21:57,890
one of my collaborators and former 
students.

476
00:21:57,891 --> 00:22:02,891
So James Lee presented a paper where 
he's part of the consortium that for the

477
00:22:03,491 --> 00:22:08,491
first time identified number of genes 
that were linked to intelligence.

478
00:22:08,930 --> 00:22:12,070
I mean there's no icu gene,
but there are hundreds,

479
00:22:12,860 --> 00:22:13,693
probably thousands of genes that could 
bump your icu up by a fraction of a 

480
00:22:16,811 --> 00:22:17,644
point up or down.
And they have been some of the first 

481
00:22:20,561 --> 00:22:21,394
really hard replicable discoveries 
because there are a lot of bogus 

482
00:22:24,341 --> 00:22:27,340
discoveries in the past.
But this was really solid and there was,

483
00:22:27,380 --> 00:22:28,930
there was pretty,
pretty big pushback,

484
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:32,110
including from the president of the 
society saying,

485
00:22:32,140 --> 00:22:32,920
this is,
this,

486
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:36,160
is this fascist,
this is unacceptable.

487
00:22:36,340 --> 00:22:38,410
Um,
so there was some pushback and this was,

488
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:39,273
this was genetics.
So what do you make of the people that 

489
00:22:41,471 --> 00:22:43,360
focus on like race and Iq?

490
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:43,721
I,
I,

491
00:22:43,721 --> 00:22:45,310
you know,
I've had Stefan Molyneux here.

492
00:22:45,340 --> 00:22:46,680
I don't know if you know who he is,
but he,

493
00:22:46,681 --> 00:22:47,514
he really focuses on that.
And I wanted what I wanted to know from 

494
00:22:50,321 --> 00:22:55,040
him really was not necessarily why it 
really not.

495
00:22:55,180 --> 00:22:58,290
What do you think of this,
but why the focus on that,

496
00:22:58,291 --> 00:22:59,290
that team,
to me,

497
00:22:59,291 --> 00:23:00,820
that's the part I'm more concerned 
about.

498
00:23:00,830 --> 00:23:01,790
Yeah,
I think it's.

499
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:04,630
I think it's an excellent question and 
it's one that,

500
00:23:04,631 --> 00:23:06,210
uh,
that um,

501
00:23:06,340 --> 00:23:07,810
uh,
torments me.

502
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:08,673
I mean,
on the one hand you could make the 

503
00:23:09,431 --> 00:23:10,840
argument,
well,

504
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:14,710
we should not be afraid of the truth.
And for that matter of vigorous,

505
00:23:14,940 --> 00:23:19,150
a exploration of the genetics of racial 
differences might show that there are no

506
00:23:19,151 --> 00:23:19,984
genetic differences relevant to 
personality or intelligence and that 

507
00:23:22,181 --> 00:23:24,250
would give races have a really decisive 
blow.

508
00:23:24,590 --> 00:23:26,950
But the other hand,
you never know that before you look.

509
00:23:27,270 --> 00:23:28,930
So you can't count on that.
You've of course,

510
00:23:28,931 --> 00:23:29,764
if you do science,
you got to be prepared for any 

511
00:23:30,731 --> 00:23:32,080
possibility.
There is,

512
00:23:32,081 --> 00:23:32,914
I think,
a legitimate question of whether we 

513
00:23:33,881 --> 00:23:35,890
really should be getting to the bottom 
of this.

514
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:38,620
It's an argument that actually goes back
to my old mit colleague,

515
00:23:38,650 --> 00:23:42,220
Noam Chomsky way back in the 19 
seventies said,

516
00:23:42,250 --> 00:23:43,083
uh,
we can't insist that the truth one way 

517
00:23:45,471 --> 00:23:48,560
or another because that's just contrary 
to the whole spirit of science.

518
00:23:48,740 --> 00:23:49,573
But we don't have to ask every question,
a lot of questions that are 

519
00:23:51,651 --> 00:23:52,484
scientifically pretty minor,
they could have socially damaging 

520
00:23:56,001 --> 00:23:59,180
consequences.
So let's put them really low on the list

521
00:23:59,240 --> 00:24:00,470
and he suggested that,
uh,

522
00:24:00,471 --> 00:24:02,840
that racing Iq,
for example,

523
00:24:03,080 --> 00:24:03,913
is,
should not be an interest in a society 

524
00:24:05,931 --> 00:24:06,764
that treats people as individuals 
because then it's just like a 

525
00:24:08,631 --> 00:24:11,360
correlation between any two traits and 
that,

526
00:24:11,390 --> 00:24:12,130
uh,
that,

527
00:24:12,130 --> 00:24:16,130
that we should just be a low priority 
and something that we should ignore.

528
00:24:16,220 --> 00:24:18,720
Now that's a little bit.
Um,

529
00:24:19,220 --> 00:24:20,053
uh,
I think it ignores the fact that there 

530
00:24:22,251 --> 00:24:23,084
are people who already are dividing 
humans by race and by measuring the 

531
00:24:27,471 --> 00:24:32,210
outcomes and attributing it to poverty 
or racism.

532
00:24:32,540 --> 00:24:33,710
And then you kind of say,
well,

533
00:24:33,740 --> 00:24:34,041
Gee,
if,

534
00:24:34,041 --> 00:24:36,380
as long as we were raising the question 
at all,

535
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:37,393
should we look at all the hypotheses,
it might even be an argument for just 

536
00:24:39,921 --> 00:24:42,260
downplaying race in general.
Uh,

537
00:24:42,290 --> 00:24:46,880
instead of dividing us up by race and 
obsessive measuring the differences,

538
00:24:47,300 --> 00:24:51,430
I'm looking at things like class and 
income because that that's really what,

539
00:24:51,530 --> 00:24:52,363
what matters more and just not make 
everything a racial issue in the first 

540
00:24:55,191 --> 00:24:56,024
place so that whether the racial issue 
is from biology kind of fades and 

541
00:24:59,451 --> 00:25:00,540
importance.
Yeah.

542
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:03,740
You mentioned the nexus of politics and 
science.

543
00:25:03,741 --> 00:25:04,574
I really like that phrase because I 
think there's so many of the 

544
00:25:05,841 --> 00:25:07,280
conversations I'm having here.

545
00:25:07,490 --> 00:25:08,323
It seems to me that politics and science
are really just linked all the time and 

546
00:25:11,511 --> 00:25:15,890
it explains why so many people want to 
talk to you and why they want to talk to

547
00:25:15,891 --> 00:25:18,710
the Weinstein brothers and Sam Harris 
and so many other people.

548
00:25:19,370 --> 00:25:22,280
Are you a little concerned that it's 
becoming so political?

549
00:25:22,660 --> 00:25:23,940
Yeah,
I mean,

550
00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:26,510
part of it is that it's that what,
what,

551
00:25:26,670 --> 00:25:27,503
uh,
what I'm doing and what some of the 

552
00:25:28,461 --> 00:25:29,294
other your other guests have been doing 
is to try to depoliticize some of the 

553
00:25:31,521 --> 00:25:32,354
scientific issues and certainly what I 
tried to do in the blank slate or 

554
00:25:37,190 --> 00:25:40,290
clarify what the political issues are 
not.

555
00:25:40,360 --> 00:25:42,370
It's almost impossible these days right.
It,

556
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:44,120
it is becoming a little bit,
uh,

557
00:25:44,390 --> 00:25:45,223
well,
it's,

558
00:25:45,290 --> 00:25:48,020
the landscape is really diverse and 
divided.

559
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:48,913
I mean there are the very,
the identity politicians in the social 

560
00:25:52,281 --> 00:25:56,750
justice warriors and the political 
correctness police who are making things

561
00:25:56,751 --> 00:25:58,040
as political as possible.

562
00:25:58,250 --> 00:25:59,083
I mean they'd been around for a long 
time when I was a student in the 

563
00:26:00,561 --> 00:26:01,394
seventies,
there were plenty of people who are 

564
00:26:03,590 --> 00:26:07,910
shouting things like fascists don't have
the right to speak or chanting mobs that

565
00:26:07,911 --> 00:26:08,744
shut down a Harvard colleague,
Eo Wilson when he published 

566
00:26:11,841 --> 00:26:14,030
sociobiology.
So this isn't a new thing.

567
00:26:14,330 --> 00:26:15,163
Uh,
and there are certainly constituencies 

568
00:26:17,300 --> 00:26:18,133
that are totally opened to 
depoliticizing the science and 

569
00:26:21,651 --> 00:26:23,570
considering the politics on its own 
terms.

570
00:26:23,810 --> 00:26:24,643
But on the other hand,
there is a fringe that appears to be 

571
00:26:26,961 --> 00:26:28,170
more radical than ever.
Yeah.

572
00:26:28,410 --> 00:26:31,040
How do you decide how much weight that 
fringe has?

573
00:26:31,041 --> 00:26:32,750
That seems to be one of the themes these
days.

574
00:26:32,770 --> 00:26:33,603
It seems to be very hard to tell.
Is this just this small group that's 

575
00:26:35,901 --> 00:26:39,920
screaming a lot or,
or has it truly infected?

576
00:26:40,310 --> 00:26:41,630
Not only a ton of,
you know,

577
00:26:41,780 --> 00:26:44,670
the millennial generation and had a huge
swath of young people,

578
00:26:44,850 --> 00:26:45,683
but that also it does seem to be 
creeping up or creeping down depending 

579
00:26:48,031 --> 00:26:48,864
on which way you look at it.

580
00:26:49,290 --> 00:26:52,110
A ton of academics at universities and 
all sorts of,

581
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:54,780
all sorts of other people that actually 
have power.

582
00:26:55,170 --> 00:26:56,003
Well,
I think the academics have been 

583
00:26:58,261 --> 00:27:00,290
distorted for quite some time.
Uh,

584
00:27:00,630 --> 00:27:01,690
and this is a,
a,

585
00:27:01,691 --> 00:27:02,524
a,
an idea that's been pushed by Jonathan 

586
00:27:04,290 --> 00:27:06,390
Heit tetlock.
Jose Duarte.

587
00:27:06,660 --> 00:27:08,650
I'm sure a lot of stern.
They had a,

588
00:27:08,700 --> 00:27:12,300
a pretty widely discussed article that,
uh,

589
00:27:12,470 --> 00:27:13,303
the title,
something like viewpoint diversity will 

590
00:27:14,191 --> 00:27:17,280
help social science with a,
gave a number of cases,

591
00:27:17,460 --> 00:27:18,293
some of which I had discussed in the 
blank slate of how just the questions 

592
00:27:21,450 --> 00:27:22,283
that a psychologist ask the,
the items they put on their 

593
00:27:25,051 --> 00:27:25,884
questionnaires,
the way they frame issues just clearly 

594
00:27:29,011 --> 00:27:33,900
has a left wing bias that they argued 
that if there were also people,

595
00:27:33,990 --> 00:27:38,730
conservatives in more of them in psych 
departments than they would have pointed

596
00:27:38,731 --> 00:27:39,300
out,
Hey,

597
00:27:39,300 --> 00:27:40,133
your questionnaire is flawed and that 
the actual quality of the science would 

598
00:27:43,531 --> 00:27:44,160
improved.

599
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:46,800
And to the credit of my field of 
psychology,

600
00:27:47,140 --> 00:27:50,790
there are paper was published in a 
journal where there are 30 commentaries,

601
00:27:50,910 --> 00:27:55,200
so 30 people had a chance to go after 
them or teams.

602
00:27:55,410 --> 00:27:56,370
And it was,
it was,

603
00:27:56,520 --> 00:27:58,110
there was disagreement,
but was very respectful.

604
00:27:58,111 --> 00:28:02,130
They weren't call any nasty names and it
was a really good debate.

605
00:28:02,570 --> 00:28:04,130
Um,
but the,

606
00:28:04,300 --> 00:28:06,210
the question that you asked about how is
this,

607
00:28:06,211 --> 00:28:07,230
uh,
are the,

608
00:28:07,290 --> 00:28:08,123
the,
uh,

609
00:28:08,250 --> 00:28:09,083
totally illiberal and radical movements,
the ones that just shouting down 

610
00:28:15,481 --> 00:28:17,460
speakers sometimes physically assault 
them.

611
00:28:18,450 --> 00:28:19,283
Is that the whole millennial generation 
or is that just a increasingly vocal 

612
00:28:22,681 --> 00:28:23,960
fringe?
Uh,

613
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:24,993
my,
my mind was changed just a couple of 

614
00:28:25,831 --> 00:28:30,180
days ago when I read an article in vox 
about a new study,

615
00:28:30,260 --> 00:28:34,110
a Sam Harris had center to me saying 
that actually support for free speech is

616
00:28:34,170 --> 00:28:35,003
increasing,
including the article you saw the 

617
00:28:36,961 --> 00:28:38,860
article so that,
you know,

618
00:28:38,910 --> 00:28:41,010
that I wasn't,
I was kind of surprised.

619
00:28:41,010 --> 00:28:41,843
I wasn't totally shocked because at 
least my experience at Harvard is that 

620
00:28:44,731 --> 00:28:46,410
the students are,
uh,

621
00:28:46,650 --> 00:28:49,590
all the ones that I've interacted with,
admittedly a biased sample,

622
00:28:49,830 --> 00:28:52,650
but they are perfectly supportive of 
debate,

623
00:28:52,680 --> 00:28:54,030
free speech,
openness.

624
00:28:54,270 --> 00:28:55,140
So it's interesting.
So I,

625
00:28:55,141 --> 00:28:56,090
I mentioned,
uh,

626
00:28:56,130 --> 00:28:59,270
right before we started that I spoke at 
Harvard through the open issues,

627
00:28:59,380 --> 00:29:01,380
right.
And it was a wonderful group and I,

628
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:03,780
and it was clear that they were 
politically diverse and,

629
00:29:03,781 --> 00:29:06,240
and all the other diversity that 
everyone likes,

630
00:29:06,241 --> 00:29:07,680
but that I don't care about that much.
But,

631
00:29:08,020 --> 00:29:10,650
uh,
afterwards we went to a dinner and there

632
00:29:10,651 --> 00:29:13,710
were about 30 or 40 kids.
I was with Bret Weinstein actually.

633
00:29:14,010 --> 00:29:16,050
And uh,
I asked them like,

634
00:29:16,051 --> 00:29:16,884
what do you guys do?
Are you guys okay with saying what you 

635
00:29:18,781 --> 00:29:19,614
think and do you think it's going to 
hurt your grades or hurt your 

636
00:29:21,031 --> 00:29:23,610
friendship?
And virtually everyone said yes.

637
00:29:23,850 --> 00:29:26,240
So I'm still struggling with this 
because I did read it.

638
00:29:26,250 --> 00:29:27,560
They said,
they said yeah,

639
00:29:28,030 --> 00:29:29,730
we would either hurt them or they've 
lost friends.

640
00:29:30,100 --> 00:29:30,933
Mostly I sent,
most of them were kind of libertarian 

641
00:29:33,061 --> 00:29:34,680
ish,
kind of live and let live.

642
00:29:34,810 --> 00:29:36,060
But,
but certainly not all of them,

643
00:29:36,061 --> 00:29:38,850
but,
but virtually everyone at the table said

644
00:29:38,851 --> 00:29:41,010
that they either were afraid to say 
certain things,

645
00:29:41,110 --> 00:29:41,943
friends or certainly two professors.
So that's why when I read the articles 

646
00:29:44,531 --> 00:29:48,100
like that at box and I go to these 
campuses and I hear this consistently,

647
00:29:48,550 --> 00:29:49,383
it's just hard to grade and I,
and that's exactly why I'm posing the 

648
00:29:51,791 --> 00:29:52,980
question to you.
Yeah.

649
00:29:53,020 --> 00:29:55,930
It's just hard to pin this article was 
a,

650
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:57,540
was an eye opening.
They go,

651
00:29:57,690 --> 00:30:01,900
went against the narrative that the 
millennial generation,

652
00:30:01,901 --> 00:30:03,880
are they a bunch of snowflakes that a 
bunch of,

653
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:05,073
of,
of uh,

654
00:30:05,290 --> 00:30:08,230
cultural revolutionaries,
warriors.

655
00:30:08,500 --> 00:30:09,460
Uh,
it's just,

656
00:30:09,620 --> 00:30:11,920
uh,
there certainly is that faction,

657
00:30:11,950 --> 00:30:13,360
but it may not,
uh,

658
00:30:13,900 --> 00:30:17,110
characterize our,
our era altogether.

659
00:30:17,170 --> 00:30:18,003
Yeah.
Have you thought at all about how much 

660
00:30:18,761 --> 00:30:21,570
social media is a piece of this puzzle?
Well,

661
00:30:21,580 --> 00:30:22,380
I don't know.
And that's,

662
00:30:22,380 --> 00:30:23,213
you know,
nowadays everything is blamed on social 

663
00:30:24,941 --> 00:30:26,400
media,
kind of like,

664
00:30:26,440 --> 00:30:27,273
you know,
what the role of El Nino and then nine 

665
00:30:28,831 --> 00:30:30,380
slash 11 happened.
I believe it.

666
00:30:31,280 --> 00:30:33,640
That was all my space.
Yeah,

667
00:30:33,750 --> 00:30:34,950
right.
Yeah.

668
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:36,170
I don't know.
A lot of this I think,

669
00:30:36,550 --> 00:30:39,040
predated social media.
I think that,

670
00:30:39,041 --> 00:30:41,920
uh,
a cable news networks had,

671
00:30:41,980 --> 00:30:43,260
had a role,
um,

672
00:30:43,300 --> 00:30:46,120
Fox News in particular because it was so
politicized,

673
00:30:46,440 --> 00:30:48,860
uh,
in a way that no previous network really

674
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:49,713
had been.
And there are studies showing that when 

675
00:30:52,030 --> 00:30:52,863
a town gets Fox News and you could do 
the natural experiment because some 

676
00:30:56,411 --> 00:30:57,244
towns got it before others just because 
of the way cable companies offered 

677
00:30:59,231 --> 00:31:01,510
different packages for no particular 
reason.

678
00:31:01,950 --> 00:31:02,783
Uh,
you could tell the towns that got Fox 

679
00:31:04,780 --> 00:31:08,830
News became more polarized and became a 
and shifted to the right.

680
00:31:09,100 --> 00:31:09,933
So it really did have a causal effect.
That's one case where it's not just 

681
00:31:11,741 --> 00:31:12,990
correlational.
Yeah.

682
00:31:13,210 --> 00:31:14,860
So you,
you had a strange,

683
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:18,760
a moment about a month or two ago,
about two months ago now,

684
00:31:18,761 --> 00:31:19,594
were you,
you said something to the effect of you 

685
00:31:21,481 --> 00:31:22,314
when someone asks you a question at a 
panel about the alt right and in and in 

686
00:31:25,181 --> 00:31:28,230
effect you said,
but I don't want to put words in mouth.

687
00:31:28,231 --> 00:31:28,491
What,
what,

688
00:31:28,491 --> 00:31:29,321
what did you say?
Well,

689
00:31:29,321 --> 00:31:30,154
this was,
I don't want to butcher open campus 

690
00:31:31,061 --> 00:31:31,820
initiative.
Oh,

691
00:31:31,820 --> 00:31:34,080
it was it.
They were the ones that are.

692
00:31:34,120 --> 00:31:34,931
Okay.
There you go.

693
00:31:34,931 --> 00:31:36,990
So I know this is a good group of people
you were sitting with.

694
00:31:37,040 --> 00:31:38,110
It wasn't the.
And the,

695
00:31:38,111 --> 00:31:39,370
uh,
topic of the event was,

696
00:31:39,371 --> 00:31:42,220
did political correctness help elect 
trump?

697
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:44,650
It was held almost on the anniversary of
the,

698
00:31:44,651 --> 00:31:45,910
uh,
16 election.

699
00:31:46,390 --> 00:31:47,223
And uh,
I suggest that I thought it did in part 

700
00:31:49,271 --> 00:31:50,540
because the,
uh,

701
00:31:50,830 --> 00:31:54,040
when you have certain ideas that are 
just not discussable,

702
00:31:54,430 --> 00:31:55,330
uh,
on,

703
00:31:55,390 --> 00:31:57,010
on,
on campus,

704
00:31:57,070 --> 00:31:57,903
and you've got a savvy,
interconnected community as the 

705
00:32:00,641 --> 00:32:01,780
original.
All right,

706
00:32:01,781 --> 00:32:06,460
where a lot of people associate alt 
right with the torch carrying skinheads.

707
00:32:06,700 --> 00:32:07,533
But what I had in mind was the,
the term as it originally applied to 

708
00:32:10,601 --> 00:32:12,950
internet discussion groups.
Uh,

709
00:32:13,330 --> 00:32:14,310
and that,
uh,

710
00:32:14,630 --> 00:32:15,463
the,
the danger of restricting debate on a 

711
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:18,033
campus of,
of making certain ideas taboo is that 

712
00:32:20,291 --> 00:32:24,610
when smart people do stumble upon them,
then they are,

713
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:25,553
number one,
are a completely alienated from the 

714
00:32:28,150 --> 00:32:30,520
mainstream intellectual life because 
they think,

715
00:32:30,521 --> 00:32:33,210
well,
this is a truth that they can't handle a

716
00:32:33,220 --> 00:32:35,670
what other truths can't they?
Uh,

717
00:32:35,980 --> 00:32:36,813
and they,
since the ideas never get the kind of 

718
00:32:39,920 --> 00:32:40,753
push back and contextualize nation and 
counter-arguments kind of thing that 

719
00:32:44,631 --> 00:32:45,464
you,
that you want for any idea never 

720
00:32:46,851 --> 00:32:47,390
happens.

721
00:32:47,390 --> 00:32:48,223
And within this likeminded community 
they sometimes jump to the most extreme 

722
00:32:51,351 --> 00:32:54,620
conclusions because it's sort of a self,
a self fulfilling prophecy of sewers.

723
00:32:54,630 --> 00:32:58,130
Yeah.
So an example being gender differences,

724
00:32:58,160 --> 00:33:02,060
if it's taboo even to mention the 
possibility that men and women differ,

725
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:06,380
then you stumble across some pretty good
scientific evidence that they do a,

726
00:33:06,620 --> 00:33:07,560
then you might be like,
you know,

727
00:33:07,580 --> 00:33:09,110
Milo Yiannopoulos saying,
oh,

728
00:33:09,111 --> 00:33:09,920
we should,
we should,

729
00:33:09,920 --> 00:33:10,753
uh,
have fewer women in medical school 

730
00:33:12,081 --> 00:33:13,880
because they just going to drop out and 
have babies.

731
00:33:14,270 --> 00:33:14,620
Now,
I mean,

732
00:33:14,620 --> 00:33:18,160
that's a totally idiotic idea.
Um,

733
00:33:18,380 --> 00:33:19,213
but the reason that,
that he could put forward an idiotic 

734
00:33:20,811 --> 00:33:24,860
idea is that since the whole existence 
of sex differences never discussed,

735
00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:28,220
no one ever said that's an idiotic idea.
And likewise,

736
00:33:28,250 --> 00:33:29,083
and there are a number of other facts 
that are kind of undiscussable that you 

737
00:33:32,151 --> 00:33:35,180
can take to extreme conclusions if 
you're not challenged.

738
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:37,160
Whereas if you bring them out into the 
open,

739
00:33:37,370 --> 00:33:42,370
then you can put them into perspective.
Sunlight is the best disinfectant and in

740
00:33:42,381 --> 00:33:43,214
many cases it is.
Another example is that the rates of 

741
00:33:45,141 --> 00:33:48,830
crime differ between blacks and whites.
Now,

742
00:33:48,831 --> 00:33:51,290
if that's a fact that's almost 
undiscussable,

743
00:33:51,291 --> 00:33:53,340
but just go to FBI.gov.
look up.

744
00:33:53,590 --> 00:33:57,890
They break down rates of a of a crime by
age,

745
00:33:57,891 --> 00:33:58,850
by race,
by state,

746
00:33:58,851 --> 00:34:00,530
and you know there it is.
Now,

747
00:34:00,531 --> 00:34:05,531
if you have never even noticed that,
then you can say,

748
00:34:05,660 --> 00:34:06,493
Oh gee,
I wonder if you know African Americans 

749
00:34:07,570 --> 00:34:08,403
are innately more violent than white.
That's completely wrong because we know 

750
00:34:11,541 --> 00:34:12,374
that no two ethnic groups ever have the 
same crime rate and they can shift over 

751
00:34:16,311 --> 00:34:17,144
time.
It used to be the Irish that were the 

752
00:34:18,490 --> 00:34:23,170
that had sky high rates of violence 
compared to a non Irish and we know that

753
00:34:23,180 --> 00:34:26,300
that vanished over time and the black 
white differences might as well,

754
00:34:26,570 --> 00:34:31,100
but that second fact,
namely ethnic and racial differences are

755
00:34:31,101 --> 00:34:33,050
ubiquitous and they can change with 
time.

756
00:34:33,560 --> 00:34:34,393
We'll never even get mentioned if the 
mere fact that there is a difference is 

757
00:34:37,551 --> 00:34:39,860
unmentionable in the first place.
So that was my argument.

758
00:34:40,130 --> 00:34:42,620
I gave some other examples anyway,
that was,

759
00:34:42,760 --> 00:34:43,593
um,
then there's a doctored film clip on 

760
00:34:45,441 --> 00:34:47,360
some outright sites saying,
oh,

761
00:34:47,361 --> 00:34:50,210
see pinker's saying that the operators 
is correct.

762
00:34:50,310 --> 00:34:52,220
That is actually saying,
how can we,

763
00:34:52,820 --> 00:34:55,160
how can we starve the offer right now?
We're,

764
00:34:55,161 --> 00:34:55,611
we're,
we're,

765
00:34:55,611 --> 00:34:56,360
we're,
uh,

766
00:34:56,360 --> 00:34:59,690
we're feeding them inadvertently.
You were basically,

767
00:34:59,691 --> 00:35:00,524
I mean,
just for the layman that's watching 

768
00:35:01,221 --> 00:35:01,551
this.
I mean,

769
00:35:01,551 --> 00:35:02,384
you were basically saying allow for more
information so that those bad ideas 

770
00:35:06,411 --> 00:35:08,630
won't be able to flourish.
I mean,

771
00:35:08,631 --> 00:35:11,660
that is sort of one o one version.
That was the whole point.

772
00:35:11,661 --> 00:35:13,040
Exactly.
Then it was,

773
00:35:13,070 --> 00:35:13,903
it was,
uh,

774
00:35:14,150 --> 00:35:19,150
edited to leave out that parts and then 
the kind of regressive left picked up on

775
00:35:20,001 --> 00:35:20,834
it to,
to also suggest that I was sympathetic 

776
00:35:22,671 --> 00:35:23,504
to the alt right,
which is most bizarre attribution you 

777
00:35:26,481 --> 00:35:27,050
could imagine.

778
00:35:27,050 --> 00:35:30,260
And indeed,
enlightenment now has a whole chapter on

779
00:35:30,261 --> 00:35:31,220
why the,
uh,

780
00:35:31,221 --> 00:35:33,030
the alt right is,
um,

781
00:35:33,490 --> 00:35:37,580
it has gone off the off the rails.
Unfortunately,

782
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:41,820
this misconception after a couple of 
days after the day was corrected,

783
00:35:41,821 --> 00:35:45,840
both in the New York Times and the 
Guardian in England,

784
00:35:46,090 --> 00:35:46,923
I may.
They came to my defense and set things 

785
00:35:48,451 --> 00:35:50,250
right,
but it wasn't bizarre.

786
00:35:50,370 --> 00:35:54,450
A episode of how has the Times putting 
social media makes you stupid.

787
00:35:55,340 --> 00:35:56,280
Precisely.
All right,

788
00:35:56,281 --> 00:35:57,640
so I do want to spend our whole second.
Okay.

789
00:35:58,020 --> 00:35:58,853
Talking about the book,
but very quickly just when you dealt 

790
00:36:00,481 --> 00:36:02,400
with that whole thing.
I mean I remember reading it and I think

791
00:36:02,401 --> 00:36:06,180
there was something in an odd way.
I think the reaction between,

792
00:36:06,181 --> 00:36:07,900
as you said,
the regressive left and the right,

793
00:36:07,901 --> 00:36:09,360
that they were sort of teaming up on 
you.

794
00:36:09,370 --> 00:36:12,960
Again.
I thought it was in a weird way,

795
00:36:12,961 --> 00:36:13,794
even though I know it probably 
personally for you is no fun and you 

796
00:36:16,171 --> 00:36:18,920
probably had all sorts of people saying 
terrible things to you and all,

797
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:19,793
all of that.

798
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:21,233
That I thought if anyone has read any of
Stephen's books or even remotely knows 

799
00:36:24,961 --> 00:36:25,794
what this guy is doing that I think I 
don't know what you consider yourself 

800
00:36:28,201 --> 00:36:29,034
politically.
You strike me as sort of an old school 

801
00:36:30,601 --> 00:36:31,900
liberal.
I don't want to,

802
00:36:32,350 --> 00:36:34,800
I'm putting out there that if you 
centrist moderate,

803
00:36:34,801 --> 00:36:35,634
I have,
I have sympathies to different policies 

804
00:36:37,411 --> 00:36:38,310
and uh,
but yeah,

805
00:36:38,311 --> 00:36:39,970
I'm,
I'm pretty eclectic and centrist.

806
00:36:40,010 --> 00:36:40,843
Yeah.
So that,

807
00:36:40,910 --> 00:36:41,743
that basically I thought this guy,
so obviously just decent and coming at 

808
00:36:44,881 --> 00:36:45,714
this from a,
from a scientific perspective that if 

809
00:36:47,311 --> 00:36:49,340
this is what they're going to do,
where at,

810
00:36:49,360 --> 00:36:53,480
where you say one line,
this is going to destroy.

811
00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:55,510
I mean really my feeling was he could 
destroy,

812
00:36:55,511 --> 00:36:56,344
like the fabric of society really if we 
just start picking off everybody and 

813
00:36:59,491 --> 00:37:01,560
I've seen a lot of instances of this and
this,

814
00:37:01,561 --> 00:37:02,394
you know,
when I've talked to when I've talked to 

815
00:37:03,900 --> 00:37:04,733
or I've talked to Bret Weinstein or 
Lindsay Shepherd from Lori a up in 

816
00:37:07,561 --> 00:37:09,350
Canada and a few others that they.

817
00:37:09,510 --> 00:37:10,343
But I thought yours was just such an 
example of this is so ridiculous as 

818
00:37:13,010 --> 00:37:15,060
well.
So perhaps there was a nice push back to

819
00:37:15,061 --> 00:37:16,660
it maybe.
And that was,

820
00:37:16,710 --> 00:37:18,780
that was exactly the New York Times 
response.

821
00:37:18,781 --> 00:37:20,960
I mean,
that's why they titled the op Ed.

822
00:37:21,060 --> 00:37:23,030
Um,
by that Jesse Singal,

823
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:25,380
how social media makes them stupid.
Yeah.

824
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:27,153
Alright.
Let's talk about the book right here in 

825
00:37:28,261 --> 00:37:29,580
front of me.
Enlightenment.

826
00:37:29,581 --> 00:37:30,414
Now I've been kicking around this phrase
on twitter that's called a little 

827
00:37:32,881 --> 00:37:33,714
traction that we are now in the 
enlightened because it seems like we're 

828
00:37:36,961 --> 00:37:40,870
in this endless stream of constant 
stupidity and I,

829
00:37:40,871 --> 00:37:41,704
and some of it seems social media 
related and we touched a little bit on 

830
00:37:44,251 --> 00:37:45,570
that in part one.
And when I'm saying it,

831
00:37:45,571 --> 00:37:46,404
I'm saying it a little tongue in cheek 
and actually this book is sort of the 

832
00:37:50,190 --> 00:37:51,023
answer to I think what I'm calling the 
enlightenment that there are so many 

833
00:37:53,551 --> 00:37:57,150
good things happening right now and it,
and it's very hopeful and optimistic.

834
00:37:57,150 --> 00:37:59,130
And I always tell people I'm an 
optimist,

835
00:37:59,131 --> 00:38:01,110
otherwise I couldn't do this.
You know what I mean?

836
00:38:01,111 --> 00:38:03,990
I,
I feel that there's a chance we can make

837
00:38:03,991 --> 00:38:05,970
things better.
So first off,

838
00:38:05,980 --> 00:38:07,670
let's just do some one on one stuff.
You're,

839
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:10,650
what our enlightenment values to you.
Well,

840
00:38:10,651 --> 00:38:11,484
I,
I characterize them in the subtitle of 

841
00:38:13,471 --> 00:38:18,471
book as reason science humanism and 
progress reason that we should,

842
00:38:19,350 --> 00:38:21,690
uh,
analyze our situation,

843
00:38:21,691 --> 00:38:22,524
our predicament,
a using the most rigorous a logic that 

844
00:38:26,461 --> 00:38:29,670
we can.
And rather than relying on dogma,

845
00:38:29,671 --> 00:38:31,260
authority,
tradition,

846
00:38:31,290 --> 00:38:35,800
scripture,
I'm not going for social media advocacy,

847
00:38:36,100 --> 00:38:36,933
social media,
although at least throwing ideas out 

848
00:38:38,591 --> 00:38:41,140
there as long as they get evaluated,
as long as they had criticized,

849
00:38:41,420 --> 00:38:42,253
I'm a science,
that namely that we should test our 

850
00:38:46,571 --> 00:38:47,404
hypotheses,
seat deep explanations and that science 

851
00:38:50,410 --> 00:38:54,520
provides us not just with a gadgets and 
cures for disease,

852
00:38:54,521 --> 00:38:56,080
although it's important that it does 
that,

853
00:38:56,230 --> 00:38:59,770
but also defines our,
our human condition,

854
00:39:00,430 --> 00:39:03,100
that concepts from science,
like evolution,

855
00:39:03,160 --> 00:39:05,980
like entropy,
like the whole naturalistic world view,

856
00:39:05,981 --> 00:39:09,520
that the laws of nature do their thing 
without caring about us.

857
00:39:09,730 --> 00:39:14,730
These are things that we have to 
understand as the most basic facts about

858
00:39:15,731 --> 00:39:16,564
our existence.
So science is has to be part of our 

859
00:39:18,611 --> 00:39:19,444
world to you.
Then humanism is the idea that it's 

860
00:39:22,090 --> 00:39:26,340
human beings and other sentient animals 
that deserve our,

861
00:39:26,390 --> 00:39:27,223
our our moral concern as opposed to they
say the glory of the tribe or following 

862
00:39:32,370 --> 00:39:33,203
a caring it,
religious dictates or the faith or some 

863
00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:40,840
messianic age that it's just,
do people live long,

864
00:39:40,841 --> 00:39:41,740
healthy,
happy,

865
00:39:42,010 --> 00:39:43,990
stimulating lives.
That's what we should care about.

866
00:39:44,300 --> 00:39:48,550
And then progress is that if we use 
reason and science to make people better

867
00:39:48,551 --> 00:39:50,440
off,
well maybe we can gradually succeed.

868
00:39:50,620 --> 00:39:51,760
Yeah.
So it's funny when I,

869
00:39:51,780 --> 00:39:56,620
when I was reading this and the only 
word that like dinged a little something

870
00:39:56,621 --> 00:39:57,454
in my head was progress.
And I think it's partly because of the 

871
00:40:00,491 --> 00:40:04,210
way progressives have used progress that
progress in and of itself.

872
00:40:04,270 --> 00:40:07,480
You want to progress meeting have more 
and more opportunity for people more and

873
00:40:07,481 --> 00:40:08,314
more equality for people.
I think that's a far cry from what I 

874
00:40:10,541 --> 00:40:11,374
think the progressive's are doing right 
now because that's the most subjective 

875
00:40:13,931 --> 00:40:15,820
one of any of those terms.
Right?

876
00:40:15,970 --> 00:40:16,391
Well,
I,

877
00:40:16,391 --> 00:40:19,540
I have the wisecrack that progressives 
hate progress.

878
00:40:20,620 --> 00:40:22,930
If you look at the people who denied 
that we've made progress,

879
00:40:22,990 --> 00:40:23,823
it's often the people who politically 
labeled themselves as progressive who 

880
00:40:27,191 --> 00:40:29,890
can't stand the idea that we've made 
progress because they wanted to save it.

881
00:40:29,891 --> 00:40:32,620
Every aspect of our current society and 
institutions.

882
00:40:32,650 --> 00:40:35,530
There's corrupt and racist and 
controlled by the,

883
00:40:35,560 --> 00:40:39,010
by the one percent and everything is 
getting worse and worse and worse.

884
00:40:39,170 --> 00:40:40,003
And ironically,
because the whole point of being a 

885
00:40:41,051 --> 00:40:41,884
progressive presumably is that 
progressive activism is not a waste of 

886
00:40:45,611 --> 00:40:46,444
time,
but it actually brings benefits and 

887
00:40:48,310 --> 00:40:49,143
which,
which actually has it sort of the catch 

888
00:40:50,981 --> 00:40:51,814
22 of,
of progress in general that you have to 

889
00:40:55,360 --> 00:40:57,370
acknowledge it,
but in a weird way,

890
00:40:57,371 --> 00:40:59,770
you need to not acknowledge it to keep 
furthering it.

891
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:00,753
Yeah.
So there is an optimum amount and what 

892
00:41:01,960 --> 00:41:05,320
it has to keep in mind the two ideas 
that we've made progress.

893
00:41:05,321 --> 00:41:07,540
But we've got huge challenges ahead of 
us.

894
00:41:07,900 --> 00:41:12,040
Just a very simple example,
a extreme poverty,

895
00:41:12,130 --> 00:41:15,100
the bare minimum that you,
that you need to feed your family,

896
00:41:15,400 --> 00:41:16,180
uh,
has been,

897
00:41:16,180 --> 00:41:18,220
has been falling.
And that's it.

898
00:41:18,340 --> 00:41:21,550
It's got to be an example of progress in
a couple of hundred years ago,

899
00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:22,593
you could say that probably 90 percent 
of humanity was living in extreme 

900
00:41:25,361 --> 00:41:27,190
poverty.
Now it's less than 10 percent.

901
00:41:27,580 --> 00:41:28,580
That's amazing.
Yeah.

902
00:41:28,600 --> 00:41:30,910
A lot of that happened just in the last 
30 years.

903
00:41:31,220 --> 00:41:34,130
Um,
but another way of stating the same fact

904
00:41:34,190 --> 00:41:38,540
is that 730 million people live in 
extreme poverty.

905
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:43,040
Now that's the same fact,
10 percent of seven point 3 billion,

906
00:41:43,100 --> 00:41:45,830
730 million,
that's an awful lot of miserable people.

907
00:41:46,250 --> 00:41:47,083
Now those are the same described in two 
different ways and we got to be able to 

908
00:41:50,061 --> 00:41:53,450
think in both ways and let's,
let's try to get it to zero now.

909
00:41:53,450 --> 00:41:54,283
That's not a crazy romantic utopian 
story eyed a goal that is one of the UN 

910
00:41:59,871 --> 00:42:02,600
sustainable development goals.
The predecessor,

911
00:42:02,601 --> 00:42:03,434
the Millennium Development Goals for 
poverty was reached five years ahead of 

912
00:42:05,871 --> 00:42:08,180
schedule.
So the new goal,

913
00:42:08,300 --> 00:42:11,780
which is to eliminate extreme poverty 
everywhere by 20,

914
00:42:11,781 --> 00:42:14,810
30,
probably a little too optimistic,

915
00:42:14,990 --> 00:42:16,050
but uh,
but not,

916
00:42:16,051 --> 00:42:16,884
not completely crazy,
and maybe it'll be instead of zero 

917
00:42:19,521 --> 00:42:20,354
percent,
maybe it will be two percent and maybe 

918
00:42:21,501 --> 00:42:22,550
it'll be 20,
40,

919
00:42:22,940 --> 00:42:24,380
but still it's an amazing,
uh,

920
00:42:24,420 --> 00:42:27,560
aspiration in the first place.
How much of this do you think,

921
00:42:27,570 --> 00:42:29,750
and it's a little bit,
gets back to the blank slate,

922
00:42:29,751 --> 00:42:32,600
but how much of this do you think the 
way you view progress,

923
00:42:32,810 --> 00:42:33,643
whether the acknowledgement of progress 
or that you sort of need to feel that 

924
00:42:37,341 --> 00:42:39,470
we've made no progress to kind of fuel 
yourself?

925
00:42:39,680 --> 00:42:40,513
How much of that do you think is just 
hardwired in the way we look at the 

926
00:42:43,521 --> 00:42:44,354
world?

927
00:42:44,390 --> 00:42:48,050
I think some of it comes from a certain 
cognitive biases.

928
00:42:48,230 --> 00:42:49,063
One of them being the availability 
heuristic being discovered by Daniel 

929
00:42:53,060 --> 00:42:53,893
Kahneman and Amos Tversky,
namely the human mind generally 

930
00:42:55,671 --> 00:42:59,900
estimates,
probability and risk by calling examples

931
00:42:59,901 --> 00:43:02,180
from memory.
If you've just seen a,

932
00:43:02,181 --> 00:43:03,014
a tornado on the news,
then you think that tornadoes are a 

933
00:43:04,791 --> 00:43:07,670
major cause of death and the fact that 
you know,

934
00:43:08,020 --> 00:43:11,450
falls off ladders,
killed many more people than tornadoes.

935
00:43:11,690 --> 00:43:13,880
It doesn't register because those don't 
make the news.

936
00:43:14,220 --> 00:43:15,053
Uh,
and,

937
00:43:15,150 --> 00:43:15,983
and we,
we don't naturally calibrate for how 

938
00:43:19,281 --> 00:43:21,650
many opportunities there are for bad 
things to happen,

939
00:43:21,680 --> 00:43:23,600
how big the world is,
how many people there are,

940
00:43:23,690 --> 00:43:26,990
we just remember the examples and that's
what drives our intuitions.

941
00:43:27,230 --> 00:43:29,540
And when you have the news media 
reporting,

942
00:43:29,541 --> 00:43:30,374
everything that goes wrong everywhere,
then you can come away with an 

943
00:43:32,930 --> 00:43:36,590
impression that the world is falling 
apart because all the parts of the world

944
00:43:36,591 --> 00:43:38,510
that aren't falling apart just never 
make the news.

945
00:43:38,560 --> 00:43:40,550
So that's one.
There is also a,

946
00:43:40,551 --> 00:43:41,270
uh,
we,

947
00:43:41,270 --> 00:43:42,103
we are,
I think tuned to dwell on the negative 

948
00:43:45,470 --> 00:43:46,303
probably because bad things can hurt you
a lot more than good things can help 

949
00:43:50,631 --> 00:43:51,464
you.
So there is something adaptive in a 

950
00:43:52,251 --> 00:43:54,780
natural environment to be on the lookout
for,

951
00:43:54,800 --> 00:43:57,290
for what can kill you.
So that's just a survival instinct.

952
00:43:57,291 --> 00:43:57,950
That's,
I think,

953
00:43:57,950 --> 00:44:00,440
part of the survival instinct there.
There are other things too,

954
00:44:00,441 --> 00:44:01,380
like the,
uh,

955
00:44:01,580 --> 00:44:06,320
there's always implicit competition 
between different elites in society,

956
00:44:06,620 --> 00:44:08,870
the academics,
the journalists,

957
00:44:08,900 --> 00:44:11,270
the politicians,
the business people that religious,

958
00:44:11,271 --> 00:44:12,360
the military,
you know,

959
00:44:12,361 --> 00:44:13,194
they're all different kinds of power 
centers and they all kind of compete 

960
00:44:15,861 --> 00:44:19,430
with each other for prestige and a,
and an influence.

961
00:44:19,700 --> 00:44:23,900
And if you say society is declining,
it's corrupt,

962
00:44:23,901 --> 00:44:25,160
it's a mess.
It's horrible.

963
00:44:25,300 --> 00:44:26,570
It's kind of a way of,
uh,

964
00:44:26,690 --> 00:44:30,170
each one of these groups can kind of 
feel superior to the others.

965
00:44:30,440 --> 00:44:31,273
The academics could say,
look what the businessmen in the 

966
00:44:33,121 --> 00:44:34,440
country,
in a business when you can say,

967
00:44:34,441 --> 00:44:36,270
look what the politicians are doing to 
the country.

968
00:44:36,480 --> 00:44:38,640
And the challenges can say,
look,

969
00:44:38,710 --> 00:44:39,543
the incumbents are doing.
And so it's kind of a backhanded way of 

970
00:44:42,660 --> 00:44:43,493
social oneupmanship do you sense that 
right now we're at a unique position to 

971
00:44:48,841 --> 00:44:49,674
bring back more enlightenment values?
Like it seems to me that because of 

972
00:44:53,040 --> 00:44:54,600
trump,
because of social media,

973
00:44:54,601 --> 00:44:57,330
that just everything is sort of upside 
down right now.

974
00:44:57,390 --> 00:44:58,223
This again has been a theme with a bunch
of my guests that everything is sort of 

975
00:45:00,751 --> 00:45:03,780
on the table and that there's great 
opportunity.

976
00:45:03,930 --> 00:45:04,890
We don't know which way it's going to 
go,

977
00:45:04,891 --> 00:45:06,630
but there's great opportunity for good 
ideas.

978
00:45:06,631 --> 00:45:08,820
There's a great opportunity for bad 
ideas.

979
00:45:08,821 --> 00:45:09,654
Obviously.
I know which way we're both hoping this 

980
00:45:10,741 --> 00:45:11,574
is going to be.
Yes.

981
00:45:11,580 --> 00:45:14,130
But do you think that we actually are in
a unique moment right now?

982
00:45:14,131 --> 00:45:16,410
I know everyone always thinks that 
they're always going to be there.

983
00:45:16,411 --> 00:45:18,000
They're always in the moment.
Right?

984
00:45:18,330 --> 00:45:19,980
But do you think there's something 
unique right now?

985
00:45:20,550 --> 00:45:21,110
Well,
it's,

986
00:45:21,110 --> 00:45:21,943
there's someone thinking that there's 
kind of any quality of every reason 

987
00:45:26,460 --> 00:45:30,060
maybe growing that at the top.
There's so many areas in which we become

988
00:45:30,061 --> 00:45:32,790
so much more rational and reasonable,
uh,

989
00:45:32,940 --> 00:45:37,940
like evidence based medicine used to be 
your doctor had a hunch and operated on,

990
00:45:38,041 --> 00:45:38,874
you gave her your drug and there's no 
reason to think that we're actually 

991
00:45:40,711 --> 00:45:41,544
working.
Now therapies are evaluated in a big 

992
00:45:44,251 --> 00:45:45,084
studies or a data driven policing.
One of the reasons that the crime rate 

993
00:45:48,331 --> 00:45:49,164
went down so dramatically starting in 
the nineties is that the police started 

994
00:45:52,141 --> 00:45:55,530
to gather block by block data and where 
the violence was occurring,

995
00:45:55,770 --> 00:45:58,160
they kind of collapsed on those areas 
like a ton of bricks.

996
00:45:58,180 --> 00:45:59,200
Make sure that,
uh,

997
00:45:59,510 --> 00:46:02,420
one gang member that just suffered a,
a,

998
00:46:02,430 --> 00:46:03,263
uh,
an injury wouldn't be roaring for 

999
00:46:04,651 --> 00:46:05,700
revenge saying,
you know,

1000
00:46:05,701 --> 00:46:10,701
we were watching you and that really 
drove down the rate of crime by a lot in

1001
00:46:11,910 --> 00:46:15,480
sports.
I'm a sabermetrics moneyball,

1002
00:46:15,540 --> 00:46:18,480
much more rational analysis.
Uh,

1003
00:46:18,610 --> 00:46:20,850
you know,
there's the effective altruism movement.

1004
00:46:20,910 --> 00:46:25,530
How can we allocate charity and 
volunteering so it actually does good as

1005
00:46:25,531 --> 00:46:27,300
opposed to just giving people a warm 
glow.

1006
00:46:27,740 --> 00:46:30,240
And so all of these areas,
but at the same time,

1007
00:46:30,270 --> 00:46:31,103
you get these not all conspiracy 
theories and the fake news and be a 

1008
00:46:35,820 --> 00:46:40,820
politicized denial of science such as 
vaccine safety and climate change.

1009
00:46:42,090 --> 00:46:42,923
So the question is,
how do we let the standards of 

1010
00:46:44,971 --> 00:46:47,720
rationality,
hitches will trickle down,

1011
00:46:48,480 --> 00:46:50,120
make it so that,
uh,

1012
00:46:50,540 --> 00:46:51,373
that it's kind of second nature for 
everyone to just not think in certain 

1013
00:46:55,501 --> 00:46:58,770
ways because they had just been proven 
to be obviously ridiculous.

1014
00:46:58,830 --> 00:47:00,030
Yeah.
How do you do it?

1015
00:47:00,031 --> 00:47:01,680
I mean,
I think that's a good.

1016
00:47:01,770 --> 00:47:03,450
So I may not be the one to,
uh,

1017
00:47:03,451 --> 00:47:03,880
you know,
to,

1018
00:47:03,880 --> 00:47:04,713
to change a whole society.
I do it by appealing to the kind of 

1019
00:47:07,561 --> 00:47:08,394
people who watch the show,
kind of people would read my books in 

1020
00:47:09,991 --> 00:47:12,690
the hopes that it will kind of spread 
out from there.

1021
00:47:12,900 --> 00:47:13,950
And we know it's not.
No,

1022
00:47:14,020 --> 00:47:14,853
it's not that it can't happen there.
There are certain bad ideas that at one 

1023
00:47:18,841 --> 00:47:22,290
point are taken seriously and then they 
just drop off.

1024
00:47:22,320 --> 00:47:24,450
And like,
no one talks about when ever,

1025
00:47:24,451 --> 00:47:27,750
again,
in my lifetime when I was a kid,

1026
00:47:28,020 --> 00:47:29,770
there was a debate over racial 
segregation,

1027
00:47:30,040 --> 00:47:30,580
you know,
should,

1028
00:47:30,580 --> 00:47:34,270
should,
should black students be admitted to the

1029
00:47:34,270 --> 00:47:34,900
University of Mississippi.
I mean,

1030
00:47:34,900 --> 00:47:36,910
you just couldn't have that debate 
anymore.

1031
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:39,850
Even among the,
the farthest right of the right.

1032
00:47:40,650 --> 00:47:42,900
That's just no longer an issue should 
women be allowed to,

1033
00:47:42,970 --> 00:47:43,570
to,
to,

1034
00:47:43,570 --> 00:47:44,403
to work.

1035
00:47:44,600 --> 00:47:46,270
Um,
and uh,

1036
00:47:46,660 --> 00:47:47,493
in earlier decades and centuries it was 
slavery or women's suffrage and 

1037
00:47:51,941 --> 00:47:53,800
superstitions like,
uh,

1038
00:47:53,801 --> 00:47:57,310
you know,
alchemy a or a human sacrifice.

1039
00:47:57,550 --> 00:47:58,383
So it's not hopeless that sometimes what
happens is that at any given time 

1040
00:48:02,020 --> 00:48:05,500
there's a range of reasonableness,
but that,

1041
00:48:05,510 --> 00:48:06,343
that center drifts.
So that some things that were at the 

1042
00:48:09,281 --> 00:48:10,350
tail end of,
of,

1043
00:48:10,510 --> 00:48:11,343
of ridiculousness,
even the conspiracy theory mongers and 

1044
00:48:16,331 --> 00:48:18,670
the most benighted can no longer take it
seriously.

1045
00:48:18,750 --> 00:48:19,990
Yeah.
How would you,

1046
00:48:19,991 --> 00:48:20,824
this is just sort of are.
Or the discussion around all this is 

1047
00:48:23,200 --> 00:48:25,750
just about our lack of patience.
Because actually when the,

1048
00:48:25,780 --> 00:48:28,510
when the publisher sent me the book,
I said Enlightenment now.

1049
00:48:28,511 --> 00:48:29,344
And as you think you guys had the.
And now he's bigger than enlightenment 

1050
00:48:32,021 --> 00:48:35,620
and I thought that was kind of 
interesting because we live in a time of

1051
00:48:35,621 --> 00:48:36,454
immediate reaction to everything and 
selfies and likes and people just don't 

1052
00:48:41,321 --> 00:48:42,040
have patience anymore.

1053
00:48:42,040 --> 00:48:42,873
Attention spans are,
are incredibly short that we want more 

1054
00:48:47,681 --> 00:48:48,514
now.
But some of these things are just the 

1055
00:48:50,171 --> 00:48:51,350
long game.
Yeah,

1056
00:48:51,610 --> 00:48:53,290
I think that's it.
That's exactly right.

1057
00:48:53,530 --> 00:48:54,363
We also,
we have Amnesia for how things were not 

1058
00:48:57,581 --> 00:48:58,960
so long ago.
Yeah,

1059
00:48:58,961 --> 00:49:01,480
that's a point that I make a uh,
repeatedly,

1060
00:49:01,690 --> 00:49:03,250
even though there are,
you know,

1061
00:49:03,360 --> 00:49:06,070
there's a horrific war going on now in 
Syria,

1062
00:49:06,071 --> 00:49:08,500
but we forget some of the horrific wars 
that were going on in the,

1063
00:49:08,501 --> 00:49:10,540
uh,
in the eighties and nineties.

1064
00:49:11,380 --> 00:49:12,213
What can we do to stop that Amnesia?
Because I think that's a big part of 

1065
00:49:14,531 --> 00:49:15,430
this.
Yeah.

1066
00:49:15,431 --> 00:49:17,770
And I think the culture of journalism 
should,

1067
00:49:17,920 --> 00:49:21,130
should put events of the day into some 
context.

1068
00:49:21,220 --> 00:49:22,960
I don't mean going back hundreds of 
years,

1069
00:49:23,020 --> 00:49:24,850
the American revolution,
but even just,

1070
00:49:24,870 --> 00:49:25,703
you know,
what was like in the 19 nineties was 

1071
00:49:26,721 --> 00:49:29,230
likely the eighties,
the likewise we'll be economy.

1072
00:49:29,230 --> 00:49:33,940
People are so nostalgic for the early 
areas with strong unions and predictable

1073
00:49:33,941 --> 00:49:36,220
wages and factory jobs,
but you know,

1074
00:49:36,221 --> 00:49:39,940
that was also the era of a double digit 
inflation.

1075
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:42,520
Eighteen percent inflation.
If you could pay the rent this year,

1076
00:49:42,521 --> 00:49:43,354
you didn't know whether you could pay it
next year because rick could go up and 

1077
00:49:46,080 --> 00:49:46,913
kind of forget about those days long.
A lines around the block that had 

1078
00:49:49,990 --> 00:49:50,823
gasoline for fear that we'd run out of 
heating oil and fuel freeze in the 

1079
00:49:54,160 --> 00:49:54,993
winter.
A huge high rates of poverty among the 

1080
00:49:58,721 --> 00:49:59,554
elderly.
People that have been has been brought 

1081
00:50:00,521 --> 00:50:03,460
down by social security,
so our just.

1082
00:50:03,461 --> 00:50:07,030
Our commentary should look back.
They're not ancient history,

1083
00:50:07,031 --> 00:50:08,650
but recent history.
Yeah.

1084
00:50:09,910 --> 00:50:12,430
What are some of the other things that 
are that are hopeful right now?

1085
00:50:12,431 --> 00:50:16,210
Are there other markers in society or in
science or politics?

1086
00:50:16,211 --> 00:50:17,044
Are there any other trends that you're 
seeing right now that you think are 

1087
00:50:19,061 --> 00:50:21,520
leading us to some positive places?

1088
00:50:21,760 --> 00:50:22,593
Well,
often you get pleasant surprises when 

1089
00:50:24,491 --> 00:50:26,680
you actually look at trends instead of 
headlines,

1090
00:50:27,140 --> 00:50:29,950
and you and I were talking off camera 
about a,

1091
00:50:30,020 --> 00:50:30,853
a,
a recent survey that showed that 

1092
00:50:31,781 --> 00:50:32,614
contrary to the fears of a millennial 
generation being intolerant of free 

1093
00:50:37,041 --> 00:50:39,830
speech and the rep for that matter,
the society as a whole,

1094
00:50:39,890 --> 00:50:42,620
and especially university campuses,
they actually,

1095
00:50:43,310 --> 00:50:45,920
according to this new study anyway,
you actually plot the data.

1096
00:50:45,980 --> 00:50:50,980
We asked people should people who are 
espousing controversial beliefs at least

1097
00:50:51,171 --> 00:50:53,900
be able to say them.
It's actually been going up.

1098
00:50:54,310 --> 00:50:55,143
Uh,
it's higher among the college educated 

1099
00:50:57,021 --> 00:50:57,854
than the less college educated.
It spans a range of controversial 

1100
00:51:00,831 --> 00:51:01,664
positions.
It's true for millennials as well as 

1101
00:51:03,651 --> 00:51:05,630
baby boomers.
And so the,

1102
00:51:06,080 --> 00:51:06,913
what I,
myself even experienced as a kind of 

1103
00:51:09,650 --> 00:51:14,420
dread and foreboding about a whole 
generation being intolerant of competing

1104
00:51:14,421 --> 00:51:16,400
views,
it turns out to be probably overblown.

1105
00:51:16,650 --> 00:51:19,610
There are a lot of examples like that 
and the other positive developments,

1106
00:51:19,790 --> 00:51:20,191
I mean,
the,

1107
00:51:20,191 --> 00:51:23,090
the high school students protesting are 
ridiculous,

1108
00:51:23,091 --> 00:51:23,924
gun safety laws,
that kind of something that we couldn't 

1109
00:51:27,471 --> 00:51:28,350
have predicted.
Uh,

1110
00:51:28,440 --> 00:51:29,273
so recently the,
the me too movement has had a lot of 

1111
00:51:31,430 --> 00:51:34,550
excesses and you know,
I think there's much to criticize.

1112
00:51:34,780 --> 00:51:35,613
On the other hand,
it's not okay for women to be preyed 

1113
00:51:37,431 --> 00:51:38,264
upon by their bosses and that is 
suddenly becoming an issue and probably 

1114
00:51:41,601 --> 00:51:44,540
the society will on the whole change for
the better because of it.

1115
00:51:44,780 --> 00:51:47,150
I wasn't planning on going here,
but since you mentioned it,

1116
00:51:47,420 --> 00:51:52,420
what would be a humanistic,
enlightened way of looking at guns right

1117
00:51:54,171 --> 00:51:55,430
now?
Oh yeah.

1118
00:51:55,820 --> 00:51:56,870
Well,
some of it a lot.

1119
00:51:57,050 --> 00:51:57,883
It has to start with,
with good data because a lot of our 

1120
00:52:00,920 --> 00:52:02,590
stereotypes of,
uh,

1121
00:52:02,990 --> 00:52:03,620
just,
you know,

1122
00:52:03,620 --> 00:52:05,750
maybe right,
maybe wrong on the right,

1123
00:52:05,751 --> 00:52:06,584
they believe you have concealed carry 
laws then that will reduce crime on the 

1124
00:52:09,681 --> 00:52:10,070
left.

1125
00:52:10,070 --> 00:52:14,870
There is if we control guns,
that will reduce a homicide.

1126
00:52:15,170 --> 00:52:19,400
So we've got to be humble and try to get
as many studies as possible to know what

1127
00:52:19,401 --> 00:52:20,900
will really make a difference in what 
won't.

1128
00:52:21,320 --> 00:52:23,090
But in general,
the idea that,

1129
00:52:23,210 --> 00:52:25,220
uh,
that we're,

1130
00:52:25,221 --> 00:52:28,790
we're better off if we're,
we individually are not the,

1131
00:52:28,791 --> 00:52:30,110
uh,
you're kind of judged,

1132
00:52:30,130 --> 00:52:32,570
jury,
jury and executioner,

1133
00:52:33,470 --> 00:52:34,303
that one of the great advances of 
civilization was that you outsource 

1134
00:52:37,521 --> 00:52:41,660
justice to a disinterested third party 
named with the court system.

1135
00:52:42,650 --> 00:52:43,483
And that the idea that safety comes from
individuals defending their interests 

1136
00:52:46,701 --> 00:52:50,390
with guns is,
will in fact almost certainly has led to

1137
00:52:50,450 --> 00:52:53,970
high rates of violence.
Do you fear though that we could,

1138
00:52:54,160 --> 00:52:57,170
that we often give too much power to the
state?

1139
00:52:57,790 --> 00:52:58,800
I mean,
I think in,

1140
00:52:58,930 --> 00:53:00,650
in,
in some areas we do,

1141
00:53:00,890 --> 00:53:04,160
but I think the idea that people should 
have guns so that they should resist the

1142
00:53:04,161 --> 00:53:04,994
uh,
uh,

1143
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:05,990
the government,
you know,

1144
00:53:05,991 --> 00:53:10,991
the kind of David Koresh and Idaho a 
cults,

1145
00:53:13,430 --> 00:53:15,020
that is a terrible idea.

1146
00:53:15,080 --> 00:53:16,720
The idea that we should resist the 
government with,

1147
00:53:16,721 --> 00:53:17,900
with guns.
I mean,

1148
00:53:17,901 --> 00:53:20,810
that's what they do in Congo,
Somalia,

1149
00:53:21,350 --> 00:53:22,183
we have this thing called democracy.
So if the government becomes too 

1150
00:53:24,501 --> 00:53:26,340
repressive,
we speak out against it.

1151
00:53:26,341 --> 00:53:28,140
We vote,
we petition,

1152
00:53:28,400 --> 00:53:29,970
I,
we form organizations.

1153
00:53:30,110 --> 00:53:32,070
But the idea that we're going to shoot 
back at the police,

1154
00:53:32,100 --> 00:53:33,150
I mean,
that's nuts.

1155
00:53:33,630 --> 00:53:36,120
What do you think of the state of our 
democracy in general?

1156
00:53:36,150 --> 00:53:39,870
Because I think we're breaking off into 
these different factions now where,

1157
00:53:40,280 --> 00:53:41,113
I mean,
I think some people genuinely think 

1158
00:53:42,420 --> 00:53:43,201
that,
you know,

1159
00:53:43,201 --> 00:53:44,034
this hashtag resistance,
that we're under this horrific 

1160
00:53:46,111 --> 00:53:46,944
authoritarian regime with.
We don't even have to get into trump 

1161
00:53:49,360 --> 00:53:50,193
specifically if you don't want,
but what do you think of just sort of 

1162
00:53:52,130 --> 00:53:52,963
the,
the,

1163
00:53:53,160 --> 00:53:55,800
the systems that are in place,
the branches of government,

1164
00:53:55,801 --> 00:53:56,634
all of the documents that founded this 
or are they doing all right at the 

1165
00:53:59,341 --> 00:54:00,174
moment?

1166
00:54:00,820 --> 00:54:02,880
So,
so there are a lot of,

1167
00:54:03,330 --> 00:54:07,170
uh,
by any standards of world history,

1168
00:54:07,171 --> 00:54:11,250
we live in fantastic freedom.
Know I could say that,

1169
00:54:11,251 --> 00:54:11,880
uh,
you know,

1170
00:54:11,880 --> 00:54:15,390
trump is a moron and he's a fascist and 
I don't have to worry about being put in

1171
00:54:15,391 --> 00:54:16,141
jail.
I mean,

1172
00:54:16,141 --> 00:54:17,670
that's a real.
Something to take,

1173
00:54:18,020 --> 00:54:20,730
not to take for granted.
If I sent the equivalent in Turkey,

1174
00:54:20,850 --> 00:54:22,700
I wouldn't be put in jail or in,
in,

1175
00:54:22,701 --> 00:54:26,160
in Venezuela.
Is that a little bit of the short memory

1176
00:54:26,161 --> 00:54:28,230
on some of these things and why you need
to know history?

1177
00:54:28,231 --> 00:54:31,580
Because I think that all the time I see 
these guys all over twitter medians.

1178
00:54:31,590 --> 00:54:32,670
It's amazing.
Yeah.

1179
00:54:32,680 --> 00:54:36,390
You can say what ever you really can and
we should not take that for granted.

1180
00:54:36,391 --> 00:54:37,224
It's apartment history,
but also partly a comparisons across 

1181
00:54:40,201 --> 00:54:43,590
countries.
And then history remembering fascism and

1182
00:54:43,591 --> 00:54:46,080
communism and looking at regions today 
like,

1183
00:54:46,100 --> 00:54:48,060
like Turkey and Venezuela and Russia.

1184
00:54:48,510 --> 00:54:50,190
There's that.
It,

1185
00:54:50,530 --> 00:54:51,363
the,
what's not so healthy is like 

1186
00:54:54,210 --> 00:54:58,260
gerrymandering that obviously super a 
subversion of democracy,

1187
00:54:58,680 --> 00:54:59,513
uh,
the effects of lobbying and campaign 

1188
00:55:02,040 --> 00:55:03,510
contributions from the,
the,

1189
00:55:03,511 --> 00:55:05,640
the wealthiest.
That can't be a good idea.

1190
00:55:06,060 --> 00:55:10,440
The fact that our elections drag on for 
a year and depends so much on,

1191
00:55:10,470 --> 00:55:13,550
on a cash is a problem.
Um,

1192
00:55:13,551 --> 00:55:17,310
and there are government bureaucracies 
that have gotten too big and too,

1193
00:55:17,360 --> 00:55:21,060
too many regulations that don't actually
do anything beneficial.

1194
00:55:21,480 --> 00:55:26,480
I don't think that means that's called 
for just reducing regulation with,

1195
00:55:26,681 --> 00:55:27,031
uh,
with,

1196
00:55:27,031 --> 00:55:27,864
uh,
a meat cleaver because some regulations 

1197
00:55:29,470 --> 00:55:30,960
really have done,
done good.

1198
00:55:30,961 --> 00:55:33,450
We've got cleaner air,
we've got less poverty.

1199
00:55:33,550 --> 00:55:34,383
Uh,
but we should at least analyze what 

1200
00:55:36,871 --> 00:55:38,630
government programs,
uh,

1201
00:55:38,660 --> 00:55:39,493
are,
are cost effective and which ones are 

1202
00:55:40,471 --> 00:55:42,930
just a nuisance and a drag.
Yeah.

1203
00:55:42,931 --> 00:55:47,060
And even having that conversation then 
gets people crazy where I,

1204
00:55:47,061 --> 00:55:47,894
I personally,
I come from it from a little more of a 

1205
00:55:49,141 --> 00:55:49,974
libertarian perspective and I would 
usually say that these days we've got 

1206
00:55:52,381 --> 00:55:53,214
people like Elon Musk that can get us to
Mars and that can help clean the 

1207
00:55:56,641 --> 00:55:57,474
environment and green energy and all of 
those things where I know there's just 

1208
00:55:59,671 --> 00:56:01,020
another set of people that think,
well,

1209
00:56:01,021 --> 00:56:03,450
we just can't leave it to the 
industrialists.

1210
00:56:03,450 --> 00:56:04,283
We have to leave it to the government.
That's at least a place where we can 

1211
00:56:06,900 --> 00:56:09,030
have some respectful disagreement that's
a,

1212
00:56:09,090 --> 00:56:09,923
that's a great place to.
That's the conversation we should be 

1213
00:56:11,101 --> 00:56:11,840
having.
And I,

1214
00:56:11,840 --> 00:56:12,200
uh,
my,

1215
00:56:12,200 --> 00:56:13,033
my view is that there has to be a mix of
a policy and regulation and a private 

1216
00:56:19,141 --> 00:56:22,740
enterprise I and with all of the 
creativity and,

1217
00:56:23,410 --> 00:56:24,243
and bottom up a diversity that.
So an example would be one thing that 

1218
00:56:27,821 --> 00:56:31,720
the government can do and that private 
industry can do is put a price on carbon

1219
00:56:31,721 --> 00:56:34,780
emissions and this is a,
a position that both left wing and right

1220
00:56:34,781 --> 00:56:37,330
wing economists favor.
But having done that,

1221
00:56:37,360 --> 00:56:38,193
then the private sector can come up with
a technology to reduce CO2 and it 

1222
00:56:42,070 --> 00:56:43,600
shouldn't be up to the government to say
this,

1223
00:56:43,680 --> 00:56:45,850
this company is the one that we're going
to have support.

1224
00:56:45,920 --> 00:56:47,500
Right?
And that's where the,

1225
00:56:47,560 --> 00:56:47,981
the,
uh,

1226
00:56:47,981 --> 00:56:48,814
the,
the free market really does a better 

1227
00:56:49,481 --> 00:56:50,830
job.
But having that,

1228
00:56:50,890 --> 00:56:51,723
that discussion,
and I think Libertarians deserve credit 

1229
00:56:55,091 --> 00:56:59,350
for raising an issue that people on the 
left just don't even think of.

1230
00:56:59,351 --> 00:57:00,184
Like just because you have good 
intentions and you have a program with 

1231
00:57:02,501 --> 00:57:05,350
the goal of achieving some good doesn't 
mean it's gonna work.

1232
00:57:05,830 --> 00:57:06,663
Total waste of money.
Well that's what I think so much of it 

1233
00:57:08,321 --> 00:57:09,760
is.
It sounds good.

1234
00:57:09,761 --> 00:57:10,594
It all sounds good.
We want the government to do all these 

1235
00:57:13,091 --> 00:57:15,970
things and then we know that in practice
often,

1236
00:57:15,971 --> 00:57:16,804
although you've laid out a case for some
of these things that actually do work 

1237
00:57:18,611 --> 00:57:19,770
cleaner air here,
I mean look,

1238
00:57:19,810 --> 00:57:21,730
we're in Los Angeles and air is cleaner 
and it really,

1239
00:57:21,731 --> 00:57:23,440
it had a lot to do with the government 
for sure.

1240
00:57:23,560 --> 00:57:24,393
So I absolutely acknowledge that,
but to me it seems like so much of it 

1241
00:57:26,981 --> 00:57:28,090
feels like it's.

1242
00:57:28,110 --> 00:57:28,943
It sounds good.
Let's just sort of hand it to the 

1243
00:57:30,941 --> 00:57:31,631
government.
Yeah.

1244
00:57:31,631 --> 00:57:32,464
And then you end up creating a whole 
series of other problems that are from 

1245
00:57:35,741 --> 00:57:38,200
fiscal things to,
to all sorts of other things.

1246
00:57:38,320 --> 00:57:40,090
Yeah,
and I agree and I think actually in some

1247
00:57:40,091 --> 00:57:44,110
ways liberals had been their own worst 
enemy and not being willing to have that

1248
00:57:44,111 --> 00:57:46,540
conversation and almost like the 
platform is,

1249
00:57:46,810 --> 00:57:47,643
if you support government programs,
you're a good person and if you post 

1250
00:57:49,511 --> 00:57:50,470
them,
you're a bad person.

1251
00:57:50,830 --> 00:57:51,730
Whereas the,
the,

1252
00:57:51,890 --> 00:57:55,690
the discussion really should be which 
government programs make us better off,

1253
00:57:55,720 --> 00:57:58,330
repay their costs to clean up the air,
reduce poverty,

1254
00:57:58,450 --> 00:57:59,500
which ones are,
you know,

1255
00:57:59,501 --> 00:58:00,334
boondoggles are bureaucracies and that 
way even the people who are liberals 

1256
00:58:04,301 --> 00:58:06,970
could at least have some ammunition and 
say,

1257
00:58:06,971 --> 00:58:07,511
well,
don't,

1258
00:58:07,511 --> 00:58:09,550
don't kill that program.
It actually works.

1259
00:58:10,140 --> 00:58:10,973
And I have in the book a graph of the 
environmental quality since the EPA was 

1260
00:58:18,220 --> 00:58:20,220
initiated in 1970 by Richard Nixon.

1261
00:58:20,220 --> 00:58:21,053
As it turns out,
and the population has increased by 40 

1262
00:58:23,051 --> 00:58:26,910
percent GDP increased by two and a half.
Uh,

1263
00:58:27,130 --> 00:58:31,180
we've driven twice as many miles,
but air pollution has been reduced by 60

1264
00:58:31,181 --> 00:58:32,530
percent.
So,

1265
00:58:32,531 --> 00:58:34,900
and that,
that almost certainly wouldn't have just

1266
00:58:34,901 --> 00:58:37,360
happened with market innovation because 
there's just no,

1267
00:58:37,390 --> 00:58:40,150
no one individually has an incentive to 
not pollute.

1268
00:58:40,480 --> 00:58:43,360
That's the kind of thing where 
governments can make a difference.

1269
00:58:43,600 --> 00:58:44,433
Likewise,
I'm a poverty or there are certain 

1270
00:58:47,441 --> 00:58:49,540
measures like the earned income tax 
credit,

1271
00:58:49,600 --> 00:58:50,433
which is a kind of negative income tax 
where almost everyone who a right and 

1272
00:58:54,701 --> 00:58:55,534
left two exams.
So that's a government program that 

1273
00:58:56,711 --> 00:58:58,030
really worked.
It's kind of cheap.

1274
00:58:58,330 --> 00:58:59,163
So automatic and it really did reduce 
poverty and the lower middle class and 

1275
00:59:03,250 --> 00:59:07,510
working poor and we need to have that 
discussion so that the liberals for that

1276
00:59:07,511 --> 00:59:08,470
matter can say,
well,

1277
00:59:08,500 --> 00:59:09,520
this,
this program works.

1278
00:59:09,520 --> 00:59:11,050
Don't cut it.
They don't pay.

1279
00:59:11,140 --> 00:59:11,973
But even they have kind of disarmed on 
the often on the evidentiary a debate 

1280
00:59:17,470 --> 00:59:19,690
and just made it more realistic.
Yeah.

1281
00:59:19,691 --> 00:59:23,360
I think that's what so many of us that I
would include in this new group.

1282
00:59:23,361 --> 00:59:25,260
Have you heard this phrase,
intellectual dark web?

1283
00:59:25,261 --> 00:59:27,380
Has this,
has this come across your desk?

1284
00:59:27,390 --> 00:59:29,310
I googled it.
I mean,

1285
00:59:30,150 --> 00:59:32,240
do you sort of catch what I mean?
I think that,

1286
00:59:32,450 --> 00:59:35,390
I don't know who's to say what it is or 
who is in it or whatever,

1287
00:59:35,391 --> 00:59:38,180
but it strikes me that you were sort of 
one of the people that's right there.

1288
00:59:38,230 --> 00:59:39,063
Just people that are all coming together
because we're just trying to get a 

1289
00:59:42,471 --> 00:59:45,260
little bit of the answers here,
which really is what this is about.

1290
00:59:45,470 --> 00:59:46,280
Yeah.
And um,

1291
00:59:46,280 --> 00:59:48,860
the way Jonathan Haidt calls it,
his viewpoint diversity,

1292
00:59:49,710 --> 00:59:50,543
that it's,
uh,

1293
00:59:50,800 --> 00:59:51,633
it's not pushing a particular ideology,
but it's getting a set of ideas out 

1294
00:59:55,671 --> 00:59:56,900
there that,
that they have to,

1295
00:59:57,040 --> 00:59:58,040
they have,
they have to struggle.

1296
00:59:58,040 --> 00:59:59,520
They don't,
they don't get a pass.

1297
00:59:59,521 --> 01:00:02,030
The whole point of,
of mentioning them is that,

1298
01:00:02,120 --> 01:00:03,380
okay,
now now attack them,

1299
01:00:03,381 --> 01:00:08,280
see if they survive.
Is there a piece of America right now or

1300
01:00:08,380 --> 01:00:10,220
I guess we can say this in the West in 
general,

1301
01:00:10,221 --> 01:00:13,130
that our freedoms have gotten so good 
actually,

1302
01:00:13,131 --> 01:00:15,980
that we can't really figure out what's 
bad.

1303
01:00:15,981 --> 01:00:18,050
So for example,
like during the,

1304
01:00:18,310 --> 01:00:19,143
uh,
the whole debate over the football 

1305
01:00:20,361 --> 01:00:21,194
players kneeling for the anthem,
I was watching people and everyone's 

1306
01:00:23,541 --> 01:00:26,240
just screaming about everything.
And half the people hate trump.

1307
01:00:26,241 --> 01:00:27,074
Half the people say the football players
are anti American and half the people 

1308
01:00:29,241 --> 01:00:30,074
turn it on the owners of the teams.
But I tried to lay out a case that 

1309
01:00:33,650 --> 01:00:38,650
actually the entire thing worked the way
it was supposed to do in a free society.

1310
01:00:38,781 --> 01:00:41,450
Trump said something,
but he didn't.

1311
01:00:41,600 --> 01:00:44,330
Whether you agree with what he said or 
not about mocking the players,

1312
01:00:44,450 --> 01:00:45,283
he didn't try to pass a law about it,
so he has so he exercises his free 

1313
01:00:48,051 --> 01:00:48,350
speech.

1314
01:00:48,350 --> 01:00:51,380
It's important to recognize that that he
has that right to.

1315
01:00:51,530 --> 01:00:53,150
If he had tried to pass a law,
that's a different thing.

1316
01:00:53,151 --> 01:00:55,970
The players could either neil or not 
neil,

1317
01:00:55,971 --> 01:00:58,700
they might have to deal with the 
repercussions of that.

1318
01:00:58,701 --> 01:01:02,000
The owners could decide whether they 
want it to keep those players on.

1319
01:01:02,001 --> 01:01:04,610
Their teams are not.
The fans could decide if they want it to

1320
01:01:04,611 --> 01:01:06,710
not buy jerseys or not or not attend 
games.

1321
01:01:06,711 --> 01:01:10,580
Right.
That to me it was actually like a puzzle

1322
01:01:10,760 --> 01:01:11,593
of freedom actually working and yet 
every day for months people were 

1323
01:01:15,351 --> 01:01:16,490
screaming that this is,
you know,

1324
01:01:16,491 --> 01:01:20,300
that this is tyrannical regime and 
everything so horrible.

1325
01:01:20,410 --> 01:01:21,243
Does that sort of jive with you that,
that we've gotten to a place where we 

1326
01:01:23,481 --> 01:01:24,314
don't.
Our freedoms are so great that we're 

1327
01:01:25,851 --> 01:01:26,684
making these,
these mountains out of things that are 

1328
01:01:28,760 --> 01:01:30,890
important to talk about,
but yeah,

1329
01:01:30,920 --> 01:01:31,753
I think that's a good.

1330
01:01:31,990 --> 01:01:33,150
That's good analysis.
I mean,

1331
01:01:33,151 --> 01:01:38,030
I think it's a way of appreciating what 
other countries would would die for.

1332
01:01:38,060 --> 01:01:38,893
I mean,
you just couldn't have that football 

1333
01:01:40,101 --> 01:01:43,300
players or soccer players and the here 
in Turkey protests,

1334
01:01:43,310 --> 01:01:44,390
government policy.
I mean they,

1335
01:01:44,410 --> 01:01:45,890
they'd be in jail.
Turkey,

1336
01:01:45,891 --> 01:01:46,780
one of our ally,
you know,

1337
01:01:46,850 --> 01:01:47,683
ally,
it depends how you want to use air 

1338
01:01:49,911 --> 01:01:50,640
quotes.
Yeah.

1339
01:01:50,640 --> 01:01:52,340
But yes,
I guess I think sort of a good point.

1340
01:01:52,390 --> 01:01:53,223
Yeah.
Yeah.

1341
01:01:53,300 --> 01:01:54,580
So before we finish up here,
give me it.

1342
01:01:54,590 --> 01:01:55,423
Give me a few more things to just feel 
hopeful about because I think that 

1343
01:01:57,830 --> 01:01:58,663
really is what you're,
you're trying to show people that 

1344
01:02:00,711 --> 01:02:03,800
there's so much goodness right now and 
let's not lose that.

1345
01:02:04,010 --> 01:02:04,311
Yeah.
Well,

1346
01:02:04,311 --> 01:02:05,121
here's some,
some,

1347
01:02:05,121 --> 01:02:06,210
uh,
heartening facts.

1348
01:02:06,211 --> 01:02:07,044
They have the flynn effect that Iq 
scores have been rising by three points 

1349
01:02:10,401 --> 01:02:13,390
a decade for almost a century.
A something here.

1350
01:02:13,800 --> 01:02:17,210
I know.
Incredible as it may sound really well.

1351
01:02:17,360 --> 01:02:18,830
I'm going to have to dive into that one 
a little bit.

1352
01:02:18,831 --> 01:02:21,480
I spent much time on twitter.
Uh,

1353
01:02:22,430 --> 01:02:24,900
certainly the fact that extreme poverty 
has been plummeting,

1354
01:02:24,901 --> 01:02:27,030
I think is one of the greatest things 
that's ever happened to me,

1355
01:02:27,090 --> 01:02:27,923
literally from 75 percent reduction just
in 30 years in global rate of extreme 

1356
01:02:32,011 --> 01:02:34,530
poverty and the rise of,
of literacy,

1357
01:02:34,740 --> 01:02:35,573
90 percent of the world's population 
under the age of 25 can read and write 

1358
01:02:38,880 --> 01:02:42,900
and there's almost perfect parody now 
between girls and boys,

1359
01:02:42,930 --> 01:02:46,770
but that's encouraging diseases.
Infectious diseases are in decline.

1360
01:02:46,860 --> 01:02:47,850
Um,
malaria,

1361
01:02:47,880 --> 01:02:49,410
tuberculosis,
diarrhea,

1362
01:02:49,680 --> 01:02:50,513
and uh,
we vanquish smallpox just sent it off 

1363
01:02:53,761 --> 01:02:54,580
into the,
the,

1364
01:02:54,580 --> 01:02:55,413
the,
uh,

1365
01:02:55,440 --> 01:02:57,300
in,
into ancient history.

1366
01:02:57,390 --> 01:03:01,110
It's no longer a disease there.
We may do the same thing with polio with

1367
01:03:01,230 --> 01:03:04,200
Guinea worm is terrific progress being 
made.

1368
01:03:04,650 --> 01:03:06,960
Um,
the uh,

1369
01:03:07,310 --> 01:03:10,230
and values of toleration.

1370
01:03:10,260 --> 01:03:11,290
And,
um,

1371
01:03:11,700 --> 01:03:12,533
what would I think we'd all agree,
or progressive values such as a 

1372
01:03:16,320 --> 01:03:18,930
toleration of homosexuality,
of women's equality,

1373
01:03:18,990 --> 01:03:22,650
have the right to get a divorce of 
political participation.

1374
01:03:22,680 --> 01:03:23,850
Uh,
those have,

1375
01:03:23,880 --> 01:03:24,713
believe it or not,
all been in Ge in a gradual increase in 

1376
01:03:27,661 --> 01:03:28,494
every part of the world,
even in the most politically backward 

1377
01:03:31,831 --> 01:03:32,820
part of the world.
Namely,

1378
01:03:32,821 --> 01:03:36,330
the Middle East and North Africa,
there's been an increase with,

1379
01:03:36,390 --> 01:03:37,223
especially when you compare generations 
with the younger generations are much 

1380
01:03:40,501 --> 01:03:41,360
more,
uh,

1381
01:03:41,700 --> 01:03:42,533
open and uh,
I'm sympathetic to liberal values than 

1382
01:03:46,320 --> 01:03:48,740
the older generation and there's a,
a,

1383
01:03:48,760 --> 01:03:50,280
a,
a widespread illusion.

1384
01:03:50,400 --> 01:03:54,480
Everyone thinks that everyone else is 
more reactionary than they really are.

1385
01:03:54,570 --> 01:03:55,470
Uh,
people say,

1386
01:03:55,471 --> 01:03:56,640
well,
I'm kind of progressive,

1387
01:03:56,641 --> 01:03:57,474
but everyone around me reactionaries 
there's a huge gap in how tolerant 

1388
01:04:02,611 --> 01:04:06,540
people really are and in how tolerant 
they think everyone else's.

1389
01:04:06,680 --> 01:04:08,760
And that's really interesting.
All right,

1390
01:04:08,761 --> 01:04:09,900
so,
so in summation,

1391
01:04:09,920 --> 01:04:12,870
we should feel good about the future,
but we have to fight for it,

1392
01:04:12,871 --> 01:04:15,210
right?
We should be recognized.

1393
01:04:15,211 --> 01:04:16,044
What we're in danger of losing.
We should recognize what we've 

1394
01:04:17,401 --> 01:04:22,401
accomplished as a kind of a impetus to 
do more steven pinker,

1395
01:04:23,940 --> 01:04:26,090
it's been an absolute pleasure.
Thank you for doing remind.

1396
01:04:26,130 --> 01:04:27,810
Thanks for having me.
And for more on Steven,

1397

check out his new book enlightenment.
Now the case for reasons science,

1398
01:04:31,291 --> 01:04:34,830
humanism and progress,
which we've linked to write down below.
