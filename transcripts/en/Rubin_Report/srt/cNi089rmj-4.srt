1
00:00:04,470 --> 00:00:08,220
Joining me today as a student and 
activist and the director of high school

2
00:00:08,221 --> 00:00:10,990
outreach for turning point USA,
Kyle [inaudible].

3
00:00:11,010 --> 00:00:13,080
You have welcome to the Rubin report.
Thanks for having me on.

4
00:00:13,350 --> 00:00:16,050
I'm excited to have you here.
We've met a couple times.

5
00:00:16,051 --> 00:00:21,051
We've done some events together.
You are seemingly wise beyond your 

6
00:00:21,330 --> 00:00:23,610
years.
That's true.

7
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:25,260
All right,
let's get to it.

8
00:00:25,261 --> 00:00:27,030
Well actually,
I mean in a weird way,

9
00:00:27,031 --> 00:00:32,031
I guess you've been,
you've been sort of thrust into being 

10
00:00:32,031 --> 00:00:35,301
wise beyond your years.
You were obviously a survivor of the 

11
00:00:35,301 --> 00:00:35,301
parkland shooting.
Uh,

12
00:00:35,301 --> 00:00:37,370
as you know,
I had your classmate calmer and Kasey,

13
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:39,180
I'm a couple of weeks ago and he kind of
laid out,

14
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:44,680
uh,
what happened to him that day and 

15
00:00:44,680 --> 00:00:44,680
subsequently everything that's happened.
So let's just start there because that's

16
00:00:44,680 --> 00:00:45,960
kind of what put you on the map.

17
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:47,720
Okay.
I'll sort of preface it.

18
00:00:48,510 --> 00:00:53,510
I don't like it.
I don't like to refer myself as a 

19
00:00:53,510 --> 00:00:55,451
survivor because I wasn't in the 
building that was shot into and I think 

20
00:00:55,451 --> 00:00:57,320
that cheapens the pain and tragedy that 
people who were in the building.

21
00:00:57,650 --> 00:00:59,240
Uh,
so what happened with me that day,

22
00:01:00,260 --> 00:01:01,910
it was fourth period.
Uh,

23
00:01:01,911 --> 00:01:06,911
I was in,
I was in my fourth period Class A and 

24
00:01:06,911 --> 00:01:10,301
all of a sudden the alarms a ring.
So we go into the hallway and we're 

25
00:01:10,301 --> 00:01:12,110
walking out and we hear two,
like two little pops.

26
00:01:12,380 --> 00:01:14,990
I don't know if two textbooks fell.
No fire,

27
00:01:15,020 --> 00:01:16,850
fire works.
I really had no idea.

28
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:18,670
So we run back,
uh,

29
00:01:18,671 --> 00:01:22,040
and I go and reach for,
for the,

30
00:01:22,041 --> 00:01:25,820
uh,
the door to my classroom and the teacher

31
00:01:25,821 --> 00:01:27,350
locked it.
So you go into a nearby room,

32
00:01:27,351 --> 00:01:29,960
we get in there and we just hide for two
hours straight.

33
00:01:29,961 --> 00:01:32,550
We just hear pops and ambulances.
I ended up.

34
00:01:32,790 --> 00:01:36,650
So that was the freshman building and 
the entire time we had no idea was going

35
00:01:36,651 --> 00:01:37,680
on.
Uh,

36
00:01:37,710 --> 00:01:40,340
and then all throughout the entire time 
people,

37
00:01:40,550 --> 00:01:43,100
uh,
immediately or just villainizing guns,

38
00:01:43,150 --> 00:01:48,150
you know,
the second we got a second I got out of 

39
00:01:48,150 --> 00:01:48,150
the,
uh,

40
00:01:48,150 --> 00:01:48,290
the closet that I was in,
kids were like,

41
00:01:48,291 --> 00:01:49,510
we have to be an air fifteens

42
00:01:49,730 --> 00:01:54,730
yeah,
let's not jump into the political 

43
00:01:54,730 --> 00:01:54,730
parties.
So it's like,

44
00:01:54,730 --> 00:01:54,930
because it's interesting just listening 
to you hear about that.

45
00:01:54,931 --> 00:01:59,931
It's almost like the way you were 
describing it almost sounds like you 

46
00:01:59,931 --> 00:02:02,661
weren't even there.
Like it's just like a story that you 

47
00:02:02,661 --> 00:02:02,661
were telling in a bizarre way.
So once.

48
00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:04,380
Okay.
So all of this happens,

49
00:02:04,381 --> 00:02:06,330
you find out now they're,
they're dead students.

50
00:02:06,331 --> 00:02:07,800
I mean to do a friend killed.

51
00:02:08,630 --> 00:02:10,820
So we get it.
We get out of the closet,

52
00:02:10,821 --> 00:02:12,350
so takes us out.
They put their,

53
00:02:12,351 --> 00:02:14,350
you know,
air fifteens in our faces,

54
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:19,360
take us out.
We have to put our hands on the person 

55
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:19,550
in front of us walking outside and all 
throughout this,

56
00:02:19,551 --> 00:02:24,551
the most disgusting thing was every 
single corner of the entire block 

57
00:02:24,551 --> 00:02:25,340
surrounding us was just filled with 
media.

58
00:02:25,341 --> 00:02:30,341
Cars was just like jam packed.
And what I saw there was that whenever 

59
00:02:30,651 --> 00:02:33,570
there was like someone crying or like a 
moment of pain,

60
00:02:33,590 --> 00:02:35,780
the media would just surround them and 
encapsulate them.

61
00:02:36,450 --> 00:02:41,450
Uh,
and I got home and I was really hoping 

62
00:02:41,450 --> 00:02:44,621
that this wouldn't be like a politicized
spectacle with like mass media jumping 

63
00:02:45,561 --> 00:02:47,450
the gun to everything.
Uh,

64
00:02:47,870 --> 00:02:50,870
and sadly that was the case.
So when I was sitting there in shock,

65
00:02:50,871 --> 00:02:53,630
seeing the numbers rise on the screens 
for the death count,

66
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:58,840
it was like so insane to internalize 
what had just occurred because like 

67
00:02:58,840 --> 00:02:58,840
everyone's always,
you know,

68
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:01,510
this will never happen to my school.
How could this happen to my school?

69
00:03:01,810 --> 00:03:06,810
Uh,
and the sad reality is it can happen to 

70
00:03:06,810 --> 00:03:06,810
any school.
Like,

71
00:03:06,810 --> 00:03:09,000
I mean,
stoneman Douglas was in the most 

72
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:09,000
affluent,
low crime,

73
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,360
you know,
city I think in southern Florida.

74
00:03:10,870 --> 00:03:12,160
And this happened at our school.

75
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:14,920
Did you know some of the kids that were 
killed?

76
00:03:15,090 --> 00:03:16,230
Yeah,
I knew one girl,

77
00:03:16,290 --> 00:03:18,840
Helena.
She was in a class of my year back.

78
00:03:18,970 --> 00:03:23,970
Yeah.
So what kind of time did you guys have 

79
00:03:23,970 --> 00:03:24,910
to grieve because that you were already 
alluding to this,

80
00:03:25,270 --> 00:03:27,880
but it was like,
it was as if the event happened,

81
00:03:27,881 --> 00:03:30,340
the shooting happened,
and then it seemingly,

82
00:03:30,670 --> 00:03:35,670
there was no grieving.
And then you guys were all over the 

83
00:03:35,670 --> 00:03:35,670
television.
You were all over twitter.

84
00:03:35,670 --> 00:03:39,280
You at all political people using you 
guys and all sorts of different ways.

85
00:03:39,281 --> 00:03:44,281
Just tell me a little bit about just 
kind of the grieving and trying to be 

86
00:03:44,281 --> 00:03:44,281
able to be.
How old are you now?

87
00:03:44,281 --> 00:03:44,950
17.
You're 17.

88
00:03:44,951 --> 00:03:46,450
Trying to be 16,
15,

89
00:03:46,451 --> 00:03:51,451
16,
17 year old kids trying to just survive 

90
00:03:51,451 --> 00:03:51,760
something.
Unimaginably horrible.

91
00:03:52,020 --> 00:03:54,480
Yeah.
I don't know how freshmen and sophomores

92
00:03:54,690 --> 00:03:56,300
have managed to go through this.
Like I'm,

93
00:03:56,370 --> 00:03:58,110
I'm at least a Jew.
I was a junior at the time,

94
00:03:58,470 --> 00:04:03,470
so I,
I knew the school have a better in 

95
00:04:03,470 --> 00:04:03,470
somewhat of my self esteem,
a little more,

96
00:04:03,470 --> 00:04:03,570
build up more and a little bit more 
mature.

97
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:09,080
Uh,
but there was absolutely no time to 

98
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:09,080
grieve whatsoever,
like a few days after the shooting.

99
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:10,460
They already buses up to Tallahassee 
till,

100
00:04:10,461 --> 00:04:15,461
you know,
kind of like push to like tug on the 

101
00:04:15,461 --> 00:04:17,661
emotional heartstrings of Republicans to
pass legislation that the otherwise 

102
00:04:17,661 --> 00:04:18,750
wouldn't have passed.
Who's they in that equation?

103
00:04:18,780 --> 00:04:19,850
So there are some,
uh,

104
00:04:19,980 --> 00:04:21,030
members,
uh,

105
00:04:21,150 --> 00:04:22,790
in the Florida Senate,
uh,

106
00:04:22,830 --> 00:04:26,100
that like personally like coordinated 
buses.

107
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:28,530
I'm from Parkland to Tallahassee.

108
00:04:28,590 --> 00:04:30,900
Yeah.
And what were your parents saying or the

109
00:04:30,901 --> 00:04:31,950
friends,
you know,

110
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:32,700
friends,
parents.

111
00:04:32,701 --> 00:04:37,701
Like,
it just seemed like the parents were 

112
00:04:37,701 --> 00:04:39,360
almost gone now,
now there is some of the parents that 

113
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:39,360
are a little more high profile that I,
that I see,

114
00:04:39,420 --> 00:04:41,370
but it was as if you guys were just like
taken.

115
00:04:41,371 --> 00:04:46,371
That's what it felt like suddenly we're 
seeing on CNN and town halls and I want 

116
00:04:46,371 --> 00:04:49,701
to talk a little bit about that,
but just like that you were just used 

117
00:04:49,701 --> 00:04:51,750
all over the place with not even having 
a moment to just digest what happened.

118
00:04:52,110 --> 00:04:57,110
So,
so here's how I don't think that 

119
00:04:57,110 --> 00:04:57,110
necessarily.
So,

120
00:04:57,110 --> 00:04:59,250
so here's what I think will happen.
I think that the kids saw what happened.

121
00:04:59,430 --> 00:05:01,890
They were shocked as they should be and 
they decided tack,

122
00:05:02,130 --> 00:05:07,130
like we said,
this can't happen to anyone else ever 

123
00:05:07,130 --> 00:05:07,130
again.
Let's do something.

124
00:05:07,130 --> 00:05:11,870
You know what,
what really occurred is that the 

125
00:05:11,870 --> 00:05:11,870
mainstream media jumped,
jumped on this immediately,

126
00:05:11,870 --> 00:05:16,870
uh,
and just like put it to like a national 

127
00:05:16,870 --> 00:05:17,610
scale and really used it to push a gun 
control agenda.

128
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:22,760
And that's why I started speaking out 
because I wanted to represent the other 

129
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:23,580
side of stone douglas who doesn't 
believe in gun control.

130
00:05:23,700 --> 00:05:28,700
Yeah.
So just tell me a little bit about you 

131
00:05:28,700 --> 00:05:28,700
in high school before this.
Like we've jumped a lot.

132
00:05:28,700 --> 00:05:28,970
Yeah,
yeah,

133
00:05:28,971 --> 00:05:29,340
yeah,
yeah.

134
00:05:29,410 --> 00:05:30,000
What,
what,

135
00:05:30,030 --> 00:05:32,040
what was kyle?
Because you have like before this,

136
00:05:32,041 --> 00:05:37,041
because I know you sort of as a 
political beast now and like a wickedly 

137
00:05:37,041 --> 00:05:37,770
incisive twitter and like,
you know,

138
00:05:37,771 --> 00:05:39,570
you've put on events that I've been part
of and I,

139
00:05:39,571 --> 00:05:44,571
and you're incredibly organized and 
connecting with great people and all 

140
00:05:44,571 --> 00:05:45,090
that stuff which is telling you about 
the kid.

141
00:05:45,091 --> 00:05:45,630
Before that,

142
00:05:45,850 --> 00:05:49,000
I'll give you all the recap.
Give me the story of my life story.

143
00:05:49,001 --> 00:05:49,870
Let's go.
Yeah.

144
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:51,650
So,
uh,

145
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:55,870
so my parents came from Israel.
They immigrated here.

146
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:57,680
My Dad,
my mom served in the IDF.

147
00:05:58,280 --> 00:06:01,280
They came here,
there's nothing worked their way up.

148
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,220
And then when I was,
when I was at home they taught me Hebrew

149
00:06:04,490 --> 00:06:09,490
and English.
So we only spoke Hebrew at home so I'm 

150
00:06:09,490 --> 00:06:10,730
fluent Hebrew and they put me through 
school and I was always the shortest kid

151
00:06:10,731 --> 00:06:15,731
in the grade.
So I was like always like I was just 

152
00:06:15,731 --> 00:06:17,801
like,
even shorter than the shortest girl in 

153
00:06:17,801 --> 00:06:17,801
my grade.
I was like super short and like,

154
00:06:17,801 --> 00:06:18,560
what was it like in like eighth grade?
I was four foot eight,

155
00:06:18,561 --> 00:06:22,870
I was like legally it in eighth grade.
So I'll,

156
00:06:22,980 --> 00:06:27,980
I got bullied a lot.
Like I try not to have a victim hood 

157
00:06:27,980 --> 00:06:27,980
mentality because I don't think it's 
successful and I think you agree with me

158
00:06:27,980 --> 00:06:28,280
on that.

159
00:06:28,610 --> 00:06:33,610
Um,
so it was always bullied and I was 

160
00:06:33,610 --> 00:06:37,091
always,
I was always smart so that Kinda went 

161
00:06:37,091 --> 00:06:40,211
back on me a little bit,
but I was always put a lot and it built 

162
00:06:40,211 --> 00:06:42,410
up my self esteem.
In addition,

163
00:06:42,411 --> 00:06:44,840
I was always like taking the hardest 
classes.

164
00:06:44,841 --> 00:06:47,660
My parents would always push me to take 
the hardest classes possible.

165
00:06:47,910 --> 00:06:49,940
Um,
so at Douglas,

166
00:06:49,941 --> 00:06:51,410
before all this,
uh,

167
00:06:51,450 --> 00:06:53,300
you know,
as someone who I had a good social life,

168
00:06:53,630 --> 00:06:55,160
uh,
so I would basically,

169
00:06:55,161 --> 00:06:57,140
I would go to school,
do my ap classes,

170
00:06:57,141 --> 00:06:58,130
go home,
play video games,

171
00:06:58,131 --> 00:06:59,600
so like 10,
10:00

172
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:02,150
PM,
start homework to like start homework,

173
00:07:02,151 --> 00:07:03,470
you know,
and then finish it at 2:00

174
00:07:03,470 --> 00:07:05,120
AM and then have like five hours of 
sleep.

175
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:10,360
So that was my cycle was terrible.
But I was super addicted to video games 

176
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:13,700
and then the shooting happens and just 
turned my entire life upside down.

177
00:07:13,910 --> 00:07:16,820
So it just completely changed me.
So at that moment,

178
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:18,830
you know,
I had to become much more mature.

179
00:07:19,250 --> 00:07:21,110
I had,
I was living in the adult world,

180
00:07:21,340 --> 00:07:22,430
you know,
I had responsibilities.

181
00:07:22,431 --> 00:07:23,740
There are things that had to do,
you know,

182
00:07:23,790 --> 00:07:28,070
I had to act a proper certain way and 
you know,

183
00:07:28,390 --> 00:07:28,780
uh,

184
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:34,440
did you have any particular political 
beliefs before all this because you're 

185
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:38,161
definitely in terms of at least the kids
or the young people that are public 

186
00:07:38,161 --> 00:07:39,190
about all of this now that have come out
of snowmen.

187
00:07:39,191 --> 00:07:40,210
Douglas.
I mean,

188
00:07:40,211 --> 00:07:42,820
you definitely are the one that seemed,
at least that I know of is,

189
00:07:42,850 --> 00:07:46,890
is the furthest right that is sort of 
embraced conservatism and all that did.

190
00:07:47,050 --> 00:07:48,730
Is that where you were politically to 
hear that?

191
00:07:48,740 --> 00:07:53,740
They not about me.
My parents aren't political at all 

192
00:07:53,740 --> 00:07:58,360
whatsoever.
So all my political beliefs I have 

193
00:07:58,360 --> 00:08:00,431
developed myself and how I develop every
single political belief is just I look 

194
00:08:00,431 --> 00:08:04,811
at it straight from a rational,
logical point of view with no emotions 

195
00:08:04,811 --> 00:08:07,811
whatsoever.
I think you can guess I'm not an 

196
00:08:07,811 --> 00:08:07,811
emotional person,
so like I think with,

197
00:08:07,811 --> 00:08:12,190
with legislative decisions,
you have to put a motion as far out of 

198
00:08:12,190 --> 00:08:12,260
it as possible.
You have to do policies that,

199
00:08:12,530 --> 00:08:15,320
that actually solve the problem,
not just make you feel good.

200
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:18,200
So I'm really not a,
not for feel good policies.

201
00:08:18,950 --> 00:08:21,400
You care about politics at all before 
any of this or is this new?

202
00:08:21,750 --> 00:08:22,610
Yeah,
I didn't care either.

203
00:08:22,620 --> 00:08:27,620
The 2016 election I was,
I was somewhat into it after the 

204
00:08:27,620 --> 00:08:30,021
election I kind of didn't care as much,
but I was always somewhat of a second 

205
00:08:30,021 --> 00:08:30,610
amendment supporter.
Um,

206
00:08:31,710 --> 00:08:32,640
yeah,
but when I,

207
00:08:32,641 --> 00:08:34,890
when I started speaking out,
so it's really interesting.

208
00:08:34,891 --> 00:08:39,891
When I started speaking out a,
it was like a tidal wave of opposition,

209
00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:41,520
you know,
I had,

210
00:08:41,521 --> 00:08:43,710
my school was against me.
Someone seemed like that,

211
00:08:43,950 --> 00:08:48,950
you know,
all my peers were against me and I try 

212
00:08:48,950 --> 00:08:51,501
not to do a victim mentality.
I just want to paint the picture of how 

213
00:08:51,501 --> 00:08:51,501
it actually was.
And it seemed like the community,

214
00:08:51,501 --> 00:08:52,670
the mainstream media and my friends,
you know,

215
00:08:52,770 --> 00:08:54,810
it seemed like I was going against every
single opposition,

216
00:08:55,530 --> 00:08:56,850
you know,
I was scared like this could,

217
00:08:57,030 --> 00:08:59,250
this could have ruined my life,
but,

218
00:08:59,251 --> 00:09:04,251
you know,
I believed in what I was doing and I 

219
00:09:04,251 --> 00:09:04,251
just power through it.

220
00:09:04,251 --> 00:09:04,350
Uh,
and,

221
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:09,400
and just really,
I just stuck to my beliefs and didn't 

222
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:09,400
let anyone tell me otherwise because,
you know,

223
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:11,040
when I was.
So when I was in Tallahassee,

224
00:09:11,740 --> 00:09:16,740
uh,
when they were pushing Republican 

225
00:09:16,740 --> 00:09:16,740
legislators to enact gun control 
legislation,

226
00:09:16,740 --> 00:09:16,980
I said,
look,

227
00:09:18,330 --> 00:09:20,310
gun control isn't going to solve the 
problem.

228
00:09:20,820 --> 00:09:22,980
I want to solve the problem.
Okay,

229
00:09:22,981 --> 00:09:25,740
I want to make sure that school school 
shootings never happened.

230
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:28,740
What can I do to actually make that 
happen?

231
00:09:29,430 --> 00:09:31,680
And what can I do while protecting the 
second amendment?

232
00:09:31,681 --> 00:09:34,530
Because I actually believe it's one of 
those fundamental rights of Americans.

233
00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:38,460
So while I was there,
I started speaking out and nobody cared,

234
00:09:38,570 --> 00:09:43,570
like APP.
I would go to reporters and nobody 

235
00:09:43,570 --> 00:09:43,570
cared.
So I had to forcefully know,

236
00:09:43,610 --> 00:09:44,670
like talk to reporters,
say,

237
00:09:44,671 --> 00:09:45,720
hey look,
I'm a conservative.

238
00:09:45,930 --> 00:09:50,930
Can I reach out?
And then I managed to get a Leland 

239
00:09:50,930 --> 00:09:51,710
Vitor,
a contact with Louis that are at Fox and

240
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:56,720
I want them Fox and I did an interview 
and then Ben Shapiro psy and it blew 

241
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:56,720
off.
But all the wild.

242
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:56,720
Yes.

243
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:57,460
That's the first time I remember seeing.

244
00:09:57,500 --> 00:10:02,500
Yeah.
And all the while there's this extreme 

245
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:02,500
opposition and the entire thing that 
I've,

246
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:03,130
I've always had.
Sorry.

247
00:10:03,430 --> 00:10:04,900
Well I just wanted to.
What do you,

248
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:10,000
because I know you,
you kind of mock the media the way I do 

249
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,721
now on,
on twitter and just sort of what 

250
00:10:12,721 --> 00:10:14,491
mainstream media has become and that 
they really activists and journalists 

251
00:10:14,491 --> 00:10:14,680
and that whole thing.
Um,

252
00:10:14,890 --> 00:10:17,560
but were you shocked when you were going
up to them and going,

253
00:10:17,890 --> 00:10:22,890
you know,
I'm a conservative or I want to defend 

254
00:10:22,890 --> 00:10:24,811
the second amendment,
but I'm a student from this school and 

255
00:10:24,811 --> 00:10:24,940
they're just blatantly ignoring you.
Or even.

256
00:10:24,941 --> 00:10:29,941
I know this is minor,
but like I remember when a bunch of you 

257
00:10:29,941 --> 00:10:32,761
guys were all verified on twitter.
It was with instagram as well.

258
00:10:33,341 --> 00:10:35,650
It took me like three months after 
everyone else.

259
00:10:35,790 --> 00:10:36,750
Yeah.
And I'm not saying that,

260
00:10:36,751 --> 00:10:39,730
that it doesn't really mean it doesn't 
matter in and of itself,

261
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:44,760
but it is,
it is a symptom of sort of the broader 

262
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:45,460
situation going on here with tech 
companies and media and all that.

263
00:10:45,461 --> 00:10:48,610
Like were they flat out ignoring you?
You saw them interviewing people.

264
00:10:48,611 --> 00:10:50,620
And then.
So here's here,

265
00:10:51,010 --> 00:10:51,880
here's what occurred,

266
00:10:52,550 --> 00:10:55,210
uh,
the main organizers of that,

267
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:58,060
that you can recruit a solid group of,
like the march for our live kids.

268
00:10:58,420 --> 00:11:03,420
At this point they had solidified a 
click and they wouldn't let anyone new 

269
00:11:03,420 --> 00:11:04,390
or with a different opposing view into 
it.

270
00:11:04,391 --> 00:11:06,130
So I said I had to take matters into my 
own hand.

271
00:11:06,370 --> 00:11:07,900
In addition,
we were in Tallahassee.

272
00:11:07,901 --> 00:11:12,901
I realized that the mainstream media is 
just doing this for clicks because can 

273
00:11:12,901 --> 00:11:15,640
we think about it when shooting occurs?
And the mainstream media loves it.

274
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:18,940
Like they get great coverage,
they get great amount of views,

275
00:11:18,970 --> 00:11:20,240
they do.
Um,

276
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:25,360
I'll switch,
I'll talk to like notoriety in addition 

277
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:25,360
after this.
But I saw that when someone,

278
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:29,320
there was a girl crying and Tallahassee 
and the second she cried just,

279
00:11:29,321 --> 00:11:34,321
she got sworn by reporters.
And I saw that they were just looking 

280
00:11:34,321 --> 00:11:37,590
for clicks and for headlines and I 
realize that they're really,

281
00:11:37,990 --> 00:11:42,990
they're not reading it for the right 
reasons and they're not gonna listen to 

282
00:11:42,990 --> 00:11:43,690
a rational or irrational young kid like 
me.

283
00:11:44,140 --> 00:11:46,090
Okay.
So in addition,

284
00:11:46,091 --> 00:11:48,790
I also realized that there was an 
extreme amount of just.

285
00:11:48,791 --> 00:11:51,010
People were just getting benefiting off 
of this so much.

286
00:11:51,300 --> 00:11:56,300
I'm so the shooting when you realized 
that a lot of this occurred because the 

287
00:11:56,951 --> 00:11:57,440
shooter,
who I,

288
00:11:57,460 --> 00:12:00,780
I try not to say his name ever because I
think that gives them to notarize them.

289
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:02,240
They,
they,

290
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:03,940
they would,
they would post.

291
00:12:04,090 --> 00:12:09,090
So here's what time did.
So the video of the shooter were 

292
00:12:09,090 --> 00:12:09,090
basically says,
you know,

293
00:12:09,090 --> 00:12:10,480
I'm going to be the next school shooter 
of Twenty Eighteen,

294
00:12:10,700 --> 00:12:14,080
I want 20 people.
And he basically says,

295
00:12:14,081 --> 00:12:16,150
you're all going to see me on the news.
So.

296
00:12:16,270 --> 00:12:19,860
And then Time magazine puts this video 
up on Youtube.

297
00:12:19,861 --> 00:12:24,861
It gets three point 6 million views.
The same thing with all the other 

298
00:12:24,861 --> 00:12:24,861
videos.
You know,

299
00:12:24,861 --> 00:12:27,040
CNN talked about this exact clip and 
basically just still showed it on air.

300
00:12:27,090 --> 00:12:32,090
Yeah.
So the entire thing with the mainstream 

301
00:12:32,090 --> 00:12:32,090
media is doing is that they're 
basically,

302
00:12:32,090 --> 00:12:36,360
they're just benefiting off the 
situation and what they don't realize 

303
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:36,610
that they're perpetuating the issue and 
making it worse.

304
00:12:36,611 --> 00:12:41,611
That's why I think daily wire of Ben is 
doing a great decision with not showing 

305
00:12:41,611 --> 00:12:41,890
their names and faces because it's an 
ethical decision.

306
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:47,280
No,
I don't think government should impose 

307
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:47,280
on,
on,

308
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:48,580
on the mainstream media to not allow the
show their faces.

309
00:12:48,581 --> 00:12:53,581
But I think it's an ethical and moral 
decisions that people should be taking 

310
00:12:53,581 --> 00:12:53,581
up.

311
00:12:53,581 --> 00:12:53,581
Yeah.
So just to be totally clear.

312
00:12:53,581 --> 00:12:57,731
So after this shooting,
that was when Ben announced he's the 

313
00:12:57,731 --> 00:13:00,611
editor of wired,
they are no longer going to show their 

314
00:13:00,611 --> 00:13:00,611
name days after.
Yeah.

315
00:13:00,620 --> 00:13:04,310
So okay.
So you started to see this,

316
00:13:04,370 --> 00:13:09,370
this issue with the media that they're 
ignoring people like you and they're 

317
00:13:09,370 --> 00:13:12,761
sort of making other people stars and 
they're going for the clicks and all of 

318
00:13:12,761 --> 00:13:12,761
that.
What about,

319
00:13:12,850 --> 00:13:17,850
you know,
I don't want to make this about people 

320
00:13:17,850 --> 00:13:17,850
per se,
but so that,

321
00:13:17,850 --> 00:13:21,011
that little click of of kids that then 
was all over the media and was getting 

322
00:13:21,011 --> 00:13:22,430
retweeted by every celebrity and all of 
that.

323
00:13:22,850 --> 00:13:26,630
Were you trying to reach out to them at 
all and just have that discussion or was

324
00:13:26,631 --> 00:13:27,470
it just very clear?

325
00:13:27,590 --> 00:13:30,340
Oh No,
I still try to have that discussion.

326
00:13:30,670 --> 00:13:32,530
You know,
when they first started speaking I said,

327
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:33,370
oh my God,
that's great.

328
00:13:33,371 --> 00:13:37,140
Someone speaking out.
And originally when the movement started

329
00:13:37,150 --> 00:13:37,980
speed,
when it started,

330
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,560
you know,
remember Cameron Caskey was on,

331
00:13:39,670 --> 00:13:43,870
on the car shouting the movement wasn't 
an Antiguan movement.

332
00:13:43,871 --> 00:13:46,210
It was an anti school shooting.
And I said,

333
00:13:46,211 --> 00:13:48,160
hey guys,
this is quickly.

334
00:13:48,250 --> 00:13:48,830
I just,
I was like,

335
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:53,880
I gave him the morning guys,
it looks like you're moving through the 

336
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:55,921
direction of an anti gun movement and I 
don't think that's beneficial at all.

337
00:13:56,170 --> 00:13:58,250
So here's my point of view.
I tried communicating and I,

338
00:13:58,350 --> 00:14:01,570
and I tried speaking on and they really 
didn't care in allowing me.

339
00:14:01,571 --> 00:14:02,290
So I said,
okay,

340
00:14:02,350 --> 00:14:04,570
I have to go solo.
And that's what I've been doing,

341
00:14:04,571 --> 00:14:09,571
but I've,
I've always been open to discussion and 

342
00:14:09,571 --> 00:14:12,901
open debate.
I think it was one of the great things 

343
00:14:12,901 --> 00:14:12,901
that we're a country where you can have,
you know,

344
00:14:12,901 --> 00:14:12,901
open discussion,
uh,

345
00:14:12,901 --> 00:14:17,820
and just free expression of ideas.
That's why I think the Kanye thing is 

346
00:14:17,820 --> 00:14:20,821
somewhat great because regardless of 
what you think of the person or 

347
00:14:20,821 --> 00:14:20,821
celebrity,
um,

348
00:14:20,821 --> 00:14:20,821
I'm,
I'm not,

349
00:14:20,821 --> 00:14:25,650
I'm not in favor of propping up 
celebrities and their political opinion 

350
00:14:25,650 --> 00:14:29,491
simply because they're famous.
But you don't need a lot of political 

351
00:14:29,491 --> 00:14:29,580
expertise to say that I believe in free 
expression,

352
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:30,070
free thought,

353
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:30,740
right?
That's,

354
00:14:30,810 --> 00:14:33,800
that shouldn't be a really controversial
position to be,

355
00:14:33,820 --> 00:14:34,600
to be staking out.
Alright.

356
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:37,640
So you mentioned cameron and you know,
I had them on the show a couple of weeks

357
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:42,640
ago.
He's going through a very interesting 

358
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:44,360
evolution right now.
I suspect I can figure out where this is

359
00:14:44,361 --> 00:14:49,361
going to end up,
which actually be much closer to your 

360
00:14:49,361 --> 00:14:50,210
position than the position that he sort 
of at right now.

361
00:14:50,211 --> 00:14:53,330
Because I just continually see that as 
the evolution of things.

362
00:14:53,331 --> 00:14:55,880
The more that he understands rights and 
all of those things,

363
00:14:55,881 --> 00:14:58,880
but I was happy to hear his thoughts and
all that and he sat down with me.

364
00:14:58,881 --> 00:15:01,550
He sat down with Shapiro and I think 
you'll continue to do that.

365
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:06,880
Um,
have you guys been able to make any 

366
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:09,791
piece with some of this stuff or you 
must at least be enjoying the fact that 

367
00:15:09,791 --> 00:15:09,791
somebody kind of coming around?

368
00:15:09,791 --> 00:15:10,170
No,
I think.

369
00:15:10,171 --> 00:15:14,080
I think Cam's a good guy.
I think that what we're seeing right now

370
00:15:14,081 --> 00:15:19,081
is that he's matured.
I mean we've all made so and cam have 

371
00:15:19,081 --> 00:15:22,501
gone through like the same political 
slash media experience so we can 

372
00:15:22,501 --> 00:15:24,100
understand each other.
What happened with came as like,

373
00:15:24,101 --> 00:15:25,120
look,
we've all made mistakes.

374
00:15:25,121 --> 00:15:30,121
We've all said stuff we don't want to,
but he's matured and I've also matured 

375
00:15:30,121 --> 00:15:30,121
a.
and what I see,

376
00:15:30,121 --> 00:15:34,590
what I think is happening with Cam,
it's a natural progression of just 

377
00:15:34,590 --> 00:15:35,710
having logical thought instead of 
emotions.

378
00:15:35,890 --> 00:15:39,580
And I think logic and facts moves you 
towards the political beliefs of being a

379
00:15:39,581 --> 00:15:39,970
conservative.

380
00:15:41,110 --> 00:15:43,630
Okay.
So all of this happens.

381
00:15:43,631 --> 00:15:47,350
I think the,
the sort of rock bottom of this was that

382
00:15:47,351 --> 00:15:49,660
CNN town hall.
That was terrible.

383
00:15:50,430 --> 00:15:51,850
Yeah.
Just share your thoughts on that.

384
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,500
So here's what happened with the CNN 
town hall.

385
00:15:56,340 --> 00:16:01,340
So a lot of the kids that you saw there 
were actually flown in on a private jet 

386
00:16:01,340 --> 00:16:05,600
from Tallahassee.
So already at the time of the town hall 

387
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:07,800
there was a solidified group click of,
of the kids that you see now,

388
00:16:08,050 --> 00:16:13,050
and they won't let anything until they 
actually flew these kids on a private 

389
00:16:13,050 --> 00:16:14,740
jet from Tallahassee to the town hall.
And right there it was,

390
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:15,990
it was just simply,

391
00:16:17,700 --> 00:16:22,700
they were just the,
it was an anti gun debate and they were 

392
00:16:22,700 --> 00:16:25,401
just villainizing Rubio in Dana lasts 
for things that had nothing into their 

393
00:16:25,401 --> 00:16:26,160
control whatsoever.
It wasn't their fault.

394
00:16:26,161 --> 00:16:31,161
And Marco Rubio was villainized to such 
an extreme extent and he's one of the 

395
00:16:31,161 --> 00:16:32,510
best senators.
Uh,

396
00:16:32,670 --> 00:16:35,010
so you've now connected with Rubio.
Yeah.

397
00:16:35,670 --> 00:16:36,300
Yeah.
I mean,

398
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:41,400
I hate it because when people say that 
politicians just don't care.

399
00:16:42,270 --> 00:16:43,800
It's just so wrong.
I mean,

400
00:16:43,801 --> 00:16:45,450
politicians,
they do care.

401
00:16:45,790 --> 00:16:46,950
Um,
and you know,

402
00:16:46,951 --> 00:16:51,951
he was one of the greatest supporters of
the school violence act that we got 

403
00:16:51,951 --> 00:16:51,951
passed,
um,

404
00:16:51,951 --> 00:16:54,780
and you just helped push it and look,
these senators don't want this to occur.

405
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:58,770
Kenny was and just saying,
the politicians want this to happen.

406
00:16:58,771 --> 00:16:59,340
It's just wrong.

407
00:17:00,190 --> 00:17:05,190
Do you have any thoughts on what 
actually happened that day in terms of 

408
00:17:05,190 --> 00:17:07,600
security or what should have happened or
should've or shouldn't have happened?

409
00:17:07,840 --> 00:17:10,000
Because even now when you go back and 
listen,

410
00:17:10,001 --> 00:17:11,710
depending on where you're getting your 
news from this,

411
00:17:11,711 --> 00:17:12,400
it sounds,
you know,

412
00:17:12,401 --> 00:17:16,660
they either step down or they didn't go 
in or this or that or the other thing.

413
00:17:16,661 --> 00:17:18,160
And it's like,
well,

414
00:17:18,290 --> 00:17:18,780
well,
what,

415
00:17:18,810 --> 00:17:23,810
what should have happened in the ideal 
world that you want to create in the 

416
00:17:23,810 --> 00:17:24,790
system that you want to create to 
protect this,

417
00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:27,370
these schools from not having this 
happen again?

418
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:28,550
Um,
what,

419
00:17:28,630 --> 00:17:29,740
what should it happen that day?

420
00:17:29,950 --> 00:17:34,950
What we saw at my school was simply an 
utterly just massive and competence and 

421
00:17:35,951 --> 00:17:38,230
failure of law enforcement.
You know,

422
00:17:38,260 --> 00:17:38,710
the,
the.

423
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:42,820
So the shooter was flagged multiple 
times by the school,

424
00:17:43,150 --> 00:17:45,340
by the school administration.
They knew he had mental issues.

425
00:17:45,341 --> 00:17:47,960
He was put into the promise program,
um,

426
00:17:48,790 --> 00:17:52,530
and knew that this kid was a threat.
There were 76 times the police.

427
00:17:52,590 --> 00:17:54,570
There were 76 times the police came to 
his house,

428
00:17:54,571 --> 00:17:55,620
the retreat,
FBI reports,

429
00:17:55,770 --> 00:18:00,770
they knew that this kid was a threat and
the law enforcement was completely 

430
00:18:00,770 --> 00:18:03,900
incompetent at that level and they 
didn't do absolutely anything.

431
00:18:03,930 --> 00:18:08,420
Everyone knew this kid was an issue.
What happened at school was,

432
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:13,020
was just utter incompetence in addition.
So when he gets on campus,

433
00:18:13,830 --> 00:18:16,950
okay,
you just make a straight beeline for the

434
00:18:16,951 --> 00:18:21,951
freshman building and at the exact same 
time we had a school resource officer 

435
00:18:22,310 --> 00:18:22,820
who,
who,

436
00:18:22,821 --> 00:18:27,821
who heard the gunfire and came and he 
just hid in a corner while kids were 

437
00:18:27,821 --> 00:18:27,821
dying.

438
00:18:27,821 --> 00:18:30,780
And then three unarmed individuals 
rushed to save at three.

439
00:18:30,781 --> 00:18:35,781
Oh,
three on our went to the building and 

440
00:18:35,781 --> 00:18:36,120
died trying to save kids.
What we should have had,

441
00:18:36,510 --> 00:18:41,510
and this is why I pushed for it,
the only way to stop a shooter who is 

442
00:18:41,970 --> 00:18:46,230
active on campus is to have other people
who are armed.

443
00:18:46,290 --> 00:18:51,290
The only way to stop,
it's not a cliche that you only way to 

444
00:18:51,290 --> 00:18:51,290
stop a bad guy with a gun is a good guy 
with a gun,

445
00:18:51,290 --> 00:18:56,150
and in addition to that,
there's the entire idea of a gun free 

446
00:18:56,150 --> 00:18:58,080
gun free zone.
It is utterly stupid.

447
00:18:58,660 --> 00:19:01,650
It is just completely stupid.
All it's doing is enticing.

448
00:19:01,670 --> 00:19:02,610
A target saying,
look,

449
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:03,990
you go here,
so here's,

450
00:19:03,991 --> 00:19:08,991
here's what's the school?
The average response time from police 

451
00:19:08,991 --> 00:19:10,200
station to a school nationally is 15 
minutes.

452
00:19:10,470 --> 00:19:12,840
The average time a school shooting 
happens is five minutes.

453
00:19:13,020 --> 00:19:15,570
That means the shooter has 15 minutes to
do whatever he wants.

454
00:19:15,750 --> 00:19:17,910
If the school is a gun free zone,
so here's what I'm saying,

455
00:19:18,630 --> 00:19:22,590
at least allow teachers who have gone to
the proper training,

456
00:19:22,670 --> 00:19:27,670
you know,
ex military ex law enforcement to be 

457
00:19:27,670 --> 00:19:30,831
armed because what that does is it sends
not only a message as a deterrent to a 

458
00:19:30,831 --> 00:19:31,500
shooter that says,
look,

459
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:33,330
this school is armed.
If you get in here,

460
00:19:33,331 --> 00:19:38,331
your brains are going to be blown out.
It also says that that the school is in 

461
00:19:39,821 --> 00:19:44,821
a gun.
Free School is no longer a gun free 

462
00:19:44,821 --> 00:19:44,821
zone.
So I'm,

463
00:19:44,821 --> 00:19:45,270
I'm with you partly on that.
So what I would,

464
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:50,600
maybe maybe you can explain this a 
little bit further so I don't know that 

465
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:52,190
I want guns in those classrooms even if 
it's.

466
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:57,191
So here's the license usage.
I think there are 25 states where 

467
00:19:57,191 --> 00:20:01,161
teachers can be armed or not armed in 
schools and all the hypotheticals that 

468
00:20:01,161 --> 00:20:01,680
are pronounced.

469
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:02,400
It's like,
you know what,

470
00:20:02,401 --> 00:20:06,250
if a teacher shoots a student when 
there's another like,

471
00:20:06,280 --> 00:20:11,280
like what if there's a school shooter 
and a teacher gets shot and there was a 

472
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:11,280
gun on the floor.
What does a student do?

473
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:15,021
It's these hypotheticals don't happen.
20 five states where teachers are 

474
00:20:15,021 --> 00:20:19,280
already armed and it works.
So why not just have them have security 

475
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:21,930
guards at specific?
So here's the thing,

476
00:20:21,931 --> 00:20:26,931
I'm all for having security guards.
This entire issue is how do we best 

477
00:20:26,931 --> 00:20:28,080
manage our funds?
Insecure our schools.

478
00:20:28,230 --> 00:20:33,230
The thing with law enforcement officers 
that they cost a lot of money and 

479
00:20:33,230 --> 00:20:35,090
impoverished schools are ready need that
funding for materials.

480
00:20:35,410 --> 00:20:39,540
And in addition,
it does not take a lot of training and a

481
00:20:39,541 --> 00:20:41,250
lot of money to have a teacher to be 
armed.

482
00:20:41,251 --> 00:20:46,251
And this has already been proven to work
in an initiative when you have teachers 

483
00:20:46,251 --> 00:20:46,950
who are armed,
the shooter doesn't know who it,

484
00:20:47,110 --> 00:20:48,520
if you,
if it's a law enforcement officer,

485
00:20:48,521 --> 00:20:49,750
you can clearly see who it is.

486
00:20:49,750 --> 00:20:52,570
So if you've one resource officer,
school resource officer who's armed,

487
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:55,330
the shooter comes and takes out the 
school resource officer and then they're

488
00:20:55,331 --> 00:20:57,730
free to do whatever,
but it's simply.

489
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:03,000
So here's the thing,
simply giving teachers to have the 

490
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,371
opportunity has a massive effect because
it's up to their own will to do so they 

491
00:21:05,371 --> 00:21:07,180
have to go through training and they 
have to.

492
00:21:07,210 --> 00:21:10,060
It's a concealed carry.
So nobody knows they have them.

493
00:21:11,350 --> 00:21:14,620
So as you said before,
you like facts and logic.

494
00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:15,350
Okay?
Yeah.

495
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:17,920
Strictly facts.
Facts don't care about your feelings.

496
00:21:17,921 --> 00:21:18,670
All right,
I got you.

497
00:21:18,671 --> 00:21:19,520
That,
that,

498
00:21:19,521 --> 00:21:23,110
that works.
When you've engaged some of your friends

499
00:21:23,370 --> 00:21:26,050
and other students about these ideas.
I mean,

500
00:21:26,051 --> 00:21:31,051
everyone watching this at this point 
knows that so much of what's coming out 

501
00:21:31,051 --> 00:21:32,200
of the modern left is about feelings and
all of these things.

502
00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:36,550
Do you have a sense that they understand
that young people,

503
00:21:36,551 --> 00:21:37,980
at least the ones you're talking to 
understand like,

504
00:21:38,110 --> 00:21:40,480
what rights are,
what,

505
00:21:40,481 --> 00:21:43,390
why,
why we should care about these things,

506
00:21:43,391 --> 00:21:48,391
why free speech matters,
why the second amendment matters and 

507
00:21:48,391 --> 00:21:48,391
things of that nature.

508
00:21:48,391 --> 00:21:49,120
So,
or does it all just sound good to them?

509
00:21:49,121 --> 00:21:50,640
And there's a,
that's pretty much it.

510
00:21:50,641 --> 00:21:52,420
It makes them feel good.
You know,

511
00:21:52,570 --> 00:21:54,790
what they push and makes them feel good 
by their emotions.

512
00:21:54,791 --> 00:21:55,930
That makes sense.
So here's the thing,

513
00:21:56,260 --> 00:22:01,260
I am very scared of lowering the age for
people to vote to be 15.

514
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:07,200
Like that scares me because the kids 
that I know who are 15 know absolutely 

515
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:11,941
nothing about politics.
I think I know like the kids from the 

516
00:22:11,941 --> 00:22:15,601
march for our lives better than I think 
I know their own arguments better than 

517
00:22:15,601 --> 00:22:18,571
they know their own arguments.
Like I can argue for them better than 

518
00:22:18,571 --> 00:22:20,110
they can do.
So I strictly use facts only.

519
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:22,060
Um,
so when I make an argument with them,

520
00:22:22,690 --> 00:22:24,190
I cannot really know what they're going 
to do next.

521
00:22:24,191 --> 00:22:26,940
So here's how I'll give you like a 10 
minute or five minute recap.

522
00:22:26,980 --> 00:22:30,700
Basically how I premise the second 
amendment argument in America,

523
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:36,360
we have the right to bear arms in DC 
versus Heller that rule that an 

524
00:22:36,360 --> 00:22:37,450
individual's right to arms.
It doesn't mean the militia,

525
00:22:37,451 --> 00:22:39,190
the militia clause is different from the
individual,

526
00:22:39,191 --> 00:22:44,191
right to bear arms.
That means that you personally have the 

527
00:22:44,191 --> 00:22:44,470
right to arm yourself.
Okay?

528
00:22:44,471 --> 00:22:47,140
There are about 270 million guns in the 
United States.

529
00:22:47,770 --> 00:22:49,930
Fifty dollars million.
Those are air fifteens.

530
00:22:49,990 --> 00:22:53,590
So we look at the guns sets are 33,000
annual gun deaths,

531
00:22:53,860 --> 00:22:56,590
66 percent.
So two thirds are suicides.

532
00:22:56,591 --> 00:22:58,960
So leaves us with 11,000
gun deaths a.

533
00:22:58,961 --> 00:23:01,360
So we have to.
So in addition to put in parentheses,

534
00:23:01,361 --> 00:23:03,190
there's a difference in a homicide and a
murder.

535
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:08,280
So homicide is,
is just a killing murders and unlawful 

536
00:23:08,280 --> 00:23:10,060
killing and gun stats.
A lot of them like to perverse this into

537
00:23:10,120 --> 00:23:15,120
skew statistics.
So three percent of all gun deaths are 

538
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:15,130
with rifles.

539
00:23:15,430 --> 00:23:16,540
Okay?
And in that three percent,

540
00:23:16,541 --> 00:23:21,541
68 percent of those are suicides.
So one percent of all gun that's are 

541
00:23:21,541 --> 00:23:23,320
actual murders are actually.
Sorry.

542
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:25,270
Yeah,
we're actually murders with rifles.

543
00:23:25,550 --> 00:23:30,400
A 80 percent of all gun crime related 
activity is with illegal firearms,

544
00:23:30,620 --> 00:23:34,030
a most schools,
most shootings or with pistols.

545
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:39,240
So.
So march for life was five bullet 

546
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:39,240
points.
One of them is like,

547
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:42,640
I don't like to talk about the CDC and 
we should allow the CDC to research.

548
00:23:42,790 --> 00:23:45,980
The issue with that is the CDC has 
already proven to skew statistics and,

549
00:23:45,990 --> 00:23:48,470
and to not actually provide good 
research.

550
00:23:48,530 --> 00:23:53,530
What research is it that they want?
So the CDC used to be able to do 

551
00:23:53,530 --> 00:23:56,480
research on gun violence prevention and 
just figure out what's going on.

552
00:23:56,690 --> 00:23:59,030
But it's been proven time and time again
that they screw their statistics.

553
00:23:59,040 --> 00:24:00,110
So the Fargo and was like,
no,

554
00:24:00,111 --> 00:24:02,680
we're not allowing you to penetrate a 
false myth,

555
00:24:03,020 --> 00:24:03,660
a myth.

556
00:24:04,380 --> 00:24:09,380
So basically they stopped funding.
The next thing is that they want high 

557
00:24:09,380 --> 00:24:09,380
capacity magazines.
Uh,

558
00:24:09,410 --> 00:24:12,110
there is no distinction there.
There was no difference.

559
00:24:12,380 --> 00:24:16,180
That shows that high capacity magazines,
whatever that means,

560
00:24:16,390 --> 00:24:19,160
can do more damage than simply having 
more like clips.

561
00:24:19,530 --> 00:24:22,580
I'm just having smaller,
having larger clips,

562
00:24:22,581 --> 00:24:27,581
but less of them.
There's no distinction that actually 

563
00:24:27,581 --> 00:24:27,980
does more damage to the next thing that 
they want to do is band semiauto rifles.

564
00:24:28,130 --> 00:24:31,430
As I've said before,
only three percent of all gun deaths are

565
00:24:31,431 --> 00:24:36,431
with rifles.
So banning them does absolutely nothing 

566
00:24:36,431 --> 00:24:38,990
addressing the issue in lowering a gun.
Violence is making sure that we have,

567
00:24:39,310 --> 00:24:39,690
uh,
uh,

568
00:24:39,770 --> 00:24:44,770
making sure that we have more people who
are armed because there's a direct 

569
00:24:44,770 --> 00:24:44,770
correlation,
not causation,

570
00:24:44,770 --> 00:24:47,030
but correlation that when we increase 
farm,

571
00:24:47,100 --> 00:24:49,010
um,
ownership and concealed carry permits in

572
00:24:49,011 --> 00:24:50,180
addition,
um,

573
00:24:50,390 --> 00:24:55,390
violent crime goes down.
So the next thing that I'd like to 

574
00:24:55,390 --> 00:24:55,390
propose is what about Great Britain and 
Australia?

575
00:24:55,390 --> 00:24:59,920
So in Great Britain there was a,
there's a ban on guns and immediately 

576
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:01,460
after violent crime spiked.
And in addition,

577
00:25:01,461 --> 00:25:06,461
you have armed robberies increased.
So violent crime increased immediately 

578
00:25:06,461 --> 00:25:10,721
after and burglaries in Great Britain,
60 percent of them occur when the 

579
00:25:11,180 --> 00:25:13,480
individuals at home versus 13 percent of
the US.

580
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:18,520
So burglars have admitted that they do 
this because they know that the person 

581
00:25:18,520 --> 00:25:19,810
will have like the purse or whatever,
and they won't,

582
00:25:19,850 --> 00:25:21,770
there'll be on arm.
So violent crime spike.

583
00:25:21,820 --> 00:25:22,760
The next thing is they say,
hey,

584
00:25:22,761 --> 00:25:27,761
Kyla,
what about the Australian gun by 

585
00:25:27,761 --> 00:25:28,010
program?
So already in Australia when the program

586
00:25:28,011 --> 00:25:30,380
was initiated,
there was already statistical zero,

587
00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:32,010
uh,
for,

588
00:25:32,230 --> 00:25:32,960
uh,
you know,

589
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:35,930
gun death and public mass public school 
shootings.

590
00:25:36,460 --> 00:25:38,180
Um,
so in addition,

591
00:25:38,181 --> 00:25:39,710
when the buyback gets implemented there 
already,

592
00:25:39,711 --> 00:25:44,711
we're like the millions,
millions less guns in Australia than 

593
00:25:44,711 --> 00:25:44,900
there were now.
So the gun buyback grows in,

594
00:25:44,901 --> 00:25:47,270
only one third of guns get taken.

595
00:25:47,660 --> 00:25:52,660
And when we saw immediately after the 
buyback was that violent crime spiked.

596
00:25:53,630 --> 00:25:58,630
So here's just the basic argument,
there is not been one single occurrence 

597
00:25:58,630 --> 00:26:00,660
where gun control gets passed and,
and,

598
00:26:00,820 --> 00:26:05,390
and gun deaths,
no gun homicides actually decreases at a

599
00:26:05,391 --> 00:26:06,440
faster rate.
In Australia,

600
00:26:06,441 --> 00:26:09,740
the gun,
the homicide rate was already decreasing

601
00:26:09,741 --> 00:26:14,741
at a really good rate.
It gets passed gun control and the rate 

602
00:26:15,080 --> 00:26:20,080
stalls.
So it actually hurt an addition 

603
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:20,720
immediately after it was passed to 
violent crime rates go up.

604
00:26:20,900 --> 00:26:25,900
And the national trend was going down,
so the gun buyback program was 

605
00:26:25,900 --> 00:26:27,590
completely ineffective,
did absolutely nothing,

606
00:26:27,620 --> 00:26:32,120
and then it failed on such a huge level 
in Australia that implementing it in the

607
00:26:32,121 --> 00:26:35,570
US with 270 million guns simply won't 
work.

608
00:26:35,650 --> 00:26:40,650
All right,
so let's shift the discussion a little 

609
00:26:40,650 --> 00:26:42,401
bit to the NRA because that was the 
other part of this that during the town 

610
00:26:42,401 --> 00:26:44,670
hall and the subsequent discussions

611
00:26:45,030 --> 00:26:49,500
that it got very confused as to what the
NRA actually does.

612
00:26:49,501 --> 00:26:54,501
What do they want to do?
What are their people who don't like 

613
00:26:54,501 --> 00:26:54,501
them,
think they do,

614
00:26:54,501 --> 00:26:54,501
et Cetera,
et cetera.

615
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:56,280
Um,
so first off,

616
00:26:56,281 --> 00:26:58,890
just give me your position on the NRA 
general.

617
00:26:59,020 --> 00:27:02,820
I think the NRA is a fantastic 
organization that defends the rights,

618
00:27:03,210 --> 00:27:08,210
the right to bear arms of individuals.
Thing with the NRA is that they really 

619
00:27:08,210 --> 00:27:10,140
don't have the money influence that 
people say they do.

620
00:27:10,230 --> 00:27:15,230
All they have is the social influence.
Republican senators know that the base 

621
00:27:16,500 --> 00:27:19,050
believes in the values that the NRA 
promotes and defense.

622
00:27:19,080 --> 00:27:20,880
And they understand that.
And if they go against the NRA,

623
00:27:20,881 --> 00:27:23,040
they're going against their own 
constituents.

624
00:27:23,250 --> 00:27:25,620
The NRA does not have a big budget.
They really don't.

625
00:27:25,770 --> 00:27:28,920
They're not like this super powerful 
like that.

626
00:27:28,921 --> 00:27:32,610
They directly control senators and 
congressmen with their money.

627
00:27:32,611 --> 00:27:35,370
They control with their ideals.
What the NRA does,

628
00:27:35,371 --> 00:27:39,300
which is fantastic,
is it provides a check from the,

629
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:44,360
from the public,
not from the government for defending 

630
00:27:44,360 --> 00:27:45,600
our right to bear arms and it's 
fantastic.

631
00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:50,880
You know,
it helped I think with the case with 

632
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:53,691
Mcdonald's for Chicago that helped 
bolster a second amendment rights for 

633
00:27:53,731 --> 00:27:54,240
individuals.

634
00:27:54,560 --> 00:27:57,000
I mean,
and the NRA does just does a great job.

635
00:27:57,001 --> 00:28:00,150
They're NRA Ila program,
which is actually the legislative branch

636
00:28:00,450 --> 00:28:02,730
on defending the second amendment,
does a fantastic job.

637
00:28:03,060 --> 00:28:06,210
I think right now they're taking a case 
against raising the age from 18 to 21.

638
00:28:06,270 --> 00:28:10,590
There was right for the shooting of Rick
Scott signed into law in Florida,

639
00:28:10,591 --> 00:28:14,610
raising the age to buy,
I think a firearm or rifle now.

640
00:28:14,700 --> 00:28:16,200
So before,
before,

641
00:28:16,450 --> 00:28:21,450
uh,
you couldn't buy a handgun if you're 

642
00:28:21,450 --> 00:28:24,381
under 21,
but you could buy a rifle because 

643
00:28:24,381 --> 00:28:24,381
handguns were used in violent crimes.
Whether I think that's right or not,

644
00:28:24,381 --> 00:28:26,090
that's a separate discussion.
But he raised the age from 18,

645
00:28:26,110 --> 00:28:29,250
21 to buy a rifle and directly the NRA 
was like,

646
00:28:29,251 --> 00:28:31,680
this is unconstitutional.
Boom.

647
00:28:31,681 --> 00:28:33,420
We put it in the lawsuit just to address
that.

648
00:28:33,421 --> 00:28:35,950
Eighteen to 21 age.
Uh,

649
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:39,180
there is absolutely no evidence that 
raising the age does absolutely.

650
00:28:39,240 --> 00:28:40,590
Does,
does anything to,

651
00:28:40,591 --> 00:28:41,460
uh,
to lower,

652
00:28:41,461 --> 00:28:42,990
um,
gun homicide whatsoever.

653
00:28:43,030 --> 00:28:48,030
So what do you think about the certain 
set of people that think that if we 

654
00:28:48,030 --> 00:28:50,341
could just have all of the right laws or
if we could just manage everything 

655
00:28:50,341 --> 00:28:52,060
properly,
that everything would be fine because he

656
00:28:52,061 --> 00:28:54,340
doesn't take into fingers.
We have a ball.

657
00:28:54,360 --> 00:28:56,820
All the laws that we need already on the
books as thing,

658
00:28:56,821 --> 00:28:59,740
as the enforcement doesn't work.
So I'll just make a tangent.

659
00:28:59,741 --> 00:29:04,741
I'll get back to here.
I think it is utterly hypocritical that 

660
00:29:04,741 --> 00:29:05,070
the left hates trump and they,
that he's in power,

661
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,100
but then they're saying we have to trust
they cover more.

662
00:29:08,101 --> 00:29:10,800
So if you think the government,
if you think trump is literally Hitler,

663
00:29:10,801 --> 00:29:14,190
why are you giving away your right to 
bear arms to this tyrannical government?

664
00:29:14,680 --> 00:29:16,620
Um,
it was the question again.

665
00:29:17,390 --> 00:29:22,390
Well,
just that there's a certain set of 

666
00:29:22,390 --> 00:29:22,390
people that think if we,

667
00:29:22,390 --> 00:29:23,310
I got you.
So we already have the,

668
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:25,670
the laws on the books,
you know,

669
00:29:25,730 --> 00:29:29,150
just the enforcement and the enforcement
of what needs to occur.

670
00:29:29,151 --> 00:29:30,650
Like the Lautenberg amendment means that
domain,

671
00:29:30,760 --> 00:29:35,760
it says that domestic abusers cannot 
have a firearm that's already on the 

672
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:36,470
books.
It just needs to be enforced.

673
00:29:36,620 --> 00:29:39,350
There's the issue with um,
you know,

674
00:29:39,410 --> 00:29:42,790
the nics background check program where 
they say we need more time to,

675
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:48,520
to evaluate and give you back your 
background check in order to buy a 

676
00:29:48,520 --> 00:29:48,580
weapon.
The issue is the government doesn't need

677
00:29:48,581 --> 00:29:50,830
more time,
it just needs more of the records.

678
00:29:51,040 --> 00:29:54,190
So the reason why the Texas oil and 
shooting occurred was because I think it

679
00:29:54,191 --> 00:29:57,130
was some military brands where there was
someone where he,

680
00:29:57,180 --> 00:30:00,170
he committed a violation and by law they
sh the heat.

681
00:30:00,250 --> 00:30:02,550
They should have transferred that over 
to the database and there,

682
00:30:02,551 --> 00:30:03,820
if we wouldn't have been able to buy a 
weapon,

683
00:30:03,821 --> 00:30:05,260
but the records weren't transferred.

684
00:30:05,260 --> 00:30:07,630
He was able to buy a weapon and he shot 
up the church.

685
00:30:07,990 --> 00:30:11,590
So the government just needs to get all 
the records and do their job.

686
00:30:11,591 --> 00:30:13,960
Same thing with red flag laws,
um,

687
00:30:14,650 --> 00:30:19,650
and people like to talk about this.
This is a little bit more of the 

688
00:30:19,650 --> 00:30:21,690
trickier areas of this,
but red flag laws basically say that 

689
00:30:21,690 --> 00:30:26,041
someone can flag you and then you get 
reviewed and then you can get your gun 

690
00:30:26,041 --> 00:30:27,850
taken away.
And a lot of people also like.

691
00:30:28,180 --> 00:30:33,180
So the issue with red flag gun laws is 
that it's all about government 

692
00:30:33,180 --> 00:30:33,760
enforcement and,
and that's,

693
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:39,000
that's the issue.
And there's also the big issue where 

694
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:40,510
people like to talk about mental health 
and they say you're mentally ill,

695
00:30:40,511 --> 00:30:42,040
people shouldn't be able to acquire 
weapon.

696
00:30:42,550 --> 00:30:47,550
So I have talked to countless 
individuals about this and I should ask 

697
00:30:47,550 --> 00:30:50,220
Peterson but I forgot to.
The question is how do you determine 

698
00:30:50,220 --> 00:30:52,120
when someone is mentally ill enough and 
hits the threshold so they cannot have a

699
00:30:52,121 --> 00:30:57,121
weapon and nobody knows.
And in addition to things with the 

700
00:30:57,121 --> 00:30:58,480
shooter at my school looking 
retroactively,

701
00:30:58,481 --> 00:31:03,481
we can say this kid was mentally insane,
but I don't know if a court would 

702
00:31:03,481 --> 00:31:06,691
adjudicate that.
He would actually be mentally insane by 

703
00:31:06,691 --> 00:31:07,030
by law,
therefore taking his gun away.

704
00:31:07,160 --> 00:31:08,960
Yeah.
So is the inherent problem here.

705
00:31:08,961 --> 00:31:12,410
Do you think that you cannot manage all 
of these things?

706
00:31:12,411 --> 00:31:16,520
You can do the best you can to have some
sensible laws around them and defend our

707
00:31:16,521 --> 00:31:20,330
right to bear arms and all of that and 
make sure schools are taken care of,

708
00:31:20,331 --> 00:31:22,070
but that generally speaking,
yes,

709
00:31:22,280 --> 00:31:24,440
there's a sort of sliding scale 
psychologically,

710
00:31:24,441 --> 00:31:28,010
but also that the people that want to do
bad,

711
00:31:28,340 --> 00:31:33,340
we'll find ways to do bad.
They're not the ones that are walking 

712
00:31:33,340 --> 00:31:33,340
out and looking at a building and it 
says,

713
00:31:33,340 --> 00:31:35,300
oh no guns here,
so not going to walk in with a gun.

714
00:31:36,250 --> 00:31:39,610
Criminals will act like criminals no 
matter what,

715
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:42,430
but the good thing is that our laws are 
working.

716
00:31:42,490 --> 00:31:47,490
I mean,
I think it's violent crime or some rate 

717
00:31:47,490 --> 00:31:50,580
from the 1998 to 2010 has decreased by 
50 percent and and pub in schools are 

718
00:31:53,531 --> 00:31:58,531
safer now than they were 20 years ago.
Like school shooting rates are declining

719
00:31:59,500 --> 00:32:00,430
and homicide,
right?

720
00:32:00,431 --> 00:32:03,430
Gun homicide rates are declining in the 
homicide rates are declining.

721
00:32:03,610 --> 00:32:08,610
So we're becoming a more peaceful nation
and a lot of that has to do with having 

722
00:32:08,610 --> 00:32:13,561
more gun owners and to having more 
concealed carry permit owners because 

723
00:32:13,561 --> 00:32:17,020
those people,
when when there's a shooting,

724
00:32:17,140 --> 00:32:21,280
those people are the first responders.
I think it's wrong to say that.

725
00:32:21,310 --> 00:32:24,580
Oh well we'll just let the police arrive
after the crime has been committed.

726
00:32:24,581 --> 00:32:29,581
No,
you need people there immediately to 

727
00:32:29,581 --> 00:32:31,321
stop the shooter.
That's why I'm all for having teachers 

728
00:32:31,321 --> 00:32:32,710
and arm school officers at schools to 
immediately take down the shooter.

729
00:32:33,020 --> 00:32:34,310
All right,
so let's shift.

730
00:32:34,370 --> 00:32:39,370
I mean,
I don't think we're going to fully get 

731
00:32:39,370 --> 00:32:39,370
away from guns here,
but let's shift a little bit.

732
00:32:39,370 --> 00:32:42,371
Okay.
What is it like to be a 17 year old 

733
00:32:42,371 --> 00:32:45,230
right now that's in the mix of this?
That's now a public person.

734
00:32:45,770 --> 00:32:46,570
Crazy.
Yeah.

735
00:32:46,610 --> 00:32:51,610
To just be part of this,
this oddly unique time where it feels 

736
00:32:51,610 --> 00:32:56,441
like the adults have lost the plot and 
it's got to be very hard for you to find

737
00:32:56,481 --> 00:33:01,481
people that kind of makes sense.
I think you've been able to find a 

738
00:33:01,481 --> 00:33:04,601
couple of them,
but just to be 17 in this very odd 

739
00:33:04,601 --> 00:33:06,780
political cultural time.
It's insane.

740
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:13,960
Like what does it feel unique to you?
I know you haven't lived through this 

741
00:33:13,960 --> 00:33:13,960
before,
but like

742
00:33:13,960 --> 00:33:18,540
they don't know how to judge it.
All I know is that I'm an adult now and 

743
00:33:19,661 --> 00:33:23,110
I have to act like an adult,
whether whether I'm 17 or 18,

744
00:33:23,111 --> 00:33:24,910
I have committed like commitments that I
make.

745
00:33:24,911 --> 00:33:26,560
I have to go through with them and I've 
just.

746
00:33:26,620 --> 00:33:28,630
My immaturity,
I was forced to become mature.

747
00:33:28,631 --> 00:33:31,150
Like I can no longer play video games 
and waste time.

748
00:33:31,450 --> 00:33:36,450
There's things that I have to do but 
I've just been so blessed to find a 

749
00:33:36,450 --> 00:33:39,400
solid group of people who actually care 
about me and want the best for me.

750
00:33:39,520 --> 00:33:42,280
Like,
like Ben and Charlie Guy,

751
00:33:42,281 --> 00:33:47,281
Benson.
People who have just reached out to me 

752
00:33:47,281 --> 00:33:48,040
and I'm just selflessly helped me 
navigate this political minefield.

753
00:33:48,430 --> 00:33:53,430
But it's crazy [inaudible] like all the 
people that I looked up to like two 

754
00:33:53,430 --> 00:33:55,760
years ago and like watch their videos,
like not gonna snack,

755
00:33:55,780 --> 00:33:56,950
trying to like boost your ego here.

756
00:33:56,950 --> 00:33:58,480
But I used to,
I would watch her show,

757
00:33:59,860 --> 00:34:02,110
please continue,
but yeah,

758
00:34:02,111 --> 00:34:05,320
it's awesome that now I can reach out 
for their expertise.

759
00:34:05,370 --> 00:34:07,810
The thing with me is that I always like 
to start with,

760
00:34:07,811 --> 00:34:12,811
look,
I don't know anything and I'm always 

761
00:34:12,811 --> 00:34:12,811
looking to get more information to know 
more.

762
00:34:12,811 --> 00:34:15,370
Like today I had a call with a gun 
expert.

763
00:34:16,070 --> 00:34:21,070
I'm on the way here and it's like,
what more can I learn in order to be 

764
00:34:21,070 --> 00:34:23,530
like fully fluent and,
and knowledgeable about the subject that

765
00:34:23,531 --> 00:34:26,800
I'm talking about and there are a bunch 
of stuff that I don't know about and I'm

766
00:34:26,801 --> 00:34:27,940
constantly trying to learn.

767
00:34:28,150 --> 00:34:31,030
So when you see a guy,
and again I don't like making this about

768
00:34:31,031 --> 00:34:36,031
people rather than ideas,
but when you see a guy like David Hogg 

769
00:34:36,031 --> 00:34:39,991
out there and he clearly is taking just 
the progressive line on this and he 

770
00:34:39,991 --> 00:34:43,891
seems more to me to be sort of a 
progressive activists than sort of a,

771
00:34:44,660 --> 00:34:48,060
a fair arbiter of what's going on here.
Um,

772
00:34:48,760 --> 00:34:53,170
that's gotta be frustrating for you that
he's so public about this.

773
00:34:53,171 --> 00:34:58,171
I suppose so.
Well that you obviously probably 

774
00:34:58,171 --> 00:35:00,210
disagree with him on on 100 percent of 
the policy parts.

775
00:35:00,220 --> 00:35:00,990
This is true.
Yeah.

776
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:02,560
I don't want to make it about the 
personal part,

777
00:35:02,890 --> 00:35:07,890
but that he's thought of as sort of a 
media hero and you're kind of the black 

778
00:35:07,890 --> 00:35:09,940
sheep of this group.
I mean maybe not to the,

779
00:35:09,970 --> 00:35:12,010
to the Shapiros and me and whoever else.

780
00:35:12,460 --> 00:35:13,960
Yeah.
So here's what I say.

781
00:35:14,740 --> 00:35:16,810
There is no issue that kids are on 
television.

782
00:35:17,140 --> 00:35:22,140
The issue is is that when someone is 
spouting policy that they are no longer 

783
00:35:22,140 --> 00:35:26,641
a child,
they are pushing policy and they should 

784
00:35:26,641 --> 00:35:26,641
be treated as every adult does such when
you say something outrageous,

785
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:29,480
you should be called out on that.
Remember there's a segment with you.

786
00:35:29,820 --> 00:35:34,270
It was on cnn where he said something 
completely outlandish a and there was no

787
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:35,560
blowback Solo.

788
00:35:35,940 --> 00:35:37,800
Well,
I think it was that the line Marco Rubio

789
00:35:37,801 --> 00:35:39,170
wants to kill kids or something.

790
00:35:39,260 --> 00:35:40,620
That's crazy.
Yeah.

791
00:35:40,930 --> 00:35:43,840
So what I say is when I'm pushing policy
and I say thanks to the police,

792
00:35:43,870 --> 00:35:46,930
like tell me that I'm saying something 
stupid and pushed me back on that.

793
00:35:47,140 --> 00:35:50,020
The thing is with me that look when I'm 
on TV,

794
00:35:50,230 --> 00:35:51,880
I'm not talking as a child and pushing 
policy,

795
00:35:52,360 --> 00:35:54,880
right.
And I expect there to be pushed back.

796
00:35:55,120 --> 00:35:58,180
I don't think you can say whatever you 
want like and in addition,

797
00:35:59,380 --> 00:36:02,500
I think that having debate is great.
So like I love,

798
00:36:02,620 --> 00:36:07,620
I love going on piers Morgan and having 
a debate with that was great and I think

799
00:36:07,721 --> 00:36:10,690
we have to.
I hate this thing where like we're,

800
00:36:10,750 --> 00:36:15,750
we're one second you're spouting policy,
but then you rushed back to the Dust 

801
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:16,900
Shield of Oh,
I'm a child,

802
00:36:16,930 --> 00:36:20,140
but we have to take my opinion seriously
because the second I said I'm an adult,

803
00:36:20,500 --> 00:36:21,850
so just,
just this isn't,

804
00:36:21,851 --> 00:36:23,980
this isn't fair.
And what I saw,

805
00:36:24,700 --> 00:36:29,700
I think one of the reasons why I grew to
such publicity was because I was saying 

806
00:36:31,241 --> 00:36:32,980
the things that adults weren't able to 
say.

807
00:36:32,981 --> 00:36:37,981
Like I was able to say things that Ben 
Shapiro or you or Charlie Kirk or the 

808
00:36:37,981 --> 00:36:41,560
right wasn't able to say because I'm a 
kid and I don't think that's fair.

809
00:36:41,561 --> 00:36:43,360
Because I think that when you're 
spouting policy,

810
00:36:43,361 --> 00:36:45,400
you are no longer a child.
You're an adult,

811
00:36:46,030 --> 00:36:51,030
what do you make of what's going on with
the right generally because you ran the 

812
00:36:51,030 --> 00:36:55,231
turning point.
Was that the high school event that I 

813
00:36:55,231 --> 00:36:55,231
did?
I've done so many scholarships on you.

814
00:36:55,231 --> 00:36:59,970
Okay.
So you did the high school leadership 

815
00:36:59,970 --> 00:37:01,441
summit in DC and I spoke there.
This is a couple of months ago and you 

816
00:37:01,441 --> 00:37:03,270
had a great lineup of speakers and Peter
till is there and you had big,

817
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:05,590
big time politicians and,
and first off,

818
00:37:05,710 --> 00:37:07,300
I mean that was the first time we met 
and I was like,

819
00:37:07,301 --> 00:37:09,250
Holy Shit.
We just debate about abortion.

820
00:37:10,020 --> 00:37:11,030
Abortion.
Exactly.

821
00:37:11,290 --> 00:37:13,000
So that's my point.
So first of all,

822
00:37:13,020 --> 00:37:13,480
you,
you,

823
00:37:13,540 --> 00:37:15,210
you ran this whole thing.
I mean you're,

824
00:37:15,211 --> 00:37:16,600
you're,
you're still in high school,

825
00:37:16,601 --> 00:37:21,601
right?
We're going to talk a little bit about 

826
00:37:21,601 --> 00:37:21,601
where you want to go to college and all 
that,

827
00:37:21,601 --> 00:37:22,960
but you ran an incredible event with 
major prime time people and,

828
00:37:23,050 --> 00:37:28,050
and it was,
it was jam packed and it was a diverse 

829
00:37:28,050 --> 00:37:28,210
in terms of ideas.

830
00:37:28,210 --> 00:37:30,610
So we get into a private debate about 
abortion,

831
00:37:31,030 --> 00:37:33,100
but you brought me there.
Uh,

832
00:37:33,650 --> 00:37:34,840
and I went up there.
Thanks.

833
00:37:34,841 --> 00:37:39,841
But I,
I went up there and I talked about my 

834
00:37:39,841 --> 00:37:40,600
differences with this group I talked 
about and the kids were respectful and I

835
00:37:40,601 --> 00:37:45,601
talked about gay marriage and abortion 
and death penalty in a couple of other 

836
00:37:45,601 --> 00:37:47,230
things that generally these young 
conservatives are not for.

837
00:37:47,231 --> 00:37:49,600
I think gay marriage there pretty much 
for.

838
00:37:49,620 --> 00:37:52,260
I hope that the ship has sailed on that 
one actually.

839
00:37:52,420 --> 00:37:53,920
I'm pretty sure I got a huge ovation on 
that.

840
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:59,560
Um,
but it is just clear to me that there 

841
00:37:59,560 --> 00:38:02,371
has been a realignment on the right 
where there is exactly what you're 

842
00:38:02,371 --> 00:38:02,440
talking about.

843
00:38:03,860 --> 00:38:05,420
Can we just say that Lindsey Graham?
Two point.

844
00:38:05,421 --> 00:38:06,170
Oh is fantastic.

845
00:38:06,260 --> 00:38:06,710
No,
the guy.

846
00:38:06,711 --> 00:38:07,970
It's unbelievable that,
I mean,

847
00:38:07,971 --> 00:38:12,971
just that one thing with the tie the 
daily caller.

848
00:38:14,600 --> 00:38:14,810
Right.

849
00:38:14,930 --> 00:38:18,760
So I think the rightest finally 
realizing that youth,

850
00:38:18,860 --> 00:38:23,860
um,
and like energizing the youth and 

851
00:38:23,860 --> 00:38:26,940
instilling the next future of 
conservative leaders is extremely 

852
00:38:26,940 --> 00:38:29,731
important.
And we saw that with the high school 

853
00:38:29,731 --> 00:38:31,400
leadership summit.
We had some of the biggest names speak 

854
00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:34,430
like Nikki Haley.
That's advice we'd like turning jeff 

855
00:38:34,430 --> 00:38:38,140
sessions we had so people.
And every week we had Mark Meadows.

856
00:38:38,141 --> 00:38:39,100
We had Steve scully's,
we had,

857
00:38:39,130 --> 00:38:43,360
we had,
we had prager u and it was just,

858
00:38:43,361 --> 00:38:48,361
it was fantastic to see the right.
Just understand that these are the 

859
00:38:48,361 --> 00:38:50,770
leaders of tomorrow,
let's inform them,

860
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:55,800
but in addition,
turning point is such a great 

861
00:38:55,800 --> 00:38:55,800
organization.
It's free speech,

862
00:38:55,800 --> 00:38:58,630
free markets and capitalism.
Those are the three legs.

863
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:04,000
Uh,
and what we saw with turning point is 

864
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,901
such a,
it's such a great organization because 

865
00:39:06,901 --> 00:39:08,671
we were,
we brought people who I have 

866
00:39:08,671 --> 00:39:09,460
disagreements with to speak there.
Mark Cuban spoke,

867
00:39:09,870 --> 00:39:14,870
got a couple standing ovations,
had a debate with Charlie and people 

868
00:39:14,870 --> 00:39:17,170
loved it.
So we're all open having free discussion

869
00:39:17,171 --> 00:39:18,520
and debate.
Like we're,

870
00:39:18,521 --> 00:39:23,521
we're,
we're working on sassal shooting action 

871
00:39:23,521 --> 00:39:23,521
summit,
December 19,

872
00:39:23,521 --> 00:39:23,521
20 seconds,
shameless plug.

873
00:39:23,990 --> 00:39:28,990
And we're,
we're looking like how can we get the 

874
00:39:28,990 --> 00:39:31,501
most diverse group of people to speak?
Like I'm thinking about something from 

875
00:39:31,501 --> 00:39:31,660
the intellectual dark web to speak 
there.

876
00:39:31,661 --> 00:39:36,100
I think it's great if we can get Alan 
Dershowitz just how can we get diversity

877
00:39:36,101 --> 00:39:36,400
of thought?

878
00:39:36,570 --> 00:39:40,020
So why is it that these new right or 
whatever you want to call it,

879
00:39:40,021 --> 00:39:43,800
young conservative group,
whatever it is.

880
00:39:43,950 --> 00:39:48,270
Why is it that you guys are able to do 
this and I see virtually none of this

881
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:52,100
on your counterparts on the left.
That's not true.

882
00:39:52,101 --> 00:39:54,770
I mean the left has organize and 
mobilize youth dish right now.

883
00:39:55,350 --> 00:39:55,730
Well,
I mean,

884
00:39:55,770 --> 00:39:55,930
no,
no,

885
00:39:55,931 --> 00:40:00,931
no,
but I'm talking about diversity of 

886
00:40:00,931 --> 00:40:02,101
thought.
Like where are they bringing a mildly 

887
00:40:02,101 --> 00:40:05,611
disagree with.
I'm not talking about scary 

888
00:40:05,611 --> 00:40:07,321
conservatives.
I'm talking about old school liberals 

889
00:40:07,321 --> 00:40:09,691
were.
Where are they inviting them to just 

890
00:40:09,691 --> 00:40:09,691
have an interesting conversation.
Yes.

891
00:40:09,691 --> 00:40:12,250
Just so dead set on political 
correctness and saying everything to not

892
00:40:12,251 --> 00:40:16,660
offend anyone with the slightest micro 
micro micro aggression that is just.

893
00:40:16,810 --> 00:40:21,810
You can't live in that world and and 
tall like logical liberals like yourself

894
00:40:22,930 --> 00:40:23,460
are moving

895
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:28,520
to the right.
These subtle little injections of 

896
00:40:28,520 --> 00:40:28,520
pleasantry yeah,
that's nice.

897
00:40:28,590 --> 00:40:29,920
Are moving people to the

898
00:40:29,960 --> 00:40:31,910
right and conservatives are like,
come here,

899
00:40:31,911 --> 00:40:32,600
my.
He is.

900
00:40:32,601 --> 00:40:34,430
My political refugees were embracing 
you.

901
00:40:34,550 --> 00:40:35,240
Yeah.
So.

902
00:40:35,241 --> 00:40:36,650
Okay.
So when I hear people will say,

903
00:40:36,651 --> 00:40:38,830
Ruben,
the conservatives are just using you.

904
00:40:38,831 --> 00:40:41,030
You go to turning point.
They were just using you.

905
00:40:42,770 --> 00:40:44,370
You're not just using Mikael.
No,

906
00:40:45,130 --> 00:40:45,540
I mean,
yeah,

907
00:40:45,710 --> 00:40:47,290
no,
no,

908
00:40:47,300 --> 00:40:52,300
but really,
I mean what I've seen is intellectual 

909
00:40:52,300 --> 00:40:54,311
flexibility there and it's even when 
I've had been in here and we've done 

910
00:40:54,311 --> 00:40:55,610
this conversation repeatedly now about 
gay marriage,

911
00:40:55,611 --> 00:40:59,510
I just firmly believe that as time goes 
on I can shift him.

912
00:40:59,540 --> 00:41:04,540
I,
there's something that's sort of 

913
00:41:04,540 --> 00:41:05,831
insulting about it to me.
When people say that to me because I'm 

914
00:41:05,831 --> 00:41:05,831
confident,
I'm confident enough in my,

915
00:41:06,260 --> 00:41:11,260
he's going to take you on abortion.
I really think that like in a few years 

916
00:41:11,260 --> 00:41:11,260
you'll be with us on a board

917
00:41:11,260 --> 00:41:11,800
mean maybe,
but you know what?

918
00:41:11,801 --> 00:41:13,060
That would be a trade off,
right?

919
00:41:13,061 --> 00:41:13,750
Like if,
if,

920
00:41:13,810 --> 00:41:16,600
if ultimately I always described myself 
as begrudgingly

921
00:41:18,190 --> 00:41:20,770
of of homosexuality.
While I don't,

922
00:41:20,771 --> 00:41:25,771
I don't,
I don't have a strong opinion on it 

923
00:41:25,771 --> 00:41:25,771
because I haven't thought about it 
enough.

924
00:41:25,771 --> 00:41:26,790
By his religious standpoint.
It makes sense,

925
00:41:26,791 --> 00:41:29,760
but from the government standpoint,
it also makes total sense.

926
00:41:29,830 --> 00:41:31,630
Well,
that's why I'm completely fine with him.

927
00:41:31,631 --> 00:41:33,220
It's like you want to have your 
religious.

928
00:41:33,560 --> 00:41:36,420
I have to respect that,
but if you are trying to legislate,

929
00:41:37,630 --> 00:41:41,340
the great thing with the right is that 
we're open to this diversity of thought.

930
00:41:41,370 --> 00:41:43,890
Just say whatever you want,
let's talk about it and let's get to the

931
00:41:43,891 --> 00:41:46,240
right rational viewpoint.
Like I've,

932
00:41:46,241 --> 00:41:49,680
I've always been about the bait because 
it brings people,

933
00:41:50,520 --> 00:41:54,420
it's all about logic and it brings 
people to the right end result.

934
00:41:54,980 --> 00:41:58,460
So when I'm on tour with Peterson,
a w,

935
00:41:58,550 --> 00:42:02,240
the question that I think both of us get
asked more than anything else is,

936
00:42:02,241 --> 00:42:07,241
what are the best techniques to wake 
people up out of this sort of postmodern

937
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:08,900
identity,
politics,

938
00:42:08,901 --> 00:42:13,901
progressive group.
Think as a young person in the midst of 

939
00:42:13,901 --> 00:42:17,411
this,
what would you say are some techniques 

940
00:42:17,411 --> 00:42:19,490
you've been able to use?
Because it can't just be about drubbing 

941
00:42:19,490 --> 00:42:19,490
them with facts,

942
00:42:19,490 --> 00:42:19,490
right?
I mean,

943
00:42:19,490 --> 00:42:22,910
the left is doing a fantastic job with.
They're just craziness and pushing 

944
00:42:22,910 --> 00:42:26,061
people to the right.
So it's just sort of doing it on 

945
00:42:26,061 --> 00:42:26,061
himself.
Um,

946
00:42:26,061 --> 00:42:27,480
well what we saw right now with canyon 
and in addition,

947
00:42:27,481 --> 00:42:29,280
it's just,
he was simply saying,

948
00:42:29,550 --> 00:42:30,990
freedom of expression,
freedom of thought.

949
00:42:31,020 --> 00:42:33,330
I support the president.
Our president has to be the freshest,

950
00:42:33,331 --> 00:42:38,331
the flies thoughts.
I'm just pushing people to diversity of 

951
00:42:38,331 --> 00:42:43,311
thought and freedom of expression to 
think whatever you want you shouldn't 

952
00:42:43,311 --> 00:42:46,041
have.
You shouldn't be held down by your skin 

953
00:42:46,041 --> 00:42:47,691
color or your race or your sexuality.
Like none of this matters.

954
00:42:48,930 --> 00:42:53,520
You should be able to think what you 
want and be able to say it without being

955
00:42:53,521 --> 00:42:55,590
tied down by you know,
your identity.

956
00:42:55,910 --> 00:43:00,910
Yeah.
How do you make sure that you don't get 

957
00:43:00,910 --> 00:43:02,771
burned out?
Because I think I remember the first 

958
00:43:02,771 --> 00:43:03,200
communication we ever had.
I think when either you followed me or I

959
00:43:03,201 --> 00:43:08,201
followed you on twitter.
I just sent you a quick one line note 

960
00:43:08,201 --> 00:43:10,841
and I was just like,
just don't get burned out because I saw 

961
00:43:10,841 --> 00:43:10,841
you just.
You were in the fight everyday.

962
00:43:10,880 --> 00:43:12,380
You were,
you were owning,

963
00:43:12,410 --> 00:43:14,150
owning the libs and all that.
Which by the way,

964
00:43:14,151 --> 00:43:19,151
you know,
you mentioned that Nikki Haley was at 

965
00:43:19,151 --> 00:43:19,151
your summit and she went,
she went to to,

966
00:43:19,270 --> 00:43:20,120
you know,
in effect,

967
00:43:20,121 --> 00:43:23,090
what is a,
a lot of trump people right at this,

968
00:43:23,091 --> 00:43:25,700
at this event you put on.
She goes there and she says,

969
00:43:26,090 --> 00:43:31,090
you know,
don't make this about just owning the 

970
00:43:31,090 --> 00:43:33,041
libs and she got applause for it and I,
I hit that same point I think the next 

971
00:43:33,041 --> 00:43:35,870
day because I think if you guys do 
exactly what you just laid out,

972
00:43:35,871 --> 00:43:39,020
just kind of stand there.
It would be cool and be decent.

973
00:43:39,280 --> 00:43:40,710
You'll,
you will welcome a lot of them.

974
00:43:40,780 --> 00:43:41,620
Well,
I think,

975
00:43:41,710 --> 00:43:45,090
I honestly believe that decency wins.
Can we just take a second and that Nikki

976
00:43:45,090 --> 00:43:46,380
Haley is fantastic and I,
I,

977
00:43:46,690 --> 00:43:49,360
I kind of cried for like a week ever 
since.

978
00:43:50,010 --> 00:43:55,010
What do you think that this is perhaps a
paving the road for her running at some 

979
00:43:55,010 --> 00:43:55,010
point?

980
00:43:55,010 --> 00:43:56,620
I don't know.
There's so many 40 chests,

981
00:43:57,670 --> 00:43:59,410
like theories.
I just know I just,

982
00:43:59,920 --> 00:44:04,920
I know that she's just been doing a 
fantastic job and she's just one of the 

983
00:44:04,920 --> 00:44:04,930
best.
I know Nikki Haley.

984
00:44:04,990 --> 00:44:06,130
Ben Shapiro.
Twenty 24.

985
00:44:06,180 --> 00:44:11,180
Yeah,
I mean I'd probably have to be press 

986
00:44:11,180 --> 00:44:11,180
secretary at that point.
Yeah,

987
00:44:11,180 --> 00:44:12,780
that would work for like one horrific 
week and then.

988
00:44:12,920 --> 00:44:13,620
No,
that'd be fine.

989
00:44:13,621 --> 00:44:15,240
I should do.
All right.

990
00:44:15,241 --> 00:44:20,241
So gimme,
Gimme some of the techniques when you 

991
00:44:20,241 --> 00:44:20,241
see that it can't just be about standing
still and,

992
00:44:20,241 --> 00:44:23,460
and facts if you're,
if you're in a conversation with a young

993
00:44:23,461 --> 00:44:25,740
person that's really just bought into 
all of this,

994
00:44:26,050 --> 00:44:27,610
what are some of the techniques you 
used?

995
00:44:28,110 --> 00:44:30,610
Have you been successful?
I suspect that you sometimes.

996
00:44:30,620 --> 00:44:31,470
Yeah,
I think I have.

997
00:44:31,500 --> 00:44:31,980
The first thing you

998
00:44:31,980 --> 00:44:36,980
have to realize is that is this person 
looking cap and open discussion and 

999
00:44:37,711 --> 00:44:38,970
actually wants.
Sorry about that.

1000
00:44:39,030 --> 00:44:40,380
Talking a lot these days.
It's all right.

1001
00:44:40,381 --> 00:44:44,970
I know it's too much or,
or actually wants to develop their point

1002
00:44:44,971 --> 00:44:46,020
of view.
If they do,

1003
00:44:46,200 --> 00:44:51,200
you have to treat it with decency and 
respect and not call them an idiot or 

1004
00:44:51,200 --> 00:44:51,990
something.
You have to treat them like a,

1005
00:44:52,170 --> 00:44:54,810
like a good human being should,
um,

1006
00:44:55,020 --> 00:45:00,020
and then just have a rational 
conversation with them and see where 

1007
00:45:00,020 --> 00:45:02,901
they're coming from.
A and a lot of times I can immediately 

1008
00:45:02,901 --> 00:45:04,650
know what they're going to respond to me
like just straight off the bat,

1009
00:45:04,651 --> 00:45:06,570
I know what they're gonna respond to me 
and I hit them with,

1010
00:45:06,690 --> 00:45:08,130
with an initial,
here's what you're gonna say,

1011
00:45:08,131 --> 00:45:10,170
here's the reason.
And they're just shocked.

1012
00:45:11,160 --> 00:45:12,850
But then do you get them around?
I mean do,

1013
00:45:12,880 --> 00:45:16,230
do you find because it really,
it's like sort of deprogramming somebody

1014
00:45:16,231 --> 00:45:18,300
out of this and I've had some success at
it.

1015
00:45:18,300 --> 00:45:23,300
Right.
And a lot of them have watched my show 

1016
00:45:23,300 --> 00:45:23,300
now.
So yeah,

1017
00:45:23,300 --> 00:45:26,391
I mean when I first heard speaking out,
kids would come up to me in school and 

1018
00:45:26,391 --> 00:45:26,391
two things they would say it'd be like,
Kyla,

1019
00:45:26,391 --> 00:45:27,470
I'm a conservative.
So,

1020
00:45:27,500 --> 00:45:28,770
so the thing about school is really 
interesting.

1021
00:45:28,920 --> 00:45:33,920
I wouldn't get stare downs and like 
people would like try to beat me up so 

1022
00:45:33,920 --> 00:45:33,920
people would like send me like,
hey kyle,

1023
00:45:33,920 --> 00:45:35,580
watch out.
So and so trying to beat you up.

1024
00:45:35,940 --> 00:45:36,630
I was like,
all right man,

1025
00:45:36,660 --> 00:45:37,370
go for it.
Okay.

1026
00:45:37,970 --> 00:45:39,870
Um,
and people would give me stare downs and

1027
00:45:39,871 --> 00:45:44,871
there was such villainization of being 
conservative being second amendment 

1028
00:45:44,871 --> 00:45:48,501
supporter.
When I spoke up I kind of opened the 

1029
00:45:48,501 --> 00:45:48,501
crack for people to say,
Oh,

1030
00:45:48,501 --> 00:45:52,101
I agree with him.
People would walk up to me and like 

1031
00:45:52,101 --> 00:45:52,101
caught up like,
Kyle,

1032
00:45:52,101 --> 00:45:52,101
thank you so much for doing.

1033
00:45:52,101 --> 00:45:54,750
I'm just scared to speak out.
And in addition people say,

1034
00:45:55,050 --> 00:46:00,050
Kyle,
I thought I was pro gun control and you 

1035
00:46:00,050 --> 00:46:02,601
spoke and I listened to you and then I 
did some more research and I agree with 

1036
00:46:02,601 --> 00:46:02,700
you.
So that was great to see it.

1037
00:46:02,701 --> 00:46:04,580
And like that's just,
that's all I'm here for.

1038
00:46:04,670 --> 00:46:08,340
So to have people,
you know,

1039
00:46:08,490 --> 00:46:11,070
understand conservatism and understand 
the second amendment,

1040
00:46:11,910 --> 00:46:14,430
it's got to be pretty weird that you 
guys are still in high school,

1041
00:46:14,431 --> 00:46:19,431
right?
Like now you're your celebrities in the 

1042
00:46:19,431 --> 00:46:21,681
most strange sense of celebrity you are 
and your role still in high school 

1043
00:46:21,681 --> 00:46:23,640
together.
What is that like?

1044
00:46:23,730 --> 00:46:28,730
I mean,
at the end of the day we have to 

1045
00:46:28,730 --> 00:46:29,460
remember that we're kids and I will 
explain it to you guys.

1046
00:46:29,461 --> 00:46:31,120
Don't think I'm hypocritical.
Um,

1047
00:46:31,650 --> 00:46:36,650
when you're on TV and you're spouting 
politics during adult but in your 

1048
00:46:36,650 --> 00:46:38,820
private life you were a kid and we 
cannot forget that.

1049
00:46:39,060 --> 00:46:40,470
So let's say,
you know,

1050
00:46:40,471 --> 00:46:45,471
when someone,
some kid on the left does something 

1051
00:46:45,471 --> 00:46:46,230
stupid.
It's at the end day,

1052
00:46:46,231 --> 00:46:48,360
they're a kid and we have to address it 
as such,

1053
00:46:48,870 --> 00:46:50,850
um,
but,

1054
00:46:50,851 --> 00:46:55,851
but it's,
it's been a crazy world when and I 

1055
00:46:55,851 --> 00:46:58,311
think,
thank God I found a solid group of 

1056
00:46:58,311 --> 00:46:58,311
people who want the best for me that I 
can reach out,

1057
00:46:58,311 --> 00:46:58,920
you know,
just not for policy,

1058
00:46:58,921 --> 00:47:01,190
but it's also like personal advice.
Like I,

1059
00:47:01,191 --> 00:47:01,720
I,
uh,

1060
00:47:03,090 --> 00:47:04,230
I asked Ben,
Hey,

1061
00:47:04,231 --> 00:47:06,930
how do you think I should approach 
college apps and some conservative,

1062
00:47:07,400 --> 00:47:09,820
you know,
and he helped me out and it's just,

1063
00:47:09,870 --> 00:47:14,340
it's so great to be able to reach out to
people and have them,

1064
00:47:14,341 --> 00:47:17,850
you know,
give you advice from like 20 years older

1065
00:47:17,851 --> 00:47:21,700
than me and given me that advice that 
they had to go through the,

1066
00:47:21,840 --> 00:47:24,450
what was that great tweet?
So you're like number one in your class,

1067
00:47:24,451 --> 00:47:25,380
right?
Not like number one.

1068
00:47:25,381 --> 00:47:27,030
You are number one,
you're correct.

1069
00:47:27,031 --> 00:47:28,810
There was some tweet that you had about 
that,

1070
00:47:28,880 --> 00:47:29,820
that awesome.
Yeah.

1071
00:47:30,120 --> 00:47:30,850
What was that

1072
00:47:32,020 --> 00:47:33,180
number one?
Yeah.

1073
00:47:33,310 --> 00:47:36,460
Um,
and people got so angry,

1074
00:47:37,210 --> 00:47:39,760
so angry and they're like,
we're going to boycott graduation.

1075
00:47:39,761 --> 00:47:40,540
So I was like,
Yay.

1076
00:47:40,541 --> 00:47:43,000
More cake.
It was great.

1077
00:47:43,690 --> 00:47:44,740
It was great.
And then,

1078
00:47:44,890 --> 00:47:46,970
you know,
the next step,

1079
00:47:47,220 --> 00:47:49,660
what was the reason they wanted to 
boycott because I was number one,

1080
00:47:50,410 --> 00:47:53,670
so then the semester updated and then I 
was still number one.

1081
00:47:53,700 --> 00:47:56,560
So I posted another tweet about that and
then also blew up and I was like,

1082
00:47:56,561 --> 00:47:58,900
we're going to get Ben Shapiro to come.
Data Lash is gonna come.

1083
00:47:59,160 --> 00:48:00,940
It's gonna be fantastic.
Chris Cox was like,

1084
00:48:00,941 --> 00:48:02,590
yeah,
I'm going to be there.

1085
00:48:03,800 --> 00:48:04,760
Why would they want.
I mean,

1086
00:48:04,810 --> 00:48:09,810
is that really how sort of polarizing 
Lee crazy this has got at a high school 

1087
00:48:09,810 --> 00:48:12,430
level that just because they don't like.
I mean you're your number one not by,

1088
00:48:12,880 --> 00:48:17,880
by being more deemed.
No until your number one out of clearly 

1089
00:48:17,880 --> 00:48:18,280
a lot of hard work and smarts and all 
that.

1090
00:48:18,820 --> 00:48:22,270
You'd think that there would be certain 
respect for that in some alternative.

1091
00:48:23,460 --> 00:48:28,200
It's sad that we have,
we are no longer able to be friends with

1092
00:48:28,201 --> 00:48:33,201
people like it's sad that people on the 
left think so people on the left think 

1093
00:48:33,201 --> 00:48:37,790
that you're a Republican,
therefore you're evil and that sad that 

1094
00:48:37,790 --> 00:48:42,051
you're not allowed to be friends with 
people who have different political 

1095
00:48:42,051 --> 00:48:44,840
viewpoints and you're like,
my best friend is a liberal and I 

1096
00:48:44,840 --> 00:48:44,840
actually brought him to the turning 
point event and after it was like,

1097
00:48:44,840 --> 00:48:45,350
you know,
Kyle,

1098
00:48:45,390 --> 00:48:47,670
some awesome people.
And I was like,

1099
00:48:47,671 --> 00:48:48,330
yeah,
I told you.

1100
00:48:49,100 --> 00:48:51,060
He still liberal.
He's an old school.

1101
00:48:51,520 --> 00:48:54,540
That's cool.
These probably we're getting there.

1102
00:48:54,541 --> 00:48:55,080
You and him both.

1103
00:48:57,870 --> 00:48:58,900
All right,
so wait,

1104
00:48:58,910 --> 00:49:01,170
let's talk a little bit about college.
So you're,

1105
00:49:01,171 --> 00:49:05,180
you're doing a great job in high school.
Clearly now you've got a public profile.

1106
00:49:05,181 --> 00:49:10,181
Grades are great.
Seemingly you could get in to wherever 

1107
00:49:10,181 --> 00:49:10,340
you want to go and do it.
Yeah,

1108
00:49:10,370 --> 00:49:10,790
yeah,
yeah.

1109
00:49:10,791 --> 00:49:12,670
So do you really think that that will 
play a role in,

1110
00:49:12,671 --> 00:49:14,150
in the schools that you're able to get 
into?

1111
00:49:15,130 --> 00:49:15,970
Yeah,
absolutely.

1112
00:49:16,150 --> 00:49:17,050
It's sad to say,
but,

1113
00:49:17,140 --> 00:49:18,760
but there is a bias against 
conservative,

1114
00:49:18,761 --> 00:49:23,761
especially like the top tier schools.
Like right now I'm looking to apply to 

1115
00:49:23,761 --> 00:49:26,830
ivy's.
It'd be great to get into Harvard or 

1116
00:49:26,830 --> 00:49:27,640
Columbia.
I really think a man,

1117
00:49:27,641 --> 00:49:30,190
you'd be the reckoning of those places.
I really think it'd be awesome.

1118
00:49:30,191 --> 00:49:35,191
I really think that.
I think it's really important to be 

1119
00:49:35,191 --> 00:49:35,191
accredited.
Um,

1120
00:49:35,191 --> 00:49:35,191
you know,
I might,

1121
00:49:35,191 --> 00:49:37,420
I'm thinking about Georgetown or Gw to 
work on the hill.

1122
00:49:37,421 --> 00:49:39,400
I think that's great.
Um,

1123
00:49:39,460 --> 00:49:40,270
but yeah,
like I really,

1124
00:49:40,271 --> 00:49:45,271
I really don't know what's next for me.
I really don't go to college.

1125
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:47,380
I'm definitely going to stay with 
turning point.

1126
00:49:47,381 --> 00:49:49,600
It's a great organization.
I'm still going to be conservative.

1127
00:49:49,601 --> 00:49:52,380
Don't worry.
I'm not going to change to change.

1128
00:49:52,780 --> 00:49:54,330
People don't go the other way,
right?

1129
00:49:54,340 --> 00:49:56,140
You're not going to suddenly grow up and
be like,

1130
00:49:56,300 --> 00:49:57,000
no,
no,

1131
00:49:57,050 --> 00:49:58,270
no.
I'll go to the feelings.

1132
00:49:58,271 --> 00:49:59,460
Things that,
that usually does,

1133
00:49:59,461 --> 00:50:00,670
that won't happen.
Yeah.

1134
00:50:00,960 --> 00:50:02,050
But all right,
so you want to go to school,

1135
00:50:02,051 --> 00:50:03,940
but you.
So you really do think that your,

1136
00:50:03,970 --> 00:50:07,990
your politics could affect I guess.
Well,

1137
00:50:07,991 --> 00:50:10,660
what happened with David Hogg Right?
He didn't get into to all,

1138
00:50:10,661 --> 00:50:15,661
I don't know what his grades are,
but like he didn't get into a whole 

1139
00:50:15,661 --> 00:50:15,661
bunch of schools.
Right.

1140
00:50:15,661 --> 00:50:16,320
I mean there've been rumors that he got 
into Harvard.

1141
00:50:16,350 --> 00:50:18,720
Northeastern,
it wouldn't surprise me.

1142
00:50:20,130 --> 00:50:21,180
Yeah.
Yeah.

1143
00:50:21,560 --> 00:50:23,100
And what do you want to study?
You have any idea?

1144
00:50:23,550 --> 00:50:26,490
It's either business or law.
I really don't know yet.

1145
00:50:26,491 --> 00:50:27,770
I just,
you know,

1146
00:50:27,780 --> 00:50:32,780
I,
I've always liked business and I think 

1147
00:50:32,780 --> 00:50:33,230
law is just absolutely phenomenal.
Really don't know yet.

1148
00:50:33,590 --> 00:50:34,610
Uh,
but you know,

1149
00:50:34,620 --> 00:50:39,620
it's going to be great to be on a 
college campus where everyone is just 

1150
00:50:39,620 --> 00:50:40,190
really liberal.
That'll be fun.

1151
00:50:41,200 --> 00:50:46,200
It's sort of weird and I guess this 
shows a little bit about the way the 

1152
00:50:46,200 --> 00:50:47,710
college experience is going,
but in a bizarre way,

1153
00:50:47,711 --> 00:50:49,600
just knowing you from the little bit 
that I know you,

1154
00:50:49,601 --> 00:50:53,010
it's like in a way it's almost like you 
don't have to go to college like you.

1155
00:50:54,020 --> 00:50:55,570
Well,
I'm not saying you shouldn't and I think

1156
00:50:55,571 --> 00:50:58,630
there's all sorts of social reasons that
somebody should go and you can,

1157
00:50:58,650 --> 00:51:03,650
you know,
you learn in all sorts of other ways 

1158
00:51:03,650 --> 00:51:05,401
that aren't necessarily academic,
but it's like clearly you've got the 

1159
00:51:05,401 --> 00:51:06,040
academic thing down and can keep 
learning that way.

1160
00:51:06,400 --> 00:51:06,920
So it's,
you know,

1161
00:51:06,950 --> 00:51:09,460
it's bizarre that people spend,
you know,

1162
00:51:09,490 --> 00:51:14,490
20 grand a year to go to college when no
one thing is we're surrounded by a lot 

1163
00:51:14,861 --> 00:51:16,060
of great minds is what I'm saying.

1164
00:51:16,360 --> 00:51:21,360
I'm with you.
But the issue with colleges that you're 

1165
00:51:21,360 --> 00:51:21,360
basically paying to get,
you're so brainwashed with stupidity and

1166
00:51:21,360 --> 00:51:22,600
that's suck part because there were 
actual,

1167
00:51:22,601 --> 00:51:27,601
like great things to learn in college.
Just not like lesbian dance theory that 

1168
00:51:27,601 --> 00:51:31,471
says that a lot.
Some of these classes are just useless 

1169
00:51:31,471 --> 00:51:31,471
and you know,
and just,

1170
00:51:31,471 --> 00:51:33,970
it's just straight up complete 
stupidity.

1171
00:51:34,030 --> 00:51:35,440
A lot of the stuff that they're teaching
there.

1172
00:51:35,530 --> 00:51:40,530
So what do you make of how this seems to
be a through line through education and 

1173
00:51:42,101 --> 00:51:44,440
I mean high school education,
college education.

1174
00:51:44,441 --> 00:51:49,441
Clearly the media,
like all of this sort of brainwashing 

1175
00:51:50,140 --> 00:51:55,140
stuff that you're talking about.
It's always going against people like 

1176
00:51:55,140 --> 00:51:57,730
you and I see you on twitter,
you take down cnn all the time,

1177
00:51:57,731 --> 00:52:01,120
you take down main street all the time.
People know my thoughts on this.

1178
00:52:01,121 --> 00:52:03,350
It's like I just wish like to me,
if these,

1179
00:52:03,430 --> 00:52:08,430
we just address that twitter,
just twitter's for fond and we have to 

1180
00:52:08,430 --> 00:52:08,430
stop taking twitter,
associate your bio.

1181
00:52:08,430 --> 00:52:10,360
Your bio is perfect.
Twitter is not real life.

1182
00:52:10,420 --> 00:52:15,420
It's not real life but pete.
But the weird thing about that is it's 

1183
00:52:15,420 --> 00:52:17,920
starting to leak into real life.
I did a direct message like a year and a

1184
00:52:17,920 --> 00:52:22,920
half ago or so about how online culture 
is becoming mainstream culture and I 

1185
00:52:22,920 --> 00:52:23,320
think that that really is what's 
happening here.

1186
00:52:23,321 --> 00:52:28,321
Twitter is not real life but it's 
starting to like leak out into 

1187
00:52:28,321 --> 00:52:31,801
everyone's conversation.
So Fox News and CNN and MSNBC or 

1188
00:52:31,801 --> 00:52:32,050
basically trump's twitter,
like twitter is like,

1189
00:52:32,140 --> 00:52:37,140
you know,
like have you seen shows where they 

1190
00:52:37,140 --> 00:52:37,140
basically read random replies to 
messages.

1191
00:52:37,140 --> 00:52:37,590
It's like John Smith,
three point seven,

1192
00:52:37,630 --> 00:52:40,990
four for this like that.
So

1193
00:52:40,990 --> 00:52:45,990
stupid.
But the biggest thing that we're seeing 

1194
00:52:45,990 --> 00:52:45,990
right now is,
is a cultural shift with the youth,

1195
00:52:46,120 --> 00:52:51,120
like memes,
memes have so much power in our lives 

1196
00:52:51,120 --> 00:52:52,120
matter.
Memes,

1197
00:52:52,510 --> 00:52:57,510
one,
a lot of memes helped so much for the 

1198
00:52:57,510 --> 00:52:58,700
trumps 2016 campaign with it really did.
Um,

1199
00:52:58,780 --> 00:53:03,780
and social media has a huge influence on
our beliefs and our actions and that's 

1200
00:53:05,111 --> 00:53:10,111
why it is so scary to see censorship of 
Conservatives online because that is 

1201
00:53:10,111 --> 00:53:15,001
basically like twitter is basically the 
new version of you just like yelling 

1202
00:53:15,220 --> 00:53:20,220
into a crowd and that's basically like 
the main form of everyone's 

1203
00:53:20,220 --> 00:53:24,400
communication and shutting that down.
It's like heavily restricting,

1204
00:53:24,660 --> 00:53:29,660
you know,
I haven't developed my full opinion on 

1205
00:53:29,660 --> 00:53:31,431
this,
but it seems as such restricting this 

1206
00:53:31,431 --> 00:53:34,041
restricts your,
like really restricts your First 

1207
00:53:34,041 --> 00:53:34,041
Amendment,
right?

1208
00:53:34,041 --> 00:53:34,340
Yeah.
So this is the whole issue about whether

1209
00:53:34,341 --> 00:53:36,230
they're publishers or platforms.
Yeah.

1210
00:53:36,300 --> 00:53:38,980
Big issue.
I don't know if I'm saying this right,

1211
00:53:38,981 --> 00:53:42,210
but I think one of the things is if 
there are certain if there or if they're

1212
00:53:42,211 --> 00:53:45,400
a published further than like they have 
a lot of legal liability.

1213
00:53:45,401 --> 00:53:50,401
If they're a platform,
then every everyone should say whatever 

1214
00:53:50,401 --> 00:53:50,590
they want,
but that's not the case,

1215
00:53:50,591 --> 00:53:55,591
so just pick one and they're just 
completely censoring conservatives.

1216
00:53:57,100 --> 00:54:02,100
Like I know prager u gets like their 
videos demonetize so much and have your 

1217
00:54:02,100 --> 00:54:02,960
videos got demonetized?
They probably,

1218
00:54:03,070 --> 00:54:08,070
yeah.
Well now now it's gotten a little bit 

1219
00:54:08,070 --> 00:54:10,501
better,
but our video is just don't go out to 

1220
00:54:10,501 --> 00:54:10,501
feeds anymore.
I went on that rhythm.

1221
00:54:10,501 --> 00:54:15,000
Yeah,
that crazy rampage I went on where I 

1222
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:15,820
just started retweeting real people.
I only did it with real people with real

1223
00:54:15,821 --> 00:54:20,821
names saying they'd been unsubscribed 
and they're getting hundreds and 

1224
00:54:20,821 --> 00:54:23,850
sometimes thousands of retweets and I'm 
tagging youtube and they just ignore me 

1225
00:54:23,850 --> 00:54:24,640
and it's like,
come on guys.

1226
00:54:24,860 --> 00:54:26,550
I mean you to play the game a little 
bit.

1227
00:54:26,600 --> 00:54:30,190
Both facebook and twitter all have 
proven biases.

1228
00:54:31,180 --> 00:54:32,120
Proven.
Yeah.

1229
00:54:32,470 --> 00:54:35,560
How worried are a.
So it's really interesting to me because

1230
00:54:35,600 --> 00:54:40,600
you never.
You didn't grow up in a time when there 

1231
00:54:40,600 --> 00:54:43,831
was some sort of trustworthy,
seemingly trustworthy level of the 

1232
00:54:43,831 --> 00:54:45,670
media.
Like CNN was not always this.

1233
00:54:45,671 --> 00:54:47,560
The reason I don't even know if you know
this,

1234
00:54:47,561 --> 00:54:52,561
but the the reason I think that so many 
people like me that are older than you 

1235
00:54:52,561 --> 00:54:55,950
attack cnn the most is cassina and used 
to be decent like msnbc saying,

1236
00:54:56,111 --> 00:55:00,610
we lean left Fox and CNN saying that,
and it's like,

1237
00:55:00,611 --> 00:55:01,270
no,
you're not.

1238
00:55:01,370 --> 00:55:04,930
We know exactly what you're doing and 
that's why I always tax CNN because it's

1239
00:55:04,931 --> 00:55:06,910
like you guys have actually become the 
worst.

1240
00:55:08,200 --> 00:55:13,200
The ratings are like the lowest.
It's like a block of read CNN.

1241
00:55:13,760 --> 00:55:15,600
Yeah.
So here's what I think.

1242
00:55:16,620 --> 00:55:21,620
I think that a lot of young people and 
like an average Americans do not trust 

1243
00:55:22,291 --> 00:55:25,260
the media anymore and they have sought 
out individuals instead.

1244
00:55:25,290 --> 00:55:27,210
So they trusted individuals.
So they look to you,

1245
00:55:27,211 --> 00:55:29,490
they look to Ben,
they look to a Guy Benson,

1246
00:55:29,790 --> 00:55:34,790
Charlie Kirk for,
for their news because they trust the 

1247
00:55:34,790 --> 00:55:34,790
individual.

1248
00:55:34,790 --> 00:55:36,890
Right.
Do you see a great risk in that too?

1249
00:55:37,040 --> 00:55:38,100
Because I'm worried about that.

1250
00:55:38,140 --> 00:55:43,140
I also put.
But the thing is with that is that you 

1251
00:55:43,140 --> 00:55:43,240
have absolute liability for what you 
say.

1252
00:55:43,400 --> 00:55:46,240
You know,
CNN can whip something up or you know,

1253
00:55:46,241 --> 00:55:51,241
but when,
when an individual like tweets 

1254
00:55:51,241 --> 00:55:54,591
something,
it's on like they're responsible for 

1255
00:55:54,591 --> 00:55:54,591
their actions.

1256
00:55:54,591 --> 00:55:58,570
Yeah.
So one of the things I've been saying 

1257
00:55:58,570 --> 00:56:00,260
lately is that I'm actually in a bizarre
way less interested in politics now than

1258
00:56:00,261 --> 00:56:01,790
I've ever been,
but I'm interested in what,

1259
00:56:01,791 --> 00:56:04,400
you referenced it a little while ago,
this culture thing.

1260
00:56:04,490 --> 00:56:06,200
I mean culture,
where does it cultures,

1261
00:56:06,380 --> 00:56:08,170
politics is downstream from culture.
Yeah.

1262
00:56:08,200 --> 00:56:09,180
That's so true.
Yeah.

1263
00:56:09,200 --> 00:56:12,920
So do you see that really as a sort of 
the future of all this,

1264
00:56:12,921 --> 00:56:16,850
that it's not going to be about all of 
the little machinations of politics,

1265
00:56:16,851 --> 00:56:18,550
it's just going to be about.
I mean this,

1266
00:56:18,560 --> 00:56:20,290
I guess this is the strength of trump.
Well,

1267
00:56:20,420 --> 00:56:22,560
where you'd argue it's either the 
strength or the,

1268
00:56:22,780 --> 00:56:23,980
the worst

1269
00:56:23,980 --> 00:56:26,770
part of trump.
I suppose that's a cultural thing.

1270
00:56:26,771 --> 00:56:29,380
Not necessarily a political thing.
No,

1271
00:56:29,381 --> 00:56:32,080
I mean there,
there are pros and cons to that,

1272
00:56:32,620 --> 00:56:37,620
but we just have to play by the rules 
that are set by society and these are 

1273
00:56:37,620 --> 00:56:42,031
the rules.
These are rules that culture has a 

1274
00:56:42,031 --> 00:56:42,340
massive impact on society and whether I 
like it or not,

1275
00:56:42,341 --> 00:56:45,340
that Kanye,
Kanye speaking out.

1276
00:56:45,341 --> 00:56:46,650
First of all,
I think it's great to be speaking out to

1277
00:56:46,660 --> 00:56:51,660
the First Amendment right.
I don't think we should be propping up 

1278
00:56:51,660 --> 00:56:52,540
opinions by celebrities,
siblings,

1279
00:56:52,541 --> 00:56:57,541
because they're famous.
You have to show that you are informed 

1280
00:56:57,541 --> 00:57:00,631
on the subject and that's that.
But it doesn't take a political genius 

1281
00:57:00,631 --> 00:57:04,321
to say that I believe in our second 
amendment and our first amendment that 

1282
00:57:04,321 --> 00:57:05,440
doesn't take but Taylor swift doing like
a 7,000

1283
00:57:05,441 --> 00:57:07,480
page essay,
you know,

1284
00:57:07,630 --> 00:57:12,630
that makes absolutely no sense and 
contradicts itself written by like a 

1285
00:57:12,630 --> 00:57:12,850
liberal,
you know,

1286
00:57:13,300 --> 00:57:15,460
a worker on the hill.

1287
00:57:15,840 --> 00:57:20,840
That's what I was disappointed in that 
just because I have no particular 

1288
00:57:20,840 --> 00:57:24,441
feelings about her when I don't care.
I honestly don't think I could name one 

1289
00:57:24,441 --> 00:57:28,461
song or whatever,
but it's just like the fact that she 

1290
00:57:28,461 --> 00:57:28,461
stayed out of politics.
I liked,

1291
00:57:28,461 --> 00:57:28,461
I was like,
oh,

1292
00:57:28,620 --> 00:57:31,800
whatever she's doing or whatever.
Her handlers are saying to her,

1293
00:57:31,801 --> 00:57:36,801
I kinda like it.
And then she got in on this and it's 

1294
00:57:36,801 --> 00:57:39,291
like,
I don't care which way she was going to 

1295
00:57:39,291 --> 00:57:39,291
break.
I was just like,

1296
00:57:39,291 --> 00:57:39,291
ah,
this is not what we need.

1297
00:57:39,291 --> 00:57:39,291
Yeah,
I mean,

1298
00:57:39,380 --> 00:57:43,420
Taylor swift effect president is like 
down Marsha Blackburn love.

1299
00:57:43,520 --> 00:57:45,540
So thanks Taylor swift.
No,

1300
00:57:45,590 --> 00:57:48,980
but,
but what we saw right now by the left is

1301
00:57:48,981 --> 00:57:53,981
that they are losing their stranglehold 
on culture and that is very frightening 

1302
00:57:53,981 --> 00:57:58,601
for them.
And we saw that with Connie and Connie 

1303
00:57:58,601 --> 00:58:01,031
started speaking out.
I gave my speech about this and they 

1304
00:58:01,031 --> 00:58:02,090
started off with mob tactics that didn't
work.

1305
00:58:02,530 --> 00:58:03,890
Uh,
emotional appeal.

1306
00:58:03,920 --> 00:58:05,740
The TMZ guy was basically begging him 
like,

1307
00:58:05,750 --> 00:58:06,980
Kanye,
please men take,

1308
00:58:06,981 --> 00:58:08,060
take off your hat,
man.

1309
00:58:08,061 --> 00:58:09,830
It hurts me emotionally.
It was like,

1310
00:58:09,831 --> 00:58:10,710
no,
it's my first semester.

1311
00:58:10,730 --> 00:58:14,630
I'm not taking it off.
And then we saw just blatant racism,

1312
00:58:15,650 --> 00:58:19,420
viola character,
assassinations and disgusting.

1313
00:58:19,440 --> 00:58:20,900
You wouldn't know that.
That is.

1314
00:58:20,960 --> 00:58:23,510
How does that fly?
He wouldn't bow down to the mob.

1315
00:58:23,780 --> 00:58:26,160
Absolutely wouldn't be,
but no,

1316
00:58:26,270 --> 00:58:28,160
they're losing their stranglehold on 
culture.

1317
00:58:28,760 --> 00:58:33,590
And whether I like that we are putting 
so much emphasis on cultural icon.

1318
00:58:34,520 --> 00:58:37,550
Those are the rules.
The rules say that on twitter,

1319
00:58:37,551 --> 00:58:41,330
a lot of rules,
but this is,

1320
00:58:41,331 --> 00:58:43,400
this is,
this is the reality that we're living in

1321
00:58:43,490 --> 00:58:48,490
and we have to understand that and 
what's happening with Kanye is a real 

1322
00:58:49,880 --> 00:58:54,880
shift,
especially for African Americans and 

1323
00:58:54,880 --> 00:58:55,520
people who were like in Little Tinos.
They're basically saying,

1324
00:58:56,630 --> 00:58:59,720
I don't know why this controversial.
Blackstone have to be Democrats.

1325
00:58:59,750 --> 00:59:00,760
You don't own me.
That's all.

1326
00:59:01,060 --> 00:59:03,870
Basically,
it's all he sang and he has created such

1327
00:59:03,980 --> 00:59:07,830
like a pivotal moment that says,
you're,

1328
00:59:07,940 --> 00:59:12,940
you don't,
you're stranglehold doesn't affect me 

1329
00:59:12,940 --> 00:59:12,940
because I know in Hollywood,
like the second you say something like,

1330
00:59:12,940 --> 00:59:14,330
I remember someone said,
Ben Shapiro is a nice guy.

1331
00:59:14,420 --> 00:59:15,520
His career was destroyed.

1332
00:59:15,780 --> 00:59:16,620
Yeah.
Mark Duplass,

1333
00:59:16,621 --> 00:59:19,680
who's a friend of mine who's been on 
this show and he had to issue an apology

1334
00:59:19,681 --> 00:59:21,290
and it's like,
you know,

1335
00:59:21,291 --> 00:59:23,330
oddly.
Whereas the ID people,

1336
00:59:23,390 --> 00:59:26,060
people came to his defense at first 
basically saying,

1337
00:59:26,420 --> 00:59:27,710
you know,
you should be allowed to say that.

1338
00:59:27,720 --> 00:59:32,720
Yeah.
And then unfortunately he issued and 

1339
00:59:32,720 --> 00:59:32,720
black,
especially young blacks are saying,

1340
00:59:32,720 --> 00:59:36,951
look,
they look up to Kanye west and the 

1341
00:59:36,951 --> 00:59:37,890
millions look up to him and they say,
this individual,

1342
00:59:38,940 --> 00:59:43,940
why does this individual think this way?
And even more so he didn't bow down to 

1343
00:59:43,940 --> 00:59:45,120
the mob,
which is fantastic.

1344
00:59:45,630 --> 00:59:49,210
And we're seeing a real shift.
I don't know the 38 percent number.

1345
00:59:49,211 --> 00:59:51,150
We're 38 percent African American 
approval over trump.

1346
00:59:51,151 --> 00:59:56,151
I don't know if that's necessarily true.
All I know is that there was a three 

1347
00:59:56,151 --> 00:59:58,581
percent jump from there was in August.
The black approval rating of trump was 

1348
00:59:58,581 --> 00:59:59,460
three percent.
One of the last latest polls that I know

1349
01:00:00,180 --> 01:00:03,960
month or so ago was 10 percent.
So there's a big jump in,

1350
01:00:03,980 --> 01:00:08,980
you know,
we're seeing that so many young African 

1351
01:00:08,980 --> 01:00:11,420
Americans are so energized.
Like I know turning point is doing a 

1352
01:00:11,420 --> 01:00:12,090
black leadership summit like a week in 
the White House.

1353
01:00:12,900 --> 01:00:17,900
We're going to get just 400 African 
American young individuals to be able to

1354
01:00:18,151 --> 01:00:23,151
speak their since table listen.
And to see that the left is losing their

1355
01:00:23,350 --> 01:00:27,240
stranglehold on culture.
And it is scary for them because that is

1356
01:00:27,241 --> 01:00:29,910
the one thing that they have left.
All right,

1357
01:00:29,911 --> 01:00:31,800
I got two more for you.
All right.

1358
01:00:31,980 --> 01:00:33,450
You are you in the prediction game at 
all?

1359
01:00:33,451 --> 01:00:35,040
What do you think's going to happen in 
these midterms?

1360
01:00:35,041 --> 01:00:40,041
We've got coming up.
So what I've been hearing is that 

1361
01:00:40,140 --> 01:00:42,480
Republicans or lose it in the house and 
gain in the Senate.

1362
01:00:43,130 --> 01:00:44,950
Uh,
I love how your work has,

1363
01:00:44,951 --> 01:00:46,380
is that we're going to win back the 
executive.

1364
01:00:46,381 --> 01:00:51,381
These midterms are confused about but 
looks the cabinet effect is real.

1365
01:00:55,150 --> 01:00:58,200
Like this was like the,
all the left had to do was sit down,

1366
01:00:58,201 --> 01:00:59,940
be quiet,
be civil plaintiffs to like,

1367
01:00:59,950 --> 01:01:01,050
no,
no,

1368
01:01:01,140 --> 01:01:02,340
this is,
we're not going to allow this.

1369
01:01:02,340 --> 01:01:04,020
Okay.
And they hit themselves in the foot with

1370
01:01:04,021 --> 01:01:07,520
the club and then there started crying.
And then the same thing with Kanye.

1371
01:01:07,600 --> 01:01:12,600
That was great.
So the cabinet really amped up and 

1372
01:01:12,600 --> 01:01:16,770
energized the conservative base and even
more so it finally gave the conservative

1373
01:01:16,800 --> 01:01:19,210
like the conservatives a backbone,
like Lindsey Graham,

1374
01:01:19,350 --> 01:01:20,190
Lindsey Graham.
Two point.

1375
01:01:20,191 --> 01:01:21,730
Oh.
Or is this skype in?

1376
01:01:22,230 --> 01:01:24,030
I love it.
And like bill cassidy.

1377
01:01:24,050 --> 01:01:29,050
But,
but here's the peers of the interesting 

1378
01:01:29,050 --> 01:01:30,711
thing.
Women were the most angered by all of 

1379
01:01:30,781 --> 01:01:33,060
this.
Before the cabinet in August,

1380
01:01:33,061 --> 01:01:38,061
it was like a 35 point seven percent 
approval of trump after it was a 40 

1381
01:01:38,061 --> 01:01:40,731
point seven.
And then in August I'm the Democrats at 

1382
01:01:40,731 --> 01:01:43,530
a 12 point lead over republicans in a 
voter doozy.

1383
01:01:43,531 --> 01:01:45,810
Asm.
Now it's 64 percent republican,

1384
01:01:45,811 --> 01:01:50,811
65 Democrats.
So we are neck and neck and they said 

1385
01:01:50,811 --> 01:01:50,811
it's all thanks to the Democrat.

1386
01:01:50,811 --> 01:01:51,080
Yeah,
I mean my gut.

1387
01:01:51,140 --> 01:01:52,940
As long as you're doing predictions 
here,

1388
01:01:53,270 --> 01:01:58,270
I actually think the Republicans that 
are do well in both the house and the 

1389
01:01:58,270 --> 01:01:58,270
Senate.
I really hope so.

1390
01:01:58,270 --> 01:02:03,010
But I do think so because I agree.
I think this mob mentality and watching 

1391
01:02:03,010 --> 01:02:06,551
these videos of Antifa and Portland and 
Hillary saying we can't be civil and 

1392
01:02:06,551 --> 01:02:10,040
Eric holder saying below them and it's 
like,

1393
01:02:10,100 --> 01:02:15,100
man,
if you stand for due process and civil 

1394
01:02:15,100 --> 01:02:17,960
society and all of those things,
that thing needs to burn it.

1395
01:02:18,020 --> 01:02:20,160
It kind of sucks.
But it's like that.

1396
01:02:20,190 --> 01:02:21,570
That set of ideas

1397
01:02:22,930 --> 01:02:27,520
thinks the left just completely 
disregards the constitution.

1398
01:02:27,760 --> 01:02:31,060
The constitution was written and in the 
amendment,

1399
01:02:31,061 --> 01:02:36,061
Bill of rights was forced by anti 
federalists to make sure that the 

1400
01:02:36,061 --> 01:02:36,460
government cannot become tyrannical and 
abuse its power,

1401
01:02:36,730 --> 01:02:41,730
and this is so important.
It's protecting the rights of the 

1402
01:02:41,730 --> 01:02:41,730
individuals in these rights.
Why?

1403
01:02:41,730 --> 01:02:45,310
Why do we not all agree on them?
Why is it wrong to believe nude process?

1404
01:02:45,311 --> 01:02:50,311
Why is it wrong to say,
I believe that individuals should have 

1405
01:02:50,311 --> 01:02:52,480
the right to defend themselves and also 
defend against the tyranny of a possible

1406
01:02:52,481 --> 01:02:52,900
government.
Look,

1407
01:02:52,901 --> 01:02:57,901
second man was basically Britain because
the founders had just fought against 

1408
01:02:57,901 --> 01:02:58,860
Great Britain and they had seen how a 
turntable government quickly become.

1409
01:02:58,861 --> 01:03:03,861
So one more thing I didn't know.
The first thing tyrannical government 

1410
01:03:03,861 --> 01:03:03,861
stay was they take away the weapons of 
the civilians.

1411
01:03:03,861 --> 01:03:05,770
So it's Nazi Germany.
We saw this in China,

1412
01:03:05,771 --> 01:03:08,080
we saw this in in Cambodia.
That's the first thing they do,

1413
01:03:08,800 --> 01:03:13,800
and the individual right to bear arms is
every individual is not related to the 

1414
01:03:13,800 --> 01:03:18,241
militia clause.
So it's basically saying every 

1415
01:03:18,241 --> 01:03:18,860
individual has the right to protect 
themselves and even more so it's.

1416
01:03:18,900 --> 01:03:22,330
It's necessary for the protection of a 
free state.

1417
01:03:23,430 --> 01:03:24,670
All right,
one more for you.

1418
01:03:24,700 --> 01:03:29,700
Hit me with you.
Don't play video games as much because 

1419
01:03:29,700 --> 01:03:29,700
you don't have time.
What do you do for fun,

1420
01:03:29,700 --> 01:03:30,010
man?
What's fun?

1421
01:03:31,090 --> 01:03:32,170
I used to sites.
Twitter.

1422
01:03:32,171 --> 01:03:34,270
You can't just tell me twitter.
I know you have to put it on twitter but

1423
01:03:34,271 --> 01:03:35,770
it can't just be twitter.
What are you doing for fun?

1424
01:03:35,800 --> 01:03:38,500
So with me,
I used to play a lot of video games.

1425
01:03:38,620 --> 01:03:40,030
What kind of games?
So here's,

1426
01:03:40,031 --> 01:03:41,530
here's my progression.
I haven't said this,

1427
01:03:41,531 --> 01:03:44,290
but this is like a scoop tanks.
Okay.

1428
01:03:44,740 --> 01:03:48,850
Advent moved to to,
to a rocket league.

1429
01:03:48,910 --> 01:03:49,670
Okay.
It's sockets.

1430
01:03:49,690 --> 01:03:50,680
Terrible game.
It's boring.

1431
01:03:50,920 --> 01:03:53,620
Then it moved to,
I played overwatch Paladins.

1432
01:03:53,621 --> 01:03:55,720
I played pub g and I played for night 
and four nine.

1433
01:03:55,780 --> 01:04:00,190
This was when the shooting occurred and 
I just stopped dead in my tracks because

1434
01:04:00,191 --> 01:04:05,191
it was just,
it's a waste of time and I see my 

1435
01:04:05,191 --> 01:04:07,861
younger brothers who were addicted to 
the game and it's just sad to see that 

1436
01:04:07,871 --> 01:04:11,170
this is the state of our youth,
that they're just completely addicted to

1437
01:04:11,200 --> 01:04:11,860
technology.
Like,

1438
01:04:11,861 --> 01:04:14,070
I'm sure if I have kids.
Okay.

1439
01:04:14,230 --> 01:04:15,820
They're not saying a phone till they're 
12.

1440
01:04:15,990 --> 01:04:18,190
You didn't ever.
They do call me or nine slash 11.

1441
01:04:19,140 --> 01:04:21,430
No video games or reading a book.
I don't care.

1442
01:04:21,830 --> 01:04:24,950
So what do you do for fun?
You just told me what you used to do.

1443
01:04:25,430 --> 01:04:26,810
Come on.
You must be having fun somewhere.

1444
01:04:26,811 --> 01:04:31,811
You're having fun sometimes.
Wow.

1445
01:04:32,111 --> 01:04:34,040
I got you.
Yeah man did you're,

1446
01:04:34,180 --> 01:04:36,570
you are having fun with this.
I have some of them,

1447
01:04:36,750 --> 01:04:36,970
um,
of the

1448
01:04:37,290 --> 01:04:41,550
remaining friends that I have which are 
really solid friends on weekends we hang

1449
01:04:41,551 --> 01:04:44,340
out,
we go watch movies and stuff like that.

1450
01:04:44,430 --> 01:04:44,930
In addition,
I,

1451
01:04:44,931 --> 01:04:49,931
I just think it's great.
One of the greatest things for me for 

1452
01:04:49,931 --> 01:04:50,070
having funders,
just simply talking to like minded kids,

1453
01:04:50,071 --> 01:04:55,071
like young individuals at these turning 
point events that we run and it's great 

1454
01:04:55,071 --> 01:04:56,910
and like meeting with pushing policy and
stuff like that.

1455
01:04:56,911 --> 01:05:01,911
It's just fantastic.
One of the greatest feelings ever was 

1456
01:05:01,911 --> 01:05:02,820
like passing the Stop School Violence 
Act and fixing nick's like the stops go.

1457
01:05:02,830 --> 01:05:06,060
Ransack appropriated funds 
$2,000,000,000

1458
01:05:06,061 --> 01:05:09,540
in funds for the production of schools 
like hardening schools,

1459
01:05:09,541 --> 01:05:14,541
metal detectors.
I'm making better communication between 

1460
01:05:14,541 --> 01:05:14,541
law enforcement,
training,

1461
01:05:14,541 --> 01:05:14,880
law enforcement teachers and students.
In addition,

1462
01:05:14,881 --> 01:05:19,881
there was a clause that said none of 
this money will be used for firearm or 

1463
01:05:19,881 --> 01:05:22,951
firearm trainings.
So this was like the greatest win for 

1464
01:05:22,951 --> 01:05:25,750
the left and they still hated the bill 
and like the march for life,

1465
01:05:25,751 --> 01:05:26,500
kids hated it.

1466
01:05:27,280 --> 01:05:32,280
But no,
I mean I'm really dead set on making 

1467
01:05:32,280 --> 01:05:32,280
sure that school shootings are a thing 
of the past.

1468
01:05:32,280 --> 01:05:33,830
They never happened again.
Uh,

1469
01:05:34,070 --> 01:05:38,680
and you love what you do and just like,
just learning about the second amendment

1470
01:05:38,980 --> 01:05:41,860
and just like being more knowledgeable 
and having these debates and discussions

1471
01:05:41,890 --> 01:05:44,100
are just like they really make my day.
Well,

1472
01:05:44,110 --> 01:05:45,510
I think it goes without saying.
I mean,

1473
01:05:45,520 --> 01:05:48,070
I think you have an absurdly bright 
future.

1474
01:05:48,120 --> 01:05:53,120
Thank you.
You're going to run for president or 

1475
01:05:53,120 --> 01:05:53,120
something?
Probably not for,

1476
01:05:53,270 --> 01:05:55,380
but you left a little window.
No,

1477
01:05:55,390 --> 01:05:57,030
I mean,
I literally do navy.

1478
01:05:57,040 --> 01:05:58,110
There's a thing,
um,

1479
01:05:58,240 --> 01:06:00,760
for politics and like the hill in the 
future.

1480
01:06:01,180 --> 01:06:03,640
Right now I'm just dead set on going to 
college,

1481
01:06:03,790 --> 01:06:05,020
getting my degree,
learning,

1482
01:06:05,420 --> 01:06:07,720
staying the political sphere.
But uh,

1483
01:06:07,750 --> 01:06:08,590
you know,
who knows,

1484
01:06:09,220 --> 01:06:11,440
I'm definitely supporting Nikki.
Haley's Shapiro Twenty 24.

1485
01:06:11,840 --> 01:06:16,840
All right.
You see people there is hope for the 

1486
01:06:16,840 --> 01:06:16,840
future.
