1
00:00:02,640 --> 00:00:03,473
  

2
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:08,150
They say history repeats itself.
I'm a big believer in this theory,

3
00:00:08,151 --> 00:00:08,984
which is why I try to spend more time on
the show talking about big ideas and 

4
00:00:11,751 --> 00:00:15,590
political philosophies rather than day 
to day political rumblings.

5
00:00:15,860 --> 00:00:16,693
Most of our political debates and media 
coverage has devolved into catchy 

6
00:00:19,911 --> 00:00:20,744
soundbites and zingers usually stage 
around some sort of publicity stunt 

7
00:00:24,260 --> 00:00:25,093
instead of true substantive debate.
Even protesting these days seems to be 

8
00:00:28,971 --> 00:00:32,930
more about screaming and hashtagging 
then making a coherent argument.

9
00:00:33,260 --> 00:00:34,093
Just think back to the election itself.
Did the candidates in the media spend 

10
00:00:36,561 --> 00:00:39,440
more time on the issues or more time on 
the circus?

11
00:00:39,770 --> 00:00:40,603
I think the answer is pretty obvious.
Understanding political philosophies 

12
00:00:43,791 --> 00:00:44,624
helps to guide us through the endless 
noise that comes out of our political 

13
00:00:47,361 --> 00:00:48,194
machine.
This is why I've tried to talk about 

14
00:00:49,581 --> 00:00:50,414
issues like gay marriage in a context 
which shows you can be liberal and for 

15
00:00:53,931 --> 00:00:57,260
gay marriage because you want gay people
to be treated equally under the law.

16
00:00:57,500 --> 00:00:58,333
Or you can be libertarian in for gay 
marriage because you don't want the 

17
00:01:00,951 --> 00:01:04,550
government involved in a contract 
between two consenting adults.

18
00:01:04,880 --> 00:01:05,713
If you understand the philosophic 
underpinnings of liberalism and 

19
00:01:08,571 --> 00:01:10,220
libertarianism,
in this case,

20
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:11,353
it can bring you to the exact same 
conclusion without understanding 

21
00:01:14,481 --> 00:01:17,840
political philosophy,
your thoughts on any day to day issue,

22
00:01:17,841 --> 00:01:18,674
we'll be guided more by your feelings.
Then by fax we see plenty of feelings 

23
00:01:22,731 --> 00:01:25,190
over facts in our public discourse these
days,

24
00:01:25,191 --> 00:01:27,710
and it's partly why we're so divided as 
a nation.

25
00:01:28,100 --> 00:01:28,933
By the way,
that isn't to say that feelings don't 

26
00:01:30,021 --> 00:01:33,200
matter at all because we are humans and 
of course they do,

27
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:37,730
but the way we're governed has to be 
based on what is empirically true,

28
00:01:38,030 --> 00:01:38,863
not just what makes us feel good.
Beyond just knowing political 

29
00:01:41,631 --> 00:01:42,464
philosophies.
Knowing history is an incredibly 

30
00:01:44,421 --> 00:01:48,110
important part of having a well rounded 
understanding of how the world works.

31
00:01:48,410 --> 00:01:49,243
Think of how many people you talk to who
claim to know everything about what tax 

32
00:01:52,221 --> 00:01:53,054
system is right,
or what foreign policy is best next 

33
00:01:55,731 --> 00:01:57,080
time.
Ask them something like,

34
00:01:57,081 --> 00:01:57,914
so tell me the reasons that the flat tax
is wrong or remind me of the history of 

35
00:02:01,761 --> 00:02:03,380
the Middle East.
During the Ottoman Empire.

36
00:02:03,890 --> 00:02:04,723
Everyone on television seems to have the
need to pretend they know everything 

37
00:02:08,211 --> 00:02:09,044
about everything.
These are the very people you have to 

38
00:02:11,001 --> 00:02:15,140
watch out for the most.
If history does repeat itself,

39
00:02:15,141 --> 00:02:18,290
I'm not exactly sure what it's repeating
right now and no,

40
00:02:18,291 --> 00:02:19,124
I don't think we're repeating Nazi 
Germany even though it's very trendy to 

41
00:02:21,801 --> 00:02:22,634
say that these days,
we truly are at a unique crossroads in 

42
00:02:25,821 --> 00:02:29,120
American politics,
which is why I can't directly compare it

43
00:02:29,300 --> 00:02:30,133
to any other time.
It's not just that America has two 

44
00:02:32,661 --> 00:02:36,440
diametrically opposed political parties 
that are caught between the left and the

45
00:02:36,441 --> 00:02:37,274
right.

46
00:02:37,340 --> 00:02:39,050
Now with Donald Trump in the White 
House,

47
00:02:39,051 --> 00:02:39,884
we have a presidential wildcard who has 
turned political alignments on their 

48
00:02:43,491 --> 00:02:44,810
head.
For example.

49
00:02:44,811 --> 00:02:45,644
Democrats are now suddenly suddenly 
arguing for states' rights because they 

50
00:02:49,491 --> 00:02:54,380
don't like all the federal power trump 
has with his series of executive orders.

51
00:02:54,740 --> 00:02:58,340
This political chaos is also pushing 
massive amounts of people,

52
00:02:58,341 --> 00:03:02,470
sick of the extremes on both sides into 
some sort of a morphis middle.

53
00:03:02,860 --> 00:03:05,680
There doesn't seem to be a political 
leader for this new center,

54
00:03:05,681 --> 00:03:08,080
nor anyone in the mainstream talking 
about it yet,

55
00:03:08,230 --> 00:03:09,880
but mark my words,
it's here.

56
00:03:10,180 --> 00:03:11,013
The key to this new center is success 
will be who sees it first and who turns 

57
00:03:14,471 --> 00:03:15,304
it into a political movement.
Whether that means a new party or 

58
00:03:17,741 --> 00:03:21,430
reforming one of the two existing major 
parties or something else all together.

59
00:03:21,700 --> 00:03:25,870
While that remains to be seen on top of 
this new political alignment,

60
00:03:26,140 --> 00:03:29,440
we also have access to information like 
never before.

61
00:03:29,710 --> 00:03:33,400
As I talk about all the time,
we all walk around with the world in our

62
00:03:33,401 --> 00:03:34,234
pockets right now.
You can connect with someone across the 

63
00:03:36,461 --> 00:03:40,210
globe just as easily as with someone 
across the street.

64
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:41,433
The genius empower of the Internet's 
ability to change our physical world 

65
00:03:44,861 --> 00:03:45,694
cannot be overstated.
This connectivity has started 

66
00:03:47,951 --> 00:03:48,784
revolutions in the Middle East and shine
light on the inner workings of our 

67
00:03:52,061 --> 00:03:54,880
government via Wiki leaks,
but at the same time,

68
00:03:54,881 --> 00:03:58,570
so much of the information is not just 
noise alone,

69
00:03:58,571 --> 00:03:59,404
but noise intended to deflect,
confused and upset you made by people 

70
00:04:03,701 --> 00:04:06,190
who want to profit off you or outright 
control you.

71
00:04:07,180 --> 00:04:08,013
Of course,
if our mainstream media had done their 

72
00:04:09,431 --> 00:04:10,264
job for the past eight years,
which is to be the guardian of truth in 

73
00:04:13,121 --> 00:04:17,650
our society than maybe the importance of
the Internet wouldn't be so vital to our

74
00:04:17,651 --> 00:04:21,250
functioning democracy in 2017 
unfortunately,

75
00:04:21,251 --> 00:04:25,540
cable and network news dropped the ball 
at almost every corner and here we are.

76
00:04:26,050 --> 00:04:28,960
They cozy to the power instead of 
keeping it in check,

77
00:04:28,961 --> 00:04:29,794
they colluded with the people they were 
supposed to keep watch over and they 

78
00:04:32,141 --> 00:04:36,460
partied with the very politicians that 
they were supposed to be reporting on.

79
00:04:37,300 --> 00:04:38,133
Now suddenly the mainstream media is 
trying to get its Mojo back by being 

80
00:04:41,291 --> 00:04:42,124
hard on trump,
but I would argue that it's basically 

81
00:04:43,691 --> 00:04:45,520
too late to do that.
Actually.

82
00:04:45,521 --> 00:04:49,270
It's kind of sad seeing them flail 
around knowing that less and less people

83
00:04:49,271 --> 00:04:50,104
are paying attention to them.
Even right now there's talk that they 

84
00:04:52,451 --> 00:04:56,110
are going to cancel the White House 
correspondence dinner because so many in

85
00:04:56,111 --> 00:04:56,944
the media dislike trump.
Think how actually insane that is when 

86
00:04:59,741 --> 00:05:00,574
they like the president,
they can party with them and drank with 

87
00:05:02,411 --> 00:05:03,850
them.
Now that they don't,

88
00:05:04,060 --> 00:05:04,893
well the Jig is up.
Maybe we needed them to guard the guy 

89
00:05:07,481 --> 00:05:09,940
they liked as much as the guy that they 
don't like.

90
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:11,193
At the same time,
we more and more catered the news to 

91
00:05:13,481 --> 00:05:16,030
ourselves.
We don't listen to pundits.

92
00:05:16,031 --> 00:05:16,864
We don't like.
We impugn the motives of anyone we 

93
00:05:18,821 --> 00:05:19,654
disagree with and we block friends and 
family who dare have different opinions 

94
00:05:22,481 --> 00:05:23,314
than us.
All of this is exactly why we need to 

95
00:05:25,571 --> 00:05:29,080
know history and philosophy more now 
than ever.

96
00:05:29,110 --> 00:05:32,620
We need to understand where we came from
so we can know where we're going.

97
00:05:32,980 --> 00:05:37,120
We need to know why the founding fathers
wrote the constitution the way they did.

98
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:38,193
We need to understand why they yearn for
freedom and liberty in a way that seems 

99
00:05:41,801 --> 00:05:42,634
almost archaic to us now,
but it's possibly the most important 

100
00:05:45,401 --> 00:05:48,820
lesson we could learn this year.
With all this in mind,

101
00:05:48,821 --> 00:05:52,000
I can't think of a better guest for this
week as we continue our partnership with

102
00:05:52,001 --> 00:05:56,200
the fine folks over at learn liberty.
Dan Carlin is a radio and TV personality

103
00:05:56,201 --> 00:05:58,100
who hosts two incredibly successful

104
00:05:58,100 --> 00:06:01,160
podcasts,
common sense and hardcore history.

105
00:06:01,430 --> 00:06:02,263
As a self described political Martian,
Dan uses thought experiments to try to 

106
00:06:06,411 --> 00:06:09,380
make some sense of the modern world on 
his podcast.

107
00:06:09,381 --> 00:06:11,050
Hardcore history.
He hosts long,

108
00:06:11,060 --> 00:06:15,680
well thought out presentations of 
historical events set to the backdrop of

109
00:06:15,681 --> 00:06:16,514
how we might view these events through a
current day lens while he is in 

110
00:06:19,641 --> 00:06:20,474
technically a historian,
he's proven himself to be incredibly 

111
00:06:23,421 --> 00:06:24,254
adept at storytelling history in a way 
that offers some modern day answers to 

112
00:06:28,341 --> 00:06:31,460
historical events.
If history repeats itself,

113
00:06:31,490 --> 00:06:32,323
then let's make the next repeat a little
more enlightened and perhaps a little 

114
00:06:35,541 --> 00:06:37,970
less painful than the last time around.

115
00:06:42,890 --> 00:06:43,180
Okay.

116
00:06:43,180 --> 00:06:45,910
We're continuing our partnership with 
learn liberty this week.

117
00:06:45,911 --> 00:06:50,911
And joining me is a TV and radio 
journalist host of two hugely successful

118
00:06:51,401 --> 00:06:54,220
podcasts,
common sense and hardcore history,

119
00:06:54,460 --> 00:06:58,270
and a self-described political Martian.
Dan Carlin,

120
00:06:58,271 --> 00:06:59,104
welcome to the Rubin report.
Thank you for having me on political 

121
00:07:01,181 --> 00:07:03,070
Martian.
I love this phrase.

122
00:07:03,130 --> 00:07:03,963
I understand why you use this phrase,
but tell the people who don't know what 

123
00:07:07,931 --> 00:07:10,270
a political Martian is.
What is it?

124
00:07:10,690 --> 00:07:11,523
It came from not being able to have a 
good easy description when people ask 

125
00:07:14,921 --> 00:07:15,754
you your political views.
I'm really jealous of the people that 

126
00:07:17,231 --> 00:07:19,210
can throw a word out there.
And everybody goes,

127
00:07:19,211 --> 00:07:20,350
okay,
I get where you're from.

128
00:07:20,900 --> 00:07:23,800
And I didn't have anything like that.
And so I tried to figure out how you,

129
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:24,873
in a very nice short way,
describe that you're kind of off the 

130
00:07:26,831 --> 00:07:28,450
map.
And that was what I came up with.

131
00:07:28,450 --> 00:07:29,950
Just this idea that,
listen,

132
00:07:29,951 --> 00:07:32,170
I'm from Mars as far as you're 
concerned.

133
00:07:32,460 --> 00:07:33,460
Uh,
because no word,

134
00:07:33,490 --> 00:07:34,600
I mean,
I would have to sit there and go,

135
00:07:34,601 --> 00:07:35,470
well,
I'm a little bit this.

136
00:07:35,471 --> 00:07:36,304
And then you,
you start to give them sort of a 

137
00:07:36,791 --> 00:07:37,624
political recipe,
30% this 20% and just political marsh 

138
00:07:40,221 --> 00:07:42,370
and ends up,
people can nod their head and say,

139
00:07:42,371 --> 00:07:43,450
okay,
I get it.

140
00:07:43,451 --> 00:07:44,284
You're off the grid somehow.
And some of it is also that you're 

141
00:07:46,871 --> 00:07:50,980
actively trying to,
to figure out things still,

142
00:07:50,981 --> 00:07:52,600
right?
Like we have this thing in America where

143
00:07:52,601 --> 00:07:53,434
everyone seems to believe or want 
everyone else to believe that they know 

144
00:07:57,101 --> 00:07:59,890
everything.
You don't come from that position.

145
00:08:00,100 --> 00:08:00,933
Well,
and it's a combination of that and 

146
00:08:02,020 --> 00:08:04,030
believing that you have,
and this is not,

147
00:08:04,060 --> 00:08:04,621
you know,
uh,

148
00:08:04,621 --> 00:08:07,420
I'm not insulting,
I hope people who have ideologies,

149
00:08:07,780 --> 00:08:08,613
but this idea that you could have a 
template that works all the time is 

150
00:08:12,971 --> 00:08:13,804
something that just doesn't appeal to me
because I think you have to be able to 

151
00:08:15,761 --> 00:08:17,350
pivot based on circumstances.

152
00:08:17,350 --> 00:08:20,530
You have to be able to,
to admit that something's not working.

153
00:08:20,531 --> 00:08:22,780
But if that conflicts with your 
ideology,

154
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:23,793
how do you reconcile those things?
You have to be able to learn based on 

155
00:08:25,931 --> 00:08:26,764
what you're actually seeing.
And I felt like there's not a whole lot 

156
00:08:28,811 --> 00:08:31,000
of flexibility sometimes in these 
ideologies.

157
00:08:31,030 --> 00:08:31,863
Yeah.
What percentage of people do you think 

158
00:08:32,771 --> 00:08:36,340
actually understand political ideologies
in general?

159
00:08:36,341 --> 00:08:38,620
That's what I was sort of talking about 
at the top of the show,

160
00:08:38,860 --> 00:08:39,693
but it's like,
I feel like people don't really 

161
00:08:40,601 --> 00:08:45,460
understand what really is the difference
between a liberal and a progressive or a

162
00:08:45,461 --> 00:08:47,860
libertarian and a conservative of that 
stuff.

163
00:08:47,861 --> 00:08:48,694
Like,
do you think most people even that talk 

164
00:08:49,931 --> 00:08:50,764
about politics professionally actually 
understand sort of the philosophic 

165
00:08:54,610 --> 00:08:56,400
underpinnings of this stuff?
Well,

166
00:08:56,520 --> 00:08:57,353
the easy answer to that is no,
but the second answer is partly because 

167
00:08:59,971 --> 00:09:02,280
those words have all changed in terms of
meaning.

168
00:09:02,310 --> 00:09:03,143
I mean,
take,

169
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:05,760
take,
take liberal as a perfect example.

170
00:09:06,210 --> 00:09:07,440
Uh,
I think I'm a liberal.

171
00:09:07,470 --> 00:09:08,303
I think you're a liberal.
I think most people in this country who 

172
00:09:09,871 --> 00:09:10,704
favor a democratic form of government 
based on freedom and rights and civic 

173
00:09:14,461 --> 00:09:15,294
action and all that,
that we're all liberals in the grand 

174
00:09:16,621 --> 00:09:18,150
scheme of things.
Um,

175
00:09:18,210 --> 00:09:20,550
you know,
you have to kind of sit down with people

176
00:09:20,551 --> 00:09:21,384
and,
and dive deeply into what they believe 

177
00:09:23,310 --> 00:09:24,560
to try to figure out,
you know,

178
00:09:24,570 --> 00:09:25,470
where they stand.
But,

179
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:26,333
but on the spectrum of governments all 
around the world throughout all time 

180
00:09:29,431 --> 00:09:30,480
periods,
we're all liberals.

181
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:31,051
Right?
Right.

182
00:09:31,051 --> 00:09:33,000
So we're just arguing over,
you know,

183
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:35,010
what percentage of this or that you want
to,

184
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:37,180
you want to put it into the category.
But so by,

185
00:09:37,220 --> 00:09:41,100
by not knowing what the words really 
mean or by conflating what they meet are

186
00:09:41,101 --> 00:09:41,940
changing what they mean.

187
00:09:42,180 --> 00:09:43,013
I think the reason people use 
progressive is because liberals been so 

188
00:09:45,420 --> 00:09:48,480
changed in terms of its meaning.
I don't think any of these terms,

189
00:09:48,481 --> 00:09:50,940
what does conservative mean?
I mean I'm fiscally conservative.

190
00:09:50,941 --> 00:09:53,760
What does that mean?
It just doesn't mean anything anymore.

191
00:09:53,910 --> 00:09:55,440
That as I,
as I've done this show,

192
00:09:55,441 --> 00:09:57,480
at least in this current incarnation for
last two years,

193
00:09:57,720 --> 00:09:58,553
I realized I use these labels cause 
sometimes you need them to frame 

194
00:10:02,011 --> 00:10:04,410
conversations and yet the more we use 
them,

195
00:10:04,411 --> 00:10:06,450
the more meaningless they become.
Which is a straight,

196
00:10:06,540 --> 00:10:08,700
I guess I'm a political Martian.
Well,

197
00:10:08,790 --> 00:10:09,623
and the thing is is that,
is that if you sit down and try to 

198
00:10:11,851 --> 00:10:13,470
figure out when you're talking to 
people,

199
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:14,553
um,
where do you stand on this issue or 

200
00:10:15,181 --> 00:10:16,014
where you stand on that issue.
I always feel like we're all a mix and 

201
00:10:18,510 --> 00:10:21,150
that if you think you're really up and 
down the line,

202
00:10:21,420 --> 00:10:23,400
give me a little time and I'll,
I'll figure out.

203
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:25,800
I always say we're all radical on 
something,

204
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:28,290
you know,
I'll find some subject where,

205
00:10:28,470 --> 00:10:30,600
you know,
if you said that you felt that way about

206
00:10:30,601 --> 00:10:33,240
it and gave no sort of clarifying 
remark,

207
00:10:33,241 --> 00:10:34,280
people would be like,
whoa.

208
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:37,170
I think,
I think that that describes all of us.

209
00:10:37,171 --> 00:10:38,910
I think we feel like we have to,
you know,

210
00:10:38,930 --> 00:10:39,763
I remember learning about totems and 
like psychology one oh one and I think 

211
00:10:42,631 --> 00:10:44,640
that's what a lot of people do where 
they sit there and say,

212
00:10:44,641 --> 00:10:45,474
part of my self image is that I'm a 
conservative or that I'm a liberal and 

213
00:10:48,931 --> 00:10:49,764
that locks you in to things.
I mean to be able to say that I base my 

214
00:10:53,791 --> 00:10:58,410
opinion on my own views and that I don't
have to fit into any particular box,

215
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:00,600
I find that completely liberating.
I mean,

216
00:11:00,601 --> 00:11:02,430
people will say that you're 
inconsistent.

217
00:11:02,460 --> 00:11:03,480
That's what the author,
well,

218
00:11:03,481 --> 00:11:05,580
you're really not going to say you don't
have a consistent philosophy.

219
00:11:06,090 --> 00:11:08,400
I'm not sure why.
I have to have a consistent philosophy.

220
00:11:08,460 --> 00:11:11,400
Why should we treat a political 
philosophy like a religion?

221
00:11:11,430 --> 00:11:13,490
That's actually the reverse of how we 
should treat it.

222
00:11:13,491 --> 00:11:16,280
And yet they seem to want this purity 
test online.

223
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:18,600
I mean,
I love that line and I think it was,

224
00:11:18,601 --> 00:11:19,680
um,
who was it,

225
00:11:19,681 --> 00:11:20,760
who said it?
I think it may have been,

226
00:11:20,761 --> 00:11:21,320
uh,
uh,

227
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:22,560
uh,
keynes who said,

228
00:11:22,890 --> 00:11:23,723
you know,
that somebody accused him of flip 

229
00:11:24,331 --> 00:11:26,130
flopping essentially we would call it 
flip flopping good.

230
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:27,960
And he said,
when the facts change,

231
00:11:27,990 --> 00:11:29,430
I change my mind.
What do you do?

232
00:11:30,030 --> 00:11:32,160
You know?
And that's Kinda how I feel.

233
00:11:32,161 --> 00:11:32,994
I mean I'm not going to get locked into,
I know that I tend to be in my own life 

234
00:11:35,851 --> 00:11:36,684
certain ways,
but if I'm a fiscal conservative for 

235
00:11:39,031 --> 00:11:39,930
example,
which I am,

236
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:42,960
and you find out that for this 
particular cause you need to spend a lot

237
00:11:42,961 --> 00:11:45,000
of money.
If I determine the cause is worth it,

238
00:11:45,001 --> 00:11:47,400
I'm going to spend a lot of money.
Does that mean I'm a flip flopper right.

239
00:11:47,401 --> 00:11:50,640
So I mean in that sense,
I guess I'm more of a pragmatist but,

240
00:11:50,641 --> 00:11:54,100
but even a pragmatist can be utopian

241
00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:55,480
in ways you could say,
okay,

242
00:11:55,481 --> 00:11:57,760
I want to base things on what's likely 
to work.

243
00:11:57,850 --> 00:12:00,520
At the same time I want to shoot for 
better than we have now.

244
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:03,430
Does that make you a pragmatic utopia?
Anest I mean,

245
00:12:03,460 --> 00:12:06,820
do those work and,
and once you start to mix those phrases,

246
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,670
do they mean anything anymore?
I'm a liberal conservative.

247
00:12:09,671 --> 00:12:11,530
I'm a,
I'm a conservative liberal.

248
00:12:11,531 --> 00:12:13,840
I'm a pragmatic utopia and this,
what are these ones?

249
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:16,630
A lot of stuff I like premeditated 
spontaneity.

250
00:12:16,631 --> 00:12:17,111
I mean,
you know,

251
00:12:17,111 --> 00:12:19,060
at what point does it,
does it not make any sense anymore?

252
00:12:19,140 --> 00:12:19,973
Yeah.
How frustrating to some of that get for 

253
00:12:21,901 --> 00:12:22,734
you as someone that tries to bring some 
of these ideas up that you have to talk 

254
00:12:26,401 --> 00:12:30,210
about things sort of in a way that 
sometimes can be a little,

255
00:12:30,211 --> 00:12:30,870
uh,
you know,

256
00:12:30,870 --> 00:12:32,070
confusing even for you.

257
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:36,710
What's frustrating and traditional media
because they demanded that I do that,

258
00:12:36,711 --> 00:12:39,020
which is why it was no,
I was always fighting with people,

259
00:12:39,390 --> 00:12:39,910
uh,
in,

260
00:12:39,910 --> 00:12:41,750
in the world that we're in now and new 
media.

261
00:12:41,751 --> 00:12:43,550
It's not frustrating at all.
I can be anywhere I want,

262
00:12:43,551 --> 00:12:46,400
which is why I'm a political Martian and
no one says anything.

263
00:12:46,490 --> 00:12:47,510
They're fine with it,
which is,

264
00:12:47,511 --> 00:12:48,344
you know,
to me that's a sign of the changing 

265
00:12:49,940 --> 00:12:50,773
maybe a state of things.
Although it also might be a sign that I 

266
00:12:52,731 --> 00:12:53,564
don't have a lot of liberal or 
conservative listener could be one or 

267
00:12:55,821 --> 00:12:56,654
the other.
I have a lot of political martians 

268
00:12:57,140 --> 00:12:57,560
listening.

269
00:12:57,560 --> 00:12:59,240
Yeah.
I think it's probably a little bit,

270
00:12:59,241 --> 00:13:00,110
a little bit about,
I suppose,

271
00:13:00,370 --> 00:13:01,203
uh,
tell me a little bit about your time in 

272
00:13:04,851 --> 00:13:08,450
the more mainstream media and what led 
you to say,

273
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:11,210
I'm going to go off the range here and 
see if I can figure this out on my own,

274
00:13:11,270 --> 00:13:12,320
which you've obviously been very sick.

275
00:13:12,580 --> 00:13:13,900
I never wanted to do though.
I didn't,

276
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:14,650
I didn't.
Um,

277
00:13:14,650 --> 00:13:15,221
I was,
uh,

278
00:13:15,221 --> 00:13:18,370
working here in town at,
at the ABC station and,

279
00:13:18,390 --> 00:13:20,200
uh,
I was working on the assignment desk and

280
00:13:20,201 --> 00:13:20,770
I thought,
you know,

281
00:13:20,770 --> 00:13:23,170
I was about 23 and I thought I had it 
made.

282
00:13:23,171 --> 00:13:24,004
I thought this was really good and these
reporters would come in who were only a 

283
00:13:26,381 --> 00:13:27,214
little bit older than I was.
And so what are you doing to get Outta 

284
00:13:28,790 --> 00:13:29,531
here?
And I said,

285
00:13:29,531 --> 00:13:31,030
not that I'm loving this,
this is great.

286
00:13:31,031 --> 00:13:31,511
And they said,
oh no,

287
00:13:31,511 --> 00:13:32,650
you'll die here.
You know,

288
00:13:32,651 --> 00:13:34,390
you'll be doing this forever.
Um,

289
00:13:34,420 --> 00:13:37,300
and so to sort of assuage them,
uh,

290
00:13:37,301 --> 00:13:40,450
I sent out tapes to be a reporter and no
one was getting hired.

291
00:13:40,451 --> 00:13:42,220
So I didn't think there was any real 
danger.

292
00:13:42,310 --> 00:13:44,110
And then I got hired.
Um,

293
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:46,780
I became a television reporter and then 
as life has it,

294
00:13:46,781 --> 00:13:48,070
you know,
opportunities intervene.

295
00:13:48,070 --> 00:13:48,903
And then someone gave me a talk radio 
show job and I was doing three hours a 

296
00:13:51,851 --> 00:13:53,170
day,
five days a week.

297
00:13:53,590 --> 00:13:57,340
And that's where I think things really 
started to grow and change because,

298
00:13:57,341 --> 00:13:58,040
you know,
um,

299
00:13:58,040 --> 00:13:58,781
and I,
I'm always,

300
00:13:58,781 --> 00:13:59,614
uh,
I always feel bad for the people that 

301
00:14:00,431 --> 00:14:01,264
are getting started today because I got 
to make all my egregious mistakes and 

302
00:14:04,901 --> 00:14:06,760
how all that stuff go out into the 
ether.

303
00:14:06,761 --> 00:14:07,594
It'd be gone if I started today,
those would all be some youtube video 

304
00:14:10,541 --> 00:14:11,374
all put together and they'd see every 
gaf and horrible thing I ever said or 

305
00:14:14,321 --> 00:14:14,630
made.

306
00:14:14,630 --> 00:14:16,190
Yeah.
That shouldn't be understated.

307
00:14:16,191 --> 00:14:17,330
Right.
What you're saying right there,

308
00:14:17,331 --> 00:14:20,000
because I think that's a huge thing.
And I mentioned that I had Dennis prager

309
00:14:20,001 --> 00:14:22,130
on a few weeks ago and I said to him,
you know,

310
00:14:22,131 --> 00:14:22,964
now that you're in the digital world,
you come from traditional media and 

311
00:14:25,131 --> 00:14:25,964
radio,
but how conscious are you of being 

312
00:14:28,161 --> 00:14:28,994
afraid of saying something that can just
be selectively edited or clipped in a 

313
00:14:33,341 --> 00:14:35,540
way that's going to make you seem,
like you said,

314
00:14:35,541 --> 00:14:36,374
the reverse thing,
and then just be relentlessly attacked 

315
00:14:38,121 --> 00:14:38,954
for that and the fact that you were able
to have the breeding ground before it 

316
00:14:41,841 --> 00:14:43,730
was fully on the,
the uh,

317
00:14:43,910 --> 00:14:44,570
the,
uh,

318
00:14:44,570 --> 00:14:47,270
I guess the infinity grid of existing 
forever

319
00:14:47,850 --> 00:14:52,070
sweet digital stone,
little stone as as there is

320
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:55,160
this thing,
those things will be out there now.

321
00:14:55,490 --> 00:14:58,310
Now that I'm,
now that I've got most,

322
00:14:58,311 --> 00:15:00,200
I hope of the egregious mistakes out of 
the way.

323
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:02,090
I liked it.
It's digital stuff.

324
00:15:02,110 --> 00:15:02,943
Yeah.
I mean I liked the idea that it's never 

325
00:15:03,501 --> 00:15:04,360
going away,
but it,

326
00:15:04,370 --> 00:15:05,203
but the kids coming up today who have to
make all their mistakes and have it be 

327
00:15:08,751 --> 00:15:10,090
forever available.
I'm,

328
00:15:10,091 --> 00:15:13,050
I'm sympathetic.
I'm glad I didn't exist in that air.

329
00:15:13,051 --> 00:15:15,380
I'm glad I was able to get all of my 
nonsense out of the way,

330
00:15:15,750 --> 00:15:17,150
um,
before it was forever.

331
00:15:17,151 --> 00:15:19,670
But yeah,
so in terms of my career,

332
00:15:20,210 --> 00:15:22,250
that's how you learn and,
and um,

333
00:15:22,330 --> 00:15:23,163
and,
and then also the political Martian 

334
00:15:24,951 --> 00:15:25,784
thing works itself out that way too.
Because in talk radio when I was there 

335
00:15:28,581 --> 00:15:29,414
as I think it still is,
it's really a conservative medium and 

336
00:15:32,170 --> 00:15:33,003
you know,
you would have a conservative guy then 

337
00:15:33,621 --> 00:15:36,440
you'd have me and then you'd have 
another conservative guy.

338
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:37,273
And I was the one who was continually,
I mean I was at odds with the audience 

339
00:15:39,650 --> 00:15:40,483
all the time and I was about 26 and the 
average age of talk radio was about 35 

340
00:15:44,301 --> 00:15:45,860
to 45.
And so,

341
00:15:45,861 --> 00:15:46,370
I mean,
I,

342
00:15:46,370 --> 00:15:47,203
it was,
um,

343
00:15:47,330 --> 00:15:51,860
it was a baptism by fire that looking 
back on it now was really good for me at

344
00:15:51,861 --> 00:15:54,050
the time.
It was really hard.

345
00:15:54,051 --> 00:15:55,850
But I mean,
that's how life is for everybody.

346
00:15:55,851 --> 00:15:56,270
I mean,
you,

347
00:15:56,270 --> 00:15:58,010
you know,
as you're working your career out,

348
00:15:58,011 --> 00:15:58,844
you have these ages where you're just 
pulling your hair out sometimes and now 

349
00:16:02,421 --> 00:16:04,700
you look back on it.
And it's a wonderful learning experience

350
00:16:04,701 --> 00:16:06,950
at the time,
not knowing the future,

351
00:16:07,150 --> 00:16:07,983
you know,
it's uh,

352
00:16:08,050 --> 00:16:08,883
as I think especially for guys in your 
twenties when you really are in a place 

353
00:16:12,321 --> 00:16:14,060
where you want to,
you know,

354
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:14,913
uh,
your self image is so wrapped up in how 

355
00:16:16,581 --> 00:16:20,000
you and gosh,
it was such a hard time period and now I

356
00:16:20,001 --> 00:16:22,190
look back on it and think though,
if you don't go through that,

357
00:16:22,220 --> 00:16:23,540
you're not where you are now.

358
00:16:23,870 --> 00:16:24,770
And so,
um,

359
00:16:24,950 --> 00:16:25,783
you know,
when you give your kids advice as a 

360
00:16:26,661 --> 00:16:27,494
parent,
there's going to be a lot of that I'm 

361
00:16:28,341 --> 00:16:29,870
going to throw at them and hope it 
sticks.

362
00:16:30,380 --> 00:16:33,350
Of course they are going to have that 
digital,

363
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:34,193
what do you call it?
The digital stone and digital stone 

364
00:16:35,691 --> 00:16:36,524
there.
Their stuff's going to all be etched in 

365
00:16:38,301 --> 00:16:42,260
digital and they also talk to the hand.
They don't want to hear anything dad has

366
00:16:42,261 --> 00:16:43,094
to say anyway.
So I'm not sure you can teach your kids 

367
00:16:44,391 --> 00:16:46,010
a lot sometimes.
I'm curious,

368
00:16:46,011 --> 00:16:46,844
so you're the,
you were the sort of liberal or marsh 

369
00:16:49,251 --> 00:16:52,310
and marsh and even around a lot of 
conservative radio.

370
00:16:52,311 --> 00:16:53,144
What do you think it is about 
conservatives that it's only 

371
00:16:56,061 --> 00:16:57,920
conservative that listened to radio?
Basically?

372
00:16:57,921 --> 00:16:58,754
I mean we know that liberal channels,
Air America and any of the progressive 

373
00:17:01,081 --> 00:17:01,851
stuff.
Yeah,

374
00:17:01,851 --> 00:17:02,684
I guess some of it exists here or there,
but it pretty much always fails or 

375
00:17:05,781 --> 00:17:06,380
nobody listens.

376
00:17:06,380 --> 00:17:08,750
Is there something about conservatives 
and talk,

377
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:10,910
do you think it's a good question.
And first of all,

378
00:17:10,911 --> 00:17:11,744
I always had a libertarian bent,
which allowed me a place where there 

379
00:17:14,391 --> 00:17:16,550
could be a meeting of the minds between 
the audience.

380
00:17:16,730 --> 00:17:18,860
If you talk about freedom and liberty 
and the constitution,

381
00:17:18,861 --> 00:17:20,480
which I do,
um,

382
00:17:20,690 --> 00:17:21,523
there was a place where we could have 
some commonalities and then work around 

383
00:17:24,561 --> 00:17:25,260
it.
Uh,

384
00:17:25,260 --> 00:17:26,093
in terms of liberal is because I believe
in things like social programs and 

385
00:17:29,481 --> 00:17:31,190
things like that.
So there were areas where,

386
00:17:31,390 --> 00:17:33,980
where we could have a little,
a little friendly competition,

387
00:17:33,981 --> 00:17:34,814
but,
but there were meeting of the minds 

388
00:17:35,391 --> 00:17:39,020
areas in terms of why,
um,

389
00:17:39,890 --> 00:17:41,180
you know,
rush limbaugh,

390
00:17:41,450 --> 00:17:42,283
he always likes to say that there will 
be a wing of the talk radio history 

391
00:17:45,261 --> 00:17:47,240
library and he's right and he will own 
that.

392
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:50,130
But by,
but by changing the landscape,

393
00:17:50,430 --> 00:17:52,860
you know,
I can't speak for other mediums.

394
00:17:52,861 --> 00:17:55,950
I can definitely talk about radio.
It's not extremely inventive and they're

395
00:17:55,951 --> 00:17:58,050
not extremely chance takers,
you know they do.

396
00:17:58,290 --> 00:18:01,470
And so when you see something works,
and I think limbaugh actually said this,

397
00:18:01,471 --> 00:18:04,260
he said for years they told me it'd be 
like someone else and not to do this.

398
00:18:04,261 --> 00:18:05,094
And then the minute he makes it then 
that then they just want you to be like 

399
00:18:07,951 --> 00:18:08,784
him.
I think that was partly my problem too 

400
00:18:10,711 --> 00:18:11,544
when I would go in there and say,
why do you want me to be like all these 

401
00:18:13,801 --> 00:18:14,634
other people?
They would say because that's what 

402
00:18:15,751 --> 00:18:17,310
works.
Look at what's working everywhere.

403
00:18:17,311 --> 00:18:18,144
So I think there's this attitude that,
I guess what I'm saying is if a liberal 

404
00:18:22,321 --> 00:18:25,950
talk show host made it big somewhere,
then you would see everybody's saying,

405
00:18:25,951 --> 00:18:27,390
well listen,
this is working in Boston.

406
00:18:27,390 --> 00:18:28,223
You should train of it.
So I think there's a tendency to follow 

407
00:18:30,271 --> 00:18:31,104
the leader in that business.
And I think he started off the trend 

408
00:18:34,350 --> 00:18:35,183
after the fairness doctrine ended.
Then if you go listen to talk radio 

409
00:18:37,021 --> 00:18:39,450
before limbo,
it's a completely different animal.

410
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:41,250
I mean I remember listening to it as a 
kid and it's,

411
00:18:41,350 --> 00:18:43,650
it doesn't bear any resemblance to what 
we have today.

412
00:18:43,830 --> 00:18:44,663
So once you see that working,
that becomes the template and if you 

413
00:18:47,191 --> 00:18:49,110
want to be big,
you need to do it that way.

414
00:18:49,111 --> 00:18:49,944
So that's why I had such a hard time for
12 years in the medium because I wasn't 

415
00:18:53,371 --> 00:18:56,340
like that.
Do you remember a guy by the name of Bob

416
00:18:56,340 --> 00:18:57,270
Grant?
You sure big.

417
00:18:57,810 --> 00:19:01,500
I remember being in the car with my mom 
when I was 1213 something like that.

418
00:19:01,710 --> 00:19:05,190
My mom hated this guy,
did not ever agree with him on anything.

419
00:19:05,460 --> 00:19:06,293
His callers would call in,
he would just scream at them and then 

420
00:19:08,191 --> 00:19:09,450
they'd hang up.
And it was,

421
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:12,270
it was just chaos.
And I remember thinking at the time,

422
00:19:12,271 --> 00:19:13,104
who could listen to this kind of chaos.
And yet he was one of the biggest guys 

423
00:19:15,860 --> 00:19:18,930
are done that to a guy named Joe Pine 
who was the original,

424
00:19:19,260 --> 00:19:21,810
and there was a lot of imitators,
but Joe Pine was,

425
00:19:21,811 --> 00:19:22,471
I want to say,
you know,

426
00:19:22,471 --> 00:19:26,520
you go back to like 1970 and pine 
actually had a TV show too.

427
00:19:26,521 --> 00:19:28,440
And it was the first one where you would
just,

428
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:31,020
cause before that it was like the Dick 
Cabinets and everybody you know,

429
00:19:31,021 --> 00:19:31,854
and the William f Buckley's and there 
were cigarettes and black and white and 

430
00:19:33,571 --> 00:19:37,710
high minded and Joe Pine would just say 
you're a communist and you yell at him.

431
00:19:38,070 --> 00:19:42,540
And you know what's funny is is that 
when these are novelties,

432
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:45,830
it's interesting,
but when it becomes the norm it,

433
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:46,980
it,
I mean I was,

434
00:19:46,981 --> 00:19:49,910
I was talking to somebody the other day 
and we were talking about what I heard a

435
00:19:49,980 --> 00:19:51,690
right wing talk show hosts say the other
day.

436
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:52,733
And I know he doesn't believe that,
but he's got to differentiate himself 

437
00:19:55,980 --> 00:19:57,960
from the competition.
So for example,

438
00:19:57,961 --> 00:20:01,560
they were talking about a riot.
And Berkeley and it was who could be the

439
00:20:01,561 --> 00:20:02,394
hardest on the rioters.
And this guy said they got to be taken 

440
00:20:04,411 --> 00:20:05,244
out by the police,
put in a back room and euthanize like 

441
00:20:06,781 --> 00:20:08,430
animals.
And you go,

442
00:20:08,790 --> 00:20:09,840
well,
why would he say that?

443
00:20:09,841 --> 00:20:10,674
Well,
he says that because he's got to 

444
00:20:11,251 --> 00:20:12,960
differentiate himself from the 
competition.

445
00:20:12,961 --> 00:20:13,794
Who said the toughest thing?
I mean this guy is going to go vacation 

446
00:20:16,050 --> 00:20:18,090
at his house in the hamptons after he 
said this.

447
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:19,133
Meanwhile,
he's ginned up the anger level in the 

448
00:20:21,511 --> 00:20:22,344
country so much more now.
Now there's not a lot of individual 

449
00:20:24,211 --> 00:20:27,990
responsibility because no individual is 
responsible for all of that.

450
00:20:28,380 --> 00:20:29,213
But collectively it's creating a 
situation where there's no 

451
00:20:31,621 --> 00:20:33,090
countervailing forces.
I mean,

452
00:20:33,091 --> 00:20:34,860
if you're ginning up the anger on this 
side,

453
00:20:35,220 --> 00:20:37,560
what's reducing the anger on that side?
What,

454
00:20:37,650 --> 00:20:39,930
what's helping us achieve some sort of 
status?

455
00:20:39,931 --> 00:20:41,400
And the answer is nothing.
Yeah.

456
00:20:41,430 --> 00:20:42,263
Well,
I think the answer might be maybe if I 

457
00:20:43,741 --> 00:20:44,574
could be so bold,
it would be a little bit of people like 

458
00:20:45,841 --> 00:20:47,980
us,
people that like us who

459
00:20:47,980 --> 00:20:50,020
are a little out of the system,
right?

460
00:20:50,021 --> 00:20:53,380
We're out of the mainstream system.
But we're trying to find some answers.

461
00:20:53,381 --> 00:20:54,214
So you get the,
the flame thrower saying crazy things 

462
00:20:56,261 --> 00:20:57,370
like that.
I was,

463
00:20:57,520 --> 00:20:59,290
you know,
talking about the protesters myself,

464
00:20:59,291 --> 00:21:00,820
but I'm certainly not for euthanizing 
them,

465
00:21:01,090 --> 00:21:04,900
but that people like us who actually 
tried to explore some of these ideas are

466
00:21:04,901 --> 00:21:07,820
maybe the counter balance now.
So I get some of that exists.

467
00:21:07,821 --> 00:21:11,800
Same people are listening know that.
And that's an inherent problem I guess.

468
00:21:11,801 --> 00:21:13,240
But I think we're getting some of them 
right,

469
00:21:13,241 --> 00:21:16,210
because we know this because the cable 
news and mainstream news,

470
00:21:16,211 --> 00:21:19,060
their numbers keep going down and 
digital stuff keeps rising.

471
00:21:19,061 --> 00:21:21,430
So we must be shifting some of those 
people over.

472
00:21:21,431 --> 00:21:22,264
Right?
I could suggest that maybe it's a genre 

473
00:21:24,101 --> 00:21:26,080
playing itself out,
you know,

474
00:21:26,110 --> 00:21:28,140
that's the other problem is that in the 
death throws me.

475
00:21:28,140 --> 00:21:28,973
Yeah.
And I think what happens is naturally 

476
00:21:30,461 --> 00:21:32,890
you take it more and more extreme,
right?

477
00:21:32,891 --> 00:21:33,970
Because when you're not,
it's,

478
00:21:34,060 --> 00:21:34,893
it's a little like a drug situation 
where you need more and more to get the 

479
00:21:37,601 --> 00:21:38,434
same effect,
but at a certain point you overdose and 

480
00:21:40,361 --> 00:21:41,260
die,
right?

481
00:21:41,320 --> 00:21:42,153
No matter how strong you are.
And I think when you're talking about 

482
00:21:44,771 --> 00:21:48,910
euthanizing protesters in the back room,
there's not much further you can go.

483
00:21:48,940 --> 00:21:49,773
Right.
And so maybe what happens at that point 

484
00:21:51,941 --> 00:21:56,860
is the genre and the medium and the 
style plays out and it's cyclical.

485
00:21:56,920 --> 00:21:58,990
I mean,
I think you could say that again,

486
00:21:58,991 --> 00:21:59,824
like,
like cutting off your heroin supply for 

487
00:22:00,851 --> 00:22:02,290
a while and going back.
I mean,

488
00:22:02,291 --> 00:22:03,124
it may come back another round,
but I'm not sure what these people can 

489
00:22:05,891 --> 00:22:06,724
do to continually gin up the level of 
anger so that those people are still 

490
00:22:10,751 --> 00:22:12,430
getting something out of the program.

491
00:22:12,460 --> 00:22:13,293
I mean,
I find this in my own political show 

492
00:22:14,201 --> 00:22:17,860
where after a while you think,
at least I think it's getting repetitive

493
00:22:18,130 --> 00:22:19,180
now.
What do you do?

494
00:22:19,210 --> 00:22:20,043
I mean,
if you've already said everything that 

495
00:22:21,191 --> 00:22:22,750
you think,
and I'm not willing to say stuff,

496
00:22:22,751 --> 00:22:23,960
I don't believe,
I'm not willing to,

497
00:22:24,090 --> 00:22:26,350
to take it to the next level,
to keep the heroin hit,

498
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:28,240
you know,
affecting you the way you want it to.

499
00:22:28,540 --> 00:22:29,830
Um,
at what point do you say,

500
00:22:29,831 --> 00:22:31,240
okay,
I've said everything I can say.

501
00:22:31,540 --> 00:22:33,190
Um,
you either take this or leave it,

502
00:22:33,191 --> 00:22:35,230
but I'm not going to continue to hammer 
this point home.

503
00:22:35,231 --> 00:22:36,730
I don't need to.
I'll do something else.

504
00:22:36,731 --> 00:22:38,650
Yeah.
I'm not sure everyone has that freedom.

505
00:22:38,651 --> 00:22:39,484
And I know that those people are being 
told by consultants on these talk 

506
00:22:42,101 --> 00:22:44,320
stations more heavier heat,
heat,

507
00:22:44,321 --> 00:22:45,610
heat.
Um,

508
00:22:45,730 --> 00:22:48,280
so what do you do in,
in those moments where you felt,

509
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:50,050
I've said this already,
this,

510
00:22:50,051 --> 00:22:50,884
I've made this case,
I've talked about this for a couple 

511
00:22:53,380 --> 00:22:55,870
months or maybe a couple of years and 
you want to shift.

512
00:22:55,870 --> 00:22:57,950
How do you actually,
do you tell your audience or,

513
00:22:57,951 --> 00:22:58,750
hey guys,
oh yeah.

514
00:22:58,750 --> 00:22:59,710
Oh yeah,
we're going.

515
00:23:00,070 --> 00:23:00,903
I've always been very,
we've been very open with them about my 

516
00:23:02,891 --> 00:23:03,724
struggles,
but partly is you try to find different 

517
00:23:05,351 --> 00:23:06,184
ways to,
to look at the point from different 

518
00:23:09,340 --> 00:23:10,091
angles.
I mean,

519
00:23:10,091 --> 00:23:11,620
that's what I think,
you know,

520
00:23:11,621 --> 00:23:13,690
media with,
with radio especially,

521
00:23:13,691 --> 00:23:16,300
they used to say that because people are
getting in and out of their cars,

522
00:23:16,301 --> 00:23:17,320
for example,
all the time.

523
00:23:17,560 --> 00:23:21,070
You can't go any deeper than 15 minutes 
because otherwise,

524
00:23:21,190 --> 00:23:22,023
you know,
you can't assume that people are 

525
00:23:22,631 --> 00:23:24,280
following you through this whole 
broadcast.

526
00:23:24,281 --> 00:23:26,260
I mean,
they used to say they have to know where

527
00:23:26,261 --> 00:23:29,740
you stand on every single issue within 
five minutes to turning on the radio.

528
00:23:30,070 --> 00:23:32,080
That's a cartoon character.
It's a cartoon.

529
00:23:32,140 --> 00:23:33,850
So I said to them that that's not going 
to happen.

530
00:23:33,851 --> 00:23:36,160
Now on,
on my program and on your program,

531
00:23:36,460 --> 00:23:37,293
you can show shades of gray and nuance 
and especially because that's actually 

532
00:23:41,051 --> 00:23:41,884
novel now.
Now that might play out the same way 

533
00:23:43,991 --> 00:23:45,380
that the right wing stuff is playing 
out.

534
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:46,190
Right?
But

535
00:23:46,190 --> 00:23:47,023
the novelty of being able to say 
everything is a little bit more complex 

536
00:23:49,941 --> 00:23:50,774
than you make it out to be is great,
but I've done more than 300 comments on 

537
00:23:53,961 --> 00:23:54,794
shows and I start running.
I'm not creative enough to continually 

538
00:23:57,171 --> 00:24:00,710
come out with new ways to do that,
at least not to my satisfaction.

539
00:24:00,711 --> 00:24:03,260
The audience says they still want to 
hear more of this stuff,

540
00:24:04,100 --> 00:24:05,870
but I'm not sure I want to give it to 
them.

541
00:24:05,871 --> 00:24:08,450
That to me seems too much like what I 
got away from.

542
00:24:08,840 --> 00:24:09,673
Um,

543
00:24:09,950 --> 00:24:10,783
this is the true artists struggle.
I don't know if you think about it in 

544
00:24:13,101 --> 00:24:13,934
those terms,
but really this is the struggle of an 

545
00:24:14,931 --> 00:24:15,764
artist to create something successful 
and then still feel enough inner power 

546
00:24:20,361 --> 00:24:24,080
to continue and not pander and make 
something new and all that.

547
00:24:24,170 --> 00:24:25,003
It shows you really thought about it 
cause it's exactly right and it's 

548
00:24:26,621 --> 00:24:28,780
something that I didn't get initially.
I had to,

549
00:24:29,260 --> 00:24:32,710
I had to learn it by slowly but surely.
First of all,

550
00:24:33,670 --> 00:24:38,020
getting used to the idea that anything 
you're doing is art is weird because you

551
00:24:38,021 --> 00:24:40,430
can't call yourself an artist.
Artist is something that the,

552
00:24:40,490 --> 00:24:44,230
that the other people have to say.
And first of all,

553
00:24:44,231 --> 00:24:46,640
I don't think that anything that we do 
politically is I,

554
00:24:46,680 --> 00:24:50,620
and that's part of the problem because 
now the other podcast that I'm doing has

555
00:24:50,621 --> 00:24:53,450
evolved into something that is a little,
a little bit like art anyway.

556
00:24:53,950 --> 00:24:54,783
And it's so satisfying to be able to do 
something where you stand back and you 

557
00:24:58,091 --> 00:24:58,924
look at it and you go,
I'd like my grandchildren to hear that 

558
00:25:01,241 --> 00:25:02,074
because if I die before they meet me,
they'll get a chance to know me through 

559
00:25:06,671 --> 00:25:07,030
this.

560
00:25:07,030 --> 00:25:09,310
Whereas the more I listened to the 
political stuff,

561
00:25:09,340 --> 00:25:11,200
even my own stuff,
um,

562
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:13,060
there's,
I don't see any art and it,

563
00:25:13,080 --> 00:25:15,190
and,
and once you've done some painting,

564
00:25:15,191 --> 00:25:16,024
if you will,
the idea of going and doing my pool 

565
00:25:18,671 --> 00:25:20,050
cleaning job,
it's just not as,

566
00:25:20,070 --> 00:25:21,090
as not as,
um,

567
00:25:21,190 --> 00:25:25,180
satisfying.
And at a certain point I'm tired of it.

568
00:25:25,250 --> 00:25:26,083
I mean,
I think we live in a country that's a 

569
00:25:28,331 --> 00:25:31,750
representative democracy,
which requires us to be engaged.

570
00:25:32,110 --> 00:25:33,640
Um,
but you,

571
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:35,980
because of what you do are hyper 
engaged.

572
00:25:36,190 --> 00:25:37,023
I'm hyper engaged at a certain point.
And this is why I didn't do 12 straight 

573
00:25:40,091 --> 00:25:41,650
years of talk radio because you burn 
out.

574
00:25:41,990 --> 00:25:45,070
And especially in my case,
and you and I talked about this earlier,

575
00:25:45,310 --> 00:25:46,143
I mean,
I'm a guy who feels like I rubbed the 

576
00:25:47,861 --> 00:25:50,140
magic lamp and the genie came out and 
said,

577
00:25:50,141 --> 00:25:51,220
you have a wish.

578
00:25:51,220 --> 00:25:51,851
What is it?
I said,

579
00:25:51,851 --> 00:25:54,700
I want a political outsider because 
these politicians are killing us.

580
00:25:54,970 --> 00:25:56,560
And he gave me Donald Trump and I 
thought,

581
00:25:57,130 --> 00:25:57,963
whoa,
I really should have had a lawyer with 

582
00:25:59,231 --> 00:26:02,110
me to decide exactly how I wanted to 
phrase that wish.

583
00:26:02,940 --> 00:26:03,773
And but what that does in my particular 
case is I'm not sure what to do anymore 

584
00:26:07,601 --> 00:26:12,130
because I got what I asked for four,
I've been doing this 24 25 years.

585
00:26:12,131 --> 00:26:12,964
If you had my radio thing,
I never thought I'd get a political 

586
00:26:14,891 --> 00:26:17,500
outsider.
Now I have one and look what I got.

587
00:26:17,680 --> 00:26:21,130
So what do I tell my odd against now 
where do I go from here?

588
00:26:21,320 --> 00:26:23,990
For the few of us that publicly or in a 
similar space,

589
00:26:23,991 --> 00:26:27,290
I feel that very intimately,
exactly what you're talking about.

590
00:26:27,380 --> 00:26:28,213
I've spent a lot of time in the last 
year or two talking about what I think 

591
00:26:30,471 --> 00:26:31,304
is wrong with the left because I'm a 
liberal and I want the left to be 

592
00:26:34,401 --> 00:26:36,590
liberal again.
And now we have trump,

593
00:26:36,591 --> 00:26:38,600
which brings this whole other set of 
problems.

594
00:26:38,690 --> 00:26:39,740
And,
and people say to me,

595
00:26:39,741 --> 00:26:41,270
well,
you're not attacking him enough.

596
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:42,470
And it's like,
well,

597
00:26:42,471 --> 00:26:43,304
we now have this x factor in,
everything is kind of upside down right 

598
00:26:46,351 --> 00:26:47,070
now.
And it,

599
00:26:47,070 --> 00:26:51,540
I guess it's incumbent on people like us
to pave the way for other people because

600
00:26:51,541 --> 00:26:52,291
they're,
they're waiting.

601
00:26:52,291 --> 00:26:53,124
Right.

602
00:26:53,940 --> 00:26:54,570
Well,
I mean,

603
00:26:54,570 --> 00:26:57,780
let's get to trump for a second because,
because to me,

604
00:26:57,781 --> 00:27:00,210
you had started out with talking about 
ideologies.

605
00:27:01,770 --> 00:27:03,990
This is a different thing entirely.
First of all,

606
00:27:03,991 --> 00:27:04,824
I always say if,
if you could have had a crystal ball 

607
00:27:06,331 --> 00:27:07,164
during the campaign and you could've 
shown who the nominees for various 

608
00:27:11,580 --> 00:27:12,413
official positions would have been,
trump doesn't get elected no matter who 

609
00:27:14,761 --> 00:27:16,050
you runs against.
Um,

610
00:27:16,051 --> 00:27:16,884
and I don't think he gets elected if 
he's running against even Joe Biden who 

611
00:27:18,961 --> 00:27:19,910
I consider to be,
you know,

612
00:27:19,950 --> 00:27:22,680
kind of a zero.
I think Biden runs away with it.

613
00:27:22,710 --> 00:27:23,543
Um,
I think he's a manifestation of our 

614
00:27:25,921 --> 00:27:27,930
dissatisfaction with the political 
system,

615
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:28,950
which we are.
I mean,

616
00:27:28,951 --> 00:27:30,780
I don't know anybody who satisfied with 
it.

617
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:31,820
Right.
Um,

618
00:27:32,550 --> 00:27:33,383
and at the same time,
it's not necessarily going to take us 

619
00:27:36,391 --> 00:27:37,224
away from our problems because our 
problems are too much power in the 

620
00:27:40,171 --> 00:27:41,004
presidency.

621
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:44,190
Not Enough attention paid to the 
constitution.

622
00:27:44,670 --> 00:27:45,503
And the fact that we've gotten away from
the various things that make America 

623
00:27:47,311 --> 00:27:48,144
great,
which is things like the separation of 

624
00:27:49,171 --> 00:27:51,480
powers,
checks and balances,

625
00:27:52,020 --> 00:27:55,440
but the tendency of Americans is to 
blame things on,

626
00:27:55,441 --> 00:27:58,550
for example,
the last administration or something we,

627
00:27:58,620 --> 00:28:02,430
this is 50 years of trends building on 
top of trends.

628
00:28:02,580 --> 00:28:04,410
This is not a new thing.
Um,

629
00:28:04,460 --> 00:28:05,293
and every president in my lifetime has 
taken us farther down the road to what 

630
00:28:09,270 --> 00:28:11,760
presidential historian slash singer 
called the imperial presidency.

631
00:28:11,761 --> 00:28:13,680
Well now it's the hyper imperial 
presidency.

632
00:28:13,980 --> 00:28:16,680
We have a congress that reminds you of 
the Roman Senate.

633
00:28:16,790 --> 00:28:18,120
Yup.
At the end where,

634
00:28:18,300 --> 00:28:18,931
where,
you know,

635
00:28:18,931 --> 00:28:19,764
if you say,
what is the real skill level that you 

636
00:28:21,811 --> 00:28:23,820
possess as a senator,
it's fun raising,

637
00:28:24,190 --> 00:28:25,080
right?
Lawrence Lessig,

638
00:28:25,081 --> 00:28:26,050
the,
the uh,

639
00:28:26,250 --> 00:28:28,350
Harvard law professor had said that,
you know,

640
00:28:28,351 --> 00:28:29,184
he,
he diagrammed how you work your way up 

641
00:28:31,261 --> 00:28:32,520
through the political system now.

642
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:33,473
And the first thing they asked you when 
you want to be a small town mayor 

643
00:28:35,791 --> 00:28:38,280
somewhere,
but have a little d or a little lower by

644
00:28:38,281 --> 00:28:40,500
your name is how good are you worked 
fund raising.

645
00:28:40,520 --> 00:28:41,353
Yeah.
So by the time you actually achieve a 

646
00:28:42,511 --> 00:28:45,690
higher office,
what was the number one qualification?

647
00:28:45,691 --> 00:28:47,210
They were looking for the whole way.
Yeah,

648
00:28:47,310 --> 00:28:49,800
but you were a good legislator that none
of those things.

649
00:28:50,010 --> 00:28:52,620
So these people,
I had a grandmother who was this amazing

650
00:28:52,621 --> 00:28:54,490
fundraiser and she would raise funds for
charities.

651
00:28:54,491 --> 00:28:57,540
She would go to these events and you,
that's what these people are good at.

652
00:28:57,560 --> 00:28:58,393
Yeah.
So it should surprise us very little 

653
00:28:59,731 --> 00:29:01,230
when you say,
okay,

654
00:29:01,231 --> 00:29:03,870
we need a check and balance here.
And they're not there.

655
00:29:04,050 --> 00:29:04,883
They're only there now.
There'll be there if they're 

656
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:09,480
contributors want them to be there or if
they can make political hay.

657
00:29:09,810 --> 00:29:11,190
But in terms,
I mean you watch,

658
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:13,890
you watch the Republicans now in 
Congress and it's,

659
00:29:14,520 --> 00:29:15,353
if it wasn't so serious,
it's fun to watch because people are 

660
00:29:18,481 --> 00:29:22,200
some of the most astute hedgers you've 
ever seen in your life,

661
00:29:22,201 --> 00:29:23,940
but they don't know how to hedge.
Now on this one,

662
00:29:24,180 --> 00:29:26,100
they're sitting there at a fork in the 
road going,

663
00:29:26,370 --> 00:29:29,520
do I cast my lot with the trump 
administration is going to be a big star

664
00:29:29,521 --> 00:29:32,940
in a hero in 10 years?
In which case I turned the right turn at

665
00:29:32,941 --> 00:29:33,774
Albuquerque and it worked out right.
Or is he going to be seen as a disaster 

666
00:29:36,521 --> 00:29:38,790
when anyone who was aligned with him is,
you know,

667
00:29:39,140 --> 00:29:40,710
a nightmare.
So do I need to take,

668
00:29:40,740 --> 00:29:42,100
they don't know what to do and all they

669
00:29:42,100 --> 00:29:42,933
want to do is figure out the way where 
they're going to turn out the best so 

670
00:29:45,401 --> 00:29:47,890
that I get reelected or whatever down 
the road.

671
00:29:47,891 --> 00:29:48,724
I mean,
all of these people are so concerned 

672
00:29:49,811 --> 00:29:53,260
about a job that they should only do 
temporarily anyway,

673
00:29:53,530 --> 00:29:56,950
that it's warped their entire ability to
have anything connected to what we would

674
00:29:56,951 --> 00:29:58,990
call leadership today.
You,

675
00:29:59,000 --> 00:29:59,833
you've hit on so many things that I talk
about all the time on the show about 

676
00:30:01,781 --> 00:30:05,190
separation of powers and an imperialist,
right?

677
00:30:05,320 --> 00:30:05,770
And,
and,

678
00:30:05,770 --> 00:30:06,603
and why we should be governed by the 
constitution and not just by the whims 

679
00:30:10,510 --> 00:30:11,343
of current events and things like that.
So the imperial presidency I think is a 

680
00:30:13,601 --> 00:30:16,720
really interesting thing because I've 
been on the record for years that when,

681
00:30:16,721 --> 00:30:17,470
when,
uh,

682
00:30:17,470 --> 00:30:18,303
George W.
Bush was doing all the executive 

683
00:30:19,541 --> 00:30:20,374
actions,
I was against them when Obama was doing 

684
00:30:21,791 --> 00:30:22,690
them,
I was against them.

685
00:30:22,870 --> 00:30:23,703
I'm against them now.
Now we have a guy who's obviously 

686
00:30:25,151 --> 00:30:29,710
willing to govern fully by an 
authoritarian who's willing to govern by

687
00:30:29,711 --> 00:30:30,700
them.
But it's,

688
00:30:30,701 --> 00:30:33,550
it's like,
it's not only his fault,

689
00:30:33,551 --> 00:30:36,820
it's not his fault for grabbing the 
power that has anybody who was going to,

690
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:38,350
to him,
somebody was going to do it,

691
00:30:38,351 --> 00:30:41,020
somebody who was going.
So is that the best argument for limited

692
00:30:41,021 --> 00:30:41,854
government then that forget what your 
politics are on specific issues that 

693
00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:46,713
these people that want money and want 
reelections and that are okay to be 

694
00:30:50,310 --> 00:30:51,143
authoritarian.
The only fight against them is to reign 

695
00:30:53,231 --> 00:30:54,064
in the power they have over us.
Let's talk about that for me because 

696
00:30:56,111 --> 00:30:57,360
that's another one of those terms.
So,

697
00:30:57,361 --> 00:30:58,194
just like we were talking about at the 
beginning of liberal and conservative 

698
00:30:59,590 --> 00:31:01,990
molly's things that are hard to define a
real meaning.

699
00:31:01,991 --> 00:31:02,824
What does limit,
who has a limited government in the 

700
00:31:03,731 --> 00:31:07,150
world find what country in the world 
has?

701
00:31:07,180 --> 00:31:10,570
Well that's a functioning country,
a limited government who has that?

702
00:31:11,050 --> 00:31:11,883
Because the truth is is we have a 
country here that has 300 million 

703
00:31:15,311 --> 00:31:18,160
people.
We have a budget that is enormous.

704
00:31:18,550 --> 00:31:21,220
We have needs that are incredible.
Um,

705
00:31:21,910 --> 00:31:22,743
how could you have a limited government?
Well limited I would argue limited 

706
00:31:25,151 --> 00:31:25,984
meaning that it should just do less.
It should have a little less control 

707
00:31:29,321 --> 00:31:30,154
over us,
meaning that it should take less from 

708
00:31:31,301 --> 00:31:33,580
us.
So lower taxes as a general thing.

709
00:31:33,700 --> 00:31:35,980
We could probably scale back the 
military a little bit.

710
00:31:36,190 --> 00:31:37,023
We could probably scale back some social
services and they might be taken over a 

711
00:31:39,521 --> 00:31:42,340
little more by private enterprise.
That sort of thing.

712
00:31:42,550 --> 00:31:45,040
I don't mean that we should dismantle 
the government and not,

713
00:31:45,230 --> 00:31:47,050
you know,
have a driver's license on.

714
00:31:47,080 --> 00:31:48,940
The problem is,
is that you end up,

715
00:31:49,300 --> 00:31:50,133
if you take away,
if you go and you started to remove 

716
00:31:51,941 --> 00:31:53,680
things,
you would find out,

717
00:31:53,681 --> 00:31:54,700
I think it's a belief.

718
00:31:54,700 --> 00:31:56,860
So cause we don't do this so it's all 
theoretical,

719
00:31:56,890 --> 00:31:57,723
right?
But the belief is is that if you took 

720
00:31:59,981 --> 00:32:00,814
away this stuff,
you would find out why it appeared in 

721
00:32:03,161 --> 00:32:03,994
the first place.
Now does that mean it's going to come 

722
00:32:05,831 --> 00:32:06,664
back in a form that's as bloated and 
because we all understand that the 

723
00:32:09,701 --> 00:32:12,700
government has built in budgetary 
increases every year,

724
00:32:12,790 --> 00:32:14,560
which is again you would say part of the
problem.

725
00:32:14,561 --> 00:32:17,320
This is where a zero balance budgeting 
and all that stuff comes into play.

726
00:32:17,780 --> 00:32:20,800
The real wake up call for Americans.
Um,

727
00:32:21,340 --> 00:32:24,190
and it's funny because if,
if I could do anything,

728
00:32:24,191 --> 00:32:25,024
if you were to just say,
I'm going to cut the defense budget by 

729
00:32:26,711 --> 00:32:27,544
two thirds and I'm going to give every 
American a travel budget where they can 

730
00:32:30,491 --> 00:32:34,000
go around the world and begin to see how
other countries work.

731
00:32:34,001 --> 00:32:37,660
Because the biggest nightmare for 
Americans in terms of upsetting all your

732
00:32:37,661 --> 00:32:41,210
beliefs is to go to some of these other 
and be shocked that it works.

733
00:32:41,540 --> 00:32:44,810
I mean go to Scandinavia.
Scandinavian would not work here because

734
00:32:44,811 --> 00:32:47,600
the entire system is dependent upon you 
being Scandinavia.

735
00:32:48,050 --> 00:32:50,270
It's basically a homogeneous and I had 
a,

736
00:32:50,271 --> 00:32:52,940
I had a scandinavian girlfriend and,
and we,

737
00:32:52,941 --> 00:32:53,774
uh,
we were getting on the freeway here in 

738
00:32:54,891 --> 00:32:57,440
Los Angeles and as you know,
getting on the freeway in Los Angeles is

739
00:32:57,441 --> 00:32:58,550
a struggle.
I mean,

740
00:32:58,551 --> 00:32:59,384
you know,
you have,

741
00:32:59,450 --> 00:33:01,640
and she looked at me and she said,
this is what's wrong with America.

742
00:33:01,641 --> 00:33:03,890
She goes in Sweden,
it would be left hand,

743
00:33:03,891 --> 00:33:04,760
would go right here,
would go,

744
00:33:04,761 --> 00:33:06,080
left hand will go.
And I said,

745
00:33:06,081 --> 00:33:07,460
that's what's wrong with you people.
I said,

746
00:33:07,461 --> 00:33:10,580
that's why you can't compete like we can
because we fight for everything.

747
00:33:10,770 --> 00:33:11,603
Right.
I mean even getting on the freeway is a 

748
00:33:12,531 --> 00:33:14,360
struggle,
but when you go there,

749
00:33:14,930 --> 00:33:15,763
what's shocking to an American is that 
they have a system that would not work 

750
00:33:17,541 --> 00:33:18,680
here,
but it works there.

751
00:33:18,920 --> 00:33:20,750
And they don't tell you when you're 
growing up.

752
00:33:20,870 --> 00:33:21,561
These things.
I mean,

753
00:33:21,561 --> 00:33:22,394
you have to actually see it.
Now what that means is you come back 

754
00:33:24,771 --> 00:33:26,660
here and you say,
okay,

755
00:33:26,870 --> 00:33:29,870
government is not necessarily,
we're kind of taught.

756
00:33:29,871 --> 00:33:32,410
Sometimes the government is necessarily 
inefficient and,

757
00:33:32,470 --> 00:33:35,420
and can't work.
And I always say that that's a defeatist

758
00:33:35,421 --> 00:33:36,920
attitude.
Um,

759
00:33:36,950 --> 00:33:39,950
back when the Clinton Gore,
um,

760
00:33:40,460 --> 00:33:42,890
White House was brand new,
they had a program that they called,

761
00:33:42,891 --> 00:33:43,724
had a great name,
great market look at reinventing 

762
00:33:44,931 --> 00:33:45,764
government.
And the idea was that this is not 

763
00:33:47,961 --> 00:33:50,120
necessarily the way government has to 
be,

764
00:33:50,180 --> 00:33:51,920
right?
Could we improve it?

765
00:33:51,921 --> 00:33:52,754
Could we make it better?
What I'm always suggesting is we really 

766
00:33:54,951 --> 00:33:58,190
haven't tried,
and remember it's a big bureaucracy.

767
00:33:58,220 --> 00:34:00,230
Even if you decide you want to go in and
change it,

768
00:34:00,231 --> 00:34:01,041
it's hard to change.
I mean,

769
00:34:01,041 --> 00:34:01,874
I think when you're going to find out 
with trump is he gonna find out pretty 

770
00:34:03,741 --> 00:34:07,460
darn soon that the bureaucracy has a lot
of ability to push back,

771
00:34:07,490 --> 00:34:07,730
right?

772
00:34:07,730 --> 00:34:08,563
So when I talk limited government,
for me it's about dismantling some of 

773
00:34:10,701 --> 00:34:11,534
that bureaucracy so that potentially we 
could maybe get to some of that Clinton 

774
00:34:14,661 --> 00:34:17,210
and Gore stuff.
For me when I look at the system,

775
00:34:17,840 --> 00:34:18,673
the one thing that we could do that 
would affect the lives of average 

776
00:34:21,591 --> 00:34:22,424
Americans,
the least in terms of cutting big 

777
00:34:24,231 --> 00:34:26,900
government is changed the foreign 
policy.

778
00:34:27,470 --> 00:34:29,660
Because when you look at discretionary 
spending,

779
00:34:29,661 --> 00:34:31,840
and as we all know,
many of the things like Medicare,

780
00:34:31,940 --> 00:34:33,290
that's not discretion,
social security,

781
00:34:33,291 --> 00:34:36,080
those are not discretionary spending.
The military though is,

782
00:34:36,440 --> 00:34:37,273
um,
and remember that if you go actually 

783
00:34:38,361 --> 00:34:41,510
look at a 1960 budget for the u s 
military and a budget,

784
00:34:41,511 --> 00:34:45,680
now it's totally apples and oranges 
because of the way they did deliberately

785
00:34:45,681 --> 00:34:48,050
hidden things.
So the 1960 budget for example,

786
00:34:48,051 --> 00:34:50,990
the veteran's affairs costs are all 
built into the defense budget.

787
00:34:51,020 --> 00:34:54,140
Now it's a separate part of the budget.
So when you'll hear somebody say,

788
00:34:54,141 --> 00:34:55,700
well,
we don't spend that much on defense now.

789
00:34:56,030 --> 00:34:58,840
Well deliberately apples and oranges,
like so much of the budget.

790
00:34:58,860 --> 00:35:01,070
Same thing with uh,
with unemployment numbers.

791
00:35:01,071 --> 00:35:02,480
I mean,
you can't compare the,

792
00:35:02,660 --> 00:35:05,900
the ones in the old days to now cause we
exclude people that haven't been looking

793
00:35:05,901 --> 00:35:06,510
for work,
right?

794
00:35:06,510 --> 00:35:07,071
First.
Okay.

795
00:35:07,071 --> 00:35:12,071
So when you look at the amount of money 
we spend and you say that's free money,

796
00:35:12,500 --> 00:35:14,930
that's money you could allocate 
elsewhere,

797
00:35:15,020 --> 00:35:15,853
right?
So when you talk about cutting 

798
00:35:16,551 --> 00:35:19,130
government,
what would happen if you cut the defense

799
00:35:19,131 --> 00:35:23,090
budget in half?
I think we're still the largest military

800
00:35:23,091 --> 00:35:25,310
spending country in the world.
By the way.

801
00:35:25,311 --> 00:35:26,144
I should point out that we have a 
department of defense and yet Americans 

802
00:35:29,991 --> 00:35:34,430
have not fought on American soil.
My mother is 80 years old.

803
00:35:34,431 --> 00:35:38,880
She was to the last time Americans 
fought on American soil.

804
00:35:39,300 --> 00:35:44,070
What does that money buying us?
So when you talk about well-spent funds,

805
00:35:44,910 --> 00:35:46,770
is there a lot of waste and fraud in 
Medicare?

806
00:35:46,771 --> 00:35:50,700
You darn right there is,
but through the government pipeline,

807
00:35:50,820 --> 00:35:51,653
people are being helped on the other end
who's being helped by the defense 

808
00:35:54,241 --> 00:35:55,200
budget?
Right?

809
00:35:55,470 --> 00:35:56,730
Um,
when I bring this up,

810
00:35:56,731 --> 00:35:57,564
I'm called an isolationist,
which is a term that goes back to the 

811
00:35:59,731 --> 00:36:02,400
1940 [inaudible].
It has all sorts of baggage on purpose.

812
00:36:04,470 --> 00:36:05,303
All I want is a government with a 
foreign policy like every other 

813
00:36:09,601 --> 00:36:10,434
government in the world.
How can that by definition be 

814
00:36:13,201 --> 00:36:14,034
isolationists?
How many basis outside of Russia does 

815
00:36:16,231 --> 00:36:17,064
Russia have,
which is probably the next most 

816
00:36:17,971 --> 00:36:20,070
interventions.
I think you can count them on one hand.

817
00:36:20,250 --> 00:36:21,083
Okay,
we have in excess of 125 maybe he used 

818
00:36:24,691 --> 00:36:26,220
to be 180.
Um,

819
00:36:26,280 --> 00:36:28,160
and you pay for that does a taxpayer,
right?

820
00:36:28,210 --> 00:36:29,520
What do you get for that?
We'll,

821
00:36:29,550 --> 00:36:31,680
is this where trump actually made 
headway with things?

822
00:36:31,681 --> 00:36:32,730
Because he would say,
well,

823
00:36:32,731 --> 00:36:33,564
why do we have bases in Japan?
She should be enough for forgetting the 

824
00:36:36,991 --> 00:36:38,550
moral center that we may not be sure 
about it.

825
00:36:38,551 --> 00:36:39,384
But if you're just the average person,
because he basically made the argument 

826
00:36:41,461 --> 00:36:44,910
you're making,
why is Japan paying us to protect them?

827
00:36:45,060 --> 00:36:47,820
So he's making the sort of same argument
that you're laying out there,

828
00:36:47,821 --> 00:36:48,570
right?

829
00:36:48,570 --> 00:36:51,030
Maybe not as both thought out but,
but,

830
00:36:51,031 --> 00:36:51,864
but it's a good point.
And the reason he made it though is the 

831
00:36:53,041 --> 00:36:53,874
reason that every president you could 
think of makes the argument and that is 

832
00:36:57,751 --> 00:36:58,584
that the United States public has been 
and always is accepted the most extreme 

833
00:37:02,581 --> 00:37:05,400
situations of a mind that they don't 
want that.

834
00:37:05,560 --> 00:37:07,860
And,
and when you go look at how this started

835
00:37:07,861 --> 00:37:08,694
between 1945 and 1952 is when the 
country made a huge change in foreign 

836
00:37:11,671 --> 00:37:15,130
policy and we've never looked back.
They knew you could read the,

837
00:37:15,131 --> 00:37:15,964
the Truman administration and the things
that they knew that the people didn't 

838
00:37:18,841 --> 00:37:20,430
want this because it's natural.
They say,

839
00:37:20,431 --> 00:37:21,840
why am I spending money for this,
that,

840
00:37:21,841 --> 00:37:23,230
or the other thing.
Um,

841
00:37:23,460 --> 00:37:24,293
that's why George W.
Bush ran for a more humble foreign 

842
00:37:26,251 --> 00:37:27,084
policy.
That's why President Woodrow Wilson and 

843
00:37:28,921 --> 00:37:31,810
Franklin Roosevelt both won elections 
before they took us into world.

844
00:37:31,810 --> 00:37:33,960
War is on promises to keep you out of 
world wars.

845
00:37:34,140 --> 00:37:37,680
There's no precedent that runs for the 
United States top job and says,

846
00:37:37,830 --> 00:37:38,663
if you elect me,
we're going to be in more foreign 

847
00:37:40,201 --> 00:37:42,690
countries.
It doesn't happen because the electorate

848
00:37:42,691 --> 00:37:44,520
doesn't want that.
And yet that's what we get.

849
00:37:44,700 --> 00:37:45,960
So what,
what does that say then?

850
00:37:45,961 --> 00:37:48,210
Cause if you think about it,
when Obama ran the first time,

851
00:37:48,211 --> 00:37:51,420
one of the reasons he beat Hillary in 
the primary was because he was harder on

852
00:37:51,421 --> 00:37:52,254
getting out of Iraq immediately.
That was one of the reasons he was able 

853
00:37:54,331 --> 00:37:57,090
to get through the primary to beat her.
Yet at the same time,

854
00:37:57,120 --> 00:37:57,953
he,
I think he's the only president we've 

855
00:37:59,641 --> 00:38:02,550
ever had that his entire eight years we 
were at war,

856
00:38:02,551 --> 00:38:05,970
we've been in Afghanistan for this 
entire ears were still there.

857
00:38:05,971 --> 00:38:06,900
We don't even know.
I mean,

858
00:38:06,901 --> 00:38:08,970
I don't think anyone has any clue why 
we're there anymore.

859
00:38:09,030 --> 00:38:12,440
I think you need you to find war because
I was going to say,

860
00:38:12,450 --> 00:38:13,283
I don't think we've not been at war 
since 1947 probably since the Truman 

861
00:38:19,621 --> 00:38:20,790
doctrine.
Uh,

862
00:38:20,791 --> 00:38:22,770
but it depends on what you mean.
I mean,

863
00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:24,233
is it war if your funding war somewhere 
else or is it only wore if your people 

864
00:38:28,801 --> 00:38:31,560
are actually fighting and dying?
Because we've been funding war,

865
00:38:31,880 --> 00:38:32,520
you know,
and,

866
00:38:32,520 --> 00:38:34,170
and understand there's a whole 
rationale.

867
00:38:34,171 --> 00:38:36,600
It's called military that,
um,

868
00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:38,500
and you can go back and read the 
documents at the time.

869
00:38:38,501 --> 00:38:39,850
They're very open about it.
You know,

870
00:38:40,810 --> 00:38:41,643
we have the Great Depression and they 
tried all kinds of things to get us out 

871
00:38:44,321 --> 00:38:46,000
of that.
We were still in it.

872
00:38:46,090 --> 00:38:46,923
When the gin up 1942 the second world 
war started and you go look at the 

873
00:38:50,051 --> 00:38:53,890
production numbers and economic numbers 
and the graph is almost straight up,

874
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:57,460
right?
So then in 1943 when it's clear that the

875
00:38:57,461 --> 00:38:59,500
war will be over in a couple of years 
and attorney it,

876
00:38:59,501 --> 00:39:00,930
it's like an arm wrestling match and 
it's,

877
00:39:00,931 --> 00:39:02,800
it's too far ago,
they start thinking,

878
00:39:02,801 --> 00:39:03,634
okay,
well what happens when we turn off the 

879
00:39:04,691 --> 00:39:05,524
spigot?

880
00:39:05,620 --> 00:39:07,120
Right?
Because I had a,

881
00:39:07,121 --> 00:39:11,500
a great uncle who had a small little 
rubber plant in,

882
00:39:11,501 --> 00:39:14,050
in Orange County before the war,
when the war started,

883
00:39:14,051 --> 00:39:17,920
the government gave him a huge amount of
money to buy up all the land.

884
00:39:18,010 --> 00:39:18,970
You know,
we need all the,

885
00:39:18,971 --> 00:39:19,660
you know,
all of it,

886
00:39:19,660 --> 00:39:21,070
right?
And then after the war,

887
00:39:21,071 --> 00:39:22,570
they simply said,
do whatever you want with it.

888
00:39:22,600 --> 00:39:24,820
So he sold it and made a fortune just on
selling the land.

889
00:39:25,060 --> 00:39:26,920
But that's the Spigot,
right?

890
00:39:26,921 --> 00:39:27,754
That's the tech.
So there was this feeling that we could 

891
00:39:29,741 --> 00:39:32,890
go right back to the great depression if
you didn't keep the spigot on right.

892
00:39:32,891 --> 00:39:33,724
The,
this unnatural amount of cash coming 

893
00:39:35,471 --> 00:39:39,760
from taxpayers to military to build 
stuff that we might not even need,

894
00:39:40,210 --> 00:39:42,400
but it keeps jobs going.
That's the thing.

895
00:39:42,401 --> 00:39:43,234
If I told you that we could get out of 
all these countries in the world would 

896
00:39:45,641 --> 00:39:46,180
be fine.

897
00:39:46,180 --> 00:39:47,470
You might say,
that sounds great,

898
00:39:47,530 --> 00:39:50,860
but if I said yes,
but we could also lose 250,000

899
00:39:50,861 --> 00:39:53,720
jobs to people in the defense,
it then when you'd have to say it right,

900
00:39:53,730 --> 00:39:55,990
is it,
but then one must ask,

901
00:39:56,440 --> 00:39:59,680
are these real jobs or these jobs where 
you know,

902
00:39:59,681 --> 00:40:00,514
Dave Rubin's tax dollars basically 
transferred to a guy who works in the 

903
00:40:03,191 --> 00:40:04,024
defense.
I mean,

904
00:40:04,330 --> 00:40:06,970
and is that really capitalism?
You know we,

905
00:40:06,971 --> 00:40:07,804
we,
we go after the socialist countries for 

906
00:40:09,311 --> 00:40:11,590
being socialist.
How different is it?

907
00:40:11,591 --> 00:40:13,600
Military keynesianism is a kind of a 
socialist,

908
00:40:13,910 --> 00:40:14,743
right?
We're just transferring it in a 

909
00:40:15,491 --> 00:40:17,440
different and then when we don't want 
the stuff,

910
00:40:17,500 --> 00:40:18,251
this is where,
you know,

911
00:40:18,251 --> 00:40:21,930
it's a bit of a shell game because if we
were really concerned with defense,

912
00:40:21,940 --> 00:40:24,640
you would not give your best equipment 
to other people.

913
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:25,713
Right?
You would not say this is our new m one 

914
00:40:27,251 --> 00:40:28,084
Abrams tank and we have it,
but then when you give it to other 

915
00:40:29,711 --> 00:40:30,670
people,
what does that mean?

916
00:40:30,670 --> 00:40:32,680
That means they have the same stuff you 
do,

917
00:40:32,681 --> 00:40:33,514
which means you've got to go build 
better stuff so it becomes a make work 

918
00:40:37,361 --> 00:40:38,194
program if you will.
So how much of it is just that that 

919
00:40:40,511 --> 00:40:41,344
maybe this thing has grown so big?
I'm talking about budgets and military 

920
00:40:45,071 --> 00:40:45,904
and all that.
That t reigning it back in would almost 

921
00:40:49,631 --> 00:40:52,630
be impossible short of something 
completely radical.

922
00:40:52,631 --> 00:40:53,464
Like I would probably be four,
I'd have to think it out a little bit 

923
00:40:55,841 --> 00:40:57,220
further and sit down with some economist
on it.

924
00:40:57,310 --> 00:40:58,143
I would probably be for like a 20% cut 
across the entire board for the 

925
00:41:01,631 --> 00:41:02,464
government just to just cut every 
department back 20% mostly because of 

926
00:41:06,011 --> 00:41:06,844
the bloat and the bureaucracy because I 
think you could easily get 20% out of 

927
00:41:09,671 --> 00:41:10,504
almost everything.
But do you think it's possible that 

928
00:41:11,801 --> 00:41:12,634
we've maybe gotten too big,
that somehow turning it back could have 

929
00:41:17,020 --> 00:41:18,520
repercussions that we can't even 
imagine?

930
00:41:18,580 --> 00:41:19,181
Well,
first of all,

931
00:41:19,181 --> 00:41:22,210
start with when you have a corrupt 
political system,

932
00:41:22,930 --> 00:41:25,420
take for example the question of tanks.
We just brought up tanks.

933
00:41:25,421 --> 00:41:26,254
Well,
there's a famous story happened on all 

934
00:41:26,910 --> 00:41:27,743
six months,
a year ago where it was a bit of a 

935
00:41:29,651 --> 00:41:32,090
scandal because the government doesn't 
want any more time.

936
00:41:32,100 --> 00:41:34,520
Military did not want any more tanks.
We have lots of them,

937
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:35,833
but they build tanks.
It important districts that have 

938
00:41:37,191 --> 00:41:39,540
senators who then go and argue that,
you know,

939
00:41:39,920 --> 00:41:42,380
you would decimate my local economy if 
we weren't building.

940
00:41:42,500 --> 00:41:43,333
So they're building more tanks than the 
military says they want because we have 

941
00:41:45,981 --> 00:41:48,140
to keep the work.
See the military also smart,

942
00:41:48,440 --> 00:41:51,290
they locate a,
and I love the u s military by the way,

943
00:41:51,291 --> 00:41:52,880
I'm a military history guy,
but,

944
00:41:52,881 --> 00:41:53,714
but they locate the various important 
facilities in places where there are 

945
00:41:57,021 --> 00:42:00,740
powerful politicians and what happened?
So you have a real reason.

946
00:42:00,741 --> 00:42:02,090
I mean if you talk about cutting 
defense,

947
00:42:02,091 --> 00:42:03,290
you're going to have,
for example,

948
00:42:03,350 --> 00:42:04,183
congressmen down in southern California 
who have marine bases that depend on 

949
00:42:08,001 --> 00:42:08,834
that money,
that feed families that go into the 

950
00:42:10,191 --> 00:42:12,170
local economies.
But again,

951
00:42:12,470 --> 00:42:14,780
do you have a Defense Department for 
that?

952
00:42:14,930 --> 00:42:17,210
Is that what you,
and and if you got rid of that,

953
00:42:17,330 --> 00:42:19,430
does that mean you will suffer or does 
that mean,

954
00:42:19,460 --> 00:42:19,781
you know,
the,

955
00:42:19,781 --> 00:42:21,620
the true believers in capitalism would 
say,

956
00:42:21,621 --> 00:42:23,450
okay,
you will reallocate all that,

957
00:42:23,480 --> 00:42:24,920
right?
If you believe that,

958
00:42:24,921 --> 00:42:26,420
and you know,
I'm more of a pragmatist,

959
00:42:26,421 --> 00:42:27,540
it's an ideology,
but,

960
00:42:27,560 --> 00:42:30,920
but those funds will be relocated to 
more productive measures will be form of

961
00:42:30,921 --> 00:42:32,450
creative destruction,
if you will.

962
00:42:32,750 --> 00:42:34,810
Um,
I think that's,

963
00:42:34,820 --> 00:42:36,320
that's a,
a more logical question.

964
00:42:36,321 --> 00:42:39,380
Like if you talk about cutting the 
defense budget for example,

965
00:42:39,381 --> 00:42:41,690
by 20%.
The problem with that is you haven't cut

966
00:42:41,691 --> 00:42:42,524
the mission.
If your job is to be the global 

967
00:42:44,481 --> 00:42:47,630
policeman of the world,
we're not spending enough now.

968
00:42:47,990 --> 00:42:49,930
So you have to match the funding.

969
00:42:50,110 --> 00:42:51,440
Well,
I would argue that's a problem too,

970
00:42:51,710 --> 00:42:53,560
you guys,
I think you have to match the funding

971
00:42:53,670 --> 00:42:54,720
to the mission,
right?

972
00:42:54,870 --> 00:42:57,330
If our job is to defend the United 
States of America,

973
00:42:57,331 --> 00:42:59,940
we are wildly spending too much money.
Right?

974
00:43:00,090 --> 00:43:00,690
Okay.
So,

975
00:43:00,690 --> 00:43:02,920
so here's the thing that never gets 
debated.

976
00:43:02,921 --> 00:43:03,310
And then,
you know,

977
00:43:03,310 --> 00:43:05,760
it's like the dog that didn't bark and 
Sherlock Holmes,

978
00:43:05,770 --> 00:43:06,603
the subject we never debate is allowing 
the American people a voice in the 

979
00:43:09,871 --> 00:43:10,704
foreign policy.
Because if the American people are 

980
00:43:12,451 --> 00:43:13,284
allowed to decide the foreign policy,
we don't have this foreign policy and 

981
00:43:15,900 --> 00:43:16,733
everybody knows it.
That's why we don't have a voice in 

982
00:43:19,291 --> 00:43:20,730
that.
So that's why we have,

983
00:43:20,790 --> 00:43:21,840
and,
and it's the one thing,

984
00:43:21,841 --> 00:43:22,674
you know,
do you want to say one thing about 

985
00:43:23,281 --> 00:43:24,114
president trump?
He's probably kept more campaign 

986
00:43:25,321 --> 00:43:26,154
promises that any president I can think 
of whether you want those promises are 

987
00:43:28,891 --> 00:43:29,724
not,
but the one he's pivoting on is the 

988
00:43:31,351 --> 00:43:32,550
foreign policy promise.

989
00:43:32,750 --> 00:43:35,810
So the former policy problem is 
basically people thought he was going to

990
00:43:35,811 --> 00:43:39,440
be more of an isolationist and now don't
use that term.

991
00:43:39,860 --> 00:43:42,080
That's a slur.
You're playing right into it.

992
00:43:42,830 --> 00:43:44,510
Well that he's,
that he was not,

993
00:43:44,540 --> 00:43:46,250
he didn't run on war,
let's put it that way.

994
00:43:46,280 --> 00:43:47,113
He said we're wasting,
a lot of mine are more like other 

995
00:43:48,801 --> 00:43:50,850
countries for empowerment.
Right.

996
00:43:50,960 --> 00:43:53,330
Which I guess in the American or hyper 
intervention,

997
00:43:53,331 --> 00:43:54,500
right.
So the American Lens,

998
00:43:54,501 --> 00:43:56,240
it comes out as if you're in isolation.
It's,

999
00:43:56,241 --> 00:44:01,070
but just take care of the hyper 
interventionists country anymore.

1000
00:44:01,420 --> 00:44:03,710
But you suspect that he's actually 
shifting on that.

1001
00:44:03,770 --> 00:44:04,603
The powers,
I don't think he's doing it because he 

1002
00:44:06,861 --> 00:44:09,260
lied.
I think you get in there and you don't,

1003
00:44:09,320 --> 00:44:11,110
the inertia that,
that,

1004
00:44:11,120 --> 00:44:11,770
that,
that,

1005
00:44:11,770 --> 00:44:13,160
that,
that gets on you.

1006
00:44:13,430 --> 00:44:14,151
I mean,
for example,

1007
00:44:14,151 --> 00:44:15,830
the Russian thing is fun to watch.
I mean,

1008
00:44:15,831 --> 00:44:20,831
because there's no reason for us to be 
at odds with Russia.

1009
00:44:20,961 --> 00:44:22,180
And they'll say,
completely agree.

1010
00:44:23,940 --> 00:44:24,560
Okay,
what,

1011
00:44:24,560 --> 00:44:25,620
what,
what we're going to depend,

1012
00:44:25,650 --> 00:44:27,650
these leaders now have to be nice.
He's a bad guy.

1013
00:44:27,700 --> 00:44:28,533
I don't think he's a good guy.
But that doesn't mean you get into a 

1014
00:44:31,171 --> 00:44:32,160
nuclear war

1015
00:44:32,160 --> 00:44:33,960
over some miscalculation.
I mean,

1016
00:44:34,230 --> 00:44:36,840
listen,
you have international competitors,

1017
00:44:37,950 --> 00:44:41,250
but that's light.
And if your job is as our military,

1018
00:44:41,251 --> 00:44:41,851
um,
you know,

1019
00:44:41,851 --> 00:44:42,180
we have,
uh,

1020
00:44:42,180 --> 00:44:42,570
we have,
uh,

1021
00:44:42,570 --> 00:44:44,030
you,
I need to explain this.

1022
00:44:44,190 --> 00:44:46,650
We have a policy and they updated all 
the time,

1023
00:44:46,670 --> 00:44:48,980
a giant sort of global policy on,
on,

1024
00:44:48,981 --> 00:44:50,910
on our plans for the next 10 years,
20 years.

1025
00:44:51,210 --> 00:44:52,043
And our main goal these policies say,
is to have no international military 

1026
00:44:55,921 --> 00:44:57,540
competitors.
None.

1027
00:44:58,200 --> 00:45:02,220
If that's your foreign policy goals,
you are leading to confrontation.

1028
00:45:02,250 --> 00:45:03,083
I mean,
that ends in confrontation and it 

1029
00:45:03,961 --> 00:45:04,794
requires an enormous amount of spending 
because our old goal used to be to be 

1030
00:45:07,981 --> 00:45:12,090
able to fight two wars on opposite sides
of the planet at the same time.

1031
00:45:13,050 --> 00:45:16,950
Who else has a cost?
So the argument,

1032
00:45:17,220 --> 00:45:20,370
I read Charles Krauthammer who I dislike
intensely,

1033
00:45:20,430 --> 00:45:21,780
um,
the other day and he said,

1034
00:45:21,781 --> 00:45:25,200
what makes America great is global 
leadership.

1035
00:45:25,350 --> 00:45:26,183
In other words,
I guess we weren't great before 1945 

1036
00:45:29,100 --> 00:45:31,110
but,
but when you think like that,

1037
00:45:31,410 --> 00:45:32,580
then the only,
it's not freedom.

1038
00:45:32,581 --> 00:45:34,260
It's not liberty,
it's not the constitution,

1039
00:45:34,261 --> 00:45:36,600
it's that we are the policemen of the 
world and we're the big dog.

1040
00:45:36,601 --> 00:45:38,520
And once we lose that,
we're no longer great.

1041
00:45:38,910 --> 00:45:41,970
How the heck did we ever survive up 
until the second world war?

1042
00:45:42,110 --> 00:45:42,943
All right,
so this strikes me as a good segue to 

1043
00:45:44,341 --> 00:45:46,110
history.
Can you talk about history?

1044
00:45:46,111 --> 00:45:47,070
Carlin?
Not,

1045
00:45:47,100 --> 00:45:47,850
um,
not,

1046
00:45:47,850 --> 00:45:50,370
not with qualifications,
but just as a fan.

1047
00:45:50,670 --> 00:45:52,890
So you're technically,
you're not a historian.

1048
00:45:52,891 --> 00:45:55,320
I know you're up front about that,
but you're hardcore history.

1049
00:45:55,321 --> 00:45:56,154
You do an incredible job of basically 
storytelling history with a little 

1050
00:46:00,721 --> 00:46:01,554
present day context.
Do you see that as sort of the best way 

1051
00:46:04,231 --> 00:46:08,250
to get people to understand history?
It started off as a show for fans,

1052
00:46:08,251 --> 00:46:09,084
which is what I am.

1053
00:46:09,210 --> 00:46:11,370
I have a history degree,
but it's a simple ba and,

1054
00:46:11,371 --> 00:46:13,020
and we used to do these shows where I 
would just,

1055
00:46:13,320 --> 00:46:14,153
I assumed that the audience understood 
the story and so we were just talking 

1056
00:46:16,861 --> 00:46:17,694
about the weird things in the story.
I mean I think the first show we ever 

1057
00:46:19,621 --> 00:46:20,454
did was 15 or 20 minutes and of course 
the last one I just did was six hours 

1058
00:46:23,340 --> 00:46:24,173
and so you can see I never would have 
done it if I'd known it was going to be 

1059
00:46:25,891 --> 00:46:26,724
six hours long or multipart episodes,
but then people would write us and it 

1060
00:46:29,131 --> 00:46:31,080
wasn't the audience.
I thought it was going to pay attention.

1061
00:46:31,081 --> 00:46:31,914
They would say I liked those twists or 
what we call Lou twilight zone musings 

1062
00:46:36,240 --> 00:46:38,280
and they said like those,
but I don't know the background.

1063
00:46:38,281 --> 00:46:40,740
Can you give me more background in is as
you well know,

1064
00:46:40,741 --> 00:46:43,920
and I always say Seinfeld wasn't 
Seinfeld for the first 10 episodes.

1065
00:46:44,010 --> 00:46:44,843
Every show has to sort of evolve into 
what it's going to be and we started 

1066
00:46:47,611 --> 00:46:49,950
evolving towards giving a little bit 
more information,

1067
00:46:49,951 --> 00:46:50,784
then a little bit more information.
Then we had to find out how a non 

1068
00:46:54,050 --> 00:46:54,883
academically qualified person can 
transmit this story in a way where you 

1069
00:46:58,411 --> 00:47:01,720
could reasonably think you could trust 
it and I,

1070
00:47:01,760 --> 00:47:03,930
I came up with something we call in shop
anyway,

1071
00:47:03,960 --> 00:47:06,000
audio footnotes,
which is okay.

1072
00:47:06,001 --> 00:47:06,834
Carlin says something.
Then I back it up with something that a 

1073
00:47:09,331 --> 00:47:10,164
historian says and then we point out 
which has turned out to be one of the 

1074
00:47:11,851 --> 00:47:12,684
most fun things of the program for 
listeners that historians don't agree 

1075
00:47:15,570 --> 00:47:18,000
because listeners always assumed some of
them anyway,

1076
00:47:18,150 --> 00:47:21,630
that there was a history and that that's
how it was to find out that history is a

1077
00:47:21,631 --> 00:47:23,820
little bit more like from 500 years from
now,

1078
00:47:23,821 --> 00:47:24,654
somebody having an msnbc or Fox News 
version of that that turned on a lot of 

1079
00:47:28,960 --> 00:47:30,340
them.
And so the show evolved

1080
00:47:30,340 --> 00:47:31,173
into what it is now,
which part of what it does is show you 

1081
00:47:32,801 --> 00:47:35,200
how we call it historiography in the 
history,

1082
00:47:35,260 --> 00:47:37,540
but how history is put together and how 
they sort of,

1083
00:47:37,570 --> 00:47:39,350
and how it can change over time.
And,

1084
00:47:39,580 --> 00:47:41,860
and so what was the original question,
Dave?

1085
00:47:41,861 --> 00:47:42,641
Well,
I'll shift.

1086
00:47:42,641 --> 00:47:43,710
I should be,
I think he got,

1087
00:47:43,720 --> 00:47:46,300
I think it basically got it there,
but I'll shift to this,

1088
00:47:46,301 --> 00:47:47,134
which is how I started at the top of the
show that I am a firm believer that 

1089
00:47:49,871 --> 00:47:50,704
history repeats itself,
which is why what I think you're doing 

1090
00:47:52,361 --> 00:47:53,194
is so irrelevant.
Is there something historical that we 

1091
00:47:56,141 --> 00:47:58,780
can look to for our politics right now 
and go,

1092
00:47:59,200 --> 00:48:00,430
yeah,
it was Kinda like that.

1093
00:48:01,270 --> 00:48:02,103
Or are we,
is trump really thrown in such a 

1094
00:48:04,031 --> 00:48:07,360
wildcard here that there's nothing we 
can look and go?

1095
00:48:07,510 --> 00:48:08,710
It's kind of close to that.

1096
00:48:09,460 --> 00:48:10,420
I've always had,
I don't think his,

1097
00:48:10,421 --> 00:48:11,650
you know,
the Mark Twain,

1098
00:48:11,651 --> 00:48:13,510
I think it was mark Twain who said 
history doesn't repeat itself,

1099
00:48:13,511 --> 00:48:15,460
but it sometimes rhymes.
Um,

1100
00:48:15,820 --> 00:48:16,930
it's,
it's not that,

1101
00:48:17,020 --> 00:48:17,853
it's not that history is so cyclical.
It's that there's a constant element in 

1102
00:48:21,521 --> 00:48:23,510
it and it's us,
right?

1103
00:48:23,530 --> 00:48:25,690
It's human beings.
What did Shakespeare say?

1104
00:48:25,691 --> 00:48:27,280
You know,
all the world's a stage and all the,

1105
00:48:27,470 --> 00:48:28,230
uh,
all the people,

1106
00:48:28,230 --> 00:48:31,270
merely players,
the tapestries change.

1107
00:48:31,540 --> 00:48:33,400
But if you could pull people out of the 
past,

1108
00:48:33,460 --> 00:48:34,293
other than the fact that they're going 
to seem like different cultures because 

1109
00:48:35,861 --> 00:48:37,450
they were raised in completely different
environments,

1110
00:48:37,630 --> 00:48:39,070
there's still people,
right?

1111
00:48:39,071 --> 00:48:41,590
If you measured them with,
with sensory equipment,

1112
00:48:41,591 --> 00:48:43,270
they're going to,
they're going to score the same.

1113
00:48:43,480 --> 00:48:45,790
And so that's why it seems similar.
So when you look back,

1114
00:48:45,791 --> 00:48:48,220
for example,
at the fall of the Roman republic,

1115
00:48:48,221 --> 00:48:49,360
you have two things that are similar.

1116
00:48:49,360 --> 00:48:50,193
One human being,
so with the same passions and desires 

1117
00:48:52,960 --> 00:48:55,840
and foibles and all that,
and then you have systems.

1118
00:48:56,050 --> 00:48:57,910
So the reason people always look at 
Rome,

1119
00:48:57,940 --> 00:48:58,773
the Republican,
everybody thinks empire and it's the 

1120
00:48:59,771 --> 00:49:00,604
public that's similar is because when 
you have a government that is formed 

1121
00:49:04,121 --> 00:49:06,310
because ours was deliberately modeled on
some of those.

1122
00:49:06,610 --> 00:49:07,443
Um,
so you have a similar system and then 

1123
00:49:08,471 --> 00:49:09,304
you throw human beings into it,
you're going to see things that are 

1124
00:49:11,621 --> 00:49:14,020
similar because there are patterns that 
are going to reemerge.

1125
00:49:14,260 --> 00:49:17,410
Does that give you any predictive value?
Absolutely not.

1126
00:49:17,470 --> 00:49:19,000
Right?
That history doesn't teach you how,

1127
00:49:19,120 --> 00:49:20,290
for example,
I love the,

1128
00:49:20,380 --> 00:49:21,920
the right wing always tells you that,
you know,

1129
00:49:21,921 --> 00:49:23,980
the Hitler and Munich and appeasement 
taught you.

1130
00:49:24,190 --> 00:49:25,090
You can't do that.
No,

1131
00:49:25,091 --> 00:49:25,924
it doesn't.
It taught you what you can do with 

1132
00:49:26,381 --> 00:49:30,250
Hitler in that situation,
that the variables mess that up.

1133
00:49:30,310 --> 00:49:31,143
So history doesn't teach you how to act,
but it can tell you a lot about who we 

1134
00:49:34,061 --> 00:49:36,250
are.
So it's basically,

1135
00:49:36,251 --> 00:49:37,084
it's just humans really.
It's just humans within the time frame 

1136
00:49:40,181 --> 00:49:42,070
that they happen to humans and systems.
Right?

1137
00:49:42,071 --> 00:49:42,904
Human Systems and culture.
Because you can take people even now 

1138
00:49:45,371 --> 00:49:47,350
from different cultures.
I mean if you took,

1139
00:49:47,650 --> 00:49:50,620
if you took people from a completely 
different culture right here,

1140
00:49:50,860 --> 00:49:51,693
go to central Africa and replace all the
Americans tomorrow and take them to put 

1141
00:49:55,451 --> 00:49:56,284
them in central Africa to take all of 
the central Africans to put them in the 

1142
00:49:57,791 --> 00:49:59,350
United States and say,
here's your system.

1143
00:49:59,351 --> 00:50:00,184
Donald trumps your president and you 
have a midterm election in two years 

1144
00:50:02,770 --> 00:50:03,603
they're gone.
Do you think there's going to be a few 

1145
00:50:04,751 --> 00:50:05,584
differences in the voting patterns?
And so you have to factor culture 

1146
00:50:08,021 --> 00:50:08,854
systems and us the equation.
But that's why history is important 

1147
00:50:12,611 --> 00:50:13,444
because it really teaches you about us 
as a species through cultures and 

1148
00:50:18,851 --> 00:50:20,560
through time.
Yeah.

1149
00:50:20,580 --> 00:50:21,413
That,
I mean that's a beautiful way to phrase 

1150
00:50:22,091 --> 00:50:24,070
it,
that their historical events you have to

1151
00:50:24,071 --> 00:50:26,440
know about.
But really what you're learning about is

1152
00:50:26,441 --> 00:50:28,160
just sort of the nature of being human.

1153
00:50:28,370 --> 00:50:30,860
And that's argued,
but is there a human nature?

1154
00:50:31,220 --> 00:50:32,450
But certainly,
I mean,

1155
00:50:32,480 --> 00:50:33,313
we have parameters within which most of 
us operate and whether the culture 

1156
00:50:37,791 --> 00:50:40,430
expands those parameters over time,
there's still,

1157
00:50:40,550 --> 00:50:41,690
I mean,
love is love,

1158
00:50:41,691 --> 00:50:43,280
hate is hate,
sexist sex.

1159
00:50:43,281 --> 00:50:44,114
I mean there's certain things that,
I mean we see the similarities in 

1160
00:50:47,571 --> 00:50:49,490
primates when you look at them now,
so,

1161
00:50:49,610 --> 00:50:50,443
so that's what connects you to an 
ancient Egyptian where almost nothing 

1162
00:50:53,361 --> 00:50:54,460
else would,
right?

1163
00:50:54,500 --> 00:50:55,970
Yeah,
they're still people.

1164
00:50:55,971 --> 00:50:58,070
And when you read,
for example,

1165
00:50:58,220 --> 00:51:03,220
the epitaphs that the ancient Romans 
wrote on the equivalent of tombstones of

1166
00:51:03,471 --> 00:51:07,070
their children who died,
it touches your heart today.

1167
00:51:07,071 --> 00:51:07,904
The way you can relate and the only 
reason you can relate is because if you 

1168
00:51:10,821 --> 00:51:11,654
took a Roman baby and put him in a time 
machine and brought him now and raised 

1169
00:51:15,411 --> 00:51:16,244
him as one of us,
he would be indistinguishable and vice 

1170
00:51:18,111 --> 00:51:18,944
versa.
You would like watching public 

1171
00:51:20,691 --> 00:51:21,524
executions for entertainment.
If I took you as a child and raised you 

1172
00:51:24,261 --> 00:51:25,520
back in the Middle Ages.
Yeah,

1173
00:51:26,090 --> 00:51:27,980
I'm pretty sure we're going to get back 
to that too.

1174
00:51:27,990 --> 00:51:29,290
I mean,
you've ever seen,

1175
00:51:29,730 --> 00:51:34,130
we do know exactly.
We're not that far from it.

1176
00:51:34,131 --> 00:51:34,570
You know,
we,

1177
00:51:34,570 --> 00:51:35,300
we really are.
And,

1178
00:51:35,300 --> 00:51:36,560
and by the way,
there are parts of the world,

1179
00:51:36,561 --> 00:51:37,394
Saudi Arabia,
they're beheading people on the streets 

1180
00:51:38,661 --> 00:51:40,610
and plenty of people watch and cheer and
all that.

1181
00:51:40,760 --> 00:51:43,310
Are they that much different than us or 
is their system,

1182
00:51:43,520 --> 00:51:46,760
and I guess that's what you would argue 
the system around them has just led them

1183
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:48,710
to cheering that right.
It's not true.

1184
00:51:49,110 --> 00:51:49,943
Yeah.
Cultural systems systems lock you in 

1185
00:51:51,501 --> 00:51:54,410
like a republic locks you into certain 
things.

1186
00:51:54,411 --> 00:51:55,850
For example,
in Rome,

1187
00:51:55,851 --> 00:51:56,840
the part that just,
you know,

1188
00:51:56,890 --> 00:51:58,160
you look at it and you just go,
gosh,

1189
00:51:58,161 --> 00:51:58,994
it looks so similar as a campaign.
Contributions and money and favors with 

1190
00:52:01,581 --> 00:52:02,414
powerful people.
And the ability of the powerful to 

1191
00:52:04,461 --> 00:52:05,191
influence,
I mean,

1192
00:52:05,191 --> 00:52:06,024
the,
the wonderful part of Roman republic 

1193
00:52:07,311 --> 00:52:10,100
history for me is when you,
when you read about the,

1194
00:52:10,270 --> 00:52:12,480
the attempts,
for example,

1195
00:52:12,481 --> 00:52:14,290
of the people who were known as the 
[inaudible],

1196
00:52:14,330 --> 00:52:16,700
the groggy brothers are famous as the,
as the,

1197
00:52:16,820 --> 00:52:19,730
you would call them the champions of the
poor today.

1198
00:52:19,760 --> 00:52:22,220
Maybe like you would say the Bernie 
Sanders types or whatever.

1199
00:52:22,610 --> 00:52:23,443
But what I love about reading the Roman 
history and Rome is great because you 

1200
00:52:25,731 --> 00:52:26,564
have so much history that you can 
actually look at and study is that the 

1201
00:52:28,791 --> 00:52:32,360
people at the time would say that's not 
what they really believe.

1202
00:52:32,360 --> 00:52:35,430
They're just trying to,
it sounds so good.

1203
00:52:35,431 --> 00:52:38,390
Were being paid off by the Koch brothers
and so when you read it,

1204
00:52:38,391 --> 00:52:40,010
you just go,
that's a systems thing,

1205
00:52:40,011 --> 00:52:40,844
right?
Their system looks like our system and 

1206
00:52:42,981 --> 00:52:46,760
because of that you throw human beings 
as they always are into that system.

1207
00:52:47,150 --> 00:52:49,160
The culture part is what makes it very 
different,

1208
00:52:49,340 --> 00:52:52,550
but I mean you can see echoes of who we 
still are today.

1209
00:52:52,670 --> 00:52:54,160
Is it,
is it a predictive tool?

1210
00:52:54,190 --> 00:52:56,360
Not at all.
But you do look at it and you go,

1211
00:52:56,361 --> 00:52:57,194
Gosh,
we are interesting animals and I see it 

1212
00:52:59,751 --> 00:53:01,640
over thousands of years of difference.

1213
00:53:01,770 --> 00:53:02,603
Yeah.
I feel this question may come off a 

1214
00:53:03,451 --> 00:53:04,284
little,
a little too easy or a little too 

1215
00:53:05,791 --> 00:53:06,624
cliche,
but are there a couple leaders 

1216
00:53:09,300 --> 00:53:13,920
throughout time that you look at it as 
like truly special in their time?

1217
00:53:14,400 --> 00:53:16,770
Oh,
this is everything that you've said.

1218
00:53:16,771 --> 00:53:17,604
Making sense.
Like accepting that a lot of it's human 

1219
00:53:18,931 --> 00:53:21,330
nature and the time they live in and the
system they live in and all that.

1220
00:53:21,331 --> 00:53:22,164
But were there a couple that somehow,
or even one that just somehow within 

1221
00:53:25,351 --> 00:53:26,040
that moment

1222
00:53:26,040 --> 00:53:28,980
did something truly special?
See Age old question,

1223
00:53:28,981 --> 00:53:29,701
right.
How much,

1224
00:53:29,701 --> 00:53:30,534
uh,
how much do the leaders push things 

1225
00:53:31,891 --> 00:53:32,724
versus how much do the trends and forces
of the time period created an opening 

1226
00:53:35,371 --> 00:53:36,900
that someone fills?
I mean,

1227
00:53:36,930 --> 00:53:39,660
trump is the perfect example of a trends
and forces guy.

1228
00:53:40,080 --> 00:53:40,913
I mean we have a situation here where a 
vacuum was created that someone was 

1229
00:53:43,501 --> 00:53:45,630
going to step into and he walked into 
it.

1230
00:53:45,631 --> 00:53:47,490
He didn't push this,
he didn't make this,

1231
00:53:47,610 --> 00:53:48,443
he,
he benefited from it and he took 

1232
00:53:49,411 --> 00:53:50,244
advantage of it.
He's the beneficiary of the trends and 

1233
00:53:51,931 --> 00:53:53,490
forces that,
as we said earlier,

1234
00:53:53,610 --> 00:53:55,860
had been 40 or 50 years at least in the 
making.

1235
00:53:56,160 --> 00:53:57,660
Do you think he didn't push it at all?
I mean,

1236
00:53:57,661 --> 00:54:00,560
some of the tactics that he think it 
really was.

1237
00:54:00,561 --> 00:54:02,560
Yeah.
And I think that's why he has to have a,

1238
00:54:02,650 --> 00:54:05,160
the advisers he does to try to keep him 
in touch with the,

1239
00:54:05,310 --> 00:54:06,800
with the current trends as they are in.

1240
00:54:06,900 --> 00:54:07,733
And not just the current trends society,
but the current trends amongst the 

1241
00:54:09,871 --> 00:54:11,400
people who are his supporters.
Right.

1242
00:54:11,580 --> 00:54:12,780
He has to ask,
you know,

1243
00:54:12,781 --> 00:54:13,890
Bannon,
uh,

1244
00:54:13,920 --> 00:54:16,710
how will this play amongst the,
because he doesn't know.

1245
00:54:16,711 --> 00:54:17,544
I truly believe if you look at trump,
we always thought trump was either a 

1246
00:54:20,581 --> 00:54:23,160
centrist democrat or a centrist 
Republican.

1247
00:54:23,370 --> 00:54:24,203
For him to have the most right wing 
administration in anyone's memory is a 

1248
00:54:27,811 --> 00:54:28,644
bit of a shock.
But he was able to read the lay of the 

1249
00:54:31,171 --> 00:54:36,171
land and know that there was this crowd 
that had been created by the dynamics of

1250
00:54:36,961 --> 00:54:40,390
the last 40 or,
and the anger over the situation that,

1251
00:54:40,450 --> 00:54:43,260
that he could play to that.
Now he doesn't know intrinsically how to

1252
00:54:43,261 --> 00:54:44,490
play to that.
Cause that's not him.

1253
00:54:44,491 --> 00:54:45,720
He has to ask,
right?

1254
00:54:45,900 --> 00:54:47,310
How will this move,
you know,

1255
00:54:47,311 --> 00:54:48,144
react.
So,

1256
00:54:48,180 --> 00:54:49,890
so he's a trends and forces guy.

1257
00:54:49,890 --> 00:54:51,930
When you look at people that push the 
envelope,

1258
00:54:52,800 --> 00:54:56,730
you look for people who are wildly 
different.

1259
00:54:56,731 --> 00:54:59,850
And that doesn't mean good necessarily.
It's just,

1260
00:55:00,030 --> 00:55:02,340
I mean,
I'm always impressed with the geniuses.

1261
00:55:02,370 --> 00:55:03,203
That doesn't mean that that a guy like 
Julius Caesar did not benefit from the 

1262
00:55:06,391 --> 00:55:08,190
trends and forces of his time because he
did.

1263
00:55:08,670 --> 00:55:11,910
But when you read about a guy like 
Caesar and you find out that he was able

1264
00:55:12,090 --> 00:55:15,180
to sit there in his litter going from 
place to place,

1265
00:55:15,420 --> 00:55:18,570
dictating three letters at the same 
time,

1266
00:55:18,720 --> 00:55:19,650
I mean,
and you sit there and go,

1267
00:55:19,680 --> 00:55:21,480
well that's a really unusual human 
being.

1268
00:55:21,750 --> 00:55:24,510
So you put those human beings in certain
situations and you'd say,

1269
00:55:24,511 --> 00:55:25,344
okay,
that situation turned out in a way that 

1270
00:55:26,821 --> 00:55:29,340
it never would have turned out had it 
not been for that person.

1271
00:55:29,700 --> 00:55:30,533
So there's always an interplay between 
the trends and forces and the 

1272
00:55:33,301 --> 00:55:34,740
individuals who are exploiting them.

1273
00:55:35,040 --> 00:55:37,110
It's hard always to separate the line 
and say,

1274
00:55:37,111 --> 00:55:37,944
okay,
that happened because of that guy or 

1275
00:55:39,751 --> 00:55:41,100
that woman.
Um,

1276
00:55:41,120 --> 00:55:44,130
so when you say historical figures that,
that I,

1277
00:55:44,131 --> 00:55:45,420
um,
oh,

1278
00:55:45,421 --> 00:55:48,600
I gravitate toward the horrible people 
and I don't know why.

1279
00:55:48,990 --> 00:55:49,823
Um,
but you look at Alexander the Great's 

1280
00:55:51,481 --> 00:55:52,314
the one I always look out because to me,
even with all the hyperbole and there's 

1281
00:55:55,531 --> 00:55:57,390
a ton,
he fascinates me.

1282
00:55:57,391 --> 00:55:58,224
He fascinates me because of even the 
different views that historians have 

1283
00:56:00,601 --> 00:56:02,910
over him.
Either he was the enlightened,

1284
00:56:03,180 --> 00:56:04,013
a example of a,
of a philosopher king or he was a total 

1285
00:56:06,901 --> 00:56:09,390
butcher who's been totally mythologized 
later on.

1286
00:56:09,570 --> 00:56:10,403
And,
and to be able to examine the many 

1287
00:56:12,211 --> 00:56:13,044
facets.
I mean,

1288
00:56:13,290 --> 00:56:16,710
imagine yourself in a situation where 
500 or a thousand years from now,

1289
00:56:16,860 --> 00:56:17,693
somebody on one hand is trying to 
explain you and they're taking all of 

1290
00:56:21,031 --> 00:56:23,040
your qualities that are the best of you.

1291
00:56:23,140 --> 00:56:26,290
And,
and portraying Dave Ruben as that,

1292
00:56:26,620 --> 00:56:27,850
but then the other hour,
okay.

1293
00:56:27,851 --> 00:56:31,060
But then the other person takes all of 
the qualities of the worst of you,

1294
00:56:31,390 --> 00:56:33,580
creates a finger or a version of you 
that's,

1295
00:56:33,850 --> 00:56:34,660
and,
and,

1296
00:56:34,660 --> 00:56:38,230
and then multi versions in between that.
That's why I can't,

1297
00:56:38,290 --> 00:56:40,150
so when you say the most fascinating 
people,

1298
00:56:40,151 --> 00:56:40,984
sometimes it's not what they did,
but it's the many versions of them that 

1299
00:56:44,921 --> 00:56:45,850
you see.
Right.

1300
00:56:45,851 --> 00:56:48,310
The mini holograms of Alexander the 
Great and,

1301
00:56:48,580 --> 00:56:50,620
and dressed up in all the different 
forms.

1302
00:56:50,890 --> 00:56:52,330
Evil,
terrible guy,

1303
00:56:52,450 --> 00:56:52,991
Greg.
You know,

1304
00:56:52,991 --> 00:56:53,824
so,
so I'm moved by the figures that are 

1305
00:56:55,691 --> 00:56:56,524
larger than life and a,
and I enjoy watching how they'd been 

1306
00:56:59,231 --> 00:57:01,210
mythologized you.
Cause I think we do that today.

1307
00:57:01,360 --> 00:57:02,440
I think liberals,
for example,

1308
00:57:02,441 --> 00:57:05,200
of mythologized Kennedy,
conservatives in mythologize Reagan,

1309
00:57:05,320 --> 00:57:07,060
I've seen the Reagan thing in my 
lifetime,

1310
00:57:07,061 --> 00:57:07,894
which I considered to be a wonderful 
teaching tool for me to then look and 

1311
00:57:11,321 --> 00:57:11,980
say,
okay,

1312
00:57:11,980 --> 00:57:14,560
I've watched how that happens in it.
So now you can see,

1313
00:57:14,561 --> 00:57:15,394
okay,
it's obviously happened with all these 

1314
00:57:16,211 --> 00:57:17,370
other people in history too.

1315
00:57:17,600 --> 00:57:18,433
Yeah.
So you think it's funny though with the 

1316
00:57:19,561 --> 00:57:20,394
Reagan thing,
it's like he was obviously the hero of 

1317
00:57:22,110 --> 00:57:24,040
the Republicans for the last,
you know,

1318
00:57:24,060 --> 00:57:24,893
30 years and the standard bearer of what
a republican deliberately making 

1319
00:57:27,210 --> 00:57:28,043
conservative,
but then there was this thing in the 

1320
00:57:30,630 --> 00:57:31,463
last year were Democrats were saying a 
lot of Nice things about him because 

1321
00:57:33,391 --> 00:57:35,700
they wanted to prove that trump was not 
him.

1322
00:57:36,290 --> 00:57:40,140
So it was like they took the guy that 
they hated the most to try to trick,

1323
00:57:40,141 --> 00:57:42,180
I guess,
well of

1324
00:57:42,180 --> 00:57:43,500
why it was done.
Right.

1325
00:57:43,501 --> 00:57:46,290
In other words,
we create a metaphor,

1326
00:57:46,440 --> 00:57:47,490
right?
We create,

1327
00:57:47,510 --> 00:57:49,080
uh,
an image and weed and listen,

1328
00:57:49,140 --> 00:57:50,640
we,
we're singling out Reagan,

1329
00:57:50,641 --> 00:57:51,990
but this is the,
this is why I like it.

1330
00:57:51,991 --> 00:57:54,000
It's the human thing to do.
We did it with Alexandra to,

1331
00:57:54,330 --> 00:57:57,030
um,
you take a person and as soon as they're

1332
00:57:57,031 --> 00:57:57,864
gone,
you can easily compress them into a two 

1333
00:57:59,641 --> 00:58:00,474
dimensional version of themselves.
And then you can use them as a symbol 

1334
00:58:02,821 --> 00:58:05,460
for what you want them to represent.
Right?

1335
00:58:05,550 --> 00:58:06,383
And if you could bring these people back
now and show them in there in the 360 

1336
00:58:09,871 --> 00:58:12,330
degrees of the human that they really 
are,

1337
00:58:12,450 --> 00:58:13,283
it'd be,
it'd be,

1338
00:58:13,290 --> 00:58:14,123
it'd be amazing to compare them to the 
mythology that's been created about 

1339
00:58:17,821 --> 00:58:19,800
them.
And when you see it done to one person,

1340
00:58:19,801 --> 00:58:20,634
it allows you then in your mind's eye to
understand how the process works all 

1341
00:58:23,071 --> 00:58:25,380
throughout history and not just with 
good people,

1342
00:58:25,470 --> 00:58:27,360
but sometimes with evil people too.

1343
00:58:27,600 --> 00:58:29,490
I mean,
if you go read mine comp,

1344
00:58:29,880 --> 00:58:30,713
you know,
the very first history show we did was 

1345
00:58:31,921 --> 00:58:32,754
asking whether or not Alexander the 
Great was a better or worse person than 

1346
00:58:35,431 --> 00:58:36,264
Hitler.
And the attitude in it was that if the 

1347
00:58:39,811 --> 00:58:40,970
stories are true,
we'll,

1348
00:58:41,050 --> 00:58:43,350
we'll throw the big asterisk if the 
stories are true.

1349
00:58:43,500 --> 00:58:47,790
Maybe Alexander the Great was killing 
all the people he killed because it made

1350
00:58:47,791 --> 00:58:49,920
Alexander the Great,
a bigger historical figure.

1351
00:58:50,100 --> 00:58:54,480
Whereas when you read mind comp,
Hitler's a twisted human being a product

1352
00:58:54,481 --> 00:58:58,140
of his time,
but he thinks he's doing something good,

1353
00:58:58,180 --> 00:58:59,013
right?
If you think you're doing something 

1354
00:58:59,971 --> 00:59:02,940
good,
does that make you a somewhat less evil?

1355
00:59:02,941 --> 00:59:05,550
That's a good way to put it.
Then the guy who killed all these people

1356
00:59:05,551 --> 00:59:08,550
cause it made him a bigger figure.
So that's a,

1357
00:59:08,560 --> 00:59:10,880
that's a heretical thing to say in a 
blossom.

1358
00:59:10,900 --> 00:59:11,970
This thing to say.
But the point is,

1359
00:59:11,971 --> 00:59:12,804
is that do human beings literally go out
to commit evil or sometimes do they go 

1360
00:59:16,891 --> 00:59:20,970
out to commit good or are these just 
byproducts or mistakes or,

1361
00:59:21,140 --> 00:59:22,910
or accidents of history.

1362
00:59:22,930 --> 00:59:23,571
Right.
And to be clear,

1363
00:59:23,571 --> 00:59:24,404
you're not saying Hitler was good,
you're saying never said Hitler was 

1364
00:59:26,091 --> 00:59:27,860
good.
I'm just going to clean it.

1365
00:59:27,861 --> 00:59:28,820
Look,
I'm going to clear that up.

1366
00:59:28,821 --> 00:59:29,654
Okay.
You're saying that this twisted thing 

1367
00:59:30,981 --> 00:59:33,440
that's,
he himself believed it was good.

1368
00:59:33,590 --> 00:59:34,850
Yeah.
Here's what we need to do.

1369
00:59:34,851 --> 00:59:35,684
We need to get rid of all the Jews cause
it's gonna make things better for 

1370
00:59:37,071 --> 00:59:37,904
everybody.
Does that make him better than the guy 

1371
00:59:38,511 --> 00:59:40,850
that gets rid of all the Jews?
Because the more Jews I killed,

1372
00:59:40,851 --> 00:59:42,170
the bigger figure I am.
Right.

1373
00:59:42,580 --> 00:59:44,450
The whole question is weird.
Right?

1374
00:59:44,451 --> 00:59:45,284
But that's what history allows us to 
play with and ask ourselves as we 

1375
00:59:48,471 --> 00:59:49,304
mythologize change and as many decades 
pass and we forget either the good 

1376
00:59:53,391 --> 00:59:55,370
points or the bad points of these 
figures,

1377
00:59:55,580 --> 00:59:56,413
how do we create a figure that if we 
could go back in time and see them as 

1378
00:59:58,641 --> 00:59:59,474
they really were,
we wouldn't recognize the real figure 

1379
01:00:00,771 --> 01:00:01,490
anymore.

1380
01:00:01,490 --> 01:00:03,200
Kennedy's been mythologized.
I mean,

1381
01:00:03,380 --> 01:00:04,730
this is the guy who served three years 
on,

1382
01:00:04,731 --> 01:00:07,010
often didn't know what I mean other than
the Cuban missile crisis,

1383
01:00:07,011 --> 01:00:09,050
which was crazy how good it performed in
that.

1384
01:00:09,530 --> 01:00:11,630
If you went back and really elected the 
guy today,

1385
01:00:11,631 --> 01:00:13,100
how many liberals would be happy with 
them?

1386
01:00:13,310 --> 01:00:14,143
Just like if you really brought Reagan 
back today and put him in front of 

1387
01:00:16,731 --> 01:00:17,564
conservatives,
he might look like a guy that you 

1388
01:00:19,461 --> 01:00:21,590
wouldn't vote for it because he wasn't 
conservative enough.

1389
01:00:21,620 --> 01:00:21,951
Right.
I,

1390
01:00:21,951 --> 01:00:24,050
that's the funny thing.
I think for Kennedy it would be,

1391
01:00:24,051 --> 01:00:26,510
you'd get some classical liberals and 
conservatives voting for him,

1392
01:00:26,511 --> 01:00:27,750
but the left,
the left.

1393
01:00:28,790 --> 01:00:29,960
That's right.
That's right.

1394
01:00:29,961 --> 01:00:30,470
But,
but,

1395
01:00:30,470 --> 01:00:31,303
but the,
the myth is different and the myths 

1396
01:00:33,171 --> 01:00:34,004
serves purposes.
You're able to put a wonderful bust or 

1397
01:00:36,651 --> 01:00:37,484
you could put a picture of them at your 
convention as look at the wonderful 

1398
01:00:39,681 --> 01:00:41,150
heroes the Democratic Party's had.

1399
01:00:41,150 --> 01:00:42,800
We've had Wilson,
we've had roosevelt,

1400
01:00:43,040 --> 01:00:44,930
but would you want any of them today?
Maybe,

1401
01:00:45,290 --> 01:00:46,123
maybe not.
So it's almost like we need Greek 

1402
01:00:47,451 --> 01:00:50,240
mythology in our,
in our system we need here,

1403
01:00:50,241 --> 01:00:51,074
or we need marvel superheroes or 
something that represent these things 

1404
01:00:53,871 --> 01:00:57,530
because the people behind them are all 
flawed and are screwed up as the rest of

1405
01:00:57,531 --> 01:00:58,780
them.
I mean,

1406
01:00:58,850 --> 01:01:00,380
this is the thing about Martin Luther 
King,

1407
01:01:00,381 --> 01:01:02,540
I always try to explain to people is 
that that here you've,

1408
01:01:02,570 --> 01:01:04,790
you've,
you've created somebody that we can have

1409
01:01:04,791 --> 01:01:05,624
a Martin Luther King Day,
which is like the George Washington 

1410
01:01:07,500 --> 01:01:09,170
chopping the Cherry Tree Down Day,
right?

1411
01:01:09,440 --> 01:01:10,273
People forget Martin Luther King.
You go look at the speeches that he was 

1412
01:01:12,561 --> 01:01:15,530
giving.
He was harsh on the American system,

1413
01:01:15,531 --> 01:01:16,430
right?
What did he say?

1414
01:01:16,470 --> 01:01:19,160
That he's something the focus evil of 
the modern world,

1415
01:01:19,161 --> 01:01:19,994
and forget the exact quote,
but it's one of those things that gets 

1416
01:01:21,441 --> 01:01:25,190
really downplayed when we talk about the
mythology.

1417
01:01:25,190 --> 01:01:26,023
You know that they play up the sides 
that serve the purposes of us now and 

1418
01:01:29,721 --> 01:01:32,390
play down the parts where the man was 
really revolutionary.

1419
01:01:32,391 --> 01:01:33,224
In fact,
my favorite Martin Luther King's 

1420
01:01:34,441 --> 01:01:35,274
speeches or the stuff we never talk 
about anymore because they really edgy 

1421
01:01:38,060 --> 01:01:38,893
but edgy doesn't serve the purpose of 
hero worship and that's how we always 

1422
01:01:42,471 --> 01:01:43,150
are.
Yeah.

1423
01:01:43,150 --> 01:01:43,983
Do you think he evolved that of that 
stuff or also as a just a way to go 

1424
01:01:47,961 --> 01:01:51,440
mainstream to no,
because here's the thing we forget now.

1425
01:01:51,470 --> 01:01:54,320
Mainstream is what?
When when king is marching,

1426
01:01:54,321 --> 01:01:55,154
for example,
we forget that civil rights was not 

1427
01:01:57,771 --> 01:01:59,180
something that everybody was going,
yes,

1428
01:01:59,181 --> 01:02:00,014
we should have civil rights.
It wasn't that way to simply be asking 

1429
01:02:03,081 --> 01:02:03,914
to get rid of separate but equal in the 
south is radical and they're turning 

1430
01:02:07,851 --> 01:02:10,430
fire hoses on you and setting dogs on 
you,

1431
01:02:10,760 --> 01:02:15,760
and a good 40 to 60% of the country is 
thinking those are bad people today.

1432
01:02:17,690 --> 01:02:20,070
If you showed the same today,
the number

1433
01:02:20,070 --> 01:02:21,660
of people that would say,
oh my God,

1434
01:02:21,661 --> 01:02:24,300
that's horrible,
would be in the 90 percentile.

1435
01:02:24,330 --> 01:02:28,020
But that's because we've moved on.
And in part because of what those people

1436
01:02:28,021 --> 01:02:28,860
went through.
In other words,

1437
01:02:29,400 --> 01:02:30,233
Martin Luther King is more of a hero now
because the times have changed in part 

1438
01:02:32,671 --> 01:02:35,600
because of Martin Luther King,
so that he's not seen as the radical.

1439
01:02:35,601 --> 01:02:38,700
He was go read the things the FBI said 
about him and their minds.

1440
01:02:38,940 --> 01:02:40,320
He's a communist.
He,

1441
01:02:40,321 --> 01:02:41,154
I mean,
go kill yourself was what they fbi 

1442
01:02:42,780 --> 01:02:44,250
letter send to you?
Go Kill Yourself.

1443
01:02:44,340 --> 01:02:46,680
I mean,
can you even imagine today?

1444
01:02:46,681 --> 01:02:47,514
So,
so what happens is when we have these 

1445
01:02:48,361 --> 01:02:50,610
figures that are radical and 
controversial at the time,

1446
01:02:50,760 --> 01:02:51,593
if they were ahead of their times,
then they end up looking like much more 

1447
01:02:56,220 --> 01:02:57,053
banal figures than they really were.
Martin Luther King was revolutionary is 

1448
01:03:00,661 --> 01:03:03,540
too strong,
but edgy and in a good way,

1449
01:03:03,541 --> 01:03:04,170
in my opinion.

1450
01:03:04,170 --> 01:03:07,740
But now of course he looks edgy in a way
where we've all gone that route right at

1451
01:03:07,741 --> 01:03:08,574
the time.
There are a lot of people that didn't 

1452
01:03:09,751 --> 01:03:11,750
like his stance and,
and if you think kings edge,

1453
01:03:11,751 --> 01:03:13,870
you look at Malcolm X.
Yeah,

1454
01:03:13,940 --> 01:03:15,990
for sure.
So any means necessary.

1455
01:03:16,020 --> 01:03:16,853
So as someone that talks about the 
constitution and the separation of 

1456
01:03:19,471 --> 01:03:21,630
powers and all that stuff,
and you just mentioned separate,

1457
01:03:21,631 --> 01:03:22,920
separate but equal,
right.

1458
01:03:22,970 --> 01:03:24,600
Um,
it's incredible to me.

1459
01:03:24,601 --> 01:03:25,434
You know,
in our constitution it says all men are 

1460
01:03:26,611 --> 01:03:29,730
created equal and yet these same people 
had slaves.

1461
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:30,833
Eventually we freed the slaves and then 
we got to a place where we were allowed 

1462
01:03:33,121 --> 01:03:35,250
to have separate schools,
but if they were equal,

1463
01:03:35,340 --> 01:03:37,710
if they were equal but separate,
then that was okay.

1464
01:03:38,370 --> 01:03:39,203
But is the,
is that arc always bending towards 

1465
01:03:40,501 --> 01:03:41,334
justice?
Because I know it seems like right now 

1466
01:03:42,691 --> 01:03:43,524
everyone is more at each other's throats
than ever before and angrier and more 

1467
01:03:46,201 --> 01:03:47,460
divided and all that stuff.

1468
01:03:47,730 --> 01:03:48,870
But I would,
I would argue,

1469
01:03:48,871 --> 01:03:50,370
and I've had a lot of guests come on and
argue this,

1470
01:03:50,371 --> 01:03:51,204
that basically things have gotten a lot 
better and we're always going to have 

1471
01:03:54,870 --> 01:03:55,703
problems for sure.
And that doesn't mean we can always be 

1472
01:03:56,971 --> 01:03:57,804
better,
but that really things have gotten a 

1473
01:03:59,731 --> 01:04:00,564
tremendous amount better in large part 
because if we were just governed by the 

1474
01:04:03,301 --> 01:04:04,590
constitution,
it's a pretty great thing.

1475
01:04:04,620 --> 01:04:08,100
I require clarification on the word 
better.

1476
01:04:08,730 --> 01:04:09,563
Better in that it,
we are a more just society and the 

1477
01:04:12,771 --> 01:04:13,604
United States.
The United States specifically is a 

1478
01:04:15,691 --> 01:04:16,524
more,
has consistently become a more just 

1479
01:04:18,391 --> 01:04:21,150
society.
Every decade that has gone by basically.

1480
01:04:21,630 --> 01:04:23,850
I am sure we could probably find some 
setbacks.

1481
01:04:24,030 --> 01:04:26,460
Maybe you could think of a good person 
basically.

1482
01:04:26,461 --> 01:04:28,110
Yeah,
the Damn Carlin answer,

1483
01:04:28,111 --> 01:04:28,944
because wine is going to be different 
than anybody else's made me is that I 

1484
01:04:31,351 --> 01:04:32,310
want you to speak for everybody.

1485
01:04:32,330 --> 01:04:35,220
Well,
if I'm here now,

1486
01:04:36,240 --> 01:04:38,320
I thought the first 15 minutes we were 
talking for everybody,

1487
01:04:39,170 --> 01:04:40,003
Dan Carlin.
Here's the way I look at it when I grew 

1488
01:04:41,371 --> 01:04:41,640
up,
you know,

1489
01:04:41,640 --> 01:04:42,473
I think we are,
our expectation levels are set at an 

1490
01:04:45,001 --> 01:04:45,834
early age and so the era I grew up in 
the 1970s I consider to be the high 

1491
01:04:49,860 --> 01:04:51,960
watermark of,
for example,

1492
01:04:51,961 --> 01:04:52,794
things like journalism and as a person 
who feels and came up in the 

1493
01:04:55,411 --> 01:04:57,180
journalistic profession,
that's my background.

1494
01:04:57,600 --> 01:05:02,600
I have a high minded idealistic and 
maybe even inaccurate historical view of

1495
01:05:03,721 --> 01:05:04,554
how I see journalism.
Because if you look at journalism 

1496
01:05:06,301 --> 01:05:07,410
throughout most of the country's 
history,

1497
01:05:07,411 --> 01:05:11,010
it starts off in Revolutionary Times as 
absolutely,

1498
01:05:11,011 --> 01:05:12,990
you know,
I mean they're just yelling awful things

1499
01:05:12,991 --> 01:05:13,824
to each other in different papers and 
the personal attacks and that's why you 

1500
01:05:15,901 --> 01:05:18,010
have libel and slander.
People don't

1501
01:05:18,010 --> 01:05:18,701
realize that.
No,

1502
01:05:18,701 --> 01:05:19,130
no.
It's all,

1503
01:05:19,130 --> 01:05:20,940
it used to be a lot of heroin people 
don't,

1504
01:05:20,941 --> 01:05:23,060
they speak to each other so horribly now
full.

1505
01:05:23,320 --> 01:05:24,153
And then you go to the periods,
you look at the 1930s and forties and 

1506
01:05:26,591 --> 01:05:28,330
it's all corporate stuff,
right?

1507
01:05:28,331 --> 01:05:30,170
A lot of the stuff that just fed to you 
from a,

1508
01:05:30,171 --> 01:05:31,660
you know,
and then you get to the,

1509
01:05:31,860 --> 01:05:36,860
the 1960s and even then it's still what 
we would call today almost propaganda.

1510
01:05:37,450 --> 01:05:40,750
Then you get to the 1970s,
the post Watergate period is this little

1511
01:05:40,810 --> 01:05:45,810
teeny era where it was the way I think 
it should always be.

1512
01:05:46,191 --> 01:05:47,920
And if I'm speaking for everybody,
it's the way it should all be.

1513
01:05:48,240 --> 01:05:50,490
Um,
where it was rough.

1514
01:05:50,500 --> 01:05:52,180
As a matter of fact,
listener once told me,

1515
01:05:52,181 --> 01:05:54,700
and,
and he sent me the speech,

1516
01:05:54,920 --> 01:05:58,120
a Katharine Graham who was the editor of
the Washington Post,

1517
01:05:58,450 --> 01:05:59,283
had had to give a big speech after 
Watergate to all the big wig people and 

1518
01:06:03,581 --> 01:06:04,870
say,
don't worry,

1519
01:06:04,900 --> 01:06:06,430
this isn't going to be a trend.

1520
01:06:06,430 --> 01:06:08,140
We're not going to be this,
this,

1521
01:06:08,170 --> 01:06:11,410
you know,
expose everybody all the time because it

1522
01:06:11,411 --> 01:06:12,670
was so unusual.
But I mean,

1523
01:06:12,671 --> 01:06:15,370
if you go look at 60 minutes,
the way 60 minutes used to be,

1524
01:06:15,371 --> 01:06:16,900
they used to say,
the worst thing that could happen to you

1525
01:06:16,901 --> 01:06:19,600
was to see Mike Wallace of 60 minutes 
walking up your driveway.

1526
01:06:19,601 --> 01:06:20,470
Right?
Run.

1527
01:06:20,700 --> 01:06:22,810
Um,
we don't do that anymore.

1528
01:06:22,960 --> 01:06:23,793
And so for me,
if we had the kind of media that we had 

1529
01:06:26,051 --> 01:06:26,884
in the 1970s,
so much of what I disagree with today 

1530
01:06:29,591 --> 01:06:32,290
could not stand.
It's like the idea of sunlight being the

1531
01:06:32,291 --> 01:06:35,860
antiseptic.
If we talked about it and if we had,

1532
01:06:35,861 --> 01:06:36,694
the problem with media fragmentation is 
that we're not all seeing the same 

1533
01:06:39,401 --> 01:06:40,234
things.
Um,

1534
01:06:40,450 --> 01:06:42,640
now is that good or bad?
It's uh,

1535
01:06:42,670 --> 01:06:43,310
it's a,
it's,

1536
01:06:43,310 --> 01:06:44,143
it's something you way,
but in the water cooler discussions in 

1537
01:06:47,051 --> 01:06:47,884
the 1970s,
we were at least all talking about the 

1538
01:06:49,031 --> 01:06:49,510
same things.

1539
01:06:49,510 --> 01:06:51,490
And you might say the Washington Post 
lies like a dog,

1540
01:06:51,580 --> 01:06:53,820
but we're still talking about the story 
that they wrote and,

1541
01:06:53,890 --> 01:06:55,450
and debating it.
Um,

1542
01:06:55,780 --> 01:06:58,180
so when you say things are getting 
better,

1543
01:06:58,760 --> 01:06:59,730
I,
I,

1544
01:06:59,800 --> 01:07:00,633
it depends on how you define it.
The iphones are certainly better than 

1545
01:07:02,441 --> 01:07:03,274
they were in the 1970s,
but I guess we're talking about two 

1546
01:07:05,141 --> 01:07:06,240
different things.
So I would say I'm,

1547
01:07:06,310 --> 01:07:07,143
I was purely talking about just the 
rights of the human beings of the 

1548
01:07:09,461 --> 01:07:10,294
citizens of the United States.
And it depends on if you ask folks from 

1549
01:07:15,070 --> 01:07:19,480
a cultural minorities in this country,
I think it's better because they've been

1550
01:07:19,481 --> 01:07:20,314
progressing at a different pace.
But if you say the rights of Americans 

1551
01:07:24,071 --> 01:07:24,904
in terms of,
you know the word liberty is a funny 

1552
01:07:26,591 --> 01:07:29,140
word.
Charles Austin Beard said decades ago,

1553
01:07:29,141 --> 01:07:29,974
that all you need do to get a reputation
as a dangerous radical these days is to 

1554
01:07:34,181 --> 01:07:36,940
go around spouting the sayings of the 
founding fathers.

1555
01:07:37,240 --> 01:07:38,073
I would say that that the same thing.
We'll get you on a domestic terrorism 

1556
01:07:41,141 --> 01:07:41,974
list these days,
and yet words like liberty used to be 

1557
01:07:45,161 --> 01:07:46,780
used in a,
in a real sense.

1558
01:07:46,781 --> 01:07:48,100
Now what does liberty mean?
Well,

1559
01:07:48,101 --> 01:07:51,190
you could talk to 20 different people 
and get 20 different definitions,

1560
01:07:52,030 --> 01:07:55,390
but it doesn't mean what it used in the 
70s we had this concept,

1561
01:07:55,391 --> 01:07:59,920
and it might not jive with the reality 
the 1970s but the attitude then was that

1562
01:07:59,921 --> 01:08:02,050
they're always going to get better,
right?

1563
01:08:02,080 --> 01:08:03,940
Your rights are going to get better.
You're gonna have more rights.

1564
01:08:03,941 --> 01:08:04,774
You got all these things and they're not
the 1970s in terms of personal freedom 

1565
01:08:08,711 --> 01:08:10,990
and all these things.
Not only was it better,

1566
01:08:11,230 --> 01:08:13,720
but the concept in the culture was 
different.

1567
01:08:13,721 --> 01:08:14,554
I would argue that if you grab a 20 year
old today and then talk about some of 

1568
01:08:18,051 --> 01:08:20,990
the things we used to think when I was 
growing up should be part of your rights

1569
01:08:20,991 --> 01:08:22,670
and said,
would you like to live in a country like

1570
01:08:22,671 --> 01:08:23,120
that?

1571
01:08:23,120 --> 01:08:24,650
A decent number of them are not going to
go.

1572
01:08:24,651 --> 01:08:25,700
No.
Right.

1573
01:08:25,730 --> 01:08:26,563
So I would even say that the concept of 
the kinds of country I would like to 

1574
01:08:31,251 --> 01:08:34,780
see,
Mike had been bred out of my country.

1575
01:08:34,781 --> 01:08:36,710
Men because of the changes in the 
culture.

1576
01:08:37,040 --> 01:08:39,650
Um,
government is much more powerful,

1577
01:08:39,830 --> 01:08:41,480
insular,
secretive.

1578
01:08:41,660 --> 01:08:44,060
I mean the secrecy had government is a 
disaster.

1579
01:08:44,540 --> 01:08:47,360
How do we go for that?
We go for it because while we don't have

1580
01:08:47,361 --> 01:08:49,850
a press exposing it and talking about 
how enrages it is,

1581
01:08:49,940 --> 01:08:52,430
but two because the cultural norms put 
up with it,

1582
01:08:53,210 --> 01:08:57,260
we are much more scared than we were in 
the 70s which is part of what,

1583
01:08:57,380 --> 01:08:58,213
that's another reason the 70s were so 
great because we had just exited an era 

1584
01:09:01,161 --> 01:09:01,994
where people were as afraid of communism
then is we are a terrorism today and in 

1585
01:09:05,961 --> 01:09:06,794
the 70s we stopped being,
so it was the beginning of the period 

1586
01:09:09,861 --> 01:09:11,900
where all of a sudden people would say,
oh my God,

1587
01:09:11,901 --> 01:09:13,580
you know the commies are going to come 
and you'd say,

1588
01:09:14,060 --> 01:09:14,893
no,
they're not.

1589
01:09:15,080 --> 01:09:15,913
And yet this,
the taking away of the fear was like 

1590
01:09:18,111 --> 01:09:23,111
dispelling something and after September
11th then remember it started,

1591
01:09:23,241 --> 01:09:24,074
we had World Trade Center bombings in 95
we the omnibus terrorism antiterrorism 

1592
01:09:27,090 --> 01:09:29,840
maximum 96 I mean this has been a long,
people forget those things,

1593
01:09:29,841 --> 01:09:31,910
but nine 11 was a capsize point.
Yeah.

1594
01:09:32,240 --> 01:09:33,073
We are too afraid to have the kind of 
freedom and liberty that I grew up 

1595
01:09:37,491 --> 01:09:39,530
expecting.
Not only that we were going to have,

1596
01:09:39,680 --> 01:09:41,450
but that every decade it would get 
better.

1597
01:09:41,600 --> 01:09:44,360
When you say getting better,
that's how we felt in the 70s.

1598
01:09:44,361 --> 01:09:46,650
And yet I would say to you,
press freedom is worse.

1599
01:09:46,651 --> 01:09:48,280
Personal freedom is worse.
Our,

1600
01:09:48,281 --> 01:09:50,300
our conception of what the government 
should do is worse.

1601
01:09:50,301 --> 01:09:51,740
The secrecy is worse.
So I mean,

1602
01:09:51,741 --> 01:09:55,100
it depends on how you define it.
Obviously if you are an African American

1603
01:09:55,101 --> 01:09:55,934
in this country,
I think things are better today than 

1604
01:09:56,721 --> 01:09:56,910
they were.

1605
01:09:56,910 --> 01:09:58,030
And then I studied.
Uh,

1606
01:09:58,220 --> 01:09:59,053
but,
uh,

1607
01:09:59,150 --> 01:10:01,730
so depending on where you're looking at,
what your viewpoint is,

1608
01:10:01,970 --> 01:10:04,160
um,
but my argument is from the standards of

1609
01:10:04,161 --> 01:10:04,994
the constitution and all that,
the 1970s may have been the high 

1610
01:10:07,150 --> 01:10:10,370
watermark of American self image of what
these things should be.

1611
01:10:10,371 --> 01:10:11,204
So That's interesting.
So that it went from sort of of real 

1612
01:10:13,881 --> 01:10:14,714
personal liberty,
which we've come along way and pave the 

1613
01:10:17,541 --> 01:10:19,870
way you want to,
as long as you weren't hurting someone.

1614
01:10:20,120 --> 01:10:24,200
So that we've come a nice way.
What we've lost in the course of that is

1615
01:10:24,201 --> 01:10:27,830
that we've allowed government to get 
bigger and spy on us.

1616
01:10:27,831 --> 01:10:28,130
And,
uh,

1617
01:10:28,130 --> 01:10:28,963
and at the same time,
watch the press kind of crumble around 

1618
01:10:31,221 --> 01:10:32,054
us,
but it's our do it and there you got to 

1619
01:10:34,341 --> 01:10:35,180
look in the mirror.
I,

1620
01:10:35,181 --> 01:10:36,014
yeah,
I used to call something the Pinocchio 

1621
01:10:37,041 --> 01:10:37,874
effect when it comes to the,
remember the Oliver Wendell Holmes had 

1622
01:10:39,471 --> 01:10:42,200
defined the limits of liberty on the 
court and he said,

1623
01:10:42,560 --> 01:10:46,580
the right to swing your fist ends with 
the other man's nose begins.

1624
01:10:47,020 --> 01:10:47,853
And I had asked the question,
what if the other man's nose is 

1625
01:10:49,851 --> 01:10:51,860
continually growing?
Right?

1626
01:10:52,130 --> 01:10:55,670
In other words,
if you say you can live the way you want

1627
01:10:55,671 --> 01:10:56,504
until you harm somebody else,
what if you decide things harm you now 

1628
01:11:00,230 --> 01:11:02,900
that didn't harm you before?
For example,

1629
01:11:04,220 --> 01:11:08,240
if you play your music too loud and I 
live next door to you and I can't sleep,

1630
01:11:08,540 --> 01:11:09,373
you're directly impacting me.
That's a direct imposition on my 

1631
01:11:12,651 --> 01:11:13,484
freedom.
So you shouldn't be able to play your 

1632
01:11:14,641 --> 01:11:17,100
music that loud.
If on the other hand,

1633
01:11:17,310 --> 01:11:18,143
I smoked cigarettes and my insurance 
company is going to have to pay for me 

1634
01:11:21,781 --> 01:11:24,330
if I get sick,
which is going to raise your rates,

1635
01:11:24,360 --> 01:11:25,193
right?
Did I really impact your rights where 

1636
01:11:26,851 --> 01:11:28,020
people will say,
I can,

1637
01:11:28,110 --> 01:11:30,600
I can impact your rights because you're 
costing me money.

1638
01:11:31,140 --> 01:11:31,973
Okay,
well that's the equivalent of the nose 

1639
01:11:32,971 --> 01:11:33,804
growing longer.
I call that wallet rights because it's 

1640
01:11:35,161 --> 01:11:38,010
different than a direct inhibition on 
your rights.

1641
01:11:38,011 --> 01:11:40,860
It's an indirect one.
Now the problem with that is if you're a

1642
01:11:40,861 --> 01:11:41,694
clever,
you can connect point a to point B on 

1643
01:11:45,930 --> 01:11:46,660
anything.
Yeah.

1644
01:11:46,660 --> 01:11:50,040
Why don't you say if it costs you money 
in a society is interconnected,

1645
01:11:50,041 --> 01:11:51,510
is ours,
then you,

1646
01:11:51,511 --> 01:11:52,344
then you,
then Oliver Wendell Holmes is whole 

1647
01:11:53,701 --> 01:11:54,534
proposition goes out the window because 
then everybody's actions cost you 

1648
01:11:57,991 --> 01:11:58,830
something,
right?

1649
01:11:58,860 --> 01:12:00,290
So you,
you,

1650
01:12:00,600 --> 01:12:02,010
you can't swing your fist at all.

1651
01:12:02,050 --> 01:12:02,771
Right?
You'd be out there,

1652
01:12:02,771 --> 01:12:04,750
grabbed the cigarettes out of people's 
maps,

1653
01:12:05,930 --> 01:12:08,750
become the problem.
Once we decided that instead of a direct

1654
01:12:08,780 --> 01:12:09,613
challenge to your right to live the way 
an indirect challenges and imposition 

1655
01:12:12,950 --> 01:12:13,783
and becomes cause for limiting you,
then we've destroyed the entire idea 

1656
01:12:17,361 --> 01:12:18,194
that you have any personal liberty that 
you could call your own because 

1657
01:12:20,751 --> 01:12:23,150
everything you do impacts at least my 
wallet somehow.

1658
01:12:23,390 --> 01:12:25,450
That's interesting.
So let's just quickly before we wrap up,

1659
01:12:25,451 --> 01:12:26,284
go back to the example of the music,
cause I think it's a perfect example of 

1660
01:12:28,481 --> 01:12:29,314
where we can talk about government 
intrusion and personal rights and all 

1661
01:12:31,241 --> 01:12:32,074
that stuff.
So if my next door neighbor was banging 

1662
01:12:33,701 --> 01:12:35,920
on the piano all day long,
even if they were playing great,

1663
01:12:35,950 --> 01:12:37,900
great classical music,
but it was bothering me,

1664
01:12:38,230 --> 01:12:40,570
I would eventually go next door and say,
you know,

1665
01:12:40,571 --> 01:12:43,150
if you wouldn't mind maybe from these 
hours,

1666
01:12:43,151 --> 01:12:43,961
you know,
Blah Blah Blah,

1667
01:12:43,961 --> 01:12:44,794
please play impacted my right.
I'm saying this is my right in my own 

1668
01:12:48,641 --> 01:12:51,760
home to be live here peaceably and,
and not be.

1669
01:12:52,020 --> 01:12:52,853
And the older rule,
you wouldn't like it if I did it to you 

1670
01:12:54,460 --> 01:12:55,140
right now,
would you?

1671
01:12:55,140 --> 01:12:55,973
I would use something like that,
but it would be me expressing my 

1672
01:12:58,360 --> 01:13:00,460
thoughts and then hopefully them hearing
that.

1673
01:13:00,730 --> 01:13:02,020
Now what a lot of people would say is,
no,

1674
01:13:02,021 --> 01:13:02,200
no,
no.

1675
01:13:02,200 --> 01:13:03,870
You,
they would say maybe you would try that,

1676
01:13:03,880 --> 01:13:05,560
but if they don't,
well then what's the next step?

1677
01:13:05,710 --> 01:13:09,070
Do you go to your local congressmen or 
councilman and say,

1678
01:13:09,190 --> 01:13:12,010
we need some sort of noise law passed.
Uh,

1679
01:13:12,011 --> 01:13:16,240
and then all you're doing really is just
expanding the government to then control

1680
01:13:16,241 --> 01:13:18,850
what should be done as an interpersonal 
thing.

1681
01:13:18,851 --> 01:13:21,430
But sometimes you can't win all of those
interpret what is,

1682
01:13:21,490 --> 01:13:23,200
what if the guy just says,
well go fuck yourself.

1683
01:13:23,410 --> 01:13:24,243
Sorry Buddy.
That how do you balance liberty and not 

1684
01:13:27,491 --> 01:13:28,610
an intrusive government?
It's,

1685
01:13:28,630 --> 01:13:29,463
this gets back to my views on,
on not educating the American populace 

1686
01:13:33,250 --> 01:13:35,470
on what their freedoms are and what they
mean.

1687
01:13:35,530 --> 01:13:36,370
We don't do enough.
I mean,

1688
01:13:36,480 --> 01:13:38,010
liberty's a bad word now.
Yeah.

1689
01:13:38,110 --> 01:13:39,840
And yet,
look at your phone,

1690
01:13:39,870 --> 01:13:40,703
new documents.
It's,

1691
01:13:40,750 --> 01:13:42,180
it's the number,
like the word liberty.

1692
01:13:42,200 --> 01:13:42,611
Okay.
But,

1693
01:13:42,611 --> 01:13:43,810
but no one even knows what it means.

1694
01:13:43,810 --> 01:13:44,860
And Yeah.
So for example,

1695
01:13:44,861 --> 01:13:46,750
I always connected it to the golden 
rule.

1696
01:13:47,140 --> 01:13:47,973
The amount of freedom you're willing to 
give your fellow human being in this 

1697
01:13:50,471 --> 01:13:53,230
country is directly proportional to what
you get.

1698
01:13:53,350 --> 01:13:54,910
So you're saying,
God,

1699
01:13:54,911 --> 01:13:56,800
that music really disturbs me,
but you know what?

1700
01:13:56,801 --> 01:13:57,634
The guy enjoys it.
I'm going to cut him some slack until 

1701
01:13:58,841 --> 01:13:59,674
8:00
PM and then I'm going to go to him and 

1702
01:14:00,341 --> 01:14:01,210
say,
hey buddy,

1703
01:14:01,211 --> 01:14:02,170
you know what?
After 8:00

1704
01:14:02,170 --> 01:14:03,210
PM can we cut it off?
And yeah,

1705
01:14:03,240 --> 01:14:05,290
and that's a,
that's,

1706
01:14:05,320 --> 01:14:08,710
that's a fantasy way to live because 
human beings aren't that way.

1707
01:14:08,760 --> 01:14:11,020
But at the same time,
there is a golden rule aspect,

1708
01:14:11,110 --> 01:14:12,040
liberty.
And if you get

1709
01:14:12,040 --> 01:14:12,873
too restrictive of your fellow man,
you're in effect restricting yourself 

1710
01:14:15,940 --> 01:14:16,773
right now.
People don't understand this because we 

1711
01:14:18,881 --> 01:14:20,040
don't do,
you know,

1712
01:14:20,050 --> 01:14:21,430
if you go look at the founding 
documents,

1713
01:14:21,610 --> 01:14:23,730
there are areas,
right and arrows.

1714
01:14:23,740 --> 01:14:26,690
Certain things become big in this era.
We talk about terrorism a lot and we,

1715
01:14:26,691 --> 01:14:29,400
and we get granular with it and examine 
it in,

1716
01:14:29,401 --> 01:14:30,234
in that era.
And Liberty was big and all these great 

1717
01:14:32,021 --> 01:14:34,000
writers,
the John Locke's and all these people we

1718
01:14:34,001 --> 01:14:34,834
celebrate today that Thomas Paine's,
they were examining that question from 

1719
01:14:38,200 --> 01:14:39,430
and their version,
by the way,

1720
01:14:39,431 --> 01:14:40,264
what they meant when they said liberty 
is different than what even you and I 

1721
01:14:42,401 --> 01:14:43,234
are talking about today.
They had an 18th century political 

1722
01:14:46,001 --> 01:14:48,910
concept of what it meant,
but in the 70s,

1723
01:14:48,911 --> 01:14:49,744
to get back to the,
what I like to call the high watermark 

1724
01:14:51,370 --> 01:14:52,203
of our concept of these things,
this idea of your right to live your 

1725
01:14:56,501 --> 01:15:00,070
life the way you see fit was pretty darn
strong.

1726
01:15:00,430 --> 01:15:05,430
And that became restricted due to this 
idea that people were going too far.

1727
01:15:06,730 --> 01:15:10,330
And in my view,
I have a hard time with going too far in

1728
01:15:10,331 --> 01:15:14,500
your rights to live your life,
especially if you're not directly in and

1729
01:15:14,501 --> 01:15:18,130
directly not wallet rights directly 
impinging on my freedom,

1730
01:15:18,370 --> 01:15:19,850
for example.
Um,

1731
01:15:20,770 --> 01:15:22,990
we are less tolerant as a species.
I mean,

1732
01:15:22,991 --> 01:15:25,780
look at how angry people get at smokers,
for example.

1733
01:15:26,110 --> 01:15:28,030
I understand it,
especially if it impacts your health.

1734
01:15:28,031 --> 01:15:31,240
At the same time,
there's no sense amongst,

1735
01:15:31,241 --> 01:15:34,480
and I don't mean to single out anybody 
because we all do this in our own ways,

1736
01:15:34,660 --> 01:15:37,380
but to sing them,
to not understand that,

1737
01:15:37,381 --> 01:15:38,530
that that impacts you,
they'll say,

1738
01:15:38,531 --> 01:15:39,364
well,
I don't smoke so I don't care what I do 

1739
01:15:40,061 --> 01:15:40,841
to those look,
yes,

1740
01:15:40,841 --> 01:15:44,560
but it impacts the general idea about 
what you're allowed to do.

1741
01:15:44,890 --> 01:15:46,450
They are doing something illegal.

1742
01:15:46,690 --> 01:15:48,630
Well and,
and you may not like it.

1743
01:15:48,640 --> 01:15:51,190
We all do something that someone doesn't
like.

1744
01:15:51,191 --> 01:15:54,070
And the way we've become these way is 
very selfish about our rights.

1745
01:15:54,100 --> 01:15:56,020
If I do it,
it's important.

1746
01:15:56,050 --> 01:15:59,140
If I don't do it and it costs me money 
to hell with that.

1747
01:15:59,380 --> 01:16:00,213
There's a general concept though that we
should teach in schools about how 

1748
01:16:02,951 --> 01:16:03,784
liberty is a give and take thing and 
that and so then what do you do when 

1749
01:16:06,671 --> 01:16:08,440
they keep taking?
So going back to this guy,

1750
01:16:08,441 --> 01:16:09,274
so now it's eight o'clock.
I've expressed it kindly and nicely to 

1751
01:16:11,291 --> 01:16:12,640
him.
Eight o'clock rolls by,

1752
01:16:12,641 --> 01:16:16,640
he's still slash that's the swing my 
nose fifth.

1753
01:16:16,840 --> 01:16:18,640
That's when you may need to do have a 
noise ordinance.

1754
01:16:18,641 --> 01:16:19,474
And that's why I'm not one of those 
libertarians who would say you don't 

1755
01:16:21,671 --> 01:16:22,504
need government.
All these things can be handled between 

1756
01:16:23,501 --> 01:16:24,334
individuals.
No you can't because some people are 

1757
01:16:25,691 --> 01:16:27,940
jerks among other things and some,
you know.

1758
01:16:28,630 --> 01:16:30,940
So that's what I was trying to get the 
line between.

1759
01:16:30,941 --> 01:16:34,060
I guess I'm not a libertarian 
libertarianism in class.

1760
01:16:34,160 --> 01:16:35,980
We can't take care of themselves.
That's the,

1761
01:16:35,981 --> 01:16:37,300
I mean,
when you get to libertarianism,

1762
01:16:37,301 --> 01:16:38,134
that's my other problem is that I don't 
have as much faith as they do that if 

1763
01:16:41,891 --> 01:16:44,500
you took away the supports,
shall we say,

1764
01:16:44,860 --> 01:16:47,470
the people necessarily can take care of 
those as I can.

1765
01:16:47,800 --> 01:16:49,270
You can.
But,

1766
01:16:49,300 --> 01:16:51,210
but not only can,
not everyone take care of them,

1767
01:16:51,790 --> 01:16:52,623
great English,
but not only can not everyone take care 

1768
01:16:53,711 --> 01:16:54,544
of themselves,
but there are people that do absolutely 

1769
01:16:56,111 --> 01:16:59,620
vital jobs in our society that are not 
profit center things.

1770
01:16:59,950 --> 01:17:00,783
And you look at the caretakers who take 
and they make nothing and you look at 

1771
01:17:03,701 --> 01:17:04,211
them and you go,
yeah,

1772
01:17:04,211 --> 01:17:06,100
but what are you going to do when you 
need a caretaker?

1773
01:17:06,280 --> 01:17:08,890
Society doesn't allocate resources.

1774
01:17:09,270 --> 01:17:10,250
Uh,
and never has.

1775
01:17:10,251 --> 01:17:10,881
By the way.
This is,

1776
01:17:10,881 --> 01:17:11,714
again,
we're talking about fantasy here in 

1777
01:17:12,711 --> 01:17:13,950
theoreticals,
but,

1778
01:17:13,960 --> 01:17:16,370
but doesn't allocate resources that way.
So when I talk,

1779
01:17:16,520 --> 01:17:19,040
I'm a libertarian,
when it comes to civil liberties,

1780
01:17:19,220 --> 01:17:21,740
when you talk about how you organize 
society,

1781
01:17:21,920 --> 01:17:22,753
I always,
I always wonder about what I call the 

1782
01:17:23,541 --> 01:17:25,220
losers.
And I don't mean that in the terrible,

1783
01:17:25,340 --> 01:17:27,260
but there are winners and there are 
losers.

1784
01:17:27,650 --> 01:17:31,040
And if you have too many losers in your 
society,

1785
01:17:31,250 --> 01:17:35,150
they will destroy your stuff.
They will make you feel their pain.

1786
01:17:35,151 --> 01:17:36,260
I didn't show once,
I called,

1787
01:17:36,780 --> 01:17:38,780
well what called one.
What about the losers?

1788
01:17:39,080 --> 01:17:40,670
I called the other one,
um,

1789
01:17:40,690 --> 01:17:43,220
the,
the revenge of the gangrenous finger.

1790
01:17:43,490 --> 01:17:44,180
And I said,
listen,

1791
01:17:44,180 --> 01:17:45,070
if you're a human,
if,

1792
01:17:45,080 --> 01:17:45,351
if,
if,

1793
01:17:45,351 --> 01:17:50,270
if our societies like a human body and 
this finger gets disease,

1794
01:17:50,330 --> 01:17:52,430
you may say to heck with this finger who
needs it,

1795
01:17:52,431 --> 01:17:53,920
it's a small finger and hey,
I got to,

1796
01:17:54,140 --> 01:17:54,973
well,
you can get away with that for a while 

1797
01:17:55,761 --> 01:17:59,210
until it gets bad enough and then it 
will make you feel it's pain.

1798
01:17:59,390 --> 01:18:01,370
There's a reason the French revolution 
happened,

1799
01:18:01,400 --> 01:18:02,233
right?
There's a balance and a stacy's that 

1800
01:18:03,801 --> 01:18:04,634
every society needs and there's a 
certain amount it can go before it gets 

1801
01:18:06,981 --> 01:18:08,990
out of balance.
If you say,

1802
01:18:08,991 --> 01:18:09,824
I have an ideological template that says
it's every man for himself and enough 

1803
01:18:12,831 --> 01:18:15,110
people don't make it,
they'll get rid of your ideology.

1804
01:18:15,130 --> 01:18:16,670
Yeah.
And they'll destroy your society.

1805
01:18:16,750 --> 01:18:17,583
So would you basically say the classical
liberalism is just sort of a more 

1806
01:18:19,661 --> 01:18:20,494
realistic version of libertarianism?
That's sort of where I've come around 

1807
01:18:23,650 --> 01:18:24,483
that I would consider myself a classical
liberal cause I do cause I'm agreeing 

1808
01:18:26,591 --> 01:18:29,590
with you on this that I,
I see some use for the state.

1809
01:18:29,591 --> 01:18:32,950
There are some things that the state has
to do and I want lower taxes,

1810
01:18:32,951 --> 01:18:34,900
but I understand that you have to be 
taxed.

1811
01:18:35,100 --> 01:18:36,680
Everything is a balance.
Yeah.

1812
01:18:36,960 --> 01:18:40,230
And the problem is,
is that because conditions change,

1813
01:18:40,231 --> 01:18:45,231
you have to continually be rebalancing.
And the likelihood in a system like ours

1814
01:18:45,990 --> 01:18:49,920
where your views and my views are not 
what the politics,

1815
01:18:49,921 --> 01:18:50,754
this is where the corruption comes in.
And I want to use the word corruption 

1816
01:18:53,131 --> 01:18:57,570
because when we talk about campaign 
finance reform or something like that,

1817
01:18:57,571 --> 01:19:01,830
it sounds like an issue to be argued.
When you say corruption,

1818
01:19:02,040 --> 01:19:04,860
there is no good argument for 
corruption.

1819
01:19:05,190 --> 01:19:06,023
And what I always say is every 
government is corrupt because you can't 

1820
01:19:08,281 --> 01:19:09,720
help it.
But if you go look at the,

1821
01:19:09,750 --> 01:19:10,583
uh,
the US government actually puts out an 

1822
01:19:11,731 --> 01:19:14,070
index of corruption,
believe it or not.

1823
01:19:14,310 --> 01:19:15,170
And,
um,

1824
01:19:15,200 --> 01:19:16,033
though at the top countries are the 
least corrupt countries and at the 

1825
01:19:18,301 --> 01:19:20,450
bottom you get to these kleptocracy and 
stuff.

1826
01:19:20,880 --> 01:19:23,070
So everything's in between.
Um,

1827
01:19:23,700 --> 01:19:26,010
even the most clean,
well run.

1828
01:19:26,010 --> 01:19:26,843
Governments have some level of 
corruption and every government can 

1829
01:19:29,551 --> 01:19:31,230
function with a certain amount,
right?

1830
01:19:31,231 --> 01:19:33,780
But there's a tipping point somewhere on
that scale.

1831
01:19:33,781 --> 01:19:35,790
You get to a number where it doesn't 
work anymore,

1832
01:19:35,970 --> 01:19:36,803
where everyone has to be bribed.
The United States used to rank at a 

1833
01:19:39,811 --> 01:19:40,644
level much higher than we rank now.
At what point do you get to a place 

1834
01:19:44,580 --> 01:19:46,680
where it doesn't matter what Dave Ruben 
wants her,

1835
01:19:46,681 --> 01:19:48,510
Dan Carlin wants,
you don't get what you want.

1836
01:19:48,511 --> 01:19:50,190
For example,
all these politicians,

1837
01:19:50,191 --> 01:19:51,750
you know,
where the real flaw in our system is,

1838
01:19:52,020 --> 01:19:54,420
is a politician can promise anything 
they want.

1839
01:19:55,140 --> 01:19:55,973
There's nothing that holds them to it.
You have more protection than a 

1840
01:19:58,291 --> 01:19:59,124
handshake relationship with your 
gardener than you do with a person 

1841
01:20:01,711 --> 01:20:04,830
running for president because they get 
into office and change their minds.

1842
01:20:05,010 --> 01:20:06,720
The only reason you voted for them is 
what they told you.

1843
01:20:06,720 --> 01:20:08,730
They,
if they don't do it well,

1844
01:20:08,731 --> 01:20:09,181
you can say,
well,

1845
01:20:09,181 --> 01:20:10,014
I won't vote for them in four years.
And then in four years you get to a 

1846
01:20:12,031 --> 01:20:16,230
place where it's them against another 
and you hate them both.

1847
01:20:16,270 --> 01:20:17,010
Right?
And what are you going,

1848
01:20:17,010 --> 01:20:19,650
but that's where the two parties kill us
because they put people,

1849
01:20:19,651 --> 01:20:22,980
I mean this and this election is the 
best example you'll ever see.

1850
01:20:23,190 --> 01:20:24,023
How many people held their nose 
regardless of who they voted for and 

1851
01:20:26,851 --> 01:20:27,684
voted for someone they didn't want 
because they really couldn't stand the 

1852
01:20:29,851 --> 01:20:31,680
other guy even more.
Or the other gal even more.

1853
01:20:31,980 --> 01:20:32,813
Um,
who said that they get to pick your 

1854
01:20:35,461 --> 01:20:36,370
choices and they say,
wow,

1855
01:20:36,371 --> 01:20:37,740
you had a whole primary process.
Yes,

1856
01:20:37,741 --> 01:20:38,574
but who got to be in the debates?
And who decided that a commission made 

1857
01:20:40,951 --> 01:20:42,810
up of half Democrats and half 
Republicans?

1858
01:20:42,880 --> 01:20:43,713
How is it that we let the Democrats and 
Republicans decide that the third party 

1859
01:20:46,121 --> 01:20:50,630
could only get in at 15% nationally?
We let the other two parties we get back

1860
01:20:50,780 --> 01:20:53,420
down at the level we let them,
we let them,

1861
01:20:54,090 --> 01:20:55,910
and this is um,
you know,

1862
01:20:55,950 --> 01:20:59,200
I said it on and people hate when I do 
this about looking at the bright side of

1863
01:20:59,201 --> 01:21:00,034
some of these things,
but,

1864
01:21:00,140 --> 01:21:00,973
but sometimes you don't get the right 
reforms in government until somebody 

1865
01:21:05,601 --> 01:21:06,434
crosses a line.
Was Watergate a good thing for the 

1866
01:21:08,931 --> 01:21:09,820
country or the bad thing?
Well,

1867
01:21:09,821 --> 01:21:12,620
when,
when president Gerald Ford forgave,

1868
01:21:12,680 --> 01:21:13,800
pardoned,
uh,

1869
01:21:14,150 --> 01:21:14,983
Kennedy Nixon,
he said our long national nightmare is 

1870
01:21:17,451 --> 01:21:18,284
over.
But we got reforms after that that are 

1871
01:21:21,081 --> 01:21:24,620
the best reforms we've had in 40 years.
So it was Watergate worth it.

1872
01:21:24,860 --> 01:21:25,880
So you say to yourself,
okay,

1873
01:21:25,910 --> 01:21:30,350
if you have to fall off the ledge for us
to fix something in this system,

1874
01:21:30,560 --> 01:21:32,780
should we fall off the ledge?
Okay.

1875
01:21:32,840 --> 01:21:34,960
Only if it gets fixed.
Right.

1876
01:21:35,160 --> 01:21:37,640
It's good.
It's about a constitutional crisis.

1877
01:21:37,641 --> 01:21:39,650
It's a great thing if afterwards you 
solve things,

1878
01:21:39,651 --> 01:21:41,180
it's a bad thing if you lose.

1879
01:21:41,690 --> 01:21:44,060
And so that's that with Donald Trump.
I can sit there and go,

1880
01:21:44,061 --> 01:21:44,894
God,
you know when they talk about a 

1881
01:21:45,861 --> 01:21:46,694
constitutional crisis,
just hearing the word constitution 

1882
01:21:48,201 --> 01:21:49,370
sounds like a reform,
right?

1883
01:21:49,371 --> 01:21:51,500
But talking about it,
but what if you lose?

1884
01:21:51,850 --> 01:21:53,090
So,
so in that sense,

1885
01:21:53,091 --> 01:21:56,090
I'm torn between if you had elected 
Hillary Clinton,

1886
01:21:56,091 --> 01:21:58,130
all those people that are upset with dot
with Donald Trump,

1887
01:21:58,310 --> 01:21:59,143
you would have gotten more of the same.
And I would suggest it's 50 to 60 years 

1888
01:22:03,021 --> 01:22:05,870
of slouching towards 
unconstitutionality.

1889
01:22:06,170 --> 01:22:06,801
I mean,
to me,

1890
01:22:06,801 --> 01:22:07,634
Donald Trump looks like chemotherapy.
He could kill us faster or he could be 

1891
01:22:12,351 --> 01:22:15,230
something that prompts the equivalent of
democratic.

1892
01:22:15,231 --> 01:22:18,670
And I don't mean Democratic Party,
I mean it's a Ma Democratic anti bodies.

1893
01:22:18,930 --> 01:22:23,930
He reminds us why authoritarianism is 
dangerous and what could happen.

1894
01:22:24,111 --> 01:22:25,910
There's a lot of people who don't think 
about politics at all.

1895
01:22:25,911 --> 01:22:26,900
We,
we have lives,

1896
01:22:26,901 --> 01:22:28,930
we have things in our own life that we 
have to focus on.

1897
01:22:28,950 --> 01:22:29,783
I mean,
you want your country to run on 

1898
01:22:30,711 --> 01:22:33,680
autopilot and you want it to run well on
autopilot.

1899
01:22:34,100 --> 01:22:35,820
But in a system of representative 
democracy,

1900
01:22:35,821 --> 01:22:38,120
if the people don't flex their muscles 
long enough,

1901
01:22:38,150 --> 01:22:43,150
things get wiggy been 40 or 50 years 
since we've gone out there with our feet

1902
01:22:43,520 --> 01:22:44,540
and told government,
no,

1903
01:22:44,541 --> 01:22:46,490
you can't do this.
And it takes,

1904
01:22:46,491 --> 01:22:47,324
you know,
they talk about a women's protest with 

1905
01:22:48,171 --> 01:22:50,840
millions of people and that's great,
but that doesn't work.

1906
01:22:50,870 --> 01:22:52,550
It has to be protest.
Yeah,

1907
01:22:52,720 --> 01:22:55,730
you have to maintain it and then they 
listen.

1908
01:22:55,820 --> 01:22:56,653
But um,
you could lose and if we lose then you 

1909
01:22:59,631 --> 01:23:00,800
have to have a plan b country.

1910
01:23:01,460 --> 01:23:02,680
Well,
speaking of Pan Be,

1911
01:23:02,681 --> 01:23:03,514
I think we're going to have to do this 
again to get to some of plan b stuff 

1912
01:23:05,770 --> 01:23:07,460
because I always say it's a good 
interview,

1913
01:23:07,461 --> 01:23:09,790
but I don't have to look down once and I
didn't.

1914
01:23:09,850 --> 01:23:12,280
And I let you talk David,
like give me any time at all.

1915
01:23:12,281 --> 01:23:15,190
Anybody space nicely.
And you took a bit.

1916
01:23:15,440 --> 01:23:17,350
This was really a pleasure.
I mean this is what it's all about.

1917
01:23:17,351 --> 01:23:18,184
This is what I've tried to bring to my 
audience is let's really figure some of 

1918
01:23:21,161 --> 01:23:22,670
this stuff out.
Let's not pretend we,

1919
01:23:22,790 --> 01:23:23,623
we know things that we don't know,
and let's figure out how we're supposed 

1920
01:23:26,081 --> 01:23:29,590
to be governed and how to look at the 
past so we can figure out the future.

1921
01:23:29,591 --> 01:23:31,510
So this is,
this is exactly what I like to do.

1922
01:23:31,530 --> 01:23:32,363
So thank you for coming in.
You're going to stick around and do a 

1923
01:23:33,881 --> 01:23:37,720
little rapid fire for our patron people.
