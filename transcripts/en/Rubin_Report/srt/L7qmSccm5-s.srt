1
00:00:02,670 --> 00:00:03,503
One of my favorite aspects of the Rubin 
report is the feedback that we're 

2
00:00:05,641 --> 00:00:07,950
getting from viewers literally all over 
the world.

3
00:00:07,980 --> 00:00:10,530
Just last week I have viewers from 
countries like Egypt,

4
00:00:10,531 --> 00:00:11,760
Denmark,
Mexico,

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,880
Spain in Australia.
Reach out to me just to name a few.

6
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:16,073
I'm truly humbled at so many of you.
Take the time to share your feelings 

7
00:00:18,541 --> 00:00:21,330
with me and although I don't have time 
to respond to everyone,

8
00:00:21,331 --> 00:00:24,630
I do try to at least read the messages 
that you're sending.

9
00:00:24,810 --> 00:00:25,643
To me.
The most amazing part of this is that 

10
00:00:27,661 --> 00:00:31,410
the conversations we're having on the 
show are transcending race,

11
00:00:31,411 --> 00:00:33,900
religion,
sexuality and nationality.

12
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:35,033
The fight for free speech,
the importance of not giving into the 

13
00:00:37,351 --> 00:00:42,000
authoritarians and the awakening against
the regressives are all ideas that bring

14
00:00:42,001 --> 00:00:45,000
us together.
The power of ideas is universal.

15
00:00:45,060 --> 00:00:48,540
When we discuss free speech,
free thought and free expression,

16
00:00:48,870 --> 00:00:51,390
it's vital that we mean it equally for 
everyone,

17
00:00:51,391 --> 00:00:54,870
not just in an identity,
politics based pecking order.

18
00:00:55,470 --> 00:00:56,303
This device,
this thing that we all have in our 

19
00:00:58,171 --> 00:00:59,004
pocket is bringing us closer together in
ways that were literally unimaginable 

20
00:01:02,911 --> 00:01:04,830
only a generation ago.
Right?

21
00:01:04,831 --> 00:01:05,664
This very second one of you is watching 
this direct message while on the subway 

22
00:01:09,061 --> 00:01:09,894
in New York City.
One of you is listening to the podcast 

23
00:01:11,941 --> 00:01:12,774
while at the gym in London,
and one of you is streaming this while 

24
00:01:15,061 --> 00:01:15,894
on your couch in Moscow.
Not only are you all tuning in on a 

25
00:01:18,931 --> 00:01:19,764
variety of platforms,
but you're furthering the discussion of 

26
00:01:21,961 --> 00:01:22,794
these ideas on facebook and twitter or 
just by talking with your friends and 

27
00:01:25,981 --> 00:01:26,814
family.
That expansion of our conversations 

28
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:30,353
makes me want to do better work even if 
talking about difficult topics comes at 

29
00:01:34,501 --> 00:01:38,220
both a personal and professional cost.
As the world has gotten smaller,

30
00:01:38,221 --> 00:01:39,054
it has never been more important to hear
voices that challenge our thinking and 

31
00:01:41,761 --> 00:01:45,180
give unique perspective based on their 
own personal story.

32
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:47,240
My guest this week is enough ship 
Chanko.

33
00:01:47,260 --> 00:01:50,520
INA is the leader of the women's 
Movement Feminine International,

34
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:51,533
a columnist for the international 
business times and a free speech 

35
00:01:54,151 --> 00:01:57,060
activist.
She was born in Ukraine in the same year

36
00:01:57,061 --> 00:02:01,410
that the USSR fell,
has been kidnapped by the Bellaruse Kgb,

37
00:02:01,411 --> 00:02:04,800
and in 2013 was granted political asylum
in France.

38
00:02:05,190 --> 00:02:06,023
She has lived a truly controversial life
and paid the price for being outspoken 

39
00:02:10,891 --> 00:02:13,980
more than once.
This is not someone who only talks about

40
00:02:13,981 --> 00:02:16,560
the news.
This is someone who actually lives it.

41
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:17,753
There are many issues I want to discuss 
with INA from women's rights and free 

42
00:02:20,371 --> 00:02:22,890
speech to Islamism and political 
correctness,

43
00:02:23,070 --> 00:02:26,010
but I also want to talk to her about 
life in France right now.

44
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:28,650
Has it changed since the Paris terror 
attacks?

45
00:02:28,651 --> 00:02:29,484
What's the political climate?
Has the regressive mentality steeped 

46
00:02:32,281 --> 00:02:33,114
into the mainstream,
thus weakening free speech and helping 

47
00:02:35,701 --> 00:02:36,810
the authoritarians.

48
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:37,913
The only way we can find answers to 
questions like these is to be connected 

49
00:02:40,711 --> 00:02:44,070
with people who aren't afraid to share 
their views.

50
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:45,233
You know there's a catch 22 to all this 
connectivity as it brings us closer and 

51
00:02:48,211 --> 00:02:49,044
transcends cultures and borders.
It can also make everyone else's 

52
00:02:51,661 --> 00:02:54,540
problems seemed like our own.
On one hand,

53
00:02:54,541 --> 00:02:58,260
we can see how others live and have 
empathy for our fellow men.

54
00:02:58,320 --> 00:02:59,153
On the other hand,
sometimes it's hard to gauge just how 

55
00:03:01,571 --> 00:03:06,010
much something across the globe should 
affect us in our day to day lives.

56
00:03:06,310 --> 00:03:07,143
I try to do this show each week in the 
spirit of finding balance between those 

57
00:03:10,241 --> 00:03:14,170
two concepts and I hope you know,
we'll provide perspective on some of the

58
00:03:14,171 --> 00:03:15,004
big questions I've mentioned here.
The more we focus on our common 

59
00:03:18,071 --> 00:03:18,904
humanity,
the less chance we'll be able to be 

60
00:03:20,771 --> 00:03:21,604
ripped apart.
Initiative Chanko is the leader of the 

61
00:03:27,130 --> 00:03:28,210
International Women's movement,
Feminine,

62
00:03:28,270 --> 00:03:29,650
a writer,
a speaker,

63
00:03:29,651 --> 00:03:32,290
and a fearless free speech advocate.
You know,

64
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:33,153
welcome to the show.

65
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:33,931
Hello.
Hi.

66
00:03:33,931 --> 00:03:37,260
Thank you for invitation for long I 
should say.

67
00:03:38,310 --> 00:03:40,260
Well,
I'm really glad that we connected.

68
00:03:40,261 --> 00:03:41,094
I,
I've known about your work for awhile 

69
00:03:42,150 --> 00:03:42,983
and then I saw a piece that you wrote in
the International Business Times last 

70
00:03:45,690 --> 00:03:48,780
week about the regressive left and the 
racist right.

71
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:51,880
And that basically most of us are in 
between and that's very much what,

72
00:03:52,110 --> 00:03:53,880
what we've been talking about here on 
this show.

73
00:03:53,881 --> 00:03:56,250
So I thought it would be a perfect time 
to talk to you.

74
00:03:56,251 --> 00:03:57,810
So you're,
you're in Austria right now,

75
00:03:57,811 --> 00:04:00,110
is that right?
I'm right now in Australia.

76
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:03,240
What?
Can I ask what you're doing there?

77
00:04:03,241 --> 00:04:04,590
Or is this a top secret mission?

78
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:05,913
Yeah,
no,

79
00:04:06,060 --> 00:04:06,893
I'm,
I'm here for a conference about free 

80
00:04:08,331 --> 00:04:09,164
speech of course.
I hope that this time it will not be 

81
00:04:11,211 --> 00:04:12,044
interrupted by a terrorist.
We will be speaking and enjoy this 

82
00:04:16,761 --> 00:04:18,260
topic.
Discussing this topic.

83
00:04:18,340 --> 00:04:19,173
Alright,
well we're going to talk about some of 

84
00:04:19,901 --> 00:04:20,734
the interruptions that you've had a by 
terrorists when you're giving talks on 

85
00:04:24,341 --> 00:04:25,174
free speech.
But first let's do a little bit on your 

86
00:04:26,981 --> 00:04:29,050
biography because I think it's pretty 
amazing.

87
00:04:29,051 --> 00:04:32,530
I mentioned at the top of the show you 
were born in Ukraine,

88
00:04:32,531 --> 00:04:33,364
not the Ukraine.
You were born in Ukraine the same year 

89
00:04:35,771 --> 00:04:40,420
that the Soviet Union fell and I think 
that had a lot to do with sort of your,

90
00:04:40,690 --> 00:04:41,523
your path right now because of things 
that you saw in a sort of newborn 

91
00:04:44,291 --> 00:04:45,124
country.
So can you talk a little bit about your 

92
00:04:46,061 --> 00:04:46,894
history first?

93
00:04:47,740 --> 00:04:48,573
Well,
I was born the year my country was born 

94
00:04:50,831 --> 00:04:52,720
actually.
And um,

95
00:04:52,930 --> 00:04:55,120
of course the situation,
you know,

96
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:57,190
for me as a child,
for me it was just,

97
00:04:57,250 --> 00:04:58,083
just a childhood,
but for adults it was of course a rough 

98
00:05:01,571 --> 00:05:02,404
reality.
Then later I understood that I had a 

99
00:05:04,631 --> 00:05:06,490
rough childhood.
However,

100
00:05:06,580 --> 00:05:07,413
you know,
for me to make a homework under the 

101
00:05:08,981 --> 00:05:09,814
candles because all our electricity in 
the city was shot for the sake of the 

102
00:05:15,490 --> 00:05:16,600
economy.
You know,

103
00:05:16,601 --> 00:05:20,020
we didn't have,
we didn't have a national currency.

104
00:05:20,021 --> 00:05:21,450
And uh,
uh,

105
00:05:21,460 --> 00:05:26,460
my parents were a receiving salary with 
sausages or was breads,

106
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:29,890
you know.
And um,

107
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:31,180
yeah,
I mean,

108
00:05:31,750 --> 00:05:33,850
poverty.
I'm powered to a spot that,

109
00:05:33,890 --> 00:05:34,930
you know,
and uh,

110
00:05:34,931 --> 00:05:39,560
I think that this is not something 
special for yeah to,

111
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:42,300
to tell you about because still until 
today,

112
00:05:42,370 --> 00:05:47,370
many people live in poverty and 25 years
after Ukraine,

113
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:48,473
um,
well actually right now in a similar 

114
00:05:50,081 --> 00:05:52,120
situation and uh,
you know,

115
00:05:52,121 --> 00:05:56,890
already my nephew,
a small child who is eight years old,

116
00:05:56,891 --> 00:05:57,724
he near in this similar situation and 
has similar childhood to what I had so 

117
00:06:02,710 --> 00:06:05,210
situation is that really changing and 
progressing.

118
00:06:05,210 --> 00:06:10,210
But of course it had a really a huge 
impact on me.

119
00:06:10,461 --> 00:06:11,051
And,
uh,

120
00:06:11,051 --> 00:06:15,080
I think when the old generation that was
born after the collapse of the USSR,

121
00:06:15,830 --> 00:06:19,790
because we saw what we saw that,
um,

122
00:06:19,910 --> 00:06:21,440
you know,
as adults,

123
00:06:21,441 --> 00:06:25,720
we're saying our country was ruled by 
450 idiots.

124
00:06:26,060 --> 00:06:29,000
This is,
I'm quoting particularly,

125
00:06:29,001 --> 00:06:31,070
yeah,
my grandma and my mother,

126
00:06:31,071 --> 00:06:34,550
they were calling them all adults.
We're calling politicians always,

127
00:06:34,730 --> 00:06:35,563
you know,
there was always this clear gap between 

128
00:06:36,921 --> 00:06:41,921
society and those 450 Egypt's again,
as they say.

129
00:06:42,430 --> 00:06:43,263
Um,
there was always a gambit between 

130
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:47,990
government and citizens and,
um,

131
00:06:47,991 --> 00:06:49,760
you could,
you as a child,

132
00:06:49,761 --> 00:06:53,990
I never could imagine that it could be 
any connection between those people,

133
00:06:53,991 --> 00:06:58,410
between this small group of people that 
we could call one percent and 99 percent

134
00:06:58,411 --> 00:06:59,244
of the population.
There was all this an impression as if 

135
00:07:02,091 --> 00:07:03,800
we were living in different countries.

136
00:07:04,070 --> 00:07:05,600
I saw,
of course,

137
00:07:05,601 --> 00:07:06,434
you know,
I grew up in a very traditional society 

138
00:07:09,981 --> 00:07:14,981
where woman has to work and uh,
well to have job and also of course take

139
00:07:16,011 --> 00:07:16,844
care of everything at home.
And even though my father was not a 

140
00:07:19,610 --> 00:07:20,443
particular patriarch,
but of course all the while my mother 

141
00:07:23,301 --> 00:07:24,900
was a housewife.
Um,

142
00:07:24,980 --> 00:07:28,790
as well as I'm working full time and in 
nineties,

143
00:07:29,090 --> 00:07:30,530
um,
during,

144
00:07:30,830 --> 00:07:33,410
well during this time of,
you know,

145
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:36,920
trying to create a government in the 
country,

146
00:07:36,921 --> 00:07:41,450
have to collapse a few ceasar parents 
had to work on different jobs and uh,

147
00:07:41,451 --> 00:07:43,850
my,
my mother was working on three different

148
00:07:43,851 --> 00:07:46,190
jobs and of course taking care of us at 
home,

149
00:07:46,191 --> 00:07:48,560
which of course gave an impression,
um,

150
00:07:48,620 --> 00:07:50,000
and kind of,
you know,

151
00:07:51,350 --> 00:07:52,183
well yeah,
we had to paint a picture of what woman 

152
00:07:54,570 --> 00:07:58,640
is supposed to do and what her mission 
is and what men is supposed to do.

153
00:07:58,641 --> 00:08:00,830
And even in such a hard economically 
time,

154
00:08:01,070 --> 00:08:01,903
my father was of course earning much 
more and had access to more jobs and 

155
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:10,070
could,
could have possibility to find different

156
00:08:10,071 --> 00:08:12,350
jobs.
More interesting than my mother.

157
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:13,273
Women really were doing two jobs because
they were working and they were taking 

158
00:08:16,791 --> 00:08:18,770
care of the home and the kids and all 
that.

159
00:08:18,771 --> 00:08:19,470
Yeah,

160
00:08:19,470 --> 00:08:20,230
I don't,
I,

161
00:08:20,230 --> 00:08:21,063
yeah,
I think it's incorrect to speak in the 

162
00:08:22,391 --> 00:08:23,224
past because as I already decided,
remains the realities still a exactly 

163
00:08:27,981 --> 00:08:30,790
the same.
And maybe sometimes we have an illusion,

164
00:08:30,791 --> 00:08:31,624
you know,
expect in a different cover and we can 

165
00:08:33,611 --> 00:08:37,150
see more women who do not do that.
However,

166
00:08:37,180 --> 00:08:40,090
still a majority of women live that 
life.

167
00:08:40,091 --> 00:08:44,590
And My mother's still continues to work 
in two different jobs today.

168
00:08:44,591 --> 00:08:46,930
And uh,
well she doesn't have children anymore.

169
00:08:46,931 --> 00:08:47,764
We're going.

170
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:49,273
So I don't think you think there's 
anything wrong with that in and of 

171
00:08:51,501 --> 00:08:52,334
itself.
You just sort of want people to 

172
00:08:53,271 --> 00:08:55,560
acknowledge the role of the woman,
right?

173
00:08:57,130 --> 00:08:58,480
What do you mean?
I don't think

174
00:08:58,890 --> 00:09:02,060
well that they're doing that they're 
doing both these things that they,

175
00:09:02,061 --> 00:09:05,580
it's not bad to take care of your kids 
in and of itself,

176
00:09:05,581 --> 00:09:06,220
right?

177
00:09:06,220 --> 00:09:07,890
Oh,
too bad to take care of your kids.

178
00:09:07,891 --> 00:09:12,180
But it's bad if you're the only one this
post to take care of your kid.

179
00:09:12,330 --> 00:09:12,580
Right?

180
00:09:12,580 --> 00:09:13,990
So the role,
the role.

181
00:09:14,340 --> 00:09:14,641
Well,
yeah,

182
00:09:14,641 --> 00:09:18,660
exactly that you have to follow the role
and you have no choice.

183
00:09:18,750 --> 00:09:20,300
And uh,
um,

184
00:09:20,310 --> 00:09:21,100
I think,
uh,

185
00:09:21,100 --> 00:09:23,550
I think there's a lot of things that are
wrong in this,

186
00:09:23,551 --> 00:09:26,520
in this concept and in this reality.
And therefore,

187
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:28,150
uh,
we are,

188
00:09:28,770 --> 00:09:32,250
we started a movement in Ukraine as a 
women's movement,

189
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:33,353
feminist movement,
even though at the beginning I should 

190
00:09:35,341 --> 00:09:36,174
confess when we started our activity,
we didn't really have a clear 

191
00:09:39,061 --> 00:09:42,930
understanding what feminism was about 
because for example,

192
00:09:42,931 --> 00:09:44,030
to give you,
um,

193
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:45,480
yeah,
to give you an example,

194
00:09:45,481 --> 00:09:47,560
I was studying in the Best University of
Ukraine.

195
00:09:47,580 --> 00:09:51,480
I was studying journalism and uh,
four years of my studies,

196
00:09:51,690 --> 00:09:56,690
I never had it been even one hour 
lecture on what feminism is.

197
00:09:56,900 --> 00:09:57,733
Wow.
I didn't even hear the definition of 

198
00:09:59,491 --> 00:10:00,324
sanctuary ideology because that was 
something which is not close to Eastern 

199
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:05,933
European society again,
where women have to be at home and take 

200
00:10:09,721 --> 00:10:14,460
care of who have family but not go into 
street and demand their rights.

201
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:15,593
Um,
actually it's not concerning only 

202
00:10:17,430 --> 00:10:18,263
women's rights,
but generally I grew up in the country 

203
00:10:20,731 --> 00:10:25,731
where people do not until 2008 and 2004,
sorry.

204
00:10:27,250 --> 00:10:29,160
Uh,
the moment of orange revolution.

205
00:10:29,161 --> 00:10:33,150
The first revolution that happened in 
the history of independent Ukraine.

206
00:10:33,151 --> 00:10:36,840
Until that moment people didn't have a,
you know,

207
00:10:36,841 --> 00:10:39,270
to,
to protest was a,

208
00:10:39,570 --> 00:10:41,860
you know,
an activity of a bad taste,

209
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:45,200
you know,
it was something that you wouldn't do.

210
00:10:45,230 --> 00:10:47,220
It was something that you would do only 
to,

211
00:10:47,470 --> 00:10:52,470
I'm probably earn money because 
political parties in Ukraine pay you for

212
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:56,860
I'm sending was the flags in the streets
and protesting supporting one or another

213
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:57,713
politician.
So when we started our activity we were 

214
00:11:00,570 --> 00:11:01,403
of course accused accused for being paid
by someone and being political project 

215
00:11:06,090 --> 00:11:06,923
or also being named by our parents or 
relatives who knew that we don't get 

216
00:11:11,011 --> 00:11:14,790
money for that.
We were just simply named either witches

217
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,760
or psychologically sick girls.

218
00:11:17,860 --> 00:11:18,461
Right.
Okay.

219
00:11:18,461 --> 00:11:20,590
So I don't want to jump too far ahead 
yet.

220
00:11:20,591 --> 00:11:21,760
So we're going,
we're going to go into.

221
00:11:21,790 --> 00:11:22,623
We're going to go into all that,
but just to sort of wrap up the Ukraine 

222
00:11:24,851 --> 00:11:25,840
part because I think a lot,
you know,

223
00:11:25,841 --> 00:11:28,360
there's so much happening with Ukraine 
and as you said,

224
00:11:28,361 --> 00:11:29,194
it is a young country.
It's only 25 years old in terms of 

225
00:11:31,811 --> 00:11:32,644
independence.
What do you make of what's happening in 

226
00:11:34,961 --> 00:11:36,340
Ukraine now?
Because it,

227
00:11:36,341 --> 00:11:41,080
it sort of seems like the quest for true
independence in a way has failed because

228
00:11:41,081 --> 00:11:43,420
Russia is,
is back in Ukraine.

229
00:11:43,421 --> 00:11:44,560
Right.
So is it,

230
00:11:44,830 --> 00:11:45,663
do you feel like you're part that 
Ukraine is really an independent state 

231
00:11:48,221 --> 00:11:49,054
at this point?

232
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:50,583
Well,
Ukraine is an independent state and I 

233
00:11:51,941 --> 00:11:54,580
think that nobody should it.
Um,

234
00:11:54,610 --> 00:11:57,130
well,
of course putting questions in Russia is

235
00:11:57,131 --> 00:11:58,100
questioning it.
Yeah.

236
00:11:58,810 --> 00:12:01,090
But,
so Ukraine is an independent state,

237
00:12:01,091 --> 00:12:03,820
of course,
even though our territory,

238
00:12:03,900 --> 00:12:07,180
we're already taking an occupied like 
Crimea,

239
00:12:07,420 --> 00:12:08,253
um,
work presently occupied in Ukraine last 

240
00:12:12,050 --> 00:12:12,883
right now and still there is the eastern
part of Ukraine occupied by a Russian 

241
00:12:16,451 --> 00:12:19,260
military troops and I will say bravely,
uh,

242
00:12:19,270 --> 00:12:21,910
I will claim that their Russian troops 
as it was proven,

243
00:12:22,260 --> 00:12:23,290
um,
well,

244
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:24,153
Ukraine is an independent state,
which is definitely at the stage of its 

245
00:12:28,271 --> 00:12:30,790
development and creation and,
you know,

246
00:12:30,791 --> 00:12:35,791
choosing the path a while 99 percent of 
population today,

247
00:12:35,831 --> 00:12:37,710
a screaming,
oh,

248
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:42,720
for your integration and for wish to 
join European Union or a dream because I

249
00:12:44,471 --> 00:12:47,080
think it's quite a remote possibility 
yet.

250
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:49,420
Um,
there is still,

251
00:12:49,421 --> 00:12:51,010
um,
the garments,

252
00:12:51,340 --> 00:12:55,420
the one that I mentioned about 450 
agents remain.

253
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:58,240
They remain those people because,
well,

254
00:12:58,241 --> 00:13:00,520
I should say that the problem of my 
country,

255
00:13:00,620 --> 00:13:02,680
what my country,
the country where I was born,

256
00:13:03,070 --> 00:13:03,903
um,
because I don't feel like I have a 

257
00:13:06,161 --> 00:13:07,330
country.
Um,

258
00:13:07,750 --> 00:13:10,620
I think that the problem of this country
is that a,

259
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:15,720
for 25 years at least I observed the 
same faces in the parliament.

260
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:21,720
I hear the same names of politicians.
It's the country is ruled by the same.

261
00:13:22,841 --> 00:13:24,370
If you want,
you know,

262
00:13:24,510 --> 00:13:27,490
methia oligarch who,
unions fractions,

263
00:13:27,610 --> 00:13:30,370
for example,
today's President Poroshenko,

264
00:13:30,410 --> 00:13:31,470
who's,
you know,

265
00:13:32,140 --> 00:13:37,140
supposed to be and he claims to be the 
one who is for your integration.

266
00:13:37,391 --> 00:13:38,224
Um,
he was a minister of foreign affairs in 

267
00:13:40,961 --> 00:13:41,810
the,
uh,

268
00:13:41,930 --> 00:13:46,930
cabinets in a parliament of President 
Yanukovych who was recently the dictator

269
00:13:46,991 --> 00:13:51,991
against who people went out recently.
I'm at the square in my down and key up.

270
00:13:52,151 --> 00:13:52,984
So definitely I,
I should say that this sort of 

271
00:13:55,061 --> 00:13:56,020
evolution,
you know,

272
00:13:56,050 --> 00:13:57,730
I think that it's,
it's a,

273
00:13:57,880 --> 00:14:01,060
uh,
intellectually unfair and wrong to think

274
00:14:01,061 --> 00:14:01,894
that after people go out and destroy the
evolution is when people go out on the 

275
00:14:05,861 --> 00:14:06,461
street.
Well,

276
00:14:06,461 --> 00:14:08,110
no,
it's beginning of it.

277
00:14:08,111 --> 00:14:08,944
It's,
it's beginning of the protests and I 

278
00:14:10,451 --> 00:14:11,284
think that the protests started in 2004,
the first orange revolution 10 years 

279
00:14:15,130 --> 00:14:18,970
after people again went out in the 
street because the changes didn't happen

280
00:14:19,180 --> 00:14:19,990
today.
Again,

281
00:14:19,990 --> 00:14:23,980
many people are deceived because don't 
see rapid changes.

282
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:24,873
But,
uh,

283
00:14:25,150 --> 00:14:29,950
I think that's a mistaken and wrong to 
expect changes right away.

284
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:32,530
I think that's,
I think that Ukraine will have to.

285
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:34,630
We'll have to have few more revolutions.

286
00:14:34,970 --> 00:14:36,320
Yeah.
So speaking of that,

287
00:14:36,321 --> 00:14:37,160
do you,
do you think,

288
00:14:37,161 --> 00:14:37,994
what does the average person in Ukraine 
feel about how the rest of the world 

289
00:14:41,961 --> 00:14:42,794
views them now?
Because I sensed that the people of 

290
00:14:44,841 --> 00:14:47,810
Ukraine want more help from the west and
that,

291
00:14:47,900 --> 00:14:49,850
you know,
in America we talk about it,

292
00:14:49,851 --> 00:14:50,684
you know,
we talked about it for like the two 

293
00:14:51,261 --> 00:14:54,110
weeks that Putin was moving troops in or
whatever.

294
00:14:54,111 --> 00:14:54,944
It was a,
there was a two week window where we 

295
00:14:56,781 --> 00:14:57,860
talk about it now.
It just,

296
00:14:57,861 --> 00:14:58,694
we just completely forget about it.
Is there a disappointment on behalf of 

297
00:15:01,551 --> 00:15:02,384
the people,
sort of how the world has reacted to 

298
00:15:04,611 --> 00:15:05,444
what's happened there?

299
00:15:06,130 --> 00:15:06,821
Well,
of course,

300
00:15:06,821 --> 00:15:08,890
yes,
there is a disappointment because,

301
00:15:08,891 --> 00:15:09,700
um,
you know,

302
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:10,533
people feel that people know that their 
government is actually unable to do 

303
00:15:16,091 --> 00:15:19,180
something to change thing.
And since people give,

304
00:15:19,210 --> 00:15:20,043
you know from this square and my,
there were giving the messages to the 

305
00:15:23,261 --> 00:15:24,094
world,
of course they do expect from other 

306
00:15:26,501 --> 00:15:29,830
states the more powerful or so called 
democratic,

307
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:30,873
who already reached a certain level who 
could help and support and especially 

308
00:15:35,711 --> 00:15:40,711
those who support it verbally,
but do not support support practically.

309
00:15:41,420 --> 00:15:42,221
Uh,
of course,

310
00:15:42,221 --> 00:15:43,960
many people are,
as I said,

311
00:15:43,961 --> 00:15:44,794
deceived and disappointed today.
And even some come to the point when 

312
00:15:48,851 --> 00:15:52,480
they say that a younger core image was 
the dictator,

313
00:15:52,540 --> 00:15:55,750
it was better because at least what to 
eat.

314
00:15:55,751 --> 00:15:57,850
And he did,
his government didn't touch.

315
00:15:58,040 --> 00:15:58,821
Yeah.
So,

316
00:15:58,821 --> 00:15:59,654
so last thought on this and then we're 
gonna move on to some of the feminism 

317
00:16:01,971 --> 00:16:02,781
stuff.
I mean,

318
00:16:02,781 --> 00:16:04,430
wasn't,
am I correct me if I'm wrong,

319
00:16:04,431 --> 00:16:05,264
but I think didn't Ukraine have nukes,
which they gave up as part of that they 

320
00:16:09,711 --> 00:16:13,340
would get NATO protection once they were
an independent nation and basically that

321
00:16:13,341 --> 00:16:14,660
just didn't happen.
Right?

322
00:16:14,870 --> 00:16:15,703
So they sort of gave up their protection
that the weapons that would have 

323
00:16:18,471 --> 00:16:21,830
protected them and then they get this 
invasion or whatever you want to call it

324
00:16:21,831 --> 00:16:25,550
from Russia and now the other countries 
right there doing nothing.

325
00:16:25,551 --> 00:16:26,840
We're doing nothing.
So it was,

326
00:16:26,930 --> 00:16:28,000
it was really like,
uh,

327
00:16:28,001 --> 00:16:29,870
an unfortunate decision I suppose.

328
00:16:30,770 --> 00:16:31,440
Well,
uh,

329
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:32,480
I'm in,
uh,

330
00:16:32,481 --> 00:16:36,260
if we will go right now in discussing 
about a decision or NATO,

331
00:16:36,261 --> 00:16:38,840
I think it will be too complex.
Okay.

332
00:16:39,350 --> 00:16:40,970
Fair enough.
Or because,

333
00:16:41,260 --> 00:16:42,093
uh,
well there are a lot of sides of this 

334
00:16:43,411 --> 00:16:44,244
question,
but yes,

335
00:16:44,270 --> 00:16:45,770
this is what happened.
And,

336
00:16:45,771 --> 00:16:46,790
uh,
of course,

337
00:16:46,791 --> 00:16:47,624
many people today thinking back and 
think that what kind of mistakes we're 

338
00:16:51,261 --> 00:16:52,094
done,
but at that moment it seemed to be very 

339
00:16:54,561 --> 00:16:57,560
correct to a decision because,
uh,

340
00:16:57,561 --> 00:16:58,394
you know,
nobody could expect that Putin suddenly 

341
00:17:00,590 --> 00:17:01,423
I'm decides to occupy the territory is 
proved the world that he's even bigger 

342
00:17:06,190 --> 00:17:08,660
dictator then into the world.
Perceive him.

343
00:17:08,990 --> 00:17:09,291
Okay,
well,

344
00:17:09,291 --> 00:17:11,270
I know we can talk about that political 
stuff forever.

345
00:17:11,271 --> 00:17:12,104
So let's,
let's move on to this stuff that you're 

346
00:17:13,221 --> 00:17:16,640
really passionate about.
And it's funny because at the top of the

347
00:17:16,641 --> 00:17:17,474
show I do my direct message where I give
my feelings of the week and I wrote my 

348
00:17:20,990 --> 00:17:24,080
little piece about it yesterday.
And then right after I wrote it,

349
00:17:24,081 --> 00:17:24,914
I watched your Ted talk and basically 
your Ted talk was a 20 minute sort of 

350
00:17:29,750 --> 00:17:33,320
much broader version of exactly what I 
happened to write about yesterday by,

351
00:17:33,350 --> 00:17:36,290
by total coincidence.
And I know that the things that you talk

352
00:17:36,291 --> 00:17:37,124
about are the things that I'm incredibly
passionate about and that I've made the 

353
00:17:38,971 --> 00:17:41,240
show that.
So you had a great quote in your,

354
00:17:41,241 --> 00:17:42,074
in your Ted Talk,
you said that feminine is a movement 

355
00:17:45,231 --> 00:17:48,290
that is trying to rebuild society 
without permission.

356
00:17:48,650 --> 00:17:49,483
I love that line.
So can you just expand on that a little 

357
00:17:52,291 --> 00:17:53,124
bit and what,
what made you start feminine and where 

358
00:17:54,841 --> 00:17:55,674
do you think it's going?

359
00:17:56,580 --> 00:17:58,350
Well,
particularly by that statement,

360
00:17:58,351 --> 00:18:03,351
I should say that anyone who is dreaming
to rebuild the world should come.

361
00:18:03,931 --> 00:18:04,764
That you know,
you should not ask for permission 

362
00:18:06,361 --> 00:18:11,361
because nobody will ever give it to you.
So if you dream to change something,

363
00:18:11,431 --> 00:18:12,264
you should not ask for permission or 
weight when someone will give you that 

364
00:18:16,251 --> 00:18:16,540
impression

365
00:18:16,540 --> 00:18:17,600
waiting a long time.

366
00:18:18,050 --> 00:18:20,030
Right?
And it will never happen.

367
00:18:20,031 --> 00:18:20,960
Yes.
Because,

368
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:22,790
well,
in Ukraine as,

369
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:23,633
as I said,
we started in Ukraine a movement in 

370
00:18:25,701 --> 00:18:30,030
2008.
I'm aware existed movement already exist

371
00:18:30,050 --> 00:18:34,610
for eight years and um,
I should say that's the one we started.

372
00:18:34,611 --> 00:18:35,444
We didn't have any particular knowledge 
of political knowledge or didn't know 

373
00:18:41,091 --> 00:18:44,720
how to work with media.
I told you already did that.

374
00:18:44,721 --> 00:18:47,190
We didn't really have a clear,
uh,

375
00:18:47,230 --> 00:18:50,690
understanding what feminism is about.
Um,

376
00:18:50,750 --> 00:18:51,800
and,
um,

377
00:18:51,860 --> 00:18:52,693
I don't feel embarrassed or shy to say 
about that because I think that this 

378
00:18:56,031 --> 00:19:00,560
should show and reflect the society in 
which we were growing up.

379
00:19:00,890 --> 00:19:01,723
Um,
I remember joining this little group 

380
00:19:05,330 --> 00:19:08,540
about,
which nobody knew at that moment yet.

381
00:19:08,590 --> 00:19:09,423
Um,
we were when we had the meeting in a 

382
00:19:12,441 --> 00:19:15,460
very Soviet style cafe in the center of 
Kiev,

383
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:20,300
sharing two cups of tea,
a on 50 for 15 of us because we were all

384
00:19:20,301 --> 00:19:25,190
young students coming from small cities 
to keep dreaming that this will be the,

385
00:19:25,620 --> 00:19:26,453
the,
the place where we will have is women 

386
00:19:27,621 --> 00:19:28,400
opportunities.

387
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:32,780
And the only opportunities we will 
propose even in this big city in capital

388
00:19:32,781 --> 00:19:34,260
that looked for us,
you know,

389
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:35,900
huge,
tremendous,

390
00:19:36,310 --> 00:19:37,240
uh,
place.

391
00:19:37,300 --> 00:19:38,430
Um,
we,

392
00:19:38,510 --> 00:19:42,800
we only had the opportunity as well 
similar to those that I saw,

393
00:19:42,940 --> 00:19:43,773
um,
the opportunities that women had in my 

394
00:19:45,621 --> 00:19:46,401
childhood,
you know,

395
00:19:46,401 --> 00:19:48,860
to serve someone.
And of course,

396
00:19:48,861 --> 00:19:50,980
very often Ukrainian women are,
uh,

397
00:19:51,110 --> 00:19:52,000
because,
uh,

398
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:55,190
mainly claim that they are beautiful.
But what is true,

399
00:19:55,191 --> 00:20:00,191
they're not educated and poor.
And this becomes a reason to involve,

400
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:03,710
usually involve women in sexual 
exploitation,

401
00:20:03,740 --> 00:20:05,270
prostitution.
And of course,

402
00:20:05,530 --> 00:20:06,590
um,
you know,

403
00:20:06,591 --> 00:20:09,510
on my way to university everyday,
all right,

404
00:20:09,770 --> 00:20:11,660
I could be here,
first of all,

405
00:20:11,661 --> 00:20:15,040
harassed second,
received many flyers,

406
00:20:15,410 --> 00:20:16,340
uh,
from,

407
00:20:16,341 --> 00:20:19,520
uh,
what pimps or brothers who would propose

408
00:20:19,521 --> 00:20:24,521
you to go to work and many women,
many girls did a goal and you know,

409
00:20:25,251 --> 00:20:26,084
applied for such a job because you don't
have other disabilities because you're 

410
00:20:29,421 --> 00:20:30,770
not horrible than anything else.

411
00:20:30,770 --> 00:20:35,770
So for us to first reason to start the 
activity was to fight this disease,

412
00:20:35,931 --> 00:20:40,090
this illness of Eastern Europe.
Oh,

413
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:42,790
considering women as sex slaves,
this prostitute.

414
00:20:42,791 --> 00:20:45,770
And we were campaigning against 
prostitution and sex tourism,

415
00:20:46,070 --> 00:20:51,070
which is a really widespread disease in 
Ukraine particularly.

416
00:20:51,700 --> 00:20:52,533
Um,
and we were competing against that 

417
00:20:53,830 --> 00:20:58,300
wearing pink clothes and carrying pink 
balloons and pink flags,

418
00:20:58,301 --> 00:21:01,680
believing that was this pink color.
We will attract attention to,

419
00:21:01,970 --> 00:21:03,310
um,
to this problem.

420
00:21:03,311 --> 00:21:05,080
However,
of course we failed and,

421
00:21:05,081 --> 00:21:05,980
uh,
uh,

422
00:21:05,981 --> 00:21:10,981
organizing protests with hundred,
200 female activists and nobody was even

423
00:21:12,850 --> 00:21:15,850
stopping when they were passing by to 
read our banners.

424
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:16,991
And,
uh,

425
00:21:16,991 --> 00:21:21,190
we were in search of tactics of the 
waste,

426
00:21:21,191 --> 00:21:24,360
how we can attract attention of this 
very political.

427
00:21:24,730 --> 00:21:25,660
Um,
again,

428
00:21:25,661 --> 00:21:30,661
desperate society to something very 
essential to the rights of women,

429
00:21:30,701 --> 00:21:33,910
something that the whole world is 
already talking about,

430
00:21:33,970 --> 00:21:35,290
accepting,
changing,

431
00:21:35,291 --> 00:21:36,550
you know,
adopting laws.

432
00:21:36,910 --> 00:21:38,470
Um,
and uh,

433
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:39,221
yeah,
well,

434
00:21:39,221 --> 00:21:40,970
for two years we,
uh,

435
00:21:40,980 --> 00:21:43,730
we,
we were in desperate search and uh,

436
00:21:44,110 --> 00:21:44,943
um,
in 2010 we saw that the situation in 

437
00:21:47,441 --> 00:21:50,950
Ukraine was changing because I'm the 
dictator,

438
00:21:51,670 --> 00:21:52,503
which we understood later,
dictator Yanukovych was elected as a 

439
00:21:55,211 --> 00:21:56,044
president and distribution was changed.
You could immediately feel the sends 

440
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:00,753
ship in media could immediately feel the
change of political situation and the 

441
00:22:05,501 --> 00:22:08,370
more than the country.
And we understood that,

442
00:22:08,390 --> 00:22:09,223
uh,
we'll probably have to go as a female 

443
00:22:11,081 --> 00:22:11,914
activist as a female.
Voices would probably have to complain 

444
00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:19,920
about something broader or something 
that brings us to this problem,

445
00:22:20,830 --> 00:22:21,663
you know,
more limited problems such as 

446
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:25,680
prostitution and sex tourism.
Um,

447
00:22:25,690 --> 00:22:28,330
something that is to the root of the 
problem,

448
00:22:28,331 --> 00:22:30,820
the political situation,
the economical situation,

449
00:22:30,850 --> 00:22:33,940
those people who bring the society,
uh,

450
00:22:34,210 --> 00:22:37,650
in such state.
So we did our first topless projects,

451
00:22:37,690 --> 00:22:40,510
2010,
to be honest.

452
00:22:40,511 --> 00:22:41,920
Uh,
it was more,

453
00:22:41,921 --> 00:22:46,690
as an experiment.
It was also sort of a scream from inside

454
00:22:47,170 --> 00:22:52,170
and as I said it was,
it was a decision made during this,

455
00:22:53,711 --> 00:22:55,270
you know,
being in a very,

456
00:22:55,340 --> 00:22:56,173
in a desperate search of how to let 
people hear women's voices and their 

457
00:23:00,550 --> 00:23:01,383
problems.

458
00:23:01,430 --> 00:23:05,180
How did that first moment feel for you 
when you did the topless protest?

459
00:23:05,190 --> 00:23:06,023
Because you guys,
even if it hadn't picked up much 

460
00:23:07,311 --> 00:23:09,710
traction,
you were already talking about things as

461
00:23:09,711 --> 00:23:12,470
you've said that we're sort of not 
accepted in society.

462
00:23:12,471 --> 00:23:13,850
So you're already going against the 
grain,

463
00:23:14,060 --> 00:23:14,571
but then,
yeah,

464
00:23:14,571 --> 00:23:15,620
you realized,
all right,

465
00:23:15,621 --> 00:23:18,950
we've got to do something that's going 
to really get us publicity the right way

466
00:23:18,951 --> 00:23:21,410
and all that.
How did literally that first moment when

467
00:23:21,411 --> 00:23:22,940
you took off your top feel?

468
00:23:23,100 --> 00:23:23,933
Well,
I should say that I didn't do that that 

469
00:23:26,011 --> 00:23:31,011
moment because I did it a year after 
because we had a huge discussion in the,

470
00:23:31,320 --> 00:23:32,970
in the group,
um,

471
00:23:33,030 --> 00:23:33,863
well,
sort of in the fights about whether to 

472
00:23:35,551 --> 00:23:36,740
do it or not.
Uh,

473
00:23:37,110 --> 00:23:39,390
uh,
because so,

474
00:23:39,391 --> 00:23:42,330
and I was one of those who were against 
topless protests,

475
00:23:42,331 --> 00:23:43,164
so that came later for me.
But I'm definitely had a huge effect 

476
00:23:46,430 --> 00:23:51,050
because we have now,
we not only had the unpopular speech,

477
00:23:51,110 --> 00:23:54,170
but we also use them very unpopular 
tactic.

478
00:23:54,650 --> 00:23:57,070
We were showing something,
any job,

479
00:23:57,090 --> 00:23:57,923
a woman,
which is very important to learn this 

480
00:23:59,781 --> 00:24:00,614
society.
The image of a woman which was popular 

481
00:24:03,291 --> 00:24:04,850
in Ukraine was the,
you know,

482
00:24:04,851 --> 00:24:06,200
a nice,
smiling,

483
00:24:06,201 --> 00:24:08,540
sexy,
a cleaning lady.

484
00:24:08,790 --> 00:24:09,623
Um,
but so we were showing a screaming and 

485
00:24:12,431 --> 00:24:13,264
grape bare breasted woman.
What was the message was slogan written 

486
00:24:17,031 --> 00:24:18,500
across her chest,
uh,

487
00:24:18,650 --> 00:24:22,460
which was something that was breaking 
completely the definition,

488
00:24:22,520 --> 00:24:22,901
you know,
the,

489
00:24:22,901 --> 00:24:23,631
the,
yeah,

490
00:24:23,631 --> 00:24:24,464
the definition or imagination that the 
contexts in which people could see that 

491
00:24:28,521 --> 00:24:32,510
the woman and the definition of woman in
generally in Ukraine.

492
00:24:32,810 --> 00:24:34,710
And uh,
of course it was a,

493
00:24:34,730 --> 00:24:35,563
it attracted a lot of attention or 
different attention as well as some 

494
00:24:40,221 --> 00:24:42,410
support.
There is support from Ukraine.

495
00:24:42,411 --> 00:24:44,080
And of course,
uh,

496
00:24:44,150 --> 00:24:47,760
we felt a huge support from abroad.
Um,

497
00:24:48,170 --> 00:24:50,800
and a lot of criticism,
of course,

498
00:24:50,870 --> 00:24:51,703
of course we would have been named a 
prostitutes immediately because we were 

499
00:24:54,501 --> 00:24:57,260
naked,
which again revealed something that,

500
00:24:57,530 --> 00:24:59,180
um,
for people,

501
00:24:59,181 --> 00:25:03,710
you know,
naked woman is equal to prostitutes.

502
00:25:03,770 --> 00:25:04,603
And I'm actually,
I should say that it was this topless 

503
00:25:06,771 --> 00:25:08,090
project,
what we are reaching,

504
00:25:08,210 --> 00:25:11,540
I think that we're committing sort of a 
test for democracy.

505
00:25:11,550 --> 00:25:15,650
We commit a test,
we test the society and uh,

506
00:25:16,040 --> 00:25:16,873
uh,
with this tactic was the messages and 

507
00:25:21,110 --> 00:25:24,860
speeches that we have with test society 
and will reveal a lot.

508
00:25:25,190 --> 00:25:28,670
Um,
we reveal a lot on the reaction on those

509
00:25:28,671 --> 00:25:31,280
projects.
So I should say that what we actually do

510
00:25:31,281 --> 00:25:32,114
very often people say feminine are 
violent because we are aggressive 

511
00:25:35,511 --> 00:25:36,620
because we're screaming.

512
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:37,793
I'm so,
which immediately makes the fear that 

513
00:25:40,101 --> 00:25:41,120
for people,
you know,

514
00:25:41,121 --> 00:25:45,440
a woman who is angry is the violence is 
something violent.

515
00:25:45,470 --> 00:25:48,260
We,
you'll find to see angry men,

516
00:25:48,261 --> 00:25:52,220
but with women,
which is not smiling or keeping silent,

517
00:25:52,221 --> 00:25:54,080
but who's screaming is something 
violent.

518
00:25:54,081 --> 00:25:54,914
Really,
a we probably killed were probably 

519
00:26:03,890 --> 00:26:06,770
feeling some people buy our messages.
Um,

520
00:26:06,860 --> 00:26:09,410
I mean,
of course literally we do not harm.

521
00:26:09,411 --> 00:26:11,170
We do not,
we do not interact,

522
00:26:11,340 --> 00:26:15,440
you know,
we don't touch anyone physically.

523
00:26:15,441 --> 00:26:19,580
We can touch and attack ideas.
We buy our ideas,

524
00:26:19,581 --> 00:26:23,660
but what actually do is we appear take 
off our top and strip.

525
00:26:23,661 --> 00:26:26,360
Our ID is written and our buddies we 
create.

526
00:26:26,630 --> 00:26:29,960
I think that we transform our bodies in 
the political messages,

527
00:26:29,961 --> 00:26:33,200
in our manifesto,
in posters if you want this.

528
00:26:33,260 --> 00:26:36,230
These are posters on which we write our 
slogans.

529
00:26:36,530 --> 00:26:38,350
And uh,
I think this way we,

530
00:26:38,390 --> 00:26:39,920
I think it's kind of,
yeah,

531
00:26:39,921 --> 00:26:44,550
there are a few functions because the 
first function of course is to provoke,

532
00:26:44,700 --> 00:26:45,780
to attract attention.

533
00:26:45,780 --> 00:26:50,720
Second is that we change the meaning of 
what naked budget it is.

534
00:26:51,090 --> 00:26:53,550
It's not.
There are so many.

535
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:54,833
You can see women,
naked women everywhere on covers of 

536
00:26:57,600 --> 00:26:59,160
magazines,
on billboards.

537
00:26:59,190 --> 00:27:01,710
They opposing smiling,
sexy.

538
00:27:02,040 --> 00:27:05,550
What we're showing,
we're showing woman who's not sexy,

539
00:27:05,551 --> 00:27:06,640
but uh,
you know,

540
00:27:06,650 --> 00:27:09,270
she's political her by this political.
She's not smiling,

541
00:27:09,271 --> 00:27:14,271
she's screaming,
she's not inviting you to use her.

542
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:17,430
She's refusing.
She is showing her anger.

543
00:27:17,431 --> 00:27:19,560
She's showing that she's demanding 
something.

544
00:27:20,070 --> 00:27:24,570
And of course this is something that 
breaks a lot of stereotypes and rules.

545
00:27:24,571 --> 00:27:25,404
And traditions in particularly in 
society like Ukraine have generally in 

546
00:27:30,121 --> 00:27:33,150
many countries,
we received a very different reaction of

547
00:27:33,151 --> 00:27:35,400
such protests and I think it reveals a 
lot.

548
00:27:35,401 --> 00:27:36,570
It mirrors a lot.

549
00:27:36,810 --> 00:27:37,643
Well,
what's interesting is you're really 

550
00:27:38,371 --> 00:27:43,170
talking about the true roots of what 
feminism really is.

551
00:27:43,410 --> 00:27:47,640
You are demanding to be accepted as an 
absolute equal to a man,

552
00:27:47,641 --> 00:27:52,380
which really is what you first wave 
feminism here in the west was.

553
00:27:52,381 --> 00:27:55,140
It's now changed and morphed into 
something else.

554
00:27:55,290 --> 00:27:58,260
But all you're demanding sort of is 
equality.

555
00:27:58,560 --> 00:27:59,393
Um,
I've seen you described as a sex 

556
00:28:00,900 --> 00:28:02,760
streaming.
Do you like that word?

557
00:28:02,790 --> 00:28:04,830
Do you guys,
you've used that word a little bit,

558
00:28:04,831 --> 00:28:06,720
but I've heard it about you more.

559
00:28:08,570 --> 00:28:09,403
Alright.
Well this is the word that we created 

560
00:28:12,371 --> 00:28:13,450
actually,
and we're done.

561
00:28:14,170 --> 00:28:17,450
It defines itself is sex drummist.
Um,

562
00:28:17,480 --> 00:28:18,313
because we use our sex,
the fact that we have female as our 

563
00:28:21,110 --> 00:28:23,240
weapons.
Our God is our weapons.

564
00:28:23,241 --> 00:28:24,074
And I think this is also sort of a not 
unser to fundamentalist terrorists who 

565
00:28:28,191 --> 00:28:31,580
use the gun,
who actually killed people.

566
00:28:31,581 --> 00:28:34,060
We showed them our,
my buddies,

567
00:28:34,070 --> 00:28:35,810
my weapon.
Because first of all,

568
00:28:35,811 --> 00:28:39,320
you are scared of it as if it was 
actually a weapon who,

569
00:28:39,430 --> 00:28:40,263
which could kill you in a second.
We see that this budget really can 

570
00:28:44,451 --> 00:28:46,580
destroy,
um,

571
00:28:47,190 --> 00:28:48,023
you know,
can destroy bad ideas or at least 

572
00:28:49,971 --> 00:28:52,910
challenge them or provoke them a great 
discussion.

573
00:28:52,911 --> 00:28:53,744
So yes,
we call it ourselves is because we use 

574
00:28:56,331 --> 00:28:59,090
our sex,
sex as a weapon,

575
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:00,410
our bodies,
our weapon.

576
00:29:00,660 --> 00:29:01,493
Okay.
So as I mentioned at the top of the 

577
00:29:02,341 --> 00:29:04,170
show,
and as you've illustrated here,

578
00:29:04,410 --> 00:29:05,243
quite obviously,
it's not just that you talk about these 

579
00:29:07,471 --> 00:29:08,304
things,
but you literally are putting your life 

580
00:29:09,871 --> 00:29:10,704
on the line.
I mean,

581
00:29:10,860 --> 00:29:14,430
just by taking your shirt off,
the amount of people who you've angered,

582
00:29:14,431 --> 00:29:15,510
it's,
it's incredible.

583
00:29:15,511 --> 00:29:16,344
It's crazy.
But you've also had very close brushes 

584
00:29:18,511 --> 00:29:22,110
with the law,
with actual terrorism and violence.

585
00:29:22,260 --> 00:29:25,830
Can you go into a couple examples of the
KGB example in boundaries and just,

586
00:29:25,831 --> 00:29:28,380
and,
and you were literally an event that you

587
00:29:28,381 --> 00:29:30,750
were speaking about,
free speech was shot up.

588
00:29:30,780 --> 00:29:32,820
Uh,
and there's some crazy audio of that.

589
00:29:32,970 --> 00:29:34,440
Can you just talk about those two 
examples?

590
00:29:36,360 --> 00:29:36,751
Well,
yes,

591
00:29:36,751 --> 00:29:40,440
I think,
I think this is what I was talking about

592
00:29:40,470 --> 00:29:43,740
that will reveal a lot of things with 
this protest,

593
00:29:43,741 --> 00:29:46,270
but to be honest,
we didn't expect that we will,

594
00:29:46,390 --> 00:29:49,030
you know,
just topless woman was the worst written

595
00:29:49,031 --> 00:29:51,220
across the chest,
could um,

596
00:29:51,250 --> 00:29:52,083
you know,
could invite the garments and secret 

597
00:29:53,861 --> 00:29:56,320
services to chase them,
arrest them,

598
00:29:56,321 --> 00:29:57,154
kidnapped them and torture.
We have been literally tortured in 

599
00:29:59,480 --> 00:30:04,480
bellerose after one of our projects that
we staged in December 2011,

600
00:30:06,131 --> 00:30:06,964
which was an anniversary 19 December 
2011 anniversary of a one year 

601
00:30:11,651 --> 00:30:12,484
anniversary for huge German stroke 
patient in the co where during which 

602
00:30:16,271 --> 00:30:17,104
many people have been arrested,
mainly disappeared and some reportedly 

603
00:30:21,011 --> 00:30:21,844
have been killed.
But the information is always hidden 

604
00:30:24,161 --> 00:30:27,910
there.
And we stayed in ironical protest,

605
00:30:27,920 --> 00:30:32,890
mocking a dictator.
Luca Shen come in front of a KGB office,

606
00:30:32,891 --> 00:30:36,840
which is officially official kg be,
um,

607
00:30:36,950 --> 00:30:38,200
a service there.

608
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:39,033
And during the protests,
journalists have been grabbed by the 

609
00:30:43,030 --> 00:30:45,280
staff,
a kgb stuff.

610
00:30:45,310 --> 00:30:48,300
The man who came out of the office of 
KGB and we,

611
00:30:48,330 --> 00:30:50,920
we were ignored so we could leave the 
place.

612
00:30:50,950 --> 00:30:54,780
They certainly knew that they will be 
able to catch us before the,

613
00:30:54,820 --> 00:30:55,653
what was important,
but in that moment for them to stop the 

614
00:30:57,761 --> 00:31:01,180
journalist from releasing the images.
Um,

615
00:31:01,210 --> 00:31:03,700
however,
some journalists managed to do it.

616
00:31:03,701 --> 00:31:06,700
They left before I'm having an 
experience,

617
00:31:06,701 --> 00:31:07,534
obviously working in Belarus and later,
a few hours after when we were at the 

618
00:31:10,241 --> 00:31:11,074
bus station in Maine,
Cisco on our way back to Kiev to 

619
00:31:13,751 --> 00:31:15,220
Ukraine,
um,

620
00:31:15,250 --> 00:31:16,083
we have been grabbed and thrown into bus
in which we spend the whole night of 

621
00:31:21,150 --> 00:31:24,450
being questioned by men.
Um,

622
00:31:25,660 --> 00:31:26,920
well,
we saw their faces.

623
00:31:26,921 --> 00:31:28,410
They didn't hide themselves,
but,

624
00:31:28,411 --> 00:31:29,244
uh,
they were clearly saying that they're 

625
00:31:30,941 --> 00:31:34,790
kgb and they were asking us who paid us 
for this protests.

626
00:31:34,790 --> 00:31:36,670
They were saying that,
uh,

627
00:31:36,671 --> 00:31:41,590
would they know that Europe pays us,
which is ridiculous,

628
00:31:41,591 --> 00:31:42,610
you know,
who is Europe?

629
00:31:42,611 --> 00:31:45,570
I was trying to ask them as well.
They did sir.

630
00:31:45,940 --> 00:31:46,773
Um,
because they were the ones asking 

631
00:31:47,981 --> 00:31:48,814
questions.
So,

632
00:31:48,970 --> 00:31:49,900
um,
yeah.

633
00:31:49,901 --> 00:31:53,380
And uh,
after that night we have been brought to

634
00:31:53,680 --> 00:31:55,120
a forest,
uh,

635
00:31:55,490 --> 00:31:58,330
uh,
in which we changed the buses.

636
00:31:58,331 --> 00:32:02,770
We were taking the bus and there was 
another group of men,

637
00:32:02,890 --> 00:32:05,900
a faces of who we couldn't see anymore,
uh,

638
00:32:06,130 --> 00:32:07,020
because,
um,

639
00:32:07,180 --> 00:32:08,013
the plastic handcuffs and our hands and 
we were not allowed to move and had to 

640
00:32:12,760 --> 00:32:15,640
keep our heads down and looking on the 
floor.

641
00:32:16,420 --> 00:32:19,330
Um,
well we heard during I think five,

642
00:32:19,340 --> 00:32:21,670
six hours drive,
we heard that we will be killed.

643
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,460
We heard the description,
you know,

644
00:32:24,461 --> 00:32:27,510
different description of how we can be 
killed at and uh,

645
00:32:28,010 --> 00:32:29,740
um,
we will ask to,

646
00:32:29,770 --> 00:32:30,603
to breathe loud because they wanted to 
hear us breathing saying that in few 

647
00:32:34,481 --> 00:32:36,040
hours we will not be able to breathe.

648
00:32:36,070 --> 00:32:36,903
They were saying that they will send our
core parts of bodies to our mothers and 

649
00:32:42,561 --> 00:32:43,394
so on and so forth,
which was of course done very 

650
00:32:46,101 --> 00:32:47,560
professionally.
Um,

651
00:32:47,570 --> 00:32:48,403
you know,
you could feel that this man do this 

652
00:32:50,691 --> 00:32:51,524
everyday.
It's their job actually to retort to 

653
00:32:53,521 --> 00:32:55,270
people like that.
Um,

654
00:32:55,980 --> 00:33:00,250
we received a few hits,
but they were not beating us severely,

655
00:33:00,260 --> 00:33:04,130
but later we were taking out of the bus 
in a forest and they're,

656
00:33:04,360 --> 00:33:06,470
um,
what they were.

657
00:33:06,500 --> 00:33:07,333
They were doing a horrible things such 
as putting the blame on us and playing 

658
00:33:14,691 --> 00:33:15,260
very,
you know,

659
00:33:15,260 --> 00:33:17,570
coming with a fire very close to the 
body.

660
00:33:17,571 --> 00:33:21,170
So you feel like you would,
they will burn you alive right now.

661
00:33:21,470 --> 00:33:22,303
They made us undress a turn and so they 
were creating situations when you feel 

662
00:33:28,560 --> 00:33:30,770
like next second they will rape you,
they will burn you,

663
00:33:30,771 --> 00:33:33,600
they will kill you,
they will cut you a,

664
00:33:33,650 --> 00:33:38,650
you know what they did,
they cut my hair was knife,

665
00:33:38,840 --> 00:33:39,830
they were,
you know,

666
00:33:39,831 --> 00:33:44,810
they throw some uh,
know green antiseptic and my face,

667
00:33:44,840 --> 00:33:45,673
which I couldn't wash away or like 
things that were somehow at some point 

668
00:33:50,121 --> 00:33:51,710
with some,
it's ridiculous,

669
00:33:51,711 --> 00:33:54,830
but it was,
it was tortured,

670
00:33:54,860 --> 00:33:57,230
was psychological and physical torture.

671
00:33:57,230 --> 00:33:59,840
They were filming everything on to video
cameras.

672
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:02,930
So it was supposed to be reported to 
someone,

673
00:34:03,290 --> 00:34:04,410
uh,
and uh,

674
00:34:04,460 --> 00:34:05,293
we,
so 15 men around us and masks and the 

675
00:34:07,311 --> 00:34:08,144
fact that they were wearing masks made 
me think that they will not kill us 

676
00:34:11,451 --> 00:34:13,640
because they hide their faces.
Um,

677
00:34:13,670 --> 00:34:14,503
however,
I didn't know how far they will go in 

678
00:34:17,060 --> 00:34:19,460
their action and uh,
they after this torture,

679
00:34:19,461 --> 00:34:24,030
they throw us out of the forest and,
uh,

680
00:34:24,290 --> 00:34:29,290
we spent another five hours,
six hours to find someone and we found a

681
00:34:30,771 --> 00:34:32,470
village,
what village?

682
00:34:32,720 --> 00:34:34,850
It's a big word probably for seven 
houses,

683
00:34:35,150 --> 00:34:37,360
and we were in the middle of the forest.
We found them.

684
00:34:37,361 --> 00:34:38,194
We were lucky enough that at that moment
there was someone who came from the CT 

685
00:34:42,251 --> 00:34:43,084
and had mobile phone and of course for 
24 hours already all at least Russian 

686
00:34:46,761 --> 00:34:51,761
speaking world researching for us and 
information was spread everywhere and we

687
00:34:52,520 --> 00:34:54,890
easily contacted our colleagues and 
journalists.

688
00:34:54,891 --> 00:34:59,891
And later four hours later,
the embassy of Ukraine arrived to police

689
00:35:00,171 --> 00:35:03,620
station,
which we were staying for some time.

690
00:35:03,650 --> 00:35:07,640
And it took us back to Kiev.
Um,

691
00:35:07,730 --> 00:35:10,330
well this is one of the experience,
uh,

692
00:35:10,630 --> 00:35:11,500
um,
you know,

693
00:35:11,501 --> 00:35:13,020
in Ukraine,
um,

694
00:35:13,220 --> 00:35:18,220
also we constantly were falling over by 
secret services,

695
00:35:18,531 --> 00:35:20,380
threatened and uh,
um,

696
00:35:20,890 --> 00:35:24,860
well they opened for criminal cases 
against us for hooliganism.

697
00:35:25,070 --> 00:35:25,903
This is some thing that they use in 
Ukrainian Russia against political 

698
00:35:29,151 --> 00:35:31,430
activist.
For example,

699
00:35:31,431 --> 00:35:32,264
right now the reserve artists pop 
landscape who burned the door of a 

700
00:35:37,231 --> 00:35:38,580
Russian secret service,

701
00:35:38,850 --> 00:35:40,970
um,
and he's also redundancy hooligan.

702
00:35:41,070 --> 00:35:42,770
Well,
they treat us as a whole against,

703
00:35:42,771 --> 00:35:44,560
because this is something very vague,
you know,

704
00:35:44,610 --> 00:35:46,430
you could,
um,

705
00:35:46,950 --> 00:35:50,450
you could pull anyone who like and,
and uh,

706
00:35:50,740 --> 00:35:52,030
yeah.
And then Ukraine,

707
00:35:52,050 --> 00:35:52,810
uh,
uh,

708
00:35:52,810 --> 00:35:57,810
after our first and very loud protest 
against union of Church and state,

709
00:35:58,810 --> 00:36:01,060
um,
I had to flee.

710
00:36:01,150 --> 00:36:03,930
I had to leave the country because,
uh,

711
00:36:04,230 --> 00:36:04,721
uh,
well,

712
00:36:04,721 --> 00:36:09,721
literally I had to jump out from the 
window of my apartment a jump in the car

713
00:36:09,821 --> 00:36:12,680
and run away.
Um,

714
00:36:13,460 --> 00:36:15,020
when this stuff has happened to you,
I mean,

715
00:36:15,021 --> 00:36:15,854
I know you can,
you have so many examples of this which 

716
00:36:18,171 --> 00:36:18,790
we could,
you know,

717
00:36:18,790 --> 00:36:19,623
we could spend hours talking about,
but when these things have happened to 

718
00:36:21,321 --> 00:36:22,040
you,
I mean,

719
00:36:22,040 --> 00:36:24,860
what happened to you in that forest?
It sounds horrific.

720
00:36:24,861 --> 00:36:25,694
You survive,
but obviously their goal is 

721
00:36:26,901 --> 00:36:28,970
intimidation.
Their goal of course,

722
00:36:28,971 --> 00:36:29,804
is to silence you.
And then by silencing you they silence 

723
00:36:32,361 --> 00:36:34,970
your followers and that's how they end 
you guys.

724
00:36:34,971 --> 00:36:38,600
They don't have to actually kill you.
So I'm curious afterwards,

725
00:36:38,601 --> 00:36:43,601
after something like that happens,
do you or did you feel all right,

726
00:36:43,790 --> 00:36:46,910
maybe we've taken this as far as it 
should go or did it,

727
00:36:46,940 --> 00:36:51,110
did you immediately double down and say,
now we're getting somewhere with this?

728
00:36:53,690 --> 00:36:54,523
Well,
of course I'm not going to play a 

729
00:36:55,341 --> 00:36:56,174
superhero.
And of course you have older fear you 

730
00:36:59,241 --> 00:37:03,460
feel you'll feel that I will not right 
after you.

731
00:37:04,150 --> 00:37:07,330
I will never do it again.
Um,

732
00:37:07,610 --> 00:37:09,050
but then,
you know,

733
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:10,033
after some time thinking about it and 
really spending time on repeating in 

734
00:37:14,181 --> 00:37:17,480
your mind what really happened?
You understand that it's not,

735
00:37:17,590 --> 00:37:21,260
it's not us who went too far is their 
reaction goes too far,

736
00:37:21,380 --> 00:37:25,220
probably because we do something which 
they don't want to happen.

737
00:37:25,730 --> 00:37:28,400
And so it means that we do something 
very right.

738
00:37:28,610 --> 00:37:29,840
And I think,
of course,

739
00:37:30,410 --> 00:37:32,690
again,
I will never deny that we have fear.

740
00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:33,553
We do have fear,
but I should say that the fear of the 

741
00:37:36,951 --> 00:37:37,784
fear of giving up to those people is 
much bigger than fear of being taken to 

742
00:37:42,591 --> 00:37:43,424
the forest.
At least you already know how it feels 

743
00:37:45,891 --> 00:37:47,370
and what it is.
Um,

744
00:37:47,840 --> 00:37:49,400
and again,
your fear,

745
00:37:49,401 --> 00:37:50,510
it's a choice,
right?

746
00:37:50,511 --> 00:37:51,344
So we'll probably make a choice not to 
fear but to who to deal with the fear 

747
00:37:59,751 --> 00:38:01,790
and to continue the activity because 
again,

748
00:38:02,030 --> 00:38:06,190
just think about how ridiculous actually
this all is.

749
00:38:06,440 --> 00:38:11,440
There are girls who take off their tops 
and write slogans and for that had taken

750
00:38:11,600 --> 00:38:13,490
to the forest,
KGB staff,

751
00:38:13,491 --> 00:38:18,350
I spending with them 24 hours torturing 
them and doing all the insane things.

752
00:38:18,351 --> 00:38:19,184
How ridiculous this is.
How ridiculous is the fact that there 

753
00:38:22,431 --> 00:38:25,160
are people blending terrorists,
attacks,

754
00:38:25,190 --> 00:38:26,023
taking guns,
blowing themselves up because they want 

755
00:38:28,911 --> 00:38:30,730
to stop those who drove her car

756
00:38:32,200 --> 00:38:33,033
but caricatures do,
you know who drove very funny or not 

757
00:38:36,521 --> 00:38:39,930
funny for some cartoons,
but something so peaceful.

758
00:38:39,940 --> 00:38:43,030
So somehow very childish as well.
You know,

759
00:38:43,031 --> 00:38:47,620
it was something very simple.
So I think that it also reveals a lot of

760
00:38:47,621 --> 00:38:49,030
shows,
um,

761
00:38:49,270 --> 00:38:51,030
how it shows the.
Yeah,

762
00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:54,400
how crippled our society is,
how the,

763
00:38:54,880 --> 00:38:58,750
how we,
we replaced the fight or the.

764
00:38:58,770 --> 00:39:02,110
Yeah,
the fights a of ideas by actually divide

765
00:39:02,140 --> 00:39:04,460
between people.
And uh,

766
00:39:04,461 --> 00:39:07,330
I think that this is the reason to 
continue.

767
00:39:07,490 --> 00:39:09,040
And,
and,

768
00:39:09,041 --> 00:39:09,491
uh,
you know,

769
00:39:09,491 --> 00:39:10,780
sometimes people say,
well,

770
00:39:10,830 --> 00:39:14,770
you're ready to do it for six years and 
you're only 25 and you already have been

771
00:39:14,771 --> 00:39:16,780
nearly killed at least three times.
What,

772
00:39:16,781 --> 00:39:19,360
what makes you go on?
But this actually,

773
00:39:19,390 --> 00:39:20,223
this is exactly the reason that make you
go go on because you understand that 

774
00:39:23,171 --> 00:39:25,060
just because you say,
you know,

775
00:39:25,100 --> 00:39:25,933
you write three words in your body or 
you write an article or you draw a 

776
00:39:28,640 --> 00:39:30,880
cartoon,
they went to kill you for that.

777
00:39:31,030 --> 00:39:31,863
Isn't it ridiculous?
Doesn't make sure that I leave in six 

778
00:39:33,671 --> 00:39:36,400
society and because I don't want to live
in society,

779
00:39:36,401 --> 00:39:37,990
I continue,
I go on,

780
00:39:37,991 --> 00:39:41,320
I know that the history of my time is 
written right now and,

781
00:39:41,321 --> 00:39:44,010
uh,
well to let fundamentalist,

782
00:39:44,130 --> 00:39:48,100
a dictator's misogynists to write 
history of my time.

783
00:39:48,160 --> 00:39:50,710
Well,
I don't agree with that.

784
00:39:50,711 --> 00:39:52,930
I want to participate writing the 
history.

785
00:39:53,510 --> 00:39:54,111
Yeah,
I mean,

786
00:39:54,111 --> 00:39:56,800
listen,
I love everything you just said though.

787
00:39:56,930 --> 00:39:59,540
The whole spirit of everything that I do
is exactly that.

788
00:39:59,541 --> 00:40:01,220
You're at,
you're at the front lines of it.

789
00:40:01,221 --> 00:40:04,490
So that's a good segue actually to,
in 2013,

790
00:40:04,580 --> 00:40:07,580
uh,
you got asylum in France and you live in

791
00:40:07,581 --> 00:40:08,414
France now,
and that must've been an interesting 

792
00:40:10,161 --> 00:40:10,994
time to move to France because shortly 
after that a was the Charlie Hebdo 

793
00:40:14,540 --> 00:40:15,870
attacks.
Now you,

794
00:40:15,871 --> 00:40:17,570
you knew some of the cartoonists,
right?

795
00:40:17,571 --> 00:40:19,550
You had worked with them a little bit.
Um,

796
00:40:19,640 --> 00:40:20,570
so can you talk about that?

797
00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:24,500
Well,
I knew all the Darnest,

798
00:40:24,850 --> 00:40:28,340
um,
those who died and those who survived as

799
00:40:28,341 --> 00:40:29,780
well.
Um,

800
00:40:29,781 --> 00:40:30,800
we had to,
well,

801
00:40:30,801 --> 00:40:31,634
we were friends,
we were really friends and we spend a 

802
00:40:33,951 --> 00:40:38,240
lot of time just together debating,
discussing and sharing what was shared.

803
00:40:38,241 --> 00:40:39,074
A lot of ideas and to be honest,
when I arrived to France and after few 

804
00:40:43,700 --> 00:40:47,720
of protest that we organized in France 
and clearly stated our direct message,

805
00:40:47,870 --> 00:40:48,703
not message,
which is following all these demands of 

806
00:40:51,111 --> 00:40:53,990
political correctness.
No unnecessary political,

807
00:40:53,991 --> 00:40:55,470
correct.
It is.

808
00:40:56,420 --> 00:40:58,280
And you rope.
I'm Charlotte.

809
00:40:58,400 --> 00:40:59,233
We're the only one who were really on 
the same line with us and we became 

810
00:41:03,231 --> 00:41:05,990
really friendly and it's very,
very soon.

811
00:41:05,991 --> 00:41:07,660
And we even made a,
a,

812
00:41:07,700 --> 00:41:10,010
one issue of Charlotte though together 
with feminine.

813
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:11,810
Um,
and uh,

814
00:41:12,200 --> 00:41:13,033
well yeah,
and of course we will sometime we were 

815
00:41:17,511 --> 00:41:18,344
spending ridging to each other,
the threats that we were receiving and 

816
00:41:21,501 --> 00:41:22,334
laughing and making fun of the,
of the fanatics who were spending time 

817
00:41:27,620 --> 00:41:30,410
for writing those threats and uh,
you know,

818
00:41:30,680 --> 00:41:34,190
writing this pitches which they were a 
recording

819
00:41:34,270 --> 00:41:35,420
now.
Voicemails.

820
00:41:35,930 --> 00:41:37,280
Um,
yeah,

821
00:41:37,281 --> 00:41:41,150
and of course losing your friends,
not only friends,

822
00:41:41,240 --> 00:41:42,073
you know.
Yeah,

823
00:41:42,080 --> 00:41:42,913
not only friends,
but I do a logic ideological friends or 

824
00:41:45,261 --> 00:41:46,094
brothers if you want was of course was 
again something which of course it's 

825
00:41:51,050 --> 00:41:54,980
personally very hard and have a,
a lose,

826
00:41:55,030 --> 00:41:56,870
but also is something that reveals the 
Lord,

827
00:41:56,930 --> 00:42:00,140
shows you again,
shows you that if you stop,

828
00:42:01,850 --> 00:42:04,610
then you will fail and new ideas will 
fail.

829
00:42:05,330 --> 00:42:09,200
I believe that maybe it will be,
it will sound a bit old,

830
00:42:10,130 --> 00:42:13,880
but even those cartoonists who died,
who were killed,

831
00:42:13,940 --> 00:42:17,570
they didn't lose and their ideas,
they are not,

832
00:42:17,810 --> 00:42:20,210
the ideas are not failure.
They,

833
00:42:20,300 --> 00:42:23,150
they will always remain as a nurse and 
it,

834
00:42:23,210 --> 00:42:24,043
those who continue to do what they 
believed in and that what they believe 

835
00:42:28,101 --> 00:42:32,210
in is the right thing because they will 
not harm anyone.

836
00:42:32,510 --> 00:42:35,090
They were contributing to a very 
important,

837
00:42:35,540 --> 00:42:40,250
since things such as freedom of 
expression and they were contributing to

838
00:42:40,251 --> 00:42:44,780
this to keep and save the values of 
France as well,

839
00:42:44,781 --> 00:42:48,620
which is a liberty equality fraternity,
which is,

840
00:42:48,621 --> 00:42:50,910
you know,
sometimes today you think that it,

841
00:42:51,080 --> 00:42:54,110
it,
it remains only on the buildings written

842
00:42:54,111 --> 00:42:56,240
on the buildings,
but not actually in life,

843
00:42:56,241 --> 00:42:59,630
not actually applied and life of society
anymore.

844
00:42:59,630 --> 00:43:02,420
So Charlotte Heroes,
part of being friends,

845
00:43:02,450 --> 00:43:03,960
they are heroes.
Uh,

846
00:43:04,780 --> 00:43:05,613
however,
I should also mention that just the 

847
00:43:08,180 --> 00:43:10,310
months before they,
they were killed,

848
00:43:10,340 --> 00:43:12,590
they were racist,
Islamophobes,

849
00:43:12,940 --> 00:43:13,750
uh,
you know,

850
00:43:13,750 --> 00:43:14,583
they,
they will always named for being too 

851
00:43:16,671 --> 00:43:19,010
much for going too far,
for,

852
00:43:19,060 --> 00:43:20,930
for offending.
We all know that.

853
00:43:21,060 --> 00:43:22,980
Right?
And just to be very clear,

854
00:43:22,981 --> 00:43:25,320
I know this has been said a thousand 
times over,

855
00:43:25,350 --> 00:43:28,620
but they were not racist and they were 
not Islamophobia,

856
00:43:28,621 --> 00:43:30,870
which is a made up word by the way,
but they were not.

857
00:43:30,871 --> 00:43:31,704
They were pointing out the,
they made fun of everybody and I think 

858
00:43:34,621 --> 00:43:38,280
something like it's three percent of the
covers were about Islam,

859
00:43:38,281 --> 00:43:42,330
but they equally attacked Christianity 
and Judaism and all the religions.

860
00:43:42,331 --> 00:43:43,164
It was about power.
So they were making cartoons about the 

861
00:43:45,031 --> 00:43:48,660
exact things that you were protesting in
the streets.

862
00:43:48,661 --> 00:43:49,860
It was really kind of amazing.

863
00:43:51,180 --> 00:43:56,180
I mean,
I think what you mentioned just now that

864
00:43:57,331 --> 00:43:58,164
only three percent of the covers and 
they're all material in newspaper was 

865
00:44:01,711 --> 00:44:06,711
about Islam also shows something that we
were also discussing with them often and

866
00:44:08,190 --> 00:44:09,023
you know,
as we talk about France and things that 

867
00:44:10,650 --> 00:44:13,920
happened in France,
maybe to make sense to quote a voluntary

868
00:44:13,921 --> 00:44:15,550
gain here.
Um,

869
00:44:15,570 --> 00:44:19,260
and this words attribute it to him.
He said that if you want to find out who

870
00:44:19,261 --> 00:44:20,094
rules over you,
simply understand who you are not 

871
00:44:22,890 --> 00:44:26,040
allowed to criticize.
So even this three percent,

872
00:44:26,060 --> 00:44:26,980
you know,
of the,

873
00:44:27,080 --> 00:44:28,980
of the information or the,
the,

874
00:44:29,070 --> 00:44:29,910
the topic,
you know,

875
00:44:29,911 --> 00:44:33,530
I slept,
it was just taking three percent of the,

876
00:44:33,700 --> 00:44:38,130
of the whole information off Charlotte 
door really shows a lot.

877
00:44:38,131 --> 00:44:42,300
So that of course is the youngest from 
three minutes they stick religions,

878
00:44:42,330 --> 00:44:46,020
the most ambitious probably today,
the most demanding religion.

879
00:44:46,760 --> 00:44:50,580
It really reveals its face to face and 
reacts in a different way.

880
00:44:50,670 --> 00:44:51,503
Right.
So I know you've talked about the 

881
00:44:53,191 --> 00:44:54,024
regressive left and it started for me,
Charlie Hebdo was the beginning of my 

882
00:44:57,121 --> 00:45:00,210
awakening which happened over the course
of the next year or so.

883
00:45:00,410 --> 00:45:01,243
Um,
but what do you make of the group of 

884
00:45:02,851 --> 00:45:03,684
people and we had plenty of them here in
the United States and I'm sure you had 

885
00:45:06,211 --> 00:45:10,020
plenty of them in France as well.
People on the left,

886
00:45:10,080 --> 00:45:10,913
people that are for women's rights and 
for gay rights and for minority rights 

887
00:45:15,030 --> 00:45:17,880
that suddenly when it came to what 
happened with Charlie Hebdo at,

888
00:45:17,881 --> 00:45:19,200
ah,
you shouldn't have,

889
00:45:19,500 --> 00:45:20,333
you know,
you shouldn't have made fun of the 

890
00:45:21,511 --> 00:45:23,130
cartoons.
You shouldn't have done these cartoons.

891
00:45:23,131 --> 00:45:24,720
Talked about the profit,
whatever it is,

892
00:45:25,230 --> 00:45:28,920
people who otherwise are totally for 
free speech and free expression.

893
00:45:28,921 --> 00:45:31,240
Suddenly they're not in this case.
Uh,

894
00:45:31,330 --> 00:45:32,163
so what do you make of those people and 
how pervasive is that idea in France 

895
00:45:35,581 --> 00:45:36,414
these days?

896
00:45:36,930 --> 00:45:37,650
Well,
um,

897
00:45:37,650 --> 00:45:40,200
you said that it all started for you off
to Charlotte.

898
00:45:40,201 --> 00:45:41,034
Do I think that it became so visible in 
France as well after Charlotte recently 

899
00:45:46,291 --> 00:45:50,840
also after Cologne attacks in Germany,
uh,

900
00:45:50,970 --> 00:45:51,803
which we can also discuss not only 
lectures but also feminist reaction or 

901
00:45:55,921 --> 00:45:58,330
feminist non-reaction.
Uh,

902
00:45:58,740 --> 00:46:00,540
so I think that's a,
yeah,

903
00:46:00,541 --> 00:46:03,690
it's after these events we could see 
this,

904
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:04,833
you know,
fraction of leftists who would deny the 

905
00:46:08,221 --> 00:46:09,054
ins the essential problem,
who would be scared to talk about the 

906
00:46:13,651 --> 00:46:16,050
roots of the problem,
who will,

907
00:46:16,680 --> 00:46:17,513
who will be willing not to talk about 
Charlotte killers as people with guns 

908
00:46:23,970 --> 00:46:24,803
and not discuss their ideas and not 
discuss what they were screaming wild 

909
00:46:29,820 --> 00:46:33,310
shooting our friends,
what they were in,

910
00:46:33,390 --> 00:46:34,223
in the name of who they committed these 
atrocities and what made them could 

911
00:46:38,220 --> 00:46:40,680
believe.
And then they have to do that.

912
00:46:40,980 --> 00:46:42,010
So,
um,

913
00:46:42,450 --> 00:46:44,130
I think that this is something,
again,

914
00:46:44,131 --> 00:46:44,964
which of course brings Europe in a very 
big danger and especially the values of 

915
00:46:49,831 --> 00:46:51,840
Europe in a very big danger.

916
00:46:51,840 --> 00:46:55,230
And therefore,
I say that sometimes working in Paris,

917
00:46:55,231 --> 00:46:59,220
I read this three words that the slogan 
of French Revolution,

918
00:46:59,221 --> 00:47:03,620
and I understand that this is very far 
from reality today from the society,

919
00:47:03,621 --> 00:47:08,621
and of course you hear the leaders,
the leftest leaders here who tried to,

920
00:47:09,781 --> 00:47:10,614
you know,
make speeches to defend freedom of 

921
00:47:12,601 --> 00:47:16,440
expression and make of Charlotte door a 
heroes,

922
00:47:16,920 --> 00:47:18,470
um,
because they're,

923
00:47:18,510 --> 00:47:21,690
you know,
John List who fell down but they do not,

924
00:47:21,740 --> 00:47:25,680
will not want to discuss for which ideas
they,

925
00:47:25,710 --> 00:47:28,410
they found that for which ideas they 
were killed.

926
00:47:28,650 --> 00:47:30,730
So many of them,
you know,

927
00:47:30,731 --> 00:47:34,540
of course do it.
I'm out of fear,

928
00:47:35,260 --> 00:47:39,750
but very different theater.
There is a very big fear to be a,

929
00:47:39,890 --> 00:47:42,430
to have similar speech too,
right wing,

930
00:47:42,940 --> 00:47:43,773
similar speech to actually xenophobes 
and racists such as Japan here in 

931
00:47:52,241 --> 00:47:53,074
France,
therefore left is decided to take this 

932
00:47:55,571 --> 00:47:57,970
very ridiculous,
again,

933
00:47:57,971 --> 00:48:02,971
intellectually dishonest position such 
as denying their roots.

934
00:48:03,311 --> 00:48:05,300
And they did the real,
the,

935
00:48:05,330 --> 00:48:09,010
the central problem in the situation.
And I think this way,

936
00:48:09,011 --> 00:48:13,330
the betrayal.
So the ideas of Charlotte and of course,

937
00:48:13,700 --> 00:48:15,190
yes.
So at the end,

938
00:48:15,280 --> 00:48:19,810
the result is that it's only or extreme 
right wing,

939
00:48:20,020 --> 00:48:20,853
the racists,
the xenophobes who are speaking out 

940
00:48:23,620 --> 00:48:24,230
actually.

941
00:48:24,230 --> 00:48:25,010
Yeah.
And this is,

942
00:48:25,010 --> 00:48:29,060
this is what I've said repeatedly here,
is that we on the left have to deal with

943
00:48:29,061 --> 00:48:29,894
this because if we don't,
and this is exactly what your peace in 

944
00:48:32,961 --> 00:48:34,610
the international business times was 
about.

945
00:48:34,611 --> 00:48:35,600
If,
if the,

946
00:48:35,660 --> 00:48:38,120
if we don't deal with the regressive 
left,

947
00:48:38,330 --> 00:48:40,220
then who do we hand it to?
The racist,

948
00:48:40,221 --> 00:48:41,054
right?
That,

949
00:48:41,200 --> 00:48:42,430
that was your,
your term.

950
00:48:42,510 --> 00:48:43,343
And I couldn't agree more.
So when you say that France in terms of 

951
00:48:45,921 --> 00:48:49,610
free speech and uh,
people getting along,

952
00:48:49,640 --> 00:48:52,640
would you say Francis in a worse 
position now,

953
00:48:52,790 --> 00:48:56,210
do you think that there was a net loss 
in free speech after Charlie Hebdo?

954
00:48:56,211 --> 00:48:59,600
Because there were a couple weeks after 
where the whole world united and,

955
00:48:59,870 --> 00:49:00,703
and you know,
all those world leaders came to Paris 

956
00:49:02,091 --> 00:49:04,010
and it sounded like something good was 
going to happen.

957
00:49:04,250 --> 00:49:06,590
But I sent you think it's probably the 
reverse now.

958
00:49:07,350 --> 00:49:08,300
Well,
again,

959
00:49:08,301 --> 00:49:10,940
there are so many aspects to discuss 
here.

960
00:49:10,941 --> 00:49:15,941
This manifestation that happened after 
the 11th of January was ridiculous.

961
00:49:16,460 --> 00:49:17,051
And,
uh,

962
00:49:17,051 --> 00:49:17,601
the,
the,

963
00:49:17,601 --> 00:49:21,230
the cartoonists who survived a lose,
for example,

964
00:49:21,231 --> 00:49:23,510
who made the next cover,
uh,

965
00:49:23,610 --> 00:49:27,640
was Muhammad was prophet,
uh,

966
00:49:27,641 --> 00:49:31,620
I'm crying,
we were laughing with him again.

967
00:49:31,670 --> 00:49:32,880
Parity.
It's true.

968
00:49:33,780 --> 00:49:34,613
Rebel,
laughing because in front of him there 

969
00:49:37,431 --> 00:49:42,431
was a line of all the enemies of ideas 
of Charlotte and they will marching,

970
00:49:43,910 --> 00:49:45,080
you know,
again,

971
00:49:45,090 --> 00:49:50,090
if this event was so full of hypocrisy 
because fact they were marching at least

972
00:49:50,901 --> 00:49:52,550
this front line.
Well,

973
00:49:52,551 --> 00:49:53,900
marching,
not for the,

974
00:49:53,930 --> 00:49:56,450
not for the right ideas,
you know,

975
00:49:56,451 --> 00:49:58,970
they were pretending they were.
Yeah,

976
00:49:58,971 --> 00:50:00,590
it was,
it was fake.

977
00:50:01,210 --> 00:50:03,620
I'm not talking about the million of 
people,

978
00:50:05,030 --> 00:50:09,230
but I'm talking about this front line,
which was totally ridiculous.

979
00:50:09,231 --> 00:50:10,064
And what happened after there was so 
many events dedicated to discussion of 

980
00:50:16,071 --> 00:50:18,360
free speech,
which we were,

981
00:50:18,620 --> 00:50:22,360
which were cancelled by the government,
by police,

982
00:50:22,361 --> 00:50:23,600
uh,
in order to,

983
00:50:23,660 --> 00:50:24,421
you know,
for,

984
00:50:24,421 --> 00:50:27,380
for security reasons or events in which 
me,

985
00:50:27,390 --> 00:50:29,390
myself was supposed to participate.

986
00:50:29,600 --> 00:50:31,950
So many of them were canceled.
Again,

987
00:50:31,951 --> 00:50:32,784
the event that happened just one month,
often Copenhagen during which I was 

988
00:50:36,771 --> 00:50:40,370
speaking,
was interrupted by another terrorist.

989
00:50:40,371 --> 00:50:41,060
And,
uh,

990
00:50:41,060 --> 00:50:42,320
again,
uh,

991
00:50:42,321 --> 00:50:45,110
one person who had been killed and 
injured.

992
00:50:45,410 --> 00:50:47,500
So this way,
you know,

993
00:50:47,600 --> 00:50:50,030
again,
I think that we failed after Charlotte,

994
00:50:50,031 --> 00:50:54,290
do we failed with all this ridiculous 
thing such as inviting,

995
00:50:54,470 --> 00:50:55,303
actually the,
the representatives or those of those 

996
00:50:58,311 --> 00:51:00,970
who are feeding the terrorist,
um,

997
00:51:01,280 --> 00:51:02,113
those who feed the ideas that are well 
actually cannot go exist with ideas of 

998
00:51:08,670 --> 00:51:09,503
freedom of speech.
Inviting them to Paris to March for 

999
00:51:11,461 --> 00:51:16,310
ideas of Charlotte is something that 
already showed that we will fail in this

1000
00:51:16,311 --> 00:51:19,850
discussion.
And I don't want to make your conclusion

1001
00:51:19,851 --> 00:51:23,090
that we did fail,
but I feel we are failing.

1002
00:51:23,610 --> 00:51:26,070
I'm here in Europe.
The Europe is fading.

1003
00:51:26,100 --> 00:51:30,890
European society is failing because 
they're not ready to weld to face.

1004
00:51:31,040 --> 00:51:34,010
Very uncomfortable,
very unpleasant,

1005
00:51:34,011 --> 00:51:35,900
but truth,
they are not,

1006
00:51:36,220 --> 00:51:37,053
they are not able to hear.
Unpopular speech and freedom of speech 

1007
00:51:42,081 --> 00:51:45,290
is really about something.
If liberty is really something,

1008
00:51:45,410 --> 00:51:48,920
it's definitely about unpopular speech.
It's about hearing,

1009
00:51:49,190 --> 00:51:50,023
accepting this unpopular,
uncomfortable speech and to Europe is 

1010
00:51:53,271 --> 00:51:54,500
failing of doing that.

1011
00:51:54,650 --> 00:51:55,483
So we only have a couple of minutes left
and I know we're just getting into the 

1012
00:51:57,171 --> 00:51:58,004
meat of this,
so we're going to have to do this again 

1013
00:51:58,971 --> 00:52:01,430
where we can talk for much longer,
but uh,

1014
00:52:01,630 --> 00:52:02,463
I,
I hear you on the Europe part and 

1015
00:52:03,171 --> 00:52:04,004
that's,
I get so much email now from the same 

1016
00:52:06,410 --> 00:52:07,243
people saying the same things in Denmark
and in France and in Germany and 

1017
00:52:11,301 --> 00:52:12,620
Finland,
all of these countries,

1018
00:52:12,621 --> 00:52:13,454
people are saying the exact same things 
that you're talking about and they feel 

1019
00:52:15,711 --> 00:52:18,530
that there is no faith in the government
that the governments are going to do the

1020
00:52:18,531 --> 00:52:20,840
right things and all of that.
So,

1021
00:52:20,900 --> 00:52:21,980
uh,
so let's end on this.

1022
00:52:21,981 --> 00:52:26,630
So the Cologne event that,
that happened in Germany with this,

1023
00:52:26,720 --> 00:52:27,553
it sounds like a thousand men were 
running rampant throughout the city and 

1024
00:52:30,561 --> 00:52:33,290
it's unclear if they were all immigrants
or migrants or whatever it was.

1025
00:52:33,880 --> 00:52:37,830
The reaction to that must have been 
particularly upsetting to you because he

1026
00:52:37,831 --> 00:52:42,831
dealt with sort of the free speech stuff
and bringing all these people in.

1027
00:52:43,640 --> 00:52:46,250
But it also directly.
This was in a direct assault on women.

1028
00:52:46,490 --> 00:52:47,323
So it really went to everything that you
care about was the reaction to that 

1029
00:52:50,181 --> 00:52:53,060
because I saw a feminists that were not 
defending the women.

1030
00:52:53,240 --> 00:52:57,530
I suddenly saw a feminist online,
well known feminists that were saying,

1031
00:52:57,560 --> 00:52:58,393
oh,
this is just an excuse for the 

1032
00:52:59,241 --> 00:53:02,720
xenophobes and white men do it too.
And all of those things.

1033
00:53:03,010 --> 00:53:03,843
Uh,
so that was one must have been 

1034
00:53:04,371 --> 00:53:05,480
particularly upsetting,
right?

1035
00:53:06,140 --> 00:53:06,971
Well,
it was,

1036
00:53:06,971 --> 00:53:07,880
um,
yeah,

1037
00:53:07,881 --> 00:53:10,970
of course it was not only on,
not only upsetting,

1038
00:53:11,960 --> 00:53:12,900
you don't.
I think that's,

1039
00:53:12,960 --> 00:53:14,660
yeah.
Today we use,

1040
00:53:14,810 --> 00:53:15,643
you look around and you see the,
those who were supposed to be your 

1041
00:53:17,901 --> 00:53:18,734
allies,
those supports to share with you with a 

1042
00:53:21,211 --> 00:53:26,211
very fundamental values.
And Stanford them either keep silence or

1043
00:53:27,360 --> 00:53:30,840
try to support.
Actually you are aggressors.

1044
00:53:30,841 --> 00:53:34,710
The of women,
just because of the fact it was reported

1045
00:53:34,740 --> 00:53:35,573
that among the aggressors were men know 
who looked like Arabic man or north 

1046
00:53:40,650 --> 00:53:43,470
African region feminists,
silence.

1047
00:53:43,500 --> 00:53:46,200
They didn't want to discuss,
uh,

1048
00:53:46,230 --> 00:53:51,230
what actually happened just because of 
fear of again being,

1049
00:53:51,511 --> 00:53:52,344
you know,
having the speech of extreme right wing 

1050
00:53:54,240 --> 00:53:59,240
and at the end who appeared to be actual
defenders of a women,

1051
00:54:00,301 --> 00:54:01,134
you know,
who were raped an aggressive after 

1052
00:54:03,511 --> 00:54:05,130
prolonged what extreme,
right.

1053
00:54:05,131 --> 00:54:07,800
Wait again,
the platform was giving to them.

1054
00:54:08,070 --> 00:54:13,020
So I think that to those people who 
write you emails and to people who write

1055
00:54:13,021 --> 00:54:17,530
me as well a lot and put support who 
feel very feel betrayed,

1056
00:54:17,560 --> 00:54:19,320
the sad,
uh,

1057
00:54:19,321 --> 00:54:24,321
by the situation with that is going on 
today in Europe by leftist reactions,

1058
00:54:24,331 --> 00:54:27,600
by the reaction,
some of a reaction of the feminists.

1059
00:54:27,900 --> 00:54:32,900
I think we have to understand that to be
sad is not enough to be sad,

1060
00:54:33,301 --> 00:54:34,134
you know,
makes people cry and a stay at home and 

1061
00:54:37,020 --> 00:54:38,280
feel low,
you know,

1062
00:54:38,430 --> 00:54:40,800
alone.
But what we have to be,

1063
00:54:41,130 --> 00:54:44,160
many people don't like to face it,
but what we have to be today,

1064
00:54:44,161 --> 00:54:48,000
we have to be angry.
I think anger brings people to action.

1065
00:54:48,300 --> 00:54:51,300
Not Hate,
but anger.

1066
00:54:51,660 --> 00:54:52,493
Anger for defense,
for the fact that you ideas are 

1067
00:54:55,411 --> 00:54:56,244
attacked,
that something very essential for your 

1068
00:54:58,351 --> 00:55:02,970
life and joy of life which people have 
today here.

1069
00:55:02,971 --> 00:55:05,880
Opportunity to enjoy life today,
here in Europe,

1070
00:55:06,150 --> 00:55:09,270
you have to defend it and for that you 
have to feel anger.

1071
00:55:09,271 --> 00:55:11,030
Don't feel sad.
I feel angry.

1072
00:55:11,370 --> 00:55:12,203
Act and defend your ideas and don't let 
the extreme right wing ride your own 

1073
00:55:16,680 --> 00:55:17,513
history.
Let's write it with our own beautiful 

1074
00:55:19,620 --> 00:55:21,660
liberal ideas.
That's my message.

1075
00:55:21,910 --> 00:55:22,510
Well,
you know,

1076
00:55:22,510 --> 00:55:25,760
I don't even have to ask you a final 
question because you couldn't have ended

1077
00:55:25,761 --> 00:55:26,594
this any better.
You absolutely have an ally in me and 

1078
00:55:30,081 --> 00:55:30,914
I'm sure and much of my audience so 
everyone can find more of his 

1079
00:55:34,520 --> 00:55:35,353
work@InaDashShevchenko.com.
I thank you for joining me and we 

1080
00:55:38,901 --> 00:55:41,660
absolutely will do this again because I 
feel like we just,

1081
00:55:41,690 --> 00:55:44,240
we just touched the surface of all this,
so thank you.

1082
00:55:44,270 --> 00:55:45,350
Thank you.
I appreciate it.
