1
00:00:02,640 --> 00:00:05,940
For those of you keeping score at home 
last week was one for the Rubin report.

2
00:00:05,941 --> 00:00:09,990
Record books are week.
Started off by interviewing Senator John

3
00:00:09,990 --> 00:00:10,801
Mccain,
a war hero,

4
00:00:10,801 --> 00:00:12,840
one of the longest serving members of 
Congress,

5
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:16,110
and a Republican nominee for president 
of the United States,

6
00:00:16,380 --> 00:00:19,760
Senator Mccain and I had a frank 
discussion on this year's election,

7
00:00:19,770 --> 00:00:20,603
money and politics and foreign policy.
What struck me more than anything while 

8
00:00:24,001 --> 00:00:24,834
talking to the senator was whether you 
agree or disagree with his political 

9
00:00:27,811 --> 00:00:28,644
opinions.
It's clear that he's really trying to 

10
00:00:31,021 --> 00:00:35,520
bridge the ideological divide and do 
what he feels is right for the country.

11
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:37,980
The entire time I was talking to him,
I kept thinking,

12
00:00:37,981 --> 00:00:40,770
what a better candidate,
senator mccain would be,

13
00:00:40,771 --> 00:00:44,700
the any of the current contenders in the
gop rat race.

14
00:00:45,540 --> 00:00:47,610
Immediately after interviewing Senator 
Mccain,

15
00:00:47,611 --> 00:00:48,444
I had the chance to interview loopnet.
Loopnet is a 23 year old engineering 

16
00:00:51,991 --> 00:00:56,010
student and an atheist fighting for 
secular values in her homeland of Iraq.

17
00:00:56,250 --> 00:00:57,083
Simply by talking to me about secularism
from the confines of her clothes 

18
00:01:00,911 --> 00:01:01,744
society.
She instantly became braver than pretty 

19
00:01:04,051 --> 00:01:04,884
much every person that I know.
I'm honored that she chose me as the 

20
00:01:07,891 --> 00:01:11,460
first public person to talk to and I'll 
always be an ally for her,

21
00:01:11,461 --> 00:01:15,480
whether she's in Iraq or wherever.
Life takes her while I was in awe of her

22
00:01:15,481 --> 00:01:16,314
during the interview.
The most impactful part to me was when 

23
00:01:18,151 --> 00:01:20,700
we talked about some of the people that 
we both admire,

24
00:01:20,970 --> 00:01:23,100
including Sam Harris and Richard 
Dawkins.

25
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:27,240
This portion of our chat illuminated 
exactly what this show is about.

26
00:01:27,270 --> 00:01:31,710
Ideas the same ideas that Sam and 
Richard sparked in me.

27
00:01:31,711 --> 00:01:35,130
A 39 year old guy born in Brooklyn,
living in Los Angeles,

28
00:01:35,310 --> 00:01:39,240
also were sparked in Louisiana.
A 23 year old atheist in Iraq.

29
00:01:39,510 --> 00:01:43,080
This shows you the true power of ideas,
good or bad.

30
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:45,690
Ideas can transcend nationality,
race,

31
00:01:45,691 --> 00:01:46,524
or religion.

32
00:01:47,370 --> 00:01:51,240
My final interview last week was with 
the former leader of the English defense

33
00:01:51,241 --> 00:01:54,000
league and now outspoken anti 
immigration activist,

34
00:01:54,001 --> 00:01:54,834
Tommy Robinson.
As I mentioned at the top of the show 

35
00:01:56,551 --> 00:01:57,384
last week,
I was hesitant to even talk to Tommy 

36
00:01:59,460 --> 00:02:02,160
because people might call me a bigot or 
a racist.

37
00:02:02,460 --> 00:02:04,410
Not only my glad that we did the 
interview,

38
00:02:04,411 --> 00:02:06,750
but I'm really proud of your reaction to
it,

39
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:08,720
whether on Youtube,
twitter,

40
00:02:08,721 --> 00:02:11,280
or facebook.
You guys all kept the conversation going

41
00:02:11,281 --> 00:02:12,114
after Tommy and I put it down.
It was complete and total confirmation 

42
00:02:15,601 --> 00:02:16,434
of last week's direct message being 
afraid to talk and no longer be part of 

43
00:02:20,371 --> 00:02:23,970
the equation.
I have no doubt there is a real movement

44
00:02:23,971 --> 00:02:24,804
happening right now.
People are absolutely sick of being 

45
00:02:27,121 --> 00:02:27,954
divided.
Conversation is the key to bringing us 

46
00:02:29,821 --> 00:02:32,700
together,
and that's why in one week I talked to a

47
00:02:32,701 --> 00:02:35,070
man who was almost the leader of the 
free world,

48
00:02:35,250 --> 00:02:36,083
a woman who puts her life on the line to
say what she believes and another man 

49
00:02:39,301 --> 00:02:40,770
who is on a crusade of his own.

50
00:02:41,370 --> 00:02:45,000
It's totally irrelevant whether I agree 
with everything my guest say.

51
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:47,490
The important thing is to not be afraid 
to hear them.

52
00:02:47,940 --> 00:02:49,890
As the Internet brings us all closer 
together,

53
00:02:49,900 --> 00:02:53,400
we find ourselves connected with people 
in a way that we could've only dreamt of

54
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:56,130
a couple years ago.
Despite that connection,

55
00:02:56,131 --> 00:02:56,964
I still get messages from you or is 
explaining that sometimes you guys are 

56
00:02:59,471 --> 00:03:00,304
afraid to say certain things to your 
friends in real life or to post certain 

57
00:03:03,311 --> 00:03:04,144
articles on facebook for all to see if 
lube a 23 year old in Iraq isn't afraid 

58
00:03:09,641 --> 00:03:12,340
to speak up,
then you guys can't be either.

59
00:03:12,510 --> 00:03:15,550
There is no time for silence anymore.
Yeah,

60
00:03:15,580 --> 00:03:16,413
there are genuinely bad people in the 
world and sometimes talking to them 

61
00:03:19,091 --> 00:03:21,430
won't get you the results you want.
However,

62
00:03:21,431 --> 00:03:24,460
you have to be brave enough to have the 
conversation in the first place.

63
00:03:24,790 --> 00:03:25,623
Don't let louder.
Voices with worst intentions drown you 

64
00:03:27,461 --> 00:03:30,940
out.
All right.

65
00:03:30,941 --> 00:03:31,774
According to Wikipedia,
my guest this week is either the former 

66
00:03:34,571 --> 00:03:35,404
king of Mesopotamia or youtube,
or not afraid to speak his mind on 

67
00:03:38,711 --> 00:03:40,900
controversial topics.
That's right.

68
00:03:40,901 --> 00:03:41,734
I have Carl Benjamin,
better known as Sargon of a cod on the 

69
00:03:44,651 --> 00:03:46,690
show.
Carl Sargon.

70
00:03:46,810 --> 00:03:47,643
What do I call you?

71
00:03:48,110 --> 00:03:51,140
Whichever you once.
I get cold both all day long.

72
00:03:51,141 --> 00:03:52,640
So whichever one you're comfortable 
with.

73
00:03:53,060 --> 00:03:56,000
Sargon has sort of overtaken.
Carl.

74
00:03:56,001 --> 00:03:58,850
There's sort of a Batman,
Bruce Wayne situation here.

75
00:03:58,851 --> 00:03:59,684
Right?

76
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:01,530
You know,
like that kind of is actually.

77
00:04:01,531 --> 00:04:02,364
Yeah,
it's the name song on his definitely 

78
00:04:05,130 --> 00:04:08,790
traveled before me in many places where 
progressives,

79
00:04:08,940 --> 00:04:10,350
a tense congregates

80
00:04:11,740 --> 00:04:15,100
aggressives I'm shocked that you didn't 
say regressives,

81
00:04:15,580 --> 00:04:19,630
but we'll get to that momentarily.
So,

82
00:04:19,631 --> 00:04:20,464
uh,
before we get into all the deep stuff 

83
00:04:22,061 --> 00:04:23,800
and the,
and the topics and the meat of this,

84
00:04:23,801 --> 00:04:24,634
I want people to get to know you a 
little bit because I think it's sort of 

85
00:04:27,431 --> 00:04:30,370
just recently that you're showing your 
face more.

86
00:04:30,371 --> 00:04:31,204
You're out there more,
your name's getting out there a little 

87
00:04:33,191 --> 00:04:37,300
bit more.
So how did Carl Benjamin Becomes Argon?

88
00:04:37,301 --> 00:04:38,134
Have a guide.

89
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:39,193
Um.
Oh,

90
00:04:39,230 --> 00:04:41,430
that's an interesting.
It's an interesting story.

91
00:04:41,590 --> 00:04:42,780
It's not actually that interesting as 
well.

92
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:46,330
That will just make it interesting.
How about that?

93
00:04:46,450 --> 00:04:48,530
I'll try,
I'll try and I'll try and fabricates let

94
00:04:48,540 --> 00:04:50,720
me know.
Basically about.

95
00:04:50,730 --> 00:04:54,270
So about two and a half years ago.
I know you when you know,

96
00:04:54,271 --> 00:04:57,180
when you're on the Internet,
you ended up just choosing a Monica that

97
00:04:57,181 --> 00:04:58,014
you sign into places with and I just 
happened to like the historical figure 

98
00:05:01,381 --> 00:05:03,240
of song and he was an interesting 
figure.

99
00:05:03,510 --> 00:05:05,080
I like the sound of the name and you 
know,

100
00:05:05,180 --> 00:05:06,013
I saw,
I was just using that and I had signed 

101
00:05:07,921 --> 00:05:08,754
up to youtube.
I'm in 2010 just to upload some videos 

102
00:05:12,031 --> 00:05:13,980
of myself with an ancient sling,
you know,

103
00:05:13,981 --> 00:05:14,814
the sort of,
uh,

104
00:05:15,260 --> 00:05:16,093
I made one call the historical sort of 
documents and I tested it out and it's 

105
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:23,210
that you can see why they're dangerous 
weapons or thing.

106
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:27,240
And then a few days later I was 
basically getting really,

107
00:05:27,241 --> 00:05:28,074
really worried about lead the sort of 
political climate in the left eye was 

108
00:05:31,620 --> 00:05:35,130
starting to see more and more often I'm 
just my,

109
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:37,070
my own principles being completely 
violated.

110
00:05:37,140 --> 00:05:38,760
And it was really,
really,

111
00:05:38,761 --> 00:05:42,150
really worried and it was thing that was
genuinely started ignoring me because,

112
00:05:42,570 --> 00:05:43,403
I mean I would see people arguing for 
arguing against people's freedom of 

113
00:05:46,411 --> 00:05:50,850
speech or they would be arguing against 
the socratic system.

114
00:05:50,970 --> 00:05:54,500
So some Lama and everyone would seem to 
be going along with it this,

115
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:55,910
this was it,
you know,

116
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:56,910
there was so many people going,
yeah,

117
00:05:56,930 --> 00:05:58,420
that's exactly how we should do things.
Those,

118
00:05:58,421 --> 00:05:59,254
those Palak thinking course.
I totally disagree and I disagree on 

119
00:06:02,661 --> 00:06:03,494
such a fundamental level.
I have to say something and so I found 

120
00:06:06,351 --> 00:06:07,184
myself just motivated sort of right 
around just like under five minute 

121
00:06:10,561 --> 00:06:13,160
scripts or something and then read them 
with a very,

122
00:06:13,161 --> 00:06:16,940
very bad microphone.
It's all about the mic.

123
00:06:17,420 --> 00:06:18,550
It really is.
It's,

124
00:06:18,551 --> 00:06:21,020
it's a,
it's a magician's trick on this,

125
00:06:21,270 --> 00:06:23,060
but I have just the cheap on microphone.
It was really,

126
00:06:23,061 --> 00:06:27,620
really terrible quality and I'd read 
these ideas and they started gaining.

127
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:29,750
Some teams have started.
People started subscribing to my channel

128
00:06:29,751 --> 00:06:31,580
and stuff and looking back,
now I'm thinking,

129
00:06:31,581 --> 00:06:32,391
God,
they were really.

130
00:06:32,391 --> 00:06:33,224
That was a little full bearings there 
about my technical skill and what I was 

131
00:06:35,871 --> 00:06:38,240
saying,
but I guess some people agreed with what

132
00:06:38,241 --> 00:06:39,074
was saying because now I've got um,
I've just lost a quarter of a million 

133
00:06:41,211 --> 00:06:43,100
subscribers.
Uh,

134
00:06:43,130 --> 00:06:45,610
yeah.
Now I do this full time and it's a,

135
00:06:45,710 --> 00:06:49,740
it's a wonderful thing to be doing is 
fighting for my principals professional.

136
00:06:49,930 --> 00:06:53,110
So I love that.
I love that because as I say on the show

137
00:06:53,111 --> 00:06:53,944
every week,
what I'm trying to do here is make this 

138
00:06:55,301 --> 00:06:56,134
about ideas.
And that's really what you were talking 

139
00:06:58,421 --> 00:06:59,254
about,
you were hearing bad ideas and then you 

140
00:07:01,301 --> 00:07:05,140
want it to beat them with better ideas 
and clearly it's working because you got

141
00:07:05,141 --> 00:07:07,150
over 250,000
subscribers.

142
00:07:07,370 --> 00:07:08,203
And,
and when I had my personal awakening 

143
00:07:10,751 --> 00:07:12,880
because everyone knows at this point,
you know,

144
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:17,020
I've always considered myself liberal.
Then I was in the progressive world,

145
00:07:17,021 --> 00:07:19,150
which I now see as some sort of mental 
disorder.

146
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:20,233
Um,
but when I was having my awakening out 

147
00:07:22,211 --> 00:07:23,680
of that,
uh,

148
00:07:23,770 --> 00:07:28,630
everyone online said to me,
you've got to talk to Sargon.

149
00:07:29,090 --> 00:07:29,980
Uh,
so my,

150
00:07:30,010 --> 00:07:33,400
so my first question to you before we 
get into the heavy stuff is,

151
00:07:33,401 --> 00:07:34,234
did you study politics?
What brought you into the political 

152
00:07:36,671 --> 00:07:37,504
realm?

153
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:38,530
I didn't.
It was,

154
00:07:38,531 --> 00:07:40,750
um,
it was just watching the news I guess,

155
00:07:40,751 --> 00:07:42,310
and just watching you know,
popular.

156
00:07:42,580 --> 00:07:42,981
I mean,
I,

157
00:07:42,981 --> 00:07:43,814
I used to be,
I used to be a big fan of the young 

158
00:07:44,621 --> 00:07:45,910
Turks.
Um,

159
00:07:45,911 --> 00:07:49,990
I used to consider myself progressive 
until I met progressive's.

160
00:07:50,050 --> 00:07:50,883
And like you said,
I couldn't believe the things they were 

161
00:07:52,451 --> 00:07:53,284
saying it,
it really struck me as some sort of 

162
00:07:54,731 --> 00:07:55,790
mental disorder.
Yeah.

163
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:58,570
Why would they start saying things like 
this and.

164
00:07:58,870 --> 00:07:59,471
Yeah,
and then I,

165
00:07:59,471 --> 00:08:00,280
then I,
I,

166
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:01,113
I,
I still find myself floundering on my 

167
00:08:02,681 --> 00:08:04,030
own because the,
you know,

168
00:08:04,060 --> 00:08:04,760
there's,
I,

169
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:05,593
I'm not a conservative and I can't,
I can't bring myself to subscribe to 

170
00:08:08,351 --> 00:08:10,010
conservative ideals and they just 
didn't.

171
00:08:10,260 --> 00:08:11,230
They didn't work for me.
I don't,

172
00:08:11,770 --> 00:08:13,060
I don't believe in them.
Um,

173
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:16,370
and so I was basically on my own,
you know,

174
00:08:16,390 --> 00:08:18,330
everyone I knew was,
it was a liberal,

175
00:08:18,580 --> 00:08:22,930
was quite happy to ignore the 
foundational principles of liberalism in

176
00:08:22,931 --> 00:08:26,710
order to,
in order to push progressivism,

177
00:08:26,870 --> 00:08:28,060
furthering.
The more I,

178
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:29,680
the more I've learned about 
progressivism,

179
00:08:29,681 --> 00:08:30,514
the more I realize it's really used 
liberalism as a Trojan horse to they've 

180
00:08:35,260 --> 00:08:35,531
said,
oh,

181
00:08:35,531 --> 00:08:38,200
we liberals or progressives and I mean 
on the,

182
00:08:38,380 --> 00:08:39,213
on the subsequent.
They're not necessarily our group for 

183
00:08:40,460 --> 00:08:42,940
different things.
It's really the methods,

184
00:08:42,941 --> 00:08:45,490
the problem.
It's not necessarily the goals.

185
00:08:45,810 --> 00:08:47,050
Um,
but yeah,

186
00:08:47,051 --> 00:08:47,491
they,
they,

187
00:08:47,491 --> 00:08:48,324
they heavily use the terms 
interchangeably and they are not 

188
00:08:50,651 --> 00:08:51,730
interchangeable.
That's all.

189
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:52,770
Yeah.
So let's,

190
00:08:52,770 --> 00:08:53,603
let's unpack that a little bit.
So I've heard you say you refer to 

191
00:08:55,711 --> 00:09:00,120
yourself as a classic liberal,
and the more that I've been doing this,

192
00:09:00,121 --> 00:09:02,160
I mean that's really where I feel at 
home too.

193
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:05,790
I think now I have some really strong 
libertarian leanings also,

194
00:09:05,791 --> 00:09:06,660
but there's,
there's some,

195
00:09:06,690 --> 00:09:09,720
there's some play there,
there's some common ground there.

196
00:09:09,900 --> 00:09:12,090
But what is classic liberalism mean to 
you?

197
00:09:13,030 --> 00:09:15,370
Um,
well it's just the instance,

198
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:18,440
the basic values that came out of the 
alignment,

199
00:09:18,740 --> 00:09:20,690
the civil liberties,
political freedom,

200
00:09:20,691 --> 00:09:22,370
freedom of expression,
freedom of association,

201
00:09:22,610 --> 00:09:24,290
Economic Freedom,
representative democracy,

202
00:09:24,291 --> 00:09:26,330
the rule of law.
It's always just,

203
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:28,880
there is no argument against these 
ideas.

204
00:09:28,881 --> 00:09:31,220
These are great ideas that universal 
ideas,

205
00:09:31,430 --> 00:09:33,980
you know,
everyone is protected under these ideas.

206
00:09:33,981 --> 00:09:34,814
Unlike with progressivism web,
the first thing they will do is 

207
00:09:37,971 --> 00:09:40,520
demarcates a group and they will say,
right women,

208
00:09:40,790 --> 00:09:42,020
black people,
gay people,

209
00:09:42,260 --> 00:09:43,093
these people need special treatment and 
special treatment will involve the 

210
00:09:45,981 --> 00:09:46,814
infringement of your personal rights.
And that is where I have a problem 

211
00:09:49,971 --> 00:09:52,790
because if we all ascribe to these same 
rights,

212
00:09:52,820 --> 00:09:55,370
hey,
we're all being treated as equals B,

213
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:58,950
nobody ends up losing their rights.
And I don't have a point seat.

214
00:09:59,180 --> 00:10:02,110
Should I do?
I think I've covered the reasons.

215
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:02,640
Yeah,
that,

216
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:04,670
that was pretty good.
So this is sort of a,

217
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:07,910
an example of the road to hell is paved 
with good intentions,

218
00:10:07,911 --> 00:10:10,040
right?
Because this is where I've seen,

219
00:10:10,041 --> 00:10:13,870
I know a lot of progressives,
a lot of them won't talk to me anymore.

220
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:16,310
People that I that were my good friends 
only,

221
00:10:16,311 --> 00:10:16,851
you know,
six,

222
00:10:16,851 --> 00:10:18,620
eight months ago that won't talk to me 
anymore.

223
00:10:18,830 --> 00:10:19,663
But I believe that for the most part,
and we're going to get into some of the 

224
00:10:22,161 --> 00:10:24,260
really dangerous ones.
But I think for the most part,

225
00:10:24,470 --> 00:10:26,330
people that consider themselves 
progressive,

226
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:27,193
most of the people that are going to 
Bernie Sanders rallies I think are good 

227
00:10:29,511 --> 00:10:31,550
people.
I think their intentions are correct.

228
00:10:31,910 --> 00:10:34,280
So we're really talking about the 
methodology here,

229
00:10:34,281 --> 00:10:35,114
right?

230
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:35,950
Yeah.
The,

231
00:10:35,950 --> 00:10:37,190
the,
there are a few.

232
00:10:38,250 --> 00:10:39,083
The problem is you have a bunch of.
You have a bunch of motivating factors 

233
00:10:43,351 --> 00:10:46,800
that kind of coalesce and in mixed in 
with that,

234
00:10:46,801 --> 00:10:51,801
you have the more sort of a punisher 
aspects of people who can see where this

235
00:10:53,761 --> 00:10:54,594
is going because a lot of it involves 
giving the benefit of the doubts so 

236
00:10:57,901 --> 00:11:01,680
people who you would otherwise 
necessarily be skeptical to.

237
00:11:02,070 --> 00:11:03,170
People making.
I mean,

238
00:11:03,230 --> 00:11:04,270
for example,
rape laws,

239
00:11:04,710 --> 00:11:07,680
one of the big progressive pushes and it
is,

240
00:11:07,730 --> 00:11:11,040
is to have it so the victim quotes 
unquotes,

241
00:11:11,370 --> 00:11:12,203
the alleged victim is believed and 
therefore the burden of proof becomes 

242
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:17,433
lead on the person who's being accused 
rather than on the accuser and they do 

243
00:11:20,881 --> 00:11:22,440
this by the use of statistics.
They say,

244
00:11:22,620 --> 00:11:23,041
oh,
well,

245
00:11:23,041 --> 00:11:24,690
you know,
I can't remember the numbers,

246
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:25,553
but something like under five percent of
accused rapist go to jail or something 

247
00:11:28,651 --> 00:11:29,484
like that,
and therefore they assume that there is 

248
00:11:30,871 --> 00:11:32,310
a massive problem with the system.

249
00:11:32,580 --> 00:11:33,413
That 95 percent of accused rapist also 
actual rapists and therefore just being 

250
00:11:37,801 --> 00:11:40,800
let off through a bad system.
But the thing is,

251
00:11:40,810 --> 00:11:41,643
hey,
we don't know.

252
00:11:41,730 --> 00:11:42,563
We have no idea how many of the people 
who are accused are actually legitimate 

253
00:11:45,571 --> 00:11:49,300
rapists and deserve to be condemned for 
it and convicted for,

254
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:50,753
but secondly,
what we're doing that is reversing the 

255
00:11:52,411 --> 00:11:53,244
system because at the moment what we 
have as a system that isn't perfect but 

256
00:11:55,660 --> 00:11:58,400
can deliver justice in a reliable way,
you know,

257
00:11:58,680 --> 00:11:59,513
we,
we can be quite sure that the people 

258
00:12:00,461 --> 00:12:02,710
going to jail,
probably aunt innocent,

259
00:12:02,740 --> 00:12:03,573
you know,
we've been through a rigorous rigorous 

260
00:12:04,931 --> 00:12:07,210
trial.
The burden of proof is on the accuser.

261
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:08,073
They've managed to prove beyond 
reasonable doubt and you know that's 

262
00:12:10,661 --> 00:12:11,494
fine because that way you're going to 
get the minimum number of people who 

263
00:12:14,261 --> 00:12:15,094
didn't do anything wrong,
being punished as if they did something 

264
00:12:16,931 --> 00:12:17,440
wrong.

265
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:18,273
Whereas to flip the script on,
that would mean that you now have a 

266
00:12:21,011 --> 00:12:25,210
system that is inherently unjust,
that might be able to deliver justice on

267
00:12:25,211 --> 00:12:26,044
occasion.
The occasion being the person being 

268
00:12:28,031 --> 00:12:28,864
accused is on camera somewhere else at 
the time that they're supposed to have 

269
00:12:31,511 --> 00:12:32,950
been doing the rape or something like 
that.

270
00:12:32,951 --> 00:12:35,200
You know,
it's not sort of thing.

271
00:12:35,230 --> 00:12:37,840
It's,
it would be incidental justice.

272
00:12:38,060 --> 00:12:38,893
You know,
you couldn't rely on it because you 

273
00:12:40,061 --> 00:12:43,630
don't presume the innocence of the 
people being accused that guilt is being

274
00:12:43,631 --> 00:12:45,700
presumed and it's being done like say,
Oh,

275
00:12:45,701 --> 00:12:46,720
good motives.
The idea that,

276
00:12:46,940 --> 00:12:47,320
you know,
well,

277
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:49,300
we don't want to cool the victims lies 
and it's like,

278
00:12:49,301 --> 00:12:50,134
no,
I don't want to call the victim a liar 

279
00:12:50,831 --> 00:12:51,664
either,
but it's one of those points where 

280
00:12:52,931 --> 00:12:57,010
you're on the horns of a dilemma and you
have no choice but to take a responsible

281
00:12:57,011 --> 00:13:00,430
course of action for safety of someone 
who hasn't done anything wrong.

282
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:01,690
Right.
So,

283
00:13:01,691 --> 00:13:02,470
all right,
so there,

284
00:13:02,470 --> 00:13:07,470
there's a lot there that I want to go.
I've been preparing for this.

285
00:13:07,630 --> 00:13:08,080
Yeah,
yeah,

286
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:08,411
yeah.
No,

287
00:13:08,411 --> 00:13:09,244
you're jumping.
You're though I knew that that's how 

288
00:13:10,121 --> 00:13:12,760
this conversation was going to go 
because there's so much to talk about.

289
00:13:12,910 --> 00:13:15,670
And then these things are always 
inextricably linked.

290
00:13:15,700 --> 00:13:16,533
That's what I found whenever I'm talking
about anything related to sort of 

291
00:13:19,781 --> 00:13:20,614
regressive ideology.
And then when you start talking about 

292
00:13:22,661 --> 00:13:24,850
feminism and Islam,
Islam and all these things,

293
00:13:24,980 --> 00:13:25,560
uh,
they're,

294
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:28,420
they're all so inextricable,
inextricably linked.

295
00:13:28,700 --> 00:13:30,910
Um,
so let's,

296
00:13:30,911 --> 00:13:31,744
let's jump into Gamergate for a second 
and then we'll get back to some of that 

297
00:13:34,421 --> 00:13:37,630
stuff because Gamergate,
I think is one of the things that really

298
00:13:37,631 --> 00:13:42,180
sort of put you on the map.
And even by saying the word Gamergate,

299
00:13:42,340 --> 00:13:44,620
I've made people crazy.
We know this now.

300
00:13:44,621 --> 00:13:47,350
I've discussed it with a couple people 
I've had Milo Yiannopoulos on.

301
00:13:47,620 --> 00:13:49,750
I've talked about it with Christina Hoff
summers.

302
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:50,980
But you,
yourself,

303
00:13:51,010 --> 00:13:52,540
you are a true Gamer,
correct?

304
00:13:53,050 --> 00:13:54,850
Yes,
I am indeed a true Gamer.

305
00:13:55,020 --> 00:13:56,290
What are you playing these days?

306
00:13:56,730 --> 00:13:58,920
I play a game called oxygen level of 
volt.

307
00:13:58,960 --> 00:14:00,040
Most,
um,

308
00:14:00,220 --> 00:14:01,053
I actually have my own server where I 
pay for a sub or I get to run around 

309
00:14:03,381 --> 00:14:05,480
killing the tool dinosaurs.
That's great.

310
00:14:05,700 --> 00:14:06,533
Wow.
Well thank you for taking a moment from 

311
00:14:08,161 --> 00:14:10,440
slaying dinosaurs to uh,
to join me here.

312
00:14:10,690 --> 00:14:11,640
Uh,
but yeah,

313
00:14:11,641 --> 00:14:14,730
you've really been in the Gamergate 
thing and I think are considered sort of

314
00:14:14,731 --> 00:14:16,890
an expert on it.
So can you give me like a two,

315
00:14:16,891 --> 00:14:20,160
three minute explanation of what 
Gamergate is?

316
00:14:20,161 --> 00:14:20,994
And I know that's almost impossible 
because it seems like it's something 

317
00:14:23,281 --> 00:14:25,920
different to everybody.
It is,

318
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:28,500
is it,
I can give you my version of what it is,

319
00:14:28,501 --> 00:14:30,300
but like you say,
it is different for everybody and you're

320
00:14:30,301 --> 00:14:32,800
going to get people who are going to say
that's not what Gamergate,

321
00:14:32,850 --> 00:14:33,930
his and one not.
So,

322
00:14:34,140 --> 00:14:36,930
um,
for me it is,

323
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:38,273
it's a very definite reaction to 
regressives infiltrating the video game 

324
00:14:42,541 --> 00:14:45,540
media.
Now this is something that we saw.

325
00:14:45,670 --> 00:14:50,210
We've still happening over the course of
about five years where they were just in

326
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:51,073
criminal,
larger and larger numbers of them would 

327
00:14:53,151 --> 00:14:53,984
be hired at various gaming publications 
and then they would start writing 

328
00:14:57,111 --> 00:14:59,660
articles like all these video games,
sexist.

329
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:03,200
Why are these video games was soldiers.
There are no Trans People Nisa d games.

330
00:15:03,201 --> 00:15:04,430
This is racist.
This is,

331
00:15:04,770 --> 00:15:05,380
you know,
the,

332
00:15:05,380 --> 00:15:09,170
the standard regressive lines.
Yeah.

333
00:15:09,171 --> 00:15:10,004
And they would be promoting very famous 
feminist like Anita Sarkeesian or when 

334
00:15:13,550 --> 00:15:14,920
people with.
And I don't,

335
00:15:15,050 --> 00:15:16,430
I don't know,
I don't want to sound mean,

336
00:15:16,431 --> 00:15:21,420
but very few real credentials in the 
video game industry mean like Zoe Quinn.

337
00:15:21,430 --> 00:15:22,730
When the,
the,

338
00:15:22,731 --> 00:15:24,900
uh,
Franz Ferdinand of game of gates,

339
00:15:25,310 --> 00:15:26,610
uh,
she made a,

340
00:15:26,670 --> 00:15:27,980
a free.
Um,

341
00:15:28,490 --> 00:15:29,323
did you,
did you ever have those choose your own 

342
00:15:30,651 --> 00:15:31,380
adventure book?

343
00:15:31,380 --> 00:15:32,700
I loved,
choose your own adventure.

344
00:15:32,701 --> 00:15:34,360
I probably had everyone likes,
right?

345
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:35,273
Yeah.

346
00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:37,320
Yeah.
Basically that's what she had made.

347
00:15:37,321 --> 00:15:39,360
She had made a digital tutors rent 
adventure book.

348
00:15:39,361 --> 00:15:41,400
It was all old tanks.
No,

349
00:15:41,490 --> 00:15:43,740
no,
nothing else in it.

350
00:15:44,130 --> 00:15:44,963
It can take him very long,
but it was about learning to deal with 

351
00:15:46,621 --> 00:15:47,454
depression and I've never had depression
and so I can't judge the game on that 

352
00:15:50,281 --> 00:15:51,280
metric.
So I'm on that.

353
00:15:51,290 --> 00:15:52,123
I'm sure it's very good.
But your average game of this wasn't 

354
00:15:54,121 --> 00:15:55,740
really a game.
It wasn't a fail state,

355
00:15:55,830 --> 00:15:56,663
you know,
it wasn't,

356
00:15:56,840 --> 00:15:59,430
there wasn't really into complaint.
It was more like an interactive Nova,

357
00:15:59,431 --> 00:16:01,140
which is again,
it's in itself is fine,

358
00:16:01,740 --> 00:16:05,490
but the gaming press,
because she was a prominent feminist and

359
00:16:05,491 --> 00:16:09,240
regressive,
she got unbelievable amounts of coverage

360
00:16:09,410 --> 00:16:12,400
and I mean when I say unbelievable me,
any amounts of coverage,

361
00:16:12,410 --> 00:16:13,243
but it's more than you would expect.
And so people were kind of getting sick 

362
00:16:17,161 --> 00:16:18,480
of the agenda being pushed on them.

363
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:21,360
And it's the same as it needs to appease
him when he'd suck easy in.

364
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:23,520
Did a kickstarter,
it was everywhere.

365
00:16:23,580 --> 00:16:24,413
Everyone knew about it,
and yet everyone also knew that the 

366
00:16:27,151 --> 00:16:31,110
argument that she was presenting where 
half truths they would cherry pick,

367
00:16:31,140 --> 00:16:31,973
they were.
She was finding individually examples 

368
00:16:33,451 --> 00:16:35,970
that didn't really represent the gaming 
industry or any evil,

369
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:37,980
you know,
subsections of the gaming industry.

370
00:16:38,190 --> 00:16:39,023
I'm presenting them as if they were a 
categoric statement on the condition of 

371
00:16:42,151 --> 00:16:42,984
the entire gaming industry.
And so everyone was really kind of 

372
00:16:44,881 --> 00:16:45,714
annoyed by this point,
especially as the way that these people 

373
00:16:48,391 --> 00:16:49,224
work is by running a pure emotions.
So almost everything they say is 

374
00:16:52,110 --> 00:16:55,680
fundamentally accusatory.
They would say things like,

375
00:16:55,710 --> 00:16:57,960
you're a sexist or a racist if you like 
these games.

376
00:16:58,170 --> 00:17:00,270
There aren't enough black people in this
game,

377
00:17:00,271 --> 00:17:02,520
rotten of women in this game or gay 
people or the sort of thing.

378
00:17:02,820 --> 00:17:05,460
And if you're enjoying it,
you're a bad person.

379
00:17:06,090 --> 00:17:07,830
Whereas most people are thinking,
well,

380
00:17:07,831 --> 00:17:08,664
just how.
Just just make the games you want to 

381
00:17:09,571 --> 00:17:10,404
make.
Right?

382
00:17:10,770 --> 00:17:11,603
But no,
that's not what these people are 

383
00:17:12,601 --> 00:17:13,434
interested in whatsoever.
And so it got to the point where that 

384
00:17:16,650 --> 00:17:17,483
Zoe Quinn was colts having an affair 
with her boss who was involved in video 

385
00:17:22,711 --> 00:17:25,590
games and also a journalist called 
Nathan Grayson.

386
00:17:25,591 --> 00:17:29,400
And the video game industries presses 
always been corrupt.

387
00:17:29,770 --> 00:17:32,490
I mean that it's always been cropped.
It's come out of a hobby press.

388
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:35,070
It's always been really,
really bad.

389
00:17:35,460 --> 00:17:36,570
Um,
but

390
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:38,780
so when you say corrupt,
just to pause for one second,

391
00:17:38,781 --> 00:17:40,440
when you say corrupt,
I mean things like,

392
00:17:40,441 --> 00:17:41,274
you know,
people paying off the magazine writers 

393
00:17:43,380 --> 00:17:45,210
so that they'd get better reviews on the
game.

394
00:17:45,211 --> 00:17:46,650
So they'd sell more games.
I mean,

395
00:17:46,651 --> 00:17:47,910
real corrupt stuff.
Yeah.

396
00:17:48,110 --> 00:17:50,090
Yeah.
And a hold of it's in your face as well.

397
00:17:50,090 --> 00:17:52,530
So you go to a video game,
a online magazine,

398
00:17:52,770 --> 00:17:53,603
I'm the backdrop would be the 
advertisement for gate then would be 

399
00:17:56,581 --> 00:17:58,140
reviewed in the sense of color.
You know,

400
00:17:59,020 --> 00:18:01,470
it's not,
it's not even trying to hide it,

401
00:18:01,471 --> 00:18:05,130
but for the most part nobody really 
cared because they weren't being preachy

402
00:18:05,131 --> 00:18:05,581
about,
you know,

403
00:18:05,581 --> 00:18:06,930
they were trying to sell you video 
games.

404
00:18:07,170 --> 00:18:07,561
I'm asked,
well,

405
00:18:07,561 --> 00:18:09,990
people with death and that full of 
nobody was that bothered.

406
00:18:11,020 --> 00:18:11,853
But then the regressives turned up and 
started being corrupt in a whole 

407
00:18:14,341 --> 00:18:17,700
different way instead of instead of 
being motivated by money,

408
00:18:17,701 --> 00:18:18,534
which I suppose is to their credit,
they were motivated by ideology and so 

409
00:18:21,331 --> 00:18:22,164
now they would hire people into 
positions and promote things that were 

410
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:26,753
all based on cronyism.
It was all their friends and family 

411
00:18:29,011 --> 00:18:30,390
members and no,
they would.

412
00:18:30,450 --> 00:18:34,320
They would push everything to do with 
our agenda and people realistically,

413
00:18:34,350 --> 00:18:35,580
people have just been really,
really sick.

414
00:18:35,580 --> 00:18:37,320
Then just when they were tied to this 
phone,

415
00:18:37,321 --> 00:18:40,440
moralism tied to being told that they 
were bad people even though you didn't.

416
00:18:40,750 --> 00:18:42,990
Obviously none of these people are 
actually bad people,

417
00:18:42,991 --> 00:18:43,824
you know,
nobody knows who all these people and 

418
00:18:45,301 --> 00:18:46,050
yeah,
they're being,

419
00:18:46,050 --> 00:18:48,030
they're being prejudged before anything 
happens.

420
00:18:48,390 --> 00:18:50,310
And they got to the point where people 
like looking at it enough,

421
00:18:50,370 --> 00:18:51,480
you know,
this has got to stop.

422
00:18:51,540 --> 00:18:52,373
And that's what that was.
Basically it was called the Quinn 

423
00:18:56,051 --> 00:18:59,640
spirasi solid.
And then the video game press instead of

424
00:18:59,641 --> 00:19:01,380
turning around and saying something 
like,

425
00:19:01,710 --> 00:19:02,401
okay,
fair enough.

426
00:19:02,401 --> 00:19:04,470
We haven't been doing our due diligence.
You know,

427
00:19:04,510 --> 00:19:05,343
we,
a lot of them are professional trained 

428
00:19:06,481 --> 00:19:08,620
journalists like Steven that's a 
telephone Kentucky,

429
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:11,700
his master's degree in journalism and 
he's there saying,

430
00:19:11,701 --> 00:19:13,080
well,
do we have to be objective?

431
00:19:13,081 --> 00:19:15,120
What's the need for objective 
journalism?

432
00:19:15,121 --> 00:19:18,540
And so you can instantly see the 
problems that were in the air and in the

433
00:19:18,541 --> 00:19:19,374
video game industry.

434
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:20,720
Yeah.
And I know we can,

435
00:19:20,750 --> 00:19:23,130
we can really go down the rabbit hole 
with this and we could,

436
00:19:23,250 --> 00:19:26,030
we could spend three hours with this,
but I think that's.

437
00:19:26,060 --> 00:19:28,250
I think that's a nice little beginning 
piece of it.

438
00:19:28,460 --> 00:19:29,293
But what I really find fascinating about
it and why I've brought it up several 

439
00:19:32,031 --> 00:19:34,550
times is because the same things that 
you're talking about,

440
00:19:34,551 --> 00:19:35,384
how the regressive sort of infiltrated 
this and turned something that had 

441
00:19:38,451 --> 00:19:43,451
nothing to do with sexism or racism or 
any of these things.

442
00:19:44,090 --> 00:19:47,360
They made it about that.
And I think when I was on your show,

443
00:19:47,570 --> 00:19:48,500
I was saying how I,
you know,

444
00:19:48,501 --> 00:19:50,750
I used to be a huge gamer.
I'm not that much anymore,

445
00:19:50,751 --> 00:19:53,600
but I liked the community and I do play 
some games here and there.

446
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:54,981
But like,
you know,

447
00:19:54,981 --> 00:19:58,790
I played grand theft auto and yeah,
you could steal a car and punch a hooker

448
00:19:59,030 --> 00:20:00,710
and people would say,
well that's against women,

449
00:20:00,711 --> 00:20:01,544
but you could also punch your man.
So should they only have it that you'd 

450
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:04,333
only punch men.
I mean even the logic behind it doesn't 

451
00:20:06,321 --> 00:20:08,660
really stand to critique

452
00:20:09,210 --> 00:20:10,770
and the,
there is no winning ignorant.

453
00:20:10,790 --> 00:20:13,530
So the point is,
it's all in the school.

454
00:20:14,330 --> 00:20:16,410
It's either you are this thing or this 
thing,

455
00:20:16,411 --> 00:20:18,180
you don't even realize it,
you know,

456
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:21,810
and there's no falsifiability is one of 
the hypotheses.

457
00:20:22,190 --> 00:20:22,600
But the,
the,

458
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:23,880
the main problem,
if you think about it,

459
00:20:24,030 --> 00:20:26,550
like with grand theft auto.
So like what are the options?

460
00:20:26,730 --> 00:20:28,750
Not include women in the game.
No way they'd,

461
00:20:28,830 --> 00:20:31,020
they'd freak out if you couldn't put 
women in the game,

462
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:33,060
right?
Or you can have the women not being able

463
00:20:33,061 --> 00:20:35,170
to be treated like men again,
that'd be freaking out.

464
00:20:35,190 --> 00:20:37,510
That's not equal at all.
So what I mean,

465
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:38,353
what are you going to have?
You're going to have women and suddenly 

466
00:20:38,991 --> 00:20:40,890
it just can't be damaged or you know,
you,

467
00:20:40,891 --> 00:20:41,610
you,
you,

468
00:20:41,610 --> 00:20:44,100
they will not allow you to treat women 
like men.

469
00:20:44,101 --> 00:20:45,330
You know,
you can't beat up women,

470
00:20:45,331 --> 00:20:47,040
you can't,
but you can be tough men.

471
00:20:47,350 --> 00:20:49,550
And so you're,
you're in this position where you've got

472
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:50,433
no when,
you know there's no good answer and 

473
00:20:52,181 --> 00:20:54,970
that's how they want it.
They want you dancing to that team.

474
00:20:55,410 --> 00:20:56,820
Yeah.
And that's what,

475
00:20:56,850 --> 00:20:57,683
that's what's so fascinating about this 
and why I think it's so related to the 

476
00:21:00,091 --> 00:21:02,880
political situation with the 
regressives.

477
00:21:02,881 --> 00:21:03,714
And I also think that's why Gamergate 
blew up the way it did because gamers 

478
00:21:06,721 --> 00:21:07,554
generally are going to skew a little 
younger than the people that are solely 

479
00:21:09,931 --> 00:21:12,660
interested in politics.
So because of that,

480
00:21:12,661 --> 00:21:17,220
I think it was this group of people who 
had never been used to being attacked or

481
00:21:17,221 --> 00:21:18,054
silenced before and they were young and 
they were online and they were ready to 

482
00:21:21,991 --> 00:21:25,590
coalesce around something.
And I think that's what made it so,

483
00:21:25,591 --> 00:21:26,820
so magical or something,

484
00:21:27,220 --> 00:21:28,150
you know,
Gamers,

485
00:21:28,220 --> 00:21:30,190
gamers actually loan been the demon in 
the,

486
00:21:30,191 --> 00:21:31,960
uh,
in the bedroom.

487
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:36,580
Then I felt like the American Christians
in the late nineties,

488
00:21:36,581 --> 00:21:37,414
early two thousands,
there was Hillary Clinton under Joe 

489
00:21:40,020 --> 00:21:40,853
journeymen actually brought legislation 
to try and try and sort of sense of 

490
00:21:44,711 --> 00:21:45,544
video games.
So this is another reason I would never 

491
00:21:46,961 --> 00:21:47,800
vote for Hillary.
I mean,

492
00:21:47,830 --> 00:21:50,860
I don't think anyone ever should.
She's a corporate shell.

493
00:21:50,861 --> 00:21:53,140
Don't vote for Hillary,
but she,

494
00:21:53,160 --> 00:21:54,760
the ending,
there were so many reasons not to.

495
00:21:54,761 --> 00:21:55,520
Basically

496
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:56,710
we can get into that.

497
00:21:57,630 --> 00:21:58,463
Gamers are actually quite familiar with 
being attacked politically because of 

498
00:22:01,841 --> 00:22:02,674
that hobby.
Even though there hasn't been a single 

499
00:22:03,851 --> 00:22:07,510
study that's ever really conclusively 
proven anything about Video Games.

500
00:22:07,511 --> 00:22:08,080
In fact,
there are,

501
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:09,370
there are dozens that say,
well,

502
00:22:09,530 --> 00:22:11,770
there is no connection between video 
games and anything.

503
00:22:12,190 --> 00:22:14,050
You know,
if you look at the statistics,

504
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:17,680
the rise of video games just coincided 
with the dissenter violence.

505
00:22:17,890 --> 00:22:19,840
So I mean,
I'm not saying that connected,

506
00:22:19,841 --> 00:22:20,674
but it's one of those things that there 
is literally nothing to show the video 

507
00:22:23,921 --> 00:22:25,270
games or doing anything wrong.
In fact,

508
00:22:25,271 --> 00:22:26,660
there's quite a lot to show that doing a
lot of things.

509
00:22:26,750 --> 00:22:27,340
Wow.
Well,

510
00:22:27,340 --> 00:22:28,173
I remember that.
I think maybe it was around 91 or 92 

511
00:22:31,161 --> 00:22:34,310
when Joe Lieberman was leading that,
that fight against video games.

512
00:22:34,490 --> 00:22:35,323
I think it was because of mortal Kombat.
I was playing it on Sega Genesis at the 

513
00:22:38,181 --> 00:22:41,750
time and I would come home from school 
and play that for hours with my friends.

514
00:22:41,870 --> 00:22:45,050
I never ripped anyone skull out with 
their spine attached to it,

515
00:22:45,051 --> 00:22:47,630
you know what I mean?
Not once now.

516
00:22:47,631 --> 00:22:48,760
I tried once,
but I,

517
00:22:48,770 --> 00:22:50,330
yeah,
I never successfully did it.

518
00:22:50,510 --> 00:22:51,343
So that says something actually,
I think you can prove that it probably 

519
00:22:54,381 --> 00:22:58,700
helps people in a more healthy way than 
some of their anger and frustration.

520
00:22:58,701 --> 00:22:59,534
Don't you think?
No,

521
00:22:59,750 --> 00:23:01,640
I think the multiplayer games on there,
you know,

522
00:23:01,641 --> 00:23:02,474
they get,
they get groups of guys to hang out and 

523
00:23:03,831 --> 00:23:05,600
do something that's not dangerous or 
violent,

524
00:23:06,070 --> 00:23:07,040
you know,
and I think about it.

525
00:23:07,041 --> 00:23:07,874
I mean,
when I was a kid,

526
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,860
if one playing video games,
we were on the streets,

527
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:12,433
it was better for us to be at home 
playing video games than to not be 

528
00:23:14,961 --> 00:23:16,500
playing video games.
So,

529
00:23:16,501 --> 00:23:16,850
uh,
I,

530
00:23:16,850 --> 00:23:18,890
I honestly can't see where the 
objections come from.

531
00:23:18,930 --> 00:23:19,763
You know,
it's the same with anything like 

532
00:23:20,730 --> 00:23:23,540
dungeons and dragons in the ats or music
in the seventies,

533
00:23:23,780 --> 00:23:24,613
you know,
video games in the nineties and two 

534
00:23:25,461 --> 00:23:27,800
thousands there.
There is always something that we,

535
00:23:28,010 --> 00:23:29,480
you know,
poke clutching,

536
00:23:29,481 --> 00:23:30,314
moral majority or so they would like to 
position themselves as has got to rail 

537
00:23:34,410 --> 00:23:35,243
against something.
And ironically that was always the 

538
00:23:37,311 --> 00:23:38,470
religious rights,
you know,

539
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:41,420
that was always the highly religious 
authoritarian.

540
00:23:41,421 --> 00:23:45,860
Right now it is the highly regressive 
authoritarian left.

541
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:47,820
Yeah.
And this is the horseshoe theory that we

542
00:23:47,821 --> 00:23:51,630
talk about all the time that the 
extremes on both sides come together.

543
00:23:51,810 --> 00:23:53,090
Alright,
so last thought on Gamer Gate,

544
00:23:53,091 --> 00:23:53,924
you know,
the other thing that I think is really 

545
00:23:55,170 --> 00:23:58,590
nice about the community is that people 
who are gamers,

546
00:23:58,770 --> 00:24:02,820
it doesn't matter what race you are,
it doesn't matter what religion you are,

547
00:24:02,970 --> 00:24:03,803
what sex or sexuality,
any of the little dividing boxes that 

548
00:24:07,321 --> 00:24:10,350
the left wants to put us in.
It doesn't matter what you are.

549
00:24:10,410 --> 00:24:12,450
And that's why the community's so 
strong.

550
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:14,700
So then when,
when these people that are writing these

551
00:24:14,701 --> 00:24:15,534
articles say,
well gamers or sexist or gamers or 

552
00:24:17,551 --> 00:24:19,030
racist,
it actually,

553
00:24:19,031 --> 00:24:19,864
it literally has no meaning because it's
as diverse a community as you could 

554
00:24:22,761 --> 00:24:24,660
possibly put out there,
right?

555
00:24:25,020 --> 00:24:26,070
Yeah,
I mean it.

556
00:24:26,630 --> 00:24:27,463
You literally can't tell by playing a 
video game what race agenda The people 

557
00:24:30,921 --> 00:24:34,040
you're playing with are because everyone
gets to choose their own Avatar,

558
00:24:34,041 --> 00:24:35,390
but it gets customized.
Their name,

559
00:24:35,630 --> 00:24:37,760
you know,
that the only way you'd know is by voice

560
00:24:37,761 --> 00:24:38,594
chat know.
So for the vast majority of people 

561
00:24:41,090 --> 00:24:44,030
playing video games is not paid to 
identity politics.

562
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:45,153
And you know,
what's interesting is the regressive 

563
00:24:47,810 --> 00:24:48,643
academics actually did.
They spent a lot of times or planning 

564
00:24:51,831 --> 00:24:52,664
their assault on video games and they 
spent time doing research and there was 

565
00:24:56,600 --> 00:24:57,433
an academic feminist academic called 
Adrian who did a series of studies not 

566
00:25:02,570 --> 00:25:04,460
based on particularly large sample 
sizes,

567
00:25:04,461 --> 00:25:05,294
but large enough I would say to at least
give you the impression that they're 

568
00:25:08,181 --> 00:25:09,014
going the wrong direction because her 
conclusions and she was someone looking 

569
00:25:11,931 --> 00:25:13,270
for a way to sort of,
you know,

570
00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:16,580
crack open the video game industry with 
a good reason to attack it.

571
00:25:16,940 --> 00:25:20,120
She found that basically a mini games 
didn't need diversity.

572
00:25:20,410 --> 00:25:22,710
Video Games had diversity,
which meant that,

573
00:25:22,990 --> 00:25:24,800
you know,
and that in itself what,

574
00:25:24,801 --> 00:25:25,634
where,
where does the regressive begin their 

575
00:25:26,510 --> 00:25:30,440
plan of attack if the thing they're 
attacking is already diverse,

576
00:25:30,470 --> 00:25:32,540
you know.
And so basically it,

577
00:25:32,541 --> 00:25:33,374
it led to her reframing the study she 
had already conducted in a different 

578
00:25:37,941 --> 00:25:39,050
way.
And the,

579
00:25:39,080 --> 00:25:42,290
uh,
the language is very opaque,

580
00:25:42,650 --> 00:25:47,650
but basically she was not happy that 
there was a plurality of markets.

581
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:51,260
And now I personally think a plurality 
of markets is a wonderful thing.

582
00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:52,290
I think,
you know,

583
00:25:52,290 --> 00:25:53,123
if a video,
if you want video games about the 

584
00:25:55,640 --> 00:25:58,160
Japanese Hentai great,
that's your business.

585
00:25:58,161 --> 00:25:59,600
I'm not interested in that.
I will.

586
00:25:59,660 --> 00:26:01,340
I will video games about killing 
dinosaurs.

587
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:02,570
That's great.
That's my niche.

588
00:26:02,670 --> 00:26:04,670
And everyone gets their own niche,
you know,

589
00:26:04,671 --> 00:26:08,050
whereas the problem that they had is 
that they wanted hedge ammonia overlap.

590
00:26:08,360 --> 00:26:09,193
They didn't want a plurality of markets 
because then you could have diverse 

591
00:26:11,901 --> 00:26:13,520
market,
you can have marcus on by this.

592
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:14,593
They won't say every market to be 
controlled effectively by their 

593
00:26:17,811 --> 00:26:20,210
ideology.
And thankfully he's not going to happen.

594
00:26:20,330 --> 00:26:21,860
Right.
So just to be clear about that.

595
00:26:21,861 --> 00:26:22,694
So there are people that are probably 
playing Mario Kart that have nothing to 

596
00:26:26,361 --> 00:26:28,520
do with the people that are playing the 
games you're playing.

597
00:26:28,521 --> 00:26:31,520
So it doesn't make sense even to lump 
all those people together.

598
00:26:31,980 --> 00:26:32,813
Absolutely.
I mean there will obviously be some 

599
00:26:35,611 --> 00:26:38,520
crossover in every,
every game genre,

600
00:26:38,521 --> 00:26:39,354
but by and large you get people who have
different preferences and they play 

601
00:26:42,511 --> 00:26:44,090
different things.
Like I'm.

602
00:26:44,940 --> 00:26:46,770
One of the things I would say,
one of the things they,

603
00:26:46,771 --> 00:26:47,790
uh,
the big,

604
00:26:47,890 --> 00:26:48,800
slightly polite as,
oh,

605
00:26:48,920 --> 00:26:51,150
almost half of people playing video 
games or women.

606
00:26:51,170 --> 00:26:52,003
It's okay,
great,

607
00:26:52,420 --> 00:26:54,420
but what are they playing?
They don't play call of duty,

608
00:26:54,450 --> 00:26:55,283
you know,
they're not sitting there on their 

609
00:26:55,930 --> 00:26:56,763
xboxes but the headphones and running 
around calling each other gay that 

610
00:27:00,860 --> 00:27:01,693
playing candy crush and Farmville,
which all perfectly valid forms of 

611
00:27:05,131 --> 00:27:05,964
entertainment and more power to them.
I want them to play the games they want 

612
00:27:07,861 --> 00:27:09,270
to play.
But these,

613
00:27:09,330 --> 00:27:10,163
by,
you know,

614
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:13,980
by this point it doesn't justify 
changing anything about the games I play

615
00:27:14,280 --> 00:27:16,500
because of the games they play and vice 
versa is true.

616
00:27:16,501 --> 00:27:19,160
I don't want their games being changed 
to suit me either.

617
00:27:19,161 --> 00:27:19,994
You know,
that would be the last thing I would 

618
00:27:21,421 --> 00:27:22,254
want to impose on.
And so this is basically one of the 

619
00:27:25,081 --> 00:27:26,640
things the regressive left will always 
do,

620
00:27:26,641 --> 00:27:31,080
is use statistics and the most slippery 
way possible in Atlanta lies damn lies.

621
00:27:31,081 --> 00:27:33,780
And statistics really does apply it.
You,

622
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:35,033
I mean they,
they will use statistics to justify 

623
00:27:37,140 --> 00:27:37,973
anything.
So be be careful about the use of 

624
00:27:40,381 --> 00:27:41,820
statistics with the regressive left.

625
00:27:42,210 --> 00:27:43,043
All right,
so you've given me a perfect lane 

626
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:46,970
through Gamergate to talk about probably
your,

627
00:27:46,971 --> 00:27:47,804
your other favorite thing to talk about,
or at least maybe your most 

628
00:27:50,011 --> 00:27:52,770
controversial thing to talk about,
which is feminism.

629
00:27:53,370 --> 00:27:55,110
Uh,
so let's,

630
00:27:55,140 --> 00:27:58,140
let's go there.
Let's talk a little feminism A.

631
00:27:58,141 --> 00:28:00,000
I'm going to give you this in the most 
broad sense.

632
00:28:00,001 --> 00:28:03,570
Basically you don't like what the 
feminist movement has become.

633
00:28:03,571 --> 00:28:04,404
Is that fair to say?

634
00:28:04,950 --> 00:28:06,400
Yes.
And the,

635
00:28:07,080 --> 00:28:07,913
one of the dangers of talking about 
feminism is that it's very often 

636
00:28:11,131 --> 00:28:15,840
conflated with women and this is done 
through eight women who exactly you're a

637
00:28:15,841 --> 00:28:16,674
misogynist.
Last thing you will hear if ever you 

638
00:28:19,021 --> 00:28:20,830
have any complaint about feminism,
um,

639
00:28:21,510 --> 00:28:23,640
however,
I mean this is just obviously logically,

640
00:28:24,370 --> 00:28:25,500
it's not,
it's not,

641
00:28:26,070 --> 00:28:26,903
it's nonsense.
Feminism itself as an ideology and 

642
00:28:28,681 --> 00:28:29,514
you've got male and female feminists and
you get people who are male and female 

643
00:28:32,011 --> 00:28:32,844
opposed to modern feminism.
So the idea that feminism is inherently 

644
00:28:37,230 --> 00:28:39,630
the same as women is ridiculous.
And the thing is,

645
00:28:39,660 --> 00:28:44,280
even the fewer and fewer women every 
year are identifying as feminists at the

646
00:28:44,281 --> 00:28:45,480
moment in,
in America,

647
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:48,810
only about 18 percent of women identify 
as feminists.

648
00:28:48,811 --> 00:28:51,060
And I knew something about nine percent 
of men,

649
00:28:51,330 --> 00:28:53,100
whereas in,
in say the seventies,

650
00:28:53,101 --> 00:28:54,750
it was similar as high as 40 percent.

651
00:28:55,050 --> 00:28:57,970
So the feminist movement is honestly,
I think,

652
00:28:57,971 --> 00:28:59,490
I don't think he's doing yourself any 
favors.

653
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:02,580
I think it's gotten full regressive.
That's the problem.

654
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:03,630
Um,
you know,

655
00:29:03,630 --> 00:29:06,510
I,
I would have no problem calling myself a

656
00:29:06,511 --> 00:29:09,810
feminist if we were in the era of say,
second wave feminism.

657
00:29:10,010 --> 00:29:14,050
We had some equity feminism to Christina
Hoff sommers oh,

658
00:29:14,070 --> 00:29:17,820
Camille Paglia would be espousing this 
whole equal rights,

659
00:29:17,821 --> 00:29:22,821
equal pay or the sort of the sort of 
things that you as any egalitarian would

660
00:29:23,101 --> 00:29:25,920
be completely on board with and would 
find absolutely no objection to.

661
00:29:25,921 --> 00:29:26,754
I find that objection to.
But my problem is when we start getting 

662
00:29:29,461 --> 00:29:30,294
into the realms of,
well I mean shaming language for you 

663
00:29:32,300 --> 00:29:34,290
were misogynistic,
this you about you the other,

664
00:29:34,710 --> 00:29:37,530
when you have any objection and quoters 
or any,

665
00:29:37,531 --> 00:29:38,840
anything like this,
you know,

666
00:29:39,080 --> 00:29:41,230
and then you,
then you get into conspiracy theories,

667
00:29:41,231 --> 00:29:43,090
patriarchy theory,
you know,

668
00:29:43,390 --> 00:29:44,770
and then it becomes intersectional.

669
00:29:44,770 --> 00:29:49,770
So now involves race and transsexuals 
and homosexuals and now it's a karaoke.

670
00:29:51,161 --> 00:29:55,510
This is an insult linking a series of 
oppressions and privileges.

671
00:29:55,540 --> 00:29:58,200
And really you realize that what you 
want your luggage,

672
00:29:58,210 --> 00:30:01,330
you say seeing is Marxist rhetoric.
It's all.

673
00:30:01,331 --> 00:30:03,130
I mean if you read the communist 
manifesto,

674
00:30:03,180 --> 00:30:05,000
you understand modern feminism,
you know,

675
00:30:05,030 --> 00:30:05,863
you were talking about the male 
bourgeoisie and the female promaths 

676
00:30:08,890 --> 00:30:11,380
Harriet's and it's the same with black 
and white,

677
00:30:11,381 --> 00:30:13,090
straight and gay and all these sort of 
things.

678
00:30:13,091 --> 00:30:13,924
And I just don't ascribe to that because
it implies a shared experience that we 

679
00:30:17,561 --> 00:30:19,840
know men and women don't have.
You know,

680
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:22,070
I mean,
and not just men and women,

681
00:30:22,071 --> 00:30:22,904
like black people,
any of Trayvon Martin did not have the 

682
00:30:25,121 --> 00:30:27,670
same life experiences as Barack Obama,
you know?

683
00:30:27,700 --> 00:30:28,533
And so to say that being black is some 
sort of inherent shared oppression that 

684
00:30:31,901 --> 00:30:33,610
they have is ridiculous,
you know,

685
00:30:33,670 --> 00:30:35,350
it just,
it doesn't work.

686
00:30:35,350 --> 00:30:40,350
And my main problem really is,
is that it's become anti individualistic

687
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:41,591
the.
I mean,

688
00:30:41,591 --> 00:30:44,920
you get famous feminist like any sockies
and who will literally say things like,

689
00:30:45,250 --> 00:30:46,360
um,
individuals,

690
00:30:46,361 --> 00:30:49,330
women,
individual women's choices don't count.

691
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:52,980
What Matt says is,
what methods is feminism of the great,

692
00:30:52,981 --> 00:30:54,580
you know,
something for the greater good feminism,

693
00:30:54,630 --> 00:30:55,463
something.
I can't remember exactly how the quote 

694
00:30:56,951 --> 00:30:57,784
goes,
but it was just one of those things 

695
00:30:58,091 --> 00:30:59,440
where it's just like,
okay,

696
00:30:59,560 --> 00:31:01,960
I,
I'm so totally against this,

697
00:31:01,961 --> 00:31:04,720
that I think I would be prepared to 
fight a civil war against,

698
00:31:04,770 --> 00:31:05,603
you know,
these are so anti anti liberal 

699
00:31:08,801 --> 00:31:10,180
principles.
I can't stand them.

700
00:31:10,940 --> 00:31:15,170
So in a way it's evolved to where it's 
no longer first off,

701
00:31:15,171 --> 00:31:16,004
women are a minority.
I think there's something like 50 slash 

702
00:31:17,410 --> 00:31:19,100
50,
one or 52 percent of the population,

703
00:31:19,101 --> 00:31:22,280
but where,
where you should be for the minority and

704
00:31:22,281 --> 00:31:23,700
a minority.
Uh,

705
00:31:23,860 --> 00:31:25,850
what you're saying is that they're 
fighting,

706
00:31:25,930 --> 00:31:28,400
they're eliminating the minority in the 
minority.

707
00:31:28,550 --> 00:31:29,383
I think an example of that we could use 
from the American political space would 

708
00:31:32,421 --> 00:31:33,860
be someone like Sarah Pailin.
Now,

709
00:31:33,861 --> 00:31:37,730
I don't like the views that Sarah Pailin
espouses spouses at all,

710
00:31:38,260 --> 00:31:39,950
but can you believe that?
Yeah.

711
00:31:39,951 --> 00:31:43,700
I'm not a big fan of Sarah Pailin.
That being said,

712
00:31:43,730 --> 00:31:48,730
she's obviously a very influential and 
powerful and a self motivated woman.

713
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:52,580
So in a certain sense,
she's the ultimate,

714
00:31:52,970 --> 00:31:55,490
uh,
goal of what a feminist should be.

715
00:31:55,491 --> 00:31:57,050
But feminists hate her,
right?

716
00:31:57,500 --> 00:31:58,180
Absolutely.
[inaudible].

717
00:31:58,180 --> 00:31:59,810
She thinks wrong.
What's the problem?

718
00:31:59,811 --> 00:32:00,644
She,
she doesn't spinals she doesn't espouse 

719
00:32:02,450 --> 00:32:04,370
a regressive ideology.
She doesn't.

720
00:32:04,580 --> 00:32:06,470
I mean,
if she called herself a feminist,

721
00:32:07,070 --> 00:32:10,160
fundamentally she wouldn't be invoking 
Marxist ideas.

722
00:32:10,430 --> 00:32:13,140
She would be invoking sorts of 
libertarian ideas.

723
00:32:13,290 --> 00:32:15,410
So the strength of the individual hard 
work,

724
00:32:15,411 --> 00:32:16,340
you know,
all these.

725
00:32:16,790 --> 00:32:17,780
Honestly I think that,
you know,

726
00:32:17,781 --> 00:32:19,250
they're not,
they're not bad ideas at all,

727
00:32:19,520 --> 00:32:24,440
but she wouldn't be in the same camp as 
say Gloria Steinem Steinem or bell hooks

728
00:32:24,441 --> 00:32:26,580
or someone like that.
I don't.

729
00:32:27,540 --> 00:32:29,650
It's weird talking about Marxism.
You know,

730
00:32:29,651 --> 00:32:32,110
it's really weird because,
I mean almost no,

731
00:32:32,150 --> 00:32:35,630
nobody really understands it these days 
and any people understand it,

732
00:32:35,650 --> 00:32:38,060
the academics and universities who teach
it,

733
00:32:38,120 --> 00:32:38,953
and it is the manifesto is the third 
most prescribed book in universities in 

734
00:32:43,281 --> 00:32:46,220
America.
Just seeing the communist manifesto.

735
00:32:46,790 --> 00:32:49,280
Communism died everywhere.
But in the west,

736
00:32:49,340 --> 00:32:50,360
it's so bizarre.

737
00:32:51,080 --> 00:32:52,910
We fetishize these things,
right?

738
00:32:53,300 --> 00:32:54,170
Absolutely.
People,

739
00:32:54,171 --> 00:32:57,050
people who live under communism hates 
communism,

740
00:32:57,350 --> 00:32:59,120
they think is a terrible idea.
They know that.

741
00:32:59,121 --> 00:32:59,720
I mean,
they,

742
00:32:59,720 --> 00:33:02,180
they had secure at three in the morning 
for milk and eggs,

743
00:33:02,181 --> 00:33:04,070
you know,
they think is a terrible idea,

744
00:33:04,310 --> 00:33:05,143
but the people in the west have never 
lived through being put into practice 

745
00:33:08,870 --> 00:33:11,270
and so they don't understand it's,
you know,

746
00:33:11,280 --> 00:33:16,280
they don't really viscerally understand 
the real true nature of it I guess.

747
00:33:16,790 --> 00:33:18,040
And so,
you know,

748
00:33:18,090 --> 00:33:18,923
when you're sitting in a comfortable 
house that's been built under 

749
00:33:21,441 --> 00:33:23,240
capitalistic system and you've got lots 
of money and you've,

750
00:33:23,450 --> 00:33:24,950
you're doing very well for yourself.
You thinking,

751
00:33:25,260 --> 00:33:26,270
well,
maybe we should,

752
00:33:26,300 --> 00:33:28,340
you know,
maybe maybe it's not such a bad idea and

753
00:33:28,360 --> 00:33:29,193
it's,
you know,

754
00:33:30,120 --> 00:33:32,390
but it's,
it's these principles that inform almost

755
00:33:32,391 --> 00:33:34,880
everything about third wave feminism.
It's all about,

756
00:33:35,240 --> 00:33:37,550
it's all about power dynamics,
privileged and oppressed,

757
00:33:37,551 --> 00:33:38,384
privileged and oppressed,
which is why I was watching the young 

758
00:33:39,741 --> 00:33:40,460
Turks the other day.

759
00:33:40,460 --> 00:33:42,590
In fact,
Jimmy Doyle,

760
00:33:42,591 --> 00:33:44,170
I think it was a,
he,

761
00:33:44,180 --> 00:33:45,013
he actually had his tongue in his mouth 
and he was saying that he was for the 

762
00:33:49,371 --> 00:33:52,310
oppressed in every situation.
So he took the example of Israel.

763
00:33:52,311 --> 00:33:54,800
So Israel oppressed as a Palestinian 
man.

764
00:33:54,801 --> 00:33:56,120
He's in February,
the Palestinian man.

765
00:33:56,360 --> 00:33:57,890
And then if the Palestinian amount of 
presses,

766
00:33:57,891 --> 00:33:58,724
his wife,
he's a fair for the wife and it's just 

767
00:33:59,961 --> 00:34:00,150
like,
yeah,

768
00:34:00,150 --> 00:34:00,983
but you've,
you've just said you are and are not in 

769
00:34:04,281 --> 00:34:06,170
favor of the Palestinian man there,
Jenny,

770
00:34:06,430 --> 00:34:07,610
you know,
that is inherently cultural.

771
00:34:07,611 --> 00:34:09,560
You can't,
you can't be in favor of the man and the

772
00:34:09,561 --> 00:34:10,850
wife,
you know,

773
00:34:10,880 --> 00:34:12,590
at the same time.
Which one are you in favor of?

774
00:34:12,610 --> 00:34:13,760
You know,
it's that kind of,

775
00:34:14,470 --> 00:34:15,303
it's got this inherent contradiction to 
it and they don't seem to want to 

776
00:34:18,231 --> 00:34:18,770
acknowledge that.

777
00:34:18,770 --> 00:34:19,603
Yeah,
and that's why as we've said for awhile 

778
00:34:21,350 --> 00:34:23,930
and now this,
this regressive ideology,

779
00:34:24,170 --> 00:34:25,003
it's always putting narrative over fact.
That's really the most when you whittle 

780
00:34:29,451 --> 00:34:33,790
it down to what it really is,
it has to be narrative over fact.

781
00:34:33,950 --> 00:34:38,540
So you just pick the most depressed and 
then you get everybody on the ladder and

782
00:34:38,541 --> 00:34:39,374
then that's how you judge everybody,
which is the reverse of judging a 

783
00:34:41,661 --> 00:34:45,500
minority within a minority and those are
the people that we should be for.

784
00:34:46,070 --> 00:34:47,120
Yeah,
absolutely.

785
00:34:47,121 --> 00:34:47,954
In the crazy thing about it as well is 
that these things are inherently racist 

786
00:34:51,711 --> 00:34:54,230
and sexist and any other issue you want 
to.

787
00:34:54,590 --> 00:34:57,350
But the problem is that normally when 
people think,

788
00:34:57,351 --> 00:34:58,220
oh,
you're being a racist,

789
00:34:58,250 --> 00:35:03,250
you think you're being racist to the,
I guess the oppressed if that's what you

790
00:35:03,351 --> 00:35:04,184
want is called the minority who have 
suffered from racial discrimination 

791
00:35:07,070 --> 00:35:07,903
past,
you know,

792
00:35:08,390 --> 00:35:09,223
black people or you know,
you're pressing women or something like 

793
00:35:10,521 --> 00:35:13,310
that.
But racism and sexism,

794
00:35:13,340 --> 00:35:15,230
despite what the regressives will tell 
you,

795
00:35:15,710 --> 00:35:18,750
I'm not structures or systems of power,
their principles,

796
00:35:18,950 --> 00:35:20,090
their ideas,
they are,

797
00:35:20,150 --> 00:35:23,270
they'll,
they'll ways of viewing the world and so

798
00:35:23,300 --> 00:35:27,710
you can be racist to white people,
you can be sexist to men and vice versa.

799
00:35:27,711 --> 00:35:31,020
And so it's this kind of,
let's say the narrative they've,

800
00:35:31,080 --> 00:35:31,913
they've gone out of the way to redefine 
a bunch of woods and then they have 

801
00:35:34,250 --> 00:35:35,083
cherry picked data points to arrive,
a nice location where they can say you 

802
00:35:39,241 --> 00:35:41,550
as a white man and not allowed to speak.
Why?

803
00:35:41,551 --> 00:35:42,384
Because you're a white man and they will
literally turn around and tell you that 

804
00:35:45,390 --> 00:35:46,470
is not racist and sexist.

805
00:35:46,620 --> 00:35:47,453
I think it's amazing.
You give them enough credit to say 

806
00:35:48,571 --> 00:35:49,404
they've picked these data points because
I think in most cases they haven't even 

807
00:35:52,381 --> 00:35:53,470
gotten that far.
You're,

808
00:35:53,471 --> 00:35:57,150
you're giving them the benefit of the 
doubt that I can no longer give them.

809
00:35:57,300 --> 00:36:00,240
But we started here on feminism.
So let's not go too far.

810
00:36:00,360 --> 00:36:01,193
But.
But that's the interesting thing that 

811
00:36:01,861 --> 00:36:03,570
every time I'm talking about all this 
stuff,

812
00:36:03,720 --> 00:36:04,553
we realize how the Inter.
There's this interlink theme between 

813
00:36:06,871 --> 00:36:08,400
Gamergate,
between feminism,

814
00:36:08,401 --> 00:36:09,450
all of this stuff.
So,

815
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:11,010
uh,
as far as feminism,

816
00:36:11,011 --> 00:36:11,844
I saw an interesting video that you did 
where you took the three types of what 

817
00:36:16,111 --> 00:36:18,450
you said were the three types of male 
feminists.

818
00:36:18,670 --> 00:36:19,503
Um,
and I thought it was really interesting 

819
00:36:21,240 --> 00:36:23,550
because I was,
because I defend women,

820
00:36:23,551 --> 00:36:24,200
I,
I,

821
00:36:24,200 --> 00:36:26,970
I believe women should be equal.
Uh,

822
00:36:26,971 --> 00:36:27,804
and that's pretty much it,
so anyone can define me however they 

823
00:36:31,081 --> 00:36:31,914
want,
but I thought the way you broke these 

824
00:36:32,851 --> 00:36:35,040
three type of men down was pretty 
interesting.

825
00:36:35,041 --> 00:36:36,180
Can you do that for us?

826
00:36:36,570 --> 00:36:37,580
Um.
Oh God,

827
00:36:37,581 --> 00:36:38,650
it was while ago.
Did that video.

828
00:36:38,651 --> 00:36:41,150
I can't remember it now.
Okay.

829
00:36:41,151 --> 00:36:44,090
So yeah,
it's basically self interest I think.

830
00:36:44,290 --> 00:36:45,530
I mean,
you get some,

831
00:36:46,080 --> 00:36:46,913
you get men who are the,
they want to be rewarded for doing 

832
00:36:51,351 --> 00:36:56,351
something heroic and protective and I 
think that a change might fall into this

833
00:36:57,111 --> 00:36:59,840
category where he's easy.
He's a big guy,

834
00:36:59,841 --> 00:37:01,380
he's not he himself,
that,

835
00:37:01,390 --> 00:37:02,223
you know,
this doesn't have any particular fears 

836
00:37:05,510 --> 00:37:07,460
in,
for his own physical security.

837
00:37:07,700 --> 00:37:08,533
And so he thinks I'm going to use my 
physical presence to protect women 

838
00:37:11,781 --> 00:37:13,520
because that would be a,
a,

839
00:37:13,670 --> 00:37:14,930
you know,
a laudable thing to do.

840
00:37:14,990 --> 00:37:15,823
And it would be,
except that they're doing it for their 

841
00:37:17,751 --> 00:37:21,050
own self interests that don't get thrown
for the,

842
00:37:21,080 --> 00:37:22,160
for their own personal feelings.

843
00:37:22,950 --> 00:37:25,250
The other end of the day,
this is a guy who basically wants to get

844
00:37:25,251 --> 00:37:26,240
laid.
I mean,

845
00:37:26,241 --> 00:37:27,170
in a lot of respects,

846
00:37:27,370 --> 00:37:28,800
I don't want to put it that way,
but yeah,

847
00:37:28,801 --> 00:37:30,220
I kind of Miss.
It's,

848
00:37:30,450 --> 00:37:32,420
the thing is it's not necessarily 
getting lady though love.

849
00:37:32,550 --> 00:37:36,480
A lot of it is just for just for the 
sort of emotional reward,

850
00:37:36,660 --> 00:37:38,490
you know,
because like a social.

851
00:37:39,380 --> 00:37:39,961
Yeah.
Yeah.

852
00:37:39,961 --> 00:37:41,210
And,
and just just,

853
00:37:41,220 --> 00:37:43,890
um,
just to get the pat on the head,

854
00:37:44,010 --> 00:37:44,601
you know,
it's,

855
00:37:44,601 --> 00:37:47,130
it's kind of to feel good about 
themselves,

856
00:37:47,550 --> 00:37:49,650
but requires permission from someone 
else.

857
00:37:49,740 --> 00:37:51,930
This case being a woman.
And the thing is you end up,

858
00:37:52,020 --> 00:37:53,250
you end up getting ready,
sort of,

859
00:37:53,251 --> 00:37:56,670
um,
really unhealthy dynamics because you'll

860
00:37:56,700 --> 00:37:59,760
find women who are looking for men to do
things for.

861
00:38:00,200 --> 00:38:01,033
And you will find men who are looking to
do things for women and you will get 

862
00:38:03,751 --> 00:38:07,230
this kind of feedback loop where they'll
reinforce each other,

863
00:38:07,231 --> 00:38:08,064
you know,
this,

864
00:38:08,140 --> 00:38:10,620
this,
this guy stands up for this woman who is

865
00:38:10,621 --> 00:38:12,960
using him to fight her battles.

866
00:38:13,340 --> 00:38:17,700
And so this guy ends up fighting battles
on his battles but are being reinforced,

867
00:38:17,701 --> 00:38:19,320
constantly buy.
And again,

868
00:38:19,321 --> 00:38:21,870
this is not like all women in most women
are not like this,

869
00:38:21,871 --> 00:38:23,060
but you will,
you know,

870
00:38:23,130 --> 00:38:26,310
women are humans too and you get bad 
women as well as good women.

871
00:38:26,670 --> 00:38:27,503
And you find that this,
this is basically one of the problems 

872
00:38:30,241 --> 00:38:32,430
with the progressive because like we 
were saying earlier,

873
00:38:32,610 --> 00:38:34,620
and I hate to come back to like 
progresses,

874
00:38:34,621 --> 00:38:35,454
but feminism is just one like brunch and
under the umbrella of the progressive 

875
00:38:39,581 --> 00:38:40,540
sort of tree,
I guess,

876
00:38:40,541 --> 00:38:41,374
you know,
it's,

877
00:38:41,390 --> 00:38:43,000
it,
it all ties together.

878
00:38:43,420 --> 00:38:44,253
Um,
but you said you get most people when 

879
00:38:45,731 --> 00:38:47,080
they think they're doing it for the 
right reasons.

880
00:38:47,110 --> 00:38:47,943
You know,
they think,

881
00:38:47,950 --> 00:38:48,820
well,
I'm a good person.

882
00:38:48,850 --> 00:38:51,640
I need to be helping women in minorities
and gays and Trans and whatever.

883
00:38:52,510 --> 00:38:53,343
But the,
the problem is that they have this kind 

884
00:38:56,381 --> 00:39:00,730
of toolbox of rhetoric that virtue 
signals to other regressives.

885
00:39:00,760 --> 00:39:01,960
It shows them say,
hey look,

886
00:39:02,230 --> 00:39:04,960
I'm using this kind of language,
therefore I'm on your team.

887
00:39:05,170 --> 00:39:07,420
You can come and support me on twitter 
or wherever you know,

888
00:39:07,940 --> 00:39:10,540
and,
and so you will get people who think,

889
00:39:11,020 --> 00:39:11,471
okay,
great,

890
00:39:11,471 --> 00:39:14,140
I'm going to do that because I'm always 
wanting to be an activist onto something

891
00:39:14,141 --> 00:39:14,974
good.
And then you'll get the other kind of 

892
00:39:16,181 --> 00:39:18,640
person who is the more malicious person 
who will think,

893
00:39:18,820 --> 00:39:21,190
great,
I can use this to my own advantage.

894
00:39:21,730 --> 00:39:23,860
And they are the people you've got to be
really worried about.

895
00:39:23,861 --> 00:39:25,040
I mean,
there's a.

896
00:39:25,090 --> 00:39:27,370
In gamer gate,
there was a woman called Randy Harper.

897
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:29,260
She wasn't actually pop game gay.
She was part of the problem,

898
00:39:29,650 --> 00:39:31,040
but some,
the,

899
00:39:31,060 --> 00:39:31,893
the.
I've never seen it most starkly 

900
00:39:33,041 --> 00:39:36,940
represented than in her example,
I think it was 2011,

901
00:39:36,941 --> 00:39:38,170
2012.
She,

902
00:39:38,171 --> 00:39:39,760
uh,
she was on a BSD,

903
00:39:39,761 --> 00:39:42,280
which is a programming language,
a podcast.

904
00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:44,290
And she was literally saying,
well,

905
00:39:44,291 --> 00:39:46,090
I'm a woman in tech and I don't have a 
problem with this.

906
00:39:46,091 --> 00:39:46,780
You know,
I think,

907
00:39:46,780 --> 00:39:50,200
I think the feminists have of blowing 
this problem with ms dot progeny and the

908
00:39:50,201 --> 00:39:52,300
tech industry and all this other stuff.
I'm a women in tech.

909
00:39:52,301 --> 00:39:53,680
I have no problem.
Everything's great.

910
00:39:54,130 --> 00:39:54,963
And Lo behold,
two years later when it's shown to be a 

911
00:39:56,681 --> 00:39:59,950
profitable business model,
she is literally on twitter.

912
00:39:59,951 --> 00:40:02,890
Say I'm an oppressed woman in Tech.
I need your money,

913
00:40:02,891 --> 00:40:03,724
you know,
give me money every month through 

914
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:06,200
patriots and also,
and the,

915
00:40:06,240 --> 00:40:08,800
the,
just the complete polar opposite of what

916
00:40:08,801 --> 00:40:10,150
you were saying before.
And it's like really?

917
00:40:10,300 --> 00:40:13,540
So either the industry has become 
massively sexist overnights.

918
00:40:14,230 --> 00:40:16,400
You found a way to profit.
So you know,

919
00:40:16,420 --> 00:40:17,060
and so,

920
00:40:17,060 --> 00:40:19,700
so this is sort of something we could 
find with any movement.

921
00:40:19,701 --> 00:40:21,380
So I don't think,
I don't think you're saying this,

922
00:40:21,381 --> 00:40:23,570
but that this isn't specific to 
feminism.

923
00:40:23,660 --> 00:40:24,493
Any movements can have.
It's people who are doing it with the 

924
00:40:26,181 --> 00:40:27,014
right intentions.
It's going to have the people that are 

925
00:40:28,491 --> 00:40:29,324
being guilted into it.
It's going to have the people that are 

926
00:40:30,411 --> 00:40:31,244
being tricked into it.
It's gonna have the people that can 

927
00:40:32,061 --> 00:40:34,490
profit from it all.
Every single movement.

928
00:40:34,491 --> 00:40:36,740
And you're just using feminism is one 
example.

929
00:40:36,830 --> 00:40:38,120
I don't want people to say,
well,

930
00:40:38,121 --> 00:40:39,160
you see,
he's,

931
00:40:39,161 --> 00:40:43,070
he's trying to mock up what feminism is 
or something to that effect.

932
00:40:43,110 --> 00:40:43,630
Yeah.
No,

933
00:40:43,630 --> 00:40:43,930
no,
no,

934
00:40:43,930 --> 00:40:45,020
no,
you're right.

935
00:40:45,030 --> 00:40:46,230
This,
this is again,

936
00:40:46,231 --> 00:40:47,064
it's not necessarily feminism because 
feminism is just a subsection of the 

937
00:40:49,341 --> 00:40:50,790
social justice movement.
You know,

938
00:40:50,791 --> 00:40:55,791
you've got some,
they call it into sectionalism is like,

939
00:40:56,000 --> 00:41:00,690
there's bell hooks describes it as the 
white supremacist capitalist patriarchy.

940
00:41:01,050 --> 00:41:01,883
I'm not surprising you are.
You are a supporter of the white 

941
00:41:05,521 --> 00:41:09,560
supremacist capitalist Patriarchy date.
I actually propagates.

942
00:41:09,561 --> 00:41:10,860
I'm,
I'm a terrible person.

943
00:41:11,230 --> 00:41:12,970
But basically what this encompasses is,
is,

944
00:41:13,210 --> 00:41:14,043
uh,
the dynamics between black people and 

945
00:41:15,151 --> 00:41:16,500
white people.
The white supremacy,

946
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:17,713
a,
the capitalism is the poor and the rich 

947
00:41:19,740 --> 00:41:21,700
and the patriarchy being men and women.
Um,

948
00:41:21,810 --> 00:41:25,150
I think they probably have terms for gay
and straight and Trans and CIS.

949
00:41:25,470 --> 00:41:27,600
But I'm not familiar with them off the 
top of my head,

950
00:41:27,820 --> 00:41:29,940
but this is.
This is the point at some,

951
00:41:30,660 --> 00:41:34,220
they have this toolbox of tubs and they 
have a academic background.

952
00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:36,610
All of this comes from academia.
All of this,

953
00:41:36,650 --> 00:41:37,700
you know,
this has all been.

954
00:41:38,030 --> 00:41:38,751
And People Think,
oh,

955
00:41:38,751 --> 00:41:40,100
this is coming from tumblr.
It's like,

956
00:41:40,101 --> 00:41:40,934
no,
tomorrow is the outgrowth of this 

957
00:41:43,090 --> 00:41:43,923
council.
You know,

958
00:41:44,080 --> 00:41:46,760
this is coming to the surface in popular
culture.

959
00:41:46,940 --> 00:41:49,400
This all comes from sorts of,
you know,

960
00:41:49,401 --> 00:41:52,490
the halls of academia where they,
they start with a premise,

961
00:41:52,520 --> 00:41:55,700
they confirm their biases,
the peer review,

962
00:41:55,701 --> 00:41:56,534
that own papers between feminists and 
then they carry on building from that 

963
00:41:59,271 --> 00:42:01,220
until they've got to the point where 
they will,

964
00:42:02,150 --> 00:42:03,830
like I said,
the redefinition of things.

965
00:42:03,860 --> 00:42:04,693
The reason,
the reason the progressives are so 

966
00:42:06,681 --> 00:42:09,200
dangerous is of course,
as you said,

967
00:42:09,201 --> 00:42:10,034
with every movement,
you're going to get people who are 

968
00:42:10,890 --> 00:42:12,080
profit,
Terry Union,

969
00:42:12,081 --> 00:42:13,550
people doing it for their own selfish 
reasons,

970
00:42:14,180 --> 00:42:15,013
but I can't think of any movement that 
legitimately has an excuse to be 

971
00:42:21,291 --> 00:42:24,200
malevolent to people for any good 
reason.

972
00:42:24,290 --> 00:42:25,123
You know,
almost every single one he let Christy 

973
00:42:26,070 --> 00:42:27,770
has been love.
You love your neighbor as yourself,

974
00:42:28,070 --> 00:42:28,903
you know,
and like for very individualistic Zena 

975
00:42:31,470 --> 00:42:33,290
individual rights in representative 
democracy,

976
00:42:33,291 --> 00:42:35,390
everyone gets to be treated in a 
universal,

977
00:42:35,600 --> 00:42:37,400
you know,
the Brotherhood of man and all that sort

978
00:42:37,401 --> 00:42:38,234
of thing.
Whereas these people have something 

979
00:42:39,531 --> 00:42:40,730
different.
They actually have,

980
00:42:41,420 --> 00:42:42,300
and I,
I,

981
00:42:42,420 --> 00:42:45,170
I can't remember which feminists that is
and I'm quoting and they say this,

982
00:42:45,470 --> 00:42:46,303
I think it's Andrea.
Talk Him when they say that women have 

983
00:42:47,991 --> 00:42:48,824
the right to hate their oppresses.
Now this is for me a particularly scary 

984
00:42:53,931 --> 00:42:55,520
aspect of it.
And it goes,

985
00:42:55,550 --> 00:42:58,130
it goes totally for what the black lives
matter movement,

986
00:42:58,460 --> 00:43:00,830
who all subscribed to this kind of 
ideology.

987
00:43:01,370 --> 00:43:02,203
It's the,
it's the way of legitimizing hatred for 

988
00:43:06,141 --> 00:43:10,130
people based on what is perceived to be 
social advantages.

989
00:43:10,460 --> 00:43:11,660
So if they say,
well,

990
00:43:11,661 --> 00:43:13,550
you're a white man,
therefore you have special lunches,

991
00:43:13,760 --> 00:43:16,400
therefore it's not bad for me to hate 
you.

992
00:43:16,730 --> 00:43:19,580
You know I can,
I can say all sorts of things to you and

993
00:43:19,581 --> 00:43:22,220
it's okay because you have privilege.
I'm oppressed.

994
00:43:22,280 --> 00:43:23,420
You're privileged.
Therefore,

995
00:43:23,421 --> 00:43:25,580
no matter what I say to you,
it doesn't matter,

996
00:43:25,581 --> 00:43:28,460
even though in an interpersonal 
interaction,

997
00:43:28,700 --> 00:43:31,030
if you say some horrible things to me,
I'm helped by,

998
00:43:31,040 --> 00:43:31,850
you know,
I'm a,

999
00:43:31,850 --> 00:43:34,190
I'm a regular person.
Like my white privilege isn't actually a

1000
00:43:34,191 --> 00:43:36,260
shield from horrible word.

1001
00:43:36,510 --> 00:43:36,960
Also,
it,

1002
00:43:36,960 --> 00:43:37,793
it,
it takes the distinction away from 

1003
00:43:39,011 --> 00:43:39,844
someone from a male who is doing 
everything he can to fight for women's 

1004
00:43:45,731 --> 00:43:46,564
rights and equality.
And I'm an a man who is against those 

1005
00:43:49,361 --> 00:43:50,194
things.
If you just say it's white men or it's 

1006
00:43:51,460 --> 00:43:53,140
just men.
And we saw this,

1007
00:43:53,150 --> 00:43:53,983
a great example of this I think is a 
couple of weeks ago with those Cologne 

1008
00:43:56,921 --> 00:43:57,754
attacks,
and I saw all these feminists writing 

1009
00:43:59,831 --> 00:44:02,830
articles and tweeting saying things are,
this is,

1010
00:44:02,831 --> 00:44:06,160
it's not a,
this isn't a migrant problem,

1011
00:44:06,161 --> 00:44:06,994
this isn't a religion problem.
They were doing everything to get it 

1012
00:44:09,641 --> 00:44:14,641
away from the identity of the specific 
people who did this and try,

1013
00:44:15,410 --> 00:44:18,730
this is a male problem.
Now this is crazy.

1014
00:44:18,760 --> 00:44:19,960
This is actually crazy.

1015
00:44:20,270 --> 00:44:21,103
It's insane.
What happened in Cologne was something 

1016
00:44:22,881 --> 00:44:26,630
called Tara rush a,
which is just Arabic,

1017
00:44:26,631 --> 00:44:29,470
the group assault or sexual assaults.
Um,

1018
00:44:29,590 --> 00:44:33,150
and it's something that happens.
Think the first instance of it was,

1019
00:44:33,151 --> 00:44:35,130
I think it was originally recorded in 
the fifties,

1020
00:44:35,131 --> 00:44:35,964
but I guess it kind of wasn't something 
that really came to the surface until 

1021
00:44:38,791 --> 00:44:43,791
about 2011 in the Egyptian Arab spring 
where I,

1022
00:44:44,190 --> 00:44:46,320
excuse me,
I think it was a CNN journalist,

1023
00:44:46,590 --> 00:44:50,530
was basically surrounded by a group of 
guys in,

1024
00:44:50,880 --> 00:44:51,713
uh,
in Cairo and then molested and forcibly 

1025
00:44:54,930 --> 00:44:58,260
be molested by gangs of men.
And this,

1026
00:44:58,320 --> 00:45:00,570
this happened on New Year's Eve all 
across Europe.

1027
00:45:00,600 --> 00:45:02,640
It happened in Stockholm,
Helsinki,

1028
00:45:02,641 --> 00:45:05,880
or attempted to in multiple German 
cities.

1029
00:45:06,210 --> 00:45:07,290
And it was,
you know,

1030
00:45:07,291 --> 00:45:07,630
the,
the,

1031
00:45:07,630 --> 00:45:12,030
the police chief literally said nothing 
like this ever happened before.

1032
00:45:12,240 --> 00:45:13,380
And so when feminists say,
well,

1033
00:45:13,381 --> 00:45:15,480
this is just men,
we know that's wrong,

1034
00:45:15,600 --> 00:45:16,060
you know,
we,

1035
00:45:16,060 --> 00:45:16,893
we know that's when we know that it is 
probably tied to retrograde attitudes 

1036
00:45:20,941 --> 00:45:23,190
towards women coming from the Islamic 
world.

1037
00:45:23,280 --> 00:45:24,113
You know,
I'm not saying every Muslim or anything 

1038
00:45:25,261 --> 00:45:26,490
like that,
but you know,

1039
00:45:26,491 --> 00:45:27,324
you,
you can't go to the Islamic world and 

1040
00:45:29,400 --> 00:45:30,233
look around and see how things are and 
say that women are treated the same 

1041
00:45:33,261 --> 00:45:34,140
there as they are here.

1042
00:45:34,220 --> 00:45:34,880
Right.
So,

1043
00:45:34,880 --> 00:45:35,713
so that's a perfect segue to this 
feminist and is video that you had 

1044
00:45:41,421 --> 00:45:42,254
mirrored.
Who was the guy that originally created 

1045
00:45:43,701 --> 00:45:44,534
the video?

1046
00:45:44,590 --> 00:45:45,423
Right.
The video was originally done by a 

1047
00:45:46,990 --> 00:45:49,420
small,
a small youtube called Seitan atheist.

1048
00:45:49,740 --> 00:45:50,573
Okay.
So He created this cartoon video and 

1049
00:45:52,381 --> 00:45:53,214
it's a song and it's basically a 
feminist and Islamist singing together 

1050
00:45:57,091 --> 00:46:01,170
about why they sort of see the world in 
the same way.

1051
00:46:01,171 --> 00:46:02,004
That was the thrust of it.
And I saw the video and before all hell 

1052
00:46:06,241 --> 00:46:09,300
broke loose about it before Richard 
Dawkins retweeted it,

1053
00:46:09,301 --> 00:46:10,134
I,
I saw it and I thought it was pretty 

1054
00:46:11,701 --> 00:46:12,534
brilliant.
It's a great satirical takedown of this 

1055
00:46:15,181 --> 00:46:17,130
regressive nonsense.
Now,

1056
00:46:17,131 --> 00:46:20,220
I didn't realize at the time that 
apparently the,

1057
00:46:20,230 --> 00:46:24,330
the female character playing the piano,
apparently that was actually based off a

1058
00:46:24,331 --> 00:46:25,350
real person.
Right?

1059
00:46:25,351 --> 00:46:26,184
I didn't know that.

1060
00:46:26,470 --> 00:46:30,090
So the Islamist,
the Islamist is a youtuber called dollar

1061
00:46:30,110 --> 00:46:31,500
man who,
um,

1062
00:46:31,680 --> 00:46:32,513
he runs around proclaiming Islamism,
united saying that everyone should 

1063
00:46:34,921 --> 00:46:36,390
bounce with Islam and all that sort of 
thing.

1064
00:46:36,391 --> 00:46:37,224
So it wasn't,
it wasn't victimizing anyone in 

1065
00:46:39,451 --> 00:46:41,640
particular in these parodies of 
individuals,

1066
00:46:41,820 --> 00:46:42,653
but the individuals who have become 
famous because of their terrible ideas 

1067
00:46:44,791 --> 00:46:45,940
and Massachusetts.
Right.

1068
00:46:47,080 --> 00:46:48,120
Go ahead.
Yeah,

1069
00:46:48,140 --> 00:46:48,691
yeah.
I mean,

1070
00:46:48,691 --> 00:46:49,524
I,
I had,

1071
00:46:49,570 --> 00:46:50,403
I,
I would love to say that I wrote it or 

1072
00:46:51,661 --> 00:46:52,530
something,
but I didn't.

1073
00:46:52,531 --> 00:46:53,980
I literally emailed the guy and said,
look,

1074
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:55,960
I really like your channel.
I want to help promote you.

1075
00:46:56,280 --> 00:46:57,113
Do me a piece of unique content that I 
can put my child wouldn't blink back to 

1076
00:47:00,121 --> 00:47:00,960
you.
Um,

1077
00:47:01,350 --> 00:47:03,540
and so you sent me this video and I saw 
it.

1078
00:47:03,630 --> 00:47:05,620
I put it up and uh,
and yeah,

1079
00:47:05,621 --> 00:47:08,280
and all hell broke loose when Richard 
Dawkins retweeted it.

1080
00:47:08,540 --> 00:47:09,373
So basically all Dawkins did was retweet
this and suddenly his twitter feed blew 

1081
00:47:14,811 --> 00:47:19,160
up and he was deep platform from a 
speaking event at the.

1082
00:47:19,161 --> 00:47:22,250
Any CSS,
I think it's the northeast conference of

1083
00:47:22,280 --> 00:47:25,610
secular skeptics,
skeptics and secularism.

1084
00:47:25,640 --> 00:47:28,220
Something close to that.
He was the platform from it.

1085
00:47:28,610 --> 00:47:31,150
They applied for them without even 
telling him.

1086
00:47:31,151 --> 00:47:34,210
There wasn't even a phone call.
They didn't ask for an explanation.

1087
00:47:34,570 --> 00:47:35,403
He then

1088
00:47:35,480 --> 00:47:37,450
he made a public statement to virtue 
signal.

1089
00:47:37,600 --> 00:47:38,850
That's the important thing.
They were telling you,

1090
00:47:38,851 --> 00:47:40,780
the regressives look,
you know,

1091
00:47:40,900 --> 00:47:44,980
with d platforming him because he has 
done something transgressive to us,

1092
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:46,390
you know,
we won't show everyone else.

1093
00:47:46,400 --> 00:47:48,160
We're on where we're at the front 
saying,

1094
00:47:48,161 --> 00:47:49,720
look,
this is a terrible thing.

1095
00:47:50,110 --> 00:47:53,350
The irony being Richard Dawkins was 
probably a big draw for that place.

1096
00:47:53,351 --> 00:47:54,250
You know what I mean?
Of course,

1097
00:47:54,680 --> 00:47:55,513
you know,
he,

1098
00:47:55,870 --> 00:47:56,703
they might get three,
400 people that Richard Dawkins has 

1099
00:47:58,841 --> 00:48:00,550
millions of followers,
you know,

1100
00:48:00,780 --> 00:48:01,480
he,
he's,

1101
00:48:01,480 --> 00:48:03,430
he's doing them a favor.
So the,

1102
00:48:03,680 --> 00:48:04,540
you know,
they haven't,

1103
00:48:05,260 --> 00:48:06,093
they,
they've kind of shot themselves in the 

1104
00:48:06,581 --> 00:48:07,414
foot and they've just made themselves 
with really intolerant because his 

1105
00:48:08,981 --> 00:48:12,130
original tweet was obviously as a 
feminist myself,

1106
00:48:12,160 --> 00:48:12,993
this doesn't apply to all feminists,
but there is definitely a pernicious 

1107
00:48:14,591 --> 00:48:19,210
minority and low and behold the punishes
minority rose up and you know,

1108
00:48:19,240 --> 00:48:20,380
got in his face and it's like,
okay,

1109
00:48:20,381 --> 00:48:22,240
well you're just proving the point of 
the video.

1110
00:48:22,480 --> 00:48:24,920
Right?
So you're literally proving the point of

1111
00:48:24,921 --> 00:48:25,754
the video.
You're literally proving that these two 

1112
00:48:28,701 --> 00:48:33,701
groups for all the wrong reasons have 
become partners.

1113
00:48:34,460 --> 00:48:35,293
That there's one ideology that,
that feminist unfortunately or some 

1114
00:48:39,291 --> 00:48:44,291
degree of feminist seem to be okay with.
And it's the same ideology that would do

1115
00:48:44,720 --> 00:48:47,180
the worst to women.
Yes.

1116
00:48:47,360 --> 00:48:48,790
It's hard to.
It's hard to believe that we,

1117
00:48:48,950 --> 00:48:51,710
even as I'm saying it,
I'm thinking this is completely bonkers.

1118
00:48:51,950 --> 00:48:53,840
It is absolutely.
It's bunk.

1119
00:48:53,900 --> 00:48:56,530
I'm without intersection Islam.
It doesn't make any sense at all,

1120
00:48:56,630 --> 00:48:57,680
you know.
But when,

1121
00:48:57,850 --> 00:48:59,340
again,
you've got to thinking sexually,

1122
00:48:59,360 --> 00:49:02,760
so you think Ryan white person than 
Brown person than men,

1123
00:49:02,840 --> 00:49:03,980
women and said,
okay,

1124
00:49:04,630 --> 00:49:07,660
what the question is,
what is the most oppressive thing,

1125
00:49:07,900 --> 00:49:10,720
so I'm am oppressed in the woman that's 
quite bad,

1126
00:49:10,930 --> 00:49:11,763
but a white person,
the pressing a brown person that's much 

1127
00:49:13,661 --> 00:49:14,494
worse and therefore now we're talking 
about a bunch of Brown people being 

1128
00:49:18,100 --> 00:49:18,933
oppressed by a bunch of white people,
and so the fact that men and women are 

1129
00:49:21,821 --> 00:49:23,920
oppressing each other brown winter or 
pressing white women,

1130
00:49:24,040 --> 00:49:24,873
that's so important.
The important bit is the skin color 

1131
00:49:26,891 --> 00:49:27,724
above the sex,
which I'm genuinely surprised that I 

1132
00:49:29,771 --> 00:49:30,604
thought feminist would go the other way.
I thought that they would be more 

1133
00:49:32,681 --> 00:49:34,570
concerned about men oppressing women in 
Lynn Brown.

1134
00:49:34,571 --> 00:49:36,280
People are being oppressed by white 
people,

1135
00:49:36,460 --> 00:49:37,293
but apparently the.
No.

1136
00:49:37,330 --> 00:49:38,320
Yeah,
apparently not.

1137
00:49:38,321 --> 00:49:39,154
So in your estimation then,
knowing the way the feminist movement 

1138
00:49:42,130 --> 00:49:42,963
has evolved,
and obviously I've had Christina Hoff 

1139
00:49:44,201 --> 00:49:47,080
summers on the show and I've talked to 
her about some of this stuff.

1140
00:49:47,140 --> 00:49:47,973
What would you say is the best?
If you just want true equality for the 

1141
00:49:51,971 --> 00:49:54,190
sexes,
you're married to a woman,

1142
00:49:54,191 --> 00:49:55,330
you,
you like women,

1143
00:49:56,580 --> 00:49:58,750
heterosexual guy that likes women,
right?

1144
00:49:59,020 --> 00:49:59,853
Um,
what would you say is the best way for 

1145
00:50:02,861 --> 00:50:05,650
men and for women,
for anyone that cares about the ideas of

1146
00:50:05,651 --> 00:50:07,870
feminism to go out and act on those 
ideas?

1147
00:50:08,930 --> 00:50:10,580
Um,
I mean,

1148
00:50:10,880 --> 00:50:11,713
honestly,
I think one of the problems that 

1149
00:50:12,921 --> 00:50:14,740
feminism has now,
modern feminism has,

1150
00:50:14,930 --> 00:50:17,300
this is one of dragons to slay,
you know,

1151
00:50:17,330 --> 00:50:18,163
I mean men,
men and women have complete legal 

1152
00:50:19,641 --> 00:50:21,590
equality.
I can't think of it whenever,

1153
00:50:21,620 --> 00:50:23,540
whenever a feminist is challenging you 
to say,

1154
00:50:23,541 --> 00:50:23,961
Oh,
you know,

1155
00:50:23,961 --> 00:50:27,800
the men are oppressing women.
Ask them what legal men have.

1156
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:29,610
Women,
they can't leave it.

1157
00:50:29,660 --> 00:50:32,840
There just aren't any.
And so we're at the point now where,

1158
00:50:33,320 --> 00:50:34,360
I mean,
I,

1159
00:50:34,361 --> 00:50:35,194
I don't know what more needs to be done.
We seem to be living in quite stable 

1160
00:50:38,451 --> 00:50:39,284
liberal democracies where merit methods.
I mean obviously in everything it is a 

1161
00:50:44,301 --> 00:50:45,710
lot of,
a lot of what it is is who,

1162
00:50:45,711 --> 00:50:46,670
you know rather than what,
you know,

1163
00:50:46,730 --> 00:50:48,050
Butts,
merit,

1164
00:50:48,110 --> 00:50:49,330
still massive,
you know,

1165
00:50:49,340 --> 00:50:50,173
you can't just hire someone for that 
arbitrary characteristics if they can't 

1166
00:50:53,960 --> 00:50:54,980
do the job,
but you mean no one,

1167
00:50:55,160 --> 00:50:55,850
no one thinks that.

1168
00:50:55,850 --> 00:50:58,460
So,
I mean I'm personally,

1169
00:50:58,461 --> 00:50:59,294
I just think don't,
don't make judgments based on racial 

1170
00:51:01,341 --> 00:51:04,790
gender or you know,
or transgenderism or you know,

1171
00:51:04,890 --> 00:51:06,800
or homosexuality or anything like that.
The,

1172
00:51:06,930 --> 00:51:10,880
these characteristics that Germany,
I'm very useful to judge people on.

1173
00:51:10,881 --> 00:51:11,860
I mean,
you know,

1174
00:51:11,861 --> 00:51:12,694
your,
your being a white man doesn't in any 

1175
00:51:14,421 --> 00:51:17,090
way inform how good an inferior you are.
You know,

1176
00:51:17,091 --> 00:51:17,910
I,
I'm,

1177
00:51:17,910 --> 00:51:19,640
I'm not watching you because you're a 
white man.

1178
00:51:19,641 --> 00:51:20,474
I'm watching you because I like the 
guests you have on what the questions 

1179
00:51:23,481 --> 00:51:25,280
you asked.
I let the ounces you get out with them.

1180
00:51:25,590 --> 00:51:27,680
You know,
none of that has anything to do with you

1181
00:51:27,681 --> 00:51:29,060
being white or male.
A straight.

1182
00:51:29,070 --> 00:51:30,050
Okay.
Or anything about this.

1183
00:51:30,190 --> 00:51:31,023
They,
they completely pointless and arbitrary 

1184
00:51:32,781 --> 00:51:34,370
characteristics that really apply.

1185
00:51:34,450 --> 00:51:37,330
Right?
So really all we have to do is just keep

1186
00:51:37,331 --> 00:51:38,770
hammering the point home,
right?

1187
00:51:38,771 --> 00:51:43,771
If if were for people that want to 
remove this identity politics stuff,

1188
00:51:44,140 --> 00:51:44,973
we just have to keep hammering that 
until it becomes so obvious and I do 

1189
00:51:48,251 --> 00:51:49,084
think that's where,
and this is where we can sort of pivot 

1190
00:51:51,100 --> 00:51:53,020
to a little more of the regressive 
tactics.

1191
00:51:53,260 --> 00:51:54,093
This is where we can really beat them.
They're tough to beat because we know 

1192
00:51:57,101 --> 00:51:57,934
they're going to lie.
We know they're gonna cheat and 

1193
00:51:59,561 --> 00:52:01,810
misinformed people and all of those 
things,

1194
00:52:02,380 --> 00:52:03,213
but what we can keep hammering them with
is we want equality for everybody 

1195
00:52:07,061 --> 00:52:11,200
regardless of borders and nationality 
and religion and everything else.

1196
00:52:11,580 --> 00:52:12,001
Yeah.
The,

1197
00:52:12,001 --> 00:52:12,834
the,
the fundamentals of the fundamental 

1198
00:52:14,221 --> 00:52:17,170
principles of liberalism,
a universal mats that,

1199
00:52:17,190 --> 00:52:18,023
that was the great.
The great gift of sort of English 

1200
00:52:20,491 --> 00:52:21,324
liberalism is individual rights and 
universal principles that you think are 

1201
00:52:25,281 --> 00:52:25,681
wrong.
You know,

1202
00:52:25,681 --> 00:52:28,830
we've not always applied these evenly or
anything like this.

1203
00:52:29,370 --> 00:52:30,203
And you know,
initially they were exclusively for 

1204
00:52:32,191 --> 00:52:34,530
white heterosexual men at the very top 
of the pyramid.

1205
00:52:35,040 --> 00:52:35,873
But the point is that the principals 
obviously lend themselves to cascading 

1206
00:52:39,421 --> 00:52:40,254
downwards because as soon as you have 
some people who are espousing these 

1207
00:52:42,811 --> 00:52:43,644
principles,
there is no good reason not to extend 

1208
00:52:45,151 --> 00:52:45,984
the franchise to everyone,
which is why we now have universal 

1209
00:52:48,301 --> 00:52:50,380
suffrage.
It Yukon.

1210
00:52:50,580 --> 00:52:55,080
There's no justification to not united.
The on all of the justification is given

1211
00:52:55,120 --> 00:52:56,330
world,
obviously faulting,

1212
00:52:56,331 --> 00:52:57,690
which is why we're now at the point 
where we are.

1213
00:52:58,280 --> 00:52:59,670
Um,
so yeah,

1214
00:52:59,671 --> 00:53:02,400
it just basically stay true to your own 
principles.

1215
00:53:02,670 --> 00:53:04,560
If you think it's wrong to judge by 
race,

1216
00:53:04,710 --> 00:53:07,290
don't judge people by race.
It doesn't matter what race they are.

1217
00:53:07,530 --> 00:53:09,060
If you think it's wrong to judge by 
people,

1218
00:53:09,061 --> 00:53:10,900
by sex,
don't judge people by sex,

1219
00:53:11,010 --> 00:53:11,510
you know.
And,

1220
00:53:11,510 --> 00:53:12,810
and the,
all,

1221
00:53:12,811 --> 00:53:14,970
I,
all I can say is that these are timeless

1222
00:53:14,971 --> 00:53:17,930
principles that will always be relevant.
You know,

1223
00:53:18,030 --> 00:53:20,280
they will never be a time where someone 
says,

1224
00:53:20,281 --> 00:53:22,020
you know,
actually it is because I'm black,

1225
00:53:22,021 --> 00:53:24,990
that I should be judged is because I'm a
woman that I should be.

1226
00:53:25,710 --> 00:53:26,543
And it's only because these people have,
they've got a lot of good and very 

1227
00:53:30,601 --> 00:53:33,840
slippery language and techniques to 
persuade people that in fact,

1228
00:53:34,080 --> 00:53:35,670
you know,
given this context,

1229
00:53:35,700 --> 00:53:38,850
it's right to do this.
Whereas I'm of the opinion that there is

1230
00:53:38,851 --> 00:53:39,684
no context in which its rights to judge 
people based on characteristics they 

1231
00:53:42,511 --> 00:53:45,510
have no control over if you didn't get 
to choose it.

1232
00:53:45,690 --> 00:53:49,170
It's not a part of your character,
it doesn't describe you as a person,

1233
00:53:49,410 --> 00:53:51,230
it just describes your body or your,
you know,

1234
00:53:51,231 --> 00:53:55,320
your physical characteristics.
It doesn't describe what you are like in

1235
00:53:55,321 --> 00:53:56,000
your character.

1236
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:56,833
So does this,
do you think this also goes to the 

1237
00:53:58,071 --> 00:54:00,920
feeling part of this?
Because that's sort of what I'm thinking

1238
00:54:00,921 --> 00:54:02,290
as you're saying this,
that there is,

1239
00:54:02,480 --> 00:54:07,480
there is a feeling that I think this 
regressive ideology is attached to.

1240
00:54:07,701 --> 00:54:10,580
So for example,
I can't give you a,

1241
00:54:10,581 --> 00:54:11,414
as you just said,
I can't give you an example of where 

1242
00:54:13,701 --> 00:54:17,060
systemically in the United States that 
women are oppressed,

1243
00:54:17,061 --> 00:54:18,270
meaning that,
you know,

1244
00:54:18,290 --> 00:54:19,850
there are now laws protecting,
you know,

1245
00:54:19,851 --> 00:54:21,650
equal opportunity laws and things like 
that.

1246
00:54:21,950 --> 00:54:22,783
Now that doesn't mean that women don't 
have a harder time related to certain 

1247
00:54:26,181 --> 00:54:27,740
things.
If business deals,

1248
00:54:27,890 --> 00:54:28,723
for example,
are being done on golf courses and less 

1249
00:54:30,441 --> 00:54:31,274
women play golf,
well then they're going to be excluded 

1250
00:54:34,250 --> 00:54:35,720
and then you could probably think of 
many,

1251
00:54:35,810 --> 00:54:39,380
many examples like that.
But what that is really more about is,

1252
00:54:39,440 --> 00:54:43,490
is a feeling not sort of a systemic 
legal issue.

1253
00:54:43,491 --> 00:54:47,240
And I think that's where people,
that's where people struggle to separate

1254
00:54:47,241 --> 00:54:48,074
these things.

1255
00:54:48,260 --> 00:54:48,861
Yeah,
absolutely.

1256
00:54:48,861 --> 00:54:50,390
I mean,
I think like,

1257
00:54:50,391 --> 00:54:52,070
um,
uh,

1258
00:54:52,071 --> 00:54:52,904
what's the,
what's the company that does the sex 

1259
00:54:54,471 --> 00:54:59,000
toys and some.
And some of this is a British company.

1260
00:54:59,001 --> 00:55:00,950
I think it,
it sounds sex toys.

1261
00:55:01,200 --> 00:55:02,033
It's,
it was created by a woman and a large 

1262
00:55:04,251 --> 00:55:05,084
portion of the company is run by women.
They probably don't do that business 

1263
00:55:07,701 --> 00:55:09,260
deals on golf courses,
you know,

1264
00:55:09,261 --> 00:55:10,190
they,
they probably have,

1265
00:55:10,191 --> 00:55:12,560
I don't know,
mass on nail salons or something like,

1266
00:55:12,740 --> 00:55:13,170
so,
you know,

1267
00:55:13,170 --> 00:55:16,820
and I'm saying stereotypical,
but they don't go to the golf courses.

1268
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:17,833
So I would have to change my position 
and perspective and I would have to go 

1269
00:55:21,081 --> 00:55:25,110
to where the power is in that situation.
You're right.

1270
00:55:25,120 --> 00:55:26,210
And you know,
they're,

1271
00:55:26,220 --> 00:55:29,180
they're all going to be cases where you 
have um,

1272
00:55:30,070 --> 00:55:32,840
you know,
powerful ceos who go golfing and the way

1273
00:55:32,841 --> 00:55:36,710
to get into the good graces would be to 
go go from as well.

1274
00:55:37,010 --> 00:55:38,330
Um,
you know,

1275
00:55:38,510 --> 00:55:40,670
sometimes you've got to make sacrifices.
I,

1276
00:55:41,020 --> 00:55:41,853
I personally hate golfing,
but I wanted to be the CEO of this 

1277
00:55:44,571 --> 00:55:45,470
company will get,
you know,

1278
00:55:45,510 --> 00:55:48,050
I went to work my way up the ladder.
I would take up golfing.

1279
00:55:48,051 --> 00:55:49,250
You know,
it doesn't matter about your gender,

1280
00:55:49,251 --> 00:55:50,960
it matters about how well you'd go,
you know.

1281
00:55:51,240 --> 00:55:52,810
So,
you know,

1282
00:55:52,811 --> 00:55:53,430
I,
I,

1283
00:55:53,430 --> 00:55:54,950
like I said,
it's not a perfect system either,

1284
00:55:54,951 --> 00:55:55,784
but it's better than the alternative 
because one thing that people were out 

1285
00:55:58,590 --> 00:55:59,423
of my quotes is as soon as you start 
discriminating in favor of someone 

1286
00:56:02,420 --> 00:56:04,340
because of skin color,
sex,

1287
00:56:04,341 --> 00:56:05,174
ethnicity,
whatever,

1288
00:56:05,600 --> 00:56:09,680
you will also discriminating against 
people on those very same categories.

1289
00:56:09,840 --> 00:56:10,880
You know,
if you say,

1290
00:56:10,881 --> 00:56:12,320
right,
we've got a position here and we need to

1291
00:56:12,321 --> 00:56:13,154
hire a black woman,
then you're excluding people on the 

1292
00:56:15,201 --> 00:56:17,310
basis of their race and sex.
So I,

1293
00:56:17,360 --> 00:56:18,470
I can't agree with that.

1294
00:56:18,470 --> 00:56:19,303
I think that's wrong.
If I'm sure there are plenty of 

1295
00:56:22,550 --> 00:56:24,130
incredibly talented black women out 
there,

1296
00:56:24,131 --> 00:56:28,350
therefore we don't need to make 
artificial adjustments.

1297
00:56:28,360 --> 00:56:29,410
Surely,
you know,

1298
00:56:29,411 --> 00:56:32,650
and at the end of the day,
if we go down this road,

1299
00:56:32,710 --> 00:56:34,990
then when does it end?
Where,

1300
00:56:35,010 --> 00:56:35,843
where is the eventual logical goal?
Eventually you come to a planned 

1301
00:56:37,961 --> 00:56:39,610
economy.
What you can't,

1302
00:56:39,940 --> 00:56:41,500
you can't just have honor.
We,

1303
00:56:41,760 --> 00:56:42,593
you were going to hire by merit,
but now you've got 10 different 

1304
00:56:45,701 --> 00:56:47,410
categories you've got to go through,
you know,

1305
00:56:47,440 --> 00:56:48,460
how many,
how many trans people,

1306
00:56:48,780 --> 00:56:49,930
Queer people,
how many black,

1307
00:56:49,931 --> 00:56:50,764
white,
Hispanic,

1308
00:56:50,880 --> 00:56:53,080
you know.
And so now you're talking about how good

1309
00:56:53,081 --> 00:56:53,914
they are at their jobs.
Now you're talking about the just 

1310
00:56:55,360 --> 00:56:57,130
operatory characteristics of these 
people.

1311
00:56:57,580 --> 00:57:00,190
And what happens when,
like if three people leave,

1312
00:57:00,191 --> 00:57:01,024
once you do three black people,
leave your company and all you have 

1313
00:57:03,100 --> 00:57:03,911
applying for jobs,
uh,

1314
00:57:03,911 --> 00:57:04,750
white people,
what do you,

1315
00:57:04,751 --> 00:57:05,720
do?
You know,

1316
00:57:06,370 --> 00:57:07,930
you're in a position where it's,
it's ridiculous.

1317
00:57:08,070 --> 00:57:09,000
Yeah,
it's really crazy.

1318
00:57:09,001 --> 00:57:09,834
It's almost like the,
the quest for equality is being played 

1319
00:57:13,770 --> 00:57:18,770
sort of on an unequal playing field and 
that just makes everybody kind of nuts.

1320
00:57:19,170 --> 00:57:19,710
Well,
I think,

1321
00:57:19,710 --> 00:57:21,900
I think nature really didn't have it 
right when he,

1322
00:57:21,930 --> 00:57:23,160
when he was saying that,
um,

1323
00:57:23,730 --> 00:57:26,040
you know,
be careful when you're battling monsters

1324
00:57:26,041 --> 00:57:27,900
because when you stand along into the 
abyss,

1325
00:57:28,080 --> 00:57:30,110
the bissell sustains into you.
You're not.

1326
00:57:30,111 --> 00:57:30,944
And if you,
if you stand along into the sort of 

1327
00:57:33,030 --> 00:57:36,060
progressive mindset of the world is 
terribly uneven,

1328
00:57:36,061 --> 00:57:38,130
it's an unequal.
There are no opportunities for anyone.

1329
00:57:38,190 --> 00:57:39,023
There's no ed.
We need to do anything we can to help 

1330
00:57:41,251 --> 00:57:43,530
them.
Then everything becomes justified.

1331
00:57:43,560 --> 00:57:43,960
You know,
the,

1332
00:57:43,960 --> 00:57:44,420
the,
the,

1333
00:57:44,420 --> 00:57:45,870
it doesn't matter whose rights you're 
trump alone,

1334
00:57:46,140 --> 00:57:48,930
you're doing it for the greater good.
And that's what really scared.

1335
00:57:49,510 --> 00:57:50,343
So that's actually a great segue to.
I want to talk about a little bit about 

1336
00:57:52,871 --> 00:57:54,630
their tactics.
So I think in the,

1337
00:57:54,890 --> 00:57:56,770
in the 45 minutes or so that we've been 
talking,

1338
00:57:56,771 --> 00:58:00,760
we've talked a lot about their ideas and
obviously we're not fans of their ideas,

1339
00:58:00,970 --> 00:58:01,803
but I think there's something more 
pernicious going on here with some of 

1340
00:58:04,511 --> 00:58:05,344
the tactics because I don't think it's a
coincidence that many of the main 

1341
00:58:08,831 --> 00:58:11,380
players in this regressive left 
movement,

1342
00:58:11,680 --> 00:58:14,620
uh,
have been exposed to be liars,

1343
00:58:14,650 --> 00:58:17,470
to be plagiarists,
to be frauds,

1344
00:58:17,650 --> 00:58:18,483
to purposely manipulate people's words,
to create memes that are knowingly 

1345
00:58:24,551 --> 00:58:27,670
misquoted all of these things.
I don't think that's a coincidence.

1346
00:58:27,671 --> 00:58:32,200
Now you may disagree what with what 
Sargon of Akkad says,

1347
00:58:32,201 --> 00:58:33,034
or what Dave Rubin says,
but I don't think you would find 

1348
00:58:35,471 --> 00:58:38,800
instances where we maliciously 
misrepresented people.

1349
00:58:39,190 --> 00:58:43,600
And I suppose they're just their 
argument if you really got them alone,

1350
00:58:43,601 --> 00:58:45,490
if you could really get an honest moment
out of them,

1351
00:58:45,640 --> 00:58:48,820
which I don't know you could get,
but I suppose their argument would be,

1352
00:58:48,821 --> 00:58:49,654
well,
the ends justify the means and that's 

1353
00:58:51,131 --> 00:58:53,080
just the reverse of how I view the 
world.

1354
00:58:53,950 --> 00:58:54,420
Yeah,
no,

1355
00:58:54,420 --> 00:58:56,580
that is honest.
Honestly,

1356
00:58:56,581 --> 00:58:57,630
that's exactly what it is,
right?

1357
00:58:57,631 --> 00:59:00,040
It's about it.
They're the,

1358
00:59:00,300 --> 00:59:05,300
there's a lot to unpack here actually.
There's these people are being primed in

1359
00:59:05,431 --> 00:59:06,264
universities to be activists and part of
the priming is to give them a good 

1360
00:59:10,590 --> 00:59:12,900
feeling about doing this activism.
You know,

1361
00:59:13,140 --> 00:59:18,060
it's to make them think that they can 
emotionally reward themselves by saying,

1362
00:59:18,070 --> 00:59:20,430
yeah,
I argued with a misogynist on twitter,

1363
00:59:20,650 --> 00:59:21,483
you know,
for,

1364
00:59:22,940 --> 00:59:24,080
oh no,
I'm not kidding there.

1365
00:59:24,081 --> 00:59:25,910
That genuinely is.
I've seen feminist,

1366
00:59:25,911 --> 00:59:28,610
I've seen pictures of feminists courses 
were on the wall.

1367
00:59:28,611 --> 00:59:29,444
They have a big twitter activism is 
feminism and stuff like this and it's 

1368
00:59:32,631 --> 00:59:33,830
just like,
really?

1369
00:59:34,270 --> 00:59:37,100
That's the thing.
They're encouraged to be activists.

1370
00:59:37,101 --> 00:59:37,934
They are encouraged to emotion and 
reward themselves for being activists 

1371
00:59:40,510 --> 00:59:40,880
and stuff.

1372
00:59:40,880 --> 00:59:43,250
Do you know like theory about never 
argued with a twitter egg.

1373
00:59:43,400 --> 00:59:45,500
That's what I'm going to put on my 
tombstone one day.

1374
00:59:47,110 --> 00:59:48,170
I,
I haven't heard that,

1375
00:59:48,240 --> 00:59:49,480
but that's a good one because I,
I,

1376
00:59:50,100 --> 00:59:50,933
I,
I care about ideas and not like people 

1377
00:59:52,351 --> 00:59:53,184
are numbers so I can't wait when someone
would like five fullest as your role in 

1378
00:59:56,531 --> 00:59:57,840
this.
I've got to argue the case.

1379
00:59:58,930 --> 01:00:00,600
I've got to stop out.
Wow.

1380
01:00:00,601 --> 01:00:02,130
I might be a little more evolved than 
you.

1381
01:00:02,131 --> 01:00:04,590
That's pretty good.
Um,

1382
01:00:04,800 --> 01:00:06,480
what was I saying?
Um,

1383
01:00:06,650 --> 01:00:07,620
that at the schools that,
there,

1384
01:00:07,621 --> 01:00:08,454
there's this,
there's an intellectual incentive or 

1385
01:00:10,191 --> 01:00:11,360
there's a feeling incentive.

1386
01:00:11,390 --> 01:00:13,890
Yeah,
there's an emotional incentive and um,

1387
01:00:14,320 --> 01:00:15,153
basically it's,
they've got to the point where they've 

1388
01:00:15,911 --> 01:00:16,744
convinced themselves that progressive or
regressive ism is the only morally 

1389
01:00:21,551 --> 01:00:22,384
legitimate position to hold.
And so anyone not holding this position 

1390
01:00:26,350 --> 01:00:27,183
must be a bad person.
And that's everything about 

1391
01:00:29,560 --> 01:00:33,340
progressivism in a nutshell right there.
If you a regressive,

1392
01:00:33,390 --> 01:00:34,223
you are a bad person.
If you owns sacrificing other people's 

1393
01:00:37,031 --> 01:00:37,864
rights for the rights of a group that 
you don't know you've got no connection 

1394
01:00:41,081 --> 01:00:41,914
to,
but you have been emotionally primed to 

1395
01:00:43,661 --> 01:00:46,240
fight for,
then you're a bad person.

1396
01:00:46,241 --> 01:00:49,380
And so it's okay for me to call you all 
these terrible labels.

1397
01:00:49,381 --> 01:00:50,214
I mean,
I,

1398
01:00:50,480 --> 01:00:54,070
you would have to be pretty damn racist 
for me to call you a racist,

1399
01:00:54,071 --> 01:00:55,600
you know,
it's a bad label.

1400
01:00:56,090 --> 01:00:56,923
It's a label with a lot of weight and 
yet these people throw around as if it 

1401
01:00:59,471 --> 01:01:00,520
means nothing.
You know?

1402
01:01:00,820 --> 01:01:01,411
You know,
I,

1403
01:01:01,411 --> 01:01:03,760
I always say that I,
I think I said this to you when I was on

1404
01:01:03,761 --> 01:01:07,120
your show that my awakening had a lot to
do with that whole Ben Affleck,

1405
01:01:07,121 --> 01:01:07,954
Sam Harris thing on real time and,
and part of what the craziness of was 

1406
01:01:11,470 --> 01:01:12,303
with that was that ben throughout 
racists so quickly that I agree with 

1407
01:01:16,811 --> 01:01:17,950
you,
it would take a lot.

1408
01:01:17,980 --> 01:01:18,813
It would take a lot.
There are obvious racist out there and 

1409
01:01:21,011 --> 01:01:23,560
they should be called out,
but if you were arguing with someone,

1410
01:01:23,561 --> 01:01:27,910
it would take a real special person for 
them to eliminate that.

1411
01:01:27,911 --> 01:01:30,040
They were racist within 30 seconds.

1412
01:01:30,590 --> 01:01:31,423
I mean,
yeah,

1413
01:01:31,870 --> 01:01:32,703
I can only imagine.
Then that came straight out of the gate 

1414
01:01:34,131 --> 01:01:35,530
with it or something and they were like,
yeah,

1415
01:01:35,531 --> 01:01:37,080
okay.
Black people should be under,

1416
01:01:37,240 --> 01:01:38,890
shipped off the cotton plantations or 
something.

1417
01:01:38,910 --> 01:01:39,231
Be like,
okay,

1418
01:01:39,231 --> 01:01:40,970
well you're a racist.
And on the blood,

1419
01:01:40,971 --> 01:01:42,580
well I wouldn't call myself and 
whatever,

1420
01:01:42,890 --> 01:01:47,180
but some of these things normally hold a
lot of weights and the.

1421
01:01:47,840 --> 01:01:48,673
And that's the reason they use.
They use labels as weapons and they did 

1422
01:01:50,751 --> 01:01:52,580
it for a reason,
for a couple of reasons.

1423
01:01:52,581 --> 01:01:54,050
Actually.
The first one obviously is to put you on

1424
01:01:54,051 --> 01:01:54,884
the back foot.
As soon as you're called a racist or 

1425
01:01:56,391 --> 01:02:00,050
homophobic or bigger or whatever.
Then you're defending yourself.

1426
01:02:00,051 --> 01:02:02,630
You're not defending your ideas.
You're not attacking their ideas.

1427
01:02:02,810 --> 01:02:04,310
You're defending yourself as a person.
I mean,

1428
01:02:04,440 --> 01:02:05,273
that's in itself a logical fallacy 
called an ad hominem attack the person 

1429
01:02:08,091 --> 01:02:08,924
rather than the ideas,
and you will find that they do this a 

1430
01:02:10,851 --> 01:02:11,630
lot.

1431
01:02:11,630 --> 01:02:12,710
So basically,
right?

1432
01:02:12,711 --> 01:02:17,711
The answer to this is to just say in 
your opinion on the end of it,

1433
01:02:17,780 --> 01:02:19,170
so they'll say you're a racist and you 
say,

1434
01:02:19,171 --> 01:02:20,130
well,
in your opinion,

1435
01:02:20,400 --> 01:02:21,720
right?
But they'll say,

1436
01:02:21,721 --> 01:02:23,390
you know,
you're a racist or sexist or bigoted.

1437
01:02:23,400 --> 01:02:24,840
So in your opinion,
you know,

1438
01:02:25,140 --> 01:02:29,640
I'm not lots and I know him and nothing 
that I've said would make any reasonable

1439
01:02:29,940 --> 01:02:30,773
person thing,
but you other nodal reasonable person 

1440
01:02:33,840 --> 01:02:36,120
and therefore you're going to label me 
as a racist or a bigot or whatever.

1441
01:02:36,480 --> 01:02:38,520
And honestly what you've just given me 
is your opinion.

1442
01:02:38,521 --> 01:02:39,354
It's not an objective statement of fact.
It's like when they use the word 

1443
01:02:40,801 --> 01:02:42,630
programmatic,
they'll say,

1444
01:02:42,900 --> 01:02:43,960
oh,
that's problematic.

1445
01:02:43,961 --> 01:02:44,794
And like,
well,

1446
01:02:44,820 --> 01:02:46,450
can you explain to me what programmatic 
means?

1447
01:02:46,910 --> 01:02:48,930
Immoral.
Does it mean wrong?

1448
01:02:48,931 --> 01:02:50,140
Doesn't mean illegal?
No.

1449
01:02:50,370 --> 01:02:51,203
It means transgressive to progressivism 
with feminism and it's basically the 

1450
01:02:55,201 --> 01:02:59,700
same as sinful in the Catholic church or
it's the same as in Islam,

1451
01:02:59,701 --> 01:03:00,410
you know,
it's,

1452
01:03:00,410 --> 01:03:01,243
it's the,
this is transgressive to my ideology is 

1453
01:03:04,540 --> 01:03:06,630
something wrong and it's not an 
objective statement of fact.

1454
01:03:06,660 --> 01:03:09,210
It's,
I don't like what you've done.

1455
01:03:09,510 --> 01:03:10,360
Right.
So that I,

1456
01:03:10,410 --> 01:03:11,243
I love that because it goes to show that
they want in a certain intellectual or 

1457
01:03:14,971 --> 01:03:15,804
ideological purity and that's what the 
Church would want out of your or any 

1458
01:03:19,591 --> 01:03:24,040
sort of authoritarian view would want an
intellectual and ideological peer,

1459
01:03:24,060 --> 01:03:26,340
not intellectual,
purely ideological purity.

1460
01:03:26,341 --> 01:03:27,880
It's usually not that intellectual,
right?

1461
01:03:28,100 --> 01:03:28,710
No,
absolutely.

1462
01:03:28,710 --> 01:03:31,620
They want an ideological ideological 
purity out of you.

1463
01:03:31,890 --> 01:03:33,210
And what that does,
you know,

1464
01:03:33,211 --> 01:03:34,044
I'm seeing this right now in our 
democratic debate last week between 

1465
01:03:37,140 --> 01:03:37,973
Bernie and Hillary.
They were arguing over who's the bigger 

1466
01:03:39,421 --> 01:03:41,310
progressive and it's like,
guys,

1467
01:03:41,370 --> 01:03:43,230
that's not what the fight should be 
about.

1468
01:03:43,231 --> 01:03:45,090
It should be about,
if you're on the left,

1469
01:03:45,091 --> 01:03:48,120
it should be about who is standing up 
for liberal principles,

1470
01:03:48,121 --> 01:03:48,954
more,
not who fits this narrow definition 

1471
01:03:50,911 --> 01:03:51,744
because guess what then all you do,
as we've said a zillion times in your 

1472
01:03:54,091 --> 01:03:56,220
hand,
the debate over to the right and

1473
01:03:56,710 --> 01:03:58,150
absolutely,
and yet Donald Trump,

1474
01:03:58,620 --> 01:04:01,000
the steering in their own juices there 
as well.

1475
01:04:01,001 --> 01:04:02,320
He's,
I know I'm the biggest procrastinator.

1476
01:04:02,321 --> 01:04:04,300
Salute you.
You don't need to.

1477
01:04:04,390 --> 01:04:05,223
You don't need to worry about convincing
people about who's the bigger 

1478
01:04:06,840 --> 01:04:09,330
progressive progressive's aren't going 
to vote for you.

1479
01:04:09,390 --> 01:04:10,223
You know,
liberals are the people you want to 

1480
01:04:11,471 --> 01:04:13,650
commence on the swing.
Voters who are dying,

1481
01:04:13,870 --> 01:04:14,703
you know,
died in the more progressive than the 

1482
01:04:15,701 --> 01:04:16,800
people who,
you know,

1483
01:04:16,870 --> 01:04:18,160
who,
who concerned about issues.

1484
01:04:18,161 --> 01:04:19,390
Okay.
Said about policies,

1485
01:04:19,560 --> 01:04:20,393
you know,
who can send about what you're actually 

1486
01:04:20,891 --> 01:04:22,250
going to do rather than,
you know,

1487
01:04:22,450 --> 01:04:25,470
ideological Brownie points.
And so yeah,

1488
01:04:25,480 --> 01:04:27,160
it's,
it's just this little circle jerk with a

1489
01:04:27,400 --> 01:04:28,233
student or an ideology for so long.
They don't understand how they're being 

1490
01:04:31,391 --> 01:04:32,224
viewed from the outside.
I let you said it's driving people to 

1491
01:04:33,671 --> 01:04:34,504
the right.
You know,

1492
01:04:34,750 --> 01:04:35,950
it's absolutely driving people.

1493
01:04:35,950 --> 01:04:38,170
So then what,
what do we do?

1494
01:04:38,230 --> 01:04:40,330
Because that is not us,
right?

1495
01:04:40,331 --> 01:04:43,240
We're the ones,
we're the ones that are trying to defend

1496
01:04:43,241 --> 01:04:44,074
classical liberalism.
I'm sure you get tons of emails and 

1497
01:04:47,021 --> 01:04:49,900
tweets and all that stuff that I get all
the time about.

1498
01:04:49,901 --> 01:04:52,360
I see this split,
this has happened.

1499
01:04:52,720 --> 01:04:53,553
I get people telling me they're afraid 
and embarrassed to call themselves on 

1500
01:04:56,231 --> 01:04:57,064
the left.
I get other people saying they won't 

1501
01:04:58,271 --> 01:05:01,300
post things on facebook because they 
don't want to get called a racist.

1502
01:05:01,301 --> 01:05:02,134
So all of these things.
So if there's this growing group of 

1503
01:05:03,911 --> 01:05:05,350
people,
which there absolutely is,

1504
01:05:05,351 --> 01:05:07,450
I have no doubt about it.
Uh,

1505
01:05:08,200 --> 01:05:09,033
what,
what do we do to keep this message 

1506
01:05:10,421 --> 01:05:11,254
going?

1507
01:05:11,580 --> 01:05:12,420
Okay.
Um,

1508
01:05:12,630 --> 01:05:13,463
okay.
So the great thing about what's 

1509
01:05:14,521 --> 01:05:18,670
happening is that the,
it's interesting because,

1510
01:05:18,760 --> 01:05:19,870
I mean,
like I said,

1511
01:05:19,871 --> 01:05:21,880
you had Milo Yiannopoulos on your show.
He was a,

1512
01:05:22,210 --> 01:05:25,090
he was the only journalist who was 
prepared to cover gamergate initially.

1513
01:05:25,540 --> 01:05:26,373
And I've,
I've grown to become friends with them 

1514
01:05:27,340 --> 01:05:28,990
and people find it really.
Oh,

1515
01:05:28,991 --> 01:05:29,824
because he's a conservative and I'm a 
liberal and I just tried to explain to 

1516
01:05:32,771 --> 01:05:33,460
them that look,
right,

1517
01:05:33,460 --> 01:05:34,293
we've come to the point where it's not 
really about political affiliation to 

1518
01:05:37,850 --> 01:05:38,683
left and right.
It's about whether we can agree on 

1519
01:05:40,511 --> 01:05:41,620
reality,
you know,

1520
01:05:41,621 --> 01:05:44,940
we can interpret this reality and have 
our own opinions in any way.

1521
01:05:45,190 --> 01:05:46,340
I'm sure that he's got a lot of 
opinions,

1522
01:05:46,360 --> 01:05:47,193
things that I disagree with,
so if we can agree that the numbers are 

1523
01:05:49,600 --> 01:05:52,190
such that the events are as follows,
you know,

1524
01:05:52,260 --> 01:05:54,370
whereas the progressive left will lie to
you.

1525
01:05:54,820 --> 01:05:58,090
They will lie to themselves like that 
what we said that will cherry pick their

1526
01:05:58,091 --> 01:06:00,400
narrative.
They'll choose several data points,

1527
01:06:00,430 --> 01:06:02,470
leave out the ones that contradict what 
they've said,

1528
01:06:02,830 --> 01:06:04,660
and then if you don't agree with that 
narrative,

1529
01:06:04,990 --> 01:06:07,200
they consider you persona non grata.
You're,

1530
01:06:07,201 --> 01:06:08,260
you're,
you're,

1531
01:06:08,320 --> 01:06:10,070
you may as well be,
you know,

1532
01:06:10,120 --> 01:06:12,200
bill o'reilly or something like that in 
that month.

1533
01:06:12,600 --> 01:06:13,950
Just to be very clear,
you're not just,

1534
01:06:13,980 --> 01:06:15,990
you're not just saying something for the
sake of saying it.

1535
01:06:15,991 --> 01:06:16,824
I mean,
I have literally seen this happen to me 

1536
01:06:19,350 --> 01:06:20,550
just to be very clear.
I mean,

1537
01:06:20,551 --> 01:06:23,790
this is exactly what's happened to me,
which I now wear as a badge of pride,

1538
01:06:23,791 --> 01:06:24,624
by the way.

1539
01:06:24,630 --> 01:06:25,370
Yes.
Well,

1540
01:06:25,370 --> 01:06:27,300
let.
This is one of the things when you first

1541
01:06:27,301 --> 01:06:29,550
introduce people to this and they don't 
know anything about sales.

1542
01:06:30,360 --> 01:06:32,810
I honestly think there's a lot of.
They,

1543
01:06:32,910 --> 01:06:36,520
they protect themselves with audacity 
and I mean I,

1544
01:06:36,530 --> 01:06:37,363
I'm a big fan of military history and 
audacity is one of those things that 

1545
01:06:39,480 --> 01:06:40,313
wins many wars because it's so 
unexpected and I really think that the 

1546
01:06:43,531 --> 01:06:44,364
things they do are so audacious that 
it's hard to persuade people that 

1547
01:06:47,581 --> 01:06:49,770
genuinely doing them because people hear
it and think,

1548
01:06:50,370 --> 01:06:51,790
I would never do that.
No,

1549
01:06:51,930 --> 01:06:52,830
do that.
You know,

1550
01:06:52,860 --> 01:06:54,900
I wouldn't do it.
I can't imagine anyone doing it.

1551
01:06:55,140 --> 01:06:57,450
That's not happening your life,
you know,

1552
01:06:57,451 --> 01:06:58,284
and they think that the person relating 
the information is the one telling the 

1553
01:07:00,541 --> 01:07:02,240
lie.
And so the progressives,

1554
01:07:02,241 --> 01:07:03,040
I think,
you know,

1555
01:07:03,040 --> 01:07:05,490
they really,
really take a couple this and say,

1556
01:07:05,491 --> 01:07:07,890
well that's because he's a racist and 
sexist and all these things.

1557
01:07:08,190 --> 01:07:09,023
And then the person that has to 
experience them acting as they act to 

1558
01:07:12,680 --> 01:07:14,220
read.
I've had so many people come back and we

1559
01:07:14,221 --> 01:07:15,054
get mad.
I thought you were full of nonsense 

1560
01:07:16,710 --> 01:07:17,400
when,
uh,

1561
01:07:17,400 --> 01:07:20,040
when I first had to,
but that was exactly how they are.

1562
01:07:20,280 --> 01:07:21,600
Exactly how they.
And I'm like,

1563
01:07:21,601 --> 01:07:22,800
yeah mate,
I told you honestly,

1564
01:07:22,801 --> 01:07:23,910
don't worry about it,
you know,

1565
01:07:23,940 --> 01:07:24,320
just.
No,

1566
01:07:24,320 --> 01:07:24,930
no,
no,

1567
01:07:24,930 --> 01:07:26,040
no harm,
no foul sort of thing.

1568
01:07:26,041 --> 01:07:26,874
It's,
it happens to everyone because at first 

1569
01:07:28,501 --> 01:07:30,390
when you first hear it sounds like 
nonsense,

1570
01:07:30,870 --> 01:07:32,400
you can't believe anyone would act this 
way.

1571
01:07:32,401 --> 01:07:33,234
And yet they do.

1572
01:07:33,580 --> 01:07:34,413
Do you sometimes think that maybe the 
best way to beat them at this point is 

1573
01:07:37,331 --> 01:07:40,390
just to ignore them?
Because I think over the last six months

1574
01:07:40,391 --> 01:07:42,610
between what we do here,
what you do,

1575
01:07:43,090 --> 01:07:43,923
what many other people are doing,
especially in the digital space now and 

1576
01:07:46,871 --> 01:07:48,940
what Bill Maher has done a little bit 
more in the mainstream,

1577
01:07:48,941 --> 01:07:52,390
there's been,
they've been exposed and I think because

1578
01:07:52,391 --> 01:07:54,730
as you said,
they're stewing in their juices now.

1579
01:07:54,731 --> 01:07:55,820
Part of me is just like,
Eh,

1580
01:07:56,010 --> 01:07:58,180
let,
let's just ignore them and then,

1581
01:07:58,181 --> 01:07:59,014
you know,
then there's another piece of me that 

1582
01:07:59,831 --> 01:08:03,010
says we have to keep on the attack.
Which do you think would be a better,

1583
01:08:03,140 --> 01:08:03,973
uh,

1584
01:08:04,830 --> 01:08:06,560
offering them as a very dangerous 
tactic?

1585
01:08:06,650 --> 01:08:07,980
I think the,
the,

1586
01:08:08,150 --> 01:08:08,983
the problem,
the problem with that is that you have 

1587
01:08:11,451 --> 01:08:13,940
the initiative to them and you say,
you know,

1588
01:08:13,950 --> 01:08:15,620
I'm,
I'm not gonna pay attention,

1589
01:08:15,920 --> 01:08:16,910
excuse me,
to what you're doing.

1590
01:08:17,240 --> 01:08:18,073
And therefore whatever it is they do and
you're not really aware of and suddenly 

1591
01:08:21,080 --> 01:08:23,090
something will come at you that you're 
not prepared for.

1592
01:08:23,390 --> 01:08:24,223
I.
And also it gives them the ground to 

1593
01:08:27,050 --> 01:08:30,770
continue propagating their ideological 
position that gets them,

1594
01:08:30,790 --> 01:08:31,940
you know,
there's no,

1595
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:34,070
there's no resistance.
And so,

1596
01:08:34,550 --> 01:08:35,080
I mean,
it's,

1597
01:08:35,080 --> 01:08:36,930
it own twists a yeah,
she'll eat it.

1598
01:08:36,980 --> 01:08:38,330
Maybe.
Maybe there's little resistance.

1599
01:08:38,331 --> 01:08:40,850
But like if,
if you get a group,

1600
01:08:40,880 --> 01:08:44,240
a little delegation of progressives who 
come to a place and they say,

1601
01:08:44,270 --> 01:08:45,103
oh,
we'd like to talk to you about women's 

1602
01:08:45,921 --> 01:08:47,550
equality,
or you call it,

1603
01:08:47,680 --> 01:08:48,680
go on,
then you know.

1604
01:08:48,810 --> 01:08:50,930
And so your boss might like,
you know,

1605
01:08:50,931 --> 01:08:51,680
he's just a good guy.

1606
01:08:51,680 --> 01:08:52,780
He doesn't know.
He's just,

1607
01:08:52,810 --> 01:08:53,160
Oh,
right,

1608
01:08:53,160 --> 01:08:54,290
okay,
well I'll do whatever I can.

1609
01:08:54,291 --> 01:08:55,124
You know.
And suddenly these people are now 

1610
01:08:56,541 --> 01:08:57,374
advising the upper echelons of this 
company and then they stopped enforcing 

1611
01:09:01,491 --> 01:09:05,510
ideological conformity and then suddenly
you're in this position where,

1612
01:09:05,750 --> 01:09:06,583
I mean this happened to major game 
studios has happened to like games 

1613
01:09:08,691 --> 01:09:10,050
workshop.
It's there,

1614
01:09:10,060 --> 01:09:12,980
there are,
there are lots of people who have fallen

1615
01:09:12,981 --> 01:09:17,981
prey to the velvet glove of social 
justice that contains within it the iron

1616
01:09:19,401 --> 01:09:21,470
fist.
But it's just really well hidden.

1617
01:09:21,471 --> 01:09:23,220
So no,
I don't think we can just,

1618
01:09:23,660 --> 01:09:24,493
I think we have to fight them when we 
have to show people that there is a 

1619
01:09:26,571 --> 01:09:29,480
better alternative knots,
the eternal point you've,

1620
01:09:29,570 --> 01:09:31,640
you've got to provide a better 
alternative.

1621
01:09:31,641 --> 01:09:34,130
And universal liberal principles,
in my opinion,

1622
01:09:34,131 --> 01:09:37,610
are the highest alternative there.
There isn't anything better.

1623
01:09:37,700 --> 01:09:41,960
You can't get anything more fair than 
normal liberal principles.

1624
01:09:42,080 --> 01:09:42,913
So I,
I honestly think just just pushing 

1625
01:09:45,051 --> 01:09:45,884
these,
you know,

1626
01:09:45,890 --> 01:09:46,723
showing people these are the best way to
do things in this not only encourages 

1627
01:09:50,360 --> 01:09:54,380
equal treatment of people into the law 
and any kind of social situation,

1628
01:09:54,381 --> 01:09:55,214
but it also,
it also pushes people to be the best 

1629
01:09:57,261 --> 01:09:59,570
that they can be.
It doesn't encourage them to be victims,

1630
01:09:59,820 --> 01:10:02,910
it doesn't hurt them to get,
to be depressed and to,

1631
01:10:02,940 --> 01:10:04,150
to milk it,
you know,

1632
01:10:04,370 --> 01:10:05,203
there's no room for fraud when you come 
to these sorts of meritocratic 

1633
01:10:08,030 --> 01:10:09,860
principles.
People have to work,

1634
01:10:09,861 --> 01:10:11,780
they have to push themselves and become 
better.

1635
01:10:12,140 --> 01:10:15,470
And it's about raising the human 
condition rather than dragging it down,

1636
01:10:15,740 --> 01:10:17,180
which is everything about regressing.

1637
01:10:17,390 --> 01:10:18,223
Yeah.
Well naturally I believe in what you're 

1638
01:10:19,821 --> 01:10:21,500
saying and that's why I'm doing what I'm
doing.

1639
01:10:21,800 --> 01:10:23,540
So I really,
more than anything else,

1640
01:10:23,541 --> 01:10:24,590
I should thank you because,
you know,

1641
01:10:24,591 --> 01:10:25,424
there were a couple key people that 
helped my awakening and when I had that 

1642
01:10:28,731 --> 01:10:31,130
conversation with you,
a on your channel,

1643
01:10:31,131 --> 01:10:34,580
that was one of the first times that I 
really started talking about this stuff.

1644
01:10:34,670 --> 01:10:35,503
Uh,
so you were definitely a key piece in 

1645
01:10:36,411 --> 01:10:37,790
that,
so I appreciate that.

1646
01:10:38,040 --> 01:10:39,920
Uh,
and I appreciate all the work you do and

1647
01:10:39,921 --> 01:10:43,670
everyone can find out more of SAR guns.
Take on gamer gate,

1648
01:10:43,671 --> 01:10:44,504
feminism,
regressives and plenty more over on his 

1649
01:10:46,581 --> 01:10:49,430
youtube channel,
which is youtube.com/Sargon

1650
01:10:49,431 --> 01:10:50,264
of a cod 100 and Sargon Karl.
Or do you have any other names that I 

1651
01:10:54,651 --> 01:10:57,230
need to know about?
Let's just say those are the big two.

1652
01:10:57,231 --> 01:10:58,064
All right,
well I appreciate it and thank you guys 

1653
01:10:59,031 --> 01:11:00,740
for watching and we'll do it again next 
week.
