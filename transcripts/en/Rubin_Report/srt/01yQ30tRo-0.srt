1
00:00:05,030 --> 00:00:06,000
Well,
this is it.

2
00:00:06,110 --> 00:00:06,943
Our last direct message before Donald 
trump is sworn in as the 45th president 

3
00:00:10,791 --> 00:00:11,624
of the United States,
according to half of the media and 

4
00:00:13,551 --> 00:00:14,384
countless celebrities,
January 20th will be the beginning of 

5
00:00:16,341 --> 00:00:17,174
the Armageddon.
According to trump supporters and lots 

6
00:00:19,161 --> 00:00:23,090
of anime avatars on twitter.
January 20th will be the single greatest

7
00:00:23,091 --> 00:00:25,940
day in world history.
I however,

8
00:00:25,941 --> 00:00:26,774
think that the truth lies somewhere in 
between the bloviation of Michael Moore 

9
00:00:29,871 --> 00:00:30,704
and the memes of pepe.
The frog in the space between these two 

10
00:00:35,031 --> 00:00:35,864
extremes is some incredibly fertile 
ground for those of us who want to make 

11
00:00:38,961 --> 00:00:41,210
this country sane again.
Think about it.

12
00:00:41,211 --> 00:00:42,044
When was the last time you felt that 
there was so much going on that was 

13
00:00:44,601 --> 00:00:47,360
changing the world all around us all at 
once?

14
00:00:47,780 --> 00:00:48,613
Maybe you're thinking back to eight 
years ago when Barack Obama ran on hope 

15
00:00:50,991 --> 00:00:51,824
and change,
but actually think that there's more 

16
00:00:53,241 --> 00:00:55,340
opportunity right now than there was.

17
00:00:55,340 --> 00:00:58,940
Then we can debate whether Obama was a 
good president or not.

18
00:00:59,030 --> 00:00:59,863
I'd say pretty much yes on domestic 
policy and basically no on the 

19
00:01:02,631 --> 00:01:05,690
international front,
but in terms of actual change,

20
00:01:05,990 --> 00:01:09,620
did much really changed or did the 
system just keeps chugging along.

21
00:01:10,100 --> 00:01:11,990
By the way,
I don't have much of a problem with that

22
00:01:11,991 --> 00:01:14,150
system chugging along.
For all its faults,

23
00:01:14,151 --> 00:01:14,984
our system is still a pretty great one,
but if change was what you wanted eight 

24
00:01:18,831 --> 00:01:19,664
years ago,
I'm not really sure that's what you got 

25
00:01:22,670 --> 00:01:23,503
with trump though.
There can be no doubt that change is 

26
00:01:25,251 --> 00:01:26,084
coming.
Everything about trump from the way he 

27
00:01:27,531 --> 00:01:28,364
debated his tweets,
his cabinet picks have been different 

28
00:01:31,131 --> 00:01:31,964
than anything before.
You may not like any of his tactics are 

29
00:01:34,671 --> 00:01:35,504
his choices,
but you can't argue that change isn't 

30
00:01:37,401 --> 00:01:39,320
happening right now.
This very second,

31
00:01:39,740 --> 00:01:42,260
and if you don't like the change that 
you see,

32
00:01:42,261 --> 00:01:45,710
it is your duty as a citizen to have 
your voice heard.

33
00:01:46,010 --> 00:01:46,843
Get out their protests or volunteer,
be part of the process with which you 

34
00:01:50,651 --> 00:01:52,820
are so upset right now.
Of course,

35
00:01:52,821 --> 00:01:54,230
by the same token,
if you're happy,

36
00:01:54,231 --> 00:01:57,800
trump won and you think he's the answer 
to political correctness and the rest of

37
00:01:57,801 --> 00:02:00,830
society's ills,
then you're about to be tested to.

38
00:02:01,100 --> 00:02:01,933
It's one thing to be against political 
correctness and for free speech when 

39
00:02:05,091 --> 00:02:05,924
you're in the opposition,
but it takes real character to be 

40
00:02:08,331 --> 00:02:09,164
against political correctness and for 
free speech when it's your guy that the 

41
00:02:12,441 --> 00:02:15,770
words are aimed at.
I think that most of you who watched the

42
00:02:15,771 --> 00:02:16,604
show aren't really on either one of 
these teams and instead care more about 

43
00:02:20,151 --> 00:02:22,490
principles then party.
Actually,

44
00:02:22,491 --> 00:02:26,360
I really believe it's not just you 
watching this channel who believed this,

45
00:02:26,570 --> 00:02:27,403
but it's pretty much everyone out there 
who isn't on the Democratic or 

46
00:02:29,751 --> 00:02:30,584
Republican payroll.
Many republicans made it clear they 

47
00:02:33,051 --> 00:02:35,720
wouldn't work with Obama,
which lead to gridlock,

48
00:02:35,750 --> 00:02:36,710
which led to trump.

49
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:37,993
Now,
many Democrats are making it clear that 

50
00:02:39,201 --> 00:02:40,034
they won't work with trump,
which really just makes them as bad as 

51
00:02:43,431 --> 00:02:44,264
the Republicans they have been 
complaining about for the past eight 

52
00:02:46,191 --> 00:02:49,520
years.
This isn't how our system is supposed to

53
00:02:49,521 --> 00:02:50,354
work.
By constantly being held hostage by two 

54
00:02:52,611 --> 00:02:53,444
parties who care more about stopping the
other one from succeeding than doing 

55
00:02:56,841 --> 00:03:00,670
anything positive in themselves.
This is clearly where we are.

56
00:03:00,671 --> 00:03:02,560
However,
and this is why change,

57
00:03:02,590 --> 00:03:05,470
real change is needed now more than 
ever.

58
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:06,633
The change shouldn't be about whether 
you vote for a Democrat or vote for a 

59
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:12,640
Republican,
though it should be about how much power

60
00:03:12,790 --> 00:03:16,090
we give any of these people to control 
our lives.

61
00:03:16,810 --> 00:03:17,643
Violent protests,
which unfortunately I think we're going 

62
00:03:19,191 --> 00:03:24,100
to have more and more of will only bring
more authoritarianism and state power.

63
00:03:24,430 --> 00:03:27,730
We need to change attitudes and win the 
battle of ideas,

64
00:03:27,731 --> 00:03:29,500
not just the battle of the day.

65
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:30,753
That's why I've spent the last year and 
a half talking about having honest 

66
00:03:33,281 --> 00:03:35,980
conversations and dealing with difficult
topics.

67
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:39,940
Every time we forego real debate and 
silence our opponents,

68
00:03:40,210 --> 00:03:44,080
we spawn a new set of people who will 
come in with easy answers.

69
00:03:44,380 --> 00:03:45,213
This is the space that the true bigots 
and actual authoritarians will flourish 

70
00:03:48,851 --> 00:03:49,684
in.
It doesn't matter if they're far 

71
00:03:50,861 --> 00:03:51,694
leftists who want to silence.
Critics are far rightists who want to 

72
00:03:54,791 --> 00:03:57,460
kick out immigrants.
They don't want conversation,

73
00:03:57,461 --> 00:03:58,294
they want control.
It's also why I'm completely convinced 

74
00:04:01,061 --> 00:04:05,980
that a new center is developing faster 
than even we realized traditional labels

75
00:04:05,981 --> 00:04:06,814
are becoming increasingly meaningless as
people realize that the battle is no 

76
00:04:10,271 --> 00:04:14,260
longer democrat versus Republican,
nor is it us verse them.

77
00:04:14,380 --> 00:04:18,760
The battle lines are now those who are 
truly for freedom versus those who would

78
00:04:18,761 --> 00:04:21,970
stifle it in the name of tolerance or 
the name of security.

79
00:04:22,510 --> 00:04:23,343
Thanks to the Internet though,
and the rising group of voices who are 

80
00:04:25,481 --> 00:04:26,314
calling out this nonsense.
We're starting to win some of these 

81
00:04:28,841 --> 00:04:31,600
battles and if trump has taught us 
anything,

82
00:04:31,870 --> 00:04:33,320
people like a winter.
Well,

83
00:04:33,321 --> 00:04:34,690
Alright Donald,
you won.

84
00:04:34,691 --> 00:04:35,524
So now it's time to do some real 
interviews and respond to some real 

85
00:04:38,531 --> 00:04:41,350
criticism.
I've got a chair for you right there.

86
00:04:42,370 --> 00:04:46,180
So while maybe I've lost the left or the
left has lost me,

87
00:04:46,181 --> 00:04:50,080
I now see that fertile ground that I'm 
going to start planting some seeds.

88
00:04:50,590 --> 00:04:51,423
These seeds will not only be to grow new
alliances with liberals and 

89
00:04:54,731 --> 00:04:57,580
conservatives,
but even Marxists and progressives,

90
00:04:57,850 --> 00:05:02,200
I have no desire to silence them or any 
of the people I disagree with.

91
00:05:02,201 --> 00:05:03,034
I want to continue to talk about the 
ideas which will help us avoid that 

92
00:05:07,061 --> 00:05:09,280
whole pesky armageddon thing that I 
mentioned earlier.

93
00:05:09,910 --> 00:05:10,743
We can do this together,
not by d platforming and through 

94
00:05:13,451 --> 00:05:14,284
violence,
but by consistently showing that the 

95
00:05:16,481 --> 00:05:17,314
ideas of freedom and liberty and the 
rights of the individual are the best 

96
00:05:20,411 --> 00:05:24,790
way to attain a society that values true
human equality.

97
00:05:25,510 --> 00:05:29,410
Joining me this week is author radio 
host and is Dennis prager.

98
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:30,513
A few weeks before the election,
I was at an event for his youtube 

99
00:05:32,621 --> 00:05:34,210
channel,
prager university,

100
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:35,193
and I heard Dennis his keynote speech.
I heard Dennis speak through his 

101
00:05:38,711 --> 00:05:43,360
conservative Lens about how the 
wonderful experiment that is America and

102
00:05:43,361 --> 00:05:45,790
his deep concern for the future of this 
country.

103
00:05:46,180 --> 00:05:48,730
While I know we have our disagreements 
about religion,

104
00:05:48,731 --> 00:05:50,050
gay marriage,
abortion,

105
00:05:50,051 --> 00:05:50,884
and a bunch of other things,
I see dentists as someone I can build a 

106
00:05:53,531 --> 00:05:58,010
bridge with because he'll honestly tell 
me what he believes and I'll do the same

107
00:05:58,550 --> 00:06:01,700
for every liberal that he may convert to
conservatism.

108
00:06:01,701 --> 00:06:02,534
I think I can convert just as many 
conservatives to liberalism and as I 

109
00:06:05,871 --> 00:06:06,704
said before,
these labels are becoming more and more 

110
00:06:08,301 --> 00:06:09,134
meaningless by the day.
It doesn't matter if we agree on every 

111
00:06:11,691 --> 00:06:12,524
little thing.
What matters is that will defend the 

112
00:06:14,421 --> 00:06:16,880
other person's right to liberty and 
freedom.

113
00:06:17,750 --> 00:06:18,583
As we enter this new phase of change,
it'll be up to us as to whether the 

114
00:06:21,621 --> 00:06:25,700
change is positive or negative.
Our system is stronger than one man,

115
00:06:25,940 --> 00:06:26,773
but one man can change the world.
Let's trade hope and change for the 

116
00:06:30,501 --> 00:06:34,310
courage of our convictions and let the 
chips fall where they may.

117
00:06:39,700 --> 00:06:43,330
Joining me this week is an author,
a nationally syndicated radio host,

118
00:06:43,331 --> 00:06:46,690
a columnist,
and the creator of Prager University,

119
00:06:46,691 --> 00:06:48,850
right here on the youtube,
Dennis prager.

120
00:06:48,851 --> 00:06:49,870
Welcome to the Rubin report

121
00:06:50,410 --> 00:06:53,680
to be with you,
so somehow we've only met once,

122
00:06:53,681 --> 00:06:54,514
although I feel that we're in the same 
space and that I know you sort of just 

123
00:06:58,541 --> 00:07:02,110
through your public self,
but the one time we met we were on Larry

124
00:07:02,110 --> 00:07:05,670
King's show on my own home aura and you 
know,

125
00:07:05,710 --> 00:07:06,543
they bring you on as the conservative 
and they brought me on as the liberal 

126
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:10,473
and I think it was a little bit around 
my kind of waking up to what was 

127
00:07:12,761 --> 00:07:16,600
happening with the left and we kind of 
agreed on a lot.

128
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:18,790
Not on everything,
but we agreed on a lot.

129
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:23,560
Do you find that odd that sometimes you 
can agree with a liberal because you are

130
00:07:23,950 --> 00:07:24,731
a conservative?
Oh,

131
00:07:24,731 --> 00:07:28,300
I couldn't agree with a liberal.
I can't agree with a leftist.

132
00:07:28,990 --> 00:07:29,823
I make the distinction between liberal 
left constantly because it needs to be 

133
00:07:32,921 --> 00:07:37,150
made.
The left is an enemy of liberalism and I

134
00:07:37,210 --> 00:07:39,910
love liberalism on cold,
a conservative.

135
00:07:40,270 --> 00:07:45,270
But the irony is I don't know pretty 
much of any value that I changed since I

136
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:47,410
was a liberal.
Remember,

137
00:07:47,810 --> 00:07:50,770
uh,
I was born in New York,

138
00:07:51,110 --> 00:07:53,800
but a,
be a Jew,

139
00:07:54,430 --> 00:07:59,430
see Columbia.
So that's exactly,

140
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:03,280
that's a lot of democratic stuff.
That's Riley's.

141
00:08:03,820 --> 00:08:06,700
Exactly.
So that was a given to me.

142
00:08:06,701 --> 00:08:09,220
You were all those three things.
It's like,

143
00:08:09,230 --> 00:08:11,440
I always say on my birth certificate,
it had,

144
00:08:11,441 --> 00:08:13,830
you know,
on the days when you still had gender,

145
00:08:14,250 --> 00:08:15,100
gender,
Male,

146
00:08:15,430 --> 00:08:17,260
you know,
political affiliation,

147
00:08:17,290 --> 00:08:20,650
liberal or Democrat.
So it was just a given.

148
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:26,160
But I haven't changed my values that the
left has taken over the word liberal.

149
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:28,473
And so therefore I consider those values
inimical to everything liberalism stood 

150
00:08:32,651 --> 00:08:33,484
for.
So one of the things that I've been 

151
00:08:34,691 --> 00:08:35,524
saying is that lately defending my 
liberal values is becoming a 

152
00:08:38,711 --> 00:08:42,220
conservative position.
Now I suspect that's what,

153
00:08:42,221 --> 00:08:43,120
that's what I'm saying.

154
00:08:43,180 --> 00:08:45,670
What you felt when,
when did that change for you?

155
00:08:45,671 --> 00:08:47,110
So we changed.
For me,

156
00:08:47,900 --> 00:08:52,900
there were two seminal issues.
I knew I was not on the left when,

157
00:08:54,460 --> 00:08:55,293
during the Vietnam War,
which I was in college and I knew 

158
00:08:58,891 --> 00:09:03,030
communism was evil and my life is 
devoted to fighting evil.

159
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:05,130
That's what I care about more than 
anything.

160
00:09:05,730 --> 00:09:09,030
I hate people who hurt people 
deliberately.

161
00:09:09,031 --> 00:09:11,340
I hate them.
I want them destroyed.

162
00:09:11,370 --> 00:09:14,280
I want evil destroyed.
I have a,

163
00:09:14,570 --> 00:09:17,730
I have not wavered in that passion since
high school.

164
00:09:17,910 --> 00:09:19,500
That's all I really.
I mean,

165
00:09:19,510 --> 00:09:22,410
I care about a million things,
but that's my greatest care.

166
00:09:22,710 --> 00:09:24,800
I want to destroy evil.
Nazi-Ism,

167
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:26,370
communism,
Islamism,

168
00:09:26,610 --> 00:09:28,020
you name it.
Uh,

169
00:09:28,021 --> 00:09:32,040
and the left didn't.
The left hated Nazis,

170
00:09:32,041 --> 00:09:35,370
but they didn't hate communists.
So it meant they didn't hate evil.

171
00:09:36,180 --> 00:09:40,560
And that's my first realization that I 
wasn't on the left.

172
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:42,113
So,
but I still thought I was a liberal but 

173
00:09:43,501 --> 00:09:44,400
not on the left.

174
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:49,700
And then Ronald Reagan came and in one 
sentence it all turned for me and then I

175
00:09:50,101 --> 00:09:50,934
became a Republican.
And that was a government is not the 

176
00:09:54,811 --> 00:09:56,280
solution.
It's the problem.

177
00:09:56,710 --> 00:09:57,543
Um,
and that was an epiphany and I thought 

178
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:00,833
that's right.
There are truths that are so real that 

179
00:10:04,471 --> 00:10:05,304
if you have an open mind,
it doesn't take more than five seconds 

180
00:10:08,131 --> 00:10:08,964
to realize it.
Does that necessarily make you a 

181
00:10:11,491 --> 00:10:14,550
republican or does that really just make
you a classical liberal?

182
00:10:14,551 --> 00:10:15,384
And I know I always say on this show,
I have to use a lot of these terms that 

183
00:10:17,701 --> 00:10:22,701
I think are starting to lose meaning,
but we need them just to have labels.

184
00:10:23,281 --> 00:10:24,120
That's fine.
But.

185
00:10:24,121 --> 00:10:25,530
So what made you then say,
okay,

186
00:10:25,531 --> 00:10:28,740
well now I'm a Republican because that 
you could use that Reagan quote and say,

187
00:10:28,741 --> 00:10:29,850
well,
I'm a classical liberal.

188
00:10:29,950 --> 00:10:32,130
It's individually in limited government.

189
00:10:32,130 --> 00:10:35,100
Yes.
But the home for classical liberalism is

190
00:10:35,101 --> 00:10:38,970
the Republican party to the extent that 
they're not big government people,

191
00:10:38,971 --> 00:10:41,070
which George W Bush was,
for example,

192
00:10:41,430 --> 00:10:42,263
but the only home between Democrats and 
Republicans for limited government 

193
00:10:46,681 --> 00:10:50,910
people is the Republican Party.
Do you sense that changing now?

194
00:10:51,420 --> 00:10:53,850
Obviously we're gonna have to talk a 
little bit about trump here.

195
00:10:53,870 --> 00:10:54,703
Uh,
I think at first maybe you weren't 

196
00:10:56,731 --> 00:10:58,660
supporting him and then you 
progressionally were.

197
00:10:58,670 --> 00:11:00,120
And then I think basically you supported
him.

198
00:11:00,121 --> 00:11:00,691
Is that.
Yeah,

199
00:11:00,691 --> 00:11:01,501
I just don't want it.
Well,

200
00:11:01,501 --> 00:11:03,120
I,
I actually,

201
00:11:03,210 --> 00:11:04,043
uh,
I'm proud to say all the time will tell 

202
00:11:06,241 --> 00:11:10,530
whether I will be proud to say yeah,
but I was thoroughly consistent.

203
00:11:11,220 --> 00:11:15,450
I was opposed to him the most among all 
the Republicans.

204
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:16,553
And I wrote piece after piece in 
National Review Town Hall and other 

205
00:11:19,141 --> 00:11:22,530
places where my column appears,
I wa,

206
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:27,640
I was anti trump as anyone,
but I wrote from my first column,

207
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:31,410
if he wins the nomination,
I will vote for him.

208
00:11:31,950 --> 00:11:32,783
And My,
my thinking was clear in retrospect was 

209
00:11:36,841 --> 00:11:38,240
clear.
Uh,

210
00:11:38,310 --> 00:11:40,500
I,
I kept giving this analogy.

211
00:11:41,490 --> 00:11:42,323
If you have two doors over one door,
it says man eating lion and over the 

212
00:11:47,041 --> 00:11:52,041
other it says maybe a man I will open 
the maybe a man eating lion.

213
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:54,333
I don't see it as a big dilemma.
So this really was more of a reflection 

214
00:11:57,851 --> 00:11:59,830
of your feelings on hillary than 
anything else.

215
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:00,673
No,
no,

216
00:12:00,850 --> 00:12:03,820
no.
It's that feelings on the left,

217
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:09,720
defeating the left is as great a moral 
urgency as defeating Islam.

218
00:12:10,060 --> 00:12:12,070
Islam.
Those are the two,

219
00:12:12,610 --> 00:12:13,443
uh,
enemies of Western civilization as we 

220
00:12:16,061 --> 00:12:16,894
know it.
And I say that I would sadness there 

221
00:12:19,701 --> 00:12:22,490
were a lot of Nice people on the left.
Uh,

222
00:12:22,510 --> 00:12:25,990
the probably not that many Nice 
Islamicists all the grid that.

223
00:12:26,710 --> 00:12:27,543
But there isn't.
This wouldn't be too thrilled about 

224
00:12:28,601 --> 00:12:29,171
this.
Uh,

225
00:12:29,171 --> 00:12:32,410
they would not go to Brooklyn born Jews.
Well,

226
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:34,850
the left wouldn't be too thrilled with 
the seat.

227
00:12:35,260 --> 00:12:36,870
We're going to get into a little bit of 
that,

228
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:39,520
but I mean it sincerely.
Look,

229
00:12:39,550 --> 00:12:41,110
look at what they're doing to the 
university.

230
00:12:41,111 --> 00:12:44,800
The university is now becoming a fishing
stick place literally,

231
00:12:45,460 --> 00:12:46,240
uh,
with the,

232
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:51,240
with the old semi cuase I violent 
suppression of dissenting voices.

233
00:12:51,670 --> 00:12:56,410
And the reason it is the only place the 
left runs without opposition.

234
00:12:56,710 --> 00:12:59,410
So when the left is free to do what it 
wants,

235
00:12:59,620 --> 00:13:03,550
just look at your local university and 
you see what's happening.

236
00:13:04,150 --> 00:13:04,983
Okay?
So then

237
00:13:05,310 --> 00:13:08,190
what's happening there?
What do you think is in the mind?

238
00:13:08,191 --> 00:13:10,770
And I was around these people a lot for 
a long time and I don't know that I have

239
00:13:10,771 --> 00:13:13,110
the right answer to this.
What is happening,

240
00:13:13,111 --> 00:13:13,944
where they have created this system of 
what now I'm calling the oppression 

241
00:13:16,861 --> 00:13:20,010
Olympics where you know,
your hood is the highest virtue that you

242
00:13:20,011 --> 00:13:20,844
can have and we have to place 
everybody's victim hood below yours 

243
00:13:23,461 --> 00:13:25,170
because that means you're better than 
them and all that stuff.

244
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:27,150
What happened there?
What,

245
00:13:27,210 --> 00:13:28,380
where did this come from?

246
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:29,433
Well,
for one,

247
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:30,280
there are many,
many,

248
00:13:30,281 --> 00:13:31,114
and it's very hard.
Analyzing the left has been as complex 

249
00:13:35,171 --> 00:13:36,520
to me as you know,
the,

250
00:13:36,521 --> 00:13:39,700
the search for string theory is among 
physicists.

251
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:40,833
It because it's so emotional that there 
isn't the logical consistency for one 

252
00:13:45,821 --> 00:13:46,654
answer to your question is the,
the left does not divide the world 

253
00:13:50,170 --> 00:13:52,600
between good and bad.
I do,

254
00:13:52,970 --> 00:13:54,490
uh,
but the left doesn't.

255
00:13:54,491 --> 00:13:59,170
The left divides up between rich and 
poor and strong and weak,

256
00:14:00,010 --> 00:14:00,843
uh,
so,

257
00:14:00,850 --> 00:14:01,471
uh,
or,

258
00:14:01,471 --> 00:14:04,780
or victim and victimizer.
So you get,

259
00:14:04,781 --> 00:14:06,640
you don't get your strength from being 
right.

260
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:09,880
You get your strength from being a 
victim,

261
00:14:11,170 --> 00:14:13,940
from being the underdog.
That's the reason the leftist,

262
00:14:13,990 --> 00:14:14,823
Pro Palestinian.
Anyone with a moral compass that works 

263
00:14:18,910 --> 00:14:19,743
some of the time knows that there was no
comparison between Israel and the 

264
00:14:23,561 --> 00:14:28,561
Palestinians morally speaking,
but the left routes for the Palestinians

265
00:14:28,930 --> 00:14:32,740
because not because they don't measure 
by good and bad,

266
00:14:32,950 --> 00:14:37,300
they measure by weakened strong black 
and white,

267
00:14:37,420 --> 00:14:40,780
west and non west,
first world and third world,

268
00:14:40,900 --> 00:14:41,733
but not good and evil.
So that's a big factor that's taking 

269
00:14:44,501 --> 00:14:45,334
place on the campus.
How do you define good and evil before 

270
00:14:47,111 --> 00:14:49,750
you go the same way,
the same way you do?

271
00:14:49,751 --> 00:14:52,040
I mean it,
it's not a trick issue.

272
00:14:52,370 --> 00:14:53,203
A good is treating people decently,
is having an openness to a opposing 

273
00:14:58,551 --> 00:15:00,830
views without suppressing them,
uh,

274
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:04,530
is not building concentration camps.
I mean it's.

275
00:15:04,610 --> 00:15:07,240
This is not.
This is not rocket science.

276
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:07,920
Exactly.

277
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:08,753
Yeah.
So last time I saw you was at a prager 

278
00:15:12,631 --> 00:15:13,464
university event and you gave the 
keynote speech was the keynote speech 

279
00:15:17,430 --> 00:15:18,263
and I,
it was right before the election and I 

280
00:15:20,431 --> 00:15:24,870
sensed that you actually do want to 
build some bridges with these people,

281
00:15:24,871 --> 00:15:28,410
which is probably partially why.
Why were sitting down that you weren't.

282
00:15:28,411 --> 00:15:31,950
I didn't think you were really clear.
You don't like what's happening with the

283
00:15:31,951 --> 00:15:32,784
modern left,
but I do sense that you're trying to 

284
00:15:34,081 --> 00:15:35,640
figure out a way to reach out to some of
these people,

285
00:15:35,641 --> 00:15:37,890
which is what you're doing with prager 
u.

286
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:41,700
are you seeing any real attraction and 
waking some of these people up?

287
00:15:42,030 --> 00:15:42,863
All the,
I know we're waking people up because 

288
00:15:44,820 --> 00:15:45,653
there was no,
not one of the 150 prager university 

289
00:15:48,901 --> 00:15:50,410
videos.
They're all journal,

290
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:53,760
five minutes,
just some burly fine fingers.

291
00:15:53,761 --> 00:15:58,761
Give them not one of them yells at you.
It's a,

292
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:02,910
hey,
here is our position,

293
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:04,273
here is the reason and here are the 
facts behind it and have a wonderful 

294
00:16:08,101 --> 00:16:08,934
day.
So isn't it funny that that became not 

295
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:13,591
the norm?
I mean,

296
00:16:13,591 --> 00:16:16,070
people say to me all the time,
I Love Your Show because you Aka people.

297
00:16:16,140 --> 00:16:17,220
That's right.
Well,

298
00:16:17,221 --> 00:16:19,080
I get that.
Do you know why get that's funny.

299
00:16:19,081 --> 00:16:19,914
You should say that I've been 
broadcasting 33 years and the most 

300
00:16:24,421 --> 00:16:28,100
common among the most common,
maybe it is the most,

301
00:16:28,101 --> 00:16:30,330
or it's among the most common reactions 
I get.

302
00:16:31,020 --> 00:16:31,531
God,
you know,

303
00:16:31,531 --> 00:16:34,470
what I really love about your show is 
you're calm.

304
00:16:34,530 --> 00:16:35,910
You know,
you never yell.

305
00:16:36,390 --> 00:16:37,223
In fact,
I do yell about four times a year where 

306
00:16:40,890 --> 00:16:44,040
something will get me so angry maybe six
times a year.

307
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:49,380
And I always apologize because I read 
readers,

308
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:50,273
listeners tell me we love it when you 
yell because it's so rare and they 

309
00:16:55,501 --> 00:16:56,610
realize you know,
you,

310
00:16:56,611 --> 00:16:59,370
you can really,
you can prick me and I'll bleed.

311
00:16:59,670 --> 00:17:00,400
But,
uh,

312
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:02,820
it's,
I just can't stand yelling.

313
00:17:02,890 --> 00:17:03,723
Yeah,
well to me it's sort of like a well 

314
00:17:04,521 --> 00:17:06,670
placed fuck,
I don't say it that often.

315
00:17:06,671 --> 00:17:09,520
Even just saying it now,
I probably haven't said it on air and in

316
00:17:09,521 --> 00:17:10,354
quite some time,

317
00:17:10,460 --> 00:17:11,890
but that I brought it out.
You,

318
00:17:11,940 --> 00:17:12,990
you see,
you the way you,

319
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:13,150
it

320
00:17:13,150 --> 00:17:13,983
rage me here that you've.
So you feel like you have made some 

321
00:17:16,721 --> 00:17:17,554
traction because you're,
you're hearing from people that are 

322
00:17:20,051 --> 00:17:20,471
saying,
wow,

323
00:17:20,471 --> 00:17:21,280
there's some.

324
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:25,510
The problem is,
and it is a problem veet veet.

325
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:27,550
Uh,
um,

326
00:17:27,590 --> 00:17:29,100
what's the word?
Uh,

327
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:31,353
uh,
when,

328
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:33,550
when you're not taught,
you are indoctrinated.

329
00:17:33,940 --> 00:17:38,940
The indoctrination of,
of American kids begin so early.

330
00:17:39,370 --> 00:17:44,370
You're taught now in third grade,
you are taught in,

331
00:17:44,451 --> 00:17:48,040
in many of the states about carbon 
emissions.

332
00:17:48,580 --> 00:17:49,413
They don't show them a Bjorn Lomborg 
video saying that we're wasting 

333
00:17:53,851 --> 00:17:58,530
trillions of dollars to lower the 
temperature by a fraction of a degree.

334
00:17:58,980 --> 00:18:02,940
They don't show them because they don't 
believe there are other sides.

335
00:18:03,150 --> 00:18:08,150
There are truth tellers and deniers.
They are truth tellers are anti science.

336
00:18:08,550 --> 00:18:11,140
By the way.
One of the things was I studied leftism.

337
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:12,480
That was my,
uh,

338
00:18:12,481 --> 00:18:13,314
I,
I studied communist affairs marks 

339
00:18:15,121 --> 00:18:15,954
leftism,
and one of the things that they have 

340
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:23,600
always excelled at is one word 
dismissals of their ideological enemies.

341
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:28,650
So Stalin Trotsky,
Trotsky the father of Bolshevism.

342
00:18:28,651 --> 00:18:32,490
He called him a fascist.
So Trotsky was a fascist.

343
00:18:32,970 --> 00:18:37,950
There was no need to debate Trotsky.
You call him a fascist and then have him

344
00:18:37,951 --> 00:18:39,930
killed with an ice.
Pick that.

345
00:18:39,931 --> 00:18:40,764
And that's,
that's in a nutshell what the left six 

346
00:18:43,501 --> 00:18:45,080
herb,
sexist intolerant,

347
00:18:45,090 --> 00:18:46,110
xenophobic,
homophobic,

348
00:18:46,111 --> 00:18:47,070
Islamophobic,
racist,

349
00:18:47,071 --> 00:18:47,904
bigoted.
There was no need to think on the left 

350
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:53,040
because you have a one word dismissal of
your opponents.

351
00:18:53,060 --> 00:18:53,430
Yeah.

352
00:18:53,430 --> 00:18:54,263
So,
so far I know that 90 percent of my 

353
00:18:55,441 --> 00:18:56,820
audience listening to this is going to 
go,

354
00:18:56,821 --> 00:18:59,130
all right,
this prager guy for conservative.

355
00:18:59,470 --> 00:19:00,510
This,
this makes sense.

356
00:19:00,511 --> 00:19:01,140
I mean,
you're,

357
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:04,170
you're hitting the keys that I hit here 
all the time.

358
00:19:04,470 --> 00:19:07,020
So what about on something like science,
because you,

359
00:19:07,030 --> 00:19:07,863
you just mentioned sight.
This seems to me where the Republicans 

360
00:19:10,230 --> 00:19:12,840
and the right.
It just doesn't add up.

361
00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:15,870
We're still debating evolution.
We're debating climate science.

362
00:19:15,871 --> 00:19:16,704
I'm not a scientist.
I've brought climate scientists in here 

363
00:19:20,220 --> 00:19:22,980
who have said in unison,
basically they agree by the way I've had

364
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:24,750
Alex Epstein is books right there,

365
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:25,793
a moral case for fossil fuels and I was 
happy to talk to him as well and he 

366
00:19:28,261 --> 00:19:30,320
takes it from a different angle and I'm 
happy to have those

367
00:19:30,330 --> 00:19:33,050
compensation and I don't pretend to know
everything so.

368
00:19:33,300 --> 00:19:34,133
So there you go.
But science to me is one of the things 

369
00:19:35,731 --> 00:19:37,020
where the right has just

370
00:19:37,350 --> 00:19:38,183
no gone by.
It's just one of those things where the 

371
00:19:40,081 --> 00:19:42,360
left has effectively demonized the 
right.

372
00:19:43,050 --> 00:19:48,050
Our position.
I've never met somebody on the right who

373
00:19:48,061 --> 00:19:51,540
said the science is wrong.
It's not solid evolution,

374
00:19:51,541 --> 00:19:52,231
for example.
Okay,

375
00:19:52,231 --> 00:19:52,681
well,
all right,

376
00:19:52,681 --> 00:19:56,160
so you're wanting to evolution.
So evolution is very complex issue.

377
00:19:56,161 --> 00:19:57,420
Believe it or not,
by the way,

378
00:19:57,421 --> 00:19:58,254
I don't have a particular ax to grind.
I happen to believe in God and my 

379
00:20:00,841 --> 00:20:05,010
position for most of my life was okay.
God created evolution.

380
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:07,590
I have no issue.
So concurrently,

381
00:20:07,940 --> 00:20:08,773
that's not my position any longer 
because I simply know more science and 

382
00:20:13,571 --> 00:20:18,450
that if the science on evolution is not 
nearly as established as people think it

383
00:20:18,451 --> 00:20:20,420
is because the,
the,

384
00:20:20,430 --> 00:20:21,263
the paleontologists themselves are not 
so certain that it occurred in anywhere 

385
00:20:25,890 --> 00:20:28,930
near the way they believe it.
The two,

386
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:34,040
two quick things on that one is of 
course I just,

387
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:38,820
it's just needs to be stated that 
evolution has zero explanation.

388
00:20:38,850 --> 00:20:42,510
I mean zero,
none for the creation of life.

389
00:20:43,860 --> 00:20:44,693
There was no,
there was no evolutionary jump between 

390
00:20:47,530 --> 00:20:48,363
inorganic and organic and,
and they acknowledge that they just say 

391
00:20:51,581 --> 00:20:54,640
one day they'll find one,
but there isn't one.

392
00:20:55,030 --> 00:21:00,030
So the evolutionist has nothing to say 
about the origin of life.

393
00:21:00,910 --> 00:21:01,743
They have something to say about the 
origin of species species once life 

394
00:21:05,470 --> 00:21:07,960
begins.
But that's a big difference.

395
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:13,320
The second part is they don't have a lot
to say even on the origin of species.

396
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:14,553
When you,
when you look at there was this thing 

397
00:21:15,761 --> 00:21:18,430
called the Cambrian.
Was it the Cambrian?

398
00:21:19,750 --> 00:21:22,270
My wife knows she's going crazy because 
she's in the other one.

399
00:21:22,690 --> 00:21:25,340
She's the real maven on this.
But the,

400
00:21:25,350 --> 00:21:28,480
the k onto an IFA,
Cambrian explosion.

401
00:21:28,481 --> 00:21:29,770
That's an explosion.
Yeah.

402
00:21:30,010 --> 00:21:33,430
This was when vast numbers of species or
rose,

403
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:37,900
but much too quickly for evolution to 
have accounted for them.

404
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:42,250
And there were so many qualified 
scientists who have taken this on.

405
00:21:42,460 --> 00:21:43,410
Even,
uh,

406
00:21:43,460 --> 00:21:46,750
even the famous Harvard paleontologist 
is passed away,

407
00:21:47,090 --> 00:21:49,300
uh,
whose name eludes me for the moment,

408
00:21:49,301 --> 00:21:51,310
but he,
he wrote about this.

409
00:21:51,550 --> 00:21:53,740
He was an,
he was an atheist or agnostic,

410
00:21:53,741 --> 00:21:54,574
you know,
but he said he had punctuated evolution 

411
00:21:58,110 --> 00:22:02,170
where it,
which is almost an oxymoron because it,

412
00:22:02,230 --> 00:22:02,980
it,
it,

413
00:22:02,980 --> 00:22:05,460
you know,
we're just things per day.

414
00:22:05,470 --> 00:22:06,700
Yeah.
Anyway,

415
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:12,120
my only point is that it's not as clear 
as they make.

416
00:22:12,510 --> 00:22:14,050
Now,
if somebody says to you,

417
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:19,560
I don't believe that the world was 
created in billions of years,

418
00:22:20,290 --> 00:22:21,130
that the,
you know,

419
00:22:21,190 --> 00:22:26,190
the world was created in six days,
24 hour periods,

420
00:22:26,531 --> 00:22:27,364
cold days.
That is a rejection of the science on 

421
00:22:29,940 --> 00:22:30,940
the matter.
That's right.

422
00:22:30,970 --> 00:22:31,803
Okay.
So I'm glad you're making that function 

423
00:22:32,831 --> 00:22:33,664
because we can.
Neither one of us are evolutionary 

424
00:22:35,670 --> 00:22:38,110
biology.
We can say as much as we know.

425
00:22:38,110 --> 00:22:38,591
And that,
by the way,

426
00:22:38,591 --> 00:22:40,060
just for the record,
just today,

427
00:22:40,061 --> 00:22:40,894
I had an interview with Jerry Coyne 
who's a world renowned and evolutionary 

428
00:22:44,291 --> 00:22:45,124
biologists who would,
I'm sure take issue with some of the 

429
00:22:46,931 --> 00:22:47,764
things you're saying here,
but we don't have to bicker over those 

430
00:22:50,141 --> 00:22:50,974
little things,
but you're juggling when someone looks 

431
00:22:51,970 --> 00:22:55,240
at the literal six day thing and here.
But here,

432
00:22:55,241 --> 00:22:56,720
I just want to say forgive me,
I,

433
00:22:56,730 --> 00:22:58,360
I really.
Yeah,

434
00:22:58,420 --> 00:23:02,590
let's get it.
I don't give a hoot if somebody believes

435
00:23:02,591 --> 00:23:05,380
God created the world in 60 slash 24 
hour periods.

436
00:23:05,660 --> 00:23:08,170
I care if they,
if they reject vaccines,

437
00:23:08,440 --> 00:23:11,170
if they don't give blood transfusions.
In other words,

438
00:23:11,171 --> 00:23:14,890
I don't care what people believe.
I care how people behave.

439
00:23:15,970 --> 00:23:18,430
This a very important principle in my 
life.

440
00:23:18,820 --> 00:23:23,500
So if you happen to believe that God 
created the world,

441
00:23:23,501 --> 00:23:25,930
which I don't because the science and 
the gates it.

442
00:23:26,680 --> 00:23:29,650
But if you believe,
and I believe that the Bible is,

443
00:23:29,660 --> 00:23:33,010
is divine and all that good stuff,
but uh,

444
00:23:33,070 --> 00:23:34,940
but nevertheless,
uh,

445
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:36,033
if you do believe that it here,
it is possible to be a professor of 

446
00:23:42,191 --> 00:23:46,610
medicine and believe God created the 
world in six days.

447
00:23:47,390 --> 00:23:48,223
I know that sounds oxymoronic,
but it isn't religious belief is 

448
00:23:52,581 --> 00:23:56,690
religious belief and scientific belief,
a scientific belief for many people.

449
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:57,793
I like to reconcile them,
but some just say I'm not reconciling 

450
00:24:01,731 --> 00:24:03,440
them.
This is what it says.

451
00:24:03,441 --> 00:24:06,350
I take it and now I would like to go 
back to my,

452
00:24:06,370 --> 00:24:08,930
uh,
medical lab police to do a research on,

453
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:10,040
on,
on cancer.

454
00:24:10,070 --> 00:24:10,910
Right?
So in,

455
00:24:10,911 --> 00:24:14,510
in some way though,
is that reconciliation sort of splitting

456
00:24:14,511 --> 00:24:17,060
the difference of what you truly believe
me,

457
00:24:17,061 --> 00:24:18,050
Dennis?
Yeah.

458
00:24:18,230 --> 00:24:21,170
No,
I believe in science and religion.

459
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:23,090
I don't think that there's a conflict at
all.

460
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:26,210
Truth is truth.
There's a Hebrew saying,

461
00:24:26,211 --> 00:24:29,450
the signature of God is truth.
If something is true,

462
00:24:29,510 --> 00:24:34,510
I must believe it because it's true.
I am religiously obligated to believe it

463
00:24:35,481 --> 00:24:36,490
if it's true.
Right?

464
00:24:36,680 --> 00:24:37,513
So if a doctor for you,
let's say you had to have heart surgery 

465
00:24:39,741 --> 00:24:42,330
or something and you had two doctors to 
choose from and,

466
00:24:42,490 --> 00:24:44,040
and they had the same exact,
you know,

467
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:46,430
medical background.
One of them said,

468
00:24:46,431 --> 00:24:49,390
I believe in evolution and science and 
all that stuff.

469
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:49,881
The other guy said,
well,

470
00:24:49,881 --> 00:24:50,714
you know,
the earth was created in six days and 

471
00:24:51,540 --> 00:24:56,540
guy I would flip a coin so that would 
have absolutely no role because they can

472
00:24:58,800 --> 00:24:59,633
compartmentalize,
not because I can not 

473
00:25:03,081 --> 00:25:06,830
compartmentalizing.
They can because I know.

474
00:25:06,831 --> 00:25:08,270
You see,
here's the interesting thing,

475
00:25:08,690 --> 00:25:12,130
there are a lot of orthodox Jews.
Um,

476
00:25:12,210 --> 00:25:14,180
I'm,
I'm a religious Jew but not orthodox,

477
00:25:14,780 --> 00:25:15,770
but there are a lot of.

478
00:25:15,770 --> 00:25:19,070
So I have,
this is not a no ax to grind.

479
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:23,240
There were a lot of orthodox Jews who 
were doctors who are physicists,

480
00:25:23,241 --> 00:25:25,070
who are chemists,
biologists.

481
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:26,233
How was that possible?
They believed the tourists from God and 

482
00:25:29,541 --> 00:25:33,170
they then go to the lab and do wonderful
scientific work.

483
00:25:33,410 --> 00:25:36,230
So obviously they've lived,
they live with both.

484
00:25:36,460 --> 00:25:37,293
Yeah.
So what does that say about humans in 

485
00:25:38,571 --> 00:25:39,404
general?
That we're just able to live with 

486
00:25:40,251 --> 00:25:41,090
Commonwealth.
Orion?

487
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:44,030
I have an interesting theory on that.
Uh,

488
00:25:44,180 --> 00:25:47,580
this is why the left scares me more than
a,

489
00:25:48,110 --> 00:25:48,790
you know,
the,

490
00:25:48,790 --> 00:25:49,623
the,
the leftist scared by religious 

491
00:25:50,991 --> 00:25:52,280
Christians,
for example.

492
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:54,950
I'm not scared by religious Christians 
at all.

493
00:25:55,490 --> 00:25:55,850
And,
um,

494
00:25:55,850 --> 00:25:57,020
again,
I emphasize them.

495
00:25:57,021 --> 00:25:59,240
I got,
I got your prager u card.

496
00:25:59,241 --> 00:26:00,320
I mean,
it said Merry Christmas.

497
00:26:00,321 --> 00:26:01,780
I freaked out and I,
you know,

498
00:26:01,781 --> 00:26:03,940
I sent the letter to the FBI,
but I don't know,

499
00:26:03,950 --> 00:26:06,020
I know that not only we were,
we were interviewed,

500
00:26:06,500 --> 00:26:10,040
told us you sent them a,
the,

501
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:15,010
uh,
the fear that they have is not,

502
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:16,010
is not comparable.

503
00:26:16,280 --> 00:26:18,320
And here is the theory.
So here's my theory.

504
00:26:19,530 --> 00:26:23,750
I,
the human being clearly needs to beliefs

505
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:24,793
some non rational things.
I believe that that is part of what the 

506
00:26:28,941 --> 00:26:33,941
human mind must have.
So the religious person,

507
00:26:35,030 --> 00:26:37,280
the healthy and I'm talking about 
healthy,

508
00:26:37,281 --> 00:26:38,114
religious,
unhealthy,

509
00:26:38,150 --> 00:26:39,770
nonreligious,
apples and apples.

510
00:26:40,370 --> 00:26:45,370
The healthy religious person confines 
his non rational thought to religiosity.

511
00:26:48,510 --> 00:26:53,510
The secular person,
when they have the non rational,

512
00:26:54,570 --> 00:26:59,570
they're much scarier because that is not
about splitting of cs or,

513
00:27:00,840 --> 00:27:05,790
or Jesus walking on water.
It's about real life.

514
00:27:06,420 --> 00:27:10,860
The amount of the non rational that is 
believed on the left,

515
00:27:11,190 --> 00:27:12,023
that is scary.
So basically a non rational in the 

516
00:27:15,750 --> 00:27:18,630
religious realm is not necessarily 
scary.

517
00:27:18,631 --> 00:27:20,610
It could be.
You believe you murder people.

518
00:27:20,611 --> 00:27:22,620
You get 72 virgins.
That scary.

519
00:27:22,700 --> 00:27:24,900
Yeah.
But there's a lot of people that believe

520
00:27:24,940 --> 00:27:26,740
you're right.
That's why he used Christians.

521
00:27:27,310 --> 00:27:28,143
America was founded by fundamentalist 
Christians who produced and incredibly 

522
00:27:32,071 --> 00:27:34,050
rational society.
Uh,

523
00:27:34,051 --> 00:27:35,150
and uh,
the,

524
00:27:35,170 --> 00:27:37,050
the,
the competitive marketplace,

525
00:27:37,051 --> 00:27:40,170
the free market liberty,
these were very rational ideas.

526
00:27:40,171 --> 00:27:43,350
They were very religious men.
Not all but many of them were.

527
00:27:43,860 --> 00:27:44,870
So,
uh,

528
00:27:44,970 --> 00:27:45,781
you know,
I,

529
00:27:45,781 --> 00:27:46,614
I and I,
I welcome secularism in Iran and I fear 

530
00:27:51,931 --> 00:27:53,160
secularism in America.

531
00:27:53,370 --> 00:27:54,440
Right?
That's it.

532
00:27:54,441 --> 00:27:55,274
I mean,
there's something really there between 

533
00:27:56,401 --> 00:27:58,370
those two things.
We probably have the rights society,

534
00:27:58,371 --> 00:27:59,204
I suppose.
Yeah.

535
00:28:00,090 --> 00:28:04,320
So it's interesting because I see this 
constantly and I'm sure you see it too,

536
00:28:04,321 --> 00:28:08,700
this constant attacking of straight 
white men have Christians.

537
00:28:08,701 --> 00:28:09,534
All of these things.
And what you're saying basically is we 

538
00:28:10,921 --> 00:28:11,754
were born out of Christianity,
America and we've become absurdly 

539
00:28:14,881 --> 00:28:17,130
tolerant and yet everyone,
not absurdly time.

540
00:28:17,131 --> 00:28:20,720
And I think it's wonderfully unique.
Uniquely right,

541
00:28:21,810 --> 00:28:25,500
and yet we have,
there's just this idea out there that we

542
00:28:25,501 --> 00:28:27,480
are the most intolerant place.
How do you,

543
00:28:27,510 --> 00:28:29,280
how do you fight those ideas back?

544
00:28:30,050 --> 00:28:30,770
How,
how,

545
00:28:30,770 --> 00:28:33,670
how you fight the irrational is very 
hard.

546
00:28:34,300 --> 00:28:36,670
It's very hard because you can give 
evidence.

547
00:28:37,240 --> 00:28:38,073
I give evidence for America being the 
least racist society that had multi 

548
00:28:41,830 --> 00:28:44,170
racial elements in it,
in history,

549
00:28:44,500 --> 00:28:46,980
and it doesn't,
doesn't convince people who have.

550
00:28:47,260 --> 00:28:50,230
If people have a vested interest in 
believing something,

551
00:28:50,650 --> 00:28:53,770
you can't talk them out of it,
and this is why I fear the left.

552
00:28:54,100 --> 00:28:57,050
They have the,
the world would collapse it.

553
00:28:57,051 --> 00:29:00,820
It is like the.
The famous book written when Stalin made

554
00:29:00,821 --> 00:29:01,654
this pact with Hitler.
All these communists in the left who 

555
00:29:03,881 --> 00:29:06,340
would followed,
who had followed Stalin.

556
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:08,350
Not all,
many of them thought,

557
00:29:08,351 --> 00:29:11,890
oh my God,
I've been believing in nonsense my whole

558
00:29:11,891 --> 00:29:13,740
life.
The God that failed.

559
00:29:13,741 --> 00:29:14,574
That's a very famous book from I think 
the fifties or maybe the forties and 

560
00:29:18,330 --> 00:29:18,731
and,
and,

561
00:29:18,731 --> 00:29:21,490
and it was about that,
that the,

562
00:29:21,550 --> 00:29:22,383
the left.

563
00:29:22,660 --> 00:29:24,860
Why do people believe in communism?
I mean it,

564
00:29:24,870 --> 00:29:27,430
it is,
it is drivel thing is drivel,

565
00:29:27,940 --> 00:29:32,530
but when people drop Judeo Christian 
religions,

566
00:29:32,560 --> 00:29:35,260
Catholicism Protestantism,
evangelicalism,

567
00:29:35,261 --> 00:29:36,670
mormonism,
Judaism,

568
00:29:36,910 --> 00:29:41,910
when people drop those,
they don't stop yearning for certitude,

569
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:45,730
so what they end up with is secular,
religious,

570
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:49,510
certitudes,
and they are at least as scary,

571
00:29:50,230 --> 00:29:52,150
so I don't think you would quite word it
this way,

572
00:29:52,151 --> 00:29:52,984
but I guess I would wear it as they get 
their letting go of the sort of easier 

573
00:29:56,381 --> 00:29:57,214
answers that religion might provide and 
then it's a little easier to sway them 

574
00:30:00,551 --> 00:30:04,240
in the secular arena.
Would you say that to say?

575
00:30:04,270 --> 00:30:06,130
Although I don't think you would wear to
quite that.

576
00:30:06,280 --> 00:30:07,113
That's one.
It's fine and it's also easier for 

577
00:30:09,071 --> 00:30:09,904
another reason.
Secularism makes no moral demands on 

578
00:30:12,281 --> 00:30:13,114
you,
tells you there is no God who judges 

579
00:30:14,561 --> 00:30:15,394
you.
So it's also you feel great about 

580
00:30:16,961 --> 00:30:20,650
yourself by taking the right position on
any left wing issue.

581
00:30:20,860 --> 00:30:22,480
I love.
I love blacks,

582
00:30:22,481 --> 00:30:24,880
I love gays,
I love Muslims.

583
00:30:24,881 --> 00:30:29,080
I love whoever the victim of the month 
is and I'm a wonderful human being.

584
00:30:29,260 --> 00:30:31,570
My daughter is a great girl.
Really?

585
00:30:31,571 --> 00:30:33,430
The she cheat on tests.
I don't know,

586
00:30:33,610 --> 00:30:35,420
but she does in fact,
uh,

587
00:30:35,470 --> 00:30:36,041
she,
she,

588
00:30:36,041 --> 00:30:39,100
uh,
does 10 k run for breast cancer.

589
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:41,350
That doesn't make you a daughter,
a good girl.

590
00:30:41,530 --> 00:30:44,690
That's a very sweet thing that she does.
But uh,

591
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:45,520
uh,
you are,

592
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:47,710
you are judged by your character,
right?

593
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:52,510
And there's no more character emphasis.
So I suspect since you live here in la,

594
00:30:52,511 --> 00:30:57,220
that you're friends with probably a lot 
of completely secular nonbelievers,

595
00:30:57,550 --> 00:30:59,020
uh,
who may not even,

596
00:30:59,021 --> 00:31:00,350
you might not even know they're 
nonbelievers.

597
00:31:00,520 --> 00:31:03,670
So what's the part that I'm missing?
I consider myself totally secular.

598
00:31:03,671 --> 00:31:08,230
I try to live by some sense of morality 
and whatever.

599
00:31:08,231 --> 00:31:10,210
And then like everyone else,
I fail at it sometimes,

600
00:31:10,510 --> 00:31:13,600
but what's the piece that you can't stay
on,

601
00:31:13,630 --> 00:31:15,490
on the good path,
so to speak,

602
00:31:15,491 --> 00:31:16,420
without religion?

603
00:31:17,230 --> 00:31:18,160
Well,
there are many.

604
00:31:18,161 --> 00:31:19,150
There are many.
I mean,

605
00:31:19,151 --> 00:31:19,984
why can't,
why you know that I be glued to my 

606
00:31:21,131 --> 00:31:24,890
neighbor and partner and those types of,
as I say,

607
00:31:25,070 --> 00:31:28,360
a billion times,
this is really critical.

608
00:31:28,750 --> 00:31:30,730
If there's no god,
there's no good and evil.

609
00:31:30,731 --> 00:31:32,620
There are only opinions about good and 
evil.

610
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:34,180
Having said that,
there are,

611
00:31:34,340 --> 00:31:36,640
they're a wonderful atheists and 
agnostics,

612
00:31:36,680 --> 00:31:38,720
secular and there were terrible 
religious people.

613
00:31:39,040 --> 00:31:39,873
I know that,
but if you want the long term survival 

614
00:31:43,750 --> 00:31:47,410
of a good society,
it cannot be done without God.

615
00:31:47,740 --> 00:31:48,573
It will,
it will,

616
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:52,780
it will be an utter failure.
And the failure in Europe,

617
00:31:52,840 --> 00:31:55,260
Europe is a failing society.
It,

618
00:31:55,261 --> 00:31:56,094
it,
it because it doesn't stand up for 

619
00:31:58,001 --> 00:31:59,290
anything.
It stands for nothing.

620
00:31:59,680 --> 00:32:00,513
Europe's stands for nothing except for 
feeling good about its own morality for 

621
00:32:04,751 --> 00:32:05,830
it's socialism,
for,

622
00:32:06,070 --> 00:32:07,290
you know,
uh,

623
00:32:07,870 --> 00:32:09,070
we'll,
we'll take care of,

624
00:32:09,071 --> 00:32:09,904
of the,
of everybody with a safety net that we 

625
00:32:11,381 --> 00:32:12,250
can pay for.

626
00:32:12,370 --> 00:32:15,650
So we'll bring in millions of Muslims 
who will a decrease,

627
00:32:15,651 --> 00:32:19,880
denies a and D Westernized Society and 
there will be no Europe in,

628
00:32:20,260 --> 00:32:21,520
in 20,
40 years.

629
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:22,593
That's what's happening.
America actually cares about retaining 

630
00:32:25,901 --> 00:32:29,030
the Judeo Christian bases because it 
knows what,

631
00:32:29,060 --> 00:32:32,500
what George Washington said in his 
farewell address,

632
00:32:32,790 --> 00:32:35,260
you or,
or was it the second inaugural?

633
00:32:35,261 --> 00:32:37,690
No second year old is Lincoln.
But what he said,

634
00:32:37,691 --> 00:32:42,600
I guess the farewell address.
Anybody who thinks that a,

635
00:32:42,680 --> 00:32:47,680
you can have a survival of morality 
without religion is thinking foolishly,

636
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:51,290
and this guy was no fundamentalist.
Uh,

637
00:32:51,291 --> 00:32:52,124
but,
but the,

638
00:32:52,620 --> 00:32:56,120
the founders understood no garden of 
liberty.

639
00:32:56,330 --> 00:32:58,610
No God,
no small government,

640
00:32:58,611 --> 00:33:00,560
no god,
no good and evil.

641
00:33:00,800 --> 00:33:02,510
So yes,
the people like you,

642
00:33:02,511 --> 00:33:04,310
I have no doubt that you're a good pr.
I mean,

643
00:33:04,380 --> 00:33:06,710
I'm not the of a little louder.
I don't know.

644
00:33:06,711 --> 00:33:08,470
I don't even have a little doubt.
You,

645
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:11,160
you strike me as for a whole host of 
reasons,

646
00:33:11,161 --> 00:33:14,630
a very decent and an inquiring mind and 
so on.

647
00:33:15,080 --> 00:33:19,550
I know that exists,
but you weren't the product of the Judeo

648
00:33:19,550 --> 00:33:22,430
Christian system that you no longer hold
by.

649
00:33:22,820 --> 00:33:23,653
So my question to you is,
what's going to pass this on to 

650
00:33:26,811 --> 00:33:30,200
generation after generation and it's not
being passed.

651
00:33:30,440 --> 00:33:35,330
The vast majority of kids today,
indeed for the last 25,

652
00:33:35,331 --> 00:33:36,164
30 years,
would save their dog before a human 

653
00:33:39,500 --> 00:33:42,350
because they love their dog and they 
don't love the stranger.

654
00:33:42,800 --> 00:33:43,633
They say it.
They're proudly announced I would save 

655
00:33:45,921 --> 00:33:50,390
my dog because we don't have objective 
morality which says,

656
00:33:50,391 --> 00:33:52,640
man is created in God's image.
Dogs or not,

657
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:56,660
we have subjective morality.
What do you love?

658
00:33:56,780 --> 00:33:57,613
I love my dog.
So this must have put you in a strange 

659
00:34:00,111 --> 00:34:00,944
position with trump though,
because I think out of all of the 

660
00:34:02,811 --> 00:34:05,660
Republicans that you could've chosen,
right?

661
00:34:05,840 --> 00:34:06,673
You certainly could have said Ted Cruz,
you certainly could have said Marco 

662
00:34:09,650 --> 00:34:12,260
Rubio said he probably,
he was my last choice,

663
00:34:12,261 --> 00:34:13,094
but he,
but he's the only one who could have 

664
00:34:14,271 --> 00:34:15,770
defeated the left.
So,

665
00:34:15,860 --> 00:34:16,693
so that concept of defeating that,
that even superseded what supersedes 

666
00:34:20,931 --> 00:34:25,370
everything right now.
The left is so neolistic of force in the

667
00:34:25,371 --> 00:34:26,690
world that,
uh,

668
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:29,180
it,
it almost anything supersedes.

669
00:34:29,270 --> 00:34:30,103
I mean,
there was a level of evil that I 

670
00:34:30,951 --> 00:34:31,784
wouldn't vote for,
obviously a to even to the feet the 

671
00:34:34,641 --> 00:34:36,010
left.
But uh,

672
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:38,960
but there,
there was no such living Republican.

673
00:34:38,990 --> 00:34:40,040
Right?
So for,

674
00:34:40,070 --> 00:34:40,903
let's say a long time fan of yours that 
I'm sure you got emails like this that 

675
00:34:43,371 --> 00:34:44,150
said,
all right,

676
00:34:44,150 --> 00:34:45,440
I know prager.
He's,

677
00:34:45,441 --> 00:34:46,274
he's moral and he's decent and all of 
these things he's voting for a guy are 

678
00:34:49,971 --> 00:34:50,920
now supporting.
Right?

679
00:34:50,930 --> 00:34:51,763
I get that a lot.
He's now supporting a guy who will say 

680
00:34:53,871 --> 00:34:54,860
anything.
He wants tweets.

681
00:34:54,861 --> 00:34:55,694
All this crazy stuff is a narcissist,
but I don't know what is moral 

682
00:34:57,591 --> 00:34:58,071
centuries.
I mean,

683
00:34:58,071 --> 00:35:01,050
that's what I kept saying the entire 
time is I just don't know what the guy,

684
00:35:01,051 --> 00:35:01,884
his moral center is.
I think there's a chance where things 

685
00:35:03,021 --> 00:35:03,854
are going to be great.
Yeah,

686
00:35:04,090 --> 00:35:07,330
I didn't know his moral said.
That's why I said there were two doors,

687
00:35:07,630 --> 00:35:12,270
man eating lie and the Democrat,
maybe a man eating lion.

688
00:35:12,340 --> 00:35:15,280
That's trump.
So between maybe indefinite,

689
00:35:15,281 --> 00:35:16,820
of course I'll vote for maybe.
Right.

690
00:35:16,870 --> 00:35:21,070
So then is this just a completely unique
political situation?

691
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:23,820
Is there anything in your life that you 
can remember?

692
00:35:24,670 --> 00:35:27,360
Uh,
there was an article in one of the major

693
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:28,233
papers today,
I don't know if it was the times or the 

694
00:35:29,710 --> 00:35:31,390
Wall Street Journal,
but one of them,

695
00:35:31,640 --> 00:35:33,580
uh,
about the uniqueness.

696
00:35:33,581 --> 00:35:36,550
This is a whole new episode.
It was like Jackson,

697
00:35:36,610 --> 00:35:40,740
Andrew Jackson transformed the country.
FDR transform the country.

698
00:35:41,010 --> 00:35:43,350
This might be one of those 
transformative moments.

699
00:35:43,351 --> 00:35:44,184
It might be the end of the,
of at least one of the parties as we 

700
00:35:46,051 --> 00:35:46,884
know it.
There are a whole host of things that 

701
00:35:48,031 --> 00:35:49,770
could happen.
I don't know what'll happen.

702
00:35:49,771 --> 00:35:52,230
I do know this though,
that uh,

703
00:35:52,231 --> 00:35:53,064
and I say this to the conservatives who 
call in and are still sort of never 

704
00:35:56,941 --> 00:35:58,260
trumpers.
I said,

705
00:35:58,261 --> 00:36:02,700
if somebody would have given you his 
cabinet list a year ago and said,

706
00:36:02,701 --> 00:36:06,510
we don't know who the nominee will be,
but this will be the cabinet while would

707
00:36:06,511 --> 00:36:07,344
you have said.
And they would have said we would have 

708
00:36:09,271 --> 00:36:10,104
been ecstatic.

709
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:11,450
Right.
So ironically,

710
00:36:11,451 --> 00:36:15,530
he ended up going more conservative,
incorrect in his cabinet then he ran on.

711
00:36:15,590 --> 00:36:16,550
That's correct.
He's got the,

712
00:36:16,820 --> 00:36:17,653
he's got the trump people,
the Manga people are annoyed at him 

713
00:36:19,851 --> 00:36:22,310
about the cabinet and the Conservatives 
are going,

714
00:36:22,430 --> 00:36:23,860
well,
I don't know if the trump people are.

715
00:36:24,340 --> 00:36:25,173
Well,
because I think there's a sense that 

716
00:36:25,671 --> 00:36:27,530
maybe it's a little more,
uh,

717
00:36:27,590 --> 00:36:28,181
no.
Well,

718
00:36:28,181 --> 00:36:33,020
they have their own power sort of are 
the people who were not conservative,

719
00:36:33,021 --> 00:36:36,230
who voted for him don't care who he 
points to cabinet.

720
00:36:36,500 --> 00:36:38,390
They care whether we improves the 
economy.

721
00:36:38,600 --> 00:36:39,433
Do you think there's a danger in just 
the way the cult of personality around 

722
00:36:42,171 --> 00:36:43,004
him that we have a leader,
that it really is superseding logic and 

723
00:36:45,771 --> 00:36:46,604
reason and even if you end up liking 
some of the things and he lowered some 

724
00:36:48,230 --> 00:36:50,960
taxes and we don't get involved in crazy
military things,

725
00:36:51,070 --> 00:36:52,910
do you think just that,
that Culta personality now?

726
00:36:52,911 --> 00:36:53,744
We certainly had it with Obama too.
That was a different way answered my 

727
00:36:56,271 --> 00:36:57,170
question.
Yes,

728
00:36:57,290 --> 00:36:59,340
I answered my question.
Your question.

729
00:36:59,470 --> 00:37:00,303
That's well said.

730
00:37:00,550 --> 00:37:01,383
Yes.
It'll be very difficult to match the 

731
00:37:05,051 --> 00:37:07,570
amount of,
of cultiness around Obama.

732
00:37:08,810 --> 00:37:10,890
So the change,
this is what I mentioned at the,

733
00:37:10,930 --> 00:37:11,763
at the top of the show before you sat 
down that the change Obama came in with 

734
00:37:14,241 --> 00:37:17,300
hope and change in a certain respect.
There wasn't a lot of change.

735
00:37:17,301 --> 00:37:19,860
He did some things.
He changed.

736
00:37:19,870 --> 00:37:20,703
So.
So what are some of the things that he 

737
00:37:22,280 --> 00:37:23,840
changed?
He changed

738
00:37:24,180 --> 00:37:26,210
what,
what percentage of the economy?

739
00:37:26,211 --> 00:37:29,420
His health and he changed that to move 
toward a one,

740
00:37:29,510 --> 00:37:33,110
a one payer economy.
That was a huge change.

741
00:37:33,380 --> 00:37:34,370
Uh,
I think he,

742
00:37:34,460 --> 00:37:36,980
I think everything he changed.
I think he did,

743
00:37:37,220 --> 00:37:38,053
he,
he changed America's role in the world 

744
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:41,720
to being,
becoming a bystander.

745
00:37:42,140 --> 00:37:43,580
You know,
uh,

746
00:37:43,590 --> 00:37:44,423
Assad,
there's a red line in Syria if you use 

747
00:37:46,461 --> 00:37:50,090
chemical biological weapons.
So he uses those weapons.

748
00:37:50,180 --> 00:37:51,740
Nothing happens.
Uh,

749
00:37:51,741 --> 00:37:53,570
so it's a green light to,
we ran,

750
00:37:53,571 --> 00:37:57,260
do whatever you want in Syria.
Russia takes over Crimea.

751
00:37:57,500 --> 00:37:59,360
Gee,
that's really unfortunate.

752
00:37:59,640 --> 00:38:00,500
Uh,
on what?

753
00:38:00,520 --> 00:38:02,810
I still won't arm the Ukrainian 
government.

754
00:38:03,190 --> 00:38:03,991
Uh,
so he,

755
00:38:03,991 --> 00:38:04,824
he,
he is back down in every incident than 

756
00:38:06,531 --> 00:38:07,364
the agreement with Iran.
The only government in the world that 

757
00:38:10,131 --> 00:38:12,770
isn't announced that wishes to commit 
genocide.

758
00:38:13,100 --> 00:38:14,540
I mean,
that's a pretty,

759
00:38:14,541 --> 00:38:16,710
pretty significant.
Uh,

760
00:38:16,730 --> 00:38:19,250
and,
and court is a great Tome Mutek phrase,

761
00:38:19,251 --> 00:38:22,610
those who are kind to the cruel,
be cruel to the kind.

762
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:27,880
So the nicer he got to Iran and unlike 
my and Castro,

763
00:38:28,970 --> 00:38:30,760
the,
the tougher he got onto Tanya,

764
00:38:30,840 --> 00:38:33,950
who,
so this is classic rule of history.

765
00:38:34,080 --> 00:38:38,680
It's a 2000 old from the Talmud.
Those who are kind to the cruel,

766
00:38:38,681 --> 00:38:43,681
be cruel to the kind of Obama and the 
left perfectly encapsulate that vision.

767
00:38:45,010 --> 00:38:49,030
So I suspect I know your answer to this,
but going to Israel for just a second,

768
00:38:49,031 --> 00:38:50,830
you're a big defender of Israel.
I saw your,

769
00:38:50,950 --> 00:38:53,650
I think you did a video before prager u 
about Israel.

770
00:38:53,651 --> 00:38:55,680
Did you do saying that?
That was.

771
00:38:56,260 --> 00:38:57,093
Okay.
So that was even before I knew about 

772
00:38:58,541 --> 00:38:59,790
that was a viral one.
Yeah.

773
00:38:59,980 --> 00:39:02,290
Where you gave,
I thought a very thoughtful,

774
00:39:02,380 --> 00:39:05,320
historically accurate version of what 
the truth is.

775
00:39:05,321 --> 00:39:06,970
And,
and you know the big line I think.

776
00:39:07,030 --> 00:39:07,863
Well let you say that line.
Basically what you say about the other 

777
00:39:10,871 --> 00:39:11,704
side Pid and the headline was yes,
if tomorrow is real announced we are 

778
00:39:16,811 --> 00:39:17,770
fighting no more.

779
00:39:17,770 --> 00:39:18,603
We are disbanding our army,
we are dismantling our armaments a what 

780
00:39:24,411 --> 00:39:28,240
would happen the next day and if the 
Arabs announced,

781
00:39:28,750 --> 00:39:30,640
you know,
we are laying down our arms,

782
00:39:30,641 --> 00:39:31,474
we are fighting Israel no more.
What would happen the next day in that 

783
00:39:33,731 --> 00:39:34,564
scenario,
one of the first scenario they would be 

784
00:39:36,461 --> 00:39:39,100
genocide Israel.
Israelis would be wiped out.

785
00:39:39,130 --> 00:39:39,963
They would be mass murder,
torture and rape in the streets of 

786
00:39:42,521 --> 00:39:44,530
Israel.
The on the other scenario,

787
00:39:44,531 --> 00:39:46,710
there would be peace within a week.
Yeah,

788
00:39:46,870 --> 00:39:48,520
so I,
I basically agree with that.

789
00:39:48,521 --> 00:39:51,580
And so,
so what is the obsession with Israel?

790
00:39:51,581 --> 00:39:52,414
I mean,
as I pointed out the day of the century 

791
00:39:53,660 --> 00:39:54,461
in the world.
Yeah,

792
00:39:54,461 --> 00:39:55,294
the especially the world.
As I pointed out the day of the Kerry 

793
00:39:56,681 --> 00:39:57,514
speech,
I posted a image of the entire Middle 

794
00:40:00,010 --> 00:40:03,120
East with one little orange sliver 
amongst all of this other stuff.

795
00:40:03,490 --> 00:40:04,940
And this thing is tiny.
We,

796
00:40:04,970 --> 00:40:05,803
we're talking about at one point,
I think including the West Bank nine 

797
00:40:08,231 --> 00:40:10,260
miles wide at one point,
you know,

798
00:40:10,330 --> 00:40:12,700
you could have rocky,
they have one international airport,

799
00:40:12,820 --> 00:40:13,653
but one place where gays and atheists 
and Christians and the high and all of 

800
00:40:18,341 --> 00:40:20,290
these people,
it's the only place where you can see an

801
00:40:20,291 --> 00:40:23,980
orthodox Jewish man on a bus sitting 
next to a woman in a hijab.

802
00:40:23,980 --> 00:40:24,813
I mean,
it's the one place in coexistence and 

803
00:40:26,321 --> 00:40:27,154
they're obsessed with it.
And this is where I feel like I've 

804
00:40:28,901 --> 00:40:29,734
completely lost left.
I have tried desperately to bring some 

805
00:40:31,961 --> 00:40:34,060
clarity to this and I don't know that I 
can.

806
00:40:34,320 --> 00:40:35,320
What,
what's the obsession?

807
00:40:35,380 --> 00:40:39,460
What's in the final analysis you have 
really hit,

808
00:40:39,500 --> 00:40:43,240
uh,
my one of my deepest beliefs in life.

809
00:40:43,241 --> 00:40:46,180
And it's a religious belief,
a Jew,

810
00:40:46,181 --> 00:40:51,160
hatred and Israel hatred is Jew hatred,
not criticism of Israel.

811
00:40:51,370 --> 00:40:54,240
Nobody ever.
No one has ever said if you criticize,

812
00:40:54,241 --> 00:40:55,074
is really are an antisemite,
but if you support those who wish to 

813
00:40:57,821 --> 00:41:00,780
destroy Israel,
whether you feel that you're a Jew,

814
00:41:00,781 --> 00:41:03,100
hater or not is irrelevant.
If you say,

815
00:41:03,101 --> 00:41:07,210
I want Italy destroyed,
you can say I'm not anti Italian.

816
00:41:07,570 --> 00:41:10,080
Okay,
so why?

817
00:41:10,420 --> 00:41:15,420
Of all the 200 plus countries on earth 
is only one targeted for destruction.

818
00:41:16,570 --> 00:41:17,403
And by sheer coincidence,
it's the only Jewish country in the 

819
00:41:19,961 --> 00:41:20,710
world.

820
00:41:20,710 --> 00:41:21,543
Why?
Of all the people in the world is only 

821
00:41:23,231 --> 00:41:27,550
one bid targeted for true genocide.
We speak genocide here,

822
00:41:27,551 --> 00:41:29,470
genocide,
the genocide everywhere.

823
00:41:29,770 --> 00:41:32,890
But the one true genocide take every 
baby.

824
00:41:33,110 --> 00:41:33,943
Every child,
every grandparent who was a Jew and 

825
00:41:36,651 --> 00:41:38,180
gassed them,
slaughter them,

826
00:41:38,210 --> 00:41:39,620
shoot them,
bury them.

827
00:41:40,160 --> 00:41:42,990
Only Jews,
Jew hatred is the own.

828
00:41:43,050 --> 00:41:45,050
I wrote a book on this called why the 
Jews,

829
00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:50,440
Jew hatred is the only hatred that is 
extermination list.

830
00:41:51,560 --> 00:41:52,393
That's very important.
Whites who hated blacks did not wish to 

831
00:41:56,181 --> 00:42:00,560
exterminate all blacks you name,
and it's a terrible hatred.

832
00:42:00,561 --> 00:42:03,290
It's not a defensive it,
but there was no other.

833
00:42:04,190 --> 00:42:05,023
There was a desire to wipe out the Jews 
and the desire to wipe out Israel is 

834
00:42:10,431 --> 00:42:13,850
part of the desire to wipe out the Jews.
And it is,

835
00:42:13,910 --> 00:42:14,743
it is.
It is a reason that I believe in the 

836
00:42:17,481 --> 00:42:21,290
truth ultimately of the biblical 
narrative,

837
00:42:21,320 --> 00:42:23,390
especially the first five books of the 
Torah,

838
00:42:23,800 --> 00:42:27,260
that,
that when God chose the Jews,

839
00:42:27,590 --> 00:42:28,423
this chosen,
this led them to be the world's hated 

840
00:42:30,231 --> 00:42:33,020
people because they ended up the 
conscience of the world.

841
00:42:33,560 --> 00:42:35,630
So is the irony that I think if you 
took,

842
00:42:35,660 --> 00:42:36,493
I think you've talked about this,
I'm sure you have talked about this and 

843
00:42:37,941 --> 00:42:39,020
I think it was one of your books 
actually,

844
00:42:39,140 --> 00:42:42,230
that if you took most Jews in America,
they're totally secular.

845
00:42:42,590 --> 00:42:45,050
They've sorted,
I think most are totally left this.

846
00:42:45,330 --> 00:42:47,520
So I think Ben Shapiro is Trey Trey,
he's.

847
00:42:47,690 --> 00:42:48,570
He says,
uh,

848
00:42:48,710 --> 00:42:51,370
they've traded their religiosity for 
lefties.

849
00:42:52,410 --> 00:42:53,360
I think.
Ben Shapiro.

850
00:42:53,430 --> 00:42:56,400
Oh yeah.
I've been saying it's in spending,

851
00:42:56,960 --> 00:43:00,590
but not from valley before.
I was born.

852
00:43:00,620 --> 00:43:01,453
Yeah,
but that's,

853
00:43:01,580 --> 00:43:02,413
but that is exactly right.
And Ben is right and whoever says it is 

854
00:43:04,851 --> 00:43:05,990
right.
The,

855
00:43:06,080 --> 00:43:08,240
uh,
the Jews,

856
00:43:08,630 --> 00:43:10,460
Jew,
Jews are.

857
00:43:10,670 --> 00:43:15,670
The way I put is Jews are too isms want.
Italians are to operas it.

858
00:43:17,810 --> 00:43:19,380
Jews.
Think about it.

859
00:43:19,400 --> 00:43:24,400
Every ism Jews either created or lead 
the except for Nazis,

860
00:43:26,260 --> 00:43:27,500
communism,
humanism,

861
00:43:27,501 --> 00:43:29,320
socialism,
live cap cap.

862
00:43:29,330 --> 00:43:29,980
Well,
not.

863
00:43:29,980 --> 00:43:30,510
Yeah.
All right,

864
00:43:30,510 --> 00:43:32,720
fine.
But that's not an ideology.

865
00:43:32,721 --> 00:43:34,340
That's just the,
an economic way.

866
00:43:34,640 --> 00:43:35,550
Uh,
you know,

867
00:43:35,551 --> 00:43:36,770
uh,
environmentalism,

868
00:43:36,771 --> 00:43:38,720
feminism,
betty free.

869
00:43:38,721 --> 00:43:39,560
Dan,
you know,

870
00:43:39,561 --> 00:43:39,911
you,
you,

871
00:43:39,911 --> 00:43:41,900
you name it.
Trotsky.

872
00:43:42,560 --> 00:43:46,190
Three of the possible successors to 
Lennon at pamas death.

873
00:43:46,191 --> 00:43:48,230
Three of the five.
There were only five people.

874
00:43:48,620 --> 00:43:50,660
Three of the three of them commented,
synovium,

875
00:43:50,810 --> 00:43:53,230
and Trotsky would choose Jews Bukhara 
and install them.

876
00:43:53,240 --> 00:43:54,070
We're not Jewish.

877
00:43:54,070 --> 00:43:55,320
So in an odd way,
the Laurent,

878
00:43:55,390 --> 00:44:00,220
you making an argument against religion 
here because if the idea is that,

879
00:44:00,221 --> 00:44:01,930
well,
this was the chosen group.

880
00:44:01,931 --> 00:44:02,970
And look what you know as,
as,

881
00:44:02,980 --> 00:44:03,813
what's his name?
Ms [inaudible] said in fiddler on the 

882
00:44:04,991 --> 00:44:05,824
roof.
So I wish we had been chosen for 

883
00:44:06,401 --> 00:44:07,234
something else.
Right?

884
00:44:07,260 --> 00:44:08,093
Well,
isn't that actually an argument against 

885
00:44:09,641 --> 00:44:12,040
religion because the Jews were sort of 
set up,

886
00:44:12,041 --> 00:44:14,670
whether it's,
whether it's divine or manmade,

887
00:44:14,750 --> 00:44:15,583
that there was a setup that guess what,
you're going to be exterminated and 

888
00:44:17,621 --> 00:44:20,140
kicked across the world.
And so if you would have asked,

889
00:44:20,140 --> 00:44:20,973
ask me

890
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:26,000
if you would have a fight had been at 
Sinai and I would have been told this is

891
00:44:26,611 --> 00:44:29,820
what's going to happen to the Jews 
because they are chosen.

892
00:44:30,150 --> 00:44:31,800
I would have to.
God,

893
00:44:32,070 --> 00:44:33,450
thanks.
But no thanks.

894
00:44:33,990 --> 00:44:35,700
Have you been to Sinai?
Yes,

895
00:44:35,760 --> 00:44:38,110
it is ironic.
Yeah.

896
00:44:38,570 --> 00:44:41,940
Did you have any religious?
Because I'm not,

897
00:44:42,650 --> 00:44:47,650
that's not the stuff.
I am moved by the text more than I am by

898
00:44:48,001 --> 00:44:48,720
any,
uh,

899
00:44:48,720 --> 00:44:50,070
physical place.
So,

900
00:44:50,580 --> 00:44:52,410
uh,
but I'm atypical in that way.

901
00:44:52,411 --> 00:44:54,170
I don't get old that choked up at,
uh,

902
00:44:54,180 --> 00:44:57,720
at any monument or stuff like that.
Um,

903
00:44:57,890 --> 00:44:58,371
all right.
So,

904
00:44:58,371 --> 00:45:00,450
so one more thing on this and then we'll
move to a couple of other issues.

905
00:45:00,740 --> 00:45:01,573
Um,
what do you think about also that the 

906
00:45:03,240 --> 00:45:07,620
story has been lost here?
What the actual history of the land is.

907
00:45:07,621 --> 00:45:11,890
That's another thing that I try to 
explain to people that you know,

908
00:45:11,970 --> 00:45:12,803
you talk about the partition plan,
you talked about the fact that he was 

909
00:45:14,350 --> 00:45:15,000
British.

910
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:16,890
You're talking about that it was 
actually part of the Ottoman Empire.

911
00:45:16,891 --> 00:45:18,960
Before that there were no people called 
the Palestinian people,

912
00:45:18,961 --> 00:45:19,794
which people will say you're racist.
For they were Arabs there in a notice 

913
00:45:23,550 --> 00:45:26,550
that they were also Jews Palestinian in 
1930.

914
00:45:26,551 --> 00:45:29,670
The people notice as Palestinians were 
the Jews and there were boys.

915
00:45:29,730 --> 00:45:33,000
I mean you can look at New York Times 
articles where the Arabs were boycotting

916
00:45:33,001 --> 00:45:35,790
Palestine because it's so.
All of this stuff.

917
00:45:35,820 --> 00:45:36,653
Even when I say it,
I feel like I'm already unleashing a 

918
00:45:38,371 --> 00:45:39,204
torrent of hate running,
but how do you beat people that won't 

919
00:45:42,241 --> 00:45:43,860
accept history?
How do you either.

920
00:45:43,950 --> 00:45:48,390
There is only in this whole honesty,
there really is no way what we have.

921
00:45:48,440 --> 00:45:51,420
What my,
my dream with prager university,

922
00:45:51,421 --> 00:45:52,254
let's say,
or my radio show or anything that I do 

923
00:45:53,431 --> 00:45:58,290
publicly,
is to say what is true and I know that a

924
00:45:58,291 --> 00:46:02,370
certain percentage of people will say,
wow,

925
00:46:02,400 --> 00:46:03,360
I didn't know that.

926
00:46:04,080 --> 00:46:07,080
Where is the majority will say,
Oh,

927
00:46:07,200 --> 00:46:11,790
you are a coal you a bad name,
and that's what.

928
00:46:11,880 --> 00:46:16,050
So you can only hope that the number of 
people who will say,

929
00:46:16,380 --> 00:46:17,213
oh,
I didn't know that I'm gonna change my 

930
00:46:18,781 --> 00:46:23,250
mind is greater than you imagined it 
would be.

931
00:46:23,680 --> 00:46:24,513
That's the only hope,
but it's dispiriting that facts don't 

932
00:46:28,651 --> 00:46:30,210
matter.
Hey,

933
00:46:31,020 --> 00:46:34,530
a Hitler said Jesus was an Ra and not a 
Jew,

934
00:46:35,010 --> 00:46:37,710
and the Palestinians say he was a 
Palestinian,

935
00:46:37,711 --> 00:46:38,550
not a Jew.
Right.

936
00:46:39,160 --> 00:46:44,090
The idea is it's beyond law.
Yeah.

937
00:46:44,100 --> 00:46:45,870
It's,
it's entering a new realm.

938
00:46:46,050 --> 00:46:48,270
Yeah.
And so do you think were post-truth?

939
00:46:48,300 --> 00:46:49,133
Now that seems to be the new truth is 
coming from the enemies of Western 

940
00:46:54,211 --> 00:46:55,044
liberalism.
It's not coming from the right who was 

941
00:46:57,631 --> 00:46:58,464
protecting western liberalism.
It's coming from the left and from the 

942
00:47:01,141 --> 00:47:03,420
Islamists.
That's the irony.

943
00:47:03,690 --> 00:47:05,790
So let's critique the right a little 
bit.

944
00:47:05,790 --> 00:47:07,260
You've got to have some critiques of the
right.

945
00:47:07,261 --> 00:47:08,094
Right.
I don't have that many critiques of the 

946
00:47:10,100 --> 00:47:12,210
Writing Center that they don't know how 
to fight.

947
00:47:13,890 --> 00:47:15,140
So then they,
they,

948
00:47:15,141 --> 00:47:16,170
they don't,
they don't,

949
00:47:16,200 --> 00:47:18,090
they don't know what they stand for.
They forgot.

950
00:47:18,510 --> 00:47:19,343
It's like,
it's like the choir forgot it's 

951
00:47:21,481 --> 00:47:24,930
melodies,
but by and large I have to say,

952
00:47:24,931 --> 00:47:27,060
and I never thought I would have said 
this is a kid,

953
00:47:27,061 --> 00:47:29,560
you know,
growing up as a Jew in New York,

954
00:47:30,190 --> 00:47:33,130
but the people on the right that I have 
met,

955
00:47:33,910 --> 00:47:34,743
uh,
of course there are exceptions because 

956
00:47:36,171 --> 00:47:37,004
they were disgusting people on the right
and they're beautiful people on the 

957
00:47:39,281 --> 00:47:41,260
left.
But by and large,

958
00:47:41,261 --> 00:47:42,094
the people on the right that I have met 
have been kind and decent and loving 

959
00:47:46,331 --> 00:47:47,170
and,
you know,

960
00:47:47,171 --> 00:47:51,380
they give more charity.
They adopt more kids from a I,

961
00:47:51,410 --> 00:47:54,580
I don't mean just general adoption 
that's left and right,

962
00:47:54,581 --> 00:47:55,450
but they adopt.

963
00:47:55,840 --> 00:47:59,490
I was just with a right wing guy who,
uh,

964
00:48:00,200 --> 00:48:01,033
uh,
he and his wife had two biological 

965
00:48:02,471 --> 00:48:07,471
children and then they adopted two more 
children from China,

966
00:48:08,650 --> 00:48:09,483
not newborns.
Kids with terrible illnesses that is 

967
00:48:14,860 --> 00:48:19,000
overwhelmingly done by religious 
Christians in America.

968
00:48:19,390 --> 00:48:23,830
It's not been done by Europeans.
It's not done by secular in America.

969
00:48:24,850 --> 00:48:26,980
Of course.
I know there are exceptions,

970
00:48:27,040 --> 00:48:29,470
but overwhelmingly a tiring having to 
say that all the time.

971
00:48:29,471 --> 00:48:31,230
I feel the same way.
Two billion it,

972
00:48:31,231 --> 00:48:33,330
it drives me crazy cause then you,
you know,

973
00:48:33,331 --> 00:48:37,720
you see yourself quoted and know you,
so you have to make,

974
00:48:38,080 --> 00:48:38,913
you know,
it's like clarification for the foolish 

975
00:48:41,380 --> 00:48:42,790
but,
but in any event,

976
00:48:44,530 --> 00:48:46,690
I've just been touched by the.
I'm a Jew,

977
00:48:46,691 --> 00:48:51,070
I have been overwhelmed by the kindness 
of so many evangelical Christians.

978
00:48:51,130 --> 00:48:52,030
So,
so real quick,

979
00:48:52,031 --> 00:48:53,770
let's just talk about what you just 
mentioned there.

980
00:48:53,771 --> 00:48:54,604
Just sort of being a public person where
you have to measure your words all the 

981
00:48:56,981 --> 00:48:57,550
time.

982
00:48:57,550 --> 00:48:58,383
Was it always like this,
like when you were doing radio 30 years 

983
00:49:00,071 --> 00:49:00,904
ago,
did you feel that you had to constantly 

984
00:49:02,710 --> 00:49:05,410
qualify everything,
every adjective.

985
00:49:05,440 --> 00:49:10,440
There was no internet to play.
Everything you've said and you know,

986
00:49:10,630 --> 00:49:14,350
take it out of context or whatever.
But as soon as it developed,

987
00:49:14,351 --> 00:49:19,351
I did take an even earlier than that.
I did start with a motto in my brain,

988
00:49:22,930 --> 00:49:27,220
be sure that no one sentence can kill 
you.

989
00:49:27,970 --> 00:49:28,803
And I am very,
very careful about how I speak and I'm 

990
00:49:34,361 --> 00:49:35,194
amazed that in 33 years,
tens of thousands of hours of live is 

991
00:49:40,290 --> 00:49:41,620
not.
You can't do anything.

992
00:49:41,621 --> 00:49:43,720
It's live radio.
They,

993
00:49:43,721 --> 00:49:48,430
I have never been caught on a,
on something that could hang me.

994
00:49:48,520 --> 00:49:50,520
You just jinxed yourself horribly.
Did you see?

995
00:49:51,630 --> 00:49:54,660
I'm very,
I'm very scientific superstition.

996
00:49:55,310 --> 00:49:56,460
Um,
do,

997
00:49:56,500 --> 00:49:59,700
do you think that there's just a certain
amount of mental space that,

998
00:49:59,710 --> 00:50:00,543
that takes up even having to think about
it because that's what I talk about 

999
00:50:02,621 --> 00:50:04,780
Swat.
One of the reasons I leave the show,

1000
00:50:04,840 --> 00:50:06,610
uh,
like I just went through,

1001
00:50:06,830 --> 00:50:07,840
I,
I am,

1002
00:50:07,930 --> 00:50:12,930
I work out harder in the show than with 
my trainer at the gym just to see,

1003
00:50:14,470 --> 00:50:18,280
just to sort of contain the potential 
errors.

1004
00:50:18,310 --> 00:50:22,420
It's a chess game if it's a three hour 
grandmaster chess game,

1005
00:50:22,570 --> 00:50:23,403
and I suspect you would argue that all 
of that has to do again with the left 

1006
00:50:26,711 --> 00:50:28,160
and the buzzword because

1007
00:50:28,160 --> 00:50:29,990
they pinned everybody into it.
Look,

1008
00:50:29,991 --> 00:50:30,650
I wrote it

1009
00:50:30,650 --> 00:50:31,483
piece every so often I write pieces that
are nothing to do with politics or 

1010
00:50:37,171 --> 00:50:40,440
religion or anything but have to do with
the private sphere.

1011
00:50:40,441 --> 00:50:44,430
So I wrote a piece about eight years 
ago.

1012
00:50:44,431 --> 00:50:49,431
My syndicated column was a when a,
when a wife is not in the mood,

1013
00:50:52,770 --> 00:50:54,330
obviously for sex.
I got it.

1014
00:50:54,420 --> 00:50:56,160
So,
uh,

1015
00:50:56,880 --> 00:51:01,440
my argument is that if you love your 
husband,

1016
00:51:01,470 --> 00:51:02,303
if you have a loving marriage,
he's a good man and knowing how 

1017
00:51:05,041 --> 00:51:09,630
important sex is to him,
that even if you're not in the mood,

1018
00:51:10,830 --> 00:51:15,830
why not give it a try because we can't 
be guided by moods.

1019
00:51:16,500 --> 00:51:17,350
It's,
you know,

1020
00:51:17,550 --> 00:51:18,383
and,
and I wrote what if you're not in the 

1021
00:51:19,591 --> 00:51:22,200
mood to go to work,
but you know,

1022
00:51:22,290 --> 00:51:24,150
it's important.
You have to go to war.

1023
00:51:26,010 --> 00:51:29,410
So guess walk to the daily Co's,
they,

1024
00:51:29,460 --> 00:51:32,960
they read my piece and the daily 
headlines,

1025
00:51:33,510 --> 00:51:35,790
prager advocates,
marital rape.

1026
00:51:38,600 --> 00:51:40,700
And then what do you do?
Do you spend any time trying to clean it

1027
00:51:40,701 --> 00:51:41,534
up or do you do

1028
00:51:42,150 --> 00:51:45,480
about possible to clean up the left?
However,

1029
00:51:45,540 --> 00:51:47,340
I will just say,
just for the record,

1030
00:51:47,370 --> 00:51:48,203
yeah,
there was a man at the daily Co's who 

1031
00:51:49,921 --> 00:51:52,650
writes the road with the next issue or 
whatever.

1032
00:51:52,710 --> 00:51:54,480
Next day,
next week.

1033
00:51:55,290 --> 00:51:56,990
I can't stand dennis,
prager,

1034
00:51:56,991 --> 00:51:57,870
rees,
right wing.

1035
00:51:57,871 --> 00:51:59,670
I can't stand them.
I want to make it clear.

1036
00:51:59,671 --> 00:52:00,970
I can stand them.
Did I say

1037
00:52:00,990 --> 00:52:04,560
can stand there and then says,
but give me a break.

1038
00:52:04,590 --> 00:52:05,423
The guy did not advocate marital rape,
so what does that say about just the 

1039
00:52:08,701 --> 00:52:11,600
state of affairs in terms of the 
Internet then because I'm.

1040
00:52:11,601 --> 00:52:12,434
I'm very enthused by the fact that I do 
this show on the Internet and I can do 

1041
00:52:15,301 --> 00:52:17,850
whatever I want and say we've got to 
end.

1042
00:52:17,851 --> 00:52:18,684
The barrier to entry is low,
which is getting a lot of great people 

1043
00:52:20,551 --> 00:52:21,300
involved.
Right.

1044
00:52:21,300 --> 00:52:23,970
That comes with a whole series of 
problems because anyone can get in,

1045
00:52:24,480 --> 00:52:25,313
any idiot can put on a suit and sit at a
desk and pretend they know what they're 

1046
00:52:27,691 --> 00:52:28,860
talking about.
So huge problems,

1047
00:52:29,250 --> 00:52:32,130
but when you think about just that 
general state of that,

1048
00:52:32,131 --> 00:52:34,500
our media,
nobody trusts anybody anymore.

1049
00:52:34,900 --> 00:52:35,733
They.
Well,

1050
00:52:35,790 --> 00:52:38,940
that sort of trick is to learn who mia 
can trust.

1051
00:52:38,941 --> 00:52:39,640
Yeah,

1052
00:52:39,640 --> 00:52:41,980
but it's not all that easy.
That's true.

1053
00:52:42,010 --> 00:52:44,560
That's why.
Look in the final analysis,

1054
00:52:44,561 --> 00:52:49,561
I always say credibility is your 
greatest source of power.

1055
00:52:50,620 --> 00:52:55,120
The A and I have taken that very 
seriously.

1056
00:52:55,420 --> 00:52:59,740
I don't take sponsors that I can 
personally endorse A.

1057
00:52:59,740 --> 00:53:00,573
I said,
I say no to a lot of sponsors because 

1058
00:53:02,060 --> 00:53:04,810
like I'll just give you an example.
I mean,

1059
00:53:04,811 --> 00:53:07,990
I hope I'm not hurting any sponsor here,
but uh,

1060
00:53:08,050 --> 00:53:11,890
we're fan funded so you're right,
but I'm not a sponsored funded.

1061
00:53:12,400 --> 00:53:13,870
But uh,
I was asked,

1062
00:53:13,871 --> 00:53:14,770
I was asked,
yes,

1063
00:53:14,771 --> 00:53:19,300
he was a perfect example.
I was asked to advertise your mattress,

1064
00:53:20,020 --> 00:53:22,960
a fine mattress I might add,
but I,

1065
00:53:23,380 --> 00:53:24,190
I,
I,

1066
00:53:24,190 --> 00:53:25,023
I believe that I have the greatest 
mattress in the world which I currently 

1067
00:53:30,150 --> 00:53:30,983
do sleep on and I can't therefore say 
this is the mattress I sleep on even 

1068
00:53:36,661 --> 00:53:38,370
though they'll send me a free mattress.

1069
00:53:38,910 --> 00:53:41,730
It doesn't matter to me.
And I told them that.

1070
00:53:42,030 --> 00:53:46,020
I said I will happily say it's a fine 
mattress,

1071
00:53:46,021 --> 00:53:49,320
but I will not say it's the best and I 
will not say I sleep on it.

1072
00:53:50,010 --> 00:53:53,790
So I'm very,
very careful about credibility,

1073
00:53:54,150 --> 00:53:56,670
but it's hard to know whom,
whom you can trust.

1074
00:53:56,970 --> 00:53:57,803
Part of it is whom,
and you have to know a lot certain 

1075
00:54:01,201 --> 00:54:04,430
things should strike you at the outset 
as is,

1076
00:54:04,470 --> 00:54:06,870
that's,
that's a little too bizarre to be real.

1077
00:54:07,020 --> 00:54:09,150
And then you've got to verify it.
Yeah.

1078
00:54:09,570 --> 00:54:10,403
What do you make of just how people are 
being funded by all sorts of crazy 

1079
00:54:14,371 --> 00:54:15,510
things right now.
So you know,

1080
00:54:15,511 --> 00:54:18,450
like Pierre Omidyar finds Glenn 
Greenwald's intercept.

1081
00:54:18,660 --> 00:54:20,790
I'm sure you probably don't love that 
site roar,

1082
00:54:20,820 --> 00:54:21,653
you know,
whoever's funding salon or Al Jazeera 

1083
00:54:23,700 --> 00:54:25,750
funds the young Turks or you know,
they have,

1084
00:54:25,780 --> 00:54:29,100
which is funded by part of the 
government of Qatar or any of this stuff

1085
00:54:29,130 --> 00:54:29,963
that,
that's another problem we have that now 

1086
00:54:31,440 --> 00:54:33,390
we don't know where money's coming from 
with everybody.

1087
00:54:33,390 --> 00:54:34,980
Like just everything has been open to 
it.

1088
00:54:35,070 --> 00:54:35,903
This is a real problem because 
transparency is not the answer either 

1089
00:54:39,360 --> 00:54:42,380
because as we found out in America,
and uh,

1090
00:54:42,390 --> 00:54:43,223
and uh,
Kimberly Strassel of the Wall Street 

1091
00:54:45,390 --> 00:54:47,400
Journal wrote a very powerful book on 
this.

1092
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:48,833
The transparency issue has given the 
left a way to ruin the law wives of 

1093
00:54:55,531 --> 00:54:58,470
funders,
of conservative foundations,

1094
00:54:59,130 --> 00:55:01,740
which we don't do the boycott their 
houses,

1095
00:55:02,210 --> 00:55:04,830
uh,
announce publicly.

1096
00:55:04,831 --> 00:55:08,760
These are haters and people don't want 
that misery in their lives.

1097
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:12,060
That's the reason the left wants 
transparency of donors.

1098
00:55:12,270 --> 00:55:13,103
So it's a very complex question,
even though they take plenty of money 

1099
00:55:15,301 --> 00:55:17,820
from Soros and a whole series of other 
things.

1100
00:55:18,040 --> 00:55:19,770
Also,
I think they've partly learned that this

1101
00:55:19,771 --> 00:55:23,340
stuff doesn't work because even when 
Kellogg's just a couple of weeks ago,

1102
00:55:23,341 --> 00:55:26,520
or was it two months ago or so?
The thing with Breitbart.

1103
00:55:26,521 --> 00:55:27,960
Well then what happened while they're 
breitbart?

1104
00:55:27,960 --> 00:55:29,100
People stopped eating.
Kellogg's.

1105
00:55:29,101 --> 00:55:29,970
I mean,
yeah,

1106
00:55:30,030 --> 00:55:30,511
but we'll,
we'll,

1107
00:55:30,511 --> 00:55:32,670
we've come into a place where companies 
think they have to.

1108
00:55:32,700 --> 00:55:35,400
Well,
the political has also left created.

1109
00:55:35,460 --> 00:55:38,590
I don't care.
I don't care about if,

1110
00:55:38,670 --> 00:55:39,870
if,
if a company.

1111
00:55:39,930 --> 00:55:42,120
Look I.
This is my perfect example,

1112
00:55:42,900 --> 00:55:45,210
Ben and Jerry's ice cream.
Ben and Jerry,

1113
00:55:45,780 --> 00:55:48,720
if you go left and Ben and Jerry,
you're in London territory,

1114
00:55:48,990 --> 00:55:49,823
right?
I eat Ben and Jerry ice cream because I 

1115
00:55:52,321 --> 00:55:53,154
don't believe that the free market 
should allow me to boycott based on 

1116
00:55:56,671 --> 00:56:00,540
their ideology.
But that's not what the left believes.

1117
00:56:00,820 --> 00:56:01,510
You,
you,

1118
00:56:01,510 --> 00:56:03,420
uh,
you supported trump.

1119
00:56:03,660 --> 00:56:07,260
We want you to be bankrupt.
That's how they think.

1120
00:56:07,650 --> 00:56:11,400
We will ruin your company.
So you,

1121
00:56:12,150 --> 00:56:15,360
while I'm sure you do not like any of 
the ideas of Bernie Sanders,

1122
00:56:15,361 --> 00:56:16,890
they loved Bernie Sanders,
but you said,

1123
00:56:17,040 --> 00:56:18,780
I liked their ice cream.
I'm just going to eat their ice cream.

1124
00:56:19,290 --> 00:56:20,460
Basically.
That's my belief.

1125
00:56:20,850 --> 00:56:23,100
And,
and you can let it be at that and not.

1126
00:56:23,380 --> 00:56:24,610
Well,
that's the ideal.

1127
00:56:24,611 --> 00:56:27,970
That's was the American ideal.
The left has made that impossible.

1128
00:56:28,240 --> 00:56:32,830
The left is so constantly boycotting.
Anyone they differ with.

1129
00:56:33,160 --> 00:56:33,993
I mean,
why was it,

1130
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:35,050
you know,
chick filet,

1131
00:56:35,051 --> 00:56:37,630
the guy believes that marriage should be
defined as male,

1132
00:56:37,631 --> 00:56:40,000
female and he should be put out of 
phase,

1133
00:56:40,060 --> 00:56:43,840
not allowed in New York and Chicago.
I mean that's an absurdity.

1134
00:56:44,360 --> 00:56:48,760
If the guy advocate same sex marriage,
would I not eat his ice cream?

1135
00:56:48,761 --> 00:56:50,830
I'm a conservative religious 
conservative.

1136
00:56:51,270 --> 00:56:52,510
So what?
Well that

1137
00:56:53,060 --> 00:56:56,110
such virtue signaling to.
I remember during that whole chick filet

1138
00:56:56,150 --> 00:57:00,500
thing and I was on o'reilly arguing 
about chick filet and then shortly after

1139
00:57:00,501 --> 00:57:01,334
that I was on the young Turks,
which is a progressive network and 

1140
00:57:03,261 --> 00:57:04,094
they're screaming about chick fil a the 
whole time I'm openly gay and I worked 

1141
00:57:06,651 --> 00:57:08,150
there.
I didn't care that much actually.

1142
00:57:08,151 --> 00:57:08,984
I just thought this is one of these 
things that were just outraged about 

1143
00:57:10,911 --> 00:57:11,744
whatever.
A guy walked into the production 

1144
00:57:12,741 --> 00:57:13,980
meeting,
eating chick filet,

1145
00:57:14,330 --> 00:57:16,190
and I thought if anyone.
I mean guys,

1146
00:57:16,550 --> 00:57:17,383
I don't really care,
but like you're out there screaming 

1147
00:57:19,401 --> 00:57:21,980
about chick filet and here you are 
eating chick fil a way.

1148
00:57:22,190 --> 00:57:23,023
So that also shows sort of just like a 
general inconsistent is that everybody 

1149
00:57:25,341 --> 00:57:26,480
has across the board probably.

1150
00:57:26,980 --> 00:57:27,813
Right.
But I don't think the right boycotts 

1151
00:57:30,970 --> 00:57:31,803
with,
with,

1152
00:57:32,190 --> 00:57:35,950
uh,
with the instinct that the left does.

1153
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:38,110
I mean,
I can't even think of an analogy.

1154
00:57:38,620 --> 00:57:41,140
It's just you take a position we don't 
like,

1155
00:57:41,141 --> 00:57:41,974
we want you out of business.
Oddly Ben and Jerry's or big Israel 

1156
00:57:44,201 --> 00:57:45,034
supporters,
are they,

1157
00:57:45,130 --> 00:57:47,050
they're big walk.
Are they big supporters of Israel?

1158
00:57:47,051 --> 00:57:48,730
They have a couple of accounts there.
I think so.

1159
00:57:48,980 --> 00:57:51,640
So they've confused.
That's fascinating.

1160
00:57:51,650 --> 00:57:52,510
Yeah.
Um,

1161
00:57:52,520 --> 00:57:53,201
all right,
so let's just,

1162
00:57:53,201 --> 00:57:54,220
let's just knock out a couple

1163
00:57:54,220 --> 00:57:56,850
bull other issues.
Let's just talk about hot topics.

1164
00:57:56,880 --> 00:57:58,700
So gay marriage,
uh,

1165
00:57:58,780 --> 00:58:03,100
as a man that I sent you don't govern by
the Bible.

1166
00:58:03,101 --> 00:58:04,720
That's sort of what you were saying 
earlier.

1167
00:58:05,010 --> 00:58:06,490
Um,
but I don't think

1168
00:58:07,250 --> 00:58:09,320
values come from your values come from 
the Bible,

1169
00:58:09,321 --> 00:58:11,480
but you're not governing.
Well,

1170
00:58:11,481 --> 00:58:12,470
yes and no.
I mean,

1171
00:58:12,530 --> 00:58:16,490
the Bible says do not murder governing,
you know,

1172
00:58:16,540 --> 00:58:18,160
it's a tough call,
but,

1173
00:58:18,170 --> 00:58:21,050
but if the Bible didn't exist,
I'm guessing the Dennis prager would not

1174
00:58:21,051 --> 00:58:22,280
be a murderer,
correct.

1175
00:58:22,700 --> 00:58:23,240
That.
No,

1176
00:58:23,240 --> 00:58:24,020
that's.
Well,

1177
00:58:24,020 --> 00:58:26,990
you're right.
But I'm not sure that society would have

1178
00:58:26,991 --> 00:58:27,824
created much,
do not murder emphasis of the toughest 

1179
00:58:32,421 --> 00:58:36,770
group for the Catholic Church to convert
with a Germanic tribes of Europe because

1180
00:58:36,771 --> 00:58:37,604
they didn't buy the notion of the 10 
commandments and specifically do not 

1181
00:58:40,491 --> 00:58:41,870
kill,
do not murder,

1182
00:58:41,871 --> 00:58:44,180
which is really what it says.
Because they said,

1183
00:58:44,181 --> 00:58:47,000
what are you nuts?
If you're stronger,

1184
00:58:47,001 --> 00:58:49,760
you kill.
And there's no argument against that.

1185
00:58:50,540 --> 00:58:51,590
Only if you say,
well,

1186
00:58:51,620 --> 00:58:52,453
excuse me.
The creator of the universe says it's 

1187
00:58:54,381 --> 00:58:55,550
wrong.
Woo.

1188
00:58:55,820 --> 00:58:57,290
Yeah.
But other than that,

1189
00:58:57,560 --> 00:58:58,940
it's not necessarily rolling.

1190
00:58:59,090 --> 00:59:02,900
So I don't know what I would think if I 
had not been affected by,

1191
00:59:02,960 --> 00:59:03,880
by,
uh,

1192
00:59:04,700 --> 00:59:07,100
2000,
3000 years of the Bible.

1193
00:59:07,101 --> 00:59:10,520
I don't know the answer to that,
but I will be honest to this.

1194
00:59:10,580 --> 00:59:11,180
Uh,
the,

1195
00:59:11,180 --> 00:59:12,660
uh,
so I'm,

1196
00:59:12,661 --> 00:59:15,200
I'm sort of setting myself up to be 
challenged here,

1197
00:59:15,201 --> 00:59:20,201
but it's okay if the Bible said nothing 
about homosexuality,

1198
00:59:23,350 --> 00:59:25,670
the,
the odds are,

1199
00:59:27,050 --> 00:59:27,561
well,
no.

1200
00:59:27,561 --> 00:59:28,394
If the Bible said nothing about the 
importance of male female distinction 

1201
00:59:31,940 --> 00:59:33,860
and that's what I need to explain in a 
moment.

1202
00:59:34,640 --> 00:59:35,490
Uh,
I,

1203
00:59:35,570 --> 00:59:38,930
uh,
my heart is with gay marriage.

1204
00:59:39,860 --> 00:59:40,670
Okay.
Uh,

1205
00:59:40,670 --> 00:59:43,760
my wife and I have a number and I don't 
know people mock it,

1206
00:59:43,761 --> 00:59:45,590
but I don't.
Sometimes it's lockable,

1207
00:59:45,591 --> 00:59:49,400
sometimes it isn't,
but we're very close to two gay couples.

1208
00:59:49,401 --> 00:59:52,400
One female,
one male and the females,

1209
00:59:52,401 --> 00:59:55,340
my niece and then her and her wife and 
uh,

1210
00:59:55,670 --> 00:59:56,451
the,
the male,

1211
00:59:56,451 --> 00:59:58,440
their partner,
they didn't get married but they,

1212
00:59:58,580 --> 00:59:59,480
they're like married.

1213
00:59:59,970 --> 01:00:01,760
What's the makeable part there?
No,

1214
01:00:01,860 --> 01:00:02,241
no,
when,

1215
01:00:02,241 --> 01:00:04,200
when anybody says some of my best 
friends,

1216
01:00:06,260 --> 01:00:09,060
but we're so close to these couples that
it's,

1217
01:00:09,061 --> 01:00:09,660
it's,
you know,

1218
01:00:09,660 --> 01:00:11,420
if,
if I really objected,

1219
01:00:11,690 --> 01:00:13,490
it would be hard to be that close.
Right,

1220
01:00:13,491 --> 01:00:14,480
okay.
I mean,

1221
01:00:14,481 --> 01:00:16,340
if my heart,
my heart is with them,

1222
01:00:16,341 --> 01:00:18,290
let's put it this way.
So,

1223
01:00:18,350 --> 01:00:22,670
but my value system warned me,
and this is the key thing on,

1224
01:00:22,671 --> 01:00:24,650
I predicted this from the beginning.
I said,

1225
01:00:24,651 --> 01:00:25,484
the reason that same sex marriage 
troubles me is primarily that it makes 

1226
01:00:30,921 --> 01:00:34,760
the following announcement.
Gender doesn't matter,

1227
01:00:35,780 --> 01:00:36,613
because that is the argument whom the 
gender of whom you married doesn't 

1228
01:00:40,221 --> 01:00:41,054
matter.
That's the fundamental argument of same 

1229
01:00:42,921 --> 01:00:45,560
sex marriage.
So far I'm okay with,

1230
01:00:45,561 --> 01:00:46,150
right?
No,

1231
01:00:46,150 --> 01:00:46,461
no,
no.

1232
01:00:46,461 --> 01:00:48,680
It's really logical what I'm about to 
say.

1233
01:00:48,740 --> 01:00:51,920
This has nothing to do with the Bible.
It will in a moment,

1234
01:00:51,921 --> 01:00:55,580
but it has to still be logical even if 
it's biblical.

1235
01:00:56,060 --> 01:01:01,060
So if gender doesn't matter in marriage 
than gender won't matter,

1236
01:01:03,350 --> 01:01:06,260
period,
you have left the uh,

1237
01:01:06,261 --> 01:01:09,830
the proverbial a Bot.
Is it the horses out of the barn?

1238
01:01:10,550 --> 01:01:13,430
Once you announced gender?
Doesn't matter.

1239
01:01:13,910 --> 01:01:14,870
Well,
by Golly,

1240
01:01:14,871 --> 01:01:15,704
gender doesn't matter.
And now that's exactly what it said on 

1241
01:01:19,611 --> 01:01:22,310
the progressive side.
Gender doesn't matter.

1242
01:01:22,550 --> 01:01:26,240
Do you know that in,
in thousands of schools in America,

1243
01:01:26,241 --> 01:01:27,074
teachers are told,
do not call your elementary school 

1244
01:01:29,721 --> 01:01:30,554
students,
boys and girls call them students 

1245
01:01:33,530 --> 01:01:36,950
because you cannot impose a gender 
identity on them.

1246
01:01:37,190 --> 01:01:42,170
Let them choose their gender identity if
they want one later in life.

1247
01:01:42,350 --> 01:01:45,470
Right?
So I get the slippery slope thing there.

1248
01:01:45,650 --> 01:01:46,483
I get it.
I mean,

1249
01:01:46,650 --> 01:01:47,483
you can look at my twitter,
I mock these people all day long with 

1250
01:01:49,341 --> 01:01:54,341
these ridiculous fried frame it came 
from changing it in marriage.

1251
01:01:55,340 --> 01:01:55,970
Okay.
So that.

1252
01:01:55,970 --> 01:01:56,900
So there's sort of two things there.

1253
01:01:56,900 --> 01:01:57,733
There's the,
there's the original point about gay 

1254
01:01:58,370 --> 01:02:00,470
marriage and then just the slippery 
slope that.

1255
01:02:00,680 --> 01:02:02,420
So,
so let's just separate those two things.

1256
01:02:02,421 --> 01:02:03,254
So in terms of the gay marriage,
my feeling always was I should just be 

1257
01:02:07,161 --> 01:02:09,830
treated equally under the law.
Makes make sense,

1258
01:02:09,860 --> 01:02:10,693
period.
I want to enter a contract with 

1259
01:02:11,480 --> 01:02:13,100
somebody.
It happens to be a man,

1260
01:02:13,130 --> 01:02:14,940
right?
You unedited that same contract with and

1261
01:02:14,950 --> 01:02:19,950
I totally understand that and I,
but I knew going to happen and the price

1262
01:02:21,270 --> 01:02:23,160
is too great.
So I would,

1263
01:02:23,300 --> 01:02:26,040
I would want the gay persons have every 
right.

1264
01:02:26,041 --> 01:02:26,874
And I know this is not the same as 
marriage and I knew every argument that 

1265
01:02:29,151 --> 01:02:33,300
I know every argument against it and 
their sound they are,

1266
01:02:33,580 --> 01:02:37,050
it's to sound arguments against the 
other.

1267
01:02:37,350 --> 01:02:40,470
But if I think macro,
not just micro,

1268
01:02:41,250 --> 01:02:42,083
my concern is not just the individual,
it's for the whole society and I'm 

1269
01:02:47,191 --> 01:02:48,024
afraid the society has,
has chosen wrong in this matter because 

1270
01:02:52,591 --> 01:02:54,810
of the gender doesn't matter issue.

1271
01:02:55,110 --> 01:02:56,610
So.
Okay.

1272
01:02:56,611 --> 01:02:57,444
So basically I sense you don't want to 
say you don't particularly care because 

1273
01:03:01,051 --> 01:03:02,440
you're a caring person,
doesn't,

1274
01:03:02,880 --> 01:03:03,980
it?
Doesn't bother you in,

1275
01:03:03,981 --> 01:03:06,210
in,
in the specifics of your.

1276
01:03:06,211 --> 01:03:07,550
In my home studio.
You were on my,

1277
01:03:07,770 --> 01:03:08,603
I live here with the names pumps.
They're both with these two couples as 

1278
01:03:11,941 --> 01:03:13,620
with heterosexual couples.
And by the way,

1279
01:03:13,621 --> 01:03:14,820
for the record,
right before we started,

1280
01:03:14,821 --> 01:03:17,030
you asked me if I was married straight 
or gay.

1281
01:03:17,360 --> 01:03:18,193
I didn't sense that you can do.
And then the immediate concern was how 

1282
01:03:21,061 --> 01:03:24,180
did you meet?
I want to hear your romance.

1283
01:03:24,480 --> 01:03:26,900
I'm as interested as if it was a woman,
right?

1284
01:03:27,690 --> 01:03:30,890
Because the fist is my view.
You,

1285
01:03:31,000 --> 01:03:34,980
you and you are decent and compassionate
in the micro,

1286
01:03:35,400 --> 01:03:36,233
but you have to have standards in the 
macro s and they are in this one 

1287
01:03:40,140 --> 01:03:40,973
instance.
I don't know of another one I can think 

1288
01:03:44,281 --> 01:03:44,520
of.

1289
01:03:44,520 --> 01:03:46,890
I can't think of one other and it's 
related if you want to hear it,

1290
01:03:46,891 --> 01:03:48,510
it's unimportant,
but uh,

1291
01:03:48,600 --> 01:03:53,600
this is the biggest conflict that I ever
had and that's why I worked very hard on

1292
01:03:53,761 --> 01:03:56,150
this issue to learn what happened.
Uh,

1293
01:03:56,280 --> 01:03:57,113
what,
why the Bible took the stance that it 

1294
01:03:58,531 --> 01:03:59,700
did.
But,

1295
01:03:59,880 --> 01:04:01,320
uh,
we,

1296
01:04:01,980 --> 01:04:03,420
we,
meaning you and me,

1297
01:04:03,450 --> 01:04:04,283
whether you're straight or gay,
we are going to pay a price for the 

1298
01:04:07,531 --> 01:04:08,364
death of gender.
The war against gender is a war against 

1299
01:04:13,291 --> 01:04:14,700
civilization,
I believe.

1300
01:04:15,360 --> 01:04:16,193
Okay.
So now we're getting the slippery slope 

1301
01:04:17,190 --> 01:04:19,230
portion of it.
So that part I would say,

1302
01:04:19,650 --> 01:04:20,483
do you think it's possible that if you 
give people a chance that you let gay 

1303
01:04:22,561 --> 01:04:23,394
people get married,
that the legitimate things that you're 

1304
01:04:25,261 --> 01:04:26,490
talking about,
all these silly things.

1305
01:04:26,491 --> 01:04:28,650
I see this where they don't want,
they don't want to call them students.

1306
01:04:28,650 --> 01:04:30,270
I saw once where they wanted to call 
them comrades.

1307
01:04:30,271 --> 01:04:31,104
Literally.
I mean,

1308
01:04:31,440 --> 01:04:35,280
so I get that release stuff and all the 
labeling and all this nonsense,

1309
01:04:35,820 --> 01:04:38,530
but that may be if you let gay people 
get married that they.

1310
01:04:38,710 --> 01:04:40,450
They would actually be allied with you 
in it,

1311
01:04:40,540 --> 01:04:41,840
but they're not.
It's LG.

1312
01:04:41,850 --> 01:04:46,850
I said some of bb t yeah.
If it was lgb then they wouldn't be,

1313
01:04:49,770 --> 01:04:53,110
but the.
The see the activists,

1314
01:04:53,750 --> 01:04:57,000
you're separating the activists from 
this.

1315
01:04:57,030 --> 01:04:57,863
They're the dominant voice and they're 
the ones who have the boycotts and 

1316
01:05:00,601 --> 01:05:01,434
they're the ones who get gaze angry or 
black sangre or Jews angry or women 

1317
01:05:05,521 --> 01:05:08,010
angry.
They're the anger creators,

1318
01:05:08,011 --> 01:05:11,220
the activists.
You and I would have no way.

1319
01:05:11,221 --> 01:05:13,840
We'd have a great life.
It's been a nonissue but.

1320
01:05:13,870 --> 01:05:18,870
But the activists or the anger creators 
and they added the t and I asked,

1321
01:05:20,261 --> 01:05:22,000
well,
before this whole thing,

1322
01:05:22,180 --> 01:05:25,230
what does t have to do with LG and be.

1323
01:05:25,870 --> 01:05:26,703
I mean,
I had a show on Sirius xm that was on 

1324
01:05:27,821 --> 01:05:30,010
the outcome channel.
The lgbt channel,

1325
01:05:30,130 --> 01:05:30,963
which I'm happy to say no longer exists 
because gay people could have regular 

1326
01:05:33,761 --> 01:05:34,594
radio shows,
so I'm glad that progress came so that 

1327
01:05:37,690 --> 01:05:41,340
there was no need for ghettoisation of a
radio channel just for gay people.

1328
01:05:41,680 --> 01:05:42,513
Uh,
I always wanted to be on the political 

1329
01:05:43,151 --> 01:05:44,690
channel anyway and they threw me on the 
gauge channel,

1330
01:05:44,691 --> 01:05:46,730
so I'm fine with how it all worked out.
Yes.

1331
01:05:46,830 --> 01:05:47,663
Uh,
but I do remember while I assume you 

1332
01:05:48,971 --> 01:05:51,770
rather be on our political channel than 
a gate channel,

1333
01:05:52,120 --> 01:05:55,630
you're not defined by your gayness.
This is getting as I can.

1334
01:05:56,200 --> 01:05:57,033
I'm not even doing that good at it.
Wouldn't you rather be with someone a 

1335
01:05:58,901 --> 01:06:02,800
little more fabulous than this if you 
were to sit across from a gay guy for an

1336
01:06:02,800 --> 01:06:03,250
hour?
And I'm like,

1337
01:06:03,250 --> 01:06:03,520
no,
no,

1338
01:06:03,520 --> 01:06:05,080
you want to be,
want to be normal,

1339
01:06:05,620 --> 01:06:06,550
whatever that is.
I mean,

1340
01:06:06,560 --> 01:06:09,130
I don't even like the word normal,
but normal

1341
01:06:09,400 --> 01:06:12,850
oil is not defined by your sexual 
orientation.

1342
01:06:12,851 --> 01:06:14,020
Yeah,
that's what normal.

1343
01:06:14,021 --> 01:06:14,854
I don't.
I'm not saying heterosexual is more 

1344
01:06:16,391 --> 01:06:19,780
normal by the way.
I actually believe bisexual is the norm.

1345
01:06:20,500 --> 01:06:21,333
So it's a very complex issue because in 
every society prior to the Bible had 

1346
01:06:27,510 --> 01:06:32,080
homosexuality was accepted.
So this is unknown,

1347
01:06:32,290 --> 01:06:33,123
this is truly an.
I didn't come up with this pro gay 

1348
01:06:35,471 --> 01:06:38,250
professors did all the research for me.
Uh,

1349
01:06:38,510 --> 01:06:41,260
so I know all about this.
I devoted.

1350
01:06:41,320 --> 01:06:45,700
I devote a 17,000
word essay on this 30 years,

1351
01:06:45,701 --> 01:06:48,760
25 years ago.
This was a revelation to me.

1352
01:06:48,970 --> 01:06:49,803
I thought the Bible was merely 
reinforcing the anti gay feelings that 

1353
01:06:55,361 --> 01:06:59,680
permeated surrounding society.
But it was unique.

1354
01:07:00,760 --> 01:07:02,920
The Bible said,
men,

1355
01:07:03,520 --> 01:07:06,460
you pr,
you are as happy with boys.

1356
01:07:06,550 --> 01:07:08,770
I don't mean eight year olds,
15 year olds,

1357
01:07:09,100 --> 01:07:09,933
just as a grown man is happy with a 15 
year old girl if that says homosexuals 

1358
01:07:14,891 --> 01:07:17,260
and heterosexuals are identical,
uh,

1359
01:07:17,320 --> 01:07:19,060
but the,
uh,

1360
01:07:19,720 --> 01:07:23,480
but we are telling you we the Bible as 
it were,

1361
01:07:24,470 --> 01:07:26,290
I'm telling you,
the Bible is telling,

1362
01:07:26,291 --> 01:07:31,291
you know,
confine your sexuality to your wife,

1363
01:07:32,350 --> 01:07:34,960
the Bible eroticized marriage.

1364
01:07:36,110 --> 01:07:38,090
So the line though that everyone goes 
to,

1365
01:07:38,091 --> 01:07:39,590
if you're talking about gay marriage,
they always say,

1366
01:07:39,591 --> 01:07:41,240
well,
I'm going to butcher it slightly,

1367
01:07:41,241 --> 01:07:43,680
but don't lie with a man as you would a 
woman.

1368
01:07:43,710 --> 01:07:45,800
Correct.
I don't lie with a woman that way.

1369
01:07:45,830 --> 01:07:47,420
So I haven't.
I gotten a little trick here,

1370
01:07:47,450 --> 01:07:49,730
isn't that?
Didn't I do a little talmudic trick?

1371
01:07:49,790 --> 01:07:51,680
That is its own music trick.
Pretty good.

1372
01:07:51,770 --> 01:07:54,800
Rough.
What do you got for that one?

1373
01:07:54,830 --> 01:07:55,663
Right?
Well,

1374
01:07:55,710 --> 01:07:57,930
don't lie with the women that way.
So it's not a problem.

1375
01:07:58,500 --> 01:07:59,570
I know the Hebrew,

1376
01:08:00,120 --> 01:08:02,670
not exactly that is the way it's often 
translated,

1377
01:08:02,700 --> 01:08:03,533
but the Hebrew that I can get you and 
they're going to come on a do not lie 

1378
01:08:08,340 --> 01:08:09,173
with a male and then the key words,
and they're very rarely translated 

1379
01:08:12,811 --> 01:08:13,644
accurately or Michigan v Dot Shaw.
The lighting's not as you would lie the 

1380
01:08:19,131 --> 01:08:21,350
lines and it's plural,
which is interesting.

1381
01:08:21,870 --> 01:08:25,580
The lines of a woman do not lie with a 
male,

1382
01:08:25,581 --> 01:08:28,670
the lines of a woman.
So it's not what you,

1383
01:08:28,730 --> 01:08:33,050
the gay person would do with a woman.
That's what men do with women.

1384
01:08:33,710 --> 01:08:35,820
But I almost had you there.
You almost did,

1385
01:08:36,010 --> 01:08:37,400
but then you would have.
If I didn't know that,

1386
01:08:38,250 --> 01:08:40,630
I would've thought to Shay that I would 
add you.

1387
01:08:40,640 --> 01:08:41,160
All right,
so let's,

1388
01:08:41,160 --> 01:08:42,510
let's move on to another.
I think.

1389
01:08:42,590 --> 01:08:43,423
I think we got to where that says 
couldn't agree more and that's also why 

1390
01:08:47,031 --> 01:08:48,760
I wanted to discuss that with you 
because I sent them.

1391
01:08:48,760 --> 01:08:51,130
We weren't going to fully agree on it.
Right.

1392
01:08:51,131 --> 01:08:53,020
But I'm so afraid of that,
but yes.

1393
01:08:53,030 --> 01:08:53,863
Well,
people don't hear what might be your 

1394
01:08:56,331 --> 01:08:57,320
issue.
Look,

1395
01:08:57,321 --> 01:08:59,390
there are people on the right who 
they're.

1396
01:08:59,430 --> 01:09:01,730
I hate to say this,
this bothers me.

1397
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:06,830
There are people on the right who have 
contempt for gays and and it's wrong.

1398
01:09:06,860 --> 01:09:09,710
It's biblically wrong.
It's humanly wrong,

1399
01:09:09,711 --> 01:09:11,100
and it does bother me.
Yeah.

1400
01:09:11,410 --> 01:09:12,243
So in a weird way though,
so trump on this must of give you a 

1401
01:09:14,691 --> 01:09:16,950
little anxious because it's pretty 
obvious.

1402
01:09:17,040 --> 01:09:20,170
I couldn't care less.
He could not give me any,

1403
01:09:20,480 --> 01:09:24,370
but it's not.
It's the supreme court has ruled it's,

1404
01:09:24,371 --> 01:09:26,240
it's a nonissue,
but it must be.

1405
01:09:26,241 --> 01:09:29,850
You asked in terms of that slippery 
slope because it does give me an x,

1406
01:09:29,870 --> 01:09:32,930
but I'm not sure other than tweeting and
and by the way,

1407
01:09:32,931 --> 01:09:34,550
maybe one day he will tweet it.

1408
01:09:34,880 --> 01:09:35,713
I wish he would tweet.
Guess Swat teachers can call kids in a 

1409
01:09:39,801 --> 01:09:42,470
lot of our schools,
boys and girls anymore.

1410
01:09:42,920 --> 01:09:46,070
What do you think about America?
I would like him to tweet that.

1411
01:09:46,190 --> 01:09:46,951
Yeah,
so that.

1412
01:09:46,951 --> 01:09:47,784
That's actually a good segue to A.
I'll put the other one aside for a 

1413
01:09:49,521 --> 01:09:50,354
second,
but some of the political correctness 

1414
01:09:50,961 --> 01:09:52,690
stuff,
because this is directly affect.

1415
01:09:52,720 --> 01:09:53,553
I mean it's been a sort of through line 
of everything we've been talking about 

1416
01:09:54,891 --> 01:09:55,724
here,
but it also directly affected your 

1417
01:09:56,871 --> 01:09:59,450
channels.
So the prager u channel you guys,

1418
01:09:59,510 --> 01:10:02,300
and again you're doing videos to explain
things.

1419
01:10:02,301 --> 01:10:04,160
I've watched many,
many of your videos.

1420
01:10:04,420 --> 01:10:06,230
I'm in one next month.
I mean,

1421
01:10:06,470 --> 01:10:07,303
so I've never seen any hatred.
People could argue with some of the 

1422
01:10:10,041 --> 01:10:10,874
facts if they want or they could argue 
if maybe you're coming from a certain 

1423
01:10:13,461 --> 01:10:14,294
political persuasion or any of that,
but I've never seen anything remotely 

1424
01:10:16,221 --> 01:10:17,054
close to hate speech or hate trade or 
any of the stuff that would get you 

1425
01:10:19,041 --> 01:10:20,030
banned or whatever.

1426
01:10:20,240 --> 01:10:22,760
You guys were,
weren't banned from twitter,

1427
01:10:22,761 --> 01:10:24,740
but you were restricted,
restricted.

1428
01:10:25,500 --> 01:10:28,390
Show it in schools or libraries.
I mean,

1429
01:10:29,600 --> 01:10:30,433
it's mind blowing.
We have a video on the origins of the 

1430
01:10:34,220 --> 01:10:34,740
Korean War.
Yeah.

1431
01:10:34,740 --> 01:10:37,010
What's,
why is that restricted?

1432
01:10:37,820 --> 01:10:39,710
So what's happening here with.
Look,

1433
01:10:39,740 --> 01:10:40,573
this show is on youtube,
so I don't want to make the Youtube 

1434
01:10:41,931 --> 01:10:44,840
God's to angry day.
They won't be angry,

1435
01:10:45,740 --> 01:10:46,573
but it's a very look that I was sure the
Wall Street Journal had a feature that 

1436
01:10:51,201 --> 01:10:53,360
editorial on behalf for Prager 
University,

1437
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:54,950
uh,
saying,

1438
01:10:54,980 --> 01:10:56,230
what does youtube doing?
What are you,

1439
01:10:56,260 --> 01:10:57,093
what are you nuts?
Because a lot of Wall Street Journal 

1440
01:10:58,671 --> 01:10:59,504
people have break state Bret Stephens 
system on a Kimberley strassel has done 

1441
01:11:04,101 --> 01:11:08,360
one and and others.
And so they know about us.

1442
01:11:09,020 --> 01:11:10,370
What are you,
what are you kidding?

1443
01:11:10,430 --> 01:11:11,263
A youtube video units.
So what do you think is actually 

1444
01:11:14,101 --> 01:11:14,934
happening?
Leftists are meeting at the top of 

1445
01:11:16,981 --> 01:11:17,814
youtube saying no,
I think that there are all left this to 

1446
01:11:20,430 --> 01:11:23,190
troll the,
uh,

1447
01:11:23,870 --> 01:11:25,590
the webs,
the websites,

1448
01:11:25,720 --> 01:11:28,050
especially among those that are 
successful.

1449
01:11:28,440 --> 01:11:32,280
And we're the biggest producer of 
conservative videos in the world.

1450
01:11:32,670 --> 01:11:36,900
I'm $220 million views last year.
That's a serious number for anybody even

1451
01:11:36,901 --> 01:11:41,010
for the left and uh,
and so they know that we exist.

1452
01:11:41,400 --> 01:11:44,910
And so if one bugs them then uh,
you know,

1453
01:11:44,911 --> 01:11:46,030
they just,
you know,

1454
01:11:46,350 --> 01:11:47,161
say,
uh,

1455
01:11:47,161 --> 01:11:47,994
I don't know,
bad material or objectionable or 

1456
01:11:50,761 --> 01:11:53,460
hateful.
And if they get enough of those,

1457
01:11:53,670 --> 01:11:55,350
there's an algorithm that says,
okay,

1458
01:11:55,351 --> 01:11:56,850
we got,
we got reports.

1459
01:11:57,390 --> 01:12:00,210
They don't think they sit there,
they don't monitor them.

1460
01:12:00,630 --> 01:12:01,463
They get,
they get feedback and so leftist who 

1461
01:12:04,680 --> 01:12:06,990
want to shut us down,
send this feedback,

1462
01:12:07,380 --> 01:12:09,420
but it.
But once they're contacted,

1463
01:12:09,421 --> 01:12:12,660
once the Wall Street Journal,
they then had another editorial.

1464
01:12:12,720 --> 01:12:13,553
They'd three editorials on behalf of 
Prager University in the Wall Street 

1465
01:12:16,350 --> 01:12:17,820
Journal.
That's a big newspaper.

1466
01:12:19,100 --> 01:12:22,830
And of course not one liberal newspaper 
has,

1467
01:12:23,030 --> 01:12:23,863
but the,
so they're not liberal there left a 

1468
01:12:25,201 --> 01:12:27,630
liberal paper would come to our defense.

1469
01:12:27,870 --> 01:12:28,703
So that to me is a great example of what
the difference between that freedom is 

1470
01:12:32,281 --> 01:12:35,790
the biggest issue because it's free 
speech now we're talking about for.

1471
01:12:35,791 --> 01:12:36,900
Yes,
that is correct.

1472
01:12:36,901 --> 01:12:38,570
And that's where,
of course they should.

1473
01:12:38,610 --> 01:12:40,110
Right.
And it isn't even,

1474
01:12:40,170 --> 01:12:41,160
you know.
Well,

1475
01:12:41,161 --> 01:12:44,250
let's let the Nazis March in Skokie,
Illinois,

1476
01:12:44,610 --> 01:12:48,300
which precedes your day.
Are you familiar with that?

1477
01:12:48,510 --> 01:12:50,460
Okay.
So there's a big Jewish area,

1478
01:12:50,640 --> 01:12:52,860
including a lot of survivors of the 
Holocaust,

1479
01:12:52,861 --> 01:12:54,650
lived there,
the Nazis in,

1480
01:12:54,651 --> 01:12:57,490
in their grave evil,
you know,

1481
01:12:57,870 --> 01:13:01,710
had a march neonazis matter march there.
And uh,

1482
01:13:01,711 --> 01:13:04,140
the,
the acl you fought on their behalf,

1483
01:13:04,840 --> 01:13:06,690
but now freedom of.
But so,

1484
01:13:06,691 --> 01:13:09,960
but we're not in that category,
these little Haiti or as you point out,

1485
01:13:10,820 --> 01:13:11,653
there was something.
Do you know the most hated video that 

1486
01:13:13,621 --> 01:13:15,030
we've put out?
This is,

1487
01:13:15,150 --> 01:13:15,983
I would never have predicted this.
I'm sure it's going to be a wonderful 

1488
01:13:18,211 --> 01:13:18,720
irony.

1489
01:13:18,720 --> 01:13:19,553
Yes,
it will be our video on advocating that 

1490
01:13:23,731 --> 01:13:28,731
men get married that has the most amount
of hateful comments directed against it.

1491
01:13:30,960 --> 01:13:31,793
Interesting.
So you guys also did a video on the 

1492
01:13:33,211 --> 01:13:35,070
electoral college.
They are with that.

1493
01:13:35,110 --> 01:13:38,340
What I saw was about what?
$40 million caught some fire on that,

1494
01:13:38,341 --> 01:13:39,174
right?
So I see a lot of celebrities now 

1495
01:13:40,770 --> 01:13:45,630
tweeting that it says white supremacist 
way of controlling everybody.

1496
01:13:45,690 --> 01:13:48,330
And so you don't have to repeat the 
whole video.

1497
01:13:48,350 --> 01:13:49,183
We'll put the link down below so people 
can get hold of this country was not 

1498
01:13:52,910 --> 01:13:56,550
found that to be a democracy was founded
to be republic and it was.

1499
01:13:56,750 --> 01:13:59,490
So what does that mean for people that 
don't have democracy?

1500
01:13:59,500 --> 01:14:00,750
Is One man,
one vote,

1501
01:14:00,751 --> 01:14:01,584
that's all,
you know.

1502
01:14:01,700 --> 01:14:05,440
A plurality determines everything.
There were checks on,

1503
01:14:05,520 --> 01:14:06,353
on how it works in this country.
The most non democratic thing we is the 

1504
01:14:11,531 --> 01:14:13,540
US Senate,
uh,

1505
01:14:13,600 --> 01:14:18,190
senator from Wyoming has the same vote 
as a senator from California,

1506
01:14:18,550 --> 01:14:21,220
although California has 50 times more 
people,

1507
01:14:21,310 --> 01:14:23,140
right?
So by the way,

1508
01:14:23,141 --> 01:14:25,960
I do believe if the left gets rid of the
electoral college,

1509
01:14:25,961 --> 01:14:27,370
they will vote to get rid of the Senate.

1510
01:14:27,480 --> 01:14:28,313
Yeah.
And then basically Wyoming and Montana 

1511
01:14:30,481 --> 01:14:32,730
and all these places will have almost no
power.

1512
01:14:32,870 --> 01:14:33,703
Well,
that's the point of this was set up to 

1513
01:14:34,821 --> 01:14:39,821
be the United States of America.
It's not just America,

1514
01:14:40,070 --> 01:14:40,903
it's states states now the left has 
taken the word states' rights and they 

1515
01:14:45,711 --> 01:14:50,711
have made it into a neo Nazi term,
which is what they did with almost every

1516
01:14:51,070 --> 01:14:51,903
tradition.
Nazis,

1517
01:14:52,100 --> 01:14:52,933
states rights.
Right?

1518
01:14:53,450 --> 01:14:54,470
Well,
that's the theory.

1519
01:14:54,471 --> 01:14:55,720
Yeah.
What's the theory there?

1520
01:14:55,870 --> 01:14:58,030
Oh,
I've heard that.

1521
01:14:58,370 --> 01:14:59,203
Oh yeah.
Because then the federal government 

1522
01:15:00,201 --> 01:15:02,750
cannot suppress your racism.
Oh,

1523
01:15:02,751 --> 01:15:03,584
I see.
So you could just use your own racist 

1524
01:15:05,471 --> 01:15:06,470
state,
right?

1525
01:15:06,500 --> 01:15:07,100
Yes.
Right,

1526
01:15:07,100 --> 01:15:07,933
right,
right.

1527
01:15:08,300 --> 01:15:09,530
So,
uh,

1528
01:15:09,650 --> 01:15:11,990
but that's not what America was founded 
to beat.

1529
01:15:12,240 --> 01:15:13,540
And uh,
you,

1530
01:15:13,560 --> 01:15:16,190
you know,
that outside of this is amazing.

1531
01:15:16,191 --> 01:15:17,024
Outside of the four burroughs,
four of the five boroughs of New York 

1532
01:15:21,050 --> 01:15:24,740
City and La and La County,
trump won the country.

1533
01:15:24,920 --> 01:15:26,870
Yeah.
Just outside of that.

1534
01:15:27,050 --> 01:15:27,980
Yeah.
So then,

1535
01:15:27,981 --> 01:15:28,814
so,
so you realize that's all you have to 

1536
01:15:30,471 --> 01:15:34,730
win is New York and La and if there's no
electoral college,

1537
01:15:35,390 --> 01:15:37,820
that's all you'll campaigning.
What Michigan,

1538
01:15:37,821 --> 01:15:38,980
how do you spell it?
Right.

1539
01:15:39,020 --> 01:15:43,430
So you'd really have a less democratic 
in the final analysis.

1540
01:15:43,490 --> 01:15:44,750
Yes.
Yeah.

1541
01:15:44,910 --> 01:15:49,850
And you know that you have to appeal to 
more people with an electoral college.

1542
01:15:49,880 --> 01:15:50,960
That's what they wanted.

1543
01:15:51,180 --> 01:15:52,460
Yeah.
Um,

1544
01:15:52,590 --> 01:15:54,720
the fact that trump got,
what is it now,

1545
01:15:54,840 --> 01:15:56,680
is it 3 million less votes?
5 million left.

1546
01:15:57,570 --> 01:16:00,660
So really you don't.
Do you think that affects his mandate in

1547
01:16:00,661 --> 01:16:02,580
any way or just it is what it is

1548
01:16:02,690 --> 01:16:06,260
and if you,
if it's like,

1549
01:16:06,410 --> 01:16:08,260
you know,
I don't understand it.

1550
01:16:08,290 --> 01:16:09,123
My team,
our team had more home runs than the 

1551
01:16:12,561 --> 01:16:15,320
other team.
Is that right?

1552
01:16:15,560 --> 01:16:16,760
Right.
Crazy.

1553
01:16:16,761 --> 01:16:19,310
There's other ways to score based on 
home runs.

1554
01:16:19,311 --> 01:16:22,550
Yeah.
If it were based on popular vote,

1555
01:16:22,610 --> 01:16:25,370
he would have campaign in New York and 
California.

1556
01:16:27,080 --> 01:16:28,940
But you,
you have to,

1557
01:16:29,000 --> 01:16:31,730
you win or lose on the rules going in.

1558
01:16:31,920 --> 01:16:32,753
Yeah.
Do you sense that because as you said 

1559
01:16:36,121 --> 01:16:38,940
earlier that there's been nothing like 
this before,

1560
01:16:39,210 --> 01:16:42,480
that there's incredible opportunity to 
do good for the country right now.

1561
01:16:42,481 --> 01:16:44,680
I don't know that trump will grasp that 
opportunity.

1562
01:16:44,990 --> 01:16:46,490
You sense that?
Because I,

1563
01:16:46,491 --> 01:16:49,260
I did not.
I did not support trump.

1564
01:16:49,680 --> 01:16:51,360
I didn't really,
I didn't support Hillary.

1565
01:16:51,361 --> 01:16:53,850
I really didn't like either one of them.
I don't even think I said this publicly,

1566
01:16:53,851 --> 01:16:55,700
but I ended up voting for Gary Johnson,
which I wasn't,

1567
01:16:55,920 --> 01:16:56,753
which believe me I was not happy about 
and I think in a weird way he did the 

1568
01:16:59,491 --> 01:17:00,324
most disservice to the country because I
think if there was ever a year for a 

1569
01:17:02,641 --> 01:17:03,474
libertarian to explain some classical 
liberal values and small government and 

1570
01:17:06,811 --> 01:17:07,644
all that stuff,
I think this was the year to get some 

1571
01:17:08,611 --> 01:17:10,040
ideas out there,
eat and he failed

1572
01:17:10,040 --> 01:17:11,390
miserably.
Um,

1573
01:17:11,480 --> 01:17:14,510
but the day after the election,
even though I didn't support trump,

1574
01:17:15,020 --> 01:17:18,820
I suddenly felt like there's some 
movement here at least is the risk.

1575
01:17:18,830 --> 01:17:22,610
You can feel the tectonics shaking.
So how do you,

1576
01:17:22,640 --> 01:17:25,970
how do you take that out?
I hope in fact,

1577
01:17:25,990 --> 01:17:28,040
that that will take place.
I do have.

1578
01:17:28,400 --> 01:17:30,540
I now have hope change.
Yeah.

1579
01:17:30,930 --> 01:17:32,750
That's what I said at the top of the 
show.

1580
01:17:32,751 --> 01:17:34,700
There's actual change now.
Yeah.

1581
01:17:34,730 --> 01:17:35,840
Yes,
that's right.

1582
01:17:36,020 --> 01:17:37,720
Yeah.
Uh,

1583
01:17:38,650 --> 01:17:41,600
he has one quality that I like.
Yeah.

1584
01:17:41,840 --> 01:17:45,020
He doesn't care what the New York Times 
it says about him.

1585
01:17:45,680 --> 01:17:50,540
That's where as I believe all the other 
17 candidates did.

1586
01:17:51,290 --> 01:17:52,790
But what about the free speech stuff 
with him?

1587
01:17:52,791 --> 01:17:53,624
Because it's one thing to be for free 
speech when you're an opposition and 

1588
01:17:56,121 --> 01:17:57,800
it's cool,
but now that he's the president,

1589
01:17:57,950 --> 01:17:59,930
I mean fighting with the reporters and 
stuff like that.

1590
01:17:59,931 --> 01:18:00,770
Do you not see that?

1591
01:18:02,130 --> 01:18:02,963
So I don't like a lot of these people do
and I know the main reporters and 

1592
01:18:05,601 --> 01:18:07,790
suppressing free speech have nothing to 
do with each other.

1593
01:18:07,820 --> 01:18:08,653
Well,
the idea that the president would go 

1594
01:18:09,891 --> 01:18:13,340
after specific reporters or specific 
publications,

1595
01:18:13,550 --> 01:18:14,383
the chilling effect basically that that 
would have over people that might be 

1596
01:18:17,211 --> 01:18:18,950
critical of the president.
You don't see that as.

1597
01:18:18,951 --> 01:18:19,784
No because they don't get.
They don't get their viewers from the 

1598
01:18:22,281 --> 01:18:23,990
president.
On the contrary,

1599
01:18:23,991 --> 01:18:27,650
for people on the left to be attacked by
trump is a badge of honor,

1600
01:18:28,440 --> 01:18:29,273
that's not even a related issue and he 
should go after them by name if they're 

1601
01:18:32,871 --> 01:18:34,130
rolling.
I mean he,

1602
01:18:34,160 --> 01:18:38,000
if he's rolling then he will look bad.
But if CNN reports,

1603
01:18:38,020 --> 01:18:38,853
uh,
what buzzfeed says and it's the only 

1604
01:18:40,910 --> 01:18:45,910
major network to report the buzzfeed 
what I believe is a lie than,

1605
01:18:47,420 --> 01:18:50,000
than CNN,
which I go on regularly.

1606
01:18:50,150 --> 01:18:53,780
So I have nothing against CNN,
but they should pay a price.

1607
01:18:54,040 --> 01:18:55,940
Do you think we need stronger liable 
laws then?

1608
01:18:55,970 --> 01:18:57,860
Because I'm a,
I'm a free speech absolutist.

1609
01:18:57,890 --> 01:19:00,200
You can say whatever you want as far as 
I'm concerned,

1610
01:19:00,410 --> 01:19:04,040
but I'm starting to think that this 
system,

1611
01:19:04,041 --> 01:19:05,930
we're now going back to what we said 
earlier about,

1612
01:19:05,960 --> 01:19:08,000
you know,
people funding different websites,

1613
01:19:08,001 --> 01:19:10,670
like just the system of constant lying.
Well,

1614
01:19:10,700 --> 01:19:11,533
not within the criteria for a,
for libel in America are almost 

1615
01:19:14,961 --> 01:19:16,190
impossible to meet.
Yeah.

1616
01:19:16,580 --> 01:19:19,480
So I,
I've felt well mold before I,

1617
01:19:19,481 --> 01:19:22,070
I knew Donald Trump.
I never watched the apprentice.

1618
01:19:22,071 --> 01:19:23,540
I didn't know really anything about 
them,

1619
01:19:24,350 --> 01:19:26,330
but I,
I felt that this country.

1620
01:19:26,331 --> 01:19:28,490
I think that there are a couple of 
things from England,

1621
01:19:28,491 --> 01:19:29,324
England has stronger libel laws,
they may be too strong a England has a 

1622
01:19:33,830 --> 01:19:35,360
loser,
pays in courts,

1623
01:19:35,390 --> 01:19:38,320
which I think should be,
should be the issue in,

1624
01:19:38,450 --> 01:19:39,283
in civil disputes and so on.
If somebody sues you and they turn out 

1625
01:19:43,911 --> 01:19:44,744
to be wrong,
why should you have had to pay your 

1626
01:19:46,080 --> 01:19:48,890
lawyer bills?
I think you would cut down the number of

1627
01:19:48,891 --> 01:19:51,380
frivolous lawsuits in this country by 50
percent.

1628
01:19:52,030 --> 01:19:54,830
I think there were things we could learn
from other systems.

1629
01:19:55,010 --> 01:19:57,110
I think libel laws might be one of them.
Yeah.

1630
01:19:57,290 --> 01:19:59,000
If I mean,
if I say,

1631
01:19:59,001 --> 01:20:00,200
you know,
uh,

1632
01:20:00,201 --> 01:20:03,140
I saw you abusing children,
uh,

1633
01:20:03,380 --> 01:20:04,250
wha,
why should,

1634
01:20:04,280 --> 01:20:07,230
why should I not be brought to court for
libel?

1635
01:20:07,350 --> 01:20:08,130
Yeah.
It's funny.

1636
01:20:08,130 --> 01:20:08,963
I just didn't last two or three days.
Somebody wrote a on a fairly decent 

1637
01:20:12,091 --> 01:20:16,830
website that I'm a white supremacist and
I was about to publicly attack them.

1638
01:20:16,860 --> 01:20:18,000
I mean,
I'm a white supremacist.

1639
01:20:18,030 --> 01:20:18,863
This is like absurd beyond imagination 
and I thought I can either now attack 

1640
01:20:22,201 --> 01:20:25,530
them and get them to clicks,
which is what they so desperately want.

1641
01:20:26,550 --> 01:20:28,980
In another situation,
if I had a lawyer and a ton of money,

1642
01:20:28,981 --> 01:20:30,220
I guess I could sue him for lab or I 
Oregon,

1643
01:20:30,221 --> 01:20:31,054
just do nothing and let it be and that's
what I did and I'm sure you could white 

1644
01:20:33,151 --> 01:20:33,984
supremacy.
Well maybe that's an interesting 

1645
01:20:34,951 --> 01:20:36,300
quality.
There was a bunch of other things there,

1646
01:20:36,301 --> 01:20:38,050
but it will be close enough.
You know,

1647
01:20:38,160 --> 01:20:40,440
if there was no evidence,
people say to me,

1648
01:20:40,850 --> 01:20:41,970
you'll,
you'll really love this.

1649
01:20:41,971 --> 01:20:44,270
I get this comment a lot where somebody 
will come up with,

1650
01:20:44,700 --> 01:20:45,960
oh Dennis,
I love you.

1651
01:20:45,960 --> 01:20:46,793
I got,
you know,

1652
01:20:46,860 --> 01:20:48,750
my wife is a witness.
I get it a lot.

1653
01:20:48,870 --> 01:20:52,170
It's very sweet and I'm very touched by 
a book.

1654
01:20:52,230 --> 01:20:53,670
Then they will often it.
Oh,

1655
01:20:53,671 --> 01:20:54,504
but everybody tells you that it's 
actually that is not drew type in 

1656
01:20:59,940 --> 01:21:02,610
Google,
Dennis Prager Asshole,

1657
01:21:03,000 --> 01:21:03,833
and you will get tens of thousands of 
just do it through an image search on 

1658
01:21:09,061 --> 01:21:10,440
that and then I think,
oh,

1659
01:21:10,460 --> 01:21:12,600
that would be the what?
I never thought of that.

1660
01:21:12,650 --> 01:21:13,650
Yeah,
that's a whole other.

1661
01:21:14,070 --> 01:21:16,380
I'm sure there's volumes.
I won't suggest that.

1662
01:21:16,381 --> 01:21:17,214
Yeah,
well you know what I had I had a ton 

1663
01:21:17,941 --> 01:21:18,774
more to talk to you about,
but instead of looking at these now and 

1664
01:21:20,431 --> 01:21:21,630
I know some of them off the top of my 
head,

1665
01:21:21,930 --> 01:21:23,250
we'll do this again.
How about that?

1666
01:21:23,520 --> 01:21:24,750
I would love it.
I really would.

1667
01:21:24,800 --> 01:21:25,351
Yeah.
All right,

1668
01:21:25,351 --> 01:21:26,400
well,
terrific.

1669
01:21:26,430 --> 01:21:27,420
I would love that.
Thanks.

1670
01:21:27,421 --> 01:21:28,021
Likewise.
All right,

1671
01:21:28,021 --> 01:21:28,854
well it's been a pleasure talking to 
dentists and you can check out the 

1672
01:21:31,831 --> 01:21:32,664
prager u videos.
We're going to put the link right down 

1673
01:21:34,171 --> 01:21:37,620
below and don't forget to comment and 
like and all that good stuff.

1674
01:21:37,621 --> 01:21:39,800
So the algorithm doesn't kill us and 
follow it down.

1675
01:21:39,810 --> 01:21:42,060
It's on twitter.
It's at Dennis prager.
