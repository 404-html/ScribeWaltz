1
00:00:05,190 --> 00:00:07,830
You're not going to believe this,
but we have to talk about the regressive

2
00:00:07,831 --> 00:00:08,664
left today.
I've actually been trying to get away 

3
00:00:10,291 --> 00:00:11,124
from discussing the regressive left 
lately and instead talk about the ideas 

4
00:00:14,251 --> 00:00:16,230
of classical liberalism,
which I believe in,

5
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:18,690
but current events keep dragging me 
back.

6
00:00:18,930 --> 00:00:19,763
I see on social media that people are 
using the phrase regressive left a bit 

7
00:00:23,131 --> 00:00:26,280
less lately and replacing it with terms 
like big tier.

8
00:00:26,370 --> 00:00:27,203
The control left or the illiberal left,
whatever name you use for this well 

9
00:00:31,871 --> 00:00:35,940
meaning yet painfully misguided set of 
ideas is largely irrelevant.

10
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:37,133
We needed this phrase to identify this 
backwards ideology which puts groups 

11
00:00:41,791 --> 00:00:42,624
before people and sometimes you need a 
label to get people to understand that 

12
00:00:45,861 --> 00:00:48,150
an idea,
the portion of the left,

13
00:00:48,151 --> 00:00:48,984
which is no longer progressive meaning 
for progress but regressive meaning 

14
00:00:53,101 --> 00:00:57,810
going backwards has been identified and 
now we're clearly bringing people to the

15
00:00:57,811 --> 00:00:58,710
side of reason.

16
00:00:59,100 --> 00:00:59,933
All of you who talk about this with 
friends and family who used the 

17
00:01:02,761 --> 00:01:03,594
regressive left Hashtag on twitter and 
share these videos are part of this 

18
00:01:06,931 --> 00:01:08,790
political awakening.
Yes.

19
00:01:08,791 --> 00:01:12,330
It seems like these backwards ideas are 
getting stronger in some circles,

20
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:14,340
but at the same time,
finally,

21
00:01:14,550 --> 00:01:15,383
for the first time in a long time,
those of us who are liberal and open to 

22
00:01:18,121 --> 00:01:20,820
new ideas are coming together and being 
heard.

23
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:22,433
Whether or not you like trump,
his wind was a huge rejection of the 

24
00:01:25,891 --> 00:01:29,340
identity politics of the left.
But don't take my word for that.

25
00:01:29,341 --> 00:01:30,174
Bernie Sanders said it himself.
The only thing which can replace the 

26
00:01:33,481 --> 00:01:38,430
regressive descent of the left is a 
return to true liberalism or liberalism,

27
00:01:38,431 --> 00:01:40,950
which defends free speech and 
expression,

28
00:01:40,980 --> 00:01:41,761
uh,
liberalism.

29
00:01:41,761 --> 00:01:45,600
That is for liberty and rights of the 
individual and most importantly,

30
00:01:45,610 --> 00:01:48,480
a liberalism that is one for human 
liberty.

31
00:01:49,110 --> 00:01:49,943
I now believe that this regressive 
ideology is the biggest threat to 

32
00:01:53,551 --> 00:01:54,384
freedom in western civilization that 
exists today with the rise of trump and 

33
00:01:58,231 --> 00:02:01,260
the constant comparisons they make of 
him to Hitler.

34
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:05,760
The left now has the perfect boogeyman 
to use to excuse anything.

35
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:07,013
If your opponent is a vile racist,
then you can use violence in any means 

36
00:02:10,591 --> 00:02:14,880
necessary to stop him.
The regressive left has already begun.

37
00:02:14,881 --> 00:02:18,360
Using violence is a tactic and I fear 
that that's just getting started.

38
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:21,840
If you're only now getting up to speed 
on what the regressive left is,

39
00:02:21,841 --> 00:02:25,350
allow me to recap quickly the regressive
control,

40
00:02:25,351 --> 00:02:27,180
the liberal left,
whatever you want to call it,

41
00:02:27,210 --> 00:02:28,043
is a group of people who place identity 
usually based on immutable 

42
00:02:31,861 --> 00:02:36,300
characteristics in a pecking order of 
social importance such as race,

43
00:02:36,301 --> 00:02:38,700
gender,
and religion were victim.

44
00:02:38,701 --> 00:02:41,100
Hood is the highest virtue to be had.

45
00:02:41,550 --> 00:02:42,383
This oppression.
Olympics allows groups to compete for 

46
00:02:44,761 --> 00:02:48,330
who is the most oppressed,
thus the most virtuous.

47
00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:51,060
And if someone isn't as oppressed as 
you,

48
00:02:51,061 --> 00:02:54,120
then you have full authority to oppress 
them accordingly.

49
00:02:54,420 --> 00:02:57,300
So black lives matter can protesting 
gain rights.

50
00:02:57,301 --> 00:02:58,134
March in Toronto,
white men can be banned from leading 

51
00:03:00,851 --> 00:03:01,684
lgbt organizations on college campuses,
prolife women that can be kicked out of 

52
00:03:06,401 --> 00:03:11,401
women's rights marches and so on.
This backwards ideology which demands we

53
00:03:12,221 --> 00:03:15,070
judge each other,
not on the content of our character,

54
00:03:15,310 --> 00:03:19,990
but on the color of our skin or some 
other baked in trait puts the collective

55
00:03:19,991 --> 00:03:20,824
ahead of the individual.
It loves all of its minority groups to 

56
00:03:24,161 --> 00:03:27,100
behave as monoliths.
So if you're a true individual,

57
00:03:27,101 --> 00:03:27,934
meaning you don't subscribe to the ideas
that the group think has attributed to 

58
00:03:31,691 --> 00:03:34,450
you based on those immutable 
characteristics,

59
00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:35,583
you must be cast out.
Many of the guests on my show have 

60
00:03:38,741 --> 00:03:40,780
suffered from this backwards backlash.

61
00:03:40,810 --> 00:03:42,960
I on Hirsi,
Ali [inaudible],

62
00:03:42,980 --> 00:03:43,813
Sarah Haider and Ali Rizvi,
all the felt abandoned by the left 

63
00:03:47,441 --> 00:03:50,530
because they speak out about the 
problems within Islam.

64
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:52,113
They dare to fight for a more tolerant,
more truly progressive Islam in tune 

65
00:03:56,741 --> 00:03:57,574
with the modern society and basic 
liberal values and for that they're 

66
00:04:00,791 --> 00:04:01,624
labeled bigots or worse,
the southern poverty law center even 

67
00:04:04,931 --> 00:04:08,350
labeled Majid as an anti Muslim 
extremists.

68
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:09,513
In reality,
madge is a former Islamist who has 

69
00:04:11,201 --> 00:04:12,034
devoted his life to try to reform Islam 
from the inside to try to reconcile his 

70
00:04:16,631 --> 00:04:17,464
faith with the modern world fighting for
gays and atheists and women and any 

71
00:04:21,881 --> 00:04:24,820
other free thinkers living under 
theocratic rule.

72
00:04:25,090 --> 00:04:25,923
For this,
he is called a porch monkey and other 

73
00:04:27,311 --> 00:04:28,144
vile names by supposed progressive's 
while at the same time he's admired by 

74
00:04:32,171 --> 00:04:33,004
many on the right for being outspoken.
This is the absolute height of 

75
00:04:36,821 --> 00:04:38,950
absurdity,
but it all makes sense.

76
00:04:38,950 --> 00:04:43,950
When you value groups over individuals,
the individual must be sacrificed at the

77
00:04:44,321 --> 00:04:45,154
altar of the collective,
so when any of these people dare speak 

78
00:04:48,371 --> 00:04:49,204
out and call for true tolerance,
they find their tolerance met with 

79
00:04:52,741 --> 00:04:55,000
intolerance,
the left gloves,

80
00:04:55,001 --> 00:04:58,330
diversity and skin color.
Just not diversity in thought.

81
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:02,200
Of course,
this regressive ideology isn't just tied

82
00:05:02,201 --> 00:05:05,080
to Islam at all.
My guest this week is Larry Elder,

83
00:05:05,081 --> 00:05:09,730
a black conservative who has had every 
label and smear thrown at him.

84
00:05:10,270 --> 00:05:11,103
Again,
like with the previous guests I just 

85
00:05:12,611 --> 00:05:15,490
mentioned,
these slurs come from people on the left

86
00:05:15,700 --> 00:05:16,533
who would rather silence and dismiss 
their opponents then actually engage 

87
00:05:19,541 --> 00:05:23,020
them in an honest way.
People often ask me which interview I've

88
00:05:23,021 --> 00:05:23,854
done.
That's changed my views the most and I 

89
00:05:25,481 --> 00:05:28,750
almost always say that it was the first 
time I sat down with Larry Elder.

90
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:29,913
He challenged my views on systemic 
racism as well as the need for a strong 

91
00:05:33,431 --> 00:05:34,264
family and was one of the people that 
helped sell me on why small government 

92
00:05:37,841 --> 00:05:38,674
is important.

93
00:05:38,830 --> 00:05:41,740
If you haven't seen the video,
we'll post the link right down below.

94
00:05:42,220 --> 00:05:43,053
Larry challenged me and I wasn't ready 
so I can't say that it was my best 

95
00:05:46,001 --> 00:05:46,834
moment on camera,
but I listened and learned and just as 

96
00:05:49,481 --> 00:05:50,314
importantly we didn't edit any of it out
so I'm looking forward to picking up 

97
00:05:53,771 --> 00:05:56,800
where Larry and I left off and as for 
where we left off,

98
00:05:56,830 --> 00:05:57,663
this is where I feel there might be 
nothing left for me on the modern 

99
00:06:00,531 --> 00:06:01,364
American left.
You all know most of my positions on 

100
00:06:03,561 --> 00:06:05,540
important issues.
I'm for free speech,

101
00:06:05,541 --> 00:06:06,374
even for White Supremacist,
Richard Spencer to speak and not get 

102
00:06:09,021 --> 00:06:09,854
punched in the face has happened just a 
couple of days ago and I'm still a card 

103
00:06:12,831 --> 00:06:14,120
carrying liberal.
By the way,

104
00:06:14,121 --> 00:06:15,950
I'm for gay marriage.
I'm pro choice,

105
00:06:15,951 --> 00:06:16,784
I'm pro legalization of marijuana.
I'm against the death penalty and the 

106
00:06:18,921 --> 00:06:21,320
list goes on.
At the same time though,

107
00:06:21,321 --> 00:06:23,240
I'm against this oppression Olympics.

108
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:25,490
I'm against safe spaces and trigger 
warnings.

109
00:06:25,700 --> 00:06:26,533
I'm against labeling all my opponents,
bigots and racists and I'm against d 

110
00:06:29,361 --> 00:06:30,194
platforming speakers,
especially at colleges where ideas are 

111
00:06:32,961 --> 00:06:33,794
meant to be challenged and debated.
I'm also for states' rights for 

112
00:06:36,501 --> 00:06:37,334
following the constitution and most 
importantly for having a limited 

113
00:06:39,861 --> 00:06:40,694
government that gets out of the way so 
that you can live your life to the 

114
00:06:43,221 --> 00:06:44,054
fullest.
I've said a few times on the show that 

115
00:06:45,951 --> 00:06:49,880
defending my liberal principles has 
become a conservative position.

116
00:06:50,210 --> 00:06:51,043
Interestingly,
I've also heard conservatives like 

117
00:06:52,491 --> 00:06:53,324
Andrew Klavan and Dennis prager say that
they are conservatives because they 

118
00:06:56,511 --> 00:06:57,344
really are liberals.
This is where we might get lost in the 

119
00:06:59,331 --> 00:07:02,750
definition of liberal in the modern 
sense for his classical liberals.

120
00:07:02,751 --> 00:07:03,584
So if you're still confused about that,
check out a video I did a couple of 

121
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:09,620
weeks ago called why I'm a liberal.
We'll put a link to it right down below.

122
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:10,753
The point is that if the issues I care 
about most free speech rights of the 

123
00:07:14,631 --> 00:07:15,464
individual and limited government 
designed to maximize liberty now have 

124
00:07:18,861 --> 00:07:21,620
almost nothing to do with the modern 
left.

125
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:24,080
My position is basically haven't 
changed,

126
00:07:24,081 --> 00:07:26,990
but I've watched as my team has gone off
the deep end.

127
00:07:27,770 --> 00:07:28,603
The Battle of ideas always gets to a 
tipping point and I sense that we're 

128
00:07:31,491 --> 00:07:35,660
closing in on one right now.
If we can't reign in this madness on the

129
00:07:35,661 --> 00:07:36,494
left than Donald Trump will be all too 
happy to show them his authoritarian 

130
00:07:40,101 --> 00:07:40,934
side.
Both sides are ramping up for a 

131
00:07:42,291 --> 00:07:44,690
showdown.
That seems incredibly obvious to me.

132
00:07:45,230 --> 00:07:49,100
So while I absolutely believe that the 
new center filled with liberals,

133
00:07:49,101 --> 00:07:49,934
conservatives,
and Libertarians and others is rapidly 

134
00:07:52,251 --> 00:07:53,084
growing,
maybe I've lost the left and maybe 

135
00:07:54,951 --> 00:07:57,440
that's okay.
But to end this direct message,

136
00:07:57,441 --> 00:08:00,080
I now kick this back to you guys.
If you're liberal,

137
00:08:00,081 --> 00:08:03,950
is there anything left for you on the 
left or are you left out?

138
00:08:04,670 --> 00:08:08,390
Is it now the conservative position to 
truly be liberal?

139
00:08:08,780 --> 00:08:09,613
Let me know in the comments right down 
below and we'll see if there's anything 

140
00:08:11,781 --> 00:08:13,070
left to discuss.

141
00:08:18,370 --> 00:08:22,390
Joining me this week is an author,
a television pundit host of a nationally

142
00:08:22,391 --> 00:08:23,224
syndicated radio show,
and now most importantly a returning 

143
00:08:26,111 --> 00:08:27,790
guests in that very chair,
Larry elder.

144
00:08:27,791 --> 00:08:29,790
Welcome back to the Ruben report.
Dave,

145
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:30,970
thank you for having me.
I appreciate it.

146
00:08:31,150 --> 00:08:31,983
Well,
I am looking forward to this because I 

147
00:08:33,941 --> 00:08:34,774
mentioned at the top of the show that I 
don't know that any guests that I've 

148
00:08:36,641 --> 00:08:37,474
ever had on challenged me directly as 
much as you did and actually managed to 

149
00:08:41,171 --> 00:08:43,690
change some of my feelings.
That's gotta feel pretty good for you.

150
00:08:44,230 --> 00:08:45,063
Well,
I had a lot of good feedback from the 

151
00:08:46,391 --> 00:08:50,260
interview and people compliment me,
but I said the economist would go to you

152
00:08:50,261 --> 00:08:53,590
because you were asking questions and 
unlike a lot of interviewers,

153
00:08:53,591 --> 00:08:55,710
you really cared about the answer.
Listen,

154
00:08:55,711 --> 00:08:56,544
then you responded.

155
00:08:56,760 --> 00:08:58,470
And so I think if we made the interview 
so great.

156
00:08:59,130 --> 00:08:59,963
So for you to sit down with a liberal,
and I think last time we literally 

157
00:09:04,531 --> 00:09:05,364
didn't know each other.
I think maybe we had met for 10 seconds 

158
00:09:07,051 --> 00:09:07,884
before he sat in the chair.
You sit down with the liberal and I 

159
00:09:09,811 --> 00:09:10,644
think that you were ready to go.
So when I said something about systemic 

160
00:09:13,711 --> 00:09:14,544
reasons,
like you were ready to pounce and you 

161
00:09:15,781 --> 00:09:16,860
did.
And I,

162
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:19,780
and my guy said to me after we had only 
been doing the show for a few months,

163
00:09:19,781 --> 00:09:21,030
do you know,
do you want to edit that part out?

164
00:09:21,031 --> 00:09:21,864
Because there's a part where you really 
kind of catch me in like a a moment 

165
00:09:24,361 --> 00:09:26,010
where I don't know and we'll link to it 
right down below.

166
00:09:26,011 --> 00:09:27,840
I want people to see this.
I think it's important.

167
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:29,033
Um,
how hard is it for you to sit down with 

168
00:09:30,541 --> 00:09:34,470
liberals generally speaking and,
and have an honest conversation?

169
00:09:34,750 --> 00:09:35,583
Depends on the liberal.
If it's an open minded liberal who 

170
00:09:37,171 --> 00:09:38,740
really cares about what you have to say 
it,

171
00:09:38,741 --> 00:09:40,210
it's pretty easy.
Uh,

172
00:09:40,211 --> 00:09:41,850
if it isn't,
if it's somebody who,

173
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:44,850
who's already decided what they've 
decided and believe that liberals,

174
00:09:45,060 --> 00:09:47,640
the Conservatives are mean people,
rotten people,

175
00:09:47,641 --> 00:09:50,010
cold people,
anti science people,

176
00:09:50,130 --> 00:09:52,470
they were going to be in for a bumpy 
night.

177
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:53,281
Right.
Okay.

178
00:09:53,281 --> 00:09:54,270
So let's,
uh,

179
00:09:54,330 --> 00:09:55,163
I want to just recap a couple of the 
things we talked about last time for 

180
00:09:57,181 --> 00:09:59,160
people that haven't seen it and then 
we'll get to all the new stuff.

181
00:09:59,490 --> 00:10:00,323
So real quick,
just tell me a little bit about your 

182
00:10:01,291 --> 00:10:02,124
political evolution.
How do you end up here as a 

183
00:10:04,921 --> 00:10:06,450
conservative?
Well,

184
00:10:06,451 --> 00:10:08,940
it wasn't so much an evolution as it was
kind of like,

185
00:10:09,170 --> 00:10:10,230
uh,
uh,

186
00:10:10,260 --> 00:10:12,690
a series of things that happened to me.
People I've met,

187
00:10:12,691 --> 00:10:15,540
books that I've read,
and that all together you added up.

188
00:10:15,540 --> 00:10:18,900
And I ended up being a conservative.
My father was always a republican.

189
00:10:19,340 --> 00:10:20,130
Uh,
my mom,

190
00:10:20,130 --> 00:10:21,990
uh,
Democrat and so at the kitchen table,

191
00:10:22,060 --> 00:10:22,893
uh,
they would fight all the time about 

192
00:10:23,491 --> 00:10:25,020
politics.
And when I was younger,

193
00:10:25,021 --> 00:10:28,320
I sided with my mom.
I think partially because it was just my

194
00:10:28,321 --> 00:10:30,090
mom.
And when I got older,

195
00:10:30,091 --> 00:10:33,570
I began to side with my father much to 
my mother's a consternation.

196
00:10:33,660 --> 00:10:37,290
So going back that,
let's say 58 years roughly,

197
00:10:37,590 --> 00:10:38,730
uh,
what is,

198
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:39,593
what are the types of things that your 
dad was fighting for as a Republican at 

199
00:10:42,151 --> 00:10:44,730
that time?
I remember vividly during,

200
00:10:44,731 --> 00:10:48,330
during a a Watergate,
my dad was defending Richard Nixon,

201
00:10:48,690 --> 00:10:49,523
which I thought was indefensible.
I thought would Richard Nixon was 

202
00:10:51,781 --> 00:10:55,830
accused of doing with Sabrina suborning 
perjury and getting other people to lie,

203
00:10:56,220 --> 00:10:56,940
uh,
was,

204
00:10:56,940 --> 00:10:59,700
was deeply wrong.
My Dad thought it was trivial.

205
00:10:59,730 --> 00:11:04,230
My Dad felt that Richard Nixon had not 
done anything to enrich himself,

206
00:11:04,590 --> 00:11:06,390
that national security was not 
jeopardize.

207
00:11:06,510 --> 00:11:07,343
Nobody died.
Why would you impeach a president over 

208
00:11:09,661 --> 00:11:13,350
the fact that he was trying to cover up 
a break in to the Watergate?

209
00:11:13,380 --> 00:11:16,200
That was my dad's position.
My mom physician of course,

210
00:11:16,201 --> 00:11:18,420
was that Richard Nixon was a crook and a
liar.

211
00:11:18,690 --> 00:11:19,523
Fast forward,
the polls show that most Americans now 

212
00:11:21,571 --> 00:11:22,404
believe that Richard Nixon should not 
have resigned over what he did and feel 

213
00:11:25,021 --> 00:11:28,500
that what Hillary did was far worse and 
she did not have to resign.

214
00:11:28,650 --> 00:11:30,120
Yeah.
What does that say about you?

215
00:11:30,121 --> 00:11:33,000
Sorta how,
where we've come and where we were,

216
00:11:33,001 --> 00:11:33,834
that we're so obsessed with scandal 
right now and when we know right now 

217
00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:37,133
trump's been in office for,
as we're taping this like five days or 

218
00:11:39,031 --> 00:11:39,864
something and it's like there is just 
going to be massive scandal after 

219
00:11:42,601 --> 00:11:43,434
massive scandal.
Obama said just a couple weeks ago that 

220
00:11:44,911 --> 00:11:47,940
he's very proud that his administration 
got through without a major scandal.

221
00:11:47,940 --> 00:11:49,710
Now,
that depends on where you're definitely,

222
00:11:50,580 --> 00:11:51,413
I suspect you disagree with that,
but in terms of like a personal scandal 

223
00:11:54,101 --> 00:11:56,500
or some real feeling of something or 
that kind of thing,

224
00:11:56,860 --> 00:11:58,510
but,
but maybe you don't see it that way.

225
00:11:58,540 --> 00:12:00,700
I do not see it that way.
But your question was,

226
00:12:00,730 --> 00:12:02,920
what does it say about us?
Where are we gone?

227
00:12:02,980 --> 00:12:03,813
Yeah.
It says about us is that when it's 

228
00:12:04,841 --> 00:12:05,674
Republican in office,
somebody like Richard Nixon that people 

229
00:12:07,091 --> 00:12:07,924
did not like,
there's one level of scrutiny and one 

230
00:12:09,791 --> 00:12:11,100
level of judgment.
And when it's,

231
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:13,210
when it's,
when it's a Democrat,

232
00:12:13,420 --> 00:12:14,253
somebody like Clinton or like Obama,
there's a whole different thing for 

233
00:12:17,351 --> 00:12:20,650
Obama to say with a straight face that 
I've not had a major scandal.

234
00:12:20,830 --> 00:12:22,570
Are you kidding me?
What was fast and furious?

235
00:12:22,690 --> 00:12:23,523
What was Hillary's email server?
What was the denying the nonprofit 

236
00:12:27,131 --> 00:12:28,210
applications of,
uh,

237
00:12:28,390 --> 00:12:31,270
of conservatives with the,
with the irs a what's,

238
00:12:31,300 --> 00:12:33,430
you can have your doctor,
you can keep your doctor.

239
00:12:33,610 --> 00:12:34,443
Um,
and Obama reiterated that line after it 

240
00:12:36,341 --> 00:12:37,174
was obvious from the,
from the rigs that you couldn't 

241
00:12:38,621 --> 00:12:41,680
necessarily keep your doctor or you 
couldn't necessarily keep your plan.

242
00:12:41,681 --> 00:12:42,514
So I buy the line,
didn't he basically say that the ends 

243
00:12:44,741 --> 00:12:46,360
justify the means?
That's sort of what he's saying.

244
00:12:46,361 --> 00:12:47,194
Like I had to sell it and we kind of 
knew I'm not defending that that 

245
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:51,760
particular leg,
but that was sort of his may a cold.

246
00:12:51,790 --> 00:12:52,623
I still think as a scandal for you to 
say that you're going to bend the cost 

247
00:12:55,361 --> 00:12:58,390
curve down,
people are going to be no worse off.

248
00:12:58,610 --> 00:13:01,240
They're going to save money and you 
don't save the money.

249
00:13:01,390 --> 00:13:02,223
Uh,
when you know for well that you can't 

250
00:13:03,371 --> 00:13:05,890
keep your doctor if you want to keep 
your doctor and they say it anyway.

251
00:13:05,980 --> 00:13:06,813
That to me as far as I'm concerned,
is a scandal pulling out all the troops 

252
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:14,170
out of Iraq over the advice of his 
entire national security team.

253
00:13:14,380 --> 00:13:16,480
Hilary wanted him to keep a stay behind 
force.

254
00:13:16,660 --> 00:13:18,650
His Secretary of defense wanted to stay 
behind forest.

255
00:13:18,651 --> 00:13:21,430
The CIA director wanted to stay behind 
for the joint chiefs,

256
00:13:21,431 --> 00:13:23,110
wanted to stay behind,
force our,

257
00:13:23,220 --> 00:13:27,250
our US ambassador to Iraq advised Obama 
against pulling all the troops out.

258
00:13:27,340 --> 00:13:30,280
He did it anyway and the media gave him 
a path for that.

259
00:13:30,550 --> 00:13:32,350
And uh,
Ray Odierno,

260
00:13:32,351 --> 00:13:33,184
the um,
we tiring army general of the joint 

261
00:13:35,321 --> 00:13:37,660
chiefs said that had the troops not been
pulled out,

262
00:13:37,930 --> 00:13:38,763
isis could have been dealt with.
That to me is a massive scandal for 

263
00:13:41,021 --> 00:13:43,660
which Obama got a pass and still gets a 
pass.

264
00:13:43,661 --> 00:13:44,494
So is that one of the situations where 
we're damned if we do and we're damned 

265
00:13:46,990 --> 00:13:50,080
if we don't?
So that had he stayed at most people,

266
00:13:50,081 --> 00:13:50,914
and I'm guessing you included,
probably didn't want us to be there 

267
00:13:52,151 --> 00:13:52,984
forever having left the way he did,
they were having democratic elections 

268
00:13:56,591 --> 00:13:57,370
right before that.

269
00:13:57,370 --> 00:13:59,080
I mean literally in the months before we
left,

270
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:02,350
they were having their first free 
democratic elections and now,

271
00:14:02,410 --> 00:14:05,500
now it's an absolute disaster.
So is that just one of those situations?

272
00:14:05,501 --> 00:14:07,950
There was no win in a way for him at the
end.

273
00:14:07,951 --> 00:14:08,784
Cause either we're going to occupy them 
forever or we're going to pull out and 

274
00:14:11,681 --> 00:14:13,570
then some bad stuff's gonna happen,
which is exactly what happened.

275
00:14:13,571 --> 00:14:13,991
Okay.
Now,

276
00:14:13,991 --> 00:14:16,780
now we're talking about kind of the 
merits of the Iraq war and,

277
00:14:16,781 --> 00:14:18,430
and whether or not we should have stayed
or not stayed.

278
00:14:18,431 --> 00:14:19,264
And,
and that's fine.

279
00:14:19,510 --> 00:14:21,220
Um,
look,

280
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:22,153
I,
I believe that as long as the American 

281
00:14:23,501 --> 00:14:25,540
public does not have the will to stick 
it through,

282
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:27,490
because what George W.
Bush said was,

283
00:14:27,491 --> 00:14:28,324
we'll leave when a rack can stand up.
As long as the American people did not 

284
00:14:31,751 --> 00:14:33,280
have the will to do that,
we shouldn't have gone.

285
00:14:33,670 --> 00:14:35,230
Uh,
but I'm surprised,

286
00:14:35,231 --> 00:14:36,064
I think,
uh,

287
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:37,300
uh,
George W.

288
00:14:37,300 --> 00:14:38,133
Bush and surprising Dick Cheney is 
surprised that over the advice of all 

289
00:14:40,841 --> 00:14:43,540
the people that I just now mentioned,
Obama pulled all the troops out anyway.

290
00:14:43,810 --> 00:14:45,930
He envisioned a stay behind force,
uh,

291
00:14:45,940 --> 00:14:48,130
to make sure that Iraq would be stable.
I mean,

292
00:14:48,310 --> 00:14:49,390
we stayed in,
um,

293
00:14:49,510 --> 00:14:50,410
in,
in Germany,

294
00:14:50,411 --> 00:14:52,790
we stayed in Japan.
We're still in South Korea.

295
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:54,560
Yeah.
It takes a while for doing shirts.

296
00:14:54,680 --> 00:14:55,513
We have 30,000
troops in Germany now or something like 

297
00:14:56,781 --> 00:14:57,614
that.
Nothing like that.

298
00:14:57,630 --> 00:15:00,110
It takes a while for it,
for democracy to take route.

299
00:15:00,470 --> 00:15:01,303
Uh,
and for us to bail out the way we did 

300
00:15:02,001 --> 00:15:02,771
was,
was incredible.

301
00:15:02,771 --> 00:15:03,604
You're responsible and I,
and I thought jeopardize national 

302
00:15:05,121 --> 00:15:06,410
security.
And again,

303
00:15:06,770 --> 00:15:11,330
I am surprised that Obama felt confident
enough to walk into the Oval Office,

304
00:15:11,550 --> 00:15:11,931
uh,
and,

305
00:15:11,931 --> 00:15:13,760
and ignore the advice of all these 
people.

306
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,130
So would your argument be basically that
these,

307
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:18,020
these scandals,
these issues that you brought up,

308
00:15:18,230 --> 00:15:19,063
basically he got a pass because the 
media is sort of in on it with the 

309
00:15:21,801 --> 00:15:23,660
Democrats?
Is that the basic idea?

310
00:15:23,750 --> 00:15:25,610
Absolutely.
For him to say,

311
00:15:25,611 --> 00:15:27,590
as he said many times during press 
conferences,

312
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:30,830
I most proud of the fact that I rescued 
the u s economy.

313
00:15:31,010 --> 00:15:35,300
Really the major things that were done,
tarp and bailing out the auto companies.

314
00:15:35,420 --> 00:15:37,130
George W.
Bush had set that into motion.

315
00:15:37,430 --> 00:15:38,750
Uh,
his stimulus program.

316
00:15:38,751 --> 00:15:40,520
Most economists don't believe it did 
anything.

317
00:15:40,670 --> 00:15:43,490
Obamacare was a brand new entitlement 
dropped on the back of the,

318
00:15:43,690 --> 00:15:45,320
of job creators.
Uh,

319
00:15:45,380 --> 00:15:46,213
and,
and notice how he no longer bragged 

320
00:15:47,391 --> 00:15:50,750
about things like a cash for clunkers 
and cash for clunkers.

321
00:15:50,870 --> 00:15:51,920
He doesn't even,
uh,

322
00:15:51,980 --> 00:15:52,813
cash for clunkers rather,
it didn't talk about that anymore 

323
00:15:54,590 --> 00:15:56,390
because they were boondoggles they did 
not work.

324
00:15:56,391 --> 00:15:57,620
The cost,
the American people,

325
00:15:57,680 --> 00:15:59,900
American taxpayers money.
Okay.

326
00:15:59,930 --> 00:16:00,763
So I know that a certain amount of 
people are gonna hear what you said 

327
00:16:03,141 --> 00:16:05,030
there and go,
that doesn't make any sense.

328
00:16:05,031 --> 00:16:05,864
And then the other hand,
there's going to be a very 50 50 split 

329
00:16:07,281 --> 00:16:09,650
on sort of where,
where people are at before this.

330
00:16:09,980 --> 00:16:11,960
So let's move to some of the 
philosophical stuff,

331
00:16:11,961 --> 00:16:12,794
which I think is okay,
where are we can get into the real meat 

332
00:16:14,571 --> 00:16:15,404
of this,
right?

333
00:16:15,620 --> 00:16:16,453
So racism,
this is the issue that more people 

334
00:16:18,081 --> 00:16:20,750
contacted me about when I was discussing
you than anything else.

335
00:16:20,751 --> 00:16:23,330
And it's where you challenged me the 
most on systemic racism.

336
00:16:24,020 --> 00:16:28,660
So first off,
what does any racism exist in America?

337
00:16:28,670 --> 00:16:30,620
Not Systemic racism.
We'll get to that in a sec,

338
00:16:30,621 --> 00:16:34,070
but what racism is real,
right?

339
00:16:34,071 --> 00:16:36,680
We live in a country has got 330 million
people,

340
00:16:37,310 --> 00:16:40,100
roughly eight to 10% of them believe 
Elvis is still alive.

341
00:16:40,430 --> 00:16:42,470
Almost half of them belief.
If you've seen elvis a letter,

342
00:16:42,471 --> 00:16:44,300
you'll get it.
Obviously there's racism.

343
00:16:44,450 --> 00:16:47,270
There are individuals who don't like 
other people because of their race.

344
00:16:47,420 --> 00:16:50,120
No question about it.
But are there corporations,

345
00:16:50,210 --> 00:16:51,980
they have a policy of not hiring 
anybody?

346
00:16:52,220 --> 00:16:53,940
Uh,
are there governmental agencies?

347
00:16:53,940 --> 00:16:55,520
They have a policy of not hiring 
anybody?

348
00:16:55,850 --> 00:16:57,020
Uh,
the answer is no.

349
00:16:57,021 --> 00:16:57,854
If you can tell me the company,
IBM apple that has a policy of not 

350
00:17:01,131 --> 00:17:01,964
hiring black people tell me or brown 
people tell me who that company is and 

351
00:17:05,721 --> 00:17:06,554
we can deal with it.
I don't know what people mean when they 

352
00:17:07,791 --> 00:17:10,070
talk about institutional racism.
If this were the 50s,

353
00:17:10,071 --> 00:17:11,780
I would know what you're talking about.
Uh,

354
00:17:11,781 --> 00:17:12,614
when there was,
when there was a segregation that was 

355
00:17:13,911 --> 00:17:16,580
legal segregation in the south where you
couldn't marry somebody,

356
00:17:16,970 --> 00:17:19,430
uh,
outside your race in certain states,

357
00:17:19,550 --> 00:17:21,260
but that is no longer the case right 
now.

358
00:17:21,410 --> 00:17:23,390
The racism that people talk about right 
now,

359
00:17:24,140 --> 00:17:24,973
in my opinion,
is individual stuff where some 

360
00:17:26,330 --> 00:17:30,380
individual doesn't like you or some 
individuals don't like you.

361
00:17:30,381 --> 00:17:31,214
But is it something that is anything 
akin to what we experienced in the 

362
00:17:35,060 --> 00:17:36,110
fifties and sixties absolutely not.

363
00:17:36,110 --> 00:17:41,110
And I think it's insulting to people who
have fought hard and died in the 50s and

364
00:17:41,481 --> 00:17:42,314
the 60s to get us to this point to act 
like things are just the same when you 

365
00:17:45,141 --> 00:17:49,220
have people like Eric holder's saying as
he did when he was age,

366
00:17:49,410 --> 00:17:50,243
we now have pernicious racism,
which he said was every bit as bad as 

367
00:17:53,011 --> 00:17:55,710
the old racism.
What the hell are you talking about?

368
00:17:56,010 --> 00:17:57,570
I mean it's,
it's insulting to me.

369
00:17:58,200 --> 00:18:01,170
So what do you do to defeat that idea?
So again,

370
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:02,033
this is you,
you mentioned that in our conversation 

371
00:18:03,481 --> 00:18:04,740
and it really did,
you know,

372
00:18:04,741 --> 00:18:05,740
you got me,
I said,

373
00:18:05,970 --> 00:18:07,470
well,
there's systemic racism.

374
00:18:07,471 --> 00:18:07,981
And you said,
well,

375
00:18:07,981 --> 00:18:11,340
what companies can I just,
I just asked you for an example.

376
00:18:11,570 --> 00:18:14,130
You got me.
And so I do agree with you.

377
00:18:14,131 --> 00:18:14,964
There are racist people.
There are certain amount of people that 

378
00:18:16,471 --> 00:18:19,020
don't like black people that don't like 
you cause they don't like gays,

379
00:18:19,050 --> 00:18:19,883
etc.

380
00:18:20,190 --> 00:18:22,710
We live in a free country.
You allowed to not like people,

381
00:18:22,740 --> 00:18:25,590
maybe odious and an unpleasant,
but you're allowed to.

382
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:27,870
You can't harm them,
but correct.

383
00:18:28,110 --> 00:18:31,560
But what do you do to stop the idea of 
what you're talking about?

384
00:18:31,561 --> 00:18:32,394
That things have changed for the better 
and that there's a certain amount of 

385
00:18:34,921 --> 00:18:38,400
people that want that oppression,
that want the impression because it,

386
00:18:38,460 --> 00:18:41,350
it sort of puts them above other people.
How do you fight that?

387
00:18:41,430 --> 00:18:43,230
You've been trying to fight it,
I think for a long time.

388
00:18:43,290 --> 00:18:44,730
Tell the truth.
That's how you find it.

389
00:18:44,731 --> 00:18:45,790
Tell the truth.
I mean org,

390
00:18:46,170 --> 00:18:47,003
this movement called black lives matter.
I think we talked about that a little 

391
00:18:48,781 --> 00:18:49,830
bit.
Um,

392
00:18:49,860 --> 00:18:50,693
it's,
it says bogus and his phone or your 

393
00:18:52,051 --> 00:18:52,884
movement as the notion that Oj Simpson 
is innocence from having killed two 

394
00:18:56,041 --> 00:18:56,980
people.
Uh,

395
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,490
it's a fraud.
Um,

396
00:18:58,950 --> 00:19:01,770
most cops simply want to do a good job 
and come home.

397
00:19:02,570 --> 00:19:03,403
Most cops frankly,
are more hesitant to pull the trigger 

398
00:19:06,001 --> 00:19:08,190
against a black suspect than a white 
suspect.

399
00:19:08,490 --> 00:19:10,620
There've been a couple of studies that 
have shown that recently.

400
00:19:10,621 --> 00:19:11,960
One of them was uh,
uh,

401
00:19:11,970 --> 00:19:12,803
an economist from Harvard named Roland 
Fryer and he is apparently the youngest 

402
00:19:17,850 --> 00:19:19,620
tenured professor in the history of 
Harvard.

403
00:19:19,970 --> 00:19:20,803
Uh,
and he's a tenured professor in the 

404
00:19:23,010 --> 00:19:23,843
Department of Economics and he did a 
study to find out about police 

405
00:19:25,741 --> 00:19:26,574
brutality.
He assumed he would find the opposite 

406
00:19:29,220 --> 00:19:30,053
and he was shocked.
He said when he found out that most 

407
00:19:31,621 --> 00:19:33,140
police officers,
uh,

408
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:33,780
are,
are,

409
00:19:33,780 --> 00:19:34,613
are more reluctant to use deadly force 
on a black suspect than a non black 

410
00:19:37,351 --> 00:19:38,184
suspect.
And the reason in my opinion is pretty 

411
00:19:39,361 --> 00:19:40,194
obvious.
If you shoot a black person and there's 

412
00:19:41,821 --> 00:19:44,460
any question whatsoever about it,
you're going to be under the gun,

413
00:19:44,461 --> 00:19:46,710
you're going to be po,
possibly prosecute it,

414
00:19:46,980 --> 00:19:48,960
maybe lose your pension,
maybe go to jail.

415
00:19:49,230 --> 00:19:50,063
Um,
coughs are definitely afraid of being 

416
00:19:51,661 --> 00:19:54,150
perceived as engaging in racial 
profiling.

417
00:19:54,151 --> 00:19:54,984
There was a recent poll that just came 
out and it turns out 75% of cops say 

418
00:19:58,131 --> 00:20:01,350
that they are more reluctant now to 
engage with citizens,

419
00:20:01,370 --> 00:20:02,010
uh,
then,

420
00:20:02,010 --> 00:20:04,140
then before,
before the black lives matter movement.

421
00:20:04,141 --> 00:20:06,090
Yeah.
So what's the disconnect then when you,

422
00:20:06,091 --> 00:20:07,680
when you see these,
uh,

423
00:20:07,770 --> 00:20:10,380
cities,
when you see Atlanta and you see Chicago

424
00:20:10,381 --> 00:20:14,280
and you see Ferguson and all of these 
places that are usually under democratic

425
00:20:14,281 --> 00:20:16,500
control,
they usually have democratic mayors.

426
00:20:17,150 --> 00:20:19,170
The group think would tell you,
wait a minute.

427
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:22,950
Democrats are,
are helping black people.

428
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:23,993
So where is the disconnect coming from?
A lot of people are not thinking 

429
00:20:26,281 --> 00:20:27,030
critically,
Dave,

430
00:20:27,030 --> 00:20:28,350
they're just not,
uh,

431
00:20:28,380 --> 00:20:29,550
take,
take Baltimore.

432
00:20:29,551 --> 00:20:33,780
Baltimore was run by a black mayor.
She got 85% of the vote.

433
00:20:33,781 --> 00:20:35,820
What kind of politician gets 85% of the 
vote?

434
00:20:36,150 --> 00:20:36,983
I think Kadafi got 105% and the top two 
officials running the police department 

435
00:20:43,501 --> 00:20:45,210
were black.
The command staff,

436
00:20:45,270 --> 00:20:47,100
majority black.
Um,

437
00:20:47,230 --> 00:20:48,670
all the city council,
Democrat,

438
00:20:48,700 --> 00:20:50,620
majority black,
the state attorney,

439
00:20:50,621 --> 00:20:52,600
the one who brought the charges against 
the six officers,

440
00:20:52,620 --> 00:20:53,830
uh,
is a black female.

441
00:20:54,070 --> 00:20:54,903
And yet,
and still they are still talking about 

442
00:20:56,020 --> 00:20:57,820
systemic racism.
Um,

443
00:20:57,850 --> 00:20:58,683
the fact of the matter is a lot of black
suspects or engaging in bad conduct and 

444
00:21:03,521 --> 00:21:07,210
the police are doing their job and often
the bad conduct is against another black

445
00:21:07,211 --> 00:21:08,050
victim.
Yeah.

446
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:10,330
Does this all come down to education for
you?

447
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:11,433
Because at the end of the day,
if you can teach people properly about 

448
00:21:14,231 --> 00:21:15,064
history and if you can teach them 
properly about what the role of 

449
00:21:17,021 --> 00:21:17,854
government is and all of those things,
that that's really how you untie this 

450
00:21:20,051 --> 00:21:23,050
stuff from just the screeching people on
both sides.

451
00:21:23,830 --> 00:21:25,060
I think so.

452
00:21:25,070 --> 00:21:26,980
And but,
but it's also all about,

453
00:21:27,040 --> 00:21:29,650
uh,
rationally connect connecting the dots.

454
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:34,300
Is it really true that a,
that a young black man is more likely to

455
00:21:34,301 --> 00:21:37,540
be pulled over by a cop than a young 
white man?

456
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:38,800
Uh,
and if it is true,

457
00:21:38,860 --> 00:21:41,040
the other question is why.
Um,

458
00:21:41,410 --> 00:21:42,243
and you cannot have a meaningful 
discussion about any of this without 

459
00:21:44,411 --> 00:21:45,244
talking about behavior.
I think maybe the last time we were 

460
00:21:47,111 --> 00:21:48,850
here,
we talked about a national institutes of

461
00:21:48,851 --> 00:21:50,140
justice study.
Uh,

462
00:21:50,141 --> 00:21:53,020
that's the research arm of the DOJ.
Uh,

463
00:21:53,050 --> 00:21:56,980
they did a study that came out in 2013 
called traffic stops and race,

464
00:21:57,190 --> 00:21:58,023
and it turns out that whether you're 
talking about driving without a license 

465
00:22:01,451 --> 00:22:02,284
or driving while drunk or driving a with
a busted tail pipe or driving without a 

466
00:22:06,071 --> 00:22:08,320
seatbelt or driving without a car seat 
in the back,

467
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:09,473
uh,
it turns out black motorists were more 

468
00:22:10,301 --> 00:22:11,560
likely to commit those crimes.

469
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:12,970
Then a white motorist,
uh,

470
00:22:12,971 --> 00:22:13,804
and the study said that the differences 
in stopping have to do with differences 

471
00:22:16,570 --> 00:22:17,403
in offending.
If you can't have a meaningful 

472
00:22:18,911 --> 00:22:19,744
discussion,
unless you have a meaningful discussion 

473
00:22:20,741 --> 00:22:21,574
about behavior right now,
I suspect that some people on the left 

474
00:22:23,771 --> 00:22:25,060
would hear that and they'd say,
well,

475
00:22:25,390 --> 00:22:27,760
black people have been oppressed 
economically,

476
00:22:27,910 --> 00:22:32,330
so they are more likely to have a tail 
light out or some other thing you,

477
00:22:32,340 --> 00:22:33,173
you would just say that's nonsense.
You would just say that individual 

478
00:22:35,051 --> 00:22:35,884
responsibility,
you've got to drive a car that's 

479
00:22:36,850 --> 00:22:38,710
supposed to be the one that's on.
That's right.

480
00:22:38,711 --> 00:22:39,544
Also,
there's more poor white people in the 

481
00:22:40,481 --> 00:22:41,890
country than there are poor black 
people.

482
00:22:41,891 --> 00:22:42,724
But if black people that complained 
about being disproportionately pulled 

483
00:22:44,321 --> 00:22:45,760
over,
um,

484
00:22:46,420 --> 00:22:49,630
half of all the homicides in this 
country involved black victims,

485
00:22:49,660 --> 00:22:52,810
almost all of the black victims were 
killed by other black people.

486
00:22:53,320 --> 00:22:54,330
Um,
I don't know what Ha,

487
00:22:54,370 --> 00:22:56,770
what that has to do with coffee being 
racist.

488
00:22:56,830 --> 00:22:57,663
It has to do with the fact that it 
disproportionately large percentage of 

489
00:22:59,651 --> 00:23:03,070
crime is committed by a law.
A small percentage of people,

490
00:23:03,250 --> 00:23:05,860
usually males,
usually young black males,

491
00:23:06,010 --> 00:23:06,843
often against their peers.
And that is because of the lack of 

492
00:23:09,371 --> 00:23:11,260
fathers in the home.
I didn't say it,

493
00:23:11,261 --> 00:23:12,094
Obama said it.
A kid raised without a father is five 

494
00:23:13,661 --> 00:23:15,360
times more likely to be poor,
uh,

495
00:23:15,370 --> 00:23:18,490
nine times more likely to drop out of 
school in 20 times more likely to end up

496
00:23:18,491 --> 00:23:19,324
in jail.
The number one problem facing this 

497
00:23:20,471 --> 00:23:22,670
country is not a bad cops.
Uh,

498
00:23:22,750 --> 00:23:26,050
not Obama care.
It is the large number of,

499
00:23:26,140 --> 00:23:29,320
of,
of children raised without fathers.

500
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:32,860
That is a product of the welfare state 
between 1890 and 1920,

501
00:23:32,861 --> 00:23:34,180
1930.
Believe it or not,

502
00:23:34,420 --> 00:23:35,253
a black kid was slightly more likely to 
be born to mothers and fathers married 

503
00:23:38,651 --> 00:23:39,820
to each other than a white kid.

504
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:40,833
So what's the connection there?
What's the 1920 connections to the 

505
00:23:43,001 --> 00:23:46,640
welfare state starts and why does that 
harm the black family?

506
00:23:46,641 --> 00:23:47,840
More?
Uh,

507
00:23:47,870 --> 00:23:49,230
the welfare state,
uh,

508
00:23:49,430 --> 00:23:51,080
really got kicked off in the mid 
sixties.

509
00:23:51,081 --> 00:23:56,081
25% of black kids are born outside of 
wedlock in 1960 right now it's 73%.

510
00:23:56,690 --> 00:23:57,523
And what happened is literally Lyndon 
Johnson launched a so called war on 

511
00:24:00,171 --> 00:24:05,171
poverty and he sent a workers literally 
knocking on people's doors to a prize.

512
00:24:06,261 --> 00:24:09,500
Women of their right to welfare provided
there was no man in the house.

513
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:11,660
And so what we've done is changed the 
culture.

514
00:24:11,990 --> 00:24:12,823
Uh,
we've incentivize women to marry the 

515
00:24:13,731 --> 00:24:14,564
government.
We've allowed men to abandon their 

516
00:24:15,381 --> 00:24:16,214
financial and more responsibility.
It is a neutron bomb dropped on this 

517
00:24:18,801 --> 00:24:20,060
country,
uh,

518
00:24:20,061 --> 00:24:20,894
all because of the war on poverty that 
was done by Lyndon Johnson and the 

519
00:24:23,781 --> 00:24:26,750
Democrats and with,
with the tacit support by Republicans as

520
00:24:26,751 --> 00:24:27,584
well.

521
00:24:28,510 --> 00:24:30,440
One quick thing and we know what we know
that there is a,

522
00:24:30,441 --> 00:24:33,470
that there is a negative incentive 
because in 1996,

523
00:24:33,471 --> 00:24:36,410
when Bill Clinton signed the welfare 
reform act of 1996,

524
00:24:36,650 --> 00:24:41,570
welfare declined by over 50%,
far steeper than anybody predicted.

525
00:24:41,571 --> 00:24:42,404
It turned out there was a bunch of able 
bodied people enable minded people 

526
00:24:44,901 --> 00:24:46,820
sitting on couches and when the,
when the,

527
00:24:46,821 --> 00:24:47,654
uh,
when the Jig was up they got off the 

528
00:24:48,561 --> 00:24:49,970
couch and got it and got to work.
Yeah.

529
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:53,960
Do you think the intentions are good?
So we John and was,

530
00:24:54,040 --> 00:24:54,873
pushes this when the Democrats and the 
Republicans are going to work where 

531
00:24:56,661 --> 00:24:57,494
their intentions were going to help 
people get out of my way or is there 

532
00:24:59,931 --> 00:25:01,800
really something more nefarious going?
No,

533
00:25:01,820 --> 00:25:03,270
the intentions were quite good.
Uh,

534
00:25:03,330 --> 00:25:04,760
uh,
uh,

535
00:25:04,850 --> 00:25:06,800
Fdr talked about,
uh,

536
00:25:06,950 --> 00:25:09,070
uh,
the corrosive effect of,

537
00:25:09,100 --> 00:25:11,990
of government dependency when he 
launched the new deal.

538
00:25:12,350 --> 00:25:13,250
Uh,
and,

539
00:25:13,251 --> 00:25:14,084
uh,
Lyndon Johnson talked about getting 

540
00:25:15,741 --> 00:25:16,574
people off of government dependencies 
and making them more self self 

541
00:25:19,191 --> 00:25:20,810
sufficient by launching the war on 
poverty.

542
00:25:21,020 --> 00:25:23,300
Those were their stated goals and I 
believed them.

543
00:25:23,680 --> 00:25:24,513
Uh,
but human nature is such that if you 

544
00:25:26,301 --> 00:25:29,120
allow somebody in easy out,
some people will take an easy out.

545
00:25:29,300 --> 00:25:30,800
And that's what we've done with a lot of
people.

546
00:25:30,830 --> 00:25:31,663
So basically we've said to a certain 
subset of people and it I guess is a 

547
00:25:34,761 --> 00:25:35,594
disproportionate amount of black people.
We've said you can get a certain amount 

548
00:25:39,141 --> 00:25:39,974
of government handouts and basically 
your argument is that this is now just 

549
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:43,033
leaving people in the status quo.
Because if you can get something 

550
00:25:46,490 --> 00:25:48,530
subsidized housing,
whatever it is,

551
00:25:48,531 --> 00:25:51,590
food stamps and you don't have to do 
anything and you'll just take it,

552
00:25:51,591 --> 00:25:55,290
that's not a black characteristic.
That's a characteristic of what else,

553
00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:56,840
what any human of human nature.

554
00:25:56,840 --> 00:25:58,030
And uh,
there was uh,

555
00:25:58,130 --> 00:26:01,100
uh,
a poll taken in 1986 by the La Times.

556
00:26:01,340 --> 00:26:04,100
They asked poor people in non poor 
people a bunch of questions.

557
00:26:04,410 --> 00:26:05,750
Um,
and one of them was,

558
00:26:05,780 --> 00:26:06,613
do you believe that that poor people 
have additional children to get 

559
00:26:09,831 --> 00:26:13,310
additional money from welfare?
The majority of non poor people said no.

560
00:26:13,311 --> 00:26:15,170
They probably thought that it was 
insulting if not racist.

561
00:26:15,380 --> 00:26:18,140
64% of poor people said yes.
Also,

562
00:26:18,141 --> 00:26:19,520
they were asked this question,
poor people,

563
00:26:19,521 --> 00:26:22,760
where do you believe that welfare is a 
crutch,

564
00:26:23,190 --> 00:26:25,340
a creates dependency or do you believe 
it's a,

565
00:26:25,750 --> 00:26:26,583
a,
a means to get you to stand on your own 

566
00:26:28,491 --> 00:26:29,324
two feet and go forward?
More of them said it was a crutch that 

567
00:26:31,781 --> 00:26:32,614
created dependency than it was a means 
to get you on your own two feet and go 

568
00:26:34,761 --> 00:26:36,590
forward.
These are poor people responding to this

569
00:26:36,591 --> 00:26:37,550
poll.
Yeah.

570
00:26:37,910 --> 00:26:40,340
So basically guilt has a lot to do with 
this.

571
00:26:40,340 --> 00:26:41,173
The guilt sort of white liberal guilt in
a way has actually subjected black 

572
00:26:45,511 --> 00:26:46,740
people to,
uh,

573
00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:47,753
not all black people of course,
but a certain subset of poor black 

574
00:26:49,861 --> 00:26:52,860
people to a set of circumstances that 
they almost can't get out of.

575
00:26:53,220 --> 00:26:54,053
I think that's part of it.
But also I think part of it is people 

576
00:26:56,581 --> 00:26:57,414
that are comfortable and wealthy and 
well educated look around to figure out 

577
00:27:01,291 --> 00:27:03,600
how they can perfect the world.
Uh,

578
00:27:03,601 --> 00:27:08,210
and they forget that part of getting 
anywhere is overcoming obstacles and,

579
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:09,650
and struggling.
Uh,

580
00:27:09,660 --> 00:27:12,300
and if you make things real comfortable 
for people,

581
00:27:12,750 --> 00:27:14,280
some people are going to take the easy 
way out.

582
00:27:14,281 --> 00:27:16,620
So I think it's a kind of mindset,
that kind of mentality.

583
00:27:16,770 --> 00:27:17,603
Yeah.
When did we get to that point where 

584
00:27:18,900 --> 00:27:23,040
fighting for what's yours fighting that 
no one should give you anything,

585
00:27:23,041 --> 00:27:25,680
that the government isn't supposed to 
give you anything and no one should,

586
00:27:25,681 --> 00:27:27,270
that it is your life to live.

587
00:27:27,270 --> 00:27:28,103
It is your,
it's your job as a human to pursue what 

588
00:27:30,271 --> 00:27:31,104
makes you happy and take what you can.
And that doesn't mean destroying 

589
00:27:33,331 --> 00:27:34,430
everything around you.
Right.

590
00:27:34,520 --> 00:27:36,300
But,
but finding what makes you happy.

591
00:27:36,690 --> 00:27:39,390
When did that get crossed up?
Is it all connected to this,

592
00:27:39,391 --> 00:27:40,920
do you think that's,
that's a good question.

593
00:27:40,950 --> 00:27:41,783
Uh,
I think the founding fathers intended 

594
00:27:42,661 --> 00:27:47,661
for us to have what people have 
characterized as rugged individualism.

595
00:27:47,970 --> 00:27:50,040
Article One,
section eight of the constitution,

596
00:27:50,330 --> 00:27:51,163
uh,
set forth a handful of things that the 

597
00:27:52,291 --> 00:27:53,700
federal government should do.
Uh,

598
00:27:53,701 --> 00:27:56,160
they did not include social security.
They did not include Medicare.

599
00:27:56,161 --> 00:27:58,590
They did not include Medicaid.
They did not include charity.

600
00:27:58,830 --> 00:28:00,180
But we've gotten away from that,
I think,

601
00:28:00,181 --> 00:28:02,130
because as people become more and more 
affluent,

602
00:28:02,410 --> 00:28:03,243
um,
they look around and try to perfect the 

603
00:28:04,411 --> 00:28:06,930
world.
Would you roll back all of those things?

604
00:28:06,930 --> 00:28:09,060
I know.
Do you consider yourself a libertarian?

605
00:28:09,630 --> 00:28:11,110
You're basically a libertarian.
Yes.

606
00:28:11,330 --> 00:28:13,740
So,
so you wouldn't lay a libertarian small,

607
00:28:13,741 --> 00:28:14,574
I'm a law and order a libertarian.
So you think there should be driver's 

608
00:28:17,461 --> 00:28:18,350
licenses?
Oh,

609
00:28:18,380 --> 00:28:19,141
of course.
Yeah.

610
00:28:19,141 --> 00:28:20,190
So you're not like,
well,

611
00:28:20,191 --> 00:28:21,024
because that's an important distinction 
to make because there are plenty of 

612
00:28:22,471 --> 00:28:24,330
libertarians that don't.
So you're,

613
00:28:24,360 --> 00:28:26,040
so what makes you not a classical 
liberal then?

614
00:28:26,041 --> 00:28:26,874
Because that's,
this is become one of the themes over 

615
00:28:28,041 --> 00:28:28,874
the last time.
I am a classical liberal and the John 

616
00:28:31,050 --> 00:28:31,990
Stuart mill sense of it.
Yeah,

617
00:28:32,010 --> 00:28:32,843
absolutely.
I am somebody who believes in maximum 

618
00:28:35,131 --> 00:28:35,964
personal freedom,
but also you have to believe in the 

619
00:28:37,710 --> 00:28:38,543
excellent personal responsibility.
And that is to deal with the 

620
00:28:40,261 --> 00:28:42,210
consequences of your choices.
Uh,

621
00:28:42,230 --> 00:28:43,063
and,
and a lot of people don't want to do 

622
00:28:43,831 --> 00:28:44,640
that.
Uh,

623
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:46,680
they want to show people from,
uh,

624
00:28:46,710 --> 00:28:48,150
the,
the vestiges of,

625
00:28:48,151 --> 00:28:48,720
of,
of,

626
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:50,010
of the world of life.

627
00:28:50,310 --> 00:28:51,720
Uh,
and when you do that,

628
00:28:51,950 --> 00:28:56,100
you also will create some other kind of 
reaction that there'll be worse.

629
00:28:56,250 --> 00:28:57,083
My father used to say,
when you're trying to get something for 

630
00:28:58,351 --> 00:28:59,184
nothing,
you often end up getting nothing for 

631
00:29:00,451 --> 00:29:01,530
something.
Yeah.

632
00:29:01,920 --> 00:29:04,860
So what sort of social safety net should
there be then?

633
00:29:04,861 --> 00:29:06,240
Or do you not think that there should 
be?

634
00:29:06,241 --> 00:29:07,074
And this may be the difference between a
small l libertarian and a classical 

635
00:29:09,721 --> 00:29:10,554
liberal?
Uh,

636
00:29:10,680 --> 00:29:12,810
I think most classical liberals would 
feel the way I feel.

637
00:29:12,811 --> 00:29:16,380
And that is that the safety net should 
be provided by other individuals,

638
00:29:16,410 --> 00:29:18,390
not by government,
but by churches,

639
00:29:18,391 --> 00:29:19,224
nonprofits.
One of the things that I'm Alexis de 

640
00:29:22,140 --> 00:29:23,820
Tocqueville wrote about in democracy in 
America,

641
00:29:23,821 --> 00:29:24,654
where were all of these,
what were called mutual aid societies 

642
00:29:27,091 --> 00:29:29,310
that were set up.
This is before social security,

643
00:29:29,311 --> 00:29:30,810
before Medicare,
before Medicaid.

644
00:29:31,230 --> 00:29:32,670
Uh,
and believe it or not,

645
00:29:32,760 --> 00:29:33,593
um,
a black person living in Chicago in 

646
00:29:36,170 --> 00:29:37,440
1920s,
1930s,

647
00:29:37,560 --> 00:29:40,500
was more likely to have health care 
insurance and a white person because,

648
00:29:40,650 --> 00:29:41,483
uh,
he joined these mutual aid societies 

649
00:29:43,510 --> 00:29:44,343
that provided that.

650
00:29:44,560 --> 00:29:46,750
All right.
So let's circle back to the family stuff

651
00:29:46,780 --> 00:29:47,613
because I remember you said the family 
stuff last time and the importance of a 

652
00:29:50,051 --> 00:29:51,550
two parent family.
I was,

653
00:29:51,551 --> 00:29:52,384
I come,
my parents were still married 40 some 

654
00:29:53,591 --> 00:29:56,140
odd years.
I just went back to my childhood home in

655
00:29:56,141 --> 00:29:59,410
New York and for the first time I did 
have,

656
00:29:59,740 --> 00:30:02,230
I think I saw a little more tangibly 
what you were talking about,

657
00:30:02,231 --> 00:30:03,064
to go to my parents' house to feel that 
it was the same place that I grew up in 

658
00:30:06,341 --> 00:30:07,174
that same community that I was part of.
I visited family friends and some 

659
00:30:10,661 --> 00:30:11,494
relatives that were nearby and it did 
feel like it connected me to something 

660
00:30:15,131 --> 00:30:17,590
that was important.
It's sort of an a femoral thing.

661
00:30:17,591 --> 00:30:19,270
It's something that's not quite 
tangible,

662
00:30:19,271 --> 00:30:20,770
but something that's important that 
does.

663
00:30:21,100 --> 00:30:22,870
It lays your roots,
so to speak,

664
00:30:22,871 --> 00:30:25,360
and that you can sort of figure out who 
you are from that.

665
00:30:26,230 --> 00:30:28,060
Is that really what you're talking about
with the family?

666
00:30:28,061 --> 00:30:28,894
That not,
it's not just that there's a 

667
00:30:30,461 --> 00:30:31,990
breadwinner,
but something else,

668
00:30:31,991 --> 00:30:35,680
something that's sort of bigger than 
that that really can lay out what a life

669
00:30:35,681 --> 00:30:37,210
is supposed to be.
Absolutely.

670
00:30:37,211 --> 00:30:40,360
It's not just a additional check as you 
pointed out.

671
00:30:40,540 --> 00:30:43,480
It's also being a role model.
Watching your father get up,

672
00:30:43,481 --> 00:30:45,460
go,
go to work when he doesn't feel like it.

673
00:30:45,461 --> 00:30:47,440
Watching him live up to his 
responsibilities.

674
00:30:47,950 --> 00:30:48,780
And you know,
the,

675
00:30:48,780 --> 00:30:51,280
the three arguably the biggest leaders 
in this country,

676
00:30:51,281 --> 00:30:53,230
black leaders in this country or Jesse 
Jackson,

677
00:30:53,590 --> 00:30:58,490
Al Sharpton and Louis Farrakhan and all 
of them had difficult not for you,

678
00:30:58,540 --> 00:30:59,373
Huh?
All of them had difficult if not 

679
00:31:00,551 --> 00:31:02,440
nonexistent relationship with their own 
fathers.

680
00:31:02,650 --> 00:31:05,650
Jesse Jackson's mother was a teenager,
uh,

681
00:31:05,770 --> 00:31:08,200
who was impregnated by the married man 
who lived next door.

682
00:31:08,560 --> 00:31:10,540
And when Jesse Jackson was raised in 
South Carolina,

683
00:31:10,541 --> 00:31:11,500
kits taunted him.

684
00:31:11,710 --> 00:31:12,543
Jesse ain't got no daddy.
Jesse ain't got no daddy because that's 

685
00:31:14,351 --> 00:31:17,170
how rare it was in those days to be 
raised without a father.

686
00:31:18,010 --> 00:31:18,843
Al Sharpton had a nice middle class life
until his father abandoned the family 

687
00:31:21,520 --> 00:31:24,490
and then down to the ghetto.
And in the case of Farah Khan,

688
00:31:24,491 --> 00:31:27,220
his mom was a strange from her husband,
had a boyfriend,

689
00:31:27,221 --> 00:31:28,870
took back up with the husband,
got pregnant,

690
00:31:28,871 --> 00:31:31,240
didn't want the boyfriend to know and 
tried to abort,

691
00:31:31,290 --> 00:31:33,220
uh,
Louis Farrakhan with a coat hanger.

692
00:31:33,370 --> 00:31:34,203
So all three of these men in my opinion 
have deep psychological issues because 

693
00:31:36,911 --> 00:31:38,680
of the lack of relationship with their 
own fathers.

694
00:31:38,950 --> 00:31:40,690
And that is one of the reasons why,
in my opinion,

695
00:31:40,691 --> 00:31:41,524
they're so angry despite the fact that 
things have gotten so much better in 

696
00:31:43,751 --> 00:31:44,584
terms of race relations in this country.
So basically they can't let go of that 

697
00:31:47,531 --> 00:31:47,861
pain.
I mean,

698
00:31:47,861 --> 00:31:51,220
not to fully cycle analyze them,
but they're dealing with a personal pain

699
00:31:51,221 --> 00:31:54,190
that is extremely painful for sure.

700
00:31:54,430 --> 00:31:55,263
And they can't let go of that pain.
So now they're kind of projecting it on 

701
00:31:58,051 --> 00:32:00,670
to the rest of us via policy,
in my opinion.

702
00:32:00,671 --> 00:32:02,500
Again,
I'm not a psychologist if I were,

703
00:32:02,501 --> 00:32:03,980
that's what I would say.
Um,

704
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:07,330
now a lot of people have had bad 
circumstances and have not been that,

705
00:32:07,331 --> 00:32:08,830
uh,
that sour because of it.

706
00:32:08,831 --> 00:32:10,870
My father.
And then we talked about him before.

707
00:32:10,871 --> 00:32:13,570
My father does not know who his 
biological father is.

708
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:16,120
The man named elder was a man who was in
his life the longest.

709
00:32:16,121 --> 00:32:18,820
He was a alcoholic who abused him and 
abused,

710
00:32:18,821 --> 00:32:19,450
uh,
uh,

711
00:32:19,450 --> 00:32:21,160
his mother physically.
Uh,

712
00:32:21,161 --> 00:32:21,994
and my dad was literally thrown out of 
the house when he was 13 years old by 

713
00:32:24,821 --> 00:32:27,340
his mother's then boyfriend who sided 
with,

714
00:32:27,341 --> 00:32:28,121
uh,
with,

715
00:32:28,121 --> 00:32:28,954
uh,
her boyfriend when he and my dad got 

716
00:32:31,721 --> 00:32:34,420
into a corner when he was 13 years old,
came home from chemo from school,

717
00:32:34,780 --> 00:32:36,340
and he was making too much noise to 
boyfriend.

718
00:32:36,340 --> 00:32:37,900
Got Mad.
My Dad said something to him,

719
00:32:38,220 --> 00:32:39,860
uh,
his mother's side with the boyfriend out

720
00:32:39,861 --> 00:32:40,640
of the house.
He goes,

721
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:41,750
wow.
13 years old,

722
00:32:41,810 --> 00:32:43,130
Jim Crow,
south Athens,

723
00:32:43,131 --> 00:32:43,964
Georgia,
right at the beginning of the Great 

724
00:32:45,350 --> 00:32:46,183
Depression.
My father was never angry though my 

725
00:32:47,751 --> 00:32:49,930
father said to us,
always us,

726
00:32:49,940 --> 00:32:52,220
meaning my two brothers and me,
I picked up the cars.

727
00:32:52,250 --> 00:32:54,170
I dealt with them to the best that I 
could.

728
00:32:54,500 --> 00:32:55,430
Uh,
what did he do?

729
00:32:55,590 --> 00:33:00,590
Did you do a series of whatever anybody 
would pay him to do a cleaning?

730
00:33:01,551 --> 00:33:04,910
This cleaning that ultimately he got a 
job with the pullman porters.

731
00:33:04,911 --> 00:33:08,030
They were the largest private employer 
of blacks in those days,

732
00:33:08,300 --> 00:33:10,520
and he was able to travel,
travel around the country.

733
00:33:10,521 --> 00:33:13,220
That's how we ended up in California.
He came here one time,

734
00:33:13,221 --> 00:33:14,990
it was sunny,
people smiled,

735
00:33:15,080 --> 00:33:18,800
it seemed more friendly.
And after the war was over at my dad,

736
00:33:18,830 --> 00:33:21,020
uh,
I relocated to California to try and get

737
00:33:21,021 --> 00:33:21,860
a job as a cook.

738
00:33:22,100 --> 00:33:24,920
And he was told that he had no 
references,

739
00:33:24,980 --> 00:33:27,500
which was California's way of saying we 
don't hire black people.

740
00:33:27,530 --> 00:33:28,580
Right.
Uh,

741
00:33:28,581 --> 00:33:29,414
and my dad ended up being a janitor,
worked two full time jobs at the 

742
00:33:31,521 --> 00:33:34,100
janitor,
save these nickels and dimes,

743
00:33:34,270 --> 00:33:36,740
started a little cafe near the Pico 
Union area,

744
00:33:36,741 --> 00:33:38,420
which he ran until the 80s.
In fact,

745
00:33:38,421 --> 00:33:40,670
I wrote about this in my last book is 
called Dear Father,

746
00:33:40,671 --> 00:33:41,504
dear son,
two lives eight hours because my father 

747
00:33:43,191 --> 00:33:44,650
and I did not get along.
Uh,

748
00:33:44,800 --> 00:33:48,710
I thought of my father is grouchy and an
honoree and I couldn't understand why he

749
00:33:48,711 --> 00:33:51,950
was so ill tempered until I got 25 years
old.

750
00:33:52,220 --> 00:33:55,580
We stopped talking to each other when I 
was 15 we didn't speak to each other for

751
00:33:55,581 --> 00:33:56,414
10 years.
Wow.

752
00:33:56,990 --> 00:33:57,823
And my dad and I sat down for what I 
thought would be a 10 minute 

753
00:33:59,241 --> 00:34:00,074
conversation.
It ended up being an eight hour 

754
00:34:00,741 --> 00:34:03,320
conversation and that's why I wrote the 
book a dear father,

755
00:34:03,321 --> 00:34:04,370
dear son,
two lives,

756
00:34:04,371 --> 00:34:06,170
eight hours about this conversation.

757
00:34:06,590 --> 00:34:09,470
Do you think that despite what you've 
said about,

758
00:34:09,720 --> 00:34:10,880
uh,
President Obama,

759
00:34:10,881 --> 00:34:13,160
do you think that now that he's out of 
office,

760
00:34:13,161 --> 00:34:16,520
maybe he could step into the role that 
you'd like to see him in?

761
00:34:16,700 --> 00:34:21,650
So instead of America turning to Jesse 
Jackson and Farrakhan and Sharpton,

762
00:34:22,160 --> 00:34:24,530
maybe they can turn it to you,
but if not to Larry elder,

763
00:34:24,830 --> 00:34:25,663
but if not to Larry elder,
that may be Obama when you disconnected 

764
00:34:28,701 --> 00:34:29,534
from politics,
can actually talk about some of those 

765
00:34:31,881 --> 00:34:32,421
things.
Cause I mean,

766
00:34:32,421 --> 00:34:33,254
you addressed it a second ago,
you said he did mention the family and 

767
00:34:35,151 --> 00:34:35,984
mentioned fathers and all that.
So is there a chance that you think 

768
00:34:37,581 --> 00:34:39,770
there's a chance for that?
I'm not optimistic because,

769
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:40,633
uh,
in his last press conference he talked 

770
00:34:41,961 --> 00:34:44,930
about we still have a great deal to do 
on race.

771
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:45,793
By the way,
when people talk about a great deal to 

772
00:34:46,671 --> 00:34:49,820
do on race or all they really mean is 
how black people feel about white people

773
00:34:49,821 --> 00:34:50,654
and vice versa.

774
00:34:50,780 --> 00:34:53,090
They don't care about Hispanic,
they don't care about Asians.

775
00:34:53,091 --> 00:34:55,700
They really care about the relationship 
between blacks and whites.

776
00:34:56,060 --> 00:34:56,893
Um,
and Obama has throughout his eight 

777
00:34:59,121 --> 00:35:00,800
years,
in my opinion,

778
00:35:00,890 --> 00:35:03,800
when he could have ignored the race card
or put it in perspective,

779
00:35:03,801 --> 00:35:04,720
picked it up,
uh,

780
00:35:04,790 --> 00:35:06,620
whether it's Cambridge police or whether
it's,

781
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:07,580
uh,
trayvon Martin.

782
00:35:07,581 --> 00:35:10,460
If I had a Sony would look like Trayvon,
whether it's invoking ferguson,

783
00:35:10,760 --> 00:35:11,593
whether it's hiring somebody like Eric 
Holder lecturing in the country on race 

784
00:35:13,731 --> 00:35:14,810
and racism.
Uh,

785
00:35:14,811 --> 00:35:18,020
Obama I think,
believes that racism remains this huge,

786
00:35:18,021 --> 00:35:21,460
massive problem in America despite his 
election and despite his reelection.

787
00:35:21,610 --> 00:35:22,443
And I don't,
and so I don't think he's going to say 

788
00:35:23,721 --> 00:35:25,580
the right thing and do the right thing.
I think he,

789
00:35:25,670 --> 00:35:26,503
I think he's encouraged black people to 
think of themselves as victims as 

790
00:35:28,671 --> 00:35:30,440
opposed to saying,
look at me.

791
00:35:30,650 --> 00:35:31,760
I busted my bud.

792
00:35:32,630 --> 00:35:35,390
My parents made sure I had a good 
education.

793
00:35:35,710 --> 00:35:37,950
I didn't make bad moral mistakes.
Uh,

794
00:35:37,980 --> 00:35:41,490
I got married before I had kids follow 
my model and you'll be fine.

795
00:35:41,491 --> 00:35:43,560
He has not said that at all.
What he said is,

796
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:44,633
we have real problems in this country.
He embraced the black lives matter 

797
00:35:46,921 --> 00:35:47,750
movement.
Uh,

798
00:35:47,750 --> 00:35:49,950
I mentioned Trayvon Martin.
I mentioned some of the other things.

799
00:35:50,070 --> 00:35:50,903
In my opinion,
the reason that a lot of people voted 

800
00:35:53,521 --> 00:35:54,354
for Obama was because he,
they thought he was going to do exactly 

801
00:35:56,161 --> 00:35:58,470
what you suggested,
which is to heal us,

802
00:35:58,590 --> 00:35:59,423
put things in perspective,
tell young black people they ought not 

803
00:36:01,861 --> 00:36:03,390
be angry when they're pulled over by a 
cop.

804
00:36:03,391 --> 00:36:05,850
All the copies is doing is his job.
Instead,

805
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,340
he did the opposite.
So I'm not optimistic at all.

806
00:36:08,341 --> 00:36:10,080
The he'll play the kind of role that 
you'd suggest.

807
00:36:10,110 --> 00:36:11,850
Yeah.
So the way we've demon hope I'm wrong.

808
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:14,430
I hope you're on too.
I don't know.

809
00:36:14,431 --> 00:36:17,160
But the way we've demonized cops as part
of this.

810
00:36:17,430 --> 00:36:18,121
I agree.
I mean,

811
00:36:18,121 --> 00:36:18,954
I see a lot of times people are just 
screaming about how evil cops are and 

812
00:36:21,271 --> 00:36:22,980
they're hunting people down in all of 
this stuff.

813
00:36:23,550 --> 00:36:26,250
I don't know a ton of cops,
but I knew some in New York and I know a

814
00:36:26,251 --> 00:36:27,084
couple here.
I mean generally they're trying to do 

815
00:36:29,640 --> 00:36:30,361
good.
Right.

816
00:36:30,361 --> 00:36:31,194
I mean,
do you have any experience in which 

817
00:36:33,090 --> 00:36:33,923
were,
have you ever been pulled over and had 

818
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:35,393
it?
I probably had been pulled over maybe 

819
00:36:37,141 --> 00:36:38,610
more than almost anybody.
You know,

820
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:42,150
I got my driver's license when I was 15 
and a half my learner's permit.

821
00:36:42,151 --> 00:36:42,984
And then when I was 16 I was able to 
drive by myself and I probably looked 

822
00:36:44,941 --> 00:36:47,910
like I was 12 so I got pulled over 
probably a hundred times.

823
00:36:48,180 --> 00:36:50,550
And with the exception of one or two 
instances,

824
00:36:50,940 --> 00:36:52,710
the encounter was brief and 
professional.

825
00:36:53,170 --> 00:36:54,003
Uh,
one time a cop told me to take my head 

826
00:36:54,901 --> 00:36:55,734
out of my ass.
That was the first time I got pulled 

827
00:36:57,541 --> 00:36:58,374
over by the way.
I was driving and there was a light 

828
00:37:00,211 --> 00:37:02,200
behind me and I knew I hadn't done 
anything,

829
00:37:02,370 --> 00:37:03,660
anything wrong.
So I just keep going.

830
00:37:04,110 --> 00:37:06,030
The guy pulled over and screamed at me 
and he goes,

831
00:37:06,031 --> 00:37:07,110
why don't you pull over?
And I said,

832
00:37:07,111 --> 00:37:07,944
what?
I said to you,

833
00:37:07,950 --> 00:37:08,660
well,
obviously I didn't,

834
00:37:08,660 --> 00:37:10,530
I didn't think I did anything wrong.
And he said,

835
00:37:10,531 --> 00:37:12,460
whenever you see some lights behind you,
you pull over,

836
00:37:12,490 --> 00:37:14,520
get your head out of your ass.
And he was right.

837
00:37:14,521 --> 00:37:18,570
I should've had my head head of I ask,
you know,

838
00:37:18,571 --> 00:37:19,650
um,
uh,

839
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:20,513
the instances in which cops kill blacks 
has declined 75% in the last 45 years 

840
00:37:25,471 --> 00:37:26,304
according to the CDC,
while the instances in which cops are 

841
00:37:28,920 --> 00:37:30,990
cops kill whites has pretty much flat 
lined.

842
00:37:31,230 --> 00:37:34,170
And so it's going down.
It is very,

843
00:37:34,200 --> 00:37:36,720
very,
very rare for the cop to kill anybody,

844
00:37:36,721 --> 00:37:40,470
let alone an unarmed black person of the
965,

845
00:37:40,471 --> 00:37:41,010
um,
uh,

846
00:37:41,010 --> 00:37:42,970
people that were killed by the police,
uh,

847
00:37:42,990 --> 00:37:43,823
in 2015,
less than 4% were white cops killing an 

848
00:37:46,531 --> 00:37:48,630
unarmed black man.
It is very rare.

849
00:37:48,750 --> 00:37:49,583
By contrast,
400 people were injured by lightning 

850
00:37:51,331 --> 00:37:53,790
last year,
but only 250 people were killed.

851
00:37:53,850 --> 00:37:56,040
Black people were killed by police.
So it's very,

852
00:37:56,041 --> 00:37:57,900
very rare.
So how much of this,

853
00:37:57,901 --> 00:38:00,120
I know you talk about fake news and I 
want to get to that,

854
00:38:00,121 --> 00:38:03,720
but how much of this is because the 
media is complicit in all of this.

855
00:38:03,721 --> 00:38:04,980
So for example,
just this morning,

856
00:38:04,981 --> 00:38:07,140
I think the Oscar nominations were put 
out.

857
00:38:07,141 --> 00:38:10,080
I haven't even seen them yet,
but apparently there are more minorities

858
00:38:10,081 --> 00:38:10,914
this time.
I guess there aren't some more Latinos 

859
00:38:12,600 --> 00:38:15,660
and a Dev Patel and some more black 
people.

860
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:16,793
And you know,
for the last couple of years there's 

861
00:38:17,581 --> 00:38:21,720
been this Oscars so white thing to me,
and I can only speak for myself,

862
00:38:21,721 --> 00:38:24,240
this is like keep your eye is just off 
the ball.

863
00:38:24,241 --> 00:38:25,074
You're just paying attention to the 
wrong thing where it's nice to have 

864
00:38:28,380 --> 00:38:29,213
people nominated for these things,
but they're irrelevant in the scheme of 

865
00:38:32,670 --> 00:38:35,880
what's important and what you should be 
caring about is education and all that.

866
00:38:35,881 --> 00:38:36,714
Right.
But the media has made such an 

867
00:38:37,301 --> 00:38:38,134
importance out of this that it's like 
it's getting the black community's eye 

868
00:38:41,291 --> 00:38:42,124
off what's actually important,
which would be education and family and 

869
00:38:44,471 --> 00:38:46,750
some of the others.
I couldn't agree with you more.

870
00:38:46,780 --> 00:38:48,910
Um,
I have an actor friend and I said,

871
00:38:48,940 --> 00:38:51,370
why is this important to you?
And he said,

872
00:38:51,371 --> 00:38:52,204
because it provides role models and 
enhances the self esteem of black 

873
00:38:55,361 --> 00:38:56,260
people.
That's what he said.

874
00:38:56,980 --> 00:38:57,813
I say,
are you aware that black boys and black 

875
00:38:59,471 --> 00:39:02,320
girls have higher self esteem than white
girls and white boys?

876
00:39:02,500 --> 00:39:03,333
This has been tested for decades.
It's been the case for a long time and 

877
00:39:05,711 --> 00:39:09,250
there are very,
very few Asian actors and actresses,

878
00:39:09,251 --> 00:39:10,060
yet,
uh,

879
00:39:10,060 --> 00:39:11,800
Asian Americans,
Japanese Americans,

880
00:39:11,801 --> 00:39:12,634
Chinese Americans and Korean Americans 
on a per capita basis make more money 

881
00:39:15,041 --> 00:39:16,420
than virtually anybody else in this 
country.

882
00:39:16,570 --> 00:39:18,340
So it's utterly irrelevant.
Yeah.

883
00:39:18,370 --> 00:39:21,070
And for us to pay attention to this,
and it's also not true.

884
00:39:21,910 --> 00:39:22,743
If you look at the last 15 years or so,
roughly 10% or so of the nominees for 

885
00:39:26,921 --> 00:39:28,540
the major categories have been black 
people.

886
00:39:28,541 --> 00:39:30,760
They've been a couple of years where 
there has been a shutout.

887
00:39:31,150 --> 00:39:32,310
Uh,
but um,

888
00:39:32,430 --> 00:39:33,440
add it all up.
It's,

889
00:39:33,441 --> 00:39:35,440
it's about parody with population.
Right.

890
00:39:35,441 --> 00:39:36,274
So that's the irony.
It actually within a couple of 

891
00:39:37,481 --> 00:39:38,314
percentage points,
it actually has been a party and Jamie 

892
00:39:41,140 --> 00:39:43,640
Foxx who got an Oscar for four re,
uh,

893
00:39:44,350 --> 00:39:45,280
said,
uh,

894
00:39:45,490 --> 00:39:46,181
in,
in,

895
00:39:46,181 --> 00:39:47,710
uh,
in connection with this Oscar.

896
00:39:48,430 --> 00:39:49,870
So white movement.
He said,

897
00:39:50,290 --> 00:39:53,410
act better,
be better,

898
00:39:54,010 --> 00:39:56,500
raise your game,
don't demand,

899
00:39:56,501 --> 00:39:57,760
don't yell,
don't scream.

900
00:39:57,761 --> 00:39:59,350
Get better,
act better.

901
00:39:59,470 --> 00:40:00,910
You got an Oscar and,
and,

902
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:01,793
and,
and I think part of the reason he said 

903
00:40:03,401 --> 00:40:06,070
that is because it kind of demeans his 
Oscar.

904
00:40:06,940 --> 00:40:08,160
Right?
Cause then it means like you're,

905
00:40:08,161 --> 00:40:10,270
you're complaining that the Oscars are 
so white.

906
00:40:10,271 --> 00:40:13,540
How did I get one?
I was lucky.

907
00:40:13,660 --> 00:40:14,560
Yeah.
Maybe just,

908
00:40:14,561 --> 00:40:16,210
maybe I was excellent.
Yeah.

909
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:20,170
So do you think that at times visibility
is important?

910
00:40:20,171 --> 00:40:21,100
So for example,
I had,

911
00:40:21,130 --> 00:40:23,950
I've had jack a Harry on here.
She was the first black woman.

912
00:40:23,951 --> 00:40:27,280
I think she wasn't for best supporting 
actress in two to seven,

913
00:40:27,700 --> 00:40:28,690
uh,
around,

914
00:40:28,691 --> 00:40:31,810
I guess it's around 1989 or so at that 
time.

915
00:40:31,811 --> 00:40:32,644
Do you think that a certain amount of is
visibility may have been more important 

916
00:40:34,961 --> 00:40:36,550
than it is now?
Like,

917
00:40:36,551 --> 00:40:39,910
cause finally a black person did it even
if you don't think that the thing in and

918
00:40:39,911 --> 00:40:41,710
of itself is,
is important?

919
00:40:41,770 --> 00:40:42,603
I don't think so.
I remember some years ago there was an 

920
00:40:44,711 --> 00:40:45,580
Olympic,
uh,

921
00:40:45,640 --> 00:40:46,473
blacks,
uh,

922
00:40:46,500 --> 00:40:49,120
skier named Debbie.
Debbie Thomas,

923
00:40:49,121 --> 00:40:51,760
I believe was her last name.
And she was the first,

924
00:40:51,790 --> 00:40:52,623
um,
uh,

925
00:40:52,630 --> 00:40:54,730
Black Olympian and in,
uh,

926
00:40:54,750 --> 00:40:55,720
in,
in ice skating.

927
00:40:56,260 --> 00:40:59,410
And she was constantly ask,
who are your role models?

928
00:40:59,411 --> 00:41:01,000
Who are your role models?
Who inspired you?

929
00:41:01,540 --> 00:41:02,830
And finally to me,
out of,

930
00:41:02,860 --> 00:41:04,390
out of exasperation,
she said,

931
00:41:04,720 --> 00:41:07,930
I don't need to see somebody black do 
something before I think I can do it.

932
00:41:08,950 --> 00:41:11,080
And that's how I feel.
If I want to do something,

933
00:41:11,110 --> 00:41:13,150
uh,
w w what's holding me back from doing it

934
00:41:13,151 --> 00:41:17,350
other than my own insecurities or,
or,

935
00:41:17,360 --> 00:41:17,750
or,
or,

936
00:41:17,750 --> 00:41:19,780
or inadequacies.
Just get up and make it happen.

937
00:41:19,900 --> 00:41:20,733
Yeah.
How exhausting is this conversation to 

938
00:41:22,061 --> 00:41:22,894
you?
I don't mean this literal conversation 

939
00:41:23,771 --> 00:41:25,540
right now,
but just this thing,

940
00:41:25,541 --> 00:41:26,374
you know,
so much of what you talk about has to 

941
00:41:27,411 --> 00:41:29,830
do,
unfortunately be framed around something

942
00:41:29,831 --> 00:41:32,170
that you don't even think is,
is real.

943
00:41:32,230 --> 00:41:33,063
You know what I mean?
It's something that you think should be 

944
00:41:34,431 --> 00:41:36,770
put behind us that actually is behind 
us.

945
00:41:36,771 --> 00:41:39,920
And yet you have to talk about it a lot.
Just on a personal note,

946
00:41:39,921 --> 00:41:41,660
how does that feel for you?
It doesn't bother me.

947
00:41:41,661 --> 00:41:42,494
I,
I think there's a lot of a feeling that 

948
00:41:43,851 --> 00:41:46,100
race and racism remain major problems in
America.

949
00:41:46,490 --> 00:41:49,970
Uh,
and I think that that you're approaching

950
00:41:49,971 --> 00:41:50,804
this with,
with,

951
00:41:50,870 --> 00:41:52,460
with sincerity and,
and,

952
00:41:52,461 --> 00:41:54,320
and,
and since and real concern.

953
00:41:54,590 --> 00:41:55,423
Uh,
I just don't think it's that big of a 

954
00:41:56,001 --> 00:41:56,834
deal.
Yeah.

955
00:41:56,930 --> 00:41:57,763
By the way,
I've emailed duray Mckesson [inaudible] 

956
00:41:58,970 --> 00:41:59,803
who's the leader?
I think the quasi leader of black lives 

957
00:42:01,131 --> 00:42:02,030
matter.
He hasn't responded,

958
00:42:02,031 --> 00:42:03,530
but I will,
I will ask him again.

959
00:42:03,650 --> 00:42:05,450
So I'm not doing it.
I'm not just playing favorites.

960
00:42:06,110 --> 00:42:06,990
I'm just putting that out.
No,

961
00:42:07,050 --> 00:42:07,883
no,
no problem.

962
00:42:08,270 --> 00:42:10,910
Um,
this is America.

963
00:42:11,160 --> 00:42:11,460
There.

964
00:42:11,460 --> 00:42:14,750
There are Cubans who are braving shark 
infested waters to get here.

965
00:42:15,020 --> 00:42:17,120
There are people from Central America 
coming up here.

966
00:42:17,330 --> 00:42:18,163
Why do people come here?
Why does so many people want to come to 

967
00:42:19,761 --> 00:42:22,940
America and is because it is the land of
the free and the home of the brave.

968
00:42:23,150 --> 00:42:23,983
It is a place where you can go from 
nothing to something a faster than it 

969
00:42:27,231 --> 00:42:30,800
anytime,
anywhere in all of human history.

970
00:42:31,070 --> 00:42:31,903
That's why we're here and to me again,
you are are almost giving the fourth 

971
00:42:36,961 --> 00:42:39,170
finger to all the people fought,
struggled,

972
00:42:39,171 --> 00:42:40,004
worked hard and died for people to sit 
around in 2017 in Bitch Moan and whine 

973
00:42:43,911 --> 00:42:45,220
about race and racism.
Yeah.

974
00:42:45,230 --> 00:42:47,690
I suspect I know your answer to this,
but what do you make of all these people

975
00:42:47,691 --> 00:42:48,524
that now want to look back on history 
and label everyone racist from back 

976
00:42:52,131 --> 00:42:53,600
then?
You know I was at Monte Cello,

977
00:42:53,601 --> 00:42:54,434
which was Thomas Jefferson's home,
Thomas Jefferson who owned slaves who 

978
00:42:58,010 --> 00:43:00,670
was sleeping with at least one sleep,
I think several who they,

979
00:43:00,920 --> 00:43:03,170
by the way at Monte Cello,
I took the tour.

980
00:43:03,240 --> 00:43:04,730
There's only about a year and a half 
ago,

981
00:43:05,090 --> 00:43:07,280
they fully owned up to everything.
They did not.

982
00:43:07,340 --> 00:43:09,080
I thought it was incredible what they 
did.

983
00:43:09,290 --> 00:43:10,123
They said this man was writing the laws 
to free the slaves at the same time he 

984
00:43:14,751 --> 00:43:17,120
was sleeping with the slaves,
which I think you could probably make an

985
00:43:17,121 --> 00:43:17,954
argument was rape in a certain respect 
because they weren't equals right now 

986
00:43:21,140 --> 00:43:23,570
I'm not saying he's a rapist in the 
conventional sense,

987
00:43:23,571 --> 00:43:25,640
but you can.
I can see that argument being made,

988
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:28,350
but what about that concept that we're 
going to look back at?

989
00:43:28,360 --> 00:43:29,193
What the,
I think the left is now trying to do is 

990
00:43:30,111 --> 00:43:30,944
look at all of our founding fathers and 
take them out of the give our 2017 

991
00:43:35,510 --> 00:43:38,840
morality to them who lived very complex 
lives.

992
00:43:38,841 --> 00:43:39,674
I mean without Thomas Jefferson,
the slaves do not get fried as quickly 

993
00:43:42,201 --> 00:43:43,034
as they did.

994
00:43:43,700 --> 00:43:44,533
Well.
I think the idea of going back and 

995
00:43:46,311 --> 00:43:48,860
airbrushing history and looking at 
history through the,

996
00:43:48,890 --> 00:43:52,520
through the filter of today's a morality
is pretty silly.

997
00:43:52,820 --> 00:43:56,720
I think all a state can be.
It's just in its own time.

998
00:43:56,810 --> 00:43:59,090
And that's what we're trying to be 
trying to do right now.

999
00:43:59,540 --> 00:44:00,373
Uh,
and people are right to call a slavery 

1000
00:44:02,301 --> 00:44:04,280
Americans,
America's original sin.

1001
00:44:04,490 --> 00:44:06,410
But without a compromise,
you wouldn't have had an America.

1002
00:44:06,860 --> 00:44:07,693
And,
um,

1003
00:44:07,790 --> 00:44:09,680
and there was 750,000
people,

1004
00:44:09,681 --> 00:44:12,410
both sides who died in order to free the
slaves.

1005
00:44:13,010 --> 00:44:14,780
And people don't really have an 
understanding of,

1006
00:44:14,870 --> 00:44:15,590
of,
of,

1007
00:44:15,590 --> 00:44:16,520
of the,
the,

1008
00:44:16,521 --> 00:44:18,740
the scale of the sacrifice that people 
made.

1009
00:44:19,640 --> 00:44:20,473
750,000
people at a time when this country was 

1010
00:44:22,161 --> 00:44:25,790
just 10% the size of what it is.
So that's like 7.5

1011
00:44:25,791 --> 00:44:27,720
million people dying,
uh,

1012
00:44:27,890 --> 00:44:30,880
in order for there to be an outcome with
slaves are freed and that's the,

1013
00:44:30,890 --> 00:44:33,060
and are the people that died and not the
ones who've been injured.

1014
00:44:33,060 --> 00:44:35,000
It was a horrific thing,
uh,

1015
00:44:35,130 --> 00:44:36,660
that,
that America went through.

1016
00:44:36,890 --> 00:44:37,471
Uh,
and,

1017
00:44:37,471 --> 00:44:39,990
and on the other side comes the 13th 
amendment,

1018
00:44:39,991 --> 00:44:41,520
the 14th Amendment,
the 15th Amendment,

1019
00:44:41,920 --> 00:44:43,240
uh,
the civil rights movement and,

1020
00:44:43,241 --> 00:44:44,790
and all the things that have happened 
since then,

1021
00:44:45,220 --> 00:44:47,490
but that,
this was a country they went to war over

1022
00:44:47,491 --> 00:44:48,650
this proposition.
Yeah.

1023
00:44:48,750 --> 00:44:49,583
What,
what do you make of this intersectional 

1024
00:44:50,461 --> 00:44:51,294
thing that we have going on now?
And I think we saw a lot of it at the 

1025
00:44:52,891 --> 00:44:54,310
woman's March,
this,

1026
00:44:54,330 --> 00:44:57,240
this past weekend where there's a 
certain amount of people that are trying

1027
00:44:57,241 --> 00:44:58,074
to conflate trans issues with black 
issues and then Muslim issues with 

1028
00:45:02,970 --> 00:45:05,490
women's issues.
And just this whole thing where,

1029
00:45:05,590 --> 00:45:06,423
you know,
I talk about all the time this 

1030
00:45:06,601 --> 00:45:07,434
oppression Olympics and now we're all,
they're all tied together by this 

1031
00:45:10,451 --> 00:45:11,284
oppression,
but they all have to kind of beat each 

1032
00:45:13,081 --> 00:45:14,700
other and oppression to be the winner.

1033
00:45:15,060 --> 00:45:16,710
This is a toxic mess,
Huh?

1034
00:45:16,900 --> 00:45:17,551
It is.
It's,

1035
00:45:17,551 --> 00:45:18,384
it's a,
it's what I call the victim correct 

1036
00:45:19,321 --> 00:45:22,000
culture where everybody has a grievance,
uh,

1037
00:45:22,050 --> 00:45:25,140
and everybody's making a demand on the 
government to solve that grievance,

1038
00:45:25,420 --> 00:45:26,430
uh,
when in fact,

1039
00:45:26,450 --> 00:45:27,283
uh,
we have far more in common than we have 

1040
00:45:28,291 --> 00:45:32,580
apart and we ought to celebrate our 
similarities and we're not doing that.

1041
00:45:32,610 --> 00:45:34,170
Okay.
So let's move to trump then.

1042
00:45:34,480 --> 00:45:36,720
I think what you said,
there's an interesting segway to trump.

1043
00:45:37,050 --> 00:45:41,790
So there seems to be this feeling that 
the white supremacist back,

1044
00:45:42,090 --> 00:45:44,200
they're back in business.
And it should be,

1045
00:45:45,040 --> 00:45:46,830
and it's because of trump.
So I saw this.

1046
00:45:46,831 --> 00:45:49,140
Do you see this video of this Guy 
Richard Spencer,

1047
00:45:49,141 --> 00:45:51,000
who's The alt right guy and you got to 
get in hunched?

1048
00:45:51,040 --> 00:45:54,720
He got punched.
I tweeted out that I,

1049
00:45:54,721 --> 00:45:58,500
this guy has obviously bad ideas.
I've had family members on both sides of

1050
00:45:58,501 --> 00:45:59,790
my family killed in the Holocaust.

1051
00:45:59,790 --> 00:46:02,520
So I am not a Nazi sympathizer in any 
way,

1052
00:46:02,850 --> 00:46:03,683
but I have to defend his right to free 
speech without being punched because 

1053
00:46:07,650 --> 00:46:09,660
that's the whole point.
You can't just defend it when it's easy.

1054
00:46:09,661 --> 00:46:10,950
You got to defend it when you don't want
to.

1055
00:46:10,951 --> 00:46:13,560
And that's,
but I saw a lot of people on the left,

1056
00:46:13,561 --> 00:46:14,394
a lot of famous people,
a lot of people with a lot of 

1057
00:46:15,481 --> 00:46:16,171
influencing.
No,

1058
00:46:16,171 --> 00:46:17,004
it's okay to punch Nazis,
which if you just follow their logic 

1059
00:46:19,381 --> 00:46:20,214
through,
well he could have killed him cause you 

1060
00:46:21,121 --> 00:46:21,954
could accidentally kill somebody.
And then if it's okay to punch a random 

1061
00:46:25,111 --> 00:46:28,320
person because of their beliefs,
can we blow up his car?

1062
00:46:28,321 --> 00:46:30,840
Can we bombed his house?
I mean this is a,

1063
00:46:30,850 --> 00:46:33,150
this is a horrifically slippery slope,
right?

1064
00:46:33,210 --> 00:46:34,050
Oh,
of course it is.

1065
00:46:34,080 --> 00:46:35,130
Uh,
is it okay for me to,

1066
00:46:35,131 --> 00:46:36,330
to,
to burn up a building,

1067
00:46:36,350 --> 00:46:38,190
uh,
because I'm unhappy with,

1068
00:46:38,340 --> 00:46:41,250
because of the way the police treat me 
are riots perfectly.

1069
00:46:41,250 --> 00:46:42,110
Okay.
Uh,

1070
00:46:42,280 --> 00:46:43,113
would it be okay if somebody walked up 
to John Lewis and punched him because 

1071
00:46:45,210 --> 00:46:48,090
they feel that John Lewis should have 
attended the Donald Trump inaugural?

1072
00:46:48,270 --> 00:46:49,590
Where do we,
where do we go with this?

1073
00:46:49,591 --> 00:46:51,030
Are you kidding me?
Yeah.

1074
00:46:51,420 --> 00:46:52,560
And,
and believe me,

1075
00:46:52,561 --> 00:46:53,394
it would have been a huge story if that 
had been somebody like John Lewis who 

1076
00:46:55,951 --> 00:46:58,050
had been punched as opposed to this 
Spencer Guy,

1077
00:46:58,370 --> 00:46:59,880
uh,
that the media doesn't care about.

1078
00:46:59,910 --> 00:47:01,260
Uh,
and feels is loathsome.

1079
00:47:01,290 --> 00:47:02,123
I understand that,
but I would've thought that would've 

1080
00:47:04,140 --> 00:47:06,060
been a little more coverage of it,
but there wasn't very much.

1081
00:47:06,090 --> 00:47:07,940
Yeah.
So I know a certain amount of people are

1082
00:47:07,941 --> 00:47:09,030
gonna Watch this and go,
wait a minute,

1083
00:47:09,031 --> 00:47:09,864
wait a minute.
Here's a black guy and a Jew somehow 

1084
00:47:11,521 --> 00:47:13,320
defending a Nazis,
right to free speech.

1085
00:47:13,321 --> 00:47:14,154
He wants to,
I'm pretty sure he'd want to kick both 

1086
00:47:15,001 --> 00:47:18,060
of us out of the country or something 
close to that.

1087
00:47:18,480 --> 00:47:20,160
But it's tough to have principles,
right?

1088
00:47:20,190 --> 00:47:21,023
I mean it isn't that,
isn't that the crux of what you're 

1089
00:47:22,081 --> 00:47:22,914
saying?
Basically the through line of all of 

1090
00:47:23,721 --> 00:47:26,840
this is you got to have some principles,
wasn't it voltaire who said,

1091
00:47:26,850 --> 00:47:27,683
I guess we have what you've said,
but I would defend to my death your 

1092
00:47:29,501 --> 00:47:30,334
right to say it.
I mean we're talking about principles 

1093
00:47:31,421 --> 00:47:32,080
here.
Yeah,

1094
00:47:32,080 --> 00:47:32,970
free speech.
So,

1095
00:47:33,220 --> 00:47:34,053
and by the way,
it's not unlawful to it to hate 

1096
00:47:35,351 --> 00:47:36,520
somebody.
You can hate somebody.

1097
00:47:36,670 --> 00:47:39,160
As you pointed out earlier,
you can't put your hand on that person,

1098
00:47:39,310 --> 00:47:41,830
but you have every right to dislike 
somebody for whatever reason you want.

1099
00:47:41,890 --> 00:47:42,723
Yeah.
So I sense that a lot of people think 

1100
00:47:44,441 --> 00:47:47,620
though that white supremacy is back,
that they,

1101
00:47:47,920 --> 00:47:51,160
that they feel that there was a link to 
trump somehow.

1102
00:47:51,280 --> 00:47:52,113
I don't really see that link.
But there there was a link that somehow 

1103
00:47:54,701 --> 00:47:59,510
he unearthed this and now pepe the frog 
and Rob Bay,

1104
00:47:59,511 --> 00:48:03,220
the monkey and the white supremacists,
they've been unearthed and now they feel

1105
00:48:03,221 --> 00:48:04,054
it's okay.

1106
00:48:04,240 --> 00:48:06,940
So their only response is to hit back.
I would argue,

1107
00:48:06,941 --> 00:48:07,774
which I think you would argue,
which is your beat them with better 

1108
00:48:09,011 --> 00:48:09,844
ideas.
Let this 80th talk and guess what he's 

1109
00:48:11,771 --> 00:48:14,860
going to show what a fraudulent bigot he
actually is.

1110
00:48:14,950 --> 00:48:15,940
Right.
Um,

1111
00:48:16,630 --> 00:48:19,770
but do you think there's any resurgence 
of actual white supremacy?

1112
00:48:19,780 --> 00:48:21,640
I mean,
is that a real issue?

1113
00:48:22,660 --> 00:48:23,740
I'm not saying it.
Uh,

1114
00:48:23,890 --> 00:48:25,990
Donald Trump got a higher percentage of 
the black vote.

1115
00:48:25,991 --> 00:48:27,880
They,
Mitt Romney did and John Mccain did.

1116
00:48:27,881 --> 00:48:30,280
He got a higher percentage of the 
Hispanic vote than Mitt Romney did.

1117
00:48:30,670 --> 00:48:33,010
Um,
he got a smaller percentage of the white

1118
00:48:33,011 --> 00:48:33,740
vote,
then his,

1119
00:48:33,740 --> 00:48:34,720
um,
his predecessor,

1120
00:48:34,750 --> 00:48:35,640
then the,
the,

1121
00:48:35,641 --> 00:48:36,210
the,
the,

1122
00:48:36,210 --> 00:48:39,820
the Republican rand beforehand.
So I'm not seeing it.

1123
00:48:39,850 --> 00:48:42,530
I am seeing a resurgence in the,
uh,

1124
00:48:42,660 --> 00:48:45,740
uh,
assertion that white supremacy is back,

1125
00:48:45,760 --> 00:48:47,890
but I'm not seeing it.
Look,

1126
00:48:47,930 --> 00:48:49,450
um,
one of Donald Trump's,

1127
00:48:49,451 --> 00:48:50,284
um,
a surrogate's was doctor Ben Carson is 

1128
00:48:52,721 --> 00:48:53,680
doctor Ben Carson.

1129
00:48:53,710 --> 00:48:54,543
Uh,
somebody that's going to cozy up to 

1130
00:48:55,811 --> 00:48:57,670
somebody who is a white supremacist.
Uh,

1131
00:48:57,671 --> 00:48:59,590
one of my friends,
Steven Miller,

1132
00:48:59,850 --> 00:49:01,600
uh,
is the young,

1133
00:49:01,660 --> 00:49:02,493
uh,
speech writer who wrote Donald Trump's 

1134
00:49:03,731 --> 00:49:06,250
inaugural speech and wrote his rnc 
speech.

1135
00:49:06,340 --> 00:49:09,250
He's about 30 in his early thirties.
I've known him since he was a teenager.

1136
00:49:09,490 --> 00:49:10,323
He is not a,
somebody is going to work for it for a 

1137
00:49:12,040 --> 00:49:13,480
white supremacy.
He happens to be a Jew.

1138
00:49:13,940 --> 00:49:18,940
Um,
so donald trump's a wrong vehicle to peg

1139
00:49:19,091 --> 00:49:19,924
that on.
And John Lewis said that he was not 

1140
00:49:22,391 --> 00:49:23,224
going to attend his,
his inauguration the first time in all 

1141
00:49:25,511 --> 00:49:26,344
of his years being in Congress.
He's not going to to attend the 

1142
00:49:27,791 --> 00:49:29,620
presidential inauguration.
False.

1143
00:49:29,690 --> 00:49:30,401
If he,
he,

1144
00:49:30,401 --> 00:49:32,680
he did not attend George W Bush's 
inauguration.

1145
00:49:32,970 --> 00:49:34,360
Now with George W.
Bush a Nazi.

1146
00:49:34,380 --> 00:49:35,530
What's he,
what's he a fascist?

1147
00:49:35,531 --> 00:49:37,450
Was he a racist?
What was your argument?

1148
00:49:37,451 --> 00:49:38,170
Mr.
Lewis,

1149
00:49:38,170 --> 00:49:39,003
if he were here,
I'd ask him for not attending George W 

1150
00:49:40,930 --> 00:49:41,650
Bush's inauguration.

1151
00:49:41,650 --> 00:49:44,160
I understand donald trump's,
but explaining George W.

1152
00:49:44,160 --> 00:49:44,980
Bush to me.
Right.

1153
00:49:44,980 --> 00:49:45,813
So is that the crazy position that a lot
of people have painted themselves into 

1154
00:49:48,641 --> 00:49:52,240
now they've screamed and ranted and 
raved that trump and this whole movement

1155
00:49:52,270 --> 00:49:54,820
is,
is vial and racist and all this stuff.

1156
00:49:55,120 --> 00:49:57,310
We're now,
if he does any good,

1157
00:49:57,760 --> 00:49:58,593
they're going to have to lash out in 
crazy ways because you can't have a guy 

1158
00:50:01,481 --> 00:50:03,640
that you've been calling Hitler for a 
year.

1159
00:50:03,641 --> 00:50:06,580
Suddenly you can't suddenly admit that 
he's doing some good stuff,

1160
00:50:06,581 --> 00:50:07,414
right?
So they've put themselves in a really 

1161
00:50:08,681 --> 00:50:11,020
tight intellectual box here.
I think they have,

1162
00:50:11,021 --> 00:50:13,960
and again,
Donald Trump is a bad vehicle,

1163
00:50:14,260 --> 00:50:14,651
uh,
to,

1164
00:50:14,651 --> 00:50:17,650
to do that with because if you look at 
some of his points of view,

1165
00:50:17,680 --> 00:50:19,930
they are quite populous and quite left 
wing.

1166
00:50:20,230 --> 00:50:23,710
He and Bernie Sanders were completing 
each other's sentences on free trade.

1167
00:50:24,190 --> 00:50:25,023
And when a Donald Trump had the 
interview with 60 minutes and he was 

1168
00:50:27,471 --> 00:50:31,430
asked about same sex marriage,
he said it was settled law.

1169
00:50:31,640 --> 00:50:33,560
He could have said the same thing he 
said about abortion,

1170
00:50:33,561 --> 00:50:34,394
which was I'm going to put on a justice 
who ultimately would turn over Roe v 

1171
00:50:37,100 --> 00:50:37,933
Wade.
He didn't say that,

1172
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:38,833
but that's really what,
what,

1173
00:50:38,900 --> 00:50:39,733
what he wants to happen.
But he could have said that regarding 

1174
00:50:41,571 --> 00:50:43,370
gay marriage because,
uh,

1175
00:50:43,580 --> 00:50:47,150
gay marriage is less settled law then 
abortion.

1176
00:50:47,480 --> 00:50:48,313
Uh,
abortion has been on the books since 

1177
00:50:49,341 --> 00:50:50,174
1973.
The gay marriage decision just now came 

1178
00:50:51,861 --> 00:50:52,551
down.
Oh,

1179
00:50:52,551 --> 00:50:53,384
so your argument is that he's actually 
more for gay marriage than he is for 

1180
00:50:56,001 --> 00:50:59,360
abortion on gay marriage.
He said to Steve Croft,

1181
00:50:59,570 --> 00:51:02,960
that issue has been settled.
Really he could have said,

1182
00:51:02,990 --> 00:51:04,570
I'm going to put on justices that,
that,

1183
00:51:04,650 --> 00:51:07,040
that we'll look at the constitution and 
we'll have all these issues.

1184
00:51:07,041 --> 00:51:09,470
Go back to the state like abortion.
But he didn't,

1185
00:51:09,471 --> 00:51:11,570
he said same sex marriage is settled 
law,

1186
00:51:11,571 --> 00:51:12,980
which was his way,
in my opinion,

1187
00:51:13,220 --> 00:51:15,590
of signaling to all of the people in the
country,

1188
00:51:15,920 --> 00:51:19,310
especially his critics that I am okay 
with same sex marriage.

1189
00:51:19,670 --> 00:51:20,660
And on,
as I mentioned,

1190
00:51:20,661 --> 00:51:21,890
on and on,
on free trade,

1191
00:51:21,891 --> 00:51:23,020
he and Bernie Sanders were,
were,

1192
00:51:23,030 --> 00:51:23,863
were identical and on infrastructure.
He wants a trillion dollar 

1193
00:51:27,681 --> 00:51:28,740
infrastructure,
uh,

1194
00:51:29,090 --> 00:51:30,290
investment.
Uh,

1195
00:51:30,291 --> 00:51:32,330
Chuck Schumer just now said that he's 
okay with that.

1196
00:51:32,360 --> 00:51:34,010
Yeah.
When you have chuck Schumer smiling,

1197
00:51:34,011 --> 00:51:35,870
it seems to me you ought to be worried.
But the point is,

1198
00:51:36,200 --> 00:51:37,033
these are the kinds of things,
and they felt that Obama's stimulus was 

1199
00:51:39,981 --> 00:51:42,500
too small and this is bigger than that.
So they're,

1200
00:51:42,560 --> 00:51:43,393
they're giddy over all over all of that.
So why Donald Trump is engendering all 

1201
00:51:46,881 --> 00:51:49,640
of this hostility when he has so many a 
centrist,

1202
00:51:49,641 --> 00:51:51,530
if not leveling point of view is beyond 
me.

1203
00:51:51,770 --> 00:51:52,603
Well,
I think it has to do is just the way he 

1204
00:51:53,241 --> 00:51:54,690
speaks.
I think you know,

1205
00:51:54,800 --> 00:51:55,633
my concern about him from day one,
as I've said a thousand times in that 

1206
00:51:57,710 --> 00:51:59,360
year,
I don't know what his moral center is,

1207
00:51:59,570 --> 00:52:00,980
but I don't know that,
you know what a lot of these guys,

1208
00:52:00,981 --> 00:52:04,280
moral center is at the end of the day,
a lot of them speak a lot clearer.

1209
00:52:04,280 --> 00:52:05,780
So you to,
you think you know it,

1210
00:52:05,840 --> 00:52:07,100
right?
And then you don't know it.

1211
00:52:07,230 --> 00:52:09,710
You'd probably argue that about Obama,
but for trump,

1212
00:52:09,711 --> 00:52:11,240
I don't know what it is.
That being said,

1213
00:52:11,241 --> 00:52:15,410
I think the answer to your question is I
think the left no longer has the ability

1214
00:52:15,411 --> 00:52:17,600
to understand the difference between 
words and actions.

1215
00:52:17,840 --> 00:52:18,673
So they see his gruff language and some 
poorly phrase things and that he speaks 

1216
00:52:23,090 --> 00:52:26,450
not that well,
and then they think that translates into

1217
00:52:26,451 --> 00:52:27,284
action when in fact he actually did a 
lot of things that brought them more 

1218
00:52:29,841 --> 00:52:30,674
center.
I think it goes back to what we said 

1219
00:52:32,241 --> 00:52:33,920
earlier and there's just a lack of 
critical thinking.

1220
00:52:33,921 --> 00:52:36,180
I think we are at the end of your name.
Uh,

1221
00:52:36,260 --> 00:52:38,240
all of a sudden there are certain sets 
of,

1222
00:52:38,260 --> 00:52:41,870
of views that people assume you have a 
and they,

1223
00:52:41,930 --> 00:52:43,070
they go after those views.

1224
00:52:43,310 --> 00:52:45,610
Um,
I look at his,

1225
00:52:45,620 --> 00:52:46,820
his,
his moral center.

1226
00:52:46,821 --> 00:52:49,260
I look at Donald Trump's family.
Uh,

1227
00:52:49,310 --> 00:52:52,100
these kids adore him.
He's had three different marriages.

1228
00:52:52,130 --> 00:52:53,900
It's complicated to pull all that stuff 
together.

1229
00:52:54,170 --> 00:52:55,410
Three different marriages,
uh,

1230
00:52:55,580 --> 00:52:56,413
children from all three of the marriages
and they all get along and they all 

1231
00:52:58,851 --> 00:53:01,070
worked up their father.
How bad a guy can he be?

1232
00:53:01,730 --> 00:53:02,181
You know,
it's funny,

1233
00:53:02,181 --> 00:53:03,014
I had Donald Trump jr on my Sirius xm 
show talking about how he was for gay 

1234
00:53:07,341 --> 00:53:08,174
marriage is about a little bit before it
got passed it about let's say three 

1235
00:53:10,791 --> 00:53:12,260
years ago,
four years ago.

1236
00:53:12,370 --> 00:53:14,450
I'm talking about how he personally was 
for gay marriage,

1237
00:53:14,451 --> 00:53:16,730
even though his dad was in it and that 
his dad said,

1238
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:18,590
you go out and tell people whatever you 
want.

1239
00:53:18,650 --> 00:53:21,280
So I thought that that's actually a nice
marker of,

1240
00:53:21,410 --> 00:53:23,840
of sort of what a father should be.

1241
00:53:24,740 --> 00:53:27,360
Do you his authoritarian side at all 
because as you said,

1242
00:53:27,361 --> 00:53:28,194
small l libertarian,
so you want the government to scale 

1243
00:53:30,211 --> 00:53:32,250
back.
I sense he is going,

1244
00:53:32,251 --> 00:53:32,611
he,
yeah,

1245
00:53:32,611 --> 00:53:33,444
he's going to lower taxes and they were 
already doing some stuff with 

1246
00:53:34,801 --> 00:53:36,660
regulations that you're probably four 
and that kind of stuff,

1247
00:53:36,990 --> 00:53:40,650
but do you sense there could be an 
authoritarian side even controlling what

1248
00:53:40,651 --> 00:53:44,130
businesses can do overseas and that kind
of stuff that you may not like?

1249
00:53:44,850 --> 00:53:45,683
There are.
There are things he said that I don't 

1250
00:53:46,801 --> 00:53:47,551
like.
Uh,

1251
00:53:47,551 --> 00:53:49,350
I don't know that I would label them 
authoritarian.

1252
00:53:49,351 --> 00:53:51,450
I would label them as stupid.
For example,

1253
00:53:52,110 --> 00:53:52,943
saying I'm going to put on a 30 or 40% 
tariff on goods that come in for this 

1254
00:53:55,831 --> 00:53:57,660
country.
If you've left the country and started a

1255
00:53:57,661 --> 00:53:58,494
factory,
all you're doing is discriminating 

1256
00:54:00,601 --> 00:54:03,060
against cheap prices and hurting 
American consumers.

1257
00:54:03,390 --> 00:54:04,223
I as a business person have an 
obligation to maximize shareholder 

1258
00:54:08,370 --> 00:54:09,203
return.

1259
00:54:09,300 --> 00:54:10,133
And if my biggest cost is labor and I 
can go somewhere else and build my 

1260
00:54:13,471 --> 00:54:14,520
widgets,
uh,

1261
00:54:14,521 --> 00:54:16,650
for less money,
I have an obligation to do that.

1262
00:54:16,651 --> 00:54:18,180
And if I don't do that,
my competitor will.

1263
00:54:18,540 --> 00:54:21,480
And for a business person like Donald 
Trump to tell another business person,

1264
00:54:21,481 --> 00:54:25,440
I'm going to punish you for it,
for seeking profits to me is outrageous.

1265
00:54:25,680 --> 00:54:26,513
I understand and support his idea that a
lot of the reason people go overseas 

1266
00:54:30,870 --> 00:54:33,900
because we have onerous regulations and 
high corporate tax.

1267
00:54:34,020 --> 00:54:36,900
Once you lower the regulations and lower
the corporate taxation,

1268
00:54:37,080 --> 00:54:40,560
and I had a CEO had made a calculation 
that I can make more money by putting my

1269
00:54:40,561 --> 00:54:43,950
factory I in a third world country.
How dare you tax me for,

1270
00:54:43,951 --> 00:54:45,810
for doing that.
We'll get you the right to do that.

1271
00:54:45,840 --> 00:54:47,580
Right.
So you would basically argue that if you

1272
00:54:47,581 --> 00:54:48,414
lowered the corporate tax rates,
did everything he could to unregulate 

1273
00:54:50,731 --> 00:54:51,564
business here,
you wouldn't need that tax on the 

1274
00:54:54,451 --> 00:54:58,110
overseas stuff because it would be 
humming and pairing nicely here.

1275
00:54:58,420 --> 00:54:59,253
You wouldn't,
you wouldn't need to leave the country 

1276
00:55:00,300 --> 00:55:02,190
to set up a factory because you would 
stay here.

1277
00:55:02,510 --> 00:55:03,343
What we have right now are all these 
environmental rules and regulations 

1278
00:55:05,341 --> 00:55:08,610
designed to fight climate change.
We have a very high corporate tax rate,

1279
00:55:08,611 --> 00:55:10,780
the highest in the industrialized world.
Uh,

1280
00:55:10,830 --> 00:55:14,160
you deal with those kinds of things and 
you'll take away the incentive that some

1281
00:55:14,161 --> 00:55:16,590
ceos have a to move outside of the 
country.

1282
00:55:16,770 --> 00:55:21,230
But so when you take all those away and 
you lower the lower the,

1283
00:55:21,231 --> 00:55:23,520
uh,
the regulatory burdens that ceos have to

1284
00:55:23,521 --> 00:55:25,620
deal with and they still want to put a 
factory somewhere,

1285
00:55:25,890 --> 00:55:29,400
you have absolutely no right to stop 
them from doing that,

1286
00:55:29,760 --> 00:55:30,593
in my opinion.
Do you think it's hilarious how we look 

1287
00:55:31,861 --> 00:55:34,710
at certain companies that do the exact 
same things as other companies?

1288
00:55:34,711 --> 00:55:35,311
Some are.
Okay.

1289
00:55:35,311 --> 00:55:36,420
Some are.
So for example,

1290
00:55:36,421 --> 00:55:40,100
trump made his ties in Mexico,
which I kept saying all along,

1291
00:55:40,110 --> 00:55:41,220
this isn't something you're getting him 
on.

1292
00:55:41,220 --> 00:55:41,580
He,
you're,

1293
00:55:41,580 --> 00:55:44,640
he's proving the point.
He's proving the point that it's cheaper

1294
00:55:44,641 --> 00:55:45,474
to do there,
change the regulations and then he 

1295
00:55:46,741 --> 00:55:47,574
wouldn't have to at the same time a 
company and trump was mocked 

1296
00:55:49,861 --> 00:55:51,420
relentlessly for doing that.
Right.

1297
00:55:52,050 --> 00:55:52,883
At the same time,
apple designs their stuff in Cupertino 

1298
00:55:55,621 --> 00:55:58,590
as they say,
and it's all made in China and they hide

1299
00:55:58,591 --> 00:55:59,424
all kinds of stuff tax wise.
But we're all walking around with 

1300
00:56:01,171 --> 00:56:03,510
iphones.
How come some companies are able to,

1301
00:56:03,760 --> 00:56:06,210
that's just the cool factor of apple.
I think so.

1302
00:56:06,211 --> 00:56:07,044
And uh,
I think Al Gore was on the board of 

1303
00:56:08,431 --> 00:56:11,280
directors of apple at one point or if he
isn't now,

1304
00:56:11,640 --> 00:56:13,260
uh,
and here they are manufacturing stuff in

1305
00:56:13,261 --> 00:56:14,700
China.
Um,

1306
00:56:14,940 --> 00:56:16,740
yeah.
Some companies have better pr than other

1307
00:56:16,741 --> 00:56:18,290
companies.
He also sold current TV,

1308
00:56:18,300 --> 00:56:19,820
Al Jazeera,
which is owned by Cutera,

1309
00:56:19,830 --> 00:56:21,780
one of the biggest exporters of oil in 
the world.

1310
00:56:21,780 --> 00:56:24,730
But,
but that's not what we digress.

1311
00:56:24,731 --> 00:56:26,900
Let's not dwell on that.
Um,

1312
00:56:27,400 --> 00:56:28,360
okay,
let's,

1313
00:56:28,480 --> 00:56:29,313
let's move over to fake news because I,
this is so tied into what's happening 

1314
00:56:32,081 --> 00:56:32,914
with trump,
the outrage machine and then the fake 

1315
00:56:35,561 --> 00:56:36,910
news machine.
All of this,

1316
00:56:36,950 --> 00:56:41,800
you've been all over this.
I am just a pocket,

1317
00:56:41,820 --> 00:56:45,610
a pap apoplectic and apoplectic about 
what's going on with this.

1318
00:56:45,790 --> 00:56:47,530
Because I see the mainstream media 
crumbling.

1319
00:56:47,531 --> 00:56:48,364
I see online media growing,
but I see risks in that too because 

1320
00:56:50,621 --> 00:56:51,454
anybody can put on a tie and pretend 
they're somebody and get a desk and 

1321
00:56:54,221 --> 00:56:54,791
that's,
you know,

1322
00:56:54,791 --> 00:56:56,380
it is what it is.
Uh,

1323
00:56:56,440 --> 00:57:01,440
how bad is this scorge of fake news?
I think we've always had really bad fake

1324
00:57:02,171 --> 00:57:04,210
news.
It just got passed off as CBS,

1325
00:57:04,211 --> 00:57:06,340
NBC or ABC.
Um,

1326
00:57:06,660 --> 00:57:07,493
uh,
there've been lots of stories in my 

1327
00:57:08,381 --> 00:57:09,360
opinion that had been fake news.

1328
00:57:09,360 --> 00:57:10,690
Stories are,
one of them was,

1329
00:57:10,691 --> 00:57:11,530
um,
uh,

1330
00:57:11,531 --> 00:57:14,650
when Obama was pushing obamacare,
he said over and over again,

1331
00:57:14,900 --> 00:57:15,733
uh,
that his mother who was suffering from 

1332
00:57:16,691 --> 00:57:19,210
cancer as she lay dying in her hospital 
bed in Hawaii,

1333
00:57:19,450 --> 00:57:20,283
had to fight with her insurance carrier 
to pay for her medical bills and her 

1334
00:57:22,301 --> 00:57:24,520
hospital bills.
Turns out it is not true.

1335
00:57:24,760 --> 00:57:25,593
He said it over and over and over again.
A book came out by a woman named Janice 

1336
00:57:28,640 --> 00:57:29,381
Scott,
who used to work with the New York 

1337
00:57:29,381 --> 00:57:30,790
Times.
Therefore it must be a good book.

1338
00:57:32,080 --> 00:57:34,210
And she said that those bills were 
promptly paid.

1339
00:57:34,360 --> 00:57:37,120
The only coral was that Obama's mom and 
dad had taken out a,

1340
00:57:37,121 --> 00:57:38,280
um,
uh,

1341
00:57:38,310 --> 00:57:39,960
a policy,
uh,

1342
00:57:40,270 --> 00:57:42,940
so that if she got sick,
she would be entitled to money.

1343
00:57:43,360 --> 00:57:46,370
And the,
the law is that if you are,

1344
00:57:46,371 --> 00:57:49,630
have been diagnosed you and you try to 
take our policy like that,

1345
00:57:49,940 --> 00:57:50,471
uh,
we can,

1346
00:57:50,471 --> 00:57:51,280
we can challenge it.

1347
00:57:51,280 --> 00:57:53,680
And that's what they challenged.
But regarding her medical bills,

1348
00:57:53,681 --> 00:57:55,240
hospital bills,
they were paid promptly,

1349
00:57:55,360 --> 00:57:57,490
but he said it over and over and over 
again.

1350
00:57:57,820 --> 00:58:01,090
And it helped to drive the narrative 
that if my more that got jacked over and

1351
00:58:01,091 --> 00:58:04,840
she has a phd and has a son from Harvard
with a law degree,

1352
00:58:04,960 --> 00:58:07,030
imagine what these insurance carriers 
will do to you.

1353
00:58:07,150 --> 00:58:09,160
It turns out complete completely not 
true.

1354
00:58:10,030 --> 00:58:11,350
Another fake news.
Oh,

1355
00:58:11,440 --> 00:58:12,273
I said,
I think I said earlier when Obama said 

1356
00:58:13,691 --> 00:58:14,524
during his many pref press conferences,
I am most proud of the fact that I 

1357
00:58:17,711 --> 00:58:22,180
rescue the economy.
Really tarp was done by George W.

1358
00:58:22,180 --> 00:58:24,100
Bush.
The bailouts were done by George W.

1359
00:58:24,100 --> 00:58:24,551
Bush.
Uh,

1360
00:58:24,551 --> 00:58:26,350
and many of the things that Obama has 
done,

1361
00:58:26,351 --> 00:58:28,450
including stimulus,
actually hurt the recovery,

1362
00:58:28,451 --> 00:58:29,350
didn't help it,
it,

1363
00:58:29,351 --> 00:58:31,090
he says this over and over again with a 
straight face.

1364
00:58:31,180 --> 00:58:32,013
And the failure of the media not to ask 
challenging questions when he raises 

1365
00:58:34,211 --> 00:58:35,560
that to me is fake news.

1366
00:58:35,560 --> 00:58:38,050
So that's the issue.
So not to split hairs there,

1367
00:58:38,051 --> 00:58:40,960
but that's the issue that we've had 
basically a lapdog media.

1368
00:58:41,080 --> 00:58:41,913
So there's the idea,
I think when the left talks about fake 

1369
00:58:43,541 --> 00:58:44,374
news,
they're talking about these right wing 

1370
00:58:44,891 --> 00:58:46,780
sites that are just making up things,
right?

1371
00:58:46,930 --> 00:58:47,763
They push a lot of that on,
on Breitbart and we can talk about that 

1372
00:58:49,670 --> 00:58:50,503
you want,
but that's different than what you're 

1373
00:58:52,451 --> 00:58:53,980
talking about,
which is just immediate.

1374
00:58:53,981 --> 00:58:58,390
That just simply got cozy.
They got cozy with the people in power,

1375
00:58:58,391 --> 00:59:02,080
so they just stopped doing their job.
You're calling that fake news.

1376
00:59:02,320 --> 00:59:04,860
Absolutely.
These are two separate types of fake.

1377
00:59:04,930 --> 00:59:05,763
Absolutely.
I talked earlier about Obama pulling 

1378
00:59:07,451 --> 00:59:09,550
completely out of Iraq over the 
objection of his,

1379
00:59:09,551 --> 00:59:10,990
uh,
of his team.

1380
00:59:11,320 --> 00:59:13,090
He also then said,
well,

1381
00:59:13,091 --> 00:59:15,220
the reason I did that is because George 
W.

1382
00:59:15,220 --> 00:59:17,860
Bush had negotiated a,
an agreement that required me to leave.

1383
00:59:17,860 --> 00:59:20,350
At the time,
I did completely not true.

1384
00:59:20,351 --> 00:59:22,580
George W.
Bush negotiated an agreement,

1385
00:59:22,581 --> 00:59:26,990
but he fully expected his successor to 
negotiate a stay behind force.

1386
00:59:27,140 --> 00:59:29,060
And again,
Obama has said this over and over again,

1387
00:59:29,090 --> 00:59:30,620
and the media hasn't said anything about
that.

1388
00:59:30,830 --> 00:59:32,270
That to me,
fake news.

1389
00:59:32,510 --> 00:59:33,343
Right.
So I remember when that happened and I 

1390
00:59:34,341 --> 00:59:36,680
remember thinking when Obama said it,
yes,

1391
00:59:36,681 --> 00:59:38,660
they had,
they had set the date,

1392
00:59:39,020 --> 00:59:42,110
but obviously Obama had plenty of 
political capitol at the time.

1393
00:59:42,200 --> 00:59:44,090
If he had wanted to stay,
he could've stayed.

1394
00:59:44,300 --> 00:59:46,520
So that's right.
This is just a,

1395
00:59:46,521 --> 00:59:47,354
it's just a conflation of poor media 
practices and we saw a lot of this with 

1396
00:59:51,231 --> 00:59:52,970
Hillary.
I just pour media practices,

1397
00:59:53,730 --> 00:59:55,080
the willpower,
the willingness to,

1398
00:59:55,520 --> 00:59:56,353
the willingness to,
the willingness to look the other way 

1399
00:59:57,261 --> 00:59:58,820
because it's a guy that you're pulling 
for.

1400
00:59:58,840 --> 01:00:00,680
Yeah.
When Obama came into office,

1401
01:00:00,681 --> 01:00:04,490
he reneged on a deal that George W.
Bush and negotiated.

1402
01:00:04,640 --> 01:00:05,473
He negotiated a deal with Poland and the
Czech Republic to for them to get 

1403
01:00:07,671 --> 01:00:09,590
missile defense.
Russia didn't like it.

1404
01:00:09,980 --> 01:00:13,610
Obama thought that he could curry favor 
with Russia by reneging on the deal.

1405
01:00:13,611 --> 01:00:15,200
And he did,
um,

1406
01:00:15,230 --> 01:00:16,063
the failure of the media to bring this 
up and to bring up him saying him and 

1407
01:00:18,741 --> 01:00:22,610
pushing the reset button and him saying 
to Medvedev,

1408
01:00:22,880 --> 01:00:24,560
ah,
when I get reelected I have more,

1409
01:00:24,590 --> 01:00:25,423
I'll have more flexibility.
The failure of the media to bring this 

1410
01:00:27,621 --> 01:00:28,454
up when they're hitting Donald Trump for
being too cozy with Putin is another 

1411
01:00:31,191 --> 01:00:32,024
example of fake news.
So that to me is the monster that we've 

1412
01:00:35,601 --> 01:00:38,510
created.
They did nothing for so long now because

1413
01:00:38,511 --> 01:00:41,330
they don't like trump.
They're trying to be professionals,

1414
01:00:41,810 --> 01:00:42,643
which I want them to write.
I want them to do true investigative 

1415
01:00:45,171 --> 01:00:47,300
journalism.
I want them to fight the power.

1416
01:00:47,510 --> 01:00:48,343
But they seem almost ridiculous doing it
now because they're watching tweets and 

1417
01:00:51,501 --> 01:00:52,900
getting outraged before weekend.

1418
01:00:52,930 --> 01:00:53,763
Right.
I just wrote a column about all of this 

1419
01:00:54,800 --> 01:00:55,633
and what I've said is that the media has
rediscovered their mission now that the 

1420
01:00:57,951 --> 01:01:00,530
Republicans back in the White House.
But before that,

1421
01:01:00,620 --> 01:01:02,000
in my opinion,
they didn't do their jobs.

1422
01:01:02,030 --> 01:01:02,920
Yeah.
Easy.

1423
01:01:02,940 --> 01:01:04,360
Almost too late for them.
Have they?

1424
01:01:04,380 --> 01:01:05,213
Because I think they've lost so much 
credit that even now is they scurry to 

1425
01:01:08,871 --> 01:01:10,670
get their credit back.
I mean,

1426
01:01:10,671 --> 01:01:11,630
for example,
uh,

1427
01:01:11,631 --> 01:01:15,500
yesterday,
the day before I watched the second Sean

1428
01:01:15,500 --> 01:01:16,040
Spicer,
uh,

1429
01:01:16,040 --> 01:01:16,851
press conference,
not,

1430
01:01:16,851 --> 01:01:19,350
not the quick one where he was bickering
about the first official.

1431
01:01:19,400 --> 01:01:20,810
I watched the first official one,
right?

1432
01:01:20,811 --> 01:01:23,480
I think it was Monday and I watched the 
entire thing.

1433
01:01:23,481 --> 01:01:25,760
I'm doing cardio or that's the only way 
I can watch it.

1434
01:01:25,761 --> 01:01:27,230
Right.
I got to buy up to be moving.

1435
01:01:27,740 --> 01:01:29,600
You got to run from the bullshit.
So I'm watching this thing.

1436
01:01:29,601 --> 01:01:30,434
Okay.
I thought he basically did a pretty 

1437
01:01:32,511 --> 01:01:33,080
decent job.

1438
01:01:33,080 --> 01:01:36,980
He took a good Julian questions.
He answered them in pretty much the same

1439
01:01:36,981 --> 01:01:39,050
way that all prices people do,
which is,

1440
01:01:39,200 --> 01:01:40,033
you know,
half answers and partially that's what 

1441
01:01:42,261 --> 01:01:44,450
they do.
But suddenly I saw the headlines.

1442
01:01:44,570 --> 01:01:45,403
First of off the,
the main twitter moment headline was 

1443
01:01:46,791 --> 01:01:49,670
saying that he was focusing on the 
numbers of people there.

1444
01:01:49,880 --> 01:01:50,713
That was just a small portion and it was
only because they kept asking him that 

1445
01:01:53,601 --> 01:01:54,470
same question.
Right?

1446
01:01:54,710 --> 01:01:56,660
So that's also fake news,
right?

1447
01:01:56,661 --> 01:01:59,540
Where they just keep framing something a
certain way,

1448
01:01:59,570 --> 01:02:01,670
not just the,
not just what it said,

1449
01:02:01,910 --> 01:02:05,540
but that you can take an hour and a half
thing and go,

1450
01:02:05,780 --> 01:02:06,613
well,
this was the part that was important 

1451
01:02:07,850 --> 01:02:08,331
when,
you know,

1452
01:02:08,331 --> 01:02:11,000
it actually wasn't the part that,
let me say a couple of things about that

1453
01:02:11,540 --> 01:02:12,373
spicer and not only quarreled with the 
idea that trump's a audience was larger 

1454
01:02:16,521 --> 01:02:17,640
than what the media report it.

1455
01:02:18,110 --> 01:02:18,943
Uh,
he also talked about the fact that a 

1456
01:02:21,091 --> 01:02:22,650
reporter from Time magazine,
not,

1457
01:02:22,680 --> 01:02:27,680
not the Bug Tussle Gazette Time magazine
said that I'm a Donald Trump removed the

1458
01:02:27,931 --> 01:02:32,580
bus to vml k from the Oval Office.
Now that to me is a major story.

1459
01:02:32,640 --> 01:02:34,710
If it were true,
it is not true.

1460
01:02:34,950 --> 01:02:36,580
Time magazine,
uh,

1461
01:02:37,350 --> 01:02:38,183
reported for twice Time magazine tweeted
it and it went around the world rather 

1462
01:02:41,911 --> 01:02:42,744
than focus on that fake news part,
they talk about what Sean Spicer said 

1463
01:02:46,201 --> 01:02:47,034
about the crowd size because that's 
something they could probably make an 

1464
01:02:49,561 --> 01:02:51,420
argument about.
What the mlk thing,

1465
01:02:51,421 --> 01:02:52,254
they can't make an argument about it.
So when we haven't even talked about 

1466
01:02:53,971 --> 01:02:56,770
that and we found out because of Wiki 
leaks.

1467
01:02:56,820 --> 01:02:59,460
David,
how many of these reporters,

1468
01:02:59,730 --> 01:03:02,460
we're in bed with the DNC in bed with 
Hillary,

1469
01:03:02,880 --> 01:03:05,400
I mean in New York Times reporter is 
doing a massive story on,

1470
01:03:05,460 --> 01:03:09,090
on Hillary and and gave her veto proof 
over quotes.

1471
01:03:09,090 --> 01:03:09,923
She doesn't like a power that she,
that she in fact use and took out a 

1472
01:03:13,381 --> 01:03:15,090
quote that she had made about Sarah 
Pailin.

1473
01:03:15,180 --> 01:03:16,013
Yeah.
You're not making this up by the night 

1474
01:03:16,880 --> 01:03:18,180
wash it.
Washington Post,

1475
01:03:18,350 --> 01:03:19,183
uh,
was doing a story on John Podesta and 

1476
01:03:20,521 --> 01:03:21,354
found out some conflict of interest 
regarding money and gave him a heads up 

1477
01:03:24,601 --> 01:03:25,590
and told him,
don't worry about it.

1478
01:03:25,591 --> 01:03:26,520
We'll bury it in the,
in the,

1479
01:03:26,521 --> 01:03:31,320
in the story a staffer is far for jake 
tapper in for Wolf Blitzer of CNN,

1480
01:03:31,530 --> 01:03:32,363
contacted the DNC and said,
we're about ready to interview some 

1481
01:03:33,961 --> 01:03:35,460
Republicans.
You have any questions for us?

1482
01:03:35,700 --> 01:03:38,370
Dana Milbank is a columnist with the 
Washington Post.

1483
01:03:38,700 --> 01:03:39,533
He did a story,
a column called the 10 most outrageous 

1484
01:03:41,341 --> 01:03:45,480
things Donald Trump has ever said.
He contacted the DNC and said,

1485
01:03:45,540 --> 01:03:46,373
I'm about ready to do this column on the
10 most outrageous things Donald Trump 

1486
01:03:48,691 --> 01:03:49,290
ever said.

1487
01:03:49,290 --> 01:03:51,150
Do you have any suggestions?
They gave him 10 suggestions.

1488
01:03:51,151 --> 01:03:52,250
He used eight.
Yeah.

1489
01:03:52,350 --> 01:03:53,183
Are you kidding me?
You didn't even mention the most 

1490
01:03:54,181 --> 01:03:56,730
egregious one in my opinion,
which is the whole Donna Brazil thing,

1491
01:03:56,731 --> 01:03:57,564
which is to me the heart,
because that one is the heart of how 

1492
01:04:00,631 --> 01:04:03,570
corrupt media and politicians have 
become.

1493
01:04:03,600 --> 01:04:08,600
But at least cnn fired her.
But the d DNC hired her as interim chair

1494
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:09,833
even after she was out in his head as 
having conspired with hilary to make 

1495
01:04:13,141 --> 01:04:14,780
sure that Bernie Sanders,
uh,

1496
01:04:14,810 --> 01:04:15,300
got,
uh,

1497
01:04:15,300 --> 01:04:16,081
didn't,
did not win.

1498
01:04:16,081 --> 01:04:18,990
So what is at the moment,
but I think the most are one of the most

1499
01:04:18,991 --> 01:04:20,310
outrageous ones is,
um,

1500
01:04:20,580 --> 01:04:22,410
a guy named Kurt.
I can wald.

1501
01:04:22,490 --> 01:04:23,323
Yeah.
He writes for Newsweek and tweeted that 

1502
01:04:25,921 --> 01:04:29,610
Donald Trump had been put in a mental 
institution for some time,

1503
01:04:30,210 --> 01:04:31,043
no evidence for it whatsoever.
He took the tweet down pretty quickly 

1504
01:04:33,781 --> 01:04:37,650
when it was debunked but he wasn't fired
or or even suspend or even chastise.

1505
01:04:38,370 --> 01:04:40,770
So this is where people talk about post 
truth.

1506
01:04:41,520 --> 01:04:44,390
Now I know we don't want to be in a post
truth society what's post true,

1507
01:04:44,450 --> 01:04:45,283
but we'll post truth that at this point,
you know any idiot who's amass the 

1508
01:04:49,330 --> 01:04:50,850
150,000
twitter followers,

1509
01:04:50,851 --> 01:04:51,684
it has as much influence in a lot of 
respects as news one on one was that 

1510
01:04:54,931 --> 01:04:57,500
150,000
acre?

1511
01:04:57,840 --> 01:04:59,790
Thank you for calling me an idiot.
I just went above it.

1512
01:04:59,791 --> 01:05:00,624
That's why I mentioned that number cause
I was any idiot that could have as much 

1513
01:05:02,851 --> 01:05:04,860
influence but,
but really you could have a set,

1514
01:05:04,861 --> 01:05:08,070
you could figure out how to do the 
social media game and somehow because of

1515
01:05:08,071 --> 01:05:10,230
that you've got a little blue check to 
now.

1516
01:05:10,410 --> 01:05:11,243
Now you're an authority on this stuff 
and there so that I do see as a major 

1517
01:05:14,251 --> 01:05:18,850
risk that while I wanted the mainstream 
media to get the lashing,

1518
01:05:18,851 --> 01:05:19,684
it deserved the fact that it's now 
everyone's just picking their truth 

1519
01:05:23,681 --> 01:05:24,610
wherever they can find it.

1520
01:05:24,610 --> 01:05:26,380
As a huge problem.
It's,

1521
01:05:26,460 --> 01:05:29,770
it's both a problem and a blessing.
It also means that the,

1522
01:05:29,771 --> 01:05:30,341
uh,
the,

1523
01:05:30,341 --> 01:05:32,380
the traditional establishment media,
it can be,

1524
01:05:32,410 --> 01:05:34,420
can be gone around.
Uh,

1525
01:05:34,421 --> 01:05:36,130
you can get your ideas out,
uh,

1526
01:05:36,150 --> 01:05:36,983
and uh,
and nothing can stop you from 

1527
01:05:38,801 --> 01:05:40,420
communicating to people.
Uh,

1528
01:05:40,480 --> 01:05:41,313
but you're right.
It means that anybody can communicate 

1529
01:05:43,151 --> 01:05:44,800
and whether or not he or she is 
credible,

1530
01:05:45,100 --> 01:05:45,933
uh,
is left to you as a consumer to figure 

1531
01:05:47,981 --> 01:05:48,814
out.
Is there any way that you think trump 

1532
01:05:50,111 --> 01:05:52,240
can reconcile this relationship with the
media?

1533
01:05:52,270 --> 01:05:54,760
Because I think it's almost the most 
important thing right now.

1534
01:05:54,761 --> 01:05:55,594
More important than the policies because
it's one thing to just rail against the 

1535
01:05:58,181 --> 01:05:59,380
media all the time.
Again,

1536
01:05:59,560 --> 01:06:01,810
I don't like what the media,
the mainstream media has done,

1537
01:06:02,110 --> 01:06:02,943
but do you think you can get to a point 
where he'll actually do some real sit 

1538
01:06:05,641 --> 01:06:06,474
downs,
do some real press conferences and not 

1539
01:06:08,621 --> 01:06:09,850
do the same things,
you know,

1540
01:06:09,851 --> 01:06:11,690
be willing to sit down with an 
interviewer.

1541
01:06:11,710 --> 01:06:12,543
Hopefully it will be me,
but maybe it will be somebody else and 

1542
01:06:13,871 --> 01:06:15,820
not demand the questions in advance,
you know,

1543
01:06:15,821 --> 01:06:19,150
be better than all the reasons that you 
just said the Democrats.

1544
01:06:19,330 --> 01:06:22,720
Well,
I don't think it donald trump's job to,

1545
01:06:22,721 --> 01:06:24,700
uh,
to curry favor with the media.

1546
01:06:24,910 --> 01:06:27,790
I think it's the media's job to be fair.
Um,

1547
01:06:27,850 --> 01:06:32,850
and as far as I'm concerned,
he has very little risk.

1548
01:06:35,290 --> 01:06:39,010
Um,
he is disliked more than Reagan,

1549
01:06:39,190 --> 01:06:40,600
more than George W.
Bush.

1550
01:06:40,990 --> 01:06:42,310
Uh,
in my opinion,

1551
01:06:42,730 --> 01:06:43,930
uh,
they're out to get him.

1552
01:06:44,170 --> 01:06:45,003
And for him to have a more 
confrontational attitude towards the 

1553
01:06:47,141 --> 01:06:47,974
media to me,
makes perfect sense because there is no 

1554
01:06:51,520 --> 01:06:52,353
upside in him doing it any other way.
They're going to go after him like 

1555
01:06:54,761 --> 01:06:56,110
nobody's business.
They just,

1556
01:06:56,140 --> 01:06:58,240
they just like him because of his 
attitude about,

1557
01:06:58,241 --> 01:06:58,830
uh,
about,

1558
01:06:58,830 --> 01:06:59,561
uh,
uh,

1559
01:06:59,561 --> 01:07:01,270
immigration.
Uh,

1560
01:07:01,390 --> 01:07:02,620
they think of him as a racist.

1561
01:07:03,530 --> 01:07:04,720
You think of him as a,
as a,

1562
01:07:04,721 --> 01:07:05,501
as a bigot,
as a,

1563
01:07:05,501 --> 01:07:06,334
as a tyrant.
If that's your attitude and you're not 

1564
01:07:09,161 --> 01:07:11,680
going to cut me any slack,
why should I kiss your butt?

1565
01:07:12,040 --> 01:07:14,290
And so I have no problem with what Sean 
did.

1566
01:07:15,040 --> 01:07:16,360
Sean Spicer,
his first,

1567
01:07:16,640 --> 01:07:18,340
uh,
informal press conference when he,

1568
01:07:18,341 --> 01:07:19,840
when he blasted the media the way he 
did.

1569
01:07:20,320 --> 01:07:23,020
And it does turn out that Donald Trump's
audience,

1570
01:07:23,021 --> 01:07:24,710
which is the word he used,
uh,

1571
01:07:24,711 --> 01:07:27,310
to watch the inaugural with,
was bigger than any audience and history

1572
01:07:27,311 --> 01:07:29,110
in part because of social media.
Right?

1573
01:07:29,111 --> 01:07:31,360
So a lot of people on twitter were angry
me over that,

1574
01:07:31,361 --> 01:07:32,194
cause I didn't say anything about it.
But if you listen to actually what he 

1575
01:07:35,081 --> 01:07:35,770
said,
he said,

1576
01:07:35,770 --> 01:07:36,800
audience,
meaning he,

1577
01:07:36,910 --> 01:07:38,890
and then he clarified it on Monday.
He said,

1578
01:07:38,891 --> 01:07:40,720
I mean,
people that are streaming it on facebook

1579
01:07:40,721 --> 01:07:42,570
and watching on ipads and youtube and 
all that,

1580
01:07:43,090 --> 01:07:45,550
but everybody wants everyone to get 
outraged all the time.

1581
01:07:45,550 --> 01:07:46,530
It's exhausting,
isn't it?

1582
01:07:46,540 --> 01:07:48,520
It also turns out,
apparently,

1583
01:07:48,521 --> 01:07:50,170
that when you look at the,
the,

1584
01:07:50,200 --> 01:07:50,860
the,
uh,

1585
01:07:50,860 --> 01:07:52,330
the pictures of,
of,

1586
01:07:52,331 --> 01:07:54,940
uh,
Obama's inaugural and trump's,

1587
01:07:55,090 --> 01:07:55,923
trump's does look thinner,
but my understanding is part of that is 

1588
01:07:58,151 --> 01:08:00,850
because of security measures.
There are certain places you can't stand

1589
01:08:00,851 --> 01:08:03,160
anymore for in place.
You can't go through anymore.

1590
01:08:03,220 --> 01:08:04,053
It's a lot of people couldn't get to the
main area because of all these security 

1591
01:08:06,521 --> 01:08:07,960
requirements.
So you're comparing,

1592
01:08:08,120 --> 01:08:08,953
uh,
not apples to apples and so you'd agree 

1593
01:08:10,990 --> 01:08:13,090
all of that is just sideshow nonsense,
right?

1594
01:08:13,091 --> 01:08:14,960
Like it's actually completely 
irrelevant.

1595
01:08:16,340 --> 01:08:17,720
The amount of people I'm talking about,
not,

1596
01:08:17,721 --> 01:08:18,554
not the lying about it,
but just whether they were x amount of 

1597
01:08:20,451 --> 01:08:24,440
people or why it's completely irrelevant
except that he's putting media on notice

1598
01:08:24,441 --> 01:08:25,880
that you have to be fair to me.
Yeah.

1599
01:08:26,210 --> 01:08:28,140
Do you think the media regrets,
you know,

1600
01:08:28,190 --> 01:08:29,023
it's hard to categorize all the media,
but when they look back at the way they 

1601
01:08:31,281 --> 01:08:34,040
treated mccain,
who now looks like the most moderate,

1602
01:08:34,430 --> 01:08:36,110
the public and of all time,
you know,

1603
01:08:36,200 --> 01:08:37,033
and they,
they,

1604
01:08:37,070 --> 01:08:38,660
they were times calling him racist.

1605
01:08:38,660 --> 01:08:40,790
And I think he has an adopted black 
daughter,

1606
01:08:40,791 --> 01:08:41,624
if I'm not mistaken.
Or when they look at Romney and the 

1607
01:08:43,941 --> 01:08:46,130
binders of women and made it sound like 
he hates women,

1608
01:08:46,340 --> 01:08:47,600
that they,
in a way,

1609
01:08:47,601 --> 01:08:52,430
they created trump because any 
republican was going to get the cries of

1610
01:08:52,431 --> 01:08:53,264
racism,
was going to get the cries of misogyny 

1611
01:08:54,651 --> 01:08:56,900
and the crisis xenophobia and homophobia
and all that.

1612
01:08:56,920 --> 01:08:58,290
Right?
So he brings up Peter Teal.

1613
01:08:58,291 --> 01:09:00,820
These still hates gays.
He has a,

1614
01:09:00,890 --> 01:09:02,120
uh,
Ben Carson,

1615
01:09:02,121 --> 01:09:03,620
he's still lays black.
So in a way,

1616
01:09:03,621 --> 01:09:06,920
he was the only answer to this absurd 
equation,

1617
01:09:06,980 --> 01:09:08,480
right?
I think you're right.

1618
01:09:08,481 --> 01:09:10,820
I think the media did they help to 
create Donald Trump.

1619
01:09:11,360 --> 01:09:15,770
People resent the idea that the media 
has gone after Republicans in a way that

1620
01:09:15,771 --> 01:09:19,100
they not gone after Democrats.
And so there's a distrust.

1621
01:09:19,280 --> 01:09:20,113
And when Donald Trump talked about 
political correctness and how he was no 

1622
01:09:22,971 --> 01:09:26,120
longer going to be politically correct,
a lot of people took that to mean I'm no

1623
01:09:26,121 --> 01:09:30,290
longer going to going to thinking of 
myself as a racist,

1624
01:09:30,510 --> 01:09:33,560
as a sexist,
simply because I've got normal views and

1625
01:09:33,561 --> 01:09:35,630
normal ideas at any other guy has.

1626
01:09:35,930 --> 01:09:39,150
And I think Donald Trump has given 
people like that a certain amount of,

1627
01:09:39,151 --> 01:09:40,640
uh,
of comfort and credibility.

1628
01:09:40,730 --> 01:09:41,570
Yeah.
All right.

1629
01:09:41,571 --> 01:09:42,404
So one more for Ya,
which we'll sort of wrap this whole 

1630
01:09:43,881 --> 01:09:46,100
thing up.
What happens over the next four years?

1631
01:09:46,101 --> 01:09:50,450
Where do you really see this all going?
Do you see this endless clash between,

1632
01:09:50,480 --> 01:09:51,313
between trump and the left?
Is there a way to get the media 

1633
01:09:53,390 --> 01:09:54,223
straightened out?
Can we get some of this societal stuff 

1634
01:09:56,860 --> 01:09:57,693
to,
to shake out or is it just going to be 

1635
01:09:58,941 --> 01:10:02,030
more battling because it seems,
I thought there was going to be a couple

1636
01:10:02,030 --> 01:10:03,710
of days after the election where 
everyone would take a breath.

1637
01:10:03,850 --> 01:10:05,930
Right?
It seems like everyone's just ramping up

1638
01:10:05,931 --> 01:10:06,880
more and more now.
No,

1639
01:10:06,890 --> 01:10:09,110
people see things differently.
We disagree.

1640
01:10:09,111 --> 01:10:11,420
We disagree about abortion.
We disagree about same sex marriage.

1641
01:10:11,421 --> 01:10:12,950
We disagree about taxes,
about spending,

1642
01:10:12,951 --> 01:10:14,000
about foreign policy.

1643
01:10:14,300 --> 01:10:15,133
As long as we have those disagreements,
we're going to have these kinds of 

1644
01:10:16,491 --> 01:10:18,680
disputes.
But I think what will happen,

1645
01:10:18,970 --> 01:10:19,820
uh,
hopefully,

1646
01:10:20,030 --> 01:10:22,370
uh,
is that we have 4% GDP growth.

1647
01:10:22,620 --> 01:10:24,050
Uh,
like we did under Ronald Reagan.

1648
01:10:24,051 --> 01:10:25,730
Ronald Reagan was overwhelmingly 
reelected,

1649
01:10:25,970 --> 01:10:26,803
not because people agreed with him,
they disagreed with him about his 

1650
01:10:28,941 --> 01:10:31,370
nuclear proliferation.
They disagreed about,

1651
01:10:31,420 --> 01:10:32,181
uh,
his,

1652
01:10:32,181 --> 01:10:33,014
um,
uh,

1653
01:10:33,040 --> 01:10:33,873
going into South America and trying to 
roll back some of the communists 

1654
01:10:36,540 --> 01:10:38,750
movements there.
If you go down and list by list,

1655
01:10:38,751 --> 01:10:39,584
it was a article in the New York Times 
in 1986 I talked about all of these 

1656
01:10:43,131 --> 01:10:45,830
points of views and how Americans 
disagreed with Ronald Reagan,

1657
01:10:45,920 --> 01:10:46,753
but they respected him and 
overwhelmingly reelected him because 

1658
01:10:49,760 --> 01:10:54,740
ultimately it comes down to the economy 
comes down to pocket book and 70% of the

1659
01:10:54,741 --> 01:10:57,320
American people felt that we were on the
wrong track economically.

1660
01:10:57,620 --> 01:10:58,453
Uh,
and that is the primary reason in my 

1661
01:10:59,721 --> 01:11:00,554
view,
why Donald Trump won worst economic 

1662
01:11:02,031 --> 01:11:03,410
recovery since 1949.

1663
01:11:03,710 --> 01:11:06,890
This has been a 2% recovery.
The average recovery 3%.

1664
01:11:07,190 --> 01:11:08,023
And the difference between 2% and 3% is 
1 million jobs times at length the 

1665
01:11:10,701 --> 01:11:11,534
recovery.
So if Obama had done nothing had on is 

1666
01:11:13,471 --> 01:11:15,630
putting,
we have 7 million more jobs than we have

1667
01:11:15,631 --> 01:11:16,440
right now.
Yeah.

1668
01:11:16,440 --> 01:11:17,273
Well,
he did work on the buddy know we'd have 

1669
01:11:18,240 --> 01:11:18,870
10 million.
Morgan.

1670
01:11:18,870 --> 01:11:20,370
Good.
All right.

1671
01:11:20,371 --> 01:11:21,570
Well,
Larry was a pleasure.

1672
01:11:21,571 --> 01:11:25,710
We're going to do a little boat to 
segment for our audience and I thank you

1673
01:11:25,711 --> 01:11:26,544
for coming back.
Pleasure and we're going to link to the 

1674
01:11:27,511 --> 01:11:30,870
original one and people can see if maybe
I changed you in some ways too.

1675
01:11:30,871 --> 01:11:34,110
Who knows?
Well,

1676
01:11:34,111 --> 01:11:36,960
I felt I felt the same way leaving as I 
felt coming.

1677
01:11:37,590 --> 01:11:38,640
How's that?
Fair enough.

1678
01:11:38,641 --> 01:11:41,280
All for war on Larry.
