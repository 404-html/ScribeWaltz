1
00:00:02,670 --> 00:00:03,510
Alright,
so as you guys know,

2
00:00:03,511 --> 00:00:04,344
I've spent a lot of time on the Rubin 
report talking about the current status 

3
00:00:06,541 --> 00:00:08,640
of the left.
As I've said many times,

4
00:00:08,850 --> 00:00:09,683
I believe the regressive left the group 
of people who use illiberal tactics to 

5
00:00:13,651 --> 00:00:14,484
silence those defending liberal 
principles to be the left's version of 

6
00:00:17,461 --> 00:00:19,980
the tea party.
If we don't reign them in now,

7
00:00:19,981 --> 00:00:20,814
then the left in America will end up as 
fractured as the right evidence of the 

8
00:00:24,361 --> 00:00:28,380
fractured right is everywhere with 
basically every mainstream conservative,

9
00:00:28,410 --> 00:00:31,170
actively trying to stop the parties.
Front runner,

10
00:00:31,410 --> 00:00:32,243
Donald Trump.
Has there ever been a time when a front 

11
00:00:34,531 --> 00:00:38,610
runner on either side was so hated by 
his own party's establishment?

12
00:00:38,730 --> 00:00:41,070
Not that I know of,
and interestingly,

13
00:00:41,071 --> 00:00:43,920
this mess is actually of the gops own 
doing.

14
00:00:43,950 --> 00:00:46,860
They didn't see the rise of the tea 
party until it was too late,

15
00:00:47,130 --> 00:00:50,640
which set the gop establishment against 
their own base.

16
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:51,713
Ironically,
had the tea partiers been willing to 

17
00:00:53,011 --> 00:00:56,790
negotiate with anyone.
Perhaps the Republican party would be in

18
00:00:56,791 --> 00:01:00,420
a better state than the ideological mess
it's in right now.

19
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:01,553
That didn't happen though,
and when you couple of fractured right 

20
00:01:04,050 --> 00:01:04,883
with the rise of the regressive left,
who refused to talk honestly about 

21
00:01:07,831 --> 00:01:10,440
issues like Islamic extremism and 
immigration,

22
00:01:10,710 --> 00:01:14,160
we now have the rise of Donald trump.
Before I continue,

23
00:01:14,161 --> 00:01:16,830
let me say a couple of positive things 
about Donald Trump.

24
00:01:16,831 --> 00:01:18,330
Believe it or not,
uh,

25
00:01:18,331 --> 00:01:20,130
I probably should have issued a trigger 
warning there.

26
00:01:20,131 --> 00:01:20,964
But,
uh,

27
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:22,410
getting your safe space.
Here we go.

28
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:23,873
All right.
He has absolutely exposed our robotic 

29
00:01:26,461 --> 00:01:27,294
politicians who are bought and sold by 
campaign contributors openly Mocking 

30
00:01:31,980 --> 00:01:32,813
Hillary Clinton for showing up to his 
wedding because he gave her a donation 

31
00:01:35,610 --> 00:01:38,430
in many ways.
His message of a broken system corrupted

32
00:01:38,431 --> 00:01:42,300
by money is exactly the same thing that 
Bernie Sanders is saying.

33
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:43,553
Trump has also talked about America's 
awful trade deals with China and Mexico 

34
00:01:46,890 --> 00:01:47,723
and promise to negotiate better ones.
And actually there's every reason to 

35
00:01:50,791 --> 00:01:53,040
believe that he would be good at this 
after all,

36
00:01:53,041 --> 00:01:55,830
making deals is what he has built his 
empire on.

37
00:01:56,400 --> 00:02:00,990
People actually attack trump for having 
his trump brand ties made in Mexico.

38
00:02:01,230 --> 00:02:04,710
But that actually proves his point about
our bad trade deals.

39
00:02:04,860 --> 00:02:09,240
He's making things to sell where cost is
cheap and profit will be maximum.

40
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:10,433
As an American businessman,
he's doing what's best for his business 

41
00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:13,973
by making ties in Mexico.
It's not the fault of the businessman 

42
00:02:16,081 --> 00:02:16,914
who uses the system.
That's the fault of the politicians who 

43
00:02:19,171 --> 00:02:20,004
set up the bad deals which enable it.
Trump has also brought the issue of 

44
00:02:23,191 --> 00:02:25,410
immigration to the front and center of 
the debate.

45
00:02:25,411 --> 00:02:28,500
He says he'll build a wall and have 
Mexico pay for it.

46
00:02:28,530 --> 00:02:29,363
While I think that Mexico actually may 
end up building the wall and paying for 

47
00:02:31,741 --> 00:02:33,780
it to keep Americans out,
if he becomes president,

48
00:02:34,170 --> 00:02:37,020
he makes a serious populous point with 
the wall.

49
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:39,960
Trump always says,
we either have a country or we don't.

50
00:02:40,340 --> 00:02:41,173
A wall in and of itself isn't racist.
It may not be wise and it may not 

51
00:02:44,491 --> 00:02:45,324
address the real problems,
but when he talks in simple language 

52
00:02:47,941 --> 00:02:50,160
like that,
he scores points with many voters.

53
00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:53,010
Having secure borders shouldn't be a 
partisan issue,

54
00:02:53,250 --> 00:02:55,290
but because of our politically correct 
climate,

55
00:02:55,291 --> 00:02:56,124
it's become one.
You can be for better border security 

56
00:02:58,591 --> 00:02:59,424
and still not be a big.
That shouldn't be too hard to 

57
00:03:01,121 --> 00:03:02,650
understand.
Finally,

58
00:03:02,651 --> 00:03:03,484
he is also scored points with many 
people and talking about the spread of 

59
00:03:05,891 --> 00:03:09,310
Islamic extremism.
While trump never takes the time to make

60
00:03:09,311 --> 00:03:13,690
the distinction between Islamic 
extremism and the average Muslim person,

61
00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:14,733
he scores points by even talking about 
Islamic extremism in the first place 

62
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:21,280
because the left in this country refuses
to do so.

63
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:26,230
This failure on the left to tackle the 
topic of Islamic extremism,

64
00:03:26,231 --> 00:03:29,140
honestly,
by linking doctrine with action,

65
00:03:29,350 --> 00:03:34,300
actually helps feed those like trump who
come in with easy answers with no nuance

66
00:03:34,301 --> 00:03:37,870
or real understanding.
Trump sees an opening for an easy answer

67
00:03:37,871 --> 00:03:38,704
here,
like banning all Muslims from entry to 

68
00:03:39,821 --> 00:03:40,654
the country and he runs with it.
Turn on any cable news channel to see 

69
00:03:43,931 --> 00:03:45,940
the list of bad things about Donald 
Trump.

70
00:03:46,210 --> 00:03:47,043
We've heard them all before,
so I'm actually going to take a 

71
00:03:48,131 --> 00:03:51,580
different road here.
Let's talk about what the real threat of

72
00:03:51,581 --> 00:03:52,414
a Donald Trump presidency is.
Donald trump is a businessman making 

73
00:03:55,361 --> 00:03:58,630
business decisions,
but he's also a reality TV host.

74
00:03:58,631 --> 00:04:03,520
Winning the world's biggest reality TV 
show over the course of his presidential

75
00:04:03,521 --> 00:04:05,890
campaign.
Trump has made it clear that he will say

76
00:04:05,950 --> 00:04:09,160
anything,
literally anything just to be elected.

77
00:04:09,460 --> 00:04:13,240
He uses the media is need for clicks and
views to fuel his rise,

78
00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:14,440
knowing full well.

79
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:17,920
The more outlandish his statements are 
and the more clownish he acts,

80
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:23,160
the more free tv time he's going to get.
He has mastered the age old adage.

81
00:04:23,231 --> 00:04:24,064
Any publicity is good publicity.
People like trump for his lack of 

82
00:04:27,731 --> 00:04:28,564
political correctness,
but it's not what he says that they're 

83
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:31,713
responding to.
It's just that he's saying nothing and 

84
00:04:34,091 --> 00:04:37,810
everything at the same time without 
sounding like a career politician.

85
00:04:38,050 --> 00:04:41,050
Is He really against gay marriage now,
even though he used to be for it,

86
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:44,470
is he really against abortion now,
even though he used to be pro choice,

87
00:04:44,710 --> 00:04:48,520
I have no idea what's in his heart,
but I do know what's in his head.

88
00:04:48,550 --> 00:04:52,660
He wants to be the contestant who 
doesn't get fired on the season finale.

89
00:04:53,260 --> 00:04:54,093
Many people in this country want to feel
like America is winning again and trump 

90
00:04:56,891 --> 00:05:00,100
has wisely use this notion to fuel his 
campaign,

91
00:05:00,370 --> 00:05:04,360
but the question is,
what does electing trump actually mean?

92
00:05:04,750 --> 00:05:05,583
If he wins,
does anyone think he'll actually adhere 

93
00:05:07,451 --> 00:05:08,284
to the constitution?
Will he care about due process or 

94
00:05:10,721 --> 00:05:12,610
respect the three branches of 
government?

95
00:05:12,820 --> 00:05:13,653
Will he sue reporters who investigate 
the White House where we get into a war 

96
00:05:17,201 --> 00:05:20,980
over a mistaken,
retweet his gruff language and loose use

97
00:05:20,981 --> 00:05:21,814
of facts or only the micro problem here 
at the macro problem is that nobody 

98
00:05:25,301 --> 00:05:28,210
really knows what this guy stands for 
other than winning,

99
00:05:28,510 --> 00:05:30,970
and that's the real risk of a trump 
presidency.

100
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:31,833
We have no idea what the country will 
look like after we elect someone who 

101
00:05:35,351 --> 00:05:38,440
cares more about his own rules than the 
law of the land.

102
00:05:38,830 --> 00:05:39,431
You know,
he says,

103
00:05:39,431 --> 00:05:43,270
starbucks will put merry Christmas back 
on cups when he's president.

104
00:05:43,750 --> 00:05:44,583
Does he know that the president doesn't 
get to decide what a private company 

105
00:05:46,991 --> 00:05:49,540
does with their products as a business 
man?

106
00:05:49,541 --> 00:05:50,650
Yeah,
he does know,

107
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:51,513
but as a presidential candidate,
he doesn't care if winning at all costs 

108
00:05:55,001 --> 00:05:57,650
for a temporary feel good moment is good
for you,

109
00:05:57,651 --> 00:05:58,010
then by

110
00:05:58,010 --> 00:05:59,840
all means,
you should vote for Donald trump,

111
00:06:00,140 --> 00:06:00,973
but don't be fooled.
You're being sold a bill of goods by 

112
00:06:02,661 --> 00:06:06,080
someone who only cares about making the 
deal when the product sucks.

113
00:06:06,410 --> 00:06:07,243
Don't expect to get a refund.
My guest this week is the author of 

114
00:06:12,351 --> 00:06:14,210
gorilla mindset,
a lawyer,

115
00:06:14,211 --> 00:06:16,670
a twitter,
and a free speech activist.

116
00:06:16,940 --> 00:06:18,170
Mike Cernovich.
Welcome to the show.

117
00:06:18,260 --> 00:06:20,030
Thanks for having me on.
It's a,

118
00:06:20,031 --> 00:06:23,030
it's good to have you here.
We've done this in 140 characters.

119
00:06:23,031 --> 00:06:25,850
I say that to a lot of my guests,
but the whole nature of our relationship

120
00:06:25,851 --> 00:06:28,350
is 140 characters.
And uh,

121
00:06:28,670 --> 00:06:31,010
are you gonna be able to expand on 140?
I have.

122
00:06:31,011 --> 00:06:31,844
I have a podcast too.
I can run my mouth so it talks to each 

123
00:06:34,491 --> 00:06:35,210
other.
Alright,

124
00:06:35,210 --> 00:06:36,043
there you go.
So let's start off just so for the 

125
00:06:37,941 --> 00:06:41,180
people that don't know you,
tell me a little bit about your history,

126
00:06:41,181 --> 00:06:42,014
where you come from and uh,
and what got you to write the book and 

127
00:06:44,421 --> 00:06:45,680
then we'll,
we'll dive into that.

128
00:06:45,860 --> 00:06:46,491
Okay,
cool.

129
00:06:46,491 --> 00:06:50,020
So I'm a grew up small town kid,
flyover state,

130
00:06:50,030 --> 00:06:53,030
which everybody hates now because we're 
all redneck,

131
00:06:53,031 --> 00:06:54,740
backwoods,
hateful,

132
00:06:54,741 --> 00:06:56,520
bigoted people.
So I grateful I ever.

133
00:06:56,590 --> 00:06:57,980
It was that Illinois.
Okay,

134
00:06:58,100 --> 00:07:01,910
so I grew up in the middle of Illinois 
and nothing but corn fields and soy bean

135
00:07:01,911 --> 00:07:04,400
farms and I realized that I don't really
like this.

136
00:07:04,401 --> 00:07:06,050
I want to do something more with my 
life.

137
00:07:06,690 --> 00:07:09,540
Growing up I was also kind of a fat kid,
got bullied a lot,

138
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:13,160
got picked on.
Then I got into martial arts and started

139
00:07:13,190 --> 00:07:14,023
sort of beating up the people who 
bullied me and created that little 

140
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:18,350
conflict cycle.
Got that out of my.

141
00:07:18,460 --> 00:07:19,670
That's the bullied dream,
right?

142
00:07:19,790 --> 00:07:20,623
That's the.
I guess that's the bullied kid dream is 

143
00:07:23,031 --> 00:07:26,360
that you get bullied for awhile.
See some martial arts.

144
00:07:26,361 --> 00:07:27,470
You kick some ass.
Well I got.

145
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:30,770
I got back in everybody but one guy,
but he went to prison for it,

146
00:07:31,590 --> 00:07:32,423
so I was actually home when I was 22 and
I saw this guy went into the bathroom 

147
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:39,170
and I was going to go and just slam his 
head and my friend goes,

148
00:07:39,171 --> 00:07:40,230
what is wrong with you man?

149
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:40,940
You,
your.

150
00:07:40,940 --> 00:07:42,590
This happened when you were like 13 
years.

151
00:07:42,610 --> 00:07:43,460
Yeah,
22 now,

152
00:07:43,461 --> 00:07:44,450
you know.
I was like,

153
00:07:44,451 --> 00:07:45,220
yeah,
okay.

154
00:07:45,220 --> 00:07:46,880
Yeah.
Got Got that out of my system.

155
00:07:47,430 --> 00:07:48,263
It's funny because a lot of people do 
seem to repeat the things that happened 

156
00:07:51,911 --> 00:07:55,050
to them when you were 13,
like if you were bullied people,

157
00:07:55,070 --> 00:07:57,830
they then become the bullies adults.
Right,

158
00:07:57,860 --> 00:07:58,693
and that's probably why I hate bullies 
so much now it's just you realize these 

159
00:08:01,791 --> 00:08:06,470
people are trying to ruin lives and it's
as bad as bad vibe when you're a kid.

160
00:08:06,471 --> 00:08:09,140
Now I don't really like calling adults 
being bullied.

161
00:08:09,330 --> 00:08:10,220
Hey,
you're an adult.

162
00:08:10,370 --> 00:08:12,930
You should know how to or you're being 
online bullied.

163
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:13,833
Okay.
You should learn how to kind of chill 

164
00:08:14,931 --> 00:08:17,110
out a little bit,
but I.

165
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:20,210
I don't like a lot of online bullying 
stuff that goes on in terms of,

166
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:21,950
Oh,
you tweeted something wrong.

167
00:08:22,130 --> 00:08:24,590
Let's ruin this guy's life.
Let's get him fired from.

168
00:08:24,591 --> 00:08:26,870
And in many ways,
let's get the guy fired over.

169
00:08:26,871 --> 00:08:27,704
A tweet is probably worse than throwing 
a kindle locker room because that guy 

170
00:08:30,741 --> 00:08:34,220
has a family and that's his livelihood.
Or what happened with say,

171
00:08:34,221 --> 00:08:38,090
Justine Sacco,
you know you can't find a job and like,

172
00:08:38,091 --> 00:08:39,920
well maybe that is even a little bit 
worse.

173
00:08:39,980 --> 00:08:40,813
Know what happens,
right,

174
00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:41,653
so that's a little bit of a sidebar,
but just in case you want to just lay 

175
00:08:43,911 --> 00:08:44,930
that out because it was really.
I mean,

176
00:08:44,931 --> 00:08:48,560
nobody really knew who this woman was.
She put out one tweet,

177
00:08:48,620 --> 00:08:50,080
you can.
Adjusting.

178
00:08:50,090 --> 00:08:53,570
Soco is the best example of the outrage 
culture.

179
00:08:53,750 --> 00:08:56,010
She was a nobody.
Hundred and 20 followers,

180
00:08:56,011 --> 00:08:59,280
all of her friends and she tweeted 
heading to Africa,

181
00:08:59,370 --> 00:09:01,290
hope I don't get aids.
Oh wait,

182
00:09:01,291 --> 00:09:02,340
I can't.
I'm white,

183
00:09:02,730 --> 00:09:03,600
lol.
Right?

184
00:09:04,020 --> 00:09:04,940
Got a joke.

185
00:09:04,980 --> 00:09:06,520
Yeah,
you're just stupid.

186
00:09:06,900 --> 00:09:09,840
She was a hipster.
She was actually trying to be ironic and

187
00:09:09,841 --> 00:09:10,674
she gets on a plane for Africa back then
he had have wifi on the plane to Africa 

188
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:16,950
and she's in the air and I shouldn't 
laugh.

189
00:09:16,951 --> 00:09:19,440
It's actually a tragic story.
They started a Hashtag.

190
00:09:19,441 --> 00:09:23,730
Has Justine landed yet everybody now 
hates justine sacco.

191
00:09:23,731 --> 00:09:25,320
She's evil.
Nobody said,

192
00:09:25,321 --> 00:09:27,090
hey,
what'd you mean by this?

193
00:09:27,091 --> 00:09:28,020
You know,
what's going on?

194
00:09:28,170 --> 00:09:30,690
And to be clear,
nobody really knew who this person was.

195
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:34,740
So this was just the perfect example of 
the Internet going crazy.

196
00:09:34,770 --> 00:09:35,910
Yeah,
she was a nobody.

197
00:09:35,911 --> 00:09:38,280
She wasn't a public figure.
She didn't work in tech.

198
00:09:38,580 --> 00:09:40,980
What happened?
Probably one of her coworkers saw it and

199
00:09:41,010 --> 00:09:45,030
wanted to do a little backstabbing.
It was somebody made personal drama,

200
00:09:45,060 --> 00:09:45,893
international news.
Everybody went after her and it touches 

201
00:09:48,331 --> 00:09:49,320
on so many themes were.

202
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:50,790
Well,
I mean that's a woman.

203
00:09:50,791 --> 00:09:53,010
She was getting.
Rape threats are the people,

204
00:09:53,030 --> 00:09:55,320
the social justice warriors,
the activist.

205
00:09:55,830 --> 00:09:58,650
If you're leading a sort of hate mob on 
a woman who gets raped,

206
00:09:58,651 --> 00:10:00,510
threats will wait.
Isn't that what you say?

207
00:10:00,511 --> 00:10:02,370
I do,
but I've never done that.

208
00:10:02,540 --> 00:10:03,720
I would never do that.
Okay,

209
00:10:03,721 --> 00:10:06,600
so let's hold off on some of the social 
justice stuff first,

210
00:10:06,601 --> 00:10:07,411
but.
And by the way,

211
00:10:07,411 --> 00:10:10,380
I want to go on the record.
I did not jump on that twitter bandwagon

212
00:10:10,381 --> 00:10:12,300
because I remember thinking this is 
crazy.

213
00:10:12,301 --> 00:10:14,910
This is just some person who said some 
stupid things,

214
00:10:14,911 --> 00:10:15,744
so I can't be outraged by somebody I 
never heard of until I saw this little 

215
00:10:18,181 --> 00:10:19,014
tweet,
but a little bit back to your history 

216
00:10:19,801 --> 00:10:20,840
and then we'll look up on some of the 
others.

217
00:10:20,850 --> 00:10:23,190
Yeah,
so then I was deciding on where to go to

218
00:10:23,191 --> 00:10:23,730
law school.

219
00:10:23,730 --> 00:10:24,910
I looked at a map.
I,

220
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:25,873
I read that the data,
the data says you're gonna live within 

221
00:10:28,681 --> 00:10:31,260
50 miles of where I go to law school 
statistically speaking,

222
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:32,333
and I go,
well if I go to law school in Illinois 

223
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:35,490
that means my life will be a little 
strip on Illinois.

224
00:10:35,910 --> 00:10:37,290
I said,
I'll move to California.

225
00:10:37,620 --> 00:10:42,620
Kind of too big of a language.
I'm too afraid to go live in la to go to

226
00:10:43,081 --> 00:10:47,700
ucla because I was too big of a pussy to
go live in La.

227
00:10:47,701 --> 00:10:48,534
I'm a small town kid.
I'm driving on the 10 for the first 

228
00:10:50,131 --> 00:10:51,030
time,
like Oh shit,

229
00:10:51,031 --> 00:10:52,200
you know,
how do people,

230
00:10:52,201 --> 00:10:53,034
how do people drive traffic?
But I figured that I could go to 

231
00:10:54,781 --> 00:10:58,370
pepperdine in Malibu and then I could 
kind of visit las.

232
00:10:58,380 --> 00:11:01,620
I wanted to.
So Malibu is a very small town vibe.

233
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:02,850
Best of both worlds.

234
00:11:02,940 --> 00:11:04,260
Yeah.
And you're right on the beach.

235
00:11:04,261 --> 00:11:05,094
It's pretty,
pretty sweet operation over there at 

236
00:11:06,031 --> 00:11:06,930
pepperdine.
I mean,

237
00:11:06,931 --> 00:11:10,590
you know how it is wherever you are,
you don't appreciate what you have first

238
00:11:10,591 --> 00:11:12,120
couple of days.
It's magical.

239
00:11:12,150 --> 00:11:12,983
Majestic.
After that you just look into the law 

240
00:11:14,971 --> 00:11:16,100
books anyway.
Right.

241
00:11:16,170 --> 00:11:16,890
Okay.
So you,

242
00:11:16,890 --> 00:11:17,723
so you became a lawyer,
but then really what put you into the 

243
00:11:19,861 --> 00:11:22,410
public space was you wrote your book,
the gorilla mindset.

244
00:11:22,411 --> 00:11:24,570
Yeah.
And it's very much a.

245
00:11:24,571 --> 00:11:25,830
I'll let you explain it,
but the,

246
00:11:25,850 --> 00:11:30,480
my main takeaway is sort of that you 
control your destiny is sort of the,

247
00:11:30,660 --> 00:11:34,320
the takeaway that I got.
But what made you write it and is that,

248
00:11:34,321 --> 00:11:35,760
do you think that's a fair assessment?
Yeah,

249
00:11:35,761 --> 00:11:38,610
it's you,
you see defined within certain confines,

250
00:11:38,611 --> 00:11:40,040
your own reality.
You know,

251
00:11:40,050 --> 00:11:42,810
you're Dave Rubin on Mike Cernovich.
Your life is your life.

252
00:11:42,811 --> 00:11:43,644
My life is my life,
but we're going to have different 

253
00:11:44,671 --> 00:11:47,910
experiences in terms of how you live on 
a day to day basis,

254
00:11:47,911 --> 00:11:49,470
but we got the same drama.

255
00:11:49,830 --> 00:11:53,250
We're pissed off at people.
We don't feel like we got recognition.

256
00:11:53,410 --> 00:11:56,410
We wonder if we're gonna lose our jobs.
How am I gonna make money doing this.

257
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:57,393
What if I,
you know,

258
00:11:57,400 --> 00:12:00,580
ask that girl or guy out on a date or 
what if they think I'm dumb.

259
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:01,873
I'm,
I'm afraid to go on TV because people 

260
00:12:03,011 --> 00:12:04,930
think I look stupid.
I sound funny.

261
00:12:04,931 --> 00:12:08,050
What if I say the wrong thing,
we all got the same problems,

262
00:12:08,340 --> 00:12:09,820
you know,
how am I going to pay my bill?

263
00:12:09,821 --> 00:12:12,250
So ultimately you want to control your 
thoughts.

264
00:12:12,251 --> 00:12:14,770
You want to control your emotions,
learn how to,

265
00:12:14,910 --> 00:12:15,743
to not lose it essentially.
And the reason I wrote this because I 

266
00:12:18,431 --> 00:12:20,620
went through a lot of drama,
had a lot of,

267
00:12:20,621 --> 00:12:21,430
you know,
you grew up,

268
00:12:21,430 --> 00:12:23,470
you grew up poor,
now you're in the big city,

269
00:12:23,471 --> 00:12:25,300
you've got to figure it out.
You have,

270
00:12:25,301 --> 00:12:26,134
um,
you see this in a lot of writing 

271
00:12:27,341 --> 00:12:30,940
actually,
where people tend to be ashamed of their

272
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:31,953
upbringing.

273
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:33,550
So instead of saying,
Hey,

274
00:12:33,551 --> 00:12:35,710
I grew up a poor kid in a small town,
but hey,

275
00:12:35,711 --> 00:12:36,461
here,
here I am.

276
00:12:36,461 --> 00:12:37,750
Now you want to say,
yeah,

277
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:38,633
I hate rednecks.
And because you want to get away from 

278
00:12:41,351 --> 00:12:42,184
that,
right?

279
00:12:42,220 --> 00:12:44,280
So you kind of overreact.
Well why is that?

280
00:12:44,420 --> 00:12:45,253
Because your mindset,
it's the way you're framing your 

281
00:12:46,541 --> 00:12:48,910
background.
So what we tend to do is we think,

282
00:12:48,911 --> 00:12:51,550
well,
I grew up this poor dumb kid.

283
00:12:51,551 --> 00:12:54,250
Why would I ever do with my life?
But you can just say what I mean.

284
00:12:54,251 --> 00:12:57,370
I grew up a poor dumb kid.
I'm here.

285
00:12:57,430 --> 00:12:58,263
I made it somehow I've,
I've learned and I've grown and I start 

286
00:13:00,821 --> 00:13:04,900
to take these background experiences and
create a new future out of those.

287
00:13:04,940 --> 00:13:05,773
Yeah,
it's interesting the way we sort of 

288
00:13:06,651 --> 00:13:07,484
fetishize being the recipient of 
bullying or being the recipient of sort 

289
00:13:12,951 --> 00:13:13,784
of anything bad.
So I think for me I was bullied as much 

290
00:13:17,181 --> 00:13:19,340
as I bullied other kids.
You know what I mean?

291
00:13:19,341 --> 00:13:21,560
Like I really,
I had some kids that I probably bullet,

292
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:22,700
I don't like the word either.
It just,

293
00:13:22,701 --> 00:13:24,380
it's so played out,
it doesn't even mean anything,

294
00:13:24,530 --> 00:13:27,370
but I probably treated some kids pretty 
shitty and the,

295
00:13:27,530 --> 00:13:28,363
the kids that were higher on the social 
thing in high school treated me pretty 

296
00:13:30,981 --> 00:13:32,840
shitty and here I am so,
so big wheel,

297
00:13:33,050 --> 00:13:33,883
big deal.
But we have this idea somehow that if 

298
00:13:35,421 --> 00:13:37,610
you're always on the recipient end of 
it,

299
00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:38,713
but somehow your better.
And that's a really bizarre thing and I 

300
00:13:41,541 --> 00:13:42,590
guess that goes to the heart of your 
book.

301
00:13:42,591 --> 00:13:44,480
You have to be the one to say,
well,

302
00:13:44,481 --> 00:13:46,550
I'm not going to be bullied anymore.
Right?

303
00:13:46,610 --> 00:13:47,001
Yeah.
Well,

304
00:13:47,001 --> 00:13:47,834
we ultimately define our realities based
on other people and there's a lot of 

305
00:13:50,961 --> 00:13:53,510
reasons for that and we should.
And I teach you don't do that.

306
00:13:53,511 --> 00:13:55,430
So for example,
shame.

307
00:13:55,940 --> 00:13:57,680
We've all been ashamed.
Oh my God,

308
00:13:57,681 --> 00:13:58,790
I'm embarrassed.
Well,

309
00:13:58,791 --> 00:13:59,720
why?
Oh,

310
00:13:59,750 --> 00:14:02,660
some complete stranger thinks you're an 
idiot,

311
00:14:02,980 --> 00:14:03,950
right?
Well,

312
00:14:04,100 --> 00:14:06,410
why are you letting that other person to
find your own reality?

313
00:14:06,411 --> 00:14:09,530
Which is what you do when you let people
shame you,

314
00:14:09,820 --> 00:14:11,650
attack you,
sort of bullying you.

315
00:14:11,820 --> 00:14:12,710
You're now saying,
well,

316
00:14:12,711 --> 00:14:14,780
I'm going to let other people control 
how I feel.

317
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:15,920
And then he started to think,
well,

318
00:14:15,921 --> 00:14:17,750
why would I let other people control how
you feel?

319
00:14:17,751 --> 00:14:20,970
How does this make any sense of my life?
And then he start to reframe that,

320
00:14:20,971 --> 00:14:24,260
that kind of stuff,
and to a stronger mindset.

321
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:25,193
Yeah.
So that concept is very much in line 

322
00:14:27,451 --> 00:14:28,284
with the online culture.
And I know you're a big part of this 

323
00:14:29,881 --> 00:14:32,380
because I see you,
I see you fighting with people online.

324
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:34,800
You're calling people out,
people are attacking you.

325
00:14:34,801 --> 00:14:35,940
I mean,
you're really in it,

326
00:14:36,180 --> 00:14:38,460
in the,
in the sort of like back and forth piece

327
00:14:38,461 --> 00:14:39,490
of it.
Um,

328
00:14:39,870 --> 00:14:40,703
so I guess the way you deal with that is
that you just don't take any of it too 

329
00:14:43,561 --> 00:14:44,330
personally,
right?

330
00:14:44,330 --> 00:14:46,790
You can't take them personally and you 
always have to.

331
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:49,220
You always got to take a negative 
rifampin.

332
00:14:49,221 --> 00:14:51,560
It,
reframe it as a positive it cliche,

333
00:14:51,561 --> 00:14:53,240
but you could say,
oh my God,

334
00:14:53,241 --> 00:14:55,970
I have all these people saying mean 
things about me.

335
00:14:56,210 --> 00:14:57,320
Or You could just say,
wow,

336
00:14:57,321 --> 00:14:58,154
this is great.
How do these idiots that I've never 

337
00:14:59,901 --> 00:15:01,800
heard of hear about me?
Well,

338
00:15:01,801 --> 00:15:04,220
I must be doing something right.
It must be making impact.

339
00:15:04,221 --> 00:15:09,080
So you can let criticism define you.
Madonna said this one's actually,

340
00:15:09,081 --> 00:15:09,914
she goes,
if I go into a room and there are 100 

341
00:15:11,661 --> 00:15:14,570
people and 99 people like me and one 
person doesn't,

342
00:15:14,750 --> 00:15:17,150
that one person who doesn't like me,
that's what sticks with me.

343
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:18,633
And we,
we tend to be hardwired as human beings 

344
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:21,073
to let criticism bother us,
which makes sense because if we're 

345
00:15:23,571 --> 00:15:26,570
living in a small tribe,
150 people there,

346
00:15:26,690 --> 00:15:28,270
if five guys don't like you,
you know,

347
00:15:28,330 --> 00:15:30,720
they might take you out on the hunting 
trip and kill you.

348
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:31,553
Right?
But we're not in that environment 

349
00:15:32,781 --> 00:15:34,430
anymore.
We're in a big global environment.

350
00:15:35,030 --> 00:15:36,200
I've even written about,
you know,

351
00:15:36,201 --> 00:15:37,440
you just have to niche.
If,

352
00:15:37,670 --> 00:15:41,180
if 99 percent of the world hates me one 
percent like me,

353
00:15:41,540 --> 00:15:43,040
dude,
I'd be filthy rich.

354
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:45,380
That would be great.
You know,

355
00:15:45,381 --> 00:15:46,214
I would,
I would love to have 99 percent of the 

356
00:15:47,361 --> 00:15:48,194
world hate me.
I mean that's always reminds me of the 

357
00:15:49,971 --> 00:15:54,971
thing from Howard Stern's book and in 
the movie when they're talking about the

358
00:15:55,490 --> 00:15:57,260
executives are like,
you know,

359
00:15:57,261 --> 00:15:58,094
the people that like you watch you for 
four minutes and the people that hate 

360
00:16:01,281 --> 00:16:03,680
you watch or listen to you for three 
hours or something.

361
00:16:03,740 --> 00:16:04,573
Well my haters dredge up posts that I 
wrote maybe when I was in a bad mood or 

362
00:16:08,241 --> 00:16:09,070
whatever.
And I'll,

363
00:16:09,070 --> 00:16:11,930
I don't even remember this.
Like how do you guys find this stuff?

364
00:16:11,931 --> 00:16:12,764
Or they'll,
they'll cite confronting you with 

365
00:16:13,521 --> 00:16:14,250
things.

366
00:16:14,250 --> 00:16:15,081
I know you.
I'm like,

367
00:16:15,081 --> 00:16:16,070
wow,
you guys are great.

368
00:16:16,130 --> 00:16:18,800
You're pulling up these archives that I 
don't even remember.

369
00:16:19,170 --> 00:16:20,990
Right?
So that's a good,

370
00:16:20,991 --> 00:16:21,824
a good transition for everything I think
that's going on in the country right 

371
00:16:24,651 --> 00:16:25,484
now.
Because everyone's outraged all the 

372
00:16:26,271 --> 00:16:27,890
time.
We're all offended all the time.

373
00:16:27,891 --> 00:16:29,780
We're looking for people to attack all 
the time.

374
00:16:30,410 --> 00:16:34,370
Incomes Donald trump into this thing.
Now you're a Donald Trump supporter,

375
00:16:34,371 --> 00:16:34,880
right?
Yeah.

376
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:38,120
Endorsed Donald Trump,
endorsed Donald Trump.

377
00:16:38,180 --> 00:16:39,013
Uh,
I believe you're the first trump 

378
00:16:40,461 --> 00:16:43,580
supporter that I've had on the show.
So congratulations on that.

379
00:16:43,750 --> 00:16:44,583
Uh,
I shared my feelings at the beginning 

380
00:16:45,381 --> 00:16:46,214
about trump,
but before I give you more of my 

381
00:16:47,571 --> 00:16:48,404
feelings,
so give me why is this working for 

382
00:16:49,821 --> 00:16:52,440
trump?
Truth working like them or not this.

383
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:54,260
Nobody's reading that.
Okay?

384
00:16:54,261 --> 00:16:57,620
So when you have a reaction,
you're going to have a counter reaction.

385
00:16:57,950 --> 00:16:58,910
Here's the world we live in.

386
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:01,460
You're a liberal.
You're a reasonable guy.

387
00:17:01,730 --> 00:17:06,010
Okay?
That's not most liberals that just,

388
00:17:06,020 --> 00:17:07,340
not sadly,
I'm with you on that.

389
00:17:07,370 --> 00:17:11,420
That's just reality.
We've now taken God who's dead.

390
00:17:11,421 --> 00:17:12,254
We don't have religion.
We now have the religion of political 

391
00:17:14,121 --> 00:17:14,954
correctness.
The liberals have now turned into a 

392
00:17:16,521 --> 00:17:18,740
religion where you know,
I can say,

393
00:17:18,770 --> 00:17:20,090
well,
you believe these things.

394
00:17:20,091 --> 00:17:20,930
Well,
I think you're wrong.

395
00:17:20,931 --> 00:17:23,000
Maybe if we talk about it,
I'll just get through to you.

396
00:17:23,320 --> 00:17:25,850
Well,
now I don't even look at how you live.

397
00:17:26,180 --> 00:17:27,980
You make a bad tweet,
your evil,

398
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:31,100
you think something about this,
you're a bad person.

399
00:17:31,101 --> 00:17:32,720
You know?
I always use an example of,

400
00:17:33,190 --> 00:17:35,450
you know,
like a lot of people have facebook drama

401
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:38,120
by people who knew him and this happened
recently,

402
00:17:38,330 --> 00:17:40,040
so we know this guy,
great guy,

403
00:17:40,041 --> 00:17:43,070
he's actually liberal,
all these liberal friends and he posted,

404
00:17:43,730 --> 00:17:44,563
you know guys,
I just think it's weird that Bruce 

405
00:17:46,490 --> 00:17:48,920
Jenner now like as a woman and it's 
Caitlin.

406
00:17:49,050 --> 00:17:51,960
I just think it's really weird that you 
would want to do that.

407
00:17:52,380 --> 00:17:54,450
And his friends were like,
oh my God,

408
00:17:54,451 --> 00:17:56,790
you're transphobic big.
I can't believe you said this.

409
00:17:56,910 --> 00:18:00,780
They were texting back channel.
I thought this was a good person,

410
00:18:01,710 --> 00:18:03,000
but it's weird,
right?

411
00:18:03,001 --> 00:18:05,670
This is a guy who you've only known to 
be a decent guy for all time.

412
00:18:05,671 --> 00:18:09,840
He says something that probably a lot of
people are actually thinking privately.

413
00:18:09,841 --> 00:18:11,760
Like there's something I want to say 
weird.

414
00:18:11,761 --> 00:18:14,190
I know Trans People,
Trans people are our great people.

415
00:18:14,191 --> 00:18:15,024
I have obviously no issue with them,
but somebody could say that and that in 

416
00:18:18,991 --> 00:18:21,390
and of itself doesn't make them a well,
I'm weird.

417
00:18:21,450 --> 00:18:23,310
You're weird.
Why do you want to be on TV?

418
00:18:23,380 --> 00:18:25,080
Right?
Why do I have a podcast?

419
00:18:25,081 --> 00:18:27,840
Why do I troll the Internet bullied when
I was right?

420
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:29,033
That's the whole thing.
It's this concept that if you live a 

421
00:18:31,201 --> 00:18:32,034
lifestyle that is deviant,
deviant doesn't necessarily always mean 

422
00:18:34,111 --> 00:18:34,650
bad.

423
00:18:34,650 --> 00:18:38,280
Weird doesn't mean a moral judgment.
It just means wow,

424
00:18:38,281 --> 00:18:40,290
that's out of the realm of my 
experience.

425
00:18:40,370 --> 00:18:41,203
Right?
A lot of people saw what I did early on 

426
00:18:42,751 --> 00:18:44,340
before I caught on.
I was like,

427
00:18:44,341 --> 00:18:45,174
no,
trust me,

428
00:18:45,300 --> 00:18:47,310
like I know what I'm doing,
but they're like,

429
00:18:47,311 --> 00:18:48,300
dude,
you're on twitter.

430
00:18:48,301 --> 00:18:50,160
You're just a maniac.
What are people going to think?

431
00:18:50,161 --> 00:18:50,940
And I go,
just try.

432
00:18:50,940 --> 00:18:51,930
But if people said,
Mike,

433
00:18:51,931 --> 00:18:54,480
I think that's weird.
I think it's a waste of time.

434
00:18:54,660 --> 00:18:56,250
Maybe you're mentally ill.
I would say,

435
00:18:56,310 --> 00:18:57,420
ah,
I get it.

436
00:18:57,760 --> 00:18:59,690
You're wrong.
I get it right now.

437
00:18:59,970 --> 00:19:02,490
I don't think you're a bad person for 
making that judgment,

438
00:19:02,491 --> 00:19:06,970
so a lot of times we want to now think 
everything is a character attack when,

439
00:19:07,110 --> 00:19:08,310
when ultimately you're just saying,
well,

440
00:19:08,311 --> 00:19:09,144
this is fucking weird.
I don't really understand it and what 

441
00:19:12,630 --> 00:19:14,460
you do when somebody doesn't understand 
something and you say,

442
00:19:14,461 --> 00:19:16,890
well actually I mean is gender binary?

443
00:19:16,900 --> 00:19:17,733
What about brain?
But then you get into other issues too 

444
00:19:19,651 --> 00:19:20,484
where you're saying,
well,

445
00:19:20,610 --> 00:19:23,700
I thought gender is a social construct 
and there is no male female brain,

446
00:19:23,970 --> 00:19:26,130
but if there's no male brain and no 
female brain,

447
00:19:26,460 --> 00:19:29,340
then how can I be a male body with the 
female brain?

448
00:19:29,490 --> 00:19:31,680
Right.
And it's hard to extrapolate all that on

449
00:19:31,681 --> 00:19:33,420
twitter.
So instead people are just like,

450
00:19:34,980 --> 00:19:36,440
you hate everybody.
Yeah.

451
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:37,880
So the interesting thing,
and then we'll get back.

452
00:19:37,900 --> 00:19:41,490
The trouble with the,
with the Trans situation is that,

453
00:19:41,700 --> 00:19:42,990
you know,
Caitlyn Jenner,

454
00:19:42,991 --> 00:19:47,490
now people are turning the left is 
turning on her now because she said that

455
00:19:47,491 --> 00:19:50,400
she's supporting Ted Cruz and I watched 
it.

456
00:19:50,410 --> 00:19:51,243
I've never watched any of that show,
but I did watch the little five minute 

457
00:19:53,580 --> 00:19:57,420
part where she was sort of defending why
she's a Republican and you know,

458
00:19:57,530 --> 00:19:58,790
they're debating and the people,
you know,

459
00:19:58,800 --> 00:19:59,633
she's arguing with these housewives or 
whatever these people are that have no 

460
00:20:01,591 --> 00:20:02,424
idea what they're talking about,
but I've seen now people on the left 

461
00:20:05,041 --> 00:20:07,350
turning on her because she has a 
different political view.

462
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:09,900
So two months ago she was a hero to 
them.

463
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:12,600
But now you think differently 
politically,

464
00:20:12,990 --> 00:20:15,300
so now you're evil and that there's a 
danger there.

465
00:20:15,420 --> 00:20:16,253
Yeah,
and I'll confess that I did watch the 

466
00:20:17,581 --> 00:20:18,414
show for research.
We'll call her research Sherita and a 

467
00:20:21,660 --> 00:20:23,580
Caitlin's position was,
hey,

468
00:20:23,581 --> 00:20:26,010
we're 7 trillion in debt.
I like,

469
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:26,933
yeah,
we should be able to use the same 

470
00:20:28,231 --> 00:20:31,680
restrooms,
but come on like if the country falls,

471
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:33,450
everybody's gone.
You know.

472
00:20:33,451 --> 00:20:36,570
So it isn't even that the views are 
wrong,

473
00:20:36,580 --> 00:20:38,100
the views are just,
hey,

474
00:20:38,101 --> 00:20:40,350
I'm focused on bigger issues.
You know,

475
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:43,020
what happens to a country if our economy
collapses,

476
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:44,033
well you're going to have a lot bigger 
worries then can you use the unisex 

477
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:48,670
bathroom?
And.

478
00:20:48,671 --> 00:20:50,620
But people know they don't want to see 
it.

479
00:20:50,621 --> 00:20:54,310
So what happens now is you get fixated 
on this marginal issue.

480
00:20:54,580 --> 00:20:55,413
There's this issue that only affects a 
real small group of people and then 

481
00:20:58,391 --> 00:21:01,510
you're not allowed to focus on any other
issues or else you're evil.

482
00:21:02,020 --> 00:21:04,090
So yeah,
I'm Caitlin would say,

483
00:21:04,091 --> 00:21:06,430
well,
I support Ted Cruz.

484
00:21:06,850 --> 00:21:09,520
Ted Cruz is wrong about this,
but hey,

485
00:21:09,521 --> 00:21:12,430
we got really bigger issues and that 
makes you a bad person.

486
00:21:12,490 --> 00:21:13,323
Right?
So for the person that loves identity 

487
00:21:14,241 --> 00:21:16,880
politics,
this is like a real disconnect for them,

488
00:21:16,881 --> 00:21:17,960
right?
Because they're like,

489
00:21:17,961 --> 00:21:18,890
wait a minute,
wait a minute,

490
00:21:19,130 --> 00:21:19,963
your trans.
So the thing that you're supposed to 

491
00:21:21,531 --> 00:21:24,650
care about most of these trends,
and here you have someone saying,

492
00:21:24,860 --> 00:21:29,390
well actually I care more about the 
economy or security or whatever it is.

493
00:21:29,690 --> 00:21:33,140
And identity politics as I always say,
widows us down to the point where if you

494
00:21:33,141 --> 00:21:36,080
jump out of that little box,
people start freaking out.

495
00:21:36,380 --> 00:21:37,610
Well,
here's what everybody says now,

496
00:21:37,820 --> 00:21:39,680
well,
as a white,

497
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:42,830
straight CIS man,
my experienced this,

498
00:21:42,831 --> 00:21:44,500
this,
and will as a gay man,

499
00:21:44,510 --> 00:21:45,950
my experiences as an,
as a.

500
00:21:46,430 --> 00:21:47,263
So we've taken this sort of personal 
narrative and now we treat that as like 

501
00:21:50,450 --> 00:21:54,500
absolute reality.
There is no issue other than your narrow

502
00:21:54,501 --> 00:21:57,080
slice of experience.
And I think that is not.

503
00:21:57,081 --> 00:21:57,914
I don't think it's a fun way to live.
I don't know why anybody would want to 

504
00:21:59,511 --> 00:22:02,180
live that way.
It's a very narcissistic,

505
00:22:02,181 --> 00:22:05,120
narrow view on the world where what you 
want to do is you want to think,

506
00:22:05,121 --> 00:22:06,350
well,
there's a lot of us.

507
00:22:06,530 --> 00:22:09,530
We live in a pluralistic society.
We got gays,

508
00:22:09,531 --> 00:22:10,460
Jews,
Muslims,

509
00:22:10,461 --> 00:22:11,660
blacks,
whites,

510
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:12,553
everybody else.
Why don't we just figure out how to get 

511
00:22:14,871 --> 00:22:16,880
along because we're stuck here together.

512
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:17,753
Right?
And it's almost as if all of those 

513
00:22:18,811 --> 00:22:19,644
groups that you decided have people 
within them who think different things 

514
00:22:22,111 --> 00:22:22,741
than the,
uh,

515
00:22:22,741 --> 00:22:23,574
the bigger group.
I don't know why that's such a 

516
00:22:24,481 --> 00:22:27,150
revolutionary thought,
but it seems to be for a lot of people.

517
00:22:27,151 --> 00:22:28,350
So wait,
we started here with trump.

518
00:22:28,530 --> 00:22:29,790
I don't know how we got over there.
So.

519
00:22:29,791 --> 00:22:31,640
Okay,
so you take all of this,

520
00:22:31,810 --> 00:22:32,643
uh,
this social justice stuff and this fear 

521
00:22:34,141 --> 00:22:37,830
of saying what you think and all that.
And that basically has led us to trump,

522
00:22:37,850 --> 00:22:38,251
right?
Right.

523
00:22:38,251 --> 00:22:40,710
Because trump says anything.
Here's what people say,

524
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:42,580
why do you like trump?
Because they'll say what's,

525
00:22:42,630 --> 00:22:44,520
what's on his mind?
And then people go,

526
00:22:44,521 --> 00:22:45,354
well,
we say what's on our mind when we tell 

527
00:22:46,651 --> 00:22:49,110
you that if you're a white man,
you hate everybody,

528
00:22:49,610 --> 00:22:50,380
you know,
you're vague it.

529
00:22:50,380 --> 00:22:51,151
It's like,
yeah.

530
00:22:51,151 --> 00:22:54,780
And now you have the counterculture.
Countercultures will trump is just going

531
00:22:54,781 --> 00:22:58,440
to say whatever's on his mind.
That's counter to your narrative.

532
00:22:58,770 --> 00:23:00,840
And people like that.
People respect it.

533
00:23:00,980 --> 00:23:01,813
Okay.
So I'm with you on that portion of that 

534
00:23:05,210 --> 00:23:06,980
piece of trump.
I understand.

535
00:23:07,150 --> 00:23:09,200
I'm,
I hate political correctness.

536
00:23:09,590 --> 00:23:11,420
The whole show has been devoted to 
fighting it.

537
00:23:11,570 --> 00:23:13,590
So I understand that portion of it with 
trump.

538
00:23:13,591 --> 00:23:14,720
But I think you just said something 
interesting.

539
00:23:14,900 --> 00:23:15,733
He'll say anything.
And that's where I see the biggest 

540
00:23:17,661 --> 00:23:19,100
problem.
This guy,

541
00:23:19,130 --> 00:23:19,791
people keep saying,
well,

542
00:23:19,791 --> 00:23:22,280
I like him because they'll say anything.
But he's also saying nothing.

543
00:23:22,281 --> 00:23:25,490
At the same time.
He's taken every position on everything.

544
00:23:25,670 --> 00:23:26,503
He watched him in the debates.
He stands now for things he used to be 

545
00:23:29,541 --> 00:23:31,160
against.
In many ways he's,

546
00:23:31,220 --> 00:23:32,053
he's actually for big government.
He certainly not a conservative all of 

547
00:23:34,330 --> 00:23:36,290
those things.
So is that enough for you?

548
00:23:36,291 --> 00:23:38,450
That's the part that I just don't 
understand.

549
00:23:38,451 --> 00:23:40,940
I get people are on it on the emotional 
level,

550
00:23:41,150 --> 00:23:45,200
but is that in and of itself enough for 
you to vote for somebody and be like,

551
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:46,210
this guy.

552
00:23:46,210 --> 00:23:47,670
Okay,
I'll talk about people first.

553
00:23:47,710 --> 00:23:49,780
I'll talk about me.
So people first,

554
00:23:49,781 --> 00:23:51,730
everybody now knows people lie.
Okay.

555
00:23:52,360 --> 00:23:53,193
Obama said in the debates what?
Eight years ago he was asked if he 

556
00:23:55,991 --> 00:23:58,000
supported gay marriage.
What did he say?

557
00:23:58,450 --> 00:23:59,380
Yeah,
he didn't at the time,

558
00:23:59,830 --> 00:24:01,230
but he did.
We all know we did.

559
00:24:01,260 --> 00:24:02,110
Right?
We all know,

560
00:24:02,111 --> 00:24:02,944
we all know that Obama isn't a Muslim or
we all know the obamas almost certainly 

561
00:24:05,801 --> 00:24:09,100
agnostic is certainly not a Muslim.
He's almost certainly not a Christian.

562
00:24:09,310 --> 00:24:11,800
We all knew in those debates he 
supported gay marriage,

563
00:24:12,130 --> 00:24:15,220
but he couldn't say it.
So now the ruse.

564
00:24:15,330 --> 00:24:17,260
It's all over.
We know they're all liars.

565
00:24:17,290 --> 00:24:20,140
They're all scammers there.
You know Obama's drone struck.

566
00:24:20,141 --> 00:24:22,510
People killed all kinds of innocent 
people.

567
00:24:22,690 --> 00:24:23,523
Those wars keep going on.
Not a single Wall Street executive has 

568
00:24:26,111 --> 00:24:27,910
been indicted.
We know of Clinton.

569
00:24:28,120 --> 00:24:29,440
Oh,
I'm tough on Wall Street.

570
00:24:29,560 --> 00:24:32,470
We know not a single person.
We all know it's bullshit.

571
00:24:32,710 --> 00:24:36,400
We all know it's a scam.
So then what happens is if it's a scam,

572
00:24:37,090 --> 00:24:37,923
well then you just go with the best 
showman and that's where we are now in 

573
00:24:40,241 --> 00:24:42,070
life.
We're going to go with the best show.

574
00:24:42,140 --> 00:24:43,210
That's people.
Now,

575
00:24:43,211 --> 00:24:44,044
me personally,
here's what I think trump is ultimately 

576
00:24:46,751 --> 00:24:49,060
I,
and this could be my own delusions,

577
00:24:49,660 --> 00:24:50,493
but my views and trump's are very 
similar in that I'm a libertarian with 

578
00:24:54,910 --> 00:24:55,743
nationalist tendencies,
and what that means is you got to close 

579
00:24:57,701 --> 00:24:59,860
the border.
You've got to make sure the right people

580
00:24:59,861 --> 00:25:00,694
get in.
You can't let intolerant people in and 

581
00:25:02,831 --> 00:25:06,550
then large amounts of social freedom 
within the country,

582
00:25:06,850 --> 00:25:08,690
and that's always been trump's position.
That's what I said.

583
00:25:08,700 --> 00:25:09,910
Well,
trump is a liberal on this.

584
00:25:10,040 --> 00:25:13,750
Of course he is of course,
is if you live in a society where people

585
00:25:13,751 --> 00:25:16,780
can kind of get along and you lead them 
the right people,

586
00:25:17,020 --> 00:25:18,670
then you can be socially liberal.

587
00:25:18,820 --> 00:25:19,653
Right?
But do you think that the ends justify 

588
00:25:21,191 --> 00:25:23,380
the means?
I guess that that's where I'm struggling

589
00:25:23,381 --> 00:25:26,770
with this situation with him because I 
think that ultimately,

590
00:25:26,771 --> 00:25:28,120
and this is what I said at the top of 
the show,

591
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:29,193
if he got in,
this is not someone who would respect 

592
00:25:31,720 --> 00:25:32,553
any law that we have.
I don't think he would accept that the 

593
00:25:35,831 --> 00:25:36,664
executive branch,
that the president is only one third of 

594
00:25:39,581 --> 00:25:42,340
the government.
I think he would do whatever he wants.

595
00:25:42,341 --> 00:25:44,290
The example I gave is that,
you know,

596
00:25:44,291 --> 00:25:45,880
he,
because he says anything,

597
00:25:46,030 --> 00:25:47,020
he said,
well I'm going to,

598
00:25:47,050 --> 00:25:47,883
when I'm president of starbucks is going
to put merry Christmas back on Chris on 

599
00:25:51,270 --> 00:25:53,100
their coffee cups.
That's a car.

600
00:25:53,140 --> 00:25:55,450
I know.
It's just that I got you already.

601
00:25:55,750 --> 00:25:58,150
You know,
like he's just saying something crazy.

602
00:25:58,360 --> 00:26:01,840
But I think that that line of thinking 
is actually dangerous.

603
00:26:01,841 --> 00:26:06,040
Isn't that what leads us to fascism when
you have a guy who comes in and says,

604
00:26:06,041 --> 00:26:07,220
I'm going to do whatever I want.
I mean,

605
00:26:07,221 --> 00:26:08,680
he's telling us right now.
Right,

606
00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:09,621
right.
Well,

607
00:26:09,621 --> 00:26:11,690
one of my specialties that's actually 
common law.

608
00:26:11,900 --> 00:26:12,733
The three branches of government issue 
mentioned who has the power to declare 

609
00:26:15,321 --> 00:26:16,154
war,
the sole power to declare war congress 

610
00:26:18,351 --> 00:26:19,184
has the power.
How many words that we had since World 

611
00:26:21,470 --> 00:26:22,050
War Two?

612
00:26:22,050 --> 00:26:24,610
Uh,
probably 15.

613
00:26:25,370 --> 00:26:26,390
How many times?
600.

614
00:26:26,391 --> 00:26:28,610
I'm not sure.
How many times is Congress declared war,

615
00:26:29,150 --> 00:26:30,050
right?
Probably once or.

616
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:31,400
Yeah,
it hasn't happened.

617
00:26:31,460 --> 00:26:33,450
So we've had Vietnam,
Korea war,

618
00:26:33,451 --> 00:26:34,800
a police action.
Uh,

619
00:26:35,220 --> 00:26:36,590
the Iraq,
the first one,

620
00:26:36,591 --> 00:26:38,390
the second Iraq war,
Afghanistan.

621
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:39,980
All right.
Libya,

622
00:26:39,981 --> 00:26:40,814
which Obama did.
The executive hasn't respected the 

623
00:26:44,041 --> 00:26:44,874
legislative branch for a long time.
And what's interesting is that you can 

624
00:26:47,191 --> 00:26:48,024
go back to before Obama was elected and 
you can see liberal saying we have an 

625
00:26:52,801 --> 00:26:54,480
executive out of control.
No sub,

626
00:26:54,990 --> 00:26:57,030
right?
And then when Obama was elected,

627
00:26:57,031 --> 00:26:59,790
the Conservatives at the Cato Institute 
and everybody like Obama's,

628
00:26:59,980 --> 00:27:01,110
you know,
out of control and,

629
00:27:01,590 --> 00:27:04,230
but they all flip flopped on the issue.
So again,

630
00:27:04,231 --> 00:27:05,064
as a constitutional law school,
and I actually am a constitutional law 

631
00:27:07,111 --> 00:27:08,700
scholar.
It's all bullshit.

632
00:27:08,701 --> 00:27:09,870
Anyway.
Everybody,

633
00:27:09,871 --> 00:27:13,050
everybody flip flops on who now?
Trump,

634
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:15,570
what can you really do?
Right?

635
00:27:15,990 --> 00:27:16,823
You can't really do that much.
That's the idea that the president is 

636
00:27:18,811 --> 00:27:21,840
that powerful.
He's going to be stopped.

637
00:27:22,470 --> 00:27:23,940
He's going to be stopped.
Meaning what?

638
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:24,833
Meaning he's the really crazy stuff that
people think you're not going to round 

639
00:27:28,441 --> 00:27:29,790
up 12 million people.
Okay.

640
00:27:29,940 --> 00:27:31,890
You're not going to create a federal 
police force.

641
00:27:32,010 --> 00:27:35,100
Round up 12 million people start kicking
down doors.

642
00:27:35,420 --> 00:27:36,240
It just,
it's,

643
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:37,620
it's not gonna happen.
Right,

644
00:27:37,621 --> 00:27:40,680
and actually I don't think that's really
what he wants also,

645
00:27:40,870 --> 00:27:42,780
but he's saying that's what I'm saying 
here,

646
00:27:43,030 --> 00:27:43,863
this idea,
if you just follow the ideas of what he 

647
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:48,330
saying,
this leads us to a bad place.

648
00:27:48,390 --> 00:27:51,480
This is a no defense of the 
establishment and I get it.

649
00:27:51,481 --> 00:27:55,350
I have given Obama Shit on right now.
We're bombing Syria right as we sit here

650
00:27:55,470 --> 00:27:57,450
with no congressional authorization,
so I get it.

651
00:27:57,660 --> 00:27:58,493
They all do this terrible stuff,
but I think the through line of the 

652
00:28:01,441 --> 00:28:05,280
trump thinking leads us to a guy for 
years later who,

653
00:28:05,281 --> 00:28:07,740
who will be next that that's what I fear
here.

654
00:28:08,460 --> 00:28:10,650
Who will be next?
I don't know.

655
00:28:10,680 --> 00:28:11,513
Right.
That's the thing is I wish I could see 

656
00:28:13,111 --> 00:28:13,944
the future,
but what if trump actually does a great 

657
00:28:15,901 --> 00:28:16,734
job?
What if trump actually takes on Wall 

658
00:28:17,671 --> 00:28:18,504
Street?
What if trump does solve the problem 

659
00:28:20,851 --> 00:28:22,980
with the water,
which is a problem.

660
00:28:23,130 --> 00:28:26,600
Our social services our way over stress.
Now we,

661
00:28:26,690 --> 00:28:27,523
we can't.
Anybody who's ever gone to an er in 

662
00:28:28,801 --> 00:28:31,680
California talk to any er doctor,
it is.

663
00:28:31,681 --> 00:28:34,770
It is a real mess.
So what trump is doing is he's setting a

664
00:28:34,771 --> 00:28:36,360
cultural town.
He's just saying,

665
00:28:36,361 --> 00:28:38,220
okay,
we got to figure this stuff out,

666
00:28:38,520 --> 00:28:40,110
which,
which is what we need to do.

667
00:28:40,290 --> 00:28:43,500
Okay?
Adults need to sit down at the table and

668
00:28:43,501 --> 00:28:44,370
figure out,
okay,

669
00:28:44,371 --> 00:28:46,500
we have illegal immigrants.
What are we going to do?

670
00:28:46,710 --> 00:28:47,543
Well,
the path that everybody is taken is to 

671
00:28:49,021 --> 00:28:49,831
say,
well,

672
00:28:49,831 --> 00:28:51,860
yeah,
well maybe amnesty,

673
00:28:51,880 --> 00:28:54,050
maybe you know,
a path decisions chip,

674
00:28:54,060 --> 00:28:56,760
maybe this and maybe it will clear up 
the border and maybe we'll do this.

675
00:28:56,760 --> 00:28:58,830
Maybe we'll do that.
Well,

676
00:28:58,831 --> 00:29:02,520
it's time to actually take an extreme 
position because what happens,

677
00:29:02,521 --> 00:29:03,670
right?
The overton,

678
00:29:03,810 --> 00:29:04,890
you know,
negotiation.

679
00:29:04,920 --> 00:29:05,850
How much do you want?
Well,

680
00:29:05,851 --> 00:29:08,310
I want a billion dollars a year.
You're out of your mind,

681
00:29:08,490 --> 00:29:12,030
but now you've anchored and and all this
stuff is cognitive bias persuasion,

682
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:13,230
the anchoring bias,
right?

683
00:29:13,231 --> 00:29:16,080
He's very open about this by the way,
about how he would negotiate.

684
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:18,330
He says,
I'm just staking out something crazy.

685
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:19,313
Right?
So there've been all these studies 

686
00:29:20,281 --> 00:29:21,540
that'll show if I say,
well,

687
00:29:21,541 --> 00:29:24,930
how many books do you think we're in the
library of Alexandria?

688
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:27,540
Twenty million or 1 million.
Well,

689
00:29:27,541 --> 00:29:29,250
depending on if I say 20,
if I say,

690
00:29:29,251 --> 00:29:30,660
do you think there was 20 million or 
more?

691
00:29:30,870 --> 00:29:31,321
You'll say,
well,

692
00:29:31,321 --> 00:29:32,820
I think there was 30 million.
Right?

693
00:29:33,060 --> 00:29:34,100
But if I say,
well,

694
00:29:34,110 --> 00:29:34,943
do you think there was more than 1 
million or less than a million books in 

695
00:29:36,961 --> 00:29:37,530
there?

696
00:29:37,530 --> 00:29:40,560
You're going to be closer to a million.
All because of the anchoring.

697
00:29:40,561 --> 00:29:43,720
Cognitive bias.
So trump is just creating an anchor,

698
00:29:43,810 --> 00:29:44,643
a really strong anchor point,
and then from there you work your way 

699
00:29:47,171 --> 00:29:49,510
down and most people don't do that in 
your real life.

700
00:29:49,660 --> 00:29:50,950
Most people you think,
okay,

701
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:52,353
I want this job.
Well I better ask for a salary pretty 

702
00:29:54,611 --> 00:29:59,080
close to what I think they'll give me.
Asked for 50 percent more,

703
00:29:59,530 --> 00:30:01,210
right,
because they're not going to say,

704
00:30:01,211 --> 00:30:02,890
well that's,
you've asked her way too much,

705
00:30:03,190 --> 00:30:04,023
would you just not get hired at all?
Now you've anchored or bigger number on 

706
00:30:06,161 --> 00:30:09,520
them and now you have a little bit of 
leverage and then you work from there.

707
00:30:09,780 --> 00:30:10,613
So interestingly,
what trump is doing in certain way is 

708
00:30:12,261 --> 00:30:15,790
really what people on the left do,
which is used feeling over Faq.

709
00:30:16,050 --> 00:30:19,470
So I don't think you're defending him on
the fact based stuff.

710
00:30:19,500 --> 00:30:20,970
Right?
This is all emotional,

711
00:30:20,980 --> 00:30:21,813
right?
You're defending him on the emotional 

712
00:30:22,651 --> 00:30:23,400
based stuff.
So that's,

713
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:26,490
that's fascinating because I see people 
on the right all the time.

714
00:30:26,491 --> 00:30:29,370
Say I had Ben Shapiro who sat in that 
chair a couple of weeks ago saying,

715
00:30:29,371 --> 00:30:30,204
you know,
all the people on the left care about 

716
00:30:31,831 --> 00:30:34,980
feeling more than fact.
And what you're saying basically is that

717
00:30:34,981 --> 00:30:38,280
trump is using that very tactic and yet 
he's running.

718
00:30:38,580 --> 00:30:41,450
I'm on the right so by all humans.
So it's,

719
00:30:41,451 --> 00:30:42,284
it's.
He really should be running on the left 

720
00:30:43,291 --> 00:30:46,140
and then they would all love him because
he's giving them field.

721
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:48,510
If it was just the feel good stuff,
that they feel good about it,

722
00:30:48,630 --> 00:30:51,620
he's just giving the people on the right
something that they feel good about.

723
00:30:51,700 --> 00:30:56,290
I'm Ted Cruz and I'm a constitutionalist
who believes in liberty and the founding

724
00:30:56,291 --> 00:30:57,124
fathers.
Right,

725
00:30:57,310 --> 00:30:58,143
okay.
Is there a logical statement there that 

726
00:31:00,281 --> 00:31:01,114
you can analyze?

727
00:31:01,180 --> 00:31:02,013
Well,
he believes in liberty and that he 

728
00:31:02,441 --> 00:31:03,740
doesn't want people to marry who they 
want.

729
00:31:04,130 --> 00:31:05,150
Yeah.
What does Liberty Nice.

730
00:31:05,210 --> 00:31:06,950
Right?
Liberty as you imposed,

731
00:31:06,951 --> 00:31:10,560
there was a great scene in Magnolia.
I think that musical movie,

732
00:31:10,561 --> 00:31:12,680
and they go liberty fraternity.
Well,

733
00:31:12,681 --> 00:31:14,250
who could oppose liberty?
Right?

734
00:31:14,300 --> 00:31:15,133
We all do,
but we have a different conception of 

735
00:31:16,071 --> 00:31:18,950
liberty.
If I'm a fundamentalist Christian,

736
00:31:19,130 --> 00:31:19,963
well I want religious liberty and I 
think religious liberty means I 

737
00:31:22,251 --> 00:31:24,410
shouldn't have to bake a cake for gay 
people were okay.

738
00:31:24,590 --> 00:31:25,610
If you're gay,
you think,

739
00:31:25,611 --> 00:31:26,540
well,
I'm an adult.

740
00:31:26,630 --> 00:31:27,463
I should be able to enter into contracts
about my relationship with other 

741
00:31:30,981 --> 00:31:32,940
consenting adults.
So if I just say,

742
00:31:32,941 --> 00:31:33,774
well,
I support liberty.

743
00:31:33,860 --> 00:31:35,210
So then what'd you do as you say?
Well,

744
00:31:35,211 --> 00:31:37,820
Ted Cruz doesn't really support my 
conception of liberty,

745
00:31:37,940 --> 00:31:40,850
but it's all bullshit.
I support the constitution.

746
00:31:41,640 --> 00:31:43,370
Fuck this.
What does that even mean?

747
00:31:43,580 --> 00:31:45,350
Right?
There's a lot in the constitution.

748
00:31:45,351 --> 00:31:48,530
Do you believe abortion is in the 
constitution or not?

749
00:31:48,560 --> 00:31:50,000
Right?
What does it protect?

750
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:51,073
So the idea that politicians run on 
these logical points and that people 

751
00:31:55,730 --> 00:31:58,940
make their conclusions based on logic is
nonsense.

752
00:31:58,941 --> 00:31:59,774
So yeah,
it is funny when people facts over 

753
00:32:00,921 --> 00:32:02,600
feelings.
Well,

754
00:32:02,601 --> 00:32:03,560
I mean look at that,
you know,

755
00:32:03,561 --> 00:32:06,320
not to get too far ahead.
Look at that Michelle fields incident.

756
00:32:06,321 --> 00:32:07,190
We just had,
you know,

757
00:32:07,340 --> 00:32:10,340
oh I was grabbed and almost thrown to 
the ground and this man.

758
00:32:10,341 --> 00:32:12,440
And then you watched the video.
You know,

759
00:32:12,900 --> 00:32:13,733
it's still unclear to me.
So for people that don't know what 

760
00:32:14,701 --> 00:32:15,534
you're talking about,
basically trump's campaign manager 

761
00:32:18,210 --> 00:32:21,210
apparently grabbed Michelle fields who 
was a breitbart reporter.

762
00:32:21,570 --> 00:32:23,940
She showed a little bit of a bruise on 
her arm in a picture.

763
00:32:23,941 --> 00:32:25,740
I've watched the video a thousand times.
It's still,

764
00:32:25,741 --> 00:32:26,730
I just,
I don't know.

765
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:29,160
I've been in those scrums a little bit,
but I've been to those things.

766
00:32:29,161 --> 00:32:30,840
Yeah,
you get people get pushed and pulled and

767
00:32:30,841 --> 00:32:32,260
whatever.
So I don't really know what happened.

768
00:32:32,261 --> 00:32:33,120
So I'll leave it there,
but I.

769
00:32:33,270 --> 00:32:36,360
But your basic take on it is that she's 
a bullshit artist.

770
00:32:36,530 --> 00:32:37,131
Yeah.
It's all.

771
00:32:37,131 --> 00:32:39,980
It's all been overplayed.
She sat on TV.

772
00:32:39,981 --> 00:32:42,290
Well,
other than my dad dying.

773
00:32:42,440 --> 00:32:45,050
This is the worst thing that's ever 
happened to me in my life.

774
00:32:45,530 --> 00:32:46,460
Everybody,
every.

775
00:32:46,490 --> 00:32:47,323
C'Mon.
Everybody uses feelings to manipulate 

776
00:32:49,131 --> 00:32:50,180
people.
If,

777
00:32:50,450 --> 00:32:53,360
if you're about to be fired from a job,
you can make two cases.

778
00:32:53,361 --> 00:32:54,081
Well,
you know,

779
00:32:54,081 --> 00:32:54,914
here's an excel sheet.
Here's how many of you as I bring you 

780
00:32:56,091 --> 00:32:56,924
can bring that into.
And we go way back and you promised me 

781
00:32:59,301 --> 00:33:00,740
this last.
All emotions,

782
00:33:00,770 --> 00:33:01,603
right?
We make most of our decisions based on 

783
00:33:03,351 --> 00:33:04,184
emotions.
We respect leaders based on we're 

784
00:33:06,231 --> 00:33:08,720
monkeys were fucking monkeys,
right?

785
00:33:08,870 --> 00:33:09,703
We want to think we're better than that.
And Donald Trump right now is the big 

786
00:33:13,131 --> 00:33:13,930
Alpha Monkey.

787
00:33:13,930 --> 00:33:14,763
So okay,
so let's talk about the Alpha part 

788
00:33:16,151 --> 00:33:18,310
because I definitely think that's part 
of it.

789
00:33:18,340 --> 00:33:23,020
And he just is up.
They're exerting his alpha male is.

790
00:33:23,021 --> 00:33:25,780
And the rest of these guys simply aren't
Alpha males.

791
00:33:25,960 --> 00:33:29,770
So you can take a Marco Rubio who even 
though I disagree with on most things,

792
00:33:29,771 --> 00:33:30,604
I think he's probably a decent human 
being and he's in the right line of 

793
00:33:33,131 --> 00:33:33,964
work.
He's actually looked kind of human now 

794
00:33:35,621 --> 00:33:38,740
that he's realized he's over.
He's looking kind of human as opposed to

795
00:33:38,741 --> 00:33:40,330
the robot that we've been seeing up 
there.

796
00:33:40,540 --> 00:33:42,370
But you look at him,
that's certainly not an Alpha male.

797
00:33:42,371 --> 00:33:46,970
You look at a Ted Cruz,
just creepy car salesman,

798
00:33:47,680 --> 00:33:48,700
you know,
the rest of them.

799
00:33:48,730 --> 00:33:52,200
Ben Carson basically asleep.
So you know like.

800
00:33:52,600 --> 00:33:53,433
So is that really part of it that we 
really are just looking for somebody to 

801
00:33:57,161 --> 00:34:01,900
just get that feeling from us and it's 
like now I'll follow you

802
00:34:02,030 --> 00:34:04,000
and survive.
It is,

803
00:34:04,001 --> 00:34:06,680
it's definitely a vibe.
It's all unconscious.

804
00:34:06,681 --> 00:34:08,480
Ninety percent of communication you.
I mean,

805
00:34:08,481 --> 00:34:09,314
you know this,
right?

806
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:11,180
Anybody is ever dated,
you know,

807
00:34:11,181 --> 00:34:14,240
if you're across from a woman,
well man,

808
00:34:14,270 --> 00:34:15,350
you know,
whatever the case is,

809
00:34:15,640 --> 00:34:17,450
you know the person's like this looking 
at their phone,

810
00:34:17,540 --> 00:34:18,740
that's a vibe.
Right?

811
00:34:19,050 --> 00:34:21,140
Every week.
And we go based on vibes.

812
00:34:21,141 --> 00:34:21,974
But we as human beings want to believe 
that we're logical and that we make 

813
00:34:25,851 --> 00:34:26,684
conclusions based on what we.
We look at the evidence and we have all 

814
00:34:29,001 --> 00:34:31,220
this information and stuff.
We don't know.

815
00:34:31,221 --> 00:34:34,310
We don't have all the information that 
the media lies about things.

816
00:34:34,311 --> 00:34:37,460
The government lies about things.
We have no idea.

817
00:34:37,490 --> 00:34:39,080
The Federal Reserve has never been 
audited.

818
00:34:39,290 --> 00:34:43,400
We have no idea about anything.
And that's scary.

819
00:34:43,550 --> 00:34:47,240
It's scary to think that I'm just a 
regular schmuck who knows nothing.

820
00:34:47,600 --> 00:34:48,470
It has no control.

821
00:34:48,500 --> 00:34:50,750
But that's where the growth mindset 
comes in.

822
00:34:50,990 --> 00:34:52,850
I'm sort of like,
so people are always like,

823
00:34:52,851 --> 00:34:53,684
oh yeah,
you're probably there should probably 

824
00:34:54,411 --> 00:34:55,040
that.
I'm like,

825
00:34:55,040 --> 00:34:55,960
man,
if you know,

826
00:34:55,970 --> 00:34:59,120
we have met in real life,
I'm pretty mellow in real life because I

827
00:34:59,121 --> 00:35:02,000
realized like I found a fucking control 
over shit man.

828
00:35:02,010 --> 00:35:04,730
Like I have control much more measured 
here.

829
00:35:04,830 --> 00:35:06,930
You on twitter.
I didn't know what I was walking into.

830
00:35:07,620 --> 00:35:12,620
I have a little bit of control over how 
I feel and what I think that's about it.

831
00:35:12,621 --> 00:35:14,600
The rest of the world is sort of out of 
my control.

832
00:35:14,601 --> 00:35:18,830
So we talked about this pre show,
you know your life is your life.

833
00:35:18,831 --> 00:35:21,020
People think Obama's going to save them 
or ruined them.

834
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:23,960
People think that sanders is going to 
save them or unum.

835
00:35:24,170 --> 00:35:25,800
People think that Hillary is going to 
ruin the life.

836
00:35:25,940 --> 00:35:26,900
The same with trump.

837
00:35:27,380 --> 00:35:28,213
Why?
Why is trump going to ruin your life or 

838
00:35:29,901 --> 00:35:33,140
make your life and that isn't even 
really a healthy way to go about it.

839
00:35:33,141 --> 00:35:33,974
So people feel ms dot saver though.
But back to the original point is that 

840
00:35:37,620 --> 00:35:38,850
yeah,
he's got that vibe.

841
00:35:38,851 --> 00:35:41,640
He's got that swagger.
He's got watch them work and audience,

842
00:35:41,641 --> 00:35:42,474
right?
I always tell people turn off and stand 

843
00:35:44,121 --> 00:35:45,380
up half the day.
Oh,

844
00:35:45,560 --> 00:35:48,900
I said this and Obama is a Muslim.
And trump's,

845
00:35:48,930 --> 00:35:50,130
oh,
I didn't say he said it.

846
00:35:50,250 --> 00:35:51,083
Oh well I'll repeat what he said.
Well don't you dare say that I said 

847
00:35:53,281 --> 00:35:55,170
Obama's a Muslim.
I just.

848
00:35:55,190 --> 00:35:56,820
Or with the Ted Cruz is a pussy.
Well,

849
00:35:56,860 --> 00:35:58,290
I didn't say it but.
Oh,

850
00:35:58,291 --> 00:36:00,390
you didn't hear what he said.
Oh well that guy said,

851
00:36:00,391 --> 00:36:02,280
ted Cruz is a pussy.
But come on,

852
00:36:02,281 --> 00:36:04,140
I would never say that I'm running for 
president.

853
00:36:04,141 --> 00:36:05,410
I mean that's good shit man.

854
00:36:06,540 --> 00:36:07,373
So that's the.
That's the interesting thing here 

855
00:36:08,731 --> 00:36:09,564
because I want people to say whatever 
they want and we all know it's bullshit 

856
00:36:11,761 --> 00:36:13,140
and they go to Congress and they said,
Oh,

857
00:36:13,141 --> 00:36:13,974
the gentlemen from blog and it's like we
know you all hate each other and you're 

858
00:36:16,051 --> 00:36:19,530
all making side deals and all that.
So unmasking that is all good and that's

859
00:36:19,531 --> 00:36:22,380
the part of the trump thing.
The train that I can get on.

860
00:36:22,381 --> 00:36:25,680
So maybe there will be some good.
The other part I can't get there.

861
00:36:25,681 --> 00:36:28,110
The part about the policy stuff and what
he really believes,

862
00:36:28,230 --> 00:36:29,063
and I get what you're saying.
You're basically saying that stuff 

863
00:36:30,511 --> 00:36:31,344
doesn't matter because there's.
Because Shit's going to go down either 

864
00:36:33,391 --> 00:36:35,070
way.
I just can't get there on that,

865
00:36:35,071 --> 00:36:35,904
but I do.
I accept your premise as to why other 

866
00:36:37,621 --> 00:36:40,140
people can get their.
Trump has politically.

867
00:36:40,141 --> 00:36:45,141
If I had to guess politically centrust,
I would put him to the right of Obama,

868
00:36:47,010 --> 00:36:49,230
but to the left of everybody else 
running,

869
00:36:49,320 --> 00:36:50,153
which is why it all cracks me up,
that everybody on the left is scared 

870
00:36:53,401 --> 00:36:54,300
shitless to trump.

871
00:36:54,600 --> 00:36:56,820
Trump is actually,
he's a Rockefeller Liberal,

872
00:36:56,821 --> 00:36:57,654
New York liberal,
but he does want to do something about 

873
00:36:59,011 --> 00:37:00,040
immigration.
He's.

874
00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:04,830
He's raised a discussion that,
and I've traveled in the Middle East,

875
00:37:04,831 --> 00:37:08,100
I've met Muslims.
There's more to it than America knows.

876
00:37:08,101 --> 00:37:08,934
We don't know the full story on Muslims,
but we do know that isis is sending 

877
00:37:13,411 --> 00:37:15,120
people in as,
as refugees.

878
00:37:15,270 --> 00:37:16,103
I know that I went to Budapest,
Hungary and I saw the refugees and they 

879
00:37:19,041 --> 00:37:19,874
look like you and me and people like 
this and way younger there's 70 percent 

880
00:37:23,071 --> 00:37:27,960
men and if you take in 70 percent men,
you don't have enough women,

881
00:37:28,350 --> 00:37:30,120
right?
Because they're mostly heterosexual.

882
00:37:30,510 --> 00:37:33,990
You now have gender disbalance.
How are they going to get late?

883
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,030
What's going to happen?
Are they going to get violent?

884
00:37:36,670 --> 00:37:39,900
These are things that reasonable people 
should be able to ask,

885
00:37:40,080 --> 00:37:42,720
but if you even asked that question,
you're done.

886
00:37:43,080 --> 00:37:44,400
So you might as well just say,
fuck it.

887
00:37:44,790 --> 00:37:45,600
Fuck it.
Don't let,

888
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:47,760
don't let any of them in there because 
people are going to say,

889
00:37:47,761 --> 00:37:48,690
you're done anyway.
Right?

890
00:37:48,930 --> 00:37:49,860
So if I just said,
well,

891
00:37:49,861 --> 00:37:50,610
you know,
I was in,

892
00:37:50,610 --> 00:37:52,380
I went to Hungary.
I went to the train stations,

893
00:37:52,381 --> 00:37:54,600
I investigated it for myself,
I did reporting on it.

894
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:57,180
They're all men,
they're all able bodied.

895
00:37:57,181 --> 00:37:58,014
They're all prime fighting age.
Why are they leaving the women back 

896
00:37:59,791 --> 00:38:01,500
home?
What is really going on?

897
00:38:01,650 --> 00:38:02,483
Well,
if you say that your persona non grata 

898
00:38:04,410 --> 00:38:05,160
anyway.
Right.

899
00:38:05,160 --> 00:38:05,993
So that's why you look.
Even if you look at the pictures coming 

900
00:38:07,801 --> 00:38:11,730
out where the migrants are crossing into
Greece and they're crossing into Germany

901
00:38:11,731 --> 00:38:14,070
and wherever else they're going.
It's all men.

902
00:38:14,071 --> 00:38:15,960
It's all men in their twenties and 
thirties,

903
00:38:16,410 --> 00:38:17,400
right?
One hundred percent,

904
00:38:17,610 --> 00:38:18,443
but a huge percentage of it,
and this is where I as a liberal had 

905
00:38:20,731 --> 00:38:21,564
been painted into a corner here for the 
eight months that I've been doing this 

906
00:38:23,851 --> 00:38:24,480
show.

907
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:25,313
I've tried to talk about the difference 
between ideas and people and doctrine 

908
00:38:28,891 --> 00:38:29,724
versus the average person that may or 
may not be religious and probably isn't 

909
00:38:32,601 --> 00:38:34,650
a impressing anyone and doesn't want to 
blow anything up.

910
00:38:35,170 --> 00:38:36,003
But I've been left basically with my 10 
guys on the left and the whole 

911
00:38:39,131 --> 00:38:42,610
conversation has been handed to trump.
So he's just taking the meat,

912
00:38:42,611 --> 00:38:44,650
right?
He's just taking the red meat on this.

913
00:38:44,690 --> 00:38:45,523
Well,
because here's what I learned to and 

914
00:38:46,661 --> 00:38:47,494
that's why I'm kind of a little bit 
while on twitter as I realized that if 

915
00:38:51,101 --> 00:38:52,600
you.
If people ask me,

916
00:38:52,601 --> 00:38:53,530
Mike,
what do you really believe?

917
00:38:53,531 --> 00:38:54,341
Author world,
I would say,

918
00:38:54,341 --> 00:38:56,020
well,
I think that generally speaking,

919
00:38:56,950 --> 00:38:57,783
women enjoy being more feminine and more
supportive role of a man who's more 

920
00:39:00,941 --> 00:39:01,774
dominant,
but if you want to be a woman and you 

921
00:39:03,041 --> 00:39:03,874
want to be a lawyer or a CEO,
I don't think anybody should stop you 

922
00:39:06,580 --> 00:39:10,540
and I think you should be careful not to
tell women what they have to do.

923
00:39:10,840 --> 00:39:14,230
Those pretty boring shit.
Basic Shit.

924
00:39:14,500 --> 00:39:15,333
But if you put that online,
will you contribute to a culture of 

925
00:39:17,621 --> 00:39:19,940
internalized misogyny?
That Turkey?

926
00:39:19,960 --> 00:39:20,341
Yeah,
yeah,

927
00:39:20,341 --> 00:39:21,670
yeah.
So you can't even say that,

928
00:39:21,671 --> 00:39:23,110
so you might as well say,
fuck it,

929
00:39:23,500 --> 00:39:25,170
I'm the best.
Sex is rough,

930
00:39:25,180 --> 00:39:26,013
sex and women are crazy and they have 
wild sexual fantasies and everything 

931
00:39:28,950 --> 00:39:29,783
because they're gonna come after you and
so you're doing the trump tactic 

932
00:39:31,721 --> 00:39:34,090
yourself and you're admitting it because
basically you're saying,

933
00:39:34,240 --> 00:39:35,073
I'm pretty moderate guy.
If that women can do whatever they want 

934
00:39:37,481 --> 00:39:38,950
to do,
in my view,

935
00:39:38,951 --> 00:39:39,784
maybe they're better off at home,
but they can do whatever they want to 

936
00:39:41,801 --> 00:39:43,240
do,
but when you're online,

937
00:39:43,241 --> 00:39:44,074
you're staking out this stuff because 
you just want to keep rattling the cage 

938
00:39:46,760 --> 00:39:48,250
and they're gonna come after you.
Anyway,

939
00:39:48,251 --> 00:39:51,250
that's the thing is feelings versus 
facts.

940
00:39:51,400 --> 00:39:54,250
People don't sit down and just have a 
rational conversation.

941
00:39:54,250 --> 00:39:55,510
Well,
what do you really think about this?

942
00:39:55,511 --> 00:39:56,344
You know,
people have written about me before 

943
00:39:57,281 --> 00:39:57,911
rentable.
My tweets.

944
00:39:57,911 --> 00:39:58,990
Nobody's ever said,
hey,

945
00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:02,410
I read this tweet where he told the guy 
to go kill himself.

946
00:40:02,440 --> 00:40:04,390
What did you really mean?
Well,

947
00:40:04,510 --> 00:40:05,343
the guy told him to kill himself,
had actually tried to kill his ex 

948
00:40:08,561 --> 00:40:12,250
girlfriend had was at a rehab and burned
with cigarettes,

949
00:40:12,520 --> 00:40:14,020
were real bad guy.
Right?

950
00:40:14,021 --> 00:40:16,180
And he was a troll who wasn't really 
going to kill himself.

951
00:40:16,181 --> 00:40:18,400
He was doing the whole,
I'm having a meltdown,

952
00:40:18,401 --> 00:40:19,234
therefore I'm mentally ill because 
that's what you do when you do bad 

953
00:40:20,531 --> 00:40:21,340
things now,
right?

954
00:40:21,340 --> 00:40:23,140
You gotTa Rehab your claim mental 
illness,

955
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:24,340
but nobody says,
Hey,

956
00:40:24,341 --> 00:40:26,410
what's the context man?
What's the backstory?

957
00:40:26,560 --> 00:40:29,710
So you realize,
well you might as well be a maniac.

958
00:40:29,980 --> 00:40:32,560
You put on a good show.
The people love it.

959
00:40:32,860 --> 00:40:33,850
So when trump.

960
00:40:34,120 --> 00:40:34,953
I didn't know about trump.
That's the funny thing and that's 

961
00:40:36,881 --> 00:40:37,714
probably why I saw early on why he was 
going to do so well as I watched one 

962
00:40:41,201 --> 00:40:43,770
season of the apprentice when I was in 
law school 10 years ago,

963
00:40:43,840 --> 00:40:44,673
right?
So I didn't really know anything about 

964
00:40:46,061 --> 00:40:47,460
trump and I looked at what he didn't 
like him.

965
00:40:47,950 --> 00:40:52,480
He's just doing what I do.
But on a scale that is way bigger than I

966
00:40:52,481 --> 00:40:54,640
do and what you're doing is you realize 
that,

967
00:40:54,641 --> 00:40:56,230
okay,
what do people love?

968
00:40:56,470 --> 00:40:57,303
Men,
women,

969
00:40:57,340 --> 00:40:59,290
drama.
People love drama.

970
00:40:59,590 --> 00:41:02,710
People love conflict.
Conflict is attention.

971
00:41:03,280 --> 00:41:04,390
Negative attention.
Pause.

972
00:41:04,460 --> 00:41:07,360
Cause cause you can take a hater and 
turn that into a lover,

973
00:41:07,750 --> 00:41:10,740
but you can't turn.
People don't know about you on A.

974
00:41:11,500 --> 00:41:13,750
Yeah.
So you want to get maximum attention?

975
00:41:13,840 --> 00:41:14,860
Yeah.
You know,

976
00:41:15,250 --> 00:41:16,083
I don't watch any reality shows.
I've maybe watched them five minutes of 

977
00:41:19,301 --> 00:41:20,290
survivor ever.

978
00:41:20,290 --> 00:41:22,090
I never watched American idol or any of 
that stuff.

979
00:41:22,091 --> 00:41:26,620
The only reality show that I've watched 
is the celebrity apprentice.

980
00:41:26,920 --> 00:41:28,690
So this was,
you know,

981
00:41:28,810 --> 00:41:31,000
five years ago before he was running for
president.

982
00:41:31,150 --> 00:41:32,950
So that,
I guess says it right there,

983
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:33,793
there is something about him.
You're not going to convince me to vote 

984
00:41:36,260 --> 00:41:37,093
for him by the end of this,
but that I can understand the logic of 

985
00:41:39,681 --> 00:41:40,390
it.
Um,

986
00:41:40,390 --> 00:41:41,540
and I thought also that,
you know,

987
00:41:41,541 --> 00:41:42,374
having someone on that's a trump 
supporter would be interesting because 

988
00:41:44,121 --> 00:41:45,770
everyone's just screaming at each other.
Right.

989
00:41:45,830 --> 00:41:46,663
So we should match the,
the media would love us to be sitting 

990
00:41:48,441 --> 00:41:49,820
here screaming at each other.
That would,

991
00:41:49,870 --> 00:41:51,080
that would help the narrative,
right?

992
00:41:51,470 --> 00:41:52,850
Yeah.
It would help the narrative.

993
00:41:52,851 --> 00:41:53,710
You know,
I,

994
00:41:53,850 --> 00:41:56,030
I would get a lot of interview requests 
I used to.

995
00:41:56,090 --> 00:41:56,923
They stopped calling me,
they don't email anymore because they 

996
00:41:58,161 --> 00:41:58,841
talked to me like,
well,

997
00:41:58,841 --> 00:41:59,690
wait a minute,
you know,

998
00:41:59,810 --> 00:42:01,470
they want me to play pro wrestling 
characters.

999
00:42:01,470 --> 00:42:02,303
This is what the media wants and and 
that's why I do a little bit online 

1000
00:42:04,941 --> 00:42:06,110
because I realized like,
okay,

1001
00:42:06,470 --> 00:42:08,150
I grew up watching ads,
pro wrestling.

1002
00:42:08,390 --> 00:42:10,130
I'm just to heal.
I'm the bad guy.

1003
00:42:10,230 --> 00:42:11,870
Right.
Might as well be ric flair,

1004
00:42:11,960 --> 00:42:13,530
the million dollar man,
you know,

1005
00:42:13,580 --> 00:42:16,390
I might as well just because they're 
going to make me one anywhere.

1006
00:42:16,460 --> 00:42:19,850
As Mike Tyson said,
I could speak eloquently,

1007
00:42:20,090 --> 00:42:21,860
but you're going to call me a fucking 
rapist anyway,

1008
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:23,450
so might as well.
Right.

1009
00:42:23,451 --> 00:42:25,730
Just be crazy for a second.
Jake,

1010
00:42:25,731 --> 00:42:27,390
the snake Roberts was my favorite 
restaurant.

1011
00:42:27,890 --> 00:42:30,260
He was a good guy,
but it didn't.

1012
00:42:30,261 --> 00:42:32,600
Went Back.
Didn't have many friends on his side.

1013
00:42:32,660 --> 00:42:34,250
So I feel like maybe that was the right 
guy for me.

1014
00:42:34,490 --> 00:42:35,510
Yeah,
exactly.

1015
00:42:35,860 --> 00:42:37,220
But think about it,
right?

1016
00:42:37,880 --> 00:42:39,380
Think about trump.
You.

1017
00:42:39,470 --> 00:42:41,630
How hard is immediate game,
right?

1018
00:42:41,930 --> 00:42:42,890
How hard is.
Well,

1019
00:42:42,891 --> 00:42:44,270
I guess if you're trump,
it's not that hard.

1020
00:42:44,300 --> 00:42:44,631
He's.
Well,

1021
00:42:44,631 --> 00:42:45,170
that's,
that's,

1022
00:42:45,170 --> 00:42:46,130
that's what I'm saying.
Yeah.

1023
00:42:46,280 --> 00:42:47,870
So you have all these people in the 
media,

1024
00:42:48,380 --> 00:42:49,700
you know,
you have a personal brand.

1025
00:42:49,701 --> 00:42:51,700
I have a personal brand,
but you'll see some guy,

1026
00:42:51,730 --> 00:42:52,563
you know the job with the Washington 
Post and say trump doesn't know what 

1027
00:42:54,771 --> 00:42:55,610
he's doing.
He's an idiot.

1028
00:42:55,790 --> 00:42:57,350
I'll go on the guy's twitter account and
I'm like,

1029
00:42:57,351 --> 00:42:58,880
dude,
you're right at the Washington Post,

1030
00:42:58,881 --> 00:42:59,714
and he was like 1500 followers.
Like I have 31 and it's all organic 

1031
00:43:03,111 --> 00:43:04,100
following,
you know,

1032
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:07,010
I sell more books than these guys and 
everything because I'm real.

1033
00:43:07,310 --> 00:43:10,250
I know who does what because you can 
look at Amazon sales ranks and I'm like,

1034
00:43:11,480 --> 00:43:13,700
you don't get it.
The media game is hard.

1035
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:14,833
Trump is winning it.
So maybe instead of saying list guys 

1036
00:43:16,880 --> 00:43:18,830
evil,
why don't you just take a step back,

1037
00:43:19,100 --> 00:43:20,840
breathe and say,
well what is he doing?

1038
00:43:21,530 --> 00:43:23,000
And then say,
well why is he doing it?

1039
00:43:23,030 --> 00:43:23,863
So That's interesting because I've 
noticed in the last few days since the 

1040
00:43:26,091 --> 00:43:29,720
rally in Chicago that got canceled that 
the media definitely,

1041
00:43:29,721 --> 00:43:32,210
I hate using the phrase of the media is 
it's this monolith,

1042
00:43:32,480 --> 00:43:35,780
but the mainstream media and even a lot 
of the online stuff,

1043
00:43:35,810 --> 00:43:39,920
they've really doubled down now on trump
is evil and all that stuff.

1044
00:43:39,950 --> 00:43:40,783
Now again,
I started this show by giving a litany 

1045
00:43:42,201 --> 00:43:43,940
of reasons why I'm not voting for this 
guy.

1046
00:43:44,260 --> 00:43:45,093
Um,
but I think that every time buzzfeed 

1047
00:43:47,061 --> 00:43:50,960
puts out an article saying why he's evil
or every time political does it or,

1048
00:43:51,020 --> 00:43:51,853
or,
and especially anything that's on the 

1049
00:43:52,431 --> 00:43:53,300
left,
right?

1050
00:43:53,301 --> 00:43:54,134
So New York magazine or then I think 
they're just strengthening him and they 

1051
00:43:56,720 --> 00:43:57,770
would,
I don't understand is,

1052
00:43:57,771 --> 00:43:58,604
do you guys not understand psych 101?
Did none of you go to college because 

1053
00:44:01,500 --> 00:44:04,310
all you're doing is making him stronger 
case to everybody?

1054
00:44:04,940 --> 00:44:07,220
Most of them don't understand it,
but some of them do,

1055
00:44:07,550 --> 00:44:09,710
but ultimately we're all in a big media 
matrix.

1056
00:44:09,800 --> 00:44:10,633
Okay,
I'll uncover media hoax and then the 

1057
00:44:13,160 --> 00:44:14,000
next day I'll be like,
oh yeah,

1058
00:44:14,001 --> 00:44:17,180
I wrote this article and the whatever 
that I just said yesterday is a piece of

1059
00:44:17,181 --> 00:44:18,320
shit,
you know,

1060
00:44:18,321 --> 00:44:19,154
now I'm saying,
well that's an interesting story on 

1061
00:44:21,021 --> 00:44:21,854
this.
So we're all kind of caught in the 

1062
00:44:22,761 --> 00:44:23,594
Matrix and in that regard,
the savvy people know that they are 

1063
00:44:27,111 --> 00:44:29,480
ultimately building his brand,
but they're getting clicks,

1064
00:44:29,481 --> 00:44:30,920
but they're,
they're getting views.

1065
00:44:31,780 --> 00:44:34,330
We just all deserved the bullshit that 
at the end of the day,

1066
00:44:34,331 --> 00:44:36,070
right,
because everything,

1067
00:44:36,340 --> 00:44:39,580
I know for a fact that if we did this 
show a little bit differently,

1068
00:44:39,581 --> 00:44:41,950
so you know,
in the youtube game for example,

1069
00:44:41,951 --> 00:44:44,050
if we titled things a little 
differently,

1070
00:44:44,230 --> 00:44:45,063
we could double our clicks like that and
I've had many meetings with my guys and 

1071
00:44:47,591 --> 00:44:48,670
I'm just like,
I'm not going to do it.

1072
00:44:48,671 --> 00:44:51,670
I just don't want to build something in 
that way,

1073
00:44:51,790 --> 00:44:52,623
but plenty of other people are so we all
deserve the crap that we're getting 

1074
00:44:56,591 --> 00:44:57,610
because we're building the crap.

1075
00:44:58,090 --> 00:44:58,923
Yeah.
I tried to have a debate with the guy 

1076
00:45:00,911 --> 00:45:01,744
once said we had a real civil talk just 
like we're talking now and that the 

1077
00:45:04,091 --> 00:45:07,000
youtube thing went on and he just was a 
and I thought,

1078
00:45:07,540 --> 00:45:11,110
are we going to scream at each other?
But that's what people want.

1079
00:45:11,580 --> 00:45:12,400
You know,
that is.

1080
00:45:12,400 --> 00:45:14,590
That is what most everybody screams at 
everybody.

1081
00:45:14,740 --> 00:45:16,210
Everybody online and she's saying,
well,

1082
00:45:16,211 --> 00:45:17,800
you're an Mri,
evil Mrs.

1083
00:45:17,830 --> 00:45:22,060
Men's rights activists evil or you evil 
as we are evil feminist or an evil that,

1084
00:45:22,720 --> 00:45:24,100
that yeah,
that's what people want.

1085
00:45:24,101 --> 00:45:25,330
But then it becomes,
you know,

1086
00:45:25,331 --> 00:45:28,810
you as an artist,
you have to find your own integrity.

1087
00:45:29,440 --> 00:45:32,320
And my integrity.
I think trump's integrity to us.

1088
00:45:32,470 --> 00:45:36,790
I ultimately have a very good message.
I wrap it up and drama,

1089
00:45:36,850 --> 00:45:40,810
conflict and all that other stuff,
but smart people see through it.

1090
00:45:41,170 --> 00:45:42,270
They can kind of say,
okay,

1091
00:45:42,271 --> 00:45:42,611
I,
you know,

1092
00:45:42,611 --> 00:45:43,840
I kind of see what's going on.

1093
00:45:43,840 --> 00:45:44,541
I get,
I see.

1094
00:45:44,541 --> 00:45:45,374
To the theatrical,
trump is somebody who cares a lot about 

1095
00:45:47,471 --> 00:45:50,710
America and he does what nobody else 
running does.

1096
00:45:50,740 --> 00:45:52,060
Okay.
We are Americans.

1097
00:45:52,061 --> 00:45:54,220
We have the right to have an identity as
a nation.

1098
00:45:54,400 --> 00:45:55,233
We have the right to have a culture.
We have the right to say you as an 

1099
00:45:58,181 --> 00:45:59,014
American,
I care more about you than I care about 

1100
00:46:00,671 --> 00:46:02,950
people in China,
Bangladesh,

1101
00:46:03,070 --> 00:46:04,690
Romania,
Nigeria,

1102
00:46:04,990 --> 00:46:07,810
nobody else is saying that.
And that's where nationalism comes in.

1103
00:46:07,811 --> 00:46:10,990
And that's another reason that he's 
doing well is it's this idea that,

1104
00:46:11,890 --> 00:46:13,030
yeah,
I'm an American.

1105
00:46:13,031 --> 00:46:14,740
You don't hear that much.
Now a lot of people,

1106
00:46:14,741 --> 00:46:18,310
even the sort of chattering class,
the so called intellectuals would say,

1107
00:46:18,490 --> 00:46:19,323
well,
nationalism is bad and you're part of a 

1108
00:46:20,351 --> 00:46:21,184
global society.
You think you're part of a global 

1109
00:46:23,051 --> 00:46:23,884
society,
but go travel somewhere and you'll find 

1110
00:46:25,241 --> 00:46:28,240
right away that they don't think you're 
part of a global society.

1111
00:46:28,320 --> 00:46:32,160
So is that why his slogan even make 
America great again?

1112
00:46:32,190 --> 00:46:34,140
First off,
everyone wants things to be great,

1113
00:46:34,141 --> 00:46:34,974
so that's good,
but also throwing the word again in 

1114
00:46:36,421 --> 00:46:38,730
their implies that we lost something 
great.

1115
00:46:38,940 --> 00:46:41,460
We're going to get that thing back.
Versus Bernie's,

1116
00:46:41,461 --> 00:46:42,294
which is a future to believe in.
So Bernie's not talking about getting a 

1117
00:46:46,051 --> 00:46:47,610
feeling back.
He's saying,

1118
00:46:47,611 --> 00:46:48,444
well,
something out there is pretty good at 

1119
00:46:50,391 --> 00:46:52,080
trump's gone.
We lost some shit.

1120
00:46:52,081 --> 00:46:52,914
So it really,
it's just about which part of the brain 

1121
00:46:54,541 --> 00:46:55,374
these guys are

1122
00:46:55,600 --> 00:46:59,350
todd onto?
Trump packs more information in a slogan

1123
00:46:59,351 --> 00:47:02,920
or a tweet than anybody else does.
He jams in Atlanta is worse.

1124
00:47:02,921 --> 00:47:04,630
So yeah,
make America great again.

1125
00:47:04,870 --> 00:47:07,630
If you're an advertising or marketing 
that's aspirational,

1126
00:47:08,020 --> 00:47:08,853
you know that if you're in marketing,
you want an app to be an aspirational 

1127
00:47:12,041 --> 00:47:14,080
good.
Trump is an aspirational.

1128
00:47:14,081 --> 00:47:14,914
This is all.
This is what pisses me off fucking 

1129
00:47:16,091 --> 00:47:16,924
marketing.
How can all these people who claim they 

1130
00:47:18,551 --> 00:47:20,920
know marketing not just sit and say,
okay,

1131
00:47:20,921 --> 00:47:24,550
trump is running an ad campaign.
Trump is an aspirational good.

1132
00:47:25,060 --> 00:47:26,860
Trump is saying make America great 
again.

1133
00:47:26,890 --> 00:47:27,723
That's an aspirational slogan and tying 
on nationalistic feelings like America 

1134
00:47:32,200 --> 00:47:36,220
and make is a very sort of can do word.
Americans have a can do attitude.

1135
00:47:36,280 --> 00:47:37,410
I mean the guy who wrote a book about 
it,

1136
00:47:37,420 --> 00:47:39,100
right?
He's doing what's in his book,

1137
00:47:39,130 --> 00:47:40,900
right?
So this stuff used to sort of,

1138
00:47:40,930 --> 00:47:41,763
you know,
that's where I have to use the girl 

1139
00:47:42,461 --> 00:47:43,840
mindset was like maddening.

1140
00:47:44,110 --> 00:47:44,880
I'm like,
don't you,

1141
00:47:44,880 --> 00:47:48,370
you aren't intelligent people.
You can't just analyze this.

1142
00:47:48,371 --> 00:47:49,204
But again,
that's because that's my own weakness 

1143
00:47:51,011 --> 00:47:53,440
and thinking that people are logical.
If you're logical,

1144
00:47:53,441 --> 00:47:54,670
you would just sit down and say,
okay,

1145
00:47:54,671 --> 00:47:56,950
here's what trump does.
You read his tweets.

1146
00:47:57,220 --> 00:47:59,710
Many people have said that I'm the 
greatest man in the world.

1147
00:47:59,820 --> 00:48:00,700
What?
What has he done there?

1148
00:48:01,030 --> 00:48:02,020
Well,
social proof.

1149
00:48:02,140 --> 00:48:04,270
Many people,
because we are a monkey's wealth,

1150
00:48:04,271 --> 00:48:05,104
many people think it must be true.
He's not bragging because he's not 

1151
00:48:08,171 --> 00:48:10,420
saying that that's what many people are 
saying,

1152
00:48:10,720 --> 00:48:14,170
so a lot of times you could just sit 
down and look at trump's tweets,

1153
00:48:14,410 --> 00:48:15,243
read them,
and really see that this guy uses 

1154
00:48:16,751 --> 00:48:18,100
language wall,
so they go,

1155
00:48:18,101 --> 00:48:19,300
is an idiot.
He's a buffoon.

1156
00:48:19,480 --> 00:48:20,201
And I said,
no,

1157
00:48:20,201 --> 00:48:20,560
no,
no,

1158
00:48:20,560 --> 00:48:24,910
you're the fucking buffoon because I can
explain it just very logically.

1159
00:48:25,290 --> 00:48:26,590
Every he uses social proof.

1160
00:48:26,590 --> 00:48:28,560
He uses cognitive biases.
You know,

1161
00:48:28,570 --> 00:48:31,480
in college you learn the logical 
fallacies to make good arguments.

1162
00:48:31,930 --> 00:48:32,763
Well,
what if you're a soft fist and you take 

1163
00:48:34,091 --> 00:48:37,950
the logical fallacies to trick people to
be a Sophos,

1164
00:48:38,110 --> 00:48:39,820
right?
Maybe you're not dumb.

1165
00:48:39,970 --> 00:48:44,350
Maybe you're the smart guy because the 
reason that you learn to analyze logical

1166
00:48:44,351 --> 00:48:48,400
fallacies is because we are lazy 
thinkers and fallacies.

1167
00:48:48,401 --> 00:48:50,830
Work is just a good way of manipulating.
Yeah.

1168
00:48:51,070 --> 00:48:52,300
So maybe you know,
people are like,

1169
00:48:52,301 --> 00:48:54,260
Oh,
if you use a logical fallacy,

1170
00:48:54,261 --> 00:48:57,460
you're stupid maybe.
But if you're using a logical fallacy,

1171
00:48:57,470 --> 00:48:59,260
you get people to draw.
Fall San Francisco.

1172
00:48:59,530 --> 00:49:01,870
Marco Rubio's send a foam party.
Well,

1173
00:49:02,410 --> 00:49:04,870
I haven't said.
I haven't said anything,

1174
00:49:05,080 --> 00:49:07,420
but Marco Rubio said that he was in a 
foam party.

1175
00:49:07,630 --> 00:49:09,850
Well,
I'm now using the fallacy of getting you

1176
00:49:09,851 --> 00:49:13,000
to draw false inference.
That must've been some gay thing.

1177
00:49:13,001 --> 00:49:15,010
And is he really in the closet?
Well,

1178
00:49:15,011 --> 00:49:17,980
I didn't say that right.
You said it.

1179
00:49:18,030 --> 00:49:18,541
Yeah,
yeah,

1180
00:49:18,541 --> 00:49:19,111
yeah.
I mean,

1181
00:49:19,111 --> 00:49:20,850
I get it.
I fully get what you're saying.

1182
00:49:20,851 --> 00:49:25,140
It's such a dangerous slippery slope and
some people are going to play the game.

1183
00:49:25,260 --> 00:49:26,093
So I guess that's what it is.
People are angry at him because he's 

1184
00:49:27,241 --> 00:49:28,074
playing the game at a higher level.
So I tweeted a day or two ago and it's 

1185
00:49:31,380 --> 00:49:32,040
taking off,
right?

1186
00:49:32,040 --> 00:49:35,430
The second thing about it was three 
things and it was one,

1187
00:49:35,490 --> 00:49:36,960
uh,
I don't support trump.

1188
00:49:37,680 --> 00:49:42,030
I do believe in free speech.
If you use your free speech to take away

1189
00:49:42,031 --> 00:49:44,670
someone else's,
then one day they will come for you.

1190
00:49:44,850 --> 00:49:45,683
And I think that really sums up what's 
going on here because if you look at 

1191
00:49:47,851 --> 00:49:49,350
what happened at the rally the other 
night,

1192
00:49:49,590 --> 00:49:53,040
it wasn't the government that came in.
So it wasn't a first amendment issue.

1193
00:49:53,041 --> 00:49:55,530
The government didn't say,
you're not allowed to say this,

1194
00:49:55,800 --> 00:49:56,633
but if we start getting to a place,
and I'm not saying this is exactly what 

1195
00:49:59,701 --> 00:50:00,534
happened that night because it's a 
little unclear who started what and 

1196
00:50:01,951 --> 00:50:02,784
whatever,
but if we get to a place where everyone 

1197
00:50:04,321 --> 00:50:08,370
is just using their free speech to shout
down everybody else,

1198
00:50:08,760 --> 00:50:09,593
well then we don't have free speech and 
it has nothing to do with the 

1199
00:50:11,281 --> 00:50:11,970
government.

1200
00:50:11,970 --> 00:50:12,803
So there's.
There's a huge free speech play here 

1201
00:50:13,771 --> 00:50:14,410
too,
right?

1202
00:50:14,410 --> 00:50:16,210
Yeah.
Well they call it the heckler's veto.

1203
00:50:16,510 --> 00:50:18,940
You're going to let one guy scream 
everybody else down.

1204
00:50:19,090 --> 00:50:19,923
So then whoever has the biggest heckler 
is the person who controls the debate 

1205
00:50:23,320 --> 00:50:24,153
and then yeah,
the broader point you make is perfect 

1206
00:50:25,721 --> 00:50:26,554
because not to plug my documentary that 
we're doing and that we want to talk to 

1207
00:50:29,271 --> 00:50:29,860
you,
but I'll go away.

1208
00:50:29,860 --> 00:50:30,693
That's pissed off a lot of my guys 
because it's called silenced our war on 

1209
00:50:34,561 --> 00:50:36,320
free speech and they go,
no,

1210
00:50:36,321 --> 00:50:38,990
it's not.
Our war is a war and we want to think,

1211
00:50:38,991 --> 00:50:40,460
well,
there's a war on all of us.

1212
00:50:40,461 --> 00:50:41,294
Free thinkers and everything,
but it isn't the government censoring 

1213
00:50:43,131 --> 00:50:44,720
us.
We're fucking doing it to each other.

1214
00:50:44,870 --> 00:50:47,030
I'm afraid if I say the wrong thing to 
you,

1215
00:50:47,180 --> 00:50:48,740
you're going to think I'm a shitty 
person.

1216
00:50:48,920 --> 00:50:51,200
You're afraid that if you post the wrong
thing on twitter,

1217
00:50:51,500 --> 00:50:54,020
you're going to get fired from your job 
or people are gonna come after you.

1218
00:50:54,020 --> 00:50:56,120
They're going to call your advertised as
one long thing.

1219
00:50:56,780 --> 00:50:59,690
So we're all kind of censoring each 
other were really,

1220
00:51:00,050 --> 00:51:01,010
why don't we just say,
well,

1221
00:51:01,011 --> 00:51:01,880
you know,
you said that.

1222
00:51:01,881 --> 00:51:02,930
What do you really mean it?
Oh,

1223
00:51:02,931 --> 00:51:05,450
you're a trump supporter.
Will why your trump supporter?

1224
00:51:05,750 --> 00:51:07,040
Well,
I'm a maybe.

1225
00:51:07,070 --> 00:51:08,030
Maybe if somebody would say,
well,

1226
00:51:08,031 --> 00:51:08,864
I'm a trump supporter because I believe 
America has the right to exist as a 

1227
00:51:11,661 --> 00:51:12,530
nation.
Okay,

1228
00:51:12,830 --> 00:51:13,700
well,
I don't know.

1229
00:51:13,730 --> 00:51:14,380
What do you mean?
Did it.

1230
00:51:14,380 --> 00:51:15,740
Did it right?
You just talk.

1231
00:51:15,800 --> 00:51:16,633
That's what people should do.
You listen to one another and right now 

1232
00:51:19,761 --> 00:51:21,510
we don't.
We're all declaring war on each other.

1233
00:51:21,511 --> 00:51:22,430
Right?
So That's interesting.

1234
00:51:22,490 --> 00:51:23,323
But it goes to the people that are 
taking the higher road here or almost 

1235
00:51:28,281 --> 00:51:30,020
destined to lose then.
Right?

1236
00:51:30,021 --> 00:51:31,820
Because if you're taking the higher road
here and you're saying,

1237
00:51:31,821 --> 00:51:35,180
I'm going to respect your free speech,
I don't like what you say,

1238
00:51:35,181 --> 00:51:37,340
but I'm going to defend your right to 
say it.

1239
00:51:37,930 --> 00:51:38,763
If you take that road.
Well basically from everything you've 

1240
00:51:41,151 --> 00:51:41,984
said here,
there's going to be a huge swell of 

1241
00:51:43,041 --> 00:51:48,041
people that won't do that and thus will 
always win with the heckler's veto.

1242
00:51:48,651 --> 00:51:50,390
Right?
That that's where I see this all going.

1243
00:51:50,391 --> 00:51:51,490
That's why I've been talking to you.
They

1244
00:51:51,550 --> 00:51:54,300
were winning,
but now there's a massive counterculture

1245
00:51:54,570 --> 00:51:56,340
where people are saying,
you know,

1246
00:51:56,910 --> 00:51:59,010
me and Lauren,
the director of the silence,

1247
00:51:59,011 --> 00:52:00,210
we say,
we're going to make free speech.

1248
00:52:00,211 --> 00:52:00,920
Cool.
Again,

1249
00:52:00,920 --> 00:52:02,400
you know,
we don't have an agenda.

1250
00:52:02,850 --> 00:52:04,440
We just want people to know that,
you know,

1251
00:52:04,441 --> 00:52:05,274
it's cool to share your point of view.
It's cool to talk and more people are 

1252
00:52:08,041 --> 00:52:08,874
getting that.
If you look at whose profiles are being 

1253
00:52:10,531 --> 00:52:12,360
raised on twitter,
which is kind of,

1254
00:52:12,810 --> 00:52:13,643
twitter is where the future's headed.
That's why I love twitter and we could 

1255
00:52:16,141 --> 00:52:17,780
do a whole hour and just why I love 
twitter.

1256
00:52:18,090 --> 00:52:19,590
Twitter is the future.
The future is.

1257
00:52:19,650 --> 00:52:20,483
Even though the business is crumbling,
you mean the ideas behind because the 

1258
00:52:22,681 --> 00:52:25,860
people who are kind of out of,
I don't like the word thought leaders,

1259
00:52:25,861 --> 00:52:28,530
but hip smart tech savvy people.
Here's what they're thinking.

1260
00:52:28,750 --> 00:52:30,090
They're,
they like people like you.

1261
00:52:30,210 --> 00:52:33,120
They like people like Laura southern.
They're like people like Milo,

1262
00:52:33,290 --> 00:52:34,123
uh,
they like people like Gavin [inaudible] 

1263
00:52:34,641 --> 00:52:35,820
guys,
my profile is going.

1264
00:52:35,910 --> 00:52:38,280
So the people who are sort of pro free 
speech,

1265
00:52:38,430 --> 00:52:39,263
their profiles are growing and then 
there's a pushback against the 

1266
00:52:41,431 --> 00:52:42,264
regressive left.
So what had happened is we had given 

1267
00:52:44,311 --> 00:52:45,144
everybody the heckler's veto to call you
a homophobe or a racist and 

1268
00:52:48,780 --> 00:52:49,900
misogynistic,
transphobic.

1269
00:52:49,940 --> 00:52:52,500
We say one wrong thing and now you're 
realizing,

1270
00:52:53,130 --> 00:52:55,260
well,
that's shutting everybody speech down.

1271
00:52:55,440 --> 00:53:00,120
Now before we have the regressive left,
the sjws we had the moral majority.

1272
00:53:00,300 --> 00:53:03,570
We had tipper Gore trying to say,
you can't listen to it because you and I

1273
00:53:03,571 --> 00:53:03,991
were,
you know,

1274
00:53:03,991 --> 00:53:07,740
I don't want to say we're old,
handsome men are fucking old man.

1275
00:53:07,770 --> 00:53:09,780
Like ice tea,
body cow,

1276
00:53:09,810 --> 00:53:11,550
cop killer.
Oh my God.

1277
00:53:11,551 --> 00:53:12,660
You know,
he's inciting violence.

1278
00:53:12,661 --> 00:53:14,290
Uh,
I used to do in bed.

1279
00:53:14,310 --> 00:53:15,600
I never asked anyone.
Yeah,

1280
00:53:15,900 --> 00:53:16,733
Oh my God,
this kid committed suicide after 

1281
00:53:17,791 --> 00:53:21,330
listening to Judas priest.
This is satanic music without a bandit.

1282
00:53:21,360 --> 00:53:24,030
That's the right.
And then you fall off the right,

1283
00:53:24,060 --> 00:53:24,893
the left did,
and then the left came in and now 

1284
00:53:27,391 --> 00:53:29,400
they're fucking doing it.
And now instead of saying,

1285
00:53:29,401 --> 00:53:30,234
well,
video games make you find this a little 

1286
00:53:31,020 --> 00:53:31,853
bit against Mickey hate women.
And then we have a new counterculture 

1287
00:53:34,080 --> 00:53:35,640
that's going to push that back.
And then guess what?

1288
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:37,590
Specificity Rock,
you know,

1289
00:53:37,740 --> 00:53:39,870
guys like you and me,
our whole fucking life,

1290
00:53:40,290 --> 00:53:42,540
we're going to be like,
we'll be in 10 years,

1291
00:53:42,541 --> 00:53:43,374
will be finding the right again,
and then in another 10 years we'll find 

1292
00:53:45,181 --> 00:53:45,790
the left again.

1293
00:53:45,790 --> 00:53:48,670
Yeah.
So that center and that bill,

1294
00:53:48,671 --> 00:53:49,504
you know,
it's interesting that the people that 

1295
00:53:49,991 --> 00:53:50,824
you just mentioned there,
like Laura and Lauren and I'm Milo 

1296
00:53:54,060 --> 00:53:55,420
there,
their role to the right.

1297
00:53:55,421 --> 00:53:56,260
And again,
this is,

1298
00:53:56,470 --> 00:53:57,910
I always feel like God,
I'm,

1299
00:53:57,920 --> 00:54:00,290
I'm the last man standing over here.
Uh,

1300
00:54:00,340 --> 00:54:01,900
but yes it is.
It is growing.

1301
00:54:02,080 --> 00:54:05,000
So how do we then coalesce around that 
knowing that we're,

1302
00:54:05,001 --> 00:54:06,150
we're not going to support.
I don't.

1303
00:54:06,220 --> 00:54:07,810
I'm not sure who I'm going to vote for 
at this point,

1304
00:54:08,060 --> 00:54:10,450
uh,
but that we can sit here and do this.

1305
00:54:10,630 --> 00:54:11,463
How do we coalesce around that idea that
we need conversation more than we need 

1306
00:54:16,300 --> 00:54:18,160
everyone judging everybody into 
oblivion?

1307
00:54:18,250 --> 00:54:18,591
Well,
I have,

1308
00:54:18,591 --> 00:54:19,424
I have a little bit of an idealist and I
truly believe if we're talking to each 

1309
00:54:22,671 --> 00:54:24,170
other,
we're not killing each other.

1310
00:54:24,590 --> 00:54:25,940
That's the start,
right?

1311
00:54:26,120 --> 00:54:29,360
What a lot of people don't realize if 
they haven't studied a lot of history,

1312
00:54:29,780 --> 00:54:30,380
we,
you know,

1313
00:54:30,380 --> 00:54:32,540
we think we can have a Cambodian 
holocaust.

1314
00:54:32,720 --> 00:54:34,880
We think that we can't have an Armenian 
genocide.

1315
00:54:35,030 --> 00:54:38,360
We think we can't have Milo.
Milo is greatly forward or what they had

1316
00:54:38,361 --> 00:54:40,280
in the Soviet Union.
Why can't we?

1317
00:54:40,400 --> 00:54:41,930
Why are we so special?
Well,

1318
00:54:41,931 --> 00:54:43,640
that all started with censorship 
culture.

1319
00:54:43,790 --> 00:54:47,000
You can't say certain things that 
started with us versus them.

1320
00:54:47,001 --> 00:54:49,220
For the Cambodian,
the Cambodian genocide,

1321
00:54:49,221 --> 00:54:51,350
you had the farmers with real people in 
the city.

1322
00:54:51,351 --> 00:54:55,850
People were the bad people.
That was identity politics even within a

1323
00:54:55,851 --> 00:54:58,040
single race of people.
And then what happens?

1324
00:54:58,070 --> 00:54:58,903
You don't talk.
You go to the underground and then the 

1325
00:55:00,210 --> 00:55:01,043
fucking lunatics talked only other Luna 
lunatics because there's still going to 

1326
00:55:04,191 --> 00:55:06,440
talk and then you have all the lunatics 
on the,

1327
00:55:06,441 --> 00:55:07,274
on the ground talking to each other.
That's how you get people blowing shit 

1328
00:55:10,131 --> 00:55:10,964
up.
That's how you get people killing each 

1329
00:55:11,391 --> 00:55:11,570
other.

1330
00:55:11,570 --> 00:55:14,600
Right?
So in an instance where I saw two videos

1331
00:55:14,601 --> 00:55:15,434
this week were one,
a trump supporter was at a rally 

1332
00:55:16,851 --> 00:55:17,684
screaming,
go back to Auschwitz and then another 

1333
00:55:19,311 --> 00:55:20,450
one,
he was screaming at a,

1334
00:55:20,451 --> 00:55:23,720
at a black person,
a go back to Africa.

1335
00:55:24,530 --> 00:55:25,363
I think what you're saying is that 
there's actually something good there 

1336
00:55:27,291 --> 00:55:31,250
because it's being unearthed as opposed 
to these people just festering.

1337
00:55:31,580 --> 00:55:33,500
They're screaming at you,
nobody's hitting each other.

1338
00:55:33,710 --> 00:55:36,380
Nobody is.
People are hitting each other so well.

1339
00:55:36,400 --> 00:55:37,233
The protest is there's,
there's no more than a music festival 

1340
00:55:40,131 --> 00:55:42,230
though the line.
I always use this people,

1341
00:55:42,231 --> 00:55:43,064
you need to get out more,
go to a rock music festival other than 

1342
00:55:45,411 --> 00:55:47,090
May pry burning man.
Nobody fights,

1343
00:55:47,120 --> 00:55:47,953
but other may you know.
But if you go to a rock concert or rap 

1344
00:55:50,031 --> 00:55:52,070
concert,
we have people.

1345
00:55:52,071 --> 00:55:52,904
You're gonna have people kind of 
fighting each other and that's again 

1346
00:55:54,441 --> 00:55:58,340
media manipulation,
logic verse is cognitive bias.

1347
00:55:58,341 --> 00:55:59,780
Okay?
Logically speaking,

1348
00:55:59,990 --> 00:56:04,990
if you have multiple rallies with 25,000
people there and you have 10 of them and

1349
00:56:05,060 --> 00:56:09,450
there's one fight that,
what is that one in $100,000,

1350
00:56:09,560 --> 00:56:11,690
that would be the safest city in the 
world.

1351
00:56:11,691 --> 00:56:14,180
Right?
But you focus on that one fight and that

1352
00:56:14,181 --> 00:56:16,040
becomes the narrative where there's 
violence.

1353
00:56:16,041 --> 00:56:19,970
Well it was,
it was one 78 year old guy punched a guy

1354
00:56:20,300 --> 00:56:22,460
and you know,
the faces sucker punched.

1355
00:56:22,530 --> 00:56:23,363
Okay,
well there had been all these rallies 

1356
00:56:24,251 --> 00:56:26,830
and there's a couple instances.
Logically speaking,

1357
00:56:26,860 --> 00:56:29,740
statistically speaking,
that isn't really a big deal.

1358
00:56:29,840 --> 00:56:30,673
Well,
first of all,

1359
00:56:30,710 --> 00:56:31,543
just to push back on that a little bit,
I mean trump is also offering to pay 

1360
00:56:33,641 --> 00:56:36,820
that guy his legal fees,
which seems pretty crazy to me.

1361
00:56:36,821 --> 00:56:37,654
A guy punched a 70 year old and punched 
a black guy walking out regardless of 

1362
00:56:41,371 --> 00:56:42,550
the,
regardless of his race.

1363
00:56:42,810 --> 00:56:44,830
Um,
but punch the guy and trump saying,

1364
00:56:44,831 --> 00:56:47,770
I'll pay for your legal fees is a bit.
Can you give me that one?

1365
00:56:47,800 --> 00:56:49,650
He offered,
it was a different time that you've,

1366
00:56:49,680 --> 00:56:53,380
you've conflated different stories.
So that was a different riot were.

1367
00:56:53,830 --> 00:56:54,663
So I guess there's a couple of rides.
There are people there are people 

1368
00:56:56,711 --> 00:56:57,760
swinging punches.
I mean,

1369
00:56:58,030 --> 00:56:59,410
did you see,
um,

1370
00:56:59,950 --> 00:57:02,020
did you see what happened when,
um,

1371
00:57:02,250 --> 00:57:03,083
yeah,
I don't want to give a guy free 

1372
00:57:03,401 --> 00:57:04,234
publicity,
but there was a conservative breitbart 

1373
00:57:05,291 --> 00:57:08,470
speaker who gave a talk at cal state Los
Angeles.

1374
00:57:08,980 --> 00:57:09,813
I have videos of a breitbart intern 
being thrown to the ground by a black 

1375
00:57:13,901 --> 00:57:16,090
lives matter protester.
I have the video.

1376
00:57:16,091 --> 00:57:18,190
Lauren Feldman,
the director for silence.

1377
00:57:18,250 --> 00:57:21,190
We have it.
That didn't make news right?

1378
00:57:21,250 --> 00:57:22,083
That suddenly violence goes both ways.
I know everybody likes what the media 

1379
00:57:24,911 --> 00:57:25,744
likes,
but I have no doubt the violence goes 

1380
00:57:26,471 --> 00:57:27,730
both ways.
That's the thing.

1381
00:57:27,731 --> 00:57:30,490
Everybody's doing it.
So that's the interesting thing too,

1382
00:57:30,491 --> 00:57:31,324
about logic versus not logical.
Why don't we objectively count how much 

1383
00:57:34,420 --> 00:57:36,940
drama is going on at,
at Sandra's event,

1384
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:37,840
right?
Well,

1385
00:57:38,170 --> 00:57:42,850
he had a Bernie Sanders supporter jump 
over a guard rail to try to go to attack

1386
00:57:42,851 --> 00:57:43,690
trump.
Right?

1387
00:57:43,691 --> 00:57:46,570
I read the guy's tweets.
The guy is a total nut job.

1388
00:57:46,590 --> 00:57:47,170
Yeah,
he's.

1389
00:57:47,170 --> 00:57:49,870
He goes on CNN and they treat him like 
he is stood up to a bully.

1390
00:57:50,260 --> 00:57:50,950
Right.
Well,

1391
00:57:50,950 --> 00:57:53,320
why is he standing up to bullies trump?

1392
00:57:53,500 --> 00:57:54,430
Why don't you say,
well,

1393
00:57:54,490 --> 00:57:55,420
hey,
you don't like trump.

1394
00:57:55,450 --> 00:57:59,410
Trump's talking now you're trying to 
jump over a guard rail to attack a guy,

1395
00:57:59,411 --> 00:58:03,790
and he'd posted on twitter before high 
wanting to kill trump and why is that?

1396
00:58:03,850 --> 00:58:04,683
Yeah.
It's sort of a nice way to wrap this 

1397
00:58:05,921 --> 00:58:06,754
thing up.
Although clearly we could have gone a 

1398
00:58:07,241 --> 00:58:08,074
lot longer than this,
but it shows what a moral mess 

1399
00:58:09,431 --> 00:58:11,440
everybody's in because I.
I do agree with that.

1400
00:58:11,441 --> 00:58:12,274
Look,
I'm not thrilled with the things trump 

1401
00:58:12,881 --> 00:58:13,451
saying.
Again,

1402
00:58:13,451 --> 00:58:17,200
I'm not supporting the guy,
but when that guy rushed the stage,

1403
00:58:17,320 --> 00:58:18,880
if you look at the history of this guy's
tweets,

1404
00:58:18,881 --> 00:58:19,714
he's a bit of a nut bag.
He said some crazy things and then CNN 

1405
00:58:22,090 --> 00:58:23,710
treated him like a hero.
Now,

1406
00:58:23,711 --> 00:58:26,740
meanwhile,
if a trump supporter had bum rushed,

1407
00:58:26,741 --> 00:58:27,574
Bernie Sanders,
everyone not only would say this guy 

1408
00:58:29,381 --> 00:58:30,214
should be in jail,
but they wouldn't have given him an 

1409
00:58:31,481 --> 00:58:33,760
interview on CNN,
but they'd also be blaming trump.

1410
00:58:33,850 --> 00:58:34,431
So yeah,
there,

1411
00:58:34,431 --> 00:58:36,670
there is an unevenness here that we've 
got to wrap up,

1412
00:58:36,671 --> 00:58:39,070
but I think we did a little evening of 
the playing field here.

1413
00:58:39,071 --> 00:58:39,750
What do you think?
It's.

1414
00:58:39,750 --> 00:58:40,990
We're not logical,
right?

1415
00:58:41,120 --> 00:58:42,190
We're,
we're creatures.

1416
00:58:42,191 --> 00:58:44,350
We want stories.
You want simple stories of the world.

1417
00:58:44,530 --> 00:58:45,363
Trump understands it.
He's playing the game better than 

1418
00:58:47,021 --> 00:58:49,060
everyone else.
That's why they don't like them,

1419
00:58:49,270 --> 00:58:51,010
but yeah,
as long as we're talking,

1420
00:58:51,310 --> 00:58:52,750
you're a human.
I'm a human.

1421
00:58:53,050 --> 00:58:54,790
You know,
I don't want to kill gay people,

1422
00:58:54,930 --> 00:58:56,050
you know,
because I know a gay guy,

1423
00:58:56,051 --> 00:58:57,730
right?
I don't want to kill straight white guys

1424
00:58:57,731 --> 00:59:00,130
even though I had the worst.
Ultimately,

1425
00:59:00,131 --> 00:59:01,630
that's what happens with people.
As you,

1426
00:59:01,660 --> 00:59:03,220
as you talk,
talk to each other,

1427
00:59:03,221 --> 00:59:03,651
you think,
wow,

1428
00:59:03,651 --> 00:59:05,880
I mean you're,
you're saying gay people or this or this

1429
00:59:05,890 --> 00:59:08,080
or that,
but I know a guy and he's not like that.

1430
00:59:08,081 --> 00:59:09,070
Well,
that's not really large.

1431
00:59:09,071 --> 00:59:10,570
I know a guy.
Therefore,

1432
00:59:10,571 --> 00:59:12,910
all gay people or this or that is a 
logical,

1433
00:59:13,030 --> 00:59:14,770
but that's the way we think,
so yeah,

1434
00:59:14,771 --> 00:59:15,604
as long as you're talking,
you're reaching out to people who 

1435
00:59:16,751 --> 00:59:17,584
disagree with you.
Your own illogical brain helps you 

1436
00:59:20,711 --> 00:59:21,680
become a better person.

1437
00:59:22,370 --> 00:59:23,960
That's how you end an interview.
All right,

1438
00:59:23,961 --> 00:59:26,540
so I want to thank Mike Cernovich and 
you can check out his book,

1439
00:59:26,541 --> 00:59:27,374
Gorilla Mindset,
how to control your thoughts and 

1440
00:59:29,181 --> 00:59:31,790
emotions to live life on your terms.
Oh,

1441
00:59:31,791 --> 00:59:34,280
and direct.
All hate directly to him.

1442
00:59:34,281 --> 00:59:36,650
It's at Cernovich on the twitter.
Thanks again,

1443
00:59:36,680 --> 00:59:37,513
and we'll do it again next week.
