1
00:00:54,730 --> 00:00:57,700
All right people,
we are live on the youtube.

2
00:00:57,910 --> 00:01:00,400
I've got the lobster and I've got the 
hair.

3
00:01:00,910 --> 00:01:03,280
It sounds like some sort of seventies 
because that,

4
00:01:03,281 --> 00:01:05,890
could that be a rock band or is that 
like a,

5
00:01:05,970 --> 00:01:10,540
it could be some kind of violent flick 
or a mafia movie or violent band.

6
00:01:10,620 --> 00:01:11,800
Violent rock man.
Yeah.

7
00:01:11,830 --> 00:01:13,780
Alright.
I've wanted to get you guys together.

8
00:01:13,781 --> 00:01:15,670
You two have never been seen on camera 
before.

9
00:01:15,890 --> 00:01:19,280
I think that's true as far as you know,
I,

10
00:01:19,281 --> 00:01:21,970
I did appear in front of Jordan,
but uh,

11
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,160
we never intersected onstage at the 
masonic.

12
00:01:24,161 --> 00:01:28,990
When you decided I should have opened a.
When you paid your mean harmonica,

13
00:01:29,020 --> 00:01:29,920
Harmonica,
Solo.

14
00:01:29,980 --> 00:01:32,590
Out of all the Zany moments that we've 
had in the last two months,

15
00:01:32,591 --> 00:01:34,810
would you say that bringing Eric 
Weinstein,

16
00:01:34,811 --> 00:01:39,811
mathematician out onstage at the masonic
to play the harmonica and have 3000 

17
00:01:39,811 --> 00:01:40,660
people give him a standing ovation?

18
00:01:40,660 --> 00:01:42,310
Would that be at the top?
That was good.

19
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:47,400
That was good.
It worked really well too because he 

20
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:47,400
turned out he actually could play the 
harmonica,

21
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:50,260
which is a good thing if you're going to
try it in front of 3000 people.

22
00:01:50,590 --> 00:01:52,090
It was a first for me.
I've done.

23
00:01:52,150 --> 00:01:54,220
I didn't play it in front of a smaller 
crowd before that,

24
00:01:54,221 --> 00:01:57,250
so that was a bit of a bio.
It was pretty sweet.

25
00:01:57,270 --> 00:01:58,180
All right,
so good night.

26
00:01:58,330 --> 00:01:58,960
Yeah.
All right.

27
00:01:58,961 --> 00:02:02,290
I want to cover 100 percent new stuff 
for the next two hours.

28
00:02:02,291 --> 00:02:07,291
There's a bunch of stuff obviously that 
we've been hitting on on tour and some 

29
00:02:07,291 --> 00:02:09,220
things that we've been sort of catching 
up on as this has all been going on,

30
00:02:09,221 --> 00:02:14,221
so I thought the place to start I think 
would be something that I've been 

31
00:02:14,221 --> 00:02:17,210
starting a lot of the shows with when I 
go out there and I do a little intro and

32
00:02:17,211 --> 00:02:19,390
to get everybody going and warm it up 
for Jordan.

33
00:02:19,810 --> 00:02:24,810
The idea that we're starting to win and 
when I've been saying when there's a 

34
00:02:24,810 --> 00:02:25,870
feeling in the crowd of like,
Whoa,

35
00:02:25,900 --> 00:02:30,100
maybe all of this madness that we've all
been talking about for all these years.

36
00:02:30,101 --> 00:02:34,300
Maybe enough people have woken up now 
that there is something shifting,

37
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:39,720
so I've brought that up a bunch and 
you've sort of picked up on it on a 

38
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:42,871
couple of the shows and talked about why
winning isn't necessarily the way we 

39
00:02:42,941 --> 00:02:45,250
should view this or what winning 
actually.

40
00:02:45,251 --> 00:02:47,810
So I thought that would be a good place 
to kick us off here.

41
00:02:48,450 --> 00:02:51,040
It's more what winning actually is,
you know,

42
00:02:51,190 --> 00:02:56,190
because one of the things that has to be
contended with in the current situation 

43
00:02:56,190 --> 00:02:58,690
is that,
especially in the United States,

44
00:02:58,691 --> 00:03:00,010
but also the rest of the Western

45
00:03:00,010 --> 00:03:02,780
world,
there's a political divide.

46
00:03:02,860 --> 00:03:05,350
Americans have been voting 50 percent 
Republican,

47
00:03:05,351 --> 00:03:07,930
Fifty Percent Democrat for,
for lecture,

48
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:13,080
pretty much split right down the middle 
and there there can't be any final 

49
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:15,760
victory by one side over the other 
because everyone has to live together.

50
00:03:16,090 --> 00:03:21,090
So the victory is how can we continue to
live together peacefully and 

51
00:03:21,401 --> 00:03:23,370
productively and,
and,

52
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:28,560
and,
and we have to figure out the pathway 

53
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:29,590
forward to that.
But then I think there's another kind of

54
00:03:29,591 --> 00:03:32,680
victory that it's deeper than that 
that's on the horizon,

55
00:03:32,681 --> 00:03:37,681
which is that I think the narrative that
underlies our culture as a whole has to 

56
00:03:38,741 --> 00:03:40,810
shift.
And I started to think about this when I

57
00:03:40,811 --> 00:03:43,450
was working for a UN committee about 
five years ago.

58
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:47,470
I worked on a committee on 
sustainability for the secretary general

59
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:52,500
and um,
I had a chance with the people that I 

60
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:54,880
was working for and with in Canada to 
rewrite the underlying narrative because

61
00:03:54,881 --> 00:03:55,990
it was very pessimistic.

62
00:03:55,990 --> 00:04:00,990
It was real cold war narrative north 
against south and capitalists against 

63
00:04:00,990 --> 00:04:02,380
Socialists and doom and gloom on the 
horizon.

64
00:04:02,650 --> 00:04:05,770
And it seemed to me to be outdated 
really by about 40 years.

65
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:11,160
And I started to read a lot of the 
economic development and ecology 

66
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:15,121
literature.
And mostly what I found was that things 

67
00:04:15,121 --> 00:04:18,151
are getting better globally so fast and 
on so many different dimensions that 

68
00:04:18,151 --> 00:04:21,400
it's almost inconceivable.
And yet no one seems to know that.

69
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:26,640
And in the aftermath of that,
there's been about six books published 

70
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:29,521
in the last five years that like 
pinker's book and lightened it right 

71
00:04:29,521 --> 00:04:29,521
over here somewhere.
Yeah,

72
00:04:29,521 --> 00:04:29,620
right.
But,

73
00:04:29,650 --> 00:04:34,650
but uh,
but by no means that's by no means the 

74
00:04:34,650 --> 00:04:37,801
only book detailing now a revolution in 
living standard progress and,

75
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:41,290
and ecological progress for that matter 
around the world.

76
00:04:41,291 --> 00:04:44,380
So I think there's two victories to be 
held here to be had here.

77
00:04:44,381 --> 00:04:49,381
One is to pull us everyone out of the 
pessimistic apocalyptic Cold War 

78
00:04:51,191 --> 00:04:56,191
narrative that enveloped us for four or 
five decades and to notice that the 

79
00:04:56,191 --> 00:04:57,670
future could actually be bright if we 
were careful.

80
00:04:57,671 --> 00:05:02,671
And the second is to make sure that the 
political dialogue in the West doesn't 

81
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:06,430
polarize to the degree that we start 
doing things that are fatally stupid.

82
00:05:06,750 --> 00:05:11,750
All right,
so let's talk about the second part 

83
00:05:11,750 --> 00:05:11,750
first

84
00:05:11,750 --> 00:05:14,100
because I think that's where we've 
really been focusing on the political 

85
00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:16,620
part.
So it's interesting to note there's a 50

86
00:05:16,621 --> 00:05:19,440
slash 50 divides.
I don't think that's a reason.

87
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:24,570
I guess I have a strongly different take
and maybe it's the same.

88
00:05:25,020 --> 00:05:27,570
We'll have to figure that out.
To me,

89
00:05:27,870 --> 00:05:32,870
the 50 slash 50 mark is going to more or
less hold as long as these two parties 

90
00:05:33,151 --> 00:05:37,140
can calculate a what's the maximum they 
can,

91
00:05:37,230 --> 00:05:42,230
uh,
w with the minimum they have to give up 

92
00:05:42,230 --> 00:05:42,230
to win an election.
And so the,

93
00:05:42,230 --> 00:05:44,580
the key issue is what is the 50 slash 50
composition look like?

94
00:05:44,581 --> 00:05:49,581
And unfortunately what it keeps looking 
like is the two parties becoming more 

95
00:05:49,581 --> 00:05:54,291
and more a nightmarish in my mind and 
less trustworthy.

96
00:05:54,391 --> 00:05:56,730
So we,
the 50 slash 50 continues to hold.

97
00:05:57,080 --> 00:06:02,080
But what it represents as a tension,
the tension increases is getting much 

98
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:02,080
worse.

99
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:05,330
So the key issue is that those of us who
are sort of center,

100
00:06:06,140 --> 00:06:08,420
I mean I don't love the left right 
spectrum,

101
00:06:08,421 --> 00:06:13,421
but let's just use it as shorthand that 
the center left and the center right 

102
00:06:13,421 --> 00:06:16,721
have to see each other as our natural 
allies and the center left has to Clean 

103
00:06:16,721 --> 00:06:21,460
House and get rid of the night he left 
and the center right has to get rid of 

104
00:06:21,460 --> 00:06:23,300
the far right.
And that's the optimistic scenario.

105
00:06:23,390 --> 00:06:25,460
I think winning is incredibly important.
Okay.

106
00:06:25,461 --> 00:06:30,461
Well,
that's an interesting way of 

107
00:06:30,461 --> 00:06:30,461
conceptualizing it and let me go a 
little bit further.

108
00:06:30,461 --> 00:06:34,260
Sure.
I think that we have to stop being 

109
00:06:34,260 --> 00:06:36,020
apologetic about winning and what 
winning means.

110
00:06:36,050 --> 00:06:40,580
Winning means that the advanced guard of
the a radical center,

111
00:06:41,090 --> 00:06:46,090
uh,
has to make this a safe and habitable 

112
00:06:46,090 --> 00:06:46,760
space again.
And so in order to do that,

113
00:06:47,050 --> 00:06:48,530
um,
and the reason I,

114
00:06:48,531 --> 00:06:53,531
you know,
try to focus mostly most of my negative 

115
00:06:53,531 --> 00:06:56,561
energy on the left is,
is that it's my responsibility to clean 

116
00:06:56,561 --> 00:07:00,791
house on the radical bad progressive 
movement that is almost certainly going 

117
00:07:01,941 --> 00:07:03,290
to fuel the far right.

118
00:07:04,130 --> 00:07:07,190
It's not efficient for me to go after 
the far right because,

119
00:07:07,510 --> 00:07:12,510
I mean,
of course I'm going to be anti Nazi 

120
00:07:12,510 --> 00:07:12,510
skinhead,
right?

121
00:07:12,510 --> 00:07:16,360
But what we've,
we've talked about that a lot too 

122
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:16,360
because when we do the events,
you know,

123
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:20,291
you will all these hit pieces that come 
out and we'll talk a little bit about 

124
00:07:20,291 --> 00:07:20,291
that.
Well,

125
00:07:20,291 --> 00:07:21,140
when they say that your audience is all 
these angry white men,

126
00:07:21,141 --> 00:07:22,190
you,
all of this nonsense,

127
00:07:22,191 --> 00:07:24,890
which every night it is proven to be 
false,

128
00:07:25,250 --> 00:07:26,810
um,
it's like,

129
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:31,840
yeah,
you address that every night talking 

130
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:31,840
about the bad identity politics of the 
right,

131
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:32,060
but it's not something that well 
bullied.

132
00:07:32,140 --> 00:07:35,480
The thing that's strange and then that 
ties into what you're saying as well,

133
00:07:35,481 --> 00:07:40,210
is that it isn't obvious to me who the 
dangerous right are,

134
00:07:40,650 --> 00:07:45,650
you know,
it's obvious to me who the dangerous 

135
00:07:45,650 --> 00:07:47,160
Lakhdar because they occupied the 
universities but not just the 

136
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:47,160
universities.

137
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:47,160
This is an,
I mean,

138
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:49,160
this is so mispunch,
if you will,

139
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:51,990
that we have to really break the frame 
and,

140
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:53,630
and reweave it.
So,

141
00:07:53,990 --> 00:07:56,930
um,
the journalists keep saying,

142
00:07:56,931 --> 00:08:01,931
oh,
you guys are focusing on a tiny problem 

143
00:08:01,931 --> 00:08:03,350
afflicting a few universities that 
mostly nobody's ever heard of.

144
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:05,130
That's definitely not true.
Well,

145
00:08:05,270 --> 00:08:10,270
the first thing is,
is that it deflects the problem from 

146
00:08:10,270 --> 00:08:13,091
the,
the number one problem isn't the 

147
00:08:13,091 --> 00:08:13,091
universities.
It's journalism.

148
00:08:13,091 --> 00:08:14,450
And so the idea is that the journalists 
are saying,

149
00:08:14,451 --> 00:08:16,630
you guys are complaining about,
uh,

150
00:08:16,730 --> 00:08:18,650
the small story in the university.
It's like,

151
00:08:18,660 --> 00:08:19,970
no,
no,

152
00:08:20,210 --> 00:08:25,210
you're getting it wrong.
We're complaining about the number one 

153
00:08:25,210 --> 00:08:27,851
story,
which is the sensemaking a apparatus 

154
00:08:27,851 --> 00:08:29,900
having gone haywire.
And if you think about these journalists

155
00:08:29,901 --> 00:08:34,901
that we're now dealing with as like the 
hermit crabs that have crawled into the 

156
00:08:34,901 --> 00:08:35,780
shells that we used to know,
right?

157
00:08:35,781 --> 00:08:40,781
So whether it's CNN or NPR or national 
review or whatever these structures are,

158
00:08:41,631 --> 00:08:44,360
it's a different group of hermit crab 
shells are the same.

159
00:08:45,020 --> 00:08:50,020
And the great danger is that if you 
recognize the font at the top of the La 

160
00:08:50,020 --> 00:08:50,540
Times,
The New York Times,

161
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:52,790
you think you're getting the same 
product,

162
00:08:52,791 --> 00:08:54,590
but the product has become radically 
different.

163
00:08:55,050 --> 00:08:56,070
Uh,
and there was a problem

164
00:08:56,070 --> 00:08:57,230
back then.
I'm not saying that,

165
00:08:57,280 --> 00:08:58,380
that,
that there wasn't.

166
00:08:58,410 --> 00:08:59,700
And you know,
of course,

167
00:08:59,701 --> 00:09:04,701
the,
the issue is that when we criticize 

168
00:09:04,701 --> 00:09:06,450
journalists now they think we're 
criticizing journalism far from it.

169
00:09:06,690 --> 00:09:11,000
We are praying for journalists and the 
idea is,

170
00:09:11,001 --> 00:09:16,001
is that we are fighting this thing where
they've got their fingers so clearly on 

171
00:09:16,001 --> 00:09:19,050
the scale that everything is being 
tipped and what you're getting is a more

172
00:09:19,051 --> 00:09:21,120
distorted reality.
There's some point at which,

173
00:09:21,121 --> 00:09:23,610
and we have to talk about what happened 
with,

174
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:26,460
I don't know how to pronounce it best.
IATROGENIC medicine,

175
00:09:26,740 --> 00:09:31,740
the idea that doctors are creating a,
created a huge amount of the harm done 

176
00:09:33,620 --> 00:09:35,370
found in hospitals.
Well,

177
00:09:35,470 --> 00:09:37,740
maybe stairs are the fourth leading 
cause of death,

178
00:09:37,830 --> 00:09:42,830
right?
So now we have to talk not about yet 

179
00:09:42,830 --> 00:09:42,830
regenix which is the,
you know,

180
00:09:42,830 --> 00:09:42,830
the,
the,

181
00:09:42,830 --> 00:09:44,460
that which originates from the healers,
but journal genics,

182
00:09:44,820 --> 00:09:48,240
which is what is the harm done to the 
truth by journalists.

183
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:50,260
And that is,
so I have a,

184
00:09:50,380 --> 00:09:55,380
uh,
a technological slapped on that to some 

185
00:09:55,380 --> 00:09:57,951
degree because one of the things that I 
think is happening because I've watched 

186
00:09:57,951 --> 00:10:00,180
large organizations degenerate because 
I've worked as a consultant for a lot of

187
00:10:00,181 --> 00:10:05,181
years now.
It's really interesting to see how fast 

188
00:10:05,181 --> 00:10:08,950
a large organization that you think is 
semipermanent can disintegrate.

189
00:10:09,180 --> 00:10:10,470
It can happen.
Well,

190
00:10:10,471 --> 00:10:15,471
certainly within the span of a couple of
years and sometimes a lot faster than 

191
00:10:15,471 --> 00:10:15,471
not.
Yes.

192
00:10:15,471 --> 00:10:16,470
Well,
and I think one of the things that seems

193
00:10:16,471 --> 00:10:21,471
to be happening to me is that as 
television dies under the weight of 

194
00:10:21,471 --> 00:10:25,340
youtube primarily,
but let's say online video and perhaps 

195
00:10:25,340 --> 00:10:28,080
also podcasts,
is that the remaining journalists,

196
00:10:28,110 --> 00:10:30,180
the hermit crabs who occupied the old 
shells,

197
00:10:30,181 --> 00:10:31,590
which is a good way of thinking about 
it,

198
00:10:31,980 --> 00:10:34,320
gets increasingly desperate for 
attention.

199
00:10:34,620 --> 00:10:39,620
And so there are pushed by economic 
pressure in some sense and situational 

200
00:10:39,620 --> 00:10:41,310
pressure to exaggerate the danger.

201
00:10:41,540 --> 00:10:46,540
It's like.
And it's a clickbait phenomena 

202
00:10:46,540 --> 00:10:48,471
essentially.
And it seems to me to be akin to what's 

203
00:10:48,471 --> 00:10:48,471
happened with,
with reports on the crime rate.

204
00:10:48,510 --> 00:10:49,050
So,
you know,

205
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:54,080
over the last 25 years,
the five major indices of violent crime 

206
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:56,820
have declined by 50 percent,
which is absolutely in,

207
00:10:56,950 --> 00:10:59,460
in the United States.
Staggering decrease.

208
00:10:59,790 --> 00:11:03,780
But the rate of reporting of violent 
crime has gone up substantially.

209
00:11:03,781 --> 00:11:07,410
And so people think that things are more
dangerous now than they were,

210
00:11:07,590 --> 00:11:10,740
even though they're safer now than they 
have been since the early sixties.

211
00:11:10,860 --> 00:11:13,260
And they were safe for them than they'd 
ever been in history.

212
00:11:13,590 --> 00:11:18,590
So I think one of the things in it,
and it's interesting to think about the 

213
00:11:18,590 --> 00:11:22,011
technological forces driving this 
because youtube and podcast do pose a 

214
00:11:22,860 --> 00:11:27,860
fatal threat,
I would say certainly to to to 

215
00:11:27,860 --> 00:11:30,981
television and so it makes sense to me 
that as the journalists become less 

216
00:11:30,981 --> 00:11:34,710
professional and less in demand and 
their messages Ha has,

217
00:11:34,820 --> 00:11:35,760
has,
is,

218
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:40,140
is chasing a diminishing audience that 
they're going to get noisier and noisier

219
00:11:40,141 --> 00:11:45,141
about what's going on and the trick for 
everyone else who's being immersed in 

220
00:11:45,141 --> 00:11:49,470
that is to stay sane and sensible while 
the death throes play themselves out.

221
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:54,520
So wouldn't you naturally think though 
that more of them would start seeing 

222
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:54,520
this?
I mean what we

223
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:56,470
now see,
so clearly I meant more of them would be

224
00:11:56,471 --> 00:12:00,880
jumping ship or is that old shells so 
tainted or corroded?

225
00:12:00,881 --> 00:12:03,130
That getting out of that thing is almost
impossible.

226
00:12:03,131 --> 00:12:04,780
It has to do with systems of selective 
pressure.

227
00:12:04,781 --> 00:12:09,781
So Jordan raises an excellent point that
the dying throws of an institution tend 

228
00:12:10,961 --> 00:12:15,961
to be its most violent because it's go 
for broke mode and not worrying about 

229
00:12:15,961 --> 00:12:19,651
tomorrow.
It's worrying about maybe serve up 

230
00:12:19,651 --> 00:12:19,651
buying another month or two or who knows
what,

231
00:12:19,651 --> 00:12:22,540
but there's another issue of course,
which is that the formats are set.

232
00:12:22,890 --> 00:12:27,130
Uh,
so your news comes to you in a form that

233
00:12:27,131 --> 00:12:30,310
is more or less the same every day and 
so you know how to consume it.

234
00:12:30,610 --> 00:12:32,780
So everybody listens to NPR,
has a pre,

235
00:12:32,781 --> 00:12:37,781
grooved a template in their brain.
I'm going to get the top stories at the 

236
00:12:37,781 --> 00:12:42,211
top of the hour and then they're going 
to be this many pieces and there'll be 

237
00:12:42,211 --> 00:12:42,211
like a feel good story.

238
00:12:42,211 --> 00:12:44,830
So you know exactly what you're going to
get.

239
00:12:44,870 --> 00:12:46,070
Like here,
we don't know where we're going to.

240
00:12:46,110 --> 00:12:48,810
Maybe Jordan and I are going to come to 
blows open.

241
00:12:49,980 --> 00:12:54,700
You've got to change the drink.
But the other thing that,

242
00:12:54,850 --> 00:12:55,350
uh,
is,

243
00:12:55,351 --> 00:12:57,190
is it in the system of selective 
pressures,

244
00:12:57,191 --> 00:13:02,191
as the business model fails,
you have a fascinating phenomena which 

245
00:13:02,191 --> 00:13:03,120
people who are willing to accept,
um,

246
00:13:03,370 --> 00:13:04,700
strange,
uh,

247
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:07,270
uh,
blends of payment.

248
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:11,920
So lower financial payment and security 
job security,

249
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:16,570
but higher psychic payment stemming from
the idea that they are crusading,

250
00:13:17,090 --> 00:13:18,850
uh,
are going to start to dominate.

251
00:13:18,851 --> 00:13:23,851
So you're seeing many more people who 
are willing to substitute activism and 

252
00:13:23,851 --> 00:13:27,760
the sense that they are protecting us.
And a great story about the resistance,

253
00:13:27,761 --> 00:13:28,770
let's say.
Yeah,

254
00:13:29,650 --> 00:13:34,650
so that,
that actually becomes more and more 

255
00:13:34,650 --> 00:13:36,250
necessary as the stability and the 
viability of the system degenerate,

256
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:36,460
right?

257
00:13:36,460 --> 00:13:38,050
If you could offer,
um,

258
00:13:38,380 --> 00:13:39,880
you know,
$200,000

259
00:13:39,881 --> 00:13:43,690
salaries to a good reporters,
uh,

260
00:13:43,750 --> 00:13:48,750
in short order so that they could start 
families and buy homes and have an 

261
00:13:48,750 --> 00:13:52,291
easier life.
Like one of the things that you need to 

262
00:13:52,291 --> 00:13:52,540
do is you need to pay people more if 
you're unhappy with them.

263
00:13:52,541 --> 00:13:54,340
And this,
I think I learned about that,

264
00:13:54,341 --> 00:13:57,370
about professors to actually sociology 
professors had,

265
00:13:57,371 --> 00:13:59,680
their salary's tripled.
They'd be a lot less radically.

266
00:13:59,681 --> 00:14:04,681
I learned this from the New Orleans 
police department where at some point 

267
00:14:04,681 --> 00:14:07,210
they had a corruption where people were 
ordering a mob style,

268
00:14:07,211 --> 00:14:12,211
hits over police radio.
And I think what happened was that the 

269
00:14:12,211 --> 00:14:15,690
new police chief came in and he said the
first thing he did was raise salaries 

270
00:14:15,690 --> 00:14:19,770
and the idea being that you have to have
skin in the game thanks to the scene to 

271
00:14:19,770 --> 00:14:21,640
levees that phrases a proliferative 
thanks the same wherever you are,

272
00:14:22,020 --> 00:14:26,080
um,
and you need to give people something to

273
00:14:26,081 --> 00:14:26,680
defend.

274
00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:30,160
And so it's very important to pay the 
people that we are,

275
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:33,250
um,
decrying all the time.

276
00:14:33,970 --> 00:14:38,510
Say everybody who's listening should go 
online and donate to quill.

277
00:14:38,511 --> 00:14:43,180
X patron page is doing great.
What I'm saying that we should,

278
00:14:43,210 --> 00:14:47,320
we should try to figure out how to get 
vox more money as well and we should try

279
00:14:47,321 --> 00:14:52,321
to figure out how to get slate and salon
and all of these things so that you can 

280
00:14:52,321 --> 00:14:56,201
afford to pay people in ways in which 
they don't have to take a large portion 

281
00:14:57,651 --> 00:15:02,630
of their payment as psychic 
gratification from having Feld Imaginary

282
00:15:02,630 --> 00:15:03,590
Dragon.
But just to be clear there,

283
00:15:03,591 --> 00:15:08,591
when you're saying that,
you're not saying that the current 

284
00:15:08,591 --> 00:15:10,520
people who have screwed this whole thing
up deserve more money.

285
00:15:11,150 --> 00:15:12,470
You're going to find,
you can find,

286
00:15:12,471 --> 00:15:14,930
I have a very strange position on this,
which is in,

287
00:15:15,010 --> 00:15:15,660
in,
you know,

288
00:15:15,690 --> 00:15:16,820
my,
my friend Peter Teal,

289
00:15:16,821 --> 00:15:18,410
and I talk about this all the time.

290
00:15:18,980 --> 00:15:20,690
Uh,
his model is that,

291
00:15:20,930 --> 00:15:25,930
you know,
at some level when the economy isn't 

292
00:15:25,930 --> 00:15:28,181
working,
people engage in this kind of 

293
00:15:28,181 --> 00:15:29,180
nonsensical,
a fratricide,

294
00:15:29,220 --> 00:15:29,860
uh,
of a,

295
00:15:29,870 --> 00:15:32,540
of a type.
And my point is slightly different,

296
00:15:33,020 --> 00:15:36,800
which is this,
this bad nature is always there,

297
00:15:36,801 --> 00:15:39,550
but it's like a compromised immune 
system when the,

298
00:15:39,710 --> 00:15:44,710
when the economy starts to fail,
you start to become aware of all of the 

299
00:15:44,710 --> 00:15:46,910
pathogens in the world because it can't 
fight them off.

300
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:52,000
And so it's,
it's very much the issue that if you're 

301
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:55,301
the guy with compromised immune system,
you're the only one aware of all the 

302
00:15:55,301 --> 00:15:55,301
pathogens in the world.
Um,

303
00:15:55,340 --> 00:15:59,090
and so at the moment our collective 
economic community system is failing,

304
00:15:59,390 --> 00:16:04,390
uh,
and I actually am much more pessimistic 

305
00:16:04,390 --> 00:16:06,761
than you are Jordan.
I see lots of reasons to be happy about 

306
00:16:06,761 --> 00:16:06,890
the decrease in violence.
But you know,

307
00:16:06,891 --> 00:16:11,891
one of the problems with the accounting 
in these theories is that the sword of 

308
00:16:11,891 --> 00:16:15,131
Damocles that hangs over our heads is,
has gotten quite large and the number of

309
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:20,800
threads holding it up or seem very few 
in number and so you have to do the 

310
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:25,361
potential energy accounting as well as 
the realized violence and also 

311
00:16:26,031 --> 00:16:30,770
understanding that the nature of an 
income inequality and um,

312
00:16:31,790 --> 00:16:36,790
differential access to financial markets
and technology is creating a lot of very

313
00:16:36,981 --> 00:16:41,981
justifiable concern that the post World 
War II stability it is constantly in 

314
00:16:43,551 --> 00:16:46,880
jeopardy and we don't,
I personally think we should think about

315
00:16:47,180 --> 00:16:52,180
once every five years above ground 
nuclear tests to remind ourselves of 

316
00:16:52,180 --> 00:16:55,260
what it is that we've pushed underground
and we haven't seen for years because we

317
00:16:55,270 --> 00:16:59,210
are engaged in some kind of magical 
thinking that the world is fairly stable

318
00:16:59,211 --> 00:17:00,950
and that can turn on a dime.

319
00:17:01,340 --> 00:17:06,340
So what kind of out do you think we 
could for this crew of journalists that 

320
00:17:06,771 --> 00:17:09,620
were talking about that we want to be 
doing more journalism.

321
00:17:09,621 --> 00:17:12,140
We don't want them to be attacked or any
of those things.

322
00:17:12,141 --> 00:17:14,420
Of course.
What is the out?

323
00:17:14,421 --> 00:17:15,670
So the I get it.
You can give.

324
00:17:15,700 --> 00:17:18,380
You could fund them in a way that gives 
them a little more breathing room,

325
00:17:18,381 --> 00:17:20,480
but one of the things that I'm seeing 
when we're on tour is p,

326
00:17:20,510 --> 00:17:22,550
everyone that comes up to me after says,
wow,

327
00:17:22,551 --> 00:17:24,890
you just gave us a little room to think.
Yeah,

328
00:17:25,010 --> 00:17:28,820
so is there a way we,
instead of beating these journalists,

329
00:17:28,821 --> 00:17:31,760
instead of getting the wind where you 
crush them so that they are losers,

330
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,790
what's the way that we can give them 
maybe a little.

331
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:36,030
Well,
I mean it,

332
00:17:36,060 --> 00:17:41,060
it's,
it's sort of standard behavioral 

333
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:41,060
practice.
In some senses.

334
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:43,580
This is something that was established 
by skinner a long while back even though

335
00:17:43,581 --> 00:17:48,581
he used threaten punishment as ways of 
altering the behavior of his 

336
00:17:48,581 --> 00:17:49,800
experimental animals.
He also used reward

337
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:54,420
but rewards a lot harder to use because 
what you have to do is you have to watch

338
00:17:54,660 --> 00:17:59,660
very carefully and then when you see an 
increment in the behavior that you want 

339
00:17:59,660 --> 00:18:00,780
to want to promote,
you have to reward it,

340
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:04,110
but it requires a tremendous amount of 
tension and subtle attention.

341
00:18:04,111 --> 00:18:07,080
And so one of the things that we can 
certainly do,

342
00:18:07,081 --> 00:18:10,440
and that I've been trying to do to some 
degree with my twitter account is to,

343
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:16,040
is to distribute good news,
good credible news and good journalism 

344
00:18:16,201 --> 00:18:21,201
when I see it,
which is partly why I started to get 

345
00:18:21,201 --> 00:18:21,201
engaged,
say with Colette,

346
00:18:21,201 --> 00:18:22,470
because I think they're doing a credible
job,

347
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:27,920
but one possibility is to distribute 
those pieces that seem to be 

348
00:18:30,150 --> 00:18:35,150
increasingly reasonable and another is 
to also leaped to the defense of people 

349
00:18:35,150 --> 00:18:39,951
when they're taken out as individuals 
and because one of the things that's 

350
00:18:40,261 --> 00:18:45,261
happening now is that when an individual
stands up and says something especially 

351
00:18:45,261 --> 00:18:49,341
that annoys the radical left,
is that they tend to get mobbed and 

352
00:18:49,341 --> 00:18:49,590
taken out and that's a bad thing.

353
00:18:49,590 --> 00:18:52,740
It would be good if we could figure out 
ways of defending people against that.

354
00:18:53,030 --> 00:18:58,030
I mean,
Brett has been defended to some degree 

355
00:18:58,030 --> 00:18:59,040
by the emergence of this group of people
that,

356
00:18:59,100 --> 00:19:02,280
that Eric has been describing as the 
intellectual dark web.

357
00:19:02,690 --> 00:19:07,620
And so there is some strength in numbers
there that might be usefully applied.

358
00:19:07,740 --> 00:19:10,470
Can you just quickly talk about that?
Just on the personal level,

359
00:19:10,471 --> 00:19:15,471
because I think one of the most moving 
things that I've heard on this show is 

360
00:19:15,471 --> 00:19:15,471
when,
uh,

361
00:19:15,471 --> 00:19:19,550
I had you on and I think,
I think it was with bread and you said 

362
00:19:19,550 --> 00:19:23,060
that standing with him was really one of
the most validating things that you've 

363
00:19:23,060 --> 00:19:27,171
ever done in your life and it's such an 
example of what you've been talking 

364
00:19:27,171 --> 00:19:29,580
about on the tour that if you want to 
fix the world than fix yourself a little

365
00:19:29,581 --> 00:19:34,581
bit and then the more that you do that,
you might start effecting things around 

366
00:19:34,581 --> 00:19:34,581
you.
And I think that that's by,

367
00:19:34,581 --> 00:19:38,220
by helping your brother in this case you
were sorta helping the world.

368
00:19:39,060 --> 00:19:40,170
Well,
um,

369
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:42,390
yeah,

370
00:19:44,300 --> 00:19:47,990
that's nice.
But the returns to me,

371
00:19:48,770 --> 00:19:53,770
um,
were high and has nothing to do with 

372
00:19:53,770 --> 00:19:53,880
follower counts on twitter or anything 
like that.

373
00:19:55,730 --> 00:19:57,470
I don't think that,
you know,

374
00:19:57,560 --> 00:20:02,560
we should talk about positive models of 
masculinity and I'm standing shoulder to

375
00:20:04,251 --> 00:20:09,251
shoulder with somebody in a fight is an 
important part of what it means to be 

376
00:20:09,561 --> 00:20:14,561
complete in a masculine sense.
And I think that we are all incentivized

377
00:20:15,681 --> 00:20:20,040
by shows like survivor or the last 
contest or whatever,

378
00:20:20,041 --> 00:20:25,041
all this stuff.
And they do the promos with the 

379
00:20:25,041 --> 00:20:26,030
contestants on these shows.
I'm not here to make friends.

380
00:20:26,090 --> 00:20:27,830
I'm here to win.
Okay,

381
00:20:27,831 --> 00:20:31,690
well what is that?
That's corporate America teaching us how

382
00:20:31,700 --> 00:20:34,430
to stab everyone else in the back on 
your way to the top,

383
00:20:34,460 --> 00:20:36,590
which actually doesn't work very well by
the way.

384
00:20:36,591 --> 00:20:39,110
Didn't work at all right or not for that
long.

385
00:20:39,410 --> 00:20:41,180
If you can't follow,
you can't lead,

386
00:20:41,860 --> 00:20:43,940
can't make friends,
can't make friends.

387
00:20:44,150 --> 00:20:46,190
You're alone and vulnerable,
right?

388
00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:49,800
You,
I mean maybe stolen had gotten to the is

389
00:20:49,890 --> 00:20:53,590
the best example of a really malignant 
person who managed to kill everybody,

390
00:20:53,591 --> 00:20:58,450
including I think his wife.
But it's very rare that anybody,

391
00:20:58,760 --> 00:21:00,610
you know,
does that really what,

392
00:21:00,611 --> 00:21:05,611
what these things are.
Because you have to remember that 

393
00:21:05,611 --> 00:21:08,100
fragging is a possibility that the 
lowest person in your organization can 

394
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:09,720
take you down if they're not happy.
Right?

395
00:21:09,750 --> 00:21:10,390
Right,
right.

396
00:21:10,450 --> 00:21:15,450
And so I think that what people need to 
understand is that there is this lost 

397
00:21:15,450 --> 00:21:17,740
art of standing with somebody that you 
don't.

398
00:21:17,741 --> 00:21:20,460
One hundred percent agree with who says 
things that are like,

399
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:25,520
you know,
there are definitely things you do on 

400
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:27,681
stage that I'm not comfortable with,
but if somebody comes to attack you a 

401
00:21:27,681 --> 00:21:28,240
fundamentally,
um,

402
00:21:28,360 --> 00:21:30,690
I know that all of those points I can 
bring up to you,

403
00:21:31,180 --> 00:21:32,080
you know,
face to face.

404
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:37,080
I assume it's true in reverse.
And so this idea of standing with 

405
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:37,080
people,
you know,

406
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:41,821
Dave,
you've been going down to libertarian 

407
00:21:41,821 --> 00:21:41,821
path that I'm uncomfortable with often,
but somebody says,

408
00:21:41,821 --> 00:21:43,680
you know,
we hash it out publicly and privately,

409
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:47,410
publicly and privately and so,
and there's stuff I'll do privately with

410
00:21:47,411 --> 00:21:52,411
you that I won't do publicly because I 
think that it is important to learn how 

411
00:21:52,781 --> 00:21:56,290
to stand in units because otherwise you 
just get picked off.

412
00:21:56,291 --> 00:21:57,100
And this is,
you know,

413
00:21:57,340 --> 00:21:59,500
there's a topic that I want to bring up 
a little bit later,

414
00:21:59,501 --> 00:22:03,520
which is what do I think the Idw,
since you've discussed it gets wrong.

415
00:22:03,700 --> 00:22:08,700
And one thing I think we get wrong is 
that the tribalism that we keep seeing 

416
00:22:08,771 --> 00:22:11,920
is so toxic that we decided that we are 
anti tribal.

417
00:22:12,700 --> 00:22:17,700
It's not the right model.
You want to be adaptively tribal and 

418
00:22:17,700 --> 00:22:18,610
adaptively individualistic,
right?

419
00:22:18,610 --> 00:22:20,650
These things matter.
Groups matter.

420
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:23,590
Groups have specialized knowledge very 
often,

421
00:22:23,591 --> 00:22:23,860
you know,
I,

422
00:22:24,280 --> 00:22:27,070
my group has certain stuff.
Your group has a different.

423
00:22:27,071 --> 00:22:28,800
We engage in trade.
Um,

424
00:22:29,260 --> 00:22:34,260
it is important to understand that 
tribalism can be adaptive and so it's 

425
00:22:34,331 --> 00:22:39,331
very troubling to me that the dumbest 
voices on the other side are causing us 

426
00:22:40,601 --> 00:22:44,770
to overreact too simplistically.
So standing with my brother.

427
00:22:45,460 --> 00:22:50,460
Yeah,
there's a reason that people say he's 

428
00:22:50,460 --> 00:22:52,441
like a brother to me because it means 
that you will put yourself at great 

429
00:22:52,441 --> 00:22:52,441
risk.
And I,

430
00:22:52,441 --> 00:22:56,851
you know,
I've taken a lot of slings and arrows 

431
00:22:56,851 --> 00:22:56,851
for,
for Brett,

432
00:22:56,851 --> 00:22:58,570
and there's a pleasure in it.
I'm not going to say that it didn't lead

433
00:22:58,571 --> 00:23:01,990
to sleepless nights and that I don't 
worry about friends that I've lost,

434
00:23:02,350 --> 00:23:03,340
but it's also,
you know,

435
00:23:03,341 --> 00:23:08,341
in some sense,
good to know and people respond 

436
00:23:08,341 --> 00:23:10,210
positively because it's in our,
it's in our makeup to to say,

437
00:23:10,211 --> 00:23:11,890
well,
that guy didn't run from a fight.

438
00:23:12,190 --> 00:23:15,760
So do we basically have to just model it
out for people in our behavior.

439
00:23:15,761 --> 00:23:20,761
So for example,
when the New York Times piece came out 

440
00:23:20,761 --> 00:23:21,740
on you about three weeks ago,
the enforced monogamy piece,

441
00:23:22,100 --> 00:23:23,530
now that the author of it,
I,

442
00:23:23,531 --> 00:23:25,370
I'm not even going to mention her name,
but if you want to,

443
00:23:25,371 --> 00:23:28,270
you can go ahead and she sat in the 
green room with us,

444
00:23:28,271 --> 00:23:31,900
I think on the first night in Toronto.
She was all smiles and friendly.

445
00:23:32,050 --> 00:23:37,050
You even said to me how much you like 
her and you introduced me to her and we 

446
00:23:37,050 --> 00:23:37,050
were,
you know,

447
00:23:37,050 --> 00:23:37,050
we were chatting.
Um,

448
00:23:37,050 --> 00:23:39,100
she seemed perfectly pleasant and 
lovely.

449
00:23:39,101 --> 00:23:44,101
And then of course this piece comes out,
it implies that you're for forced 

450
00:23:44,101 --> 00:23:44,140
monogamy,
which is which money.

451
00:23:44,141 --> 00:23:45,560
Just explain that real.
Just do a,

452
00:23:45,570 --> 00:23:46,040
do a one

453
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:49,100
minute on what you were taught.
The implication was,

454
00:23:49,101 --> 00:23:49,650
and,
and,

455
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:55,000
and to the degree that this has been,
let's say exaggerated in the aftermath 

456
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,770
of the piece,
the implication was that I was promoting

457
00:23:57,771 --> 00:23:59,440
the idea that,
you know,

458
00:23:59,540 --> 00:24:04,540
perfectly innocent women would be lined 
up by the state and distributed en mass 

459
00:24:04,540 --> 00:24:06,230
to undeserving males.
They wouldn't be violent.

460
00:24:06,231 --> 00:24:07,910
We've only done that at one show,
right?

461
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:08,630
Yeah.
Well,

462
00:24:08,631 --> 00:24:09,680
exactly,
exactly.

463
00:24:09,681 --> 00:24:10,280
It's,
and it didn't,

464
00:24:10,281 --> 00:24:11,490
it didn't go.
So yeah,

465
00:24:12,050 --> 00:24:12,860
so,
so,

466
00:24:13,310 --> 00:24:13,870
and,
and that,

467
00:24:13,871 --> 00:24:18,871
that was quite curious because that part
of the conversation I had with the 

468
00:24:18,871 --> 00:24:22,211
journalist lasted probably two minutes 
out of what was essentially a two day 

469
00:24:22,211 --> 00:24:25,190
interview and it was obviously something
that triggered her imagination,

470
00:24:25,680 --> 00:24:26,170
um,
in,

471
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:30,260
in the sense that she saw that she could
use it for,

472
00:24:30,261 --> 00:24:31,220
for,
I don't know,

473
00:24:31,221 --> 00:24:33,860
for political purposes or something like
that in the piece,

474
00:24:34,190 --> 00:24:36,950
but it was so palpably absurd because 
the,

475
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:42,040
and I would say amateurish in some sense
as well because the position that she 

476
00:24:42,040 --> 00:24:43,310
accused me of holding a,
a,

477
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:46,160
I didn't hold so that that's the first 
problem.

478
00:24:46,340 --> 00:24:48,560
B,
no one holds.

479
00:24:48,780 --> 00:24:53,780
Like if you're going to try to pillory 
someone in a manner that's at least 

480
00:24:53,780 --> 00:24:54,890
vaguely believable,
you should accuse them of holding a view

481
00:24:54,891 --> 00:24:59,720
that at least some person has held at 
some point and no one has ever held that

482
00:24:59,990 --> 00:25:04,990
view.
And then the other thing that was quite 

483
00:25:04,990 --> 00:25:06,440
off putting let's say is that she's not 
stupid.

484
00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:10,940
She knew perfectly well what I meant by 
enforced monogamy by the term.

485
00:25:11,100 --> 00:25:16,100
It's an anthropological term,
it's been used for a hundred years and 

486
00:25:16,100 --> 00:25:20,051
the idea that polygamous societies,
which would be the contrast say to 

487
00:25:20,051 --> 00:25:21,770
monogamous society is the idea that 
there are more violent,

488
00:25:21,771 --> 00:25:24,030
is no one disputes that.
It's,

489
00:25:24,100 --> 00:25:25,940
it's like a,
it's an anthropological,

490
00:25:25,941 --> 00:25:29,660
sociological and psychological truism.
And it's also one that's been.

491
00:25:30,050 --> 00:25:32,690
It's not like the left has been 
promoting polygamy,

492
00:25:33,220 --> 00:25:33,950
you know,
so,

493
00:25:33,980 --> 00:25:35,600
so it was,
it was,

494
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:37,340
well the,
the,

495
00:25:37,430 --> 00:25:38,090
the,
the,

496
00:25:38,180 --> 00:25:42,080
the article uh,
surprised me to say the least,

497
00:25:42,350 --> 00:25:43,930
but you made an interesting move

498
00:25:44,090 --> 00:25:47,090
after that which ties this all together 
because you did a little checking on the

499
00:25:47,091 --> 00:25:49,670
phrase in the Archives of the New York 
Times.

500
00:25:49,790 --> 00:25:54,790
And the whole point to me was if I could
take Jordan out of the equation and I 

501
00:25:55,731 --> 00:25:59,090
could make it into the New York Times 
wrestling with itself.

502
00:26:00,110 --> 00:26:05,110
Uh,
I was pretty sure that the New York 

503
00:26:05,110 --> 00:26:07,540
Times would have some record of having 
used the phrase enforced monogamy at 

504
00:26:07,540 --> 00:26:09,260
some point.
And so I went to the search engine and I

505
00:26:09,261 --> 00:26:12,050
put in quote enforcement Origami close 
quote.

506
00:26:12,260 --> 00:26:17,260
And sure enough,
there were two relatively recent 

507
00:26:17,260 --> 00:26:17,260
references within the last 20,
25 years,

508
00:26:17,570 --> 00:26:19,280
both of them positive.
One,

509
00:26:19,970 --> 00:26:24,970
I believe coming out of evolutionary 
theory in drosophila where it's a less 

510
00:26:24,970 --> 00:26:29,801
common term and evolutionary theory,
but it has leaked into the evolutionary 

511
00:26:29,801 --> 00:26:34,001
literature and the other one coming from
Afghanistan where you have polygamous 

512
00:26:35,390 --> 00:26:38,660
marriage and that leaves too many 
violent young men with nothing to do.

513
00:26:38,660 --> 00:26:41,420
And that can be useful if you're 
conquesting other lands,

514
00:26:41,660 --> 00:26:41,990
say,
well,

515
00:26:41,991 --> 00:26:43,300
you have no wife here,
but there's a,

516
00:26:43,350 --> 00:26:46,320
there's territory over there.
And this is exactly,

517
00:26:46,350 --> 00:26:51,350
you know,
the New York Times was celebrating the 

518
00:26:51,350 --> 00:26:52,830
idea that in a culture that was at that 
stage in its evolution,

519
00:26:53,130 --> 00:26:58,130
uh,
enforcement origami was something that 

520
00:26:58,130 --> 00:26:58,130
went hand in hand with women's rights 
because of course,

521
00:26:58,140 --> 00:27:03,140
having the classic art,
you having fewer violent men with no 

522
00:27:03,140 --> 00:27:06,060
romantic prospects is in general good 
for the safety of women.

523
00:27:06,390 --> 00:27:08,910
And so the whole thing,
which is actually my point,

524
00:27:10,660 --> 00:27:15,660
but the point was,
can I take Jordan out of it and say the 

525
00:27:15,660 --> 00:27:16,950
New York Times is wrestling with itself 
and not unfairly.

526
00:27:17,190 --> 00:27:20,010
And this is the great danger is that 
that finger is on the scale.

527
00:27:20,011 --> 00:27:25,011
Now,
the other thing is that that particular 

528
00:27:25,011 --> 00:27:25,011
journalist first met,
uh,

529
00:27:25,011 --> 00:27:29,420
was talking with Brett.
I'm well before talking with you and 

530
00:27:29,420 --> 00:27:30,180
then Brett set this journalist to me.

531
00:27:30,510 --> 00:27:35,510
And by the way,
I don't think that we should not talk 

532
00:27:35,510 --> 00:27:37,731
about the name of the journalist and the
journalist is certainly using your name 

533
00:27:37,731 --> 00:27:38,490
and the idea.
So it's Nellie Bowles.

534
00:27:38,580 --> 00:27:43,170
And I found her engaging and charming,
very quick,

535
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:48,200
intelligent.
The thing that I didn't appreciate and 

536
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:50,590
they got fairly far into my discussion 
with her and I was off the record,

537
00:27:50,591 --> 00:27:52,110
is she began with the gambit.
Well,

538
00:27:52,111 --> 00:27:54,570
of course I'm going to be running your 
tweet on James Damore,

539
00:27:54,870 --> 00:27:55,700
which,
um,

540
00:27:56,310 --> 00:28:01,310
you know,
went viral and was widely 

541
00:28:01,310 --> 00:28:01,310
misinterpreted.
And again,

542
00:28:01,310 --> 00:28:05,481
in a deliberate fashion,
which my tweet was responding to 

543
00:28:05,481 --> 00:28:05,481
somebody saying,
you know,

544
00:28:05,481 --> 00:28:08,550
if human resources that somebody else 
from Google tweeted,

545
00:28:08,551 --> 00:28:10,740
if human resources won't do something 
about this,

546
00:28:10,741 --> 00:28:15,741
then you know,
they're going to have trouble on their 

547
00:28:15,741 --> 00:28:15,741
hands.
And I was like,

548
00:28:15,741 --> 00:28:18,771
okay,
you're telling people to run to human 

549
00:28:18,771 --> 00:28:18,771
resources because James Demore,
uh,

550
00:28:18,771 --> 00:28:22,710
is looking at big five psychometrics for
personality and asking the question,

551
00:28:22,711 --> 00:28:27,711
how do we increase the accessibility of 
Google to female coders and whether you 

552
00:28:28,261 --> 00:28:29,850
agree with his technique or not.

553
00:28:30,120 --> 00:28:32,280
Uh,
I think that that was clearly his point.

554
00:28:32,281 --> 00:28:37,281
So the idea is I'm going to bring up 
this tweet that has been widely 

555
00:28:37,281 --> 00:28:38,520
mischaracterized of yours,
Eric,

556
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:43,880
and you know what,
what became clear was she had the idea 

557
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:48,771
that you wanted to find the men's rights
activist community and you know,

558
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:51,420
she said something about,
well,

559
00:28:51,421 --> 00:28:55,350
your Mra.
And I didn't even know what that meant.

560
00:28:55,351 --> 00:28:56,880
So I said,
NRA,

561
00:28:57,990 --> 00:29:00,480
National Rifle Association.
And she's like,

562
00:29:00,481 --> 00:29:01,920
you know,
men's rights activists.

563
00:29:01,950 --> 00:29:05,040
I said what?
And so we had this.

564
00:29:05,100 --> 00:29:07,440
Well that was just you being 
disingenuous because of course,

565
00:29:07,441 --> 00:29:09,100
you know it,
men's rights activists are right.

566
00:29:11,280 --> 00:29:13,770
But the point would be,
you know,

567
00:29:13,771 --> 00:29:15,810
it's like you,
you believe in human rights.

568
00:29:15,811 --> 00:29:17,030
Yes.
Well,

569
00:29:17,190 --> 00:29:22,190
you know,
men are human so you believe in men's 

570
00:29:22,190 --> 00:29:22,190
rights and you believe that one should 
be active,

571
00:29:22,190 --> 00:29:22,320
you know.
So you know,

572
00:29:22,550 --> 00:29:27,550
at some level it's a reserved term for 
people who are very often kind of 

573
00:29:27,550 --> 00:29:32,120
veering a spectrum of people who are 
talking about bad aspects of family law 

574
00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:35,430
versus people who are downright 
misogynist.

575
00:29:36,180 --> 00:29:39,180
And I was just aghast,
which is like,

576
00:29:39,181 --> 00:29:43,570
why are you trying to shoehorn me into 
this preexisting thing?

577
00:29:43,700 --> 00:29:46,090
That's the question.
The motivation for the,

578
00:29:46,150 --> 00:29:49,720
for the shoe horning and well this is.
So this is the big issue coming,

579
00:29:49,750 --> 00:29:51,610
you know,
it's hard to track all the threads.

580
00:29:51,611 --> 00:29:56,611
Let me,
let me just get back to what we don't 

581
00:29:56,611 --> 00:29:58,660
understand is that they've invested in 
all of this cognitive Lego,

582
00:29:59,110 --> 00:30:00,150
right?
So they've,

583
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:05,320
you know,
equity or toxic masculinity or white 

584
00:30:05,320 --> 00:30:06,970
privilege,
whatever these things are.

585
00:30:07,420 --> 00:30:12,420
And so everything in high dimensional 
space gets shoved into this completely 

586
00:30:13,481 --> 00:30:17,680
inappropriate kind of cognitive lego.
Which furthermore,

587
00:30:17,710 --> 00:30:21,910
the format of these things,
like I recently got asked to do a bit on

588
00:30:21,911 --> 00:30:23,590
a,
on a show on television,

589
00:30:23,591 --> 00:30:26,380
on an established network.
And they said,

590
00:30:26,381 --> 00:30:27,970
you know,
we're really blowing it out.

591
00:30:27,971 --> 00:30:28,330
We've,
we've,

592
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:32,200
we've got the message that this new form
of a long form interview,

593
00:30:32,660 --> 00:30:34,300
uh,
is the wave of the future.

594
00:30:34,301 --> 00:30:34,750
It's like,
well,

595
00:30:34,870 --> 00:30:38,020
how much am I going to get?
We might go from five to eight minutes,

596
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:43,080
right?
The idea is I want to say hello in five 

597
00:30:43,080 --> 00:30:43,080
minutes.
This is the point,

598
00:30:43,080 --> 00:30:47,941
right?
It's like I have access to three hours 

599
00:30:47,941 --> 00:30:47,941
when I want it.
Right?

600
00:30:47,941 --> 00:30:47,941
You're like,
well,

601
00:30:47,941 --> 00:30:47,941
that's insane,
right?

602
00:30:48,030 --> 00:30:53,030
It's like they can't move that much.
And so that's partly why the formats 

603
00:30:53,030 --> 00:30:54,370
dying.
And it's also,

604
00:30:54,371 --> 00:30:57,310
I think one of the reasons that we think
we're stupid or than we are.

605
00:30:57,450 --> 00:31:00,250
I like listening to a lot of our,
including our audience is that,

606
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:01,810
you know,
because tv,

607
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:07,080
one of the things I have noticed about 
television in general is that it's 

608
00:31:07,080 --> 00:31:09,100
predicated on the presumption that the 
audience is stupid,

609
00:31:09,490 --> 00:31:14,490
but if you have to force everything 
through a channel whose maximum 

610
00:31:14,490 --> 00:31:16,820
dimension is six minutes,
then everyone's going to look was.

611
00:31:16,821 --> 00:31:21,520
The stupid thing is if you think about 
what happened where television went from

612
00:31:21,521 --> 00:31:26,521
being the dumb medium to the incredibly 
smart medium when you went from TV 

613
00:31:28,301 --> 00:31:32,710
dramas have a half an hour,
maybe an hour in length to many,

614
00:31:32,711 --> 00:31:37,711
many shows over a season and developing 
characters at a level that a film can't 

615
00:31:37,711 --> 00:31:39,990
touch literature approaches.
Right?

616
00:31:40,040 --> 00:31:40,560
Right,
right.

617
00:31:40,570 --> 00:31:44,320
So the idea is that in the sopranos or 
mad men or game of thrones,

618
00:31:44,590 --> 00:31:49,590
people are following incredibly 
difficult enrich plots and you have to 

619
00:31:49,590 --> 00:31:54,451
go back to this old adage which nobody 
ever lost a dime a underestimating the 

620
00:31:54,451 --> 00:31:55,570
intelligence of the American people.

621
00:31:55,750 --> 00:31:58,090
Well,
that's only true if you don't understand

622
00:31:58,091 --> 00:32:01,090
opportunity cost because people have 
been losing dimes,

623
00:32:01,091 --> 00:32:06,091
but millions by not understanding that 
anyone who can follow game of thrones,

624
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:12,120
right?
How is it that this thing that we're 

625
00:32:12,120 --> 00:32:12,120
about to do,
I have no idea why.

626
00:32:12,120 --> 00:32:12,120
You know,
we're just having a conversation.

627
00:32:12,520 --> 00:32:14,920
There's going to be over 100,000
views of this thing.

628
00:32:15,160 --> 00:32:16,480
I think very quickly.
Yeah.

629
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:19,810
I got one video on my channel of any 
substance,

630
00:32:20,160 --> 00:32:22,990
one video.
It's got nearly 60,000

631
00:32:22,991 --> 00:32:27,991
views.
People are hungry for this thing that 

632
00:32:27,991 --> 00:32:31,041
they're being starved for.
What they don't understand in the 

633
00:32:31,041 --> 00:32:34,501
regular media is is that their format is
killing them and I know this is 

634
00:32:34,501 --> 00:32:39,271
something we really.
We really have to pay attention to it 

635
00:32:39,271 --> 00:32:40,700
because a tremendous amount of what's 
going on is the consequence.

636
00:32:40,820 --> 00:32:43,820
You know,
you said that a complex reality is being

637
00:32:43,821 --> 00:32:45,030
shoveled into a,
a,

638
00:32:45,080 --> 00:32:48,860
a tiny dimensional space and so there's 
some ideological reasons for that,

639
00:32:49,340 --> 00:32:53,570
but I think some of that is being fed by
the channels of the media because it's a

640
00:32:53,571 --> 00:32:58,571
lot easier to take a complex situation 
like that and shovel it into a 

641
00:32:58,571 --> 00:33:02,150
preexisting April interpretive space 
because everyone already understands it.

642
00:33:02,600 --> 00:33:07,600
So if you've only got a few minutes,
then there's a bunch of things that you 

643
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:08,830
don't have to explain because you're 
just telling the same old story.

644
00:33:09,050 --> 00:33:09,880
Because what,
what,

645
00:33:10,120 --> 00:33:11,660
what we also don't grasp

646
00:33:12,160 --> 00:33:16,510
is that we don't file flight plans like 
you're having me on the show.

647
00:33:16,511 --> 00:33:18,010
You don't know what,
what I'm going to say.

648
00:33:18,011 --> 00:33:19,900
You don't know what my positions are on 
immigration.

649
00:33:19,901 --> 00:33:21,490
You don't know what my physicians are an
abortion.

650
00:33:21,491 --> 00:33:22,700
We've never gotten to that,
I don't think,

651
00:33:23,290 --> 00:33:25,510
and I was actually thinking that about 
both of you.

652
00:33:25,511 --> 00:33:27,600
I don't think we've ever discussed it.
We can't get it,

653
00:33:28,180 --> 00:33:31,270
but what the way the,
the,

654
00:33:31,300 --> 00:33:36,300
this commentary at works and I've been 
waking up to the idea that the slayer 

655
00:33:36,300 --> 00:33:37,870
even exists because they didn't think 
about it too much,

656
00:33:38,350 --> 00:33:43,350
is that mostly these people have 
consistent takes that is they are 

657
00:33:43,350 --> 00:33:46,980
counted upon to take complicated reality
and you know,

658
00:33:47,080 --> 00:33:49,450
give us the Tom Friedman point,
give us the,

659
00:33:49,510 --> 00:33:51,710
give us the Paul Krugman point,
you know,

660
00:33:51,730 --> 00:33:54,670
give us the Ezra Klein view and you're 
thinking,

661
00:33:55,060 --> 00:33:58,000
well,
why is there a sort of regular,

662
00:33:58,001 --> 00:34:00,870
consistent view on these things?
Like,

663
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:05,880
I've watched Jordan,
I've watched you change your mind in 

664
00:34:05,880 --> 00:34:08,221
real time as somebody makes a good 
argument and it's a little bit painful 

665
00:34:08,221 --> 00:34:08,221
because somebody was listening to you 
and then they say,

666
00:34:08,221 --> 00:34:09,740
well,
how do I have faith in your argument?

667
00:34:09,741 --> 00:34:12,250
And that might answer is how do you 
faith in any of this stuff?

668
00:34:12,270 --> 00:34:14,620
All of this stuff can reverse it.
Won't you have more faith?

669
00:34:14,830 --> 00:34:19,830
If somebody can reverse themselves?
And I'm thinking about this thing about 

670
00:34:19,830 --> 00:34:20,900
the the cake baking a cake for a gay.

671
00:34:21,130 --> 00:34:21,850
Yes,
yes.

672
00:34:21,851 --> 00:34:26,851
Well look what happened when we'll get 
back to nellie bowles because I want to 

673
00:34:26,851 --> 00:34:27,280
return to that.
But you know,

674
00:34:27,281 --> 00:34:30,460
one of the things that was really 
interesting to watch in Vancouver,

675
00:34:30,461 --> 00:34:33,430
I just had two discussions with Sam 
Harris and the.

676
00:34:33,910 --> 00:34:38,910
The discussion was set up from a 
promotional perspective by a promoter 

677
00:34:38,910 --> 00:34:41,710
who was doing his job as a kind of a 
combat situation,

678
00:34:41,711 --> 00:34:42,880
right?
There was going to be a victory.

679
00:34:42,881 --> 00:34:46,450
It would be sam or me in,
in the final analysis versus it actually

680
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:47,740
versus.
Right.

681
00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:52,800
And so,
but what happened was that Sam and I 

682
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:56,610
actually had a discussion where we were 
trying to lay out our points to 

683
00:34:56,610 --> 00:34:57,490
understand each other's points.
And we set this up.

684
00:34:57,491 --> 00:35:01,510
It was one of Brett's ideas actually 
because your brother a moderated.

685
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:07,200
When the second discussion opened,
what he had us do was summarize each 

686
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:07,200
other's arguments.

687
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:09,820
So I put forth Sam's arguments in the 
strongest possible terms.

688
00:35:09,821 --> 00:35:11,740
Steel man,
he did the same and that worked.

689
00:35:11,890 --> 00:35:16,890
That worked just fine by the way.
But what was so interesting was the 

690
00:35:16,890 --> 00:35:20,791
audience would have settled for a debate
that culminated in the victory of one of

691
00:35:21,251 --> 00:35:26,251
us over the other.
But instead what happened was they got 

692
00:35:26,251 --> 00:35:29,941
engaged in a discussion that we had both
designed to push both of our 

693
00:35:29,941 --> 00:35:32,680
capabilities of thinking farther along 
and so,

694
00:35:33,110 --> 00:35:38,110
and we weren't sure if that would work 
because we weren't sure if we could 

695
00:35:38,110 --> 00:35:40,471
talk,
but it turned out that we could partly 

696
00:35:40,471 --> 00:35:42,681
thanks to breads help and then the 
original format was we were going to 

697
00:35:42,681 --> 00:35:46,551
talk for an hour for the first one and 
then we're going to open it up to q and 

698
00:35:46,551 --> 00:35:49,521
a.
But the discussion got very intense and 

699
00:35:49,521 --> 00:35:52,040
I would have,
I likened it to approximate level of a 

700
00:35:52,040 --> 00:35:52,660
pretty good phd defense,
you know,

701
00:35:52,940 --> 00:35:53,550
if,
if you're,

702
00:35:53,610 --> 00:35:57,090
if you have a good student who's,
who's defending and you know,

703
00:35:57,091 --> 00:36:02,091
they know the literature,
you can really go after them because it 

704
00:36:02,091 --> 00:36:02,091
gives them a chance to show their 
mastery.

705
00:36:02,091 --> 00:36:06,500
Right.
So it can be a real positive thing for 

706
00:36:06,500 --> 00:36:06,540
them.
And so it was like a dual phd defense,

707
00:36:06,570 --> 00:36:09,270
D U,
a l and D u e l at the same time,

708
00:36:09,660 --> 00:36:13,440
but the audience was right there with us
and then at the end of the hour,

709
00:36:13,530 --> 00:36:18,530
Brett asked them should we switch to the
q and a or should we continue the 

710
00:36:18,530 --> 00:36:18,530
discussion because we're in the middle 
of something.

711
00:36:18,530 --> 00:36:23,361
And overwhelmingly the sentiment was 
continue the discussion and so we did 

712
00:36:23,361 --> 00:36:28,191
model the process of,
I wouldn't say respectful dialogue 

713
00:36:28,191 --> 00:36:29,550
because first of all that's a cliche and
second of all,

714
00:36:29,551 --> 00:36:33,360
that wasn't what this was.
What we were doing was actually engaging

715
00:36:33,361 --> 00:36:37,260
in the process of trying to make both of
us smarter than we were.

716
00:36:37,740 --> 00:36:42,150
And and people are are in for that.
They're there,

717
00:36:42,180 --> 00:36:47,180
they're onboard for that and they would.
They would prefer that to the cheap 

718
00:36:47,180 --> 00:36:47,180
victory by all appearances.

719
00:36:47,180 --> 00:36:51,950
So what do you think that says then if 
that the audience that was there and 

720
00:36:51,950 --> 00:36:56,151
from what I can see with our audiences,
that they care more about an unlocking 

721
00:36:57,631 --> 00:37:00,270
some truths than they do about the 
victory.

722
00:37:00,271 --> 00:37:04,290
When we live in a time where everyone 
wants to dunk on everybody constantly,

723
00:37:04,291 --> 00:37:06,880
I keep seeing the phrase pop up,
we'll get you a dunk.

724
00:37:06,950 --> 00:37:08,230
Dinah,
you haven't.

725
00:37:08,250 --> 00:37:10,590
That's nobody wants it,
but they keep shuttling,

726
00:37:10,850 --> 00:37:12,050
loves he wants it.
I mean,

727
00:37:12,090 --> 00:37:17,090
well,
it's better than being bored and it's 

728
00:37:17,090 --> 00:37:17,090
better than stacy's and it's better than
capitulation,

729
00:37:17,550 --> 00:37:20,790
but it's not as good as what could be if
you got what was optimal.

730
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:23,970
When I see this with my own videos,
people keep chopping them up and say,

731
00:37:23,971 --> 00:37:25,650
you know,
Peterson demolishes,

732
00:37:26,820 --> 00:37:29,850
obviously that's click bait,
but that was also one of the things that

733
00:37:29,851 --> 00:37:33,750
made me think about the degeneracy 
degeneration of journalism per se,

734
00:37:33,751 --> 00:37:38,751
and to Bait clickbait mean that's 
emerging spontaneously on youtube as a 

735
00:37:38,751 --> 00:37:40,260
method for attracting attention and 
these people,

736
00:37:40,261 --> 00:37:41,790
as they get more desperate,
as their,

737
00:37:41,791 --> 00:37:45,270
as their modality dies,
then it's not surprising that they,

738
00:37:45,450 --> 00:37:50,450
that they turn to their 
oversimplifications for the reasons you 

739
00:37:50,450 --> 00:37:54,501
outlined,
but also to attract attention real 

740
00:37:54,501 --> 00:37:54,501
quick.

741
00:37:54,501 --> 00:37:54,501
Is it possible that it worked for 
awhile,

742
00:37:54,501 --> 00:37:58,140
that that sort of exposure and clickbait
nonsense made sense?

743
00:37:58,290 --> 00:37:59,850
Sort of at the beginning of the 
Internet,

744
00:38:00,090 --> 00:38:03,760
because we were all so stuck in the,
uh,

745
00:38:03,770 --> 00:38:07,080
in the old structures that we needed 
something to really wake us up,

746
00:38:07,320 --> 00:38:12,320
but now we're sort of past that.
You don't think so that we don't think 

747
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:12,320
we're past it enough that it doesn't 
work anymore.

748
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:15,330
If you want to avoid having me as a 
guest in the future,

749
00:38:15,331 --> 00:38:20,331
here's one of the standard moves that I 
may stop talking about what's good and 

750
00:38:20,331 --> 00:38:23,361
bad and started putting the phrase 
adaptive and maladaptive in front of 

751
00:38:23,361 --> 00:38:24,750
different modalities.
We like adaptive dumb dunking.

752
00:38:25,240 --> 00:38:27,540
I've got this problem with this guy,
Noah Smith.

753
00:38:27,541 --> 00:38:29,540
I don't know what his problem is.
He,

754
00:38:29,570 --> 00:38:33,480
he's an economist.
He's engaging.

755
00:38:33,960 --> 00:38:35,980
He's a relatively

756
00:38:35,980 --> 00:38:40,980
charming.
He has got a position on immigration 

757
00:38:40,980 --> 00:38:40,990
where he just loves immigration.
There's nothing.

758
00:38:41,050 --> 00:38:46,050
You can't have too much immigration.
Immigration is just the best thing in 

759
00:38:46,050 --> 00:38:48,601
the world.
Maybe it has some problems in some 

760
00:38:48,601 --> 00:38:50,701
sector,
but in general it's a free lunch and 

761
00:38:50,701 --> 00:38:51,820
I've done work on this to try to show.
No.

762
00:38:51,821 --> 00:38:56,821
It's a much more complicated situation 
and behind the scenes it's being abused 

763
00:38:56,821 --> 00:39:01,530
as has nothing to do with immigrants.
It's Americans transferring wealth into 

764
00:39:01,530 --> 00:39:03,310
their own pockets from other Americans 
using immigrants.

765
00:39:03,311 --> 00:39:06,340
We can get into this later.
I've tried,

766
00:39:06,341 --> 00:39:09,880
I've had lunch with the guy I've shown 
in my papers,

767
00:39:09,881 --> 00:39:14,881
my research.
He absolutely does not want a 

768
00:39:14,881 --> 00:39:16,540
discussion.
What does he want?

769
00:39:16,660 --> 00:39:21,660
Well,
he wants to have an idea that 

770
00:39:21,660 --> 00:39:25,470
immigration is a pure good.
And that know the National Academy of 

771
00:39:26,230 --> 00:39:31,230
Sciences has found that if we get this 
benefit from it and it has to do with 

772
00:39:31,230 --> 00:39:32,290
one rights which don't show up in,
in a,

773
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:34,540
in a maximum,
in an economics framework.

774
00:39:34,900 --> 00:39:39,900
It has to do with something involving 
the securitization of rights so that 

775
00:39:39,900 --> 00:39:42,460
people don't have their rights taken as 
if by eminent domain.

776
00:39:42,670 --> 00:39:47,670
Um,
he knows all this stuff and he just 

777
00:39:47,670 --> 00:39:48,500
chooses to continue down this path.
And that Sam has seen this with Reza,

778
00:39:49,540 --> 00:39:50,530
Reza,
Aslan,

779
00:39:50,940 --> 00:39:53,020
um,
and with Glenn Greenwald,

780
00:39:53,021 --> 00:39:55,960
who in some ways I always thought of as 
pretty positive.

781
00:39:56,230 --> 00:39:57,490
And then I,
you know,

782
00:39:57,491 --> 00:40:02,491
he gets,
he gets a bug in his head and you get 

783
00:40:02,491 --> 00:40:06,391
these incredibly negative people who 
don't want to come into a discussion and

784
00:40:07,151 --> 00:40:12,151
it's important to reserve the dunking on
modality for when people are really not 

785
00:40:14,501 --> 00:40:16,480
acting as good actors.
You know,

786
00:40:16,970 --> 00:40:21,970
that's kind of what I did with.
I decided to take a lawsuit out against 

787
00:40:21,970 --> 00:40:22,810
Wilfrid laurier two weeks ago and that 
was,

788
00:40:23,120 --> 00:40:23,830
um,
you know,

789
00:40:23,831 --> 00:40:28,831
I've been trying to reserve my twitter 
defense that say or attack because it's 

790
00:40:28,931 --> 00:40:31,300
not always easy to distinguish between 
those.

791
00:40:31,600 --> 00:40:32,620
Like I,
I,

792
00:40:32,740 --> 00:40:37,570
I've learned to leave people alone when 
they make untoward comments,

793
00:40:37,930 --> 00:40:42,930
unless they are journalists of some 
repute or professors of some repute,

794
00:40:44,830 --> 00:40:49,330
in which case I think I have a moral 
obligation not to remain silent.

795
00:40:49,720 --> 00:40:53,020
And so it's not so easy to figure out 
when you should defend yourself and when

796
00:40:53,021 --> 00:40:58,021
you should shut up.
Well first before is the wrong time to 

797
00:40:58,021 --> 00:40:58,240
do and prefer that we don't defend 
ourselves because it's,

798
00:40:58,270 --> 00:41:00,370
as you always have this problem with 
special pleading,

799
00:41:00,371 --> 00:41:02,530
are you defending yourself because you 
believe in the ideas?

800
00:41:02,740 --> 00:41:07,740
Are you defending yourself?
Because it's a possible threat to your 

801
00:41:07,740 --> 00:41:07,740
own reputation.
Right?

802
00:41:07,740 --> 00:41:11,660
So that's one of the reasons I came to 
your assistance on the enforcement 

803
00:41:11,660 --> 00:41:12,400
origami thing because I didn't want you 
having to make that point.

804
00:41:12,790 --> 00:41:17,790
And if at some point in the future I get
into trouble and you think that I have 

805
00:41:17,790 --> 00:41:18,280
married my position,
perhaps you'll return the favor.

806
00:41:18,280 --> 00:41:20,050
We can figure out the game theory later.
But that's,

807
00:41:20,280 --> 00:41:25,280
that's what culture actually does.
But doesn't that also just feed the 

808
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:28,171
beast in a certain way?
So if you defend a professor goes after 

809
00:41:28,171 --> 00:41:28,171
you,
who has,

810
00:41:28,171 --> 00:41:28,171
you know,
no,

811
00:41:28,171 --> 00:41:30,370
no notoriety,
but just wants to get in on the game.

812
00:41:30,760 --> 00:41:33,290
Well now you've defended yourself.
Now next thing you know,

813
00:41:33,500 --> 00:41:35,990
voxer,
buzzfeed is writing about the professor.

814
00:41:35,991 --> 00:41:37,730
Nobody knows.
And Jordan Peterson.

815
00:41:38,330 --> 00:41:40,100
Well that's a danger for sure.
Look,

816
00:41:40,670 --> 00:41:45,670
I am also,
I am not a huge fan of the dunk on 

817
00:41:45,670 --> 00:41:48,641
mentality as a opening gambit.
I am slow to anger in these situations.

818
00:41:49,041 --> 00:41:51,080
I tend to give people three benefits of 
the doubt,

819
00:41:51,260 --> 00:41:53,020
which is what you should do.
Yeah.

820
00:41:53,090 --> 00:41:53,960
And so,
you know,

821
00:41:53,961 --> 00:41:58,961
for example,
I had as recline and his wife over for 

822
00:41:58,961 --> 00:42:00,220
Shabbat dinner with Gad said,
um,

823
00:42:00,980 --> 00:42:02,660
you know,
after the Sam Harris thing,

824
00:42:02,750 --> 00:42:05,870
and I wanted to understand as position 
and Ezra had,

825
00:42:06,110 --> 00:42:11,110
in fact,
vox had done a piece where I talked 

826
00:42:11,110 --> 00:42:13,721
about the need to blend hyper capitalism
with hyper socialism in the future 

827
00:42:13,721 --> 00:42:14,330
because I think,
and throw up,

828
00:42:14,430 --> 00:42:16,610
I think about this thing of anthropic 
capitalism.

829
00:42:16,610 --> 00:42:21,610
The capitalism that worked in the 19th 
and 20th centuries may have been an 

830
00:42:21,610 --> 00:42:25,331
accident for where the parameters were 
set on in our market so that it could 

831
00:42:25,331 --> 00:42:27,320
function as well as it did.
And you know,

832
00:42:27,321 --> 00:42:28,490
Ezra,
um,

833
00:42:28,491 --> 00:42:31,070
I don't want to get into all the 
personal details of the interaction,

834
00:42:31,340 --> 00:42:36,340
but it was fascinating talking to Ezra 
and his wife as to how they see the 

835
00:42:36,340 --> 00:42:40,421
world and getting a behind the scenes 
look at what generates vox.

836
00:42:41,770 --> 00:42:46,770
So I think it's very important to try to
be charitable in understanding other 

837
00:42:47,211 --> 00:42:49,340
people and understanding their 
motivations.

838
00:42:49,341 --> 00:42:51,800
But there is a point when you hit 
something three,

839
00:42:51,801 --> 00:42:55,490
four or five times the person's 
evidenced comprehension.

840
00:42:55,700 --> 00:43:00,700
And then they go into this mode,
like you talked about this with Kathy 

841
00:43:00,700 --> 00:43:04,210
Newman where you had one kind of 
interaction with her before and then 

842
00:43:04,210 --> 00:43:04,210
suddenly somebody three,
two,

843
00:43:04,210 --> 00:43:04,210
one go.

844
00:43:04,490 --> 00:43:06,410
And it's like,
so what you're really saying,

845
00:43:06,920 --> 00:43:11,920
where did that personality come out of 
that has to do in part with the masks 

846
00:43:12,111 --> 00:43:14,390
that we all put on.
I think that one of the things is,

847
00:43:14,391 --> 00:43:16,970
I know you guys both personally,
um,

848
00:43:17,090 --> 00:43:22,090
this mirrors it how we talk in a 
different context.

849
00:43:24,260 --> 00:43:25,250
But when you know,
when,

850
00:43:25,280 --> 00:43:28,520
when vox is the weeds discussed the 
intellectual dark web,

851
00:43:28,760 --> 00:43:32,330
I thought it was incredibly confused.
Very interestingly,

852
00:43:32,331 --> 00:43:37,331
after the Barry Weiss article,
almost no one from the standard media 

853
00:43:37,331 --> 00:43:39,560
called me up to clarify,
sort of learn more because barry was the

854
00:43:39,561 --> 00:43:44,561
owner of this thing and so it was 
assumed that barry had named it that 

855
00:43:44,561 --> 00:43:47,760
this was barry's beat.
And so barry was the goto person as if 

856
00:43:47,760 --> 00:43:49,820
we were all owned by the particular 
member of the commentary.

857
00:43:49,821 --> 00:43:52,430
That who decided to actually blow this 
up and make it large?

858
00:43:53,510 --> 00:43:57,590
We have to become more charitable.
I do think that in part,

859
00:43:57,890 --> 00:44:02,890
part of the problem that we've been 
having with the sort of madness in the 

860
00:44:02,890 --> 00:44:04,370
progressives is that first of all,
unlike the Charlottesville,

861
00:44:04,371 --> 00:44:09,371
right,
the progressives are in the 

862
00:44:09,371 --> 00:44:12,071
establishment.
Whereas the Tiki torch holders are like 

863
00:44:12,071 --> 00:44:13,880
often their mother's garage and that's a
big,

864
00:44:13,881 --> 00:44:18,881
big difference.
And so one of the reasons were animated 

865
00:44:18,881 --> 00:44:18,881
is that,
you know,

866
00:44:18,881 --> 00:44:21,200
you remember that line.
It's coming from inside the house.

867
00:44:21,201 --> 00:44:23,180
Yeah.
It's coming from inside the house.

868
00:44:23,181 --> 00:44:24,740
Definitely.
On the other hand,

869
00:44:26,060 --> 00:44:31,060
I do see a lot of points that these 
people have that they're just terribly 

870
00:44:31,060 --> 00:44:33,050
missing stantiating the problem of the 
progressives in my,

871
00:44:33,110 --> 00:44:35,010
in my estimation,
I might have.

872
00:44:35,220 --> 00:44:37,800
My family has been progressive since the
twenties,

873
00:44:38,840 --> 00:44:40,530
is that they're terrible at what they 
do.

874
00:44:40,560 --> 00:44:44,690
They're just not good progressive.
It's like really malignant form.

875
00:44:45,220 --> 00:44:46,050
Let me give you an example.

876
00:44:47,640 --> 00:44:52,640
English is odd in that it is inflicted 
for gender only in the third person 

877
00:44:53,221 --> 00:44:56,400
singular.
Now Turkish for example,

878
00:44:56,460 --> 00:44:58,650
it's not inflected for gender.
There's one pronoun.

879
00:44:58,710 --> 00:45:01,260
Oh,
for Kishi it.

880
00:45:01,860 --> 00:45:03,840
So you don't have this problem in 
Turkish.

881
00:45:04,160 --> 00:45:09,160
Um,
when you were referring to a character 

882
00:45:09,160 --> 00:45:09,320
in the story who is not present,
um,

883
00:45:09,690 --> 00:45:14,690
we had this problem for a in English 
form inflicted influxion for marital 

884
00:45:15,091 --> 00:45:20,091
status,
which was true for females and not 

885
00:45:20,091 --> 00:45:20,091
males.
Mr Was Mr.

886
00:45:20,091 --> 00:45:21,840
but miss and Mrs gave you more 
information.

887
00:45:22,230 --> 00:45:27,230
So there was a one time backwards,
incompatible change that got made with 

888
00:45:27,230 --> 00:45:28,000
ms and it,
you know,

889
00:45:28,010 --> 00:45:29,970
it's still rankles because it doesn't 
sound great,

890
00:45:30,240 --> 00:45:32,720
but I think it was a good idea and to 
make,

891
00:45:32,820 --> 00:45:37,820
to give women the equality that they 
deserved and shouldn't have to ask for.

892
00:45:38,100 --> 00:45:40,740
Okay.
If you wanted to actually do the pronoun

893
00:45:40,741 --> 00:45:45,741
thing for English,
would you start with trans or would you 

894
00:45:45,741 --> 00:45:46,170
start with intersects now?

895
00:45:46,170 --> 00:45:51,170
If you started with intersects,
everyone is intellectually sympathetic 

896
00:45:51,170 --> 00:45:55,580
with Intersex.
There are people whose gender or sex is 

897
00:45:55,580 --> 00:45:56,170
ambiguous,
right?

898
00:45:56,280 --> 00:46:01,280
Because of the way in which development 
sort of takes female and turns it into 

899
00:46:01,280 --> 00:46:03,640
mail if the SROI protein is present.
So this,

900
00:46:03,690 --> 00:46:05,630
everyone who understands this,
just to be clear,

901
00:46:05,650 --> 00:46:08,520
not everyone who hears about this,
but everyone who has in general,

902
00:46:08,550 --> 00:46:13,550
no matter how conservative somebody is,
if I tell them there's a person born 

903
00:46:13,550 --> 00:46:15,570
with ambiguous genitalia,
um,

904
00:46:15,750 --> 00:46:18,180
or you know,
they've got an Sroi protein,

905
00:46:18,540 --> 00:46:22,260
a on an x chromosome or they have a 
malfunctioning one on a why,

906
00:46:22,261 --> 00:46:25,530
so that they appear to be the opposite 
phenotype for their genotype.

907
00:46:26,160 --> 00:46:29,030
There's compassion.
The person was born in Seoul,

908
00:46:29,040 --> 00:46:34,040
was born without the expected assignment
and there's no question about 

909
00:46:34,040 --> 00:46:36,210
development.
And should we be steering.

910
00:46:36,570 --> 00:46:38,940
You should be more male.
You should be more masculine,

911
00:46:39,240 --> 00:46:42,270
more feminine in order to avoid the sky 
high.

912
00:46:42,390 --> 00:46:47,390
I'm suicidal.
A temptations for people who feel that 

913
00:46:47,390 --> 00:46:49,800
they are one thing well evidencing that 
they are something else in the physical.

914
00:46:50,520 --> 00:46:55,520
Okay.
You would make the change based on 

915
00:46:55,520 --> 00:46:58,011
intersects.
You'd make a onetime backwards 

916
00:46:58,011 --> 00:47:00,351
incompatible change to the language with
a approach pronoun like Turkish has.

917
00:47:01,620 --> 00:47:06,240
And then trans would have what it wanted
without this craziness of everybody gets

918
00:47:06,241 --> 00:47:10,260
to design their own personal pronoun,
which is a disaster.

919
00:47:10,261 --> 00:47:13,020
Like in a computer science course,
you would never allow people,

920
00:47:13,290 --> 00:47:18,290
you,
you'd give them a choice so that the 

921
00:47:18,290 --> 00:47:18,290
coding can go through.
Everybody can't have their own pronouns.

922
00:47:18,600 --> 00:47:21,720
Right?
And so that's how you do it.

923
00:47:22,200 --> 00:47:26,220
And if you wanted it to win,
that's how you push it through.

924
00:47:26,430 --> 00:47:31,430
Now what they want is something else 
they want to say something like Trans 

925
00:47:31,900 --> 00:47:36,040
Women are no less women than women who 
are born biologically female.

926
00:47:36,100 --> 00:47:37,480
Well,
that's not true,

927
00:47:37,960 --> 00:47:38,290
right?

928
00:47:38,980 --> 00:47:43,980
I understand.
It is the case that every single 

929
00:47:43,980 --> 00:47:46,951
culture,
every traditional culture of which I'm 

930
00:47:46,951 --> 00:47:47,200
aware there is gender ambiguity in South
Sulawesi.

931
00:47:47,201 --> 00:47:49,990
You have a priestly class from it.
In India,

932
00:47:49,991 --> 00:47:51,820
you have the hidden cameras.
Um,

933
00:47:52,510 --> 00:47:54,570
Turkeys,
national treasure,

934
00:47:54,680 --> 00:47:58,210
a Zeki Muren was more feminine than 
Liberace.

935
00:47:58,450 --> 00:48:03,450
Uh,
I just came from Italy where the Uffizi 

936
00:48:03,450 --> 00:48:06,570
Gallery,
there's an entire room called the 

937
00:48:06,570 --> 00:48:06,570
hermaphrodite room,
a dedicated to a beautiful statue,

938
00:48:06,570 --> 00:48:07,330
uh,
of,

939
00:48:07,360 --> 00:48:08,980
uh,
ostensibly female,

940
00:48:09,250 --> 00:48:14,250
um,
recumbent a model with a male genitalia 

941
00:48:14,250 --> 00:48:14,840
that there is,
you know,

942
00:48:15,820 --> 00:48:20,820
not the Shah of Iran.
The ayatollah in Iran came out with a 

943
00:48:20,820 --> 00:48:23,110
proclamation that it was okay to have 
gender reassignment surgery.

944
00:48:23,290 --> 00:48:26,800
So it's not like traditional cultures 
don't know about this,

945
00:48:26,801 --> 00:48:28,480
it's not like we haven't made 
accommodation,

946
00:48:28,481 --> 00:48:33,481
it's always been an issues,
whether it's the [inaudible] and in 

947
00:48:33,481 --> 00:48:33,481
Thailand,
um,

948
00:48:33,481 --> 00:48:38,280
which are among the best spoken in most 
educated people that you meet as a 

949
00:48:38,280 --> 00:48:38,280
traveler.

950
00:48:38,280 --> 00:48:42,010
The issue is that we somehow wanted to 
make a wedge issue out of this.

951
00:48:42,070 --> 00:48:47,070
I am going to force you to say things 
that aren't true as an evidence of my 

952
00:48:47,070 --> 00:48:47,530
power as opposed to,
well,

953
00:48:47,531 --> 00:48:52,531
that's why exactly why I oppose the 
legislation in Canada to begin with 

954
00:48:52,531 --> 00:48:54,610
because part and parcel what came along 
with that as part and parcel of it,

955
00:48:54,611 --> 00:48:59,611
and this was no accident,
was illegal insistence that gender 

956
00:48:59,611 --> 00:49:02,260
differences were associated associate 
socio culturally constructed.

957
00:49:02,530 --> 00:49:03,760
It's like,
well they're not.

958
00:49:03,890 --> 00:49:04,720
And I thought,
well,

959
00:49:04,721 --> 00:49:09,721
what the hell?
Why are we enshrining that viewpoint 

960
00:49:09,721 --> 00:49:09,721
into law?
I mean,

961
00:49:09,721 --> 00:49:13,021
that's not to say that gender doesn't.
Very gender expression doesn't vary 

962
00:49:13,021 --> 00:49:15,880
substantially because of sociocultural 
conditions because you have to be a fool

963
00:49:15,881 --> 00:49:20,881
not to see that that's the case.
But that's another situation where the 

964
00:49:21,050 --> 00:49:26,050
multidimensional complexity seems to 
exceed the processing capacity of the 

965
00:49:26,050 --> 00:49:26,260
ideologues.

966
00:49:26,260 --> 00:49:28,030
Is that there's more than one factory 
work?

967
00:49:28,080 --> 00:49:28,350
No,
no,

968
00:49:28,351 --> 00:49:29,560
no.
They know what they're doing.

969
00:49:29,590 --> 00:49:34,590
Like for example,
should a skirt be seen as feminine or 

970
00:49:34,590 --> 00:49:34,960
masculine?
Well,

971
00:49:34,961 --> 00:49:39,961
we know from India where the lung is 
popular for Scotland where there's a 

972
00:49:39,961 --> 00:49:41,830
kilt that this is a variable.
In other words,

973
00:49:41,831 --> 00:49:44,410
you shouldn't hardcode skirts are for 
girls.

974
00:49:45,070 --> 00:49:50,070
Right?
And so the idea is that there is a huge 

975
00:49:50,070 --> 00:49:51,811
developmental aspect to learning.
Here are the assignments in your 

976
00:49:51,811 --> 00:49:56,551
culture.
Now at some point you want to steer 

977
00:49:56,551 --> 00:50:00,270
people into,
we have a huge interest in the breeding 

978
00:50:00,270 --> 00:50:05,131
family is the core of lineage in a 
society and we need to care both about 

979
00:50:06,760 --> 00:50:08,350
gays,
about um,

980
00:50:09,700 --> 00:50:13,120
people have uncertain gender,
non binary people,

981
00:50:13,150 --> 00:50:15,130
etc.
But we can't lose sight of the fact that

982
00:50:15,131 --> 00:50:18,670
we also have to care about the family,
the breeding family in distress,

983
00:50:19,020 --> 00:50:24,020
but also have to provide people with an 
easy pathway to a reasonably stable 

984
00:50:24,020 --> 00:50:24,020
identity.

985
00:50:24,020 --> 00:50:24,610
Well,
it doesn't confuse them too.

986
00:50:24,611 --> 00:50:29,611
This is the point is that they have an 
argument that I think we are learning 

987
00:50:29,611 --> 00:50:34,030
that gender and discomfort is far more 
common than we ever thought,

988
00:50:34,250 --> 00:50:39,250
although far less prevalent than the 
discussion seems to suggest you do have 

989
00:50:40,551 --> 00:50:45,551
a societal interest in steering people 
to roles if it's possiBle,

990
00:50:45,651 --> 00:50:50,651
but once somebody is like committedly 
nonbinary switch has to flip on us and 

991
00:50:50,841 --> 00:50:55,841
we have to become compassionate and 
recognize that we have a soul that we 

992
00:50:55,841 --> 00:50:57,770
have to take care of and we do have to 
make some allowances.

993
00:50:57,771 --> 00:51:02,771
If you,
if you know anybody who's intersex for 

994
00:51:02,771 --> 00:51:02,771
example,
you know,

995
00:51:02,771 --> 00:51:03,800
that it's a terrifying state,
that they face violence.

996
00:51:03,801 --> 00:51:04,510
I mean,
you know,

997
00:51:04,610 --> 00:51:09,610
why don't you see dudes kissing.
I always claim that it's the implied 

998
00:51:09,610 --> 00:51:10,730
threat of violence where if it makes 
people uncomfortable,

999
00:51:11,060 --> 00:51:13,520
um,
you don't see people holding hands quite

1000
00:51:13,521 --> 00:51:18,110
so comfortably and you don't see people 
being themselves.

1001
00:51:18,140 --> 00:51:19,940
So if we,
for example,

1002
00:51:20,390 --> 00:51:25,390
in the idw,
stood up for intersex and say this is 

1003
00:51:25,390 --> 00:51:29,261
the right way to do what you're doing,
I think it would be an absolute service 

1004
00:51:29,261 --> 00:51:29,510
to the world because that's something we
could push through.

1005
00:51:29,960 --> 00:51:34,960
I don't think that the key that the 
conservative christians in this country 

1006
00:51:35,240 --> 00:51:37,340
are going to have a diehard,
they're gonna feel like,

1007
00:51:37,341 --> 00:51:39,620
well,
if the lord made people in that way,

1008
00:51:39,621 --> 00:51:42,380
we have to accept all the products of 
god's creation.

1009
00:51:43,580 --> 00:51:45,860
Where do you fall on that?
Because this is where people will say,

1010
00:51:45,861 --> 00:51:46,040
well,
yeah,

1011
00:51:46,340 --> 00:51:49,340
was against trans people and gay people.
I mean all the,

1012
00:51:49,341 --> 00:51:50,660
all the nonsense.
Yeah.

1013
00:51:50,661 --> 00:51:52,700
Well then I hear about your situation in
Canada.

1014
00:51:52,701 --> 00:51:57,701
It was quite clear is that the federal 
government following the provincial 

1015
00:51:57,701 --> 00:52:01,031
governments decided that it was okay to 
impose requirements for the regulation 

1016
00:52:01,031 --> 00:52:04,961
of speech.
And I didn't care what the reason for 

1017
00:52:04,961 --> 00:52:07,571
that was.
I thought that it was a terrible 

1018
00:52:07,571 --> 00:52:09,320
legislative move and partly not because 
it wasn't only compelled speech.

1019
00:52:09,710 --> 00:52:14,710
I read the policy guidelines that were 
the framework within which this bill was

1020
00:52:14,781 --> 00:52:19,781
to be interpreted.
There's pages and pages of them all on 

1021
00:52:19,781 --> 00:52:19,781
the ontario human rights commission 
website,

1022
00:52:19,781 --> 00:52:21,520
which was late to the federal website,
um,

1023
00:52:21,830 --> 00:52:26,830
where they had announced how this bill 
would be interpreted and it contained 

1024
00:52:26,830 --> 00:52:30,341
all sorts of terrible things.
Like the insistence that gender was was 

1025
00:52:30,341 --> 00:52:34,391
a social socio cultural construct and 
it's in part a socio cultural construct 

1026
00:52:34,851 --> 00:52:39,851
and these things are this,
you cannot do that because all of a 

1027
00:52:39,851 --> 00:52:44,231
sudden the legislation seemed to imply 
that at discussion about the biological 

1028
00:52:44,231 --> 00:52:48,521
differences between men and women might 
be regarded as hate speech and I also 

1029
00:52:48,521 --> 00:52:50,390
think we're a fair ways along that 
pathway in Canada.

1030
00:52:50,960 --> 00:52:55,960
So I don't think that my fears about the
bill were unwarranted and I think that 

1031
00:52:55,960 --> 00:53:00,131
what happened at wilfrid laurier 
university is an absolutely perfect 

1032
00:53:00,131 --> 00:53:03,251
example of that.
So I think that my stance on that piece 

1033
00:53:03,251 --> 00:53:03,740
of legislation was substantively 
correct.

1034
00:53:04,040 --> 00:53:09,040
Now the problem is is that or,
or the the treachery that was involved 

1035
00:53:09,201 --> 00:53:14,201
in the bill because I see the bill as an
attempt by the radical left to gain 

1036
00:53:14,201 --> 00:53:17,681
linguistic dominance over increasing 
linguistic dominance over the 

1037
00:53:17,681 --> 00:53:21,341
conversation as a whole.
Using trans people as the sacrificial 

1038
00:53:21,341 --> 00:53:21,770
victims.
And by the way,

1039
00:53:21,920 --> 00:53:26,100
I got no shortage of letters from trans 
people saying I not so happy being

1040
00:53:26,100 --> 00:53:30,840
you used as a sacrificial victim for the
left to advance its linguistic hegemony.

1041
00:53:30,950 --> 00:53:35,950
I got a lot more letters like that from 
trans people than I did from trans 

1042
00:53:35,950 --> 00:53:36,720
people criticizing what I did.
So.

1043
00:53:36,721 --> 00:53:40,410
And I also think that this would have 
all died away very rapidly if all it was

1044
00:53:40,411 --> 00:53:44,700
about was one professor's objection to 
the rights of trans people that had very

1045
00:53:44,701 --> 00:53:47,250
little to do with it.
But let's just take this,

1046
00:53:47,640 --> 00:53:50,760
take this bull by the horns right now.
Am I correct?

1047
00:53:50,910 --> 00:53:52,620
And I,
you and I have not discussed this.

1048
00:53:53,100 --> 00:53:58,100
That your point would be the law is the 
wrong place to do it and the culture 

1049
00:53:58,100 --> 00:54:00,000
would be the right place.
Absolutely.

1050
00:54:00,480 --> 00:54:02,610
has to be bottom up like the ms thing 
was.

1051
00:54:02,611 --> 00:54:07,611
I understand that.
so my point is law is absolutely the 

1052
00:54:07,611 --> 00:54:07,611
wrong.
Why not let it come from us.

1053
00:54:07,611 --> 00:54:08,460
I mean,
in other words,

1054
00:54:08,520 --> 00:54:12,210
this thing has been so crazily 
interpreted by the press.

1055
00:54:12,250 --> 00:54:16,170
This is absolute malpractice as far as 
I'm concerned by our journal.

1056
00:54:16,200 --> 00:54:20,630
This journal agentic malpractice.
I should,

1057
00:54:20,760 --> 00:54:25,760
I should speak up for some of the 
journalists in Canada because the post 

1058
00:54:25,760 --> 00:54:27,990
media group is 200 newspapers came out 
and supportive my stance.

1059
00:54:27,991 --> 00:54:30,580
So I appreciate those who aren't doing,
but my point is,

1060
00:54:30,590 --> 00:54:34,890
is that the fact that we're still having
to discuss this as a tax on all kinds of

1061
00:54:34,891 --> 00:54:39,891
discussion,
that the more time I have to spend 

1062
00:54:39,891 --> 00:54:39,891
saying I'm not all right,
uh,

1063
00:54:40,250 --> 00:54:41,920
you know,
transphobic,

1064
00:54:41,960 --> 00:54:46,960
I don't want the fact that I'm in an 
interracial marriage because I oppose 

1065
00:54:46,981 --> 00:54:50,910
these equity proposals that are complete
abomination.

1066
00:54:51,040 --> 00:54:56,040
Right?
It remember when you and I were in 

1067
00:54:56,040 --> 00:54:58,311
tempe,
Arizona at the comedy club and I said 

1068
00:54:58,311 --> 00:54:58,311
something like,
you know,

1069
00:54:58,311 --> 00:55:02,480
we shouldn't be celebrating this.
I'm in an interracial marriage and 

1070
00:55:02,480 --> 00:55:02,730
everybody clapping,
I said,

1071
00:55:02,940 --> 00:55:03,510
stop it.

1072
00:55:04,080 --> 00:55:07,020
Unless a feW of you are admissions 
officers to ivy league schools,

1073
00:55:07,021 --> 00:55:10,130
in which case we'll talk to you later.
But the point is a terrible thing.

1074
00:55:10,430 --> 00:55:15,430
Credit for that,
like you happen to fall in love with a 

1075
00:55:15,430 --> 00:55:17,060
person of color,
is there's moral victory.

1076
00:55:17,380 --> 00:55:22,380
Lord,
is there a metal you know in your 

1077
00:55:22,380 --> 00:55:22,380
future,
you don't want it.

1078
00:55:22,380 --> 00:55:23,040
Now what I'm trying to say something 
slightly different,

1079
00:55:23,190 --> 00:55:28,190
which is I want in on the positive 
aspects of the social transformation.

1080
00:55:29,310 --> 00:55:34,260
I know that my intersex people are 
hurting and I know that trans people,

1081
00:55:34,520 --> 00:55:39,520
um,
are present in every culture without 

1082
00:55:39,520 --> 00:55:42,141
this social justice stuff,
and we should be spearheading what the 

1083
00:55:42,141 --> 00:55:43,920
incompetent progressive,
left can't get done.

1084
00:55:44,330 --> 00:55:46,440
WhaT is that?
is that what we're doing?

1085
00:55:46,650 --> 00:55:48,120
One of the things that I want to be 
doing,

1086
00:55:48,140 --> 00:55:53,070
like gay marriage turned on a dime over 
a very short period of time,

1087
00:55:53,071 --> 00:55:54,330
like smoking,
right?

1088
00:55:54,360 --> 00:55:57,330
Somehow that there's no smoking in bars.
It's almost incredible.

1089
00:55:57,750 --> 00:55:59,390
You know,
if you're old enough to think about that

1090
00:55:59,580 --> 00:56:04,580
we should be spearheading this thing 
because they can't get the job done and 

1091
00:56:04,580 --> 00:56:05,760
what is our point?
Not in law yet,

1092
00:56:05,820 --> 00:56:08,070
not in law,
but do it in culture.

1093
00:56:08,790 --> 00:56:12,060
You can't have everybody do his or her 
own pronouns,

1094
00:56:12,061 --> 00:56:15,540
which is an absolute disaster.
But we could settle on,

1095
00:56:15,710 --> 00:56:16,620
you know,
and you could do,

1096
00:56:16,621 --> 00:56:17,610
hey,
hey,

1097
00:56:17,700 --> 00:56:18,900
and they,
you know,

1098
00:56:18,960 --> 00:56:21,120
pronouns or something like this.
I don't know what the right thing.

1099
00:56:21,121 --> 00:56:24,370
Get a linguist and a to figure out the 
minimally intrusive

1100
00:56:24,400 --> 00:56:27,450
one time backwards,
incompatible change to the language Is,

1101
00:56:27,470 --> 00:56:29,310
it's going to be painful.
Uh,

1102
00:56:29,340 --> 00:56:31,870
I'm not looking forward to it,
but we could get it done.

1103
00:56:32,610 --> 00:56:37,610
So one of the things that I've been 
doing in my public lectures is talking 

1104
00:56:37,610 --> 00:56:40,150
about the appropriate and responsible 
position of the left.

1105
00:56:40,930 --> 00:56:45,930
So you know,
it seems to me that if you're pursuing 

1106
00:56:46,840 --> 00:56:50,950
goals that have value,
which you have to do because you have to

1107
00:56:50,951 --> 00:56:53,920
do things in order to stay alive,
you have to pursue goals of value.

1108
00:56:53,921 --> 00:56:56,980
If you do that in a social social space,
which you're compelled to do,

1109
00:56:57,310 --> 00:56:59,140
then you're going to produce hierarchies
because people,

1110
00:56:59,141 --> 00:57:04,141
different incompetence and you actually 
want to produce hierarchies that are 

1111
00:57:04,141 --> 00:57:07,201
based on competence because they're 
efficient tools for getting that 

1112
00:57:07,201 --> 00:57:10,801
particular job done.
And so it's a reasonable position for 

1113
00:57:10,801 --> 00:57:14,611
people on the,
in the center and on the right to say 

1114
00:57:14,611 --> 00:57:14,611
stand behind the hierarchies.

1115
00:57:14,611 --> 00:57:19,140
But by the same token,
hierarchies can tilt towards a 

1116
00:57:19,140 --> 00:57:23,401
corruption and tyranny and they tend to 
dispossess people because talents are 

1117
00:57:23,401 --> 00:57:24,520
distributed on equally.
So the left,

1118
00:57:24,970 --> 00:57:27,430
the position of the left,
that's the appropriate position,

1119
00:57:27,670 --> 00:57:30,340
is to speak up for the dispossessed,
to keep the,

1120
00:57:30,590 --> 00:57:34,150
is flexible enough so that they don't 
turn into tyranny and so then you have a

1121
00:57:34,151 --> 00:57:39,151
dialogue between the right and the left 
that's necessary to maintain the 

1122
00:57:39,151 --> 00:57:42,481
hierarchy,
but also to prune it and keep it 

1123
00:57:42,481 --> 00:57:44,671
healthy.
And so one of the things that we could 

1124
00:57:44,671 --> 00:57:47,881
conceivably contribute to is to improve 
the health as you're pointing out 

1125
00:57:47,950 --> 00:57:50,470
conceptually and otherwise of the 
dialogue on the left,

1126
00:57:50,890 --> 00:57:52,930
it's like to give the devil his due,
so to speak.

1127
00:57:53,080 --> 00:57:56,560
And to say that of course there's a 
place for the left.

1128
00:57:56,830 --> 00:58:01,830
The question is when do they go too far?
Which is what I've been trying to push 

1129
00:58:01,830 --> 00:58:01,830
to be a moderate.

1130
00:58:01,830 --> 00:58:03,790
So think about this.
This is beyond communism.

1131
00:58:03,970 --> 00:58:07,870
If you think about one phrase that sums 
up the theory of communism,

1132
00:58:07,871 --> 00:58:12,871
what would you,
what would you say with the most famous 

1133
00:58:12,871 --> 00:58:12,871
for it?
Well,

1134
00:58:12,871 --> 00:58:14,080
probably from each according to their 
ability to each according to their need.

1135
00:58:14,081 --> 00:58:19,081
And I'll look at the first part of that 
phrase from each according to their 

1136
00:58:19,081 --> 00:58:19,081
ability.
Right?

1137
00:58:19,081 --> 00:58:22,920
So the idea is that there are different 
abilities acknowledged in the very core 

1138
00:58:22,920 --> 00:58:25,060
of communism beyond that,
right?

1139
00:58:25,120 --> 00:58:26,230
Right.
Oh yes.

1140
00:58:26,330 --> 00:58:27,640
I that.
Well,

1141
00:58:27,670 --> 00:58:32,670
I think the most pathological,
the deepest unidimensional pathology 

1142
00:58:32,921 --> 00:58:37,900
that characterizes the radical left is 
actually an attack on competence itself.

1143
00:58:38,440 --> 00:58:41,890
And so when I was at the aspen ideas 
festival a couple of days ago,

1144
00:58:42,310 --> 00:58:44,350
I made the case that,
um,

1145
00:58:44,860 --> 00:58:46,730
our hierarchies in the west are 
determined to,

1146
00:58:46,740 --> 00:58:49,930
at least in part by competence right 
now,

1147
00:58:49,960 --> 00:58:52,930
the degree to which it's pure competence
can be disputed,

1148
00:58:52,931 --> 00:58:56,830
but intelligence and conscientiousness 
are the best predictors of longterm life

1149
00:58:56,831 --> 00:58:58,990
success,
even though they don't predict more than

1150
00:58:58,991 --> 00:59:03,991
about 25 percent of the variance.
But the buzz surrounding what I said was

1151
00:59:04,181 --> 00:59:09,181
that Jordan Peterson is validating the 
current patriarchy by making the radical

1152
00:59:09,671 --> 00:59:11,800
claim that it's predicated on 
competence.

1153
00:59:12,060 --> 00:59:12,880
It's like,
well,

1154
00:59:12,881 --> 00:59:14,770
why would they twist that argument?
Because they didn't want.

1155
00:59:14,771 --> 00:59:19,771
I said,
I said that their competence is a 

1156
00:59:19,771 --> 00:59:20,530
partial contributor to our successful 
hierarchies.

1157
00:59:20,680 --> 00:59:22,010
And I think the reason is,
is

1158
00:59:22,010 --> 00:59:27,010
that the very idea of differential 
competence is unacceptable to the most 

1159
00:59:27,010 --> 00:59:31,661
radical will hang on for his left.
Let's look at two separate systems 

1160
00:59:31,661 --> 00:59:33,320
because I think that what people do is 
they focus on one rather than the other,

1161
00:59:33,330 --> 00:59:36,530
and I've had to learn how to do this.
If we look at chess,

1162
00:59:36,531 --> 00:59:41,531
which can be made blind where you don't 
know who you're playing across the 

1163
00:59:41,531 --> 00:59:45,521
internet,
and we look at musical additions for 

1164
00:59:45,521 --> 00:59:45,830
classical orchestras,
uh,

1165
00:59:45,860 --> 00:59:50,860
where you can put people behind a screen
and I think this became popular in the 

1166
00:59:50,860 --> 00:59:50,990
eighties,
nineties,

1167
00:59:50,991 --> 00:59:55,991
a particular basis who is also a 
psychologist may have been instrumental 

1168
00:59:55,991 --> 00:59:57,890
in getting this change.
When you introduced the screen,

1169
00:59:59,330 --> 01:00:02,150
women's participation in orchestras went
up,

1170
01:00:03,110 --> 01:00:06,200
right?
So it was a very positive social program

1171
01:00:06,201 --> 01:00:11,201
because competency was apparently being 
suppressed by people's perception,

1172
01:00:12,140 --> 01:00:14,330
by prejudice.
It was a structural problem.

1173
01:00:14,570 --> 01:00:16,940
Now maybe it didn't go as far as people 
won't want it,

1174
01:00:16,970 --> 01:00:18,320
maybe didn't get to 50 slash 50.

1175
01:00:18,320 --> 01:00:20,360
I don't know what the stats are.
I can look in on that.

1176
01:00:20,780 --> 01:00:25,780
When you do it in chess,
I don't believe it has a positive 

1177
01:00:25,780 --> 01:00:25,940
effect.
When they did it in the australian civil

1178
01:00:25,941 --> 01:00:28,790
service for blind cvs,
it had the opposite effect.

1179
01:00:28,791 --> 01:00:31,060
Women got under selected right?
So,

1180
01:00:31,061 --> 01:00:36,061
so you're saying even though you're 
saying is that this is situationally 

1181
01:00:36,061 --> 01:00:36,390
situations.
The point is,

1182
01:00:36,391 --> 01:00:38,570
is that the people who want to talk 
about chess,

1183
01:00:38,580 --> 01:00:43,580
where the top hundred players last I 
checked it was 99 to one male to female,

1184
01:00:44,300 --> 01:00:47,660
which is so like even with structural 
bigotry,

1185
01:00:48,710 --> 01:00:50,600
man,
that's hard to explain.

1186
01:00:52,880 --> 01:00:57,250
In the other case of the classical 
orchestras at what was it?

1187
01:00:57,251 --> 01:00:59,540
Twenty percent increased participation 
of females.

1188
01:00:59,600 --> 01:01:02,270
That's a giant amount and they're both 
true.

1189
01:01:02,810 --> 01:01:07,070
And so the problem is when you push 
everything and you shove it into the low

1190
01:01:07,071 --> 01:01:12,071
dimensional space,
you have this idea of is this structural

1191
01:01:12,730 --> 01:01:16,580
a misrepresentation or is it something 
else?

1192
01:01:16,730 --> 01:01:21,730
Well,
it's both and it's situationally 

1193
01:01:21,730 --> 01:01:21,730
dependent.
My wife had to make a point to me,

1194
01:01:21,730 --> 01:01:26,711
which I was blind to because in physics 
almost nothing matters other than like 

1195
01:01:27,290 --> 01:01:30,470
horsepower and creativity.
You don't care whether somebody red,

1196
01:01:30,471 --> 01:01:31,040
green,
blue,

1197
01:01:31,041 --> 01:01:31,850
male,
female.

1198
01:01:32,180 --> 01:01:34,880
it's just like almost nobody's got 
interesting ideas.

1199
01:01:34,910 --> 01:01:37,700
It's so hard to make any progress 
whatsoever.

1200
01:01:38,450 --> 01:01:43,450
You just want to take the far right tail
of the distribution and you don't want 

1201
01:01:43,450 --> 01:01:44,090
to be harassed about anything other than
that.

1202
01:01:44,650 --> 01:01:46,020
Math,
math,

1203
01:01:46,090 --> 01:01:48,820
math,
math is potentially even more.

1204
01:01:51,410 --> 01:01:52,610
My wife had to say to me,
you know,

1205
01:01:52,620 --> 01:01:57,620
eric,
not everything looks like theoretical 

1206
01:01:57,620 --> 01:01:57,620
physics or differential geometry.
In fact,

1207
01:01:57,620 --> 01:02:01,811
if you think about community policing,
it can be extremely important to have 

1208
01:02:01,811 --> 01:02:06,161
diversity a because why do you want one 
ethnic group policing another ethnic 

1209
01:02:07,701 --> 01:02:12,701
group or all cops being male?
you want diversity in order to have good

1210
01:02:12,711 --> 01:02:17,711
relations so that people see themselves 
reflected on the force and if there is 

1211
01:02:17,711 --> 01:02:19,410
bigotry and prejudice,
it manifests itself.

1212
01:02:19,550 --> 01:02:22,620
Uh,
it's harder to manifest if people are in

1213
01:02:22,621 --> 01:02:24,750
fact diverse.
So that was a bit of a wake up call.

1214
01:02:24,751 --> 01:02:29,751
The other thing that came from the 
harvard math department where it for a 

1215
01:02:29,751 --> 01:02:33,141
period of time,
it appeared that they would let in one 

1216
01:02:33,141 --> 01:02:34,941
woman a year into the phd program and 
then she would have a terrible year and 

1217
01:02:34,941 --> 01:02:39,501
she dropped out and then one year a 
woman deferred her admission and so they

1218
01:02:40,500 --> 01:02:45,500
added another woman and then she had two
women in the first year and the two of 

1219
01:02:45,500 --> 01:02:47,160
them reinforced each other's reality.

1220
01:02:47,160 --> 01:02:47,600
Like,
you know,

1221
01:02:47,630 --> 01:02:52,630
I think I just said something and 
everybody ignored it or I made a point 

1222
01:02:52,630 --> 01:02:55,971
and then somebody else went to the 
chalkboard and wrote it down as if it 

1223
01:02:55,971 --> 01:02:58,641
was his idea and this group of two women
stayed in the program and that meant the

1224
01:02:59,820 --> 01:03:01,110
next year that there was one woman lead 
in,

1225
01:03:01,150 --> 01:03:02,670
okay,
now there's a group of three,

1226
01:03:03,060 --> 01:03:08,060
and that was a situation in which there 
was an organic change in the apparent 

1227
01:03:08,060 --> 01:03:12,801
ability of women.
Now we need to be differentiating.

1228
01:03:14,040 --> 01:03:18,720
we can't keep reacting to the madness of
the analysis.

1229
01:03:18,830 --> 01:03:19,650
Right?
Right.

1230
01:03:19,680 --> 01:03:22,020
We can't.
We have to be the ones who are saying,

1231
01:03:22,021 --> 01:03:22,230
look,

1232
01:03:24,260 --> 01:03:24,950
let me steal,
man.

1233
01:03:24,980 --> 01:03:27,080
Your point.
You're making a terrible version of this

1234
01:03:27,081 --> 01:03:28,850
argument.
I think I can even do better.

1235
01:03:28,851 --> 01:03:30,810
And you're welcome.
Right?

1236
01:03:31,670 --> 01:03:34,850
Because the other thing it's doing is 
it's deranging our conversation.

1237
01:03:34,851 --> 01:03:39,851
This is why I had you talked to ben.
Ask him point blank about whether he 

1238
01:03:39,851 --> 01:03:41,570
would use the pronouns.
And his point was,

1239
01:03:42,220 --> 01:03:47,220
I will in general be happy to use 
somebody preferred program except if 

1240
01:03:47,220 --> 01:03:50,801
we're discussing a trans issues,
which in which case it is to see the 

1241
01:03:50,801 --> 01:03:55,511
argument that he doesn't want to 
publicly see the argument for privately 

1242
01:03:56,270 --> 01:04:01,270
mystic grounds open about it and this is
what we have to stop reacting to the 

1243
01:04:02,631 --> 01:04:03,380
mat,
to,

1244
01:04:03,410 --> 01:04:08,410
to the crazy making substrate.
So basically you think that for the 

1245
01:04:08,410 --> 01:04:12,071
people that are keeping their foot on 
the pedal at the highest possible level,

1246
01:04:12,530 --> 01:04:14,360
we sort of just have to let that go.

1247
01:04:14,570 --> 01:04:17,620
But do you think it would be enough?
So if let's say tomorrow you started,

1248
01:04:18,050 --> 01:04:19,550
we finished the show today and you say,
all right,

1249
01:04:19,551 --> 01:04:21,640
I'm going to start being the champion 
for all the.

1250
01:04:21,850 --> 01:04:26,850
The compassion that trans people.
I mean I know you're compassionate to 

1251
01:04:26,850 --> 01:04:29,591
all people,
but I'm going to be publicly more 

1252
01:04:29,591 --> 01:04:32,351
compassionate to trans people and 
intersex people and all of and address 

1253
01:04:32,351 --> 01:04:32,351
all of the issues that you just brought 
up.

1254
01:04:32,351 --> 01:04:35,030
If there's another set of people that 
are never gonna,

1255
01:04:35,360 --> 01:04:40,360
throw you a bone on that,
that are never going to give you a 

1256
01:04:40,360 --> 01:04:43,931
little outreach on that.
Does it actually do anything or you 

1257
01:04:43,931 --> 01:04:46,871
think it just allows us to get the 
refugees that will kind of wake up 

1258
01:04:46,871 --> 01:04:50,380
around it.
But I think that we're being drained of 

1259
01:04:50,380 --> 01:04:50,380
our empathy.
I mean,

1260
01:04:50,380 --> 01:04:53,260
let me,
let me say I am being drained of my 

1261
01:04:53,260 --> 01:04:53,260
empathy.
Um,

1262
01:04:53,260 --> 01:04:53,260
you know,
there was a,

1263
01:04:53,300 --> 01:04:58,300
there was a tweet that Kentucky planned 
parenthood put out where it was one of 

1264
01:04:58,300 --> 01:04:59,450
these.
Remember it was,

1265
01:04:59,451 --> 01:05:00,890
uh,
some,

1266
01:05:00,920 --> 01:05:05,700
some men have have a uterus and they 
repeated it like 11 times.

1267
01:05:05,750 --> 01:05:06,710
Yeah,
that's the big thing.

1268
01:05:06,740 --> 01:05:07,200
And

1269
01:05:08,930 --> 01:05:13,930
if they've written,
some trans men have a uterus or if 

1270
01:05:13,930 --> 01:05:17,771
they'd written something,
but we have to be compassionate to 

1271
01:05:17,771 --> 01:05:18,880
people who as what,
whatever.

1272
01:05:19,120 --> 01:05:20,950
I would be okay.
But the idea of some men have you.

1273
01:05:20,980 --> 01:05:25,980
Well,
there's actually something called 

1274
01:05:25,980 --> 01:05:27,660
persistent mullerian duct syndrome where
people who were phenotypically male at 

1275
01:05:27,660 --> 01:05:31,510
birth appear to have a uterus because of
the mysteries of development.

1276
01:05:31,520 --> 01:05:36,520
And again,
the fact that males and females are one 

1277
01:05:36,520 --> 01:05:38,911
protein away from each other and 
treating each other like we're separate 

1278
01:05:38,911 --> 01:05:40,300
tribes as opposed to,
um,

1279
01:05:40,810 --> 01:05:45,810
you know,
fisher like compliments is absolutely 

1280
01:05:45,810 --> 01:05:47,890
insane.
And so I find myself making fun of these

1281
01:05:47,891 --> 01:05:50,170
people and I had some tweet about,
you know,

1282
01:05:50,710 --> 01:05:55,710
either we're talking about persistent 
mullerian duct syndrome or you're just 

1283
01:05:55,710 --> 01:05:56,440
eating crayons,
helping pooping a rainbow.

1284
01:05:57,040 --> 01:05:58,120
And,
you know,

1285
01:05:58,121 --> 01:06:03,121
I thought about this,
I thought I'm so unsympathetic with 

1286
01:06:03,121 --> 01:06:05,710
you're trying to smuggle ideology into 
my world,

1287
01:06:05,750 --> 01:06:09,170
into compassion to the laboratory and 
you know,

1288
01:06:09,220 --> 01:06:14,220
this is reprehensible ideology under the
guise of it just gets back to this issue

1289
01:06:14,411 --> 01:06:18,250
that we have been having this expert 
conversation in the literature where all

1290
01:06:18,251 --> 01:06:22,750
sorts of things that cause people to 
clutch pros and they're feigning couches

1291
01:06:22,960 --> 01:06:27,960
are absolutely parts of the parts of the
literature and biology and psychology 

1292
01:06:28,721 --> 01:06:31,120
and anthropology,
all of these places.

1293
01:06:31,180 --> 01:06:34,690
And now everything is discussed 
everywhere.

1294
01:06:34,720 --> 01:06:39,720
So when you hear,
you know that there are group 

1295
01:06:39,720 --> 01:06:39,720
differences,
um,

1296
01:06:39,730 --> 01:06:44,730
it's shocking if you haven't been part 
of the professional civil conversation.

1297
01:06:45,580 --> 01:06:47,620
And I think that that's a big problem 
is,

1298
01:06:47,621 --> 01:06:51,040
is that this is this esoteric versus 
exoteric speak,

1299
01:06:51,041 --> 01:06:56,041
which is the sort of intellectual elite 
in the universities have this private 

1300
01:06:57,821 --> 01:07:02,821
way of talking amongst themselves in 
journals and in this public way of 

1301
01:07:02,821 --> 01:07:05,290
talking,
and this is absolutely essential in some

1302
01:07:05,291 --> 01:07:06,820
areas,
but it's being abused and others.

1303
01:07:06,821 --> 01:07:07,690
So,
for example,

1304
01:07:07,691 --> 01:07:09,900
the trade theorists,
um,

1305
01:07:10,210 --> 01:07:12,170
know that,
what they talk about,

1306
01:07:12,210 --> 01:07:15,490
that the importance of free trade based 
on ricardian equivalence and comparative

1307
01:07:15,491 --> 01:07:18,930
advantage is a bullshit argument.
Um,

1308
01:07:19,160 --> 01:07:22,930
it's a very crude thing that's very hard
to argue with mathematically,

1309
01:07:22,960 --> 01:07:27,960
but it's behind the scenes.
They're having a completely different 

1310
01:07:27,960 --> 01:07:28,750
conversation and they have the idea of 
we're entitled to do this.

1311
01:07:28,780 --> 01:07:33,780
And the answer from my perspective is 
you just replaced one concept which was 

1312
01:07:33,971 --> 01:07:36,250
a caldor hicks,
uh,

1313
01:07:36,640 --> 01:07:38,050
improvement with,
uh,

1314
01:07:38,110 --> 01:07:43,110
with paredo improvement.
Pereno improvement makes everybody 

1315
01:07:43,110 --> 01:07:45,961
better off.
Tyler hicks leave some people worse off 

1316
01:07:45,961 --> 01:07:48,701
than some people better off.
And you'd have to tax the better off to 

1317
01:07:48,701 --> 01:07:48,701
compensate for the worst at.
Well,

1318
01:07:48,701 --> 01:07:52,680
we're,
we're having a countrywide freakout 

1319
01:07:52,680 --> 01:07:54,760
because the economists have developed 
two separate conversations,

1320
01:07:54,761 --> 01:07:58,540
one for the public where they push out 
things that are not necessarily good for

1321
01:07:58,541 --> 01:08:03,541
the median individual,
very bad for particular communities and 

1322
01:08:03,541 --> 01:08:08,460
a separate conversation that they're 
having amongst themselves and they are 

1323
01:08:08,460 --> 01:08:09,640
serving these interests.
What we have to do,

1324
01:08:09,641 --> 01:08:11,800
something about this,
we can no longer.

1325
01:08:11,801 --> 01:08:14,560
This goes back to your gutenberg point 
and the technology issue.

1326
01:08:14,930 --> 01:08:19,930
We cannot have this level of division 
between the private and the public 

1327
01:08:19,930 --> 01:08:24,251
conversation.
I know more about what's wrong with the 

1328
01:08:24,251 --> 01:08:24,251
immigration,
uh,

1329
01:08:24,251 --> 01:08:26,210
in the high tech sector than the 
national academy feels.

1330
01:08:26,270 --> 01:08:28,970
A national academy of sciences wants to 
discuss.

1331
01:08:28,971 --> 01:08:33,971
They are at the center effectively of a 
conspiracy in the 19 eighties and early 

1332
01:08:34,341 --> 01:08:39,341
nineties to change the laws of the 
United States in order to make it 

1333
01:08:39,341 --> 01:08:43,961
impossible for young scientists to 
bargain with phds in hand with their 

1334
01:08:43,961 --> 01:08:46,850
employers to get the six figure salaries
that the market was going to give.

1335
01:08:47,420 --> 01:08:52,420
Now we can,
we can play a game where the national is

1336
01:08:52,881 --> 01:08:57,881
having a private conversation with me 
where they've had me four or five times 

1337
01:08:57,881 --> 01:09:00,710
over there and they're not going to have
any reflection of this in the public,

1338
01:09:01,010 --> 01:09:06,010
but I now have 100,000
twitter followers and I know why people 

1339
01:09:06,010 --> 01:09:08,270
are angry about immigration,
has nothing to do with immigrants.

1340
01:09:08,420 --> 01:09:13,420
It has to do with transfer.
It has to do with the fact that our 

1341
01:09:13,420 --> 01:09:17,141
ruling classes had been figuring out how
to transfer money from one group of 

1342
01:09:17,141 --> 01:09:18,860
americans to another group of americans 
and if they could use puppies,

1343
01:09:19,580 --> 01:09:22,040
they use puppies because you can't 
object puppies.

1344
01:09:22,460 --> 01:09:25,370
Okay,
well the problem is is that you now have

1345
01:09:25,371 --> 01:09:28,310
a group of people who are able to have 
these conversations to say,

1346
01:09:28,311 --> 01:09:33,311
let me show you the playbook.
Let me show you what's really going on 

1347
01:09:33,311 --> 01:09:34,530
on in these technical discussions.
There are,

1348
01:09:34,540 --> 01:09:37,040
there are differences between groups 
that are measurable.

1349
01:09:37,070 --> 01:09:38,520
Iq,
w,

1350
01:09:38,810 --> 01:09:43,810
I don't think any of us really want to 
be talking about race and iq 

1351
01:09:43,810 --> 01:09:46,601
particularly,
but when you try to say there is 

1352
01:09:46,601 --> 01:09:49,100
absolutely no evidence to show,
well that's not going to be true and the

1353
01:09:49,101 --> 01:09:51,050
scientists are going to have to say,
look,

1354
01:09:51,590 --> 01:09:53,540
I don't,
I don't right.

1355
01:09:53,541 --> 01:09:56,270
Reality,
I report on what the literature says.

1356
01:09:56,271 --> 01:09:57,920
Let me tell you what the literature 
says,

1357
01:09:57,921 --> 01:10:00,410
and the literature says some things that
we don't want it to say,

1358
01:10:00,920 --> 01:10:03,650
but that's not.
There's nothing new about that.

1359
01:10:03,830 --> 01:10:07,820
Lots of science is very upsetting.
Evolutionary theory is upsetting.

1360
01:10:08,630 --> 01:10:11,930
Psychology is upsetting and it's 
upsetting literature.

1361
01:10:11,931 --> 01:10:15,950
We haven't figured out what we're going 
to do culturally as it becomes available

1362
01:10:15,951 --> 01:10:20,951
to everybody and we have people who are 
sort of gleefully talking about things 

1363
01:10:20,951 --> 01:10:22,560
like race and iq and I want to tell 
them,

1364
01:10:22,640 --> 01:10:23,480
cut it out.
That's the,

1365
01:10:23,650 --> 01:10:28,650
you know,
we don't really know everything but 

1366
01:10:28,650 --> 01:10:28,790
we're getting more and more knowledge 
and I'm worried about where it can go.

1367
01:10:29,450 --> 01:10:31,250
And we have other groups of people who 
say,

1368
01:10:31,860 --> 01:10:36,860
you know,
there's absolutely nothing to this race 

1369
01:10:36,860 --> 01:10:36,860
and iq thing.
I'm just thinking,

1370
01:10:36,860 --> 01:10:37,260
oh,
this is like as best as you're,

1371
01:10:37,270 --> 01:10:42,270
you're,
you're now making an attempt to stir up 

1372
01:10:42,270 --> 01:10:45,041
the asbestos to try to get rid of it and
you're going to loosen all these fibers 

1373
01:10:45,041 --> 01:10:47,150
rather than doing this professionally 
and scientifically the right way,

1374
01:10:47,151 --> 01:10:49,280
so I do think that there's an issue 
about the esoteric,

1375
01:10:49,281 --> 01:10:54,281
the exoteric and what it is that we're 
going to do as experts to handle the 

1376
01:10:54,281 --> 01:10:58,841
knowledge that we've been sort of 
exposed to and that the public hasn't 

1377
01:10:59,061 --> 01:11:04,061
and it's coming out in the worst ways 
and this is part of what's fueling the 

1378
01:11:04,061 --> 01:11:04,061
whole.
Make America great again.

1379
01:11:04,110 --> 01:11:09,110
Situation,
which is the public knows something is 

1380
01:11:09,110 --> 01:11:11,831
off with their expert communities.
The expert communities are not being 

1381
01:11:11,831 --> 01:11:14,250
honest about what the literature,
so I would say that right

1382
01:11:14,250 --> 01:11:19,250
there is the magic of what I've been.
It's been such a pleasure of being part 

1383
01:11:19,321 --> 01:11:24,321
of with you for these last two months or
so that you are giving people a little 

1384
01:11:24,321 --> 01:11:26,610
bit of all of these people know 
something's not right.

1385
01:11:26,611 --> 01:11:28,620
The information we're getting is not 
right.

1386
01:11:28,621 --> 01:11:30,330
The language we're speaking is not 
right.

1387
01:11:30,630 --> 01:11:32,640
The way we're talking about government 
is not right.

1388
01:11:32,670 --> 01:11:34,260
Everything that eric just said right 
there,

1389
01:11:34,440 --> 01:11:39,440
and you're giving them a little room 
every day to figure it out for 

1390
01:11:39,440 --> 01:11:39,980
themselves.
That,

1391
01:11:40,080 --> 01:11:42,120
that strikes me.
Two things that are happening.

1392
01:11:42,121 --> 01:11:47,121
One is because of the long form,
it's actually possible to have more in 

1393
01:11:47,121 --> 01:11:51,171
depth discussions about these things.
And the other is that because my 

1394
01:11:51,171 --> 01:11:51,180
lectures,
let's say,

1395
01:11:51,181 --> 01:11:56,070
and the discussions that I've been 
having focus on the development of ideas

1396
01:11:56,071 --> 01:11:59,820
rather than on the ideas themselves,
but that gives people a bit of breathing

1397
01:11:59,821 --> 01:12:00,330
space.

1398
01:12:00,900 --> 01:12:05,900
Um,
one of the questions that I'm really 

1399
01:12:05,900 --> 01:12:05,900
curious about is,
um,

1400
01:12:05,900 --> 01:12:07,440
and I'd like to know what you think 
about this.

1401
01:12:07,860 --> 01:12:12,860
What do you think it is that's 
fundamentally driving the radical 

1402
01:12:12,860 --> 01:12:14,250
newness of the left?
Like why?

1403
01:12:14,490 --> 01:12:16,720
Because it,
it does seem so counterproductive.

1404
01:12:16,740 --> 01:12:19,920
Even two to the left,
so on stated positions,

1405
01:12:19,921 --> 01:12:22,530
you know,
because when I was an aspen for example,

1406
01:12:23,670 --> 01:12:28,670
I talked about the literature on 
biological differences between men and 

1407
01:12:28,670 --> 01:12:28,670
women in,
in psychology,

1408
01:12:28,670 --> 01:12:33,500
right?
It's like mostly men and the women are 

1409
01:12:33,500 --> 01:12:34,680
similar.
Even in the dimensions where they differ

1410
01:12:34,681 --> 01:12:39,681
most,
there's way more overlap than there is 

1411
01:12:39,681 --> 01:12:39,681
difference,
right?

1412
01:12:39,681 --> 01:12:43,041
So aggression is a good example of that.
So if you take a random man and a random

1413
01:12:43,891 --> 01:12:47,220
woman out of the population and you had 
to bet on who was the more aggressive,

1414
01:12:47,221 --> 01:12:50,040
if you bet on the man you'd be right 60 
percent of the time,

1415
01:12:50,190 --> 01:12:51,360
but that's not that much.

1416
01:12:51,600 --> 01:12:54,210
But then all the actions at the tails,
right?

1417
01:12:54,240 --> 01:12:58,200
So you don't care about how aggressive 
the average person is.

1418
01:12:58,201 --> 01:13:03,201
You care about how aggressive the really
aggressive people are and they're all 

1419
01:13:03,201 --> 01:13:07,461
male and so you end up putting them in 
prison which accounts for the massive 

1420
01:13:07,461 --> 01:13:10,971
differential between men and women in 
prison rates and so you can have small 

1421
01:13:10,971 --> 01:13:12,690
differences at the meeting and radical 
differences at the extremes.

1422
01:13:13,230 --> 01:13:18,230
So.
And that's the fact that people don't 

1423
01:13:18,230 --> 01:13:20,121
understand that is he is partly willful 
blindness on the part of the 

1424
01:13:20,121 --> 01:13:23,691
ideologically committed,
but also partly because it's somewhat 

1425
01:13:23,691 --> 01:13:26,600
complex statistically.
But then I think about the like the 

1426
01:13:26,600 --> 01:13:29,751
audience that I was addressing it aspen,
they weren't happy about me talking 

1427
01:13:29,751 --> 01:13:33,261
about biological differences in 
personality between men and women and I 

1428
01:13:33,261 --> 01:13:33,261
thought,
well,

1429
01:13:33,261 --> 01:13:36,840
what the hell do you want?
Exactly from your leftist perspective is

1430
01:13:36,841 --> 01:13:41,841
like,
why is it so necessary for you to make 

1431
01:13:41,841 --> 01:13:44,511
the presumption that there cannot be any
differences whatsoever between men and 

1432
01:13:44,511 --> 01:13:44,511
women?

1433
01:13:44,511 --> 01:13:49,130
It's like,
well first of all there are so that's a 

1434
01:13:49,130 --> 01:13:51,021
big problem for your theory,
but why all of a sudden has this become 

1435
01:13:51,021 --> 01:13:54,231
an axiomatic position of the left that 
these differences can exist when what 

1436
01:13:54,231 --> 01:13:56,580
you want to do in principle is free up 
people to make choices.

1437
01:13:56,790 --> 01:14:01,790
I think that or to make choices in a 
market that would allow for those 

1438
01:14:01,790 --> 01:14:03,480
choices in keeping with their intrinsic 
nature.

1439
01:14:03,510 --> 01:14:06,420
Like why did that?
I don't understand why that shifted.

1440
01:14:06,450 --> 01:14:09,570
And what's interesting is you're talking
about the intellectual liberal elite.

1441
01:14:09,600 --> 01:14:11,660
That's the type of people you were 
talking in front of,

1442
01:14:11,680 --> 01:14:11,960
right?
If

1443
01:14:12,550 --> 01:14:17,550
you were just talking in front of just a
group of lefties or a group of writers 

1444
01:14:17,550 --> 01:14:20,570
are saying about you,
about the commentariat yeah,

1445
01:14:20,620 --> 01:14:21,370
right.
Exactly.

1446
01:14:21,400 --> 01:14:22,050
Yeah.
Alright.

1447
01:14:22,870 --> 01:14:23,950
So what,
what do you do with that?

1448
01:14:24,010 --> 01:14:25,720
Well,
let me come straight at it.

1449
01:14:28,360 --> 01:14:33,360
We on the left had an idea that if we 
could get rid of cultural bias in iq 

1450
01:14:35,141 --> 01:14:39,460
testing,
if we could get rid of misogyny that was

1451
01:14:39,520 --> 01:14:44,520
structural in the workplace,
that we would get a particular kind of 

1452
01:14:44,520 --> 01:14:49,021
outcome.
And we did make things better in many 

1453
01:14:49,021 --> 01:14:52,261
ways,
but it didn't go as far as we were 

1454
01:14:52,261 --> 01:14:53,260
expecting.
And so this is what people are wrestling

1455
01:14:53,261 --> 01:14:55,450
with and you know,
I hesitate to call it this,

1456
01:14:55,451 --> 01:14:57,370
but I think it's the most powerful way 
of saying it.

1457
01:14:57,700 --> 01:15:00,070
It's the great depression shortage of 
2018.

1458
01:15:00,790 --> 01:15:05,790
And the problem is,
is that there still is structural 

1459
01:15:05,790 --> 01:15:05,790
oppression.

1460
01:15:05,790 --> 01:15:08,790
I mean,
look at Robert Moses is design a of New 

1461
01:15:08,790 --> 01:15:10,360
York city's a highways,
bridges and byways,

1462
01:15:10,680 --> 01:15:14,230
um,
famously trying to keep buses from going

1463
01:15:14,231 --> 01:15:17,560
to jones beach,
I guess as it jumped to jones beach.

1464
01:15:17,561 --> 01:15:19,150
He literally,
I mean I grew up on long island,

1465
01:15:19,151 --> 01:15:24,151
the bus,
the bridges going over the la at that 

1466
01:15:24,151 --> 01:15:27,060
area are lower because they didn't want 
us to bring the people from meals out 

1467
01:15:27,060 --> 01:15:29,410
into harlem so that it doesn't affect 
real estate prices somewhere else on the

1468
01:15:29,411 --> 01:15:31,430
east side.
So you know,

1469
01:15:31,690 --> 01:15:36,690
there really is structural oppression 
the way there was when there were 

1470
01:15:36,690 --> 01:15:40,770
literacy tests for voting which were 
constructed so that no black person 

1471
01:15:40,770 --> 01:15:42,520
could,
could pass because it was impossible.

1472
01:15:42,980 --> 01:15:47,980
Okay.
But there's less of it now and there's 

1473
01:15:47,980 --> 01:15:48,130
not enough of it to explain some of the 
differences.

1474
01:15:48,700 --> 01:15:53,700
And the great fear is,
is that the left program to try to 

1475
01:15:54,491 --> 01:15:58,750
produce better representation and better
opportunities for women,

1476
01:15:58,751 --> 01:16:03,751
for minorities,
whatever is going to stall out if we 

1477
01:16:03,751 --> 01:16:04,450
start to think of these things as 
differences.

1478
01:16:04,450 --> 01:16:06,150
So.
So why is it a problem that.

1479
01:16:06,340 --> 01:16:07,090
Okay,
fair enough.

1480
01:16:07,270 --> 01:16:09,190
Why is it a problem if it stalls out 
though?

1481
01:16:09,191 --> 01:16:14,191
Is it because there's all sorts of 
radical activists who then don't have 

1482
01:16:14,191 --> 01:16:14,600
anything to do or is there that's part 
of him that.

1483
01:16:14,610 --> 01:16:16,840
So what you've seen with the southern 
poverty law center,

1484
01:16:17,500 --> 01:16:22,500
which is that you have an institution 
that fundamentally a accomplished much 

1485
01:16:22,500 --> 01:16:26,311
of its mission,
but then it still had a large kitty and 

1486
01:16:26,311 --> 01:16:27,730
idle idle hands,
it sounds like humanities departments to

1487
01:16:27,731 --> 01:16:28,650
me.
Right.

1488
01:16:29,170 --> 01:16:30,340
Okay.
And then we can get to that.

1489
01:16:30,640 --> 01:16:35,640
But I also want to steal man,
the other position so that you have 

1490
01:16:35,640 --> 01:16:36,760
something to fight against or directed,
wrestle with.

1491
01:16:38,020 --> 01:16:43,020
If I think about I do something 
different with women in the workplace 

1492
01:16:43,020 --> 01:16:46,870
with respect to trying to figure out 
what is unfair to them because there are

1493
01:16:46,871 --> 01:16:49,990
things that are very unfair to them and 
one of the things I do is to say,

1494
01:16:49,991 --> 01:16:54,991
tell me about the great ideas of females
and the great contributions that are 

1495
01:16:54,991 --> 01:16:59,290
sitting there on the table in part 
because they had a female discover,

1496
01:16:59,980 --> 01:17:00,220
right?

1497
01:17:00,220 --> 01:17:01,170
So you could look at,
you know,

1498
01:17:01,171 --> 01:17:04,950
vira ruben's work in which never,
you know,

1499
01:17:04,990 --> 01:17:07,510
never got a nobel prize.
Everybody knows about it in,

1500
01:17:07,520 --> 01:17:12,520
in astrophysics.
But I went through one of these things 

1501
01:17:12,520 --> 01:17:15,461
with my wife where we did this thing 
with gauge theory in economics in the 

1502
01:17:15,461 --> 01:17:19,601
harvard economics department,
and I think it was one of the most 

1503
01:17:19,601 --> 01:17:23,741
sensational breakthroughs in a 
mathematical and bedrock economic theory

1504
01:17:25,170 --> 01:17:30,170
and the last 25 years,
and I'll just be very clear every time 

1505
01:17:30,170 --> 01:17:34,181
people want to figure out how to tax 
americans more and cut their benefits 

1506
01:17:34,940 --> 01:17:38,210
without paying the price of touching the
so called third rail of politics.

1507
01:17:38,211 --> 01:17:43,211
They realized that the cpi indexes both 
tax receipts and entitlements,

1508
01:17:43,430 --> 01:17:45,410
so payments like social security and 
medicare,

1509
01:17:46,280 --> 01:17:51,280
and if you can show that the cpi is 
overstated than the ideas that you get 

1510
01:17:51,280 --> 01:17:54,350
to take in more tax revenue and you get 
to pay old people and sick people less.

1511
01:17:54,680 --> 01:17:59,680
And so it's a very popular game in 
Washington to gerrymander the 

1512
01:17:59,680 --> 01:17:59,680
gerrymander,
the measurement.

1513
01:17:59,680 --> 01:18:00,980
Now,
the two ways that you do that.

1514
01:18:02,680 --> 01:18:05,540
One is,
is that you go from a fixed basket where

1515
01:18:05,541 --> 01:18:10,541
you have a,
let's say basketballs and glasses and 

1516
01:18:10,541 --> 01:18:13,631
you figure out what the price of that 
basket is over time to something which 

1517
01:18:13,631 --> 01:18:17,921
is what is the utility.
So the idea is maybe I want slightly 

1518
01:18:17,921 --> 01:18:18,740
more glasses or basketball,
you can do it with coffee and tea.

1519
01:18:18,741 --> 01:18:23,741
I'm willing to trade off some amount of 
coffee for some amount of tea to get my 

1520
01:18:23,741 --> 01:18:26,660
caffeine fix if there's a problem or a 
bumper crop in Brazil.

1521
01:18:26,920 --> 01:18:31,920
Okay.
The other thing you do is that you keep 

1522
01:18:31,920 --> 01:18:32,870
updating these baskets and that's called
chaining.

1523
01:18:33,470 --> 01:18:38,470
Well,
you can't do both of those things 

1524
01:18:38,470 --> 01:18:40,841
together because there's a,
a presumed impossibility results that 

1525
01:18:40,971 --> 01:18:45,380
you can't have a true cost of a chain 
cost of living index,

1526
01:18:45,381 --> 01:18:50,381
except that my wife and I solved that 
problem in the mid 19 nineties at the 

1527
01:18:50,381 --> 01:18:53,060
same time that the boskin commission was
trying to back out a,

1528
01:18:53,180 --> 01:18:58,180
an exact one point,
one percent overstatement because that 

1529
01:18:58,180 --> 01:18:58,180
would save a trillion dollar.

1530
01:18:58,180 --> 01:19:02,210
So in other words,
you have to understand they weren't 

1531
01:19:02,210 --> 01:19:02,210
given the task.
Go find a one point,

1532
01:19:02,210 --> 01:19:05,681
one percent overstatement and justify it
so that we can cut benefits and raise 

1533
01:19:05,681 --> 01:19:10,581
taxes.
And my wife got in the middle of that 

1534
01:19:10,581 --> 01:19:10,581
bank robbery,
uh,

1535
01:19:10,581 --> 01:19:12,320
as it was being attempted.
And so she got whacked.

1536
01:19:12,800 --> 01:19:15,440
Now I wanted to fight these sons of 
bitches,

1537
01:19:16,250 --> 01:19:21,250
absolutely.
In particular as a professor named dale 

1538
01:19:21,250 --> 01:19:21,950
jorgenson who spearheaded the attempt 
to,

1539
01:19:21,951 --> 01:19:24,320
uh,
really crushed her and when,

1540
01:19:24,330 --> 01:19:27,620
when she was on the,
she was getting her dissertation.

1541
01:19:28,340 --> 01:19:31,210
This is great work and the cost of it,
Jordan is,

1542
01:19:31,211 --> 01:19:36,211
is that there's great work done by women
that is sitting there because 

1543
01:19:36,211 --> 01:19:40,691
fundamentally the women don't want to 
fight the way you and I would fight for 

1544
01:19:40,691 --> 01:19:41,780
our work because it's not necessarily 
fun.

1545
01:19:42,380 --> 01:19:44,180
It's unpleasant.
And you know,

1546
01:19:44,181 --> 01:19:49,181
with me,
I have a very aggressive response to 

1547
01:19:49,181 --> 01:19:49,181
this.

1548
01:19:49,181 --> 01:19:49,430
It's like,
how dare you talk about my work,

1549
01:19:49,431 --> 01:19:50,960
do you know how much better my work is 
done,

1550
01:19:50,961 --> 01:19:55,290
your work and let's do this now.
I got that.

1551
01:19:55,660 --> 01:19:58,040
That's a complicated thing too because 
you know,

1552
01:19:58,041 --> 01:20:00,800
for,
for a piece of brilliant work to rise up

1553
01:20:00,801 --> 01:20:03,140
to the point where it's universally 
acclaimed,

1554
01:20:03,860 --> 01:20:07,150
it takes a lot more than merely the 
brilliant work that's like.

1555
01:20:07,210 --> 01:20:10,530
It's like,
it's like putting a product out into the

1556
01:20:10,531 --> 01:20:14,220
marketplace like a consumer product.
You might have a brilliant product,

1557
01:20:14,520 --> 01:20:19,520
but the fact that you have a brilliant 
product is about five percent of what 

1558
01:20:19,520 --> 01:20:23,091
you need to have a successful product 
because the rest of it is sales and 

1559
01:20:23,091 --> 01:20:26,391
marketing,
and then if so you might say there's 

1560
01:20:26,391 --> 01:20:29,250
many ideas that we have taken stock of 
that we should have taken stock of those

1561
01:20:29,251 --> 01:20:33,330
that we have taken stock of over this 
weird combination of brilliant idea plus

1562
01:20:33,360 --> 01:20:36,060
brilliant and forceful marketing plus 
luck.

1563
01:20:36,140 --> 01:20:36,930
Right,
and so,

1564
01:20:37,440 --> 01:20:38,970
so if,
if,

1565
01:20:39,120 --> 01:20:42,180
if it's the case for example,
that because women are less assertive,

1566
01:20:42,200 --> 01:20:45,210
they're less likely to fight those ideas
forward,

1567
01:20:45,270 --> 01:20:48,210
although equally likely to generate as 
many brilliant ideas,

1568
01:20:48,360 --> 01:20:50,730
then that's going to cause a detriment 
in their movement forward.

1569
01:20:50,750 --> 01:20:51,940
Well,
we need to contend with,

1570
01:20:51,960 --> 01:20:55,080
well that's what I'm trying to say,
which is that fundamentally the reason I

1571
01:20:55,081 --> 01:20:57,720
asked for don't tell me about the women 
being suppressed.

1572
01:20:57,750 --> 01:21:00,630
Tell me about the Ideas of women so I 
can.

1573
01:21:01,080 --> 01:21:04,110
I can use my aggressive as long as we 
have a male dominated system.

1574
01:21:04,620 --> 01:21:07,020
You have men who want to fight for great
ideas.

1575
01:21:07,390 --> 01:21:07,890
It's good.
Well,

1576
01:21:07,891 --> 01:21:12,891
but then the question is,
do we have a male dominant system or do 

1577
01:21:12,891 --> 01:21:14,280
we have a dominant dominated?
So this is,

1578
01:21:14,610 --> 01:21:15,210
let me,
let me,

1579
01:21:15,240 --> 01:21:18,300
let me tease this apart.
I have been in I think five,

1580
01:21:18,360 --> 01:21:19,740
almost all male field.

1581
01:21:20,070 --> 01:21:20,760
Um,
I've,

1582
01:21:20,790 --> 01:21:22,680
I've,
I've touched mathematics,

1583
01:21:22,681 --> 01:21:25,260
theoretical physics,
economics,

1584
01:21:25,290 --> 01:21:28,680
finance,
and a tech and they're not all male,

1585
01:21:28,681 --> 01:21:33,681
but the male dominated fields,
one of those fields I found had a 

1586
01:21:33,681 --> 01:21:36,690
cancerous attitude towards women that 
was just visible.

1587
01:21:36,691 --> 01:21:41,691
So I got a chance to see in finance all 
of the bad behavior that people talked 

1588
01:21:41,851 --> 01:21:43,380
about,
about the objectification,

1589
01:21:43,381 --> 01:21:44,640
about,
um,

1590
01:21:44,910 --> 01:21:46,320
you know,
locker room talk,

1591
01:21:46,321 --> 01:21:49,380
which was just absolutely natural.
Not in every context,

1592
01:21:49,381 --> 01:21:54,381
but it was often enough in the other 
fields in general.

1593
01:21:54,421 --> 01:21:59,190
Like in math,
I don't think I ever heard people making

1594
01:21:59,250 --> 01:22:03,810
nasty comments about women.
So in the same weird way,

1595
01:22:03,811 --> 01:22:05,910
it's not like I'm deaf to it because I 
can hear it.

1596
01:22:05,911 --> 01:22:09,720
In one case I didn't hear it very often 
and the other kids in physics,

1597
01:22:09,721 --> 01:22:11,700
I didn't hear many nasty comments about 
women,

1598
01:22:11,701 --> 01:22:15,630
but it was incredible.
Particle theory for a period of time was

1599
01:22:15,631 --> 01:22:20,631
incredibly aggressive,
like labor economics was super 

1600
01:22:20,631 --> 01:22:23,991
aggressive,
symplectic geometry inside of math was 

1601
01:22:23,991 --> 01:22:23,991
super female friendly.

1602
01:22:23,991 --> 01:22:27,690
So there is definitely this difference 
in texture between,

1603
01:22:27,940 --> 01:22:28,740
um,
the,

1604
01:22:29,000 --> 01:22:34,000
these different places in male dominated
fields and having seen relatively benign

1605
01:22:35,070 --> 01:22:38,130
male dominated fields at hyper toxic 
male dominated fields.

1606
01:22:38,160 --> 01:22:43,160
I can tell you that I don't love going 
into a particle theory seminar where 

1607
01:22:43,160 --> 01:22:47,190
everybody's peacocking because it's 
relatively uninteresting relative to the

1608
01:22:47,191 --> 01:22:50,610
work you would say to some degree that 
would indicate that the,

1609
01:22:50,670 --> 01:22:55,670
that the system has become somewhat 
corrupt in the ways that systems can be 

1610
01:22:55,670 --> 01:22:59,241
corrupt and that what's pushing you 
forward in those fields is less about 

1611
01:22:59,241 --> 01:23:02,040
competence and more about them.
And I don't know.

1612
01:23:02,220 --> 01:23:03,780
Well,
I don't know either,

1613
01:23:03,781 --> 01:23:04,800
but you could,
you could,

1614
01:23:04,890 --> 01:23:06,160
you could,
you could generate

1615
01:23:06,160 --> 01:23:11,160
that as a hypothesis,
but I'll tell you one of the things our 

1616
01:23:11,160 --> 01:23:13,531
psychometric work has revealed this is 
quite interesting is when we've looked 

1617
01:23:13,531 --> 01:23:17,371
at differences in men and women with 
regards to outcome and then controlled 

1618
01:23:17,371 --> 01:23:21,871
for personality.
The personality differences almost 

1619
01:23:21,871 --> 01:23:21,871
always obliterate the gender 
differences,

1620
01:23:21,871 --> 01:23:23,680
which means it's actually not a gender 
difference,

1621
01:23:23,681 --> 01:23:26,500
it's a personality difference,
but let's flip that because this is.

1622
01:23:26,640 --> 01:23:28,420
It isn't always the general.
I understand that,

1623
01:23:28,480 --> 01:23:30,910
so I think that that's very important,
but now you're going to get,

1624
01:23:30,911 --> 01:23:35,911
because I could say then for the the 
ideas of agreeable man in these fields 

1625
01:23:35,911 --> 01:23:38,890
might be as likely to be totally,
totally agree with you.

1626
01:23:38,920 --> 01:23:40,780
Now here's,
here's the next part of it.

1627
01:23:41,260 --> 01:23:44,200
Many let's say let's.
Let's not do it as male,

1628
01:23:44,201 --> 01:23:47,620
female,
many agreeable people have the idea that

1629
01:23:47,680 --> 01:23:51,900
the problem is is that the fields are so
tilted towards disagree ability.

1630
01:23:52,020 --> 01:23:53,290
No,
I don't happen to believe this,

1631
01:23:54,100 --> 01:23:59,100
that we're losing good ideas because 
agreeable people can't make progress and

1632
01:24:00,011 --> 01:24:05,011
in those circumstances the claim isn't.
Let's just have an open competition and 

1633
01:24:05,011 --> 01:24:09,391
see what rises to the top.
It's let's change the structure of 

1634
01:24:09,391 --> 01:24:10,450
things now this.
Okay,

1635
01:24:10,451 --> 01:24:12,150
so there's a problem wIth that.
So let let.

1636
01:24:12,180 --> 01:24:14,590
Let me find out what metric problem with
that.

1637
01:24:15,100 --> 01:24:20,100
Okay.
If you look at what predicts success in 

1638
01:24:20,100 --> 01:24:24,590
workplaces,
generally what predicts his iq and 

1639
01:24:24,590 --> 01:24:27,841
conscientiousness,
agreeableness is a very trivial 

1640
01:24:27,841 --> 01:24:27,841
predictor.
Now,

1641
01:24:27,841 --> 01:24:32,431
one of the things you do see is that 
agreeable people tend to get paid less 

1642
01:24:32,431 --> 01:24:34,210
for the same work,
but we don't know why that is exactly.

1643
01:24:34,211 --> 01:24:36,340
We don't know if they don't bargain as 
well.

1644
01:24:36,730 --> 01:24:39,850
I think that's the simplest explanation 
is that they're there.

1645
01:24:39,940 --> 01:24:42,340
It's easier to take advantage of 
agreeable people.

1646
01:24:42,430 --> 01:24:44,200
It's almost like the definition of 
agreeable.

1647
01:24:44,200 --> 01:24:49,200
It's the downside of being agreeable,
but agreeableness is not a very good 

1648
01:24:49,200 --> 01:24:52,951
predictor of workplace success.
There's actually a corrupt literature 

1649
01:24:52,951 --> 01:24:55,951
that's associated with this because 
there's a whole literature on emotional 

1650
01:24:55,951 --> 01:24:56,380
intelligence.
Emotional intelligence puts you ahead in

1651
01:24:56,381 --> 01:24:57,430
the workplace.
It's like,

1652
01:24:57,670 --> 01:24:59,260
no,
it doesn't.

1653
01:24:59,350 --> 01:25:04,350
Emotional intelligence is almost in 
indiscriminate from trait agreeableness 

1654
01:25:04,350 --> 01:25:08,670
and trait.
Agreeableness actually puts you behind 

1655
01:25:08,670 --> 01:25:08,670
in the,
especially in the managerial domain.

1656
01:25:08,670 --> 01:25:09,310
Now you might say,
well,

1657
01:25:09,311 --> 01:25:12,670
that means the managerial domain is 
prejudiced against agreeable people,

1658
01:25:12,910 --> 01:25:17,910
but then there's some evidence that 
disagreeable people make better 

1659
01:25:17,910 --> 01:25:20,401
managers,
and the reason for that is that they 

1660
01:25:20,401 --> 01:25:20,401
can't be pushed around because,
you know,

1661
01:25:20,401 --> 01:25:21,010
if you're a manager,
you might say,

1662
01:25:21,011 --> 01:25:26,011
well,
what you have to do is you have to deal 

1663
01:25:26,011 --> 01:25:27,421
with the concerns of your employees and 
that would be the agreeable 

1664
01:25:27,421 --> 01:25:30,121
interpretation,
but sometimes if you're a manager you 

1665
01:25:30,121 --> 01:25:31,090
have to take the slackers and give them 
hell.

1666
01:25:31,360 --> 01:25:31,960
And that's,
uh,

1667
01:25:32,080 --> 01:25:34,700
that's somethIng that only a 
disagreeable person can do this.

1668
01:25:35,770 --> 01:25:40,770
But there isn't much evidence on the 
psychometric front that agreeableness,

1669
01:25:41,860 --> 01:25:44,330
um,
that,

1670
01:25:44,620 --> 01:25:49,620
that agreeableness is a,
is a major contributor to workplace 

1671
01:25:49,620 --> 01:25:52,711
success in general.
So it isn't obvious to me from the 

1672
01:25:52,711 --> 01:25:55,771
psychometric work that the idea that 
hierarchies in general are contaminated 

1673
01:25:56,171 --> 01:25:59,350
by a preference for disagreeable people.
I don't see any evidence for that.

1674
01:25:59,351 --> 01:26:00,100
Well,
look,

1675
01:26:00,760 --> 01:26:04,160
part of the problem with this whole 
discussion is you have,

1676
01:26:05,030 --> 01:26:07,280
there are roles in which agreeability 
works.

1677
01:26:07,281 --> 01:26:08,930
There's,
you can have a team where there's,

1678
01:26:09,140 --> 01:26:11,360
you need a certain balance of these 
things.

1679
01:26:11,500 --> 01:26:13,220
It's probably works for customer 
service,

1680
01:26:13,221 --> 01:26:17,930
for example,
to be agreeable or right carrot people.

1681
01:26:17,960 --> 01:26:19,340
So all of these things.
I mean,

1682
01:26:19,400 --> 01:26:24,400
the world didn't come up with a big five
traits a and distribute us across them.

1683
01:26:28,300 --> 01:26:29,120
Uh,
if they,

1684
01:26:29,270 --> 01:26:32,540
if they don't have advantages,
like are you color blind?

1685
01:26:32,970 --> 01:26:34,610
No.
father is and he can,

1686
01:26:34,640 --> 01:26:39,640
he can,
he can see animals in the bush as I was 

1687
01:26:39,640 --> 01:26:39,640
going to make the point is that from my 
perspective,

1688
01:26:39,640 --> 01:26:40,820
your contrast blonde,
right?

1689
01:26:41,000 --> 01:26:46,000
Right.
And the idea is that when I'm talking 

1690
01:26:46,000 --> 01:26:47,690
about this,
that strikes color normal people as very

1691
01:26:47,691 --> 01:26:49,520
strange with,
well that's a strange way to look at the

1692
01:26:49,521 --> 01:26:51,650
world,
but the fact is is that these traits are

1693
01:26:51,651 --> 01:26:53,710
retained because they have different 
uses stats,

1694
01:26:53,780 --> 01:26:58,780
right?
That is the fact that if you focus on 

1695
01:26:58,780 --> 01:26:58,820
the right tail of the distribution of 
the extreme right tail,

1696
01:26:58,821 --> 01:27:03,821
if you hang out with billionaires,
very often in order to get to a 

1697
01:27:03,821 --> 01:27:07,061
billionaire status,
you have to be able to oppose large 

1698
01:27:07,061 --> 01:27:07,370
numbers of people and say they're all 
wrong and I'm right.

1699
01:27:08,180 --> 01:27:12,560
And then you also have to be right and 
you didn't even worse.

1700
01:27:13,950 --> 01:27:15,000
You have to be disagree.

1701
01:27:15,070 --> 01:27:16,250
Absolutely right,
but you know,

1702
01:27:16,610 --> 01:27:21,610
if I look at some of the things that,
that my friend peter teal can do that I 

1703
01:27:21,610 --> 01:27:22,610
find very few people can.
It's like,

1704
01:27:22,611 --> 01:27:27,611
can you hold a position?
Even if you know two years from now 

1705
01:27:27,611 --> 01:27:27,650
you're going to be proven right with two
years of scorn,

1706
01:27:28,070 --> 01:27:30,680
the average person is going to crumble.
Yeah.

1707
01:27:30,710 --> 01:27:35,710
Well that would also be partly trait 
neuroticism is that people have to be 

1708
01:27:35,710 --> 01:27:36,440
able to tolerate that level of stress 
and that's very,

1709
01:27:36,441 --> 01:27:38,090
very difficult.
This is what I'm trying to get at,

1710
01:27:38,091 --> 01:27:43,091
which is that people are looking at 
various reward structures and they're 

1711
01:27:43,091 --> 01:27:43,460
saying,
well,

1712
01:27:43,461 --> 01:27:48,461
that doesn't match my particular set of 
traits and I feel that my traits are 

1713
01:27:48,461 --> 01:27:48,461
valuable in those traits.
Probably are value,

1714
01:27:48,680 --> 01:27:53,680
but we're not all destined to become 
beyond say or peter teal,

1715
01:27:54,070 --> 01:27:56,720
but what seems to be happening that.

1716
01:27:56,720 --> 01:27:58,640
That's exactly right.
That's exactly right,

1717
01:27:58,641 --> 01:28:03,641
but what seems to be happening?
I think like if you look at the 

1718
01:28:03,641 --> 01:28:06,701
scandinavian countries,
the more egalitarian scandinavian 

1719
01:28:06,701 --> 01:28:10,631
countries,
that's where you're getting the most 

1720
01:28:10,631 --> 01:28:12,191
radical assortment of occupational 
status by gender and so I would say for 

1721
01:28:12,621 --> 01:28:14,630
example,
that if you tilt towards agreeableness,

1722
01:28:14,631 --> 01:28:19,631
which is actually a pretty good 
predictor of interest in people rather 

1723
01:28:19,631 --> 01:28:22,511
than interest in things,
the biggest difference between men and 

1724
01:28:22,511 --> 01:28:22,690
women seems to be an interest,
right manner,

1725
01:28:22,700 --> 01:28:26,390
reliably more interested in things and 
women more reliably interesting people.

1726
01:28:26,420 --> 01:28:28,220
The difference is one standard 
deviation,

1727
01:28:28,400 --> 01:28:33,400
so it's a big difference and what seems 
to be happening in the scandinavian 

1728
01:28:33,400 --> 01:28:35,750
countries is people are sorting 
themselves by their temperament,

1729
01:28:36,110 --> 01:28:38,630
which is what they should do because 
your temperament,

1730
01:28:38,631 --> 01:28:42,320
as you just pointed out,
predisposes you to success in some realm

1731
01:28:42,350 --> 01:28:43,580
and not in others,
right?

1732
01:28:43,640 --> 01:28:46,430
You don't get both failure and success 
and failure,

1733
01:28:46,670 --> 01:28:51,670
so because women are on average,
more agreeable and perhaps higher in 

1734
01:28:51,670 --> 01:28:56,021
negative emotion,
it isn't obvious how that fits into the 

1735
01:28:56,021 --> 01:28:56,021
equation.
there are more sensitive to the distress

1736
01:28:56,021 --> 01:28:59,000
of others and more likely to be 
compassionate in their care.

1737
01:28:59,060 --> 01:29:02,010
So what happens?
You open the landscape of

1738
01:29:02,010 --> 01:29:07,010
competitiveness to women.
They immediately dominate the health 

1739
01:29:07,010 --> 01:29:09,631
care field and that's exactly what's 
happened now and part of the problem 

1740
01:29:09,631 --> 01:29:13,191
with that is that healthcare as an 
occupation doesn't scale well like 

1741
01:29:13,191 --> 01:29:17,961
engineering does for example,
and so it's very difficult to generate 

1742
01:29:17,961 --> 01:29:21,381
large fortunes in healthcare and that's 
one of the things that skews the gender 

1743
01:29:21,381 --> 01:29:25,221
distribution of wealth,
but it looks like if we left people be 

1744
01:29:25,221 --> 01:29:28,591
to the degree that we can,
they would sort themselves into 

1745
01:29:28,591 --> 01:29:31,341
occupations by temperament and that 
might be the question of like when when 

1746
01:29:31,801 --> 01:29:34,490
we had our first child,
we had a wrote a,

1747
01:29:34,640 --> 01:29:38,160
a practice where there was a rotation of
the ob gyn who deliver.

1748
01:29:38,370 --> 01:29:40,740
We had this one woman we were totally on
the same page with.

1749
01:29:40,741 --> 01:29:43,050
We loved her.
Everything about her was fantastic.

1750
01:29:43,051 --> 01:29:48,051
We were,
we were simpatico and my wife's labor 

1751
01:29:48,051 --> 01:29:48,480
went on and on and on and on.

1752
01:29:48,560 --> 01:29:51,150
We've supposedly,
we were getting closer and closer.

1753
01:29:51,300 --> 01:29:56,300
Finally sheet.
This woman couldn't take it anymore and 

1754
01:29:56,300 --> 01:29:56,300
she said,
I got to go to sleep,

1755
01:29:56,300 --> 01:29:59,720
and the guy that we dreaded the six foot
four guy with the bow tie who came from 

1756
01:29:59,720 --> 01:30:00,990
a totally different era.
We called them,

1757
01:30:00,991 --> 01:30:05,991
the undertaker,
comes in and he says she's completely 

1758
01:30:05,991 --> 01:30:05,991
blown,
uh,

1759
01:30:05,991 --> 01:30:07,950
where we are in the process.
You're barely dilated at all.

1760
01:30:07,951 --> 01:30:10,550
We need to deliver this child 
immediately via says area.

1761
01:30:11,010 --> 01:30:11,660
It's like,
huh,

1762
01:30:11,820 --> 01:30:12,780
right.
Well,

1763
01:30:12,870 --> 01:30:17,070
the son of a bitch saved the situation 
for my,

1764
01:30:17,190 --> 01:30:19,140
for my,
my wife and my daughter.

1765
01:30:19,170 --> 01:30:21,450
Yep.
And the idea is I didn't like them.

1766
01:30:21,451 --> 01:30:26,451
One absolutely mad that happens.
And that guy was a woman who diagnosed 

1767
01:30:26,451 --> 01:30:27,270
our daughter with,
with arthritis.

1768
01:30:27,271 --> 01:30:29,250
Same thing.
I was really mad at her,

1769
01:30:29,460 --> 01:30:34,460
really mad at her.
She was very disagreeable and she was 

1770
01:30:34,460 --> 01:30:34,680
right and let's be very clear.

1771
01:30:34,710 --> 01:30:37,230
PaSsion and right are not the same as 
same thing.

1772
01:30:37,320 --> 01:30:42,320
The woman who,
the reason that we didn't have big 

1773
01:30:42,320 --> 01:30:44,970
flipper babies for thalidomide commonly 
in the United States was one woman who I

1774
01:30:44,971 --> 01:30:49,950
think went to university of chicago at 
like 16 and she stood up and said,

1775
01:30:49,951 --> 01:30:52,870
I don't like the data on this drug and I
don't know,

1776
01:30:52,940 --> 01:30:57,940
I don't think you drug companies have 
done enough to prove to me that this is 

1777
01:30:57,940 --> 01:31:00,300
safe to prescribing to pregnant woman.
And she just put up her hand and stopped

1778
01:31:00,301 --> 01:31:04,350
it.
Now I don't know what I'm going to use,

1779
01:31:04,351 --> 01:31:07,920
son of a bitch,
son of a bitch saved how many.

1780
01:31:08,260 --> 01:31:11,130
And then she's a national hero and we 
shouldn't be celebrating.

1781
01:31:11,210 --> 01:31:15,750
The issue is is that it's not down to 
healthcare,

1782
01:31:15,950 --> 01:31:18,520
agreeable or disagreeable.
The problem is,

1783
01:31:18,521 --> 01:31:23,521
is that we now have so much information 
about ourselves and about the 

1784
01:31:23,521 --> 01:31:27,351
occupations and the reward structures 
and there is a lot of structural 

1785
01:31:27,351 --> 01:31:30,951
unfairness and there is a lot of 
unfairness about here's your endowment 

1786
01:31:30,951 --> 01:31:35,271
and you were given different gifts and 
then there's a certain amount of luck 

1787
01:31:35,271 --> 01:31:38,250
that we are all struggling with the idea
that we have so much information and not

1788
01:31:38,251 --> 01:31:43,251
enough oppression to explain this and 
we're not necessarily happy with the 

1789
01:31:43,251 --> 01:31:43,251
outcome.

1790
01:31:43,251 --> 01:31:45,920
We don't necessarily want to have an 
honest conversation about,

1791
01:31:45,950 --> 01:31:46,460
well,
so then,

1792
01:31:46,500 --> 01:31:48,390
okay,
so there's another element to that too,

1793
01:31:48,391 --> 01:31:53,391
which is okay.
The question might be to what degree are

1794
01:31:54,991 --> 01:31:58,650
we required to tolerate a certain amount
of ineradicable suffering?

1795
01:31:58,830 --> 01:32:00,370
Because that's the argument you're 
basically

1796
01:32:00,370 --> 01:32:01,510
making.
You're saying,

1797
01:32:01,511 --> 01:32:02,770
look,
we can,

1798
01:32:02,890 --> 01:32:05,230
we can equalize and we can provide 
opportunity.

1799
01:32:05,380 --> 01:32:10,380
And we've done,
we've hit the point of diminishing 

1800
01:32:10,380 --> 01:32:10,380
returns now,
not everywhere obviously,

1801
01:32:10,380 --> 01:32:14,870
and and not in every sector,
but you could make the case that we've 

1802
01:32:14,870 --> 01:32:17,611
hit the point of diminishing returns and
stIll there is a tremenDous amount of 

1803
01:32:17,611 --> 01:32:20,460
inequality and suffering so I can,
We don't find that acceptable at csu,

1804
01:32:20,520 --> 01:32:25,520
but the problem is the more you push to 
remove that last bit of eradicable 

1805
01:32:25,520 --> 01:32:29,491
suffering,
the more likely you are to produce a 

1806
01:32:29,491 --> 01:32:31,360
worst kickback in another place.
And it's not an easy thing to contain in

1807
01:32:31,430 --> 01:32:33,250
the fact is that we're going to be 
discussing this,

1808
01:32:33,251 --> 01:32:38,251
whether an nbc,
cbs or abc lIkes it and they can't do 

1809
01:32:38,251 --> 01:32:42,451
anything about shutting this 
conversation down until youtube or 

1810
01:32:42,451 --> 01:32:43,510
twitter in a really decides to get heavy
handed and give us the boot.

1811
01:32:43,720 --> 01:32:47,050
And so fundamentally we don't sound like
what we're supposed to send.

1812
01:32:47,051 --> 01:32:48,940
Is the sound like an outright 
conversation?

1813
01:32:48,941 --> 01:32:50,560
Does it sound hyper conservative?
No.

1814
01:32:50,740 --> 01:32:53,620
It's a very difficult picture.
And the key problem is,

1815
01:32:53,621 --> 01:32:58,621
is that the only place that's being 
explored is in these super luxurious 

1816
01:32:58,621 --> 01:33:01,120
long form interview.
I have no idea how people tune in.

1817
01:33:01,500 --> 01:33:04,570
Like when we went to tempe,
people were tracking these conversations

1818
01:33:04,571 --> 01:33:06,960
at a level that we're not tracking 
conversational.

1819
01:33:07,180 --> 01:33:09,740
It's incredible care.
They actually care.

1820
01:33:10,940 --> 01:33:15,940
They know that the cognitive lego they 
been handed is not capable of getting a 

1821
01:33:15,940 --> 01:33:17,410
look surgically.
Look what's happening at harvard.

1822
01:33:17,590 --> 01:33:19,810
This is such an interesting example 
about,

1823
01:33:19,870 --> 01:33:21,550
about,
about the entire landscape.

1824
01:33:21,551 --> 01:33:25,900
It's like the upshot.
It looks like the upshot of the,

1825
01:33:26,060 --> 01:33:31,060
um,
of the policies designed to produce 

1826
01:33:31,060 --> 01:33:34,300
something approximating equity or at 
least equality of opportunity.

1827
01:33:34,450 --> 01:33:39,450
The gerrymandering of the admissions 
process has have the number of asians at

1828
01:33:40,240 --> 01:33:43,360
harvard and then harvard is of course 
denying that strenuously.

1829
01:33:43,570 --> 01:33:44,110
And they say,
well,

1830
01:33:44,111 --> 01:33:49,111
our selection method is too esoteric to 
be captured properly by the statistics.

1831
01:33:49,391 --> 01:33:50,380
It's like,
oh,

1832
01:33:50,500 --> 01:33:52,300
that's really how you're going to do.
Right?

1833
01:33:53,240 --> 01:33:54,530
There's nowhere,
there's no.

1834
01:33:55,240 --> 01:33:58,840
The harvard math department I think had 
one female mathematician,

1835
01:33:58,841 --> 01:34:02,410
I think it doesn't have a senior female 
mathematician and I can be wrong and I'm

1836
01:34:02,411 --> 01:34:05,290
sure that the university is trying to 
put pressure.

1837
01:34:05,291 --> 01:34:06,550
Hey,
what's wrong with you guys?

1838
01:34:06,551 --> 01:34:11,551
Get with the program.
The national science foundation is 

1839
01:34:11,551 --> 01:34:11,870
trying to do that across the entire stem
disciplines now and they're really gonna

1840
01:34:11,890 --> 01:34:16,890
muck up math by,
by playIng around with this because the 

1841
01:34:16,890 --> 01:34:16,890
data show,
it's quite interesting.

1842
01:34:16,890 --> 01:34:19,450
The data showed that if you look at 
junior high,

1843
01:34:19,930 --> 01:34:22,480
there's approximately.
There's some dispute about this.

1844
01:34:22,520 --> 01:34:27,520
There still might be evidence that 
there's a small percentage of a small 

1845
01:34:28,870 --> 01:34:31,900
advantage demand at the highest levels 
of mathematical ability,

1846
01:34:31,901 --> 01:34:36,901
but I'll leave that aside for now.
The more general data show that there's 

1847
01:34:36,901 --> 01:34:39,040
plenty of gifted women and there's 
plenty of gifted girls.

1848
01:34:39,041 --> 01:34:44,041
There's plenty of gifted boys,
but the gifted boys are gifted in math 

1849
01:34:44,041 --> 01:34:47,581
and not verbally.
Whereas the gifted girls in math or 

1850
01:34:47,581 --> 01:34:50,131
gifted verbally too.
And so one of the consequences is that 

1851
01:34:50,131 --> 01:34:51,090
because math is a very specialized 
opportunity,

1852
01:34:51,100 --> 01:34:52,510
costs are higher.
Yeah,

1853
01:34:52,630 --> 01:34:53,140
exactly.
Yeah.

1854
01:34:53,260 --> 01:34:56,080
The girls decide not to pursue.
The thing is,

1855
01:34:56,081 --> 01:34:58,280
is that math perfectly well tolerates

1856
01:34:58,640 --> 01:35:02,390
the females that it understands their 
work and can't live without.

1857
01:35:02,391 --> 01:35:03,630
I mean,
if I think about emi,

1858
01:35:03,640 --> 01:35:06,260
nurturer or karen [inaudible] bag,
or do some mcdevitt,

1859
01:35:06,270 --> 01:35:09,860
there's a huge number of women who are 
very well integrated,

1860
01:35:10,360 --> 01:35:10,770
uh,
you know,

1861
01:35:10,780 --> 01:35:12,380
in physics,
people like Lisa Randall,

1862
01:35:12,920 --> 01:35:17,920
I,
I don't even think about there being 

1863
01:35:17,920 --> 01:35:17,920
women.
Mathematicians are women.

1864
01:35:17,920 --> 01:35:19,250
Physicists like that result,
this paper.

1865
01:35:19,580 --> 01:35:20,490
Right?
And the idea,

1866
01:35:20,500 --> 01:35:21,820
thank god for that.
Right?

1867
01:35:21,920 --> 01:35:24,400
But the point that I'm trying to get at 
here is,

1868
01:35:24,401 --> 01:35:29,401
is that there are still structural 
barriers and there's probably something 

1869
01:35:29,401 --> 01:35:30,770
that isn't a structural barrier,
like for example,

1870
01:35:31,200 --> 01:35:34,250
the incentive structures and pay keeps 
going down.

1871
01:35:34,400 --> 01:35:37,250
My guess is that you'll get more females
in,

1872
01:35:37,430 --> 01:35:41,840
which is a totally perverse effect 
that's been studied that you start going

1873
01:35:41,841 --> 01:35:44,100
into the female and minority,
uh,

1874
01:35:44,270 --> 01:35:47,660
sectors when men feel that they have 
higher,

1875
01:35:47,720 --> 01:35:49,880
uh,
opportunity cost based on their level of

1876
01:35:49,881 --> 01:35:54,881
aggression that they can go into 
management consulting or wall street or 

1877
01:35:54,881 --> 01:35:59,610
a sheet question is we didn't need to be
able to have the real conversation 

1878
01:35:59,610 --> 01:36:00,290
somewhere and it needs

1879
01:36:00,340 --> 01:36:05,340
tonight.
We also need to have a conversation 

1880
01:36:05,340 --> 01:36:07,381
about white.
It might be advantageous to be paid 

1881
01:36:07,381 --> 01:36:10,141
less.
One of the reasons it's it's 

1882
01:36:10,141 --> 01:36:10,141
advantageous to be paid less is the 
demands are less on you,

1883
01:36:10,141 --> 01:36:15,000
so if you have other things that you 
want to do with your life than taking a 

1884
01:36:15,000 --> 01:36:15,370
job that pays less.
This happens in law all the time.

1885
01:36:15,490 --> 01:36:20,490
All the time.
I worked as a consultant for legal 

1886
01:36:20,490 --> 01:36:23,191
companies for,
for law firms for 10 years with lots of 

1887
01:36:23,191 --> 01:36:24,010
high end women and I saw the same thing 
happened all the time.

1888
01:36:24,100 --> 01:36:26,770
It end the law.
The law firms know this right?

1889
01:36:26,771 --> 01:36:31,771
To the core and all the women in the law
firms know what to almost all the women 

1890
01:36:31,771 --> 01:36:34,030
bail out of the high end positions in 
law in their early thirties.

1891
01:36:34,510 --> 01:36:35,170
Well,
why?

1892
01:36:35,470 --> 01:36:38,290
Well,
it's partly because if they're making,

1893
01:36:38,291 --> 01:36:41,080
say they're making 350 to $500,000
a year,

1894
01:36:41,081 --> 01:36:46,081
they're charging a thousand dollars an 
hour while the workload is absolutely 

1895
01:36:46,081 --> 01:36:49,141
insane.
You better be buIlding 2100 hours a 

1896
01:36:49,141 --> 01:36:49,141
year,
right?

1897
01:36:49,141 --> 01:36:53,761
If you're going to stay in that position
and you're on call all the time and 

1898
01:36:53,761 --> 01:36:57,691
you're basically working 16 hour days,
but so maybe maybe what you want to do 

1899
01:36:57,821 --> 01:37:01,690
instead is find a nine to five job that 
pays half as much,

1900
01:37:01,810 --> 01:37:05,070
but you get to have a light more 
psychotic inside of the universities.

1901
01:37:05,071 --> 01:37:10,071
And here's what.
Here's what nobody really wants to 

1902
01:37:10,071 --> 01:37:11,860
discuss.
The great danger according to many of my

1903
01:37:11,861 --> 01:37:13,000
colleagues in

1904
01:37:14,220 --> 01:37:18,260
placed well placed in in high level a 
science departments,

1905
01:37:18,530 --> 01:37:23,210
is they say the followup.
We don't know which females are going to

1906
01:37:23,211 --> 01:37:28,211
discover the pleasures of family after 
we've invested in.

1907
01:37:28,750 --> 01:37:31,460
And so the idea is is that sometime in 
their mid thirties,

1908
01:37:31,550 --> 01:37:34,940
some number of of women,
they think discover,

1909
01:37:34,941 --> 01:37:39,941
oh my god,
I've never been so fulfilled is when 

1910
01:37:39,941 --> 01:37:39,941
I've had my child.
And some women say,

1911
01:37:39,941 --> 01:37:40,730
I can't wait to get back to the lab.
Right?

1912
01:37:41,030 --> 01:37:46,030
And these are two different reactions.
So by pushing the point of commitment 

1913
01:37:46,030 --> 01:37:50,440
farther and farther towards middle age,
what you're doing is you're actually 

1914
01:37:50,440 --> 01:37:55,181
screening out the fact that you don't 
know which people you're going to invest

1915
01:37:55,231 --> 01:37:58,470
in and they're going to decide that they
have something more interesting to do in

1916
01:37:58,471 --> 01:38:03,471
their life in terms of work or that 
Compelled because also has to do with 

1917
01:38:03,471 --> 01:38:04,920
aging parents right now.

1918
01:38:04,970 --> 01:38:09,970
Right?
The fact is that women are more 

1919
01:38:09,970 --> 01:38:12,051
conscientious with respect to child 
rearing and with aging parents 

1920
01:38:12,051 --> 01:38:15,351
generically than men.
And so part of the game and a function 

1921
01:38:15,351 --> 01:38:18,801
of being agreeable,
probably a function of fitness where 

1922
01:38:18,801 --> 01:38:20,340
yes,
the idea is that uncertain,

1923
01:38:20,740 --> 01:38:25,050
uncertain paternity and maternity means 
that in a highly k selected species,

1924
01:38:25,380 --> 01:38:27,750
females are going to be ever more 
focused on,

1925
01:38:27,780 --> 01:38:29,610
on,
on,

1926
01:38:29,640 --> 01:38:34,640
on kin in this way.
Maybe that's the reason that the 

1927
01:38:34,640 --> 01:38:36,951
differences in agreeableness evolved.
I'm not even thought about that because 

1928
01:38:36,951 --> 01:38:37,970
while that could be,
I never thought about that,

1929
01:38:37,980 --> 01:38:42,980
that's likely explanation,
but the issue that fundamentally we 

1930
01:38:42,980 --> 01:38:45,690
would defer tenure as a means of 
screening out,

1931
01:38:46,020 --> 01:38:51,020
um,
females who are going to invest in 

1932
01:38:51,020 --> 01:38:51,020
fertility.
That is very interesting.

1933
01:38:51,020 --> 01:38:51,250
If you look at feminist,
uh,

1934
01:38:51,480 --> 01:38:56,480
scientists in the fifties,
you have women who had four kids and 

1935
01:38:56,480 --> 01:38:59,300
they spent a life in science and very 
often you look,

1936
01:38:59,340 --> 01:39:00,780
you poke and prod at these things.

1937
01:39:01,050 --> 01:39:06,050
Well,
there was an army of servants because 

1938
01:39:06,050 --> 01:39:06,330
there was wealth in the family in a very
often.

1939
01:39:06,870 --> 01:39:08,160
Right?
And so what,

1940
01:39:08,250 --> 01:39:13,250
what are my claim is if you really want 
to do something profound for women in 

1941
01:39:13,250 --> 01:39:17,421
technical subjects,
you should pay them more and you should 

1942
01:39:17,421 --> 01:39:19,020
get them help in the house.
Didn't work in law.

1943
01:39:19,080 --> 01:39:21,420
Well,
this is the issue because to some extent

1944
01:39:21,421 --> 01:39:23,220
it's a question of fulfillment.
Most of them,

1945
01:39:23,221 --> 01:39:25,380
most of the women that I work with,
they all have nannies.

1946
01:39:25,381 --> 01:39:27,480
They outsourced all their domestic 
duties.

1947
01:39:27,481 --> 01:39:32,481
Like that was covered man.
And that was part of all lemme tell you 

1948
01:39:32,481 --> 01:39:35,840
more successful group of people than I 
do because very often had the money for 

1949
01:39:35,840 --> 01:39:38,970
if when two people can't get jobs 
together and contiguous states,

1950
01:39:39,450 --> 01:39:39,990
you know,
it's like,

1951
01:39:40,160 --> 01:39:45,160
oh,
I've got a job in Oklahoma and he's got 

1952
01:39:45,160 --> 01:39:45,810
a job in Alabama and we try to see each 
other two weekends a month.

1953
01:39:46,160 --> 01:39:49,410
You know,
things have gone wildly off the rails,

1954
01:39:49,411 --> 01:39:54,411
but the key point is that employers are 
playing games,

1955
01:39:55,230 --> 01:39:59,910
trying to figure out this change in the 
Life cycle where some women are very,

1956
01:39:59,911 --> 01:40:04,110
very happy doing kickass work throughout
their life.

1957
01:40:04,200 --> 01:40:06,210
maybe they can figure out how to do it 
all.

1958
01:40:06,270 --> 01:40:07,740
Some of them can.
Some of them can.

1959
01:40:07,741 --> 01:40:08,700
Yeah.
It's pretty hard to do.

1960
01:40:08,701 --> 01:40:10,950
It's pretty hard to do at all.
It helps if you have money.

1961
01:40:11,010 --> 01:40:12,150
It does.
It does help,

1962
01:40:13,470 --> 01:40:18,470
but we are not owning up to what,
what are these games and what are these 

1963
01:40:18,470 --> 01:40:21,280
differences and where should we be,
where should we be subsidized?

1964
01:40:21,281 --> 01:40:24,920
We're also not owning up to the fact 
that that gender difference in pay isn't

1965
01:40:24,930 --> 01:40:29,930
a gender difference.
It's a mother difference because women 

1966
01:40:29,930 --> 01:40:32,090
take the big hit and their salaries when
they decide to have kids that no,

1967
01:40:32,130 --> 01:40:36,090
it's not just that,
but that no one and nothing is ever just

1968
01:40:36,091 --> 01:40:36,570
one thing.

1969
01:40:36,660 --> 01:40:41,660
Right.
But the whole thing about equal pay for 

1970
01:40:41,660 --> 01:40:41,660
equal work and seventy five cents on the
dollar,

1971
01:40:41,660 --> 01:40:45,860
right,
is that when you poke and prod at that 

1972
01:40:45,860 --> 01:40:48,870
there is an unfairness and there is a 
misrepresentation.

1973
01:40:48,930 --> 01:40:53,930
And the point is we're not comfortable 
having open conversation about do we 

1974
01:40:55,601 --> 01:41:00,601
want to subsidize people based on this 
different than my wife has a really 

1975
01:41:00,601 --> 01:41:00,601
interesting point.
And she said,

1976
01:41:00,790 --> 01:41:05,790
look,
I believe in the fish area in 

1977
01:41:05,790 --> 01:41:07,920
equivalence between male and female is 
strategies were males tend to be the 

1978
01:41:07,920 --> 01:41:07,920
high risk,
high return,

1979
01:41:07,920 --> 01:41:09,720
moderate risk,
moderate return.

1980
01:41:10,030 --> 01:41:15,030
There was a time when wars were common 
in men got called up and women didn't 

1981
01:41:15,030 --> 01:41:17,280
have as high end prospects and 
everybody's working in the fields or you

1982
01:41:17,281 --> 01:41:18,880
know,
washing clothes at home.

1983
01:41:19,240 --> 01:41:24,240
And then her point it's really 
interesting is knowledge work became 

1984
01:41:24,240 --> 01:41:27,280
wildly more fulfillinG very quickly and 
the number of wars,

1985
01:41:27,370 --> 01:41:29,530
and this is my identity to it has gone 
down.

1986
01:41:30,120 --> 01:41:35,120
And so suddenly it's much better to be 
male in her way of thinking than it is 

1987
01:41:35,120 --> 01:41:36,550
female in a way that was never true 
before.

1988
01:41:37,270 --> 01:41:40,750
And so there is a novelty effect,
which is that,

1989
01:41:41,090 --> 01:41:46,090
um,
knowledge work is outpacing the 

1990
01:41:46,090 --> 01:41:47,820
fulfillment of child rearing at some 
level because the,

1991
01:41:47,821 --> 01:41:52,480
the problems that you can solve if 
you're well placed to do so,

1992
01:41:52,930 --> 01:41:57,930
uh,
have increased in number and they're 

1993
01:41:57,930 --> 01:42:00,301
very,
very fulfilling and there are also 

1994
01:42:00,301 --> 01:42:02,851
disproportionately lucrative at least in
some situations and disproportionately 

1995
01:42:02,851 --> 01:42:02,851
lucrative.
And so I,

1996
01:42:02,851 --> 01:42:04,690
I do think that one of the things We 
have to do,

1997
01:42:05,180 --> 01:42:05,770
um,
you know,

1998
01:42:05,850 --> 01:42:10,850
look at the Vietnam war memorial and I 
got like eight female names on it and 

1999
01:42:12,461 --> 01:42:13,180
it's just,
you know,

2000
01:42:13,210 --> 01:42:14,680
george,
tom,

2001
01:42:14,920 --> 01:42:15,970
Chad,
you know,

2002
01:42:16,470 --> 01:42:21,470
right.
So there is this forgetting of the fact 

2003
01:42:21,470 --> 01:42:25,200
that maleness has this huge downside,
which is the high risk part of the high 

2004
01:42:25,200 --> 01:42:25,720
risk,
high return strategy.

2005
01:42:25,920 --> 01:42:30,920
Know you're point about interest in 
things over people at my local pinball.

2006
01:42:31,390 --> 01:42:33,520
Well,
san francisco would,

2007
01:42:33,580 --> 01:42:35,770
you know,
I take my son there,

2008
01:42:35,771 --> 01:42:40,771
there's a,
there's a woman's room and they're 

2009
01:42:40,771 --> 01:42:41,200
clearly pinball machines that are 
intended to get a female audience,

2010
01:42:41,201 --> 01:42:44,840
but it's like 20 to one males too few 
meals because it's,

2011
01:42:44,890 --> 01:42:48,640
it's this kind of robotic activity where
you're just putting money into a machine

2012
01:42:48,641 --> 01:42:50,740
and you're watching a ball and some 
flashing lights.

2013
01:42:50,980 --> 01:42:55,980
I find it quite entertaining,
but I look at myself and I think you're 

2014
01:42:55,980 --> 01:42:55,980
saying cigs,
man,

2015
01:42:55,980 --> 01:42:57,730
I'm out of my mind.
Well,

2016
01:42:57,731 --> 01:42:58,900
you know,
it's interesting too,

2017
01:42:58,901 --> 01:43:03,901
is that that high risk,
high return strategy is also not that 

2018
01:43:03,901 --> 01:43:08,431
common among men.
It's just that the people who do the 

2019
01:43:08,431 --> 01:43:09,400
high risk high return strategy are 
disproportionately men.

2020
01:43:09,700 --> 01:43:14,700
And so one of the things that I've been 
trying to struggle with is that like 

2021
01:43:14,700 --> 01:43:16,210
there's a small number of people who are
hyper productive in any discipline.

2022
01:43:16,210 --> 01:43:18,400
That's the price's law phenomenon.
So you see,

2023
01:43:18,401 --> 01:43:20,080
for example,
in scientific publishing,

2024
01:43:20,350 --> 01:43:23,680
the median number of publications for 
men and women is very similar,

2025
01:43:24,430 --> 01:43:27,240
immediate number,
but the people who poe,

2026
01:43:27,370 --> 01:43:32,180
who hyper publish are almost all made 
that telimans of zach's.

2027
01:43:32,460 --> 01:43:37,460
That's right.
The gas box of science and then the 

2028
01:43:37,460 --> 01:43:40,540
painful part of that is is that it's the
people it looks like it's the people who

2029
01:43:40,541 --> 01:43:42,610
are hyper productive that drive the 
science forward,

2030
01:43:42,910 --> 01:43:45,460
so the median types are actually 
somewhat irrelevant.

2031
01:43:45,490 --> 01:43:49,240
It's only the hyper productive people 
that count and their disproportionate.

2032
01:43:49,241 --> 01:43:52,070
But even then I've heard you on this 
point,

2033
01:43:52,071 --> 01:43:57,071
I want to take issue.
Is kurt girdle hyper productive or was 

2034
01:43:57,071 --> 01:43:58,880
he and I would say yes he was.
Did he publish very much?

2035
01:43:58,881 --> 01:44:00,470
Almost nothing.
Well,

2036
01:44:00,530 --> 01:44:05,530
quantity isn't the one good one.
I don't think so correlated at point 

2037
01:44:06,891 --> 01:44:10,220
three with citation count independent of
numBer of publication count is.

2038
01:44:10,220 --> 01:44:11,240
I know,
I know we've got.

2039
01:44:11,480 --> 01:44:14,450
We've got a really dangerous problem in 
that.

2040
01:44:14,451 --> 01:44:19,451
The metrics that we've developed,
we've put way too much on and you know 

2041
01:44:19,451 --> 01:44:19,451
that's,
that's the.

2042
01:44:19,451 --> 01:44:21,020
You could say that that's a universal 
problem.

2043
01:44:21,050 --> 01:44:22,700
Be careful what you measure.
Right?

2044
01:44:22,880 --> 01:44:25,630
And I mean it's hard to measure 
scientific impact with any degree.

2045
01:44:25,660 --> 01:44:28,700
This is why I'm so an unpopular in this 
area,

2046
01:44:28,701 --> 01:44:33,701
which is I just believe in giving slush 
funds to highly disagreeable people of 

2047
01:44:33,701 --> 01:44:38,111
high achievement and say,
go figure out who you want to fund 

2048
01:44:38,111 --> 01:44:40,520
because a lot of this stuff can't be 
justified by any metric,

2049
01:44:40,521 --> 01:44:45,521
and by the way,
that's why I'm big on the selection end 

2050
01:44:45,521 --> 01:44:47,940
of things.
Should you select qualified people and 

2051
01:44:47,940 --> 01:44:47,940
leave them the hell alone?
Well,

2052
01:44:47,940 --> 01:44:49,520
I mean I actually working together on 
this.

2053
01:44:49,640 --> 01:44:54,640
I mean my.
My take on this is that the best way to 

2054
01:44:54,640 --> 01:44:56,771
get radical progress is stopped worrying
about the median individual worried 

2055
01:44:56,771 --> 01:45:00,781
about the tiny number of people who 
break new ground for everybody and then 

2056
01:45:00,781 --> 01:45:03,410
you find that a hell of a thing for a 
leftist to say,

2057
01:45:03,830 --> 01:45:08,830
but I mean this goes back to and back 
those back to the problem I laid out at 

2058
01:45:08,830 --> 01:45:12,821
the beginning is that if you're going to
pursue things of value in a social 

2059
01:45:12,821 --> 01:45:16,751
environment,
you're gonna produce a hierarchy and 

2060
01:45:16,751 --> 01:45:16,751
there's going to be hyper productivity 
at the pinnacle of the hierarchy.

2061
01:45:16,751 --> 01:45:19,100
It's a big problem,
but if you want to produce things,

2062
01:45:19,101 --> 01:45:20,720
that's the problem you have to contend 
with.

2063
01:45:21,140 --> 01:45:26,140
And so it is the case that in most 
fields that are attempting to advance 

2064
01:45:26,140 --> 01:45:30,881
rapidly that it's a very tiny proportion
of people who are doing the advancing 

2065
01:45:30,881 --> 01:45:30,881
and how could it be otherwise?
Well,

2066
01:45:30,881 --> 01:45:32,720
but because oTherwise everybody would 
find the advanced.

2067
01:45:32,721 --> 01:45:33,170
so,
you know,

2068
01:45:33,171 --> 01:45:35,060
I have this trick.
It was a good measure.

2069
01:45:35,090 --> 01:45:35,870
Well,
here's another one.

2070
01:45:36,830 --> 01:45:39,980
You asked the leaders in the field,
uh,

2071
01:45:40,850 --> 01:45:44,900
effectively who they would block,
but they will not publicly short.

2072
01:45:46,700 --> 01:45:49,010
So in other words,
yeah,

2073
01:45:49,650 --> 01:45:51,590
joe's on some crazy tangent.
A,

2074
01:45:51,710 --> 01:45:54,790
he's wasting the department's resources 
or you know,

2075
01:45:55,460 --> 01:46:00,460
jane fundamentally doesn't play well on 
this team and the,

2076
01:46:00,650 --> 01:46:02,480
I think we need to send her a strong 
message.

2077
01:46:03,170 --> 01:46:08,170
Okay,
well why don't we say something 

2078
01:46:08,170 --> 01:46:08,170
publicly,
but I don't know.

2079
01:46:08,170 --> 01:46:08,170
I don't want to say that.

2080
01:46:08,170 --> 01:46:09,050
Why is it you don't want to say 
something.

2081
01:46:09,230 --> 01:46:14,230
Well,
because you're frightened that that 

2082
01:46:14,230 --> 01:46:14,230
person has you on the losing end of 
history.

2083
01:46:14,660 --> 01:46:17,420
So you're tryIng to block that person in
private,

2084
01:46:17,690 --> 01:46:22,690
but you won't short them in public.
So you use the people who fundamentally 

2085
01:46:22,690 --> 01:46:26,951
are the regular establishment to tell 
you who the most dangerous people are.

2086
01:46:27,300 --> 01:46:32,300
When you get those people money and you 
try to decrease transparency and 

2087
01:46:32,300 --> 01:46:36,140
accountability because giving people 
freedom.

2088
01:46:36,410 --> 01:46:41,410
The old part of this bargain was,
it's not the best paid career in the 

2089
01:46:41,410 --> 01:46:42,110
world,
but you do end up with freedom.

2090
01:46:42,140 --> 01:46:45,380
The ability to know is the and that's 
gone and that's gone.

2091
01:46:45,410 --> 01:46:47,220
They ethics committees have killed that.
Well,

2092
01:46:47,510 --> 01:46:49,380
my point is,
is the accuracies if killed,

2093
01:46:49,390 --> 01:46:54,390
it's gotten so bad man,
but it is our job to rally for 

2094
01:46:54,390 --> 01:46:58,140
unaccountability at a very high level.
Lack of transparencY.

2095
01:46:58,380 --> 01:46:59,490
You can laugh,
but let's.

2096
01:46:59,500 --> 01:47:01,410
Let's go through this,
right?

2097
01:47:01,680 --> 01:47:06,680
The fact is when you have a slush fund 
and you can make decisions that you 

2098
01:47:06,680 --> 01:47:09,000
don't have to justify based on an h 
index or a citation counter,

2099
01:47:09,001 --> 01:47:14,001
any of these poison metrics,
you get people who are able to make use 

2100
01:47:14,001 --> 01:47:16,530
of what we still have over places like 
China.

2101
01:47:17,060 --> 01:47:19,830
That's What we have over a place like 
China is we're a little bit richer.

2102
01:47:19,860 --> 01:47:21,760
not much,
maybe so we can,

2103
01:47:22,410 --> 01:47:24,390
but we're freer and that's mIddle 
finger.

2104
01:47:24,810 --> 01:47:26,580
That's less middle finger.
Well,

2105
01:47:26,581 --> 01:47:29,060
that's disagreeableness there yet.
Well,

2106
01:47:29,120 --> 01:47:31,500
I know,
and I mean you were the one who knows me

2107
01:47:31,501 --> 01:47:35,070
over dinner over my tenure is necessary 
because you could say,

2108
01:47:35,071 --> 01:47:36,660
well,
I'm 95,

2109
01:47:37,110 --> 01:47:42,110
I don't believe this,
but you could say 95 percent of people 

2110
01:47:42,110 --> 01:47:45,021
waste tenure.
They take advantage of it and I would 

2111
01:47:45,021 --> 01:47:45,021
say that's fine.

2112
01:47:45,021 --> 01:47:48,080
As long as the five percent who are 
taking advantage of it have their 

2113
01:47:48,080 --> 01:47:50,350
freedom hyper produCed and justify all 
the rest of them.

2114
01:47:50,460 --> 01:47:53,150
Nobody has real tenure because real 
tenure,

2115
01:47:53,190 --> 01:47:58,190
academic freedom was first of all 
sacrificed by the association of 

2116
01:47:58,190 --> 01:48:01,911
american universities,
aau in 1953 at the height of the cold 

2117
01:48:01,911 --> 01:48:03,900
war in the face of the rosenberg.
Who's so fIrst of all,

2118
01:48:03,930 --> 01:48:05,190
let's be very,
very honest.

2119
01:48:05,191 --> 01:48:10,191
The trade group that represents the 
nation's top institutions of higher 

2120
01:48:10,191 --> 01:48:13,671
learning,
the research universities fucked up and 

2121
01:48:13,671 --> 01:48:15,420
they killed something and I don't swear 
very often.

2122
01:48:15,600 --> 01:48:19,730
This is very important.
They sacrificed academic freedom,

2123
01:48:19,830 --> 01:48:23,310
freedom on an altar when they were 
facing something like we're,

2124
01:48:23,430 --> 01:48:27,960
we're facing with left carthy is right 
when they were facing real mccarthyism,

2125
01:48:28,290 --> 01:48:32,550
they buckled and the einsteins of the 
world stood up.

2126
01:48:33,120 --> 01:48:36,690
There's a beautiful testimony of a guy 
who was facing senator mccarthy.

2127
01:48:37,230 --> 01:48:38,010
Uh,
he says,

2128
01:48:38,011 --> 01:48:43,011
well,
I was just talking to my friend albert 

2129
01:48:43,011 --> 01:48:43,011
einstein.
You can see in the transcript.

2130
01:48:43,011 --> 01:48:43,011
He's like,
excuse me,

2131
01:48:43,011 --> 01:48:45,150
your friend albert einstein?
And einstein said,

2132
01:48:45,151 --> 01:48:50,151
look,
you have to be prepared to lose your 

2133
01:48:50,151 --> 01:48:53,001
salary,
lose your livelihood if you're going to 

2134
01:48:53,001 --> 01:48:55,341
be a true intellectual.
Now the fact of the matter is disagree 

2135
01:48:55,341 --> 01:48:57,120
ability needs to make a massive warring 
comeback.

2136
01:48:58,200 --> 01:49:03,200
Right?
And one of the things I think is just 

2137
01:49:03,200 --> 01:49:05,751
fascinating is how many top departments 
have invited bret weinstein to give a 

2138
01:49:05,751 --> 01:49:10,371
talk on evolutionary theory after 
watching him tossed out by the radical 

2139
01:49:10,371 --> 01:49:12,060
departments?
Expect the answer to that is zero.

2140
01:49:12,210 --> 01:49:15,420
It's almost zero.
I don't know that it may be zero.

2141
01:49:15,690 --> 01:49:18,420
So is so with lindsay shepherd,
her claim for,

2142
01:49:18,421 --> 01:49:23,421
with wilfred laurier is that the 
controversy there is controversy has 

2143
01:49:23,421 --> 01:49:24,150
made her permanently unemployable with.
And when I read that,

2144
01:49:24,151 --> 01:49:25,740
I thought that's,
that's correct,

2145
01:49:25,741 --> 01:49:30,741
because no hiring committee will take a 
risk on anybody touched who did green 

2146
01:49:30,741 --> 01:49:30,741
fluorescent protein.

2147
01:49:30,820 --> 01:49:32,880
Uh,
he was supposed to get a nobel prize for

2148
01:49:32,881 --> 01:49:37,881
it.
He was acknowledged by the three guys 

2149
01:49:37,881 --> 01:49:37,881
who did as the fourth guy,
they flew them to Sweden.

2150
01:49:37,881 --> 01:49:39,810
And what is he doing?
He immediately,

2151
01:49:39,811 --> 01:49:44,811
afterwards,
he was driving a shuttle bus in 

2152
01:49:44,811 --> 01:49:44,811
huntsville,
Alabama.

2153
01:49:44,811 --> 01:49:48,470
One year later after the New York times 
a covered doug pressure story was still 

2154
01:49:48,470 --> 01:49:50,530
driving a shuttle bus in huntsville,
Alabama,

2155
01:49:50,890 --> 01:49:55,890
talking about margo tool at mit who 
stood up against david baltimore and a 

2156
01:49:55,890 --> 01:49:57,600
theresa and issue shikari,
you know,

2157
01:49:58,150 --> 01:50:00,730
destroyed.
Now my question is,

2158
01:50:00,790 --> 01:50:03,160
hey,
where are the universities?

2159
01:50:03,161 --> 01:50:06,730
Is it the university of chicago?
Is it down to the university of chicago?

2160
01:50:07,270 --> 01:50:09,100
Where are the places?
Chicago?

2161
01:50:09,101 --> 01:50:10,390
If you're out there,
you know,

2162
01:50:10,840 --> 01:50:14,950
w w we need you.
We need fundamentally strong departments

2163
01:50:14,951 --> 01:50:18,040
and weak administrations.
This is absolutely critical.

2164
01:50:18,041 --> 01:50:19,960
Is that anything on that's on?
Okay,

2165
01:50:20,320 --> 01:50:23,860
we need an accountability.
We need strong professors,

2166
01:50:23,890 --> 01:50:26,920
we need strong departments,
we need weak administrations.

2167
01:50:27,070 --> 01:50:29,650
We need to get people tenure radically 
earlier,

2168
01:50:29,920 --> 01:50:31,570
like in their twenties,
late twenties,

2169
01:50:31,571 --> 01:50:36,571
early thirties.
We need when people have the ability to 

2170
01:50:36,571 --> 01:50:39,841
make great new ideas,
this is not appreciated and the fact 

2171
01:50:39,841 --> 01:50:43,771
that fundamentally nobody can hear bret 
weinstein who has great interesting 

2172
01:50:43,771 --> 01:50:45,400
theories and you want to shoot them down
by all means,

2173
01:50:45,520 --> 01:50:47,740
but you won't invite him to give a 
seminar on his,

2174
01:50:47,770 --> 01:50:52,770
on his work at a time like this.
This is absolute madness and I'm so you 

2175
01:50:52,770 --> 01:50:54,250
know,
what a privilege to be able to deal with

2176
01:50:54,251 --> 01:50:59,251
our tiny group of people who can 
actually open their throat and say find 

2177
01:50:59,251 --> 01:51:00,940
a much larger audience than he would 
have gotten any other way.

2178
01:51:01,000 --> 01:51:02,290
Well,
that's exactly what I was gonna say.

2179
01:51:02,291 --> 01:51:07,291
Maybe marketing this all the way back 
and then let's do one more thing and 

2180
01:51:07,291 --> 01:51:10,561
then we're going to bring in shapiro,
but maybe that brings us back to where 

2181
01:51:10,561 --> 01:51:10,561
we started about this.

2182
01:51:10,561 --> 01:51:13,450
The speed of technology,
the amount of people that can listen and

2183
01:51:13,451 --> 01:51:15,910
watch and all of that and that what 
brett may find.

2184
01:51:16,090 --> 01:51:21,090
I just brought bread up in front of a 
sold out comedy club in bellevue and he 

2185
01:51:21,090 --> 01:51:22,300
got,
when I just mentioned his name,

2186
01:51:22,301 --> 01:51:27,301
he got a standing ovation.
How many of those people edit journals 

2187
01:51:27,301 --> 01:51:27,760
of evolutionary theory so we have to get
it to them.

2188
01:51:27,761 --> 01:51:32,761
I get it.
It's a different set that are watching 

2189
01:51:32,761 --> 01:51:34,660
this right now to be sad.
There's something to be said even so on.

2190
01:51:34,670 --> 01:51:39,670
The question front is rough,
but there's something to be said for 

2191
01:51:39,670 --> 01:51:42,451
being able to bring your scientific 
expertise to a mass audience who are 

2192
01:51:42,451 --> 01:51:43,570
actually interested in the content of 
your discourse,

2193
01:51:43,870 --> 01:51:45,380
so I'm not saying it's.
It's,

2194
01:51:45,410 --> 01:51:47,860
it's,
it's the revolution in the journals that

2195
01:51:47,861 --> 01:51:50,140
might be necessary,
but it's not nothing.

2196
01:51:50,410 --> 01:51:51,140
It's and it,
it,

2197
01:51:51,160 --> 01:51:51,750
it,
it,

2198
01:51:51,751 --> 01:51:55,300
it looks like there's the possibility of
bringing these things directly to a mass

2199
01:51:55,301 --> 01:51:56,390
audience that's appreciated.

2200
01:51:56,390 --> 01:52:01,390
I appreciate that,
but the thing that nobody gets about 

2201
01:52:01,390 --> 01:52:03,460
what we're doing,
because I spend my time attacking a most

2202
01:52:03,461 --> 01:52:08,461
of the things I'm trying to save.
I want to save the New York times from 

2203
01:52:09,041 --> 01:52:10,900
itself.
I want to save the university.

2204
01:52:10,901 --> 01:52:13,200
How old are you?
50 to do,

2205
01:52:13,340 --> 01:52:18,340
you don't have enough time left to do 
spoken like a baby boomer and my friend,

2206
01:52:19,240 --> 01:52:20,470
he might know kurzweil,
you know,

2207
01:52:23,050 --> 01:52:26,140
what we need to do is either cure it or 
kill it.

2208
01:52:27,190 --> 01:52:29,380
These things need to.
We can let it kill itself,

2209
01:52:29,920 --> 01:52:33,070
which it seems to be.
I don't have time for that.

2210
01:52:33,270 --> 01:52:34,770
And,
and it's not a pretty death.

2211
01:52:34,810 --> 01:52:37,210
No.
And the fact of the matter is,

2212
01:52:37,211 --> 01:52:40,510
is that it's crowding out what's next 
and so fundamentally,

2213
01:52:40,511 --> 01:52:42,310
if it can be saved,
if they can be saved,

2214
01:52:42,311 --> 01:52:44,620
they need to be saved and if they can't 
be saved,

2215
01:52:44,621 --> 01:52:46,100
if they want to keep their

2216
01:52:46,970 --> 01:52:51,150
finger on the scales and push everything
in this direction and the cowardice is a

2217
01:52:51,350 --> 01:52:53,540
palpable everywhere.
Um,

2218
01:52:53,870 --> 01:52:56,570
it's important that they stopped 
crowding out what's next?

2219
01:52:56,990 --> 01:53:00,260
And I think that that's the major 
decision and you know,

2220
01:53:00,261 --> 01:53:02,960
quite the thing to market the 
marketplace might make that decision for

2221
01:53:02,961 --> 01:53:03,680
them.
We'll see.

2222
01:53:03,980 --> 01:53:05,480
We'll see.
Maybe it'll be fast.

2223
01:53:05,510 --> 01:53:07,520
Maybe it'd be fast enough.
So let's,

2224
01:53:07,521 --> 01:53:09,620
let's do one other thing before shapiro 
is gonna.

2225
01:53:09,621 --> 01:53:10,100
Join us.
We're gonna.

2226
01:53:10,120 --> 01:53:12,440
Take a little break and have lunch and 
then shapiro is going to jump in here.

2227
01:53:13,100 --> 01:53:18,100
So I thought this would be a good segue 
too to him because we haven't done that 

2228
01:53:18,100 --> 01:53:20,330
much political snap right here.
Is this,

2229
01:53:20,630 --> 01:53:23,060
is this a political movement?

2230
01:53:25,250 --> 01:53:27,560
Is this the beginnings of a political 
movement?

2231
01:53:27,980 --> 01:53:28,350
No,
I,

2232
01:53:28,351 --> 01:53:30,770
I don't think so.
I think what it is is the,

2233
01:53:31,010 --> 01:53:33,350
is the,
is that conduct,

2234
01:53:33,470 --> 01:53:38,090
it's the conducting of proper political 
discourse and maybe you could say,

2235
01:53:38,091 --> 01:53:43,091
well it would be a political movement to
foster the conducting of proper 

2236
01:53:43,091 --> 01:53:44,330
political discourse.
ThAt's possible,

2237
01:53:44,331 --> 01:53:47,150
but it's a strange political movement 
because it's a political movement that's

2238
01:53:47,151 --> 01:53:49,640
concentrating on process rather than,
than,

2239
01:53:49,730 --> 01:53:50,480
than,
than,

2240
01:53:50,810 --> 01:53:51,990
than content.
Yeah.

2241
01:53:52,180 --> 01:53:55,220
Um,
I think that partly what I'm doIng in my

2242
01:53:55,310 --> 01:53:58,910
tour is the fostering of genuine 
discourse,

2243
01:53:59,600 --> 01:54:04,600
but I don't think that's as political.
I don't think of that as a political 

2244
01:54:04,600 --> 01:54:07,331
movement.
I think of it as a psychological 

2245
01:54:07,331 --> 01:54:07,331
movement or.
Yeah.

2246
01:54:07,331 --> 01:54:08,420
Or it,
I don't know,

2247
01:54:09,260 --> 01:54:12,380
our constitutional principles in the 
political domain.

2248
01:54:12,440 --> 01:54:17,440
I would say no.
they're outside the political domain 

2249
01:54:17,440 --> 01:54:17,440
because they're axiom,
so they're inside some other domain.

2250
01:54:17,440 --> 01:54:20,120
They're inside a philosophical domain or
a theological domain,

2251
01:54:20,420 --> 01:54:24,710
and I think a discussion that's 
associated with proper political process

2252
01:54:24,711 --> 01:54:29,711
isn't a political discussion.
I think it's a meta political 

2253
01:54:29,711 --> 01:54:29,711
discussion.
It would be what a better way to ask the

2254
01:54:29,711 --> 01:54:34,271
question and then b,
do we just need a political party or a 

2255
01:54:34,271 --> 01:54:37,691
political group or a politician or 
whatever to just pick up on this and 

2256
01:54:37,691 --> 01:54:40,100
then incorporate it so that it's not a 
movement in and of itself.

2257
01:54:40,101 --> 01:54:40,900
I understand what you're saying.
Well,

2258
01:54:40,910 --> 01:54:42,530
I've been.
I went and talked to,

2259
01:54:42,590 --> 01:54:43,580
um,
uh,

2260
01:54:43,610 --> 01:54:45,830
what's the name of that group turning 
point in America?

2261
01:54:45,831 --> 01:54:48,350
I went and talked to everybody who was a
turning point usa.

2262
01:54:48,351 --> 01:54:50,480
I went and talked to their women's 
meeting.

2263
01:54:50,481 --> 01:54:52,670
They had about 1200 women down in,
uh,

2264
01:54:52,970 --> 01:54:57,970
we were in dallas and one of the things 
I recommended to them was that instead 

2265
01:54:57,970 --> 01:55:00,530
of concentrating on the content of the 
radiology,

2266
01:55:00,531 --> 01:55:02,230
because they're branding themselves in 
some senses,

2267
01:55:02,231 --> 01:55:07,231
the conservative movement that they 
devote themselves to educating 

2268
01:55:07,231 --> 01:55:10,811
themselves as much as they possibly can 
because they're going to produce a much 

2269
01:55:10,811 --> 01:55:15,671
bigger impact by becoming better 
individuals than they are by promoting 

2270
01:55:15,671 --> 01:55:15,860
conservative doctrine.

2271
01:55:16,040 --> 01:55:21,040
That's what it looks like to me,
even though there's some utility in 

2272
01:55:21,040 --> 01:55:21,440
promoting conservative doctrine on the 
campuses,

2273
01:55:21,441 --> 01:55:26,441
at least as a counterbalance to the 
overwhelming preponderance of radical 

2274
01:55:26,441 --> 01:55:27,910
leftist thinking.
but I don't,

2275
01:55:27,911 --> 01:55:32,911
I don't think the fundamental movement 
necessarily necessary here is political 

2276
01:55:32,911 --> 01:55:34,310
because I think the political is 
actually part of the problem.

2277
01:55:34,970 --> 01:55:36,920
So that's,
that's how it looks to me.

2278
01:55:37,620 --> 01:55:42,620
I think we're,
the advanced group said to send to take 

2279
01:55:42,620 --> 01:55:44,040
a hill for a healthy political discourse

2280
01:55:44,040 --> 01:55:46,890
that follows us.
That's hopefully that,

2281
01:55:46,891 --> 01:55:47,490
that,
you know,

2282
01:55:48,010 --> 01:55:50,570
situations turning point usa.
Uh,

2283
01:55:50,850 --> 01:55:55,850
you know,
I was shocked that charlie kirk and 

2284
01:55:55,850 --> 01:55:57,180
candice owens reached out to me and I 
was like,

2285
01:55:57,220 --> 01:55:59,850
you,
you do understand who I am.

2286
01:56:00,780 --> 01:56:05,780
And I'm very confused by it because I 
find that a lot of the rhetoric that 

2287
01:56:05,780 --> 01:56:10,551
comes out of that absolutely unpalatable
and the private discourse is much more 

2288
01:56:10,981 --> 01:56:14,010
sympathetic,
much more understanding.

2289
01:56:14,070 --> 01:56:19,070
I think that the political,
some of that's a lack of sophistication 

2290
01:56:19,070 --> 01:56:22,220
actually on,
on the part of the people who are doing 

2291
01:56:22,220 --> 01:56:24,321
it.
But I think we can move those guys 

2292
01:56:24,321 --> 01:56:26,121
because just for the record,
I just want to say that when they 

2293
01:56:26,121 --> 01:56:26,121
invited me to speaking gigs,
charlie said to me from day one,

2294
01:56:26,121 --> 01:56:28,530
he said,
I disagree with you on a ton of stuff,

2295
01:56:28,531 --> 01:56:31,620
but I want to invite you here to speak.
And I go up there and I talk about being

2296
01:56:31,621 --> 01:56:34,860
gay married and pro choice then faculty 
and all of these things.

2297
01:56:34,860 --> 01:56:36,790
And they give me a standing ovation.
So yeah,

2298
01:56:36,810 --> 01:56:38,120
but the.
But then the problem is,

2299
01:56:38,121 --> 01:56:43,121
is that nobody can figure out why I'm 
talking to candace owens because when 

2300
01:56:43,121 --> 01:56:45,090
she's going in red meat conservative 
mode,

2301
01:56:45,510 --> 01:56:47,940
I don't recognize the same person who 
reached out to me.

2302
01:56:47,941 --> 01:56:50,040
And you know,
I don't think it is the same person.

2303
01:56:50,041 --> 01:56:52,320
Exactly.
I think that there's a fractionation,

2304
01:56:52,321 --> 01:56:57,321
they're as interested because of the 
niche and the idea is that there is not 

2305
01:56:57,321 --> 01:56:59,490
yet a niche.
This came up with Douglas Murray.

2306
01:56:59,491 --> 01:57:04,491
It's a super important point in general.
People are in a restrictionist mood on 

2307
01:57:04,491 --> 01:57:08,490
immigration and they want more 
protection is with respect to trade.

2308
01:57:08,970 --> 01:57:13,970
And the question like,
let's take within an immigration is why 

2309
01:57:13,970 --> 01:57:15,300
is it that no politician finds it easy 
to exploit,

2310
01:57:15,840 --> 01:57:20,840
um,
this without going completely far right 

2311
01:57:20,840 --> 01:57:25,010
or completely open borders,
like either it's ethno nationalism or 

2312
01:57:25,010 --> 01:57:25,560
it's all people are equal.

2313
01:57:25,560 --> 01:57:27,660
Why should we dIscriminate from people 
in any other country?

2314
01:57:28,260 --> 01:57:30,260
The sensible positions are 
uninhabitable.

2315
01:57:30,660 --> 01:57:35,660
So the question is why.
And so the claim that I'm making is you 

2316
01:57:35,660 --> 01:57:36,780
have to really know your stuff at the 
moment.

2317
01:57:36,840 --> 01:57:40,980
If you're going to hold a position like 
we cannot be easy a phobic,

2318
01:57:41,190 --> 01:57:44,010
we have to be somewhat restrictionist.
We cannot close the borders.

2319
01:57:44,040 --> 01:57:45,140
Immigration,
I mean,

2320
01:57:45,160 --> 01:57:46,860
I particularly want to put your finger 
on it.

2321
01:57:46,861 --> 01:57:48,990
You have to know your stuff to hold that
position,

2322
01:57:48,991 --> 01:57:51,210
but you shouldn't have to know it at 
this level.

2323
01:57:51,270 --> 01:57:51,900
I mean,
in other words,

2324
01:57:51,901 --> 01:57:56,901
to work I had to do to figure out what 
the hell happened with technical and 

2325
01:57:56,901 --> 01:58:00,651
scientific immigration is a hidden study
from 1986 that nobody outside in the 

2326
01:58:01,561 --> 01:58:06,561
outside world knew about.
Nobody can devote two years of their 

2327
01:58:06,561 --> 01:58:07,110
life generically in order to figure 
these things out.

2328
01:58:07,410 --> 01:58:11,910
So the problem is we have to actually 
take out the ground for the middle,

2329
01:58:12,840 --> 01:58:17,840
get rid of the crazies on both ends and 
have an idea that fundamentally,

2330
01:58:18,660 --> 01:58:22,530
or at least stopped the crazies from 
taking out the reasonable people.

2331
01:58:22,650 --> 01:58:25,950
That's the issue with.
I don't we are stopping the craziest.

2332
01:58:25,960 --> 01:58:28,560
That's like,
well probably not because they're always

2333
01:58:28,561 --> 01:58:33,561
there,
but getting their hands from around the 

2334
01:58:33,561 --> 01:58:33,561
necks of the people who are sensible 
would be a useful,

2335
01:58:33,561 --> 01:58:38,331
at least intermediary stop.
I have learned painfully that I have 

2336
01:58:38,331 --> 01:58:40,170
more in common with what would now be 
considered center.

2337
01:58:40,171 --> 01:58:42,130
Right?
Than do with radical

2338
01:58:42,610 --> 01:58:43,180
left.
Yeah.

2339
01:58:43,360 --> 01:58:47,360
And so this idea of reaching across the 
aisle and saying you,

2340
01:58:47,420 --> 01:58:52,420
you take out your trash,
I'll take out my right is a very 

2341
01:58:52,420 --> 01:58:54,450
important move that is not happening.
And so that's.

2342
01:58:54,480 --> 01:58:58,540
but that's one of the things that's 
weird about the candice own charlie kirk

2343
01:58:58,541 --> 01:59:02,380
situation is like when I went to the 
aspen ideas festival,

2344
01:59:02,410 --> 01:59:06,100
the people who invited me there,
I wouldn't say we're there not canonical

2345
01:59:06,101 --> 01:59:11,101
members of the commentary.
There are people who are feeling 

2346
01:59:11,101 --> 01:59:14,131
tremendous pressure and that's partly 
why they invited me and I did get 

2347
01:59:14,131 --> 01:59:14,131
invited,
but,

2348
01:59:14,270 --> 01:59:16,540
and then I discussed the things that I 
was discussing,

2349
01:59:16,840 --> 01:59:19,480
but I wouldn't say that I felt welcome 
there at all.

2350
01:59:19,630 --> 01:59:24,630
And so one of The things that's weird 
about going to talk to these 

2351
01:59:24,630 --> 01:59:27,091
conservative groups,
it's like I went down to dallas and I 

2352
01:59:27,091 --> 01:59:28,300
talked to these women and I like,
I didn't give a conservative talk.

2353
01:59:28,870 --> 01:59:31,390
I gave this talk that I'm having right 
now.

2354
01:59:31,420 --> 01:59:32,980
And,
but they were,

2355
01:59:33,550 --> 01:59:38,550
they were conservative,
but at the same time they were actually 

2356
01:59:38,550 --> 01:59:39,640
listening to what I was saying and they 
were receptive to it.

2357
01:59:39,641 --> 01:59:41,890
and so then when I go to the talk to the
leftist types,

2358
01:59:41,891 --> 01:59:46,090
it's like that,
that there are ideologically possessed,

2359
01:59:46,120 --> 01:59:48,460
let's say in the same manner,
but they're not open at all.

2360
01:59:48,461 --> 01:59:49,000
Okay.
But,

2361
01:59:49,120 --> 01:59:51,460
but I experienced something slightly 
different.

2362
01:59:51,550 --> 01:59:53,410
I,
I see exactly this,

2363
01:59:53,470 --> 01:59:58,470
I'm more welcoming center right circles 
than I am in even center left circles 

2364
01:59:58,470 --> 02:00:00,400
because of the contamination has gotten 
much farther from,

2365
02:00:00,730 --> 02:00:02,470
from the extreme into the center and the
left.

2366
02:00:03,190 --> 02:00:05,820
But there's still this other thing like,
you know,

2367
02:00:05,860 --> 02:00:08,420
I heard the word lib,
tarred and I'm just like,

2368
02:00:08,530 --> 02:00:09,910
oh,
for christ's sake,

2369
02:00:09,970 --> 02:00:11,450
really,
you know.

2370
02:00:11,500 --> 02:00:13,390
Oh,
you want to enslave everybody?

2371
02:00:13,391 --> 02:00:14,200
Oh,
your monster.

2372
02:00:14,201 --> 02:00:14,800
Turn on you.

2373
02:00:14,800 --> 02:00:15,670
And I just think,
okay,

2374
02:00:15,910 --> 02:00:20,620
this is some preprogrammed set of moves.
And you know,

2375
02:00:21,310 --> 02:00:26,310
in your comment section,
there is much more of this stuff that 

2376
02:00:26,621 --> 02:00:30,280
I'm used to in other people's comments.
Something about actions or not.

2377
02:00:30,470 --> 02:00:30,690
No,
no,

2378
02:00:30,710 --> 02:00:35,710
no,
but I'm saying something about your 

2379
02:00:35,710 --> 02:00:35,710
audience that somewhere in your 
evolution,

2380
02:00:35,820 --> 02:00:39,220
um,
you have to watch the fact that there is

2381
02:00:39,221 --> 02:00:43,090
this increase in the incivility on the 
right.

2382
02:00:43,240 --> 02:00:43,830
And,
you know,

2383
02:00:43,980 --> 02:00:47,170
I focus my energy on the left because 
it's my responsibility.

2384
02:00:47,410 --> 02:00:49,540
I don't think the right is my 
responsibility,

2385
02:00:50,170 --> 02:00:55,170
but while these people are struggling 
with the same prOblem you laid out at 

2386
02:00:55,170 --> 02:00:55,600
the beginning though,
it's like we can,

2387
02:00:55,601 --> 02:00:58,900
we can make the case for civility and 
should but,

2388
02:00:59,080 --> 02:01:00,010
but you say,
well,

2389
02:01:00,011 --> 02:01:02,830
tHe civility only goes so far until you 
defend yourself.

2390
02:01:02,831 --> 02:01:03,370
It's like,
yeah,

2391
02:01:03,371 --> 02:01:06,730
well that's a big problem.
It's like exactly how far does it go and

2392
02:01:06,731 --> 02:01:09,790
then how do you defend youRself and when
you're defending yourself,

2393
02:01:09,791 --> 02:01:11,050
what strategies to use.

2394
02:01:11,230 --> 02:01:12,370
Now,
one of the things I learned,

2395
02:01:12,371 --> 02:01:15,250
and I talked about this with dave last 
night and it's something I think that we

2396
02:01:15,251 --> 02:01:17,920
should think about as members of this 
loose group,

2397
02:01:17,921 --> 02:01:22,921
is that you don't defend yourself more 
than is absolutely neCessary,

2398
02:01:23,440 --> 02:01:25,660
right?
It's a minimal necessary force.

2399
02:01:25,950 --> 02:01:30,950
A doctorate is the correct one and so 
lived hard and that sort of thing could 

2400
02:01:30,950 --> 02:01:33,490
probably be shelved as ineffective and 
counter productive.

2401
02:01:33,940 --> 02:01:38,940
Right.
Although part of the reason that it's 

2402
02:01:38,940 --> 02:01:40,891
coming up at least in part,
isn't an attempt to ineffective and 

2403
02:01:40,891 --> 02:01:42,170
counterproductive.
It's offensive and stupid.

2404
02:01:42,710 --> 02:01:43,140
Well,
okay,

2405
02:01:43,490 --> 02:01:44,690
that's fine.
That's fine.

2406
02:01:44,720 --> 02:01:45,880
That's fine.
But,

2407
02:01:46,110 --> 02:01:49,850
but my point is it's actually,
it's actually technically complicated.

2408
02:01:49,851 --> 02:01:54,851
It's like it's not that easy to mount an
effective defense that isn't 

2409
02:01:54,851 --> 02:01:59,501
simultaneously and attack like you have 
to be very like I want to push you back 

2410
02:01:59,870 --> 02:02:02,750
just far enough so your back,
but no farther.

2411
02:02:03,020 --> 02:02:05,780
It's like,
I mean that's worked out in my situation

2412
02:02:05,781 --> 02:02:10,610
so far because generally when I've been 
a dark publicly in the press,

2413
02:02:10,760 --> 02:02:15,760
even in interviews,
I'd been able to use minimal necessary 

2414
02:02:15,760 --> 02:02:17,030
force and every time that's happened 
it's worked.

2415
02:02:17,330 --> 02:02:18,980
And so one of the things I would 
recommend,

2416
02:02:18,981 --> 02:02:22,460
and this would be to your listeners and 
viewers and props to mind as well,

2417
02:02:22,580 --> 02:02:27,580
perhaps two years,
is that don't push back any harder than 

2418
02:02:28,011 --> 02:02:31,440
you have to write because it's.
It gets rapidly do it,

2419
02:02:31,441 --> 02:02:32,440
are balanced fashion.

2420
02:02:32,860 --> 02:02:35,330
A typical thing is if somebody's going 
to come on gang busters,

2421
02:02:35,331 --> 02:02:39,370
like you have three opportunities are so
to cut it out and they refuse to it,

2422
02:02:39,410 --> 02:02:40,100
you know?
Yeah.

2423
02:02:40,110 --> 02:02:44,140
I liked the rule of three.
You've been telling them to the curb and

2424
02:02:44,141 --> 02:02:46,690
then I offer them a hand up.
Then the question is,

2425
02:02:48,190 --> 02:02:53,190
okay,
are going to bite the hand up then and 

2426
02:02:53,190 --> 02:02:54,990
then we have a further problem because 
now you're just on some sort of 

2427
02:02:54,990 --> 02:02:57,511
unbounded,
the descent into hell and I'm not 

2428
02:02:57,511 --> 02:02:59,110
interested in following you there,
but I think that what's really going on,

2429
02:02:59,111 --> 02:03:04,111
and this is the hardest point to make,
is that we need to new sort of 

2430
02:03:05,920 --> 02:03:10,920
hermaphroditic parties that combined 
elements of right and left the don't 

2431
02:03:10,920 --> 02:03:15,400
look like the terrible situation that we
inherited from the baby boomers.

2432
02:03:15,401 --> 02:03:16,940
No offense sir.
Um,

2433
02:03:17,140 --> 02:03:22,060
where for a very long period of time 
we've been under one group,

2434
02:03:22,300 --> 02:03:27,300
a group set of ideas that are crashing 
and burning and whatever the new thing 

2435
02:03:29,141 --> 02:03:32,440
that replaces right and the new thing 
that replaces left is,

2436
02:03:32,880 --> 02:03:35,680
is going to have combinations of these 
things.

2437
02:03:35,680 --> 02:03:38,650
And so for example,
maybe situation specific,

2438
02:03:38,680 --> 02:03:43,680
well differentiated.
Every smart person I know is pro market.

2439
02:03:44,240 --> 02:03:46,450
The key question is,
do you believe that the market should be

2440
02:03:46,480 --> 02:03:49,840
allowed to do everything?
Like you get these very purest things.

2441
02:03:49,850 --> 02:03:54,850
I am the,
I am an iron randy and I'm a guaranteed 

2442
02:03:54,850 --> 02:03:55,450
free markets here.
but then you put things in front of them

2443
02:03:55,451 --> 02:03:56,230
and you say,
look,

2444
02:03:56,740 --> 02:04:01,740
should physics be allowed to sign a 
licensing deal where we charge you for 

2445
02:04:01,740 --> 02:04:03,670
everything we've created,
like the semiconductor,

2446
02:04:04,310 --> 02:04:04,900
you know,
or,

2447
02:04:04,901 --> 02:04:06,940
or,
or the communications equipment that you

2448
02:04:07,020 --> 02:04:12,020
use to run your life.
because if you want to talk to me one 

2449
02:04:12,020 --> 02:04:14,281
more time about tax dollars for science,
I'm going to point out to you that 

2450
02:04:14,281 --> 02:04:16,570
you're breaking a compact that we had,
that you were going to support us and we

2451
02:04:16,571 --> 02:04:19,630
weren't going to charge charge you 
because we charge you.

2452
02:04:19,630 --> 02:04:24,630
We're going to be the ones with the 
yachts and the fourth homes and you're 

2453
02:04:24,630 --> 02:04:26,020
not going to be able to,
to pay your physics bill.

2454
02:04:26,260 --> 02:04:31,260
You know,
and the point of this is when you welsh 

2455
02:04:31,260 --> 02:04:31,350
on a contract and you start to say,
no,

2456
02:04:31,360 --> 02:04:31,600
no,
no,

2457
02:04:31,601 --> 02:04:33,340
it's the market.
Well guess what?

2458
02:04:33,390 --> 02:04:38,390
You know,
public goods are part of markets and 

2459
02:04:38,390 --> 02:04:38,390
they're very valuable and they're hard 
to get to pay for them.

2460
02:04:38,390 --> 02:04:40,470
And so you have to use some amount of 
violence,

2461
02:04:40,740 --> 02:04:43,170
right?
Weber's theory is that a government is a

2462
02:04:43,171 --> 02:04:45,720
monopoly on violence and that's why it 
exists.

2463
02:04:46,110 --> 02:04:51,110
When you have these very pure 
ideological positions that are not 

2464
02:04:51,110 --> 02:04:52,380
tutored by reality or deeper theory,
they are very,

2465
02:04:52,381 --> 02:04:57,381
very difficult to dislodge people from 
now because you are taking a ton of 

2466
02:04:57,381 --> 02:04:58,740
risk.
As a smaLl business owner,

2467
02:04:59,390 --> 02:05:04,390
you are going to be predisposed towards 
and libertarian mindset because you're 

2468
02:05:04,390 --> 02:05:06,240
not only making money from your hard 
work.

2469
02:05:06,240 --> 02:05:09,270
You're making money from the fact that 
you're taking on huge amounts of risk.

2470
02:05:09,570 --> 02:05:13,770
And when people don't identify risk 
management as a source of inequality,

2471
02:05:13,980 --> 02:05:15,930
we've got a problem.
On the other hand,

2472
02:05:16,440 --> 02:05:18,270
there are a ton of people I know in New 
York.

2473
02:05:18,271 --> 02:05:21,270
We're making money hand over fist by 
extracting it through rent,

2474
02:05:21,271 --> 02:05:26,271
seeking by putting themselves as the 
toll collector so that everybody's got 

2475
02:05:26,271 --> 02:05:29,841
to do business,
has to pay them off in some sort of 

2476
02:05:29,841 --> 02:05:29,841
legalized form of corruption.
And those people.

2477
02:05:29,841 --> 02:05:34,341
I fundamentally think we should have 
clawed back their property on long 

2478
02:05:34,341 --> 02:05:34,980
island and come up with clawback 
national seashore.

2479
02:05:35,370 --> 02:05:40,370
Uh,
when we bailed them out in the great 

2480
02:05:40,370 --> 02:05:43,910
recession and collapse in 2008 now,
well maybe we'll get lucky and you know,

2481
02:05:44,480 --> 02:05:49,480
and I'm thinking that the possibilities 
that these increasingly long form,

2482
02:05:50,180 --> 02:05:55,180
uh,
opportunities for communication and the 

2483
02:05:55,180 --> 02:05:57,831
rise of podcasts and the rise of audio 
books and all of that is going to 

2484
02:05:57,831 --> 02:06:01,791
produce a more educated and committed 
electorate and they will be 

2485
02:06:01,791 --> 02:06:06,380
sophisticated enough to start to sort 
out these problems without recourse to 

2486
02:06:06,380 --> 02:06:10,161
these ideological or with last recourse 
to these ideological overseas still 

2487
02:06:10,161 --> 02:06:10,350
fighting Jordan.

2488
02:06:10,350 --> 02:06:12,120
They're still,
they're still not coming.

2489
02:06:12,300 --> 02:06:17,300
I mean the number of people I know who 
are privately aware of me and publicly 

2490
02:06:17,300 --> 02:06:20,340
show no awareness of what I'm talking 
about.

2491
02:06:20,840 --> 02:06:23,040
A actually the same thing for you.
Well,

2492
02:06:23,041 --> 02:06:26,670
it's a running joke.
Tilting fast was much more for you.

2493
02:06:26,671 --> 02:06:31,671
I mean because I think by breaking it 
has to get there first and you broke 

2494
02:06:31,831 --> 02:06:36,831
through with the book and it was,
you're doing a different thing than 

2495
02:06:36,831 --> 02:06:40,700
anybody else in this network is doing.
But my point would be that they had to 

2496
02:06:40,700 --> 02:06:41,790
contend with you because they had a 
mystery,

2497
02:06:41,791 --> 02:06:44,840
which is why is there a number one 
bestseller,

2498
02:06:45,290 --> 02:06:47,100
um,
by somebody who's,

2499
02:06:47,350 --> 02:06:49,460
I mean,
how do we explain any amount of this,

2500
02:06:49,660 --> 02:06:51,430
dave,
it's just that I come to weddings,

2501
02:06:51,450 --> 02:06:53,640
availed my angry young white men 
followers,

2502
02:06:53,641 --> 02:06:55,580
but those aren't the people who are 
buying funny.

2503
02:06:55,740 --> 02:07:00,740
And I started taking pictures with all 
of the people of color and the talks are

2504
02:07:02,041 --> 02:07:06,240
up to about 40 percent women now and the
age at least at least the age.

2505
02:07:06,270 --> 02:07:10,380
The one thing I do see though is that 
lots of men come alone,

2506
02:07:10,470 --> 02:07:13,830
but very few women come alone.
But it's about 40 percent

2507
02:07:13,870 --> 02:07:18,870
women now.
And I'll tell you about the group of 

2508
02:07:18,870 --> 02:07:18,870
grandmothers that I met about a week or 
two ago.

2509
02:07:18,870 --> 02:07:20,440
I forget what city it was,
and there was this group of grandmothers

2510
02:07:20,560 --> 02:07:25,560
they get together and it was,
there was about nine or 10 of them and 

2511
02:07:25,560 --> 02:07:29,101
all in their sixties and seventies.
And they all love you and it draws in 

2512
02:07:29,101 --> 02:07:29,290
september.
Oh.

2513
02:07:29,291 --> 02:07:31,650
Then you'll get all right.
You

2514
02:07:31,680 --> 02:07:32,940
know,
one,

2515
02:07:33,050 --> 02:07:35,100
one kid came up to me and one of your 
talks and I said,

2516
02:07:35,470 --> 02:07:40,470
you know,
he started talking about how important 

2517
02:07:40,470 --> 02:07:40,470
it was that you were there.
And I said,

2518
02:07:40,470 --> 02:07:40,630
well,
what is this done for your life?

2519
02:07:40,660 --> 02:07:42,520
This is what has it done for my life.
He says,

2520
02:07:42,521 --> 02:07:43,000
you know,
I was,

2521
02:07:43,001 --> 02:07:45,460
uh,
I was at home smoking weed,

2522
02:07:45,461 --> 02:07:48,100
masturbating too much,
playing video games,

2523
02:07:48,550 --> 02:07:49,690
and,
you know,

2524
02:07:49,810 --> 02:07:53,410
six months later I've got a job,
a fiance,

2525
02:07:53,760 --> 02:07:55,500
um,
you know,

2526
02:07:55,501 --> 02:07:59,230
I think he had some gal who was not 
interested in because of his situation,

2527
02:07:59,231 --> 02:08:01,150
but liked him.
And he turned his life around.

2528
02:08:01,780 --> 02:08:06,780
And I thought,
this is partly what's so incredibly fun 

2529
02:08:06,780 --> 02:08:09,820
about these events is that people just 
tell that story over and over.

2530
02:08:09,821 --> 02:08:12,850
It's so fun because they come up to me 
and they say,

2531
02:08:12,851 --> 02:08:17,851
look,
here's six months ago I was having all 

2532
02:08:17,851 --> 02:08:17,851
these troubles and sometimes it's 
serious.

2533
02:08:17,851 --> 02:08:20,050
I was suicidal.
But what was really effective,

2534
02:08:20,060 --> 02:08:25,060
what really affected me about this 
conversation was nothing about this guy 

2535
02:08:25,270 --> 02:08:26,050
said,
loser.

2536
02:08:26,650 --> 02:08:31,650
and what,
what it told me is that some of the 

2537
02:08:31,650 --> 02:08:35,320
difficulties we've had in our markets,
particularly after post 2008,

2538
02:08:36,160 --> 02:08:41,160
there was this thing that worked less 
and less well over time and people who 

2539
02:08:41,160 --> 02:08:43,120
were college educated,
who were hard working,

2540
02:08:43,150 --> 02:08:48,150
who were creative.
We're still living at home with their 

2541
02:08:48,150 --> 02:08:49,510
parents.
And I think it's an added kick.

2542
02:08:49,540 --> 02:08:50,410
It's like,
you know,

2543
02:08:50,560 --> 02:08:55,560
when do you hit the nitrous oxide in 
order to get the car to zoom into 

2544
02:08:55,560 --> 02:08:55,690
hyperspace?
Uh,

2545
02:08:56,410 --> 02:08:57,280
I think,
you know,

2546
02:08:57,281 --> 02:08:58,660
I.
Before I ever met you,

2547
02:08:58,661 --> 02:09:01,210
I had this shtick about the world uncle 
shortage,

2548
02:09:01,450 --> 02:09:06,450
that fundamentally we needed a class of 
uncles and also aunts who aren't exactly

2549
02:09:07,061 --> 02:09:11,830
parents to put a cigar in your mouth in 
a single malt and in your hand and say,

2550
02:09:11,860 --> 02:09:14,130
listen kid,
this is how the world actually works.

2551
02:09:14,350 --> 02:09:16,450
Get the hell out there and master it.
Yeah,

2552
02:09:16,480 --> 02:09:17,050
don't,
don't,

2553
02:09:17,110 --> 02:09:19,340
don't you bucko me.
But the key issue is,

2554
02:09:19,341 --> 02:09:24,341
is that I think you became the one man 
answer to the world uncle shortage.

2555
02:09:25,330 --> 02:09:29,470
And I think it's important at some point
to deepen the offering because there are

2556
02:09:29,471 --> 02:09:31,600
many different kinds.
like fundamentally,

2557
02:09:31,601 --> 02:09:36,601
I need to not focus on cleaning my room.
I have because I'm a messy room guy and 

2558
02:09:36,601 --> 02:09:40,960
I need to get my physics out and I need 
to do certain sorts of things to get my 

2559
02:09:40,960 --> 02:09:42,730
life in order that are different.
They're not doing anything.

2560
02:09:42,880 --> 02:09:44,930
You could start by cleaning your room.
No,

2561
02:09:44,940 --> 02:09:45,160
no,
no.

2562
02:09:45,161 --> 02:09:46,540
I didn't.
It's not bad advice.

2563
02:09:46,660 --> 02:09:47,200
I know.
I know,

2564
02:09:47,201 --> 02:09:49,960
but it's also the case that we need 
sane,

2565
02:09:50,080 --> 02:09:55,080
tough,
funky ants because there's a lot of bad 

2566
02:09:55,080 --> 02:09:59,431
advice being given to women and oh well,
a lot of this radical stuff on the left 

2567
02:09:59,471 --> 02:10:02,350
isn't going to be sorted out by matt if 
it's going to be sorted out.

2568
02:10:02,350 --> 02:10:07,350
It's going to be sorted out by sensible 
women who put it into it and I'm hoping 

2569
02:10:07,350 --> 02:10:08,560
that will happen and just a sensible 
women that I,

2570
02:10:08,680 --> 02:10:11,410
that I've talked to who would like to do
that are terrified,

2571
02:10:11,411 --> 02:10:12,550
terrified,
shredded by.

2572
02:10:12,551 --> 02:10:13,810
I'm so glad you sent.
Oh,

2573
02:10:13,811 --> 02:10:15,970
absolutely.
I hear that over and over,

2574
02:10:16,240 --> 02:10:19,150
and these are often women who are in 
positions of substantial power.

2575
02:10:19,151 --> 02:10:22,200
You wouldn't think that they would be 
terrified of this,

2576
02:10:22,220 --> 02:10:22,900
but this,
this,

2577
02:10:22,920 --> 02:10:25,420
this,
this is what one of these women who will

2578
02:10:25,421 --> 02:10:27,160
remain nameless said to me,
she said,

2579
02:10:27,670 --> 02:10:31,360
I've never been afraid of men,
and I said,

2580
02:10:31,361 --> 02:10:32,410
well,
what are you afraid of?

2581
02:10:32,530 --> 02:10:34,100
And we worked through it a little bit 
and she said,

2582
02:10:34,100 --> 02:10:35,810
I guess what I'm afraid of is weak 
women.

2583
02:10:36,460 --> 02:10:38,570
Yes.
Yes.

2584
02:10:38,920 --> 02:10:41,720
What an interesting observation that 
fundamentally,

2585
02:10:42,280 --> 02:10:45,590
you know,
strong people can say that comment was a

2586
02:10:45,591 --> 02:10:46,530
little sour.
Yeah.

2587
02:10:46,540 --> 02:10:47,990
It doesn't have to be lIke,
oh yeah,

2588
02:10:48,320 --> 02:10:53,320
what did you say?
Because very often how many boneheaded 

2589
02:10:53,320 --> 02:10:55,060
comments I make boneheaded comments you 
make if you,

2590
02:10:55,061 --> 02:10:58,670
if people don't have a chance to play 
with ideas and to come back from it,

2591
02:10:58,940 --> 02:11:00,890
if the answer to everything is your 
cancel,

2592
02:11:01,580 --> 02:11:02,900
well then,
then there's no hope.

2593
02:11:02,930 --> 02:11:07,930
Well then you're not in.
You're also just not inviting people to 

2594
02:11:07,930 --> 02:11:10,331
play with the ideas that actually they 
can't play with them and never be stupid

2595
02:11:10,791 --> 02:11:13,130
in their initial formulations of the 
ideas.

2596
02:11:13,131 --> 02:11:16,550
Then they don't get it on the nose.
So on that note,

2597
02:11:16,551 --> 02:11:21,551
I want to take my two uncles out to 
lunch and then we will bring in my 

2598
02:11:21,621 --> 02:11:23,540
cousin ben shapiro.
How does that sound?

2599
02:11:23,541 --> 02:11:24,650
Sounds good.
Sound good?

2600
02:11:24,651 --> 02:11:29,651
All right guys.
So we're going to do the second live 

2601
02:11:29,651 --> 02:11:29,651
stream.
Uh,

2602
02:11:29,651 --> 02:11:29,651
this is gonna end in a second.
We're gonna.

2603
02:11:29,651 --> 02:11:30,920
Do the second live stream with ben at 
1:00

2604
02:11:30,921 --> 02:11:35,921
pacific.
and be nice in the comment section 

2605
02:11:35,921 --> 02:11:35,921
because that's what your uncle want.
Addie,

2606
02:11:35,921 --> 02:11:36,590
you guys.
all right,

2607
02:11:36,650 --> 02:11:37,400
we'll be back in a sec.
