00:00:05,140 --> 00:00:05,973
So last Friday,
the progressive website mother Jones 

2
00:00:08,321 --> 00:00:09,154
included me in an article about a quote 
new extremist media industry that is 

3
00:00:13,331 --> 00:00:16,390
further to the right than Breitbart in 
the piece.

4
00:00:16,391 --> 00:00:20,500
The author referred to me as quote far 
right sighting interviews I've done with

5
00:00:20,501 --> 00:00:23,610
Mike Cernovich,
Milo Yiannopoulos and lauren southern to

6
00:00:23,611 --> 00:00:27,070
backup his accusation.
He Cherry picked these guests to fit his

7
00:00:27,071 --> 00:00:27,904
narrative,
yet somehow miss the endless amount of 

8
00:00:29,411 --> 00:00:30,244
liberals I've had on the show and some 
of the progressive's I've hosted as 

9
00:00:33,371 --> 00:00:34,660
well,
including Margaret Cho,

10
00:00:34,661 --> 00:00:36,250
Hilary Rosen,
mark duplass,

11
00:00:36,430 --> 00:00:37,263
John Fugal sang and Michael Ian Black.
The article also attack Patrion the 

12
00:00:41,051 --> 00:00:41,884
crowd funding platform,
which myself and my team's livelihood 

13
00:00:44,681 --> 00:00:45,514
depends on for being tolerant of people 
with quote far right views such as mine 

14
00:00:50,620 --> 00:00:51,453
though of course,
nowhere did it include any of my 

15
00:00:53,201 --> 00:00:55,900
purported far right views.
Earlier in the week,

16
00:00:55,901 --> 00:00:59,620
Forbes called the Rubin report,
a conservative talk show,

17
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:02,800
but immediately retracted the statement 
when I contacted them.

18
00:01:03,010 --> 00:01:03,843
Ironically,
I've been saying for a while that 

19
00:01:04,901 --> 00:01:08,710
defending my liberal beliefs is becoming
a conservative position.

20
00:01:08,890 --> 00:01:12,550
Although I don't think being called a 
conservative is somehow a pejorative.

21
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:13,593
It clearly isn't a proper descriptor for
this show in which I posted people from 

22
00:01:17,021 --> 00:01:17,854
across the political divide for Mother 
Jones to accuse me of being an 

23
00:01:21,101 --> 00:01:21,934
extremist.
Further to the right of Breitbart is 

24
00:01:25,030 --> 00:01:29,440
obviously an inflammatory and 
demonstrably dishonest statement.

25
00:01:29,650 --> 00:01:30,483
I've been around many people over the 
last few years who've been unfairly 

26
00:01:33,011 --> 00:01:35,860
maligned and I'm all too familiar with 
how this goes,

27
00:01:35,861 --> 00:01:38,020
whether it's Sam Harris,
Jordan Peterson,

28
00:01:38,021 --> 00:01:39,370
Collin Moriarty,
I Ayaan,

29
00:01:39,371 --> 00:01:40,204
Hirsi Ali or Bret Weinstein.
Each attack is virtually never based on 

30
00:01:43,691 --> 00:01:44,524
what these people have said,
but is instead crafted out of Straw man 

31
00:01:47,681 --> 00:01:51,280
arguments with the words racist and 
bigot tossed around like Andy.

32
00:01:51,580 --> 00:01:52,413
Suddenly the onus is on the people who 
aren't racists or bigots to disprove 

33
00:01:57,101 --> 00:01:57,934
this accusation,
usually slung by a misguided celebrity 

34
00:02:00,610 --> 00:02:02,680
or a malicious newspaper or website.

35
00:02:03,010 --> 00:02:03,843
The move then is on the accused.
Should they spend the time and energy 

36
00:02:07,451 --> 00:02:10,690
defending themselves from accusations 
which aren't true,

37
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:11,673
only to bring more attention to the 
accusations themselves or should they 

38
00:02:14,921 --> 00:02:15,754
ignore them,
hoping that the false claims will go 

39
00:02:17,651 --> 00:02:18,484
away over time?
I think there are solid arguments to be 

40
00:02:20,681 --> 00:02:24,730
made for either tactic and it truly 
depends on the situation at hand and the

41
00:02:24,731 --> 00:02:27,340
person involved in this case involving 
me,

42
00:02:27,341 --> 00:02:28,174
I went on the attack,
I decided this case was to agregious to 

43
00:02:31,571 --> 00:02:35,920
ignore and I contacted the articles 
author via twitter,

44
00:02:36,010 --> 00:02:39,040
screenshotting pieces of his article and
asking him to defend them.

45
00:02:39,370 --> 00:02:41,470
Of course he couldn't defend his own 
words.

46
00:02:41,530 --> 00:02:42,363
That's the thing with truth.
It's hard to work around and eventually 

47
00:02:44,741 --> 00:02:45,574
he made slight changes to the article 
like including a tweet of mine in which 

48
00:02:48,971 --> 00:02:49,804
I defended myself from his claims and he
removed the word far in front of the 

49
00:02:54,311 --> 00:02:57,550
word right before referencing me in the 
article,

50
00:02:58,690 --> 00:03:01,450
putting the rest of the specifics of the
article itself,

51
00:03:01,451 --> 00:03:02,284
I was happy to get a strong defense in 
public for many friends all over the 

52
00:03:05,441 --> 00:03:06,274
political map.

53
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:08,710
People like Joe Rogan,
Collin Moriarity,

54
00:03:08,711 --> 00:03:09,880
Feisal site,
all Matar,

55
00:03:09,881 --> 00:03:11,620
Bret Weinstein,
Eric Weinstein,

56
00:03:11,621 --> 00:03:13,170
Michael Shermer,
Peter Posey,

57
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:14,093
and in many others offered strong 
defenses of me just as I've offered for 

58
00:03:17,141 --> 00:03:19,720
others when I've seen them unfairly 
attacked.

59
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:20,733
I even got a public defense from Donald 
Trump jr putting my friends in public 

60
00:03:25,060 --> 00:03:25,893
allies aside though it's incredibly 
inspiring and humbling to see literally 

61
00:03:29,711 --> 00:03:30,544
tens of thousands of people offer their 
voice when they feel you've been 

62
00:03:34,571 --> 00:03:37,990
unjustly attacked.
And that's the key to this whole thing.

63
00:03:37,991 --> 00:03:41,260
It's not me or Sam or Jordan or Brett 
that they fear.

64
00:03:41,261 --> 00:03:43,810
What they really fear is that all of 
you,

65
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:47,710
we'll start saying what you think 
because there's strength in numbers.

66
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:50,560
By Monday I wanted to put this whole 
story behind me.

67
00:03:50,561 --> 00:03:54,250
My dog had a health emergency,
which actually put this whole thing into

68
00:03:54,251 --> 00:03:55,450
perspective.
Uh,

69
00:03:55,451 --> 00:03:56,284
but I admit I did get sucked back into 
the story very briefly over the course 

70
00:03:59,741 --> 00:04:00,970
of another twitter exchange.

71
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:01,833
I got the writer of the piece,
Josh Harkinson to publicly admit that I 

72
00:04:05,801 --> 00:04:06,634
am not further right than Breitbart.
Though of course he didn't change the 

73
00:04:09,791 --> 00:04:13,000
title or have mother Jones issue any 
sort of public correction.

74
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:16,030
One other interesting piece to all this 
is that the writer,

75
00:04:16,031 --> 00:04:20,620
Josh Harkinson is one of the 40 people 
that James Hodgkinson,

76
00:04:20,621 --> 00:04:24,100
the shooter of the Republican Baseball 
team last week in Virginia,

77
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:26,080
followed on twitter.
Now,

78
00:04:26,081 --> 00:04:26,914
I can't draw a direct link there,
but we know that Hodgkinson was a far 

79
00:04:30,521 --> 00:04:34,360
left lefty who was obviously driven to 
political extremes,

80
00:04:34,690 --> 00:04:39,690
so when this very same writer does a 
hatchet job on me calling me further,

81
00:04:39,941 --> 00:04:43,330
right than Breitbart,
which is clearly a code for racist,

82
00:04:43,660 --> 00:04:47,620
I can't sit back there and take it.
This is exactly why I've been saying you

83
00:04:47,621 --> 00:04:48,454
can't punch Nazis call everyone.
You oppose a Nazi and a racist and then 

84
00:04:52,361 --> 00:04:56,380
eventually you will see violence as the 
next logical step.

85
00:04:56,590 --> 00:04:57,423
It's not a crazy exercise to think that 
this is partially what drove James 

86
00:05:01,750 --> 00:05:02,710
Hodgkinson.
In hindsight.

87
00:05:02,711 --> 00:05:03,544
His attack on me was the next obvious 
step in where this whole collectivist 

88
00:05:06,251 --> 00:05:08,800
movement is going.
I've talked for a long time about how if

89
00:05:08,801 --> 00:05:12,550
you can't debate ideas,
you use lies in buzzwords.

90
00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:14,980
Having a turned on me shouldn't have 
been a surprise,

91
00:05:14,981 --> 00:05:17,290
especially from a leftist site like 
mother Jones.

92
00:05:17,291 --> 00:05:20,620
Yet somehow it did still surprise me.
Make no mistake.

93
00:05:20,650 --> 00:05:21,483
There is a think acquisition going on 
here and it can come for anyone at any 

94
00:05:25,521 --> 00:05:26,354
time.
If you ally yourself with people who 

95
00:05:28,751 --> 00:05:29,584
value the movement,
in this case a political movement over 

96
00:05:32,291 --> 00:05:33,124
you as an individual,
then eventually it is inevitable that 

97
00:05:36,401 --> 00:05:39,280
they will come for you and if they don't
come for you,

98
00:05:39,281 --> 00:05:40,114
your probably the one coming for them.
This think was issued will come after 

99
00:05:43,511 --> 00:05:44,344
anyone who bucks the trend and the 
stereotypes and dares think for 

100
00:05:47,111 --> 00:05:47,944
themselves.

101
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:51,670
It's why they accused Ayaan Hirsi Ali of
being anti Muslim.

102
00:05:51,820 --> 00:05:54,730
It's why they slander Bill Maher as 
being a racist.

103
00:05:54,731 --> 00:05:55,564
It's why they call Larry elder and uncle
Tom and it's apparently they can brand 

104
00:05:58,791 --> 00:06:02,840
me a far right extremist.
Those who are a part of this thing,

105
00:06:02,841 --> 00:06:03,674
acquisition fear you thinking for 
yourself that you won't bow to their 

106
00:06:07,791 --> 00:06:10,460
collectivists demands more than anything
else.

107
00:06:10,790 --> 00:06:11,623
The way to beat this witch hunt is to be
yourself and fight for what you believe 

108
00:06:15,860 --> 00:06:18,530
you are the antidote that they fear 
most.

109
00:06:18,710 --> 00:06:19,543
I hope that next time you see me 
fighting back and getting some cover 

110
00:06:22,311 --> 00:06:23,144
from my allies,
it will inspire you to fight back 

111
00:06:25,610 --> 00:06:29,000
specifically with words,
not violence as well.

112
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:33,830
Joining me on the show this week is one 
of my afro mentioned allies and a friend

113
00:06:33,831 --> 00:06:36,770
and author and professor Peter 
Boghossian,

114
00:06:36,980 --> 00:06:41,030
who's going to help me dissect some of 
the madness of 2017 and much more.

115
00:06:46,190 --> 00:06:47,023
Joining me today is an author and a 
professor of philosophy at Portland 

116
00:06:50,990 --> 00:06:54,730
State University and a man who strives 
to be a good human every day.

117
00:06:54,860 --> 00:06:56,630
Peter [inaudible],
welcome back.

118
00:06:56,660 --> 00:06:59,270
It's great to be here.
Thanks and thanks for the striving to be

119
00:06:59,271 --> 00:07:00,104
a good human.
You'd never know it from what people 

120
00:07:01,971 --> 00:07:05,300
have been saying about us.
Well certainly about me,

121
00:07:05,370 --> 00:07:06,203
about you.
You really been through the ringer in 

122
00:07:07,641 --> 00:07:10,670
the last few days and I would love to 
get to that and talk about that.

123
00:07:10,671 --> 00:07:14,150
I suspect we can get to that,
but strives to be a good human being.

124
00:07:14,151 --> 00:07:18,630
The reason I threw that in there,
because that seems to me you were on the

125
00:07:18,631 --> 00:07:22,250
show about a year and a half ago.
We had never met before that we've since

126
00:07:22,251 --> 00:07:24,400
become very good for her in front of me.
Hit A,

127
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:25,273
we hit it off instantly just like that 
and when you were on the show and we'll 

128
00:07:27,651 --> 00:07:30,410
link to it down below so that people can
see the initial sit down.

129
00:07:30,770 --> 00:07:31,603
Um,
I felt that it was one of the episodes 

130
00:07:33,771 --> 00:07:36,590
where so many of the things that I had 
been thinking about,

131
00:07:37,070 --> 00:07:39,170
about the left,
about politics,

132
00:07:39,171 --> 00:07:43,020
about religion and so many of the things
sort of all came to get whole.

133
00:07:43,060 --> 00:07:46,190
I actually,
they really did and I felt I felt richer

134
00:07:46,191 --> 00:07:47,900
after.
And I do often in some interviews,

135
00:07:47,901 --> 00:07:48,734
some interviews I feel dumber,
but this was one way I felt richer and 

136
00:07:51,291 --> 00:07:56,030
since we've become friends,
but you do strive to be a pretty decent,

137
00:07:56,180 --> 00:07:56,960
I do.
As you know,

138
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:57,793
you said,
how should I introduce you in the 

139
00:07:58,431 --> 00:08:00,740
beginning?
And I was thinking don't ask that.

140
00:08:00,741 --> 00:08:01,574
Normally the only reason I asked is 
because we're friends and I thought 

141
00:08:03,650 --> 00:08:04,483
maybe there's some person,
a little anecdote or something that you 

142
00:08:06,111 --> 00:08:06,944
want to,
and I really,

143
00:08:07,610 --> 00:08:10,430
I really just striving to be a good 
person.

144
00:08:10,460 --> 00:08:13,520
I think that that's one of the things 
that matter is that kindness,

145
00:08:13,521 --> 00:08:14,270
that compassion.

146
00:08:14,270 --> 00:08:19,270
I think we've so lost it and acrimonious
and we're so hyper partisan where so and

147
00:08:19,401 --> 00:08:20,234
the college craziness and everything 
that's been going on and they at the 

148
00:08:23,811 --> 00:08:24,644
attacks and the people will give you an 
opportunity to respond to those attacks 

149
00:08:28,071 --> 00:08:31,700
and the negativity on social media.
So yeah,

150
00:08:31,701 --> 00:08:35,120
I'm just trying to be a good guy and was
trying to live a good life,

151
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:38,990
a good life.
So in the last couple of months you lost

152
00:08:38,991 --> 00:08:40,130
your dad.
I did.

153
00:08:40,131 --> 00:08:43,130
That was the seminal event of one of the
seminal events in my life.

154
00:08:43,610 --> 00:08:46,790
How do you stay a good person throughout
that?

155
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:47,953
Not that,
not that losing someone's going to make 

156
00:08:48,771 --> 00:08:52,490
you a bad person obviously,
but you're still trying to work.

157
00:08:52,491 --> 00:08:56,250
You're still trying to be a public 
person and to and like how do you manage

158
00:08:56,250 --> 00:08:57,083
not just going nutty.
And in the course of that I had some 

159
00:08:58,651 --> 00:08:59,484
health issues.
I was in the emergency room three times 

160
00:09:01,561 --> 00:09:03,660
the last few months I have Crohn's 
disease.

161
00:09:03,661 --> 00:09:06,120
So that that's not doing me any favors 
either.

162
00:09:06,180 --> 00:09:07,080
Without getting too deep.
I mean,

163
00:09:07,081 --> 00:09:08,970
you were in the hospital today.
Yeah,

164
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:11,150
yeah.
If you want me to tell it to people,

165
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:13,473
stuff going on.
But I think open about it and I think 

166
00:09:15,241 --> 00:09:16,074
that that,
that really does make every moment of 

167
00:09:17,971 --> 00:09:19,530
your life precious.
And when my,

168
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:23,850
my dad died and my mom died,
um,

169
00:09:24,420 --> 00:09:25,253
I dunno,
it's a kind of a combination of feeling 

170
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:31,600
more circumspect.
And I,

171
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:33,750
and I've always had in the back of my 
mind,

172
00:09:33,780 --> 00:09:36,570
my parents have probation or what my dad
think or my mom thing.

173
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:40,080
And it's kind of really given me an 
opportunity to,

174
00:09:40,081 --> 00:09:40,914
I'm trying to frame it positively,
it trying to given me me an opportunity 

175
00:09:44,701 --> 00:09:49,320
to reflect on what they did for me in my
life and try to do that for my kids.

176
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:51,840
But yeah,
when living navigating that reality,

177
00:09:51,841 --> 00:09:54,150
when your parents have died,
it's very intense.

178
00:09:54,151 --> 00:09:55,950
It's very,
you know,

179
00:09:56,010 --> 00:09:57,610
even little things like you get in the 
car,

180
00:09:57,611 --> 00:09:58,444
he shot,
he's getting the car and she'd call my 

181
00:09:58,831 --> 00:10:01,170
dad or I call my mom and I don't do that
anymore.

182
00:10:01,171 --> 00:10:04,680
And I think one of the,
that's why I was thinking today,

183
00:10:04,681 --> 00:10:07,260
I don't like the idea that someone 
passed it.

184
00:10:08,510 --> 00:10:09,720
They,
they're debt,

185
00:10:09,750 --> 00:10:10,583
they've died.
There's a permanence to that and that 

186
00:10:12,571 --> 00:10:15,180
language.
And I am always taking to myself like,

187
00:10:15,181 --> 00:10:17,400
oh my mom would like that,
my dad like that.

188
00:10:17,401 --> 00:10:20,070
And the real quick one,
my,

189
00:10:20,340 --> 00:10:22,030
my mom died.
Uh,

190
00:10:22,770 --> 00:10:26,700
it wasn't really into her funeral that I
understood that she died,

191
00:10:26,701 --> 00:10:30,570
like really grokked it because someone 
fell asleep and her funeral.

192
00:10:31,170 --> 00:10:31,981
And I thought,
God,

193
00:10:31,981 --> 00:10:34,830
my mom would think that's hilarious.
She would love that.

194
00:10:35,190 --> 00:10:36,023
And then I realized like I could never 
tell her that I could never tell her 

195
00:10:39,211 --> 00:10:40,200
anything again.

196
00:10:40,770 --> 00:10:41,603
And those pillars in your life that you 
can't go to in times of joy in times of 

197
00:10:46,351 --> 00:10:46,951
stress,
you know,

198
00:10:46,951 --> 00:10:48,900
it was in the hospital for another time 
for my Crohn's disease.

199
00:10:49,110 --> 00:10:51,480
My Dad stayed up with me all night.
He was there.

200
00:10:51,780 --> 00:10:54,690
And that part of my life is gone now.
Yeah.

201
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:59,720
So as a philosophy professor and as a 
well known and outspoken atheist,

202
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:01,193
when,
when you're challenged with something 

203
00:11:02,131 --> 00:11:06,000
like the death of a parent,
did any of your beliefs get challenged?

204
00:11:06,001 --> 00:11:06,834
I mean,
is there a moment at right after your 

205
00:11:08,941 --> 00:11:11,040
dad passed where you thought,
man,

206
00:11:11,041 --> 00:11:11,874
I want to believe,
or did you maybe have a dream that 

207
00:11:14,281 --> 00:11:15,690
seemed different?
You know,

208
00:11:15,990 --> 00:11:19,090
something like that because you know,
you know my feelings on roof and I,

209
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:20,820
and I'm not a believer in the 
traditional sense,

210
00:11:20,821 --> 00:11:23,700
and yet occasionally things happen that 
I go,

211
00:11:23,890 --> 00:11:26,070
what was that after my,
my grandma passed too.

212
00:11:26,070 --> 00:11:27,280
I was very close with,
I'm sorry,

213
00:11:27,281 --> 00:11:30,300
I had some very vivid dreams that seem 
to me,

214
00:11:30,301 --> 00:11:31,530
she was telling me something.
No,

215
00:11:31,531 --> 00:11:34,020
I'm not,
I'm not saying I buy it for all of this,

216
00:11:34,021 --> 00:11:38,020
but it has some value to me.
Did you have any of that or no?

217
00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:38,671
Have any of that?
No.

218
00:11:38,671 --> 00:11:39,504
No.
I was just incredibly bereaved and I 

219
00:11:42,631 --> 00:11:44,360
was,
uh,

220
00:11:44,420 --> 00:11:47,940
it mean it was just a shattering of a 
type of reality for me.

221
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:49,073
And,
but it also made me realize that it 

222
00:11:50,311 --> 00:11:53,010
really is true,
that every moment of life is precious.

223
00:11:53,110 --> 00:11:57,520
Just have to be so grateful.
Go through life with a sort of gratitude

224
00:11:57,521 --> 00:11:58,354
for the experiences that you have.
So when you hear someone like me that 

225
00:12:01,121 --> 00:12:02,290
you know pretty well say,
well,

226
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:03,750
you know,
my grandma passed away and then,

227
00:12:03,820 --> 00:12:05,810
I mean I can tell you about the dream.
I was in her apartment,

228
00:12:06,340 --> 00:12:09,010
she looked amazing,
she was like glowing and she was wearing

229
00:12:09,011 --> 00:12:09,844
all black and she had these like green 
neon streaks in her hair and she was 

230
00:12:12,281 --> 00:12:13,690
like running in place really fast.

231
00:12:13,810 --> 00:12:16,360
And she was telling me how excited she 
is and she has all these things to do.

232
00:12:16,361 --> 00:12:17,194
I mean it was,
and it was vivid and powerful and 

233
00:12:19,060 --> 00:12:19,893
whatever.
And so when you hear me say something 

234
00:12:21,371 --> 00:12:24,540
like that as,
as a nonbeliever w,

235
00:12:24,690 --> 00:12:25,523
what do you think of that?
I think it's totally normal and totally 

236
00:12:28,121 --> 00:12:28,954
natural.
I think different people grieve in 

237
00:12:29,861 --> 00:12:30,694
different ways.
And I think it was when my grandfather 

238
00:12:33,761 --> 00:12:35,080
died,
I had a similar experience.

239
00:12:35,081 --> 00:12:35,681
I,
I,

240
00:12:35,681 --> 00:12:38,350
uh,
have a hyper vivid dream about him.

241
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:40,660
I think these moments in life,
life,

242
00:12:40,661 --> 00:12:42,190
death,
they're really,

243
00:12:42,700 --> 00:12:45,160
they give you a kind of clarity 
sometimes,

244
00:12:45,161 --> 00:12:46,630
but they also get,
so here's,

245
00:12:46,810 --> 00:12:47,920
so for my dad,
when,

246
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:49,353
when he died and I was holding my dad's 
hand and his death and my mom seeing 

247
00:12:52,711 --> 00:12:53,261
her,
her death.

248
00:12:53,261 --> 00:12:55,300
So I was incredibly fortunate,
you know,

249
00:12:55,301 --> 00:12:59,080
they saw me into the world and I saw 
them out of the world.

250
00:12:59,770 --> 00:13:02,650
I was just irreconcilable.
I mean I was just so,

251
00:13:02,651 --> 00:13:03,880
I was a complete mess.
I was.

252
00:13:04,150 --> 00:13:07,840
And the woman who comes in and the 
social worker would have,

253
00:13:07,841 --> 00:13:08,321
you said,
you know,

254
00:13:08,321 --> 00:13:13,210
normally we have grief counselors here 
and normally I would suggest to say,

255
00:13:13,211 --> 00:13:17,050
but in your case I really think you have
to go see the grief counselor.

256
00:13:17,051 --> 00:13:22,051
Like I'm sending supersede the grief 
counselor in there is.

257
00:13:22,750 --> 00:13:23,583
And I think part of that was so hard for
me is precisely because they don't have 

258
00:13:26,891 --> 00:13:29,170
those metaphysical beliefs.
Like it's the finality.

259
00:13:29,171 --> 00:13:31,020
Like that's it.
So we'll see.

260
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:33,100
So then did you have moments through 
these?

261
00:13:33,190 --> 00:13:34,023
So you didn't,
I guess you're saying you really didn't 

262
00:13:35,081 --> 00:13:37,720
have a moment where suddenly you've got,
maybe I got this wrong or,

263
00:13:37,870 --> 00:13:41,170
or I want to believe in something that I
can't prove,

264
00:13:41,171 --> 00:13:45,070
but [inaudible] really it's really that 
locked for you.

265
00:13:45,070 --> 00:13:45,970
Like,
oh no,

266
00:13:45,971 --> 00:13:46,804
it's not locked.
I just never bartered my hope for 

267
00:13:48,491 --> 00:13:49,211
anything.
You know,

268
00:13:49,211 --> 00:13:51,310
I never,
I never as a great line.

269
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:53,720
Oh yeah.
Everybody was my hope for anything.

270
00:13:53,860 --> 00:13:55,450
That's true though.
I mean I never,

271
00:13:56,680 --> 00:13:58,700
and then the,
you go through the long run.

272
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:00,100
I was living in his house.
I was driving,

273
00:14:00,101 --> 00:14:00,934
his cars weren't as close because right 
after we did the event with Christina 

274
00:14:03,700 --> 00:14:04,820
Hoff Summers,
the next day that I went,

275
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:06,480
I went out there to see him.
But yeah,

276
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:09,100
it was fortunate.
And you know,

277
00:14:09,101 --> 00:14:11,520
one thing that people really don't want 
to talk about,

278
00:14:11,530 --> 00:14:14,110
I think the left and the right has their
own blind spots.

279
00:14:14,140 --> 00:14:14,973
But parenting,
I am absolutely convinced is a 

280
00:14:20,051 --> 00:14:22,390
prophylactic to bad behavior,
good parenting.

281
00:14:22,900 --> 00:14:23,733
And if you look at the data,
kids are more likely to commit violent 

282
00:14:26,501 --> 00:14:28,540
crimes if they're in a certain age 
group.

283
00:14:29,230 --> 00:14:30,063
I just read this and I was reading Math 
Thorton's manuscript above violence and 

284
00:14:34,031 --> 00:14:34,864
if there are males and if there's no 
adult male president of the home and 

285
00:14:38,140 --> 00:14:40,840
just as the left doesn't want to 
acknowledge that and talk about that.

286
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:44,740
So too does the right have particular 
blinders about structural inequality and

287
00:14:44,741 --> 00:14:47,200
such.
But I think parenting and good parenting

288
00:14:47,201 --> 00:14:49,090
and being thoughtful and what that 
means.

289
00:14:49,091 --> 00:14:50,920
When I was the,
when I was driving down here,

290
00:14:50,921 --> 00:14:52,910
the Uber driver told me that,
um,

291
00:14:53,420 --> 00:14:57,350
I'm not going to mention what country 
she was from and I'm looking at 50,000

292
00:14:57,351 --> 00:14:59,240
emails,
these people and,

293
00:14:59,241 --> 00:14:59,750
and no,
no.

294
00:14:59,750 --> 00:15:02,030
Can you pick a,
give me the same hemisphere.

295
00:15:02,031 --> 00:15:03,180
Southeast Asia.
Okay,

296
00:15:03,181 --> 00:15:04,014
fair.
It was telling me that they come from a 

297
00:15:05,751 --> 00:15:09,230
traditional family and I asked,
why doesn't your,

298
00:15:09,560 --> 00:15:12,590
why don't your kids go to see your ex?
And she said,

299
00:15:12,591 --> 00:15:13,760
well,
he used to spank them.

300
00:15:14,770 --> 00:15:15,603
And I thought like,
wow,

301
00:15:15,650 --> 00:15:18,470
I've never raised my hand to my children
ever.

302
00:15:18,830 --> 00:15:22,610
I have raised my voice on occasion.
I've never lost my temper.

303
00:15:23,150 --> 00:15:26,840
It doesn't speak to me.
I think Denmark smacked me once or twice

304
00:15:26,841 --> 00:15:27,380
in an argument.

305
00:15:27,380 --> 00:15:29,840
And more than that.
But that's the other thing.

306
00:15:29,841 --> 00:15:34,280
It's this idea about verbal violence.
It's the idea.

307
00:15:34,460 --> 00:15:36,230
It's a complicated,
but I think parenting,

308
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:38,540
I think we've overlooked how important 
that is.

309
00:15:38,660 --> 00:15:39,291
Oh,
one more thing.

310
00:15:39,291 --> 00:15:40,124
One thing,
since we're talking about this and 

311
00:15:40,821 --> 00:15:43,010
planning on talking about this,
they have no plan here.

312
00:15:43,310 --> 00:15:45,110
The nurse said something really 
interesting to me.

313
00:15:45,111 --> 00:15:45,944
She said,
I bet you he was a wonderful father to 

314
00:15:48,861 --> 00:15:50,090
you.
And I said,

315
00:15:50,091 --> 00:15:51,680
well,
you say that to everybody.

316
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:52,461
And she said,
actually,

317
00:15:52,461 --> 00:15:53,294
no,
I don't.

318
00:15:53,420 --> 00:15:54,253
I,
I can tell by the way the kids treat 

319
00:15:55,971 --> 00:16:00,000
their parents when they come to the 
hospital and this,

320
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:02,750
it was so sad.
So I would walk into this hospital every

321
00:16:02,751 --> 00:16:07,250
day and I would see all these people who
were literally dying and they were alone

322
00:16:07,820 --> 00:16:08,653
and they had nobody.
And it just made me what kind of a 

323
00:16:13,101 --> 00:16:14,510
loneliness,
you know?

324
00:16:14,650 --> 00:16:15,483
Yeah.
Is that the funny thing about not 

325
00:16:17,171 --> 00:16:22,171
unbelief that you've so obviously had a 
transcendent experience,

326
00:16:23,050 --> 00:16:26,140
but it's all based in actually what 
happened.

327
00:16:26,410 --> 00:16:27,550
So a lot of times,
I don't know,

328
00:16:27,690 --> 00:16:30,310
like I had a father,
he was a physical person.

329
00:16:30,311 --> 00:16:32,110
He lived in my home,
he raised me.

330
00:16:32,260 --> 00:16:32,981
Oh,
and this a thing.

331
00:16:32,981 --> 00:16:33,850
So I,
I,

332
00:16:34,510 --> 00:16:38,410
so what did I do when my father died 
after you know,

333
00:16:38,530 --> 00:16:39,363
sobbing.
And the first person I called was my 

334
00:16:40,950 --> 00:16:41,783
childhood friend.
Like the next person who had known me 

335
00:16:44,351 --> 00:16:48,400
for the longest time and he cheered me 
up and it was good.

336
00:16:48,460 --> 00:16:50,110
Or he tried to,
you know,

337
00:16:50,780 --> 00:16:52,850
that's connected to the family thing.
Don't you think?

338
00:16:52,851 --> 00:16:57,851
I've mentioned this a couple of times 
lately that I think now at 41 next week,

339
00:16:58,300 --> 00:17:00,350
I just started to really understand,
thanks.

340
00:17:00,351 --> 00:17:01,184
I've started to understand why the 
family thing is so important and that 

341
00:17:04,791 --> 00:17:05,624
I'm so proud that my parents had been 
married for 40 some odd years and I 

342
00:17:08,121 --> 00:17:08,954
still go home to the same childhood home
and my family friends are all still 

343
00:17:11,901 --> 00:17:12,630
there.
My,

344
00:17:12,630 --> 00:17:15,980
my best friend in the world is still the
same guy that I met before kindergarten.

345
00:17:15,981 --> 00:17:20,120
We were worried that those connections 
have incredible value.

346
00:17:21,140 --> 00:17:22,520
That's what the,
you know,

347
00:17:22,521 --> 00:17:23,660
what is the meaning of life?
Well,

348
00:17:23,661 --> 00:17:24,231
you know,
whatever,

349
00:17:24,231 --> 00:17:27,230
you make the meaning life b.
But Aristotle talks about that.

350
00:17:27,231 --> 00:17:28,064
And here's what I would throw out to you
and to the audiences that you can have 

351
00:17:32,331 --> 00:17:34,220
the richest,
deepest,

352
00:17:34,221 --> 00:17:35,054
most rewarding friendships if you are a 
person of virtue and the person with 

353
00:17:39,621 --> 00:17:41,420
whom you're friends with is a person of 
virtue.

354
00:17:41,421 --> 00:17:42,254
Aristotle says it's the highest form of 
friendship between two virtuous people 

355
00:17:45,320 --> 00:17:46,153
and what does that entail?
And it really does until it kind of 

356
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:52,230
Greek cop parrishcea speaking truth in 
the face of danger.

357
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:53,333
So,
and I've told you a few things and 

358
00:17:54,151 --> 00:17:55,320
you've told me a few things,
hey,

359
00:17:55,321 --> 00:17:57,120
I think you're wrong about this or have 
you.

360
00:17:57,600 --> 00:18:02,600
And if that is sufficient to decide that
we're going to part ways,

361
00:18:02,641 --> 00:18:05,310
then either our friendship wasn't that 
strong and the first place.

362
00:18:05,430 --> 00:18:06,263
Or I would like to think that we have 
the sort of relationship that we can be 

363
00:18:10,561 --> 00:18:11,394
completely honest with each other.
And even really I wouldn't spare your 

364
00:18:13,891 --> 00:18:14,724
feelings about something frankly,
which is what you and I exactly what 

365
00:18:17,491 --> 00:18:18,324
true French.
And then I would expect that you would 

366
00:18:20,131 --> 00:18:20,964
expect that.
I wouldn't spare your feelings and I 

367
00:18:21,901 --> 00:18:22,980
would just say,
hey look man,

368
00:18:23,220 --> 00:18:25,590
this is how it is.
You did this and I have to say,

369
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:29,430
and then whatever it was I was telling 
you about this right before we started.

370
00:18:29,431 --> 00:18:30,264
So without even saying this,
the sex or name of the person certainly 

371
00:18:32,371 --> 00:18:34,670
or anything like that.
I got into a bit of a,

372
00:18:34,671 --> 00:18:35,504
an argument with a friend of mine,
a public person just yesterday and we 

373
00:18:39,301 --> 00:18:40,134
really got into it on the phone and I 
made it clear and I've done this a 

374
00:18:44,191 --> 00:18:45,024
couple times lately,
made it clear with people that even if 

375
00:18:46,771 --> 00:18:50,700
we're apoplectically angry at each 
other,

376
00:18:50,830 --> 00:18:53,640
this is not going to end the friendship,
at least for me.

377
00:18:53,670 --> 00:18:55,800
Awesome.
And I feel very,

378
00:18:56,040 --> 00:18:58,480
that comes very easy for me to say that 
I,

379
00:18:58,620 --> 00:18:59,453
it really does.
And I don't know why that's so hard for 

380
00:19:02,161 --> 00:19:02,994
other people to do that.
We're so now willing and maybe it is a 

381
00:19:04,591 --> 00:19:05,424
social media thing in a short attention 
span thing or something like we're so 

382
00:19:08,521 --> 00:19:09,354
willing to just shred things that we've 
had yet lends itself to a really 

383
00:19:12,961 --> 00:19:15,540
interesting question.
What would be,

384
00:19:15,930 --> 00:19:17,760
since we're talking personally,
if I may,

385
00:19:18,180 --> 00:19:20,430
what would be a deal breaker for 
relationship?

386
00:19:20,460 --> 00:19:25,460
And I was at dinner with my family a few
weeks ago and my son,

387
00:19:26,041 --> 00:19:27,170
you've met my son.
Yeah,

388
00:19:27,230 --> 00:19:29,970
I junior kid almost always keep my 
family's names.

389
00:19:29,971 --> 00:19:30,804
And so far it started talking about one 
of the things you've learning about in 

390
00:19:33,571 --> 00:19:37,620
school is gender and social constructs 
and sex changes.

391
00:19:37,621 --> 00:19:41,940
And he said to my wife,
if dad decided to become a woman,

392
00:19:42,190 --> 00:19:43,950
would you still be married to him?

393
00:19:44,460 --> 00:19:47,430
And my wife without an instance of 
hesitation said no.

394
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:52,170
And both my children were flabbergasted,
but they couldn't.

395
00:19:52,230 --> 00:19:53,063
They couldn't.
And then they kept pressing her and she 

396
00:19:54,061 --> 00:19:54,871
said basically,
you know,

397
00:19:54,871 --> 00:19:59,100
this isn't what I signed up for and,
and it just made me think.

398
00:19:59,310 --> 00:20:00,143
So what are the limits of friendship?
Like what would the limits of 

399
00:20:02,731 --> 00:20:05,370
friendship,
I mean I can think of a few things.

400
00:20:05,940 --> 00:20:06,773
Well if you,
if I found out that you murdered 

401
00:20:08,101 --> 00:20:08,934
somebody,
you're a cold blooded murderer or you 

402
00:20:10,531 --> 00:20:14,270
had done something so duplicitous 
directly related to me too,

403
00:20:14,430 --> 00:20:16,620
or even even I would have made me even 
to someone else.

404
00:20:16,621 --> 00:20:17,900
Or I'm in Korea.
Yeah,

405
00:20:17,930 --> 00:20:19,860
it doesn't have it.
We couldn't make a scale like,

406
00:20:19,861 --> 00:20:20,694
but what if I started filling my pockets
when you're in the kitchen with grapes 

407
00:20:22,741 --> 00:20:24,390
and that I saw in the fray.
Great.

408
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:25,233
See,
I told you you could have anything out 

409
00:20:25,531 --> 00:20:25,650
of it.

410
00:20:25,650 --> 00:20:26,500
I know,
I know right now.

411
00:20:26,910 --> 00:20:28,190
The funny thing is we'd have a 
relationship.

412
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:28,840
I didn't ask.
I was,

413
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:30,940
I take it anyway,
so,

414
00:20:30,941 --> 00:20:33,600
so like what if I went into your bedroom
when you were gone and went through your

415
00:20:33,601 --> 00:20:35,040
drugs like there,
there are,

416
00:20:35,730 --> 00:20:39,470
there are.
You know what those limits are,

417
00:20:39,471 --> 00:20:40,560
are different.
But I would,

418
00:20:40,650 --> 00:20:41,483
I suggest that it really comes down to 
virtue and trust and those sorts of 

419
00:20:46,780 --> 00:20:50,410
relationships give your life so much 
meaning and are so fulfilling and are so

420
00:20:50,411 --> 00:20:53,200
profound.
They make for a life worth living.

421
00:20:54,370 --> 00:20:55,203
And Nat,
I think what we need to put front and 

422
00:20:57,041 --> 00:21:00,910
center in our lives and even that stuff 
on addiction is fascinating.

423
00:21:01,270 --> 00:21:03,250
Um,
rice addiction medicine doctor.

424
00:21:03,251 --> 00:21:08,251
And she gave this really interesting 
presentation about how one of the,

425
00:21:08,470 --> 00:21:13,470
the reasons that people become and stay 
addicts and all the studies,

426
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:15,850
and this is the art of my area of 
expertise,

427
00:21:15,851 --> 00:21:16,684
but basically these does these studies 
on rad parks and when rats are given 

428
00:21:21,550 --> 00:21:25,210
wheels and fun thing or habit trails 
wherever wraps,

429
00:21:25,211 --> 00:21:29,560
like they're much less likely to choose 
narcotics then if they're not.

430
00:21:30,490 --> 00:21:31,323
And one of those things is these 
relationships that we develop and we 

431
00:21:33,911 --> 00:21:34,744
nurture throughout our lives.
And I guess I would like to be the sort 

432
00:21:37,931 --> 00:21:38,764
of person for whom being a person of 
integrity and virtue and having those 

433
00:21:44,651 --> 00:21:49,651
deeply fulfilling relationships enhances
my life and my friendship.

434
00:21:49,750 --> 00:21:52,180
And then when you call me and you say,
hey,

435
00:21:52,210 --> 00:21:53,860
this is up.
Thanks for that,

436
00:21:53,890 --> 00:21:57,010
I appreciate you did this.
And that was as a massive dick move.

437
00:21:57,430 --> 00:21:58,510
Thanks.
I appreciate that.

438
00:21:58,660 --> 00:21:59,493
So I know we've talked about,
we've definitely talked about this 

439
00:22:00,881 --> 00:22:01,714
privately,
but I think we may have talked about it 

440
00:22:02,470 --> 00:22:03,303
last time also,
but I think it'd be good to recharge if 

441
00:22:04,511 --> 00:22:05,344
someone does exactly what you just said,
find that virtuous life but needs to do 

442
00:22:10,301 --> 00:22:13,330
it through belief but does the exact 
same thing.

443
00:22:13,660 --> 00:22:16,960
Do you think that that is somehow still 
an inherent problem with,

444
00:22:17,410 --> 00:22:21,160
with the proper,
not the proper way to be a human,

445
00:22:21,161 --> 00:22:23,980
but just well,
what's the problem then if somebody does

446
00:22:23,981 --> 00:22:24,520
that?

447
00:22:24,520 --> 00:22:25,370
Uh,
well there,

448
00:22:25,371 --> 00:22:30,250
there are two to two issues with that.
One is what's the problem?

449
00:22:30,310 --> 00:22:33,100
Does that cause a problem with your 
relationship to somebody?

450
00:22:33,550 --> 00:22:38,550
So I have a friend who's,
not only is he a hardcore Christian,

451
00:22:38,861 --> 00:22:42,890
he writes children's books trying to 
indoctrinate people into Christian.

452
00:22:42,891 --> 00:22:44,020
Phil Vischer,
the guy from veggies,

453
00:22:44,070 --> 00:22:45,820
Veggie Tales,
just be on very good friend of mine,

454
00:22:45,940 --> 00:22:46,773
Alex and such.
So this shows you can be friends with 

455
00:22:49,151 --> 00:22:49,984
some you can and,
and I've confided in her about things 

456
00:22:52,211 --> 00:22:56,830
and I trust him and I have told him in 
no uncertain terms,

457
00:22:56,831 --> 00:22:59,630
I think he's harboring a,
not a misconception,

458
00:22:59,650 --> 00:23:01,720
but delusion about the nature of 
reality.

459
00:23:02,020 --> 00:23:05,710
And we've had a civil talk,
no one threw fisticuffs Nolan.

460
00:23:06,280 --> 00:23:09,160
We talk about that in the context of our
friendship,

461
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:13,410
but that wasn't sufficient for him to 
end the Pie.

462
00:23:13,430 --> 00:23:14,263
Never had any idea where we were talking
about the side that wasn't sufficient 

463
00:23:17,021 --> 00:23:20,920
for him to withdraw from the friendship 
and the friendship.

464
00:23:21,340 --> 00:23:22,173
And that's a core belief.
I mean that's an antithetical belief to 

465
00:23:24,810 --> 00:23:25,643
what I've devoted my professional life 
is to helping people think clearly and 

466
00:23:29,531 --> 00:23:30,364
critically and overthrow Dogma and an 
ideology and morally motivated 

467
00:23:33,281 --> 00:23:35,320
reasoning.
But I think the problem,

468
00:23:35,770 --> 00:23:40,540
the problem with that is it depends on 
what you want to have,

469
00:23:40,541 --> 00:23:42,280
what your relationship to truth wants 
to,

470
00:23:42,970 --> 00:23:46,700
what you think it should be.
There would be something to me if,

471
00:23:46,730 --> 00:23:51,320
if somebody was friends with me and a 
genuine friend in a virtuous friend,

472
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:54,260
only because they feared that if they 
would not do that,

473
00:23:54,261 --> 00:23:57,740
they would go to hell.
There would be something suspect in that

474
00:23:57,741 --> 00:23:59,870
for me.
But what or who wasn't that?

475
00:23:59,871 --> 00:24:02,210
What if they just,
they just had some belief that,

476
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:04,280
you know what I mean?
Like whatever it is.

477
00:24:04,281 --> 00:24:08,090
Or they just had some belief that Karma 
prove our car.

478
00:24:08,120 --> 00:24:08,330
Right.

479
00:24:08,330 --> 00:24:09,141
Okay.
Karma is a great,

480
00:24:09,141 --> 00:24:10,520
yeah.
So they just believed in Karma.

481
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:11,953
What they're going to put out there is 
going to come back to them because of 

482
00:24:14,091 --> 00:24:18,410
that they become the virtuous type of 
person that you aspire to be.

483
00:24:18,440 --> 00:24:19,170
But it's a,
it's a,

484
00:24:19,170 --> 00:24:20,003
it's a great question.
I think I've shifted my stance on that 

485
00:24:22,100 --> 00:24:22,933
over the years,
but I guess I'm having trouble with the 

486
00:24:25,911 --> 00:24:26,744
question because I don't really think 
someone can truly be virtuous if they 

487
00:24:31,971 --> 00:24:35,720
harbor beliefs based on a faulty 
epistemology.

488
00:24:35,750 --> 00:24:37,310
Right.
So we could sort of get lost,

489
00:24:37,610 --> 00:24:40,760
but my definition of virtue then,
let's just say that's the case.

490
00:24:40,980 --> 00:24:41,813
Uh,
would the world would be better off in 

491
00:24:43,461 --> 00:24:44,294
human flourishing,
would be contributed to if more people 

492
00:24:46,281 --> 00:24:51,281
had this false belief of view than if we
resorted to this hub Sian state?

493
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:55,130
Um,
yeah.

494
00:24:55,131 --> 00:24:56,930
I,
I guess the problem would be,

495
00:24:56,970 --> 00:24:57,803
uh,
if they alone believe that and didn't 

496
00:24:59,241 --> 00:25:01,700
try to institutionalize that,
I think it would be,

497
00:25:01,730 --> 00:25:02,563
it would be less of a problem than I 
would have said even two or three years 

498
00:25:06,441 --> 00:25:06,920
ago.

499
00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:08,660
Yeah.
And I think perhaps,

500
00:25:08,690 --> 00:25:09,523
and I'll watch the video again myself,
I think you might've answered that a 

501
00:25:11,781 --> 00:25:14,000
little bit differently and I'm,
which shows a flexible mind.

502
00:25:14,180 --> 00:25:16,130
Do you ever fear that as,
as a public person,

503
00:25:16,310 --> 00:25:17,360
you say things,
you tweet,

504
00:25:17,361 --> 00:25:18,350
things you do,
interviews,

505
00:25:18,351 --> 00:25:19,184
you go on podcasts,
all those things that people are gonna 

506
00:25:20,421 --> 00:25:20,810
be like,
ah,

507
00:25:20,810 --> 00:25:24,290
you see he two years ago he said 
something else and it's like,

508
00:25:24,291 --> 00:25:26,120
they just want to get you so,
so that,

509
00:25:26,121 --> 00:25:28,420
that should what we really need to 
understand.

510
00:25:28,421 --> 00:25:30,410
Yeah.
So that should be a virtue.

511
00:25:30,950 --> 00:25:32,840
It should be a virtue that you change 
your mind.

512
00:25:32,841 --> 00:25:35,720
I will admit it's hard for me to admit,
but it's true.

513
00:25:35,750 --> 00:25:36,583
It's so difficult when you're constantly
under attack and constantly under siege 

514
00:25:40,340 --> 00:25:42,920
to say it's,
it's far more difficult.

515
00:25:42,921 --> 00:25:44,540
Not only to say I made a mistake,
but like,

516
00:25:44,541 --> 00:25:46,340
look,
I really thought about this and then you

517
00:25:46,341 --> 00:25:47,174
get,
that's why I've stopped reading my 

518
00:25:47,991 --> 00:25:49,460
twitter mentions or facebook and none of
it,

519
00:25:49,461 --> 00:25:54,200
I don't read any of it anymore because 
it's just so filled with hate and rage.

520
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:56,780
And even if you look at the terms we 
use,

521
00:25:56,781 --> 00:25:59,720
the moral valence to terms have like 
flip flopping,

522
00:26:00,310 --> 00:26:03,290
flip flopping is a negative thing.
Like you change your mind,

523
00:26:03,291 --> 00:26:04,124
but you should change your mind if your 
commander in chief and the situation on 

524
00:26:07,521 --> 00:26:09,650
the ground changes,
you didn't have access to that.

525
00:26:09,860 --> 00:26:10,693
Oh,
he flip flop about troops in Iraq or 

526
00:26:11,781 --> 00:26:13,220
bunk Guantanamo.
Well,

527
00:26:13,221 --> 00:26:18,170
we live in a dynamic world where things 
are in flux and they change.

528
00:26:18,680 --> 00:26:20,570
But I have,
I have found,

529
00:26:21,020 --> 00:26:21,853
I have definitely found that being that 
sort of person who's not willing to 

530
00:26:27,651 --> 00:26:28,484
change my mind,
but the open open admission of that on 

531
00:26:31,821 --> 00:26:32,654
twitter or facebook has become more 
difficult as people ramp up their 

532
00:26:36,951 --> 00:26:39,040
personal slanders and attacks.
Yeah.

533
00:26:39,080 --> 00:26:41,420
So I'm,
I'm very aware of that,

534
00:26:41,421 --> 00:26:43,770
that I'm dying to talk to you about 
this.

535
00:26:43,870 --> 00:26:44,330
Yeah.

536
00:26:44,330 --> 00:26:46,830
Diana talked to you about what's been 
going on with you.

537
00:26:46,900 --> 00:26:50,040
I've had some strange things going on.
We'll get there in just one second.

538
00:26:50,550 --> 00:26:55,080
You also had another that sort of attack
on you who sort of similar to what I had

539
00:26:55,081 --> 00:26:55,800
on me,
but that,

540
00:26:55,800 --> 00:26:59,130
but I think you're really onto something
there that I don't think it's,

541
00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:00,270
if someone,
you know,

542
00:27:00,271 --> 00:27:01,290
sometimes people will say,
well,

543
00:27:01,291 --> 00:27:02,690
you said this three years ago,
I,

544
00:27:02,691 --> 00:27:05,100
you used to believe this.
They'll look at some of my tweets when I

545
00:27:05,101 --> 00:27:06,960
was a far left progressive.
Yeah.

546
00:27:07,020 --> 00:27:09,420
And look what used to make fun of white 
people for this.

547
00:27:09,421 --> 00:27:10,201
And I go,
yeah,

548
00:27:10,201 --> 00:27:13,110
you're not proving me.
What are you trying to prove?

549
00:27:13,111 --> 00:27:14,810
You're proving that yes,
I evolved.

550
00:27:15,100 --> 00:27:16,710
He's changed your mind and you say,
wow,

551
00:27:16,711 --> 00:27:19,930
this guy had tooken information and as a
result isn't there,

552
00:27:20,190 --> 00:27:22,320
but you're rational people too.
That's what,

553
00:27:22,330 --> 00:27:23,370
right.
That's what you're supposed to do.

554
00:27:23,430 --> 00:27:25,320
But you're also right about the,
the other point,

555
00:27:25,321 --> 00:27:27,450
which is that when you're under attack 
from people,

556
00:27:27,451 --> 00:27:28,284
when you feel like everything you're 
going to say is that then you stop 

557
00:27:31,350 --> 00:27:34,700
having those nice moments of mayor 
culpas contrition.

558
00:27:34,701 --> 00:27:34,820
Yeah.

559
00:27:34,820 --> 00:27:36,960
You know what else you stop doing,
which is interesting.

560
00:27:37,020 --> 00:27:37,853
You stop asking questions and,
and you might ask the questions 

561
00:27:42,241 --> 00:27:43,740
yourself,
but you,

562
00:27:44,460 --> 00:27:45,293
you don't want to articulate those 
questions or you don't want to 

563
00:27:47,581 --> 00:27:50,040
articulate those rebuttals because you 
don't,

564
00:27:50,070 --> 00:27:50,903
you really don't want to receive 500 
emails and shift through all of the 

565
00:27:53,101 --> 00:27:53,934
telling you you're a shithead and you 
should go die and kill yourself and 

566
00:27:56,580 --> 00:27:58,610
people write in your name and the walls 
is a Nazi.

567
00:27:58,611 --> 00:28:00,600
They see you stopped doing that.
I mean,

568
00:28:00,601 --> 00:28:01,434
like give an example.
I was this film I was in with Michael 

569
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:07,470
Shermer reasons to believe,
and I made a comment about a pussy hats.

570
00:28:07,471 --> 00:28:10,560
These people having pussy ass and,
and it makes it look like we,

571
00:28:10,950 --> 00:28:13,380
this is not the image you want to 
portray.

572
00:28:14,310 --> 00:28:17,190
And someone,
I got an unbelievable amount of,

573
00:28:17,250 --> 00:28:18,083
of,
uh,

574
00:28:18,390 --> 00:28:21,540
just crazy target about that.
But one of the things I thought was,

575
00:28:23,340 --> 00:28:24,173
I almost said I came so close to saying,
do you think Martin Luther King would 

576
00:28:30,380 --> 00:28:33,930
have been more respected or less 
respected if he had a pussy hat on?

577
00:28:34,110 --> 00:28:34,943
I mean,
it would've been the perfect thing to 

578
00:28:35,611 --> 00:28:36,444
say,
but I didn't say it because I didn't 

579
00:28:37,441 --> 00:28:40,620
want hundreds of emails and tweets about
me being a racist.

580
00:28:41,280 --> 00:28:46,230
So I think we're in a precarious 
situation right now.

581
00:28:46,231 --> 00:28:50,010
And I think Sam is getting this crazy 
amounts,

582
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:52,890
asking questions,
opening conversations.

583
00:28:53,070 --> 00:28:55,140
We need to have those conversations.
We need,

584
00:28:55,140 --> 00:28:55,280
I need

585
00:28:55,280 --> 00:28:57,530
to ask those questions.
You're talking about Sam Harris just,

586
00:28:57,531 --> 00:28:58,364
yeah,
Sam Ash,

587
00:28:59,040 --> 00:29:01,430
uh,
had Charles Murray on even Gary Tobbs,

588
00:29:01,431 --> 00:29:03,800
the guy who the,
the anti sugar guy.

589
00:29:03,980 --> 00:29:04,813
So what do you do then if you were in my
position or in Santa this position when 

590
00:29:08,001 --> 00:29:10,210
I see some articles written about 
balance and,

591
00:29:10,250 --> 00:29:11,083
well,
Ruben talked to this guy or this guy or 

592
00:29:12,471 --> 00:29:16,190
this gal and they think this and Ruben 
didn't ask them this and all this stuff.

593
00:29:16,740 --> 00:29:18,260
So Sam gets to this too,
by the way.

594
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:22,250
I mean,
vox did a really hatchet job.

595
00:29:22,280 --> 00:29:24,960
It misrepresents what him and Charles 
Murray talked about,

596
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:27,800
how long a hit pieces and write and and 
slate.

597
00:29:27,801 --> 00:29:30,680
Just wrote something about you were 
going to talk about the conceptual penis

598
00:29:30,681 --> 00:29:33,290
shortly and what happened with with 
salon,

599
00:29:33,560 --> 00:29:34,393
but all of those things they add up to 
us not having any more conversation 

600
00:29:38,930 --> 00:29:40,460
because at some point it's just like,
all right,

601
00:29:40,461 --> 00:29:41,440
well then I'll just yet

602
00:29:41,980 --> 00:29:44,040
I'll just talk to,
it's not that I'll talk to people that I

603
00:29:44,041 --> 00:29:44,874
agree with.
I'll just talk to people who say 

604
00:29:45,371 --> 00:29:46,390
nothing.
That's right.

605
00:29:46,391 --> 00:29:49,120
Because then I've completely insulated 
myself.

606
00:29:49,150 --> 00:29:49,660
Right,
and no,

607
00:29:49,660 --> 00:29:50,950
it'll really show.
So this is,

608
00:29:50,951 --> 00:29:52,510
this is,
I think what we need to do.

609
00:29:53,170 --> 00:29:57,340
I think we need to figure out everybody,
James Lindsey actually gave me this idea

610
00:29:57,341 --> 00:30:00,490
and I think he's absolutely right,
a coauthor of the conceptual penis,

611
00:30:00,491 --> 00:30:01,324
a social contract.
We need to figure out whose voice 

612
00:30:03,251 --> 00:30:04,084
matters.
Certain people matter and in general 

613
00:30:08,321 --> 00:30:13,321
this hate and vitriol comes from the 
least accomplished people who in need.

614
00:30:14,170 --> 00:30:17,050
There's a really nice niche in frame to 
talk about this there.

615
00:30:17,110 --> 00:30:20,610
They viewed,
there's kind of an oversimplified but,

616
00:30:20,620 --> 00:30:23,080
but their slaves,
their situation,

617
00:30:23,081 --> 00:30:27,760
reality is their slaves and they 
discharge these primal urges on people.

618
00:30:27,970 --> 00:30:30,700
It's like the Australians have this term
tall poppy syndrome.

619
00:30:30,730 --> 00:30:31,980
When it's something gross,
hi,

620
00:30:31,981 --> 00:30:32,814
you just cut it down.
So as Ruben grows and subscribers and 

621
00:30:35,091 --> 00:30:36,550
that's where if I could just cut reuben 
down,

622
00:30:36,551 --> 00:30:37,211
you know,
fuck them.

623
00:30:37,211 --> 00:30:40,810
It's kind of that Nazi white supremacy,
homophobia.

624
00:30:41,530 --> 00:30:43,810
So we gay marriage you Nazi homophobe 
right?

625
00:30:44,370 --> 00:30:45,203
I know it's overwhelming,
but we have to figure out whose voices 

626
00:30:48,581 --> 00:30:53,290
matter and then we need to,
we need to have those friendships,

627
00:30:53,291 --> 00:30:54,124
a virtue.
So when people come to us and say 

628
00:30:55,091 --> 00:30:56,380
something,
we can really listen.

629
00:30:56,560 --> 00:30:57,393
But the way to not do it is to look at,
as you've said repeatedly to look at an 

630
00:31:00,761 --> 00:31:01,594
egg on twitter.
It's probably a 12 year old in their 

631
00:31:03,521 --> 00:31:04,354
basement.
We just can't take those voices 

632
00:31:06,281 --> 00:31:07,300
seriously.
All right.

633
00:31:07,301 --> 00:31:10,470
So sort of couched around everything 
we're talking about so far is,

634
00:31:10,530 --> 00:31:11,363
is sort of good and evil.
That tactics that some people use to be 

635
00:31:14,741 --> 00:31:17,470
involved in a conversation and the 
motives that we have,

636
00:31:17,920 --> 00:31:20,370
whether it be because you're a believer 
or a nonbeliever,

637
00:31:20,380 --> 00:31:20,920
anything else.

638
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:21,753
I've come to a place where I think right
now in 2017 we're in a strange spot 

639
00:31:25,721 --> 00:31:26,554
where the fascinating the institutions 
that used to help us keep some of this 

640
00:31:31,241 --> 00:31:32,580
stuff in the lanes.
What,

641
00:31:32,581 --> 00:31:34,450
what is acceptable,
what's not acceptable,

642
00:31:34,451 --> 00:31:36,250
what's right and wrong,
what's real and not real.

643
00:31:36,550 --> 00:31:39,760
Whether it's true or not,
that these institutions are crumbling.

644
00:31:39,761 --> 00:31:41,650
And by that I mean that media is 
crumbling.

645
00:31:41,651 --> 00:31:45,350
Our political institutions seem to be 
crying gimmick institution.

646
00:31:45,351 --> 00:31:47,170
So that's the one I really want to get 
into with you.

647
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:48,273
Um,
all of these things are starting to 

648
00:31:50,741 --> 00:31:51,574
crumble.
It's partly because information has 

649
00:31:52,661 --> 00:31:53,494
changed so much.
I would argue that even worse than 

650
00:31:54,671 --> 00:31:56,710
crumble,
but what you would say they're,

651
00:31:56,711 --> 00:31:58,990
they're decimated already.
No,

652
00:31:59,020 --> 00:32:01,960
no.
I would argue that the academy,

653
00:32:02,020 --> 00:32:05,140
certain sections of the Academy of the 
sciences I think are doing very,

654
00:32:05,141 --> 00:32:08,290
very well.
The humanities are in shambles.

655
00:32:08,290 --> 00:32:11,260
Certain departments,
anything tainted by Postmodernism,

656
00:32:11,290 --> 00:32:13,780
particularly gender studies,
the conceptual penis.

657
00:32:13,830 --> 00:32:15,260
Okay.
Let's pause for a sec.

658
00:32:15,750 --> 00:32:18,610
Okay.
Let's just go to the conceptual penis as

659
00:32:18,611 --> 00:32:20,710
a social construct.
As a social construct,

660
00:32:20,730 --> 00:32:21,563
right?
You wrote a hoax paper with James 

661
00:32:24,700 --> 00:32:25,360
Lindsey,
right?

662
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:29,020
And you got this publish and we thought 
it was extremely funny.

663
00:32:29,950 --> 00:32:30,860
I mean,
I read it,

664
00:32:30,861 --> 00:32:31,250
it,
it's,

665
00:32:31,250 --> 00:32:35,560
it's jaw droppingly ridiculous and 
argued for climate change,

666
00:32:35,640 --> 00:32:36,850
uh,
being responsible.

667
00:32:36,860 --> 00:32:38,200
The conceptual penis.
Yeah.

668
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:40,040
And I thought it was really,
it was a satire,

669
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:43,130
sort of the main takeaway of it is that 
the penis is not really a real thing.

670
00:32:43,131 --> 00:32:48,131
It's just this sort of a morphis idea.
And we threw in a lot of moral jargon.

671
00:32:48,591 --> 00:32:51,170
We throw in what we appeal to their 
moral sensibilities.

672
00:32:51,260 --> 00:32:53,090
Okay.
So why Pete,

673
00:32:53,450 --> 00:32:55,640
you're an academic.
Why would you write a hoax paper?

674
00:32:55,641 --> 00:32:58,680
Why would you mark the very institutions
of which you are?

675
00:32:58,910 --> 00:33:03,290
Because I think that there are 
departments in the universities that are

676
00:33:03,291 --> 00:33:06,770
making a mockery of our institutions.
So when you said crumbling,

677
00:33:06,800 --> 00:33:08,740
I don't think that's right.

678
00:33:09,630 --> 00:33:10,463
Ah,

679
00:33:10,870 --> 00:33:12,660
that's not the word.
I would have used other words.

680
00:33:12,700 --> 00:33:13,533
It's accurate in a sense.
But these people are fabricating not 

681
00:33:17,021 --> 00:33:17,854
only their own knowledge bases,
they're writing things in journals that 

682
00:33:20,501 --> 00:33:25,501
they then site that becomes knowledge.
They have their manufacturing ideas that

683
00:33:26,621 --> 00:33:30,070
are totally untethered to reality.
This is how crazy this is.

684
00:33:30,520 --> 00:33:31,960
So,
so look,

685
00:33:31,961 --> 00:33:33,610
I'm going to explain it.
I'm gonna try explaining this.

686
00:33:33,611 --> 00:33:34,444
You reel me in if this is unclear,
but this is idea is so crazy that 

687
00:33:38,230 --> 00:33:41,260
anybody listening to this exam that 
can't possibly like this,

688
00:33:41,261 --> 00:33:42,094
this can't possibly be true.
So this is the idea and then I'm going 

689
00:33:44,211 --> 00:33:45,044
to give you,
you're asking me what belief I'm going 

690
00:33:46,241 --> 00:33:49,180
to give you an analog and theology.
Okay.

691
00:33:49,450 --> 00:33:50,283
So what these people do is that they 
have moral intuitions based upon is 

692
00:33:59,230 --> 00:34:01,030
thought basically.
I'll get to that in a second.

693
00:34:01,450 --> 00:34:06,450
So what they do to justify this is they 
manufacture their own epistemology,

694
00:34:08,080 --> 00:34:11,920
their own way to know that justifies the
conclusions that they have.

695
00:34:12,100 --> 00:34:14,530
So then they can go out and become 
activists.

696
00:34:14,830 --> 00:34:16,900
Now,
quick detour.

697
00:34:17,080 --> 00:34:18,280
Yeah.
One of the,

698
00:34:19,090 --> 00:34:19,340
hmm.

699
00:34:19,340 --> 00:34:20,173
Biggest problems facing the left right 
now is anybody who calls out a bad idea 

700
00:34:26,840 --> 00:34:30,320
is viewed as somebody on the right.
We've got to stop that.

701
00:34:30,380 --> 00:34:32,600
I know a little something about,
you know,

702
00:34:32,601 --> 00:34:34,280
a little something about this.
Yeah,

703
00:34:34,490 --> 00:34:35,840
a lot about this.
So let's,

704
00:34:35,860 --> 00:34:37,640
I'm going to give you an analogy in 
theology.

705
00:34:37,641 --> 00:34:41,510
So this Guy Alvin Plantinga,
he's a Christian philosopher.

706
00:34:42,110 --> 00:34:46,490
So he has these beliefs,
these,

707
00:34:47,270 --> 00:34:48,103
they're actually more than that.
Their claims about reality and about 

708
00:34:50,001 --> 00:34:50,834
Jesus being the son of God.
So he realizes that there's no evidence 

709
00:34:53,781 --> 00:34:56,090
they can take them there usually.
So what does he do?

710
00:34:56,091 --> 00:34:58,760
He manufactured his own epistemology.
He said,

711
00:34:58,761 --> 00:34:59,331
well,
you know,

712
00:34:59,331 --> 00:35:00,164
we're going to say that there's this 
thing called the God center and the God 

713
00:35:02,571 --> 00:35:04,700
center.
Some people have it and it allows you to

714
00:35:04,730 --> 00:35:09,140
just as I apprehend the color red,
so to do I apprehend God.

715
00:35:09,170 --> 00:35:10,003
So he makes an epistemology to justify 
these insane claims about the nature of 

716
00:35:13,190 --> 00:35:15,450
reality.
So just as he has done that

717
00:35:18,250 --> 00:35:22,390
critical theory is that epistemology 
that is used,

718
00:35:22,391 --> 00:35:25,900
and I can explain that is complex.
I'm afraid we're gonna lose people.

719
00:35:26,410 --> 00:35:28,060
We got a lot of terms we've got to throw
out.

720
00:35:28,090 --> 00:35:28,923
It's very complicated.
But what I would like to attempt to do 

721
00:35:31,121 --> 00:35:31,954
in this segment is to link the madness 
on campuses right now to the 

722
00:35:36,101 --> 00:35:38,790
intellectual engines driving that 
madness.

723
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:40,113
And the make no mistake about it.
These departments tainted by 

724
00:35:45,211 --> 00:35:49,620
postmodernism are absolutely filled with
zealots and morally motivated.

725
00:35:49,621 --> 00:35:50,454
Either ideologues,
I'll do a little catch up so that in 

726
00:35:53,131 --> 00:35:54,900
case anyone's missing anything.
So first let's,

727
00:35:54,930 --> 00:35:57,410
let's talk about what is postmodernism.
I know,

728
00:35:57,420 --> 00:35:58,620
I know,
most knows that,

729
00:35:58,621 --> 00:36:00,450
but let's just,
let's just do a couple of definitions.

730
00:36:00,451 --> 00:36:03,090
Quicks okay,
so let's do the definition.

731
00:36:03,120 --> 00:36:05,970
So,
okay,

732
00:36:06,120 --> 00:36:11,120
so the Frankfurt,
Frankfurt school has this idea of,

733
00:36:11,640 --> 00:36:12,990
well that's even,
go back for it.

734
00:36:12,991 --> 00:36:14,370
Let's go back to Karl Marx.

735
00:36:14,370 --> 00:36:16,770
Karl Marx was a philosopher.
Ooh,

736
00:36:16,771 --> 00:36:19,650
here's a bonus question.
Why did Hitler hate call marks?

737
00:36:20,610 --> 00:36:22,140
I feel like there's a good punchline.
Well,

738
00:36:22,141 --> 00:36:23,910
it's not a joke.
It's actually true cause he was a Jew.

739
00:36:24,530 --> 00:36:28,650
Jews touched where,
but otherwise they are great guy.

740
00:36:28,660 --> 00:36:28,921
No,
no,

741
00:36:28,921 --> 00:36:29,810
no.
Um,

742
00:36:30,770 --> 00:36:31,710
uh,
okay.

743
00:36:31,711 --> 00:36:32,544
So,
so mark's Marxist economics and these 

744
00:36:37,441 --> 00:36:38,274
people aren't Marxists.
They're more Marxian would be a better 

745
00:36:40,171 --> 00:36:42,810
term marks.
Economics looks at the world in terms of

746
00:36:42,811 --> 00:36:45,330
economical pressure,
their oppressor classes,

747
00:36:45,331 --> 00:36:50,250
et cetera.
So they have,

748
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:53,100
and then we'll get to the idea of 
postmodern postmodernism.

749
00:36:53,130 --> 00:36:53,963
Very,
it's as simple and complicated should 

750
00:36:55,801 --> 00:36:56,634
they've taken this idea of these Marxian
notions of oppressor classes and looked 

751
00:37:02,161 --> 00:37:07,161
at them in terms of gender and race and 
for example,

752
00:37:07,321 --> 00:37:08,154
the patriarchy.
And then they have hierarchically 

753
00:37:10,741 --> 00:37:15,120
prioritized people within that list.
So the Patriarchy is white,

754
00:37:15,240 --> 00:37:16,920
heterosexual,
cisgendered,

755
00:37:16,921 --> 00:37:18,540
which is a thing males.

756
00:37:19,050 --> 00:37:22,070
And they want it at the top of this.
We're a bank.

757
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:23,970
I am.
Absolutely.

758
00:37:24,900 --> 00:37:26,880
But that's the other thing they do just 
like religion,

759
00:37:26,881 --> 00:37:29,250
they have their own defense mechanisms 
and that's what they say.

760
00:37:29,251 --> 00:37:31,680
Well you can't criticize it because 
you're a CIS gendered,

761
00:37:31,681 --> 00:37:32,514
white,
heterosexual male and and is the 

762
00:37:34,470 --> 00:37:38,610
ultimate irony of this.
That is prejudice.

763
00:37:38,700 --> 00:37:40,560
That is prejudging.
Ah,

764
00:37:40,820 --> 00:37:42,670
okay.
I,

765
00:37:42,930 --> 00:37:45,120
I then sit here and go,
wait a minute.

766
00:37:45,210 --> 00:37:46,680
Okay.
Aigner but cozy in a white,

767
00:37:46,681 --> 00:37:47,514
straight CIS gendered male.
So we judge you based on your immutable 

768
00:37:51,211 --> 00:37:52,030
characteristic.
Okay.

769
00:37:52,030 --> 00:37:52,863
So this is indispensable to talk about.
So you are using words based upon 

770
00:38:00,301 --> 00:38:02,040
normal,
ordinary definition.

771
00:38:02,041 --> 00:38:03,150
I'll give you an example some more.
It's like,

772
00:38:03,151 --> 00:38:03,984
so when you use racism,
it's the way I use most people who 

773
00:38:07,171 --> 00:38:08,004
aren't in,
haven't been indoctrinated by gender 

774
00:38:09,781 --> 00:38:10,614
studies and the postmodern left.
It's the idea that you do not judge 

775
00:38:13,681 --> 00:38:14,514
people particularly negatively,
but you don't make judgments about 

776
00:38:15,901 --> 00:38:18,690
people based upon an immutable 
characteristic like their skin color.

777
00:38:19,230 --> 00:38:22,800
But they've changed that definition to 
make it systemic racism.

778
00:38:23,100 --> 00:38:25,650
They've changed that definite definition
to put in,

779
00:38:25,880 --> 00:38:28,020
um,
a power vector,

780
00:38:28,170 --> 00:38:31,170
that hierarchical power vector that only
flows one way.

781
00:38:31,350 --> 00:38:35,770
So for example,
and this blacks cannot be racist whites,

782
00:38:36,130 --> 00:38:38,470
so they have snuck,
it's very sneaky.

783
00:38:38,471 --> 00:38:42,050
They've taken a normal word,
added a,

784
00:38:42,060 --> 00:38:42,840
a,
a,

785
00:38:42,840 --> 00:38:46,330
a moral component to it and change the 
definition of a word.

786
00:38:46,700 --> 00:38:47,191
It,
it,

787
00:38:47,191 --> 00:38:48,250
you know,
here's some,

788
00:38:48,460 --> 00:38:50,350
if I may give you some more examples,
like,

789
00:38:50,470 --> 00:38:52,360
um,
equality.

790
00:38:52,750 --> 00:38:53,583
Equality is a good thing,
but they've shifted from a quality to 

791
00:38:56,141 --> 00:38:58,000
equity.
Now what does equity mean?

792
00:38:58,390 --> 00:39:01,180
Equity means where we need a certain 
number of people,

793
00:39:01,360 --> 00:39:04,360
representative of the general population
of 17% African Americans.

794
00:39:04,361 --> 00:39:07,810
We need to have 17% but the problem is 
that that,

795
00:39:08,440 --> 00:39:09,273
that they also want to take in to 
account historical discrimination and a 

796
00:39:14,051 --> 00:39:16,150
kind of reparations for that.

797
00:39:16,150 --> 00:39:18,100
So those numbers are even higher.
So it's,

798
00:39:18,280 --> 00:39:19,113
I think it can be summarized in Ruth 
Bader Ginsburg's quip or joke or 

799
00:39:23,621 --> 00:39:25,080
whatever it is.
How many few females,

800
00:39:25,081 --> 00:39:28,150
Supreme Court justices do you think 
there should be nine.

801
00:39:28,810 --> 00:39:29,643
So it's not just right,
it's not just that we want equal 

802
00:39:32,561 --> 00:39:37,561
representation,
we want more because of past injustices.

803
00:39:40,180 --> 00:39:42,330
Go ahead.
Because this is this get,

804
00:39:42,340 --> 00:39:45,100
we got to talk about deconstruction.
We got to talk about violence.

805
00:39:45,101 --> 00:39:45,934
We can talk about why all these things.
When you understand them from this 

806
00:39:49,301 --> 00:39:50,134
mindset,
they're all coming from the same school 

807
00:39:51,701 --> 00:39:55,080
of thought effected by critical theory.
That's why the most inelegant,

808
00:39:55,090 --> 00:39:56,430
let's define critical theory.
Yeah.

809
00:39:56,450 --> 00:40:01,120
So critical theory is this idea that 
you,

810
00:40:01,770 --> 00:40:02,603
um,
that traditional power dynamics and 

811
00:40:07,241 --> 00:40:09,160
traditional,
and this is oversimplified,

812
00:40:09,161 --> 00:40:09,994
but it's a general idea from which we 
can have a starting point for a 

813
00:40:11,921 --> 00:40:13,910
conversation.
See,

814
00:40:13,930 --> 00:40:15,280
that's again,
I thought to myself,

815
00:40:15,310 --> 00:40:18,700
I'm going to get 500 emails and just 
trying to,

816
00:40:18,730 --> 00:40:20,360
and it makes me again,
it,

817
00:40:20,410 --> 00:40:23,680
it makes me self sensor and then I'm 
like come on.

818
00:40:23,830 --> 00:40:24,663
Yeah,
okay.

819
00:40:24,890 --> 00:40:26,020
That's a real,
that's a real,

820
00:40:26,021 --> 00:40:28,090
I don't want to get lost in that.
That is a real thing.

821
00:40:28,091 --> 00:40:28,924
I mean I find it for myself to know is I
tried to talk broadly about things 

822
00:40:31,630 --> 00:40:34,930
because I want to communicate big ideas 
and hopefully people will then read some

823
00:40:34,931 --> 00:40:35,764
books or watched some other videos or 
follow some other people on twitter or 

824
00:40:38,651 --> 00:40:40,150
whatever.
And then even if you talk about,

825
00:40:40,200 --> 00:40:41,310
well he,
he,

826
00:40:41,360 --> 00:40:42,520
yeah,
he wept over that.

827
00:40:42,521 --> 00:40:43,440
Right?
Or he didn't know that.

828
00:40:43,441 --> 00:40:44,274
So why didn't you talk about the 
Frankfurt school like quick you didn't 

829
00:40:46,361 --> 00:40:48,220
mention Horkheimer wants,
are doing over.

830
00:40:48,230 --> 00:40:50,370
All these guys are let guys know.
And you know,

831
00:40:50,380 --> 00:40:51,213
just,
you just get to a point where all of 

832
00:40:52,751 --> 00:40:55,090
that stuff just centering essentially.
It just,

833
00:40:55,091 --> 00:40:59,260
it's not dementia is the message.
It's not good for you.

834
00:40:59,261 --> 00:41:01,660
It's not good for conversations.
It's not good for,

835
00:41:02,200 --> 00:41:02,981
okay.
So anyway,

836
00:41:02,981 --> 00:41:03,814
that's why I mentioned the think was 
efficient and I think that was an 

837
00:41:07,750 --> 00:41:08,583
acquisition right now if you think for 
yourself and you are not afraid to buck 

838
00:41:11,981 --> 00:41:13,780
the trend,
they will come to get you.

839
00:41:13,781 --> 00:41:15,250
It's exactly,
we're talking about so critical theory.

840
00:41:16,030 --> 00:41:18,490
So it's the idea

841
00:41:18,700 --> 00:41:21,550
that um,
the,

842
00:41:21,551 --> 00:41:22,384
it's basically a Marxist idea.
It's the idea that there are these 

843
00:41:25,811 --> 00:41:29,950
entrenched power structures and 
entrenched power dynamics.

844
00:41:30,280 --> 00:41:31,113
And one of the things that we need to do
is we need to recognize these and then 

845
00:41:34,371 --> 00:41:36,800
we need to overthrow the,
we need to deconstruct these traditional

846
00:41:36,801 --> 00:41:40,760
hierarchies to make society more.
That's the thing.

847
00:41:40,790 --> 00:41:41,870
More equitable,
more fair,

848
00:41:41,871 --> 00:41:43,310
more what did it,
what is it?

849
00:41:43,340 --> 00:41:48,230
It's complicated.
So these kids protesting at evergreen or

850
00:41:48,231 --> 00:41:49,064
have,
they don't just x Niello just get this 

851
00:41:50,421 --> 00:41:52,530
idea that they just gonna it just does 
it.

852
00:41:52,700 --> 00:41:53,990
No,
they get this.

853
00:41:54,500 --> 00:41:55,333
These are coming out of specific 
departments in the university and when 

854
00:41:59,991 --> 00:42:01,760
they're asked,
why do you do this?

855
00:42:01,761 --> 00:42:03,170
So what is this?
They they talk,

856
00:42:03,200 --> 00:42:05,800
well my professor said this and then 
this is the,

857
00:42:05,850 --> 00:42:09,020
the insane part that gets back to the 
conceptual penis again.

858
00:42:09,620 --> 00:42:12,800
That these people have their own lines 
of literature.

859
00:42:13,250 --> 00:42:17,260
That is the,
these are intellectual cesspools to have

860
00:42:17,630 --> 00:42:19,560
that's going to be talking about,
no,

861
00:42:19,850 --> 00:42:24,850
so they have their tags that they have 
manufactured what they think.

862
00:42:28,311 --> 00:42:30,470
That's why they have to like with 
cultural appropriation,

863
00:42:30,471 --> 00:42:33,870
they have to import ideas like power 
because it isn't it,

864
00:42:34,010 --> 00:42:34,843
the whole thing is made up.
It's completely fabricated because they 

865
00:42:37,251 --> 00:42:39,710
want to use,
they want to overthrow these traditional

866
00:42:39,711 --> 00:42:40,544
hierarchies.
So these kids get this idea from their 

867
00:42:43,821 --> 00:42:44,654
professors who then get promoted and 
tenure because they publish in journals 

868
00:42:48,320 --> 00:42:50,600
and their stuff is almost never cited by
anybody.

869
00:42:51,020 --> 00:42:51,853
But yet that's how you rise up.
And then what happens is you have a 

870
00:42:55,311 --> 00:42:56,144
whole Canon of knowledge and you go out 
and teach people and then you have 

871
00:43:00,561 --> 00:43:02,450
diversity training and,
and the,

872
00:43:02,451 --> 00:43:06,320
the shame of this whole thing is that 
there is legitimacy to white power.

873
00:43:06,530 --> 00:43:09,170
There is legitimacy to some of this 
stuff,

874
00:43:09,200 --> 00:43:10,033
but the way that it's metastasized 
almost doesn't allow any kind of 

875
00:43:17,030 --> 00:43:17,863
liberation.

876
00:43:17,870 --> 00:43:22,040
It does almost the exact opposite of 
what they want to do because it gets you

877
00:43:22,041 --> 00:43:23,980
people like trump.
But one more thing I would say.

878
00:43:24,010 --> 00:43:24,541
Yeah,
but,

879
00:43:24,541 --> 00:43:25,374
but then what happens is it goes to 
colleges of education and then they 

880
00:43:28,491 --> 00:43:32,120
start teaching.
And I think I told you my son has in his

881
00:43:32,121 --> 00:43:36,680
geography has geography,
civics.

882
00:43:37,040 --> 00:43:38,720
I can't remember.
I'm looking at stuff he doesn't,

883
00:43:38,870 --> 00:43:41,480
they've never even opened a map.
They've never opened a map.

884
00:43:41,481 --> 00:43:44,480
They've never in civics class,
how many Supreme Court justices?

885
00:43:44,481 --> 00:43:46,370
Legislative branch,
how many said none of that stuff.

886
00:43:46,850 --> 00:43:48,740
But he knows everything about the black 
panthers.

887
00:43:49,010 --> 00:43:50,480
But he knows everything about the civil 
rights.

888
00:43:50,590 --> 00:43:52,910
The civil rights movement is extremely 
important.

889
00:43:53,930 --> 00:43:57,070
Wonderful stuff.
But it should not.

890
00:43:57,080 --> 00:43:58,430
We need to look,
I'm looking at him at,

891
00:43:58,431 --> 00:44:00,740
we need kids need to know what countries
above Canada.

892
00:44:00,741 --> 00:44:01,574
Anyway,
all of this stuff gets back to certain 

893
00:44:03,231 --> 00:44:04,064
departments in the university that are 
pumping out nonsense that are 

894
00:44:06,801 --> 00:44:09,590
indoctrinating people and exactly like a
religion,

895
00:44:09,591 --> 00:44:12,230
they have their own defensive structures
there.

896
00:44:12,500 --> 00:44:13,333
You know,
being offended as the new thing I 

897
00:44:15,171 --> 00:44:18,050
inclusion is another word that they've 
changed the meaning of.

898
00:44:18,410 --> 00:44:21,980
So there was a direct line between is 
this company,

899
00:44:21,981 --> 00:44:23,810
is this clear so far?
I'm with you to me.

900
00:44:24,260 --> 00:44:24,770
Yeah.
Okay.

901
00:44:24,770 --> 00:44:26,720
So there's a judge with the audience.
Okay.

902
00:44:26,721 --> 00:44:28,930
So cause if it's not clear,
something needs to be unpacked.

903
00:44:28,940 --> 00:44:29,773
So they want to overthrow these 
traditional and they've manufactured 

904
00:44:33,121 --> 00:44:36,240
their own base of scholarship to do so.
So how would you,

905
00:44:36,360 --> 00:44:39,750
that's why it's worse than crumbling 
because at least if something crumbles,

906
00:44:40,140 --> 00:44:44,040
something worse didn't take its place.
Like if in a lot like it's like a having

907
00:44:44,041 --> 00:44:44,874
an alarm clock that rings randomly.
So it's worse than just having an alarm 

908
00:44:47,551 --> 00:44:49,200
clock that doesn't work.
It's,

909
00:44:49,201 --> 00:44:50,034
they're pumping out fabricated nonsense.
It's totally untethered to reality in 

910
00:44:53,640 --> 00:44:55,620
the moment you call these people out on 
it.

911
00:44:56,280 --> 00:44:58,740
They don't believe in dialogue in any 
way they deal.

912
00:44:58,920 --> 00:44:59,753
They'll slander you.
The write your name on the bathroom 

913
00:45:00,991 --> 00:45:02,190
wall,
they'll scream at you.

914
00:45:02,430 --> 00:45:04,220
So the only thing to do is you've got to
hoax some you,

915
00:45:04,221 --> 00:45:05,054
you,
you got to have a nontraditional way to 

916
00:45:06,691 --> 00:45:07,524
deal with people who are so 
fundamentally irrational that they're 

917
00:45:11,190 --> 00:45:16,190
going to have a conversation and that 
led you to writing this hoax and turning

918
00:45:16,951 --> 00:45:18,780
this thing on its head.
All right there,

919
00:45:18,781 --> 00:45:19,860
there was so much there I want to get 
to.

920
00:45:19,861 --> 00:45:22,980
So first of all,
what's the connection with the religious

921
00:45:22,981 --> 00:45:24,990
mind that people have?
Wonderful,

922
00:45:25,200 --> 00:45:29,880
this strikes me as the new religion 
politics but,

923
00:45:29,910 --> 00:45:34,230
but this leftist postmodern marks and 
stuff that this is the new religion.

924
00:45:34,260 --> 00:45:35,093
They,
they mon hundred bakemark everyone else 

925
00:45:36,901 --> 00:45:37,734
for their beliefs,
but they have a belief that is so 

926
00:45:40,441 --> 00:45:45,441
tethered to their own being that if you 
challenge it in any way they outcome,

927
00:45:46,250 --> 00:45:47,460
well they'll hate you.

928
00:45:47,460 --> 00:45:50,580
But they'll also outkast anyone 100% 
correct.

929
00:45:50,610 --> 00:45:54,270
And so what do you say about that?
So that is an awesome question.

930
00:45:54,271 --> 00:45:57,870
So Lindsay and I wrote him on every now 
and wrote and wrote a paper again,

931
00:45:57,940 --> 00:45:58,773
uh,
privileges the original sin for the 

932
00:46:00,001 --> 00:46:01,470
left.
So,

933
00:46:01,500 --> 00:46:05,300
but there is one fundamental difference.
You're,

934
00:46:05,380 --> 00:46:06,213
you're having schermer and prager come 
into the studio and debate and it's 

935
00:46:09,301 --> 00:46:11,520
going to be civilized.
No one's going to punch each other.

936
00:46:11,730 --> 00:46:14,580
They have fundamental,
actually very fundamental,

937
00:46:14,581 --> 00:46:15,414
just moral disagreements.
And one of them prager blends that you 

938
00:46:19,051 --> 00:46:19,884
cannot have morality without God.
And shermer believes the complete 

939
00:46:22,741 --> 00:46:24,900
opposite.
So this is powerful stuff,

940
00:46:24,920 --> 00:46:26,490
right?
They've agreed and they're going to have

941
00:46:26,491 --> 00:46:29,060
a dialogue about that.
And I'm not going to score,

942
00:46:29,130 --> 00:46:30,520
I don't know if it's a debate.
I,

943
00:46:30,530 --> 00:46:31,710
I,
I don't really,

944
00:46:31,800 --> 00:46:34,650
I'm not a fan of Beta.
Having a conversation is much better.

945
00:46:35,010 --> 00:46:38,700
But so,
so you have the same mechanisms in the,

946
00:46:39,120 --> 00:46:42,000
in this new secular religion,
you have privilege,

947
00:46:42,030 --> 00:46:46,560
which is a type of original sin.
You have blasphemy laws,

948
00:46:46,561 --> 00:46:49,830
which are political correctness.
We're really clear that.

949
00:46:50,180 --> 00:46:51,910
So would you say the privileges,
the originals,

950
00:46:51,920 --> 00:46:54,120
and that's like saying Jesus died for 
your sins,

951
00:46:54,121 --> 00:46:55,410
basically.
Like you're,

952
00:46:55,440 --> 00:46:59,210
if you were born white and especially 
CIS gendered heterosexual,

953
00:46:59,220 --> 00:47:02,200
that Shit that you are,
that you are the,

954
00:47:02,340 --> 00:47:04,080
there's nothing you can ditch.
Yeah.

955
00:47:04,160 --> 00:47:07,440
To.
And this is the part that except bow,

956
00:47:07,470 --> 00:47:08,303
this is the part that's the mind blow.
And this is the part that makes me 

957
00:47:11,610 --> 00:47:12,443
unbelievably sympathetic to Christians 
in particular as opposed to other 

958
00:47:15,991 --> 00:47:16,824
religions.
That's really changed my mind 

959
00:47:17,581 --> 00:47:20,970
significantly.
Christians have a redemption narrative.

960
00:47:21,360 --> 00:47:23,670
These people have no redemption 
narrative.

961
00:47:23,940 --> 00:47:25,350
If you're a privileged,
that's it.

962
00:47:25,351 --> 00:47:26,790
You're fucked.
Like you,

963
00:47:26,830 --> 00:47:28,440
there is no redemption for you.

964
00:47:28,440 --> 00:47:31,710
You can bow down for us.
Yeah.

965
00:47:32,110 --> 00:47:35,920
So there,
there's something about being able to be

966
00:47:35,921 --> 00:47:36,754
redeemed that these people don't have.
And that's why you see these vitriolic 

967
00:47:40,600 --> 00:47:44,650
attacks.
They're merciless on other people on the

968
00:47:44,651 --> 00:47:46,950
left eating other people on the left,
the old,

969
00:47:46,990 --> 00:47:47,711
the old bras,
you know,

970
00:47:47,711 --> 00:47:49,210
the snake that eats itself.
Yeah.

971
00:47:50,110 --> 00:47:50,943
So,
okay.

972
00:47:51,550 --> 00:47:52,091
Yeah.
So yeah,

973
00:47:52,091 --> 00:47:54,310
so it is a new secular religion and they
have,

974
00:47:54,340 --> 00:47:56,650
maybe we have modules in our brain,
I don't know.

975
00:47:56,651 --> 00:47:58,920
And maybe it's covariant there with 
culture.

976
00:47:58,921 --> 00:48:00,730
There are things in the culture and act 
in our brain.

977
00:48:01,030 --> 00:48:03,370
And we have the same thing we have in 
Jonathan hightest.

978
00:48:03,371 --> 00:48:06,490
It talked about three of purity versus 
saying to maybe we have,

979
00:48:07,060 --> 00:48:09,460
you know,
ways of interpreting reality,

980
00:48:09,610 --> 00:48:12,130
but make no mistake,
this is a secular religion.

981
00:48:12,190 --> 00:48:14,830
And when you call out the emperor having
no clothes,

982
00:48:15,150 --> 00:48:17,260
you dad is that you have committed,

983
00:48:18,190 --> 00:48:19,540
you are in trouble.
Right.

984
00:48:19,600 --> 00:48:20,433
Which I think has a bit to do have the,
the recent hatchet jobs that have been 

985
00:48:23,591 --> 00:48:24,424
done on me and you,
so sleep basically wrote a piece about 

986
00:48:26,351 --> 00:48:27,790
you after this whole thing,
right?

987
00:48:27,791 --> 00:48:29,770
And it really was kind of strong madding
what you did,

988
00:48:29,771 --> 00:48:31,600
but the attacks were also kind of 
personal.

989
00:48:31,910 --> 00:48:32,820
And that's

990
00:48:33,150 --> 00:48:34,910
always is an interesting,
you know,

991
00:48:34,911 --> 00:48:38,970
in salon goes after me or you asleep 
cause after me or you or Sam,

992
00:48:38,980 --> 00:48:39,621
whoever Harris,
who,

993
00:48:39,621 --> 00:48:43,160
wherever they go after there was a kind 
of Pr Animus.

994
00:48:43,230 --> 00:48:47,640
There's a kind of personal attack that 
is not just a,

995
00:48:47,641 --> 00:48:49,140
an engagement of the,
hey look,

996
00:48:49,141 --> 00:48:49,831
you know,
you did this,

997
00:48:49,831 --> 00:48:50,880
this is why it's not right.
Right,

998
00:48:50,881 --> 00:48:52,070
right.
You know it's not,

999
00:48:52,080 --> 00:48:53,070
oh yeah,
maybe it was funny,

1000
00:48:53,071 --> 00:48:55,260
but you're wrong about this and here's 
why.

1001
00:48:55,261 --> 00:48:59,220
Oh,
deeply personal attack on someone.

1002
00:48:59,221 --> 00:49:00,054
So I called them on the phone.
I think I emailed them at least one toy 

1003
00:49:02,820 --> 00:49:03,990
few times and I said,
look,

1004
00:49:03,991 --> 00:49:04,824
you guys wrote this about me.
I would like an opportunity to respond 

1005
00:49:08,311 --> 00:49:10,110
to this.
Nothing.

1006
00:49:10,200 --> 00:49:11,670
Then I went on twitter and I said,
hey,

1007
00:49:11,671 --> 00:49:13,150
can I please have an opportunity to 
just,

1008
00:49:13,151 --> 00:49:13,984
well you know he won't sleep.
I don't know the exact wording was but 

1009
00:49:15,901 --> 00:49:18,270
can I,
I'd like an opportunity.

1010
00:49:18,271 --> 00:49:21,000
Nothing.
I would like an arbitrary,

1011
00:49:21,001 --> 00:49:22,560
I don't know.
Maybe that's a new thing in journalism.

1012
00:49:22,561 --> 00:49:23,394
Like you just write hit pieces on 
someone and then you don't give him an 

1013
00:49:24,820 --> 00:49:25,270
office.

1014
00:49:25,270 --> 00:49:27,060
I think Hayes,
I think it is.

1015
00:49:27,061 --> 00:49:29,820
I think what's starting to happen is 
that because journal isn't,

1016
00:49:29,821 --> 00:49:31,890
because mainstream journalism is 
crumbling.

1017
00:49:31,910 --> 00:49:33,480
Yeah.
I still use that,

1018
00:49:33,540 --> 00:49:37,400
that adjective there and,
and nobody cares about CNN anymore.

1019
00:49:37,401 --> 00:49:39,180
Right.
And even the New York Times I think has,

1020
00:49:39,181 --> 00:49:40,014
has gone in a really terrible direction 
cause they love a lot of the ideas that 

1021
00:49:42,961 --> 00:49:43,794
you're talking about.
But since the institutions are 

1022
00:49:45,031 --> 00:49:45,864
crumbling,
well now everybody just picks their 

1023
00:49:46,921 --> 00:49:47,754
website that they can try.
Those websites are funded by all sorts 

1024
00:49:49,861 --> 00:49:50,694
of different things.
And if you've got an editor who has 

1025
00:49:52,081 --> 00:49:55,170
bought in to your postmodern bullshit in
this case,

1026
00:49:55,380 --> 00:49:56,213
well you know,
you can say whatever the hell you want 

1027
00:49:57,181 --> 00:49:57,931
about Peter,
Dave,

1028
00:49:57,931 --> 00:49:59,760
or whoever else and you're going to get 
backing.

1029
00:49:59,761 --> 00:50:00,594
So for this whole craziness that 
happened with me and mother Jones says 

1030
00:50:03,530 --> 00:50:05,370
truth,
truth has been removed from that.

1031
00:50:05,390 --> 00:50:05,930
Right,
right.

1032
00:50:05,930 --> 00:50:09,240
Which has been removed from that and to,
for them for this editor.

1033
00:50:09,300 --> 00:50:11,790
So they,
the title of the thing was about the,

1034
00:50:11,820 --> 00:50:15,570
the new extremist further to the right.
We have to talk about that.

1035
00:50:15,571 --> 00:50:18,640
So we have to talk about that.
I have to be out of your mind or,

1036
00:50:18,850 --> 00:50:19,683
or,
or just a lie are of the highest order 

1037
00:50:21,451 --> 00:50:22,530
to think that of me.
You can,

1038
00:50:22,531 --> 00:50:24,570
yeah.
You can criticize me for all you want.

1039
00:50:24,571 --> 00:50:25,640
I,
I address criticism.

1040
00:50:25,650 --> 00:50:27,010
I hear if people think I don't ask the 
right,

1041
00:50:28,080 --> 00:50:30,560
it's not just that he's a terrible 
journalist.

1042
00:50:30,830 --> 00:50:33,620
He has a religious mindset.
Like,

1043
00:50:33,621 --> 00:50:35,570
this is a religion to these people.
So that,

1044
00:50:35,571 --> 00:50:38,420
so that's the interesting thing.
So then I went on the full on,

1045
00:50:38,421 --> 00:50:39,500
I mean I was like,
you know what?

1046
00:50:39,501 --> 00:50:40,940
You picked the wrong person to fuck 
with.

1047
00:50:40,990 --> 00:50:44,450
Right.
And I went on the absolute attack.

1048
00:50:44,600 --> 00:50:45,433
I was defended publicly by you Brogan 
and a whole slew of other people to the 

1049
00:50:50,870 --> 00:50:52,490
tens of thousands of retweets and things
of that.

1050
00:50:52,850 --> 00:50:57,410
And then V to I guess two days ago,
he was writing about how noah,

1051
00:50:57,411 --> 00:50:59,570
he doesn't believe I'm an extremist,
but he doesn't,

1052
00:51:00,170 --> 00:51:01,760
you know,
there's no public correction.

1053
00:51:01,761 --> 00:51:02,594
They do slight things at the end of the 
article that no one's gonna ever see 

1054
00:51:05,090 --> 00:51:07,460
wikipedia that is still run with the 
real thing.

1055
00:51:07,560 --> 00:51:08,393
Exactly.
Goes,

1056
00:51:08,450 --> 00:51:10,220
I tagged the editor,
this woman,

1057
00:51:10,221 --> 00:51:12,620
Clara Jeffery and all of the,
in all the tweets,

1058
00:51:12,621 --> 00:51:13,454
she never responds.
She's never gotten this much twitter 

1059
00:51:14,781 --> 00:51:15,614
attraction,
but they don't feel a need to because 

1060
00:51:17,631 --> 00:51:21,320
they know that their monster is just 
going to keep moving forward.

1061
00:51:21,380 --> 00:51:23,330
And that's what I'm trying to figure out
the antidote.

1062
00:51:23,331 --> 00:51:24,164
So just to be clear,
you and so what did he say about your 

1063
00:51:27,561 --> 00:51:30,570
show?
The title and you can look at it.

1064
00:51:30,590 --> 00:51:31,423
Maybe it still is pinned tweet right now
though I suspect he's either deleted it 

1065
00:51:33,630 --> 00:51:34,463
or removed it all together was something
about the rise of the new extremism or 

1066
00:51:39,171 --> 00:51:42,620
the newest extremists that are further 
to the right than Breitbart.

1067
00:51:42,740 --> 00:51:45,950
Then he includes me in that where he 
refers to me as far right,

1068
00:51:46,020 --> 00:51:46,853
right.
Then eventually change that to just 

1069
00:51:47,990 --> 00:51:51,710
write which the right left thing doesn't
even make any sense anymore.

1070
00:51:51,711 --> 00:51:54,230
I can put all that aside.
As I mentioned at the top,

1071
00:51:54,231 --> 00:51:56,300
Forbes called this a conservative show 
last week.

1072
00:51:57,020 --> 00:51:57,853
I've said to you,
I think you were the first one I ever 

1073
00:51:58,791 --> 00:51:59,624
said it to,
that defending my liberal principles is 

1074
00:52:01,221 --> 00:52:02,054
becoming a conservative position.
So all of these labels are starting to 

1075
00:52:05,121 --> 00:52:05,954
make no sense and that's just part of 
the what's happened here and that sort 

1076
00:52:08,761 --> 00:52:10,070
of thing.
So a couple of things here.

1077
00:52:10,070 --> 00:52:10,903
If you had an itemized checklist,
if you could just write your beliefs 

1078
00:52:13,431 --> 00:52:14,264
down and you check you and I would both 
overwhelmingly fall into the liberal 

1079
00:52:18,261 --> 00:52:19,520
camp,
not the left camp.

1080
00:52:19,540 --> 00:52:20,373
Right.
And that's why I've been saying liberal 

1081
00:52:21,741 --> 00:52:23,610
is not left.
Dad is a crane.

1082
00:52:23,660 --> 00:52:26,000
It's from state complaint.
But just to be clear for you,

1083
00:52:26,270 --> 00:52:29,060
so without naming the person who wrote 
the article,

1084
00:52:29,150 --> 00:52:30,190
the guy who wrote the article that would
make,

1085
00:52:30,200 --> 00:52:31,310
yeah,
Josh Harkinson.

1086
00:52:31,510 --> 00:52:34,910
Okay.
Is Josh invited on your show?

1087
00:52:34,940 --> 00:52:36,200
Yeah,
I invited him immediately.

1088
00:52:36,201 --> 00:52:38,540
I said No.
Is he still invited on your show?

1089
00:52:38,541 --> 00:52:41,930
And he wrote something started like 
first I said,

1090
00:52:42,350 --> 00:52:43,183
come on my show,
I'll give you the first 10 minutes 

1091
00:52:44,421 --> 00:52:46,220
without talking.
He didn't respond to that.

1092
00:52:46,490 --> 00:52:49,640
Then today,
finally days later I respond to it again

1093
00:52:49,641 --> 00:52:51,920
and say,
or the day we're taping,

1094
00:52:51,930 --> 00:52:54,350
this is off of when we're airing it.

1095
00:52:54,360 --> 00:52:56,330
But today I wrote,
you know,

1096
00:52:56,331 --> 00:52:58,640
will you come on the show?
You Hack.

1097
00:52:58,790 --> 00:53:01,140
So then I was being a little more heavy 
handed and you're old.

1098
00:53:01,160 --> 00:53:02,510
I won't come on cause you called me a 
name.

1099
00:53:02,940 --> 00:53:05,810
I mean how many wouldn't come?
So the hack thing was just an excuse,

1100
00:53:06,830 --> 00:53:07,663
just to be completely clear.
You said I was going to sit here for 10 

1101
00:53:09,981 --> 00:53:11,240
minutes or so.
You'd come on,

1102
00:53:11,241 --> 00:53:12,074
you can sit here and 10 minutes I will 
sit here and I wasn't anything outside 

1103
00:53:14,691 --> 00:53:15,710
of the editor too,
by the way.

1104
00:53:15,711 --> 00:53:17,540
She's welcome to come on and all that.
But,

1105
00:53:17,570 --> 00:53:19,520
but in an odd way,
maybe that,

1106
00:53:19,521 --> 00:53:21,100
and someone pointed this out to me on 
twitter,

1107
00:53:21,110 --> 00:53:23,290
one of the strange,
odd,

1108
00:53:23,300 --> 00:53:24,890
same voices said,
Dave,

1109
00:53:24,930 --> 00:53:26,640
that was to be the worst thing you could
do.

1110
00:53:26,641 --> 00:53:27,474
Because what you're doing is you're 
encouraging more people to do things 

1111
00:53:30,001 --> 00:53:32,400
like urging people to say crazy things 
about you.

1112
00:53:32,400 --> 00:53:35,880
You then get in a huff puff and you 
gotta defend yourself and now what's the

1113
00:53:35,881 --> 00:53:36,930
next thing?
Now you got to,

1114
00:53:37,110 --> 00:53:39,060
you got to sit and take it on your own 
show,

1115
00:53:39,061 --> 00:53:42,810
which is so completely against the ideas
that you care about.

1116
00:53:42,900 --> 00:53:45,030
Like I don't want my life to be that.
You know what I mean?

1117
00:53:45,031 --> 00:53:46,950
And that's why my left to me that 
either.

1118
00:53:47,040 --> 00:53:47,960
Yeah.
So it's a,

1119
00:53:47,961 --> 00:53:49,740
it's an odd punish.
It is.

1120
00:53:50,450 --> 00:53:51,840
And yet you don't want to just ignore 
it.

1121
00:53:52,050 --> 00:53:56,120
It's against human nature to be attacked
and to just sit down and take.

1122
00:53:56,140 --> 00:53:59,940
That's why we talked before about you 
have to figure out whose voices matter.

1123
00:54:00,020 --> 00:54:01,870
Yeah.
And,

1124
00:54:01,930 --> 00:54:04,800
and I mean I don't know anything about 
this guy,

1125
00:54:05,670 --> 00:54:09,400
but does his voice mattered to you?
I mean is this guy's opinion no hit,

1126
00:54:09,470 --> 00:54:10,303
he's utterly irrelevant to me.
But he wrote a piece in a publication 

1127
00:54:13,230 --> 00:54:16,560
that has saw so,
so the publication has some relevance.

1128
00:54:16,560 --> 00:54:17,640
And by the way,
this guy,

1129
00:54:17,641 --> 00:54:18,474
as I mentioned at the top also,
he was one of 40 people that the 

1130
00:54:21,121 --> 00:54:24,150
Virginia Gop Baseball Games shooter 
followed.

1131
00:54:24,300 --> 00:54:25,133
So we know that that guy was,
was riled up by a lot of the political 

1132
00:54:29,041 --> 00:54:29,874
stuff he was reading.
Cause you could just look at his 

1133
00:54:30,511 --> 00:54:33,570
facebook and all that to see that and 
how much he hated Republicans,

1134
00:54:33,571 --> 00:54:34,404
whatever.
So if you're calling me an extremist 

1135
00:54:36,900 --> 00:54:37,733
there,
there's a cost now that ideas and 

1136
00:54:39,931 --> 00:54:40,764
intentions matter,
which is why I think you can attack the 

1137
00:54:42,961 --> 00:54:45,000
hell out of ideas and you and you not 
can,

1138
00:54:45,001 --> 00:54:46,800
you should,
but there's a need.

1139
00:54:46,801 --> 00:54:50,670
You should be instigating violence and,
and there in lies the rub.

1140
00:54:51,930 --> 00:54:56,510
How do you feel now about all this now 
that it's been a day behind you and him?

1141
00:54:56,550 --> 00:54:57,383
Did you,
do you feel angry when it happened on 

1142
00:54:58,921 --> 00:54:59,220
Friday?

1143
00:54:59,220 --> 00:55:00,150
I was,
I was livid.

1144
00:55:00,151 --> 00:55:02,580
I was in New York City and I was walking
in the middle of Time Square.

1145
00:55:02,581 --> 00:55:04,440
So I'm in Times Square,
the craziest place on earth.

1146
00:55:04,441 --> 00:55:05,101
Like,
you know,

1147
00:55:05,101 --> 00:55:05,934
stimulation via bananas and whatever,
and I'm just flicking off twitter and 

1148
00:55:09,181 --> 00:55:12,120
I'm calling people and like I'm going to
destroy them and everything else.

1149
00:55:12,480 --> 00:55:13,560
And uh,
you know,

1150
00:55:13,561 --> 00:55:14,394
some people said to me,
this is the very definition of libel 

1151
00:55:16,381 --> 00:55:17,214
because it's the mantras really untrue.
He's attacking your income source 

1152
00:55:19,681 --> 00:55:21,840
because of the reference to Patriot on 
all these other things.

1153
00:55:21,960 --> 00:55:23,220
I don't want to sue the guy,
uh,

1154
00:55:23,221 --> 00:55:23,970
by,
by the way,

1155
00:55:23,970 --> 00:55:24,803
I've been on the record as saying I am 
for libel and I'm a free speech 

1156
00:55:26,581 --> 00:55:27,414
absolutist,
but there are laws that we have related 

1157
00:55:29,341 --> 00:55:31,050
to liable.
That's a secondary thing.

1158
00:55:31,380 --> 00:55:32,213
Uh,
but then on,

1159
00:55:32,280 --> 00:55:35,040
on Monday,
uh,

1160
00:55:35,250 --> 00:55:36,083
when it calmed down,
when I got home from New York on Sunday 

1161
00:55:38,880 --> 00:55:39,691
night,
you know this cause you're,

1162
00:55:39,691 --> 00:55:40,770
you're in my house right now.

1163
00:55:40,980 --> 00:55:44,160
I came home and my dog was staggering 
around Emma.

1164
00:55:44,161 --> 00:55:45,960
She's 13.
I love,

1165
00:55:45,961 --> 00:55:46,794
love,
love this dog with every fiber of my 

1166
00:55:48,211 --> 00:55:49,650
being.
She uh,

1167
00:55:49,710 --> 00:55:50,543
she was a rescue from Hurricane Katrina.
I've had her for 11 years and she was 

1168
00:55:54,331 --> 00:55:57,660
staggering and she was having trouble 
standing and she looked confused and her

1169
00:55:57,661 --> 00:56:01,410
eyes are darting around and then I spent
the night and we had to bring her as she

1170
00:56:01,411 --> 00:56:03,300
stayed at the,
at the animal hospital over night.

1171
00:56:03,301 --> 00:56:04,134
We just got her back today and she has 
some issues that we're hopefully going 

1172
00:56:06,691 --> 00:56:07,524
can work on,
but it completely put everything in 

1173
00:56:08,311 --> 00:56:11,640
perspective.
That animal is more important to me than

1174
00:56:11,641 --> 00:56:12,940
this bullshit.
Right.

1175
00:56:13,020 --> 00:56:13,853
Without question.
It doesn't mean I'm not going to get 

1176
00:56:15,061 --> 00:56:17,430
riled up.
But my love of this animal farts,

1177
00:56:18,120 --> 00:56:20,910
what we talked about before about 
relationships in,

1178
00:56:21,140 --> 00:56:23,940
and you have really,
I have two too,

1179
00:56:24,320 --> 00:56:25,153
create a crazy dogs.
But those relationships matter and in 

1180
00:56:29,411 --> 00:56:33,710
that sense they,
they not superseded,

1181
00:56:33,720 --> 00:56:34,553
not override,
but it made you refocus on what 

1182
00:56:35,891 --> 00:56:36,724
mattered.
Like you could be doing all this stuff 

1183
00:56:37,931 --> 00:56:40,510
like that thing and private Ryan,
that scene where the guy's like saying,

1184
00:56:40,511 --> 00:56:41,344
are we going to do this?
We this and he gets a bullet in the 

1185
00:56:42,011 --> 00:56:42,850
head.
You know,

1186
00:56:42,851 --> 00:56:45,280
like now you have a sick animal,
you know,

1187
00:56:45,281 --> 00:56:47,440
like your,
your dog is sick and you love your dog.

1188
00:56:47,800 --> 00:56:49,900
And I dunno,
I guess it's interesting.

1189
00:56:49,901 --> 00:56:50,734
I don't know whether or not having him 
on would be your mistake or not because 

1190
00:56:55,091 --> 00:56:57,710
it would encourage other people to do 
the same thing.

1191
00:56:57,780 --> 00:56:58,613
Yeah.
Well I know it would because it's a 

1192
00:56:59,341 --> 00:57:01,320
feeding frenzy.
We know how these guys operate.

1193
00:57:01,321 --> 00:57:03,720
We've seen this before with many things 
in college.

1194
00:57:03,750 --> 00:57:06,750
Yeah.
What do you think his motivation was?

1195
00:57:06,810 --> 00:57:07,730
I mean,
I know you can't,

1196
00:57:09,090 --> 00:57:12,210
what is the motivation?
Because I believe that it's exactly what

1197
00:57:12,211 --> 00:57:14,970
you're talking about,
that it's this religious,

1198
00:57:15,960 --> 00:57:16,900
uh,
you were it,

1199
00:57:16,910 --> 00:57:18,900
what was the word you use there?
Was this religious,

1200
00:57:19,080 --> 00:57:23,580
quasi religious or moral motivated?
A secular religion.

1201
00:57:23,581 --> 00:57:24,211
Security.
Really?

1202
00:57:24,211 --> 00:57:24,690
Yeah.
Yeah.

1203
00:57:24,690 --> 00:57:27,150
It's this secular religion that they so 
believe.

1204
00:57:27,330 --> 00:57:31,230
So I veered off the path for these guys.
It doesn't matter that I'm gay,

1205
00:57:31,231 --> 00:57:33,030
married,
doesn't matter that I'm pro pot.

1206
00:57:33,270 --> 00:57:34,103
It doesn't matter that I'm pro choice.
It doesn't matter that I'm for 

1207
00:57:36,091 --> 00:57:36,924
euthanasia to check us all the way down.
And one side is religious and this is 

1208
00:57:42,061 --> 00:57:44,700
why I talk about the left more because 
on the right,

1209
00:57:45,090 --> 00:57:47,130
even though they know all of those 
things,

1210
00:57:47,310 --> 00:57:48,930
I still get invited places.

1211
00:57:49,140 --> 00:57:49,973
I get put on prager u videos.
I get invited to college kids that want 

1212
00:57:52,651 --> 00:57:54,780
to talk to me.
They put aside all the different,

1213
00:57:54,781 --> 00:57:56,820
I was at a libertarian,
uh,

1214
00:57:56,850 --> 00:57:58,320
students for liberty thing.
I said,

1215
00:57:58,321 --> 00:58:01,110
I'm for single payer healthcare.
Libertarians don't like that.

1216
00:58:01,260 --> 00:58:02,820
They booed me,
but then laughed.

1217
00:58:02,821 --> 00:58:05,440
We laughed about it and I kind of mock 
them for boomi.

1218
00:58:05,441 --> 00:58:08,250
Guys were the tolerant ones on guys and 
they got it.

1219
00:58:08,880 --> 00:58:09,713
I don't get any invites the other way.
So that's why I think that phrase is so 

1220
00:58:13,081 --> 00:58:15,090
perfect because this is the new 
religion.

1221
00:58:15,120 --> 00:58:15,953
It is the new religion.
Why do you think you don't get msnbc 

1222
00:58:18,751 --> 00:58:20,130
doesn't have you on,
I don't know.

1223
00:58:20,250 --> 00:58:22,470
I can't beg him.
I was on Fox last week.

1224
00:58:22,500 --> 00:58:24,060
Greg Gutfeld,
which I think is a great guy.

1225
00:58:24,061 --> 00:58:26,250
He was going to come on in here really 
doing good stuff.

1226
00:58:26,251 --> 00:58:27,660
We disagree on some stuff.
Okay.

1227
00:58:27,661 --> 00:58:30,090
Big Dam up,
but I can't beg them.

1228
00:58:30,091 --> 00:58:34,110
Why does,
why does Fox put on Ion and MSNBC?

1229
00:58:34,111 --> 00:58:35,130
Does he see that?
I mean,

1230
00:58:35,160 --> 00:58:35,993
they've got such a wonderful question 
that demand that we should demand 

1231
00:58:38,821 --> 00:58:39,654
answers to that.
Did you see last week that the hearings 

1232
00:58:41,820 --> 00:58:43,500
last week a hawk,
what's his name?

1233
00:58:43,501 --> 00:58:45,190
The actor that plays Hulk?
Uh,

1234
00:58:45,690 --> 00:58:47,460
the actor that Plays Hall Company helped
me here.

1235
00:58:49,980 --> 00:58:51,600
Mark refollow.
Oh yeah.

1236
00:58:51,601 --> 00:58:52,381
He said,
the thing about,

1237
00:58:52,381 --> 00:58:53,214
you know,
MSNBC is hiring these white 

1238
00:58:54,270 --> 00:58:55,103
conservatives.
And it's so interesting because he's 

1239
00:58:57,270 --> 00:59:00,350
judging people's political opinions on 
their skin color number one.

1240
00:59:00,351 --> 00:59:02,740
Now he's a white guy who plays a green 
guy so that there's something occurring.

1241
00:59:03,350 --> 00:59:04,141
You know,
you must,

1242
00:59:04,141 --> 00:59:06,690
as a philosophy professor mustard up,
there's gotta be some deep shit there.

1243
00:59:06,900 --> 00:59:07,733
But even putting that aside,
if they started hiring a bunch of black 

1244
00:59:09,990 --> 00:59:10,823
conservatives,
he wouldn't be happy about that either 

1245
00:59:12,061 --> 00:59:15,030
because he would accuse them of being 
uncle toms or something.

1246
00:59:15,210 --> 00:59:17,850
We can party.
It's like Clarence Thomas,

1247
00:59:17,851 --> 00:59:18,684
you know,
we need more Supreme Court justices 

1248
00:59:19,910 --> 00:59:22,160
there a bike too.
Like would you rather have more

1249
00:59:23,450 --> 00:59:24,283
Clarence Thomas is on the Supreme Court 
or would you rather have more white 

1250
00:59:26,571 --> 00:59:27,404
liberals on the Supreme Court?
So what do you think is the antidote to 

1251
00:59:29,031 --> 00:59:29,864
this?
Because I've been trying to push the 

1252
00:59:31,491 --> 00:59:33,830
ideas of classical liberalism.
As you know,

1253
00:59:33,831 --> 00:59:37,490
I believe that the individual is the 
only antidote to this.

1254
00:59:37,491 --> 00:59:40,100
If you relentlessly stand for the 
individual,

1255
00:59:40,101 --> 00:59:42,290
you will always stand for our 
differences.

1256
00:59:42,500 --> 00:59:43,333
You will always be tolerant of our 
differences because you will realize 

1257
00:59:45,831 --> 00:59:46,664
that your different than the next guy.
You won't look at somebody and prejudge 

1258
00:59:50,061 --> 00:59:50,894
them based on color or say I have to 
treat them like are some animal because 

1259
00:59:54,681 --> 00:59:58,820
they have this level of uh,
oppression where the other that,

1260
00:59:58,821 --> 00:59:59,750
okay,
so you put,

1261
00:59:59,780 --> 01:00:00,613
you put your finger on the problem.
So let's talk about the opposite 

1262
01:00:02,780 --> 01:00:04,430
problem.
Intersectionality is the problem.

1263
01:00:04,431 --> 01:00:09,320
We haven't talked about that,
but that there is grievance jockeying.

1264
01:00:09,321 --> 01:00:10,910
Gad said the oppression,
Olympics,

1265
01:00:10,930 --> 01:00:11,763
etc.

1266
01:00:11,810 --> 01:00:12,643
We we need the opposite of Internet 
intersectionality and we need union 

1267
01:00:17,201 --> 01:00:18,034
[inaudible] and there's a line of 
literature called a superordinate 

1268
01:00:21,170 --> 01:00:24,560
identities.
So let's unpack that real quick.

1269
01:00:24,950 --> 01:00:28,190
Have you seen the Heineken commercial?
Yes.

1270
01:00:28,191 --> 01:00:30,080
It's incredible.
It's amazing.

1271
01:00:30,110 --> 01:00:30,943
It's,
it's everything that I've tried to do 

1272
01:00:31,611 --> 01:00:32,320
here.
Okay,

1273
01:00:32,320 --> 01:00:35,150
so that's what we need.
We don't need,

1274
01:00:35,151 --> 01:00:37,850
can you just lay it out real quick for 
you?

1275
01:00:37,870 --> 01:00:38,703
We'll lay out the heineken cholesterol.
They just basically get people together 

1276
01:00:40,641 --> 01:00:41,474
who you'd think have nothing to do with 
each other or should we write political 

1277
01:00:44,121 --> 01:00:44,954
enemies or personal enemies and they sit
down over a drink and do it and they do 

1278
01:00:48,321 --> 01:00:50,020
it well then they,
they,

1279
01:00:50,021 --> 01:00:51,100
they're not sex.
No,

1280
01:00:51,101 --> 01:00:52,700
no.
They do some task,

1281
01:00:52,701 --> 01:00:53,534
right.
There's some hard task and then at the 

1282
01:00:54,861 --> 01:00:56,210
end they say,
do you want to have a beer?

1283
01:00:56,660 --> 01:01:00,530
And they say,
and then they talk as an example of a,

1284
01:01:01,670 --> 01:01:02,503
of,
of a union ality as opposed to 

1285
01:01:04,251 --> 01:01:05,240
intersectionality.

1286
01:01:05,600 --> 01:01:08,960
We're not grieving.
We're not trying to find out who has the

1287
01:01:08,961 --> 01:01:09,794
most strikes against them,
who's the most depressed and then they 

1288
01:01:12,411 --> 01:01:14,540
get the most,
um,

1289
01:01:14,870 --> 01:01:16,850
they get the rights to talk.
The blm,

1290
01:01:17,140 --> 01:01:18,470
uh,
can,

1291
01:01:18,471 --> 01:01:19,304
uh,
over over can talk to the pride Martin 

1292
01:01:21,530 --> 01:01:24,110
March or what have you,
what we need to do is,

1293
01:01:24,111 --> 01:01:24,944
or the shooting in Virginia right now,
we need to appeal to larger identities 

1294
01:01:29,810 --> 01:01:30,643
and we need to coalition build and I see
the left over and over again continuing 

1295
01:01:35,961 --> 01:01:39,530
to dig down in identity politics,
continuing to,

1296
01:01:40,290 --> 01:01:41,123
uh,
use intersectionality to find the most 

1297
01:01:42,771 --> 01:01:43,604
marginalized and oppressed groups and 
then to attempt to change either the 

1298
01:01:46,851 --> 01:01:47,684
nature of words either or,
and the structure of the rule sets and 

1299
01:01:51,371 --> 01:01:54,170
our institutions to privilege these 
folks.

1300
01:01:54,350 --> 01:01:56,090
John Rawls had this whole thing,
salt,

1301
01:01:56,091 --> 01:01:56,924
but I think superordinate identities,
finding identities and things that we 

1302
01:02:00,381 --> 01:02:02,750
have in common and working to build 
coalitions and I,

1303
01:02:02,751 --> 01:02:05,960
and I think if we,
if the left continues to do that,

1304
01:02:05,961 --> 01:02:09,830
we'll either get another four years of 
trump or that other lunatic pants.

1305
01:02:10,280 --> 01:02:10,850
It,
right.

1306
01:02:10,850 --> 01:02:12,670
It's,
we need to build identities.

1307
01:02:12,690 --> 01:02:15,280
It's funny that you describe it that way
because you're,

1308
01:02:15,300 --> 01:02:17,480
you're talking about postmodernism,
you're talking about cultural,

1309
01:02:17,481 --> 01:02:18,530
Marxism,
all this stuff.

1310
01:02:18,830 --> 01:02:20,290
And yet so people will go,
well Pete,

1311
01:02:20,310 --> 01:02:22,140
Pete must be right.
It must be on the right.

1312
01:02:22,170 --> 01:02:23,950
It must be some sort of evil 
conservative or whatever.

1313
01:02:24,210 --> 01:02:26,010
And yet you're not.
No,

1314
01:02:26,080 --> 01:02:27,930
and I do more I think,
by the way,

1315
01:02:27,931 --> 01:02:29,720
I don't want to use conservative.
As I said this chapter,

1316
01:02:29,760 --> 01:02:31,640
I don't want to use it as a pejorative.
I mean,

1317
01:02:31,650 --> 01:02:33,690
so that's the thing I don't feel at 
home.

1318
01:02:33,691 --> 01:02:34,524
I no longer,
and maybe it's cause I'm oddly situated 

1319
01:02:36,811 --> 01:02:37,860
there,
that's another word they love.

1320
01:02:37,861 --> 01:02:40,560
I'm oddly situated in the academy and 
Portland new,

1321
01:02:40,561 --> 01:02:45,561
which is very left to center anyway.
Even though the overwhelming majority of

1322
01:02:46,051 --> 01:02:50,490
my beliefs I would call self identify as
a classical liberal.

1323
01:02:51,330 --> 01:02:52,163
I no longer feel at home with anything 
to do with things that are even broadly 

1324
01:02:57,331 --> 01:02:59,370
the left.
And you and other people have called for

1325
01:02:59,371 --> 01:03:01,710
the new center.
I think that might be what we need.

1326
01:03:01,711 --> 01:03:03,510
I certainly don't feel at home in the 
right.

1327
01:03:03,540 --> 01:03:04,373
And again,
in terms of that checklist of beliefs 

1328
01:03:05,611 --> 01:03:06,444
they have.
So I feel that I'm efficient cause I 

1329
01:03:08,861 --> 01:03:12,330
kind of feel like when I lived in 
Albuquerque I feel that I'm wandering,

1330
01:03:12,390 --> 01:03:13,860
not wondering.
I feel that I've,

1331
01:03:14,160 --> 01:03:17,730
I don't have a home and I don't feel 
comfortable anywhere,

1332
01:03:17,731 --> 01:03:18,564
but one of the consequences of not 
feeling comfortable is when you meet 

1333
01:03:21,091 --> 01:03:26,091
people who share those beliefs,
you have a kind of ideological kinship.

1334
01:03:27,210 --> 01:03:30,030
You have a kind of,
wow,

1335
01:03:30,031 --> 01:03:32,010
we're really on the out chair right 
there.

1336
01:03:32,011 --> 01:03:33,930
We're,
we're really trying to figure this out.

1337
01:03:33,931 --> 01:03:38,160
We're really trying to make some,
we try to live a good life.

1338
01:03:38,161 --> 01:03:38,994
We're trying to be decent.
People were trying to make decisions on 

1339
01:03:40,381 --> 01:03:42,990
the base of evidence and yeah,
we changed our minds and,

1340
01:03:43,920 --> 01:03:47,070
but we're not at home and the right,
we're not at home on the left were being

1341
01:03:47,071 --> 01:03:49,680
excoriated on the,
on the left for calling out,

1342
01:03:50,040 --> 01:03:52,440
never make calling out somebody 
bullshit,

1343
01:03:53,790 --> 01:03:54,720
a right wing thing.

1344
01:03:55,280 --> 01:03:57,170
The moment you've done that,
you're,

1345
01:03:57,230 --> 01:03:58,100
you're,
you're,

1346
01:03:58,190 --> 01:04:00,350
you've become a farce,
a caricature of yourself.

1347
01:04:00,351 --> 01:04:01,101
It's a farce.
You know,

1348
01:04:01,101 --> 01:04:01,934
it's so interesting you've hit on so 
many things because I love what we're 

1349
01:04:03,711 --> 01:04:04,544
doing here because it's,
we're talking about the sort of these 

1350
01:04:05,511 --> 01:04:06,344
broad issues,
but then also how they are directly 

1351
01:04:07,551 --> 01:04:11,120
related to us as people and that's what 
I think really matters.

1352
01:04:11,450 --> 01:04:12,430
And even,
you know,

1353
01:04:12,470 --> 01:04:15,140
just a week ago or so,
and I think it was in Philadelphia,

1354
01:04:15,350 --> 01:04:18,110
they unveiled their new gay pride 
rainbow flag,

1355
01:04:18,111 --> 01:04:21,750
but now it has a black and brown color 
bar,

1356
01:04:21,780 --> 01:04:24,380
you know,
to new color bars to represent people of

1357
01:04:24,381 --> 01:04:27,380
color.
And this is the height of absurdity.

1358
01:04:27,381 --> 01:04:29,990
The rainbow flag represented all gay 
people,

1359
01:04:30,230 --> 01:04:32,320
White Gay people,
Asian Gay people,

1360
01:04:32,340 --> 01:04:34,310
Muslim gay people,
the Jewish gay people,

1361
01:04:34,311 --> 01:04:35,144
et Cetera,
et cetera.

1362
01:04:35,210 --> 01:04:39,080
There was no racial connotation to it.
And the gay community,

1363
01:04:39,260 --> 01:04:41,960
at least from what I can tell,
this is pretty good on,

1364
01:04:42,010 --> 01:04:42,843
on most race issues you see more couples
I think that are racially different or 

1365
01:04:46,641 --> 01:04:47,474
diverse or all that stuff.
But now because they had to bow to 

1366
01:04:50,691 --> 01:04:51,524
whatever that,
I don't know if it was directly related 

1367
01:04:52,491 --> 01:04:55,040
to black lives matter or whatever,
but because they had to bow to them,

1368
01:04:55,041 --> 01:04:55,874
they've literally ruined the rainbow.
The rainbow is we know what the rainbow 

1369
01:04:59,421 --> 01:05:00,254
is now they're telling us the rainbow is
inherently part of the patriarchy or 

1370
01:05:02,931 --> 01:05:03,560
you're a racist.

1371
01:05:03,560 --> 01:05:05,560
There anything,
I didn't end up but,

1372
01:05:05,770 --> 01:05:06,690
but here's the personal part.

1373
01:05:07,220 --> 01:05:08,053
So I thought all of this,
obviously I don't think I'm blowing 

1374
01:05:09,111 --> 01:05:11,060
anyone's mind when I say this.
They understand what I think.

1375
01:05:11,390 --> 01:05:12,223
But I didn't even want to tweet about it
cause I didn't even feel like getting 

1376
01:05:14,361 --> 01:05:15,194
involved on this one.
It's like I got to pick my battles and 

1377
01:05:17,351 --> 01:05:18,010
if I was gonna say,
well,

1378
01:05:18,010 --> 01:05:18,843
someone's using you're racist.
You don't want a black bar and a brown 

1379
01:05:21,821 --> 01:05:22,654
bar on that.
But my point would be there was no 

1380
01:05:24,461 --> 01:05:25,294
racial kind of tissue.
You're now making it racist and guess 

1381
01:05:27,611 --> 01:05:28,444
what?
Somebody's years from now he's going to 

1382
01:05:29,951 --> 01:05:30,784
have some other thing that they want to 
put on there and they're going to have 

1383
01:05:31,981 --> 01:05:33,490
to make sure they're more oppressive 
than you.

1384
01:05:33,790 --> 01:05:36,100
And this is the endless snake eating 
itself.

1385
01:05:37,680 --> 01:05:40,240
Something just within that,
you know,

1386
01:05:40,330 --> 01:05:41,163
I'm taking about emily being sick.
I think that's one of the things that 

1387
01:05:44,021 --> 01:05:46,120
people don't see when they attack you.

1388
01:05:46,540 --> 01:05:48,730
I think that's one of the things that 
people don't like.

1389
01:05:48,780 --> 01:05:52,360
You're just a guy living in your life.
You've got a dog,

1390
01:05:52,390 --> 01:05:54,400
you've got a husband you're trying to 
make through the day,

1391
01:05:54,401 --> 01:05:55,234
like everybody else.
And I think people need to take a step 

1392
01:05:57,851 --> 01:06:02,851
back and realize that we're actually 
people like Dave Rubin is a guy and he's

1393
01:06:02,951 --> 01:06:06,520
a good guy and he likes Heineken or,
you know what I'm saying?

1394
01:06:06,640 --> 01:06:07,960
Yeah,
I'm a Ford Guy.

1395
01:06:08,790 --> 01:06:10,090
More footwear,
we're flawed people.

1396
01:06:10,091 --> 01:06:12,670
And if you have a a problem with 
somebody,

1397
01:06:13,090 --> 01:06:17,290
it's much better.
And it's not necessarily the tone of the

1398
01:06:17,291 --> 01:06:19,320
criticism.
Uh,

1399
01:06:19,390 --> 01:06:20,240
and I,
you know,

1400
01:06:20,260 --> 01:06:21,460
I feel,
I feel weird saying,

1401
01:06:21,461 --> 01:06:22,500
well,
I to start doing attack,

1402
01:06:22,510 --> 01:06:23,390
Dave Rubin,
what?

1403
01:06:23,690 --> 01:06:25,120
I don't think,
you're not saying don't attack me.

1404
01:06:25,190 --> 01:06:27,400
I want to do whatever they want to do 
anyway.

1405
01:06:27,700 --> 01:06:28,533
But I think that you would get more 
mileage and more attention if those 

1406
01:06:32,381 --> 01:06:35,770
criticisms were devoid of personal 
attacks.

1407
01:06:36,220 --> 01:06:38,020
And you said,
Reuben said this,

1408
01:06:38,021 --> 01:06:40,150
this is why I think it's wrong and you 
lay it out.

1409
01:06:40,180 --> 01:06:41,013
Well,
that's what I said before when people 

1410
01:06:41,741 --> 01:06:42,650
would attack me and said,
well,

1411
01:06:42,970 --> 01:06:44,200
Dave,
you didn't ask this question.

1412
01:06:44,201 --> 01:06:46,270
Are you asked the question the wrong way
or you you,

1413
01:06:46,300 --> 01:06:49,420
you know my policy on interviewing as I 
like to give rope to let people,

1414
01:06:49,590 --> 01:06:50,423
hey look,
I just asked you a lot of really broad 

1415
01:06:51,671 --> 01:06:52,504
questions.
If you didn't know where you were 

1416
01:06:53,291 --> 01:06:54,760
talking about,
you would have hung yourself.

1417
01:06:54,780 --> 01:06:56,500
I in this instance,
I don't think you did,

1418
01:06:56,740 --> 01:06:58,970
but I've had guests that I think do,
but those I,

1419
01:06:59,000 --> 01:07:02,450
those are criticisms I'm more than happy
to address and I,

1420
01:07:02,451 --> 01:07:05,620
I hope that five years from now I'm so 
much of a better interviewer that I look

1421
01:07:05,621 --> 01:07:08,620
back on this and think this is shit.
I want to be better.

1422
01:07:08,620 --> 01:07:09,730
I want to be that.
But if you're,

1423
01:07:09,880 --> 01:07:13,120
if you're going a jumping off point is 
this guy's a right wing extremist,

1424
01:07:13,630 --> 01:07:15,160
well then we're,
we're not going to really do this,

1425
01:07:15,161 --> 01:07:18,310
but I think what we've done here for the
hour is pretty good.

1426
01:07:18,340 --> 01:07:19,770
We're going to wrap this thing cause 
we're,

1427
01:07:19,771 --> 01:07:21,430
we're going to dinner with some friends 
cause we don't,

1428
01:07:21,431 --> 01:07:23,500
we didn't make up this friendship thing 
were no,

1429
01:07:23,501 --> 01:07:24,420
it's a legitimate,
no,

1430
01:07:24,421 --> 01:07:27,510
it wasn't an artifact of a say.
Yeah.

1431
01:07:27,550 --> 01:07:30,300
You want to get drunk or what?
Probably yeah,

1432
01:07:30,340 --> 01:07:32,110
probably.
I'm only supposed cause my diamond a low

1433
01:07:32,111 --> 01:07:32,944
sugar diet is interesting.
So I'm only supposed to drink Pinot 

1434
01:07:35,951 --> 01:07:39,490
grigio now.
So I've been drinking a ton of that.

1435
01:07:39,491 --> 01:07:40,270
So,
uh,

1436
01:07:40,270 --> 01:07:42,100
I think that's our,
I like the red,

1437
01:07:42,101 --> 01:07:47,101
but it was a pleasure as always.
And we have to do these more than once a

1438
01:07:47,621 --> 01:07:50,380
year because I think it's a good,
it's a good catch up and it's a good,

1439
01:07:50,381 --> 01:07:51,580
uh,
I have no problem.

1440
01:07:51,580 --> 01:07:54,070
You grading whether I've moved forward 
or or,

1441
01:07:54,460 --> 01:07:57,370
or breast or whatever.
I think it would be a fun thing.

1442
01:07:57,420 --> 01:07:57,850
Yeah.
And,

1443
01:07:57,850 --> 01:08:01,510
and who knows where our ideas are going 
to go.

1444
01:08:01,511 --> 01:08:02,344
Who knows how our beliefs will change 
when we're confronted button new 

1445
01:08:04,611 --> 01:08:06,010
evidence.
But here's what we do know.

1446
01:08:06,490 --> 01:08:07,323
If either one of us thinks that we've 
gone off the rails or that we've made a 

1447
01:08:09,851 --> 01:08:10,684
mistake,
we're going to call it out to the other 

1448
01:08:11,591 --> 01:08:14,410
one and we're going to do so in the 
context of a friendship.

1449
01:08:15,320 --> 01:08:18,160
Well said for more on Peter Boghossian 
orb,

1450
01:08:18,330 --> 01:08:19,970
and he doesn't mind which way you say 
it.

1451
01:08:20,180 --> 01:08:21,013
A follow him on the twitter,
although he may not check as mentioned 

1452
01:08:22,641 --> 01:08:24,320
to that much at Peterborough.
