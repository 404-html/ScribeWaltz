1
00:00:02,540 --> 00:00:05,490
I'm going to be sitting down with Tommy 
Robinson this week to say,

2
00:00:05,491 --> 00:00:07,170
Tommy,
he's a controversial figure,

3
00:00:07,171 --> 00:00:08,004
would be putting it mildly.
You only have to glance it is twitter 

4
00:00:10,021 --> 00:00:10,854
mentions to see how some see him as a 
modern day hero defending Western 

5
00:00:14,551 --> 00:00:17,580
society while others see him as a racist
thug.

6
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:18,773
Thankfully I don't get all my 
information from twitter and neither 

7
00:00:20,971 --> 00:00:21,804
should you.
Tommy is the cofounder of the English 

8
00:00:24,750 --> 00:00:26,620
Defense League,
a movement that opposes Islam,

9
00:00:26,621 --> 00:00:27,454
Islam and Sharia law in the UK.
He left the edl a few years ago after 

10
00:00:31,081 --> 00:00:31,914
connecting with my [inaudible] is 
Quilliam Foundation because he felt the 

11
00:00:34,951 --> 00:00:37,620
edl had become too extreme.
Now,

12
00:00:37,621 --> 00:00:38,454
Tommy is part of Paquita UK,
a subset of the bigger European paquita 

13
00:00:42,481 --> 00:00:43,314
movement,
which has the stated goal of preventing 

14
00:00:45,990 --> 00:00:49,260
the Islamification of our countries.
Basically,

15
00:00:49,261 --> 00:00:50,094
Tommy thinks that the UK and now all of 
Europe are in route to becoming Islamic 

16
00:00:53,911 --> 00:00:55,270
nations.
Time.

17
00:00:55,430 --> 00:00:56,263
He reached out to me about two months 
ago to see about being a guest on the 

18
00:00:58,621 --> 00:00:59,454
show before I said yes,
I actually had to do a bit of soul 

19
00:01:01,801 --> 00:01:02,370
searching.

20
00:01:02,370 --> 00:01:03,203
As you guys know,
I'm beyond fed up with the regressive 

21
00:01:05,281 --> 00:01:08,370
left's labeling of everyone a bigot or a
racist,

22
00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:09,443
but in Tommy's case,
are they actually right and if the 

23
00:01:12,091 --> 00:01:12,924
regressives are,
why should I even talk to someone with 

24
00:01:15,211 --> 00:01:17,400
racist views?
There's no doubt.

25
00:01:17,401 --> 00:01:20,640
Tommy spends most of his time talking 
about the dangers of Islam.

26
00:01:20,641 --> 00:01:21,474
He certainly isn't hiding that,
but are his motives actually based in 

27
00:01:24,391 --> 00:01:25,224
bigotry?
It wasn't just those questions that had 

28
00:01:27,541 --> 00:01:28,374
me unsure whether to talk to him though 
there was actually something else at 

29
00:01:31,681 --> 00:01:36,180
work and something that really exposes 
the rot that the regressives are causing

30
00:01:36,181 --> 00:01:39,450
in our society.
Part of me was actually afraid that if I

31
00:01:39,451 --> 00:01:40,284
spoke to Tommy,
regardless of whether he really is a 

32
00:01:42,271 --> 00:01:45,600
bigot or not,
that I also would be labeled a bigot.

33
00:01:46,110 --> 00:01:46,943
Let me repeat that.
I feared that just by having a 

34
00:01:48,811 --> 00:01:53,250
conversation with someone just by 
hearing their views on this show as I do

35
00:01:53,251 --> 00:01:56,640
every week,
that I would then get one of those awful

36
00:01:56,641 --> 00:01:59,430
labels that people throw around thrown 
on me.

37
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:01,140
After a couple of days of thinking about
it,

38
00:02:01,141 --> 00:02:04,410
I realized that not only did I have to 
do the interview with Tommy,

39
00:02:04,411 --> 00:02:08,070
but my fear was the exact reason that I 
had to do it.

40
00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:09,173
The chilling effect that words like 
bigoted and racist have are not just on 

41
00:02:12,421 --> 00:02:13,254
the person and who they are aimed,
but they're also used to stop other 

42
00:02:15,991 --> 00:02:19,140
people from talking to them.
The less we talk,

43
00:02:19,141 --> 00:02:22,410
the more the authoritarians can move in 
with easy answers.

44
00:02:22,650 --> 00:02:24,810
Once I really wrapped myself around 
that,

45
00:02:24,811 --> 00:02:25,644
it was a no brainer like all my guests,
all at Tommy's ideas be heard and you 

46
00:02:29,701 --> 00:02:32,430
the audience will be the judge.
Ironically,

47
00:02:32,431 --> 00:02:35,370
if the left had been more honest about 
the dangers of Islam,

48
00:02:35,371 --> 00:02:36,204
Islam all along,
I would feel less of a need to have 

49
00:02:38,341 --> 00:02:41,130
conversations like this,
but they refuse to.

50
00:02:41,131 --> 00:02:44,190
So here we are.
If his ideas are good,

51
00:02:44,220 --> 00:02:45,240
then let them spread.

52
00:02:45,420 --> 00:02:48,180
If they aren't,
then let them be beat by better ideas.

53
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:49,133
As my former guests,
Douglas Murray said on Sam Harris' 

54
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:51,833
podcast a few weeks ago,
it's too late to be willing to be 

55
00:02:54,511 --> 00:02:55,344
blackmailed by people who are 
fundamentally insincere in their 

56
00:02:58,051 --> 00:02:58,884
insults.
That's exactly how I feel about labels 

57
00:03:01,331 --> 00:03:02,164
or pretty much any of the other nonsense
coming from people who would rather 

58
00:03:05,801 --> 00:03:08,280
stifled debate than have it.
This past weekend.

59
00:03:08,290 --> 00:03:10,180
I rewatched one of my all time favorite 
movies,

60
00:03:10,181 --> 00:03:13,180
v for Vendetta and powerful speech to 
London.

61
00:03:13,181 --> 00:03:14,014
He says,
and where once you had the freedom to 

62
00:03:15,641 --> 00:03:18,820
object to think and speak as you saw 
fit,

63
00:03:19,090 --> 00:03:19,923
you now have sensors and systems of 
surveillance coercing you're conformity 

64
00:03:23,470 --> 00:03:26,380
and soliciting your submission.
How did this happen?

65
00:03:26,381 --> 00:03:27,850
Who's to blame?
Well,

66
00:03:27,851 --> 00:03:31,060
certainly there are those more 
responsible than others and they will be

67
00:03:31,061 --> 00:03:32,890
held accountable,
but again,

68
00:03:32,891 --> 00:03:35,500
truth be told,
if you're looking for the guilty,

69
00:03:35,740 --> 00:03:36,573
you need only look in the mirror.
I think it's getting high time that we 

70
00:03:39,251 --> 00:03:41,530
all look in the mirror and decide what 
we believe.

71
00:03:44,450 --> 00:03:46,790
My guest this week is an author,
activist,

72
00:03:46,791 --> 00:03:47,624
and former leader of the English defense
league is also no stranger to 

73
00:03:50,871 --> 00:03:52,580
controversy.
Tommy Robinson,

74
00:03:52,581 --> 00:03:53,414
welcome to the show.

75
00:03:54,060 --> 00:03:54,893
Thank you.

76
00:03:55,330 --> 00:03:57,910
All right man,
so I want to start with this,

77
00:03:57,911 --> 00:03:58,744
which is what I lead the show off with,
which is that I struggled with the 

78
00:04:02,561 --> 00:04:03,394
decision to even have you on the show 
because I see what people say about you 

79
00:04:08,470 --> 00:04:09,303
and half of it is this guy is going to 
save the Western world and then half of 

80
00:04:14,231 --> 00:04:18,640
it is he's a bigot.
He's a racist and plenty other stuff,

81
00:04:18,670 --> 00:04:19,840
uh,
in line with that.

82
00:04:20,140 --> 00:04:23,620
So first off,
do you get that often?

83
00:04:23,621 --> 00:04:27,880
Do you get that people are sometimes 
afraid to talk to you?

84
00:04:28,630 --> 00:04:29,790
Um,
yes.

85
00:04:29,850 --> 00:04:30,683
And there's a reason for that.
You will be targeted as high as anyone 

86
00:04:34,081 --> 00:04:35,880
else that speaks to me.
Oh Great.

87
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:38,790
By a campaign,
you will trust me.

88
00:04:38,791 --> 00:04:39,624
You will.
I've just been asked last night it was 

89
00:04:42,091 --> 00:04:44,280
released on ongoing to be addressing 
this,

90
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:49,380
the Hindu leadership of the UK.
I've been invited to an event to discuss

91
00:04:49,410 --> 00:04:53,160
multiculturalism.
They've been targeted,

92
00:04:53,220 --> 00:04:56,550
they're getting attacked now.
I expect that when I turn up,

93
00:04:56,850 --> 00:04:59,670
if they're not forced or pressurized 
into canceling,

94
00:05:00,030 --> 00:05:03,420
which is what's happened with university
after university,

95
00:05:03,510 --> 00:05:07,230
after university with schools,
anyone that asked me to speak,

96
00:05:07,950 --> 00:05:12,450
even tv shows in the UK,
there's a conservative effort to silence

97
00:05:12,451 --> 00:05:16,680
what I'm saying and to attack anyone 
that gives me a platform to say it.

98
00:05:16,830 --> 00:05:17,341
Yeah.
Well,

99
00:05:17,341 --> 00:05:18,174
as I mentioned that the top,
that was really what my deciding factor 

100
00:05:20,851 --> 00:05:21,684
was to talk to you because I'm so sick 
of everyone being labeled bigoted and 

101
00:05:26,431 --> 00:05:27,264
racist and all that.
That if I'm afraid to talk to you then 

102
00:05:29,911 --> 00:05:33,390
that that is almost a bigger problem 
than bigotry and racism,

103
00:05:33,660 --> 00:05:36,150
so that's why we have to do this,
I think.

104
00:05:36,820 --> 00:05:37,653
Yeah.
You're,

105
00:05:37,780 --> 00:05:39,870
you're in a minority that I so thank 
you.

106
00:05:40,770 --> 00:05:41,603
All right.
Well,

107
00:05:42,310 --> 00:05:43,143
most people put their reputations or 
their careers or what things are that 

108
00:05:47,021 --> 00:05:49,270
before free speech in the UK.

109
00:05:49,610 --> 00:05:50,151
Yeah.
Well,

110
00:05:50,151 --> 00:05:50,984
somehow I still have this belief that if
I talk about free speech that it'll 

111
00:05:54,530 --> 00:05:57,110
actually be good for my career.
We shall,

112
00:05:57,620 --> 00:05:58,940
but why?
Why don't we start with this?

113
00:05:58,941 --> 00:06:01,670
Let's just start with the most obvious 
piece of meat.

114
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,640
Are you bigoted against Muslims?

115
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:09,190
Go to separate Muslims.
Whenever I,

116
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:10,273
whenever I speak,
I try to set up separate Muslims from 

117
00:06:12,051 --> 00:06:12,884
Islam.
I have an opinion on Islam in the same 

118
00:06:15,291 --> 00:06:19,390
way Islam has an opinion on me.
Islam is bigoted towards Muslims.

119
00:06:19,700 --> 00:06:21,350
I'm not every Muslim,
of course,

120
00:06:21,351 --> 00:06:22,840
every,
every Muslim is not bigoted.

121
00:06:23,070 --> 00:06:24,540
Um,
if you,

122
00:06:24,650 --> 00:06:25,483
if you've read my book that some of the 
best meet people I've met in my life 

123
00:06:28,011 --> 00:06:31,830
growing up on Muslims,
I don't have a problem with Muslim,

124
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:34,760
but I do have a problem with the way 
Islam is influencing my country.

125
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:37,550
I have a problem with the hatred that is
incited from it.

126
00:06:37,870 --> 00:06:38,703
And um,
and we're fearful of what the future 

127
00:06:40,911 --> 00:06:41,560
holds.

128
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:42,880
Right?
So just to be clear,

129
00:06:42,881 --> 00:06:45,400
and this is what I've spent a lot of the
time on the show talking about.

130
00:06:45,700 --> 00:06:48,760
You're making a distinction between 
Islam,

131
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:53,260
meaning the doctrine,
the set of ideas that are in books,

132
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:54,413
a between that and between the people 
that may or may not be using these 

133
00:06:59,711 --> 00:07:00,790
ideas.
And as you said,

134
00:07:00,791 --> 00:07:01,624
you've met plenty of Muslim people that 
you liked a lot and you're making that 

135
00:07:03,341 --> 00:07:04,110
distinction.

136
00:07:04,110 --> 00:07:06,510
I'll make that distinction in a similar 
way to the fact that,

137
00:07:06,511 --> 00:07:09,120
look,
if I was a critic of Scientology,

138
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:13,020
I would not be getting called a racist.
I would not be getting called any of the

139
00:07:13,021 --> 00:07:13,854
things that I am just because it happens
that the majority of Muslims are not 

140
00:07:17,941 --> 00:07:18,774
white on,
beaten down and attacked with this 

141
00:07:20,791 --> 00:07:21,624
racist stick.
Which is ridiculous because Islam is an 

142
00:07:23,911 --> 00:07:24,744
idea.
It's an idea that should be criticize 

143
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:29,300
and it's my God given right to criticize
it.

144
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:32,790
I don't incite hate against any 
individual Muslims.

145
00:07:32,970 --> 00:07:33,803
I've never ever there.
I let the English Defense League for 

146
00:07:36,001 --> 00:07:37,660
over six years.
Um,

147
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:40,950
I've never been done for any racism,
any extremism,

148
00:07:41,470 --> 00:07:44,280
any insightful speeches.
In fact,

149
00:07:44,281 --> 00:07:48,270
if people at the height of leading the 
English Defense League when there was,

150
00:07:48,271 --> 00:07:49,890
um,
when our soldier leaving,

151
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:53,670
he was beheaded in the streets of London
are very next demonstration.

152
00:07:54,060 --> 00:07:54,893
I started my speech off by saying that 
there are 600 Muslims who served in the 

153
00:07:57,840 --> 00:07:58,673
British armed forces that if you attack 
a Muslim woman or you get spare Muslim 

154
00:08:02,881 --> 00:08:03,240
woman,
you're.

155
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:04,073
You're an absolute coward and I tried to
get the distinction between some things 

156
00:08:07,261 --> 00:08:08,094
are morally just and I think my campaign
is morally just and righteous and other 

157
00:08:11,701 --> 00:08:14,610
things,
a cowardly attack in houses of worship,

158
00:08:14,611 --> 00:08:17,160
whether they be Christian or Muslim is 
cowardly.

159
00:08:17,460 --> 00:08:20,340
So from.
I've done that from day one.

160
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:24,180
In fact,
as far as the organization goes,

161
00:08:24,181 --> 00:08:25,770
we've been a moderate voice in this in 
this,

162
00:08:25,771 --> 00:08:26,604
but we can put completely attacked as 
extremists or hateful and insight and 

163
00:08:29,761 --> 00:08:32,890
hate.
Literally just this week I've gone where

164
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,160
we're having a demonstration in the city
of Birmingham,

165
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:38,170
which is Britain's second biggest city,
has it,

166
00:08:38,350 --> 00:08:40,590
has a large Muslim population that has a
lot of problems there.

167
00:08:41,100 --> 00:08:43,300
And I met a Muslim counselor and this is
the.

168
00:08:43,350 --> 00:08:45,690
This is where the problem comes in.
And I said to him,

169
00:08:46,050 --> 00:08:50,070
if an organization is completely 
peaceful and there's no violence,

170
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:50,993
there's no alcohol.
Do they have a right to come to this 

171
00:08:53,191 --> 00:08:55,950
city?
And criticized as well,

172
00:08:56,640 --> 00:09:00,000
and he said no,
and that's where we're at.

173
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:01,231
And I said,
why not?

174
00:09:01,231 --> 00:09:03,270
He said,
because criticizing Islam insights.

175
00:09:03,271 --> 00:09:04,650
Hey,
I said,

176
00:09:04,740 --> 00:09:07,350
telling the truth can't incite hey,
and,

177
00:09:07,430 --> 00:09:09,960
and that's where we've been beaten down 
so much because so many.

178
00:09:10,020 --> 00:09:12,270
And He,
he's a counselor for the Labor Party,

179
00:09:12,420 --> 00:09:13,253
which is a mainstream political party.
So many people are against free speech 

180
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:17,430
when it comes to Islam.

181
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:19,310
Yeah.
Well as my audience knows,

182
00:09:19,311 --> 00:09:21,440
I mean this is really where the left has
failed.

183
00:09:21,441 --> 00:09:22,274
And from everything that I'm hearing 
from my friends in the UK and across 

184
00:09:24,441 --> 00:09:27,020
most of Europe,
sadly most of western Europe,

185
00:09:27,220 --> 00:09:29,620
the left is failing everywhere.
Uh,

186
00:09:29,730 --> 00:09:32,840
and the more that the voices of Liberals
are silenced,

187
00:09:32,841 --> 00:09:35,780
the more that the far right is going to 
be strengthened.

188
00:09:36,060 --> 00:09:36,893
A,
you're probably somewhat of an example 

189
00:09:37,941 --> 00:09:38,774
of that.
So before we get into all the specifics 

190
00:09:40,431 --> 00:09:41,264
and everything that's going on today,
can you just tell me a little bit of 

191
00:09:43,521 --> 00:09:47,030
your history growing up when you became 
politically active?

192
00:09:47,330 --> 00:09:48,163
That kind of stuff.

193
00:09:48,410 --> 00:09:51,670
So I grew up in a town called Luton.
Um,

194
00:09:51,910 --> 00:09:56,910
so one of the most multicultural towns 
in Europe when I was born in 1982,

195
00:09:57,271 --> 00:10:01,230
there was one mosque.
Now there's an excess of 30.

196
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:03,870
We have approximately 50,000
Muslims.

197
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:08,520
We've had just last week for Muslims 
from my hometown.

198
00:10:08,521 --> 00:10:10,130
One which went,
went to my school,

199
00:10:10,131 --> 00:10:12,810
had been charged with terrorism,
another young,

200
00:10:12,870 --> 00:10:16,260
another Muslim who was a white convert.
Just again this,

201
00:10:16,290 --> 00:10:20,400
this week has been charged with insight 
and support for Isis.

202
00:10:21,090 --> 00:10:24,810
My hometown was the launch pad for the 
seven seven attack on London.

203
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:27,930
London's underground,
the fertilizer bomb plot.

204
00:10:28,260 --> 00:10:29,850
Um,
the stock counting bomber.

205
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:31,760
Some of you may remember the stock 
bomber.

206
00:10:31,950 --> 00:10:34,970
He was radicalized in my hometown.
He lived two doors away from my army.

207
00:10:35,580 --> 00:10:40,580
So Amazon Redeem Omar,
Omar Bakri Abu Hamza with the hook,

208
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:45,090
their head office and their 
organizations base was in my town.

209
00:10:45,450 --> 00:10:47,340
So I,
what's going on in their town?

210
00:10:48,150 --> 00:10:50,030
What's going on in that sound is,
um,

211
00:10:50,220 --> 00:10:52,820
we've had,
it's been the epicenter and the,

212
00:10:52,870 --> 00:10:53,703
and the home of radical Islam.
And there'd been allowed with 

213
00:10:57,270 --> 00:11:01,950
unchallenged by councils or government 
or police for 30 years to plan,

214
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:04,560
orchestrate,
and radicalize an entire community.

215
00:11:05,010 --> 00:11:05,843
And we've filled in my hometown after 
September the 11th in America when I 

216
00:11:10,201 --> 00:11:11,034
come out to my shops the next week,
we had magnificent noname posters 

217
00:11:14,971 --> 00:11:18,630
everywhere.
We had posters glorifying the 19 suicide

218
00:11:18,631 --> 00:11:19,840
bombers.
Um,

219
00:11:19,980 --> 00:11:23,910
the in the local college.
They celebrate it every year after that,

220
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:24,953
outside in our town center,
there was a celebration parade for the 

221
00:11:27,451 --> 00:11:28,360
Muslims who,
who,

222
00:11:28,370 --> 00:11:31,050
who murdered on September 11th.
That's where I live.

223
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:33,440
So I've grown up from a very young age 
and I have,

224
00:11:33,750 --> 00:11:36,690
I have many of these,
what we call liberals in the UK,

225
00:11:36,691 --> 00:11:41,010
they're not really liberals,
but or those on the left who condemn me,

226
00:11:41,460 --> 00:11:42,990
they shout at me that they.

227
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:45,120
And they know nothing about the life 
I've lived.

228
00:11:45,260 --> 00:11:45,850
I think,
oh,

229
00:11:45,850 --> 00:11:48,270
to the life I've lived that have not 
seen what we've seen.

230
00:11:48,510 --> 00:11:49,343
They don't live with the effects.
And when we talk about multiculturalism 

231
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:55,870
in the UK,
we have our political leaders.

232
00:11:55,871 --> 00:11:58,480
David Cameron has come out and said,
multiculturalism has failed.

233
00:11:58,780 --> 00:12:01,360
Angela Merkel said years ago,
multiculturalism has failed.

234
00:12:01,750 --> 00:12:04,660
What they're actually saying,
what they're actually saying.

235
00:12:04,661 --> 00:12:09,160
This Islams failed because in my 
hometown and my group of friends,

236
00:12:09,670 --> 00:12:12,880
the majority of them come from immigrant
backgrounds,

237
00:12:12,881 --> 00:12:14,920
whether it be Saint Lucian,
Italian,

238
00:12:14,950 --> 00:12:16,480
Bulgarian,
Jamaican,

239
00:12:16,660 --> 00:12:18,670
Indian,
and everyone gets on fine.

240
00:12:19,180 --> 00:12:21,550
And that,
and my town has been divided,

241
00:12:21,551 --> 00:12:24,220
not through,
not through racial lines ever.

242
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:27,550
We don't have the racial problem.
I don't know if you believe you may have

243
00:12:27,551 --> 00:12:28,384
in the US,
but we don't have a racial problem that 

244
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:30,993
we have a religious tensions and the 
religious line drawn through the 

245
00:12:33,821 --> 00:12:34,654
communities.

246
00:12:34,790 --> 00:12:38,300
Right.
So when you saw this growing up,

247
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:39,640
uh,
you know,

248
00:12:39,650 --> 00:12:41,000
you're not,
you're not that old,

249
00:12:41,001 --> 00:12:42,290
right?
You're in your mid thirties.

250
00:12:42,770 --> 00:12:46,040
When did your sort of awakening a 
appear?

251
00:12:46,041 --> 00:12:46,910
When did you say,
okay,

252
00:12:46,911 --> 00:12:50,000
this is something that I'd have to talk 
about and attach myself to?

253
00:12:50,650 --> 00:12:51,290
So my,
my,

254
00:12:51,290 --> 00:12:52,620
my awakening was,
um,

255
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:57,560
the Beslan school massacre 2000 and 
2004,

256
00:12:57,561 --> 00:12:58,394
I believe it was.
What it was was that I'd watch this 

257
00:13:00,981 --> 00:13:01,880
group,
this group,

258
00:13:01,881 --> 00:13:02,714
how measure dean,
I'd watch them grow and and when I say 

259
00:13:04,550 --> 00:13:05,383
watch them,
one of the man who's convicted this 

260
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:08,473
week,
who was an ex member of their 

261
00:13:08,751 --> 00:13:09,584
organization,
a white ginger convert would ebe room 

262
00:13:11,590 --> 00:13:13,060
Hansen,
his name is Roger.

263
00:13:13,070 --> 00:13:17,900
Really?
I watched him convert.

264
00:13:18,110 --> 00:13:18,943
I'd watched him become radical.
I'd seen some of my own friends who had 

265
00:13:21,771 --> 00:13:22,604
converted in prison and changed yet,
so I'd seeing it or seeing this group 

266
00:13:26,570 --> 00:13:29,840
and then I watched an interview after 
the Beslan massacre where this group was

267
00:13:29,841 --> 00:13:32,770
saying in my hometown that if it 
happened to an English school,

268
00:13:32,780 --> 00:13:33,613
it would be justified.
And I also knew that that group openly 

269
00:13:37,710 --> 00:13:41,780
converting and recruiting in my town 
center where my family go.

270
00:13:41,781 --> 00:13:42,614
Where were y'all go?
They were openly recruiting on the 

271
00:13:44,091 --> 00:13:44,924
streets every single Saturday to send 
people to fight for the Taliban against 

272
00:13:48,291 --> 00:13:50,990
our armed forces.
And that was it for me.

273
00:13:50,991 --> 00:13:54,200
That was 2004.
I organized my first demonstration.

274
00:13:54,201 --> 00:13:55,034
I was aged 21 years old and I organize a
demonstration called bandaloop and 

275
00:13:58,480 --> 00:13:59,313
Taliban,

276
00:13:59,940 --> 00:14:04,200
so it's hard to believe that.
So they're actually recruiting in a town

277
00:14:04,201 --> 00:14:05,034
in England for the Taliban.
We know that a lot of Isis fighters are 

278
00:14:07,981 --> 00:14:08,814
coming from England.
They're coming from all of western 

279
00:14:10,291 --> 00:14:13,650
Europe basically going through Turkey 
right into Syria.

280
00:14:13,830 --> 00:14:17,160
What does law enforcement do about that?
It sounds like not much,

281
00:14:17,161 --> 00:14:17,970
right?

282
00:14:17,970 --> 00:14:19,420
I do nothing.
I do nothing.

283
00:14:19,630 --> 00:14:22,720
So what I did when I organize this 
demonstration,

284
00:14:22,721 --> 00:14:26,620
I actually made leaflets over 10 years 
ago now and in those leaflets,

285
00:14:26,621 --> 00:14:27,454
what we're going back 12 years,
so this was before people had heard of 

286
00:14:29,801 --> 00:14:33,730
homegrown terrorism in the UK before 
people have heard of these organizations

287
00:14:34,030 --> 00:14:34,863
and in the leaflets I made a point that 
our daughters and our sisters are being 

288
00:14:38,021 --> 00:14:38,854
groomed,
which we now know as an epidemic called 

289
00:14:40,420 --> 00:14:41,253
grooming,
which is where groups of Muslim men 

290
00:14:43,301 --> 00:14:44,134
would get young girls and their gang 
raped them and it's become an epidemic 

291
00:14:47,261 --> 00:14:50,530
across the UK,
but it's been going on for 30 years.

292
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:51,393
No one's ever spoke about it now.
Twelve years ago I made a leaflet which 

293
00:14:54,021 --> 00:14:58,400
went on the front page and one national 
news of my local newspaper saying whites

294
00:14:58,401 --> 00:14:59,234
and blacks are being religiously target.
Our women are being pimped and sexually 

295
00:15:02,751 --> 00:15:07,160
abused and prostituted by Muslim gangs.
I named the Muslim gangs.

296
00:15:07,310 --> 00:15:10,080
I named the extremist organizations.
Um,

297
00:15:10,310 --> 00:15:11,143
and I stood in the town center and read,
read this leaflet out wherever I said 

298
00:15:13,791 --> 00:15:18,380
that we demand that the police act with 
demand that the council's act,

299
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:21,140
um,
there was no action after that.

300
00:15:21,141 --> 00:15:22,940
In fact,
all that happened was I was targeted.

301
00:15:23,150 --> 00:15:24,530
I was targeted by Muslim gangs.

302
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:29,540
Can some of the blame here be blamed on 
something related to,

303
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:33,890
to British society that maybe we don't 
have here in America,

304
00:15:33,891 --> 00:15:34,724
America for all our faults and we have 
plenty of racial problems and all kinds 

305
00:15:36,831 --> 00:15:40,130
of stuff.
We've done the melting pot pretty well.

306
00:15:40,131 --> 00:15:43,160
Everyone is come here no matter where 
they're from.

307
00:15:43,161 --> 00:15:46,390
And pretty much mixed in bringing their 
traditions and then,

308
00:15:46,420 --> 00:15:47,253
and then becoming American.
It sounds like from the emails I'm 

309
00:15:49,581 --> 00:15:51,740
getting from Denmark and Sweden and all 
this,

310
00:15:51,741 --> 00:15:56,030
that something has happened in Europe,
but I guess specifically in the UK where

311
00:15:56,031 --> 00:15:56,864
for whatever reason,
the Muslim population just hasn't 

312
00:15:58,630 --> 00:16:03,170
integrated the way that other immigrant 
populations have been.

313
00:16:03,580 --> 00:16:08,000
Some of that be on the fault of the UK 
and not just the Muslim population.

314
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:09,240
Yes it can.
Yes.

315
00:16:09,540 --> 00:16:10,373
It can be on the,
with multiculturalists who encouraged 

316
00:16:13,301 --> 00:16:14,134
all these people to come here,
told them that their culture was equal 

317
00:16:16,361 --> 00:16:17,194
to us,
told them that they can go back into 

318
00:16:19,391 --> 00:16:22,060
their own communities.
They can live as they did in Afghanistan

319
00:16:22,061 --> 00:16:23,670
and Iraq and Pakistan.
Um,

320
00:16:24,110 --> 00:16:27,490
and as soon as anyone like ourselves try
to scratch beneath the surface to say,

321
00:16:27,491 --> 00:16:29,290
well,
let's see where we differ culturally.

322
00:16:29,590 --> 00:16:33,340
Let's see where our opinions differ.
Then we've been screened down as racist.

323
00:16:33,790 --> 00:16:36,010
And the reality is we need to 
understand,

324
00:16:36,220 --> 00:16:37,900
and you say it's worked relatively well 
in,

325
00:16:37,950 --> 00:16:38,800
in,
in America.

326
00:16:39,190 --> 00:16:40,023
You have nowhere near the percent of 
Muslims in comparison to Europe and it 

327
00:16:43,300 --> 00:16:45,020
and it will not work well in America.
And that's the,

328
00:16:45,021 --> 00:16:47,410
that's the bone.
And you need to realize is that you need

329
00:16:47,411 --> 00:16:48,244
to learn from what's happening over here
because you're going to face the same 

330
00:16:50,141 --> 00:16:50,974
problems.
If you're ever uneducated Somalians 

331
00:16:52,690 --> 00:16:53,523
coming in uncontrollable numbers,
you will face exactly the same problems 

332
00:16:56,020 --> 00:16:57,230
I've.
I've grown up with a loop.

333
00:16:58,510 --> 00:17:00,460
If you allow,
if you allow Saudi Arabia,

334
00:17:00,461 --> 00:17:02,010
you allow guitar,
you allow around,

335
00:17:02,230 --> 00:17:05,440
you allow them footholds in your country
with Salafist or what hobbies mosques.

336
00:17:05,590 --> 00:17:08,530
You allow them to build schools and 
teach these children hatred.

337
00:17:08,770 --> 00:17:09,603
You will in the next generation.
The experience in the height I 

338
00:17:11,861 --> 00:17:12,694
experienced growing up.

339
00:17:13,510 --> 00:17:17,040
So what do you think a town like yours 
where it.

340
00:17:17,140 --> 00:17:17,973
This has been growing for a long time as
you're saying what should be done at 

341
00:17:21,701 --> 00:17:22,534
this point?
I mean these people are citizens of the 

342
00:17:24,911 --> 00:17:25,744
UK.
So what should be done to fight these 

343
00:17:27,971 --> 00:17:29,740
ideas?
Not the people,

344
00:17:29,890 --> 00:17:31,900
but to fight these ideas that are 
spreading.

345
00:17:32,470 --> 00:17:32,960
What,
what,

346
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:36,690
what shouldn't be done is my local 
counsel spend 188,000

347
00:17:36,691 --> 00:17:40,710
pounds of tax payers money given,
given to the Salafist mosque.

348
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:44,270
I'm not a master.
Causes us huge problem that that's a mos

349
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:46,080
that went off set,
went in into it.

350
00:17:46,290 --> 00:17:49,770
They found books in the children's 
school library for how to handsome fee.

351
00:17:50,140 --> 00:17:53,010
Um,
we shouldn't be funding them.

352
00:17:53,250 --> 00:17:54,083
We also should not be allowed in Saudi 
Arabia or Qatar to fund these addresses 

353
00:17:57,720 --> 00:17:58,620
are popping up left,
right,

354
00:17:58,621 --> 00:18:02,400
and center.
We should be tough on,

355
00:18:02,490 --> 00:18:03,810
on,
on so many issues.

356
00:18:03,820 --> 00:18:04,590
We,
we,

357
00:18:04,590 --> 00:18:05,423
it's knowing where to start really.
And I think towns that haven't had the 

358
00:18:08,761 --> 00:18:12,540
problems at Luton have had,
should be looking to our town looking at

359
00:18:12,541 --> 00:18:13,374
the infiltration.
What we've seen is the way the Muslims 

360
00:18:16,531 --> 00:18:18,570
control themselves and the way they 
vote.

361
00:18:19,050 --> 00:18:22,350
Then our local council no longer care 
about us.

362
00:18:22,710 --> 00:18:24,990
They don't care because we don't keep 
them in power.

363
00:18:25,380 --> 00:18:30,280
The Labor party are kept in power every 
year in Luton by 30 to $50,000

364
00:18:30,300 --> 00:18:34,140
remotes.
So we become irrelevant and that's spoke

365
00:18:34,170 --> 00:18:35,003
bank politics and we don't vote based on
someone's ethnicity or we don't vote on 

366
00:18:39,220 --> 00:18:40,560
base somewhere.
Someone's religion,

367
00:18:40,590 --> 00:18:42,360
but the Muslim community do.
That's all they vote.

368
00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:43,301
Yeah.
So,

369
00:18:43,301 --> 00:18:44,590
you know,
even as I'm talking to you,

370
00:18:44,591 --> 00:18:46,750
I have this feeling because I'm a 
liberal,

371
00:18:46,751 --> 00:18:49,090
I have this feeling of,
you know,

372
00:18:49,091 --> 00:18:51,420
is he exaggerating this like,
is this,

373
00:18:52,030 --> 00:18:53,740
how big is this problem?
You know,

374
00:18:53,741 --> 00:18:57,070
I follow you on twitter,
you tweet videos all day long,

375
00:18:57,090 --> 00:18:57,870
have,
you know,

376
00:18:57,870 --> 00:19:02,770
women being attacked either in the UK or
in Germany or wherever,

377
00:19:03,010 --> 00:19:03,843
and sometimes I have trouble sort of 
figuring out how much of this is 

378
00:19:07,451 --> 00:19:08,284
actually happening all over the place.
How big are the problem is versus is it 

379
00:19:12,671 --> 00:19:15,130
just this micro problem?
Uh,

380
00:19:15,131 --> 00:19:17,140
and I guess I guess your answer would 
be,

381
00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:19,270
well,
if it's a micro problem in my town,

382
00:19:19,271 --> 00:19:20,104
but it's,
it's spreading into this big macro 

383
00:19:21,161 --> 00:19:21,994
thing.

384
00:19:22,060 --> 00:19:24,010
The problem is bigger than anyone can 
comprehend.

385
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:28,240
And that's why the political leaders,
that's why police forces,

386
00:19:28,241 --> 00:19:31,600
that's why it's now a fact in the UK 
that police,

387
00:19:31,750 --> 00:19:36,750
social workers councils conspired to 
hide these tracks for,

388
00:19:37,040 --> 00:19:37,930
for decades.

389
00:19:38,230 --> 00:19:40,340
Can go into that a little bit because 
there's been a couple,

390
00:19:40,390 --> 00:19:42,430
a couple controversies about that.

391
00:19:42,690 --> 00:19:43,150
Yeah.
So,

392
00:19:43,150 --> 00:19:43,983
so there,
there's been a rover and rapport before 

393
00:19:45,891 --> 00:19:47,110
this Robin,
Rapport Ppp.

394
00:19:47,111 --> 00:19:47,944
We used to,
people used to say I was lying or 

395
00:19:48,670 --> 00:19:49,503
inciting hate,
and I choose to say it because it 

396
00:19:50,651 --> 00:19:51,484
happened to my cousin,
the similar sorts of crimes and we knew 

397
00:19:53,411 --> 00:19:57,070
what the police reaction was then,
so there was a robin report and in depth

398
00:19:57,071 --> 00:20:01,330
report into one little small town in the
north of England in that small town,

399
00:20:01,331 --> 00:20:04,060
there's a population of male Muslims 
that are aged,

400
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:08,650
aged between 18 to 40.
There's about 3000 now in that town.

401
00:20:08,651 --> 00:20:13,600
They identified 1,400
young English girl who had been beaten,

402
00:20:13,601 --> 00:20:16,900
prostituted,
and right in unbelievable numbers.

403
00:20:16,901 --> 00:20:17,734
Some of the goals right?
30 Times in one night and when they've 

404
00:20:20,021 --> 00:20:20,854
done this big report,
what they've found in the report 

405
00:20:22,871 --> 00:20:23,704
actually was the council knew full well.
The head of the police knew the Muslim 

406
00:20:28,331 --> 00:20:32,020
community knew everyone knew this was 
happening,

407
00:20:32,260 --> 00:20:35,950
but the reason why they'd done nothing 
was through the fear of being branded as

408
00:20:35,951 --> 00:20:36,784
racists.

409
00:20:36,940 --> 00:20:38,860
That's how powerful political 
correctness is.

410
00:20:39,070 --> 00:20:39,903
Now two,
are there circumstances in this report 

411
00:20:42,250 --> 00:20:43,083
where the.
When the police turned up and there was 

412
00:20:44,951 --> 00:20:45,784
a young girl who was 11 years old and 
she's been in a derelict house by five 

413
00:20:48,821 --> 00:20:51,610
Muslim men now when the police turned 
up,

414
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,100
they arrested the girl for being drunk 
and disorderly.

415
00:20:54,690 --> 00:20:55,523
I let you've got to read the report that
you've got to read the report and also 

416
00:20:58,781 --> 00:21:01,890
there's another circumstance where the 
go the go.

417
00:21:02,020 --> 00:21:02,853
Two of the girls who were taken and 
these girls were missing for days at 12 

418
00:21:05,291 --> 00:21:06,310
years old,
13 years old,

419
00:21:06,311 --> 00:21:07,720
14 years old.
They're going to miss him for dates.

420
00:21:08,330 --> 00:21:11,260
Two of the girls were taken,
so the dads went to get the girls back.

421
00:21:11,410 --> 00:21:14,440
The goals were inside the house.
The dads have gone to the Muslim's house

422
00:21:14,441 --> 00:21:16,420
to get them back.
When the police turned up,

423
00:21:16,421 --> 00:21:18,250
the police arrested the English girls,
dads,

424
00:21:18,700 --> 00:21:21,070
they left the goat,
and so these sort of things,

425
00:21:21,071 --> 00:21:23,590
which one of your view is that they 
sound unbelievable.

426
00:21:24,520 --> 00:21:27,520
They sound unbelievable actually.
They're in a government report.

427
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:30,340
This is going on across our whole entire
country.

428
00:21:30,730 --> 00:21:33,460
This isn't just going on in our country 
is going on in Holland.

429
00:21:33,550 --> 00:21:34,940
It's gone on across Europe.
Look at,

430
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:35,793
look at what's happening in Sweden and 
this is comes from a mindset and a 

431
00:21:39,761 --> 00:21:43,960
culture and an ideology that teaches 
them that Muslim Muslim,

432
00:21:43,990 --> 00:21:48,990
not just more women are inferior but not
non Muslim women like ours,

433
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:50,473
that dirt.
Not that that's not all Muslims because 

434
00:21:52,750 --> 00:21:55,930
some Muslims I've grown up with would be
as disgusted as we are,

435
00:21:56,550 --> 00:21:57,383
but what?
There is a problem if you look at the 

436
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:00,633
statistics for these not paedophilia 
because the majority of pedophiles in 

437
00:22:04,271 --> 00:22:05,104
the UK are white,
which you'd expect from a 90 percent 

438
00:22:07,751 --> 00:22:09,680
white country.
This is a new,

439
00:22:09,681 --> 00:22:14,681
a new epidemic that men share young 
children with their brothers,

440
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:19,630
their cousins,
their work colleagues that the level,

441
00:22:19,690 --> 00:22:20,523
the viewing of it within the community 
or within the group is not viewed in a 

442
00:22:24,161 --> 00:22:26,090
similar way to how we would if it.

443
00:22:26,100 --> 00:22:27,430
If a member of our community.
He said,

444
00:22:27,431 --> 00:22:30,010
I've got this young 12 year old girl 
that you'd fill them in,

445
00:22:30,930 --> 00:22:31,763
but this is something very,
very different and it's new to the 

446
00:22:34,061 --> 00:22:37,750
country and what we're seeing now.
We've seen it with Cologne again,

447
00:22:37,751 --> 00:22:38,584
with on New Year's Eve is now been 
putting people's faces more than ever 

448
00:22:42,040 --> 00:22:45,890
and we feel.
I feel I've got two young daughters.

449
00:22:46,210 --> 00:22:49,720
I've got two young doors.
We have to.

450
00:22:49,890 --> 00:22:52,730
I was just speaking before about a 
professor who,

451
00:22:52,750 --> 00:22:53,583
who Angela Merkel's given a speech this 
week in a university and the professor 

452
00:22:56,921 --> 00:22:59,470
has stood up and he's heckled her and he
said,

453
00:22:59,620 --> 00:23:01,530
I'm scared.
I have children.

454
00:23:01,531 --> 00:23:02,740
I have children.
What,

455
00:23:02,741 --> 00:23:03,430
what,
what,

456
00:23:03,430 --> 00:23:04,263
what?
What future are you bringing to our 

457
00:23:05,021 --> 00:23:05,854
children?
This is an experiment you know nothing 

458
00:23:07,690 --> 00:23:10,960
about and that's the reality of it and 
it's not an experiment.

459
00:23:10,961 --> 00:23:12,850
We know nothing about.
We know what's going to happen.

460
00:23:13,030 --> 00:23:15,190
We know what's going to happen from case
studies.

461
00:23:15,460 --> 00:23:18,490
Luton town is a blueprint for the rest 
of the UK.

462
00:23:19,090 --> 00:23:22,030
It's a blueprint for the rest of Europe.
It's a blueprint for America.

463
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:23,890
What's happening here?
It's happening everywhere.

464
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:26,120
Yeah.
It's incredibly chilling,

465
00:23:26,121 --> 00:23:27,500
listening to you,
and again,

466
00:23:27,501 --> 00:23:28,334
that's why.
That's why I wanted to talk to you and 

467
00:23:30,260 --> 00:23:33,800
try to get a sense of the size of this 
whole thing.

468
00:23:33,801 --> 00:23:35,570
I saw a video this week.
Did you see this?

469
00:23:35,830 --> 00:23:36,663
A 16 year old girl posted a video from 
Germany talking about how she went to 

470
00:23:41,871 --> 00:23:46,640
her local supermarket and she saw these 
guys staring her and they were migraines

471
00:23:46,940 --> 00:23:50,000
and they were.
She really be was a afraid for her life.

472
00:23:50,001 --> 00:23:52,790
She posted a 20 minute video on 
facebook,

473
00:23:52,970 --> 00:23:55,040
which she clearly delineated.
She said,

474
00:23:55,041 --> 00:23:57,620
I have nothing against Muslim people.
She said,

475
00:23:57,621 --> 00:23:59,810
I have friends that are Muslim.
All of that stuff.

476
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:01,250
She said,
these people,

477
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:04,130
these specific people that are coming 
now,

478
00:24:04,250 --> 00:24:06,650
there's something different and from 
what I understand,

479
00:24:06,651 --> 00:24:07,484
the video was taken down and she was at 
least temporarily suspended from 

480
00:24:09,801 --> 00:24:10,634
facebook so that that really shows you 
how perverse the political correctness 

481
00:24:14,241 --> 00:24:16,700
has got.
If now facebook is in on it too.

482
00:24:17,190 --> 00:24:18,150
Oh,
facebook's completely.

483
00:24:18,920 --> 00:24:19,753
Everyone keeps getting suspended for 
posting videos or pictures of the 

484
00:24:22,501 --> 00:24:24,750
reality and the truth.
That young girl,

485
00:24:25,890 --> 00:24:26,723
my.
That angers me so much more than I can 

486
00:24:29,161 --> 00:24:32,850
even express when I watched that and I 
could well up in my eyes and thinking,

487
00:24:33,540 --> 00:24:37,260
she's not free to walk to our shops in 
Germany in 2016.

488
00:24:37,500 --> 00:24:38,333
Why is she not free?
Because hordes of hoards of Muslim men 

489
00:24:41,190 --> 00:24:43,830
are coming in from a completely 
different culture,

490
00:24:44,130 --> 00:24:44,963
a completely different view on women are
completely different that we have to 

491
00:24:47,641 --> 00:24:52,641
understand their mindset and what gets 
me is that I'm all for helping refugees.

492
00:24:53,970 --> 00:24:56,290
These are not refugees.
Sixty percent,

493
00:24:56,370 --> 00:24:57,203
60 percent this week.
The EU commissioner has come out and 

494
00:24:58,891 --> 00:25:01,200
said they're economic migrants.
Sixty percent.

495
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:04,920
Angela Merkel was open those borders to 
one and a half million last year.

496
00:25:05,310 --> 00:25:06,143
There is going to be a flood in the next
coming years of tens of millions of 

497
00:25:10,980 --> 00:25:11,813
Muslims come into come into Europe,
come into our continent where that go 

498
00:25:15,751 --> 00:25:19,470
and her feeling is just going to be 
natural to everybody.

499
00:25:19,680 --> 00:25:21,860
Everybody's going to be feeling and we 
shouldn't feel fearful.

500
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:26,160
When our in our own homes and towns and 
we do all we had,

501
00:25:26,161 --> 00:25:26,994
all I ever hear about is Islamophobia.
All we ever hear about is that Muslim 

502
00:25:29,941 --> 00:25:31,590
women are scared.
I'm not being funny,

503
00:25:31,591 --> 00:25:36,450
but no one's raped Muslim women.
No one is gang rape in Muslim women.

504
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:39,000
No young Muslim goals were attacked on 
New Year's Eve.

505
00:25:39,300 --> 00:25:41,970
No Muslim has had their heads hate cut 
off in the street.

506
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:44,850
No,
this is not happening to Muslims and,

507
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:45,713
and that's,
and that's where when we look at the 

508
00:25:47,281 --> 00:25:48,114
target,
and I had a meeting this week with lead 

509
00:25:51,090 --> 00:25:52,430
it,
with a leading of a seek,

510
00:25:52,610 --> 00:25:54,570
a safe organization.
You should talk to him.

511
00:25:54,571 --> 00:25:55,404
He,
he can give you a real in depth of 

512
00:25:56,311 --> 00:25:58,470
what's going on from a sales 
perspective.

513
00:25:59,250 --> 00:26:00,083
He deals with hundreds and hundreds of 
young children who have been taken from 

514
00:26:03,331 --> 00:26:04,800
their families by Muslim gangs.

515
00:26:05,090 --> 00:26:05,923
Um,
and in the most recent one when I went 

516
00:26:07,441 --> 00:26:09,450
with a radio presenter and the radio 
presenter said,

517
00:26:09,590 --> 00:26:11,850
where's got nothing to do with religion?
And he said,

518
00:26:11,940 --> 00:26:12,773
well actually everything they're saying 
to the girls while rape is about 

519
00:26:15,871 --> 00:26:16,704
religion is a religion or race or I can 
go through the court cases where there 

520
00:26:20,461 --> 00:26:21,294
was a smiley,
Smiley and rape gang down in Bristol in 

521
00:26:23,581 --> 00:26:24,414
the UK.
And he actually said it was his 

522
00:26:25,591 --> 00:26:27,660
religious duty to do this.
This is really.

523
00:26:27,750 --> 00:26:30,690
And these are not what we're saying is 
what they're saying.

524
00:26:30,990 --> 00:26:32,240
They're saying,
you white trash,

525
00:26:32,241 --> 00:26:33,074
you whitefield will gut you like a pig.
All of these comments are being made to 

526
00:26:36,991 --> 00:26:41,430
these young English girls and all 
everyone wants to get around.

527
00:26:41,431 --> 00:26:42,390
The fact is,
oh,

528
00:26:42,391 --> 00:26:44,520
everyone's or everyone does it.
No,

529
00:26:44,521 --> 00:26:47,730
not 90 percent.
The 90 percent of the convictions,

530
00:26:47,970 --> 00:26:51,990
the street gang grooming,
our Muslim men have a population of four

531
00:26:51,991 --> 00:26:52,810
percent.

532
00:26:52,810 --> 00:26:53,261
Well,
you know,

533
00:26:53,261 --> 00:26:54,094
I really am starting to see this as 
almost a disease of the mind of people 

534
00:26:57,821 --> 00:26:58,654
on the left because even if even if 
everything you were saying was being 

535
00:27:01,931 --> 00:27:05,080
magnified by 20 percent,
50 percent,

536
00:27:05,081 --> 00:27:07,380
let's say you're,
you're totally doubling the,

537
00:27:07,381 --> 00:27:10,420
the severity of all of this.
It's still a problem.

538
00:27:10,421 --> 00:27:13,750
And every time I hear my friends on the 
left talk about it,

539
00:27:13,751 --> 00:27:15,280
they'll immediately say,
well,

540
00:27:15,281 --> 00:27:16,450
you know,
Christianity,

541
00:27:16,451 --> 00:27:21,451
there were the crusades or the Catholic 
Church has covered up molesting children

542
00:27:21,791 --> 00:27:23,170
for hundreds of years.
All these things.

543
00:27:23,350 --> 00:27:25,870
No one's denying those things,
right?

544
00:27:25,871 --> 00:27:28,030
And some of those things are still 
happening right now,

545
00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:33,460
but that doesn't mean that what you're 
talking about isn't a problem.

546
00:27:33,610 --> 00:27:34,443
So my question to you is,
when in the UK did the left go off the 

547
00:27:38,291 --> 00:27:39,124
deep end,

548
00:27:39,850 --> 00:27:41,810
you say,
what will I keep trying to say?

549
00:27:41,811 --> 00:27:42,644
And I've tried to save for six years now
this is not a left wing or right wing 

550
00:27:44,780 --> 00:27:49,490
issue because people will automatically 
pigeonhole myself as right wing or no,

551
00:27:49,491 --> 00:27:51,650
actually that's a lie.
I'm pigeon holed as far.

552
00:27:51,651 --> 00:27:52,750
Right,
right.

553
00:27:53,160 --> 00:27:54,860
Or Am I ugly?
Um,

554
00:27:55,160 --> 00:27:55,993
whereas the majority of people who have 
supported my organization over the 

555
00:27:58,340 --> 00:27:59,173
years,
many of them would have been left wing 

556
00:28:00,261 --> 00:28:01,790
Labor votes.
Um,

557
00:28:02,270 --> 00:28:02,790
so

558
00:28:02,790 --> 00:28:03,623
to be clear,
the reason they'd be left wing is 

559
00:28:04,561 --> 00:28:06,570
because they're for women's rights,
right.

560
00:28:06,571 --> 00:28:09,810
And they're probably for gay rights and,
and they're generally for minorities.

561
00:28:09,900 --> 00:28:14,490
So they should fit on the left.
But yeah,

562
00:28:15,020 --> 00:28:16,490
that'd been pushed and forced to the 
right.

563
00:28:17,720 --> 00:28:18,553
And that's because the left in the UK 
politically rely and have basically the 

564
00:28:25,641 --> 00:28:27,230
Labour party in the UK,
they're,

565
00:28:27,330 --> 00:28:28,163
they're,
they're loyal vote bank used to be 

566
00:28:29,511 --> 00:28:31,370
working class people like myself.
Yeah.

567
00:28:31,860 --> 00:28:32,693
In,
in England we have a very classist 

568
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:34,353
system.
I don't think you've experienced the 

569
00:28:35,121 --> 00:28:37,310
same in America,
but we have a very classist system.

570
00:28:37,340 --> 00:28:40,370
We have the bottom and the top and you 
have what is fundamentally,

571
00:28:40,371 --> 00:28:41,204
usually conservative people were very 
wealthy and working class people are 

572
00:28:43,881 --> 00:28:46,910
usually quite poor or not,
or not quite poor,

573
00:28:46,911 --> 00:28:49,820
but Paul and proud anyway,
but what we.

574
00:28:49,880 --> 00:28:53,810
What we then see is that as,
as as working class people started doing

575
00:28:53,811 --> 00:28:54,644
better,
they would then aspire to be 

576
00:28:56,420 --> 00:28:58,130
conservative because they get more 
money.

577
00:28:58,131 --> 00:28:58,700
Yeah.
Right.

578
00:28:58,700 --> 00:29:01,760
So then it seems that the Labor Party,
you just completely give up on this,

579
00:29:01,940 --> 00:29:02,773
on this section of the community,
and they went straight for which Tony 

580
00:29:06,290 --> 00:29:06,430
Blair is.

581
00:29:06,430 --> 00:29:10,180
That government has have admitted,
bring in in loyal votes,

582
00:29:10,340 --> 00:29:12,920
which were immigrants which have now 
become Muslims.

583
00:29:14,360 --> 00:29:16,800
There's one speech where you can.
Anyone can watch it.

584
00:29:16,801 --> 00:29:20,400
It's his name.
So He'd met Malik and he's a.

585
00:29:20,450 --> 00:29:22,430
He was a Labor MP for Jews,
Brie.

586
00:29:22,460 --> 00:29:24,290
And in his speech,
he clearly tells us,

587
00:29:24,291 --> 00:29:27,560
Satan,
in 2001 we had one Muslim MP in 2004,

588
00:29:27,561 --> 00:29:31,000
we had free freedom is an MP in 2008 we 
had eight Ms Dot mmps.

589
00:29:31,180 --> 00:29:32,810
And in between saying each thing he 
says,

590
00:29:32,840 --> 00:29:34,440
inshallah,
inshallah and up.

591
00:29:34,790 --> 00:29:37,670
And he says,
we've been 15 years in this country.

592
00:29:37,730 --> 00:29:40,400
The majority of Mps will be Muslim and 
then or the crowd,

593
00:29:40,401 --> 00:29:44,800
which is a thousand or cheer and clap.
And then he says in,

594
00:29:44,890 --> 00:29:48,550
within 30 years the prime minister of 
this nation will share our faith.

595
00:29:49,930 --> 00:29:52,140
Now again,
or say,

596
00:29:52,180 --> 00:29:55,240
don't listen to what I'm saying.
There's plenty of Muslims.

597
00:29:55,660 --> 00:29:58,270
And when he says this as a 
representative for the Labor Party,

598
00:29:58,630 --> 00:30:01,750
this is the problem.
When you mix religion with politics,

599
00:30:02,110 --> 00:30:04,840
which is now happening,
just it goes like this.

600
00:30:04,841 --> 00:30:05,880
Now actually,
um,

601
00:30:06,220 --> 00:30:07,053
we have the Labor Party,
which is the leading left wing 

602
00:30:08,651 --> 00:30:12,070
organization.
When they have their meetings in Muslim,

603
00:30:12,071 --> 00:30:15,460
predominantly cities,
they segregate the odd audiences.

604
00:30:16,090 --> 00:30:18,900
They segregate the audience is men and 
women in law,

605
00:30:18,901 --> 00:30:21,880
in with Sharia.
This is a party that's supposed to stand

606
00:30:21,881 --> 00:30:24,510
up for women that's supposed to stand up
for gay people's rights.

607
00:30:24,820 --> 00:30:25,653
And that's why I'm,
I have our contempt and disgust with 

608
00:30:27,771 --> 00:30:28,604
what the,
what the Labor Party and the left have 

609
00:30:30,011 --> 00:30:30,844
now become.
But that doesn't mean all left wing 

610
00:30:31,841 --> 00:30:32,674
people because Islam is something that 
should concern and especially the 

611
00:30:35,770 --> 00:30:36,603
literal interpretations of it shouldn't 
concern everybody on the left and every 

612
00:30:39,131 --> 00:30:41,680
liberal should be screaming from the 
rooftops or what's happening.

613
00:30:41,870 --> 00:30:42,830
I know,
believe me,

614
00:30:42,860 --> 00:30:43,693
believe me,
I wish they were so just as long as 

615
00:30:45,231 --> 00:30:46,670
we're going on the political side of 
this.

616
00:30:46,910 --> 00:30:50,000
You were part of the British National 
Party for a while,

617
00:30:50,001 --> 00:30:50,834
I think about 10 years ago.
And you left because you thought they 

618
00:30:53,990 --> 00:30:55,310
were going too far,
right?

619
00:30:55,311 --> 00:30:58,760
You thought they were becoming racist 
and that caused you to leave.

620
00:30:58,920 --> 00:31:01,480
Correct.
So what happened was that,

621
00:31:01,500 --> 00:31:02,333
that was when,
when I spoke about the pendulum school 

622
00:31:03,450 --> 00:31:05,460
massacre,
which when I was 21,

623
00:31:05,700 --> 00:31:09,360
I started looking online to find who's 
talking about these things.

624
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:10,673
And there was only one group talking 
about and they were called the British 

625
00:31:11,971 --> 00:31:13,680
national Pi.
Um,

626
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:15,870
I joined the British National Party on a
12 month.

627
00:31:15,980 --> 00:31:16,813
They had a meeting,
so I went along to the meeting and I 

628
00:31:18,661 --> 00:31:19,494
joined in that meeting in my hometown.
They then set up a second meeting where 

629
00:31:23,581 --> 00:31:24,414
we were going to bring.
Our friends were not turned up with my 

630
00:31:26,041 --> 00:31:28,980
friends to the second meeting.
They said he can't come in,

631
00:31:29,040 --> 00:31:29,873
he can't come in.
It was the black lines with these 

632
00:31:32,700 --> 00:31:33,630
English lads.
Yeah,

633
00:31:33,690 --> 00:31:35,730
they're my best friends.
So they said they can't come in.

634
00:31:35,731 --> 00:31:37,290
So I said,
what do you mean they can't come in?

635
00:31:37,350 --> 00:31:40,470
And they saw non non white people can't 
join the British National Party.

636
00:31:41,010 --> 00:31:43,500
Now I was 21 years old,
never involved in politics,

637
00:31:43,510 --> 00:31:46,410
never an interest in policy.
So I didn't realize then that the leader

638
00:31:46,411 --> 00:31:48,180
of this organization is named Nick 
Griffin.

639
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:49,313
I didn't realize he was a holocaust 
denier or didn't realize that I didn't 

640
00:31:52,201 --> 00:31:54,960
realize that he used to be leader of the
National Front and RC organization.

641
00:31:55,410 --> 00:31:56,243
And so from that,
which there was a leaked membership 

642
00:31:58,321 --> 00:31:59,970
list,
which is how people know I as a member,

643
00:32:00,300 --> 00:32:02,070
but I didn't rejoin the next three 
years.

644
00:32:02,130 --> 00:32:04,980
That was my flirtation with the British 
National Party was done.

645
00:32:05,380 --> 00:32:09,720
Or then in 2009,
about five years later,

646
00:32:09,930 --> 00:32:10,763
I sat the English Defense League.
I set that up based on my own 

647
00:32:13,741 --> 00:32:14,820
principles,
which,

648
00:32:14,821 --> 00:32:15,654
where anyone can join.
We actually went onto have a Sikh 

649
00:32:19,021 --> 00:32:22,530
division I lesbian and gay division,
a Jewish division.

650
00:32:22,860 --> 00:32:23,693
Um,
and anyone that's affected by these 

651
00:32:25,141 --> 00:32:25,974
problems because I've,
I've grown up in a town where I don't 

652
00:32:29,131 --> 00:32:30,900
care about other cultures.
I don't care about.

653
00:32:31,080 --> 00:32:33,660
I don't care if you're gay,
I don't care if you're straight.

654
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:39,180
None of that bothers me.
My problem is with this radical,

655
00:32:39,610 --> 00:32:40,443
this radical ideology,
which is going to cause us all serious 

656
00:32:42,351 --> 00:32:43,184
problem.
So it's up.

657
00:32:43,190 --> 00:32:45,200
But like did leave the English Defense 
League as well?

658
00:32:45,201 --> 00:32:47,060
Yes.
I left in 2013.

659
00:32:47,540 --> 00:32:49,160
I left because I found that a lot more 
time.

660
00:32:49,190 --> 00:32:52,880
The majority of my time actually it was 
not spent trying to tackle the issues it

661
00:32:52,881 --> 00:32:57,500
was spent trying to keep backward inbred
far right Nazis out of the movement.

662
00:32:57,680 --> 00:32:59,600
Right.
So that's a really interesting point and

663
00:32:59,601 --> 00:33:01,940
I think it's sort of illuminates your 
story a lot,

664
00:33:01,941 --> 00:33:02,774
so to be clear you left one party 
because they didn't want black people 

665
00:33:06,921 --> 00:33:07,754
basically in their party.
And then when you started the edl where 

666
00:33:11,181 --> 00:33:14,030
you had plenty of people from all walks 
of life joining you,

667
00:33:14,031 --> 00:33:16,790
you ended up leaving that too because it
went too far.

668
00:33:16,791 --> 00:33:17,624
Right?
So when people paint you as this ultra 

669
00:33:19,311 --> 00:33:20,144
right nationalist,
whether they agree with all the other 

670
00:33:21,891 --> 00:33:23,930
stuff you're saying or not,
that just.

671
00:33:23,990 --> 00:33:26,630
It just isn't true from any estimation 
that I can see

672
00:33:27,030 --> 00:33:29,580
anyone.
Anyone can spend five minutes on Google,

673
00:33:29,670 --> 00:33:30,503
you can go to these ultra right wing 
Nazi nationalist organizations and see 

674
00:33:34,831 --> 00:33:35,664
what they think of me.
I get just as many death threats from 

675
00:33:38,011 --> 00:33:41,150
them.
I'm known as the real far away.

676
00:33:41,610 --> 00:33:43,250
See what happens is I get called fire,
right?

677
00:33:44,160 --> 00:33:46,650
The real far right in the UK.
I'm a Zionist.

678
00:33:46,690 --> 00:33:50,290
Do that.
That's why from the real Pharma,

679
00:33:50,291 --> 00:33:51,270
of course,
of course.

680
00:33:51,271 --> 00:33:52,170
Yeah,
of course.

681
00:33:53,420 --> 00:33:54,253
So real quick though on when you left,
the edl that was facilitated by 

682
00:33:57,470 --> 00:33:58,303
Quilliam,
which is marginalizes organization 

683
00:34:00,680 --> 00:34:03,530
that's trying to foster coexistence.
I've had my jacket on.

684
00:34:03,531 --> 00:34:05,720
I,
I hugely admire him.

685
00:34:05,721 --> 00:34:10,160
Can you just real quick explain how he 
helped facilitate you getting out?

686
00:34:10,720 --> 00:34:13,210
I was leaving.
I was leaving the organization anyway,

687
00:34:13,420 --> 00:34:15,730
so I was leaving.
I'd made the decision I was leaving.

688
00:34:16,060 --> 00:34:16,893
I then met,
imagine the was and I'd known of their 

689
00:34:19,861 --> 00:34:21,940
organization and some of the work that 
done anyway.

690
00:34:22,300 --> 00:34:23,770
I'm,
if I'm honest,

691
00:34:23,860 --> 00:34:26,970
it benefit me and it benefited him at 
that time and I'm,

692
00:34:27,010 --> 00:34:28,770
that's just me being completely honest.
I,

693
00:34:28,820 --> 00:34:29,653
I,
then I then spent some time with 

694
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:34,750
Quilliam who are seen as reformist 
Muslims.

695
00:34:34,751 --> 00:34:35,584
What,
what I realized it was the many of them 

696
00:34:38,141 --> 00:34:39,580
are,
if they're honest,

697
00:34:39,581 --> 00:34:41,460
are apostates.
Um,

698
00:34:41,470 --> 00:34:43,240
they don't follow the teachings of 
Islam,

699
00:34:43,390 --> 00:34:45,700
which is why they're saying able to say 
what they do,

700
00:34:46,150 --> 00:34:47,320
but then because of that

701
00:34:47,950 --> 00:34:49,210
softening the blow,
so to speak,

702
00:34:49,211 --> 00:34:51,760
they're not coming out right and saying 
we don't believe in this.

703
00:34:51,761 --> 00:34:52,594
They're saying we're trying to reform it
just because that's a little more 

704
00:34:54,131 --> 00:34:55,120
palatable,
sort of.

705
00:34:55,520 --> 00:34:56,353
Yeah,
but then their target that I actually 

706
00:34:57,651 --> 00:34:58,484
hate it more than me.
They're actually hated more than me by 

707
00:35:03,171 --> 00:35:05,630
Muslims and then the more time I spent.
Look,

708
00:35:05,930 --> 00:35:08,330
I met Majeed.
I'm a Sama,

709
00:35:08,331 --> 00:35:09,164
has a summer seminar,
still site is one of the most sincere 

710
00:35:11,511 --> 00:35:14,310
and decent men I've met in my life,
but they.

711
00:35:14,410 --> 00:35:18,950
They're not being entirely honest with 
the public about where we're at.

712
00:35:19,820 --> 00:35:24,100
I've done some training in there and I 
was taught that when we talk about Islam

713
00:35:24,101 --> 00:35:24,934
missed so that the acceptable word now 
is that we're against Islam is we're 

714
00:35:28,570 --> 00:35:29,403
against Islamism,
which if so then what they said is 

715
00:35:32,151 --> 00:35:32,984
Islamist ideology and they wrote a graph
and through this chart and it was 

716
00:35:35,961 --> 00:35:38,970
punishment for adultery,
a punishment for homosexuality.

717
00:35:39,210 --> 00:35:40,043
Oh,
the older backward ideas that come out 

718
00:35:41,101 --> 00:35:42,030
of it.
But,

719
00:35:42,210 --> 00:35:47,160
and they said that 90 percent of mosques
in the UK are propagating this.

720
00:35:47,610 --> 00:35:49,710
Not Ninety percent of the Muslims in the
mosque,

721
00:35:50,430 --> 00:35:51,263
but 90 percent of the mosque because 
who's funding and controlling them and 

722
00:35:53,581 --> 00:35:54,414
the hierarchy and the teachers.
And the mom's 90 percent of whom can't 

723
00:35:57,121 --> 00:35:58,150
speak English,
Iva,

724
00:35:58,560 --> 00:36:01,530
they're 90 percent of the Masa propagate
and Islamist ideology and they.

725
00:36:01,650 --> 00:36:05,580
They had Islamist ideology under folks 
Islam and then they had true Islam,

726
00:36:05,581 --> 00:36:08,970
which I said 10 percent work,
but obviously I have a huge problem with

727
00:36:08,971 --> 00:36:13,110
this because if 90 percent of 
propagating this in the UK,

728
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:14,033
that's true Islam,
I get what you're trying to do and I 

729
00:36:16,201 --> 00:36:17,034
wish you.
I wish you every success in trying to 

730
00:36:18,451 --> 00:36:21,960
change this,
but we've had 1400 years of history that

731
00:36:21,961 --> 00:36:25,020
shows it hasn't changed.
You're fighting a battle now where,

732
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:27,640
and I asked him when the last time I saw
a Sama,

733
00:36:27,660 --> 00:36:28,201
Sandra,
I said,

734
00:36:28,201 --> 00:36:31,680
how many people have you converted to 
your liberal form of Islam this week?

735
00:36:31,950 --> 00:36:32,783
Because while you've been doing that,
radical extremists in prisons across 

736
00:36:36,391 --> 00:36:37,224
this country and Taoist tools across 
this country are probably converted 

737
00:36:39,631 --> 00:36:40,220
thousands.

738
00:36:40,220 --> 00:36:41,780
Yeah,
and I want to get to the prison part and

739
00:36:41,781 --> 00:36:45,800
a little bit because you've had some 
completely insane experiences in prison,

740
00:36:46,100 --> 00:36:46,933
but just to wrap this part up,
the interesting piece here is that 

741
00:36:49,820 --> 00:36:53,810
although you're not working with my 
jihad now you guys in your own way,

742
00:36:53,840 --> 00:36:57,770
you're both apostates to your community.
He's considered,

743
00:36:57,860 --> 00:36:58,693
you know,
I see all the horrible things that 

744
00:36:59,661 --> 00:37:00,494
people call him,
porch monkey and terrible things coming 

745
00:37:02,931 --> 00:37:03,764
out of the Muslim community saying about
him and coming from white people on the 

746
00:37:07,071 --> 00:37:07,904
left,
which they'd be considered racist if 

747
00:37:09,261 --> 00:37:11,510
they said it about about a black person 
of course,

748
00:37:11,660 --> 00:37:12,493
but in a way you both are now sort of 
outcasts and that kind of brings you 

749
00:37:16,371 --> 00:37:17,960
together.
Which to me,

750
00:37:17,961 --> 00:37:18,794
that's where the real conversation is.
Whether you work with him or kill him 

751
00:37:22,251 --> 00:37:23,270
ever again.
That's,

752
00:37:23,330 --> 00:37:25,910
that's the lane that this has to go 
down.

753
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:30,110
The conversation is,
but this isn't a time for conversation.

754
00:37:30,470 --> 00:37:31,303
It's like it's.
If we could rely on Muslims to solve 

755
00:37:34,101 --> 00:37:36,530
this problem.
If I'm at the opinion now,

756
00:37:36,531 --> 00:37:37,970
we can't.
Unfortunately.

757
00:37:38,300 --> 00:37:39,133
I think I spent two years float in there
with different groups and talking to 

758
00:37:42,380 --> 00:37:45,680
every moderate Muslim I'm introduced to 
just tomorrow night in the UK.

759
00:37:45,681 --> 00:37:49,490
There's a BBC radio four program and I 
went last week because we're going and I

760
00:37:49,550 --> 00:37:50,383
traveled round me in Muslim leaders 
again and when I met this account or 

761
00:37:53,661 --> 00:37:54,494
extremism,
counter terrorism hailed as the most 

762
00:37:56,631 --> 00:38:00,200
moderate of Muslims you can get.
When I sat down with him,

763
00:38:00,201 --> 00:38:01,034
I said,
will you please condemn punishment for 

764
00:38:02,271 --> 00:38:03,104
apostasy in the Islamic states?
Whether that be in Saudi Arabia just 

765
00:38:06,711 --> 00:38:07,930
anywhere in the world,
please condemn it,

766
00:38:08,540 --> 00:38:09,920
wouldn't do it.
I said,

767
00:38:09,921 --> 00:38:10,754
you can't even condemn that.
Someone has the freedom to think you 

768
00:38:12,681 --> 00:38:13,490
can't even do that.

769
00:38:13,490 --> 00:38:13,821
He goes,
well,

770
00:38:13,821 --> 00:38:15,260
we're not there.
I said it.

771
00:38:15,320 --> 00:38:17,420
That's not hard.
It's not difficult if you want people to

772
00:38:17,421 --> 00:38:19,160
be punished for thinking a different way
or you don't,

773
00:38:19,340 --> 00:38:22,940
and this is another Muslim that's hailed
as the most moderate and to be honest,

774
00:38:23,180 --> 00:38:28,180
if I can't say I've met one of other 
match in the West other than some of the

775
00:38:28,221 --> 00:38:29,930
Muslims in Quilliam,
other than that,

776
00:38:29,931 --> 00:38:32,290
older and older Muslims I've met and 
I've.

777
00:38:32,291 --> 00:38:33,124
I've pushed them on questions.
I found that once I scratched onto 

778
00:38:35,900 --> 00:38:37,950
beneath the surface,
actually they hold some quite a point of

779
00:38:37,951 --> 00:38:41,710
views.
They do and if it was time for,

780
00:38:41,890 --> 00:38:42,723
if Muslims could solve this problem,
then the combined military force around 

781
00:38:45,341 --> 00:38:46,174
in 50 to 100,000
isis soldiers or Isis Millan's is up to 

782
00:38:49,301 --> 00:38:52,360
$5,000,000
combined military force and they've done

783
00:38:52,361 --> 00:38:55,720
nothing and they're not going to.
So we,

784
00:38:55,780 --> 00:38:57,580
we have,
we have to do things now.

785
00:38:57,610 --> 00:38:58,443
We have to enforce laws.
We have to push agendas that are going 

786
00:39:01,481 --> 00:39:02,314
to make sure that we're secure and to 
make sure that we are not just secure 

787
00:39:04,811 --> 00:39:07,680
but stable in the future and we can't 
rely on Muslims to do.

788
00:39:07,810 --> 00:39:08,643
Okay,
so you bring up some of what's going on 

789
00:39:10,631 --> 00:39:14,560
with the prison system in the UK.
You've been to prison a couple times.

790
00:39:14,561 --> 00:39:16,450
Actually,
I think about two weeks ago.

791
00:39:16,540 --> 00:39:18,310
You might've been in prison for a day or
something.

792
00:39:18,311 --> 00:39:19,144
Is that right?

793
00:39:19,570 --> 00:39:22,360
I'm almost arrested.
I've been arrested and charged again.

794
00:39:22,361 --> 00:39:22,680
Yes.

795
00:39:22,680 --> 00:39:24,900
Yeah.
So I don't want to get too much into the

796
00:39:24,901 --> 00:39:28,770
things that you've been arrested for.
Some of them sound like extremely jumped

797
00:39:28,890 --> 00:39:29,723
a trumped up charges.
This is a lot of what your book is 

798
00:39:31,591 --> 00:39:34,710
about,
but can you talk a little bit about what

799
00:39:34,711 --> 00:39:35,544
your experience was like in prison and 
how powerful the ideas of Islamism are 

800
00:39:41,431 --> 00:39:43,230
actually spreading in the prison system?

801
00:39:44,380 --> 00:39:46,610
Sorry,
from the first time I went to custody in

802
00:39:46,611 --> 00:39:47,444
2004,
2005 things have moved forward very 

803
00:39:51,411 --> 00:39:53,460
quickly within the prison system,
so to say.

804
00:39:53,640 --> 00:39:56,570
Then the next time that I went back into
prison was um,

805
00:39:57,290 --> 00:40:01,220
2010 for actually illegally enter enter 
in America,

806
00:40:01,221 --> 00:40:02,650
but that was,
um,

807
00:40:02,690 --> 00:40:03,523
2010.
And what I've witnessed each time I've 

808
00:40:05,931 --> 00:40:10,931
been in custody would terrify anyone.
And I honestly say that if you could see

809
00:40:12,110 --> 00:40:12,943
the maximum security prisons that were 
the most dangerous prisoners and most 

810
00:40:16,371 --> 00:40:20,090
dangerous men in the UK are being used 
as ics training camps,

811
00:40:21,130 --> 00:40:23,000
training camps,
the white labs,

812
00:40:23,001 --> 00:40:25,130
the black glass,
everyone is converting,

813
00:40:25,190 --> 00:40:30,190
everyone has a big huge bed.
It is the biggest gang in the system.

814
00:40:30,680 --> 00:40:33,590
And it's something that the authorities 
have not got grip off.

815
00:40:33,650 --> 00:40:36,800
They can't control the mom,
God bless them.

816
00:40:36,801 --> 00:40:38,750
Some of them are,
are trying,

817
00:40:39,080 --> 00:40:40,710
um,
but they're seen as student.

818
00:40:40,711 --> 00:40:42,580
He has to.
So the moms,

819
00:40:42,890 --> 00:40:43,723
people are not taking their Shahada and 
converting to Islam in the mosque on 

820
00:40:46,401 --> 00:40:47,350
Friday.
They're,

821
00:40:47,370 --> 00:40:49,880
they're doing on the wing,
on the prisoners wings.

822
00:40:49,881 --> 00:40:50,960
They run their own mosques.

823
00:40:51,920 --> 00:40:52,753
So this is going to sound sort of 
amateurish because I've never been to 

824
00:40:54,861 --> 00:40:56,450
prison.
But when you've been there,

825
00:40:56,870 --> 00:40:59,450
what,
like how is it that these ideas spread?

826
00:40:59,451 --> 00:41:02,160
Why is it that the prison system is 
allowing,

827
00:41:02,161 --> 00:41:03,710
and I know this,
this is in the United States,

828
00:41:03,711 --> 00:41:04,544
do with,
there's all kinds of crazy religious 

829
00:41:05,571 --> 00:41:08,600
stuff that goes on in prisons and drug 
deals and all,

830
00:41:08,601 --> 00:41:09,620
you know,
it's all nuts.

831
00:41:09,830 --> 00:41:13,850
But what is going on that that they are 
even allowing these ideas,

832
00:41:14,010 --> 00:41:14,843
bread,

833
00:41:15,090 --> 00:41:15,980
they call it,
stop them.

834
00:41:16,370 --> 00:41:21,370
I can't stop.
It's say Islam forms of Providence.

835
00:41:22,630 --> 00:41:24,900
I probably heard you mess with one 
Muslim.

836
00:41:24,930 --> 00:41:29,670
You mess with every Muslim.
So in some instances Islam is being used

837
00:41:29,671 --> 00:41:30,504
within the prison system,
used for power control and money is 

838
00:41:33,471 --> 00:41:35,330
something that anyone can attach 
themselves to.

839
00:41:35,331 --> 00:41:36,164
And and that's what's happened.
But it's also been orchestrated and 

840
00:41:38,181 --> 00:41:39,014
organized to you see in in British 
prisons where if a Muslim gets another 

841
00:41:42,680 --> 00:41:46,460
non-muslims convert outside,
sources are sending them in money.

842
00:41:47,020 --> 00:41:47,641
Yeah.
To.

843
00:41:47,641 --> 00:41:50,060
And also if you know the ideology of 
Islam,

844
00:41:50,420 --> 00:41:52,280
it's the pathway to heaven.
For them,

845
00:41:52,700 --> 00:41:54,560
it's the pathway to heaven is to spread 
Islam,

846
00:41:54,561 --> 00:41:55,394
to spread dour and to convert prisoners.
But what you're seeing then is some of 

847
00:41:58,311 --> 00:42:02,000
the most dangerous and extreme people in
the UK are converting to Islam.

848
00:42:02,330 --> 00:42:04,970
And it also gives,
when I say it's powerful,

849
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:05,833
we look in the UK,
we've lost our identity through 

850
00:42:08,421 --> 00:42:11,030
political correctness and for years and 
years of being beaten down.

851
00:42:11,690 --> 00:42:13,580
English people have lost their 
community.

852
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:15,073
We don't have the community feeling that
the Muslim community have and when 

853
00:42:18,591 --> 00:42:21,470
you've lost your identity and your tour 
time and time again,

854
00:42:21,471 --> 00:42:22,304
or you're told Time and time again that 
your identity and your culture and your 

855
00:42:24,441 --> 00:42:27,890
history is not good,
and then and then comes along this,

856
00:42:28,290 --> 00:42:29,123
this powerful,
powerful community that will stick 

857
00:42:32,211 --> 00:42:33,044
together and we and you'll never be on 
your own and it gives them everything 

858
00:42:36,741 --> 00:42:38,960
they had been searching for.
You have to remember a lot of people who

859
00:42:38,961 --> 00:42:43,100
are in the prison system have been wrong
their whole life from a very young age.

860
00:42:43,160 --> 00:42:44,720
They.
They've done a lot of wrong as well,

861
00:42:44,870 --> 00:42:46,760
but there's a reason many of them and 
chose that path.

862
00:42:46,761 --> 00:42:48,520
They've started with nothing.
They've had nothing.

863
00:42:48,530 --> 00:42:50,990
They've got nothing.
Islam gives them a course.

864
00:42:51,290 --> 00:42:52,850
It gives them something to fight for.

865
00:42:53,060 --> 00:42:56,060
It gives them something to concentrate 
on it and it all.

866
00:42:56,280 --> 00:42:57,113
I've seen a lot in my life,
but what I saw happening in the prison 

867
00:42:59,451 --> 00:43:00,284
system,
I don't know how we're gonna deal with 

868
00:43:02,810 --> 00:43:04,670
it.
I think steps we can take.

869
00:43:04,680 --> 00:43:08,120
If you look at the statistics in French 
prisons that have a population of,

870
00:43:08,121 --> 00:43:13,121
I believe seven percent Muslim,
70 percent of the prisoners on Muslim in

871
00:43:14,001 --> 00:43:16,670
the UK.
I spoke to prison officers who said that

872
00:43:16,671 --> 00:43:17,504
in one week they had 60 conversions 
because a Muslim gang had come into the 

873
00:43:20,391 --> 00:43:24,380
prison and just started beating an 
attack and everybody to convert and then

874
00:43:24,381 --> 00:43:26,960
before you know it,
everyone just converse for the,

875
00:43:27,020 --> 00:43:29,690
for the easy time because if you're in 
trouble when you want protection,

876
00:43:29,691 --> 00:43:30,480
you convert.

877
00:43:30,480 --> 00:43:33,570
So when you were in jail,
speaking of being beaten,

878
00:43:34,090 --> 00:43:37,530
you were beaten basically to a pulp,
right?

879
00:43:37,531 --> 00:43:40,890
I mean all your teeth knocked out and 
really some horrible stuff,

880
00:43:40,891 --> 00:43:43,710
but you'd never converted.
So how did you even,

881
00:43:43,790 --> 00:43:47,100
or I guess just talk about the violence 
that you were subjected to first.

882
00:43:47,680 --> 00:43:48,513
So I was in the UK prison system.
They have laws and rules that they have 

883
00:43:51,581 --> 00:43:52,414
to follow.
They have a duty of care for every 

884
00:43:53,441 --> 00:43:54,274
prisoner.
Now what they did when against every 

885
00:43:57,311 --> 00:43:59,220
single one.
So I'm under no doubt.

886
00:43:59,230 --> 00:43:59,811
In fact,
if I,

887
00:43:59,811 --> 00:44:00,644
if I taught when I was taken to woodhill
here was a maximum security prison in 

888
00:44:03,431 --> 00:44:04,270
the UK,
the houses,

889
00:44:04,271 --> 00:44:06,520
some of the country's most feared and 
dangerous terrorists.

890
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:12,000
I was in prison for a financial 
irregularity on a form for that,

891
00:44:12,401 --> 00:44:13,234
for that offense.
You go to an open prison where you go 

892
00:44:15,071 --> 00:44:15,904
home.
I was taken to a maximum security 

893
00:44:17,921 --> 00:44:18,970
category,
a prison.

894
00:44:19,540 --> 00:44:20,950
I was Po,
Po,

895
00:44:21,050 --> 00:44:24,550
po in my cell,
and that very first day when my daughter

896
00:44:24,551 --> 00:44:27,340
first I opened it,
it was an ex world marine commando who's

897
00:44:27,341 --> 00:44:28,960
a British,
the British military,

898
00:44:29,260 --> 00:44:31,470
and he said,
when they come to get you from cell,

899
00:44:31,500 --> 00:44:33,230
do not leave this cell,
and I went,

900
00:44:33,300 --> 00:44:33,960
what?

901
00:44:33,960 --> 00:44:35,160
He goes,
you're life depends on it.

902
00:44:35,200 --> 00:44:36,033
Don't leave this cell,
and then 10 minutes late he's come with 

903
00:44:38,551 --> 00:44:40,110
two other prison officers and said,
come on.

904
00:44:40,230 --> 00:44:41,063
You're going to be with.
Obviously I'll say that I'm not going 

905
00:44:43,441 --> 00:44:44,550
anywhere.
I'm not.

906
00:44:44,670 --> 00:44:45,503
I'm not leaving this cell because I 
didn't leave the so I didn't get 

907
00:44:47,971 --> 00:44:50,060
arrested,
so I'll get further charge,

908
00:44:50,090 --> 00:44:52,790
but I'm arrested and then.
And then I go to see Miss Lisa.

909
00:44:52,810 --> 00:44:57,480
The next day and I have a meeting with 
my solicitor about what's happening when

910
00:44:57,481 --> 00:44:58,314
they take me back after the meeting and 
they opened up a waiting room and as 

911
00:45:00,571 --> 00:45:04,110
soon as I look in the waiting room,
I see the big huge beard of a white,

912
00:45:04,170 --> 00:45:05,003
a white convert on putting into the room
of about eight people in it and I'm 

913
00:45:08,920 --> 00:45:12,120
violently attacked and the door's 
locked.

914
00:45:12,300 --> 00:45:14,630
The door was locked by the prison 
officers,

915
00:45:14,640 --> 00:45:18,090
the doors locked and I'm left to be bit 
by Libyan and then not just that,

916
00:45:18,091 --> 00:45:19,770
but I was arrested again for fine.

917
00:45:19,910 --> 00:45:20,743
They said,
but that's just one experience in the 

918
00:45:23,221 --> 00:45:24,120
prison system.
To be honest.

919
00:45:24,330 --> 00:45:25,163
I'm lucky and I believe that people were
pulling strings in order to have me 

920
00:45:27,601 --> 00:45:28,434
killed.
Now I think even that they are 

921
00:45:29,791 --> 00:45:30,624
scratching their heads to how I walked 
out and that's just one experience 

922
00:45:34,261 --> 00:45:35,280
that's happened.
Time and time.

923
00:45:35,420 --> 00:45:38,460
Mind you said,
I spent a day the other week in custody.

924
00:45:38,461 --> 00:45:40,800
Again,
this was.

925
00:45:40,801 --> 00:45:43,500
This was quite recent,
just probably six months ago.

926
00:45:43,890 --> 00:45:44,723
I was coming to the end of my license 
period with the authorities where they 

927
00:45:47,281 --> 00:45:48,114
have you on a control order.
I wasn't allowed to contact people who 

928
00:45:50,581 --> 00:45:52,610
are in the organization are used to,
used to.

929
00:45:52,650 --> 00:45:55,080
And this was for a mortgage,
a so called mortgage for it.

930
00:45:55,520 --> 00:45:56,800
Anyone who reads,
reads,

931
00:45:58,220 --> 00:46:00,600
reads the story of what happened.
We'll see what it was all about.

932
00:46:00,601 --> 00:46:01,434
But I was um,
I was taken from the last eight days so 

933
00:46:04,801 --> 00:46:06,510
it lost its or put back in prison.

934
00:46:07,330 --> 00:46:11,460
I was taken to a prison called 
Peterborough where I said at the stars,

935
00:46:11,461 --> 00:46:14,250
so there's got days left.
I dice,

936
00:46:14,700 --> 00:46:15,980
I'm going to get killed.
Yeah,

937
00:46:16,170 --> 00:46:18,090
just put me in,
put me in isolation.

938
00:46:18,150 --> 00:46:20,070
I don't care if you don't open the door 
for eight days.

939
00:46:20,730 --> 00:46:21,563
The idea is let me go home.
I'll come out with myself and I've 

940
00:46:23,761 --> 00:46:25,320
talked to prison officer again.
I said,

941
00:46:25,321 --> 00:46:26,760
look,
we know what's going to happen here.

942
00:46:27,120 --> 00:46:27,631
And they've said,
oh,

943
00:46:27,631 --> 00:46:28,464
we'll have a word.
And then I prisoners come up to me what 

944
00:46:31,441 --> 00:46:32,590
an English prison.
And he,

945
00:46:32,630 --> 00:46:33,870
he put his hand over his mouth.
He said,

946
00:46:33,871 --> 00:46:36,630
you're going to get done with Baltimore 
now in prison,

947
00:46:36,660 --> 00:46:39,090
in prison.
They put boiling water with sugar and it

948
00:46:39,091 --> 00:46:40,620
takes you,
it will take your face off.

949
00:46:41,010 --> 00:46:43,320
So I'm looking,
I've got two minutes to think.

950
00:46:44,130 --> 00:46:45,210
I said who's going to do it?

951
00:46:45,480 --> 00:46:46,313
And he said,
the lag behind the door has put the 

952
00:46:47,701 --> 00:46:49,620
money up because he'd paid money to have
me her.

953
00:46:49,950 --> 00:46:50,783
Now the lag behind the standing next to 
the door was doing 28 years in prison 

954
00:46:54,540 --> 00:46:56,370
for a murder where they can't,
a man's nose,

955
00:46:56,700 --> 00:46:57,331
eyes,
ears off,

956
00:46:57,331 --> 00:46:58,164
making odium.
Now there was four of them in for that 

957
00:47:00,061 --> 00:47:01,950
murder.
I'm in eight days.

958
00:47:02,370 --> 00:47:04,770
I am known as someone who,
who has,

959
00:47:04,771 --> 00:47:05,431
uh,
I've had,

960
00:47:05,431 --> 00:47:07,350
uh,
Al Shabaab have named me to be killed.

961
00:47:07,560 --> 00:47:08,393
I've had six government ultimate 
mornings sign that there is 

962
00:47:10,650 --> 00:47:12,390
intelligence.
I'm going to be murdered by Muslims.

963
00:47:12,690 --> 00:47:16,200
And here I am doing eight days house 
with Muslim murderers.

964
00:47:17,370 --> 00:47:19,230
Sorry.
And then,

965
00:47:19,231 --> 00:47:22,020
um,
so my mind's going quick.

966
00:47:22,820 --> 00:47:23,653
I already know that.
I've asked the principal far to 

967
00:47:24,631 --> 00:47:26,730
segregate me.
So there is no luck there.

968
00:47:27,030 --> 00:47:27,863
I look across,
I know I do what I had to do and before 

969
00:47:32,141 --> 00:47:33,930
he has a chance to turn around with his 
comp,

970
00:47:34,150 --> 00:47:36,730
I strike him and then and then the 
prison,

971
00:47:36,760 --> 00:47:38,060
old older screws.

972
00:47:38,190 --> 00:47:40,720
The prison officers come and jump in.
Now.

973
00:47:41,050 --> 00:47:44,380
I went before the prison governor for 
that offense where I explain myself.

974
00:47:44,381 --> 00:47:44,910
I said,
look,

975
00:47:44,910 --> 00:47:46,710
you put me in this position where I've 
got.

976
00:47:46,711 --> 00:47:50,050
I have to defend myself.
They decided to take no further action.

977
00:47:50,530 --> 00:47:51,363
I was then I was released from prison or
they went on a holiday with my wife and 

978
00:47:54,791 --> 00:47:55,624
children.
I landed back at home at Luton airport 

979
00:47:57,400 --> 00:47:59,440
at midnight and the police were waiting 
for me.

980
00:47:59,770 --> 00:48:03,370
They arrested me in front of my kids and
they arrested me for the,

981
00:48:03,430 --> 00:48:06,900
for attacking the Somalia and prisoner 
who was going to do me a boy.

982
00:48:06,950 --> 00:48:07,783
The more they then made a decision in 
October last year to have no further 

983
00:48:12,011 --> 00:48:13,360
action,
so they said,

984
00:48:13,361 --> 00:48:16,330
we're not taking any further action.
I then recently,

985
00:48:16,331 --> 00:48:18,820
just two weeks ago,
I launched a Poquito UK,

986
00:48:18,821 --> 00:48:22,390
which is a new organization to have 
street demonstrations and two days later

987
00:48:22,391 --> 00:48:23,224
they come and they come and rearrested 
me for the offense that they'd already 

988
00:48:25,181 --> 00:48:26,014
dropped.

989
00:48:27,720 --> 00:48:31,980
This is a lot of what your book is about
and it's sort of this endless cycle that

990
00:48:31,981 --> 00:48:33,930
you've been part of.
Um,

991
00:48:33,950 --> 00:48:36,570
and I know we could talk about the 
prison stuff forever because you're just

992
00:48:36,571 --> 00:48:37,404
scratching the surface of it,
but let's talk about Paquita a little 

993
00:48:40,111 --> 00:48:40,944
bit.
So I think you just got back from 

994
00:48:41,701 --> 00:48:42,534
Germany.
You were doing something with them in 

995
00:48:43,201 --> 00:48:43,770
Germany,

996
00:48:43,770 --> 00:48:44,890
is that right?
Yeah,

997
00:48:45,020 --> 00:48:47,790
I'll just come back last night.
So I went to Copenhagen First,

998
00:48:48,160 --> 00:48:48,993
um,
where I bought British journalist with 

999
00:48:50,131 --> 00:48:50,964
us.
So we went to Copenhagen to sort of 

1000
00:48:52,531 --> 00:48:53,364
launch Paquita in Denmark and to ask the
people to stand with us on the sixth of 

1001
00:48:56,671 --> 00:48:57,504
February because on the sixth of 
February we're planning demonstrations 

1002
00:49:00,361 --> 00:49:01,194
in 14 countries.
Now this is the first time a coalition 

1003
00:49:04,861 --> 00:49:07,960
like this has been formed and it's only 
been made possible by the people,

1004
00:49:08,010 --> 00:49:08,843
by the commitment,
and the people have dressed and their 

1005
00:49:10,441 --> 00:49:12,420
leadership have looked back mountain and
the other.

1006
00:49:12,630 --> 00:49:15,270
The other is interesting because for the
last year,

1007
00:49:15,810 --> 00:49:16,643
every single Monday for 52 weeks,
they have taken to the streets in their 

1008
00:49:20,971 --> 00:49:23,030
tens of thousands of times.
The,

1009
00:49:23,200 --> 00:49:24,240
the,
the demonstration.

1010
00:49:24,241 --> 00:49:26,910
I just went through this Monday,
there was well over 10 to 15,000

1011
00:49:26,911 --> 00:49:31,740
people there in a completely peaceful 
and civilized manner to express their,

1012
00:49:32,050 --> 00:49:33,970
their concern,
free passive resistance.

1013
00:49:33,971 --> 00:49:34,804
So what's happening?

1014
00:49:35,520 --> 00:49:37,590
So just to be clear,
when,

1015
00:49:37,591 --> 00:49:38,910
when this,
uh,

1016
00:49:38,940 --> 00:49:42,660
this mass attack happened in Cologne 
just a couple of weeks ago,

1017
00:49:42,661 --> 00:49:44,150
at the beginning of the year,
uh,

1018
00:49:44,460 --> 00:49:46,380
it seemed like the police were not 
there.

1019
00:49:46,440 --> 00:49:47,273
People did not know who to turn to.
A women were literally were being raped 

1020
00:49:50,761 --> 00:49:51,594
and attacked and all of that stuff.
And then there were some demonstrations 

1021
00:49:53,611 --> 00:49:55,950
a couple of days later,
I think in Colona and some other cities.

1022
00:49:56,070 --> 00:49:56,903
And suddenly there were a lot of police 
to police the people that were there to 

1023
00:50:02,100 --> 00:50:04,410
protest the violence that happened to 
the women.

1024
00:50:05,160 --> 00:50:06,900
Something really backwards here.

1025
00:50:07,330 --> 00:50:08,620
Oh,
is there at that demonstration?

1026
00:50:08,621 --> 00:50:10,360
I.
I know exactly what it is.

1027
00:50:10,750 --> 00:50:11,583
When you,
when you get large disturbances of 

1028
00:50:13,631 --> 00:50:15,540
Muslims,
the police do stairway.

1029
00:50:16,230 --> 00:50:18,190
They.
Because if they go in with their bands,

1030
00:50:18,280 --> 00:50:19,113
if they go in and try and please the 
streets provoke a riot and that riot 

1031
00:50:23,170 --> 00:50:24,003
will spread and they know that so that 
we've seen that many times when we hang 

1032
00:50:28,101 --> 00:50:29,690
up here,
I can send you a video after video,

1033
00:50:29,691 --> 00:50:32,090
which actually shows the police running 
away in the UK.

1034
00:50:32,570 --> 00:50:35,620
Now they don't run away from us.
They knock your teeth out and knock your

1035
00:50:35,621 --> 00:50:37,810
head off before they run away.
When it comes to,

1036
00:50:37,811 --> 00:50:39,920
they're told to police the communities 
differently.

1037
00:50:40,010 --> 00:50:40,843
Now on New Year's Eve,
the head of the police actually asked 

1038
00:50:44,360 --> 00:50:45,193
his superiors.
He asked for an extra hundred police 

1039
00:50:46,911 --> 00:50:48,380
officers.
He was refused.

1040
00:50:49,250 --> 00:50:50,083
And then what we saw was these massive 
attacks and these mass rapes of of 

1041
00:50:53,331 --> 00:50:54,164
German women.
And you're right there no one to turn 

1042
00:50:55,461 --> 00:50:58,100
to.
And only traveled out there for the next

1043
00:50:58,101 --> 00:50:59,900
demonstration.
And Lo and behold,

1044
00:50:59,901 --> 00:51:00,734
you've got thousands of police officers.
You've got water cannons and I'm German 

1045
00:51:03,771 --> 00:51:06,080
people were attacked with water cannons 
by the police.

1046
00:51:06,910 --> 00:51:07,743
So is the situation in Germany 
particularly precarious even though you 

1047
00:51:10,511 --> 00:51:12,700
mostly focused in the UK because that's 
where you're from.

1048
00:51:12,880 --> 00:51:13,713
I've heard a lot of people say that in 
Germany because of the guilt related to 

1049
00:51:17,021 --> 00:51:17,854
the Holocaust that they,
they feel as a nation a certain amount 

1050
00:51:21,161 --> 00:51:22,660
of guilt.
So when,

1051
00:51:22,690 --> 00:51:26,290
when these migrants and uh,
all these people want to come there,

1052
00:51:26,440 --> 00:51:29,290
they feel an extra need,
uh,

1053
00:51:29,350 --> 00:51:31,390
to help them.
And because of that,

1054
00:51:31,391 --> 00:51:33,670
that's why Merkel let in the whatever it
is,

1055
00:51:33,671 --> 00:51:34,504
I think it's one point 2 million people 
and that even when they do violent acts 

1056
00:51:38,740 --> 00:51:39,573
as a society,
they're more condoning of it because 

1057
00:51:42,341 --> 00:51:45,730
they know that their ancestors have done
some pretty horrible stuff.

1058
00:51:46,270 --> 00:51:47,103
Well,
this generation of Germans seem to be 

1059
00:51:48,591 --> 00:51:52,100
living with and suffering from guilt 
from Hitler.

1060
00:51:52,670 --> 00:51:55,860
The next generation of Germans will 
suffer and live with guilt from.

1061
00:51:55,880 --> 00:52:00,880
And so that's what I need to wake up to.
This generation.

1062
00:52:01,551 --> 00:52:04,550
Have nothing to feel guilty about.
They have a beautiful country,

1063
00:52:04,600 --> 00:52:07,040
a beautiful culture,
the envy of the world,

1064
00:52:07,290 --> 00:52:08,123
and they're beautiful people,
so civilized and decent people and they 

1065
00:52:12,261 --> 00:52:13,410
have nothing to feel good.
We also,

1066
00:52:13,540 --> 00:52:17,580
so what?
What this is is underestimation of,

1067
00:52:17,640 --> 00:52:19,700
of the culture and ideology.
They're allowing it.

1068
00:52:20,210 --> 00:52:23,900
That's what it is like if everyone's all
make him humanity responses,

1069
00:52:23,930 --> 00:52:27,380
we must help these people but not help 
them.

1070
00:52:27,410 --> 00:52:31,760
If it involves the destruction of your 
culture and your and your country,

1071
00:52:32,090 --> 00:52:32,923
not help them at the cost or the expense
of young German goes that and I'm all 

1072
00:52:37,311 --> 00:52:39,320
for helping refugees.
I just don't think they should be helped

1073
00:52:39,321 --> 00:52:40,070
in Europe.

1074
00:52:40,070 --> 00:52:41,480
I think they should be helped in the 
Middle East.

1075
00:52:41,660 --> 00:52:42,493
I think that we should be leading the 
way in funding and military support to 

1076
00:52:44,811 --> 00:52:45,644
make sure that there are buffer zones,
but I don't think they're important and 

1077
00:52:48,321 --> 00:52:51,160
to be honest,
by important one point 2 million this,

1078
00:52:51,190 --> 00:52:52,023
is she making any impact on the 
suffering of of refugees across the 

1079
00:52:55,550 --> 00:52:57,230
Middle East because there's tens of 
millions.

1080
00:52:58,340 --> 00:53:01,760
Whatever option is there bring bring the
whole of Syria into Europe.

1081
00:53:02,800 --> 00:53:05,990
It solves nothing is nothing and what 
she's actually done by doing this,

1082
00:53:05,991 --> 00:53:06,824
this,
she's opened up the flood gates and we 

1083
00:53:07,671 --> 00:53:08,504
will now see absolute stampedes of of 
tens of millions over the next five 

1084
00:53:11,211 --> 00:53:11,500
years.

1085
00:53:11,500 --> 00:53:12,333
Well,
I've also read a bunch on how it's not 

1086
00:53:13,601 --> 00:53:18,160
just about the violence,
but also just the actual system,

1087
00:53:18,161 --> 00:53:21,280
the systems that are in place.
The social systems.

1088
00:53:21,281 --> 00:53:22,114
You know,
I was reading something this morning 

1089
00:53:22,781 --> 00:53:26,130
about how all of these people that are 
coming from Syria,

1090
00:53:26,131 --> 00:53:26,880
they,
all,

1091
00:53:26,880 --> 00:53:28,950
a huge percent of them have really bad 
teeth.

1092
00:53:28,980 --> 00:53:29,813
Their teeth are really bad now they're 
going to get free dental coverage and 

1093
00:53:32,911 --> 00:53:33,744
it's going to cost something.
I sleep with something like a billion 

1094
00:53:35,431 --> 00:53:37,710
euros or something,
but they're not going to pay for it,

1095
00:53:37,711 --> 00:53:39,880
so the average German taxpayer is going 
to have,

1096
00:53:40,170 --> 00:53:42,240
have to pay for it and then that right 
there,

1097
00:53:42,241 --> 00:53:43,074
when their taxes go up,
then naturally they're going to be more 

1098
00:53:45,211 --> 00:53:46,630
resentful of these people.
So it's,

1099
00:53:46,800 --> 00:53:50,310
it's hitting people in the,
at the economic level and at the violent

1100
00:53:50,311 --> 00:53:52,590
level.
It just seems like a terrible mix.

1101
00:53:53,120 --> 00:53:54,030
A society.

1102
00:53:54,590 --> 00:53:55,423
It's going to hit them everywhere.
I believe 80 percent of them can't read 

1103
00:53:57,821 --> 00:53:58,654
or write.
I believe the many of the real refugees 

1104
00:54:01,631 --> 00:54:04,240
that have come from Syria are going to 
be suffering from PTSD,

1105
00:54:04,490 --> 00:54:06,430
post traumatic stress,
stress disorder.

1106
00:54:06,710 --> 00:54:08,140
Um,
they're going to need counseling.

1107
00:54:08,141 --> 00:54:08,974
They're going to need help.
There's so many problems that will come 

1108
00:54:11,351 --> 00:54:14,410
from this and we say one point 2 
million,

1109
00:54:14,411 --> 00:54:16,690
but they were allowed to bring their 
families after for years.

1110
00:54:16,691 --> 00:54:17,524
Right?
And they're loud and they're allowed 

1111
00:54:17,981 --> 00:54:21,220
their EU passports.
So that one point two will become six or

1112
00:54:21,221 --> 00:54:23,800
eight.
It doesn't have the infrastructure.

1113
00:54:24,160 --> 00:54:24,993
I'm simply.
But what Angela Merkel was fully aware 

1114
00:54:26,981 --> 00:54:27,814
of is that they won't stay in Germany.
They're going to come to countries like 

1115
00:54:29,670 --> 00:54:30,940
mine.
She knows.

1116
00:54:31,360 --> 00:54:32,350
She knows.
And in fact,

1117
00:54:32,351 --> 00:54:33,184
just last week,
the German government have come out and 

1118
00:54:34,541 --> 00:54:38,260
said,
we've lost 600,000

1119
00:54:38,620 --> 00:54:40,540
refugee.
We've lost them asylum seekers.

1120
00:54:40,690 --> 00:54:41,523
We have lost them.
They're not where they said they 

1121
00:54:42,131 --> 00:54:45,210
weren't.
They've got now 600,000.

1122
00:54:45,580 --> 00:54:49,480
How many of them are rapists?
How many Isis fighters?

1123
00:54:49,750 --> 00:54:52,330
How many are criminals?
We have no idea.

1124
00:54:52,600 --> 00:54:53,620
No idea at all.

1125
00:54:54,160 --> 00:54:56,050
So let me ask you this,
because a lot of this,

1126
00:54:56,051 --> 00:54:56,884
you know,
at some level you hear the people 

1127
00:54:57,341 --> 00:54:58,174
throwing around the term Trojan horse a 
lot and a lot of it sort of sounds like 

1128
00:55:01,841 --> 00:55:02,674
a conspiracy that there has been this 
organized effort to just influx all 

1129
00:55:06,581 --> 00:55:07,414
these people.
And I think I've seen even in some of 

1130
00:55:08,831 --> 00:55:09,664
the videos that you've tweeted when you 
see just like hundreds or thousands of 

1131
00:55:13,151 --> 00:55:13,984
migrants crossing,
it does seem like it's 80 or 90 percent 

1132
00:55:17,021 --> 00:55:17,854
men.
Men that are 20 or 30 and you don't see 

1133
00:55:19,841 --> 00:55:20,674
a lot of women.
You see occasionally you'll see some 

1134
00:55:21,941 --> 00:55:24,190
women in some children,
but it does seem like a lot of men.

1135
00:55:24,550 --> 00:55:28,150
But to go that route,
it sounds like a conspiracy theory to go

1136
00:55:28,151 --> 00:55:28,751
and say,
oh,

1137
00:55:28,751 --> 00:55:29,584
this is.
There's an intentional plan to flood 

1138
00:55:31,571 --> 00:55:34,720
Europe with these people to ultimately 
take over.

1139
00:55:34,721 --> 00:55:37,450
But I suspect by the 15 minutes we've 
spent together,

1140
00:55:37,451 --> 00:55:38,770
you don't think it's much of a 
conspiracy.

1141
00:55:41,230 --> 00:55:42,063
That can be no other reason.
Anyone with any common sense and 

1142
00:55:44,351 --> 00:55:45,184
intelligence or brain can kind of look 
at what's happening and know it's not 

1143
00:55:47,741 --> 00:55:48,574
going to be good for Europe where anyone
can look up what's happening to Angela 

1144
00:55:51,700 --> 00:55:53,180
Merkel made comments such as,
um,

1145
00:55:53,470 --> 00:55:56,650
immigrants are more prone to violence 
and extremism than the non immigrant.

1146
00:55:56,651 --> 00:55:57,484
She,
she said that years ago she's also made 

1147
00:55:58,601 --> 00:56:00,330
comments saying that multiculturalism 
has failed.

1148
00:56:00,640 --> 00:56:03,520
They've already failed in integrate 
millions of Muslims.

1149
00:56:03,850 --> 00:56:08,850
So why is she bringing in millions more?
What reason?

1150
00:56:09,070 --> 00:56:11,830
If anyone can else can give a reason.
And how are these millions?

1151
00:56:12,010 --> 00:56:12,701
Well,
what do you think?

1152
00:56:12,701 --> 00:56:13,534
What do you think actually,
what do you think is going on in her 

1153
00:56:14,981 --> 00:56:17,650
head then?
If everything you've said here is true?

1154
00:56:17,950 --> 00:56:18,610
Angola,
Merkel,

1155
00:56:18,610 --> 00:56:20,020
she was just time.
Woman of the year,

1156
00:56:20,021 --> 00:56:20,960
right?
I mean this is a,

1157
00:56:21,020 --> 00:56:22,920
this is a bright lady,
right?

1158
00:56:22,980 --> 00:56:23,813
So what about

1159
00:56:24,320 --> 00:56:25,153
under Angela Merkel has no children that
she cares not for the future of our 

1160
00:56:28,241 --> 00:56:30,820
country or our people.
That's truthfully what I feel.

1161
00:56:30,821 --> 00:56:33,580
I don't think she cares about,
about the future of her people.

1162
00:56:34,420 --> 00:56:35,950
And at the same time,
you have this,

1163
00:56:36,310 --> 00:56:37,450
this,
as you said,

1164
00:56:37,451 --> 00:56:39,580
people holding up on a pedestal at 
first,

1165
00:56:39,610 --> 00:56:41,350
at first,
wherever it was for,

1166
00:56:41,770 --> 00:56:42,603
I can't say it was through ill intention
because I think they know that everyone 

1167
00:56:46,181 --> 00:56:47,014
knows full well what this is going to do
to Europe and we know full well what's 

1168
00:56:49,391 --> 00:56:52,540
going to happen and what you're seeing 
is actually the only countries in Europe

1169
00:56:52,570 --> 00:56:53,403
that are freely speaking honestly,
are the countries that don't have a I a 

1170
00:56:58,240 --> 00:57:01,270
high percentage of Muslims.
It's Poland,

1171
00:57:02,100 --> 00:57:05,050
it's hungry,
it's Czech Republic,

1172
00:57:05,130 --> 00:57:05,963
Slovakia.
They are political leaders are coming 

1173
00:57:07,271 --> 00:57:08,104
out and saying what needs to be said now
if you look at the UK is former 

1174
00:57:10,481 --> 00:57:11,260
political leaders.

1175
00:57:11,260 --> 00:57:14,650
If you look at Sir William Gladstone,
he held the Koran above his head.

1176
00:57:15,070 --> 00:57:15,903
He in parliament and he said that Islam,
there's this Koran is a violent and a 

1177
00:57:19,481 --> 00:57:22,390
curse book and we will never be have 
peace on this earth.

1178
00:57:22,391 --> 00:57:25,750
So long as we have this book.
Winston Churchill said,

1179
00:57:26,020 --> 00:57:28,900
the individual Muslims will show amazing
characteristics,

1180
00:57:29,170 --> 00:57:30,003
but the backwardness of Islam has the 
power to bring Europe back to the dark 

1181
00:57:32,771 --> 00:57:34,810
ages.
Now there are two world leaders,

1182
00:57:34,820 --> 00:57:36,970
we have statues that the whole world 
loved,

1183
00:57:37,450 --> 00:57:38,283
and if they were around today,
they will be called bigots and 

1184
00:57:40,421 --> 00:57:43,240
extremists and that simply for telling 
the truth,

1185
00:57:43,570 --> 00:57:45,520
my prime minister,
prime minister,

1186
00:57:45,521 --> 00:57:46,354
says that Islam is a religion of peace 
and the facts speak very different to 

1187
00:57:50,231 --> 00:57:53,350
that.
And at the moment the problem we have is

1188
00:57:53,351 --> 00:57:54,184
that by telling the truth,
which even if people don't like the 

1189
00:57:57,851 --> 00:57:59,800
truth,
we have to be honest.

1190
00:58:00,010 --> 00:58:00,740
I

1191
00:58:00,740 --> 00:58:01,573
so think when people say Islam is a 
religion of peace or Christianity's 

1192
00:58:03,591 --> 00:58:05,900
originally piece or Judaism is a 
religion of peace,

1193
00:58:05,930 --> 00:58:07,130
it's a moot point.
Uh,

1194
00:58:07,131 --> 00:58:09,740
religion is because of religion is only 
a set of ideas.

1195
00:58:10,070 --> 00:58:13,250
All the religion is,
is what it's adherence do,

1196
00:58:13,340 --> 00:58:16,070
right?
It's a religion of peace that that means

1197
00:58:16,071 --> 00:58:18,860
nothing.
That an idea is what people do with it.

1198
00:58:19,130 --> 00:58:19,963
So I find those statements like that 
just don't add anything to the 

1199
00:58:22,281 --> 00:58:23,114
conversation.

1200
00:58:23,940 --> 00:58:24,773
No.
And we hear them after every terrorist 

1201
00:58:25,881 --> 00:58:27,570
attack,
every single terrorist.

1202
00:58:27,760 --> 00:58:28,620
That's what,
that's what we,

1203
00:58:28,800 --> 00:58:30,120
that's what we talked.
And in fact,

1204
00:58:30,121 --> 00:58:32,370
it's not what we're talking about.
I'll give it to other circumstances.

1205
00:58:32,371 --> 00:58:33,700
Now as a parent,
as that,

1206
00:58:34,620 --> 00:58:35,453
I was studying the biography of Mohammed
and I'm sat at home and I'm preparing 

1207
00:58:39,661 --> 00:58:43,260
for a debate and my daughter who is 
eight years old,

1208
00:58:43,261 --> 00:58:45,220
she walked past me and said,
[inaudible],

1209
00:58:45,240 --> 00:58:47,190
I don't,
I never taught my children.

1210
00:58:47,191 --> 00:58:50,010
They think my kids never heard of the 
English Defense League.

1211
00:58:50,070 --> 00:58:53,040
Yeah.
I lived two very separate lives and I,

1212
00:58:53,041 --> 00:58:53,874
I want to protect them for as long as 
possible from understanding these 

1213
00:58:55,861 --> 00:58:57,990
politics.
Daughter walked past and said,

1214
00:58:57,991 --> 00:58:59,070
Mohammed,
peace be upon him.

1215
00:59:00,450 --> 00:59:01,283
And I looked and I said,
what did you just say and why did you 

1216
00:59:03,901 --> 00:59:05,460
just say that?
And she said,

1217
00:59:05,461 --> 00:59:06,151
well,
it's taught at school.

1218
00:59:06,151 --> 00:59:07,230
You have to say peace be upon him.

1219
00:59:08,230 --> 00:59:10,250
Said peace be upon him.
And then,

1220
00:59:10,270 --> 00:59:14,460
and that was one incident.
Then another incident about a mosque.

1221
00:59:14,461 --> 00:59:17,070
And then when I took my children to look
at another school,

1222
00:59:17,920 --> 00:59:19,340
um,
one of the things that,

1223
00:59:19,350 --> 00:59:20,183
one of the things they had to do was put
the different religious buildings with 

1224
00:59:22,611 --> 00:59:24,050
the different religious words.
Yeah.

1225
00:59:24,530 --> 00:59:29,330
The only one my daughter could do the 
religions of the world was his mom.

1226
00:59:30,080 --> 00:59:30,913
Because what's happening now in the 
national curriculum in the UK is that 

1227
00:59:33,801 --> 00:59:34,634
Islam is the favorite religion.
Islam is what's being pushed and 

1228
00:59:36,870 --> 00:59:37,703
propagates all of our youth and children
and they're brainwashing either mind if 

1229
00:59:41,061 --> 00:59:43,280
they want to talk about Mohammed,
tell the truth,

1230
00:59:43,820 --> 00:59:46,370
tell us about the man or he was not a 
man of peace.

1231
00:59:46,371 --> 00:59:48,940
Some of the things he'd done with some 
such immoral thing.

1232
00:59:49,010 --> 00:59:50,390
No,
he killed a lot of people.

1233
00:59:51,060 --> 00:59:52,120
That's a fact.

1234
00:59:52,480 --> 00:59:54,310
It's a fact,
but they're not teaching that.

1235
00:59:54,610 --> 00:59:56,410
They're teaching this.
This is great man.

1236
00:59:56,680 --> 00:59:57,910
This great man,
Mohammed,

1237
00:59:58,150 --> 01:00:00,100
that we must all respect and say,
peace be upon him.

1238
01:00:00,640 --> 01:00:02,920
That's what they're teaching.
Eight year old English go children.

1239
01:00:03,160 --> 01:00:05,710
So then by the time that next generation
come out at the schools,

1240
01:00:05,950 --> 01:00:10,210
there been brainwashed into this mindset
and as soon as your parents even.

1241
01:00:10,211 --> 01:00:11,044
I've seen it across the country,
parents who have not wanted their 

1242
01:00:13,121 --> 01:00:16,090
children to be taught these things and 
then branded as racist as well.

1243
01:00:16,350 --> 01:00:18,340
I moved for the truth being taught to my
kids,

1244
01:00:18,610 --> 01:00:19,443
but then I haven't even spoke to my 
children if I haven't spoke to our 

1245
01:00:23,051 --> 01:00:23,884
children about Islam.
Are All one school talking to him about 

1246
01:00:26,491 --> 01:00:26,740
it?

1247
01:00:26,740 --> 01:00:27,573
Well,
that's one of the strange things and I 

1248
01:00:28,270 --> 01:00:31,450
think we see this a little bit in 
America where they'll say,

1249
01:00:31,451 --> 01:00:32,284
well,
we need to learn more about Islam 

1250
01:00:33,521 --> 01:00:34,354
because of this.
And to me it's like we should not be 

1251
01:00:36,551 --> 01:00:37,384
learning more about Islam.
We should not be learning more about 

1252
01:00:38,831 --> 01:00:39,664
Christianity.
We should not be learning more about 

1253
01:00:41,020 --> 01:00:43,450
Judaism or mormonism or jainism or any 
of them.

1254
01:00:43,451 --> 01:00:46,420
What we should be learning about our 
secular values.

1255
01:00:46,540 --> 01:00:49,180
We should be learning about the things 
that tie us together.

1256
01:00:49,450 --> 01:00:52,750
Not all the little differences that are 
just gonna split us.

1257
01:00:53,260 --> 01:00:55,350
I,
I'm completely in agreement.

1258
01:00:55,351 --> 01:00:56,184
It's just a fundamental problem.
I always say that I believe in secular 

1259
01:00:59,311 --> 01:01:00,870
schools.
I think we should have secular schools,

1260
01:01:00,871 --> 01:01:02,550
but they're not.
I don't believe we should also,

1261
01:01:03,070 --> 01:01:05,790
um,
I don't believe that shouldn't pose,

1262
01:01:05,820 --> 01:01:09,810
pose a problem for,
for safe schools or schools or Christian

1263
01:01:09,811 --> 01:01:12,810
schools because because they're not 
causing us the problems that we face.

1264
01:01:13,140 --> 01:01:15,810
These huge problems that we face 
currently are caused by Islam.

1265
01:01:15,840 --> 01:01:16,673
They're inspired by Islam.
And if they want to sit in schools and 

1266
01:01:18,901 --> 01:01:20,620
talk about Mohammed,
they need to tell them that he,

1267
01:01:20,650 --> 01:01:21,870
he,
he raped a child,

1268
01:01:21,871 --> 01:01:23,970
he married a child,
he committed murder,

1269
01:01:24,130 --> 01:01:26,100
that they didn't need to tell the truth 
and they're not.

1270
01:01:26,101 --> 01:01:26,934
So then we have this complete ward down 
educational system that is lying to the 

1271
01:01:29,821 --> 01:01:31,200
next generation of youth in the UK.

1272
01:01:31,600 --> 01:01:32,610
Yeah.
Um,

1273
01:01:32,700 --> 01:01:33,533
all right.
Well we have to wrap up and I feel like 

1274
01:01:34,840 --> 01:01:35,673
there's so much more we could talk about
and hopefully with the way I prefaced 

1275
01:01:38,740 --> 01:01:42,580
this whole episode,
people will learn about you and they can

1276
01:01:42,581 --> 01:01:44,290
make the decisions,
you know,

1277
01:01:44,350 --> 01:01:45,183
whether they think you're a racist or 
whether they think you're preaching the 

1278
01:01:48,851 --> 01:01:50,570
truth or somewhere in between.
Uh,

1279
01:01:50,650 --> 01:01:52,250
but just to wrap up,
um,

1280
01:01:52,710 --> 01:01:56,800
give me something that you think,
give me some hope here.

1281
01:01:56,980 --> 01:01:57,880
Give me some hope.
I mean,

1282
01:01:57,881 --> 01:01:58,714
you're working with piggy now.
It doesn't sound like a hate 

1283
01:02:00,941 --> 01:02:01,774
organization to me.
So give me some hope for an ability to 

1284
01:02:04,631 --> 01:02:07,210
turn some of this around.
And first and coexistence

1285
01:02:07,840 --> 01:02:11,720
Europe is you can end up hugely the 
people of Europe.

1286
01:02:11,960 --> 01:02:15,170
You have just seen a declaration called 
the fortress Europe,

1287
01:02:15,171 --> 01:02:16,004
which is called the product declaration,
which for in different countries now 

1288
01:02:19,171 --> 01:02:20,004
have assigned to you on the sixth of 
February for the first time there's 

1289
01:02:22,891 --> 01:02:27,810
going to be demonstrations in England,
in Holland and Denmark in Germany,

1290
01:02:27,870 --> 01:02:31,680
and the Czech Republic in Poland all 
simultaneously at the same time.

1291
01:02:31,950 --> 01:02:36,950
This is the star of a friendship and 
partnership has been not just Europe,

1292
01:02:37,201 --> 01:02:38,910
actually,
Australia also marching with us.

1293
01:02:38,911 --> 01:02:40,710
We hope that by the next time we have 
America,

1294
01:02:40,860 --> 01:02:42,780
we have Canada,
we have India,

1295
01:02:42,970 --> 01:02:46,140
we have the world because this is a 
worldwide problem we have to face.

1296
01:02:46,380 --> 01:02:47,460
And um,
yeah,

1297
01:02:47,490 --> 01:02:49,540
there is hope and they'll always be hope
because to be honest,

1298
01:02:49,740 --> 01:02:50,573
I know whole heartedly that our love for
freedom and democracy will always 

1299
01:02:53,641 --> 01:02:54,590
outweigh their,
their,

1300
01:02:54,610 --> 01:02:56,330
their hatred for Sharia.

1301
01:02:56,690 --> 01:02:57,400
Yeah.
Alright,

1302
01:02:57,400 --> 01:02:59,800
well listen,
it was really interesting talking to you

1303
01:02:59,801 --> 01:03:01,510
and I'm sure we'll,
we'll keep talking,

1304
01:03:02,410 --> 01:03:05,560
but I was going to send people to Amazon
to buy your book,

1305
01:03:05,800 --> 01:03:08,200
but Amazon took your book off,
didn't they?

1306
01:03:08,830 --> 01:03:10,990
They took it off and put it back up 
three times.

1307
01:03:11,230 --> 01:03:13,240
Right?
So I'm not sure if it's up right now,

1308
01:03:13,241 --> 01:03:17,680
but they can definitely get your book at
Tommy Robinson Dot Co dot UK,

1309
01:03:17,770 --> 01:03:22,570
and they can get the kindle version at 
least in America yet on Amazon.

1310
01:03:23,040 --> 01:03:23,980
Yeah.
Uh,

1311
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:24,833
all right.
Well it was a pleasure talking to you 

1312
01:03:26,430 --> 01:03:27,610
and uh,
you know,

1313
01:03:27,611 --> 01:03:28,444
it's difficult stuff,
but that's why we have to have these 

1314
01:03:29,681 --> 01:03:32,230
conversations.
So I thank you for coming on.
