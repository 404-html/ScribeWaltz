1
00:00:05,090 --> 00:00:06,950
Let's go all the way back to one of my 
favorite years,

2
00:00:06,951 --> 00:00:09,350
1985,
and talk about Russia today.

3
00:00:09,470 --> 00:00:12,890
There's so much happening in the news 
lately with this giant country,

4
00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:15,980
but since we're all in election mode 
here in the United States,

5
00:00:15,981 --> 00:00:19,520
pretty much all the time,
most of the news about Russia is getting

6
00:00:19,521 --> 00:00:21,790
completely lost and there's a bunch 
going on.

7
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:22,993
First.
There's the ongoing war with Russia in 

8
00:00:24,801 --> 00:00:25,634
Syria,
which has become the deadliest conflict 

9
00:00:27,710 --> 00:00:32,000
since World War II.
It's estimated that over 400,000

10
00:00:32,001 --> 00:00:36,050
people have died so far,
and sadly it seems that there's no light

11
00:00:36,051 --> 00:00:36,884
at the end of the tunnel.
Then there's the rumors that wikileaks 

12
00:00:39,410 --> 00:00:40,243
is somehow working with the Russian 
government to influence our election 

13
00:00:43,011 --> 00:00:43,844
right here.
This is become a big talking point in 

14
00:00:45,531 --> 00:00:46,364
democratic circles as wikileaks 
continues to drop information about 

15
00:00:49,341 --> 00:00:52,730
Hillary Clinton,
emails and Clinton Foundation donors,

16
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,130
even Julian Assan,
Wiki leaks,

17
00:00:55,131 --> 00:00:55,964
editor in chief is promising more 
October surprises and clearly they're 

18
00:00:59,601 --> 00:01:04,400
not going to be aimed at helping hilary 
or the Democrats on top of those issues.

19
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:08,030
There's a lot of other reasons to 
believe that Vladimir Putin sees America

20
00:01:08,031 --> 00:01:11,960
in retreat around the world and he's 
looking to fill that void.

21
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:17,180
Russia is occupied Ukraine for two years
now and it's clear that Russia is making

22
00:01:17,181 --> 00:01:19,640
moves throughout Syria without us 
approval.

23
00:01:19,790 --> 00:01:22,520
Sometimes indirect conflict with 
American goals,

24
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:26,690
although it's completely unclear to me 
what exactly those American goals are.

25
00:01:27,290 --> 00:01:30,860
Only four years ago in America's last 
presidential election,

26
00:01:30,861 --> 00:01:31,694
Mitt Romney was widely mocked for 
calling Russia without question our 

27
00:01:35,601 --> 00:01:36,434
number one geopolitical foe,
and yet now it seems that it's the 

28
00:01:39,801 --> 00:01:40,634
Democrats who are leaning more hawkish 
on Russia just listened to hillary or 

29
00:01:43,941 --> 00:01:44,774
Tim Kaine and the debate so far,
the democratic nominees are much more 

30
00:01:47,691 --> 00:01:48,524
anti Russia then either trump or pence.
Is trump to close to Putin or does he 

31
00:01:52,791 --> 00:01:54,830
have other Russian business interests in
mind?

32
00:01:55,070 --> 00:01:59,120
I guess that's possible too.
There could be a new cold war brewing,

33
00:01:59,121 --> 00:02:02,180
but this time there may not be a rocky 
Balboa verse.

34
00:02:02,210 --> 00:02:06,980
Ivan Drago boxing match on Christmas Day
in Mascoutah help us work things out.

35
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:11,600
While I don't think there's any 
legitimate reason that a direct conflict

36
00:02:11,601 --> 00:02:12,434
with Russia is on the way,
I do think it's important that we start 

37
00:02:14,901 --> 00:02:15,734
talking about are deeply complex 
relationship with Russia in an open and 

38
00:02:19,251 --> 00:02:22,850
honest way,
not just by demonizing and making fun of

39
00:02:22,851 --> 00:02:24,170
Putin,
which don't get me wrong,

40
00:02:24,171 --> 00:02:28,340
he makes it very easy to do,
but by really understanding what's going

41
00:02:28,341 --> 00:02:32,840
on within Russia and the geopolitical 
circumstances which have led us to where

42
00:02:32,841 --> 00:02:35,780
we are now.
If we don't do a little homework now,

43
00:02:35,810 --> 00:02:40,810
then we'll all be easily manipulated by 
both politicians as well as by the media

44
00:02:41,300 --> 00:02:45,440
that has their own goals in mind.
Boogie men are a lot less scary when you

45
00:02:45,441 --> 00:02:46,274
know a little bit about them.
My guest this week is author and 

46
00:02:48,051 --> 00:02:51,080
columnist Cathy Young.
Kathy grew up in Russia until the age of

47
00:02:51,081 --> 00:02:53,210
16 when she moved to the United States.

48
00:02:53,210 --> 00:02:55,850
She's written for the New York Times,
The Washington Post,

49
00:02:55,851 --> 00:02:59,000
the Wall Street Journal,
as well as my hometown newspaper.

50
00:02:59,830 --> 00:03:01,930
She focuses on some of my favorite 
topics,

51
00:03:01,931 --> 00:03:04,240
including political correctness and free
speech,

52
00:03:04,510 --> 00:03:05,343
and from what I've seen,
she equally calls out the bad elements 

53
00:03:07,691 --> 00:03:10,360
of both the regressive left and the alt 
right.

54
00:03:10,780 --> 00:03:11,613
She's also been an outspoken critic of 
modern feminism and a defender of the 

55
00:03:14,381 --> 00:03:15,214
men's rights movement.
Those she sees some issues with that 

56
00:03:17,621 --> 00:03:19,090
movement as well.
I've you,

57
00:03:19,091 --> 00:03:19,924
Cathy,
is one of the few people really trying 

58
00:03:21,341 --> 00:03:22,174
to take both sides to task and give both
sides a chance before forming her own 

59
00:03:26,441 --> 00:03:31,441
opinions all the while not being too 
attached to a specific ideology,

60
00:03:32,290 --> 00:03:33,123
not being locked into a specific 
ideology and being intellectually 

61
00:03:36,311 --> 00:03:37,144
flexible is one of the most important 
attributes you can have and one that I 

62
00:03:39,941 --> 00:03:44,440
consistently strive to have for myself.
The last few months had been interesting

63
00:03:44,441 --> 00:03:45,274
as we've seen many never trump.
Republicans slowly fall in line to a 

64
00:03:48,671 --> 00:03:49,504
lesser degree.
We've seen it with the Bernie Bros who 

65
00:03:50,831 --> 00:03:53,770
seemed far less inclined to go all in 
for Hillary.

66
00:03:54,070 --> 00:03:54,903
The wider point here though,
is that everyone is making their own 

67
00:03:57,461 --> 00:04:01,210
calculations and decisions based on the 
information around them.

68
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:03,460
The key,
no matter what you believe,

69
00:04:03,461 --> 00:04:04,294
is to have access to new ideas and 
concepts and to have conversations 

70
00:04:07,901 --> 00:04:10,990
that'll either enforce your beliefs or 
change them for the better.

71
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:19,500
My guest this week is an author and 
columnist who's written for the New York

72
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:20,333
Times and Wall Street Journal and is a 
regular contributor to reason and my 

73
00:04:23,191 --> 00:04:25,200
hometown newspaper,
Newsday,

74
00:04:25,290 --> 00:04:26,123
Cathy Young.
Welcome to the Rubin report and it's 

75
00:04:27,421 --> 00:04:29,700
great to be here.
I am very excited.

76
00:04:29,730 --> 00:04:31,320
That was your hometown.
That is.

77
00:04:31,321 --> 00:04:34,950
I am a long islander.
Born in Brooklyn.

78
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:37,830
Grew up in long island,
lived in New York City my whole life.

79
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:40,590
Now here I am in La.
You're a Jersey girl though,

80
00:04:40,591 --> 00:04:41,640
right?
I am.

81
00:04:41,641 --> 00:04:42,474
Well,
I am originally from Russia yet we're 

82
00:04:44,161 --> 00:04:44,994
going to get into that,
but I have been a jersey girl since 

83
00:04:48,121 --> 00:04:52,020
1981,
so it has actually been a while.

84
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:54,480
That sounds like a book right there.
From Jersey.

85
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:56,790
From Russia to Germany.
Russia to Jersey.

86
00:04:56,791 --> 00:04:57,624
Well,
I did write a book called growing up in 

87
00:04:58,771 --> 00:04:59,604
Moscow,
which was my first book came out in 89 

88
00:05:02,550 --> 00:05:04,380
when I was fresh out of college.

89
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:06,300
So yeah.
Well,

90
00:05:06,301 --> 00:05:07,840
that's exactly where I want to start.
So,

91
00:05:08,220 --> 00:05:09,053
so,
well done.

92
00:05:09,090 --> 00:05:10,710
Okay.
So in my direct message,

93
00:05:10,711 --> 00:05:14,610
I talked a bit about Russia and I have a
sense that in the next month or so we're

94
00:05:14,611 --> 00:05:18,000
going to be hearing a lot more about 
Russia between what's going on in Syria,

95
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:19,840
people,
you know,

96
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:20,753
talking about the Wiki leaks stuff and 
is there somehow a connection that they 

97
00:05:23,431 --> 00:05:25,260
want to take down?
Hillary does,

98
00:05:25,261 --> 00:05:26,094
right?
Does trump have a business ties to 

99
00:05:28,231 --> 00:05:29,280
Russia?
All of this stuff.

100
00:05:29,580 --> 00:05:33,450
So let's go back to your first 16 years.
What was it like growing up,

101
00:05:33,540 --> 00:05:36,090
uh,
in Russia and uh,

102
00:05:36,150 --> 00:05:37,650
if you don't want to give me your exact 
age,

103
00:05:37,651 --> 00:05:41,640
give me a rough estimate of the years 
that he was born in 1965.

104
00:05:41,660 --> 00:05:42,660
Okay.
You never,

105
00:05:42,670 --> 00:05:44,210
you never know.
Yeah,

106
00:05:44,250 --> 00:05:45,660
I'm,
I'm fine with that.

107
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:46,141
Yeah.
All right.

108
00:05:46,141 --> 00:05:48,450
So let's talk about it.
Talk about growing up in Russia.

109
00:05:48,470 --> 00:05:49,303
So yeah,
I was growing up in the president of a 

110
00:05:51,061 --> 00:05:56,061
years and it was interesting because at 
the time it really seemed like the,

111
00:05:57,500 --> 00:05:58,310
that existed

112
00:05:58,310 --> 00:06:01,520
at the time was really forever.
Um,

113
00:06:01,580 --> 00:06:03,710
and it was funny because,
uh,

114
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:05,580
there was a book,
uh,

115
00:06:05,630 --> 00:06:10,630
by Russian dissident named Andrea Mora,
called Willis Soviet Union existed until

116
00:06:10,701 --> 00:06:14,890
1984 and he picked that day because of 
Orwell,

117
00:06:14,900 --> 00:06:18,590
of course.
And it's so bizarre because at the time,

118
00:06:18,610 --> 00:06:20,060
uh,
I heard about this book,

119
00:06:20,061 --> 00:06:21,650
you know,
my father was a kind of,

120
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:22,513
well,
both my parents were really kind of 

121
00:06:23,481 --> 00:06:27,800
closet dissidents and we had banned 
literature on the house.

122
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:29,970
Um,
and what was bad,

123
00:06:30,260 --> 00:06:32,110
what type of literature was actually 
banned.

124
00:06:32,130 --> 00:06:34,390
Oh,
anything that was critical of,

125
00:06:34,470 --> 00:06:37,130
uh,
of the Soviet system social needs.

126
00:06:37,131 --> 00:06:41,310
And of course the works of dissidents.
Um,

127
00:06:41,370 --> 00:06:43,000
there were,
uh,

128
00:06:43,810 --> 00:06:46,580
there is her,
we're not even really formally banned,

129
00:06:46,581 --> 00:06:49,670
but kind of really frowned upon,
um,

130
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:50,900
from,
uh,

131
00:06:50,901 --> 00:06:51,734
the early years of the Soviet regime,
like people who were executed for being 

132
00:06:56,300 --> 00:07:01,000
a sort of an opposition.
I'm war.

133
00:07:01,030 --> 00:07:02,450
Well,
of course was done.

134
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:05,120
Uh,
I didn't actually get to read it until I

135
00:07:05,121 --> 00:07:08,060
had left the Soviet Union.
And,

136
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:08,913
uh,
it's interesting because a number of 

137
00:07:09,861 --> 00:07:10,880
people who read or,
uh,

138
00:07:10,881 --> 00:07:11,760
well,
uh,

139
00:07:11,790 --> 00:07:13,700
in the,
it was called Samas dot,

140
00:07:13,701 --> 00:07:14,534
you know,
these typewritten leaflets that were 

141
00:07:19,100 --> 00:07:19,933
kind of passed around from person to 
person underground of people who read 

142
00:07:23,330 --> 00:07:24,163
world who read or,
and sort of smuggled in for an to a lot 

143
00:07:28,881 --> 00:07:29,714
of people in the Soviet Union really 
were shocked to learn that orwell had 

144
00:07:32,931 --> 00:07:37,610
never actually been to the Soviet Union.
Some of them were sure that we're,

145
00:07:37,611 --> 00:07:40,010
well,
like George Orwell must've been like the

146
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:40,873
pen name for our Russian emigre because 
who else could have understood the 

147
00:07:43,671 --> 00:07:46,820
system so well?
Yeah,

148
00:07:46,970 --> 00:07:47,900
he did.
Yeah.

149
00:07:47,901 --> 00:07:51,710
And the sort of the,
the pressure of,

150
00:07:51,711 --> 00:07:52,544
uh,
the pressure to conform to the dominant 

151
00:07:54,621 --> 00:07:57,440
ideology.
So anyway,

152
00:07:57,441 --> 00:07:58,010
yes.
So,

153
00:07:58,010 --> 00:07:58,843
uh,
Andre Amalric who picked that date 

154
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:03,050
because of,
uh,

155
00:08:03,260 --> 00:08:04,910
the book 1984,
of course.

156
00:08:05,210 --> 00:08:07,490
And at the time when I first started 
that it,

157
00:08:08,230 --> 00:08:09,063
I didn't,
no one could really imagine that this 

158
00:08:11,541 --> 00:08:12,374
would sort of come true because it 
actually doesn't exist that long passed 

159
00:08:15,550 --> 00:08:16,880
the 1984,
you know,

160
00:08:16,881 --> 00:08:21,440
he was off by 70 years.
That's when I was growing up,

161
00:08:21,441 --> 00:08:22,274
no one really could have imagined that 
and I think that's kind of a useful 

162
00:08:25,671 --> 00:08:29,930
thing to keep in mind when we think of 
today's events in the sense that,

163
00:08:29,931 --> 00:08:30,764
you know,
we really have no idea whatsoever what 

164
00:08:33,321 --> 00:08:35,810
the world is going to look like in five,
six,

165
00:08:35,811 --> 00:08:39,680
seven years.
Things are really unpredictable.

166
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:40,713
They really are.
And that's why I did the direct message 

167
00:08:43,610 --> 00:08:46,910
because I want people to have some 
knowledge about some of this stuff.

168
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:49,420
So the second we start hearing about 
this,

169
00:08:49,421 --> 00:08:52,850
I know we're not all caught guard and 
have no cancer,

170
00:08:52,910 --> 00:08:55,440
but you know,
in terms of what it was like to grow up,

171
00:08:55,460 --> 00:08:56,131
uh,
in,

172
00:08:56,131 --> 00:08:57,180
in the Soviet Union.

173
00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:00,570
And it's really difficult to answer on 
one word because,

174
00:09:00,590 --> 00:09:01,920
um,
you know,

175
00:09:01,980 --> 00:09:04,800
it wasn't in many ways it was a complex 
society.

176
00:09:04,801 --> 00:09:08,880
It was not the same as,
it wasn't in Stalin era where,

177
00:09:08,910 --> 00:09:09,743
you know,
it really was kind of back down the 

178
00:09:11,281 --> 00:09:13,170
height of the totalitarian.
Um,

179
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:15,930
when you know,
very little,

180
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:16,793
uh,
information or content as we would say 

181
00:09:18,991 --> 00:09:22,530
today,
was allowed to kind of seep in.

182
00:09:22,531 --> 00:09:26,460
That was not thoroughly filtered through
the official ideology.

183
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:28,530
I'm like,
at the time,

184
00:09:28,531 --> 00:09:29,580
for instance,
uh,

185
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:31,180
back in the thirties and,
you know,

186
00:09:31,300 --> 00:09:34,900
even the,
even the fifties a dusty yefsky was bad.

187
00:09:35,940 --> 00:09:36,750
Maybe not,
again,

188
00:09:36,750 --> 00:09:37,583
not officially banned,
but very difficult to get and certainly 

189
00:09:40,141 --> 00:09:42,750
wasn't studied in schools and colleges.
Uh,

190
00:09:42,751 --> 00:09:47,751
by the time that I was in a high school 
in Russia,

191
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:50,550
we actually had a prime and punishment 
on the curriculum.

192
00:09:50,770 --> 00:09:51,930
Um,
and,

193
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:52,630
you know,
we,

194
00:09:52,630 --> 00:09:57,120
the things that mentioned religion were 
kind of allowed a,

195
00:09:58,770 --> 00:09:59,603
anything that really was not very 
overtly critical of the Soviet Union 

196
00:10:03,330 --> 00:10:04,163
was,
okay,

197
00:10:04,250 --> 00:10:09,250
well Dr Chicago for instance,
but I did have the experience of um,

198
00:10:11,190 --> 00:10:12,023
you know,
growing up in a situation where when I 

199
00:10:14,521 --> 00:10:15,354
was maybe seven or eight years old,
but I started going to school and I 

200
00:10:18,121 --> 00:10:19,620
started coming home and saying,
oh,

201
00:10:19,621 --> 00:10:21,510
well,
we live in the best country in the world

202
00:10:21,511 --> 00:10:22,680
because we have communism.

203
00:10:22,830 --> 00:10:26,820
That was when my parents decided that 
they kind of had to explain to me that,

204
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:27,601
you know,
not,

205
00:10:27,601 --> 00:10:29,960
not really,
that is not really quick.

206
00:10:30,010 --> 00:10:34,860
Can do some of those leaflets that were 
going around the age of seven,

207
00:10:34,861 --> 00:10:35,694
but they just kind of talked to me and 
kind of gave me a little bit of an 

208
00:10:38,491 --> 00:10:41,130
explanation of what was what.
And uh,

209
00:10:41,580 --> 00:10:42,413
um,
and I remember very well my mother 

210
00:10:45,751 --> 00:10:46,810
telling me,
you know,

211
00:10:46,850 --> 00:10:50,400
he really,
you cannot tell anyone at school what we

212
00:10:50,401 --> 00:10:54,660
talk about at home because otherwise you
will go to jail.

213
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:57,660
And I'm not even sure that they would 
have because again,

214
00:10:57,661 --> 00:10:58,890
at the time,
you know,

215
00:10:58,891 --> 00:11:02,910
things were a little more flexible and 
open that they used to be.

216
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:05,580
Um,
I actually know of a situation,

217
00:11:05,660 --> 00:11:06,493
a friends of my parents that they are 
sudden started talking in kindergarten 

218
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:11,550
about how,
you know,

219
00:11:11,551 --> 00:11:12,384
he,
his dad was saying that Lennon was 

220
00:11:14,701 --> 00:11:17,790
really not the greatest person who ever 
lived.

221
00:11:19,470 --> 00:11:21,220
And um,
and nothing.

222
00:11:21,410 --> 00:11:22,243
But actually he has one of the teachers,
one of the kindergarten teachers called 

223
00:11:26,251 --> 00:11:29,460
that his mom and said and basically 
said,

224
00:11:29,461 --> 00:11:30,294
you know what?
I don't really care what you talk about 

225
00:11:31,860 --> 00:11:32,940
at home,
but you know,

226
00:11:32,941 --> 00:11:36,340
please don't do it in front of the kid 
because you don't know who else is going

227
00:11:36,341 --> 00:11:37,174
to tell us.
And she was pretty a pretty enlightened 

228
00:11:39,770 --> 00:11:40,603
for the teacher.
But in this society there was a lot of 

229
00:11:44,420 --> 00:11:48,690
kind of flexibility under the radar,
so to speak.

230
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:53,960
But officially it was all very conform 
as we had to at school.

231
00:11:55,060 --> 00:11:55,893
We had to attend these mandatory 
meetings where everyone had to kind of 

232
00:11:59,921 --> 00:12:02,300
repeat the slogans and,
you know,

233
00:12:02,790 --> 00:12:05,110
uh,
sing the praises of the Soviet Union.

234
00:12:05,111 --> 00:12:09,430
And this is actually one reason that a 
lot of the stuff that was going on today

235
00:12:09,431 --> 00:12:13,510
in American universities really 
resonates with me because,

236
00:12:13,511 --> 00:12:15,310
you know,
I've been saying to my mom,

237
00:12:15,311 --> 00:12:17,500
my dad passed away two years ago 
unfortunately.

238
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:19,390
But I've been saying to my mom,
you know,

239
00:12:19,391 --> 00:12:22,150
this really feels like the Soviet Union 
where they heard you.

240
00:12:22,151 --> 00:12:22,984
And so these meetings where you have to 
sit there and say all the right things 

241
00:12:26,860 --> 00:12:30,040
and it's not just that you're not 
allowed to say,

242
00:12:30,220 --> 00:12:32,900
you know,
things you're not allowed to say is that

243
00:12:32,980 --> 00:12:33,813
it's not.
You have to say the things you're 

244
00:12:35,620 --> 00:12:37,780
supposed to say,
which is,

245
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:39,110
well,
as I'm listening,

246
00:12:39,140 --> 00:12:41,440
I mean,
I absolutely see that through line.

247
00:12:41,441 --> 00:12:44,750
I'm not saying because,
you know,

248
00:12:44,770 --> 00:12:47,080
we're not,
no one gets hurt into the gulag,

249
00:12:47,081 --> 00:12:47,914
you know,
their resident.

250
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:48,910
Because I mean,
again,

251
00:12:48,911 --> 00:12:51,790
when I was growing up,
I did know that he could,

252
00:12:51,970 --> 00:12:54,030
you know,
it wasn't very likely maybe,

253
00:12:54,031 --> 00:12:56,970
but you could go to prison,
uh,

254
00:12:57,220 --> 00:12:59,350
for um,
you know,

255
00:12:59,380 --> 00:13:02,710
saying heretical things.
But you know,

256
00:13:02,711 --> 00:13:07,570
we are kind of getting to the point in 
many areas of society where you can lose

257
00:13:07,571 --> 00:13:09,160
your job,
you know,

258
00:13:09,190 --> 00:13:10,023
for,
for saying the wrong thing or 

259
00:13:11,401 --> 00:13:15,430
ideologically which in the Soviet Union,
the 19 seventies,

260
00:13:15,550 --> 00:13:16,383
that actually losing your job was a much
more likely outcome though I'm going to 

261
00:13:20,501 --> 00:13:21,251
present.
Like,

262
00:13:21,251 --> 00:13:24,550
unless you were actually like 
politically active as a destination.

263
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:25,553
Right.
It's interesting because I find that I 

264
00:13:28,290 --> 00:13:32,640
used to give anonymous people on line 
more crap for being anonymous,

265
00:13:32,660 --> 00:13:34,080
right.
A lot of people would respond and so,

266
00:13:34,081 --> 00:13:36,400
you know,
I don't want to lose my job right now.

267
00:13:36,460 --> 00:13:39,630
I don't know that there's a lot of 
instances of that in the United States,

268
00:13:39,631 --> 00:13:41,460
but it's more about that chilling 
effect,

269
00:13:41,461 --> 00:13:45,240
which is sort of what you're talking 
about existed all the time.

270
00:13:45,550 --> 00:13:48,300
So your parents never went to jail,
but they don't really talk about this.

271
00:13:48,301 --> 00:13:50,310
It's funny for all that.
So,

272
00:13:50,340 --> 00:13:51,173
so 16 years old you moved here,
was it because you realized that there 

273
00:13:54,331 --> 00:13:55,920
was this great opportunity

274
00:13:57,680 --> 00:13:58,890
when,
uh,

275
00:13:58,980 --> 00:14:03,720
they started really saying a Soviet Jews
in the seventies.

276
00:14:03,990 --> 00:14:08,990
And my dad had actually talked for 
several years about I'm leaving.

277
00:14:09,550 --> 00:14:11,550
Uh,
my mom was a little,

278
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:14,370
um,
more uncertain about it.

279
00:14:14,371 --> 00:14:18,600
She had a job that she really loved.
She was teaching at one.

280
00:14:18,630 --> 00:14:21,900
She's a music teacher and she actually 
still teaches a,

281
00:14:21,901 --> 00:14:26,901
but she was teaching at one of the top 
music schools in Moscow.

282
00:14:26,941 --> 00:14:28,620
Uh,
and uh,

283
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:29,713
you know,
she had students that she was very 

284
00:14:30,931 --> 00:14:33,940
attached to when she just really felt 
it.

285
00:14:34,010 --> 00:14:34,843
It was funny because she felt that she 
would never find that kind of work in 

286
00:14:37,411 --> 00:14:40,500
the US and she actually ended up doing 
pretty well,

287
00:14:40,501 --> 00:14:41,460
I think.
Um,

288
00:14:41,790 --> 00:14:42,720
so yeah,
but,

289
00:14:42,721 --> 00:14:43,554
so she was a little hesitant and it was 
also just sort of the general 

290
00:14:46,621 --> 00:14:47,670
uncertainty,
you know,

291
00:14:47,671 --> 00:14:50,340
moving to a whole new country,
learning a new language.

292
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:54,440
And I went to a school that specializes 
in English by the way.

293
00:14:54,441 --> 00:14:55,274
So I started learning English when I was
about seven and it wasn't really at the 

294
00:15:00,351 --> 00:15:04,340
time with a view to going to America 
eventually it was just because,

295
00:15:04,341 --> 00:15:05,174
I mean,
it was a better school than most and it 

296
00:15:07,251 --> 00:15:08,084
was a,
I think because of English there was 

297
00:15:10,191 --> 00:15:11,024
also more exposure to materials that you
wouldn't normally see on a curriculum 

298
00:15:16,251 --> 00:15:19,010
and so on.
So,

299
00:15:19,011 --> 00:15:19,641
uh,
you know,

300
00:15:19,641 --> 00:15:23,510
for me it was really,
at least in terms of language,

301
00:15:23,511 --> 00:15:26,280
it wasn't quite as intimidating.
Uh,

302
00:15:26,340 --> 00:15:29,270
my parents really did have to kind of 
start all over again.

303
00:15:30,020 --> 00:15:31,850
So yeah,
if finally,

304
00:15:31,851 --> 00:15:32,750
uh,
I think,

305
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:34,380
um,
my,

306
00:15:34,430 --> 00:15:35,263
my parents both felt that things were 
getting worst were the end of the 

307
00:15:39,231 --> 00:15:41,090
seventies.
Um,

308
00:15:41,210 --> 00:15:44,090
and uh,
at the time,

309
00:15:44,100 --> 00:15:46,100
again,
no one knew what was going to happen.

310
00:15:46,100 --> 00:15:47,220
Yeah.
Um,

311
00:15:47,660 --> 00:15:48,493
a lot of people thought that there was 
going to be a kind of resurgence of 

312
00:15:51,990 --> 00:15:54,620
Stalinist type,
uh,

313
00:15:54,621 --> 00:15:56,270
you know,
really harsh,

314
00:15:56,760 --> 00:15:57,593
brutal dictatorship where you could go 
to present and very easily for saying 

315
00:16:02,541 --> 00:16:04,310
the wrong thing.
Um,

316
00:16:05,210 --> 00:16:07,210
and uh,
at that point you were,

317
00:16:07,380 --> 00:16:09,080
you were allowed to just pick up and 
leave.

318
00:16:09,081 --> 00:16:10,800
Your parents were allowed to just,
okay,

319
00:16:10,930 --> 00:16:12,530
we're leaving now.
Not just,

320
00:16:12,610 --> 00:16:13,161
well,
no,

321
00:16:13,161 --> 00:16:13,431
no,
no.

322
00:16:13,431 --> 00:16:15,380
It certainly wasn't that simple.
I mean,

323
00:16:15,381 --> 00:16:18,590
you had to apply for permission to 
leave.

324
00:16:18,591 --> 00:16:20,180
Um,
it was,

325
00:16:20,181 --> 00:16:21,720
uh,
it was not for any one of,

326
00:16:21,730 --> 00:16:22,563
was basically limited to so good Jews 
who were officially being allowed to 

327
00:16:26,811 --> 00:16:31,811
leave for like repatriation to Israel 
and worth family reunification.

328
00:16:33,530 --> 00:16:37,820
And they really like the Jews,
but they weren't letting the Jews leave.

329
00:16:37,850 --> 00:16:42,850
Is that pretty much the antisemitism?
That was another thing.

330
00:16:42,951 --> 00:16:46,280
The antisemitism was growing much more 
noticeable.

331
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:48,793
It was getting to be very difficult for 
a young Jewish people to get into 

332
00:16:52,131 --> 00:16:54,410
college.
Um,

333
00:16:55,070 --> 00:16:56,360
you know,
we,

334
00:16:56,361 --> 00:16:58,940
my parents personally,
new situations where,

335
00:16:58,970 --> 00:17:02,030
you know,
kids who were extremely good students,

336
00:17:02,330 --> 00:17:03,163
uh,
were basically blog bull during the 

337
00:17:05,031 --> 00:17:09,230
admission exams and,
and it was this completely closed system

338
00:17:09,231 --> 00:17:10,064
where they didn't have to tell you like 
where you had failed on the exams and 

339
00:17:14,130 --> 00:17:14,620
the,
the,

340
00:17:14,620 --> 00:17:15,830
the,
it was really,

341
00:17:15,831 --> 00:17:19,130
really easy to kind of kill you if,
if they wanted to,

342
00:17:19,290 --> 00:17:22,070
especially since part of the infants 
exam,

343
00:17:22,071 --> 00:17:22,904
by the way was Marxism,
Leninism and quiz here you had to write 

344
00:17:27,891 --> 00:17:29,350
all these tuxes,
you know,

345
00:17:29,510 --> 00:17:34,510
the plenary session of the Communist 
Party in 1956 and then they can quiz you

346
00:17:36,230 --> 00:17:37,880
on the stuff and,
you know,

347
00:17:37,910 --> 00:17:39,860
and uh,
and it was really,

348
00:17:39,890 --> 00:17:41,950
again,
if they wanted to failure,

349
00:17:42,100 --> 00:17:44,900
it was just really easy to do that.
So,

350
00:17:44,901 --> 00:17:46,940
um,
you know,

351
00:17:46,941 --> 00:17:51,150
and I think that was a,
that was another reason that prompted my

352
00:17:51,151 --> 00:17:52,890
parents to finally decide to leave.

353
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:55,050
But yeah,
we officially,

354
00:17:55,380 --> 00:17:56,213
um,
we were emigrating to reunite with my 

355
00:18:00,301 --> 00:18:02,130
father,
his aunt and Israel.

356
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:05,040
And um,
and then what,

357
00:18:05,100 --> 00:18:09,170
how it was the whole thing kind of 
existed under Jackson Vanik.

358
00:18:09,220 --> 00:18:11,790
It was kind of an arrangement where the 
United States where,

359
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:14,430
you know,
Russia was where the Soviet Union at the

360
00:18:14,431 --> 00:18:17,460
time was getting,
um,

361
00:18:17,490 --> 00:18:18,323
kind of benefits and trade with the US 
in exchange for allowing Soviet Jews to 

362
00:18:22,651 --> 00:18:24,220
leave.
Um,

363
00:18:24,900 --> 00:18:25,733
and I think there were a few other 
groups like pentecostal Christians who 

364
00:18:29,731 --> 00:18:34,710
were kind of a very persecuted sucked 
who were also part of that,

365
00:18:34,711 --> 00:18:38,610
but mainly it was Soviet Jews say.
Yeah,

366
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:41,460
once you,
once you actually left the Soviet Union,

367
00:18:41,461 --> 00:18:42,294
then you got to Vienna as a way station 
and then you've got a choice of did you 

368
00:18:45,781 --> 00:18:48,470
want to go to Israel or did you want to 
go to the states?

369
00:18:48,471 --> 00:18:51,210
So you told them or they were under the 
impression you were going to Israel,

370
00:18:51,211 --> 00:18:52,380
but then you went to the United States.

371
00:18:52,890 --> 00:18:55,740
I think they kind of knew.
Yeah,

372
00:18:55,741 --> 00:18:58,710
I think they knew what was going on 
because I think at the time,

373
00:18:58,711 --> 00:18:59,544
like by the time that we were leaving,
I think about 80 percent of the Soviet 

374
00:19:02,161 --> 00:19:02,994
Jews who were at a grading,
we're actually going to the United 

375
00:19:05,810 --> 00:19:07,290
States.
They didn't really care.

376
00:19:07,291 --> 00:19:09,510
So what was it like you,
you sort of had the benefit of,

377
00:19:09,690 --> 00:19:10,523
as you said,
speaking English at an early age and go 

378
00:19:11,861 --> 00:19:12,860
into A.
Yeah,

379
00:19:13,350 --> 00:19:15,510
what was it like though to move to New 
Jersey?

380
00:19:15,511 --> 00:19:19,840
16 and,
and he actually wasn't.

381
00:19:19,860 --> 00:19:22,860
My very first statement was Jackson 
Heights,

382
00:19:22,861 --> 00:19:25,680
Queens,
Queens.

383
00:19:25,681 --> 00:19:27,330
Yeah.
And uh,

384
00:19:27,331 --> 00:19:28,590
this is funny.
My,

385
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:31,490
I actually um,
worked uh,

386
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:35,870
for about six months before my parents 
eventually found work in Jersey and that

387
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:38,500
was why we ended up moving.
Uh,

388
00:19:38,550 --> 00:19:39,383
but um,
for a while I was the main breadwinner 

389
00:19:41,911 --> 00:19:45,240
because I was the person with English 
and uh,

390
00:19:45,241 --> 00:19:50,241
I had a job as a secretary with the boy 
scouts of America,

391
00:19:50,700 --> 00:19:51,750
New York chapter.

392
00:19:52,230 --> 00:19:53,060
Uh,
yeah,

393
00:19:53,060 --> 00:19:53,893
because I also,
I knew how to type and I knew how to 

394
00:19:56,341 --> 00:19:59,340
tighten Russian,
but I rented a,

395
00:19:59,341 --> 00:20:03,870
a typewriter,
an English keyboard typewriter,

396
00:20:03,871 --> 00:20:08,871
and it took me about a week to relearn 
how to type in English and I'm like,

397
00:20:10,770 --> 00:20:11,820
what was that like?
I mean,

398
00:20:11,830 --> 00:20:15,510
you go from Russia and now you're the 
breadwinner for your parents in this new

399
00:20:15,511 --> 00:20:17,550
country learning a new job and all that.
I mean,

400
00:20:18,210 --> 00:20:20,210
how did that feel?
Oh,

401
00:20:20,250 --> 00:20:22,320
actually felt really exciting.
I,

402
00:20:22,380 --> 00:20:23,240
yeah,
no,

403
00:20:23,810 --> 00:20:24,643
no.
That whole period of my life was 

404
00:20:25,501 --> 00:20:28,070
actually quite exciting because,
um,

405
00:20:28,300 --> 00:20:29,133
you know,
just the mirror experience of going 

406
00:20:31,231 --> 00:20:32,730
abroad,
you know,

407
00:20:32,731 --> 00:20:37,440
and my father actually had traveled a 
bit because he was a musician.

408
00:20:37,890 --> 00:20:41,670
Uh,
he had traveled with the Moscow Symphony

409
00:20:41,700 --> 00:20:43,620
Orchestra.
He was actually mainly,

410
00:20:43,621 --> 00:20:45,210
he was a sound producer,
uh,

411
00:20:45,330 --> 00:20:46,020
for,
uh,

412
00:20:46,020 --> 00:20:49,150
for the radio,
but he was also a violinist and uh,

413
00:20:49,660 --> 00:20:51,880
uh,
he did occasionally get the travel.

414
00:20:51,940 --> 00:20:52,800
He was,
uh,

415
00:20:53,080 --> 00:20:55,000
yeah,
he had some interesting experiences to.

416
00:20:55,001 --> 00:20:55,834
He was actually in England in 1968 when 
the Soviet Union invaded Czechoslovakia 

417
00:21:03,430 --> 00:21:07,720
and he would have defected for sure if 
he doesn't have a family back home.

418
00:21:08,020 --> 00:21:12,220
And my mom actually wasn't even sure 
that he was coming back because when she

419
00:21:12,221 --> 00:21:14,260
heard about the invasion,
she was like,

420
00:21:14,290 --> 00:21:15,123
oh,
I got you.

421
00:21:15,180 --> 00:21:16,120
He's going to the doctor.

422
00:21:17,610 --> 00:21:19,040
Uh,
yeah,

423
00:21:19,530 --> 00:21:19,830
no,
no,

424
00:21:19,830 --> 00:21:20,580
no,
he bought.

425
00:21:20,580 --> 00:21:21,600
But he,
uh,

426
00:21:21,601 --> 00:21:23,030
I,
I think he was very,

427
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:25,420
very talented and uh,
I mean,

428
00:21:25,710 --> 00:21:26,543
I don't think he was tempted to actually
do it because he knew that he had a 

429
00:21:31,561 --> 00:21:34,920
family back home.
But he did say,

430
00:21:34,940 --> 00:21:36,900
you know,
that if it wasn't for that,

431
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:37,753
you know,
he probably would have made that 

432
00:21:39,331 --> 00:21:42,860
decision because it was just a,
um,

433
00:21:42,930 --> 00:21:45,960
and you know,
they had the experience of uh,

434
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:47,670
uh,
you know,

435
00:21:47,700 --> 00:21:51,610
being sort of booed by the woodlands of 
London.

436
00:21:51,750 --> 00:21:54,460
It was just,
it was really,

437
00:21:55,280 --> 00:22:00,280
really trying for.
Yeah,

438
00:22:00,490 --> 00:22:04,900
they didn't know we could go on and 
being an immigrant.

439
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:07,540
But it was,
for me,

440
00:22:07,541 --> 00:22:07,740
it was

441
00:22:07,740 --> 00:22:08,573
really exciting because first of all,
it was this whole world of information 

442
00:22:11,791 --> 00:22:13,620
that had opened up to me.
Like,

443
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:14,753
you know,
reading

444
00:22:14,950 --> 00:22:18,410
well and reading his paper

445
00:22:19,450 --> 00:22:20,283
and,
and I remember I just the experience 

446
00:22:22,950 --> 00:22:25,630
and,
and I actually still remember this,

447
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:28,840
I remember when,
when we came here,

448
00:22:28,841 --> 00:22:29,980
you know,
I opened,

449
00:22:29,981 --> 00:22:30,814
um,
I think it was the New York Post and 

450
00:22:33,251 --> 00:22:34,084
this was,
this was shortly before Reagan was 

451
00:22:37,181 --> 00:22:38,920
elected.
So you know,

452
00:22:38,921 --> 00:22:41,350
I opened the New York Post and I see 
this

453
00:22:41,620 --> 00:22:45,030
really mean cartoon of Jimmy Carter and 
I was like,

454
00:22:45,430 --> 00:22:50,430
this is just the president and here was 
this cartoon.

455
00:22:50,690 --> 00:22:55,690
It basically did some as a complainant.
I mean I love that.

456
00:22:55,981 --> 00:23:00,380
I love obviously frame so much of what 
you write about and,

457
00:23:00,390 --> 00:23:05,190
and that was just an amazing and that 
just suddenly,

458
00:23:05,191 --> 00:23:06,024
I mean I still remember that because it 
was this moment that really 

459
00:23:09,481 --> 00:23:11,360
crystallized,
you know,

460
00:23:11,430 --> 00:23:15,450
the fact of being in a free country that
you can actually do this.

461
00:23:15,930 --> 00:23:20,930
And I want to talk about some of the 
issues of being in a free country,

462
00:23:21,661 --> 00:23:22,494
but let's do,
let's do one other thing on first 

463
00:23:25,201 --> 00:23:27,500
because I mentioned some stuff about 
Russia up top.

464
00:23:28,050 --> 00:23:31,590
What do you make of just generally 
what's happening with Russia now?

465
00:23:31,650 --> 00:23:34,600
Just,
let's spend a couple minutes on that.

466
00:23:34,620 --> 00:23:35,453
Putin is really trying to fill this void
that America seems to be leaving in the 

467
00:23:39,121 --> 00:23:39,771
world.
What,

468
00:23:39,771 --> 00:23:42,810
what is going on in Syria?
Have they officially taken Ukraine?

469
00:23:43,010 --> 00:23:45,690
GimMe Gimme state of

470
00:23:46,180 --> 00:23:50,490
Russia on the state of Russia.
I thought,

471
00:23:50,650 --> 00:23:51,390
uh,
you know,

472
00:23:51,390 --> 00:23:55,760
pushing.
Definitely ever since he came to power,

473
00:23:55,770 --> 00:23:59,570
it's been increasingly clear that I 
think he wants to,

474
00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:03,090
you know,
rebuild a Russia as a superpower.

475
00:24:03,320 --> 00:24:06,980
It can really return to what the Soviet 
Union was,

476
00:24:07,010 --> 00:24:07,843
although I'm not really sure he 
understands that he took Ukraine right 

477
00:24:12,561 --> 00:24:13,290
or.
Yeah,

478
00:24:13,290 --> 00:24:15,070
well he is.
He took Crimea.

479
00:24:15,610 --> 00:24:16,443
Yeah.
There is this view that puts in a sort 

480
00:24:19,671 --> 00:24:21,900
of super humanly claver right.
And,

481
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:23,830
you know,
he's this great strategist.

482
00:24:24,560 --> 00:24:27,290
I'm not really sure that's the case 
because,

483
00:24:27,380 --> 00:24:28,790
you know,
actually,

484
00:24:29,150 --> 00:24:29,983
uh,
arguably he could have gotten further 

485
00:24:32,700 --> 00:24:36,530
with Ukraine if he had just maintained 
a,

486
00:24:36,531 --> 00:24:37,364
you know,
tried to maintain a friendly 

487
00:24:38,781 --> 00:24:40,880
relationship with them then,
you know,

488
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:46,120
trade and so on without actually trying 
to force his person.

489
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:50,180
I don't want to say his puppet because.
Yeah,

490
00:24:50,181 --> 00:24:51,014
I don't,
I'm not even really sure that the 

491
00:24:52,941 --> 00:24:57,740
president who was a who was removed was 
completely a puppet of the prevalent,

492
00:24:58,040 --> 00:24:58,873
but he was definitely sort of Putin's 
man and I think he in a way kind of 

493
00:25:03,471 --> 00:25:04,670
overplayed his hand.

494
00:25:04,700 --> 00:25:06,170
Uh,
in Ukraine.

495
00:25:06,540 --> 00:25:07,373
Um,
I mean right now he's in a situation 

496
00:25:10,011 --> 00:25:10,844
where he's much better at kind of 
messing things up for other countries 

497
00:25:14,661 --> 00:25:17,660
than he is a,
you know,

498
00:25:17,661 --> 00:25:21,620
actually doing something good for Russia
because right now for instance,

499
00:25:21,621 --> 00:25:24,740
the situation with Ukraine is that,
yeah,

500
00:25:24,860 --> 00:25:25,693
I mean the,
the new government in Ukraine is not 

501
00:25:30,651 --> 00:25:35,651
really able to push through the reforms 
that are ones partly because it's bogged

502
00:25:36,891 --> 00:25:37,724
down in this endless kind of undeclared 
war that's going on in the eastern 

503
00:25:41,421 --> 00:25:43,190
regions.
And you know,

504
00:25:43,191 --> 00:25:45,650
they've got poor breathing down their 
neck basically.

505
00:25:45,950 --> 00:25:49,750
But at the same time Russia is also 
bogged down in this.

506
00:25:49,751 --> 00:25:54,751
I'm declared war and it can really tell.
A lot of the stuff can kind of come back

507
00:25:55,911 --> 00:25:56,744
and bite Russia because they're creating
this kind of quasi mercenary army of 

508
00:26:04,370 --> 00:26:08,840
armed people who will have the 
experience now of fighting.

509
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:13,840
And the guerrilla war and who knows what
will happen when these people are told,

510
00:26:14,151 --> 00:26:16,670
well we don't need you anymore because 
we're kind of done with this.

511
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:17,713
So I think that's good.
Prayed a lot of the stabilization in 

512
00:26:20,631 --> 00:26:22,880
Russia itself.
Um,

513
00:26:23,390 --> 00:26:27,050
and he and I could go on and on and 
under does because he's also his god,

514
00:26:27,080 --> 00:26:27,913
he's kind of got a tiger by the tail and
Chechnya because basically he made a 

515
00:26:31,401 --> 00:26:36,401
deal with a guy runs on Kadira of,
of well you basically like,

516
00:26:36,891 --> 00:26:41,891
you make sure church now stays a Russian
province and you know,

517
00:26:41,901 --> 00:26:46,901
you make sure that on God's 100 percent 
of the votes and judge now elections,

518
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:51,030
which I think he does and you know,
you make sure that,

519
00:26:51,031 --> 00:26:51,864
you know,
we get a cut of the oil profits and 

520
00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:55,740
exchange,
you can really do anything you want.

521
00:26:56,170 --> 00:26:59,400
So,
and this is actually kind of interesting

522
00:26:59,401 --> 00:27:00,234
because I know that there are people on 
the rights in the west who see Putin as 

523
00:27:04,621 --> 00:27:08,490
this kind of bull work of the fence 
against Sharia law,

524
00:27:09,080 --> 00:27:13,170
uh,
under Putin's leadership there as a part

525
00:27:13,171 --> 00:27:14,910
of the Russian Federation.

526
00:27:14,910 --> 00:27:18,150
That is basically a Sharia state,
which has changed now.

527
00:27:18,151 --> 00:27:20,240
Yeah.
And not many people know that this,

528
00:27:20,250 --> 00:27:24,160
I didn't know that it actually is.
It's,

529
00:27:24,170 --> 00:27:26,730
you know,
women are forced to wear veils,

530
00:27:26,731 --> 00:27:27,564
you know,
this was a guy who was actually spoken 

531
00:27:29,311 --> 00:27:32,310
out in favor of a,
um,

532
00:27:32,710 --> 00:27:37,530
a polygamy which is technically illegal 
under a Russian law and,

533
00:27:37,560 --> 00:27:39,230
you know,
and there are people who have said like,

534
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:40,073
wait a minute,
you know,

535
00:27:40,120 --> 00:27:44,630
this guy is the president of a,
a,

536
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:45,473
you know,
a republic that is part of the Russian 

537
00:27:47,820 --> 00:27:49,500
Federation.
What is he doing?

538
00:27:49,501 --> 00:27:53,250
Really advocating things that are 
contrary to the Russian constitution.

539
00:27:53,251 --> 00:27:55,470
And of course,
who really cares because,

540
00:27:55,800 --> 00:27:56,633
you know,
the law currently is votes to keep the 

541
00:28:01,050 --> 00:28:04,440
boats.
And also this guy is a Cadeira is,

542
00:28:04,441 --> 00:28:07,190
is a very,
very strong and supporter.

543
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:08,520
Like he,
uh,

544
00:28:08,521 --> 00:28:12,750
if necessary he will bring out his 
troops that are loyal to him,

545
00:28:12,751 --> 00:28:13,920
you know,
to fight.

546
00:28:14,130 --> 00:28:14,970
Uh,
I mean,

547
00:28:14,971 --> 00:28:15,540
I,
I,

548
00:28:15,540 --> 00:28:20,540
it's pretty well known that he's sent 
people to eastern Ukraine to,

549
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:23,590
uh,
to fight in the guerrilla war there.

550
00:28:23,610 --> 00:28:24,151
So.
Yeah.

551
00:28:24,151 --> 00:28:24,984
But at the same time,
it has kind of a tiger by the tail 

552
00:28:26,641 --> 00:28:31,641
situation because if suddenly it becomes
out of the stages for turn tournament,

553
00:28:32,190 --> 00:28:34,290
you know,
who knows what's going to happen.

554
00:28:34,291 --> 00:28:36,240
And he's a,
he's a pretty dangerous guy,

555
00:28:36,241 --> 00:28:37,110
you know,
he's a,

556
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:40,320
he's kind of the classic warlord who 
was,

557
00:28:40,321 --> 00:28:42,420
you know,
God as people who are extremely loyal,

558
00:28:42,421 --> 00:28:43,254
they have a potential,
is quite as smart as his often given 

559
00:28:49,351 --> 00:28:50,184
credit for it.
I think a lot of the time when he's 

560
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:53,273
succeeded,
it's mainly because of the failures of 

561
00:28:55,951 --> 00:28:58,130
the West because,
you know,

562
00:28:58,140 --> 00:28:59,630
he has his side.
He is,

563
00:28:59,740 --> 00:29:04,170
he's good at stepping into the vacuum 
that arises when,

564
00:29:04,500 --> 00:29:05,333
for instance,
in American leadership kind of pulls 

565
00:29:07,441 --> 00:29:09,450
back.
So that's the perfect segue of course,

566
00:29:09,451 --> 00:29:10,284
to everything that's going on in Syria.
What is he trying to accomplish in 

567
00:29:14,461 --> 00:29:16,260
Syria?
Is He really trying to.

568
00:29:18,690 --> 00:29:22,710
And I think part of that is really just 
to signal that,

569
00:29:22,711 --> 00:29:25,170
you know,
he stands behind US allies.

570
00:29:25,630 --> 00:29:26,670
Uh,
and yeah,

571
00:29:26,671 --> 00:29:29,100
he's a sensibly making noises about,
you know,

572
00:29:29,101 --> 00:29:31,560
creating the preconditions for a,
you know,

573
00:29:31,561 --> 00:29:34,260
a sod to talk to,
talk to the opposition.

574
00:29:34,560 --> 00:29:35,393
But,
you know,

575
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:38,940
given the way that put him treats the 
opposition and Russia,

576
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:40,231
I mean,
okay,

577
00:29:40,231 --> 00:29:43,550
he doesn't carpet bomb,
but uh,

578
00:29:44,020 --> 00:29:46,570
uh,
but that's really,

579
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:49,010
other than that,
the rest of it,

580
00:29:49,690 --> 00:29:52,900
he's really not a talking to the 
opposition guy.

581
00:29:53,230 --> 00:29:55,110
He's more of a,
you know,

582
00:29:55,150 --> 00:29:57,640
kill the opposition quietly or,
you know,

583
00:29:57,641 --> 00:29:59,850
put them in jail or,
you know,

584
00:29:59,860 --> 00:30:04,270
basically leave them with no 
institutional support whatsoever guy.

585
00:30:04,271 --> 00:30:04,751
And,
you know,

586
00:30:04,751 --> 00:30:06,370
we,
we,

587
00:30:06,371 --> 00:30:08,950
I,
I think it's really fairly clear that,

588
00:30:09,010 --> 00:30:09,450
you know,
the,

589
00:30:09,450 --> 00:30:14,020
the murder of Boris Nemtsov who was a 
forum at one point,

590
00:30:14,021 --> 00:30:18,310
a really popular governor who later 
became part of the opposition.

591
00:30:18,311 --> 00:30:20,040
And uh,
um,

592
00:30:20,290 --> 00:30:21,730
you know,
who I think,

593
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,890
who had the charisma really to,
uh,

594
00:30:24,940 --> 00:30:25,773
to appeal to people.
I don't know that he actually was 

595
00:30:28,540 --> 00:30:30,850
directly a threat to put in.
But,

596
00:30:30,900 --> 00:30:32,460
you know,
buddy might sell it.

597
00:30:32,461 --> 00:30:36,850
It's fairly clear that there was some 
kind of official hand in his murder.

598
00:30:37,310 --> 00:30:38,050
So,
I mean,

599
00:30:38,050 --> 00:30:40,300
I think that kind of tells you a lot 
about,

600
00:30:40,350 --> 00:30:41,860
um,
you know,

601
00:30:41,950 --> 00:30:44,880
how puts in feels about dealing with the
possession.

602
00:30:44,930 --> 00:30:49,210
So basically the idea here,
I think he wants to keep us on empower.

603
00:30:49,560 --> 00:30:50,393
I think my guy,
it's probably good for the economy at 

604
00:30:51,781 --> 00:30:52,610
some level.

605
00:30:52,610 --> 00:30:55,440
Yeah,
exactly.

606
00:30:55,441 --> 00:31:00,441
And I think it's good for kind of 
maintaining strong man image both inside

607
00:31:02,911 --> 00:31:03,744
and outside Russia put there.
I clearly kind of has an affinity with 

608
00:31:08,920 --> 00:31:09,753
dictators a,
he gets pretty upset at regime change 

609
00:31:15,691 --> 00:31:17,140
anywhere,
you know,

610
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:18,233
he was from,
I've heard stories and I got and you 

611
00:31:22,021 --> 00:31:24,990
know,
these are sort of rumors from people who

612
00:31:24,991 --> 00:31:26,850
are,
who have been on the inside,

613
00:31:27,270 --> 00:31:28,103
but I've heard that he was extremely 
upset by what happened to Qaddafi and 

614
00:31:32,701 --> 00:31:36,990
that he really took that personally.
He took it personally.

615
00:31:36,991 --> 00:31:40,540
Yeah.
Well that's what they may someday way.

616
00:31:40,950 --> 00:31:41,783
And I think he,
part of his issues with the United 

617
00:31:44,970 --> 00:31:48,750
States and I think it goes back to a 
rock and a few other things.

618
00:31:49,020 --> 00:31:52,380
But he really does see the United States
as,

619
00:31:52,381 --> 00:31:53,214
you know,
promoting regime change around the 

620
00:31:54,661 --> 00:31:57,180
world.
And um,

621
00:31:57,240 --> 00:32:00,480
and I think that's part of this beef 
with the US.

622
00:32:00,510 --> 00:32:00,961
Yeah.
So,

623
00:32:00,961 --> 00:32:01,794
so is that the irony of where we're at 
at the moment that it seems to me that 

624
00:32:05,101 --> 00:32:05,934
the Democrats and Hillary are more anti 
Russia than the Republicans at the 

625
00:32:09,931 --> 00:32:10,764
moment.
Now maybe trump has business ties for 

626
00:32:16,910 --> 00:32:20,840
going in and toppling Gaddafi and 
apparently now it came out that a lot of

627
00:32:20,841 --> 00:32:24,620
the leaders of the army were saying 
don't do it.

628
00:32:24,900 --> 00:32:25,733
So.
So there is some legitimacy to Putin's 

629
00:32:27,201 --> 00:32:28,130
fears,
I suppose,

630
00:32:28,460 --> 00:32:29,330
if you were putting.
You can.

631
00:32:29,340 --> 00:32:30,173
Okay.

632
00:32:30,450 --> 00:32:31,101
Yeah.
Well,

633
00:32:31,101 --> 00:32:32,240
I mean I think that,
uh,

634
00:32:32,250 --> 00:32:34,700
what,
when we'll look at it and I don't really

635
00:32:34,701 --> 00:32:38,840
want to get until the whole Middle East.
We're going,

636
00:32:39,170 --> 00:32:41,600
we're going to spend the next hour 
talking about the Middle East.

637
00:32:41,610 --> 00:32:42,443
Yeah,
I understand the kind of anti 

638
00:32:47,751 --> 00:32:48,584
introduction of good men.
I think we've definitely overextended 

639
00:32:52,701 --> 00:32:53,534
ourselves and you know,
doing things around the world that get 

640
00:32:56,931 --> 00:33:01,220
us into really messy situations.
At the same time,

641
00:33:01,310 --> 00:33:05,180
I'm a little skeptical of this whole 
kind of line of argument that,

642
00:33:05,210 --> 00:33:06,890
oh,
well we've made such a mess.

643
00:33:08,030 --> 00:33:12,140
There was this assumption that if only 
it weren't for our intervention,

644
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:14,780
like everything would be,
you know,

645
00:33:14,790 --> 00:33:19,790
peaceful and quiet.
I think that that's necessarily the case

646
00:33:19,881 --> 00:33:20,714
and I think that in a way,
it's funny because it kind of parallels 

647
00:33:24,141 --> 00:33:26,990
a lot of the left wing arguments about 
foreign policy.

648
00:33:26,991 --> 00:33:29,960
Like the other day I saw somebody on 
twitter and I don't,

649
00:33:29,961 --> 00:33:30,794
I'm not even sure why this came up,
but for some reason they were talking 

650
00:33:33,651 --> 00:33:34,311
about how,
oh,

651
00:33:34,311 --> 00:33:35,144
well it was really Nixon who was 
responsible for the genocide in 

652
00:33:38,031 --> 00:33:38,864
Cambodia.

653
00:33:39,070 --> 00:33:44,070
I don't know what he was actually 
responsible for that.

654
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:47,073
So it's this mindset that somehow the 
west is behind everything bad that 

655
00:33:52,881 --> 00:33:55,960
happens in non western countries.
And I think it's again,

656
00:33:55,970 --> 00:33:59,960
kind of ironic that we're seeing the 
same kind of mindset on the,

657
00:34:00,050 --> 00:34:02,000
on the anti interventionist,
right.

658
00:34:02,001 --> 00:34:03,170
Today.
And again,

659
00:34:03,171 --> 00:34:04,770
this is not to say that,
you know,

660
00:34:04,790 --> 00:34:09,710
mistakes have been made so to speak,
but it really doesn't mean that,

661
00:34:09,740 --> 00:34:11,120
you know,
if we,

662
00:34:11,121 --> 00:34:16,121
if we hadn't blundered in Libya and Iraq
and so on,

663
00:34:16,400 --> 00:34:19,850
that,
that region today would be just,

664
00:34:19,851 --> 00:34:20,684
you know,
what model of peace and quiet I don't 

665
00:34:22,041 --> 00:34:25,130
think that we have no idea by the way 
what would have happened.

666
00:34:25,530 --> 00:34:26,363
But we do know that actually Iraq was 
better and they were having basically 

667
00:34:29,721 --> 00:34:34,130
free elections and then we left,
had signed the thing to leave.

668
00:34:34,131 --> 00:34:39,030
But Obama is a collective responsibility
for this.

669
00:34:39,050 --> 00:34:40,040
I think,
um,

670
00:34:40,400 --> 00:34:41,590
you know,
uh,

671
00:34:41,630 --> 00:34:44,870
leaving aside the merits of the invasion
itself,

672
00:34:44,871 --> 00:34:45,704
I think it's pretty clear that the 
administration and Iraq post invasion 

673
00:34:49,070 --> 00:34:51,250
was very badly mismanaged.
Dan,

674
00:34:51,260 --> 00:34:52,093
I think that was part of why I think 
they weren't able to get a deal that 

675
00:34:56,601 --> 00:34:58,700
would have allowed us to keep some 
troops there.

676
00:34:59,210 --> 00:35:01,440
Um,
but again,

677
00:35:01,490 --> 00:35:06,350
we don't want them to all think what 
you're saying is that not everything all

678
00:35:06,351 --> 00:35:08,760
the time,
no,

679
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:09,633
it's not.
And that it's really whether you're 

680
00:35:11,841 --> 00:35:15,140
blaming George W dot Bush or whether 
you're a blaming Hillary.

681
00:35:15,141 --> 00:35:16,970
And Obama,
you know,

682
00:35:17,090 --> 00:35:20,630
it's really much,
much more complicated than that.

683
00:35:20,631 --> 00:35:21,464
There are forces,
and it's kind of ironic because in a 

684
00:35:23,871 --> 00:35:27,230
way,
in a ways demeaning really to the people

685
00:35:27,231 --> 00:35:29,390
in those countries to say that,
oh,

686
00:35:29,391 --> 00:35:30,224
well,
everything they do is really only 

687
00:35:31,701 --> 00:35:32,534
because of instigation and so forth.
They have their own extremely 

688
00:35:39,541 --> 00:35:42,240
complicated history.
Um,

689
00:35:42,270 --> 00:35:45,330
and you know,
they do things for their own reasons.

690
00:35:45,331 --> 00:35:48,720
I mean,
obviously we're contribute for better or

691
00:35:48,721 --> 00:35:50,510
for worse,
but it's,

692
00:35:50,511 --> 00:35:52,980
it's really an oversimplification to say
that,

693
00:35:53,010 --> 00:35:53,843
oh well.
And a lot of conservatives are saying 

694
00:35:55,261 --> 00:35:55,921
that now.
Oh,

695
00:35:55,921 --> 00:35:56,754
well,
Hillary started this mess in the Middle 

696
00:35:58,380 --> 00:35:59,213
East

697
00:36:04,110 --> 00:36:04,841
also.
Of course,

698
00:36:04,841 --> 00:36:07,030
it always depends on where you want to 
start history,

699
00:36:07,360 --> 00:36:09,220
because there was something called the 
Ottoman Empire,

700
00:36:09,221 --> 00:36:10,054
that realm,
and then there was the British empire 

701
00:36:11,741 --> 00:36:13,010
and then the United States and all that.
Okay.

702
00:36:13,070 --> 00:36:13,810
So,
yeah,

703
00:36:13,810 --> 00:36:14,291
so.
All right,

704
00:36:14,291 --> 00:36:14,950
let's,
uh,

705
00:36:14,950 --> 00:36:15,783
let's move from some geo political stuff
and let's talk about the issues of the 

706
00:36:17,651 --> 00:36:17,980
day.
Let's,

707
00:36:17,980 --> 00:36:21,130
let's come back to America for a moment 
because that's where you do most of your

708
00:36:21,131 --> 00:36:22,180
writing about now.
And

709
00:36:23,450 --> 00:36:27,360
no know I do actually write quite a bit 
about Russia because I do have,

710
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:28,633
you know,
the,

711
00:36:28,650 --> 00:36:31,760
the experience that I think,
you know,

712
00:36:31,770 --> 00:36:34,950
it was really helpful in assessing 
what's happening there.

713
00:36:35,100 --> 00:36:35,970
Yeah.
So.

714
00:36:35,971 --> 00:36:37,260
All right,
let's start with,

715
00:36:37,261 --> 00:36:39,960
we're going to talk about the regressive
left and the alt right.

716
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:41,610
Which one would you prefer to start 
with?

717
00:36:42,380 --> 00:36:43,970
What feels like a better transition 
there?

718
00:36:44,550 --> 00:36:47,860
Uh,
you mean like what I like to start?

719
00:36:47,880 --> 00:36:49,930
Well,
there were regressive laughter.

720
00:36:49,931 --> 00:36:51,240
All right first.
Oh,

721
00:36:51,241 --> 00:36:52,660
let's do the alt right.
Okay.

722
00:36:53,860 --> 00:36:54,693
So let's do

723
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:56,113
Italy in Russia is a good kind of segue 
to the alt right because I think that a 

724
00:36:59,781 --> 00:37:03,490
lot of people on the outright have the 
uh,

725
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:05,580
you know,
put some cold.

726
00:37:06,110 --> 00:37:06,481
Yeah.
Okay.

727
00:37:06,481 --> 00:37:07,314
So how would you just give me your.
And of course a lot of them are just 

728
00:37:11,230 --> 00:37:12,480
crumbling walls.
Really.

729
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:14,170
There's a lot of trolls on the.
Alright,

730
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:15,040
we know that.
But what is,

731
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:17,520
what is your definition of the alt 
right?

732
00:37:17,521 --> 00:37:18,354
What is the outright to you?
Because I think nobody's defining it 

733
00:37:20,221 --> 00:37:21,600
properly.
So everyone,

734
00:37:21,601 --> 00:37:24,200
everyone uses it for their own right.
But they're on purpose

735
00:37:24,250 --> 00:37:25,083
right?
Well,

736
00:37:25,950 --> 00:37:28,750
it's difficult to define actually 
because,

737
00:37:28,930 --> 00:37:30,820
uh,
there probably isn't a single.

738
00:37:30,821 --> 00:37:32,360
All right.
Um,

739
00:37:32,390 --> 00:37:37,300
I mean it started maybe five or six 
years ago,

740
00:37:37,630 --> 00:37:38,463
uh,
was a bunch of people on really obscure 

741
00:37:40,931 --> 00:37:45,931
websites and there are these different 
kind of factions of the outright,

742
00:37:46,100 --> 00:37:49,030
some of which are the,
like there's the end.

743
00:37:49,031 --> 00:37:51,990
I haven't really written about the whole
neoreaction array,

744
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:52,833
so called dub phenomenon,
which is really about a kind of going 

745
00:37:58,001 --> 00:38:02,740
back to pre democracy political 
institutions,

746
00:38:02,741 --> 00:38:03,574
you know,
a lot of them are three pro monitor 

747
00:38:05,411 --> 00:38:07,570
care,
which is kind of a nonstarter.

748
00:38:07,600 --> 00:38:08,433
The United States.

749
00:38:08,860 --> 00:38:11,710
It's not,
let's not tear up the whole system.

750
00:38:11,711 --> 00:38:12,544
That was.
Yeah.

751
00:38:12,710 --> 00:38:15,800
But I think today what people,
uh,

752
00:38:15,890 --> 00:38:16,723
with people we usually have referred to 
when they talk about the alt right is 

753
00:38:21,441 --> 00:38:24,590
it's more kind of white nationalist 
segments.

754
00:38:24,591 --> 00:38:27,500
And I think that has primarily come to 
be,

755
00:38:28,020 --> 00:38:32,540
uh,
associated especially with the,

756
00:38:32,541 --> 00:38:34,700
um,
the trump campaign,

757
00:38:34,701 --> 00:38:36,130
which,
uh,

758
00:38:36,131 --> 00:38:39,220
you know,
the alt right has been kind of a,

759
00:38:39,221 --> 00:38:40,820
a,
an affiliate.

760
00:38:40,821 --> 00:38:41,550
Okay.

761
00:38:41,550 --> 00:38:42,440
Way.
So,

762
00:38:42,780 --> 00:38:43,840
correct me if I'm wrong,
but my.

763
00:38:43,900 --> 00:38:47,320
My take on it has been that when people 
refer to the alt right,

764
00:38:47,321 --> 00:38:48,154
yeah,
they're referring to this white 

765
00:38:49,121 --> 00:38:52,120
nationalist group of people and these 
neonazis in that thing.

766
00:38:52,420 --> 00:38:53,253
My feeling about it from what I've seen,
just being online and talking to people 

767
00:38:56,471 --> 00:38:57,304
and seeing what people send me things is
that a huge percentage of the alt right 

768
00:39:00,130 --> 00:39:05,130
is just really disaffected.
People who love memes and they love shit

769
00:39:05,831 --> 00:39:09,700
posting and sending a Nazi imagery to 
people and all this stuff.

770
00:39:09,701 --> 00:39:10,534
Not because they're Nazis,
but they're so frustrated with the 

771
00:39:13,151 --> 00:39:15,160
system that they're just trying to get a
reaction.

772
00:39:15,430 --> 00:39:18,390
Now I'm not apologizing for them and I 
don't like getting those things.

773
00:39:18,520 --> 00:39:19,353
I wouldn't stop them.
Sure we get as long as they're not 

774
00:39:20,591 --> 00:39:23,110
trying to physically harm anybody,
but I.

775
00:39:23,170 --> 00:39:24,003
to me,
the the white nationalist subset of it 

776
00:39:25,331 --> 00:39:26,164
obviously exists,
but it actually strikes me as a small 

777
00:39:28,421 --> 00:39:29,254
portion of a movement that really is 
just pissed it conservatives that are 

778
00:39:33,310 --> 00:39:35,740
pissed at the people on the right who 
didn't do the things they said they were

779
00:39:35,741 --> 00:39:37,420
going to do.
They're pissed at the system,

780
00:39:37,421 --> 00:39:38,440
they're pissed at the media.
I mean,

781
00:39:38,441 --> 00:39:42,100
a lot of the things that I actually do 
care about yet,

782
00:39:42,130 --> 00:39:42,963
there is absolutely a truly Zena phobic 
component to it that doesn't like black 

783
00:39:47,141 --> 00:39:48,460
people,
that doesn't like Muslims,

784
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:49,661
gays,
Jews,

785
00:39:49,661 --> 00:39:50,494
et cetera.
Do you think that's fair to say that 

786
00:39:51,851 --> 00:39:52,684
there's some,

787
00:39:52,870 --> 00:39:53,703
it's really difficult to estimate the 
percentages because it's not like it's 

788
00:39:58,071 --> 00:39:58,904
not a movement where you can do a poll 
and find out what percentage of people 

789
00:40:04,581 --> 00:40:07,790
who are sort of affiliated with the alt 
right online,

790
00:40:08,200 --> 00:40:09,033
uh,
or actually just sort of disaffected 

791
00:40:10,701 --> 00:40:13,700
conservatives or libertarians who,
you know,

792
00:40:13,701 --> 00:40:18,701
like names and shit posting or former 
liberal liberal.

793
00:40:19,990 --> 00:40:21,650
Yeah.
As opposed to,

794
00:40:21,670 --> 00:40:24,530
you know,
actual white nationalists or uh,

795
00:40:24,531 --> 00:40:25,930
you know,
even neo Nazis,

796
00:40:26,310 --> 00:40:29,420
uh,
we don't have a know how many people are

797
00:40:29,421 --> 00:40:32,930
actually involved because a lot of them 
could be like,

798
00:40:32,931 --> 00:40:37,931
one person was the 30 handles.
It could be like a,

799
00:40:38,091 --> 00:40:40,460
what was that guy's name?
Joshua Goldberg.

800
00:40:40,461 --> 00:40:45,290
Remember this was the,
a Jewish guy who had all these different

801
00:40:45,291 --> 00:40:47,540
identities including,
uh,

802
00:40:47,541 --> 00:40:49,280
including a Nazi.
He posted.

803
00:40:50,590 --> 00:40:52,250
Oh yeah.
This is an amazing story.

804
00:40:52,251 --> 00:40:54,770
And I actually,
he eventually got a rust,

805
00:40:54,771 --> 00:40:57,560
the current season of south park,
I don't know if you're watching,

806
00:40:57,561 --> 00:40:59,000
but I know I know.

807
00:40:59,590 --> 00:41:00,423
No,
but he eventually got arrested I think 

808
00:41:01,821 --> 00:41:05,940
for a raw trying to stage some kind of a
terrorist attack.

809
00:41:05,960 --> 00:41:06,793
Like he was talking to some radical 
Muslims online also and I think he was 

810
00:41:10,161 --> 00:41:13,430
trying to persuade them that he was a 
radical Muslim too.

811
00:41:14,060 --> 00:41:14,893
And so he was trolling every one,
but he had some personas that really 

812
00:41:19,281 --> 00:41:20,130
were,
you know,

813
00:41:20,140 --> 00:41:22,760
that we're all right.
And so yeah,

814
00:41:22,790 --> 00:41:24,210
we could be,
you know,

815
00:41:24,230 --> 00:41:27,170
dealing with you don't know,
you know,

816
00:41:27,171 --> 00:41:29,240
you never really know who we are dealing
with,

817
00:41:29,270 --> 00:41:30,103
you know,
you can be dealing with a teenager who 

818
00:41:31,740 --> 00:41:34,330
know,
sitting in his parents bail basement,

819
00:41:34,940 --> 00:41:35,773
you know,
and pretending to be like 10 or 15 

820
00:41:38,691 --> 00:41:41,210
different people on twitter.
So then what do you make of the,

821
00:41:41,211 --> 00:41:45,680
of the strength of it then Hillary,
when Hillary calls out the alt right,

822
00:41:46,520 --> 00:41:49,700
are we talking about an actual political
movement here or

823
00:41:50,420 --> 00:41:53,300
is something of a political movement?
I mean,

824
00:41:53,301 --> 00:41:55,970
we know that there are these,
there are people,

825
00:41:55,980 --> 00:41:58,490
um,
websites like vade there,

826
00:41:58,820 --> 00:42:00,410
you know,
those are real people,

827
00:42:00,411 --> 00:42:01,600
those are not,
you know,

828
00:42:01,610 --> 00:42:05,390
teenagers a pretending to be somebody 
you know,

829
00:42:05,400 --> 00:42:07,340
well,
posting from their parents' basement.

830
00:42:07,900 --> 00:42:11,210
Uh,
now how much do they actually have?

831
00:42:12,080 --> 00:42:13,190
Again,
nobody knows.

832
00:42:13,191 --> 00:42:15,170
But I do think that there's a real 
movement there.

833
00:42:15,171 --> 00:42:16,004
I think that they are gaining a lot of 
visibility recently and it's really 

834
00:42:21,441 --> 00:42:25,070
difficult to even know how to deal with 
those because in a way of course,

835
00:42:25,071 --> 00:42:27,500
by criticizing them,
you know,

836
00:42:27,590 --> 00:42:30,440
people like me aren't giving them more 
visibility,

837
00:42:30,640 --> 00:42:34,220
but at the same time I do kind of feel 
that it is important to.

838
00:42:34,520 --> 00:42:38,300
And I really hate the word call out 
because it's been so thoroughly kind of,

839
00:42:38,750 --> 00:42:40,040
you know,
appropriate.

840
00:42:40,041 --> 00:42:40,730
Uh,
Duh,

841
00:42:40,730 --> 00:42:41,570
Duh,
you know,

842
00:42:41,590 --> 00:42:44,240
Ms Dot Hughes by the social justice 
people.

843
00:42:44,540 --> 00:42:48,080
But I do think that it's important to 
point to this and say,

844
00:42:48,081 --> 00:42:48,591
yeah,
you know,

845
00:42:48,591 --> 00:42:51,110
this was really going on in.
This was not a good thing.

846
00:42:51,560 --> 00:42:52,960
And I think that,
um,

847
00:42:53,150 --> 00:42:57,990
there are young people who do kind of 
ton to get drawn in by the stuff.

848
00:42:57,991 --> 00:43:00,530
For Real,
we have a lot of young people,

849
00:43:00,920 --> 00:43:03,080
uh,
who are extremely uneducated,

850
00:43:03,110 --> 00:43:03,943
you know,
and I think that is a problem with the 

851
00:43:05,511 --> 00:43:06,344
educational system.
We have a problem of kind of teaching 

852
00:43:09,801 --> 00:43:12,320
relativism and the Sun's Thought,
oh,

853
00:43:12,321 --> 00:43:12,981
well,
you know,

854
00:43:12,981 --> 00:43:17,780
there's really no such thing as 
objective truth and I think people have,

855
00:43:18,230 --> 00:43:20,000
people have been saying for a long time,
you know,

856
00:43:20,001 --> 00:43:24,050
those kinds of mindset eventually leads 
to embracing Holocaust denial that says,

857
00:43:24,320 --> 00:43:24,981
hey,
you know,

858
00:43:24,981 --> 00:43:29,981
who's to say what really happened of the
real truth is really historical truth is

859
00:43:30,711 --> 00:43:34,070
really only just a matter of who gets to
control the narrative,

860
00:43:34,420 --> 00:43:35,100
you know?
Right.

861
00:43:35,100 --> 00:43:37,120
That is a big problem because whoever 
yells,

862
00:43:37,200 --> 00:43:38,220
I mean,
just yesterday,

863
00:43:38,430 --> 00:43:40,890
did you see this guy at the trump 
rallies screaming about it?

864
00:43:41,530 --> 00:43:44,490
It's like,
I didn't retweet it because I don't want

865
00:43:44,491 --> 00:43:45,324
to amplify these crazy people.
And yet at the same point they've 

866
00:43:48,481 --> 00:43:50,930
suddenly found a voice,
trump.

867
00:43:51,190 --> 00:43:52,860
And I don't,
I don't think he's obviously,

868
00:43:52,861 --> 00:43:54,620
I don't think he's a Holocaust denier,
but there you.

869
00:43:54,910 --> 00:43:57,650
What is the connection to trump in this?
I guess it's,

870
00:43:58,200 --> 00:43:58,410
the

871
00:43:58,410 --> 00:44:03,410
connection to trump is not because of 
his rhetoric on immigration and not,

872
00:44:05,740 --> 00:44:10,740
not his specific positions so much as 
just that kind of level of vehemence and

873
00:44:14,820 --> 00:44:16,560
the common flake,
you know,

874
00:44:16,561 --> 00:44:17,460
and I'm in the,
yeah,

875
00:44:17,461 --> 00:44:21,410
it's true that he didn't say all Mexican
illegal immigrants are rapists,

876
00:44:21,450 --> 00:44:23,040
but like the whole,
Oh,

877
00:44:23,041 --> 00:44:24,210
you know,
these Mexican,

878
00:44:24,211 --> 00:44:26,760
you know,
Mexico is something as these rapists,

879
00:44:26,790 --> 00:44:27,623
uh,
you know,

880
00:44:28,030 --> 00:44:28,863
kind of stuff.
I think it did Sunday message to a lot 

881
00:44:32,941 --> 00:44:35,560
of people on the kind of genuine,
lazy,

882
00:44:35,570 --> 00:44:38,170
no fallback.
Um,

883
00:44:38,200 --> 00:44:39,030
uh,
you know,

884
00:44:39,030 --> 00:44:41,430
parts of the outright that,
hey,

885
00:44:41,431 --> 00:44:43,770
you know,
this is a guy who thinks that way we do.

886
00:44:44,220 --> 00:44:48,780
And um,
I think ann coulter is kind of a conduit

887
00:44:48,781 --> 00:44:50,790
there too because she's,
you know,

888
00:44:51,180 --> 00:44:56,180
she's actually engaged for years in some
extremely,

889
00:44:56,281 --> 00:44:58,690
um,
uh,

890
00:44:58,980 --> 00:44:59,813
kind of a nasty rhetoric targeting all 
sorts of different people and including 

891
00:45:05,491 --> 00:45:09,180
immigrants and invitation to come on the
show by the way.

892
00:45:09,240 --> 00:45:09,871
Oh,
okay.

893
00:45:09,871 --> 00:45:11,410
Okay.
And you know,

894
00:45:11,530 --> 00:45:14,370
she became a big cheerleader for trump.
And I mean,

895
00:45:14,371 --> 00:45:14,681
the,
the,

896
00:45:14,681 --> 00:45:15,514
the story that I've heard is that 
actually it's the success of her 

897
00:45:18,331 --> 00:45:20,430
anti-immigration book,
you know,

898
00:45:20,600 --> 00:45:22,930
audio Adios America,
uh,

899
00:45:22,950 --> 00:45:23,783
was what,
what kind of drove trump to decide 

900
00:45:26,821 --> 00:45:29,520
suddenly to make an aggression,
uh,

901
00:45:29,521 --> 00:45:32,430
the biggest show of his campaign because
he never really.

902
00:45:32,560 --> 00:45:35,940
This is kind of the interesting thing.
In 2012,

903
00:45:35,941 --> 00:45:40,390
he actually criticized Mitt Romney for 
being too anti integration,

904
00:45:41,190 --> 00:45:45,450
which is funny in a way when people talk
about trump,

905
00:45:45,451 --> 00:45:46,710
you know,
being this and that.

906
00:45:46,711 --> 00:45:49,750
Ideologically,
I think trump ideological,

907
00:45:49,751 --> 00:45:51,740
he trump is a trump.
See,

908
00:45:51,760 --> 00:45:53,310
you know,
he's a,

909
00:45:53,530 --> 00:45:56,760
is interested in his own advancement.
And that's it.

910
00:45:57,490 --> 00:46:01,110
That doesn't make him not dangerous 
because you know,

911
00:46:01,111 --> 00:46:04,980
and an ego maniac who is a,
you know,

912
00:46:05,040 --> 00:46:07,470
very close to being president of.
Well,

913
00:46:07,471 --> 00:46:08,304
I don't know how close right now,
if either one of them went to the trump 

914
00:46:13,490 --> 00:46:14,323
points.

915
00:46:14,460 --> 00:46:15,610
I agree.
I think he's,

916
00:46:15,670 --> 00:46:18,570
he's out for his own.
We don't know it.

917
00:46:18,571 --> 00:46:20,910
I don't think we fully understand what 
his motivations are,

918
00:46:20,911 --> 00:46:21,744
which may be all presidents have that.
But what I think Hillary is the more 

919
00:46:26,101 --> 00:46:29,220
conventional,
egomaniac political.

920
00:46:30,240 --> 00:46:32,880
My fear with the trump thing is that 
it's not,

921
00:46:32,910 --> 00:46:33,743
I don't think he's a white nationalist 
or something like that by any 

922
00:46:36,031 --> 00:46:36,864
estimation,
but I think he's allowed for it to 

923
00:46:39,001 --> 00:46:41,160
suddenly become.
It's sort of okay,

924
00:46:42,150 --> 00:46:43,470
you know,
and I like you.

925
00:46:43,471 --> 00:46:44,304
I'm a free speech absolutist.
So as long as these people aren't 

926
00:46:46,940 --> 00:46:47,773
calling to harm for letting them be out 
there and I'm not for banning any of 

927
00:46:50,731 --> 00:46:51,564
them,
just like I'm not for banning Milo from 

928
00:46:52,441 --> 00:46:53,274
twitter and all that,
but I fear at some level that we're 

929
00:46:56,371 --> 00:46:58,320
normalizing.
Well that's,

930
00:46:58,321 --> 00:46:59,154
yeah,
I think that is a problem and I think 

931
00:47:01,050 --> 00:47:05,110
that is really why I felt that it was 
important to,

932
00:47:05,200 --> 00:47:09,370
uh,
to address this and I have.

933
00:47:09,610 --> 00:47:11,250
And I really do have.
I mean,

934
00:47:11,251 --> 00:47:16,251
I think Milo was a very smart guy who 
has done some great things and you know,

935
00:47:17,910 --> 00:47:21,660
criticizing and mocking the social 
justice warriors.

936
00:47:22,080 --> 00:47:24,240
I mean,
I think it was a really,

937
00:47:24,241 --> 00:47:28,830
really big mistake for him to start 
essentially normalizing and legitimizing

938
00:47:28,840 --> 00:47:29,800
the,
uh,

939
00:47:29,801 --> 00:47:32,290
the,
these kind of creepy or uh,

940
00:47:32,580 --> 00:47:34,420
uh,
segments of the outright,

941
00:47:34,490 --> 00:47:35,290
right?
Yeah.

942
00:47:35,290 --> 00:47:37,270
Already.
Have you seen them turn on him lately?

943
00:47:37,271 --> 00:47:42,271
Because I've seen Nazis show up.
And how much of that is theater,

944
00:47:45,760 --> 00:47:46,720
you know,
I mean,

945
00:47:47,560 --> 00:47:49,360
I don't know how many of these people 
like,

946
00:47:49,361 --> 00:47:50,194
yeah,
I never actually get out of the 

947
00:47:50,951 --> 00:47:52,480
basement.
Uh,

948
00:47:54,150 --> 00:47:55,420
I would imagine so.
Yeah,

949
00:47:55,940 --> 00:47:57,260
time.
It's probably.

950
00:47:57,261 --> 00:47:58,094
Yeah.
Um,

951
00:47:58,390 --> 00:47:59,223
so yeah,
I think a lot of what goes on while the 

952
00:48:00,761 --> 00:48:02,260
outright as theater.
I mean,

953
00:48:02,290 --> 00:48:03,123
you know,
I've gotten threatening tweets and 

954
00:48:04,991 --> 00:48:08,770
messages from these people that I don't 
really take seriously.

955
00:48:08,770 --> 00:48:11,800
I mean,
it's a,

956
00:48:12,250 --> 00:48:13,083
I think a lot of that as really just 
kind of showing off and kind of being 

957
00:48:18,131 --> 00:48:19,960
assholes on twitter.
Uh,

958
00:48:20,700 --> 00:48:22,600
so the same time,
you know,

959
00:48:22,660 --> 00:48:24,790
when,
when you have a lot of this very violent

960
00:48:24,791 --> 00:48:25,624
rhetoric going on,
you never know when it's going to 

961
00:48:29,980 --> 00:48:31,730
actually,
uh,

962
00:48:31,731 --> 00:48:32,564
you know,
trickled down to the wrong person who 

963
00:48:34,631 --> 00:48:39,430
actually decides to do something about 
it and not just some tweets and so on.

964
00:48:39,670 --> 00:48:40,503
So I'm not going to say that this is 
sort of not dangerous because when you 

965
00:48:43,961 --> 00:48:44,794
have a lot of this rhetoric that 
demonizes people that calls for 

966
00:48:48,881 --> 00:48:50,310
violence,
uh,

967
00:48:50,311 --> 00:48:54,880
I mean there's a lot of rhetoric come 
calling for,

968
00:48:54,920 --> 00:48:58,150
you know,
retaliation against enemies of trump.

969
00:48:59,080 --> 00:49:03,650
And I've seen a lot of,
you know,

970
00:49:03,660 --> 00:49:04,690
I,
I think that the,

971
00:49:04,750 --> 00:49:07,330
the,
the rhetorical atmosphere,

972
00:49:07,331 --> 00:49:10,390
the rhetorical climate right now is 
really,

973
00:49:10,391 --> 00:49:11,224
is really bad.
And of course I'm not going to blame 

974
00:49:13,031 --> 00:49:14,620
that entirely on the.
All right,

975
00:49:14,621 --> 00:49:15,830
this may be a good moment.

976
00:49:15,880 --> 00:49:20,500
So that's a segue to the regressive.
That's exactly where I wanted to go with

977
00:49:20,501 --> 00:49:21,334
that because my,
the reason I've been somewhat 

978
00:49:22,451 --> 00:49:25,540
sympathetic to whatever the alt right 
is,

979
00:49:25,541 --> 00:49:26,374
is that I do see,
and I'm not defending the white 

980
00:49:28,691 --> 00:49:30,580
nationalists and for the purpose of 
this,

981
00:49:30,820 --> 00:49:34,930
but for all of the people that are just 
shit posting and upsetting everybody and

982
00:49:34,931 --> 00:49:35,764
are and are sending memes all over the 
place and trying to be heard and all 

983
00:49:38,411 --> 00:49:40,540
that.
They're angry at the establishment,

984
00:49:40,541 --> 00:49:41,374
which I fully understand and they're 
angry at political correctness and who 

985
00:49:44,111 --> 00:49:46,420
did that.
To them it was the regressive left,

986
00:49:46,421 --> 00:49:47,254
it was the people on the left that 
silenced everybody with these false 

987
00:49:49,991 --> 00:49:54,130
cries of racism and they're a natural 
reaction.

988
00:49:54,320 --> 00:49:56,220
And that's why I've been sort of what

989
00:49:56,570 --> 00:49:57,403
Hollywood kind of chaotic reaction,
real argument that I remember actually 

990
00:50:02,980 --> 00:50:03,813
arguing with my low back.
The 40 abroad does articles that were 

991
00:50:10,250 --> 00:50:11,083
kind of serious way when he was just 
kind of starting to kind of dabble and 

992
00:50:16,360 --> 00:50:18,440
you know,
apologize for the alt right.

993
00:50:18,680 --> 00:50:20,150
And he was basically saying,
oh,

994
00:50:20,151 --> 00:50:21,020
well,
you see what,

995
00:50:21,490 --> 00:50:22,323
what's really going on here as that they
want to challenge these taboos say 

996
00:50:26,600 --> 00:50:27,433
because a bit.
Because the racist label is constantly 

997
00:50:30,381 --> 00:50:32,210
being used.
The silence conservatives,

998
00:50:32,420 --> 00:50:33,253
uh,
they're actually trying to kind of make 

999
00:50:35,991 --> 00:50:36,824
that stigma,
meaning meaningless by actually saying 

1000
00:50:41,690 --> 00:50:46,380
that doesn't really work that way first 
of all bought.

1001
00:50:46,400 --> 00:50:48,830
But by doing this,
um,

1002
00:50:48,980 --> 00:50:49,813
because I do think that the vast 
majority of people who are not social 

1003
00:50:53,421 --> 00:50:54,254
justice warriors,
who are not the regressive left a 

1004
00:50:56,601 --> 00:51:01,601
nonetheless quite rightly low the and,
you know,

1005
00:51:01,780 --> 00:51:04,490
detest genuine racism and bigotry.

1006
00:51:04,810 --> 00:51:05,643
Uh,
what you're doing by saying all this 

1007
00:51:07,880 --> 00:51:11,410
crap is alienating people who could be,
it could be,

1008
00:51:11,510 --> 00:51:15,290
it could be your allies because you know
that they're gonna look at you and say,

1009
00:51:15,320 --> 00:51:15,951
Oh,
well,

1010
00:51:15,951 --> 00:51:18,380
you know,
these people really are racist crepes.

1011
00:51:19,390 --> 00:51:20,181
No,
thank you.

1012
00:51:20,181 --> 00:51:21,920
We don't really want anything to do with
them.

1013
00:51:22,290 --> 00:51:23,210
Say,
you know,

1014
00:51:23,211 --> 00:51:26,840
I mean,
that's really a little bit like a,

1015
00:51:26,841 --> 00:51:27,674
you know,
like if you're a black person who wants 

1016
00:51:30,141 --> 00:51:33,890
to challenge negative stereotypes of 
blocks,

1017
00:51:34,010 --> 00:51:36,210
you're not gonna do that by,
you know,

1018
00:51:36,230 --> 00:51:38,930
trying to embody the bed.
Like,

1019
00:51:39,250 --> 00:51:39,861
oh,
the,

1020
00:51:39,861 --> 00:51:42,960
I suppose the,
you have some people in the yellow,

1021
00:51:43,040 --> 00:51:46,430
the rap community who kind of do that 
and that stupid,

1022
00:51:46,431 --> 00:51:47,264
you know,
and it's,

1023
00:51:47,380 --> 00:51:49,280
it's stupid when,
uh,

1024
00:51:49,440 --> 00:51:53,220
when anti pc people do it,
it's a,

1025
00:51:53,530 --> 00:51:54,140
you know,
but,

1026
00:51:54,140 --> 00:51:56,500
but,
but I totally agree that the,

1027
00:51:56,530 --> 00:52:01,430
the left bears a lot of responsibility 
for the climate of uh,

1028
00:52:01,431 --> 00:52:01,921
you know,
the,

1029
00:52:01,921 --> 00:52:02,930
the,
the really,

1030
00:52:02,931 --> 00:52:05,240
really bad,
um,

1031
00:52:05,320 --> 00:52:06,153
and counterproductive rhetorical climate
that we have a uncouple some of that 

1032
00:52:11,091 --> 00:52:12,290
from left because that's,
you know,

1033
00:52:12,291 --> 00:52:13,124
that's why I've spent so much time 
talking about this show is that I want 

1034
00:52:16,191 --> 00:52:21,191
liberalism to turn to logic and reason 
and not always demonizing everybody.

1035
00:52:21,710 --> 00:52:22,543
How do I do that?
And he said almost too late because we 

1036
00:52:24,981 --> 00:52:29,981
now see whether side gaining power and 
that much more scared of the people that

1037
00:52:30,231 --> 00:52:32,370
are stuck.
Right.

1038
00:52:32,810 --> 00:52:34,460
Well,
I don't think it's too late.

1039
00:52:34,461 --> 00:52:37,220
I mean,
I don't think we're at the point yet.

1040
00:52:37,221 --> 00:52:38,054
You know,
we're not in the Soviet Union were not 

1041
00:52:39,741 --> 00:52:42,830
at the point where you can go to prison 
for,

1042
00:52:43,070 --> 00:52:44,330
you know,
wrong thing.

1043
00:52:44,630 --> 00:52:48,320
But you do see the findings of that.
But we do see the underpinnings of that.

1044
00:52:48,620 --> 00:52:51,280
I think it's really important for,
uh,

1045
00:52:51,370 --> 00:52:53,030
you know,
genuine liberals.

1046
00:52:53,800 --> 00:52:58,800
What I would love to see by the way is a
kind of liberal conservative alliance of

1047
00:53:00,260 --> 00:53:03,080
reasonable people.
And I think right now that is feasible.

1048
00:53:03,081 --> 00:53:06,860
I think we're seeing a lot of that.
We're seeing people like,

1049
00:53:06,880 --> 00:53:10,400
you know,
Jonathan chait on the liberal side of,

1050
00:53:10,401 --> 00:53:11,234
for instance,
speaking out against political 

1051
00:53:12,621 --> 00:53:15,960
correctness and getting attacked by the 
regressive love.

1052
00:53:16,830 --> 00:53:17,840
And as a,
you know,

1053
00:53:17,841 --> 00:53:20,120
the attacks are really always the same.
You know,

1054
00:53:20,121 --> 00:53:20,751
it's kind of,
oh,

1055
00:53:20,751 --> 00:53:21,584
like you're just another white male who 
doesn't like women and minorities 

1056
00:53:25,050 --> 00:53:25,883
criticizing you and you know,
and the only thing worse than a white 

1057
00:53:28,351 --> 00:53:29,184
male who doesn't think the way he spoke 
was because actually if you look at the 

1058
00:53:33,301 --> 00:53:34,134
article that Jonathan Shade got a talk,
he was talking about criticism directed 

1059
00:53:38,671 --> 00:53:39,504
at himself.
He was actually talking mainly about 

1060
00:53:41,251 --> 00:53:42,084
women in minorities who were getting a 
toxin really nasty ways for being 

1061
00:53:45,661 --> 00:53:47,930
politically incorrect.
Um,

1062
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:48,833
he was talking about people like this 
Muslim student at the University of 

1063
00:53:52,020 --> 00:53:54,900
Michigan who got really badly harassed 
for,

1064
00:53:54,901 --> 00:53:55,734
you know,
writing something that mark political 

1065
00:53:57,001 --> 00:53:57,960
correctness.
I mean,

1066
00:53:57,961 --> 00:53:58,794
I think he had like a bunch of really 
nasty leaflets dropped in front of the 

1067
00:54:01,890 --> 00:54:04,350
door of his apartment and stuff like 
that.

1068
00:54:04,351 --> 00:54:04,820
So,
I mean,

1069
00:54:04,820 --> 00:54:08,130
it wasn't even just people tweeting 
nasty things and so on.

1070
00:54:08,130 --> 00:54:08,963
It was a really,
in a way kind of quotes I physical 

1071
00:54:11,221 --> 00:54:12,170
harassment.
Uh,

1072
00:54:12,270 --> 00:54:15,470
so yeah,
I think that there is a um,

1073
00:54:15,500 --> 00:54:16,333
uh,
there was a movement of both 

1074
00:54:18,661 --> 00:54:23,661
conservatives and liberals who are very,
very ready to reject this and to kind of

1075
00:54:25,681 --> 00:54:28,650
try to restore rationality.
What I would love to see,

1076
00:54:28,651 --> 00:54:30,460
by the way,
and this is kind of my,

1077
00:54:30,800 --> 00:54:31,633
my own personal dream right now,
there isn't a single publication like I 

1078
00:54:35,641 --> 00:54:36,474
read a lot of publications online.
I don't think there was a single 

1079
00:54:39,121 --> 00:54:39,954
publication that could have consistently
stands up for a non sort of social 

1080
00:54:46,861 --> 00:54:48,040
justice.
And I put this,

1081
00:54:48,050 --> 00:54:50,670
the word social justice in quotation 
marks because,

1082
00:54:50,730 --> 00:54:51,760
because,
you know,

1083
00:54:51,780 --> 00:54:52,613
it really is a kind of what passes for 
social justice today is neil to tell 

1084
00:54:57,190 --> 00:55:01,290
attarian cult really is obsessed with 
controlling words and thoughts.

1085
00:55:01,350 --> 00:55:02,183
It's obsessed with identity politics and
it's obsessed with politicizing every 

1086
00:55:06,781 --> 00:55:08,040
single aspect of life.

1087
00:55:08,220 --> 00:55:10,080
It's like when you look at,
for instance,

1088
00:55:10,081 --> 00:55:13,650
the discussions of culture like movie,
whether it's movies,

1089
00:55:13,651 --> 00:55:15,470
video games,
uh,

1090
00:55:15,570 --> 00:55:16,403
books,
everything in the progressive media 

1091
00:55:19,600 --> 00:55:20,640
like,
you know,

1092
00:55:20,790 --> 00:55:21,623
vice,
a bridge to some extent of in the daily 

1093
00:55:24,571 --> 00:55:25,920
beast,
which I've written for in,

1094
00:55:25,921 --> 00:55:29,250
which I think does,
I mean the daily beast is one of the few

1095
00:55:29,490 --> 00:55:33,320
that doesn't kind of completely cooptive
by this and still publishes,

1096
00:55:33,680 --> 00:55:34,740
you know,
good stuff.

1097
00:55:35,100 --> 00:55:36,260
But,
um,

1098
00:55:36,350 --> 00:55:37,183
he or you know,
stuff that doesn't fit that kind of 

1099
00:55:39,720 --> 00:55:42,720
identity politics mode.
But a lot of that,

1100
00:55:42,721 --> 00:55:44,900
like all of the discussion of 
television,

1101
00:55:44,950 --> 00:55:48,030
everything,
it's completely in terms of,

1102
00:55:48,210 --> 00:55:49,050
you know,
oh,

1103
00:55:49,051 --> 00:55:51,750
well does this really rough luck,
you know,

1104
00:55:51,751 --> 00:55:55,590
the,
the true diversity of the population.

1105
00:55:55,591 --> 00:55:55,951
And,
you know,

1106
00:55:55,951 --> 00:56:00,951
do we have enough trans people and this.
And this is this cultural appropriation.

1107
00:56:02,521 --> 00:56:03,354
You know,
where does this writer really have the 

1108
00:56:05,341 --> 00:56:10,341
right to talk about this ethnic group 
the way that he or she does and it's all

1109
00:56:11,851 --> 00:56:15,930
in terms of this ideology and identity 
and it's ridiculous.

1110
00:56:16,010 --> 00:56:17,840
So that,
and I think what we,

1111
00:56:17,880 --> 00:56:18,713
what I would love to see.
So there's that and there's the 

1112
00:56:20,670 --> 00:56:21,503
conservative media on the other hand up,
but there isn't a single publication 

1113
00:56:26,800 --> 00:56:31,360
that could have consistently embraces a,
you know,

1114
00:56:31,361 --> 00:56:35,590
kind of true liberal point of view.
I mean there are still some publications

1115
00:56:35,840 --> 00:56:36,673
are likely Atlantic,
the daily based that have that point of 

1116
00:56:39,761 --> 00:56:44,500
view represented,
but it coexists with a lot of the really

1117
00:56:44,501 --> 00:56:47,800
hardcore kind of ideological,
uh,

1118
00:56:48,520 --> 00:56:51,230
Neela to talent tell Ryan as I would 
call it.

1119
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:52,833
And I think what that coexistence very 
often tends to lead to the liberal 

1120
00:56:58,151 --> 00:57:03,151
viewpoint being pushed out because the,
the social justice people,

1121
00:57:03,220 --> 00:57:05,350
they're really not interested in 
dialogue.

1122
00:57:05,710 --> 00:57:08,830
They think that the opposing viewpoint 
as evil.

1123
00:57:10,130 --> 00:57:14,290
Yeah.
So I mean it's a little bit like a,

1124
00:57:14,291 --> 00:57:17,060
you know,
you can't really have a dialogue between

1125
00:57:17,080 --> 00:57:22,080
voltaire on Torquemada was volunteering 
thing burned at the stake.

1126
00:57:26,650 --> 00:57:31,300
And so I think trend what we really need
and I would love to see this,

1127
00:57:31,630 --> 00:57:33,330
you know,
like the,

1128
00:57:33,880 --> 00:57:36,190
like the old new or a public for 
instance.

1129
00:57:36,191 --> 00:57:38,930
I mean the new new republic,
it is this,

1130
00:57:39,460 --> 00:57:42,280
you know,
lamentable,

1131
00:57:42,281 --> 00:57:43,114
you know,
shadow of its former self were avoided 

1132
00:57:44,520 --> 00:57:45,353
that,
I don't know if you saw the other day 

1133
00:57:46,301 --> 00:57:47,134
there,
they had this really bizarre essay 

1134
00:57:50,851 --> 00:57:53,890
called what are white writers for or 
something.

1135
00:57:54,200 --> 00:57:57,900
And Yeah.
And it contained this line,

1136
00:57:57,910 --> 00:58:01,750
which I actually screenshot it on 
twitter that said something like,

1137
00:58:01,751 --> 00:58:02,584
well for the most part white people have
always been able to do everything they 

1138
00:58:06,281 --> 00:58:11,140
want to do.
It is detached from reality.

1139
00:58:11,141 --> 00:58:11,974
I mean really seriously.
And it's like these people don't even 

1140
00:58:14,351 --> 00:58:18,640
realize how profoundly elitist because 
it's like they think.

1141
00:58:18,641 --> 00:58:20,830
And the guy who wrote this as a Yale 
Grad,

1142
00:58:20,890 --> 00:58:21,723
you know,
so you think that your experience as a 

1143
00:58:24,371 --> 00:58:29,290
writer who went to Yale,
it because your wife is identical to the

1144
00:58:29,291 --> 00:58:34,280
experience of some white guy who lives 
in Kentucky and as good of a job.

1145
00:58:34,280 --> 00:58:36,160
But it was going to vote for trump by 
the way,

1146
00:58:36,310 --> 00:58:38,740
because you people keep telling him 
that,

1147
00:58:38,741 --> 00:58:39,574
you know,
he is a racist because he is not happy 

1148
00:58:41,921 --> 00:58:45,900
with where he is in life and he knows 
that,

1149
00:58:46,280 --> 00:58:48,260
you know,
what I think we really,

1150
00:58:48,490 --> 00:58:53,490
really need more voices for this kind of
liberalism that doesn't,

1151
00:58:55,630 --> 00:58:57,730
you know,
both moderate conservatism,

1152
00:58:57,731 --> 00:58:59,310
which I think has been,
you know,

1153
00:58:59,530 --> 00:59:01,580
largely edge down these days.
But,

1154
00:59:01,581 --> 00:59:02,860
you know,
the rush limbaughs.

1155
00:59:02,861 --> 00:59:06,590
And so I think,
I mean,

1156
00:59:07,090 --> 00:59:07,923
national review I think still has some 
really good kind of a national review 

1157
00:59:11,351 --> 00:59:13,420
commentary.
Um,

1158
00:59:13,450 --> 00:59:14,200
you know,
those,

1159
00:59:14,200 --> 00:59:18,460
those publications have some really good
kind of traditional conservative voices.

1160
00:59:20,080 --> 00:59:20,913
But I think we're really,
really need more of that and we're 

1161
00:59:23,260 --> 00:59:27,920
needed more liberal,
a liberal will publications,

1162
00:59:27,940 --> 00:59:30,190
uh,
that consistently advanced

1163
00:59:30,280 --> 00:59:32,910
a liberal law point of view.
You know,

1164
00:59:32,980 --> 00:59:33,813
I really liked what you said about this,
this new thing for me because I've been 

1165
00:59:36,881 --> 00:59:37,714
sort of talking about a little bit and 
I've had a few guests that have 

1166
00:59:39,191 --> 00:59:40,024
mentioned it and I've been saying for 
awhile that it seems to me that 

1167
00:59:41,861 --> 00:59:46,180
defending my liberal values is now 
becoming a conservative position.

1168
00:59:46,510 --> 00:59:48,850
That doesn't make me feel good to say 
that.

1169
00:59:48,890 --> 00:59:49,723
But,
but I think that shows that there's a 

1170
00:59:50,651 --> 00:59:52,810
bridge to be built here.
I want to back up to something else that

1171
00:59:52,811 --> 00:59:53,644
you said,
which is that everything's being 

1172
00:59:54,191 --> 00:59:55,024
politicized these days.
Because yesterday I saw on twitter 

1173
00:59:58,210 --> 01:00:01,360
somebody tweeted that the,
the lead actress in the show,

1174
01:00:01,361 --> 01:00:02,840
blackish,
uh,

1175
01:00:02,860 --> 01:00:05,350
which has doubled the ratings I suppose.
I guess,

1176
01:00:05,351 --> 01:00:07,270
of,
of Tim Allen's newer show.

1177
01:00:07,271 --> 01:00:09,520
Not home improvement.
The one that's on now.

1178
01:00:09,850 --> 01:00:10,683
And it said that he makes something like
20 times more than him and what the 

1179
01:00:14,021 --> 01:00:14,854
implication was with somehow that he as 
a white man is making more than this 

1180
01:00:19,060 --> 01:00:22,000
black woman.
And I think that line in general is just

1181
01:00:22,250 --> 01:00:24,790
a misguided way of attacking.
But it was really.

1182
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:28,540
They were trying to solve some sort of 
social injustice,

1183
01:00:28,730 --> 01:00:32,400
but really Tim Allen is a massive star 
who I think,

1184
01:00:32,410 --> 01:00:34,650
if I'm not mistaken,
it's been around for name.

1185
01:00:35,260 --> 01:00:36,093
He's the only person ever to have a 
number one movie number one book and 

1186
01:00:38,171 --> 01:00:41,470
number one second of all at the same.
We're all the same week.

1187
01:00:41,560 --> 01:00:42,393
So this is a massive star who's reaping 
the benefits of being the headline guy 

1188
01:00:45,611 --> 01:00:46,444
in a sycamore.

1189
01:00:46,640 --> 01:00:48,260
Oprah Winfrey,
I'm sure,

1190
01:00:48,261 --> 01:00:50,530
makes a lot more money than you do.

1191
01:00:52,330 --> 01:00:56,920
Believe it or not exactly.
Sure how the Youtube CPM work out.

1192
01:00:56,921 --> 01:00:59,140
But yes she does.
And I'm a white guy.

1193
01:00:59,200 --> 01:01:00,400
Ah,
what does that prove?

1194
01:01:00,430 --> 01:01:01,860
There you go.
But,

1195
01:01:01,950 --> 01:01:04,570
but that idea that everything is 
politicized,

1196
01:01:04,590 --> 01:01:05,860
it's,
it's really dangerous,

1197
01:01:05,861 --> 01:01:07,640
right?
As someone that comes from absolute,

1198
01:01:07,990 --> 01:01:08,980
everything was political.

1199
01:01:09,080 --> 01:01:10,220
Absolutely.
And,

1200
01:01:10,221 --> 01:01:11,160
and,
and it's,

1201
01:01:11,180 --> 01:01:15,620
it's really,
really discouraging to me to see,

1202
01:01:15,621 --> 01:01:18,230
especially a lot of the cultural 
criticism,

1203
01:01:18,740 --> 01:01:22,310
a couch completely in these political 
terms.

1204
01:01:22,680 --> 01:01:23,900
Uh,
it's like,

1205
01:01:23,901 --> 01:01:24,734
you know,
you can read a random review of some TV 

1206
01:01:28,461 --> 01:01:33,410
show and suddenly you see a lot in a 
long the lines of,

1207
01:01:33,620 --> 01:01:34,610
well,
of course,

1208
01:01:34,611 --> 01:01:35,510
you know,
in,

1209
01:01:35,580 --> 01:01:37,660
in the rape culture of,
you know,

1210
01:01:37,730 --> 01:01:40,920
modern American society,
men,

1211
01:01:40,940 --> 01:01:43,650
women are systematically suppressed,
you know,

1212
01:01:43,850 --> 01:01:46,370
cannot express their wishes freely.
And so,

1213
01:01:46,840 --> 01:01:47,930
you know,
and it's like,

1214
01:01:48,410 --> 01:01:52,820
it reminds me of how when I was growing 
up in the Soviet Union,

1215
01:01:52,821 --> 01:01:54,440
you know,
going back to that experience,

1216
01:01:54,980 --> 01:01:59,980
I had these additions of classics like 
Shakespeare in translation and there was

1217
01:02:00,291 --> 01:02:05,291
a kind of obligatory thing where 
virtually any publication of,

1218
01:02:07,401 --> 01:02:08,234
um,
of a classic had to have a forward that 

1219
01:02:13,820 --> 01:02:14,653
had to have at least some passages that 
put it in the proper kind of Marxist 

1220
01:02:18,020 --> 01:02:18,853
context.

1221
01:02:19,420 --> 01:02:20,253
A warning before trigger will trigger 
warning so much as kind of an 

1222
01:02:24,930 --> 01:02:27,630
ideological framework that told you,
you know,

1223
01:02:27,640 --> 01:02:29,430
what the correct weight are we.
That was.

1224
01:02:29,610 --> 01:02:30,750
So for instance,
you know,

1225
01:02:30,751 --> 01:02:35,751
Shakespeare's King Lear is really about 
the emergence of the bourgeoisie and its

1226
01:02:36,240 --> 01:02:37,660
replacement.
Uh,

1227
01:02:38,330 --> 01:02:40,870
you know,
the feudal family system.

1228
01:02:41,150 --> 01:02:44,440
So on and uh,
and it really has,

1229
01:02:44,450 --> 01:02:45,283
and there would be a quote from either 
mark's or London and it was funny 

1230
01:02:48,451 --> 01:02:49,284
because apparently in the Russian 
publishing industry I've heard people 

1231
01:02:53,101 --> 01:02:57,750
actually used to refer to these Marx and
Lenin quotes as locomotives because they

1232
01:02:57,751 --> 01:03:00,480
were like pulling the,
throw the publication of the book,

1233
01:03:01,040 --> 01:03:01,873
you know,
and you couldn't get the book published 

1234
01:03:03,031 --> 01:03:04,230
otherwise.
So,

1235
01:03:04,231 --> 01:03:07,650
and it's not necessarily the person who 
wrote the foreword believed any of that.

1236
01:03:07,651 --> 01:03:08,484
I will just this obligatory nod to the 
reigning ideology and I think we're 

1237
01:03:13,501 --> 01:03:14,334
almost getting to the point where you 
look at a lot of TV movie book reviews 

1238
01:03:18,240 --> 01:03:20,160
in a,
you know,

1239
01:03:20,161 --> 01:03:20,994
kind of progressive left of center 
publications and it's the same kind of 

1240
01:03:24,121 --> 01:03:24,871
stuff,
you know,

1241
01:03:24,871 --> 01:03:26,730
you see these,
you know,

1242
01:03:26,731 --> 01:03:30,240
references to the race,
gender,

1243
01:03:30,500 --> 01:03:32,370
you know,
sexuality,

1244
01:03:32,371 --> 01:03:33,780
identity,
politics,

1245
01:03:33,781 --> 01:03:37,350
ideology,
a that permeates everything.

1246
01:03:37,610 --> 01:03:39,720
And uh,
and it's scary,

1247
01:03:40,680 --> 01:03:41,513
especially in terms of gender and gender
issues and relations between men and 

1248
01:03:45,541 --> 01:03:46,930
women.
Uh,

1249
01:03:46,950 --> 01:03:49,230
we haven't even gotten to the thought,
you know,

1250
01:03:49,231 --> 01:03:52,050
I've been doing a lot of writing on 
gender.

1251
01:03:53,520 --> 01:03:54,880
Unfortunately.
We're out of time.

1252
01:03:54,920 --> 01:03:56,690
So you absolutely are going to come 
back,

1253
01:03:56,691 --> 01:03:58,790
whether you like it or not,
I'm not forcing you to come back,

1254
01:03:59,270 --> 01:04:02,710
do time next time we're going to do a 
full hour of gender issues,

1255
01:04:02,750 --> 01:04:05,090
do all the gender is feminism and men 
rights and all that.

1256
01:04:05,091 --> 01:04:05,924
But I,
I really do love how you brought this 

1257
01:04:06,741 --> 01:04:07,574
back to where we started because the 
themes of being in a society that are 

1258
01:04:10,701 --> 01:04:11,534
closed,
we're in an open one now and someone 

1259
01:04:13,671 --> 01:04:15,900
like you that's lived through the other 
side can,

1260
01:04:15,940 --> 01:04:19,280
can see some of the frameworks of it 
happening here.

1261
01:04:19,430 --> 01:04:20,950
So that's why I'm glad that we brought 
her in.

1262
01:04:20,951 --> 01:04:22,130
So I'll give you the last word.

1263
01:04:22,530 --> 01:04:23,191
Well,
I mean,

1264
01:04:23,191 --> 01:04:24,160
I think he,
the,

1265
01:04:24,180 --> 01:04:25,013
he made a really good point about how we
have an open society that as suddenly 

1266
01:04:29,371 --> 01:04:30,204
somehow reproducing a lot of these 
thought patterns of closed society is a 

1267
01:04:35,191 --> 01:04:38,880
society is where there is a dominant 
ideology.

1268
01:04:39,210 --> 01:04:42,720
And I think that is something that we 
all have to be very,

1269
01:04:42,721 --> 01:04:44,580
very leery of.
Um,

1270
01:04:44,640 --> 01:04:46,160
I think,
you know,

1271
01:04:46,630 --> 01:04:51,630
the saying the world exclusively through
a political slash ideological lens,

1272
01:04:52,500 --> 01:04:54,420
uh,
is a really,

1273
01:04:54,421 --> 01:04:55,254
really limited and skewed way of looking
at the world and it also really keeps 

1274
01:05:01,441 --> 01:05:04,140
you from looking at the opposing point 
of view because,

1275
01:05:04,530 --> 01:05:05,280
you know,
if,

1276
01:05:05,280 --> 01:05:09,810
if a point of view that is different 
from yours is not just a different point

1277
01:05:09,811 --> 01:05:11,550
of view,
but the enemy,

1278
01:05:12,240 --> 01:05:13,051
uh,
you know,

1279
01:05:13,051 --> 01:05:16,170
that is really not a,
no,

1280
01:05:16,250 --> 01:05:17,083
that is really not very conducive to 
getting a full picture of what's going 

1281
01:05:20,951 --> 01:05:23,200
on in the world.
And I think that applies by the way,

1282
01:05:23,201 --> 01:05:24,034
again,
to a lot of people on the right as well 

1283
01:05:25,391 --> 01:05:27,550
as people in the love.
I think that,

1284
01:05:27,551 --> 01:05:30,160
you know,
the right kind of has its own version of

1285
01:05:30,161 --> 01:05:31,030
political,
correct.

1286
01:05:31,060 --> 01:05:33,260
No,
I'm not defending the right.

1287
01:05:34,090 --> 01:05:34,923
Absolutely.

1288
01:05:35,940 --> 01:05:37,170
Yeah.
So,

1289
01:05:37,171 --> 01:05:38,280
you know,
I think we,

1290
01:05:38,290 --> 01:05:38,850
uh,
yeah,

1291
01:05:38,850 --> 01:05:43,590
and I'm gonna repeat it again.
I think we need to add my own politics.

1292
01:05:43,640 --> 01:05:48,640
Quite a moderate libertarian really.
I'm not extremely doctrinaire about,

1293
01:05:49,090 --> 01:05:50,760
you know,
minimal government.

1294
01:05:50,761 --> 01:05:51,594
I mean,
I obviously think less government is 

1295
01:05:53,431 --> 01:05:54,630
better,
but you know,

1296
01:05:54,631 --> 01:05:55,464
I'm probably not quite as a minimalistic
about government or some of my 

1297
01:05:59,611 --> 01:06:01,020
colleagues that reason.
Sure.

1298
01:06:01,070 --> 01:06:01,531
Uh,
I mean,

1299
01:06:01,531 --> 01:06:04,800
I think that there are legitimate 
disagreements that we can have about,

1300
01:06:04,830 --> 01:06:06,300
you know,
the size of government,

1301
01:06:06,301 --> 01:06:07,134
about welfare programs.
These are all legitimate subject for 

1302
01:06:09,841 --> 01:06:11,250
discussion.
Uh,

1303
01:06:11,340 --> 01:06:13,980
as long as you know,
you,

1304
01:06:13,981 --> 01:06:17,430
you understand that your point of view 
could be wrong,

1305
01:06:17,431 --> 01:06:18,264
you know,
that you're not necessarily write about 

1306
01:06:19,501 --> 01:06:21,440
everything.
And you know,

1307
01:06:21,450 --> 01:06:22,283
unfortunately the identity politics are 
a whole different ballgame because 

1308
01:06:25,591 --> 01:06:29,580
unlike the debates about the nature of 
the welfare state,

1309
01:06:29,581 --> 01:06:32,010
for instance,
identity politics,

1310
01:06:32,130 --> 01:06:34,800
uh,
does turn to put people in boxes.

1311
01:06:34,950 --> 01:06:38,910
Identity politics tends to demonize the 
opposition.

1312
01:06:39,270 --> 01:06:40,470
And,
uh,

1313
01:06:40,700 --> 01:06:41,410
the,
the,

1314
01:06:41,410 --> 01:06:43,740
uh,
the social justice ideology,

1315
01:06:43,741 --> 01:06:44,680
uh,
that,

1316
01:06:44,730 --> 01:06:45,563
uh,
a really kind of seeks to control how 

1317
01:06:47,791 --> 01:06:50,730
people even talk about identity and 
related issues.

1318
01:06:51,050 --> 01:06:54,270
And that's a whole difference.
And that's a whole different story.

1319
01:06:54,271 --> 01:06:56,070
And this is where,
you know,

1320
01:06:56,071 --> 01:06:56,904
I,
I don't think it's really possible to 

1321
01:06:57,991 --> 01:07:02,991
conduct a dialogue with people who 
espouse to Terry and ideology.

1322
01:07:03,760 --> 01:07:05,920
I'm going to keep trying.
And you absolutely,

1323
01:07:05,921 --> 01:07:08,670
you're coming back where we're going to 
get interested in as I last,

1324
01:07:08,671 --> 01:07:10,750
I like to say on a good interview.
I don't even look at these ones.

1325
01:07:10,751 --> 01:07:12,670
I didn't pick them up once,
so it was a pleasure.

1326
01:07:12,671 --> 01:07:13,504
Thanks for coming.
Thanks for coming to La and doing this 

1327
01:07:15,221 --> 01:07:18,100
and finally meet you and I really want 
to do this again.

1328
01:07:18,130 --> 01:07:18,963
We're actually,
we're real people in more than 140 

1329
01:07:20,201 --> 01:07:21,190
characters.
I can't believe it.

1330
