1
00:00:05,180 --> 00:00:07,910
With the Christmas season upon us,
let's recap the year today,

2
00:00:07,911 --> 00:00:11,450
both for the wider world as well as the 
great community that we've built here at

3
00:00:11,451 --> 00:00:12,860
the Rubin report.
Note,

4
00:00:12,861 --> 00:00:13,694
I did say Christmas season.
They're not holiday season or winter 

5
00:00:16,491 --> 00:00:20,270
spectacular or whatever else the PC 
crowd wants us to say these days.

6
00:00:20,660 --> 00:00:24,620
The fact is that the wide majority of 
people in the United States do celebrate

7
00:00:24,621 --> 00:00:27,350
Christmas and whether you celebrate it 
or not,

8
00:00:27,351 --> 00:00:28,184
there is goodness to be had in the 
spirit of the season like being kind to 

9
00:00:31,461 --> 00:00:34,940
your fellow man when someone wishes you 
a merry Christmas.

10
00:00:34,941 --> 00:00:37,780
That is not an affront to Hanukah,
Kwanza,

11
00:00:37,790 --> 00:00:39,980
Festivus,
or the cycle of the planets.

12
00:00:40,340 --> 00:00:41,173
In many cases,
probably most cases wishing someone a 

13
00:00:43,521 --> 00:00:44,354
merry Christmas is more of just an 
acknowledgement of the holiday season 

14
00:00:47,871 --> 00:00:49,940
rather than some sort of religious 
edict.

15
00:00:50,450 --> 00:00:51,620
Of course,
by the same token,

16
00:00:51,621 --> 00:00:52,454
if you're offended that someone wished 
you happy holidays instead of Merry 

17
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:56,833
Christmas,
perhaps your offense meter is out of 

18
00:00:58,131 --> 00:00:58,460
whack.

19
00:00:58,460 --> 00:00:59,293
To the point is that it's the end of the
year in 2016 has been particularly 

20
00:01:03,801 --> 00:01:04,634
divisive,
so let's try to find some joy in one 

21
00:01:06,981 --> 00:01:07,814
another and wish good tidings even to 
people who weren't that good to us this 

22
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:12,913
past year on the world front.
20 16 will go down as one of the 

23
00:01:15,261 --> 00:01:19,370
craziest years ever.
Donald trump becoming the next president

24
00:01:19,371 --> 00:01:22,070
of the United States was clearly the 
biggest story,

25
00:01:22,310 --> 00:01:26,240
but England choosing brexit instead of 
staying in the European Union as well as

26
00:01:26,241 --> 00:01:29,090
the continued humanitarian disaster in 
Syria.

27
00:01:29,270 --> 00:01:33,350
We'll all have major impacts as we move 
into 2017 and beyond.

28
00:01:33,980 --> 00:01:34,813
More than anything else though.
Twenty 16 taught us that at least here 

29
00:01:37,401 --> 00:01:38,234
in the west,
the power is still with the people in 

30
00:01:41,241 --> 00:01:45,530
both trump's win and the brexit vote.
The vast majority of the media,

31
00:01:45,531 --> 00:01:47,090
the elites,
the establishment,

32
00:01:47,091 --> 00:01:50,420
and the money was on the other side.
Yet despite this,

33
00:01:50,450 --> 00:01:54,260
the people rose up and change the course
of the world with their votes.

34
00:01:54,620 --> 00:01:55,453
Now,
you may not like the results of either 

35
00:01:56,481 --> 00:02:00,080
of those two events and you may not be 
happy with the electoral college or with

36
00:02:00,081 --> 00:02:00,914
the tactics of the brexit tiers,
but you have to acknowledge that there 

37
00:02:04,171 --> 00:02:05,004
is something amazing and the ability of 
people in a western democracy to truly 

38
00:02:08,781 --> 00:02:13,010
control their own destiny.
Most people on Earth would give anything

39
00:02:13,011 --> 00:02:16,340
to have this much control over the 
system that they live in.

40
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:17,593
In fact,
the revolutions which swept throughout 

41
00:02:19,101 --> 00:02:19,934
the Middle East over the past few years,
we're done with the hopes that the 

42
00:02:22,761 --> 00:02:23,594
people could one day have as much sway 
over their leaders as we have in the 

43
00:02:27,141 --> 00:02:27,974
West right now.
While these revolutions haven't worked 

44
00:02:30,261 --> 00:02:31,094
out as planned,
the seeds of freedom had been planted 

45
00:02:33,890 --> 00:02:35,690
and even if Egypt,
Libya,

46
00:02:35,691 --> 00:02:38,900
and obviously Syria,
rn is free as we want them to be.

47
00:02:39,170 --> 00:02:42,800
The ideas of freedom have taken root 
thanks to the Internet.

48
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:45,770
Most of us now walk around with the 
world in our pocket.

49
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:50,060
We're connected in incredible ways,
changing the world right in front of us.

50
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:53,570
No longer do we have to get our 
information from only a few sources.

51
00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:54,733
Now,
any and all of us can be a source of 

52
00:02:56,301 --> 00:02:58,850
information all over the globe.
Of course,

53
00:02:58,860 --> 00:03:03,490
this barrier to entry creates other 
problems like who can we actually trust,

54
00:03:03,820 --> 00:03:04,653
but I would always veer on the side of 
having access to more information than 

55
00:03:07,811 --> 00:03:08,644
less information.
Just look at how the mainstream media 

56
00:03:10,781 --> 00:03:15,250
has reacted to the trump win.
Did they offer us any real introspection

57
00:03:15,251 --> 00:03:17,560
and reevaluate their tactics and 
methods?

58
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:18,790
No,
of course not.

59
00:03:19,060 --> 00:03:19,893
Instead they doubled down on identity 
politics and name calling and at the 

60
00:03:23,201 --> 00:03:24,034
same time the mainstream media told us 
that anything that's sanctioned by them 

61
00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:28,533
is fake news.
When the very people who invented fake 

62
00:03:31,451 --> 00:03:32,284
news or warning you about fake news,
well you know the tide is beginning to 

63
00:03:35,441 --> 00:03:36,274
turn.

64
00:03:37,180 --> 00:03:38,013
The issue is that I've tried to 
highlight over the past year from the 

65
00:03:40,421 --> 00:03:41,254
importance of free speech to having 
honest political discourse really 

66
00:03:44,291 --> 00:03:48,010
encompass everything which moved our 
world in 2016,

67
00:03:48,370 --> 00:03:52,510
the stifling of free speech by using 
cries of racism and bigotry.

68
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:53,473
Shut down honest conversation about 
relevant topics like Islamism and 

69
00:03:57,461 --> 00:04:01,120
immigration.
There's a direct line from that stifling

70
00:04:01,121 --> 00:04:05,440
of hard but important conversations that
led us to brexit and trump.

71
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:06,873
Couple the inability or unwillingness to
have difficult conversations about 

72
00:04:10,241 --> 00:04:11,074
important issues with the hyper partisan
fighting that we now have where people 

73
00:04:14,741 --> 00:04:18,700
literally drop friends and family 
members over political disagreements and

74
00:04:18,701 --> 00:04:19,534
you have a toxic stew.
Having honest conversations without 

75
00:04:22,721 --> 00:04:23,554
resorting to demagoguery will be trump's
biggest challenge and it's one that I 

76
00:04:26,831 --> 00:04:30,340
hope that he will succeed at.
We know that trump's good at winning,

77
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:31,353
but will he be gracious enough to 
understand that his win isn't just for 

78
00:04:34,181 --> 00:04:35,014
himself and his supporters,
but also for the people who voted 

79
00:04:38,201 --> 00:04:40,690
against him,
even if they're still shouting about it?

80
00:04:40,690 --> 00:04:41,860
Right?
This very second.

81
00:04:42,490 --> 00:04:46,330
I really believe that if trump focuses 
on the economy and infrastructure,

82
00:04:46,510 --> 00:04:50,410
if he doesn't get us involved in 
unnecessary military conflicts and if he

83
00:04:50,411 --> 00:04:51,244
unleashes the tech sector,
that we could have another American 

84
00:04:53,771 --> 00:04:54,604
renaissance.
These are huge gifts amongst many other 

85
00:04:57,371 --> 00:04:58,204
ifs,
but right now if you root for trump to 

86
00:04:59,861 --> 00:05:02,620
fail,
then you root for our country to fail.

87
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:04,473
More important than anything else.
If we had been able to have more honest 

88
00:05:07,301 --> 00:05:08,134
and enlightened conversations in 2016 
than perhaps the world would feel a 

89
00:05:11,291 --> 00:05:14,110
little more sensible than it does right 
now.

90
00:05:14,980 --> 00:05:15,641
You know,
it's funny.

91
00:05:15,641 --> 00:05:18,640
We don't like when people discriminate 
on the basis of religion,

92
00:05:18,641 --> 00:05:19,474
which is simply a set of ideas,
but we have no problem when people 

93
00:05:22,151 --> 00:05:24,730
discriminate based on political 
affiliation,

94
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:25,833
which also is just a set of ideas.
Tolerance of different opinions will be 

95
00:05:29,621 --> 00:05:32,620
our biggest national challenge in 2017.

96
00:05:32,890 --> 00:05:33,723
Accepting that not everyone agrees with 
us all the time and not only is that 

97
00:05:37,091 --> 00:05:37,924
okay,
but it's actually preferable will be 

98
00:05:40,121 --> 00:05:43,390
something that we all have to put into 
action in this coming year.

99
00:05:43,750 --> 00:05:48,190
We had our share of group think in 2016 
because everyone seemed to go into their

100
00:05:48,191 --> 00:05:49,024
little bubbles.
Hopefully 2017 is where we burst them 

101
00:05:52,310 --> 00:05:55,840
and we see what happened.
Joining me this week is Tim Ferriss.

102
00:05:55,870 --> 00:05:56,703
Tim is no stranger talking to people 
from every walk of life and from every 

103
00:06:00,231 --> 00:06:02,360
corner of the globe.
His podcast,

104
00:06:02,361 --> 00:06:03,194
the Tim Ferriss show,
is over 100 million downloads and he's 

105
00:06:05,691 --> 00:06:06,524
chatted with people from Sam Harris and 
Arnold Schwartzenegger to Tim Robbins 

106
00:06:10,431 --> 00:06:11,264
and Kevin Costner.
He's been described as the oprah of 

107
00:06:13,310 --> 00:06:14,143
podcasting and his new book tools of 
titans is a compilation of some of the 

108
00:06:17,961 --> 00:06:20,960
best habits he's learned from his 
various guests.

109
00:06:21,470 --> 00:06:22,303
It seems fitting to veer into the end of
2016 as an interviewer interviewing an 

110
00:06:26,661 --> 00:06:29,780
interviewer.
If 2016 was the year of outrage,

111
00:06:29,781 --> 00:06:32,870
then let's have 2017 be the year of the 
conversation.

112
00:06:38,460 --> 00:06:40,860
Joining me this week is an author and 
entrepreneur,

113
00:06:40,861 --> 00:06:41,694
a speaker,
and a master of all kinds of cool 

114
00:06:43,501 --> 00:06:46,830
things.
Some have called him the Oprah of audio.

115
00:06:46,950 --> 00:06:48,510
Tim Ferriss.
Welcome to the Rubin report.

116
00:06:49,450 --> 00:06:50,290
Thanks for having me.

117
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:53,780
The Oprah of audio.
How do you like that moniker?

118
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:57,780
Well,
it must be the striking resemblance that

119
00:06:57,781 --> 00:06:58,850
we have.
A,

120
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:01,680
I'm flattered by it.
I think that,

121
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:02,553
uh,
couldn't ask for more flattering 

122
00:07:06,270 --> 00:07:07,103
moniker,
although I think it still remains to be 

123
00:07:09,151 --> 00:07:13,640
seen if I can live up to that.
But it's been a trip and audio,

124
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:16,350
my experimental career in audio.

125
00:07:16,740 --> 00:07:19,830
Have you ever given your audience cars?
Has everyone got in the car yet?

126
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:22,290
I have,
I've not done cars yet.

127
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:25,500
I've done a tee shirts,
mushroom coffee,

128
00:07:25,830 --> 00:07:27,750
and a handful of other lower ticket 
items.

129
00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:30,450
Sometimes sardines,
canned sardines.

130
00:07:30,660 --> 00:07:32,430
Uh,
but not yet.

131
00:07:33,150 --> 00:07:34,950
Cars haven't made my way up to the cars 
yet.

132
00:07:35,110 --> 00:07:35,860
Yeah.
Sardines.

133
00:07:35,860 --> 00:07:36,693
Very good for you.
And we're going to talk about some of 

134
00:07:37,811 --> 00:07:40,540
the things that you've given away in 
some of the ideas that you,

135
00:07:40,541 --> 00:07:42,430
uh,
that you push amongst your crowd.

136
00:07:42,700 --> 00:07:43,533
Uh,
I was feeling undue pressure to ask the 

137
00:07:45,461 --> 00:07:48,010
right questions this week.
I think I'm all right at this,

138
00:07:48,310 --> 00:07:49,060
but I thought,
all right,

139
00:07:49,060 --> 00:07:52,660
Tim Ferriss,
he's known as asking good questions.

140
00:07:52,661 --> 00:07:53,494
So the first question I'm going to go,
I'm going to go abroad with you for a 

141
00:07:55,571 --> 00:07:57,160
number one.
For the person that's watching this,

142
00:07:57,161 --> 00:08:00,010
that has no idea who tim ferriss is,
if that,

143
00:08:00,011 --> 00:08:03,040
if such a person exists,
what would you say is,

144
00:08:03,070 --> 00:08:05,650
what is the mission of Tim Ferriss?

145
00:08:07,060 --> 00:08:07,893
Tim Ferriss is a self experimenter who 
runs experiments with the help of some 

146
00:08:13,511 --> 00:08:16,210
of the world's top performers.
Could be scientists,

147
00:08:16,211 --> 00:08:18,640
could be athletes,
could be entrepreneurs,

148
00:08:18,641 --> 00:08:19,510
ceos,
etc.

149
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:20,673
And then writes about the results so 
that readers can have the cliff notes 

150
00:08:23,410 --> 00:08:28,410
version and that is really the gist of 
it.

151
00:08:28,900 --> 00:08:31,480
Out All of my experiments work out as 
planned,

152
00:08:31,481 --> 00:08:32,314
which make for entertaining reading and 
a tragic injury on my part in some 

153
00:08:36,071 --> 00:08:36,904
cases,
but generally speaking I view myself as 

154
00:08:38,820 --> 00:08:43,820
as an experimentalist and a teacher,
not primarily writer and it is my job to

155
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:45,633
push the extremes and do all of that 
heavy lifting so that my readers do not 

156
00:08:49,181 --> 00:08:49,860
have to.

157
00:08:49,860 --> 00:08:51,540
When did you get interested in all of 
this?

158
00:08:51,541 --> 00:08:54,270
Was there a point like when you were in 
high school or junior high,

159
00:08:54,271 --> 00:08:55,104
were you always the limits of what you 
could do and trying to figure out what 

160
00:08:58,201 --> 00:08:59,034
was next

161
00:08:59,060 --> 00:09:02,810
in a sense?
I was starting probably around age 13,

162
00:09:02,811 --> 00:09:05,070
14 and that was competitive wrestling.
uh,

163
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:08,810
I was put into kiddie wrestling when I 
was probably 10 by.

164
00:09:08,811 --> 00:09:09,644
My mom was very hyperactive and other 
moms recommended that as a way to 

165
00:09:12,740 --> 00:09:16,760
diffuse things and a drain my batteries.
But I was also a very,

166
00:09:16,761 --> 00:09:17,594
very small.
I was born premature and I was very 

167
00:09:19,041 --> 00:09:19,874
small up until about sixth grade and in 
this case you had weight classes so the 

168
00:09:24,141 --> 00:09:24,974
60 pound weaklings could battle the 
other 60 pound weaklings and someone 

169
00:09:27,081 --> 00:09:27,914
could come out on top and as I moved 
further ahead and got better at 

170
00:09:30,831 --> 00:09:34,130
wrestling,
I realized there was a huge advantage in

171
00:09:34,310 --> 00:09:35,143
a recording your workouts and training 
approaches be recording the technical 

172
00:09:39,531 --> 00:09:42,080
practice and see getting very good at 
weight cutting,

173
00:09:42,170 --> 00:09:45,530
so actually become very,
very good at cutting weight,

174
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:46,393
which I don't recommend.
It's not a healthy thing to do because 

175
00:09:48,201 --> 00:09:49,850
it's primarily dehydration,
but

176
00:09:50,810 --> 00:09:53,590
you literally would not drink water 
right for,

177
00:09:53,620 --> 00:09:54,453
for.
Was it just a couple of days before and 

178
00:09:55,671 --> 00:09:58,230
then right before the match you'd like 
down hold?

179
00:09:58,270 --> 00:09:59,103
Yeah,
no water.

180
00:09:59,500 --> 00:09:59,910
Yeah,
you,

181
00:09:59,910 --> 00:10:00,743
you dehydrate and then rehydrate.
so I would actually cut from my senior 

182
00:10:03,101 --> 00:10:03,934
year one 78 to 1:52
is 26 pounds twice a week and that was 

183
00:10:07,451 --> 00:10:12,220
done between 12 and 18 hours.
To do that without ever having some type

184
00:10:12,221 --> 00:10:13,054
of organ failure,
you have to get a good basic 

185
00:10:15,071 --> 00:10:17,710
understanding of sodium,
potassium.

186
00:10:17,770 --> 00:10:20,380
how all of these things work together so
you don't really,

187
00:10:20,381 --> 00:10:21,214
really damage yourself,
but I saw the rewards there from 

188
00:10:24,881 --> 00:10:25,714
documentation and experimentation and 
then later to start applying that to 

189
00:10:28,841 --> 00:10:29,674
everything.

190
00:10:29,790 --> 00:10:31,910
Yeah.
so in a weird way you were sorta,

191
00:10:31,940 --> 00:10:34,350
you were kind of like a scientist as a 
kid.

192
00:10:34,351 --> 00:10:35,184
YOu were using your own body as the,
As the experiment and you were 

193
00:10:38,041 --> 00:10:40,230
documenting everything and kind of 
seeing what worked.

194
00:10:40,870 --> 00:10:41,703
Yeah,
that's right.

195
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:46,180
And actually went to high school with 
the son of george plimpton,

196
00:10:46,181 --> 00:10:49,060
who I only really came to appreciate 
later as one of the first,

197
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:50,433
I guess you could call them a fully 
immersive participatory journalists who 

198
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:54,313
would try to play a professional 
football game or box someone like a 

199
00:10:57,760 --> 00:10:58,593
sonny liston for a few rounds and then 
write about the experiment about the 

200
00:11:00,881 --> 00:11:02,350
experience.
so this is,

201
00:11:02,410 --> 00:11:04,930
this is not a new tradition.
A lot of people have done it,

202
00:11:04,931 --> 00:11:05,764
but I think that I was one of the first 
two at least popularized really taking 

203
00:11:09,341 --> 00:11:11,160
the physical component,
uh,

204
00:11:11,260 --> 00:11:13,330
to an extreme degree.
But all the,

205
00:11:13,331 --> 00:11:16,600
all the principles can be applied or 
many of them can be applied to the world

206
00:11:16,630 --> 00:11:17,463
of business.
They can be applied to the world of say 

207
00:11:20,140 --> 00:11:20,973
education.
The language learning the principles 

208
00:11:22,420 --> 00:11:23,200
are,
are,

209
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:24,280
are very flexible.

210
00:11:24,590 --> 00:11:25,423
Yeah.
So the four hour work week I think was 

211
00:11:27,051 --> 00:11:28,940
really the first thing that put you on 
the map in a,

212
00:11:28,941 --> 00:11:31,100
in a bigger sense.
Uh,

213
00:11:31,190 --> 00:11:31,711
you know,
I,

214
00:11:31,711 --> 00:11:33,590
I saw you a couple of weeks ago,
we had dinner.

215
00:11:33,591 --> 00:11:34,880
I was worried about,
you know,

216
00:11:35,300 --> 00:11:37,760
can I eat carbs in front of him or 
whatever.

217
00:11:37,761 --> 00:11:39,890
You were very nonjudgmental.
I appreciate that.

218
00:11:40,150 --> 00:11:42,350
Um,
but for me,

219
00:11:42,351 --> 00:11:44,450
I've been building this studio for the 
last month.

220
00:11:44,451 --> 00:11:48,440
I have had one of the craziest month in 
my 40 years on earth.

221
00:11:48,441 --> 00:11:50,330
I mean,
my eating habits have been terrible.

222
00:11:50,331 --> 00:11:51,930
I literally haven't been to the gym and 
um,

223
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:55,150
I just have not had a moment to,
to get any of that.

224
00:11:55,151 --> 00:11:57,190
Right.
So what would you say to somebody that's

225
00:11:57,191 --> 00:11:58,024
really when you're in the thick of it,
when life is actually just you're just 

226
00:12:01,331 --> 00:12:03,190
thrown in the river and you just gotta 
go,

227
00:12:03,191 --> 00:12:05,890
you can't fight the current and it's for
something that you want to do.

228
00:12:06,070 --> 00:12:08,880
How would you recommend I manage some of
this,

229
00:12:08,910 --> 00:12:11,320
this time and stress and all this stuff?

230
00:12:12,060 --> 00:12:12,893
Well,
I would think that there are a few 

231
00:12:14,731 --> 00:12:19,731
different questions that I tend to 
depend on in situations like that.

232
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:24,030
So for instance,
I mean I just,

233
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:24,953
I just completed a 700 page book in less
than four months and that's for me 

234
00:12:31,381 --> 00:12:32,214
unheard of.
All of my book projects had been three 

235
00:12:33,541 --> 00:12:36,780
years.
And you're working with.

236
00:12:37,380 --> 00:12:37,980
Yeah,
the font,

237
00:12:37,980 --> 00:12:42,980
it was like four words.
The page laid out beautifully and the,

238
00:12:44,070 --> 00:12:47,880
the question that I returned to 
frequently was what would this look like

239
00:12:47,881 --> 00:12:48,714
if it were easy or what might this look 
like if it were easy and brainstorming 

240
00:12:53,521 --> 00:12:56,400
seemingly absurd answers to questions.
Like,

241
00:12:56,401 --> 00:12:58,470
what if I had to write this book in a 
week?

242
00:12:58,890 --> 00:13:00,810
I knew I wasn't going to attempt to 
write it in a week,

243
00:13:00,811 --> 00:13:03,960
but what if I had to add a gun against 
my head and you can,

244
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:04,913
you can generate ideas that fall outside
of your current constraints that you've 

245
00:13:09,151 --> 00:13:10,680
applied,
if that makes any sense.

246
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:13,050
So in the case of building a studio,
in the case of say,

247
00:13:13,650 --> 00:13:18,420
recording my podcast,
I very often am trying to prevent the,

248
00:13:18,710 --> 00:13:23,280
I think very natural tendency towards 
complexity and sophistication,

249
00:13:23,790 --> 00:13:24,760
which,
uh,

250
00:13:24,930 --> 00:13:25,763
oftentimes I think that whether it's 
building a studio or writing a book and 

251
00:13:28,411 --> 00:13:29,244
there are benefits to this,
I don't want to discount the value of 

252
00:13:30,811 --> 00:13:31,644
what I'm about to say.
But I remember when I was writing my 

253
00:13:33,121 --> 00:13:36,420
second book and I told an author friend 
of mine,

254
00:13:37,140 --> 00:13:38,550
well,
90 percent done.

255
00:13:38,551 --> 00:13:39,181
And he goes,
well,

256
00:13:39,181 --> 00:13:41,040
congratulations.
You only have half left.

257
00:13:42,870 --> 00:13:43,703
And uh,
sometimes it makes sense to put in that 

258
00:13:45,361 --> 00:13:46,194
last 10 percent.
Other times it makes sense to actually 

259
00:13:48,151 --> 00:13:52,380
get started and experiment with less 
than perfect.

260
00:13:52,510 --> 00:13:53,280
Uh,
and that's,

261
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:55,950
it's very context dependent,
but those would be a few,

262
00:13:56,550 --> 00:13:59,100
a meta kind of approaches that have 
taking.

263
00:13:59,140 --> 00:14:01,350
And then you,
you can also apply certainly things like

264
00:14:01,380 --> 00:14:03,630
the 80 slash 20 principle to just about 
anything,

265
00:14:03,631 --> 00:14:06,600
so you have credos law or the 80 slash 
20 principle,

266
00:14:06,601 --> 00:14:08,700
which you could look at it a few 
different ways.

267
00:14:08,700 --> 00:14:11,400
So one is you could ask yourself,
for instance,

268
00:14:12,570 --> 00:14:17,570
what 20 percent of the equipment or 
activities or infrastructure gives me 80

269
00:14:18,271 --> 00:14:20,730
percent of the output that I want in the
case of a studio.

270
00:14:20,850 --> 00:14:22,800
right?
Conversely,

271
00:14:22,830 --> 00:14:23,663
if you've already been working on it for
say a week and you have three weeks 

272
00:14:27,030 --> 00:14:27,863
scheduled left,
you could ask yourself what are the 20 

273
00:14:29,791 --> 00:14:32,720
percent of gear or activities,
uh,

274
00:14:32,730 --> 00:14:33,563
or personnel for that matter who are 
causing 80 percent or more of the 

275
00:14:35,970 --> 00:14:38,180
emotions that I do not want.
And,

276
00:14:38,190 --> 00:14:39,023
and that could create a not to do list 
or a four now omit list to be assessed 

277
00:14:43,411 --> 00:14:46,230
in the future list.
So those are some of the,

278
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:47,233
the tools and frameworks that I would 
tend to use in a situation like that or 

279
00:14:51,100 --> 00:14:54,020
from juggling my real sort of financial 
career as,

280
00:14:54,021 --> 00:14:55,400
as a,
as tech investor.

281
00:14:55,430 --> 00:14:57,140
And then I stopped doing that about a 
year and a half ago,

282
00:14:57,141 --> 00:15:00,230
but in fact the matter is I have a 
portfolio of say 70 companies.

283
00:15:00,770 --> 00:15:03,300
That's a lot to manage in and of itself.
Um,

284
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:04,333
so these,
these are the types of questions that I 

285
00:15:05,451 --> 00:15:07,730
will ask myself and people who are 
running these fast,

286
00:15:07,970 --> 00:15:08,803
growIng companies very often.
How hard is it for you to delegate some 

287
00:15:12,141 --> 00:15:13,970
of that stuff?
So 70 tech companies,

288
00:15:13,971 --> 00:15:15,920
there's a lot going on it,
I would assume,

289
00:15:15,980 --> 00:15:20,660
basically virtually impossible to really
know the nitty gritty of every one.

290
00:15:20,661 --> 00:15:22,970
I'm sure you don't even want to know the
nitty gritty of everyone.

291
00:15:23,090 --> 00:15:25,250
And some are probably more passion 
projects than others.

292
00:15:25,460 --> 00:15:26,293
How easy is it for you to delegate some 
of that and have a core group of people 

293
00:15:29,151 --> 00:15:33,070
to trust that can advise you?
I is,

294
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:36,560
when it comes to the angel investing,
I delegate very little.

295
00:15:36,680 --> 00:15:37,513
I do have a small team who will work 
with companies on very specific aspects 

296
00:15:41,241 --> 00:15:42,074
of say,
conversion optimization or user 

297
00:15:44,091 --> 00:15:46,970
interface,
things like that based on my direction.

298
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:47,833
But I've also phased how I at least 
historically have done investments that 

299
00:15:52,551 --> 00:15:57,551
I only have of those 70 say five to 10 
maximum who actively need my help at any

300
00:15:59,421 --> 00:16:00,254
given point in time.
And the the one of the signs that 

301
00:16:02,891 --> 00:16:05,360
accompany is probably going to do poorly
is this,

302
00:16:05,390 --> 00:16:08,650
if they constantly want your input,
they should.

303
00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:12,170
They should be spending a high 
percentage of that time having their own

304
00:16:12,171 --> 00:16:15,350
opinions and in building mode and if 
they're,

305
00:16:15,380 --> 00:16:17,990
if they're constantly in a sense 
procrastinating,

306
00:16:17,991 --> 00:16:20,600
doing the work by asking for advice,
then you,

307
00:16:20,650 --> 00:16:21,483
you generally take that as a red flag 
because the thing is you're going to go 

308
00:16:25,071 --> 00:16:26,120
sideways.
But I,

309
00:16:26,121 --> 00:16:26,954
I tend to face things that I only have 
five to 10 activity any given point in 

310
00:16:29,211 --> 00:16:31,070
time.
And then I have a,

311
00:16:31,850 --> 00:16:36,850
I would say a process that I impose on 
each of those initial interactions.

312
00:16:36,950 --> 00:16:37,783
So then I'm checking boxes and those 
required typically a fair amount of 

313
00:16:41,511 --> 00:16:44,510
homework and introspection on the part 
of the companies.

314
00:16:44,570 --> 00:16:45,403
So I'm able to pace it in that respect.
It's very rare that I have more than 

315
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:50,833
five companies or a five to 10.
Let's say come to me in a given month 

316
00:16:54,110 --> 00:16:56,940
with any type of time sensitive 
requirement.

317
00:16:57,780 --> 00:16:58,460
They're,
they're,

318
00:16:58,460 --> 00:16:59,293
they're generally pretty thoughtful 
about it and since I'm working in the 

319
00:17:02,090 --> 00:17:02,923
venture backed tech arena,
the best founders and ceos understand 

320
00:17:07,461 --> 00:17:08,294
how to interact with say a board of 
directors and they would treat me not 

321
00:17:11,511 --> 00:17:13,490
quite as a member of the board of 
directors certainly,

322
00:17:13,491 --> 00:17:14,324
but they would understand how to best 
utilize my time because they've done 

323
00:17:17,841 --> 00:17:20,930
that with board members already.
So as the tech guy,

324
00:17:21,140 --> 00:17:25,610
how realistic is silicon valley show?
Oh,

325
00:17:25,611 --> 00:17:28,640
the show.
I think it's spot on and a lot of ways.

326
00:17:28,790 --> 00:17:30,290
Oh yeah.
I think.

327
00:17:30,380 --> 00:17:33,830
I think it is very accurate in a lot of 
respects,

328
00:17:33,831 --> 00:17:37,220
which is why I find it so funny,
especially the second season,

329
00:17:37,221 --> 00:17:39,260
although a lot in the first season as 
well.

330
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:41,113
It is,
it is a uncannily accurate and in a lot 

331
00:17:44,751 --> 00:17:48,200
of respects,
and I don't take that as a bad thing.

332
00:17:48,201 --> 00:17:51,570
I mean silicon valley is a quirky part 
of the world,

333
00:17:51,630 --> 00:17:54,780
but if it weren't quirky it wouldn't be 
what it is.

334
00:17:54,781 --> 00:17:56,280
It wouldn't be able,
I think,

335
00:17:56,310 --> 00:17:59,350
to produce a lot of what it produces and
uh,

336
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:02,820
it's a weird place.
It has its flaws and its foibles,

337
00:18:02,850 --> 00:18:05,980
but that's true of any location where 
you have,

338
00:18:06,030 --> 00:18:08,370
tend to have a mano conversation.
Right?

339
00:18:08,371 --> 00:18:09,204
So if you go to Washington dc and you 
have the motto conversation of 

340
00:18:12,540 --> 00:18:15,210
government and politics,
it's a weird,

341
00:18:15,211 --> 00:18:16,044
weird place.
You go to say los angeles and you have 

342
00:18:18,901 --> 00:18:21,840
in many places the mano conversation of 
entertainment.

343
00:18:22,140 --> 00:18:24,420
That's a really weird,
weird environment.

344
00:18:24,421 --> 00:18:28,590
I would argue weirder in some ways.
Then silicon valley and silicon valley,

345
00:18:28,591 --> 00:18:29,424
of course,
it's texts that you have just as much 

346
00:18:30,901 --> 00:18:35,840
weirdness and a ecentric behavior to put
it politely as,

347
00:18:35,860 --> 00:18:37,250
as all of those other places.
Yeah.

348
00:18:37,410 --> 00:18:38,820
I'm not sure if you'll know the answer 
to this,

349
00:18:38,821 --> 00:18:43,020
but how monotheism mono be monotheistic 
monolithic.

350
00:18:43,021 --> 00:18:45,690
How about that?
A monotheistic would be something else.

351
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:49,620
How monolithic is sort of the political 
think up in silicon valley,

352
00:18:49,621 --> 00:18:50,161
do you think?
Because I,

353
00:18:50,161 --> 00:18:51,660
you know,
over the election,

354
00:18:51,850 --> 00:18:52,683
uh,
there were all these articles written 

355
00:18:53,610 --> 00:18:56,610
about peter teal.
He's the bad boy of silicon valley.

356
00:18:56,611 --> 00:18:57,444
He doesn't think like everybody else.
And it seemed odd to me that they were 

357
00:18:59,941 --> 00:19:00,211
like,
well,

358
00:19:00,211 --> 00:19:01,044
we can find one guy now.
I know he likes putting himself out 

359
00:19:02,941 --> 00:19:03,774
there and he obviously he spoke at the 
rnc and he's backed trump and all that 

360
00:19:06,961 --> 00:19:07,890
stuff.
But is the,

361
00:19:07,891 --> 00:19:11,820
is the political group think they're as 
strong as as it seems to be?

362
00:19:12,870 --> 00:19:15,600
I would say so.
It's a very.

363
00:19:15,630 --> 00:19:18,450
Well,
I may be.

364
00:19:19,340 --> 00:19:22,410
I may be a getting a little above my pay
grade in terms of,

365
00:19:22,490 --> 00:19:26,040
of of subject areas.
This is not an area of expertise for me,

366
00:19:26,041 --> 00:19:26,874
but

367
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:29,433
there is such an echo chamber I think in
silicon valley in many respects or just 

368
00:19:33,041 --> 00:19:33,874
in the,
in the bay area that it's easy for 

369
00:19:36,131 --> 00:19:41,131
everyone there to pat themselves on the 
back in a very aggressive,

370
00:19:42,370 --> 00:19:43,203
hyper liberal slash progressive way and 
look down their nose at what they would 

371
00:19:48,570 --> 00:19:52,120
perceive as the rest of America.
And it's,

372
00:19:52,190 --> 00:19:57,010
it's a noxious and sanctimonious and a 
lot of respects and is also very,

373
00:19:57,011 --> 00:20:01,070
very counterproductive.
So it's,

374
00:20:01,330 --> 00:20:02,163
I mean,
I don't know how far we want to go down 

375
00:20:02,710 --> 00:20:04,360
the political rabbit hole.
We can do it,

376
00:20:04,361 --> 00:20:05,290
but I mean,
there,

377
00:20:05,291 --> 00:20:07,360
there's part of me that feels like,

378
00:20:09,060 --> 00:20:10,300
you know,
I'm probably,

379
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:12,040
I'm going to get myself into trouble 
here,

380
00:20:12,041 --> 00:20:12,874
but it's a spaghetti.
It's a smugness that I think is part of 

381
00:20:15,491 --> 00:20:16,324
the reason why,
and this is someone speaking as I would 

382
00:20:18,371 --> 00:20:18,730
say,
you know,

383
00:20:18,730 --> 00:20:20,650
very socially,
at least liberal person,

384
00:20:21,330 --> 00:20:23,650
uh,
that smugness is part of the reason they

385
00:20:23,651 --> 00:20:24,860
got their teeth kicked in.
Yeah.

386
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:26,630
They,
they,

387
00:20:26,630 --> 00:20:27,463
they went in really underestimating the 
opposition and sort of carp launch 

388
00:20:33,461 --> 00:20:34,294
writing off everybody who was leaning 
towards trump as stupid or ignorant or 

389
00:20:39,220 --> 00:20:42,070
racist even worse or fill in the blank,
whatever it might be.

390
00:20:42,670 --> 00:20:45,100
And that created a huge blind spot,
I think.

391
00:20:45,650 --> 00:20:48,640
yeah.
Gigantic blind spot underestimating the,

392
00:20:49,270 --> 00:20:53,620
uh,
the flaws in polling methodology I think

393
00:20:53,621 --> 00:20:58,480
was also something that,
that from a rational perspective,

394
00:20:58,540 --> 00:21:00,040
if for instance,
I mean,

395
00:21:00,041 --> 00:21:05,041
I know my brothers is a effectively a 
phd.

396
00:21:05,471 --> 00:21:08,410
He's finishing his dissertation in,
in statistics.

397
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:10,150
He called trump months before it 
happened.

398
00:21:10,180 --> 00:21:11,013
Really?
He's,

399
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:12,430
oh yeah,
he's absolutely going to win.

400
00:21:12,610 --> 00:21:14,170
And uh,
he is not,

401
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:17,200
he would not position himself as a 
conservative in any,

402
00:21:17,230 --> 00:21:18,760
in any respect.
Uh,

403
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:21,130
Scott Adams,
creator of dilbert,

404
00:21:21,190 --> 00:21:26,170
also on my podcast called it kinda blow 
for blow how it was going to go down.

405
00:21:27,580 --> 00:21:28,540
Yeah.
And it's,

406
00:21:28,541 --> 00:21:29,590
um,
it's,

407
00:21:31,270 --> 00:21:32,650
I,
I do think that,

408
00:21:32,651 --> 00:21:36,130
just to get back to your question that 
there is a lot of group think in silicon

409
00:21:36,131 --> 00:21:36,964
valley and the,
the irony of that I think is Worth 

410
00:21:39,701 --> 00:21:40,534
underscoring because it's supposed to be
this think different place and yet it 

411
00:21:46,451 --> 00:21:47,284
has all of its own baggage and group 
think just like every other place that 

412
00:21:50,411 --> 00:21:53,890
has a mono conversation.
Uh,

413
00:21:53,891 --> 00:21:56,340
and then you have someone like peter 
teal a couple long enough.

414
00:21:56,380 --> 00:21:58,870
I've spent time with peter.
He's not a close friend,

415
00:21:58,871 --> 00:21:59,704
but I've had dinner at a,
been a group dinners with him a number 

416
00:22:03,371 --> 00:22:05,710
of times and he's a smart guy.

417
00:22:05,770 --> 00:22:06,603
So the first thing that I thought to 
myself when he came out in support of 

418
00:22:10,901 --> 00:22:14,620
trump wasn't how could he do this?
It was,

419
00:22:14,621 --> 00:22:16,720
what am I missing?
What am I missing?

420
00:22:16,780 --> 00:22:19,390
There's something I'm missing here.
What am I missing?

421
00:22:19,510 --> 00:22:24,510
Because teal is not need,
certainly in my experience,

422
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:28,540
very impulsive,
short term thinker.

423
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:30,310
That's just not,
that's just not him.

424
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:31,870
So,
uh,

425
00:22:31,871 --> 00:22:32,350
I,
I,

426
00:22:32,350 --> 00:22:34,180
from the very outset I was like,
what am I missing?

427
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:39,240
Like is there some tWenty year long bed 
or short bed that he's making right now?

428
00:22:41,111 --> 00:22:43,180
What,
what aspects of this am I missing?

429
00:22:43,230 --> 00:22:44,080
A.
But yes,

430
00:22:44,090 --> 00:22:46,780
I do think there's a lot of group 
thinking silicon valley,

431
00:22:47,170 --> 00:22:48,003
which is,
it just creates blind spots and opens 

432
00:22:51,101 --> 00:22:51,934
the door for then not only disruptive 
technology to say trying to cut out off 

433
00:22:56,860 --> 00:22:58,540
a yahoo or someone like that at the 
knees,

434
00:22:59,830 --> 00:23:02,260
but it creates,
I think,

435
00:23:02,261 --> 00:23:03,940
vulnerabilities in,
in a,

436
00:23:03,950 --> 00:23:05,800
in a political,
in a political landscape.

437
00:23:05,860 --> 00:23:07,720
And I'm far beyond that.

438
00:23:08,020 --> 00:23:08,853
Yeah.
I'm curious because you prefaced all of 

439
00:23:10,081 --> 00:23:10,914
that by saying that you don't want to 
talk about standing above your pay 

440
00:23:12,461 --> 00:23:13,294
grade,
which I think is an interesting way to 

441
00:23:13,811 --> 00:23:15,210
preface that.
You,

442
00:23:15,220 --> 00:23:16,053
you know,
you obviously are thought of as a 

443
00:23:17,111 --> 00:23:17,944
thought leader,
but politics has become so toxic that I 

444
00:23:21,131 --> 00:23:21,964
could sense you were choosing your words
very carefully there because you don't 

445
00:23:23,891 --> 00:23:24,724
want to upset anybody by slightly 
misspeaking or slightly misquoting 

446
00:23:28,631 --> 00:23:31,120
someone or something like that.
What do you make of the general tenor of

447
00:23:31,121 --> 00:23:32,680
dialogue in the country right now?

448
00:23:33,320 --> 00:23:35,450
I think it's ludicrous and self 
defeating.

449
00:23:35,540 --> 00:23:38,900
I think that everyone should reread 
fahrenheit 4:51

450
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:43,310
because if some people might recall 
reading it in high school and they think

451
00:23:43,311 --> 00:23:44,570
of this,
uh,

452
00:23:45,130 --> 00:23:45,963
did they tyrannical government that is 
forcing the burning of books and of 

453
00:23:51,561 --> 00:23:53,660
course the,
some of the main characters,

454
00:23:53,661 --> 00:23:55,880
but you have these firemen who are in 
charge of burning books.

455
00:23:56,630 --> 00:24:00,740
And what many people cease to realize if
they reread that book,

456
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:01,633
which they will rediscover,
is that it was actually the people in 

457
00:24:04,041 --> 00:24:08,390
the beginning who started the burning of
the books.

458
00:24:08,690 --> 00:24:12,710
Books that would offend any minority.
And I don't mean that in a racial group,

459
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:16,610
a racial sense,
but a minority population,

460
00:24:16,850 --> 00:24:18,500
uh,
began to be burned.

461
00:24:18,680 --> 00:24:20,540
And this is,
this is very,

462
00:24:20,541 --> 00:24:23,120
very,
very dangerous.

463
00:24:23,121 --> 00:24:26,330
And I think a very slippery slope where 
you have effectively,

464
00:24:26,540 --> 00:24:27,290
and uh,
I've,

465
00:24:27,290 --> 00:24:29,420
I've seen a number of people remark to 
this effect,

466
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:30,553
you have the majority of smart people 
who could discuss a topic and have the 

467
00:24:37,341 --> 00:24:38,174
necessary uncomfortable conversation and
a rational way opting out because the 

468
00:24:43,550 --> 00:24:44,383
personal downside is so high that it 
outweighs in the minds of these people 

469
00:24:49,431 --> 00:24:52,010
who could actually catalyze a lot of 
good.

470
00:24:52,250 --> 00:24:53,083
The,
the,

471
00:24:53,090 --> 00:24:53,923
the collective longterm good is not 
sufficiently compelling to take an 

472
00:24:58,581 --> 00:25:02,120
almost guaranteed short term or I should
say immediate,

473
00:25:02,121 --> 00:25:03,770
not short term.
It could be very longterm,

474
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:06,920
but immediate personal hit.
Uh,

475
00:25:06,921 --> 00:25:08,180
so I,
I think it's terrible.

476
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:09,560
I think it's at,
I think,

477
00:25:09,561 --> 00:25:10,910
I think it's the,
the biggest,

478
00:25:10,911 --> 00:25:14,390
the thing that scares me most of the 
United States right now is,

479
00:25:14,450 --> 00:25:19,450
is by far and away not what some leader 
from on high would necessarily do to us.

480
00:25:20,510 --> 00:25:22,400
It is what we were already doing to 
ourselves.

481
00:25:22,401 --> 00:25:23,234
And that is disinvited brilliant people 
from speaking at universities because 

482
00:25:27,621 --> 00:25:28,454
they might,
they might offer opinions or positions 

483
00:25:31,281 --> 00:25:35,060
that would make students uncomfortable.
That's the whole point.

484
00:25:35,770 --> 00:25:36,603
I mean,
how are you going to handle 

485
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:38,593
macroaggression in real life if you 
can't handle different opinions from 

486
00:25:41,961 --> 00:25:44,420
your own in an academic setting?
It's ludicrous.

487
00:25:44,421 --> 00:25:45,490
So that,
uh,

488
00:25:46,110 --> 00:25:46,700
yeah,
I get,

489
00:25:46,700 --> 00:25:48,890
I get pretty lit up about this because I
think it's,

490
00:25:48,950 --> 00:25:49,783
I think it's a very insidious problem 
that is in some ways being viewed as a 

491
00:25:53,991 --> 00:25:54,824
solution and it is certainly,
I think not a beneficial in the long 

492
00:26:00,500 --> 00:26:01,333
term at all.

493
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:02,193
Yeah,
you hit on a bunch of my wheel house 

494
00:26:03,161 --> 00:26:03,994
stuff there,
but I think the most interesting piece 

495
00:26:04,961 --> 00:26:05,794
of that is that what you're saying is 
basically good people who could really 

496
00:26:09,941 --> 00:26:12,190
change the world,
who could change people's minds,

497
00:26:12,191 --> 00:26:14,920
get involved,
that they're not because of the personal

498
00:26:14,921 --> 00:26:16,160
cost.
How would,

499
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:17,950
how can we unfurl that?
I mean,

500
00:26:17,951 --> 00:26:20,980
I've tried to bring on people here and,
and get to some of this,

501
00:26:21,220 --> 00:26:24,580
but I know and I can see it sometimes 
with guests and I'm sure you can too.

502
00:26:24,730 --> 00:26:29,050
You get to a place where they can't go 
any further.

503
00:26:29,051 --> 00:26:29,884
They just,
there's a cost of them talking about 

504
00:26:31,361 --> 00:26:33,550
something,
even if they're an expert in that,

505
00:26:33,551 --> 00:26:37,450
where they go,
now I'm veering past that red line and I

506
00:26:37,451 --> 00:26:39,880
can get into some trouble.
So how do we bring that back?

507
00:26:39,881 --> 00:26:40,714
For those of us that want to have 
responsible conversations and open 

508
00:26:43,801 --> 00:26:44,280
discourse?

509
00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:45,113
well,
there's,

510
00:26:45,140 --> 00:26:45,973
there's a word that I've been 
experimenting with a creating odd words 

511
00:26:49,951 --> 00:26:53,970
and inserting them into the common 
vernacular for two years.

512
00:26:53,971 --> 00:26:56,220
Now a one has made some rounds.
This is,

513
00:26:56,250 --> 00:26:59,280
this is one I did just for fun,
but you'll,

514
00:26:59,300 --> 00:27:01,130
you'll see where I'm going here.
So it's,

515
00:27:01,160 --> 00:27:01,993
it's dell adultery until adultery is 
when a significant other or you watch a 

516
00:27:07,051 --> 00:27:09,000
tv show that you've agreed to watch 
together.

517
00:27:09,001 --> 00:27:10,230
You watch it by yourself.
That's,

518
00:27:10,270 --> 00:27:11,640
that's tele daltrey.
So that.

519
00:27:11,670 --> 00:27:13,500
But that traveled.
Here's the important point.

520
00:27:13,501 --> 00:27:16,920
So that term traveled all over the place
and then we were.

521
00:27:16,921 --> 00:27:19,920
I was actually sitting in an airport 
overseas with my mom and she'd say,

522
00:27:19,950 --> 00:27:21,600
oh,
here's a funny word you would like.

523
00:27:21,601 --> 00:27:24,480
And it was in a magazine and it was tele
is tele adultery.

524
00:27:24,481 --> 00:27:28,710
This is where the I had created.
So there's a word that I currently,

525
00:27:28,711 --> 00:27:32,670
I think that it's very,
if you look at the,

526
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:34,193
the actors in this,
a suffocation of free speech or 

527
00:27:39,541 --> 00:27:42,930
discouragement at the very least have an
open discourse.

528
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:44,273
You have,
I think on many sides what some people 

529
00:27:47,611 --> 00:27:52,611
have called social justice warriors,
a who throw around terms like racist,

530
00:27:53,310 --> 00:27:56,520
sexist,
bigot of many different types,

531
00:27:56,820 --> 00:27:59,490
very loosely in those terms,
uh,

532
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:03,810
can have lasting damage even if there's 
no evidence associated with them.

533
00:28:03,980 --> 00:28:04,813
Uh,
so the accusation itself becomes the 

534
00:28:07,471 --> 00:28:08,304
conviction and the term social justice 
warriors not neutral in the sense that 

535
00:28:13,561 --> 00:28:14,394
it sounds positive.
So there really isn't any linguistic 

536
00:28:17,790 --> 00:28:18,623
punishment,
a equivalent to say racist that would 

537
00:28:22,801 --> 00:28:23,634
discourage someone from behaving in such
a haphazard fashion and in a way that 

538
00:28:27,751 --> 00:28:29,190
can destroy careers,
marriages,

539
00:28:29,191 --> 00:28:30,510
you name it.
Uh,

540
00:28:30,540 --> 00:28:34,860
so the term that I came up in a 
conversation with eric weinstein,

541
00:28:35,040 --> 00:28:37,440
really,
really brilliant mathematician,

542
00:28:37,441 --> 00:28:41,440
physicist,
was this term big,

543
00:28:41,441 --> 00:28:43,050
a tier that I thought of.
So big.

544
00:28:43,051 --> 00:28:47,370
A tier is clearly not a good thing.
It sounds terrible.

545
00:28:47,670 --> 00:28:48,503
And it is someone who calls others 
bigots for personal gain and that 

546
00:28:51,661 --> 00:28:53,490
personal gains,
you could just be attention,

547
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:56,340
it could be absolving themselves of 
guilt,

548
00:28:56,370 --> 00:28:57,203
it could be clickthroughs,
it could be yellow journalism and 

549
00:29:00,680 --> 00:29:04,260
irresponsible media just aiming for 
clickbait and click throughs.

550
00:29:04,560 --> 00:29:05,393
So I think that if big adhere were work 
to become a real term applied to people 

551
00:29:10,891 --> 00:29:15,891
who use these terms very loosely,
that it sounds silly,

552
00:29:17,011 --> 00:29:17,844
but I do think that words are what we 
lack right now are affective words and 

553
00:29:22,890 --> 00:29:26,260
labels to discourage this,
uh,

554
00:29:26,360 --> 00:29:27,193
this behavior.
So that's one that has come to mind is 

555
00:29:30,511 --> 00:29:34,080
big a tier,
I don't think until we have some type of

556
00:29:34,081 --> 00:29:34,914
disincentive from behaving in a way that
cauterizes or just stymies free speech 

557
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:45,033
that we're not going to get very far.
So if the humans just respond to 

558
00:29:46,721 --> 00:29:47,554
incentives,
I don't think humans are necessarily 

559
00:29:48,311 --> 00:29:49,144
bad.
We're just creatures that respond to 

560
00:29:52,541 --> 00:29:53,374
incentives.
So you have to figure out how to set 

561
00:29:55,151 --> 00:29:55,984
this,
the carrot or the stick sufficiently to 

562
00:29:57,491 --> 00:29:58,540
get the behavior you want.

563
00:29:58,660 --> 00:29:59,493
Yeah.
Are you saying it's almost like every 

564
00:30:00,821 --> 00:30:04,300
other animal on this earth?
That's exactly what I'm saying.

565
00:30:04,450 --> 00:30:06,880
Incredible.
well I love the phrase big here and I've

566
00:30:06,881 --> 00:30:07,990
used it a little bit,
but you know,

567
00:30:07,991 --> 00:30:10,000
we're going to try something as of 
today.

568
00:30:10,210 --> 00:30:12,970
I'm going to use a little bit of what 
they call the tim ferris effect,

569
00:30:12,971 --> 00:30:15,700
which is that when you know,
when you've had people on your show,

570
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:18,880
usually their book sales go up or their 
clicks go up or whatever it is.

571
00:30:19,090 --> 00:30:19,923
So we'll try a little something.
I'll push out big a tier from today 

572
00:30:22,211 --> 00:30:26,200
going forward and like fee if we get a 
little tim ferris effect on that because

573
00:30:26,201 --> 00:30:28,570
you're right,
you say social justice warrior,

574
00:30:28,740 --> 00:30:29,573
it sounds like a good thing for someone 
that doesn't know really the 

575
00:30:31,841 --> 00:30:33,910
underpinnings of what's of what's going 
on there.

576
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:35,430
Exactly.
Yeah.

577
00:30:35,650 --> 00:30:36,250
Let's,
let's,

578
00:30:36,250 --> 00:30:37,210
let's do it.
I'll love for it.

579
00:30:37,330 --> 00:30:38,163
Alright,
so let's shift a little bit to your 

580
00:30:39,101 --> 00:30:43,300
podcast because we are both creatures of
the interview.

581
00:30:43,390 --> 00:30:44,560
How am I doing so far,
by the way?

582
00:30:45,460 --> 00:30:46,840
You're doing great.
You're doing great.

583
00:30:47,230 --> 00:30:47,920
Okay.
Alright,

584
00:30:47,920 --> 00:30:48,753
very good.
So did you always think of yourself as 

585
00:30:50,651 --> 00:30:51,484
an interviewer?
What made you want to do the podcast in 

586
00:30:53,141 --> 00:30:53,974
that form?

587
00:30:54,710 --> 00:30:58,580
I always thought of myself as an 
experimenter and a teacher.

588
00:30:58,581 --> 00:30:59,414
I always thought I was going to teach 
ninth grade actually because I was very 

589
00:31:02,361 --> 00:31:06,890
much influenced by mentors at I think a 
very critical,

590
00:31:07,040 --> 00:31:09,570
critical juncture.
A around that age.

591
00:31:09,620 --> 00:31:12,440
The ninth,
10th grade kids make a lot of decisions.

592
00:31:12,441 --> 00:31:13,274
They don't realize you're going to take 
them down one promising path or down a 

593
00:31:16,581 --> 00:31:18,590
bad path,
but I digress.

594
00:31:18,591 --> 00:31:19,424
the point is that I view interviewing as
a tool in the toolkit for extracting 

595
00:31:25,430 --> 00:31:26,263
specific details and tactics that I can 
then impart to my readers who are I 

596
00:31:31,491 --> 00:31:36,200
guess my students in this case for 
replicating excellent results.

597
00:31:36,201 --> 00:31:36,961
That's it.
So I'm,

598
00:31:36,961 --> 00:31:39,440
I'm trying to tease oUt the cliff notes 
and interviewing,

599
00:31:39,441 --> 00:31:41,930
askIng good questions,
asking good follow up questions,

600
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:43,153
letting silence do the work at very 
specific points is how you extract that 

601
00:31:49,341 --> 00:31:52,910
gold and without the ability to 
interview.

602
00:31:52,910 --> 00:31:53,743
Well,
I can't do the research that I need to 

603
00:31:55,071 --> 00:31:58,550
do and the podcast.
I never expected to do anything.

604
00:31:58,570 --> 00:32:01,640
Uh,
it was really a commitment just to doing

605
00:32:01,670 --> 00:32:02,503
six episodes so that I wouldn't quit.
I made that public pronouncement do at 

606
00:32:06,951 --> 00:32:07,784
least six episodes so that I'd be held 
accountable and I want it to work on 

607
00:32:11,091 --> 00:32:11,924
improving verbal ticks.
I wanted to improve the selection and 

608
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:17,473
follow up related to questions and to 
become a more active listener because I 

609
00:32:21,201 --> 00:32:25,160
knew that even if the podcast cratered 
or I didn't like it and I quit,

610
00:32:25,550 --> 00:32:26,383
those were skills that would transfer 
everywhere else and this is something 

611
00:32:31,731 --> 00:32:32,564
that I actually borrowed a ultimately 
and really developed after Scott Adams 

612
00:32:37,490 --> 00:32:41,570
of dilbert fame and calls it systems 
thinking instead of goals thinkIng,

613
00:32:41,571 --> 00:32:42,404
but thinking of how you can win even if 
your project fails and the way you do 

614
00:32:45,951 --> 00:32:46,784
that is by focusing on developing skills
and relationships that transcend that 

615
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:52,273
and persist over time.
So that's really how I thought about it 

616
00:32:54,441 --> 00:32:57,170
and why I got into the audio game.
but I was burned out on books,

617
00:32:57,410 --> 00:32:59,210
on,
to take a break from big books.

618
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:00,433
And here we are.

619
00:33:00,500 --> 00:33:01,910
Yeah,
I hear that.

620
00:33:01,911 --> 00:33:04,390
I'm curious on the,
on the followup question.

621
00:33:04,420 --> 00:33:07,730
I got a follow up for you,
which is how,

622
00:33:07,790 --> 00:33:11,810
how scientific is that for you?
So if you have a follow up prepared,

623
00:33:11,811 --> 00:33:14,810
someone hands you the answer that 
basically you expected,

624
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:19,550
do you always go to that follow up or 
how willing are you to go out there?

625
00:33:19,551 --> 00:33:20,384
Because I find that to be a constant 
battle sort of of me wanting to just 

626
00:33:24,081 --> 00:33:24,914
have the natural flow of a conversation 
versus I also want to hit on certain 

627
00:33:28,221 --> 00:33:29,840
things.
I don't want to let theM off the hook on

628
00:33:29,841 --> 00:33:32,660
certain things.
I let people hang themselves.

629
00:33:32,661 --> 00:33:34,700
That's my method instead of shouting 
them down.

630
00:33:34,850 --> 00:33:36,950
I think that's a little more of your 
method as well,

631
00:33:37,520 --> 00:33:38,840
which is what I'm doing with you right 
now.

632
00:33:38,841 --> 00:33:39,674
very subtly.

633
00:33:39,960 --> 00:33:40,561
Oh yeah.
No,

634
00:33:40,561 --> 00:33:44,940
I feel like like an invisible midget is 
strangling me at the moment on my back,

635
00:33:45,450 --> 00:33:46,710
her naked choking me,
but no,

636
00:33:46,711 --> 00:33:47,550
the.
The,

637
00:33:47,940 --> 00:33:52,000
the question I think has very personal 
answers in,

638
00:33:52,020 --> 00:33:52,853
and the reason I say that is if you 
study some of the people best known for 

639
00:33:55,891 --> 00:33:57,510
asking questions,
say Larry King.

640
00:33:57,820 --> 00:34:02,490
Larry king very often goes in doing next
to no homework on his guests.

641
00:34:02,910 --> 00:34:06,060
The rationale being that the guest has 
no familiarity,

642
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:08,550
I'm sorry,
the audience has no familiarity with the

643
00:34:08,551 --> 00:34:13,440
guest and he wants to start from where 
they are and asking the basic questions.

644
00:34:13,890 --> 00:34:14,723
Then you have,
say a james lipton of inside the actors 

645
00:34:17,791 --> 00:34:18,624
studio.
he has every question scripted in 

646
00:34:20,521 --> 00:34:23,790
advance and he never deviates from his 
order of questions.

647
00:34:24,120 --> 00:34:25,350
Period.
End of story.

648
00:34:25,351 --> 00:34:29,430
He knows the answer in some form to 
every question he's going to ask,

649
00:34:29,820 --> 00:34:32,160
so you have them on opposite ends of the
spectrum.

650
00:34:32,160 --> 00:34:32,993
In my case,
I don't necessarily have set followup 

651
00:34:35,640 --> 00:34:36,473
questions,
but I do have a handful of questions 

652
00:34:38,311 --> 00:34:39,144
which I've borrowed from other people 
that very often can turn a mediocre 

653
00:34:44,371 --> 00:34:45,204
answer or a decent answer into a great 
answer with a few extra details and 

654
00:34:49,231 --> 00:34:50,064
layers.
So you might have somebody ask them a 

655
00:34:51,421 --> 00:34:53,190
question,
they respond and then you say,

656
00:34:53,610 --> 00:34:57,330
what did you learn from that super easy 
follow up question?

657
00:34:57,331 --> 00:34:59,170
You can ask almost any time,
right?

658
00:34:59,610 --> 00:35:03,390
How did that make you feel?
That's another really easy one.

659
00:35:03,540 --> 00:35:07,840
That is kind of a layup oftentimes and 
uh,

660
00:35:08,070 --> 00:35:11,520
I don't go in with a completely set 
agenda.

661
00:35:11,521 --> 00:35:13,590
I'll give you an example.
When I was interviewing margaret cho,

662
00:35:13,591 --> 00:35:15,730
comedian,
I thought we were going to talk about.

663
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:18,400
We've got her next week,
so this is going to be good for me.

664
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:19,231
Oh,
she's awesome.

665
00:35:19,231 --> 00:35:20,160
She's awesome.
She's great.

666
00:35:20,161 --> 00:35:20,994
So,
so we were talking about the craft of 

667
00:35:22,351 --> 00:35:25,920
comedy and so on and handling hecklers 
and so on.

668
00:35:25,921 --> 00:35:30,870
You should ask her about that and we,
but we ended up bringing up and touching

669
00:35:30,871 --> 00:35:35,660
on addiction in comedy,
drug addiction specifically in that,

670
00:35:35,790 --> 00:35:36,623
that took us to a really place and if I 
had been stuck on script we wouldn't 

671
00:35:40,141 --> 00:35:40,974
have explored it and that ended up being
just an incredibly fertile ground for 

672
00:35:44,101 --> 00:35:47,640
discussion.
So I try not to Be too fixed,

673
00:35:47,740 --> 00:35:48,573
uh,
but I do have my pet questions that I 

674
00:35:50,221 --> 00:35:51,570
like to ask as we all do.

675
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:54,740
Yeah.
Have you ever been offended by a guess?

676
00:35:54,770 --> 00:35:56,840
That's one of the things that people ask
me a lot,

677
00:35:56,841 --> 00:35:57,674
that how can I sit with someone who 
maybe is against gay marriage and I'm 

678
00:36:00,890 --> 00:36:01,723
gay man,
how can I sit with them and even if I 

679
00:36:03,531 --> 00:36:07,430
hear their rationale and their not being
mean to me specifically,

680
00:36:07,431 --> 00:36:11,030
how can I tolerate that conversation?
And to me it's like I may not like it,

681
00:36:11,031 --> 00:36:11,864
but I do have to.
The whole point of an interview is to 

682
00:36:13,461 --> 00:36:14,294
try to understand why someone thinks 
that someone ever said something they 

683
00:36:15,981 --> 00:36:17,660
truly offended you.

684
00:36:18,470 --> 00:36:21,740
I'm sure they have.
Nothing's jumping to mind.

685
00:36:22,080 --> 00:36:26,450
Uh,
but I'm sure that that's the case and it

686
00:36:26,451 --> 00:36:29,810
makes me think a bit of advice that I 
got from stephen dubner,

687
00:36:30,290 --> 00:36:31,123
author of freakonomics or coauthor,
at least he collaborates with steven 

688
00:36:33,381 --> 00:36:35,250
levin in this,
uh,

689
00:36:35,460 --> 00:36:36,293
the.
I kind of went into a few different 

690
00:36:37,251 --> 00:36:38,084
aspects of this in tools of titans,
but he said it's very important to put 

691
00:36:40,491 --> 00:36:43,730
away your moral compass in the beginning
when you're trying to problem solve.

692
00:36:43,820 --> 00:36:45,830
Especially when you're collaborating 
with other people.

693
00:36:45,831 --> 00:36:46,664
It doesn't mean that you absolve 
yourself of moral decisions and 

694
00:36:50,601 --> 00:36:52,130
judgments.
But Initially,

695
00:36:53,060 --> 00:36:55,670
if you,
if you want to put,

696
00:36:55,730 --> 00:36:59,390
if you want to generate as many possible
solutions,

697
00:36:59,750 --> 00:37:04,750
including non obvious solutions or 
lateral thinking solutions that you want

698
00:37:04,851 --> 00:37:05,684
to take the constraints and assumptions 
that you live with all day long and try 

699
00:37:08,991 --> 00:37:10,010
to set them to the side.

700
00:37:10,760 --> 00:37:12,590
When I'm interviewing someone,
uh,

701
00:37:12,620 --> 00:37:14,900
let's say,
could be Glenn Beck,

702
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:16,220
right?
I live in san francisco.

703
00:37:16,500 --> 00:37:18,110
Uh,
if I'm interviewing Glenn Beck,

704
00:37:18,260 --> 00:37:21,080
if I'm interviewing a,
well,

705
00:37:21,081 --> 00:37:24,740
let's just say general stanley 
mcchrystal or jocko willink.

706
00:37:24,950 --> 00:37:25,783
So both from a extensive military 
backgrounds versus someone who might 

707
00:37:29,421 --> 00:37:30,254
view themselves as a extremely,
let's say hyper progressive slash 

708
00:37:37,221 --> 00:37:38,054
liberal pacifist while they're going to 
have opposing viewpoints on a lot of 

709
00:37:41,991 --> 00:37:42,824
things.
But what,

710
00:37:42,830 --> 00:37:43,663
what my ivy job as extracting 
politically neutral a or a political 

711
00:37:51,860 --> 00:37:54,650
routines and habits and so on that 
people can use.

712
00:37:54,651 --> 00:37:55,484
So one of the mistakes I think that we 
as humans tend to make is that we throw 

713
00:38:00,171 --> 00:38:01,940
the baby out with the bathwater.
We say,

714
00:38:01,941 --> 00:38:03,950
well,
I disagree with so and so on x.

715
00:38:04,370 --> 00:38:08,630
So I'm going to.
I'm going to assume they have nothing to

716
00:38:08,631 --> 00:38:09,464
offer me.
and that's a huge mistake and it's a 

717
00:38:11,711 --> 00:38:12,760
very costly mistakes.

718
00:38:12,760 --> 00:38:13,593
So whenever I'm talking to someone,
I have some of my friends I disagree 

719
00:38:16,791 --> 00:38:17,624
with,
vehemently about let's say nine out of 

720
00:38:21,171 --> 00:38:24,650
10 of their core beliefs,
let's just call them political beliefs,

721
00:38:25,700 --> 00:38:26,533
but as long as they will engage in a 
debate and not try to shut it down with 

722
00:38:30,711 --> 00:38:32,660
name calling and nonsense,
if,

723
00:38:32,740 --> 00:38:36,580
if they're willing to dance with that 
and spar and admit when they've.

724
00:38:37,120 --> 00:38:37,953
If they are able to absorb new 
information and consider new evidence 

725
00:38:43,270 --> 00:38:48,270
and change their viewpoints accordingly.
In some cases I have no problem spending

726
00:38:48,401 --> 00:38:49,234
time with those people and in in fact,
I think one of the biggest mistakes we 

727
00:38:52,421 --> 00:38:54,870
were talking about echo chambers and 
silicon valley's,

728
00:38:54,910 --> 00:38:55,743
that if you surround yourself with 
people who hold all the same opinions 

729
00:38:58,511 --> 00:38:59,344
that you do well,
you're going to get very comfortable 

730
00:39:02,411 --> 00:39:03,244
with comfort.
But it's not going to force you to 

731
00:39:06,940 --> 00:39:08,140
consider,
say,

732
00:39:08,141 --> 00:39:11,050
devil's advocate positions that are 
diametrically opposed to your own.

733
00:39:11,140 --> 00:39:13,900
And I think that's incredibly valuable 
practice.

734
00:39:13,901 --> 00:39:17,230
And some of my friends are the first 
people to call bs.

735
00:39:18,100 --> 00:39:19,620
Even in a group setting.
At a dinner like,

736
00:39:19,750 --> 00:39:22,330
like novel robuchon I love the guy,
uh,

737
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:25,750
and I feel better.
I feel every conversation we have,

738
00:39:25,751 --> 00:39:28,090
I come out of having improved in some 
way.

739
00:39:28,300 --> 00:39:33,300
You'll be the first person to call me 
out if I throw out some position or,

740
00:39:33,430 --> 00:39:38,260
or strong stance without evidence and 
rationale to back it up.

741
00:39:38,370 --> 00:39:39,203
Yeah.
So,

742
00:39:39,420 --> 00:39:41,040
and don't you relish in that?
I mean,

743
00:39:41,041 --> 00:39:42,420
I think I love it.
I love it.

744
00:39:42,510 --> 00:39:43,343
I think most people truly do and somehow
we've sort of been tricked or dumbed 

745
00:39:48,001 --> 00:39:48,834
down to the point where we think if 
anything goes a little against us that 

746
00:39:53,011 --> 00:39:55,190
we have to lash out.
And that's so not,

747
00:39:55,230 --> 00:39:57,960
that's so not fertile ground for,
for growth.

748
00:39:58,680 --> 00:39:59,161
No,
I agree.

749
00:39:59,161 --> 00:39:59,551
Yeah.
I mean,

750
00:39:59,551 --> 00:40:04,551
I think that one of the things I try to 
do a at least once a week,

751
00:40:04,650 --> 00:40:05,483
but preferably much more than this is to
be the weakest person in the room at 

752
00:40:08,911 --> 00:40:09,744
something where I want to be in the room
and it's going to lead me probably to 

753
00:40:13,321 --> 00:40:17,760
feel insecure,
maybe insufficient,

754
00:40:18,300 --> 00:40:19,133
but whether it's training in a sport or 
picking up a new skill or sitting down 

755
00:40:25,141 --> 00:40:25,974
in a room where people are discussing 
could be anything molecular biology or 

756
00:40:30,780 --> 00:40:31,613
politics where I feel like I'm in over 
my head and that is how you average up 

757
00:40:38,970 --> 00:40:42,600
and I think you also average up by 
surrounding yourself with people who can

758
00:40:42,601 --> 00:40:47,601
intelligently debate and not just use 
rhetoric to try to corner people,

759
00:40:48,360 --> 00:40:49,193
but to actually go toe to toe with 
logical arguments at least based on 

760
00:40:52,891 --> 00:40:54,330
their own assumptions.
I think that's.

761
00:40:54,390 --> 00:40:55,223
If you want to become smarter and by the
way like the race doesn't go to the 

762
00:41:00,110 --> 00:41:02,640
well.
The fittest in this situation means most

763
00:41:02,641 --> 00:41:07,641
adaptable and I think that is the 
cornerstone of everything else.

764
00:41:08,640 --> 00:41:09,473
Yeah.
What do you make of this new idea that 

765
00:41:10,621 --> 00:41:15,090
everyone seems to think that they have 
to have an opinion on everything?

766
00:41:15,120 --> 00:41:19,170
Like if you look at Russia right now,
whatever is going on with Russia and the

767
00:41:19,171 --> 00:41:21,060
election,
we don't have to get into the minutia of

768
00:41:21,061 --> 00:41:21,894
it,
but it seems to me that people who I've 

769
00:41:23,041 --> 00:41:23,874
never seen talk about Russia before,
who I don't think are particularly 

770
00:41:26,611 --> 00:41:27,444
informed or smart.
Everybody's got an opinion and must 

771
00:41:30,420 --> 00:41:32,910
share that opinion.
I'm for the free speech part.

772
00:41:32,911 --> 00:41:33,744
They do whatever they want,
but just this idea that everyone always 

773
00:41:36,110 --> 00:41:38,330
has to share everything.

774
00:41:39,360 --> 00:41:40,010
Yeah.
I mean they.

775
00:41:40,010 --> 00:41:41,970
They probably couldn't place rush on a 
map.

776
00:41:42,320 --> 00:41:43,280
Yeah,
so the,

777
00:41:43,290 --> 00:41:44,700
the,
the,

778
00:41:44,870 --> 00:41:48,720
the,
the great gift and curse of the internet

779
00:41:49,380 --> 00:41:52,930
is that everyone has a voice now that 
means every smart people,

780
00:41:53,580 --> 00:41:54,413
every smart person as voice also means 
every idiot has a voice and a more and 

781
00:42:00,841 --> 00:42:01,674
more,
and this is in part because I go out of 

782
00:42:04,141 --> 00:42:06,780
my way to expose myself to people who 
knew more about many,

783
00:42:06,781 --> 00:42:09,870
many domains than myself.
I find myself.

784
00:42:09,871 --> 00:42:11,430
It's not pleading the fifth.
It's different.

785
00:42:11,431 --> 00:42:12,264
I will say,
I don't think I'm qualified to have an 

786
00:42:14,101 --> 00:42:17,040
opinion on this.
I say that in the last few years,

787
00:42:17,070 --> 00:42:20,340
my,
the frequency of me saying that has just

788
00:42:20,420 --> 00:42:21,780
skyrocketed,
uh,

789
00:42:21,960 --> 00:42:25,920
because I don't want to have a strong 
opinion where I can't back it up.

790
00:42:26,730 --> 00:42:31,730
And so I think that it's fine to have an
informed opinion,

791
00:42:34,260 --> 00:42:39,260
but there's informed confidence and then
there's uninformed cubistic stupidity.

792
00:42:39,931 --> 00:42:40,880
Um,
so I,

793
00:42:40,910 --> 00:42:44,190
I try,
I would hope that people would lean more

794
00:42:44,191 --> 00:42:46,110
towards the farmer and away from the 
ladder,

795
00:42:46,111 --> 00:42:48,120
but alas,
in,

796
00:42:48,270 --> 00:42:49,103
in a,
in a media culture where the eyeballs 

797
00:42:53,521 --> 00:42:58,521
and ears tend to gravitate to the most 
outlandish argument imaginable.

798
00:42:59,910 --> 00:43:03,750
Uh,
it seems that that tends to get a lot of

799
00:43:03,751 --> 00:43:04,470
the attention.

800
00:43:04,470 --> 00:43:07,230
Yeah.
Are you ever tempted by that,

801
00:43:07,231 --> 00:43:09,240
that click portion of this,
you know,

802
00:43:09,241 --> 00:43:10,074
we know very easily we could title are 
things differently and probably triple 

803
00:43:13,081 --> 00:43:15,670
the clicks.
We could use mismeeting thumbnails.

804
00:43:15,680 --> 00:43:17,820
I mean know all the games of the digital
world.

805
00:43:18,300 --> 00:43:19,133
Plenty of people are playing.
Have you ever been tempted to do any of 

806
00:43:21,241 --> 00:43:22,074
that stuff?

807
00:43:22,670 --> 00:43:23,490
You know,
I,

808
00:43:23,490 --> 00:43:25,310
I,
in the beginning,

809
00:43:25,920 --> 00:43:26,753
in the beginning,
I mean when I had my first blog and if 

810
00:43:28,701 --> 00:43:31,070
people out there want to laugh their 
asses off,

811
00:43:31,071 --> 00:43:34,460
they can look up just google tim ferriss
first blog.

812
00:43:34,461 --> 00:43:35,294
It is the most hideous disorganized,
terrible mess you've ever seen on the 

813
00:43:40,071 --> 00:43:40,720
internet.
It's,

814
00:43:40,720 --> 00:43:41,553
it's really atrocious.
And at the time I was told I had to 

815
00:43:45,231 --> 00:43:46,064
mimic this person and how they did x.
I had to do 12 posts a day before noon 

816
00:43:51,261 --> 00:43:54,290
to have any hope of ab and c it was 
there,

817
00:43:54,291 --> 00:43:58,670
all these arbitrary rules and it was a 
me too game of mimicry.

818
00:43:58,671 --> 00:44:03,671
So I did try listicles and all sorts of 
stuff that on some level works,

819
00:44:05,330 --> 00:44:10,130
but it wasn't me and it had no evergreen
value.

820
00:44:10,880 --> 00:44:14,570
So I've,
I've been rewarded thankfully for trying

821
00:44:14,571 --> 00:44:15,404
to put together a really comprehensive 
material that lasts not only last 

822
00:44:21,920 --> 00:44:22,731
multiple years,
but the real estate,

823
00:44:22,731 --> 00:44:26,300
if we're talking about print,
let's say actually goes up over time.

824
00:44:26,510 --> 00:44:27,590
So my,
my,

825
00:44:27,650 --> 00:44:28,483
my google real estate appreciates over 
time and some of my most popular posts 

826
00:44:33,391 --> 00:44:34,224
were written five,
six years ago and they still drive the 

827
00:44:36,031 --> 00:44:36,864
majority of traffic to my blog.
So I have been tempted at points to do 

828
00:44:40,531 --> 00:44:43,020
that.
But ultimately my fans,

829
00:44:43,400 --> 00:44:44,670
oh,
I'm very fortunate,

830
00:44:44,760 --> 00:44:47,460
very smart,
generally very well educated.

831
00:44:47,780 --> 00:44:48,613
They are very vocal.
So if I try to pull any of those 

832
00:44:50,611 --> 00:44:54,600
shenanigans,
I get punished very quickly for that.

833
00:44:54,601 --> 00:44:57,030
So it's um,
it's good to be held accountable.

834
00:44:57,380 --> 00:44:57,931
Yeah,
I,

835
00:44:57,931 --> 00:45:00,170
I feel the same way.
So we're uh,

836
00:45:00,230 --> 00:45:01,700
we're in good company.
I suppose.

837
00:45:02,120 --> 00:45:02,953
What about just sort of the general 
feeling right now that the media 

838
00:45:06,441 --> 00:45:07,274
companies,
twitter and youtube and google that 

839
00:45:09,801 --> 00:45:10,634
there is some sort of censorshIp 
happening related to either algorithms 

840
00:45:15,050 --> 00:45:15,883
or you know,
banning certain people like twitter for 

841
00:45:18,171 --> 00:45:20,660
example,
they banned milo.

842
00:45:21,020 --> 00:45:21,831
Uh,
but you know,

843
00:45:21,831 --> 00:45:22,850
they'll have,
you know,

844
00:45:22,851 --> 00:45:26,000
the richard spencers on there and 
verified.

845
00:45:26,450 --> 00:45:27,283
Again,
you don't have to comment on the 

846
00:45:27,411 --> 00:45:29,060
specifics of that,
but just the general,

847
00:45:29,061 --> 00:45:32,840
like these companies are so close to 
government right now.

848
00:45:32,930 --> 00:45:35,960
and this is our information highway 
right here.

849
00:45:38,430 --> 00:45:43,050
This is a toughie.
This is where I might use that line that

850
00:45:43,051 --> 00:45:43,720
I mentioned.
Yeah.

851
00:45:43,720 --> 00:45:44,940
Yeah,
I see.

852
00:45:44,941 --> 00:45:46,430
He set me up with it.

853
00:45:46,880 --> 00:45:47,713
Yeah.
But it's not because I couldn't have an 

854
00:45:49,911 --> 00:45:52,230
opinion,
but I feel like I,

855
00:45:52,370 --> 00:45:53,203
I would have an obligation to actually 
sit down with people who work at 

856
00:45:56,391 --> 00:45:57,224
facebook,
twitter and these places because I know 

857
00:45:58,911 --> 00:45:59,744
a lot of people in all of these 
companies and have a real factual 

858
00:46:01,941 --> 00:46:04,020
discussion about what's going on.
Um,

859
00:46:04,130 --> 00:46:06,590
at this point,
I do think at the very least,

860
00:46:06,591 --> 00:46:07,424
if we're going to deal with bending or 
preventing certain types of people from 

861
00:46:10,970 --> 00:46:11,803
voicing their opinions,
there should be a consIstent playing 

862
00:46:14,421 --> 00:46:15,560
field,
right?

863
00:46:15,561 --> 00:46:16,394
It shouldn't be moving goalposts and so 
the rules should be clear from the 

864
00:46:19,371 --> 00:46:20,204
outset and they should apply to everyone
and there shouldn't be one off 

865
00:46:24,111 --> 00:46:25,630
exceptions.
Uh,

866
00:46:25,631 --> 00:46:30,631
I think in most cases when we get into 
algorithms and what is rewarded and what

867
00:46:33,711 --> 00:46:36,860
is not,
there are always unintended consequences

868
00:46:37,790 --> 00:46:41,630
of a,
the best design.

869
00:46:41,660 --> 00:46:45,740
Whether that is an algorithm or if 
there's an incentive structure,

870
00:46:45,770 --> 00:46:45,950
right?

871
00:46:45,950 --> 00:46:48,380
I mean,
if you incentivize any of your workers,

872
00:46:48,860 --> 00:46:49,693
let's say within an organization with 
certain types of sales quotas and 

873
00:46:52,101 --> 00:46:52,934
bonuses and so on,
there are always going to be sort of 

874
00:46:55,640 --> 00:46:58,940
perverse side effects of those 
incentives.

875
00:46:58,941 --> 00:47:01,730
That's always the case.
So I think that it's,

876
00:47:02,030 --> 00:47:02,863
in a way,
it's,

877
00:47:02,890 --> 00:47:07,760
it's on one hand,
rational and important that we have high

878
00:47:07,761 --> 00:47:10,010
standards for how people,
uh,

879
00:47:10,400 --> 00:47:11,233
how people serve and curate data so that
we're not proliferating fake news and 

880
00:47:16,431 --> 00:47:17,264
that,
that can't be used as a weapon of 

881
00:47:17,981 --> 00:47:21,890
propaganda in a very damaging capacity 
simultaneously.

882
00:47:21,891 --> 00:47:22,724
I think it's unreasonable to expect that
all of these gigantic companies we're 

883
00:47:26,270 --> 00:47:27,103
dealing with technology and platforms 
have a that is incomprehensible to most 

884
00:47:32,261 --> 00:47:33,094
people who aren't sitting down and being
shown what it looks like on some level 

885
00:47:36,521 --> 00:47:38,260
by say,
an employee of google.

886
00:47:38,261 --> 00:47:39,094
It's,
it's hard to even fathom what being 

887
00:47:40,811 --> 00:47:44,530
google means.
So it's unfair to expect them to get all

888
00:47:44,531 --> 00:47:46,690
the details right all the time.
It's an evolving system,

889
00:47:46,691 --> 00:47:48,040
so they're,
they're gonna make mistakes,

890
00:47:48,470 --> 00:47:49,303
uh,
and it's good to hold them to a high 

891
00:47:51,791 --> 00:47:56,791
standard but difficult to expect 
perfection as they try to improve it.

892
00:47:58,360 --> 00:47:59,193
Um,
so,

893
00:47:59,330 --> 00:48:01,190
so that I would,
uh,

894
00:48:01,240 --> 00:48:02,073
I would put safely in the category of,
I'm going to reserve judgment until I 

895
00:48:04,451 --> 00:48:05,350
have more information.

896
00:48:05,490 --> 00:48:08,310
I think that was a pretty solid answer 
for reserving judgment.

897
00:48:08,311 --> 00:48:10,380
I mean,
you still gave me something there.

898
00:48:10,950 --> 00:48:15,150
How do you decide who to trust when you,
when you're getting your information,

899
00:48:15,151 --> 00:48:17,250
you're talking to people from,
I mean,

900
00:48:17,251 --> 00:48:18,084
in your case,
quite literally every walk of life 

901
00:48:19,321 --> 00:48:20,154
probably that there is.
How do you decide who or what or what 

902
00:48:23,641 --> 00:48:27,270
news organization or whatever else that 
you actually feel is doing a fair,

903
00:48:27,271 --> 00:48:28,104
impartial job?

904
00:48:29,620 --> 00:48:32,410
Uh,
I don't trust organizations in general,

905
00:48:32,440 --> 00:48:33,273
um,
but I will try to identify specific 

906
00:48:35,351 --> 00:48:39,130
people and if I'm really trying to do 
triage,

907
00:48:40,600 --> 00:48:45,600
I will identify people in my circle of 
friends are in my network who may not be

908
00:48:49,751 --> 00:48:52,570
specialists in the domain that I'm 
looking at,

909
00:48:52,600 --> 00:48:55,270
whether that's a cancer research or

910
00:48:56,690 --> 00:49:00,020
fill in the blank,
a san francisco local politics.

911
00:49:00,110 --> 00:49:00,943
And,
and how to most effect change with a 

912
00:49:02,481 --> 00:49:04,610
given proposition.
It could be super specific.

913
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:05,833
I will reach out to two or three of my 
friends who I think will have already 

914
00:49:08,361 --> 00:49:13,361
tried to vet a good sources of 
information or simply good thinking.

915
00:49:15,410 --> 00:49:18,110
So it could be people who are good at 
interpreting the information.

916
00:49:18,650 --> 00:49:23,180
People were acting as,
as human aggregators and filters.

917
00:49:24,020 --> 00:49:24,853
Oh,
almost go out immediately to those 

918
00:49:26,211 --> 00:49:27,050
people.
For instance.

919
00:49:27,390 --> 00:49:32,210
Uh,
I very frequently bump into people.

920
00:49:32,500 --> 00:49:34,790
I'm excited.
I'm reasonably involved with,

921
00:49:35,090 --> 00:49:37,280
uh,
both current and former military.

922
00:49:37,281 --> 00:49:38,114
So I've,
I've spent time at the defense language 

923
00:49:39,861 --> 00:49:42,890
institute in monterey,
certainly have a lot of friends who were

924
00:49:42,891 --> 00:49:43,724
former military and you bump into a lot 
of folks running around calling 

925
00:49:49,881 --> 00:49:54,170
themselves navy seals and a lot of them 
are

926
00:49:55,860 --> 00:49:58,860
exaggerating what they've done.
There are some very,

927
00:49:58,861 --> 00:49:59,694
very legitimate folks.
And then there are a lot of people who 

928
00:50:01,561 --> 00:50:05,550
drive the legitimate folks crazy because
all they actually did was passed buds,

929
00:50:05,790 --> 00:50:06,623
were never deployed.
Now they're running around selling navy 

930
00:50:08,971 --> 00:50:11,160
seal workout routines and getting book 
deals.

931
00:50:11,450 --> 00:50:13,290
Right?
So if in a case like that,

932
00:50:13,291 --> 00:50:14,124
I will immediately go to two or three of
my friends were from that community and 

933
00:50:15,901 --> 00:50:16,291
say,
hey,

934
00:50:16,291 --> 00:50:17,124
sniff test zero to 10,
how would you recommend I talk to this 

935
00:50:19,351 --> 00:50:23,250
person?
So it's a very hands on process.

936
00:50:23,550 --> 00:50:26,990
I start from effectively a place of 
distrust with,

937
00:50:27,260 --> 00:50:32,260
with any mass media because the 
incentives are not aligned with truth at

938
00:50:36,261 --> 00:50:38,510
all costs.
They just are not.

939
00:50:38,720 --> 00:50:40,460
And,
and unfortunately,

940
00:50:40,461 --> 00:50:41,294
that's,
I think the reality of the business 

941
00:50:43,011 --> 00:50:44,990
models of,
of many of these,

942
00:50:45,130 --> 00:50:46,130
uh,
companies.

943
00:50:46,131 --> 00:50:46,964
So even the individual participants,
however much they may want to represent 

944
00:50:51,981 --> 00:50:52,814
difficult or to divulge and discuss 
difficult truths are disincentivized 

945
00:50:57,231 --> 00:50:58,064
from doing so because it may be so 
nuanced that only five percent of the 

946
00:51:01,941 --> 00:51:05,450
target audience will take the time to 
understand it and discuss it.

947
00:51:05,810 --> 00:51:08,840
But when you're trying to monetize on a 
cpm basis,

948
00:51:09,350 --> 00:51:14,280
the number of slideshows you can put on 
a website then a,

949
00:51:14,450 --> 00:51:17,750
you run into,
you run into a conflict very quickly.

950
00:51:17,880 --> 00:51:19,340
Uh,
yeah.

951
00:51:19,400 --> 00:51:21,560
So that's unfortunate challenge of,
of,

952
00:51:21,620 --> 00:51:22,281
of,
of,

953
00:51:22,281 --> 00:51:24,530
uh,
trying to siphon news.

954
00:51:24,531 --> 00:51:26,780
Another thing that I'll use,
and I've no affiliation with this,

955
00:51:26,781 --> 00:51:27,614
this is a program called nuzzel and use 
these eel and what that will do is it 

956
00:51:32,031 --> 00:51:32,864
will aggregate the most shared stories 
from the people I follow on twitter and 

957
00:51:39,801 --> 00:51:40,634
it creates a digest of say the top 10 
stories that have been shared the most 

958
00:51:44,571 --> 00:51:49,571
by the people I have already selected to
follow and I've found that very useful,

959
00:51:50,451 --> 00:51:51,284
but it in at any point,
for instance right now or near 

960
00:51:55,640 --> 00:51:59,120
presidential elections really within six
months on either side,

961
00:51:59,510 --> 00:52:04,510
it's just 99 percent noise,
but at other periods it can be a very,

962
00:52:07,011 --> 00:52:07,844
very useful source of pre-filtered 
information from folks I've already 

963
00:52:12,681 --> 00:52:16,910
handpicked to follow on say twitter.
So for pattern matching,

964
00:52:17,010 --> 00:52:17,870
uh,
that's been,

965
00:52:17,900 --> 00:52:19,010
that's been very helpful for me.

966
00:52:19,170 --> 00:52:20,003
Yeah,
it's funny because I expected and hoped 

967
00:52:22,321 --> 00:52:23,154
that after the election we'd have like a
little bit of a low with politics one 

968
00:52:26,311 --> 00:52:27,144
way or another and it's almost like 
everything has just been ramped up even 

969
00:52:30,361 --> 00:52:32,220
more.
I'm curious when you talk about,

970
00:52:32,221 --> 00:52:33,054
you know,
picking some people that you trust and 

971
00:52:33,841 --> 00:52:35,100
things like that,
uh,

972
00:52:35,101 --> 00:52:35,934
you are also from long island and I've 
mentioned on the show a couple of times 

973
00:52:38,971 --> 00:52:43,140
before that one of my great joys over 
the course of the election is that I was

974
00:52:43,141 --> 00:52:43,974
involved in a group text with three of 
my old childhood from middle school 

975
00:52:47,251 --> 00:52:50,730
friends and we sort of reconnected over 
politics arguing all the time.

976
00:52:50,731 --> 00:52:53,820
One of the guys was a huge trump guy.
One was a huge bernie guy.

977
00:52:53,821 --> 00:52:57,900
One was somewhere in between and then me
and I thought this,

978
00:52:57,970 --> 00:53:00,780
these are people I trust.
Like I knew them from childhood.

979
00:53:00,781 --> 00:53:03,420
I know where they come from.
I knew theIr family,

980
00:53:03,421 --> 00:53:05,580
celebrated holidays with them,
all of that stuff.

981
00:53:05,790 --> 00:53:08,100
Do you do have a couple of people in 
your life like that

982
00:53:09,830 --> 00:53:12,530
who I have completely diverging 
opinions?

983
00:53:12,640 --> 00:53:13,660
Well,
diverging opinions,

984
00:53:13,661 --> 00:53:16,780
but also that you have,
you have the long history from childhood

985
00:53:16,781 --> 00:53:17,614
that you,
that maybe are outside of what you do 

986
00:53:19,001 --> 00:53:21,680
normally that you can go to and be like,
oh yeah,

987
00:53:21,690 --> 00:53:23,410
what do you think about stuff?
You know?

988
00:53:23,520 --> 00:53:24,353
Oh,
for sure.

989
00:53:24,420 --> 00:53:25,590
For sure.
Absolutely.

990
00:53:25,591 --> 00:53:26,424
I mean I just came back from a bachelor 
party for one of my oldest friends I've 

991
00:53:29,641 --> 00:53:30,474
known since we were kids and a very 
eclectic group of guys who got to know 

992
00:53:38,281 --> 00:53:43,281
one another before anyone was really 
entrenched in a given career or anything

993
00:53:43,531 --> 00:53:47,130
like that.
And it's very refreshing to have a,

994
00:53:47,131 --> 00:53:51,870
I think in healthy to have those friends
who really don't have,

995
00:53:51,960 --> 00:53:52,793
there's no potential or at least i don't
think so would these guys certainly not 

996
00:53:55,891 --> 00:53:59,340
any type of ulterior motive or 
professional motivation.

997
00:53:59,341 --> 00:54:03,150
There's just none of that bs and noise 
and static and nonsense.

998
00:54:03,510 --> 00:54:04,500
Uh,
so yes,

999
00:54:04,560 --> 00:54:06,510
I do.
I do have those folks for sure.

1000
00:54:06,610 --> 00:54:07,443
Yeah.
How do you deal with that part of it 

1001
00:54:08,261 --> 00:54:13,261
that because of the nature of what you 
do and the public persona around you,

1002
00:54:13,720 --> 00:54:15,640
people want things from you all the 
time.

1003
00:54:16,890 --> 00:54:17,820
Yeah.
Oh yeah,

1004
00:54:17,850 --> 00:54:18,900
they do.
Uh,

1005
00:54:18,901 --> 00:54:23,901
and it's a tax that I've accepted I have
to pay and it,

1006
00:54:25,410 --> 00:54:26,243
I think it would be unreasonable for me 
to complain about it since it is a 

1007
00:54:30,031 --> 00:54:34,230
byproduct of public exposure,
which I've opted into,

1008
00:54:35,250 --> 00:54:36,083
but it can be frustrating.
I mean there are times when people will 

1009
00:54:39,451 --> 00:54:40,284
approach me and it,
and they'll try to butter me up for a 

1010
00:54:42,630 --> 00:54:43,463
few weeks and do me a bike.
It's always a tip off when I start 

1011
00:54:45,961 --> 00:54:50,961
getting a lot of unsolicited favors from
someone who doesn't want anything.

1012
00:54:52,291 --> 00:54:53,124
And I'm like,
I bet you're going to send me a book in 

1013
00:54:55,861 --> 00:54:56,694
two weeks that I don't want to read with
the expectation that I'm going to give 

1014
00:54:58,441 --> 00:55:00,150
you a blurb.
I bet that's what's going to happen.

1015
00:55:00,630 --> 00:55:03,060
And lo and behold,
that's exactly what happens.

1016
00:55:03,090 --> 00:55:03,923
So I've had to set policies that allow 
me to turn off entire categories of 

1017
00:55:10,831 --> 00:55:11,490
requests.

1018
00:55:11,490 --> 00:55:16,410
Like I don't do book forwards.
I don't do book blurbs.

1019
00:55:16,530 --> 00:55:17,363
I don't do fill in the blank across the 
board a hundred percent just don't do 

1020
00:55:19,771 --> 00:55:21,510
it.
And,

1021
00:55:21,600 --> 00:55:23,250
uh,
every once in a blue moon,

1022
00:55:23,251 --> 00:55:24,960
I'll make an exception for someone I 
know really well,

1023
00:55:24,961 --> 00:55:27,190
but it's very,
very rare,

1024
00:55:27,240 --> 00:55:28,290
uh,
or for instance,

1025
00:55:28,291 --> 00:55:30,180
right now,
like I'm not doing startup investing.

1026
00:55:30,300 --> 00:55:31,133
So if you think you're gonna come to a 
conference and talk to me about two or 

1027
00:55:33,721 --> 00:55:34,554
three things you found on my wikipedia 
page to try to develop some rapport and 

1028
00:55:37,621 --> 00:55:39,150
then pitch me or startup at the end of 
the night.

1029
00:55:39,600 --> 00:55:40,320
Not going to happen.

1030
00:55:40,320 --> 00:55:42,810
Oh man,
I was going to hit you up because,

1031
00:55:42,990 --> 00:55:44,850
you know,
we're growing pretty rapidly here,

1032
00:55:44,851 --> 00:55:46,470
but a little seed money,
you know what I'm saying?

1033
00:55:48,210 --> 00:55:50,150
And that happens all the time.
It's unbelievable.

1034
00:55:50,151 --> 00:55:50,900
I mean,
I've had,

1035
00:55:50,900 --> 00:55:53,630
I've had people in san francisco,
this is very unique to the,

1036
00:55:54,710 --> 00:55:55,543
uh,
somewhat like asperger's romanticizing 

1037
00:55:58,851 --> 00:56:01,880
niche nature of silicon valley.
But I mean,

1038
00:56:01,881 --> 00:56:02,714
I've had people I'm sitting at a dinner 
with say a girlfriend and they will 

1039
00:56:07,640 --> 00:56:09,770
literally come up,
pull up a chair,

1040
00:56:09,771 --> 00:56:13,550
sit down and just start pitching apropos
of nothing.

1041
00:56:13,551 --> 00:56:14,630
No intro,
no nothing.

1042
00:56:14,990 --> 00:56:17,850
I had one guy at south by southwest,
uh,

1043
00:56:18,120 --> 00:56:22,340
I've had at least 12 guys try to pitch 
me while I'm standing at a urinal,

1044
00:56:22,820 --> 00:56:24,190
which is the right time,

1045
00:56:24,250 --> 00:56:27,490
not a good elevator pitch you at that 
point.

1046
00:56:27,491 --> 00:56:28,324
It doesn't matter how

1047
00:56:28,380 --> 00:56:33,300
good your pitches and it goes on,
but I would say it's a text that,

1048
00:56:33,420 --> 00:56:35,680
that I've had to accept.
Um,

1049
00:56:35,790 --> 00:56:36,830
but I,
I,

1050
00:56:37,350 --> 00:56:38,310
I'm,
I'm,

1051
00:56:38,820 --> 00:56:43,820
I'm much more cautious about any open 
ended invite to have a conversation or a

1052
00:56:46,471 --> 00:56:48,090
coffee or a dinner.
So if someone says,

1053
00:56:48,091 --> 00:56:49,860
hey,
can I introduce you to my friend joe?

1054
00:56:49,861 --> 00:56:53,670
He wants to grab a cup of coffee or like
we'd love to come to dinner with us.

1055
00:56:53,671 --> 00:56:54,660
I'm like,
okay,

1056
00:56:55,560 --> 00:56:57,900
if joe wanted something from me,
what would it be?

1057
00:56:58,590 --> 00:57:00,750
What would you guess?
And I want to know in advance,

1058
00:57:00,751 --> 00:57:01,584
like it's okay to have a pitch,
but I want to know what it is 

1059
00:57:03,361 --> 00:57:04,450
beforehand.
Yeah.

1060
00:57:05,040 --> 00:57:06,990
So,
uh,

1061
00:57:07,080 --> 00:57:08,760
that's,
that's how I think of it these days.

1062
00:57:09,010 --> 00:57:09,810
All right,
well let's,

1063
00:57:09,810 --> 00:57:12,500
let's finish up by actually talking 
about your new book.

1064
00:57:12,501 --> 00:57:14,090
Are you willing to talk about your new 
book?

1065
00:57:14,510 --> 00:57:16,270
I am willing.
I know twist,

1066
00:57:16,310 --> 00:57:17,870
twist the arm,
but I'll go for it.

1067
00:57:17,970 --> 00:57:19,520
All right.
Let's see What we can do here.

1068
00:57:19,521 --> 00:57:20,354
so a tool to tighten.
So this is basically the collection of 

1069
00:57:23,390 --> 00:57:26,690
the best ideas,
the best practices that some of the most

1070
00:57:26,691 --> 00:57:27,524
interesting people that you've talked to
over the past couple of years have put 

1071
00:57:30,621 --> 00:57:34,370
into practice.
So I guess the easiest question at first

1072
00:57:34,371 --> 00:57:35,204
would be is there,
is there just the general theme with 

1073
00:57:37,281 --> 00:57:38,114
these heavy hitters,
with these people who are doing it that 

1074
00:57:40,491 --> 00:57:44,240
we all would want to emulate and be like
and learn from is what is the.

1075
00:57:44,270 --> 00:57:45,500
What is the general theme?

1076
00:57:46,560 --> 00:57:47,121
Yeah,
I'll,

1077
00:57:47,121 --> 00:57:47,954
I'll answer that.
And I would say also that in tools of 

1078
00:57:49,711 --> 00:57:51,780
titans is really never intended to be a 
book.

1079
00:57:51,810 --> 00:57:54,690
It was just a notebook that I was 
compiling for my own use,

1080
00:57:54,840 --> 00:57:59,840
so it was going back over my own notes 
to grab the most actionable routines and

1081
00:58:01,291 --> 00:58:02,400
tools,
gadgets,

1082
00:58:02,430 --> 00:58:03,263
anything that I could apply immediately 
and test from all of these different 

1083
00:58:06,240 --> 00:58:07,073
guests.
and one of the themes I would say that 

1084
00:58:11,850 --> 00:58:15,030
that first it's split into three 
sections,

1085
00:58:15,031 --> 00:58:17,610
and this is how a lot of these guests 
think about their lives,

1086
00:58:17,820 --> 00:58:18,541
healthy,
wealthy,

1087
00:58:18,541 --> 00:58:19,374
and wise,
and the healthiest first because the 

1088
00:58:22,890 --> 00:58:23,723
most prolific thinkers and creatives in 
the book have also come to highly 

1089
00:58:30,541 --> 00:58:35,460
prioritize physical function and uh,
that manifests in a lot of ways.

1090
00:58:35,461 --> 00:58:36,600
But for instance,
rick rubin,

1091
00:58:36,630 --> 00:58:39,480
one of the most legendary music 
traditionalist of the last 50 years,

1092
00:58:39,481 --> 00:58:41,190
introduced me to something called the 
chilly pad,

1093
00:58:41,820 --> 00:58:46,080
which I won't get too far into it,
but allows you to very precisely set the

1094
00:58:46,081 --> 00:58:48,660
temperature of the sheet that you lay on
your bed.

1095
00:58:48,690 --> 00:58:53,040
And it's been a complete game changer 
for me and many other people.

1096
00:58:53,041 --> 00:58:55,380
And that also came up with super 
athletes.

1097
00:58:55,381 --> 00:58:59,700
So you find a lot of commonalities in 
the top.

1098
00:58:59,701 --> 00:59:02,460
One percent have multiple fields.
In other words,

1099
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:06,120
they have more in common,
even though it might be chess,

1100
00:59:06,930 --> 00:59:09,300
military strategist,
black market chemists,

1101
00:59:09,360 --> 00:59:10,410
you name it,
the,

1102
00:59:10,770 --> 00:59:11,603
the top one percent.
And all of those fields have a lot in 

1103
00:59:13,051 --> 00:59:16,350
common more so than they have in common 
with the b players.

1104
00:59:16,351 --> 00:59:17,184
In their own fields,
so that was really cool to see all of 

1105
00:59:20,281 --> 00:59:21,114
them,
I would say are very good at asking 

1106
00:59:22,341 --> 00:59:24,950
seemingly absurd questions.
So,

1107
00:59:24,970 --> 00:59:27,800
so that that is a commonality across the
whole,

1108
00:59:27,980 --> 00:59:28,813
the whole gang.
So you would have say there are a bunch 

1109
00:59:30,681 --> 00:59:31,514
of billionaires in the book like the 
reid hoffman's and peter teals and marc 

1110
00:59:33,741 --> 00:59:35,360
andreessen's there.
There are a lot of folks.

1111
00:59:36,020 --> 00:59:37,940
A peter teal I think is a very good 
example.

1112
00:59:37,970 --> 00:59:41,630
So he asks questions like,
and I'm paraphrasing,

1113
00:59:41,631 --> 00:59:45,260
but why can't you accomplish your 10 
year plan in the next six months?

1114
00:59:45,860 --> 00:59:47,250
Right.
All right.

1115
00:59:47,310 --> 00:59:48,100
All right.
That's,

1116
00:59:48,100 --> 00:59:48,933
that's a very bold question and if 
you're going to think on that and as 

1117
00:59:53,511 --> 00:59:58,310
many people in this book do journal on 
it and actually sit down and freehand on

1118
00:59:58,311 --> 01:00:00,650
that question for three pages,
let's just say,

1119
01:00:01,370 --> 01:00:02,203
then you have to temporarily put aside 
the constraints and assumptions that 

1120
01:00:09,111 --> 01:00:12,020
have led you to where you are.
Because if it's your 10 year plan,

1121
01:00:12,440 --> 01:00:13,273
you've set a timeframe and sort of an 
incremental approach that doesn't work 

1122
01:00:16,371 --> 01:00:18,770
at all if you're trying to cram it into 
six months.

1123
01:00:18,930 --> 01:00:22,130
So all of a sudden you have to come up 
with these very,

1124
01:00:22,131 --> 01:00:27,131
very potentially outlandish and absurd 
unconventional answers.

1125
01:00:28,460 --> 01:00:30,130
And uh,
what,

1126
01:00:30,131 --> 01:00:34,520
what I have found also in these two go 
together is that a.

1127
01:00:34,520 --> 01:00:35,353
So for instance,
Larry Page co founder of google has 

1128
01:00:38,061 --> 01:00:39,350
said,
and I'm going to paraphrase this,

1129
01:00:39,351 --> 01:00:40,184
but what people miss about really big 
audacious goals is that it's hard to 

1130
01:00:46,341 --> 01:00:50,360
fail completely.
So you'll very often fail above everyone

1131
01:00:50,361 --> 01:00:54,930
else's success even if it's only a 
partial when I'm.

1132
01:00:55,440 --> 01:00:57,350
So you find a lot of that.
Like peter diamandis,

1133
01:00:57,351 --> 01:01:01,040
chairman of the xprize is working on all
these different exponential technologies

1134
01:01:01,640 --> 01:01:04,640
and spends a lot of time with people 
like ray kurzweil,

1135
01:01:04,641 --> 01:01:05,474
James Cameron and so on.
When entrepreneurs are pitching him to 

1136
01:01:08,661 --> 01:01:11,240
try to get investment,
he will ask them,

1137
01:01:11,300 --> 01:01:12,133
and I'm paraphrasing all of these,
but if you had to 10 x the economics of 

1138
01:01:15,381 --> 01:01:18,170
your business in the next three months,
what would you do?

1139
01:01:18,500 --> 01:01:21,260
And if their response is,
that's impossible.

1140
01:01:21,890 --> 01:01:24,680
He responds with,
I don't accept that answer.

1141
01:01:24,710 --> 01:01:27,500
TrY again.
And so,

1142
01:01:27,750 --> 01:01:28,583
but,
but to get unusual output and to find 

1143
01:01:34,280 --> 01:01:37,980
paths that are unique,
that are not well trodden,

1144
01:01:38,030 --> 01:01:41,000
you have to ask better questions.

1145
01:01:41,240 --> 01:01:42,860
So I'd saY that's very,
very common.

1146
01:01:43,220 --> 01:01:44,053
More than 80 percent of the people in 
the book also have some type of 

1147
01:01:45,801 --> 01:01:48,950
mindfulness practice which could take 
the form of meditation,

1148
01:01:48,980 --> 01:01:52,550
say using a guided meditation.
There's one that came up a few times,

1149
01:01:52,850 --> 01:01:54,170
which is free,
called the,

1150
01:01:54,660 --> 01:01:59,300
the 2010 summer smile meditation,
which is by tara brock.

1151
01:01:59,330 --> 01:02:00,163
Super specific.
But that one came up multiple times for 

1152
01:02:03,111 --> 01:02:03,944
instance,
or people using headspace in the 

1153
01:02:05,740 --> 01:02:06,573
mornings.
Arnold schwartzenegger ended up using 

1154
01:02:08,361 --> 01:02:09,194
transcendental meditation for a year 
twice a day and then saw benefits for 

1155
01:02:12,021 --> 01:02:12,854
decades afterwards,
which is really wild when you think 

1156
01:02:14,541 --> 01:02:15,520
about it.
Uh,

1157
01:02:15,680 --> 01:02:18,530
other commonalities.
So I asked almost all of the guests,

1158
01:02:18,680 --> 01:02:20,760
what have you gifted most to other 
people?

1159
01:02:20,780 --> 01:02:21,613
Yeah,
there are certain books that popped up 

1160
01:02:22,860 --> 01:02:25,110
over and over again that are maybe 
lesser known,

1161
01:02:25,111 --> 01:02:27,630
like poor charlie's almanack by charlie 
munger,

1162
01:02:28,110 --> 01:02:29,580
who's warren buffet's right hand man.

1163
01:02:29,580 --> 01:02:32,850
But who gets less of the media 
spotlight?

1164
01:02:32,851 --> 01:02:35,820
Because I think he quite frankly hates 
being in the spotlight.

1165
01:02:36,450 --> 01:02:37,283
He'S pretty cantankerous dude,
but an Incredible book that came up 

1166
01:02:40,891 --> 01:02:42,870
repeatedly with some of the wealthiest 
people.

1167
01:02:43,210 --> 01:02:44,043
A siddhartha by herman hesse,
came up repeatedly by some of the best 

1168
01:02:48,901 --> 01:02:53,400
musicians and investors go figure.
Right?

1169
01:02:53,401 --> 01:02:54,234
So there are sapiens was another one 
that came up across the board 

1170
01:02:58,170 --> 01:02:59,003
repeatedly.
So these are the types of things that 

1171
01:03:01,261 --> 01:03:03,060
you spot.
There's some weird ones like,

1172
01:03:03,061 --> 01:03:05,250
um,
males over the age of say,

1173
01:03:05,251 --> 01:03:09,420
45,
a very high percentage of them don't eat

1174
01:03:09,421 --> 01:03:14,160
breakfast at all or only eat one primary
meal per day,

1175
01:03:14,220 --> 01:03:17,100
usually early dinner.
That came up a lot.

1176
01:03:17,640 --> 01:03:20,820
So you have,
that's totally conventional wisdom,

1177
01:03:20,821 --> 01:03:21,960
right?
Yeah,

1178
01:03:21,961 --> 01:03:22,531
it's,
it's,

1179
01:03:22,531 --> 01:03:23,364
it's a,
it's for the most part runs completely 

1180
01:03:26,521 --> 01:03:27,354
counter to conventional wisdom.
But if you look into the scientific 

1181
01:03:29,521 --> 01:03:33,120
literature,
which I've done a even for females,

1182
01:03:33,121 --> 01:03:33,954
it looks,
it appears as though there's some data 

1183
01:03:36,121 --> 01:03:40,440
to suggest that as you get older you 
actually consume protein,

1184
01:03:40,441 --> 01:03:43,650
for instance,
better in a single large bolus,

1185
01:03:43,651 --> 01:03:44,670
a single large dose.

1186
01:03:44,670 --> 01:03:46,770
So rather than having like a 
bodybuilder,

1187
01:03:46,771 --> 01:03:48,690
a meal every four hours or whatever it 
is,

1188
01:03:48,691 --> 01:03:51,660
even three meals a day,
if you're a 70 year old,

1189
01:03:51,661 --> 01:03:52,494
80 year old,
you will actually consume your protein 

1190
01:03:54,961 --> 01:03:55,794
more efficiently,
having the majority in one meal and go 

1191
01:03:59,521 --> 01:04:00,810
figure.
So it seems to,

1192
01:04:00,840 --> 01:04:01,673
seems to correspond,
but there's a bunch of weird stuff like 

1193
01:04:03,571 --> 01:04:08,571
that that pops up over and over.
Have any of these titans told,

1194
01:04:08,971 --> 01:04:12,930
knew something or given you some wisdom 
that you tried to put into practice?

1195
01:04:12,931 --> 01:04:14,190
And then we're like,
man,

1196
01:04:14,490 --> 01:04:17,790
that does not work for me.
Uh,

1197
01:04:18,030 --> 01:04:19,380
well,
uh,

1198
01:04:19,500 --> 01:04:20,670
yes,
definitely.

1199
01:04:20,760 --> 01:04:21,420
Uh,
and,

1200
01:04:21,420 --> 01:04:25,770
and the good news is for every pattern,
there's someone who will let you off the

1201
01:04:25,771 --> 01:04:26,530
hook.
That's,

1202
01:04:26,530 --> 01:04:27,840
that's,
that's the good news.

1203
01:04:27,870 --> 01:04:30,950
So you can really,
the objective is,

1204
01:04:31,230 --> 01:04:35,250
is to create your own bespoke toolkit.
Right?

1205
01:04:35,730 --> 01:04:36,563
And for instance,
there are a lot of people who wake up 

1206
01:04:39,750 --> 01:04:40,740
very early.

1207
01:04:40,920 --> 01:04:43,020
You have people,
amelia boone,

1208
01:04:43,021 --> 01:04:45,480
who is this incredible super athlete,
jocko willink,

1209
01:04:46,020 --> 01:04:48,360
a long list of folks who wake up at say 
4:30

1210
01:04:48,361 --> 01:04:51,180
in the morning.
So I've tried that,

1211
01:04:51,210 --> 01:04:54,030
but I'm much better going to bed around 
4:30

1212
01:04:54,031 --> 01:04:57,930
in the morning and uh,
so I would lean more towards say,

1213
01:04:57,931 --> 01:04:59,540
the bj novak said,
you know,

1214
01:04:59,610 --> 01:05:04,610
writers and comedians and so on who 
can't even really hit their groove until

1215
01:05:05,221 --> 01:05:06,054
11:00
AM.

1216
01:05:06,330 --> 01:05:07,770
That's more my speed.
But yeah,

1217
01:05:07,771 --> 01:05:10,320
the,
the waking up with the amish,

1218
01:05:10,650 --> 01:05:11,770
not my thing.
I can't,

1219
01:05:11,780 --> 01:05:13,650
I can't,
I can't really make that work for me.

1220
01:05:13,680 --> 01:05:14,850
Not,
not anytime soon.

1221
01:05:15,190 --> 01:05:18,430
So do you think some of this is just how
you're hardwired

1222
01:05:18,460 --> 01:05:21,220
versus how you can actually learn to 
train yourself?

1223
01:05:21,280 --> 01:05:24,430
Like something like that.
I would guess that knowing you,

1224
01:05:24,431 --> 01:05:28,630
you could probably overcome that if you 
put enough time into it.

1225
01:05:28,631 --> 01:05:31,690
You may not feel that that's worthy of 
putting time into,

1226
01:05:31,870 --> 01:05:32,703
but how much is that battle between just
the way you're hardwired in nature 

1227
01:05:35,530 --> 01:05:37,510
versus the desire to change yourself?

1228
01:05:38,480 --> 01:05:39,180
Well,
I think you've,

1229
01:05:39,180 --> 01:05:40,013
I think you can see the good news is 
that everything in tools of titans is 

1230
01:05:43,550 --> 01:05:47,900
intended to be a one day or one week 
experiment,

1231
01:05:48,020 --> 01:05:49,100
right?
So you can try it.

1232
01:05:49,370 --> 01:05:52,430
And uh,
as Bruce Lee said,

1233
01:05:52,460 --> 01:05:53,810
something along these lines,
he said,

1234
01:05:53,990 --> 01:05:55,520
except what is useful,
reject,

1235
01:05:55,521 --> 01:05:57,410
what is useless,
add what is uniquely your own.

1236
01:05:57,411 --> 01:06:02,411
So I've tried to do the morning thing 
and I'm just better,

1237
01:06:02,980 --> 01:06:05,960
yeah,
going to bed late and waking up late and

1238
01:06:06,050 --> 01:06:06,620
uh,
I,

1239
01:06:06,620 --> 01:06:08,450
I'm okay with that.
I've accepted that.

1240
01:06:08,451 --> 01:06:12,080
I don't beat myself up over it.
And uh,

1241
01:06:13,280 --> 01:06:15,170
there is definitely a hard wiring 
component.

1242
01:06:15,171 --> 01:06:16,004
I mean,
some people need only three hours of 

1243
01:06:17,661 --> 01:06:19,910
sleep per night.
I know a bunch of these mutants,

1244
01:06:20,420 --> 01:06:21,253
the vast majority of people will do best
on say seven and a half to 10 hours of 

1245
01:06:24,711 --> 01:06:25,544
sleep per night.
And I would say maybe 30 percent of the 

1246
01:06:28,941 --> 01:06:31,190
people I've spoken to that I've talked 
to about this,

1247
01:06:31,430 --> 01:06:36,430
we'll try to get some type of short nap 
in the say mid afternoon between 2:30

1248
01:06:37,640 --> 01:06:39,260
and 4:00.

1249
01:06:39,370 --> 01:06:40,290
So it's,
it's,

1250
01:06:40,370 --> 01:06:43,750
there are certain personalized elements,
uh,

1251
01:06:43,820 --> 01:06:46,640
that are dependent on your genetic 
makeup or at least,

1252
01:06:46,950 --> 01:06:49,100
uh,
influenced by your genetic makeup.

1253
01:06:49,160 --> 01:06:49,993
But I mean,
in reality is more negotiable than I 

1254
01:06:51,771 --> 01:06:53,960
think people realize.
Even that stuff,

1255
01:06:53,961 --> 01:06:56,510
you can override it if you want to for 
periods of time,

1256
01:06:57,010 --> 01:06:57,843
you can,
you can use something like polyphasic 

1257
01:06:59,181 --> 01:07:02,970
sleep and combine that with something 
called exoticness ketones.

1258
01:07:03,010 --> 01:07:03,843
IT's powdered form of alternate energy.
Basically you combine those two things 

1259
01:07:07,501 --> 01:07:08,334
that you could probably do like two,
two and half hours of sleep per day for 

1260
01:07:12,171 --> 01:07:16,430
a few weeks at a time and I've done that
before in dire situations,

1261
01:07:16,431 --> 01:07:19,760
but it's not something you want to try 
to sustain

1262
01:07:19,940 --> 01:07:20,930
for.
Man.

1263
01:07:20,931 --> 01:07:21,764
I should've,
I should've talked to you about a month 

1264
01:07:22,760 --> 01:07:25,190
ago because I couldn't use it with bud.
Alright.

1265
01:07:25,280 --> 01:07:28,490
I'm going to end this with the most 
softball question of all time.

1266
01:07:28,970 --> 01:07:33,560
If you had one book that you wanted 
people to go out and read right now,

1267
01:07:33,950 --> 01:07:36,230
go out and buy a book,
you know what I mean?

1268
01:07:36,231 --> 01:07:38,510
Digital hard copy,
whatever it is.

1269
01:07:38,870 --> 01:07:40,220
What book would that be?

1270
01:07:40,850 --> 01:07:44,150
I would,
I would have to recommend not biased.

1271
01:07:44,470 --> 01:07:45,303
Uh,
I would have to recommend tools of 

1272
01:07:46,221 --> 01:07:51,221
titans because this is the first book I 
enjoyed writing and it is the first book

1273
01:07:53,720 --> 01:07:58,720
that I have since writing re-read 
multiple times because the,

1274
01:07:59,220 --> 01:08:02,300
the tools and tactics and 
recommendations are not just mine.

1275
01:08:02,330 --> 01:08:03,163
It's not me listening to myself.
This is the best practices of 200 world 

1276
01:08:06,741 --> 01:08:10,580
class performance from every possible 
discipline you can imagine.

1277
01:08:10,670 --> 01:08:13,520
and um,
as of right now on amazon,

1278
01:08:13,521 --> 01:08:18,110
I think it has 410 reviews straight.
I mean it's a five star average.

1279
01:08:18,410 --> 01:08:20,570
It's like 87 percent have given it five 
stars.

1280
01:08:20,780 --> 01:08:21,680
Come on.
I think.

1281
01:08:21,681 --> 01:08:23,460
I know you're refreshing as we're 
talking.

1282
01:08:23,461 --> 01:08:25,460
I'm come on now.
Oh yeah,

1283
01:08:25,461 --> 01:08:26,870
no,
the compulsive amazon check.

1284
01:08:27,080 --> 01:08:27,980
I mean,
don't get me wrong,

1285
01:08:28,280 --> 01:08:29,660
there's no author.
Well,

1286
01:08:29,661 --> 01:08:31,010
I shouldn't say no other,
no other.

1287
01:08:31,011 --> 01:08:34,160
I know who is immune to that during 
launch week for sure.

1288
01:08:34,210 --> 01:08:36,470
You having that level of peace yet,
you know,

1289
01:08:36,500 --> 01:08:38,620
have high level nothing yet.
No.

1290
01:08:38,660 --> 01:08:40,060
During launch week,
yeah.

1291
01:08:40,310 --> 01:08:44,120
Every author is just like a rat with a 
cocaine pellet dispenser checking amazon

1292
01:08:44,360 --> 01:08:45,590
if we're being honest.
But yeah,

1293
01:08:45,920 --> 01:08:48,290
tools of titans is what I'd recommend.
It's,

1294
01:08:48,350 --> 01:08:49,183
it's,
uh,

1295
01:08:49,250 --> 01:08:53,390
I think very appropriate for all age 
levels,

1296
01:08:53,990 --> 01:08:54,823
incredibly flexible gift.
There's something in it for everybody 

1297
01:08:57,321 --> 01:09:01,010
and it's really intended so that you can
sit down with a cup of tea or coffee and

1298
01:09:01,460 --> 01:09:04,640
get a chapter in that period of time,
but the time you finished that cub.

1299
01:09:04,700 --> 01:09:09,140
So it's a,
it's a fun book and a very proud of it.

1300
01:09:09,141 --> 01:09:11,270
So if people feel so inclined,
I would,

1301
01:09:11,330 --> 01:09:13,340
I would encourage them to check out 
tools of titans.

1302
01:09:13,490 --> 01:09:13,971
All right,
well,

1303
01:09:13,971 --> 01:09:16,510
you know what we're gonna do,
we're gonna put the link to tools to tie

1304
01:09:16,511 --> 01:09:18,800
it in the comment thing right down 
below.

1305
01:09:18,830 --> 01:09:23,830
And we will see if the dave rubin effect
is as powerful as the tim paris.

1306
01:09:25,640 --> 01:09:26,900
I can't wait.
Can't wait to see it.

1307
01:09:26,901 --> 01:09:27,734
And people can keep.
People can find retailers all over the 

1308
01:09:29,361 --> 01:09:31,250
world if they want or you know,
amazon.

1309
01:09:31,251 --> 01:09:32,840
So on,
at tools of titans.com.

1310
01:09:32,841 --> 01:09:36,080
There also some sample chapters forward 
from arnold schwarzenegger.

1311
01:09:36,500 --> 01:09:37,600
It's wild.
Um,

1312
01:09:37,850 --> 01:09:38,661
so yes,
we will,

1313
01:09:38,661 --> 01:09:40,310
we will see,
we will see what happens.

1314
01:09:40,320 --> 01:09:41,720
I,
I'm looking forward to it.

1315
01:09:41,940 --> 01:09:42,790
All right man.
Well listen,

1316
01:09:42,791 --> 01:09:43,624
we did a.
I think we did over an hour here and I 

1317
01:09:45,311 --> 01:09:46,910
know you only have a four hour work 
week.

1318
01:09:47,120 --> 01:09:49,400
Very appreciative of your time.
You're welcome.

1319
01:09:49,401 --> 01:09:50,390
My pleasure,
man.

1320
01:09:50,510 --> 01:09:51,740
AlrigHt,
thanks to tim ferriss,
