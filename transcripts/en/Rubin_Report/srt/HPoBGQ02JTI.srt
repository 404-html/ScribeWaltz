1
00:00:05,140 --> 00:00:08,080
I'm pretty sure you all know that I'm a 
small government guy.

2
00:00:08,140 --> 00:00:11,950
What's small government means to me,
at least economically is that you should

3
00:00:11,951 --> 00:00:12,784
keep most of what you earn and that you 
yourself are the best arbiter to decide 

4
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:17,793
where your money goes,
whether the money you are and goes to 

5
00:00:20,021 --> 00:00:20,854
fixing your house or buying a new car or
to funding planned parenthood and 

6
00:00:23,771 --> 00:00:27,220
supporting Lincoln Center.
I believe that should be up to you.

7
00:00:27,490 --> 00:00:29,110
You've worked hard for your money,
I assume,

8
00:00:29,111 --> 00:00:32,980
and I believe that you're a better judge
of how to spend it rather than giving it

9
00:00:32,981 --> 00:00:33,814
to a wasteful government,
which will often spend it on programs 

10
00:00:36,401 --> 00:00:39,070
that you don't even care about.
At the same time,

11
00:00:39,100 --> 00:00:43,930
being for small government isn't only 
about taxes and economics at its root.

12
00:00:43,931 --> 00:00:48,490
Being for small government is also about
being for the individual.

13
00:00:48,820 --> 00:00:49,653
I believe that your faculty to 
understand how you want to live is far 

14
00:00:52,781 --> 00:00:56,950
better than anyone else's faculty on how
you should live your life.

15
00:00:57,340 --> 00:00:59,920
At the same time,
I understand the need for the government

16
00:00:59,921 --> 00:01:04,780
is different depending on whether you 
live in a rural area or an urban center.

17
00:01:04,781 --> 00:01:07,690
For example,
in a rural area with less people,

18
00:01:07,691 --> 00:01:08,524
there is most likely less of a need for 
regulation than there is in an urban 

19
00:01:11,831 --> 00:01:12,664
area.
Take something as simple as a noise 

20
00:01:14,231 --> 00:01:16,330
ordinance.
If you live in a remote,

21
00:01:16,331 --> 00:01:17,164
rural area in the middle of the country,
there is most likely no need for a law 

22
00:01:20,321 --> 00:01:21,154
to stop people from doing construction 
in the middle of the night or blasting 

23
00:01:23,921 --> 00:01:26,890
their music too loudly.
But if you live in an urban center,

24
00:01:26,891 --> 00:01:30,910
Say New York City where people live in 
small apartments on top of one another.

25
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:33,340
A noise ordinance might be important to 
you.

26
00:01:33,550 --> 00:01:34,383
You can't have construction people 
knocking down walls at all hours of the 

27
00:01:36,371 --> 00:01:40,450
night and you might not want your 
neighbor blasting music at 3:00

28
00:01:40,450 --> 00:01:40,570
AM.

29
00:01:40,570 --> 00:01:41,403
The next piece of the limited government
puzzle is whether or not the government 

30
00:01:43,721 --> 00:01:46,750
needs to be involved in so many facets 
of our lives at all.

31
00:01:46,900 --> 00:01:47,733
Even in the case of New York City with 
it's cramped conditions and tiny living 

32
00:01:50,261 --> 00:01:51,094
spaces,
is it the government who has to tell 

33
00:01:52,571 --> 00:01:53,404
companies not to do construction in the 
middle of the night or tenants not to 

34
00:01:56,201 --> 00:01:57,034
blast music at ungodly hours?
This is where an interesting discussion 

35
00:02:00,341 --> 00:02:01,174
can happen.
Is it the job of the government as laid 

36
00:02:03,371 --> 00:02:06,430
out by the constitution,
which I think we're still governed by to

37
00:02:06,431 --> 00:02:07,264
regulate these interpersonal issues,
or is it the job of individuals to deal 

38
00:02:11,771 --> 00:02:12,604
with these issues themselves?
Should a building in New York City have 

39
00:02:15,131 --> 00:02:17,950
a policy about noise instead of leaving 
it to the government?

40
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:19,113
Should it be incumbent on you to talk to
your neighbor about the volume of their 

41
00:02:22,151 --> 00:02:24,010
music rather than leaving it to the 
government?

42
00:02:24,490 --> 00:02:25,323
Can issues we think of traditionally 
being dealt with by the government 

43
00:02:28,211 --> 00:02:29,044
actually be dealt with in the private 
sector or is the government already too 

44
00:02:33,251 --> 00:02:36,910
deep into controlling us that we could 
never scale it back without burning down

45
00:02:36,911 --> 00:02:37,744
the system?

46
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:40,990
While noise ordinances aren't the most 
pressing issue out there?

47
00:02:41,020 --> 00:02:41,853
Obviously I use it as a simple example 
of the battle between the private and 

48
00:02:45,221 --> 00:02:46,054
the public and how sometimes we assign 
power to the government when perhaps 

49
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:51,003
there could be a better option based in 
our own capacity to reason for 

50
00:02:54,011 --> 00:02:56,050
ourselves.
With all this in mind,

51
00:02:56,051 --> 00:02:56,884
we're continuing our partnership with 
learn liberty this week and me is best 

52
00:02:59,801 --> 00:03:02,920
selling author and economist at George 
Mason University,

53
00:03:02,921 --> 00:03:06,220
Bryan Caplan.
Brian is in a narco capitalists,

54
00:03:06,221 --> 00:03:07,054
which in simple terms is an extreme 
libertarian who wants government pretty 

55
00:03:10,721 --> 00:03:13,090
much out of everything.
We'll talk about taxes,

56
00:03:13,091 --> 00:03:14,380
healthcare,
rent control,

57
00:03:14,530 --> 00:03:15,363
and much more and see if there are 
places that the private sector can 

58
00:03:18,761 --> 00:03:22,090
actually do a better job than what the 
public has been able to do.

59
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:23,920
Now,
according to us,

60
00:03:23,921 --> 00:03:25,510
penal code four,
two nine.

61
00:03:25,511 --> 00:03:28,570
Pursuant to the laws of the state in 
which you are governed,

62
00:03:28,571 --> 00:03:31,720
you are hereby ordered to click like and
comment down below.

63
00:03:36,980 --> 00:03:39,410
We're continuing our partnership with 
learn liberty this week,

64
00:03:39,411 --> 00:03:43,790
and joining me today is a professor of 
economics at George Mason University,

65
00:03:44,030 --> 00:03:49,000
an author and a narco capitalist.
End a pacifist Brian Kaplan.

66
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:51,290
Welcome to the Rubin report.
Thanks a lot for having me.

67
00:03:51,590 --> 00:03:55,310
Lot of good buzzwords in there and we're
going to get to all of them,

68
00:03:55,700 --> 00:03:56,533
but first,
what's it like being a professor on 

69
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:03,740
campus these days that doesn't identify 
as a progressive?

70
00:04:04,130 --> 00:04:04,963
Is that tough?
Are you getting rocks thrown at you 

71
00:04:05,991 --> 00:04:07,100
every day?
How's that gone?

72
00:04:07,420 --> 00:04:09,490
My life is perfectly fine.
Nothing's ever had.

73
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:11,140
Nothing bad's ever happened to be.
I don't even know.

74
00:04:11,141 --> 00:04:14,050
I've never gotten a negative comment on 
a student evaluation.

75
00:04:14,380 --> 00:04:15,213
To be fair,
I'm in the Economics Department at 

76
00:04:16,241 --> 00:04:20,290
George Mason University,
which is a very unusual place.

77
00:04:20,291 --> 00:04:23,980
There's a lot of libertarian and free 
market oriented people there,

78
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:25,263
but also what I say is that the stories 
that you hear on the media while 

79
00:04:30,221 --> 00:04:31,054
generally true,
if you remember how many people are on 

80
00:04:33,071 --> 00:04:34,570
campus,
how many professors there are,

81
00:04:34,571 --> 00:04:35,404
so if every week you see some horrible 
thing happens to one professor that 

82
00:04:38,711 --> 00:04:41,200
still leaves the 99 point nine,
nine,

83
00:04:41,580 --> 00:04:42,413
nine percent of all professors who had a
perfectly find week and so far so good 

84
00:04:46,930 --> 00:04:47,460
for me.

85
00:04:47,460 --> 00:04:48,900
Yeah,
and you make a point of saying you're in

86
00:04:48,901 --> 00:04:51,780
the economics department,
which is probably insulated from some of

87
00:04:51,781 --> 00:04:55,800
this stuff's because you have to work 
with facts and figures and numbers.

88
00:04:55,801 --> 00:04:59,400
These are sort of outside of the realm 
of where social justice can hit.

89
00:04:59,401 --> 00:05:00,020
Right?
Right.

90
00:05:00,020 --> 00:05:00,853
So just know economics says a long 
history of field where you can say 

91
00:05:03,381 --> 00:05:04,214
really controversial and shocking things
and people are curious and want to talk 

92
00:05:06,951 --> 00:05:10,250
about it in a civilized way rather than 
get really mad at you.

93
00:05:10,251 --> 00:05:11,084
So I'd say at least half of the 
controversial ideas in academia have 

94
00:05:15,591 --> 00:05:20,270
come out of economics and economists get
Nobel prizes for these ideas.

95
00:05:20,271 --> 00:05:20,630
It's,
you know,

96
00:05:20,630 --> 00:05:21,463
Gary Becker and Milton Friedman.
It's not like people are waiting around 

97
00:05:24,681 --> 00:05:26,600
for you to say the wrong thing and jump 
on you,

98
00:05:27,070 --> 00:05:27,903
uh,
you said to me then you have the real 

99
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,580
difference is just people who are very 
dull.

100
00:05:31,581 --> 00:05:33,110
There are.
Economists were very boring,

101
00:05:33,380 --> 00:05:35,990
but it's not like they're angry at 
people for doing other stuff.

102
00:05:35,991 --> 00:05:38,210
They're just not doing really exciting 
work.

103
00:05:38,630 --> 00:05:39,463
But there's plenty of room in economics 
for people to say almost anything 

104
00:05:41,901 --> 00:05:43,940
really.
And not only get away with it,

105
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:46,160
but to succeed,
meaning I mean,

106
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:47,660
mean,
I've long been telling people like,

107
00:05:47,661 --> 00:05:48,494
if you really want to be a professor,
tried to figure out how to repackage 

108
00:05:52,281 --> 00:05:54,080
what you're,
what you want to do with economics,

109
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:57,110
and then just get a Phd Phd economics,
you'll make more money,

110
00:05:57,140 --> 00:05:58,310
you'll get tenure or you'll get an 
email,

111
00:05:58,311 --> 00:06:02,060
you'll get a job easily and you'll be in
a very supportive atmosphere.

112
00:06:02,060 --> 00:06:05,270
We can say you want,
I can tell you truly believe in the free

113
00:06:05,271 --> 00:06:07,970
market because you're welcoming people 
to take your job right now.

114
00:06:07,971 --> 00:06:09,050
That's a,
that's pretty good.

115
00:06:09,380 --> 00:06:13,730
Ten years.
So I'm not that worried in that way.

116
00:06:13,731 --> 00:06:14,564
But um,
and also remember that the more people 

117
00:06:16,790 --> 00:06:19,940
in order for in order to become a vestry
first have to become one of my customers

118
00:06:19,941 --> 00:06:20,774
and go to Grad school.
So naturally it's not as on self 

119
00:06:23,490 --> 00:06:24,560
interest might seem.
Yeah.

120
00:06:24,890 --> 00:06:27,260
Do you find that professors of 
economics,

121
00:06:27,261 --> 00:06:29,780
either George Mason or you were just 
mentioning a debate,

122
00:06:29,781 --> 00:06:30,614
you're doing it in a couple of days,
that generally professors of economics 

123
00:06:33,711 --> 00:06:35,070
from whatever,
uh,

124
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:38,180
you know,
whatever pathology they believe in,

125
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:39,273
uh,
are able to debate and it doesn't get 

126
00:06:40,851 --> 00:06:43,280
personal and it can really stick on the 
issues and that kind of thing.

127
00:06:43,730 --> 00:06:44,570
So,
uh,

128
00:06:44,630 --> 00:06:46,040
in general I'd say yes.

129
00:06:46,250 --> 00:06:47,083
Again,
the main problem is just people who are 

130
00:06:48,741 --> 00:06:52,850
not interested in bigger ideas and only 
want to focus on their research topics.

131
00:06:53,060 --> 00:06:55,610
So people like that are not touchy.
They're not hostile,

132
00:06:55,820 --> 00:06:59,270
they're just apathetic or they use.
Sometimes they'll have the idea of,

133
00:06:59,290 --> 00:07:00,123
you know,
what you are doing is not science and I 

134
00:07:01,281 --> 00:07:03,320
don't really care about that and you 
don't belong here,

135
00:07:03,321 --> 00:07:07,700
but it's not that they disagree with 
what you're saying as they disagree with

136
00:07:07,970 --> 00:07:10,580
people taking on bigger questions of any
kinds.

137
00:07:11,020 --> 00:07:12,050
So that,
I mean,

138
00:07:12,051 --> 00:07:12,884
again,
that's sort of what I've dealt with in 

139
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:18,620
my time in academia is just I want to do
big exciting ideas.

140
00:07:18,830 --> 00:07:19,663
And a lot of economists frown on that,
not because they disagree with the 

141
00:07:21,801 --> 00:07:23,750
content because they disagree with 
anything.

142
00:07:23,751 --> 00:07:24,550
Begging.
Exciting.

143
00:07:24,550 --> 00:07:25,383
Yeah.
So before we get into some of your big 

144
00:07:26,401 --> 00:07:27,234
and exciting ideas,
do you find that generally outside of 

145
00:07:30,501 --> 00:07:31,334
the universities that just the American 
populace really doesn't understand 

146
00:07:34,940 --> 00:07:37,580
anything about economics because this is
what I see all the time,

147
00:07:37,750 --> 00:07:38,583
you know,
I can only garner so much information 

148
00:07:40,101 --> 00:07:40,934
from social media,
but I see people saying things about 

149
00:07:42,831 --> 00:07:43,664
trade all the time and immigration all 
the time and all these things that are 

150
00:07:45,981 --> 00:07:50,540
tied back into economics and I'm like,
you don't really seem to know much about

151
00:07:50,630 --> 00:07:51,350
anything.

152
00:07:51,350 --> 00:07:52,183
Yeah.
So I have a whole book on this called 

153
00:07:52,971 --> 00:07:55,230
the myth of the rational voter democracy
issues,

154
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:56,073
bad policies in the book.
I just go over all the evidence on what 

155
00:07:59,061 --> 00:07:59,894
does the public actually believe about 
economics compared to what anyone who 

156
00:08:03,231 --> 00:08:05,390
can explain the textbook.
Thanks.

157
00:08:05,690 --> 00:08:07,160
And yeah,
it's terrible.

158
00:08:08,330 --> 00:08:11,540
Why do you think about it is so mean.
Right now we're in la.

159
00:08:11,541 --> 00:08:15,470
I grew up here,
so I will say that until I was 17,

160
00:08:15,740 --> 00:08:18,980
I never heard any argument against the 
minimum wage.

161
00:08:19,070 --> 00:08:22,460
I never heard any argument against 
regulation of pharmaceuticals.

162
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:25,550
I don't think I ever heard any argument 
against the welfare state ever.

163
00:08:25,700 --> 00:08:28,160
And again,
I was not growing up in Berkeley or some

164
00:08:28,190 --> 00:08:30,890
some left wing haven.
I've just growing up in a normal,

165
00:08:30,891 --> 00:08:33,710
boring middle class suburb here in Los 
Angeles.

166
00:08:34,100 --> 00:08:34,933
But the kinds of arguments that 
economists make and are aware of are 

167
00:08:37,791 --> 00:08:39,710
just not even on people's radar.

168
00:08:40,130 --> 00:08:42,650
So that's an important distinction that 
you just said there that you didn't grow

169
00:08:42,651 --> 00:08:45,020
up in Berkeley.
You grew up in a suburb of Los Angeles.

170
00:08:45,021 --> 00:08:48,380
That's somewhat blue collar.
Elliot middle,

171
00:08:48,381 --> 00:08:49,700
middle class,
the middle class,

172
00:08:49,701 --> 00:08:50,534
middle class,
yeah,

173
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:52,370
it was,
it was,

174
00:08:52,370 --> 00:08:53,203
it was probably could easily been half 
Republican in days and still like I'd 

175
00:08:57,861 --> 00:08:58,694
never heard any of the very basic 
economic arguments critiquing standard 

176
00:09:02,611 --> 00:09:05,130
popular regulations.
You Indian.

177
00:09:05,180 --> 00:09:07,510
So it's like everyone really like,
you know,

178
00:09:07,620 --> 00:09:09,450
talking to my parents about rent control
and you know,

179
00:09:09,451 --> 00:09:10,284
they didn't understand anything about 
the economist critique of rent control 

180
00:09:12,451 --> 00:09:13,284
and how it caused.
How it causes a shortage in housing for 

181
00:09:15,121 --> 00:09:15,661
them,
it's just like,

182
00:09:15,661 --> 00:09:17,820
well we own a rental property so we're 
against it.

183
00:09:18,130 --> 00:09:20,310
It was sort of all that they could come 
up with.

184
00:09:20,390 --> 00:09:20,990
Right.
Uh,

185
00:09:20,990 --> 00:09:21,880
so you know,
so you know,

186
00:09:22,030 --> 00:09:23,790
this is,
this is very,

187
00:09:23,810 --> 00:09:25,950
very standard for the,
you know,

188
00:09:25,951 --> 00:09:28,380
not just the American public but the 
global,

189
00:09:28,381 --> 00:09:29,214
but the global public and throughout 
history is just like the very basic 

190
00:09:31,771 --> 00:09:32,604
ideas of economics that are in every 
textbook are not known and when they're 

191
00:09:36,811 --> 00:09:38,010
heard this is this regular thing.

192
00:09:38,010 --> 00:09:38,843
So it's one thing to never heard them,
but northern normal reaction is just 

193
00:09:41,371 --> 00:09:43,140
anger.
So I say,

194
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:46,260
well they're so insulated from any other
idea basically.

195
00:09:46,290 --> 00:09:47,640
Right.
And also it just like,

196
00:09:47,641 --> 00:09:49,600
it just like,
why are you saying this while?

197
00:09:49,730 --> 00:09:50,563
Can't we have the minimum wage?
It's a program to go and help poor 

198
00:09:53,251 --> 00:09:54,084
people.
And then an economist comes along and 

199
00:09:55,471 --> 00:09:58,020
says there's a downside.
This could cause unemployment.

200
00:09:58,260 --> 00:10:01,600
And people's reaction is how could you 
say something like that?

201
00:10:01,601 --> 00:10:04,080
So that's so terrible.
Or only what kind of like you hate,

202
00:10:04,081 --> 00:10:05,370
you hate poor people.
And again,

203
00:10:05,371 --> 00:10:06,204
this seems like a parody,
but I have experienced this firsthand 

204
00:10:08,550 --> 00:10:10,580
plenty of time.
What have you do with that?

205
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:11,793
What do you do with that?
When you try to lay out something and 

206
00:10:14,641 --> 00:10:15,061
you say,
well,

207
00:10:15,061 --> 00:10:18,930
here's data to support it,
but it's so emotional to somebody else.

208
00:10:18,931 --> 00:10:19,764
Something like minimum wage or you 
usually I try to connect it to versed 

209
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:24,690
and experienced because the only time I 
talk about,

210
00:10:24,700 --> 00:10:25,291
uh,
uh,

211
00:10:25,291 --> 00:10:27,180
talking about the data,
then someone could say,

212
00:10:27,181 --> 00:10:28,140
well,
it's your data.

213
00:10:28,140 --> 00:10:28,973
Like how do I do?
There must be plenty of other people 

214
00:10:29,851 --> 00:10:31,830
have other data.
So trying to say,

215
00:10:31,831 --> 00:10:34,230
well look,
when you fill out a job application,

216
00:10:34,231 --> 00:10:35,850
you get to the line on salary 
requirements.

217
00:10:35,851 --> 00:10:37,990
You put a million dollars an hour.
No,

218
00:10:38,190 --> 00:10:39,900
why not?
Well,

219
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:41,750
because,
uh,

220
00:10:41,790 --> 00:10:44,430
I think if I put too much money then I'm
less likely to get the job.

221
00:10:44,460 --> 00:10:45,293
Ah Ha.
So it's not just me that believes that 

222
00:10:47,971 --> 00:10:50,430
if wages are too high,
that unemployment result,

223
00:10:50,460 --> 00:10:54,090
you believe it too.
It's just that you don't want to connect

224
00:10:54,091 --> 00:10:54,924
what you know from your own experience 
to the world of policy because it 

225
00:10:57,661 --> 00:10:58,790
doesn't sound good.
Yeah.

226
00:10:58,860 --> 00:11:00,720
I think it's interesting what you said 
about your parents.

227
00:11:00,721 --> 00:11:01,554
They had a rental property so they 
didn't like rent control because 

228
00:11:03,841 --> 00:11:07,150
obviously you don't want it if you're 
the owner of the property and how we,

229
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:08,033
how we all apply our own life might be 
separate from what our philosophical 

230
00:11:12,601 --> 00:11:13,090
principles are.

231
00:11:13,090 --> 00:11:13,923
Yeah.
Because I lived in New York City for 

232
00:11:15,271 --> 00:11:18,630
about 12 years in an apartment that was 
rent stabilized,

233
00:11:18,631 --> 00:11:20,340
so it's slightly different than right.
Controlled,

234
00:11:20,580 --> 00:11:23,010
but they could only increase my rent.
I think something like,

235
00:11:23,410 --> 00:11:24,720
you know,
would change every few years,

236
00:11:24,721 --> 00:11:28,980
but about two percent a year,
which for me as the tenant was great and

237
00:11:28,981 --> 00:11:29,670
they,
you know,

238
00:11:29,670 --> 00:11:33,360
over the course of 12 years,
my rent when I started at 1650 for a two

239
00:11:33,361 --> 00:11:37,560
bedroom apartment on the upper west and 
I think it maxed out at about 2000.

240
00:11:38,340 --> 00:11:41,040
So as the tenant on my side,
that's pretty great.

241
00:11:41,070 --> 00:11:42,870
Make the argument why I'm wrong about 
that.

242
00:11:43,350 --> 00:11:44,310
Yes.
Uh,

243
00:11:44,311 --> 00:11:46,420
so in terms of your own self interest,
you might,

244
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:48,230
might be perfectly right.
I mean they're,

245
00:11:48,231 --> 00:11:50,070
I mean I would say,
well there are some downsides.

246
00:11:50,071 --> 00:11:52,500
Things like quality tends to go down 
with rent control,

247
00:11:52,740 --> 00:11:53,573
so know like the heating,
the heating breaks down and you can 

248
00:11:55,260 --> 00:11:57,090
never fix a couple things.

249
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:58,750
So,
so there is that,

250
00:11:58,770 --> 00:11:59,301
uh,
so you know,

251
00:11:59,301 --> 00:12:00,011
this,
this is just,

252
00:12:00,011 --> 00:12:00,844
you know,
very standard result with any kind of 

253
00:12:01,541 --> 00:12:02,374
price controls.
If you can't adjust on the price then 

254
00:12:04,121 --> 00:12:07,730
you can adjust on all these other and 
all these other ways to adjust unquality

255
00:12:08,140 --> 00:12:11,080
a bot or are you going to,
you can try charging people for extras,

256
00:12:11,081 --> 00:12:12,400
things like that.
But yeah,

257
00:12:12,401 --> 00:12:13,300
I mean,
so like you know,

258
00:12:13,301 --> 00:12:14,134
there's always going to be people who do
benefit from the policies and if you 

259
00:12:16,211 --> 00:12:20,730
happen to be that person then it's very 
elegant.

260
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:21,573
Like you might say it hard to know the 
saving grace is that in general people 

261
00:12:24,941 --> 00:12:25,774
are not comfortable arguing for 
political policy or policies on self 

262
00:12:29,111 --> 00:12:30,550
hearsay.
The grounds some,

263
00:12:30,551 --> 00:12:31,480
you know,
when you were saying,

264
00:12:31,481 --> 00:12:32,640
look,
this is very bad for society.

265
00:12:32,650 --> 00:12:35,170
People normally want to dispute that 
that is bad for society.

266
00:12:35,350 --> 00:12:37,120
They don't want to say,
well sure it's bad for society,

267
00:12:37,121 --> 00:12:39,850
but I'm one of them in the minority of 
people are benefiting from this,

268
00:12:39,851 --> 00:12:41,500
so I like it and we should have it.

269
00:12:41,660 --> 00:12:42,291
Yeah,
you know,

270
00:12:42,291 --> 00:12:43,124
it's interesting.
I think the point that you make there 

271
00:12:44,331 --> 00:12:45,164
about,
well they're going to have to cut in 

272
00:12:45,741 --> 00:12:47,540
other ways if they can't raise your 
rent.

273
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:49,400
So for example,
in my building in the winter,

274
00:12:49,490 --> 00:12:52,090
every winter there would literally be,
if,

275
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:52,953
if we were in the middle of a storm,
there would be three or four days in a 

276
00:12:54,531 --> 00:12:56,810
row where we would not have heat.
It was an old steam heat,

277
00:12:57,320 --> 00:12:58,153
four story building and there was a 
couple days when I was single back then 

278
00:13:01,161 --> 00:13:04,730
that I literally was under the covers 
with my dog because I didn't want her to

279
00:13:04,731 --> 00:13:08,480
freeze either and I went to the,
to the management building,

280
00:13:08,481 --> 00:13:09,314
which is a couple blocks away and I was 
basically reaming them out and I 

281
00:13:12,470 --> 00:13:13,303
remember the woman was sitting behind 
bulletproof glass and this is what's 

282
00:13:17,331 --> 00:13:18,950
wrong with this system.
This woman,

283
00:13:19,070 --> 00:13:19,903
she works for a big company,
they own 500 buildings were stuck under 

284
00:13:23,061 --> 00:13:23,894
this.
I never fully connected that to rent 

285
00:13:26,510 --> 00:13:29,470
control or rent stabilization,
not inclined to move out to a full plate

286
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:31,400
price place that had good heat.
Yeah.

287
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:34,690
So that does show how we all sort of 
negotiate these strange things.

288
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:37,460
So let's talk about a narco capitalist.
All right?

289
00:13:37,461 --> 00:13:38,294
Because I haven't done much on it.
I think I've had one in Norco 

290
00:13:40,521 --> 00:13:43,250
capitalist,
my friend that guy t on on youtube.

291
00:13:43,300 --> 00:13:44,390
You should check out if you don't know 
him.

292
00:13:44,391 --> 00:13:46,340
Great guy in Atlanta.
Um,

293
00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:48,320
what is a narco capitalism.

294
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:49,120
So enter.
Oh,

295
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:49,953
capitalism is the idea that these so 
called minimal functions to the states 

296
00:13:53,111 --> 00:13:56,730
are actually more than you really need.
And it's,

297
00:13:56,880 --> 00:14:00,190
it is not only imaginable butts,
you know,

298
00:14:00,290 --> 00:14:01,123
it could,
but it really could work to prioritize 

299
00:14:02,851 --> 00:14:03,684
the last lingering functions of 
government like police courts and the 

300
00:14:06,721 --> 00:14:08,220
law itself.
And this is it.

301
00:14:08,250 --> 00:14:09,083
This sounds really crazy.
So the way that I usually like to 

302
00:14:10,231 --> 00:14:11,430
explain it is,
well,

303
00:14:11,431 --> 00:14:13,860
right now people may say,
well government clearly sms,

304
00:14:13,861 --> 00:14:15,300
monopoly over police,
monopoly,

305
00:14:15,301 --> 00:14:17,460
overclock over courts,
monopoly over law,

306
00:14:17,630 --> 00:14:20,340
and I say government has a monopoly over
these things right now.

307
00:14:20,820 --> 00:14:23,760
Right now there's actually more private 
security guards and police.

308
00:14:24,420 --> 00:14:26,730
So is that.
That's true.

309
00:14:26,731 --> 00:14:27,564
So you know there are,
there are more people hired by business 

310
00:14:30,451 --> 00:14:34,250
and communities to go and do policing.
Then there are police in the,

311
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:35,790
in the official sense.

312
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:36,953
And then you know.
So for courts there is a huge area of 

313
00:14:39,451 --> 00:14:41,550
private adjudication.
There's arbitration,

314
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:43,470
there is anytime you have a problem with
your credit card,

315
00:14:43,471 --> 00:14:45,120
do you sue the company?
This involved?

316
00:14:45,121 --> 00:14:45,954
No.
You called the credit card company and 

317
00:14:46,471 --> 00:14:47,304
they have their own internal 
adjudication system for handling things 

318
00:14:49,951 --> 00:14:53,480
like this on facebook.
If you have problems on facebook,

319
00:14:53,690 --> 00:14:55,130
do you go into facebook?
No.

320
00:14:55,131 --> 00:14:56,090
You Go,
you go and you,

321
00:14:56,190 --> 00:14:58,130
when you complain with them and they do 
something about it,

322
00:14:58,490 --> 00:14:59,323
and then essentially they really do 
something about it in the case of 

323
00:15:01,101 --> 00:15:02,940
facebook,
but maybe we'll say,

324
00:15:02,941 --> 00:15:03,771
well,
it's the minimum.

325
00:15:03,771 --> 00:15:05,750
They give you a bunch of options to 
solve your own problem.

326
00:15:05,751 --> 00:15:07,490
You can block someone,
you can unfriend them,

327
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:09,650
you can make sure that they never 
contact you again.

328
00:15:09,651 --> 00:15:10,484
So you know,
they give you a bunch of remedies that 

329
00:15:12,051 --> 00:15:13,520
you have,
which are,

330
00:15:13,521 --> 00:15:14,354
you know,
they've worked out exactly what it is 

331
00:15:15,201 --> 00:15:16,160
they want to do about it.

332
00:15:16,510 --> 00:15:16,970
And then,
you know,

333
00:15:16,970 --> 00:15:19,550
similarly for your,
for learning a lot self,

334
00:15:19,551 --> 00:15:20,384
there are many private organizations 
that have their own rules that they 

335
00:15:22,941 --> 00:15:24,080
apply.
So again,

336
00:15:24,081 --> 00:15:26,840
mentioning I'll be up.
So private arbitration,

337
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:27,993
you know,
one of the main reasons people use 

338
00:15:28,581 --> 00:15:31,100
private arbitration is that they don't 
use regular laws.

339
00:15:31,370 --> 00:15:32,203
They use their own laws which are 
designed to work better than the 

340
00:15:34,161 --> 00:15:34,994
government's law so that you can get 
your issue resolved in a few days 

341
00:15:37,191 --> 00:15:39,350
instead of weeks or years.
Uh,

342
00:15:39,351 --> 00:15:39,801
so,
you know,

343
00:15:39,801 --> 00:15:42,290
like usually with a pro,
with private arbitration,

344
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:43,393
they have the arbitrator.
Actually be someone who knows what he's 

345
00:15:44,631 --> 00:15:45,464
doing,
so they have someone who is in fact an 

346
00:15:47,211 --> 00:15:48,044
expert on this area of business ceos 
rather than giving it to a generalist 

347
00:15:52,251 --> 00:15:53,084
and 12 people who were,
who were too dumb to get out of jury 

348
00:15:54,861 --> 00:15:55,960
duty.
Uh,

349
00:15:56,030 --> 00:15:57,800
so just,
just sort of beginning realizing,

350
00:15:57,801 --> 00:15:58,050
wow,
this.

351
00:15:58,050 --> 00:15:58,883
So there's a lot of private,
more private alternatives that already 

352
00:16:01,851 --> 00:16:04,680
exists right now to,
you know,

353
00:16:04,690 --> 00:16:07,550
to government providing these services 
that at first glance,

354
00:16:07,551 --> 00:16:09,590
a lot of people just have the reaction 
of it with justice society,

355
00:16:09,591 --> 00:16:10,424
which is burned in flames.
If there were private police or private 

356
00:16:13,311 --> 00:16:16,220
cloud or private courts are private law.
Look around.

357
00:16:16,221 --> 00:16:17,054
It's not burning now and there's already
a very large role for the private 

358
00:16:19,461 --> 00:16:20,660
sector.
So.

359
00:16:20,661 --> 00:16:21,510
And then we will.
What I think,

360
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:22,353
you know,
what I think about anarcho capitalist 

361
00:16:22,991 --> 00:16:23,930
and I always just say,
all right,

362
00:16:23,931 --> 00:16:24,764
well let's start when we got you realize
that that is not going to lead anything 

363
00:16:27,471 --> 00:16:29,480
bad.
And there's very good reasons why people

364
00:16:29,481 --> 00:16:31,010
are using these private alternatives 
right now,

365
00:16:31,011 --> 00:16:34,490
which is they're better,
they're worth the money you get,

366
00:16:34,491 --> 00:16:35,480
you know,
you actually get a,

367
00:16:35,481 --> 00:16:37,970
you get a better quality for all four 
of,

368
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,140
you know,
not only for a lower price,

369
00:16:39,141 --> 00:16:39,974
but remember,
these are private companies competing 

370
00:16:41,841 --> 00:16:42,674
with free government services and 
they're still carving out a big market 

371
00:16:45,011 --> 00:16:45,844
niche for themselves because so many 
people are so dissatisfied with these 

372
00:16:48,991 --> 00:16:49,824
services,
they get provided free by the 

373
00:16:50,511 --> 00:16:51,344
government.

374
00:16:51,410 --> 00:16:54,140
And then just thinking about like,
how much further can we take these?

375
00:16:54,530 --> 00:16:55,780
So,
you know,

376
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:56,910
very easy with,
with,

377
00:16:56,920 --> 00:16:58,130
uh,
with private arbitration,

378
00:16:58,131 --> 00:16:58,964
right now,
one of the big limits on private 

379
00:17:00,261 --> 00:17:04,550
arbitration is that even if you sign a 
so called binding arbitration clause,

380
00:17:04,850 --> 00:17:05,920
in fact,
if the,

381
00:17:05,930 --> 00:17:07,520
uh,
have the person that is,

382
00:17:07,940 --> 00:17:10,310
if a person doesn't like how the binding
arbitration turns out,

383
00:17:10,670 --> 00:17:12,540
they can go and they can,
yes,

384
00:17:13,080 --> 00:17:15,050
they can take it works.
So for example,

385
00:17:15,051 --> 00:17:17,240
if you sighing binding arbitration 
saying,

386
00:17:17,690 --> 00:17:21,020
know in the event of any of any 
employment to dispute,

387
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:22,113
it's going to,
this will be handled by private 

388
00:17:22,941 --> 00:17:24,230
arbitration.
Uh,

389
00:17:24,260 --> 00:17:26,960
you know,
like that contract in general isn't like

390
00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:29,390
while it might get a forced,
there's no,

391
00:17:29,391 --> 00:17:31,760
there's no confidence that would be.
And again,

392
00:17:31,761 --> 00:17:33,290
if you think about it,
well yeah,

393
00:17:33,291 --> 00:17:35,630
I mean like suppose that you could sign 
this binding arbitration.

394
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:38,960
I could get my brother in law to go and 
be the arbitrator.

395
00:17:38,961 --> 00:17:42,140
He always rules in my favor.
You could use this to get around a great

396
00:17:42,141 --> 00:17:42,974
many government laws so you can 
understand why government doesn't want 

397
00:17:45,201 --> 00:17:46,034
to do this and yet clearly you could go 
and allow a lot more room for private 

398
00:17:49,921 --> 00:17:51,310
arbitration and,
and I,

399
00:17:51,370 --> 00:17:54,150
and actually it is likely that there is 
immense,

400
00:17:54,300 --> 00:17:55,133
immense pent up demand for private 
arbitration that is right now being 

401
00:17:57,121 --> 00:17:59,040
stifled by regulation.
Right.

402
00:17:59,041 --> 00:17:59,874
And then Uln,
once you start thinking about how could 

403
00:18:01,381 --> 00:18:02,430
there be even more ideal,
you know,

404
00:18:02,431 --> 00:18:03,264
so like one,
like one obvious one to me is you go 

405
00:18:05,731 --> 00:18:09,060
into government courts and they say,
well actually if this,

406
00:18:09,090 --> 00:18:12,200
if this is a private contract,
we just just required,

407
00:18:12,201 --> 00:18:14,700
you just have to have an arbitration 
clause and it's not our problem,

408
00:18:14,710 --> 00:18:15,870
you know,
so like,

409
00:18:15,871 --> 00:18:16,950
no,
they're like you're so if you want,

410
00:18:16,970 --> 00:18:19,050
if you want adjudication,
put an arbitration clause.

411
00:18:19,050 --> 00:18:19,883
And all we do,
there's this butte is so it's the 

412
00:18:21,681 --> 00:18:24,360
contract that says this is the 
arbitrator rubber stamp.

413
00:18:24,390 --> 00:18:25,223
That's it.
Yeah.

414
00:18:25,260 --> 00:18:26,093
So maybe as an intermediate,
intermediate step you would keep 

415
00:18:29,340 --> 00:18:31,970
criminal stuff exact.
Exactly.

416
00:18:32,510 --> 00:18:33,343
Exactly.
Move some of this stuff that's purely 

417
00:18:34,511 --> 00:18:36,440
mentally bay.
Exactly.

418
00:18:36,650 --> 00:18:37,483
So then when you just start thinking 
about all the things that you can hand 

419
00:18:40,141 --> 00:18:41,790
over to the private sector to the 
private sector,

420
00:18:41,990 --> 00:18:42,823
you know,
it is much larger than what pf and went 

421
00:18:44,491 --> 00:18:46,350
through the what,
what occurs the first.

422
00:18:46,351 --> 00:18:50,190
And then the anarcho capitalist idea is 
really once we,

423
00:18:50,191 --> 00:18:51,024
once we have privatized all the things 
that at first it seemed like you 

424
00:18:54,781 --> 00:18:55,614
couldn't,
but we just keep going further and 

425
00:18:56,221 --> 00:18:59,010
further and further the end.
You're left with almost nothing.

426
00:18:59,460 --> 00:19:00,293
And then the question is,
could you just get rid of that last 

427
00:19:01,951 --> 00:19:02,970
bit's.
So let's,

428
00:19:03,110 --> 00:19:03,943
let's pause on the left side for a 
second because you mentioned a few 

429
00:19:05,851 --> 00:19:06,600
different areas there.

430
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:08,430
So I think the arbitration one's really 
interesting.

431
00:19:08,550 --> 00:19:11,760
I'm wondering when you see cases of 
arbitration now,

432
00:19:12,030 --> 00:19:12,863
uh,
it must self select a certain type of 

433
00:19:14,671 --> 00:19:15,504
person to go ahead and do that.
What type of things are being fought in 

434
00:19:18,271 --> 00:19:19,470
arbitration?
You know what I mean?

435
00:19:19,471 --> 00:19:20,304
Like you'd have,
I guess you'd probably have to have a 

436
00:19:21,541 --> 00:19:22,374
certain amount of money you would not 
want to maybe know that the person 

437
00:19:24,271 --> 00:19:25,104
across the table from you is in a 
similar situation or has similar views 

438
00:19:27,931 --> 00:19:28,764
that they'd be willing to accept it 
because you just said right at the end 

439
00:19:31,231 --> 00:19:33,880
they could probably figure out a way to 
get this back into the courts.

440
00:19:33,900 --> 00:19:35,190
I mean,
it's fairly common actually.

441
00:19:35,191 --> 00:19:38,490
Just add it in as boiler plate into a 
contract saying it will be arbitrated,

442
00:19:38,491 --> 00:19:40,380
but the people who really wanted I 
think,

443
00:19:40,381 --> 00:19:42,480
or people have been burned by lawsuits 
in the past,

444
00:19:42,750 --> 00:19:43,583
people who've seen business deals as 
collapsed before their eyes because the 

445
00:19:46,141 --> 00:19:46,974
dispute came up and they didn't work it 
out and then it took years for them to 

446
00:19:49,861 --> 00:19:50,550
go and resolve it.

447
00:19:50,550 --> 00:19:55,170
And by then the business was bankrupt.
So the OCR or course if you've been sued

448
00:19:55,171 --> 00:19:57,900
by an employee and you think you and I 
didn't even think it was bogus.

449
00:19:57,901 --> 00:20:00,510
That's another thing.
Like I never want that to happen again.

450
00:20:00,930 --> 00:20:01,763
So these are the,
like some obvious cases and putting it 

451
00:20:03,541 --> 00:20:04,790
in.
But you know,

452
00:20:04,870 --> 00:20:07,740
chorusy like no employer is thrilled 
about the idea of getting sued.

453
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:11,700
So like yelling and like if it were the 
kind of thing that you could really rely

454
00:20:11,701 --> 00:20:12,910
on,
then you know,

455
00:20:12,940 --> 00:20:16,590
I say I think it's very likely that it 
would be like totally standard to put in

456
00:20:16,591 --> 00:20:17,424
private arbitration and just to avoid or
like all like all the hassles that are 

457
00:20:20,401 --> 00:20:22,960
involved with hiring people right now.
Um,

458
00:20:23,260 --> 00:20:23,851
you know,
of course,

459
00:20:23,851 --> 00:20:26,370
if you think these laws are good,
then this is very distressing to you.

460
00:20:26,371 --> 00:20:28,830
On the other hand,
to someone like me,

461
00:20:28,831 --> 00:20:29,664
the fact that almost everyone would 
probably happily sign away the right to 

462
00:20:32,221 --> 00:20:34,610
sue their employer shows there's 
something very curt,

463
00:20:34,611 --> 00:20:35,870
very bad about the system we have.

464
00:20:35,870 --> 00:20:36,660
It's like,
look,

465
00:20:36,660 --> 00:20:39,380
it's the kind of thing that you have the
right to sue employers.

466
00:20:39,390 --> 00:20:40,223
That kind of right.
The people will sign away for a small 

467
00:20:41,281 --> 00:20:42,114
amount of money,
which means that it's probably not a 

468
00:20:43,591 --> 00:20:46,350
very valuable right to begin with.
It's the kind of thing that you're stuck

469
00:20:46,351 --> 00:20:50,560
with and it's in so many ways it's a 
burden because then you have to convince

470
00:20:50,561 --> 00:20:51,910
an employer,
I'm not going to sue you.

471
00:20:51,911 --> 00:20:52,810
I'm,
I'm cool.

472
00:20:52,990 --> 00:20:53,823
And well,
isn't it also that the average person 

473
00:20:54,851 --> 00:20:57,790
who works for even a small company,
not just a giant corporation,

474
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:01,270
we don't have lawyers on retainer.
So I work for myself now,

475
00:21:01,271 --> 00:21:02,104
which is a pretty beautiful thing,
but I've worked at plenty of companies 

476
00:21:04,121 --> 00:21:04,954
where the day I got hired I had to sign 
some crazy book of all the pressure and 

477
00:21:08,830 --> 00:21:10,420
of course I didn't read all that stuff.

478
00:21:10,530 --> 00:21:13,070
So it's like I'm not walking around with
our lawyer and most people are.

479
00:21:13,210 --> 00:21:14,043
So many people are just signing stuff 
without even knowing what they're 

480
00:21:15,371 --> 00:21:16,204
saying.
Which I would say is thank goodness for 

481
00:21:18,251 --> 00:21:19,084
that because if people were actually,
people are actually taking it more 

482
00:21:22,331 --> 00:21:24,580
seriously and you'll see where you are 
right now.

483
00:21:24,581 --> 00:21:24,910
I think,
you know,

484
00:21:24,910 --> 00:21:29,910
firms are taking advantage of that to 
get to go and diluted as much as the law

485
00:21:30,041 --> 00:21:31,240
will allow.
And again,

486
00:21:31,241 --> 00:21:32,074
I think there's a sense.
I think the regulations are bad in the 

487
00:21:33,281 --> 00:21:34,114
first place.
I'm all for people diluting the 

488
00:21:36,071 --> 00:21:39,250
regulations as much as possible.
So there's an old saying,

489
00:21:39,251 --> 00:21:41,100
thank God we don't get as much 
government to be paid for.

490
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:42,133
I say also,
thank God we don't sue people to 

491
00:21:43,781 --> 00:21:44,614
anywhere near the extent that we legally
could because it would be a hellish 

492
00:21:47,171 --> 00:21:48,030
world.
Yeah.

493
00:21:48,270 --> 00:21:49,810
This may sound like a very amateur 
question,

494
00:21:49,811 --> 00:21:53,890
but when people go into arbitration,
are you bringing a lawyer with you or is

495
00:21:53,891 --> 00:21:57,730
it just that the arbitrator is just 
looking at what was signed and deciding?

496
00:21:57,760 --> 00:21:59,680
Like is there an actual argument that's 
taking place?

497
00:21:59,860 --> 00:22:03,910
So I think it varies a lot so sometimes 
you might bring a lawyer so you know,

498
00:22:03,911 --> 00:22:05,800
so we'd like.
It may actually depend upon the rules of

499
00:22:05,801 --> 00:22:07,220
the arbitration,
but you know,

500
00:22:07,290 --> 00:22:09,840
I think a lot of the ideas just to cut 
the expenses down so the.

501
00:22:09,850 --> 00:22:10,683
A lot of times you don't have a lawyer,
you just have an arbitrator there who 

502
00:22:13,061 --> 00:22:13,894
generally is well versed in the industry
that you're working in so he actually 

503
00:22:17,651 --> 00:22:20,530
knows what you're talking about.
And then of course you know part of what

504
00:22:20,531 --> 00:22:21,364
they're doing.
So there's something more moderate 

505
00:22:21,911 --> 00:22:22,744
called mediation where the arbitrator 
doesn't matter where the person doesn't 

506
00:22:24,911 --> 00:22:28,390
really get to decide anything but just 
tries to get the two people to talk.

507
00:22:28,391 --> 00:22:31,810
It's kind of like counseling and then 
arbitration is stronger where he listens

508
00:22:31,811 --> 00:22:33,670
to both sides and then he tells you 
about what's going to be.

509
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:37,300
Is there a set time frame on how long 
that lasts?

510
00:22:37,320 --> 00:22:37,880
No,
no.

511
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:39,610
Certainly not always a.
Since this is private,

512
00:22:39,650 --> 00:22:40,930
there's,
you know,

513
00:22:41,350 --> 00:22:42,183
there's a wide range.
There's a beautiful rainbow of all 

514
00:22:44,261 --> 00:22:46,120
possibilities so we know which are all 
done.

515
00:22:46,121 --> 00:22:47,290
So you know,
there's,

516
00:22:47,291 --> 00:22:49,540
you know,
sometimes there's an arbitrator who just

517
00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:51,850
says looking at like we need tomorrow.
That's it Robert.

518
00:22:51,980 --> 00:22:53,830
And that story,
here's what's gonna happen.

519
00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:58,360
And even part of the beauty of that is 
once you get the dispute resolved,

520
00:22:58,510 --> 00:23:00,310
a lot of times you can go back to 
working with each other.

521
00:23:00,670 --> 00:23:01,503
We may not be that happy about it,
but it's like there's no longer an 

522
00:23:03,371 --> 00:23:06,520
ongoing dispute and so it's settled and 
then he can get back to business and you

523
00:23:06,521 --> 00:23:08,620
haven't paid and insane amount to 
lawyers.

524
00:23:09,430 --> 00:23:11,290
Lawyers aren't thrilled with the.
Yeah,

525
00:23:11,291 --> 00:23:12,420
yeah.
Probably not immediately.

526
00:23:12,430 --> 00:23:14,410
So of course their sob who are 
entrepreneurial enough to see,

527
00:23:14,411 --> 00:23:16,360
well this is an opportunity for me to 
branch out,

528
00:23:16,750 --> 00:23:18,490
but yeah,
I think it would be very bad for lawyers

529
00:23:18,491 --> 00:23:19,300
in the,
in the long running.

530
00:23:19,300 --> 00:23:21,190
And of course,
for litigators particularly,

531
00:23:21,191 --> 00:23:23,350
which is a small minority of lawyers in 
the first place,

532
00:23:23,351 --> 00:23:25,420
but uh,
you know,

533
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:26,273
assuming like,
you know,

534
00:23:26,290 --> 00:23:27,123
like for a contract lawyer,
this might be awesome because then 

535
00:23:28,721 --> 00:23:29,554
people,
then there'd be a bunch of people who 

536
00:23:30,791 --> 00:23:31,624
want to rewrite all their contracts to 
go and putting by putting binding 

537
00:23:33,581 --> 00:23:35,890
arbitration that's truly and utterly 
binding.

538
00:23:35,980 --> 00:23:37,510
Right.
Uh,

539
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:41,740
so you mentioned earlier that even 
policing could be pressurized,

540
00:23:41,950 --> 00:23:42,783
but what would happen?
So I can understand that a place like 

541
00:23:44,291 --> 00:23:45,124
beverly hills people got a lot of money.
We're going to prioritize the Beverly 

542
00:23:49,190 --> 00:23:50,023
Hills Police Department.
Beverly Hills Cop.

543
00:23:50,040 --> 00:23:50,873
Okay.
I saw the movie that wasn't what the 

544
00:23:52,310 --> 00:23:54,980
movie was about,
but I had to get that in there somehow.

545
00:23:55,190 --> 00:23:57,480
But what wasn't a place?
What about in a place where they're at,

546
00:23:57,481 --> 00:23:59,480
where the economics are terrible,
where people have no money,

547
00:23:59,540 --> 00:24:01,160
we're probably crime is the highest.

548
00:24:01,160 --> 00:24:02,930
Who,
who's going to put in money to.

549
00:24:02,990 --> 00:24:04,160
How are you gonna make a profit off 
that.

550
00:24:04,310 --> 00:24:05,090
Yeah.
So,

551
00:24:05,090 --> 00:24:05,711
um,
you know,

552
00:24:05,711 --> 00:24:06,290
keeping,
you realize.

553
00:24:06,290 --> 00:24:07,123
So those places work where crime is 
terrible or ones where the current 

554
00:24:08,811 --> 00:24:11,710
police already don't work very well.
So we're just,

555
00:24:11,711 --> 00:24:12,544
we're stepping back and realizing the 
current system is quite grumpy to begin 

556
00:24:14,481 --> 00:24:15,650
with now.
Like you know,

557
00:24:15,651 --> 00:24:17,030
who would pay for it otherwise.
So again,

558
00:24:17,060 --> 00:24:19,850
the obvious place to start are people 
actually are landlords.

559
00:24:20,340 --> 00:24:21,173
So like in a more suburban area,
you're talking about homeowners 

560
00:24:23,411 --> 00:24:25,910
associations are some of the obvious 
people to pay for it,

561
00:24:26,270 --> 00:24:28,430
but you know,
even now in that area is very common for

562
00:24:28,431 --> 00:24:30,230
landlords to pay for some kind of 
security.

563
00:24:30,260 --> 00:24:35,260
And if they know that it's their job to 
do it in a high crime area,

564
00:24:35,401 --> 00:24:36,234
you'll even someone who is poor is 
galliano values their life values 

565
00:24:38,961 --> 00:24:39,440
protection.

566
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:40,910
So you know,
like sort of like a,

567
00:24:40,911 --> 00:24:42,590
like an economist joke has been like,
you know,

568
00:24:42,591 --> 00:24:45,350
you see a lot of really expensive 
sneakers and bad areas down,

569
00:24:45,710 --> 00:24:48,500
but why is this?
Well like when it's a priority,

570
00:24:48,501 --> 00:24:51,410
people will come up with the money in 
order to pay for things that they really

571
00:24:51,411 --> 00:24:53,270
care about.
But you know,

572
00:24:53,271 --> 00:24:55,430
the other thing about policing is,
I mean I think it's also better to think

573
00:24:55,431 --> 00:24:58,400
about it and in a broader category of 
just enforcement of all kinds.

574
00:24:58,760 --> 00:25:01,550
So there's many kinds of enforcement 
besides actual police.

575
00:25:01,551 --> 00:25:02,384
So one that's become very common with 
the Internet is the all kinds of 

576
00:25:06,741 --> 00:25:09,140
reputational incentives.
So you know,

577
00:25:09,141 --> 00:25:09,560
like,
you know,

578
00:25:09,560 --> 00:25:11,600
just like bad reviews,
things like this,

579
00:25:11,601 --> 00:25:14,210
you know,
these work far better than like the FDA.

580
00:25:14,211 --> 00:25:15,044
So you like imagine you get a bad meal,
do you go and call it the FDA and 

581
00:25:17,491 --> 00:25:20,750
complain about it or something like that
or like local meat inspectors know,

582
00:25:20,751 --> 00:25:23,450
like much more likely to go and put in a
bad yelp review.

583
00:25:23,450 --> 00:25:27,690
And this is the way that we are probably
getting most of our actual enforcements.

584
00:25:27,970 --> 00:25:29,030
You know,
like you like how,

585
00:25:29,031 --> 00:25:30,530
what is protecting you from food 
poisoning?

586
00:25:30,531 --> 00:25:31,364
Is it the government now?
The government's hardly doing anything 

587
00:25:33,261 --> 00:25:34,094
about it.
What's really protecting you from food 

588
00:25:34,551 --> 00:25:35,384
poisoning is always word of mouth,
which is now amplified because there's 

589
00:25:38,481 --> 00:25:39,980
no.
Now it is word of the Internet.

590
00:25:39,981 --> 00:25:41,420
One,
one complaints.

591
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:43,520
So you're like,
my dad runs an internet business,

592
00:25:43,521 --> 00:25:44,354
like one disgruntled customer is 
terrible for you and is really a much 

593
00:25:47,781 --> 00:25:50,840
more effective enforcement mechanism 
than anything in the government is doing

594
00:25:50,841 --> 00:25:53,030
about it.
So some of it that it just,

595
00:25:53,150 --> 00:25:57,830
the messaging has to be clear because 
that concept seems very obvious to me in

596
00:25:57,831 --> 00:25:59,840
a day of the Internet where you're 
right,

597
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:00,913
people care now more about what a yelp 
review of a restaurant says than what 

598
00:26:04,821 --> 00:26:08,050
either a written review in the La Times 
says or what,

599
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:08,913
uh,
you know,

600
00:26:09,060 --> 00:26:11,510
what it says at the restaurant,
what they're telling you themselves.

601
00:26:11,750 --> 00:26:14,540
So we,
that this is really about messaging in a

602
00:26:14,541 --> 00:26:17,600
way more than economics because I think 
people can get there economically.

603
00:26:17,870 --> 00:26:18,480
Yeah.
Yeah.

604
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:23,330
And then again also just thinking about 
ways that you can get a contract between

605
00:26:23,331 --> 00:26:25,890
people that you don't ordinarily think 
of as a,

606
00:26:25,980 --> 00:26:29,330
as a contractual relationship.
So right now we also like,

607
00:26:29,331 --> 00:26:31,220
if you get an accident with someone 
you'd only car accident.

608
00:26:31,221 --> 00:26:32,054
You don't have,
you don't have a contract with the 

609
00:26:32,601 --> 00:26:35,210
person who got an accident with.
But if you both have insurance,

610
00:26:35,211 --> 00:26:36,044
your insurance company has a 
relationship with their insurance 

611
00:26:37,701 --> 00:26:38,800
company.
So when,

612
00:26:38,801 --> 00:26:39,201
you know,
of course,

613
00:26:39,201 --> 00:26:40,034
most auto accidents never go to trial.
The insurance companies have a system 

614
00:26:43,140 --> 00:26:45,270
that they work out where they negotiate 
with each other,

615
00:26:45,271 --> 00:26:46,920
they've got standards.
So again,

616
00:26:46,921 --> 00:26:48,330
that's,
that's already going on.

617
00:26:48,540 --> 00:26:50,760
And then just think about anytime you're
in a public place,

618
00:26:50,761 --> 00:26:53,140
anytime you're in a mall,
so you,

619
00:26:53,141 --> 00:26:54,750
like you are right now,
of course,

620
00:26:54,751 --> 00:26:56,380
if there's a dispute there,
the police will handle it.

621
00:26:56,400 --> 00:27:00,810
But it is very easy to visualize a world
where when you go to the mall,

622
00:27:00,811 --> 00:27:02,310
there's actually a sign saying like,
Yo,

623
00:27:02,340 --> 00:27:03,173
so when you enter this,
you come under the jurisdiction of this 

624
00:27:05,311 --> 00:27:06,144
arbitration company and Alice.
And then any dispute that happens in 

625
00:27:09,061 --> 00:27:12,570
them all then is no longer actually 
needs to be handled by the police.

626
00:27:13,040 --> 00:27:13,801
Uh,
so,

627
00:27:13,801 --> 00:27:14,221
you know,
so,

628
00:27:14,221 --> 00:27:15,054
you know,
and,

629
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:16,060
and of course people saying,
well,

630
00:27:16,061 --> 00:27:17,070
I mean,
they're just ran a cops,

631
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:17,731
you know,
they don't even have,

632
00:27:17,731 --> 00:27:19,230
a lot of them don't ever really have 
guns.

633
00:27:19,910 --> 00:27:20,743
I mean,
of course if the taxpayers will pay for 

634
00:27:22,411 --> 00:27:25,890
someone to be shot at than pe companies 
are not going to pay or not going to pay

635
00:27:25,891 --> 00:27:27,190
the extra amount to have their 
employees.

636
00:27:27,390 --> 00:27:30,330
So the whole system of economics,
we sort of flipped if we.

637
00:27:30,340 --> 00:27:31,410
Yeah.
Yeah.

638
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:32,790
So I mean,
you know,

639
00:27:33,090 --> 00:27:33,923
the amazing thing about all of the kinds
of private of private law that we see 

640
00:27:37,711 --> 00:27:40,170
right now,
isn't that how little it does,

641
00:27:40,171 --> 00:27:41,004
but how much it does given that the 
government provides these services free 

642
00:27:42,931 --> 00:27:43,764
of charge and people still,
I will take money out of their own 

643
00:27:46,201 --> 00:27:49,410
pockets to go rather than go and get the
free stuff.

644
00:27:49,770 --> 00:27:50,401
Which yeah.
All right.

645
00:27:50,401 --> 00:27:51,300
So you know,
of course,

646
00:27:51,301 --> 00:27:52,010
you know,
and so you know,

647
00:27:52,010 --> 00:27:52,843
it's always the incense,
it's not free because you have to pay 

648
00:27:53,611 --> 00:27:55,140
taxes,
but in another sense it is free.

649
00:27:55,141 --> 00:27:58,530
Namely you can use it without any 
additional charge.

650
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:00,540
So that's the sense in which this stuff 
is free.

651
00:28:00,700 --> 00:28:03,180
Like sometimes they'll like,
you'll get charged for a false alarm,

652
00:28:03,181 --> 00:28:04,014
although that's pretty unusual.
But like the fire departments sometimes 

653
00:28:06,210 --> 00:28:07,530
you call them for no reason.
They'll sit,

654
00:28:07,531 --> 00:28:09,020
they'll give you a,
a bales.

655
00:28:09,021 --> 00:28:09,854
I like,
why did you go and waste valuable 

656
00:28:11,011 --> 00:28:13,020
services?
But normally that's not how it works.

657
00:28:13,080 --> 00:28:13,913
You mentioned a car insurance.
Where does health insurance fall on 

658
00:28:16,860 --> 00:28:17,693
this?
Because how the Germans right now is 

659
00:28:18,331 --> 00:28:20,180
making everyone completely insane.
Uh,

660
00:28:20,520 --> 00:28:23,070
no matter what side you're on,
everyone is crazy about this.

661
00:28:23,071 --> 00:28:23,904
So,
so what is then the answer for health 

662
00:28:25,771 --> 00:28:26,604
insurance in your view?

663
00:28:26,670 --> 00:28:27,790
Right.
Uh,

664
00:28:27,810 --> 00:28:32,070
well I guess that's probably the last 
question I'll ask you for the interview.

665
00:28:33,330 --> 00:28:36,510
So no health insurance.
So you know,

666
00:28:36,511 --> 00:28:37,344
I like,
I have the extreme view that there's no 

667
00:28:38,551 --> 00:28:40,830
reason for government to be involved in 
this area at all.

668
00:28:41,220 --> 00:28:42,053
And what's very striking is that while 
most economists officially sell will 

669
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:47,460
disagree,
but when,

670
00:28:47,500 --> 00:28:48,333
when,
when I've actually got an argue with 

671
00:28:49,081 --> 00:28:51,030
them,
usually when they argue for regulation,

672
00:28:51,240 --> 00:28:53,880
they're arguing for regulations to fix 
other regulations.

673
00:28:54,090 --> 00:28:54,871
And when I say,
well,

674
00:28:54,871 --> 00:28:57,630
what if we just didn't have the first 
regulations are trying to fix,

675
00:28:57,900 --> 00:28:58,733
then the reaction is kind of like,
well I never really thought about it 

676
00:29:00,271 --> 00:29:02,610
that much.
So just for example,

677
00:29:02,680 --> 00:29:03,410
the,
you know,

678
00:29:03,410 --> 00:29:06,300
the whole idea of Obamacare,
is that all right?

679
00:29:06,301 --> 00:29:07,134
Well first we're going to have a 
regulation saying that you can't turn 

680
00:29:09,121 --> 00:29:11,150
people down for insurance.
And secondly,

681
00:29:11,151 --> 00:29:13,830
we're gonna have a regulation saying 
that you can't charge them higher prices

682
00:29:14,310 --> 00:29:16,700
and then people normally realize,
well,

683
00:29:16,701 --> 00:29:18,060
wait a second,
you a system like that,

684
00:29:18,061 --> 00:29:18,894
that a lot of people just wait around 
until they're sick and so then we're 

685
00:29:20,851 --> 00:29:22,650
going to require people to buy 
insurance,

686
00:29:22,920 --> 00:29:25,410
to avoid the problems created by the new
regulations.

687
00:29:25,740 --> 00:29:26,573
And then we're gonna.
Then there's people too poor to afford 

688
00:29:28,141 --> 00:29:28,974
it.
So then we're going to subsidize those 

689
00:29:29,551 --> 00:29:31,430
people to deal with the other three 
regulations.

690
00:29:31,730 --> 00:29:32,970
All right?
So,

691
00:29:33,270 --> 00:29:33,961
um,
you know,

692
00:29:33,961 --> 00:29:34,794
my view is there's really no reason why 
you couldn't have scrapped all the 

693
00:29:36,811 --> 00:29:37,950
regulation and just said,
look,

694
00:29:37,951 --> 00:29:40,980
here's your incentive by insurance.
If you wait until you're sick,

695
00:29:40,990 --> 00:29:41,823
you won't be able to afford it.
But then what do you do for those 

696
00:29:44,051 --> 00:29:44,441
people?
So,

697
00:29:44,441 --> 00:29:47,230
so I guess I get that,
but isn't,

698
00:29:47,300 --> 00:29:50,590
than what,
what happens as a result of that is that

699
00:29:50,650 --> 00:29:51,483
x amount of people,
and it's going to be a lot of people 

700
00:29:52,631 --> 00:29:53,464
simply will not do it because they'd 
rather spend their money elsewhere and 

701
00:29:56,741 --> 00:29:59,980
hope that there'll be healthy or,
or they'll just get a broken leg playing

702
00:29:59,981 --> 00:30:01,450
basketball or something else or 
whatever.

703
00:30:01,610 --> 00:30:02,443
Uh,
and then we still end up paying for 

704
00:30:04,001 --> 00:30:04,180
them.

705
00:30:04,180 --> 00:30:04,941
Right?
Don't address them,

706
00:30:04,941 --> 00:30:06,490
will automatically end up paying for 
them.

707
00:30:06,520 --> 00:30:07,690
Not automatically.
Again,

708
00:30:07,691 --> 00:30:08,524
if you get rid of all those regulations,
then then for service and then you have 

709
00:30:12,521 --> 00:30:13,354
to rely on charity.
And of course charity includes family 

710
00:30:17,321 --> 00:30:19,630
includes everybody else that might want 
to help you,

711
00:30:19,631 --> 00:30:22,600
but that you'll say,
well that's terrible.

712
00:30:22,601 --> 00:30:23,620
I wouldn't want to have to deal with 
that.

713
00:30:23,621 --> 00:30:24,454
Yes.
That's why you buy insurance and 

714
00:30:25,061 --> 00:30:27,940
advances because you don't want to be 
put in that position.

715
00:30:28,060 --> 00:30:30,820
Right?
So of course then you started late start

716
00:30:30,821 --> 00:30:32,980
thinking about the horrible cases.
Like what about a child boards,

717
00:30:32,981 --> 00:30:35,860
they're responsible parents and the 
child is a lifelong congenital disease.

718
00:30:36,070 --> 00:30:36,903
I say that's the kind of thing that 
charities are going to be very well 

719
00:30:39,191 --> 00:30:40,024
equipped to handle.
They're probably not going to be so 

720
00:30:41,141 --> 00:30:44,860
equipped to handle someone who's 25 and 
was earning a middle class income.

721
00:30:44,860 --> 00:30:45,693
It didn't feel like buying insurance and
then they come down with a horrible 

722
00:30:47,261 --> 00:30:48,094
problem.
Those are ones where I think you're 

723
00:30:49,810 --> 00:30:50,643
likely to be very low in priority and 
it's world like you're an adult and it 

724
00:30:52,721 --> 00:30:54,370
was your responsibility to take care of 
yourself.

725
00:30:54,830 --> 00:30:55,663
Uh,
but sort of in the background is the 

726
00:30:57,161 --> 00:30:57,994
issue of like,
how can you be so callous as to say if 

727
00:31:00,251 --> 00:31:03,160
you went and did something really dumb 
that it's just your own tough luck.

728
00:31:03,520 --> 00:31:06,250
And so I have this old blog post called 
tough luck,

729
00:31:06,490 --> 00:31:07,323
right?
So you know what every political 

730
00:31:08,111 --> 00:31:10,120
philosophy ultimately says tough luck to
people.

731
00:31:10,540 --> 00:31:12,460
It's just a question of where they draw 
the line.

732
00:31:12,461 --> 00:31:14,950
So you know there's the,
well,

733
00:31:15,160 --> 00:31:15,993
what if there's a conservative go 
conservative government power and they 

734
00:31:18,041 --> 00:31:22,480
can skip my son and he sent to another 
country and you get Eddie dies.

735
00:31:22,930 --> 00:31:23,890
What happens then?

736
00:31:24,790 --> 00:31:27,190
And of course the conservative answer is
ultimately,

737
00:31:27,370 --> 00:31:28,420
well,
tough luck.

738
00:31:28,450 --> 00:31:29,283
That's the system like in my system,
you can be conscripted if I didn't 

739
00:31:31,871 --> 00:31:32,681
worry,
you don't want to.

740
00:31:32,681 --> 00:31:36,220
And sometimes when that happens you get 
put into a lethal area and you die.

741
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:37,473
And like,
well my life has been ruined and what 

742
00:31:38,631 --> 00:31:40,060
are you going to do about it?
Nothing.

743
00:31:40,660 --> 00:31:45,430
And they'll give you a plaque or similar
yellow or the yellow like,

744
00:31:45,470 --> 00:31:46,211
you know,
similarly like,

745
00:31:46,211 --> 00:31:46,550
you know,
like,

746
00:31:46,550 --> 00:31:47,383
you know,
like even someone who is these a 

747
00:31:48,990 --> 00:31:51,820
supporter in the world of socialized 
medicine.

748
00:31:51,821 --> 00:31:56,260
So what if a person goes and cuts off 
their own legs and then.

749
00:31:56,320 --> 00:31:58,150
And then whenever you go and send 
someone to help them,

750
00:31:58,151 --> 00:31:59,980
they throw things at them.
What are you going to do then?

751
00:31:59,981 --> 00:32:02,560
Well then I guess tough luck all and 
that person,

752
00:32:02,561 --> 00:32:05,980
is this going to be alone and be 
suffering because they wouldn't go along

753
00:32:05,981 --> 00:32:06,814
with the system.

754
00:32:06,940 --> 00:32:07,773
All right?
So given that every single philosophy 

755
00:32:09,251 --> 00:32:10,084
ultimately says tough luck.
I don't see why people who believe in 

756
00:32:13,031 --> 00:32:15,880
the free market should feel,
especially embarrassed to say,

757
00:32:15,881 --> 00:32:16,750
well yeah,
my system.

758
00:32:16,751 --> 00:32:17,584
This is where we draw the line and if 
you have failed to do all of these 

759
00:32:20,261 --> 00:32:22,120
things than that,
it's here.

760
00:32:22,121 --> 00:32:25,240
Then it's your problem because there is 
no perfect system based.

761
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:26,193
There's no perfect system and and again 
like would it be a perfect system if 

762
00:32:29,290 --> 00:32:30,123
someone could be completely 
irresponsible 100 times in a row and 

763
00:32:31,961 --> 00:32:33,640
would still get treated like everybody 
else?

764
00:32:34,030 --> 00:32:34,863
Have they done any studies that you know
of where they've shown where in cases 

765
00:32:37,781 --> 00:32:40,430
that the government pulls back that

766
00:32:40,520 --> 00:32:43,910
charity does take care of this stuff so 
that in the case,

767
00:32:44,150 --> 00:32:46,310
which I think is a legitimate.
Like philosophically,

768
00:32:46,311 --> 00:32:50,630
I fully get what you're saying there 
that if we just pulled back a little bit

769
00:32:50,631 --> 00:32:53,060
that people would give more.
Is there evidence of that?

770
00:32:53,061 --> 00:32:53,740
Because I just

771
00:32:53,740 --> 00:32:56,170
so well so it's all.
Almost all the evidence is the other way

772
00:32:56,171 --> 00:32:57,004
around where it's.
There used to be private charity and 

773
00:32:58,961 --> 00:33:01,690
then government started doing it and 
then people measure what happened to the

774
00:33:01,691 --> 00:33:05,290
charity that was involved.
This is called crowding out.

775
00:33:05,291 --> 00:33:07,600
There's a whole field economic charity 
when they study this,

776
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:08,673
and this is a totally standard result 
that there are many areas that private 

777
00:33:12,041 --> 00:33:15,730
charity used to take care of,
like helping out the poor a demand now.

778
00:33:15,731 --> 00:33:16,564
And as government expanded its role,
the role of private charity shrank down 

779
00:33:19,301 --> 00:33:20,134
and eventually,
eventually private charity moved into 

780
00:33:21,041 --> 00:33:21,874
other areas.
The government wasn't doing very much 

781
00:33:22,571 --> 00:33:23,860
about.
So yeah,

782
00:33:23,861 --> 00:33:24,694
so you like in the thirties,
I was really only really use the 

783
00:33:28,271 --> 00:33:29,104
thirties or sort of when there was a big
transition because there were many 

784
00:33:30,761 --> 00:33:31,594
private organizations are things called 
fraternal clubs and organizations that 

785
00:33:35,020 --> 00:33:35,853
were private clubs that did a lot of 
things that the modern welfare state 

786
00:33:38,201 --> 00:33:38,560
does.

787
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:40,870
So if you lost your job that he,
they take care of you.

788
00:33:40,871 --> 00:33:42,940
If there were sickness,
they go and take care of you.

789
00:33:43,280 --> 00:33:44,540
Uh,
the thirties was single.

790
00:33:44,541 --> 00:33:48,480
It was such a protractive depression and
depression that fight,

791
00:33:48,670 --> 00:33:50,620
that partly started breaking down the 
end.

792
00:33:50,621 --> 00:33:52,090
But again,
a lot of it was government.

793
00:33:52,091 --> 00:33:54,360
Taylor took over and once government 
took over,

794
00:33:54,370 --> 00:33:55,203
there really wasn't much point to belong
to the organizations anymore except to 

795
00:33:57,071 --> 00:33:59,710
go and put on funny hats and have one 
once a month.

796
00:34:00,100 --> 00:34:00,821
But you know,
like a lot.

797
00:34:00,821 --> 00:34:05,110
A lot of these groups they like,
you remember your grandfather being part

798
00:34:05,111 --> 00:34:05,944
of like the elks or the odd fellows.
These actually provided these welfare 

799
00:34:08,981 --> 00:34:10,780
state functions privately in the past.

800
00:34:11,370 --> 00:34:15,720
So do you think that something like a 
government funded planned parenthood,

801
00:34:15,721 --> 00:34:17,550
which I'm sure regardless of your 
feelings on abortion,

802
00:34:17,551 --> 00:34:20,730
I'm sure you're not for the government 
funding that I can accept that part.

803
00:34:21,030 --> 00:34:23,130
So for myself,
I'm pro choice,

804
00:34:23,131 --> 00:34:23,964
but when I see all these people talking 
about public funding of all of these 

805
00:34:25,711 --> 00:34:26,544
things,
it does seem to me that if the 

806
00:34:28,321 --> 00:34:29,154
government stopped funding these things,
not made the illegal abortion but 

807
00:34:32,911 --> 00:34:33,744
stopped funding that this seems like a 
case were so many people are so 

808
00:34:36,510 --> 00:34:37,360
passionate about it.
Oh,

809
00:34:37,420 --> 00:34:38,253
all these people in Hollywood who are 
constantly tweeting about this and 

810
00:34:40,321 --> 00:34:41,154
screaming.
Right.

811
00:34:41,160 --> 00:34:43,290
But they would start funding these 
things.

812
00:34:43,291 --> 00:34:44,480
So is that a great example?

813
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:46,260
I think if anything,
it is a great example.

814
00:34:46,261 --> 00:34:47,640
I mean you're the here,
you know,

815
00:34:47,641 --> 00:34:48,474
here's the main thing that is troubling 
about the economics of charity is 

816
00:34:50,970 --> 00:34:53,100
there's a bunch of cars of the people 
that they care about and those.

817
00:34:53,101 --> 00:34:53,934
I'm not worried about those.
There's gonna be plenty of money for 

818
00:34:55,201 --> 00:34:57,210
them.
There's a bunch of other terrible things

819
00:34:57,211 --> 00:34:59,070
happening in the world that private 
charity,

820
00:34:59,071 --> 00:35:00,540
manifestly Evans hasn't solved.
It,

821
00:35:00,541 --> 00:35:01,374
hasn't gone unsolved.
International refugee problems and you 

822
00:35:03,420 --> 00:35:04,253
know,
it's doing something but they're still 

823
00:35:05,311 --> 00:35:06,144
terrible things going on.
Isn't solved a hunger in other 

824
00:35:07,921 --> 00:35:09,000
countries.
You know,

825
00:35:09,001 --> 00:35:09,834
the thing is that these are,
these are problems that taxpayers don't 

826
00:35:11,881 --> 00:35:14,820
care much about and that charitable gave
her some care very much about.

827
00:35:14,821 --> 00:35:16,240
So not you'll say we can,
you know,

828
00:35:16,290 --> 00:35:18,390
Bill Gates cares and you know,
he's,

829
00:35:18,391 --> 00:35:19,224
you know,
he's making a single handily making a 

830
00:35:20,531 --> 00:35:22,860
noticeable in the problem.
But again,

831
00:35:22,861 --> 00:35:25,650
so will sort of like the issues that 
people are really concerned about.

832
00:35:25,651 --> 00:35:28,440
The ones that have a lot of support for 
taxpayers to do something about it,

833
00:35:28,441 --> 00:35:32,670
about them are also very plausibly ones 
were private donors.

834
00:35:32,671 --> 00:35:33,504
We care a lot as well.

835
00:35:33,560 --> 00:35:34,393
Yeah.
Is there any situation where you think 

836
00:35:35,661 --> 00:35:38,190
regulation is necessary?
Is there,

837
00:35:38,191 --> 00:35:38,911
you know,
someone will.

838
00:35:38,911 --> 00:35:40,510
I'm sure someone watching this is going 
to comment.

839
00:35:40,540 --> 00:35:42,140
Well,
what about the rivers?

840
00:35:42,141 --> 00:35:44,130
They're going to pollute all the rivers 
or anything.

841
00:35:44,131 --> 00:35:45,870
Is there any instance where you see it 
as.

842
00:35:46,050 --> 00:35:46,770
Yeah.
So me,

843
00:35:46,770 --> 00:35:48,930
what I would say is,
I don't know.

844
00:35:49,560 --> 00:35:50,540
I would say so then,
you know,

845
00:35:50,541 --> 00:35:51,374
the again,
so there's a lot of areas where given 

846
00:35:52,471 --> 00:35:53,100
the,
given Gary,

847
00:35:53,100 --> 00:35:55,560
given the current setup,
it's very hard to see how,

848
00:35:55,561 --> 00:35:56,010
like,
how,

849
00:35:56,010 --> 00:35:59,610
like how either a for profit or even a 
shared a response to it.

850
00:35:59,930 --> 00:36:00,511
Uh,
again,

851
00:36:00,511 --> 00:36:01,344
the question in my mind is always,
if we imagine going into privatizing 

852
00:36:03,901 --> 00:36:05,160
things that government to government,
Ngo,

853
00:36:05,180 --> 00:36:06,013
government now does,
then what's left and then what's left 

854
00:36:09,121 --> 00:36:11,210
the charity can't handle.
So I mean,

855
00:36:11,230 --> 00:36:13,230
and again that's to me like,
you know,

856
00:36:13,260 --> 00:36:15,540
part of being an advocate of capitalist 
is least saying,

857
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:16,673
well let's privatized and see before 
saying there's no way that private 

858
00:36:20,101 --> 00:36:21,330
action are you going to handle this 
problem.

859
00:36:21,331 --> 00:36:22,164
Let's go and take and take a look.
And of course all the private solutions 

860
00:36:25,141 --> 00:36:27,210
may take a while to emerge,
but then again,

861
00:36:27,470 --> 00:36:27,851
like,
you know,

862
00:36:27,851 --> 00:36:30,990
like there are many problems the 
government has dealt with very poorly so

863
00:36:30,991 --> 00:36:31,350
far.

864
00:36:31,350 --> 00:36:34,110
So I don't think it's fair to say after 
a year,

865
00:36:34,380 --> 00:36:35,940
you know,
private sector hasn't solved this yet,

866
00:36:35,941 --> 00:36:36,774
so therefore clearly governments as 
theory will let me give it some more 

867
00:36:39,331 --> 00:36:40,320
time.
But again,

868
00:36:40,321 --> 00:36:42,990
like the ones that I think are the 
clearest cases are,

869
00:36:42,991 --> 00:36:43,890
you know,
air pollution.

870
00:36:44,610 --> 00:36:48,410
So that's one where it's very hard to 
exactly see how the privates,

871
00:36:48,570 --> 00:36:51,150
like how for profit for profit sector 
would handle it.

872
00:36:51,510 --> 00:36:54,370
It's one where because air pollution 
moves across the,

873
00:36:54,600 --> 00:36:56,290
they're bullish moves.
Like there's like you,

874
00:36:56,410 --> 00:36:58,230
you're not walking around in a bubble.
I get,

875
00:36:58,231 --> 00:36:59,820
it's one where,
well again,

876
00:36:59,821 --> 00:37:02,580
you're suppose that government didn't do
anything about it,

877
00:37:02,581 --> 00:37:04,470
but there's private charity involved,
right?

878
00:37:04,471 --> 00:37:06,610
Private charity to go and say subsidized
lower l,

879
00:37:06,611 --> 00:37:08,940
lower polluting technologies or offer 
prizes for lower,

880
00:37:08,980 --> 00:37:12,680
lower polluting technologies and then 
give away the patent so that these,

881
00:37:12,810 --> 00:37:15,090
the new technologies are really cheap.
I'll get in.

882
00:37:15,091 --> 00:37:17,430
So like us to like,
like how well that will work.

883
00:37:17,431 --> 00:37:19,260
I honest,
I honestly would have to say it's so far

884
00:37:19,261 --> 00:37:21,000
from where we are.
I don't know.

885
00:37:21,001 --> 00:37:23,130
But I think we,
I think we should give it a try.

886
00:37:23,270 --> 00:37:24,103
Yeah.
So most people watching this know that 

887
00:37:25,431 --> 00:37:27,740
I'm a limited government guy.
I believe in states rights.

888
00:37:27,741 --> 00:37:29,780
I would always rather be governed by 
the,

889
00:37:29,810 --> 00:37:30,643
by my mayor and my local representative.
And then February will be governed by 

890
00:37:33,531 --> 00:37:35,710
the mayor of Los Angeles.
All right.

891
00:37:35,780 --> 00:37:37,910
So you know,
he's a little,

892
00:37:37,911 --> 00:37:40,820
he lives a little closer to me than the,
than the people in DC,

893
00:37:40,821 --> 00:37:41,654
let's put it that way.
Regardless of my feelings of the mayor 

894
00:37:43,371 --> 00:37:45,440
of Los Angeles.
But generally speaking I want,

895
00:37:45,441 --> 00:37:47,480
I believe in local,
local control.

896
00:37:47,481 --> 00:37:52,130
So are there instances where local 
control has done this better?

897
00:37:52,131 --> 00:37:52,964
Like is there a,
is there a town you can point to or is 

898
00:37:54,471 --> 00:37:57,110
there a state maybe that's doing some of
this a little bit better?

899
00:37:57,330 --> 00:37:58,163
Let's see.
So given that there are so many states 

900
00:38:00,751 --> 00:38:02,880
and localities,
I'm sure that there are,

901
00:38:03,240 --> 00:38:05,090
I don't know off the top of the head 
which,

902
00:38:05,120 --> 00:38:06,480
which one,
which ones they are,

903
00:38:06,840 --> 00:38:07,860
but yeah,
so like

904
00:38:08,030 --> 00:38:11,720
is that partly just because the feds now
have so much control over everything?

905
00:38:11,721 --> 00:38:12,830
It's hard for states to do that.

906
00:38:13,090 --> 00:38:13,721
There is,
there is.

907
00:38:13,721 --> 00:38:14,291
But again,
blank,

908
00:38:14,291 --> 00:38:16,300
like you know,
so states do manage enormous amount.

909
00:38:16,301 --> 00:38:17,134
I'd say the main issue actually is just 
that the federal government provides so 

910
00:38:19,691 --> 00:38:20,524
much of the money for state governments 
that a lot of the competitive pressure 

911
00:38:24,701 --> 00:38:25,534
that you think would be operating is it 
has really been neutered by the fact 

912
00:38:29,171 --> 00:38:30,004
that states are just receive a bag of 
money from the federal government for 

913
00:38:32,741 --> 00:38:33,574
certain purposes and if they aren't 
allowed to and use it for other 

914
00:38:35,651 --> 00:38:36,484
purposes.
And so they have very little incentive 

915
00:38:38,171 --> 00:38:40,960
to try to figure out a way of saving 
taxpayers and the taxpayers money on it.

916
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:43,930
And often the money of course comes a 
lot of strings attached.

917
00:38:44,140 --> 00:38:46,420
If you don't want this rings and you 
have to give back all the money.

918
00:38:46,421 --> 00:38:50,110
So very few places want to do that.
So what would you do in a case when,

919
00:38:50,130 --> 00:38:51,680
uh,
you know,

920
00:38:51,730 --> 00:38:53,980
when we hear about federal money being 
used and everyone says,

921
00:38:53,981 --> 00:38:55,810
okay,
so like for example,

922
00:38:55,811 --> 00:38:56,291
like,
you know,

923
00:38:56,291 --> 00:38:57,124
Hurricane Sandy Hits in New Jersey,
the Jersey shore is destroyed and then 

924
00:39:00,821 --> 00:39:03,370
Obama was probably hundreds of millions 
of dollars.

925
00:39:03,370 --> 00:39:06,700
I don't know off the top of my head or,
or a hurricane Katrina in New Orleans.

926
00:39:07,030 --> 00:39:09,550
Do you again this would be the same 
thing.

927
00:39:09,551 --> 00:39:11,770
I think so like probably on private 
insurance,

928
00:39:11,771 --> 00:39:14,590
there's no reason that you couldn't have
private disaster insurance and of course

929
00:39:14,591 --> 00:39:16,510
there is a lot of private jets or 
insurance sold.

930
00:39:16,870 --> 00:39:17,703
Normally the feds get in where this area
is so high risk that the insurance will 

931
00:39:20,661 --> 00:39:23,920
be really expensive and people will be 
chomps don't feel like having to pay for

932
00:39:23,921 --> 00:39:25,680
it.
And so either the Fed,

933
00:39:25,690 --> 00:39:28,750
the feds take care of it or they 
subsidize it and again,

934
00:39:28,751 --> 00:39:29,081
like,
you know,

935
00:39:29,081 --> 00:39:29,914
so we,
especially to me the idea that someone 

936
00:39:31,091 --> 00:39:31,924
with a beach house to get some 
subsidized insurance because it's a 

937
00:39:33,700 --> 00:39:35,820
high,
it's a high disaster area around.

938
00:39:36,010 --> 00:39:38,140
I like the disaster.
I'm always baffled by that.

939
00:39:38,640 --> 00:39:40,030
They're limited in a beach house.

940
00:39:40,390 --> 00:39:41,223
Why can't they?
Why can't a person in a beach house be 

941
00:39:43,091 --> 00:39:45,070
expected to buy their own insurance?
Well,

942
00:39:45,071 --> 00:39:45,904
a lot of them do have insurance,
but they pay full market price for the 

943
00:39:49,810 --> 00:39:52,140
insurance.
So ultimately in a case like that would,

944
00:39:52,200 --> 00:39:56,110
would people then be forced to move from
a place like.

945
00:39:56,670 --> 00:39:58,060
So either you,
well,

946
00:39:58,061 --> 00:40:00,970
here's what we want to really be forced 
to move and tell the value of your home.

947
00:40:00,971 --> 00:40:02,860
False now.
Yes,

948
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:05,230
but eventually maybe a self select out.
Yeah.

949
00:40:05,231 --> 00:40:08,210
Yeah.
So I'm like really?

950
00:40:08,240 --> 00:40:11,230
Like really what would happen given the 
beach homes normally are very valuable,

951
00:40:11,231 --> 00:40:12,064
is that those homes would just be worth 
less because people realize if I move 

952
00:40:14,771 --> 00:40:15,604
into this home,
I'm gonna have to buy some really 

953
00:40:15,941 --> 00:40:17,980
expensive insurance.
So that doesn't sound very good.

954
00:40:17,981 --> 00:40:20,740
So ultimately of the like,
you know,

955
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:21,633
like subsidizing disaster insurance is a
subsidy to people who develop in high 

956
00:40:24,961 --> 00:40:25,794
and high and disaster prone areas,
especially the on land in those areas 

957
00:40:29,081 --> 00:40:29,914
are ultimately the people who really 
benefit from it because it raises the 

958
00:40:31,871 --> 00:40:32,704
value of that real estate's I guess I 
never really thought about it in those 

959
00:40:34,991 --> 00:40:36,040
specific terms,
but you know,

960
00:40:36,041 --> 00:40:36,874
I drive by Malibu here which is gorgeous
and all these rich people living on 

961
00:40:39,251 --> 00:40:43,090
these cliffs right on the water and at 
the end of the day if something horrible

962
00:40:43,091 --> 00:40:43,924
happened,
which of course we meet horrific 

963
00:40:45,050 --> 00:40:49,060
government would be then giving money to
people who chose to live there in a high

964
00:40:49,061 --> 00:40:49,894
risk thing because their insurance 
didn't go above and beyond whatever the 

965
00:40:52,751 --> 00:40:54,100
necessary of government requirements.

966
00:40:54,100 --> 00:40:56,020
Okay.
So me and my family lives in this area,

967
00:40:56,021 --> 00:40:59,620
so are laborers a couple miles from the 
North Ridge earthquake and back in 1994.

968
00:40:59,950 --> 00:41:00,783
And I know relatives who were just 
calling up fema and say and give me 

969
00:41:04,061 --> 00:41:04,960
money,
give me money.

970
00:41:04,961 --> 00:41:06,660
And they got money.
Like yell.

971
00:41:06,700 --> 00:41:10,720
It didn't matter like how rich you are 
or like what you had done or whether you

972
00:41:10,721 --> 00:41:12,180
had built your home safely.
It's like,

973
00:41:12,220 --> 00:41:13,053
like the,
like just the squeaky wheel gets the 

974
00:41:14,171 --> 00:41:15,004
grease.
Really all you have to do is pick up a 

975
00:41:15,641 --> 00:41:16,474
phone and so is that the real problem 
with all of this that ultimately by 

976
00:41:20,411 --> 00:41:25,411
doing all of this regulation that you 
punish people who do the right thing.

977
00:41:26,290 --> 00:41:28,480
In a case like this,
there's someone who built their house,

978
00:41:28,481 --> 00:41:29,314
earthquake safe,
bob invested their own money and all of 

979
00:41:31,721 --> 00:41:32,980
that.
Maybe had some,

980
00:41:33,380 --> 00:41:34,220
maybe didn't.
Northridge

981
00:41:34,220 --> 00:41:37,010
was a massive earthquake,
but then they're getting,

982
00:41:37,370 --> 00:41:40,250
they're not getting government money 
because they did the right thing and put

983
00:41:40,251 --> 00:41:41,084
their own money in it.

984
00:41:41,150 --> 00:41:42,740
Yeah.
So like.

985
00:41:43,390 --> 00:41:44,330
Absolutely.
So it's not,

986
00:41:44,331 --> 00:41:45,170
you know,
it's not fair.

987
00:41:45,171 --> 00:41:46,004
It's not just economists would also 
point out is that it's highly 

988
00:41:48,261 --> 00:41:49,094
inefficient because you're giving people
incentives to not do not do the right 

989
00:41:52,371 --> 00:41:53,720
things.
The other thing,

990
00:41:53,721 --> 00:41:54,120
you know,
the end,

991
00:41:54,120 --> 00:41:56,360
the final point is worth making is,
you know,

992
00:41:56,361 --> 00:41:57,194
so I'm,
I'm the kind of person who defends 

993
00:41:58,881 --> 00:41:59,714
radical and extreme views,
but I never want to alienate people who 

994
00:42:02,451 --> 00:42:03,284
are a little bit less radical,
a little bit less extreme in all these 

995
00:42:05,541 --> 00:42:06,840
cases.
Uh,

996
00:42:06,880 --> 00:42:07,300
like,
you know,

997
00:42:07,300 --> 00:42:08,240
I still say,
look,

998
00:42:08,270 --> 00:42:08,840
you know,
if you,

999
00:42:08,840 --> 00:42:09,673
if you're very concerned about small 
minority of very poor people who really 

1000
00:42:12,951 --> 00:42:15,020
couldn't afford afford insurance during 
this time,

1001
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:17,330
that aren't fine,
have a government program that,

1002
00:42:17,350 --> 00:42:17,880
that,
that,

1003
00:42:17,880 --> 00:42:18,713
that,
that subsidize it or provides insurance 

1004
00:42:20,210 --> 00:42:23,930
for orphan children,
for folio,

1005
00:42:24,040 --> 00:42:28,220
for kids who have terrible diseases for 
people who are very poor but happened to

1006
00:42:28,230 --> 00:42:29,330
be struck by disaster.

1007
00:42:29,690 --> 00:42:30,523
You know,
you can have a program that costs five 

1008
00:42:31,611 --> 00:42:33,290
percent as much as what we're currently 
doing.

1009
00:42:33,291 --> 00:42:34,124
We could ride,
get rid of 95 percent without really 

1010
00:42:36,171 --> 00:42:39,710
bumping into any of the complaints that 
role people have.

1011
00:42:39,980 --> 00:42:40,813
I'll say like,
well,

1012
00:42:40,900 --> 00:42:42,320
what about,
what about the poor?

1013
00:42:42,321 --> 00:42:43,154
What about kids?
What about people that they're 

1014
00:42:43,701 --> 00:42:45,740
responsible parents?
And still,

1015
00:42:45,741 --> 00:42:49,130
you could go 95 percent of the way to 
the libertarian policy.

1016
00:42:49,490 --> 00:42:50,323
And again,
so know I'm the kind of person who says 

1017
00:42:52,401 --> 00:42:55,130
what about the last five percent,
but I don't want to go and lose people,

1018
00:42:55,131 --> 00:42:58,250
lose people because who were willing to 
go the first 95?

1019
00:42:58,280 --> 00:43:00,680
So it's worth saying,
look with health insurance.

1020
00:43:00,681 --> 00:43:01,514
All right,
well maybe we'll see how government 

1021
00:43:02,871 --> 00:43:04,940
could still subsidize it for,
you know,

1022
00:43:05,030 --> 00:43:06,530
for kids,
the poor parents,

1023
00:43:06,710 --> 00:43:09,110
for people that are,
that we're born with a,

1024
00:43:09,111 --> 00:43:09,830
with a,
with a,

1025
00:43:09,830 --> 00:43:10,663
with a terrible congenital disease.
Like it just make a few exceptions and 

1026
00:43:13,521 --> 00:43:17,450
then stop making the exceptions.
Say like this small area,

1027
00:43:17,451 --> 00:43:18,284
this is where it's so terrible.
Government's going to pay for it out of 

1028
00:43:20,691 --> 00:43:22,910
taxpayer money.
Everyone else though,

1029
00:43:22,911 --> 00:43:24,710
Saker swim usually all like you're an 
adult.

1030
00:43:24,711 --> 00:43:25,700
You should take care of yourself.

1031
00:43:25,790 --> 00:43:26,623
Yeah.
You Must Bang your head on the wall 

1032
00:43:27,261 --> 00:43:28,094
every time people in public demand that 
the government throw more money at 

1033
00:43:30,771 --> 00:43:31,251
things,
right?

1034
00:43:31,251 --> 00:43:33,230
Because this is like,
it's always the easy answer.

1035
00:43:33,231 --> 00:43:36,530
It always see it feels right to people,
throw more money at it,

1036
00:43:37,050 --> 00:43:37,883
throw more,
and especially in the thrill and the 

1037
00:43:39,231 --> 00:43:43,010
throwing is a great image because it's 
just a lack of accuracy,

1038
00:43:43,250 --> 00:43:46,580
lack of lack of interest in actually 
targeting any specific

1039
00:43:46,600 --> 00:43:47,950
no problem.
So,

1040
00:43:47,951 --> 00:43:50,170
I mean,
I've just wrapped up a book on education

1041
00:43:50,171 --> 00:43:54,970
called the case against education where 
I argue for defunding education.

1042
00:43:55,900 --> 00:43:56,351
Right?
So,

1043
00:43:56,351 --> 00:43:57,161
yes.
I also like,

1044
00:43:57,161 --> 00:43:58,330
isn't that bad for you?
Well,

1045
00:43:58,390 --> 00:43:59,310
yeah,
it wouldn't be bad for me.

1046
00:43:59,330 --> 00:44:01,840
People listen,
but still my conscience says this is the

1047
00:44:01,841 --> 00:44:02,530
right thing to do.

1048
00:44:02,530 --> 00:44:02,971
Okay.
So,

1049
00:44:02,971 --> 00:44:04,780
so sell me on that.
I come from,

1050
00:44:04,810 --> 00:44:08,200
I went to a public elementary school,
public junior high public high school.

1051
00:44:08,320 --> 00:44:10,360
I went to State University of New York 
at Binghamton,

1052
00:44:10,361 --> 00:44:12,490
which was hugely subsidized by the 
government.

1053
00:44:12,670 --> 00:44:16,000
I think it was around $9,000
a year and I got a great education.

1054
00:44:16,340 --> 00:44:17,890
Uh,
why am I.

1055
00:44:18,490 --> 00:44:21,640
So I went to public schools right in 
this neighborhood actually.

1056
00:44:21,650 --> 00:44:23,940
Um,
but yeah,

1057
00:44:23,960 --> 00:44:27,560
like the heart of my case is something 
called the signaling model of education.

1058
00:44:28,060 --> 00:44:28,893
So you know this,
this is a fancy term for a common sense 

1059
00:44:30,741 --> 00:44:31,574
idea,
just says that a lot of the reason why 

1060
00:44:32,641 --> 00:44:36,420
education pays is not that as teaching 
useful job skills,

1061
00:44:36,570 --> 00:44:39,020
but rather you're jumping through hoops 
to show off for employers.

1062
00:44:40,110 --> 00:44:43,140
Right?
So just think about all the classes that

1063
00:44:43,141 --> 00:44:43,974
you ever had to take and then how few of
them are actually relevant to the job 

1064
00:44:47,341 --> 00:44:48,174
that you do.
You actually probably have a job where 

1065
00:44:49,321 --> 00:44:50,340
you do use more of a,
more,

1066
00:44:50,370 --> 00:44:51,220
more of what you studied.
You know,

1067
00:44:51,221 --> 00:44:52,380
I was a political sense.
Yes.

1068
00:44:52,400 --> 00:44:54,060
But yes.
But you know,

1069
00:44:54,070 --> 00:44:54,903
thinking about just think about all the 
classes that were required were you 

1070
00:44:57,811 --> 00:44:58,644
would not where you would not have been 
allowed to graduate without going 

1071
00:45:00,241 --> 00:45:01,074
through all of them.

1072
00:45:01,200 --> 00:45:04,210
So I mean I always have this example.
Imagine you're like one aristotle class,

1073
00:45:04,230 --> 00:45:08,010
shorter college graduation and yet you 
want to finish that class.

1074
00:45:08,011 --> 00:45:08,844
Why?
Because you're going to use the 

1075
00:45:09,361 --> 00:45:12,450
Nicomachean ethics and on the job 
probably not.

1076
00:45:12,780 --> 00:45:16,130
Rather because you want that diploma and
employers are like,

1077
00:45:16,140 --> 00:45:16,973
like many employers will just throw your
application right in the trash unless 

1078
00:45:19,351 --> 00:45:20,184
you have the diploma,
but do you lose something doing it your 

1079
00:45:21,571 --> 00:45:23,640
way because of just a certain breadth of
knowledge.

1080
00:45:23,641 --> 00:45:24,474
Now I'm not saying that every class 
should be mandated and of course they 

1081
00:45:26,551 --> 00:45:28,620
stick you in things that shouldn't be 
necessary,

1082
00:45:28,770 --> 00:45:29,603
but just that in terms of college 
specifically that that's where you 

1083
00:45:32,581 --> 00:45:35,970
should get a broad sense of knowledge.
Would that be at risk then?

1084
00:45:36,120 --> 00:45:36,990
Well,
here's the thing,

1085
00:45:36,991 --> 00:45:38,610
it's not at risk because almost no one 
gets it.

1086
00:45:38,611 --> 00:45:40,860
Now.
That's the.

1087
00:45:40,930 --> 00:45:41,763
So that is the harsh truth is that you 
just go and look at what graduates of 

1088
00:45:45,391 --> 00:45:46,170
the current system.

1089
00:45:46,170 --> 00:45:48,060
No,
it is next to nothing.

1090
00:45:48,750 --> 00:45:50,790
Right?
So there have been some great nationally

1091
00:45:50,791 --> 00:45:54,450
representative surveys of what American 
adults know about government,

1092
00:45:54,451 --> 00:45:56,280
about history,
about economics,

1093
00:45:56,610 --> 00:45:58,590
and the answer is they know next to 
nothing.

1094
00:45:58,830 --> 00:45:59,663
So if you were to defend the system 
saying that people need breadth of 

1095
00:46:01,291 --> 00:46:02,124
knowledge,
well it's not a defense of the current 

1096
00:46:03,211 --> 00:46:06,390
system because they have this current 
system is not giving it to them all.

1097
00:46:06,420 --> 00:46:07,253
The way that I like to think about it is
that typical American college graduate 

1098
00:46:11,670 --> 00:46:12,503
is lucky to maybe answer half of the 
most basic questions you can imagine on 

1099
00:46:16,051 --> 00:46:17,760
civics.
Now you might say,

1100
00:46:17,761 --> 00:46:18,720
well,
they then they.

1101
00:46:18,721 --> 00:46:21,810
That was still worthwhile.
I say it's not worthwhile because what,

1102
00:46:21,930 --> 00:46:24,690
what do you call someone who knows half 
their letters?

1103
00:46:25,290 --> 00:46:27,640
What do you call someone who knows half 
their letters and eating it?

1104
00:46:27,980 --> 00:46:30,570
It literally,
after letters,

1105
00:46:30,571 --> 00:46:32,400
you are illiterate,
illiterate,

1106
00:46:32,420 --> 00:46:33,300
even know what have your letters.

1107
00:46:33,540 --> 00:46:36,300
You are illiterate because you cannot 
read similarly saying,

1108
00:46:36,340 --> 00:46:38,490
if you know half the basic facts about,
uh,

1109
00:46:38,500 --> 00:46:41,070
about us history or about American 
government,

1110
00:46:41,520 --> 00:46:42,810
you don't know half of what you need to 
know.

1111
00:46:42,811 --> 00:46:46,260
You just don't know it at all.
If you don't have a clue,

1112
00:46:46,320 --> 00:46:48,420
if you think there are one and a half 
branches of government,

1113
00:46:49,510 --> 00:46:51,210
you just don't have a clue about what's 
going on.

1114
00:46:51,390 --> 00:46:53,130
And that's what the current system has 
given us.

1115
00:46:53,131 --> 00:46:55,740
So when people say like,
wouldn't this be a disaster?

1116
00:46:55,741 --> 00:46:56,460
And say,
well,

1117
00:46:56,460 --> 00:46:58,110
you might say the current system is a 
disaster,

1118
00:46:58,111 --> 00:46:59,880
but what I'm proposing wouldn't be 
worse.

1119
00:47:00,150 --> 00:47:01,770
Uh,
now there's always the question,

1120
00:47:01,771 --> 00:47:02,604
well,
but why not go and redouble our efforts 

1121
00:47:03,721 --> 00:47:05,280
so that people really do learn the 
stuff.

1122
00:47:05,530 --> 00:47:10,410
Main thing I'd say is like the resources
that it would take are so vast.

1123
00:47:10,770 --> 00:47:11,610
In fact,
I go,

1124
00:47:11,611 --> 00:47:13,620
I don't know of any actual sign that,
that,

1125
00:47:13,800 --> 00:47:15,330
that it,
that it could be done.

1126
00:47:15,530 --> 00:47:16,363
Uh,
and I,

1127
00:47:16,370 --> 00:47:17,071
you'll have,
I also,

1128
00:47:17,071 --> 00:47:17,904
I do have a way cheaper.
So a alternative to the current system 

1129
00:47:20,461 --> 00:47:22,170
for actually getting people to learn 
this stuff.

1130
00:47:22,590 --> 00:47:23,423
So this is,
this is one of my most reformers 

1131
00:47:24,601 --> 00:47:25,940
proposals.
So it does involve,

1132
00:47:25,980 --> 00:47:27,690
it doesn't involve government money,
but it's still,

1133
00:47:27,691 --> 00:47:31,480
I'd say a way use the government money 
than what we're doing right now.

1134
00:47:31,520 --> 00:47:32,710
Okay.
So here's the proposal.

1135
00:47:33,070 --> 00:47:36,820
Every year there is a government test of
your knowledge to civics.

1136
00:47:36,970 --> 00:47:38,410
And if you get a good score,
you get some money.

1137
00:47:38,890 --> 00:47:40,050
The end.
Alright.

1138
00:47:40,120 --> 00:47:41,140
Now what's the point of this?
Well,

1139
00:47:41,141 --> 00:47:42,580
two points,
first of all,

1140
00:47:42,581 --> 00:47:43,414
it gives people an incentive to actually
learn the material by how in whatever 

1141
00:47:46,751 --> 00:47:50,680
means actually works best.
So in the end you get something.

1142
00:47:50,690 --> 00:47:51,450
Yes,
Angela?

1143
00:47:51,450 --> 00:47:52,120
Yes.
Yes.

1144
00:47:52,120 --> 00:47:52,751
So like,
you know,

1145
00:47:52,751 --> 00:47:54,580
you could learn it on the Internet,
you can just read a book,

1146
00:47:54,610 --> 00:47:57,310
you could learn it in school,
like any possible method of learning.

1147
00:47:57,310 --> 00:47:58,143
The material is equally rewarded so it 
doesn't go and throw money to high 

1148
00:48:02,280 --> 00:48:03,113
school civics teachers who have 
manifestly failed to fail to actually 

1149
00:48:05,861 --> 00:48:06,694
generate a,
a knowledgeable public instead of just 

1150
00:48:08,591 --> 00:48:09,424
opens it up.
So and so say there's a war for knowing 

1151
00:48:10,841 --> 00:48:12,580
stuff.
However you learn it is fine.

1152
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:13,833
But the other reason why you do it every
year is because there is enormous 

1153
00:48:15,911 --> 00:48:16,744
evidence and educational psychology that
people generally forget what they 

1154
00:48:19,091 --> 00:48:22,180
learned very quickly.
So on test day,

1155
00:48:22,181 --> 00:48:25,300
actually I believe that most of the 
students in this class probably actually

1156
00:48:25,301 --> 00:48:27,980
kind of knew their stuff,
but what's what,

1157
00:48:28,090 --> 00:48:30,670
what psychologists called fade out is so
enormous.

1158
00:48:30,910 --> 00:48:32,800
Just the way,
like in one year out the next,

1159
00:48:32,801 --> 00:48:34,720
if you don't keep testing it,
you'll keep using it.

1160
00:48:34,721 --> 00:48:36,970
You lose it so you have the test every 
year.

1161
00:48:36,971 --> 00:48:37,804
This would actually lead to retention of
knowledge over time where people would 

1162
00:48:40,811 --> 00:48:43,660
not immediately forget the material as 
soon as they learn it because like wow,

1163
00:48:43,661 --> 00:48:45,130
I need to know what next year and the 
year after that,

1164
00:48:45,131 --> 00:48:45,964
every year I can get another hundred 
bucks off of showing that I know my 

1165
00:48:48,641 --> 00:48:49,474
stuff.

1166
00:48:49,630 --> 00:48:50,670
So.
And there's no,

1167
00:48:50,671 --> 00:48:52,360
you don't think there's a way to 
prioritize that then.

1168
00:48:53,380 --> 00:48:55,320
So you can do with charity.
I'll be like,

1169
00:48:55,420 --> 00:48:59,650
this is legal and no charity has done it
for so I'm not too optimistic about that

1170
00:48:59,651 --> 00:49:00,620
happening.
But yeah,

1171
00:49:00,621 --> 00:49:03,970
like if some,
if some donor right now is interested in

1172
00:49:03,971 --> 00:49:04,840
doing this,
this would be great.

1173
00:49:04,841 --> 00:49:07,930
But anyway,
this will be so much cheaper than high.

1174
00:49:07,970 --> 00:49:12,040
Then all the high school social sciences
classes that we offer right now,

1175
00:49:12,250 --> 00:49:13,083
whatever you bros will ask,
people often start freaking out who's 

1176
00:49:14,111 --> 00:49:15,730
going to write the test?
And I say,

1177
00:49:15,731 --> 00:49:19,810
well look right now a key part of civics
is knowing the answers the teacher wants

1178
00:49:19,811 --> 00:49:20,644
to hear.
So like even like as long as you know 

1179
00:49:23,231 --> 00:49:26,230
that there's a certain bias on the,
on the official civics test,

1180
00:49:26,470 --> 00:49:29,110
you just vacate and like in order to do 
well and it,

1181
00:49:29,111 --> 00:49:30,520
you still have to learn a bunch of 
stuff.

1182
00:49:30,521 --> 00:49:31,354
So you know,
I mean I had so many college classes 

1183
00:49:33,071 --> 00:49:35,440
where I disagreed with the professor.
I still learn,

1184
00:49:35,441 --> 00:49:37,270
I learned what the answer is they wanted
to hear,

1185
00:49:37,510 --> 00:49:38,343
but I also learned the material the same
time and there's no reason why you 

1186
00:49:40,811 --> 00:49:43,310
couldn't do that.
Do apply the same thing.

1187
00:49:43,770 --> 00:49:45,950
So I don't,
I don't see that it's really such a.

1188
00:49:46,690 --> 00:49:47,830
Such a terrible deal.

1189
00:49:47,890 --> 00:49:48,723
Yeah.
I'd love to see the fadeout rate for 

1190
00:49:49,601 --> 00:49:50,434
kids the day after the sats because I 
remember studying for that thing and go 

1191
00:49:53,290 --> 00:49:57,070
united tutor with a group of friends.
But I remember thinking,

1192
00:49:57,071 --> 00:49:58,510
man,
when I'm done with this thing,

1193
00:49:58,511 --> 00:50:02,500
I am going to let go of all this.
And I had taken the test probably a week

1194
00:50:02,500 --> 00:50:03,300
later.
I,

1195
00:50:03,300 --> 00:50:04,900
I'm probably to have the scores on that.

1196
00:50:05,140 --> 00:50:07,580
I mean this is some of the most 
interesting research in psychology.

1197
00:50:07,581 --> 00:50:12,020
So there's a lot of research on fade out
in school where you go and you teach the

1198
00:50:12,021 --> 00:50:12,854
kids something and then you go and 
measure it one or two years later in 

1199
00:50:14,631 --> 00:50:16,990
school.
But the really scary,

1200
00:50:17,120 --> 00:50:20,750
really scary fade out is from school to 
adulthood because of the kids in school.

1201
00:50:20,751 --> 00:50:22,520
At least they kind of know I'm going to 
have to learn this again.

1202
00:50:22,521 --> 00:50:24,890
I might get tested on again.
But once you finally graduate,

1203
00:50:24,891 --> 00:50:26,000
that's it.
That's the end.

1204
00:50:26,420 --> 00:50:27,253
So there's a fantastic study,
a retention of higher mathematics 

1205
00:50:29,961 --> 00:50:33,380
throughout life and like Algebra and 
geometry,

1206
00:50:33,830 --> 00:50:35,330
like were they.
Within a couple of decades,

1207
00:50:35,331 --> 00:50:36,164
most people took those classes just know
or back to where they were before they 

1208
00:50:38,271 --> 00:50:39,104
even actually started the classes.
The only people remember their Algebra 

1209
00:50:41,871 --> 00:50:42,704
and geometry are people who go all the 
way up to calculus to go all the way to 

1210
00:50:45,980 --> 00:50:46,640
Canada.

1211
00:50:46,640 --> 00:50:49,520
Then you go and retain Algebra and 
geometry for the rest of your life,

1212
00:50:49,880 --> 00:50:54,060
but you have to go way beyond a subject 
to actually retain the,

1213
00:50:54,980 --> 00:50:56,680
retain the basics.
Any of that.

1214
00:50:57,060 --> 00:50:59,100
This all fits with like,
like,

1215
00:50:59,160 --> 00:51:02,750
like say,
like use it or lose it or a tiger mom.

1216
00:51:02,751 --> 00:51:04,510
Amy Chu has a great slogan like 
everyday,

1217
00:51:04,520 --> 00:51:06,080
everyday,
everyday you don't practice as a day you

1218
00:51:06,081 --> 00:51:07,810
get worse.
So you,

1219
00:51:07,820 --> 00:51:09,050
this,
this does go with well.

1220
00:51:09,051 --> 00:51:11,810
So why bother teaching people things 
they're just going to forget.

1221
00:51:11,811 --> 00:51:13,330
Anyway,
so I mean this,

1222
00:51:13,331 --> 00:51:14,164
this is part of my critique of like,
like what's wrong with throwing so much 

1223
00:51:16,971 --> 00:51:17,804
money at education?
You have to say we'll get like now of 

1224
00:51:20,031 --> 00:51:24,120
course none of this denies that schools 
do teach them useful material but again,

1225
00:51:24,270 --> 00:51:27,650
my view is already again,
so like for the useful material,

1226
00:51:27,651 --> 00:51:28,484
like you're like most people can pay for
it probably like most people's parents 

1227
00:51:30,171 --> 00:51:33,320
can pay for it and then if there's going
to be any role for government,

1228
00:51:33,321 --> 00:51:34,154
let it be for the small minority of kids
whose parents are not able to take care 

1229
00:51:37,491 --> 00:51:38,150
of them or shared.

1230
00:51:38,150 --> 00:51:38,983
He's not taking care of them.
And then for just that last sliver of 

1231
00:51:41,091 --> 00:51:41,924
people let you know they don't like it.
There's going to be a role for 

1232
00:51:43,401 --> 00:51:44,270
government.
Let it be that.

1233
00:51:44,271 --> 00:51:46,730
So don't throw money at a problem,
there's going to be money,

1234
00:51:46,731 --> 00:51:47,564
let it be narrowly targeted to give,
to be mindful that you are taking money 

1235
00:51:52,491 --> 00:51:53,324
from taxpayers without their consent and
at minimum you owe them responsibility 

1236
00:51:56,361 --> 00:51:57,290
to spend the money.
Well,

1237
00:51:57,291 --> 00:51:59,230
I think that's seems like a really basic
thing.

1238
00:51:59,260 --> 00:52:01,730
I think we've given up that that minimum
a long time.

1239
00:52:01,731 --> 00:52:02,970
Yeah.
But even like,

1240
00:52:02,990 --> 00:52:04,220
you know,
so it's one thing to say,

1241
00:52:04,221 --> 00:52:05,680
look,
this is so important that we're going to

1242
00:52:05,690 --> 00:52:08,450
that where that you have to pay whether 
you like it or not too bad,

1243
00:52:08,750 --> 00:52:11,180
but then go and spend that money.
He Leslie,

1244
00:52:11,390 --> 00:52:15,320
that seems like it's really a true.
Like honestly,

1245
00:52:15,380 --> 00:52:18,440
like that seems like a true human rights
abuse.

1246
00:52:18,441 --> 00:52:21,410
To take someone for money at gunpoint 
and then just blow it.

1247
00:52:22,340 --> 00:52:24,090
Like without saying,
well maybe this will do something.

1248
00:52:24,091 --> 00:52:26,630
Who knows?
Maybe if that's your attitude,

1249
00:52:26,631 --> 00:52:28,610
you shouldn't have taken my money.
You shouldn't be like,

1250
00:52:28,640 --> 00:52:31,340
maybe you should have asked me,
but you shouldn't have made me if that's

1251
00:52:31,341 --> 00:52:32,270
all you've got.

1252
00:52:32,440 --> 00:52:35,680
All right,
let's shift slightly from economics.

1253
00:52:35,860 --> 00:52:36,401
Which,
by the way,

1254
00:52:36,401 --> 00:52:37,234
I want to tell you that I think most of 
my audience I think is classically 

1255
00:52:39,821 --> 00:52:42,340
liberal or Libertarian,
I think is the,

1256
00:52:42,440 --> 00:52:43,273
is the big chunk of it.
So I think they're going to be with you 

1257
00:52:44,471 --> 00:52:45,304
on a lot of this.
So let's get to some stuff that I think 

1258
00:52:46,391 --> 00:52:47,224
that they may not be with you as much.
So let's talk about borders and 

1259
00:52:49,961 --> 00:52:50,794
immigration for a second.
So are for a couple minutes at least a 

1260
00:52:53,900 --> 00:52:54,910
year.
An open borders guy.

1261
00:52:54,970 --> 00:52:55,840
I am.
I am.

1262
00:52:55,841 --> 00:52:58,690
Yes.
So with everything going on in the world

1263
00:52:58,691 --> 00:52:59,524
right now,
give me your best pitch for open 

1264
00:53:00,491 --> 00:53:02,050
borders,
which I am not.

1265
00:53:02,430 --> 00:53:03,280
All right,
let everything go.

1266
00:53:03,280 --> 00:53:03,420
I didn't know

1267
00:53:03,420 --> 00:53:04,253
y'all going on in the world.
So first step is to say the stuff you 

1268
00:53:06,751 --> 00:53:09,920
see on the news is so statistically rare
that no sensible person would even worry

1269
00:53:09,921 --> 00:53:10,790
about it.
Very much.

1270
00:53:11,030 --> 00:53:13,970
So like terrorism,
like on the news all the time,

1271
00:53:14,180 --> 00:53:16,340
it is one of the smallest problems on 
earth,

1272
00:53:16,820 --> 00:53:17,653
right?
So if you just go in and look at the 

1273
00:53:18,351 --> 00:53:20,380
data and you'll.
And you will see alright,

1274
00:53:20,420 --> 00:53:21,253
so deaths from murder is like under one 
percent of all deaths and terrorist 

1275
00:53:26,971 --> 00:53:28,950
murders under one percent of all 
murders.

1276
00:53:29,190 --> 00:53:30,023
So why is it that people are so worried 
about it and we have spent over a 

1277
00:53:34,590 --> 00:53:35,423
trillion dollars in the war on terror 
because it has vivid because it is 

1278
00:53:37,441 --> 00:53:38,274
emotionally effecting.
So I'd say like the first thing that we 

1279
00:53:40,381 --> 00:53:45,381
have to do is calm down and apply 
numeracy and just like say like here's a

1280
00:53:46,021 --> 00:53:47,160
problem.
Everyone's worried about it.

1281
00:53:47,160 --> 00:53:50,520
Is it really a serious problem that we 
should be concerned about or not?

1282
00:53:51,030 --> 00:53:51,980
Right.
And you know,

1283
00:53:52,010 --> 00:53:53,640
I say like terrorism is probably the 
most,

1284
00:53:53,860 --> 00:53:55,680
the strongest,
most emotional critique.

1285
00:53:55,681 --> 00:53:59,700
People have immigration and yet it is 
not actually a sensible thing to be able

1286
00:53:59,701 --> 00:54:00,534
to be worried about it,
but how much and how much of it is 

1287
00:54:02,191 --> 00:54:03,024
because what we're doing is actually 
working so that we know we're keeping a 

1288
00:54:06,451 --> 00:54:07,284
certain amount of people would love to 
come in here and blow things up and 

1289
00:54:09,230 --> 00:54:11,100
murdered.
What I'd say is there's,

1290
00:54:11,101 --> 00:54:11,934
you know,
there's a lot of ways that we could go 

1291
00:54:12,571 --> 00:54:13,790
and test whether the stuff that,
that,

1292
00:54:13,830 --> 00:54:14,280
that,
that,

1293
00:54:14,280 --> 00:54:15,660
that,
that we have is working.

1294
00:54:16,020 --> 00:54:16,900
Uh,
so there's,

1295
00:54:16,960 --> 00:54:18,900
there's,
there's a great political scientist,

1296
00:54:18,901 --> 00:54:21,510
John Mueller as a book called overblown,
going over all of it.

1297
00:54:21,810 --> 00:54:22,643
So one thing we can do is just look at 
where called near misses so you can go 

1298
00:54:25,741 --> 00:54:26,330
and see you,
right?

1299
00:54:26,330 --> 00:54:28,080
Like how many terrorist thoughts are 
that failed,

1300
00:54:28,410 --> 00:54:30,420
which gives us an idea how fast,
how much is they go,

1301
00:54:30,430 --> 00:54:32,070
what we're currently doing actually 
working.

1302
00:54:32,130 --> 00:54:34,080
So like the shoe bomber for things like 
that.

1303
00:54:34,081 --> 00:54:34,914
So you know,
when you go and expand the sample to 

1304
00:54:37,140 --> 00:54:37,861
all,
to all,

1305
00:54:37,861 --> 00:54:40,950
to all the failed cases and especially 
when you go and look carefully,

1306
00:54:40,951 --> 00:54:41,784
not just the things that the government 
classifies as terrorism so they can go 

1307
00:54:43,891 --> 00:54:46,650
and get a photo op.
But things that actually when you really

1308
00:54:46,651 --> 00:54:50,010
look at was an actual terrorist plots 
where they had gotten,

1309
00:54:50,060 --> 00:54:50,893
where they had done something more than 
say we should have a terrorist plots 

1310
00:54:53,460 --> 00:54:54,470
again,
is still.

1311
00:54:54,471 --> 00:54:57,300
It still remains incredibly rare.
Now another test,

1312
00:54:57,301 --> 00:54:58,134
uh,
this was actually one of my favorite 

1313
00:54:58,441 --> 00:54:59,274
ones is for all the people think that 
it's really easy to get into Mexico 

1314
00:55:02,280 --> 00:55:04,740
should mean that it's really easy for 
terrorists to get in from Mexico.

1315
00:55:05,040 --> 00:55:08,700
And yet the actual number that had done 
this is exceeded extremely small.

1316
00:55:09,090 --> 00:55:09,923
Uh,
so in like,

1317
00:55:09,930 --> 00:55:12,270
in fact,
I'm not sure there's been any case of,

1318
00:55:12,290 --> 00:55:14,100
of any,
of any terrorists coming,

1319
00:55:14,210 --> 00:55:15,240
you know,
cross crossing,

1320
00:55:15,420 --> 00:55:17,720
crossing from Mexico and doing anything.
So again,

1321
00:55:17,750 --> 00:55:18,041
like,
you know,

1322
00:55:18,041 --> 00:55:18,874
so if you were someone who thinks that 
the border is port is poorly guarded 

1323
00:55:20,751 --> 00:55:21,584
right now,
then it doesn't make a lot of sense to 

1324
00:55:23,401 --> 00:55:24,234
think that current anti terrorist 
policies are preventing a lot just 

1325
00:55:26,131 --> 00:55:28,350
because it's so easy for them to do 
this.

1326
00:55:28,351 --> 00:55:30,780
Now,
I would say that our actually our,

1327
00:55:30,781 --> 00:55:31,110
our,
you know,

1328
00:55:31,110 --> 00:55:34,400
our borders guarded very well in the 
sense that people pay about five,

1329
00:55:34,430 --> 00:55:36,360
about $4,000
to get smuggled across.

1330
00:55:36,790 --> 00:55:37,623
So for the kind of people who are,
who are smuggling or who are coming 

1331
00:55:39,361 --> 00:55:41,010
across the border that several years 
income,

1332
00:55:41,220 --> 00:55:42,780
it's a big deal,
but it's,

1333
00:55:42,781 --> 00:55:44,460
you know,
it's a big deal for a rural Mexican farm

1334
00:55:44,461 --> 00:55:45,294
worker,
but it's not a big deal for a serious 

1335
00:55:46,630 --> 00:55:47,240
terrorist.

1336
00:55:47,240 --> 00:55:49,130
You're serious terrorist and you can't 
come up with 5,000

1337
00:55:49,150 --> 00:55:52,050
bucks for your plot and then like you,
like you're a joke.

1338
00:55:52,320 --> 00:55:52,881
So,
I mean,

1339
00:55:52,881 --> 00:55:57,240
I'd say that.
So like the idea that there,

1340
00:55:57,241 --> 00:55:58,074
that there really is a serious problem 
or that we have done much about it as I 

1341
00:56:00,331 --> 00:56:01,650
think just wrong.
Uh,

1342
00:56:01,720 --> 00:56:02,870
this is like they're very,
you know,

1343
00:56:02,880 --> 00:56:04,880
so again,
that'd be going to settle again,

1344
00:56:04,890 --> 00:56:06,780
the stuff on the news and stuff that 
people really care about now.

1345
00:56:06,781 --> 00:56:08,970
What is the case in favor of open 
borders?

1346
00:56:09,580 --> 00:56:10,413
Again,
it's the kind of thing that you almost 

1347
00:56:10,951 --> 00:56:12,570
never see on the news,
but.

1348
00:56:12,600 --> 00:56:14,470
So yeah,
so I mean there,

1349
00:56:14,550 --> 00:56:16,390
there's the others,
the economic case and,

1350
00:56:16,391 --> 00:56:17,720
and the human rights case.
So yeah,

1351
00:56:17,750 --> 00:56:22,700
like the economic case is very simple to
just says that the most,

1352
00:56:22,800 --> 00:56:25,360
all the very best way that we know of,
of,

1353
00:56:25,530 --> 00:56:26,363
of you increase in the production of 
mankind is to move people from poor 

1354
00:56:29,531 --> 00:56:30,760
countries to rich countries.

1355
00:56:31,270 --> 00:56:31,750
I,
yeah,

1356
00:56:31,750 --> 00:56:34,450
it is almost like magic.
You take a Haitian was making a dollar a

1357
00:56:34,451 --> 00:56:38,080
day and port-au-prince moved to Miami 
and suddenly he's making $40 a day.

1358
00:56:38,610 --> 00:56:39,460
Alright.
So I was like,

1359
00:56:39,461 --> 00:56:42,850
his productivity increases by a factor 
of 40 and you're like,

1360
00:56:42,880 --> 00:56:44,560
how is that possible?
Right.

1361
00:56:44,561 --> 00:56:45,394
You know,
so you'd probably doesn't even speak 

1362
00:56:45,911 --> 00:56:48,000
English at first.
He speaks French and the,

1363
00:56:48,050 --> 00:56:48,883
the answer is his Labor is extremely 
unproductive and Haiti and extremely 

1364
00:56:51,431 --> 00:56:52,264
productive in the United States.
Even very unskilled workers produce far 

1365
00:56:55,151 --> 00:56:57,160
more in rich countries.
And they do in poorer countries,

1366
00:56:57,161 --> 00:56:59,230
poor countries are screwed up in so many
ways.

1367
00:56:59,620 --> 00:57:00,860
So like,
you know,

1368
00:57:00,940 --> 00:57:04,810
this is one of the most amazing things 
that you can do about poverty is to move

1369
00:57:04,811 --> 00:57:06,280
people from poor countries,
rich countries.

1370
00:57:06,281 --> 00:57:07,114
Then overnight,
what they can accomplish multiplies and 

1371
00:57:09,191 --> 00:57:12,760
not by like 10 percent or 20 percent by 
five times,

1372
00:57:12,761 --> 00:57:14,170
10 times,
20 times.

1373
00:57:14,170 --> 00:57:18,640
It is amazing and of course radiology 
know if you understand the basic trade,

1374
00:57:18,670 --> 00:57:20,470
this doesn't just benefit the 
immigrants,

1375
00:57:20,650 --> 00:57:23,140
it benefits everyone who's consuming 
that product,

1376
00:57:23,141 --> 00:57:26,830
so the benefit benefits all of the stuff
that the immigrants make mead right now,

1377
00:57:26,831 --> 00:57:28,930
Haiti is pretty much irrelevant to the 
global economy.

1378
00:57:29,200 --> 00:57:31,150
If you were to move those Haitians to 
Florida,

1379
00:57:31,480 --> 00:57:35,820
suddenly the global economy would be 
Richard by a very large amounts and in a

1380
00:57:35,830 --> 00:57:38,740
lot of the actual production will be 
consumed not just by the Haitians,

1381
00:57:38,741 --> 00:57:41,110
but it would be consumed by,
you know,

1382
00:57:41,140 --> 00:57:41,973
by the people that are eating and 
Haitian restaurants by the people that 

1383
00:57:43,421 --> 00:57:46,210
are hiring Haitian nannies or rh 
variation gardeners.

1384
00:57:46,420 --> 00:57:47,253
All these things that right now 
currently are not happening now when 

1385
00:57:49,631 --> 00:57:51,310
economists have just tried to get an 
estimate,

1386
00:57:51,311 --> 00:57:52,144
like how much are we losing from these 
border restrictions from trapping all 

1387
00:57:55,430 --> 00:57:57,490
this valuable labor in poor countries.

1388
00:57:57,800 --> 00:58:00,410
You know,
a pretty good estimate is that we are,

1389
00:58:00,580 --> 00:58:02,810
is that immigration restrictions are 
having the,

1390
00:58:02,840 --> 00:58:03,673
the production of the world we would be 
with the world will be twice as rich if 

1391
00:58:07,511 --> 00:58:08,344
anyone could take a job anywhere and 
again it's things like what could you 

1392
00:58:10,481 --> 00:58:12,250
accomplish in Haiti?
So you are actually,

1393
00:58:12,370 --> 00:58:15,160
you might be able to have to reset up 
the revenue a hell of a show in Haiti,

1394
00:58:15,430 --> 00:58:18,950
although you'd have trouble getting your
guests so,

1395
00:58:19,840 --> 00:58:20,990
so cheap.
I could find.

1396
00:58:22,590 --> 00:58:24,940
Maybe I said it will be,
but in general,

1397
00:58:25,150 --> 00:58:27,340
most people when you picture what could 
I do in Haiti,

1398
00:58:27,341 --> 00:58:28,174
it's very little.
I guess the main difference between a 

1399
00:58:31,121 --> 00:58:31,571
you'll be,
oh,

1400
00:58:31,571 --> 00:58:32,404
so between Haitians and Americans is 
that Haitians are stuck in Haiti and 

1401
00:58:35,591 --> 00:58:36,424
yes.
So it's true that their skills are low 

1402
00:58:37,631 --> 00:58:38,464
by American standards spots.
They can do so much more here than they 

1403
00:58:41,051 --> 00:58:41,430
couldn't come.

1404
00:58:41,430 --> 00:58:42,610
They can,
they can do back at home.

1405
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:43,833
So what now?
So what does act when people say open 

1406
00:58:45,701 --> 00:58:47,410
borders,
what does that actually mean?

1407
00:58:47,440 --> 00:58:51,670
You mean that could people just wander 
in from Canada and Mexico?

1408
00:58:53,040 --> 00:58:55,930
Are we shutting down the places that 
they walked through?

1409
00:58:56,120 --> 00:58:58,840
So I would say that means that I would 
call that no borders.

1410
00:58:58,960 --> 00:59:00,790
Okay.
I'd be willing to defend that too.

1411
00:59:00,820 --> 00:59:01,653
But that's not my main pitch.
My main pitch is open borders where the 

1412
00:59:04,211 --> 00:59:07,540
way I think about it is if,
unless someone belongs in jail,

1413
00:59:07,600 --> 00:59:09,310
he can go.
He can move to any country wants.

1414
00:59:09,311 --> 00:59:12,340
He lived there and he can work there.
So unless blood.

1415
00:59:12,370 --> 00:59:13,250
What does that mean though?
So you.

1416
00:59:13,270 --> 00:59:14,470
Okay,
you're a Canadian,

1417
00:59:14,471 --> 00:59:15,304
you want to come to.
And as you walk through the sanction 

1418
00:59:16,800 --> 00:59:17,633
border,
even though you said you might 

1419
00:59:18,430 --> 00:59:19,263
potentially but the other thing,
but you walk through how you are you a 

1420
00:59:21,240 --> 00:59:22,730
citizen,
they knew they would get,

1421
00:59:22,740 --> 00:59:23,900
like I said,
so you can live there,

1422
00:59:23,940 --> 00:59:24,800
you can work there.
It doesn't make.

1423
00:59:24,801 --> 00:59:25,970
It doesn't make you a citizen.
Right.

1424
00:59:26,240 --> 00:59:27,073
So maybe you're never miss out again.
And so like to me the heart of under 

1425
00:59:28,890 --> 00:59:29,723
orders isn't citizenship.
It's the right to live the right to end 

1426
00:59:31,661 --> 00:59:33,590
the and the right to work.
Right?

1427
00:59:33,591 --> 00:59:34,221
Which of course,
things,

1428
00:59:34,221 --> 00:59:34,660
you do this

1429
00:59:34,660 --> 00:59:36,790
for an unlimited amount of time because 
then in effect,

1430
00:59:36,791 --> 00:59:39,970
you're probably going to get all the 
rights of a citizen at some point.

1431
00:59:40,130 --> 00:59:40,930
Uh,
you might.

1432
00:59:40,930 --> 00:59:41,311
But,
so,

1433
00:59:41,311 --> 00:59:41,790
you know,
I,

1434
00:59:41,790 --> 00:59:42,980
I'm not,
I'm not against that,

1435
00:59:43,060 --> 00:59:44,820
but to get that is not to yell,
but I,

1436
00:59:44,821 --> 00:59:46,880
but I also not strongly for that.
Uh,

1437
00:59:46,980 --> 00:59:49,320
what I'm strongly for is the right of 
any human being.

1438
00:59:49,321 --> 00:59:52,200
It doesn't belong in jail to live and 
work in any country that he wants.

1439
00:59:52,500 --> 00:59:53,910
So again,
I already mentioned the economic case.

1440
00:59:53,911 --> 00:59:54,744
I mean,
do you need the human rights case is 

1441
00:59:55,920 --> 00:59:57,500
basically what it look like.
This though,

1442
00:59:57,510 --> 00:59:58,800
this is a human being.
He wants,

1443
00:59:58,801 --> 01:00:01,440
sells like there's someone who wants to 
rent them an apartment right here.

1444
01:00:01,590 --> 01:00:03,270
There's someone who wants to hire him 
here.

1445
01:00:03,540 --> 01:00:05,700
What business is any stranger f saying 
no.

1446
01:00:06,570 --> 01:00:07,500
So maybe.
So we know.

1447
01:00:07,501 --> 01:00:08,610
So I,
I have,

1448
01:00:08,640 --> 01:00:09,473
uh,
I've,

1449
01:00:09,480 --> 01:00:11,820
I've compared immigration laws to Jim 
crow laws.

1450
01:00:12,120 --> 01:00:14,400
I said the main difference is that 
immigration laws are worse.

1451
01:00:14,730 --> 01:00:15,563
Jim Crow Law said that there are some 
areas where blacks couldn't live in the 

1452
01:00:18,930 --> 01:00:19,090
United States.

1453
01:00:19,090 --> 01:00:20,820
There are some jobs blacks couldn't 
take.

1454
01:00:21,090 --> 01:00:23,820
What our immigration law say is that if 
you are a Mexican citizen,

1455
01:00:24,030 --> 01:00:24,863
there is no place in the country you can
legally live and no job in the country 

1456
01:00:28,141 --> 01:00:29,850
you can legally work,
right?

1457
01:00:29,851 --> 01:00:32,070
That seems way worse than Jim Crow.
And again,

1458
01:00:32,071 --> 01:00:33,220
what's the difference?
So it will be,

1459
01:00:33,270 --> 01:00:35,100
will you have to become a citizen?
And then uk?

1460
01:00:35,130 --> 01:00:35,963
Yes.
Well,

1461
01:00:36,160 --> 01:00:38,340
but the only citizen is almost 
impossible for someone,

1462
01:00:38,370 --> 01:00:39,690
for someone who's worn a Mexican 
citizen,

1463
01:00:39,691 --> 01:00:41,400
unless of course you have a close blood 
relative,

1464
01:00:42,030 --> 01:00:42,863
you are generally out of luck.
I mean sort of the idea of why don't 

1465
01:00:44,521 --> 01:00:45,354
they just go and get in line.
The answer is for most people on earth 

1466
01:00:47,521 --> 01:00:50,070
and want to come the line last hundreds 
of years,

1467
01:00:50,370 --> 01:00:54,300
they could never legally come like the 
conditions for legal immigration.

1468
01:00:54,301 --> 01:00:56,640
So they really all four,
if you are a low skill worker,

1469
01:00:56,910 --> 01:00:57,743
it's pretty much limited to having a 
blood relative already the US or 

1470
01:01:00,541 --> 01:01:02,190
marriage,
right?

1471
01:01:02,220 --> 01:01:02,640
Uh,
then,

1472
01:01:02,640 --> 01:01:03,950
you know,
there's a couple other way on,

1473
01:01:03,951 --> 01:01:06,780
a couple of other ways of doing it,
but those are extraordinarily rare.

1474
01:01:07,050 --> 01:01:09,240
So for most people in Third World Right 
now,

1475
01:01:09,241 --> 01:01:10,074
there is no possibility they'll ever,
they will ever be admitted no matter 

1476
01:01:12,181 --> 01:01:13,440
what.
Right?

1477
01:01:13,470 --> 01:01:14,640
And in,
to me it's like,

1478
01:01:14,641 --> 01:01:15,474
well,
why is it that because the person chose 

1479
01:01:17,311 --> 01:01:19,230
the wrong parents,
they were born in the wrong country,

1480
01:01:19,231 --> 01:01:20,064
that they have to be stuck living in 
Haiti their whole life and he and you 

1481
01:01:22,860 --> 01:01:23,693
know,
so people can very easily see the 

1482
01:01:24,421 --> 01:01:26,340
injustice saying because someone is born
black,

1483
01:01:26,610 --> 01:01:29,970
you are stuck living in black areas of 
black areas of the United States and you

1484
01:01:29,971 --> 01:01:32,450
can only be a janitor.
You can only go and,

1485
01:01:32,590 --> 01:01:34,120
and we're uh,
and uh,

1486
01:01:34,250 --> 01:01:36,540
you can,
you can only work as a porter on a train

1487
01:01:36,541 --> 01:01:38,310
or something like that.
And it's like,

1488
01:01:38,311 --> 01:01:39,144
why is it that he has to be treated 
differently just because he chose the 

1489
01:01:41,071 --> 01:01:43,070
wrong parents?
And to me this,

1490
01:01:43,100 --> 01:01:45,100
this argument is a very powerful one.
And St.

1491
01:01:45,210 --> 01:01:46,043
Well,
how is that different from choosing to 

1492
01:01:47,401 --> 01:01:48,660
have Haitian parents?
Of course,

1493
01:01:48,661 --> 01:01:49,494
the point is no one chooses parents.
You're just be all yell like it's 

1494
01:01:51,361 --> 01:01:52,800
something that had happened before you 
were born.

1495
01:01:52,801 --> 01:01:56,550
Why is it that a person,
if you can go and find a way,

1496
01:01:56,570 --> 01:01:57,403
a will,
a willing landlord find a willing 

1497
01:01:58,741 --> 01:01:59,574
employer,
why can't you say yes to those jobs and 

1498
01:02:01,051 --> 01:02:02,130
come and live here and work here we are.

1499
01:02:02,730 --> 01:02:04,900
So would there be an inherent problem 
that if,

1500
01:02:04,960 --> 01:02:05,793
okay,
you let all these people in now they're 

1501
01:02:07,121 --> 01:02:09,940
not citizens per se,
so they don't have the right to vote,

1502
01:02:10,180 --> 01:02:11,800
but they're here,
they're using our economy,

1503
01:02:11,801 --> 01:02:13,510
they're contributing to our economy,
all that.

1504
01:02:13,540 --> 01:02:14,373
All the good stuff that you said that 
eventually we could get a situation 

1505
01:02:17,021 --> 01:02:20,160
where you might have parody of the 
amount of people

1506
01:02:20,280 --> 01:02:21,113
that are voting and the people that are 
living here that seems like it could 

1507
01:02:23,611 --> 01:02:25,080
become a problem.
Right?

1508
01:02:25,530 --> 01:02:26,363
So I mean again,
I would say it's not clear why they are 

1509
01:02:28,950 --> 01:02:31,230
not clear why that's a problem.
Me and like one of the main things about

1510
01:02:31,231 --> 01:02:32,910
immigrants as they tend to be a 
political.

1511
01:02:33,330 --> 01:02:36,540
So when you moved to a new country 
normally like your concerns are,

1512
01:02:36,541 --> 01:02:38,300
I got to find a good place to live.
I gotta go,

1513
01:02:38,301 --> 01:02:40,440
I gotta go and get a job,
take care of my kids,

1514
01:02:40,770 --> 01:02:44,160
and getting involved in the politics of 
the country is usually the last thing on

1515
01:02:44,161 --> 01:02:45,350
people's minds when they,
when they first,

1516
01:02:45,390 --> 01:02:46,223
when they first come.
I mean one of the strangest complaints 

1517
01:02:48,541 --> 01:02:50,060
about immigrants to me is that they have
low,

1518
01:02:50,080 --> 01:02:52,000
low,
low voting rates and I say,

1519
01:02:52,001 --> 01:02:52,750
well,
you know,

1520
01:02:52,750 --> 01:02:53,310
some.
I have some.

1521
01:02:53,310 --> 01:02:54,143
I think I've heard people say,
well first they got the wrong way and 

1522
01:02:55,201 --> 01:02:55,980
second of all they don't vote.

1523
01:02:55,980 --> 01:02:58,650
It's like you pick one of the complaints
at least.

1524
01:02:59,330 --> 01:03:03,540
So I'm yelling in terms of what the,
what their kids will do.

1525
01:03:03,810 --> 01:03:05,700
So again,
so on your under current US law,

1526
01:03:05,701 --> 01:03:07,110
there's birthright citizenship.
So their kid,

1527
01:03:07,111 --> 01:03:09,150
their kids would be alive.
Say there is.

1528
01:03:09,420 --> 01:03:13,710
United States has a long tradition of 
assimilating the children of immigrants.

1529
01:03:13,711 --> 01:03:14,131
It is.
Well,

1530
01:03:14,131 --> 01:03:18,690
it's worked very well for a rev American
history and people often think,

1531
01:03:18,691 --> 01:03:19,524
well yeah,
it worked back then back when we really 

1532
01:03:20,551 --> 01:03:22,620
tried to assimilate them,
but it doesn't work anymore.

1533
01:03:22,790 --> 01:03:24,840
Where I can say is for the things that 
we measure,

1534
01:03:25,140 --> 01:03:29,220
things are the things are as good now as
they were in the Ellis island days.

1535
01:03:29,221 --> 01:03:31,170
So especially for light,
for language competence,

1536
01:03:31,590 --> 01:03:32,423
it was never through.
We have something special here in 

1537
01:03:33,991 --> 01:03:36,120
America that they don't have in Europe.
So for example,

1538
01:03:36,121 --> 01:03:37,790
I,
I agree with you there.

1539
01:03:37,930 --> 01:03:38,763
I think there's a lot of evidence of it 
that people still do assimilate more 

1540
01:03:41,821 --> 01:03:42,654
here,
but where Europe is having a problem 

1541
01:03:43,891 --> 01:03:44,724
with assimilation,
which is a culture problem and that's 

1542
01:03:46,381 --> 01:03:47,214
different,
right?

1543
01:03:47,340 --> 01:03:48,540
Right.
So two things.

1544
01:03:48,690 --> 01:03:49,523
First thing is I'd say that a lot of the
problems that people talk about are 

1545
01:03:52,021 --> 01:03:52,854
primarily problems on television.
So there's an enormous amount of 

1546
01:03:55,030 --> 01:03:57,600
simulation simulation going in Europe,
but that's not TV.

1547
01:03:57,750 --> 01:03:59,810
You don't go and have a TV show saying 
you know,

1548
01:04:00,510 --> 01:04:01,343
enormous number of Pakistanis now like 
soccer and root for Manchester United 

1549
01:04:04,621 --> 01:04:08,400
and speak with British accents and had 
British jobs and do regular stuff.

1550
01:04:08,640 --> 01:04:09,473
That's not a story.
Whereas you'll hear is here's a 

1551
01:04:11,701 --> 01:04:12,534
neighborhood is a no go area.
Where were the regular British police 

1552
01:04:15,031 --> 01:04:17,790
dare not travel for fear of what might 
happen to them.

1553
01:04:17,791 --> 01:04:18,910
Sharia law,
my kid,

1554
01:04:18,911 --> 01:04:19,744
I'm gonna.
Come on at any moment the seminar might 

1555
01:04:20,911 --> 01:04:21,360
come out.

1556
01:04:21,360 --> 01:04:22,770
That's a story.
All right.

1557
01:04:22,771 --> 01:04:27,510
So first step is always to separate 
scary stories from Cisco reality.

1558
01:04:27,511 --> 01:04:30,870
And what I say is it is true that Europe
does a worse job of getting assimilation

1559
01:04:30,940 --> 01:04:33,080
of the US.
They still have a lot of assimilation.

1560
01:04:33,090 --> 01:04:34,740
I remember the,
like the last time I was in Paris,

1561
01:04:34,970 --> 01:04:35,803
I was just amazed at all these 
simulation that I saw at his work and 

1562
01:04:37,460 --> 01:04:40,050
walking downtown and seeing people from 
all over the world,

1563
01:04:40,051 --> 01:04:41,980
but they're looking and acting French 
now they,

1564
01:04:41,981 --> 01:04:44,040
they're smoking cigarettes in a French 
way.

1565
01:04:44,250 --> 01:04:46,060
It was like wow,
she's drinking.

1566
01:04:47,390 --> 01:04:48,630
Right?
And it's like wow,

1567
01:04:48,631 --> 01:04:50,910
that guy looks like he's from,
from,

1568
01:04:51,070 --> 01:04:53,160
from,
from Chad or something like that.

1569
01:04:53,161 --> 01:04:54,100
But,
but he's,

1570
01:04:54,120 --> 01:04:55,230
you know,
he has like the turtle neck.

1571
01:04:55,231 --> 01:04:55,741
So I mean like,
you know,

1572
01:04:55,741 --> 01:04:58,490
like you actually see a lot of 
assimilation on.

1573
01:04:58,491 --> 01:04:59,850
Yeah,
I was truly have blessing simulation.

1574
01:04:59,850 --> 01:05:01,670
But they're a,
you're saying like,

1575
01:05:01,710 --> 01:05:02,543
is there something special that we have?
So there's nothing special we have is a 

1576
01:05:05,071 --> 01:05:07,800
more restrictive welfare states so you 
know,

1577
01:05:07,840 --> 01:05:09,070
so Europeans,
you know,

1578
01:05:09,071 --> 01:05:10,220
so again,
it varies a lot by country.

1579
01:05:10,221 --> 01:05:11,880
It's important important to it to 
realize that.

1580
01:05:11,881 --> 01:05:12,714
But you're being.
Henry's in general do have much more 

1581
01:05:14,731 --> 01:05:15,564
expensive welfare states especially to 
make it easier be on welfare for your 

1582
01:05:17,981 --> 01:05:18,850
entire life.
Right?

1583
01:05:19,120 --> 01:05:19,953
And I think this does,
this does great harm to their 

1584
01:05:21,741 --> 01:05:22,574
assimilation because one of the best 
ways of assimilating is to go to a job 

1585
01:05:25,841 --> 01:05:29,020
and to go in or interact from Po with 
people that aren't from your culture.

1586
01:05:29,230 --> 01:05:30,360
You know,
even if you know,

1587
01:05:30,370 --> 01:05:32,500
of course a lot of the workers won't be 
even if all the workers,

1588
01:05:32,501 --> 01:05:33,770
if you go in and work in a,
in a,

1589
01:05:33,771 --> 01:05:34,604
in a chatty and restaurant,
even then a lot of your customers won't 

1590
01:05:36,521 --> 01:05:37,150
be from Chad.

1591
01:05:37,150 --> 01:05:39,340
And so you will get to know them,
you'll interact with them.

1592
01:05:39,680 --> 01:05:41,590
Of course you need to go and let you 
learn the language.

1593
01:05:41,591 --> 01:05:42,424
But also you get to know people.
And so this is the kind of assimilation 

1594
01:05:46,030 --> 01:05:48,370
that has been greatly undermined by 
your,

1595
01:05:48,371 --> 01:05:50,000
by European welfare states.
Again,

1596
01:05:50,020 --> 01:05:52,270
it's important to realize that there's 
actually two kinds of things going on.

1597
01:05:52,271 --> 01:05:54,070
One of them is a lot of free government 
money.

1598
01:05:54,310 --> 01:05:58,360
Another one is labor market regulations 
that raised the price of labor that make

1599
01:05:58,361 --> 01:06:00,970
it hard to get a job.
And he put those two things together.

1600
01:06:00,971 --> 01:06:01,804
That's when you have a recipe for people
living their whole living their life on 

1601
01:06:04,901 --> 01:06:05,381
it.
So again,

1602
01:06:05,381 --> 01:06:06,340
it's.
So you'd say,

1603
01:06:06,341 --> 01:06:08,560
well maybe they'll.
They might like to get a job,

1604
01:06:08,561 --> 01:06:09,394
but if it's really hard to get a job 
because regulation and you get enough 

1605
01:06:11,981 --> 01:06:14,980
money to stay alive,
that's where you are likely to say,

1606
01:06:14,981 --> 01:06:15,880
fine,
screw it.

1607
01:06:15,881 --> 01:06:16,714
I'm just going to go and live in my 
ghetto and I won't and I'll never even 

1608
01:06:19,151 --> 01:06:21,640
learned French and it's going to stay 
here and I'm going to be bitter.

1609
01:06:21,840 --> 01:06:24,300
So people think that those things are at
odds with each other.

1610
01:06:24,301 --> 01:06:26,220
Open borders and a welfare state in a 
way.

1611
01:06:26,550 --> 01:06:28,140
But basically you're saying if you,
if,

1612
01:06:28,410 --> 01:06:32,130
if you open the border and you took away
the welfare state at the same time,

1613
01:06:32,420 --> 01:06:35,150
you actually forced assimilation.
Yes.

1614
01:06:35,151 --> 01:06:35,511
Yes.
So,

1615
01:06:35,511 --> 01:06:39,230
you know,
so you're not literally forced to create

1616
01:06:39,350 --> 01:06:40,670
conditions,
but the current system,

1617
01:06:41,030 --> 01:06:43,730
especially in Europe has heavily 
subsidizing not assimilation.

1618
01:06:44,270 --> 01:06:45,103
Right.
And I think that's a mistake and you 

1619
01:06:46,001 --> 01:06:46,834
get,
I think it's a case where people so 

1620
01:06:48,111 --> 01:06:52,880
naturally scapegoat immigrants for the 
problem when you didn't say,

1621
01:06:52,881 --> 01:06:53,714
well,
we have some really crummy laws which 

1622
01:06:55,161 --> 01:06:57,620
actually would lead soil a lot of people
to go.

1623
01:06:57,621 --> 01:06:58,454
And of course plenty of people who are 
native born free France who go about 

1624
01:07:01,250 --> 01:07:01,940
who,
uh,

1625
01:07:01,940 --> 01:07:04,880
have their ancestors were galls.
Uh,

1626
01:07:04,881 --> 01:07:05,714
you know,
plenty of people like this are also in 

1627
01:07:06,621 --> 01:07:10,160
France sitting around being supported by
the welfare state for their entire life.

1628
01:07:10,430 --> 01:07:11,151
Which again,
you know,

1629
01:07:11,151 --> 01:07:12,350
so important.
Remember,

1630
01:07:12,351 --> 01:07:13,184
it's not just people being lazy,
it's also being very discouraged that 

1631
01:07:16,461 --> 01:07:18,290
the regulations make it so hard to get a
job.

1632
01:07:18,430 --> 01:07:19,470
Yeah.
So I,

1633
01:07:19,560 --> 01:07:23,530
I get your point a about the,
you know,

1634
01:07:23,531 --> 01:07:24,364
forcing once people are here and then we
put them on this and then they're sort 

1635
01:07:27,371 --> 01:07:30,760
of stuck in that creates resentment and 
then people in present them for that and

1636
01:07:30,761 --> 01:07:32,260
all that stuff.
Um,

1637
01:07:32,650 --> 01:07:34,430
what about the culture part of it that 
there's,

1638
01:07:34,690 --> 01:07:37,660
we do have to acknowledge that cultures 
are different,

1639
01:07:37,661 --> 01:07:40,720
that they respect different things.
They honor different things.

1640
01:07:40,721 --> 01:07:41,554
They not every culture is tolerant and 
that we could eventually start bringing 

1641
01:07:45,551 --> 01:07:48,640
in people who are intolerant of our 
freedoms.

1642
01:07:48,830 --> 01:07:49,663
Right?
Regardless of whether that's overblown 

1643
01:07:51,321 --> 01:07:52,640
on the news or not.
I get your point.

1644
01:07:52,641 --> 01:07:54,200
Yeah.
So I think it's overblown.

1645
01:07:54,201 --> 01:07:55,650
So I mean,
so again,

1646
01:07:55,700 --> 01:07:57,440
theoretically possible.
Yes.

1647
01:07:57,780 --> 01:07:59,470
Uh,
but um,

1648
01:07:59,480 --> 01:08:00,313
you know,
here's the striking thing all over the 

1649
01:08:01,071 --> 01:08:02,720
world and the most progressive 
countries.

1650
01:08:02,721 --> 01:08:06,230
What is it that they feel about culture 
that you feel like America is destroying

1651
01:08:06,231 --> 01:08:07,730
their culture?
So in Iran,

1652
01:08:07,731 --> 01:08:11,390
they've long had this word they call 
West toxification,

1653
01:08:11,870 --> 01:08:13,190
west toxification.
It's the idea.

1654
01:08:13,191 --> 01:08:16,060
There's all these horrible western ideas
flooding into Iran,

1655
01:08:16,100 --> 01:08:18,350
alienating your child read and 
destroying Islam.

1656
01:08:18,650 --> 01:08:19,483
And here's why I say they're right.
Because when like La Western culture is 

1657
01:08:23,421 --> 01:08:25,550
awesome,
people around the world love it,

1658
01:08:25,551 --> 01:08:26,384
especially young people and if 
governments around the world want to 

1659
01:08:28,371 --> 01:08:29,204
stop it,
they have to do the resort to extreme 

1660
01:08:30,681 --> 01:08:32,720
measures in order to keep it out.
Right.

1661
01:08:32,721 --> 01:08:33,554
And what does immigration do at weddings
and brings the people who brings people 

1662
01:08:36,620 --> 01:08:37,453
straight to the western culture where 
their governments can no longer get 

1663
01:08:39,321 --> 01:08:40,580
between them and the culture.

1664
01:08:40,790 --> 01:08:43,160
And the main thing that happens is that 
people go native,

1665
01:08:43,640 --> 01:08:44,300
right?
So again,

1666
01:08:44,300 --> 01:08:45,170
they may,
they also get,

1667
01:08:45,171 --> 01:08:47,660
there's always some people on the news 
who were refusing to do it,

1668
01:08:47,661 --> 01:08:50,080
but there are,
but there is a much larger group.

1669
01:08:50,100 --> 01:08:52,800
People who moved to the West and they 
made,

1670
01:08:52,820 --> 01:08:53,653
you know,
they may pay lip service to their home 

1671
01:08:55,761 --> 01:08:56,594
culture,
but they actually go and assimilate to 

1672
01:08:58,341 --> 01:09:00,480
the new culture.
Meaning here's my favorite test.

1673
01:09:00,481 --> 01:09:03,260
If you want to go and find out how much 
a simulation is there,

1674
01:09:03,261 --> 01:09:07,020
talk to any immigrant parents and what 
will they tell you to immigrant parents.

1675
01:09:07,021 --> 01:09:07,970
So they are,
they say,

1676
01:09:08,210 --> 01:09:09,580
Oh yeah,
my kid loves us,

1677
01:09:09,590 --> 01:09:12,140
loves Romanian culture.
All he thinks about is Romania.

1678
01:09:12,141 --> 01:09:13,010
Romania,
Romania,

1679
01:09:13,011 --> 01:09:15,710
all day being remaining is so central to
his life.

1680
01:09:15,711 --> 01:09:16,860
No.
What,

1681
01:09:17,050 --> 01:09:17,450
what,
what,

1682
01:09:17,450 --> 01:09:18,150
what do you know?
So yeah,

1683
01:09:18,150 --> 01:09:19,550
my wife,
my wife is from a radio.

1684
01:09:19,550 --> 01:09:23,000
So the normal thing for your Manian 
immigrant parents,

1685
01:09:23,001 --> 01:09:25,460
it's like almost any immigrant parents 
is to say,

1686
01:09:25,730 --> 01:09:28,610
I thought we could preserve our culture,
but my kid just doesn't care about it.

1687
01:09:28,820 --> 01:09:29,653
I talked to my kid and Romanian and they
answer me back in English and my 

1688
01:09:32,691 --> 01:09:35,600
grandkids don't speak a word Romania and
they have no interest in this stuff.

1689
01:09:36,020 --> 01:09:37,610
Right.
And again to say over the old video,

1690
01:09:37,611 --> 01:09:41,110
so I'll just do basically Americanism 
where western is in.

1691
01:09:41,111 --> 01:09:42,610
Will actually wait.
Yes.

1692
01:09:42,611 --> 01:09:43,890
Yes.
So I.

1693
01:09:43,890 --> 01:09:48,530
So I have a blog post called Western 
civilization is a hardy weed and says,

1694
01:09:48,531 --> 01:09:48,831
look,
you know,

1695
01:09:48,831 --> 01:09:49,664
I believe in Western civilization much 
more than most of the people who say 

1696
01:09:52,281 --> 01:09:55,940
they defend it because I think we're 
gonna I think we are winning right now.

1697
01:09:56,300 --> 01:09:58,880
And I think with open borders we will 
win sooner,

1698
01:09:59,300 --> 01:09:59,900
right?
We'll,

1699
01:09:59,900 --> 01:10:02,630
uh,
and so many of this is the kind of thing

1700
01:10:02,631 --> 01:10:04,790
where someone,
someone watching it in rand might say,

1701
01:10:04,791 --> 01:10:08,150
ah,
he knew Kaplan had a plot by plot.

1702
01:10:08,150 --> 01:10:09,340
So yes,
I mean some,

1703
01:10:09,350 --> 01:10:13,250
I do think that Western civilization is 
the better civilization in most ways.

1704
01:10:13,550 --> 01:10:14,383
I'm always happy to learn from other 
cultures and to have a cosmopolitan 

1705
01:10:17,481 --> 01:10:20,150
combination of all of the best things.
But nevertheless,

1706
01:10:20,151 --> 01:10:22,970
I think that when we compile all of the 
best things in the world,

1707
01:10:22,971 --> 01:10:25,940
I think 80 percent of the stuff is going
to come from Western civilization.

1708
01:10:26,360 --> 01:10:27,193
Uh,
so maybe we'll pick up the work ethic 

1709
01:10:27,951 --> 01:10:31,100
from China or something like that.
And we revitalized the work ethic.

1710
01:10:31,101 --> 01:10:33,140
So I think they've,
they've got something to offer there.

1711
01:10:33,470 --> 01:10:35,290
But what do like that about?
So again,

1712
01:10:35,350 --> 01:10:36,183
my plan is to go and spread Western 
civilization more quickly and 

1713
01:10:39,441 --> 01:10:42,020
effectively through immigration.
Right?

1714
01:10:42,050 --> 01:10:43,940
And I think I'd say it is working right 
here,

1715
01:10:43,941 --> 01:10:46,700
right now.
I get to say like even Los Angeles where

1716
01:10:46,701 --> 01:10:48,890
people look around and say,
I don't see people assimilating.

1717
01:10:49,220 --> 01:10:50,660
You always look at,
well,

1718
01:10:50,661 --> 01:10:52,960
what is the generation of the immigrants
it?

1719
01:10:52,980 --> 01:10:55,610
It's a first generation immigrant.
Then sure they have an assemble aided.

1720
01:10:55,820 --> 01:10:56,653
They never did.
It was never true that first generation 

1721
01:10:59,481 --> 01:11:01,350
immigrants became fluent in English if 
they can't,

1722
01:11:01,360 --> 01:11:02,990
if they arrived in their twenties.
Right,

1723
01:11:03,070 --> 01:11:04,640
right.
They always had trouble.

1724
01:11:04,641 --> 01:11:05,474
They always stuck to the old ways.
Assimilation is always worked on the 

1725
01:11:08,151 --> 01:11:08,984
second generation.
If you go and talk to a second 

1726
01:11:10,821 --> 01:11:12,650
generation,
Mexican American in La,

1727
01:11:12,860 --> 01:11:15,540
the automobile speak fluent in English 
or 90 percent.

1728
01:11:15,990 --> 01:11:19,860
Right?
All y'all so and even for even like kids

1729
01:11:19,861 --> 01:11:21,960
who were first generation,
as long as they came with their young,

1730
01:11:21,961 --> 01:11:24,920
so fluent English by far the norm.
So again,

1731
01:11:24,930 --> 01:11:25,900
I just been going,
going,

1732
01:11:26,110 --> 01:11:28,200
going,
been going over this data so we can like

1733
01:11:28,201 --> 01:11:29,034
the main reason why we feel like 
Hispanic immigrants aren't assimilating 

1734
01:11:31,711 --> 01:11:32,544
and just because in the past it was 
normal to have like one generation wave 

1735
01:11:35,341 --> 01:11:36,174
of Germans and then it stopped.
One generation wave of Swedes are 

1736
01:11:38,791 --> 01:11:39,624
Italians and then it stopped.
So then in a couple generations there's 

1737
01:11:41,581 --> 01:11:44,700
no longer any Italian.
The Italians in America who don't,

1738
01:11:44,701 --> 01:11:45,534
who don't speak English,
but it's not because the first 

1739
01:11:46,921 --> 01:11:47,754
generation learned English,
it's because the first generation died 

1740
01:11:49,801 --> 01:11:51,960
and Italian stop coming.
So you know,

1741
01:11:51,961 --> 01:11:53,730
I don't again,
I don't see that again,

1742
01:11:53,731 --> 01:11:55,740
like when you understand what a 
simulation is about,

1743
01:11:55,741 --> 01:11:56,574
it's about changing.
The second generation is still going on 

1744
01:11:58,920 --> 01:11:59,753
at enormous levels.
So we are already the sizing Latin 

1745
01:12:02,910 --> 01:12:03,530
America right now.

1746
01:12:03,530 --> 01:12:04,363
Yeah.
The wave part of this is interesting 

1747
01:12:05,181 --> 01:12:06,014
because I think when people talk about 
the Ellis island thing and they think 

1748
01:12:08,631 --> 01:12:09,520
of,
you know,

1749
01:12:09,521 --> 01:12:12,480
like the lower east side of Brooklyn in 
New York City,

1750
01:12:12,760 --> 01:12:13,593
Brooklyn,
you know from 60 years ago when all 

1751
01:12:15,111 --> 01:12:20,111
these Irish and German and Jews and all 
these other people came that yeah,

1752
01:12:20,151 --> 01:12:23,000
it was that first generation that had,
that worked incredibly hard,

1753
01:12:23,001 --> 01:12:25,600
barely spoken language,
lived more sheltered and then.

1754
01:12:25,680 --> 01:12:26,513
And then the rest of what you said 
basically happened and they move 

1755
01:12:28,131 --> 01:12:29,060
throughout the face.
All right,

1756
01:12:29,061 --> 01:12:31,070
let's do one more thing before I let you
go.

1757
01:12:31,260 --> 01:12:34,900
Passive,
isn't that my policy on this by the way?

1758
01:12:34,940 --> 01:12:36,920
Did Not look at the notes once,
which is a good interview.

1759
01:12:36,960 --> 01:12:37,790
Alright.
Uh,

1760
01:12:37,790 --> 01:12:38,623
so you've already done well passivism my
particular policy on this is that I 

1761
01:12:42,501 --> 01:12:44,870
believe in a strong defense basically so
that we don't have to use it.

1762
01:12:44,990 --> 01:12:45,823
I don't want to nation build,
I don't think we should be all over the 

1763
01:12:47,271 --> 01:12:48,104
place creating empires and all that,
but I do believe you need a strong 

1764
01:12:50,870 --> 01:12:52,880
defense so that people won't mess with 
you.

1765
01:12:52,970 --> 01:12:54,320
Yeah.
So how do you like that?

1766
01:12:54,380 --> 01:12:55,170
Yeah.
Well,

1767
01:12:55,170 --> 01:12:56,850
so if you want peace,
prepare for war anyhow,

1768
01:12:56,910 --> 01:12:58,020
ancient,
ancient Roman saying.

1769
01:12:58,470 --> 01:13:00,090
Um,
so,

1770
01:13:00,360 --> 01:13:01,193
uh,
just so we just want to sit back and 

1771
01:13:01,801 --> 01:13:02,401
say,
you said what are you?

1772
01:13:02,401 --> 01:13:04,500
Oh,
so what is passivism and then what's the

1773
01:13:04,501 --> 01:13:05,730
art?
What is the argument for it?

1774
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:07,290
So again,
my passion is my don't.

1775
01:13:07,291 --> 01:13:08,124
I don't mean never resisting violence.
So I don't mean that if someone is 

1776
01:13:11,251 --> 01:13:13,650
coming in with an ax you shouldn't fight
back or anything like that.

1777
01:13:14,040 --> 01:13:15,540
Um,
so and so,

1778
01:13:15,541 --> 01:13:16,374
and I'll rather,
what I mean by passivism is opposition 

1779
01:13:19,021 --> 01:13:20,250
to war,
right?

1780
01:13:20,251 --> 01:13:23,670
And so they'll stay organized,
violence organized by governments.

1781
01:13:23,850 --> 01:13:25,170
And again,
so what exactly,

1782
01:13:25,200 --> 01:13:26,033
how exactly is that different in any of 
the answer is that war is actually 

1783
01:13:29,430 --> 01:13:30,263
almost never defensive in the sense that
all of them were almost always involves 

1784
01:13:33,751 --> 01:13:38,220
either deliberately murdering or 
recklessly killing innocent people.

1785
01:13:38,790 --> 01:13:39,090
Right?

1786
01:13:39,090 --> 01:13:39,923
So this is really like,
isn't it theoretically possible that it 

1787
01:13:41,791 --> 01:13:42,930
wouldn't be that way?
Sure.

1788
01:13:43,230 --> 01:13:44,063
But in practice,
anytime you fight any kind of a serious 

1789
01:13:45,961 --> 01:13:46,794
war,
you either wind up deliberately 

1790
01:13:47,881 --> 01:13:49,950
murdering,
murdering a whole bunch of civilians,

1791
01:13:50,250 --> 01:13:51,083
or you wind up recklessly endangering 
them where you go when you drop a bomb 

1792
01:13:53,880 --> 01:13:54,713
in the general vicinity of a whole bunch
of civilians and you killed them as 

1793
01:13:56,790 --> 01:13:58,320
collateral damage.
What's the big deal?

1794
01:13:58,580 --> 01:14:00,960
You know,
if the police thought crime the same way

1795
01:14:00,961 --> 01:14:03,090
that the US government wages,
wages,

1796
01:14:03,091 --> 01:14:06,840
war on the USB,
oh this would be way bigger protest than

1797
01:14:06,841 --> 01:14:09,260
anything that we're getting right now 
because you need to go in.

1798
01:14:09,420 --> 01:14:11,520
So I would say you're now,
I,

1799
01:14:11,640 --> 01:14:12,473
so I mean like so literally a minimum 
just seems to me like there is some 

1800
01:14:14,711 --> 01:14:17,500
moral problem with war.
So which again is glossed over by the,

1801
01:14:17,510 --> 01:14:17,960
uh,
yeah,

1802
01:14:17,960 --> 01:14:18,360
well,
it's,

1803
01:14:18,360 --> 01:14:19,780
we're just defending ourselves.

1804
01:14:20,140 --> 01:14:22,020
We'll normally,
you're defending yourself by sales,

1805
01:14:22,030 --> 01:14:24,460
by murdering a bunch of innocent people.
So,

1806
01:14:24,461 --> 01:14:25,390
you know,
at first glance,

1807
01:14:25,391 --> 01:14:28,510
this seems like it's a problem.
People often want to say no,

1808
01:14:28,511 --> 01:14:29,344
there's no innocence on the other side.
It's like there's no innocent babies in 

1809
01:14:32,141 --> 01:14:32,974
the other country.
There's no one who has never done 

1810
01:14:34,271 --> 01:14:35,104
anything.
It seems like this is a pretty flimsy 

1811
01:14:36,491 --> 01:14:38,410
defense.
And then there's also the,

1812
01:14:38,411 --> 01:14:39,244
well anyone we kill is totally on the 
hands of the bad guys that we're 

1813
01:14:42,551 --> 01:14:44,260
fighting against.
It's like,

1814
01:14:44,330 --> 01:14:45,163
so really.
So like what if you went in like bomb 

1815
01:14:47,621 --> 01:14:52,090
people in the neighboring country with 
that beyond the hands of the bad guys to

1816
01:14:52,300 --> 01:14:54,580
like,
why exactly is it that like,

1817
01:14:54,581 --> 01:14:57,610
is there some limit to what you can 
blame on the bad guys?

1818
01:14:57,611 --> 01:14:58,444
I mean,
it's one thing if you've got someone 

1819
01:14:59,621 --> 01:15:02,140
holding a hostage right there and 
they're shooting.

1820
01:15:02,380 --> 01:15:04,720
But again,
what if say there's just a bunch of,

1821
01:15:04,750 --> 01:15:06,850
there's a school next to the next to a 
criminal.

1822
01:15:06,851 --> 01:15:08,650
Can you go and bomb the school?
Because.

1823
01:15:08,790 --> 01:15:09,160
Well,
it's,

1824
01:15:09,160 --> 01:15:10,330
that's on him,
you know,

1825
01:15:10,331 --> 01:15:12,220
the fact that we killed that to all the 
kids in that school,

1826
01:15:12,221 --> 01:15:14,250
like the light sad,
but you know,

1827
01:15:14,320 --> 01:15:15,840
we were just trying to get that one 
murderer St.

1828
01:15:15,910 --> 01:15:16,743
well,
anything that seems like a very flimsy 

1829
01:15:18,611 --> 01:15:19,444
defense now again.
So like I am actually never an 

1830
01:15:22,040 --> 01:15:23,480
absolutist.
Uh,

1831
01:15:23,540 --> 01:15:24,960
so I'm always willing to say,
right,

1832
01:15:24,970 --> 01:15:28,420
maybe we have to do this terrible thing 
for the greater good.

1833
01:15:28,780 --> 01:15:29,613
Right.
So I always want to be open to that 

1834
01:15:30,401 --> 01:15:32,200
argument,
but that's where I say,

1835
01:15:32,201 --> 01:15:33,034
all right,
well let's actually go and carefully 

1836
01:15:34,511 --> 01:15:36,610
look at how much,
how,

1837
01:15:36,790 --> 01:15:39,620
how great is this good and how certain 
can you really be the audits.

1838
01:15:40,410 --> 01:15:41,740
So,
uh,

1839
01:15:41,910 --> 01:15:43,140
you know,
so then you know,

1840
01:15:43,860 --> 01:15:44,620
just to back up.

1841
01:15:44,620 --> 01:15:46,360
So you know,
so anyway,

1842
01:15:46,361 --> 01:15:47,194
so like you know,
the,

1843
01:15:47,690 --> 01:15:48,523
you know,
the argument for bassmans first APP is 

1844
01:15:49,361 --> 01:15:53,410
just accepting the harsh reality.
That war is not really defensive.

1845
01:15:53,411 --> 01:15:58,270
It does involve actually going and 
murdering or at least man slaughtering a

1846
01:15:58,271 --> 01:15:59,104
whole lot of innocent people.
And like no matter the nicest country 

1847
01:16:01,310 --> 01:16:01,901
wages,
war,

1848
01:16:01,901 --> 01:16:02,734
the most careful one does this,
that with modern weaponry will be hard 

1849
01:16:05,771 --> 01:16:06,840
to do otherwise.
Can that,

1850
01:16:06,880 --> 01:16:08,560
can that be in and of itself moral 
though,

1851
01:16:08,561 --> 01:16:11,980
like so in case in the case of World War
II where we weren't our homeland,

1852
01:16:11,981 --> 01:16:13,490
well Pearl Harbor,
but our,

1853
01:16:13,510 --> 01:16:16,720
our homeland wasn't threatened by the 
Nazis per se,

1854
01:16:17,140 --> 01:16:19,960
by we killed a lot of people and the 
allies firebombed,

1855
01:16:19,961 --> 01:16:22,930
Dresden and all that.
But we also have been saved a lot.

1856
01:16:23,650 --> 01:16:24,430
Again,
that's one of the like.

1857
01:16:24,430 --> 01:16:26,630
So that's that next step.
But again,

1858
01:16:26,700 --> 01:16:27,533
first step is just accepting that the,
that the United States government 

1859
01:16:29,351 --> 01:16:31,080
murdered a lot of innocent key.

1860
01:16:31,090 --> 01:16:31,923
A lot of Sun innocent people.
They murdered in the United States 

1861
01:16:33,131 --> 01:16:34,990
government murdered children,
right?

1862
01:16:34,991 --> 01:16:37,450
They did the kind of thing that we 
attack terrorists for,

1863
01:16:37,451 --> 01:16:38,284
which is like,
which is murdering a bunch of innocent 

1864
01:16:40,391 --> 01:16:42,580
people for the grill because you think 
it's for the greater good.

1865
01:16:42,940 --> 01:16:44,170
And again,
normally when we,

1866
01:16:44,180 --> 01:16:45,310
when we,
when we attacked it,

1867
01:16:45,311 --> 01:16:46,990
when we say terrorists are terrible 
people for this,

1868
01:16:47,230 --> 01:16:48,063
we don't have some big factual argument 
about how what they're doing isn't 

1869
01:16:49,691 --> 01:16:52,480
really for the greater good.
It's like you murdered innocent people.

1870
01:16:52,570 --> 01:16:54,610
That's a terrible thing to do,
right?

1871
01:16:54,611 --> 01:16:55,444
So you know,
it's just like there's at least a moral 

1872
01:16:57,671 --> 01:17:00,280
presumption against this,
which maybe it can be overcome again for

1873
01:17:00,281 --> 01:17:03,780
the greater good.
But that's where I say that ceos.

1874
01:17:03,790 --> 01:17:04,623
So there's this great philosophical 
example involving a doctor who's got 

1875
01:17:08,621 --> 01:17:10,970
five patients a week,
you need a different organ donation,

1876
01:17:11,180 --> 01:17:12,013
and then a guy walks by who happens to 
be perfectly healthy and the doctor 

1877
01:17:15,411 --> 01:17:19,400
thinks maybe I should go and murder that
guy at harvest his organs,

1878
01:17:19,520 --> 01:17:21,110
and then he searches and he has no 
family,

1879
01:17:21,111 --> 01:17:22,610
no one's really going to miss this guy.

1880
01:17:22,760 --> 01:17:25,370
I can save five lives by murdering one 
person.

1881
01:17:25,640 --> 01:17:27,380
Seems like a good idea.
All right.

1882
01:17:27,381 --> 01:17:29,750
Now people's normal reaction to this is 
horrible.

1883
01:17:29,751 --> 01:17:33,410
And the den.
And if you start brand new guy,

1884
01:17:33,460 --> 01:17:36,060
start ramping up the numbers.
Maybe it's a million people already,

1885
01:17:36,590 --> 01:17:39,440
but anyway,
at least that five to one ratio seems to

1886
01:17:39,441 --> 01:17:41,150
really bother people and say,
no,

1887
01:17:41,151 --> 01:17:44,240
you can't go and deliberately murdered a
person to save five other people.

1888
01:17:44,560 --> 01:17:46,610
All right,
so it is this.

1889
01:17:46,611 --> 01:17:49,430
It is this premise that I bring in,
in my case against war saying,

1890
01:17:49,431 --> 01:17:50,390
look,
all right,

1891
01:17:50,391 --> 01:17:53,270
now maybe that there's a,
there's a war for the greater good,

1892
01:17:53,271 --> 01:17:56,480
but are you actually getting something 
like this five to one ratio,

1893
01:17:57,080 --> 01:17:57,801
right?
And furthermore,

1894
01:17:57,801 --> 01:17:59,600
how confident can you really be?
And that's right.

1895
01:17:59,601 --> 01:18:02,540
Bring in the last body of evidence,
which is that people's predictions about

1896
01:18:02,541 --> 01:18:03,980
the results of war are terrible.

1897
01:18:04,520 --> 01:18:06,710
So again,
the whole idea of prediction is you have

1898
01:18:06,711 --> 01:18:07,544
to say what you think is gonna happen 
before it happens and then you look at 

1899
01:18:10,161 --> 01:18:12,470
what occurs and see how accurate your 
prediction was.

1900
01:18:13,040 --> 01:18:13,873
Alright?
So,

1901
01:18:14,030 --> 01:18:14,863
uh,
there is a fantastic political 

1902
01:18:16,011 --> 01:18:20,030
psychologist named Phil tetlock who ran 
a big experiment along these lines.

1903
01:18:20,031 --> 01:18:20,864
So in the 19 eighties he went and asked 
a bunch of foreign policy experts their 

1904
01:18:23,211 --> 01:18:24,044
predictions and then 20 years later came
back and weighed their predictions 

1905
01:18:27,351 --> 01:18:30,830
against the actual results and they did 
really badly.

1906
01:18:31,340 --> 01:18:32,173
Right?
And so this is experimental evidence on 

1907
01:18:33,531 --> 01:18:34,364
people's,
but people's ability to forecast the 

1908
01:18:35,631 --> 01:18:38,210
actual long run benefits of war are very
poor.

1909
01:18:38,730 --> 01:18:40,490
Of course we don't really need to do 
experiments.

1910
01:18:40,491 --> 01:18:44,000
We can just go to the views about what 
happened would have happened in Rwanda.

1911
01:18:44,001 --> 01:18:46,670
Rwanda were all sides are saying out of 
the trenches by Christmas.

1912
01:18:46,940 --> 01:18:49,790
No one is saying I think this will end 
in communist revolution.

1913
01:18:50,270 --> 01:18:53,540
And certainly no one was saying,
well I think the long run result of this

1914
01:18:53,541 --> 01:18:55,430
will be a communist regime in North 
Korea.

1915
01:18:55,431 --> 01:18:59,000
A country doesn't even exist right now.
And yet if you know your history,

1916
01:18:59,001 --> 01:19:02,330
that is what it costs.
What would that is the key events in why

1917
01:19:02,331 --> 01:19:03,164
there's communism North Korea.
So now if you snap these pieces 

1918
01:19:05,601 --> 01:19:06,434
together,
so moral presumption against more five 

1919
01:19:08,811 --> 01:19:12,140
to one ratio or something like that,
minimum in order for it to be justified.

1920
01:19:12,620 --> 01:19:15,050
And then finally,
great uncertainty about what the effects

1921
01:19:15,051 --> 01:19:15,884
of war are.
That's where I get my case for 

1922
01:19:17,301 --> 01:19:18,980
passivism.
It's like anytime there's a war,

1923
01:19:19,030 --> 01:19:21,500
anytime there is someone proposing more 
by accident.

1924
01:19:21,501 --> 01:19:23,810
All right.
So like first of all,

1925
01:19:23,811 --> 01:19:26,300
so he's even,
isn't even a plausible that the,

1926
01:19:26,301 --> 01:19:27,134
that you are going to say five times as 
many lives as you are going to murder 

1927
01:19:29,271 --> 01:19:30,390
here.
And,

1928
01:19:30,450 --> 01:19:31,283
and is it reasonable to be that 
confident given how bad most people's 

1929
01:19:33,561 --> 01:19:34,900
track records are?
Right.

1930
01:19:35,270 --> 01:19:39,110
And if you put that together that I say 
that for almost any actual war is really

1931
01:19:39,111 --> 01:19:40,820
hard to make the case and the case in 
his favor.

1932
01:19:40,900 --> 01:19:45,900
So let's say there were some terrorists 
in Tiawana firing rockets into San Diego

1933
01:19:47,051 --> 01:19:47,884
where you're writing in a couple of days
and they keep firing these rockets or 

1934
01:19:49,961 --> 01:19:53,950
they're sending people in to shoot 
people in San Diego or something.

1935
01:19:54,880 --> 01:19:57,280
You would be,
you would be for doing something.

1936
01:19:57,470 --> 01:19:58,303
Sure,
sure.

1937
01:19:58,390 --> 01:20:00,400
You're taking police action.
Absolutely.

1938
01:20:00,401 --> 01:20:02,530
Like normally it's actually not bombing 
Tijuana.

1939
01:20:02,850 --> 01:20:03,683
I mean,
I think that's a case where as long as 

1940
01:20:04,481 --> 01:20:05,314
they were Muslim terrorists and Ilana,
I don't think most Americans would 

1941
01:20:07,140 --> 01:20:07,973
bombing tijuana even if the Mexicans 
were floundering around and couldn't 

1942
01:20:10,381 --> 01:20:12,060
figure out what to do.
I don't.

1943
01:20:12,061 --> 01:20:14,370
They also,
as long as the Mexican said,

1944
01:20:14,640 --> 01:20:17,910
you can go and send in America,
American troops to deal with this,

1945
01:20:17,911 --> 01:20:18,744
but don't go bombing us.
Don't go machine gunning whole villages 

1946
01:20:20,881 --> 01:20:22,530
of people.
Also,

1947
01:20:22,590 --> 01:20:23,150
again,
some of you,

1948
01:20:23,150 --> 01:20:23,983
again,
so I've no objection to anything like 

1949
01:20:24,751 --> 01:20:27,150
that,
but anytime someone starts talking about

1950
01:20:27,151 --> 01:20:27,984
waging war with modern weaponry,
where you're going to start murdering a 

1951
01:20:30,510 --> 01:20:31,343
lover,
you like Bernie inevitably murder or 

1952
01:20:33,181 --> 01:20:34,650
manslaughter,
right?

1953
01:20:34,651 --> 01:20:35,700
Again,
salesforce and be murdered,

1954
01:20:35,701 --> 01:20:39,660
or you'd have to be trying to kill them.
Manslaughter is just when you recklessly

1955
01:20:39,661 --> 01:20:40,494
endanger them,
a buddy at anytime you're talking about 

1956
01:20:42,301 --> 01:20:42,870
something like that.

1957
01:20:42,870 --> 01:20:43,703
That's where my past,
this group is getting in the way and I 

1958
01:20:46,191 --> 01:20:47,024
think,
and this is another case where when 

1959
01:20:48,751 --> 01:20:50,550
someone fights award and ends really 
badly,

1960
01:20:50,910 --> 01:20:51,661
then it's like,
well,

1961
01:20:51,661 --> 01:20:52,494
what can you do?
But if someone opposes a war eventually 

1962
01:20:54,621 --> 01:20:55,290
badly,
it's like,

1963
01:20:55,290 --> 01:20:56,031
ah,
passive.

1964
01:20:56,031 --> 01:20:56,864
It's a terrible idea like this one,
but like you have caused all these 

1965
01:20:59,461 --> 01:21:00,820
problems,
you know,

1966
01:21:00,840 --> 01:21:01,830
so you know,
I would say,

1967
01:21:01,831 --> 01:21:02,340
look,
you know,

1968
01:21:02,340 --> 01:21:03,750
I think think it is a,
is a,

1969
01:21:03,760 --> 01:21:06,510
is a fair historical point to say almost
every,

1970
01:21:06,660 --> 01:21:07,493
almost every story and,
or anyone who knows any facts about the 

1971
01:21:09,220 --> 01:21:10,320
world and say,
look,

1972
01:21:10,580 --> 01:21:13,860
just would have been better if any one 
of the major powers to just rendered,

1973
01:21:14,640 --> 01:21:16,740
if any one of the major powers will 
robot it just said,

1974
01:21:16,741 --> 01:21:17,574
look,
we give in you when we'll do what you 

1975
01:21:18,871 --> 01:21:22,590
want and that would have prevented so 
many terrible things.

1976
01:21:22,590 --> 01:21:27,240
Most obviously world war and yet people.
And yet people will say,

1977
01:21:27,241 --> 01:21:28,920
well look,
passivism would've led to disaster world

1978
01:21:28,940 --> 01:21:29,960
war two,
if we'd been this,

1979
01:21:29,970 --> 01:21:30,803
it wouldn't.
There wouldn't have been in world war 

1980
01:21:30,991 --> 01:21:33,780
one.
So maybe we should get credit for that.

1981
01:21:34,230 --> 01:21:35,063
Right?
It's almost like the actions lead to 

1982
01:21:35,971 --> 01:21:38,010
other actions.
Actions lead to other actions.

1983
01:21:38,280 --> 01:21:39,240
Now again,
notice what I'm not.

1984
01:21:39,241 --> 01:21:41,920
I'm not claiming that we have like no 
clue at all about whether we're.

1985
01:21:41,930 --> 01:21:42,763
We'll do so.
So the uncertainty by itself doesn't 

1986
01:21:45,241 --> 01:21:46,074
really argue for or against war.
It's the uncertainty combined with this 

1987
01:21:48,331 --> 01:21:49,164
high threshold.
They're saying you've got to actually 

1988
01:21:50,941 --> 01:21:51,774
know that you're saving five times as 
many lives they're killing before we 

1989
01:21:53,821 --> 01:21:55,770
should even be thinking,
even be talking about this.

1990
01:21:55,980 --> 01:21:56,813
And that's where the uncertainty is hard
because it is a barrier to war because 

1991
01:22:00,950 --> 01:22:02,460
you like,
like saying it's a close call.

1992
01:22:02,461 --> 01:22:04,860
Well like say with Sandia passivism has 
all close calls,

1993
01:22:04,861 --> 01:22:05,694
go to peace.
You don't doubt fixe if it's a close 

1994
01:22:07,051 --> 01:22:09,210
call because you're murdering innocent 
people.

1995
01:22:09,211 --> 01:22:12,000
So there's a very high threshold 
responsibility.

1996
01:22:12,360 --> 01:22:12,751
Again,
you know,

1997
01:22:12,751 --> 01:22:16,560
so a higher even than the one of you for
spending taxpayer money,

1998
01:22:16,561 --> 01:22:18,540
you ought to know you're really doing 
something good with it.

1999
01:22:19,180 --> 01:22:20,170
Right?
Well,

2000
01:22:20,171 --> 01:22:21,004
I have thoroughly enjoyed this.
We barely got into half of what I was 

2001
01:22:24,551 --> 01:22:25,990
going to talk about where we're going to
do this again.

2002
01:22:25,991 --> 01:22:26,824
How about that?
Awesome.

2003
01:22:26,830 --> 01:22:27,351
Yeah,
that sounds great.

2004
01:22:27,351 --> 01:22:28,184
Yeah.
I really enjoyed this and I hope you 

2005
01:22:28,931 --> 01:22:32,230
guys did too.
