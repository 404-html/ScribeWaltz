1
00:00:05,130 --> 00:00:05,963
The question I get asked more than 
anything else lately is how can you 

2
00:00:07,621 --> 00:00:10,230
possibly say that revenge of the Sith 
was a good movie,

3
00:00:10,620 --> 00:00:12,390
but after that,
and I do have my reasons,

4
00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:15,990
the next most asked question is,
who do you trust in the media?

5
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:19,230
I'm finding this question harder and 
harder to answer these days,

6
00:00:19,231 --> 00:00:20,064
which is yet another indication of how 
screwed up our political and social 

7
00:00:23,761 --> 00:00:26,310
system is right now.
At the same time,

8
00:00:26,311 --> 00:00:27,144
it's hard to know just how screwy our 
world is or whether it's just the 

9
00:00:30,781 --> 00:00:31,614
loudest and craziest voices that 
consistently get amplified on social 

10
00:00:34,771 --> 00:00:35,604
media.
Maybe the American revolution actually 

11
00:00:37,411 --> 00:00:40,140
was a bit nuttier than the history books
would tell us,

12
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:41,153
but we'll never know because George 
Washington didn't have the chance to 

13
00:00:43,501 --> 00:00:44,334
live tweeted without trust.
We really don't have the basic 

14
00:00:48,091 --> 00:00:51,240
underpinnings for a free and pluralistic
society.

15
00:00:51,540 --> 00:00:52,373
We have to trust our elected officials,
will do the jobs they're sworn in to do 

16
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:59,520
and carry out the promises they said 
they would deliver upon.

17
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:00,713
We have to trust that our media will 
keep the political elite in check and 

18
00:01:04,171 --> 00:01:05,004
not just suck up to the powers that be 
and we have to trust that our 

19
00:01:08,461 --> 00:01:09,294
institutions are strong enough to 
withstand corrupt politicians and 

20
00:01:13,051 --> 00:01:17,850
totalitarian ideologies that would strip
us from the very freedoms our system was

21
00:01:17,851 --> 00:01:19,770
built upon.
Of course,

22
00:01:19,771 --> 00:01:20,604
trust without doing the necessary work 
to make sure it's based in logic and 

23
00:01:25,021 --> 00:01:25,854
reason is really just faith.
Having faith that our politicians will 

24
00:01:30,061 --> 00:01:30,894
do the right thing or that our media 
will hold the politicians to account or 

25
00:01:34,591 --> 00:01:35,424
that our system will just function as it
should is basically a recipe for 

26
00:01:39,121 --> 00:01:41,520
disaster.
Slowly but surely,

27
00:01:41,521 --> 00:01:42,354
our freedoms will be chipped away at 
because faith isn't what guarantees our 

28
00:01:45,721 --> 00:01:49,890
freedoms in the first place.
It's the constitution that does so.

29
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:51,113
Trust is built over time by repeated 
evidence that you can actually believe 

30
00:01:54,931 --> 00:01:57,780
that when someone says something,
it's what they mean.

31
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:00,690
You don't believe it's simply because 
they say it.

32
00:02:00,691 --> 00:02:01,524
You believe it because of a track record
of a person consistently following 

33
00:02:05,071 --> 00:02:08,250
through on their word.
This is the opposite of faith,

34
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:12,000
which is built on the idea of believing 
in something without evidence.

35
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:13,193
We usually talk about these existential 
issues in the context of God and 

36
00:02:16,291 --> 00:02:17,124
religion,
but I think it would serve us all well 

37
00:02:18,930 --> 00:02:23,790
to ask some important questions about 
these issues right here and right now.

38
00:02:24,570 --> 00:02:26,550
So now let me kick the question back to 
you.

39
00:02:26,670 --> 00:02:27,503
Who Do you trust in the media?
I'm guessing it's a pretty short list 

40
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:33,180
though.
If you've got some good names,

41
00:02:33,181 --> 00:02:34,014
I'd love to hear them in the comment 
section right down below and let's go a 

42
00:02:36,601 --> 00:02:39,360
step further with that.
Who Do you trust in politics?

43
00:02:39,690 --> 00:02:42,120
If you're the biggest trump supporter 
out there,

44
00:02:42,121 --> 00:02:42,954
do you truly trust everything that he 
says or do you accept his untruths 

45
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:49,860
because you believe in his wider agenda.

46
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:51,113
Accepting the certain amount of untruth 
may be the only legitimate way to view 

47
00:02:54,361 --> 00:02:58,560
politics and politicians,
but when you add a distrust of the media

48
00:02:58,590 --> 00:03:03,590
to a of politicians and then toss in a 
heavy dose of social media craziness,

49
00:03:03,970 --> 00:03:04,803
we ended up with this confused 
conversation in which we can't even 

50
00:03:07,871 --> 00:03:08,704
agree on basic facts.
This spot where nothing is really true 

51
00:03:12,910 --> 00:03:13,743
and what we feel overrides what's 
provable is fertile ground for those on 

52
00:03:17,831 --> 00:03:20,320
the extremes to take root.
So who do I trust?

53
00:03:20,321 --> 00:03:21,154
Well,
there's a wide range of people from Sam 

54
00:03:22,930 --> 00:03:24,730
Harris to Ben Shapiro,
to Larry Elder,

55
00:03:24,731 --> 00:03:25,564
to Eric Weinstein.
Trusting these people doesn't mean that 

56
00:03:28,361 --> 00:03:31,630
they're infallible or that I agree with 
everything that they say,

57
00:03:31,780 --> 00:03:32,613
but it does mean that I see they have a 
commitment to the truth and they've 

58
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:38,110
consistently done their best to put it 
out there.

59
00:03:38,380 --> 00:03:41,260
They don't have all the answers and I 
certainly don't either,

60
00:03:41,290 --> 00:03:45,850
but I think we're doing our best to find
some truth in the sea of craziness.

61
00:03:46,330 --> 00:03:47,163
For those of us who genuinely want to 
figure out how to combat the forces who 

62
00:03:50,411 --> 00:03:54,610
want to burn down the system or give 
into authoritarian tyranny.

63
00:03:54,820 --> 00:03:57,550
Our work is cut out for us.
As for me,

64
00:03:57,551 --> 00:03:58,384
I trust that it'll work out because I 
see more and more of you speaking out 

65
00:04:01,721 --> 00:04:02,554
every day.
You might just say that a little faith 

66
00:04:04,481 --> 00:04:06,160
in yourself goes a long way.

67
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:12,333
Joining me this week is a former 
candidate for president of the United 

68
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:17,380
States from the Libertarian Party and a 
man who,

69
00:04:17,381 --> 00:04:18,214
according to his twitter bio is pro 
liberty pro life and Pro Constitution 

70
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:24,580
Austin Petersen.
Welcome to the Rubin report.

71
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:25,473
Hey,
thanks for having me.

72
00:04:25,540 --> 00:04:27,970
We've been trying to do this for quite 
some time.

73
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:30,550
Our twitter.
It's going to go bonkers.

74
00:04:30,580 --> 00:04:33,740
My people love your pupil.
I don't know if you're like me yet,

75
00:04:33,820 --> 00:04:35,320
but I guess the kind of remains to be 
seen.

76
00:04:35,530 --> 00:04:37,330
I think they were there.
I don't know if you've noticed,

77
00:04:37,331 --> 00:04:39,220
but there seems to be a classical 
liberal,

78
00:04:39,221 --> 00:04:42,940
libertarian little bonding thing 
happening in America right now.

79
00:04:42,941 --> 00:04:43,774
People said that if I get you to say 
you're a smaller libertarian than that 

80
00:04:46,630 --> 00:04:48,370
they're going to donate five bucks.
My Super Pac.

81
00:04:48,380 --> 00:04:48,750
So it's.
Oh,

82
00:04:48,750 --> 00:04:50,830
is that right?
So are you a libertarian?

83
00:04:51,090 --> 00:04:53,560
We can where you can turn some of this 
on me at some point,

84
00:04:53,561 --> 00:04:54,710
but not right now yet.

85
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:55,900
Not yet.
Not just yet.

86
00:04:56,050 --> 00:04:56,591
So,
uh,

87
00:04:56,591 --> 00:04:57,424
so it's funny.
I shooting three shows today and I just 

88
00:04:59,741 --> 00:05:02,200
walked outside with my dog just to get 
some fresh air.

89
00:05:02,290 --> 00:05:03,850
I just found you wandering in the 
street,

90
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:05,250
you didn't even take a car here.
You're,

91
00:05:05,251 --> 00:05:06,760
you're truly a man of the people.
Yeah.

92
00:05:06,761 --> 00:05:07,391
Well,
you know,

93
00:05:07,391 --> 00:05:08,740
from Missouri,
I grew up on a farm.

94
00:05:08,770 --> 00:05:09,820
Pretty common,
you know,

95
00:05:09,821 --> 00:05:12,130
and uh,
I think that um,

96
00:05:12,420 --> 00:05:14,530
you know,
California is beautiful and uh,

97
00:05:14,531 --> 00:05:16,780
you know,
we're trying to like be environmentalist

98
00:05:16,781 --> 00:05:17,614
riding bicycles.
So I just want to walk and found your 

99
00:05:19,811 --> 00:05:20,621
studio.
Yeah.

100
00:05:20,621 --> 00:05:21,670
All right,
so here we are.

101
00:05:21,671 --> 00:05:25,360
There's a lot I want to get to with you,
but let's just start with the basics.

102
00:05:25,390 --> 00:05:26,800
People know,
I like definitions.

103
00:05:27,220 --> 00:05:28,053
You ran as a libertarian,
what is a libertarian to you will 

104
00:05:31,670 --> 00:05:32,503
essentially libertarian.
It allows you to choose your own values 

105
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:36,673
as long as you don't try and use the 
government to force those values on 

106
00:05:39,161 --> 00:05:39,994
somebody else.

107
00:05:40,110 --> 00:05:43,570
That's why we get a lot of infighting in
the Libertarian party because we have so

108
00:05:43,571 --> 00:05:46,300
many people from so many different 
backgrounds with different values.

109
00:05:46,630 --> 00:05:47,463
But the one value we all share is that 
we believe that government should be 

110
00:05:49,901 --> 00:05:53,750
limited so that individuals can choose 
what they want to do and,

111
00:05:53,751 --> 00:05:55,320
and choose their values.
And,

112
00:05:55,321 --> 00:05:57,470
and explore the wide range of options,
you know,

113
00:05:57,650 --> 00:05:59,550
sometimes those options are dangerous,
you know,

114
00:05:59,630 --> 00:06:00,463
some people choose to smoke,
but they should have the right to do 

115
00:06:02,481 --> 00:06:05,930
that as long as they don't try and 
impose a cost on others.

116
00:06:05,931 --> 00:06:06,600
Right.
And,

117
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:07,433
and so as soon as you start talking 
about what sort of cost people are 

118
00:06:10,611 --> 00:06:11,444
imposing on others,
that's when government starts to come 

119
00:06:13,521 --> 00:06:14,450
into the equation,
you know,

120
00:06:14,451 --> 00:06:16,820
at the most hardcore end of 
libertarianism,

121
00:06:17,220 --> 00:06:21,530
which some say a is the true 
libertarianism is it's anarchy.

122
00:06:21,531 --> 00:06:25,490
And our coo capitalism,
I think I fall right before that.

123
00:06:25,850 --> 00:06:28,660
I train right there and I,
I call myself a min,

124
00:06:28,670 --> 00:06:29,503
darkest.
Essentially the government should be 

125
00:06:30,741 --> 00:06:34,550
relegated very basic rules.
They should protect life,

126
00:06:34,551 --> 00:06:36,140
liberty,
and the pursuit of happiness.

127
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:37,233
You know,
that may include things like fire 

128
00:06:38,271 --> 00:06:39,021
courts,
police,

129
00:06:39,021 --> 00:06:41,180
military,
otherwise the,

130
00:06:41,181 --> 00:06:43,250
everything else should be solved by the 
market.

131
00:06:43,420 --> 00:06:44,253
Yeah.
So I had a Brian Caplan from George 

132
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:49,190
Mason University who's in an narco 
capital verlander co,

133
00:06:49,210 --> 00:06:51,460
capital Arco for some reason.
Yeah.

134
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:55,340
Brilliant guy and I thoroughly.
We did about an hour and a half.

135
00:06:55,341 --> 00:06:57,710
I enjoyed every minute of it.
There were moments where I thought,

136
00:06:57,740 --> 00:06:58,573
all right,
this is a bit much know some private 

137
00:06:59,691 --> 00:07:02,480
court stuff and some of the passivism 
stuff and open borders,

138
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:07,640
but is that the inherent problem with 
the Libertarian Party?

139
00:07:07,670 --> 00:07:08,503
Not The philosophy,
but the party that this thing is really 

140
00:07:11,301 --> 00:07:15,770
wide and when you say I'm a libertarian,
people see some of these guys or some of

141
00:07:15,771 --> 00:07:16,200
the,
you know,

142
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:17,033
at the convention,
that guy running around without a shirt 

143
00:07:18,531 --> 00:07:20,330
and some of them were crazy pieces.

144
00:07:20,330 --> 00:07:23,800
That was the worst thing that happened 
to get to that in a second,

145
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:27,080
but that it's bad because it's based on 
the individual.

146
00:07:27,110 --> 00:07:27,943
It's hard to get a whole bunch of 
individually focused people to agree on 

147
00:07:31,941 --> 00:07:35,360
something because essentially you're 
talking about taking collective action,

148
00:07:35,361 --> 00:07:35,711
right?
Yeah.

149
00:07:35,711 --> 00:07:37,810
This is kind of anathema to the 
libertarian cause,

150
00:07:38,270 --> 00:07:40,790
but I mean the Libertarian party is made
up of sincere individuals.

151
00:07:40,791 --> 00:07:42,440
These people really want limited 
government.

152
00:07:42,441 --> 00:07:45,830
A lot of these people are victims of the
state of people that have been harmed,

153
00:07:46,130 --> 00:07:46,963
whether they've been persecuted in their
communities for doing things like 

154
00:07:48,951 --> 00:07:51,830
homeschooling or maybe they want to 
drink raw milk,

155
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:52,673
right?
Maybe they want to have the ability to 

156
00:07:53,421 --> 00:07:54,141
sell that,
right?

157
00:07:54,141 --> 00:07:56,400
Amish farmers and things like that.
So it's,

158
00:07:56,420 --> 00:07:59,420
it's kind of easy to poke fun at the 
people like the naked guy,

159
00:07:59,421 --> 00:08:00,254
but,
but,

160
00:08:00,410 --> 00:08:03,260
but the thing is,
is that the news often doesn't go in and

161
00:08:03,261 --> 00:08:07,330
cover the tales of the single mothers 
who are being harmed because their,

162
00:08:07,340 --> 00:08:10,490
their tax rates are so high that it's 
hard for them to feed their kids.

163
00:08:10,790 --> 00:08:11,623
Right?
That doesn't make as compelling a new 

164
00:08:12,361 --> 00:08:14,070
story as the guy who,
you know,

165
00:08:14,071 --> 00:08:15,620
dances around.
So,

166
00:08:15,650 --> 00:08:17,510
so there,
the problem is,

167
00:08:17,511 --> 00:08:20,510
is that we're missing the forest for the
trees in some sense.

168
00:08:20,780 --> 00:08:21,613
And there are a lot of sincere dedicated
activists and Libertarian party who 

169
00:08:23,961 --> 00:08:24,794
really just want to.
They're not just fighting for their own 

170
00:08:26,571 --> 00:08:27,404
freedom and many of them,
many of them are sincere patriots who 

171
00:08:29,781 --> 00:08:30,614
are fighting for the freedom of their 
fellow countrymen and they just see the 

172
00:08:32,421 --> 00:08:36,470
two parties as being one in the same in 
some sense that they really.

173
00:08:36,471 --> 00:08:38,510
That their solutions are just more 
government.

174
00:08:38,750 --> 00:08:39,600
So that's what,
that's,

175
00:08:39,610 --> 00:08:42,740
that's the kind of the untold story of 
the heroes of the Libertarian party,

176
00:08:42,741 --> 00:08:44,120
which we don't see very often.
Right.

177
00:08:44,121 --> 00:08:44,954
Okay.
So I want to spend most of our time 

178
00:08:45,741 --> 00:08:48,470
talking about looking forward,
but we do have to look back a little bit

179
00:08:48,471 --> 00:08:49,304
here.
Right?

180
00:08:49,940 --> 00:08:50,773
I mean,
to me 2016 was a massive disaster for 

181
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:56,550
you guys because

182
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:58,200
I,
I've said this a billion times.

183
00:08:58,260 --> 00:09:00,420
First off I voted for Gary.
Okay.

184
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:01,373
I've had Gary Johnson on the show.
The candidacy ultimately was just 

185
00:09:05,191 --> 00:09:06,024
terrible and I think if there was ever a
year where the libertarians or any 

186
00:09:09,501 --> 00:09:10,410
third,
maybe the Greens,

187
00:09:10,411 --> 00:09:12,510
whoever,
although obviously I agree more with you

188
00:09:12,511 --> 00:09:13,510
guys.
Uh,

189
00:09:13,550 --> 00:09:16,380
but if there was ever a year where there
was going to be a mark made,

190
00:09:16,470 --> 00:09:17,910
not,
not the presidency,

191
00:09:17,911 --> 00:09:19,650
but a mark to be made.
This was it.

192
00:09:19,651 --> 00:09:22,380
There was so much discussed with trump 
and Clinton.

193
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:23,310
What happened?

194
00:09:24,310 --> 00:09:25,780
I'll tell you this topic,
I mean,

195
00:09:25,810 --> 00:09:28,250
this turns me into Salt Bay,
like,

196
00:09:29,890 --> 00:09:30,723
but um,
don't you usually walk around with a 

197
00:09:31,841 --> 00:09:33,340
musket,
couldn't make the,

198
00:09:33,341 --> 00:09:34,750
uh,
the far the flintlock right?

199
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:35,800
Yeah.
The stuff,

200
00:09:35,830 --> 00:09:37,090
boy,
you're going to get my hackles up.

201
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:37,953
Alright.
So it's very difficult to be in this 

202
00:09:40,381 --> 00:09:43,180
situation.
We're in the position of having tried to

203
00:09:43,181 --> 00:09:45,070
stop that right now having kind of seen 
it.

204
00:09:45,220 --> 00:09:46,053
There's nothing more frustrating and I 
think a lot of libertarian see this in 

205
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:49,833
so many other ways on society as a whole
where we see things kind of rushing 

206
00:09:52,931 --> 00:09:54,790
toward a cliff and you're screaming 
stop.

207
00:09:54,820 --> 00:09:55,653
And people,
if you're going to tell people the 

208
00:09:57,941 --> 00:09:58,774
truth,
you better make them laugh or else 

209
00:09:59,631 --> 00:10:02,740
they'll kill you.
A and a that's happening in society.

210
00:10:02,741 --> 00:10:03,574
But with the Libertarian party,
there were so many times when the 

211
00:10:05,801 --> 00:10:06,634
account at the incompetence was being 
displayed pre-primary and people either 

212
00:10:10,421 --> 00:10:12,430
weren't paying attention or they were 
applauding it.

213
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:13,553
Uh,
I mean there's videos of some of the 

214
00:10:15,191 --> 00:10:17,650
gaps and stumbles and one on before the 
convention.

215
00:10:17,950 --> 00:10:18,783
And I don't think there's any excuse.
I mean the people who take 

216
00:10:20,831 --> 00:10:21,664
responsibility for what it was need to 
take responsibility because they had 

217
00:10:24,431 --> 00:10:28,120
every opportunity to try and stop it and
they sort of cheered it on.

218
00:10:28,121 --> 00:10:28,954
But you know,
the Libertarian party has a lot of the 

219
00:10:29,981 --> 00:10:34,981
same problems that the major two party 
has with cults of personality and things

220
00:10:35,471 --> 00:10:38,620
like that and with none of the upsides 
of actually winning elections.

221
00:10:39,510 --> 00:10:43,000
So that's the problems of,
of fighting a in a third party.

222
00:10:43,001 --> 00:10:43,834
But

223
00:10:43,950 --> 00:10:44,783
is there a bigger issue here,
which is that for the specific stumbles 

224
00:10:48,391 --> 00:10:50,700
that Gary made once he got the 
nomination,

225
00:10:50,850 --> 00:10:51,683
and again I liked him as a person,
I think he's a decent guy and I hope 

226
00:10:54,481 --> 00:10:57,060
you'll come back here and I'd be happy 
to discuss all this stuff with him.

227
00:10:57,220 --> 00:10:58,650
Um,
but he's,

228
00:10:58,651 --> 00:10:59,484
that the bigger issue,
the only time anyone ever talked about 

229
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:02,633
the libertarians was when he either made
a gaff or when the naked guy ran round 

230
00:11:07,290 --> 00:11:09,120
beyond that,
there was virtually no coverage.

231
00:11:09,121 --> 00:11:12,300
So it was almost as if you had to do 
outlandish things.

232
00:11:12,301 --> 00:11:13,134
So I watched the libertarian debates and
I thought they needed to say more crazy 

233
00:11:17,851 --> 00:11:20,760
things if anyone was going to pay 
attention as even though I don't believe

234
00:11:20,761 --> 00:11:21,930
that generally related to to

235
00:11:21,950 --> 00:11:24,290
politics,
it's not about what you say,

236
00:11:24,291 --> 00:11:26,240
it's about how you say it very 
frequently.

237
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:27,313
Right.
And so sometimes it was just Gary's 

238
00:11:28,580 --> 00:11:29,413
delivery that came off as awkward.
It wasn't necessarily what he was 

239
00:11:31,191 --> 00:11:32,780
saying,
but the way that he was saying it,

240
00:11:32,781 --> 00:11:35,040
which I think puts people off.
Uh,

241
00:11:35,041 --> 00:11:35,874
and the thing about Donald trump that I 
think was so attractive was that he was 

242
00:11:38,301 --> 00:11:40,700
giving the last year was a crazy bastard
year.

243
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:41,510
Right?
And,

244
00:11:41,510 --> 00:11:43,040
and libertarians,
that's crazy bastards.

245
00:11:43,041 --> 00:11:44,350
That could have been our year.
Yeah.

246
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:45,200
Uh,
and you know,

247
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:46,033
with the rise of the alt right,
which is really what propelled in many 

248
00:11:48,561 --> 00:11:50,960
ways helped propel donald to the 
presidency.

249
00:11:51,260 --> 00:11:52,670
A lot of those people,
you know,

250
00:11:52,730 --> 00:11:55,880
were sincere conservatives who were 
looking for a,

251
00:11:56,190 --> 00:11:57,670
a third option,
a,

252
00:11:57,690 --> 00:12:00,130
they wanted somebody who could take down
Hillary.

253
00:12:00,370 --> 00:12:01,203
And I think that the real strategy 
problem was simply that it looked as if 

254
00:12:04,750 --> 00:12:08,080
gary and bill were sort of cozying up to
Hillary,

255
00:12:08,260 --> 00:12:11,770
which is what nobody in the United 
States wanted because they rejected her.

256
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:13,900
So it wasn't so much what Gary was 
saying,

257
00:12:13,901 --> 00:12:14,734
it was,
it was relied a little bit more on 

258
00:12:15,911 --> 00:12:17,050
tactics.
I mean,

259
00:12:17,051 --> 00:12:18,700
yeah,
the delivery was not that good,

260
00:12:18,730 --> 00:12:20,800
but.
And the gas were horrible,

261
00:12:21,100 --> 00:12:21,933
but it,
it really just comes down to not being 

262
00:12:23,591 --> 00:12:26,230
able to read the political winds of the,
of the time.

263
00:12:26,231 --> 00:12:28,230
And that's really where we suffered.
Yeah.

264
00:12:28,270 --> 00:12:29,103
Without getting too thick in the weeds 
on just the machinations behind the 

265
00:12:31,811 --> 00:12:32,644
scene of the party,
because I don't think people really 

266
00:12:34,271 --> 00:12:36,410
understand like what happens by the 
party.

267
00:12:36,411 --> 00:12:38,590
So we know the Democrats have this 
massive machine.

268
00:12:38,830 --> 00:12:42,310
We know it's deeply corrupt and that was
a lot of that has been exposed.

269
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:44,770
The Republicans also have a pretty 
powerful machine.

270
00:12:45,060 --> 00:12:47,710
I don't think it's quite as corrupt,
but who knows what is,

271
00:12:47,740 --> 00:12:49,990
what is the underpinnings of the 
libertarian machine,

272
00:12:49,991 --> 00:12:51,700
like what's going on behind the scenes?

273
00:12:51,730 --> 00:12:53,130
Who's in charge?
What?

274
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:54,430
Nobody.
Anarchy,

275
00:12:54,450 --> 00:12:55,660
right.
I mean,

276
00:12:55,690 --> 00:12:57,120
they have the Libertarian National 
Committee,

277
00:12:57,140 --> 00:12:59,200
their job is to run candidates for 
office.

278
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:00,040
Um,
the.

279
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:00,873
I think the good thing about the 
Libertarian party is that anybody can 

280
00:13:04,391 --> 00:13:05,350
participate,
right?

281
00:13:05,490 --> 00:13:06,323
They sound like a Democrat,
so they have super delegates and things 

282
00:13:08,021 --> 00:13:08,854
like that.
I mean anybody can become a delegate if 

283
00:13:10,421 --> 00:13:12,640
you joined the Libertarian Party and go 
to your state convention.

284
00:13:12,850 --> 00:13:13,683
So the way that the Libertarian party 
works is it's powered by the people 

285
00:13:16,580 --> 00:13:17,440
there,
there isn't,

286
00:13:17,490 --> 00:13:19,210
you know,
some shadowy Koch money,

287
00:13:19,211 --> 00:13:20,980
you know,
the Koch brothers left years ago.

288
00:13:21,070 --> 00:13:21,903
So it's really just powered by the 
activist and the people who want to try 

289
00:13:24,401 --> 00:13:26,650
and see these ideas be put into public 
policy.

290
00:13:26,860 --> 00:13:29,190
Now there are some people who actually,
they,

291
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:30,233
they caucus with the party,
but they don't want the party to 

292
00:13:31,871 --> 00:13:34,600
actually win elections for,
for multitudes of reasons.

293
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:35,433
One being perhaps that they think that 
there'll be a system wide collapsed and 

294
00:13:38,171 --> 00:13:39,580
libertarians will get blamed for it if 
some,

295
00:13:39,590 --> 00:13:40,423
if there was a libertarian president and
another one is that they think that the 

296
00:13:42,671 --> 00:13:43,504
parties should be educational.
So you've got all these different 

297
00:13:45,161 --> 00:13:47,210
factions in the party,
uh,

298
00:13:47,220 --> 00:13:48,053
and,
and some of them are sincere and 

299
00:13:48,850 --> 00:13:51,100
committed activists who really want to 
bring about change,

300
00:13:51,340 --> 00:13:52,870
but the,
but when it comes to the machinations,

301
00:13:52,900 --> 00:13:55,210
it's what you see for the most part is 
what you get.

302
00:13:55,211 --> 00:13:56,044
I mean,
there are some backroom dealings and 

303
00:13:56,861 --> 00:13:59,980
things that go on and so a lot of 
pressure and hassling that goes onto the

304
00:13:59,981 --> 00:14:00,814
convention.
People Endorse Bill Weld will give you 

305
00:14:02,771 --> 00:14:03,604
the world.
It's like that story in the Bible where 

306
00:14:05,351 --> 00:14:06,184
like they take juices and Satan is like,
if you will bow before me and I know 

307
00:14:09,330 --> 00:14:10,750
bill well,
but,

308
00:14:10,751 --> 00:14:11,830
um,
but you know,

309
00:14:11,831 --> 00:14:12,610
there's,
there's,

310
00:14:12,610 --> 00:14:13,660
that kind of stuff happens.

311
00:14:13,660 --> 00:14:16,570
But for the most part it's what you see 
is what you get.

312
00:14:17,010 --> 00:14:17,843
Was there a moment a after Gary got the 
nomination that you would have 

313
00:14:21,551 --> 00:14:25,420
considered being his vp or did they 
announce once he got the nomination,

314
00:14:25,421 --> 00:14:27,520
did they say they were a team 
immediately?

315
00:14:27,970 --> 00:14:30,040
Of course.
So he was running to be the VP.

316
00:14:30,070 --> 00:14:31,920
And um,
the thing was this,

317
00:14:31,950 --> 00:14:32,783
you know,
my mistakes that I made at the 

318
00:14:33,671 --> 00:14:36,110
convention was that I actually took the 
principal,

319
00:14:36,111 --> 00:14:40,030
moves over the pragmatic moves and I'll 
just explain this very briefly.

320
00:14:40,031 --> 00:14:42,820
So there was a brief period of time when
some people said,

321
00:14:42,821 --> 00:14:46,030
Okay Austin,
if you want just go run for the VP slot.

322
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:47,193
But because I was trying to think for 
what the good of the party and for the 

323
00:14:50,291 --> 00:14:51,980
good of the ticket,
I thought to myself,

324
00:14:52,010 --> 00:14:52,843
okay,
well Gary hates me and I wouldn't want 

325
00:14:56,661 --> 00:14:59,750
to be hamstrung by a VP that I can't 
stand.

326
00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:01,780
And he obviously wanted bill,
you know,

327
00:15:01,790 --> 00:15:03,920
the delegates thought that he was 
better.

328
00:15:03,921 --> 00:15:05,330
So I was trying to,
I,

329
00:15:05,331 --> 00:15:07,730
I gave into the will of the majority and
I thought,

330
00:15:07,731 --> 00:15:09,860
no,
I'm not going to do this because I think

331
00:15:09,861 --> 00:15:11,960
it's going to cripple the ticket.
Well then later,

332
00:15:12,010 --> 00:15:12,843
I stupidly,
I didn't realize that Gary had 

333
00:15:14,661 --> 00:15:16,520
threatened that if he didn't get bill 
weld,

334
00:15:16,521 --> 00:15:17,354
he would quit.
So if I had been the VP then I would 

335
00:15:20,361 --> 00:15:24,120
have been a candidate if gary had quit.
So maybe I should have just stuck it.

336
00:15:24,140 --> 00:15:24,973
Dual.
I suspect he wouldn't have chose you 

337
00:15:25,941 --> 00:15:26,760
though.
No,

338
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:27,593
but they choose.
That's how the Libertarian party is 

339
00:15:29,691 --> 00:15:30,524
different from the major two parties.
The delegates choose the vice 

340
00:15:32,541 --> 00:15:35,270
presidential candidate.
So if I really wanted to be a bug chunk,

341
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:38,090
I could've,
I could've taken my gun out of the trash

342
00:15:38,210 --> 00:15:39,043
and mounted a campaign to try and be the
VP pick with the hopes that Gary would 

343
00:15:42,501 --> 00:15:42,740
quit.

344
00:15:42,740 --> 00:15:45,380
But that's just being again,
a jerk.

345
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:49,280
I already have been labeled a jerk so 
I'm trying to get away from them.

346
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:53,110
So my last question to you at the end of
this is going to be about 20,

347
00:15:53,130 --> 00:15:53,720
20,
but,

348
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:57,410
but as a lead into that then,
so you learned that lesson there.

349
00:15:57,411 --> 00:15:58,244
So do you think you would do things 
differently next time before you even 

350
00:16:00,381 --> 00:16:01,880
tell me if 20,
20 is an option?

351
00:16:01,881 --> 00:16:02,714
Yes,
I would definitely do things 

352
00:16:03,531 --> 00:16:04,760
differently.
And uh,

353
00:16:04,790 --> 00:16:05,623
you know,
there are certain things that you 

354
00:16:06,531 --> 00:16:07,850
learned from the process,
you know,

355
00:16:07,851 --> 00:16:09,490
hindsight is 20 slash 20.
Uh,

356
00:16:09,860 --> 00:16:10,460
but,
uh,

357
00:16:10,460 --> 00:16:11,293
I think that tactically I made some 
mistakes but print from a principal 

358
00:16:14,451 --> 00:16:16,310
perspective,
I did everything right,

359
00:16:16,370 --> 00:16:18,620
raised money,
the grassroots way online,

360
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:21,320
you know,
just doing live streams and going around

361
00:16:21,321 --> 00:16:23,660
the country.
I think we raised $120,000,

362
00:16:23,860 --> 00:16:24,581
so,
so in,

363
00:16:24,581 --> 00:16:25,414
in a lot of ways,
my campaign pioneered many of the 

364
00:16:27,351 --> 00:16:29,990
campaigns in the future for people who 
have no power,

365
00:16:29,991 --> 00:16:30,230
right?

366
00:16:30,230 --> 00:16:34,100
People who are grassroots who can come 
out of nowhere and I think I showed that

367
00:16:34,101 --> 00:16:35,900
people who are sincere committed 
activists can,

368
00:16:35,930 --> 00:16:38,150
can do that.
So there are some things that I would do

369
00:16:38,151 --> 00:16:38,984
differently,
but most of it's just sort of 

370
00:16:39,710 --> 00:16:40,543
parliamentary procedure things.
How much for you as an outsider running 

371
00:16:44,571 --> 00:16:46,970
on an outsider,
a ticket,

372
00:16:47,420 --> 00:16:48,253
uh,
was about raising money because that to 

373
00:16:49,701 --> 00:16:51,500
me is the root of all the problems right
now.

374
00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:52,430
Well,
you know what,

375
00:16:52,431 --> 00:16:53,264
the funny thing was was that I found 
about raising money is that when things 

376
00:16:55,281 --> 00:16:57,380
are good and you're happy and you're 
doing well,

377
00:16:57,410 --> 00:16:58,640
you know,
people will send you money.

378
00:16:58,850 --> 00:17:01,280
But there's nothing that raises money 
like controversy.

379
00:17:01,550 --> 00:17:02,383
And one thing that happened to me,
and it's so ironic because I was just 

380
00:17:04,971 --> 00:17:06,590
their keynote speaker this year,
now,

381
00:17:07,100 --> 00:17:07,933
the Colorado Libertarian Party 
disinvited me from their debate and I 

382
00:17:12,621 --> 00:17:15,120
was in Illinois at the time and I'm 
there with my,

383
00:17:15,180 --> 00:17:15,920
my staff.

384
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:16,641
And they said,
okay,

385
00:17:16,641 --> 00:17:17,474
well you're not invited because I 
disagree with some of the radical 

386
00:17:20,331 --> 00:17:22,610
anarchists on one of their base 
philosophical principles.

387
00:17:22,611 --> 00:17:23,011
So they're like,
oh,

388
00:17:23,011 --> 00:17:24,230
you're not libertarian,
you're not invited.

389
00:17:24,570 --> 00:17:26,290
What principle is,
it's called the,

390
00:17:26,291 --> 00:17:27,890
the nap,
the nap,

391
00:17:27,891 --> 00:17:29,720
the nonaggression principle.
Uh,

392
00:17:29,830 --> 00:17:30,663
which many libertarians believe that is 
the centerpiece of libertarian 

393
00:17:33,891 --> 00:17:36,920
philosophy,
which I in no uncertain terms completely

394
00:17:36,921 --> 00:17:40,670
reject simply because in my mind,
I believe it leads one to a form,

395
00:17:40,700 --> 00:17:42,650
a strict form of pacifism,
which,

396
00:17:42,651 --> 00:17:45,280
which doesn't account for self defense,
which they,

397
00:17:45,281 --> 00:17:46,770
they dispute,
uh,

398
00:17:46,771 --> 00:17:47,604
but aggression being a sort of a,
a term that can be broadly used in many 

399
00:17:51,151 --> 00:17:51,984
ways.
Like what do you different define as 

400
00:17:52,801 --> 00:17:54,480
aggression?
It leads one to consider.

401
00:17:54,481 --> 00:17:56,370
Maybe we will need a court system to 
Suss it out,

402
00:17:56,371 --> 00:18:00,510
which would imply a government which 
would end the argument for anarchy,

403
00:18:00,850 --> 00:18:02,700
right?
They have gotten,

404
00:18:02,701 --> 00:18:04,800
they disagree and they're going to be 
very mad at me for saying that,

405
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:06,113
but so you're taking in that specific 
and what you would argue is just a more 

406
00:18:08,581 --> 00:18:11,150
realistic approach or a more functional 
approach.

407
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:12,900
Not really.
It's not a matter of realism.

408
00:18:12,901 --> 00:18:14,040
Essentially.
It's a matter of,

409
00:18:14,180 --> 00:18:18,390
of real true principle simply because 
many people have argued,

410
00:18:18,391 --> 00:18:19,770
and boy,
this is going to make people mad,

411
00:18:19,771 --> 00:18:20,210
but,
uh,

412
00:18:20,210 --> 00:18:21,043
in the end,
the concept of we're putting this on 

413
00:18:23,101 --> 00:18:23,934
youtube and youtube comments or anything
but lovely liberal friends are gonna 

414
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:30,510
like it kind of a heretic in libertarian
circles for this,

415
00:18:30,990 --> 00:18:31,823
but simply many libertarians have argued
and many have told me directly to my 

416
00:18:34,561 --> 00:18:35,394
face that the evil of government is,
is so horrible that it's better that we 

417
00:18:40,350 --> 00:18:44,430
have a society where it may be immoral 
to allow a child to starve to death,

418
00:18:44,700 --> 00:18:48,930
but it's not illegal simply because it's
all about the initiation of force.

419
00:18:49,350 --> 00:18:50,490
Right?
And I like to play the,

420
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:51,210
the,
um,

421
00:18:51,210 --> 00:18:52,650
the puzzle game.
You know,

422
00:18:52,651 --> 00:18:54,690
if you walk past a homeless person on 
the street,

423
00:18:54,691 --> 00:18:57,510
they're starving to death and you don't 
feed them.

424
00:18:57,510 --> 00:18:59,280
Have you committed a crime?
No.

425
00:18:59,370 --> 00:19:01,050
Have you initiated force?
No.

426
00:19:01,310 --> 00:19:02,143
If you have a child and it's your child 
and by neglect you allow that child to 

427
00:19:06,091 --> 00:19:07,830
starve to death.
Have you committed a crime?

428
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:08,753
Yes.
Have you initiated force know so that 

429
00:19:11,540 --> 00:19:14,130
that's really where it comes down to it.
The rights of children is,

430
00:19:14,131 --> 00:19:17,790
is sort of where we start talking about 
whether or not some third party may have

431
00:19:17,791 --> 00:19:18,624
a right to come in,
but that controversy was enough to make 

432
00:19:21,031 --> 00:19:21,864
the libertarian part of Colorado say no,
and it made my activist so angry that 

433
00:19:25,591 --> 00:19:26,424
they started pouring money my coffers 
saying Austin drive to Colorado right 

434
00:19:29,431 --> 00:19:30,264
now and we drove all night.
Thirteen hours straight to the 

435
00:19:31,771 --> 00:19:33,780
convention,
took second place.

436
00:19:33,781 --> 00:19:34,614
You know,
beat up on Gary a little bit and raise 

437
00:19:36,361 --> 00:19:37,194
money so that.
That's fascinating because this 

438
00:19:39,850 --> 00:19:42,810
infighting of all the parties I find 
incredible.

439
00:19:42,810 --> 00:19:46,860
Like just the inability for anyone to 
build a bridge these days,

440
00:19:46,861 --> 00:19:49,500
which is so much of what I'm.
I'm not a political insider,

441
00:19:49,620 --> 00:19:50,453
but what I'm trying to do around here is
build some bridges and show people you 

442
00:19:53,071 --> 00:19:53,904
can disagree on abortion and we'll talk 
about that in a little bit and a bunch 

443
00:19:56,341 --> 00:19:59,910
of different things and still find some 
basic principles to believe in.

444
00:20:00,060 --> 00:20:03,210
But let's just talk about the general 
role of government because that's really

445
00:20:03,211 --> 00:20:04,044
what this all comes down to.
So you touched on it just a little bit 

446
00:20:06,210 --> 00:20:07,043
up top.
Give me the basic things that you 

447
00:20:09,031 --> 00:20:12,090
believe government should exist for the 
specifics,

448
00:20:12,091 --> 00:20:12,924
not just,
not just the ideas of liberty and that 

449
00:20:14,191 --> 00:20:17,520
sort of thing.
So the libertarianism isn't really about

450
00:20:17,521 --> 00:20:19,200
government,
it's about self government.

451
00:20:19,290 --> 00:20:20,970
So that's the concept that,
that,

452
00:20:20,971 --> 00:20:22,950
uh,
you and if you have a,

453
00:20:22,951 --> 00:20:25,050
just,
if you have a moral just society,

454
00:20:25,350 --> 00:20:27,200
then people should be self-governed.

455
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:28,500
Uh,
and uh,

456
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:29,393
so it,
it's different from the sort of FDR 

457
00:20:31,111 --> 00:20:31,944
definition of freedom because FDR and 
the Social Democrats believe that 

458
00:20:36,390 --> 00:20:40,230
freedom means freedom from want.
So you're not free if you're hungry,

459
00:20:40,290 --> 00:20:41,580
that's their,
their definition.

460
00:20:41,790 --> 00:20:42,623
So the question really comes down to is,
is that we as Libertarians have a 

461
00:20:46,870 --> 00:20:50,980
different concept of freedom from most 
people because our concept of freedom is

462
00:20:51,010 --> 00:20:51,843
the most politically incorrect because 
it requires personal responsibility and 

463
00:20:55,390 --> 00:20:58,000
when you start telling talking to people
about personal responsibility,

464
00:20:58,060 --> 00:20:58,893
that's when I get angry because as the,
and even libertarians aren't perfect 

465
00:21:01,841 --> 00:21:03,490
when it comes down to this,
but when,

466
00:21:03,491 --> 00:21:05,530
when it comes to the actual role of 
government,

467
00:21:05,531 --> 00:21:10,210
it should be the absolute minimum that 
is required in order to sustain life,

468
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:11,950
liberty,
and the pursuit of happiness.

469
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:14,710
That's the declaration of independence.
That's not the law,

470
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:15,873
but the constitution being the law,
it has very specific enumerated powers 

471
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:23,050
as sometimes conservatives I think make 
a mistake where they'll say,

472
00:21:23,051 --> 00:21:24,550
well,
we believe in states rights,

473
00:21:24,940 --> 00:21:26,320
and the Libertarian says,
no,

474
00:21:26,321 --> 00:21:28,690
actually that's a misnomer.

475
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:30,880
Only people have rights.
You know,

476
00:21:30,881 --> 00:21:31,714
states have powers and the idea is that 
those powers should be strictly limited 

477
00:21:35,351 --> 00:21:38,380
and enumerated.
So we delegate some of our,

478
00:21:38,890 --> 00:21:39,723
some of our power to government,
but we don't delegate and have our 

479
00:21:41,891 --> 00:21:42,724
rights to government.
Our rights are intrinsic or rights are 

480
00:21:44,601 --> 00:21:45,434
natural.
They are self evident as to our 

481
00:21:47,201 --> 00:21:48,034
humanity,
and so libertarians simply believe that 

482
00:21:51,221 --> 00:21:52,054
the individual should be self govern and
governed to is to the greatest extent 

483
00:21:54,941 --> 00:21:57,640
possible until that self governance is a
problem,

484
00:21:57,641 --> 00:21:59,200
right?
If you do not police yourself,

485
00:21:59,710 --> 00:22:02,950
you will be policed.
So in or so as long as I'm,

486
00:22:02,990 --> 00:22:03,823
you know,
whatever action that you're taking 

487
00:22:04,511 --> 00:22:05,344
isn't,
it created some negative externality on 

488
00:22:06,941 --> 00:22:08,950
the community in that question,
you know,

489
00:22:08,951 --> 00:22:10,650
when it comes to the environment,
right?

490
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:11,513
What are the,
you may be polluting or something like 

491
00:22:12,341 --> 00:22:13,174
that.
These were problems with libertarians 

492
00:22:13,721 --> 00:22:14,554
face,
we believe in a strict definition of 

493
00:22:16,001 --> 00:22:16,960
property rights.

494
00:22:17,230 --> 00:22:20,140
So essentially what government should do
is it should,

495
00:22:20,590 --> 00:22:21,423
you know,
adjudicate disputes between property 

496
00:22:22,691 --> 00:22:27,691
rights holders and it should prosecute 
criminal cases of force and fraud really

497
00:22:28,661 --> 00:22:29,494
is what it should do.
And that's really the limited role of 

498
00:22:31,931 --> 00:22:32,764
government.
So you would take like sanitation away 

499
00:22:34,511 --> 00:22:37,570
from the government,
you would take the US Postal Service.

500
00:22:37,940 --> 00:22:38,773
All of those kinds of things were easy 
where we're keeping courts where we're 

501
00:22:42,910 --> 00:22:47,910
keeping a cops and then nuclear weapons 
in my opinion.

502
00:22:48,221 --> 00:22:48,760
But yeah,
but,

503
00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:50,950
but that's cops,
courts nukes.

504
00:22:50,970 --> 00:22:51,461
Yeah,
cops,

505
00:22:51,461 --> 00:22:52,430
courts have nukes.
Well,

506
00:22:52,610 --> 00:22:55,120
I think we just came up with your slogan
for a couple different way.

507
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:57,630
If I ever write a police.
Yeah.

508
00:22:58,120 --> 00:23:02,040
How is any of this different or do you 
consider yourself an objectivist?

509
00:23:02,060 --> 00:23:03,280
Actually,
I mean,

510
00:23:03,490 --> 00:23:04,323
I flirt with them now.
Can really get you in trouble because I 

511
00:23:05,741 --> 00:23:07,110
know you mentioned Iran.

512
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:07,953
People go nuts.
I like a lot of it and I've had many 

513
00:23:09,581 --> 00:23:10,320
people,
uh,

514
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:12,550
your own Brooke who is books right over 
there.

515
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,250
I think that she,
she rejects altruism.

516
00:23:15,251 --> 00:23:17,360
I get a joy out of doing something.
I know she,

517
00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:18,730
the argument is that,
well,

518
00:23:18,731 --> 00:23:20,750
if you get a joy out of doing it for 
other good people,

519
00:23:20,770 --> 00:23:22,810
then it's selfish,
but it's not entirely selfish.

520
00:23:22,811 --> 00:23:23,211
I mean,
I,

521
00:23:23,211 --> 00:23:24,460
I think that,
um,

522
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:26,260
you know,
that there is a,

523
00:23:26,620 --> 00:23:27,453
there is a desire for us to sacrifice 
ourselves in order to do it for the 

524
00:23:32,471 --> 00:23:33,304
greater good.
Some people think that the government 

525
00:23:34,931 --> 00:23:38,140
should require that sacrifice on.
It's like mandatory service.

526
00:23:38,470 --> 00:23:41,230
But as a libertarian,
I believe in voluntary service,

527
00:23:41,231 --> 00:23:44,050
a voluntary military.
And if I were to,

528
00:23:44,051 --> 00:23:44,884
if I had served in the military,
I would be doing it out of a sense of 

529
00:23:47,151 --> 00:23:48,350
patriotism,
which would be,

530
00:23:48,590 --> 00:23:50,540
in some sense,
a sense of selflessness.

531
00:23:50,650 --> 00:23:52,340
I think many people have been drafted,
right?

532
00:23:52,341 --> 00:23:53,174
But a lot of people who fought in world 
war against the Nazis were doing it 

533
00:23:55,610 --> 00:23:56,443
because they were fighting for their 
family and they were fighting out of a 

534
00:23:58,581 --> 00:24:00,410
greater sense of oneself.
I mean,

535
00:24:01,550 --> 00:24:04,370
sometimes libertarians,
I think objectives are sort of immune to

536
00:24:04,371 --> 00:24:05,750
that,
but,

537
00:24:05,751 --> 00:24:09,120
but not all libertarians are.
Some Libertarians do what they do out of

538
00:24:09,121 --> 00:24:09,954
the,
out of the sense of what's good for the 

539
00:24:10,941 --> 00:24:12,050
community.
Um,

540
00:24:12,051 --> 00:24:13,100
I,
uh,

541
00:24:13,130 --> 00:24:13,963
maybe,
maybe this is what I would say was 

542
00:24:15,101 --> 00:24:15,934
selfish,
but I actually do want to see humanity 

543
00:24:17,570 --> 00:24:18,403
flourish and thrive.
I just simply don't believe that 

544
00:24:19,821 --> 00:24:21,470
government is the best way for us to do 
that.

545
00:24:21,510 --> 00:24:22,343
Yeah.
So I don't see actually a major 

546
00:24:23,691 --> 00:24:26,300
distinction there from,
from what you would believe,

547
00:24:26,301 --> 00:24:27,134
as opposed to an objectivist because 
doing for yourself what is selfishly 

548
00:24:30,441 --> 00:24:32,060
good.
I always view that as,

549
00:24:32,061 --> 00:24:32,894
that's not necessarily gonna hurt your 
neighbor because if you're smart and 

550
00:24:34,571 --> 00:24:35,404
you're doing what's good for you,
you're not going to be dumping in your 

551
00:24:37,371 --> 00:24:39,500
neighbor's lawn because you want your 
neighbor to be happy too.

552
00:24:39,500 --> 00:24:40,333
So like sometimes don't you just do good
thing for people even though it doesn't 

553
00:24:43,491 --> 00:24:44,360
benefit you.
I mean,

554
00:24:44,361 --> 00:24:45,770
yeah,
it may make you feel good,

555
00:24:46,010 --> 00:24:46,843
but every once in a while I catch myself
just doing things for people like 

556
00:24:48,981 --> 00:24:51,410
opening a door,
handing a quarter to a homeless person,

557
00:24:51,420 --> 00:24:52,253
right?
Somebody my phone to use or something 

558
00:24:53,661 --> 00:24:54,890
like that.
Just not big.

559
00:24:54,980 --> 00:24:57,290
And like sometimes I don't derive any 
pleasure from it.

560
00:24:57,291 --> 00:24:59,320
I just do it automatically.
So then that,

561
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:01,280
then we're on the philosophical piece of
it.

562
00:25:01,281 --> 00:25:02,114
Is that somehow actually for you,
which it almost to me it's almost 

563
00:25:05,241 --> 00:25:07,750
irrelevant in a sort of real world.
Right?

564
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:11,840
That's probably my biggest issue with 
objectivist is just simply the,

565
00:25:11,870 --> 00:25:12,703
the again,
that it's distasteful to me because I 

566
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:16,930
really disliked called some personality,
right?

567
00:25:16,940 --> 00:25:18,070
And uh,
and I just,

568
00:25:18,130 --> 00:25:18,963
I'm,
I'm a contrarian and a skeptic and I 

569
00:25:20,271 --> 00:25:23,480
just really like to pick things apart,
find the flaws in it,

570
00:25:23,481 --> 00:25:24,314
you know,
this is what gets you in trouble and it 

571
00:25:25,151 --> 00:25:27,170
gets you branded a heretic,
but you know,

572
00:25:27,171 --> 00:25:30,250
when you find flaws and you want to pull
the thread,

573
00:25:30,260 --> 00:25:31,093
eventually sweater comes apart just 
because I like to see what things are 

574
00:25:32,901 --> 00:25:33,650
made of.

575
00:25:33,650 --> 00:25:34,483
Right.
And I don't like to accept things just 

576
00:25:35,601 --> 00:25:38,990
because this Marie Rothbart,
senator Iran set it right.

577
00:25:38,991 --> 00:25:40,720
Or Ron Paul said it,
you know,

578
00:25:40,730 --> 00:25:43,760
now it just angered the.
Everybody else appreciate.

579
00:25:43,850 --> 00:25:45,650
I normally don't have a list of people 
to anger,

580
00:25:45,651 --> 00:25:46,484
but I feel like I should have had a 
little Glen Beck whiteboard here and I 

581
00:25:48,900 --> 00:25:50,510
could just knock it all.
We haven't,

582
00:25:50,511 --> 00:25:52,650
we haven't hit feminists,
sjws patients.

583
00:25:52,660 --> 00:25:54,290
Patients will get there.
Okay.

584
00:25:54,291 --> 00:25:56,750
So we've taken back a lot of this stuff 
with government.

585
00:25:56,751 --> 00:26:00,440
We've taken back all of those things.
Do you think that's actually possible?

586
00:26:00,740 --> 00:26:01,573
Like is that the government too big at 
this point and our people to dumb down 

587
00:26:06,410 --> 00:26:09,680
to understand why big government is in 
important.

588
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:11,900
So for example,
when I hear a lot of progressive saying,

589
00:26:11,901 --> 00:26:12,734
you know that it just the government 
should redistribute and all of these 

590
00:26:15,651 --> 00:26:19,640
government programs and they get upset 
when we cut money to the arts.

591
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:20,473
I don't think that's going to stop art 
and I think it actually might help art 

592
00:26:23,820 --> 00:26:24,653
that,
but we've just become so numb to how 

593
00:26:26,451 --> 00:26:29,510
things work that if you were to try to 
reverse some of this stuff,

594
00:26:29,540 --> 00:26:30,373
you might do some really irreparable 
damage in ways that maybe we can't even 

595
00:26:33,441 --> 00:26:34,470
see.
Well,

596
00:26:34,590 --> 00:26:36,350
at the risk of sounding like a founding 
father,

597
00:26:36,410 --> 00:26:40,450
I'm going to call Tj and say,
and we should've been doing this.

598
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:45,180
The natural tendency is for government 
to grow in liberty to shrink.

599
00:26:45,570 --> 00:26:48,330
So do I think we can go back?
I think we can.

600
00:26:48,331 --> 00:26:50,430
The only problem is,
is that we have to adopt,

601
00:26:50,670 --> 00:26:52,050
not the,
not the principles,

602
00:26:52,051 --> 00:26:52,884
but the tactics of some of our opponents
were the Fabian Socialists who want to 

603
00:26:55,531 --> 00:26:56,364
try and grow government bit by bit is 
we're going to have to try and fight a 

604
00:26:59,251 --> 00:27:00,630
war game of inches.

605
00:27:00,630 --> 00:27:01,463
Right?
And we're going to have to take ground 

606
00:27:01,860 --> 00:27:04,290
bit by bit,
so I do think that we can go back.

607
00:27:04,291 --> 00:27:05,780
But the problem is,
is that with,

608
00:27:05,820 --> 00:27:06,653
with my movement,
the Liberty Movement is that we're not 

609
00:27:08,641 --> 00:27:10,590
content with small games,
right?

610
00:27:10,591 --> 00:27:11,424
We want to see big games.
We want to start seeing major victories 

611
00:27:14,101 --> 00:27:17,640
because we see our opponents getting 
major victories all the time and I think

612
00:27:17,641 --> 00:27:19,110
we've got to be a little bit more 
patient.

613
00:27:19,111 --> 00:27:20,110
We've got to fight,
you know,

614
00:27:20,230 --> 00:27:24,450
on the short game before we can worry 
about the long game in some ways.

615
00:27:24,780 --> 00:27:26,640
Why doesn't the party do anything down 
ticket?

616
00:27:26,670 --> 00:27:31,380
Why is it that you only hear about 
libertarians come national election time

617
00:27:31,381 --> 00:27:33,750
and as far as I know there is.
Are there any,

618
00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:38,220
there must be some randomly avowed 
libertarians in there.

619
00:27:38,250 --> 00:27:40,110
It's just that we,
we sort of.

620
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:41,273
There's not a lot of incentives because 
when you run as a like a senator or a 

621
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:47,470
president as a libertarian a,
you're,

622
00:27:47,480 --> 00:27:51,090
you're going to get the same amount of 
hell that you're going to get if you run

623
00:27:51,091 --> 00:27:52,020
for lower office.

624
00:27:52,260 --> 00:27:55,260
But at least there's the benefit of 
getting a little bit of notoriety,

625
00:27:55,261 --> 00:27:56,310
right?
A little bit of fame,

626
00:27:56,311 --> 00:27:58,950
perhaps a little bit of opportunity to 
advance your ideas.

627
00:27:59,190 --> 00:28:00,960
I mean,
when you're running for the,

628
00:28:00,990 --> 00:28:01,823
for the dog catcher as a libertarian,
you're going to get the same amount of 

629
00:28:05,011 --> 00:28:07,230
hell,
but it's your neighbor next door that is

630
00:28:07,231 --> 00:28:08,064
going to give it to you.
So I think that the incentives are 

631
00:28:09,871 --> 00:28:10,990
probably,
you know,

632
00:28:11,220 --> 00:28:13,260
messed up there.
And also we just,

633
00:28:13,270 --> 00:28:14,103
um,
I think there's just a lot of people 

634
00:28:14,521 --> 00:28:16,020
don't know what it means to be a 
libertarian.

635
00:28:16,050 --> 00:28:17,880
A lot of people who will,
you know,

636
00:28:17,940 --> 00:28:20,160
Bill Maher says he's a libertarian,
right?

637
00:28:20,161 --> 00:28:21,960
And uh,
what's the guy,

638
00:28:21,961 --> 00:28:22,740
the,
uh,

639
00:28:22,740 --> 00:28:25,920
John Bolton Ambassador,
John Bolton came on my show once and was

640
00:28:25,921 --> 00:28:27,540
like,
I'm a libertarian,

641
00:28:27,570 --> 00:28:31,290
really invade Russia because actually 
he,

642
00:28:31,650 --> 00:28:34,930
I think of it more as a neocon a well 
to,

643
00:28:35,070 --> 00:28:37,510
to some neo constant,
this is going to make more people angry.

644
00:28:37,680 --> 00:28:38,513
But here's some neo-cons they actually 
consider themselves anarchists in a 

645
00:28:40,861 --> 00:28:42,210
sense,
no borders,

646
00:28:42,211 --> 00:28:44,460
right?
And that if we see somebody,

647
00:28:44,490 --> 00:28:45,570
uh,
if we,

648
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:49,020
if we see somebody like a genocide going
on overseas and things like that,

649
00:28:49,260 --> 00:28:50,093
Wellesley,
if we believe in a borderless world and 

650
00:28:51,091 --> 00:28:52,740
these are all humans members of the 
human race,

651
00:28:52,741 --> 00:28:53,574
why should we not intervene overseas?
I mean a lot of Democrats agree with 

652
00:28:55,981 --> 00:28:56,700
that,
right?

653
00:28:56,700 --> 00:29:00,120
That we should be stepping into Darfur 
in Sudan and Yemen and,

654
00:29:00,121 --> 00:29:01,160
and we should be,
you know,

655
00:29:01,500 --> 00:29:03,930
having humanitarian interventions around
the world.

656
00:29:04,140 --> 00:29:04,973
And so the neoconservatives in some ways
think of themselves as libertarian 

657
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:12,810
humanitarians and in some way because by
bringing democracy to the Middle East,

658
00:29:13,110 --> 00:29:15,840
they are spreading freedom around the 
world.

659
00:29:15,841 --> 00:29:17,420
And that's their thought.
The only problem is,

660
00:29:17,421 --> 00:29:19,440
is that you buy in using government for 
this,

661
00:29:19,650 --> 00:29:20,370
you know,
they,

662
00:29:20,370 --> 00:29:21,600
they're,
they're ends,

663
00:29:21,601 --> 00:29:24,000
may be positive,
but the means that they,

664
00:29:24,030 --> 00:29:25,650
that they use end up,
you know,

665
00:29:25,651 --> 00:29:29,400
with the destruction of regimes and with
humanitarian crisis.

666
00:29:29,940 --> 00:29:30,773
So what do,
what would your position beyond that 

667
00:29:32,991 --> 00:29:35,850
that I know that obviously you wouldn't 
be for nation building,

668
00:29:36,060 --> 00:29:36,893
but in the case of a,
of a true genocide or a case of what's 

669
00:29:40,111 --> 00:29:40,944
happening in Syria now?
I think the general libertarian ideas 

670
00:29:44,230 --> 00:29:47,330
thought of as isolationists,
where do you fall in some sense the,

671
00:29:47,350 --> 00:29:48,183
the,
some of the returns are isolationists 

672
00:29:49,511 --> 00:29:50,344
actually many of the,
that's more of a Paleo conservative 

673
00:29:52,241 --> 00:29:54,280
thing that people who want to build a 
wall on the southern border,

674
00:29:54,281 --> 00:29:56,020
right?
And they want to stop trade overseas.

675
00:29:56,060 --> 00:29:58,180
Those are,
those people are much more isolationist.

676
00:29:58,181 --> 00:29:59,014
But,
um,

677
00:29:59,230 --> 00:29:59,671
uh,
there,

678
00:29:59,671 --> 00:30:04,210
there are ways to solve these problems 
and if you're going to use government to

679
00:30:04,211 --> 00:30:07,510
solve foreign policy problems,
you should use the constitution.

680
00:30:07,540 --> 00:30:08,500
That's really what it is.
And,

681
00:30:08,501 --> 00:30:11,230
and the problem is,
is that we ignore the constitution.

682
00:30:11,770 --> 00:30:13,420
The constitution actually gives.

683
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:15,190
And Libertarians don't talk this up 
enough.

684
00:30:15,191 --> 00:30:16,024
The constitution does give the congress 
some authorization to act in a manner 

685
00:30:20,111 --> 00:30:20,944
that would make liberals very angry,
which is that it would allow the 

686
00:30:24,520 --> 00:30:26,800
congress to lay a letter of mark and 
reprisal.

687
00:30:27,010 --> 00:30:29,260
The last time they did that was the war 
of 1812.

688
00:30:29,290 --> 00:30:31,720
So international laws and norms have 
changed.

689
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:32,800
So,
um,

690
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:35,050
if it's a,
if it's a terrorist activity,

691
00:30:35,110 --> 00:30:37,360
essentially it would be something 
similar to how you,

692
00:30:37,410 --> 00:30:38,243
uh,
how we dealt with a Sama bin Ladin 

693
00:30:39,660 --> 00:30:42,010
because we have such a deep and profound
sense of patriotism.

694
00:30:42,011 --> 00:30:42,844
United States.
We think only the government can kill 

695
00:30:43,931 --> 00:30:44,764
terrorists,
were not willing to get go all 1776 on 

696
00:30:48,311 --> 00:30:51,880
that bus and higher a higher merck,
which is really what we're talking about

697
00:30:51,881 --> 00:30:53,680
here.
So in a case like that,

698
00:30:53,681 --> 00:30:57,100
like I've been lied in type case,
you would actually be for that you hire,

699
00:30:57,400 --> 00:30:58,233
you're basically subcontracting 
contracting our army out and it's 

700
00:31:01,390 --> 00:31:02,320
probably,
you would argue,

701
00:31:02,321 --> 00:31:03,154
I assume be would be a cheaper and more 
effective way to Ron Paul after nine 

702
00:31:06,791 --> 00:31:09,210
slash 11 actually introduced legislation
to,

703
00:31:09,330 --> 00:31:10,163
uh,
to go into kill bin Laden using letters 

704
00:31:12,371 --> 00:31:13,204
of mark and reprisal because at least 
we're following constitutional due 

705
00:31:15,570 --> 00:31:16,330
processes.

706
00:31:16,330 --> 00:31:17,830
A lot of libertarians,
uh,

707
00:31:17,831 --> 00:31:19,060
that,
um,

708
00:31:19,510 --> 00:31:20,343
that don't agree with the authorization 
for the use of military force have to 

709
00:31:23,351 --> 00:31:26,680
admit that that was quote unquote a 
congressional authorization.

710
00:31:26,940 --> 00:31:27,773
And,
and the real problem that we were 

711
00:31:28,750 --> 00:31:33,750
dealing with in terms of law of the laws
of war or that if we declare war on isis

712
00:31:34,481 --> 00:31:35,950
in some sense,
if we lose,

713
00:31:35,951 --> 00:31:36,784
we're legitimising them as a state actor
and in some ways we don't want to do 

714
00:31:40,211 --> 00:31:42,760
that.
So in order for us to behave in a manner

715
00:31:42,970 --> 00:31:43,830
that,
uh,

716
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:46,570
that is in conduct with constitutional 
principles,

717
00:31:46,750 --> 00:31:48,580
reviving Article One,
section eight,

718
00:31:48,581 --> 00:31:52,450
and the letters of mark is a way for us 
to follow constitutional processes.

719
00:31:52,750 --> 00:31:53,583
But the problem is,
is that liberals aren't going to like 

720
00:31:54,881 --> 00:31:55,714
this because if we're talking about 
privatizing the military and the 

721
00:31:58,091 --> 00:32:01,450
Conservatives aren't going to like it 
because it's not the whole bad ass team.

722
00:32:01,450 --> 00:32:03,490
America,
hail team six,

723
00:32:03,491 --> 00:32:04,930
kill them.
But we have the,

724
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:09,580
we've got thousands of former veterans 
who are out of work who would love to do

725
00:32:09,581 --> 00:32:12,790
the United States a favor.
And if you gave them a contract,

726
00:32:12,820 --> 00:32:13,653
one of the beautiful things about it is 
only libertarians are going to like 

727
00:32:15,161 --> 00:32:15,994
this,
is that any bounty that they capture 

728
00:32:17,921 --> 00:32:20,680
over there can be brought back and sold 
to the United States.

729
00:32:20,681 --> 00:32:24,190
So all of those guns that fell into the 
hands of Isis can come back and be sold,

730
00:32:24,191 --> 00:32:25,024
not in California where I'm from.
You could have a beautiful new military 

731
00:32:29,231 --> 00:32:32,130
grade weapon.
So when I hear you talk about this now,

732
00:32:32,131 --> 00:32:34,600
but I can go there intellectually with 
you for sure.

733
00:32:34,601 --> 00:32:35,434
And I like the idea is that this,
and especially if you route things in 

734
00:32:37,481 --> 00:32:39,340
the constitution.
Uh,

735
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:41,720
I love that.
When I hear you say this though,

736
00:32:41,721 --> 00:32:45,880
there's a piece of me going,
this sounds like Rambo or you know,

737
00:32:45,980 --> 00:32:46,813
it just sounds like some eighties movies
were still owner in where they got a 

738
00:32:50,331 --> 00:32:51,350
bunch of mercenary.

739
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:53,590
I'm pretty sure this was a movie.
Was this partly the rock?

740
00:32:54,140 --> 00:32:57,410
They get a bunch of disgruntled former 
military men.

741
00:32:57,411 --> 00:32:59,280
They come together and they find the 
guy.

742
00:32:59,281 --> 00:33:00,950
I think Predator was sort of about this 
too.

743
00:33:00,951 --> 00:33:02,090
There's an alien that you're going to 
hunt.

744
00:33:02,100 --> 00:33:02,933
Right?
Right.

745
00:33:03,890 --> 00:33:06,980
But the idea of that,
that just sounds crazy to people.

746
00:33:06,981 --> 00:33:10,400
I'm not saying to you it's crazy,
but just so how do you even get there?

747
00:33:10,650 --> 00:33:12,680
Well,
new ideas or they always sound crazy,

748
00:33:12,710 --> 00:33:15,110
right?
Like legalizing marijuana 30,

749
00:33:15,111 --> 00:33:17,010
40 years ago,
you're crazy,

750
00:33:17,011 --> 00:33:18,260
you're stupid,
you're a stoner,

751
00:33:18,261 --> 00:33:18,531
blah,
blah,

752
00:33:18,531 --> 00:33:19,364
blah,
and now we see that things start to 

753
00:33:20,271 --> 00:33:21,104
change.
Right?

754
00:33:21,110 --> 00:33:22,670
And you know,
crazy people.

755
00:33:22,671 --> 00:33:23,504
Like the problem with this is,
is that is that there's this really 

756
00:33:27,501 --> 00:33:29,330
great quote where somebody used the 
other day on twitter,

757
00:33:29,331 --> 00:33:33,590
they said that I'm a smart people sound 
like crazy people to stupid people.

758
00:33:35,020 --> 00:33:35,853
So.
So the problem may not be that just 

759
00:33:37,341 --> 00:33:39,200
because I'm an opinion is in the 
minority.

760
00:33:39,350 --> 00:33:40,600
That's wrong,
right?

761
00:33:40,850 --> 00:33:42,380
Most of the time whenever people are 
like,

762
00:33:42,410 --> 00:33:43,430
oh,
you're crazy,

763
00:33:43,431 --> 00:33:45,020
nobody agrees with you.
Well you know,

764
00:33:45,021 --> 00:33:45,854
maybe most people are kind of stupid,
so maybe you're the crazy ones and the 

765
00:33:49,311 --> 00:33:50,144
media is not helping that.
At some point you've got to be willing 

766
00:33:52,821 --> 00:33:55,130
to put your foot in the ground and take 
a stand and say,

767
00:33:55,131 --> 00:33:55,964
I don't care if nobody agrees with me.
I'm going to take a stand on principle 

768
00:33:59,210 --> 00:34:00,043
and listen to the founding fathers did 
not put this into the constitution for 

769
00:34:02,301 --> 00:34:03,770
no reason.
You know why they did this?

770
00:34:03,771 --> 00:34:04,604
It's because the war of 1776 was 
primarily one on the seas by private 

771
00:34:09,291 --> 00:34:11,510
mariners.
There was no continental navy.

772
00:34:11,511 --> 00:34:13,700
There was something like maybe six or 
seven ships.

773
00:34:13,880 --> 00:34:16,290
There were over a thousand,
uh,

774
00:34:17,100 --> 00:34:18,950
who,
people who turned their merchant mariner

775
00:34:18,951 --> 00:34:21,980
ships into dogs of war.

776
00:34:22,130 --> 00:34:23,840
I mean,
this is the days of fighting sale,

777
00:34:23,841 --> 00:34:28,400
but I mean it without those merchant 
mariners turned a private tiers,

778
00:34:28,550 --> 00:34:30,230
we would not have won our war of 
independence.

779
00:34:30,231 --> 00:34:32,690
They captured hundreds of British ships.
So I mean,

780
00:34:32,720 --> 00:34:34,370
when,
when the going gets tough,

781
00:34:34,550 --> 00:34:37,070
sometimes you have to turn to the 
private market to solve these things.

782
00:34:37,310 --> 00:34:38,143
But again,
the reason why it's distasteful to the 

783
00:34:39,831 --> 00:34:42,980
establishment is for two different 
reasons that conservatives love it.

784
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:43,791
They're like,
oh,

785
00:34:43,791 --> 00:34:44,624
this is a great idea,
but we'll never get the liberals on 

786
00:34:46,621 --> 00:34:49,130
board.
And we'd much rather trust it to our,

787
00:34:49,150 --> 00:34:51,050
our Navy,
Navy seal team guys.

788
00:34:51,051 --> 00:34:52,520
And the liberals are like,
oh my God,

789
00:34:52,521 --> 00:34:53,990
you're privatizing war.
I mean,

790
00:34:53,991 --> 00:34:54,681
you know,
it's horrible.

791
00:34:54,681 --> 00:34:58,580
It's the free market and it's war.
So it's very hard to win that battle.

792
00:34:58,581 --> 00:34:59,630
But I mean,
whatever I do,

793
00:34:59,631 --> 00:35:03,650
I try and couch it in actual precedent 
law,

794
00:35:03,980 --> 00:35:05,600
the law,
the constitution,

795
00:35:05,900 --> 00:35:08,450
that way I think you remained consistent
and uh,

796
00:35:08,451 --> 00:35:08,931
you know,
again,

797
00:35:08,931 --> 00:35:11,840
new ideas are always sound crazy until 
they finally become accepted.

798
00:35:12,050 --> 00:35:12,883
Yeah.
So speaking of precedent and the 

799
00:35:13,671 --> 00:35:14,504
constitution,
what do you think of the general state 

800
00:35:16,731 --> 00:35:20,540
of the Constitution right now?
I think it's a pretty beautiful,

801
00:35:20,541 --> 00:35:23,330
almost perfect document to be governed 
by,

802
00:35:23,780 --> 00:35:26,960
but it doesn't seem to be what we're 
really governed by anymore.

803
00:35:26,961 --> 00:35:29,330
It's being trampled in every direction 
right now.

804
00:35:29,390 --> 00:35:30,223
You can make cases that trump's 
trampling it in certain ways with 

805
00:35:32,361 --> 00:35:33,890
executive actions.
And by the way,

806
00:35:33,891 --> 00:35:36,020
Obama did plenty of them and George W 
dot Bush did plenty of them.

807
00:35:36,021 --> 00:35:38,940
So that's a non partisan attack.
We also don't,

808
00:35:38,970 --> 00:35:39,803
you know,
we do military actions where we don't 

809
00:35:41,101 --> 00:35:41,934
get congressional authorization.
What was Libya where they call it a 

810
00:35:44,281 --> 00:35:47,430
Connecticut military action or they just
make up terms and you go,

811
00:35:47,431 --> 00:35:48,510
oh,
that's not a war.

812
00:35:48,810 --> 00:35:50,790
I'm pretty sure if Libya had been 
blowing us a bar,

813
00:35:50,791 --> 00:35:52,290
we'd call it a war.
Um,

814
00:35:52,710 --> 00:35:55,580
so the general state of how we are,
are,

815
00:35:55,581 --> 00:35:57,990
or are not governed by the constitution 
in many ways.

816
00:35:57,990 --> 00:36:00,750
I think we're living in a post 
constitutional republic,

817
00:36:00,930 --> 00:36:01,763
you know,
has some of the trappings of a 

818
00:36:03,151 --> 00:36:04,970
constitutional republic.
And you know,

819
00:36:05,110 --> 00:36:06,130
the,
the good thing is,

820
00:36:06,131 --> 00:36:08,930
is that the bill of rights still exists.
It's still enforced.

821
00:36:08,940 --> 00:36:09,773
I mean,
Congress uses the fifth amendment all 

822
00:36:10,621 --> 00:36:12,750
the time.
They've got people in there,

823
00:36:12,751 --> 00:36:14,370
in the hearings that are always having 
to plead the fifth.

824
00:36:14,870 --> 00:36:16,260
That's a big one,
right?

825
00:36:16,360 --> 00:36:17,540
And then they of course,
the,

826
00:36:17,820 --> 00:36:18,440
the,
uh,

827
00:36:18,440 --> 00:36:19,273
the supreme court relies on the second 
amendment when it upholds decisions in 

828
00:36:22,541 --> 00:36:25,230
like Heller or,
or McDonald versus Chicago.

829
00:36:25,231 --> 00:36:26,700
So,
so you've got the second amendment.

830
00:36:26,701 --> 00:36:27,534
I don't think anybody would know,
maybe some people would like to get rid 

831
00:36:29,371 --> 00:36:29,930
of it,
but I thought,

832
00:36:29,930 --> 00:36:30,270
yeah,
there's,

833
00:36:30,270 --> 00:36:31,560
there's plenty of.
But,

834
00:36:31,790 --> 00:36:32,623
but most people,
I think cooler heads will prevail on 

835
00:36:34,621 --> 00:36:36,150
that issue.
You've got the first amendment,

836
00:36:36,151 --> 00:36:38,640
which is in retreat in a lot of ways.

837
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:39,473
College campuses,
probably primarily the spots where 

838
00:36:41,761 --> 00:36:43,330
they're in retreat.
Um,

839
00:36:43,870 --> 00:36:44,440
and uh,
you know,

840
00:36:44,440 --> 00:36:46,710
it's also a retreat in some ways in the 
mainstream media.

841
00:36:46,711 --> 00:36:47,460
This is why,
you know,

842
00:36:47,460 --> 00:36:50,340
the Rubin report is probably so popular 
and successful,

843
00:36:50,341 --> 00:36:52,200
not just because you're so tremendously 
talented,

844
00:36:52,201 --> 00:36:53,034
but because,
but because people are seeking out 

845
00:36:55,021 --> 00:36:57,180
alternate means of information,
um,

846
00:36:57,181 --> 00:36:57,921
you know,
we don't live in,

847
00:36:57,921 --> 00:37:01,500
in North Korea,
so I can't say that the constitution has

848
00:37:01,501 --> 00:37:02,334
been a total failure,
but I do think that in some ways the 

849
00:37:04,141 --> 00:37:04,974
constitution was far from perfect.
I'm the founders tried to get rid of 

850
00:37:08,641 --> 00:37:09,630
slavery,
uh,

851
00:37:09,750 --> 00:37:11,370
at the signing of the declaration of 
independence.

852
00:37:11,371 --> 00:37:12,204
It didn't happen.
It took another 100 years and a bloody 

853
00:37:13,951 --> 00:37:15,220
civil war.
So,

854
00:37:15,260 --> 00:37:17,820
so there were some institutional 
problems with the,

855
00:37:17,870 --> 00:37:19,170
the uh,
constitution.

856
00:37:19,380 --> 00:37:20,213
And we've had a,
we had to pass the 13th and the 14th 

857
00:37:22,291 --> 00:37:22,950
amendment.

858
00:37:22,950 --> 00:37:23,910
Yeah.
And again,

859
00:37:23,911 --> 00:37:25,510
it took a war for that.
Um,

860
00:37:26,100 --> 00:37:26,641
but,
uh,

861
00:37:26,641 --> 00:37:27,630
I think that,
you know,

862
00:37:27,631 --> 00:37:31,500
if you look at postwar amendments,
you of course you've got things like,

863
00:37:31,501 --> 00:37:32,550
um,
uh,

864
00:37:32,551 --> 00:37:34,470
you've got the 16th and the 17th 
amendments,

865
00:37:34,471 --> 00:37:37,380
which have been the most anti 
libertarian parts of the constitution.

866
00:37:38,850 --> 00:37:41,870
Now we have a law by bureaucracy,
right?

867
00:37:41,880 --> 00:37:44,190
So,
so in many times the things like the FDA

868
00:37:44,191 --> 00:37:45,040
or the EPA,
they'll,

869
00:37:45,050 --> 00:37:47,760
they'll write law and enforce it and 
that was,

870
00:37:47,790 --> 00:37:48,623
that was definitely alien to the concept
of constitutional law is written by the 

871
00:37:51,541 --> 00:37:53,010
founders.
So with,

872
00:37:53,070 --> 00:37:53,903
with,
if you're going to have a bureaucracy 

873
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:56,273
then I think the bureaucracy should be 
limited to operating within 

874
00:37:58,501 --> 00:38:01,030
constitutional law,
but if they're to going to,

875
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:02,033
you know,
create laws and those laws should have 

876
00:38:02,941 --> 00:38:07,170
to be passed by Congress and they,
those laws or regulations in many ways.

877
00:38:07,430 --> 00:38:08,263
So that's really where the problem comes
is with all the executive branch 

878
00:38:10,290 --> 00:38:12,660
agencies that have been created that 
are,

879
00:38:12,690 --> 00:38:15,900
that I think are probably the biggest 
problem that we have for the record.

880
00:38:15,901 --> 00:38:16,710
I didn't mean that,
that,

881
00:38:16,710 --> 00:38:17,543
that in and of itself it's perfect,
but in terms of the way that we can be 

882
00:38:20,641 --> 00:38:23,310
governed as we humans are the ones that 
write this evidence,

883
00:38:23,490 --> 00:38:24,323
it's pretty close.
The best we've got because we've got a 

884
00:38:26,330 --> 00:38:29,160
CNA and we are flawed things that create
these things.

885
00:38:29,161 --> 00:38:32,640
So as perfect as maybe we can create,
but of course just a,

886
00:38:32,710 --> 00:38:34,440
as a,
as an independent thing.

887
00:38:34,600 --> 00:38:36,070
The thing though is that,

888
00:38:36,070 --> 00:38:36,903
uh,
for some reason the founders didn't 

889
00:38:37,991 --> 00:38:40,960
build a wall along the southern border 
so that,

890
00:38:40,961 --> 00:38:41,794
that can be improved upon because at the
time they would have been no need for a 

891
00:38:44,231 --> 00:38:47,550
casino down there.
All right.

892
00:38:47,560 --> 00:38:49,030
So you mentioned the EPA.
So the,

893
00:38:49,031 --> 00:38:52,750
the two ones that I hear all the tie or 
the fruit of drug administration,

894
00:38:52,751 --> 00:38:55,810
these are the two that you hear when 
people say Libertarians are nuts.

895
00:38:56,260 --> 00:38:57,093
Even Bill Maher,
who I know he half now identify as 

896
00:38:58,991 --> 00:38:59,824
libertarian,
but he's for a lot of big government 

897
00:39:01,180 --> 00:39:03,340
stuff at the same time.
Uh,

898
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:04,233
you know,
I saw a couple weeks ago he said 

899
00:39:05,591 --> 00:39:06,424
something about that trump got rid of 
this thing with the EPA and now they're 

900
00:39:10,241 --> 00:39:12,700
going to start jumping in rivers again,
is immediately what he said.

901
00:39:12,940 --> 00:39:13,773
And to me it's like we now live in 2017 
where everyone has a phone and if the 

902
00:39:17,291 --> 00:39:18,124
company a block away from his dumping in
the river or the smokes coming out of 

903
00:39:21,101 --> 00:39:24,040
their chimney or that everyone would 
report on everyone,

904
00:39:24,041 --> 00:39:26,250
that's another problem that society has 
altogether.

905
00:39:26,520 --> 00:39:27,353
Um,
but that we would police ourselves in a 

906
00:39:29,021 --> 00:39:31,420
way and as John Stossel who I love would
always say,

907
00:39:31,421 --> 00:39:32,254
you know,
the more regulations we keep putting in 

908
00:39:33,220 --> 00:39:34,840
companies,
just figuring out other ways to do it,

909
00:39:34,841 --> 00:39:35,674
we just keep putting money in lawyers 
pockets and we're not actually 

910
00:39:37,691 --> 00:39:38,524
accomplishing anything.
We're just shifting around bullshit 

911
00:39:40,031 --> 00:39:42,460
basically all over the place.
Um,

912
00:39:43,240 --> 00:39:45,280
so I can jump in on.
Yeah,

913
00:39:45,281 --> 00:39:45,781
go ahead.
Go ahead.

914
00:39:45,781 --> 00:39:47,200
So,
so two things.

915
00:39:47,201 --> 00:39:49,990
There's EPA and then there's the FDA.
So very briefly with the EPA,

916
00:39:50,250 --> 00:39:51,083
the EPA was created by Nixon.
It was created to essentially offer 

917
00:39:54,311 --> 00:39:55,144
scientific information in court cases 
where our property rights were in 

918
00:39:57,101 --> 00:40:00,640
dispute.
So the original idea behind the EPA is a

919
00:40:00,641 --> 00:40:01,980
good one because,
you know,

920
00:40:01,990 --> 00:40:05,800
Congress is a,
is not made up entirely of scientists,

921
00:40:05,801 --> 00:40:06,634
right?
It's mostly lawyers and lawyers aren't 

922
00:40:08,201 --> 00:40:09,034
environmental scientists.
And so you're going to need the 

923
00:40:10,271 --> 00:40:13,180
testimony of environmental scientists 
are going to need someone to actually go

924
00:40:13,181 --> 00:40:14,014
out and do the research,
find the samples and prove perhaps that 

925
00:40:16,221 --> 00:40:19,870
some company is putting too much mercury
or some sort of toxin into the,

926
00:40:19,871 --> 00:40:20,704
into the environment.
You're going to need science for that 

927
00:40:21,880 --> 00:40:23,800
specifically.
Not Be political though,

928
00:40:23,820 --> 00:40:24,910
right?
Not Be political.

929
00:40:24,911 --> 00:40:25,090
Right.

930
00:40:25,090 --> 00:40:26,800
And not to be the enforcement arm.
Right?

931
00:40:26,801 --> 00:40:27,634
Because right now there are a bunch of 
ventilated bureaucrats with assault 

932
00:40:29,351 --> 00:40:30,370
rifles.
Right.

933
00:40:30,371 --> 00:40:33,310
You've got the EPA,
I think the US Department of Agriculture

934
00:40:33,311 --> 00:40:34,930
has sub machine guns right there.
That.

935
00:40:34,931 --> 00:40:37,810
Right.
So they're checking the cows,

936
00:40:37,900 --> 00:40:40,510
you know,
there's a.

937
00:40:40,810 --> 00:40:41,643
When it comes to the FDA,
I actually think the FDA is an easier 

938
00:40:43,661 --> 00:40:47,860
case to make for the case of abolishment
because even though people think,

939
00:40:47,861 --> 00:40:49,390
oh my gosh,
well it's the things that we eat all the

940
00:40:49,391 --> 00:40:49,841
time.
I'm like,

941
00:40:49,841 --> 00:40:50,641
yeah,
actually.

942
00:40:50,641 --> 00:40:51,474
And if you haven't noticed,
people are much more conscious about 

943
00:40:53,381 --> 00:40:55,510
what they eat.
And uh,

944
00:40:55,511 --> 00:40:57,670
you know,
whenever I look at yelp reviews,

945
00:40:57,700 --> 00:41:00,220
perfect example,
every time you go and eat somewhere,

946
00:41:00,221 --> 00:41:01,870
I go and eat somewhere.
If I've never been there before,

947
00:41:01,871 --> 00:41:04,150
I checked the opera and if they're like,
it's dirty,

948
00:41:04,151 --> 00:41:05,470
it's got cockroaches,
you know,

949
00:41:05,471 --> 00:41:07,090
terrible service,
I don't go there.

950
00:41:07,330 --> 00:41:08,320
And,
and that,

951
00:41:08,321 --> 00:41:11,260
that's a market mechanism,
that's a regulation,

952
00:41:11,261 --> 00:41:12,094
right?
It's a free market regulation that 

953
00:41:14,051 --> 00:41:17,200
people use in order to determine whether
or not they should eat somewhere.

954
00:41:17,201 --> 00:41:18,034
I mean,
it doesn't take very long to figure out 

955
00:41:19,720 --> 00:41:20,531
that,
you know,

956
00:41:20,531 --> 00:41:22,420
some,
some food sources bad,

957
00:41:22,421 --> 00:41:24,940
but the problem is,
is that when anybody makes a mistake,

958
00:41:24,941 --> 00:41:27,470
which they do,
even the government can't even stop some

959
00:41:27,480 --> 00:41:28,313
of Salmonella from getting out.
It happens whenever somebody's child 

960
00:41:31,961 --> 00:41:33,100
dies,
you know,

961
00:41:33,380 --> 00:41:33,981
they say,
well,

962
00:41:33,981 --> 00:41:36,710
one death is too many.
Let's create an enormous,

963
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:40,820
a government institution for the 
children and we'll save all the kitties.

964
00:41:40,821 --> 00:41:41,654
And if you don't do this,
then you hate children and you want all 

965
00:41:43,761 --> 00:41:44,594
the children to die.
And that's why we have these 

966
00:41:46,611 --> 00:41:48,200
institutions.
Because as a politician,

967
00:41:48,410 --> 00:41:49,670
it's so much easier to say,
well,

968
00:41:49,671 --> 00:41:50,504
I'm for the children.
I'm for checking children's food and we 

969
00:41:52,881 --> 00:41:54,920
don't want them putting poison and 
baby's milk.

970
00:41:54,920 --> 00:41:56,090
Right?
Because yeah,

971
00:41:56,091 --> 00:41:59,480
because people really have an incentive 
to poison right these milk,

972
00:41:59,481 --> 00:42:00,314
right?
Because actually if you are a good 

973
00:42:02,241 --> 00:42:04,550
producer of food and you create clean,
healthy food,

974
00:42:04,610 --> 00:42:06,080
you make more money,
you make more money,

975
00:42:06,170 --> 00:42:09,770
whole foods,
they are making much more than the lower

976
00:42:09,771 --> 00:42:10,604
end retail chains.
So I just walk in there and hand them 

977
00:42:12,261 --> 00:42:13,094
all my cash because I'm like,
I know I'm not walking out of here with 

978
00:42:14,451 --> 00:42:15,284
any money.
It in some sense it's elitist and 

979
00:42:16,880 --> 00:42:17,713
because.
Because what they'll do is the people 

980
00:42:18,741 --> 00:42:20,360
who argue for it will say,
Oh,

981
00:42:20,361 --> 00:42:21,890
well I'm not worried about me.
Right?

982
00:42:21,891 --> 00:42:22,641
It's not me.
I can.

983
00:42:22,641 --> 00:42:25,340
I'm wealthy enough to check my food.
Like I have no problem with it.

984
00:42:25,341 --> 00:42:27,620
Like if I had a private agency that was,
you know,

985
00:42:27,980 --> 00:42:30,290
checking the food and had a stamp on it,
like I would be fine,

986
00:42:30,291 --> 00:42:32,660
but it's all the underclass,
right?

987
00:42:32,660 --> 00:42:35,240
Is the plebes that we need someone to 
take care of them.

988
00:42:35,241 --> 00:42:37,460
Right.
And it becomes a very elitist thing that

989
00:42:37,461 --> 00:42:39,350
we need to have the government because 
we,

990
00:42:39,580 --> 00:42:40,413
we need to have the really,
really smart people like about 100 or 

991
00:42:43,490 --> 00:42:46,670
two to two to 300 of them sitting in,
sitting in a room making these decisions

992
00:42:46,671 --> 00:42:47,630
for the Plebes,
you know.

993
00:42:47,660 --> 00:42:49,260
And that's,
and that's what it comes down to is very

994
00:42:49,290 --> 00:42:50,880
paternalistic.
I never thought of it in,

995
00:42:50,881 --> 00:42:51,714
in the whole foods concept.
But there is something really there 

996
00:42:53,781 --> 00:42:55,100
because you know,
if you go to whole foods,

997
00:42:55,250 --> 00:42:56,880
at least the one over here,
they've got,

998
00:42:56,881 --> 00:42:57,714
you know,
five levels of how they treat the 

999
00:42:58,881 --> 00:42:59,714
animal.
And one of the lowest is like free 

1000
00:43:01,251 --> 00:43:03,080
range,
which is still pretty damn good.

1001
00:43:03,081 --> 00:43:03,914
The highest.
It's like they took them out to dinner 

1002
00:43:04,611 --> 00:43:08,120
before and they drug them and yeah,
that sounded weird.

1003
00:43:08,120 --> 00:43:11,180
But that,
that's all done by whole foods.

1004
00:43:11,590 --> 00:43:13,270
It's by their policy.
Right.

1005
00:43:13,450 --> 00:43:13,791
But,
but,

1006
00:43:13,791 --> 00:43:15,530
but what,
but if they don't do it at Walmart,

1007
00:43:15,531 --> 00:43:17,850
you see the good and then the 
paternalistic cake like,

1008
00:43:18,080 --> 00:43:20,630
but they don't do that at Walmart.
Well you don't shop at Walmart.

1009
00:43:20,660 --> 00:43:21,201
Well,
well,

1010
00:43:21,201 --> 00:43:22,370
but,
but other people do.

1011
00:43:22,371 --> 00:43:23,690
And I care about them.
No,

1012
00:43:23,691 --> 00:43:25,070
you don't.
You don't care about them.

1013
00:43:25,071 --> 00:43:25,904
You're not charitable because you go and
you take a gun and you put it to 

1014
00:43:28,281 --> 00:43:31,100
somebody's head and you say you will 
make sure this fluid is clean.

1015
00:43:31,780 --> 00:43:35,210
But is there any evidence of a place 
where that was scale?

1016
00:43:35,211 --> 00:43:40,211
Like before the FDA existed,
were there a lot of stores that were,

1017
00:43:40,750 --> 00:43:41,583
you know,
I don't think people are intentionally 

1018
00:43:42,441 --> 00:43:44,750
poisoning tomatoes,
little grocer,

1019
00:43:45,270 --> 00:43:48,350
but is there any evidence that,
that it actually accomplished anything?

1020
00:43:48,950 --> 00:43:49,731
Yeah.
Uh,

1021
00:43:49,731 --> 00:43:51,030
I mean,
the thing is,

1022
00:43:51,031 --> 00:43:53,030
is that it's all about the incentives.

1023
00:43:53,060 --> 00:43:53,500
Right?
So,

1024
00:43:53,500 --> 00:43:54,333
so the question is,
do you think that people are 

1025
00:43:55,491 --> 00:43:58,790
incentivized to actually do good by 
their community?

1026
00:43:58,791 --> 00:44:01,730
Because the way that capitalism works as
the better you serve your community,

1027
00:44:01,970 --> 00:44:04,070
the more they,
the more money you make.

1028
00:44:04,071 --> 00:44:04,701
Yeah.
Right.

1029
00:44:04,701 --> 00:44:05,840
But um,
but yeah,

1030
00:44:05,850 --> 00:44:06,310
there,
there,

1031
00:44:06,310 --> 00:44:08,210
and there are always examples of,
you know,

1032
00:44:08,211 --> 00:44:10,880
just like there have been financial 
panics before the Federal Reserve,

1033
00:44:11,150 --> 00:44:13,030
but somehow instead of having great,
you know,

1034
00:44:13,040 --> 00:44:15,440
instead of having great depression,
it's like we did post fed,

1035
00:44:15,740 --> 00:44:19,190
we have these little short term blips,
little panics that happened in a year.

1036
00:44:19,191 --> 00:44:20,024
It cleans itself out and it's gone.
But now what we do is government steps 

1037
00:44:22,701 --> 00:44:24,640
in and any prolonged crisis,
right?

1038
00:44:25,110 --> 00:44:25,943
And exacerbates crisis because then you 
have to have tax payer money spent on 

1039
00:44:29,241 --> 00:44:30,021
the cleanup,
right.

1040
00:44:30,021 --> 00:44:33,240
Whereas before,
if there was like a food poisoning case,

1041
00:44:33,241 --> 00:44:34,074
right,
a local judge would have a judgment and 

1042
00:44:36,271 --> 00:44:37,350
they would,
they would,

1043
00:44:37,450 --> 00:44:38,370
you know,
exact,

1044
00:44:38,520 --> 00:44:40,890
you know,
tribute and they would bring it back to,

1045
00:44:40,920 --> 00:44:41,370
you know,
whatever.

1046
00:44:41,370 --> 00:44:42,140
The,
uh,

1047
00:44:42,140 --> 00:44:43,840
the victims were,
you know,

1048
00:44:43,841 --> 00:44:45,630
and there would be just compensation for
that.

1049
00:44:45,960 --> 00:44:48,380
But again,
it comes down to the question of,

1050
00:44:48,510 --> 00:44:50,970
of whether or not you think that some,
you know,

1051
00:44:51,060 --> 00:44:51,893
bureaucracy in Washington DC 
consensually plan all of the food and 

1052
00:44:56,641 --> 00:45:00,360
all of the drugs everybody takes in the 
United States.

1053
00:45:00,540 --> 00:45:04,650
I think it's Hubris to assume that a,
that people are smart,

1054
00:45:04,680 --> 00:45:05,431
right?
And Yeah,

1055
00:45:05,431 --> 00:45:07,080
you can get the best people in the 
world,

1056
00:45:07,081 --> 00:45:07,914
you know,
and put them in a little room and 

1057
00:45:08,520 --> 00:45:10,020
hopefully you're going to get some good 
ideas.

1058
00:45:10,021 --> 00:45:11,880
But uh,
but more often than not,

1059
00:45:12,450 --> 00:45:13,520
it's again,
it's,

1060
00:45:13,521 --> 00:45:16,590
it's Hubris because they think that they
can possibly play all of our allies.

1061
00:45:16,591 --> 00:45:18,970
They can't.
The definition of socialism is,

1062
00:45:19,050 --> 00:45:22,780
is central planning central control over
our lives,

1063
00:45:22,781 --> 00:45:24,840
right?
Ninety percent income tax rate.

1064
00:45:24,870 --> 00:45:26,850
You have no choice.
The state plans,

1065
00:45:26,851 --> 00:45:27,684
everything.
And that's really the road to serfdom 

1066
00:45:29,400 --> 00:45:30,210
essentially,
right?

1067
00:45:30,210 --> 00:45:33,930
It's a freedom is dangerous.
Freedom is dangerous as hell,

1068
00:45:34,320 --> 00:45:36,410
but I'll take her to stop poisoning our 
tomatoes.

1069
00:45:37,460 --> 00:45:38,370
And by the way,
you know,

1070
00:45:38,371 --> 00:45:40,020
with all this inspector stuff,
of course,

1071
00:45:40,021 --> 00:45:42,690
first off you can pay off and an 
inspector very easily.

1072
00:45:42,960 --> 00:45:43,793
There's so many little ways around it.
It reminds me a little bit when like 

1073
00:45:45,660 --> 00:45:46,493
when I was a kid and I went to sleep 
away camp and the date and the camp 

1074
00:45:48,781 --> 00:45:49,614
would be like a disaster for three weeks
and we were like swimming in sewage the 

1075
00:45:52,471 --> 00:45:54,300
day before visiting day when the parents
are coming.

1076
00:45:54,450 --> 00:45:55,780
They cleaned up the whole freaking 
place.

1077
00:45:55,781 --> 00:45:56,910
Yeah.
And it looks good.

1078
00:45:56,911 --> 00:45:57,930
Parents come,
they're happy,

1079
00:45:57,931 --> 00:45:59,070
and then they leave.
Next thing you know,

1080
00:45:59,071 --> 00:46:01,640
next day we have license,
right?

1081
00:46:01,830 --> 00:46:02,663
But the difference between a private 
inspector and a state inspector is that 

1082
00:46:05,041 --> 00:46:07,440
if the at both both have a tendency to 
be corrupt,

1083
00:46:07,680 --> 00:46:09,330
but you can't fire the state inspector.

1084
00:46:09,720 --> 00:46:11,610
It was going to take an election or it's
going to take,

1085
00:46:11,640 --> 00:46:13,140
you know,
some connections in DC.

1086
00:46:13,350 --> 00:46:15,300
Right?
But if you've got a private inspector,

1087
00:46:15,301 --> 00:46:17,210
then they are much,
uh,

1088
00:46:17,220 --> 00:46:20,640
they are much more tied to their 
communities and uh,

1089
00:46:20,641 --> 00:46:22,140
and again,
you can fire them,

1090
00:46:22,141 --> 00:46:23,850
you can prosecute them and the 
government will,

1091
00:46:23,970 --> 00:46:27,060
I will guarantee you he's going to step 
in and clamped down on that.

1092
00:46:27,061 --> 00:46:29,160
But if it's the government and you're 
trying to sue the state,

1093
00:46:29,220 --> 00:46:31,830
it's very difficult.
You briefly mentioned taxes,

1094
00:46:32,600 --> 00:46:35,880
let's do it.
Taxes is taxation theft.

1095
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:37,410
It's more like extortion,
right?

1096
00:46:37,411 --> 00:46:38,244
But it doesn't make for as fun a slogan.
It doesn't feel that I have a great hat 

1097
00:46:42,421 --> 00:46:43,260
that I,
that I sell.

1098
00:46:43,400 --> 00:46:46,950
It says make taxation theft again 
instead of make America great again.

1099
00:46:46,951 --> 00:46:47,784
And that goes really well,
but I didn't want to wear it in 

1100
00:46:49,021 --> 00:46:51,450
California because I thought they would 
think it was a trump hat and I might get

1101
00:46:51,451 --> 00:46:53,430
beat up even if you just wear a red hat.

1102
00:46:53,460 --> 00:46:54,690
I know.
Did you see this?

1103
00:46:54,691 --> 00:46:57,090
I had a guy that hated abby a couple of 
weeks ago that he wore.

1104
00:46:57,180 --> 00:47:00,780
He was wearing a nintendo switch hat,
the nude Nintendo and it's a red hat.

1105
00:47:00,781 --> 00:47:02,580
And he said people were telling him to 
go fuck himself.

1106
00:47:03,060 --> 00:47:03,930
Come on.
Yeah.

1107
00:47:03,960 --> 00:47:04,793
Well and yeah,
somebody got beat up and I'm in DC 

1108
00:47:06,721 --> 00:47:08,730
because it said a make bitcoin great 
again,

1109
00:47:08,770 --> 00:47:12,240
or something like that.
The left has gone a little bit nuts,

1110
00:47:12,241 --> 00:47:13,074
I think,
as you've started to detail on some of 

1111
00:47:14,521 --> 00:47:15,860
your videos,
but um,

1112
00:47:16,200 --> 00:47:17,033
when it comes to taxes,
a tax or the price we pay to live in a 

1113
00:47:20,341 --> 00:47:21,720
civilized society.
Just kidding.

1114
00:47:22,140 --> 00:47:23,180
Just kidding.
No,

1115
00:47:23,190 --> 00:47:24,170
like that.
You went to the camera,

1116
00:47:25,030 --> 00:47:26,930
triggered all the libertarians are 
watching.

1117
00:47:27,370 --> 00:47:28,470
Um,
uh,

1118
00:47:28,540 --> 00:47:30,270
taxes should be as low as possible,
right?

1119
00:47:30,310 --> 00:47:32,350
The idea is that you should keep the 
fruit of your labor.

1120
00:47:32,351 --> 00:47:34,210
That's the philosophical argument,
but the,

1121
00:47:34,240 --> 00:47:35,980
but the,
the technical argument is,

1122
00:47:35,981 --> 00:47:38,230
is the government wastes so much money.

1123
00:47:38,260 --> 00:47:40,480
They wasted money because they don't 
have an incentive.

1124
00:47:40,870 --> 00:47:42,970
Right?
I have an incentive to save money,

1125
00:47:42,971 --> 00:47:45,250
but if we go out to dinner tonight,
Dave,

1126
00:47:45,251 --> 00:47:48,430
and you're like Austin and I'm taking 
the finest restaurant in Los Angeles,

1127
00:47:48,820 --> 00:47:49,750
I'll be alright,
great.

1128
00:47:49,810 --> 00:47:54,040
I'm getting steak and lobster shrimp.
I'm going to get all the fixings.

1129
00:47:54,600 --> 00:47:55,433
Right?
And so there's no incentive for 

1130
00:47:56,081 --> 00:47:58,300
government officials to save.
So there's no,

1131
00:47:58,540 --> 00:47:59,373
there's no incentive for them to be 
careful stewards of the public's money 

1132
00:48:02,261 --> 00:48:05,650
in our trust and they build these 
budgets that they have to exceed.

1133
00:48:05,651 --> 00:48:07,620
Otherwise their budgets get slashed 
because people,

1134
00:48:07,630 --> 00:48:09,190
they didn't use the mic.
I'll take it in and out,

1135
00:48:09,191 --> 00:48:12,940
but that's really all in and out a 
secret menu though.

1136
00:48:14,350 --> 00:48:15,670
But yeah,
when it comes to taxes,

1137
00:48:15,671 --> 00:48:16,504
I,
I'm not a fan of the income tax just 

1138
00:48:17,681 --> 00:48:20,980
because it assumes that the money isn't 
yours.

1139
00:48:21,280 --> 00:48:21,610
Right.

1140
00:48:21,610 --> 00:48:23,200
It basically assumes that,
no,

1141
00:48:23,201 --> 00:48:24,034
this is our money and we're going to let
you have some of it as soon as we've 

1142
00:48:26,561 --> 00:48:27,850
taken out our share.
Right.

1143
00:48:27,851 --> 00:48:29,270
Withholding.
And uh,

1144
00:48:29,271 --> 00:48:30,760
again,
from a philosophical perspective,

1145
00:48:30,761 --> 00:48:31,594
I think it's,
I think it's just anathema to the 

1146
00:48:33,011 --> 00:48:36,370
concept of freedom.
We didn't have it before 19,

1147
00:48:36,371 --> 00:48:38,350
13.
Somehow the roads got built,

1148
00:48:38,440 --> 00:48:39,760
the roads did get built,
guys.

1149
00:48:40,080 --> 00:48:41,750
We had systems tariffs,
right?

1150
00:48:41,751 --> 00:48:43,700
But at least with a tariff system,
and I'm not a fan,

1151
00:48:43,780 --> 00:48:46,270
I'm not a fan of tariffs either,
but with a tariff system,

1152
00:48:46,271 --> 00:48:48,640
I mean you're in a sense you're paying 
for what you use,

1153
00:48:48,641 --> 00:48:50,130
right?
It's kind of like Gary Johnson's,

1154
00:48:50,250 --> 00:48:51,820
you know,
national sales tax proposal.

1155
00:48:52,090 --> 00:48:54,520
Right now you're just paying for what 
you use,

1156
00:48:54,521 --> 00:48:57,460
what you consume.
Which I think in some ways as a,

1157
00:48:57,461 --> 00:49:00,160
from a moral perspective,
I think it's better than an income tax,

1158
00:49:00,161 --> 00:49:00,731
which just says,
well,

1159
00:49:00,731 --> 00:49:03,820
what you have is ours and we'll let you 
keep a little bit,

1160
00:49:03,850 --> 00:49:04,683
little part of it.

1161
00:49:05,230 --> 00:49:08,830
I prefer a flat tax system.
I know that's controversial because poor

1162
00:49:08,831 --> 00:49:13,180
people pay a larger percentage of their 
goods and services,

1163
00:49:13,210 --> 00:49:13,520
uh,
of,

1164
00:49:13,520 --> 00:49:14,353
of their,
of their money into essential goods and 

1165
00:49:16,361 --> 00:49:17,280
services.
So,

1166
00:49:17,330 --> 00:49:20,090
so there is a problem with that because 
people say that's regressive and that,

1167
00:49:20,091 --> 00:49:21,520
and that is true.
And I acknowledged that.

1168
00:49:21,790 --> 00:49:24,220
But again,
if you really believe in true equality,

1169
00:49:24,280 --> 00:49:26,650
which we hear a lot from progresses,
if,

1170
00:49:26,680 --> 00:49:27,513
if we all,
if we want people to be equal in some 

1171
00:49:29,711 --> 00:49:31,960
sense,
then shouldn't they be taxed at an equal

1172
00:49:31,961 --> 00:49:32,990
rate?
Well,

1173
00:49:33,040 --> 00:49:35,470
the then they disagree and they say no.
If you make more,

1174
00:49:35,471 --> 00:49:36,304
you should have to pay more.
And I think that that creates big word 

1175
00:49:39,311 --> 00:49:40,144
here,
disequilibrium in the sense because 

1176
00:49:42,280 --> 00:49:45,060
because the people who are the most 
productive are,

1177
00:49:45,150 --> 00:49:47,680
are being harnessed the most,
right?

1178
00:49:47,830 --> 00:49:48,663
And the people who are the least 
productive in some sense are paying 

1179
00:49:51,191 --> 00:49:52,000
less,
right?

1180
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:53,890
So if we're all,
and that's not to say that it should,

1181
00:49:53,920 --> 00:49:54,311
could,
should,

1182
00:49:54,311 --> 00:49:55,270
would,
what's moral here,

1183
00:49:55,450 --> 00:49:56,283
but in some sense you're,
you're taking the people who are 

1184
00:49:58,061 --> 00:50:02,070
creating all of the wealth of society.
And this is the Randy and concept of,

1185
00:50:02,120 --> 00:50:02,953
you know,
here is that you're taking all those 

1186
00:50:03,761 --> 00:50:07,690
people and you're disincentivizing the 
cream of society.

1187
00:50:07,960 --> 00:50:10,360
And so I think that that's not the right
way to go about it.

1188
00:50:10,361 --> 00:50:11,194
You should.
Everybody should be taxed at the same 

1189
00:50:12,011 --> 00:50:13,330
rate for,
to be taxed at all.

1190
00:50:13,480 --> 00:50:15,550
Um,
and most of the taxes that we have,

1191
00:50:15,551 --> 00:50:15,960
I,
you know,

1192
00:50:15,960 --> 00:50:17,590
I think are just excessive.
But,

1193
00:50:17,591 --> 00:50:18,160
uh,
you know,

1194
00:50:18,160 --> 00:50:19,600
again,
it's not just the income taxes,

1195
00:50:19,690 --> 00:50:22,050
sales taxes,
property taxes,

1196
00:50:22,051 --> 00:50:24,700
you know,
you've got fines and fees everywhere you

1197
00:50:24,701 --> 00:50:25,481
go.
Trust me,

1198
00:50:25,481 --> 00:50:28,040
I'm a business owner now and I just did 
my taxes this week.

1199
00:50:28,041 --> 00:50:28,874
I know about a whole new slew of taxes I
didn't know about for the privilege of 

1200
00:50:31,731 --> 00:50:33,740
sitting in your home during this 
interview.

1201
00:50:33,950 --> 00:50:35,870
You have the government 15 percent.
Yeah,

1202
00:50:36,060 --> 00:50:37,120
it's unbelievable.
So,

1203
00:50:37,250 --> 00:50:38,083
so alright.
So you mentioned a flat tax and when 

1204
00:50:39,201 --> 00:50:41,760
people asked me about taxes and I think,
you know,

1205
00:50:41,800 --> 00:50:44,060
I've said for awhile as a,
as a liberal,

1206
00:50:44,061 --> 00:50:45,030
I haven't moved,
I've,

1207
00:50:45,031 --> 00:50:45,864
I've watched the left go off the deep 
end so it makes it seem like I'm more 

1208
00:50:48,621 --> 00:50:51,080
right even though I don't,
I don't think I've moved,

1209
00:50:51,081 --> 00:50:51,914
but I think I've shifted a little bit on
taxes which is I would basically be for 

1210
00:50:56,151 --> 00:50:56,984
some sort of flat tax.
I'm just gonna pick a number for a 

1211
00:50:59,121 --> 00:51:03,110
second and we can go backward and that 
let's say 15 percent flat tax and if you

1212
00:51:03,120 --> 00:51:03,953
made less than 50 grand you don't pay 
any taxes because you need the help the 

1213
00:51:07,521 --> 00:51:11,540
most and if you make over 10 million or 
something like I would pick at something

1214
00:51:11,541 --> 00:51:12,374
pretty high.
You pay another two percent and then 

1215
00:51:14,121 --> 00:51:16,040
maybe over $100 million to pay another 
present.

1216
00:51:16,040 --> 00:51:19,640
But something like that.
Does something like that make some sense

1217
00:51:19,641 --> 00:51:20,421
to you?
Yeah,

1218
00:51:20,421 --> 00:51:24,140
I mean for any reform,
the tax system that we have,

1219
00:51:24,141 --> 00:51:25,340
I can be reasonable.
Right?

1220
00:51:25,341 --> 00:51:27,690
Like I may not like taxes at all right 
there.

1221
00:51:27,691 --> 00:51:30,150
I just shout it from a,
from a just a simple like,

1222
00:51:30,280 --> 00:51:31,460
you know,
reaction,

1223
00:51:31,610 --> 00:51:34,150
I just despise taxes,
but um,

1224
00:51:34,310 --> 00:51:37,560
I think that it's time for us to have 
some sort of reasonable tax reform.

1225
00:51:37,561 --> 00:51:38,241
So.
So yeah,

1226
00:51:38,241 --> 00:51:39,074
I think that these kinds of,
this is the kind of solution that I was 

1227
00:51:40,401 --> 00:51:42,140
looking for.
The real problem is,

1228
00:51:42,141 --> 00:51:45,620
isn't with taxes,
it's worth spending because the spending

1229
00:51:45,621 --> 00:51:47,910
is just future taxes and we've gotten 
ourselves to what,

1230
00:51:47,920 --> 00:51:49,520
$20,000,000,000,000
in debt.

1231
00:51:49,570 --> 00:51:52,160
I mean when I was a kid,
every the Conservatives and,

1232
00:51:52,210 --> 00:51:53,043
and what are the,
the Democrats were attacking the 

1233
00:51:54,740 --> 00:51:55,573
conservatives in the Republican party 
because Ronald Reagan drove up our 

1234
00:51:58,131 --> 00:52:00,760
national debt to $144,000,000,000.

1235
00:52:01,130 --> 00:52:03,440
What is it now?
It's 20 trillion,

1236
00:52:04,220 --> 00:52:05,053
$144 million versus $20,000,000,000,000.
So we've gone into the twilight zone in 

1237
00:52:10,881 --> 00:52:14,900
some sense in terms of our spending.
And we take into trillion a year.

1238
00:52:14,901 --> 00:52:18,260
We spent 4 trillion a year.
That to me is a,

1239
00:52:18,261 --> 00:52:22,040
is a recipe for disaster.
So it seems fairly obvious to me,

1240
00:52:22,041 --> 00:52:22,874
and I'm not an economist,
but we're never going to pay this money 

1241
00:52:24,891 --> 00:52:26,390
back.
That seems obvious to me.

1242
00:52:26,391 --> 00:52:27,224
And that then unfortunately creates a 
situation where it's why we need a 

1243
00:52:31,461 --> 00:52:33,120
military.
You know what I mean?

1244
00:52:33,121 --> 00:52:35,180
That one day trying to,
you know what I mean?

1245
00:52:35,181 --> 00:52:35,671
Like,
I,

1246
00:52:35,671 --> 00:52:36,680
I don't,
that's just,

1247
00:52:36,710 --> 00:52:39,710
that just seems real world to me.
One day it's possible.

1248
00:52:39,711 --> 00:52:40,880
China is going to go,
whoa,

1249
00:52:40,881 --> 00:52:43,190
you guys are racked up quite a bill over
here.

1250
00:52:43,360 --> 00:52:45,230
Uh,
what are we going to do about that?

1251
00:52:45,560 --> 00:52:46,393
And then unfortunately we know we're not
gonna pay it back because we don't have 

1252
00:52:49,401 --> 00:52:50,234
the money.

1253
00:52:50,330 --> 00:52:52,190
And that's how you ended up in another 
war.

1254
00:52:52,191 --> 00:52:56,130
So in a bizarre way,
a debt brings war.

1255
00:52:56,260 --> 00:52:57,340
I think.
I mean,

1256
00:52:57,650 --> 00:53:00,350
the United States is defaulted before 
and it didn't go to war.

1257
00:53:00,351 --> 00:53:01,580
I mean we had,
um,

1258
00:53:01,640 --> 00:53:03,680
the,
the Bretton Woods,

1259
00:53:03,860 --> 00:53:04,693
a crisis of course,
that we had where we finally closed the 

1260
00:53:07,221 --> 00:53:11,870
gold window or no longer could you trade
dollars for gold internationally.

1261
00:53:11,871 --> 00:53:14,630
And then we did it nationally.
And in many ways,

1262
00:53:14,631 --> 00:53:15,464
this is a default because in some sense 
you're destroying the savings of people 

1263
00:53:18,351 --> 00:53:21,650
who had money back to buy gold.
And so these are,

1264
00:53:21,680 --> 00:53:23,490
these are defaults in a sense and,
and it,

1265
00:53:23,570 --> 00:53:25,300
it didn't cause war,
but in mean our,

1266
00:53:25,320 --> 00:53:29,220
our creditors overseas who wanted to be 
able to exchange their dollars for gold,

1267
00:53:29,550 --> 00:53:30,750
you know,
they didn't attack us.

1268
00:53:30,780 --> 00:53:32,790
So I don't know that it necessarily 
needs it.

1269
00:53:32,800 --> 00:53:36,630
It would necessarily lead to war,
but if we had a default in some sense.

1270
00:53:36,630 --> 00:53:37,950
But uh,
you know,

1271
00:53:38,430 --> 00:53:39,211
here's the thing,
I mean,

1272
00:53:39,211 --> 00:53:41,640
it's only $20,000,000,000,000,
right?

1273
00:53:41,641 --> 00:53:43,780
It's not 100,
$100,000,000,000,000

1274
00:53:44,070 --> 00:53:46,770
in the United States economy that we put
out $2,000,000,000,000

1275
00:53:46,771 --> 00:53:48,570
a year or two to $2,000,000,000,000
a year.

1276
00:53:48,810 --> 00:53:52,050
It wouldn't take that long for us to pay
it off if we would cut spending.

1277
00:53:52,350 --> 00:53:53,183
So.
So it's not that it's not feasible to 

1278
00:53:54,451 --> 00:53:58,260
cut taxes because I think everybody 
wants to cut taxes and everybody,

1279
00:53:58,320 --> 00:53:59,880
if you ask them,
would say,

1280
00:54:00,150 --> 00:54:01,980
can I pay a lower tax for the sandwich?
You know?

1281
00:54:01,981 --> 00:54:02,580
Yeah.
Well,

1282
00:54:02,580 --> 00:54:04,260
everyone says they'd like to cut them 
for themselves,

1283
00:54:04,640 --> 00:54:07,740
but there's plenty of people that would 
say I'd like them to be higher for sure.

1284
00:54:07,810 --> 00:54:08,643
Sure.
But if we could get some sort of broad 

1285
00:54:09,361 --> 00:54:10,194
based tax form,
let's say we do stocking to solve the 

1286
00:54:11,581 --> 00:54:12,414
problem because again,
any spending is just a future tax 

1287
00:54:14,551 --> 00:54:15,384
increase,
but if we could cut spending and then 

1288
00:54:17,611 --> 00:54:18,444
there are some proposals that have been 
put out and I put one out in my 

1289
00:54:20,821 --> 00:54:23,700
presidential campaign,
we called it the penny plan where rather

1290
00:54:23,701 --> 00:54:26,230
than try and kill elbow,
you know,

1291
00:54:26,240 --> 00:54:28,180
or,
or some special interests,

1292
00:54:28,200 --> 00:54:28,680
right?

1293
00:54:28,680 --> 00:54:31,050
You just make everybody take a haircut 
from the top.

1294
00:54:31,290 --> 00:54:34,740
And it was called the penny plan because
you'd cut one penny out of every federal

1295
00:54:34,741 --> 00:54:36,630
dollar across the board.
Right?

1296
00:54:36,631 --> 00:54:38,510
And then you would put in a,
a,

1297
00:54:38,540 --> 00:54:39,291
you know,
a cap,

1298
00:54:39,291 --> 00:54:41,970
a spending cap,
so like 15 percent of GDP,

1299
00:54:41,971 --> 00:54:42,960
right?
So that you wouldn't,

1300
00:54:43,140 --> 00:54:46,590
you wouldn't spend yourself into 
oblivion in the future.

1301
00:54:46,800 --> 00:54:47,633
Uh,
but I think that if you just give 

1302
00:54:49,081 --> 00:54:49,914
everybody a little haircut across the 
top and then you continue to do that 

1303
00:54:52,561 --> 00:54:53,394
every year,
those savings start to add up and I 

1304
00:54:55,801 --> 00:54:59,580
think that that's a reasonable way to do
it rather than inflame some,

1305
00:54:59,581 --> 00:55:00,414
the passions of the people who love pbs 
or the National Park Service and things 

1306
00:55:03,901 --> 00:55:04,734
like that.
If everybody has to take the same 

1307
00:55:05,311 --> 00:55:07,260
haircut,
just like if we're all taxed the same.

1308
00:55:07,261 --> 00:55:08,094
Right?
I mean that's really a quality in a 

1309
00:55:09,031 --> 00:55:09,580
sense.

1310
00:55:09,580 --> 00:55:10,500
Uh,
but it's,

1311
00:55:10,501 --> 00:55:11,334
again,
it's not necessarily politically 

1312
00:55:11,881 --> 00:55:13,720
feasible,
but new ideas got to get them out.

1313
00:55:13,760 --> 00:55:14,670
Yeah.
So That's interesting.

1314
00:55:14,671 --> 00:55:15,504
And that's actually consistent with what
you said earlier about sort of 

1315
00:55:17,401 --> 00:55:18,234
incremental things or how you would 
change things without burning down the 

1316
00:55:21,091 --> 00:55:22,170
system.
So in this case,

1317
00:55:22,590 --> 00:55:26,340
you're not taken big bird out to the 
shed and shooting him,

1318
00:55:26,370 --> 00:55:31,080
but I would get a lot more facebook fans
by said that would be a lot more popular

1319
00:55:31,081 --> 00:55:32,830
because you know it right now,
as you know,

1320
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:34,320
we could get in the media,
but I'll just tell you,

1321
00:55:34,321 --> 00:55:36,810
it's so polarized right now that,
you know,

1322
00:55:36,811 --> 00:55:38,790
if you're not with us,
you're against us.

1323
00:55:38,940 --> 00:55:40,590
If you're not a feminist,
you're a bigot.

1324
00:55:40,620 --> 00:55:44,300
If you're not a conservative,
then you're a stupid lip toward and,

1325
00:55:44,440 --> 00:55:46,530
and it's,
it's difficult to be.

1326
00:55:46,531 --> 00:55:48,060
I mean,
I don't,

1327
00:55:48,150 --> 00:55:49,290
I'm not a moderate,
right?

1328
00:55:49,290 --> 00:55:52,440
I'm a radical competitive admissions but
amongst,

1329
00:55:52,560 --> 00:55:54,720
but in the political world of today,
I mean,

1330
00:55:54,960 --> 00:55:55,793
you know,
I think I bore people because I come up 

1331
00:55:57,031 --> 00:55:59,460
with such simple solutions and say,
okay,

1332
00:55:59,461 --> 00:56:01,490
this is a path towards,
uh,

1333
00:56:02,160 --> 00:56:02,993
towards what we really want.
And Progressives can get on board some 

1334
00:56:05,461 --> 00:56:06,241
of these things,
right?

1335
00:56:06,241 --> 00:56:07,160
Gay Marriage,
you know,

1336
00:56:07,170 --> 00:56:08,003
liberal Liberals,
Democrats can get onboard those people 

1337
00:56:11,130 --> 00:56:13,050
who even like Hillary or Bernie can get 
on this.

1338
00:56:13,051 --> 00:56:14,700
And people who,
like Gary or whatever,

1339
00:56:14,820 --> 00:56:15,653
they're.
There are all sorts of solutions that I 

1340
00:56:16,831 --> 00:56:19,590
think has a broad base of support 
amongst the American people.

1341
00:56:19,780 --> 00:56:21,780
The people who control our politics 
right now,

1342
00:56:22,050 --> 00:56:22,620
uh,
on,

1343
00:56:22,620 --> 00:56:23,453
on left,
right are so toxic that he poisoned the 

1344
00:56:25,871 --> 00:56:26,704
well,
and that's why obamacare wasn't 

1345
00:56:28,421 --> 00:56:29,254
overturned.
Not because the house freedom radicals 

1346
00:56:31,151 --> 00:56:31,984
were in there,
but because the people who were in the 

1347
00:56:32,861 --> 00:56:34,390
establishment,
we're,

1348
00:56:34,420 --> 00:56:36,640
we're slapping it together and they,
I mean,

1349
00:56:36,641 --> 00:56:37,474
in some sense they were the radicals 
because they were doubling down on 

1350
00:56:39,311 --> 00:56:40,144
obamacare in many ways and then they 
start to demonize the opposition within 

1351
00:56:43,331 --> 00:56:45,790
their own party and the Democrats are 
just loving it.

1352
00:56:45,880 --> 00:56:46,631
But,
but,

1353
00:56:46,631 --> 00:56:48,250
but the Democrats have their own 
problems too.

1354
00:56:48,310 --> 00:56:48,791
Right?
All right.

1355
00:56:48,791 --> 00:56:50,260
So let's throw away some easy ones.
So,

1356
00:56:50,261 --> 00:56:52,550
medical marijuana and legalizing 
marijuana altogether.

1357
00:56:52,600 --> 00:56:54,270
No problem.
Sure.

1358
00:56:54,271 --> 00:56:56,710
About the problem with legalizing it is 
that you got to pay taxes.

1359
00:56:56,711 --> 00:56:57,251
So,
I mean,

1360
00:56:57,251 --> 00:56:57,850
I guess,
you know,

1361
00:56:57,850 --> 00:57:00,250
decriminalizing is where the anarchist,
but uh,

1362
00:57:00,370 --> 00:57:01,660
but yeah,
I'll take legalization over.

1363
00:57:01,661 --> 00:57:02,240
Nothing.
Alright,

1364
00:57:02,240 --> 00:57:03,850
we'll throw that one away.
Gay Marriage,

1365
00:57:03,851 --> 00:57:04,630
not a problem,
right?

1366
00:57:04,630 --> 00:57:06,280
Two people want to do what they want.
No problem.

1367
00:57:06,281 --> 00:57:07,390
Can I,
can I talk about that for a second?

1368
00:57:07,570 --> 00:57:10,270
Let me just say that I just trying to 
give you some easy ones to just love it.

1369
00:57:10,750 --> 00:57:14,770
But I am so happy whenever anybody finds
love,

1370
00:57:15,100 --> 00:57:15,520
you know,
and,

1371
00:57:15,520 --> 00:57:17,860
and it's just not set enough by people.
It's like,

1372
00:57:18,040 --> 00:57:18,873
what the hell business is it if somebody
else else's happy that the government 

1373
00:57:21,611 --> 00:57:24,520
should get involved in a contract 
between two consenting adults?

1374
00:57:24,600 --> 00:57:25,240
Yeah.
I just,

1375
00:57:25,240 --> 00:57:25,800
like,
I,

1376
00:57:25,800 --> 00:57:28,930
I never understood like I've seen on 
some level where some people,

1377
00:57:29,190 --> 00:57:30,940
you know,
they find discussed with it.

1378
00:57:30,970 --> 00:57:32,860
I never,
I just never felt that way.

1379
00:57:32,861 --> 00:57:33,900
Right.
And um,

1380
00:57:34,180 --> 00:57:36,640
I have just way too many gay friends and
family members that,

1381
00:57:36,641 --> 00:57:37,474
uh,
that I've grown up around that I love 

1382
00:57:38,950 --> 00:57:41,680
like crazy and I want them to be happy.
And so yeah,

1383
00:57:41,681 --> 00:57:44,260
when it comes to gay marriage,
it's not a gay marriage question.

1384
00:57:44,320 --> 00:57:47,020
It.
So does the state have have a prevailing

1385
00:57:47,021 --> 00:57:47,854
interest and telling people that they 
can't sign a contract and that's how I 

1386
00:57:50,201 --> 00:57:50,951
feel about it.
Yeah.

1387
00:57:50,951 --> 00:57:51,784
And that's why I've used that one as 
it's such a consistent example of where 

1388
00:57:54,311 --> 00:57:56,680
liberals and Libertarians can get 
together,

1389
00:57:56,681 --> 00:57:57,514
so you may be a liberal who just feels 
that this is the right thing to do and 

1390
00:58:01,001 --> 00:58:01,834
the liberal thing to do and you may be a
libertarian even though you said Nice 

1391
00:58:04,121 --> 00:58:06,130
things about,
about gay people and whatever,

1392
00:58:06,280 --> 00:58:07,240
but you may just be a libertarian.

1393
00:58:07,240 --> 00:58:08,073
He says,
I just don't want the government like 

1394
00:58:09,220 --> 00:58:10,053
this now.
Conservatives and Alabama or pushing a 

1395
00:58:11,771 --> 00:58:12,604
bill to get the state out of marriage,
now they're doing it because they are 

1396
00:58:16,331 --> 00:58:19,030
absolutely tired of the government 
stepping in and saying,

1397
00:58:19,031 --> 00:58:19,864
well,
we're forcing you to recognize gay 

1398
00:58:20,771 --> 00:58:21,604
marriages.
Right?

1399
00:58:21,640 --> 00:58:25,510
And so we may actually get a consensus 
on this because the conservatives are so

1400
00:58:25,511 --> 00:58:28,030
tired of losing these culture wars and.
Well,

1401
00:58:28,031 --> 00:58:29,530
the Democrats love winning.
But,

1402
00:58:29,531 --> 00:58:31,450
uh,
but I think that if we,

1403
00:58:31,451 --> 00:58:35,190
if we could get a consensus for it,
unfortunately now because of the,

1404
00:58:35,260 --> 00:58:37,690
the overfelt case,
which I still support,

1405
00:58:37,691 --> 00:58:40,480
but because of the overfill case,
it's now a federal issue,

1406
00:58:40,481 --> 00:58:41,500
right?
It's like abortion.

1407
00:58:41,810 --> 00:58:44,920
We just can't go back to a state based 
solution on this,

1408
00:58:44,921 --> 00:58:45,754
but if we can get people to accept an 
idea first that then we can start 

1409
00:58:48,671 --> 00:58:49,720
talking about putting it action.

1410
00:58:49,780 --> 00:58:50,613
Yeah.
And I suspect as with abortion it's 

1411
00:58:51,671 --> 00:58:53,890
going to just stay the way it is and I 
don't think,

1412
00:58:54,320 --> 00:58:55,980
but that remains to be seen.
Uh.

1413
00:58:55,990 --> 00:58:56,823
Alright.
So I gave you two basically is the only 

1414
00:58:57,611 --> 00:58:59,950
thing that we'll do to tougher ones that
we've sort of touched on here.

1415
00:59:00,220 --> 00:59:01,053
A second amendment.
So obviously I know you are a strong 

1416
00:59:02,921 --> 00:59:06,820
supporter of the second amendment.
Are there any regulations that we should

1417
00:59:06,821 --> 00:59:08,020
have on gun?
Well,

1418
00:59:08,021 --> 00:59:08,890
maybe nukes,
right?

1419
00:59:08,891 --> 00:59:11,410
So maybe you shouldn't be able to have a
nuclear weapon,

1420
00:59:11,411 --> 00:59:11,710
right?
No,

1421
00:59:11,710 --> 00:59:12,401
no,
we don't want to.

1422
00:59:12,401 --> 00:59:13,500
Kim Jong Moon.
Okay.

1423
00:59:13,540 --> 00:59:15,580
That might be the,
the tipping point.

1424
00:59:15,610 --> 00:59:17,080
Everything.
But nukes for the most part.

1425
00:59:17,830 --> 00:59:20,650
The problem is that most people think 
that if you,

1426
00:59:20,740 --> 00:59:23,990
if you make it legal to own tanks,
then like everybody's gonna own tanks.

1427
00:59:24,020 --> 00:59:26,690
Well it's not true because it's so 
expensive to own a tank.

1428
00:59:26,970 --> 00:59:29,840
I it,
you can't even drive it down the 10 feet

1429
00:59:29,841 --> 00:59:30,674
without the gasoline,
the insane gasoline bill that it would 

1430
00:59:32,631 --> 00:59:33,464
take.
And I was probably probably be illegal 

1431
00:59:35,271 --> 00:59:36,680
to drive that on the road too,
so.

1432
00:59:36,681 --> 00:59:37,514
Right,
so you don't have to worry that people 

1433
00:59:38,811 --> 00:59:39,644
are going to suddenly come out with 
tanks and this is going to make some 

1434
00:59:42,021 --> 00:59:42,854
people uncomfortable,
but you really need to understand that 

1435
00:59:45,561 --> 00:59:48,750
the revolution was fought by in many 
ways by militia men.

1436
00:59:48,810 --> 00:59:49,643
They,
they fought with military grade weapons 

1437
00:59:51,351 --> 00:59:52,184
of their time.
And so I worry about disarming the 

1438
00:59:54,540 --> 00:59:56,030
citizenry one day.
I mean,

1439
00:59:56,480 --> 00:59:57,313
liberals are now arming up by ultimate 
irony now the liberals all are talking 

1440
01:00:02,391 --> 01:00:06,150
about limits on executive power because 
trump is in power and create,

1441
01:00:06,250 --> 01:00:07,083
you know,
all of their screams of misogynists and 

1442
01:00:07,990 --> 01:00:09,590
racists.
And so now they're like,

1443
01:00:09,591 --> 01:00:10,850
well,
maybe we need to do about it.

1444
01:00:10,850 --> 01:00:11,683
Something about it.
One day they're talking about states 

1445
01:00:12,771 --> 01:00:14,300
rights because the sanctuary cities,
I mean,

1446
01:00:14,301 --> 01:00:15,610
everything's upside down now.
Right,

1447
01:00:15,650 --> 01:00:16,351
right.
And,

1448
01:00:16,351 --> 01:00:17,184
uh,
and so there is some irony there in 

1449
01:00:18,501 --> 01:00:19,101
that,
but hey,

1450
01:00:19,101 --> 01:00:20,270
if they agree with me,
great.

1451
01:00:20,840 --> 01:00:22,960
I saw some liberals were out like,
uh,

1452
01:00:22,970 --> 01:00:24,680
doing a,
a gun march the other day,

1453
01:00:24,681 --> 01:00:26,780
but then when we look closer they were 
carrying airsoft.

1454
01:00:27,120 --> 01:00:30,140
You guys might want to get some actual,
some actual guns,

1455
01:00:30,141 --> 01:00:35,141
but yet strong from support of the 
Second Amendment says arms for a reason.

1456
01:00:35,571 --> 01:00:37,450
Right.
So it's a bit of,

1457
01:00:37,500 --> 01:00:39,230
you know,
up to use the ideas is that,

1458
01:00:39,231 --> 01:00:40,460
you know,
the arms,

1459
01:00:40,461 --> 01:00:42,580
the definition of that would change.
Uh,

1460
01:00:42,700 --> 01:00:43,533
so I do think that citizens should be 
able to have that fully automatic 

1461
01:00:45,380 --> 01:00:46,970
rifles.
Like I want to live in a world where gay

1462
01:00:46,971 --> 01:00:48,890
married couples can defend their 
marijuana fields,

1463
01:00:49,220 --> 01:00:50,810
fully automatic machine guns.

1464
01:00:51,090 --> 01:00:52,670
That's a beautiful world.
Think about it.

1465
01:00:52,760 --> 01:00:53,593
You're giving me a lot.
They're happily married lesbians who 

1466
01:00:56,511 --> 01:01:00,080
grow marijuana and one day somebody 
comes in and wants to steal their stash.

1467
01:01:00,081 --> 01:01:00,801
I mean,
they can do,

1468
01:01:00,801 --> 01:01:02,930
they should be able to grab their ones 
and you know,

1469
01:01:03,060 --> 01:01:04,070
kick some ass.
Yeah,

1470
01:01:04,100 --> 01:01:05,600
that sounds like that should be on 
Netflix,

1471
01:01:06,240 --> 01:01:07,330
that show,
you know,

1472
01:01:07,540 --> 01:01:09,830
I'm all right,
but somebody's gonna hear that and go,

1473
01:01:09,831 --> 01:01:10,664
all right,
I've been with this guy is making some 

1474
01:01:11,661 --> 01:01:12,494
sense,
but I don't want my neighbor walking 

1475
01:01:13,371 --> 01:01:15,920
around with a bazooka.
The tank is obviously okay.

1476
01:01:15,921 --> 01:01:18,350
You can't afford a tank,
but maybe a save 20 grand.

1477
01:01:18,351 --> 01:01:19,820
I don't know what you'd call it.
Right.

1478
01:01:19,821 --> 01:01:23,030
But you know what I mean?
So how do you stop the crazy person from

1479
01:01:23,031 --> 01:01:26,060
just saving all their money and buying a
weapon that they could blow up at school

1480
01:01:26,061 --> 01:01:26,300
or.

1481
01:01:26,300 --> 01:01:27,133
Well,
you could tell you could get on the 

1482
01:01:27,951 --> 01:01:29,050
Internet and,
and uh,

1483
01:01:29,120 --> 01:01:29,953
you could build a bazooka for a lot less
than it costs to buy one because that's 

1484
01:01:33,921 --> 01:01:35,120
probably not the answer they wanted to 
do.

1485
01:01:35,121 --> 01:01:37,120
Probably not.
But that's the problem is,

1486
01:01:37,121 --> 01:01:39,380
is that people who want to do evil 
things are going to do it,

1487
01:01:39,410 --> 01:01:39,921
right.
It's,

1488
01:01:39,921 --> 01:01:42,320
it's a,
it's very easy to make a gun,

1489
01:01:42,380 --> 01:01:43,520
you know,
you can take a pipe,

1490
01:01:43,790 --> 01:01:45,620
put a,
put a shotgun shell in it,

1491
01:01:45,800 --> 01:01:47,480
hit it with a hammer,
that's a gun.

1492
01:01:47,840 --> 01:01:48,440
And,
uh,

1493
01:01:48,440 --> 01:01:49,580
so,
you know,

1494
01:01:49,581 --> 01:01:50,510
I,
I don't want to say that,

1495
01:01:50,511 --> 01:01:53,180
oh well we don't ban it ban something 
simply because,

1496
01:01:53,181 --> 01:01:53,950
oh,
it's,

1497
01:01:53,950 --> 01:01:55,680
you know,
it's possible to do it right.

1498
01:01:55,730 --> 01:01:57,500
We banned murderer for,
for good reasons.

1499
01:01:57,690 --> 01:01:59,420
Uh,
but a gun is a tool,

1500
01:01:59,480 --> 01:02:01,610
right?
It's just a tool and it's just,

1501
01:02:01,611 --> 01:02:04,250
it's only as evil as the person who 
wields it.

1502
01:02:04,420 --> 01:02:05,253
Like A,
an object in itself doesn't carry any 

1503
01:02:07,910 --> 01:02:09,430
morality.
Like,

1504
01:02:09,520 --> 01:02:09,980
like,
uh,

1505
01:02:09,980 --> 01:02:10,813
sometimes libertarians would get upset 
with me because I talk about drones for 

1506
01:02:12,921 --> 01:02:13,731
example.
And I say,

1507
01:02:13,731 --> 01:02:15,740
well,
a drone is again,

1508
01:02:15,741 --> 01:02:17,180
just a tool.
It's just,

1509
01:02:17,210 --> 01:02:18,043
it's just like any other tool and it,
what matters is that constitutional due 

1510
01:02:21,381 --> 01:02:24,870
process is applied when the government 
uses a tool like this,

1511
01:02:24,900 --> 01:02:25,733
right?
We like drones much better than we like 

1512
01:02:27,810 --> 01:02:29,280
carpet bombs,
right?

1513
01:02:29,281 --> 01:02:31,350
Because it's been more pinpointed.
Right?

1514
01:02:31,351 --> 01:02:34,230
But the ultimate question is,
is who wields the gun?

1515
01:02:34,260 --> 01:02:35,730
Who Will,
who has power to do it?

1516
01:02:35,940 --> 01:02:36,773
The finding is about liberals that kind 
of kills me are the ones who are the 

1517
01:02:38,731 --> 01:02:40,570
anti gun liberals,
is that they,

1518
01:02:40,770 --> 01:02:42,120
they say things like,
you know,

1519
01:02:42,121 --> 01:02:44,790
oh my God,
these cops are so evil and racist and,

1520
01:02:44,940 --> 01:02:47,760
and they hate,
they hate blacks but an only they should

1521
01:02:47,761 --> 01:02:48,594
own guns.

1522
01:02:49,600 --> 01:02:50,281
Right?
Well there,

1523
01:02:50,281 --> 01:02:51,870
I mean that goes to the heart of the 
argument,

1524
01:02:51,871 --> 01:02:53,790
which is always how corrupt and evil the
system is.

1525
01:02:53,800 --> 01:02:56,070
What's the answer?
Make the system bigger.

1526
01:02:56,110 --> 01:02:57,570
I think this system bigger,
right?

1527
01:02:57,571 --> 01:02:59,190
Hire more cops.
Right.

1528
01:02:59,191 --> 01:02:59,641
And I,
I,

1529
01:02:59,641 --> 01:03:02,610
you know,
I don't usually get off on seeing people

1530
01:03:02,611 --> 01:03:03,610
get harmed,
but when you.

1531
01:03:03,640 --> 01:03:04,473
It was some irony in occupy Wall Street 
and some of these definitions of people 

1532
01:03:07,621 --> 01:03:10,440
calling for more government and then 
they get government right in the face or

1533
01:03:10,450 --> 01:03:11,500
the pepper spray,
right?

1534
01:03:11,820 --> 01:03:13,650
You wanted more government and there it 
is,

1535
01:03:13,651 --> 01:03:16,610
right?
That that is the ultimate result of the,

1536
01:03:16,640 --> 01:03:19,670
of the call for more state intervention.
So.

1537
01:03:19,671 --> 01:03:21,180
So there is some irony there when you 
see,

1538
01:03:21,181 --> 01:03:23,390
when you see a leftist get bashed over 
the head by,

1539
01:03:23,460 --> 01:03:24,293
by the police truncheon that that's 
essentially what they're calling for 

1540
01:03:27,450 --> 01:03:30,390
when they say we need more regulations,
we need higher taxes.

1541
01:03:30,540 --> 01:03:32,880
That's the state because as Mao Zedong 
said,

1542
01:03:32,881 --> 01:03:33,714
you know,
all political power flows from the 

1543
01:03:34,681 --> 01:03:35,514
barrel of a gun.
And so you have to be careful about the 

1544
01:03:37,351 --> 01:03:39,190
use of power because it's,
it's fire,

1545
01:03:39,191 --> 01:03:40,620
it's forced,
it's not reason.

1546
01:03:40,800 --> 01:03:42,240
Yeah.
Abortion,

1547
01:03:42,930 --> 01:03:43,920
let's go.
Oh boy.

1548
01:03:45,120 --> 01:03:45,953
So I had a flip on this.
Not before way before I ever thought 

1549
01:03:49,021 --> 01:03:51,080
about running for office.
And um,

1550
01:03:51,120 --> 01:03:52,200
because,
uh,

1551
01:03:52,400 --> 01:03:52,970
you know,
I'm a,

1552
01:03:52,970 --> 01:03:54,090
I'm a secularist,
right?

1553
01:03:54,091 --> 01:03:54,430
I,
I,

1554
01:03:54,430 --> 01:03:55,263
uh,
believe in empirical study and data and 

1555
01:03:57,031 --> 01:04:00,180
science and things like that.
So I didn't have some sort of,

1556
01:04:00,181 --> 01:04:03,200
um,
some divine intervention that said,

1557
01:04:03,230 --> 01:04:03,931
Austin,
you know,

1558
01:04:03,931 --> 01:04:05,160
you need to believe this.
Right?

1559
01:04:05,161 --> 01:04:05,994
So,
but when I started to listen to some of 

1560
01:04:07,681 --> 01:04:08,514
the secular prolifers arguments on this,
I was convinced people like Christopher 

1561
01:04:12,900 --> 01:04:13,733
Hitchens,
and even bill Maher as has said at some 

1562
01:04:15,541 --> 01:04:17,490
point to express some sympathy towards 
the,

1563
01:04:17,760 --> 01:04:18,720
the unborn child.

1564
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:22,000
Uh,
and so the question in my mind is,

1565
01:04:22,001 --> 01:04:23,220
is,
is it a life?

1566
01:04:23,460 --> 01:04:24,293
Is it a human life?
I think the answer to that question is 

1567
01:04:25,801 --> 01:04:26,634
yes.
And then it gets down to the question 

1568
01:04:28,501 --> 01:04:28,710
of,
well,

1569
01:04:28,710 --> 01:04:29,880
when does life begin?
Well,

1570
01:04:29,910 --> 01:04:33,450
can I be intellectually honest and say,
I don't know because I'm not a scientist

1571
01:04:33,600 --> 01:04:36,960
and that I don't know everything,
but if I'm to make a mistake,

1572
01:04:37,200 --> 01:04:38,970
uh,
I would probably think it would be.

1573
01:04:38,971 --> 01:04:42,270
The moral question is,
should you err on the side of life?

1574
01:04:42,630 --> 01:04:44,700
So I think that yes,
we should err on the side of life.

1575
01:04:44,940 --> 01:04:46,200
Um,
and uh,

1576
01:04:46,201 --> 01:04:47,034
this is,
this is not a scientific or empirical 

1577
01:04:48,511 --> 01:04:49,290
question,
but my,

1578
01:04:49,290 --> 01:04:50,123
um,
my little sister is adopted and she was 

1579
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:57,590
slated to be boarded by her mother and 
we convinced her not,

1580
01:04:57,720 --> 01:05:02,370
not to abort and then we adopted her.
And so I think to myself,

1581
01:05:02,430 --> 01:05:03,091
wow,
you know,

1582
01:05:03,091 --> 01:05:06,030
like I'm so glad that she's alive.

1583
01:05:06,030 --> 01:05:09,480
And I say then I think about all the 
people who want children for adoptions.

1584
01:05:09,481 --> 01:05:11,300
Because while we were going through the 
adoption process,

1585
01:05:11,890 --> 01:05:12,723
that was 11 years old,
but I was learning about the adoption 

1586
01:05:15,211 --> 01:05:16,044
process and studying it and I realized 
how many parents just really want 

1587
01:05:20,141 --> 01:05:22,180
children.
So I think that it,

1588
01:05:22,690 --> 01:05:26,740
abortion for convenience is a problem 
morally.

1589
01:05:26,741 --> 01:05:29,170
I think it's a problem because I think 
that if you really,

1590
01:05:29,590 --> 01:05:31,150
if you really want to live in a moral 
society,

1591
01:05:31,151 --> 01:05:34,000
we should encourage people to adopt.
It's not to say,

1592
01:05:34,030 --> 01:05:34,690
Oh,
you know,

1593
01:05:34,690 --> 01:05:38,740
you conservative or liberal prolife 
libertarians only care about a baby once

1594
01:05:38,741 --> 01:05:39,730
it's born.
Right?

1595
01:05:40,060 --> 01:05:42,970
But that's not true because my family 
adopted,

1596
01:05:43,060 --> 01:05:43,893
right?
I know many parents who are dying to 

1597
01:05:45,971 --> 01:05:47,320
adopt children.
Um,

1598
01:05:47,321 --> 01:05:48,154
you know,
I'd like to have kids one day and if I 

1599
01:05:48,881 --> 01:05:50,830
can't have kids I'm going to adopt.

1600
01:05:51,210 --> 01:05:52,540
So I think that,
you know,

1601
01:05:52,660 --> 01:05:53,493
again,
with knowing that this isn't a perfect 

1602
01:05:55,901 --> 01:05:57,380
world and that,
you know,

1603
01:05:57,400 --> 01:05:59,800
we're never going to be able to just 
completely ban it.

1604
01:06:00,010 --> 01:06:02,590
Like,
Venezuela tries to do that.

1605
01:06:02,620 --> 01:06:03,453
If that,
I think that we can probably agree that 

1606
01:06:05,350 --> 01:06:07,750
abortion isn't a good thing.
Some people think it's a good thing,

1607
01:06:07,930 --> 01:06:11,360
but it's fetishized in a bizarre way,
but,

1608
01:06:11,450 --> 01:06:13,510
but I think most people don't think it's
a good thing.

1609
01:06:13,720 --> 01:06:14,553
Otherwise,
why is the stigma or the shame attached 

1610
01:06:15,851 --> 01:06:18,730
to it?
But I think that if that's true,

1611
01:06:18,790 --> 01:06:21,790
I think science is going to come up with
new ways for us to,

1612
01:06:22,060 --> 01:06:24,940
to save the kids of the life of 
children.

1613
01:06:24,970 --> 01:06:25,570
Um,
you know,

1614
01:06:25,570 --> 01:06:28,300
earlier and earlier perhaps that are 
going to be some options there.

1615
01:06:28,450 --> 01:06:29,283
I know a lot of Catholic charities that 
would spend millions of dollars to see 

1616
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:36,220
technology like that come to the light 
of day.

1617
01:06:36,370 --> 01:06:37,203
So I think that that looking to the 
future that abortion is probably going 

1618
01:06:39,781 --> 01:06:40,614
to become less of a problem,
especially because birth control is 

1619
01:06:42,071 --> 01:06:45,040
becoming so much more available.
And when it comes to the law,

1620
01:06:45,190 --> 01:06:47,290
the first things that I would like to do
when it comes to policy,

1621
01:06:47,480 --> 01:06:52,030
try and find the most non coercive way 
to reduce the amount of abortions.

1622
01:06:52,270 --> 01:06:53,103
The number one simplest way that makes 
some people very upset still is to just 

1623
01:06:56,231 --> 01:07:01,000
legalize birth control over the counter.
And that's,

1624
01:07:01,030 --> 01:07:03,700
that comes part and parcel with ending 
the war on drugs.

1625
01:07:03,920 --> 01:07:04,753
Um,
and so there some institutional 

1626
01:07:05,801 --> 01:07:09,100
challenges there,
but I think that abortion is wrong.

1627
01:07:09,190 --> 01:07:11,480
I think that it is a human life.
I think that as a,

1628
01:07:11,570 --> 01:07:15,730
as a society that we should protect the.
If government is to exist,

1629
01:07:15,940 --> 01:07:16,773
then its role should be to protect those
who cannot protect themselves and I 

1630
01:07:19,511 --> 01:07:21,340
think that that should include the 
unborn.

1631
01:07:21,640 --> 01:07:23,620
Uh,
but of course we have federal challenges

1632
01:07:23,621 --> 01:07:25,570
to that and we have court challenges 
with that.

1633
01:07:25,571 --> 01:07:27,660
We have stated challenges with that.
But I,

1634
01:07:27,661 --> 01:07:28,494
I try and make the moral argument 
because unless we can win the moral 

1635
01:07:30,041 --> 01:07:32,290
argument will never win the legislative 
argument.

1636
01:07:32,320 --> 01:07:32,850
Yeah.

1637
01:07:32,850 --> 01:07:35,700
Well I liked the way you framed the 
argument there because it's also nice to

1638
01:07:35,701 --> 01:07:38,760
occasionally hear someone say,
I don't know everything and you're not a

1639
01:07:38,761 --> 01:07:39,594
scientist.
And that there's an actual moral 

1640
01:07:41,251 --> 01:07:42,084
quandary here.
What did you make of a couple of weeks 

1641
01:07:44,460 --> 01:07:47,250
ago when Tomi Lahren came out and said,
you know,

1642
01:07:47,251 --> 01:07:48,084
that she,
using her conservative principles is 

1643
01:07:50,551 --> 01:07:51,384
actually approach.
I don't know that she said she herself 

1644
01:07:53,251 --> 01:07:54,084
was pro choice,
but she said that she didn't want the 

1645
01:07:55,711 --> 01:07:59,970
government basically legislating what a 
woman could do with her body.

1646
01:07:59,971 --> 01:08:04,350
I do see that as an intellectually 
consistent a position.

1647
01:08:04,560 --> 01:08:05,393
It may not be the conservative position.
It may not be the position that that 

1648
01:08:07,830 --> 01:08:11,730
Glenn Beck who I like and who's been 
chair believes and he did what he did.

1649
01:08:12,260 --> 01:08:15,770
God shows no longer on the blaze.
That's a whole separate issue,

1650
01:08:16,550 --> 01:08:18,990
but do you think that there is 
legitimacy to the argument?

1651
01:08:19,000 --> 01:08:19,840
No.
No.

1652
01:08:19,960 --> 01:08:20,420
The.
The,

1653
01:08:20,420 --> 01:08:22,010
the first thing that popped into my head
was,

1654
01:08:22,011 --> 01:08:22,844
oh,
she's had an abortion because three 

1655
01:08:23,931 --> 01:08:24,764
weeks before that she said,
I know there's a video from being a 

1656
01:08:27,351 --> 01:08:29,240
complete hypocrite here.
So something happened.

1657
01:08:29,241 --> 01:08:30,350
That was my first thought.
Then I was like,

1658
01:08:30,351 --> 01:08:31,550
well,
you can't prove that,

1659
01:08:31,551 --> 01:08:33,770
and then I thought to myself,
okay,

1660
01:08:33,771 --> 01:08:35,360
so what is this really all about?
Well,

1661
01:08:35,510 --> 01:08:38,630
if the argument is,
is that the government has no prevailing

1662
01:08:38,660 --> 01:08:40,970
interest in getting involved in,
in a woman's body,

1663
01:08:41,240 --> 01:08:42,073
well then can the government save the 
child if something's wrong with the 

1664
01:08:43,941 --> 01:08:44,930
mother,
if she's in a coma,

1665
01:08:44,931 --> 01:08:46,490
can the,
can the government take the child out?

1666
01:08:46,491 --> 01:08:47,970
Let's say the,
let's say that the,

1667
01:08:47,990 --> 01:08:48,823
the situation happens where the mother 
is life is actually in danger and the 

1668
01:08:53,061 --> 01:08:54,800
mother,
but the mother can't give consent.

1669
01:08:54,800 --> 01:08:55,633
I mean,
can the nurse then save the life of the 

1670
01:08:56,931 --> 01:08:57,764
Child?
But what if the mother at the time 

1671
01:08:58,401 --> 01:09:01,160
doesn't want the child to be born?
What if she woke up and decided,

1672
01:09:01,161 --> 01:09:01,994
oh no,
I wouldn't actually want to have an 

1673
01:09:02,631 --> 01:09:03,650
abortion.
Right?

1674
01:09:03,651 --> 01:09:04,484
What would the nurse probably not try 
and save the life of the child by 

1675
01:09:07,281 --> 01:09:09,950
default because she thinks of it as a 
baby.

1676
01:09:10,190 --> 01:09:13,460
When beyonce posted pictures of her 
being pregnant,

1677
01:09:13,730 --> 01:09:15,830
they,
the liberals were saying that,

1678
01:09:15,860 --> 01:09:17,030
oh,
those are babies.

1679
01:09:17,031 --> 01:09:18,710
Those are children.
Those are humans,

1680
01:09:19,040 --> 01:09:19,701
right?
But that,

1681
01:09:19,701 --> 01:09:21,500
but they're not babies.
They're not humans.

1682
01:09:21,810 --> 01:09:22,643
Uh,
but when it comes to the timing there 

1683
01:09:23,201 --> 01:09:24,034
and thing,
I think she probably just says whatever 

1684
01:09:25,131 --> 01:09:25,964
she can say to get traffic and clicks 
and God knows I've been so tempted to 

1685
01:09:28,701 --> 01:09:31,520
fall into her,
her example because you could make a lot

1686
01:09:31,521 --> 01:09:32,354
more money that way.

1687
01:09:32,510 --> 01:09:33,260
But,
um,

1688
01:09:33,260 --> 01:09:34,093
I think that when it comes to the 
question of whether it's consistent or 

1689
01:09:36,711 --> 01:09:39,050
not for,
for a government to intervene,

1690
01:09:39,230 --> 01:09:43,670
I mean even Gary Johnson who parades 
himself around as a pro choicer signed a

1691
01:09:43,671 --> 01:09:44,504
partial birth abortion ban.
So a most abortions do occur within the 

1692
01:09:47,721 --> 01:09:49,280
first trimester.
But,

1693
01:09:49,281 --> 01:09:50,510
but the real thing,
again,

1694
01:09:50,511 --> 01:09:51,344
when I said we're full circle here,
the most politically incorrect thing 

1695
01:09:53,901 --> 01:09:54,734
that you can say is that you should be 
personally responsible is that we have 

1696
01:09:58,431 --> 01:10:01,670
things called condoms and birth control.
And you are supposed to take care.

1697
01:10:01,940 --> 01:10:05,200
Because the problem with the liberal 
argument of freedom is,

1698
01:10:05,201 --> 01:10:08,690
is that I am free to not only,
you know,

1699
01:10:08,691 --> 01:10:09,524
destroy other people's lives and harm 
and create harm and have the government 

1700
01:10:12,920 --> 01:10:13,753
solve.
But I'm also free to self destruct and 

1701
01:10:15,381 --> 01:10:18,020
to make you pay for it.
And a prime example of that is,

1702
01:10:18,021 --> 01:10:18,860
is the,
uh,

1703
01:10:18,920 --> 01:10:21,110
like for example,
when the Supreme Court upheld Obamacare,

1704
01:10:21,111 --> 01:10:21,944
I was there the day that happened,
the liberals were unironically smoking 

1705
01:10:24,711 --> 01:10:25,544
cigarettes after it was over,
not because they were necessarily 

1706
01:10:28,491 --> 01:10:29,540
addicted to nicotine.

1707
01:10:29,540 --> 01:10:30,373
It was a side to the rest of us that I 
can do whatever I want and now you have 

1708
01:10:34,041 --> 01:10:35,450
to pay for it.
And uh,

1709
01:10:35,451 --> 01:10:37,400
you know,
there are people who think that taxpayer

1710
01:10:37,490 --> 01:10:39,310
funded abortions should exist and that 
we,

1711
01:10:39,450 --> 01:10:42,680
we should pay for those decisions.
But when it comes down to it,

1712
01:10:42,681 --> 01:10:45,590
if it is killing a child,
but it's killing a human child,

1713
01:10:45,980 --> 01:10:49,220
well,
shouldn't you be personally responsible?

1714
01:10:49,370 --> 01:10:51,140
Shouldn't you have been careful 
beforehand?

1715
01:10:51,350 --> 01:10:53,540
And then you know,
you've got the questions of rape and all

1716
01:10:53,541 --> 01:10:55,730
these other things that come into it,
which is always like a t,

1717
01:10:55,960 --> 01:10:57,020
you know,
we'd like to take tiny,

1718
01:10:57,021 --> 01:11:00,110
tiny exceptions to rules and then blow 
them out and conflict to the rules.

1719
01:11:00,111 --> 01:11:00,944
But again,
I don't know everything and the 

1720
01:11:02,240 --> 01:11:05,210
government cannot possibly legislate 
from Washington DC,

1721
01:11:05,211 --> 01:11:06,044
all of these problems.
Which is why I think it should be a 

1722
01:11:07,371 --> 01:11:10,700
state issue because I think from an 
administrative question,

1723
01:11:10,950 --> 01:11:11,783
uh,
the state should be allowed to 

1724
01:11:13,230 --> 01:11:17,130
laboratories of democracy in some way,
right when it comes to the war on drugs,

1725
01:11:17,131 --> 01:11:18,630
when it comes to abortion,
right?

1726
01:11:18,630 --> 01:11:22,050
Like if you're in Texas,
if the war on drugs was ended federally,

1727
01:11:22,200 --> 01:11:24,180
Texas might execute you for looking at a
joint.

1728
01:11:24,590 --> 01:11:27,300
I'm here in California.
It may be like they may have,

1729
01:11:27,301 --> 01:11:28,134
you know,
you can execute you for not smoking or 

1730
01:11:29,280 --> 01:11:30,310
not smoking.
Right.

1731
01:11:30,400 --> 01:11:31,233
So,
so that's the thing is that there are 

1732
01:11:32,341 --> 01:11:35,280
some problems with federalism,
but I think when it comes to issues,

1733
01:11:35,281 --> 01:11:37,890
especially with life and death,
that those things are better handled the

1734
01:11:37,891 --> 01:11:39,330
close to the,
the smaller,

1735
01:11:39,331 --> 01:11:41,310
the tighter knit,
the community so that it's,

1736
01:11:41,330 --> 01:11:42,163
it's so that the,
the negative externalities aren't 

1737
01:11:43,581 --> 01:11:44,414
projected on the rest of this because I 
certainly don't think I should be 

1738
01:11:46,290 --> 01:11:47,910
funding abortions.
Right.

1739
01:11:47,911 --> 01:11:48,700
I think that,
that,

1740
01:11:48,700 --> 01:11:49,533
that if I think it's a crime,
then I certainly should not be taxed to 

1741
01:11:52,111 --> 01:11:52,944
do that.
It's just such a place where there's so 

1742
01:11:54,661 --> 01:11:59,250
much richness for conversation where we 
can find people that are perfectly moral

1743
01:11:59,550 --> 01:12:00,383
and just view things a little bit 
differently because I do get the Tommy 

1744
01:12:03,840 --> 01:12:06,350
argument there of keeping the government
out of it and I,

1745
01:12:06,351 --> 01:12:07,184
I personally am pro choice but um,
but I find great pleasure in it at all 

1746
01:12:11,251 --> 01:12:12,880
and I have all sorts of issues with,
you know,

1747
01:12:12,900 --> 01:12:15,300
later term abortions and stuff like 
that.

1748
01:12:15,680 --> 01:12:17,010
Um,
but this,

1749
01:12:17,011 --> 01:12:19,080
this is one of those ones that it's 
just.

1750
01:12:19,450 --> 01:12:20,283
Yeah,
but we make a mistake if we looked at 

1751
01:12:21,091 --> 01:12:21,924
Tommy for intellectual stimulation,
that is an a and I hope she'll be here 

1752
01:12:25,621 --> 01:12:28,360
so that I can ask her about that.
Um,

1753
01:12:28,550 --> 01:12:29,970
all right,
last question.

1754
01:12:30,030 --> 01:12:32,170
And I already told you what it was.
So a 20,

1755
01:12:32,210 --> 01:12:33,060
20.
We're doing this.

1756
01:12:33,330 --> 01:12:34,210
No.
Um,

1757
01:12:34,600 --> 01:12:37,140
I,
I don't like running for office.

1758
01:12:37,141 --> 01:12:38,120
Um,
I,

1759
01:12:38,230 --> 01:12:40,210
I really despise it.
And um,

1760
01:12:40,320 --> 01:12:42,510
as libertarian I really liked my 
personal life.

1761
01:12:42,960 --> 01:12:47,370
Now I have looked at,
people have said Austin go run for lower

1762
01:12:47,371 --> 01:12:48,204
office.
And so I have looked at potentially 

1763
01:12:49,741 --> 01:12:50,574
running in Missouri for Senate seat.
I've still got about a two or three 

1764
01:12:54,691 --> 01:12:56,970
months before I have to decide some of 
something like that,

1765
01:12:57,240 --> 01:12:58,160
but maybe,
you know,

1766
01:12:58,590 --> 01:12:59,423
I ran for president because of the 
timing and because I thought that there 

1767
01:13:01,681 --> 01:13:04,380
just weren't that many good people who 
represented my beliefs.

1768
01:13:04,680 --> 01:13:05,513
And so I did.
I didn't run last year just because I 

1769
01:13:06,691 --> 01:13:08,820
wanted to be the king of the United 
States.

1770
01:13:08,821 --> 01:13:13,821
I ran because I thought that that Donald
and Hillary were so distasteful and Gary

1771
01:13:13,861 --> 01:13:14,694
was not the strongest candidate that 
maybe I would look good by default and 

1772
01:13:17,580 --> 01:13:19,440
you know,
could get our ideas out there.

1773
01:13:19,441 --> 01:13:20,610
And so,
and so,

1774
01:13:20,611 --> 01:13:21,444
um,
I think I,

1775
01:13:21,540 --> 01:13:22,171
in some ways,
you know,

1776
01:13:22,171 --> 01:13:25,650
I didn't win the presidency,
but in many ways I won the argument in a

1777
01:13:25,651 --> 01:13:26,484
lot of ways.
Look at retrospectively because a lot 

1778
01:13:28,081 --> 01:13:30,270
more people are now interested in 
libertarian ideas,

1779
01:13:30,271 --> 01:13:31,860
which is one of my goals.
Um,

1780
01:13:32,220 --> 01:13:33,990
but when it comes to running for 
president in 20,

1781
01:13:33,991 --> 01:13:34,824
20,
I'm going to respectfully decline at 

1782
01:13:36,121 --> 01:13:40,200
this time and say that maybe it would be
better for me to try and do something at

1783
01:13:40,201 --> 01:13:43,200
this point.
That would not be an altruist perhaps,

1784
01:13:43,201 --> 01:13:44,610
but,
but try and do something,

1785
01:13:44,611 --> 01:13:45,444
give something back to the citizens of 
my state who have got a horrible 

1786
01:13:47,911 --> 01:13:49,680
senator,
Claire mccaskill,

1787
01:13:50,010 --> 01:13:50,843
Democrat,
who's now for complete partisan 

1788
01:13:52,741 --> 01:13:53,574
politics.

1789
01:13:53,630 --> 01:13:54,463
She should kind of shooting yourself in 
the foot saying she's going to 

1790
01:13:55,591 --> 01:13:56,424
Filibuster Neil gorsuch and uh,
and she's doing this because she's 

1791
01:13:59,461 --> 01:14:01,530
terrified of the progressives in our own
party.

1792
01:14:01,830 --> 01:14:03,180
Uh,
the Bernie Bros and all that,

1793
01:14:03,181 --> 01:14:04,014
or they're threatened threatening to 
primary or so now she's being pushed so 

1794
01:14:06,811 --> 01:14:07,950
hard to the left.
She's going,

1795
01:14:07,980 --> 01:14:09,330
you know,
doing what Hillary did,

1796
01:14:09,331 --> 01:14:12,430
the mistakes and Hillary made going hard
left as you can,

1797
01:14:12,431 --> 01:14:17,200
hoping that those socialists and Social 
Democrats are going to push her into it.

1798
01:14:17,590 --> 01:14:18,423
But if I think that there is an opening 
there to maybe run for Senate in 

1799
01:14:20,831 --> 01:14:22,930
Missouri Than,
than I might pursue that.

1800
01:14:22,931 --> 01:14:24,370
But,
but God,

1801
01:14:24,371 --> 01:14:25,204
I don't know.
I see what's happening to trump on a 

1802
01:14:26,651 --> 01:14:27,670
daily basis.
And I,

1803
01:14:27,671 --> 01:14:28,504
you know,
I don't really have that much of a lust 

1804
01:14:29,771 --> 01:14:30,910
for power.
So yeah,

1805
01:14:30,911 --> 01:14:33,220
at this point,
and we see the inherent problem with all

1806
01:14:33,221 --> 01:14:33,700
of this.

1807
01:14:33,700 --> 01:14:37,720
Good principled people simply don't want
to be part of this game anymore.

1808
01:14:37,721 --> 01:14:40,570
So you're left with it.
Well,

1809
01:14:40,630 --> 01:14:41,710
you know,
it destroys you,

1810
01:14:41,740 --> 01:14:42,730
right?
So it's,

1811
01:14:42,940 --> 01:14:43,773
you know,
every little personal thing that you've 

1812
01:14:44,471 --> 01:14:45,340
ever said,
right?

1813
01:14:45,341 --> 01:14:46,174
Every job,
every off color joke that you've ever 

1814
01:14:47,351 --> 01:14:49,510
made,
say suddenly used to demonize you.

1815
01:14:49,511 --> 01:14:50,344
I mean,
I thought it was a good person until 

1816
01:14:51,130 --> 01:14:54,820
last night.
I didn't realize that as a sexist,

1817
01:14:54,821 --> 01:14:57,340
misogynist,
and all of these things.

1818
01:14:57,580 --> 01:14:59,830
And uh,
but then when you look at it,

1819
01:14:59,831 --> 01:15:01,930
it's like the truth is who is fit to 
rule?

1820
01:15:02,530 --> 01:15:04,420
Nobody's really fit to rule over all of 
us and the,

1821
01:15:04,421 --> 01:15:05,950
and the power.
It has so much power.

1822
01:15:06,550 --> 01:15:07,930
I mean,
I just,

1823
01:15:07,931 --> 01:15:09,510
um,
at this point I'm going to save me.

1824
01:15:09,511 --> 01:15:11,380
I don't really have an interest in.
All right,

1825
01:15:11,381 --> 01:15:12,340
well,
you put it on the record.

1826
01:15:12,341 --> 01:15:14,290
So now if you do end up running for 
whatever reason,

1827
01:15:14,291 --> 01:15:15,750
you're going to be considered a flip 
flop.

1828
01:15:16,090 --> 01:15:19,900
But they always do that to everybody.
Like Donald Trump said,

1829
01:15:19,901 --> 01:15:21,010
no,
I'm not going to run for president.

1830
01:15:21,011 --> 01:15:22,150
And he runs for president,
right?

1831
01:15:22,151 --> 01:15:24,280
It always does.
But you know,

1832
01:15:24,520 --> 01:15:26,770
on the,
on the minuscule chance that you know,

1833
01:15:26,771 --> 01:15:29,620
that I feel like I can see I'm called to
public service,

1834
01:15:29,621 --> 01:15:32,740
which is what it should be.
Then maybe there's an opportunity,

1835
01:15:32,770 --> 01:15:34,480
but at this point,
you know,

1836
01:15:34,481 --> 01:15:35,314
I've got a lot of other things that I 
really need to focus on my own personal 

1837
01:15:37,301 --> 01:15:37,920
life,
you know,

1838
01:15:37,920 --> 01:15:40,440
like maybe have kids someday,
you know.

1839
01:15:40,550 --> 01:15:42,280
Alright.
Well as I told you before we started,

1840
01:15:42,281 --> 01:15:44,290
people email me every day asking if I'm 
going to do it.

1841
01:15:44,350 --> 01:15:46,150
I don't want to run for president,
but if I do,

1842
01:15:46,151 --> 01:15:48,460
would you at least help me before the 
debates because you know your shit.

1843
01:15:49,660 --> 01:15:52,820
Yeah.
What is Aleppo Limbo is.

1844
01:15:53,290 --> 01:15:56,080
That's like half of it.
Would you make them bake the cake?

1845
01:15:56,230 --> 01:15:58,010
No,
I would not make them bake the cakes.

1846
01:15:58,011 --> 01:15:59,200
He thought that we haven't gotten to 
this.

1847
01:15:59,201 --> 01:16:00,460
We said okay,
let's go real quick.

1848
01:16:00,510 --> 01:16:01,343
Alright.
We'll let you know.

1849
01:16:01,350 --> 01:16:02,183
We're gonna do this for our bonus 
segment after we'll do the cake thing 

1850
01:16:04,271 --> 01:16:06,150
because people know my feelings about 
the case.

1851
01:16:06,570 --> 01:16:07,240
Alright,
I will.

1852
01:16:07,240 --> 01:16:08,073
I've thoroughly enjoyed this and for 
more on often follow them on
