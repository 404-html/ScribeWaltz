1
00:00:05,090 --> 00:00:05,923
We're continuing our partnership with 
learn liberty today and joining me is 

2
00:00:08,391 --> 00:00:12,560
the former president of the Acl,
you a board member for fire,

3
00:00:12,561 --> 00:00:13,394
epic and the Heterodox Academy,
a professor at New York law school and 

4
00:00:17,571 --> 00:00:22,571
author of the new book hate why we 
should resist it with free speech,

5
00:00:22,671 --> 00:00:23,504
not censorship,
Nadian Strauss and welcome to the Rubin 

6
00:00:25,611 --> 00:00:26,900
report to be here,
Dave.

7
00:00:27,110 --> 00:00:27,943
So I have to tell you when I was reading
through your bio and looking at all the 

8
00:00:31,341 --> 00:00:34,160
boards you've sat on and head of Acl,
you and all that,

9
00:00:34,161 --> 00:00:34,994
I don't know that anyone has ever been 
more of sort of a perfect prime guests 

10
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:39,433
to sit in that chair and my prayer book 
defending pornography that caught your 

11
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:46,400
attention.
We can get into that too,

12
00:00:46,430 --> 00:00:47,263
but really your,
your life's work is sort of exactly why 

13
00:00:50,241 --> 00:00:55,241
I do this show and I know I'm setting 
you up now with a very high bar here,

14
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:55,870
but.

15
00:00:55,870 --> 00:00:58,970
But this is what it's all about.
Thank you so much and thank you for your

16
00:00:58,971 --> 00:01:03,350
ardent defense of liberty.
That is the most important value for me.

17
00:01:03,380 --> 00:01:06,650
And when people ask me what my politics 
are,

18
00:01:06,651 --> 00:01:07,484
I usually say I care more about my civil
libertarian beliefs than I care about 

19
00:01:12,471 --> 00:01:13,304
partisan political beliefs,
and one of the things that's true for 

20
00:01:15,711 --> 00:01:20,711
the Acu as well as for me as an 
individual is not taking per say,

21
00:01:21,561 --> 00:01:24,440
across the board positions on any 
candidate,

22
00:01:24,620 --> 00:01:25,453
official party or group,
but judging on an issue by issue basis 

23
00:01:29,691 --> 00:01:30,524
and issuing a criticism or a or praise 
on an issue by issue basis and there's 

24
00:01:36,501 --> 00:01:37,334
not a single party or candidate or 
official that hasn't earned some praise 

25
00:01:40,911 --> 00:01:44,330
and some criticism on some important 
civil liberties issues.

26
00:01:44,331 --> 00:01:47,390
So looking at the glass half full as an 
activist,

27
00:01:47,391 --> 00:01:48,224
I always do that.
There's nobody with whom I don't share 

28
00:01:51,021 --> 00:01:54,560
some really strong convictions,
which is very nice.

29
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:55,393
Now it's also true that there's nobody 
with whom I have some strong 

30
00:01:58,311 --> 00:01:59,144
disagreements,
but I'm used to therefore having a 

31
00:02:02,301 --> 00:02:03,134
positive relationship across ideological
divides and the absence of that or the 

32
00:02:08,901 --> 00:02:12,320
fading of that in today's climate is 
very bothersome.

33
00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:13,493
All right.
What a great place to start this 

34
00:02:14,751 --> 00:02:17,990
conversation then.
So as you've seen that fail,

35
00:02:18,050 --> 00:02:18,883
that fade in society,
do you have a couple of markers or 

36
00:02:22,041 --> 00:02:27,041
moments where you started to really see 
it or has it just been a slow slide into

37
00:02:27,711 --> 00:02:29,300
wherever it seems that we're at at the 
moment?

38
00:02:29,330 --> 00:02:31,430
That's a really good question,
Dave,

39
00:02:31,431 --> 00:02:35,480
and I'm sure some sociologists have 
probably analyze it more.

40
00:02:35,481 --> 00:02:39,350
Exactly.
My impression is,

41
00:02:39,351 --> 00:02:43,070
at least on issues,
let's stay with issues of free speech.

42
00:02:43,340 --> 00:02:44,173
Uh,
my strong impression is that there 

43
00:02:46,071 --> 00:02:51,071
started to be a real breaking point in 
around 2015.

44
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,300
Uh,
I think that's when we had the ferguson.

45
00:02:56,340 --> 00:02:57,173
I'm a riots and uh,
demonstrations and protests around the 

46
00:03:02,141 --> 00:03:07,141
country and I am completely sympathetic 
to that cause believe me,

47
00:03:08,030 --> 00:03:08,863
abuses in the criminal justice system.
I have been on my radar screen and the 

48
00:03:12,461 --> 00:03:13,294
acl for ever a way back in the dark ages
or some would say the ages of the I 

49
00:03:19,540 --> 00:03:24,180
meant only in the sense of old wasn't a 
stigmatizing referenced,

50
00:03:24,181 --> 00:03:28,390
but the Reagan administration.
I used to debate his attorney,

51
00:03:28,391 --> 00:03:29,224
General Ed meese on proposition such as 
is the criminal justice system racially 

52
00:03:35,441 --> 00:03:37,660
discriminatory.
So the,

53
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:39,610
and I was taking the yes,
possession,

54
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:44,760
so the fact that we have this outpouring
and support of social justice and Racial

55
00:03:45,161 --> 00:03:45,994
Justice and uh,
immigrants rights and antisexual 

56
00:03:49,091 --> 00:03:50,860
violence,
all of that is wonderful.

57
00:03:50,861 --> 00:03:51,694
But starting several years ago,
it started to seem more and more that 

58
00:03:57,100 --> 00:03:57,933
advocates of these causes began to see 
free speech as their enemy rather than 

59
00:04:04,751 --> 00:04:05,584
what I know it to be,
which is they're time tested essential 

60
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:10,473
ally.

61
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:11,433
Uh,
so there was this pitting of liberty 

62
00:04:13,421 --> 00:04:18,421
against equality of civil rights,
against civil liberties.

63
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:19,593
And as I say that,
I realized that it was the second time 

64
00:04:22,721 --> 00:04:25,750
that had happened in my adult lifetime.
The first time that,

65
00:04:26,460 --> 00:04:29,860
that happened very strongly was in the 
late 19 eighties,

66
00:04:29,890 --> 00:04:30,723
early 19 nineties,
which was the first time that hate 

67
00:04:33,971 --> 00:04:37,210
speech codes were proposed on college 
campus.

68
00:04:37,211 --> 00:04:38,044
It's the first time we started seeing 
criticism of what was called political 

69
00:04:42,610 --> 00:04:44,500
correctness.
And then to,

70
00:04:44,740 --> 00:04:49,740
especially law professors were arguing 
very strongly that you have to choose.

71
00:04:49,990 --> 00:04:52,930
You can't have both liberty and 
equality.

72
00:04:52,931 --> 00:04:56,740
And that's anathema to my own beliefs 
and experience.

73
00:04:56,900 --> 00:04:59,080
And that's kind of where we're at right 
now.

74
00:04:59,081 --> 00:05:01,690
That seems to be where this argument has
boiled down to.

75
00:05:01,691 --> 00:05:05,230
So before we unpack all of that stuff,
how did you get involved in this?

76
00:05:05,231 --> 00:05:06,064
What was it about your education or your
upbringing or whatever else that made 

77
00:05:10,031 --> 00:05:13,060
you care about free speech,
civil liberties,

78
00:05:13,061 --> 00:05:13,894
everything else that you've just 
mentioned it as far back as I can 

79
00:05:15,761 --> 00:05:16,570
remember.

80
00:05:16,570 --> 00:05:17,403
I have been in favor of individual 
liberty and resisting anybody who tried 

81
00:05:22,241 --> 00:05:26,020
to encroach on my liberty or that of 
anybody else's.

82
00:05:26,021 --> 00:05:30,520
So long before I had the terminology,
I resisted my parents,

83
00:05:30,521 --> 00:05:34,150
authoritarianism,
my school teacher authoritarianism.

84
00:05:34,510 --> 00:05:36,580
Uh,
I was kind of a contrarian.

85
00:05:36,581 --> 00:05:38,980
I would always like to see a different 
perspective.

86
00:05:38,981 --> 00:05:42,910
And I remember being very puzzled as a 
fairly young student.

87
00:05:42,911 --> 00:05:46,750
Maybe I was about 10 or 11 years old and
a teacher said to me,

88
00:05:46,780 --> 00:05:47,613
own a dean,
why do you always have to defend the 

89
00:05:50,231 --> 00:05:53,590
underdog?
And she said it as a criticism and to me

90
00:05:53,591 --> 00:05:54,130
it was,
well,

91
00:05:54,130 --> 00:05:54,963
they're the ones that need the defense.
I have also always valued freedom of 

92
00:06:00,321 --> 00:06:05,321
speech for ideas that I disagree with.
So I remember I was in college,

93
00:06:06,770 --> 00:06:10,010
uh,
from 1968 to 1972,

94
00:06:10,310 --> 00:06:11,143
a very involved in the movement against 
the Vietnam War Movement for 

95
00:06:17,031 --> 00:06:18,440
reproductive freedom.

96
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:21,770
That was before the Supreme Court 
decided Roe v Dot Wade again,

97
00:06:21,771 --> 00:06:23,810
that really dark ages,
um,

98
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:28,840
but I also always defended freedom for 
people who disagreed with me,

99
00:06:29,181 --> 00:06:30,014
so I would have lot big arguments with 
members of SDS students for Democratic 

100
00:06:37,190 --> 00:06:39,080
Society,
very radical organization that wanted to

101
00:06:39,081 --> 00:06:39,914
shout down certain speakers that were in
favor of the Vietnam war administration 

102
00:06:44,841 --> 00:06:48,320
officials and so forth.
And while I disagreed with the points of

103
00:06:48,321 --> 00:06:51,710
view of those speakers,
I didn't believe it that they should,

104
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:55,760
that we should be denying them a podium.
So as far back as I remember,

105
00:06:55,761 --> 00:06:56,594
I've been a,
I cared much more about freedom in part 

106
00:07:01,221 --> 00:07:06,221
because I do see that as the essential 
means to advance whatever other cause is

107
00:07:08,421 --> 00:07:09,254
dear to you.
It's hard to defend the people that you 

108
00:07:11,361 --> 00:07:12,240
don't like,
isn't it?

109
00:07:12,241 --> 00:07:14,690
It seems to me that that's the one we're
forgetting these days.

110
00:07:14,691 --> 00:07:17,540
Like everyone screams about free speech 
all the time.

111
00:07:17,990 --> 00:07:22,490
The second someone says they don't like,
then they kind of get quiet real quick.

112
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:23,353
Well,
so I was shortly after I graduated from 

113
00:07:25,971 --> 00:07:27,220
law school,
uh,

114
00:07:27,230 --> 00:07:31,610
the Acu and I was not involved at the 
national level at all at that point,

115
00:07:31,611 --> 00:07:32,444
but the acl,
you got involved in the infamous or 

116
00:07:35,061 --> 00:07:39,590
famous skokie case and that was like a 
real litmus test.

117
00:07:39,591 --> 00:07:44,591
I assume most viewers know what that is,
but for those who might not in 1977,

118
00:07:45,711 --> 00:07:46,544
the acu came to the defense of the free 
speech rights of a group of neo Nazis 

119
00:07:52,820 --> 00:07:53,653
who wanted to demonstrate in Skokie,
Illinois a suburb of Chicago that had a 

120
00:07:58,881 --> 00:07:59,714
large Jewish population and a large 
population of Holocaust survivors and 

121
00:08:05,570 --> 00:08:09,830
many members of the acl,
you even this stalwart,

122
00:08:09,831 --> 00:08:10,664
free speech organization a loss.
We lost about 15 percent of our members 

123
00:08:15,591 --> 00:08:18,080
who said,
we really defend free speech,

124
00:08:18,170 --> 00:08:19,003
but this is the one exception we want to
make for this absolutely abhorrent 

125
00:08:22,971 --> 00:08:23,690
speech.

126
00:08:23,690 --> 00:08:28,690
Now my father is a holocaust survivor.
I have to say was sadly he died,

127
00:08:29,541 --> 00:08:34,541
but it wasn't even an issue for me.
I have to tell you,

128
00:08:35,061 --> 00:08:35,894
dave,
and it's coming back to your question 

129
00:08:37,221 --> 00:08:38,054
because you said something about how 
does it feel to defend people that you 

130
00:08:42,831 --> 00:08:46,940
disagree with and to me,
I never defending them.

131
00:08:47,270 --> 00:08:51,410
I'm never defending their ideas.
I'm never defending.

132
00:08:51,411 --> 00:08:52,244
What did they say?
I am defending the principle that 

133
00:08:55,891 --> 00:09:00,891
government should not have power to 
silence speech just because the majority

134
00:09:03,001 --> 00:09:03,834
of the public,
even the vast majority of the public 

135
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:07,253
low.
This despises the idea that the speech 

136
00:09:09,741 --> 00:09:10,980
is conveying.
Yeah,

137
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:11,873
so that's incredible.
Obviously I know the skokie case well 

138
00:09:13,611 --> 00:09:14,444
and I'm sure many much of my audiences,
I didn't realize 15 percent did you say 

139
00:09:17,371 --> 00:09:20,610
50 percent of the membership of a clu 
members.

140
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:23,610
That's a massive amount of so and and 
you know it.

141
00:09:23,620 --> 00:09:27,510
So the ACO,
you really put its money where its mouth

142
00:09:27,511 --> 00:09:30,510
is.
It was a tremendous financial hit,

143
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:34,350
a and there was a lot of negative press.
Now,

144
00:09:34,410 --> 00:09:38,100
in fairness,
a fairly soon after that,

145
00:09:38,101 --> 00:09:41,700
the ACL,
you began to recoup members,

146
00:09:41,701 --> 00:09:43,920
maybe not necessarily the same people.
In fact,

147
00:09:43,921 --> 00:09:44,754
other people who wrote in and said,
we see that you really aren't neutrally 

148
00:09:48,781 --> 00:09:49,614
defending civil liberties even for 
people that are anti civil or raised 

149
00:09:53,281 --> 00:09:54,120
themselves.
Now.

150
00:09:54,330 --> 00:09:55,980
That's sad.
I have to tell you,

151
00:09:56,220 --> 00:09:58,980
almost every time I give a speech 
anywhere,

152
00:09:59,190 --> 00:10:03,120
people will come up to me and say,
I was an acl EU member,

153
00:10:03,121 --> 00:10:06,740
but I quit over skokie and a Ra,
nih,

154
00:10:06,741 --> 00:10:08,970
or who was the executive director at the
time.

155
00:10:08,971 --> 00:10:13,260
And interestingly enough himself,
a Holocaust survivor.

156
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:14,273
He was born in Berlin.
His extended family was completely 

157
00:10:17,731 --> 00:10:22,380
exterminated by the Nazis.
He and his immediate family escaped and,

158
00:10:22,740 --> 00:10:23,573
uh,
and he wrote a wonderful book about it 

159
00:10:24,751 --> 00:10:28,290
afterwards called defending my enemy,
which I quote in my book,

160
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:29,513
uh,
and we can talk about how that might 

161
00:10:31,501 --> 00:10:34,080
seem paradoxical,
but it's really not.

162
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:35,490
But anyway,
in this context,

163
00:10:35,491 --> 00:10:38,220
I brought him up because he said to me,
Nadine,

164
00:10:38,221 --> 00:10:41,650
if every person who said they left the 
acl,

165
00:10:41,651 --> 00:10:44,360
you over skokie really had been a 
member.

166
00:10:44,370 --> 00:10:45,203
We would have been the largest 
organization in the world ever talking 

167
00:10:48,451 --> 00:10:52,440
to a game.
But you will see if I can just follow up

168
00:10:52,441 --> 00:10:53,274
on that.
It's not just an abstract principle 

169
00:10:55,081 --> 00:11:00,081
because you can really see how the 
principal has concrete ramifications for

170
00:11:00,361 --> 00:11:05,040
exactly the opposite idea,
so in our briefs and the skokie case,

171
00:11:05,041 --> 00:11:05,874
we pointed out that the arguments that 
were being made to justify suppressing 

172
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:11,753
the Nazis,
namely that their ideas were offensive 

173
00:11:14,850 --> 00:11:15,683
and insulting and threatening and seen 
as dangerous to the Jews and the 

174
00:11:20,041 --> 00:11:20,874
Holocaust survivors in skokie.
That was exactly the same set of 

175
00:11:24,301 --> 00:11:25,134
arguments that was made not that much 
earlier in 1968 when Martin Luther King 

176
00:11:30,450 --> 00:11:34,170
was trying to demonstrate in Cicero,
Illinois,

177
00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:35,093
the very same state,
but with a very different population 

178
00:11:37,441 --> 00:11:41,280
that saw his ideas as threatening and 
dangerous and subversive,

179
00:11:41,281 --> 00:11:42,114
offensive and insulting,
and this is where this weird subjective 

180
00:11:44,671 --> 00:11:45,504
nature of this comes in,
which is why you've said several times 

181
00:11:47,341 --> 00:11:49,680
now you're defending the principal,
not the person,

182
00:11:49,850 --> 00:11:53,140
and that that of course is the is the 
key to this whole thing,

183
00:11:53,141 --> 00:11:54,100
but we've been pushed

184
00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:58,390
into this place these days where it 
seems like there's a large set of people

185
00:11:58,391 --> 00:12:03,391
or certainly a set of very loud people 
who think that speech is violent.

186
00:12:05,140 --> 00:12:05,973
It ain't violence well.
I suppose speech could advocate 

187
00:12:09,281 --> 00:12:11,800
violence,
it could incite violence,

188
00:12:11,801 --> 00:12:13,300
it could threaten violence.

189
00:12:13,310 --> 00:12:14,143
So do you.
So do you agree with where we have the 

190
00:12:15,501 --> 00:12:18,440
law is now in terms of you can't 
directly insight and that sort of thing.

191
00:12:18,441 --> 00:12:20,920
Do you think all those laws are are just
inappropriate?

192
00:12:21,050 --> 00:12:21,883
Absolutely,
and I have to say even though I've been 

193
00:12:23,061 --> 00:12:26,540
teaching constitutional law,
the First Amendment for decades,

194
00:12:26,541 --> 00:12:27,374
the process of writing this book and 
thinking about it and even more focused 

195
00:12:30,921 --> 00:12:31,754
fashion really increased my respect for 
us law and I really think that for many 

196
00:12:38,211 --> 00:12:39,044
people,
if they would just understand what the 

197
00:12:41,781 --> 00:12:42,614
law actually provides,
they would be much more supportive of 

198
00:12:46,641 --> 00:12:47,474
freedom of speech because it is much 
more nuanced and much more common 

199
00:12:50,961 --> 00:12:55,961
sensical than is often misdescribe when 
people say either,

200
00:12:56,030 --> 00:12:58,400
Oh,
hate speech is not free speech.

201
00:12:58,700 --> 00:12:59,533
We heard here that a lot,
including when you were at the 

202
00:13:02,330 --> 00:13:03,170
University of New Hampshire,
we are that a lot.

203
00:13:03,171 --> 00:13:05,690
Right?
And then conversely,

204
00:13:05,691 --> 00:13:06,710
people will say,
Oh,

205
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:11,570
hate speech is protected and neither 
generalization is correct.

206
00:13:11,870 --> 00:13:13,060
Yes,
I.

207
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:14,113
The fact that speech has a hateful or 
hated message idea or content can never 

208
00:13:22,071 --> 00:13:24,710
be adjusted if occasion for censoring 
it,

209
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:25,753
but if in a particular context,
a hateful message along with any other 

210
00:13:31,431 --> 00:13:32,264
message directly causes certain serious,
specific imminent harm and there's no 

211
00:13:39,921 --> 00:13:43,250
way to avert that harm other than 
punishing the speech,

212
00:13:43,430 --> 00:13:44,263
then the speech can and should be 
punished and common examples that 

213
00:13:48,021 --> 00:13:53,021
satisfy that standard are intentional 
incitement of imminent violence,

214
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:57,800
a genuine threat that instills fear that
you're going to be subject to violence.

215
00:13:58,040 --> 00:13:58,930
Um,
uh,

216
00:13:59,010 --> 00:14:03,380
another example is a hate crime and that
is,

217
00:14:03,460 --> 00:14:04,040
it's,
it's,

218
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:07,310
it's a little bit different in the sense
that a,

219
00:14:07,311 --> 00:14:11,700
and I'm going so much into my,
we're going into the weeds,

220
00:14:12,020 --> 00:14:13,040
but that's good.
That's good.

221
00:14:13,041 --> 00:14:13,874
Okay.
So if I can say there is no term hate 

222
00:14:16,940 --> 00:14:17,773
speech and that was the point that you 
made in your University of New 

223
00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:23,470
Hampshire.
Not have said that it's a fact.

224
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:27,140
Right.
And it's a fact that is subscribed to by

225
00:14:27,350 --> 00:14:31,970
every single supreme court justice 
across the ideological spectrum.

226
00:14:31,971 --> 00:14:32,804
You know,
from Ginsburg and Sotomayor on the left 

227
00:14:34,581 --> 00:14:37,760
to Alito and gorsuch and Scalia.
On the right,

228
00:14:37,761 --> 00:14:38,594
and I think that's a very,
very important point that for all of 

229
00:14:41,331 --> 00:14:46,331
their ideological differences on so many
issues that so many justices,

230
00:14:47,421 --> 00:14:48,254
every justice in modern history has 
subscribed to this principal and I wish 

231
00:14:52,971 --> 00:14:57,971
that people across the ideological 
spectrum in other branches of government

232
00:14:58,221 --> 00:15:02,660
and the general public which share that 
unanimity because no matter who you are,

233
00:15:02,661 --> 00:15:03,494
no matter what you believe,
you really have a stake in denying the 

234
00:15:06,801 --> 00:15:11,801
government and the majority of of people
that wield power taken away from you.

235
00:15:12,980 --> 00:15:17,240
The choice about which views you will 
express or listened to or refute.

236
00:15:17,330 --> 00:15:21,800
So in that University of New Hampshire 
speech that I know you watched when,

237
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:23,360
when I was saying there,
you know,

238
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:26,000
hate speech is not real.
Obviously.

239
00:15:26,001 --> 00:15:28,940
I was making the distinction between the
direct call to violence,

240
00:15:28,941 --> 00:15:31,130
which I actually said unless it's a 
direct call to bounce,

241
00:15:31,131 --> 00:15:34,250
but hate speech in and of itself is,
is nothing.

242
00:15:34,251 --> 00:15:35,084
It's not a,
it's not a thing you can say mean 

243
00:15:36,981 --> 00:15:38,660
things.
I would prefer you don't.

244
00:15:39,350 --> 00:15:42,500
We wish we could all be nice to each 
other and say lovely things.

245
00:15:42,501 --> 00:15:43,334
They use pronouns.
At the way people want it and all of 

246
00:15:44,951 --> 00:15:45,784
those things,
but you can't have the government doing 

247
00:15:46,791 --> 00:15:47,624
it.
Is there anything else that I should 

248
00:15:49,001 --> 00:15:49,834
have added that,
that perhaps could have gotten those 

249
00:15:52,821 --> 00:15:54,670
young people to,
uh,

250
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:58,040
listen,
that they were disposed not to listen,

251
00:15:58,041 --> 00:15:58,874
but for,
there were obviously some openminded 

252
00:16:00,260 --> 00:16:01,220
people in the audience.

253
00:16:01,220 --> 00:16:02,630
And those are the ones that you're,
I mean,

254
00:16:02,631 --> 00:16:03,880
the hecklers,
I think we're,

255
00:16:04,100 --> 00:16:04,933
we're not,
they didn't seem genuinely interested 

256
00:16:06,981 --> 00:16:08,180
in,
in hearing you out,

257
00:16:08,181 --> 00:16:11,630
but many other people there did.
And the other point that,

258
00:16:11,860 --> 00:16:15,050
that I would make strategically,
Dave and I already did it,

259
00:16:15,051 --> 00:16:19,750
and pointing out the Martin Luther King 
counterpart to the Nazis is I always try

260
00:16:19,751 --> 00:16:24,751
to give an example.
We're an idea that you happen to support

261
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:25,953
the person I'm talking to.
It really supports would be threatened 

262
00:16:28,550 --> 00:16:31,040
if we gave that power to the government.
So,

263
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:32,153
uh,
for that,

264
00:16:32,370 --> 00:16:35,570
that audience where you had people 
chanting black lives matter,

265
00:16:35,810 --> 00:16:36,643
I would have pointed out how many 
government officials now are saying 

266
00:16:40,821 --> 00:16:45,821
black lives matter advocacy should be 
treated as hate speech.

267
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:52,080
That even saying that black lives matter
should be treated as a hate group,

268
00:16:52,790 --> 00:16:53,623
uh,
the southern poverty law center which 

269
00:16:54,951 --> 00:16:59,951
monitors hate groups has been lobbied to
treat black lives matter as such.

270
00:17:00,350 --> 00:17:01,183
And so then you had to say to people,
you have to understand that it's not 

271
00:17:04,791 --> 00:17:05,624
your values that are going to be 
implemented by the enforcing officials 

272
00:17:09,471 --> 00:17:12,620
across the country.
And if we have this loose,

273
00:17:12,621 --> 00:17:13,454
nebulous concept,
I mean hate is an emotion that's 

274
00:17:16,611 --> 00:17:20,570
inherently subjective.
What one person considers hateful,

275
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:21,553
somebody else cherishes.
So you mentioned the southern poverty 

276
00:17:24,831 --> 00:17:27,230
law center.
I don't want to get you in any hot water

277
00:17:27,231 --> 00:17:28,970
a,
but they to me,

278
00:17:28,971 --> 00:17:31,880
strike me as an organization that has 
completely,

279
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:36,320
completely with almost no reservation.
Can I say this,

280
00:17:36,590 --> 00:17:38,510
gone off the rails,
but are they have,

281
00:17:38,540 --> 00:17:39,980
you know,
between now they just,

282
00:17:40,190 --> 00:17:41,460
just in this last week,
they,

283
00:17:41,461 --> 00:17:42,294
they lost this lawsuit.
Marginalized is getting a three point 

284
00:17:44,181 --> 00:17:45,590
$3,000,000
settlement.

285
00:17:45,591 --> 00:17:48,590
But they had Ayaan Hirsi Ali and 
Bridgette Gabriel.

286
00:17:48,591 --> 00:17:50,010
And several other people who I've had

287
00:17:50,010 --> 00:17:52,620
on the show who I think are,
are wonderful people,

288
00:17:52,810 --> 00:17:54,040
uh,
on their hate lists.

289
00:17:54,041 --> 00:17:54,874
They just put up an article about the 
evils of prager university and and 

290
00:17:58,710 --> 00:17:59,543
called me out by name.
What am I to make of the shifting of 

291
00:18:03,330 --> 00:18:04,163
traditionally organizations that were 
doing good work into becoming what I 

292
00:18:07,801 --> 00:18:08,634
would say are really far left advocacy 
groups instead of maybe the original 

293
00:18:12,481 --> 00:18:13,720
mission statement.
Would you.

294
00:18:13,890 --> 00:18:14,723
I think that was a fair assessment.
Just not knowledgeable enough about the 

295
00:18:17,251 --> 00:18:18,084
instances that you site.
So I'll go back to something I said at 

296
00:18:20,491 --> 00:18:21,324
the beginning,
which is I don't endorse or criticize 

297
00:18:24,300 --> 00:18:25,133
any organization across the board.
I look at it issue by issue and I think 

298
00:18:29,810 --> 00:18:34,810
the southern poverty law center has done
a lot of good work on issues that,

299
00:18:35,230 --> 00:18:39,690
that I care about,
including a freedom of speech on campus.

300
00:18:39,691 --> 00:18:43,890
And they definitely oppose censorship 
are including of hate speech.

301
00:18:43,891 --> 00:18:46,980
I testified with a leader of the SPLC,
uh,

302
00:18:46,981 --> 00:18:47,814
before a congress last year and 
completely opposed to censorship 

303
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:55,410
completely supporting counter speech.
And in fact,

304
00:18:55,411 --> 00:19:00,411
the SPLC put out a wonderful guide for 
college students at the beginning of the

305
00:19:00,570 --> 00:19:01,403
last academic year,
urging them when a white supremacists 

306
00:19:07,391 --> 00:19:12,180
recruiters are coming to campus not to 
engage in disruption,

307
00:19:12,390 --> 00:19:15,510
not try to censor them or to shout them 
down,

308
00:19:15,690 --> 00:19:18,630
but to ignore them.
And I thought that was right,

309
00:19:18,631 --> 00:19:22,830
not only in principle,
but also as a matter of strategy because

310
00:19:22,831 --> 00:19:26,160
you're just playing into their tactics.
Now,

311
00:19:26,310 --> 00:19:28,520
does that mean that every single thing 
they've done is,

312
00:19:28,521 --> 00:19:29,730
is,
is praiseworthy?

313
00:19:29,731 --> 00:19:34,180
I doubted I,
I think even the Hclu is not a above.

314
00:19:34,181 --> 00:19:34,250
Yeah,

315
00:19:34,250 --> 00:19:37,130
criticism.
So I know when,

316
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:39,950
when they sent over some notes about 
what we,

317
00:19:40,010 --> 00:19:42,710
what we potentially could talk about 
your book and everything else.

318
00:19:43,030 --> 00:19:46,310
Um,
so because you did watch that University

319
00:19:46,310 --> 00:19:47,143
of New Hampshire thing,
there's a moment where a girl that was 

320
00:19:48,741 --> 00:19:51,830
challenged me kept implying that it was 
free speech,

321
00:19:51,831 --> 00:19:54,760
sort of that led to the Holocaust,
that it was this,

322
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:56,960
that we,
they allowed incitement.

323
00:19:56,961 --> 00:19:58,640
And that that's what led to it.
Now,

324
00:19:58,641 --> 00:20:01,580
my basic argument was the more speech 
there is,

325
00:20:01,581 --> 00:20:05,360
the more we can allow sunlight to 
disinfect bad ideas.

326
00:20:05,630 --> 00:20:08,600
But I think perhaps I could have been a 
little more forceful there.

327
00:20:08,601 --> 00:20:10,940
If you were standing next to me when we 
were doing this,

328
00:20:11,150 --> 00:20:11,983
what would you have been saying in my 
ear to that argument that if we just 

329
00:20:14,571 --> 00:20:15,404
keep letting people say all these awful 
things that it can lead to awful things 

330
00:20:18,381 --> 00:20:21,220
and awful things obviously have happened
throughout the course of your years.

331
00:20:21,380 --> 00:20:22,213
I have a lot of answers,
but let me start with the one that is 

332
00:20:24,171 --> 00:20:27,500
most specific to the Holocaust.
And again,

333
00:20:27,501 --> 00:20:28,334
I have a personal stake and I know you 
also lost relatives in the Holocaust 

334
00:20:32,360 --> 00:20:32,871
offer.
Me.

335
00:20:32,871 --> 00:20:33,704
My father fortunately survived,
but he was in a concentration camp and 

336
00:20:36,471 --> 00:20:37,304
suffered grievously doing forced labor 
and in fact was scheduled to be 

337
00:20:42,530 --> 00:20:47,530
sterilized and then was liberated by the
US one day before.

338
00:20:49,541 --> 00:20:50,860
So,
you know,

339
00:20:50,861 --> 00:20:53,770
I almost had my life exterminated before
it began.

340
00:20:53,771 --> 00:20:57,040
I have no love lost for the Nazis are.
In fact,

341
00:20:57,100 --> 00:20:57,933
there was a,
there were hate speech laws in the 

342
00:21:03,190 --> 00:21:03,850
Weimar Republic during,
in,

343
00:21:03,850 --> 00:21:04,683
which is in Germany,
where Hitler rose to power and the hate 

344
00:21:08,561 --> 00:21:09,394
speech laws were very similar to the 
ones that exist in Germany and other 

345
00:21:12,731 --> 00:21:16,360
countries today.
They were very strictly enforced.

346
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:20,830
Nazis were prosecuted and convicted 
repeatedly.

347
00:21:21,070 --> 00:21:22,330
And guess what?

348
00:21:22,420 --> 00:21:27,420
They laughed at.
It was a huge propaganda opportunity for

349
00:21:27,461 --> 00:21:28,294
them.
They gained attention and support that 

350
00:21:30,701 --> 00:21:35,290
they otherwise never would have had,
just like the Neo Nazis in skokie.

351
00:21:35,291 --> 00:21:36,124
All those years later,
nobody would have heard of them if we 

352
00:21:38,650 --> 00:21:39,483
adjust,
allowed them to have their miserable 

353
00:21:41,501 --> 00:21:46,210
little march for the 20 minutes to 30 
minutes they were seeking to March.

354
00:21:46,390 --> 00:21:47,223
Instead,
it becomes two years worth of worldwide 

355
00:21:48,701 --> 00:21:49,720
attention.
Now,

356
00:21:49,721 --> 00:21:54,721
the problem in Nazi in Pre Nazi Germany 
was that there was no protection against

357
00:21:55,960 --> 00:22:00,130
violence,
that the Nazis were engaging in a.

358
00:22:00,131 --> 00:22:01,230
so,
uh,

359
00:22:01,270 --> 00:22:02,103
their political opponents as well as 
Jews and others were subject literally 

360
00:22:05,501 --> 00:22:06,334
to physical assaults and even murder 
without any sufficient protection or 

361
00:22:11,171 --> 00:22:15,430
punishment.
So the other point I would make is that,

362
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:16,473
um,
those of us who are minorities and Jews 

363
00:22:19,691 --> 00:22:23,170
are a tiny minority in this country and 
around the world,

364
00:22:23,580 --> 00:22:24,413
especially depend on freedom of speech 
because by definition we're never going 

365
00:22:29,511 --> 00:22:31,960
to have majority power.

366
00:22:32,170 --> 00:22:33,003
So all we have to depend on a to limit 
the majority from trampling on our 

367
00:22:39,041 --> 00:22:39,874
rights is freedom of speech to protest 
the First Amendment Right of 

368
00:22:44,081 --> 00:22:45,820
association,
uh,

369
00:22:45,821 --> 00:22:49,690
to the right to petition the government 
for redress of grievances.

370
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:53,430
Are Jonathan routes should great gay 
rights advocate who my quota,

371
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:58,090
my work makes the same point about Noah 
as a member of sexual orientation.

372
00:22:58,120 --> 00:23:01,540
Minority.
All minorities especially depend on free

373
00:23:01,541 --> 00:23:02,540
speech.
Uh,

374
00:23:02,550 --> 00:23:06,880
I quote all a lot of civil rights 
leaders in my book,

375
00:23:06,940 --> 00:23:09,700
Martin Luther King,
the Naacp,

376
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:10,833
uh,
throughout the civil rights movement 

377
00:23:11,891 --> 00:23:12,724
were completely opposed to censorship 
including hate speech laws in part 

378
00:23:17,171 --> 00:23:18,004
because their speech was viewed as hated
and even hateful and certainly 

379
00:23:22,811 --> 00:23:24,900
dangerous.
How concerned are you about

380
00:23:25,100 --> 00:23:28,180
self censorship?
Not not the government doing it,

381
00:23:28,181 --> 00:23:31,810
but what I see more as the sort of the 
low level war right now,

382
00:23:31,811 --> 00:23:32,644
which is just the emails that I get 
every day about people afraid to speak 

383
00:23:35,921 --> 00:23:36,754
up at work.
People are afraid to speak up at 

384
00:23:37,871 --> 00:23:38,704
college.
People literally afraid to speak up in 

385
00:23:40,361 --> 00:23:44,260
their own homes because they've been so 
crushed by political correctness.

386
00:23:44,261 --> 00:23:45,890
They don't want to start fights with 
loved ones.

387
00:23:46,100 --> 00:23:49,580
It's.
It's a serious problem and I have to say

388
00:23:49,581 --> 00:23:54,581
it's a difficult problem because to some
extent the point of counter speech,

389
00:23:56,031 --> 00:23:56,864
which I advocated by the way,
that's a legalistic way of saying 

390
00:24:00,650 --> 00:24:01,483
anything you disagree with,
you just rate rather than trying to 

391
00:24:04,161 --> 00:24:04,994
squelch it,
stopping that expression from coming 

392
00:24:07,221 --> 00:24:09,020
out.
You respond to it,

393
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:12,140
you debate it,
you try to persuade you could Joel,

394
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:15,290
so that's countering an idea you 
disliked with your own speech.

395
00:24:15,770 --> 00:24:16,603
To some extent,
the goal of counter speech is to chill 

396
00:24:20,660 --> 00:24:24,200
certain speech and certain ideas,
right?

397
00:24:24,350 --> 00:24:29,350
You want to dissuade somebody from 
adhering to white supremacist views.

398
00:24:29,721 --> 00:24:32,870
You don't see it as bad if they self 
sensor,

399
00:24:32,930 --> 00:24:33,763
right,
but when does that persuasion cross the 

400
00:24:37,671 --> 00:24:38,504
line into bullying or Harrison?
I think that's a very important and 

401
00:24:43,761 --> 00:24:44,594
difficult issue,
which was discussed very extensively in 

402
00:24:49,550 --> 00:24:53,210
the famous John Stuart Mill Essay on 
liberty,

403
00:24:53,530 --> 00:24:55,820
uh,
many people who haven't recently read it

404
00:24:55,821 --> 00:24:56,654
wouldn't be surprised as I was because I
hadn't read it for a few years and keep 

405
00:25:00,021 --> 00:25:01,490
a copy of it with me on my travels.

406
00:25:01,490 --> 00:25:06,490
And somebody reminded me that his main 
focus there was not on direct government

407
00:25:08,181 --> 00:25:09,014
coercion,
but rather on the social pressure that 

408
00:25:13,071 --> 00:25:16,070
is exerted by colleagues,
peers,

409
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:19,040
civil society,
and in this country.

410
00:25:19,041 --> 00:25:19,874
On the one hand,
I'm very glad that there is such a 

411
00:25:22,190 --> 00:25:23,023
robust civil society,
condemnation of racist tweets by 

412
00:25:28,011 --> 00:25:31,760
Roseanne Barr to cite a fairly recent 
example.

413
00:25:31,850 --> 00:25:32,683
On the other hand,
I'm afraid of the mob ruthlessly 

414
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:43,480
punishing somebody who may have just 
said something that's insensitive.

415
00:25:44,390 --> 00:25:45,570
Uh,
and,

416
00:25:45,630 --> 00:25:46,130
and,
and,

417
00:25:46,130 --> 00:25:48,110
and I'm concerned about that,
David.

418
00:25:48,111 --> 00:25:51,510
Not only because I don't want to,
um,

419
00:25:51,740 --> 00:25:52,573
you know,
the mob is no more appealing as a force 

420
00:25:56,361 --> 00:26:01,361
that drives certain ideas out of 
existence than the government is,

421
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:06,880
but I'm also concerned from the point of
view of educating and persuading and you

422
00:26:10,721 --> 00:26:11,554
know,
I've met people that have been not only 

423
00:26:14,751 --> 00:26:18,920
members,
but leaders of hate groups who have come

424
00:26:18,921 --> 00:26:19,754
to see that they were wrong,
who have come to realize that all of us 

425
00:26:26,121 --> 00:26:26,954
are equal and entitled to equal dignity 
and equal rights and they've repudiated 

426
00:26:31,971 --> 00:26:36,971
their formerly discriminatory ideas and 
they didn't come to that change by being

427
00:26:38,631 --> 00:26:39,464
denounced as racists,
much less as what happened in Europe by 

428
00:26:43,080 --> 00:26:45,690
being imprisoned as,
as racist.

429
00:26:45,870 --> 00:26:46,703
So if our goal truly is to gain more 
support on the part of more people for 

430
00:26:52,201 --> 00:26:53,034
the ideals of liberty and justice and 
human rights and equality and dignity 

431
00:26:56,581 --> 00:26:59,740
for all,
I think we don't do it by,

432
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:00,633
by shouting them down.
So it's a strategic question as well as 

433
00:27:04,351 --> 00:27:06,210
a PR.
A principled question.

434
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:07,153
Yeah.
Is that just one of those things where 

435
00:27:08,001 --> 00:27:12,440
it's like in the moment that we live in,
we often don't live up to our ideals and

436
00:27:12,441 --> 00:27:13,274
the best way possible because you 
referenced being constitutional law 

437
00:27:15,261 --> 00:27:16,094
professor and I've got the declaration 
of independence and the constitution 

438
00:27:19,251 --> 00:27:22,550
framed right in that room right over 
there and it's like these guys that were

439
00:27:22,551 --> 00:27:23,384
writing these incredible documents that 
have given more freedom to more people 

440
00:27:26,150 --> 00:27:28,710
than in the history of the world.
Well,

441
00:27:28,711 --> 00:27:29,544
some of them were slave owners and and 
plenty of other things and probably 

442
00:27:32,121 --> 00:27:32,954
womanizers and whatever and it's like,
but yet they were writing the things 

443
00:27:36,381 --> 00:27:39,080
that freed us,
which is an incredible and that's just a

444
00:27:39,081 --> 00:27:40,250
little something about being human.

445
00:27:40,250 --> 00:27:41,083
Nice book and I think it ties back to 
some of our earlier conversation that 

446
00:27:44,900 --> 00:27:45,733
I'm so much of what passes as debate,
such as your hecklers at the University 

447
00:27:53,510 --> 00:27:54,343
of New Hampshire is not genuinely 
engaged in really trying to relate to 

448
00:27:59,991 --> 00:28:04,010
you as a full fledged human being with 
whom they might.

449
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:04,993
I have absolutely no doubt based on my 
experience that there are no two people 

450
00:28:09,561 --> 00:28:14,561
in the world who won't have at least 
some strong common concern,

451
00:28:15,800 --> 00:28:20,630
some idea that they passion,
that they both deeply care about and are

452
00:28:20,631 --> 00:28:21,464
committed to and and some that they 
deeply disagree about and I think it's 

453
00:28:26,090 --> 00:28:28,610
really important not to paper over the 
disagreements.

454
00:28:28,611 --> 00:28:31,460
I think we should discuss them and hash 
them out,

455
00:28:31,700 --> 00:28:32,533
but I think we can do that more 
constructively and effectively if we 

456
00:28:35,871 --> 00:28:40,480
also find what we have in common and 
relate to each other in,

457
00:28:40,490 --> 00:28:41,990
in a holistic way.

458
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:45,320
Alright.
So there does seem to me to be a rebirth

459
00:28:45,800 --> 00:28:49,790
of a defense of free speech starting 
again on the left possibly.

460
00:28:49,970 --> 00:28:51,500
I see a little southern happening.
I did.

461
00:28:51,501 --> 00:28:52,334
Jonathan hated heterodox and some of the
other organizations you're involved in 

462
00:28:54,921 --> 00:28:55,754
in fire.
There is this group of people kind of 

463
00:28:58,280 --> 00:29:01,790
making a comeback on the left.
I'm not so sure it can hold,

464
00:29:01,880 --> 00:29:05,420
I hope it can hold,
but what do you make of how this sort of

465
00:29:05,870 --> 00:29:06,703
bounces back where sometimes free speech
is something that the left holds more 

466
00:29:09,471 --> 00:29:10,304
deer.
Sometimes it's finding the right holds 

467
00:29:10,941 --> 00:29:14,340
more deer and it kind of switches as the
decades go ahead

468
00:29:14,530 --> 00:29:18,220
from my perspective,
and I'm not far be it for me to pull out

469
00:29:18,221 --> 00:29:19,054
the age card,
but I think a few more decades than you 

470
00:29:21,431 --> 00:29:22,264
have and and it's been a constant that 
was very well summed up by nat handoff 

471
00:29:27,740 --> 00:29:28,600
home.
You would have loved,

472
00:29:28,601 --> 00:29:30,370
I don't know if you ever crossed paths 
with him,

473
00:29:31,030 --> 00:29:31,863
but he was a great free speech stalwart 
and he wrote a book whose title really 

474
00:29:35,771 --> 00:29:39,430
says it all,
freedom of speech for me,

475
00:29:39,610 --> 00:29:40,443
but not for me,
how the left and right relentlessly 

476
00:29:44,291 --> 00:29:47,050
sensor each other and he wrote that 
decades ago,

477
00:29:47,350 --> 00:29:52,350
but it's always been true that most 
people being ill man,

478
00:29:53,620 --> 00:29:54,453
believe in free speech in general,
thought those ideas that they hate or 

479
00:29:59,381 --> 00:30:02,050
despise or think are dangerous should be
the exception.

480
00:30:02,051 --> 00:30:05,770
Let's go back to skokie where a clu 
members,

481
00:30:05,830 --> 00:30:10,480
even 15 percent of these die hard 
stalwart clu members.

482
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:14,470
I'm not surprised that the one exception
they want to make is for speech.

483
00:30:14,471 --> 00:30:17,920
That's Dan grading,
civil liberties and human rights,

484
00:30:17,921 --> 00:30:18,754
but I had a friend who was the executive
director of the National Coalition 

485
00:30:22,840 --> 00:30:24,310
Against Censorship and she put it so 
well.

486
00:30:24,311 --> 00:30:29,311
She said Nadine,
everyone has his or her skokie.

487
00:30:30,130 --> 00:30:30,963
So at particular times I can tell you 
for every year I can tell you this was 

488
00:30:36,160 --> 00:30:40,600
the one exception or maybe more than one
exception that liberals want to make and

489
00:30:40,601 --> 00:30:42,910
this is the one that conservatives 
wanted to make.

490
00:30:43,080 --> 00:30:45,370
And I would say in general,
you know,

491
00:30:45,371 --> 00:30:46,204
like,
um,

492
00:30:46,360 --> 00:30:47,193
uh,
let's amend the constitution so that it 

493
00:30:50,021 --> 00:30:55,021
is a crime to burn the American flag 
that has been supported by many,

494
00:30:57,161 --> 00:31:01,510
if not most conservatives and by a lot 
of liberals as well.

495
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:03,610
That.
And there's not been,

496
00:31:03,850 --> 00:31:04,683
I think that is the single most hated 
expression in my lifetime because no 

497
00:31:09,731 --> 00:31:14,731
other expression has led to a 
constitutional amendment coming within a

498
00:31:15,131 --> 00:31:20,131
hair's breadth of being ratified more 
than two thirds of the Senate.

499
00:31:20,800 --> 00:31:21,633
I'm sorry if the House approved,
it came within one vote short of two 

500
00:31:25,361 --> 00:31:28,600
thirds of the Senate and more than three
fourths of the states.

501
00:31:28,840 --> 00:31:29,570
So all of it.

502
00:31:29,570 --> 00:31:32,220
That's when was that?
Maybe that was mid nineties.

503
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:33,930
Maybe something around there.
Wow.

504
00:31:33,990 --> 00:31:35,910
That's incredible actually,
if you think about it.

505
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:37,190
Yeah.
Where,

506
00:31:37,190 --> 00:31:41,070
where do you think trump kind of fits 
into the general discussion?

507
00:31:41,080 --> 00:31:41,913
Because he loved.
It seems to me that there is obviously 

508
00:31:43,891 --> 00:31:48,720
some sort of authoritarian bent to him.
That being said,

509
00:31:48,750 --> 00:31:49,770
we're not being.
People are,

510
00:31:49,771 --> 00:31:53,610
as far as I know people are being jailed
because of free speech at the moment.

511
00:31:54,090 --> 00:31:57,920
Do you think our institutions,
let's say that his worst critics,

512
00:31:58,590 --> 00:32:00,480
we're write about whatever they think 
about him.

513
00:32:00,750 --> 00:32:04,740
Do you think our institutions at this 
point are strong enough to ward off that

514
00:32:04,741 --> 00:32:07,620
kind of threat and we don't even have to
make it about trump specifically,

515
00:32:07,621 --> 00:32:11,340
but if there was truly like a real 
authoritarian in office,

516
00:32:11,610 --> 00:32:12,443
do you think that the way our balance of
powers and our separation of powers 

517
00:32:14,941 --> 00:32:15,530
works,

518
00:32:15,530 --> 00:32:17,010
and again,
I would have to say,

519
00:32:17,011 --> 00:32:17,844
you know,
trump has certainly done a lot of saber 

520
00:32:20,241 --> 00:32:22,950
rattling on free speech issues and you 
know,

521
00:32:22,970 --> 00:32:25,160
said that flag burners should be 
deported.

522
00:32:25,161 --> 00:32:29,270
But let us not forget that Barack Obama 
was responsible for,

523
00:32:29,480 --> 00:32:30,313
uh,
the most stringent enforcement of the 

524
00:32:32,181 --> 00:32:33,014
espionage act and you know,
pressing criminal charges against more 

525
00:32:37,580 --> 00:32:41,450
whistleblowers than all or prior 
administrations added together.

526
00:32:41,451 --> 00:32:44,660
So again,
a pox on both your houses.

527
00:32:45,510 --> 00:32:46,343
So far,
the courts have been a wonderful 

528
00:32:49,500 --> 00:32:50,333
bulwark.
The flag burning example is a really 

529
00:32:52,731 --> 00:32:53,564
good one.
It was a two supreme court decisions 

530
00:32:57,020 --> 00:32:57,853
joined by both conservatives and 
liberals on the court that struck down 

531
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:03,553
under the First Amendment,
laws that criminalized desecrating the 

532
00:33:06,921 --> 00:33:08,450
American flag.
Well,

533
00:33:08,451 --> 00:33:10,970
the Supreme Court doesn't have quite the
last word,

534
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:13,520
a constitutional amendment could 
overturn it,

535
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:14,593
but I have great confidence that this 
court would continue to uphold what has 

536
00:33:20,691 --> 00:33:25,691
been called the bedrock principle of 
freedom of speech and that his viewpoint

537
00:33:26,061 --> 00:33:28,160
neutrality.
I summarized it earlier,

538
00:33:28,161 --> 00:33:31,430
that the mere fact that the viewpoint is
hated,

539
00:33:31,460 --> 00:33:36,140
whether it be flag burning or whether it
be racist speech that has never adjusted

540
00:33:36,141 --> 00:33:36,974
vacation for censorship again,
they unanimously endorsed that last 

541
00:33:41,090 --> 00:33:42,740
summer in a hate speech case.
Yeah.

542
00:33:43,020 --> 00:33:44,770
Well,
it's slightly shift for a second.

543
00:33:44,771 --> 00:33:45,604
So when you were the head of the Acu,
what are the political pressures that 

544
00:33:49,631 --> 00:33:52,720
you're under that maybe the average 
person wouldn't know from the,

545
00:33:52,750 --> 00:33:57,080
from the headlines,
like involvement with politicians,

546
00:33:57,090 --> 00:33:58,550
with lobbyists,
etc.

547
00:33:58,600 --> 00:33:59,040
Etc.

548
00:33:59,040 --> 00:33:59,873
So at thE acl you was at his and I was 
personally involved in lobbying and 

549
00:34:05,851 --> 00:34:06,684
testifying.
I still do to testify before congress 

550
00:34:08,971 --> 00:34:10,560
occasionally.
Uh,

551
00:34:10,561 --> 00:34:11,394
and I would say to me it was a very 
privileged position because we did not 

552
00:34:16,921 --> 00:34:21,921
have to be directly concerned about 
partisan political pressures.

553
00:34:22,440 --> 00:34:23,273
We could Simply make alliances and work 
with anybody that we thought could 

554
00:34:28,111 --> 00:34:28,944
support an issue that advanced our cars 
even if we disagreed with them on other 

555
00:34:34,951 --> 00:34:36,210
issues.
And I remember,

556
00:34:36,420 --> 00:34:38,970
uh,
to me it was a great source of pleasure.

557
00:34:38,971 --> 00:34:39,804
I remember on one piece of legislation 
testifying before the senate judiciary 

558
00:34:45,751 --> 00:34:46,584
committee and the chair was orrin hatch 
and the ranking a minority minority 

559
00:34:51,961 --> 00:34:52,794
member was ted kennedy.
and they were both supportIng the same 

560
00:34:57,001 --> 00:34:57,834
pro civil liberties positions.
And I was testifying together with the 

561
00:35:01,111 --> 00:35:01,944
head of the national association of 
evangelicalism and the head of the 

562
00:35:06,361 --> 00:35:07,230
mormon church.

563
00:35:07,230 --> 00:35:10,830
And despite all of the differences on so
many other issues,

564
00:35:10,831 --> 00:35:11,664
the fact that we could make common 
concern that was on principles of 

565
00:35:14,761 --> 00:35:17,640
religious liberty and freedom of thought
and freedom of belief,

566
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:21,900
that's what I feel is deteriorating a 
little bit.

567
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:23,153
Uh,
so last year I testified a couple of 

568
00:35:25,381 --> 00:35:26,214
times on campus free speech issues and 
the bipartisanship had really worn down 

569
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:36,840
even though the theme was freedom of 
speech on.

570
00:35:37,380 --> 00:35:38,213
And even though the chair of the 
committee who was lamar alexander 

571
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:44,520
republican and patty murray,
the ranking member democrat,

572
00:35:44,670 --> 00:35:47,370
they were both really solid and great on
the issue,

573
00:35:47,610 --> 00:35:48,443
but the other members of the committee 
just used it as opportunities to try it 

574
00:35:52,080 --> 00:35:56,490
out.
Their own ideas of which free speech was

575
00:35:56,491 --> 00:35:57,324
bad and should be suppressed.
So some of the republicans were saying 

576
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:03,180
taking a knee by athletes should be 
punished.

577
00:36:03,181 --> 00:36:07,650
And some of the democrats were really 
saying trump is violating free speech.

578
00:36:07,650 --> 00:36:10,440
And there was too much political 
grandstanding.

579
00:36:10,790 --> 00:36:13,080
And that's why for as critical as I am 
for the left,

580
00:36:13,081 --> 00:36:13,914
I don't want free speech to become.
I don't want it to be a political issue 

581
00:36:17,071 --> 00:36:19,560
in the first place.
I don't want it to be that the right,

582
00:36:19,770 --> 00:36:24,480
which at the moment I see more tolerance
related to diversity of ideas.

583
00:36:24,840 --> 00:36:27,720
I don't want that to be the home.
I want there to be a balance.

584
00:36:27,721 --> 00:36:29,610
Otherwise we're just going to end up in 
that.

585
00:36:30,530 --> 00:36:31,363
Maybe a little bit skeptical,
but I think that people tend to be 

586
00:36:33,751 --> 00:36:36,190
result oriented and that,
uh,

587
00:36:36,220 --> 00:36:37,053
on the right,
there may be much more support for 

588
00:36:38,521 --> 00:36:39,354
freedom of speech on campus because they
see that it's views on the right that 

589
00:36:42,871 --> 00:36:44,970
are being squelched now.
In fairness,

590
00:36:44,971 --> 00:36:47,280
I'll give you a counterexample,
uh,

591
00:36:47,340 --> 00:36:52,170
many years ago during this first surge 
of political correctness on campus,

592
00:36:52,440 --> 00:36:54,440
mitch mcconnell,
um,

593
00:36:54,680 --> 00:36:55,410
uh,
let me,

594
00:36:55,410 --> 00:36:57,180
let me,
let me put it backwards.

595
00:36:58,460 --> 00:37:00,660
It was Henry Hyde,
I'm sorry,

596
00:37:00,661 --> 00:37:01,494
a conservative catholic from Illinois 
who was completely on the opposite side 

597
00:37:07,141 --> 00:37:10,200
of the acl,
you on abortion and gay rights.

598
00:37:10,420 --> 00:37:11,253
And he really was so strong on campus 
free speech that he sponsored a bill 

599
00:37:18,090 --> 00:37:18,923
that would have required all private 
universities to respeCt the same free 

600
00:37:24,211 --> 00:37:25,044
speech rights that public universities 
are required to observe under the 

601
00:37:28,741 --> 00:37:31,170
constitution.
Many people don't know this,

602
00:37:31,171 --> 00:37:35,820
but the constitution only applies to 
government including state universities,

603
00:37:35,821 --> 00:37:38,330
but not private university.
How did you guys feel about.

604
00:37:38,370 --> 00:37:40,150
Well,
we totally supportive the legis.

605
00:37:40,170 --> 00:37:41,003
Again,
that would be a difference between 

606
00:37:41,910 --> 00:37:45,870
libertarians and civil libertarians.
My libertarian friends would say,

607
00:37:46,080 --> 00:37:49,350
keep the government out of it,
let the private institutions decide.

608
00:37:49,590 --> 00:37:52,530
And there were exemptions for religious 
institutions.

609
00:37:52,531 --> 00:37:55,020
But basically I think that's where I 
would fall on this.

610
00:37:55,021 --> 00:37:56,660
So sell me,
sell me yoU your way then.

611
00:37:56,750 --> 00:37:59,340
It's a very interesting debate and I can
understand,

612
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:00,470
um,
but the person,

613
00:38:00,510 --> 00:38:01,343
and you know,
I've had this discussion with my dear 

614
00:38:02,911 --> 00:38:05,550
friends of the cato institute for many,
many years now.

615
00:38:05,551 --> 00:38:06,384
What's the difference between a 
classical liberal or libertarian is 

616
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:10,380
civil libertarian?
Uh,

617
00:38:10,381 --> 00:38:11,214
I think that we are less opposed to 
government regulation when it is in the 

618
00:38:16,081 --> 00:38:16,914
service of regulating very powerful 
private sector actors that for all 

619
00:38:22,981 --> 00:38:23,814
practical purposes,
the way we were talking about civil 

620
00:38:26,341 --> 00:38:31,341
society earlier can exercise coercive 
power that stifles people's liberty.

621
00:38:32,401 --> 00:38:34,780
So,
so what if you,

622
00:38:34,900 --> 00:38:36,450
uh,
if you,

623
00:38:36,460 --> 00:38:38,530
if,
if we did not have the 19,

624
00:38:38,531 --> 00:38:43,531
64 civil rights act than even the most 
powerful large landlord,

625
00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:46,660
employer,
corporation,

626
00:38:46,661 --> 00:38:47,494
private university or etc,
would be able to discriminate on the 

627
00:38:50,501 --> 00:38:53,260
basis of race or gender under federal 
law.

628
00:38:53,261 --> 00:38:56,320
They still can on the basis of sexual 
orientation,

629
00:38:56,740 --> 00:38:57,573
I would view that as something that 
could and should be remedied through 

630
00:39:00,911 --> 00:39:03,280
passing a statute.

631
00:39:03,370 --> 00:39:08,320
Making that illegal.
So usually report into,

632
00:39:08,840 --> 00:39:10,530
well I think.
Well first off,

633
00:39:10,540 --> 00:39:12,100
I agree with you your basic premise 
here,

634
00:39:12,101 --> 00:39:12,934
just at the idea level,
it's a great place for a rich 

635
00:39:14,681 --> 00:39:15,550
conversation.
Yeah.

636
00:39:15,910 --> 00:39:20,140
The idea that the government would be 
coming in and telling private schools,

637
00:39:20,620 --> 00:39:22,060
even though I understand what you're 
saying,

638
00:39:22,420 --> 00:39:24,910
that they would have to adhere to these 
codes.

639
00:39:24,970 --> 00:39:25,803
Even if I being the first amendment,
I don't necessarily think of private 

640
00:39:30,401 --> 00:39:31,234
school should have to do that.
I just think that ultimately the market 

641
00:39:33,960 --> 00:39:35,800
would.
You'd either decide you want to go there

642
00:39:35,801 --> 00:39:37,870
or don't want to go there.
This one,

643
00:39:37,871 --> 00:39:39,520
this one is definitely a tough one for 
me.

644
00:39:39,840 --> 00:39:40,673
It's an interesting one and I definitely
can see the other side and I certainly 

645
00:39:43,301 --> 00:39:48,301
would insist on some exemptions.
Certainly for religious schools.

646
00:39:48,521 --> 00:39:51,310
I think military schools were also 
exempt it.

647
00:39:51,550 --> 00:39:52,383
But then I want to give you another 
example of a republican that I worked 

648
00:39:56,021 --> 00:39:57,370
with,
mitch mcconnell,

649
00:39:57,700 --> 00:39:58,533
uh,
worked very closely with the acl in 

650
00:40:01,060 --> 00:40:02,140
opposing.

651
00:40:02,500 --> 00:40:04,690
Many people are going to be surprised to
hear this.

652
00:40:05,230 --> 00:40:06,063
The mccain feingold law a campaign,
so-called campaign finance like a 

653
00:40:10,651 --> 00:40:12,320
lifetime ago.
We don't talk about that.

654
00:40:12,580 --> 00:40:14,500
A clu very,
you know,

655
00:40:14,501 --> 00:40:15,334
we're the ones who argued buckley versus
valeo and arguing that the ability to 

656
00:40:20,350 --> 00:40:21,183
spend money in order to promote a 
message is protected free speech and it 

657
00:40:27,911 --> 00:40:28,744
should be protected even when the speech
is engaged in by people who are 

658
00:40:33,130 --> 00:40:33,963
organized into a group and including if 
they're organized in the form of a 

659
00:40:38,681 --> 00:40:42,280
corporation or a union or not for profit
corporation.

660
00:40:42,281 --> 00:40:43,114
so some liberals are really distressed 
by that position and I think it's 

661
00:40:46,481 --> 00:40:49,630
absolutely the correct line anyway.
What do you say to those?

662
00:40:49,660 --> 00:40:53,170
Those liberals are the lefties who do 
get more upset about that in general,

663
00:40:53,171 --> 00:40:54,004
that you're just going to allow 
corporations to endlessly pour money in 

664
00:40:56,171 --> 00:40:58,090
the system and manipulate the system.

665
00:40:58,090 --> 00:40:59,260
And that's it.
Well,

666
00:41:00,070 --> 00:41:02,650
again,
what is the lesser of two evils?

667
00:41:02,651 --> 00:41:07,651
Would I rather have the government 
telling corporations such as the acl,

668
00:41:08,231 --> 00:41:12,100
you and planned parenthood and the 
sierra club,

669
00:41:12,101 --> 00:41:12,934
you name your favorite left wing,
so called cause and it is organized 

670
00:41:16,931 --> 00:41:21,070
incorporate form and the acu under that 
law was,

671
00:41:21,130 --> 00:41:21,963
it would have been a crime to go on the 
airwaves and by name call on people who 

672
00:41:27,671 --> 00:41:30,190
are running for federal office and say,
you know,

673
00:41:30,191 --> 00:41:32,290
repeal the patriot act,
uh,

674
00:41:32,650 --> 00:41:33,483
because arguing for issues over the 
broadcast airwaves was a crime under 

675
00:41:39,651 --> 00:41:44,651
that law and spending your own money to 
advance your own issue oriented message.

676
00:41:45,981 --> 00:41:46,814
So I think people are shocked When they 
hear what the law actually did and are 

677
00:41:50,721 --> 00:41:54,350
persuaded that in at least some 
applications that went too far.

678
00:41:54,650 --> 00:41:55,483
Well,
mcconnell became such a supporter of 

679
00:41:58,101 --> 00:41:58,934
free speech as a result of working on 
this issue that he actually changed his 

680
00:42:04,041 --> 00:42:04,874
position on the flag burning amendment.
He had been a big proponent of it and 

681
00:42:10,430 --> 00:42:11,263
having seen how important freedom of 
speech was including for what to 

682
00:42:16,251 --> 00:42:19,790
liberals,
is a very controversial form of speech,

683
00:42:19,791 --> 00:42:22,490
namely spending money in the political 
process.

684
00:42:23,330 --> 00:42:24,141
He said,
well,

685
00:42:24,141 --> 00:42:26,900
you know,
I've got to stick to principles here and

686
00:42:27,620 --> 00:42:32,620
we should not amend the constitution to 
outlaw another controversial expression.

687
00:42:33,691 --> 00:42:34,524
So I thought that was a really wonderful
idea of not just being result oriented 

688
00:42:38,091 --> 00:42:43,091
toward your own ideological concerns,
but seeing the overarching principle and

689
00:42:43,280 --> 00:42:44,113
following it.

690
00:42:44,280 --> 00:42:46,200
It's almost like if you actually have 
the debate,

691
00:42:46,201 --> 00:42:50,100
you might change people's mind and be 
surprised who your allies are.

692
00:42:50,610 --> 00:42:51,443
Is there any country that is protecting 
these rights better than we are for as 

693
00:42:56,281 --> 00:42:57,990
screwy as our system may be?

694
00:42:58,400 --> 00:42:59,840
No.
Uh,

695
00:43:00,050 --> 00:43:04,160
well let me make a,
a on sexual expression.

696
00:43:04,190 --> 00:43:09,190
The United States is a much more 
repressive than a european.

697
00:43:10,160 --> 00:43:13,390
Some many european countries.
But like in what regard?

698
00:43:13,410 --> 00:43:15,110
You mean with what can be seen in 
magazines or.

699
00:43:15,640 --> 00:43:17,660
yeah,
so we still have a,

700
00:43:17,661 --> 00:43:21,440
I mean not only sexual expression but 
four letter words.

701
00:43:21,441 --> 00:43:22,274
I mean,
thank goodness we're not broadcasting 

702
00:43:24,350 --> 00:43:28,260
because I still get bleeped even when I 
try to do whatever you want,

703
00:43:28,340 --> 00:43:30,050
all seven of them.
Well,

704
00:43:30,110 --> 00:43:30,943
and,
and,

705
00:43:31,020 --> 00:43:35,210
and one of them appears,
and I'm not even sure if this was one of

706
00:43:35,211 --> 00:43:37,100
these seven,
but fuck,

707
00:43:37,160 --> 00:43:42,160
the draft was upheld as of in a very 
important free speech case.

708
00:43:43,800 --> 00:43:44,633
It that by the United States supreme 
court and it's a case that has 

709
00:43:47,661 --> 00:43:48,494
ramifications for hate speech as well,
but I cannot describe the facts of that 

710
00:43:52,911 --> 00:43:56,020
case on radio or tv and you know,
that's,

711
00:43:56,021 --> 00:43:57,200
that's laughable.

712
00:43:57,200 --> 00:44:01,130
And other countries and we still have 
anti obscenity.

713
00:44:01,160 --> 00:44:01,910
Well,
I mean,

714
00:44:01,910 --> 00:44:05,400
let's not forget that the brouhaha about
the,

715
00:44:05,440 --> 00:44:09,350
the wardrobe malfunction at super bowl,
I mean it's,

716
00:44:09,351 --> 00:44:10,184
so we're much more puritanical,
but when it comes to political 

717
00:44:12,921 --> 00:44:13,754
expression,
there is no country that gives as much 

718
00:44:16,611 --> 00:44:20,060
protection as we do,
including for hateful,

719
00:44:20,090 --> 00:44:25,090
racist speech and misogynistic speech,
including for defamation,

720
00:44:25,831 --> 00:44:26,664
you know,
a defamatory falsehoods about public 

721
00:44:29,601 --> 00:44:32,670
officials and public figures.
And that's why,

722
00:44:32,940 --> 00:44:33,773
uh,
there are so many libel lawsuits that 

723
00:44:35,581 --> 00:44:36,414
are brought in the uk against what would
be clearly protected speech in this 

724
00:44:39,781 --> 00:44:40,430
country.

725
00:44:40,430 --> 00:44:41,263
Yeah.
But you do believe in our libel laws 

726
00:44:42,621 --> 00:44:43,454
here.

727
00:44:43,490 --> 00:44:46,160
Uh,
yes,

728
00:44:46,170 --> 00:44:46,921
I,
you know,

729
00:44:46,921 --> 00:44:47,251
I,
I,

730
00:44:47,251 --> 00:44:50,190
I'm sure I would want to trim them back 
a little bit,

731
00:44:50,191 --> 00:44:55,191
but on the whole were quite protective.
So if it's a matter of public concern or

732
00:44:57,001 --> 00:45:01,950
public official or public figure,
you get quite a bit of leeway.

733
00:45:01,951 --> 00:45:06,951
You can't be held culpable unless you 
have acted intentionally or recklessly.

734
00:45:08,251 --> 00:45:09,084
and I think that's correct.
And one of the things they're pretty 

735
00:45:10,651 --> 00:45:11,341
specific.
Yeah.

736
00:45:11,341 --> 00:45:12,174
One of the things that trump wanted to 
do as he said was to reform the libel 

737
00:45:15,121 --> 00:45:18,510
laws to make it easier for a public 
official to,

738
00:45:18,750 --> 00:45:20,850
to collect damages.
And you know,

739
00:45:20,851 --> 00:45:22,470
a lot of people say,
oh,

740
00:45:22,471 --> 00:45:26,790
come on to dean britain and Germany and 
France and Canada and Australia,

741
00:45:26,791 --> 00:45:27,624
you know,
it's not as if they are to tell a in 

742
00:45:29,341 --> 00:45:30,174
authoritarian countries,
but if you read the examples in my book 

743
00:45:33,090 --> 00:45:38,090
of the kinds of speech that are being 
punished even with imprisonment,

744
00:45:38,460 --> 00:45:40,890
even with a criminal fines.

745
00:45:40,890 --> 00:45:45,150
And that's the tip of the iceberg 
because for every punishment there is,

746
00:45:45,151 --> 00:45:49,440
there are countless numbers of,
of self censorship incidence.

747
00:45:49,620 --> 00:45:52,680
It would really make your skin crawl.
But give examples,

748
00:45:52,890 --> 00:45:53,723
no matter what your ideology is,
you should find something in there that 

749
00:45:56,551 --> 00:45:57,660
you would say,
oh my goodness,

750
00:45:57,661 --> 00:45:59,040
I can't believe it.
So,

751
00:45:59,041 --> 00:45:59,970
you know,
uh,

752
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:02,310
France,
a couple of years ago,

753
00:46:02,910 --> 00:46:03,743
criminally convicted,
they had a gay rights organization for 

754
00:46:09,091 --> 00:46:09,924
calling the head of an anti gay rights 
organization off homophobe that was 

755
00:46:14,431 --> 00:46:16,890
considered to be hate speech.
Now,

756
00:46:16,891 --> 00:46:18,960
fortunately she wasn't sentenced to 
prison,

757
00:46:19,200 --> 00:46:22,560
but she was subject to a very stiff,
fine,

758
00:46:22,830 --> 00:46:25,180
$3,500.
Uh,

759
00:46:25,190 --> 00:46:25,711
and,
and,

760
00:46:25,711 --> 00:46:28,410
and then you think,
what are the ripple effects of that?

761
00:46:28,610 --> 00:46:30,930
Yeah.
Have you guys track this case with,

762
00:46:31,050 --> 00:46:34,890
uh,
the comedian in the uk who had the dog?

763
00:46:34,980 --> 00:46:35,541
Oh,
yes,

764
00:46:35,541 --> 00:46:36,374
absolutely.
Yes.

765
00:46:36,960 --> 00:46:37,651
I mean,
again,

766
00:46:37,651 --> 00:46:38,484
like,
it's like,

767
00:46:39,240 --> 00:46:41,010
all right,
first off he was making a joke.

768
00:46:41,310 --> 00:46:44,310
there's no,
there's no exception for humor or satire

769
00:46:44,910 --> 00:46:45,743
when the new online hate speech laws 
went into effect in Germany on January 

770
00:46:50,970 --> 00:46:51,803
1st,
the first person convicted or charged 

771
00:46:54,031 --> 00:46:57,930
under it was one of the leaders of a 
right wing party.

772
00:46:57,960 --> 00:47:00,420
Not surprisingly,
but the very in the.

773
00:47:00,421 --> 00:47:03,240
MAybe the first two that were charged 
were from that party,

774
00:47:03,420 --> 00:47:04,253
but the very next one was a satirical 
magazine that was making fun of their 

775
00:47:09,630 --> 00:47:11,400
statements,
mocking them,

776
00:47:11,401 --> 00:47:13,310
ridIculing and,
and,

777
00:47:13,320 --> 00:47:14,153
and,
and these laws by being so subjective 

778
00:47:15,631 --> 00:47:18,080
can't make the fine distinctions between
humor,

779
00:47:18,081 --> 00:47:20,370
satire and straightforward advocacy.

780
00:47:20,570 --> 00:47:21,403
Yeah.
So my audience knows I'm not big on the 

781
00:47:23,240 --> 00:47:27,240
globalist ideas here or even the un I 
think is mostly a forest at this point,

782
00:47:27,250 --> 00:47:30,790
but do we need some sort of internet 
bill of rights?

783
00:47:30,791 --> 00:47:31,624
I mean this is a new phrase that we're,
that seems to be popping up over the 

784
00:47:34,570 --> 00:47:38,540
last year or so that will uniformly 
protect people in other country from,

785
00:47:38,910 --> 00:47:39,743
be for their ability to say things that 
are uncomfortable online and be able to 

786
00:47:43,541 --> 00:47:44,930
tweet things,
uh,

787
00:47:45,110 --> 00:47:45,761
that,
you know,

788
00:47:45,761 --> 00:47:48,220
you can't say in Germany,
but you can say in the United States,

789
00:47:48,260 --> 00:47:49,093
I,
I think we have to do that on a country 

790
00:47:50,711 --> 00:47:51,544
by country basis.
And I am pleased that there are 

791
00:47:54,970 --> 00:47:59,970
advocates in other countries that really
strongly support freedom of speech,

792
00:48:00,910 --> 00:48:01,743
including for hate speech.
I keep putting that in air quotes 

793
00:48:04,391 --> 00:48:05,224
because it is,
as I say to that person and you're at 

794
00:48:07,751 --> 00:48:11,380
the university of New Hampshire now,
there really is no such thing.

795
00:48:11,381 --> 00:48:12,214
And by the way,
there are a lot of what they saId to 

796
00:48:13,601 --> 00:48:14,434
you.
Some people would consider to be hate 

797
00:48:15,731 --> 00:48:16,564
speech too.
So that's another argument that you 

798
00:48:18,521 --> 00:48:19,170
could have made.

799
00:48:19,170 --> 00:48:23,070
Do you realize that's my one regret is 
at one point when she said to me,

800
00:48:23,071 --> 00:48:23,904
I said something about losing holocaust,
a family members from august on both 

801
00:48:26,701 --> 00:48:27,534
sides and then later she said they're 
rolling in their graves over what I'm 

802
00:48:30,781 --> 00:48:31,440
saying.
I mean,

803
00:48:31,440 --> 00:48:33,060
trying to think like if this,
if we're really,

804
00:48:33,250 --> 00:48:35,460
if we're really gauging the offense 
meter,

805
00:48:36,240 --> 00:48:37,073
I assure you there was nothing that I 
said in those two hours that was more 

806
00:48:40,021 --> 00:48:40,854
wildly offensive than that.
But do I want her jailed because of 

807
00:48:43,501 --> 00:48:44,334
that?
I mean,

808
00:48:44,370 --> 00:48:45,390
of course not.
Yeah.

809
00:48:45,660 --> 00:48:46,493
So I,
I really was heartened at how much 

810
00:48:49,800 --> 00:48:54,090
support there is for the american 
approach.

811
00:48:54,130 --> 00:48:55,350
We,
we're often,

812
00:48:55,390 --> 00:48:56,223
uh,
attacked as being american 

813
00:48:58,140 --> 00:49:03,140
exceptionalists and it wouldn't bother 
me if we were the only ones in the,

814
00:49:03,230 --> 00:49:04,063
in the world that we're defending our 
free speech principles as long as that 

815
00:49:07,111 --> 00:49:07,944
is the right thing to do,
but it's interesting that other people 

816
00:49:10,201 --> 00:49:15,201
having seen despite the good intentions 
of sensorial laws elsewhere,

817
00:49:15,541 --> 00:49:16,374
how they are leading to results that no 
thinking person should accept and 

818
00:49:20,880 --> 00:49:25,110
handing over to these online.
So here we get to this question again,

819
00:49:25,111 --> 00:49:26,880
and I'll put it this way,
dave,

820
00:49:26,910 --> 00:49:30,720
what's the lesser of two evils to allow 
these private,

821
00:49:31,100 --> 00:49:34,050
uh,
agglomerations of power,

822
00:49:34,350 --> 00:49:37,740
uh,
internet and companies decide,

823
00:49:37,741 --> 00:49:40,940
pick and choose whose speech is allowed 
and who's not,

824
00:49:41,280 --> 00:49:42,113
and enforcing their own concepts of hate
speech or pornography or permissible or 

825
00:49:46,381 --> 00:49:50,190
impermissible nudity to pick just a few 
examples that they enforce.

826
00:49:50,490 --> 00:49:51,323
Would I rather have them have that 
enormouS power or would I rather have 

827
00:49:54,751 --> 00:49:56,760
the government say,
no,

828
00:49:56,761 --> 00:49:57,594
we're gonna check your power to restrict
other people's free speech rights and 

829
00:50:01,801 --> 00:50:03,640
it,
to me that's a very difficult.

830
00:50:03,641 --> 00:50:03,720
Yeah.

831
00:50:03,720 --> 00:50:04,610
Yeah.
So that's it.

832
00:50:04,611 --> 00:50:05,444
Okay.
So that's exactly where we were before 

833
00:50:07,051 --> 00:50:07,884
with the universities.
That's where I would say ultimately 

834
00:50:10,050 --> 00:50:13,140
right now are for,
I don't know how many internet companies

835
00:50:13,141 --> 00:50:16,290
we have,
let's say comcast spectrum.

836
00:50:16,680 --> 00:50:18,030
They're all one at some level.

837
00:50:18,230 --> 00:50:19,063
Yeah.
You're of the net neutrality issue and 

838
00:50:20,820 --> 00:50:23,220
I'm thinking of the social media that 
you know,

839
00:50:23,280 --> 00:50:24,113
the facebooks and the twitters having 
these armies of enforcer saying that's 

840
00:50:27,651 --> 00:50:29,180
hate speech.
We're going to take it down.

841
00:50:29,280 --> 00:50:30,113
Right.
So I guess what I would say is that if 

842
00:50:31,651 --> 00:50:33,840
there were certain internet companies 
that were saying,

843
00:50:33,841 --> 00:50:34,674
all right,
well we're not going to allow 

844
00:50:35,640 --> 00:50:36,473
pornography on our pipes or we're not 
going to allow this type of speech or 

845
00:50:39,631 --> 00:50:40,464
that type of speech.
I would still prefer that you as the 

846
00:50:42,571 --> 00:50:43,404
consumer would have more choice than 
than the government saying we have to 

847
00:50:47,371 --> 00:50:50,250
enforce all these things.
But because of the,

848
00:50:50,280 --> 00:50:51,113
because of the internet,
now I know this is a unique situation 

849
00:50:53,401 --> 00:50:55,090
related to free speech.
That's a little.

850
00:50:55,210 --> 00:50:56,770
I mean,
in my ideal world,

851
00:50:56,771 --> 00:50:58,870
I'm completely with you.
The question is,

852
00:50:58,871 --> 00:51:01,090
and I'm not an economist,
my husband is,

853
00:51:01,091 --> 00:51:02,770
and he tells me that it's very 
complicated.

854
00:51:03,010 --> 00:51:03,843
Have some of them amassed so much power 
that we should use the antitrust type 

855
00:51:08,651 --> 00:51:09,484
tools to prevent them for that,
that they are denying us choice through 

856
00:51:13,961 --> 00:51:15,060
their market power.

857
00:51:15,120 --> 00:51:15,953
Right?
So this is,

858
00:51:16,010 --> 00:51:17,730
there's a great conversation to be had 
there.

859
00:51:17,731 --> 00:51:21,180
This is where my friends had prager 
university who I agree with on all sorts

860
00:51:21,181 --> 00:51:23,670
of stuff.
They were suing google,

861
00:51:23,671 --> 00:51:26,310
youtube over restrictions to their 
videos,

862
00:51:26,520 --> 00:51:27,353
which I was in for because I don't want 
the antitrust stuff to be in because to 

863
00:51:30,721 --> 00:51:31,554
me that,
that then means you Just create a 

864
00:51:32,671 --> 00:51:33,504
zillion other problems down the road.
But that's a great place for a free 

865
00:51:36,211 --> 00:51:37,044
speech person and an economist and 
probably a technology guy to all sit 

866
00:51:40,351 --> 00:51:42,600
down and work this stuff out without 
choking each other.

867
00:51:42,690 --> 00:51:43,523
There was a real,
to me really frightening story in the 

868
00:51:45,631 --> 00:51:50,631
New York times a few weeks ago featuring
a faCebook's deletion center.

869
00:51:52,890 --> 00:51:53,723
That's what it was actually called,
this huge building in berlin where they 

870
00:51:57,691 --> 00:51:58,524
had literally hundreds of people that 
are looking at individual posts and 

871
00:52:02,491 --> 00:52:05,670
deciding should this be deleted and 
should have not been deleted.

872
00:52:06,570 --> 00:52:07,700
And it was,
um,

873
00:52:07,860 --> 00:52:09,390
you know,
and the examples,

874
00:52:09,391 --> 00:52:12,870
you,
you realize how inevitably subjective it

875
00:52:12,871 --> 00:52:15,870
is.
Ultimately they took down when they took

876
00:52:15,871 --> 00:52:16,704
down this,
this comment that was posted by the 

877
00:52:19,471 --> 00:52:20,304
politician,
she was calling certain muslim men 

878
00:52:24,780 --> 00:52:27,090
rapists.
And the question was,

879
00:52:27,120 --> 00:52:27,953
was she referring to the particular 
muslim immigrants who were in fact a 

880
00:52:32,250 --> 00:52:33,083
convicted rapist?
There was a hOrrible incident on new 

881
00:52:35,520 --> 00:52:36,353
year's eve a couple of years ago,
in wHich case one would hope that would 

882
00:52:39,121 --> 00:52:39,954
be protected speech because she's 
describing something factual or was she 

883
00:52:44,010 --> 00:52:48,300
perhaps insinuating that all muslim men 
are rapists?

884
00:52:48,301 --> 00:52:51,930
Which would not be a generalization that
I would find objectionable,

885
00:52:51,931 --> 00:52:53,200
but,
and,

886
00:52:53,250 --> 00:52:55,470
but it would be illegal under german 
law.

887
00:52:55,680 --> 00:52:57,000
And the official,
you know,

888
00:52:57,001 --> 00:52:57,834
these people,
it's their whole job to make these 

889
00:52:59,401 --> 00:53:01,980
decisions.
They couldn't agree between themselves.

890
00:53:02,300 --> 00:53:06,060
and so of course,
if you're not sure which way it goes and

891
00:53:06,061 --> 00:53:10,110
you're facing a 50 million euro,
fine.

892
00:53:10,111 --> 00:53:12,390
If the german government says it is hate
speech,

893
00:53:12,480 --> 00:53:13,313
while guess what,

894
00:53:14,930 --> 00:53:15,763
what,
what do you think right now is our 

895
00:53:16,521 --> 00:53:17,354
biggest censorship threat?
Where do you think is coming on the 

896
00:53:20,901 --> 00:53:21,734
horizon?

897
00:53:21,930 --> 00:53:26,040
I'm going to be very general because 
it's been the same answer had throughout

898
00:53:26,041 --> 00:53:26,874
my decades of activism,
which is lack of public understanding 

899
00:53:31,140 --> 00:53:35,280
and awareness of whaT the first 
amendment is,

900
00:53:35,310 --> 00:53:36,143
what it does protect,
what it does not protect what the 

901
00:53:38,191 --> 00:53:39,024
rationales are.
I truly believe that the more people 

902
00:53:42,301 --> 00:53:43,134
understand both what the principles are 
and how we have evolved at toward those 

903
00:53:51,091 --> 00:53:51,924
principles,
through historic experience that people 

904
00:53:54,061 --> 00:53:55,170
will be supportive.

905
00:53:55,360 --> 00:53:58,420
So I'm curious during the whole nfl 
Kneeling thing,

906
00:53:58,810 --> 00:53:59,643
I've made a couple of videos about it 
and obviously we talked about it on the 

907
00:54:01,181 --> 00:54:03,040
show,
but I basically was saying,

908
00:54:03,041 --> 00:54:06,430
look,
this is free speech working.

909
00:54:06,760 --> 00:54:07,593
The president sAid what he said now I 
would certainly prefer that the 

910
00:54:09,971 --> 00:54:12,040
president not call people sons of 
bitches.

911
00:54:12,370 --> 00:54:14,320
Right?
But he's entitled to free speech.

912
00:54:14,321 --> 00:54:16,150
He didn't try to enact a law to stop 
him,

913
00:54:16,330 --> 00:54:19,990
so he spoke.
The players could then deal or not neil,

914
00:54:19,991 --> 00:54:21,340
so they were able to do what they 
wanted.

915
00:54:21,670 --> 00:54:24,160
The owners could then,
you know,

916
00:54:24,161 --> 00:54:27,010
find the players or not.
So they got to do what they wanted.

917
00:54:27,011 --> 00:54:27,844
The fans could say,
I'm going to buy jerseys and a 10 games 

918
00:54:30,130 --> 00:54:33,340
or I'm not good new,
so everyone speech,

919
00:54:33,430 --> 00:54:36,220
actually everyone's speech and action 
was protected.

920
00:54:36,340 --> 00:54:37,173
You might have some consequences for it,
but to me it was a great example of the 

921
00:54:40,541 --> 00:54:44,020
whole thing working messy but working.
Do you think?

922
00:54:44,270 --> 00:54:45,103
Fair summation,
totally agree with that and I had a 

923
00:54:47,300 --> 00:54:48,133
quite similar analysis myself to the 
disappointment of people who did not 

924
00:54:51,741 --> 00:54:56,741
realize that the nfl as a private entity
has its own rights,

925
00:54:57,771 --> 00:54:58,604
including its own free speech rights and
I thought it was interesting that some 

926
00:55:01,161 --> 00:55:06,161
of the owners said they would allow 
their players to express their protest.

927
00:55:06,400 --> 00:55:10,340
Is in that case though,
is trump getting it as close to where it

928
00:55:10,341 --> 00:55:15,170
could be an issue for the acl,
you or other similar organizations as he

929
00:55:15,171 --> 00:55:19,100
can without directly calling for a law 
because there is some other.

930
00:55:19,250 --> 00:55:20,083
I don't even know what that phrase is,
but there's something else happening 

931
00:55:22,461 --> 00:55:24,040
there when he's calling you or

932
00:55:24,120 --> 00:55:24,953
threatening if he were threatening to 
pass a law and he did that in one other 

933
00:55:30,261 --> 00:55:31,094
context.
I think he threatened that there should 

934
00:55:33,051 --> 00:55:33,884
be some f an fcc license should be taken
away from some broadcasts or that comes 

935
00:55:38,391 --> 00:55:40,460
much closer to the line and the 
principal.

936
00:55:40,461 --> 00:55:41,600
Dave,
you're exactly right.

937
00:55:41,750 --> 00:55:42,583
He does not give up his free speech 
rights by virtue of being a government 

938
00:55:46,730 --> 00:55:47,563
official,
but if he is speaking in official 

939
00:55:49,671 --> 00:55:51,620
capacity,
um,

940
00:55:51,710 --> 00:55:52,543
and threatening some adverse 
consequences that could be seen as an 

941
00:55:56,990 --> 00:56:01,330
abridgment of free speech under which 
would violate the frasers amendment.

942
00:56:01,340 --> 00:56:02,520
ExActly.
Uh,

943
00:56:02,521 --> 00:56:03,354
so in the past,
I think the closest supreme court case 

944
00:56:05,361 --> 00:56:06,194
we have is we're a government commission
wrote a letter that threatened that It 

945
00:56:11,541 --> 00:56:12,374
would take some action and even though 
it wasn't starting a prosecution or it 

946
00:56:16,130 --> 00:56:19,460
wasn't an order to cease the expression,
the court said,

947
00:56:19,790 --> 00:56:21,830
you know,
it was a very functional,

948
00:56:21,831 --> 00:56:22,664
practical concept.
It would a reasonable person feel 

949
00:56:26,290 --> 00:56:31,290
deterred in pursuing their free speech 
after they hear this communication.

950
00:56:32,050 --> 00:56:32,883
And again,
reasonable people can disagree about 

951
00:56:34,181 --> 00:56:37,870
what the answer to that is,
but that's the question we should put in

952
00:56:37,871 --> 00:56:41,050
evaluating whether trump has crossed the
line or not.

953
00:56:41,170 --> 00:56:42,003
So one of the things that I saw when the
nfl released its new standard now for 

954
00:56:45,101 --> 00:56:45,934
next season where the players are 
allowed to stay in the locker room or 

955
00:56:48,311 --> 00:56:48,851
not.
and again,

956
00:56:48,851 --> 00:56:52,000
everyone's choice will,
will or will not have consequence.

957
00:56:52,240 --> 00:56:57,240
I saw a lot of people that were sayiNg,
well clearly the government involved,

958
00:56:57,520 --> 00:57:00,220
you know,
interfered behind the scenes.

959
00:57:00,520 --> 00:57:01,900
Now I know there's no,
I know you don't.

960
00:57:01,920 --> 00:57:02,753
I suspect you don't have some sort of 
insider knowledge on something like 

961
00:57:04,451 --> 00:57:05,284
thAt.
That's where there would be a problem 

962
00:57:06,881 --> 00:57:08,850
though if they were really,
you know,

963
00:57:08,860 --> 00:57:09,693
behind the scenes meetings where they 
were saying you're going to institute 

964
00:57:11,471 --> 00:57:13,480
this new policy.
But beyond that,

965
00:57:13,481 --> 00:57:16,600
but short of having that information,
everything kind of work.

966
00:57:16,810 --> 00:57:18,450
Yeah,
I'm there.

967
00:57:18,970 --> 00:57:19,803
There's another analogy I can think of,
which is where the government has 

968
00:57:22,841 --> 00:57:27,841
threatened certain businesses that if 
you don't adopt a voluntary,

969
00:57:29,170 --> 00:57:33,130
a restriction on speech,
then we're going to pass legislation.

970
00:57:33,131 --> 00:57:33,964
So for example,
the movie rating system or a sound 

971
00:57:37,601 --> 00:57:38,434
recording rating systems that we think 
these labels are stigmatizing and 

972
00:57:43,091 --> 00:57:45,310
therefore suppressing certain 
expression,

973
00:57:45,670 --> 00:57:46,503
uh,
I think there's a very strong argument 

974
00:57:47,981 --> 00:57:51,250
that the only reason this so called 
voluntary system,

975
00:57:51,490 --> 00:57:52,323
uh,
was put in place in both businesses is 

976
00:57:53,951 --> 00:57:55,930
because they knew that if they didn't do
it,

977
00:57:56,140 --> 00:57:58,780
the government was going to legislate 
it.

978
00:57:59,120 --> 00:58:00,280
Uh,
but even that,

979
00:58:00,310 --> 00:58:04,090
the supreme court never held that that 
was illegal censorship.

980
00:58:04,160 --> 00:58:04,791
Yeah.
All right.

981
00:58:04,791 --> 00:58:07,970
Well we can't talk free speech for an 
hour and not mention the cake.

982
00:58:08,540 --> 00:58:10,530
We got to talk about the gay k.
Jake,

983
00:58:11,640 --> 00:58:14,610
tell Me your thoughts on the gay cake.
Okay.

984
00:58:14,611 --> 00:58:16,650
It's a I.
First of all,

985
00:58:16,651 --> 00:58:21,651
I think it involves not only expression,
which I would define quite broadly.

986
00:58:21,901 --> 00:58:23,820
And again,
let me talk about the,

987
00:58:24,070 --> 00:58:24,903
the standard here.
Reasonable people can disagree how the 

988
00:58:27,281 --> 00:58:29,190
standard applies to the facts of the 
case.

989
00:58:30,180 --> 00:58:32,790
So the court has said,
and I think this is correct,

990
00:58:32,791 --> 00:58:33,624
that something comes,
some expression comes or arguable 

991
00:58:36,481 --> 00:58:40,020
expression comes within the ambit of the
first amendment.

992
00:58:40,320 --> 00:58:45,320
If it is intended to And can reasonably 
perceived as conveying a message,

993
00:58:48,511 --> 00:58:49,344
at least a general message.
So that's the question you would ask 

994
00:58:51,721 --> 00:58:52,554
about the cake.
I think there's at least a plausible 

995
00:58:54,751 --> 00:58:58,140
argument that the cake satisfied that 
standard,

996
00:58:58,440 --> 00:59:00,870
uh,
in addition to expression,

997
00:59:00,900 --> 00:59:04,080
there's the question of religious 
liberty,

998
00:59:04,081 --> 00:59:06,600
right?
Which I defend very strongly,

999
00:59:06,601 --> 00:59:08,460
even more strongly than the supreme 
court,

1000
00:59:08,461 --> 00:59:11,260
which has a quite narrow definition now,
uh,

1001
00:59:11,280 --> 00:59:12,113
but I think people should not be coerced
generally to do something that violates 

1002
00:59:15,691 --> 00:59:19,260
their deeply held religious or 
conscientious beliefs.

1003
00:59:19,830 --> 00:59:20,663
That's only one of the equation though,
because neither freedom of speech nor 

1004
00:59:24,711 --> 00:59:28,670
religious freedom is absolute.
And in general,

1005
00:59:29,090 --> 00:59:31,010
the court has said,
and I think this is right,

1006
00:59:31,370 --> 00:59:32,203
that government can restrict those 
freedoms if it can show that there is a 

1007
00:59:37,191 --> 00:59:42,191
countervailing interests,
have such compelling importance that can

1008
00:59:43,100 --> 00:59:48,100
only be advanced by restricting the 
expression or the belief.

1009
00:59:49,340 --> 00:59:50,173
Uh,
and the countervailing interest is of 

1010
00:59:52,731 --> 00:59:57,731
course the dignity and equality of a,
in this case gay people.

1011
00:59:58,101 --> 00:59:58,934
But in past cases,
it's been african americans or women 

1012
01:00:02,151 --> 01:00:04,760
because people have cited who are in 
business,

1013
01:00:04,761 --> 01:00:05,594
have asserted religious justifications 
for not serving members of racial 

1014
01:00:11,331 --> 01:00:14,090
minorities or not treating women 
equally.

1015
01:00:14,450 --> 01:00:14,950
And,

1016
01:00:14,950 --> 01:00:15,783
but to be clear,
that's not what was happening here 

1017
01:00:17,051 --> 01:00:19,930
because they could have walked in and 
bought any cake off the shelf.

1018
01:00:19,931 --> 01:00:20,764
A black person,
an interracial couple could have a 

1019
01:00:22,870 --> 01:00:24,880
walked in and bought any cake off the 
shelf.

1020
01:00:24,881 --> 01:00:29,881
This was about this specific act that 
was going to be paint,

1021
01:00:30,130 --> 01:00:32,170
you know,
painted or whatever they do on the case.

1022
01:00:32,260 --> 01:00:33,180
Right.
You know,

1023
01:00:33,190 --> 01:00:34,420
it's interesting.
I,

1024
01:00:34,480 --> 01:00:36,520
uh,
and there's another,

1025
01:00:36,580 --> 01:00:37,413
um,
another free speech principle that's 

1026
01:00:39,401 --> 01:00:40,234
involved here,
which is that government may not compel 

1027
01:00:44,140 --> 01:00:44,973
somebody to proclaim a certain message 
that they don't believe in anymore than 

1028
01:00:50,651 --> 01:00:54,160
it may stop somebody from conveying a 
message that they,

1029
01:00:54,430 --> 01:00:58,310
that they do believe in a.
So I would say I,

1030
01:00:58,330 --> 01:00:59,270
I'm,
I'm very,

1031
01:00:59,320 --> 01:01:02,470
I think they're very strong concerns on 
both sides.

1032
01:01:02,471 --> 01:01:05,920
So I'm very sympathetic because.
Let me finish out the other argument.

1033
01:01:06,730 --> 01:01:10,810
Of course,
if you're an independent artist that is,

1034
01:01:10,811 --> 01:01:13,960
you know,
only taking assignments on commission,

1035
01:01:14,200 --> 01:01:15,033
whether it be to paint a portrait or a 
landscape or to decorate a cake and a 

1036
01:01:18,311 --> 01:01:20,710
very elaborate way.
That's one thing.

1037
01:01:20,711 --> 01:01:21,544
But if you are doing business with the 
general public and basically holding 

1038
01:01:25,931 --> 01:01:29,620
yourself out as what the law would call 
a public accommodation,

1039
01:01:29,621 --> 01:01:34,621
we're open to all commerce,
then you may not discriminate on certain

1040
01:01:34,870 --> 01:01:35,703
bases such as race,
religion and I think even though you 

1041
01:01:38,501 --> 01:01:43,501
still can as a matter of federal law 
under state law in that state and and,

1042
01:01:43,611 --> 01:01:44,444
and others,
you cannot do that on the basis of 

1043
01:01:46,061 --> 01:01:47,230
sexual orientation.

1044
01:01:47,620 --> 01:01:48,453
And so I think that very strong 
countervailing equality principle I 

1045
01:01:53,321 --> 01:01:55,550
think should,
should dominate in,

1046
01:01:55,551 --> 01:01:56,384
in this analysis.
So you actually weren't thrilled with 

1047
01:01:58,001 --> 01:01:59,830
this decision that.
Well I was.

1048
01:02:00,100 --> 01:02:05,100
I was in the sense that there were so 
many ways that the court could have gone

1049
01:02:05,141 --> 01:02:07,240
wrong,
have so many issues.

1050
01:02:07,370 --> 01:02:12,250
They said that it was not the best thing
they could do was to be very narrow.

1051
01:02:12,251 --> 01:02:13,084
And I actually,
if I were writing of the brief in the 

1052
01:02:14,531 --> 01:02:16,090
case,
that's what I would do too,

1053
01:02:16,120 --> 01:02:18,820
because all of these principles are so 
important.

1054
01:02:18,821 --> 01:02:21,710
I deeply care about freedom of 
expression,

1055
01:02:21,730 --> 01:02:25,650
including the freedom not to be 
compelled to affirm a message that,

1056
01:02:25,651 --> 01:02:26,484
that violates your beliefs,
whether they're religious or 

1057
01:02:29,161 --> 01:02:30,660
conscientious,
doesn't matter.

1058
01:02:31,070 --> 01:02:34,650
Um,
but I also deeply believe in equality in

1059
01:02:34,651 --> 01:02:37,740
the public sphere and the facts were 
murky.

1060
01:02:37,741 --> 01:02:38,550
So I think,
you know,

1061
01:02:38,550 --> 01:02:43,550
as I think what happened in past 
situations with race and gender,

1062
01:02:45,870 --> 01:02:47,070
I think,
you know,

1063
01:02:47,071 --> 01:02:47,904
once things,
once the immediate resistance died down 

1064
01:02:52,051 --> 01:02:52,884
to the 1964 civil rights act,
that it sort of worked its way out in a 

1065
01:03:00,151 --> 01:03:05,151
way that is maximally respective 
respectful of all the competing.

1066
01:03:05,820 --> 01:03:06,653
Right.
So I think it's very good to avoid 

1067
01:03:08,941 --> 01:03:09,774
really broad brush holdings that might 
have unanticipated adverse consequences 

1068
01:03:14,401 --> 01:03:17,700
for other factual situations.
But that's an interesting take because I

1069
01:03:17,701 --> 01:03:18,534
saw some people saying,
well they're just sort of kicking this 

1070
01:03:20,281 --> 01:03:21,114
down the road now.
But basically you're saying in a weird 

1071
01:03:23,431 --> 01:03:28,200
way that's the way a functional society 
works at times.

1072
01:03:28,500 --> 01:03:29,161
I think,
you know,

1073
01:03:29,161 --> 01:03:33,000
the court sets them general goal posts 
and then as time goes by,

1074
01:03:33,001 --> 01:03:33,834
the controversy may die down.
People may figure out how they can live 

1075
01:03:38,251 --> 01:03:41,730
their own lives in ways that they're not
going to be bothered by,

1076
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:44,790
by the government not being treated 
disrespectfully.

1077
01:03:44,970 --> 01:03:49,590
One of the things that I really liked 
about the opinion in that case,

1078
01:03:49,591 --> 01:03:50,371
and,
uh,

1079
01:03:50,371 --> 01:03:54,720
it's so contrasting to what's happening 
in the european countries that I discuss

1080
01:03:54,721 --> 01:03:55,554
in my book is that the court talked very
strongly about equality and neutrality 

1081
01:04:02,550 --> 01:04:05,100
in many different,
sorry,

1082
01:04:07,860 --> 01:04:09,780
in many different contexts.

1083
01:04:09,780 --> 01:04:14,780
So not only that you should be treated 
with equal dignity regardless of who you

1084
01:04:16,770 --> 01:04:21,210
are,
but also regardless of what you believe.

1085
01:04:21,480 --> 01:04:23,550
So the fact that the court was 
respectful,

1086
01:04:23,551 --> 01:04:24,384
both of the equal dignity of the gay 
couple and have the equal dignity of 

1087
01:04:30,751 --> 01:04:34,200
their religious beliefs and the free 
speech rights of the baker.

1088
01:04:34,470 --> 01:04:37,020
I really liked that.
Um,

1089
01:04:37,021 --> 01:04:40,470
one of the things that bothers me very 
much about what a,

1090
01:04:40,471 --> 01:04:45,471
is often paraded as diversity on campus 
is that it only looks at one dimension.

1091
01:04:46,360 --> 01:04:50,070
It looks at demographic diversity in 
terms of who you are,

1092
01:04:50,071 --> 01:04:52,680
but not in terms of,
of what you believe.

1093
01:04:52,950 --> 01:04:56,430
And in these european countries that are
enforcing hate speech laws,

1094
01:04:56,490 --> 01:05:00,150
you see them going both ways depending 
on who's in power.

1095
01:05:00,450 --> 01:05:05,450
So certain religious beliefs are being 
punished and criminalized as hate speech

1096
01:05:06,061 --> 01:05:11,061
If they run against what is a dominant 
secular orthodoxy in those societies.

1097
01:05:11,560 --> 01:05:14,370
Uh,
whereas in other communities,

1098
01:05:14,630 --> 01:05:15,463
a certain criticism of religion is 
treated as hate speech and criminalized 

1099
01:05:19,691 --> 01:05:24,670
when it's the religious belief that is 
held by those in dominant power.

1100
01:05:25,240 --> 01:05:28,030
I think the main takeaway here is that 
freedom is messy,

1101
01:05:28,031 --> 01:05:30,490
but we're doing a pretty decent job of 
it here.

1102
01:05:30,520 --> 01:05:33,130
Well,
thanks to those who keep agitating,

1103
01:05:33,131 --> 01:05:35,190
right?
Eternal vigilance go well.

1104
01:05:35,250 --> 01:05:38,270
It's been a pleasure chatting with you 
and for more on a dean,

1105
01:05:38,530 --> 01:05:43,240
check out her new book hate why we 
should resist it with free speech,

1106
01:05:43,450 --> 01:05:45,550
not censorship,
and we're going to link to it right down

1107
01:05:45,551 --> 01:05:46,384
below.
