1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:00,983
I'm not sure if you heard about this,
but the 2016 election was completely 

2
00:00:03,661 --> 00:00:06,390
been at as trump and hillary were 
actually the only part of it,

3
00:00:06,391 --> 00:00:10,440
as there were other characters from 
Bernie and Jeb to Marco and Ted.

4
00:00:10,890 --> 00:00:11,723
The election also caused the implosion 
of the mainstream media and set us on a 

5
00:00:14,761 --> 00:00:19,761
path that has hashtag Maga racing 
towards hashtag resistance with the rest

6
00:00:20,551 --> 00:00:25,080
of us caught right in the middle,
Ohio governor John Casick was one of the

7
00:00:25,081 --> 00:00:29,070
more moderate voices in a campaign 
season that we're short on moderation.

8
00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:32,640
As a fiscally conservative,
socially liberal Republican.

9
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:35,730
I see casick as someone who has some of 
the right ideas,

10
00:00:35,731 --> 00:00:40,530
but who's timing just wasn't right for 
the madness of 2016 cases.

11
00:00:40,590 --> 00:00:44,070
Team reached out to us a couple days ago
and we have him in studio today,

12
00:00:44,071 --> 00:00:44,904
totally unscripted and unedited with no 
advanced knowledge of the topics or 

13
00:00:48,811 --> 00:00:49,644
questions.
I think this is exactly the way we need 

14
00:00:51,571 --> 00:00:55,890
to be hearing from our politicians and I
hope that this interview helps dls in on

15
00:00:55,891 --> 00:00:58,080
these conversations in the near future.

16
00:01:03,330 --> 00:01:05,400
Joining me today is the author of the 
new book,

17
00:01:05,401 --> 00:01:08,190
two pads,
America divided or united,

18
00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:10,350
a former Republican presidential 
candidate,

19
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:12,870
and the current governor of the great 
state of Ohio,

20
00:01:12,871 --> 00:01:14,880
Governor John Casick.
Welcome to the Rubin report.

21
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:17,840
Gets a really good television voice.
How is that?

22
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:19,470
Well,
we were just sitting here.

23
00:01:19,471 --> 00:01:20,990
You were kind of normal and they were 
like,

24
00:01:21,340 --> 00:01:22,173
dude,
you know,

25
00:01:22,350 --> 00:01:24,030
it was like Ted Baxter.
Very good.

26
00:01:24,090 --> 00:01:25,050
Ah,
Ted Baxter.

27
00:01:25,051 --> 00:01:26,980
I like the reference that did not go 
over me.

28
00:01:27,110 --> 00:01:27,520
Well,
you know,

29
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:29,510
I liked.
Of course everybody else watching,

30
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:31,440
they don't know who he is,
but that's okay.

31
00:01:31,441 --> 00:01:32,274
They could google it.
Some of my millennial people won't get 

32
00:01:34,171 --> 00:01:35,004
it,
but they should google who ted Baxter 

33
00:01:35,821 --> 00:01:36,390
is,
that would,

34
00:01:36,390 --> 00:01:38,010
that would be good for them.
So,

35
00:01:38,011 --> 00:01:39,930
uh,
first one I wanted to start with you.

36
00:01:39,931 --> 00:01:43,290
I'm incredibly excited you're here.
And it's interesting because your people

37
00:01:43,291 --> 00:01:45,480
reached out to us about four days ago.

38
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:49,140
They said the governor would like to 
come in and then we quickly set this up.

39
00:01:49,470 --> 00:01:50,370
Nobody said,
oh,

40
00:01:50,371 --> 00:01:52,950
we have to talk about this or we can't 
talk about this.

41
00:01:53,130 --> 00:01:53,963
You sat down here about two minutes ago 
and you said whatever you want to do is 

42
00:01:57,151 --> 00:01:57,984
fine,
and I feel like that is partly what's 

43
00:01:59,851 --> 00:02:02,750
lost in politics right now,
that we're going to just do this.

44
00:02:02,930 --> 00:02:05,700
It's not just lost in politics.
I see it lost in a lot of things.

45
00:02:06,330 --> 00:02:09,570
You know,
I met with this big car company and like

46
00:02:09,571 --> 00:02:10,404
they had these guys come in to see me 
and it was like they were totally 

47
00:02:12,661 --> 00:02:15,320
scripted and uh,
you know,

48
00:02:15,330 --> 00:02:16,163
so I think,
you know,

49
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:18,230
life is having fun.
Life is,

50
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:21,450
you know,
being able to be real.

51
00:02:21,570 --> 00:02:26,570
And the reason why we wanted to do this 
is I actually kind of saw part of one of

52
00:02:27,391 --> 00:02:32,160
your shows and this media is a really 
amazing.

53
00:02:32,610 --> 00:02:33,443
A lot of people don't get it and I'm 
starting to get it and I have some 

54
00:02:36,961 --> 00:02:41,130
people around me who say this is really 
a way to keep your voice out there.

55
00:02:41,131 --> 00:02:41,964
You know,
that's what I want to be able to have a 

56
00:02:42,781 --> 00:02:45,960
constructive positive voice to help our 
country.

57
00:02:46,470 --> 00:02:51,470
And this is another avenue that I'm glad
no one else has found it yet.

58
00:02:51,890 --> 00:02:56,400
In my profession,
so we can be a first mover,

59
00:02:56,401 --> 00:02:57,510
which I,
I really,

60
00:02:57,540 --> 00:02:58,373
I really like and I liked the fact that 
we can actually have a conversation 

61
00:03:02,530 --> 00:03:03,363
longer than just a couple soundbites.
Do you ever worry that because we've 

62
00:03:07,451 --> 00:03:08,284
lost the ability to do this,
that the soundbite world is what's 

63
00:03:11,201 --> 00:03:12,530
causing so many of the problems?
Well,

64
00:03:12,590 --> 00:03:14,500
that was what happened in the campaign.
It was all,

65
00:03:14,501 --> 00:03:15,334
you know,
we didn't do it but these other 

66
00:03:16,271 --> 00:03:20,020
campaigns and I had advice from some 
people who had run before,

67
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:21,153
make sure you get your little thing out 
there so you can blow up the television 

68
00:03:26,530 --> 00:03:30,010
morning news and you know,
and it's like tricks,

69
00:03:30,011 --> 00:03:32,110
you know,
that's not a good thing.

70
00:03:32,110 --> 00:03:34,360
And I look,
people I saw,

71
00:03:34,570 --> 00:03:36,490
I saw a thing on a sign yesterday had 
said,

72
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:37,720
email me,
please,

73
00:03:37,721 --> 00:03:40,170
we have to talk.
Yeah,

74
00:03:40,210 --> 00:03:42,580
I think the.
Look I,

75
00:03:43,650 --> 00:03:45,370
I didn't have a smartphone for a long 
time.

76
00:03:45,371 --> 00:03:46,204
I have,
I've had an ipad and I got to the very 

77
00:03:47,861 --> 00:03:48,694
beginning,
but I didn't have a smartphone and 

78
00:03:51,730 --> 00:03:52,563
people would laugh at me,
but I didn't need this stuff during the 

79
00:03:55,210 --> 00:03:55,450
day,
you know,

80
00:03:55,450 --> 00:03:56,283
I didn't need to have basketball scores 
or look at the weather 25 times or some 

81
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:02,390
kind of headline in the news,
uh,

82
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:07,500
or my emails because I have people that 
can tell me if there's a crisis.

83
00:04:07,601 --> 00:04:08,231
They tell me,
I go,

84
00:04:08,231 --> 00:04:09,550
okay,
well let's see what it is.

85
00:04:10,090 --> 00:04:13,090
Um,
but I got my smartphone and now the best

86
00:04:13,091 --> 00:04:17,740
thing about it is that I can text,
but I find that I text,

87
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:20,560
you know,
what it does is it creates a laziness,

88
00:04:21,100 --> 00:04:21,550
right?

89
00:04:21,550 --> 00:04:24,430
You don't have to go through a 
conversation now,

90
00:04:24,431 --> 00:04:25,300
don't you think?
Look,

91
00:04:25,340 --> 00:04:27,700
you have a,
you have a show here where people talk.

92
00:04:27,950 --> 00:04:30,610
What do you think about it?
Don't you think this is a problem?

93
00:04:30,700 --> 00:04:31,533
I mean,
I think that resetting our ability to 

94
00:04:34,031 --> 00:04:34,864
talk and actually think and sit across 
from somebody and make some eye contact 

95
00:04:38,651 --> 00:04:40,870
and really try to understand what they 
think.

96
00:04:40,871 --> 00:04:41,704
I think that is almost the most 
important thing that we'd given up and 

97
00:04:44,861 --> 00:04:45,694
these last couple of years,
it was the tradeoff between all these 

98
00:04:47,171 --> 00:04:49,820
devices and the immediate,
uh,

99
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:53,010
response.
So what do we do about this?

100
00:04:53,220 --> 00:04:53,830
I mean,
I,

101
00:04:53,830 --> 00:04:54,663
I honestly think that you come in here 
right now and your people being brave 

102
00:04:57,371 --> 00:04:58,210
enough to say,
yeah,

103
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:00,720
it's not like I have people,
you know,

104
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:04,210
these are people that work around,
kind of support me and help me.

105
00:05:04,210 --> 00:05:07,750
They're friends and,
but this whole,

106
00:05:07,870 --> 00:05:08,740
you know,
sort of funny.

107
00:05:08,741 --> 00:05:09,574
We were,
you go on these shows on regular 

108
00:05:12,191 --> 00:05:14,980
television which I think are really 
important and you get,

109
00:05:15,010 --> 00:05:16,630
you know,
2 million people to see you.

110
00:05:17,380 --> 00:05:19,780
But if you were like hanging out with 
Logan,

111
00:05:19,781 --> 00:05:23,030
Paul got 16 million subscribers.
It's like,

112
00:05:23,620 --> 00:05:24,453
and you know,
the funny thing about it is that people 

113
00:05:27,041 --> 00:05:27,874
can't see it really now,
but that's not really true because I 

114
00:05:30,341 --> 00:05:34,510
think probably you're in demand now and 
you can go out and make talks and people

115
00:05:34,511 --> 00:05:36,780
show up to see you.
Um,

116
00:05:36,850 --> 00:05:37,683
but it's kind of an invisible world to 
those who were kind of hooked on 

117
00:05:41,110 --> 00:05:42,220
television,
right?

118
00:05:42,230 --> 00:05:43,840
You under stand.
What I mean by that?

119
00:05:43,841 --> 00:05:44,590
I do.
So how do we,

120
00:05:44,590 --> 00:05:45,790
how do we bridge that?
I don't know,

121
00:05:45,791 --> 00:05:47,350
but I gave you,
you know,

122
00:05:47,420 --> 00:05:51,880
what's I think it's called what's news?
It was really fantastic and there were a

123
00:05:51,881 --> 00:05:54,250
couple of million views and,
and I liked it.

124
00:05:54,350 --> 00:05:56,590
Um,
you just have to keep doing it.

125
00:05:56,591 --> 00:05:58,250
It's part of why I wanted to be here.
I mean,

126
00:05:58,251 --> 00:05:59,360
look,
I pull up here,

127
00:05:59,361 --> 00:06:02,270
you got a studio in your garage.
Um,

128
00:06:03,230 --> 00:06:04,280
it's,
it's cool.

129
00:06:04,281 --> 00:06:07,750
It's neat and you don't,
you don't have to go very far.

130
00:06:08,770 --> 00:06:09,603
My Commute's about 10 minutes,
but the hard thing is got to be getting 

131
00:06:12,681 --> 00:06:13,514
compelling.
Guess that's got to be a hard thing to 

132
00:06:15,411 --> 00:06:16,910
do.
How do you go about doing that?

133
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:19,610
Well,
unfortunately a lot of people are coming

134
00:06:19,611 --> 00:06:22,640
to this medium now and a lot of the 
guests that you asked me right before we

135
00:06:22,641 --> 00:06:24,170
started all these books here,
I mean most of the,

136
00:06:24,171 --> 00:06:26,990
I think virtually every single one 
except the Carl Sagan book.

137
00:06:26,991 --> 00:06:28,460
Are there any of them that are 
interesting,

138
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:30,830
boring,
and I don't know.

139
00:06:30,831 --> 00:06:31,664
There's some great books there by,
by many of my guests from Steven pinker 

140
00:06:34,641 --> 00:06:37,720
and Sam Harris and Scott Adams,
and plenty of ice.

141
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:39,550
You have one here on John Adams,
so that's good.

142
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:41,480
We did a president's week a couple weeks
ago.

143
00:06:41,481 --> 00:06:42,740
John Adams.
So you're getting,

144
00:06:42,741 --> 00:06:44,600
you're getting good.
People of color were getting,

145
00:06:45,050 --> 00:06:46,610
was it,
you know what,

146
00:06:46,611 --> 00:06:51,611
a lot of times when I am with press,
I'm actually curious about them and they

147
00:06:51,801 --> 00:06:53,570
don't like it when I'm asking them 
stuff.

148
00:06:53,630 --> 00:06:54,760
Okay.
It must've,

149
00:06:55,050 --> 00:06:57,260
it must've been hard in the beginning,
right?

150
00:06:58,250 --> 00:06:59,530
It's hard to build anything.
I mean,

151
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:00,261
you know,
that.

152
00:07:00,261 --> 00:07:01,094
But I.
One of the things that I consistently 

153
00:07:02,330 --> 00:07:05,090
tell my audience is it's cool that a lot
of the beliefs that I have,

154
00:07:05,330 --> 00:07:05,691
I,
you know,

155
00:07:05,691 --> 00:07:08,900
I fall a little more within classical 
liberalism and libertarianism,

156
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:09,913
a lot of the beliefs about doing things 
for yourself and I've built this 

157
00:07:12,261 --> 00:07:15,500
business with the same ideas that I try 
to talk about here.

158
00:07:15,740 --> 00:07:17,510
Uh,
some of which I think we're going to get

159
00:07:17,511 --> 00:07:18,344
to.
And it's kind of a beautiful thing if I 

160
00:07:19,380 --> 00:07:19,790
keep.

161
00:07:19,790 --> 00:07:21,170
Not,
not if you keep going.

162
00:07:21,550 --> 00:07:22,383
All right.
Let me ask you a couple of questions as 

163
00:07:23,391 --> 00:07:24,224
long as you're here.
So I thought just first I thought we 

164
00:07:25,550 --> 00:07:28,400
them just a little bit about growing up.
What kind of family you grew up in.

165
00:07:28,401 --> 00:07:30,500
I feel like people never do that in 
politics anymore.

166
00:07:30,620 --> 00:07:31,453
We go to immediately mocks me because I 
say my father was a mailman and so the 

167
00:07:35,090 --> 00:07:37,820
people write that in there,
like cynical and all that.

168
00:07:37,821 --> 00:07:41,120
But I grew up in a towel and it was 
over.

169
00:07:41,270 --> 00:07:43,520
I mean,
I don't think I ever met a Republican.

170
00:07:43,580 --> 00:07:47,120
Not In my town.
My uncle Harry was a republican.

171
00:07:47,121 --> 00:07:50,990
They say we didn't listen much to him.
He's a great guy,

172
00:07:50,991 --> 00:07:54,240
but you know,
it was blue collar and you know,

173
00:07:54,270 --> 00:07:57,570
was sort of the,
some of these people you would define is

174
00:07:57,590 --> 00:08:00,500
Kinda the trump people you know,
who felt they had been left behind.

175
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:02,150
So,
you know,

176
00:08:02,151 --> 00:08:06,080
as a result of that,
I guess that's why I'm a populist,

177
00:08:06,081 --> 00:08:09,530
but a positive populace,
not a negative populist positive that we

178
00:08:09,531 --> 00:08:12,830
can do what we can together we can,
we can rise.

179
00:08:12,890 --> 00:08:13,723
And,
um,

180
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:18,230
that's a great place to come from 
because you really have a sense,

181
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:20,210
you have a sense of people,
you know,

182
00:08:20,211 --> 00:08:23,450
and it's not just the upper crust,
uh,

183
00:08:23,750 --> 00:08:24,583
we respected the upper crust.
I can remember saying to my father one 

184
00:08:26,991 --> 00:08:28,430
time,
Daddy,

185
00:08:28,431 --> 00:08:29,810
what about the rich?
He said,

186
00:08:29,811 --> 00:08:31,430
well,
we don't hate the rich.

187
00:08:31,431 --> 00:08:33,200
We want to be the rich,
you know.

188
00:08:33,740 --> 00:08:37,640
And so it was great God fearing 
conservative Democrat,

189
00:08:37,670 --> 00:08:39,840
good values.
Faith was a,

190
00:08:40,380 --> 00:08:41,213
was a part of my early childhood,
which I normally drifted away from when 

191
00:08:44,721 --> 00:08:45,830
I went to college,
you know,

192
00:08:46,220 --> 00:08:47,630
so like Augustine,
he says,

193
00:08:47,631 --> 00:08:48,440
you know,
I need to,

194
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:51,140
I know I need to be committed to God,
but just not right now.

195
00:08:51,140 --> 00:08:53,450
I have a couple of parties to go to.
So,

196
00:08:53,470 --> 00:08:54,303
you know,
we all drifted away and I've not 

197
00:08:55,681 --> 00:08:57,690
drifted.
I've come roaring back into that.

198
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:01,020
But common sense,
right?

199
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:02,473
A freewheeling,
sometimes it puts people off a little 

200
00:09:05,821 --> 00:09:08,610
bit the way I am because I'm pretty 
direct.

201
00:09:08,670 --> 00:09:09,503
And,
but the other thing is I was telling 

202
00:09:10,951 --> 00:09:15,060
somebody the other day that,
you know,

203
00:09:15,061 --> 00:09:18,660
I don't want people to be confused about
my positions on anything.

204
00:09:19,050 --> 00:09:20,430
And so if somebody says,
well,

205
00:09:20,431 --> 00:09:22,410
I think it's blue,
and I might say,

206
00:09:22,411 --> 00:09:23,580
well no,
I think it's red.

207
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:26,880
And they,
most people would expect me to say,

208
00:09:26,881 --> 00:09:28,200
okay,
well I'll consider that.

209
00:09:28,260 --> 00:09:28,980
And I'm like,
no,

210
00:09:28,980 --> 00:09:30,060
no,
I just don't think that.

211
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:33,600
And I think to some degree people don't 
get it.

212
00:09:33,660 --> 00:09:36,870
So it takes a little bit of time for 
people to come to understand me.

213
00:09:36,970 --> 00:09:37,621
Yeah.
All right,

214
00:09:37,621 --> 00:09:39,190
well that's what we're going to do here 
for now.

215
00:09:39,530 --> 00:09:41,640
So you mentioned a couple of interesting
things there.

216
00:09:41,641 --> 00:09:42,474
So you didn't grow up in a Republican 
family and you just used the phrase 

217
00:09:44,671 --> 00:09:45,504
conservative Democrat.
So one of the things I talk a lot about 

218
00:09:47,911 --> 00:09:48,744
here is that it seems to me before we 
get into your party that the 

219
00:09:51,421 --> 00:09:52,254
conservative Democrat or the blue dog,
democrat or sort of the moderate 

220
00:09:55,111 --> 00:09:55,944
Democrat,
a lot of them were buddies of mine in 

221
00:09:57,121 --> 00:09:58,590
Congress,
great friends.

222
00:09:58,591 --> 00:10:01,380
Do they really exist anymore?
I think this is,

223
00:10:01,410 --> 00:10:06,330
I think this young man in Pennsylvania 
is blue dog Democrat from what I can see

224
00:10:07,020 --> 00:10:08,610
now.
He got elected at 33,

225
00:10:08,611 --> 00:10:12,060
I think I was 30.
So he's kind of an old timer.

226
00:10:12,090 --> 00:10:13,110
Yeah.
But no,

227
00:10:13,111 --> 00:10:16,950
I think that um,
I think in both parties it's really hard

228
00:10:16,951 --> 00:10:17,784
if you're a republican,
you got a fear of the right and if 

229
00:10:19,231 --> 00:10:22,050
you're a Democrat you fear the left and 
it just pulls everybody apart.

230
00:10:22,270 --> 00:10:23,280
You know that though.
But,

231
00:10:23,281 --> 00:10:24,114
but you've managed to kind of work 
through something that's sort of 

232
00:10:27,780 --> 00:10:28,613
centrist,
right?

233
00:10:28,710 --> 00:10:30,690
Somehow.
Well,

234
00:10:30,691 --> 00:10:32,340
I don't know what that means.
You know,

235
00:10:32,370 --> 00:10:35,520
one guy once told me,
the only thing that goes down the middle

236
00:10:35,521 --> 00:10:37,920
of a road are yellow lines and dead 
skunks.

237
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:38,620
Okay.
And,

238
00:10:38,620 --> 00:10:39,960
um,
I'm not a,

239
00:10:39,990 --> 00:10:42,330
but I'm a common sense person.
Well,

240
00:10:42,331 --> 00:10:46,020
I guess I look,
I look at an issue and say,

241
00:10:46,021 --> 00:10:47,700
okay,
what do we do about it?

242
00:10:47,701 --> 00:10:49,920
And we look at a problem.
How do we fix the problem?

243
00:10:50,670 --> 00:10:53,670
But I'm not really going to have an 
ideological.

244
00:10:53,830 --> 00:10:56,610
I'm forced.
It's kept pulling me back.

245
00:10:56,611 --> 00:10:57,444
But the same time being a conservative,
I want to see what the solutions are 

246
00:11:02,011 --> 00:11:04,680
without having to bring bureaucracy or 
government in.

247
00:11:04,940 --> 00:11:05,773
And I'll tell you why that is.
It's because government inherently a is 

248
00:11:10,220 --> 00:11:11,053
so subject to political considerations 
that people have a hard time make 

249
00:11:16,860 --> 00:11:18,570
calling a spade a spade.

250
00:11:18,690 --> 00:11:19,550
It's like,
no,

251
00:11:19,551 --> 00:11:20,384
no,
I got all these pressures and I don't 

252
00:11:21,871 --> 00:11:25,890
like that.
And so when you go to government you can

253
00:11:25,891 --> 00:11:27,840
get trapped,
but you get trapped with big business to

254
00:11:27,841 --> 00:11:28,531
big business.
You know,

255
00:11:28,531 --> 00:11:30,930
you try to like,
I need this prescription,

256
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:32,640
you know,
and somebody out here is telling me,

257
00:11:32,641 --> 00:11:33,451
oh no,
no,

258
00:11:33,451 --> 00:11:34,530
it costs too much,
you know,

259
00:11:35,010 --> 00:11:37,320
big things like that all have always 
bothered me,

260
00:11:37,350 --> 00:11:38,640
you know,
big institutions,

261
00:11:38,641 --> 00:11:40,280
whether it's government.
Uh,

262
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:41,610
uh,
I grew up,

263
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:43,710
my dad was in a union,
I always like unions,

264
00:11:43,711 --> 00:11:44,544
but you know,
the problem with the unions is when the 

265
00:11:45,541 --> 00:11:50,541
union boss not representing the worker,
and I'm so big,

266
00:11:50,581 --> 00:11:52,530
institutions don't throw me,
where am I?

267
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:56,590
Kind of unpredictable because you kind 
of labeled yourself a little bit ago.

268
00:11:56,710 --> 00:11:58,090
You said,
well I'm this and that.

269
00:11:58,091 --> 00:12:00,190
If you asked me what I am,
I'll say I'm a conservative,

270
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:01,420
but then you will say,
well,

271
00:12:01,421 --> 00:12:02,830
but why do you think this or that?

272
00:12:03,340 --> 00:12:04,173
And uh,
because I don't think we need to be 

273
00:12:05,771 --> 00:12:06,604
stuck right there.
Being stuck in life is really 

274
00:12:09,370 --> 00:12:10,870
depressing.
All right,

275
00:12:10,871 --> 00:12:11,704
so tell me about what does being a 
conservative basically mean to you then 

276
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:16,271
if they.
Again,

277
00:12:16,271 --> 00:12:18,640
government is government as a last 
resort,

278
00:12:18,910 --> 00:12:20,770
not as a first resort,
but,

279
00:12:21,220 --> 00:12:23,500
but I also don't think it's like no 
government,

280
00:12:23,590 --> 00:12:24,423
you know,
how do you decide where that you use 

281
00:12:26,550 --> 00:12:27,383
your judgment and you list,
you have good people around and you 

282
00:12:29,711 --> 00:12:34,711
think about things and we're trying to 
price something right now in our state.

283
00:12:35,381 --> 00:12:38,650
Somebody wants access to stuff in our 
state.

284
00:12:38,770 --> 00:12:40,600
Okay.
It would,

285
00:12:40,630 --> 00:12:43,420
it's a good thing.
It's a good thing what they want,

286
00:12:43,990 --> 00:12:46,690
but I don't know what the price of the 
value of it is.

287
00:12:46,691 --> 00:12:50,440
Okay.
So I can't just look at what governments

288
00:12:50,441 --> 00:12:53,470
have done to determine the value because
I don't have.

289
00:12:53,740 --> 00:12:55,360
No,
I don't have a whole lot of.

290
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:58,470
I don't invest a lot in that.
Uh,

291
00:12:59,290 --> 00:13:02,320
I want to go out and talk to a variety 
of people in business to say,

292
00:13:02,321 --> 00:13:04,690
what do you think this is worth?
Okay.

293
00:13:05,140 --> 00:13:08,020
And um,
so how do I do that?

294
00:13:08,330 --> 00:13:11,740
People that come in and they talk and 
they argue for certain things,

295
00:13:11,741 --> 00:13:16,690
but at the end I have to decide.
So I just use good judgment as I can.

296
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:18,153
Do you have a certain leeway when it 
comes to sort of thinking for yourself 

297
00:13:21,701 --> 00:13:22,534
as a governor that may be the senators 
and the congressmen can't have because 

298
00:13:25,811 --> 00:13:27,970
they have to all,
not that you don't have to come together

299
00:13:27,971 --> 00:13:30,220
and work with people.
You have to have to do it from,

300
00:13:30,221 --> 00:13:34,090
with people outside of their state with 
massively competing interests and things

301
00:13:34,091 --> 00:13:34,924
like that.
I was offering budgets against 

302
00:13:36,911 --> 00:13:38,110
Republican presidents.

303
00:13:38,910 --> 00:13:40,180
I mean,
just do your job.

304
00:13:40,181 --> 00:13:41,710
I mean,
why would you want to be.

305
00:13:41,980 --> 00:13:45,250
Why would you want to have a television 
show where you don't make it real?

306
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:49,540
Why would I want to be in politics no 
matter where I am and not make it real?

307
00:13:49,660 --> 00:13:51,160
I mean,
what would I be there for?

308
00:13:51,340 --> 00:13:53,590
It's really stupid,
right?

309
00:13:53,740 --> 00:13:54,573
I mean,
there's a lot of people there I don't 

310
00:13:58,751 --> 00:14:01,450
want to be,
I don't want to be casting aspersions or

311
00:14:01,451 --> 00:14:05,290
judging them only for me.
Why would you do that?

312
00:14:05,650 --> 00:14:06,483
I mean,
so we had a decision on Medicaid 

313
00:14:08,081 --> 00:14:08,980
expansion,
right?

314
00:14:09,070 --> 00:14:10,670
In Ohio,
you know that,

315
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:12,000
you know,
that Medicaid expansion,

316
00:14:12,020 --> 00:14:12,853
of course,
right?

317
00:14:13,180 --> 00:14:17,200
So I just really.
Jan Brewer and Arizona did it,

318
00:14:17,201 --> 00:14:21,820
which really was kind of shocking to me,
but I was really the first big state,

319
00:14:21,821 --> 00:14:25,330
big Republican governor who expand it.
Was it hard?

320
00:14:26,260 --> 00:14:27,250
Was a piece of cake.

321
00:14:27,550 --> 00:14:28,383
If I'm going to get money that's not 
going to put me in a straight jacket 

322
00:14:30,881 --> 00:14:35,080
from the federal government.
If I can use that money to heal,

323
00:14:35,110 --> 00:14:35,943
to help heal or help help to help the 
mentally ill so they're not sleeping 

324
00:14:40,961 --> 00:14:41,794
under a bridge or living in a jail.
Or if I can help people who have drug 

325
00:14:45,941 --> 00:14:47,770
addiction to get treatment and get off 
of it,

326
00:14:48,250 --> 00:14:53,250
if I can have a lower uninsurance rate,
why wouldn't I do that?

327
00:14:53,890 --> 00:14:56,750
And because people are going to yell at 
me and fight with,

328
00:14:56,810 --> 00:14:59,030
so what?
Who Cares?

329
00:14:59,150 --> 00:15:00,890
I mean I care.
I don't want them to not,

330
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:02,780
I don't want them to be anxious.
In fact,

331
00:15:02,781 --> 00:15:03,614
in my state of the state address I was,
I made a talk that really had almost 

332
00:15:06,351 --> 00:15:07,184
nothing to do with policy.
It'll had all to do with basically 

333
00:15:09,141 --> 00:15:10,760
philosophy and the meaning of life.

334
00:15:11,210 --> 00:15:12,043
They say it was the only state of the 
state speech delivered by a governor in 

335
00:15:14,211 --> 00:15:16,820
the history of the world where the name 
Cammo was discussed.

336
00:15:17,590 --> 00:15:19,040
But I,
I,

337
00:15:19,041 --> 00:15:19,874
um,
and I didn't mention that because I 

338
00:15:20,511 --> 00:15:24,140
don't want to jab anybody in the eye,
but the decision to do that,

339
00:15:24,890 --> 00:15:26,630
to help people,
it's just,

340
00:15:26,780 --> 00:15:27,613
it's such an easy decision.
Do you find you have a little bit of 

341
00:15:30,050 --> 00:15:30,883
extra freedom right now because you 
can't run for reelection and Ohio now 

342
00:15:34,401 --> 00:15:36,890
there's a lot of talk at 2020,
which I want to end the interview.

343
00:15:36,891 --> 00:15:37,724
Oh look,
I mean,

344
00:15:37,730 --> 00:15:42,500
I'm probably so,
but I've always been very independent.

345
00:15:43,130 --> 00:15:45,080
You know,
I was a military reformer.

346
00:15:46,370 --> 00:15:51,020
I was offering my own budgets against 
President Bush.

347
00:15:52,140 --> 00:15:52,973
I took on corporate welfare reform,
couldn't find a Democrat with a search 

348
00:15:57,561 --> 00:15:59,450
light.
And the Republicans ran the other way.

349
00:15:59,910 --> 00:16:01,570
Um,
no,

350
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:04,040
I,
I've always pretty well felt that,

351
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:08,490
you know,
you gotta do what you have to do and uh,

352
00:16:08,950 --> 00:16:11,660
and my more free now and maybe a little 
bit but,

353
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:12,860
but I,
I,

354
00:16:12,860 --> 00:16:14,090
nothing would change.

355
00:16:14,150 --> 00:16:14,721
I mean,
I don't know,

356
00:16:14,721 --> 00:16:17,030
what is it I would reverse,
I wouldn't say,

357
00:16:17,031 --> 00:16:17,864
well,
we're not going to do this medicaid 

358
00:16:18,651 --> 00:16:23,120
thing now if it got us into point where 
we were fiscally at risk,

359
00:16:23,121 --> 00:16:25,190
I would have to stop it.
I've told everybody that,

360
00:16:25,580 --> 00:16:27,260
but no,
I don't really think so.

361
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:30,310
But I am having probably more fun now.
You know,

362
00:16:30,410 --> 00:16:31,243
having a lot of fun.
I mean I can tell that I've been having 

363
00:16:33,231 --> 00:16:34,011
fun.
You know,

364
00:16:34,011 --> 00:16:34,844
I ran for reelection and I,
and I never even used the word Obama 

365
00:16:38,780 --> 00:16:40,700
running for reelection.
Never talked about it.

366
00:16:40,701 --> 00:16:44,000
I just talked about our record and it 
was fun and it was positive.

367
00:16:44,750 --> 00:16:45,770
Look,
here's the thing,

368
00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:47,353
and we all need to know this.
We all need to be healers in one way or 

369
00:16:51,861 --> 00:16:52,694
another.
We need to heal our family and our 

370
00:16:55,821 --> 00:17:00,200
friends and strangers.
I'm not that great a guy.

371
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:01,033
Okay.
But I know that that makes sense and I 

372
00:17:02,301 --> 00:17:07,040
know that it's right.
So it's just a cool thing to think about

373
00:17:07,041 --> 00:17:10,370
and that's why politics is so boring to 
me because it's all these,

374
00:17:10,371 --> 00:17:12,410
all these calculations and all this 
crap.

375
00:17:12,650 --> 00:17:13,483
Why don't we just do a job?
Let's think about how to pull to pull 

376
00:17:16,071 --> 00:17:16,904
the country together.
Let's make sure that we can help people 

377
00:17:18,561 --> 00:17:21,110
to be lifted.
Let's not tear somebody down.

378
00:17:21,111 --> 00:17:24,080
Elizabeth Warren wants to tear down all 
these rich people.

379
00:17:24,081 --> 00:17:25,790
I don't know why,
or Bernie or whatever.

380
00:17:25,791 --> 00:17:28,040
I used to work with Bernie.
It's,

381
00:17:28,130 --> 00:17:31,930
you don't need to tear people down.
We need to just build people up and,

382
00:17:32,020 --> 00:17:33,940
and put them together.
Yeah.

383
00:17:34,010 --> 00:17:37,010
Did you ever get into any of those 
philosophical discussions with Bernie?

384
00:17:37,011 --> 00:17:40,640
Because the class war thing I see,
I see as extremely dangerous.

385
00:17:40,790 --> 00:17:41,623
No,
I don't have a conversation with Bernie 

386
00:17:43,611 --> 00:17:45,530
had been burning and I,
we're in a house together.

387
00:17:45,530 --> 00:17:46,610
He was,
you know,

388
00:17:46,670 --> 00:17:50,250
really kind of in another orbit.
We all thought he was.

389
00:17:50,310 --> 00:17:51,001
And yet,
you know,

390
00:17:51,001 --> 00:17:55,800
the country's kind of moved towards him.
And I think a lot of young people are,

391
00:17:55,801 --> 00:17:56,634
you know,
the one thing that is concerning to me 

392
00:17:59,130 --> 00:18:01,660
and I have great faith in the 
millennials and the gen x,

393
00:18:02,460 --> 00:18:03,293
but I'm not sure they understand the 
consequences of losing a representative 

394
00:18:09,361 --> 00:18:12,870
democracy.
There seems to be with some of them,

395
00:18:12,871 --> 00:18:15,880
some appeal towards an authoritarian 
figure.

396
00:18:15,910 --> 00:18:17,010
Have you.
Am I right on that?

397
00:18:17,011 --> 00:18:19,410
I think you have to tell me I haven't 
studied it,

398
00:18:19,411 --> 00:18:23,190
but I've got that sense that's not good 
or that you know,

399
00:18:23,191 --> 00:18:28,080
maybe socialism will work.
Look and free enterprise system.

400
00:18:28,081 --> 00:18:30,600
Michael Novak,
the great philosopher,

401
00:18:30,690 --> 00:18:31,523
theologian said that a free market 
system that is not underlaid with a set 

402
00:18:35,551 --> 00:18:38,550
of values is bankrupt.
So you have to have values.

403
00:18:38,550 --> 00:18:41,670
You can't just be in it to make money.
There has to be something else there.

404
00:18:42,570 --> 00:18:44,340
Where do you think those values come 
from?

405
00:18:45,210 --> 00:18:46,080
Oh,
I think they.

406
00:18:46,410 --> 00:18:47,243
I think that they.
The easy thing to say politically easy 

407
00:18:50,581 --> 00:18:54,360
thing to say as they come from mom and 
dad and I say to people,

408
00:18:54,361 --> 00:18:55,194
well,
where do you think mom and dad got it 

409
00:18:56,671 --> 00:18:57,730
from?
Well,

410
00:18:57,750 --> 00:18:58,583
they got it from their parents.
Where do I think these virtues come 

411
00:19:01,231 --> 00:19:03,510
from?
Look,

412
00:19:03,870 --> 00:19:05,610
if you're a humanist,
I respect you.

413
00:19:05,790 --> 00:19:07,620
Okay?
Uh,

414
00:19:07,650 --> 00:19:08,483
you wake up every day trying to figure 
out how to make the world a little 

415
00:19:11,041 --> 00:19:12,420
better place.
I like that.

416
00:19:12,450 --> 00:19:13,800
Okay.
But for me,

417
00:19:14,010 --> 00:19:18,330
the winds of change,
the fads can knock me off my path.

418
00:19:18,870 --> 00:19:19,703
So,
uh,

419
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:20,673
I need something deeper than that.
So I look to theologians and I believe 

420
00:19:26,100 --> 00:19:29,010
that we are,
we are a unique form of life,

421
00:19:29,190 --> 00:19:31,350
greater than all other life on the 
earth,

422
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:34,800
and I think that life has given to us by
our creator.

423
00:19:34,890 --> 00:19:35,723
And I think our creator has a character 
that we can learn about and that's not 

424
00:19:40,141 --> 00:19:43,710
only held by a Christian but also a Jew 
and also a Muslim.

425
00:19:43,711 --> 00:19:44,544
We have the same kind of view of 
creation and our purpose and within 

426
00:19:48,781 --> 00:19:53,781
those values are things like mercy and 
justice and compassion and forgiveness.

427
00:19:55,141 --> 00:19:57,060
And,
you know,

428
00:19:57,090 --> 00:19:57,923
um,
I don't know if you played golf that we 

429
00:19:59,401 --> 00:20:02,550
see we have to have mulligans in life 
because we know and I,

430
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:06,660
and the danger of talking about these 
things is that people want to say,

431
00:20:06,690 --> 00:20:07,171
oh,
well,

432
00:20:07,171 --> 00:20:08,880
you don't have great values.
I caught you.

433
00:20:09,090 --> 00:20:09,923
Yeah,
of course.

434
00:20:10,620 --> 00:20:13,470
I'm just a slob on a bus trying to make 
it through life,

435
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:16,680
you know,
but I kind of know what I need to do.

436
00:20:16,890 --> 00:20:20,580
So I think that these values,
they flow from,

437
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:24,780
from our creator.
And I think too much in religion today,

438
00:20:24,781 --> 00:20:26,640
which has turned off a lot of young 
people.

439
00:20:27,060 --> 00:20:27,893
Uh,
I'm actually mentoring a young man in 

440
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:31,553
faith,
but it's not about all this judgment we 

441
00:20:34,531 --> 00:20:36,690
hear.
It's about hope.

442
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:41,430
It's about human connectedness.
And that's appealing to people.

443
00:20:41,431 --> 00:20:45,270
And it's what I think is true about 
faith and virtue.

444
00:20:45,690 --> 00:20:49,300
It's not confining,
it's enlarging,

445
00:20:49,750 --> 00:20:52,480
it doesn't make you smaller.
It makes you bigger.

446
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:56,110
And today in religion we see a lot of 
forces that are counter to that.

447
00:20:56,111 --> 00:20:57,370
And I don't like it.
Yeah.

448
00:20:57,470 --> 00:20:58,780
Well,
it's interesting to me because my,

449
00:20:58,790 --> 00:21:01,140
my audience knows that Thomas Jefferson,
who was my favorite,

450
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:04,820
favorite founder and I go to the 
Jefferson memorial often in dc and I try

451
00:21:04,821 --> 00:21:08,260
to read those big plaques and to me 
they're as relevant now as they were,

452
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:09,273
you know,
200 some odd years ago where he talked 

453
00:21:11,211 --> 00:21:11,531
to,
you know,

454
00:21:11,531 --> 00:21:12,364
they talk about a creator at the same 
time they're talking about why church 

455
00:21:16,061 --> 00:21:17,320
and state have to be separate.

456
00:21:17,930 --> 00:21:20,260
And I think that's really to the heart 
of what you're saying.

457
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:22,450
Well,
I think first of all,

458
00:21:22,530 --> 00:21:23,363
um,
we don't want the government being 

459
00:21:26,141 --> 00:21:28,000
involved in religion.
Uh,

460
00:21:28,030 --> 00:21:31,390
we don't want that.
We want though in a free society.

461
00:21:31,391 --> 00:21:32,224
Look,
freedom means we have to learn to self 

462
00:21:34,211 --> 00:21:35,044
govern and if every time we turn around,
this is a big thing about facebook now 

463
00:21:39,700 --> 00:21:44,200
they didn't self-govern right?
I mean we can pass all these rules,

464
00:21:44,530 --> 00:21:47,230
but you know,
guys like you and me were met,

465
00:21:47,231 --> 00:21:49,360
were born to figure out how to get 
around the rules.

466
00:21:49,361 --> 00:21:50,194
Okay?
Right.

467
00:21:50,510 --> 00:21:52,540
I want to be free.
That's why we're both here,

468
00:21:52,910 --> 00:21:57,910
but what I'm saying is that you can't,
if you're going to have freedom,

469
00:21:58,300 --> 00:22:01,990
people have to have self restraint and 
the less self restraint we have,

470
00:22:02,020 --> 00:22:05,470
the more the government tries to impose 
things and the more they impose things,

471
00:22:05,471 --> 00:22:06,640
the less freedom we have.

472
00:22:06,970 --> 00:22:09,460
So I don't want it.
I believe that,

473
00:22:09,461 --> 00:22:10,390
that,
that our,

474
00:22:10,510 --> 00:22:12,340
our faith system,
and again,

475
00:22:12,341 --> 00:22:14,050
if you're a humanist,
that's cool with me,

476
00:22:14,220 --> 00:22:17,860
that's fine with me because you're 
trying to do good every day.

477
00:22:18,510 --> 00:22:19,343
I just,
it can't work for me because I get to 

478
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:24,400
knocked off kilter by the culture today 
and the winds of change.

479
00:22:24,700 --> 00:22:26,680
But with that system,
it,

480
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:30,220
it,
it reinforces the sense of freedom.

481
00:22:30,700 --> 00:22:32,980
So it's interesting.
You've referenced culture a couple times

482
00:22:32,981 --> 00:22:33,814
and one of the things that seem pretty 
obvious from an outside perspective of 

483
00:22:37,090 --> 00:22:40,540
the 2016 election was that trump 
captured the culture,

484
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:42,370
good or bad.
He captured that.

485
00:22:42,371 --> 00:22:46,720
He captured the Internet culture.
The reason that you're on.

486
00:22:46,750 --> 00:22:48,220
And I was like 80,000
votes,

487
00:22:48,221 --> 00:22:51,310
so we have to keep it in perspective and
trump is,

488
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:54,310
but he,
he's a negative populist.

489
00:22:54,970 --> 00:22:58,450
I'm a positive populist.
The people that I grew up with,

490
00:22:58,510 --> 00:23:01,570
when they're out at work or whatever,
my message is,

491
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:04,540
this is terrible,
but let's go fix it.

492
00:23:05,560 --> 00:23:09,970
I think the negative populous messages 
while you're out of work,

493
00:23:09,971 --> 00:23:12,610
because that guy over there took it away
from you.

494
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:13,933
He took your stuff away and that creates
a bitterness and an anger and there's 

495
00:23:17,831 --> 00:23:21,400
also a sense that that can translate 
into victim hood.

496
00:23:22,150 --> 00:23:24,700
I'm a victim.
You ever like to be a victim?

497
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:27,050
My,
I do not want to be a big no,

498
00:23:27,051 --> 00:23:29,140
but it's easy to be a victim.
Don't you think?

499
00:23:29,170 --> 00:23:30,003
It's very easy.
It's particularly if you have other 

500
00:23:30,971 --> 00:23:35,740
people around that want to be a victim.
Now I'm not going to condemn them,

501
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:37,833
but it's easy to fall into that.
If somebody tells you you don't have 

502
00:23:40,991 --> 00:23:45,350
something because somebody else took it.
So what we need to do is,

503
00:23:45,351 --> 00:23:47,630
if you were to go to say Youngstown,
Ohio,

504
00:23:47,631 --> 00:23:49,490
they talk about that a lot in the 
national news.

505
00:23:49,491 --> 00:23:50,810
And I was a steel worker.

506
00:23:50,810 --> 00:23:51,643
I worked in a coal mine in West Virginia
or whatever we have in Ohio working 

507
00:23:56,001 --> 00:23:56,750
with,
um,

508
00:23:56,750 --> 00:24:00,530
with one of the tech companies.
We have a list of all the job openings.

509
00:24:01,220 --> 00:24:01,881
Okay?
Now,

510
00:24:01,881 --> 00:24:05,640
if you're a victim and I come to you and
I say you are a coal miner or your steel

511
00:24:05,641 --> 00:24:08,600
worker and this would be hard for me to 
listen.

512
00:24:08,660 --> 00:24:11,000
I can show you this Internet stuff,
right?

513
00:24:11,240 --> 00:24:14,390
And I can get you one of these jobs.
You don't have to become an expert,

514
00:24:14,391 --> 00:24:16,700
but I can show you stuff.
If I'm a victim,

515
00:24:16,701 --> 00:24:18,890
I may not want to do it,
but if I,

516
00:24:18,891 --> 00:24:21,590
if I give that person a message,
hey,

517
00:24:21,950 --> 00:24:24,800
look at these jobs.
It pays good money.

518
00:24:24,860 --> 00:24:27,410
Your family will be healthier,
help will be healthier,

519
00:24:27,411 --> 00:24:31,280
your children will be healthier,
you will have more self respect,

520
00:24:31,820 --> 00:24:33,410
but you know,
it's tough where you are.

521
00:24:33,950 --> 00:24:36,560
I under that.
That is the better message than,

522
00:24:36,890 --> 00:24:37,723
well,
you're just a victim and we're going to 

523
00:24:38,931 --> 00:24:40,370
go and punish people.
Right?

524
00:24:40,430 --> 00:24:41,263
That's done.
It doesn't work for the good for the 

525
00:24:44,151 --> 00:24:46,250
mental health of our society.

526
00:24:46,370 --> 00:24:47,203
Yeah.
So I mean that's a great phrase right 

527
00:24:48,861 --> 00:24:50,520
there because we seem to be in a mental 
health.

528
00:24:50,540 --> 00:24:51,860
Came up with that.
That's pretty good.

529
00:24:51,890 --> 00:24:55,940
Did you write that down?
We can go back and hey,

530
00:24:56,180 --> 00:25:00,440
roll the tape back there.
They used to do that on television.

531
00:25:00,441 --> 00:25:03,710
Roll it today.
Could say we're long past their tape.

532
00:25:04,040 --> 00:25:06,950
There's no tape anymore.
It's all digital.

533
00:25:07,220 --> 00:25:10,400
So,
but negative populate the electrons back

534
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:11,580
and.
No,

535
00:25:11,580 --> 00:25:13,070
no.
So negative populism.

536
00:25:13,071 --> 00:25:13,904
Do you see that train coming?
Because it seems to me that trump 

537
00:25:17,001 --> 00:25:17,834
grabbed it.

538
00:25:18,490 --> 00:25:20,060
Istation.
He's not.

539
00:25:20,061 --> 00:25:22,970
He didn't create this people for a long 
time.

540
00:25:22,971 --> 00:25:25,280
I felt that the rich get richer and the 
poor get poorer.

541
00:25:25,490 --> 00:25:27,640
People in my party have ignored that.
Uh,

542
00:25:27,740 --> 00:25:30,140
maybe to some degree early on I did too.
I thought,

543
00:25:30,141 --> 00:25:31,190
well,
what's that all about?

544
00:25:31,610 --> 00:25:32,443
But it's true that you see these chasms 
and those are dangerous because you 

545
00:25:38,281 --> 00:25:39,114
know,
we need to believe that all this wealth 

546
00:25:40,881 --> 00:25:41,714
and everything changes.
They say that the ocean always kind of 

547
00:25:43,640 --> 00:25:44,473
flips upside down.
And that's what we need to see in our 

548
00:25:46,131 --> 00:25:46,940
country that,
you know,

549
00:25:46,940 --> 00:25:51,830
people in the bottom can get to the top 
and we look and Bayzos guy selling books

550
00:25:51,831 --> 00:25:54,440
out of his garage.
Look at you.

551
00:25:54,470 --> 00:25:56,780
It's just a matter of time til you're a 
billionaire,

552
00:25:56,870 --> 00:25:58,330
you know,
you,

553
00:25:58,540 --> 00:25:59,180
you know,

554
00:25:59,180 --> 00:26:00,013
operating out of this girl.
He's delivering me a lot of stuff 

555
00:26:03,320 --> 00:26:04,153
everyday.

556
00:26:05,660 --> 00:26:07,130
But you see what I'm saying?
I mean,

557
00:26:07,131 --> 00:26:11,780
it is possible to rise in a free society
with a free enterprise.

558
00:26:12,140 --> 00:26:13,110
And um,

559
00:26:13,660 --> 00:26:15,520
do you think we stopped selling that 
correctly?

560
00:26:15,521 --> 00:26:17,110
Because as you don't think we talk about
it.

561
00:26:17,140 --> 00:26:17,973
Yeah.
That young people now they starting to 

562
00:26:18,851 --> 00:26:20,050
think that socialism is

563
00:26:20,110 --> 00:26:20,591
cool.
Yeah,

564
00:26:20,591 --> 00:26:21,730
I don't,
I don't get that.

565
00:26:21,731 --> 00:26:22,391
I mean,
well,

566
00:26:22,391 --> 00:26:23,620
because it sounds good,
you know,

567
00:26:23,621 --> 00:26:26,260
like let's share.
I tell you a really interesting story.

568
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:28,260
My chief of staff,
there's that,

569
00:26:28,500 --> 00:26:29,333
you know,
that show that you get on your phone at 

570
00:26:30,791 --> 00:26:32,260
9:00
eastern.

571
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:35,230
It's like they ask questions and you 
answer the,

572
00:26:35,231 --> 00:26:37,300
my kids have done it for awhile.
They don't do it anymore.

573
00:26:37,450 --> 00:26:39,160
I don't know what,
what the show was called.

574
00:26:39,630 --> 00:26:41,590
Um,
well anyway,

575
00:26:41,591 --> 00:26:44,010
she and her kids,
daughters,

576
00:26:44,310 --> 00:26:46,950
they listened to this every,
every night at 9:00

577
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:51,090
and they work together and so she said 
one day to her kids,

578
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:53,430
why don't I,
I'll be on one phone and you got,

579
00:26:53,431 --> 00:26:55,170
you'll be on your phone and,
and,

580
00:26:55,230 --> 00:26:57,510
and joy,
you'll be on your phone and let's have a

581
00:26:57,511 --> 00:27:00,810
competition.
They looked at her like she was crazy.

582
00:27:01,410 --> 00:27:03,360
They're like,
why would we do that?

583
00:27:03,630 --> 00:27:04,740
You know,
so,

584
00:27:05,340 --> 00:27:06,500
you know,
when I,

585
00:27:06,510 --> 00:27:07,343
I guess what I'm saying about that is 
the idea of community and together is 

586
00:27:11,221 --> 00:27:12,054
good,
but we don't want that to erode the 

587
00:27:14,251 --> 00:27:19,251
basic sense that competition is good as 
long as it's played fairly and everybody

588
00:27:19,501 --> 00:27:21,630
has a chance to compete.
So really what you're talking about,

589
00:27:21,631 --> 00:27:22,464
you're sort of talking about 
individualism and how we can create 

590
00:27:25,321 --> 00:27:27,810
groups around that as opposed to 
collectivism,

591
00:27:27,811 --> 00:27:28,550
right?
Yeah.

592
00:27:28,550 --> 00:27:30,390
What really the thrust of that,
write that down.

593
00:27:30,510 --> 00:27:33,690
That's a good one individually rather 
than collectivism.

594
00:27:33,900 --> 00:27:35,550
But if you're a young person,
you go,

595
00:27:35,551 --> 00:27:39,660
I don't know what's wrong with that and,
but look there my hope,

596
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:44,580
because they would rather take a job 
that pays less if the job has meaning,

597
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:45,953
look at what they're doing in Parkland,
look at what these young people are 

598
00:27:48,001 --> 00:27:51,300
doing across this country and using 
social media to,

599
00:27:51,450 --> 00:27:52,440
to have a voice.

600
00:27:52,530 --> 00:27:54,480
I mean it's,
it's really awesome.

601
00:27:54,481 --> 00:27:57,740
I mean it's,
it gets me really pumped up because the.

602
00:27:57,750 --> 00:28:02,550
I think we need a new era of activism 
and citizenship and by the way,

603
00:28:03,330 --> 00:28:07,290
we're,
we fixate all the time on the leader.

604
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:12,210
Okay.
Did you see that movie on Churchill?

605
00:28:12,970 --> 00:28:14,610
Darkest Hour?
I didn't see it yet.

606
00:28:14,611 --> 00:28:17,190
I just saw the common law.
A lot of him in the crowd.

607
00:28:18,110 --> 00:28:20,280
You and Gary Oldman.
I know.

608
00:28:20,281 --> 00:28:22,080
I got to get out there.
It's on demand now.

609
00:28:22,140 --> 00:28:25,920
I'll do it tonight.
I'm giving you my word.

610
00:28:26,860 --> 00:28:28,610
Oh my word.
Yeah.

611
00:28:28,750 --> 00:28:29,820
Anyway,
here's the thing.

612
00:28:29,821 --> 00:28:33,030
Watching it tonight in that movie,
and this is made up stuff.

613
00:28:33,060 --> 00:28:36,000
He gets on,
he gets,

614
00:28:36,030 --> 00:28:41,030
goes down and gets on the subway and 
he's talking to people and they're like,

615
00:28:41,170 --> 00:28:42,720
you.
We're not given in,

616
00:28:43,650 --> 00:28:44,550
and they,
they,

617
00:28:44,820 --> 00:28:48,300
they embolden him,
set the fire in him.

618
00:28:49,080 --> 00:28:50,630
I'm not telling you that,
uh,

619
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:53,280
that he wasn't a great leader because he
clearly he was,

620
00:28:53,940 --> 00:28:56,430
but it was a bottom up and top down.

621
00:28:56,730 --> 00:28:57,563
I mean,
when we think about the civil rights 

622
00:28:58,621 --> 00:28:59,550
movement,
I mean,

623
00:28:59,551 --> 00:29:01,620
they didn't.
The great leaders,

624
00:29:01,621 --> 00:29:02,530
Martin Luther King,
David,

625
00:29:02,550 --> 00:29:05,010
good help politicians were afraid of 
him,

626
00:29:05,190 --> 00:29:07,800
including JFK.
Um,

627
00:29:07,980 --> 00:29:11,280
they were all afraid of him.
And what happened,

628
00:29:11,340 --> 00:29:13,380
it was,
it was from the street up,

629
00:29:14,130 --> 00:29:16,260
a lot of social change,
uh,

630
00:29:16,590 --> 00:29:17,423
the end of the Vietnam War.
How much longer would the generals have 

631
00:29:20,791 --> 00:29:22,980
said we were winning?
And by the way,

632
00:29:22,981 --> 00:29:24,690
look at Afghanistan,
they keep saying,

633
00:29:24,691 --> 00:29:26,640
oh,
we're victories just around the corner.

634
00:29:27,570 --> 00:29:29,160
Terrible.
Um,

635
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:30,713
and so you have a situation here where 
you can't just expect change in the 

636
00:29:35,611 --> 00:29:39,810
country because I have elected a good,
I have a new good coach,

637
00:29:39,811 --> 00:29:41,680
so therefore I'm going to win a 
basketball game.

638
00:29:41,800 --> 00:29:44,590
It doesn't work that way.
It works both ways.

639
00:29:44,591 --> 00:29:45,424
You a good leader,
but a great group of people that drive 

640
00:29:48,410 --> 00:29:49,243
that drive change.
How dangerous then is that cult of 

641
00:29:51,331 --> 00:29:54,040
personality that we've now made around 
the president,

642
00:29:54,041 --> 00:29:56,470
and I'm not just saying that trump here,
I mean even with Obama and plenty of the

643
00:29:56,471 --> 00:30:00,370
other presidents that we think that 
somehow the executive branch is going to

644
00:30:00,390 --> 00:30:02,620
fail,
this one person is going to fix it.

645
00:30:02,710 --> 00:30:03,543
You know,
there's a book that I don't know that 

646
00:30:05,460 --> 00:30:07,660
I'm like,
I don't know a lot of things here.

647
00:30:07,661 --> 00:30:09,910
I'm giving you might be over here.
The book is not.

648
00:30:09,911 --> 00:30:12,490
Here is a book that says this.
Um,

649
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:14,950
and I have never talked about this 
before.

650
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:18,130
Like on television.
I was with a,

651
00:30:18,131 --> 00:30:20,500
a,
a great preacher.

652
00:30:20,830 --> 00:30:22,780
A got 6,000
people.

653
00:30:22,781 --> 00:30:26,890
He's in the Silicon Valley.
He's very grace oriented and hopeful and

654
00:30:26,891 --> 00:30:30,210
he's just,
he's a phd in psychology.

655
00:30:30,220 --> 00:30:32,920
He's just got all this stuff,
all this talent.

656
00:30:33,580 --> 00:30:34,990
And I was asking him,
I said,

657
00:30:34,991 --> 00:30:37,540
I keep telling people it's bottom up,
not top down.

658
00:30:37,570 --> 00:30:38,530
He said,
well John,

659
00:30:38,531 --> 00:30:39,364
it's interesting because a man wrote a 
book and the book says that when pieces 

660
00:30:44,291 --> 00:30:48,460
of our society start to erode,
let's think about it.

661
00:30:49,630 --> 00:30:51,700
Facebook,
Wells Fargo,

662
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:55,480
a Equifax,
you know the scandal around,

663
00:30:55,481 --> 00:30:58,960
um,
around Volkswagen sports.

664
00:30:58,961 --> 00:30:59,794
You got guys that had brain injuries but
the league is and helping them and 

665
00:31:02,951 --> 00:31:04,480
they're living in a car.

666
00:31:04,620 --> 00:31:09,430
Their families are destitute or 
Hollywood need to say anything.

667
00:31:09,500 --> 00:31:10,333
They're a,
you look across the board and we're 

668
00:31:14,021 --> 00:31:17,560
seeing an erosion of what we really 
want.

669
00:31:17,590 --> 00:31:19,660
Right?
So there is a tendency,

670
00:31:19,661 --> 00:31:22,360
this man maintains that.
I'm fascinated to read this book,

671
00:31:23,020 --> 00:31:26,950
that we now start looking to politics to
solve these problems.

672
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:28,233
In other words,
we look at politicians or government to 

673
00:31:31,001 --> 00:31:34,060
use in a sense,
coercion,

674
00:31:34,120 --> 00:31:39,120
to restore things to the right balance 
and it just doesn't work that way.

675
00:31:40,181 --> 00:31:42,610
Really in practicality.
Now I'm the governor of the state.

676
00:31:42,611 --> 00:31:44,050
Seventh largest state.
I have a,

677
00:31:44,340 --> 00:31:45,173
it's a very powerful executive position,
but I can't just give edicts from up 

678
00:31:49,391 --> 00:31:54,391
here and expect it to work.
The people have to be engaged and ascent

679
00:31:54,820 --> 00:31:57,610
and do things.
They have to self govern,

680
00:31:57,640 --> 00:32:00,850
they have to lift.
And so this is a very,

681
00:32:00,851 --> 00:32:01,684
very.
I think this is like the next thing to 

682
00:32:04,181 --> 00:32:04,810
think about.

683
00:32:04,810 --> 00:32:06,160
To me it's the next wave.
You know what,

684
00:32:06,161 --> 00:32:11,161
I love what I think it has been fun 
because of my friends and because of the

685
00:32:12,810 --> 00:32:13,643
my mind in a way it works.
I'm kind of always looking for the next 

686
00:32:16,811 --> 00:32:19,270
thing and I can kind of sense the next 
thing,

687
00:32:19,390 --> 00:32:20,223
you know,
and I believe this is something that 

688
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:23,770
really needs to be talked about.
I mean,

689
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,410
it's a virtue.
It's religion,

690
00:32:26,740 --> 00:32:27,573
it's doing well by doing good.
It's driving ourselves from the bottom 

691
00:32:32,351 --> 00:32:33,184
up.
It's not trying to vest all this power 

692
00:32:34,691 --> 00:32:38,380
in a handful of people in the government
because I think it's futile.

693
00:32:38,680 --> 00:32:39,800
Yeah.
I hate to tell you this,

694
00:32:39,801 --> 00:32:42,140
but in a weird way,
you don't sound like a politician,

695
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:43,560
but I think you can take that as a 
column.

696
00:32:43,580 --> 00:32:43,990
No,
I'm,

697
00:32:43,990 --> 00:32:44,810
I'm,
I'm,

698
00:32:44,810 --> 00:32:45,360
look,
I'm,

699
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:48,440
I'm a public official.
I'm a CEO of a state.

700
00:32:49,280 --> 00:32:50,113
I'm sick of politics.
Drives me crazy because I see that in 

701
00:32:54,201 --> 00:32:57,630
the middle of trying to do things.
Um,

702
00:32:58,070 --> 00:33:00,920
we're all week,
we're all everybody's week and we're all

703
00:33:00,921 --> 00:33:03,230
susceptible to certain pressures,
you know,

704
00:33:03,231 --> 00:33:04,790
and,
and I'm like,

705
00:33:04,791 --> 00:33:07,120
we need to run through that door.
And they're like,

706
00:33:07,130 --> 00:33:07,761
oh no,
no,

707
00:33:07,761 --> 00:33:08,151
no,
no,

708
00:33:08,151 --> 00:33:09,800
no who slowdown here,
you know,

709
00:33:09,801 --> 00:33:11,510
and all that kind of stuff.
And it's,

710
00:33:11,540 --> 00:33:14,810
it's,
here's the problem with politics,

711
00:33:14,870 --> 00:33:15,703
you know,
you could sit next to somebody your 

712
00:33:17,121 --> 00:33:21,500
entire lifetime in an office job and 
never really know what they think.

713
00:33:21,950 --> 00:33:22,783
But in politics people get called out.
It's really interesting if they get 

714
00:33:28,041 --> 00:33:28,874
called out and it's in some ways it's 
not fair because it's almost like an x 

715
00:33:31,731 --> 00:33:34,970
ray like you know,
you and I could know each other,

716
00:33:34,971 --> 00:33:35,804
we could hang out,
we could watch basketball games and 

717
00:33:38,121 --> 00:33:38,954
never ever get into my finding out how 
you make decisions in a really tough 

718
00:33:43,251 --> 00:33:44,084
situation.

719
00:33:44,330 --> 00:33:48,590
But with politics you're going to have 
to vote and if you vote wrong,

720
00:33:48,591 --> 00:33:50,210
you're afraid you're going to lose.
I mean,

721
00:33:50,211 --> 00:33:52,240
it really,
it really is,

722
00:33:52,241 --> 00:33:54,980
is an amazing process and it's 
frustrating.

723
00:33:55,040 --> 00:33:55,873
My,
my friend and former guests a couple 

724
00:33:57,411 --> 00:33:58,430
times,
Eric Weinstein,

725
00:33:58,431 --> 00:33:59,264
who's a world renowned mathematician and
also and thinker and authors that he 

726
00:34:02,451 --> 00:34:06,080
talks about how one of the things we've 
lost now is communal sensemaking.

727
00:34:06,530 --> 00:34:09,350
That because everything has become so 
politicized,

728
00:34:09,351 --> 00:34:11,450
sports are politicized now.
Hollywood,

729
00:34:11,451 --> 00:34:14,990
as you just mentioned that all of these 
things have become so political,

730
00:34:14,991 --> 00:34:17,080
but what does that mean?
I don't know that term.

731
00:34:17,120 --> 00:34:18,740
What does that term?
So for example,

732
00:34:18,741 --> 00:34:19,281
like,
you know,

733
00:34:19,281 --> 00:34:20,114
everything that happened with the 
kneeling about the national anthem that 

734
00:34:22,671 --> 00:34:24,470
we start that if you turn on sports 
center,

735
00:34:24,471 --> 00:34:25,304
you're watching politics.
If you turn on the news and they're 

736
00:34:27,351 --> 00:34:29,300
talking about Hollywood,
it's about sex scan,

737
00:34:29,301 --> 00:34:34,301
but politics or is that a discussion of 
virtue or values?

738
00:34:35,480 --> 00:34:36,530
Is it politics,
you know?

739
00:34:36,580 --> 00:34:38,480
Well,
I guess at some level it's both,

740
00:34:38,481 --> 00:34:42,260
right on the underlying piece of.
It's a debate about behavior.

741
00:34:42,620 --> 00:34:45,380
It's behavior.
It's not really politics.

742
00:34:45,410 --> 00:34:46,243
No,
I understand what that person would be 

743
00:34:47,121 --> 00:34:47,954
saying.
I'm not sure that's the right 

744
00:34:48,891 --> 00:34:50,900
characterization.
So yeah,

745
00:34:50,901 --> 00:34:52,400
you're right on espn,
you know,

746
00:34:52,401 --> 00:34:53,390
there's a lot of,
you know,

747
00:34:53,391 --> 00:34:57,650
there's a lot of angst over there now 
because of different positions.

748
00:34:58,460 --> 00:34:59,293
Uh,
but really kinda debating how we're 

749
00:35:01,521 --> 00:35:03,710
supposed to behave,
don't you think?

750
00:35:03,860 --> 00:35:05,380
Yeah.
Well that's what we're doing now.

751
00:35:05,390 --> 00:35:06,223
What was so amazing about the kneeling 
it was brought about by the guy that 

752
00:35:10,431 --> 00:35:12,770
played for the 40 niners.
People didn't know this.

753
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:13,880
I was told this,
you know,

754
00:35:13,881 --> 00:35:15,580
he's a devout Christian.
Yeah,

755
00:35:16,290 --> 00:35:18,040
Colin Kaepernick.
When,

756
00:35:18,120 --> 00:35:19,130
when people hear that,
they're like,

757
00:35:19,131 --> 00:35:20,180
Whoa,
you know,

758
00:35:20,181 --> 00:35:21,014
isn't it interesting that when we dig 
into somebody who we feel one way or 

759
00:35:25,851 --> 00:35:26,684
another about,
it's amazing sometimes how we find out 

760
00:35:28,971 --> 00:35:32,450
things that change our fundamental 
attitude towards them.

761
00:35:33,020 --> 00:35:33,853
Did you find that that whole situation 
actually was what was right about 

762
00:35:37,140 --> 00:35:37,973
America in a bizarre way?
I found that everybody was screaming 

763
00:35:39,661 --> 00:35:40,470
about,
here's what I.

764
00:35:40,470 --> 00:35:42,300
here's what nobody was staying in jail 
and everywhere.

765
00:35:42,301 --> 00:35:43,134
All.
But here's what I think where it got 

766
00:35:44,641 --> 00:35:49,260
lost.
I don't feel that the players themselves

767
00:35:49,261 --> 00:35:50,094
were able to articulate to Americans 
exactly why they were doing that and 

768
00:35:54,541 --> 00:35:55,374
exactly what they wanted,
I think was kind of lost in the motion 

769
00:35:58,651 --> 00:36:02,340
as opposed to what is real?
What's behind this?

770
00:36:02,520 --> 00:36:04,500
You know,
what is really behind this,

771
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:05,633
you know,
I'm a black man and I've worn my kid 

772
00:36:08,360 --> 00:36:09,193
that be careful about when you're out 
there late at night and what you might 

773
00:36:12,181 --> 00:36:13,610
find.
Um,

774
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:17,370
I think if people heard that and they 
understood that,

775
00:36:17,371 --> 00:36:18,360
they would say,
oh,

776
00:36:18,780 --> 00:36:19,613
so that was the one way you had to say 
something because it's so divided the 

777
00:36:23,341 --> 00:36:24,174
country.

778
00:36:24,420 --> 00:36:25,890
Um,
now,

779
00:36:26,010 --> 00:36:27,450
uh,
you know,

780
00:36:27,451 --> 00:36:29,370
and people had different views.
But you know,

781
00:36:29,371 --> 00:36:30,870
what I found,
Dave,

782
00:36:30,871 --> 00:36:31,704
what I have found in my life is if you 
pull people together like we have on 

783
00:36:34,741 --> 00:36:36,330
police and community,
tough issue.

784
00:36:36,870 --> 00:36:41,580
I just had two police officers killed,
murdered in my little hometown in Ohio.

785
00:36:41,581 --> 00:36:43,230
You heard about it happened a couple of 
weeks ago.

786
00:36:44,280 --> 00:36:48,630
Community needs to understand that mom 
and dad need to go home at night.

787
00:36:49,530 --> 00:36:50,050
You know,
they,

788
00:36:50,050 --> 00:36:51,340
they're at risk.
They,

789
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:56,120
you go to a domestic disturbance and you
have to go in a door.

790
00:36:56,960 --> 00:37:00,960
You are putting your life on the line.
Community needs to understand it,

791
00:37:01,410 --> 00:37:03,560
but police need to understand that if 
you are,

792
00:37:03,780 --> 00:37:05,430
that they need understand that 
community.

793
00:37:05,431 --> 00:37:07,350
If you're not treating people right in 
the community,

794
00:37:07,380 --> 00:37:11,610
you're going to have a problem.
Sit them down the bet,

795
00:37:11,611 --> 00:37:13,050
peel to the better angels.

796
00:37:13,050 --> 00:37:16,560
And in many cases you can come up with 
resolutions,

797
00:37:16,561 --> 00:37:17,394
but you have to get the right people in 
a room and you have to appeal to the 

798
00:37:19,651 --> 00:37:21,090
better angels of them.
Yeah,

799
00:37:21,091 --> 00:37:23,790
I suspect you don't think trump is 
appealing to better angels.

800
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:25,400
That seems to be pretty.
No,

801
00:37:25,410 --> 00:37:26,243
I mean,
I think that,

802
00:37:26,280 --> 00:37:27,090
you know,
look,

803
00:37:27,090 --> 00:37:31,800
my job on this is to my job.
I have a position,

804
00:37:31,801 --> 00:37:33,450
a platform,
I can say things.

805
00:37:34,500 --> 00:37:36,230
I'm not here to be,
you know,

806
00:37:36,450 --> 00:37:39,600
knee jerk against trump.
If he does a good thing,

807
00:37:39,601 --> 00:37:42,600
he shouldn't be praised.
And if he does something that's dividing

808
00:37:42,601 --> 00:37:43,434
us,
then I can't support it to the point 

809
00:37:45,841 --> 00:37:48,960
where I didn't even go to the convention
in my state or ever endorsed him.

810
00:37:48,961 --> 00:37:51,810
I wasn't like weaseling around.
I would say that's the wrong word.

811
00:37:52,170 --> 00:37:54,040
I wasn't maneuvering around to say,
okay,

812
00:37:54,210 --> 00:37:56,140
one day I liked him and the next day I 
did.

813
00:37:56,140 --> 00:37:57,840
And I just was,
was consistent.

814
00:37:57,970 --> 00:37:59,460
Look,
I took a lot of heat for it.

815
00:37:59,580 --> 00:38:00,413
The amount of pressure that you must 
have gotten from the party and from 

816
00:38:02,430 --> 00:38:03,990
pressure.
What is pressure pressure?

817
00:38:03,991 --> 00:38:05,180
Whether they say pressures,
uh,

818
00:38:05,620 --> 00:38:08,280
a guy that loses his job,
he's got a couple kids to feed.

819
00:38:08,310 --> 00:38:10,950
That's pressure pressure in politics.
What are they going to do to me?

820
00:38:11,010 --> 00:38:12,540
You know,
what they're going to criticize me,

821
00:38:12,541 --> 00:38:16,120
make you know what we talked.
I mean,

822
00:38:16,140 --> 00:38:18,580
briefly just now about the anthem part.
What,

823
00:38:18,581 --> 00:38:20,220
what are you making the state of race in
America?

824
00:38:20,221 --> 00:38:21,690
If you listen to a lot of people right 
now,

825
00:38:21,691 --> 00:38:24,520
it seems like we're at the worst racial 
state that we've been.

826
00:38:25,470 --> 00:38:27,450
No,
I think we've made a lot of progress.

827
00:38:27,451 --> 00:38:28,284
I do.
I think though that what we're seeing 

828
00:38:29,611 --> 00:38:30,444
now is it's back to this.
I don't want somebody getting something 

829
00:38:34,141 --> 00:38:38,050
that I don't get and somebody else took 
what I have and why doesn't anybody care

830
00:38:38,051 --> 00:38:38,884
about me?

831
00:38:39,370 --> 00:38:41,980
And I think that caring about me is 
real.

832
00:38:42,550 --> 00:38:43,420
Dave,
I do.

833
00:38:43,700 --> 00:38:46,720
Um,
let's say that you,

834
00:38:46,970 --> 00:38:47,803
that you have a kid and you need and you
need a pill to deal with that kid's 

835
00:38:53,021 --> 00:38:56,110
problem,
but it's expensive and you can't get it.

836
00:38:56,170 --> 00:38:58,840
Does anybody stand up for you?
You know,

837
00:38:58,900 --> 00:39:03,040
if this is where people feel like,
and this is where community matters,

838
00:39:03,730 --> 00:39:04,560
you know,
they,

839
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:05,710
if,
if I'm,

840
00:39:05,800 --> 00:39:08,140
if,
if I'm being harassed at work,

841
00:39:08,950 --> 00:39:13,210
how about that story in a New York Times
where these waitresses were being told,

842
00:39:13,211 --> 00:39:15,700
let me grope you and I'll give you a $20
tip.

843
00:39:15,701 --> 00:39:16,534
I mean,
who in that restaurant saw that and 

844
00:39:17,731 --> 00:39:19,420
said,
I'm going to take you outside,

845
00:39:19,930 --> 00:39:22,420
right?
To the guy that was the perpetrator.

846
00:39:23,680 --> 00:39:24,513
People tend to feel,
I think too much of the time that we're 

847
00:39:27,701 --> 00:39:32,230
in this alone that doesn't that kind of 
get back to the overstate this,

848
00:39:32,231 --> 00:39:35,080
but back to the texting and the no 
communication.

849
00:39:36,070 --> 00:39:40,360
We got to care about our neighbor.
The way our neighbor cares about us.

850
00:39:40,361 --> 00:39:41,590
We're.
I learned that from my mother.

851
00:39:41,591 --> 00:39:42,850
You know,
tell you interesting story.

852
00:39:43,180 --> 00:39:44,013
My mother and I,
we would hang out at the school all the 

853
00:39:46,571 --> 00:39:49,960
time and there's,
the kids came up and gave his pony rides

854
00:39:50,020 --> 00:39:54,580
and my mother wanted to checkout what 
does this whole thing going on up there?

855
00:39:54,581 --> 00:39:59,581
So she comes up and I don't have.
It's probably a dime to do a pony ride.

856
00:40:00,451 --> 00:40:01,284
And and my mother was there and she gave
the guy that had the pony a lot more 

857
00:40:06,221 --> 00:40:09,400
money than the cost of the pony ride.
And we were walking home and I said,

858
00:40:09,401 --> 00:40:11,380
mom,
you gave that guy a lot of money.

859
00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:12,641
She said,
Johnny,

860
00:40:12,641 --> 00:40:16,150
did you see?
As I was out of place,

861
00:40:16,890 --> 00:40:17,723
we got to help people like that.
Like I used to see my father given a 

862
00:40:20,321 --> 00:40:21,154
couple extra bucks to the guy that 
picked up the trash because he didn't 

863
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:24,273
make much money.

864
00:40:24,770 --> 00:40:29,050
I'm like,
thanks mom and dad,

865
00:40:30,220 --> 00:40:32,650
because that's something you carry.
All right.

866
00:40:32,651 --> 00:40:35,650
So this is interesting because I feel 
like I'm talking to half philosopher,

867
00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:37,390
half governor here.
So let's go.

868
00:40:37,391 --> 00:40:40,180
Let's finish with solutions.
I like that.

869
00:40:40,181 --> 00:40:42,000
By the way,
half philosopher,

870
00:40:42,010 --> 00:40:43,450
half politician,
governor,

871
00:40:43,540 --> 00:40:44,800
you said,
oh governor,

872
00:40:44,920 --> 00:40:46,360
that we go.
That was fun.

873
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:47,800
But that on your business.
There you go.

874
00:40:48,030 --> 00:40:50,950
You don't have to credit me.
So I want to talk some solutions because

875
00:40:51,490 --> 00:40:55,180
so many things seem wrong in 2016 that I
think that's what led us here.

876
00:40:55,181 --> 00:40:57,760
So we can talk about some of the 
specific things.

877
00:40:57,761 --> 00:40:59,620
So like watching the debates that you 
were part of,

878
00:40:59,730 --> 00:41:01,570
they're the dumbest way to pick a 
president.

879
00:41:01,630 --> 00:41:03,260
Okay.
You can't get from A.

880
00:41:03,660 --> 00:41:06,910
Well you can't pick the way to do it is 
now.

881
00:41:06,911 --> 00:41:08,140
Look,
it's all about ratings.

882
00:41:08,141 --> 00:41:10,300
Okay.
So nobody wants to change the format,

883
00:41:10,301 --> 00:41:11,710
but the way it ought to be is what we're
doing.

884
00:41:11,860 --> 00:41:14,350
Let people,
let somebody interview somebody,

885
00:41:14,351 --> 00:41:17,680
find out who they are and then we can 
judge instead of like,

886
00:41:17,681 --> 00:41:19,660
who's got the cleverest line or who,
you know,

887
00:41:19,661 --> 00:41:23,170
it's really stupid when you were up 
there and trump,

888
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:24,033
you know,
usually he was brow beating everybody 

889
00:41:25,211 --> 00:41:26,044
and you could see sort of each debate 
would go by and he'd pick who he had to 

890
00:41:28,151 --> 00:41:29,770
go for and,
and you know,

891
00:41:29,771 --> 00:41:34,130
the media kind of fell along with that.
That really wasn't for what you're doing

892
00:41:34,131 --> 00:41:36,560
here is the field narrowed.
He just didn't show up anymore.

893
00:41:37,140 --> 00:41:40,460
He didn't debate anymore.
I mean I wanted them to debate that he,

894
00:41:41,360 --> 00:41:42,193
towards the end when you,
when you stayed to the other guy was 

895
00:41:44,151 --> 00:41:45,920
down to fewer and fewer of us.
Yeah.

896
00:41:46,480 --> 00:41:49,430
But I just think it's a bad way to pick 
a president now.

897
00:41:49,431 --> 00:41:50,264
We,
I think this all started probably with 

898
00:41:51,621 --> 00:41:55,490
Kennedy and Nixon and Nixon lost because
he looked,

899
00:41:55,491 --> 00:41:57,860
he didn't have the right brow,
he was sweating.

900
00:41:57,860 --> 00:41:59,150
I mean,
what a dumb way to pick,

901
00:41:59,210 --> 00:42:00,800
pick a leader.
So,

902
00:42:00,890 --> 00:42:02,390
uh,
I don't know if that'll change.

903
00:42:02,420 --> 00:42:05,090
I don't know because it makes too much 
money for the networks.

904
00:42:05,870 --> 00:42:09,590
So what are the things we can do to just
change the electoral system enough?

905
00:42:09,591 --> 00:42:12,830
Like I'm not somebody that believes you 
have to go in and wreck everything,

906
00:42:13,100 --> 00:42:15,060
but it seems to me if we could just 
tweak something.

907
00:42:15,061 --> 00:42:15,894
Well,
gerrymandering needs to be changed so 

908
00:42:16,941 --> 00:42:17,774
that we're not.
Gerrymandering is where you draw 

909
00:42:19,110 --> 00:42:22,220
district to favor one party or the other
and then all you have to do is listen to

910
00:42:22,221 --> 00:42:25,490
people and you're extreme and not have 
to listen to people who are,

911
00:42:26,390 --> 00:42:28,670
who are different than you,
but you need to be heard.

912
00:42:29,060 --> 00:42:31,610
That's one thing.
Don't have an answer for the finance,

913
00:42:31,660 --> 00:42:33,590
the spending.
I don't know what to do about it,

914
00:42:33,591 --> 00:42:34,790
but I'm open to anything.

915
00:42:35,120 --> 00:42:38,000
So those are a couple of things that 
really the issue though,

916
00:42:38,120 --> 00:42:39,920
I mean at the end of the day is it 
really,

917
00:42:39,921 --> 00:42:42,340
if we were just to go backwards with 
everything,

918
00:42:42,720 --> 00:42:43,553
I think gerrymandering is very,
very serious problem and we are fixing 

919
00:42:47,031 --> 00:42:49,550
it in Ohio and I'm proud of my 
legislature for doing it.

920
00:42:49,940 --> 00:42:52,760
That's a big part of it,
but it isn't a big part of it.

921
00:42:52,761 --> 00:42:56,420
Also the kind of people we elect,
you know,

922
00:42:56,421 --> 00:43:01,310
and do you carry virtue into these 
offices and be willing to take a risk.

923
00:43:01,850 --> 00:43:04,940
I've got a friend of mine now who's just
got on the city council and he called me

924
00:43:04,941 --> 00:43:05,721
the other day.
He said,

925
00:43:05,721 --> 00:43:08,540
I just seem to be making everybody mad 
because they all want to have this,

926
00:43:08,930 --> 00:43:11,270
this thing that they want to do and I 
just think it's dumb.

927
00:43:11,271 --> 00:43:11,841
And I said,
yeah,

928
00:43:11,841 --> 00:43:13,040
just just,
you know,

929
00:43:13,041 --> 00:43:15,140
pick your battles and be pleasant than 
before.

930
00:43:15,890 --> 00:43:16,723
And you know,
we shouldn't want to be in these jobs 

931
00:43:18,981 --> 00:43:19,820
forever.
It's natural.

932
00:43:19,821 --> 00:43:21,710
Nobody wants to go to work and lose 
their job.

933
00:43:22,420 --> 00:43:23,810
Okay.
Nobody wants to do that,

934
00:43:24,320 --> 00:43:26,930
but you're not in these jobs for,
you know,

935
00:43:26,931 --> 00:43:27,764
for a long time.
I don't think you should be at the end 

936
00:43:30,980 --> 00:43:31,813
of the day.
Is that really what the government's 

937
00:43:32,511 --> 00:43:34,760
role is?
Just making sure we have jobs.

938
00:43:34,820 --> 00:43:35,451
I mean really,
you know,

939
00:43:35,451 --> 00:43:36,284
making sure we're basically secure.
I think it's the greatest moral purpose 

940
00:43:38,780 --> 00:43:39,613
is,
is to provide an environment for job 

941
00:43:41,901 --> 00:43:44,030
creation because that's what creates 
human dignity,

942
00:43:44,390 --> 00:43:45,223
right?
That's what strengthens communities and 

943
00:43:46,790 --> 00:43:49,780
builds a strengthened families.
Uh,

944
00:43:49,781 --> 00:43:50,614
you know,
for the government of the United States 

945
00:43:51,760 --> 00:43:54,710
to make sure that we have a,
we are protected,

946
00:43:54,950 --> 00:43:55,783
that we can be free and yet safe.
And then it's also course domestic 

947
00:43:59,421 --> 00:44:00,590
tranquility.
You know,

948
00:44:00,591 --> 00:44:03,950
that we're at peace where we are.
So if you have high unemployment,

949
00:44:03,980 --> 00:44:04,940
it's terrible.

950
00:44:04,940 --> 00:44:05,773
So I believe our greatest moral purpose 
as politician for me and my job is the 

951
00:44:10,011 --> 00:44:12,860
fact that I need to have a job creating 
environment.

952
00:44:13,130 --> 00:44:14,510
So it's interesting as I'm listening to 
you,

953
00:44:14,511 --> 00:44:15,344
I can understand the reasons for not 
liking trump and the tweets and virtue 

954
00:44:20,001 --> 00:44:23,630
and all of that.
I can get that in terms of policy of the

955
00:44:23,631 --> 00:44:25,010
things that he's done.
Well,

956
00:44:25,011 --> 00:44:27,410
let's talk about a couple of things.
Let's talk about immigration.

957
00:44:27,490 --> 00:44:30,430
I mean the idea that we're going to ship
these Daca kids out to me as well,

958
00:44:30,710 --> 00:44:31,543
but we're.
I don't even know where the Democrats 

959
00:44:32,581 --> 00:44:33,540
are.
We keep talking about trump.

960
00:44:33,541 --> 00:44:34,374
I mean we're in the Democrats.
Is Bart is Bernie and his left wing 

961
00:44:37,710 --> 00:44:38,860
philosophy.
Is that where,

962
00:44:38,880 --> 00:44:42,540
I don't know where the Democrats are,
but this Daca thing should be solved.

963
00:44:42,541 --> 00:44:43,980
I mean these are,
these are people,

964
00:44:43,981 --> 00:44:44,701
you know,
25,

965
00:44:44,701 --> 00:44:46,320
26,
27 years old.

966
00:44:46,500 --> 00:44:48,510
It came here when they were six or seven
or eight.

967
00:44:48,511 --> 00:44:49,344
Now we're going to ship them out and 
there are a meaningful part of our 

968
00:44:50,851 --> 00:44:51,610
culture.
So.

969
00:44:51,610 --> 00:44:55,140
So what do you actually do then?
What they oughta be grandfathered in.

970
00:44:55,141 --> 00:44:55,974
They ought to be said.
You get to stay and then when it comes 

971
00:44:58,261 --> 00:45:02,130
to immigration itself,
we need to know who's coming and we need

972
00:45:02,131 --> 00:45:05,070
to be able to protect our borders,
but I don't want to be shrinking legal,

973
00:45:05,071 --> 00:45:05,904
immigration.
I think people create a great deal to 

974
00:45:07,831 --> 00:45:10,020
our country,
a trade,

975
00:45:10,080 --> 00:45:11,730
you know,
it's a thorny issue,

976
00:45:11,731 --> 00:45:12,564
but 40 million Americans have trade 
related jobs and most of the businesses 

977
00:45:16,711 --> 00:45:21,630
that are involved in exporting or small 
and medium size businesses and consumers

978
00:45:21,631 --> 00:45:22,464
benefit from open and free enough.
It's not open and free find and have a 

979
00:45:24,961 --> 00:45:29,190
process to restore equity but just don't
go out to create a trade war.

980
00:45:29,460 --> 00:45:30,750
Um,
you know,

981
00:45:30,751 --> 00:45:33,450
I mean those are things.
What else you want to ask about?

982
00:45:33,540 --> 00:45:35,190
I mean those are two that jump out at 
me.

983
00:45:35,191 --> 00:45:36,090
There's lots of them.

984
00:45:36,140 --> 00:45:36,973
Yeah.
Well I'll throw a couple others that we 

985
00:45:38,121 --> 00:45:38,954
actually did meet once before it was at,
I believe it was the first or second 

986
00:45:41,571 --> 00:45:44,290
Republican debate and I asked you a 
question and you know,

987
00:45:44,300 --> 00:45:45,133
with everyone's jamming the nice,
strong enough where we're jamming their 

988
00:45:48,110 --> 00:45:49,910
megaphones in my face.
Trust me,

989
00:45:49,911 --> 00:45:51,950
I had to fight through plenty of people 
to get the question.

990
00:45:51,951 --> 00:45:52,784
But basically at my question to you,
was that the social issues that gay 

991
00:45:56,331 --> 00:45:57,400
marriage in particular,
I,

992
00:45:57,401 --> 00:45:58,234
I could tell you,
I think at the first debate you 

993
00:45:59,571 --> 00:46:00,404
immediately said they asked you about it
and you said that's not what I want to 

994
00:46:02,601 --> 00:46:03,970
focus on.
I think,

995
00:46:04,120 --> 00:46:04,290
yeah,

996
00:46:04,290 --> 00:46:06,590
I remember exactly what I said,
but it did get a uh,

997
00:46:06,600 --> 00:46:07,433
you know,
look,

998
00:46:08,400 --> 00:46:09,200
I,
I,

999
00:46:09,200 --> 00:46:10,290
it,
it's not,

1000
00:46:10,500 --> 00:46:11,333
I'm not,
that's not where I want to live because 

1001
00:46:12,721 --> 00:46:14,420
that is a dividing.
I mean,

1002
00:46:14,490 --> 00:46:16,050
in terms of gay marriage,
I'm fine with it.

1003
00:46:16,051 --> 00:46:16,884
I mean,
I think it was that time when I said I 

1004
00:46:17,941 --> 00:46:20,940
was going to a,
a wedding of my,

1005
00:46:21,090 --> 00:46:22,020
of my gate,
you know,

1006
00:46:22,021 --> 00:46:24,330
one of my gay friends who's terrific and
I talked to them all that.

1007
00:46:24,360 --> 00:46:25,193
I mean,
I don't even think that way that's 

1008
00:46:26,490 --> 00:46:27,660
behind,
that's beyond us.

1009
00:46:27,690 --> 00:46:30,240
So you'd love for the Republicans to get
past the social stuff,

1010
00:46:30,241 --> 00:46:30,571
right?
I mean,

1011
00:46:30,571 --> 00:46:31,404
I think in effect the party has even 
even the more conservative Christian 

1012
00:46:34,051 --> 00:46:35,880
side of the party is in talking about 
it.

1013
00:46:35,881 --> 00:46:36,714
That,
and I got on here Santorum or how could 

1014
00:46:38,061 --> 00:46:40,110
he really rally taller?

1015
00:46:40,470 --> 00:46:41,360
And it's,
you know,

1016
00:46:41,640 --> 00:46:44,400
things have changed and um,
you know,

1017
00:46:44,401 --> 00:46:47,440
I prefer the traditional marriage,
but you know,

1018
00:46:47,490 --> 00:46:49,920
I'm not like I don't worry what you're 
doing and they're not.

1019
00:46:50,260 --> 00:46:53,230
You mentioned to me it's your 21st 
anniversary with your wife today.

1020
00:46:53,300 --> 00:46:55,600
Exactly.
And I'm here and here you are with me.

1021
00:46:57,520 --> 00:47:00,640
What does that say?
I don't know what that says.

1022
00:47:00,820 --> 00:47:01,653
Well,
where are you on a medical marijuana or 

1023
00:47:03,450 --> 00:47:04,283
illegally?

1024
00:47:05,290 --> 00:47:07,230
I'm not for legalizing it because it 
gets.

1025
00:47:07,370 --> 00:47:09,040
I,
I told people when I was in college,

1026
00:47:09,041 --> 00:47:10,710
of course I smoke dope.
I mean we,

1027
00:47:10,740 --> 00:47:13,000
we all did,
we all did.

1028
00:47:13,001 --> 00:47:14,430
But many of us did.
Um,

1029
00:47:14,710 --> 00:47:17,650
but here's the problem.
You can't tell kids don't do drugs,

1030
00:47:17,920 --> 00:47:19,120
but by the way,
this drugs.

1031
00:47:19,121 --> 00:47:21,370
Okay.
So it's a problem.

1032
00:47:21,430 --> 00:47:22,263
Medical Marijuana,
we have it in our state and we have it 

1033
00:47:25,601 --> 00:47:26,434
in our state,
but I don't think legalizing it is a 

1034
00:47:28,181 --> 00:47:29,440
good thing to do.
Yeah.

1035
00:47:29,710 --> 00:47:32,620
Is this one of those things where.
So when I hear that to me,

1036
00:47:32,621 --> 00:47:35,530
this is where my libertarian side 
kicking him and I would say,

1037
00:47:35,531 --> 00:47:38,290
well you can put anything in your body 
that you want.

1038
00:47:38,291 --> 00:47:41,310
And as long as you're doing it in the 
privacy of your own home and the rest of

1039
00:47:41,311 --> 00:47:43,060
that's a bad argument.
Makes a lot of sense to me.

1040
00:47:43,060 --> 00:47:46,030
But you think that if we just sort of 
unfurl this,

1041
00:47:46,031 --> 00:47:49,240
that just say I got kids here.
I mean we've got an opiate crisis.

1042
00:47:49,241 --> 00:47:49,970
I mean,
you know,

1043
00:47:49,970 --> 00:47:52,870
I just was looking last night you got 
fentinol and these street drugs,

1044
00:47:52,871 --> 00:47:53,704
whether it's coke or,
or heroin and just dropping dead left 

1045
00:47:56,711 --> 00:47:57,910
and right.
Um,

1046
00:47:58,810 --> 00:48:02,620
this is not a time when I think we ought
to be trying to say to kids,

1047
00:48:02,770 --> 00:48:03,311
okay,
what?

1048
00:48:03,311 --> 00:48:05,560
Don't do any drugs,
but you know,

1049
00:48:05,580 --> 00:48:08,320
but this one's okay to do.
That's kind of how I feel about it.

1050
00:48:08,860 --> 00:48:09,970
And yet,
you know,

1051
00:48:09,980 --> 00:48:11,390
alcoholics,
you know.

1052
00:48:11,530 --> 00:48:12,363
No.
And we look and we have a lot of people 

1053
00:48:14,051 --> 00:48:14,884
die from drunk driving and all that.
But we'd been through that and I don't 

1054
00:48:18,101 --> 00:48:20,230
know where this is all going to 
ultimately end up.

1055
00:48:20,231 --> 00:48:23,320
I'm just giving you my sense dealing 
with a real problem here.

1056
00:48:23,620 --> 00:48:28,060
I don't want to have to explain to young
people the two that you can do this,

1057
00:48:28,061 --> 00:48:30,520
but don't do that.
It needs to be a simple message for me.

1058
00:48:30,580 --> 00:48:31,181
Yeah.
Okay.

1059
00:48:31,181 --> 00:48:33,340
A couple more.
And then the big question at the end.

1060
00:48:33,341 --> 00:48:34,320
So,
uh,

1061
00:48:34,510 --> 00:48:35,840
I can answer the big question.
Dan.

1062
00:48:35,870 --> 00:48:37,450
I don't know what I'm going to do in 20,
20.

1063
00:48:37,540 --> 00:48:40,270
I don't know what I'm going to do.
I really don't know.

1064
00:48:40,271 --> 00:48:41,104
I am.
I want to be able to participate in a 

1065
00:48:43,931 --> 00:48:44,764
positive way in the public debate that's
I want my voice to be out there and 

1066
00:48:47,981 --> 00:48:50,830
that's Kinda what I wanna do and I don't
know where that's gonna take me.

1067
00:48:50,860 --> 00:48:51,693
I'm not plotting and scheming,
but I'm making a lot of effort to be 

1068
00:48:55,121 --> 00:48:57,790
able to have the resources to be able to
stay.

1069
00:48:57,910 --> 00:49:00,490
All options are really on the table,
but I don't know what,

1070
00:49:00,670 --> 00:49:04,180
what will be exercise because we don't 
know what the future's going to bring.

1071
00:49:04,270 --> 00:49:05,103
The big question is going to be whether 
you want it to play golf with me after 

1072
00:49:06,641 --> 00:49:08,620
this,
but are you a good golfer?

1073
00:49:08,621 --> 00:49:10,890
Not well,
but I not.

1074
00:49:10,980 --> 00:49:11,741
Well.
Uh,

1075
00:49:11,741 --> 00:49:12,310
okay.
Well,

1076
00:49:12,310 --> 00:49:13,810
all right,
that was the answer to that question.

1077
00:49:13,990 --> 00:49:16,060
A couple of things.
So you're in California right now.

1078
00:49:16,061 --> 00:49:16,894
I know you just met with Arnold 
Schwarzenegger and you guys are talking 

1079
00:49:19,181 --> 00:49:22,990
about how to reset Californian in 
politics.

1080
00:49:23,340 --> 00:49:26,440
I'm here in California.
It's an insanely high tax state.

1081
00:49:26,780 --> 00:49:28,950
If I told you what my property taxes on 
this place,

1082
00:49:28,970 --> 00:49:29,803
your head would explode.
I should probably move to Ohio if you 

1083
00:49:31,511 --> 00:49:33,820
want to help her.
All my property taxes are high enough.

1084
00:49:33,821 --> 00:49:36,280
It makes my head explode.
Driving in my state.

1085
00:49:36,510 --> 00:49:37,690
Trust me in La.
Yeah.

1086
00:49:37,950 --> 00:49:39,150
Um,
what,

1087
00:49:39,170 --> 00:49:41,860
what do you think can be done to help a 
place like California?

1088
00:49:41,861 --> 00:49:44,650
That's obviously so less traditional.
It's happening though,

1089
00:49:44,651 --> 00:49:46,390
is you're beginning to lose people.

1090
00:49:46,440 --> 00:49:47,020
Yeah.
You know,

1091
00:49:47,020 --> 00:49:50,710
whether it's to Washington state,
no income tax or to Nevada,

1092
00:49:51,150 --> 00:49:52,330
uh,
or to Austin,

1093
00:49:52,331 --> 00:49:53,141
Texas.
I mean,

1094
00:49:53,141 --> 00:49:55,150
it's,
you don't want to see that happening.

1095
00:49:55,270 --> 00:49:56,103
Um,
you've got to make government more 

1096
00:49:57,761 --> 00:49:58,594
efficient.
And you remember in the old days when 

1097
00:50:00,161 --> 00:50:01,300
you bought a kindle,
you know,

1098
00:50:01,301 --> 00:50:03,670
you had to pay money for it.
Now they'll pay you to have a kid.

1099
00:50:04,110 --> 00:50:04,943
No,
I mean we need to use creative and 21st 

1100
00:50:08,291 --> 00:50:13,240
century technology and techniques to 
skinny that government down to get it to

1101
00:50:13,241 --> 00:50:15,880
do what it's supposed to do and be 
efficient and effective.

1102
00:50:16,030 --> 00:50:16,863
You just said you can't believe what it 
was like for me to get permission to 

1103
00:50:19,781 --> 00:50:21,500
build a studio in my garage.
No,

1104
00:50:21,550 --> 00:50:23,800
that's nuts.
This is the 21st century.

1105
00:50:23,801 --> 00:50:25,250
What are they worried about?
Yeah,

1106
00:50:25,570 --> 00:50:26,830
and so,
you know,

1107
00:50:26,860 --> 00:50:29,480
I think that,
and I love California.

1108
00:50:29,540 --> 00:50:30,890
I mean,
are you kidding me?

1109
00:50:30,890 --> 00:50:33,710
I wanted to be out here.
I wanted a campaign out here,

1110
00:50:33,711 --> 00:50:35,900
but things move too fast.
I mean,

1111
00:50:35,990 --> 00:50:36,823
how could you not love this state,
but you can also do enough things to 

1112
00:50:40,311 --> 00:50:44,480
begin to drive people in businesses out 
in that it's not good.

1113
00:50:44,780 --> 00:50:45,613
All right,
well since you answered the big one 

1114
00:50:46,710 --> 00:50:47,201
already,
I'll,

1115
00:50:47,201 --> 00:50:50,390
I'll just give you a,
a wide one to bring us home with,

1116
00:50:50,420 --> 00:50:51,253
which would be so many emails that I get
tweets and messages that I get are all 

1117
00:50:54,591 --> 00:50:56,250
about people that are just afraid to 
look.

1118
00:50:56,300 --> 00:50:57,133
Can I go back for one second?
Because you were asking about these 

1119
00:51:00,400 --> 00:51:01,640
social issues.
Okay,

1120
00:51:02,690 --> 00:51:06,080
I read an article about Billy Graham who
was,

1121
00:51:06,110 --> 00:51:06,943
who spoke to 200 million people across 
the globe and he had fights with people 

1122
00:51:11,601 --> 00:51:16,160
inside of faith because he stayed away 
from the hot button social issues of the

1123
00:51:16,161 --> 00:51:18,710
time.
I think it is possible.

1124
00:51:18,770 --> 00:51:20,930
For example,
I'm dealing with guns right now.

1125
00:51:21,050 --> 00:51:21,883
Okay.
And I have brought a group of people 

1126
00:51:23,631 --> 00:51:24,464
together to mediate that.
I think you can deal with these social 

1127
00:51:27,651 --> 00:51:28,850
issues,
uh,

1128
00:51:28,880 --> 00:51:31,790
by being in a position of bringing 
people together at the end.

1129
00:51:31,791 --> 00:51:33,560
You may have to walk away from the 
table,

1130
00:51:33,890 --> 00:51:35,930
but I,
I admire with Billy Graham said,

1131
00:51:35,931 --> 00:51:38,150
there's so much negativity in the world 
today.

1132
00:51:38,420 --> 00:51:40,820
Why don't I like Billy Graham did well,
I don't,

1133
00:51:40,840 --> 00:51:44,600
I just focus on the positive things,
the uplifting things.

1134
00:51:44,750 --> 00:51:45,583
Instead of dragging yourself down into 
these ditches where we just go into 

1135
00:51:50,070 --> 00:51:53,900
warfare with world war one,
war for trench warfare,

1136
00:51:54,560 --> 00:51:56,930
it's not going to help us in the long 
run.

1137
00:51:56,931 --> 00:51:59,840
Those issues can be dealt with in a way 
and,

1138
00:52:00,030 --> 00:52:00,521
and,
and,

1139
00:52:00,521 --> 00:52:02,840
and on the edges.
But at the end,

1140
00:52:02,870 --> 00:52:07,870
let's try to lift our culture.
Casick 20 slash 20 politician.

1141
00:52:08,330 --> 00:52:08,990
What was it?

1142
00:52:08,990 --> 00:52:11,090
Philosopher slash gov.
I like that.

1143
00:52:11,091 --> 00:52:12,170
I see it all coming together.
All right,

1144
00:52:12,171 --> 00:52:13,004
so the final one though is that I get 
all of these messages and tweets and 

1145
00:52:16,071 --> 00:52:19,100
emails from people that are afraid to 
get involved.

1146
00:52:19,130 --> 00:52:19,963
They're just afraid to say what they 
think either because of political 

1147
00:52:22,461 --> 00:52:23,294
correctness or the way it's going to 
affect their job or their friends or 

1148
00:52:25,521 --> 00:52:27,350
anything.
You're obviously out there.

1149
00:52:27,351 --> 00:52:28,184
You're.
You're clearly not afraid to say what 

1150
00:52:29,361 --> 00:52:30,171
you think.
As I said,

1151
00:52:30,171 --> 00:52:31,004
there was no preparation.
You sat down and we did this for an 

1152
00:52:32,960 --> 00:52:34,400
hour.
What would you say to those young people

1153
00:52:34,401 --> 00:52:35,660
that want to look?
I mean,

1154
00:52:37,340 --> 00:52:42,340
life is short and life is also a 
journey.

1155
00:52:45,410 --> 00:52:50,090
You got to listen to your conscience and
sometimes it's hard.

1156
00:52:50,240 --> 00:52:54,410
Sometimes when you stand up,
sometimes you might lose something,

1157
00:52:54,440 --> 00:52:55,273
but in the long run you'll be admired 
and leave an indelible impression for 

1158
00:53:00,111 --> 00:53:04,070
showing courage.
Have people around you that you can talk

1159
00:53:04,071 --> 00:53:08,360
these things through because you know 
just doing it all yourself leads to self

1160
00:53:08,361 --> 00:53:11,570
righteous behavior that is not always 
very pretty,

1161
00:53:12,170 --> 00:53:15,320
but at the end,
look yourself in the mirror.

1162
00:53:16,550 --> 00:53:17,383
Look yourself in the mirror and I happen
to believe that there's a world yet to 

1163
00:53:21,291 --> 00:53:24,860
come that's really know how am I going 
into that one,

1164
00:53:24,861 --> 00:53:25,694
Huh?
But there's a world yet to come and I 

1165
00:53:27,301 --> 00:53:32,301
think our actions here prepare us for 
that world and it's going to be okay.

1166
00:53:33,810 --> 00:53:38,060
