1
00:00:05,060 --> 00:00:10,060
Joining me today is the milbank family 
centers senior fellow at the Hoover 

2
00:00:10,060 --> 00:00:13,691
Institution at Stanford University,
a senior fellow at the Center for 

3
00:00:13,691 --> 00:00:18,460
European studies at Harvard,
where he also served as a professor of 

4
00:00:18,460 --> 00:00:21,530
history for 12 years as well as the 
author of 14 books.

5
00:00:21,830 --> 00:00:23,690
Neil Ferguson.
Welcome to the Rubin report.

6
00:00:23,780 --> 00:00:26,990
It's exciting to be here.
How'd I do on the intro there?

7
00:00:26,991 --> 00:00:29,510
I mean I was looking through your bio.
14 books.

8
00:00:29,511 --> 00:00:32,450
There were 87 other things I could have 
credited you for.

9
00:00:32,451 --> 00:00:37,451
We've already done an interview here and
just the 15 minutes we've been sitting 

10
00:00:37,451 --> 00:00:37,451
here.
How was that all right.

11
00:00:37,451 --> 00:00:41,981
I mean I could have just made it quicker
the better as my feeling about 

12
00:00:41,981 --> 00:00:43,070
introductions just to said he is Neil.
All right.

13
00:00:43,220 --> 00:00:44,480
Here's Neil.
All right.

14
00:00:44,780 --> 00:00:49,780
There's a ton we got to cover here and 
we've already done half of it I think 

15
00:00:49,780 --> 00:00:51,320
without the cameras,
so let's just dive in immediately to the

16
00:00:51,321 --> 00:00:53,840
culture war stuff because I can tell 
you've been traveling a lot.

17
00:00:54,590 --> 00:00:56,480
Half jet lags,
half wide awake,

18
00:00:56,481 --> 00:00:59,030
but I can see that's really where your 
head's at at the moment.

19
00:00:59,630 --> 00:01:03,740
So let's talk some culture war stuff.
What do you feel is happening sort of in

20
00:01:03,741 --> 00:01:06,380
the gestalt of the universe at the 
moment?

21
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:11,800
We'll get started with the university 
might be where we should begin since 

22
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:13,250
I've spent a lot of my life in 
universities.

23
00:01:13,251 --> 00:01:15,950
You mentioned a couple of them,
the Stanford and Harvard.

24
00:01:15,951 --> 00:01:18,890
I was at Oxford before that and um,
much of my life has been,

25
00:01:19,550 --> 00:01:24,550
I think witnessing the gradual 
homogenization of academic life,

26
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:31,000
especially in the field like history 
when I became a historian back in the 19

27
00:01:31,521 --> 00:01:36,521
eighties in Oxford.
And then in Cambridge it was generally 

28
00:01:36,521 --> 00:01:40,961
accepted that that could be conservative
historians and liberal historians and 

29
00:01:40,961 --> 00:01:43,040
socialist historians.
And then some oxys stories.

30
00:01:43,070 --> 00:01:46,430
It was really quite a heterogeneous 
community.

31
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:47,810
Oxbridge in those days.

32
00:01:47,870 --> 00:01:48,950
And if you,
uh,

33
00:01:48,980 --> 00:01:53,980
as I was attracted to the Conservatives 
because they were more fun and it was a,

34
00:01:54,860 --> 00:01:56,010
either they say more,
right,

35
00:01:56,060 --> 00:01:58,940
but more fun.
But the fun was the initially attractive

36
00:01:58,941 --> 00:02:01,550
thing when I first got to Oxford in the 
early eighties.

37
00:02:01,790 --> 00:02:05,190
It was clearly at the funniest people 
where the riots,

38
00:02:05,910 --> 00:02:09,500
uh,
the young Andrew Sullivan who was a year

39
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:14,500
ahead of me at Moreland,
so this was all great fun and it led to 

40
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:14,760
intellectual,
uh,

41
00:02:14,900 --> 00:02:17,990
insight because they turned out all 
sorts of b writes,

42
00:02:17,991 --> 00:02:21,950
the historians take Bob Conquest who was
then at the hoover institution,

43
00:02:22,310 --> 00:02:27,310
one of the few historians who got the 
Soviet Union right at the time who wrote

44
00:02:27,951 --> 00:02:32,320
about Stalin's crimes not long after 
they were put up a tracy.

45
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:36,650
I mean,
those were the heroes of my early years,

46
00:02:37,190 --> 00:02:42,190
but in the course of my career,
what has happened has been that one 

47
00:02:42,190 --> 00:02:46,661
history department after another has 
moved steadily and relentless me to the 

48
00:02:48,231 --> 00:02:53,231
monochrome left and it has become 
steadily harder to be seen as a 

49
00:02:54,681 --> 00:02:55,370
conservative.

50
00:02:55,370 --> 00:03:00,370
I say CNS because I,
I've never really felt that I'm a 

51
00:03:00,370 --> 00:03:00,370
conservative,
but I've often been described as one.

52
00:03:00,370 --> 00:03:05,070
To be seen as a conservative historian 
has become steadily harder and harder 

53
00:03:05,070 --> 00:03:09,630
and as a result,
but culture war to use your phrase in 

54
00:03:09,630 --> 00:03:12,520
the universities has been won by the 
left.

55
00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:18,060
There will really be soon a handful left
of conservatives at institutions like 

56
00:03:19,481 --> 00:03:24,481
Harvard and Stanford and Harvey 
Mansfield will probably be the last one 

57
00:03:24,481 --> 00:03:25,250
at Harvard.
Uh,

58
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:27,010
and,
and that's,

59
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:28,870
uh,
to me deeply depressing,

60
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:33,960
deeply troubling.
Do you remember a moment when you saw 

61
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:34,170
that shift occurring because you're 
saying in the,

62
00:03:34,180 --> 00:03:35,500
in the eighties,
mid eighties,

63
00:03:35,501 --> 00:03:40,501
it was pretty diverse in terms of ideas.
Do you remember seeing something or did 

64
00:03:40,501 --> 00:03:45,331
you see markers that started that you 
can start putting together the map of 

65
00:03:45,331 --> 00:03:47,140
where this thing was going to go?
I think the definition of defeats in the

66
00:03:47,141 --> 00:03:49,880
culture war is that it's imperceptible,
uh,

67
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:51,040
your,
your aware of.

68
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:55,570
It's a little bit because in a typical 
department,

69
00:03:55,600 --> 00:04:00,600
each year somebody retires or dies,
but they're always replaced with 

70
00:04:01,511 --> 00:04:06,511
somebody working on that.
Say for the sake of argument,

71
00:04:06,790 --> 00:04:08,070
gender history.
So you,

72
00:04:08,170 --> 00:04:13,170
you'll colleague was a,
was lecturing on the history of the 

73
00:04:13,390 --> 00:04:18,390
Soviet Union.
Richard Pipes who was at Harvard and a 

74
00:04:18,390 --> 00:04:21,920
and just lately died,
one of the great historians of the 

75
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:26,430
Bolshevik revolution.
You don't ever see someone like that 

76
00:04:26,501 --> 00:04:31,501
replaced with somebody like him that'll 
always be replaced by somebody working 

77
00:04:32,020 --> 00:04:36,400
on gender history,
native American history that,

78
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:41,170
that process whereby there was no 
replacement of conservative historians,

79
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:46,440
was a more or less annual events.
I got accustomed to being in a real 

80
00:04:47,621 --> 00:04:50,740
minority,
a minority of conservative historians.

81
00:04:50,860 --> 00:04:54,310
I got accustomed to losing pretty much 
every vote.

82
00:04:54,970 --> 00:04:57,130
Being in the minority on every 
committee.

83
00:04:57,160 --> 00:05:00,960
It became a kind of you.
You've got to climatize to it.

84
00:05:00,961 --> 00:05:05,961
And then one day suddenly hit you that 
you were practically the last one left.

85
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:08,260
Uh,
and you know,

86
00:05:08,290 --> 00:05:11,080
when I moved to Stanford,
the revelation was quite startling.

87
00:05:11,770 --> 00:05:14,650
I was invited to come to the hoover 
institution,

88
00:05:14,890 --> 00:05:17,140
many hoover fellows who have 
associations,

89
00:05:17,530 --> 00:05:20,590
a joint appointments with Stanford 
departments.

90
00:05:21,010 --> 00:05:23,260
I had been pretty successful as a 
teacher at Harvard.

91
00:05:23,261 --> 00:05:25,510
My classes had been very large.
Uh,

92
00:05:25,511 --> 00:05:28,810
the students gave me very powerful 
evaluations.

93
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:34,120
Uh,
I kind of assumed that I would come to 

94
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:34,120
Stanford and have some relationship with
the history department.

95
00:05:34,290 --> 00:05:35,770
And then I was told,
oh,

96
00:05:35,771 --> 00:05:36,540
no,
no,

97
00:05:36,550 --> 00:05:39,070
none at all.
Not even a courtesy appointment.

98
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:45,000
And it was clear at that moment that I 
had become in the eyes of the Stanford 

99
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:48,280
History Department,
but a pariah,

100
00:05:48,310 --> 00:05:53,310
somebody who,
who simply couldn't be allowed in the 

101
00:05:53,310 --> 00:05:55,660
building because of my,
my conservative leanings.

102
00:05:56,290 --> 00:05:59,810
Can you explain little bit more about 
how the universities work like that,

103
00:06:00,330 --> 00:06:01,640
that,
that could even happen?

104
00:06:01,641 --> 00:06:03,260
They're going to,
they're going to bring you in,

105
00:06:03,261 --> 00:06:04,580
you're,
you're a fellow there,

106
00:06:04,581 --> 00:06:09,581
and that you're just going to be ignored
by the department that you're an expert 

107
00:06:09,581 --> 00:06:09,581
in.

108
00:06:09,581 --> 00:06:12,080
It's quite insulting,
especially as you mentioned,

109
00:06:12,730 --> 00:06:14,030
uh,
as I've published,

110
00:06:14,031 --> 00:06:19,031
rather,
there are lots of Buddhists rather more 

111
00:06:19,031 --> 00:06:21,641
than,
than most of the department put 

112
00:06:21,641 --> 00:06:23,930
together.
And I think,

113
00:06:23,931 --> 00:06:28,931
uh,
a department with falling enrollments 

114
00:06:28,931 --> 00:06:32,861
might have been expected to,
to want to have a me playing apart.

115
00:06:33,650 --> 00:06:38,650
But what happened is,
and it's happened in most departments 

116
00:06:38,650 --> 00:06:42,011
and most universities inexorably the 
left to Kovar and an implicit rule,

117
00:06:44,670 --> 00:06:48,650
tacit rule was imposed.
That one does not hire,

118
00:06:48,850 --> 00:06:53,850
right?
Leaning a historians know does one 

119
00:06:53,850 --> 00:06:54,170
higher.
They're graduate students.

120
00:06:54,230 --> 00:06:59,230
So the two people who have been my 
graduate students have found it 

121
00:06:59,230 --> 00:06:59,330
difficult,
uh,

122
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:03,020
to get hired.
So it's essentially a straightforward,

123
00:07:03,150 --> 00:07:08,150
a process whereby the institution has 
taken over one committee at a time and 

124
00:07:08,991 --> 00:07:12,050
the left has been good at that for the 
better part of a century.

125
00:07:12,051 --> 00:07:14,660
They've always.
How do you think they saw that?

126
00:07:14,690 --> 00:07:16,700
How did they have the foresight to go?
All right,

127
00:07:16,701 --> 00:07:19,460
we've got to take over the university's 
first.

128
00:07:19,490 --> 00:07:23,120
I think that on the right,
uh,

129
00:07:23,210 --> 00:07:28,210
the previous generation of historians,
and this was also true of philosophers 

130
00:07:28,210 --> 00:07:31,880
and people working in other fields did 
not fight very hard,

131
00:07:32,340 --> 00:07:37,340
uh,
or effectively to promote their 

132
00:07:37,340 --> 00:07:41,170
successes in academic life.
You need to be mindful of the 

133
00:07:41,170 --> 00:07:45,401
succession.
The left was better at ensuring that 

134
00:07:45,590 --> 00:07:50,590
it's proteges got the appointments.
Ultimately academia is a committee's 

135
00:07:50,661 --> 00:07:55,661
game.
It's all about getting to be the chair 

136
00:07:55,661 --> 00:07:56,660
of the department to be in charge of the
committees.

137
00:07:56,780 --> 00:07:59,270
If you control the process,
you control the selection,

138
00:07:59,271 --> 00:08:02,720
you control the recruitment.
And I suppose I'm,

139
00:08:03,140 --> 00:08:06,710
I'm such a naive person.
I kind of in my youth,

140
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:11,720
assumed we were in abroadly meritocratic
world in which if you were smart and 

141
00:08:12,141 --> 00:08:16,580
hardworking working then,
then good things would happen.

142
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:19,700
And it took me,
I was completely naive.

143
00:08:19,701 --> 00:08:22,490
It took me a while to cottoned onto the 
fact that in,

144
00:08:22,790 --> 00:08:25,850
in reality,
in academic life,

145
00:08:25,940 --> 00:08:30,940
as other walks of life,
patronage is everything and you can be 

146
00:08:30,950 --> 00:08:34,340
as talented as you like if you're not in
the right patronage network,

147
00:08:34,850 --> 00:08:39,850
then you're done.
And I suppose it's been thinking about 

148
00:08:39,850 --> 00:08:43,121
these issues,
how do networks capture institutions 

149
00:08:43,121 --> 00:08:46,830
that,
that led me to write the most recent 

150
00:08:46,830 --> 00:08:46,830
book,
the square and the tower,

151
00:08:46,830 --> 00:08:49,931
which is actually book number 15 to try 
to think about how networks operate.

152
00:08:50,980 --> 00:08:54,080
We,
we tend to talk casually about networks,

153
00:08:54,470 --> 00:08:57,930
but I came to realize that in academic 
life as another areas,

154
00:08:58,860 --> 00:09:03,180
you need to understand quite exactly 
quite precisely how networks operate.

155
00:09:03,210 --> 00:09:08,210
To see how power is truly wielded.
We can all see the hierarchical 

156
00:09:08,210 --> 00:09:10,560
institutions that are,
where power is located.

157
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Uh,
even universities are not as powerful 

158
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:16,000
as,
as governments,

159
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:20,240
but the critical point is to understand 
the disease often networks that capture 

160
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:21,410
institutions,
the capture the hierarchies.

161
00:09:21,420 --> 00:09:22,740
And that's what happened in academic 
life.

162
00:09:22,950 --> 00:09:27,950
And now I think pretty soon there just 
won't be conservatives in university 

163
00:09:27,991 --> 00:09:30,150
departments.
More importantly than that,

164
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:35,010
nobody will be teaching subjects like 
the history of the Soviet Union,

165
00:09:35,130 --> 00:09:40,130
so no students will be taught about the 
crimes of Lenin and Stalin and students 

166
00:09:42,390 --> 00:09:47,390
like the students I taught yesterday 
will not hear from inability that the 

167
00:09:48,091 --> 00:09:51,480
was a religious motivation to the nine 
slash 11 attacks.

168
00:09:52,110 --> 00:09:57,110
I had a class at Stanford just the day 
was allowed to sit in and teach somebody

169
00:09:57,361 --> 00:10:02,361
else's class as a guest professor.
And it happened to be a discussion about

170
00:10:03,481 --> 00:10:05,310
nine slash 11.
Uh,

171
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:11,120
and it became clear to me that the 
students had never considered the 

172
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:14,490
possibility that there was a religious 
motivation,

173
00:10:14,930 --> 00:10:18,660
uh,
to the nine slash 11 attacks and more or

174
00:10:18,661 --> 00:10:23,661
less accepted the idea that they were 
retaliation for the misdeeds of US 

175
00:10:23,661 --> 00:10:26,940
foreign policy in the Middle East,
what are called the Howard Zinn theory.

176
00:10:27,390 --> 00:10:32,390
And since Howard Zinn's books are more 
widely read in the United States than 

177
00:10:32,390 --> 00:10:36,171
anybody else's history books,
we therefore arrive at a situation in 

178
00:10:36,171 --> 00:10:40,590
which there will be nobody in any major 
university saying,

179
00:10:40,830 --> 00:10:42,900
actually,
Howard Zinn is completely wrong.

180
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:45,390
And this is not what nine slash 11 was 
about.

181
00:10:45,510 --> 00:10:50,430
So that's what I find depressing when I 
say that the culture was kind of over in

182
00:10:50,431 --> 00:10:51,930
the universities.
That's really what I mean.

183
00:10:52,060 --> 00:10:57,060
Yeah.
So let's circle back because it does 

184
00:10:57,060 --> 00:10:57,760
bring us to your 15th book.
I stand corrected.

185
00:10:58,080 --> 00:10:59,120
Um,
this,

186
00:10:59,230 --> 00:11:04,230
this idea of networks because we were 
talking right before we started that 

187
00:11:04,230 --> 00:11:07,860
there's something happening here with 
this loose association of people that 

188
00:11:08,531 --> 00:11:11,290
has been coined the intellectual,
dark web.

189
00:11:11,291 --> 00:11:13,810
And I said to you when you walked in,
are you part of the intellectual,

190
00:11:13,811 --> 00:11:17,440
dark web as if you were going to give me
a secret handshake or a special card?

191
00:11:17,441 --> 00:11:18,750
Or when I was asked about it,
I,

192
00:11:18,751 --> 00:11:23,751
I denied all knowledge.
The assumption that it was secret and 

193
00:11:23,751 --> 00:11:24,730
then it turned out to be all over the 
New York Times.

194
00:11:24,860 --> 00:11:26,290
Yeah.
So you weren't,

195
00:11:26,350 --> 00:11:28,660
you weren't photographed in the bushes 
like the rest of us,

196
00:11:28,661 --> 00:11:31,940
but I suspect that you secretly are in 
the intellectual,

197
00:11:31,941 --> 00:11:32,890
a dark web.
What?

198
00:11:32,891 --> 00:11:35,680
I couldn't possibly reveal that because 
it's secret.

199
00:11:36,490 --> 00:11:40,550
But you said something interesting about
because of your level of academic,

200
00:11:40,750 --> 00:11:45,430
sort of academic credit that you thought
perhaps that took you out of it,

201
00:11:45,431 --> 00:11:47,860
but then Christina Hoff summers said 
something interesting.

202
00:11:48,340 --> 00:11:49,430
You go from there.
What

203
00:11:49,810 --> 00:11:53,980
was it?
Emailed me and my wife Ayaan Hirsi Ali,

204
00:11:53,981 --> 00:11:57,010
who's been on your show is much more 
interesting than me,

205
00:11:57,011 --> 00:11:58,330
is the greatest.
I mean we.

206
00:11:58,390 --> 00:12:03,390
She must be tough for you because 
millions of people love your work and 

207
00:12:03,390 --> 00:12:04,920
everything else,
but it's like ion is like transcendence.

208
00:12:05,490 --> 00:12:10,490
She's one of the most enormous,
wonderful blessing in my life to be 

209
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:15,600
married to somebody who's just way more 
interesting than me that's not looking 

210
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:19,330
to so that.
So we were both asked my Barry Weiss,

211
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:22,300
the intellectual dark web,
and I'd said,

212
00:12:22,301 --> 00:12:27,301
look,
how can I really claim to be part of 

213
00:12:27,301 --> 00:12:27,301
that?
When I taught for 12 years at Harvard,

214
00:12:27,301 --> 00:12:29,560
left of my own volition,
I'm here at Stanford,

215
00:12:29,860 --> 00:12:34,210
can write newspaper columns and have 
them published more or less where I want

216
00:12:34,650 --> 00:12:39,650
it would.
It would be a little disingenuous to to 

217
00:12:39,650 --> 00:12:42,570
claim kinship with people like Bret 
Weinstein who've been persecuted by the 

218
00:12:43,211 --> 00:12:43,960
academic left.

219
00:12:43,990 --> 00:12:46,150
Now I've been attacked.
I've been criticized,

220
00:12:46,151 --> 00:12:48,280
but I haven't really been driven 
underground,

221
00:12:48,281 --> 00:12:53,281
at least not at this point,
but Christina Summers said to me just 

222
00:12:53,411 --> 00:12:54,630
the other night,
no,

223
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:58,360
it's not about whether you've been 
denied a platform or not.

224
00:12:58,390 --> 00:13:03,390
Clearly,
almost all the people in the article 

225
00:13:03,390 --> 00:13:06,151
that Barry wrote of have plenty of 
opportunities to make their views known.

226
00:13:06,550 --> 00:13:11,550
It's about whether you are seen to speak
for people who feel that they have been 

227
00:13:12,461 --> 00:13:17,461
silenced,
who feel that their voices aren't heard 

228
00:13:17,461 --> 00:13:20,010
night.
That's quite a good definition of what 

229
00:13:20,010 --> 00:13:20,010
this is about,
but you're also right to,

230
00:13:20,010 --> 00:13:20,860
to,
to see that it's a network.

231
00:13:21,340 --> 00:13:26,340
As I was reading the article,
I was thinking how funny I know all 

232
00:13:26,340 --> 00:13:29,461
these people.
I'm the sole exception of Jordan 

233
00:13:29,461 --> 00:13:29,461
Peterson,
who I've never.

234
00:13:29,461 --> 00:13:29,480
That um,
I,

235
00:13:29,590 --> 00:13:31,890
I sent that's coming.
Yeah,

236
00:13:32,230 --> 00:13:33,310
I hope so.
I look forward to it.

237
00:13:33,550 --> 00:13:34,550
Um,
but I,

238
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:37,090
I,
I think it's a network of the most,

239
00:13:37,140 --> 00:13:39,160
uh,
ideal sought.

240
00:13:39,310 --> 00:13:44,310
It is a truly informal network of people
from right across the political spectrum

241
00:13:45,371 --> 00:13:50,371
because nobody could call Bret Weinstein
of conservatives who have come together 

242
00:13:50,890 --> 00:13:53,080
spontaneously,
informally.

243
00:13:53,140 --> 00:13:58,030
Nobody called it into being and said,
I'm forming the intellectual dark web.

244
00:13:58,210 --> 00:13:59,860
Turn up on Monday at 5:00
PM.

245
00:14:00,710 --> 00:14:03,070
Change as it change the second it's 
name,

246
00:14:03,071 --> 00:14:05,770
generally a network.
So if this is the right type of network,

247
00:14:05,771 --> 00:14:06,520
right?
It's cool.

248
00:14:06,521 --> 00:14:11,521
Kind of diverse group of people who had 
all sorts of different motivations and 

249
00:14:11,521 --> 00:14:12,940
everything else.
Once it's sort of named,

250
00:14:13,690 --> 00:14:15,970
does that change the way a network has 
to operate?

251
00:14:15,971 --> 00:14:20,971
Because I sent.
That's what the discussion is about 

252
00:14:20,971 --> 00:14:20,971
right now.
Although I'm not not.

253
00:14:20,971 --> 00:14:24,631
I think fundamentally that the critical 
thing is when something ceases to be 

254
00:14:24,631 --> 00:14:26,620
secret.
I tell the story of the Illuminati,

255
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:31,760
a network in the late 18th century in 
Germany that sought to advance a radical

256
00:14:32,891 --> 00:14:37,120
version of the enlightenment,
but covertly as a secret organization.

257
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:42,720
The intellectual dark web I sent me 
seriously said was secrets until Barry 

258
00:14:44,501 --> 00:14:48,070
wrote that,
and now that it's out in the open,

259
00:14:48,071 --> 00:14:51,740
what will happen is that it will grow 
because people are Andrew Sullivan.

260
00:14:52,010 --> 00:14:54,930
I was discussing with him to said,
hmm,

261
00:14:54,950 --> 00:14:56,900
why am tiredness?
And of course the answer is,

262
00:14:57,210 --> 00:14:59,300
but you should be really,
I mean anybody who,

263
00:14:59,540 --> 00:15:04,540
who is engaged in critical thinking 
about the whole range of ideas in our 

264
00:15:06,051 --> 00:15:09,620
society,
ranging from the political to the social

265
00:15:09,621 --> 00:15:14,621
and cultural,
anybody who is in the debate and is 

266
00:15:14,621 --> 00:15:18,191
antagonistic to the dogmas of the left,
uh,

267
00:15:18,620 --> 00:15:21,860
the political correctness,
the identity politics,

268
00:15:21,980 --> 00:15:24,440
the spurious pursuit of so called social
justice.

269
00:15:24,740 --> 00:15:28,370
If you are skeptical,
if you are thinking critically about the

270
00:15:28,371 --> 00:15:31,840
dogmas of the left,
then you belong in the intellectual dark

271
00:15:31,841 --> 00:15:36,841
web because you're the kind of person 
who will at some point will be no 

272
00:15:36,841 --> 00:15:39,740
platformed,
who at some point will be taken down who

273
00:15:39,741 --> 00:15:42,800
at some point will be the target of a 
hit piece in the New York Times.

274
00:15:43,460 --> 00:15:48,460
One of the characteristic features of 
the intellectual dark whereby think is 

275
00:15:48,460 --> 00:15:51,911
that most members at one time or another
have fallen foul of the leftist thought 

276
00:15:52,761 --> 00:15:55,940
police and as soon as you've had that 
experience,

277
00:15:55,941 --> 00:15:59,990
it's happened to me a number of times 
that is quite transformative.

278
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:00,920
Yeah.
I mean,

279
00:16:00,921 --> 00:16:03,470
it literally changed my life.
It's the only reason you're sitting here

280
00:16:03,471 --> 00:16:06,680
right now.
I was once one of them and and I suspect

281
00:16:06,681 --> 00:16:11,681
that your experience was like mine.
You're kind of taken aback to be on the 

282
00:16:12,831 --> 00:16:17,831
receiving end of a social media mob.
You're kind of taken aback to be 

283
00:16:18,351 --> 00:16:23,351
attacked,
not for the substance of anything that 

284
00:16:23,351 --> 00:16:27,101
you've argued or written or said.
You're attacked for your reputation,

285
00:16:28,250 --> 00:16:31,340
you're attacked for your alleged bad 
faith,

286
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:34,300
and each time this has happened to me,
I've.

287
00:16:34,550 --> 00:16:38,060
I've been a little stunned.
I was naive.

288
00:16:38,270 --> 00:16:41,540
Not only was I a believer in 
meritocracy,

289
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:46,960
I was also a believer that we were 
engaged in a rational debate about the 

290
00:16:46,971 --> 00:16:47,390
past.

291
00:16:47,390 --> 00:16:52,390
That's what historians do a and that one
made ones case presented the evidence 

292
00:16:53,090 --> 00:16:57,680
and then the other side did the same,
but I wrote a book,

293
00:16:57,800 --> 00:17:00,110
a book about the British Empire.
Now what,

294
00:17:00,111 --> 00:17:03,230
15 or so years ago,
an argument.

295
00:17:03,231 --> 00:17:08,231
That argument of that book was that not 
everything about the British empire was 

296
00:17:08,231 --> 00:17:09,140
bad.
Then there are benefits as well as costs

297
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:14,440
to imperialism and I never had a debate 
about that argument.

298
00:17:15,110 --> 00:17:20,110
I only ever was attacked by the left for
being an apologist of empire and 

299
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:22,970
neocolonialist,
et Cetera.

300
00:17:23,330 --> 00:17:27,750
Uh,
and so in that curious debate that,

301
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:32,920
that is central to the culture war you 
never really are engaged with on the 

302
00:17:33,231 --> 00:17:38,231
ideas or the evidence it is always about
whether you have bad faith or not,

303
00:17:39,350 --> 00:17:41,720
whether you are covertly,
yeah,

304
00:17:41,810 --> 00:17:43,330
racist,
uh,

305
00:17:43,340 --> 00:17:48,340
an Islamaphobe,
a homophobe that there's a long list of 

306
00:17:48,340 --> 00:17:50,700
things that you can be accused of,
but are the most popular ones.

307
00:17:51,390 --> 00:17:54,810
Ones never really discussing the 
arguments of the books.

308
00:17:55,370 --> 00:17:57,990
One's always discussing the personality 
of the author.

309
00:17:58,050 --> 00:18:03,050
Yeah.
So this is just sort of simply put the 

310
00:18:03,050 --> 00:18:03,150
ideas verse people conversation.
Right?

311
00:18:03,151 --> 00:18:08,151
So in a case of a van,
I mean to live through the things that 

312
00:18:08,161 --> 00:18:13,161
she has lived through between fgm and 
her and her and her friend being 

313
00:18:13,161 --> 00:18:16,500
murdered and the whole thing to be 
called the things that she's called.

314
00:18:16,501 --> 00:18:17,640
I mean,
it flips,

315
00:18:17,940 --> 00:18:21,300
you're very personhood on its head,
which is.

316
00:18:22,100 --> 00:18:24,300
I mean it's,
it's so deeply twisted.

317
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:30,200
The episode that,
for me brought it into bold relief was 

318
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:33,740
the brandeis a honorary degree fiasco 
when I was invited by the president of 

319
00:18:35,161 --> 00:18:40,161
Brandeis and this was in 2017 to accept 
an honorary degree and speak at 

320
00:18:40,161 --> 00:18:40,590
commencement.
And then,

321
00:18:41,010 --> 00:18:46,010
uh,
was very publicly and humiliatingly 

322
00:18:46,010 --> 00:18:49,160
disinvited under pressure from an unholy
alliance as far as I could see of 

323
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:53,600
leftists and Islamicists who sets out 
online to smear her reputation with the 

324
00:18:55,411 --> 00:18:58,500
usual confection of selective quotation 
and,

325
00:18:58,580 --> 00:19:00,030
and misrepresentation.

326
00:19:00,270 --> 00:19:02,640
And as often happens in these 
situations,

327
00:19:02,641 --> 00:19:06,150
the university authorities capitulate 
without a fight,

328
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:09,350
uh,
to the left and,

329
00:19:09,430 --> 00:19:10,910
and they do it publicly.
And that,

330
00:19:10,911 --> 00:19:15,911
that for me was a,
that was a moment when I learned a lot 

331
00:19:15,911 --> 00:19:19,251
about what was going wrong in American 
academic life and realize that it's the 

332
00:19:19,251 --> 00:19:23,100
combination of,
of aggressive activists on the left,

333
00:19:23,270 --> 00:19:26,760
um,
and useful idiots in a university.

334
00:19:26,761 --> 00:19:28,540
Bureaucracies.
So fold it.

335
00:19:28,650 --> 00:19:31,290
Is it that they're useful idiots or is 
it just,

336
00:19:31,291 --> 00:19:36,291
is it just sort of blanket cowardice by 
on part of some of the academics,

337
00:19:37,050 --> 00:19:42,050
but really the,
the administrators and the upper brass 

338
00:19:42,050 --> 00:19:43,590
at all the schools.
And the fact that the donors,

339
00:19:43,591 --> 00:19:46,860
although this is changing right now,
and as we're taping this today,

340
00:19:46,861 --> 00:19:48,120
I know it's going to be out in a couple 
of days,

341
00:19:48,390 --> 00:19:50,940
um,
evergreen is now firing a whole bunch of

342
00:19:50,941 --> 00:19:53,190
professors,
which is exactly whatever what all of us

343
00:19:53,191 --> 00:19:58,191
predicted,
basically because the donors have just 

344
00:19:58,191 --> 00:19:58,191
had enough.

345
00:19:58,191 --> 00:19:59,790
It's fascinating.
So it's hard to figure out where does it

346
00:19:59,791 --> 00:20:00,570
come,
just coders.

347
00:20:00,571 --> 00:20:03,030
Coders is the most powerful force in 
human history,

348
00:20:03,060 --> 00:20:08,060
no doubt.
And I'm constantly amazed at just how 

349
00:20:08,060 --> 00:20:09,940
much cowardice is out there.
Uh,

350
00:20:10,410 --> 00:20:12,620
my wife's experience has shown me that 
the,

351
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:17,960
the,
the difficulty of getting people 

352
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:20,331
publicly to support her work against 
Islamic extremism is all about 

353
00:20:20,331 --> 00:20:23,610
cowardice,
fear of being in any way drawn into,

354
00:20:24,120 --> 00:20:25,770
into the,
the real war,

355
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:30,800
the jihad,
facing the death threats that she has 

356
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:32,070
repeatedly had to face.
But it's not just cowardice.

357
00:20:32,450 --> 00:20:37,450
And there's a good deal of complicity.
Many university administrators are 

358
00:20:37,450 --> 00:20:41,310
themselves ideologically on the left and
feel that they have a mission to empower

359
00:20:42,150 --> 00:20:45,550
the leftists in the student body.
Uh,

360
00:20:45,690 --> 00:20:47,590
and this is,
I think,

361
00:20:47,620 --> 00:20:50,890
a different thing from,
from covered this.

362
00:20:51,490 --> 00:20:52,500
So yeah,
I think,

363
00:20:52,780 --> 00:20:57,780
I think this is a fascinating moment in 
time because donors,

364
00:20:59,650 --> 00:21:02,890
alumni look at what is going on,
uh,

365
00:21:02,950 --> 00:21:07,480
on university campuses as do people who 
have not had the privilege of university

366
00:21:07,481 --> 00:21:11,380
education who see it almost complete 
madness and ask the question,

367
00:21:11,381 --> 00:21:12,730
what the hell is going on here?

368
00:21:12,730 --> 00:21:15,370
And I think the more that question gets 
asked,

369
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:20,400
the better,
but we should not underestimate the 

370
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:21,670
massive inertia in the system.
It is extremely hard.

371
00:21:21,730 --> 00:21:23,470
Even if you're a university president,
you say,

372
00:21:23,471 --> 00:21:24,640
right,
I'm going to clean house.

373
00:21:24,790 --> 00:21:27,550
It's really hard to do because they're 
all tenured.

374
00:21:27,551 --> 00:21:32,551
I mean the faculty is tenured.
It's hard to get what happened 

375
00:21:32,551 --> 00:21:32,551
everywhere.
You know what I mean?

376
00:21:32,551 --> 00:21:32,740
Like we don't find out,
you know,

377
00:21:32,930 --> 00:21:35,040
in the northeast it's a little bit 
better than,

378
00:21:35,041 --> 00:21:36,400
you know,
just even geographically,

379
00:21:36,401 --> 00:21:37,660
we just don't even see that.
Yes,

380
00:21:37,661 --> 00:21:42,661
there are bastions of freedom.
I've heard University of Chicago or a 

381
00:21:42,661 --> 00:21:43,270
couple of places are a little bit 
better,

382
00:21:43,271 --> 00:21:45,580
but how do you think it actually spread 
that way?

383
00:21:45,860 --> 00:21:50,860
That it wasn't just here and there and 
we'll this theory that universities are 

384
00:21:50,860 --> 00:21:52,170
always left wing,
but that's not true of,

385
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:57,240
for example,
if you had been in Germany in the 19 

386
00:21:57,240 --> 00:21:57,240
twenties,
uh,

387
00:21:57,240 --> 00:21:59,380
the universities were bastions of 
conservatism,

388
00:21:59,690 --> 00:22:02,350
a,
an extreme and indeed extreme right wing

389
00:22:02,351 --> 00:22:07,351
nationalism,
which is one reason that universities 

390
00:22:07,351 --> 00:22:08,410
very quickly went over to the Nazi 
regime when Hitler came to power.

391
00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:13,440
So it's,
there's no golden rule that says 

392
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:15,211
universities have to be left wing.
Oxford and Cambridge in 18th century 

393
00:22:15,211 --> 00:22:19,981
were extraordinary reactionary,
a fundamentally religious institutions 

394
00:22:19,981 --> 00:22:22,220
and deeply Tori with a few exceptions in
the,

395
00:22:22,330 --> 00:22:25,810
in the politics.
So there's no rule rule here.

396
00:22:26,140 --> 00:22:29,410
Uh,
I think the best explanation I can offer

397
00:22:29,411 --> 00:22:34,411
you is a process of generational capture
of education institutions dating from 

398
00:22:35,441 --> 00:22:40,120
the 19 sixties universities in let's 
take the elite universities,

399
00:22:40,121 --> 00:22:43,210
the Ivy League universities in the 19 
fifties.

400
00:22:43,211 --> 00:22:47,160
We're already seen as being liberal.
Um,

401
00:22:47,350 --> 00:22:52,350
and if you were a kind of mccarthy 
leaning Republican,

402
00:22:52,570 --> 00:22:57,570
you already knew that Harvard was likely
full of fellow travelers and a covert 

403
00:22:59,411 --> 00:23:02,710
commies.
But the real shift I think came later.

404
00:23:02,770 --> 00:23:07,770
I think it came with the antiwar 
protests of the late sixties and early 

405
00:23:07,770 --> 00:23:11,341
seventies,
the more radical baby boomers who were 

406
00:23:11,341 --> 00:23:13,390
protesting in the campuses and 68 and 
into the early seventies.

407
00:23:13,810 --> 00:23:18,280
It grew up to become professors and 
they're still around.

408
00:23:18,550 --> 00:23:23,550
Uh,
and I think that generation which was 

409
00:23:23,550 --> 00:23:25,120
essentially formed at the time of the 
antiwar protests,

410
00:23:25,540 --> 00:23:29,140
successfully replicated itself.
They were very,

411
00:23:29,141 --> 00:23:34,141
very good at replicating themselves by 
creating graduate students in their own 

412
00:23:34,421 --> 00:23:36,700
image and then making sure that those 
graduates,

413
00:23:36,701 --> 00:23:40,240
students got jobs and,
and the right was nowhere.

414
00:23:40,330 --> 00:23:42,250
So you were,
you were out there writing books,

415
00:23:42,251 --> 00:23:46,120
doing research and figuring.
All right,

416
00:23:46,420 --> 00:23:51,420
they're doing that.
And maybe in the long run on my heroes 

417
00:23:51,420 --> 00:23:55,210
at Oxford and Cambridge who,
who wrote great books and we're also 

418
00:23:55,210 --> 00:23:59,080
politically active people like norman 
stone or Roger Scruton who did much of 

419
00:23:59,601 --> 00:24:01,130
the thinking that,
uh,

420
00:24:01,610 --> 00:24:04,940
that accompanied that tourism in the 19 
eighties.

421
00:24:05,330 --> 00:24:07,970
What they did not do well was academic 
politics.

422
00:24:08,030 --> 00:24:09,590
They were poor it that,
uh,

423
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:13,400
they were poor at succession planning.
And that is,

424
00:24:13,401 --> 00:24:15,500
I think,
the best explanation I can offer for the

425
00:24:15,501 --> 00:24:18,920
fact that in nearly all universities in 
North America and in Europe,

426
00:24:19,190 --> 00:24:24,190
90 percent plus of faculty members are 
Liberals or progressives,

427
00:24:24,290 --> 00:24:26,000
if not outright Marxists.

428
00:24:26,120 --> 00:24:31,120
Alright?
So with some of the historical context 

429
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:33,461
of how this all happened,
I know you are enthused about this new 

430
00:24:33,461 --> 00:24:34,970
network idea and because it's come 
around the right way,

431
00:24:35,210 --> 00:24:40,210
do you think there's a gatekeeping 
responsibility for whoever is involved 

432
00:24:40,210 --> 00:24:44,471
in this?
This seems to be one of the hot button 

433
00:24:44,471 --> 00:24:45,710
issues with this thing are who can be in
this?

434
00:24:45,711 --> 00:24:50,711
Whatever it is,
what are the ideas that can not be on 

435
00:24:50,711 --> 00:24:50,711
the inside?
Uh,

436
00:24:50,711 --> 00:24:54,680
I see it coming much more that we have 
to watch out for ideas on the right than

437
00:24:54,681 --> 00:24:59,681
on the left.
That seems to be the way it's being 

438
00:24:59,681 --> 00:24:59,681
framed,
at least from where I sit.

439
00:24:59,681 --> 00:25:01,050
Um,
how would you do that in a,

440
00:25:01,140 --> 00:25:03,780
in a proper network monitoring?
Two kinds of,

441
00:25:03,850 --> 00:25:06,200
of,
of net was open access networks.

442
00:25:06,760 --> 00:25:11,760
Let's take the example of facebook where
you can just join up an open a facebook 

443
00:25:11,841 --> 00:25:12,380
account.

444
00:25:12,380 --> 00:25:15,110
You can even do it as a fake human 
being,

445
00:25:15,950 --> 00:25:18,770
and then there are the restricted access
networks,

446
00:25:19,070 --> 00:25:21,290
uh,
extreme cases,

447
00:25:21,530 --> 00:25:26,530
the secret societies of a,
of the 18th and 19th century don't 

448
00:25:26,530 --> 00:25:30,641
really have many analogs today because 
it's hard to do anything secret in 

449
00:25:30,641 --> 00:25:33,800
barely exists any anymore in the age of,
of Wiki leaks.

450
00:25:34,040 --> 00:25:39,040
So you have to decide whether to be an 
open or closed or restricted access 

451
00:25:39,260 --> 00:25:41,960
network and the minute you are 
restricted access network,

452
00:25:41,990 --> 00:25:46,420
somebody is making the decisions about 
who joins that then ends up being the,

453
00:25:46,470 --> 00:25:51,470
the,
the membership committee and then you 

454
00:25:51,470 --> 00:25:51,470
were just a club.
Really.

455
00:25:51,470 --> 00:25:53,630
I don't think that's an option in our 
time.

456
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:57,230
I think an open access networks,
the only real way to go,

457
00:25:57,640 --> 00:26:00,110
um,
and you must accept that if the,

458
00:26:00,111 --> 00:26:02,900
uh,
if the intellectual dot webb is real,

459
00:26:03,260 --> 00:26:08,260
that it's an open access network that,
that won't necessarily connect you to 

460
00:26:08,781 --> 00:26:13,781
ever really,
that you want to be connected to a may 

461
00:26:13,781 --> 00:26:16,241
connect you to people that you 
positively don't want to be connected 

462
00:26:16,241 --> 00:26:16,241
to.

463
00:26:16,241 --> 00:26:18,110
This has been a central problem I think 
of uh,

464
00:26:18,770 --> 00:26:21,980
being on the political right for a long 
time.

465
00:26:22,820 --> 00:26:26,510
I can remember in the 19 eighties when 
people said to me,

466
00:26:26,570 --> 00:26:26,960
well,
Neil,

467
00:26:26,961 --> 00:26:29,540
you're a conservative,
and I would say,

468
00:26:29,541 --> 00:26:34,541
well,
I'm actually not a member of the 

469
00:26:34,541 --> 00:26:37,120
Conservative Party.
I think of myself as a classical 

470
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:37,120
liberal.
They would say,

471
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:37,120
oh,
but nevertheless,

472
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:38,630
when I look at all the things you say 
you were a conservative,

473
00:26:38,631 --> 00:26:40,220
and then I would think,
what does that mean?

474
00:26:40,221 --> 00:26:43,130
That I have to have dinner with the 
likes of,

475
00:26:43,500 --> 00:26:46,620
I would think of various egregious 
conservative members of parliament.

476
00:26:47,670 --> 00:26:52,670
And it was as if you would be associated
with those people even if you never had 

477
00:26:52,670 --> 00:26:57,230
dinner with them.
And it's the same problem now except 

478
00:26:57,230 --> 00:27:00,051
that it's,
it's worse now because the way in which 

479
00:27:00,051 --> 00:27:01,710
the left seeks to discredit it.
Uh,

480
00:27:01,830 --> 00:27:05,370
you,
Jordan Peterson and probably me as well.

481
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:09,470
Now that I'm on your show man,
I mean 15.

482
00:27:10,770 --> 00:27:15,770
Look at the people who are connected to 
these people who quote these people or 

483
00:27:16,950 --> 00:27:21,480
who read the books that there they are 
over there,

484
00:27:21,810 --> 00:27:24,400
but terrible alt right.
And you know,

485
00:27:24,750 --> 00:27:25,860
when you say,
all right,

486
00:27:26,390 --> 00:27:30,540
the audience is supposed to start booing
and hissing and you know,

487
00:27:30,541 --> 00:27:34,670
Steve Bannon is supposed to appear in a 
black robe with a sife.

488
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:35,850
You know,
I am deaf.

489
00:27:35,970 --> 00:27:40,970
So I think that the problem is,
I think in escapable there will be a 

490
00:27:40,970 --> 00:27:43,830
constant effort on the left to say that,
uh,

491
00:27:43,831 --> 00:27:48,831
the,
the intellectual dark web is just some 

492
00:27:48,831 --> 00:27:50,520
kind of a facade in front of a hideous 
outright,

493
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:54,660
which is composed of remember racists,
Islamophobes,

494
00:27:54,780 --> 00:27:58,110
homophobes,
and that will be the culture was next,

495
00:27:58,111 --> 00:27:59,490
right?
I mean that is how it works.

496
00:27:59,491 --> 00:28:03,810
We have a strange amount of gay people 
and Muslim people and absolutely.

497
00:28:04,290 --> 00:28:09,290
There you go.
Otherwise Brown people and every other 

498
00:28:09,290 --> 00:28:09,290
type of thing.
And the self,

499
00:28:09,290 --> 00:28:13,490
the self hating phenomenon,
the left has long known how to say that 

500
00:28:13,490 --> 00:28:16,560
it is absolutely typical of the wicked,
right?

501
00:28:16,590 --> 00:28:20,490
That they should have lured into that,
to the side,

502
00:28:20,820 --> 00:28:23,640
a self hating.
And then you just fill in the blank.

503
00:28:23,641 --> 00:28:27,480
Self hating Muslims self hating gays.
That's how this works.

504
00:28:27,990 --> 00:28:32,990
Remember they lost all the arguments.
All they've got left is reputational 

505
00:28:32,990 --> 00:28:35,760
smearing man.
We got to fight in front of us.

506
00:28:35,770 --> 00:28:36,660
Huh?
You know,

507
00:28:36,700 --> 00:28:39,390
I,
I have lost sleep about this.

508
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:44,220
Not only because people threatened my 
wife's life.

509
00:28:44,221 --> 00:28:49,221
That's the real war that the war against
the Islamic extremists is.

510
00:28:49,771 --> 00:28:53,100
No is no mere culture wards and actual 
war.

511
00:28:53,770 --> 00:28:58,550
I've also lost sleep about the media 
culture war at the prospect of,

512
00:28:59,130 --> 00:29:01,770
of the reputational attacks.
It's,

513
00:29:02,280 --> 00:29:07,280
it's never pleasant to be attacked as I 
was recently in effect for being a,

514
00:29:11,170 --> 00:29:16,170
I guess a sexist,
racist or a racist sexist because I'd 

515
00:29:16,170 --> 00:29:16,380
organized a conference at which all the 
speakers,

516
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:21,960
uh,
were white men because the women are 

517
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:25,700
invited,
couldn't come back.

518
00:29:25,890 --> 00:29:28,400
It was a private conference,
wasn't supposed to,

519
00:29:28,430 --> 00:29:30,900
it wasn't.
He was kind of informal discussion about

520
00:29:30,901 --> 00:29:35,901
how we could take the idea of applied 
history and make history more relevant 

521
00:29:37,441 --> 00:29:42,441
to some of the debates that go on.
I think a lot of what has done in 

522
00:29:42,441 --> 00:29:45,840
academic history these days is not 
really relevant to anything terribly 

523
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:48,811
much,
but this event was a rather crudely 

524
00:29:48,911 --> 00:29:51,760
exposed in the New York Times and the 
Washington Post,

525
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:57,320
uh,
the pictures of the speakers were 

526
00:29:57,320 --> 00:29:59,730
published as if the mugshots as it 
appeared in the New York Times.

527
00:30:00,760 --> 00:30:04,270
And the implication was that I must be a
terrible racist,

528
00:30:04,271 --> 00:30:09,271
sexist,
or sexist racist for having organized 

529
00:30:09,271 --> 00:30:11,461
such a conference.
I did lose sleep about that.

530
00:30:12,180 --> 00:30:13,600
Uh,
and I,

531
00:30:13,670 --> 00:30:18,670
I think that part of the culture war is 
really is really odious because it is,

532
00:30:20,380 --> 00:30:24,760
it is calculated to discredit it,
uh,

533
00:30:25,150 --> 00:30:28,570
the targeted individuals.
And it is,

534
00:30:28,810 --> 00:30:33,760
it's bad faith on the part of the people
who launched those attacks.

535
00:30:33,850 --> 00:30:38,850
So in my view,
what's happening with some of those 

536
00:30:38,850 --> 00:30:40,840
gated institutions when the newspapers 
that used to be objective,

537
00:30:41,260 --> 00:30:46,260
you know,
Barry wrote this piece in the New York 

538
00:30:46,260 --> 00:30:46,260
Times that I think was a pretty fair 
piece.

539
00:30:46,260 --> 00:30:48,190
It was even somewhat critical of me and 
I'm not above criticism,

540
00:30:48,191 --> 00:30:51,010
so I'm certainly okay with that.
But then just a week later,

541
00:30:51,011 --> 00:30:56,011
we see this awful piece about Jordan and
enforced monogamy and it's just 

542
00:30:56,011 --> 00:30:57,700
nonsense.
It's just nonsense.

543
00:30:57,701 --> 00:31:02,701
And you know,
I'm on tour with him right now and he 

544
00:31:02,701 --> 00:31:04,201
keeps explaining why that's,
of course he doesn't want anyone to be 

545
00:31:04,201 --> 00:31:05,800
forced to do anything and all that.
He's talking about marriage in effect.

546
00:31:05,980 --> 00:31:06,580
Um,
and,

547
00:31:06,581 --> 00:31:10,300
and Eric Weinstein,
our friend found two other references in

548
00:31:10,301 --> 00:31:15,301
the history of the New York Times where 
they talked about enforcement I'll give 

549
00:31:15,301 --> 00:31:16,030
me and they were both positive relative 
to progressive ideals.

550
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:17,590
So it's like they flip everything on its
head.

551
00:31:17,591 --> 00:31:18,910
But what do you think happened there?
I mean,

552
00:31:18,911 --> 00:31:22,480
you're giving me a pretty good layout of
what's happened at the academic side,

553
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:25,360
but on the media side and those,
those gates,

554
00:31:25,750 --> 00:31:30,750
what is going on?
I spent a lot of my life doing 

555
00:31:30,750 --> 00:31:33,380
journalism because I didn't have any,
uh,

556
00:31:33,520 --> 00:31:38,520
inherited money.
And being an academic in Britain in the 

557
00:31:38,520 --> 00:31:39,520
19 eighties and nineties wasn't terribly
lucrative.

558
00:31:39,521 --> 00:31:44,521
So I kept body and soul together,
even from my graduate years writing for 

559
00:31:45,041 --> 00:31:46,630
newspapers,
uh,

560
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:52,440
uh,
newspapers have had their own 

561
00:31:52,440 --> 00:31:54,010
transformation in the course of my adult
life.

562
00:31:54,370 --> 00:31:57,760
A part of that sister economics,
as we all know,

563
00:31:57,761 --> 00:32:02,761
the business model which essentially 
revolved around advertising has been 

564
00:32:02,761 --> 00:32:05,941
annihilated by the combination of Google
and facebook and these institutions are 

565
00:32:05,941 --> 00:32:10,501
in some measure in desperation trying to
reinvent themselves for the Internet age

566
00:32:10,541 --> 00:32:15,541
and everybody's in pursuit of clickbait.
Even the gray lady,

567
00:32:16,001 --> 00:32:18,970
even the most illustrious of,
of newspapers.

568
00:32:18,971 --> 00:32:23,971
And I think that's one explanation.
The other explanation is that an 

569
00:32:23,971 --> 00:32:27,250
institution like the New York Times has 
its own university,

570
00:32:27,251 --> 00:32:30,280
like character behaves a little bit like
university.

571
00:32:30,530 --> 00:32:35,530
The most self important newspapers if 
you go to them are rather like colleges.

572
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:39,010
And it's also true of the Financial 
Times,

573
00:32:39,020 --> 00:32:42,560
which is that like a kind of Cambridge 
college that sort of ended up by mistake

574
00:32:42,561 --> 00:32:47,561
in London.
And so they have some of the same 

575
00:32:47,561 --> 00:32:47,561
dynamics as,
as universities.

576
00:32:47,870 --> 00:32:50,330
And I think that's especially true of 
the New York Times.

577
00:32:50,380 --> 00:32:55,380
Also true of the BBC incidentally.
So institutions like the times and the 

578
00:32:55,380 --> 00:32:59,141
BBC are think of themselves as being 
liberal bastions,

579
00:33:00,410 --> 00:33:04,730
but for them liberalism is truth.
It's the same problem at Harvard has,

580
00:33:04,760 --> 00:33:06,800
if you,
if your motto is Veritas,

581
00:33:07,130 --> 00:33:12,130
but you translate that into liberalism,
then by definition conservatives and 

582
00:33:12,130 --> 00:33:16,561
must be untruth and so I think there's a
tendency and it's there and in the New 

583
00:33:16,820 --> 00:33:21,820
York Times periodically to lash out 
against anyone like Jordan Peterson who 

584
00:33:21,820 --> 00:33:24,050
dissents from liberal orthodoxy.
Remember,

585
00:33:24,680 --> 00:33:29,150
part of what we're dealing here with is 
a kind of quiz I religious phenomenon.

586
00:33:29,690 --> 00:33:34,690
The dogmas of the left have become more 
and more religious in their quality as 

587
00:33:36,411 --> 00:33:41,411
they have been unmerge from that 
fundamental economic rationality which 

588
00:33:41,961 --> 00:33:46,460
was at the heart of Marxism when that 
all went down in flames in 1989,

589
00:33:46,461 --> 00:33:51,461
the left decamped to the realm of 
culture and as it did that it 

590
00:33:51,461 --> 00:33:54,000
increasingly to on the form of a cult,
a good.

591
00:33:54,320 --> 00:33:59,320
Let me illustrate what I mean.
Colts defined themselves partly by a 

592
00:33:59,320 --> 00:34:01,670
belief in a lot of things that are 
slightly weird.

593
00:34:02,120 --> 00:34:07,120
In order to be an account,
you have to have some weird beliefs and 

594
00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:10,001
one good example of a weird belief is 
that sexuality is entirely constructed 

595
00:34:10,001 --> 00:34:13,790
socially and is not biologically rooted 
and you can actually have any gender you

596
00:34:13,791 --> 00:34:17,600
like and there are actually multiple 
genders now that's absurd,

597
00:34:18,260 --> 00:34:23,260
but to believe it has become a kind of 
test of your orthodoxy.

598
00:34:24,940 --> 00:34:26,010
Uh,
and,

599
00:34:26,100 --> 00:34:31,100
and,
and one sees this at meetings are in 

600
00:34:31,100 --> 00:34:34,451
academia in which people introduce 
themselves by name and by their 

601
00:34:34,451 --> 00:34:35,570
preferred pronouns.
Now,

602
00:34:35,571 --> 00:34:40,571
when this first happened to me,
my immediate reaction was introduced 

603
00:34:40,571 --> 00:34:41,090
myself and say that my preferred 
pronouns were,

604
00:34:41,180 --> 00:34:46,180
it restrain myself because I realized 
that my sense of humor forged as it was 

605
00:34:47,391 --> 00:34:51,380
in Scotland in the 19 seventies is now 
almost entirely politically incorrect.

606
00:34:51,381 --> 00:34:54,830
And anything that I consider funny will 
get me into trouble.

607
00:34:55,280 --> 00:35:00,280
But that has gone on in the media too.
And the other thing that's happened is 

608
00:35:00,280 --> 00:35:04,481
that the polarization which 
characterizes a network society is now 

609
00:35:05,360 --> 00:35:10,360
very visibly there in the realm of 
newspapers and cable television.

610
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:13,700
One thing that we all got wrong about 
the internet,

611
00:35:13,880 --> 00:35:16,670
because we hadn't really thought much 
about network science,

612
00:35:16,850 --> 00:35:19,460
was that we just assumed that if 
everybody was connected,

613
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:22,790
everything would be awesome and that was
the kind of mantra of Silicon Valley for

614
00:35:22,791 --> 00:35:26,840
about 20 years,
but no network science tells you that if

615
00:35:26,841 --> 00:35:29,420
you build a social network,
even quite a small one,

616
00:35:29,900 --> 00:35:34,900
there will be something called homophily
because birds of a feather flock 

617
00:35:34,900 --> 00:35:36,140
together on bet you already.

618
00:35:36,470 --> 00:35:40,950
That the intellectual dark web has two 
clusters that are somewhat separate from

619
00:35:40,951 --> 00:35:45,951
one another.
I sense it happening right now 

620
00:35:45,951 --> 00:35:45,951
immediately,
and that's what happened in the media.

621
00:35:45,951 --> 00:35:49,740
So as society became more polarized 
politically,

622
00:35:49,741 --> 00:35:54,741
so to to the media,
I think that's an issue that is one of 

623
00:35:54,741 --> 00:35:58,071
the defining characteristics of our age.
The polarization or if you like self 

624
00:35:58,231 --> 00:36:03,231
segregation that we see online is 
translated into almost every realm of 

625
00:36:03,231 --> 00:36:04,980
life.
Can there be any positives out of that,

626
00:36:05,580 --> 00:36:10,580
out of that self selection,
into finding groups that you're more in 

627
00:36:10,580 --> 00:36:10,580
common with

628
00:36:10,580 --> 00:36:12,260
that for at least for a certain period 
of time.

629
00:36:12,261 --> 00:36:17,261
There's some goodness there because you 
can really sort of get into your ideas 

630
00:36:17,261 --> 00:36:19,790
enough to maybe leave the group then and
take those ideas out.

631
00:36:20,360 --> 00:36:23,930
I think if you are in what you want to 
call it,

632
00:36:23,931 --> 00:36:28,931
the echo chamber or the filter bubble,
if you are in a cluster that cuts you 

633
00:36:28,931 --> 00:36:33,401
off from a contrary ideas,
you'll last.

634
00:36:34,510 --> 00:36:37,160
Yeah.
What was fun about being in a network of

635
00:36:37,190 --> 00:36:39,680
right leaning undergraduates in early 19
eighties?

636
00:36:39,681 --> 00:36:44,681
Oxford was the.
We're in constant combat with the left 

637
00:36:44,681 --> 00:36:48,271
leaning Marxist that was still real.
Marxist is then and we weren't far from 

638
00:36:49,581 --> 00:36:54,581
cut off constantly engaging with them 
and the soggies Social Democrats in in 

639
00:36:55,341 --> 00:36:57,650
the middle and that was what made it 
interesting.

640
00:36:58,310 --> 00:37:03,310
What I see happening in the networked 
age is that people can retreat into a 

641
00:37:03,560 --> 00:37:08,540
realm of confirmation bias where they 
here only things that are similar to the

642
00:37:08,541 --> 00:37:13,541
things they liked yesterday and the 
algorithms are the key here where you 

643
00:37:13,541 --> 00:37:18,071
are,
whether it's youtube or on facebook or 

644
00:37:18,071 --> 00:37:18,470
on twitter,
you are essentially going to be fed more

645
00:37:18,471 --> 00:37:19,790
of what you already liked.

646
00:37:20,180 --> 00:37:25,180
That's deeply intellectually unhealthy.
Just as a university cannot be a 

647
00:37:25,180 --> 00:37:29,540
university if everybody agrees about 
first ideological principles because how

648
00:37:29,541 --> 00:37:31,580
can you have critical thinking in that 
environment?

649
00:37:31,910 --> 00:37:36,440
So it's unhealthy for any intellectual 
network to be Autarkic.

650
00:37:36,620 --> 00:37:41,620
So the one thing the intellectual dark 
web must not do is cut itself off from 

651
00:37:42,350 --> 00:37:46,710
other networks,
including the ones that hate us and when

652
00:37:46,711 --> 00:37:51,410
we have to be in an argument and we have
to have our minds constantly open to the

653
00:37:51,411 --> 00:37:53,870
possibility that we're wrong about some 
things.

654
00:37:53,990 --> 00:37:57,260
And that's what I see more or less 
disappearing from public life.

655
00:37:57,920 --> 00:38:00,010
I recognize this at one time,
uh,

656
00:38:00,110 --> 00:38:01,010
when I was in,
in,

657
00:38:01,060 --> 00:38:06,020
in mortal combat with Paul Krugman,
the economists turned journalist and,

658
00:38:06,110 --> 00:38:09,260
and realize that recruitment could never
admit that he'd ever been wrong.

659
00:38:09,530 --> 00:38:14,530
And then when it was obvious that he had
been because he hit his part of his 

660
00:38:14,530 --> 00:38:18,871
result,
Dettra was always being right about 

661
00:38:18,871 --> 00:38:18,871
everything.

662
00:38:18,871 --> 00:38:19,600
Did you happen to see the day that the 
article came out,

663
00:38:19,601 --> 00:38:22,330
the original intellectual,
dark web article by Barry?

664
00:38:22,331 --> 00:38:27,331
The day that that came out that Paul 
Krugman tweeted it and he tweeted this 

665
00:38:27,331 --> 00:38:27,460
thing about how we're also oppressed,
you know,

666
00:38:27,461 --> 00:38:32,461
just mocking everybody basically,
and then a bunch of us responded to him 

667
00:38:32,461 --> 00:38:34,450
and I of course retweeted it and invited
them on the show.

668
00:38:34,451 --> 00:38:39,451
I said I'd be to discuss this,
you and it gets a couple thousand 

669
00:38:39,451 --> 00:38:39,451
retweets,
but of course,

670
00:38:39,451 --> 00:38:39,451
no response.
Right?

671
00:38:39,580 --> 00:38:44,580
And that you're right.
That's what we have to make sure we 

672
00:38:44,580 --> 00:38:44,580
don't become,
but I think there's a,

673
00:38:44,580 --> 00:38:46,840
uh,
there's a human trait that would sort of

674
00:38:46,841 --> 00:38:51,841
make you want to retreat because it's 
exhausting having your motives attack.

675
00:38:52,691 --> 00:38:57,691
Then your humanity attacked and lies and
smears and all the things that I don't 

676
00:38:57,691 --> 00:38:59,860
see anyone on this side doing.
I don't.

677
00:39:00,230 --> 00:39:01,300
And,
and that's an example.

678
00:39:01,320 --> 00:39:04,750
So it's an exhausting fight because 
we're fighting two different battles.

679
00:39:05,110 --> 00:39:07,650
Yes.
Supposedly the same trick

680
00:39:07,650 --> 00:39:12,650
award at the moment in the sense that we
haven't recognized that in the culture 

681
00:39:12,650 --> 00:39:17,001
war.
The only thing that works is 

682
00:39:17,001 --> 00:39:17,040
reputational destruction.
I think we,

683
00:39:17,100 --> 00:39:19,620
we are guaranteed sleepless nights.
Remember,

684
00:39:19,621 --> 00:39:22,830
there's also the phenomenon of guilty 
until proven innocent,

685
00:39:23,130 --> 00:39:28,050
which is insidious and means that if the
reputational hit is bad enough,

686
00:39:28,740 --> 00:39:30,610
there may be no,
uh,

687
00:39:30,660 --> 00:39:35,660
there may be no recovery from that.
I was very struck by the speed with 

688
00:39:35,701 --> 00:39:40,701
which reputations were destroyed in the,
the me two movements,

689
00:39:41,080 --> 00:39:46,080
uh,
most violent phase a and a 

690
00:39:46,080 --> 00:39:51,051
characteristic feature of the process 
seemed to be the men were essentially 

691
00:39:51,091 --> 00:39:56,091
guilty until proven innocent and crimes 
were conflated with a quite clearly 

692
00:39:58,531 --> 00:40:03,531
noncriminal behavior in ways that were 
deeply troubling to my eyes.

693
00:40:04,890 --> 00:40:07,380
The false accusation is,
of course the,

694
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:12,760
the ultimate nightmare of anybody in 
this world at this time,

695
00:40:12,811 --> 00:40:15,830
because if you're falsely accused,
uh,

696
00:40:15,900 --> 00:40:20,900
well,
your reputation can be gone in 24 hours 

697
00:40:20,900 --> 00:40:24,230
and that,
that has an emt introduced into our 

698
00:40:24,230 --> 00:40:27,570
lives something that hasn't really 
existed since medieval times.

699
00:40:28,050 --> 00:40:33,050
Uh,
the feeling that we are at the mercy of 

700
00:40:33,050 --> 00:40:35,611
what wheel of fortune that can 
arbitrarily turn against us and dashes 

701
00:40:36,270 --> 00:40:41,160
overturn us.
I think this makes the culture war,

702
00:40:41,610 --> 00:40:45,360
uh,
a deeply troubling thing to be a part of

703
00:40:45,690 --> 00:40:50,690
and most sensible normal people say,
God,

704
00:40:51,270 --> 00:40:56,270
I want a quiet life.
Get me out of here and never involved me

705
00:40:57,390 --> 00:41:00,600
in any of this.
Get me off twitter,

706
00:41:01,140 --> 00:41:05,790
get me off facebook.
Never let my name appear in the New York

707
00:41:05,791 --> 00:41:08,940
Times.
Never let me appear on a,

708
00:41:09,060 --> 00:41:12,840
on a show like this because it's just 
too dangerous.

709
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:16,560
Uh,
I only need to say one thing that can be

710
00:41:16,561 --> 00:41:21,561
taken out of context and represented as 
heresy or hate speech as heresy is now 

711
00:41:21,561 --> 00:41:26,361
called [inaudible].
That's what we now call heresy and I 

712
00:41:26,361 --> 00:41:29,391
will be subjected to potentially a weeks
of vilification and maybe worse,

713
00:41:30,390 --> 00:41:33,530
maybe the vilification will actually 
lead me to lose my job at.

714
00:41:33,590 --> 00:41:35,810
People are right to be fearful of that.

715
00:41:36,500 --> 00:41:41,500
One of the things that Eric,
who I mentioned before we had dinner 

716
00:41:41,500 --> 00:41:41,620
with and,
and just to illustrate this,

717
00:41:41,621 --> 00:41:42,910
I'm sure you don't even want me to say 
this,

718
00:41:42,911 --> 00:41:45,280
but just to illustrate the level of what
we're talking about.

719
00:41:45,290 --> 00:41:50,290
We had a private dinner in a home with 
Eric and his wife and I and you and me 

720
00:41:50,891 --> 00:41:51,920
and my husband,
and we had.

721
00:41:51,970 --> 00:41:54,220
There were security guards out outside,
so you're not.

722
00:41:54,270 --> 00:41:56,160
You're not just saying this stuff like 
this is.

723
00:41:56,560 --> 00:42:01,560
This is real stuff,
but what Eric has said to me is that 

724
00:42:01,560 --> 00:42:03,130
it's exactly what you're saying,
that there's a bravery element here that

725
00:42:03,131 --> 00:42:04,780
I don't even consider.
I don't consider myself.

726
00:42:04,781 --> 00:42:06,820
I don't know what I'm just doing what I 
think is right,

727
00:42:06,821 --> 00:42:09,640
that that really is the truth,
but I want to ask you about that.

728
00:42:09,641 --> 00:42:11,260
So.
So for you,

729
00:42:11,261 --> 00:42:13,600
for ion,
it's not just academic.

730
00:42:13,601 --> 00:42:16,090
Where do you think the bravery comes in 
for you?

731
00:42:16,190 --> 00:42:21,190
Because I can tell there is nothing that
I could possibly ask you here that you 

732
00:42:21,190 --> 00:42:24,331
wouldn't give me the clearest honest 
answer and and that isn't always how it 

733
00:42:24,331 --> 00:42:25,180
is with everybody.
Obviously.

734
00:42:25,181 --> 00:42:28,140
As an interviewer,
where do you think that comes from?

735
00:42:28,170 --> 00:42:31,030
Uganda has always been one of my 
greatest weaknesses.

736
00:42:32,380 --> 00:42:32,890
I think

737
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:39,960
I was probably brought up in a rather 
combative family in a rather competence 

738
00:42:41,051 --> 00:42:42,200
parts of the world.
I grew up in,

739
00:42:42,250 --> 00:42:44,020
in Glasgow,
in the west of Scotland,

740
00:42:44,080 --> 00:42:44,650
and

741
00:42:45,210 --> 00:42:47,520
to a physician and a,
and a physics.

742
00:42:47,670 --> 00:42:49,290
That's right.
My mother was a teacher.

743
00:42:49,291 --> 00:42:54,291
My father was a doctor and they were the
first in their families to go to 

744
00:42:54,421 --> 00:42:55,770
university.
Uh,

745
00:42:55,890 --> 00:43:00,890
my grandfathers had served in the world,
was a scots,

746
00:43:01,681 --> 00:43:05,550
have a self image of themselves as being
a courageous.

747
00:43:06,090 --> 00:43:09,120
The Scottish regiments were famous.
I wrote about this in my,

748
00:43:09,330 --> 00:43:14,330
one of my earliest books,
the prisoner of war were famously the 

749
00:43:14,330 --> 00:43:15,000
sharp end of,
of the British military.

750
00:43:15,160 --> 00:43:19,890
Uh,
we marched towards the sound of gunfire,

751
00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:24,140
bagpipes playing.
That's the self image that a,

752
00:43:24,360 --> 00:43:29,360
a small Scottish boy growing up in the 
19 sixties and seventies was encouraged 

753
00:43:29,360 --> 00:43:33,651
to have.
I remember vividly the day that nine 

754
00:43:34,351 --> 00:43:37,530
slash 11 happened.
I was sitting in Oxford where I was then

755
00:43:37,531 --> 00:43:42,531
teaching,
but planning I'd planned and was 

756
00:43:42,531 --> 00:43:45,021
intending to fly to New York a very 
shortly to give a lecture on nine slash 

757
00:43:45,391 --> 00:43:47,940
12 at New York University.

758
00:43:48,650 --> 00:43:53,650
Indeed,
I was booked into a hotel very close to 

759
00:43:53,650 --> 00:43:56,750
the World Trade Center and my response 
when I saw the attacks was somewhat a 

760
00:43:59,750 --> 00:44:04,750
bloody minded.
My response was very shortly afterwards 

761
00:44:04,750 --> 00:44:07,860
to resign my posts at Oxford and go to 
New York University,

762
00:44:07,890 --> 00:44:12,890
and I taught there for two years in a,
I suppose a mood of defiance that the 

763
00:44:15,061 --> 00:44:18,030
attempt to terrorize would not terrorize
me.

764
00:44:18,780 --> 00:44:23,780
When I met a on a nine more than nine 
years ago now,

765
00:44:24,900 --> 00:44:29,610
it never crossed my mind as I fell in 
love with her,

766
00:44:29,611 --> 00:44:34,611
which happened very fast,
that this implied some meaningful,

767
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:41,000
a threat to my person.
Even when the FBI came to tell me that 

768
00:44:42,061 --> 00:44:47,061
there had been a threat against me,
something that I'd seen them due to a 

769
00:44:47,061 --> 00:44:50,721
yarn on more than one occasion.
I never gave it a second thought because

770
00:44:52,350 --> 00:44:57,350
obviously my calling different from my 
grandfathers who were called to fight in

771
00:44:58,861 --> 00:44:59,760
real wars.

772
00:45:00,630 --> 00:45:05,630
My more,
much more manageable callings to is to 

773
00:45:05,630 --> 00:45:10,551
protect her.
But she's one of the great heroines of 

774
00:45:10,551 --> 00:45:14,361
our time.
Extraordinary courageous woman who's 

775
00:45:14,361 --> 00:45:17,781
been through a hell of a lot and who is 
never shirked from saying what she 

776
00:45:19,891 --> 00:45:24,891
believes is wrong with modern Islam,
so it,

777
00:45:26,070 --> 00:45:30,390
it is second nature to me to be there 
with her in that,

778
00:45:30,690 --> 00:45:32,280
in that fight,
in that war.

779
00:45:32,281 --> 00:45:34,500
That's what it turns out to be.
My warm.

780
00:45:34,680 --> 00:45:36,600
I always used to wonder as I was growing
up,

781
00:45:36,601 --> 00:45:41,601
why is it that my generation isn't 
really been called on to fight wars the 

782
00:45:41,601 --> 00:45:43,650
way my grandfather's generations were 
called on,

783
00:45:43,680 --> 00:45:45,750
and then it turned up.
Then my water turned up.

784
00:45:47,580 --> 00:45:50,910
You briefly mentioned this earlier when 
you were talking about ion and brandeis,

785
00:45:50,911 --> 00:45:55,911
but can you explain this intersection of
Islamism and the left?

786
00:45:57,601 --> 00:45:59,550
How,
why this has occurred.

787
00:45:59,820 --> 00:46:03,330
This confuses a lot of people.
This idea of the oppression Olympics and

788
00:46:03,620 --> 00:46:05,370
you know,
I've got plenty of theories on this that

789
00:46:05,371 --> 00:46:06,170
we've knocked out,
but,

790
00:46:06,171 --> 00:46:11,171
but what do you think it is that has 
attracted something that is completely 

791
00:46:11,171 --> 00:46:14,530
totalitarian and control with another 
thing that's so completely totally.

792
00:46:14,531 --> 00:46:16,080
I mean,
I guess that's the answer right there,

793
00:46:16,110 --> 00:46:16,350
but.

794
00:46:16,570 --> 00:46:19,300
Well,
there are many unholy alliances in,

795
00:46:19,360 --> 00:46:20,740
in history.
And,

796
00:46:20,800 --> 00:46:21,880
uh,
no,

797
00:46:21,881 --> 00:46:23,470
don't,
many people will gravely,

798
00:46:24,240 --> 00:46:29,240
uh,
surprised when the Ribbentrop Molotov 

799
00:46:29,240 --> 00:46:31,870
pact was announced in the Soviet Union 
and Nazi Germany,

800
00:46:31,871 --> 00:46:36,871
you formed an alliance.
So we shouldn't be entirely surprised 

801
00:46:36,871 --> 00:46:40,321
when seemingly odd bedfellows jump into 
bed in the case of the Islamists and the

802
00:46:45,640 --> 00:46:50,640
left,
I think it's pretty clear to me that the

803
00:46:51,230 --> 00:46:54,280
Islam,
this are the,

804
00:46:54,580 --> 00:46:59,580
the leading partner and the leftists 
have broadly the useful idiots because 

805
00:47:01,481 --> 00:47:06,481
the Islamists have a strategy.
It's bare and Muslim Brotherhood and 

806
00:47:06,481 --> 00:47:10,501
other documents for expanding their 
network in the west.

807
00:47:14,260 --> 00:47:19,260
And part of the strategy is the kind of 
a partnership that they have formed on 

808
00:47:21,671 --> 00:47:24,580
campuses against,
uh,

809
00:47:24,760 --> 00:47:29,760
against their foes.
One way in which this is that you use 

810
00:47:31,210 --> 00:47:33,420
the issue of Israel,
uh,

811
00:47:33,820 --> 00:47:38,820
to forge the packs with the left.
So you get the left's longstanding 

812
00:47:39,130 --> 00:47:42,130
animosity towards Zionism,
uh,

813
00:47:42,180 --> 00:47:43,870
and you essentially say,
well,

814
00:47:43,871 --> 00:47:45,760
we entirely agree with you about that.

815
00:47:45,760 --> 00:47:50,760
Let's,
let's have an event about how wicked 

816
00:47:50,760 --> 00:47:53,580
Israel is a.
and so that's the gateway drug into 

817
00:47:53,580 --> 00:47:58,081
accepting.
The next thing is well headscarves or 

818
00:47:58,081 --> 00:47:58,360
actually empowering for women.
Don't you think?

819
00:47:58,640 --> 00:48:03,640
A and isn't actually Islamophobia to be 
in any way critical of sharia law.

820
00:48:04,420 --> 00:48:09,420
So you play the multiculturalists 
cultural relativist card and you again 

821
00:48:10,090 --> 00:48:13,570
depict any critics of radical Islam as 
it is in fact,

822
00:48:13,910 --> 00:48:18,910
uh,
engaged in some kind of orientalist 

823
00:48:18,910 --> 00:48:22,171
project,
a or essentialist project to other 

824
00:48:22,171 --> 00:48:23,500
people always talk about othering in 
academia,

825
00:48:23,890 --> 00:48:28,890
uh,
Muslims and you blur the distinction 

826
00:48:28,890 --> 00:48:29,650
between Islam,
Islam,

827
00:48:29,651 --> 00:48:34,651
Islam and Muslims as people.
So this has been going on for awhile and

828
00:48:35,740 --> 00:48:39,000
the left as broadly fallen for it and 
it,

829
00:48:39,040 --> 00:48:40,480
to me,
it's just astonishing.

830
00:48:40,481 --> 00:48:42,640
I remember looking at the list of 
academics who had,

831
00:48:43,060 --> 00:48:47,230
who had argued that they aren't,
should not receive an honorary degree at

832
00:48:47,231 --> 00:48:52,231
Brandeis,
and it included professors of Queer 

833
00:48:52,231 --> 00:48:53,950
Studies,
a female professors of gender studies.

834
00:48:53,980 --> 00:48:58,980
It's incredible.
You kind of feel like saying to these 

835
00:48:58,980 --> 00:49:01,291
people,
have you taken a look at what the Muslim

836
00:49:01,510 --> 00:49:05,130
Brotherhood envisages have you read 
works?

837
00:49:05,190 --> 00:49:10,190
Do you realize that the project is the 
permanent demotion of women to second 

838
00:49:10,571 --> 00:49:15,130
class status and potentially a capital 
punishment for gays?

839
00:49:15,550 --> 00:49:20,550
Is that something you are aware of?
And I can only conclude that they aren't

840
00:49:21,101 --> 00:49:26,101
aware of it.
And have been very thoroughly duped as 

841
00:49:26,101 --> 00:49:26,200
useful.
Idiots usually are.

842
00:49:26,440 --> 00:49:30,340
So is that basically because both of 
these movements wind power,

843
00:49:30,341 --> 00:49:35,341
so the useful idiot part of this is that
Islam is a really just using the left 

844
00:49:35,341 --> 00:49:39,901
who attain power and they're doing it 
all in the name of diversity and all of 

845
00:49:39,901 --> 00:49:39,901
these things.
And eventually,

846
00:49:39,901 --> 00:49:43,290
once that power is attained,
then for lack of a better expression,

847
00:49:43,310 --> 00:49:48,310
I mean,
you basically decapitate them and then 

848
00:49:48,310 --> 00:49:48,310
you've got,
they did it for you.

849
00:49:48,310 --> 00:49:48,730
They did the work for you.
Yes.

850
00:49:48,731 --> 00:49:52,390
I mean,
I always used to joke with a on that,

851
00:49:52,420 --> 00:49:54,220
uh,
when we lived in Cambridge,

852
00:49:54,221 --> 00:49:59,221
it would be fun if all my enemies and 
all her enemies came and protested 

853
00:49:59,471 --> 00:50:04,471
outside our house together because after
about 20 minutes and they'd fall on one 

854
00:50:05,591 --> 00:50:08,050
another and they would have the most 
tremendous fight.

855
00:50:08,800 --> 00:50:13,800
I do think that power is part of it,
but if one looks back at the history of 

856
00:50:15,160 --> 00:50:20,080
another intolerant to Talla Terry and 
ideology of Marxism,

857
00:50:21,290 --> 00:50:25,220
that there's a combination of power and 
a,

858
00:50:25,440 --> 00:50:30,440
a kind of idealism.
One must call it that in the square and 

859
00:50:30,591 --> 00:50:35,591
the tower.
I tell the story of how the Soviet 

860
00:50:35,591 --> 00:50:37,751
successfully penetrated the British 
establishment by recruiting spies and 

861
00:50:39,141 --> 00:50:44,141
Cambridge and the people they recruited 
had leanings to the left that were 

862
00:50:44,781 --> 00:50:49,781
inspired partly by revulsion at those 
aspects of of British imperialism or 

863
00:50:50,260 --> 00:50:55,260
British society,
that word in many ways a legitimately 

864
00:50:56,240 --> 00:50:57,470
open to criticism.

865
00:50:57,800 --> 00:51:02,660
There was an idealism there at the 
beginning of guide Burgess's involvement

866
00:51:02,661 --> 00:51:05,930
in Marxism,
sympathy with workers during the time of

867
00:51:05,931 --> 00:51:10,931
the Great Depression,
but those were the useful idiots that 

868
00:51:10,931 --> 00:51:12,890
the Soviet cynically recruited to be 
spies who,

869
00:51:12,950 --> 00:51:17,950
whom they persuaded to betray their 
countrymen in what was the single most 

870
00:51:17,950 --> 00:51:22,451
successful act of of Russian espionage,
of the mobile recruiting.

871
00:51:23,030 --> 00:51:27,320
These highly educated people from an 
credibly exclusive network,

872
00:51:27,321 --> 00:51:31,730
the Cambridge Apostles and the related 
network that led to Bloomsburg.

873
00:51:31,880 --> 00:51:36,880
This was a brilliant strategy.
Something similar is going on here 

874
00:51:36,880 --> 00:51:40,810
because I think there are a great many 
naive young people who are drawn to the 

875
00:51:40,911 --> 00:51:43,700
rhetoric of social justice.
I encountered them often.

876
00:51:44,060 --> 00:51:45,320
People who say,
oh,

877
00:51:45,470 --> 00:51:50,470
there should be limits on free speech 
because I don't want such and such a 

878
00:51:50,470 --> 00:51:52,400
such and such as feelings to be hurt.
They're naive,

879
00:51:52,790 --> 00:51:57,790
they have a very naive view,
somehow there can be a circumscribed 

880
00:51:57,790 --> 00:52:00,020
form of free speech and no in which 
nobody's feelings get hurt.

881
00:52:00,530 --> 00:52:05,530
That's not the pursuit of power.
That's just naive city and the people 

882
00:52:05,530 --> 00:52:10,511
who know how to explain that naive 30 
are both people amongst the Islamists 

883
00:52:10,511 --> 00:52:12,830
and people amongst the leftists who are 
pursuing power,

884
00:52:13,250 --> 00:52:18,250
but you can never really get to power 
without the useful idiots without the 

885
00:52:18,250 --> 00:52:21,530
naive idealists who think that they're 
going to build utopia with your help.

886
00:52:21,730 --> 00:52:23,600
Yeah,
and I don't have to tell you,

887
00:52:23,601 --> 00:52:25,880
they're usually ends up in Dystopia,
right?

888
00:52:26,050 --> 00:52:27,890
So that,
that's,

889
00:52:28,140 --> 00:52:31,850
that's something that it's hard to 
persuade people of y'all keep reflecting

890
00:52:31,851 --> 00:52:36,851
on the curious revival of,
of Margaret Atwood's the handmaid's 

891
00:52:36,851 --> 00:52:41,230
tale,
which is always taken to be a vision of 

892
00:52:41,230 --> 00:52:43,480
what happens when right wing people,
uh,

893
00:52:43,690 --> 00:52:45,920
take over America.
And to me,

894
00:52:45,921 --> 00:52:50,921
the amazing thing that is almost never 
observed is that something very like 

895
00:52:51,230 --> 00:52:53,060
this has happened.
Uh,

896
00:52:53,270 --> 00:52:58,270
it happened in Iran after 1979 and it 
happened after the Taliban came to power

897
00:52:58,461 --> 00:52:59,360
in Afghanistan.

898
00:52:59,780 --> 00:53:04,640
So we don't need to fantasize about 
crazy evangelical fascists turning women

899
00:53:04,880 --> 00:53:07,730
into baby machines.
This has already happened,

900
00:53:07,880 --> 00:53:12,880
but it was done by Islam as it was done 
by people pursuing an extreme version 

901
00:53:13,071 --> 00:53:13,400
of,
of,

902
00:53:13,540 --> 00:53:17,510
of Sharia.
And yet almost nobody who enthuses about

903
00:53:17,960 --> 00:53:22,960
Margaret Atwood's book realizes that it 
is actually really quite powerful 

904
00:53:22,960 --> 00:53:27,611
realization of what a theocratic Islam 
this regime does to women.

905
00:53:28,520 --> 00:53:33,520
All right,
so I want to shift gears a little bit 

906
00:53:33,520 --> 00:53:33,520
here and we can either.
I'm going to let you choose.

907
00:53:33,520 --> 00:53:36,090
We can either go the historical root or 
we can go to the president route.

908
00:53:36,230 --> 00:53:38,970
What are you feeling first?
I do want to do both.

909
00:53:39,600 --> 00:53:44,600
I think the key to apply to history,
which is what I've spent my whole life 

910
00:53:44,600 --> 00:53:45,780
doing,
is that you do both and you can't do one

911
00:53:45,781 --> 00:53:48,900
without the other because no,
you could have no real insight about the

912
00:53:48,901 --> 00:53:50,130
present without the past.

913
00:53:50,430 --> 00:53:55,430
So why don't we talk about the president
and I'll try to show why to understand 

914
00:53:55,430 --> 00:53:56,010
that you need history.
All right,

915
00:53:56,011 --> 00:53:57,090
very good.
So,

916
00:53:57,200 --> 00:54:02,200
uh,
there are a couple of things that are 

917
00:54:02,200 --> 00:54:03,981
interesting that you've staked out 
positions out over the past couple of 

918
00:54:03,981 --> 00:54:03,981
years.
Uh,

919
00:54:03,981 --> 00:54:04,680
we briefly,
right before we sat down,

920
00:54:04,681 --> 00:54:09,450
we talked about brexit for a second.
So you originally were for,

921
00:54:09,550 --> 00:54:10,610
were against brexit.
Yeah.

922
00:54:11,250 --> 00:54:16,250
Then you came around for it.
Now it seems to be in this odd limbo 

923
00:54:16,250 --> 00:54:18,240
that I think unfortunately most people 
in America don't even understand what's,

924
00:54:18,570 --> 00:54:20,310
what's going on.
I don't think most people in Britain,

925
00:54:21,210 --> 00:54:22,840
I'm sure.
Um,

926
00:54:23,070 --> 00:54:24,710
so when I was reading your position on 
this,

927
00:54:24,740 --> 00:54:25,740
at first I thought,
well,

928
00:54:25,741 --> 00:54:30,741
wait a minute as a,
as a conservative and as someone that 

929
00:54:30,741 --> 00:54:32,130
wants some autonomy over his country,
I was somewhat surprised actually,

930
00:54:32,370 --> 00:54:37,370
that you weren't for it originally.
So can you explain to your original 

931
00:54:37,370 --> 00:54:37,370
position and then how you changed on it?

932
00:54:38,020 --> 00:54:43,020
The two reasons why I was on the side of
remain remain in the EU,

933
00:54:43,550 --> 00:54:45,090
uh,
back in 2016.

934
00:54:45,450 --> 00:54:49,930
One was pure personal loyalty to friends
up.

935
00:54:50,130 --> 00:54:55,130
David Cameron was prime minister.
George Osborne was chancellor of the 

936
00:54:55,130 --> 00:54:55,130
Exchequer and they,
uh,

937
00:54:55,130 --> 00:54:59,660
friends of mine and I,
I felt obliged as a friend to support 

938
00:54:59,941 --> 00:55:04,941
them when they decided to stick with the
EU or not to recommend brexit.

939
00:55:06,490 --> 00:55:11,490
Did that friendship supersede what your 
feelings were or was that because you 

940
00:55:11,490 --> 00:55:12,630
really trusted what they could get into?
Swung it.

941
00:55:12,660 --> 00:55:17,660
Okay.
And I think the reason that I was 

942
00:55:17,660 --> 00:55:20,300
willing to,
to get on board with Romaine was that I 

943
00:55:20,300 --> 00:55:22,950
found the arguments of the brexiteers 
deeply unconvincing.

944
00:55:24,030 --> 00:55:28,380
I remember one night sitting down and 
reading a lot of stuff by Daniel Hannan,

945
00:55:28,590 --> 00:55:31,150
one of the advocates of,
uh,

946
00:55:31,440 --> 00:55:36,440
of leaving.
And I remember thinking that this was 

947
00:55:36,440 --> 00:55:39,471
just intellectually completely a foot 
class and unconvincing the,

948
00:55:40,230 --> 00:55:45,230
the notion that Britain would be better 
off economically outside the European 

949
00:55:45,230 --> 00:55:49,330
Union wouldn't have passed muster as a,
an undergraduate paper,

950
00:55:49,340 --> 00:55:50,730
another undergraduate paper.

951
00:55:51,150 --> 00:55:56,150
So I felt that the brexiteers case 
failed intellectually because they were 

952
00:55:56,671 --> 00:56:01,671
claiming implausibly.
I thought that you could have a free 

953
00:56:01,671 --> 00:56:05,781
lunch,
that you could leave the European Union 

954
00:56:05,781 --> 00:56:07,611
and be better off.
And that just seems to me to be 

955
00:56:07,611 --> 00:56:10,311
intellectually completely deceitful.
I think it would have been harder for me

956
00:56:10,860 --> 00:56:12,420
if they had said,
honestly,

957
00:56:12,720 --> 00:56:17,720
this is going to cost quite a bit,
but it's worth it because if we leave 

958
00:56:20,070 --> 00:56:25,070
then we shall have the ability to 
control our borders and we shall have a 

959
00:56:28,330 --> 00:56:33,330
autonomy at a time when Europe is 
pursuing a federalists course.

960
00:56:34,480 --> 00:56:39,480
But that wasn't the argument.
The argument was that not the argument 

961
00:56:39,480 --> 00:56:40,810
here,
Wednesday get the money.

962
00:56:41,050 --> 00:56:43,750
This was the argument you had to get the
money that we give to the European Union

963
00:56:43,810 --> 00:56:48,810
and we're going to be able to spend on 
the national health service because we 

964
00:56:48,810 --> 00:56:48,810
will be in fact better off.

965
00:56:48,810 --> 00:56:50,620
And that was a lie and I'm not good with
lies.

966
00:56:50,830 --> 00:56:53,230
It was a clever line.
It worked politically.

967
00:56:53,530 --> 00:56:58,530
And I give credit to Dominic Cummings 
for crafting a message that was a pd 

968
00:56:58,530 --> 00:56:59,590
both to conservatives and to Labor 
voters.

969
00:56:59,830 --> 00:57:01,900
The Conservatives got immigration 
control,

970
00:57:01,910 --> 00:57:04,030
Labor voters got the national health 
service,

971
00:57:04,031 --> 00:57:06,220
gets the money.
So this is brilliant politically,

972
00:57:06,221 --> 00:57:08,380
but it wasn't mendacious I think at 
heart.

973
00:57:08,410 --> 00:57:13,410
And so I,
I opposed the brexit when it happened.

974
00:57:15,320 --> 00:57:20,320
Uh,
what struck me in the subsequent months 

975
00:57:20,530 --> 00:57:25,530
was that while I had been one,
I had been on the side that last,

976
00:57:27,670 --> 00:57:32,670
there was a good reason why we lost and 
the good reason was that we went around 

977
00:57:33,520 --> 00:57:36,460
saying how much it was going to cost and
I think we were right about that.

978
00:57:36,520 --> 00:57:38,890
I think ultimately at least some of what
the Treasury said,

979
00:57:38,930 --> 00:57:41,920
well will turn out to be true about the 
cost,

980
00:57:42,700 --> 00:57:46,850
but that wasn't what people cared about.
And when you went into pubs as I did in,

981
00:57:46,930 --> 00:57:48,910
in,
in Wales and England and in Scotland,

982
00:57:50,020 --> 00:57:55,020
there was a question to which you could 
not give an honest answer without losing

983
00:57:55,241 --> 00:57:57,940
the debate.
And I'll tell you what that question was

984
00:57:58,420 --> 00:58:03,420
because I was asked it multiple times.
You'd make the case about the cost.

985
00:58:03,850 --> 00:58:05,680
Nobody was interested in the cost.
They would say,

986
00:58:05,681 --> 00:58:10,360
listen Neil,
about the one point 3 million Muslims,

987
00:58:10,361 --> 00:58:14,470
the Germans have just let in to Germany 
because that had just happened.

988
00:58:15,790 --> 00:58:17,830
If the Germans give them German 
passports,

989
00:58:17,831 --> 00:58:18,670
can they come here?

990
00:58:20,360 --> 00:58:22,970
And the only honest answer to that 
question was yes.

991
00:58:25,020 --> 00:58:30,020
So immigration was the issue.
And I think for a significant number of 

992
00:58:30,601 --> 00:58:35,220
people in England and Wales especially 
was less so in Scotland where brexit was

993
00:58:35,221 --> 00:58:35,760
defeated.

994
00:58:37,290 --> 00:58:42,290
The realization was that Britain had 
lost control of immigration.

995
00:58:44,910 --> 00:58:49,910
The people had been promised net 
migration in the tens of thousands in 

996
00:58:49,910 --> 00:58:51,810
the 19 nineties under the Blair 
government,

997
00:58:52,320 --> 00:58:55,290
and they'd ended up with net migration 
and the hundreds of thousands,

998
00:58:55,590 --> 00:59:00,590
they saw the chaos in Germany.
They saw the waves of migration coming 

999
00:59:00,901 --> 00:59:03,790
on in different Syria,
but from all over North Africa and uh,

1000
00:59:03,791 --> 00:59:05,910
and even so Asia.
And they said,

1001
00:59:05,911 --> 00:59:07,740
and I remember David Cameron using this 
phrase,

1002
00:59:07,890 --> 00:59:10,710
get me out of here.
And that was,

1003
00:59:11,370 --> 00:59:14,250
that was the driving motivation for the 
brexit vote.

1004
00:59:14,310 --> 00:59:19,310
And I think it was legitimate because I 
think that Anglia Merkle had made a 

1005
00:59:19,310 --> 00:59:20,970
catastrophic mistake and throwing open 
the gates.

1006
00:59:21,050 --> 00:59:24,890
I think it will have consequences for 
the future of Germany and of Europe.

1007
00:59:25,280 --> 00:59:30,280
And I do not blame British voters for 
saying forget about the cost of brexit.

1008
00:59:31,760 --> 00:59:33,740
We really need to get out of this.

1009
00:59:34,250 --> 00:59:38,660
So I take the view by the end of 2016 
that you had to,

1010
00:59:39,320 --> 00:59:42,620
you had to respect the fact that 
ordinary people had cut through the crap

1011
00:59:42,621 --> 00:59:47,621
of the debate and it got to the heart of
the matter and the heart of the matter 

1012
00:59:47,621 --> 00:59:50,630
wasn't the cost of Brexit,
which is what I had,

1013
00:59:51,010 --> 00:59:53,900
I think mistakenly focused on prior to 
the referendum.

1014
00:59:53,930 --> 00:59:58,930
What was it like for you as a public 
person and someone that writes about 

1015
00:59:58,930 --> 01:00:01,010
this stuff and put your opinions out 
there that have that realization?

1016
01:00:01,880 --> 01:00:04,100
I think it's very important if you write
regularly,

1017
01:00:04,101 --> 01:00:06,920
if you are what we call a public 
intellectual,

1018
01:00:07,200 --> 01:00:10,040
a to be willing to admit that you've 
been wrong.

1019
01:00:10,790 --> 01:00:15,500
I think you have to be prepared to say I
was wrong and I.

1020
01:00:15,540 --> 01:00:20,540
I think I was wrong in the sense that 
what I wish I had done looking back was.

1021
01:00:25,160 --> 01:00:30,160
I wish I had said to David Cameron and 
George Osborne in the spring of 2016 

1022
01:00:31,160 --> 01:00:36,160
when it was clear that the Europeans 
were going to make no meaningful 

1023
01:00:36,160 --> 01:00:39,971
concession on the immigration issue.
When they basically sent an insulting 

1024
01:00:39,971 --> 01:00:42,770
proposal about what could be done about 
migration,

1025
01:00:43,160 --> 01:00:45,770
that was the moment I should have said 
to cameron and Osborne,

1026
01:00:46,250 --> 01:00:47,350
forget it.
Yeah,

1027
01:00:47,450 --> 01:00:51,230
you should campaign for Brexit if that's
all they're going to offer you.

1028
01:00:51,350 --> 01:00:56,350
If they're so completely oblivious to 
the very real concerns about 

1029
01:00:56,350 --> 01:01:00,911
immigration,
then you should campaign for brexit 

1030
01:01:00,911 --> 01:01:01,670
instead of which we stuck with it and 
that was.

1031
01:01:01,700 --> 01:01:06,700
That was David Cameron's great mistake.
He should have said at that moment if 

1032
01:01:06,700 --> 01:01:10,511
that's all you've got,
I'm going to recommend brexit to the 

1033
01:01:10,511 --> 01:01:10,511
voters and it would have saved him too.
So.

1034
01:01:10,511 --> 01:01:15,380
So you think it was just,
it was just a bad negotiating play that 

1035
01:01:15,380 --> 01:01:18,101
he just didn't use some leverage to say 
we're going to have to walk away from 

1036
01:01:18,101 --> 01:01:18,101
this.

1037
01:01:18,101 --> 01:01:21,610
There was,
there was a moment when he should have 

1038
01:01:21,610 --> 01:01:21,610
walked away and I should have advised 
them to walk away.

1039
01:01:21,610 --> 01:01:26,530
So yeah,
I think one has to recognize when 

1040
01:01:26,530 --> 01:01:26,840
someone's made a mistake with such 
consequences.

1041
01:01:27,710 --> 01:01:32,710
The second thing which is worth knowing 
about this is that the people who then 

1042
01:01:32,710 --> 01:01:37,550
inherited power after the fall of 
Cameron and Osborne,

1043
01:01:37,910 --> 01:01:42,910
we're not the people who had campaigned 
for and one on racks and it was people 

1044
01:01:42,910 --> 01:01:46,010
who had been on the remain side.
Theresa may became prime minister.

1045
01:01:46,240 --> 01:01:48,380
Uh,
I always knew that would be a disaster.

1046
01:01:48,440 --> 01:01:51,770
I did not have high regard for her prior
to the referendum.

1047
01:01:51,830 --> 01:01:56,300
The Daily Mail essentially put her in 
that position and also Boris Johnson,

1048
01:01:56,301 --> 01:02:00,440
Michael Gove and others because they 
bungled the leadership contest.

1049
01:02:00,620 --> 01:02:05,620
So we then ended up with a terrible 
combination which was a commitment to 

1050
01:02:05,620 --> 01:02:10,061
Brexit,
but it's execution in the hands of 

1051
01:02:10,061 --> 01:02:10,790
people who had been remainers.

1052
01:02:11,240 --> 01:02:16,240
And I think the result is the worst of 
both worlds because right now we 

1053
01:02:16,341 --> 01:02:19,560
essentially have the psychological 
reality of brexit.

1054
01:02:19,561 --> 01:02:23,430
I think British public to a large extent
has accepted that we are leaving,

1055
01:02:23,760 --> 01:02:28,760
but the execution is a total mess by 
invoking article 50 early on the UK in 

1056
01:02:31,350 --> 01:02:36,350
essentially seated the,
the power and the divorce to the 

1057
01:02:37,980 --> 01:02:42,980
European Union.
And the concessions have come one after 

1058
01:02:42,980 --> 01:02:46,251
another.
Ever since then and we now find 

1059
01:02:46,251 --> 01:02:49,671
ourselves in the odd predicament that I 
think Theresa May is saying that brexit 

1060
01:02:49,671 --> 01:02:53,340
means you ceased to be a voting member 
of the European Union,

1061
01:02:53,400 --> 01:02:58,400
but you remain within the customs union 
potentially even within the single 

1062
01:02:58,400 --> 01:03:01,170
market and you accept all the rules and 
regulations of the European Union.

1063
01:03:01,171 --> 01:03:03,960
You just don't have any power.
If that's the end game,

1064
01:03:04,500 --> 01:03:09,120
then it's a disaster so that the people 
that are trying to stop this now,

1065
01:03:09,121 --> 01:03:12,960
they want to invoke some some pretty 
crazy extreme stuff.

1066
01:03:12,990 --> 01:03:15,180
Right?
I mean there would be some really,

1067
01:03:15,240 --> 01:03:20,240
very rarely if ever used rules.
Am I right about this that would 

1068
01:03:20,240 --> 01:03:21,480
actually allow this to allow the state 
to occur.

1069
01:03:22,020 --> 01:03:22,770
Well,
listen,

1070
01:03:22,800 --> 01:03:24,800
I think there's going to,
without getting into all of them,

1071
01:03:24,820 --> 01:03:29,820
I knew that there is a level of 
complexity in the discussions now in 

1072
01:03:29,820 --> 01:03:33,621
London that is bewildering to most 
ordinary procedure people when people 

1073
01:03:33,621 --> 01:03:36,670
start talking about Max Faq and the 
customs union complex.

1074
01:03:37,970 --> 01:03:38,580
Confusing,
right?

1075
01:03:38,581 --> 01:03:43,581
Because I discussed it with Douglas 
Murray and he was even a little 

1076
01:03:43,581 --> 01:03:45,711
confused,
so it's actually not confusing in the 

1077
01:03:45,711 --> 01:03:48,291
sense that what is happening is that 
Theresa May is trying to get Britain to 

1078
01:03:48,291 --> 01:03:52,611
accept the realities of a belonging to 
the European customs union,

1079
01:03:53,551 --> 01:03:56,310
which would preclude Britain having its 
own trade policy,

1080
01:03:56,670 --> 01:04:01,670
uh,
with our leaving the European Union's 

1081
01:04:01,670 --> 01:04:03,720
decision making body.
So essentially in that version,

1082
01:04:03,721 --> 01:04:06,810
brexit is just a,
you have the responsibilities,

1083
01:04:06,811 --> 01:04:10,500
you just don't have any power anymore,
which is definitely not what the British

1084
01:04:10,501 --> 01:04:13,980
public was told that it was getting in,
in brexit.

1085
01:04:14,270 --> 01:04:15,110
Uh,
the,

1086
01:04:15,250 --> 01:04:19,170
the bigger problem in my mind is not one
that,

1087
01:04:19,320 --> 01:04:22,860
that we've discussed.
And that is that all of this will end in

1088
01:04:22,890 --> 01:04:25,890
tears to the point at which Jeremy 
Corbyn,

1089
01:04:25,891 --> 01:04:29,430
the most left wing leader of the Labour 
party has ever had in its history,

1090
01:04:29,431 --> 01:04:34,431
becomes prime minister because Theresa 
May is leading the country towards this 

1091
01:04:35,851 --> 01:04:40,590
very unhappy compromise at some point.
The people who truly believe in Brexit,

1092
01:04:40,740 --> 01:04:42,990
Jacob Riis smog,
for example,

1093
01:04:43,260 --> 01:04:45,270
uh,
perhaps Michael Gove,

1094
01:04:45,600 --> 01:04:49,050
uh,
they may decide when we can't ultimately

1095
01:04:49,051 --> 01:04:50,730
accept this and the government,
they may fall.

1096
01:04:50,731 --> 01:04:53,040
But the problem is that if the 
government falls,

1097
01:04:53,490 --> 01:04:56,010
then Jeremy Corbyn is prime minister.
Uh,

1098
01:04:56,040 --> 01:05:01,040
if the government doesn't fall and we go
all the way to the finishing line with 

1099
01:05:01,040 --> 01:05:03,030
this Theresa May version of Brexit,
then I think the Conservatives will lose

1100
01:05:03,031 --> 01:05:08,031
the next election in 20,
22 and Jeremy Corbyn will be prime 

1101
01:05:08,031 --> 01:05:11,361
minister.
So the worst are about brexit is in my 

1102
01:05:11,361 --> 01:05:15,741
view that if it is bungled in this way,
it will open the door to a truly leftist

1103
01:05:18,550 --> 01:05:23,550
government and that will be far more 
economically damaging than anything 

1104
01:05:23,550 --> 01:05:23,550
brexit has done.

1105
01:05:23,860 --> 01:05:26,110
And that's the nightmare scenario for 
me.

1106
01:05:26,380 --> 01:05:30,340
And probably socially damaging and 
figures zillion other reasons deeply.

1107
01:05:30,400 --> 01:05:34,300
We should be extremely suspicious of 
Corbyn and his people.

1108
01:05:34,570 --> 01:05:39,570
They are committed Marxists.
They've been on the wrong side of every 

1109
01:05:39,570 --> 01:05:42,670
issue in my lifetime with a possible 
exception of South African apartheid.

1110
01:05:43,150 --> 01:05:48,150
And I do not trust them with the keys to
10 Downing Street because I think that 

1111
01:05:48,360 --> 01:05:51,940
their ultimate agenda is a truly 
revolutionary one,

1112
01:05:52,320 --> 01:05:54,670
a,
and it poses a threat to the fundamental

1113
01:05:54,671 --> 01:05:57,250
liberties,
the traditions of the constitution.

1114
01:05:57,280 --> 01:05:59,530
It's a dangerous,
dangerous prospect.

1115
01:05:59,920 --> 01:06:01,720
And I'm much more worried about carbon 
that,

1116
01:06:01,721 --> 01:06:02,320
about brexit.

1117
01:06:02,750 --> 01:06:07,750
I mean,
this is how I feel about what's 

1118
01:06:07,750 --> 01:06:09,191
happening with our left in America to 
that you guys are giving us basically 

1119
01:06:09,191 --> 01:06:09,191
the

1120
01:06:09,191 --> 01:06:13,600
cursor to this.
I think one of the lessons of history 

1121
01:06:13,600 --> 01:06:14,890
and now we can bring history in,
is that with populism,

1122
01:06:14,891 --> 01:06:19,891
you,
you get two flavors in a typical 

1123
01:06:19,891 --> 01:06:21,910
backlash that would come after the 
financial crisis.

1124
01:06:22,560 --> 01:06:26,830
Uh,
the political establishment discredited.

1125
01:06:27,220 --> 01:06:31,090
There's a backlash against inequality,
uh,

1126
01:06:31,240 --> 01:06:33,700
all of the things that typically follow 
a financial crisis.

1127
01:06:34,090 --> 01:06:37,300
But there are two possibilities.
There's the populism of the left,

1128
01:06:37,301 --> 01:06:40,240
which is the tax,
the rich solution,

1129
01:06:41,170 --> 01:06:46,170
but the populism of the writers more 
potent because it says that it's about 

1130
01:06:46,271 --> 01:06:47,800
immigration.
It's about globalization,

1131
01:06:47,801 --> 01:06:51,720
it's about free trade.
And so broadly speaking,

1132
01:06:51,730 --> 01:06:55,180
there's a very good study that shows 
this afro big financial crises,

1133
01:06:55,181 --> 01:07:00,181
the populace of the right.
Do better because they offer a more 

1134
01:07:00,181 --> 01:07:02,581
plausible story,
but if they don't deliver when they 

1135
01:07:02,581 --> 01:07:06,931
generally don't,
because quite hard to make immigration 

1136
01:07:06,931 --> 01:07:09,811
control and terrorists pay quite hard 
actually to make your constituents 

1137
01:07:09,811 --> 01:07:14,701
better off with those policies,
then the pendulum has a tendency to 

1138
01:07:14,701 --> 01:07:18,151
swing to the populism of the left and 
that has happened in Britain really 

1139
01:07:18,151 --> 01:07:20,320
quick because Corbyn became popular very
soon after brexit.

1140
01:07:21,400 --> 01:07:26,330
It's slower here,
but the fear must be that are.

1141
01:07:26,530 --> 01:07:31,530
If the trump experiment goes as wrong as
the vast majority of of intellectual to 

1142
01:07:31,991 --> 01:07:36,991
expect it to.
The pendulum will swing to the left of 

1143
01:07:36,991 --> 01:07:40,891
the Democratic Party.
And that scenario seems to me more and 

1144
01:07:40,891 --> 01:07:43,270
more plausible are.
And I don't think that's a.

1145
01:07:43,420 --> 01:07:46,030
that's a not an appetizing then.

1146
01:07:46,750 --> 01:07:51,750
That's genuinely scary to me.
But I want to back up for one second 

1147
01:07:51,750 --> 01:07:54,901
because the moment that you had that,
you said a few times happened in these 

1148
01:07:54,901 --> 01:07:56,680
pubs when you would go there and people 
would say this about one point 3 million

1149
01:07:57,040 --> 01:07:58,720
Muslims in,
in Germany.

1150
01:07:59,470 --> 01:08:00,580
How do you.
So,

1151
01:08:00,581 --> 01:08:05,581
okay,
so if you were listening to the 

1152
01:08:05,581 --> 01:08:07,141
mainstream media,
they would say these people are all 

1153
01:08:07,141 --> 01:08:07,141
racist.
That's what they would tell you.

1154
01:08:07,141 --> 01:08:07,300
They're,
they're racists and they're bigots.

1155
01:08:07,900 --> 01:08:10,060
I suspect that's not what you think of 
these people,

1156
01:08:10,120 --> 01:08:15,120
although there probably was a certain 
amount of people that are just racist 

1157
01:08:15,120 --> 01:08:17,000
and don't like people have a different 
color or a different culture.

1158
01:08:18,170 --> 01:08:23,170
How do you even have that conversation?
Because that's what so much of this is 

1159
01:08:23,170 --> 01:08:26,591
about because you,
I'm sure we'd have a pint with these 

1160
01:08:26,591 --> 01:08:26,630
people and you'd talk to them and 
realize that they weren't racist.

1161
01:08:26,631 --> 01:08:30,020
They were actually just worried about 
their future,

1162
01:08:30,050 --> 01:08:35,050
which is legit.
But if you can't have that discussion 

1163
01:08:35,050 --> 01:08:35,720
because every time you open your mouth,
they tell you you're racist.

1164
01:08:35,721 --> 01:08:38,810
Well then we know what you end up with.
Look,

1165
01:08:38,811 --> 01:08:41,810
I would be a very strange

1166
01:08:41,910 --> 01:08:46,910
if I took a bigoted view on this subject
because I'm an immigrant.

1167
01:08:48,110 --> 01:08:53,110
I'm in fact,
it's about to become an American 

1168
01:08:53,110 --> 01:08:53,110
citizen.
Uh,

1169
01:08:53,110 --> 01:08:57,410
in a matter of weeks.
My wife was a refugee who got from 

1170
01:09:00,710 --> 01:09:05,100
Somalia originally to the Netherlands by
applying for asylum.

1171
01:09:05,990 --> 01:09:10,990
Uh,
and so we would be the last couple to 

1172
01:09:10,990 --> 01:09:14,421
take a kind of a bigoted view on the 
immigration issue because we're 

1173
01:09:14,970 --> 01:09:19,560
immigrants.
When I had conversations on this subject

1174
01:09:19,910 --> 01:09:23,380
at the time of the brexit referendum,
I remember realizing that the opposition

1175
01:09:23,381 --> 01:09:28,381
to immigration was not plausibly a 
racist because I remember somebody 

1176
01:09:30,931 --> 01:09:35,931
making the point that he was as worried 
about the people from Lithuania and 

1177
01:09:36,660 --> 01:09:41,370
Poland coming to Britain as he was about
people from Syria and Iraq.

1178
01:09:41,800 --> 01:09:46,800
Uh,
and you probably know that people from 

1179
01:09:46,800 --> 01:09:49,740
Poland and Lithuania are pretty wide.
So here's the thing,

1180
01:09:50,490 --> 01:09:55,490
what we all read to recognize is that if
immigration shoots up,

1181
01:09:57,180 --> 01:10:00,030
if it grows from,
in the case of Britain,

1182
01:10:00,270 --> 01:10:02,330
10,000
or $20,000

1183
01:10:02,331 --> 01:10:04,800
a year to 200,000
or 300,000

1184
01:10:04,801 --> 01:10:08,970
a year,
perfectly unprejudiced,

1185
01:10:08,971 --> 01:10:11,370
people will say,
that's too much.

1186
01:10:11,970 --> 01:10:16,970
This is going too fast.
And that I think was the dominant 

1187
01:10:16,970 --> 01:10:21,350
argument.
Of course there are people who are 

1188
01:10:21,350 --> 01:10:25,310
racists in any society.
But the striking thing about Britain is 

1189
01:10:25,310 --> 01:10:26,310
actually that it's not a terribly racist
place.

1190
01:10:27,000 --> 01:10:32,000
Did you see many people protesting 
against Prince Harry's decision to marry

1191
01:10:32,761 --> 01:10:35,190
an American of mixed mixed race?

1192
01:10:35,470 --> 01:10:37,580
I was there a couple of days before the 
delivery.

1193
01:10:37,590 --> 01:10:38,120
Exactly.
Were

1194
01:10:38,130 --> 01:10:43,130
huge crowds.
This matches extraordinary popular with 

1195
01:10:43,201 --> 01:10:48,201
ordinary people.
So I think it's hard to argue that 

1196
01:10:48,201 --> 01:10:50,750
racism played any meaningful part.
Uh,

1197
01:10:51,320 --> 01:10:51,990
the,
the,

1198
01:10:52,120 --> 01:10:55,140
the white supremacist element in Britain
is really,

1199
01:10:55,290 --> 01:11:00,290
is really very insignificant.
And actually one of the ways in which 

1200
01:11:00,290 --> 01:11:02,760
the British like to define themselves is
as being tolerant,

1201
01:11:03,270 --> 01:11:08,270
uh,
memories of the war of not entirely 

1202
01:11:08,270 --> 01:11:09,330
faded.
Even as the wartime generation gradually

1203
01:11:09,331 --> 01:11:13,690
disappears from the scene.
What was the war against apart?

1204
01:11:13,710 --> 01:11:16,290
It was a war against the ultimate racist
state.

1205
01:11:16,560 --> 01:11:20,730
What her Jeremy Corbyn the most in the 
last three or four months.

1206
01:11:21,120 --> 01:11:26,120
The evidence that there are antisemitic 
elements within his faction of the Labor

1207
01:11:26,281 --> 01:11:31,281
left that hurt him.
And it's important that that argument 

1208
01:11:31,281 --> 01:11:34,890
being made because it has real truth to 
it.

1209
01:11:35,160 --> 01:11:39,060
And I think ordinary people think that's
no good.

1210
01:11:39,480 --> 01:11:42,420
So I think this is not really about 
racism.

1211
01:11:42,420 --> 01:11:47,420
It's not about bigotry.
It's about how rapidly should 

1212
01:11:47,420 --> 01:11:50,690
immigration occur,
how large should flows be across 

1213
01:11:50,690 --> 01:11:51,690
borders,
and the lesson of history is that if you

1214
01:11:51,691 --> 01:11:56,691
allow a real surge in immigration,
there will be a populous backlash 

1215
01:11:56,691 --> 01:12:00,321
against us.
What happened in the United States in 

1216
01:12:00,321 --> 01:12:01,190
the late 19th century,
the peak in the 18 eighties,

1217
01:12:01,230 --> 01:12:06,230
the foreign born percentage of the 
population in the US was about 14 

1218
01:12:06,230 --> 01:12:07,590
percent and gone up from relatively low 
level to about 14 percent.

1219
01:12:08,670 --> 01:12:13,670
Same thing has happened in our time.
It was down I think below seven percent 

1220
01:12:13,670 --> 01:12:17,901
in the mid 20th century,
in the period after World War Two 

1221
01:12:17,901 --> 01:12:21,290
immigrants.
We're a relatively small proportion of 

1222
01:12:21,290 --> 01:12:23,070
neat foreign born citizens were pretty 
small portion of the US population.

1223
01:12:23,280 --> 01:12:28,280
And then from the 19 eighties onwards,
the proportion surged and the character 

1224
01:12:29,371 --> 01:12:31,630
of the immigrants changed,
uh,

1225
01:12:31,990 --> 01:12:33,900
the places that they came from change.

1226
01:12:33,900 --> 01:12:36,570
And these changes are bound to elicit a 
reaction.

1227
01:12:36,630 --> 01:12:41,630
It always happens and it's not enough 
for people in the liberal elites who by 

1228
01:12:42,271 --> 01:12:45,900
and large don't live in areas where 
immigrants come to say,

1229
01:12:46,050 --> 01:12:50,590
what a terrible deplorable bunch of 
chauvinists you are for not wanting a,

1230
01:12:50,700 --> 01:12:55,700
for not wanting more immigrants.
That's simply that simply historically 

1231
01:12:55,700 --> 01:12:55,920
stupid.
Uh,

1232
01:12:55,921 --> 01:12:59,910
and the other thing that stupid about 
this in the United States is a,

1233
01:13:00,120 --> 01:13:03,390
the people on the left who want to 
legitimize illegal immigration.

1234
01:13:03,630 --> 01:13:08,630
Now,
I think for many people who were 

1235
01:13:08,630 --> 01:13:09,600
attracted to trump,
the issue was the illegal quality of the

1236
01:13:09,601 --> 01:13:14,601
immigration.
The rule of law is a big deal in the 

1237
01:13:14,601 --> 01:13:17,331
English speaking world,
and people don't like to hear anything 

1238
01:13:17,331 --> 01:13:20,340
that simply says,
amnesty for lawbreakers,

1239
01:13:20,620 --> 01:13:22,790
or if you're a law abiding citizen and 
you'll suddenly told,

1240
01:13:22,920 --> 01:13:27,920
well yet the law applies to you,
but there are these other people it's 

1241
01:13:27,920 --> 01:13:27,920
not going to apply to.

1242
01:13:27,920 --> 01:13:29,310
Then your natural reaction is,
screw this.

1243
01:13:29,370 --> 01:13:31,170
That's why I thought one of his best 
lines,

1244
01:13:31,171 --> 01:13:36,171
he doesn't use it as much anymore,
but during the campaign were either a 

1245
01:13:36,171 --> 01:13:37,590
country or we're not.
I thought was a really effective line.

1246
01:13:37,920 --> 01:13:39,840
You either have laws or you don't.
I mean,

1247
01:13:39,841 --> 01:13:44,841
that in essence is the true.
So let's shift to trump a little bit 

1248
01:13:44,841 --> 01:13:44,841
here.
Um,

1249
01:13:45,090 --> 01:13:48,000
I think that we're kind of in a similar 
spot with him,

1250
01:13:48,001 --> 01:13:50,340
which is that it's better than the 
alternative,

1251
01:13:50,720 --> 01:13:53,010
that that's certainly how I feel at this
point,

1252
01:13:53,310 --> 01:13:58,310
that all of the forces that we've spent 
the last hour plus talking about would 

1253
01:13:58,310 --> 01:14:02,721
be that much more emboldened against 
free thought and all and free expression

1254
01:14:04,110 --> 01:14:08,830
and open inquiry and all the things that
we care about and historical fact and,

1255
01:14:08,870 --> 01:14:12,580
and everything else if he wasn't 
president.

1256
01:14:12,581 --> 01:14:17,581
Right now,
I am deeply ambivalent about all of 

1257
01:14:17,581 --> 01:14:17,581
this.

1258
01:14:17,581 --> 01:14:18,160
I think it's,
it's very,

1259
01:14:18,220 --> 01:14:20,310
very hard,
uh,

1260
01:14:20,410 --> 01:14:22,610
to say,
uh,

1261
01:14:22,980 --> 01:14:27,980
a good word about the personality of 
Donald Trump.

1262
01:14:28,840 --> 01:14:29,550
I'm with you.
I,

1263
01:14:29,570 --> 01:14:31,370
I,
it was a reason that I,

1264
01:14:31,510 --> 01:14:36,510
I found it impossible to support him in 
2016.

1265
01:14:38,740 --> 01:14:43,740
I think one has to acknowledge that he 
has a used inflammatory language,

1266
01:14:45,920 --> 01:14:47,530
uh,
on the issues are,

1267
01:14:47,830 --> 01:14:50,140
we've talked about immigration,
uh,

1268
01:14:50,200 --> 01:14:52,630
that he has a record of,
of,

1269
01:14:52,900 --> 01:14:56,770
of lying,
which is a,

1270
01:14:57,250 --> 01:15:00,520
even by the standards of American 
presidents.

1271
01:15:00,940 --> 01:15:03,580
Pretty remarkable.
Uh,

1272
01:15:04,030 --> 01:15:09,030
and so the familiar list of things about
Donald trump that most of my friends 

1273
01:15:11,081 --> 01:15:13,200
find objectionable is kind of hard for 
me to,

1274
01:15:13,380 --> 01:15:17,050
to dismiss.
But I said I'm bivalent for a reason.

1275
01:15:18,220 --> 01:15:22,030
On the other hand,
number one,

1276
01:15:22,990 --> 01:15:27,990
what if he lost?
I said this to Sam Harris a few weeks 

1277
01:15:28,240 --> 01:15:29,890
ago.
Let's run the counterfactual.

1278
01:15:29,920 --> 01:15:33,070
Let's just what historians should do.
Let's imagine an alternative history.

1279
01:15:33,940 --> 01:15:36,280
If Donald trump had lost the election by
let's say,

1280
01:15:36,281 --> 01:15:38,530
the same narrow margin that he wanted 
it,

1281
01:15:39,130 --> 01:15:44,130
how would all those people who voted for
him have felt,

1282
01:15:44,650 --> 01:15:47,260
and how would they have behaved to my 
mind?

1283
01:15:47,260 --> 01:15:52,260
The election of Donald trump is a 
cathartic moment for those people.

1284
01:15:52,480 --> 01:15:57,480
So despised by the liberal elites that 
they could refer to them as deplorables.

1285
01:15:58,870 --> 01:16:03,870
The people who voted for Donald trump 
are not by and large are racists,

1286
01:16:06,040 --> 01:16:08,230
are not by and large,
uh,

1287
01:16:08,820 --> 01:16:13,820
uh,
anything like Donald Trump is 

1288
01:16:13,820 --> 01:16:16,171
personally.
What attracted them to trump were two 

1289
01:16:16,171 --> 01:16:20,581
things,
which as with the brexit campaign will 

1290
01:16:20,581 --> 01:16:20,860
legitimate.
Number one,

1291
01:16:21,370 --> 01:16:25,000
they were attracted to trump's policy 
positions on trade,

1292
01:16:26,560 --> 01:16:28,810
on immigration,
on Islam,

1293
01:16:29,400 --> 01:16:34,400
at and on our,
the somewhat a corrupt liberal elite 

1294
01:16:34,871 --> 01:16:37,990
that had been running the country for 
the previous eight years,

1295
01:16:38,020 --> 01:16:40,630
so I think they were attracted to 
trump's policy positions,

1296
01:16:41,380 --> 01:16:44,950
but they were also attracted to his 
cultural position and I think about half

1297
01:16:44,951 --> 01:16:49,951
of American populism is cultural.
What attracted the friends I have who 

1298
01:16:50,531 --> 01:16:55,210
supported trump to trump was his 
fundamental shift in language,

1299
01:16:55,420 --> 01:16:59,470
away from the politically correct 
talking points of the political class,

1300
01:16:59,471 --> 01:17:04,000
Republicans and Democrats alike,
to a demotic normal way of speaking,

1301
01:17:04,060 --> 01:17:07,180
such as you would here in the typical 
American bar,

1302
01:17:07,330 --> 01:17:10,310
more or less anywhere in the country 
except Massachusetts,

1303
01:17:10,460 --> 01:17:11,570
Stanford,
California,

1304
01:17:11,571 --> 01:17:12,200
and the rest.

1305
01:17:13,580 --> 01:17:14,060
Now,
I,

1306
01:17:14,150 --> 01:17:16,520
I remember thinking on the eve of the 
election,

1307
01:17:17,570 --> 01:17:22,570
if you line up all the people who are 
going to vote for her and you line up 

1308
01:17:22,570 --> 01:17:22,570
all the people who are going to vote for
him,

1309
01:17:22,570 --> 01:17:24,710
which line would you rather be in?
Remember at that point,

1310
01:17:24,711 --> 01:17:25,860
I'm not a citizen.
I don't know,

1311
01:17:27,810 --> 01:17:30,110
and I thought,
that's easy.

1312
01:17:30,980 --> 01:17:35,980
I'm with the people who are so pissed 
with the political establishment that 

1313
01:17:36,520 --> 01:17:41,520
they're ready to take a chance on this 
guy because they see no other way to 

1314
01:17:41,520 --> 01:17:46,301
shake things up.
The way my friend Jerry Blake put it to 

1315
01:17:46,301 --> 01:17:46,820
me,
ex marine corps,

1316
01:17:47,480 --> 01:17:52,480
Xn ypd never went to college,
helps take care of my wife.

1317
01:17:52,891 --> 01:17:57,891
Security.
Jerry said to me early 2016 two things 

1318
01:17:57,891 --> 01:17:59,090
that stuck in my mind.
First he told me trump was gonna win,

1319
01:18:00,020 --> 01:18:02,440
but then he said the two reasons why he 
supported trump.

1320
01:18:03,350 --> 01:18:05,180
Number One,
he tells it like it is.

1321
01:18:06,140 --> 01:18:09,800
Number two,
he's going to shake things up by.

1322
01:18:09,801 --> 01:18:14,801
He tells it like it is.
Jared did not mean he is always 

1323
01:18:14,801 --> 01:18:18,011
truthful.
What he meant was he talks like me by 

1324
01:18:18,011 --> 01:18:22,331
shaking things up.
Jerry meant we have to do something 

1325
01:18:22,331 --> 01:18:23,510
because this system as it stands is not 
in my interests.

1326
01:18:24,280 --> 01:18:29,280
It's not in my interests economically 
because it seems to favor China over the

1327
01:18:29,420 --> 01:18:34,420
United States.
Mexicans over a native born Americans 

1328
01:18:34,420 --> 01:18:36,980
the rich one percent over me,
the median household,

1329
01:18:37,370 --> 01:18:42,370
but he's also.
It's also about this cultural reaction 

1330
01:18:42,370 --> 01:18:46,691
against the multiculturalism that has 
become the orthodoxy of the liberal 

1331
01:18:46,691 --> 01:18:49,670
left.
So for all my reservations about trump,

1332
01:18:50,510 --> 01:18:52,970
I completely got why people voted for 
him.

1333
01:18:53,270 --> 01:18:58,270
And I think their reaction had he lost,
we'd have been toxic.

1334
01:19:00,500 --> 01:19:03,200
I don't think they would have accepted 
the legitimacy of the result.

1335
01:19:03,320 --> 01:19:04,940
I think they would have bought the 
story,

1336
01:19:04,941 --> 01:19:06,920
trump would have told them that the 
election being rigged,

1337
01:19:07,040 --> 01:19:10,820
and I think we would have had a poisoned
body politic from day one of the Clinton

1338
01:19:10,821 --> 01:19:13,310
presidency if it all ends.

1339
01:19:13,320 --> 01:19:14,840
Oddly though we're having that right 
now,

1340
01:19:14,841 --> 01:19:16,040
just in the reverse,
right?

1341
01:19:16,100 --> 01:19:21,100
It would have been worse,
but we're having a left that's not 

1342
01:19:21,100 --> 01:19:21,100
accepting the legitimacy of the 
election.

1343
01:19:21,100 --> 01:19:22,710
And I think it would have been worse.
Yeah,

1344
01:19:23,090 --> 01:19:25,430
I think it would have been worse.
Uh,

1345
01:19:25,760 --> 01:19:30,760
and I think,
and this is another part of the story 

1346
01:19:33,070 --> 01:19:37,850
that for Jerry and his and his many,
many fellow Americans who voted trump,

1347
01:19:38,420 --> 01:19:42,170
this has always been a gamble and 
they've always had a sense that it could

1348
01:19:42,171 --> 01:19:43,280
go wrong.
You know,

1349
01:19:43,281 --> 01:19:45,440
when you shake things up sometimes they 
break.

1350
01:19:46,400 --> 01:19:50,180
And I,
I sense that if it all ends in fiasco,

1351
01:19:50,181 --> 01:19:54,020
which I guess that the vast majority of 
public intellectuals expect,

1352
01:19:54,021 --> 01:19:56,720
and some combination of Watergate and 
other scandals,

1353
01:19:57,200 --> 01:20:00,830
I think Jerry and his and his fellow 
American trump supporters will say,

1354
01:20:00,831 --> 01:20:01,700
well,
we gave it a try.

1355
01:20:02,150 --> 01:20:02,780
Give it a try.

1356
01:20:03,380 --> 01:20:05,000
And I,
I think that's,

1357
01:20:05,030 --> 01:20:10,030
that's one possible scenario.
The other reason that I am ambivalent 

1358
01:20:10,111 --> 01:20:15,111
about trump is that for all his flaws,
in some ways he's doing a better job on 

1359
01:20:15,421 --> 01:20:20,310
foreign policy than his predecessor did 
a because trump has this superpower that

1360
01:20:20,340 --> 01:20:25,340
most intellectuals can understand.
He has an unerring instinct for the 

1361
01:20:25,340 --> 01:20:28,770
weakness of the counterparty that it's a
kind of almost animal instinct.

1362
01:20:29,250 --> 01:20:31,980
But some are Donald Trump can tell when 
the other side is weak.

1363
01:20:32,190 --> 01:20:34,380
You could see it in Jeb Bush,
you could see it in Marco.

1364
01:20:34,381 --> 01:20:39,381
Rubio could see it in Hillary Clinton,
and now I think he sees it in the 

1365
01:20:39,381 --> 01:20:40,830
Europeans.
He sees in Angola Merkel,

1366
01:20:41,580 --> 01:20:44,130
you don't pay enough for your defense.
What if I walk out on NATO?

1367
01:20:44,970 --> 01:20:45,840
Yeah.
Well,

1368
01:20:45,950 --> 01:20:49,650
the season Kim Jong UN and he sees it in
Xi Jinping.

1369
01:20:50,130 --> 01:20:51,540
He sees it in the,
uh,

1370
01:20:51,630 --> 01:20:53,130
in the supreme leader in Neuron.

1371
01:20:54,420 --> 01:20:58,200
So my ambivalence is partly my sympathy 
for trump supporters,

1372
01:20:58,210 --> 01:21:02,670
my fundamental sense of why they voted 
for him.

1373
01:21:03,180 --> 01:21:08,180
But it's also that in some ways this 
disruption has its plus side in the way 

1374
01:21:08,180 --> 01:21:09,960
that it's repositioning the United 
States.

1375
01:21:10,140 --> 01:21:10,560
I mean,
I,

1376
01:21:10,650 --> 01:21:15,650
to me,
it's given oxygen to everything that 

1377
01:21:15,650 --> 01:21:15,650
we've talked about here.
And that doesn't,

1378
01:21:15,650 --> 01:21:19,710
that doesn't discount all of the 
legitimate concerns that you look.

1379
01:21:19,711 --> 01:21:22,140
The big concern for me as I mentioned 
before,

1380
01:21:22,141 --> 01:21:23,850
is that the pendulum swings the other 
way.

1381
01:21:23,851 --> 01:21:28,170
If this all ends in tears,
all of those who defended it,

1382
01:21:28,320 --> 01:21:30,900
even if they defended it,
halfhearted delight me,

1383
01:21:31,080 --> 01:21:35,220
will be discredited.
And the damage will be irreparable,

1384
01:21:35,410 --> 01:21:38,730
uh,
for conservatives and populists alike.

1385
01:21:39,930 --> 01:21:44,930
The left we empowered and they will 
spend the rest of our lives telling us 

1386
01:21:45,151 --> 01:21:47,910
that we were apologists for the worst 
president.

1387
01:21:49,170 --> 01:21:54,170
And that's,
that's not a scenario that you can 

1388
01:21:54,170 --> 01:21:55,230
discount likely for a time.

1389
01:21:55,590 --> 01:21:59,880
I think it was exhilarating are freely 
admit that for me,

1390
01:22:00,540 --> 01:22:05,540
one of the most satisfying aspects of 
trump's victory was that all the people 

1391
01:22:05,540 --> 01:22:09,171
I most dislike in this contract,
we're in a state of shock for weeks and 

1392
01:22:09,991 --> 01:22:11,820
I remember things that are.
You know,

1393
01:22:13,320 --> 01:22:17,490
it can't be all bad if the people.
I really can't stand her in this state,

1394
01:22:18,390 --> 01:22:21,090
but you have to.
I think with history and mind,

1395
01:22:21,091 --> 01:22:26,091
be conscious of the dangers of the fact 
that this could end so badly that it 

1396
01:22:26,091 --> 01:22:30,621
does irreparable damage and and the 
worst damage of all will be if it 

1397
01:22:30,621 --> 01:22:34,110
propels the left of the Democratic Party
into power and that,

1398
01:22:34,170 --> 01:22:36,510
that you can't reload.
You can't really do that.

1399
01:22:36,750 --> 01:22:41,750
The worst thing about studying history 
is that it makes you aware of under 

1400
01:22:42,181 --> 01:22:47,181
terministic that historical processes 
that there is always more than one 

1401
01:22:47,181 --> 01:22:50,751
future.
Where's the future of trial as the 

1402
01:22:50,751 --> 01:22:50,910
future of tragedy and there's this kind 
of other future in the middle,

1403
01:22:50,911 --> 01:22:55,911
which is a little bit of both and that's
really one of the historical moment is 

1404
01:22:56,520 --> 01:23:01,520
bad for restful sleep on wakes up in the
morning and I'm sure you have the same 

1405
01:23:02,461 --> 01:23:07,461
feeling wondering what alert will be on 
your phone and what message will be on 

1406
01:23:09,611 --> 01:23:10,270
your phone.

1407
01:23:11,230 --> 01:23:16,230
Will the alert say was broken out,
will the alert say a palace coup and 

1408
01:23:19,601 --> 01:23:21,700
will the message say,
uh,

1409
01:23:22,030 --> 01:23:27,030
your reputation has just been a been 
destroyed by some accusation or other.

1410
01:23:28,960 --> 01:23:33,960
So one wakes up in a state of anxiety in
the United States of 2018.

1411
01:23:34,330 --> 01:23:39,330
And that is a reality for that I think 
is inherent in both the culture war that

1412
01:23:40,451 --> 01:23:43,060
we've spoken about and the trump 
presidency,

1413
01:23:43,061 --> 01:23:45,820
which is in some measure a backlash 
against that.

1414
01:23:46,120 --> 01:23:46,900
That culture war.

1415
01:23:48,740 --> 01:23:53,740
We're going to leave it at that,
but I am going to demand that you come 

1416
01:23:53,740 --> 01:23:54,560
back.
I don't think I've ever demanded that.

1417
01:23:54,561 --> 01:23:55,850
I guess come back,
I've been asked,

1418
01:23:56,060 --> 01:24:01,060
but I'm legitimately demanding that you 
come back because next time I want to 

1419
01:24:01,060 --> 01:24:02,530
do,
I want to just do all history and,

1420
01:24:02,620 --> 01:24:07,620
and even even barely jump in.
I want them to meet with the British 

1421
01:24:07,620 --> 01:24:09,830
empire stuff and Churchill and.
Okay,

1422
01:24:09,980 --> 01:24:13,590
I'm demanding it.
Will you accept my demand except.

1423
01:24:13,780 --> 01:24:15,990
All right.
It took a long time to get you here but,

1424
01:24:16,070 --> 01:24:20,040
but considering we're both two guys just
off planes today and you're a,

1425
01:24:20,100 --> 01:24:25,100
you're like 87 hours out of whack and 
jet lag and all the things we said will 

1426
01:24:25,100 --> 01:24:26,340
be taken out of context on twitter.
Well,

1427
01:24:26,490 --> 01:24:31,000
I sincerely hope everything because 
that's how you know,

1428
01:24:31,010 --> 01:24:33,470
the whole thing goes.
This has truly,

1429
01:24:33,471 --> 01:24:38,471
truly been an absolute pleasure and 
thank you for doing this and send my 

1430
01:24:38,471 --> 01:24:38,471
best.
Of course.

1431
01:24:38,471 --> 01:24:38,480
Diane.
Sure will.

1432
01:24:38,510 --> 01:24:40,410
And uh,
for more Neil,

1433
01:24:40,430 --> 01:24:45,430
you can follow him on twitter,
although you don't fight with people 

1434
01:24:45,430 --> 01:24:45,430
that much on twitter,
which means,

1435
01:24:45,430 --> 01:24:46,520
which means you have strong moral 
character.

1436
01:24:47,140 --> 01:24:50,420
I decided the jungle warfare was not the
way to go.

1437
01:24:51,560 --> 01:24:56,560
He's a wise man and it's at an F E R G U
S.
