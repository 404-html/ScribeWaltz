1
00:00:02,570 --> 00:00:02,730
All

2
00:00:02,730 --> 00:00:03,563
right,
we're going to mix it up this week and 

3
00:00:04,191 --> 00:00:09,080
talk about something a little less 
controversial than usual feminism.

4
00:00:09,081 --> 00:00:10,310
Everyone agrees on that,
right?

5
00:00:10,610 --> 00:00:11,151
Okay,
good.

6
00:00:11,151 --> 00:00:11,984
That's what I thought.
My guest this week is Christina Hoff 

7
00:00:14,451 --> 00:00:15,284
summers.
Christina is a former philosophy 

8
00:00:17,301 --> 00:00:18,134
professor,
author and a speaker for the American 

9
00:00:21,710 --> 00:00:25,040
Enterprise Institute known for her 
critique of late 20th century feminism.

10
00:00:25,250 --> 00:00:26,083
Over the past few months.
I've become familiar with Christina 

11
00:00:27,891 --> 00:00:31,820
because her name kept popping up all 
over my twitter feed at first related to

12
00:00:31,821 --> 00:00:35,870
Gamergate and now because of her tongue 
and cheek commentary on campus,

13
00:00:35,871 --> 00:00:39,020
free speech,
trigger warnings and safe spaces.

14
00:00:39,290 --> 00:00:40,123
Actually thanks to twitter and to all of
you who've helped connect me with 

15
00:00:42,441 --> 00:00:43,274
likeminded people.
The show is really taken off in a way I 

16
00:00:45,321 --> 00:00:46,154
couldn't have imagined.
Suddenly I find myself immersed with 

17
00:00:48,591 --> 00:00:49,424
people I truly admire and respect.
We're all talking to each other in 

18
00:00:52,371 --> 00:00:55,580
various mediums and strengthening the 
ideals we stand for,

19
00:00:55,790 --> 00:00:58,640
even if we don't agree on every specific
issue.

20
00:00:59,000 --> 00:00:59,833
One such an issue that I haven't tackled
too deeply yet is feminism and that's 

21
00:01:03,381 --> 00:01:07,700
exactly why I wanted to have Christina 
on as an equity feminists.

22
00:01:07,701 --> 00:01:11,360
Christina cares about both women's and 
men's rights.

23
00:01:11,750 --> 00:01:14,150
You know that whole two things can be 
true at once.

24
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:14,993
Idea that I've been talking about,
I shouldn't say that feminism in and of 

25
00:01:17,271 --> 00:01:19,400
itself isn't one of my bread and butter 
topics.

26
00:01:19,401 --> 00:01:21,110
As you guys know,
I love discussing politics,

27
00:01:21,111 --> 00:01:23,930
foreign policy,
religion and secularism and more,

28
00:01:24,140 --> 00:01:27,080
but haven't done a ton on the topic of 
feminism.

29
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:30,110
Of course,
the argument could be made that feminism

30
00:01:30,111 --> 00:01:32,870
and the fight for women's rights is an 
absolute through line.

31
00:01:32,871 --> 00:01:34,490
Through all of the topics I just 
mentioned.

32
00:01:34,730 --> 00:01:37,250
Generally speaking,
where women are treated with equality,

33
00:01:37,251 --> 00:01:41,270
we see fair societies with more secular 
values and less radicalism.

34
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:42,433
This isn't a coincidence,
nor is it something that should be 

35
00:01:43,761 --> 00:01:44,420
overlooked.

36
00:01:44,420 --> 00:01:45,440
Actually,
if anything,

37
00:01:45,650 --> 00:01:48,950
it should be embraced.
If a society treats their women fairly,

38
00:01:49,130 --> 00:01:52,250
it is almost always a more successful 
society.

39
00:01:52,490 --> 00:01:53,323
On every other front,
the battle for equality of women has 

40
00:01:55,131 --> 00:01:59,030
been different all over the world and 
continues in almost every form today.

41
00:01:59,270 --> 00:02:02,240
This is one of the main issues that I 
wanted to discuss with Christina.

42
00:02:02,390 --> 00:02:05,030
How is the battle for equality evolved 
over the years?

43
00:02:05,150 --> 00:02:08,840
Have there been unintended consequences 
by coming so far in the battle?

44
00:02:09,470 --> 00:02:13,460
Has Feminism morphed into something that
feminist of the 19 sixties wouldn't even

45
00:02:13,461 --> 00:02:14,294
recognize today?
And what happens when an equality 

46
00:02:16,821 --> 00:02:19,520
movement actually accomplishes its 
goals?

47
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:22,970
Do we move on to what's next?
There's the battle never truly end.

48
00:02:23,270 --> 00:02:24,103
As you can see,
I've got a lot of questions and I hope 

49
00:02:25,401 --> 00:02:27,410
Christina has some of the answers.
For me,

50
00:02:27,411 --> 00:02:28,244
the battle for women's rights is the 
same battle that has been fought by the 

51
00:02:30,501 --> 00:02:31,700
other for all time.

52
00:02:31,700 --> 00:02:34,760
I want women to have 100 percent of the 
opportunity that men have.

53
00:02:34,761 --> 00:02:37,970
I want the doors to be open and the 
glass ceiling to be shattered.

54
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:41,120
Winning these battles doesn't mean it 
has to come at the expense of men,

55
00:02:41,121 --> 00:02:41,954
nor does it mean that men should 
suddenly become less than women and at 

56
00:02:44,901 --> 00:02:45,734
the same time we should acknowledge the 
sexes are actually different and that's 

57
00:02:48,531 --> 00:02:51,410
okay too.
From our hunter gatherer days to today,

58
00:02:51,411 --> 00:02:52,244
gender roles have existed long before 
any of us pretending there aren't some 

59
00:02:55,821 --> 00:02:58,700
differences in the sexist won't 
magically make it true.

60
00:02:58,990 --> 00:02:59,823
Perhaps we can try to embrace these 
differences rather than tacking labels 

61
00:03:02,951 --> 00:03:03,784
on everyone and thinking that one 
group's equality can only come at the 

62
00:03:06,731 --> 00:03:07,564
expense of another group's opportunity.
If men are from Mars and women are from 

63
00:03:10,691 --> 00:03:11,524
Venus,
then perhaps it's time we brought both 

64
00:03:12,881 --> 00:03:13,714
sexes back to Earth.
My guest this week is a speaker and 

65
00:03:18,731 --> 00:03:21,880
author and host of the factual feminist 
on youtube.

66
00:03:22,180 --> 00:03:26,140
She's known as based mom by the 
Gamergate gang and just finished a three

67
00:03:26,141 --> 00:03:26,974
hour conversation with Joe Rogan,
so I hope you have a little something 

68
00:03:29,501 --> 00:03:31,300
left.
Christina Hoff sommers.

69
00:03:31,301 --> 00:03:33,280
Welcome to the show.
A lovely to be here.

70
00:03:33,510 --> 00:03:34,400
Do you have a little something?

71
00:03:34,550 --> 00:03:35,300
I do.
I do.

72
00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:36,410
I'm just getting started.

73
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:38,510
Yeah.
So did you did three?

74
00:03:38,511 --> 00:03:41,320
Did he go a little over?
Where were you with your long?

75
00:03:41,620 --> 00:03:45,610
Just his little man cave there.
It was the very cozy little studio.

76
00:03:45,820 --> 00:03:46,653
Well,
right before is that now we were saying 

77
00:03:47,171 --> 00:03:51,430
how there's this new gang sort of that 
has appeared sort of you,

78
00:03:51,460 --> 00:03:53,110
Joe,
Milo,

79
00:03:53,111 --> 00:03:53,944
me,
a few other people that sort of have 

80
00:03:55,091 --> 00:03:55,924
magically connected even though just 
months ago we really didn't know each 

81
00:03:59,141 --> 00:04:02,650
other and yet we're all talking about a 
lot of the same stuff.

82
00:04:02,651 --> 00:04:03,310
It's pretty cool.

83
00:04:03,310 --> 00:04:03,860
Right?
Right.

84
00:04:03,860 --> 00:04:04,693
And,
and I think that what we are is we're 

85
00:04:06,041 --> 00:04:06,874
rejecting the cultural authoritarians 
and so we come from different political 

86
00:04:11,530 --> 00:04:12,363
places,
but we share this commitment to freedom 

87
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:17,260
and you know,
just live and let live.

88
00:04:17,261 --> 00:04:18,070
What happened to that?

89
00:04:18,070 --> 00:04:19,090
What happened to that?
All right,

90
00:04:19,091 --> 00:04:19,924
so I want to spend a lot of time talking
about the cultural libertarians and the 

91
00:04:23,321 --> 00:04:27,520
authoritarians and all of that stuff.
But first let's start somewhere else.

92
00:04:27,521 --> 00:04:28,354
Let's start with based mom because 
that's the phrase that popped up many 

93
00:04:30,581 --> 00:04:33,460
times and I see people tweeting this.
Anytime I'm involved in a,

94
00:04:33,461 --> 00:04:35,500
in a twitter thing with you based on 
what is,

95
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:37,570
what does that actually mean for the 
person?

96
00:04:37,571 --> 00:04:38,030
That

97
00:04:38,030 --> 00:04:41,420
first I thought it meant cool mom and I 
was happy with that,

98
00:04:41,421 --> 00:04:42,254
but it turns out it means something very
positive and just as good but different 

99
00:04:45,980 --> 00:04:46,813
in the lingo of the gamers and maybe 
they got it from a rap song or 

100
00:04:50,331 --> 00:04:52,850
something,
but based means grounded,

101
00:04:52,940 --> 00:04:56,000
authentic,
no bs they would say.

102
00:04:56,570 --> 00:04:57,403
And I'm.
So that's what I am and I'm happy to be 

103
00:04:59,151 --> 00:05:00,500
based mom.
I like being a mom,

104
00:05:00,501 --> 00:05:01,334
which I am.
And being based is obviously a good 

105
00:05:02,871 --> 00:05:03,704
things.

106
00:05:04,020 --> 00:05:05,010
There you go.
All right.

107
00:05:05,011 --> 00:05:06,360
So,
uh,

108
00:05:06,361 --> 00:05:08,430
so let's start with the factual 
feminist.

109
00:05:08,460 --> 00:05:09,293
Let's go there first.
I want to do a little history of 

110
00:05:10,411 --> 00:05:11,244
feminism,
but what brought you personally to be 

111
00:05:14,311 --> 00:05:17,280
doing these types of videos and talking 
about this stuff?

112
00:05:17,281 --> 00:05:18,114
Just your journey a little.

113
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,350
Well,
I've always been a,

114
00:05:20,690 --> 00:05:24,610
I was a professor for many years and 
wrote skull scholarly articles and books

115
00:05:24,611 --> 00:05:29,611
and I wasn't doing videos on youtube.
I thought that was at the time I thought

116
00:05:29,681 --> 00:05:30,690
it was about,
I don't know,

117
00:05:30,700 --> 00:05:33,120
cats.
It's still mostly,

118
00:05:33,380 --> 00:05:34,660
but it's still mostly cat.
Yeah.

119
00:05:35,230 --> 00:05:36,063
And um,
but this young man came to a Gi and 

120
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:41,433
wanted to get the scholars on the air 
and he did videos with all of us and 

121
00:05:44,621 --> 00:05:46,030
then he came to me and said,
you,

122
00:05:46,250 --> 00:05:48,400
we want to put you on,
I want you to have a weekly show,

123
00:05:48,401 --> 00:05:51,420
just come and talk.
And I said about what,

124
00:05:51,421 --> 00:05:52,790
what are you talking about?
And he said,

125
00:05:52,860 --> 00:05:57,860
it's no more than five minutes 
preferably for and how do I do that?

126
00:05:58,550 --> 00:06:00,290
But I started to do it and I thought,
okay,

127
00:06:00,380 --> 00:06:04,430
once a week approximately,
I will go on and correct a feminist myth

128
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:05,930
because there are so many.

129
00:06:06,230 --> 00:06:07,063
And I just wanted the opportunity to 
reason with people to analyze some of 

130
00:06:11,511 --> 00:06:13,520
these factoids,
factoids.

131
00:06:13,521 --> 00:06:16,240
We are in an inundated with ms dot 
information,

132
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:19,130
if you excuse the pun,
just false information about women.

133
00:06:19,490 --> 00:06:21,470
They tend to exaggerate.
They,

134
00:06:21,471 --> 00:06:22,304
these researchers slash activist tend to
exaggerate women's vulnerability and to 

135
00:06:26,151 --> 00:06:26,984
overstate the strength of men when in 
fact it's a complicated mix of benefits 

136
00:06:31,101 --> 00:06:34,610
and burdens for both sexes.
And so when they say,

137
00:06:34,611 --> 00:06:35,444
oh,
women are being cheated out of twenty 

138
00:06:37,970 --> 00:06:42,350
three cents on the dollar and one for 
being sexually assaulted,

139
00:06:42,890 --> 00:06:43,723
it just turns out these ridiculous 
exaggerations and the truth is entirely 

140
00:06:49,371 --> 00:06:50,204
different.
And so I just patiently tried to expose 

141
00:06:54,710 --> 00:06:56,060
the myths.
When I first started,

142
00:06:56,061 --> 00:06:57,890
my mother said,
well darling,

143
00:06:57,891 --> 00:06:59,840
are you going to run out of topics?
I said,

144
00:06:59,841 --> 00:07:00,674
mom,
I will never run out of topics because 

145
00:07:01,941 --> 00:07:04,400
we have had going on,
you know,

146
00:07:04,401 --> 00:07:05,234
three decades of specious research 
coming out of gender studies and it all 

147
00:07:10,491 --> 00:07:12,770
needs to be reconsidered.
Some of it might be right.

148
00:07:12,771 --> 00:07:13,850
I,
I occasionally,

149
00:07:13,851 --> 00:07:18,851
I find something that's not a just 
twisted into I'm a myth.

150
00:07:21,951 --> 00:07:24,950
And so I,
I correct a myth every week.

151
00:07:25,050 --> 00:07:25,883
Yeah.
So before we dive right into the 

152
00:07:26,831 --> 00:07:28,990
feminist of how do you like being in 
this space,

153
00:07:29,020 --> 00:07:29,853
because obviously it is new to you to be
in the youtube space and interacting 

154
00:07:32,741 --> 00:07:37,741
with people and twitter and all that.
I mean,

155
00:07:38,110 --> 00:07:41,230
did you ever expect to be sort of a hero
to the Gamer gay community?

156
00:07:41,231 --> 00:07:42,064
I want to talk about that later too,
but just being in this interesting 

157
00:07:43,961 --> 00:07:45,300
digital,
new thing.

158
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:46,230
No,
no,

159
00:07:46,231 --> 00:07:47,064
I didn't think I would.
I remember a few years ago before I was 

160
00:07:50,851 --> 00:07:51,870
on twitter,
I said,

161
00:07:51,871 --> 00:07:52,710
oh,
I'll never do that.

162
00:07:52,711 --> 00:07:54,180
I don't know how to do that.
I just,

163
00:07:54,181 --> 00:07:56,520
it was unapproachable.
Well now I can't get off.

164
00:07:57,090 --> 00:07:59,450
It's so addicting.
But um,

165
00:07:59,820 --> 00:08:00,653
I didn't expect it,
but I'm happy to do it because here's 

166
00:08:02,341 --> 00:08:04,110
the thing about that I like about 
twitter,

167
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:05,113
so I don't just give a message,
I link if people are interested and try 

168
00:08:08,321 --> 00:08:09,154
to back up everything I say with solid 
scholarship and link I linked to the 

169
00:08:12,001 --> 00:08:12,834
best sources I can find or to my own 
work that I've done for over the 

170
00:08:16,860 --> 00:08:17,693
decades.
So I linked to books and articles if 

171
00:08:18,661 --> 00:08:20,300
people are interested.
So it's,

172
00:08:20,330 --> 00:08:22,560
it's as if all of my writing has a new 
life.

173
00:08:22,660 --> 00:08:24,310
Yeah.
And it's also very validating,

174
00:08:24,311 --> 00:08:25,144
I think to be in the space that we are 
when there's so much misinformation 

175
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:28,953
related to whatever,
whether it's feminism or political 

176
00:08:31,001 --> 00:08:33,490
correctness or any of that.
And there's so many bad actors.

177
00:08:33,491 --> 00:08:36,670
I think in this space,
so it's angry people,

178
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:37,833
but,
but for us it's nice that we can be 

179
00:08:38,681 --> 00:08:39,160
like,
look,

180
00:08:39,160 --> 00:08:42,490
here's some information and then we can 
go back and forth when we want and it's,

181
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:43,720
it's,
uh,

182
00:08:43,900 --> 00:08:46,570
it's very freeing to me.
I find and then when I'm able to connect

183
00:08:46,571 --> 00:08:48,670
with like minded people,
I find it to be great.

184
00:08:48,790 --> 00:08:52,600
I find it great and all I ever wanted as
a college professor,

185
00:08:52,601 --> 00:08:53,434
I never saw it as my position to sort of
replicate my view of the world in the 

186
00:08:57,721 --> 00:09:01,050
minds of my students.
Heaven forbid I wanted to open the world

187
00:09:01,051 --> 00:09:01,884
to them,
show them the best that was thought and 

188
00:09:03,811 --> 00:09:04,644
said on different contentious issues in,
in metaphysics and ethics as well as 

189
00:09:08,341 --> 00:09:09,174
when,
when I was teaching occasionally would 

190
00:09:10,471 --> 00:09:13,320
teach gender theory.
But when I taught gender theory,

191
00:09:13,321 --> 00:09:15,370
I found that there was the,
the,

192
00:09:15,380 --> 00:09:16,213
the closed mindedness combined with a 
kind of a pension for conspiracy 

193
00:09:20,821 --> 00:09:24,420
theories,
paranoid theories about the patriarchy.

194
00:09:24,421 --> 00:09:26,160
That didn't happen.
It's not to exist,

195
00:09:26,161 --> 00:09:28,890
at least not certainly not in the United
States or western Europe.

196
00:09:29,430 --> 00:09:30,263
And,
uh,

197
00:09:30,630 --> 00:09:35,160
I just,
I thought if I had my ideal university,

198
00:09:35,161 --> 00:09:37,350
I would take,
I would have some radicals there because

199
00:09:37,351 --> 00:09:39,690
you can always learn from people that 
are pushing the envelope.

200
00:09:39,730 --> 00:09:40,563
Sure.
But you don't only have radicals and 

201
00:09:41,810 --> 00:09:44,640
engender scholarship,
it may be a bit of an overstatement,

202
00:09:44,641 --> 00:09:46,950
but I don't think so really.
That's all we have.

203
00:09:47,030 --> 00:09:48,710
Okay.
So before we get told that,

204
00:09:48,711 --> 00:09:49,544
let's back up a little,
let's just lay out some basic 

205
00:09:51,141 --> 00:09:51,974
definitions because I do find that with 
a lot of these people don't even 

206
00:09:54,081 --> 00:09:56,090
understand what a feminist is anymore.
You know,

207
00:09:56,091 --> 00:09:58,130
you have your first wave feminist or 
second wave feminist,

208
00:09:58,131 --> 00:10:01,440
third wave feminists.
Now there's things beyond that that,

209
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:03,410
that you've coined.
I'm so,

210
00:10:03,411 --> 00:10:05,170
can you just break down some of the 
basic what,

211
00:10:05,171 --> 00:10:07,220
what,
what was the first feminist movement?

212
00:10:07,410 --> 00:10:08,570
Just give me a couple.

213
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:09,753
Well,
that would be the suffrage movement and 

214
00:10:11,891 --> 00:10:16,120
that was the struggle for the vote.
And then after,

215
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:18,760
when women earn the vote,
uh,

216
00:10:18,820 --> 00:10:19,653
there was a period of queen essence and 
we didn't hear much from feminists 

217
00:10:22,361 --> 00:10:24,000
throughout the thirties,
forties,

218
00:10:24,070 --> 00:10:27,400
fifties.
And it came back in the late sixties,

219
00:10:27,430 --> 00:10:28,263
early seventies,
and that was the second wave and it had 

220
00:10:30,221 --> 00:10:31,054
worked to do.
There were a lot of just arbitrary 

221
00:10:32,711 --> 00:10:36,490
barriers preventing women holding women 
back.

222
00:10:36,491 --> 00:10:39,940
They needed to be taken down.
It was obviously time to do that.

223
00:10:39,950 --> 00:10:42,350
And this was more like in the workforce,
things like that.

224
00:10:42,570 --> 00:10:45,000
Changing the workplace,
changing education.

225
00:10:45,540 --> 00:10:48,330
I'm addressing things of,
uh,

226
00:10:48,420 --> 00:10:49,253
you know,
legally for women to have more defenses 

227
00:10:51,691 --> 00:10:54,030
against harassment in the workplace and 
so forth.

228
00:10:54,300 --> 00:10:56,580
All of that.
I was totally on board.

229
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:57,473
That's just basic quest for equality.
But what happened is that the second 

230
00:11:03,451 --> 00:11:04,284
wave of feminism,
a lot of the women in the universities 

231
00:11:07,260 --> 00:11:10,680
were quite radical and they were not 
about equality.

232
00:11:11,010 --> 00:11:12,870
They were not about,
I see feminism,

233
00:11:12,871 --> 00:11:13,704
the best of feminism.
It came from the European enlightenment 

234
00:11:15,660 --> 00:11:16,493
and it was about the intrinsic dignity 
of all men and women and extending 

235
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:24,500
equality of opportunity and liberty and 
so forth to,

236
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:28,050
to all they,
many of them rejecting enlightenment.

237
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:30,870
And they're not about freedom and 
freedom of expression.

238
00:11:30,871 --> 00:11:34,620
And they are really.
They use their classrooms,

239
00:11:34,621 --> 00:11:35,454
I think,
to promote a very rigid worldview about 

240
00:11:38,041 --> 00:11:38,874
how women are preyed upon by men and 
it's almost as if the as if better 

241
00:11:41,881 --> 00:11:44,700
things got for women,
the more bitter they became,

242
00:11:45,180 --> 00:11:46,013
and I watched this from close up because
I was teaching in the University of 

243
00:11:48,900 --> 00:11:49,733
Washington.
I kept thinking they would be 

244
00:11:50,161 --> 00:11:50,994
discredited because it their views will 
not withstand 20 minutes in a seminar 

245
00:11:55,841 --> 00:11:56,674
room with some just objective scholars,
but they do not subject their research 

246
00:12:02,020 --> 00:12:06,520
to scrutiny of objective scholars.
They receive the evaluate one another.

247
00:12:06,610 --> 00:12:07,443
Right?
So was this a strange example of where 

248
00:12:08,561 --> 00:12:09,394
things could exist sort of in the 
academic world where perhaps they 

249
00:12:12,611 --> 00:12:13,444
wouldn't.
These ideas wouldn't have played out in 

250
00:12:14,501 --> 00:12:14,960
the real world?

251
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:16,970
Well,
they didn't and I didn't see them in the

252
00:12:16,971 --> 00:12:17,804
real world and I thought they would be 
contained in the academy and then would 

253
00:12:21,171 --> 00:12:22,004
go away.
That has not happened because partly 

254
00:12:24,501 --> 00:12:27,680
because of social media and these 
twitter mobs and things.

255
00:12:27,681 --> 00:12:32,681
It's come into the mainstream and now we
hear these words like trigger warning or

256
00:12:34,261 --> 00:12:37,400
we're going to get plenty of that issue 
to trigger warning before we sat down.

257
00:12:37,430 --> 00:12:38,150
Oh,
we should have.

258
00:12:38,150 --> 00:12:40,280
Yes,
I am a walking trigger warning.

259
00:12:41,990 --> 00:12:45,770
Do you consider this a safe space?
I'm feeling fairly,

260
00:12:46,130 --> 00:12:49,010
fairly frequently.
Little microaggressive pond,

261
00:12:49,011 --> 00:12:50,120
but not so much.

262
00:12:50,850 --> 00:12:51,481
Um,
okay.

263
00:12:51,481 --> 00:12:53,940
So then that was,
that was second wave feminism,

264
00:12:53,941 --> 00:12:54,730
right.
That's a good way.

265
00:12:54,730 --> 00:12:55,760
Was involved into that

266
00:12:56,050 --> 00:12:56,883
second wave had a radical extreme and 
that extreme became the mean because 

267
00:13:01,841 --> 00:13:04,090
they got a monopoly on the,
uh,

268
00:13:04,330 --> 00:13:05,180
professorships

269
00:13:05,790 --> 00:13:08,120
and that's what you would refer to them 
as third wave feminism.

270
00:13:08,130 --> 00:13:08,670
The third.
Yeah.

271
00:13:08,670 --> 00:13:11,790
Third way was probably the 
intersectional feminism.

272
00:13:11,820 --> 00:13:15,470
Are there various names for it,
but it's a,

273
00:13:15,750 --> 00:13:18,990
it didn't correct the excesses of second
wave feminism.

274
00:13:19,230 --> 00:13:22,080
It took those excesses and made them 
even more extreme.

275
00:13:22,170 --> 00:13:22,681
Yeah.
Now,

276
00:13:22,681 --> 00:13:23,850
what would you say to the people that 
would say,

277
00:13:23,851 --> 00:13:25,410
well,
all along that ride,

278
00:13:25,770 --> 00:13:26,603
even though even if they were to 
acknowledge some of the things that 

279
00:13:28,081 --> 00:13:29,670
you're saying all along that ride 
things,

280
00:13:29,671 --> 00:13:31,710
basically we're getting better for 
women.

281
00:13:31,711 --> 00:13:34,320
So maybe there was some reasoning 
behind,

282
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:35,273
you know,

283
00:13:35,510 --> 00:13:36,343
there was some reasoning,
but at a certain point what you had is 

284
00:13:38,810 --> 00:13:39,643
just people.
It was kind of a power grab and there 

285
00:13:42,801 --> 00:13:46,340
were women like me can cal poly a lot of
libertarian feminist,

286
00:13:46,341 --> 00:13:47,210
dissonant,
feminist.

287
00:13:47,211 --> 00:13:48,044
We were just disinvited from to a party 
and students didn't have the benefit of 

288
00:13:52,851 --> 00:13:56,000
hearing a range of opinion and 
contentious issues.

289
00:13:56,240 --> 00:14:00,610
Take something like something like the 
wage gap it.

290
00:14:01,220 --> 00:14:02,053
If you are an economist and you hear 
that group a is earning less than 

291
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:06,050
Groupie,
you know,

292
00:14:06,051 --> 00:14:09,890
you want to know why they immediately 
say discrimination.

293
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:10,793
They blame employers and the patriarchy.
But if you do the proper controls that 

294
00:14:14,751 --> 00:14:16,850
any competent economist would do and you
ask,

295
00:14:16,851 --> 00:14:18,740
well,
how do they differ in any way?

296
00:14:18,741 --> 00:14:20,900
Do all the men.
Because when you hear that wage gap,

297
00:14:20,901 --> 00:14:21,734
they're just doing the average of all 
the men in the workplace working full 

298
00:14:23,651 --> 00:14:26,030
time and all the women,
well,

299
00:14:26,510 --> 00:14:29,780
men and women do not study the same top 
subjects in college.

300
00:14:30,110 --> 00:14:32,010
They do not work the same number of 
hours.

301
00:14:32,011 --> 00:14:34,910
And then on average work more hours.
They take more dangerous jobs,

302
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:39,200
women are far more likely to take a few 
years out of the workplace or more.

303
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:40,513
These are relevant to your earnings.
So then what happens when we do the 

304
00:14:44,301 --> 00:14:46,730
proper controls and they're very good 
studies.

305
00:14:46,740 --> 00:14:47,201
The,
the,

306
00:14:47,201 --> 00:14:48,034
the Labor Department commissioned a 
fantastic study that did all proper 

307
00:14:51,381 --> 00:14:52,214
controls.
It gets to a point where they're just a 

308
00:14:53,751 --> 00:14:54,584
few cents you can't explain now.
It could be discrimination and I'm 

309
00:14:57,620 --> 00:15:01,340
enough of an equity feminist or worry 
about that if I've been cheated out of a

310
00:15:01,340 --> 00:15:04,430
few pennies or a woman are,
but chances are it's not.

311
00:15:04,970 --> 00:15:08,600
Chances are it would turn out if some 
innocent explanation.

312
00:15:08,660 --> 00:15:09,500
Yeah.
So,

313
00:15:09,590 --> 00:15:10,423
uh,
when it comes to the wage gaps and 

314
00:15:11,361 --> 00:15:12,194
things like that.
So I watched the whole bunch of videos 

315
00:15:13,041 --> 00:15:14,630
on it before I watched the video,
did it,

316
00:15:14,690 --> 00:15:15,523
you did on it before this.
And partly what I think is what I think 

317
00:15:19,221 --> 00:15:20,054
when I watch most political things or a 
almost anything related to news these 

318
00:15:23,630 --> 00:15:25,160
days,
I never knew who to trust.

319
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:27,590
But I watch these studies.
I say this study,

320
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:29,630
well why was it done this way?
Who funded this?

321
00:15:29,631 --> 00:15:32,810
Who funded that?
How do you in the mix of all this,

322
00:15:32,811 --> 00:15:35,060
figure out what to actually believe

323
00:15:35,250 --> 00:15:37,080
what I do,
excuse me,

324
00:15:37,081 --> 00:15:39,270
as the factual feminist,
I tried to determine,

325
00:15:39,570 --> 00:15:40,230
well,
where,

326
00:15:40,230 --> 00:15:41,063
who's the best source?
Whereas who sets the gold standard for 

327
00:15:43,741 --> 00:15:47,820
this research?
So when it comes to education,

328
00:15:48,150 --> 00:15:50,200
nothing surpasses the,
uh,

329
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:53,550
the Department of Education and the 
Department of Education,

330
00:15:53,730 --> 00:15:54,563
they collect statistics and they,
they are very good when it comes to 

331
00:15:57,271 --> 00:15:58,104
crime.
Do I believe a feminist activist that 

332
00:16:00,211 --> 00:16:01,800
tells me that we're all,
you know,

333
00:16:01,810 --> 00:16:02,643
the majority of women or,
or a quarter of women are being raped 

334
00:16:05,011 --> 00:16:07,800
and assaulted and battered or more,
um,

335
00:16:08,660 --> 00:16:11,250
I go to the Bureau of Justice Statistics
and look at what the,

336
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:12,113
what do the statisticians who do careful
and highly disciplined as statistical 

337
00:16:19,651 --> 00:16:21,120
analyses,
what do they find?

338
00:16:21,210 --> 00:16:22,043
And they find it something very 
different and they find out the rape is 

339
00:16:24,601 --> 00:16:26,130
a terrible,
horrendous crime.

340
00:16:26,460 --> 00:16:31,460
But it is fairly rare on the campus is 
not one in four and a or one in five.

341
00:16:32,460 --> 00:16:34,740
And,
and so I present that.

342
00:16:34,741 --> 00:16:35,574
I show people this is what they.
These are what sort of objective 

343
00:16:39,270 --> 00:16:42,150
researchers have found.
These are what the advocates have found.

344
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:43,193
Now,
some people just want to believe the 

345
00:16:44,221 --> 00:16:45,750
advocates.
I don't understand that.

346
00:16:45,830 --> 00:16:46,461
Yeah.
All right,

347
00:16:46,461 --> 00:16:48,500
well I do want to touch on that in a 
little bit,

348
00:16:48,501 --> 00:16:52,040
but just to finish up just sort of the 
waves of feminism now.

349
00:16:52,041 --> 00:16:53,720
You consider yourself and you coined the
phrase,

350
00:16:53,721 --> 00:16:54,920
I think equity,
feminist,

351
00:16:54,930 --> 00:16:56,350
right.
Can tell people.

352
00:16:56,420 --> 00:16:58,880
So an equity feminist.
I hope you are.

353
00:16:58,881 --> 00:16:59,714
We all are.
Is someone who wants for women what he 

354
00:17:01,581 --> 00:17:04,070
or she wants for everyone?
Fair treatment?

355
00:17:04,071 --> 00:17:06,650
No discrimination.
It's basically comes,

356
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:08,090
as I said,
from the enlightenment.

357
00:17:08,091 --> 00:17:11,000
It's classical feminism.
It's about fairness.

358
00:17:11,330 --> 00:17:14,120
It doesn't even have to be called 
feminism.

359
00:17:14,121 --> 00:17:19,121
It's probably humanism or people ism or 
equalism had I.

360
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:23,510
that's what I assumed most people would 
be for today.

361
00:17:23,780 --> 00:17:28,780
Feminism tends to denote people who are 
carried away with bail bashing.

362
00:17:30,350 --> 00:17:32,750
If I had to reduce it to a few 
sentences,

363
00:17:32,751 --> 00:17:33,584
it would be a women are from Venus and 
men are from hell and they seem carried 

364
00:17:37,041 --> 00:17:38,440
away with,
with,

365
00:17:38,530 --> 00:17:39,830
you know,
female chauvinism.

366
00:17:39,831 --> 00:17:40,664
I hate to say it.

367
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:41,730
Okay,
so from there.

368
00:17:41,731 --> 00:17:42,564
Now let's.
Let's backtrack to what you just said 

369
00:17:44,071 --> 00:17:46,620
about the campus stuff,
because I know this is a place where you

370
00:17:46,621 --> 00:17:47,454
get a lot of heat for this.
When you've talked about the rape 

371
00:17:49,291 --> 00:17:49,850
situation

372
00:17:49,850 --> 00:17:50,683
to overland college and everyone was 
triggered and 30 people and a dog fled 

373
00:17:55,671 --> 00:17:58,220
to a safe space.
They had a safe room.

374
00:17:58,221 --> 00:17:59,054
There was a therapy dog apparently and 
30 triggered young women and they went 

375
00:18:02,181 --> 00:18:05,190
to a safe room and they were so.

376
00:18:05,290 --> 00:18:07,360
Which we try to plate,
parse that out.

377
00:18:07,361 --> 00:18:09,220
What I mean,
what does that actually mean?

378
00:18:09,221 --> 00:18:09,971
Because I know,
I know,

379
00:18:09,971 --> 00:18:12,340
we know what it means and we joke about 
this stuff.

380
00:18:12,510 --> 00:18:16,400
I wish I didn't know what they literally
because you were coming to speak,

381
00:18:16,650 --> 00:18:17,483
that I would give them ptsd now.
I have been lecturing on campuses for 

382
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:22,113
years and it used to be they'd come and 
argue and sometimes we part as friends 

383
00:18:26,371 --> 00:18:27,204
or go to a bar and you know,
kind of have a good time to like human 

384
00:18:29,431 --> 00:18:30,264
beings.
And if someone presents me with some 

385
00:18:32,101 --> 00:18:34,710
good data and good arguments,
I'll change my mind.

386
00:18:34,711 --> 00:18:37,500
I've changed my mind many times that I 
look forward to doing it again,

387
00:18:38,180 --> 00:18:39,013
but who they are,
we're not just something has changed in 

388
00:18:41,281 --> 00:18:45,630
the last few years on the campus and 
there's been this medicalization of,

389
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:46,753
of the,
of the curriculum and they need trigger 

390
00:18:48,601 --> 00:18:51,000
warnings for their classes and trigger 
warnings for this and that.

391
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:52,433
And as I said,
they needed them for me and they needed 

392
00:18:54,391 --> 00:18:58,140
a safe space where they could retreat 
because as one of them put it,

393
00:18:58,141 --> 00:19:00,990
someone would be invalidating my 
experience.

394
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:03,180
It's like the worst thing that can 
happen to you.

395
00:19:03,210 --> 00:19:04,043
Right?
So it wasn't like a good thing to 

396
00:19:04,861 --> 00:19:05,694
happen.
And then because you can't just go by 

397
00:19:07,321 --> 00:19:09,800
your experience,
you have to test it and,

398
00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:13,680
and see if your interpretation holds up 
to criticism.

399
00:19:13,890 --> 00:19:17,490
They were not interested in,
in any kind of criticism.

400
00:19:17,610 --> 00:19:19,110
Right?
So when,

401
00:19:19,230 --> 00:19:23,190
when you hear this happen are new and 
you see this happen to you and you say,

402
00:19:23,191 --> 00:19:24,024
okay,
here's the empirical evidence about 

403
00:19:24,991 --> 00:19:29,690
what's happening with rape on campus.
And then they say what?

404
00:19:29,710 --> 00:19:30,543
What is their counter argument?
Is the counter argument that there's 

405
00:19:32,910 --> 00:19:34,710
more rape that goes under reported for 
x,

406
00:19:34,711 --> 00:19:36,600
Y,
or Z or they're not counting,

407
00:19:36,900 --> 00:19:39,560
you know,
girls that got drugged or,

408
00:19:39,561 --> 00:19:40,410
or something.
I mean,

409
00:19:40,411 --> 00:19:41,244
what's the,
I get that we've become this society 

410
00:19:43,171 --> 00:19:45,450
that's afraid of every bit of 
information,

411
00:19:45,451 --> 00:19:46,360
but what's the counter?

412
00:19:46,580 --> 00:19:48,630
Yeah,
well they cite their own studies,

413
00:19:49,020 --> 00:19:49,853
but I've spent many years and so many 
other people looking at these 

414
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:55,330
methodological failures.
If you,

415
00:19:55,470 --> 00:19:59,670
there are ways in which I could,
we could throw together a survey tonight

416
00:20:00,040 --> 00:20:03,630
and ask people questions and find an 
epidemic of whatever you want.

417
00:20:03,810 --> 00:20:07,620
All you have to do is ask questions that
are a little vague and it helps to,

418
00:20:07,621 --> 00:20:11,060
to ask a non representative sample of 
people and um,

419
00:20:12,030 --> 00:20:13,010
that's what they do.
They ask,

420
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:16,950
they usually a mix of serious questions,
but then a few vague ones.

421
00:20:17,430 --> 00:20:18,990
That's all you need.
Now,

422
00:20:19,020 --> 00:20:20,820
does it mean your study is going to be 
valid?

423
00:20:20,821 --> 00:20:21,654
No.
Does it mean you're going to generate 

424
00:20:22,651 --> 00:20:24,930
some useful propaganda for your cars?
Yes.

425
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:25,810
Yeah.
Alright.

426
00:20:25,810 --> 00:20:29,080
So I saw that,
that piece it at Oberlin.

427
00:20:29,320 --> 00:20:33,310
And then the other thing that I saw you 
got heat for was um,

428
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:34,990
the,
the cat calling,

429
00:20:35,320 --> 00:20:36,290
right?
There was this,

430
00:20:36,291 --> 00:20:39,760
this video about cat calling and you've 
sort of said,

431
00:20:40,060 --> 00:20:42,940
we're written about that.
This is not really a thing,

432
00:20:43,570 --> 00:20:45,130
not really thing that,
well it exists,

433
00:20:45,131 --> 00:20:47,080
but not a thing to be upset by sort.

434
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:49,170
Well,
it's complicated and as I said,

435
00:20:49,171 --> 00:20:51,210
there are times where it's very 
threatening,

436
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:55,140
but you have to make distinctions and 
this is the basis of thought.

437
00:20:55,180 --> 00:20:56,970
I mean,
human rationality,

438
00:20:56,971 --> 00:21:00,360
making distinctions and being out in the
public square,

439
00:21:00,361 --> 00:21:03,090
there are going to be interactions,
you know,

440
00:21:03,100 --> 00:21:05,700
people will come up with petitions,
people beg for money,

441
00:21:05,701 --> 00:21:09,060
people will say things.
It's just part of being alive.

442
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:15,080
And these control freaks think that we 
can police everything that's said on the

443
00:21:15,211 --> 00:21:19,350
street and they were actually suggesting
that it be against the law to cat call a

444
00:21:19,351 --> 00:21:20,490
woman.
Well,

445
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:21,353
again,
I make a distinction between somebody 

446
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:23,220
saying hi,
beautiful.

447
00:21:23,221 --> 00:21:24,150
I mean,
frankly,

448
00:21:24,151 --> 00:21:25,290
that wouldn't bother me.

449
00:21:27,300 --> 00:21:28,560
It might have bothered me when I was 
younger,

450
00:21:28,561 --> 00:21:30,420
but as you get older you don't mind.
Uh,

451
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:35,580
but when I wish somebody saying 
something disgusting or frightening that

452
00:21:35,610 --> 00:21:38,190
is very or stalking you,
that's very different,

453
00:21:38,550 --> 00:21:39,480
but they,
they,

454
00:21:39,690 --> 00:21:44,690
to them it's all the same.
It's all a micro or macro aggression and

455
00:21:44,971 --> 00:21:47,090
they want a law against it.
And,

456
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:51,300
and what I pointed out my video is that 
in Washington DC,

457
00:21:51,301 --> 00:21:55,710
there's a place where you can walk and 
you will be cat called and I have walked

458
00:21:55,711 --> 00:21:56,544
there many times and it's in a very busy
part near dupont circle and it's a lot 

459
00:21:59,941 --> 00:22:02,070
of women dressed for success.
You know,

460
00:22:02,071 --> 00:22:04,920
when their Manolo blahniks they're 
walking through and the men,

461
00:22:06,300 --> 00:22:11,300
well the men are homeless people living 
in this park and they make comments.

462
00:22:12,150 --> 00:22:15,900
So there is a huge class difference 
between these women.

463
00:22:16,030 --> 00:22:21,030
Are we supposed to think these women 
need to be protected from these guys who

464
00:22:21,211 --> 00:22:22,470
are the have nots?

465
00:22:22,820 --> 00:22:23,653
Right.
So that's an interesting discrepancy 

466
00:22:24,561 --> 00:22:25,394
that it's not Wall Street bankers 
walking down the street making these 

467
00:22:27,951 --> 00:22:31,020
comments were.
Then there's sort of an added layer of,

468
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:34,810
of a financial difference in social 
status and all that.

469
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:40,000
It's usually coming from people beneath,
I suppose not always offered it and gave

470
00:22:42,430 --> 00:22:44,080
that enough to dismiss it.
As,

471
00:22:44,210 --> 00:22:45,440
you know.
I get what you're saying.

472
00:22:45,441 --> 00:22:46,274
There's a wild discrepancy between you.
You're cuter whistling at a girl or 

473
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:51,490
versus leering and following you.
I

474
00:22:51,490 --> 00:22:54,880
think men should know that it bothers 
women.

475
00:22:54,881 --> 00:22:56,600
I'm not sure it bothers all women.
I mean,

476
00:22:56,610 --> 00:22:58,360
I think it depends on the woman and you 
know,

477
00:22:58,780 --> 00:23:00,330
it's very complicated.
Yeah.

478
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:01,353
I don't want the women who were the most
hypersensitive and for sort of freaked 

479
00:23:06,791 --> 00:23:07,624
out about male attention.
I don't think they should be able to 

480
00:23:10,361 --> 00:23:13,420
write the rules.
I think they should consult other women.

481
00:23:13,990 --> 00:23:17,290
What I suspect you would find is that it
can be annoying.

482
00:23:17,410 --> 00:23:18,161
I mean,
as I said,

483
00:23:18,161 --> 00:23:20,500
I remember being younger and being 
annoyed,

484
00:23:20,501 --> 00:23:22,150
but it was mainly a.
well,

485
00:23:22,180 --> 00:23:23,920
there were,
I mean,

486
00:23:24,310 --> 00:23:27,460
it didn't happen that much on Wall 
Street or in,

487
00:23:27,550 --> 00:23:28,720
in,
in Manhattan,

488
00:23:28,721 --> 00:23:29,554
but um,
so there did seem to be an element of a 

489
00:23:33,490 --> 00:23:35,610
class involved,
but I,

490
00:23:35,611 --> 00:23:38,350
but I think you have to,
you know,

491
00:23:38,351 --> 00:23:41,710
I think in different cultures the women 
react to it differently.

492
00:23:41,711 --> 00:23:45,530
There are different mores and things.
But in my neighborhood in Washington,

493
00:23:45,531 --> 00:23:46,364
D,
c,

494
00:23:46,430 --> 00:23:48,440
I don't see it happening and where I 
live.

495
00:23:48,670 --> 00:23:51,610
So basically what I sense is you're,
you're pretty much saying that your fear

496
00:23:51,611 --> 00:23:52,444
in this would be that if you were to 
allow some laws to be passed related to 

497
00:23:55,931 --> 00:23:59,650
all this stuff that you're handing the 
power over sort of the authoritarian

498
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:01,233
police.
They can arrest anybody and it would be 

499
00:24:03,321 --> 00:24:04,120
these.
I mean,

500
00:24:04,120 --> 00:24:06,520
I think in dc it would be these poor 
guys.

501
00:24:07,090 --> 00:24:08,600
And uh,
so I,

502
00:24:08,660 --> 00:24:10,030
I think,
you know,

503
00:24:10,230 --> 00:24:11,063
most men want to be decent human beings 
and they should know women don't 

504
00:24:13,781 --> 00:24:18,781
appreciate it and that most don't.
And especially if it's in,

505
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:19,793
you know,
kind of pushy and certainly if it's 

506
00:24:22,001 --> 00:24:22,834
offensive,
but,

507
00:24:23,290 --> 00:24:24,123
but then you're not,
don't make laws and don't invite the 

508
00:24:26,441 --> 00:24:27,274
police in this is.
There's so much of this event inviting 

509
00:24:30,701 --> 00:24:33,730
authorities in and some have called it 
the pink police state,

510
00:24:33,900 --> 00:24:34,733
you know,
this feminist police state that we have 

511
00:24:35,681 --> 00:24:38,980
on campus where your kids and public 
universities,

512
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:40,473
the young men are afraid to tell a joke 
or to say anything that comedy clubs 

513
00:24:44,501 --> 00:24:47,110
that are afraid to sell they veteran,
they're unwelcome on campus.

514
00:24:47,111 --> 00:24:52,111
It's a hostile environment for humor.
And so that's why you have to be careful

515
00:24:52,541 --> 00:24:54,460
and sometimes you'll get what you wish 
for,

516
00:24:54,610 --> 00:24:56,890
but then you get a lot more.
You get a lot more repression,

517
00:24:57,050 --> 00:24:59,470
authoritarianism.
It's just not worth it.

518
00:24:59,500 --> 00:25:00,333
Yeah.
So it's some of that also that the 

519
00:25:02,051 --> 00:25:02,884
feminism movement has been a victim of 
its own success in a weird way because 

520
00:25:06,370 --> 00:25:07,203
it seems to me that feminist now should 
be fighting so much more for women's 

521
00:25:10,481 --> 00:25:11,890
rights in other countries.
Now,

522
00:25:11,891 --> 00:25:12,724
of course we have a long way to go here,
but when we see all kinds of horrible 

523
00:25:16,151 --> 00:25:17,440
things have,
you know,

524
00:25:17,470 --> 00:25:21,340
women still can't drive in Saudi Arabia,
one of our biggest allies in the Gulf,

525
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:22,233
you know,
this is not an enemy country and all 

526
00:25:24,881 --> 00:25:25,714
over the Middle East and all over Africa
where women's rights are basically 

527
00:25:27,761 --> 00:25:32,761
trampled on if not nonexistent.
Why don't feminists groups focus on that

528
00:25:32,771 --> 00:25:33,604
at all?

529
00:25:34,310 --> 00:25:38,430
You do have genuine patriarchal,
oppressive societies and and what what's

530
00:25:38,431 --> 00:25:43,070
happening to women's rights in Iran is 
terrifying of course in Saudi Arabia,

531
00:25:43,090 --> 00:25:43,923
many parts of the world.
I've been to international women's 

532
00:25:45,181 --> 00:25:50,160
conferences and you meet these women who
represent when then from their countries

533
00:25:50,161 --> 00:25:53,130
that I've met from Cambodia and Yemen 
and Egypt and so forth,

534
00:25:53,131 --> 00:25:53,964
and it's very inspiring.
It's like meeting the Elizabeth Cady 

535
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:57,833
Stanton and Susan B Anthony that the 
feminist foremothers of their society 

536
00:26:01,320 --> 00:26:04,380
and you would think that the know on the
campus,

537
00:26:04,381 --> 00:26:07,740
these young women would be especially 
young women that are idealistic and want

538
00:26:07,741 --> 00:26:08,574
to be activists.
You'd think they'd be making common 

539
00:26:10,051 --> 00:26:12,060
cause with those women.
Instead,

540
00:26:12,270 --> 00:26:14,420
these women had overland and Georgetown 
and you,

541
00:26:14,670 --> 00:26:18,560
they're protesting the men on their 
campus because they and they,

542
00:26:18,561 --> 00:26:20,410
they feel they are,
they,

543
00:26:20,500 --> 00:26:23,810
they feel that they are like these women
that are oppressed in,

544
00:26:23,910 --> 00:26:26,400
in Iran,
that they have it as bad or worse.

545
00:26:26,790 --> 00:26:28,620
So it's,
it's delusional.

546
00:26:28,760 --> 00:26:30,560
Yeah.
So I think there's something much bigger

547
00:26:30,561 --> 00:26:33,290
going on here and I think this is why so
much of our audience,

548
00:26:33,291 --> 00:26:34,124
especially on twitter,
likes what we're both doing and what 

549
00:26:36,201 --> 00:26:39,040
people like Joe Rogan a guide,
sad and then Milo,

550
00:26:39,210 --> 00:26:40,043
many others are talking about.
There's some weird movement of 

551
00:26:43,351 --> 00:26:44,184
Authoritarians were the left now,
which is supposed to be about free 

552
00:26:47,731 --> 00:26:48,564
thinking and debating ideas and doing 
this right where the left is now 

553
00:26:52,350 --> 00:26:53,183
throwing out half the people.
I had Sarah Haider I last week and this 

554
00:26:56,431 --> 00:26:59,160
is an ex Muslim who stands up for every 
liberal ideal.

555
00:26:59,480 --> 00:27:01,740
The left should love her and they shun 
her.

556
00:27:01,950 --> 00:27:03,810
At best they were actually treated worse
than,

557
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:04,673
than being shunned.

558
00:27:05,250 --> 00:27:07,880
When I wrote my first book,
which was protesting the,

559
00:27:08,170 --> 00:27:11,810
the authoritarianism of feminism and the
Anti Intellectual Ism,

560
00:27:11,820 --> 00:27:13,380
the conspiracy theories,
all of that.

561
00:27:13,970 --> 00:27:18,660
Uh,
I expected to have a good reception from

562
00:27:19,170 --> 00:27:20,003
feminist scholars because I just assumed
there was a silent minority of silent 

563
00:27:23,671 --> 00:27:26,310
majority of reasonable women.
And I did,

564
00:27:26,311 --> 00:27:28,120
I heard from some great women and from 
nate,

565
00:27:28,121 --> 00:27:31,520
nate [inaudible] and president of the 
then president of the Acl,

566
00:27:31,521 --> 00:27:32,860
you,
um,

567
00:27:32,910 --> 00:27:35,520
I heard from Erica Jong,
you know,

568
00:27:35,521 --> 00:27:38,640
this pro-sex feminine feminist novelist 
and sober and they were great,

569
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:39,953
but my colleagues in the academy were 
furious that I had criticized and they 

570
00:27:43,981 --> 00:27:44,814
thought that criticism was the same as a
kind of betrayal and show that you were 

571
00:27:50,310 --> 00:27:51,900
on the side,
the side of,

572
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:53,970
you know,
the forces of evil.

573
00:27:54,120 --> 00:27:55,860
So they didn't just agree,
disagree with you.

574
00:27:55,861 --> 00:27:58,650
They thought you were evil.
Now they don't just disagree with you,

575
00:27:58,651 --> 00:28:01,170
they think you're evil and that you give
them ptsd.

576
00:28:01,320 --> 00:28:02,153
Yes.
So you give the ptsd and then it also 

577
00:28:03,241 --> 00:28:08,241
doesn't give them a license to say and 
virtually do anything they want to you.

578
00:28:08,821 --> 00:28:12,510
Because I could give you a zillion 
examples of times where I've seen anyone

579
00:28:12,511 --> 00:28:13,344
that shifts a little bit away from 
people on the left where they are 

580
00:28:16,261 --> 00:28:18,270
slandered and smeared and horrible.

581
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:22,750
They do to other people exactly what 
they say the right is doing.

582
00:28:22,990 --> 00:28:25,420
They demonize,
they objectify,

583
00:28:25,421 --> 00:28:28,210
they other eyes do use their word.
They micro,

584
00:28:28,300 --> 00:28:29,450
macro there,
there,

585
00:28:29,490 --> 00:28:30,323
there.
There are massive macro and micro and 

586
00:28:32,651 --> 00:28:35,560
nano aggression,
so they don't hesitate to be rude,

587
00:28:35,561 --> 00:28:37,360
snarky,
and there's so much meanness.

588
00:28:37,780 --> 00:28:40,030
I don't understand feminism with 
meanness.

589
00:28:40,031 --> 00:28:40,864
It was when I.
I mean I know there were some eccentric 

590
00:28:43,090 --> 00:28:45,200
angry women from the beginning of the 
second way,

591
00:28:45,201 --> 00:28:50,140
but mostly the lived experience of most 
women who were enjoying their liberation

592
00:28:50,141 --> 00:28:50,974
was happiness and joy and,
and being friends with men not going to 

593
00:28:55,361 --> 00:28:56,000
war with them.

594
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:56,833
Yeah.
So where does this strange a collusion 

595
00:28:59,241 --> 00:29:02,330
of all these people that all end up on 
the left doing this?

596
00:29:02,420 --> 00:29:04,130
You know,
I've said repeatedly on the show.

597
00:29:04,340 --> 00:29:05,173
The reason I talk about this all the 
time and the reason I tweet about the 

598
00:29:07,311 --> 00:29:10,790
regressive left and want to talk about 
this because I don't want the left to go

599
00:29:10,791 --> 00:29:14,240
over the deep end and that's why I'm 
talking about a cross section or talking

600
00:29:14,241 --> 00:29:17,840
with a cross section of people from 
literally all over the world because I'm

601
00:29:17,841 --> 00:29:19,580
afraid.
What happened to the right,

602
00:29:19,581 --> 00:29:20,750
where it went so far?
Right?

603
00:29:20,751 --> 00:29:22,580
Is,
is happening right now?

604
00:29:22,620 --> 00:29:25,470
What brings these people together,
do you think when,

605
00:29:25,471 --> 00:29:27,260
when often they shouldn't have a lot in 
common?

606
00:29:28,070 --> 00:29:28,903
Well,
I,

607
00:29:29,330 --> 00:29:30,163
I will tell you what I know best is 
among the feminist is a small group in 

608
00:29:35,061 --> 00:29:39,290
the university's gained control of the 
knowledge base.

609
00:29:39,291 --> 00:29:41,800
I mean what we think we know about and 
women.

610
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:45,550
So you're a journalist and you need to 
know something about the wage gap or you

611
00:29:45,551 --> 00:29:48,130
need to know something about women and 
in,

612
00:29:48,131 --> 00:29:49,660
in,
in education,

613
00:29:49,661 --> 00:29:50,494
you go to these people and they are what
the journalist doesn't know or the 

614
00:29:53,081 --> 00:29:53,914
politician or the interested party 
doesn't know is that they're spinning 

615
00:29:56,650 --> 00:30:00,010
and they have an ideology that drives 
their research.

616
00:30:00,220 --> 00:30:03,930
So I think a lot of people don't realize
that there's it,

617
00:30:04,180 --> 00:30:09,180
there's so much a spurious scholarship.
So they take it seriously and now it's,

618
00:30:11,210 --> 00:30:16,210
there are untruths,
exaggerations of fic,

619
00:30:17,350 --> 00:30:18,183
toys,
factoids that had been repeated so 

620
00:30:19,271 --> 00:30:20,104
often.
They're almost beyond the reach of 

621
00:30:20,771 --> 00:30:22,750
rational analysis and,
and,

622
00:30:22,770 --> 00:30:27,760
and if you question them,
you are by definition a sexist or worse.

623
00:30:28,120 --> 00:30:31,720
So they got a certain amount of power 
just through this,

624
00:30:32,130 --> 00:30:34,600
this,
this information,

625
00:30:34,601 --> 00:30:37,930
this scholarship about how in this case 
about how oppressed women were.

626
00:30:38,350 --> 00:30:40,550
So you have to sympathize and then they,
they,

627
00:30:40,660 --> 00:30:41,493
they then kind of went off the deep end 
with this psychobabble and these 

628
00:30:44,741 --> 00:30:47,720
psychodramas about.
I'm triggered and you know it.

629
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:48,593
I mean at Brown University they have a 
year or so ago and there was a story 

630
00:30:51,671 --> 00:30:52,590
about it.
You may have seen,

631
00:30:52,591 --> 00:30:57,591
I'm sure you did in the New York Times 
by Judith Shulevitz at Brown University.

632
00:30:57,941 --> 00:31:01,640
They had a debate.
So it was a feminist feminist,

633
00:31:01,680 --> 00:31:03,910
actually a libertarian feminist and 
someone else,

634
00:31:04,360 --> 00:31:05,193
another feminist debating a rape 
statistics and you would think that's 

635
00:31:10,630 --> 00:31:12,490
perfect.
What more could the students want?

636
00:31:12,491 --> 00:31:16,470
They can hear both sides and their sides
well represent no,

637
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:18,840
they didn't want the debate at all and 
they formed a,

638
00:31:19,160 --> 00:31:19,993
a safe room.
And in that safe room they were playing 

639
00:31:22,540 --> 00:31:25,570
tapes of frolicking puppy dogs.
They had bubbles,

640
00:31:25,870 --> 00:31:28,110
coloring books,
play dough.

641
00:31:28,870 --> 00:31:32,010
Maybe I made up the Plato,
I think it was there.

642
00:31:33,610 --> 00:31:37,810
So this is so infantilized and again I 
and many other feminists have my agenda,

643
00:31:37,850 --> 00:31:40,900
you look at it and say,
this is infantilization,

644
00:31:41,290 --> 00:31:42,123
this is,
this is the opposite of what feminism 

645
00:31:44,081 --> 00:31:44,914
should be.
And when I got to college we threw out 

646
00:31:46,571 --> 00:31:51,430
the dorm counselors and the guardians of
our virtue and all that.

647
00:31:51,431 --> 00:31:52,510
We wanted to be in charge.

648
00:31:52,810 --> 00:31:54,910
What went wrong?
Do you think if there was a,

649
00:31:54,930 --> 00:31:58,810
was there a moment that it actually,
that's something snapped.

650
00:31:58,900 --> 00:31:59,733
If in fact something went wrong and the 
feminist movement went from these two 

651
00:32:02,921 --> 00:32:04,540
extremes.
What do you think happened there?

652
00:32:04,560 --> 00:32:04,800
Well,

653
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:07,080
I think I know what happened.
No one listens to me.

654
00:32:07,081 --> 00:32:10,530
I wrote this article to the Aad beast 
where I pinpointed what happened.

655
00:32:10,980 --> 00:32:13,170
These were,
she'll call this,

656
00:32:13,171 --> 00:32:16,320
these,
a fainting couch.

657
00:32:16,321 --> 00:32:20,310
Feminists and purveyors of myths.
They been around for a long time.

658
00:32:20,311 --> 00:32:22,020
They'd been in gender studies is too 
bad,

659
00:32:22,050 --> 00:32:27,050
but in 2011 at little known,
uh,

660
00:32:27,910 --> 00:32:29,290
uh,
operatic,

661
00:32:29,510 --> 00:32:32,540
no other,
no a government official center that was

662
00:32:32,541 --> 00:32:35,550
going to sound conspiratorial if you 
don't know.

663
00:32:35,551 --> 00:32:36,384
But in this case it's true.
She sent out a letter to all the 

664
00:32:38,491 --> 00:32:39,770
colleges,
universities,

665
00:32:39,950 --> 00:32:42,020
her name.
She was the assistant secretary of civil

666
00:32:42,021 --> 00:32:43,430
rights,
Russell and Ali,

667
00:32:43,670 --> 00:32:48,440
and she sent out to all the colleges and
I think her intention was that they take

668
00:32:48,441 --> 00:32:49,274
more seriously that women are harassed 
on campus and there was too much sexual 

669
00:32:52,461 --> 00:32:54,350
assault,
but she went overboard.

670
00:32:54,470 --> 00:32:55,303
She's terrified the universities and 
made it seem like if they didn't 

671
00:32:57,801 --> 00:32:58,634
immediately put all like most men on 
trial and get them out of those schools 

672
00:33:02,570 --> 00:33:03,403
and believe women because she claimed 
there was this app or this epidemic of 

673
00:33:07,070 --> 00:33:12,070
sexual predation that the men at at 
campuses like Yale and swarthmore and so

674
00:33:12,591 --> 00:33:13,790
we're just praying on women.

675
00:33:14,840 --> 00:33:19,760
So she sent this letter and the schools 
now can be sued under title nine.

676
00:33:19,761 --> 00:33:23,020
This equity statute.
It's a wonderful statute.

677
00:33:23,021 --> 00:33:26,390
It was meant to be there to give women 
equal opportunities in education,

678
00:33:26,540 --> 00:33:27,373
but it's been twisted now and they've 
kind of declared martial law on men on 

679
00:33:31,010 --> 00:33:31,843
campus because of this letter was 2011 
and you look at that date and then you 

680
00:33:35,751 --> 00:33:39,500
see it brought words like trigger 
warnings and safe space.

681
00:33:39,501 --> 00:33:40,334
This whole mindset of a rather somewhat 
paranoid young women and their mentors 

682
00:33:46,101 --> 00:33:46,934
on campus it,
it gave them the power to to make a 

683
00:33:51,471 --> 00:33:54,380
federal case literally have their 
perception.

684
00:33:54,910 --> 00:33:55,743
That's so interesting because I can see 
the line now to when you were talking 

685
00:33:58,180 --> 00:34:01,480
about the cat calling,
why the slippery slope exists.

686
00:34:01,481 --> 00:34:04,300
If you were to create a law,
well then you could be in this.

687
00:34:04,750 --> 00:34:09,040
Well now once you have a law,
they already had title nine officers,

688
00:34:09,041 --> 00:34:09,874
but since 2011,
that's probably the area of greatest 

689
00:34:12,191 --> 00:34:13,024
growth on many campuses.
They have dozens and dozens of people 

690
00:34:15,880 --> 00:34:18,440
monitoring how the boys are treated in 
the girls at,

691
00:34:18,760 --> 00:34:20,050
at,
at Wesleyan,

692
00:34:20,500 --> 00:34:21,333
in these are mostly very privileged kids
and there's a lot of drinking and I'm 

693
00:34:25,091 --> 00:34:25,924
sure drunk hookups,
but they have redefined drunken hookups 

694
00:34:28,901 --> 00:34:32,370
to at TB rape of a young man against 
women.

695
00:34:32,740 --> 00:34:33,573
So of course they call them.
Then there's a rape epidemic if you're 

696
00:34:35,471 --> 00:34:37,600
going to enlarge the meaning of this 
horrible war,

697
00:34:37,601 --> 00:34:40,540
but you're going to enlarge it to 
include drunken hookups.

698
00:34:40,740 --> 00:34:42,990
Right?
So I see.

699
00:34:42,991 --> 00:34:45,960
So there's so many pieces here that,
that are related to feminism.

700
00:34:45,961 --> 00:34:48,960
And so much of this authoritarian stuff 
and the college stuff,

701
00:34:49,450 --> 00:34:50,283
the Yale thing,
which we were both tweeting about that 

702
00:34:51,540 --> 00:34:52,373
happening half ago or so with the 
professor that wrote the piece about 

703
00:34:55,820 --> 00:34:56,330
the,
you know,

704
00:34:56,330 --> 00:34:57,163
the costume Halloween costumes and if 
you see someone that's wearing saying 

705
00:35:00,421 --> 00:35:03,750
offensive,
either ignore it or use your free speech

706
00:35:03,751 --> 00:35:04,584
to engage them and why you are happy 
with it and hopefully have a 

707
00:35:07,351 --> 00:35:11,130
conversation about it.
Then that professor's a husband,

708
00:35:11,131 --> 00:35:11,964
I believe is the dean there.
He got into this argument with the 

709
00:35:14,611 --> 00:35:17,760
student and the student basically said,
and it was all caught on camera,

710
00:35:17,850 --> 00:35:21,810
basically said this is not a place of 
intellectual ism.

711
00:35:22,080 --> 00:35:25,140
This should be a whole home.
I really like.

712
00:35:25,141 --> 00:35:29,610
It takes a lot to really get me crazy.
But I thought this is dangerous now.

713
00:35:29,611 --> 00:35:30,780
What's happening,
you know.

714
00:35:30,810 --> 00:35:32,460
And I also,
I usually don't feel like a Grandpa,

715
00:35:32,490 --> 00:35:34,470
but I felt like a grandpa.
Like you kids.

716
00:35:34,710 --> 00:35:36,870
Like how stupid are you kids?
But it really,

717
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:40,500
me as now we have something systemic 
that we have to

718
00:35:41,250 --> 00:35:42,083
dangerous and here's why.
Some leftist I've seen or they're 

719
00:35:45,001 --> 00:35:46,290
embarrassed by it,
who wouldn't be,

720
00:35:46,890 --> 00:35:47,730
but they say,
oh,

721
00:35:47,731 --> 00:35:48,990
it's just kids acting out.
No,

722
00:35:48,991 --> 00:35:49,824
it's not just kids acting out.
These are kids who have been fed a lot 

723
00:35:53,431 --> 00:35:54,264
of bad,
crazy information in their ethnic 

724
00:35:57,151 --> 00:36:00,630
studies or gender studies where it's 
highly politicized scholarship.

725
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:03,780
They've had it and they may,
if they went to elite high schools,

726
00:36:03,781 --> 00:36:04,614
they probably had it since 10th grade.
They've been reading these conspiracy 

727
00:36:09,691 --> 00:36:10,524
theories about how bad the United States
or a western culture and particularly 

728
00:36:14,671 --> 00:36:15,504
the men,
it's patriarchal male had Gemini so 

729
00:36:17,791 --> 00:36:20,310
forth and uh,
they believe it and,

730
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:23,910
and they do not have much knowledge of 
history.

731
00:36:24,270 --> 00:36:25,103
So if they are doing things that people 
that know history remind you of the 

732
00:36:30,031 --> 00:36:30,864
mccarthy era or even the Salem witch 
trials just in terms of hysteria and 

733
00:36:36,121 --> 00:36:38,360
contagions of hysteria.
Um,

734
00:36:38,580 --> 00:36:40,010
they're not aware of it.
I mean,

735
00:36:40,150 --> 00:36:42,240
and what this is,
this doesn't happen often,

736
00:36:42,241 --> 00:36:44,760
but there was one young woman that,
and this is all over,

737
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:46,650
not all over,
but you can find it on the Internet.

738
00:36:46,651 --> 00:36:48,830
She burned my book.
She gleefully,

739
00:36:48,860 --> 00:36:51,510
young woman took the organs boys and 
burned it and I just,

740
00:36:51,810 --> 00:36:53,610
I just,
as a teacher and a mother,

741
00:36:53,611 --> 00:36:58,470
I just thought Bra burning a book,
have a good history,

742
00:36:58,860 --> 00:36:59,693
you know,

743
00:37:00,670 --> 00:37:02,420
now I assume that she tweeted it at you.

744
00:37:03,020 --> 00:37:04,210
Well,
it was a,

745
00:37:04,390 --> 00:37:06,520
it was on tumbler and someone sent it to
me.

746
00:37:08,790 --> 00:37:09,623
So basically they're,
they're creating an atmosphere where 

747
00:37:12,061 --> 00:37:13,380
almost everything.
I mean,

748
00:37:13,381 --> 00:37:14,214
it really feels 19,
84 or wellbeing reverse everything is 

749
00:37:17,521 --> 00:37:22,440
this sort of doublespeak and reverse of 
how we're supposed to have debate,

750
00:37:22,470 --> 00:37:22,891
right?
I mean,

751
00:37:22,891 --> 00:37:25,860
if you can't have an intellectual debate
in college,

752
00:37:25,861 --> 00:37:27,960
well how are you going to get out to the
real world and do it

753
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:29,313
right?
And the Supreme Court has ruled many 

754
00:37:30,611 --> 00:37:35,080
times that freedom of speech is most 
important on the college campus.

755
00:37:35,110 --> 00:37:40,110
It has refused to a Jew to sanction 
speech codes and the courts have refused

756
00:37:41,621 --> 00:37:42,870
to do this.
Uh,

757
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:45,670
but schools have them anyway.
And,

758
00:37:45,730 --> 00:37:46,710
um,
it,

759
00:37:46,720 --> 00:37:47,240
it,
it,

760
00:37:47,240 --> 00:37:48,073
if our universities become places where 
you have to be hyper protective of 

761
00:37:52,271 --> 00:37:53,920
students,
protect them from ideas,

762
00:37:53,921 --> 00:37:58,510
and your goal is to achieve massive 
amount of comfort and safety.

763
00:37:58,690 --> 00:38:01,510
You have undermined the purpose of your 
being.

764
00:38:01,810 --> 00:38:04,570
You exist at the universities don't 
exist for that purpose.

765
00:38:04,720 --> 00:38:06,380
Going back to the time of,
of,

766
00:38:06,390 --> 00:38:08,140
of the,
of socrates.

767
00:38:08,650 --> 00:38:13,650
The academy was about debate and,
and counterargument and,

768
00:38:14,150 --> 00:38:15,900
and being able to reason.
And,

769
00:38:16,360 --> 00:38:17,460
and uh,

770
00:38:18,440 --> 00:38:20,410
I think that's why people are responding
to us.

771
00:38:20,411 --> 00:38:22,480
Right?
Because we're trying to bring that back.

772
00:38:22,481 --> 00:38:25,000
What else do you think we can do?
Because,

773
00:38:25,120 --> 00:38:25,771
you know,
I,

774
00:38:25,771 --> 00:38:28,240
I see this stuff and I talk about it all
the time,

775
00:38:28,540 --> 00:38:29,940
but every now and again I got,
I mean,

776
00:38:29,980 --> 00:38:32,920
100 percent of the.
I do feel a little guilty ever.

777
00:38:33,210 --> 00:38:35,320
It's rare,
but I do once a while,

778
00:38:35,321 --> 00:38:35,770
like,
you know,

779
00:38:35,770 --> 00:38:38,260
in something like the,
what happened at University of Missouri.

780
00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:40,750
I empathize with these kids if they 
feel,

781
00:38:40,751 --> 00:38:41,680
you know,
if they were racist,

782
00:38:41,681 --> 00:38:45,250
things happening inside the whole.
That thing sounds a little unclear as to

783
00:38:45,251 --> 00:38:46,084
what exactly was going on in the poop 
swastikas and somebody said the n word 

784
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:51,400
and all this,
but I have no doubt that there is racism

785
00:38:51,401 --> 00:38:53,560
on the campus and there's racism in 
Missouri and in the country.

786
00:38:53,561 --> 00:38:57,160
I've moved out.
So sometimes I do feel a little.

787
00:38:57,670 --> 00:38:59,380
Guilty isn't the right word,
but a little.

788
00:38:59,990 --> 00:39:01,560
No,
I understand exactly what you're saying.

789
00:39:01,610 --> 00:39:02,443
Take it then.
I have never really gone on about the 

790
00:39:05,630 --> 00:39:07,580
race issues the way I do with the gender
issues.

791
00:39:07,670 --> 00:39:11,030
I think they're very different.
There's a particular history,

792
00:39:11,480 --> 00:39:16,100
a very specific history with African 
Americans in the United States and,

793
00:39:16,290 --> 00:39:17,123
and,
and I don't like to see the women's 

794
00:39:18,171 --> 00:39:22,250
movement pretending that they're women 
have been oppressed in the same way.

795
00:39:22,251 --> 00:39:24,530
That is just not true.
Depends on which women.

796
00:39:24,920 --> 00:39:27,980
And if you were an upper middle class 
white woman,

797
00:39:28,060 --> 00:39:28,893
you have had a very different history.
And this was supposedly the great 

798
00:39:32,330 --> 00:39:35,720
insight of intersectional 
intersectionality,

799
00:39:35,721 --> 00:39:39,230
but they didn't seem to apply it very 
consistently.

800
00:39:39,380 --> 00:39:40,213
And certain groups,
like most men seem to be written out of 

801
00:39:42,651 --> 00:39:43,640
it.
So,

802
00:39:43,641 --> 00:39:45,050
um,
it's just not,

803
00:39:45,230 --> 00:39:48,530
it's not a consistent body of work.
They need to bring in more critics,

804
00:39:48,531 --> 00:39:52,460
they need to,
to hear from dissidents and um,

805
00:39:53,070 --> 00:39:54,470
if they think,
well,

806
00:39:55,040 --> 00:39:55,873
ours is a compassionate movement and 
they are going after people's jobs and 

807
00:40:00,171 --> 00:40:01,130
as I said,
there are these,

808
00:40:01,160 --> 00:40:05,080
these sort of twitter mobs that want to 
destroy people's reputation.

809
00:40:05,270 --> 00:40:06,103
Well,
what did you make of that professor at 

810
00:40:06,911 --> 00:40:07,744
Missouri?
The woman who was standing there 

811
00:40:08,890 --> 00:40:11,870
screaming at the reporter who was,
you know,

812
00:40:11,930 --> 00:40:12,763
she was saying,
we need some muscle around here to get 

813
00:40:13,781 --> 00:40:14,760
the reporter editor

814
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:15,713
was a thug.
It was thuggish and many of the little 

815
00:40:19,621 --> 00:40:21,940
scenes I've seen on the campuses,
uh,

816
00:40:22,310 --> 00:40:23,700
uh,
reminiscent of a,

817
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:27,900
like these struggles sessions they had 
in the cultural revolution in China.

818
00:40:27,901 --> 00:40:30,100
And those were run by students.
I mean it.

819
00:40:30,210 --> 00:40:30,961
People say,
well,

820
00:40:30,961 --> 00:40:31,794
you wouldn't compare them.
Those people we know we're throwing 

821
00:40:32,911 --> 00:40:35,180
people out of windows.
I agree that I don't,

822
00:40:35,370 --> 00:40:37,590
they're not comparable in that way.
For one thing,

823
00:40:37,591 --> 00:40:40,170
these kids on our campus don't have that
kind of power,

824
00:40:40,171 --> 00:40:43,680
thank God.
But some that I see such as,

825
00:40:43,870 --> 00:40:47,340
they seem so intoxicated with hatred and
self righteousness,

826
00:40:48,210 --> 00:40:49,980
I don't know what they would do if they 
had power,

827
00:40:50,310 --> 00:40:52,350
real power.
They have power to hurt people,

828
00:40:52,351 --> 00:40:54,210
you know,
their jobs and reputations.

829
00:40:54,450 --> 00:40:56,220
But that's already awful.
Look,

830
00:40:56,240 --> 00:40:57,073
I mean,
it's awful what's happening to so many 

831
00:40:58,081 --> 00:41:00,840
young men and I have no apologies for 
criminals.

832
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:03,730
They're criminals on campus and taking 
advantages of,

833
00:41:04,080 --> 00:41:05,550
of girls.
That's awful.

834
00:41:05,850 --> 00:41:10,850
But what is more often the case with so 
many that we've read about,

835
00:41:10,920 --> 00:41:12,690
it's young men that,
that,

836
00:41:12,810 --> 00:41:15,680
you know,
it's like a year later the girl takes a,

837
00:41:16,140 --> 00:41:20,310
the young woman takes a women's studies 
class and rethinks this bad hookup.

838
00:41:20,550 --> 00:41:21,383
And then he's brought up on charges,
sometimes not even told what the 

839
00:41:24,180 --> 00:41:27,420
specifics of the charge are.
We've had too many of those.

840
00:41:27,930 --> 00:41:28,763
And um,
so that's what worries me is these 

841
00:41:30,631 --> 00:41:34,930
people get carried away and these gender
studies and other things and then they,

842
00:41:35,270 --> 00:41:37,820
they have no regard or maybe no 
knowledge of,

843
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:41,070
of the first amendment of due process 
of,

844
00:41:41,110 --> 00:41:41,943
of the,
the history of the battle that was 

845
00:41:43,791 --> 00:41:45,470
fought for freedom of speech.
Now,

846
00:41:45,471 --> 00:41:46,304
of course it will be turned on them.
So you're already seeing now feminists 

847
00:41:48,711 --> 00:41:49,544
are getting in trouble.
I think there was a professor that was 

848
00:41:51,141 --> 00:41:53,810
hired.
It was fired for using the f word.

849
00:41:53,860 --> 00:41:55,150
Yeah.
Well now you can see that.

850
00:41:55,200 --> 00:41:57,340
I mean it's happening right now.
It's turning on them right now.

851
00:41:57,341 --> 00:41:59,580
You can see the left eating itself.
Right?

852
00:41:59,770 --> 00:42:02,740
And if someone on the left,
I probably shouldn't be taking that much

853
00:42:02,741 --> 00:42:05,290
joy in it,
but because it's been so warped,

854
00:42:05,291 --> 00:42:06,880
I actually am.
I want,

855
00:42:07,090 --> 00:42:08,050
you know,
as we've been calling them,

856
00:42:08,051 --> 00:42:08,884
the regressives I want them to.
I want them to go the way of the 

857
00:42:10,841 --> 00:42:11,980
dinosaur.
Enough of this,

858
00:42:12,270 --> 00:42:15,710
enough of this I know.
And we bring back it just a,

859
00:42:16,480 --> 00:42:19,800
an environment of openness and with 
jokes.

860
00:42:19,880 --> 00:42:21,150
Yeah,
there shelby jokes.

861
00:42:21,190 --> 00:42:21,590
I was,
was it?

862
00:42:21,590 --> 00:42:22,740
Let's move away from some of the serious
stuff,

863
00:42:22,741 --> 00:42:25,140
but now I'm going to bring up Gamergate.
So I don't know which way is this.

864
00:42:25,141 --> 00:42:28,170
Serious or joking will find that tragic 
comedy.

865
00:42:28,171 --> 00:42:29,004
Okay.
So actually I remember very much the 

866
00:42:30,961 --> 00:42:31,794
first time I heard you was about a year 
ago or so when Gamergate was just 

867
00:42:34,861 --> 00:42:37,470
starting to percolate up and I tweeted 
out,

868
00:42:37,471 --> 00:42:39,510
I said I want to do something about 
Gamergate,

869
00:42:39,720 --> 00:42:40,553
can you point me in the right direction 
because I really could not get ahold of 

870
00:42:43,351 --> 00:42:45,330
it,
which it seems like no one still can get

871
00:42:45,331 --> 00:42:46,164
a hold of,
but your name came up and Milo 

872
00:42:48,630 --> 00:42:49,463
Yiannopoulos and Adam Baldwin and a 
couple of other people popped up and I 

873
00:42:50,881 --> 00:42:51,714
was looking around and I did one video 
on it and I basically said I tried to 

874
00:42:56,371 --> 00:42:57,630
lay it out,
but I basically said I don't know what's

875
00:42:57,631 --> 00:42:58,464
going on here right now.
Since then I've had my avalon and I 

876
00:43:00,571 --> 00:43:02,250
thought he did a pretty good 
explanation.

877
00:43:02,460 --> 00:43:03,293
You've become sort of a,
I guess like a heroine of the Gamergate 

878
00:43:07,140 --> 00:43:08,430
movement,
um,

879
00:43:08,460 --> 00:43:10,290
for a lot of the reasons you're 
discussing here.

880
00:43:10,291 --> 00:43:12,330
So if you were going to explain it in 
like two minutes,

881
00:43:12,331 --> 00:43:16,950
how would you explain the,
the thing that is Gamergate?

882
00:43:17,860 --> 00:43:19,090
Well,
just the first thing to know.

883
00:43:19,091 --> 00:43:19,924
I am not a Gamer and in fact I've looked
at some of the games that are con and 

884
00:43:22,780 --> 00:43:23,240
they,
they,

885
00:43:23,240 --> 00:43:24,073
and you know,
there's too much violence and mayhem 

886
00:43:26,210 --> 00:43:26,990
mend.
It's,

887
00:43:26,990 --> 00:43:27,823
I mean,
but I also don't like shows like 

888
00:43:29,200 --> 00:43:31,810
breaking bad or I can't watch them too 
much violence.

889
00:43:31,880 --> 00:43:34,140
So you believe they should exist if 
people sort of,

890
00:43:34,320 --> 00:43:34,530
not

891
00:43:34,530 --> 00:43:36,390
my taste,
I do prefer,

892
00:43:36,391 --> 00:43:38,170
you know,
pride and prejudice or you know,

893
00:43:38,210 --> 00:43:39,540
the latest pbs,
uh,

894
00:43:40,340 --> 00:43:42,060
um,
Downton Abbey,

895
00:43:42,061 --> 00:43:44,520
that sort of thing.
But it's not.

896
00:43:44,550 --> 00:43:45,383
I don't impose that on everyone.
And I recognized there can be great 

897
00:43:47,851 --> 00:43:48,684
movies.
Alfred Hitchcock was a great director 

898
00:43:50,521 --> 00:43:52,410
but I will never see psycho.
I'm too afraid.

899
00:43:52,411 --> 00:43:53,670
It's not my,
I can't,

900
00:43:53,671 --> 00:43:56,640
I don't enjoy that experience of being 
terrified in the theater,

901
00:43:56,760 --> 00:43:59,700
but people do it and it's theirs.
It's harmless.

902
00:43:59,990 --> 00:44:04,830
And so when the video game controversy 
erupted,

903
00:44:05,130 --> 00:44:06,540
I,
I took a,

904
00:44:06,690 --> 00:44:07,523
I took a measure of it.
I saw some familiar players because I'd 

905
00:44:10,260 --> 00:44:13,890
been in some of these same battles.
And I saw that,

906
00:44:13,891 --> 00:44:17,220
um,
some of the feminist critics were cherry

907
00:44:17,221 --> 00:44:20,880
picking.
They were misrepresenting and uh,

908
00:44:21,120 --> 00:44:21,810
and that,
uh,

909
00:44:21,810 --> 00:44:26,810
the gay gate was being judged by.
There are some extreme people associated

910
00:44:27,031 --> 00:44:29,310
with it at the periphery,
but the CD,

911
00:44:29,880 --> 00:44:31,950
but like every,
what I mean,

912
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:32,833
the occupy Wall Street,
there were crazy people on the 

913
00:44:35,071 --> 00:44:35,910
periphery.
Sure.

914
00:44:36,090 --> 00:44:36,923
And,
and black lives matter if you go to the 

915
00:44:38,311 --> 00:44:39,210
periphery,
but you,

916
00:44:39,230 --> 00:44:41,760
what you should do is go to the center 
and what are they saying?

917
00:44:41,761 --> 00:44:44,700
That's what I tried to do is go in and 
see what they were saying.

918
00:44:45,180 --> 00:44:46,350
And uh,
these,

919
00:44:46,560 --> 00:44:47,393
these critics.
First you had critics who said video 

920
00:44:49,231 --> 00:44:52,050
games are causing mayhem.
They create violence.

921
00:44:52,200 --> 00:44:56,130
No one has been able to show that.
And psychologists are already just tired

922
00:44:56,131 --> 00:44:56,964
of it.
They're not,

923
00:44:57,180 --> 00:44:58,770
forget it,
you're not theirs.

924
00:44:58,800 --> 00:45:01,050
It's just going in a circle.
No one has been able to show that.

925
00:45:01,080 --> 00:45:01,741
Yeah,
it hasn't.

926
00:45:01,741 --> 00:45:02,574
There been some studies that have proven
it actually does the reverse because 

927
00:45:04,321 --> 00:45:05,154
people,
you get some of their aggression out 

928
00:45:07,050 --> 00:45:08,610
instead of actually shooting similar.

929
00:45:09,390 --> 00:45:10,870
And it takes a lot.
I mean,

930
00:45:11,370 --> 00:45:13,450
no one knows what creates a,
you know,

931
00:45:13,451 --> 00:45:14,940
a sociopath,
a criminal,

932
00:45:14,941 --> 00:45:17,940
but it's probably not video games.
But,

933
00:45:18,050 --> 00:45:20,610
and in previous generations they thought
it was comic books.

934
00:45:20,611 --> 00:45:24,960
We had a corrupting influence on the 
morals of the young or it was television

935
00:45:24,961 --> 00:45:27,990
and any new medium goes through this and
games seem to be there.

936
00:45:28,470 --> 00:45:32,880
And then there was a feminist critics 
and they were saying that it was causing

937
00:45:32,881 --> 00:45:33,900
the,
well,

938
00:45:33,901 --> 00:45:34,734
they were saying two things,
but the games themselves are sexist and 

939
00:45:36,781 --> 00:45:41,300
they,
they create a attitudes of sexism.

940
00:45:41,670 --> 00:45:44,100
And I,
I just do not see evidence of that.

941
00:45:44,250 --> 00:45:48,150
I did see that some of them had sexy 
women and um,

942
00:45:48,420 --> 00:45:51,180
but if the players like it and many of 
them,

943
00:45:51,240 --> 00:45:52,073
you know,
men are known to like images of sexy 

944
00:45:54,451 --> 00:45:55,284
women.
I just didn't understand why we were 

945
00:45:55,951 --> 00:45:56,940
demonizing that.

946
00:45:57,510 --> 00:45:59,220
And people say,
well,

947
00:45:59,250 --> 00:46:00,083
feminists will say that,
that the male gaze looking at women's 

948
00:46:03,091 --> 00:46:06,480
bodies objectifying which feminist I was
a part of,

949
00:46:06,481 --> 00:46:11,481
a group of feminists or libertarian 
feminists who it was live and let live.

950
00:46:11,761 --> 00:46:12,594
I mean,
I,

951
00:46:13,140 --> 00:46:13,973
I'm not against people.
There was a whole group of feminists 

952
00:46:16,201 --> 00:46:17,820
that were against having,
you know,

953
00:46:18,120 --> 00:46:18,953
women posing in playboy or,
or the sports illustrated swimsuit 

954
00:46:24,001 --> 00:46:24,870
issue.
And all of that,

955
00:46:24,871 --> 00:46:27,390
Catherine Mackinnon,
Andrea Dworkin,

956
00:46:27,391 --> 00:46:28,224
but there was a whole group of us that 
were opposed and I think we won the 

957
00:46:30,091 --> 00:46:30,924
argument,
but apparently they won the assistant 

958
00:46:33,211 --> 00:46:35,670
professorships.
They've been there ever since.

959
00:46:36,140 --> 00:46:37,590
It's teaching these.

960
00:46:37,640 --> 00:46:39,460
That's all they might've won

961
00:46:40,010 --> 00:46:40,843
if they teach.
We won all the battles when they were 

962
00:46:42,751 --> 00:46:45,300
the first so called culture war.
We won the arguments.

963
00:46:45,301 --> 00:46:47,310
We had the New York Times on our side.
We had new,

964
00:46:47,311 --> 00:46:51,570
you know,
the media and now they've been.

965
00:46:51,840 --> 00:46:53,360
They've been laboring away,
you know,

966
00:46:53,790 --> 00:46:56,880
with their theories and they know 
relentless and now they have the backing

967
00:46:56,881 --> 00:46:57,714
of the Department of Education because 
through so in the educational system 

968
00:47:00,451 --> 00:47:02,610
they can make a federal case of 
everything.

969
00:47:03,030 --> 00:47:03,863
So it's difficult.
I think in the end we will prevail 

970
00:47:05,971 --> 00:47:10,971
because I have great faith in just human
ability to see through nonsense.

971
00:47:12,330 --> 00:47:14,310
Eventually it has to fall.

972
00:47:14,520 --> 00:47:15,353
Right.
So my question there was what is 

973
00:47:16,471 --> 00:47:17,304
Gamergate?
And I think your answer because your 

974
00:47:19,381 --> 00:47:20,214
answer.
I had almost nothing to do with 

975
00:47:20,581 --> 00:47:22,020
Gamergate.
I think it was the right answer,

976
00:47:22,021 --> 00:47:22,854
right?
Because that seems to be the confusion 

977
00:47:24,240 --> 00:47:25,073
about what is Gamergate?
Nobody seems to really understand what 

978
00:47:28,141 --> 00:47:28,974
it is.
I think at this point it's morphed into 

979
00:47:30,371 --> 00:47:30,950
so many details,

980
00:47:30,950 --> 00:47:34,400
so many different things,
but at the core it was a group of Gamers

981
00:47:34,401 --> 00:47:36,500
who were.
There were issues.

982
00:47:36,501 --> 00:47:37,870
I don't understand.
It's not a Gamer.

983
00:47:37,920 --> 00:47:41,550
They were irritated by some cronyism in 
the race.

984
00:47:42,190 --> 00:47:44,680
The magazines were being paid off by the
manufacturer.

985
00:47:44,710 --> 00:47:45,543
No.
All that was going on and that that 

986
00:47:46,301 --> 00:47:46,810
happened.
We had,

987
00:47:46,810 --> 00:47:49,180
we saw that in radio when it was a 
younger medium,

988
00:47:49,181 --> 00:47:51,610
there was payola and all it has to be 
sorted out.

989
00:47:51,611 --> 00:47:54,230
I think gaming had to go through that 
and maybe it still has to go,

990
00:47:54,730 --> 00:47:56,620
but it's,
it's improved since Gamergate,

991
00:47:56,650 --> 00:48:00,490
that's for sure.
But then they also would find themselves

992
00:48:00,491 --> 00:48:01,091
in,
you know,

993
00:48:01,091 --> 00:48:06,091
getting attacked by game critics or 
games evaluated because they objectified

994
00:48:06,641 --> 00:48:09,430
women or something and,
and they were just thinking,

995
00:48:09,460 --> 00:48:11,970
we just want to play our games.
We don't really.

996
00:48:12,120 --> 00:48:13,600
Yeah.
So whatever.

997
00:48:13,601 --> 00:48:14,434
And then they had these critiques of the
Games that were so cherry picked and 

998
00:48:18,971 --> 00:48:19,804
these gamers,
they know their games don't mess with 

999
00:48:22,421 --> 00:48:23,254
that and they know the games and then so
they were is of course Anita Sarkeesian 

1000
00:48:28,120 --> 00:48:30,210
and her videos.
It was infuriating to.

1001
00:48:30,250 --> 00:48:31,083
And these are some young guys,
mainland some girls and they see their 

1002
00:48:34,211 --> 00:48:37,170
games being misrepresented or she'll 
pick a scene out,

1003
00:48:37,210 --> 00:48:40,240
make it look like one thing and was 
totally different or take a video.

1004
00:48:40,241 --> 00:48:41,074
No one ever watched that had you know,
a following of five and act as though 

1005
00:48:45,491 --> 00:48:48,430
it's typical of the game.
So they knew it was cheating.

1006
00:48:48,431 --> 00:48:49,264
They knew and they got really mad.
Now what I liked about many of them is 

1007
00:48:52,901 --> 00:48:54,760
they,
they fought back with arguments,

1008
00:48:54,770 --> 00:48:56,260
they made videos,
they were,

1009
00:48:56,290 --> 00:48:57,123
it was,
it was this explosion of can we get 

1010
00:48:58,811 --> 00:48:59,644
acacia now?
There were crazy opportunists at the 

1011
00:49:02,591 --> 00:49:04,510
edges or maybe they weren't even part of
Gamergate.

1012
00:49:04,540 --> 00:49:09,540
Maybe no one knows who sent threats and 
people on both sides of the controversy.

1013
00:49:10,271 --> 00:49:10,870
Get them.

1014
00:49:10,870 --> 00:49:11,703
Yeah.
So that's the interesting part that 

1015
00:49:13,090 --> 00:49:16,300
there was this group of.
It's younger people playing video games.

1016
00:49:16,540 --> 00:49:18,640
They felt that the system that they,
you know,

1017
00:49:18,641 --> 00:49:20,740
they love these games,
they felt that the man,

1018
00:49:20,741 --> 00:49:22,360
you know,
the video game manufacturers,

1019
00:49:22,630 --> 00:49:25,780
they're buying the reviews and all that 
and it starts with that,

1020
00:49:26,050 --> 00:49:26,883
but I think you just hit it that it 
became this thing where suddenly this 

1021
00:49:28,841 --> 00:49:31,600
group of people who have nothing in 
common,

1022
00:49:31,750 --> 00:49:32,583
we,
they don't know what each other's skin 

1023
00:49:33,431 --> 00:49:36,280
color is or sexuality is or any of this 
stuff is,

1024
00:49:36,670 --> 00:49:37,503
but they all found this common thing 
related to authoritarianism and they 

1025
00:49:41,141 --> 00:49:43,270
fought it and that's why I was 
fascinated

1026
00:49:43,290 --> 00:49:45,390
and they fought and they fought and 
they,

1027
00:49:45,450 --> 00:49:46,440
they,
you know,

1028
00:49:46,441 --> 00:49:48,030
it just,
it's,

1029
00:49:48,060 --> 00:49:49,470
it may erupt again.
It goes,

1030
00:49:49,500 --> 00:49:50,400
it comes and goes.
But,

1031
00:49:50,950 --> 00:49:54,450
uh,
there was comradery and to two times,

1032
00:49:54,451 --> 00:49:57,040
maybe two times we've had these gamer 
gate hookups where,

1033
00:49:57,090 --> 00:49:58,920
because you only know each,
it's just a Hashtag.

1034
00:49:58,921 --> 00:50:00,720
It's not an organization.
And uh,

1035
00:50:00,721 --> 00:50:03,060
and in both DC and in,
um,

1036
00:50:03,570 --> 00:50:07,500
in London we had a meetup and I met the 
gamers that and they weren't there.

1037
00:50:07,560 --> 00:50:11,580
You can't be a more delightful,
friendly group of people.

1038
00:50:11,800 --> 00:50:12,633
So that,
should that be the piece that gives you 

1039
00:50:13,901 --> 00:50:15,820
the hope that you were alluding to a 
second ago,

1040
00:50:16,030 --> 00:50:20,260
that there was this group of younger 
people that said we're not going to take

1041
00:50:20,261 --> 00:50:22,030
this bullshit and if they're not going 
to take it,

1042
00:50:22,170 --> 00:50:23,070
they were,
they were,

1043
00:50:23,240 --> 00:50:24,073
you know,
they were,

1044
00:50:24,260 --> 00:50:28,100
it was a majority guys,
but lots of fantastic young women who,

1045
00:50:28,101 --> 00:50:31,670
and again these are hardcore Gamers,
I dunno,

1046
00:50:31,730 --> 00:50:34,580
maybe 70 or 80 percent male,
but there's some fun.

1047
00:50:34,660 --> 00:50:35,493
The girls that are,
they're fantastic and they're part of 

1048
00:50:37,101 --> 00:50:39,140
that group.
So they even whatever they were,

1049
00:50:39,141 --> 00:50:41,750
they could.
There are gay women and,

1050
00:50:41,780 --> 00:50:44,450
and,
and every race I mean is,

1051
00:50:44,470 --> 00:50:49,470
it is represented and you realize 
gamergate was a consumer uprising really

1052
00:50:50,270 --> 00:50:54,140
from across the world across racial and 
class and gender lines.

1053
00:50:54,650 --> 00:50:57,410
And it was just defending a hobby they 
love.

1054
00:50:57,450 --> 00:50:58,820
Right?
So that's sort of what it is,

1055
00:50:58,821 --> 00:50:59,654
is that,
that's why the regressive left really 

1056
00:51:00,961 --> 00:51:03,090
hated it,
hated it.

1057
00:51:03,300 --> 00:51:06,570
And they wanted to get the idea that 
there would be a rebellion.

1058
00:51:06,900 --> 00:51:09,690
How dare you,
you do not talk back to big sister,

1059
00:51:10,290 --> 00:51:11,123
which is so fascinating because.
Because it was a cross section of 

1060
00:51:13,591 --> 00:51:14,424
people,
they couldn't figure out who to guilt 

1061
00:51:15,991 --> 00:51:20,160
into hating who more and that I think 
transcends so many things that we see on

1062
00:51:20,161 --> 00:51:23,310
college campuses and we see in our 
public discourse and free speech and all

1063
00:51:23,311 --> 00:51:25,320
that.
For you personally,

1064
00:51:25,321 --> 00:51:26,760
how does it feel as you just said,
you don't.

1065
00:51:27,090 --> 00:51:30,150
You were never a Gamer,
but yet you're based mom.

1066
00:51:30,151 --> 00:51:33,270
For these people.
How does it feel to be part of something

1067
00:51:33,271 --> 00:51:35,460
that you actually,
unlike feminism,

1068
00:51:35,461 --> 00:51:37,860
where you had a vested interest as a 
woman,

1069
00:51:37,861 --> 00:51:41,970
let's say now you're part of something 
that you want to say.

1070
00:51:41,971 --> 00:51:44,100
You don't care about it because you care
about these people obviously,

1071
00:51:44,280 --> 00:51:45,330
but as you said,
you're not a Gamer,

1072
00:51:45,331 --> 00:51:47,100
but you're a leader in this thing.

1073
00:51:48,290 --> 00:51:52,160
It's happened before I came to the 
defensive wrestlers because they were.

1074
00:51:52,700 --> 00:51:53,533
Our sport has been demolished by it.
Completely unnecessary interpretations 

1075
00:51:58,851 --> 00:51:59,684
of this title Nine Equity Law.
And so I made friends with a lot of 

1076
00:52:02,631 --> 00:52:05,690
wrestlers.
I've never wrestled and I've never even.

1077
00:52:05,720 --> 00:52:06,553
I've never even seen it,
I don't think except accidentally 

1078
00:52:08,750 --> 00:52:09,760
channel surfing.
Right?

1079
00:52:10,020 --> 00:52:11,630
Um,
but I love these.

1080
00:52:11,690 --> 00:52:13,820
These are just great guys and they,
they were,

1081
00:52:13,821 --> 00:52:15,310
and they couldn't,
you know,

1082
00:52:15,410 --> 00:52:19,190
they,
they didn't have a voice in this debate.

1083
00:52:19,460 --> 00:52:20,750
And these,
you know,

1084
00:52:21,260 --> 00:52:22,093
gender experts speak for the,
as if they're speaking for all women or 

1085
00:52:27,260 --> 00:52:29,840
all of the left or something.
They speak for themselves.

1086
00:52:29,960 --> 00:52:32,540
People should know that.
So how did it feel?

1087
00:52:32,600 --> 00:52:33,380
Uh,
it,

1088
00:52:33,380 --> 00:52:34,340
it's fine.
It's,

1089
00:52:34,370 --> 00:52:35,203
I mean,
because just because everyone seems 

1090
00:52:35,961 --> 00:52:37,160
great and I,
I just,

1091
00:52:37,250 --> 00:52:38,720
I mean,
as I said I haven't,

1092
00:52:39,500 --> 00:52:42,680
I can't think of a group of people that 
were just more diverse,

1093
00:52:42,710 --> 00:52:46,250
more welcoming,
good sense of humor and creative.

1094
00:52:46,280 --> 00:52:47,210
I think,
you know,

1095
00:52:47,211 --> 00:52:50,720
if I were to,
based on my knowledge of gamers over the

1096
00:52:50,720 --> 00:52:54,590
last year or so,
it's someone's like obsessive gaming.

1097
00:52:54,650 --> 00:52:57,920
It's predictive of being an artist or an
engineer.

1098
00:52:57,921 --> 00:52:58,940
They're smart too.

1099
00:52:59,150 --> 00:52:59,983
It's hard to play these games.
I mean we've got the army and the navy 

1100
00:53:02,991 --> 00:53:05,790
now playing video games to learn how to 
actually do things.

1101
00:53:05,830 --> 00:53:07,130
So it's not that these,
you know,

1102
00:53:07,131 --> 00:53:08,970
I was used to,
I was running around is Mary,

1103
00:53:08,971 --> 00:53:10,160
oh,
eat mushrooms.

1104
00:53:11,190 --> 00:53:12,650
That did for me,
but nice.

1105
00:53:12,790 --> 00:53:14,220
So mushrooms in college.
But uh,

1106
00:53:14,720 --> 00:53:18,350
what about online harassment because 
that is also a piece of this and it also

1107
00:53:18,351 --> 00:53:20,650
fits the feminism thing.
Um,

1108
00:53:21,230 --> 00:53:24,830
how much of it is honestly,
how much of it is real?

1109
00:53:24,831 --> 00:53:25,664
There's obviously plenty of it's real 
and we can look on any youtube comments 

1110
00:53:27,901 --> 00:53:28,734
section and then there's everybody 
harassing everybody for every other 

1111
00:53:31,800 --> 00:53:36,780
reason that it's endless.
How much concern should we actually have

1112
00:53:36,781 --> 00:53:37,614
for this?
Or is it something that is not that 

1113
00:53:39,181 --> 00:53:41,170
important because it's just words

1114
00:53:41,350 --> 00:53:43,810
digital.
We should have concern for a,

1115
00:53:44,670 --> 00:53:47,010
just a,
a certain category of harassment.

1116
00:53:47,310 --> 00:53:49,680
First of all,
we have to make distinctions.

1117
00:53:50,040 --> 00:53:50,873
If you're online and you know,
there are different people can disagree 

1118
00:53:54,061 --> 00:53:56,730
with you that could upset you but you 
know,

1119
00:53:57,000 --> 00:54:00,270
live with it and people could insult 
you.

1120
00:54:00,600 --> 00:54:02,310
That's life,
just unfollow them.

1121
00:54:02,910 --> 00:54:06,610
Then people can be obscene and you know,
like,

1122
00:54:06,680 --> 00:54:07,513
and it's probably more upsetting to a 
woman than a man that kind of like 

1123
00:54:09,570 --> 00:54:14,040
sexual and then they can issue like 
really scary threats right now obviously

1124
00:54:14,041 --> 00:54:16,830
with the really scary threats and 
probably the obscenity.

1125
00:54:17,310 --> 00:54:19,160
Uh,
well let's start with the threats there.

1126
00:54:19,220 --> 00:54:23,340
You have to,
we have to do something about that and I

1127
00:54:23,341 --> 00:54:25,550
think we are.
I mean I think they get reported and,

1128
00:54:26,400 --> 00:54:27,930
and when,
if they're credible,

1129
00:54:27,960 --> 00:54:30,460
but the thing is with Gabria gate and 
like,

1130
00:54:30,510 --> 00:54:34,360
has anybody been hurt?
Is there any evidence of itch?

1131
00:54:34,390 --> 00:54:37,680
It's just all internet nonsense.
I mean these,

1132
00:54:37,950 --> 00:54:42,150
there are these threatening males and 
making mean where are they?

1133
00:54:42,180 --> 00:54:44,400
I mean were who has been hurt.
Exactly.

1134
00:54:44,401 --> 00:54:46,920
I mean the worst thing I,
one of the worst things I read about was

1135
00:54:47,520 --> 00:54:49,860
milo getting terrible things in the 
mail,

1136
00:54:49,940 --> 00:54:51,150
right?
Milo Yiannopoulos,

1137
00:54:52,500 --> 00:54:54,980
bomb threats called we have something 
that he did.

1138
00:54:55,080 --> 00:54:55,913
Yes.
When we

1139
00:54:55,920 --> 00:55:00,050
did our Gamer meetup where I met the 
gamers in Washington DC,

1140
00:55:01,220 --> 00:55:03,560
a critic of Gamergate sent,
first of all,

1141
00:55:03,561 --> 00:55:04,394
he sent completely rambling,
frightening notes to the bar owner 

1142
00:55:08,391 --> 00:55:09,224
telling him not to host us and it was 
very touching because it's borrowing or 

1143
00:55:12,200 --> 00:55:13,033
was talking to me.
He was worried that what he has this 

1144
00:55:16,010 --> 00:55:19,580
critic made it sound like,
like he was hosting some,

1145
00:55:19,640 --> 00:55:20,473
you know,
I dunno some Nazis or something and the 

1146
00:55:24,591 --> 00:55:26,090
bar owner said,
what can I do?

1147
00:55:26,091 --> 00:55:28,100
This is America.
And he was,

1148
00:55:28,370 --> 00:55:30,140
he was from Afghanistan,
I think,

1149
00:55:30,150 --> 00:55:31,020
rooted in,
in a minute,

1150
00:55:31,100 --> 00:55:33,500
immigrant or maybe a rocky said,
what can I do?

1151
00:55:33,501 --> 00:55:35,600
This is America.
And he said,

1152
00:55:35,601 --> 00:55:37,070
are you going to keep us out?
He said No.

1153
00:55:37,490 --> 00:55:40,010
And then I,
they were so pleased because.

1154
00:55:40,080 --> 00:55:40,913
And everybody was very generous because 
we felt bad that they got a bomb threat 

1155
00:55:44,450 --> 00:55:47,300
and the imagine making a bomb threat in 
DC.

1156
00:55:47,420 --> 00:55:50,780
They brought in vans and police dogs.
But of course being gamers,

1157
00:55:50,781 --> 00:55:52,640
we just went outside.
They partied outside.

1158
00:55:53,170 --> 00:55:54,420
All right.
So it had a,

1159
00:55:54,421 --> 00:55:55,254
it had a nice ending.
And I suppose that's all that we can do 

1160
00:55:57,601 --> 00:55:58,434
is just,
you just keep going and you just keep 

1161
00:55:59,611 --> 00:56:00,444
telling the truth and all that.
Which sort of gets me to my last 

1162
00:56:02,161 --> 00:56:02,994
question,
which is I've been trying to end all 

1163
00:56:03,870 --> 00:56:06,560
these interviews on the hope part of all
this.

1164
00:56:06,690 --> 00:56:07,523
Where do we go from here?
With all the things we've been talking 

1165
00:56:09,781 --> 00:56:11,020
about?
And uh,

1166
00:56:11,190 --> 00:56:12,023
I think you were in a piece that I owe 
that Milo is also in about the rise of 

1167
00:56:15,181 --> 00:56:16,014
the cultural libertarians.
That there is this group of people now 

1168
00:56:18,601 --> 00:56:19,434
that cut across the political spectrum 
that include Bill Maher and rock and 

1169
00:56:24,581 --> 00:56:29,581
people on the right like Milo and people
on the left at that have realized we got

1170
00:56:30,421 --> 00:56:34,450
to get out of people's personal lives.
We got to stop othering everybody.

1171
00:56:34,451 --> 00:56:35,284
We got to stop judging everybody based 
on color and sex and religion and all 

1172
00:56:38,381 --> 00:56:39,214
that.
I'm a firm believer that this is the 

1173
00:56:41,921 --> 00:56:42,754
next political movement in this country.
So I guess are you with me and give me 

1174
00:56:47,741 --> 00:56:48,574
something else

1175
00:56:48,880 --> 00:56:49,713
totally with you.
And I think that it was my acquaintance 

1176
00:56:51,491 --> 00:56:52,324
with the gamers that gave me that hope 
because politically they all over the 

1177
00:56:54,971 --> 00:56:57,640
spectrum but they are very libertarian 
for sure.

1178
00:56:58,480 --> 00:56:59,313
And this was their,
how they were acting and I just thought 

1179
00:57:01,181 --> 00:57:04,660
that it got some insight into how they 
were and and two,

1180
00:57:04,840 --> 00:57:07,290
because they are younger.
I mean they're gamers are a lot,

1181
00:57:07,480 --> 00:57:09,310
a lot younger than me,
most of them.

1182
00:57:09,730 --> 00:57:11,620
And that gives me hope.
And,

1183
00:57:11,680 --> 00:57:14,200
and I.
What I like about it too is it can unite

1184
00:57:14,201 --> 00:57:17,890
us from people who were concerned.
I'm still a registered Democrat,

1185
00:57:17,891 --> 00:57:21,430
but out of respect for my mother and 
father who are so liberal,

1186
00:57:22,180 --> 00:57:23,800
I wouldn't dare her register anything 
else,

1187
00:57:24,280 --> 00:57:27,790
but they.
But you can be conservative,

1188
00:57:27,791 --> 00:57:28,624
you can be liberal.
What unites us as Americans and maybe 

1189
00:57:31,640 --> 00:57:32,990
he's.
Yeah,

1190
00:57:33,820 --> 00:57:38,350
in Westerners to it is a love of 
freedom.

1191
00:57:38,490 --> 00:57:39,910
Yeah.
I mean that's our.

1192
00:57:40,180 --> 00:57:45,180
So I think it can bring people together 
and we've right now it's not,

1193
00:57:45,330 --> 00:57:46,163
it's,
it's sort of the bullies have the upper 

1194
00:57:47,741 --> 00:57:51,760
hand and so it's going to be a battle to
um,

1195
00:57:52,120 --> 00:57:55,590
take the power away from them and give 
to where it belongs to people who just,

1196
00:57:55,860 --> 00:57:56,693
who are nice,
respectful and who want a of other 

1197
00:57:59,981 --> 00:58:03,690
people and realize other people have 
different opinions and,

1198
00:58:03,730 --> 00:58:07,300
and that that's okay.
And not to be policing.

1199
00:58:07,301 --> 00:58:11,440
I don't want these authoritarians here 
who said they could make the rules,

1200
00:58:11,441 --> 00:58:14,240
your arguments for censorship and,
and,

1201
00:58:14,250 --> 00:58:16,750
and doing away with due process.
They're not going to work.

1202
00:58:16,751 --> 00:58:20,140
They had been tried before with that 
with unhappy results.

1203
00:58:20,141 --> 00:58:22,570
So read some history.
But having said that,

1204
00:58:23,050 --> 00:58:26,860
I do think and any crazy things 
happening on campus right now,

1205
00:58:27,280 --> 00:58:32,200
it's maybe a good thing if people are 
seeing it and will not be so easy.

1206
00:58:32,500 --> 00:58:33,820
So ready to jump on it.

1207
00:58:33,870 --> 00:58:35,100
Yeah.
That to me,

1208
00:58:35,101 --> 00:58:35,934
that's the hope that I've been trying to
take for the last few weeks that even 

1209
00:58:37,980 --> 00:58:38,813
even in cable news,
which is so endlessly dumb and and 

1210
00:58:41,280 --> 00:58:44,880
pandering that I was noticing people 
were starting to say,

1211
00:58:45,140 --> 00:58:45,973
you know,
where they'll cry racism every two 

1212
00:58:46,981 --> 00:58:49,650
seconds and sexism and homophobia for 
the first time.

1213
00:58:49,651 --> 00:58:51,450
They were kind of coming around and 
being like,

1214
00:58:51,900 --> 00:58:55,150
this might be a bit much.
So that's got to be that.

1215
00:58:55,190 --> 00:58:56,030
That.
Yeah,

1216
00:58:56,040 --> 00:58:57,710
that's a good sign.
That's a good time.

1217
00:58:57,810 --> 00:58:58,561
Well,
what would you say?

1218
00:58:58,561 --> 00:58:59,394
Just the average person that,
that not someone that's in the public 

1219
00:59:01,321 --> 00:59:02,154
sphere,
but the average person that wants to do 

1220
00:59:04,621 --> 00:59:07,270
something about this in their,
in their.

1221
00:59:07,800 --> 00:59:10,800
I would suggest that you be somewhat 
skeptical,

1222
00:59:11,280 --> 00:59:14,850
not get too carried away with a cause 
until you check the facts.

1223
00:59:14,970 --> 00:59:17,400
Now,
if you've got good information and moral

1224
00:59:17,401 --> 00:59:19,710
energy,
that's moral progress.

1225
00:59:19,980 --> 00:59:22,550
That's Martin King.
That's civil rights.

1226
00:59:22,820 --> 00:59:25,310
If you have bad information and moral 
fervor,

1227
00:59:25,550 --> 00:59:30,410
that's fanaticism and history is one 
long lesson and the dangers of combining

1228
00:59:30,411 --> 00:59:32,810
misinformation and moral fervor,
so be careful.

1229
00:59:32,900 --> 00:59:34,820
Choose your costs,
causes carefully.

1230
00:59:35,390 --> 00:59:37,160
And um,
if you were,

1231
00:59:37,550 --> 00:59:39,020
if you do that,
I think it'll,

1232
00:59:39,170 --> 00:59:40,003
you know,
that that leads to progress to being 

1233
00:59:41,811 --> 00:59:44,060
careful about your causes.
And right now,

1234
00:59:44,090 --> 00:59:46,400
if you are a woman and you a part of 
campus feminism,

1235
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:49,610
I hate to say this,
you have chosen the wrong cost.

1236
00:59:49,660 --> 00:59:52,640
It's not about liberty,
it's about repression.

1237
00:59:52,670 --> 00:59:53,181
Well,
you know what,

1238
00:59:53,181 --> 00:59:55,790
I look forward to seeing some of the 
comments on this one.

1239
00:59:55,791 --> 00:59:57,500
We'll see if they agree with you and if 
they agree,

1240
00:59:57,501 --> 00:59:59,180
great.
And I have a feeling if they disagree,

1241
00:59:59,181 --> 01:00:01,160
you'll be okay with that too.
I'm okay with that.

1242
01:00:01,190 --> 01:00:03,290
She gave me the evidence.
Persuadable.

1243
01:00:03,320 --> 01:00:03,891
There you go.
Well,

1244
01:00:03,891 --> 01:00:04,724
it was a pleasure meeting you.
Finally in actual life we realize we've 

1245
01:00:07,431 --> 01:00:08,264
been doing this and this on twitter.
One hundred 40 character thing and I 

1246
01:00:10,911 --> 01:00:11,744
really appreciated the fact that you 
literally went from almost four hours 

1247
01:00:14,571 --> 01:00:16,790
with Joe right over here.
And,

1248
01:00:16,791 --> 01:00:17,720
uh,
what are you going to do for the rest of

1249
01:00:17,721 --> 01:00:18,410
them?

1250
01:00:18,410 --> 01:00:22,880
I'm meeting my nephew and we're going 
out for Margarita is Mexican food.

1251
01:00:23,270 --> 01:00:24,021
Excellent.
All right,

1252
01:00:24,021 --> 01:00:24,854
well,
you guys can check out Christina Hoff 

1253
01:00:26,031 --> 01:00:29,510
summers and all the usual spots on 
twitter on youtube.

1254
01:00:29,511 --> 01:00:32,720
It is the factual feminist.
And uh,

1255
01:00:32,770 --> 01:00:35,450
I thank you again and I look forward to 
seeing you guys next week.
