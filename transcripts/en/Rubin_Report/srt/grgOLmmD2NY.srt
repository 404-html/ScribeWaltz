00:00:02,610 --> 00:00:03,443
My guest this week is Kelly Carlin,
daughter of the legendary comedian 

2
00:00:05,791 --> 00:00:06,624
George Carlin.
Kelly is an author and a speaker who's 

3
00:00:08,371 --> 00:00:11,280
work connects many of the dots her 
father's life was all about.

4
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:15,150
I've known Kelly for about four years 
now after connecting with her on twitter

5
00:00:15,390 --> 00:00:18,720
because of how much I admired her dad,
we become great friends.

6
00:00:18,721 --> 00:00:19,554
Kelly is welcomed me into her world and 
the comedy community She's part of here 

7
00:00:22,651 --> 00:00:23,484
in la.
I thought Kelly would be the perfect 

8
00:00:24,571 --> 00:00:25,404
guest this week,
not only because of her new book about 

9
00:00:26,851 --> 00:00:27,684
growing up as a Carlin,
but also because of all the issues her 

10
00:00:30,241 --> 00:00:31,074
father's comedy was about that it 
becomes central themes of what we do 

11
00:00:34,021 --> 00:00:34,854
here on this show.
George Carlin was a relentless defender 

12
00:00:37,381 --> 00:00:41,550
of free speech using words and language 
to push the limits of what society found

13
00:00:41,551 --> 00:00:44,850
acceptable at the time he railed against
political correctness.

14
00:00:44,910 --> 00:00:45,743
Like no other comment before or anybody 
since he dissected the absurdities of 

15
00:00:49,441 --> 00:00:53,340
life that ultimately bring us together 
rather than rip us apart.

16
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:54,533
I can't tell you how often I'm watching 
some campaign nonsense or some 

17
00:00:56,851 --> 00:00:59,280
ridiculous politically correct crusade 
and think,

18
00:00:59,310 --> 00:01:00,143
man,
I wish George Carlin was still alive to 

19
00:01:01,651 --> 00:01:02,484
tackle this.
Not only do I want you to see George 

20
00:01:04,530 --> 00:01:06,480
Carlin in a new way by sitting down with
Kelly,

21
00:01:06,481 --> 00:01:08,970
but I also want to use our chat as a 
living,

22
00:01:08,971 --> 00:01:11,820
breathing example of something else 
that's going on here.

23
00:01:12,090 --> 00:01:14,130
As I mentioned,
Kelly and I met on twitter.

24
00:01:14,430 --> 00:01:15,263
All I was to her was another person 
tweeting at her in 140 characters who 

25
00:01:18,271 --> 00:01:21,270
had some connection to her father,
like millions of other people,

26
00:01:21,630 --> 00:01:23,940
but through social media we met,
we became friends,

27
00:01:23,941 --> 00:01:26,940
and now we share so much of our lives 
and our passions together.

28
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:27,953
To me,
that's what's so cool about what's 

29
00:01:29,011 --> 00:01:30,450
happening here with you guys.

30
00:01:30,630 --> 00:01:33,450
The reaction to what we're doing has 
gotten to a whole new level.

31
00:01:33,660 --> 00:01:36,090
I've been getting emails from literally 
all over the world,

32
00:01:36,091 --> 00:01:36,924
from Denmark to Saudi Arabia to Mexico.
We're connecting because of the same 

33
00:01:40,261 --> 00:01:44,040
ideas that George believed in,
which I believe in and which you believe

34
00:01:44,041 --> 00:01:44,851
in.
By the way,

35
00:01:44,851 --> 00:01:47,130
that doesn't mean that we agree on 
everything actually,

36
00:01:47,131 --> 00:01:50,280
in almost every email I get that's 
heaping praise on me.

37
00:01:50,281 --> 00:01:52,770
You guys managed to tell me something 
that we disagree on.

38
00:01:52,771 --> 00:01:53,604
I love that.
That's what this is all about and it's 

39
00:01:55,351 --> 00:01:59,280
precisely what the far right and the 
regressive left fear.

40
00:01:59,490 --> 00:02:00,323
If the rest of us can wake up and 
realize that we can come together 

41
00:02:02,491 --> 00:02:04,860
despite differences,
then they can't control us.

42
00:02:04,861 --> 00:02:05,694
It's really as simple as that.
The authoritarians that exist on both 

43
00:02:08,131 --> 00:02:08,964
sides want control,
and the best way to do that is to keep 

44
00:02:11,911 --> 00:02:13,830
everyone hating on each other all the 
time.

45
00:02:14,130 --> 00:02:16,980
For all the things that Milo 
Yiannopoulos and I disagreed on,

46
00:02:16,981 --> 00:02:21,981
this is one spot we had total agreement.
The rise of the Cultural Libertarians is

47
00:02:21,991 --> 00:02:25,260
here and it contains people from all 
over the cultural map,

48
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:29,040
from Chris Rock to Bill Maher,
from marginalized to Sam Harris.

49
00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:32,490
If George Carlin was still around,
I think he would fit right in there,

50
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:33,473
but it would have also been shared to 
make fun of any group that would have 

51
00:02:35,641 --> 00:02:39,000
accepted him as part of it.
The point of all this is that every week

52
00:02:39,001 --> 00:02:39,834
actually,
every day that I've been doing this 

53
00:02:41,131 --> 00:02:43,410
show,
I see this movement getting stronger.

54
00:02:43,650 --> 00:02:46,320
You guys are not only connecting with me
but with each other,

55
00:02:46,530 --> 00:02:49,710
and now when I see the usual regressive 
spout off their nonsense,

56
00:02:49,711 --> 00:02:52,020
there's an army of people calling them 
out on it.

57
00:02:52,260 --> 00:02:55,530
That is literally as important as 
anything that I do.

58
00:02:55,650 --> 00:02:58,230
George Carlin's most famous routine was 
the seven dirty words.

59
00:02:58,231 --> 00:03:00,040
You can't say on TV.
We live

60
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:00,873
in a time that's getting dangerously 
close to the several dirty ideas that 

61
00:03:03,701 --> 00:03:07,210
you can't challenge publicly.
Let's honor the trailblazers before us,

62
00:03:07,211 --> 00:03:08,044
like George Carlin,
by relentlessly challenging and 

63
00:03:10,391 --> 00:03:13,060
ruthlessly mocking those who would 
attempt to silence us.

64
00:03:13,420 --> 00:03:14,440
Alright,
let's do a show.

65
00:03:17,170 --> 00:03:19,660
My guest this week is an author,
a speaker,

66
00:03:19,661 --> 00:03:22,710
and a one woman show or something,
right?

67
00:03:23,350 --> 00:03:24,183
Her new book,
a Carlin home companion tells her 

68
00:03:25,841 --> 00:03:28,970
journey growing up as the daughter of 
George and Brenda Carla,

69
00:03:28,971 --> 00:03:31,090
and she's also my friend and throws a 
hell of a party.

70
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:31,871
Kelly,
Carla,

71
00:03:31,871 --> 00:03:34,780
and welcome to the show.
I'm so excited to be here.

72
00:03:34,781 --> 00:03:35,614
This is so fabulous.
Doesn't it seem more mature than 

73
00:03:37,871 --> 00:03:40,300
anything we've done?
We've grown up right now.

74
00:03:40,301 --> 00:03:42,760
This is kind of scaring me.
This is very grown up.

75
00:03:43,300 --> 00:03:44,133
Before we start,
you just pointed to our window at this 

76
00:03:49,420 --> 00:03:54,070
picture in case now I know we're,
we're blowing the illusion television,

77
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:55,780
but that is a picture.

78
00:03:55,780 --> 00:03:57,760
It's not an actual window that is,
uh,

79
00:03:57,790 --> 00:03:58,623
the upper west side that's 89th street 
facing north and just a little bit past 

80
00:04:03,131 --> 00:04:03,964
where this picture ends is actually just
in the last year a street that is now 

81
00:04:08,201 --> 00:04:09,034
named after your father.
This isn't where I was intending to 

82
00:04:10,901 --> 00:04:11,481
start with,
but let,

83
00:04:11,481 --> 00:04:13,000
let's start there.
Your Dad now is a street,

84
00:04:13,450 --> 00:04:18,220
has officially a street a at 121st and 
Amsterdam.

85
00:04:18,580 --> 00:04:21,280
We wanted it to be between Broadway and 
Amsterdam,

86
00:04:21,281 --> 00:04:23,990
but there's.
And that was the block he grew up on,

87
00:04:24,220 --> 00:04:26,380
but there's also a church there.
The church,

88
00:04:26,381 --> 00:04:29,530
his mother attended the church that they
had,

89
00:04:29,531 --> 00:04:33,190
the school that he attended as a child.
He was kicked out of that church,

90
00:04:33,191 --> 00:04:34,024
right?
Wasn't where he was kicked out of the 

91
00:04:34,471 --> 00:04:36,010
school,
let take down to the school.

92
00:04:36,011 --> 00:04:38,650
And then he was allowed to come back to 
graduate for eighth grade,

93
00:04:38,651 --> 00:04:42,070
but he had to write the play in order to
get back in which they were great.

94
00:04:42,100 --> 00:04:44,710
It was actually a very progressive 
school for a Catholic school.

95
00:04:45,170 --> 00:04:47,060
Um,
but the irony is,

96
00:04:47,061 --> 00:04:49,030
is that once we wanted to name the 
street,

97
00:04:49,031 --> 00:04:52,990
the church,
I'm a got all up in arms about it,

98
00:04:53,010 --> 00:04:53,843
a worried well,
they claimed that they were worried 

99
00:04:56,771 --> 00:04:57,604
about kids coming out of school and 
looking up and seeing the name and then 

100
00:05:01,150 --> 00:05:01,983
googling it and finding out about the 
seven dirty words that was their 

101
00:05:04,181 --> 00:05:05,200
concern.
Also,

102
00:05:05,201 --> 00:05:09,910
not a huge fan of religion,
never more worried about the religion is

103
00:05:09,911 --> 00:05:14,740
bullshit video that they would probably 
find on youtube video.

104
00:05:14,741 --> 00:05:17,750
There must be 50 of them.
There is probably as a.

105
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:19,210
we're working on that.
We're trying to,

106
00:05:19,230 --> 00:05:20,800
you know,
organize all of that.

107
00:05:20,801 --> 00:05:21,760
But,
but yeah,

108
00:05:21,761 --> 00:05:25,480
but you can go to 121st and Amsterdam on
the other side of the street.

109
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:28,510
And uh,
there is a George Carlin way,

110
00:05:28,870 --> 00:05:29,703
so just to be clear,
they live so it's on the same street 

111
00:05:31,961 --> 00:05:34,030
street,
but they just pushed it one block,

112
00:05:34,350 --> 00:05:38,820
they just put it across the street on 
Amsterdam because I mean it's,

113
00:05:38,860 --> 00:05:39,940
it's,
once again,

114
00:05:39,941 --> 00:05:40,774
it's just the thing that churches have 
these lines that they draw and they're 

115
00:05:44,741 --> 00:05:45,310
ridiculous.

116
00:05:45,310 --> 00:05:46,143
But the good news is,
is that when all this went down was it 

117
00:05:48,431 --> 00:05:52,540
got us so much press that it ended up 
being like a kind of a funny thing.

118
00:05:52,541 --> 00:05:53,374
They actually got us more attention for 
the street sign that I think they 

119
00:05:55,931 --> 00:05:58,850
probably would have wanted,
although every comic in the world wanted

120
00:05:58,851 --> 00:05:59,684
to be there that day.
And you had a Zillion zillion amazing 

121
00:06:02,361 --> 00:06:03,950
day.
And Kevin Bartini the comic.

122
00:06:03,951 --> 00:06:06,980
He's the one who initiated it and did it
all.

123
00:06:06,981 --> 00:06:07,814
But Yeah,
we had Colin Quinn and Dave attell and 

124
00:06:10,340 --> 00:06:11,660
I'm just,
you know,

125
00:06:11,750 --> 00:06:13,130
it was,
it was a great day.

126
00:06:13,420 --> 00:06:14,253
Well,
I love the fact that what I'm putting 

127
00:06:15,171 --> 00:06:15,741
right here,
this,

128
00:06:15,741 --> 00:06:17,750
we did this because I used to live on 
the upper west side.

129
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:20,210
So it's a nice.
It's a nice way to feel at home.

130
00:06:20,330 --> 00:06:21,800
Yeah,
so as I said in my intro,

131
00:06:21,830 --> 00:06:24,050
one of the things that I that I love 
about having you here,

132
00:06:24,051 --> 00:06:25,850
and we've been doing this kind of stuff 
forever,

133
00:06:26,060 --> 00:06:26,893
but one of the reasons that I think is 
particularly apropos now beyond just 

134
00:06:29,691 --> 00:06:32,990
your book is that all of the things that
your dad stood for,

135
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:36,170
I think are really coming to fruition 
right now.

136
00:06:36,170 --> 00:06:38,170
There's something again,
right?

137
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:39,610
It's a cyclical thing.
Yeah.

138
00:06:39,620 --> 00:06:40,453
It's like this endless thing,
but I feel like there's a moment now 

139
00:06:42,980 --> 00:06:46,730
between religion and political 
correctness and free speech,

140
00:06:46,731 --> 00:06:50,540
these things that he railed on more than
anybody and did better than anybody.

141
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:52,910
They're all coming back right now.
So before we get into that,

142
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:54,333
let's let's do something a little bit.
We'll give them a little hint from the 

143
00:06:56,481 --> 00:06:58,070
book.
Give me something about your dad on,

144
00:06:58,190 --> 00:07:02,180
on the private side,
because this is someone who talked about

145
00:07:02,181 --> 00:07:05,480
culture,
not necessarily talked about himself,

146
00:07:05,510 --> 00:07:06,970
so let's just do a little of that.
He,

147
00:07:07,030 --> 00:07:12,030
he was one of those comics which really 
didn't come to me until he died,

148
00:07:12,351 --> 00:07:15,500
really?
But that who really did focus on,

149
00:07:16,310 --> 00:07:18,500
I mean he focused on,
he talked about three things,

150
00:07:18,501 --> 00:07:20,810
you focused on the little things that we
all share.

151
00:07:20,811 --> 00:07:21,644
So that was the observational humor 
stuff in the refrigerator man and the 

152
00:07:26,541 --> 00:07:28,280
airline announcements and things like 
that.

153
00:07:28,670 --> 00:07:31,580
He focused on language,
which is another thing that we all share

154
00:07:31,581 --> 00:07:34,880
as a culture and then he like would go 
after the big subjects,

155
00:07:35,180 --> 00:07:36,980
death,
religion,

156
00:07:37,010 --> 00:07:38,840
children,
things like that.

157
00:07:39,230 --> 00:07:41,180
Um,
but he never,

158
00:07:41,450 --> 00:07:46,450
he mentioned me once in a routine in 
like 1971,

159
00:07:47,370 --> 00:07:50,750
one of the earlier albums where I was 
very excited.

160
00:07:50,930 --> 00:07:52,820
He was talking about,
um,

161
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:55,580
what's a euphemism for Shit,
you know,

162
00:07:55,581 --> 00:07:59,060
we call it number two and P as number 
one and how once I figured that out,

163
00:07:59,061 --> 00:08:01,610
I made funny combinations up and things 
like that.

164
00:08:02,150 --> 00:08:05,030
And that was the only time I was ever 
taught about.

165
00:08:05,510 --> 00:08:07,790
And for comics,
you know,

166
00:08:07,791 --> 00:08:12,230
99 percent of the time,
their material is their family and their

167
00:08:12,231 --> 00:08:13,490
personal life.
So,

168
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:14,593
um,
my dad was very different than that and 

169
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:18,350
he didn't.
And he wrote a memoir,

170
00:08:18,351 --> 00:08:21,650
but we didn't publish it until we 
published it.

171
00:08:21,651 --> 00:08:23,390
After he died,
so,

172
00:08:23,391 --> 00:08:25,090
um,
what do you think that was,

173
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:27,530
was about because he's so got into the 
mind.

174
00:08:27,530 --> 00:08:31,310
He so got into the very bit of us that 
we all share.

175
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:35,250
And yet that part he did.
Was that respect maybe to your mom or to

176
00:08:35,270 --> 00:08:38,900
your family or.
I don't know.

177
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:39,913
I think,
I think his mind just didn't travel 

178
00:08:42,561 --> 00:08:43,394
there.
His mind was out here and that's just 

179
00:08:46,221 --> 00:08:49,250
the way his focus was.
And uh,

180
00:08:49,700 --> 00:08:50,533
so it was kind of weird because I would,
growing up I would see other comedians 

181
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:58,740
about their families and it did hit me a
few times,

182
00:08:58,741 --> 00:08:59,574
especially like teenagers.
Like why Sydney ever talk about us on 

183
00:09:03,061 --> 00:09:03,894
like the tonight show.
I remember one time he went on the 

184
00:09:05,071 --> 00:09:10,071
tonight show with Carson as the host and
Carson asked about his family and he had

185
00:09:10,411 --> 00:09:14,820
these funny made up sons that he talked 
about dark dot Gagnon was one of them,

186
00:09:14,821 --> 00:09:18,090
which I mean it was a great bit,
but I just feel,

187
00:09:18,270 --> 00:09:21,210
I already know I've already felt a 
little invisible.

188
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:24,300
Therefore I felt even a little more 
invisible at that time.

189
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:29,640
And yet I think I'm happy about it 
because I wasn't,

190
00:09:29,641 --> 00:09:34,641
my life wasn't fodder for his comedy,
whereas my poor dad,

191
00:09:35,630 --> 00:09:40,620
our life together has become fodder for 
my art series a,

192
00:09:40,890 --> 00:09:43,770
which was a bone of contention for us.
Uh,

193
00:09:43,810 --> 00:09:44,643
and I,
and I do talk about that in the book 

194
00:09:45,691 --> 00:09:47,390
and,
and not so much as artists,

195
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:48,233
but that there were some things that we 
had never talked about as a family that 

196
00:09:50,881 --> 00:09:53,310
I really was willing to talk about on 
stage.

197
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:57,840
Like people like spalding gray and um,
uh,

198
00:09:57,841 --> 00:09:58,620
you know,
uh,

199
00:09:58,620 --> 00:10:02,280
Sandra Tsing Loh and these other solo 
artists did,

200
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:03,080
uh,
you know,

201
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:04,740
they go out and comedians.
I mean,

202
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:09,690
I think a lot of comedians are way more 
comfortable going on stage talking about

203
00:10:09,691 --> 00:10:10,524
their life there than having to go home 
and having a serious conversation with 

204
00:10:12,901 --> 00:10:13,640
their loved ones.

205
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:14,061
Yeah.
Well,

206
00:10:14,061 --> 00:10:18,170
we'll get to the sad clown thing.
It'll look to address that.

207
00:10:18,171 --> 00:10:19,004
You do address that in your one woman 
show that was sort of a lead up to the 

208
00:10:21,741 --> 00:10:22,574
book that there there's a sort of 
beautiful moment where you and your dad 

209
00:10:24,651 --> 00:10:25,484
are talking and he sort of,
there was like a little bit of sense of 

210
00:10:27,351 --> 00:10:32,351
betrayal or a sense that he was going to
be exposed in a way that he had an done

211
00:10:33,260 --> 00:10:34,093
and I think ultimately,
I mean what happened was I wrote a solo 

212
00:10:35,811 --> 00:10:36,644
show and I sent him the script and 
inside the script I talked about having 

213
00:10:41,991 --> 00:10:42,824
some feelings,
some negative feelings about when my 

214
00:10:44,061 --> 00:10:44,894
mother was dying and he had to go on the
road and it was a conversation my dad 

215
00:10:47,391 --> 00:10:48,224
and I had never had and we didn't have 
any real healthy conversation closure 

216
00:10:51,831 --> 00:10:53,420
around it.
But,

217
00:10:53,590 --> 00:10:54,261
and I,
and I,

218
00:10:54,261 --> 00:10:55,094
looking back on it now,
I think sending him that script was my 

219
00:10:57,411 --> 00:10:59,630
way of saying,
hey,

220
00:10:59,930 --> 00:11:00,763
I have these feelings,
but this was one of the themes I wanted 

221
00:11:03,921 --> 00:11:08,120
to work on in the book was that here's 
this man who is the truth teller.

222
00:11:08,150 --> 00:11:10,220
Like you said at opening of the show.
I mean,

223
00:11:10,221 --> 00:11:11,054
this is the man who conquered everything
was fearless and we'll talk about all 

224
00:11:14,241 --> 00:11:17,240
the big stuff that our culture does not 
want to talk about on stage.

225
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:21,800
And yet when it came to our family,
we were very much the textbook,

226
00:11:21,890 --> 00:11:26,890
dysfunctional alcoholic family that did 
a lot of walking on eggshells,

227
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:28,033
didn't do a lot of intimate talking 
about the issues and we all pretended 

228
00:11:32,451 --> 00:11:34,230
that we were fine.
You know,

229
00:11:34,250 --> 00:11:36,980
we all worked for the American family 
truly.

230
00:11:36,981 --> 00:11:37,814
And that's.
And that's like when people talk about 

231
00:11:39,081 --> 00:11:40,080
my book and they're like,
oh,

232
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:41,450
you have such a unique life.
I'm like,

233
00:11:41,660 --> 00:11:42,420
yeah,
not.

234
00:11:42,420 --> 00:11:43,253
I mean I did,
but kind of like the all American 

235
00:11:45,650 --> 00:11:46,520
family.
Yeah.

236
00:11:46,780 --> 00:11:49,040
So I don't want to delve too deep 
because I want people.

237
00:11:49,100 --> 00:11:50,420
I want people to buy the books,
of course.

238
00:11:50,421 --> 00:11:51,920
So that.
So that's an important piece of this.

239
00:11:51,921 --> 00:11:55,090
But just one more thing on that.
Um,

240
00:11:55,300 --> 00:11:57,250
did you have a sense when you were 
growing up,

241
00:11:57,280 --> 00:11:58,120
you know,
your dad,

242
00:11:58,240 --> 00:11:58,811
look,
there were,

243
00:11:58,811 --> 00:11:59,644
there were drug things that you talked 
about in the book and in the show 

244
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:03,160
arrests,
you know,

245
00:12:03,161 --> 00:12:03,994
he was,
he was arrested that night that Lenny 

246
00:12:05,110 --> 00:12:05,941
Bruce was arrested.
Right?

247
00:12:05,941 --> 00:12:06,701
And is that.
Yeah,

248
00:12:06,701 --> 00:12:07,534
that was before I was born.
But these types of things that were 

249
00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:11,810
going on,
he was on the front lines.

250
00:12:11,811 --> 00:12:14,710
So how much of that do you,
were you conscious,

251
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:19,030
especially in your early years that your
dad really was this,

252
00:12:19,060 --> 00:12:20,050
this legend?
I mean,

253
00:12:20,051 --> 00:12:20,884
when you,
when there's the Mount Rushmore of 

254
00:12:21,401 --> 00:12:22,234
comedy,
it's,

255
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:23,830
you know,
half the people say it's your dad.

256
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:24,873
Half the people say it's prior and then 
maybe there's one percent that gets 

257
00:12:27,041 --> 00:12:28,740
split amongst lenny bruce and a couple 
of years,

258
00:12:30,540 --> 00:12:35,540
the legend kind of route mount rushmore 
thing really happened more when I was in

259
00:12:35,641 --> 00:12:37,740
my twenties.
And uh,

260
00:12:37,780 --> 00:12:38,730
I was at a,
uh,

261
00:12:39,190 --> 00:12:40,023
uh,
an English class at Ucla and my 

262
00:12:41,611 --> 00:12:43,320
professor says,
you know,

263
00:12:43,321 --> 00:12:46,470
we're going to study a compare and 
contrast essays today.

264
00:12:46,620 --> 00:12:49,740
And I have a perfect example of,
of how you should go about this,

265
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:53,880
and he pushes the play button on a 
boombox and my dad's baseball,

266
00:12:53,881 --> 00:12:54,714
football routine comes out and I'm 
sitting there in this class of like 25 

267
00:12:57,661 --> 00:13:00,360
people looking around going,
um,

268
00:13:00,940 --> 00:13:01,650
is anyone else

269
00:13:01,650 --> 00:13:02,483
having this weird experience?
Are you going to play any shit from 

270
00:13:05,250 --> 00:13:09,090
anyone else's dad?
Maybe that's when you realize,

271
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:10,073
oh yeah,
big dent in the culture has happened 

272
00:13:12,991 --> 00:13:14,400
here.
Um,

273
00:13:14,940 --> 00:13:16,050
so,
you know,

274
00:13:16,051 --> 00:13:18,870
I think it was from that point on that I
knew like legend,

275
00:13:18,871 --> 00:13:19,704
but even before that I knew that he was 
obviously famous and people worshiped 

276
00:13:23,281 --> 00:13:24,114
him and,
and all that kind of stuff and was 

277
00:13:25,921 --> 00:13:27,090
around for,
you know,

278
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:31,380
an arrest or two of his also.
So I knew he was definitely on the front

279
00:13:31,381 --> 00:13:32,280
lines of something.

280
00:13:32,300 --> 00:13:34,280
So let's get into some of the,
some of the themes that,

281
00:13:34,281 --> 00:13:36,410
as I said,
I have become the central themes of,

282
00:13:36,411 --> 00:13:38,350
of what I'm trying to do here,
because you're,

283
00:13:38,380 --> 00:13:39,500
you know,
I say to you all the time,

284
00:13:39,501 --> 00:13:40,334
as I said in the Intro,
I'm watching the news constantly and I 

285
00:13:43,371 --> 00:13:45,980
like either text you sometimes or I'll 
call you and be like,

286
00:13:46,010 --> 00:13:48,390
God,
I wish your dad was around because.

287
00:13:48,570 --> 00:13:50,720
Because I can't do it.
That can certainly.

288
00:13:50,810 --> 00:13:53,240
And I don't know anyone else that can,
that can skewer stuff in that way.

289
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:55,490
So let's just hit a couple of them.
So the religion one,

290
00:13:55,491 --> 00:13:58,760
so you already mentioned a little bit 
about his history with religion.

291
00:13:59,110 --> 00:14:00,980
Was,
was he an atheist?

292
00:14:00,981 --> 00:14:03,800
Did he describe himself in any specific 
way?

293
00:14:03,801 --> 00:14:04,634
Right.

294
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:05,593
He did not use the term atheist.
He felt atheism was as dogmatic as any 

295
00:14:11,061 --> 00:14:14,270
other ism out there.
Um,

296
00:14:14,810 --> 00:14:16,400
uh,
you know,

297
00:14:16,401 --> 00:14:20,390
lately I've been introduced to what they
call the humanist,

298
00:14:20,690 --> 00:14:21,770
uh,
you know,

299
00:14:21,771 --> 00:14:22,604
kind of community,
which is something I relate to a lot 

300
00:14:24,561 --> 00:14:25,394
more.
I think he would have felt better about 

301
00:14:26,601 --> 00:14:28,250
that.
It sounds like they're not going to have

302
00:14:28,251 --> 00:14:30,530
as many meetings and armbands and things
like that,

303
00:14:30,531 --> 00:14:33,050
which you used to talk about groups 
because it's things less koolaid.

304
00:14:33,051 --> 00:14:34,640
I think he felt any,
you know,

305
00:14:34,820 --> 00:14:35,653
any group of people you get group think,
and then where does the individual 

306
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:40,410
thinking,
you know,

307
00:14:40,420 --> 00:14:43,520
happen in that situation?
So that always worried him.

308
00:14:44,060 --> 00:14:45,910
Uh,
I think he's self,

309
00:14:46,300 --> 00:14:49,310
you know,
named himself mostly as an agnostic.

310
00:14:49,730 --> 00:14:50,563
Um,
obviously didn't believe in the man in 

311
00:14:52,401 --> 00:14:53,234
the sky with the beard thing.
It's not like he was thinking of that 

312
00:14:55,221 --> 00:14:56,054
was a possibility,
but he had a deep sense of oneness with 

313
00:15:00,081 --> 00:15:00,710
the universe.

314
00:15:00,710 --> 00:15:05,370
He loved astronomy.
He loved that idea of looking up and um,

315
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:07,910
you know,
that feeling you get when you look at me

316
00:15:07,911 --> 00:15:08,571
like,
Jesus,

317
00:15:08,571 --> 00:15:09,404
we're just a speck here.
And yet there's something about that 

318
00:15:11,901 --> 00:15:15,920
being a Spec that expands us at the same
time.

319
00:15:15,921 --> 00:15:18,180
So there was something around that.
Um,

320
00:15:18,890 --> 00:15:19,723
he was a man who dropped acid in the 
sixties and had some transcendent 

321
00:15:22,971 --> 00:15:26,120
experiences about that.
And talk to me about,

322
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:27,433
um,
being a high and having an experience 

323
00:15:32,661 --> 00:15:35,660
where he realized that he really was at 
one with everything,

324
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:36,913
including the old tennis shoe in the 
gutter and that he realized that if he 

325
00:15:40,761 --> 00:15:41,594
was,
that everything was him and he was 

326
00:15:44,691 --> 00:15:45,524
everything.
And from that moment on he said he felt 

327
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:51,020
safe because he knew that no matter what
he encountered in life,

328
00:15:51,290 --> 00:15:54,020
he was only encountering a version of 
himself.

329
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:57,320
So that's,
that's pretty spiritual stuff.

330
00:15:58,070 --> 00:15:58,551
That's.
Yeah.

331
00:15:58,551 --> 00:16:01,160
I mean you can put it under,
in that box spiritual.

332
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:03,020
Um,
and you could,

333
00:16:03,290 --> 00:16:06,140
you could talk about it from a brain 
science way and say,

334
00:16:06,141 --> 00:16:06,974
okay,
maybe there's things in the brain that 

335
00:16:07,581 --> 00:16:09,650
makes us feel that way or whatever it 
is.

336
00:16:10,250 --> 00:16:11,083
But it is an experience that changes 
your world view and changes how you 

337
00:16:14,391 --> 00:16:17,480
encounter your life and other people,
you know.

338
00:16:17,481 --> 00:16:19,040
And,
and I think that did that for him.

339
00:16:19,460 --> 00:16:21,380
Do you think a lot of his.
Sort of.

340
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:24,800
Because when I think of it,
I think of this sort of anti religion,

341
00:16:25,010 --> 00:16:27,530
the rants that he would go on at the 
church and religion.

342
00:16:27,531 --> 00:16:31,250
And how much of it was just not even 
about religion specifically,

343
00:16:31,251 --> 00:16:35,990
but just about authoritarianism or was 
that really what it was about?

344
00:16:35,991 --> 00:16:37,430
It wasn't about religion.
Well,

345
00:16:37,431 --> 00:16:38,264
I can't say I won't speak for him and I 
don't really know at all what motivated 

346
00:16:41,241 --> 00:16:42,170
him to do those bits.

347
00:16:42,180 --> 00:16:45,470
I never was privy to that part of his 
process.

348
00:16:45,610 --> 00:16:46,443
How he would sit me down during the Hbo 
Taping and let me see it just the way 

349
00:16:49,461 --> 00:16:51,830
everyone else saw it.
I never knew his process,

350
00:16:52,190 --> 00:16:54,020
but sure.
I mean,

351
00:16:54,110 --> 00:16:54,943
I think if you looked at all of his 
material and and sifted through it and 

352
00:16:59,030 --> 00:17:00,850
analyzed it,
I think authoritarian is.

353
00:17:00,851 --> 00:17:05,030
It would be a huge aspect to it all that
anyone out.

354
00:17:05,031 --> 00:17:05,864
I mean he,
my dad never made it through a single 

355
00:17:07,761 --> 00:17:11,150
institution encounter.
He got kicked out of everything.

356
00:17:11,510 --> 00:17:14,030
Elementary School,
junior high,

357
00:17:14,060 --> 00:17:17,090
high school did not finish high school.
Ninth Grade Dropout.

358
00:17:17,390 --> 00:17:21,950
Then joined the air force early,
promoted and demoted.

359
00:17:22,010 --> 00:17:22,843
I got a little piece of paper of his 
that has all the listings of the 

360
00:17:25,491 --> 00:17:28,460
promotions and the emotions that he had 
in the air force.

361
00:17:28,461 --> 00:17:31,490
So he got kicked out of that and then 
ultimately,

362
00:17:31,491 --> 00:17:34,370
you know,
became this straight suit,

363
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:39,400
clean cut comic and even that 
conservative form that he had to be in,

364
00:17:40,581 --> 00:17:43,580
in order to be a successful comedy 
because his dream is to be in the movies

365
00:17:43,581 --> 00:17:46,640
eventually that felt,
you know,

366
00:17:46,641 --> 00:17:47,474
too restrictive and authoritarian for 
him and he rebelled against that to 

367
00:17:50,071 --> 00:17:52,380
ultimately he was always looking.

368
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:54,240
I mean,
he talked about the line.

369
00:17:54,241 --> 00:17:55,220
He always,
you know,

370
00:17:55,350 --> 00:17:58,050
a comics job is to find the line and 
across it.

371
00:17:58,051 --> 00:17:58,884
And I think that's what that's about is 
anyone telling you you can't do 

372
00:18:01,561 --> 00:18:02,940
something.
All right,

373
00:18:02,941 --> 00:18:06,090
let's cross it and really see what we 
can do on the other side of that.

374
00:18:06,420 --> 00:18:07,253
So let's just back up for a second,
because you mentioned that at one time 

375
00:18:09,271 --> 00:18:13,590
your dad was this sort of.
It wasn't conservative comic,

376
00:18:13,591 --> 00:18:15,320
but he was,
he was buttoned down,

377
00:18:15,350 --> 00:18:16,183
get kind of.
He was sort of like everyone else in 

378
00:18:18,830 --> 00:18:20,250
this.
He was that generic,

379
00:18:20,251 --> 00:18:21,084
whatever that were,
but then had a moment that it all 

380
00:18:23,311 --> 00:18:24,630
changed.
Do you,

381
00:18:24,660 --> 00:18:28,150
do you know what it was personally at 
that moment or was it purely like lsd?

382
00:18:28,230 --> 00:18:28,771
It was.
So,

383
00:18:28,771 --> 00:18:29,580
it was the drug.
I mean,

384
00:18:29,580 --> 00:18:32,670
here's the deal on the inside.
He was already the other person.

385
00:18:32,730 --> 00:18:35,310
He had been smoking weed since he was 
14.

386
00:18:35,670 --> 00:18:38,070
His politics were a little more 
conservative growing up.

387
00:18:38,071 --> 00:18:40,300
His mom was a Republican,
as you know,

388
00:18:40,980 --> 00:18:42,860
whatever they call it,
snow,

389
00:18:43,310 --> 00:18:47,190
anything anymore rela relative to fiscal
because what every school.

390
00:18:47,290 --> 00:18:49,130
Conservatives central liberal,
right.

391
00:18:49,140 --> 00:18:50,680
Exactly.
Um,

392
00:18:51,210 --> 00:18:52,043
and when he met Jack Burns,
his first thing was he was a comedy duo 

393
00:18:54,061 --> 00:18:54,894
with Jack Burns.
Jack Burns was left progressive and my 

394
00:18:57,811 --> 00:18:58,644
dad was more moderate guy and Jack took 
him and pulled him and taught him about 

395
00:19:03,390 --> 00:19:05,040
everything.
And then of course Lenny Bruce,

396
00:19:05,340 --> 00:19:06,560
you know,
blew his mind too.

397
00:19:07,410 --> 00:19:11,580
So on the inside,
dad was a radical.

398
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:15,750
He was hanging out with musicians in the
village,

399
00:19:15,780 --> 00:19:16,770
you know,
he was,

400
00:19:16,980 --> 00:19:17,813
he was one of them,
but he had to put on this exterior in 

401
00:19:21,331 --> 00:19:24,660
order to build this career because in 
his mind he really did.

402
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:25,553
He had this Danny k plan and he wanted 
to be like Danny Kaye in the movies and 

403
00:19:28,291 --> 00:19:31,800
he felt the way to do that was tv and 
these night clubs.

404
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:33,780
I mean really,
there were no comedy clubs back then.

405
00:19:34,260 --> 00:19:38,190
You were doing the playboy club with a 
Copa Cabana and you were opening for,

406
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:41,810
you know,
God knows four seasons was.

407
00:19:41,850 --> 00:19:42,683
Yeah,
I mean,

408
00:19:42,900 --> 00:19:43,591
yeah,
he were lucky.

409
00:19:43,591 --> 00:19:44,880
It was a foreseeable bird.
Humperdink.

410
00:19:44,990 --> 00:19:45,823
Yeah.
I mean he opened for the supremes and 

411
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:49,410
Las Vegas and 69,
you know,

412
00:19:49,411 --> 00:19:50,730
it's like the,
you know,

413
00:19:50,731 --> 00:19:51,564
some really think how crazy that is.
Like you can say it and we don't really 

414
00:19:53,731 --> 00:19:55,770
absorb what that means.
But your dad.

415
00:19:55,771 --> 00:19:58,080
Yeah.
Even before his transformation opening.

416
00:19:58,240 --> 00:19:59,130
Yeah.
Supremes.

417
00:19:59,131 --> 00:20:00,650
It seems so bizarre.
Yeah.

418
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:01,553
Yeah.
And that was a,

419
00:20:01,650 --> 00:20:02,483
that was a great gig for him.
He was making a lot of money in that 

420
00:20:04,171 --> 00:20:05,004
Gig.
I think you tell a story where he 

421
00:20:06,031 --> 00:20:08,160
actually got fired from there.
He got fired for that Gig.

422
00:20:08,161 --> 00:20:08,890
Yeah.
Yeah.

423
00:20:08,890 --> 00:20:10,830
He was making more money than he ever 
had made.

424
00:20:10,830 --> 00:20:12,550
And he said the word,
uh,

425
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:14,940
what was it?
His ass in that one or shit,

426
00:20:14,941 --> 00:20:17,870
I think you said Shit that he got fired 
twice in Vegas after shit.

427
00:20:18,090 --> 00:20:21,660
Her Shit and Redd Foxx is down the 
street doing triple x stuff of course.

428
00:20:21,661 --> 00:20:22,410
So,
you know,

429
00:20:22,410 --> 00:20:23,243
but,
but this was the thing he realized he 

430
00:20:25,471 --> 00:20:30,471
was entertaining the parents of the 
people that he was hanging out with and,

431
00:20:32,210 --> 00:20:33,043
and,
and here's like another part of his 

432
00:20:33,991 --> 00:20:38,820
outsider status to was he was 30 in 
1967,

433
00:20:39,390 --> 00:20:44,390
so he was already too old for the 
hippies and all the kids that were going

434
00:20:44,611 --> 00:20:46,890
through that because they were all early
twenties,

435
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:49,840
but he wasn't relating to their parents 
either.

436
00:20:50,140 --> 00:20:53,140
So he was this interesting bridge 
between those two generations,

437
00:20:53,141 --> 00:20:56,170
but related obviously much more to the 
younger generation.

438
00:20:56,290 --> 00:20:57,123
Let's talk a little bit about,
about language because we've been doing 

439
00:21:00,761 --> 00:21:01,594
a ton on political correctness.
Your Dad was not only the most 

440
00:21:04,540 --> 00:21:06,220
unpolitically correct person,
but,

441
00:21:06,221 --> 00:21:08,740
but hated it with a passion.
Yeah,

442
00:21:08,810 --> 00:21:09,643
right.
He really hated it and used words in a 

443
00:21:12,041 --> 00:21:15,640
way to show us how silly we are being 
about things all the time.

444
00:21:15,850 --> 00:21:19,840
And I think right now we're in this very
bizarre place in our country where we're

445
00:21:19,841 --> 00:21:23,050
afraid of certain words were afraid of 
offending people.

446
00:21:23,170 --> 00:21:26,320
You talked about the line before and 
pushing the limits and like jumping over

447
00:21:26,321 --> 00:21:27,154
the line,
what do you think he would make of 

448
00:21:29,710 --> 00:21:31,840
what's going on in this country right 
now with,

449
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:32,950
with words?

450
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:34,600
Well,
I'm talking about that.

451
00:21:34,601 --> 00:21:36,710
I think he would make what he,
what he's always made it.

452
00:21:36,711 --> 00:21:37,544
But I mean,
in the early nineties this was going on 

453
00:21:40,331 --> 00:21:43,710
in colleges too.
I was at Ucla and actually did a,

454
00:21:43,970 --> 00:21:48,100
a forum on political correctness and 
invited my dad to come in and do that.

455
00:21:48,101 --> 00:21:51,940
And um,
that was coming out of the Reagan era,

456
00:21:52,180 --> 00:21:53,740
you know,
so there was a lot of that.

457
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:54,633
But,
but if you really think about it like 

458
00:21:55,361 --> 00:21:56,194
political correctness,
there's something about like polite 

459
00:21:57,491 --> 00:21:58,324
society,
like we're not allowed to talk about 

460
00:22:00,161 --> 00:22:01,390
certain things,
you know,

461
00:22:01,391 --> 00:22:03,670
I think it kind of grows out of that.
But,

462
00:22:03,671 --> 00:22:04,810
you know,
for him,

463
00:22:05,560 --> 00:22:06,393
uh,
he was always bothered by the fact that 

464
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:11,060
it,
it,

465
00:22:11,060 --> 00:22:13,870
it,
it comes from a place of people wanting,

466
00:22:14,790 --> 00:22:17,140
you know,
respect for tolerance,

467
00:22:17,141 --> 00:22:17,980
you know,
of,

468
00:22:18,820 --> 00:22:22,600
of each other and our identities.
So it's sort of well intentioned.

469
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:27,160
It's very well intentioned.
And my dad grew up in Harlem,

470
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:30,430
but he grew up in Harlem,
a Irish,

471
00:22:30,490 --> 00:22:33,220
White Harlem,
right next to black and Spanish Harlem.

472
00:22:33,420 --> 00:22:35,080
Yes,
he would've called it Black Harlem.

473
00:22:35,390 --> 00:22:38,170
And um,
and that doesn't make him race.

474
00:22:38,230 --> 00:22:41,290
It does not make him racist.
And uh,

475
00:22:42,250 --> 00:22:47,170
and so he very much identified with the 
black experience,

476
00:22:47,171 --> 00:22:50,050
the outsider experience and growing up,
uh,

477
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:53,590
the n word was never ever said in our 
house.

478
00:22:53,650 --> 00:22:56,050
And my dad told me it is the one word.
I mean,

479
00:22:56,100 --> 00:23:00,420
I was allowed to say any of the words.
You can say all seven for TV,

480
00:23:01,180 --> 00:23:03,220
but say them in,
in right the right places.

481
00:23:03,221 --> 00:23:05,980
He didn't want me getting in trouble at 
school and other people's houses,

482
00:23:05,981 --> 00:23:08,770
but the n word was one where that was 
Kelly never,

483
00:23:08,771 --> 00:23:09,604
ever,
ever.

484
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:10,713
So he got the whole idea of people 
wanting to define themselves and having 

485
00:23:15,311 --> 00:23:16,240
their own identity.

486
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:17,073
That's a very important thing and it's,
I think it's an important part of 

487
00:23:19,301 --> 00:23:20,134
evolution of our species,
but when you do it by not tolerating 

488
00:23:24,910 --> 00:23:29,380
other speech and suppressing language 
and speech,

489
00:23:30,010 --> 00:23:34,330
I don't think he believed that that was 
not the route to go about this,

490
00:23:34,360 --> 00:23:34,811
that,
you know,

491
00:23:34,811 --> 00:23:39,811
using intolerance to increase tolerance.
It just some to something it just made,

492
00:23:41,140 --> 00:23:43,030
does it fit or something,
you know,

493
00:23:43,990 --> 00:23:44,823
and you know what,
here's the thing about speech and our 

494
00:23:45,981 --> 00:23:46,641
country.
I mean,

495
00:23:46,641 --> 00:23:49,070
if you're,
if anyone's under the first amendment,

496
00:23:49,430 --> 00:23:51,460
it's always that old thing that,
you know,

497
00:23:51,470 --> 00:23:52,303
that thing.
It's always a balance between two 

498
00:23:54,950 --> 00:23:56,060
forces,
you know.

499
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:57,380
And so here we are,
we're,

500
00:23:57,381 --> 00:24:01,460
it's about freedom versus sensitivity.
Both things are important,

501
00:24:01,790 --> 00:24:03,890
really important.
Um,

502
00:24:04,100 --> 00:24:04,933
but uh,
you can't throw the baby out with the 

503
00:24:06,231 --> 00:24:06,921
bathwater,
right?

504
00:24:06,921 --> 00:24:07,754
I,
I would argue that freedom is a little 

505
00:24:08,631 --> 00:24:11,050
more important than sensitivity,
right?

506
00:24:11,180 --> 00:24:12,013
Well,
for you it is for some other people it 

507
00:24:13,221 --> 00:24:13,850
isn't,
you know,

508
00:24:13,850 --> 00:24:16,460
but this is the great thing about a 
democracy is,

509
00:24:16,820 --> 00:24:17,653
and the way we work this stuff out is by
having free speech and a marketplace of 

510
00:24:21,591 --> 00:24:23,450
ideas.
So therefore,

511
00:24:23,451 --> 00:24:26,030
if you're trying to control people's 
speech,

512
00:24:26,060 --> 00:24:26,893
then are you really having a marketplace
of ideas and we're not talking about 

513
00:24:29,721 --> 00:24:30,554
people bullying people and insult comics
and comics who want to hurt feelings or 

514
00:24:36,950 --> 00:24:37,783
you know,
uh,

515
00:24:37,820 --> 00:24:39,710
the whole rape thing that went down.
I mean,

516
00:24:40,250 --> 00:24:43,940
there is obviously we're not talking 
about hate speech,

517
00:24:44,090 --> 00:24:45,740
we're not talking about hate speech.
Exactly.

518
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:47,090
But the thing is my,
you know,

519
00:24:47,091 --> 00:24:51,740
my dad did talk about is that um,
standup comedy is a monologue.

520
00:24:52,760 --> 00:24:56,450
It's not a conversation,
it's an art form that it's a monologue.

521
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:59,540
It was his bully pulpit.
He used to say,

522
00:24:59,541 --> 00:25:00,374
the Adi,
I'm here for me and the audiences here 

523
00:25:02,211 --> 00:25:04,340
for me,
he wasn't here for them.

524
00:25:04,340 --> 00:25:06,440
He's not there to do a seminar.
And he's not.

525
00:25:06,980 --> 00:25:07,813
Even though he was professed sorial,
he was not there to change the world in 

526
00:25:10,941 --> 00:25:11,774
some way.
He was there to get shit off of his 

527
00:25:13,851 --> 00:25:14,684
chest and he did it in a certain way and
so I would love to know his new take on 

528
00:25:19,401 --> 00:25:21,740
all this college stuff and all this 
stuff going down,

529
00:25:21,980 --> 00:25:22,813
but I think it would be built on a lot 
of this stuff right now with this whole 

530
00:25:25,041 --> 00:25:25,874
thing we have on college campuses with 
social justice warriors and safe rooms 

531
00:25:29,181 --> 00:25:31,340
and trigger warnings.
Things we've talked about.

532
00:25:31,490 --> 00:25:32,323
You wrote an interesting piece about 
this on your facebook page that was 

533
00:25:34,641 --> 00:25:35,474
related to comedy and all of this and a 
little bit it was sort of about your 

534
00:25:38,331 --> 00:25:39,164
dad,
but we jumped off because of Jerry 

535
00:25:40,191 --> 00:25:41,370
seinfeld making a comment.
Yeah.

536
00:25:41,380 --> 00:25:44,150
And Todd and todd glass had written a,
a,

537
00:25:44,250 --> 00:25:46,910
a reply to a piece in the La Times and 
he felt,

538
00:25:46,940 --> 00:25:48,440
you know,
he was kind of on the other side of it,

539
00:25:48,441 --> 00:25:53,441
of respecting people's rights to define 
themselves more and you know,

540
00:25:53,691 --> 00:25:55,130
and I just,
I just kind of.

541
00:25:55,280 --> 00:25:56,530
I'd finally,
after I think,

542
00:25:56,560 --> 00:25:57,393
you know,
about a year and a half or two years of 

543
00:25:57,951 --> 00:26:01,340
trying to think about all this had 
pulled all my thoughts together and,

544
00:26:01,480 --> 00:26:01,960
and,
and,

545
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:05,240
and some of it I've already shared here,
but the whole trigger warning thing,

546
00:26:05,241 --> 00:26:10,241
I mean I really would have loved my dad 
to unpack the,

547
00:26:10,760 --> 00:26:11,593
just the phrase trigger just to help us 
unpack it a little bit and I can only 

548
00:26:19,221 --> 00:26:20,054
imagine who he would have pissed off 
with that I'm sure it would have been 

549
00:26:23,481 --> 00:26:26,350
the feminists and my dad was a 
considered himself a feminist.

550
00:26:26,510 --> 00:26:27,343
I mean,
you know,

551
00:26:28,040 --> 00:26:28,940
that was the irony,
right?

552
00:26:28,941 --> 00:26:31,010
So something like that,
he would have pissed off the feminists,

553
00:26:31,011 --> 00:26:33,060
but he was very pro woman actually.
Yeah.

554
00:26:33,140 --> 00:26:35,390
He did.
Was To empower women who've never.

555
00:26:35,391 --> 00:26:36,880
He would really talk about something.
Yeah.

556
00:26:36,890 --> 00:26:40,250
His humor for the most part I would say 
is very pro woman.

557
00:26:40,280 --> 00:26:41,960
And um,
but I mean,

558
00:26:41,961 --> 00:26:44,580
even when he talked about using the term
rape,

559
00:26:44,610 --> 00:26:47,400
you know,
and it can rape ever be funny.

560
00:26:47,401 --> 00:26:50,040
And then he tells this joke about,
you know,

561
00:26:50,160 --> 00:26:50,993
uh,
donald or daffy duck fucking elmer fudd 

562
00:26:53,011 --> 00:26:54,580
or something.
It's funny,

563
00:26:55,040 --> 00:26:57,000
it's a great image.
You can't help but laugh.

564
00:26:57,450 --> 00:27:00,270
So that's gay duck rape.
I'm sorry.

565
00:27:00,271 --> 00:27:02,140
That's pretty funny.
Now I've got the vegans.

566
00:27:02,600 --> 00:27:04,610
Oh Man.
And the game.

567
00:27:05,220 --> 00:27:07,610
Alright,
please trigger warning on that.

568
00:27:07,790 --> 00:27:09,030
That joke right there please.
Yeah.

569
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:10,320
Uh,
so yeah,

570
00:27:10,321 --> 00:27:11,940
I would.
Yeah,

571
00:27:11,941 --> 00:27:12,960
I,
I,

572
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:13,980
yeah,
I,

573
00:27:13,980 --> 00:27:15,780
I do like you,
I miss him too.

574
00:27:15,781 --> 00:27:17,880
There are certain things that come up 
where I,

575
00:27:18,210 --> 00:27:19,000
where I do.
I'm like,

576
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:21,060
I wish dad was here and then I'm like,
okay,

577
00:27:21,061 --> 00:27:24,240
so we're going to have to figure this 
out on my own or on her own like without

578
00:27:24,241 --> 00:27:26,190
dad how to walk through this,
you know,

579
00:27:26,191 --> 00:27:30,060
and there's some comics out there who I 
think definitely helped with this.

580
00:27:30,060 --> 00:27:32,130
Absolutely.
The work is helping.

581
00:27:32,140 --> 00:27:34,080
I was going to ask you that a little 
closer to the end,

582
00:27:34,081 --> 00:27:37,640
but as long as I think Bill Maher is,
I think Lewis Black is a,

583
00:27:37,650 --> 00:27:40,350
I think Louis Ck is doing brilliant 
work.

584
00:27:40,351 --> 00:27:43,980
I think Amy Schumer is doing great work.
I'm Nora Dunn.

585
00:27:43,981 --> 00:27:48,830
Just went after her today and uh,
because she's talking about using,

586
00:27:49,080 --> 00:27:52,620
naming her body parts,
using nasty words to name her body parts

587
00:27:52,621 --> 00:27:53,454
and she thinks it's self shaming.
So that's gonna be an interesting 

588
00:27:55,561 --> 00:27:58,350
conversation between the feminists.
What's going on with that?

589
00:27:58,760 --> 00:28:00,360
Um,
and,

590
00:28:00,361 --> 00:28:00,901
you know,
and I,

591
00:28:00,901 --> 00:28:04,740
and there's a ton of younger comics too 
that are doing great work.

592
00:28:04,760 --> 00:28:09,440
Um,
and not that Amy Schumer isn't 1:30

593
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:10,680
or so young,
but,

594
00:28:11,240 --> 00:28:12,090
uh,
but yeah,

595
00:28:12,091 --> 00:28:13,500
I mean there's,
there's,

596
00:28:13,620 --> 00:28:15,630
there's good work going on at there.
Chris Rock,

597
00:28:15,660 --> 00:28:17,490
you know,
always does great work.

598
00:28:17,910 --> 00:28:19,290
So,
um,

599
00:28:19,470 --> 00:28:20,910
you know,
they're out there pushing,

600
00:28:20,940 --> 00:28:22,710
pushing,
pushing the edge,

601
00:28:22,790 --> 00:28:24,480
but the line,
they should be.

602
00:28:24,560 --> 00:28:25,393
So last thought on the,
on the free speech and the political 

603
00:28:27,030 --> 00:28:28,330
correctness stuff,
uh,

604
00:28:28,370 --> 00:28:29,203
is,
is this where we could really teach 

605
00:28:31,650 --> 00:28:35,300
younger people.
And I hate to say that as if.

606
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:37,920
I mean,
if there's an arrogance in that too.

607
00:28:37,921 --> 00:28:38,754
I mean,
I think generations come up and they've 

608
00:28:40,020 --> 00:28:42,960
got their own worldview.
They've got their own life experience.

609
00:28:42,961 --> 00:28:45,890
They're trying to define themselves.
Um,

610
00:28:46,410 --> 00:28:47,243
but yes,
I think they weren't around for the 

611
00:28:49,891 --> 00:28:50,724
fights.
They weren't around for Lenny Bruce 

612
00:28:52,140 --> 00:28:52,973
Getting arrested.
They weren't around for my dad getting 

613
00:28:54,511 --> 00:28:57,360
arrested.
They don't understand the luxury.

614
00:28:57,361 --> 00:29:02,361
They have a around free speech and um,
this regressive left.

615
00:29:04,231 --> 00:29:05,700
I guess that's what we're calling them 
now.

616
00:29:05,701 --> 00:29:06,980
I had,
I saw one of your path,

617
00:29:06,981 --> 00:29:08,630
what I'm calling.
I had to look it up.

618
00:29:08,631 --> 00:29:10,260
I'm like,
what exactly does he mean by that?

619
00:29:10,530 --> 00:29:11,970
Now I got it.
I understand it.

620
00:29:12,450 --> 00:29:13,283
And it's these people that would be 
attacking your dad with the kids and 

621
00:29:16,310 --> 00:29:18,840
it's,
there's an authoritarianism around it.

622
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:23,700
There's a need to control everything in 
order for the world to be comfortable.

623
00:29:23,910 --> 00:29:25,230
And Hey,
you know what,

624
00:29:25,380 --> 00:29:26,213
I get it.
That generation is facing a planet 

625
00:29:28,801 --> 00:29:30,660
that's dying,
uh,

626
00:29:31,020 --> 00:29:36,020
an economy that doesn't look very good.
Politics that have stopped working,

627
00:29:36,031 --> 00:29:38,790
our democracy has stopped working.
Um,

628
00:29:38,970 --> 00:29:42,730
I too would want to control things.
And so maybe if you can control people's

629
00:29:42,731 --> 00:29:45,670
language and create a sense of safety,
I mean,

630
00:29:45,671 --> 00:29:48,190
maybe that's what this is about on a 
psychological level.

631
00:29:48,220 --> 00:29:49,870
I don't know.
Um,

632
00:29:49,871 --> 00:29:50,681
I,
I get it,

633
00:29:50,681 --> 00:29:51,514
but yeah,
I think it is our job to at least bring 

634
00:29:54,971 --> 00:29:55,804
some history up and educate them about 
the fights we've had in this country to 

635
00:30:00,551 --> 00:30:01,384
end to understand what the purpose of 
free speeches and it's not like enter 

636
00:30:04,990 --> 00:30:07,090
government is no longer censoring.
Yes.

637
00:30:07,180 --> 00:30:08,013
This is the,
it's now corporate America and these 

638
00:30:09,611 --> 00:30:11,530
interest groups,
you know.

639
00:30:11,590 --> 00:30:12,423
So did you ever think or or someone.
So your father literally arrested by 

640
00:30:15,620 --> 00:30:20,110
because of exercising his free speech.
This is someone who last gigs because of

641
00:30:20,111 --> 00:30:24,730
using pretty mundane curse words.
Do you think he could have ever imagined

642
00:30:25,210 --> 00:30:26,590
if you would agree with what you just 
said,

643
00:30:26,591 --> 00:30:28,750
that you would fear the lack of free 
speech?

644
00:30:28,751 --> 00:30:30,400
Not because the government is coming 
down,

645
00:30:30,430 --> 00:30:32,530
which is so funny.
We're doing it to ourselves.

646
00:30:32,920 --> 00:30:34,360
Do you think he could have ever 
envisioned,

647
00:30:34,420 --> 00:30:35,253
envisioned?
He had a lot to say about business and 

648
00:30:37,930 --> 00:30:40,210
corporations.
I mean he really hated all of them.

649
00:30:40,211 --> 00:30:41,044
They are the,
they are the owners of this country and 

650
00:30:42,641 --> 00:30:46,810
have been ever since the industrial age 
began.

651
00:30:47,300 --> 00:30:50,800
What was that bit and his last Hbo 
Special About The true owners?

652
00:30:51,100 --> 00:30:53,380
I don't think so.
I think it was the second to last one.

653
00:30:53,620 --> 00:30:54,670
Yeah.
Yeah.

654
00:30:55,050 --> 00:30:56,620
Um,
but yeah,

655
00:30:56,621 --> 00:30:58,660
I mean he would have a lot to say about 
that and he,

656
00:30:58,661 --> 00:30:59,830
I mean,
it's not like,

657
00:30:59,850 --> 00:31:03,130
you know,
10 years ago corporations weren't trying

658
00:31:03,131 --> 00:31:06,310
to shave him at advertising dollars,
shape everything on television.

659
00:31:06,310 --> 00:31:07,450
I mean,
now with the Internet,

660
00:31:08,020 --> 00:31:10,390
it's interesting because we have a lot 
more freedom,

661
00:31:10,391 --> 00:31:11,010
you know,
and,

662
00:31:11,010 --> 00:31:11,440
and,
uh,

663
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:12,273
you know,
and I look at like the bigger picture 

664
00:31:12,911 --> 00:31:13,744
of,
and you think of like the expansion of 

665
00:31:14,621 --> 00:31:16,480
the freedom that the Internet has given 
us.

666
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:17,553
So it's not strange that some other part
of our culture wants to shut something 

667
00:31:21,251 --> 00:31:21,881
down.
You know,

668
00:31:21,881 --> 00:31:22,714
there's this,
there is a balance like this all the 

669
00:31:26,591 --> 00:31:27,280
time,
you know,

670
00:31:27,280 --> 00:31:30,280
whether it's in our own individual 
psyches are the collective psyche.

671
00:31:30,281 --> 00:31:33,340
So it's fascinating.
And ultimately,

672
00:31:33,341 --> 00:31:35,260
you know what I tell people when people 
say,

673
00:31:35,290 --> 00:31:36,550
Oh,
your dad,

674
00:31:36,551 --> 00:31:38,230
I wish you know.
And I'm like,

675
00:31:38,231 --> 00:31:39,160
yes,
I get it.

676
00:31:39,700 --> 00:31:41,290
And then I'm going to try not to say to 
you,

677
00:31:41,291 --> 00:31:42,910
yeah,
but it's true and I.

678
00:31:42,930 --> 00:31:43,900
But I remind people,
I say,

679
00:31:43,901 --> 00:31:44,770
look,
no matter what,

680
00:31:44,771 --> 00:31:48,100
we can remember this dad said,
when you're born,

681
00:31:48,520 --> 00:31:52,090
you get a ticket to the freak show and 
when you're born in America,

682
00:31:52,300 --> 00:31:53,890
you get a front row seat.

683
00:31:54,310 --> 00:31:55,143
So we're at the freak show and then he 
added later on another thing which I 

684
00:31:58,931 --> 00:31:59,561
love,
which is,

685
00:31:59,561 --> 00:32:03,400
and some of us get to sit on the side 
and take notes and talk about it,

686
00:32:03,640 --> 00:32:05,740
which is what we get to do.
So,

687
00:32:05,741 --> 00:32:07,690
you know,
which is a really privileged position to

688
00:32:07,691 --> 00:32:08,870
be in.
Um,

689
00:32:08,910 --> 00:32:09,743
but now everyone gets that privileged 
position because it's the internet and 

690
00:32:11,501 --> 00:32:13,130
there's comments sector going on,
right?

691
00:32:13,140 --> 00:32:15,730
Twitter,
they're pretty good to me.

692
00:32:15,740 --> 00:32:18,040
They're the people watching this.
Me Too.

693
00:32:18,430 --> 00:32:22,210
We've cultivated something nice here.
So the political situation we have going

694
00:32:22,211 --> 00:32:23,044
on this,
this pathetic really pathetic group of 

695
00:32:26,531 --> 00:32:28,390
candidates are pretty much on all 
fronts,

696
00:32:28,750 --> 00:32:31,120
in my opinion,
with Bernie being the one exception.

697
00:32:31,150 --> 00:32:32,380
I agree.
Um,

698
00:32:32,540 --> 00:32:33,373
what,
what do you think he would make of this 

699
00:32:34,271 --> 00:32:34,790
now?
He did.

700
00:32:34,790 --> 00:32:35,623
He,
he,

701
00:32:35,710 --> 00:32:40,220
he obviously was socially liberal,
but he didn't identify as a Democrat,

702
00:32:40,221 --> 00:32:41,054
did he?

703
00:32:41,060 --> 00:32:43,040
He didn't vote,
but he didn't vote at all,

704
00:32:43,050 --> 00:32:46,160
but he was very progressive.
He always chose people over property.

705
00:32:46,610 --> 00:32:47,710
So,
uh,

706
00:32:47,720 --> 00:32:50,120
whatever candidate chose people over 
property,

707
00:32:50,150 --> 00:32:51,880
he would lean towards that.
Uh,

708
00:32:51,920 --> 00:32:56,390
before he died,
he was happy about Hillary back in 2008.

709
00:32:56,420 --> 00:32:57,253
That was,
he was not around for the big Obama 

710
00:32:59,201 --> 00:33:02,840
surge and I know he would have been 
thrilled to have seen a black president.

711
00:33:02,841 --> 00:33:04,640
I know he would have really been 
thrilled about that.

712
00:33:04,641 --> 00:33:05,474
And I got to be in Washington and 
November picking up his Mark Twain 

713
00:33:09,650 --> 00:33:11,390
Prize.
When Obama flew over,

714
00:33:11,391 --> 00:33:12,224
my husband and I were on the steps of 
the Lincoln memorial and Obama was flew 

715
00:33:15,531 --> 00:33:16,364
over in the helicopter to go visit 
George Bush in the White House for the 

716
00:33:18,351 --> 00:33:20,030
first time.
And all I could think about is,

717
00:33:20,031 --> 00:33:23,510
I wish my dad was here right now.
He would have brought a tear to his eye.

718
00:33:23,510 --> 00:33:24,343
Absolutely.
It was a very sentimental man in that 

719
00:33:25,461 --> 00:33:26,420
way.
But,

720
00:33:26,421 --> 00:33:27,800
um,
but yeah,

721
00:33:27,801 --> 00:33:32,030
but,
and he saw it all as bullshit as he said

722
00:33:32,031 --> 00:33:34,430
all the time.
He really had a detachment to it.

723
00:33:34,431 --> 00:33:35,264
He didn't vote.
He hadn't voted since mcgovern lost in 

724
00:33:37,321 --> 00:33:38,154
[inaudible] 72.
I think that's when his heart really 

725
00:33:39,231 --> 00:33:40,190
broke.
Um,

726
00:33:41,270 --> 00:33:44,210
and yeah,
I struggle with that internally,

727
00:33:44,280 --> 00:33:47,110
that he wasn't voting yet.
He was talking so much about this,

728
00:33:47,710 --> 00:33:50,920
but he also felt the system was so 
broken almost that it was he would it be

729
00:33:50,921 --> 00:33:54,530
on repairs.
Logic was that you,

730
00:33:54,560 --> 00:33:55,393
if you vote,
you don't have the right to complain if 

731
00:33:58,171 --> 00:33:58,540
you

732
00:33:58,540 --> 00:33:59,373
both.

733
00:34:00,370 --> 00:34:01,203
Oh,
that's talk about flipping something on 

734
00:34:01,881 --> 00:34:04,640
a test because then you're part of the 
problem.

735
00:34:04,641 --> 00:34:05,900
Yes,
completely.

736
00:34:06,230 --> 00:34:08,390
That was his thing and he would,
he'd said that a few times.

737
00:34:08,410 --> 00:34:11,690
It was like,
uh,

738
00:34:13,090 --> 00:34:14,750
but uh,
that was his stance.

739
00:34:15,140 --> 00:34:15,973
So,
and that's where he stood with that and 

740
00:34:17,301 --> 00:34:18,200
you know,
he really did.

741
00:34:18,201 --> 00:34:20,480
He was able to compartmentalize and 
detach,

742
00:34:20,780 --> 00:34:21,980
like I said,
at home,

743
00:34:22,070 --> 00:34:23,630
rooting for Hillary,
happy that,

744
00:34:23,631 --> 00:34:24,430
you know,
that she was,

745
00:34:24,430 --> 00:34:25,850
you know,
shaking things up,

746
00:34:26,300 --> 00:34:29,930
but on stage he didn't need,
would never talk about,

747
00:34:30,020 --> 00:34:31,820
you know,
one way or the other.

748
00:34:31,821 --> 00:34:33,680
I mean like Lewis Black,
you know,

749
00:34:33,681 --> 00:34:35,960
his politics,
you know who he's voting for.

750
00:34:36,260 --> 00:34:37,610
Bill Maher,
he gives money,

751
00:34:37,611 --> 00:34:40,910
like he's tried to get money to burn 
money to Bernie on Friday.

752
00:34:40,911 --> 00:34:42,250
He's like,
I want to give you money.

753
00:34:42,430 --> 00:34:46,100
I can only give you $5,400.
You're not taking any super PAC money,

754
00:34:46,101 --> 00:34:46,934
you know,
you have a pre,

755
00:34:46,990 --> 00:34:48,290
you give him another million dollars.

756
00:34:48,310 --> 00:34:49,143
I mean,
Bill Maher literally gave and Obama 

757
00:34:50,751 --> 00:34:51,584
super a million dollars budget and it 
was sort of brilliant what he said 

758
00:34:53,901 --> 00:34:55,220
because he was like,
he's like,

759
00:34:55,221 --> 00:34:56,990
I know this sounds like I'm doing this 
for Obama,

760
00:34:57,020 --> 00:34:57,853
but I'm doing this for me because I 
don't want the other guy to become 

761
00:34:59,700 --> 00:35:00,533
right.
And that's what he was saying Friday 

762
00:35:01,251 --> 00:35:01,941
night too.
I was like,

763
00:35:01,941 --> 00:35:02,900
you know,
if you don't like the fish,

764
00:35:02,901 --> 00:35:05,060
eat the chicken people.
What do you think as a comic,

765
00:35:05,061 --> 00:35:07,610
there's a risk in that because then 
you've shown your cards too much in that

766
00:35:07,611 --> 00:35:11,870
what your dad did and in a way by,
by holding a little closer.

767
00:35:11,990 --> 00:35:14,330
I think every comic has their own 
approach.

768
00:35:14,360 --> 00:35:15,193
It's,
it's as you know that we're all 

769
00:35:16,521 --> 00:35:17,420
snowflakes.

770
00:35:17,580 --> 00:35:18,413
Yeah.

771
00:35:20,170 --> 00:35:21,003
Yeah.
Everyone's got their own approach to it 

772
00:35:23,321 --> 00:35:26,050
in their own way.
My Dad liked being,

773
00:35:26,110 --> 00:35:28,540
not part of it all.
He liked not being,

774
00:35:28,630 --> 00:35:31,270
having no stake in it,
uh,

775
00:35:31,271 --> 00:35:33,310
so that he could emotionally detached 
from it.

776
00:35:33,311 --> 00:35:37,520
I think that's how he personally 
protected himself from all of it to um,

777
00:35:37,770 --> 00:35:40,240
I personally don't think that's a 
healthy way to go through life.

778
00:35:40,241 --> 00:35:42,700
I love my dad dearly.
I,

779
00:35:42,910 --> 00:35:43,920
you know,
my dad was like,

780
00:35:43,921 --> 00:35:44,754
I gave about the species I gave up on 
the planet and I was in my late 

781
00:35:47,851 --> 00:35:48,684
thirties,
early forties at the time and I was 

782
00:35:49,471 --> 00:35:50,730
like,
well gee,

783
00:35:50,731 --> 00:35:53,100
I hope to have 30 to 40 more years on 
the planet.

784
00:35:53,160 --> 00:35:58,050
I'm still kind of involved in the 
species a little more and I get the,

785
00:35:58,051 --> 00:35:59,970
you know,
evolution is slow,

786
00:35:59,971 --> 00:36:02,340
but I do believe in the evolution of 
consciousness,

787
00:36:02,341 --> 00:36:04,440
you know,
so I try to do my little part.

788
00:36:05,010 --> 00:36:06,990
My Dad,
he was never an activist.

789
00:36:06,991 --> 00:36:07,824
He was never on the front lines,
even in the Vietnam War and all that 

790
00:36:10,441 --> 00:36:12,150
kind of stuff.
Meaning had opinions about it,

791
00:36:12,151 --> 00:36:16,920
but he's not a man who got involved.
He onstage did his act,

792
00:36:16,950 --> 00:36:17,783
you know,
activism and there's probably something 

793
00:36:19,111 --> 00:36:21,150
to be said for that,
that we all in life,

794
00:36:21,151 --> 00:36:21,984
and I'm not just talking about comics,
but everybody sort of picks very little 

795
00:36:24,451 --> 00:36:25,284
role about how they're going to go out 
and some people are gonna have kids and 

796
00:36:29,371 --> 00:36:30,204
try to teach them the right thing and 
people like your dad will have one 

797
00:36:32,491 --> 00:36:33,300
child,
but then,

798
00:36:33,300 --> 00:36:36,540
but then teach a generation.
Although he claimed he never.

799
00:36:37,110 --> 00:36:40,550
Although it's not about changing minds,
you know,

800
00:36:40,640 --> 00:36:41,220
uh,
you know,

801
00:36:41,220 --> 00:36:43,620
when I used to say please,
really bullshit dad,

802
00:36:43,650 --> 00:36:44,340
like,
come on.

803
00:36:44,340 --> 00:36:45,090
Oh,
he changed me.

804
00:36:45,090 --> 00:36:46,410
He was surreal.
I mean,

805
00:36:46,411 --> 00:36:47,010
that's what he did.

806
00:36:47,010 --> 00:36:47,461
He,
he,

807
00:36:47,461 --> 00:36:49,260
you know,
he had a big stick and he'd come out and

808
00:36:49,261 --> 00:36:50,460
whack us all with it and go,
oh,

809
00:36:50,461 --> 00:36:51,271
we'd all go,
oh shit.

810
00:36:51,271 --> 00:36:51,880
You're right.
Oh,

811
00:36:51,880 --> 00:36:52,713
that's right.
That's the beauty of it is that I agree 

812
00:36:55,081 --> 00:36:56,820
ultimately the beauty of comedy more 
than anything else,

813
00:36:56,821 --> 00:36:57,654
that when I would watch those specials 
from literally from being 12 years old 

814
00:37:00,750 --> 00:37:03,630
to being 35,
that I would watch them and go,

815
00:37:03,720 --> 00:37:05,460
God,
this is the truth,

816
00:37:06,210 --> 00:37:07,043
is the truth.
And I don't know how any other comic 

817
00:37:09,511 --> 00:37:11,730
where it,
I mean even as his daughter,

818
00:37:12,360 --> 00:37:16,200
I would feel changed in some way by each
of his shows.

819
00:37:16,230 --> 00:37:20,700
There was something in me,
some idea I had about the world had been

820
00:37:20,701 --> 00:37:21,534
stretched in a new way.
Not always a comfortably uncomfortable 

821
00:37:25,710 --> 00:37:27,870
way,
but something had been like,

822
00:37:27,960 --> 00:37:28,793
oh,
a little mind expansion had gone on and 

823
00:37:32,670 --> 00:37:37,140
I don't know if there are other comics 
who do that.

824
00:37:37,140 --> 00:37:39,960
I mean,
I'm entertained by a lot of them.

825
00:37:40,270 --> 00:37:41,103
Um,
it does seem that something in comedy 

826
00:37:43,021 --> 00:37:46,860
has changed where counterculture doesn't
seem to be very cool anymore.

827
00:37:46,861 --> 00:37:47,694
Your Dad,
part of the coolest was he was 

828
00:37:48,890 --> 00:37:49,723
counterculture.
And right now if you were counter 

829
00:37:51,471 --> 00:37:52,304
culture,
it really means you're sort of against 

830
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:55,080
your,
against administration.

831
00:37:55,081 --> 00:37:55,914
So you're somehow you were against Obama
I think maybe because of all this 

832
00:37:59,220 --> 00:38:03,090
political correctness stuff,
there's a sense that that's not cool.

833
00:38:03,091 --> 00:38:06,390
So it sort of like the death of.
I don't know,

834
00:38:06,450 --> 00:38:08,690
I think there's still a lot of 
independence in that.

835
00:38:09,080 --> 00:38:13,170
Comics have to always are always the 
outsider no matter what.

836
00:38:13,171 --> 00:38:14,004
I mean,
even if they vote and they give a 

837
00:38:15,060 --> 00:38:15,893
million dollars,
Bill Maher is still going to give Obama 

838
00:38:16,890 --> 00:38:17,970
Shit for shit.
I mean,

839
00:38:17,971 --> 00:38:19,950
he's still got his positions,
you know,

840
00:38:19,951 --> 00:38:20,784
and Louis black to given Bernie Shit.
Bill Maher the other day as he was 

841
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:25,410
saying I support.

842
00:38:25,410 --> 00:38:26,101
Yeah.
You know,

843
00:38:26,101 --> 00:38:29,320
and I think that really is the 
independent thinking and spirit of,

844
00:38:29,340 --> 00:38:31,650
of comedy.
So I think that is,

845
00:38:31,890 --> 00:38:33,540
I really do think that's alive and well.
I mean,

846
00:38:33,541 --> 00:38:34,050
I,
you know,

847
00:38:34,050 --> 00:38:34,883
I spoke about Amy Schumer earlier when I
first saw amy Schumer three or four 

848
00:38:38,201 --> 00:38:39,034
years ago,
she was on the Roseanne Roast and I 

849
00:38:40,361 --> 00:38:41,680
thought,
Oh really?

850
00:38:41,681 --> 00:38:42,820
Dick Jokes girl,
like,

851
00:38:42,821 --> 00:38:44,020
you know,
we fought so hard,

852
00:38:44,021 --> 00:38:45,280
you know,
and you're telling Dick Jokes.

853
00:38:45,730 --> 00:38:46,930
I didn't get it.
I didn't get.

854
00:38:46,931 --> 00:38:47,764
She was playing a persona that she's 
kind of pushing up against all of this 

855
00:38:50,801 --> 00:38:53,530
stuff and she's doing it in her own way 
too.

856
00:38:53,531 --> 00:38:57,230
She's counterculture in some way because
she is taking her.

857
00:38:57,340 --> 00:38:58,520
She's really,
she's,

858
00:38:58,660 --> 00:38:59,493
she's a,
she's a huge feminist and yet she's 

859
00:39:01,091 --> 00:39:03,290
taking some of it to task at the same 
time.

860
00:39:03,291 --> 00:39:04,840
And,
and I like that.

861
00:39:04,841 --> 00:39:06,630
She makes us a little uncomfortable 
around that

862
00:39:06,670 --> 00:39:07,440
stuff.
Well,

863
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:09,900
we could talk about your dad and all 
this stuff forever,

864
00:39:09,901 --> 00:39:13,730
but I want to shift a little bit to sort
of how we know each other past couple of

865
00:39:13,731 --> 00:39:14,564
years and,
and some of the things that we talk 

866
00:39:15,811 --> 00:39:18,080
about all the time and you know,
you.

867
00:39:18,110 --> 00:39:18,943
So you have these parties every couple 
of weeks at your house where you bring 

868
00:39:21,331 --> 00:39:22,164
basically what I would describe as sort 
of the wackiest mix of comedians and 

869
00:39:27,510 --> 00:39:32,190
actors and writers and philosophers and 
who,

870
00:39:32,310 --> 00:39:34,670
what other professions are there behind 
the camera.

871
00:39:34,671 --> 00:39:35,570
People,
musicians,

872
00:39:36,180 --> 00:39:37,013
this wild crew of people.
And it's always changing and coming and 

873
00:39:39,631 --> 00:39:40,490
going,
uh,

874
00:39:40,510 --> 00:39:41,343
and you call the poly mine.
And so I first want you to explain what 

875
00:39:44,540 --> 00:39:45,373
it means to you.
But the reason I love it so much in it 

876
00:39:47,220 --> 00:39:50,790
because it's so become part of how I've 
treated this show,

877
00:39:50,791 --> 00:39:55,140
that I want my audience to be part of 
what we're talking about.

878
00:39:55,141 --> 00:39:57,980
I want it to be a conversation.
So now explain what,

879
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:01,230
what the poly mind is and most of the 
people that you've had at your parties.

880
00:40:01,231 --> 00:40:02,064
By the way,
I've had on previous incarnations my 

881
00:40:03,330 --> 00:40:04,290
show.
I bet you,

882
00:40:04,291 --> 00:40:06,510
I mean,
you really like opened up like a zillion

883
00:40:06,511 --> 00:40:08,460
friends to me in the comedy community,
all that

884
00:40:08,970 --> 00:40:09,781
part of the.
I mean,

885
00:40:09,781 --> 00:40:10,614
I love community.
I think being an only child I was a 

886
00:40:12,671 --> 00:40:13,380
little.
I was,

887
00:40:13,380 --> 00:40:15,270
I was a loner,
a bit lonely.

888
00:40:15,570 --> 00:40:16,403
So community's always been important to 
me and especially in the last 20 years 

889
00:40:19,891 --> 00:40:22,250
I've really felt that.
And um,

890
00:40:22,970 --> 00:40:23,803
and,
and part of what happened and how this 

891
00:40:25,020 --> 00:40:28,800
came to be was when my dad died,
I became part of the comedy community,

892
00:40:28,830 --> 00:40:29,663
which I was not a part of before and met
Paul prevents and Paul Provenza knows 

893
00:40:32,731 --> 00:40:33,564
everybody and he is part of that.
Like he and him and my world kind of 

894
00:40:37,981 --> 00:40:42,210
merged in this thing called the what I 
call the poly mine commune emerged.

895
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:44,400
And for me,
the poly mind is,

896
00:40:44,460 --> 00:40:47,280
comes from my,
my roots of studying,

897
00:40:47,340 --> 00:40:49,770
uh,
Carl Jung's psychology,

898
00:40:49,980 --> 00:40:50,813
uh,
the collective unconscious that we have 

899
00:40:52,771 --> 00:40:57,300
all these archetypes inside of us.
We have all these voices in our head and

900
00:40:57,301 --> 00:41:00,330
they all have a right to have a voice,
you know,

901
00:41:00,331 --> 00:41:04,980
from the most staunch conservative voice
in our head to the most liberal voice,

902
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:06,200
uh,
to,

903
00:41:06,220 --> 00:41:08,100
to the most immature,
to the most mature.

904
00:41:08,110 --> 00:41:08,943
We all,
everything gets a voice and gets a seat 

905
00:41:11,431 --> 00:41:15,060
at the table at some point because every
voice ultimately is important.

906
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:16,091
Wait,
so let me get this clear.

907
00:41:16,091 --> 00:41:16,924
We're not supposed to shout down the 
voices we don't like and we're not 

908
00:41:18,881 --> 00:41:21,740
supposed to call them bigots and racists
and homophobic and sexist.

909
00:41:21,770 --> 00:41:22,160
Yeah.

910
00:41:22,160 --> 00:41:23,970
Yeah.
And I think the way,

911
00:41:23,971 --> 00:41:27,480
the reason we do that in public is 
because we have such intolerance for the

912
00:41:27,481 --> 00:41:29,310
voices inside of our heads.
Also,

913
00:41:29,580 --> 00:41:31,500
I think what his enter his outer.
I mean,

914
00:41:31,501 --> 00:41:33,710
that's part of what I do.
So part of.

915
00:41:33,711 --> 00:41:34,544
I just love that word.
And so I just came up with this word 

916
00:41:36,021 --> 00:41:40,680
poly mind because I really feel like we 
all are individually a polyman,

917
00:41:40,700 --> 00:41:41,533
but community in itself is a polyamide 
that we each have our own perspectives 

918
00:41:45,351 --> 00:41:49,100
and their own way of seeing it in and we
can agree on 10 things.

919
00:41:49,101 --> 00:41:51,230
And then there's four things that we 
totally disagree on it.

920
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:54,620
And that's okay.
We love each other.

921
00:41:55,170 --> 00:41:57,810
Imagine a read on everything.
It will be terrible.

922
00:41:57,830 --> 00:42:01,640
It would be boring and there there's no 
learning and expanding and there's no,

923
00:42:01,641 --> 00:42:02,474
you know,
there's,

924
00:42:02,610 --> 00:42:05,210
there's no juice in life at all then,
you know.

925
00:42:05,480 --> 00:42:06,460
So yeah.
So this,

926
00:42:06,670 --> 00:42:07,520
so I just,
you know,

927
00:42:07,521 --> 00:42:10,220
playfully call it the poly mine commune,
you know,

928
00:42:10,240 --> 00:42:13,070
because ultimately I'm a Hippie,
you know,

929
00:42:13,340 --> 00:42:18,200
the blues and the weed helps of course 
it does test and,

930
00:42:18,260 --> 00:42:21,500
but really it's become um,
what I love,

931
00:42:21,501 --> 00:42:23,900
what happens in these things is that,
like you said,

932
00:42:24,230 --> 00:42:29,180
this cross pollination happens.
And my favorite thing which happens when

933
00:42:29,210 --> 00:42:29,961
I,
you know,

934
00:42:29,961 --> 00:42:31,440
I haven't had a lot of big parties 
lately.

935
00:42:31,450 --> 00:42:34,340
I used to have a lot of big parties,
but in the big parties,

936
00:42:34,370 --> 00:42:35,203
maybe 60 people will be at my house and 
it always happens that two people will 

937
00:42:39,801 --> 00:42:44,801
encounter each other in my kitchen who 
have not seen each other in 15 years who

938
00:42:44,871 --> 00:42:47,990
grew up together.
I was something crazy like that.

939
00:42:48,230 --> 00:42:50,260
And there's this re,
uh,

940
00:42:50,270 --> 00:42:51,103
you know,
this reunited reunited and it feels and 

941
00:42:55,700 --> 00:42:56,533
um,
and then there's like suddenly they're 

942
00:42:58,011 --> 00:42:58,844
collaborating on a thing like three 
months later I hear they're 

943
00:43:01,311 --> 00:43:02,144
collaborating on a thing.
There's a lot of collaboration going on 

944
00:43:04,970 --> 00:43:05,803
and that I don't know,
that just brings me such joy to know 

945
00:43:07,761 --> 00:43:10,970
that I can create a space for that stuff
to happen.

946
00:43:10,971 --> 00:43:11,804
It is really good.

947
00:43:11,990 --> 00:43:13,520
Yeah.
And I mean I can give you a living,

948
00:43:13,521 --> 00:43:14,354
breathing example of that as you know,
because Rosanne and I became good 

949
00:43:17,031 --> 00:43:19,340
friends and we've been working together 
and doing things.

950
00:43:19,520 --> 00:43:23,000
One of the more interesting ones that 
happened at your place was,

951
00:43:23,420 --> 00:43:24,860
I guess it was probably about a year 
ago,

952
00:43:24,861 --> 00:43:27,440
I met Taylor Negron,
who for those that don't know him was,

953
00:43:27,441 --> 00:43:31,670
he was a brilliant comic actor.
And then stand up really in the eighties

954
00:43:32,120 --> 00:43:33,710
into the nineties,
storytime brilliant,

955
00:43:33,711 --> 00:43:36,770
brilliant guy who I loved without 
knowing him.

956
00:43:36,771 --> 00:43:37,604
And then I met him one night at the fire
pit at your place and we were talking 

957
00:43:41,271 --> 00:43:43,490
and you know,
I could tell like he thought I was funny

958
00:43:43,491 --> 00:43:45,800
that I got it kind of thing and you 
know,

959
00:43:45,801 --> 00:43:46,634
we were talking,
talking and then I told him about my 

960
00:43:47,211 --> 00:43:48,044
show and he said he would do my show.
And then literally two months later I 

961
00:43:50,721 --> 00:43:54,410
found out he was dead like didn't you?
And I assume he knew he was sick.

962
00:43:54,411 --> 00:43:55,244
I don't know a lot about the story,
but those types of things are what's 

963
00:43:58,581 --> 00:44:00,950
going on there.
And that's what was so magical about it.

964
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:01,870
Yeah.
It's,

965
00:44:02,320 --> 00:44:03,153
it's,
and people feel comfortable to be 

966
00:44:05,231 --> 00:44:06,160
themselves there.
I mean,

967
00:44:06,161 --> 00:44:09,070
that's why Roseanne will come to my 
house and I know it's not like I have,

968
00:44:09,071 --> 00:44:09,904
as you know,
there's not like all these a list 

969
00:44:11,651 --> 00:44:14,980
celebrities sitting around my fire pit.
It's not like that actually.

970
00:44:15,310 --> 00:44:16,143
But,
um,

971
00:44:16,240 --> 00:44:17,073
every once in a while Roseanne will come
by and she feels comfortable there 

972
00:44:19,421 --> 00:44:22,420
because no one's like gawking at her or 
whatever.

973
00:44:22,780 --> 00:44:24,600
And um,
but it was like,

974
00:44:24,601 --> 00:44:26,230
I mean,
the first time she came to my house,

975
00:44:26,231 --> 00:44:28,120
it was,
it was one of those moments because even

976
00:44:28,121 --> 00:44:30,070
though I grew up being my dad's daughter
and everything,

977
00:44:30,430 --> 00:44:32,070
these people,
icons to me,

978
00:44:32,400 --> 00:44:33,900
and I'll never forget the first day she 
was there,

979
00:44:33,901 --> 00:44:34,734
her and Rick Overton and Paul Provenza,
we're sitting around the fire pit and 

980
00:44:37,471 --> 00:44:39,240
I'm walking by with some friends and I'm
like going,

981
00:44:39,770 --> 00:44:43,320
Oh God,
what's going on in my backyard?

982
00:44:43,320 --> 00:44:44,850
And meanwhile you're the daughter of 
George Carlin.

983
00:44:45,070 --> 00:44:47,610
So I have no concept of that.
That's just who I am.

984
00:44:47,611 --> 00:44:48,390
So,
yeah,

985
00:44:48,390 --> 00:44:48,890
but,
but,

986
00:44:48,890 --> 00:44:49,723
you know,
and yet this incredible thing starts to 

987
00:44:51,631 --> 00:44:52,820
happen.
And like I said,

988
00:44:52,830 --> 00:44:54,690
believe people will start collaborating 
and it's,

989
00:44:54,691 --> 00:44:55,710
it's just,
it's beautiful.

990
00:44:55,750 --> 00:44:59,040
And I don't even really bring this up so
that for the purposes of name dropping,

991
00:44:59,160 --> 00:45:00,750
something like that,
as much as that,

992
00:45:00,751 --> 00:45:01,584
there's something really interesting 
when you can connect people that care 

993
00:45:04,321 --> 00:45:05,154
about the same things.
And that's really what we're trying to 

994
00:45:06,451 --> 00:45:07,284
do here and that's what I,
and I think that's the hope of our 

995
00:45:10,831 --> 00:45:11,664
species,
is that we can have a safe space for 

996
00:45:14,431 --> 00:45:16,450
conversation.
Um,

997
00:45:16,830 --> 00:45:18,630
and you know,
one of the things about the internet,

998
00:45:18,631 --> 00:45:22,320
which is fabulous because we met on 
twitter and all of that is great,

999
00:45:22,680 --> 00:45:25,920
but there doesn't feel like there's a 
lot of safe space,

1000
00:45:25,921 --> 00:45:26,754
you know,
you have to really filter through a lot 

1001
00:45:30,030 --> 00:45:30,863
of anger and rage and lonely people who 
are trying to make a dent in the world 

1002
00:45:36,960 --> 00:45:38,490
and not do it in a nice way.

1003
00:45:38,940 --> 00:45:42,060
I'm not conducive to conversation or 
listening.

1004
00:45:42,480 --> 00:45:43,313
There's a lot.
There's very little listening going on 

1005
00:45:44,821 --> 00:45:47,280
on the Internet.
There's a lot of talking going on.

1006
00:45:47,640 --> 00:45:49,330
So yes,
uh,

1007
00:45:49,500 --> 00:45:50,910
in,
in our lives,

1008
00:45:50,911 --> 00:45:54,000
we are trying to create space where we 
can hear each other,

1009
00:45:54,360 --> 00:45:55,193
you know.
Uh,

1010
00:45:55,450 --> 00:45:56,283
well I'm glad you mentioned the online 
thing and twitter because one of the 

1011
00:45:58,171 --> 00:46:01,880
things we talk about all the time is I 
don't even have this device.

1012
00:46:02,030 --> 00:46:03,900
The device I was going to go into my 
pocket.

1013
00:46:03,901 --> 00:46:06,430
But fortunately I actually gave it to my
producer before we started.

1014
00:46:06,570 --> 00:46:07,403
I don't have it on me.
This is a rare moment that I don't have 

1015
00:46:08,671 --> 00:46:09,690
my phone on.
Are you reading?

1016
00:46:09,691 --> 00:46:11,220
Are you okay?
I'm totally okay.

1017
00:46:11,221 --> 00:46:12,180
And we're here,
right?

1018
00:46:12,480 --> 00:46:13,830
We're present.
We're here.

1019
00:46:14,190 --> 00:46:16,410
We're having a conference.
Not like it's not right.

1020
00:46:16,411 --> 00:46:17,244
Yeah.
And so the reason I think we talked 

1021
00:46:19,171 --> 00:46:21,030
about all the time is because we hate 
it.

1022
00:46:21,070 --> 00:46:23,630
We and we love it.
I know,

1023
00:46:23,970 --> 00:46:27,810
and yet it brought us together and then 
at the same time I want to make a living

1024
00:46:27,811 --> 00:46:31,860
using it because we find an audience and
we can connect with an audience with it.

1025
00:46:31,861 --> 00:46:34,410
I mean,
I found my voice on twitter.

1026
00:46:34,411 --> 00:46:35,244
I mean,
I learned to write a joke because of 

1027
00:46:36,241 --> 00:46:39,030
twitter and,
and the limit of twitter that go onto me

1028
00:46:39,031 --> 00:46:39,864
of words that,
which I think they're planning on 

1029
00:46:41,521 --> 00:46:42,241
changing.
And I'm like,

1030
00:46:42,241 --> 00:46:45,030
no,
I love twitter,

1031
00:46:45,031 --> 00:46:47,010
but I told you I'm not going to keep 
saying your dad for that.

1032
00:46:47,011 --> 00:46:48,060
Um,
but,

1033
00:46:48,090 --> 00:46:51,690
but this device and this thing that 
we're in this horror,

1034
00:46:51,800 --> 00:46:53,130
um,
what are you,

1035
00:46:53,490 --> 00:46:54,323
what do you.
To me it's a net win at the end of the 

1036
00:46:55,680 --> 00:46:56,181
day,
it's the net week,

1037
00:46:56,181 --> 00:46:57,630
but it is connected.
So many people.

1038
00:46:57,750 --> 00:47:02,040
It's literally helped revolutions in 
Egypt.

1039
00:47:02,230 --> 00:47:03,810
Um,
and then on the other hand,

1040
00:47:03,811 --> 00:47:07,260
I see people's attention spans are being
shredded.

1041
00:47:07,320 --> 00:47:08,153
There's no more stories about that.
Neurons in people's brains are firing 

1042
00:47:11,551 --> 00:47:12,384
differently.
Yeah.

1043
00:47:12,410 --> 00:47:13,800
You know,
every two seconds.

1044
00:47:13,801 --> 00:47:14,634
And if you're on a street corner meeting
a friend where you might have to stand 

1045
00:47:17,161 --> 00:47:19,410
there and look up at the sky,
God forbid you're,

1046
00:47:19,500 --> 00:47:21,570
you know,
you're liking instagram and you're like,

1047
00:47:21,600 --> 00:47:25,380
I don't even like this person,
like all of this stuff.

1048
00:47:25,710 --> 00:47:28,890
I think for me,
what's really.

1049
00:47:28,990 --> 00:47:31,720
I mean we've talked about this before,
but even on a new level,

1050
00:47:31,721 --> 00:47:32,554
just in the last month or so,
I really am starting to get sick of the 

1051
00:47:36,611 --> 00:47:40,660
intrusiveness of it.
How dare it.

1052
00:47:40,780 --> 00:47:41,613
And I say it like it's some sort of 
autonomous thing and I haven't invited 

1053
00:47:44,291 --> 00:47:45,980
it in.
It's not autonomous yet,

1054
00:47:46,010 --> 00:47:49,330
but it does kind of feel that way 
because it's the part of my brain.

1055
00:47:49,360 --> 00:47:51,850
Like I don't feel like I have control 
over that part of my brain.

1056
00:47:51,851 --> 00:47:56,390
So it is feel like,
and I really feel like if you want to be

1057
00:47:57,340 --> 00:47:58,173
the fear is that if you put it away,
you're not going to be part of the 

1058
00:47:59,891 --> 00:48:02,300
culture that you feel like you're 
actually missing.

1059
00:48:02,350 --> 00:48:04,000
So you do feel like you're missing 
something and you know,

1060
00:48:04,001 --> 00:48:06,880
you probably are.
But as you know,

1061
00:48:06,881 --> 00:48:10,630
when you and I do our little retreats 
that are electronic retreats and we turn

1062
00:48:10,631 --> 00:48:13,210
off for a week or 10 days or sometimes a
weekend,

1063
00:48:14,710 --> 00:48:16,570
you don't really miss that much,
you know,

1064
00:48:16,610 --> 00:48:18,070
that's the thing.
So it goes on.

1065
00:48:18,100 --> 00:48:20,230
So right before we launched the show in 
September,

1066
00:48:20,231 --> 00:48:22,690
I got married the week before in Sonoma 
and I've told you this,

1067
00:48:22,691 --> 00:48:26,050
but I did 10 days off.
I did not look at my phone for 10 days.

1068
00:48:26,051 --> 00:48:27,580
I didn't look at email,
I didn't look at twitter,

1069
00:48:27,760 --> 00:48:28,593
I didn't post.
I posted one thing on youtube for 30 

1070
00:48:29,861 --> 00:48:31,390
seconds just to say I'll be back,
don't.

1071
00:48:32,040 --> 00:48:34,230
I wasn't like,
you've been worried about me.

1072
00:48:34,270 --> 00:48:37,220
I don't think anyone is entail fitting 
care.

1073
00:48:38,050 --> 00:48:39,020
I thought they cared,
they didn't.

1074
00:48:39,470 --> 00:48:44,260
But I actually,
I genuinely felt my brain resetting.

1075
00:48:44,290 --> 00:48:46,920
I felt I've described to you before as 
like,

1076
00:48:46,921 --> 00:48:47,754
you know,
when you used to turn on an old desktop 

1077
00:48:48,611 --> 00:48:51,940
computer and there'll be some worrying 
and some being being.

1078
00:48:51,960 --> 00:48:56,410
And I felt bad.
I actually felt that in my head and then

1079
00:48:56,411 --> 00:48:58,030
when I got back I was like,
wow,

1080
00:48:58,031 --> 00:48:59,940
everyone's just up to the same old.
Yeah,

1081
00:49:00,220 --> 00:49:03,700
same old conversations,
same old annoyances,

1082
00:49:03,910 --> 00:49:05,680
same old bitching and moaning.

1083
00:49:05,750 --> 00:49:07,610
And yet we're both agreeing it's net 
good.

1084
00:49:07,730 --> 00:49:09,410
So is that the.
That's the conundrum

1085
00:49:09,620 --> 00:49:13,730
I think in and so it really is like 
everything else,

1086
00:49:13,790 --> 00:49:18,560
it's neutral so it's can be used for 
good or evil and like everything else,

1087
00:49:18,800 --> 00:49:19,633
you have to be conscious about it.
You have to really decide what are you 

1088
00:49:23,961 --> 00:49:28,961
using this for in your life and in and 
in your career and how much of it,

1089
00:49:30,020 --> 00:49:30,853
you know,
what,

1090
00:49:31,070 --> 00:49:31,903
there may be an overall net good,
but how much of it is a net negative in 

1091
00:49:36,801 --> 00:49:41,240
your life and your personal life and in 
your process and your creative process?

1092
00:49:41,750 --> 00:49:42,583
You know,
I've been finding lately that I'm doing 

1093
00:49:44,721 --> 00:49:45,554
much better away from it all because I'm
going deep down to try to figure out 

1094
00:49:49,251 --> 00:49:50,084
what my next book is.
I can't do that when I'm online and I'm 

1095
00:49:54,051 --> 00:49:56,630
doing,
I'm looking out into the world.

1096
00:49:56,631 --> 00:49:57,464
I have to go inside of myself to figure 
that stuff out and do some research and 

1097
00:50:01,881 --> 00:50:02,714
some things,
but I have to be very conscious about 

1098
00:50:04,030 --> 00:50:04,880
what I'm doing.

1099
00:50:05,390 --> 00:50:07,250
Um,
and,

1100
00:50:07,820 --> 00:50:08,653
and that's my process and I'm figuring 
that out and I think the longer we have 

1101
00:50:12,651 --> 00:50:13,484
this technology,
I mean you have to think about it in 

1102
00:50:15,561 --> 00:50:20,480
2008 was the first smartphone.
The first iphone came out.

1103
00:50:20,930 --> 00:50:25,640
That's only been seven years.
So as a species,

1104
00:50:25,700 --> 00:50:29,150
it's nothing as a culture that's 
nothing.

1105
00:50:29,450 --> 00:50:34,400
So we are starting to feel the pain of 
it and,

1106
00:50:34,401 --> 00:50:37,850
and,
and the problems with it and I,

1107
00:50:37,860 --> 00:50:38,693
you know,
and I think we're going to start making 

1108
00:50:39,621 --> 00:50:43,490
some real new decisions about it too.
I'm guessing that,

1109
00:50:43,491 --> 00:50:45,230
I mean it's,
I feel like I'm already doing that in my

1110
00:50:45,231 --> 00:50:46,400
own personal life.

1111
00:50:46,460 --> 00:50:47,293
Yeah.
And not only doing it in your personal 

1112
00:50:48,430 --> 00:50:49,263
and your professional,
so you do a podcast also where you talk 

1113
00:50:51,141 --> 00:50:51,974
a lot about sort of waking up and and 
the spiritual journey that we're on and 

1114
00:50:58,130 --> 00:51:03,130
I think all of that is directly related 
to this stuff because when we're,

1115
00:51:03,650 --> 00:51:06,230
when we're in it,
people are fighting,

1116
00:51:06,500 --> 00:51:08,870
people are approved,
giving you an endless approval.

1117
00:51:08,871 --> 00:51:11,720
But to me it's like the approval stuff,
which is really nice.

1118
00:51:11,750 --> 00:51:13,550
It's nice,
but like that it's like,

1119
00:51:13,580 --> 00:51:14,413
oh well I,
I think I'm putting saying good out 

1120
00:51:15,831 --> 00:51:16,940
there.
So it's nice to be acknowledged.

1121
00:51:16,941 --> 00:51:20,240
I don't really dwell on it.
But then you get some negative stuff and

1122
00:51:20,241 --> 00:51:21,790
it can,
it can spin you out out.

1123
00:51:21,810 --> 00:51:23,510
Tell it days.
And that's what I mean about this.

1124
00:51:23,511 --> 00:51:27,020
All this all being live,
this whole thing is actually alive

1125
00:51:27,120 --> 00:51:30,500
and yet there's something exciting 
about,

1126
00:51:30,810 --> 00:51:31,643
you know,
that if we were really to become a 

1127
00:51:33,331 --> 00:51:34,164
collective,
a conscious collective mind on some 

1128
00:51:37,381 --> 00:51:38,214
level where we could really solve the 
really big problems that we need to 

1129
00:51:42,511 --> 00:51:45,630
solve.
We need many voices to do that.

1130
00:51:45,631 --> 00:51:47,160
I mean,
that's what democracy is about,

1131
00:51:47,161 --> 00:51:50,430
this marketplace of ideas and so it 
invites that,

1132
00:51:50,460 --> 00:51:51,293
you know,
there's this other level of connection 

1133
00:51:53,191 --> 00:51:54,024
that,
you know,

1134
00:51:54,210 --> 00:51:55,043
um,
there's a Pakistani hip hop artists a 

1135
00:51:57,460 --> 00:51:58,171
deal.
Omar,

1136
00:51:58,171 --> 00:52:02,580
who I met also on twitter fan of my dad 
because he saw youtube videos.

1137
00:52:02,581 --> 00:52:06,990
This kid is 20 something in Pakistan,
hip hop artist.

1138
00:52:07,320 --> 00:52:09,600
He was just at my house a few nights 
ago.

1139
00:52:09,990 --> 00:52:10,823
Um,
that's amazing that he and I connected 

1140
00:52:14,731 --> 00:52:18,690
in the world on twitter to begin with 
once again and now we're friends in real

1141
00:52:18,691 --> 00:52:20,300
life.
That's,

1142
00:52:20,650 --> 00:52:24,810
there is hope for a species when we can 
do stuff like that.

1143
00:52:24,810 --> 00:52:25,500
You know,
I,

1144
00:52:25,500 --> 00:52:27,930
we sat around the fire pit the other 
night and we really asked them,

1145
00:52:28,230 --> 00:52:30,600
what's it like there,
what's really going on,

1146
00:52:30,601 --> 00:52:31,434
what's the thinking,
what is the Pakistani government really 

1147
00:52:33,121 --> 00:52:34,200
doing?
You know,

1148
00:52:34,201 --> 00:52:35,034
all this stuff.
I got to have that conversation with 

1149
00:52:37,051 --> 00:52:39,180
someone because of this stuff.
So,

1150
00:52:40,290 --> 00:52:41,580
but,
but,

1151
00:52:41,581 --> 00:52:42,414
you know,
all of the trolling and all of the 

1152
00:52:44,280 --> 00:52:47,770
distraction and all of the Click Bait,
I'm,

1153
00:52:49,200 --> 00:52:51,270
once again,
it's like anything else,

1154
00:52:51,271 --> 00:52:52,104
you either going to let the distraction 
distract you because that's what they 

1155
00:52:54,541 --> 00:52:55,321
all want.
I mean,

1156
00:52:55,321 --> 00:52:57,180
you know,
they were the fuck that is.

1157
00:52:57,840 --> 00:52:58,673
But um,
ultimately keep us fighting with each 

1158
00:53:01,621 --> 00:53:05,490
other and then we can't look at the real
problems and try to solve them.

1159
00:53:05,491 --> 00:53:05,750
That's okay.

1160
00:53:05,750 --> 00:53:06,583
Literally how,
I don't know if you saw in the green 

1161
00:53:08,271 --> 00:53:09,500
room at the beginning of that's how I 
started.

1162
00:53:09,620 --> 00:53:10,271
Yeah.
And,

1163
00:53:10,271 --> 00:53:11,104
and so therefore we're not really having
the real conversations we should be 

1164
00:53:14,721 --> 00:53:18,470
having,
but dammit we are because you're here,

1165
00:53:18,620 --> 00:53:19,453
you're doing this.
There's a lot of real good conversation 

1166
00:53:21,741 --> 00:53:24,040
going on in the world now.
But,

1167
00:53:24,180 --> 00:53:27,870
but we have to be the grownups and say,
Ya know,

1168
00:53:27,871 --> 00:53:28,920
more clickbait.
Sorry,

1169
00:53:28,921 --> 00:53:30,270
I'm not,
I'm not doing it,

1170
00:53:30,271 --> 00:53:31,030
you know,
and the,

1171
00:53:31,030 --> 00:53:31,863
and the ones who are distracted by it,
well there's always going to be mob 

1172
00:53:34,441 --> 00:53:36,720
mentality.
It's part of the species.

1173
00:53:36,721 --> 00:53:37,620
It's how we're wired.

1174
00:53:37,760 --> 00:53:38,593
Yeah.
And that's what's so nice about doing 

1175
00:53:39,471 --> 00:53:40,304
something that I think people are 
responding to the way they are because 

1176
00:53:42,800 --> 00:53:46,160
there's so much crap.
So it's not like there's five things and

1177
00:53:46,161 --> 00:53:47,600
they're finding something that they 
relate to.

1178
00:53:48,020 --> 00:53:51,090
There's a good jillion things and 
they're finding some something that's,

1179
00:53:51,290 --> 00:53:53,810
that gives them a little sense of 
presence or a little center.

1180
00:53:53,920 --> 00:53:55,600
Yes,
people are hungry for it.

1181
00:53:55,930 --> 00:53:57,520
And I think after this,
you know,

1182
00:53:57,521 --> 00:53:58,354
this Internet explosion,
we all had fun being distracted for the 

1183
00:54:01,331 --> 00:54:05,170
last we all 10 years or whatever.
It's all fun to be distracted.

1184
00:54:05,171 --> 00:54:06,820
But now it's also like,
oh,

1185
00:54:06,821 --> 00:54:09,010
it's the hottest year again.
Oh,

1186
00:54:09,011 --> 00:54:10,030
it's crazy weather.
Oh,

1187
00:54:10,031 --> 00:54:11,770
this shit's really going down.
Oh,

1188
00:54:11,771 --> 00:54:14,950
there's no one gonna fucking be sweeping
out of the sky and rescuing us.

1189
00:54:15,340 --> 00:54:16,173
Oh,
maybe we do need to get our shit 

1190
00:54:16,811 --> 00:54:19,060
together.
Maybe we do need to just.

1191
00:54:19,240 --> 00:54:20,073
I mean,
it doesn't have to be these serious 

1192
00:54:21,011 --> 00:54:24,340
heavy as conversations all the time,
but where are the grownups?

1193
00:54:24,610 --> 00:54:26,560
I want to go hang out with the grownups 
and yes,

1194
00:54:26,770 --> 00:54:30,310
smoke some pot and have a nice drink and
laugh and be silly too.

1195
00:54:30,550 --> 00:54:32,020
But um,
yeah,

1196
00:54:32,021 --> 00:54:32,854
I want to be hanging out with the people
that are kind of trying to think 

1197
00:54:34,721 --> 00:54:35,554
straight about that.

1198
00:54:35,740 --> 00:54:36,910
Well,
that's what we're trying to build here.

1199
00:54:36,911 --> 00:54:39,010
I almost feel that that should be the 
ending of the show.

1200
00:54:39,011 --> 00:54:41,680
But I'm going to give you one more.
I'm going to give you one bonus question

1201
00:54:41,890 --> 00:54:43,420
which is what's next?
What's next?

1202
00:54:43,570 --> 00:54:45,010
What's this worth?
What is the next after all this,

1203
00:54:45,011 --> 00:54:45,844
because I know how much,
how much of you you had to pour into 

1204
00:54:47,321 --> 00:54:48,154
this book.
I saw the copies before I saw the 

1205
00:54:49,691 --> 00:54:53,260
manuscript when it was a,
just a printed from your printer and all

1206
00:54:53,261 --> 00:54:54,094
that and how much you had to put 
yourself into this and go into talking 

1207
00:54:57,311 --> 00:55:00,580
about things that are scary to talk 
about and in and expose your,

1208
00:55:00,610 --> 00:55:01,443
not only your dad but your mom in a way 
my whole life and your whole life in a 

1209
00:55:03,761 --> 00:55:05,760
way that people didn't know and you 
know,

1210
00:55:05,980 --> 00:55:06,813
especially because someone like your dad
where he's held up to this thing and 

1211
00:55:08,591 --> 00:55:11,020
that you were showing him in a different
light and all that stuff.

1212
00:55:11,550 --> 00:55:12,520
Where do you go?

1213
00:55:13,120 --> 00:55:13,953
Yeah,
I mean I think there's been kind of two 

1214
00:55:15,791 --> 00:55:16,624
mes the last 10 years,
the one that's had this book in me and 

1215
00:55:19,151 --> 00:55:21,950
know that it was unfinished business and
that I had to,

1216
00:55:23,410 --> 00:55:24,243
that in some ways it was going to give 
me permission to have a bigger 

1217
00:55:26,981 --> 00:55:28,430
conversation in the world.
And,

1218
00:55:28,431 --> 00:55:29,264
and on a personal level it was 
unfinished business just around my 

1219
00:55:33,221 --> 00:55:35,950
psychological healing.
Um,

1220
00:55:36,070 --> 00:55:36,903
I mean I am a person who had studied 
psychology and I do focus more on the 

1221
00:55:40,811 --> 00:55:42,970
inner life and the cultural life on,
on some levels,

1222
00:55:42,980 --> 00:55:44,680
although I'm pretty 50 slash 50 these 
days.

1223
00:55:45,100 --> 00:55:48,830
So really I think my next thing is 
really pointing my,

1224
00:55:48,850 --> 00:55:52,930
my mind slightly more outwards.
You know,

1225
00:55:52,931 --> 00:55:53,764
that it'll always be interested in our 
personal process and how do we get from 

1226
00:55:57,701 --> 00:56:01,840
a to B and B to c and C to d.
But I think they're really connected.

1227
00:56:01,840 --> 00:56:06,840
I think how we do this on the inside the
micro is connected to the macro and,

1228
00:56:07,880 --> 00:56:12,790
and how we treat ourselves is ultimately
how we treat each other and how we treat

1229
00:56:12,791 --> 00:56:13,624
the planet.
And so I'm interested in connecting all 

1230
00:56:15,701 --> 00:56:16,534
of those dots.
I don't know exactly what it looks like 

1231
00:56:18,101 --> 00:56:18,934
right now,
thinking I'm going to start up my 

1232
00:56:20,381 --> 00:56:21,214
podcast again.
I'm looking to something a little more 

1233
00:56:25,060 --> 00:56:25,893
elevated level around the podcast,
maybe with video or something and 

1234
00:56:29,710 --> 00:56:32,020
finding a new format.
Um,

1235
00:56:32,470 --> 00:56:35,500
I've suddenly become the humanist girl I
go to.

1236
00:56:35,680 --> 00:56:39,010
I did a keynote speech at the humanist 
association,

1237
00:56:39,011 --> 00:56:41,350
American Humanist Association conference
last summer.

1238
00:56:41,750 --> 00:56:42,583
I was speaking at the reason rally.
I'm speaking at the reason rally and 

1239
00:56:44,531 --> 00:56:47,800
I've been hired to do another one in May
in Vancouver.

1240
00:56:47,801 --> 00:56:50,500
And I'm suddenly like,
I'm the spiritual humanist girl.

1241
00:56:50,510 --> 00:56:51,330
Uh,
you know,

1242
00:56:51,330 --> 00:56:52,600
it's,
it's very interesting.

1243
00:56:52,601 --> 00:56:53,434
But there's something about soul and 
meaning and the inner life that I think 

1244
00:56:58,451 --> 00:56:59,284
is important and it's important part of 
the conversation and doesn't have to be 

1245
00:57:01,211 --> 00:57:02,044
thrown out just because we don't believe
the whole church bullshit and religion 

1246
00:57:06,620 --> 00:57:08,180
of bullshit.
Um,

1247
00:57:08,210 --> 00:57:10,690
there's still way to find meaning in 
wonder.

1248
00:57:10,691 --> 00:57:14,320
I think wonder is a really important 
aspect.

1249
00:57:14,321 --> 00:57:18,190
If we could get reconnected to the 
wonder of being alive,

1250
00:57:18,830 --> 00:57:20,550
um,
we'd all

1251
00:57:20,600 --> 00:57:23,810
appreciate people a little bit more.
Stop yelling at each other,

1252
00:57:23,840 --> 00:57:25,700
yelling at each other.
Right.

1253
00:57:26,050 --> 00:57:26,883
You know,
I mean obviously it's not going to 

1254
00:57:27,441 --> 00:57:28,070
happen,
but I,

1255
00:57:28,070 --> 00:57:28,903
but I really believe so and I think we 
would really treat our planet a little 

1256
00:57:30,591 --> 00:57:31,424
better.
So I'm,

1257
00:57:31,630 --> 00:57:33,890
I'm kind of want to be in the wonder 
business,

1258
00:57:34,850 --> 00:57:36,160
whatever that means.
Right.

1259
00:57:36,280 --> 00:57:38,450
I did not know that the answer was going
in that direction,

1260
00:57:38,451 --> 00:57:39,800
but it's been,
you know,

1261
00:57:39,860 --> 00:57:40,693
look,
we've been on this adventure for awhile 

1262
00:57:41,240 --> 00:57:43,250
and I look forward to seeing what's,
uh,

1263
00:57:43,280 --> 00:57:44,113
what's next.
You can follow Kelly and give her all 

1264
00:57:46,821 --> 00:57:50,240
your approval and disapproval and all of
that good stuff on twitter.

1265
00:57:50,241 --> 00:57:52,810
It's at Kelly underscore Carla.
She's got the unders.

1266
00:57:52,830 --> 00:57:53,870
I do.
I'm sorry.

1267
00:57:53,871 --> 00:57:54,704
I was,
I was a Dork at the beginning of all 

1268
00:57:55,641 --> 00:57:56,810
this.
I didn't know what was going on.

1269
00:57:56,840 --> 00:57:58,910
Got The underscore.
Or you can check out her book,

1270
00:57:58,911 --> 00:57:59,744
a Carlin Home Companion,
which you can get pretty much anywhere 

1271
00:58:02,360 --> 00:58:04,980
books are sold and thanks for watching.
And uh,

1272
00:58:05,090 --> 00:58:07,430
now we can go get a drink and do the 
other stuff.
