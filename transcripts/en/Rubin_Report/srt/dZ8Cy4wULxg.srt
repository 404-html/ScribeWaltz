1
00:00:05,060 --> 00:00:05,893
Monday was Dr.
Martin Luther King Junior Day and as is 

2
00:00:07,851 --> 00:00:08,684
the case with almost everything lately,
virtually everyone on social media 

3
00:00:11,691 --> 00:00:12,524
seemed to parse out mlks words for 
whatever narrative they're currently 

4
00:00:15,741 --> 00:00:16,574
pushing in our modern times.
I saw articles on how Mlk was the first 

5
00:00:19,491 --> 00:00:21,980
environmentalist,
how he was an ardent feminist,

6
00:00:21,981 --> 00:00:23,420
a communist,
a socialist,

7
00:00:23,421 --> 00:00:24,254
and much more.
The one quote I tweeted of his is 

8
00:00:27,051 --> 00:00:27,884
perhaps his most famous.
I have a dream that my four little 

9
00:00:30,711 --> 00:00:31,544
children will one day live in a nation 
where they will not be judged by the 

10
00:00:34,701 --> 00:00:38,570
color of their skin,
but by the content of their character.

11
00:00:39,350 --> 00:00:44,350
I believe this quote to be as relevant 
now as it was in the early 1960s but for

12
00:00:44,691 --> 00:00:45,524
a whole other set of reasons.
In the 1960s mlk was fighting for 

13
00:00:49,341 --> 00:00:54,230
equality under the law and equality of 
opportunity to things that we should all

14
00:00:54,231 --> 00:00:56,600
absolutely believe in today.

15
00:00:56,600 --> 00:00:57,433
Those who judge people by the color of 
their skin and not the content of their 

16
00:01:01,071 --> 00:01:04,220
character are fighting not for a 
quality,

17
00:01:04,520 --> 00:01:08,570
but for special treatment of some at the
exclusion of others.

18
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:13,310
This misguided principle thinking you 
should treat someone differently because

19
00:01:13,311 --> 00:01:14,144
of their skin color or thinking someone 
should believe what you think they 

20
00:01:17,781 --> 00:01:18,614
should believe because of their skin 
color or any other immutable 

21
00:01:21,051 --> 00:01:24,440
characteristic is the essence of 
prejudice,

22
00:01:24,620 --> 00:01:29,240
which means to prejudge.
This is the complete reverse of what mlk

23
00:01:29,241 --> 00:01:30,074
stood for and sadly this way of thinking
has infected the modern left almost 

24
00:01:34,281 --> 00:01:36,920
completely.
This is why like myself,

25
00:01:36,921 --> 00:01:37,754
so many of you find yourselves on the 
outside of a political bubble that you 

26
00:01:41,341 --> 00:01:44,030
were once safely.
Part of for this direct message though,

27
00:01:44,031 --> 00:01:47,090
I don't want to focus on the flaws of 
identity politics.

28
00:01:47,091 --> 00:01:47,924
Instead,
I want to focus on one of the other 

29
00:01:49,251 --> 00:01:51,920
topics I just mentioned,
socialism,

30
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:52,993
and for the purposes of this message I 
want to put aside whether mlk was a 

31
00:01:55,881 --> 00:01:59,810
capitalist or a communist or a socialist
or a hybrid of any of them.

32
00:02:00,140 --> 00:02:00,973
What I want to discuss is some of the 
reaction around the word socialism 

33
00:02:03,861 --> 00:02:07,340
itself.
The amount of people I see talking about

34
00:02:07,341 --> 00:02:10,400
socialism positively is actually 
staggering.

35
00:02:10,730 --> 00:02:13,970
A tweet I set out saying socialism isn't
cool.

36
00:02:13,971 --> 00:02:14,804
Even got me into a little exchange on 
twitter with the official verified 

37
00:02:17,631 --> 00:02:22,610
Socialist Party who explained to me that
socialism has actually never been tried,

38
00:02:22,790 --> 00:02:24,650
which is why we don't know if it'll work
yet.

39
00:02:24,980 --> 00:02:25,813
Perhaps they should tell that to the 
people of Venezuela right now who were 

40
00:02:28,611 --> 00:02:29,444
fighting for food and basic services as 
they watched their socialist system 

41
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:37,400
collapse on top of them.
The ideas of socialism,

42
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:41,090
that the means of production,
distribution and labor should be owned,

43
00:02:41,091 --> 00:02:41,924
controlled and regulated by the 
community as a whole are the worst sort 

44
00:02:46,101 --> 00:02:46,934
of collectivist ideas which exist.
The very implication that the group 

45
00:02:50,901 --> 00:02:51,734
knows what is good for the individual 
that we exist to do things for the 

46
00:02:55,281 --> 00:03:00,250
greater good is totally antithetical to 
the purpose of being human.

47
00:03:00,550 --> 00:03:03,790
It's your job to find value in your 
work,

48
00:03:03,970 --> 00:03:04,803
to strive for more than you have to 
bring good to yourself and the people 

49
00:03:08,081 --> 00:03:12,250
around you and to live as a free person 
as you see fit.

50
00:03:12,580 --> 00:03:13,413
The very idea that you should set aside 
your individuality for the community as 

51
00:03:17,201 --> 00:03:18,034
a whole,
which virtually always turns into an 

52
00:03:20,141 --> 00:03:25,141
intolerant hostile mob is exactly why so
many have died in socialist regimes.

53
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:30,010
Despite the obvious failures of 
socialism,

54
00:03:30,011 --> 00:03:34,480
Socialists have no problem using the 
freedoms of capitalism against itself.

55
00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:38,620
This is perhaps the most perverse part 
of the socialist worldview.

56
00:03:38,860 --> 00:03:39,693
Much like Islamism,
socialism wants to use our freedoms 

57
00:03:42,551 --> 00:03:45,670
against us until it attains complete 
power.

58
00:03:45,820 --> 00:03:46,653
For example,
they use the tools of twitter and 

59
00:03:48,611 --> 00:03:53,611
facebook companies created through the 
ingenuity of individuals and the freedom

60
00:03:53,681 --> 00:03:58,210
of capitalism to attack the very system 
that they often live in.

61
00:03:58,690 --> 00:03:59,523
By the way,
I'm all for them being able to do this 

62
00:04:01,121 --> 00:04:03,310
even if I don't like what they're doing.

63
00:04:03,610 --> 00:04:04,443
That's the tricky part of freedom.
It even applies to people and ideas you 

64
00:04:07,091 --> 00:04:09,550
don't like.
Just think for a moment,

65
00:04:09,551 --> 00:04:12,460
if we had a socialist government in 
charge right now,

66
00:04:12,490 --> 00:04:16,180
how do you think it would be going for 
free expression and free speech?

67
00:04:16,540 --> 00:04:19,820
How tolerant would they be of all the 
people that they label,

68
00:04:19,821 --> 00:04:20,654
Nazis and bigots,
whatever you may think of Donald Trump 

69
00:04:23,531 --> 00:04:27,040
and the evil capitalists,
are they the ones coming for anyone?

70
00:04:27,041 --> 00:04:30,010
Speech right now,
our reporters being put in jail.

71
00:04:30,310 --> 00:04:31,143
Actually President Obama used the 
espionage act to put a record number of 

72
00:04:34,481 --> 00:04:36,790
reporters in jail,
and as far as I know,

73
00:04:36,791 --> 00:04:39,700
trump who dislikes the press to put it 
mildly,

74
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:42,910
hasn't put anyone in prison for the 
crime of journalism.

75
00:04:43,930 --> 00:04:44,763
Fortunately,
I see a rising tide in America based on 

76
00:04:47,471 --> 00:04:49,720
liberty,
freedom and individual choice.

77
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:53,650
Note how those words themselves are 
somehow thought of as evil.

78
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:56,380
In the socialist lexicon,
liberty,

79
00:04:56,381 --> 00:04:57,214
freedom,
and individual choice must all be 

80
00:04:59,441 --> 00:05:04,030
sacrificed for the greater good.
The what they're not telling you is that

81
00:05:04,031 --> 00:05:09,031
the greater good is usually for the tiny
minority in the elite protected class.

82
00:05:09,550 --> 00:05:10,383
Their ideas have never worked and will 
never work because a system built on 

83
00:05:14,171 --> 00:05:19,171
stripping our humanity is in direct 
conflict with what it means to be human.

84
00:05:19,750 --> 00:05:21,370
I've said it before and I'll say it 
again.

85
00:05:21,371 --> 00:05:22,204
This perfect system which they wish to 
create can never be perfect because we 

86
00:05:26,471 --> 00:05:29,980
humans as flawed as we are,
are part of it.

87
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:33,820
Imperfect beings cannot create a perfect
system,

88
00:05:34,030 --> 00:05:34,863
but what we can create as a system that 
always does its best to further the 

89
00:05:38,321 --> 00:05:42,070
advancement of human freedom for all its
flaws.

90
00:05:42,100 --> 00:05:42,933
This is what capitalism is,
which is why if you're watching this 

91
00:05:46,061 --> 00:05:46,894
from a capitalist society,
you should consider yourself one of the 

92
00:05:49,631 --> 00:05:50,500
lucky ones.

93
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:51,520
Of course,
in America,

94
00:05:51,521 --> 00:05:54,280
politicians don't outright call 
themselves socialists.

95
00:05:54,281 --> 00:05:56,680
They say that their democratic 
socialists,

96
00:05:56,930 --> 00:05:57,763
this is Bernie Sanders Mantra as he 
calls for a revolution of every kind to 

97
00:06:00,681 --> 00:06:03,410
be a political,
social or even environmental,

98
00:06:03,411 --> 00:06:04,244
whatever that means.
What Bernie forgets or intentionally 

99
00:06:06,141 --> 00:06:08,780
obfuscates is that the democratic part 
of this,

100
00:06:08,781 --> 00:06:09,614
of course,
will always be tossed away as socialism 

101
00:06:12,501 --> 00:06:13,334
takes root.
It's also why there's no doubt in my 

102
00:06:14,901 --> 00:06:17,360
mind that eventually the social justice 
movement,

103
00:06:17,361 --> 00:06:18,194
we'll turn on Bernie himself and I think
there's already plenty of evidence of 

104
00:06:20,901 --> 00:06:21,734
that.
Democracy is the enemy of socialism and 

105
00:06:24,381 --> 00:06:25,214
Bernie's trying to have it both ways.
There's also a reason that the social 

106
00:06:28,701 --> 00:06:32,150
justice movement has such a socialist 
strain within it.

107
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:35,300
Both of these movements based on 
frowning,

108
00:06:35,301 --> 00:06:36,134
on achievement and accomplishment,
and a resentment of those who break the 

109
00:06:39,231 --> 00:06:40,064
mold,
need people to be oppressed or at least 

110
00:06:42,711 --> 00:06:46,220
believe that they're oppressed,
to survive creativity,

111
00:06:46,221 --> 00:06:51,221
free thought and the pursuit of your own
happiness is the antidote to both social

112
00:06:51,531 --> 00:06:52,364
justice and socialism.
It's either that or a life of 

113
00:06:55,611 --> 00:06:56,930
bitterness,
resentment,

114
00:06:56,931 --> 00:06:57,764
and jealousy,
which in my view is less socialism and 

115
00:07:00,831 --> 00:07:02,690
more just antisocial.

116
00:07:06,710 --> 00:07:07,543
Okay.

117
00:07:07,980 --> 00:07:11,400
Joining me today is the founder and 
director of turning point USA,

118
00:07:11,401 --> 00:07:14,250
a student organization for young 
conservatives,

119
00:07:14,251 --> 00:07:17,340
which advocates for free markets and 
limited government.

120
00:07:17,580 --> 00:07:19,170
Charlie Kirk,
welcome to the Rubin report.

121
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:20,400
Glad to be here.
Big Fan.

122
00:07:20,460 --> 00:07:22,740
That's great.
Young Conservatives.

123
00:07:22,741 --> 00:07:26,460
I thought there was no such thing and 
that was like the Yeti or the Unicorn or

124
00:07:26,461 --> 00:07:27,294
Falcor or something.
There's more of us than you might 

125
00:07:29,551 --> 00:07:31,020
imagine.
It's not all conservative.

126
00:07:31,021 --> 00:07:33,690
Some are libertarians,
some are free thinkers,

127
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:35,880
independence,
people on the center.

128
00:07:35,881 --> 00:07:38,400
Right.
We just had that amazing conference that

129
00:07:38,401 --> 00:07:41,160
you were nice enough to come down and 
speak at in Florida.

130
00:07:41,540 --> 00:07:42,660
Uh,
2000,

131
00:07:42,661 --> 00:07:45,240
600,
700 students from all 50 states.

132
00:07:45,540 --> 00:07:46,373
And it was so funny.
I couldn't pay the media outlets to 

133
00:07:48,210 --> 00:07:49,043
cover this.
Then you know,

134
00:07:49,260 --> 00:07:51,240
I was calling up the New York Times,
Washington Post here.

135
00:07:51,241 --> 00:07:52,270
We had,
you know,

136
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:53,153
thousands of students given up their 
winter break to come here from you and 

137
00:07:56,731 --> 00:07:58,380
me and the best speakers,
you know,

138
00:07:58,381 --> 00:07:59,214
that advocate for freedom and none of 
the media outlets in the traditional 

139
00:08:01,531 --> 00:08:02,730
media outlets covered it.

140
00:08:02,730 --> 00:08:03,900
But it's amazing.
There is a,

141
00:08:04,110 --> 00:08:07,560
there is a revolution happening on these
campuses but it's not,

142
00:08:07,860 --> 00:08:09,840
it's not against,
you know,

143
00:08:09,841 --> 00:08:10,710
conservatives,
all this,

144
00:08:10,711 --> 00:08:11,220
it's,
it's,

145
00:08:11,220 --> 00:08:14,730
it's a new train of thought that we want
freedom,

146
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:17,100
we want smaller government but it's also
fighting the culture war,

147
00:08:17,101 --> 00:08:17,934
which is for free speech,
for diversity of ideas and really 

148
00:08:20,821 --> 00:08:22,760
against what these college campuses have
created.

149
00:08:22,830 --> 00:08:23,663
Yes.
So you're in the thick of a lot of the 

150
00:08:24,901 --> 00:08:26,850
things obviously that we talk about 
here.

151
00:08:26,851 --> 00:08:29,790
So first I just want to talk briefly 
about how we met,

152
00:08:29,820 --> 00:08:33,810
because I think it's kind of,
it kind of shows sort of how you operate

153
00:08:33,811 --> 00:08:34,644
and why turning point has taken off.
So we had met about a month and a half 

154
00:08:37,650 --> 00:08:40,350
ago at the is freedom Santeria then in 
palm springs.

155
00:08:40,590 --> 00:08:41,990
Where you,
where you at panelists?

156
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:46,290
There I was a panelist and he's kind of 
helicoptering around of a lot of friends

157
00:08:46,291 --> 00:08:47,030
that,
you know,

158
00:08:47,030 --> 00:08:49,710
attending that conference you were there
and everyone was like,

159
00:08:49,711 --> 00:08:51,600
oh you got to meet Charlie [inaudible].
Got To be trying to hurt.

160
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:52,473
We met for two seconds.
You said a couple of Nice things about 

161
00:08:54,601 --> 00:08:55,860
me and you're like,
know we're doing this,

162
00:08:56,130 --> 00:08:56,963
uh,
our gig in palm springs in a couple of 

163
00:08:58,260 --> 00:08:59,860
weeks,
why don't you come down and talk and,

164
00:08:59,930 --> 00:09:00,763
and then,
and immediately we worked it out and 

165
00:09:02,130 --> 00:09:04,920
your guys send me the paper work the 
next day and it was done.

166
00:09:05,340 --> 00:09:06,173
And I think that does illustrate 
something cause we're going to get into 

167
00:09:07,771 --> 00:09:08,604
some of the issues that should be agree 
on and some of the things we disagree 

168
00:09:10,471 --> 00:09:12,060
on.
But basically you were like,

169
00:09:12,061 --> 00:09:12,511
look,
you're,

170
00:09:12,511 --> 00:09:15,210
you're down for free speech.
That's the main thing here.

171
00:09:15,660 --> 00:09:19,360
And I want my audience to,
to hear you talk about it.

172
00:09:19,410 --> 00:09:19,820
Well,
I,

173
00:09:19,820 --> 00:09:22,570
you're a rational thinker,
which is really rare to find them.

174
00:09:22,590 --> 00:09:23,460
California.
I'm kidding.

175
00:09:23,910 --> 00:09:24,743
But no,
I mean I'm a big fan of the show and I 

176
00:09:25,801 --> 00:09:28,230
watch a lot,
every interviews and I know you're,

177
00:09:28,290 --> 00:09:29,123
you know,
you have a huge following amongst young 

178
00:09:30,061 --> 00:09:32,030
people and I mean,
I met you,

179
00:09:32,031 --> 00:09:32,671
I met you.
I was like,

180
00:09:32,671 --> 00:09:33,780
yeah,
let's get you on board.

181
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:34,673
I'm a,
I've always been a gut player for 

182
00:09:35,191 --> 00:09:35,761
better,
for worse.

183
00:09:35,761 --> 00:09:37,230
It's gotten me into a little bit of 
trouble at times,

184
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:40,470
but I think it's been positive.
You just have to,

185
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:43,380
you have to go with your gut and make 
quick decisions and similar,

186
00:09:43,381 --> 00:09:46,560
that's where I met kandace owens to 
who's now doing a wonderful job with us.

187
00:09:46,561 --> 00:09:49,770
And it took me about 45 seconds until I 
offered her a job.

188
00:09:50,260 --> 00:09:51,093
Literally,
I think it happened right in front of 

189
00:09:52,521 --> 00:09:53,630
me.
And then you walked up to him.

190
00:09:53,631 --> 00:09:54,500
That's right.
Candice was like,

191
00:09:54,501 --> 00:09:56,030
I just got a job.
And you were like,

192
00:09:56,031 --> 00:09:58,400
let me do something with you.
And it was just like,

193
00:09:58,401 --> 00:09:58,881
all right,
look,

194
00:09:58,881 --> 00:10:03,840
this guy's obviously open to some 
different people in total in the Schema,

195
00:10:03,860 --> 00:10:04,420
what's going on.

196
00:10:04,420 --> 00:10:06,100
You need the diversity of ideas,
right?

197
00:10:06,130 --> 00:10:06,963
If you,
if you're in a room where everyone 

198
00:10:07,841 --> 00:10:10,480
thinks exactly the same,
that would be a university.

199
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:11,553
So,
uh,

200
00:10:11,980 --> 00:10:12,813
you,
you need the diversity ideas and you 

201
00:10:13,901 --> 00:10:14,734
need,
you need to be able to challenge your 

202
00:10:16,091 --> 00:10:19,120
viewpoint around a broader theme of 
freedom.

203
00:10:19,510 --> 00:10:22,300
Um,
that really is okay to have that sort of

204
00:10:22,301 --> 00:10:22,810
discussion.

205
00:10:22,810 --> 00:10:23,643
Yeah.
So to,

206
00:10:23,710 --> 00:10:25,930
to illustrate that point.
So then about,

207
00:10:25,950 --> 00:10:26,783
uh,
I think it was the week before 

208
00:10:28,060 --> 00:10:28,893
Christmas,
you guys do this.

209
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:33,850
I was it the largest conservative 
college group we're waiting for.

210
00:10:33,980 --> 00:10:36,440
We're waiting for someone to correct us.
We've done some research.

211
00:10:36,441 --> 00:10:40,640
We have never found anything even close 
and you'll have 2,650

212
00:10:40,641 --> 00:10:41,474
students from all 50 states.
No one's really found anything even 

213
00:10:44,571 --> 00:10:45,404
comparable of size.
So we call it the largest until someone 

214
00:10:47,091 --> 00:10:47,924
corrects us.

215
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:50,220
Well,
there you had some protesters out there,

216
00:10:50,250 --> 00:10:52,110
you know,
they show up all the time to everything.

217
00:10:52,340 --> 00:10:53,173
But,
but there was true diversity of thought 

218
00:10:54,550 --> 00:10:55,383
there.
It was also sort of a Reuben report and 

219
00:10:57,061 --> 00:11:00,240
reunion for me because prager was there 
and Gutfeld was there.

220
00:11:00,270 --> 00:11:01,103
All my best friend candace was there 
obviously and and a whole bunch of 

221
00:11:03,991 --> 00:11:04,440
other,
sure.

222
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:07,380
Well trump junior was there.
Is it just a series of people?

223
00:11:08,430 --> 00:11:11,910
I went up there and I talked about being
gay,

224
00:11:11,911 --> 00:11:15,960
married and I talked about being pro 
choice and a and a bunch of other things

225
00:11:15,961 --> 00:11:16,794
that if you were to poll the average 
conservative that perhaps they're not 

226
00:11:19,741 --> 00:11:21,330
for I think gay marriage.
Maybe it's a little,

227
00:11:21,540 --> 00:11:22,373
a little different at this point,
but I got a standing ovation and 

228
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:27,140
everywhere that I lost.
Yeah,

229
00:11:27,740 --> 00:11:28,573
a bunch of times and,
and everywhere that I went for those 

230
00:11:30,811 --> 00:11:32,850
two,
three days that I was there and it,

231
00:11:32,970 --> 00:11:35,580
and by no means was this just me.
I mean Ben Shapiro came out,

232
00:11:35,581 --> 00:11:36,930
it was like,
it was like Elvis.

233
00:11:37,610 --> 00:11:40,800
I going to say it was like the rolling 
stones is nuts,

234
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:43,770
but that happened to everybody.
I went for breakfast,

235
00:11:43,771 --> 00:11:46,710
I need coffee before I talked to people.
Yet I'm literally,

236
00:11:46,711 --> 00:11:48,840
there's a line of a hundred people 
popping up.

237
00:11:48,841 --> 00:11:49,674
It's like they start swearing.
But that said something to me beyond 

238
00:11:52,861 --> 00:11:54,220
the,
that there's something

239
00:11:54,220 --> 00:11:58,000
else going on with young people right 
now where they actually,

240
00:11:58,330 --> 00:11:59,410
as the young people say,
they're,

241
00:11:59,411 --> 00:12:02,290
they're really woke.
So what's happening here?

242
00:12:02,470 --> 00:12:03,303
And it's that diversity of ideas that I 
think illustrates what makes our 

243
00:12:05,411 --> 00:12:06,244
organization so unique.
So a reporter came up to me and he was 

244
00:12:09,010 --> 00:12:10,330
totally dishonest guy.
Like,

245
00:12:10,331 --> 00:12:10,601
well,
this,

246
00:12:10,601 --> 00:12:13,210
this feels like a Donald Trump rally.
I said,

247
00:12:13,211 --> 00:12:14,530
how could you possibly say that?
Sure.

248
00:12:14,531 --> 00:12:16,360
We have trump jr.
We have Gorka.

249
00:12:16,660 --> 00:12:20,140
We also Austin Petersen who ran for 
president in the Libertarian Party.

250
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:20,993
Yeah,
we have Ruben who is not a leftist 

251
00:12:23,891 --> 00:12:24,724
anymore,
but he's somewhere out there and he 

252
00:12:25,331 --> 00:12:27,160
believes in freedom,
right?

253
00:12:27,220 --> 00:12:29,860
We've been Shapiro who literally led the
never trump,

254
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:31,313
right?
We,

255
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:33,250
we,
we have a huge diversity.

256
00:12:33,380 --> 00:12:36,580
Dorsey of ideas.
And each speaker was respected,

257
00:12:36,581 --> 00:12:37,960
was given,
standing ovations,

258
00:12:37,961 --> 00:12:38,794
was challenged appropriately.
And I think that really says something 

259
00:12:42,341 --> 00:12:46,120
about this new conservate terrian 
movement that we're helping create,

260
00:12:46,450 --> 00:12:50,860
which is we don't have to agree on 100% 
of conservative dogma.

261
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:53,440
Let's just get the big stuff right.
The big stuff.

262
00:12:53,620 --> 00:12:55,510
Is America a great country?
Yes.

263
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:57,400
It's free enterprise a good thing.
Yes.

264
00:12:57,640 --> 00:12:58,361
You know,
it's freedom.

265
00:12:58,361 --> 00:13:00,880
Something that we should really embrace 
as a general idea.

266
00:13:00,881 --> 00:13:02,560
Yes.
It's socialism bad.

267
00:13:02,710 --> 00:13:03,543
Yes.
That's just pretty much the main key 

268
00:13:05,531 --> 00:13:07,810
points in the rest of the stuff we can 
argue and disagree with.

269
00:13:07,811 --> 00:13:08,860
Respectfully.
Yeah.

270
00:13:09,010 --> 00:13:10,630
When did you wake up to some of this 
stuff?

271
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:13,640
So just tell me a little bit about your 
growing up and your situation.

272
00:13:13,650 --> 00:13:14,680
I was ugly.
Politics,

273
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:15,671
current,
crazy,

274
00:13:15,671 --> 00:13:16,504
crazy kid growing up.
Grew up in the northwest suburbs of 

275
00:13:18,071 --> 00:13:19,420
Chicago.
Um,

276
00:13:19,450 --> 00:13:20,283
always as a conservative Republican 
growing up around a lot of leftists and 

277
00:13:23,891 --> 00:13:28,090
liberals in my public high school.
And I was young and conservative like,

278
00:13:28,380 --> 00:13:29,213
cause I actually,
I loved history and I was always 

279
00:13:30,281 --> 00:13:31,091
contrarion.
Right.

280
00:13:31,091 --> 00:13:33,100
So I'd always be challenging my 
teachers.

281
00:13:33,100 --> 00:13:35,470
My parents were generally republican,
right.

282
00:13:35,471 --> 00:13:36,290
They weren't,
you know,

283
00:13:36,290 --> 00:13:38,510
necessarily political,
but they were center,

284
00:13:38,511 --> 00:13:40,450
right.
Bill O'Reilly factor watching,

285
00:13:40,451 --> 00:13:42,340
you know,
Republicans that I always used to say.

286
00:13:42,670 --> 00:13:45,220
And then I would always just challenged 
teachers that would say that,

287
00:13:45,370 --> 00:13:46,203
you know,
all conservatives want to do is kill 

288
00:13:47,351 --> 00:13:49,600
poor people and you know,
pollute the environment.

289
00:13:49,601 --> 00:13:50,950
The typical talking points,
right?

290
00:13:50,951 --> 00:13:52,900
Yeah.
And being the kind of,

291
00:13:53,110 --> 00:13:54,430
you know,
red bull,

292
00:13:54,431 --> 00:13:55,264
I guess you could say.
I'd always challenged the teachers and 

293
00:13:56,651 --> 00:13:57,221
say,
well no,

294
00:13:57,221 --> 00:13:58,054
Ronald Reagan lifted more people out of 
poverty than you're crazy social 

295
00:14:00,401 --> 00:14:02,950
programs that Jimmy Carter,
it drove them nuts and I found enjoyment

296
00:14:02,951 --> 00:14:04,390
in it.
And uh,

297
00:14:04,570 --> 00:14:05,091
you know,
the,

298
00:14:05,091 --> 00:14:06,790
the further down that rabbit hole you 
get,

299
00:14:06,791 --> 00:14:09,430
the more you read Milton Friedman,
the more you understand the foundational

300
00:14:09,431 --> 00:14:11,500
principles and ideas.
At a young age.

301
00:14:11,501 --> 00:14:14,680
I just became on fire for politics and 
for economics.

302
00:14:14,680 --> 00:14:15,513
And Long Story Short,
I started this organization when I was 

303
00:14:17,471 --> 00:14:21,670
18 instead of going to college and ended
up being a wonderful decision and helped

304
00:14:21,700 --> 00:14:25,540
really place myself in a movement that 
was waiting to be grown.

305
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:29,350
And this is something a lot bigger than 
just politics.

306
00:14:29,650 --> 00:14:30,483
This is the fight for the soul of the 
country and it has to start on college 

307
00:14:33,371 --> 00:14:36,430
campuses and it's really the struggle 
for our generation and it's,

308
00:14:36,431 --> 00:14:37,780
it's really,
if you divide it,

309
00:14:37,781 --> 00:14:38,614
it's do we want,
do we believe America's the greatest 

310
00:14:40,931 --> 00:14:43,870
country in the history of the world and 
do we believe freedom is a good thing or

311
00:14:43,871 --> 00:14:44,704
do we want to go a completely different 
direction that looks much more like a 

312
00:14:47,531 --> 00:14:50,770
European socialist democracy that does 
not honor civil liberties,

313
00:14:50,930 --> 00:14:54,800
that does not honor private property and
really deteriorates everything that made

314
00:14:54,801 --> 00:14:58,190
America great place that that's the 
decision our generation has to make.

315
00:14:58,840 --> 00:14:59,673
It's kind of funny,
you're sort of like the non Silicon 

316
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:04,600
Valley version of like Bill Gates or 
Steve Jobs,

317
00:15:04,630 --> 00:15:05,463
the guy that didn't quite flattering but
didn't go to college or dropped out of 

318
00:15:07,691 --> 00:15:10,990
college and now you're talking to 
college people.

319
00:15:10,991 --> 00:15:14,470
When did you realize that that was the 
place that this battle had to be?

320
00:15:14,650 --> 00:15:14,970
Right.

321
00:15:14,970 --> 00:15:17,170
The first couple of years of starting 
turning point USA,

322
00:15:17,171 --> 00:15:19,510
it started as kind of a generic student 
organization,

323
00:15:19,511 --> 00:15:22,090
but just like any good innovator and 
entrepreneur.

324
00:15:22,091 --> 00:15:22,924
I listened and I learned and I realized 
there was such frustration amongst self 

325
00:15:27,161 --> 00:15:27,994
identified conservative Libertarians on 
campus that were not being properly 

326
00:15:30,761 --> 00:15:34,630
channeled and organized.
They felt as if they were being targeted

327
00:15:34,750 --> 00:15:38,080
and that they were being suppressed and 
their ideas were not being allowed to be

328
00:15:38,081 --> 00:15:40,210
heard.
And we made a decision.

329
00:15:40,211 --> 00:15:41,044
That turning point after a couple of 
years is let's not just fight the 

330
00:15:43,211 --> 00:15:44,044
political war.
Let's double down and fight the culture 

331
00:15:45,491 --> 00:15:46,324
war and that we,
we can be the champions of free speech 

332
00:15:48,731 --> 00:15:50,740
and we can be the ambassadors of 
freedom.

333
00:15:50,980 --> 00:15:55,030
Where really you see these campuses,
I call them islands at totalitarianism.

334
00:15:55,570 --> 00:15:56,403
You know,
their idea of diversity is a group of 

335
00:15:57,941 --> 00:16:00,550
people that all look different,
but they think the same.

336
00:16:00,940 --> 00:16:01,773
That's not diversity.
And so turning point has benefited 

337
00:16:03,671 --> 00:16:04,504
tremendously over the last couple of 
years of really being the champions of 

338
00:16:07,901 --> 00:16:09,850
free speech and also saying,
Hey,

339
00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:11,830
we're not,
Republicans were not conservatives.

340
00:16:11,831 --> 00:16:13,570
We're not libertarians.
You can call us all that stuff.

341
00:16:13,571 --> 00:16:14,404
That's fine.
We have members that are across that 

342
00:16:16,901 --> 00:16:19,360
whole spectrum.
As long as you believe in freedom,

343
00:16:19,361 --> 00:16:21,460
you believe America's a great country.
Welcome aboard.

344
00:16:21,990 --> 00:16:26,460
Do you think the idea of having that 
kind of wide tent is part of the appeal?

345
00:16:26,461 --> 00:16:28,800
Like I think people are so sick of the 
labels and all that.

346
00:16:28,801 --> 00:16:29,634
Total is cool.
I spend actually most of the weekend 

347
00:16:31,410 --> 00:16:33,120
hanging out with,
with Austin.

348
00:16:33,420 --> 00:16:34,253
Uh,
but part of it also hanging out with 

349
00:16:34,951 --> 00:16:37,020
Tommy and candace and a whole bunch of 
other people and I was like,

350
00:16:37,230 --> 00:16:38,550
there really is.
And then,

351
00:16:38,551 --> 00:16:39,600
and then uh,
you know,

352
00:16:39,601 --> 00:16:42,300
Alison Stuckey was there and a couple of
other people and I was like,

353
00:16:42,330 --> 00:16:43,163
wow,
these people actually really do think 

354
00:16:44,491 --> 00:16:45,530
different things.
Totally.

355
00:16:45,560 --> 00:16:46,393
[inaudible] and my libertarian side 
usually goes to kind of where Austin's 

356
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:49,993
that,
but I was like,

357
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:53,040
we were all having dinner after and 
having some great thing.

358
00:16:53,060 --> 00:16:54,240
Then I was like,
this is great.

359
00:16:54,241 --> 00:16:57,240
We're having real discussions about,
we're really big and into this.

360
00:16:57,241 --> 00:16:57,430
Right.

361
00:16:57,430 --> 00:17:00,100
And there is that disagreement,
but if you put them all in a room,

362
00:17:00,101 --> 00:17:01,510
they built,
they get the big stuff.

363
00:17:01,511 --> 00:17:02,290
Right,
right.

364
00:17:02,290 --> 00:17:03,123
You know,
do we believe that free enterprise has 

365
00:17:04,181 --> 00:17:05,014
been a net positive for humanity?
Do we believe the constitution is a 

366
00:17:07,271 --> 00:17:09,340
great political document that should be 
preserved,

367
00:17:09,341 --> 00:17:10,510
protected,
and better understood.

368
00:17:10,810 --> 00:17:12,850
Do we believe America has been a 
wonderful,

369
00:17:12,970 --> 00:17:14,800
you know,
net benefit for humanity.

370
00:17:14,980 --> 00:17:15,813
You know,
over the last 200 years they probably 

371
00:17:17,231 --> 00:17:19,900
agreed wholeheartedly and all that.
It's the other stuff where they start to

372
00:17:19,901 --> 00:17:23,710
have a little philosophical differences,
but that disagreement is not being found

373
00:17:23,711 --> 00:17:24,544
on the left right now.
If you disagree with one core tenant of 

374
00:17:27,641 --> 00:17:29,620
leftist dogma,
you're ostracized.

375
00:17:29,621 --> 00:17:31,660
You're kicked out,
and that shows their,

376
00:17:31,661 --> 00:17:34,030
they're not a diverse political 
movement.

377
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:35,193
The new modern American left,
they're extremely intolerant of 

378
00:17:37,841 --> 00:17:39,320
differing opinions.
And I don't have to talk,

379
00:17:39,770 --> 00:17:42,400
I mean I love this,
let you take this day around my agent,

380
00:17:42,410 --> 00:17:43,820
but listen,
I would gladly,

381
00:17:43,821 --> 00:17:45,710
I said this when I had your online last 
week,

382
00:17:45,830 --> 00:17:50,130
I will gladly give you the exact same 
speech that I gave to you guys

383
00:17:50,130 --> 00:17:50,963
a couple of weeks ago.
I would love to give that exact same 

384
00:17:52,891 --> 00:17:56,100
speech to any progressive or Democrat 
and you guys are standing ovation,

385
00:17:56,280 --> 00:17:59,100
but I'm not going to get with my maggot 
hat wearing the students.

386
00:17:59,101 --> 00:17:59,750
Right?
Yeah.

387
00:17:59,750 --> 00:18:00,583
And that's it.
But you give that speech to the young 

388
00:18:02,281 --> 00:18:03,114
Democrats,
socialists of America conference coming 

389
00:18:04,441 --> 00:18:07,950
up in a couple months,
you'll get booze and you'll get weak.

390
00:18:07,951 --> 00:18:09,810
Shouldn't hear things.
We disagree with,

391
00:18:10,130 --> 00:18:11,760
you know,
Bolshevik,

392
00:18:11,910 --> 00:18:12,990
you know,
forever.

393
00:18:12,991 --> 00:18:13,824
It's,
these people have have translated into 

394
00:18:16,291 --> 00:18:17,124
total authoritarianism.
Do you see a moment where both of the 

395
00:18:20,551 --> 00:18:21,384
movements sort of where you would argue 
the conservative sort of lost their 

396
00:18:23,791 --> 00:18:26,100
place,
thus lost the culture war or,

397
00:18:26,120 --> 00:18:28,650
and where the left Sorta went bananas?
Yeah,

398
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:32,820
I think the [inaudible] has gone bananas
just by default of their positions.

399
00:18:32,821 --> 00:18:33,654
They really,
inside of every leftist is a 

400
00:18:36,181 --> 00:18:37,700
totalitarian waiting,
you know,

401
00:18:37,770 --> 00:18:42,060
screaming to get out is a great quote I 
always use is because when you argue for

402
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:43,073
total government power and total 
government control of health care in 

403
00:18:45,091 --> 00:18:45,924
schools and private economic decisions,
that can easily be translated into the 

404
00:18:50,341 --> 00:18:53,130
monitoring side of personal capacity 
decisions,

405
00:18:53,131 --> 00:18:53,570
right?

406
00:18:53,570 --> 00:18:57,600
That that translation is quite simple.
And I always say to a leftist that says,

407
00:18:57,601 --> 00:18:58,500
well,
I believe in,

408
00:18:58,650 --> 00:18:59,580
you know,
civil liberties,

409
00:18:59,581 --> 00:19:01,680
but I also believe in government run 
schools and health care.

410
00:19:01,681 --> 00:19:02,514
And as I say,
if you don't trust the government to 

411
00:19:04,471 --> 00:19:06,390
help you know,
to monitor your own personal life,

412
00:19:06,391 --> 00:19:07,224
why on earth would you trust the 
government to run all these other 

413
00:19:08,371 --> 00:19:09,204
institutions?
Where I think conservatives have gotten 

414
00:19:10,741 --> 00:19:15,600
it wrong over the last 30 years is where
conservatives have become mislabeled and

415
00:19:15,601 --> 00:19:19,020
sometimes some concerns of believe this 
to want to do social engineering.

416
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:21,300
I think I'm going to have angelical 
Christian,

417
00:19:21,330 --> 00:19:22,163
I'm a pro life conservative,
but I also believe government should 

418
00:19:24,361 --> 00:19:27,870
have barriers and trying to instill 
those values upon society.

419
00:19:27,871 --> 00:19:28,704
I think the best persuasion in the best 
capacity for good is done through 

420
00:19:31,561 --> 00:19:32,394
churches and local community movements 
and individuals persuading individuals 

421
00:19:35,551 --> 00:19:36,384
and writing books and doing podcasts,
not through government doing massive 

422
00:19:39,001 --> 00:19:40,320
social engineering programs.

423
00:19:40,530 --> 00:19:43,470
So I think that's where conservatives 
have lost their way and that's where the

424
00:19:43,471 --> 00:19:45,360
left is currently trying to stake their 
claim.

425
00:19:46,020 --> 00:19:48,600
Is there anything that you think 
government does well?

426
00:19:49,350 --> 00:19:50,460
No.
No.

427
00:19:50,461 --> 00:19:54,990
I think government is a necessary evil.
I think it's necessary for providing for

428
00:19:54,991 --> 00:19:55,824
the national defense because that is 
something that whether we like it or 

429
00:19:58,051 --> 00:19:58,890
not,
you have to,

430
00:19:59,070 --> 00:20:01,950
you have to delegate some of our 
personal freedom to,

431
00:20:02,150 --> 00:20:03,060
you know,
have a,

432
00:20:03,420 --> 00:20:06,540
some sort of a civil society.
But government by its essence,

433
00:20:06,570 --> 00:20:08,460
if you read what Milton Friedman has 
said,

434
00:20:08,550 --> 00:20:09,383
they're incentivized to be inefficient.
They're incentivized by definition to 

435
00:20:12,841 --> 00:20:17,841
not be able to provide the best possible
good or service for the individual.

436
00:20:18,181 --> 00:20:19,014
So look,
the private sector does everything 

437
00:20:20,161 --> 00:20:20,994
better.
Whether it be the inefficiency of the 

438
00:20:21,541 --> 00:20:22,374
post office or a Medicare is bankrupt.
Social Security doesn't serve the 

439
00:20:24,901 --> 00:20:25,880
people,
you know,

440
00:20:25,890 --> 00:20:28,770
effectively everything government 
touches goes to crap.

441
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:29,873
And the private sector is by definition 
more efficient because if you don't do 

442
00:20:32,431 --> 00:20:34,440
it well,
you're not going to exist much longer.

443
00:20:34,710 --> 00:20:38,310
What do you think is the best way of 
getting that message across then?

444
00:20:38,311 --> 00:20:39,144
Government just doesn't do things well 
cause I think it's just so built into 

445
00:20:41,881 --> 00:20:45,720
people partly because our education is 
term screwed up or whatever,

446
00:20:45,990 --> 00:20:49,120
that they just feel the government 
should just do things.

447
00:20:49,121 --> 00:20:49,954
So I saw Bernie tweeted the other day,
this video of all these millionaires 

448
00:20:53,651 --> 00:20:56,710
saying,
I responded and so I retweeted it,

449
00:20:56,711 --> 00:20:59,020
which got like 20,000
but we read tweets because it was like,

450
00:20:59,230 --> 00:21:01,480
it's all these millionaires saying we 
should be taxed more.

451
00:21:01,481 --> 00:21:03,160
We should be taxed more.
Well,

452
00:21:03,410 --> 00:21:05,860
what's a lectural hippocrates such lies.
It's like,

453
00:21:05,861 --> 00:21:06,221
well,
Hey,

454
00:21:06,221 --> 00:21:09,880
what's stopping you from paying more 
money to the irs?

455
00:21:09,881 --> 00:21:11,070
Numb scores,
right?

456
00:21:11,860 --> 00:21:13,210
But it's like,
but okay,

457
00:21:13,211 --> 00:21:14,044
so,
but yet Bernie's tweet get something 

458
00:21:15,131 --> 00:21:16,510
like 50,000
retweets.

459
00:21:16,510 --> 00:21:18,580
And not that it's all about retweets and
all that,

460
00:21:18,581 --> 00:21:20,710
but it's true.
He has high engagement with this.

461
00:21:20,950 --> 00:21:23,150
But to me it's just lazy thinking.
It's that is lazy.

462
00:21:23,190 --> 00:21:26,080
So virtuous.
If it's so virtuous to keep giving money

463
00:21:26,081 --> 00:21:26,860
to the guts.
Right.

464
00:21:26,860 --> 00:21:28,810
Why do you need the government to tell 
you to do it?

465
00:21:29,150 --> 00:21:29,983
And really at its core,
if you look at the philosophical 

466
00:21:32,171 --> 00:21:35,080
difference between really the culturally
Marxists left,

467
00:21:35,081 --> 00:21:37,720
which is what they're becoming and the 
free thinking,

468
00:21:37,721 --> 00:21:38,800
individualistic,
you know,

469
00:21:38,801 --> 00:21:40,570
individual Libertarian,
conservative,

470
00:21:40,571 --> 00:21:41,404
right?
Which is the new intellectual position 

471
00:21:43,451 --> 00:21:44,620
that is growing,
you know,

472
00:21:44,710 --> 00:21:46,520
quicker than even the left.
It's,

473
00:21:47,110 --> 00:21:49,690
we might want good things to happen in 
society,

474
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:53,560
but don't tell me to do them at gunpoint
and the left on the other hand,

475
00:21:53,710 --> 00:21:55,060
I don't think their intentions are very 
good.

476
00:21:55,061 --> 00:21:56,650
I think they want permanent political 
power.

477
00:21:56,890 --> 00:22:00,310
But Bernie Sanders for example,
he is so convicted that he is right.

478
00:22:00,310 --> 00:22:01,143
He wants to use the absolute authority 
on and unlimited power of the state to 

479
00:22:06,131 --> 00:22:06,964
put a gun to your head and say you have 
to have a 70% tax rate because someone 

480
00:22:10,541 --> 00:22:11,374
is starving on the street.
I would rather live in a society that 

481
00:22:13,241 --> 00:22:16,840
has the same tax rate for everyone,
10% and we dig deep.

482
00:22:16,841 --> 00:22:18,340
We say,
are we going to take care of that person

483
00:22:18,341 --> 00:22:21,220
on the street through charity,
through private philanthropy and through

484
00:22:21,221 --> 00:22:22,054
being better people.
And if you look at when socialism's 

485
00:22:24,580 --> 00:22:25,413
implemented,
you see the moral disintegration of 

486
00:22:28,451 --> 00:22:29,950
society.
You look at Spain,

487
00:22:29,951 --> 00:22:31,360
you look at France,
you look at Europe,

488
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:33,420
they don't have anything as private 
philanthropy anymore.

489
00:22:33,460 --> 00:22:34,293
Private charity has disappeared and 
Europe because government takes care of 

490
00:22:36,521 --> 00:22:37,354
it and that,
I think that is such an important point 

491
00:22:38,981 --> 00:22:39,431
to make.
So,

492
00:22:39,431 --> 00:22:40,264
going back to your question,
how do you illustrate this to a young 

493
00:22:42,221 --> 00:22:42,970
person?

494
00:22:42,970 --> 00:22:46,060
You ask the fundamental question,
do you trust the government?

495
00:22:46,061 --> 00:22:49,730
That word trust is so important because 
then in that word trust,

496
00:22:49,731 --> 00:22:51,220
that really feels personal,
right?

497
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:54,670
Do you trust the government?
99% of young people will say no.

498
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:55,833
Then you ask the next question,
then why do you want to make government 

499
00:22:57,761 --> 00:22:59,530
bigger as soon?
And then they'll say,

500
00:22:59,531 --> 00:23:01,090
I don't.
Well then you're not a social,

501
00:23:01,091 --> 00:23:01,924
so you're not a leftist.
Then let's talk about how we can really 

502
00:23:04,660 --> 00:23:09,520
shrink the size of government and put 
power back into the the hands of people.

503
00:23:09,730 --> 00:23:10,563
And it's important to note also,
even though you think government white 

504
00:23:12,341 --> 00:23:13,174
want might want to do something,
it doesn't mean federal government has 

505
00:23:14,591 --> 00:23:15,424
to do it.
Local government is much more 

506
00:23:17,531 --> 00:23:18,364
accountable to the citizens than some 
bureaucrat in d c that you're never 

507
00:23:21,431 --> 00:23:23,110
going to meet.
And so those are,

508
00:23:23,111 --> 00:23:24,340
those are arguments that,
you know,

509
00:23:24,341 --> 00:23:25,370
we found to be very effective.

510
00:23:25,390 --> 00:23:26,223
Yeah,
it's interesting you mentioned 

511
00:23:26,591 --> 00:23:31,240
intentions and I always try my best not 
to impune intentions of others.

512
00:23:31,390 --> 00:23:33,340
I think that,
especially on the left right now,

513
00:23:33,370 --> 00:23:36,460
obviously I think these people have a 
lot of bad ideas now.

514
00:23:36,461 --> 00:23:38,800
Of course,
some of them have bad intentions,

515
00:23:38,801 --> 00:23:39,634
but most of them don't.
Most average people don't wake up 

516
00:23:41,111 --> 00:23:44,300
thinking I'm going to do bad today.
They actually think they're doing good.

517
00:23:44,301 --> 00:23:45,134
They most of them.
Yeah.

518
00:23:45,230 --> 00:23:48,380
Do you think some of their leaders 
actually have bad intentions?

519
00:23:48,381 --> 00:23:49,250
Without a doubt,
yes,

520
00:23:49,280 --> 00:23:51,020
absolutely.
And not all of them,

521
00:23:51,050 --> 00:23:51,883
but some of them.
And you look back to the original 

522
00:23:53,301 --> 00:23:54,134
writings and the original thought 
process behind the great society and 

523
00:23:56,911 --> 00:23:57,744
Lyndon Baines Johnson who bragged on 
multiple times that the implementation 

524
00:24:00,591 --> 00:24:02,780
of the great society and all the social 
programs around it,

525
00:24:02,990 --> 00:24:03,823
we'll keep African Americans dependent 
and keep them voting for generations 

526
00:24:06,020 --> 00:24:07,910
documented in the presidential record.

527
00:24:08,150 --> 00:24:08,983
Lyndon Baines Johnson said that.
And so I think the Democratic Party is 

528
00:24:11,511 --> 00:24:12,344
full of people with great intentions,
but its leaders have realized and 

529
00:24:15,291 --> 00:24:16,124
calculated.
But if they can keep the government 

530
00:24:17,631 --> 00:24:20,210
programs continuing for just long 
enough,

531
00:24:20,420 --> 00:24:21,253
not getting people out of poverty but 
keep people survive and within poverty 

532
00:24:23,780 --> 00:24:25,550
they will have a permanent political 
base.

533
00:24:25,730 --> 00:24:26,563
So if you ask the question,
if African Americans actually rose out 

534
00:24:29,211 --> 00:24:30,044
of poverty and saw their wages get 
higher and their schools get better and 

535
00:24:33,081 --> 00:24:34,260
their communities,
you know,

536
00:24:34,430 --> 00:24:35,263
flourish,
are they going to keep voting for 

537
00:24:36,441 --> 00:24:39,500
government welfare programs that are the
basis of the Democratic Party?

538
00:24:39,501 --> 00:24:40,970
Absolutely not.
They're not.

539
00:24:40,971 --> 00:24:41,804
They're going to break out of that.
So I think the intentions of the 

540
00:24:43,790 --> 00:24:44,720
Democratic Party,
the followers,

541
00:24:44,721 --> 00:24:45,554
I'm never ever going to impugn them.
I'm not going to call them deplorables 

542
00:24:47,301 --> 00:24:48,134
or anything like they call us.
I think most of the followers of 

543
00:24:49,551 --> 00:24:51,200
Democratic Party actually really good 
people,

544
00:24:51,350 --> 00:24:52,183
but the leaders,
we must question their motives because 

545
00:24:53,661 --> 00:24:58,130
if you look at the failures of the 
welfare system in this country,

546
00:24:58,280 --> 00:24:59,113
it is undoubtable that they're 
protecting a system that benefits them 

547
00:25:01,161 --> 00:25:01,670
politically.

548
00:25:01,670 --> 00:25:05,570
Is this also a partly why the media is 
going so hysterical right now?

549
00:25:05,571 --> 00:25:06,404
Like have you noticed just in the last 
couple of weeks we've shifted a little 

550
00:25:08,781 --> 00:25:09,614
bit out of Russia hysteria,
but now it's about trump's mental 

551
00:25:12,231 --> 00:25:13,064
capacity and they,
and it's like you can see how they 

552
00:25:14,301 --> 00:25:15,260
coordinate it.
I mean,

553
00:25:15,261 --> 00:25:16,610
you really,
if you just look,

554
00:25:16,611 --> 00:25:17,330
you can see you,

555
00:25:17,330 --> 00:25:19,100
they got,
they got like a group text message chain

556
00:25:19,101 --> 00:25:19,881
going,
I'm telling you,

557
00:25:19,881 --> 00:25:22,610
they got like John King,
Anderson Cooper and Don Lemon,

558
00:25:22,611 --> 00:25:24,680
Rachel maddow.
I think they're all just group texting.

559
00:25:24,681 --> 00:25:26,480
I'm not kidding.
I want to have that fear down,

560
00:25:26,481 --> 00:25:28,060
that conspiracy theory.
Can you give me,

561
00:25:28,150 --> 00:25:28,983
when you,
when you start to have all three 

562
00:25:29,751 --> 00:25:32,930
television stations open of CBS this 
morning and CNN,

563
00:25:33,140 --> 00:25:35,060
you know,
with Cuomo and MSNBC,

564
00:25:35,070 --> 00:25:37,190
morning Joe,
and they're talking about the exact same

565
00:25:37,191 --> 00:25:38,024
thing.
Literally the segments are literally 

566
00:25:39,141 --> 00:25:41,170
produced the same.
I don't think that's a conspiracy.

567
00:25:41,300 --> 00:25:42,133
There's gotta be some sort of talking 
points memo they send out early in the 

568
00:25:45,140 --> 00:25:45,973
morning,
but does that actually you were talking 

569
00:25:46,221 --> 00:25:48,290
points memo or just general group thing?
No,

570
00:25:48,291 --> 00:25:49,790
I think it's general group thing,
but I also,

571
00:25:49,791 --> 00:25:52,460
I think they understand that they have 
to be coordinated to be effective,

572
00:25:52,461 --> 00:25:55,310
which there's nothing wrong with that.

573
00:25:55,340 --> 00:25:58,580
Effectively we conserve it as do the 
same thing without even realizing it.

574
00:25:58,581 --> 00:25:59,414
You listened to rush Limbaugh,
you listened to Dennis prager and you 

575
00:26:00,681 --> 00:26:01,514
listen to Sean Hannity.
The talking points are usually quite 

576
00:26:03,771 --> 00:26:04,604
similar because you know,
you watch Fox and friends in the 

577
00:26:06,171 --> 00:26:07,004
morning.
That kind of sets the agenda and I'm 

578
00:26:07,911 --> 00:26:08,744
not,
I'm not attacking the Democrats for 

579
00:26:09,711 --> 00:26:10,544
being that,
but if you look at why the media is 

580
00:26:13,071 --> 00:26:13,904
going so far off the rails,
it's they will never accept the fact 

581
00:26:17,091 --> 00:26:17,924
that this presidency is actually large.
In part a wonderful success is that the 

582
00:26:21,201 --> 00:26:24,110
president is fulfilling his campaign 
promises.

583
00:26:24,350 --> 00:26:25,183
We're seeing unprecedented economic 
prosperity and you're seeing people's 

584
00:26:28,101 --> 00:26:28,934
lives actually get better,
and so they have to go down to this 

585
00:26:31,101 --> 00:26:33,710
tabloid journalism and report on this 
fake book.

586
00:26:34,010 --> 00:26:34,843
They have to continue down this Russia 
hysteria because if this president 

587
00:26:38,150 --> 00:26:39,380
succeeds,
which he is,

588
00:26:39,381 --> 00:26:41,750
and he will,
what else do they have?

589
00:26:41,870 --> 00:26:46,410
They have gone so far in that this guy 
is a psychopathic nutjob.

590
00:26:46,650 --> 00:26:47,483
They will,
they will lose all institutional 

591
00:26:48,421 --> 00:26:50,100
credibility and political relevance.
You know,

592
00:26:50,101 --> 00:26:53,100
it's funny,
right when trump started the campaign,

593
00:26:53,130 --> 00:26:56,090
I kept saying that if you keep calling 
this Guy Hitler,

594
00:26:56,310 --> 00:26:57,143
you are painting yourself into a really 
bad quarter and it cheapens Hitler to 

595
00:27:00,390 --> 00:27:01,223
think about that.
Hitler's was one of the worst mass 

596
00:27:02,971 --> 00:27:06,300
murderers in human history who killed 15
million people,

597
00:27:06,690 --> 00:27:09,390
and they have people once a week on 
those networks,

598
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:11,880
equate him to the rise of the Third 
Reich.

599
00:27:11,881 --> 00:27:16,710
What does that do is it cheapens the 
evil of Hitler and isn't that one of the

600
00:27:16,711 --> 00:27:17,544
worst things you could possibly do when 
we're trying to educate the next 

601
00:27:18,991 --> 00:27:19,970
generation,
everyone's Hitler,

602
00:27:20,010 --> 00:27:20,843
no one's Hitler.
Then maybe what Hitler did wasn't that 

603
00:27:21,991 --> 00:27:22,824
bad.
Maybe Hitler was democratically elected 

604
00:27:23,761 --> 00:27:25,890
and had a supreme court that kept them 
in balance.

605
00:27:25,890 --> 00:27:26,723
You see what I'm saying?
That it cheapens the evil of the Nazi 

606
00:27:29,671 --> 00:27:34,140
empire when they start to make these 
comparisons to Donald Trump and Hitler.

607
00:27:34,210 --> 00:27:35,043
It's really,
and also the way this stuff just goes 

608
00:27:37,051 --> 00:27:37,890
downstream.
I mean,

609
00:27:37,891 --> 00:27:40,740
because then it's you start calling all 
your intellectual opponents Nazis.

610
00:27:40,741 --> 00:27:42,390
Then you say,
it's okay to punch Nazis.

611
00:27:42,391 --> 00:27:43,290
Well,
where does that end?

612
00:27:43,470 --> 00:27:46,110
Can we punch the knots and like life?
Can we blow up their car?

613
00:27:46,111 --> 00:27:46,944
Exactly.
I'm called a Nazi all the time and I 

614
00:27:49,051 --> 00:27:49,884
mean it's one of the most intellectually
just dangerous arguments to make when 

615
00:27:53,791 --> 00:27:54,624
you and when everyone becomes a fascist,
even though there is no evidence of 

616
00:27:58,051 --> 00:27:58,884
that.
What really has your political movement 

617
00:28:01,051 --> 00:28:02,040
become?
Yeah.

618
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:07,230
Where'd the words freedom and liberty 
and the words that I now use a lot,

619
00:28:07,590 --> 00:28:12,240
how did they get so mucked up that they 
started feeling wrong?

620
00:28:12,241 --> 00:28:12,900
You know what I mean?

621
00:28:12,900 --> 00:28:15,240
Or the cultural relevance of things.
Well,

622
00:28:15,270 --> 00:28:16,103
I think,
I think it's starting with the 

623
00:28:17,101 --> 00:28:19,530
misrepresentation of what freedom and 
liberty really is.

624
00:28:19,531 --> 00:28:20,364
I mean,
the left tries to be the movement of 

625
00:28:21,661 --> 00:28:23,790
freedom.
A lot of young people that follow Bernie

626
00:28:23,790 --> 00:28:25,980
Sanders actually think they're on the 
side of freedom.

627
00:28:26,010 --> 00:28:26,843
They think that Bernie Sanders is 
fighting for political freedom and 

628
00:28:29,521 --> 00:28:31,830
economic freedom and that he's going to 
fight for the little guy.

629
00:28:32,190 --> 00:28:34,770
When in reality,
when his ideas are implemented,

630
00:28:34,771 --> 00:28:35,604
which he's an open socialist,
the power always gets concentrated at 

631
00:28:39,241 --> 00:28:41,670
the top.
The rulers are the ones that get rich.

632
00:28:41,820 --> 00:28:43,710
The people that have the best 
connections,

633
00:28:43,830 --> 00:28:46,980
the best lobbyists are the ones that 
benefit tremendously.

634
00:28:47,250 --> 00:28:48,083
You look no further than Venezuela or 
Cuba or anywhere we're socialism has 

635
00:28:51,121 --> 00:28:51,954
tried.
It's the poor people that voted these 

636
00:28:53,131 --> 00:28:55,770
guys in the power that get that are 
worst off.

637
00:28:56,190 --> 00:28:58,020
And so we have to be able to make the 
argument.

638
00:28:58,050 --> 00:29:02,310
Freedom is not only a really cool thing.
Freedom is not only a great idea,

639
00:29:02,520 --> 00:29:03,353
but it actually works like freedom when 
implemented actually makes people's 

640
00:29:06,511 --> 00:29:07,690
lives better.
You know,

641
00:29:07,710 --> 00:29:10,920
freedom would be a difficult argument if
it was not only like really cool to make

642
00:29:10,921 --> 00:29:11,754
the argument like,
yeah,

643
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:13,410
you can do whatever you want to do when 
you want to do it,

644
00:29:13,411 --> 00:29:14,640
how you want to do it,
that would be great.

645
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:17,670
But we actually get to make the argument
that in practicality,

646
00:29:17,730 --> 00:29:22,470
freedom is the greatest thing to make 
people's lives better for innovations,

647
00:29:22,471 --> 00:29:24,690
for medical advances,
for technological,

648
00:29:24,900 --> 00:29:25,890
you know,
prosperity.

649
00:29:25,980 --> 00:29:29,660
Nothing comes even close to allowing 
freedom to,

650
00:29:29,710 --> 00:29:32,460
to ensue.
So what do you say when someone says,

651
00:29:32,461 --> 00:29:33,600
I,
I hear this all the time.

652
00:29:33,601 --> 00:29:34,021
You know,
well,

653
00:29:34,021 --> 00:29:35,670
if the government doesn't do these 
things,

654
00:29:35,671 --> 00:29:36,504
these social programs,
or if the government takes away food 

655
00:29:38,881 --> 00:29:42,070
stamps or whatever it is that just don't

656
00:29:42,070 --> 00:29:46,090
know if the private sector or churches 
and synagogues,

657
00:29:46,091 --> 00:29:46,924
whatever else,
we just don't know that that will pick 

658
00:29:48,791 --> 00:29:51,460
up the slack.
And then if that doesn't happen,

659
00:29:51,640 --> 00:29:55,270
we end up with this permanent class of 
under,

660
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:56,610
uh,
you know,

661
00:29:56,890 --> 00:29:59,910
economically underserved people that 
have no way

662
00:30:00,670 --> 00:30:03,360
fundamentally disagree with that.
And so this is where the world views,

663
00:30:03,370 --> 00:30:07,210
I think collide is where the left,
they try to build this.

664
00:30:07,570 --> 00:30:09,750
I think a lot of it is trying for guilt,
right?

665
00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:12,160
They actually want to help as many 
people as possible.

666
00:30:12,161 --> 00:30:14,080
They feel so bad that people are 
suffering.

667
00:30:14,081 --> 00:30:15,460
They want someone else to do it for 
them.

668
00:30:15,670 --> 00:30:17,250
So the first thing I do is I challenge 
them.

669
00:30:17,260 --> 00:30:18,610
How much money are you giving to 
charity?

670
00:30:18,850 --> 00:30:19,683
How much are you doing?
Actually helped the homeless guy in the 

671
00:30:20,951 --> 00:30:21,784
side corner.
And then what if 10 million people did 

672
00:30:23,141 --> 00:30:24,460
what you did?
Secondly,

673
00:30:24,610 --> 00:30:25,443
never underestimate the good that 
Americans will do when people are in 

674
00:30:29,111 --> 00:30:30,130
need.
Hurricanes,

675
00:30:30,131 --> 00:30:32,950
natural disasters,
famines fires.

676
00:30:33,040 --> 00:30:33,873
Americans always step up.
Americans voluntarily gave $500 billion 

677
00:30:36,941 --> 00:30:39,790
away to charity last year.
Imagine if our tax rate was 10%.

678
00:30:39,970 --> 00:30:40,803
Imagine if there was really a national 
rallying call to double our charitable 

679
00:30:43,451 --> 00:30:43,690
efforts.

680
00:30:43,690 --> 00:30:45,340
We can easily get away trillions of 
dollars.

681
00:30:45,370 --> 00:30:46,630
Wow.
Trillions of dollars.

682
00:30:46,780 --> 00:30:47,613
That's the size of the welfare state.
And I would make a compelling argument 

683
00:30:50,110 --> 00:30:51,550
that local churches,
charities,

684
00:30:51,551 --> 00:30:52,384
and municipalities do a heck of a lot 
better job of serving the people than 

685
00:30:55,541 --> 00:30:57,310
the federal government bureaucrat a lot 
better.

686
00:30:57,550 --> 00:30:59,230
You know,
sending money to Washington DC,

687
00:30:59,240 --> 00:31:02,740
is that actually going to help the poor,
single mother and Miami or it's going to

688
00:31:02,741 --> 00:31:05,110
the local Catholic Church and getting 
$5,000

689
00:31:05,260 --> 00:31:06,093
which might be a lot of money to you 
actually going to help them a lot more 

690
00:31:07,811 --> 00:31:09,910
than sending that $5,000
a Washington DC.

691
00:31:10,150 --> 00:31:14,470
I will argue fiercely against someone 
who says that a government bureaucrat is

692
00:31:14,471 --> 00:31:18,490
going to help an underprivileged 
individual better than a private charity

693
00:31:18,491 --> 00:31:20,020
or individuals helping individuals.

694
00:31:20,540 --> 00:31:23,180
So you said a couple nice things about 
trump.

695
00:31:23,181 --> 00:31:26,140
So I want to get into some of these,
some of the specifics on that please.

696
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:27,073
But,
so one of the things that I've said is 

697
00:31:28,341 --> 00:31:29,174
that trump basically was the bull in the
China shop and he just went in and just 

698
00:31:32,511 --> 00:31:33,344
up and did everything.
And I actually think that right now 

699
00:31:35,150 --> 00:31:35,983
that's a net good because there were a 
lot of bad things happening before and 

700
00:31:38,571 --> 00:31:40,490
there's some fertile ground for good 
idea.

701
00:31:40,491 --> 00:31:41,940
So on that level,
um,

702
00:31:42,220 --> 00:31:43,053
for what's happening,
when I had Eric Weinstein sitting in 

703
00:31:45,021 --> 00:31:45,854
that chair,
he said that he would have preferred it 

704
00:31:46,851 --> 00:31:47,684
to be a panther and a China shop,
meaning it would have just knocked over 

705
00:31:50,301 --> 00:31:51,650
a few things,
maybe not the old.

706
00:31:51,651 --> 00:31:53,590
Sure.
I don't think that that exists.

707
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:55,520
That's,
that was the point of our disagreement.

708
00:31:55,610 --> 00:31:56,443
I just think it just doesn't exist where
you get to selectively choose which 

709
00:31:59,631 --> 00:32:02,660
things are going to be knocked off the 
shelves and all that.

710
00:32:03,500 --> 00:32:06,290
Seb Gorka was speaking at the turning 
point event.

711
00:32:07,080 --> 00:32:08,620
Yeah.
He's here.

712
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:09,473
He really Gutfeld is doing this whole 
thing about how he sounds like somebody 

713
00:32:11,970 --> 00:32:15,110
was doing it on status can stop.
But,

714
00:32:15,111 --> 00:32:15,944
but Corco was saying how trump was the,
I think he said the icebreaker going 

715
00:32:19,131 --> 00:32:20,840
sure.
The glacier basically.

716
00:32:21,050 --> 00:32:23,810
And what I noticed though is there was a
theme with the speakers.

717
00:32:24,050 --> 00:32:27,830
Were everyone basically acknowledged 
that there are issues with trump.

718
00:32:27,831 --> 00:32:28,664
I don't think anyone went up there and 
said this guy is the perfect thing or 

719
00:32:32,020 --> 00:32:33,830
you know,
this is exactly how we wanted it.

720
00:32:34,130 --> 00:32:38,330
But there was a sense of this was the 
only way it could have happened.

721
00:32:38,360 --> 00:32:39,970
Is that where you would,

722
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:42,070
so I'm one of the few,
you know,

723
00:32:42,100 --> 00:32:45,580
outward and vocal millennial trump 
supporters out there.

724
00:32:45,581 --> 00:32:47,780
Not few I should say.
And kind of this word world,

725
00:32:47,781 --> 00:32:50,830
the conservative punditry if you will.
Everyone tries to hedge,

726
00:32:50,831 --> 00:32:51,664
right?
And there's some good and some bad and 

727
00:32:52,630 --> 00:32:53,463
I've obviously gone all in and I'm,
I'm glad I have and I'm happy to walk 

728
00:32:55,661 --> 00:32:56,560
through,
you know,

729
00:32:56,630 --> 00:32:58,090
the philosophical,
you know,

730
00:32:58,120 --> 00:32:58,953
reasoning for that.
So look like Donald Trump was never 

731
00:33:02,141 --> 00:33:03,700
supposed to be present.
United States,

732
00:33:03,820 --> 00:33:07,480
me just look going back a little bit,
running in a crowded field of republican

733
00:33:07,481 --> 00:33:10,900
candidates and announcing the day after 
Jeb Bush announced his candidacy,

734
00:33:10,901 --> 00:33:11,734
which I think was no coincidence,
and I think he saw Jeb Bush announced 

735
00:33:13,871 --> 00:33:15,050
like,
screw it if that guy's running.

736
00:33:15,051 --> 00:33:15,884
Government took down the Bush,
dynasty that out $110 million to spend 

737
00:33:18,851 --> 00:33:19,684
and then took down the Clinton dynasty,
took down the media dynasty in a way 

738
00:33:22,061 --> 00:33:26,560
that's totally unprecedented and if you 
look at the values that he represents,

739
00:33:26,710 --> 00:33:27,543
in my personal opinion,
he is one of the best chances Western 

740
00:33:30,611 --> 00:33:32,110
civilization has to continue.

741
00:33:32,140 --> 00:33:34,630
He believes America's the greatest 
country in the history of the world.

742
00:33:34,870 --> 00:33:37,330
He's been a fierce critic of socialism,
has visit this.

743
00:33:37,331 --> 00:33:42,100
Poland was a 40 minute critique of the 
fall of the USSR.

744
00:33:42,430 --> 00:33:43,263
He believes that the constitution is the
greatest political document ever 

745
00:33:45,701 --> 00:33:46,534
written.
Look no further than his appointment of 

746
00:33:47,411 --> 00:33:50,560
Gorsuch and the circuit court judges,
but more than any of that,

747
00:33:50,710 --> 00:33:53,680
he believes that America as an idea,
it must be preserved,

748
00:33:53,681 --> 00:33:54,820
protected,
and advanced.

749
00:33:55,150 --> 00:33:57,070
And is he an imperfect vessel?
Of course,

750
00:33:57,071 --> 00:33:57,904
we're all imperfect vessels.
Does he tweet things that I might not 

751
00:34:00,191 --> 00:34:01,060
always agree with?
Yeah,

752
00:34:01,090 --> 00:34:02,230
sure.
But,

753
00:34:02,260 --> 00:34:05,290
but the idea is that he's implementing,
I would make a compelling argument.

754
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:07,870
He's the most conservative president in 
a hundred years,

755
00:34:07,871 --> 00:34:08,704
even more so than Ronald Reagan.
He is doing more bold reforms and he's 

756
00:34:11,501 --> 00:34:12,334
fighting to do what he said he was going
to do even in the face of unprecedented 

757
00:34:16,481 --> 00:34:17,314
opposition,
whether it be the embassy moving to 

758
00:34:18,341 --> 00:34:20,920
Jerusalem,
opening up our natural resources,

759
00:34:20,921 --> 00:34:21,754
getting out of TPP,
getting out of the Paris climate court 

760
00:34:23,831 --> 00:34:24,664
agreement.
This is stuff that is not supposed to 

761
00:34:26,381 --> 00:34:27,340
happen.
Right.

762
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:29,860
Do you think Jeb Bush would be doing 
this then and give me a break?

763
00:34:29,861 --> 00:34:30,590
No.
Wait,

764
00:34:30,590 --> 00:34:31,423
so basically,
do you think he was the last chance for 

765
00:34:33,531 --> 00:34:34,364
conservatives say that?
But I kind of think that's a compelling 

766
00:34:37,041 --> 00:34:40,640
argument that know that if you look,
when mccain ran or Romney ran,

767
00:34:40,641 --> 00:34:42,800
Romney was against women with his 
binders of women.

768
00:34:43,100 --> 00:34:43,933
They said,
you know,

769
00:34:43,940 --> 00:34:45,440
mccain was racist,
blah,

770
00:34:45,441 --> 00:34:46,070
blah,
blah.

771
00:34:46,070 --> 00:34:46,903
That to me,
the most compelling argument is that 

772
00:34:48,500 --> 00:34:51,230
none of these guys,
you think Marco Rubio wouldn't be a brow

773
00:34:51,231 --> 00:34:52,064
beat.
Hillary or Jeb would have somehow beat 

774
00:34:53,331 --> 00:34:54,164
Hillary.
So that putting aside some of my 

775
00:34:55,911 --> 00:34:56,744
reservations for a moment,
this was the only way that any of these 

776
00:35:00,141 --> 00:35:01,100
ideas we're going to get.
Yeah,

777
00:35:01,370 --> 00:35:03,840
that's correct.
So we play out the alternative scenario.

778
00:35:03,841 --> 00:35:04,674
Hillary Clinton is president and she has
control of the Senate and control the 

779
00:35:07,741 --> 00:35:08,574
house,
and she's just advancing this radically 

780
00:35:10,081 --> 00:35:12,510
destructive Obama agenda.
Instead,

781
00:35:12,900 --> 00:35:13,733
Donald Trump,
for any of the disagreements people 

782
00:35:15,301 --> 00:35:16,134
might have around him,
the results really speak for themselves 

783
00:35:18,470 --> 00:35:19,303
and the economic prosperity that we're 
seeing right now that you can the $6 

784
00:35:22,500 --> 00:35:24,030
trillion of new wealth created in this 
country.

785
00:35:24,300 --> 00:35:25,920
But even more than that,
I'm telling you,

786
00:35:26,040 --> 00:35:28,830
there was a referendum on the ballot and
I was there and Wisconsin.

787
00:35:28,831 --> 00:35:29,664
I was there in Michigan.
I was there in Pennsylvania with Donald 

788
00:35:30,930 --> 00:35:31,763
Trump jr for weeks on end.
The people that showed up to vote that 

789
00:35:34,840 --> 00:35:35,673
vote in 30 years,
you know what they were really voting 

790
00:35:36,631 --> 00:35:37,464
for?
They were voting that America is the 

791
00:35:39,031 --> 00:35:40,320
greatest country in the history of the 
world.

792
00:35:40,321 --> 00:35:41,154
And here's finally someone who is going 
to fiercely defend it against the 

793
00:35:43,681 --> 00:35:44,970
permanent political class.

794
00:35:44,970 --> 00:35:48,540
That's important because who else to 
represent that permanent political class

795
00:35:48,541 --> 00:35:49,374
than Hillary Clinton?
She was the worst person the Democrats 

796
00:35:51,631 --> 00:35:52,464
could have put up in a change election.
Here's someone who's husband was 

797
00:35:54,841 --> 00:35:57,000
impeached,
who constantly cheated on her.

798
00:35:57,090 --> 00:36:01,950
She's the most uncharismatic possible 
person to put up and here's a guy who,

799
00:36:01,951 --> 00:36:03,360
you know what?
He's going to blow it up.

800
00:36:03,361 --> 00:36:05,010
Great.
That's who I'm gonna vote for.

801
00:36:05,250 --> 00:36:06,083
And you look a lot of what he's doing.
He's sure he has shrunk the size of a 

802
00:36:09,211 --> 00:36:10,044
lot of these federal bureaucracies and 
he's fighting a lot of these entrenched 

803
00:36:13,380 --> 00:36:15,780
media and political establishments that 
honestly,

804
00:36:15,781 --> 00:36:18,030
I never thought we would see such a 
champion against,

805
00:36:18,180 --> 00:36:21,510
which brings me great satisfaction.
What do you think about the intellectual

806
00:36:21,511 --> 00:36:22,344
side of trump?
Like I get what you're saying that the 

807
00:36:23,611 --> 00:36:27,150
broad ideas of freedom to in America and
liberty and those things,

808
00:36:27,390 --> 00:36:30,330
and I basically agree that that's,
he does understand those things.

809
00:36:30,870 --> 00:36:33,870
In terms of just like the intellectual 
or philosophical side,

810
00:36:33,900 --> 00:36:34,733
do you think he really has an 
understanding of the issues or do you 

811
00:36:37,111 --> 00:36:39,390
think that may be isn't even important?
I don't think it's that important.

812
00:36:39,391 --> 00:36:42,300
I've spent considerable time with him 
and his family and I can say this,

813
00:36:42,580 --> 00:36:43,413
his,
his understanding of why America's the 

814
00:36:45,841 --> 00:36:47,280
greatest country in the history of the 
world,

815
00:36:47,430 --> 00:36:51,140
why free enterprise matters and actually
how to benefit country as a whole is,

816
00:36:51,141 --> 00:36:51,974
is just as good,
if not better than some of these 

817
00:36:53,251 --> 00:36:56,310
politicians and might be able to recite 
all these intellectual and philosophical

818
00:36:56,311 --> 00:36:58,650
quotes because this is a president.
But you know what?

819
00:36:58,680 --> 00:36:59,513
He's been through bankruptcy trials,
he's been through hiring and firing 

820
00:37:02,101 --> 00:37:02,934
hundreds of people and you know,
you running a business and me running a 

821
00:37:04,891 --> 00:37:07,020
business that,
that develops character in someone.

822
00:37:07,021 --> 00:37:07,854
You just got to say making payroll,
dealing with regulators minus versus 

823
00:37:11,041 --> 00:37:12,870
some of these senators that have been,
you know,

824
00:37:12,871 --> 00:37:14,490
orders and thinkers their whole life.

825
00:37:14,490 --> 00:37:15,390
Give me a break.
Right?

826
00:37:15,391 --> 00:37:17,610
Yeah.
So I have a deep amount of respect.

827
00:37:17,790 --> 00:37:18,960
It doesn't bother me that,
you know,

828
00:37:18,961 --> 00:37:19,621
CNN says,
oh,

829
00:37:19,621 --> 00:37:21,780
we talks at a fourth grade level.
Give me a break.

830
00:37:21,930 --> 00:37:22,763
You know,
seriously,

831
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:23,633
he talks the way that the guy in 
northeast Iowa has been waiting for 

832
00:37:26,371 --> 00:37:27,204
someone to talk to in awhile.
So I completely dismissed that as an 

833
00:37:29,581 --> 00:37:30,414
argument.
And I look at what he's accomplished as 

834
00:37:31,861 --> 00:37:32,694
a person,
which is totally amazing and what he's 

835
00:37:34,561 --> 00:37:38,370
fighting for every single day.
And he gets the big stuff correct.

836
00:37:38,371 --> 00:37:39,660
He really does.
And I,

837
00:37:39,710 --> 00:37:41,450
and I challenged them on my,
you know,

838
00:37:41,490 --> 00:37:42,323
critics on the right who else in that 
field of 17 Republican candidates would 

839
00:37:45,330 --> 00:37:49,110
have nominated gorsuch to the supreme 
court move the embassy advocated for the

840
00:37:49,111 --> 00:37:49,881
greatest,
you know,

841
00:37:49,881 --> 00:37:52,170
middle class tax cut and American 
history,

842
00:37:52,171 --> 00:37:54,150
not back down on some of these core 
issues.

843
00:37:54,540 --> 00:37:56,250
It's really,
if I would have said,

844
00:37:56,251 --> 00:37:58,620
here's Xyz candidate,
let's just pretend this is,

845
00:37:58,800 --> 00:37:59,633
you know,
in the Republican primary and in the 

846
00:38:00,751 --> 00:38:04,350
first 11 months we'd get this done.
Most conservative pundits would say,

847
00:38:04,351 --> 00:38:05,370
we're at,
where do I sign?

848
00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:06,390
You know,
seriously,

849
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:07,530
you know,
and he's,

850
00:38:07,531 --> 00:38:08,364
he has,
he has advanced more conservative pro 

851
00:38:09,901 --> 00:38:10,734
freedom,
libertarian ideas then any of these 

852
00:38:12,571 --> 00:38:14,160
candidates,
what most of these candidates would.

853
00:38:14,250 --> 00:38:17,340
So then what do you make of the 
conservative class that hates him?

854
00:38:17,460 --> 00:38:20,280
So I'm talking about like the David from
crew,

855
00:38:20,310 --> 00:38:21,143
that that whole French,
the rest of these guys that really just 

856
00:38:24,331 --> 00:38:25,164
hate him.
Even though I agree he has put forth a 

857
00:38:27,691 --> 00:38:28,524
lot of the,
I'm sure they've been yammering about 

858
00:38:29,730 --> 00:38:31,350
for the last 20 years.
I mean,

859
00:38:31,351 --> 00:38:31,960
look,
I,

860
00:38:31,960 --> 00:38:32,793
I,
I have a lot of respect for those 

861
00:38:34,141 --> 00:38:36,910
publications of their history.
I'm just,

862
00:38:36,940 --> 00:38:38,770
I'm challenged to,
I,

863
00:38:38,780 --> 00:38:42,250
I'm really wondering is it a personal 
vendetta they have against this guy?

864
00:38:42,250 --> 00:38:46,270
Is it a personality disagreement?
Because policywise and implementation of

865
00:38:46,271 --> 00:38:48,040
the people he's put in place to make 
decisions,

866
00:38:48,070 --> 00:38:48,903
the cabinet positions,
I mean this is a much more conservative 

867
00:38:51,401 --> 00:38:52,234
president of the George W.
Bush and remarkably more effective than 

868
00:38:54,131 --> 00:38:54,964
hw and already in 12 months,
much more consequential than Ronald 

869
00:38:58,450 --> 00:38:59,091
Reagan.
And,

870
00:38:59,091 --> 00:38:59,900
and so I,
I'm,

871
00:38:59,900 --> 00:39:02,230
I'm wondering,
I w w the ball's in their court,

872
00:39:02,260 --> 00:39:03,093
right,
because to be so hypercritical just 

873
00:39:05,261 --> 00:39:06,094
automatically against someone who is 
fighting for your ideas every single 

874
00:39:08,920 --> 00:39:09,491
day.
I,

875
00:39:09,491 --> 00:39:10,210
I'm just,
I'm,

876
00:39:10,210 --> 00:39:12,820
I'm really wondering why is it,
is it a personality,

877
00:39:12,821 --> 00:39:16,210
this agreement or is it kind of just,
I don't want to be wrong type of thing.

878
00:39:16,211 --> 00:39:19,150
Like I'm cheering for his demise cause 
I'm a po up opposed him for so long.

879
00:39:19,180 --> 00:39:22,000
I think it's also,
I just want to be liked by mainstream,

880
00:39:22,001 --> 00:39:23,050
which,
which is the other thing,

881
00:39:23,051 --> 00:39:24,040
right?
Like I,

882
00:39:24,041 --> 00:39:27,160
I've now created a whole new form of 
enemies I never thought possible,

883
00:39:27,161 --> 00:39:29,830
which is like these rabbit welcome to my
world,

884
00:39:29,860 --> 00:39:30,451
you know,
seriously,

885
00:39:30,451 --> 00:39:32,500
like these rabid media leads that are 
like,

886
00:39:32,501 --> 00:39:33,850
oh,
he's close to the trump people.

887
00:39:33,851 --> 00:39:35,410
We must try to destroy him.
I'm like,

888
00:39:35,411 --> 00:39:36,130
all right,
fine.

889
00:39:36,130 --> 00:39:37,300
Whatever.
You know,

890
00:39:37,360 --> 00:39:40,990
and the hatred for this man is,
is uncalled for.

891
00:39:41,530 --> 00:39:44,230
Is there anything that he's doing that 
you're not happy with?

892
00:39:44,231 --> 00:39:45,310
So I'll give you,
I'll give you this.

893
00:39:45,311 --> 00:39:47,500
That's a great question.
I'll give you something that just in the

894
00:39:47,501 --> 00:39:48,334
last,
and I think you know what you're gonna 

895
00:39:49,160 --> 00:39:50,350
say and I'll probably agree with.
Okay.

896
00:39:50,351 --> 00:39:53,260
So in the last 10 days,
so he basically instructed Jeff sessions

897
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:55,190
we're going to agree on,
okay.

898
00:39:55,420 --> 00:39:57,310
So to me,
states' rights,

899
00:39:57,311 --> 00:39:58,144
if you care about that constitution that
you said he loves so much and all of 

900
00:40:00,371 --> 00:40:01,204
those things,
the states should be able to make laws 

901
00:40:02,831 --> 00:40:03,664
that they want and the federal 
government should not impede on that 

902
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:05,873
story.
We have something called the 10th 

903
00:40:06,491 --> 00:40:07,181
amendment,
et Cetera,

904
00:40:07,181 --> 00:40:09,220
et cetera.
So in a case like this,

905
00:40:09,300 --> 00:40:10,133
what's happening there?
How is there such a disconnect between 

906
00:40:12,611 --> 00:40:13,444
the ideas of freedom that you laid out 
so eloquently and then what sessions is 

907
00:40:17,201 --> 00:40:18,190
doing in practice?

908
00:40:18,430 --> 00:40:19,251
I,
I can't,

909
00:40:19,251 --> 00:40:21,590
I can't explain it well and I won't 
defend it because I don't agree with it.

910
00:40:21,650 --> 00:40:23,720
Look,
I'm a big defender of individual freedom

911
00:40:23,721 --> 00:40:26,960
and liberty and I get a lot of hate from
my social skin are conservative friends.

912
00:40:26,961 --> 00:40:28,820
When I argued for decriminalization of 
drugs,

913
00:40:28,821 --> 00:40:30,620
I've never done drugs in my life and I 
don't plan to,

914
00:40:30,621 --> 00:40:32,600
but someone wants to do it.
Cool,

915
00:40:32,620 --> 00:40:33,453
right?
Whatever,

916
00:40:33,560 --> 00:40:34,393
you know,
put whatever you want to put in your 

917
00:40:34,851 --> 00:40:36,320
body,
as long as it doesn't harm someone else.

918
00:40:36,321 --> 00:40:39,710
So this is something that I think 
actually not making the correct decision

919
00:40:39,711 --> 00:40:40,760
on,
but you know what?

920
00:40:40,820 --> 00:40:43,610
I'm happy to say it.
I've said it publicly and you know,

921
00:40:43,640 --> 00:40:44,473
if I,
if I find someone like jeff sessions 

922
00:40:46,041 --> 00:40:48,200
who's gets most of the stuff right,
he's been great on guns.

923
00:40:48,201 --> 00:40:49,430
He's been great on some of the other 
stuff,

924
00:40:49,431 --> 00:40:51,980
but I don't think he's correct on this,
this marijuana.

925
00:40:51,980 --> 00:40:52,813
She,
and I don't think he's correct 

926
00:40:52,881 --> 00:40:53,714
politically.
It's just the majority of Americans 

927
00:40:55,041 --> 00:40:55,874
don't agree on this issue.
And to go after people that are 

928
00:40:58,191 --> 00:41:01,280
peacefully doing business,
that's really what they're going after.

929
00:41:01,281 --> 00:41:03,910
This is the financial transaction side.
I,

930
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:04,753
that doesn't make a lot of sense to me.
That's not on the correct side of 

931
00:41:06,141 --> 00:41:08,000
economic freedom.
But you know what?

932
00:41:08,240 --> 00:41:10,310
Disagreement is a healthy thing,
right?

933
00:41:10,311 --> 00:41:13,790
And we need to challenge our cabinet 
officials and challenge our leaders when

934
00:41:13,791 --> 00:41:14,624
we don't see eye to eye with them.
And I think this is something that I 

935
00:41:16,071 --> 00:41:20,450
think runs in the face of some of our 
core beliefs and tenants.

936
00:41:20,530 --> 00:41:21,363
Yeah.
It just seems like so ideologically 

937
00:41:22,721 --> 00:41:23,554
inconsistent.
I think it's fighting for states' 

938
00:41:25,361 --> 00:41:27,020
rights.
He's been fighting for states' rights in

939
00:41:27,021 --> 00:41:27,854
that look.
Even now you've got people on the left 

940
00:41:30,130 --> 00:41:32,380
fighting for states' rights.
Ridiculous.

941
00:41:32,381 --> 00:41:33,800
It makes no sense.
Now they're,

942
00:41:33,801 --> 00:41:35,540
they're trying to defend sanctuary 
cities.

943
00:41:35,541 --> 00:41:37,180
So now their phones work doesn't change,
right?

944
00:41:37,181 --> 00:41:38,510
It's going against the federal 
government.

945
00:41:38,511 --> 00:41:39,344
Right.

946
00:41:39,470 --> 00:41:40,280
But,
um,

947
00:41:40,280 --> 00:41:42,860
I will say this,
I think a lot of it is stemmed from this

948
00:41:42,861 --> 00:41:43,694
kind of old holdover war on drugs that 
Ronald Reagan declared in the 1980s 

949
00:41:47,391 --> 00:41:49,340
which was an abysmal and total failure.
Right?

950
00:41:49,341 --> 00:41:51,110
The statistics speak for themselves 
that,

951
00:41:51,280 --> 00:41:52,113
you know,
the war on recreational marijuana has 

952
00:41:54,051 --> 00:41:57,470
not been a net benefit for the taxpayer,
for such society in general.

953
00:41:57,471 --> 00:42:00,020
Again,
I come from the general worldview at the

954
00:42:00,021 --> 00:42:00,854
greatest change does not come through 
government policy or through gum and 

955
00:42:03,411 --> 00:42:05,720
bureaucrats and sort of be 
intellectually consistent.

956
00:42:05,721 --> 00:42:09,080
I want the fend penalizing people that 
are peacefully selling,

957
00:42:09,290 --> 00:42:10,880
you know,
cannabis to other people,

958
00:42:10,881 --> 00:42:13,130
whether it be for medically or 
recreationally and,

959
00:42:13,131 --> 00:42:13,964
but here's the thing,
I want it to high school in northwest 

960
00:42:14,961 --> 00:42:17,000
suburbs of Chicago.
This is the story I always tell people,

961
00:42:17,001 --> 00:42:18,020
say,
Charlie,

962
00:42:18,021 --> 00:42:18,854
your concern,
but how can you possibly hold his 

963
00:42:19,461 --> 00:42:19,790
position?

964
00:42:19,790 --> 00:42:21,230
You know that it's always at these tea 
party groups,

965
00:42:21,231 --> 00:42:22,340
which I love.
I love the tea party.

966
00:42:22,341 --> 00:42:23,210
I love these people,
right?

967
00:42:23,420 --> 00:42:24,340
But they're there.
My,

968
00:42:24,341 --> 00:42:26,150
you know,
I called them like the hardcore group,

969
00:42:26,151 --> 00:42:28,460
right?
Like they're the Alex Jones,

970
00:42:28,461 --> 00:42:29,294
you know,
flag carry and people that are really 

971
00:42:30,651 --> 00:42:32,870
hardcore,
they're really big in the conspiracy and

972
00:42:32,871 --> 00:42:33,590
you know,
there's,

973
00:42:33,590 --> 00:42:34,520
they're always asked me,
Charlie,

974
00:42:34,940 --> 00:42:38,030
how can you possibly be on the side of 
decriminalization of marijuana?

975
00:42:38,031 --> 00:42:38,864
I said,
listen,

976
00:42:38,930 --> 00:42:40,700
I went to high school in the northwest 
suburbs of Chicago.

977
00:42:40,701 --> 00:42:42,500
Okay.
I remember after football games,

978
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:44,900
like kids had backpacks full of 
marijuana.

979
00:42:44,970 --> 00:42:48,350
Now marijuana is illegal in Illinois.
Marijuana is illegal in Cook County.

980
00:42:48,470 --> 00:42:50,450
And there were cops in our halls looking
for it all the time.

981
00:42:50,750 --> 00:42:52,300
It was not working.
Okay,

982
00:42:52,910 --> 00:42:55,220
let's just put it that way.
The kids who wanted it found it.

983
00:42:55,310 --> 00:42:56,930
The kids like me who didn't want you to 
do with it,

984
00:42:56,931 --> 00:42:58,270
just walked away.
What,

985
00:42:58,380 --> 00:43:00,530
what other better illustration of 
freedom than that?

986
00:43:00,650 --> 00:43:02,780
You don't want to engage with it,
just walk away,

987
00:43:02,890 --> 00:43:05,540
find somewhere else to do it.
We didn't need to pay,

988
00:43:05,720 --> 00:43:06,553
you know,
the dea or FBI units to go do locker 

989
00:43:10,071 --> 00:43:13,280
room rates is something that kids were 
recreationally and peacefully doing.

990
00:43:13,281 --> 00:43:14,114
I'm not a proponent of it.
I would support a charity to try to 

991
00:43:15,951 --> 00:43:18,140
educate students not to do it cause I 
think at root,

992
00:43:18,320 --> 00:43:19,153
you know had a net negative,
but why is it government's role to 

993
00:43:20,781 --> 00:43:21,614
social engineer us,
especially when it's a nonlethal 

994
00:43:23,990 --> 00:43:24,750
substance.

995
00:43:24,750 --> 00:43:25,583
I always think it's so interesting like 
look I now I'm in California where it's 

996
00:43:28,381 --> 00:43:33,210
now now recreationally legal,
but I have a medical marijuana card.

997
00:43:33,250 --> 00:43:35,490
Got To hurt my knee playing basketball a
couple of years ago.

998
00:43:35,491 --> 00:43:36,324
The places right over there,
I'd like to walk you in there just to 

999
00:43:38,071 --> 00:43:38,904
see what's going on.
Then before it like you're not going to 

1000
00:43:40,051 --> 00:43:42,930
persuade me to do it,
but I think it's fine.

1001
00:43:42,931 --> 00:43:43,764
Like whatever.
I just think it would be fun to go in 

1002
00:43:44,791 --> 00:43:45,624
there with you.
Yeah.

1003
00:43:45,660 --> 00:43:46,493
That would be what was going on in the 
camp where my mango hat that would not 

1004
00:43:49,830 --> 00:43:53,870
go well in La.
Um,

1005
00:43:54,090 --> 00:43:58,410
but I think it's funny because anytime 
that I ever bought weed illegally,

1006
00:43:58,411 --> 00:43:59,244
like when I lived in New York City and 
just get it from whoever the weed guy 

1007
00:44:01,231 --> 00:44:02,064
was,
I don't even know who the weed guy when 

1008
00:44:02,460 --> 00:44:03,293
exactly,
but I never once in 15 years or 

1009
00:44:05,521 --> 00:44:07,290
whatever,
I never had the guy selling.

1010
00:44:07,291 --> 00:44:08,400
We'd say,
Hey,

1011
00:44:08,430 --> 00:44:10,520
you want to buy crack?
You want to buy coke you.

1012
00:44:10,980 --> 00:44:14,340
And yet we can go to prescription play.
You can go to a psychiatrist,

1013
00:44:14,990 --> 00:44:17,370
push every button rug and it's a hundred
times worse.

1014
00:44:17,420 --> 00:44:18,800
And it's an and it's chemically 
addictive.

1015
00:44:18,830 --> 00:44:19,663
Yeah.
Right.

1016
00:44:19,670 --> 00:44:20,503
So look,
I know plenty of people that have had 

1017
00:44:21,740 --> 00:44:23,030
stories to tell me,
Charlie,

1018
00:44:23,031 --> 00:44:23,864
if it wasn't for medicinal marijuana,
I would have gone to narco substances 

1019
00:44:27,711 --> 00:44:29,690
and I would have been a really a worse 
place.

1020
00:44:29,770 --> 00:44:30,980
Right.
And so fine.

1021
00:44:31,290 --> 00:44:32,123
But that's the core tenant of freedom.
And I think what you're seeing here is 

1022
00:44:34,380 --> 00:44:37,530
most of our turning point followers 
would find sympathy with my argument.

1023
00:44:37,830 --> 00:44:40,500
And this is okay,
this is a natural change and a political

1024
00:44:40,501 --> 00:44:42,750
movement as time goes on.
But,

1025
00:44:42,751 --> 00:44:43,260
and,
and the,

1026
00:44:43,260 --> 00:44:45,180
the fact that jeff sessions holds that 
position,

1027
00:44:45,420 --> 00:44:48,240
maybe he has an experience that I 
haven't experienced,

1028
00:44:48,241 --> 00:44:50,100
right.
That is really personal to him.

1029
00:44:50,101 --> 00:44:51,570
Maybe he's seen,
you know,

1030
00:44:51,571 --> 00:44:52,404
marijuana do something horrible to a 
family member or people in local 

1031
00:44:54,661 --> 00:44:55,560
community,
Alabama.

1032
00:44:55,680 --> 00:44:57,720
I'll disagree with that.
Probably not right.

1033
00:44:57,760 --> 00:44:58,590
But you just have like whatever.

1034
00:44:58,590 --> 00:44:59,423
I'm trying to give the benefit of the 
doubt because I think he's generally a 

1035
00:45:01,201 --> 00:45:02,034
good person.
I always tried to give the benefit of 

1036
00:45:03,061 --> 00:45:04,500
the doubt when people hold these 
positions.

1037
00:45:04,720 --> 00:45:06,630
Um,
I just think it's not the right policy,

1038
00:45:06,631 --> 00:45:07,464
but you know what?
In 20 years you're going to see the 

1039
00:45:08,701 --> 00:45:13,020
conservative libertarian majority 
similar to rand Paul advocate for this.

1040
00:45:13,350 --> 00:45:15,600
And then we'll be able to point out the 
hypocrisy of the left.

1041
00:45:15,601 --> 00:45:16,051
Say,
okay,

1042
00:45:16,051 --> 00:45:16,884
hold on a second.
Like we're cool with people being able 

1043
00:45:19,231 --> 00:45:20,390
to sell it.
They want to sell it long.

1044
00:45:20,391 --> 00:45:21,224
It doesn't harm someone else.
Why are you trying to tell me I can't 

1045
00:45:23,161 --> 00:45:25,170
frack this oil field and the Permian 
Basin?

1046
00:45:25,320 --> 00:45:25,920
Right.
Right.

1047
00:45:25,920 --> 00:45:26,753
If you want to have like an intellect,
if you want to be intellectually 

1048
00:45:28,471 --> 00:45:29,281
consistent,
right?

1049
00:45:29,281 --> 00:45:30,240
Yeah.
All right.

1050
00:45:30,241 --> 00:45:32,550
I want to do one other thing on the 
social stuff and then we'll move over to

1051
00:45:32,551 --> 00:45:33,190
some I'm cool with.

1052
00:45:33,190 --> 00:45:34,290
So I know,
I know.

1053
00:45:34,291 --> 00:45:35,280
I said,
listen,

1054
00:45:35,281 --> 00:45:38,020
I never had like I guess agreements that
you immediately sat down.

1055
00:45:38,050 --> 00:45:39,180
You're like anything,
let's go.

1056
00:45:39,181 --> 00:45:40,980
All right.
Seriously challenged me here we are.

1057
00:45:41,160 --> 00:45:41,993
So,
well I don't think this one will be too 

1058
00:45:43,081 --> 00:45:44,900
much of a challenge,
but I think it's an interesting shirt.

1059
00:45:44,901 --> 00:45:47,210
It just shows how things have shifted.
Um,

1060
00:45:47,250 --> 00:45:48,083
so at the Republican convention,
Peter Teal and openly gay man spoke 

1061
00:45:51,691 --> 00:45:53,700
before trump.
He said,

1062
00:45:53,701 --> 00:45:56,550
I'm a proud gay man,
got a standing ovation.

1063
00:45:56,760 --> 00:45:58,890
Then trump gets up there and talks about
points,

1064
00:45:58,900 --> 00:46:00,990
amount trow right points him and he 
said,

1065
00:46:00,991 --> 00:46:01,824
it makes me very happy.
It was the exact quote he said because 

1066
00:46:03,750 --> 00:46:06,600
he makes me very happy that they with 
the hand,

1067
00:46:06,601 --> 00:46:08,880
but okay.
But that,

1068
00:46:09,090 --> 00:46:12,000
that the fact that there's been such a 
wholesale shift in that,

1069
00:46:12,240 --> 00:46:13,073
that even right now,
ted Cruz or the guys that you might 

1070
00:46:15,631 --> 00:46:17,430
consider a little more of the Christian 
conservatives,

1071
00:46:17,670 --> 00:46:19,230
which I'm one I could be.

1072
00:46:19,230 --> 00:46:19,651
Right.
Okay.

1073
00:46:19,651 --> 00:46:20,484
So,
so where you come from basically as far 

1074
00:46:23,281 --> 00:46:24,114
as I can tell,
don't really see this as an issue 

1075
00:46:25,741 --> 00:46:26,750
anymore.
Is that a fair,

1076
00:46:26,890 --> 00:46:27,723
I think that's correct.
And so let me dive deeper and also pose 

1077
00:46:30,451 --> 00:46:33,030
a hypothetical to some of the leftest 
watching this.

1078
00:46:33,330 --> 00:46:34,163
Peter Teal openly gay man gets a 
standing ovation at the Republican 

1079
00:46:37,050 --> 00:46:38,340
National Convention and then pointed as 
the,

1080
00:46:38,400 --> 00:46:38,790
uh,
you know,

1081
00:46:38,790 --> 00:46:39,623
pointed out by the candidate.
Do you think that an evangelical pastor 

1082
00:46:43,230 --> 00:46:46,590
that was pro Israel that might be a 
Democrat would have even been allowed to

1083
00:46:46,591 --> 00:46:50,010
speak at the Democratic national 
convention or giving a standing ovation?

1084
00:46:50,370 --> 00:46:53,280
They booed God when he was doing that 
was when it was mentioned.

1085
00:46:53,281 --> 00:46:54,370
Okay.
They literally,

1086
00:46:54,550 --> 00:46:55,383
what is the shift here?
The shift is the Republican Party is 

1087
00:46:58,291 --> 00:46:59,910
beginning to realize,
hey,

1088
00:47:00,560 --> 00:47:02,070
we're the party of freedom.
Like,

1089
00:47:02,071 --> 00:47:04,110
it's cool if you want to do that.
And I think it's,

1090
00:47:04,111 --> 00:47:07,350
it's a real sea change because even if 
you see ran Paul big,

1091
00:47:07,390 --> 00:47:08,340
getting to,
you know,

1092
00:47:08,341 --> 00:47:10,170
endorse more of those,
you know,

1093
00:47:10,230 --> 00:47:14,460
favorable drug policy positions on the 
side of freedom or gay marriage,

1094
00:47:14,461 --> 00:47:15,294
you know,
you're starting to see a sea change 

1095
00:47:16,711 --> 00:47:17,544
where it's becoming the sole searching 
the Republican Party as we don't under 

1096
00:47:20,641 --> 00:47:24,480
the last 30 years is what's the one 
thing that ties our party together.

1097
00:47:24,810 --> 00:47:25,980
Freedom,
freedom,

1098
00:47:26,040 --> 00:47:26,873
freedom.
And I think that's why you're starting 

1099
00:47:27,391 --> 00:47:28,590
to see that.
And the left,

1100
00:47:28,591 --> 00:47:31,420
they can't what ties them together.
Oppression.

1101
00:47:31,450 --> 00:47:32,830
You know,
like it's the oppression Olympics.

1102
00:47:32,831 --> 00:47:34,600
It's like who suffers more,
you know?

1103
00:47:34,690 --> 00:47:39,690
And I think that's a really good thing.
Segue to one final point is what I think

1104
00:47:40,121 --> 00:47:40,954
is the position that needs to be 
articulated better is I have no problem 

1105
00:47:44,081 --> 00:47:44,530
if,
you know,

1106
00:47:44,530 --> 00:47:45,430
gay marriage,
whatever,

1107
00:47:45,431 --> 00:47:46,900
like I believe marriage one man,
one woman,

1108
00:47:46,901 --> 00:47:48,310
that's my own personal position,
right?

1109
00:47:48,580 --> 00:47:51,070
But I'm never going to tell government 
to have someone live a life.

1110
00:47:51,071 --> 00:47:52,050
I think it's cool.
You're married,

1111
00:47:52,051 --> 00:47:52,884
I think it's great.
And you should have all the same tax 

1112
00:47:53,561 --> 00:47:54,880
benefits adopt children.
It's great.

1113
00:47:55,210 --> 00:47:56,680
Right.
But you feel the same way about you?

1114
00:47:56,710 --> 00:47:57,101
Well,
it's fine.

1115
00:47:57,101 --> 00:47:57,850
It's like whatever,
like,

1116
00:47:57,850 --> 00:47:58,683
but that's,
that's more of like a generational 

1117
00:47:59,501 --> 00:48:00,334
perspective.
Here's where I think Republican 

1118
00:48:01,320 --> 00:48:03,610
conservatives need to really fight hard.

1119
00:48:03,610 --> 00:48:05,950
And I think you agree as the religious 
liberty stuff is,

1120
00:48:05,951 --> 00:48:06,784
are you going to force a Christian Baker
to make a cake for a gay couple that is 

1121
00:48:11,621 --> 00:48:14,620
not the same thing as being cool with 
gay marriage.

1122
00:48:14,830 --> 00:48:18,040
And the left is trying to make a moral 
equivalency argument of the civil rights

1123
00:48:18,041 --> 00:48:18,874
of the 1960s and someone would having to
violate their religious conscience to 

1124
00:48:24,011 --> 00:48:24,844
make a cake for a gay couple because 
they want to and they want to have 

1125
00:48:27,311 --> 00:48:28,144
fascism where you can go into a private 
company and so you have to produce it 

1126
00:48:32,260 --> 00:48:34,660
product or service because we have a 
certain,

1127
00:48:34,840 --> 00:48:37,330
you know,
lifestyle that's dangerous and wrong.

1128
00:48:37,450 --> 00:48:38,283
And I think that's where the fight needs
to happen and that's where I think we 

1129
00:48:40,901 --> 00:48:41,734
can actually win conference over.
Do you think also the technology is the 

1130
00:48:44,111 --> 00:48:46,870
answer to some of those problems where 
we'd kind of sucks that,

1131
00:48:46,871 --> 00:48:47,704
you know,
I did in my prager u video from last 

1132
00:48:49,240 --> 00:48:50,010
year,
which was excellent.

1133
00:48:50,010 --> 00:48:50,843
Thanks.
I mean that was the line that really 

1134
00:48:51,521 --> 00:48:52,354
caught on because I don't want to force 
that Baker to do something just as if 

1135
00:48:55,811 --> 00:48:57,670
there was a,
um,

1136
00:48:57,730 --> 00:48:58,563
you could use any example here,
but if there was a Jewish artists who 

1137
00:49:00,881 --> 00:49:03,040
had a website that they take commissions
for paintings,

1138
00:49:03,160 --> 00:49:06,160
I wouldn't want the government forcing 
them to paint neo Nazi paintings.

1139
00:49:06,161 --> 00:49:07,630
I mean,
it's exactly the same thing.

1140
00:49:07,660 --> 00:49:09,460
Yeah.
And would you want to force,

1141
00:49:09,640 --> 00:49:10,870
you know,
a Muslim,

1142
00:49:11,260 --> 00:49:14,530
um,
wedding hall to have to host,

1143
00:49:14,800 --> 00:49:16,060
you know,
um,

1144
00:49:16,120 --> 00:49:18,430
someone that is a great critic of Islam,
right?

1145
00:49:18,431 --> 00:49:21,430
That would violate one of the tenants,
one of the pillars of Islam,

1146
00:49:21,431 --> 00:49:22,030
right?
Yeah.

1147
00:49:22,030 --> 00:49:22,863
But for whatever reason,
the left is way overstepping their 

1148
00:49:25,481 --> 00:49:26,314
bounds.
And the circuit court of California was 

1149
00:49:27,851 --> 00:49:28,684
like lost their freaking mind seriously.
Where they don't realize the slippery 

1150
00:49:32,531 --> 00:49:33,364
slope that they're engaging in here 
where if you have a private business 

1151
00:49:36,640 --> 00:49:37,473
with their own private conscience,
they should be allowed to accept and 

1152
00:49:40,571 --> 00:49:42,100
denied business as they see fit.

1153
00:49:42,100 --> 00:49:42,933
Especially if it's business that takes 
preplanning like such as a wedding cake 

1154
00:49:47,470 --> 00:49:48,303
or photography.
The only argument they might make as if 

1155
00:49:50,951 --> 00:49:51,461
you're,
you know,

1156
00:49:51,461 --> 00:49:53,440
running a fast food restaurant,
but you know what,

1157
00:49:53,500 --> 00:49:55,390
if someone wants to be a racist or a 
bigot,

1158
00:49:55,660 --> 00:49:56,493
they have that right.
No one's going to go buy products from 

1159
00:49:58,661 --> 00:49:59,830
them anymore.
Right?

1160
00:49:59,860 --> 00:50:00,693
That's how you win arguments without 
having to use the government gun on 

1161
00:50:03,821 --> 00:50:05,740
people's heads.
Which again,

1162
00:50:05,741 --> 00:50:07,570
I think that's the argument that we have
to make.

1163
00:50:07,571 --> 00:50:10,000
But if look,
if a gay couple wants to get married,

1164
00:50:10,001 --> 00:50:11,080
that's cool.
Like whatever.

1165
00:50:11,110 --> 00:50:13,930
That's the law of the land.
Move on to bigger battles like religious

1166
00:50:13,931 --> 00:50:15,010
liberty and freedom.
All right,

1167
00:50:15,011 --> 00:50:17,230
let's shift a little bit to some 
religion.

1168
00:50:17,260 --> 00:50:19,810
Okay.
You are a Christian conservative.

1169
00:50:19,811 --> 00:50:20,644
That's correct.
Just that phrase triggers a certain 

1170
00:50:23,411 --> 00:50:24,610
amount of people.
So first off,

1171
00:50:24,611 --> 00:50:26,260
what,
what is a Christian conservative?

1172
00:50:26,420 --> 00:50:28,130
Which always,
which always stuns me.

1173
00:50:28,131 --> 00:50:30,080
So I do a lot of campus too.
Or I'll tell you a quick story.

1174
00:50:30,081 --> 00:50:30,914
A lot of campus tours,
and I go through my litany of what I 

1175
00:50:32,241 --> 00:50:35,360
call hard truths told by Charlie Kirk.
And I'll say,

1176
00:50:35,590 --> 00:50:36,423
you know,
socialism is the greatest killer of 

1177
00:50:37,281 --> 00:50:38,114
humanity in the last 100 years.
And I'll say free enterprise is the 

1178
00:50:40,281 --> 00:50:41,114
greatest economic system ever.
And then I'll say three words and it 

1179
00:50:43,071 --> 00:50:46,610
drives them so crazy.
I say God is real.

1180
00:50:46,940 --> 00:50:50,180
And it's like they just start shaking.
Then the left,

1181
00:50:50,181 --> 00:50:51,014
they think they don't,
they don't know how to handle it and 

1182
00:50:52,131 --> 00:50:54,050
half the place loves it.
Half the place hates it.

1183
00:50:54,230 --> 00:50:58,070
I don't know why that's so triggering.
So I'm a Christian first and foremost.

1184
00:50:58,071 --> 00:50:59,960
I believe Jesus Christ is the son of 
God.

1185
00:50:59,961 --> 00:51:01,610
And he came down and we,
you know,

1186
00:51:01,611 --> 00:51:02,444
he died for all our sins and we have a 
good documentation of that and we could 

1187
00:51:05,211 --> 00:51:06,290
debate and discuss that,
whatever.

1188
00:51:06,290 --> 00:51:07,670
But as a Christian,
I'm,

1189
00:51:07,700 --> 00:51:08,780
you know,
I believe that,

1190
00:51:08,920 --> 00:51:09,753
you know,
we are called to try to advance the 

1191
00:51:13,490 --> 00:51:14,990
Kingdom of God and the Ministry of Jesus
Christ as many people as possible and as

1192
00:51:15,050 --> 00:51:16,460
peacefully as possible,
obviously.

1193
00:51:16,461 --> 00:51:17,294
Right?
So that's how I try to live my own 

1194
00:51:18,111 --> 00:51:21,470
personal life and make my own personal 
decisions as a conservative,

1195
00:51:21,471 --> 00:51:22,304
I'd say,
let me go ahead.

1196
00:51:23,010 --> 00:51:26,840
I don't see you proselytizing religion 
though in the public way.

1197
00:51:26,930 --> 00:51:28,430
I,
I've heard you speak before.

1198
00:51:28,431 --> 00:51:29,970
Sure.
And I've never heard you pushed that.

1199
00:51:29,990 --> 00:51:32,690
So I say it every so often when,
when asked,

1200
00:51:32,691 --> 00:51:35,900
but I look at my speaking no different 
than sometimes doing a job,

1201
00:51:35,901 --> 00:51:37,100
right?
So a plumber,

1202
00:51:37,101 --> 00:51:37,934
electrician,
that is not going to tell every person 

1203
00:51:39,051 --> 00:51:40,880
he turns around the corner like,
Hey,

1204
00:51:40,881 --> 00:51:43,250
have you heard the name of Jesus Christ?
You know what I mean?

1205
00:51:43,251 --> 00:51:44,084
So you have to,
you don't want to be two offsetting and 

1206
00:51:45,501 --> 00:51:46,010
off putting.

1207
00:51:46,010 --> 00:51:47,840
But I also try to,
you know,

1208
00:51:47,841 --> 00:51:49,340
through my,
some of my platforms,

1209
00:51:49,580 --> 00:51:51,110
you know,
talk about my personal beliefs,

1210
00:51:51,111 --> 00:51:53,180
no matter how triggering it might be to 
other people.

1211
00:51:53,270 --> 00:51:54,950
And I'm like campus tours.
I try to,

1212
00:51:55,190 --> 00:51:55,860
you know,
advance,

1213
00:51:55,860 --> 00:51:57,650
but of course I could probably do a 
better job of it.

1214
00:51:57,651 --> 00:51:59,290
But with that being said,
um,

1215
00:51:59,390 --> 00:52:01,550
I would consider myself more as a 
conservatorium,

1216
00:52:01,850 --> 00:52:05,120
which I find to be a new breed of,
you know,

1217
00:52:05,180 --> 00:52:06,740
ideology,
which you and I talked about.

1218
00:52:06,741 --> 00:52:09,620
And some people have already been 
labeling themselves as such.

1219
00:52:09,621 --> 00:52:10,454
And I find no contradiction between my 
Christian worldview and my political 

1220
00:52:14,661 --> 00:52:15,530
philosophy.
In fact,

1221
00:52:15,531 --> 00:52:16,940
I find,
um,

1222
00:52:16,970 --> 00:52:18,040
great amount of,
you know,

1223
00:52:18,050 --> 00:52:18,883
synchrony actually between what I find,
what I believe theologically and what I 

1224
00:52:22,161 --> 00:52:24,350
believe spiritually and religiously,
um,

1225
00:52:24,380 --> 00:52:25,213
to also what I advocate for politically,
which is essentially the nonaggression 

1226
00:52:28,611 --> 00:52:29,444
principle.
And,

1227
00:52:29,540 --> 00:52:30,373
you know,
believing in productive people in free 

1228
00:52:32,181 --> 00:52:35,540
societies should be able to make your 
choices as you see fit as long as you're

1229
00:52:35,541 --> 00:52:36,530
not harming someone else.

1230
00:52:37,010 --> 00:52:42,010
How did Christians and up as so much of 
the butt of what the left hates?

1231
00:52:43,140 --> 00:52:47,120
Because you can open up every day 
another buzzfeed article mocking,

1232
00:52:47,121 --> 00:52:47,890
isn't it?
Right,

1233
00:52:47,890 --> 00:52:51,290
Chris genomes and Mike and huff po and 
the,

1234
00:52:51,680 --> 00:52:52,790
they all love me,
but boy,

1235
00:52:52,970 --> 00:52:53,803
oh yeah,
they must,

1236
00:52:53,830 --> 00:52:54,890
they must.
The fact that I'm a,

1237
00:52:55,130 --> 00:52:56,000
yeah,
it's nuts.

1238
00:52:56,120 --> 00:52:58,340
Um,
but how did that happen?

1239
00:52:58,520 --> 00:52:59,353
Well,
so I think what happened is that 

1240
00:53:01,100 --> 00:53:04,970
Christian conservatives fell for a trap 
that they really should have rejected,

1241
00:53:05,360 --> 00:53:09,800
which is we might hold these truths very
near and dear to our heart,

1242
00:53:09,860 --> 00:53:12,220
theologically and biblically and 
spiritually,

1243
00:53:12,240 --> 00:53:13,073
religiously.
But I think where the line was crossed 

1244
00:53:15,261 --> 00:53:16,094
is in the sixties and seventies and 
eighties where we tried to impose those 

1245
00:53:19,401 --> 00:53:20,234
beliefs through government policy where 
people then inherently have a rejection 

1246
00:53:23,811 --> 00:53:24,441
to it.
Similarly,

1247
00:53:24,441 --> 00:53:28,350
how people are the left and posing their
crazy worldview upon us.

1248
00:53:28,440 --> 00:53:29,273
Right?
I think that was a big mistake because 

1249
00:53:30,901 --> 00:53:32,700
it created this kind of counter 
revolution,

1250
00:53:32,701 --> 00:53:33,534
which is,
I don't want to have to live the way 

1251
00:53:34,831 --> 00:53:36,870
some Christian and Alabama wants me to 
live.

1252
00:53:37,110 --> 00:53:38,420
Does that make sense?
So like it's,

1253
00:53:38,430 --> 00:53:41,520
it's the imposition of those values 
through legislation and government,

1254
00:53:41,820 --> 00:53:43,920
which is something I don't necessarily 
support,

1255
00:53:43,921 --> 00:53:46,380
right?
So I try to always advocate for everyone

1256
00:53:46,381 --> 00:53:47,214
in my political positions through a 
secular worldview because that is the 

1257
00:53:50,431 --> 00:53:52,500
vast majority of people.
And that's the actual,

1258
00:53:52,501 --> 00:53:54,490
the government system that we have.
All you know,

1259
00:53:54,560 --> 00:53:55,393
decided to create,
we do have a separation of church and 

1260
00:53:56,791 --> 00:53:59,640
state and we should support that.
With that being said,

1261
00:53:59,641 --> 00:54:02,400
I can still have my own personal 
opinions and my own personal,

1262
00:54:02,640 --> 00:54:03,680
you know,
um,

1263
00:54:03,720 --> 00:54:04,553
ways to go about changing public policy.
But when we start to say we should 

1264
00:54:08,251 --> 00:54:10,800
support this law because it's the 
Christian thing to do,

1265
00:54:10,920 --> 00:54:13,650
that is,
I think beginning that has turned people

1266
00:54:13,651 --> 00:54:14,484
off for the last 30 years.
What does it say also about Christians 

1267
00:54:17,311 --> 00:54:17,671
that,
you know,

1268
00:54:17,671 --> 00:54:21,240
we talked about gay marriage before that
there was a shift.

1269
00:54:21,310 --> 00:54:22,980
Sure.
There actually has been a shift.

1270
00:54:22,981 --> 00:54:26,460
Now you're basically arguing it's a 
political shift or utilitarian.

1271
00:54:26,510 --> 00:54:27,210
Yes.
You're just,

1272
00:54:27,210 --> 00:54:29,370
you're sort of giving me just the 
realist argument.

1273
00:54:29,390 --> 00:54:30,223
Yeah.
But is there something else going on 

1274
00:54:31,801 --> 00:54:33,100
there too,
where there is some,

1275
00:54:33,150 --> 00:54:33,961
could be,
I mean,

1276
00:54:33,961 --> 00:54:36,000
the tolerance to tolerance in the truest
sense.

1277
00:54:36,250 --> 00:54:37,083
And here this is the other problem with 
Christians and me being a card carrying 

1278
00:54:40,051 --> 00:54:44,460
member of this community and I try my 
hardest and I fail is,

1279
00:54:44,550 --> 00:54:47,910
and I'm around a lot of these Christians
and I sometimes fall into it.

1280
00:54:47,911 --> 00:54:49,260
It's this legalism,
right,

1281
00:54:49,440 --> 00:54:52,040
is that I'm somehow better than you 
because I'm a Christian.

1282
00:54:52,080 --> 00:54:55,740
And I really think that's done such a 
disservice to the Christian community,

1283
00:54:55,741 --> 00:54:57,660
especially the Christian conservative 
community.

1284
00:54:57,930 --> 00:54:58,763
It's the sanctimonious approach to 
lifestyle that I find to be really off 

1285
00:55:02,401 --> 00:55:04,500
putting to a lot of non believers.

1286
00:55:04,770 --> 00:55:05,790
And people say,
well,

1287
00:55:05,791 --> 00:55:07,770
I don't want to be a Christian because 
they're always going to talk down to me,

1288
00:55:07,771 --> 00:55:09,330
or they're gonna make me live by this 
set of beliefs.

1289
00:55:09,331 --> 00:55:12,420
So they think they're better than I am.
It's a number one critique I get.

1290
00:55:12,421 --> 00:55:13,320
It's not that,
oh,

1291
00:55:13,321 --> 00:55:15,210
I don't believe Jesus Christ is actually
the son of God,

1292
00:55:15,211 --> 00:55:16,650
or I don't believe the Bible.
You know,

1293
00:55:16,651 --> 00:55:18,870
those are actually things I think that 
can be ironed out.

1294
00:55:19,140 --> 00:55:22,410
It's more so like I've always been 
talked down to or why when I was a young

1295
00:55:22,411 --> 00:55:23,244
kid,
I was in Catholic school and they gave 

1296
00:55:23,821 --> 00:55:24,654
me these 15 things I couldn't do.
And because of that I rebelled and 

1297
00:55:26,371 --> 00:55:29,430
rejected.
So I think this idea that actually Jesus

1298
00:55:29,430 --> 00:55:30,630
Christ advocated for,
which is,

1299
00:55:30,840 --> 00:55:33,120
hey,
I dined with the tax collectors.

1300
00:55:33,121 --> 00:55:35,220
I was best friends with the prostitutes,
right?

1301
00:55:35,370 --> 00:55:39,720
Like I never thought that they were any 
better than the my disciples.

1302
00:55:39,900 --> 00:55:40,531
Right.
And I,

1303
00:55:40,531 --> 00:55:42,810
and of course I don't live this out the 
best I should,

1304
00:55:43,050 --> 00:55:44,820
but we're Christians have gotten it 
wrong.

1305
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:47,940
Is this fierce fire and Brimstone 
legalist,

1306
00:55:48,120 --> 00:55:50,130
thou shall all homosexual.
You know,

1307
00:55:50,131 --> 00:55:51,480
like that's wrong,
man.

1308
00:55:51,750 --> 00:55:54,480
That's not,
that's not what the,

1309
00:55:54,481 --> 00:55:55,314
the,
the teachings and the evidence we have 

1310
00:55:56,581 --> 00:55:59,610
of Jesus Christ's life ever taught us.
He was welcoming,

1311
00:55:59,611 --> 00:56:01,200
he was tolerant,
he was accepting,

1312
00:56:01,320 --> 00:56:02,153
he had standards.
He was fierce when it came to eternity 

1313
00:56:04,381 --> 00:56:05,214
in the standards of God.
But he wasn't afraid to go chill with 

1314
00:56:07,351 --> 00:56:08,184
tax collectors,
which were considered like the lowest 

1315
00:56:10,410 --> 00:56:14,010
form of individual possible in the 
Middle East during that time.

1316
00:56:14,310 --> 00:56:17,130
And so I think we as Christians can 
learn a lot of that in modern society.

1317
00:56:17,220 --> 00:56:18,053
And when we wrap this thing up,
you want to go have lunch with some 

1318
00:56:19,400 --> 00:56:20,880
prostitutes.
I mean,

1319
00:56:20,881 --> 00:56:23,380
if they want to hear about the good news
of Jesus Christ,

1320
00:56:24,740 --> 00:56:25,590
even so,
right?

1321
00:56:25,610 --> 00:56:27,250
He's sometimes,
some people are like,

1322
00:56:27,340 --> 00:56:28,060
oh,
you know,

1323
00:56:28,060 --> 00:56:32,080
but the point being is we should,
we as Christians have to do a better job

1324
00:56:32,440 --> 00:56:36,910
of not being the sanctimonious moral 
conjectures,

1325
00:56:36,940 --> 00:56:38,890
which we get labeled at summit and so 
much

1326
00:56:39,150 --> 00:56:39,983
so when you see a guy like Shapiro or a 
guy like prager prager's more than my 

1327
00:56:43,681 --> 00:56:44,514
heroes,
prager basically a secular Jew at this 

1328
00:56:46,141 --> 00:56:47,910
point,
but grew up Orthodox Shapiro,

1329
00:56:47,911 --> 00:56:49,770
obviously observant,
religious,

1330
00:56:49,780 --> 00:56:52,560
there've been orthodox Jew,
you guys basically,

1331
00:56:52,561 --> 00:56:53,394
from what I can tell,
agree on pretty much everything 

1332
00:56:55,231 --> 00:56:57,540
politically.
You're obviously more trump than then.

1333
00:56:57,541 --> 00:56:59,910
Shapiro isn't.
I think it's pretty on any given day,

1334
00:56:59,911 --> 00:57:02,220
prager definitely is more pro trump,
but does,

1335
00:57:02,221 --> 00:57:04,590
does any of your religious differences 
does,

1336
00:57:04,591 --> 00:57:06,720
I know that doesn't matter to you in 
terms of policy,

1337
00:57:06,721 --> 00:57:07,554
that's very obvious,
but just in terms of like your humanity 

1338
00:57:10,381 --> 00:57:13,200
or the way your worldview,
does any of that matter to you?

1339
00:57:13,640 --> 00:57:14,473
I've had wonderful discussions.
It's Dennis prager about what he 

1340
00:57:17,781 --> 00:57:19,760
believes theologically and I mean,
look,

1341
00:57:19,761 --> 00:57:20,594
first of all,
I think Dennis prager is like the Yoda 

1342
00:57:22,970 --> 00:57:24,860
of the conservative movement.
He's like unbelievably brilliant.

1343
00:57:25,400 --> 00:57:26,540
Isn't that?
I know exactly.

1344
00:57:26,730 --> 00:57:27,590
He,
he's,

1345
00:57:27,591 --> 00:57:29,300
he's fantastic.
And same with Ben.

1346
00:57:29,301 --> 00:57:31,010
I mean,
I listen to their stuff every single day

1347
00:57:31,011 --> 00:57:34,790
and prager university does a heroic job,
but it doesn't bother me at all.

1348
00:57:34,791 --> 00:57:36,100
But I'm,
I always challenged.

1349
00:57:36,101 --> 00:57:37,990
Right?
So I challenge,

1350
00:57:38,050 --> 00:57:38,751
um,
you know,

1351
00:57:38,751 --> 00:57:42,350
religious and observant Jews with some 
pretty good questions.

1352
00:57:42,351 --> 00:57:43,184
I think because I'm very big into 
apologetics of the New Testament in the 

1353
00:57:45,861 --> 00:57:47,060
Christian,
you know,

1354
00:57:47,090 --> 00:57:49,280
the evidence for Christianity.
I ask questions,

1355
00:57:49,281 --> 00:57:52,130
I'll say,
and then do you believe Paul existed in,

1356
00:57:52,570 --> 00:57:54,800
do you think Paula Saaris existed?
And they'll say,

1357
00:57:54,801 --> 00:57:56,300
yes,
I'll say it doesn't do anything.

1358
00:57:56,301 --> 00:57:57,134
It's kind of like weird that a Roman Jew
dropped his whole amazing lifestyle and 

1359
00:58:01,340 --> 00:58:04,910
like went all in for this Jesus Christ 
thing and then got persecuted,

1360
00:58:04,911 --> 00:58:05,744
put in jail six times and then reverse 
crucified like with someone do that if 

1361
00:58:08,541 --> 00:58:10,160
they actually didn't believe this.

1362
00:58:10,310 --> 00:58:12,020
That's a provocative question obviously.
Right?

1363
00:58:12,021 --> 00:58:14,540
But I love that and I love that kind of,
you know,

1364
00:58:15,240 --> 00:58:16,460
um,
discussion and look,

1365
00:58:16,461 --> 00:58:18,230
Paul said very clearly in the New 
Testament,

1366
00:58:18,231 --> 00:58:19,160
blessed the Jews.
You know,

1367
00:58:19,161 --> 00:58:21,430
these are your brothers.
There is no new testament,

1368
00:58:21,540 --> 00:58:22,970
the old testament.
So we agree,

1369
00:58:23,080 --> 00:58:24,680
you know,
with the Jewish people and all that.

1370
00:58:24,710 --> 00:58:25,543
And look,
I think we need more Jews to actually 

1371
00:58:27,711 --> 00:58:28,544
become more observant and to understand 
the roots of the Torah and the roots of 

1372
00:58:32,240 --> 00:58:35,720
what God commanded through Moses and 
through David and the,

1373
00:58:35,721 --> 00:58:36,554
the major and minor prophets.
And I have such great respect for them 

1374
00:58:39,051 --> 00:58:41,510
because they've done a great job of I 
think awakening,

1375
00:58:41,810 --> 00:58:43,730
um,
people that there are,

1376
00:58:43,820 --> 00:58:44,653
you know,
Jewish conservatives out there and it's 

1377
00:58:45,921 --> 00:58:47,090
okay to believe these things.

1378
00:58:47,180 --> 00:58:48,440
Well,
it's interesting because there's someone

1379
00:58:48,441 --> 00:58:50,960
that doesn't come from this from a 
religious perspective.

1380
00:58:51,260 --> 00:58:54,200
I agree with the wider principle that 
you're pushing here,

1381
00:58:54,201 --> 00:58:56,330
which is that some of these minority 
communities.

1382
00:58:56,331 --> 00:58:57,650
So in this case you're talking about 
Jews,

1383
00:58:57,860 --> 00:58:58,693
but you referenced black people earlier,
which I want to talk a little bit about 

1384
00:59:00,621 --> 00:59:02,410
capital working with candice.
Um,

1385
00:59:02,450 --> 00:59:04,490
but now I see it with the Asian 
community.

1386
00:59:04,700 --> 00:59:06,560
I don't know if you just saw it in the 
last couple of days.

1387
00:59:06,561 --> 00:59:11,420
There's this email that got leaked from 
Google where they basically were saying,

1388
00:59:11,421 --> 00:59:12,254
we're going to hire people but not white
men or Asian women will be treated like 

1389
00:59:15,921 --> 00:59:17,600
white women or something.
Something to that effect.

1390
00:59:17,601 --> 00:59:22,060
Like this lunacy horribly racist.
It's the real race

1391
00:59:22,370 --> 00:59:25,070
and racism though.
It's this kind of like,

1392
00:59:25,520 --> 00:59:27,590
it's just there's this ranking of 
oppression.

1393
00:59:27,591 --> 00:59:28,424
Olympics,
like some of your skin color makes you 

1394
00:59:29,571 --> 00:59:31,010
somewhat more,
you know,

1395
00:59:31,520 --> 00:59:32,353
worthy of a position in the company or 
in a university because you've been 

1396
00:59:35,871 --> 00:59:36,704
through more.
Just because you look different or the 

1397
00:59:37,791 --> 00:59:38,624
scary part,
especially for the Asian community is 

1398
00:59:39,951 --> 00:59:43,610
that your skin color and the way you 
look is it makes you less worthy because

1399
00:59:43,611 --> 00:59:44,444
you're going to work real hard and 
you're going to hack the right 

1400
00:59:46,260 --> 00:59:48,170
decisions.
I mean,

1401
00:59:48,171 --> 00:59:49,004
make no mistake.
It's like an anti Asian American 

1402
00:59:51,140 --> 00:59:54,010
worldview that the left has now 
essentially embraced.

1403
00:59:54,020 --> 00:59:54,321
It's like,
Oh,

1404
00:59:54,321 --> 00:59:57,100
they've been successful enough.
Now we must discriminate against them so

1405
00:59:57,110 --> 00:59:58,530
we can help the,
it's like it's,

1406
00:59:58,590 --> 01:00:00,020
it's,
it's lunacy.

1407
01:00:00,021 --> 01:00:00,854
But going back to your point of the 
Christian conservative kind of 

1408
01:00:03,530 --> 01:00:04,940
Worldview,
I think that there's a lot,

1409
01:00:05,060 --> 01:00:08,750
there's a lot of us that hold these 
beliefs very personal.

1410
01:00:08,990 --> 01:00:09,823
But also that's,
that's kind of where we draw the line 

1411
01:00:11,031 --> 01:00:11,451
is,
and you know,

1412
01:00:11,451 --> 01:00:12,284
we have these personal beliefs and 
they're gonna dictate how we want to 

1413
01:00:14,031 --> 01:00:14,864
live individually.
But how do we advocate for a society 

1414
01:00:17,870 --> 01:00:21,340
that allows the most amount of people to
advocate for their own personal beliefs,

1415
01:00:21,350 --> 01:00:23,450
whatever they might be,
as long as it doesn't harm someone else.

1416
01:00:23,600 --> 01:00:25,850
So your basic argument,
and I think you hit on this a little bit

1417
01:00:25,851 --> 01:00:26,684
earlier,
would be that the part of the reason 

1418
01:00:28,581 --> 01:00:31,750
that Europe is crumbling,
which is crumbling,

1419
01:00:31,780 --> 01:00:33,890
the West is crumbling except for 
America.

1420
01:00:33,920 --> 01:00:34,581
Yeah.
I mean,

1421
01:00:34,581 --> 01:00:35,750
we're,
so we're taping this,

1422
01:00:35,751 --> 01:00:38,570
it's going to go up next week,
but we're taping this today is the three

1423
01:00:38,571 --> 01:00:42,040
year anniversary of Charlie Hebdo was a 
couple of years ago,

1424
01:00:42,050 --> 01:00:42,883
three years.
But today was the day that they finally 

1425
01:00:43,911 --> 01:00:44,744
caught the guy,
and then there was the shooting at the 

1426
01:00:46,130 --> 01:00:47,930
Kosher supermarket entire summers and 
all that.

1427
01:00:48,080 --> 01:00:50,960
Today a different supermarket was burned
down.

1428
01:00:50,990 --> 01:00:51,823
I mean,
this is,

1429
01:00:51,830 --> 01:00:54,350
this is still happening in Paris right 
now.

1430
01:00:54,650 --> 01:00:56,210
Uh,
and this is happening all across Europe.

1431
01:00:56,211 --> 01:00:57,470
We know what's going on in Sweden.
All this,

1432
01:00:57,710 --> 01:00:58,543
your basic premise would be that if they
had held on to some of their 

1433
01:01:01,671 --> 01:01:04,220
judeochristian values instead of trading
them in,

1434
01:01:04,450 --> 01:01:08,070
or what,
what do you think is essentially statism

1435
01:01:08,090 --> 01:01:10,340
right.
But yet you're also a secularist,

1436
01:01:10,341 --> 01:01:12,020
which is an interesting,
I don't think it's not,

1437
01:01:12,080 --> 01:01:12,913
I don't think it's contradictory because
I would make an argument that actually 

1438
01:01:14,721 --> 01:01:18,050
the separation of church and State found
in America has helped the church.

1439
01:01:18,440 --> 01:01:21,170
We still have the highest churchgoing 
greats rates in the west.

1440
01:01:21,260 --> 01:01:22,093
We still have the highest levels of 
private philanthropy have more churches 

1441
01:01:23,901 --> 01:01:24,734
opening than ever before.
The evangelical community is growing in 

1442
01:01:26,841 --> 01:01:28,820
most states,
as Alan Dershowitz would say,

1443
01:01:28,821 --> 01:01:31,340
the separation church and state has been
the best thing for the church.

1444
01:01:31,660 --> 01:01:33,800
Uh,
because it's not imposed upon people.

1445
01:01:33,801 --> 01:01:36,530
It's not mandatory.
As you and I both agree,

1446
01:01:36,650 --> 01:01:38,930
when as soon as you start to tell 
someone to do something,

1447
01:01:38,931 --> 01:01:40,550
it becomes a lot less sexy and 
appealing.

1448
01:01:40,900 --> 01:01:43,160
It actually want to rebel against it.
You want to reject it.

1449
01:01:43,400 --> 01:01:44,233
I would argue Europe through their 
social welfare programs have 

1450
01:01:47,391 --> 01:01:50,330
deteriorated the church be as soon as 
they start to say,

1451
01:01:50,331 --> 01:01:51,950
government is going to take care of 
people,

1452
01:01:52,160 --> 01:01:54,680
government is going to be the most 
important thing in your life.

1453
01:01:54,681 --> 01:01:58,790
Government's gonna fix these vastly 
complex social problems.

1454
01:01:59,030 --> 01:02:02,480
Then all of a sudden the church and the 
individual becomes far less significant.

1455
01:02:02,481 --> 01:02:04,730
As Dennis prager says,
the larger the government,

1456
01:02:04,731 --> 01:02:05,564
the smaller the citizen,
and you're seeing that play out in 

1457
01:02:06,951 --> 01:02:07,784
France and Spain and Portugal and Italy 
where you have individual philanthropy 

1458
01:02:11,091 --> 01:02:13,010
disappeared,
where you have business startups,

1459
01:02:13,190 --> 01:02:15,230
ness totally evaporate.

1460
01:02:15,440 --> 01:02:16,273
And the final point is what it really 
lends itself to is more dangerous 

1461
01:02:19,441 --> 01:02:22,410
ideologies to take forms such as radical
Islam,

1462
01:02:22,650 --> 01:02:23,483
which is I think one of the most 
dangerous widespread ideological 

1463
01:02:27,061 --> 01:02:29,490
movements happening in the West that no 
one is talking about.

1464
01:02:29,790 --> 01:02:31,040
And here's what I said.
I mean you're,

1465
01:02:31,050 --> 01:02:32,070
you're,
you're a gay guy.

1466
01:02:32,130 --> 01:02:32,963
I mean,
I would probably be worried if I start 

1467
01:02:34,531 --> 01:02:35,340
to see,
you know,

1468
01:02:35,340 --> 01:02:37,680
radical Islam start to take root in 
Europe.

1469
01:02:37,740 --> 01:02:38,970
Right?
You're a Christian.

1470
01:02:38,971 --> 01:02:40,110
I'd be worried too.
No,

1471
01:02:40,111 --> 01:02:41,760
I mean trust me,
I'm on that program.

1472
01:02:41,790 --> 01:02:44,100
Okay.
They want us both that and my friend.

1473
01:02:44,250 --> 01:02:44,970
Right.
I mean the,

1474
01:02:44,970 --> 01:02:45,803
and that's something I find to be 
horribly inconsistent with the left as 

1475
01:02:49,021 --> 01:02:49,854
they try to be the champions of all 
these minority groups and all these 

1476
01:02:52,290 --> 01:02:53,123
supposed to depress groups yet here they
are kind of joining forces with 

1477
01:02:55,921 --> 01:02:56,754
countries and movements and you know 
theocratic fascists in the Middle East 

1478
01:03:01,290 --> 01:03:04,230
that give homosexuals flying lessons on 
the top of buildings.

1479
01:03:05,140 --> 01:03:06,930
All right.
So then how do we,

1480
01:03:06,931 --> 01:03:07,764
I spent I think a good chunk,
especially the first year of this show 

1481
01:03:10,410 --> 01:03:11,243
trying to talk about radical Islam,
making a distinction between radical 

1482
01:03:14,671 --> 01:03:18,930
Islam and the nominal Muslim person who 
practices in faith privately.

1483
01:03:18,931 --> 01:03:21,420
However they do just like most sure 
people,

1484
01:03:21,510 --> 01:03:22,343
I try to separate Islam as a set of 
ideas worthy of criticism as 

1485
01:03:25,651 --> 01:03:29,970
Christianity is and you is and 
republicanism and all of that.

1486
01:03:29,971 --> 01:03:30,804
Okay.
Versus people versus criticizing people 

1487
01:03:32,761 --> 01:03:33,594
and treating people differently.
I think a lot of people in our space 

1488
01:03:36,211 --> 01:03:37,044
have tried to do that.
And you don't get a lot of credit for 

1489
01:03:38,431 --> 01:03:39,360
it,
but okay,

1490
01:03:39,361 --> 01:03:41,070
fine,
I don't need bonus credit.

1491
01:03:41,071 --> 01:03:45,840
But how,
how do we talk about radical Islam in an

1492
01:03:45,841 --> 01:03:46,890
honest way?
And I do.

1493
01:03:47,050 --> 01:03:49,080
There is a differentiation that needs to
be drawn,

1494
01:03:49,081 --> 01:03:49,914
but it also,
we also do need to talk about the 

1495
01:03:51,121 --> 01:03:54,420
broader implementation of an oven,
Islamic government and world view,

1496
01:03:54,780 --> 01:03:55,050
right?

1497
01:03:55,050 --> 01:04:00,050
So Islam as its core at its core has 
always been and will always be tied into

1498
01:04:00,230 --> 01:04:02,190
the state.
And as soon as they can demonstrate that

1499
01:04:02,191 --> 01:04:05,760
they can be a majority in a country and 
not be a theocratic government,

1500
01:04:05,880 --> 01:04:08,220
then I'll start to seed some territory 
against that.

1501
01:04:08,340 --> 01:04:09,750
So for example,
Saudi Arabia,

1502
01:04:10,020 --> 01:04:10,853
right?
So if you are a Christian in Saudi 

1503
01:04:11,940 --> 01:04:12,773
Arabia,
you lose your head.

1504
01:04:12,870 --> 01:04:14,910
If you're a Jew,
they'll find your family and kill all of

1505
01:04:14,911 --> 01:04:15,540
you.
That's,

1506
01:04:15,540 --> 01:04:17,670
there's something wrong about that,
right?

1507
01:04:17,671 --> 01:04:20,580
So I think we need to draw a great 
critique of that same in Iran,

1508
01:04:20,581 --> 01:04:22,990
which is Shia and Saudi.
Um,

1509
01:04:23,040 --> 01:04:25,800
which was Sunni.
And there's something really I think,

1510
01:04:26,190 --> 01:04:27,023
not correct about in modern society that
you have obviously a Muslim majority 

1511
01:04:30,901 --> 01:04:31,734
country and you know,
there is no Christians and no Jews and 

1512
01:04:33,991 --> 01:04:34,824
no churches and no synagogues.
There's something very intolerant about 

1513
01:04:36,781 --> 01:04:37,230
that.

1514
01:04:37,230 --> 01:04:39,900
However,
people that want to reform Islam,

1515
01:04:39,901 --> 01:04:41,490
I'm your biggest advocates,
right?

1516
01:04:41,790 --> 01:04:42,623
People that want to go through 
reformation of Islam and try to 

1517
01:04:45,811 --> 01:04:46,644
differentiate that no,
Islam does not have to be tied to the 

1518
01:04:49,141 --> 01:04:49,891
state.
And yes,

1519
01:04:49,891 --> 01:04:50,724
Islam can be tolerant of Christians and 
Jews and gays and the modern feminist 

1520
01:04:53,881 --> 01:04:56,420
movement and they should be allowed to 
vote and drive and you know,

1521
01:04:56,430 --> 01:04:59,550
be able to make decisions that they see 
fit and not have to wear a full his job.

1522
01:04:59,880 --> 01:05:04,880
I want those Muslims at succeed 
frightened that the more radical voices,

1523
01:05:05,311 --> 01:05:08,070
which are in the tens of millions,
if not hundreds of millions,

1524
01:05:08,340 --> 01:05:11,520
are actually getting more,
more of an audience.

1525
01:05:11,680 --> 01:05:13,200
They're there.
They're creating,

1526
01:05:13,230 --> 01:05:14,063
you know,
sectors of Europe that are quite 

1527
01:05:16,051 --> 01:05:16,884
troubling,
that are advocating for the advancement 

1528
01:05:19,421 --> 01:05:20,254
of these more dangerous ideologies that 
support honor killings and don't think 

1529
01:05:22,811 --> 01:05:23,644
women should have the right to drive or 
to vote or to be able to have 

1530
01:05:26,561 --> 01:05:28,720
representation,
any sort of form of government.

1531
01:05:28,990 --> 01:05:29,823
And so I think a broader critique of 
Islam needs to be put forth because 

1532
01:05:33,311 --> 01:05:36,040
they've been doing it against 
Christianity for the last 100 years.

1533
01:05:36,340 --> 01:05:37,173
I walk into a lecture hall and I hear 
about how incredibly intolerant 

1534
01:05:39,761 --> 01:05:43,000
Christians are and how they're terrible 
people find hard stop.

1535
01:05:43,120 --> 01:05:43,953
You go to the Vatican,
a woman is allowed to wear shorts and 

1536
01:05:45,940 --> 01:05:47,500
you know,
a cutoff tee shirt.

1537
01:05:47,770 --> 01:05:50,950
You go to Mecca and you're a Christian,
you get your head cut off.

1538
01:05:51,100 --> 01:05:52,360
I mean,
you literally can't go.

1539
01:05:52,390 --> 01:05:54,370
No,
you literally not allowed there.

1540
01:05:54,450 --> 01:05:55,600
They're literally not allowed.
So there,

1541
01:05:55,690 --> 01:05:56,523
there's,
there's a discussion that needs to 

1542
01:05:57,191 --> 01:05:59,680
happen where a broader reformation is 
necessary,

1543
01:05:59,980 --> 01:06:02,980
but the more radical voices of Islam are
actually succeeding.

1544
01:06:02,981 --> 01:06:05,290
Right now.
You look at the most viral,

1545
01:06:05,500 --> 01:06:07,480
um,
members of the youtube community and the

1546
01:06:07,510 --> 01:06:10,720
Sunni Saudi region,
but they're the ones that are advocating

1547
01:06:10,721 --> 01:06:12,940
for a holy war and the extermination of 
Christians.

1548
01:06:12,941 --> 01:06:14,440
They're the ones that are really taking 
root.

1549
01:06:14,800 --> 01:06:15,633
We have to support,
we have to reinforce and we have to 

1550
01:06:18,281 --> 01:06:22,630
really encourage the more ref,
the reformist Muslims to get a broader,

1551
01:06:22,820 --> 01:06:24,490
you know,
platform.

1552
01:06:24,491 --> 01:06:26,020
But I'm just not seeing it.
Yeah,

1553
01:06:26,021 --> 01:06:27,750
I mean I've tried to do the little bit 
of it.

1554
01:06:27,751 --> 01:06:28,870
You know,
you've done a great job,

1555
01:06:29,120 --> 01:06:31,250
some reformers and some ex Muslims and 
things like that,

1556
01:06:31,251 --> 01:06:32,084
but the problem is that they're 
constantly undercut by their own 

1557
01:06:34,820 --> 01:06:36,460
supposedly their own people.
Yeah.

1558
01:06:36,480 --> 01:06:38,810
I left every time is one of them talks 
about this.

1559
01:06:39,020 --> 01:06:42,090
They say you're a sellout or you are 
sure evil or you know,

1560
01:06:42,230 --> 01:06:42,850
whatever.
It

1561
01:06:42,850 --> 01:06:45,110
does beg the question like that,
that the,

1562
01:06:45,111 --> 01:06:49,150
the center of their faith is the most 
intolerant city in the world.

1563
01:06:49,540 --> 01:06:50,373
Like someone's got to take a broad stand
against that and maybe we'll see it in 

1564
01:06:52,841 --> 01:06:55,000
the next hundred years,
but how much had been some on,

1565
01:06:55,001 --> 01:06:55,834
you know,
the new crown prince of Saudi Arabia is 

1566
01:06:56,681 --> 01:06:58,330
trying to do some more,
you know,

1567
01:06:58,331 --> 01:06:59,164
modern changes.
But you're also seeing extraordinary 

1568
01:07:01,721 --> 01:07:04,300
radical voices in Saudi Arabia 
continually rise up.

1569
01:07:04,450 --> 01:07:06,340
You're seeing protests in a ran,
which is great,

1570
01:07:06,610 --> 01:07:07,443
but then you're seeing a lot of the 
western world not stand with these 

1571
01:07:08,951 --> 01:07:09,784
protests or see,
president trump has done a great job of 

1572
01:07:10,931 --> 01:07:12,730
it.
Obama who was totally silent.

1573
01:07:12,910 --> 01:07:14,860
So look,
Islam in general.

1574
01:07:15,070 --> 01:07:15,860
Um,
there's,

1575
01:07:15,860 --> 01:07:16,693
there's wonderful Muslim friends that I 
have and productive members of the 

1576
01:07:19,241 --> 01:07:20,074
American community that embrace this 
idea that you can hold your beliefs 

1577
01:07:22,840 --> 01:07:25,150
without having to have them push through
estate,

1578
01:07:25,300 --> 01:07:26,500
which is great.

1579
01:07:26,680 --> 01:07:28,990
But you're also seeing the exact 
opposite with the,

1580
01:07:29,000 --> 01:07:29,833
you know,
the Muslim Brotherhood taking further 

1581
01:07:30,671 --> 01:07:32,950
root in Egypt and in Turkey,
you're seeing,

1582
01:07:32,951 --> 01:07:33,784
you know,
Saudi Arabia want to continue its 

1583
01:07:34,631 --> 01:07:36,250
influence throughout the Arabian 
peninsula.

1584
01:07:36,580 --> 01:07:38,980
It's gonna be a conflict of ideas and 
it's the largest religion,

1585
01:07:38,981 --> 01:07:40,510
I believe in the world.
Correct me if I'm wrong.

1586
01:07:40,511 --> 01:07:41,344
1.2
billion people Christianity's right up 

1587
01:07:42,911 --> 01:07:43,744
against.
But I would argue that Islam has a lot 

1588
01:07:44,741 --> 01:07:46,810
more power in countries and Christianity
does.

1589
01:07:47,010 --> 01:07:47,843
It's a reformation that needs to happen.
So is the demographic time bomb and in 

1590
01:07:51,521 --> 01:07:53,110
Europe,
is it already too late?

1591
01:07:53,320 --> 01:07:55,060
It's troubling.
It's very troubling.

1592
01:07:55,061 --> 01:07:55,894
So as a byproduct of supporting social 
welfare programs and the sixties and 

1593
01:08:01,090 --> 01:08:03,580
seventies that deteriorated,
the influence of the Catholic Church and

1594
01:08:03,581 --> 01:08:07,030
in protestantism throughout Europe,
and really just kind of making people so

1595
01:08:07,031 --> 01:08:10,870
apathetic towards private philanthropy,
apathetic towards value creation,

1596
01:08:10,871 --> 01:08:11,704
entrepreneurship rates disappeared.
And you really created a lazy European 

1597
01:08:13,811 --> 01:08:14,290
society.

1598
01:08:14,290 --> 01:08:15,123
Hate to say it,
but they are not highly productive 

1599
01:08:16,431 --> 01:08:17,990
people.
They take the month of August off,

1600
01:08:18,200 --> 01:08:20,600
they have very little ambition.
They're okay being average.

1601
01:08:20,630 --> 01:08:22,010
That's not the society I want to live 
in.

1602
01:08:22,011 --> 01:08:24,770
America's always been aspirational.
We've been the most productive.

1603
01:08:24,771 --> 01:08:26,590
We've been the risk takers,
we've been the,

1604
01:08:26,750 --> 01:08:28,820
we've been the entrepreneurs.
So because of that,

1605
01:08:28,821 --> 01:08:29,654
they've laid themselves to be remarkably
vulnerable to a takeover culturally and 

1606
01:08:33,561 --> 01:08:35,780
demographically.
And you're starting to see that with the

1607
01:08:35,781 --> 01:08:36,614
millions of relocations from the Middle 
East of people that don't hold these 

1608
01:08:39,051 --> 01:08:39,884
views that the Europeans hold.
And honestly they come from a 

1609
01:08:41,841 --> 01:08:42,674
background,
whether it be Syria or Jordan or Yemen 

1610
01:08:44,571 --> 01:08:45,381
or Oman,
Yemen,

1611
01:08:45,381 --> 01:08:47,120
there's a huge humanitarian crisis 
happening.

1612
01:08:47,330 --> 01:08:50,450
They've known nothing but government 
being Islamic.

1613
01:08:50,810 --> 01:08:51,643
And so they inherently support that.
But if they want to go through a 

1614
01:08:54,151 --> 01:08:56,150
reformation and they can demonstrate,
they can do that.

1615
01:08:56,151 --> 01:08:56,740
Great.

1616
01:08:56,740 --> 01:08:57,290
I,
I'm,

1617
01:08:57,290 --> 01:08:58,123
I'm not seeing that though.
I'm seeing vast demographic clashes 

1618
01:09:01,040 --> 01:09:04,730
happening all throughout Europe.
There's also an interesting generational

1619
01:09:04,731 --> 01:09:06,740
piece to this,
which is that you find that a lot of the

1620
01:09:06,741 --> 01:09:09,980
older people that came from those 
countries,

1621
01:09:09,981 --> 01:09:11,600
you know,
30 years ago,

1622
01:09:11,750 --> 01:09:12,583
they actually are more westernized in 
their total drain are now they're sort 

1623
01:09:15,711 --> 01:09:16,544
of making up that there was something 
imaginarily great about Saddam that's 

1624
01:09:20,031 --> 01:09:21,650
correct.
Out where their parents and we need to,

1625
01:09:21,651 --> 01:09:22,484
we need to reform the,
you rebuild the califate and very 

1626
01:09:25,401 --> 01:09:26,510
dangerous.
Right.

1627
01:09:26,511 --> 01:09:27,344
And so you look at the reformation that 
Christianity right rightfully went 

1628
01:09:30,261 --> 01:09:34,430
through in the 1500 and 1,617
hundreds it's as soon as you embrace the

1629
01:09:34,431 --> 01:09:35,264
idea of personal freedom and individual 
liberty and you try to restrict the 

1630
01:09:38,211 --> 01:09:39,260
state.
So put your,

1631
01:09:39,261 --> 01:09:41,090
put yourself in the,
in the,

1632
01:09:41,180 --> 01:09:42,013
in the seat of the founding fathers.
They intentionally removed any sort of 

1633
01:09:46,191 --> 01:09:49,010
mention of Christian dumb in the 
constitution,

1634
01:09:49,011 --> 01:09:50,930
which ended up being the best thing for 
Christianity,

1635
01:09:51,050 --> 01:09:52,880
which created the most Christian nation 
in the world.

1636
01:09:52,880 --> 01:09:54,980
It does America think about how ironic 
that is,

1637
01:09:54,981 --> 01:09:57,080
right?
Whereas Europe didn't always do that.

1638
01:09:57,081 --> 01:10:00,920
They actually created these theocratic 
governments that led way to,

1639
01:10:00,940 --> 01:10:02,930
you know,
horrible conflict and you know,

1640
01:10:02,990 --> 01:10:06,560
ethno nationalism and eventually in the 
sixties and seventies like I mentioned,

1641
01:10:06,860 --> 01:10:09,200
the huge proliferation of the welfare 
state,

1642
01:10:09,201 --> 01:10:11,330
which was the worst decision Europe ever
made.

1643
01:10:11,540 --> 01:10:15,050
They turned a highly productive people 
into a mediocre,

1644
01:10:15,170 --> 01:10:19,580
Lazy Society that rejected all sorts of 
religion and any sort of,

1645
01:10:19,710 --> 01:10:20,543
you know,
connection to higher being and has now 

1646
01:10:22,401 --> 01:10:25,490
led themselves to a demographic takeover
that I think is the worst.

1647
01:10:25,491 --> 01:10:28,220
Some people think it's for the better.
I just don't see any evidence of that.

1648
01:10:28,670 --> 01:10:30,040
But again,
there's nothing,

1649
01:10:30,050 --> 01:10:30,600
there's,
I get,

1650
01:10:30,600 --> 01:10:31,433
I get,
I get criticized as being a racist and 

1651
01:10:32,751 --> 01:10:33,584
all this.
I'm not talking about a set of ideas 

1652
01:10:35,811 --> 01:10:39,890
that when implemented through the state 
have proven to be extremely dangerous to

1653
01:10:39,891 --> 01:10:40,724
human rights and economic productivity 
and private property rights and really 

1654
01:10:44,690 --> 01:10:45,441
cumin,
you know,

1655
01:10:45,441 --> 01:10:46,250
human dignity.

1656
01:10:46,250 --> 01:10:48,950
So when you've mentioned the phrase 
oppression Olympics a couple of times,

1657
01:10:48,951 --> 01:10:51,620
which obviously I totally buy in on,
which is from your video,

1658
01:10:51,621 --> 01:10:52,790
I stole it from you by the,
well,

1659
01:10:52,820 --> 01:10:53,653
I think I stole it from Faisal site on 
guitars and he probably stole it from 

1660
01:10:56,151 --> 01:10:57,800
somebody.
So that's how these ideas get around.

1661
01:10:58,040 --> 01:10:59,900
But um,
this idea of this,

1662
01:10:59,901 --> 01:11:02,210
this intersectional nonsense,
which is all nonsense,

1663
01:11:03,320 --> 01:11:04,153
how do you,
do you think that the average left 

1664
01:11:06,081 --> 01:11:09,300
person in America that says they're a 
feminist and therefore,

1665
01:11:09,301 --> 01:11:10,134
what do you think that they don't 
recognize any of the stuff that just 

1666
01:11:13,261 --> 01:11:14,094
said about that?
Obviously don't talk about it or they 

1667
01:11:15,761 --> 01:11:16,470
might,
they might,

1668
01:11:16,470 --> 01:11:18,660
they might recognize it.
They might know about it.

1669
01:11:18,661 --> 01:11:20,760
They might be able to answer it in a 
trivial pursuit game.

1670
01:11:21,030 --> 01:11:23,370
But the question is here.
So your,

1671
01:11:23,490 --> 01:11:25,350
there's the international feminist 
society,

1672
01:11:25,351 --> 01:11:27,630
which is growing huge on campus and I 
always challenge them.

1673
01:11:28,050 --> 01:11:28,883
They advocate for women's rights across 
the world and then they're like right 

1674
01:11:30,721 --> 01:11:33,780
next to like the Muslim student 
association,

1675
01:11:33,781 --> 01:11:35,130
which is fine.
They should be friends.

1676
01:11:35,131 --> 01:11:35,964
That's okay.
Like,

1677
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:36,833
but why are they not demonstrating wide 
said pr widespread protests against how 

1678
01:11:39,361 --> 01:11:40,194
women are treated in Saudi Arabia,
but the international feminist society 

1679
01:11:43,151 --> 01:11:46,290
is protesting for against Israel.
It's weird,

1680
01:11:46,350 --> 01:11:48,090
right?
It's like because intersectionality,

1681
01:11:48,091 --> 01:11:48,924
it's like they have this weird construct
that we must advocate against Israel 

1682
01:11:52,321 --> 01:11:54,480
because Israel is a friend of America 
and America hates women.

1683
01:11:54,481 --> 01:11:57,550
It's like this weird,
like I,

1684
01:11:58,020 --> 01:12:00,840
I need like this big map.
Like where they kind of try,

1685
01:12:00,841 --> 01:12:03,890
it doesn't make any sense,
but where is the outrage?

1686
01:12:03,910 --> 01:12:05,370
They say there's outrage when I 
challenged them.

1687
01:12:05,371 --> 01:12:06,570
Oh yeah.
We're really outraged about it.

1688
01:12:06,571 --> 01:12:07,051
Yeah.
Okay,

1689
01:12:07,051 --> 01:12:07,970
sure.
But no,

1690
01:12:07,980 --> 01:12:08,491
we're,
we're,

1691
01:12:08,491 --> 01:12:09,480
where's the,
where's the,

1692
01:12:09,540 --> 01:12:11,310
where's the Oprah Winfrey's,
right?

1693
01:12:11,430 --> 01:12:14,400
Where's the Hillary Clinton's who spoke 
multiple times and Saudi Arabia and took

1694
01:12:14,970 --> 01:12:16,200
millions of dollars from them.

1695
01:12:16,440 --> 01:12:18,660
Right?
We're women can't drive where women can,

1696
01:12:18,661 --> 01:12:21,090
we now that can drive and that's going 
to be a real disaster,

1697
01:12:21,260 --> 01:12:21,870
you know?
No,

1698
01:12:21,870 --> 01:12:25,770
it is because all of a sudden they're 
just wait for the moms to get your hands

1699
01:12:25,771 --> 01:12:26,460
up.
Hands up there.

1700
01:12:26,460 --> 01:12:27,540
The women are,
what do you mean?

1701
01:12:27,860 --> 01:12:28,693
Oh,
because they're going to have a total 

1702
01:12:29,101 --> 01:12:29,934
religious clash about this because Hamad
had been some say it's said by decree 

1703
01:12:33,450 --> 01:12:34,283
that women can drive and there's going 
to be all these religious 

1704
01:12:35,671 --> 01:12:36,504
fundamentalists that are not gonna allow
it to happen and it's going to be a 

1705
01:12:38,790 --> 01:12:39,623
total conflict.
They were bragging that women are 

1706
01:12:40,471 --> 01:12:44,250
allowed to go to movies now like that to
show you how medieval Saudi Arabia's,

1707
01:12:44,280 --> 01:12:44,971
right.
But anyway,

1708
01:12:44,971 --> 01:12:46,860
Hillary Clinton made this like her 
pinnacle,

1709
01:12:47,100 --> 01:12:48,870
you know,
point of her campaign is like,

1710
01:12:48,871 --> 01:12:50,970
I'm going to really have good relations 
with Saudi Arabia.

1711
01:12:50,971 --> 01:12:52,710
Her Foundation took tens of millions of 
dollars.

1712
01:12:52,820 --> 01:12:57,480
Here was a woman that ran on the idea of
like feminist representation.

1713
01:12:58,110 --> 01:12:58,943
Right?
And she can't critique Saudi Arabia 

1714
01:13:00,901 --> 01:13:01,950
once.
Right.

1715
01:13:01,951 --> 01:13:04,260
But she critiques Israel for the 
settlements.

1716
01:13:04,350 --> 01:13:05,183
Right.
So I think there's unbelievable 

1717
01:13:05,971 --> 01:13:08,040
hypocrisy there,
but it's not just Saudi Arabia,

1718
01:13:08,041 --> 01:13:09,780
which I'm focusing on.
It's Egypt.

1719
01:13:09,900 --> 01:13:11,490
It's a rant.
It's Iraq,

1720
01:13:11,491 --> 01:13:12,780
which is changing.
It's Syria,

1721
01:13:12,900 --> 01:13:14,310
it's Jordan,
it's on mine.

1722
01:13:14,340 --> 01:13:15,930
It's Yemen.
The only countries that get it.

1723
01:13:15,931 --> 01:13:16,764
Right.
Or Katar.

1724
01:13:16,980 --> 01:13:18,630
Right.
And maybe the UAE.

1725
01:13:18,720 --> 01:13:20,950
But you have,
you have a geographic dis,

1726
01:13:20,980 --> 01:13:21,813
you know,
disposition of hundreds of millions of 

1727
01:13:24,001 --> 01:13:27,990
square miles where women cannot vote.
Women cannot own property.

1728
01:13:28,020 --> 01:13:31,170
Women cannot start businesses.
Women cannot serve in government.

1729
01:13:31,350 --> 01:13:33,780
Men have total and absolute control over
society.

1730
01:13:33,781 --> 01:13:35,250
Gays.
They asked [inaudible] shot.

1731
01:13:35,251 --> 01:13:36,084
They said,
how do you,

1732
01:13:36,340 --> 01:13:37,500
how do you treat?
Don't have it.

1733
01:13:37,610 --> 01:13:38,070
No.
Yeah.

1734
01:13:38,070 --> 01:13:38,903
How do you treat gays and your society?
We do not have homosexuals in our 

1735
01:13:40,831 --> 01:13:41,330
country.

1736
01:13:41,330 --> 01:13:42,840
That's great.
Where's the,

1737
01:13:42,870 --> 01:13:46,350
where's the LGBT international society 
protesting against that,

1738
01:13:46,351 --> 01:13:46,920
right?
Yeah.

1739
01:13:46,920 --> 01:13:48,930
It's like they have this kind of like 
handshake,

1740
01:13:48,931 --> 01:13:49,764
like we're not going to mention this.
It's all good that I can't stand 

1741
01:13:51,571 --> 01:13:52,890
anymore.
And then what?

1742
01:13:52,891 --> 01:13:53,724
What country did they hate the most?
Of course it's Israel where they were 

1743
01:13:56,010 --> 01:13:59,280
days are open or openly productive 
members of society.

1744
01:13:59,281 --> 01:14:00,780
I think they can marry in Israel.
I'm not sure,

1745
01:14:01,050 --> 01:14:01,883
but I,
the West has been the best to women and 

1746
01:14:05,401 --> 01:14:09,330
to gays and yet they want to destroy the
last,

1747
01:14:09,990 --> 01:14:12,040
which doesn't make any sense to me.
By the way,

1748
01:14:12,041 --> 01:14:12,874
you mentioned settlements a minute ago.
I think that Jesus guy you referenced 

1749
01:14:14,711 --> 01:14:15,544
before,
I lived in a town called Bethlehem and 

1750
01:14:16,631 --> 01:14:19,380
where he was born in that lands in the 
West Bank.

1751
01:14:19,381 --> 01:14:20,081
Yeah,
exactly.

1752
01:14:20,081 --> 01:14:22,480
Jesus of Nazareth.
Minor details here,

1753
01:14:22,510 --> 01:14:23,343
right?
Yeah.

1754
01:14:23,700 --> 01:14:25,420
History though.
He's just lost on people,

1755
01:14:25,421 --> 01:14:25,660
right?

1756
01:14:25,660 --> 01:14:26,493
Is that like,
to me that's one of the most horrible 

1757
01:14:27,770 --> 01:14:28,603
things like that.
People don't know basics about history 

1758
01:14:31,140 --> 01:14:33,100
and even it's,
it's the basics,

1759
01:14:33,101 --> 01:14:36,140
but it's just like the ignorance of 
understanding the,

1760
01:14:36,210 --> 01:14:39,820
the blessings we have,
the live in western civilization and how

1761
01:14:39,821 --> 01:14:40,654
unique what we really have here as a 
country and it's being taught in our 

1762
01:14:43,551 --> 01:14:46,040
universities how America is a racist,
xenophobic,

1763
01:14:46,090 --> 01:14:47,500
imperialist,
horrible country,

1764
01:14:47,860 --> 01:14:48,693
and you really have to try.
It takes effort to try to make that 

1765
01:14:50,891 --> 01:14:54,970
argument because America has been one of
the greatest,

1766
01:14:54,971 --> 01:14:55,804
if not one of the greatest ideas ever 
implemented in human history and civil 

1767
01:14:58,871 --> 01:15:01,270
society.
It's had more respect for human rights.

1768
01:15:01,450 --> 01:15:02,283
Instead more economic productivity.
We have freed more people from serfdom 

1769
01:15:05,770 --> 01:15:09,850
and from bondage in any other country.
We voluntarily sent our citizens and our

1770
01:15:09,851 --> 01:15:10,684
civilians and our soldiers to die for 
the freedoms of others not asking for 

1771
01:15:13,631 --> 01:15:14,620
anything in return.

1772
01:15:14,710 --> 01:15:16,240
You look at the Korean War,
we send,

1773
01:15:16,440 --> 01:15:17,830
you know,
our boys from Iowa,

1774
01:15:17,831 --> 01:15:18,664
Kansas,
South Carolina and Florida to go die in 

1775
01:15:19,871 --> 01:15:21,310
the Korean Peninsula,
50,000

1776
01:15:21,311 --> 01:15:22,144
of them so that South Korea can exist.
We asked for nothing in return if we 

1777
01:15:24,761 --> 01:15:27,280
were in pure lists where the worst 
imperialist ever.

1778
01:15:27,340 --> 01:15:30,550
Right?
And so yet it takes the effort to really

1779
01:15:30,551 --> 01:15:31,384
look at,
look at history and say that we're a 

1780
01:15:32,381 --> 01:15:33,214
horrible place.
And this is what the modern American 

1781
01:15:35,291 --> 01:15:36,124
left is trying to do is like,
remember when I send the beginning of 

1782
01:15:37,991 --> 01:15:39,100
the video,
we have a choice.

1783
01:15:39,430 --> 01:15:40,263
We can either go the way of Europe and 
totally fundamentally transform this 

1784
01:15:43,241 --> 01:15:45,280
country and embrace a set of ideas we've
never had.

1785
01:15:45,490 --> 01:15:46,323
Or we can defend respect and advanced 
American ideas here and really try to 

1786
01:15:49,541 --> 01:15:51,610
make the 21st century the greatest 
who've ever had.

1787
01:15:52,120 --> 01:15:55,030
Is there an inherent risk in some of 
that though that yes,

1788
01:15:55,031 --> 01:15:57,060
there are things like South Korea,
that workout.

1789
01:15:57,320 --> 01:15:59,290
There's also,
it's on foreign policy.

1790
01:15:59,510 --> 01:16:01,390
I mean there's a lot of instances we've 
had,

1791
01:16:01,420 --> 01:16:03,030
we tried the kinds of blunders,
I mean I'll,

1792
01:16:03,031 --> 01:16:05,680
rack war was a total mistake.
It was a disaster.

1793
01:16:06,010 --> 01:16:08,830
So they,
so that's just the inherent risk in this

1794
01:16:08,831 --> 01:16:09,880
space.
I don't know.

1795
01:16:09,881 --> 01:16:10,714
That was sanctioned by the way,
by Congress and the Senate and sure the 

1796
01:16:12,701 --> 01:16:13,600
united,
it wasn't,

1797
01:16:13,601 --> 01:16:16,300
it wasn't actually an effect of war of 
authorization.

1798
01:16:16,301 --> 01:16:17,134
It was a conflict.
But so what I meant there is a broader 

1799
01:16:18,791 --> 01:16:19,624
point that throughout the 20th century 
America has stepped up and fought for 

1800
01:16:22,481 --> 01:16:24,880
the freedom and liberty of others I'd 
ever asking for something in return.

1801
01:16:25,060 --> 01:16:29,320
I would argue that Iraq was a,
was a horrible response to nine 11.

1802
01:16:29,321 --> 01:16:30,154
It had nothing to do with the actual 
existential threats against the 

1803
01:16:32,261 --> 01:16:34,360
homeland.
That was George W.

1804
01:16:34,360 --> 01:16:36,970
Bush trying to rectify a mistake that 
his father didn't actually make,

1805
01:16:37,120 --> 01:16:38,170
which was takeover,
you know,

1806
01:16:38,230 --> 01:16:39,430
Saddam Hussein's empire.

1807
01:16:39,640 --> 01:16:41,890
We got next to nothing.
We lost 30,000

1808
01:16:41,891 --> 01:16:44,890
American troops.
We spent $2 trillion we didn't have,

1809
01:16:44,980 --> 01:16:47,160
and we helped create isis to boot.
Um,

1810
01:16:47,380 --> 01:16:48,213
so imposing American ideas worldwide is 
not something that I would have ever 

1811
01:16:51,881 --> 01:16:53,560
advocated for,
but argue what,

1812
01:16:53,561 --> 01:16:55,000
when,
when the chips are down.

1813
01:16:55,001 --> 01:16:56,140
For example,
you know,

1814
01:16:56,141 --> 01:16:56,974
in World War II and you know,
the Nazi empire is on the March and 

1815
01:17:00,040 --> 01:17:02,920
they're 16 miles away from Moscow and 
you know,

1816
01:17:03,040 --> 01:17:07,210
Winston Churchill is on his hands and 
knees begging FDR to send troops.

1817
01:17:07,540 --> 01:17:08,560
Then we send,
you know,

1818
01:17:08,680 --> 01:17:10,880
half million ground troops to go through
Normandy.

1819
01:17:10,910 --> 01:17:11,990
We stepped up,
right?

1820
01:17:12,170 --> 01:17:15,320
And we help push back European fascism.
So look,

1821
01:17:15,321 --> 01:17:16,154
there's been a lot of mistakes.
Some of our incursions in Central 

1822
01:17:17,541 --> 01:17:21,290
America were total disasters,
but net positive America's,

1823
01:17:21,530 --> 01:17:22,550
you know,
um,

1824
01:17:22,580 --> 01:17:24,470
decisions throughout the 20th century 
have helped,

1825
01:17:24,800 --> 01:17:26,120
you know,
advanced human freedom and,

1826
01:17:26,600 --> 01:17:27,860
and release people from bondage.

1827
01:17:27,920 --> 01:17:28,753
So to that end,
you must love what trump's dealing with 

1828
01:17:30,381 --> 01:17:31,100
the UN,
right?

1829
01:17:31,100 --> 01:17:31,881
Oh,
it's fantastic.

1830
01:17:31,881 --> 01:17:33,440
Are you kidding?
Really is a freaking all stars.

1831
01:17:33,800 --> 01:17:36,890
Here's what I love about Nikki Haley to 
my left is people watching this.

1832
01:17:37,310 --> 01:17:40,940
How can you not recognize she was 
everything you pretend to advocate for?

1833
01:17:41,120 --> 01:17:41,380
No,
no,

1834
01:17:41,380 --> 01:17:42,350
seriously,
because she's,

1835
01:17:42,351 --> 01:17:44,000
she's a son,
daughter of an immigrant.

1836
01:17:44,480 --> 01:17:47,990
She's a minority and she's Indian like 
from actual India.

1837
01:17:48,040 --> 01:17:49,100
Right.
Which is one of their,

1838
01:17:49,101 --> 01:17:50,810
I think oppression Olympics groups.
Right.

1839
01:17:50,890 --> 01:17:51,723
Well,
you saw this thing like a couple of 

1840
01:17:51,951 --> 01:17:54,370
weeks ago where they were trying to mock
her for using the name Nikki,

1841
01:17:54,670 --> 01:17:56,610
and it's like,
that's what her parents call.

1842
01:17:56,650 --> 01:17:57,483
I know me.
Imagine if a Republican said that 

1843
01:17:59,111 --> 01:18:01,840
there'd be March.
She's totally self made.

1844
01:18:02,020 --> 01:18:04,600
Her father literally owned convenience 
stores,

1845
01:18:04,690 --> 01:18:08,800
started at as state senator ran as an 
insurgent for governor twice elected,

1846
01:18:08,830 --> 01:18:11,860
eradicated the confederate flag from her
State Capitol,

1847
01:18:12,100 --> 01:18:12,933
balanced the budget,
created South Carolina into this 

1848
01:18:14,260 --> 01:18:17,770
unbelievably prosperous state in a very 
complicated political state.

1849
01:18:17,771 --> 01:18:18,490
By the way,
by the way,

1850
01:18:18,490 --> 01:18:19,151
they always said,
you know,

1851
01:18:19,151 --> 01:18:20,230
the south is so racist.
Well,

1852
01:18:20,231 --> 01:18:22,170
they help twice elected,
you know,

1853
01:18:22,270 --> 01:18:23,103
a woman,
minority governor of a state that you 

1854
01:18:25,241 --> 01:18:26,110
call,
you know,

1855
01:18:26,111 --> 01:18:27,100
the new,
you know,

1856
01:18:27,130 --> 01:18:28,120
confederacy.
Anyway,

1857
01:18:28,640 --> 01:18:30,100
Tim Scott Guy.
Exactly.

1858
01:18:30,101 --> 01:18:31,270
Yeah.
One of the only,

1859
01:18:31,490 --> 01:18:32,323
there's only two African American 
senators and one of them's from what 

1860
01:18:33,791 --> 01:18:35,380
they call one of the most racist states 
in the country.

1861
01:18:35,381 --> 01:18:36,214
That's beside the point.
Yeah.

1862
01:18:36,370 --> 01:18:39,070
Then she gets selected by president 
trump who supposedly hates women,

1863
01:18:39,071 --> 01:18:39,904
but he has a represent us in the UN to 
go fiercely fight against all these 

1864
01:18:42,941 --> 01:18:46,330
globalists forces at the UN cuts aid to 
the Pakistan.

1865
01:18:46,480 --> 01:18:48,790
She is what the left is supposed to 
love.

1866
01:18:48,791 --> 01:18:50,170
Right.
She is the,

1867
01:18:50,230 --> 01:18:53,920
she is this absolute bodymind of modern 
day feminism.

1868
01:18:54,270 --> 01:18:55,103
Yet they hate her.

1869
01:18:55,120 --> 01:18:57,970
Did you see this tweet the other day by 
the at Democrats?

1870
01:18:57,971 --> 01:18:58,920
You know the official,
Oh yeah,

1871
01:18:58,921 --> 01:19:01,870
well all the check marks women have a 
qualified woman.

1872
01:19:01,900 --> 01:19:03,850
But the bet,
well that of course that's the,

1873
01:19:03,880 --> 01:19:07,720
that's like the blanket response but the
best was so it was like,

1874
01:19:07,721 --> 01:19:09,820
you know,
do minority women and Brown women,

1875
01:19:09,821 --> 01:19:12,880
but the amount of people who just wrote 
it all right,

1876
01:19:12,881 --> 01:19:14,860
you're endorsing Nikki Haley and it's 
like,

1877
01:19:14,861 --> 01:19:15,880
man,
you guys,

1878
01:19:16,090 --> 01:19:17,960
this is what you idiots have created.
Yep.

1879
01:19:18,260 --> 01:19:19,021
It's right there.
They are.

1880
01:19:19,021 --> 01:19:19,854
And I can't tell you,
it's really interesting because so many 

1881
01:19:21,681 --> 01:19:23,960
of our turning point members and our 
turning points students,

1882
01:19:24,080 --> 01:19:25,160
I say,
why are you conservative?

1883
01:19:25,161 --> 01:19:26,780
I'm a student.
I'm not concerned because of the left.

1884
01:19:27,560 --> 01:19:28,393
I left the left because the left,
because they have lost their freaking 

1885
01:19:31,581 --> 01:19:32,414
mind.
Like if they were just like normal 

1886
01:19:33,951 --> 01:19:34,784
democrats and didn't say the stupid 
stuff and an intersectionality politics 

1887
01:19:38,451 --> 01:19:40,880
and like they argued like,
well we can run govern better,

1888
01:19:40,881 --> 01:19:43,010
but free enterprise is a good thing but 
flawed and we need pr.

1889
01:19:43,280 --> 01:19:45,290
We need to perfect it.
And you know,

1890
01:19:45,291 --> 01:19:46,124
if they actually had some humility for 
it instead of just like embracing 

1891
01:19:48,411 --> 01:19:50,960
cultural Marxism and doing the 
oppression Olympics,

1892
01:19:51,350 --> 01:19:55,640
I think you might still be on the left 
instead they created the greatest gift.

1893
01:19:55,641 --> 01:19:57,410
Thank you liberals for doing this 
leftist.

1894
01:19:57,580 --> 01:19:58,413
Cause now we have like former Bernie 
Sanders supporters running our chapters 

1895
01:20:01,190 --> 01:20:02,023
because they are now cultural marxists 
that look at people at the color of 

1896
01:20:04,341 --> 01:20:07,650
their skin by how much value they have 
in the world or how great can understand

1897
01:20:07,651 --> 01:20:08,550
someone's,
you know,

1898
01:20:08,630 --> 01:20:09,420
v,
you know,

1899
01:20:09,420 --> 01:20:10,253
degree of suffering,
which is everything that Martin Luther 

1900
01:20:12,810 --> 01:20:13,643
King argued against,
which is everything that is 

1901
01:20:14,821 --> 01:20:16,620
fundamentally created this country.

1902
01:20:16,620 --> 01:20:19,350
And so thank you.
Left us for helping create this movement

1903
01:20:19,351 --> 01:20:21,540
for us.
Are there any good Democrats left?

1904
01:20:21,570 --> 01:20:22,290
Oh sure.
They're like,

1905
01:20:22,290 --> 01:20:23,123
I have my issues with plenty of 
Republicans and I'd be more should of a 

1906
01:20:25,141 --> 01:20:28,930
rand Paul Republican and a libertarian 
on board join the,

1907
01:20:28,980 --> 01:20:29,370
the,
you know,

1908
01:20:29,370 --> 01:20:30,203
I call it on the sif evil empire.
You could join the resist the real 

1909
01:20:32,431 --> 01:20:33,630
results,
the real resistance.

1910
01:20:33,690 --> 01:20:34,523
I mean,
look for the stuff that I like about 

1911
01:20:36,140 --> 01:20:38,700
Rand Abi at Rand Paul obviously has all 
the Libertarians of course,

1912
01:20:38,730 --> 01:20:41,610
sadly in that collection of 18 people 
that were running against trump,

1913
01:20:41,730 --> 01:20:42,563
he was seemingly on the wrong stage.
It's just the party had nothing to do 

1914
01:20:45,331 --> 01:20:46,920
with that time,
what he wanted.

1915
01:20:47,040 --> 01:20:48,390
Even if,
as you've said before,

1916
01:20:48,400 --> 01:20:49,233
trump may be doing a lot of those,
those things right now we show you how 

1917
01:20:51,741 --> 01:20:54,140
complex this whole very convenient.
But um,

1918
01:20:54,310 --> 01:20:56,340
the question I think you had was,
um,

1919
01:20:56,370 --> 01:20:57,780
but the new generation,
like who do I need?

1920
01:20:57,780 --> 01:20:59,970
Good Democrats.
Is there anyone now that you can,

1921
01:20:59,971 --> 01:21:00,860
sure.
I,

1922
01:21:00,870 --> 01:21:01,703
I'm still looking for that kind of like 
blue dog Democrat to rise up and be 

1923
01:21:04,501 --> 01:21:05,910
like,
you know,

1924
01:21:05,970 --> 01:21:08,400
I'm a democrat.
That is pro choice,

1925
01:21:08,401 --> 01:21:10,770
which I disagree with whatever that is.
You know,

1926
01:21:10,771 --> 01:21:11,604
all these things.
But I still think America's a great 

1927
01:21:13,261 --> 01:21:17,190
country and we need to like rid our con,
our country of Antifa.

1928
01:21:17,340 --> 01:21:19,500
Alan Dershowitz is probably the only one
I could think of right now.

1929
01:21:19,560 --> 01:21:20,393
Who was built the way he's getting 
kicked out of the Democrat party buddy 

1930
01:21:22,310 --> 01:21:23,143
abuse.
He's taking them saying this every week 

1931
01:21:24,930 --> 01:21:26,940
since when has it been a bad thing to be
Alan Dershowitz?

1932
01:21:26,941 --> 01:21:28,650
I mean,
the guy is freaking brilliant.

1933
01:21:28,830 --> 01:21:29,663
You might disagree with him,
but he's like the smartest lawyer and 

1934
01:21:32,911 --> 01:21:34,740
human rights attorney that you could 
possibly find.

1935
01:21:34,741 --> 01:21:35,574
And now the Democrats have been like,
he's our cues being paid by the trump 

1936
01:21:37,951 --> 01:21:38,560
camp parenting.

1937
01:21:38,560 --> 01:21:39,630
Like,
are you kidding me?

1938
01:21:40,230 --> 01:21:41,063
I mean,
he's brilliant and they're kicking them 

1939
01:21:41,920 --> 01:21:43,830
out.
I love that man.

1940
01:21:43,890 --> 01:21:45,390
So yeah,
there are some good Democrats out there,

1941
01:21:45,450 --> 01:21:46,283
Charlie.
I suspect we could do this for a couple 

1942
01:21:47,850 --> 01:21:49,830
of more hours,
but I'm only going to ask you one.

1943
01:21:49,860 --> 01:21:51,510
Okay.
Because I want this on the record,

1944
01:21:51,511 --> 01:21:53,070
on this show,
because when it happens,

1945
01:21:53,320 --> 01:21:55,350
uh,
it should be that I asked at first,

1946
01:21:56,220 --> 01:21:58,100
you're going to run for Senate.
No,

1947
01:21:59,970 --> 01:22:01,440
not for political office.
I want to,

1948
01:22:01,441 --> 01:22:06,441
I want to be a commentator and a 
movement driver.

1949
01:22:07,350 --> 01:22:10,410
Does that have anything to do with the 
clown show that that running?

1950
01:22:10,411 --> 01:22:11,244
Is that a guy like you who you obviously
have a great understanding of the 

1951
01:22:13,681 --> 01:22:14,514
issues.
You have a consistent line of thought 

1952
01:22:16,051 --> 01:22:17,880
whether I agree with you on every far 
too principled.

1953
01:22:18,990 --> 01:22:19,823
No,
but there's something to be said for 

1954
01:22:20,521 --> 01:22:20,931
that.
Right?

1955
01:22:20,931 --> 01:22:24,220
So I mean that goes to what coworker 
said about he's the broker,

1956
01:22:24,240 --> 01:22:24,840
right?

1957
01:22:24,840 --> 01:22:27,750
But in all reality,
I love what I got to do.

1958
01:22:27,870 --> 01:22:28,703
Seriously.
Like every day I get to create a 

1959
01:22:30,271 --> 01:22:31,890
movement and helps facilitate a moving 
out,

1960
01:22:31,891 --> 01:22:32,724
create and say what I want to say and be
able to have conversations with you on 

1961
01:22:36,901 --> 01:22:37,734
all this stuff.
I've met very few Congress people or 

1962
01:22:40,321 --> 01:22:43,260
senators or governors that actually 
enjoy what they do seriously.

1963
01:22:43,650 --> 01:22:44,483
And it's always about meeting with 
lobbyists or cow towing to leadership 

1964
01:22:46,741 --> 01:22:47,574
and fundraising.
It just makes me sick to my stomach 

1965
01:22:48,781 --> 01:22:51,510
thinking about that.
But let's pretend it was a great gig,

1966
01:22:51,511 --> 01:22:52,344
which some of them seem to like it.
I don't know why they liked the 

1967
01:22:54,961 --> 01:22:55,794
corruption or something I like.
Is that really a place where I can do 

1968
01:22:58,171 --> 01:23:00,080
the most amount of good for my 
worldview?

1969
01:23:00,090 --> 01:23:01,470
And I would say probably not.
No.

1970
01:23:01,471 --> 01:23:03,060
I'd say look,
turning points,

1971
01:23:03,061 --> 01:23:05,070
doing a great service for the country.

1972
01:23:05,080 --> 01:23:07,330
I think right now I love what I get to 
do.

1973
01:23:07,360 --> 01:23:08,290
I have,
you know,

1974
01:23:08,320 --> 01:23:11,290
have some influence in helping shape 
this policy in this agenda.

1975
01:23:11,680 --> 01:23:14,080
And that doesn't seem like fun to me.
I do.

1976
01:23:14,090 --> 01:23:16,840
It doesn't seem like that would maximize
my amount of happiness.

1977
01:23:16,990 --> 01:23:17,823
Yeah.
All right,

1978
01:23:17,830 --> 01:23:19,870
well it's on the record now.
It's on the record.

1979
01:23:19,871 --> 01:23:20,704
I still,
I hope I don't talk like a politician 

1980
01:23:24,310 --> 01:23:25,580
to,
uh,

1981
01:23:25,840 --> 01:23:27,700
I think we're doing a gig together in 
New Hampshire.

1982
01:23:27,730 --> 01:23:28,390
Yeah,
that'd be fine.

1983
01:23:28,390 --> 01:23:29,750
Not too long from now.
So we'll,

1984
01:23:29,751 --> 01:23:31,820
when we get in canvas will be there too.
And Canada's Owens.

1985
01:23:31,950 --> 01:23:33,100
Oh,
real quick.

1986
01:23:33,101 --> 01:23:33,460
Yeah,
sure.

1987
01:23:33,460 --> 01:23:35,650
Let's just finish talking to the 
candidate I backhand is for a moment.

1988
01:23:35,651 --> 01:23:37,810
So when I,
when I met you that day,

1989
01:23:37,811 --> 01:23:39,910
I referenced that and literally a minute
before you had,

1990
01:23:39,911 --> 01:23:42,760
I saw it from a distance you,
we can just talk for about two minutes.

1991
01:23:42,910 --> 01:23:44,410
And then she walked over to me and she's
like,

1992
01:23:44,440 --> 01:23:47,350
I just got a job with turning point.
Charlie wants me to,

1993
01:23:47,351 --> 01:23:48,184
you know,
help talk to the black community and 

1994
01:23:49,151 --> 01:23:49,361
Blah,
blah,

1995
01:23:49,361 --> 01:23:50,194
blah.
She's quickly becoming an all star in 

1996
01:23:52,151 --> 01:23:52,984
this space.
I think she escaped some of the Youtube 

1997
01:23:54,820 --> 01:23:55,653
Madness,
which I'm somewhat aware of and you may 

1998
01:23:57,341 --> 01:23:59,860
have seen my insane debate with her and 
Blair white and blah,

1999
01:23:59,861 --> 01:24:00,694
blah blah,
but she's quickly becoming a real 

2000
01:24:02,531 --> 01:24:07,531
powerhouse hodel voice because the black
community has needed more p,

2001
01:24:07,700 --> 01:24:08,533
you know the Thomas Souls that Larry 
Elders and David Webb's and who have 

2002
01:24:12,551 --> 01:24:13,720
Allen West,
whoever else there,

2003
01:24:13,810 --> 01:24:14,643
it's a different generation.
She's coming at it from the firm at 

2004
01:24:16,570 --> 01:24:18,250
young place.
It's kind of beautiful.

2005
01:24:18,410 --> 01:24:19,243
She's unbelievably talented.
I'm spent a considerable amount of time 

2006
01:24:21,941 --> 01:24:24,310
with her now minus the five minutes I 
hired her,

2007
01:24:24,640 --> 01:24:27,670
but she's a passionate driven person.
Look broader than that.

2008
01:24:27,850 --> 01:24:28,683
She like,
like all of us on our team believe and 

2009
01:24:31,511 --> 01:24:32,344
understand there is a movement happening
in this country and it's something the 

2010
01:24:35,571 --> 01:24:36,404
media will not report.
It's something palpable when you 

2011
01:24:37,961 --> 01:24:39,370
experience it,
you saw it in Florida.

2012
01:24:39,371 --> 01:24:40,720
There's something happening in the 
story.

2013
01:24:40,721 --> 01:24:41,680
Something crazy.
Yeah,

2014
01:24:41,840 --> 01:24:42,673
it's,
it's almost squaws I spiritual 

2015
01:24:45,011 --> 01:24:45,640
political.
It's,

2016
01:24:45,640 --> 01:24:46,473
there's something happening because the 
left has tried for far too long to 

2017
01:24:49,810 --> 01:24:53,440
suppress the movement of ideas and it's 
free speech and dialog and discussion.

2018
01:24:53,650 --> 01:24:56,110
But what candace believes,
which I'm in full support of,

2019
01:24:56,111 --> 01:24:57,730
and I want to help her in every way 
possible,

2020
01:24:58,000 --> 01:25:01,000
is that the African American community 
has been totally,

2021
01:25:01,130 --> 01:25:02,260
um,
dis served,

2022
01:25:02,410 --> 01:25:03,243
for lack of a better term by the modern 
Democratic Party and that they are 

2023
01:25:06,071 --> 01:25:06,904
disproportionately more poor.
They're disproportionally in worse 

2024
01:25:08,951 --> 01:25:12,070
circumstances than people of every other
ethnic or racial group.

2025
01:25:12,100 --> 01:25:12,933
But why is that?
It's not because Americans are more 

2026
01:25:14,471 --> 01:25:16,840
racist country then we were in the 1960s
in fact,

2027
01:25:16,841 --> 01:25:17,674
no one with a straight face could 
possibly say that yet African Americans 

2028
01:25:19,751 --> 01:25:21,640
are poor today than they were in the 
1960s.

2029
01:25:21,820 --> 01:25:24,580
So what happened to use a Hillary 
Clinton term?

2030
01:25:24,880 --> 01:25:28,570
America did not get more racist.
America got significantly less racist.

2031
01:25:28,571 --> 01:25:29,404
There's still racism in this country,
but a lot of it has been eradicated if 

2032
01:25:31,721 --> 01:25:32,554
not reversed it.
What happened is that we as Americans 

2033
01:25:36,091 --> 01:25:38,770
supported one of the most,
you know,

2034
01:25:38,890 --> 01:25:41,800
I would say contentious political and 
social programs,

2035
01:25:41,801 --> 01:25:42,634
which was the great society where we 
deincentivize the black community from 

2036
01:25:45,601 --> 01:25:46,434
making good choices.
We incentivized women to say single and 

2037
01:25:49,661 --> 01:25:50,494
have babies.
We destroyed public sector education by 

2038
01:25:53,831 --> 01:25:54,664
reinforcing the public sector,
teacher unions and disallowing school 

2039
01:25:57,791 --> 01:25:58,624
choice.
I'm rewarding bad teachers and keeping 

2040
01:26:00,580 --> 01:26:02,800
communities perpetually poor.
Um,

2041
01:26:02,840 --> 01:26:06,590
we I think really did a disservice by 
um,

2042
01:26:06,910 --> 01:26:08,720
starting this war on police in the last 
couple of years,

2043
01:26:08,721 --> 01:26:09,554
which most police officers are there for
the betterment of the communities that 

2044
01:26:11,871 --> 01:26:12,704
they police.
And we have started this narrative that 

2045
01:26:14,361 --> 01:26:15,194
America somehow an inherently racist 
country and African Americans are poor 

2046
01:26:17,841 --> 01:26:19,010
because we're a racist country.

2047
01:26:19,250 --> 01:26:22,340
The data does not reflect that.
It's because we have created a,

2048
01:26:22,550 --> 01:26:23,383
a set of government policies and ideas 
that have not incentivized African 

2049
01:26:27,590 --> 01:26:28,423
Americans to continue,
like make good choices that breakout of 

2050
01:26:30,021 --> 01:26:31,700
poverty.
And as Ben Shapiro says,

2051
01:26:31,701 --> 01:26:35,630
you make these three choices.
You get married before you have kids,

2052
01:26:35,690 --> 01:26:37,280
you graduate high school and you get a 
job.

2053
01:26:37,340 --> 01:26:39,740
You can break out of poverty in this 
country and we,

2054
01:26:39,760 --> 01:26:41,450
and you can look to all three of those 
things.

2055
01:26:41,750 --> 01:26:42,583
We have government programs that either 
discouraged or deincentivize every one 

2056
01:26:46,251 --> 01:26:47,084
of those choices,
especially for African American 

2057
01:26:48,291 --> 01:26:52,840
community and candace growing up from 
the poor family growing up as a,

2058
01:26:52,841 --> 01:26:53,674
you know,
African American woman in this culture 

2059
01:26:54,971 --> 01:26:57,170
and the society can talk about it a lot 
better than I can.

2060
01:26:57,171 --> 01:26:58,790
I can only talk about it from an 
outsider.

2061
01:26:58,940 --> 01:27:01,580
She's an insider,
which in today's time unfortunately buys

2062
01:27:01,581 --> 01:27:03,110
you a lot more institutional 
credibility,

2063
01:27:03,290 --> 01:27:04,220
which it really shouldn't.

2064
01:27:04,490 --> 01:27:05,630
I mean that's the irony.
It's,

2065
01:27:05,631 --> 01:27:06,464
it's,
it's sort of using identity politics 

2066
01:27:08,060 --> 01:27:09,530
against itself.
Would you almost half,

2067
01:27:09,590 --> 01:27:11,510
which you almost have to do it because 
if,

2068
01:27:11,570 --> 01:27:12,620
for example,
you always say this,

2069
01:27:12,621 --> 01:27:15,440
if I say free enterprise is the greatest
way to solve poverty,

2070
01:27:15,650 --> 01:27:16,483
and candace says it,
it doesn't make it any more or less are 

2071
01:27:17,841 --> 01:27:19,640
true just because she's a black woman.
Right?

2072
01:27:19,730 --> 01:27:21,320
Truth is truth.
No matter who says it,

2073
01:27:21,321 --> 01:27:23,510
but the left somehow has a value,
you know,

2074
01:27:23,600 --> 01:27:24,433
um,
a lot higher of certain people saying 

2075
01:27:25,701 --> 01:27:26,450
it.
But you know what,

2076
01:27:26,450 --> 01:27:28,370
if identity politics is what we have to 
play,

2077
01:27:28,371 --> 01:27:30,770
then so be it.
And candace understands that,

2078
01:27:30,771 --> 01:27:31,604
especially on college campuses.
Black students will listen to her a lot 

2079
01:27:33,561 --> 01:27:34,394
more likely than they'll listen to me 
and I believe that she can continually 

2080
01:27:37,251 --> 01:27:38,084
build a movement around these core set 
of ideas and values and principles and 

2081
01:27:40,581 --> 01:27:41,150
she gets it.

2082
01:27:41,150 --> 01:27:43,400
Cause she used to be one of them.
She used to be a leftist.

2083
01:27:43,490 --> 01:27:44,323
She understands who these people are and
she understands how to fight them and 

2084
01:27:46,161 --> 01:27:46,994
how to persuade.
And we're lucky to have her as our 

2085
01:27:48,561 --> 01:27:50,690
director of urban engagement at turning 
point USA.

2086
01:27:50,810 --> 01:27:54,230
I know you don't like drug references,
but when I had her on I said,

2087
01:27:54,231 --> 01:27:56,480
you know,
for me it was like the red pill is like,

2088
01:27:56,481 --> 01:28:01,481
I was like slowly drinking it like tea.
She said she snorted it all the power to

2089
01:28:02,931 --> 01:28:03,764
hurt you as long as done in the harm.
Someone else do whatever you want to do 

2090
01:28:05,631 --> 01:28:06,464
with your life.
I want it to end with you in a slightly 

2091
01:28:08,121 --> 01:28:09,380
awkward position.
Here we go.

2092
01:28:09,381 --> 01:28:10,790
One of your employees that,
there we go.

2093
01:28:11,450 --> 01:28:13,400
It's very good.
You're doing great stuff.

2094
01:28:13,401 --> 01:28:14,920
I'm thinking forward to,
uh,

2095
01:28:15,380 --> 01:28:17,690
getting out on the road with you and 
what you're doing.

2096
01:28:17,690 --> 01:28:21,260
I'm awesome at the end of that week 
because you were smiling.

2097
01:28:21,261 --> 01:28:22,460
So I'm like,
I literally,

2098
01:28:22,461 --> 01:28:24,170
at one point,
I could not smile anymore.

2099
01:28:24,171 --> 01:28:24,830
I can't,
we're,

2100
01:28:24,830 --> 01:28:26,270
we're in our students.
Just great.

2101
01:28:26,271 --> 01:28:27,104
I mean,
they were just,

2102
01:28:27,170 --> 01:28:29,120
and by the way,
speaking of standing ovations,

2103
01:28:29,121 --> 01:28:30,740
I mean,
candice got a massive,

2104
01:28:31,100 --> 01:28:32,890
massive ovation.
Should be about a cent.

2105
01:28:32,900 --> 01:28:34,160
I mean,
here's the thing,

2106
01:28:34,190 --> 01:28:37,730
that's the diversity of ideas is we will
give a standing ovation of people,

2107
01:28:37,731 --> 01:28:41,150
even if we don't agree with what they 
have to say completely.

2108
01:28:41,390 --> 01:28:42,230
Right.
And that's,

2109
01:28:42,350 --> 01:28:43,970
the left won't do that.
It's like,

2110
01:28:44,030 --> 01:28:45,470
get out of my room,
get out of mice,

2111
01:28:45,650 --> 01:28:46,940
get out of our,
you know,

2112
01:28:46,970 --> 01:28:48,200
lecture hall.
And,

2113
01:28:48,201 --> 01:28:49,034
uh,
it's a movement around true tolerance 

2114
01:28:50,630 --> 01:28:52,760
and true discussion of ideas and we're 
going to win.

2115
01:28:53,270 --> 01:28:53,961
All right,
well,
