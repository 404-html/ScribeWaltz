00:00:02,610 --> 00:00:03,443
Dave rubin report,
I've been really inspired by the 

2
00:00:05,191 --> 00:00:06,024
reaction to the interview with Sam.
I knew that I felt really passionately 

3
00:00:08,670 --> 00:00:09,503
about the issues we talked about and 
needed to address the campaign to 

4
00:00:11,941 --> 00:00:14,580
discredit him and I knew a lot of other 
people felt the same way,

5
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:15,713
but I think I actually underestimated 
just how badly people wanted this 

6
00:00:18,301 --> 00:00:19,134
conversation to happen,
from Youtube comments to the tweets to 

7
00:00:22,051 --> 00:00:25,650
people who wrote me literally pages of 
thoughts on facebook and email.

8
00:00:25,830 --> 00:00:26,663
There was a real sense that it was 
cathartic for people who were feeling 

9
00:00:28,651 --> 00:00:29,484
the same thing I was.
That's exactly what I want this show to 

10
00:00:31,411 --> 00:00:32,244
be,
so I'm really proud that we got off to 

11
00:00:33,691 --> 00:00:34,524
the right start.
If we're going to build some kind of 

12
00:00:35,701 --> 00:00:36,534
community here based on the principles 
that I laid out last week and put an 

13
00:00:38,881 --> 00:00:40,590
action in the interview with Sam.

14
00:00:40,590 --> 00:00:42,450
I think I have to ask something of you 
now.

15
00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:45,390
Many of you were giving me Kudos for 
having an honest dialog,

16
00:00:45,391 --> 00:00:49,140
but if we really want to change things,
it's going to have to be way bigger than

17
00:00:49,141 --> 00:00:51,240
just me.
I'm sure some of you know that I'm gay.

18
00:00:51,270 --> 00:00:53,640
Actually.
I got gay married two weeks ago,

19
00:00:53,641 --> 00:00:54,474
which is pretty gay.
It's pretty much the gayest thing you 

20
00:00:56,101 --> 00:00:56,934
can do.
I don't really bring it up anymore 

21
00:00:57,751 --> 00:00:58,584
unless it's related to something in the 
news and I don't want any extra credit 

22
00:01:01,021 --> 00:01:03,180
for it or anything like that.
We got a quality.

23
00:01:03,181 --> 00:01:04,710
There's still work to do,
uh,

24
00:01:04,740 --> 00:01:06,630
but we've done great things that are 
moving forward.

25
00:01:06,631 --> 00:01:09,840
That's how progress is supposed to work.
A couple of years ago,

26
00:01:09,841 --> 00:01:12,960
I hosted a podcast and a Sirius xm show 
called the six pack.

27
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:13,973
It was a pop culture,
a new show with celebrity guests aimed 

28
00:01:16,141 --> 00:01:17,580
at the lgbt community.

29
00:01:17,940 --> 00:01:18,773
The show was really different than most 
gay culture out there and that it was 

30
00:01:20,971 --> 00:01:23,130
hosted by two guys who just happened to 
be gay,

31
00:01:23,310 --> 00:01:25,320
but we didn't make everything about 
being gay.

32
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:26,393
I mentioned this because we used to get 
a ton of email from people saying how 

33
00:01:28,501 --> 00:01:30,570
much we were helping them come to terms 
with themselves.

34
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:31,613
Come out of the closet,
talk to friends and family and all that 

35
00:01:33,571 --> 00:01:35,130
stuff.
Even more than that though,

36
00:01:35,131 --> 00:01:35,964
we got a ton of email from people saying
they were still closeted and our show 

37
00:01:38,971 --> 00:01:42,750
was there only gay outlet one day.
This strange paradox hit me,

38
00:01:42,870 --> 00:01:45,540
the people that we were helping the most
by doing the show,

39
00:01:45,541 --> 00:01:46,374
the people who are closeted and had no 
other outlet where the same people who 

40
00:01:49,411 --> 00:01:50,244
helped us as a show the least and that 
they couldn't tweet about us or share 

41
00:01:53,850 --> 00:01:56,970
posts about us on facebook or even tell 
their friends about us.

42
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:57,953
I really struggled with this in my 
relationship to the audience because I 

43
00:02:00,121 --> 00:02:00,954
knew that closeted life all too well and
I know that if the situation had been 

44
00:02:04,231 --> 00:02:06,240
reversed,
I would have been one of those people.

45
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:07,793
Like I said before,
I think we're onto something really 

46
00:02:09,121 --> 00:02:11,160
special here.
We're going to be part of something that

47
00:02:11,161 --> 00:02:15,720
takes back liberalism for true liberals,
but to do that we have to be louder.

48
00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:16,583
We have to be braver and bolder to save 
what we think and share it with the 

49
00:02:19,411 --> 00:02:20,244
people we know.
I noticed a lot of the people with the 

50
00:02:22,051 --> 00:02:22,884
word atheism in their usernames have 
anonymous profiles on twitter and some 

51
00:02:26,011 --> 00:02:28,320
even on facebook.
We all have our reasons,

52
00:02:28,321 --> 00:02:30,390
and I'm not passing judgment on anyone 
here,

53
00:02:30,510 --> 00:02:31,343
but think about that for a woman in 2015
atheists are one of the last groups of 

54
00:02:35,161 --> 00:02:38,340
people that feel like they have to be 
anonymous when they say what they really

55
00:02:38,341 --> 00:02:39,174
feel.

56
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:40,013
Again,
this isn't everybody or even the 

57
00:02:40,981 --> 00:02:43,560
majority,
but it seems to be a bigger portion than

58
00:02:43,561 --> 00:02:45,360
it should be and believe me,
I get it.

59
00:02:45,361 --> 00:02:46,194
I was closeted for a long time.
You might have family that won't accept 

60
00:02:48,181 --> 00:02:49,014
you as an atheist or maybe your 
community won't or maybe you aren't 

61
00:02:51,361 --> 00:02:52,194
fully sure what you are.
I don't want to make this just about 

62
00:02:53,910 --> 00:02:56,790
atheists though.
I think all of us secular people have to

63
00:02:56,791 --> 00:02:57,624
be seen and heard more.
Let's not just talk about it with each 

64
00:03:00,011 --> 00:03:00,844
other.
Let's get other people in on the 

65
00:03:01,781 --> 00:03:02,614
conversation too.
We don't need to go out and find 

66
00:03:04,391 --> 00:03:05,224
converts.
They'll find us because that's what 

67
00:03:06,371 --> 00:03:09,400
humanism and secular realism does.
By default,

68
00:03:09,430 --> 00:03:12,070
we just have to be louder.
It's not going to be easy.

69
00:03:12,071 --> 00:03:12,904
All three of the people who sam and I 
talked about who continuously 

70
00:03:15,191 --> 00:03:16,024
misrepresented him,
I've done so again publicly since our 

71
00:03:18,041 --> 00:03:18,730
interview.

72
00:03:18,730 --> 00:03:21,280
Feel free to check out my twitter feed 
to see the latest nonsense.

73
00:03:21,580 --> 00:03:23,470
These people are simply not going to 
stop.

74
00:03:23,740 --> 00:03:26,800
If we want to be heard,
we have to clearly fight back with logic

75
00:03:26,801 --> 00:03:28,390
on our side,
so if you hear me,

76
00:03:28,391 --> 00:03:31,570
if you dig what we've started here and 
you wanted to get bigger and better than

77
00:03:31,571 --> 00:03:32,920
like share,
comment,

78
00:03:32,921 --> 00:03:34,690
post,
and do whatever the hell else there is.

79
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:38,770
The forces of anti-intellectualism and 
radicalism are always on the march.

80
00:03:38,771 --> 00:03:42,070
Let's get our voices heard so that we 
can win not by violence,

81
00:03:42,071 --> 00:03:44,080
but by ideas.
Remember,

82
00:03:44,081 --> 00:03:44,914
as Obi wan said to luke,
the forest is what gives a jetta his 

83
00:03:46,901 --> 00:03:47,734
power.
It's an energy field created by all 

84
00:03:49,121 --> 00:03:51,880
living things.
It surrounds us and penetrates us.

85
00:03:51,881 --> 00:03:52,714
It binds the galaxy together,
but if you don't post about it on 

86
00:03:54,701 --> 00:03:55,750
facebook,
nobody will know.

87
00:03:58,570 --> 00:03:59,403
Carrie.
Santa Maria is the host and producer of 

88
00:04:00,521 --> 00:04:01,354
the talk,
nerdy podcast cohost of the skeptics 

89
00:04:03,731 --> 00:04:04,564
guide to the universe La area.
Emmy Award winning reporter for so cal 

90
00:04:08,051 --> 00:04:08,884
connected on Casey,
he t and science correspondent for tech 

91
00:04:11,651 --> 00:04:14,980
now on Al Jazeera America,
but most importantly she's my friend.

92
00:04:15,010 --> 00:04:16,750
Kara,
welcome to the show.

93
00:04:17,050 --> 00:04:19,270
Hey Man,
your resume is blowing up.

94
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:20,640
Huh?
Getting kind of crazy.

95
00:04:20,650 --> 00:04:21,483
You got a lot of stuff going on.
All sciency stuff and you are my 

96
00:04:24,490 --> 00:04:26,890
sciencey girl.
I'm the Goto.

97
00:04:26,980 --> 00:04:27,890
Yeah,
you are my go do.

98
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:28,733
So I thought you'd be a perfect second 
guest to have on the show because you 

99
00:04:30,041 --> 00:04:31,960
know we had Sam Harris on last week.
Also.

100
00:04:31,961 --> 00:04:33,530
Scientists also assigned.
Yeah.

101
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:37,060
It's actually like really a scientist.
I'm not really a scientist like Sam.

102
00:04:37,100 --> 00:04:39,530
Is he more of a scientist?
He's a neuroscientist.

103
00:04:39,590 --> 00:04:40,280
Yeah,
Sam.

104
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:41,113
Sam actually finished the Phd.
He took time off to write his first 

105
00:04:43,311 --> 00:04:44,144
book,
but then he actually went back and 

106
00:04:44,661 --> 00:04:45,494
finished.
I took time off and just kept taking 

107
00:04:47,001 --> 00:04:49,260
time off.
So I got the masters.

108
00:04:49,460 --> 00:04:51,450
But you're my girl.
I know you.

109
00:04:51,780 --> 00:04:52,613
Communicator

110
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:53,953
communicators.
That's where I wanted to start actually 

111
00:04:55,110 --> 00:04:58,380
because right under your name right now 
it says science communicator.

112
00:04:58,710 --> 00:05:00,570
So what is a science community?

113
00:05:00,570 --> 00:05:01,410
Okay.
Do you know?

114
00:05:01,411 --> 00:05:02,244
I think more than anything is just a 
catch all term that a lot of people in 

115
00:05:04,951 --> 00:05:09,951
my profession you so it could mean that 
you communicate science as an author,

116
00:05:10,020 --> 00:05:12,900
maybe you're a blogger,
maybe you give talks,

117
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:13,913
maybe you do what I do,
which is more in front of the camera 

118
00:05:15,331 --> 00:05:17,520
work or even some production work behind
it.

119
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:20,280
So sometimes it takes a more 
journalistic flare,

120
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:21,233
sometimes it takes more of an 
entertainment flare and those are two 

121
00:05:23,581 --> 00:05:24,414
very different camps,
but it all falls within that science 

122
00:05:26,011 --> 00:05:26,844
communication umbrella.
I mean the main goal is to help 

123
00:05:29,070 --> 00:05:31,260
communicate scientific principles to the
public,

124
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:32,273
help improve science literacy and do a 
little bit of translation because 

125
00:05:35,371 --> 00:05:39,810
sometimes scientists aren't very good at
liaising with the public.

126
00:05:39,811 --> 00:05:41,460
Sometimes they're amazing and I love 
that.

127
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:43,500
Sometimes they need a little bit of help
and so that's,

128
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:44,850
that's where people like I come in,

129
00:05:44,930 --> 00:05:45,763
right?
And I think sometimes people on my side 

130
00:05:47,301 --> 00:05:48,134
of it,
I need help and that's why I always 

131
00:05:49,371 --> 00:05:50,204
bring you on to,
to clean up some of the scientific 

132
00:05:52,041 --> 00:05:54,260
message.
I'm better at English,

133
00:05:54,261 --> 00:05:55,094
but you,
you helped me clean up some of that 

134
00:05:55,701 --> 00:05:56,870
stuff.
So obviously we,

135
00:05:57,380 --> 00:05:58,213
some of our older audience that's going 
to here have heard some of what we're 

136
00:06:00,171 --> 00:06:01,004
going to do here,
but we have a whole bunch of new people 

137
00:06:02,211 --> 00:06:03,740
that I think are going to really dig 
this.

138
00:06:03,741 --> 00:06:05,390
So I want to get to the science stuff 
later,

139
00:06:05,391 --> 00:06:08,430
but I wanna start with atheism because 
you're also my main atheist.

140
00:06:08,850 --> 00:06:11,420
You and Jacqueline Glenn are my two main
atheist.

141
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:13,250
Um,
so first off,

142
00:06:13,550 --> 00:06:14,383
uh,
why don't we do some basic definitions 

143
00:06:15,681 --> 00:06:16,930
here?
This might be tough.

144
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:19,680
It's going to be tough.
I think you can handle the atheism.

145
00:06:19,681 --> 00:06:21,230
Burse agnosticism.

146
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:22,530
Yeah.
So I mean,

147
00:06:22,590 --> 00:06:27,390
technically agnosticism is,
if you just break down the word,

148
00:06:27,391 --> 00:06:28,560
it's not knowing,
right?

149
00:06:28,561 --> 00:06:30,540
A lot of people self identify as 
agnostics.

150
00:06:30,541 --> 00:06:33,540
If they say,
I'm not sure if there's a greater power,

151
00:06:33,541 --> 00:06:37,740
I'm not sure what happens after you die.
And I don't want a hedge any bets.

152
00:06:38,130 --> 00:06:38,963
Now.
I personally think that the label 

153
00:06:40,801 --> 00:06:45,801
agnostic is redundant because you know,
whether you're a theistic or theistic,

154
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:48,390
whether you're a believer or a 
nonbeliever.

155
00:06:48,391 --> 00:06:53,020
I said this backwards,
nobody knows if you claim to know,

156
00:06:53,021 --> 00:06:55,000
like you're full of shit.
No,

157
00:06:55,050 --> 00:06:56,260
you don't know things.
I don't know.

158
00:06:56,261 --> 00:06:57,520
You don't have powers.
I don't have.

159
00:06:57,530 --> 00:06:58,363
I don't.
The people who scream about out at the 

160
00:06:58,911 --> 00:07:01,070
most,
they usually seem to to know the least.

161
00:07:01,130 --> 00:07:02,120
Yeah.
Actually,

162
00:07:02,121 --> 00:07:04,280
there are some studies that confirm 
that,

163
00:07:04,281 --> 00:07:05,114
so.
So I think of myself as an agnostic or 

164
00:07:08,801 --> 00:07:09,634
I'm sorry,
an atheistic agnostic and some people 

165
00:07:11,441 --> 00:07:12,274
are theistic agnostics,
meaning that I don't factor God into my 

166
00:07:16,451 --> 00:07:19,510
daily life.
I simply do not believe that God exists.

167
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:22,480
Yeah.
But I don't know if you have morals,

168
00:07:22,481 --> 00:07:26,680
if it's coming from somebody up.
There were two morals come from,

169
00:07:26,870 --> 00:07:27,570
well,
how do we get,

170
00:07:27,570 --> 00:07:32,570
have morals,
morals come to be a pretty moral person.

171
00:07:32,771 --> 00:07:34,920
I'm pretty forthright person.
How do you.

172
00:07:34,990 --> 00:07:36,190
That's very nice of you to say,
okay,

173
00:07:36,270 --> 00:07:37,103
that's true,
but,

174
00:07:37,180 --> 00:07:38,013
but how do you navigate the sort of 
moral divide if you're not getting it 

175
00:07:40,051 --> 00:07:41,970
from,
from some old book with some numbers,

176
00:07:42,020 --> 00:07:43,460
right?
Because I was raised Mormon too.

177
00:07:43,461 --> 00:07:45,380
Let's not forget that we're getting to 
that.

178
00:07:45,410 --> 00:07:47,720
And then I left the church.
So not only,

179
00:07:47,721 --> 00:07:48,554
I'm like more of a heathen,
I'm kind of the worst criminal within 

180
00:07:51,021 --> 00:07:55,130
the churches viewpoint because I 
actually accepted Jesus was baptized and

181
00:07:55,131 --> 00:07:55,964
then rejected it,
which is way worse than never having it 

182
00:07:57,891 --> 00:07:58,760
to begin with.
Right?

183
00:07:59,390 --> 00:08:01,100
Um,
where do I get morals?

184
00:08:01,101 --> 00:08:04,460
I get morals from literature,
I get morals from ethics courses,

185
00:08:04,461 --> 00:08:06,120
I get morals from,
you know,

186
00:08:06,650 --> 00:08:07,483
see I get morals from interacting with 
people and looking at their struggles 

187
00:08:11,661 --> 00:08:15,800
and trying to put myself in people's 
shoes and trying to understand the human

188
00:08:15,801 --> 00:08:16,720
experience.
I mean,

189
00:08:17,210 --> 00:08:18,043
we are innately empathetic creatures.
We are innately moral creatures and the 

190
00:08:24,681 --> 00:08:29,450
more that we can kind of embrace others,
the more that we can try to,

191
00:08:29,451 --> 00:08:30,284
I think remove the US them paradigm,
which is also very human and it's also 

192
00:08:36,471 --> 00:08:38,120
very difficult to push past.

193
00:08:38,300 --> 00:08:39,133
But the more that we do that,
I think the more that we can live these 

194
00:08:42,381 --> 00:08:43,214
moral lives.
And a lot of people want to say that 

195
00:08:46,671 --> 00:08:49,610
morality is sort of a,
um,

196
00:08:50,510 --> 00:08:51,343
an outcome of religion.
Perhaps a religion is an outcome of 

197
00:08:55,261 --> 00:08:56,490
morality.
Sure,

198
00:08:56,491 --> 00:09:00,030
there are correlations between the two.
But as I often say,

199
00:09:00,090 --> 00:09:03,840
when we talk about science,
correlation does not imply causality.

200
00:09:03,870 --> 00:09:04,703
There's no way to prove that without 
religion we wouldn't have or that you 

201
00:09:08,461 --> 00:09:08,940
know,
that.

202
00:09:08,940 --> 00:09:09,773
Yeah.
Without religion we wouldn't have a 

203
00:09:11,551 --> 00:09:15,840
moral compass.
And it's actually pretty philosophically

204
00:09:15,841 --> 00:09:19,230
ludicrous to sink in those terms.
So.

205
00:09:19,231 --> 00:09:20,910
Okay.
So you are from Texas,

206
00:09:21,180 --> 00:09:22,890
as you just said,
you grew up Mormon.

207
00:09:22,891 --> 00:09:26,790
So in the Mormon church,
when did you come out as atheist?

208
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:29,010
Yeah,
so if I'm remembering correctly,

209
00:09:29,011 --> 00:09:33,330
I came out when I was around 15 years 
old and it was like coming out.

210
00:09:33,330 --> 00:09:35,410
I mean,
how did the idea of general care,

211
00:09:35,430 --> 00:09:36,263
how did she feel about like actually 
having to say this thing and that's the 

212
00:09:39,061 --> 00:09:39,894
thing.
I actually had to say it because I 

213
00:09:40,681 --> 00:09:41,514
wasn't,
I didn't grow up in kind of a sort of 

214
00:09:43,291 --> 00:09:44,124
religious household.
I grew up in a very traditional Mormon 

215
00:09:46,261 --> 00:09:47,100
household.
So I,

216
00:09:47,190 --> 00:09:48,023
I remember telling my father I had been 
questioning for awhile and he had been 

217
00:09:51,061 --> 00:09:53,100
given me kind of the pat responses of 
like,

218
00:09:53,670 --> 00:09:56,480
you know,
pray about it and whatever.

219
00:09:56,520 --> 00:09:57,353
You'll figure it out on your own.
And when I would pray about it and 

220
00:09:59,881 --> 00:10:00,990
nothing would happen,
and then I was like,

221
00:10:00,991 --> 00:10:03,690
what am I doing?
I finally remember telling my father,

222
00:10:03,691 --> 00:10:06,060
you know,
I don't believe I don't believe,

223
00:10:06,061 --> 00:10:09,090
and I feel like I'm lying myself going 
to church every Sunday,

224
00:10:09,091 --> 00:10:09,924
every Wednesday,
every day before school going to 

225
00:10:11,491 --> 00:10:12,000
seminary.

226
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:16,230
It was a huge part of my life and it 
felt like a big ruse.

227
00:10:16,231 --> 00:10:17,064
I think much like somebody who is in the
closet and who is struggling trying to 

228
00:10:21,181 --> 00:10:24,110
act straight or trying to be somebody 
that they're not.

229
00:10:24,630 --> 00:10:27,810
And so I remember telling him and I 
remember these words,

230
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:30,233
as long as you live under my roof,
I have a moral obligation to God to 

231
00:10:34,081 --> 00:10:36,450
force you to go to church until you're 
18 years old.

232
00:10:36,570 --> 00:10:37,740
Wow.
So what do you do with that?

233
00:10:37,741 --> 00:10:40,620
As a 15 year old,
I didn't live under his roof anymore.

234
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,210
So it was a big choice.
You know,

235
00:10:42,211 --> 00:10:46,650
my parents had long been divorced and at
15 I remember saying to him,

236
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:47,873
you know,
technically I think I'm of an age of 

237
00:10:49,351 --> 00:10:50,184
consent where if we went to the 
courthouse and I pled my case that a 

238
00:10:53,401 --> 00:10:56,550
judge would say she can stay with her 
mom full time.

239
00:10:56,550 --> 00:10:57,480
It's her choice.
She's,

240
00:10:57,840 --> 00:10:58,673
you know,
she's old enough to make these kinds of 

241
00:10:59,701 --> 00:11:02,880
decisions.
And I was a pretty precocious kid.

242
00:11:02,881 --> 00:11:03,714
I'm sure I could have convinced the 
judge that I had thought about this 

243
00:11:05,641 --> 00:11:06,990
quite a bit,
which I had.

244
00:11:07,290 --> 00:11:09,540
And so my father said,
okay,

245
00:11:09,541 --> 00:11:10,374
he let me make that choice.
It was a difficult bind to be in and I 

246
00:11:12,781 --> 00:11:15,300
didn't talk to him for many years after 
that.

247
00:11:15,780 --> 00:11:18,090
Our relationship took a big hit and 
yeah,

248
00:11:18,091 --> 00:11:20,790
it took a long time for us to get back 
on good terms.

249
00:11:20,970 --> 00:11:21,803
So there's two really different but 
interesting pieces to that because 

250
00:11:24,871 --> 00:11:28,770
there's the choice that you made in your
own life to say this is who I am,

251
00:11:28,771 --> 00:11:30,930
but then there's this other piece of.
It's not easy for it,

252
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:32,790
for a 40 year old to say to their 
parents,

253
00:11:33,090 --> 00:11:36,040
I don't believe in what you believe,
much less a 15 year old.

254
00:11:36,450 --> 00:11:37,283
Maybe it's even easier for 15 year old 
because you're like rebellious at that 

255
00:11:39,961 --> 00:11:41,250
point anyway.
I mean,

256
00:11:41,251 --> 00:11:42,084
I'm not sure,
but that definitely I look back at the 

257
00:11:43,771 --> 00:11:46,170
gravity of that decision and I think 
like,

258
00:11:46,171 --> 00:11:48,450
Whoa,
that was pretty bold of me.

259
00:11:48,680 --> 00:11:49,513
Um,
I'm not sure if I felt that way at the 

260
00:11:50,491 --> 00:11:52,230
time.
How do you separate.

261
00:11:52,231 --> 00:11:54,070
One of the things we talked Sam about

262
00:11:54,070 --> 00:11:54,903
a lot with separating the doctrine of 
something from the people that follow 

263
00:11:59,801 --> 00:12:00,501
it.
So in the case we,

264
00:12:00,501 --> 00:12:01,334
Sam,
it was mostly about the doctrine of 

265
00:12:02,081 --> 00:12:05,260
Islam versus Muslim people.
So how do you now,

266
00:12:05,261 --> 00:12:06,094
after the experience that you had with 
your father believing what you believe 

267
00:12:08,411 --> 00:12:11,130
your whole career really is,
is very much based in this.

268
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:14,440
How do you separate the doctrine of 
mormonism?

269
00:12:14,441 --> 00:12:15,274
I'm sure you have many other family 
members that you love that are great 

270
00:12:16,811 --> 00:12:17,644
people and all that.
How do you separate that from the piece 

271
00:12:20,261 --> 00:12:22,300
of you that says,
I just don't believe in any of this?

272
00:12:22,810 --> 00:12:23,321
Yeah,
you know,

273
00:12:23,321 --> 00:12:25,090
I think it's,
it's for me,

274
00:12:25,091 --> 00:12:27,220
it's easy to separate for my own life,
right?

275
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:28,113
Like I can look at mormonism and I can 
look at my beliefs and I can say that's 

276
00:12:30,641 --> 00:12:31,474
bullshit and I don't believe in it,
but of course there are people that I 

277
00:12:33,431 --> 00:12:35,820
love who are like hook,
line and sinker.

278
00:12:35,830 --> 00:12:39,040
They buy into it and it's one thing to 
step back and say,

279
00:12:39,041 --> 00:12:41,230
you know,
they bought into bullshit,

280
00:12:41,590 --> 00:12:44,800
but it's another thing to actually say 
I'd still respect these people in there.

281
00:12:44,801 --> 00:12:45,601
Well,
you know,

282
00:12:45,601 --> 00:12:46,810
I don't come.
Yes,

283
00:12:46,811 --> 00:12:49,450
I come from Texas.
I don't come from like rednecks.

284
00:12:49,700 --> 00:12:52,030
You know,
my mother who is no longer more men,

285
00:12:52,031 --> 00:12:53,770
is an educator.
She's a school teacher.

286
00:12:53,771 --> 00:12:55,150
Recently retired.
My father,

287
00:12:55,151 --> 00:12:59,620
who still is very much mormon,
is an engineer and his wife who was also

288
00:12:59,621 --> 00:13:03,910
very much warman is a science teacher,
a very good science teacher.

289
00:13:04,150 --> 00:13:04,983
And so these are educated people who 
promote education and who are very good 

290
00:13:09,521 --> 00:13:11,860
parents adopted,
you know,

291
00:13:12,070 --> 00:13:13,330
adult.
Not Adult,

292
00:13:13,331 --> 00:13:14,164
but teenage children after we had moved 
out of the house like incredible people 

293
00:13:18,220 --> 00:13:19,053
and I love them dearly,
but we have a big disconnect when it 

294
00:13:22,541 --> 00:13:23,374
comes to belief now.
I don't think they need to believe what 

295
00:13:25,001 --> 00:13:27,040
I believe for us to get along and vice 
versa.

296
00:13:27,250 --> 00:13:30,190
It's one thing when you're in a parental
child situation,

297
00:13:30,220 --> 00:13:32,180
the rules are a bit different.
Um,

298
00:13:32,530 --> 00:13:33,363
but it is still tough because I think 
one of the things that you take with 

299
00:13:35,291 --> 00:13:36,124
you,
no matter how long after the 

300
00:13:37,811 --> 00:13:42,670
reconciliation happens,
is a bit of pity.

301
00:13:43,270 --> 00:13:45,640
A bit of like,
I,

302
00:13:45,740 --> 00:13:46,573
I know in my heart of hearts that I kind
of feel sorry that they lived this 

303
00:13:49,331 --> 00:13:50,590
lifestyle,
feel sorry for them,

304
00:13:50,591 --> 00:13:54,070
that they're sort of enslaved to these 
religious rules.

305
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:55,083
I feel sorry for them,
that they have to struggle with big 

306
00:13:58,060 --> 00:14:02,080
issues like accepting homosexuality in 
the family,

307
00:14:02,290 --> 00:14:03,123
for example,
and their church teaches them that this 

308
00:14:05,501 --> 00:14:07,810
is an abomination and it's so ingrained 
in them.

309
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:09,810
But I know they must struggle feeling 
like that,

310
00:14:10,390 --> 00:14:12,970
but I love this person.
How could that person be an abomination?

311
00:14:13,290 --> 00:14:14,123
Those I feel sorry for the,
the completely religiously inundated 

312
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:21,620
that they have to do that

313
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:24,210
pity for you to like they would look at 
you and go,

314
00:14:24,510 --> 00:14:25,343
well,
she doesn't have these incredibly 

315
00:14:26,581 --> 00:14:27,570
powerful beliefs.

316
00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:29,770
Oh Yeah,
my dad thinks I'm not going to heaven.

317
00:14:30,130 --> 00:14:32,400
Like,
well,

318
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:33,131
yeah,
exactly.

319
00:14:33,131 --> 00:14:33,964
And not especially not the celestial and
the terrestrial in heaven gets super 

320
00:14:36,611 --> 00:14:39,090
complicated in the Mormon faith.
But yeah,

321
00:14:39,100 --> 00:14:39,933
of course you feel sorry for me.
He thinks I'm not going to bathe in 

322
00:14:41,861 --> 00:14:42,694
God's glory for all of eternity.
That's like a pretty big deal to 

323
00:14:45,761 --> 00:14:48,610
somebody who actually believes that 
exist and you're not doing that

324
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:50,400
just as a private person.
You're doing it as well.

325
00:14:50,650 --> 00:14:51,530
Oh,
very publicly

326
00:14:52,250 --> 00:14:53,083
and interacting with a lot of people and
potentially influencing people and you 

327
00:14:57,021 --> 00:14:57,920
know,
it's um,

328
00:14:58,010 --> 00:15:00,870
I'm a heretic and that's,
you know,

329
00:15:00,950 --> 00:15:02,750
probably not something he's very proud 
of.

330
00:15:02,910 --> 00:15:03,743
Why do you think atheists are so hated?
I've seen poll after poll and we've 

331
00:15:07,591 --> 00:15:08,424
talked about them in some other shows 
that atheists are the most distrusted 

332
00:15:12,090 --> 00:15:13,710
group in America.
Uh,

333
00:15:13,890 --> 00:15:16,470
people would never vote for an atheist 
to be president.

334
00:15:16,730 --> 00:15:17,630
Um,
you know,

335
00:15:17,640 --> 00:15:18,870
Barney frank,
who came,

336
00:15:18,900 --> 00:15:21,060
who was a congressman from 
Massachusetts,

337
00:15:21,061 --> 00:15:21,894
a pretty liberal place,
came out as gay and something like 1983 

338
00:15:24,270 --> 00:15:25,103
didn't come out as an atheist until he 
was on real time with Bill Maher after 

339
00:15:28,051 --> 00:15:28,884
he had retired.
And since then has even backtrack a 

340
00:15:30,901 --> 00:15:32,940
little bit on saying that he was an 
atheist.

341
00:15:33,330 --> 00:15:34,163
What is it about atheist because the 
atheist that I know are pretty much by 

342
00:15:37,951 --> 00:15:42,000
and large,
the most decent sort of humanistic,

343
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:43,033
uh,
open people that I know and yet there's 

344
00:15:45,241 --> 00:15:46,920
this portrayal of them that's completely
true.

345
00:15:47,510 --> 00:15:50,570
I don't think it's that people think 
that atheists have horns or anything,

346
00:15:50,571 --> 00:15:51,081
you know,
I,

347
00:15:51,081 --> 00:15:52,190
I,
I think there's,

348
00:15:52,250 --> 00:15:53,083
there's racism and xenophobia and 
there's hate and there's fear and 

349
00:15:56,061 --> 00:15:56,894
there's all of the different things that
feed into why people don't trust or 

350
00:16:02,661 --> 00:16:03,494
don't like what they don't understand.
I think specifically though with 

351
00:16:06,951 --> 00:16:11,270
atheists,
you have to put yourself in the shoes of

352
00:16:11,271 --> 00:16:12,104
the religious to understand where this 
hatred comes from because of course 

353
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:16,033
nonreligious people don't have any 
problem with religious people running 

354
00:16:19,521 --> 00:16:21,970
for office office.
It's religious people from.

355
00:16:21,990 --> 00:16:22,611
Sorry,
nonreligious.

356
00:16:22,611 --> 00:16:24,680
People don't have any problem with 
atheists running for office.

357
00:16:24,890 --> 00:16:28,910
It's religious people that have a 
problem with that and think about,

358
00:16:28,911 --> 00:16:30,050
okay,
so for example,

359
00:16:30,770 --> 00:16:31,603
you're an upstanding gay man and there 
are moments when you have your moments 

360
00:16:34,821 --> 00:16:38,370
and there are some religious people who 
think that you are just Yuck,

361
00:16:38,900 --> 00:16:39,240
right?

362
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:42,530
Who think that like,
like being gay is disgusting like Edward

363
00:16:42,531 --> 00:16:43,364
[inaudible] book because that's what the
Bible teaches and so they have these 

364
00:16:46,071 --> 00:16:49,180
ideas in their head that your lifestyle 
is an abomination and blah,

365
00:16:49,190 --> 00:16:49,491
blah,
blah,

366
00:16:49,491 --> 00:16:52,460
and it is a choice and you could have 
chosen to live another way,

367
00:16:52,850 --> 00:16:53,683
but you're still a person and you're a 
flawed person and you've made a 

368
00:16:56,691 --> 00:16:59,060
difficult choice and maybe you can come 
back around.

369
00:16:59,570 --> 00:17:00,403
I think that there's something that 
really speaks to the core of the 

370
00:17:03,171 --> 00:17:04,004
structure of belief that an atheist,
as somebody who actively rejects the 

371
00:17:07,671 --> 00:17:08,504
foundation of what matters to these 
people and and that act is so closely 

372
00:17:14,631 --> 00:17:19,631
tied to what they think of as the devil,
what they think of as evil,

373
00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:25,550
what they think of as heresy.
All of these pure,

374
00:17:26,120 --> 00:17:30,080
just irrationally fearful states.
It's apostasy.

375
00:17:30,380 --> 00:17:32,480
It's,
it's what fuels Isis,

376
00:17:32,481 --> 00:17:32,780
right?

377
00:17:32,780 --> 00:17:33,613
It's,
it's worse than being a and Islamic 

378
00:17:36,830 --> 00:17:37,663
apostate.
It's worse than being a Christian 

379
00:17:39,021 --> 00:17:41,330
apostate.
It's being an atheist,

380
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:42,500
right?
It's the ultimate.

381
00:17:42,530 --> 00:17:43,363
It's the ultimate apostasy and I think 
that that's really where it comes from 

382
00:17:46,371 --> 00:17:49,830
and because of that historically 
generation generation,

383
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:50,873
I think we get a bad rap.
So you've got some people who are such 

384
00:17:52,891 --> 00:17:53,724
deep believers that there's no way 
they're going to come around to it and 

385
00:17:55,501 --> 00:17:59,790
then you've got other people who just 
equate the word atheism with like,

386
00:18:00,030 --> 00:18:01,710
I dunno,
just like bad stuff.

387
00:18:01,740 --> 00:18:03,470
Like they're criminals.
They're,

388
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:04,990
they're just like bad dudes.
Right?

389
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:05,370
So I want to get

390
00:18:05,370 --> 00:18:06,300
the new atheism.

391
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:07,233
Yeah.

392
00:18:07,350 --> 00:18:09,030
What do you think the other piece of 
this is?

393
00:18:09,031 --> 00:18:09,864
That to me it seems like because an 
atheist can come from any religious 

394
00:18:12,931 --> 00:18:13,910
background,
be any sex,

395
00:18:13,950 --> 00:18:15,780
but sexuality,
any nationality,

396
00:18:15,810 --> 00:18:16,643
all of those things that in a weird way 
what they fear is that this group of 

397
00:18:19,951 --> 00:18:24,360
people is coming together using sort of 
the best of all of us.

398
00:18:24,540 --> 00:18:25,980
You know what I mean?
Like they like that.

399
00:18:26,250 --> 00:18:27,083
They think that it's sorta like for gay 
people there are gay people of every 

400
00:18:29,461 --> 00:18:31,650
nationality and ethnicity and religion 
and all that,

401
00:18:31,770 --> 00:18:32,603
and that's why there's so much richness,
I think in the gay community and I'm 

402
00:18:34,561 --> 00:18:35,394
starting to think that that's what 
people fear about atheists to because 

403
00:18:37,861 --> 00:18:39,180
there's black atheist,
white atheist,

404
00:18:39,181 --> 00:18:40,014
atheist.

405
00:18:40,270 --> 00:18:42,370
Let's see.
This is something that I think intrinsic

406
00:18:42,371 --> 00:18:44,350
in what you just said,
the gay community,

407
00:18:44,380 --> 00:18:48,100
like the atheist community,
it exists.

408
00:18:49,030 --> 00:18:49,863
It exists,
but not to the same extent because I 

409
00:18:51,161 --> 00:18:51,994
think there's something that's sort of 
fundamental to being an atheist that 

410
00:18:57,340 --> 00:19:00,490
makes some people reject trying to find 
community.

411
00:19:00,790 --> 00:19:02,440
The whole point is that we're not a 
church.

412
00:19:02,441 --> 00:19:05,350
The whole point is that we just don't 
believe.

413
00:19:05,380 --> 00:19:06,213
It's not that we all believed the same 
thing is that we have a lack of belief 

414
00:19:08,741 --> 00:19:09,574
and I think that by definition that 
makes some people feel like we don't 

415
00:19:11,921 --> 00:19:14,980
need to band together.
There is no common thread here.

416
00:19:14,981 --> 00:19:16,540
It's just the default state.

417
00:19:16,550 --> 00:19:17,383
All right,
so that's exactly where I wanted to go 

418
00:19:18,321 --> 00:19:21,110
with this because new atheist,
that seems to be the new thing.

419
00:19:21,111 --> 00:19:22,970
So do you have a definition for new 
atheist?

420
00:19:23,060 --> 00:19:25,040
I can,
I can sort of tell you what I think,

421
00:19:25,041 --> 00:19:25,380
but

422
00:19:25,380 --> 00:19:27,750
I dunno.
I mean I think the new atheist is a term

423
00:19:27,751 --> 00:19:32,130
that's often used by non new atheist,
so it's sort of a derogatory term.

424
00:19:32,131 --> 00:19:32,964
So I'm not really sure how to define it 
because it seems like from the outside 

425
00:19:35,161 --> 00:19:37,470
people apply that label.
Who knows?

426
00:19:37,471 --> 00:19:38,910
Maybe I'm a new atheist.
I don't know.

427
00:19:39,060 --> 00:19:39,893
I do know that the term firebrand 
atheist is one that's actually kind of 

428
00:19:44,041 --> 00:19:46,590
um,
welcome within that community.

429
00:19:46,591 --> 00:19:49,140
So David Silverman,
who was president of American atheist,

430
00:19:49,290 --> 00:19:50,123
he has a new book coming out.
I actually wrote the foreword to his 

431
00:19:51,601 --> 00:19:52,434
book,
which is really funny because he's a 

432
00:19:53,971 --> 00:19:57,360
hardcore firebrand atheist and I'm like,
not at all.

433
00:19:57,690 --> 00:20:00,870
But I liked that he is one because I 
think it takes all types.

434
00:20:01,090 --> 00:20:01,690
Right.

435
00:20:01,690 --> 00:20:03,820
Firebrand though.
You mean like really outspoken?

436
00:20:04,070 --> 00:20:04,903
Oh yeah.
Like he doesn't think you can be an 

437
00:20:05,391 --> 00:20:06,370
atheist Jew,
right?

438
00:20:06,530 --> 00:20:07,363
Like he thinks you need to drop the 
juice I because how can you be both an 

439
00:20:09,711 --> 00:20:11,570
atheist energy or you have to,
you know,

440
00:20:11,660 --> 00:20:14,600
hold onto your atheist values and you 
have to be very open about it.

441
00:20:14,601 --> 00:20:17,330
Like we talked about this at length on 
my podcast and I'm like,

442
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:18,650
of course you can be an atheist,

443
00:20:18,730 --> 00:20:21,170
Sam Harris last week,
who's the one of the biggest alias.

444
00:20:21,171 --> 00:20:22,510
I know that,
that barely makes any sense.

445
00:20:24,210 --> 00:20:26,660
So aps,
so it doesn't believe in God,

446
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:28,113
but yeah,
I mean one of my best friends is an 

447
00:20:28,991 --> 00:20:33,430
atheist Jew and I get it like,
and he's Super Jewish and super atheist.

448
00:20:33,660 --> 00:20:37,150
Um,
and so I'm not a firebrand atheist.

449
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:41,020
I am really kind of accepting of 
people's religious beliefs.

450
00:20:41,021 --> 00:20:41,854
And I think that we need a spectrum of 
more secular values if we want to move 

451
00:20:45,611 --> 00:20:46,444
the goalpost.
But I think it's important that there 

452
00:20:48,161 --> 00:20:48,994
are firebrand atheist.
The same way that I think that it's 

453
00:20:50,201 --> 00:20:51,940
important that when you look at 
feminism,

454
00:20:52,360 --> 00:20:55,540
that there are men who hold onto 
feminist ideals,

455
00:20:55,720 --> 00:20:56,553
that there are women who are out loud 
and proud and in front of the line 

456
00:20:59,501 --> 00:21:00,334
talking about it,
and then there are women who act in a 

457
00:21:02,951 --> 00:21:03,784
feminist way,
but who don't make it their mission to 

458
00:21:05,411 --> 00:21:09,820
always be that feminist.
Same thing with black lives matter.

459
00:21:10,120 --> 00:21:10,953
Across the spectrum.
You need the people that are out in 

460
00:21:13,331 --> 00:21:15,400
front that are,
that are being loud,

461
00:21:15,430 --> 00:21:17,860
that are making sure that people pay 
attention to this movement,

462
00:21:18,070 --> 00:21:21,850
but you also need the people who quietly
live their lives that way every day.

463
00:21:21,940 --> 00:21:25,510
It's almost like we should have a broad 
spectrum of different things and can all

464
00:21:25,511 --> 00:21:28,720
still get along.
And exactly and the truth is if you have

465
00:21:28,750 --> 00:21:31,180
atheists have all these different 
flavors,

466
00:21:31,390 --> 00:21:34,930
then I think that you're going to see 
more people being affected.

467
00:21:34,931 --> 00:21:39,070
More people that are afraid to come out 
saying that person is just like me.

468
00:21:39,071 --> 00:21:42,640
Or I see myself in that person and I can
look at them as a role model.

469
00:21:42,820 --> 00:21:46,480
If we were all one flavor.
We would turn off a huge section of the

470
00:21:46,900 --> 00:21:47,733
and I think to sort of wrap this up,
I think that's sort of the people that 

471
00:21:50,911 --> 00:21:51,744
are.
Unfortunately it happens to be a lot of 

472
00:21:52,771 --> 00:21:55,000
people on the left that had been 
attacking new atheist.

473
00:21:55,350 --> 00:21:57,450
My friend Kyle Kalinsky said that a new 
atheist to him,

474
00:21:57,630 --> 00:21:58,463
it's just an atheist that finally saying
I'm an atheist because atheist used to 

475
00:22:01,290 --> 00:22:03,180
have to just not say anything.
It's true.

476
00:22:03,181 --> 00:22:06,570
And when I see these people on the left 
attacking new atheist as if new atheists

477
00:22:06,571 --> 00:22:07,404
have some set of beliefs,
all they have is this one thing in 

478
00:22:09,961 --> 00:22:11,630
common,
which is not belief,

479
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:12,570
not,
not a bigger sense.

480
00:22:12,610 --> 00:22:13,211
And I,
you know,

481
00:22:13,211 --> 00:22:14,044
I remember dating somebody a previously 
who I think was a little confused about 

482
00:22:18,371 --> 00:22:19,204
my atheism but was probably agnostic 
himself and I remember him saying 

483
00:22:23,171 --> 00:22:24,004
something about like,
I just don't understand why you have to 

484
00:22:24,971 --> 00:22:27,130
be so public about it.
I don't understand.

485
00:22:27,340 --> 00:22:29,290
It's a private matter.
Why are you always.

486
00:22:29,500 --> 00:22:31,480
And it's,
it's such a double standard.

487
00:22:31,710 --> 00:22:33,460
He's like,
are you kidding me?

488
00:22:33,490 --> 00:22:36,640
Religious people are like the most 
public people about their religion.

489
00:22:36,850 --> 00:22:40,840
And the fact that I want to say vocally,
I'm an atheist,

490
00:22:40,900 --> 00:22:41,733
I don't believe in God.
I don't factor God into my decision 

491
00:22:43,841 --> 00:22:46,090
making.
I don't believe in any afterlife.

492
00:22:46,091 --> 00:22:47,650
I don't believe in anything 
supernatural.

493
00:22:47,651 --> 00:22:49,540
I'm a science based,
evidence based thinker.

494
00:22:49,930 --> 00:22:50,763
The reason I do that is because then if 
I continue to live my life the way that 

495
00:22:53,801 --> 00:22:57,160
I hope I'm living in a moral way,
in an upstanding way,

496
00:22:57,430 --> 00:22:59,320
then people can look and go,
oh,

497
00:22:59,321 --> 00:23:01,810
that's what an atheist looks like.
Oh,

498
00:23:02,070 --> 00:23:02,903
I've been really inspired the last 
couple of weeks and I've been noticing 

499
00:23:04,651 --> 00:23:06,600
this over probably about six months or 
so.

500
00:23:06,630 --> 00:23:10,380
I sense a real awakening by secular 
people,

501
00:23:10,650 --> 00:23:11,483
not just atheist.
I mean people that are secular and that 

502
00:23:13,321 --> 00:23:14,820
they can have whatever belief that they 
want,

503
00:23:14,821 --> 00:23:17,610
but they want our public space,
our politics,

504
00:23:17,790 --> 00:23:21,390
and our public life to have nothing to 
do with religion.

505
00:23:21,690 --> 00:23:23,010
Do you,
do you sense this?

506
00:23:23,011 --> 00:23:24,690
Please tell me.
Yes.

507
00:23:24,691 --> 00:23:26,490
That there's been some kind of 
awakening.

508
00:23:26,540 --> 00:23:27,373
So like constitutionalist.
So like people who are coming back 

509
00:23:31,641 --> 00:23:35,030
around to 250 years ago.
Yes.

510
00:23:35,031 --> 00:23:35,990
No,
I definitely think so.

511
00:23:35,991 --> 00:23:36,824
I think that it,
it does come from more people being 

512
00:23:40,010 --> 00:23:41,960
willing to say that they're 
nonreligious.

513
00:23:41,990 --> 00:23:42,823
It's the largest growing minority in the
country and even though people who self 

514
00:23:46,521 --> 00:23:47,354
identify as atheist or shield though 
most hated group and trusted less than 

515
00:23:50,601 --> 00:23:52,520
rapists,
just totally crazy.

516
00:23:53,210 --> 00:23:54,043
People who are not religious are growing
in numbers and I think they're growing 

517
00:23:58,251 --> 00:23:59,084
in solidarity and even religious people 
who are saying are standing up for a 

518
00:24:04,371 --> 00:24:05,204
secular values and saying,
we need to promote a separation of 

519
00:24:08,331 --> 00:24:12,170
church and state and we need to move 
away from the Christian privilege.

520
00:24:12,171 --> 00:24:16,340
That is underlied our political 
structure for way too long now.

521
00:24:16,420 --> 00:24:19,990
Does it always strike you as odd that it
seems to me the religious right.

522
00:24:19,991 --> 00:24:20,824
On one hand they always scream about 
separation of church and state and then 

523
00:24:24,121 --> 00:24:28,150
they're the same ones that are always 
pushing religion into the conversation.

524
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:30,290
Did it really scream of etc.
I guess they do.

525
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:31,970
I don't want to listen to them very 
much.

526
00:24:32,360 --> 00:24:33,193
You something real quick.
Something like kim davis and huckabee 

527
00:24:36,270 --> 00:24:37,103
where he was telling people that she 
shouldn't abide by a law that she 

528
00:24:40,051 --> 00:24:41,040
doesn't believe in.

529
00:24:42,040 --> 00:24:43,080
Actually,
I guess that

530
00:24:43,220 --> 00:24:45,190
combining church and state,
I was given them a little bit.

531
00:24:47,170 --> 00:24:49,190
Just a quick aside with this whole kim 
davis,

532
00:24:50,180 --> 00:24:51,013
why do people care?
It's just like this is like the plane 

533
00:24:55,731 --> 00:24:57,230
crash over and over and over,
right?

534
00:24:57,231 --> 00:25:00,530
Like this has really no bearing on and 
if anything,

535
00:25:00,560 --> 00:25:05,300
this one woman is emblematic of how much
this movement is dying.

536
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:06,553
You know,
the fact that there's only one person 

537
00:25:08,001 --> 00:25:11,720
that they can point to and that 
everybody's rallying around her and it's

538
00:25:11,721 --> 00:25:12,554
a joke.
It's become such an eye roll and it to 

539
00:25:15,681 --> 00:25:16,514
me it's actually a good thing because 
it's showing me that it's becoming more 

540
00:25:20,121 --> 00:25:22,940
and more marginalized and we don't have 
to take them serious.

541
00:25:23,040 --> 00:25:23,520
Yeah.
You know,

542
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:24,353
I completely agree.
I think I've sent two tweets on the 

543
00:25:26,011 --> 00:25:26,844
whole kim davis thing,
which normally it would be like one of 

544
00:25:28,081 --> 00:25:28,914
my wheel house thing,
but it seems to me it's like we've won 

545
00:25:31,081 --> 00:25:32,360
this one.
We've won,

546
00:25:32,560 --> 00:25:33,393
right?
There's nothing that mike huckabee can 

547
00:25:34,681 --> 00:25:38,880
do to reverse this.
Even if god forbid he became president.

548
00:25:39,170 --> 00:25:41,250
I say that with you already.
He won't

549
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:43,273
himself.
Like he's doubling down on a nonissue 

550
00:25:46,120 --> 00:25:51,120
that's embarrassing,
that it's laughable and I think that the

551
00:25:51,671 --> 00:25:56,671
more that we put her in the spotlight 
and the more that we do the wall to wall

552
00:25:57,461 --> 00:25:58,294
cnn coverage about her,
the more it gives this false sense of 

553
00:26:00,671 --> 00:26:02,560
legitimacy that just doesn't exist.

554
00:26:02,710 --> 00:26:03,543
Right.
It's like the media is blowing it up to 

555
00:26:04,511 --> 00:26:06,850
be this thing where actuallY the average
person is like,

556
00:26:06,851 --> 00:26:07,631
you know what,
this,

557
00:26:07,631 --> 00:26:09,320
this is a dying dinosaur,
right?

558
00:26:09,560 --> 00:26:10,120
Yeah,
she is.

559
00:26:10,120 --> 00:26:12,460
She's a monologue joke.
that's all she is.

560
00:26:12,461 --> 00:26:13,294
You know.

561
00:26:13,490 --> 00:26:15,810
So one more on this sort of broad topic.
Um,

562
00:26:15,830 --> 00:26:16,520
so again,
I had,

563
00:26:16,520 --> 00:26:17,353
I had sam on last week and it's been 
really interesting for me to see what 

564
00:26:20,781 --> 00:26:25,781
happens when someone with a background 
in science gets involved in politics.

565
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:29,690
And I almost think that the,
if I have one critique of sam,

566
00:26:29,691 --> 00:26:30,524
it would be that he's placed himself in 
this really precarious position out of 

567
00:26:33,471 --> 00:26:35,210
his own bravery.
And as he said,

568
00:26:35,211 --> 00:26:38,810
it was at huge cost to him probably 
personally and professionally,

569
00:26:38,811 --> 00:26:40,250
I would imagine.
Um,

570
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:41,233
do you think it's hard for scientists or
should people have a science background 

571
00:26:44,671 --> 00:26:48,220
get involved in the political debate 
because it seems he's two.

572
00:26:48,290 --> 00:26:49,123
He in a lot of wayS,
he's too smart to be talking about the 

573
00:26:51,571 --> 00:26:54,840
way we talk about politics because 
politics is so dumbed down.

574
00:26:55,170 --> 00:26:56,003
I eat.
Donald trump is leading in the 

575
00:26:57,271 --> 00:26:58,030
republican party

576
00:26:58,030 --> 00:26:59,310
and it's a binary,
right?

577
00:26:59,320 --> 00:27:01,390
There's no room for nuance and political
debate,

578
00:27:01,391 --> 00:27:02,224
especially not in the eight second sound
bytes that we've grown use to and 

579
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:06,970
political media.
I don't know.

580
00:27:06,971 --> 00:27:07,804
I'm of two minds about this.
So I am a cohost on the sKeptic's guide 

581
00:27:11,801 --> 00:27:14,890
to the universe,
which is a popular science podcasts that

582
00:27:14,891 --> 00:27:18,340
really celebrates skepticism,
eviDenced based thinking,

583
00:27:18,520 --> 00:27:21,880
debunking medical quackery and things 
like that.

584
00:27:22,060 --> 00:27:24,430
And the host,
steven novella is,

585
00:27:24,431 --> 00:27:26,830
you know,
a renowned neuroscientist and a renowned

586
00:27:26,831 --> 00:27:27,664
skeptic and He has an edit.
He has made an editorial decision on 

587
00:27:30,881 --> 00:27:34,180
this show over the past 10 years,
which I just joined like two months ago,

588
00:27:34,540 --> 00:27:35,373
that we don't discuss politics,
that that's not relevant to the 

589
00:27:38,351 --> 00:27:40,960
scientific conversations.
Now on my podcast,

590
00:27:40,961 --> 00:27:45,961
I talk about politics all the time 
because I think that science is not just

591
00:27:46,120 --> 00:27:46,953
a topic that you study.
It's not just facts and figures in a 

592
00:27:49,610 --> 00:27:50,443
textbook,
but it's a way of thinking and it's a 

593
00:27:53,621 --> 00:27:54,454
way of utilizing the principles of the 
scientific method and looking at 

594
00:27:58,240 --> 00:28:01,780
evidence in order to make informed 
decisions.

595
00:28:01,780 --> 00:28:04,900
And so for me,
scientific thinking is the foundation of

596
00:28:04,901 --> 00:28:08,500
politics and if we could start moving 
into,

597
00:28:09,050 --> 00:28:09,883
um,
into kind of a direction where this 

598
00:28:12,011 --> 00:28:12,844
country is governed based on evidence 
and not based on as cold bear calls it 

599
00:28:17,110 --> 00:28:19,690
truthiness,
which is so often what we do.

600
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:22,450
Legislation passed because it gives you 
a gut check,

601
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:24,340
right?
Or because there's pork or you know,

602
00:28:24,341 --> 00:28:25,174
all those other reasons,
financial incentives and things like 

603
00:28:27,581 --> 00:28:28,414
that.
But so often we make strong legislative 

604
00:28:30,821 --> 00:28:31,654
decisions where there is evidence 
available to us and we don't base it on 

605
00:28:35,321 --> 00:28:36,154
the evidence.
And I think that if we started moving 

606
00:28:37,361 --> 00:28:38,194
more in that direction,
we'd have a much more functional 

607
00:28:40,301 --> 00:28:43,000
government and definitely a more 
functional economy.

608
00:28:43,240 --> 00:28:44,073
And so I would like to see more 
scientists moving into the political 

609
00:28:48,190 --> 00:28:49,023
arena.
But I can see why it would be 

610
00:28:50,291 --> 00:28:51,124
disconcerting if you are a functioning 
university scientists because you also 

611
00:28:54,520 --> 00:28:58,270
oftentimes receive federal money.
And so then things start to get a little

612
00:28:58,271 --> 00:29:00,070
bit confusing about where your 
allegiance lies.

613
00:29:00,071 --> 00:29:03,130
Now,
sam is not a university scientist.

614
00:29:03,131 --> 00:29:05,830
He was a trained academic,
but it doesn't work as an academic.

615
00:29:05,831 --> 00:29:08,860
He's an author.
He does political punditry now.

616
00:29:08,861 --> 00:29:09,694
I mean,
it's part of his job and I applaud him 

617
00:29:11,321 --> 00:29:12,154
for that even though he's on hit list.
I'm sure he's on hitlist because of 

618
00:29:16,031 --> 00:29:16,631
this,
you know,

619
00:29:16,631 --> 00:29:19,420
it's a choice that he made and I think 
it's a really brave choice.

620
00:29:19,710 --> 00:29:20,800
Um,
but yeah,

621
00:29:21,290 --> 00:29:22,490
I have no doubt he's on hitlist.
Yeah,

622
00:29:22,520 --> 00:29:25,110
there's like feed from today.
It's control.

623
00:29:25,210 --> 00:29:27,310
So gmos,
we talked about gmos before.

624
00:29:27,311 --> 00:29:32,311
Can you give me like a five minute sort 
of gmo one one you say you just say gmo.

625
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:36,860
People freak out.
They go monsanto and everyone goes.

626
00:29:36,861 --> 00:29:37,110
Yeah.

627
00:29:37,110 --> 00:29:40,380
And lately there's this added confusion 
because a scientist who I've interviewed

628
00:29:40,381 --> 00:29:43,150
many times,
multiple platforms named kevin folta has

629
00:29:43,151 --> 00:29:43,984
been in the news a lot because of a foya
requests that revealed some things that 

630
00:29:46,871 --> 00:29:47,704
people didn't want to see.
I'm mostly things that he never denied 

631
00:29:51,010 --> 00:29:52,210
anyway,
but,

632
00:29:52,211 --> 00:29:53,980
um,
and it wasn't a lot of money that he got

633
00:29:53,981 --> 00:29:54,814
and all that.
But thAt's a whole other ethics get 

634
00:29:56,411 --> 00:29:57,640
complicated.
um,

635
00:29:57,670 --> 00:29:58,960
but,
but regardless of that,

636
00:29:58,961 --> 00:30:01,120
if we're going to talk about the core of
gmos,

637
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:06,130
these other conversations really are 
irrelevant to this core conversation.

638
00:30:06,131 --> 00:30:07,610
Literally one.
Oh sure.

639
00:30:07,940 --> 00:30:09,340
No.
If you don't know anything about.

640
00:30:09,630 --> 00:30:11,290
So what is a gmo?
Well,

641
00:30:11,590 --> 00:30:12,423
technIcally the word genetically 
modified organism could refer to 

642
00:30:14,171 --> 00:30:16,720
anything,
any organism,

643
00:30:16,780 --> 00:30:19,390
anything that's alive in which the genes
have been modified.

644
00:30:19,391 --> 00:30:20,224
So basically breeding two plants 
together to try and get a desired trait 

645
00:30:23,620 --> 00:30:24,730
is technically gmo.

646
00:30:24,850 --> 00:30:27,520
Now that's not how we casually use the 
word anymore.

647
00:30:27,521 --> 00:30:32,521
We usually use the term gmo to actually 
refer to transgenic organism.

648
00:30:32,731 --> 00:30:33,564
So these are organisms where they 
weren't selectively bred for particular 

649
00:30:35,861 --> 00:30:36,694
traits,
but there was actually a transgene that 

650
00:30:38,141 --> 00:30:40,240
was inserted.
We've gotten into the laboratory,

651
00:30:40,241 --> 00:30:43,330
we've tested and we found these genetic 
markers,

652
00:30:43,331 --> 00:30:45,880
these areas where we can do something to
the plant.

653
00:30:46,060 --> 00:30:46,893
Generally we're talking about plants.
There are some animals that are up for 

654
00:30:48,911 --> 00:30:52,360
fda approval like salmon,
but generally we're talking about plants

655
00:30:52,660 --> 00:30:55,840
and scientists will say,
for example,

656
00:30:55,870 --> 00:30:59,560
this is a big one right now.
Citrus greening is wiping out oranges in

657
00:30:59,561 --> 00:31:00,910
Florida,
wiping them out.

658
00:31:01,030 --> 00:31:01,863
They're all really sick.
It's getting harder and harder to get 

659
00:31:03,401 --> 00:31:05,830
fresh oranges and this is a problem that
they don't see going away.

660
00:31:06,250 --> 00:31:09,850
Can we make oranges that are resistant 
to this disease?

661
00:31:10,120 --> 00:31:12,910
Because if we don't,
we may not have oranges anymore.

662
00:31:13,030 --> 00:31:13,863
So the scIentists work very hard to go 
into the genome to try and understand 

663
00:31:18,340 --> 00:31:19,173
all of these different genes within the 
plant and try and modify them in a 

664
00:31:21,551 --> 00:31:24,070
certain way.
Sometimes it involves taking a gene from

665
00:31:24,071 --> 00:31:27,790
another plant and inserting it.
Sometimes it involves turning a gene on,

666
00:31:28,090 --> 00:31:31,900
silencing the gene,
making a gene do something that maybe it

667
00:31:31,901 --> 00:31:34,180
wouldn't have done unless it was under 
pressure.

668
00:31:34,390 --> 00:31:36,190
Um,
there's a lot of different ways that you

669
00:31:36,191 --> 00:31:37,024
can genetically modify a plant,
but that's the things we've done for a 

670
00:31:39,431 --> 00:31:41,110
long time for all kinds of different 
plants.

671
00:31:41,140 --> 00:31:41,973
Oh yeah.
And there are literally thousands of 

672
00:31:44,770 --> 00:31:45,603
research versions of gmos,
but there are very few gmos that are on 

673
00:31:48,461 --> 00:31:51,430
the market and I think that's another 
big misconception.

674
00:31:51,730 --> 00:31:53,030
People you'll see,
you know,

675
00:31:53,150 --> 00:31:53,983
labels on crazy stuff,
like you'll see labels on potatoes that 

676
00:31:56,741 --> 00:31:58,710
are like gmo free and it's like,
well yeah,

677
00:31:58,711 --> 00:31:59,544
because there's no such thing as a gmo,
but they're not modifying it to stop 

678
00:32:03,581 --> 00:32:04,900
either bugs from eating.

679
00:32:04,940 --> 00:32:06,880
I mean they are in the lab but you can't
buy it yet.

680
00:32:06,940 --> 00:32:11,410
So the thing is the only crops that are 
available are mostly big ag crops.

681
00:32:11,411 --> 00:32:15,430
So corn is genetically modified.
Probably most of the corn that you eat.

682
00:32:15,730 --> 00:32:17,830
Soybeans,
sugar beets.

683
00:32:18,100 --> 00:32:22,240
I'm papaya is genetically modified.
Genetically modified.

684
00:32:22,241 --> 00:32:24,760
Apple Just came on the market or it's 
about to,

685
00:32:25,030 --> 00:32:25,863
um,
I think it's the okinawa apple at that 

686
00:32:27,361 --> 00:32:28,210
end.
It doesn't brown.

687
00:32:28,660 --> 00:32:30,820
You can take a bite out of it.
Depended on the table and the ground.

688
00:32:30,850 --> 00:32:33,430
It's pretty cool.
Did you try it?

689
00:32:33,490 --> 00:32:36,970
It tastes like an apple gross and weird.
I did not.

690
00:32:37,130 --> 00:32:37,661
We,
you know,

691
00:32:37,661 --> 00:32:38,494
you've eaten a lot of gmos your day and 
I don't see any appendages that aren't 

692
00:32:41,451 --> 00:32:43,880
supposed to be there.
All right.

693
00:32:44,130 --> 00:32:44,963
So,
so from that very sort of simplistic 

694
00:32:46,520 --> 00:32:47,353
explanation of what gmos are,
why do so many people hate gmos because 

695
00:32:51,051 --> 00:32:51,884
people are afraid of what they don't 
understand and there's a lot of 

696
00:32:53,511 --> 00:32:54,344
misinformation out there and so there 
are some legitimate concerns when it 

697
00:32:57,081 --> 00:32:59,270
comes to environmental consequences.

698
00:32:59,450 --> 00:33:00,283
I think probably the most legitimate 
concern when it comes to gmos is the 

699
00:33:03,470 --> 00:33:08,470
what is a normal outcome of evolution,
and I use the example of super bugs with

700
00:33:10,131 --> 00:33:12,410
antibiotics because I think it's a good 
analogy.

701
00:33:12,560 --> 00:33:13,393
so when we take antibiotics,
we actually induce resistance in the 

702
00:33:17,601 --> 00:33:18,434
bugs that can infect us and now there 
are whole classes of bugs that are 

703
00:33:20,751 --> 00:33:24,410
resistant to those antibiotics.
Just like in gmo plants,

704
00:33:24,530 --> 00:33:29,450
when you alter them to resist certain 
pests or to resist.

705
00:33:29,480 --> 00:33:30,313
I'm mostly with the past.
When you alter them to resist those 

706
00:33:32,181 --> 00:33:34,490
pests,
you may have new pests that devolve,

707
00:33:34,700 --> 00:33:37,280
that evolve,
a resistance to that resistance.

708
00:33:37,610 --> 00:33:40,760
You see it a little bit with weeds too,
liKe the glyphosate argument,

709
00:33:40,761 --> 00:33:42,890
which is roundup.
People are really scared of roundup.

710
00:33:42,950 --> 00:33:46,670
Bt is more the pes thing anD the 
glyphosate is more of the weed thing and

711
00:33:46,671 --> 00:33:48,170
people sometimes mix those things up.

712
00:33:48,440 --> 00:33:50,270
That's sort of where monsanto gets 
involved.

713
00:33:50,271 --> 00:33:52,220
But we were talking about cover that 
another time.

714
00:33:52,250 --> 00:33:52,731
sure,
sure.

715
00:33:52,731 --> 00:33:53,720
we're talking about,
you know,

716
00:33:53,721 --> 00:33:57,770
the potential for super weeds to grow 
because these plants are,

717
00:33:57,771 --> 00:34:00,140
um,
are helping them grow.

718
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:00,730
Uh,
it's,

719
00:34:00,730 --> 00:34:03,920
it's a natural process and it doesn't 
just happen in gm.

720
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:07,520
It happens anytime that you're doing 
large scale agriculture.

721
00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:09,650
And so I like to say to people,
you know,

722
00:34:09,651 --> 00:34:10,484
would you want to take all the 
antibiotics off the market because 

723
00:34:13,881 --> 00:34:15,690
they're making antibiotic resistance?
No,

724
00:34:15,740 --> 00:34:16,573
we need to be smarter about how we use 
them and we need to come up wIth new 

725
00:34:18,111 --> 00:34:18,944
antibiotics.
And so what scientists are actually 

726
00:34:20,451 --> 00:34:21,284
doing is they're trying to figure out 
new and better ways to improve 

727
00:34:24,591 --> 00:34:27,830
resistance to these different bugs.
Let's say that there is a,

728
00:34:27,831 --> 00:34:28,664
um,
a pesticide inside of a plant and the 

729
00:34:31,761 --> 00:34:32,594
bug,
it develops resistance to that 

730
00:34:33,531 --> 00:34:34,364
pesticide.

731
00:34:34,490 --> 00:34:35,323
Well,
if you actually alter that plant in two 

732
00:34:37,251 --> 00:34:38,084
ways,
now you have two lines of defense 

733
00:34:39,561 --> 00:34:40,394
against this bug.
It's statistically very unlikely that 

734
00:34:43,131 --> 00:34:43,964
you'll get a mutation in that bug 
against both of those lines of 

735
00:34:46,431 --> 00:34:47,264
resistance.
So now you can have a resistant plant 

736
00:34:48,621 --> 00:34:51,720
and you're less likely to see resistance
occurring in the bug.

737
00:34:51,721 --> 00:34:52,554
So,
you know,

738
00:34:53,090 --> 00:34:53,923
scientists are always trying to keep one
step ahead of nature and these are the 

739
00:34:57,231 --> 00:35:00,140
biggest problems that we're seeing with 
genetic modification.

740
00:35:00,590 --> 00:35:04,820
A lot of the problems that people think 
are happening with genetic modification,

741
00:35:05,300 --> 00:35:07,100
cancer,
you know,

742
00:35:07,640 --> 00:35:10,130
health problems,
what's a big one,

743
00:35:10,190 --> 00:35:14,240
seeds blowing into another field and 
getting sued for it.

744
00:35:14,580 --> 00:35:17,750
Um,
suicides in India,

745
00:35:18,440 --> 00:35:21,410
none of these are substantiated,
none of them.

746
00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:25,430
The science shows time and time again 
that these are not real concerns.

747
00:35:25,550 --> 00:35:26,383
And if you actually do dig into the case
law and you actually do try and 

748
00:35:28,611 --> 00:35:31,430
understand what has happened legally in 
these situations,

749
00:35:31,850 --> 00:35:36,850
most of those lawsuits with the big ag 
companies involve people storing,

750
00:35:37,320 --> 00:35:39,510
which is technically against the law.
Now,

751
00:35:39,511 --> 00:35:42,510
if you have a problem with,
you know,

752
00:35:42,540 --> 00:35:43,950
patenting a c right?

753
00:35:43,980 --> 00:35:45,530
Again,
it's a whole lot

754
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:49,660
if you have a problem with large scale 
agribusiness and you have a problem with

755
00:35:49,661 --> 00:35:54,340
the way that we dry out the land by only
farming a very particular crop,

756
00:35:54,580 --> 00:35:55,413
I get that.
But that has nothing to do with genetic 

757
00:35:57,941 --> 00:36:01,030
modification.
And I think we often conflate the issue.

758
00:36:01,031 --> 00:36:01,560
Yes,

759
00:36:01,560 --> 00:36:04,500
the topic of abortion never seems to go 
away.

760
00:36:04,660 --> 00:36:07,500
And I wanted to talk to you as someone 
of science and uh,

761
00:36:07,501 --> 00:36:09,750
as an atheist who obviously has no 
morals,

762
00:36:10,170 --> 00:36:11,850
how do you negotiate this?
Because,

763
00:36:12,140 --> 00:36:14,160
uh,
it seems to be the people on the left,

764
00:36:15,060 --> 00:36:15,893
when they talk about abortion,
they make it sound like everyone on the 

765
00:36:17,461 --> 00:36:20,730
right hates women and that they want to 
control women.

766
00:36:20,731 --> 00:36:22,170
And when people on the right talk about 
it,

767
00:36:22,171 --> 00:36:25,500
they make it sound like everyone on the 
left hates babies.

768
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:28,380
That's right.
And neither one of those things.

769
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:31,170
That's very obvious.
So how do you,

770
00:36:31,171 --> 00:36:34,410
as someone that comes to conclusions 
based on science,

771
00:36:34,680 --> 00:36:37,920
how do you navigate the sort of ethical.
I assume you're pro choice,

772
00:36:37,921 --> 00:36:39,600
but actually I'm just assuming that,
but is that.

773
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:42,593
How do you then as someone that's pro 
choice believes in edit and it's in 

774
00:36:45,811 --> 00:36:46,644
science,
how do you decide where like do you 

775
00:36:48,121 --> 00:36:50,610
think that it should be a two month cut 
off for an abortion?

776
00:36:51,170 --> 00:36:52,003
Where do you,
where do you come up with that as 

777
00:36:52,651 --> 00:36:54,930
someone that isn't coming from the 
religious angle,

778
00:36:55,380 --> 00:36:57,660
but it's coming from the science based 
angle.

779
00:36:57,710 --> 00:37:00,620
I'd say abortion should be legal up 
until 12 years old.

780
00:37:00,680 --> 00:37:05,420
Pro like until the brain is fully known,
I'm actually,

781
00:37:05,421 --> 00:37:08,990
that'd be more like 25 that's going to 
take off.

782
00:37:10,310 --> 00:37:11,143
You know,
it's funny because I am an evidence 

783
00:37:12,081 --> 00:37:12,914
based thinker.
I try to be an evidence based thinker 

784
00:37:14,361 --> 00:37:15,194
and a skeptical thinker and I try to 
listen to the science first and then 

785
00:37:18,651 --> 00:37:20,390
make my political decisions based on 
that.

786
00:37:20,391 --> 00:37:22,910
So I am liberal,
I am left wing,

787
00:37:22,911 --> 00:37:25,520
I am progressive.
I think it's easy to paint me in,

788
00:37:25,730 --> 00:37:29,270
but I'm also super provax mandatory 
vaccinations.

789
00:37:29,480 --> 00:37:30,770
I'm pro gmo is,
which is.

790
00:37:30,820 --> 00:37:33,520
It's usually a more conservative 
viewpoint,

791
00:37:33,670 --> 00:37:35,590
so sometimes it's hard to put me in a 
box.

792
00:37:35,800 --> 00:37:38,440
Now I'm.
I'm not pro life.

793
00:37:38,470 --> 00:37:40,710
I am proud life.
I hate that term.

794
00:37:40,711 --> 00:37:43,130
It makes it sound like I'm not.
I'm,

795
00:37:43,150 --> 00:37:46,490
I'm,
I am choice not because it's,

796
00:37:46,491 --> 00:37:47,324
it's partially because of the science 
and it's partially because I'm not 

797
00:37:48,881 --> 00:37:53,881
religious and I think that a lot of pro 
life ideology comes purely from religion

798
00:37:54,790 --> 00:37:56,980
and once you take religion out of the 
equation,

799
00:37:57,130 --> 00:37:59,920
it becomes a much more nuanced and 
complicated topic.

800
00:38:00,220 --> 00:38:01,053
I am pro choice,
meaning that I don't think that if a 

801
00:38:03,251 --> 00:38:04,084
woman wants to have an abortion,
she shouldn't be able to and I don't 

802
00:38:07,271 --> 00:38:09,640
think that if a woman wants to keep her 
baby,

803
00:38:09,641 --> 00:38:11,590
she should be coerced to have an 
abortion.

804
00:38:11,800 --> 00:38:12,633
I think that a woman should be able to 
make a decision based on her own body 

805
00:38:15,521 --> 00:38:16,354
and in my view,
which may sound kind of extreme until 

806
00:38:18,971 --> 00:38:21,640
that baby is born.
It's hers,

807
00:38:21,790 --> 00:38:22,623
it's her body.

808
00:38:22,650 --> 00:38:23,350
Right?
So I,

809
00:38:23,350 --> 00:38:25,230
I agree with you.
I guess up untiL that point,

810
00:38:25,231 --> 00:38:27,610
I'm absolutely pro choice but,
but uh,

811
00:38:27,611 --> 00:38:29,420
but a week before the birth,
I mean,

812
00:38:29,421 --> 00:38:30,120
yeah,

813
00:38:30,120 --> 00:38:33,750
I know that gets into your straw man 
argument because it doesn't happen.

814
00:38:34,020 --> 00:38:36,100
It's like the,
it's like the voter id stuff,

815
00:38:36,120 --> 00:38:37,660
you know,
like old voter fraud.

816
00:38:37,661 --> 00:38:40,750
We got to be careful about that.
Women don't carry babies to a week,

817
00:38:40,760 --> 00:38:42,880
determine the goal.
I think I'm gonna lose this baby

818
00:38:43,240 --> 00:38:45,310
facebook,
but so at three months when the baby now

819
00:38:45,311 --> 00:38:47,920
has features and you know,
all of these things,

820
00:38:48,220 --> 00:38:50,620
and I guess this is the slippery slope 
up to this point.

821
00:38:50,621 --> 00:38:51,190
It's

822
00:38:51,190 --> 00:38:54,570
legal first and second trimester 
abortions are legal.

823
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:57,120
And I think that you have to look at all
this is the thing,

824
00:38:57,121 --> 00:38:57,954
when you're writing laws,
we have to think about not just the 

825
00:39:01,441 --> 00:39:02,274
obvious cases but the abberant cases.
This is why writing legislation is 

826
00:39:06,931 --> 00:39:08,320
actually a very,
you know,

827
00:39:08,340 --> 00:39:09,173
it's a nuanced and artistic endeavor and
especially within when you look at how 

828
00:39:12,811 --> 00:39:14,610
you defend laws in the courts,
right?

829
00:39:14,611 --> 00:39:15,444
When you look at case law,
it's complicated because we have to 

830
00:39:17,521 --> 00:39:19,860
fully understand all of the times when 
the,

831
00:39:19,980 --> 00:39:24,630
when the laws can be misused or 
misinterpreted and there are cases,

832
00:39:24,631 --> 00:39:25,464
for example,
where a woman does not know that she is 

833
00:39:27,121 --> 00:39:27,954
pregnant until well into her pregnancy 
and I think you do have to take that 

834
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:32,033
into consideration.
There are cases in which women are 

835
00:39:34,801 --> 00:39:39,630
victims of coercion or abuse or 
sometimes it is more nuanced than that.

836
00:39:39,810 --> 00:39:41,880
Maybe they feel pressure from their 
husband,

837
00:39:41,910 --> 00:39:42,743
their boyfriend or a member of society 
to have a baby and they don't realize 

838
00:39:47,341 --> 00:39:49,350
until later that they do have these 
options.

839
00:39:49,500 --> 00:39:52,080
Maybe they fall on financially difficult
times.

840
00:39:52,200 --> 00:39:54,550
Maybe they find out that there's a,
you know,

841
00:39:54,570 --> 00:39:55,403
some sort of genetic abnormality and the
baby and that they don't have the means 

842
00:39:58,171 --> 00:39:59,004
to raise that baby.
And I think that all of those really 

843
00:40:01,081 --> 00:40:04,380
complicated,
really emotional personal questions have

844
00:40:04,381 --> 00:40:08,880
to be taken into account.
I want to say,

845
00:40:08,910 --> 00:40:09,743
and it may be,
it's easy for me to say because I don't 

846
00:40:11,071 --> 00:40:11,904
have kids,
but the woman is the vessel and she is 

847
00:40:15,811 --> 00:40:19,680
carrying this child and until the child 
comes out of her,

848
00:40:19,890 --> 00:40:20,723
it is her body is her choice and they 
are her rights and I do think that it's 

849
00:40:24,481 --> 00:40:25,314
a complicated topic and I think that 
that's why it's important that we do 

850
00:40:28,051 --> 00:40:28,890
talk about it

851
00:40:28,910 --> 00:40:29,743
and I,
I almost regret having said the part 

852
00:40:32,901 --> 00:40:36,710
about the one week before birth because 
I know it is a straw man and it does.

853
00:40:36,780 --> 00:40:37,613
It's not something that happens,
but I think there's something 

854
00:40:38,841 --> 00:40:42,560
interesting about the when is it really 
a feasible life thing that and obviously

855
00:40:42,561 --> 00:40:43,394
we can't resolve that

856
00:40:43,540 --> 00:40:44,373
and I think that we have to think about 
every possible option because even 

857
00:40:47,111 --> 00:40:49,270
religious people you'll,
you'll find that.

858
00:40:49,271 --> 00:40:52,720
Whereas they would be appalled if they 
got knocked out and had an abortion.

859
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:53,793
They might go get ivf,
which some religions don't even allow 

860
00:40:55,511 --> 00:40:56,344
that,
but they might get ivf and of course 

861
00:40:57,101 --> 00:41:00,520
they're going to do selective reduction 
during ivf.

862
00:41:00,550 --> 00:41:02,440
Is that not abortion in the interview?
I mean,

863
00:41:02,441 --> 00:41:04,470
it's very complicated because,
you know,

864
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:05,313
sometimes you do ivf and like five of 
them stick and then you turn into john 

865
00:41:08,921 --> 00:41:09,754
and kate plus eight.
So I guess the most extreme religious 

866
00:41:12,161 --> 00:41:14,250
people even in those cases,
look at,

867
00:41:14,260 --> 00:41:16,000
look at a babY as a blessing from god.

868
00:41:16,060 --> 00:41:18,670
It's almost like people pick and choose 
when to believe in religion.

869
00:41:19,590 --> 00:41:20,423
So,
uh,

870
00:41:20,740 --> 00:41:22,290
one more for you.
Um,

871
00:41:22,390 --> 00:41:23,223
what I want to do with all these 
interviews is sort of end on a very 

872
00:41:24,791 --> 00:41:27,580
personal note and we actually started on
a personal note because you talked about

873
00:41:27,970 --> 00:41:31,240
leaving the church and very personal 
things related to atheism.

874
00:41:32,650 --> 00:41:33,483
So you have talked about your,
a battle or struggle with depression 

875
00:41:38,150 --> 00:41:39,320
pretty,
pretty vocally.

876
00:41:39,560 --> 00:41:40,400
Um,
but I,

877
00:41:40,401 --> 00:41:42,470
I know you pretty well over the last 
three years.

878
00:41:42,471 --> 00:41:47,010
It's not something that we talk about a 
lot privately and yeah,

879
00:41:47,670 --> 00:41:48,503
it's not actually well in that way.
I know you to be totally like happy and 

880
00:41:54,111 --> 00:41:57,740
well adjusted.
Whatever you struggle with depression.

881
00:41:57,741 --> 00:41:58,100
Yeah.

882
00:41:58,100 --> 00:42:00,560
Really good actors.
They are,

883
00:42:00,561 --> 00:42:02,140
it's a coping mechanism that they 
develop.

884
00:42:02,290 --> 00:42:03,123
And that's not to say that like every 
day of my life I'm pretending to be 

885
00:42:06,251 --> 00:42:10,420
happy because I experience joy and I 
experience happiness on a regular basis.

886
00:42:10,660 --> 00:42:13,600
I'm also in treatment and I take 
medication every day.

887
00:42:13,660 --> 00:42:17,560
And that has made a huge difference.
there have been periods of my life where

888
00:42:17,770 --> 00:42:18,603
if you had seen me,
which I would not have allowed you to 

889
00:42:20,051 --> 00:42:21,910
see me because I was very private,
you know,

890
00:42:22,150 --> 00:42:22,983
again,
we come up with our strategies and we 

891
00:42:23,831 --> 00:42:24,664
come up with our coping mechanisms.
If we had been in a position where you 

892
00:42:28,361 --> 00:42:31,210
had seen me at my lowest of lows,
um,

893
00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:33,070
yeah,
you wouldn't be saying the same thing.

894
00:42:33,071 --> 00:42:33,904
And so I think that that's a common 
experience for people who struggle with 

895
00:42:37,181 --> 00:42:38,014
depression.
There's a private side of your 

896
00:42:39,131 --> 00:42:42,310
depression and then there's a public 
face if you're willing to have one,

897
00:42:42,311 --> 00:42:43,690
which not many people are.

898
00:42:43,690 --> 00:42:46,100
And I completely understand that.
Um,

899
00:42:46,570 --> 00:42:50,440
I personally feel like I have a 
responsibility as somebody who has a bit

900
00:42:50,441 --> 00:42:51,070
of,
um,

901
00:42:51,070 --> 00:42:53,080
you know,
people tweet me,

902
00:42:53,560 --> 00:42:54,221
facebook,
me,

903
00:42:54,221 --> 00:42:55,054
they,
they,

904
00:42:55,060 --> 00:42:57,950
you know,
some people know that I exist and I,

905
00:42:58,040 --> 00:43:00,280
and I've noticed that when I do talk 
about this,

906
00:43:00,550 --> 00:43:03,940
the feedback that I get is really,
um,

907
00:43:04,480 --> 00:43:05,313
it just makes me feel good.
It makes me feel good to know how many 

908
00:43:07,781 --> 00:43:08,614
people are out there who are struggling 
with this and don't see that a lot of 

909
00:43:12,221 --> 00:43:15,040
people are talking about it publicly.
So because of that,

910
00:43:15,041 --> 00:43:17,020
I feel a real obligation to do it.

911
00:43:17,470 --> 00:43:19,830
Is it depressing?
I guess that's an odd choice.

912
00:43:19,930 --> 00:43:21,040
Depression.
Depressing.

913
00:43:22,210 --> 00:43:25,090
Is it depressing to you?
Or disconcerting,

914
00:43:25,091 --> 00:43:25,924
I suppose would be a better word that we
don't really have a mental health 

915
00:43:28,571 --> 00:43:29,404
discussion in this country anymore.
I feel like maybe five years ago we 

916
00:43:31,511 --> 00:43:32,344
actually did a little bit.
People talked about a little bit and 

917
00:43:35,261 --> 00:43:36,094
now,
and I think it was around when the 

918
00:43:36,851 --> 00:43:40,930
shooting started really,
but I don't think we do anymore with the

919
00:43:40,931 --> 00:43:41,764
shootings were not,
were not immediately go into the gun 

920
00:43:43,660 --> 00:43:45,910
thing and that's obviously we need to 
have that discussion,

921
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:47,140
but I worry that the mental health,

922
00:43:47,140 --> 00:43:52,140
the thing is like escape goat for the 
gun advocates so you have the gun nutter

923
00:43:52,271 --> 00:43:54,820
butters and are like,
but it's not because of gone,

924
00:43:54,850 --> 00:43:57,430
it's because he was mentally ill and he 
shouldn't have gotten.

925
00:43:57,460 --> 00:44:00,640
I'm not saying that that's not also a 
very important conversation to have,

926
00:44:00,850 --> 00:44:03,760
but just like we should be having 
conversations about gun control

927
00:44:04,030 --> 00:44:06,070
when we're not in crisis.
You know,

928
00:44:06,071 --> 00:44:06,904
the same thing.
Like when you're having like sexual 

929
00:44:07,781 --> 00:44:08,614
problems at home,
probably not a good idea to talk about 

930
00:44:10,841 --> 00:44:11,674
them when you're both like naked and 
like it's better to wait until it's a 

931
00:44:15,551 --> 00:44:17,070
more calm situation.
He said,

932
00:44:17,100 --> 00:44:17,651
oh,
okay.

933
00:44:17,651 --> 00:44:18,484
Sorry I didn't run.
Wasn't really into it or I couldn't get 

934
00:44:19,901 --> 00:44:22,710
it up or whatever it was going on that 
it's a safe

935
00:44:22,960 --> 00:44:23,793
time to talk about it.
I think it's the same thing when it 

936
00:44:25,091 --> 00:44:28,390
comes to both gun control and mental 
health,

937
00:44:28,391 --> 00:44:29,224
like we should be talking about this in 
the light and in the dark because it's 

938
00:44:33,361 --> 00:44:34,194
not really that helpful when we're doing
it only in crisis and I think it also 

939
00:44:37,680 --> 00:44:41,880
elevates and ignores the day to day 
struggles that people have.

940
00:44:42,210 --> 00:44:44,760
You know,
depression is a massive illness and it's

941
00:44:44,761 --> 00:44:45,594
a biological illness and it's an illness
that destroys lives and it is so 

942
00:44:51,420 --> 00:44:53,730
treatable.
The problem is that,

943
00:44:54,420 --> 00:44:56,400
you know,
in this country especially,

944
00:44:56,401 --> 00:44:57,234
I think with the older set,
we are getting better just like with 

945
00:44:59,040 --> 00:44:59,873
coming out as atheist.
We aren't getting better with the 

946
00:45:01,171 --> 00:45:02,004
younger people.
Erasing that stigma and being more 

947
00:45:03,991 --> 00:45:04,824
comfortable talking about it.
The problem is we still treat 

948
00:45:08,370 --> 00:45:11,940
psychiatric illnesses like,
like disorders of will,

949
00:45:12,510 --> 00:45:15,030
and that's,
that's a fundamental hurdle that we have

950
00:45:15,031 --> 00:45:17,640
to get past that somehow you can will 
yourself out of it.

951
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:20,700
That somehow you can change your 
patterns of thInking.

952
00:45:20,970 --> 00:45:24,330
Just think more positively.
Just do that and you'll be.

953
00:45:24,331 --> 00:45:27,750
Well,
it's because people don't understand the

954
00:45:27,751 --> 00:45:32,751
biological basis of these issues and 
we've never treated depression.

955
00:45:32,971 --> 00:45:33,804
For example,
the same way that we've treated 

956
00:45:34,681 --> 00:45:35,514
diabetes,
you would never shame somebody into 

957
00:45:37,381 --> 00:45:38,760
needing insulin.
Right?

958
00:45:38,761 --> 00:45:39,594
But we do.
We shame people who take 

959
00:45:40,951 --> 00:45:41,784
antidepressants.
We shame people who have to take 

960
00:45:43,591 --> 00:45:48,591
psychiatric medication and that's just a
huge bummer and I hate to see young kids

961
00:45:49,020 --> 00:45:53,190
either being scared away for it or 
feeling like they're not allowed,

962
00:45:53,191 --> 00:45:54,330
are scared away from it.
I'm sorry.

963
00:45:54,331 --> 00:45:55,164
Or feeling like they're not allowed to 
be honest with themselves and older 

964
00:45:59,641 --> 00:46:00,930
people too.
my father,

965
00:46:01,140 --> 00:46:04,560
my father went through a depressive 
episode and my father has struggled with

966
00:46:04,561 --> 00:46:05,394
some things and I remember when he 
finally told me when I was struggling 

967
00:46:07,441 --> 00:46:10,080
myself,
it was so meaningful for me.

968
00:46:10,081 --> 00:46:11,930
It helped me so much.
Oh,

969
00:46:12,140 --> 00:46:13,710
oh.
So much has explained.

970
00:46:13,711 --> 00:46:16,770
And then he became this confidant and I 
could talk to them about it,

971
00:46:16,980 --> 00:46:17,813
but I had no idea what he was going 
through it because he lives a 

972
00:46:19,570 --> 00:46:20,430
generation.

973
00:46:20,760 --> 00:46:23,910
It's like a self fulfilling prophecy.
Almost the shame then just continues the

974
00:46:23,911 --> 00:46:24,744
cycle.
Meanwhile you hear it from your father 

975
00:46:25,861 --> 00:46:28,050
and that it probably makes you feel 
better in,

976
00:46:28,051 --> 00:46:28,670
in who you are.

977
00:46:28,670 --> 00:46:29,181
Well,
and the thing,

978
00:46:29,181 --> 00:46:30,770
I mean,
what you just said is so important.

979
00:46:30,771 --> 00:46:33,620
There's this negative feedback when 
you're depressed,

980
00:46:33,680 --> 00:46:37,100
like actually physically experiencing a 
depressive episode,

981
00:46:37,430 --> 00:46:38,263
such a big portion of that is guilt and 
shame and to have an added layer of 

982
00:46:42,711 --> 00:46:43,544
guilt and shame that comes from society,
not understanding your depression and 

983
00:46:48,111 --> 00:46:51,770
then having to carry the guilt of being 
depressed while you're depressed.

984
00:46:52,820 --> 00:46:54,800
It's insane.
It's impossible.

985
00:46:54,950 --> 00:46:55,783
And so I think the more that we become 
open about it and the more that we 

986
00:46:59,150 --> 00:46:59,983
celebrate all of our differences and our
quirks and the more that we understand 

987
00:47:03,111 --> 00:47:03,944
that going to therapy,
it's like something that a lot more 

988
00:47:06,471 --> 00:47:09,350
people should probably do.
And um,

989
00:47:09,440 --> 00:47:10,273
and,
and being okay with that and being okay 

990
00:47:11,511 --> 00:47:13,640
with the fact that we all have our 
issues,

991
00:47:13,700 --> 00:47:16,460
you know what I mean?
And we all struggle and I think it makes

992
00:47:16,461 --> 00:47:19,610
us richer and it makes us more 
interesting and it makes us more human.

993
00:47:19,940 --> 00:47:20,900
Um,
I don't know.

994
00:47:20,901 --> 00:47:22,190
That's the world I want to live in.

995
00:47:22,330 --> 00:47:23,500
Yeah.
That's the world that want to live.

996
00:47:23,501 --> 00:47:25,150
And I think we did a little talk therapy
here,

997
00:47:25,151 --> 00:47:25,984
right?
How do you feel now?

998
00:47:26,240 --> 00:47:26,480
It's

999
00:47:26,480 --> 00:47:29,930
definitely not the same.
Might shrink.

1000
00:47:30,370 --> 00:47:32,650
Shrink would probably.
I'm not like to hear that.

1001
00:47:32,651 --> 00:47:35,330
This is a therapy session.
Well,

1002
00:47:35,360 --> 00:47:38,810
a camera or a worst part.
I'll tell you what.

1003
00:47:38,890 --> 00:47:40,640
That was a hell of an outro.
Alright.

1004
00:47:40,690 --> 00:47:41,980
Well cara,
of course.

1005
00:47:41,981 --> 00:47:43,390
He's one of my favorite people.
You can follow her.

1006
00:47:43,391 --> 00:47:45,850
It's carrie santa maria.com
at caris.

1007
00:47:45,860 --> 00:47:48,130
Santa maria on twitter.
Do you want to send them anywhere else?

1008
00:47:48,460 --> 00:47:49,510
That's good.
That's good.

1009
00:47:49,530 --> 00:47:50,363
All right.
Thanks for watching everybody and we'll 

1010
00:47:51,671 --> 00:47:52,504
do it again next week.
