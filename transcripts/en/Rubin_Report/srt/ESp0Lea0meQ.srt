1
00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:05,933
It's president's week here on the Rubin 
report working with learn liberty to 

2
00:00:08,731 --> 00:00:09,564
bring you five shows in five days on 
five different presidents of the United 

3
00:00:13,470 --> 00:00:14,303
States.
And joining me today is professor of 

4
00:00:15,781 --> 00:00:16,614
history and economics at San Jose State 
University and author of the book 

5
00:00:20,341 --> 00:00:23,530
emancipating the slaves and slaving free
men,

6
00:00:23,700 --> 00:00:26,670
a history of the American civil war,
Jeffrey Rogers.

7
00:00:26,671 --> 00:00:28,230
Humble.
Welcome to the Rubin report.

8
00:00:28,570 --> 00:00:30,270
It's a pleasure to be on the Rubin 
report.

9
00:00:30,450 --> 00:00:32,820
We have already just in the few minutes 
we've been sitting here,

10
00:00:32,821 --> 00:00:35,280
we talked about almost every other 
prison right now.

11
00:00:35,281 --> 00:00:36,900
I guess we're going to have to get to 
this Lincoln guy.

12
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:38,070
Yes,
definitely.

13
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:39,420
Let's do it.
So first off,

14
00:00:39,421 --> 00:00:41,970
the obvious question,
was he actually a vampire hunter?

15
00:00:43,460 --> 00:00:44,520
Uh,
I doubt it.

16
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:48,780
It's not a show that I watched was a 
movie.

17
00:00:48,781 --> 00:00:52,110
I forgot it was a movie.
I thought it was a documentary,

18
00:00:52,111 --> 00:00:53,780
but apparently not.

19
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:56,070
All right.
There's a lot I want to talk to you now.

20
00:00:56,071 --> 00:01:00,000
It was obvious when we were selecting 
our five presidents to do this week,

21
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:03,060
we wanted to do some of some of the big 
ones and some smaller ones.

22
00:01:03,061 --> 00:01:05,730
And hopefully we'll do this for many 
years to come and get to everybody.

23
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:07,290
But Lincoln was the one I was like,
all right,

24
00:01:07,291 --> 00:01:11,370
we got to do it because I think if you 
polled most Americans,

25
00:01:11,371 --> 00:01:13,560
they always say that Lincoln is their 
favorite.

26
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:16,080
I think probably George Washington comes
in second,

27
00:01:16,081 --> 00:01:18,150
but I think Lincoln is the big one.
Um,

28
00:01:18,151 --> 00:01:18,984
so I want to do a little bit on his bio 
then I want to do obviously on the 

29
00:01:21,601 --> 00:01:24,840
political stuff and civil war and 
freeing the slaves.

30
00:01:24,841 --> 00:01:25,674
And I want to talk about some of the 
interesting criticisms that you have of 

31
00:01:28,410 --> 00:01:29,630
him in this book.
Uh,

32
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:32,010
but first let's just start a little bit 
about

33
00:01:32,300 --> 00:01:35,020
childhood.
Where should we start a.

34
00:01:35,030 --> 00:01:36,770
well,
Lincoln was born in Kentucky,

35
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:38,360
a 18.
Oh,

36
00:01:38,361 --> 00:01:40,400
nine.
Um,

37
00:01:40,460 --> 00:01:45,460
and grew up in a,
in a very poor frontier household.

38
00:01:47,300 --> 00:01:51,020
Uh,
his mother died when he was very young.

39
00:01:51,690 --> 00:01:53,180
It was partly raised by,
uh,

40
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:58,200
by a stepmother.
They moved to Indiana and basically,

41
00:01:58,590 --> 00:02:01,130
um,
he educated himself,

42
00:02:01,770 --> 00:02:04,040
uh,
and um,

43
00:02:04,610 --> 00:02:07,260
and it was a humble background as he 
would have,

44
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:09,380
as he,
as he described it himself.

45
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:12,620
How is that possible to educate himself?
Back then,

46
00:02:12,650 --> 00:02:13,483
I mean,
it was he just grabbing books where he 

47
00:02:14,331 --> 00:02:15,080
was just grabbing

48
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:19,340
books and reading them at every 
opportunity he could get.

49
00:02:19,460 --> 00:02:21,500
Um,
uh,

50
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:24,380
and um,
uh,

51
00:02:24,770 --> 00:02:25,370
yeah,

52
00:02:25,370 --> 00:02:26,203
basically that's basically the story.
Do we know anything about his further 

53
00:02:28,941 --> 00:02:30,920
education as he got a little bit older?

54
00:02:31,110 --> 00:02:31,943
Uh,
I don't know anything about his further 

55
00:02:36,210 --> 00:02:38,820
education and I don't think he was 
university educated.

56
00:02:38,850 --> 00:02:39,683
Um,
he obviously went on to get a law 

57
00:02:40,951 --> 00:02:42,180
degree,
but in those days,

58
00:02:42,181 --> 00:02:46,260
getting a law degree was you clerked 
under a lawyer and then,

59
00:02:46,650 --> 00:02:48,600
um,
you hung out your shingle,

60
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:49,560
right?
Uh,

61
00:02:50,580 --> 00:02:51,870
uh,
so,

62
00:02:52,250 --> 00:02:55,680
uh,
as far as formal education is concerned,

63
00:02:56,090 --> 00:02:57,900
uh,
he didn't have very much of that.

64
00:02:58,050 --> 00:03:00,160
Yeah.
Was his real ambition at first

65
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:03,000
to be a lawyer?
Uh,

66
00:03:04,690 --> 00:03:07,600
I don't know whether he had a real 
ambition at first.

67
00:03:07,601 --> 00:03:08,170
I mean,
you know,

68
00:03:08,170 --> 00:03:08,770
he,
he,

69
00:03:08,770 --> 00:03:09,603
he,
he had a lot of other kinds of more 

70
00:03:11,981 --> 00:03:15,070
frontier oriented jobs.
Right.

71
00:03:15,130 --> 00:03:17,290
That's how he got the nickname,
the rail splitter.

72
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:21,760
I'm working on the rivers,
uh,

73
00:03:21,761 --> 00:03:24,490
and uh,
and those sorts of things.

74
00:03:25,030 --> 00:03:26,480
And so,
um,

75
00:03:27,430 --> 00:03:31,790
I think he just sort of fell into a law.
Yeah.

76
00:03:32,380 --> 00:03:35,710
So he's alone,
but eventually,

77
00:03:35,711 --> 00:03:38,740
I mean,
eventually politics became his passion.

78
00:03:39,260 --> 00:03:40,093
Yeah.
So he's a lawyer and then politics 

79
00:03:41,361 --> 00:03:42,370
became his passion.
Yeah.

80
00:03:42,410 --> 00:03:43,080
I would say

81
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:45,330
two are interrelated because remember at
that time,

82
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:47,290
uh,
um,

83
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:50,610
many of your politicians,
if not most of your politicians,

84
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:51,913
uh,
we're either came through the military 

85
00:03:53,611 --> 00:03:55,920
or through the profession of law.

86
00:03:56,060 --> 00:03:56,893
Yeah.
Was there a seminal moment for him that 

87
00:03:58,161 --> 00:04:02,180
he realized this is when and why I have 
to get into politics?

88
00:04:03,550 --> 00:04:04,383
Uh,

89
00:04:04,900 --> 00:04:06,190
no,
I don't think so.

90
00:04:06,340 --> 00:04:07,530
I don't think so,
uh,

91
00:04:07,540 --> 00:04:08,373
you know,
it's like a life happens and 

92
00:04:12,671 --> 00:04:15,040
opportunities open and you take 
advantage of them.

93
00:04:15,100 --> 00:04:16,420
Yeah.
Um,

94
00:04:17,020 --> 00:04:18,400
and uh,
you know,

95
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:19,071
he,
he,

96
00:04:19,071 --> 00:04:22,690
I had a legal profession,
uh,

97
00:04:22,691 --> 00:04:26,800
in Illinois and then he was elected to 
the Illinois legislature,

98
00:04:27,220 --> 00:04:28,053
uh,
eventually elected to the House of 

99
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:32,620
Representatives,
uh,

100
00:04:32,710 --> 00:04:36,630
for a short time,
uh,

101
00:04:36,670 --> 00:04:39,820
and um,
and became very prominent,

102
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:42,100
uh,
in the Illinois Whig Party.

103
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:43,033
Yeah.
What were his politics like in time and 

104
00:04:44,361 --> 00:04:45,630
what was the whig party like?
Okay,

105
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:46,730
well this is one of the places,

106
00:04:47,470 --> 00:04:48,171
if,
if you,

107
00:04:48,171 --> 00:04:49,700
um,
look at the two parties,

108
00:04:49,701 --> 00:04:50,534
ideologically at that time it was the 
whigs versus the Democrats and the wigs 

109
00:04:55,870 --> 00:04:58,160
or the intervention intervention is 
party.

110
00:04:58,240 --> 00:04:59,073
Uh,
the wigs were in favor of high 

111
00:05:01,761 --> 00:05:02,594
protective tariffs.
They were in favor of spending a lot of 

112
00:05:07,671 --> 00:05:08,504
money,
government money on internal 

113
00:05:09,470 --> 00:05:11,810
improvements,
what we call infrastructure today,

114
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:13,153
uh,
and they were in favor of a nationally 

115
00:05:15,530 --> 00:05:16,363
chartered bank and a lot of these 
policies were the outgrowth of one of 

116
00:05:23,271 --> 00:05:24,104
the most prominent wig leaders,
Henry Clay and what he termed as 

117
00:05:26,691 --> 00:05:30,650
American system.
Whereas by this time,

118
00:05:30,651 --> 00:05:35,270
the Democratic Party had become the 
party of a laissez faire,

119
00:05:35,410 --> 00:05:36,243
a low tariffs,
getting rid of the national bank and in 

120
00:05:39,681 --> 00:05:40,514
fact actually trying to divorce 
government from any relationship with 

121
00:05:45,441 --> 00:05:46,880
banks,
um,

122
00:05:47,990 --> 00:05:48,823
and at least trying to keep the federal 
government out of funding internal 

123
00:05:52,881 --> 00:05:53,480
improvement.

124
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:54,180
Yeah.
That,

125
00:05:54,180 --> 00:05:56,390
that's very interesting to me because in
a modern sense,

126
00:05:56,391 --> 00:06:00,170
that seems to be bit of a reversal on 
where we're at right now.

127
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:03,110
Was,
was Lincoln really in line with.

128
00:06:03,570 --> 00:06:04,770
Oh yeah.
I mean,

129
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:07,100
he really admired Henry Clay.
Henry Clay,

130
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:10,210
what was his hero?
Uh,

131
00:06:10,290 --> 00:06:11,880
and he,
uh,

132
00:06:11,881 --> 00:06:15,740
he supported all of those policies down 
the line when he was in,

133
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:19,440
uh,
the state legislature in Illinois.

134
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:20,633
He was crucial and passing a very 
expensive internal improvements program 

135
00:06:26,641 --> 00:06:31,641
in Illinois that subsequently almost 
drove the state into bankruptcy,

136
00:06:32,150 --> 00:06:35,550
a financing of canals and railroads.

137
00:06:36,940 --> 00:06:41,940
So fiscally at the time he was,
he was spending a lot and did the,

138
00:06:42,020 --> 00:06:44,530
the infrastructure deal actually makes 
sense.

139
00:06:45,100 --> 00:06:46,420
Uh,
well,

140
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:48,890
I'm uh,
no,

141
00:06:49,630 --> 00:06:51,730
in other words,
in other words,

142
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:55,960
if,
if what happened is that the states went

143
00:06:55,961 --> 00:06:58,690
through sort of two phases in terms of 
infrastructure.

144
00:06:59,050 --> 00:07:04,050
The first phase was canal building and 
the second phase was railroads.

145
00:07:04,580 --> 00:07:07,960
These are often referred to as phases of
the transportation revolution.

146
00:07:07,961 --> 00:07:09,680
During that period,
uh,

147
00:07:09,700 --> 00:07:14,700
the canal building or GE was actually 
set off by a New York building,

148
00:07:15,701 --> 00:07:16,534
the Erie Canal,
which is one of the few examples of a 

149
00:07:18,701 --> 00:07:21,280
socialist enterprise that actually made 
a profit.

150
00:07:21,790 --> 00:07:25,300
And so this inspired a lot of other 
states to build canals,

151
00:07:25,301 --> 00:07:26,134
almost all of which lost money and 
created financial problems for the 

152
00:07:30,971 --> 00:07:32,060
states that,
uh,

153
00:07:32,450 --> 00:07:33,200
uh,
uh,

154
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:34,033
built them,
which is suggest that they were not 

155
00:07:37,481 --> 00:07:39,830
economically justified.
Uh,

156
00:07:39,850 --> 00:07:44,380
and then as a result of the state's 
losing so much money on the canals,

157
00:07:44,950 --> 00:07:45,783
um,
initially they were heavily involved in 

158
00:07:48,821 --> 00:07:51,430
railroads and they continue to subsidize
the railroads,

159
00:07:51,431 --> 00:07:52,880
but at least,
uh,

160
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:56,080
by the 18,
40 [inaudible] and 18 fifties,

161
00:07:56,081 --> 00:07:56,914
they weren't owning outright the 
railroads the way they had owned 

162
00:07:59,951 --> 00:08:01,950
outright the canals.
And therefore,

163
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:03,420
um,
uh,

164
00:08:03,670 --> 00:08:04,870
even the,
the,

165
00:08:05,050 --> 00:08:07,390
the,
there was a little bit too much railroad

166
00:08:07,391 --> 00:08:10,600
expansion,
a subsidized by the government,

167
00:08:10,601 --> 00:08:14,590
but it wasn't as significant as the 
problems created by the canal building.

168
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:16,770
Interesting.
Because this is a part of Lincoln that I

169
00:08:16,771 --> 00:08:17,190
don't,
you know,

170
00:08:17,190 --> 00:08:20,010
we mostly think about the civil war and 
freeing the slaves,

171
00:08:20,250 --> 00:08:22,020
but the economic party sort of 
interesting.

172
00:08:22,110 --> 00:08:22,943
What do you think has sort of overriding
economic policy was because it sounds 

173
00:08:25,531 --> 00:08:26,364
like it was,
it was.

174
00:08:26,660 --> 00:08:27,493
Well,
he carried this policy into the 

175
00:08:28,491 --> 00:08:30,770
presidency.
The first,

176
00:08:31,070 --> 00:08:31,903
a subsidized transcontinental railroads 
were during Lincoln's administration 

177
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:36,673
during the civil war,
and that resulted in many other trans 

178
00:08:40,050 --> 00:08:45,050
continentals and being subsidized by the
national government and a whole bunch of

179
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:50,450
a pork barrel legislation and in the 
post civil war period,

180
00:08:50,451 --> 00:08:55,451
and a lot of scandals,
corruption involved as well.

181
00:08:56,310 --> 00:08:57,270
So,
um,

182
00:08:58,170 --> 00:08:59,640
uh,
so,

183
00:08:59,641 --> 00:09:04,620
so his economic views continued 
throughout his entire career.

184
00:09:04,950 --> 00:09:05,783
And these were,
this was the main dividing line between 

185
00:09:07,561 --> 00:09:10,740
the two policies to the,
between the two political parties,

186
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:14,340
uh,
because up until the civil war,

187
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:15,593
uh,
both political parties tied to straddle 

188
00:09:17,431 --> 00:09:20,700
the issue of slavery,
so they would both be national parties.

189
00:09:21,220 --> 00:09:22,053
Um,
so they tried to keep it out as best 

190
00:09:24,010 --> 00:09:29,010
they could out of the political arena.
When did he start talking about slavery?

191
00:09:30,541 --> 00:09:30,991
Really?
I mean,

192
00:09:30,991 --> 00:09:33,480
when he was in the Illinois legislature.

193
00:09:33,590 --> 00:09:34,423
No,
he doesn't really start talking about 

194
00:09:35,461 --> 00:09:36,930
slavery.
Um,

195
00:09:37,450 --> 00:09:38,520
he,
uh,

196
00:09:38,580 --> 00:09:41,940
he,
he had a visceral dislike of slavery,

197
00:09:42,310 --> 00:09:43,980
uh,
from his youth,

198
00:09:44,340 --> 00:09:47,670
but he didn't really start talking about
slavery until,

199
00:09:48,170 --> 00:09:52,230
um,
after the Kansas Nebraska Act.

200
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:57,560
And slavery becomes a,
a prominent issue and it causes a,

201
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:01,610
the death of the whig party,
um,

202
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:04,020
and the collapse of the,
uh,

203
00:10:04,050 --> 00:10:06,300
of the wake park.
Can you explain that a little bit more?

204
00:10:06,301 --> 00:10:07,650
Why,
why that actually?

205
00:10:07,820 --> 00:10:08,830
Yeah.
Well,

206
00:10:09,090 --> 00:10:14,090
see both parties initially try to 
straddle the slavery issue,

207
00:10:15,030 --> 00:10:18,510
but as,
as it evolves over time,

208
00:10:19,050 --> 00:10:19,883
um,
the whig party being more 

209
00:10:21,391 --> 00:10:24,090
interventionists tends to be stronger in
New England.

210
00:10:24,950 --> 00:10:25,783
I'm a,
whereas the Democratic Party tending to 

211
00:10:29,671 --> 00:10:30,504
be non intervention is,
tends to be stronger in the south and 

212
00:10:32,641 --> 00:10:34,860
the West.
And so,

213
00:10:35,310 --> 00:10:39,330
uh,
the both parties feel the strain between

214
00:10:39,331 --> 00:10:42,180
northern and southern Democrats,
northern and southern wigs,

215
00:10:42,181 --> 00:10:47,181
but the whig party is actually blown 
apart by that strain after,

216
00:10:48,420 --> 00:10:50,190
uh,
the Kansas Nebraska Act.

217
00:10:50,220 --> 00:10:55,220
And one issue that causes the demise of 
the whig party a is slavery.

218
00:10:56,250 --> 00:10:59,610
So you have the split between northern 
whigs in southern wigs.

219
00:11:00,190 --> 00:11:01,023
Um,
and then also another issue that comes 

220
00:11:05,101 --> 00:11:08,310
to the fore during that period is 
immigration.

221
00:11:08,690 --> 00:11:10,380
Um,
uh,

222
00:11:10,381 --> 00:11:13,350
there is a,
a nativist movement,

223
00:11:13,730 --> 00:11:15,060
uh,
that,

224
00:11:15,061 --> 00:11:16,380
uh,
um,

225
00:11:16,410 --> 00:11:17,310
uh,
some,

226
00:11:17,460 --> 00:11:18,840
uh,
wigs,

227
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:20,370
uh,
end up embracing.

228
00:11:20,371 --> 00:11:22,780
And that also is a,
plays a role in the,

229
00:11:22,830 --> 00:11:26,230
in the demise of the whig party.
What was his policy on?

230
00:11:26,750 --> 00:11:27,583
Well,
actually Lincoln was fairly good on 

231
00:11:28,801 --> 00:11:29,250
that.
I mean,

232
00:11:29,250 --> 00:11:30,660
he was,
in other words,

233
00:11:30,990 --> 00:11:34,680
there was a debate within the councils 
of the Republican Party about,

234
00:11:35,070 --> 00:11:35,761
um,
you know,

235
00:11:35,761 --> 00:11:37,900
between those who were more nativist and
who,

236
00:11:37,950 --> 00:11:41,520
those who are less nativist and Lincoln 
was definitely on the side of the one he

237
00:11:41,521 --> 00:11:42,354
didn't want.
He didn't want the Republican Party to 

238
00:11:44,581 --> 00:11:47,670
be able to take a,
a platform stand on,

239
00:11:47,730 --> 00:11:50,200
on nativism opposing,
uh,

240
00:11:50,570 --> 00:11:53,670
uh,
immigration or actually they,

241
00:11:53,671 --> 00:11:54,504
they,
they weren't proposing restrictions on 

242
00:11:56,591 --> 00:12:00,910
immigration so much as restrictions on 
acquiring citizenship.

243
00:12:01,390 --> 00:12:02,223
So when the whig party fell apart and 
then basically the remnants became the 

244
00:12:06,130 --> 00:12:06,560
Republican Party.
What,

245
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:07,840
what,
what was that like,

246
00:12:07,841 --> 00:12:09,580
what,
like where did they literally just.

247
00:12:09,870 --> 00:12:11,550
Well,
actually the people are,

248
00:12:11,820 --> 00:12:12,653
well initially,
initially the Republican Party as a 

249
00:12:15,101 --> 00:12:19,720
coalition of antislavery wigs and 
antislavery Democrats.

250
00:12:19,810 --> 00:12:21,110
So it,
um,

251
00:12:21,190 --> 00:12:25,960
it's exclusively a sectional party.
It's almost exclusively.

252
00:12:26,050 --> 00:12:27,790
So,
just to be really clear on that though.

253
00:12:27,791 --> 00:12:31,270
So the Republican Party actually was the
original antislavery party.

254
00:12:31,271 --> 00:12:34,540
It was taking from both sides,
and we're taking,

255
00:12:34,780 --> 00:12:37,930
now we need to be clear about this term 
antislavery,

256
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:40,210
um,
uh,

257
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:43,100
because being antislavery was,
was a,

258
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:44,073
a broad tent.
I'm at one extreme where the 

259
00:12:47,291 --> 00:12:48,880
abolitionists,
um,

260
00:12:49,020 --> 00:12:49,853
and at least in America,
the term abolitionists refers to a 

261
00:12:54,610 --> 00:12:55,443
antislavery,
a advocates who favor immediate 

262
00:12:59,081 --> 00:12:59,914
emancipation of all slaves and full 
political rights for all African 

263
00:13:07,030 --> 00:13:08,050
Americans.
So,

264
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:12,430
um,
there's a whole range of antislavery,

265
00:13:12,490 --> 00:13:13,660
uh,
positions.

266
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:16,270
And so the Republican Party,
uh,

267
00:13:16,271 --> 00:13:20,620
the abolitionists are always a minority 
and the Republican Party,

268
00:13:20,710 --> 00:13:25,710
I'm succeeds where the abolitionists 
don't succeed by reducing antislavery to

269
00:13:28,241 --> 00:13:29,074
its lowest common denominator,
essentially one issue which is opposing 

270
00:13:33,251 --> 00:13:35,320
the spread of slavery into the 
territories.

271
00:13:36,010 --> 00:13:39,670
And so you have a,
and again,

272
00:13:39,671 --> 00:13:42,470
the Kansas Nebraska Act,
uh,

273
00:13:42,550 --> 00:13:44,290
in which,
uh,

274
00:13:44,291 --> 00:13:45,280
in which,
uh,

275
00:13:45,310 --> 00:13:49,270
Kansas and Nebraska were opened to 
slavery,

276
00:13:49,740 --> 00:13:50,573
uh,
in violation of the Missouri compromise 

277
00:13:53,861 --> 00:13:58,861
is what sort of inspires this,
a concern among antislavery northerners.

278
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:02,410
So just to,
just to be clear,

279
00:14:02,411 --> 00:14:07,411
at the beginning of the civil war,
there are a lot of Democrats involved in

280
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:09,940
former Democrats involved in the 
Republican Party.

281
00:14:10,330 --> 00:14:14,080
Lincoln's secretary of State Solomon 
chases a former Democrat,

282
00:14:14,490 --> 00:14:17,020
um,
several Republican governors,

283
00:14:17,300 --> 00:14:19,400
uh,
and send it,

284
00:14:19,790 --> 00:14:20,820
pardon me,
yet,

285
00:14:20,830 --> 00:14:24,510
Republican senators and governors are 
former Republican.

286
00:14:24,570 --> 00:14:25,403
So in Lincoln's election,
that Republican party has to sort of 

287
00:14:30,791 --> 00:14:35,791
straddle these economic issues to keep 
both sides of the coalition Together.

288
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:41,170
Where did he fall when,
when he was running for president,

289
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:44,620
where did he fall on that scale of 
abolitionists?

290
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:46,960
To what,
what would you call you?

291
00:14:46,961 --> 00:14:48,370
Call that other group.
They were sort of,

292
00:14:48,371 --> 00:14:49,131
well,
they're just a,

293
00:14:49,131 --> 00:14:51,800
they're just anti slavery and,
um,

294
00:14:51,940 --> 00:14:53,570
but what,
what that approach that they had,

295
00:14:53,571 --> 00:14:54,310
what would you refer to?

296
00:14:54,310 --> 00:14:57,150
Is that pragmatic or what did they base?
It was a.

297
00:14:57,170 --> 00:14:58,970
well,
gradualist pragmatic.

298
00:14:59,210 --> 00:15:00,470
Basically,
again,

299
00:15:00,471 --> 00:15:02,510
this is where Lincoln follows Henry 
Clay.

300
00:15:03,230 --> 00:15:04,063
Henry clay was a favorite.
W W was in favor of colonization in 

301
00:15:11,841 --> 00:15:13,410
other words,
uh,

302
00:15:13,550 --> 00:15:14,790
not just,
uh,

303
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:15,673
having a,
a plan of perhaps compensated 

304
00:15:17,811 --> 00:15:19,220
emancipation,
um,

305
00:15:19,221 --> 00:15:21,390
in which freed slaves,
um,

306
00:15:21,620 --> 00:15:23,490
are,
uh,

307
00:15:23,540 --> 00:15:24,373
move to back to Africa.
And Lincoln was a big advocate of 

308
00:15:29,331 --> 00:15:30,620
colonization.
And in fact,

309
00:15:30,621 --> 00:15:34,580
he continues to pursue colonization.
Um,

310
00:15:34,730 --> 00:15:38,000
even after the outbreak of the civil 
war.

311
00:15:38,430 --> 00:15:40,280
Um,
by the end of the civil war,

312
00:15:40,281 --> 00:15:44,240
he's probably given up on that,
but during the civil war,

313
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:45,330
uh,
he,

314
00:15:45,690 --> 00:15:47,240
uh,
sponsored one,

315
00:15:47,660 --> 00:15:52,370
a disastrous attempt at colonization in 
Haiti,

316
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:53,630
uh,
that,

317
00:15:53,631 --> 00:15:55,430
um,
it just didn't work.

318
00:15:55,660 --> 00:15:56,750
What happened?
Well,

319
00:15:56,780 --> 00:15:58,580
what happened is that they,
they,

320
00:15:58,620 --> 00:16:00,920
they got the,
um,

321
00:16:01,070 --> 00:16:03,260
I'm a little bit hazy on the details 
but,

322
00:16:03,620 --> 00:16:06,950
but um,
some land was acquired in Haiti and they

323
00:16:06,951 --> 00:16:07,784
got some African Americans who agreed to
move there and then it was not just 

324
00:16:12,201 --> 00:16:14,870
economically unviable,
but,

325
00:16:14,940 --> 00:16:17,870
uh,
does had problems with disease.

326
00:16:17,870 --> 00:16:21,170
And so the whole colony collapse.
In other words,

327
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:24,110
he wanted to do it.
He was,

328
00:16:24,140 --> 00:16:29,140
he wanted to push it in Latin America,
something similar to Liberia.

329
00:16:32,090 --> 00:16:35,240
I'm in,
I'm in Africa,

330
00:16:35,241 --> 00:16:36,074
which also was also a colonization,
skiing a set up by the American 

331
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:45,470
Colonization Society of which Henry Clay
was a participant.

332
00:16:45,590 --> 00:16:46,423
Right.
So there's a couple of interesting 

333
00:16:47,451 --> 00:16:48,284
things there.
So you referenced that the Whig Party 

334
00:16:49,131 --> 00:16:49,964
itself had a sort of internal conflict 
between their northern representatives 

335
00:16:53,731 --> 00:16:56,300
and that would be someone like Abraham 
Lincoln had their southern.

336
00:16:56,660 --> 00:17:00,740
If you are a local representative in the
legislature in Illinois,

337
00:17:01,220 --> 00:17:03,440
did it ever come up to talk about,
I mean,

338
00:17:03,441 --> 00:17:04,274
why would slavery even really,
it was only within the national 

339
00:17:06,531 --> 00:17:07,131
discussion,
right?

340
00:17:07,131 --> 00:17:07,964
Like was it something that people were 
actually voting on in any way or not at 

341
00:17:10,731 --> 00:17:11,570
the state level?
No,

342
00:17:11,970 --> 00:17:13,460
I'm.
Th,

343
00:17:13,870 --> 00:17:14,703
they're hard to think of party politics 
into 2018 lens without everything being 

344
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:21,470
a national and everybody affected by 
every little thing.

345
00:17:21,470 --> 00:17:22,251
Yeah,
yeah.

346
00:17:22,251 --> 00:17:23,084
No,
the only sense in which it was it the 

347
00:17:25,911 --> 00:17:26,744
only sense in which the state you got 
involved at the state level was with 

348
00:17:30,201 --> 00:17:31,034
respect to the fugitive slave law.
So if you look at the history of 

349
00:17:33,861 --> 00:17:36,530
slavery,
there's always this tension between free

350
00:17:36,531 --> 00:17:38,590
states and slave states,
um,

351
00:17:38,990 --> 00:17:42,080
even at the constitutional convention,
uh,

352
00:17:42,110 --> 00:17:43,420
but it,
um,

353
00:17:43,820 --> 00:17:48,820
is usually kept below the surface except
during,

354
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:50,340
uh,
these,

355
00:17:50,580 --> 00:17:52,980
uh,
instances where it,

356
00:17:53,010 --> 00:17:53,843
where it erupts and then it's resolved.
So you first have a Missouri coming in 

357
00:17:58,561 --> 00:17:59,394
as a slave state,
which leads to the Missouri compromise 

358
00:18:01,321 --> 00:18:02,620
and then,
uh,

359
00:18:02,700 --> 00:18:06,630
things calmed down and then you have the
tariff issue,

360
00:18:06,631 --> 00:18:10,590
which is partially driven by South 
Carolina slave.

361
00:18:10,820 --> 00:18:11,653
Um,
and then you have a things calming down 

362
00:18:14,971 --> 00:18:19,971
with the annexation of Texas and 
California coming in as a state.

363
00:18:20,130 --> 00:18:23,210
Slavery becomes a big issue again.
Um,

364
00:18:23,340 --> 00:18:26,610
and it's partially,
um,

365
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:27,680
uh,
I'm,

366
00:18:27,950 --> 00:18:32,950
I'm calmed down by the compromise of 
1850 and then after that you'll have the

367
00:18:35,010 --> 00:18:35,250
Kansas Nebraska act.

368
00:18:35,250 --> 00:18:37,080
And then,
uh,

369
00:18:37,081 --> 00:18:37,914
then there's no calming it down anymore.
And the compromise of 1850 is 

370
00:18:42,541 --> 00:18:44,820
responsible.
Part of the,

371
00:18:44,910 --> 00:18:45,743
part of what southerners got out of the 
compromise of 1850 or more precisely 

372
00:18:49,021 --> 00:18:53,490
slaveholders was the slave,
was the fugitive slave act of 1850.

373
00:18:54,120 --> 00:18:58,230
I'm now one of the,
one of the constitutional deals,

374
00:18:58,380 --> 00:18:59,820
I mean,
right in the constitution,

375
00:18:59,821 --> 00:19:03,090
there's a fugitive slave provision in 
which,

376
00:19:03,370 --> 00:19:04,203
um,
it's the obligation of free states to 

377
00:19:06,871 --> 00:19:07,704
return runaway slaves.
And The Washington administration 

378
00:19:10,501 --> 00:19:12,840
actually passed the first fugitive slave
act.

379
00:19:12,841 --> 00:19:13,674
But the fugitive slave act of 1850 was 
one of the most draconian laws that 

380
00:19:18,751 --> 00:19:21,480
Congress ever enacted.
And,

381
00:19:21,540 --> 00:19:23,100
um,
uh,

382
00:19:23,101 --> 00:19:25,510
in other words,
it set up a,

383
00:19:25,511 --> 00:19:28,620
a bureaucracy of commissioners who would
hear,

384
00:19:28,830 --> 00:19:30,020
um,
uh,

385
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:34,770
cases of fugitive slaves.
They got $5 if they decided that,

386
00:19:34,860 --> 00:19:35,940
uh,
that the,

387
00:19:35,941 --> 00:19:39,150
uh,
a person wasn't a slave and $10,

388
00:19:39,151 --> 00:19:42,830
if they decided it was a sleigh,
uh,

389
00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:43,920
they,
um,

390
00:19:44,220 --> 00:19:48,650
the slave had no right to represent j 
station.

391
00:19:48,690 --> 00:19:51,300
I'm a jury trial.
No right to testify.

392
00:19:51,301 --> 00:19:53,660
The legislature and,
uh,

393
00:19:53,670 --> 00:19:55,090
the uh,
uh,

394
00:19:55,100 --> 00:19:57,210
the commissioners could,
um,

395
00:19:57,400 --> 00:19:59,300
uh,
um,

396
00:19:59,590 --> 00:20:03,390
uh,
require the cooperation of individuals,

397
00:20:03,750 --> 00:20:05,250
um,
uh,

398
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:06,233
to apprehend runaways.
And if you violated a that you could 

399
00:20:11,521 --> 00:20:15,330
face a jail sentence,
$1,000

400
00:20:15,331 --> 00:20:17,550
fine,
a $1,000

401
00:20:17,551 --> 00:20:20,670
civil penalties for each escaped slave.
So it was pretty.

402
00:20:20,850 --> 00:20:25,440
So many of your northern states began 
before this,

403
00:20:25,441 --> 00:20:29,280
but began after this passing what were 
called personal liberty laws.

404
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:30,793
I'm trying to make sure that state 
officials did not participate in the 

405
00:20:36,961 --> 00:20:40,280
apprehension and return of runaways.
And so that's,

406
00:20:40,360 --> 00:20:41,250
that's,
that's the,

407
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:44,250
that's the big slavery issue in northern
states.

408
00:20:44,280 --> 00:20:45,113
Yeah.
It sounds like such a crazy thing 

409
00:20:45,961 --> 00:20:49,630
because they were incentivizing the 
northern states that may not have wanted

410
00:20:49,631 --> 00:20:50,464
to send the slaves back.
They were literally financially 

411
00:20:53,261 --> 00:20:54,700
incentivizing and then as you were 
saying,

412
00:20:54,940 --> 00:20:58,090
there were other people,
there were just citizens that were going

413
00:20:58,091 --> 00:20:58,924
out there,
but also also also made it easier to 

414
00:21:01,871 --> 00:21:03,130
engage in kidnapping.

415
00:21:03,220 --> 00:21:05,560
I'm free blacks.
Yeah,

416
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:09,040
bringing them south.
Who was fighting this the most?

417
00:21:09,041 --> 00:21:09,874
I mean,
I would imagine there must've been some 

418
00:21:10,331 --> 00:21:13,390
states rights people in the north that 
maybe you didn't even care about slavery

419
00:21:13,391 --> 00:21:14,224
per se,
but must've said you can't tell what 

420
00:21:16,180 --> 00:21:17,013
this is.
This is one of the things after the 

421
00:21:18,821 --> 00:21:23,821
compromise of 1850 that brings slavery,
starts pushing it to the forefront.

422
00:21:25,030 --> 00:21:28,450
And of course this is when a heli,
Elliot,

423
00:21:29,730 --> 00:21:32,710
a uncle Tom's cabin,
um,

424
00:21:32,711 --> 00:21:34,390
Henry beat.
What's her first name?

425
00:21:34,990 --> 00:21:35,823
I'm drawing a blank up.
It'll pop up and say I'm a Harriet 

426
00:21:42,100 --> 00:21:44,110
Beecher stowe rights uncle.
Tom's cabin,

427
00:21:44,140 --> 00:21:47,850
which becomes a best seller and it's 
about the fugitive slave issues.

428
00:21:48,280 --> 00:21:53,280
So it sensitizes a lot of northerners to
the fugitive slave a question.

429
00:21:55,180 --> 00:21:56,013
And so a Illinois doesn't pass it a 
personal liberty law because southern 

430
00:22:00,431 --> 00:22:05,431
Illinois is actually settled by,
um,

431
00:22:06,150 --> 00:22:07,420
uh,
from the southern,

432
00:22:07,490 --> 00:22:10,300
uh,
the eastern southern states,

433
00:22:10,650 --> 00:22:11,483
uh,
but some of your other states like 

434
00:22:13,661 --> 00:22:15,460
Pennsylvania,
uh,

435
00:22:15,461 --> 00:22:16,294
and states further north do pass 
personal liberty laws as a result of 

436
00:22:22,270 --> 00:22:25,720
either before the fugitive slave act or 
after the fugitive slave act.

437
00:22:25,870 --> 00:22:28,390
So before we get directly into the 
presidency and the war,

438
00:22:28,391 --> 00:22:29,224
is there anything else we need to know 
about Lincoln's politics at the time or 

439
00:22:31,751 --> 00:22:32,584
what else was influencing him besides 
obviously there were states' rights 

440
00:22:35,411 --> 00:22:38,410
issues,
there was obviously the slavery issue.

441
00:22:38,610 --> 00:22:39,041
Uh,
it,

442
00:22:39,041 --> 00:22:39,874
was there anything else that we think of
as really the moments that kind of 

443
00:22:42,611 --> 00:22:44,480
shaped him before the president?
I think,

444
00:22:44,481 --> 00:22:45,314
I think we've,
I think we've covered the important 

445
00:22:46,601 --> 00:22:47,500
issue.
Those are the big ones.

446
00:22:47,501 --> 00:22:49,360
Okay.
So he runs for president.

447
00:22:49,790 --> 00:22:51,760
What do we need to know about that 
platform?

448
00:22:52,870 --> 00:22:53,710
Well,
as I say,

449
00:22:53,711 --> 00:22:58,120
it tries to paper over the difference 
between former Democrats informer wigs.

450
00:22:58,580 --> 00:23:02,530
It has a,
it has a plank about,

451
00:23:03,040 --> 00:23:04,950
um,
uh,

452
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:07,660
about the tariff,
uh,

453
00:23:07,661 --> 00:23:09,800
that,
uh,

454
00:23:09,970 --> 00:23:13,490
can be interpreted differently.
Uh,

455
00:23:13,810 --> 00:23:18,300
but the primary,
a plank is a,

456
00:23:18,310 --> 00:23:22,240
his opposition to the spread of slavery 
into any more territories.

457
00:23:22,930 --> 00:23:25,530
Uh,
and uh,

458
00:23:26,530 --> 00:23:27,363
what's interesting about that plank is 
that it's essentially that plank has 

459
00:23:34,241 --> 00:23:38,980
essentially been declared 
unconstitutional by the Supreme Court in

460
00:23:38,981 --> 00:23:42,070
the dred Scott decision in the dred 
Scott decision.

461
00:23:42,071 --> 00:23:45,910
The Supreme Court says that I'm,
uh,

462
00:23:46,710 --> 00:23:47,700
has,
uh,

463
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:52,840
the territories are the common property 
of both nor northerners and southerners,

464
00:23:53,390 --> 00:23:54,223
and therefore the national government 
cannot restrict the property rights of 

465
00:23:58,071 --> 00:23:58,904
southerners when they move into the 
territories by preventing them from 

466
00:24:02,211 --> 00:24:05,130
bringing their slaves.
So that,

467
00:24:05,210 --> 00:24:08,500
so you have,
you have a platform plank that was,

468
00:24:08,530 --> 00:24:12,620
that was literally unconstitutional,
a declared unconstitutional.

469
00:24:12,621 --> 00:24:14,150
I mean,
most Supreme Court,

470
00:24:14,450 --> 00:24:15,283
uh,
most,

471
00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:16,790
most,
uh,

472
00:24:16,940 --> 00:24:19,640
legal scholars today think it was a very
bad decision,

473
00:24:19,641 --> 00:24:20,560
but yes,
it was,

474
00:24:20,630 --> 00:24:21,463
had been declared unconstitutional.
What do we need to know about the tenor 

475
00:24:25,280 --> 00:24:28,100
of the political infighting at that 
time?

476
00:24:28,101 --> 00:24:28,761
You know,
these days,

477
00:24:28,761 --> 00:24:30,830
everyone always says,
never has never been worse.

478
00:24:30,831 --> 00:24:33,680
Everyone's meaner than ever before.
And you know,

479
00:24:33,710 --> 00:24:35,630
trump's tweeting this and all that.
But,

480
00:24:35,631 --> 00:24:38,020
uh,
there were some pretty serious fighting.

481
00:24:38,021 --> 00:24:38,270
Okay?

482
00:24:38,270 --> 00:24:42,460
And those kinds of claims or are 
exaggerated,

483
00:24:42,461 --> 00:24:43,660
I mean,
you,

484
00:24:43,740 --> 00:24:48,740
you can find a campaign rhetoric and 
campaign literature that,

485
00:24:50,771 --> 00:24:51,604
uh,
if not vicious version of verges on 

486
00:24:53,261 --> 00:24:58,261
being vicious throughout this,
the period leading up to the civil war.

487
00:24:58,301 --> 00:25:00,810
I wouldn't say that the civil war,
uh,

488
00:25:00,811 --> 00:25:05,811
are the 1860 election is particularly 
unique in that respect.

489
00:25:06,780 --> 00:25:07,613
Um,
but what happens is that you end up 

490
00:25:09,281 --> 00:25:10,114
having a four candidates,
a Lincoln as the candidate of the 

491
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:17,890
Republican Party,
um,

492
00:25:17,980 --> 00:25:18,813
and then the Democratic Party splits.
So you have Stephen Douglas as the 

493
00:25:23,111 --> 00:25:23,944
candidate of the northern Democrats.
I'm John Breckinridge is the candidate 

494
00:25:28,421 --> 00:25:29,870
of the southern,
uh,

495
00:25:30,340 --> 00:25:33,400
Democrats.
And then some of your,

496
00:25:33,460 --> 00:25:34,930
um,
uh,

497
00:25:34,990 --> 00:25:38,800
upper tiers,
former southern wigs,

498
00:25:39,160 --> 00:25:42,580
um,
form a constitutional union party.

499
00:25:43,480 --> 00:25:44,313
So to oversimplify only a little,
it becomes really to elections and 

500
00:25:50,470 --> 00:25:51,303
election between Lincoln and Douglas in 
the north and in an election between 

501
00:25:53,981 --> 00:25:57,610
Breckenridge and John Bell and the 
Constitutional Union Party in the south.

502
00:25:57,710 --> 00:26:01,850
Yeah.
So the next obvious segue is the Lincoln

503
00:26:01,850 --> 00:26:02,390
Douglas Debates,
right?

504
00:26:02,390 --> 00:26:02,871
That's.
No,

505
00:26:02,871 --> 00:26:04,730
that's before the 18,
60 election.

506
00:26:05,540 --> 00:26:07,080
It was for that election though.
No,

507
00:26:07,100 --> 00:26:07,670
no,
no,

508
00:26:07,670 --> 00:26:08,570
no.
This is,

509
00:26:09,320 --> 00:26:10,153
remember this,

510
00:26:10,450 --> 00:26:12,280
I'm,
when I'm,

511
00:26:12,310 --> 00:26:15,010
senators are still chosen by the state 
legislature.

512
00:26:15,990 --> 00:26:18,460
Uh,
so that's one of the things that makes a

513
00:26:18,461 --> 00:26:23,461
debate unique because it's the 1858 
Senate election in Illinois.

514
00:26:25,570 --> 00:26:30,570
The legislature is going to choose who 
is going to be the senator,

515
00:26:30,970 --> 00:26:33,640
but the Republican candidate is,
is Lincoln,

516
00:26:33,641 --> 00:26:34,474
the Democratic candidate is douglas and 
then they go around and have these 

517
00:26:40,451 --> 00:26:42,060
debates,
um,

518
00:26:42,490 --> 00:26:47,450
at various throughout Illinois.
That's funny.

519
00:26:47,451 --> 00:26:48,284
I mean,
I like to think that I know a lot about 

520
00:26:49,191 --> 00:26:50,270
this stuff.
I had no idea that,

521
00:26:50,271 --> 00:26:51,104
that wasn't on the national scale 
because they did run against each other 

522
00:26:53,511 --> 00:26:55,160
just two years later,
two years later.

523
00:26:55,170 --> 00:26:56,003
So this actually propels Lincoln into 
the forefront of potential candidates 

524
00:27:02,250 --> 00:27:03,083
for the Republican nomination in 1860,
even though the legislature chooses 

525
00:27:07,651 --> 00:27:08,484
douglass as an Illinois senator.
So when I want you to explain what the 

526
00:27:15,210 --> 00:27:17,520
Lincoln Douglas debates are and why 
there's such a richness there,

527
00:27:17,521 --> 00:27:21,500
but was nothing like this even done 
before that when we,

528
00:27:21,570 --> 00:27:25,170
everyone talks about it like it was so 
revolutionary or we so desperately could

529
00:27:25,171 --> 00:27:26,070
use it these days.

530
00:27:26,070 --> 00:27:26,903
I wouldn't,
I wouldn't go so far as say it nothing 

531
00:27:28,291 --> 00:27:33,291
like it,
but in terms of how extensive it was and

532
00:27:35,970 --> 00:27:39,570
the draw,
it was unprecedented.

533
00:27:40,190 --> 00:27:41,023
Uh,
can you explain the basic tenants of 

534
00:27:42,660 --> 00:27:44,570
sort of how it would work?
Um,

535
00:27:44,600 --> 00:27:45,433
well,
basically they picked out various 

536
00:27:47,091 --> 00:27:47,924
locations in Illinois,
I forget the number of debates and they 

537
00:27:51,141 --> 00:27:53,560
would travel there and then they would,
um,

538
00:27:54,010 --> 00:27:59,010
a face off each other and the big issue 
with slavery and Lincoln,

539
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:00,913
his position was prohibiting slavery.
The extension of slavery into the 

540
00:28:03,660 --> 00:28:08,000
territory's Douglass,
his position he was trying,

541
00:28:08,210 --> 00:28:11,300
he was,
the Democratic Party hadn't split,

542
00:28:12,230 --> 00:28:17,230
so he was trying to maintain the unity 
of the Democratic Party.

543
00:28:19,221 --> 00:28:20,540
So,
uh,

544
00:28:21,060 --> 00:28:26,060
his position is known as popular 
sovereignty and his view was that,

545
00:28:27,110 --> 00:28:28,370
um,
uh,

546
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:29,233
we leave the territory's open and then 
let people in the territory's decide 

547
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:39,640
whether it's going to be a slave 
territory or a free territory,

548
00:28:41,690 --> 00:28:42,523
but that creates a certain amount of 
ambiguity because when did I get to 

549
00:28:46,341 --> 00:28:47,174
decide?

550
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:51,110
Do they only get to the side?
I'm a,

551
00:28:51,111 --> 00:28:56,111
at the time of statehood,
I'm also a,

552
00:28:57,160 --> 00:29:00,350
uh,
if they decide before statehood,

553
00:29:00,590 --> 00:29:03,500
aren't they violating the dred Scott 
Decision?

554
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:06,320
So,
so that was,

555
00:29:06,500 --> 00:29:08,960
but there was also a racial element to 
the debates.

556
00:29:09,380 --> 00:29:12,490
Um,
because you brought,

557
00:29:12,560 --> 00:29:15,500
you brought up the issue of viciousness 
in the campaigns.

558
00:29:15,850 --> 00:29:16,683
I'm,
the attempt is to paint Lincoln as an 

559
00:29:21,111 --> 00:29:22,820
advocate of,
um,

560
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:27,740
racial amalgamation because even in the 
north,

561
00:29:28,140 --> 00:29:28,973
uh,
despite the northern states being free 

562
00:29:30,981 --> 00:29:32,840
states,
um,

563
00:29:32,930 --> 00:29:37,760
in most of the northern states,
African Americans face legal disability,

564
00:29:38,210 --> 00:29:39,710
um,
uh,

565
00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:43,510
and uh,
and significant social discrimination.

566
00:29:44,110 --> 00:29:44,943
So,
so,

567
00:29:45,190 --> 00:29:49,630
so at this time a Lincoln would make the
distinction between,

568
00:29:49,650 --> 00:29:53,050
um,
between a civil equality,

569
00:29:53,320 --> 00:29:54,153
political equality and social equality 
and civil equality is being means being 

570
00:30:00,191 --> 00:30:01,390
equal.
Before the law,

571
00:30:01,780 --> 00:30:02,613
political equality would involve giving 
African Americans the right to vote and 

572
00:30:06,971 --> 00:30:08,920
then we know it.
Social equality is about.

573
00:30:08,921 --> 00:30:09,754
So his position at this time,
he did not advocate political equality 

574
00:30:15,280 --> 00:30:18,600
was not in favor of giving 
African-americans.

575
00:30:18,650 --> 00:30:19,180
Right.
So,

576
00:30:19,180 --> 00:30:24,180
but he was firmly in favor of civil 
equality and that's where he and Douglas

577
00:30:25,210 --> 00:30:26,560
Different.
What was that

578
00:30:27,390 --> 00:30:28,223
part?
Totally pragmatic in that he felt if he 

579
00:30:30,961 --> 00:30:31,501
said,
well,

580
00:30:31,501 --> 00:30:32,334
I am,

581
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:34,750
it might have been programmatic,
but remember he,

582
00:30:34,751 --> 00:30:35,390
he's,
uh,

583
00:30:35,390 --> 00:30:38,950
as I said he was,
he was in favor of colonization,

584
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:40,450
[inaudible],
uh,

585
00:30:40,630 --> 00:30:44,890
even if he,
even when he began to entertain views of

586
00:30:44,950 --> 00:30:49,480
political equality for pragmatic 
reasons,

587
00:30:49,481 --> 00:30:52,750
not politically,
but for pragmatic reasons.

588
00:30:52,751 --> 00:30:55,460
He wasn't sure if the country was ready.
Um,

589
00:30:56,050 --> 00:30:59,800
in other words,
he would use arguments which I think are

590
00:30:59,801 --> 00:31:01,120
sincere,
that,

591
00:31:01,150 --> 00:31:02,050
that,
um,

592
00:31:02,550 --> 00:31:03,383
that,
that,

593
00:31:03,430 --> 00:31:05,090
you know,
uh,

594
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:05,953
that the two races are not going to be 
comfortable living together and that it 

595
00:31:08,201 --> 00:31:13,201
would be better off for African 
Americans once free to,

596
00:31:13,450 --> 00:31:15,010
uh,
move elsewhere.

597
00:31:15,030 --> 00:31:15,670
Yeah.
Now he,

598
00:31:15,670 --> 00:31:16,503
eventually,
he eventually dropped that and 

599
00:31:18,011 --> 00:31:23,011
eventually by the end of his life was a 
favoring a limited franchise for a freed

600
00:31:25,241 --> 00:31:29,470
African Americans in Louisiana.
So his ideas are changing.

601
00:31:29,471 --> 00:31:30,310
They're progressing.
Yeah.

602
00:31:30,710 --> 00:31:31,543
Yeah.
That's what's interesting is that there 

603
00:31:32,111 --> 00:31:32,944
is an evolution here,
which really we find out really in the 

604
00:31:34,931 --> 00:31:37,540
presidency.
Did the abolitionists basically hate him

605
00:31:37,541 --> 00:31:38,291
at that point?
I mean,

606
00:31:38,291 --> 00:31:42,610
did they think he was sort of a sellout 
or that he just because he was doing the

607
00:31:42,611 --> 00:31:43,900
pragmatic thing?
Yes,

608
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:47,270
abolitionists did.
Some abolitionists did ever.

609
00:31:47,660 --> 00:31:49,230
Uh,
and um,

610
00:31:49,860 --> 00:31:51,330
uh,
uh,

611
00:31:51,570 --> 00:31:52,403
so there was still,
there had been before the creation of 

612
00:31:55,441 --> 00:31:56,274
the Republican party,
there had been the liberty party in the 

613
00:31:57,991 --> 00:31:58,824
free soil party,
which were slightly broader antislavery 

614
00:32:01,351 --> 00:32:02,184
coalitions,
but minor minor parties and there still 

615
00:32:05,311 --> 00:32:08,550
was a radical abolitionist party that 
ran in 1860,

616
00:32:08,551 --> 00:32:10,650
but it garnered very,
very,

617
00:32:10,700 --> 00:32:12,750
a few votes

618
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:13,970
[inaudible].
Okay.

619
00:32:13,971 --> 00:32:16,700
So we started touching them,
the beginnings of the election.

620
00:32:16,701 --> 00:32:18,630
So basically for candidates running,
right,

621
00:32:18,710 --> 00:32:20,810
because of the split in the Democratic 
Party.

622
00:32:20,811 --> 00:32:23,330
What else do we have to know before he 
gets elected that,

623
00:32:23,331 --> 00:32:23,810
that happened?

624
00:32:23,810 --> 00:32:25,160
That's pretty much it.
I mean,

625
00:32:25,161 --> 00:32:25,994
he didn't win the popular vote,
but even if you combine the vote of all 

626
00:32:29,571 --> 00:32:30,404
the other candidates,
he still would have won the electoral 

627
00:32:32,181 --> 00:32:33,150
college.
Right.

628
00:32:33,300 --> 00:32:34,133
Interesting.
So what was the beginning of his 

629
00:32:35,371 --> 00:32:36,570
presidency?
Right?

630
00:32:36,740 --> 00:32:37,700
Uh,
well,

631
00:32:37,701 --> 00:32:38,534
um,
the beginning of his is a dominated by 

632
00:32:44,060 --> 00:32:47,390
the,
a succession of the deep south.

633
00:32:47,990 --> 00:32:51,190
So soon after he was inaugurated,
um,

634
00:32:51,290 --> 00:32:54,370
well after he's elected,
um,

635
00:32:54,440 --> 00:32:58,520
the deep south secedes with South 
Carolina being the first state,

636
00:32:59,060 --> 00:33:04,060
and then you have the cotton states,
I'm succeeding was even inaugurated now.

637
00:33:05,260 --> 00:33:06,093
No,
that was right after the election is 

638
00:33:07,450 --> 00:33:11,270
incredible by the way.
One interesting detail that,

639
00:33:11,300 --> 00:33:13,870
um,
a lot of people are unaware of and South

640
00:33:13,870 --> 00:33:17,300
Carolina's ordinance of succession and 
they're the first state.

641
00:33:17,301 --> 00:33:20,220
They're the,
they're the most firebrand of all the,

642
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:22,910
a secessionist,
um,

643
00:33:23,630 --> 00:33:25,880
uh,
in their ordinance of secession.

644
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:28,100
Um,
they do not,

645
00:33:28,510 --> 00:33:29,080
uh,
the,

646
00:33:29,080 --> 00:33:29,913
the issue they give the largest play too
in terms of justifying secession is not 

647
00:33:34,611 --> 00:33:35,444
Lincoln's election,
but northern failure to comply with the 

648
00:33:38,391 --> 00:33:41,270
fugitive slave clause of the 
constitution.

649
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:42,673
Now,
partially that's a rhetorical ploy 

650
00:33:44,211 --> 00:33:46,700
because it allows them to argue that the
northerners,

651
00:33:47,070 --> 00:33:47,903
um,
ha ha had divided the constitutional 

652
00:33:50,421 --> 00:33:51,254
contract first,
but it also reflects a deep concern 

653
00:33:54,861 --> 00:33:57,980
about I'm a fugitive slaves.

654
00:33:58,010 --> 00:33:59,900
And,
and one of the,

655
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:00,913
one of the points that I make in my book
is that I think most historians have 

656
00:34:05,241 --> 00:34:07,990
underestimated the economic significance
of the,

657
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:12,560
of the fugitive slave issue in terms of 
bringing on succession.

658
00:34:12,980 --> 00:34:14,740
And maybe we can get to that.
No,

659
00:34:14,780 --> 00:34:16,130
I,
I do want to get to that.

660
00:34:16,131 --> 00:34:17,000
So,
um,

661
00:34:17,030 --> 00:34:17,863
so,
so you have the deep south seceding and 

662
00:34:19,521 --> 00:34:20,354
they're seizing all of the US military 
basis except for a few that are holding 

663
00:34:25,881 --> 00:34:26,714
out and the prominent one that's holding
out his fort sumpter and Charleston 

664
00:34:30,111 --> 00:34:31,640
harbor.
Uh,

665
00:34:31,670 --> 00:34:36,230
so James Buchanan has to deal with this.
He's the lame duck president.

666
00:34:36,920 --> 00:34:41,920
He tries to reinforce a sumpter and a 
South Carolina fires on the ship.

667
00:34:43,911 --> 00:34:44,744
And so,
but the garrison is still there when 

668
00:34:46,581 --> 00:34:48,620
Lincoln,
it becomes president.

669
00:34:49,070 --> 00:34:49,903
So that's the big issue that's 
dominating a Lincoln's presidency is 

670
00:34:53,241 --> 00:34:54,980
what do you,
what do you do about Fort Sumpter?

671
00:34:55,730 --> 00:35:00,730
And I'm a Lincoln.
Um,

672
00:35:01,370 --> 00:35:04,610
you know,
he's getting all kinds of advice.

673
00:35:05,030 --> 00:35:09,410
Uh,
some people want him to try to.

674
00:35:09,880 --> 00:35:14,880
I'm back down on the Republican position
about slavery in the territories,

675
00:35:16,610 --> 00:35:19,130
but he absolutely refuses to do so.
I mean,

676
00:35:19,131 --> 00:35:19,964
he's,
he has agreed to enforce the fugitive 

677
00:35:22,191 --> 00:35:23,024
slave act as president,
so this is the only antislavery issue 

678
00:35:27,550 --> 00:35:30,700
and he decides to hang onto it.
Um,

679
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:32,980
and uh,
someone,

680
00:35:32,990 --> 00:35:35,810
a more aggressive policy,
someone the more passive policy,

681
00:35:35,811 --> 00:35:40,811
basically I'm Lincoln essentially 
follows Buchanan's policy,

682
00:35:42,751 --> 00:35:43,584
although Buchanan gets a lot of 
criticism you that and what happens is 

683
00:35:50,370 --> 00:35:53,430
we'll Buchanan's policy being what being
a,

684
00:35:53,460 --> 00:35:58,460
trying to reinforce the fort but not 
using military force to,

685
00:35:59,010 --> 00:36:00,420
um,
to,

686
00:36:00,510 --> 00:36:02,310
to uh,
um,

687
00:36:02,840 --> 00:36:04,380
hold on to the fort.
Gotcha.

688
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:06,060
All right.
So,

689
00:36:06,090 --> 00:36:06,923
uh,
Lincoln sends 'em reinforcements and 

690
00:36:11,341 --> 00:36:14,160
supplies to the Fort,
uh,

691
00:36:14,590 --> 00:36:16,350
uh,
telling the uh,

692
00:36:16,380 --> 00:36:17,760
South Carolina that he's doing.

693
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:19,640
So by this time the confederacy is 
formed,

694
00:36:19,641 --> 00:36:22,530
the confederacy fires on Fort Sumpter,
right?

695
00:36:23,090 --> 00:36:24,410
And,
and that's the,

696
00:36:24,460 --> 00:36:26,550
that's the nine slash 11 of the civil 
war.

697
00:36:26,730 --> 00:36:27,563
It polarizes both sides of it.
Polarizes northerners because up until 

698
00:36:34,351 --> 00:36:35,184
this time,
there are a lot of northern resou 

699
00:36:36,040 --> 00:36:36,451
saying,
well,

700
00:36:36,451 --> 00:36:38,640
we should let the south going piece.
Many of them think,

701
00:36:38,641 --> 00:36:39,830
well,
if we let them go and piece,

702
00:36:39,870 --> 00:36:41,980
they'll come back.
Um,

703
00:36:42,540 --> 00:36:44,580
and at the time of Lincoln's 
inauguration,

704
00:36:44,581 --> 00:36:47,430
there's still more slave states in the 
union then out of the union.

705
00:36:48,360 --> 00:36:49,193
Um,
but Lincoln responds to the firing on 

706
00:36:52,081 --> 00:36:57,081
Fort Sumpter by calling out troops and 
immediately Virginia,

707
00:36:57,930 --> 00:36:58,763
North Carolina,
Tennessee and Arkansas all joined the 

708
00:37:03,241 --> 00:37:04,450
confederacy.
So it,

709
00:37:04,620 --> 00:37:05,453
it,
it,

710
00:37:06,140 --> 00:37:08,410
it's the great divide.
Um,

711
00:37:09,380 --> 00:37:10,770
with a stroke of the pen,
he's,

712
00:37:10,830 --> 00:37:14,340
he's doubled the size and the material 
resources of the confederacy.

713
00:37:14,490 --> 00:37:15,323
Yeah.
What do we know about his thought 

714
00:37:16,081 --> 00:37:17,070
process at the time?

715
00:37:17,070 --> 00:37:20,940
Well,
he really ready for the fallout that was

716
00:37:20,941 --> 00:37:22,740
gonna happen.
Um,

717
00:37:22,860 --> 00:37:24,450
yes and no.
And then the escalation.

718
00:37:25,820 --> 00:37:26,653
Yes and no.
Let me back up a little and explain why 

719
00:37:29,581 --> 00:37:31,300
he had to do this.
All right,

720
00:37:31,340 --> 00:37:32,173
uh,
why it was politically necessary to do 

721
00:37:33,601 --> 00:37:34,630
this.
Um,

722
00:37:35,010 --> 00:37:39,330
many of your abolitionists,
particularly William Lloyd Garrison,

723
00:37:39,331 --> 00:37:44,331
who is one of my heroes who was 
advocated immediate emancipation,

724
00:37:44,401 --> 00:37:46,860
full political rights for all African 
Americans.

725
00:37:46,861 --> 00:37:51,230
He was also a pacifist.
I'm an anarchist,

726
00:37:51,260 --> 00:37:54,120
a classical liberal and favor of free 
trade,

727
00:37:54,121 --> 00:37:58,830
free labor,
his opposition to slavery.

728
00:37:58,831 --> 00:38:03,831
A lot of the radical abolitionist framed
it as man stealing.

729
00:38:04,360 --> 00:38:04,980
Um,
and,

730
00:38:04,980 --> 00:38:08,010
you know,
in terms of a property rights and he was

731
00:38:08,011 --> 00:38:08,844
also in favor of northern secession from
the union because he saw the 

732
00:38:12,961 --> 00:38:16,470
constitution as a pro slavery document.
Uh,

733
00:38:16,500 --> 00:38:17,650
he,
um,

734
00:38:17,850 --> 00:38:19,290
denounced the,
uh,

735
00:38:19,530 --> 00:38:20,363
constitution.
I'm a publicly burned a copy and on the 

736
00:38:25,771 --> 00:38:26,604
masthead of his,
of his paper that liberate or no union 

737
00:38:29,851 --> 00:38:30,880
with slave holders.

738
00:38:31,110 --> 00:38:33,600
I'm grace throughout,
uh,

739
00:38:33,720 --> 00:38:36,160
from 18,
31 on to the civil war.

740
00:38:36,350 --> 00:38:37,183
And,
and this was true of many of your most 

741
00:38:38,951 --> 00:38:39,784
radical abolitionists.
So basically what you're abolitionists 

742
00:38:45,710 --> 00:38:46,543
and one of the reasons they were so 
unpopular is because they were saying 

743
00:38:49,331 --> 00:38:53,350
you can't have antislavery and union.
Um,

744
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:56,470
uh,
and uh,

745
00:38:56,500 --> 00:38:58,900
people are committed to the union,
right?

746
00:38:58,901 --> 00:39:00,970
So they're not happy about the 
Appalachian.

747
00:39:01,360 --> 00:39:06,360
The Republican Party,
by reducing the antislavery issue to its

748
00:39:06,761 --> 00:39:10,930
lowest common denominator in the 
territory's is telling the public,

749
00:39:10,931 --> 00:39:15,330
you can have a antislavery in union.
Alright,

750
00:39:15,400 --> 00:39:17,560
well,
once the unions threatened,

751
00:39:17,830 --> 00:39:18,663
the Republican Party is going to have to
suppress succession or face political 

752
00:39:23,201 --> 00:39:25,120
oblivion.
And in fact,

753
00:39:26,530 --> 00:39:29,350
even if Stephen Douglas had been elected
president,

754
00:39:30,190 --> 00:39:35,190
he's an old hard line Jacksonian if he 
had been elected president and the south

755
00:39:35,381 --> 00:39:38,170
had still succeeded.
Now that's not very likely,

756
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:40,370
but if he had been elected president and
the staff,

757
00:39:40,430 --> 00:39:41,263
it's succeeded,
he probably would have moved a military 

758
00:39:44,651 --> 00:39:47,020
force against the south even faster than
Lincoln

759
00:39:47,090 --> 00:39:47,923
[inaudible].
It's,

760
00:39:48,080 --> 00:39:48,913
it's so interesting because I think one 
of the themes as we do this whole week 

761
00:39:52,390 --> 00:39:53,223
is looking at these people through 2018 
lens and when you hear that somebody 

762
00:39:57,550 --> 00:39:58,383
didn't want full rights for people but 
wanted to free them or they couldn't 

763
00:40:00,731 --> 00:40:02,890
vote or some of the other issues you're 
talking about.

764
00:40:03,160 --> 00:40:03,993
And yet at the same time you're saying,
but the abolition is actually weren't 

765
00:40:05,681 --> 00:40:07,110
that popular,
right?

766
00:40:07,540 --> 00:40:08,373
It's like to give,
to view these people through our lens 

767
00:40:11,351 --> 00:40:12,730
today is,
is really,

768
00:40:12,790 --> 00:40:13,623
it's a very slippery slope because 
Lincoln had to do some things that 

769
00:40:16,781 --> 00:40:18,420
perhaps,
uh,

770
00:40:19,390 --> 00:40:23,810
in our lens now would have been viewed 
as very unfair to the African American.

771
00:40:24,510 --> 00:40:25,570
And there he was.
So.

772
00:40:25,571 --> 00:40:26,450
Okay.
So the,

773
00:40:26,451 --> 00:40:30,380
the war begins and he said he's a new 
president at war.

774
00:40:30,640 --> 00:40:33,160
A,
who is he getting advice from?

775
00:40:33,190 --> 00:40:35,470
Were like,
did he really understand how to.

776
00:40:35,910 --> 00:40:36,743
Okay.
Well,

777
00:40:36,930 --> 00:40:37,763
the other part of the answer to your 
question is that I'm a Lincoln and many 

778
00:40:44,611 --> 00:40:49,611
of the Republicans in many northerners 
in general underestimated,

779
00:40:50,780 --> 00:40:51,613
um,
the enthusiasm for succession on the 

780
00:40:55,141 --> 00:40:58,440
part of southerners.
They believed,

781
00:40:58,560 --> 00:41:03,560
initially believed that it was a 
southern elite of slaveholders,

782
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:08,910
almost a conspiracy that had brought 
about succession and that,

783
00:41:09,240 --> 00:41:14,240
um,
and that's why they weren't prepared for

784
00:41:15,001 --> 00:41:19,710
the extent of the resistance of a 
southerners.

785
00:41:20,130 --> 00:41:21,810
Uh,
once Lincoln,

786
00:41:22,170 --> 00:41:24,060
uh,
calls out troops.

787
00:41:24,780 --> 00:41:29,760
And so once he calls out troops,
then,

788
00:41:29,790 --> 00:41:31,920
then you have the problem of managing 
the war.

789
00:41:32,570 --> 00:41:34,010
So there was really,
he could have done at

790
00:41:34,010 --> 00:41:36,080
that point,
even if even if there were voices,

791
00:41:36,320 --> 00:41:38,200
even if he internally felt,
well,

792
00:41:38,201 --> 00:41:41,570
maybe we could just let them go,
or if he had voices around him that were

793
00:41:41,571 --> 00:41:42,170
saying,
Oh,

794
00:41:42,170 --> 00:41:43,440
you know,
seed,

795
00:41:44,180 --> 00:41:45,260
it was too late,
really,

796
00:41:45,300 --> 00:41:45,990
right.
Yep.

797
00:41:45,990 --> 00:41:48,000
Politically,
politically.

798
00:41:48,001 --> 00:41:51,630
I mean,
by that time I'm in the north,

799
00:41:51,631 --> 00:41:52,464
at least not in the deep south,
but in the North Liberty in union had 

800
00:41:56,971 --> 00:42:01,080
become mystically identify as 
inseparable.

801
00:42:01,560 --> 00:42:03,480
Uh,
and uh,

802
00:42:03,930 --> 00:42:07,770
and so that's,
um,

803
00:42:07,980 --> 00:42:09,180
and,
and in fact,

804
00:42:09,340 --> 00:42:12,000
right,
this leads to the question of,

805
00:42:12,280 --> 00:42:12,970
uh,
the,

806
00:42:12,970 --> 00:42:15,930
a more basic question of what caused the
civil war.

807
00:42:15,990 --> 00:42:20,990
Right?
And there's now a current trend to argue

808
00:42:21,001 --> 00:42:24,780
that slavery caused the civil war and 
not only that caused the civil war,

809
00:42:24,781 --> 00:42:27,390
but it was all about slavery.
Uh,

810
00:42:27,720 --> 00:42:29,450
and that in fact,
slavery,

811
00:42:29,451 --> 00:42:32,370
um,
the entire history of the union up until

812
00:42:32,550 --> 00:42:34,080
that point is all about slavery.

813
00:42:34,110 --> 00:42:37,070
You disagree with it?
I just get away.

814
00:42:38,580 --> 00:42:42,690
I think that asking what caused the 
civil war is the wrong question.

815
00:42:43,020 --> 00:42:48,020
And even some of your new abolitionists,
historians like Ken Stamp and Eric Foner

816
00:42:49,530 --> 00:42:52,680
have pointed out that they're really two
separate questions.

817
00:42:53,100 --> 00:42:58,020
Why does the sow seed and why does the 
North refused to let the south go?

818
00:42:58,710 --> 00:43:02,460
And the answer to the first question is 
definitely slavery.

819
00:43:02,790 --> 00:43:04,740
I mean,
the evidence is overwhelming for that.

820
00:43:04,770 --> 00:43:05,603
There's probably hardly any historical 
causal explanation at that level of 

821
00:43:10,891 --> 00:43:14,760
abstraction for which the evidence is 
more overwhelming.

822
00:43:14,761 --> 00:43:17,010
So the south secedes in order to protect
slavery.

823
00:43:17,040 --> 00:43:18,030
Okay,
so that's easy,

824
00:43:18,210 --> 00:43:22,110
but I'm ending.
Slavery is not what motivates the north,

825
00:43:22,440 --> 00:43:24,720
what motivates the north is preserving 
the union.

826
00:43:24,780 --> 00:43:26,220
And in fact,
Lincoln,

827
00:43:26,800 --> 00:43:28,120
I'm,
uh,

828
00:43:28,450 --> 00:43:29,283
in the Er before the firing on Fort 
sumpter endorses a original 13th 

829
00:43:35,401 --> 00:43:36,234
amendment which has not passed in which 
he's still holding to the position of 

830
00:43:41,251 --> 00:43:43,500
opposing the extension of slavery in the
territories.

831
00:43:43,500 --> 00:43:47,730
But this new amendment would protect 
slavery in the existing slave states and

832
00:43:47,731 --> 00:43:52,731
be unamendable in the early days of the 
war.

833
00:43:54,090 --> 00:43:54,923
Uh,
some of your union commanders were 

834
00:43:57,151 --> 00:44:00,210
returning runaway slaves.
So,

835
00:44:00,260 --> 00:44:01,500
um,
so the,

836
00:44:01,590 --> 00:44:04,750
so,
so the war from the union perspective,

837
00:44:04,751 --> 00:44:08,070
the suppression of succession is 
designed to preserve the union.

838
00:44:08,460 --> 00:44:09,293
And Lincoln even later says,
if he could preserve the union by 

839
00:44:11,880 --> 00:44:13,530
freeing all the slaves,
he'll do that.

840
00:44:13,531 --> 00:44:16,590
If he could preserve the union by 
framing some none of the slaves,

841
00:44:16,591 --> 00:44:17,424
he'll do that.
If he can preserve the union by freeing 

842
00:44:18,740 --> 00:44:22,260
some and leaving others enslaved,
he would do that.

843
00:44:22,310 --> 00:44:26,360
What was his real belief in the union 
based in did he,

844
00:44:26,390 --> 00:44:31,390
did he just truly believed that we had 
to remain one country otherwise would be

845
00:44:31,800 --> 00:44:32,430
perpetual

846
00:44:32,430 --> 00:44:33,263
war?
Is that.

847
00:44:33,680 --> 00:44:34,513
Yeah.
Yeah.

848
00:44:34,560 --> 00:44:38,850
He thought that the disillusion of the 
union would lead to anarchy.

849
00:44:40,450 --> 00:44:41,283
Yeah.
It's interesting because now one of the 

850
00:44:43,111 --> 00:44:48,111
things that's one of the things that's 
interesting about historians is the,

851
00:44:48,310 --> 00:44:49,143
the,
even historians who don't seem to be 

852
00:44:51,421 --> 00:44:55,110
explicitly nationalist than nationalist 
bias with which they,

853
00:44:55,360 --> 00:44:57,960
um,
approach that issue.

854
00:44:58,440 --> 00:45:00,330
Uh,
so,

855
00:45:00,390 --> 00:45:01,710
uh,
for instance,

856
00:45:03,060 --> 00:45:03,893
the US,
I had made several attempts to an ex 

857
00:45:07,051 --> 00:45:08,660
Canada,
um,

858
00:45:08,910 --> 00:45:10,650
in the early history,
uh,

859
00:45:10,680 --> 00:45:13,530
first during the American revolution,
then during the war of 18,

860
00:45:13,531 --> 00:45:14,490
12,
and then,

861
00:45:14,850 --> 00:45:17,340
uh,
between and after those events,

862
00:45:17,670 --> 00:45:18,503
uh,
by sponsoring the kinds of a 

863
00:45:20,970 --> 00:45:23,240
revolutionary movements that,
uh,

864
00:45:23,280 --> 00:45:25,650
brought Texas into the union.
All right.

865
00:45:25,651 --> 00:45:30,210
If any of those had succeeded 
historians,

866
00:45:30,211 --> 00:45:31,044
would it be writing great historians 
would be writing the history of North 

867
00:45:36,030 --> 00:45:36,863
America as if this was an inevitable in 
any other result would have been 

868
00:45:39,121 --> 00:45:41,620
catastrophic.
Um,

869
00:45:41,790 --> 00:45:46,080
my view is that the north,
uh,

870
00:45:46,081 --> 00:45:49,500
that the North American continent has 
gotten along fine with,

871
00:45:49,501 --> 00:45:51,630
to Anglo American republics.

872
00:45:51,630 --> 00:45:55,050
If it had been three or more history 
would have been different,

873
00:45:55,051 --> 00:45:58,050
but would have been,
it wouldn't have been catastrophic,

874
00:45:58,170 --> 00:46:00,000
different.
And,

875
00:46:00,030 --> 00:46:03,130
and speaking of the example of Canada,
you know,

876
00:46:03,210 --> 00:46:04,043
when Canada was looking at the,
at this session of the peaceful 

877
00:46:06,931 --> 00:46:07,764
succession of Quebec,
its population was about the same size 

878
00:46:11,280 --> 00:46:12,113
as the union at the time and the 
population of Quebec was greater than 

879
00:46:18,780 --> 00:46:19,613
the Gulf coast confederacy that 
initially succeeded and slightly less 

880
00:46:22,981 --> 00:46:26,610
than the confederacy once a Lincoln had 
called out troops.

881
00:46:26,820 --> 00:46:27,653
Did Lincoln have any advisors or anyone 
close to him at the time that was just 

882
00:46:30,661 --> 00:46:31,770
saying,
forget this,

883
00:46:32,400 --> 00:46:33,810
you know,
just let them go.

884
00:46:33,820 --> 00:46:35,010
No,
we're going to do,

885
00:46:35,011 --> 00:46:37,250
we live by our laws here.
So he really,

886
00:46:37,500 --> 00:46:39,000
well,
there were some,

887
00:46:39,060 --> 00:46:39,893
um,
there were some newspaper editors prior 

888
00:46:43,711 --> 00:46:44,544
to Fort Sumpter who were in favor of a 
peaceful succession and letting us out 

889
00:46:51,570 --> 00:46:53,940
south,
at least temporarily go in peace.

890
00:46:54,370 --> 00:46:57,840
Uh,
there was even a secessionist movement,

891
00:46:58,230 --> 00:46:59,790
uh,
in New York City,

892
00:47:01,760 --> 00:47:04,250
but I'm meaning they wanted New York 
City to see.

893
00:47:04,251 --> 00:47:04,980
See?
Yeah.

894
00:47:04,980 --> 00:47:05,813
Yeah.
Even though geographically you've got 

895
00:47:07,690 --> 00:47:09,570
really make any sense.
And uh,

896
00:47:10,140 --> 00:47:12,540
um,
and uh,

897
00:47:12,920 --> 00:47:14,030
uh,
Lincoln's,

898
00:47:14,310 --> 00:47:18,750
um,
I'm a secretary of state,

899
00:47:19,260 --> 00:47:22,470
um,
toyed with the idea provoking a war with

900
00:47:22,471 --> 00:47:27,471
Great Britain in order to bring 
everybody a steward.

901
00:47:30,010 --> 00:47:32,560
I'm back together,
but,

902
00:47:32,561 --> 00:47:36,220
um,
but nobody really,

903
00:47:36,310 --> 00:47:38,970
at least within Republican Council's 
excepted,

904
00:47:39,430 --> 00:47:41,480
um,
uh,

905
00:47:42,010 --> 00:47:43,900
once,
especially after Fort Sumpter,

906
00:47:44,300 --> 00:47:45,133
uh,
the preservation of the union a becomes 

907
00:47:48,060 --> 00:47:50,890
upper most God,
so most of his presidency,

908
00:47:50,891 --> 00:47:53,290
which obviously was cut short and we'll 
get to that shortly.

909
00:47:53,560 --> 00:47:55,060
Um,
was,

910
00:47:55,061 --> 00:47:57,270
uh,
it was about the civil war is there.

911
00:47:57,320 --> 00:48:00,010
What else do we have to know?
How sort of towards the end of the war,

912
00:48:00,011 --> 00:48:02,470
what other decisions did he make that 
were sort of pivotal?

913
00:48:03,680 --> 00:48:04,600
Um,
well,

914
00:48:04,601 --> 00:48:07,500
he starts a reconstruction program,
uh,

915
00:48:07,750 --> 00:48:10,210
which,
um,

916
00:48:10,450 --> 00:48:13,120
is relatively lenient,
um,

917
00:48:13,150 --> 00:48:15,760
compared to the congressional 
reconstruction,

918
00:48:16,330 --> 00:48:17,163
uh,
that is eventually implemented after a 

919
00:48:20,381 --> 00:48:21,850
whole Lincoln's assassination.

920
00:48:22,630 --> 00:48:23,463
Limited in what regard?
I'm lenient in terms of allowing white 

921
00:48:29,471 --> 00:48:34,471
southerners a free hand in terms of,
of,

922
00:48:35,260 --> 00:48:37,330
uh,
as long as they allow,

923
00:48:37,390 --> 00:48:41,380
had abolished slavery of reentering a,
the union.

924
00:48:41,520 --> 00:48:43,660
And how is that different than what 
happened?

925
00:48:43,661 --> 00:48:44,740
Well,
basically,

926
00:48:44,741 --> 00:48:46,990
um,
uh,

927
00:48:47,200 --> 00:48:48,730
well,
this is a complicated story.

928
00:48:48,731 --> 00:48:50,110
I'm going to try and make it really 
simple.

929
00:48:50,111 --> 00:48:50,944
Okay.
You have this first phase presidential 

930
00:48:52,090 --> 00:48:52,923
reconstruction which Lincoln initiates 
and then becomes really lenient under 

931
00:48:58,540 --> 00:48:59,460
his,
um,

932
00:48:59,740 --> 00:49:00,900
uh,
uh,

933
00:49:01,290 --> 00:49:06,290
a successor,
Andrew Johnson who was from Tennessee.

934
00:49:08,020 --> 00:49:11,980
I'm a very racist,
um,

935
00:49:12,040 --> 00:49:15,530
but antislavery southerner.
Um,

936
00:49:15,820 --> 00:49:20,740
and what happens is that the southern 
states essentially set up,

937
00:49:20,770 --> 00:49:23,440
I'm under a,
um,

938
00:49:23,840 --> 00:49:24,673
uh,
a lot of the former confederate 

939
00:49:26,171 --> 00:49:27,004
leadership,
an apartheid regime with black codes 

940
00:49:29,501 --> 00:49:32,320
that are very restrictive,
uh,

941
00:49:32,321 --> 00:49:33,154
on the,
on the activities of the freed African 

942
00:49:36,790 --> 00:49:40,470
Americans and this outrageous,
um,

943
00:49:41,530 --> 00:49:42,363
northern republicans.
And so you have a period of 

944
00:49:44,951 --> 00:49:49,760
congressional reconstruction where none 
of these governments are there.

945
00:49:49,780 --> 00:49:52,540
They're all disbanded.
You have military occupation,

946
00:49:52,541 --> 00:49:56,710
and then you have the creation of new 
Republican governments in which a lot of

947
00:49:56,711 --> 00:49:57,544
southerners are disenfranchised and 
African Americans are given voting 

948
00:50:03,431 --> 00:50:04,264
rights.
And so you have a period of Republican 

949
00:50:05,801 --> 00:50:09,340
regimes,
I'm in the south,

950
00:50:09,790 --> 00:50:10,623
and then that creates the resistance of 
organizations like the Ku Klux Klan and 

951
00:50:16,391 --> 00:50:19,930
other violent organizations.
And uh,

952
00:50:19,960 --> 00:50:20,793
by 18,
76 northerners have gotten tired of 

953
00:50:22,991 --> 00:50:27,040
trying to maintain these regimes with 
military occupation.

954
00:50:27,500 --> 00:50:31,610
And so you have what's euphemistically 
referred to as redemption where you have

955
00:50:31,611 --> 00:50:34,550
the restoration of a,
of white rule,

956
00:50:35,030 --> 00:50:36,560
um,
throughout the,

957
00:50:36,950 --> 00:50:38,630
uh,
former slave states.

958
00:50:38,790 --> 00:50:39,640
Yeah.
So I,

959
00:50:39,920 --> 00:50:42,910
it's just hard to imagine what a messy 
time it would've been.

960
00:50:42,960 --> 00:50:44,520
Yeah.
During those years,

961
00:50:44,550 --> 00:50:45,383
just healing all those wounds,
literally family members having killed 

962
00:50:48,001 --> 00:50:48,834
each other,
especially in your border states like 

963
00:50:50,701 --> 00:50:52,080
Kentucky and Missouri.
Yeah,

964
00:50:52,081 --> 00:50:53,820
I mean,
it's really just hard to imagine what it

965
00:50:53,821 --> 00:50:54,654
was like.
So the north obviously wins does not 

966
00:50:57,841 --> 00:51:00,270
succeed.
The union is maintained,

967
00:51:00,690 --> 00:51:01,523
uh,
what was happening just in the weeks 

968
00:51:03,001 --> 00:51:05,100
leading up to his assassination?

969
00:51:06,160 --> 00:51:07,210
Well,
Lisa rendered,

970
00:51:08,280 --> 00:51:11,650
um,
a same month,

971
00:51:11,651 --> 00:51:15,670
I believe.
And so it was clear that,

972
00:51:16,060 --> 00:51:17,260
um,
it,

973
00:51:17,620 --> 00:51:18,700
it's,
it's,

974
00:51:18,850 --> 00:51:22,270
it's clear that the,
that the confederacy has lost the war.

975
00:51:22,530 --> 00:51:25,000
Um,
uh,

976
00:51:25,060 --> 00:51:27,220
and,
uh,

977
00:51:27,250 --> 00:51:30,280
you have the passage of the 13th 
amendment,

978
00:51:30,470 --> 00:51:31,720
uh,
by Congress.

979
00:51:31,721 --> 00:51:33,730
It still has to be ratified by the 
states,

980
00:51:34,300 --> 00:51:37,930
um,
a abolishing slavery,

981
00:51:38,740 --> 00:51:40,600
uh,
and,

982
00:51:40,601 --> 00:51:41,261
uh,
those are the,

983
00:51:41,261 --> 00:51:42,910
most,
the two most important,

984
00:51:43,580 --> 00:51:45,820
uh,
events leading up.

985
00:51:46,790 --> 00:51:48,110
Yeah,
through the end of the war.

986
00:51:49,130 --> 00:51:51,380
So to talk about the assassination for a
little bit,

987
00:51:51,620 --> 00:51:52,453
I mean obviously just from everything 
we're talking about it and it was 

988
00:51:54,441 --> 00:51:56,440
wartime and everything else.
Obviously,

989
00:51:56,450 --> 00:51:58,070
you know,
tensions were high and all that.

990
00:51:58,370 --> 00:52:02,180
Was there any reason to believe that 
anything like this was gonna Happen?

991
00:52:02,181 --> 00:52:05,810
I know that may sound like a very open 
question,

992
00:52:05,811 --> 00:52:06,710
but you know,
like we're,

993
00:52:06,711 --> 00:52:09,290
we're there as attempt attack 
assassination attempts.

994
00:52:09,291 --> 00:52:10,220
Before that,
anything,

995
00:52:10,610 --> 00:52:13,460
I was always concerned about Lincoln 
being assassinated,

996
00:52:13,560 --> 00:52:17,200
particularly at the outset of the war.
Uh,

997
00:52:17,280 --> 00:52:18,113
I mean,
pardon me at the outset of his 

998
00:52:20,101 --> 00:52:20,934
administration.
So when he initially comes into 

999
00:52:24,181 --> 00:52:26,160
Washington,
um,

1000
00:52:26,280 --> 00:52:30,990
he comes in disguised because of concern
about,

1001
00:52:31,350 --> 00:52:32,183
uh,
an assassination of rumored 

1002
00:52:33,330 --> 00:52:37,230
assassination attempts.
And then during the inauguration,

1003
00:52:37,830 --> 00:52:39,210
um,
uh,

1004
00:52:39,211 --> 00:52:40,550
you have,
uh,

1005
00:52:40,960 --> 00:52:41,793
a sharp shooters.
I'm stationed at the tops of buildings 

1006
00:52:46,171 --> 00:52:47,004
and,
um,

1007
00:52:47,100 --> 00:52:47,933
uh,
and other provisions made by General 

1008
00:52:50,491 --> 00:52:51,324
Winfield Scott to make sure that there 
is no assassination attempt because 

1009
00:52:55,590 --> 00:52:59,430
remember,
Washington DC is south of Maryland.

1010
00:52:59,431 --> 00:53:02,650
Maryland is a slave state.
Um,

1011
00:53:02,760 --> 00:53:07,760
it's a slave state that doesn't succeed 
only partially because of union military

1012
00:53:09,121 --> 00:53:09,954
force interfering with elections and 
throwing secessionists I'm in jail and 

1013
00:53:15,181 --> 00:53:17,120
Baltimore,
uh,

1014
00:53:17,160 --> 00:53:20,910
is at least at the outset of the war is 
a pro southern,

1015
00:53:21,370 --> 00:53:22,520
um,
hotbed.

1016
00:53:23,420 --> 00:53:26,070
Uh,
so there were concerns.

1017
00:53:26,220 --> 00:53:27,120
Yeah.
Uh,

1018
00:53:27,360 --> 00:53:29,490
but we don't have the secret service.
In fact,

1019
00:53:29,491 --> 00:53:32,340
the secret service has created during 
the civil war,

1020
00:53:33,090 --> 00:53:38,040
mainly to track down counterfeiters.
It's one of the many government agencies

1021
00:53:38,940 --> 00:53:39,960
that we've come to.

1022
00:53:40,050 --> 00:53:40,883
All love emerges during the civil war.
That's why I started to track down 

1023
00:53:45,481 --> 00:53:46,314
counterfeiters.
Now it's clearly gone beyond that scope 

1024
00:53:48,451 --> 00:53:50,460
these days,
but that's a whole other topic.

1025
00:53:50,670 --> 00:53:53,550
So I assume that the day,
I mean,

1026
00:53:53,551 --> 00:53:54,384
if we had to look at Lincoln the morning
he woke up before he went to the 

1027
00:53:56,701 --> 00:53:57,534
theater,
he had to have been feeling pretty good 

1028
00:53:58,861 --> 00:53:59,910
about things.
I mean,

1029
00:53:59,940 --> 00:54:00,773
he had to be accomplished.
The thing that was most important to 

1030
00:54:04,021 --> 00:54:06,630
him,
and he certainly was feeling relieved.

1031
00:54:06,940 --> 00:54:10,080
Yeah.
What should we talk about related to the

1032
00:54:10,081 --> 00:54:12,580
assassination?
Um,

1033
00:54:13,050 --> 00:54:14,600
well,
give me the basics for people.

1034
00:54:15,200 --> 00:54:15,731
Well,
I,

1035
00:54:15,731 --> 00:54:16,564
I don't.
I mean there's now evidence that there 

1036
00:54:22,821 --> 00:54:27,821
was more involvement of a confederate,
um,

1037
00:54:29,610 --> 00:54:32,000
counter intelligence,
whatever you wanna call it.

1038
00:54:32,001 --> 00:54:33,680
Then we previously.
In other words,

1039
00:54:33,681 --> 00:54:38,280
it wasn't entirely.
I'm John Wilkes booth and,

1040
00:54:38,310 --> 00:54:39,650
and his confederates.

1041
00:54:40,490 --> 00:54:42,140
Is there hard evidence on that?
Yeah,

1042
00:54:42,141 --> 00:54:43,070
they,
I've heard little things.

1043
00:54:43,080 --> 00:54:43,913
Yeah.

1044
00:54:43,930 --> 00:54:46,130
Um,
and,

1045
00:54:46,131 --> 00:54:47,670
um,
uh,

1046
00:54:50,200 --> 00:54:52,370
but I don't really have a lot to say 
about,

1047
00:54:52,400 --> 00:54:57,400
about the assassination of Lincoln.
I'm in so far as.

1048
00:54:58,390 --> 00:54:59,330
Okay,
here.

1049
00:54:59,420 --> 00:55:04,130
One of the big debates is if Lincoln 
hadn't been assassinated,

1050
00:55:05,300 --> 00:55:08,050
would he have continued,
um,

1051
00:55:08,600 --> 00:55:11,120
his lenient policy towards,
uh,

1052
00:55:11,121 --> 00:55:11,954
the southern states and um,
and I go along with the historians who 

1053
00:55:18,381 --> 00:55:23,150
say no,
that he was trying.

1054
00:55:23,180 --> 00:55:28,180
I'm leniency in order to try to 
reestablish the whig party.

1055
00:55:29,040 --> 00:55:34,040
I'm in the south,
but it wasn't turning out that way.

1056
00:55:34,940 --> 00:55:35,773
And a congressional reconstruction may 
not have been quite as harsh under 

1057
00:55:40,851 --> 00:55:42,260
Lincoln,
um,

1058
00:55:42,530 --> 00:55:46,120
as it turned out to be without Lincoln.
Uh,

1059
00:55:46,190 --> 00:55:47,630
but,
um,

1060
00:55:48,110 --> 00:55:53,110
but Lincoln's views have evolved to the 
extent that he would not have been,

1061
00:55:54,440 --> 00:55:55,273
uh,
would have been willing to tolerate the 

1062
00:55:56,601 --> 00:55:58,330
black codes that,
um,

1063
00:55:58,460 --> 00:56:01,220
uh,
that the states were setting up,

1064
00:56:01,570 --> 00:56:02,403
do you think,
certainly by his second term where he 

1065
00:56:03,561 --> 00:56:04,394
would've had a freer hand,
he would have done a lot of the things 

1066
00:56:06,171 --> 00:56:07,004
that would,
that happen during congressional 

1067
00:56:08,031 --> 00:56:08,811
reconstruction?
Yeah,

1068
00:56:08,811 --> 00:56:10,070
that's my speculation.
Yeah.

1069
00:56:10,460 --> 00:56:12,530
What was it like after the 
assassination?

1070
00:56:13,540 --> 00:56:15,760
Well,
it's like any assassination,

1071
00:56:15,761 --> 00:56:16,860
you know,
they're,

1072
00:56:16,870 --> 00:56:18,050
um,
there,

1073
00:56:18,051 --> 00:56:23,051
there is a man hunt.
Um,

1074
00:56:23,830 --> 00:56:26,680
there is an attempt to track down the 
conspiracy,

1075
00:56:27,130 --> 00:56:29,590
uh,
and uh,

1076
00:56:30,220 --> 00:56:35,140
you have several conspirators hung 
including Mary Serat who,

1077
00:56:35,200 --> 00:56:38,500
and there's a lot of controversy about 
whether she was actually involved or not

1078
00:56:38,501 --> 00:56:43,300
involved and uh,
uh,

1079
00:56:43,690 --> 00:56:46,810
so it certainly hardens northern 
attitudes.

1080
00:56:47,350 --> 00:56:49,960
Uh,
but remember,

1081
00:56:50,320 --> 00:56:51,153
was there really a feeling that he was 
the one keeping it all together at that 

1082
00:56:53,681 --> 00:56:54,371
point?
Still are,

1083
00:56:54,371 --> 00:56:57,520
or what was the feeling that the war had
been won?

1084
00:56:57,521 --> 00:56:59,410
It was,
it was going to be okay either way,

1085
00:56:59,411 --> 00:57:00,244
you know,
he was such a symbol of what had 

1086
00:57:01,511 --> 00:57:02,344
happened.

1087
00:57:03,780 --> 00:57:05,290
Um,
I mean,

1088
00:57:05,800 --> 00:57:07,150
he,
he had already,

1089
00:57:08,530 --> 00:57:11,530
uh,
that's an interesting question.

1090
00:57:11,800 --> 00:57:15,070
Um,
in some circles,

1091
00:57:15,450 --> 00:57:20,450
um,
he had already become deified but not to

1092
00:57:21,971 --> 00:57:26,710
the extent that the assassination dfi.
Um,

1093
00:57:27,010 --> 00:57:29,170
so,
uh,

1094
00:57:29,380 --> 00:57:31,990
he remember he'd already been elected 
for a second term,

1095
00:57:32,070 --> 00:57:32,903
so,
so he did not face a significant 

1096
00:57:36,701 --> 00:57:41,701
political opposition there.
Was there before the fall of Atlanta,

1097
00:57:41,771 --> 00:57:42,560
there were,
there,

1098
00:57:42,560 --> 00:57:45,160
there because the war dragged on so 
long.

1099
00:57:45,790 --> 00:57:46,623
Um,
it wasn't always clear that Lincoln 

1100
00:57:48,731 --> 00:57:49,564
would be renominated by the Republican 
Party and there were elements in the 

1101
00:57:53,470 --> 00:57:54,570
Republican Party,
um,

1102
00:57:55,170 --> 00:57:58,270
uh,
who wanted to replace him and rivals who

1103
00:57:58,271 --> 00:58:01,780
wanted to replace him.
So,

1104
00:58:02,360 --> 00:58:06,790
uh,
a really,

1105
00:58:06,791 --> 00:58:09,560
um,
uh,

1106
00:58:09,640 --> 00:58:10,473
you,
you have,

1107
00:58:10,480 --> 00:58:12,560
you have Andrew Johnson being president,
you know,

1108
00:58:12,670 --> 00:58:16,420
for most of Lincoln's second term and 
uh,

1109
00:58:16,660 --> 00:58:21,160
he's impeached or almost he's impeached 
and almost removed,

1110
00:58:21,520 --> 00:58:23,770
um,
uh,

1111
00:58:24,340 --> 00:58:27,730
from office because of his disagreement 
with,

1112
00:58:27,750 --> 00:58:31,690
uh,
the Republicans who are in tight control

1113
00:58:31,691 --> 00:58:34,860
of Congress because,
uh,

1114
00:58:34,990 --> 00:58:38,770
the southern states have been kept out,
are still not in,

1115
00:58:38,860 --> 00:58:41,220
um,
except for Tennessee.

1116
00:58:41,610 --> 00:58:44,290
Um,
and the slave states that didn't succeed

1117
00:58:44,370 --> 00:58:45,460
there.
They're still not,

1118
00:58:45,530 --> 00:58:47,120
um,
uh,

1119
00:58:47,140 --> 00:58:47,973
in the union or are permitted to have 
representatives in Congress so the 

1120
00:58:51,491 --> 00:58:52,324
Republicans have a free hand 
irrespective of whether Lincolns in 

1121
00:58:55,781 --> 00:58:59,170
office or Andrew Johnson's and office or
grant is an office.

1122
00:58:59,430 --> 00:59:00,263
Interesting.
So one of the reasons that I wanted to 

1123
00:59:01,461 --> 00:59:02,294
do this youtube week was to help frame 
things around how politics are right 

1124
00:59:06,261 --> 00:59:09,230
now.
So to sort of wrap all this up first,

1125
00:59:09,730 --> 00:59:10,930
um,
what,

1126
00:59:10,980 --> 00:59:11,813
what do you think Lincoln's politics 
would be today if you were to try to 

1127
00:59:15,711 --> 00:59:16,544
take the things that you think he 
believed in the most within the sort of 

1128
00:59:19,431 --> 00:59:22,430
modern context?
Is there a that you can make sense of it

1129
00:59:24,080 --> 00:59:26,330
because I see he gets used by everyone 
all the time.

1130
00:59:26,331 --> 00:59:27,650
Lincoln would have been a Republican for
this.

1131
00:59:27,651 --> 00:59:30,060
He would have been a Democrat for this.
Is there a way

1132
00:59:31,300 --> 00:59:32,660
like playing that game?
Yeah,

1133
00:59:32,890 --> 00:59:34,960
I mean,
things have changed so much.

1134
00:59:35,490 --> 00:59:38,510
Um,
uh,

1135
00:59:39,290 --> 00:59:41,240
um,
it's really,

1136
00:59:41,250 --> 00:59:43,690
it is.
And the context is so different.

1137
00:59:44,160 --> 00:59:45,790
Um,
it's really hard to say.

1138
00:59:46,650 --> 00:59:48,240
Uh,
one of the,

1139
00:59:48,550 --> 00:59:51,010
one of the interesting things about 
Lincoln,

1140
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:52,833
and this is one of my,
one of my sort of reservations are 

1141
00:59:59,801 --> 01:00:00,634
criticisms of Lincoln,
actually criticisms of the people who 

1142
01:00:03,311 --> 01:00:08,311
deify Lincoln as president is the whig 
party,

1143
01:00:08,831 --> 01:00:13,831
had this ambivalent attitude in terms of
government versus the presidency.

1144
01:00:15,340 --> 01:00:16,173
Um,
they were in favor of a lot of 

1145
01:00:17,381 --> 01:00:19,950
government intervention,
um,

1146
01:00:19,990 --> 01:00:20,823
but at the same time they had emerged in
opposition to Andrew Jackson and his 

1147
01:00:24,581 --> 01:00:29,020
very vigorous,
often high handed presidency.

1148
01:00:29,320 --> 01:00:34,320
So they tended to favor the legislature 
as the dominant.

1149
01:00:34,720 --> 01:00:38,110
Uh,
I'm a mover,

1150
01:00:38,530 --> 01:00:42,430
a forest in the government rather than 
the presidency.

1151
01:00:42,970 --> 01:00:47,710
And I think Lincoln had imbibed this wig
attitude,

1152
01:00:48,250 --> 01:00:49,630
uh,
about,

1153
01:00:50,110 --> 01:00:52,660
uh,
administration.

1154
01:00:53,020 --> 01:00:58,020
And as a result,
I think I'm being a wartime president.

1155
01:00:58,510 --> 01:00:59,343
He had to ignore it to a large extent,
but I think that it created some of the 

1156
01:01:05,890 --> 01:01:10,890
administrative problems that emerged 
during Lincoln's presidency.

1157
01:01:12,850 --> 01:01:17,850
So I think Lincoln would be,
we'd have very ambivalent feelings about

1158
01:01:19,871 --> 01:01:24,871
how powerful the president has become a 
within government,

1159
01:01:25,150 --> 01:01:27,550
irrespective of what policies are being 
implemented.

1160
01:01:27,730 --> 01:01:28,563
I will accept.
I will accept that as an answer that 

1161
01:01:30,350 --> 01:01:31,630
that really was what I was trying to get
to,

1162
01:01:31,631 --> 01:01:33,640
not that he would have endorsed this 
policy or that policy,

1163
01:01:33,940 --> 01:01:38,570
but just his general take on what power 
was the opposite of the presidency and,

1164
01:01:38,580 --> 01:01:40,420
and things of that nature.
Well,

1165
01:01:40,421 --> 01:01:41,950
it's been a pleasure talking to you.
I think.

1166
01:01:41,980 --> 01:01:43,030
Are we done?
We're done.

1167
01:01:43,031 --> 01:01:45,520
We did the whole hour.
That was a pretty quick.

1168
01:01:45,521 --> 01:01:47,800
Our.
Do we miss anything made doing this?

1169
01:01:47,801 --> 01:01:48,970
A lot of major things.
Alright.

1170
01:01:49,020 --> 01:01:50,260
Give me something major that we missed.

1171
01:01:50,340 --> 01:01:51,750
Um,
well I,

1172
01:01:51,810 --> 01:01:52,370
uh,
I'll,

1173
01:01:52,370 --> 01:01:53,910
I'll,
I'll give you a couple of things.

1174
01:01:53,911 --> 01:01:56,010
One is,
I mean my book,

1175
01:01:56,040 --> 01:01:57,120
you didn't mention my book.

1176
01:01:57,320 --> 01:01:58,153
Let's talk about your book.
Well I think you've sort of hit on it 

1177
01:01:59,810 --> 01:02:01,280
there.
Your more critical,

1178
01:02:01,640 --> 01:02:05,390
more critical altman in the war then 
some of the people who.

1179
01:02:05,860 --> 01:02:06,693
Yeah,
the book is a narrative history of the 

1180
01:02:07,901 --> 01:02:08,734
civil war,
but I have about half a dozen 

1181
01:02:11,171 --> 01:02:16,171
provocative thesis where I disagree with
trailing views and one of them is that I

1182
01:02:17,321 --> 01:02:22,321
argue that if I'm northerners had been 
interested in ending slavery rather than

1183
01:02:26,581 --> 01:02:27,414
preserving the union,
there is a set of policies they could 

1184
01:02:29,970 --> 01:02:32,940
have adopted.
I'm allowing,

1185
01:02:33,240 --> 01:02:35,710
uh,
the lower south to go in peace,

1186
01:02:35,980 --> 01:02:39,390
uh,
which would have brought down slavery,

1187
01:02:39,710 --> 01:02:41,220
um,
within,

1188
01:02:41,420 --> 01:02:43,530
um,
an independent confederacy,

1189
01:02:43,531 --> 01:02:47,190
certainly by the turn of the century and
possibly within four years.

1190
01:02:47,340 --> 01:02:49,570
Why letting them go would do that.
Um,

1191
01:02:49,800 --> 01:02:52,260
well letting them go didn't necessarily 
do it.

1192
01:02:52,261 --> 01:02:56,010
It just means that you didn't have to 
kill 750,000

1193
01:02:56,011 --> 01:02:58,230
people in order to bring about the end 
of slavery.

1194
01:02:58,710 --> 01:02:59,910
In other words,
I think there were,

1195
01:03:00,280 --> 01:03:01,113
there is there a set of policies that 
could achieve the same goal at less 

1196
01:03:04,411 --> 01:03:05,244
cost.

1197
01:03:05,310 --> 01:03:07,260
Um,
and,

1198
01:03:07,261 --> 01:03:09,210
um,
and in other words,

1199
01:03:09,211 --> 01:03:10,950
I think you can,
like the,

1200
01:03:10,980 --> 01:03:11,813
I was actually t I'm tuned,
don turned onto this alternative by 

1201
01:03:17,370 --> 01:03:19,700
garrison and the other radical 
abolitionist.

1202
01:03:19,730 --> 01:03:23,680
In other words,
you can be a rabidly antislavery instill

1203
01:03:23,800 --> 01:03:26,240
procession.
Um,

1204
01:03:26,310 --> 01:03:28,160
the second,
uh,

1205
01:03:28,260 --> 01:03:31,350
important argument I make is,
has to do with,

1206
01:03:31,770 --> 01:03:33,570
uh,
the growth of government.

1207
01:03:34,080 --> 01:03:35,970
Um,
um,

1208
01:03:36,900 --> 01:03:37,733
uh,
I think it's a commonplace observation 

1209
01:03:40,741 --> 01:03:41,574
that government today is a lot more 
powerful and a lot more intrusive than 

1210
01:03:45,181 --> 01:03:46,014
it was earlier in our history.
And whether you think that's a good 

1211
01:03:50,041 --> 01:03:52,230
thing or a bad thing,
uh,

1212
01:03:52,530 --> 01:03:55,980
there's the question of what changed and
what brought about the change.

1213
01:03:55,981 --> 01:04:00,120
So I'm the popular story is that it's 
the new deal,

1214
01:04:00,240 --> 01:04:01,073
right?
That made the big change and I'm in the 

1215
01:04:03,901 --> 01:04:06,120
growth of government and I think that's 
mistaken,

1216
01:04:07,080 --> 01:04:09,040
it's mistaken,
uh,

1217
01:04:09,041 --> 01:04:09,874
in part because of the new deal was 
essentially a recreation of Woodrow 

1218
01:04:14,760 --> 01:04:15,900
Wilson's war collectivism.

1219
01:04:16,410 --> 01:04:17,243
And the impact of the new deal on 
government was dwarfed by the impact of 

1220
01:04:22,141 --> 01:04:24,050
World War II.
Um,

1221
01:04:24,190 --> 01:04:27,330
now there's some elements of truth.
The new deal gives you social security,

1222
01:04:27,490 --> 01:04:28,323
um,
and along with Medicare that's become 

1223
01:04:30,271 --> 01:04:33,780
government's biggest expenditures.
More sophisticated,

1224
01:04:33,810 --> 01:04:34,643
um,
commentators would push the change back 

1225
01:04:38,521 --> 01:04:41,190
to the progressive era in the early 20th
century.

1226
01:04:41,191 --> 01:04:42,024
But I'm arguing that the civil war is 
the crucial watershed in American 

1227
01:04:45,571 --> 01:04:48,600
history that prior to that,
prior to the civil war,

1228
01:04:48,840 --> 01:04:49,673
the longterm secular trend had at all 
levels of government for government to 

1229
01:04:54,031 --> 01:04:56,310
become smaller,
less intrusive,

1230
01:04:56,311 --> 01:04:57,144
less involved in people's lives.
And that the turning point is the civil 

1231
01:05:02,641 --> 01:05:06,780
war that leaves him with a complex 
legacy from the government.

1232
01:05:06,790 --> 01:05:07,740
Yes,
yes.

1233
01:05:07,850 --> 01:05:08,820
Yeah.
Interesting.

1234
01:05:08,910 --> 01:05:10,950
Yeah.
Because during the civil war,

1235
01:05:10,951 --> 01:05:13,170
I mean,
national conscription,

1236
01:05:13,560 --> 01:05:18,560
I'm a US moves from free to high 
protective tariffs,

1237
01:05:19,150 --> 01:05:21,640
uh,
the first Western country to do.

1238
01:05:21,641 --> 01:05:26,641
So I'm a massive subsidies to railroads,
uh,

1239
01:05:28,300 --> 01:05:31,780
for subsidies to higher education 
through the land grants.

1240
01:05:32,130 --> 01:05:35,050
Um,
and I've already gone over my time.

1241
01:05:35,051 --> 01:05:35,884
I could go on.

1242
01:05:37,280 --> 01:05:39,140
You got one more,
one more big,

1243
01:05:39,200 --> 01:05:40,890
big point that's in the book related.

1244
01:05:41,910 --> 01:05:42,743
Yeah.
One more point that's related to 

1245
01:05:43,521 --> 01:05:44,610
Lincoln.
Um,

1246
01:05:45,260 --> 01:05:48,470
uh,
I think that one of the reasons it takes

1247
01:05:48,471 --> 01:05:49,304
the union so long to defeat the 
confederacy is because of Lincoln's bad 

1248
01:05:54,321 --> 01:05:57,770
administration of the military.
Uh,

1249
01:05:58,050 --> 01:06:02,030
there,
he tended to micromanage.

1250
01:06:02,420 --> 01:06:05,170
I'm the war.
Uh,

1251
01:06:05,570 --> 01:06:08,300
uh,
like Lyndon Johnson tried to micromanage

1252
01:06:08,301 --> 01:06:09,134
the Vietnam war and historians want to 
place all of the blame on Lincoln's 

1253
01:06:16,070 --> 01:06:18,200
generals.
Uh,

1254
01:06:18,680 --> 01:06:22,580
whereas I think that really the source 
of the problem is Lincoln.

1255
01:06:23,140 --> 01:06:25,590
Um,
consider the eastern theater.

1256
01:06:25,620 --> 01:06:26,540
All right,
so,

1257
01:06:27,040 --> 01:06:29,510
um,
you have a succession of commanders.

1258
01:06:29,870 --> 01:06:31,990
Irvin Mcdowell defeated the first bull 
run,

1259
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:35,780
replaced my Mcclellan Mcclellan is 
almost supplanted by John Pope,

1260
01:06:35,781 --> 01:06:36,614
who's defeated the second bull run only 
to bring back McClellan then to replace 

1261
01:06:39,801 --> 01:06:40,634
him with burnside who admitted to him 
emitted that he wasn't ready to command 

1262
01:06:44,721 --> 01:06:48,770
the army and then hooker and then meet 
right now normally.

1263
01:06:48,890 --> 01:06:49,723
Right?
And this is within a period of two 

1264
01:06:50,931 --> 01:06:51,764
years,
two,

1265
01:06:51,980 --> 01:06:55,010
two and a half years.
Normally this doesn't work.

1266
01:06:55,070 --> 01:07:00,070
Earn administrators high marks in terms 
of how they're managing things.

1267
01:07:04,790 --> 01:07:06,260
Right?
And,

1268
01:07:06,280 --> 01:07:07,730
uh,
I think that,

1269
01:07:07,731 --> 01:07:08,564
um,
I mean there were problems with all the 

1270
01:07:10,401 --> 01:07:11,600
generals.
Uh,

1271
01:07:11,601 --> 01:07:12,434
the advantage that the generals in the 
West had Sherman and grant is they 

1272
01:07:15,771 --> 01:07:19,910
weren't micromanaged by Lincoln and 
therefore they could make their mistakes

1273
01:07:19,911 --> 01:07:21,650
early in the war and learn from them.

1274
01:07:21,890 --> 01:07:22,671
Yeah.
Well,

1275
01:07:22,671 --> 01:07:24,530
I liked that you gave us a complex view.
I mean,

1276
01:07:24,531 --> 01:07:26,600
that's really why I wanted to do this,
that,

1277
01:07:26,601 --> 01:07:27,950
you know,
we picked certain ones.

1278
01:07:28,130 --> 01:07:28,963
Lincoln is one that we all sort of view 
in this lens of the perfect being 

1279
01:07:35,320 --> 01:07:38,270
Lincoln of course.
And of course he did a tremendous amount

1280
01:07:38,271 --> 01:07:39,300
of good.
Uh,

1281
01:07:39,320 --> 01:07:43,370
but it's interesting hearing what the 
little imperfections are a and all sorts

1282
01:07:43,371 --> 01:07:44,570
of things.
So on that note,

1283
01:07:44,571 --> 01:07:47,420
it has been a pleasure talking to you 
and for more,

1284
01:07:47,421 --> 01:07:48,410
uh,
Jeffrey Rogers,

1285
01:07:48,440 --> 01:07:49,273
I'm all check out his book,
which we're going to link to write down 

1286
01:07:52,640 --> 01:07:53,473
below.
