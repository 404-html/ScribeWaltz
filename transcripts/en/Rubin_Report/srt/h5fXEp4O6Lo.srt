1
00:00:01,930 --> 00:00:02,830
Right.
All right.

2
00:00:02,850 --> 00:00:03,683
There is a ton.
I have to talk to you guys about this 

3
00:00:05,340 --> 00:00:06,061
week.
As you probably know,

4
00:00:06,061 --> 00:00:10,170
I was in Israel last week where I was 
invited to speak at a video conference.

5
00:00:10,410 --> 00:00:11,243
The remainder of the week was spent 
wandering the streets talking to people 

6
00:00:13,441 --> 00:00:16,530
about peace and eating ridiculous 
amounts of Hummus.

7
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:17,753
Spending most of my time in Tel Aviv,
I saw people have pretty much every 

8
00:00:20,161 --> 00:00:21,090
race,
color,

9
00:00:21,091 --> 00:00:23,670
religion,
ethnicity and nationality,

10
00:00:23,671 --> 00:00:25,680
living side by side.
I heard Hebrew,

11
00:00:25,681 --> 00:00:26,730
Arabic,
English,

12
00:00:26,731 --> 00:00:27,870
French,
Spanish,

13
00:00:27,871 --> 00:00:28,860
Japanese,
German,

14
00:00:28,861 --> 00:00:33,861
and several other languages being spoken
simultaneously in restaurants in cafes.

15
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:37,890
I saw a coexistence in a part of the 
world that has very little of it.

16
00:00:38,010 --> 00:00:38,843
I also spent a day in Jerusalem.
If you saw the video that we posted a 

17
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:42,833
couple of days ago.
I tried to show how close these 

18
00:00:43,951 --> 00:00:44,784
religious sites are and give a little 
context to an extremely small yet 

19
00:00:48,421 --> 00:00:51,540
complex city walking through the old 
city of Jerusalem.

20
00:00:51,540 --> 00:00:52,373
I explored the Jewish and Christian 
quarters and stop for falafel and the 

21
00:00:55,321 --> 00:00:58,380
Arab quarter.
I felt it was important not just to talk

22
00:00:58,381 --> 00:01:01,680
about these places as we do,
but actually to live them as well.

23
00:01:01,950 --> 00:01:02,783
I exited the Old City at the Damascus 
Gate where literally a day before a Jew 

24
00:01:06,151 --> 00:01:06,984
had been stabbed.
While there was no doubt the 

25
00:01:08,461 --> 00:01:09,294
neighborhood was tense,
there was also a feeling that this was 

26
00:01:11,221 --> 00:01:12,840
life.
Life goes on.

27
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:14,993
Unfortunately.
I heard about the San Bernardino 

28
00:01:16,411 --> 00:01:18,450
terrorist attacks while on the beach in 
Israel.

29
00:01:18,451 --> 00:01:19,284
I can't really explain to you guys how 
incredibly surreal it was to be so far 

30
00:01:23,071 --> 00:01:23,904
away from something so horrific 
happening 60 miles away from where I 

31
00:01:26,461 --> 00:01:29,880
live while I was 7,600
miles away from home.

32
00:01:30,390 --> 00:01:31,223
Adding to the surreal feeling was that I
was in the Epi center of a country that 

33
00:01:34,171 --> 00:01:38,040
deals with terrorism in some form or 
another pretty much every day.

34
00:01:38,430 --> 00:01:39,263
Suddenly I had people asking me what it 
was like to be in America with all our 

35
00:01:42,661 --> 00:01:45,720
mass shootings.
The world felt completely flipped on its

36
00:01:45,721 --> 00:01:46,554
head.
On the 14 hour plane ride back to Los 

37
00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:49,013
Angeles,
I read what's left by my guest this 

38
00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:53,040
week.
Nicole and nick is a writer for time.

39
00:01:53,041 --> 00:01:55,350
Spectator,
the observer and standpoint,

40
00:01:55,710 --> 00:01:56,543
his first book,
what's left is an absolute must read if 

41
00:01:59,011 --> 00:02:02,760
you dig what we do here though,
what's left was written in 2017.

42
00:02:02,761 --> 00:02:03,594
Nick absolutely nails so much of the 
lunacy we've been talking about on the 

43
00:02:07,261 --> 00:02:08,094
left these days from their dishonest 
tactics of lying about opponents' views 

44
00:02:11,401 --> 00:02:15,150
to aligning themselves with people who 
are just as easily have them killed.

45
00:02:15,510 --> 00:02:16,343
He goes on a journey through history to 
show how the far left has so often 

46
00:02:19,951 --> 00:02:22,980
strengthened the very ideas that they 
purport to be against.

47
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:26,160
There were so many passages of the book 
that I felt like could have been written

48
00:02:26,161 --> 00:02:26,994
today,
that it was almost like reading 

49
00:02:27,961 --> 00:02:29,010
something from the future.

50
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:32,190
He nailed the regressive left before the
term was even out there.

51
00:02:32,250 --> 00:02:33,083
Speaking of the regressives,
you didn't think I was going to get 

52
00:02:34,261 --> 00:02:35,940
through a show without mentioning them 
data?

53
00:02:36,090 --> 00:02:37,440
Yeah.
Not gonna happen.

54
00:02:37,470 --> 00:02:38,303
Uh,
one of the issues I've called them out 

55
00:02:39,511 --> 00:02:41,880
on consistently is that if they don't 
stop smearing,

56
00:02:41,881 --> 00:02:45,180
the liberals willing to talk about 
Islamic extremism,

57
00:02:45,390 --> 00:02:47,790
that they're going to hand our future to
the far right.

58
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:48,833
We're seeing this right this very second
across Europe as far right parties are 

59
00:02:51,901 --> 00:02:52,734
winning elections and gaining in the 
polls from France to Belgium to Sweden 

60
00:02:55,741 --> 00:02:56,574
and more.
This is clearly coming to the American 

61
00:02:58,381 --> 00:02:59,214
shores,
right,

62
00:02:59,380 --> 00:03:00,213
too.
As Donald trump just this week called 

63
00:03:01,991 --> 00:03:05,080
for denying Muslims entry into the 
United States.

64
00:03:05,530 --> 00:03:09,190
Obviously this is idiotic over the top 
and ridiculous,

65
00:03:09,370 --> 00:03:10,203
but it can only exist in a climate where
fear of real discussion has been 

66
00:03:13,451 --> 00:03:14,284
stifled.
If we aren't afraid of talking about 

67
00:03:16,511 --> 00:03:19,420
Islamism,
especially the difference between people

68
00:03:19,421 --> 00:03:20,254
and doctrine,
then we can finally have an honest 

69
00:03:22,241 --> 00:03:25,900
conversation about refugees,
immigration and everything else,

70
00:03:26,230 --> 00:03:27,063
but if we do,
as the regressives are doing this very 

71
00:03:28,811 --> 00:03:29,644
second by making no distinction between 
people who are trying to talk about 

72
00:03:33,491 --> 00:03:36,670
serious issues versus people who trade 
on fear,

73
00:03:36,910 --> 00:03:40,330
then we help the real xenophobes and 
silence the reformers.

74
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:42,033
Even as a kid,
I always loved John f Kennedy's famous 

75
00:03:43,481 --> 00:03:46,210
quote.
We have nothing to fear but fear itself.

76
00:03:46,510 --> 00:03:47,343
It's lofty and big,
but it hits something that is extremely 

77
00:03:49,601 --> 00:03:50,434
human.
Sometimes fear and things is scarier 

78
00:03:52,931 --> 00:03:53,764
than the actual thing itself.
That's not to say that radical Islam is 

79
00:03:56,900 --> 00:03:57,733
scary,
but we also feed that fear if we don't 

80
00:04:00,221 --> 00:04:01,054
deal with it honestly,
now that we live in a time when people 

81
00:04:03,011 --> 00:04:06,040
are incredibly fearful and much of it is
with good reason,

82
00:04:06,041 --> 00:04:10,810
as we've seen the spread of an evil 
ideology with no signs of letting up,

83
00:04:11,140 --> 00:04:15,340
that doesn't mean we have to be afraid 
to speak out against it or silence those

84
00:04:15,341 --> 00:04:17,410
who dare to do so.
Actually,

85
00:04:17,411 --> 00:04:22,120
of course it means the exact opposite.
Fear is what the regressives and the far

86
00:04:22,121 --> 00:04:22,954
right are both going to use to splinter 
us against each other so they can gain 

87
00:04:25,601 --> 00:04:26,410
power.

88
00:04:26,410 --> 00:04:28,750
The world is in a strange,
fearful moment,

89
00:04:28,751 --> 00:04:29,950
right?
This very second,

90
00:04:30,130 --> 00:04:33,910
we can either give into our worst 
impulses or try to be better.

91
00:04:34,180 --> 00:04:36,550
I'm pretty sure you guys know which side
I'm going to choose.

92
00:04:37,510 --> 00:04:39,550
As we sat in a packed restaurant in Tel 
Aviv,

93
00:04:39,551 --> 00:04:43,810
I asked a friend how he feels about all 
the stabbings without missing a beat.

94
00:04:43,811 --> 00:04:45,430
He said,
we have to keep living.

95
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:46,353
We have no choice.
I think we could all use a little of 

96
00:04:48,371 --> 00:04:49,204
that spirit right now.
Let's not give into fear fed to us by 

97
00:04:52,211 --> 00:04:54,700
terrorists or fear fed to us by 
politicians.

98
00:04:54,940 --> 00:04:55,773
Let's keep fighting because if we don't 
choice is exactly what we're going to 

99
00:04:59,201 --> 00:05:00,034
give up.

100
00:05:02,390 --> 00:05:04,850
I guess this week is a writer for the 
Observer,

101
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:08,390
the spectator time and standpoint.
He's authored two books.

102
00:05:08,660 --> 00:05:11,000
You can't read this book and what's 
left.

103
00:05:11,030 --> 00:05:14,350
I just read what's left and I'm thrilled
to have him here.

104
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:16,210
Nicole,
and welcome to the show mark.

105
00:05:17,270 --> 00:05:18,103
So Nick,
I was telling you right before we 

106
00:05:18,921 --> 00:05:20,600
started,
I just read the book,

107
00:05:20,601 --> 00:05:21,434
so all of your thoughts in what's left 
are there right at the tip of my brain 

108
00:05:25,191 --> 00:05:27,110
right now,
and I loved it.

109
00:05:27,111 --> 00:05:32,111
I have been so in this regressive left 
thing this far left that your whole,

110
00:05:33,620 --> 00:05:36,950
your whole book is about and you saw it.
You saw it early.

111
00:05:36,951 --> 00:05:39,020
So I want to get to that,
but before we start,

112
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:40,153
give me some of your liberal credentials
because I want people to know that 

113
00:05:43,371 --> 00:05:44,204
you're a lefty,
but because we're going to talk shit 

114
00:05:46,371 --> 00:05:47,204
about the left.
So I want people to know you're an 

115
00:05:47,781 --> 00:05:48,614
actual lefty,

116
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:53,273
Britain and Europe.
You wouldn't call me a liberal 

117
00:05:57,170 --> 00:05:58,220
socialist,
left

118
00:05:58,650 --> 00:06:03,580
a way for whatever his problems and they
are manifest and man,

119
00:06:03,581 --> 00:06:04,414
if bold,
because you didn't really cover it at 

120
00:06:06,411 --> 00:06:07,244
great length in America,
used to believe in things like tourism 

121
00:06:12,210 --> 00:06:13,043
and antique fascism in feminism to an 
extent in being a part of the party of 

122
00:06:19,551 --> 00:06:22,490
progress.
And it used to have some idea of what to

123
00:06:22,491 --> 00:06:23,324
do with the world.
And I gradually realized looking around 

124
00:06:26,781 --> 00:06:27,614
me,
but this was no longer the case that as 

125
00:06:29,001 --> 00:06:29,834
you like,
if you want to post it in sort of 

126
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:31,520
really,
um,

127
00:06:31,900 --> 00:06:36,470
a road rubbish terms really,
this know I didn't leave less,

128
00:06:36,471 --> 00:06:37,190
less,
less meat,

129
00:06:37,190 --> 00:06:38,980
less somebody's true,
but the,

130
00:06:39,100 --> 00:06:42,620
the,
there was no longer a universal leftwing

131
00:06:42,650 --> 00:06:45,740
mess with which meant that people around
the world could say,

132
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:46,933
look,
we're oppressed and we're oppressed by 

133
00:06:48,380 --> 00:06:51,530
heaviest reactionary forces.
The less wind resources.

134
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:52,513
So being in the UK,
I've had a bunch of my guests have been 

135
00:06:55,490 --> 00:06:56,323
lefties in the UK that are,
that are talking about the same issues 

136
00:06:59,751 --> 00:07:00,584
that you're talking about.
What is going on in the UK that I think 

137
00:07:03,531 --> 00:07:07,700
woke you guys up to this before it was 
awoken in America?

138
00:07:07,701 --> 00:07:10,220
Because really here,
it's only in the last year.

139
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:14,360
I think that that liberals are waking up
to what's going on on our side.

140
00:07:15,110 --> 00:07:15,943
Yeah.
Whatever happens in America happens in 

141
00:07:20,131 --> 00:07:24,270
Brooklyn and your five years later for 
one since the other way round,

142
00:07:24,570 --> 00:07:25,403
I think that really big arguments and 
big battles we've had in Brisbane in 

143
00:07:28,171 --> 00:07:31,350
particular all now coming to America,
you know,

144
00:07:31,380 --> 00:07:32,213
the,
the,

145
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:35,720
the Alice has been reversed the bit.
Um,

146
00:07:35,950 --> 00:07:38,590
there has been the most,
uh,

147
00:07:38,670 --> 00:07:42,170
for Roche rouse head,
which I'm pleased about because,

148
00:07:42,260 --> 00:07:43,093
you know,
I'm a on polemicists system that Swiss 

149
00:07:44,860 --> 00:07:49,860
blendable I don't believe that the being
pc and nice and kind and gentle is a way

150
00:07:51,541 --> 00:07:54,330
of sorting out problems is often a way 
of covering them up.

151
00:07:54,750 --> 00:07:57,300
But there have been huge rounds in 
Britain,

152
00:07:57,810 --> 00:08:01,590
uh,
really since nine slash 11 in my case,

153
00:08:01,591 --> 00:08:04,100
since the Iraq war,
which mouse might seem rather wrong,

154
00:08:04,130 --> 00:08:05,320
but,
uh,

155
00:08:05,820 --> 00:08:06,653
your older may remember your faculty to 
credit viewers may remember the won't 

156
00:08:12,401 --> 00:08:13,234
set on the saying was the enemy if left,
left wing is used to campaign in favor 

157
00:08:18,451 --> 00:08:21,920
of rights for the Kurds and pools have 
damaged Sadam Hussein and fashion is.

158
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:24,720
So in my case,
it wasn't nine slash 11,

159
00:08:24,721 --> 00:08:28,260
it was 2003 with the Iraq war.
And I says,

160
00:08:28,270 --> 00:08:28,771
well,
thinking,

161
00:08:28,771 --> 00:08:29,310
well,
you know,

162
00:08:29,310 --> 00:08:32,000
what happened to all my youth?
Why are,

163
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:35,140
why are you European?
Lester's food reason to,

164
00:08:35,170 --> 00:08:36,003
you know,
help.

165
00:08:36,170 --> 00:08:37,003
You never need a good reason to.
There are plenty of good reasons for 

166
00:08:39,111 --> 00:08:41,500
post George W Bush.
Um,

167
00:08:41,501 --> 00:08:42,334
but,
um,

168
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:43,940
why,
why,

169
00:08:43,970 --> 00:08:44,803
why was it,
there was simply no concern for courage 

170
00:08:48,061 --> 00:08:48,894
in the Ra for socialist in the wrongful 
trade unions from the rock who had been 

171
00:08:52,561 --> 00:08:56,670
until the late eighties.
Uh,

172
00:08:56,930 --> 00:08:59,130
yeah,
that'd be demos to bound them.

173
00:08:59,131 --> 00:08:59,964
That'd be petitioning to that support.
They've kind of at my parents home or 

174
00:09:02,911 --> 00:09:05,350
that kind of thing.
And you want to go,

175
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:06,330
well,
what happened there?

176
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:09,150
And once you start asking that question,
very simple question,

177
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:13,270
who are your friends who to use old left
wing Lang Lang,

178
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:14,490
joy,
your comrades,

179
00:09:14,870 --> 00:09:17,540
uh,
who you sticking up for whatever kind of

180
00:09:17,550 --> 00:09:20,280
Chris would you want to be of American 
policy or public policy?

181
00:09:20,281 --> 00:09:22,360
And our piece again,
opt for an interview.

182
00:09:23,150 --> 00:09:27,720
There are always good grounds because of
American British policy who you actually

183
00:09:27,721 --> 00:09:28,554
supporting.
And then you get some rather ugly 

184
00:09:30,691 --> 00:09:31,524
answers and you,
you find a source of great vacuum on or 

185
00:09:36,421 --> 00:09:37,254
most of the left and many good left wing
is on most of the left were a principal 

186
00:09:41,130 --> 00:09:42,300
ideology or to be.

187
00:09:42,580 --> 00:09:43,900
Yeah.
So right there.

188
00:09:43,901 --> 00:09:47,590
I mean you hit a lot of the books.
So a lot of the book deals directly with

189
00:09:47,591 --> 00:09:48,424
Iraq and how it woke you up as you just 
sat in the horrible things that Saddam 

190
00:09:50,921 --> 00:09:55,040
was doing and the horrible things that 
the bath party was up to.

191
00:09:55,250 --> 00:09:58,000
Um,
so before we get into that,

192
00:09:58,001 --> 00:10:01,820
because I was actually surprised how 
much of your journey was through Iraq.

193
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:03,370
But before we get into that,
specifically,

194
00:10:03,610 --> 00:10:04,443
the phrase regressive left,
so it was coined by marginalized and 

195
00:10:07,131 --> 00:10:07,964
it's really,
it's really taken off here and end at 

196
00:10:09,641 --> 00:10:11,530
the beginning.
At the beginning of the book,

197
00:10:11,531 --> 00:10:14,890
you mentioned that you didn't 
necessarily have a word for this and you

198
00:10:14,891 --> 00:10:17,260
said you didn't want to get too hung up 
sort of onwards.

199
00:10:17,261 --> 00:10:19,090
Do you like the phrase regressive left?

200
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:24,760
I'm sure there's something else.
Here's the thing,

201
00:10:25,490 --> 00:10:30,260
a waltz graph came out in 2007.
I'm might go,

202
00:10:30,330 --> 00:10:31,190
I'm,
I'm old.

203
00:10:32,110 --> 00:10:36,720
I'm old.
No revolution like Kaboosh kids.

204
00:10:37,580 --> 00:10:38,413
The reason I didn't,
I love the French progressive lesson is 

205
00:10:40,941 --> 00:10:41,774
absolutely right.
The reason why I didn't put a name to 

206
00:10:44,901 --> 00:10:45,734
it,
this,

207
00:10:46,970 --> 00:10:50,840
you can say a very easy,
obviously it's just a fall next,

208
00:10:51,020 --> 00:10:52,940
uh,
people who used to be Marxist,

209
00:10:52,941 --> 00:10:54,350
Leninist,
trotskyists,

210
00:10:54,710 --> 00:10:56,240
starbucks,
what have you.

211
00:10:56,870 --> 00:11:00,350
But here's the problem.
When you interrogate these attitudes,

212
00:11:01,010 --> 00:11:02,810
they go way,
way,

213
00:11:02,811 --> 00:11:03,644
way into the mainstream.
It's people who don't consider 

214
00:11:05,571 --> 00:11:07,120
themselves less than at all.
I mean,

215
00:11:07,130 --> 00:11:07,963
typically in Britain,
I'm sure this is true in America as 

216
00:11:09,141 --> 00:11:10,090
well,
from what I've seen,

217
00:11:10,410 --> 00:11:15,110
it's people in broadcasting.
It's people in universities,

218
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:18,890
people in schools,
it's people in publishing.

219
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:22,910
It's people who are,
you know,

220
00:11:23,060 --> 00:11:25,000
you had to define themselves and quite 
favorable,

221
00:11:25,190 --> 00:11:29,120
but then have a load of ideas,
a lot of baggage on them,

222
00:11:29,540 --> 00:11:33,580
the terrible ideas we've started on the 
far left and,

223
00:11:33,660 --> 00:11:34,493
and this,
this is what grows people wilds in 

224
00:11:35,971 --> 00:11:36,240
Britain.

225
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:37,073
But this book was because I wasn't just 
talking about how some people on the 

226
00:11:40,371 --> 00:11:43,700
friends and all sorts of talking about 
people here in Britain will say,

227
00:11:43,701 --> 00:11:48,701
BBC site people who never considered 
himself extreme all with themselves,

228
00:11:49,180 --> 00:11:51,010
models and new.
I'm not going to say,

229
00:11:51,011 --> 00:11:51,844
well look,
these are ideas that began on the phone 

230
00:11:54,451 --> 00:11:55,284
and that it's okay to go along with 
great dreams and movements that want to 

231
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:04,190
subsidize the women kill.
Hadn't sexuals kill Jews,

232
00:12:04,380 --> 00:12:05,213
kill any Muslim who have his or her own 
free will decides to change their 

233
00:12:09,551 --> 00:12:12,250
religion.
There is no god,

234
00:12:12,251 --> 00:12:15,700
there is no our tool.
You're getting along with all of this.

235
00:12:15,850 --> 00:12:18,040
It wouldn't matter if it was gas six 
grade,

236
00:12:18,580 --> 00:12:22,930
what masters is permeating the whole 
liberal,

237
00:12:22,980 --> 00:12:24,260
um,
uh,

238
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:25,330
uh,
uh,

239
00:12:25,410 --> 00:12:26,243
a spectrum.
And that's what growth people wild 

240
00:12:28,570 --> 00:12:29,403
available.
So to me that was so obviously true and 

241
00:12:33,401 --> 00:12:35,830
it seems to be true of as American as 
well,

242
00:12:36,370 --> 00:12:37,203
so you hit on a lot there.
So partly it seems to me that it's a 

243
00:12:39,121 --> 00:12:40,800
little bit like the phrase,
you know,

244
00:12:40,801 --> 00:12:41,720
the road,
uh,

245
00:12:41,790 --> 00:12:45,720
the road to hell is paved with good 
intentions that these people,

246
00:12:45,721 --> 00:12:47,970
and I think you hit on this advantage 
that these people,

247
00:12:47,971 --> 00:12:48,804
they have good intentions in that they 
don't want extra war and we have had a 

248
00:12:53,341 --> 00:12:55,080
ridiculous,
both of our countries,

249
00:12:55,081 --> 00:12:57,090
right?
You in the UK and in America we've had,

250
00:12:58,890 --> 00:13:02,970
we have had plenty of ridiculous 
unnecessary wars.

251
00:13:02,971 --> 00:13:04,800
We've done all kinds of things,
drone strikes,

252
00:13:04,801 --> 00:13:08,340
all of these things that we on the left 
are not thrilled with,

253
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:10,073
but you make a really good argument for 
what is the alternative that we 

254
00:13:13,921 --> 00:13:14,754
basically just give up on all of these 
people that live under these horrible 

255
00:13:18,151 --> 00:13:18,984
theocracies.
And that's what put these people in the 

256
00:13:20,611 --> 00:13:23,100
far left in bed with some really 
terrible people.

257
00:13:23,530 --> 00:13:28,000
Yeah.
It's also a,

258
00:13:28,260 --> 00:13:31,220
if you could get a time machine and go 
into the future,

259
00:13:32,140 --> 00:13:37,100
say 50 years into the future,
there are bound to be all kinds of ideas

260
00:13:37,110 --> 00:13:37,943
are accepted.
The objects on the fringes of American 

261
00:13:40,911 --> 00:13:43,400
society at the moment.
Uh,

262
00:13:43,890 --> 00:13:46,520
all your great panggang drums in the 
media,

263
00:13:46,550 --> 00:13:47,383
Time magazine,
New York Times barely even think about 

264
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:51,313
will be the common sense.
Whatever age that applies to paddle 

265
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:54,433
ideas as well as good ideas.
A really bad idea started on the far 

266
00:13:59,241 --> 00:14:00,074
left.
I would even say it wasn't even less 

267
00:14:00,951 --> 00:14:03,740
wind at all after the collapse of 
communism,

268
00:14:03,980 --> 00:14:04,813
after the end of socialist and members,
socialism defines what it means to be a 

269
00:14:08,631 --> 00:14:11,320
left winger for a hundred years.
You know,

270
00:14:11,370 --> 00:14:14,860
some fruits are not,
they're not all girls.

271
00:14:15,470 --> 00:14:17,060
Then somebody there,
all these people.

272
00:14:17,061 --> 00:14:20,630
I mean,
noam is a classic example to me who have

273
00:14:20,631 --> 00:14:24,770
that same spirit but no longer have an 
ideology they can believe in.

274
00:14:25,250 --> 00:14:26,083
And so what did they do?
They still just send anyone who is 

275
00:14:30,711 --> 00:14:34,880
against the West can't be all bad.
Anyone who is against the west,

276
00:14:34,881 --> 00:14:35,714
it has to be the West fault.
We all the root cause to use a phrase 

277
00:14:40,191 --> 00:14:44,690
that's been repeated to and then you 
suddenly find people who call themselves

278
00:14:44,930 --> 00:14:49,930
radicals or progressive socialist 
feminists going along with movements.

279
00:14:50,841 --> 00:14:55,841
We anti progressive and she says,
Auntie radical anti women,

280
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,410
anti gay,
anti Semitic,

281
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:58,273
and she everything,
Auntie liberal in the classic sense 

282
00:15:01,490 --> 00:15:02,323
actually movements that have stepped out
for a liberal nightmare if you look at 

283
00:15:05,271 --> 00:15:07,040
their effects,
but because they're anti west,

284
00:15:07,340 --> 00:15:08,173
that's all that matters is because 
there's no longer a positive program 

285
00:15:11,180 --> 00:15:12,013
would be laughing.
They just seize on any body who is 

286
00:15:14,930 --> 00:15:16,230
against America,
again,

287
00:15:16,250 --> 00:15:17,083
against to you Sarah rather contentious.
Then you can have an organist bath we 

288
00:15:20,011 --> 00:15:20,844
want later against imperialism,
and that that just stops on the 

289
00:15:24,151 --> 00:15:24,780
extremes.

290
00:15:24,780 --> 00:15:29,780
Like good ideas start off on the fringes
and it comes into the main screen.

291
00:15:30,740 --> 00:15:33,500
Now that's not wholly the faults.
Mainstream liberals,

292
00:15:33,510 --> 00:15:37,760
senior,
never let drop your books off the whole.

293
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:39,440
Nevertheless,
Oralis is off the hook.

294
00:15:39,620 --> 00:15:41,350
Yeah,
password is perfectly possible.

295
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:44,450
Action results.
So terrible and not just in,

296
00:15:44,780 --> 00:15:46,190
you know,
poor countries.

297
00:15:46,310 --> 00:15:48,680
Uh,
what about people in America?

298
00:15:48,710 --> 00:15:50,030
What about,
um,

299
00:15:50,270 --> 00:15:54,430
people in Britain?
What about people in my country,

300
00:15:54,460 --> 00:15:55,293
Muslim women are now being told,
what are you going to go through a 

301
00:15:57,051 --> 00:15:59,450
course?
What is a free women in a free country,

302
00:16:00,050 --> 00:16:02,110
not second class citizens,
so you don't have to have,

303
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:03,090
uh,
some,

304
00:16:03,210 --> 00:16:04,080
some,
uh,

305
00:16:04,330 --> 00:16:08,020
fear classic legal system saying 
evidence worth half that,

306
00:16:08,280 --> 00:16:11,400
right?
But you as a white guy say that,

307
00:16:11,401 --> 00:16:12,234
then people go bananas and you're 
pushing your views on that even though 

308
00:16:16,021 --> 00:16:19,080
if you're the one that's abiding the 
laws of your country,

309
00:16:19,081 --> 00:16:20,190
which is what they are governed by.

310
00:16:21,060 --> 00:16:23,930
Well now I'm afraid to lose my country 
is slightly worse than that.

311
00:16:24,940 --> 00:16:26,510
You know,
there's a danger.

312
00:16:26,850 --> 00:16:27,683
We're not quite there yet.
We'll have parallel legal system will 

313
00:16:30,571 --> 00:16:33,430
have a say up in civil case,
divorce cases,

314
00:16:34,230 --> 00:16:35,830
big deals.
Uh,

315
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:40,340
I'm a Muslim woman will,
uh,

316
00:16:40,820 --> 00:16:43,970
seems quite content.
Say we can settle this to Shariyah cool,

317
00:16:44,490 --> 00:16:46,380
but this is,
this is kind of racist.

318
00:16:46,381 --> 00:16:49,350
Is it not?
If you say to a woman,

319
00:16:49,380 --> 00:16:53,810
you have to go through a.
you're right.

320
00:16:54,900 --> 00:16:57,810
All liberal opinion across Breslin,
across America,

321
00:16:57,811 --> 00:17:02,360
across the world who go wild sexism.
New social needs is patreo police.

322
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:03,273
Okay.
When that happens to a brown skinned 

323
00:17:04,051 --> 00:17:05,230
woman,
yeah.

324
00:17:05,310 --> 00:17:09,720
Were you in the name of liberalism?
We all,

325
00:17:09,721 --> 00:17:13,590
we all create shaking the uh,
the classic double standards of,

326
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:15,840
of predictable days.
You know,

327
00:17:15,900 --> 00:17:18,630
a white people have more rights and 
white.

328
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:20,280
Certain people are more honest and brown
skinned people.

329
00:17:21,710 --> 00:17:26,710
Kristen issue for how people are treated
in Saudi Arabia or Iran or,

330
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:28,350
or,
or,

331
00:17:28,351 --> 00:17:30,690
uh,
any other country with a uh,

332
00:17:30,770 --> 00:17:32,620
um,
an for me,

333
00:17:32,621 --> 00:17:35,580
I would say a unfair,
classic legal system.

334
00:17:35,910 --> 00:17:38,260
It's here now.
I'm already societies.

335
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:39,473
It does seem to be the liberal soul to 
decide what type of liberalism they 

336
00:17:42,241 --> 00:17:43,074
believe in July,
I believe in liberalism means we've got 

337
00:17:45,151 --> 00:17:48,840
equal rights and universal values or 
does liberalism main.

338
00:17:49,410 --> 00:17:52,860
There's one law for one group and one 
law for another group depending on their

339
00:17:52,861 --> 00:17:53,694
couch.

340
00:17:53,810 --> 00:17:57,320
Does this part of this seem to you that 
it's just the end game?

341
00:17:57,321 --> 00:18:00,440
This is the end result of identity 
politics.

342
00:18:00,580 --> 00:18:01,413
We're,
we're going through right now in 

343
00:18:01,941 --> 00:18:02,774
America,
this really strong phase with identity 

344
00:18:04,461 --> 00:18:07,080
politics.
What?

345
00:18:07,090 --> 00:18:07,923
Right.
So we're all divided on sexuality and 

346
00:18:10,481 --> 00:18:11,314
race and just every,
anything that you can divide people on 

347
00:18:14,321 --> 00:18:15,154
were divided on it right now and is part
of this just that you saw the end game 

348
00:18:19,721 --> 00:18:21,400
of all of this sorta before we did

349
00:18:23,700 --> 00:18:28,700
your profit,
profit bibles or any of that.

350
00:18:31,650 --> 00:18:35,120
To me,
there is a big,

351
00:18:35,121 --> 00:18:35,954
big vacuum.
Opens up at the end of the 20th century 

352
00:18:38,331 --> 00:18:40,580
were first of all,
as I said before,

353
00:18:40,670 --> 00:18:45,500
it may not be so much in America,
in Europe and the love of the world,

354
00:18:45,501 --> 00:18:46,334
the collapse of socialism,
the collapse in the belief of off the 

355
00:18:49,971 --> 00:18:54,030
plan to call me of national society,
but all the sudden the clap,

356
00:18:54,031 --> 00:18:54,864
so it kind of lung collapse,
but a marginalizing and flip real 

357
00:18:57,580 --> 00:18:59,980
optimism,
liberal locksmiths and just says,

358
00:19:00,010 --> 00:19:02,030
look,
there were universal human rights.

359
00:19:02,290 --> 00:19:03,960
It doesn't matter what your skin color 
is,

360
00:19:04,090 --> 00:19:05,930
you know,
it doesn't matter what your religion is.

361
00:19:06,410 --> 00:19:08,870
You can't say,
oh,

362
00:19:08,871 --> 00:19:12,670
it's my culture to oppress women.
You can't say that I was laughing.

363
00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:15,830
You actually now like they laugh with 
you and that's allowed.

364
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:18,560
It's identity politics,
which sounds fun.

365
00:19:18,790 --> 00:19:19,310
Sounds Fun.

366
00:19:19,310 --> 00:19:20,143
You know,
I ain't going to last,

367
00:19:20,220 --> 00:19:23,210
you know,
I read these reports of black students.

368
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:24,193
So again,
when you think about history of a black 

369
00:19:27,051 --> 00:19:29,390
oppression in America and you can 
understand them,

370
00:19:29,391 --> 00:19:34,310
nesting is kid's sake a bit nuts by 
identity politics has and you think,

371
00:19:34,311 --> 00:19:35,144
well,
you know,

372
00:19:35,750 --> 00:19:36,930
let them have their,
uh,

373
00:19:37,060 --> 00:19:40,720
that fuss by identity.
Politics has a hugely dog.

374
00:19:40,750 --> 00:19:41,583
So [inaudible] you have no onset.
We're in the people who say we're the 

375
00:19:45,170 --> 00:19:46,490
masters,
we are against identity.

376
00:19:47,030 --> 00:19:47,863
We all the community leaders,
we all the mothers will a rabbi's 

377
00:19:50,420 --> 00:19:53,180
priests.
We control this group,

378
00:19:53,210 --> 00:19:58,210
this block and we say you were a part of
our group or block or community and uh,

379
00:19:59,990 --> 00:20:00,823
we,
we say that you didn't have the same 

380
00:20:02,311 --> 00:20:03,260
bright.
So it's a,

381
00:20:03,470 --> 00:20:05,810
you know,
a white Anglo Saxon woman at Yale.

382
00:20:06,230 --> 00:20:09,770
We say the constitution,
the bill of rights doesn't apply to you.

383
00:20:09,890 --> 00:20:10,723
It's against your culture.
And that hasn't been thought through at 

384
00:20:13,401 --> 00:20:13,760
all.

385
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:15,540
Right?
So we split people into,

386
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:16,433
into these little boxes.
But then what we ended up carrying the 

387
00:20:18,261 --> 00:20:22,760
least about is the people that are in 
the smaller boxes within those boxes.

388
00:20:22,780 --> 00:20:25,350
Well,
as monitoring the wall set,

389
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:28,560
so you mentioned doing it view has this 
little phrase,

390
00:20:28,561 --> 00:20:30,350
what about minorities?
We remind ourselves,

391
00:20:30,830 --> 00:20:31,663
you know,
what about what about liberals and this 

392
00:20:33,950 --> 00:20:36,070
is thinkers,
the blast females,

393
00:20:36,370 --> 00:20:37,540
the women,
the gay.

394
00:20:37,541 --> 00:20:39,220
So people who say,
what the hell,

395
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:42,370
what the hell?
I am not this group.

396
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:46,600
I'm not a Muslim or a Jew or whatever.
I'm American.

397
00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:48,480
Right?
That to me is the

398
00:20:48,550 --> 00:20:49,383
ultimate irony here is that the spectrum
of people that I've brought on the show 

399
00:20:52,151 --> 00:20:54,850
in that now I've connected with on 
twitter or wherever it is,

400
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:55,953
is I'm not judging any of these people 
based on their color or their religion 

401
00:20:59,591 --> 00:21:03,010
or their ethnicity.
I'm basing it on their ideas,

402
00:21:03,011 --> 00:21:05,230
which is,
which is the most liberal idea.

403
00:21:05,790 --> 00:21:06,910
Yeah.
Well,

404
00:21:07,340 --> 00:21:09,700
you're actually treating them as 
individuals because they're very,

405
00:21:09,701 --> 00:21:10,960
very different.
Uh,

406
00:21:11,290 --> 00:21:16,290
a golf help you.
The only problem of identity politics is

407
00:21:18,940 --> 00:21:20,910
when you stop preaching to people as 
individuals.

408
00:21:21,130 --> 00:21:23,720
You kind of identity politics is,
is,

409
00:21:23,750 --> 00:21:24,411
is,
is,

410
00:21:24,411 --> 00:21:25,850
uh,
is a,

411
00:21:25,930 --> 00:21:26,763
is a slippery,
treacherous conjunction is you can only 

412
00:21:30,701 --> 00:21:32,440
have like,
or you can have politics.

413
00:21:33,430 --> 00:21:36,970
Politics means you don't just look at 
people and say,

414
00:21:36,971 --> 00:21:39,190
there's a block in this instance,
what we're talking about,

415
00:21:39,220 --> 00:21:40,053
the Muslims,
what do you mean there's a group called 

416
00:21:42,580 --> 00:21:43,413
the Muslims because when do you say that
you normally end up handing over the 

417
00:21:47,771 --> 00:21:48,604
right to speak to these Muslims who have
asked your permission to the most 

418
00:21:52,701 --> 00:21:54,000
reactionary people in it.

419
00:21:54,010 --> 00:21:58,000
The people who who,
who wants to enforce a communal identity

420
00:21:58,270 --> 00:22:00,580
and want to enforce it.
First of all,

421
00:22:00,820 --> 00:22:01,653
you know,
I know there's all this paranoia going 

422
00:22:03,011 --> 00:22:06,460
round after the Paris attacks and those 
awful events in California,

423
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:07,473
but yeah,
first and foremost want to enforce on 

424
00:22:11,110 --> 00:22:13,830
Barrow,
unkind on their tribe in fourth or fifth

425
00:22:13,831 --> 00:22:18,420
of booze on them to keep them down.
And the worst part of it is,

426
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:21,370
I think we've been particularly bad in 
Britain and America because we have this

427
00:22:22,150 --> 00:22:26,530
identity politics.
Multicultural problem you've had is,

428
00:22:26,910 --> 00:22:28,140
well,
you know what?

429
00:22:28,141 --> 00:22:30,430
I'm about the men and the women who say,
I'm the second.

430
00:22:30,431 --> 00:22:31,264
This guy said,
the community leader doesn't represent 

431
00:22:33,190 --> 00:22:34,023
me.
I've never voted for him and agree with 

432
00:22:35,681 --> 00:22:36,514
him.
What about this man who says he's a 

433
00:22:38,471 --> 00:22:40,210
priest?
The rabbi and Lula,

434
00:22:40,840 --> 00:22:41,673
I can't believe in all this crap or I'd 
be partially believe in it or I believe 

435
00:22:44,891 --> 00:22:47,170
in bits to this,
but you,

436
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:51,350
you then stopped treating me as if this 
guy and this meeting is,

437
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:55,120
this group owns me without my permission
that that's his.

438
00:22:55,150 --> 00:23:00,150
That's his huge weakness today.
It's well an awful lot.

439
00:23:01,121 --> 00:23:03,430
Before we go onto great question,
so with the sound,

440
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:05,230
with your right,
with Syria,

441
00:23:05,470 --> 00:23:06,303
you know,
what are you going to do about Islamic 

442
00:23:07,361 --> 00:23:10,470
state is where everyday cruelty happens 
in also song.

443
00:23:10,471 --> 00:23:11,304
That's it.
It's where men and women who need a 

444
00:23:15,820 --> 00:23:19,520
confident liberalism and liberalism 
beliefs in human rights,

445
00:23:19,560 --> 00:23:20,393
liberalism that says,
well actually we're not going to say 

446
00:23:23,711 --> 00:23:24,544
that.
What matters first and foremost about 

447
00:23:26,171 --> 00:23:27,004
you is your color or creed.
They need them to help them and they 

448
00:23:29,891 --> 00:23:30,724
turned around to the very people who 
will be able to help them and they're 

449
00:23:32,951 --> 00:23:33,970
not there.
In fact,

450
00:23:33,971 --> 00:23:34,804
they're on the other side.

451
00:23:34,890 --> 00:23:36,180
In fact,
they're on the other side.

452
00:23:36,181 --> 00:23:37,014
That's,
that's the key piece because it's not 

453
00:23:38,071 --> 00:23:38,904
just that it's there.
They're actually working to stop the 

454
00:23:41,161 --> 00:23:44,460
reformers and by calling everyone racist
and all of this stuff,

455
00:23:44,461 --> 00:23:45,294
and then you know what we have going on 
very much so in America right now is 

456
00:23:48,711 --> 00:23:49,544
that Donald trump just this week says,
we're going to close the borders to all 

457
00:23:52,821 --> 00:23:53,481
Muslims.
Well,

458
00:23:53,481 --> 00:23:56,570
now he throws red meat to the right.
He gets.

459
00:23:56,571 --> 00:24:01,100
He probably does more good work for isis
recruiting that he could possibly do,

460
00:24:01,340 --> 00:24:04,850
but unfortunately he's been strengthened
by by a week left.

461
00:24:04,851 --> 00:24:09,050
You talk a lot about that actually,
about how they the this far left group.

462
00:24:09,051 --> 00:24:12,380
Now what we're calling the regressives 
ultimately end up strengthening a lot of

463
00:24:12,381 --> 00:24:13,820
ideas that they should be against.

464
00:24:14,370 --> 00:24:15,203
That's what we're seeing with trump.
I was amazing today in which is where I 

465
00:24:21,981 --> 00:24:25,840
work and I loved the place and here's 
Britain's leading left,

466
00:24:25,841 --> 00:24:30,140
the newspaper and people in your 
questions about Donald Trump.

467
00:24:30,520 --> 00:24:31,353
That first questions were know and you 
could see perhaps I'm reading too much 

468
00:24:37,011 --> 00:24:42,011
into the audience members and such,
but Donald Trump was stopping her.

469
00:24:43,070 --> 00:24:46,940
She taking on reaction.
Whereas in,

470
00:24:47,240 --> 00:24:48,660
you know,
all on years,

471
00:24:48,710 --> 00:24:51,440
on years besides so you,
you've gone.

472
00:24:52,580 --> 00:24:54,290
It's very hard to,
uh,

473
00:24:55,310 --> 00:24:59,030
to get the notion that there are two 
extreme rights,

474
00:24:59,850 --> 00:25:00,683
there is the extreme right,
and I wouldn't until a few weeks ago 

475
00:25:04,461 --> 00:25:05,294
said Donald Trump was on it.
It seems to be heading that way now and 

476
00:25:10,100 --> 00:25:12,020
there is the religious extreme,
right,

477
00:25:12,510 --> 00:25:13,343
extreme,
right,

478
00:25:13,590 --> 00:25:14,423
uh,
and you need to find them both for the 

479
00:25:17,751 --> 00:25:20,990
same reasons and with the same 
arguments.

480
00:25:21,430 --> 00:25:24,080
She's very different.
People seem to find that very,

481
00:25:24,081 --> 00:25:24,914
very difficult to do.
Strikes me as the only principal 

482
00:25:26,271 --> 00:25:27,104
position,
but I imagined if I walked onto any 

483
00:25:28,670 --> 00:25:31,220
campus in America and said that there'll
be no platform,

484
00:25:31,740 --> 00:25:34,440
not only would there be no platform,
but they'd be trigger warning.

485
00:25:34,441 --> 00:25:35,274
Do they go into a safe space?
All the other stuff we're talking about 

486
00:25:37,391 --> 00:25:38,224
it.
And then

487
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:39,560
was so frightening.

488
00:25:40,920 --> 00:25:41,753
Right?
I've had several guests that I didn't 

489
00:25:42,571 --> 00:25:43,404
think were that frightening,
that for some reason have to have 

490
00:25:45,630 --> 00:25:49,050
trigger warnings issued before they 
speak on campuses.

491
00:25:49,260 --> 00:25:50,093
So a look,
a lot of this is happening in Europe 

492
00:25:52,711 --> 00:25:54,570
first,
which is another reason that I'm talking

493
00:25:54,571 --> 00:25:55,404
about it so much because I don't want it
to take hold here the way it has taken 

494
00:25:58,681 --> 00:25:59,514
hold in Europe.
What do you make of the far right 

495
00:26:01,111 --> 00:26:03,210
parties that are now winning across 
Europe?

496
00:26:03,211 --> 00:26:04,260
Right?
Marine Le Pen.

497
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:05,810
Just one in France.
We're in.

498
00:26:05,820 --> 00:26:08,550
I now see that in Denmark and in Sweden 
far right.

499
00:26:08,680 --> 00:26:11,190
Parties are leading in polls for the 
first time ever.

500
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:12,580
Belgium.
Uh,

501
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:16,380
so this thing seems to be miss 
metastasizing,

502
00:26:16,530 --> 00:26:17,580
uh,
right in front of our eyes.

503
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:21,260
Yeah,
there are reasons for that day.

504
00:26:21,790 --> 00:26:25,970
I mean the European Union.
It's not like USA.

505
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:30,680
You're trying to beeline the USA without
the common culture,

506
00:26:30,690 --> 00:26:34,910
common institutions.
And as I'm fond of pointing out to a,

507
00:26:34,970 --> 00:26:37,510
uh,
a in new world to be like the US.

508
00:26:37,511 --> 00:26:38,310
So I said,
well,

509
00:26:38,310 --> 00:26:42,180
USA had one hell of a civil war before 
it became the USA Today.

510
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:43,680
I mean,
do you want,

511
00:26:43,681 --> 00:26:45,960
do you want that?
There are other reasons.

512
00:26:46,180 --> 00:26:47,940
A,
there's two things I want to say.

513
00:26:47,941 --> 00:26:51,720
One you might quite like the other than 
think you might quite like is,

514
00:26:52,070 --> 00:26:56,900
is we seem to agree on this.
It says you can't run around the streets

515
00:26:56,901 --> 00:26:59,640
in your head off A.
Yeah.

516
00:26:59,670 --> 00:27:00,503
Having trigger warnings and safe spaces 
where I'd know a celebrity or a 

517
00:27:03,511 --> 00:27:04,344
politician makes a slightly off color 
remark about homosexuals or women who's 

518
00:27:09,140 --> 00:27:09,973
like sexist remark about women and 
having reading the news and a couple of 

519
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:15,340
times,
um,

520
00:27:15,790 --> 00:27:17,080
uh,
needing,

521
00:27:17,160 --> 00:27:21,420
needing a culture to calm themselves 
down afterwards and then,

522
00:27:21,690 --> 00:27:26,690
and then ignore religious homophobia,
including beverly religious,

523
00:27:28,781 --> 00:27:31,110
Saturday,
February among ethnic minorities.

524
00:27:31,310 --> 00:27:32,143
You can't do that without paying a price
because I think people aren't watching 

525
00:27:36,931 --> 00:27:38,200
you,
you know,

526
00:27:38,380 --> 00:27:42,540
don't think the rest of society had lots
of political writing on the left as well

527
00:27:42,541 --> 00:27:44,790
as the right.
It's like it's a private club,

528
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:47,400
you know,
it's talk to themselves,

529
00:27:47,401 --> 00:27:49,020
but yeah,
the right watches,

530
00:27:49,050 --> 00:27:50,550
Fox News,
sort of less walk.

531
00:27:50,560 --> 00:27:52,020
She's Gong Stewart,
you know,

532
00:27:52,050 --> 00:27:54,990
they just talk themselves.
So it's like a private club and everyone

533
00:27:54,991 --> 00:27:57,160
understands the rules and they forget 
the sound side.

534
00:27:57,161 --> 00:27:59,280
It's a watchman and get outside and are 
say,

535
00:27:59,460 --> 00:28:00,980
you bloody hypocrites.
You,

536
00:28:01,560 --> 00:28:02,880
you,
you will,

537
00:28:02,970 --> 00:28:03,803
you will have one rule for white people 
and another rule for the rest and you 

538
00:28:07,980 --> 00:28:10,780
will not stand up to get back.
And as principal,

539
00:28:10,781 --> 00:28:12,840
so there is that,
that does matter.

540
00:28:13,620 --> 00:28:16,200
A political correctness in Britain has 
become,

541
00:28:16,710 --> 00:28:17,543
has become this kind of swear words and 
it doesn't mean stuff that you would 

542
00:28:20,761 --> 00:28:21,300
understand.

543
00:28:21,300 --> 00:28:23,940
My political rights means deep,
deep,

544
00:28:23,941 --> 00:28:26,760
deep hypocrisy.
Ms Dot government too.

545
00:28:26,770 --> 00:28:28,320
Government.
So that's all true.

546
00:28:28,321 --> 00:28:29,154
You can blame the left only on hands.
You know people about how bad am I 

547
00:28:33,781 --> 00:28:37,170
allowed to swear on your progress?
Where away bring it people who voted for

548
00:28:37,171 --> 00:28:38,970
Donald Trump.
There has to come a point where you just

549
00:28:38,971 --> 00:28:39,361
say,
well,

550
00:28:39,361 --> 00:28:42,330
fuck off.
If you're voting for Donald Trump,

551
00:28:42,380 --> 00:28:44,730
you have a greater pet.
We moved Sean.

552
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:45,713
We will not,
we will not give up on you with your 

553
00:28:47,851 --> 00:28:51,220
fellow citizens.
But there comes a point where you said,

554
00:28:51,230 --> 00:28:52,063
well,
to hell with you,

555
00:28:52,280 --> 00:28:53,950
you know,
you are peddling.

556
00:28:54,750 --> 00:28:56,270
The difficulty is,
and is.

557
00:28:56,310 --> 00:28:57,750
It does come.
I can't.

558
00:28:57,751 --> 00:29:02,751
If you're very confused about this,
we've now go the worst type of,

559
00:29:03,570 --> 00:29:06,290
uh,
of leftist leading or opposition parties

560
00:29:06,300 --> 00:29:11,300
later who's like a caricature.
If I had to write an example of,

561
00:29:13,350 --> 00:29:15,450
of the worst of the leftists and 
Britain,

562
00:29:15,540 --> 00:29:17,070
Jeremy Corbyn,
Jeremy,

563
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:18,620
Jeremy,
yeah.

564
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:21,120
The only good thing about them becoming 
a believer,

565
00:29:21,121 --> 00:29:23,830
his books I wrote are now selling like 
hotcakes,

566
00:29:23,990 --> 00:29:28,080
but I mean by selfish point of view of 
science is,

567
00:29:28,170 --> 00:29:29,003
is you've got a terrible rights in 
America with trump in France who's 

568
00:29:34,710 --> 00:29:39,710
national front in Sweden and Denmark and
all these places a pendulum and,

569
00:29:40,280 --> 00:29:41,113
and he's popping all over your,
no interest because immigration 

570
00:29:43,420 --> 00:29:44,380
integration,
Paul,

571
00:29:44,670 --> 00:29:45,503
because the European,
a single currency as being one of the 

572
00:29:48,580 --> 00:29:51,070
greatest economic mistakes.
Um,

573
00:29:51,970 --> 00:29:56,540
and then you go left in a space where a 
principal should be certainly embracing.

574
00:29:56,710 --> 00:29:59,500
You've got this kind of geographical,
a good girl.

575
00:29:59,501 --> 00:30:00,334
I'm with,
um,

576
00:30:00,500 --> 00:30:02,350
uh,
any organization,

577
00:30:02,410 --> 00:30:06,010
how as a fascistic uh,
as long as it sound.

578
00:30:06,280 --> 00:30:07,113
So you didn't who?
Lots of people who are feeling a bit 

579
00:30:08,371 --> 00:30:10,360
political politically homeless over 
here.

580
00:30:10,550 --> 00:30:12,880
Yeah.
Does it all feel like a perfect storm to

581
00:30:12,881 --> 00:30:14,290
you?
What's going on right now,

582
00:30:14,291 --> 00:30:16,240
and again this,
this is the stuff that's after your book

583
00:30:16,241 --> 00:30:17,074
when we talk about the refugees and some
of the economic problems in Europe and 

584
00:30:21,311 --> 00:30:22,030
this,
you know,

585
00:30:22,030 --> 00:30:22,863
dealing with radical Islam.
It was going on while you were writing 

586
00:30:24,641 --> 00:30:25,810
the book obviously,
but it seems,

587
00:30:25,960 --> 00:30:26,793
it seems to me we have like five things 
right now that are all working at the 

588
00:30:29,471 --> 00:30:32,230
same time.
Then you toss in social media,

589
00:30:32,410 --> 00:30:33,243
you toss in that.
We see videos from everywhere now we 

590
00:30:35,471 --> 00:30:37,260
see,
we can see beheadings,

591
00:30:37,270 --> 00:30:39,060
we can see bombing,
you know,

592
00:30:39,100 --> 00:30:39,933
so you can see,
you can see religious violence and you 

593
00:30:41,261 --> 00:30:42,094
can see state violence all the time that
we really have all of this happening at 

594
00:30:45,041 --> 00:30:47,860
once and it's leading to a,
to a very strange place.

595
00:30:50,360 --> 00:30:51,193
I think one thing Dave,
we can say with certainty that whoever 

596
00:30:53,611 --> 00:30:58,611
it was a full of Berlin Wall was the end
of history history.

597
00:31:00,050 --> 00:31:04,480
If over boy was that a stupid thing to 
say and you can't,

598
00:31:04,530 --> 00:31:08,640
you can't.
Let me get back to the point I made.

599
00:31:08,680 --> 00:31:09,513
She was stopped at the weirdness and 
hypocrisy and the awful betrayal of 

600
00:31:14,701 --> 00:31:15,534
people you get on.
People who call themselves the left 

601
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:20,910
comes,
were like,

602
00:31:20,911 --> 00:31:25,911
don't have a socialist alternative you 
like to have in the Soviet Union falls.

603
00:31:28,890 --> 00:31:32,310
Socialism collapses across the world.
No one believes that anymore.

604
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:34,580
And that,
that was fine for awhile.

605
00:31:34,610 --> 00:31:37,280
If I may generalize it a very Glib way,
uh,

606
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:39,600
that was fine for awhile because 
capitalist,

607
00:31:39,601 --> 00:31:42,240
and we'll call it what you will,
seems to be a great success story,

608
00:31:42,870 --> 00:31:43,703
seemed to work.
That's why I it for Carolina was not an 

609
00:31:46,051 --> 00:31:48,490
idiot when he said,
well,

610
00:31:48,510 --> 00:31:49,343
ever since the crash of 2008,
that system of liberal capitalism has 

611
00:31:54,271 --> 00:31:54,660
failed.

612
00:31:54,660 --> 00:31:58,020
And that's why you've got this feeling 
of perfect storm.

613
00:31:58,170 --> 00:31:59,660
Too many things coming,
as I said,

614
00:31:59,670 --> 00:32:00,503
what is it is not entirely.
There's a wonderful phrase by the 

615
00:32:05,940 --> 00:32:08,040
Italian socialists,
Antonio Gramsci,

616
00:32:08,470 --> 00:32:09,303
you own despair.
The new cannot be born in that 

617
00:32:11,251 --> 00:32:12,690
interregnum.
Many strange,

618
00:32:12,780 --> 00:32:13,613
strange forms will appear.
It seems like that we don't know what 

619
00:32:16,561 --> 00:32:19,020
comes next.
We're not sure of what we've got.

620
00:32:19,021 --> 00:32:20,970
We're not sure it works anymore.
I'm not sure it works,

621
00:32:20,971 --> 00:32:23,070
so yeah,
or Ms Dot middle class America.

622
00:32:23,280 --> 00:32:24,113
Americans watching your program have 
their payers and going after the super 

623
00:32:28,141 --> 00:32:31,380
rich are getting richer.
The American dream doesn't seem to quite

624
00:32:31,381 --> 00:32:33,720
work anymore.
Even with it with a bomber.

625
00:32:33,960 --> 00:32:35,670
Listen,
not quite clear where.

626
00:32:35,740 --> 00:32:40,410
Where are the old challenges for that?
Aren't you get these strange boredom's a

627
00:32:40,490 --> 00:32:44,420
free case forms,
which is when I wrote about cork.

628
00:32:44,470 --> 00:32:45,261
Yeah.
As I said,

629
00:32:45,261 --> 00:32:46,970
people just kept saying for your neck,
neck,

630
00:32:46,971 --> 00:32:49,230
neck that suggest they suggest on the 
friendlies.

631
00:32:49,250 --> 00:32:50,750
Well now it's on the main screen.

632
00:32:50,850 --> 00:32:51,683
Going to that point.
What about some of the tactics these 

633
00:32:54,151 --> 00:32:56,700
guys use and I want to talk a little bit
about Chomsky,

634
00:32:56,701 --> 00:32:59,250
but first we can talk just sort of in 
the more broader sense.

635
00:32:59,251 --> 00:33:00,084
When I've seen the way these guys debate
or the way they treat topics and you 

636
00:33:03,331 --> 00:33:03,721
know,
again,

637
00:33:03,721 --> 00:33:04,554
everyone is racist and all that.
They don't seem to mind if they get 

638
00:33:07,231 --> 00:33:08,400
caught in lies.
They don't.

639
00:33:08,430 --> 00:33:09,263
They love just throwing out the bomb and
then we let it spreads like wildfire on 

640
00:33:13,351 --> 00:33:15,810
social media and you know,
there's that famous saying,

641
00:33:15,811 --> 00:33:17,670
you know,
it takes one second to lie,

642
00:33:17,671 --> 00:33:20,220
but it takes a lifetime to get it back 
or whatever.

643
00:33:20,870 --> 00:33:23,280
And it seems that a series of these 
guys,

644
00:33:23,281 --> 00:33:25,640
they love this and I don't know,
look again,

645
00:33:25,680 --> 00:33:28,560
I'm not on the right so I can't really.
I don't like the right.

646
00:33:28,780 --> 00:33:31,530
I've never been part of the right.
So I police them differently,

647
00:33:31,531 --> 00:33:33,000
but I don't want to see this from my 
guys.

648
00:33:33,060 --> 00:33:35,680
So what do you think about just the 
tactics that they're using?

649
00:33:37,250 --> 00:33:40,220
One question to you,
a plain speaking,

650
00:33:40,221 --> 00:33:43,370
open heart.
It doesn't behave.

651
00:33:43,371 --> 00:33:44,940
Any bathroom that people

652
00:33:45,790 --> 00:33:46,930
look,
they don't look,

653
00:33:46,931 --> 00:33:47,231
I'm,
look,

654
00:33:47,231 --> 00:33:48,064
I'm dealing in America with trump right 
this second with over the top bombast 

655
00:33:50,771 --> 00:33:51,450
city.
So,

656
00:33:51,450 --> 00:33:52,283
and again this is why.
Look I'm a guilty liberal in that sense 

657
00:33:54,101 --> 00:33:54,934
that sometimes I feel bad.
I spent so much time on the guys on my 

658
00:33:58,151 --> 00:33:59,710
side and then I'm afraid,
you know,

659
00:33:59,711 --> 00:34:00,544
people ask me all the time,
am I afraid that ultimately this will 

660
00:34:02,981 --> 00:34:05,500
strengthen the right?
But I,

661
00:34:05,530 --> 00:34:08,050
but to me it's like,
if we don't stand up now,

662
00:34:08,080 --> 00:34:11,140
well then the game is over.
We just hand it to the right,

663
00:34:11,230 --> 00:34:12,910
which is what's happening.
I think with trump.

664
00:34:14,430 --> 00:34:15,460
Uh,
well,

665
00:34:15,590 --> 00:34:18,460
um,
there is a long tradition of,

666
00:34:18,490 --> 00:34:20,190
of,
of lying on the left,

667
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:23,230
you know,
if you go back to,

668
00:34:23,250 --> 00:34:24,730
to Stalin,
he,

669
00:34:24,900 --> 00:34:25,733
he golfs gullible people to believe in 
show trials where people confess the 

670
00:34:31,001 --> 00:34:32,980
croc impossible crimes that were 
committed.

671
00:34:33,700 --> 00:34:38,700
So there is bad.
I'm less,

672
00:34:40,030 --> 00:34:43,330
I'm less interested unless concerned 
about left and right.

673
00:34:43,350 --> 00:34:46,740
Then this,
here is something that happens when with

674
00:34:46,750 --> 00:34:48,760
new media,
you know,

675
00:34:48,761 --> 00:34:51,380
have stapes,
uh,

676
00:34:51,510 --> 00:34:53,830
here for two years,
I think is a pretty bad thing.

677
00:34:54,030 --> 00:34:54,863
Uh,
I think his main audience seems to be 

678
00:34:57,050 --> 00:34:57,883
little girl,
and this could be reusing material to 

679
00:34:59,240 --> 00:35:00,420
write,
but you know,

680
00:35:00,510 --> 00:35:01,200
uh,
it's,

681
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:02,290
you know,
it's a bad day.

682
00:35:02,291 --> 00:35:03,880
You've got nothing to do.
You got no ideas.

683
00:35:03,881 --> 00:35:06,470
I know I'll turn on Fox News is,
is we're pretty lucky.

684
00:35:06,700 --> 00:35:07,533
You've now got states,
Russia and Iran most notionally 

685
00:35:12,370 --> 00:35:17,370
producing propagate the gamble.
So beggar cater to pushing whole truth,

686
00:35:18,680 --> 00:35:21,010
conspiracy theories,
lies,

687
00:35:21,300 --> 00:35:24,100
you know,
gets shot down over Ukraine.

688
00:35:24,390 --> 00:35:28,930
There's television channels in English 
who are pumping stuff out.

689
00:35:29,210 --> 00:35:33,280
So you were around as wants,
if you're on the left in America,

690
00:35:34,090 --> 00:35:37,380
you just have to go on and on about 
something.

691
00:35:37,381 --> 00:35:38,214
Nixon was posting downs or something in 
the Wall Street Journal reading 

692
00:35:40,230 --> 00:35:43,830
something on Fox News.
And if you're only in America,

693
00:35:43,831 --> 00:35:45,900
you were complaining about New York 
Times,

694
00:35:46,230 --> 00:35:48,510
you know,
deliberately covering something up.

695
00:35:48,750 --> 00:35:51,990
Now you suddenly go whole states,
uh,

696
00:35:52,080 --> 00:35:52,913
with their secret services at foreign 
offices that propaganda arms behind him 

697
00:35:57,450 --> 00:35:58,283
pumping material include west,
which is instantly taken up by both the 

698
00:36:02,761 --> 00:36:03,594
far left on the roads case.
It's very difficult certainly in 

699
00:36:07,441 --> 00:36:08,370
Britain.
So as I say,

700
00:36:08,371 --> 00:36:11,880
things have gotten much much earlier 
than they have in America is very,

701
00:36:11,881 --> 00:36:15,230
very difficult to tell her.
Um,

702
00:36:15,360 --> 00:36:17,360
uh,
uh,

703
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:19,590
the people who support boosting,
for instance,

704
00:36:19,591 --> 00:36:23,490
in Russia today,
you've got marine Le Pen doing it.

705
00:36:23,730 --> 00:36:25,920
Who is the lead for French far right 
party.

706
00:36:25,950 --> 00:36:26,783
You Got Galloway gallaway who's just 
screening as combination of left 

707
00:36:29,491 --> 00:36:30,640
business.
And Mr Griffin,

708
00:36:30,950 --> 00:36:31,783
I mean,
and so you've got a kind of merger of 

709
00:36:35,461 --> 00:36:36,294
the extremes against liberal democracy 
and they're both equally Kim Kardashian 

710
00:36:39,930 --> 00:36:44,930
that both equally sinful nature raw.
What matters to the most is,

711
00:36:47,480 --> 00:36:49,560
is building conspiratorial narrative.

712
00:36:49,660 --> 00:36:50,493
So in a lot of ways we really could 
blame sort of mainstream media for this 

713
00:36:53,711 --> 00:36:54,550
craziness,
right?

714
00:36:54,551 --> 00:36:56,530
Because it seems to me that for a long 
time,

715
00:36:56,800 --> 00:36:57,633
mainstream media,
which had no competition before the 

716
00:36:59,231 --> 00:37:00,064
digital age,
they did such a poor job that then they 

717
00:37:03,071 --> 00:37:03,904
handed everything over to the digital 
side and I think for awhile the online 

718
00:37:06,761 --> 00:37:11,440
media for the first few years of it,
I think they did do a really nice job in

719
00:37:11,441 --> 00:37:15,670
breaking stories and getting out 
information that you wouldn't,

720
00:37:15,730 --> 00:37:18,580
that you wouldn't get otherwise.
And now it seems like the gloves are off

721
00:37:18,581 --> 00:37:19,660
and now it's,
anything's true.

722
00:37:19,690 --> 00:37:20,530
Nobody knows who to trust.

723
00:37:20,580 --> 00:37:21,580
Yeah.
Um,

724
00:37:22,060 --> 00:37:22,893
yeah.
But there's a lot of truth now except 

725
00:37:24,780 --> 00:37:27,330
some kind of binary division between new
major in Obj.

726
00:37:27,360 --> 00:37:31,710
It's good journalists and it's a 
problem.

727
00:37:31,711 --> 00:37:32,544
Dave,
if you are me to go and observe a or a 

728
00:37:37,710 --> 00:37:39,360
on the time,
do you,

729
00:37:39,370 --> 00:37:40,203
you're talking reports on the La Times a
and something that you've done a 

730
00:37:43,381 --> 00:37:46,050
terrible job of.
You're allowing all these,

731
00:37:46,120 --> 00:37:49,890
a crank.
These fruitcakes sees a Flim,

732
00:37:49,891 --> 00:37:53,580
flam merchants from all over the world 
or to walk all over you.

733
00:37:53,960 --> 00:37:56,550
The man or woman the La Times was,
it looked like,

734
00:37:57,280 --> 00:37:58,860
oh,
business models collapsed.

735
00:37:59,740 --> 00:38:00,573
You know,
we're trying to staff your rows and in 

736
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:06,630
Peking and Beijing and you know,
give me a break.

737
00:38:06,660 --> 00:38:07,290
Yeah,
we can.

738
00:38:07,290 --> 00:38:09,640
We can.
We can barely get a report or you know,

739
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:10,890
up the road,
San Francisco,

740
00:38:13,110 --> 00:38:16,680
the business model for if you like 
serious,

741
00:38:16,780 --> 00:38:20,700
a serious farmer,
as good as it is,

742
00:38:20,701 --> 00:38:22,470
getting harder and harder,
sustainable.

743
00:38:23,090 --> 00:38:23,923
Surely La Times and newspapers and 
across America are to my knowledge from 

744
00:38:28,890 --> 00:38:32,430
having met him and we work on them.
I'll to try and keep it going.

745
00:38:32,431 --> 00:38:35,070
But Indian,
the lack of money talks,

746
00:38:35,260 --> 00:38:36,093
money talks.
That's the silence that comes from the 

747
00:38:38,181 --> 00:38:40,410
lack of money is a silence between.
Yes,

748
00:38:40,540 --> 00:38:41,470
yes.
This debate,

749
00:38:41,620 --> 00:38:42,453
so the gap is being filled and what 
worries me is it's not people talking 

750
00:38:47,381 --> 00:38:48,214
rubbish or people talking drivel is they
always have is where are you going to 

751
00:38:54,131 --> 00:38:58,430
get the reliable report?
So what is happening in Peking,

752
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:00,033
Beijing?
Where are you going to get the reliable 

753
00:39:01,420 --> 00:39:02,253
pull reports on how coaching is 
manipulating a European opinion that's 

754
00:39:08,081 --> 00:39:09,490
getting harder and harder to.

755
00:39:09,630 --> 00:39:10,141
Okay.
Well,

756
00:39:10,141 --> 00:39:10,974
as it,
as someone that I consider an expert in 

757
00:39:12,181 --> 00:39:14,190
this space,
how do you decide who to trust?

758
00:39:14,191 --> 00:39:15,630
I,
I really don't know anymore.

759
00:39:15,631 --> 00:39:16,464
I,
you know,

760
00:39:16,530 --> 00:39:18,330
I follow a lot of different 
organizations,

761
00:39:18,331 --> 00:39:19,350
right?
Left middle,

762
00:39:19,790 --> 00:39:20,623
know as reputable and some off the deep 
end and I try to pilfer out some 

763
00:39:24,031 --> 00:39:24,864
knowledge and some truth and I try not 
to only follow things that reinforce my 

764
00:39:29,011 --> 00:39:29,844
beliefs,
which is another huge problem with 

765
00:39:30,930 --> 00:39:34,170
social media has given us.
But how do you decide who to trust?

766
00:39:34,850 --> 00:39:35,683
Well,
you probably got accused me of being 

767
00:39:37,780 --> 00:39:38,613
horribly old fashioned stuff,
but I mean there are student 

768
00:39:40,120 --> 00:39:41,740
organizations I trust,
you know,

769
00:39:42,230 --> 00:39:45,450
um,
I still trusted off trying to newspapers

770
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,160
and Alexis because I know there's a 
very,

771
00:39:48,161 --> 00:39:48,994
very strong editing process there and 
it's opinion pages are sap for us and 

772
00:39:52,421 --> 00:39:53,254
what have you.
Now that may changes as the business 

773
00:39:55,331 --> 00:39:57,310
model for journalism goes down,
but I still don't.

774
00:39:57,470 --> 00:39:57,810
Well,
look,

775
00:39:57,810 --> 00:40:00,790
they had an op Ed on the front page for 
the first time in [inaudible] 95 years.

776
00:40:00,810 --> 00:40:03,180
Just disgraceful.
Disgraceful.

777
00:40:03,580 --> 00:40:04,740
Yeah.
Let's go around the wheels,

778
00:40:04,741 --> 00:40:08,520
go round and have a dinner.
So we don't want your bloody opinions.

779
00:40:08,521 --> 00:40:10,170
We also say,
give us some news.

780
00:40:10,310 --> 00:40:13,030
I've read a paper that had that on the,
on the front of.

781
00:40:13,100 --> 00:40:13,541
All right,
so let,

782
00:40:13,541 --> 00:40:14,374
let's back up for a second.
Let's talk for a few minutes about Noam 

783
00:40:17,140 --> 00:40:18,610
Chomsky because you talk about him a bit
in the book.

784
00:40:18,611 --> 00:40:21,310
It's not a tremendous amount but you.
But I have a friend,

785
00:40:21,360 --> 00:40:22,193
uh,
who is on what I consider it in this 

786
00:40:24,131 --> 00:40:24,964
regressive group.
And a lot of times we'll be debating 

787
00:40:26,981 --> 00:40:28,910
back and forth about this stuff and 
I'll,

788
00:40:28,930 --> 00:40:29,763
I'll be giving him as much historical 
knowledge as I have and as much factual 

789
00:40:33,161 --> 00:40:33,994
knowledge as I have.
And then he'll sort of always end 

790
00:40:35,711 --> 00:40:37,210
everything by saying,
well,

791
00:40:37,540 --> 00:40:38,373
I don't really know about that,
but I read some Chomsky and I'm just 

792
00:40:40,391 --> 00:40:43,510
kind of giving back to you.
And I think you sort of hit on that also

793
00:40:43,511 --> 00:40:44,344
in the book that there's just this 
belief in this guy that maybe isn't 

794
00:40:48,521 --> 00:40:49,354
fully warranted or he's been.
He's been very good at waving off the 

795
00:40:52,031 --> 00:40:54,400
things that don't quite agree with his 
worldview.

796
00:40:56,820 --> 00:40:59,900
It's interesting for two reasons.
I mean,

797
00:41:00,700 --> 00:41:02,950
he was an old guy.
Come on,

798
00:41:03,650 --> 00:41:04,483
shout them down.
But I mean he's adopted some pretty 

799
00:41:07,111 --> 00:41:12,111
disgraceful positions,
a massive Bosnian Muslims.

800
00:41:13,591 --> 00:41:14,424
And so going along with people who are 
1990 and going along and never missing 

801
00:41:20,121 --> 00:41:23,130
is wrong.
And building this very.

802
00:41:23,131 --> 00:41:25,710
Trump's,
his writing is very poor writing,

803
00:41:25,711 --> 00:41:26,544
so stands for English,
but it builds is very dense web of 

804
00:41:28,861 --> 00:41:30,810
light.
Your friend wants your in your like,

805
00:41:30,830 --> 00:41:32,470
uh,
a fly in the.

806
00:41:32,520 --> 00:41:35,210
Whether it's very to go out,
so that's.

807
00:41:35,780 --> 00:41:39,470
That's kind of a a fishing.
You say in America,

808
00:41:39,620 --> 00:41:44,620
you finished this man.
This is.

809
00:41:45,460 --> 00:41:49,190
This is all from a point of view.
It sort of made up and actually when you

810
00:41:49,191 --> 00:41:51,110
figured out what he's doing is quite 
disgraceful,

811
00:41:51,410 --> 00:41:54,860
but here's why Chomsky was worth 
diversion.

812
00:41:54,950 --> 00:41:55,783
Chapter two is it is what kinds of.
You are young on an American campus and 

813
00:42:02,271 --> 00:42:03,104
you get your.

814
00:42:03,160 --> 00:42:05,450
Can you read all his books and you 
think,

815
00:42:05,451 --> 00:42:10,070
well,
what kind of society are you aiming for?

816
00:42:10,220 --> 00:42:11,053
There is no social vision.
There's nothing that the grasses and 

817
00:42:14,271 --> 00:42:15,104
socialists to run through American 
history from the 18 eighties were 

818
00:42:17,991 --> 00:42:18,940
recognized.
So just say,

819
00:42:18,950 --> 00:42:21,470
this is all just saying Americans,
shit me,

820
00:42:22,120 --> 00:42:23,220
me,
shit,

821
00:42:23,520 --> 00:42:25,370
America.
We probably would never have happened.

822
00:42:25,371 --> 00:42:26,204
The pilgrim files,
we probably have churned down at 

823
00:42:27,230 --> 00:42:30,710
Plymouth Rock and gone back to England.
The whole thing is a disaster.

824
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:33,050
Everything it does is wrong.
The thing is alive and you think,

825
00:42:33,051 --> 00:42:36,260
well actually ridiculous World Vision,
funnily enough.

826
00:42:36,320 --> 00:42:40,790
Here's the thing.
It's really easy to buy into because you

827
00:42:40,791 --> 00:42:44,930
didn't have to commit to anything if the
regressive left.

828
00:42:44,931 --> 00:42:46,250
And so I really liked that phrase,
well,

829
00:42:46,251 --> 00:42:50,840
let's take the regressive left.
Skin left the post socialist left.

830
00:42:51,320 --> 00:42:55,970
On the one hand it has very little to 
say positive and that's,

831
00:42:56,570 --> 00:42:59,090
that's kind of easy for everyone to sign
up to.

832
00:42:59,300 --> 00:43:01,580
You just have to think that Washington 
is a pile of shit.

833
00:43:01,600 --> 00:43:04,000
But I mean Washington DC is a pile of 
shit.

834
00:43:04,060 --> 00:43:08,340
Well that's sure as you know,
the State Department doesn't have,

835
00:43:08,341 --> 00:43:11,630
is doing fine.
The CIO is wicked.

836
00:43:11,870 --> 00:43:12,703
And so instead of having a left wing,
you had to make really positive 

837
00:43:17,901 --> 00:43:19,430
commitments for,
you know,

838
00:43:20,240 --> 00:43:22,690
40 years ago I couldn't have come on 
your program and said,

839
00:43:22,700 --> 00:43:23,770
I'm a socialist,
right?

840
00:43:23,780 --> 00:43:25,000
I'm a socialist.
I.

841
00:43:25,010 --> 00:43:26,500
And you're already said,
oh nick,

842
00:43:26,830 --> 00:43:27,663
he's associate if that sounds good,
we'll go along and I say I wasn't 

843
00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:33,350
massively high taxes or I want to 
nationalize this and that.

844
00:43:33,500 --> 00:43:36,980
And people who would it be an agreement?
We said we'll back off and say,

845
00:43:36,990 --> 00:43:38,390
hell,
I don't want anything to do with this.

846
00:43:39,040 --> 00:43:41,240
You know,
this guy is threatening my Livingston.

847
00:43:41,840 --> 00:43:45,000
Now you just have to say that,
uh,

848
00:43:45,110 --> 00:43:48,170
everything you read is ally,
uh,

849
00:43:48,230 --> 00:43:51,540
your government's evil unless been,
unfortunately,

850
00:43:51,590 --> 00:43:52,423
that's actually because the flaking,
so few positive policy commitments as 

851
00:43:55,580 --> 00:43:56,740
Chomsky does.

852
00:43:57,500 --> 00:43:59,660
It's certainly very easy to go along 
with him.

853
00:43:59,750 --> 00:44:00,583
You know,
I get into the hands of people here in 

854
00:44:02,301 --> 00:44:03,134
London,
which is a very expensive city for the 

855
00:44:05,520 --> 00:44:08,320
rich people I know.
And that books find them Chomsky on the,

856
00:44:08,420 --> 00:44:10,550
on the,
on the,

857
00:44:10,551 --> 00:44:12,440
uh,
on their shelves.

858
00:44:12,740 --> 00:44:14,870
And that's big because funnily enough 
rules,

859
00:44:14,871 --> 00:44:19,871
suppose radicalism that kind of left 
without a positive program with just the

860
00:44:20,091 --> 00:44:22,960
critique is no threat to them.
It's no fretful wealthy.

861
00:44:22,980 --> 00:44:23,813
He's known knowing fractally pamphlets.
They were friendly bankers on Wall 

862
00:44:25,491 --> 00:44:26,810
Street.
You know,

863
00:44:27,140 --> 00:44:27,973
it's something.
Lots of people when they quite 

864
00:44:30,480 --> 00:44:35,480
justifiably often pissed off at 
government or because you know,

865
00:44:36,190 --> 00:44:37,050
they,
they,

866
00:44:37,051 --> 00:44:40,590
they've got a conspiracy theory mind 
though because they will look friendly.

867
00:44:40,680 --> 00:44:45,020
Everyone can sign up to that January 
left wing program is hard.

868
00:44:45,120 --> 00:44:48,630
The genuine left wing program make 
friends and enemies,

869
00:44:49,200 --> 00:44:51,690
but this kind of pseudo life,
this regressive left.

870
00:44:51,780 --> 00:44:52,613
It's terribly easy,
easily even too easy I think for any 

871
00:44:54,841 --> 00:44:56,310
successful political movement.

872
00:44:56,450 --> 00:44:57,283
You know,
it's interesting because I was really 

873
00:44:58,311 --> 00:44:59,144
embedded in it for a couple of years and
I guess I hadn't pieced this all 

874
00:45:01,801 --> 00:45:03,500
together what you're talking about,
but right now,

875
00:45:03,680 --> 00:45:07,340
but part of my frustration was that we 
never talked about solutions.

876
00:45:07,610 --> 00:45:10,100
We always could talk about problems,
right?

877
00:45:10,101 --> 00:45:11,480
It was always,
you know,

878
00:45:11,481 --> 00:45:15,200
the American industrial complex and and 
bombing and race and whatever,

879
00:45:15,350 --> 00:45:18,460
but there were never solution so that,
that does get to what you're saying that

880
00:45:18,461 --> 00:45:19,294
it's

881
00:45:19,340 --> 00:45:20,173
could as soon as you offer solution,
you're going to piss some people off 

882
00:45:23,970 --> 00:45:26,520
because it's an illusion meat and you're
not making a commitment.

883
00:45:26,700 --> 00:45:30,910
And as soon as you make a commitment,
a little Dave Rubin believed this,

884
00:45:30,920 --> 00:45:31,980
well,
it's just wrong.

885
00:45:32,890 --> 00:45:33,723
It's very easy to just say it's all a 
conspiracy it so that way you don't 

886
00:45:40,261 --> 00:45:42,030
expose yourself.
You're not making.

887
00:45:42,060 --> 00:45:42,893
You're not making a poster program and 
sticking your neck out there where you 

888
00:45:45,980 --> 00:45:47,240
sit down.

889
00:45:47,440 --> 00:45:48,273
So speaking of conspiracy theories,
one of the through lines throughout the 

890
00:45:50,651 --> 00:45:51,484
book,
and then you do devote a chapter to it 

891
00:45:52,670 --> 00:45:56,800
in completion,
is that in all of these movements,

892
00:45:56,980 --> 00:45:57,813
somehow blaming the Jews are always.
It always comes around to blaming the 

893
00:46:01,991 --> 00:46:03,730
Jews.
Now the language has changed.

894
00:46:03,731 --> 00:46:05,060
Now it's blaming.
Zionists

895
00:46:05,190 --> 00:46:07,950
blamed.
No one says to us anymore

896
00:46:08,440 --> 00:46:09,251
right now,
right?

897
00:46:09,251 --> 00:46:10,084
It's not,
it's not politically correct to say 

898
00:46:10,991 --> 00:46:11,824
Jews.
So you just say Zionists are you say 

899
00:46:12,671 --> 00:46:13,504
Israel or whatever it is,
but you really did lay out an 

900
00:46:15,191 --> 00:46:16,024
interesting piece in almost every 
example throughout time that they were 

901
00:46:19,571 --> 00:46:21,200
always blame on both sides.
They,

902
00:46:21,280 --> 00:46:22,840
the capitalists would say the Jews are 
socialists.

903
00:46:22,880 --> 00:46:25,870
Socialists would say Jews are 
capitalists and every other which way.

904
00:46:25,871 --> 00:46:26,704
What do you think that is about?
I think you probably just explained it 

905
00:46:28,631 --> 00:46:31,020
with this conspiratorial thing and the 
other.

906
00:46:31,180 --> 00:46:31,811
Yeah.
Well,

907
00:46:31,811 --> 00:46:34,000
look,
here's the problem.

908
00:46:34,480 --> 00:46:39,480
If you genuinely,
you will see I have a person for many,

909
00:46:42,160 --> 00:46:47,160
many folks and I'm sure they'll lesion,
but if you genuinely think that they,

910
00:46:48,460 --> 00:46:52,390
for instance,
secretly blew up the twin towers,

911
00:46:53,610 --> 00:46:54,520
uh,
and then,

912
00:46:54,580 --> 00:46:55,413
uh,
then all kinds of types of play the 

913
00:46:57,550 --> 00:47:02,530
adventures away if you go into a or a 
bomber is replies to the,

914
00:47:02,550 --> 00:47:05,660
as much less.
A borrower isn't to real American.

915
00:47:05,661 --> 00:47:08,050
He's a secret Muslim from Kenya.
You know,

916
00:47:08,410 --> 00:47:09,243
if you can even believe that you have to
believe in extraordinary view of the 

917
00:47:12,791 --> 00:47:17,791
world where a handful of people can fool
the entire population.

918
00:47:19,910 --> 00:47:21,760
The sheep poop.
Well,

919
00:47:22,030 --> 00:47:24,800
while she's thinking about who are those
handful of people historically,

920
00:47:25,160 --> 00:47:28,570
you know,
you started down that road,

921
00:47:28,571 --> 00:47:30,430
you ended up the grades.
Well,

922
00:47:30,500 --> 00:47:32,580
how have you found shocking being called
caring?

923
00:47:34,800 --> 00:47:35,633
Yeah.
And I think some of a liberal American 

924
00:47:39,461 --> 00:47:42,990
Jews will find it shocking because I say
we're five years ahead of you.

925
00:47:43,550 --> 00:47:45,230
Uh,
when it comes and hits her,

926
00:47:45,340 --> 00:47:46,173
is this I how I never expected to find 
out a few sentences perhaps I was being 

927
00:47:54,250 --> 00:47:59,250
like and um,
but it is quite extraordinary,

928
00:48:00,130 --> 00:48:01,630
uh,
the extent of it.

929
00:48:01,870 --> 00:48:04,270
And it's quite extraordinary how it's 
tolerated now,

930
00:48:04,350 --> 00:48:06,640
isn't cooldowns now?

931
00:48:07,250 --> 00:48:08,083
So do you think some of that when,
when I hear people say that the first 

932
00:48:09,921 --> 00:48:10,754
real quick we should mention.
So you just mentioned your last name 

933
00:48:11,871 --> 00:48:13,370
calling.
You're actually not Jewish.

934
00:48:13,371 --> 00:48:14,204
So,

935
00:48:16,300 --> 00:48:17,600
uh,
no.

936
00:48:17,650 --> 00:48:18,100
My,
my,

937
00:48:18,100 --> 00:48:18,933
my,
my family abandoned her religion for 

938
00:48:20,071 --> 00:48:21,230
Regina was system.
So,

939
00:48:21,231 --> 00:48:22,064
you know,
I'm,

940
00:48:22,890 --> 00:48:26,480
I'm going to ask Tommy and his family 
have about 1900 views.

941
00:48:26,481 --> 00:48:28,860
Wouldn't have to pay strict.
And Dave,

942
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:30,520
it's not.
Yeah,

943
00:48:31,020 --> 00:48:33,740
we'll be able to finger cute little said
you were curious.

944
00:48:34,310 --> 00:48:38,240
But here's the problem.
If you look at Anti Semitism,

945
00:48:38,270 --> 00:48:41,020
antisemitism has virtually nothing to do
with you.

946
00:48:41,650 --> 00:48:45,380
Antisemitism became in the late 19th 
century,

947
00:48:45,381 --> 00:48:47,640
early 20th century.
And the Nazis,

948
00:48:48,030 --> 00:48:50,840
it was some way of fighting progress.
It was a way of saying,

949
00:48:50,841 --> 00:48:52,400
look,
you democracy,

950
00:48:52,401 --> 00:48:54,230
human rights,
women's rights,

951
00:48:54,950 --> 00:48:56,730
all these,
you shouldn't believe in them.

952
00:48:57,560 --> 00:48:59,640
They were all praying.
So fraud,

953
00:48:59,650 --> 00:49:00,740
say as a,
uh,

954
00:49:00,830 --> 00:49:02,330
they will,
uh,

955
00:49:02,960 --> 00:49:03,793
behind them is a pipe master,
pulling the strings in that public mass 

956
00:49:06,070 --> 00:49:08,140
with acute.
Um,

957
00:49:08,630 --> 00:49:11,160
so you,
you would afford,

958
00:49:11,240 --> 00:49:12,073
there's a left,
but believes in democracy and human 

959
00:49:13,701 --> 00:49:16,490
rights will be for its own sake because 
maps,

960
00:49:16,491 --> 00:49:21,491
anything else only alert the whole time 
for the dangers of.

961
00:49:23,930 --> 00:49:24,910
But actually,
you know,

962
00:49:24,990 --> 00:49:27,160
going back to trump's aid believes the 
box.

963
00:49:27,340 --> 00:49:30,630
They believe human rights is all full.
They believe it's all live.

964
00:49:30,980 --> 00:49:34,010
So that's one reason why they ended up 
doing or not Chomsky himself,

965
00:49:34,011 --> 00:49:37,940
but that's why people end up there and 
they don't understand what goes with it.

966
00:49:37,970 --> 00:49:42,970
They didn't look at organizations like 
Hezbollah or Iran or and say,

967
00:49:44,421 --> 00:49:45,590
hold on a second,
okay,

968
00:49:46,010 --> 00:49:48,920
they're antisemitic,
but that's just because of Israel.

969
00:49:48,980 --> 00:49:49,830
And then they say,
well,

970
00:49:49,840 --> 00:49:50,330
homesick,
but look,

971
00:49:50,330 --> 00:49:52,700
the way they women look at where they 
treat rules,

972
00:49:52,870 --> 00:49:55,890
look at the way that they just miss 
human rights were dismissed.

973
00:49:55,930 --> 00:50:00,080
Democracy in antisemitism absolutely 
goes along with that.

974
00:50:00,380 --> 00:50:05,050
And once you accept antisemitism,
you have to not just anti racist,

975
00:50:05,060 --> 00:50:07,880
but you have all your progressive 
principles because historically,

976
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:08,833
antisemitism has always been used by 
Oprah reactory movement who again left 

977
00:50:13,010 --> 00:50:13,880
should be against.

978
00:50:14,060 --> 00:50:14,871
Right?
So this,

979
00:50:14,871 --> 00:50:15,704
I always say when it comes to this,
and I was just in Israel last week and 

980
00:50:17,961 --> 00:50:19,810
at the top of the show when I,
when I did my,

981
00:50:20,070 --> 00:50:20,903
my piece,
I was saying how I saw coexistence 

982
00:50:22,911 --> 00:50:24,350
there.
I was in Jerusalem,

983
00:50:24,650 --> 00:50:26,990
you know,
I ate falafel in the Arab quarter,

984
00:50:27,080 --> 00:50:30,860
saw Israeli policemen helping Muslim 
women move a box.

985
00:50:30,861 --> 00:50:33,220
I saw ultra orthodox Jews.
I mean,

986
00:50:33,230 --> 00:50:36,410
that doesn't happen anywhere in the 
Mideast except for Israel.

987
00:50:36,411 --> 00:50:37,244
And of course not to say everything's 
perfect there and there's all sorts of 

988
00:50:40,011 --> 00:50:42,080
political problems,
religious problems and all that,

989
00:50:42,290 --> 00:50:43,123
but that doesn't.
But the only place that has any 

990
00:50:44,421 --> 00:50:46,820
progressive values in the Middle East is
Israel.

991
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:47,833
And they,

992
00:50:51,770 --> 00:50:52,603
uh,
I walked about quarter the boundary on 

993
00:51:01,520 --> 00:51:02,470
the wrong too.
You know,

994
00:51:02,890 --> 00:51:04,180
you say someone says,
well,

995
00:51:04,181 --> 00:51:06,280
as problems on the West Bank,
there's problems in gauze.

996
00:51:06,281 --> 00:51:08,930
And you said what about Syria?
Because actually is quite a good wall.

997
00:51:09,060 --> 00:51:14,060
So that the council was about,
when you think about it,

998
00:51:14,440 --> 00:51:15,340
um,
but you know,

999
00:51:15,400 --> 00:51:18,510
you shouldn't say that doesn't mean that
students shouldn't have to run the state

1000
00:51:18,511 --> 00:51:19,344
and doesn't mean no horrendous problems 
with the Israeli rocked and you 

1001
00:51:22,691 --> 00:51:27,691
shouldn't sort of romanticize Israel.
I'm a asshole.

1002
00:51:28,780 --> 00:51:29,730
Um,
but,

1003
00:51:30,390 --> 00:51:33,700
but yeah,
but here's the thing is the problem.

1004
00:51:33,910 --> 00:51:38,910
The problem is,
is this is great reasons for,

1005
00:51:39,820 --> 00:51:40,653
I would say the liberal liberal 
difficulty understanding radical Islam 

1006
00:51:45,520 --> 00:51:46,353
is.
There's very good liberal impulse to 

1007
00:51:48,860 --> 00:51:51,090
assumes the world is rational.
You know,

1008
00:51:51,250 --> 00:51:55,090
there's the assumes that if there is,
it's terrible.

1009
00:51:55,091 --> 00:51:58,240
Terroristic movement that were blow out 
of the twin towers,

1010
00:51:58,530 --> 00:52:02,560
the woods.
And we knew if they had chemical weapons

1011
00:52:02,561 --> 00:52:05,110
or nuclear weapons against feeling say 
words.

1012
00:52:05,470 --> 00:52:08,760
That must be a root cause for it.
You know,

1013
00:52:09,460 --> 00:52:10,293
that must be some rational explanation 
that we can satisfy that we can operate 

1014
00:52:15,521 --> 00:52:16,354
these evil goals.
I'm thinking they call just be that 

1015
00:52:18,881 --> 00:52:23,260
angry again and stuff is not partly our 
fault.

1016
00:52:23,730 --> 00:52:24,541
Yeah.
I saw,

1017
00:52:24,541 --> 00:52:25,374
I saw a lot of that actually right after
the Paris attacks because I saw 

1018
00:52:28,081 --> 00:52:32,010
immediately my friends on the left 
saying American foreign policy,

1019
00:52:32,011 --> 00:52:35,100
American foreign policy,
even though two days later,

1020
00:52:35,101 --> 00:52:35,934
you know,
Boko Haram killed 140 people and 

1021
00:52:38,011 --> 00:52:40,170
obviously that has nothing to do with 
foreign policy,

1022
00:52:40,350 --> 00:52:41,183
but.
But there's this rationalization even 

1023
00:52:42,451 --> 00:52:43,284
though at the same time the people who 
did the Paris attacks were saying this 

1024
00:52:47,251 --> 00:52:49,080
is for religious purposes.

1025
00:52:49,340 --> 00:52:52,700
Yeah.
But your friends on the left,

1026
00:52:52,701 --> 00:52:54,440
your source gallery,
the history of narcissism,

1027
00:52:54,460 --> 00:52:55,970
of the history of communism.
Yes.

1028
00:52:56,090 --> 00:52:59,060
There are rational reasons.
So you can blame,

1029
00:52:59,730 --> 00:53:01,090
you know,
you could say if,

1030
00:53:01,130 --> 00:53:02,300
if,
um,

1031
00:53:03,260 --> 00:53:04,093
yeah,
bombs go off and actually had an office 

1032
00:53:05,721 --> 00:53:06,850
in Paris,
you're friends will have said,

1033
00:53:06,880 --> 00:53:07,713
oh,
it's their fault.

1034
00:53:07,930 --> 00:53:08,763
They,
the peanuts cartoon and Mohamad people 

1035
00:53:11,820 --> 00:53:16,820
slaughtered a,
I think every supermarket in Paris,

1036
00:53:17,240 --> 00:53:19,040
the hypogastric Oh,
it's their fault.

1037
00:53:19,400 --> 00:53:20,930
Uh,
because of Israel,

1038
00:53:21,020 --> 00:53:23,120
because Israel is occupying the West 
Bank.

1039
00:53:23,300 --> 00:53:25,210
So okay,
you killed us service.

1040
00:53:25,480 --> 00:53:26,313
That's okay.
You kill the cues that say people who 

1041
00:53:28,571 --> 00:53:29,404
are or to,
if it's a football stadium started the 

1042
00:53:31,141 --> 00:53:34,170
parents,
people who are slow to a rock concert,

1043
00:53:34,380 --> 00:53:38,880
people are sources of Cambodian 
restaurants on the Parisians well that's

1044
00:53:38,881 --> 00:53:39,714
coming is their fault because we're not 
quite sure American foreign policy be 

1045
00:53:42,571 --> 00:53:43,740
friends for on policy.

1046
00:53:44,220 --> 00:53:48,090
Now.
These all sorts of rational explanations

1047
00:53:48,180 --> 00:53:49,013
and there's a bit of true freedom.
The problem is every step you change 

1048
00:53:52,470 --> 00:53:53,303
seems rational and liberal,
but every step you take takes you away 

1049
00:53:56,521 --> 00:53:59,610
from rationality and liberalism and you 
ran into.

1050
00:53:59,910 --> 00:54:00,743
They're very murderous.
You're trying to explain because you 

1051
00:54:02,611 --> 00:54:06,270
accepted that whole ideology,
but rather turn the standards.

1052
00:54:06,690 --> 00:54:07,523
You don't understand it.
They are not people who are sitting 

1053
00:54:09,751 --> 00:54:11,700
there saying,
well,

1054
00:54:11,701 --> 00:54:12,534
we've got a rational grievance like 
someone's about to file a claim to as a 

1055
00:54:15,380 --> 00:54:16,230
county.
Cool.

1056
00:54:16,500 --> 00:54:19,770
They have a youtube channel is having an
ideology.

1057
00:54:20,420 --> 00:54:25,420
You go and live freely 20 to central,
a last bit of the 20th century,

1058
00:54:25,680 --> 00:54:29,670
20th century when you in ideologies to 
millions of millions of people.

1059
00:54:29,850 --> 00:54:33,690
We still don't understand that.
Someone like Islamic state says,

1060
00:54:33,840 --> 00:54:35,950
we think we can create heaven on earth 
week,

1061
00:54:35,960 --> 00:54:36,793
think we can a caliphate that will 
govern the holder and this will be 

1062
00:54:39,451 --> 00:54:41,370
paradox.
And you do that.

1063
00:54:41,850 --> 00:54:44,370
What's a matter of 1 million,
2 million,

1064
00:54:44,371 --> 00:54:47,070
10 million people are killed.
They don't,

1065
00:54:47,250 --> 00:54:48,630
you,
they think they're explained.

1066
00:54:48,631 --> 00:54:50,100
They don't understand anything.

1067
00:54:50,280 --> 00:54:51,113
Yeah.
So that actually is the ultimate irony 

1068
00:54:52,411 --> 00:54:54,810
because on one hand you're saying,
well,

1069
00:54:54,811 --> 00:54:56,370
look,
if we took everything,

1070
00:54:56,371 --> 00:54:58,470
if we did whatever it is they want us to
do,

1071
00:54:58,471 --> 00:55:00,380
right?
We took all our troops out of here,

1072
00:55:00,390 --> 00:55:01,590
we stopped bombing here,
whatever.

1073
00:55:01,770 --> 00:55:04,020
Then suddenly they,
they'd like us more,

1074
00:55:04,200 --> 00:55:06,880
but that's not what they're saying.
So it really is.

1075
00:55:07,060 --> 00:55:09,710
It's the most ironic a piece

1076
00:55:10,870 --> 00:55:11,940
they want you to do,
Dave,

1077
00:55:11,941 --> 00:55:13,580
is becoming,
then yes.

1078
00:55:15,350 --> 00:55:16,990
I'm.
So here you go.

1079
00:55:17,050 --> 00:55:17,883
I mean,
your friends are in California and 

1080
00:55:19,171 --> 00:55:19,901
probably,
you know,

1081
00:55:19,901 --> 00:55:20,640
I'm,
I'm,

1082
00:55:20,640 --> 00:55:22,210
I'm,
I'm sure they're lovely people.

1083
00:55:22,830 --> 00:55:25,870
So some of them,
um,

1084
00:55:25,930 --> 00:55:26,440
but,
you know,

1085
00:55:26,440 --> 00:55:30,130
I'm sure they think of themselves as 
down to you sexist and racist,

1086
00:55:30,940 --> 00:55:33,190
uh,
until you have a phobic.

1087
00:55:33,640 --> 00:55:36,240
I'm sure they're fine on trans issues,
you know,

1088
00:55:36,430 --> 00:55:41,430
I bet some of them don't even get me,
but they will then through thinking that

1089
00:55:42,360 --> 00:55:47,360
being logical end up defending the most 
sexist,

1090
00:55:47,771 --> 00:55:48,604
racist,
homophobic in liberal movements on the 

1091
00:55:51,380 --> 00:55:52,213
and you certainly the point made by me,
it was a very brilliant French 

1092
00:55:56,200 --> 00:55:58,900
philosopher.
Usually they're very narcissistic way,

1093
00:55:59,890 --> 00:56:02,750
you know,
we all.

1094
00:56:02,790 --> 00:56:04,660
Central is the world,
you know,

1095
00:56:04,780 --> 00:56:07,710
if something terrible happens,
it must be down to us.

1096
00:56:08,300 --> 00:56:11,860
Know the people in the rest of the world
have their own agency,

1097
00:56:12,190 --> 00:56:14,910
not people in the rest of the world.
Cup I guess is wicked little as well.

1098
00:56:14,911 --> 00:56:18,850
You can say our infant say are children 
who are goaded by us.

1099
00:56:18,880 --> 00:56:22,210
It's all down to what we do.
We are still.

1100
00:56:22,380 --> 00:56:23,710
Yeah,
the narcissist ego,

1101
00:56:23,730 --> 00:56:25,750
the people,
the people that sent for before.

1102
00:56:25,890 --> 00:56:26,723
Yeah.
I think what I had done with and he 

1103
00:56:27,931 --> 00:56:28,741
illustrated that point,
he said,

1104
00:56:28,741 --> 00:56:29,574
look,
the world could go to hell in a 

1105
00:56:29,761 --> 00:56:32,040
handbasket and it'll have nothing to do 
with America.

1106
00:56:32,810 --> 00:56:34,190
You just can't.
It's just child.

1107
00:56:34,200 --> 00:56:35,840
It's childlike thinking of.
Yeah.

1108
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:36,833
All right,
so increasing steadily treats Muslim 

1109
00:56:38,951 --> 00:56:43,410
populations as children isn't.
Yeah,

1110
00:56:44,330 --> 00:56:46,230
I mean it says,
he says,

1111
00:56:46,320 --> 00:56:47,200
look,
we're adults.

1112
00:56:47,201 --> 00:56:50,080
We're wearing these white western 
Europeans.

1113
00:56:50,110 --> 00:56:52,050
Yeah,
we can handle satire.

1114
00:56:52,570 --> 00:56:55,240
We can handle all leaders and Godson,
bishops,

1115
00:56:55,690 --> 00:56:56,740
clerics.
Oh my God,

1116
00:56:56,741 --> 00:56:58,930
you can't do those Muslims like 
toddlers.

1117
00:56:59,220 --> 00:57:01,300
You're like violent little delinquent 
children.

1118
00:57:01,600 --> 00:57:04,270
You've shown them a cartoon and they 
start blowing the place up.

1119
00:57:04,460 --> 00:57:05,540
Yeah.
Ironically,

1120
00:57:05,541 --> 00:57:09,890
that's what George W dot Bush called the
soft bigotry of low expectations,

1121
00:57:09,891 --> 00:57:13,030
which I keep crediting Bill Maher with.
But apparently it was George W Bush,

1122
00:57:13,130 --> 00:57:16,720
which is mind blowing.
That's is a very,

1123
00:57:16,721 --> 00:57:19,570
very good for.
And it's true actually.

1124
00:57:19,571 --> 00:57:21,830
It's worse than the soft bigotry.
Uh,

1125
00:57:21,850 --> 00:57:22,683
it does keep people down because look,
most of the men and women watching your 

1126
00:57:27,071 --> 00:57:31,090
program in California doesn't really 
help them when they're going out looking

1127
00:57:31,091 --> 00:57:32,620
for a job,
uh,

1128
00:57:32,621 --> 00:57:33,250
or,
you know,

1129
00:57:33,250 --> 00:57:35,540
looking to get on in life or wanting to 
create respect.

1130
00:57:35,550 --> 00:57:38,800
We want to be crazy recalls if liberals 
all saying,

1131
00:57:38,860 --> 00:57:39,350
oh,
well,

1132
00:57:39,350 --> 00:57:40,900
you know,
that's very,

1133
00:57:40,901 --> 00:57:42,400
very funny people,
these people,

1134
00:57:42,401 --> 00:57:45,240
you have to be very careful what you say
in French car tuned up,

1135
00:57:45,241 --> 00:57:48,100
blow the top of my head.
It doesn't help them.

1136
00:57:48,290 --> 00:57:52,420
It doesn't help them be full citizens to
increase in a totally different way from

1137
00:57:52,421 --> 00:57:53,254
everyone else.

1138
00:57:53,420 --> 00:57:54,380
Yeah,
absolutely.

1139
00:57:54,381 --> 00:57:56,150
All right,
so I have one more for Ya.

1140
00:57:56,330 --> 00:57:58,370
I could do this for five hours with you,
so you'll have to.

1141
00:57:58,610 --> 00:57:59,443
You'll have to come on again.
I want you to have your tea and go to 

1142
00:58:05,221 --> 00:58:06,540
bed.
So I'll end with this.

1143
00:58:06,541 --> 00:58:09,360
Look,
you wrote what's left in 2007.

1144
00:58:09,630 --> 00:58:11,610
Uh,
that was eight years ago.

1145
00:58:11,760 --> 00:58:13,770
So let's fast forward eight years from 
now.

1146
00:58:13,771 --> 00:58:15,180
It's 20,
23.

1147
00:58:15,670 --> 00:58:18,510
Give me a little hope if you can find 
some hope,

1148
00:58:18,511 --> 00:58:19,344
but if you can't then give me where you 
think we're going to be at eight years 

1149
00:58:21,271 --> 00:58:22,104
from now.

1150
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:23,980
Well,
that was,

1151
00:58:24,420 --> 00:58:27,860
that was quite hopeful.
I'm working on.

1152
00:58:27,900 --> 00:58:28,733
I wrote that lesson.
I hope it will run ally on a liberal 

1153
00:58:35,590 --> 00:58:38,140
intellectuals,
feminists,

1154
00:58:38,320 --> 00:58:40,510
uh,
within the Muslim world.

1155
00:58:40,740 --> 00:58:41,573
Uh,
we're in Muslim communities in the west 

1156
00:58:43,871 --> 00:58:48,440
taking on various treatments.
I just hope that shame,

1157
00:58:48,910 --> 00:58:50,800
which has descended on Western 
liberalism,

1158
00:58:51,630 --> 00:58:52,463
it's almost shameful periods of history 
that when those liberals and Democrats 

1159
00:58:56,951 --> 00:58:57,784
and those feminist take home,
they're extremist fucking western 

1160
00:59:02,170 --> 00:59:03,820
liberals.
They're meant to do.

1161
00:59:03,821 --> 00:59:08,020
And support them instead of supposedly 
they are in the mess to make any excuses

1162
00:59:08,021 --> 00:59:08,854
for that randomness for once lives,
their principals or otherwise they'll 

1163
00:59:13,631 --> 00:59:14,620
just give up,
get up,

1164
00:59:14,621 --> 00:59:16,670
shut up.
Say actually we don't really talk.

1165
00:59:16,750 --> 00:59:19,200
We just want to go to the beach,
have a beer,

1166
00:59:19,270 --> 00:59:22,100
dental care and we didn't really care 
about other people but either

1167
00:59:22,160 --> 00:59:26,330
give up or show some solidarity.
I love that.

1168
00:59:26,331 --> 00:59:29,510
And I do like a well placed fuck.
So that was a,

1169
00:59:29,540 --> 00:59:30,373
that was really nice to uh,
you guys can pick up either of nick's 

1170
00:59:32,631 --> 00:59:33,464
books,
wherever books are sold or you can 

1171
00:59:34,461 --> 00:59:35,294
download an ebook however you do that.
I did it so you can probably figure it 

1172
00:59:37,701 --> 00:59:38,480
out.
Uh,

1173
00:59:38,480 --> 00:59:39,530
nick,
it was really,

1174
00:59:39,531 --> 00:59:42,080
it was an absolute pleasure.
I hope we can do this in La,

1175
00:59:42,081 --> 00:59:42,914
uh,
in,

1176
00:59:42,940 --> 00:59:43,773
in person next time.
And I thank you guys for watching and 

1177
00:59:47,421 --> 00:59:48,260
we'll do it again next week.
