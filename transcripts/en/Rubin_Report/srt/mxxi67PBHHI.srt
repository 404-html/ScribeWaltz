1
00:00:05,110 --> 00:00:06,220
Folks,
it's official.

2
00:00:06,221 --> 00:00:10,030
We are entering the age of unenlightened
meant my friend,

3
00:00:10,031 --> 00:00:12,190
a true feminist in the best sense of the
word,

4
00:00:12,191 --> 00:00:13,024
and a fearless defender of free speech.
Christina Hoff sommers was invited to 

5
00:00:16,661 --> 00:00:19,300
speak at Lewis and Clark law school this
week.

6
00:00:19,510 --> 00:00:21,850
Here's what happened when she began her 
talk.

7
00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:39,260
Christina Christina,
victim mentality.

8
00:01:07,540 --> 00:01:12,540
Microaggressions are real,
real,

9
00:01:15,210 --> 00:01:18,400
real,
real,

10
00:01:20,140 --> 00:01:20,973
real.

11
00:01:28,220 --> 00:01:29,930
Putting aside the creepiness of the 
comb,

12
00:01:29,931 --> 00:01:32,240
like repetitive chanting from the 
protesters.

13
00:01:32,241 --> 00:01:36,350
Their use of free speech actually isn't 
a use of free speech at all.

14
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:39,980
While of course they have the right to 
protest your right to exercise.

15
00:01:39,981 --> 00:01:40,814
Your free speech doesn't come at the 
expense of someone else's right to 

16
00:01:44,121 --> 00:01:45,770
exercise.
There's so.

17
00:01:45,771 --> 00:01:49,950
What this means is yes,
you can peacefully protest outside of an

18
00:01:49,951 --> 00:01:50,784
event.
You can silently protest inside of an 

19
00:01:53,241 --> 00:01:54,074
event.
You can hold all the signs you want and 

20
00:01:56,151 --> 00:01:59,210
you can encourage others to join your 
cause.

21
00:01:59,510 --> 00:02:00,650
You cannot,
however,

22
00:02:00,651 --> 00:02:03,890
use your freedoms to trample on the 
freedoms of others.

23
00:02:04,130 --> 00:02:04,963
This chanting,
which again took place before Christina 

24
00:02:07,071 --> 00:02:07,904
had even begun to speak,
reminded me of when I was at Ucla with 

25
00:02:10,911 --> 00:02:11,744
Milo Yiannopoulos about two years ago,
protesters screen spit through garbage 

26
00:02:15,921 --> 00:02:17,690
cans,
pulled fire alarms,

27
00:02:17,691 --> 00:02:20,930
and even called him bomb threats before 
we even took the stage.

28
00:02:21,710 --> 00:02:22,543
Perhaps most egregiously though was the 
group of students who linked arms to 

29
00:02:26,181 --> 00:02:30,860
create a human wall to stop us and other
viewers from even going inside the venue

30
00:02:30,861 --> 00:02:33,830
itself.
Apparently they aren't against walls,

31
00:02:33,831 --> 00:02:34,664
they just don't like trump's wall.
Christina has continued through the 

32
00:02:37,671 --> 00:02:40,970
chanting and the protestors then broke 
out in song.

33
00:02:44,570 --> 00:02:49,570
We've gone side.
Which side are you on?

34
00:03:03,191 --> 00:03:05,650
Fred's.
Which side are you on?

35
00:03:05,790 --> 00:03:07,470
Quite a catchy tune,
wouldn't you say?

36
00:03:08,010 --> 00:03:09,570
Of course.
Christina Hoff.

37
00:03:09,571 --> 00:03:10,404
Sommers is in a fascist at all.
She's just an old school liberal who 

38
00:03:13,261 --> 00:03:16,950
dare challenge Modern Day leftism 
ironically,

39
00:03:16,951 --> 00:03:21,030
bs people so keen on fighting the fake 
fascism in their minds,

40
00:03:21,031 --> 00:03:21,864
don't understand that they themselves 
are the ones who are actually using 

41
00:03:24,841 --> 00:03:29,010
fascist tactics of silencing and 
drowning out their opponents until there

42
00:03:29,011 --> 00:03:33,480
is no opposition remaining at all.
But if you're still confused,

43
00:03:33,481 --> 00:03:34,314
here's a simple definition of fascism.
Fascism is a form of radical 

44
00:03:37,860 --> 00:03:42,510
authoritarian nationalism characterized 
by dictatorial power,

45
00:03:42,690 --> 00:03:47,340
forcible suppression of opposition and 
Control of industry and commerce,

46
00:03:47,341 --> 00:03:50,820
which came to prominence in early 20th 
century Europe.

47
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:54,720
Do you think that Christina Hoff sommers
is for dictatorial power?

48
00:03:54,950 --> 00:03:57,720
Is she for forcible suppression of 
opposition?

49
00:03:57,900 --> 00:03:58,733
To top it off,
she even works at the American 

50
00:04:00,930 --> 00:04:03,000
Enterprise Institute,
which is against control of industry and

51
00:04:03,001 --> 00:04:04,620
commerce.
Now,

52
00:04:04,621 --> 00:04:05,454
just think for a moment if the idea is 
that these students were espousing were 

53
00:04:08,461 --> 00:04:09,294
the set of ideas and power,
they actually would be for dictatorial 

54
00:04:12,661 --> 00:04:13,494
control as they believed their cause is 
the most just and their opponents are 

55
00:04:17,041 --> 00:04:18,090
simply evil.

56
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:21,990
How do you think it would be going for 
dissent and opposition in their system?

57
00:04:22,290 --> 00:04:23,123
Perhaps the most insidious piece of the 
Cultural Marxism that we see spreading 

58
00:04:26,371 --> 00:04:27,204
on college campuses these days is that 
it is using the freedoms that are 

59
00:04:30,781 --> 00:04:34,800
democratic capitalist society has 
against itself.

60
00:04:35,130 --> 00:04:35,963
Of course,
they would never offer these same 

61
00:04:36,901 --> 00:04:41,190
protections to minority voices in the 
dystopian future that it would bring.

62
00:04:42,060 --> 00:04:42,893
While this event thankfully wasn't 
nearly as violent as when Milo went to 

63
00:04:45,870 --> 00:04:50,280
uc Berkeley and the school burned down 
or when it took $600,000

64
00:04:50,281 --> 00:04:54,180
of security to ensure that Ben Shapiro 
could speak there without threat.

65
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:55,313
This display at Lewis and Clark is just 
another reminder of how the backwards 

66
00:04:59,431 --> 00:05:00,264
thinking of Cultural Marxism is coming 
for all dissenters cloaked in the mask 

67
00:05:04,801 --> 00:05:05,634
of tolerance and diversity.
These incidences are happening all over 

68
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:10,313
colleges,
all over the country and turning places 

69
00:05:11,941 --> 00:05:12,774
of higher learning into places where 
people are just getting high on 

70
00:05:16,201 --> 00:05:17,280
intersectionality.

71
00:05:17,850 --> 00:05:18,683
Sadly,
this story really only broke on right 

72
00:05:20,301 --> 00:05:21,134
leaning blogs and was only shared by the
usual suspects who continually defend 

73
00:05:24,721 --> 00:05:27,060
freedom of expression.
As of recording this,

74
00:05:27,061 --> 00:05:29,820
I haven't seen any left leaning websites
that covered it.

75
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:31,770
The reason for this,
of course,

76
00:05:31,771 --> 00:05:33,540
is twofold.
On one hand,

77
00:05:33,541 --> 00:05:36,360
when you can win arguments by silencing 
your opponents,

78
00:05:36,361 --> 00:05:38,820
your job is pretty easy,
but also,

79
00:05:38,821 --> 00:05:42,150
and perhaps more importantly,
the good actors on the left,

80
00:05:42,151 --> 00:05:46,410
which I still believe there are some who
want to call out events like this.

81
00:05:46,411 --> 00:05:47,244
Rarely do because they know that the 
same tactics of smearing and silencing 

82
00:05:51,391 --> 00:05:52,224
will eventually be used against them and
then there'll be purged from their 

83
00:05:55,411 --> 00:05:59,150
former home just as former guests of 
mine like Bret Weinstein,

84
00:05:59,151 --> 00:06:00,800
Laura Kipnis,
Lindsay Shepherd,

85
00:06:00,801 --> 00:06:05,801
and others who dare speak out against 
this tyrannical fo diversity movement.

86
00:06:06,260 --> 00:06:07,640
The silver lining though,
of course,

87
00:06:07,641 --> 00:06:09,920
is that the more that people like Brett,
Laura,

88
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:10,873
and others speak out,
the more room may give for people like 

89
00:06:13,161 --> 00:06:16,460
you to do the exact same in your life.
Speaking of Berkeley,

90
00:06:16,461 --> 00:06:17,294
I spoke there yesterday with Heather 
Mcdonald and Steve Simpson and I'll be 

91
00:06:19,611 --> 00:06:22,130
speaking at many other colleges in the 
coming months.

92
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:26,600
Come join me wherever I may be an asked 
me as many hard questions in the q and a

93
00:06:26,601 --> 00:06:27,434
as you'd like.
I ask only one thing which is that if 

94
00:06:29,151 --> 00:06:29,984
you sing,
please make it a little snappier than 

95
00:06:31,581 --> 00:06:33,470
what we just heard.
A cover of journey,

96
00:06:33,471 --> 00:06:34,304
fleetwood Mac,
or even Frank Sinatra would be 

97
00:06:35,811 --> 00:06:36,644
preferable.

98
00:06:41,570 --> 00:06:46,010
Joining me today is the senior editor of
the Atlantic or contributor on MSNBC and

99
00:06:46,011 --> 00:06:48,140
the author of the new book,
trump ocracy,

100
00:06:48,141 --> 00:06:51,190
the corruption of the American republic.
David,

101
00:06:51,260 --> 00:06:53,300
and welcome to the Rubin report.
Thank you so much for having me.

102
00:06:53,510 --> 00:06:56,780
I'm glad to have you here.
I wanted you on for a couple of years.

103
00:06:56,781 --> 00:06:58,820
I think at this point you were a tough 
guy to track down,

104
00:06:58,821 --> 00:07:03,770
but we made it happen.
I'm find-able hiding yet.

105
00:07:03,830 --> 00:07:06,530
You're not in hiding yet.
You couldn't be maybe by the end of this

106
00:07:06,530 --> 00:07:09,560
interview because I let my guests talk 
and you'd never know.

107
00:07:09,770 --> 00:07:11,480
Right?
That's the twitter formula.

108
00:07:11,481 --> 00:07:12,314
You're.
You're like 140 characters away from 

109
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:16,250
career self-immolation yeah.
Well,

110
00:07:16,251 --> 00:07:19,630
we've got about 60 minutes.
We'll see about emulation immediately.

111
00:07:19,631 --> 00:07:21,200
All right,
so a lot of the things I want to talk to

112
00:07:21,201 --> 00:07:21,881
you about.
I thought your,

113
00:07:21,881 --> 00:07:25,670
your personal history is interesting and
usually when I see you on television,

114
00:07:25,671 --> 00:07:29,150
you're talking about the day to day 
machinations of politics.

115
00:07:29,420 --> 00:07:31,940
You are Canadian.
I did not know that.

116
00:07:31,941 --> 00:07:34,310
I find that I like Canadians.
Just everyone does.

117
00:07:34,670 --> 00:07:37,310
Why are you people so agreeable?
Because we're so passive aggressive,

118
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:40,230
uh,
I grew up,

119
00:07:40,230 --> 00:07:41,410
I grew up in Toronto.
I'm,

120
00:07:41,550 --> 00:07:42,383
I'm,
I'm,

121
00:07:42,990 --> 00:07:43,823
we have a place in Prince Edward County,
which is about two and a half east of 

122
00:07:47,690 --> 00:07:49,550
Toronto,
two and half hours east of Toronto where

123
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:52,830
my wife and I and our children are spent
summers now for almost three decades.

124
00:07:53,350 --> 00:07:54,740
Um,
uh,

125
00:07:55,170 --> 00:07:56,020
Canada's uh,
is,

126
00:07:56,030 --> 00:07:57,280
um,
is,

127
00:07:57,640 --> 00:08:00,870
is a kind of mirror image of the United 
States with some things,

128
00:08:00,871 --> 00:08:03,360
omitted things intensified.
And so,

129
00:08:03,361 --> 00:08:05,400
and I think it offers Americans often a 
kind of,

130
00:08:05,430 --> 00:08:08,580
um,
wha what if a examination of the,

131
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:11,900
of what the United States might have 
been under different circumstances.

132
00:08:11,930 --> 00:08:12,763
That's an interesting phrase.
What do you think's omitted and what do 

133
00:08:14,341 --> 00:08:16,460
you think is intensified?
Um,

134
00:08:16,530 --> 00:08:20,490
so a candidate didn't have the American 
south.

135
00:08:20,740 --> 00:08:22,890
It didn't have slavery,
he didn't have a civil war.

136
00:08:23,100 --> 00:08:23,933
Um,
Canada had a peaceful separation from 

137
00:08:25,471 --> 00:08:27,450
Great Britain.
So it doesn't have the,

138
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:30,810
it doesn't have the kind of citizen,
military traditions.

139
00:08:30,811 --> 00:08:32,970
Canadians have a very different attitude
towards guns.

140
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:33,300
I mean,
they're,

141
00:08:33,300 --> 00:08:35,160
my neighbors in Prince Edward County,
um,

142
00:08:35,430 --> 00:08:38,610
all have,
are not all but many have long guns,

143
00:08:38,910 --> 00:08:40,260
hunting pieces,
shotguns,

144
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:41,333
but the idea of having a handgun or a 
military style weapon is a very alien 

145
00:08:45,301 --> 00:08:46,630
idea for Canadians.
Yeah.

146
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:51,660
You think some of the Canadian attitude 
is also that there's a lot of geographic

147
00:08:51,661 --> 00:08:54,660
space and not that many people actually.
Yes.

148
00:08:54,710 --> 00:08:55,271
Um,
well,

149
00:08:55,271 --> 00:08:55,821
there,
there it,

150
00:08:55,821 --> 00:08:56,100
it

151
00:08:56,100 --> 00:08:59,700
can be Kinda,
it can be kinda spooky at night.

152
00:09:00,060 --> 00:09:00,893
I mean there,
there are great cities and Canadian 

153
00:09:01,591 --> 00:09:03,540
Canada is much more urbanized place in 
the United States.

154
00:09:03,990 --> 00:09:05,820
Canadians are more likely to live in 
Toronto,

155
00:09:05,821 --> 00:09:06,780
Vancouver,
Calgary,

156
00:09:06,781 --> 00:09:07,730
Edmonton,
Montreal,

157
00:09:07,740 --> 00:09:09,060
those places.
Um,

158
00:09:09,900 --> 00:09:11,120
but uh,
there,

159
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:13,590
there's a,
I'm in a line from a poem.

160
00:09:13,591 --> 00:09:14,424
The wild is always there.
And even when you live in the center of 

161
00:09:16,591 --> 00:09:20,130
Toronto,
you can be mauled by a lion.

162
00:09:20,510 --> 00:09:21,343
You can head off,
you can start driving and pretty soon 

163
00:09:22,850 --> 00:09:23,660
you're in the wild.

164
00:09:23,660 --> 00:09:24,500
Yeah.
Interesting.

165
00:09:24,501 --> 00:09:29,000
So your mom was on the Canadian 
Broadcasting Network

166
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:30,420
or company?
CBC.

167
00:09:30,450 --> 00:09:32,210
Canadian Broadcasting Corporation 
Corporation.

168
00:09:32,220 --> 00:09:34,390
Okay.
Linda from tell me a little bit that was

169
00:09:34,650 --> 00:09:36,660
Linda from is my sister who's a member 
of the Canadian,

170
00:09:37,590 --> 00:09:38,880
two things where the department know 
now,

171
00:09:38,881 --> 00:09:39,714
but she's a very prominent person to 
learn from as a member of the Canadian 

172
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:42,713
Senate.
I'm a leader in the Canadian 

173
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:45,713
Conservative Party.
Um,

174
00:09:45,810 --> 00:09:49,460
my late mother,
Barbara from was the host.

175
00:09:49,461 --> 00:09:53,850
I it correct here to keep my biography 
in your head.

176
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:55,440
I was just testing you on your own 
biography.

177
00:09:55,610 --> 00:09:56,401
Uh,
she was,

178
00:09:56,401 --> 00:09:58,080
um,
a radio interview on a show called as it

179
00:09:58,081 --> 00:09:59,520
happens for a decade.
Um,

180
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:00,360
and then,
uh,

181
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:01,800
was the founder of a show called the 
journal,

182
00:10:01,801 --> 00:10:02,634
which was one of those face to face TV 
shows at a time when satellite in 

183
00:10:06,210 --> 00:10:11,210
satellite communication was quite knew 
she died in 1992 at the age of 54.

184
00:10:12,030 --> 00:10:14,010
Was Your family always political?
I mean,

185
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:15,660
it sounds like probably right.

186
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:17,730
Well,
my family was interested in politics.

187
00:10:18,180 --> 00:10:20,160
My late father was a businessman,
not a,

188
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:23,120
not involved in the political world and 
he had a lot of distance from,

189
00:10:23,410 --> 00:10:25,020
from politics.
Um,

190
00:10:25,140 --> 00:10:25,973
but yes,
I mean,

191
00:10:26,010 --> 00:10:28,950
my parents dinner table was a place.
It was a high pressure environment.

192
00:10:28,980 --> 00:10:29,440
They,
they,

193
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:32,280
they thought deeply about things,
but they were not ideological.

194
00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:33,533
And one of the places where I really,
I mean learn to think was around that 

195
00:10:36,721 --> 00:10:38,440
dinner table because,
um,

196
00:10:39,020 --> 00:10:39,853
you know,
my,

197
00:10:40,050 --> 00:10:41,580
my mother is very skeptical about 
everything,

198
00:10:41,581 --> 00:10:44,670
including her own children and the way 
she,

199
00:10:44,671 --> 00:10:46,020
when you were saying something she 
doesn't like,

200
00:10:46,021 --> 00:10:47,770
but she would never argue with you,
but she,

201
00:10:47,780 --> 00:10:48,613
you just set marching these two lines of
interrogatory questions and you would 

202
00:10:52,561 --> 00:10:53,394
eventually realized I'm caught between 
these two lines and she would force you 

203
00:10:56,491 --> 00:10:59,490
to think more deeply about.
And not just political things but uh,

204
00:10:59,491 --> 00:11:01,170
but everything.
Why do you do that?

205
00:11:01,171 --> 00:11:03,420
Why do you say that?
Why do you think that's funny?

206
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:04,673
And,
um,

207
00:11:04,740 --> 00:11:08,590
it made you a more conscious person.
Um,

208
00:11:08,700 --> 00:11:11,760
and I try to live up to that and the way
I raise my own children,

209
00:11:11,770 --> 00:11:12,603
you never try,
try never to tell them what to do or 

210
00:11:14,671 --> 00:11:15,840
what they,
what to think,

211
00:11:15,841 --> 00:11:16,674
but instead to challenge them to think 
and to think more deeply and not just 

212
00:11:20,821 --> 00:11:22,410
about the big things but everything.

213
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:23,673
Do you think that's what we're 
fundamentally missing in society right 

214
00:11:25,841 --> 00:11:26,141
now?
I mean,

215
00:11:26,141 --> 00:11:28,270
I think it's what I try to bring to this
show.

216
00:11:28,271 --> 00:11:29,104
I try to let my guest talk even when I 
disagree with them and maybe poke and 

217
00:11:32,171 --> 00:11:34,570
prod them in ways to,
to learn a little bit more,

218
00:11:34,571 --> 00:11:35,404
but that everyone in the media these 
days is just pounding at each other and 

219
00:11:39,251 --> 00:11:40,084
hitting each other and trying to destroy
each other instead of sort of going 

220
00:11:43,301 --> 00:11:44,134
along that journey with you and figuring
out why you think that way and more 

221
00:11:46,841 --> 00:11:48,310
importantly how you think.

222
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:49,990
I,
I think it's just human nature.

223
00:11:50,260 --> 00:11:51,200
I think,
um,

224
00:11:51,610 --> 00:11:56,600
I think it's human nature to be tough on
others and soft on ourselves and uh,

225
00:11:56,710 --> 00:12:00,020
it,
it's a real discipline and um,

226
00:12:00,070 --> 00:12:00,970
uh,
to say,

227
00:12:00,971 --> 00:12:01,804
you know what,
maybe I should be soft on others and 

228
00:12:02,681 --> 00:12:05,530
tough on myself.
So there's an interesting story.

229
00:12:05,531 --> 00:12:10,531
I want to get this totally right.
When you were 14 you volunteered for the

230
00:12:10,900 --> 00:12:11,680
Ontario New Democratic Party.
Yes.

231
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:13,270
So far so good.
So far so good.

232
00:12:13,650 --> 00:12:16,510
And for those who don't follow Canadian 
politics as closely.

233
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:19,240
So the Ontario MD,
the NDP is the left party in Canada,

234
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:21,190
it's a multiparty system.
Um,

235
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:22,113
and uh,
a candidate of course has a 

236
00:12:24,251 --> 00:12:27,340
parliamentary system and there was a 
provincial election and I was interested

237
00:12:27,341 --> 00:12:28,930
in seeing how politics worked.
I wasn't,

238
00:12:29,530 --> 00:12:30,363
I didn't really have political ideas,
but I was interested in campaigns and I 

239
00:12:33,610 --> 00:12:36,780
volunteered on that campaign.
So on that campaign,

240
00:12:36,790 --> 00:12:41,790
you're 14 years old and on your commute 
you're reading the Gulag archipelago?

241
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:42,780
Well,
we,

242
00:12:42,780 --> 00:12:43,840
there was a,
it was a bus,

243
00:12:43,870 --> 00:12:45,470
subway,
streetcar to go.

244
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:48,100
It was really something for a volunteer,
right?

245
00:12:48,101 --> 00:12:48,934
It was summer holiday.
And so my mother had given me as a 

246
00:12:50,651 --> 00:12:51,484
birthday present,
I'm the paperback edition of the Gulag 

247
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:55,353
Archipelago and urged me to read it.
And so I had a lot of time on that 

248
00:12:59,051 --> 00:13:00,970
commute and uh,
it had,

249
00:13:01,030 --> 00:13:02,680
it hit me like a bomb.
Um,

250
00:13:03,070 --> 00:13:03,761
and I,
I think,

251
00:13:03,761 --> 00:13:06,550
um,
I mean my family in know are,

252
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:11,410
were not my parents got out of Europe,
my family,

253
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:14,020
my family's got out of Europe before the
war,

254
00:13:14,021 --> 00:13:16,640
but they left people behind and so in 
Polish.

255
00:13:16,750 --> 00:13:20,840
So most of my father's family were 
annihilated in the Holocaust and a very.

256
00:13:21,140 --> 00:13:23,620
So that was something he was always very
conscious in my mind.

257
00:13:23,621 --> 00:13:26,590
And then here was this other story that 
I had not heard so much about it.

258
00:13:26,620 --> 00:13:27,453
And it,
it,

259
00:13:27,460 --> 00:13:29,140
um,
it shaped me.

260
00:13:29,830 --> 00:13:32,930
How does that shape a 14 year old?
Well,

261
00:13:32,980 --> 00:13:33,813
it,
um,

262
00:13:34,510 --> 00:13:35,343
it would,
it makes you aware of is that human 

263
00:13:38,381 --> 00:13:40,240
history is very tragic,
um,

264
00:13:40,450 --> 00:13:41,283
that you can't really rely that power 
can be abused and it makes you begin to 

265
00:13:46,181 --> 00:13:47,170
think very hard about,
well,

266
00:13:47,171 --> 00:13:48,004
how do we build a society?
So there I was on the Toronto subway 

267
00:13:50,561 --> 00:13:51,394
system in a society that really worked 
and it forces you to think most 

268
00:13:54,251 --> 00:13:56,200
societies aren't like this in most 
societies.

269
00:13:56,201 --> 00:14:00,130
People are exposed to random terror and 
too dictatorial power.

270
00:14:00,340 --> 00:14:01,173
How do you make societies that,
that work in the protect people and 

271
00:14:03,581 --> 00:14:06,260
respect human dignity and human freedom?
Um,

272
00:14:06,340 --> 00:14:09,220
so I began and of course at 14 you have 
no answers,

273
00:14:09,221 --> 00:14:11,050
but you made you become interested in 
the question.

274
00:14:11,270 --> 00:14:14,350
And what you also know is that when 
people say,

275
00:14:14,410 --> 00:14:19,410
I have a great scheme for humanity,
it just requires a few prison camps.

276
00:14:21,300 --> 00:14:22,061
You learn,
you know what,

277
00:14:22,061 --> 00:14:24,040
it's probably not such a good scheme,
right?

278
00:14:24,070 --> 00:14:26,200
Although they usually don't tell you it 
requires prison gifts.

279
00:14:26,201 --> 00:14:28,210
It usually tells you it requires a lot 
of good things,

280
00:14:28,211 --> 00:14:28,841
right?
I mean,

281
00:14:28,841 --> 00:14:31,560
isn't that the real trick?
But it generally.

282
00:14:31,630 --> 00:14:35,380
But it tells you at,
I'm at you.

283
00:14:35,381 --> 00:14:37,320
There are warnings early on,
um,

284
00:14:37,630 --> 00:14:40,670
their warnings early on in any utopian 
project like that.

285
00:14:41,260 --> 00:14:43,110
We're going to have to,
you know,

286
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:44,073
break,
break some eggs here to make her an 

287
00:14:45,251 --> 00:14:46,420
Omelet at first year,
right?

288
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:48,480
At first the eggs or not.
Um,

289
00:14:49,010 --> 00:14:51,800
and at first the eggs are kind of small,
but,

290
00:14:52,170 --> 00:14:53,240
uh,
the first.

291
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:56,900
But you can tell those steps and that 
one of the things that,

292
00:14:56,901 --> 00:14:58,280
um,
you know,

293
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:00,580
uh,
I mean this is,

294
00:15:00,590 --> 00:15:01,423
I think one of the reasons why people 
look at what's happening on campuses 

295
00:15:02,961 --> 00:15:04,760
with such alarm.
Because,

296
00:15:05,010 --> 00:15:05,843
you know,
obviously those are the people who are 

297
00:15:06,951 --> 00:15:10,310
shouting down people on campus.
They don't have police forces,

298
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:13,800
but they've made it pretty clear how,
if they ever did have a police force,

299
00:15:14,220 --> 00:15:15,540
how they use.
Yeah.

300
00:15:16,170 --> 00:15:17,003
So when I first came across you,
I think it was probably maybe 10 years 

301
00:15:21,271 --> 00:15:22,104
ago,
you were on realtime a lot and I would 

302
00:15:23,001 --> 00:15:26,280
say I would just see you on different 
television and it was probably when,

303
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:30,210
for me personally,
I was a little more left than maybe I am

304
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:32,340
at the moment.
Um,

305
00:15:32,460 --> 00:15:33,293
or at least the whole overton window has
just shifted that it's hard to put 

306
00:15:35,521 --> 00:15:37,500
anyone on a,
on the traditional map anymore,

307
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:38,513
but I always sort of,
you always struck me as like a sensible 

308
00:15:40,411 --> 00:15:42,600
conservative.
I never watched you and was like,

309
00:15:42,601 --> 00:15:43,434
ah,
that's the guy I disagree with on the 

310
00:15:44,611 --> 00:15:45,150
right,
you know,

311
00:15:45,150 --> 00:15:50,010
in some like crazed way.
What does conservatism because you,

312
00:15:50,011 --> 00:15:51,240
you are a conservative,
right?

313
00:15:51,300 --> 00:15:54,150
I would say I would use the adjective.
I am conservative.

314
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:56,850
I stopped using the noun.
A conservative.

315
00:15:57,150 --> 00:15:57,983
Interesting.
That's an interesting distinction and 

316
00:15:59,431 --> 00:16:01,560
it,
it makes sense to me relative to so many

317
00:16:01,561 --> 00:16:05,150
things changing right now.
What does conservatism generally meet?

318
00:16:05,610 --> 00:16:06,443
Well,
I think it starts with the way our 

319
00:16:08,161 --> 00:16:10,560
brains are built,
that there are people who,

320
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:11,673
um,
are more conscious of risk and their 

321
00:16:13,381 --> 00:16:17,190
people are less conscious of risk that 
people who hanker for change,

322
00:16:17,191 --> 00:16:21,270
there are people who are ready to stick 
with president evils rather than try new

323
00:16:21,271 --> 00:16:23,970
ones and that's just a matter of brain 
chemistry.

324
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:26,333
Then when people with those different 
brain chemistry approach the problems 

325
00:16:29,971 --> 00:16:33,120
with society,
they start building systems of ideas.

326
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:37,380
So the reason I stopped using the phrase
a conservative and stopped talking about

327
00:16:37,381 --> 00:16:41,540
the conservative movement is what I 
would've called conservatives.

328
00:16:41,541 --> 00:16:42,374
And when I came out of college in 1982 
was a set of answers to the problems in 

329
00:16:45,001 --> 00:16:48,180
the 19 seventies and eighties inflation 
crime,

330
00:16:48,390 --> 00:16:50,760
Soviet menace,
the disorder in American life.

331
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:51,793
I'm sluggish.
Productivity growth and the 

332
00:16:54,331 --> 00:16:55,164
Conservatives have those days had a 
series of policy recommendations for 

333
00:16:57,511 --> 00:16:58,344
those problems.

334
00:16:58,500 --> 00:17:03,500
And by and large they worked and the 
result was that the problems either were

335
00:17:04,260 --> 00:17:07,620
overcome or anyway,
so reduced insignificance.

336
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:10,830
They stopped being the most important 
problems that Americans cared about.

337
00:17:11,220 --> 00:17:14,580
New problems came to the fore and about 
those new problems,

338
00:17:14,581 --> 00:17:19,581
conservatives had the same old answers 
they've had back in 1982 and it became a

339
00:17:19,741 --> 00:17:20,574
kind of fetish that if lower taxes with 
the right way to respond to low 

340
00:17:26,401 --> 00:17:27,234
productivity growth in 1982,
then if you had completely different 

341
00:17:30,841 --> 00:17:34,980
problems in 2008,
then obviously still lower taxes.

342
00:17:35,100 --> 00:17:35,933
Must be the same.
Must work just as well as they did with 

343
00:17:37,981 --> 00:17:40,380
a completely different set of problems 
in 1982.

344
00:17:41,450 --> 00:17:42,460
Um,
so I,

345
00:17:42,461 --> 00:17:45,240
I think what has happened is that the 
conservative movement,

346
00:17:45,510 --> 00:17:47,550
conservative politics is a fossil.
It's,

347
00:17:47,850 --> 00:17:50,370
it's,
it's interesting in that it reveal,

348
00:17:50,371 --> 00:17:51,204
it's like an earthing,
some piece of rock from a different 

349
00:17:53,611 --> 00:17:54,480
geological era.

350
00:17:54,690 --> 00:17:57,990
It tells you something about what people
had on their minds in 1982.

351
00:17:58,290 --> 00:17:59,123
But if you say,
how am I going to solve the problems of 

352
00:18:00,181 --> 00:18:02,820
2018,
not so helpful.

353
00:18:02,990 --> 00:18:03,823
Yeah.
So when people say that are 

354
00:18:04,681 --> 00:18:08,760
conservatives now,
does that have any particular meaning to

355
00:18:08,761 --> 00:18:09,211
you?
Like,

356
00:18:09,211 --> 00:18:12,960
I guess there is the set that you're 
talking about from [inaudible] 82 that's

357
00:18:12,961 --> 00:18:13,820
going,
you know,

358
00:18:14,150 --> 00:18:17,130
what the answers are then,
but that seems very different from now.

359
00:18:17,131 --> 00:18:17,964
And then of course,
we're obviously gonna spend a lot of 

360
00:18:18,541 --> 00:18:20,880
time talking about trump and that really
has flipped this on it.

361
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:22,433
This is what has made trump possible.
This is why the conservative movement 

362
00:18:24,391 --> 00:18:29,391
has sort of worked itself out of a job.
So the actual content of conservatism,

363
00:18:30,690 --> 00:18:31,523
as you know,
what is conservatism have to say about 

364
00:18:33,331 --> 00:18:36,420
the opioid epidemic?
What does it have to say about,

365
00:18:36,530 --> 00:18:37,800
um,
uh,

366
00:18:38,100 --> 00:18:39,090
the great recession.

367
00:18:39,090 --> 00:18:39,923
What does it have to say about the 
collapse in life expectancy among non 

368
00:18:42,780 --> 00:18:46,500
college Americans?
What does it have to say about America's

369
00:18:46,501 --> 00:18:47,334
place in the world in a,
in a world in which we're no longer 

370
00:18:48,991 --> 00:18:52,440
competing with an ideological nuclear 
superpower of the Soviet Union,

371
00:18:52,441 --> 00:18:53,274
but with,
uh,

372
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:56,790
with these opportunistic actors that 
have like Russia and China,

373
00:18:57,120 --> 00:18:57,953
um,
as conservatism has become more useless 

374
00:19:01,050 --> 00:19:02,270
to help those problems,
what,

375
00:19:02,420 --> 00:19:04,320
what has been left behind is an 
attitude.

376
00:19:04,650 --> 00:19:08,520
What conservatism I think means to most 
people say I'm a conservative because it

377
00:19:08,521 --> 00:19:10,440
means anti leftism.
Find out what the,

378
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:13,230
what the American left is talking about 
at any given moment,

379
00:19:14,010 --> 00:19:14,843
and not only think the opposite of it,
but actually make your opposition to 

380
00:19:19,471 --> 00:19:20,850
that.
That group of people,

381
00:19:21,540 --> 00:19:23,430
the organizing principle of your 
politics,

382
00:19:23,660 --> 00:19:26,520
you're sort of defining principle.
Basically you're defining principle.

383
00:19:26,550 --> 00:19:31,550
Now what that does is first it makes it,
does a couple things.

384
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:32,633
First,
it makes oppositionists it means you're 

385
00:19:34,081 --> 00:19:34,914
always against never four,
and the second thing it means is you 

386
00:19:37,291 --> 00:19:40,770
never have the initiative because you 
don't know what you think about anything

387
00:19:41,010 --> 00:19:41,843
until somebody else tells you first.
And I think that's one of the reasons 

388
00:19:44,491 --> 00:19:46,440
why conservatives were so vulnerable to 
trump,

389
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:47,753
is that you had an intellectual with 
state that was largely untended and 

390
00:19:54,990 --> 00:19:55,823
falling into disrepair,
and Donald trump came and kicked the 

391
00:19:57,841 --> 00:19:58,674
door down and moved in.
Were there any candidates that you like 

392
00:20:02,431 --> 00:20:06,370
that of that crew before trump came in 
and wreck the whole thing up?

393
00:20:06,390 --> 00:20:07,350
Look,
there've been a lot of,

394
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:08,290
uh,
I'm,

395
00:20:08,290 --> 00:20:11,300
I've almost always supported,
well until 2069,

396
00:20:11,301 --> 00:20:13,650
always supported the Republican nominee 
for president.

397
00:20:14,250 --> 00:20:16,350
And um,
I thought there were,

398
00:20:16,530 --> 00:20:17,363
there have been a lot of people who have
had real promise to make a good 

399
00:20:20,581 --> 00:20:22,470
president.
Mitt Romney would have made a very,

400
00:20:22,471 --> 00:20:23,340
very good president.

401
00:20:24,300 --> 00:20:26,790
Conservatism's problem.
A Republican isn't a problem,

402
00:20:26,791 --> 00:20:27,624
has been that you take people who are,
have real promise as leaders and you 

403
00:20:32,490 --> 00:20:37,490
then connect them to a program that 
can't win a democratic election.

404
00:20:38,090 --> 00:20:43,090
Know since the end of the Cold War.
Conservatives want the,

405
00:20:44,040 --> 00:20:44,873
the Republican nominee for president has
won a majority of the popular vote 

406
00:20:47,291 --> 00:20:51,220
exactly once and that was in 2004 in the
aftermath of nine slash 11.

407
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:52,100
Um,
it,

408
00:20:52,100 --> 00:20:52,933
it's no longer,
there's no longer a national majority 

409
00:20:55,030 --> 00:20:58,510
for what Republicans are offering and 
what has happened.

410
00:20:59,050 --> 00:21:01,350
And it's no surprise because when you're
saying,

411
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:02,193
well,
our big ideas to take the medicare 

412
00:21:03,101 --> 00:21:03,934
guarantee away from everybody under 55 
to put Medicaid on the path toward 

413
00:21:07,571 --> 00:21:08,404
extinction and to use all of that to 
finance more tax cuts like those that 

414
00:21:11,891 --> 00:21:12,724
worked in the 19 eighties in a 
completely different set of 

415
00:21:15,011 --> 00:21:19,240
circumstances that you're not talking to
or about me.

416
00:21:19,830 --> 00:21:20,663
I'm so good.
People have been committed to an 

417
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:27,820
unworkable program.
And what has happened then,

418
00:21:28,540 --> 00:21:32,260
um,
has been that as Republicans have lost,

419
00:21:32,261 --> 00:21:34,150
the parties become more desperate and 
more vulnerable.

420
00:21:34,420 --> 00:21:35,253
But what has also happened is that you 
have had an increasingly self-conscious 

421
00:21:38,410 --> 00:21:41,440
move and the conservative world,
and this is part of the trump ocracy,

422
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:44,470
we'll talk about in the book to say,
well,

423
00:21:44,950 --> 00:21:49,300
if we can't win a majority of the 
people,

424
00:21:50,230 --> 00:21:51,063
what we're going,
we're going to cope with that by 

425
00:21:52,721 --> 00:21:56,110
redefining who the proper people are.
And we're going to define the country.

426
00:21:56,290 --> 00:21:57,123
We're going to shrink our definition of 
who are the people and divide the 

427
00:21:59,441 --> 00:22:03,010
country between the people and those 
people and the p.

428
00:22:03,040 --> 00:22:05,970
and if we have a majority of the people,
that's all we care about and we're going

429
00:22:05,971 --> 00:22:06,804
to try to find ways to prevent those 
people from participating and even 

430
00:22:09,311 --> 00:22:10,090
voting.

431
00:22:10,090 --> 00:22:10,923
So a couple of things here.
So it's interesting you mentioned taxes 

432
00:22:12,441 --> 00:22:14,300
a couple of times and generally 
speaking,

433
00:22:14,301 --> 00:22:18,050
when I have conservative sit across from
me there for tax cuts no matter what.

434
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:18,913
And that's what you were saying,
that there was the 82 crew basically 

435
00:22:21,261 --> 00:22:22,094
that was born and then this fossil 
remained and people are always for it 

436
00:22:24,331 --> 00:22:25,120
now.
But it's,

437
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:27,560
it's rare to sit across from a 
conservative.

438
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:28,513
And you're basically saying that there 
are instances at least where the tax 

439
00:22:31,971 --> 00:22:33,110
cuts are not a problem.

440
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:33,740
Yeah.
But,

441
00:22:33,740 --> 00:22:36,510
but,
but one of the really damaging things,

442
00:22:36,670 --> 00:22:39,450
societies have states states need 
revenue.

443
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:40,920
Um,
so,

444
00:22:42,050 --> 00:22:44,130
um,
there are,

445
00:22:44,180 --> 00:22:45,330
there are things,
there are ways,

446
00:22:45,370 --> 00:22:47,280
you know,
the United States might not need so much

447
00:22:47,281 --> 00:22:49,830
tax money if,
for example,

448
00:22:49,900 --> 00:22:50,733
um,
it didn't spend twice as twice as much 

449
00:22:52,801 --> 00:22:56,370
per person on healthcare as everybody 
else in the world.

450
00:22:56,371 --> 00:22:58,790
When you look at the actual dollars 
United States spends on,

451
00:22:59,050 --> 00:23:01,680
on pro health provision for terrible 
results,

452
00:23:01,970 --> 00:23:03,000
um,
it's very expensive.

453
00:23:03,420 --> 00:23:04,253
Um,
conservatives by and large are not 

454
00:23:05,370 --> 00:23:07,680
interested in getting their fingers into
that problem.

455
00:23:08,230 --> 00:23:09,063
They're not.
So the government needs revenue and it 

456
00:23:12,061 --> 00:23:15,600
has to be funded and part of the 
fossilization happens.

457
00:23:15,710 --> 00:23:16,980
Conservative.
Say you say,

458
00:23:17,040 --> 00:23:19,830
we've got a problem.
I'm whatever it is.

459
00:23:20,700 --> 00:23:21,540
And the concern,
well,

460
00:23:21,810 --> 00:23:25,080
if I can solve it with a tax cut,
then I'm for doing something.

461
00:23:25,170 --> 00:23:29,220
If I can only solve it by having a 
spending increase of that,

462
00:23:29,221 --> 00:23:30,054
I won't do anything.

463
00:23:30,270 --> 00:23:32,520
What then happens is cynical operators 
say,

464
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:33,873
what if we take our spending increase 
and instead of doing it through an 

465
00:23:38,551 --> 00:23:40,860
appropriation,
we do it through a tax credit.

466
00:23:41,670 --> 00:23:42,600
How do you feel that?
Oh,

467
00:23:42,601 --> 00:23:43,434
then I'm fine.
And the result is that wasn't the 

468
00:23:46,671 --> 00:23:50,690
problem is housing or higher education 
or caring for disabled children,

469
00:23:51,140 --> 00:23:55,910
that conservatives can be sold a 
solution in the form of a tax credit,

470
00:23:56,210 --> 00:24:01,160
which is usually the least efficient way
of solving a problem.

471
00:24:01,450 --> 00:24:05,120
Um,
and the result is that you get this kind

472
00:24:05,121 --> 00:24:05,954
of malformed state where the United 
States has a really big and expensive 

473
00:24:09,021 --> 00:24:09,854
government,
but it's financed and especially in 

474
00:24:11,271 --> 00:24:14,300
efficient ways and it addresses problems
and especially inefficient ways.

475
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:18,440
So is the first part there though that 
nobody actually cut spending,

476
00:24:18,441 --> 00:24:19,274
you know,
I've had Ben Shapiro in here a bunch of 

477
00:24:20,181 --> 00:24:21,014
times and that's what he talks about it,
that we can keep raising taxes forever 

478
00:24:23,481 --> 00:24:24,314
and ever and ever.
But that really we have this just giant 

479
00:24:27,021 --> 00:24:30,350
monstrosity of a government that's 
incredibly inefficient.

480
00:24:30,351 --> 00:24:32,270
I mean even healthcare side,
just everything,

481
00:24:32,271 --> 00:24:37,271
all the mid level bureaus and regulators
and just this massive federal government

482
00:24:37,761 --> 00:24:38,594
that was never supposed to get so big 
that we never actually really look at 

483
00:24:42,020 --> 00:24:45,710
how much of that we could chop away at 
were then if we did a little of that,

484
00:24:45,711 --> 00:24:48,650
we could have the,
the sort of relevant conversations about

485
00:24:48,651 --> 00:24:49,850
tax cuts that you're talking about.

486
00:24:49,900 --> 00:24:54,900
Well that's partly true and partly not 
the United States.

487
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:56,273
Uh,
what is the government spend its money 

488
00:24:58,391 --> 00:25:02,800
on defense,
Medicare,

489
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:05,680
Medicaid,
social security.

490
00:25:05,920 --> 00:25:09,040
I think that's those things together.
I think that's about 80 percent.

491
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:11,230
Um,
so,

492
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:13,750
uh,
the rest of the government,

493
00:25:14,010 --> 00:25:14,710
you know,
is,

494
00:25:14,710 --> 00:25:15,550
uh,
I mean,

495
00:25:15,700 --> 00:25:17,440
I think it's true that dollar for 
dollar,

496
00:25:17,441 --> 00:25:20,980
the US government is less efficient than
that of other countries.

497
00:25:21,210 --> 00:25:23,770
Um,
mostly because of the inheritance of not

498
00:25:23,771 --> 00:25:24,604
having a proper civil service that I'm,
the idea that president starts off by 

499
00:25:27,591 --> 00:25:30,370
appointing the top 10,000
jobs in the civil service.

500
00:25:30,630 --> 00:25:31,463
So it's highly political and you get a 
lot of people who shouldn't basically 

501
00:25:34,060 --> 00:25:37,720
have no background in government,
don't know what they're doing and things

502
00:25:37,721 --> 00:25:39,700
are not done in a very efficient way.
Also,

503
00:25:39,701 --> 00:25:40,534
the power of Congress means there are a 
lot of people were always trying to put 

504
00:25:43,901 --> 00:25:46,220
in some special benefit and things 
happen that don't make.

505
00:25:46,360 --> 00:25:48,850
So you have military bases in places 
where they shouldn't be.

506
00:25:50,290 --> 00:25:52,140
But if you were,
this is,

507
00:25:52,150 --> 00:25:56,900
this is why I say conservatism is 
obsolete if you want to reduce the state

508
00:25:56,901 --> 00:25:58,150
share of expense.
And really,

509
00:25:58,210 --> 00:26:02,740
I mean not just by repackaging things as
tax that are,

510
00:26:03,180 --> 00:26:04,230
you know,
that um,

511
00:26:04,300 --> 00:26:05,320
I mean,
one of the ways we,

512
00:26:05,321 --> 00:26:06,154
for example,
fund the care of disabled children is 

513
00:26:08,711 --> 00:26:09,544
through a series of tax credits that are
not labeled as expenditures but really 

514
00:26:13,421 --> 00:26:16,510
are,
you have to do something by Medicare and

515
00:26:16,511 --> 00:26:17,820
Medicaid.
And so the conservative,

516
00:26:17,821 --> 00:26:18,910
the idea has been,
okay,

517
00:26:18,911 --> 00:26:19,744
well the answer is we're going to take 
away Medicare and Medicaid from people 

518
00:26:23,320 --> 00:26:24,153
and the reason that the Obama period has
been such a crisis and the period 

519
00:26:27,311 --> 00:26:28,144
afterwards is the defeat over the defeat
of the conservative attempt to repeal 

520
00:26:33,851 --> 00:26:34,684
the affordable care act.
And to pass the Ryan plan means the 

521
00:26:37,781 --> 00:26:38,614
conservatives have to face a world in 
which the United States has joined the 

522
00:26:41,231 --> 00:26:42,064
other developed countries and having 
something like or something closer to a 

523
00:26:45,301 --> 00:26:46,740
universal healthcare guarantee.

524
00:26:46,770 --> 00:26:47,603
The old idea,
we'll save money just by not covering 

525
00:26:49,441 --> 00:26:50,274
people.
That is not going to be workable in the 

526
00:26:53,101 --> 00:26:53,934
politics of the 21st century.
So that means you have to actually pay 

527
00:26:57,151 --> 00:26:57,984
attention to how Medicare works.
And you have to say how while covering 

528
00:27:00,331 --> 00:27:04,770
everybody do we squeeze costs out of the
system and that requires a commitment to

529
00:27:04,771 --> 00:27:05,604
policy detail that conservatives don't 
like to do is they like the sweeping 

530
00:27:08,430 --> 00:27:10,170
comment.
We just need to cut all this waste.

531
00:27:11,190 --> 00:27:14,790
But the,
when you say,

532
00:27:14,791 --> 00:27:16,530
well,
where is the waste of Medicare?

533
00:27:16,531 --> 00:27:17,131
Well,
the answer is,

534
00:27:17,131 --> 00:27:18,690
would the United States,
um,

535
00:27:18,810 --> 00:27:22,620
overpays for all of these services,
um,

536
00:27:23,490 --> 00:27:24,690
per unit,
um,

537
00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:25,673
and uh,
doctors make more money in the United 

538
00:27:27,420 --> 00:27:30,460
States than they do in other places.
You have a,

539
00:27:30,510 --> 00:27:31,610
you have these,
um,

540
00:27:32,390 --> 00:27:33,223
uh,
but you also have this problem if you 

541
00:27:34,171 --> 00:27:37,230
have a sicker population than not people
do in other countries.

542
00:27:37,231 --> 00:27:40,320
Americans die earlier.
They're less likely to wear seatbelts.

543
00:27:40,460 --> 00:27:42,180
Um,
they have more gun accidents.

544
00:27:42,390 --> 00:27:43,223
Uh,
you have to delve to deal with this 

545
00:27:44,971 --> 00:27:45,804
problem.
You have to delve into detail in a way 

546
00:27:46,741 --> 00:27:47,574
that the conservative preference for 
ideology over factual specificity makes 

547
00:27:52,471 --> 00:27:53,940
conservatives not very useful at.

548
00:27:54,110 --> 00:27:56,630
Is anyone good at that these days 
though?

549
00:27:56,780 --> 00:28:00,050
Really like really saying,
look,

550
00:28:00,051 --> 00:28:02,810
if you look at the real grass root 
movement on both sides,

551
00:28:02,811 --> 00:28:05,700
I mean Bernie was pretty extreme left 
and trump was w,

552
00:28:05,701 --> 00:28:07,580
whatever I can,
it's hard to call extreme right,

553
00:28:07,730 --> 00:28:09,560
but what we'll get into that,
whatever you call that,

554
00:28:09,590 --> 00:28:11,510
that you know,
just the wrecking of the system.

555
00:28:11,511 --> 00:28:13,180
So you had these two competing forces.

556
00:28:13,230 --> 00:28:14,063
Look,
we have a lot of political messianism 

557
00:28:14,830 --> 00:28:18,720
that's a really important point.
But here I'm here.

558
00:28:18,750 --> 00:28:20,990
Let me put a set of looking at what at 
the two sides.

559
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:22,193
If you were to take the 5,000
people in the United States who know 

560
00:28:25,291 --> 00:28:28,620
most about Medicare and Medicaid are the
hundred who know most about Medicare and

561
00:28:28,621 --> 00:28:33,621
Medicaid.
I'm guessing 90 of the hundred and 9,990

562
00:28:34,020 --> 00:28:37,230
of the thousand,
maybe not 900,000

563
00:28:37,470 --> 00:28:38,303
would be people of the center left 
because conservatives just don't care 

564
00:28:43,620 --> 00:28:46,860
about that kind of knowledge.
And so they're always at a disadvantage.

565
00:28:46,920 --> 00:28:47,753
So is it that they don't care,
they just don't think the government 

566
00:28:49,381 --> 00:28:53,130
should be involved in it like that.
The fundamental worst.

567
00:28:53,190 --> 00:28:53,740
Well,
okay,

568
00:28:53,740 --> 00:28:54,573
is that,
it's not the job of the government 

569
00:28:55,651 --> 00:28:56,080
really,

570
00:28:56,080 --> 00:28:56,913
but they know,
so every once in a while somebody will 

571
00:28:58,721 --> 00:28:59,554
put his head above the parapet and say,
I don't think the government should be 

572
00:29:01,061 --> 00:29:02,590
providing healthcare for everybody.
Right?

573
00:29:03,040 --> 00:29:03,873
You lose an election that,
that is how Donald Trump became the 

574
00:29:05,831 --> 00:29:07,000
republican nominee.
That's right.

575
00:29:07,001 --> 00:29:10,540
Paul Ryan does not think the government 
should provide healthcare to everybody.

576
00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:14,800
The problem is the Republican primary 
voter thinks the gut.

577
00:29:14,801 --> 00:29:16,030
Well,
the government should provide healthcare

578
00:29:16,031 --> 00:29:16,864
to everybody,
but they should provide healthcare to 

579
00:29:19,270 --> 00:29:21,330
everyone like me.
Um,

580
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:22,530
so,
uh,

581
00:29:22,690 --> 00:29:23,523
yes,
they should provide healthcare to all 

582
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:24,673
the over 65.
They should provide healthcare to all 

583
00:29:26,171 --> 00:29:28,300
the veterans.
But once you do that,

584
00:29:28,301 --> 00:29:31,090
you're into a very big program.
And once you're saying government should

585
00:29:31,091 --> 00:29:31,924
provide healthcare to all the over 65.
So that's where most of the spending 

586
00:29:34,301 --> 00:29:36,240
takes place anyway.
So

587
00:29:36,440 --> 00:29:37,273
nuclear,
you have an ideological difference with 

588
00:29:38,211 --> 00:29:39,044
maybe the Paul Ryan approach,
but you think it's a legitimate of 

589
00:29:41,621 --> 00:29:42,040
looking at the

590
00:29:42,040 --> 00:29:42,873
government,
right?

591
00:29:43,810 --> 00:29:45,610
It's,
I don't want to put words in your mouth,

592
00:29:45,611 --> 00:29:48,040
but I don't understand what that is.
It's a way to think,

593
00:29:48,070 --> 00:29:48,903
yeah,
for sure.

594
00:29:49,170 --> 00:29:50,560
Um,
you could argue that point,

595
00:29:50,590 --> 00:29:51,423
but it's not a way that a political 
party wants to compete for power in the 

596
00:29:56,470 --> 00:29:58,750
United States can think because the 
voters won't accept it.

597
00:29:59,170 --> 00:30:03,850
So what ends up happening is that the 
Republicans have a bunch of commitment,

598
00:30:03,940 --> 00:30:04,773
they have a bunch of theoretical 
commitments and a bunch of operational 

599
00:30:07,601 --> 00:30:10,900
commitments and those,
they don't line up,

600
00:30:11,170 --> 00:30:12,003
uh,
and in fact the Republican Party does 

601
00:30:14,681 --> 00:30:15,514
maintain Medicare.
It does make maintain medicaid and it 

602
00:30:17,641 --> 00:30:20,560
tries to find little economies usually 
not very efficient ways,

603
00:30:21,730 --> 00:30:22,563
but the result is because it doesn't 
care about how those problems work and 

604
00:30:24,530 --> 00:30:28,340
it's not psychically committed to them.
There is no one there saying we're going

605
00:30:28,341 --> 00:30:29,174
to cut.
We're going to.

606
00:30:29,350 --> 00:30:32,470
How is it that Germany and France and 
Switzerland,

607
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:34,120
the Netherlands,
Canada,

608
00:30:34,660 --> 00:30:35,493
um,
cover more people have longer life 

609
00:30:38,651 --> 00:30:40,270
expectancies and spend less.

610
00:30:40,710 --> 00:30:41,460
Um,
you know,

611
00:30:41,460 --> 00:30:42,293
the difference between what the United 
States spends the difference of the 

612
00:30:47,021 --> 00:30:47,854
American spending,
the American economy and healthcare and 

613
00:30:49,631 --> 00:30:51,790
that of the other developed countries.
It's about three,

614
00:30:51,910 --> 00:30:54,850
three or four points of GDP,
which is bigger than the defense budget.

615
00:30:56,170 --> 00:30:57,880
So what does that say then,
just about.

616
00:30:58,210 --> 00:30:59,980
We don't even have to make this about 
conservative per se.

617
00:30:59,981 --> 00:31:02,410
What does that say about our system?
If a guy came up,

618
00:31:02,470 --> 00:31:06,400
let's say a Republican nominee came up 
and really was talking about that.

619
00:31:06,830 --> 00:31:08,500
I talk that the,
the ins and outs.

620
00:31:08,650 --> 00:31:09,700
I mean,
no matter what,

621
00:31:09,730 --> 00:31:11,200
let's just look at 2016.
I mean,

622
00:31:11,201 --> 00:31:12,034
he would have been clubbed over the head
by trauma and they still the trump 

623
00:31:15,041 --> 00:31:18,830
campaign.
Trump said trump is a.

624
00:31:19,060 --> 00:31:20,710
was a great disco.
Trump.

625
00:31:20,711 --> 00:31:23,800
This is what I mean by the hollowness.
So trump set,

626
00:31:24,190 --> 00:31:25,023
I'm going to protect Medicare.
I'm going to protect Medicaid trump 

627
00:31:27,671 --> 00:31:29,920
campaign as the guy who's going to.

628
00:31:30,070 --> 00:31:30,903
Who was the first Republican who really 
made his peace with the American social 

629
00:31:35,201 --> 00:31:36,034
insurance system.
When conservatives said trump wasn't a 

630
00:31:37,541 --> 00:31:38,374
conservative,
they were right and that's why he beat 

631
00:31:40,901 --> 00:31:41,734
them inside their own party.
Trump begins by beating the republican 

632
00:31:45,490 --> 00:31:46,270
world.
He'd been.

633
00:31:46,270 --> 00:31:49,810
He begins by defeating Fox News and 
bending all of them to his will.

634
00:31:50,020 --> 00:31:52,060
Now he had no idea what he was talking 
about.

635
00:31:52,420 --> 00:31:54,700
He had no plan for executing any of 
this,

636
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:55,833
but he do.
You think that's really true because I 

637
00:31:56,891 --> 00:31:57,724
hear this with a lot of people that he 
had either no idea what he was doing or 

638
00:32:00,690 --> 00:32:04,480
no plan or anything.
Someone who has no idea.

639
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:06,910
He reveals that every day he doesn't 
know.

640
00:32:06,940 --> 00:32:10,450
He doesn't understand,
but what does that say about all of us?

641
00:32:10,610 --> 00:32:12,790
That's true.
Like if one of the.

642
00:32:13,270 --> 00:32:16,270
One of the interviewers had said during 
that Mr Trump,

643
00:32:16,780 --> 00:32:19,330
you say you're going to preserve 
Medicare and Medicaid.

644
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:23,920
What does Medicare do and what does 
Medicaid do and what's the difference?

645
00:32:24,280 --> 00:32:25,113
I will bet you I'm the amount of money 
the Republican Party are going to 

646
00:32:30,370 --> 00:32:32,260
corruptly put in his pockets of Maro 
Lago,

647
00:32:32,380 --> 00:32:33,850
but he couldn't have answered that 
question.

648
00:32:33,880 --> 00:32:34,481
Yeah,
so that.

649
00:32:34,481 --> 00:32:37,000
I completely agree with that.
I did a video before the election saying

650
00:32:37,001 --> 00:32:40,190
if you want to stump trump asking him 
what the three branches of government

651
00:32:40,190 --> 00:32:41,023
are and what they're supposed to do.
He was asked what the three elements of 

652
00:32:43,671 --> 00:32:44,770
the nuclear triad.
Okay.

653
00:32:44,820 --> 00:32:46,910
You didn't know that,
so that kind of stuff.

654
00:32:46,911 --> 00:32:48,640
I do agree,
but this thing about sort of,

655
00:32:48,680 --> 00:32:51,860
there was no plan.
There's no point in some way.

656
00:32:51,920 --> 00:32:54,620
Even if even if I can intellectually get
there with you,

657
00:32:54,621 --> 00:32:57,900
there's something about that idea that 
then he duped by me.

658
00:32:57,980 --> 00:33:00,470
It's scary.
I guess I would say it's pretty scary to

659
00:33:00,471 --> 00:33:04,850
think that someone who had no plan dupe 
the rest of us like that,

660
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:08,180
that inherently seems like a planet at 
some level because we're sort of talking

661
00:33:08,181 --> 00:33:09,200
about plans at different levels.

662
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:10,033
Well,
Don Donald trump is one of the great 

663
00:33:10,701 --> 00:33:13,790
scam artists of all time.
He scammed the people trump university.

664
00:33:14,570 --> 00:33:15,403
He and the scan was possible because of 
the disillusionment of so many people 

665
00:33:20,390 --> 00:33:24,790
with a responsible politics.
But what,

666
00:33:24,910 --> 00:33:26,130
when he intuited,
I mean,

667
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:32,270
I mean he's not,
that he dumped trump has certain talents

668
00:33:32,271 --> 00:33:33,390
and geniuses.
Um,

669
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:34,273
he,
he is a genius at finding the weakness 

670
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:36,913
in things.
And he understood the weakness in the 

671
00:33:38,431 --> 00:33:39,264
institutional Republican Party,
which is that they were offering a 

672
00:33:41,601 --> 00:33:42,434
message that their own voters hate it.
And I have a lot of detail on that in 

673
00:33:45,561 --> 00:33:49,100
the book about how when you actually 
showed Republican voters,

674
00:33:49,130 --> 00:33:51,680
Republican primary voters,
what Paul Ryan wanted to do,

675
00:33:52,020 --> 00:33:56,210
we just recoiled from it,
but he's gonna take away my medicare,

676
00:33:56,211 --> 00:33:57,890
he's going to take away my mother's 
nursing home.

677
00:33:58,010 --> 00:34:00,170
That's the plan.
That's the famous Ryan plant.

678
00:34:01,430 --> 00:34:05,750
So Donald Trump understood that.
That and what he then understood as well

679
00:34:05,930 --> 00:34:10,930
was that in the absence of a program 
that this anti leftism that can become a

680
00:34:11,421 --> 00:34:12,254
conservative conservatism was this was a
series of resentments and rages that 

681
00:34:15,231 --> 00:34:17,720
we're waiting for somebody who could 
articulate who,

682
00:34:17,900 --> 00:34:22,850
who raged and presented as powerfully as
they did.

683
00:34:22,880 --> 00:34:23,713
I mean Republicans,
the previous Republican nominees with 

684
00:34:28,010 --> 00:34:31,700
sometimes tap these feelings trying to 
channel them,

685
00:34:31,910 --> 00:34:34,730
but they didn't share them.
Donald trump shares them.

686
00:34:35,180 --> 00:34:37,300
Okay.
So before we go fully into drop and then

687
00:34:37,301 --> 00:34:39,200
we're going to spend the rest of the 
interview on trump.

688
00:34:39,350 --> 00:34:43,730
I just wanna talk a little bit about the
modern Democrats and the left in general

689
00:34:43,731 --> 00:34:45,490
and all that.
So what do you make of the,

690
00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:49,970
the feeling that he was going for?
I think that's a pretty legit feeling on

691
00:34:49,971 --> 00:34:53,510
what's happened with the left related to
free speech and the endless hysteria and

692
00:34:53,511 --> 00:34:55,400
everyone's a bigot and a racist and 
identity,

693
00:34:55,401 --> 00:34:56,750
politics,
all of that.

694
00:34:56,751 --> 00:35:00,270
That feeling I think is legit.
Um,

695
00:35:00,410 --> 00:35:04,070
do you see that as a legit feeling?
Um,

696
00:35:05,120 --> 00:35:07,400
but in our group therapy that feelings 
are legitimate.

697
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:10,220
The question is,
are not even feeling.

698
00:35:10,221 --> 00:35:11,054
I see it as a legit reality.
The thing that he was talking about 

699
00:35:12,861 --> 00:35:14,210
there is a legit reality.

700
00:35:14,290 --> 00:35:15,123
Um,
I will take this w what behind behind 

701
00:35:18,130 --> 00:35:22,120
all of those things you described is a 
new fact and the politics,

702
00:35:22,130 --> 00:35:24,100
the United States in the past 15,
20 years,

703
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:25,553
um,
which is that we are moving into a 

704
00:35:27,401 --> 00:35:31,780
period of intense intensifying ethnic 
competition for power,

705
00:35:31,990 --> 00:35:34,070
for money.
And for the right to say that,

706
00:35:34,150 --> 00:35:34,983
what to talk about,
to define what it means to be an 

707
00:35:36,191 --> 00:35:37,024
American.
And the country's made this big gamble 

708
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:45,330
on changing itself.
And across the developed world,

709
00:35:45,720 --> 00:35:48,060
countries like the United States have 
made similar gambles.

710
00:35:48,290 --> 00:35:49,123
Um,
the proportion of the foreign born in 

711
00:35:50,431 --> 00:35:52,440
Sweden is now as high as in the United 
States.

712
00:35:52,441 --> 00:35:53,274
The proportion of foreign born in 
Germany's nearly as high as in the 

713
00:35:55,530 --> 00:35:56,363
United States that are having massive 
problems with their all immigration is 

714
00:35:59,840 --> 00:36:02,100
always a source of massive social 
tension.

715
00:36:02,220 --> 00:36:03,053
And um,
we do a lot of the immigration happened 

716
00:36:05,161 --> 00:36:05,994
without anybody ever consciously 
intending it and without much of a 

717
00:36:08,821 --> 00:36:09,930
debate over it.

718
00:36:10,260 --> 00:36:11,093
And with a refusal to tally costs and 
benefits in an accurate way so these 

719
00:36:16,381 --> 00:36:17,214
countries have been changed.
And what you have is then a series of 

720
00:36:20,010 --> 00:36:25,010
new demands and new resentments.
And that's one of the,

721
00:36:25,860 --> 00:36:26,693
one of the reasons that the conservatism
I grew up with the so out of date is 

722
00:36:29,470 --> 00:36:30,303
look back in 1985.
The argument between Liberals and 

723
00:36:32,401 --> 00:36:36,630
conservatives was basically an argument 
about the economy that,

724
00:36:36,990 --> 00:36:39,390
uh,
and this is true,

725
00:36:39,391 --> 00:36:41,220
not just in every developed country we'd
have,

726
00:36:41,270 --> 00:36:42,103
you had a party of the people who worked
for wages and the party of the people 

727
00:36:45,031 --> 00:36:47,180
who own capital assets and work for 
salads.

728
00:36:48,090 --> 00:36:51,060
The left were the people who,
whose jobs are supported by taxes.

729
00:36:51,061 --> 00:36:53,300
The other people's jobs are supported by
profits.

730
00:36:53,630 --> 00:36:55,080
If you're in management,
you were on the right.

731
00:36:55,081 --> 00:36:56,670
If you are in a union,
you are on the left,

732
00:36:56,750 --> 00:37:01,020
I'm not to sound sexist about this,
but essentially your relationship to the

733
00:37:01,021 --> 00:37:01,854
means of production was the,
was this the organizing principle of 

734
00:37:05,491 --> 00:37:06,324
politics?

735
00:37:06,780 --> 00:37:07,613
What also happened in 1995 was it people
remembered that this kind of politics 

736
00:37:12,031 --> 00:37:15,310
could spiral out of control and they'd 
seen it happened in the 19 thirties and,

737
00:37:15,510 --> 00:37:17,730
and uh,
you could get fascist movements,

738
00:37:17,731 --> 00:37:22,380
you could get communist movements.
And so there were attempts to temper the

739
00:37:22,381 --> 00:37:25,650
competition between the wage people in 
the salary people between the owners and

740
00:37:25,651 --> 00:37:26,700
the workers.
Um,

741
00:37:26,701 --> 00:37:27,534
that's,
uh,

742
00:37:27,660 --> 00:37:30,380
and so you had the,
you had kind of a continent.

743
00:37:30,420 --> 00:37:31,253
The left accepted a market economy and 
the right excepted to social insurance 

744
00:37:34,111 --> 00:37:36,060
state,
but that's what the argument was about.

745
00:37:37,110 --> 00:37:39,630
And that's what we've run on now for 
quite some time.

746
00:37:39,750 --> 00:37:43,080
But that has ceased with the collapse of
socialism.

747
00:37:43,260 --> 00:37:46,060
That argument ended.
Um,

748
00:37:46,250 --> 00:37:47,083
the,
the modern left is not really a 

749
00:37:49,141 --> 00:37:50,530
socialist movement anymore.
There,

750
00:37:50,630 --> 00:37:53,010
I mean people will sometimes use the 
word they will have,

751
00:37:53,011 --> 00:37:53,844
but I mean back in 1950 there are people
who really thought that if the 

752
00:37:57,841 --> 00:37:58,674
government owned the banks,
the banks would make better lending 

753
00:38:00,811 --> 00:38:02,370
decisions than they did.

754
00:38:02,830 --> 00:38:05,310
Then they would have their private.
No one thinks that now.

755
00:38:05,311 --> 00:38:06,270
I mean,
I don't even think really.

756
00:38:06,310 --> 00:38:07,143
You don't think that there's plenty of 
people on the left that we'll just sort 

757
00:38:10,471 --> 00:38:11,304
of incrementally get there.
They get 330 million people in the 

758
00:38:13,590 --> 00:38:14,520
United States,
so somebody who thinks every.

759
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:16,290
I don't even know him,
but I mean that if that.

760
00:38:16,291 --> 00:38:18,500
If Bernie was president,
that eventually the EU.

761
00:38:18,510 --> 00:38:20,880
I think the creeping movement of this.
Yeah.

762
00:38:20,881 --> 00:38:22,800
Elizabeth Warren,
that do they want to movement?

763
00:38:22,860 --> 00:38:25,170
I think Elizabeth Warren does not want 
the government to own the banks.

764
00:38:25,171 --> 00:38:26,004
No,
I don't think she.

765
00:38:26,010 --> 00:38:26,843
I believe that Elizabeth Warren is not.
The government should own the steel 

766
00:38:28,861 --> 00:38:29,694
companies.
She doesn't believe that government 

767
00:38:30,451 --> 00:38:33,060
should own the commanding heights of 
industry.

768
00:38:33,061 --> 00:38:35,130
I'm sure she does not bladder that.
I don't know about owning,

769
00:38:35,230 --> 00:38:36,063
but what about just controlling it to 
the point where in effect it's 

770
00:38:38,110 --> 00:38:38,590
ownership.

771
00:38:38,590 --> 00:38:39,370
I know,
I know you.

772
00:38:39,370 --> 00:38:40,203
I know she thinks.
I don't think she thinks they should 

773
00:38:41,831 --> 00:38:42,670
manage it.
Um,

774
00:38:43,180 --> 00:38:45,970
uh,
she believes in a social market economy.

775
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:46,833
I mean,
if you were to say to her what is the 

776
00:38:47,501 --> 00:38:50,040
best run country on earth?
She bringing,

777
00:38:50,120 --> 00:38:52,030
always used to say Denmark was the best 
one country.

778
00:38:52,210 --> 00:38:53,043
Denmark is a free market society.
It's got a bigger social insurance 

779
00:38:55,331 --> 00:38:56,164
system in the United States.
And he said that because the reason he 

780
00:38:58,511 --> 00:39:01,720
said that was it was never serious 
answer because he didn't stop caring.

781
00:39:02,110 --> 00:39:07,110
But that's not what politics is about.
What politics is about is in 1985.

782
00:39:07,990 --> 00:39:08,823
If I knew how you made your living,
I could probably guess how you voted 

783
00:39:12,670 --> 00:39:13,503
today.
If I know where your grandparents come 

784
00:39:16,121 --> 00:39:17,590
from.
I know how you vote.

785
00:39:17,680 --> 00:39:20,980
So if your grandparents did not belong 
to the local ethnic majority,

786
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:22,990
whether in the United States or Germany 
or Britain,

787
00:39:22,991 --> 00:39:24,070
you are in the party.

788
00:39:24,070 --> 00:39:27,610
What used to be the lift if your 
grandparents do belong,

789
00:39:27,790 --> 00:39:28,481
did,
do,

790
00:39:28,481 --> 00:39:30,540
or did belong to the local ethnic 
majority of your,

791
00:39:30,610 --> 00:39:32,890
what is the power of Party of the right 
Houston?

792
00:39:33,250 --> 00:39:34,083
And that's true,
however you make your living however 

793
00:39:35,591 --> 00:39:39,160
much or little money you have,
and that was not true in former days.

794
00:39:39,430 --> 00:39:40,263
So you have this politics of ethnic 
competition and that's why politics as 

795
00:39:43,511 --> 00:39:44,770
one,
the reason why politics are so much more

796
00:39:44,771 --> 00:39:48,880
very long because in the end you with 
money,

797
00:39:48,881 --> 00:39:51,220
you can always split the difference 
somewhere.

798
00:39:51,221 --> 00:39:53,710
We say,
will you take 20 percent?

799
00:39:53,740 --> 00:39:55,660
No.
Will you take 23 percent when?

800
00:39:55,750 --> 00:39:56,920
Oh,
28 percent.

801
00:39:56,921 --> 00:39:57,910
Okay,
we have a deal.

802
00:39:58,930 --> 00:40:02,320
But when you're competing,
what does it mean to be an American?

803
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:07,050
We haven't.
Who gets to define Americanness?

804
00:40:07,370 --> 00:40:08,203
Um,
we haven't found a way to split the 

805
00:40:10,001 --> 00:40:11,950
difference on that.
And until we do,

806
00:40:11,951 --> 00:40:13,270
we're going to have very,
very little politics.

807
00:40:13,270 --> 00:40:14,103
I mean,
there's this,

808
00:40:14,440 --> 00:40:15,273
you know,
when,

809
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:16,113
when the Sarah payloads and others talk 
about what it means to be a real 

810
00:40:19,241 --> 00:40:21,280
American and some things,
a real American,

811
00:40:21,281 --> 00:40:22,114
other things are not looking for a way 
to claim ethnic legitimation that we 

812
00:40:28,331 --> 00:40:30,310
get.
We may not have the numbers anymore,

813
00:40:30,311 --> 00:40:33,460
but we still define the country and that
is one of the things that's going on.

814
00:40:33,730 --> 00:40:35,770
That's what these political correctness 
battles are all about.

815
00:40:36,490 --> 00:40:36,830
I mean,
it's,

816
00:40:36,830 --> 00:40:38,840
it's always true,
um,

817
00:40:39,240 --> 00:40:40,073
that there are things people don't say.
They're always things that people don't 

818
00:40:42,821 --> 00:40:43,654
say.
Even if they're free to set their 

819
00:40:44,350 --> 00:40:45,183
things,
they don't say,

820
00:40:46,300 --> 00:40:47,133
how does that happen though?
There things that you don't say and who 

821
00:40:49,541 --> 00:40:50,374
gets to decide.
And that's what we're struggling over 

822
00:40:52,391 --> 00:40:55,110
the people,
what we're calling political correctness

823
00:40:55,111 --> 00:40:57,190
as people saying.
There used to be a set of rules,

824
00:40:57,200 --> 00:40:58,360
a of taboos.

825
00:40:58,990 --> 00:41:02,410
We have a new set of tools.
We want the old taboos to be unto Bu and

826
00:41:02,411 --> 00:41:03,244
we want to impose the new Tibu and the 
people on the receiving end of that say 

827
00:41:05,681 --> 00:41:08,560
we like our old taboos and we don't want
these new taboos.

828
00:41:08,590 --> 00:41:09,423
And that,
that's where Donald Trump is coming 

829
00:41:12,041 --> 00:41:12,874
from.
I'm an,

830
00:41:13,300 --> 00:41:15,310
if that's a real dispute is,
it's important,

831
00:41:15,311 --> 00:41:18,910
but it's new and it's dangerous and we 
don't know how to manage it.

832
00:41:19,030 --> 00:41:23,350
And we have this deeply opportunistic 
actor who's taking advantage of it.

833
00:41:23,560 --> 00:41:25,540
Okay.
So before we fully dive into that then,

834
00:41:25,541 --> 00:41:29,350
what does this show you that our,
our brand of multiculturalism,

835
00:41:29,351 --> 00:41:32,470
which has worked better than virtually 
any state,

836
00:41:32,471 --> 00:41:33,710
you know,
European state

837
00:41:34,010 --> 00:41:34,843
are our melting pot.
Does this tell you that the experiment 

838
00:41:37,341 --> 00:41:38,630
is starting to fail?
I mean,

839
00:41:38,631 --> 00:41:41,360
is this the litmus test for that?
Well,

840
00:41:41,370 --> 00:41:43,580
you know,
because that's what it sounds like.

841
00:41:43,640 --> 00:41:44,473
First American melting pot never worked 
as well as Americans told themselves it 

842
00:41:47,811 --> 00:41:49,610
did in other states.

843
00:41:50,280 --> 00:41:53,070
I'm,
uh,

844
00:41:53,690 --> 00:41:54,523
has had a lot of civic conflict and its 
history and not just the civil war and 

845
00:41:58,761 --> 00:41:59,594
then later 19th century to the most 
violent labor relations anywhere on 

846
00:42:02,781 --> 00:42:03,614
earth.
And those were often about ethnicity 

847
00:42:04,700 --> 00:42:05,533
that the strykers would be from one 
group and the police police who shot 

848
00:42:09,891 --> 00:42:14,440
them would be from a different group.
And the strikes will be broken by strike

849
00:42:14,441 --> 00:42:16,520
breakers who are from a third group yet 
again,

850
00:42:17,260 --> 00:42:18,093
um,
but multiculturalism is difficult to do 

851
00:42:21,080 --> 00:42:21,913
and it's especially difficult to do when
you have moved out of the age of mass 

852
00:42:24,351 --> 00:42:26,600
production and was one thing when you're
bringing in,

853
00:42:26,780 --> 00:42:29,600
you needed a lot of bodies to run a 
modern economy.

854
00:42:30,230 --> 00:42:34,040
You don't need so many bodies today.
And uh,

855
00:42:34,600 --> 00:42:38,060
and we also live in a world in which 
whereas before,

856
00:42:38,810 --> 00:42:41,090
um,
there were a lot of pretty average sized

857
00:42:41,091 --> 00:42:41,924
rewards today.
We live in a world in which there are 

858
00:42:44,180 --> 00:42:47,720
gigantic rewards and not such great 
rewards.

859
00:42:47,780 --> 00:42:48,613
And the average,
what the average person gets is not as 

860
00:42:50,601 --> 00:42:54,530
attractive relatively speaking as it was
two generations ago.

861
00:42:54,980 --> 00:42:56,080
All right,
let's do it.

862
00:42:56,081 --> 00:42:59,160
Let's dive into this trump guy because I
sense that everything we've talked about

863
00:42:59,180 --> 00:43:00,013
for the first half year,
a lot of your answers now are sort of 

864
00:43:02,141 --> 00:43:06,380
directly related to this guy who saw the
weakness but not to the

865
00:43:06,420 --> 00:43:08,850
personality of this guy,
but to the whole system.

866
00:43:08,970 --> 00:43:09,320
Well,
here,

867
00:43:09,320 --> 00:43:11,400
let me,
I'll take one last attempt to do it on a

868
00:43:11,401 --> 00:43:12,450
wider lens.
And then we'll go,

869
00:43:13,810 --> 00:43:15,530
um,
you know,

870
00:43:15,531 --> 00:43:17,480
I imagine

871
00:43:18,050 --> 00:43:23,050
somebody standing on a timeline and the 
center of the timeline is 1990 and uh,

872
00:43:23,450 --> 00:43:26,210
they go forward 25 years,
2015,

873
00:43:26,670 --> 00:43:28,310
and maybe they go to sleep and they wake
up.

874
00:43:28,340 --> 00:43:30,860
Who are the most important politicians 
in the country when they go to sleep?

875
00:43:31,220 --> 00:43:33,320
Bush and Clinton,
who are the most important politician in

876
00:43:33,321 --> 00:43:35,300
the country in 2015,
Bush and Clinton,

877
00:43:35,420 --> 00:43:37,340
what are they talking about?
Iraq and healthcare.

878
00:43:37,780 --> 00:43:38,613
Uh,
you go back 25 years from 1990 to 1965 

879
00:43:41,870 --> 00:43:44,480
and it's a different world.
There's an afl cio.

880
00:43:44,690 --> 00:43:46,160
Uh,
there were riots in the cities.

881
00:43:46,161 --> 00:43:49,190
There are liberal Republicans and 
Segregationist Democrats.

882
00:43:50,270 --> 00:43:51,103
So we have had this frozen politics for 
a long time and it was ready to be 

883
00:43:54,801 --> 00:43:56,060
changed.
And Donald Trump,

884
00:43:56,290 --> 00:43:58,520
the existing Republican party couldn't 
cope with it.

885
00:43:58,790 --> 00:44:01,250
And Donald Trump did.
He smash the system open.

886
00:44:01,670 --> 00:44:06,190
So he's created some opportunities for a
new kind of political arrange,

887
00:44:06,370 --> 00:44:08,930
an arrangement because the old one had 
become so stale.

888
00:44:09,140 --> 00:44:12,230
But what he's also done,
and this is the theme of the book,

889
00:44:13,130 --> 00:44:16,070
is He's raising questions,
not just about the way we do politics,

890
00:44:16,071 --> 00:44:16,904
but rather the whole political system 
because he is a deeply authoritarian 

891
00:44:19,971 --> 00:44:24,080
personality.
His project is authoritarian and the way

892
00:44:24,081 --> 00:44:27,230
he governs is not compatible with the 
rule of law society.

893
00:44:29,360 --> 00:44:31,010
It was going to happen one way or 
another.

894
00:44:31,050 --> 00:44:31,980
Right.
Do you think that's

895
00:44:31,980 --> 00:44:32,813
fair to say?
Where is he so unique or that 

896
00:44:34,561 --> 00:44:36,980
personality trait or that,
you know,

897
00:44:36,981 --> 00:44:37,814
the type of person that would be willing
to do it is so unique that we have like 

898
00:44:43,230 --> 00:44:46,020
trump,
like figures all over the western world.

899
00:44:46,280 --> 00:44:47,030
Um,
you know,

900
00:44:47,030 --> 00:44:47,863
we have a global crisis of.
Well I mean unique to our American 

901
00:44:49,831 --> 00:44:50,664
system because there was no one,
even though Bernie was actually talking 

902
00:44:52,531 --> 00:44:53,364
about rattling the system the same way.
And I think that's why there was some 

903
00:44:55,741 --> 00:44:58,320
crossover with their audiences.
We have people in,

904
00:44:58,440 --> 00:45:01,260
I mean there's geared builders.
There is Marine Le Pen,

905
00:45:01,800 --> 00:45:03,990
there's the alternative for Germany.
We just,

906
00:45:05,100 --> 00:45:05,933
we're recording.
I'm just a few days before people see 

907
00:45:08,341 --> 00:45:09,174
this program.
There's an election in Italy in which 

908
00:45:10,591 --> 00:45:11,424
the traditional parties were swept aside
and I kind of joke party the five star 

909
00:45:16,351 --> 00:45:18,060
movement,
which was founded by a comedian and,

910
00:45:18,061 --> 00:45:19,180
which is,
you know,

911
00:45:19,560 --> 00:45:20,090
kind of,
uh,

912
00:45:20,090 --> 00:45:23,550
an authoritarian populist party of the 
left is now in league with,

913
00:45:23,650 --> 00:45:24,483
um,
kind of neo fascist party and we are 

914
00:45:25,681 --> 00:45:26,514
seeing the breakdown of the traditional 
parties of the center driven by slow 

915
00:45:30,001 --> 00:45:31,470
growth and ethnic competition.

916
00:45:32,010 --> 00:45:32,843
Well,
that's what I'm saying was it gonna 

917
00:45:33,100 --> 00:45:36,230
happen no matter what,
even if trump had lost this election,

918
00:45:36,330 --> 00:45:38,310
trump never rode.
So nothing is going to happen,

919
00:45:38,311 --> 00:45:40,890
no matter what.
People make choices.

920
00:45:41,220 --> 00:45:42,053
Um,
you know,

921
00:45:42,120 --> 00:45:46,710
at the darkest moments in American 
history in 1930 to 18,

922
00:45:46,711 --> 00:45:47,990
60,
um,

923
00:45:48,540 --> 00:45:49,373
political parties and political 
movements converged on programs that 

924
00:45:51,721 --> 00:45:52,554
were constitutional,
that were liberal in the broadest sense 

925
00:45:54,691 --> 00:45:55,524
of the term.
And they found leaders who wanted to 

926
00:45:57,270 --> 00:46:02,250
uphold the American tradition and change
it enough that it could continue,

927
00:46:02,430 --> 00:46:03,263
but without violating its assets.
This time it's as if huey long had 

928
00:46:07,861 --> 00:46:10,470
become president 1932,
not Franklin Delanor Roosevelt.

929
00:46:10,680 --> 00:46:11,930
Okay.
So let,

930
00:46:11,960 --> 00:46:12,793
let's just do like a couple minutes of 
Russia so that we can get to that 

931
00:46:15,181 --> 00:46:17,160
because we can't talk about trump 
without talking about Russia.

932
00:46:17,180 --> 00:46:18,013
You tweet a lot about Russia.
Obviously you write about Russia like 

933
00:46:19,621 --> 00:46:20,454
you're talking about.

934
00:46:20,670 --> 00:46:25,670
Do you absolutely believe that he 
himself orchestrated or coordinated some

935
00:46:27,631 --> 00:46:29,670
of this stuff with the Russian 
government?

936
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:33,420
There remain many secrets in the Russia 
story or there's no mystery,

937
00:46:34,200 --> 00:46:39,200
uh,
the exact modalities of how the exchange

938
00:46:40,531 --> 00:46:43,370
happened that remain uncertain.
But here,

939
00:46:43,371 --> 00:46:44,204
here,
here is what I think I do know and I 

940
00:46:45,421 --> 00:46:47,730
think what unit,
um,

941
00:46:48,240 --> 00:46:49,073
we know that Russia wanted Donald Trump 
to be president and even more badly 

942
00:46:51,691 --> 00:46:53,550
wanted Hillary Clinton not to be 
precedent.

943
00:46:54,120 --> 00:46:56,190
Um,
we know that they intervened in an,

944
00:46:56,280 --> 00:47:00,390
in a massive way and an industrial scale
and we're learning more and more all the

945
00:47:00,391 --> 00:47:01,224
time.
How big was to hurt Hillary Clinton 

946
00:47:02,201 --> 00:47:03,034
first in the Democratic primaries to 
help Donald Trump first in the 

947
00:47:05,741 --> 00:47:06,574
republican primaries and then in the 
general election to help trump it 

948
00:47:09,210 --> 00:47:11,250
Clinton's expenses.
Can you give me just for people that are

949
00:47:11,251 --> 00:47:13,350
playing total category?
So what are the examples of that?

950
00:47:13,410 --> 00:47:14,010
Well,
let me.

951
00:47:14,010 --> 00:47:15,850
Here's the most dramatic example.
Um,

952
00:47:16,880 --> 00:47:21,420
uh,
the wiki leaks tropes are dumped in ways

953
00:47:21,480 --> 00:47:26,480
exactly timed to help Donald Trump.
The trump people were expecting the last

954
00:47:27,631 --> 00:47:30,430
wiki leaks stump of the election in the 
first week of October.

955
00:47:30,431 --> 00:47:31,264
They knew it was coming.
They expected to Donna about October 

956
00:47:33,581 --> 00:47:35,230
fourth or fifth.
It didn't come that day.

957
00:47:35,620 --> 00:47:37,840
Instead,
it was dumped on October seventh,

958
00:47:38,050 --> 00:47:38,883
within an hour of the access Hollywood 
tape being broken by David Fahrenthold 

959
00:47:41,771 --> 00:47:43,040
of the Washington Post,
the,

960
00:47:43,340 --> 00:47:45,190
the Russians or whoever controls wiki 
leaks,

961
00:47:45,191 --> 00:47:47,980
which I believe is,
I believe in Mike Pompeo.

962
00:47:47,981 --> 00:47:52,780
The head of the CIA believes is weak.
Links is a cut out for the Russians have

963
00:47:52,781 --> 00:47:53,614
not directly controlled by them.
They time their last Wiki leaks dump to 

964
00:47:57,311 --> 00:48:00,160
help Donald Trump should he have a 
crisis in the election.

965
00:48:00,400 --> 00:48:01,860
And it did,
um,

966
00:48:02,260 --> 00:48:03,570
and it,
and I,

967
00:48:03,580 --> 00:48:04,271
I,
in the book,

968
00:48:04,271 --> 00:48:07,160
I sort of gave the minute by minute tick
tock where you see it seats,

969
00:48:07,340 --> 00:48:08,230
um,
you know,

970
00:48:08,231 --> 00:48:09,130
the Russians.
Would that help

971
00:48:09,940 --> 00:48:14,720
God is the real question of whether the 
campaign itself was coordinating that or

972
00:48:14,721 --> 00:48:16,560
look,
we do all sorts of things with other,

973
00:48:16,610 --> 00:48:19,040
with foreign governments and elections 
and all kinds of stuff.

974
00:48:19,070 --> 00:48:19,903
So whether,
whether the campaign actually was 

975
00:48:21,291 --> 00:48:23,120
coordinating it with a foreign 
government,

976
00:48:23,270 --> 00:48:25,910
which obviously we've done illegal,
we know that Donald,

977
00:48:25,970 --> 00:48:28,940
as opposed to them just doing it and 
having to work out for trump

978
00:48:29,410 --> 00:48:30,760
to,
to Hakone Americans.

979
00:48:30,761 --> 00:48:32,890
Email is a crime.
It's a big crime.

980
00:48:33,400 --> 00:48:34,233
Um,
if you know that a crime has been 

981
00:48:35,021 --> 00:48:39,370
committed against Americans by you,
by a foreign government,

982
00:48:39,371 --> 00:48:42,010
you would be annoyed about that,
especially if you aspire to be present.

983
00:48:42,011 --> 00:48:45,910
United States the idea that Donald,
so we don't know to what degree yet.

984
00:48:45,970 --> 00:48:48,250
We don't know to what degree,
if any,

985
00:48:48,251 --> 00:48:49,084
people on his campaign work in regular 
back and forth communication with the 

986
00:48:51,821 --> 00:48:52,654
Russians,
but he stood on a stage and in June of 

987
00:48:55,691 --> 00:49:00,670
2016 and welcomed the Russians breaking 
American law to steal his opponents.

988
00:49:00,700 --> 00:49:01,533
Email to his advantage.
His son took a meeting with people who 

989
00:49:04,961 --> 00:49:07,990
are offering him Russian hacked 
information on Hillary Clinton.

990
00:49:08,140 --> 00:49:10,930
They didn't do at the meeting,
the Russians didn't deliver,

991
00:49:11,420 --> 00:49:13,650
um,
but you know it

992
00:49:13,970 --> 00:49:14,803
well when we say the Russians,
we have to clarify between the 

993
00:49:16,341 --> 00:49:20,230
government and just other actors because
everyone says the Russians as it,

994
00:49:20,260 --> 00:49:22,480
the lawyer one monolithic thing,
the true,

995
00:49:22,600 --> 00:49:23,433
the lawyer who was at the meeting with 
somebody with intense Kremlin 

996
00:49:25,241 --> 00:49:26,074
connections and who advertise that she 
had criminal connections that she said 

997
00:49:29,250 --> 00:49:30,083
in the famous email to don Jr,
the Russian government wants to elect 

998
00:49:32,621 --> 00:49:33,454
your father.
I have information from the Russian 

999
00:49:34,961 --> 00:49:36,370
government.
It could help your campaign.

1000
00:49:36,550 --> 00:49:37,510
And he said,
great,

1001
00:49:37,570 --> 00:49:39,220
I love it.
Especially in the summer.

1002
00:49:40,270 --> 00:49:41,103
I am telling you that if an emissary 
from the Russian government had 

1003
00:49:44,711 --> 00:49:47,980
approached George W dot Bush in the 
election of 2000 and said,

1004
00:49:48,040 --> 00:49:49,840
I have information on Al Gore,
that'll help you.

1005
00:49:50,980 --> 00:49:51,813
There wouldn't have been a meeting.
They would know a phone call to the FBI 

1006
00:49:53,770 --> 00:49:54,603
and,
and there might even have been a phone 

1007
00:49:55,121 --> 00:49:57,160
call to the Gore campaign.
You guys should know about this.

1008
00:49:57,790 --> 00:49:58,840
What do you think?
All right.

1009
00:49:58,841 --> 00:49:59,674
So.

1010
00:50:00,460 --> 00:50:01,293
All right,
so you believe that without question 

1011
00:50:02,341 --> 00:50:03,180
there was coordinate?

1012
00:50:03,400 --> 00:50:04,233
No,
so I,

1013
00:50:04,420 --> 00:50:05,253
I believe the Russians helped and I 
believe that Donald Trump is not a 

1014
00:50:08,711 --> 00:50:09,790
belief.
It's on video.

1015
00:50:09,791 --> 00:50:10,890
You can look it up now.
Trump,

1016
00:50:10,930 --> 00:50:14,800
welcome to help and was ready to accept 
the help,

1017
00:50:15,700 --> 00:50:16,533
um,
and a profit it from the help and that 

1018
00:50:19,600 --> 00:50:20,433
and that.
And I believe it made a difference in 

1019
00:50:21,821 --> 00:50:22,654
the election.
I believe also that there were Russian 

1020
00:50:24,341 --> 00:50:28,100
attempts as far as we know,
they're not successful to interfere with

1021
00:50:28,101 --> 00:50:30,710
the actual mechanics of voting in a 
number of states.

1022
00:50:31,270 --> 00:50:32,300
What?
Here's what I don't know.

1023
00:50:32,750 --> 00:50:33,583
I don't know whether information regular
information flowed back from the United 

1024
00:50:37,940 --> 00:50:39,890
States to Russia after don junior is 
meeting.

1025
00:50:40,100 --> 00:50:40,933
I don't know that.
I don't know whether the Russian 

1026
00:50:42,440 --> 00:50:43,273
operation to influence the American 
election benefited from any kind of 

1027
00:50:46,131 --> 00:50:48,140
information provided by American 
counterparts.

1028
00:50:48,141 --> 00:50:48,974
Those are things we don't know.
What I do know is that Donald Trump did 

1029
00:50:52,371 --> 00:50:53,204
not act patriotically and he did not act
with respect to the American political 

1030
00:50:55,791 --> 00:50:57,410
system and I will never get past that.

1031
00:50:58,550 --> 00:51:02,030
Do you think the Democrats have any of 
the same dirt on their hands?

1032
00:51:02,330 --> 00:51:03,890
No.
Nothing.

1033
00:51:05,220 --> 00:51:05,860
I mean,
look,

1034
00:51:05,860 --> 00:51:06,920
it's,
it's not been bad.

1035
00:51:06,940 --> 00:51:07,200
Um,
they,

1036
00:51:07,200 --> 00:51:08,710
they did many,
uh,

1037
00:51:08,711 --> 00:51:09,950
they did many things.
I mean,

1038
00:51:10,130 --> 00:51:12,290
when,
when Hillary Clinton found,

1039
00:51:12,430 --> 00:51:13,263
um,
that a South American beauty queen who 

1040
00:51:16,401 --> 00:51:19,730
is offended by Donald Trump,
do I,

1041
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:20,833
is it possible the Clinton campaign paid
her money for her story as that's 

1042
00:51:24,080 --> 00:51:27,020
possible,
but there's a difference between there.

1043
00:51:27,370 --> 00:51:28,203
I really do that there's a bright line 
difference between the usual operations 

1044
00:51:31,881 --> 00:51:36,650
of American politics.
It can be pretty rough and accepting,

1045
00:51:36,651 --> 00:51:37,484
help from the client,
the clandestine service of a foreign 

1046
00:51:41,061 --> 00:51:41,680
government.
Wayne,

1047
00:51:41,680 --> 00:51:43,370
give you another example to make a 
difference.

1048
00:51:43,810 --> 00:51:44,643
So in 2004,
it was no secret that gearhard 

1049
00:51:47,340 --> 00:51:49,220
Schroeder,
Germany and Jacques Chirac,

1050
00:51:49,221 --> 00:51:50,054
the president,
France would dearly love to see John 

1051
00:51:52,010 --> 00:51:54,650
Kerry beat George W dot Bush.
They made that very clear.

1052
00:51:54,860 --> 00:51:55,820
They gave interviews.

1053
00:51:56,360 --> 00:51:58,580
Uh,
they are very clear,

1054
00:51:59,150 --> 00:51:59,983
they are just counting the minutes until
Bush was gone and it was also clear in 

1055
00:52:03,231 --> 00:52:08,231
2012 that Benjamin Netanyahu in Israel 
preferred a net romney to Obama.

1056
00:52:09,560 --> 00:52:13,470
Either your allies have opinions.
It is.

1057
00:52:14,070 --> 00:52:16,940
None of those elections.
Did we have hostile foreign states?

1058
00:52:16,970 --> 00:52:18,110
China,
Russia,

1059
00:52:18,200 --> 00:52:19,550
Iran,
actors like that,

1060
00:52:19,910 --> 00:52:22,100
working,
not through talking to journalists,

1061
00:52:22,250 --> 00:52:26,510
but through clandestine intelligence 
services to help one candidate and heard

1062
00:52:26,511 --> 00:52:31,511
another and have it all be visible and 
have the candidate who was helped except

1063
00:52:32,120 --> 00:52:37,120
the help and imagine if if ran,
he tried to intervene in 2012 against or

1064
00:52:38,001 --> 00:52:41,600
for Obama or Romney and one of those 
candidates had said,

1065
00:52:41,630 --> 00:52:42,970
you know,
Ryan,

1066
00:52:42,980 --> 00:52:45,200
if you're listening,
thank you for the help.

1067
00:52:45,650 --> 00:52:47,570
Inconceivable.
But that's what trump did.

1068
00:52:47,600 --> 00:52:50,950
He did it on video.
It's not a mystery so.

1069
00:52:51,990 --> 00:52:52,823
Right.
So I want to really talk about the 

1070
00:52:53,901 --> 00:52:55,550
presidency and sort of the decisions in 
that,

1071
00:52:55,551 --> 00:52:58,760
but to sort of get us to some sort of 
ending with this.

1072
00:52:59,480 --> 00:53:03,770
If this all unfurls way I think you 
suspect it will unfurl.

1073
00:53:04,130 --> 00:53:06,850
I mean I definitely would be for been 
moved.

1074
00:53:08,080 --> 00:53:08,913
This is where it's going.
So let's start with the part that I'm 

1075
00:53:10,611 --> 00:53:11,444
struggling with.
This is if we take all of the people 

1076
00:53:12,531 --> 00:53:13,364
that talk about all of this,
it seems to me what we're talking about 

1077
00:53:15,201 --> 00:53:15,531
is,
okay,

1078
00:53:15,531 --> 00:53:16,364
well you impeach trump and then really 
then we have to do something which is 

1079
00:53:18,861 --> 00:53:19,694
unprecedented.
Which is most likely pence knew 

1080
00:53:21,711 --> 00:53:23,990
something and now you have to take the 
whole administration out.

1081
00:53:24,200 --> 00:53:25,033
Now we suddenly have Paul Ryan as the 
president or we have a Redo of the 

1082
00:53:27,931 --> 00:53:30,490
election and then we're really at war 
with Russia.

1083
00:53:30,800 --> 00:53:34,080
How trump has already changed this.
So no pre heat.

1084
00:53:34,770 --> 00:53:35,603
The Russia part of this is just one of 
the things that have happened in no 

1085
00:53:40,050 --> 00:53:43,890
presidents is Lyndon Johnson has 
operated a business while president.

1086
00:53:44,870 --> 00:53:45,703
Nope.
No president in my memory has directed 

1087
00:53:48,991 --> 00:53:49,824
his party's funds into his own personal.
About 80 percent of the money that the 

1088
00:53:54,180 --> 00:53:55,013
Republican Party and spend on events I'm
in last year was paid at a Donald Trump 

1089
00:53:58,501 --> 00:53:59,334
branded resort.
So this is like when they're holding 

1090
00:54:00,870 --> 00:54:05,870
meetings at more or with.
A friend of mine sent me this clip,

1091
00:54:06,271 --> 00:54:07,104
George Schultz,
who was secretary of state under Ronald 

1092
00:54:08,390 --> 00:54:09,223
Reagan,
had been an important executive maybe 

1093
00:54:10,320 --> 00:54:12,390
ceo at Bechtel,
the giant engineering firm,

1094
00:54:12,900 --> 00:54:16,650
and that his confirmation hearing,
he was asked Mr Schultz after you become

1095
00:54:16,651 --> 00:54:17,484
secretary of state,
what would your relationship be with 

1096
00:54:18,661 --> 00:54:20,070
Bechtel?
And he said,

1097
00:54:20,071 --> 00:54:21,390
well,
there's only one possible answer.

1098
00:54:21,900 --> 00:54:23,940
Nothing.
That's right.

1099
00:54:24,150 --> 00:54:25,660
That was the standard,
um,

1100
00:54:26,250 --> 00:54:31,250
so when you have is an attack on every 
ethical norm of the US government,

1101
00:54:32,250 --> 00:54:33,083
both financial and national security and
the sea and half the country is being 

1102
00:54:37,081 --> 00:54:39,300
born along.
Then the discussions we're having,

1103
00:54:39,780 --> 00:54:44,780
our discussions that I prompt in nine 
slash 2013 as recently as that.

1104
00:54:45,200 --> 00:54:46,033
I said,
someday we'll be having these 

1105
00:54:46,651 --> 00:54:48,000
discussions.
People think,

1106
00:54:48,001 --> 00:54:48,834
well,
we will be so far gone even to 

1107
00:54:50,281 --> 00:54:52,680
contemplate.
So that is an unprocessable.

1108
00:54:53,360 --> 00:54:54,193
Um,
are we heading toward an impeachment 

1109
00:54:55,230 --> 00:54:56,063
crisis?
Here's what were the crisis we're 

1110
00:54:56,820 --> 00:54:59,550
heading toward.
And here's what I really,

1111
00:55:01,820 --> 00:55:04,340
one of my deepest worries,
I think we're,

1112
00:55:04,770 --> 00:55:05,603
there's a good chance we're going to 
arrive at this place that Mueller is 

1113
00:55:07,291 --> 00:55:08,124
going to report if he's assuming he's 
not fired and he's going to discover a 

1114
00:55:10,651 --> 00:55:11,484
lot of things that are violations of the
law done by mid level and even upper 

1115
00:55:14,881 --> 00:55:15,714
level people.
And he may discover some financial 

1116
00:55:18,631 --> 00:55:19,464
malpractices or a lot of laws about 
things like declaring you're a foreign 

1117
00:55:22,050 --> 00:55:22,883
agent,
that there are technical rules about 

1118
00:55:25,920 --> 00:55:29,580
campaign finance and he will discover or
may infractions of those.

1119
00:55:30,270 --> 00:55:31,103
But the core thing and the Russian 
matter that people like near concerned 

1120
00:55:33,661 --> 00:55:35,790
about is probably not illegal.

1121
00:55:36,210 --> 00:55:37,043
It's probably not illegal for an 
American politician to work with a 

1122
00:55:39,541 --> 00:55:40,321
hostile foreign.
I mean,

1123
00:55:40,321 --> 00:55:41,154
no,
there isn't such a law and it's hard to 

1124
00:55:41,791 --> 00:55:46,791
imagine what such law would look like.
And so where we may be a year and a half

1125
00:55:46,891 --> 00:55:51,540
from now is confronting this.
Donald trump worked in some way.

1126
00:55:51,570 --> 00:55:53,010
We may be,
I'm not predicting this,

1127
00:55:53,011 --> 00:55:53,844
I'm just hypothesizing worked in some 
way with a hostile foreign intelligence 

1128
00:55:56,731 --> 00:55:57,564
service,
but he himself broken a law and doing 

1129
00:55:59,641 --> 00:56:02,040
that and now the country's going to have
to process,

1130
00:56:02,490 --> 00:56:03,900
um,
how to deal with that.

1131
00:56:03,990 --> 00:56:04,823
And it's going to be part of what is 
going on in this new era which is 

1132
00:56:07,320 --> 00:56:09,090
ripping apart the,
the,

1133
00:56:09,220 --> 00:56:10,053
the cords that bind us.
Because one of the things that makes a 

1134
00:56:12,811 --> 00:56:17,130
country is the assumption how your 
connections to your fellow Americans,

1135
00:56:17,131 --> 00:56:18,480
however much you may disagree with them.

1136
00:56:18,930 --> 00:56:19,763
And however you may have a different 
color skin or have a different accent 

1137
00:56:22,291 --> 00:56:23,124
from you,
that bond is more powerful than the 

1138
00:56:25,931 --> 00:56:26,764
bonds outside the border.
And as American politics becomes 

1139
00:56:30,580 --> 00:56:33,670
emphasized,
I think a lot of people were saying,

1140
00:56:34,300 --> 00:56:35,133
my connections with this global movement
of reactionary populace forces are more 

1141
00:56:40,961 --> 00:56:41,794
powerful than my bonds to fellow 
Americans have different skin and 

1142
00:56:45,311 --> 00:56:48,100
different accent.
And because of that,

1143
00:56:48,760 --> 00:56:52,420
unless you could show me that Donald 
Trump literally broke a federal criminal

1144
00:56:52,421 --> 00:56:55,450
statute,
I don't mind what he did.

1145
00:56:57,190 --> 00:56:58,023
So how do we get out of this?
How do we get out of either that 

1146
00:56:59,981 --> 00:57:00,814
inevitability or do doing,
just ended up literally fighting on the 

1147
00:57:06,360 --> 00:57:07,193
street?
The way we get out of it is we have to 

1148
00:57:11,380 --> 00:57:14,050
venue American nationhood.
Um,

1149
00:57:14,200 --> 00:57:17,200
and so we have to do,
if we get out of this,

1150
00:57:17,380 --> 00:57:18,213
we're going to do something.
Some are going to sound pretty liberal 

1151
00:57:19,181 --> 00:57:20,440
and some are going to sound pretty 
conservative.

1152
00:57:21,130 --> 00:57:24,100
I believe we need a lot less immigration
because that's,

1153
00:57:24,310 --> 00:57:26,650
you have to,
we have to make a nation.

1154
00:57:26,651 --> 00:57:28,240
Again,
we've taken on a lot of new people.

1155
00:57:28,860 --> 00:57:30,060
Um,
and I,

1156
00:57:30,160 --> 00:57:31,630
I'm,
I'm a naturalized citizen myself.

1157
00:57:31,631 --> 00:57:34,240
I grew up in Canada and my family is 
from eastern Europe.

1158
00:57:34,960 --> 00:57:37,600
Making nations is hard and time 
consuming.

1159
00:57:38,080 --> 00:57:38,913
Um,
so that's the conservative part of the 

1160
00:57:40,181 --> 00:57:42,880
part you need to say that sounds pretty 
trumpy it actually,

1161
00:57:43,370 --> 00:57:44,203
you'll have the whole left and at 
virtually every Democrat against you 

1162
00:57:46,260 --> 00:57:49,210
that you need a thicker social insurance
network.

1163
00:57:49,650 --> 00:57:50,950
Um,
you need,

1164
00:57:51,070 --> 00:57:53,950
you need a real healthcare system 
because what we have to deal with,

1165
00:57:54,310 --> 00:57:55,143
we have to deal with the crisis in life,
expect we have to care for each other 

1166
00:57:57,821 --> 00:57:58,700
more.
Um,

1167
00:57:58,930 --> 00:58:03,310
the idea that we went through in the 
whole second Obama term,

1168
00:58:04,120 --> 00:58:07,690
people who didn't graduate from college 
living less long than their parents,

1169
00:58:07,840 --> 00:58:10,030
which literally did not happen in the 
Great Depression.

1170
00:58:10,570 --> 00:58:13,900
And not only did nobody do anything but 
no one even noticed.

1171
00:58:14,530 --> 00:58:17,200
This was founded by pair of economists 
who happened to look at some data.

1172
00:58:17,350 --> 00:58:19,270
There's no one was paying a lot of 
attention to this.

1173
00:58:19,570 --> 00:58:20,403
The opioid epidemic erupted with no one 
in Washington paying much attention to 

1174
00:58:24,191 --> 00:58:25,390
it.
Um,

1175
00:58:26,110 --> 00:58:26,860
we need,
uh,

1176
00:58:26,860 --> 00:58:27,693
we're going to need to build a stronger,
a stronger sense of national identity 

1177
00:58:32,920 --> 00:58:34,450
and,
but it's going to be a different kind of

1178
00:58:34,451 --> 00:58:37,330
national identity is not going to be 
Sarah Palin's America,

1179
00:58:37,570 --> 00:58:38,403
but we have to,
we're going to have to find some way of 

1180
00:58:39,131 --> 00:58:40,830
agreeing what it means to be an 
American,

1181
00:58:40,870 --> 00:58:43,320
what it means not to be an American or 
whatever it is,

1182
00:58:43,330 --> 00:58:46,480
the inherent problem there that were 
caught now between trump and sort of the

1183
00:58:46,481 --> 00:58:47,314
democrats that love identity politics.
And neither one of those is giving us 

1184
00:58:49,781 --> 00:58:51,010
the answer to that.

1185
00:58:51,010 --> 00:58:52,180
I mean,
where is the voice?

1186
00:58:52,181 --> 00:58:53,014
That's where is the political voice 
that's saying exactly what you just 

1187
00:58:54,971 --> 00:58:55,601
said.
Look,

1188
00:58:55,601 --> 00:58:58,090
we've been here before,
um,

1189
00:58:58,570 --> 00:58:59,403
you know,
that melting pot story that you were 

1190
00:59:00,611 --> 00:59:05,611
told it wasn't true at the time.
It was a myth we created later.

1191
00:59:07,240 --> 00:59:09,820
Um,
when the United States entered World War

1192
00:59:09,820 --> 00:59:10,653
One,
the biggest minority in the country was 

1193
00:59:12,690 --> 00:59:14,590
one of the biggest with German speaking 
Americans.

1194
00:59:15,040 --> 00:59:15,873
Um,
and there was real doubt about what the 

1195
00:59:17,320 --> 00:59:18,153
United States would be able to fight 
Germany in the first world war because 

1196
00:59:19,421 --> 00:59:22,550
the German Americans might be disloyal 
and the country went on a ramp,

1197
00:59:22,551 --> 00:59:24,070
I mean a band,
German language,

1198
00:59:24,190 --> 00:59:26,540
newspapers that suppressed German 
language schools.

1199
00:59:26,750 --> 00:59:31,750
And it wasn't a melting pot.
It was a harsh and rancorous process.

1200
00:59:33,110 --> 00:59:37,040
And the United States had in the 19th in
the immediate aftermath of world war,

1201
00:59:37,041 --> 00:59:37,874
one of pogroms in American cities that 
were very against by white Americans 

1202
00:59:42,171 --> 00:59:46,880
against blocks that were deadlier than 
the antisemitic programs that took place

1203
00:59:46,910 --> 00:59:47,743
under the czar.

1204
00:59:47,790 --> 00:59:48,860
Um,
uh,

1205
00:59:48,950 --> 00:59:51,650
those were facts of our history and 
other that we built.

1206
00:59:53,230 --> 00:59:54,063
But I'm in the years after World War Two
and for half a century after a strong 

1207
00:59:58,791 --> 00:59:59,624
sense of national identity,
we have to do that state building and 

1208
01:00:01,911 --> 01:00:05,810
nation building process again.
And some of it's going to not look.

1209
01:00:05,811 --> 01:00:08,600
I is going to look out partly liberal,
partly conservative.

1210
01:00:09,760 --> 01:00:10,593
Um,
but it's going to be a new politics for 

1211
01:00:11,361 --> 01:00:13,590
a new century.
And the idea that people are going that.

1212
01:00:13,730 --> 01:00:16,310
And if anyone is standing around saying,
I don't know,

1213
01:00:16,311 --> 01:00:20,780
I think I prefer the problems of 1982 so
I can have the solutions of 1982.

1214
01:00:21,110 --> 01:00:22,490
I mean,
you're just not helping.

1215
01:00:23,190 --> 01:00:25,260
What would you say to the people that 
would say,

1216
01:00:25,350 --> 01:00:27,930
and this is a little bit more where I 
fall in all of this,

1217
01:00:27,931 --> 01:00:28,764
that the government is just not the 
answer to any of these things that I 

1218
01:00:31,680 --> 01:00:34,170
hear you on all of these problems 
without question,

1219
01:00:34,171 --> 01:00:35,830
no doubt.
Um,

1220
01:00:35,880 --> 01:00:39,180
but that to me at this point that 
everything you're talking about,

1221
01:00:39,181 --> 01:00:42,060
he's showing me the government no longer
functions this,

1222
01:00:42,120 --> 01:00:42,953
the federal government specifically no 
longer functions in a way that it can 

1223
01:00:45,691 --> 01:00:46,524
cope or deal with any of these things we
get then bad actors that want to wreck 

1224
01:00:49,681 --> 01:00:50,514
the whole thing.
Or we get these mid level management 

1225
01:00:52,141 --> 01:00:52,974
people that never really do anything and
that you could look at virtually every 

1226
01:00:55,651 --> 01:00:59,010
member of Congress that all the answers 
that you're asking for,

1227
01:00:59,520 --> 01:01:02,550
I would argue have almost nothing to do 
with the government.

1228
01:01:02,730 --> 01:01:03,563
And that there's other ways now,
especially because of the Internet and 

1229
01:01:05,701 --> 01:01:06,534
everything else.
There's other ways that we can connect 

1230
01:01:08,791 --> 01:01:10,200
and build things.
Right now.

1231
01:01:10,201 --> 01:01:12,480
Elon musk is the guy that's getting us 
into space.

1232
01:01:12,720 --> 01:01:15,370
Warren Buffet's working on an alternate,
um,

1233
01:01:15,660 --> 01:01:17,070
healthcare plan,
you know,

1234
01:01:17,071 --> 01:01:19,650
like that there's just other ways to do 
this and that,

1235
01:01:19,651 --> 01:01:22,620
those machines,
they can't work anymore.

1236
01:01:22,650 --> 01:01:23,483
Looks something.

1237
01:01:23,640 --> 01:01:24,473
A lot of the great social 
transformations have in the American 

1238
01:01:27,241 --> 01:01:28,074
history is different from that of other 
countries in this way that oftentimes 

1239
01:01:31,681 --> 01:01:35,250
the way the country is addressed,
the most effective cultural change in my

1240
01:01:35,251 --> 01:01:37,830
lifetime was prompt with mothers against
drunk driving.

1241
01:01:38,200 --> 01:01:40,950
Um,
that changed Americans' attitudes.

1242
01:01:40,951 --> 01:01:42,340
They changed laws to.
I mean the,

1243
01:01:42,400 --> 01:01:43,800
the government,
the state has a role.

1244
01:01:44,160 --> 01:01:44,670
Um,
I,

1245
01:01:44,670 --> 01:01:45,503
I think for things like the gun debate,
I mean that I think that is going to be 

1246
01:01:48,571 --> 01:01:49,404
ultimately addressed if it is addressed 
not by state action brought by private 

1247
01:01:51,901 --> 01:01:53,580
action,
which is whatever the laws are.

1248
01:01:53,700 --> 01:01:54,533
Just if you,
if you have kids and you care about 

1249
01:01:55,381 --> 01:01:56,640
them,
don't have a gun in the house,

1250
01:01:56,860 --> 01:01:59,880
you know that justice mothers against 
drunk driving change.

1251
01:01:59,881 --> 01:02:02,760
The idea that it was funny,
drunk driving was funny too.

1252
01:02:02,761 --> 01:02:03,594
The idea that it was not funny,
so we have to change the idea that if 

1253
01:02:06,331 --> 01:02:07,980
you're a responsible parent,
your arm to,

1254
01:02:07,981 --> 01:02:08,814
um,
a new better understanding that if 

1255
01:02:10,951 --> 01:02:14,230
you're armed,
you're not a responsible parent a,

1256
01:02:15,210 --> 01:02:15,730
but

1257
01:02:15,730 --> 01:02:17,550
the Conservatives won't be happy here 
you say.

1258
01:02:17,740 --> 01:02:19,120
That's right.
That's right.

1259
01:02:19,160 --> 01:02:19,980
A lot won't be,
but

1260
01:02:19,980 --> 01:02:21,300
it's true.
It just happens to be.

1261
01:02:21,710 --> 01:02:22,543
What's the saying?
The facts don't care about your 

1262
01:02:24,331 --> 01:02:26,760
feelings.
It's just a fact.

1263
01:02:26,950 --> 01:02:28,280
I'm a,

1264
01:02:28,630 --> 01:02:31,220
I think ben would argue with that fact,
but maybe we can do that,

1265
01:02:31,290 --> 01:02:33,520
but we will be sensitive feelings.

1266
01:02:36,080 --> 01:02:36,913
Uh,

1267
01:02:37,900 --> 01:02:38,733
but then of course you had the 
government has to do this and it's true 

1268
01:02:40,961 --> 01:02:42,640
that dollar for dollar and pound for 
pound,

1269
01:02:42,641 --> 01:02:45,700
the American government has always been 
less effective than other governments.

1270
01:02:46,060 --> 01:02:46,893
But sometimes it's more effective and 
sometimes it's less effective or things 

1271
01:02:50,080 --> 01:02:51,940
that the government is going to have to 
do.

1272
01:02:52,050 --> 01:02:52,883
Um,
and the government doesn't have to 

1273
01:02:53,710 --> 01:02:56,500
administer the healthcare system.
I would hope it wouldn't.

1274
01:02:57,080 --> 01:02:59,380
There's a role for the profit motive and
for competition.

1275
01:02:59,890 --> 01:03:00,723
But the idea that we're going to accept 
a country in which large numbers of 

1276
01:03:04,721 --> 01:03:08,800
Americans are uncovered are outside the 
healthcare system and um,

1277
01:03:09,190 --> 01:03:11,950
that people literally die because they 
get,

1278
01:03:12,010 --> 01:03:12,843
they can't afford dental care and their 
teeth fester and fester and gets into 

1279
01:03:15,251 --> 01:03:18,490
their body and it kills them.
That has to change.

1280
01:03:18,840 --> 01:03:21,580
And that the role of the state is part 
of,

1281
01:03:21,880 --> 01:03:22,713
if we're going to have a new ethic of 
nationhood without higher border and 

1282
01:03:26,081 --> 01:03:27,970
more mutual care.
Um,

1283
01:03:28,270 --> 01:03:29,103
yeah,
of course governments going to be part 

1284
01:03:29,531 --> 01:03:30,580
of that.
And by the way,

1285
01:03:30,581 --> 01:03:32,800
not that that only the federal 
government because a lot of the.

1286
01:03:32,801 --> 01:03:33,634
I mean the country is big.
I mean a running California is 

1287
01:03:36,020 --> 01:03:36,853
challenged enough.

1288
01:03:38,430 --> 01:03:42,020
So since you don't say you're a 
conservative specifically anymore,

1289
01:03:42,030 --> 01:03:44,670
I mean,
what if people are listening and going,

1290
01:03:44,671 --> 01:03:45,504
I get this.
It's a little bit of both because 

1291
01:03:46,321 --> 01:03:47,870
there's a lot of big government here.
There's,

1292
01:03:47,880 --> 01:03:48,713
I know you're saying you would prefer 
the government not have to do health 

1293
01:03:50,791 --> 01:03:51,331
insurance,
all that.

1294
01:03:51,331 --> 01:03:51,850
You're,
you're,

1295
01:03:51,850 --> 01:03:53,070
you're sort of all over the place right 
now.

1296
01:03:53,071 --> 01:03:53,904
Which I think a lot of people are.
I think that's the situation we're in 

1297
01:03:56,551 --> 01:03:57,960
right now.
Um,

1298
01:03:58,080 --> 01:04:00,040
what do you call that now?
Not that.

1299
01:04:00,360 --> 01:04:01,193
And I only ask about labels because 
although they're becoming increasingly 

1300
01:04:03,271 --> 01:04:05,640
meaningless,
I think it helps people go,

1301
01:04:05,641 --> 01:04:07,140
all right,
this is my starting point.

1302
01:04:07,530 --> 01:04:07,960
Well,
I,

1303
01:04:07,960 --> 01:04:08,793
I don't have a label for it because I 
think this is one of those moments in 

1304
01:04:12,391 --> 01:04:14,580
American history where you have to do 
something new.

1305
01:04:15,180 --> 01:04:16,110
Um,
you know,

1306
01:04:16,111 --> 01:04:18,810
for,
for 25 years after the civil war,

1307
01:04:18,990 --> 01:04:19,823
Americans kept arguing both about the 
civil war and about its financial 

1308
01:04:22,291 --> 01:04:23,124
consequences.
And then they began to notice that in 

1309
01:04:25,531 --> 01:04:26,364
the aftermath that they had these big 
cities grow up that were intensely 

1310
01:04:28,711 --> 01:04:29,544
corruptly governed.
And I'm a new new movements came along 

1311
01:04:33,980 --> 01:04:35,300
and said,
uh,

1312
01:04:35,610 --> 01:04:36,443
we have.
It's not like the legacy of the civil 

1313
01:04:38,791 --> 01:04:41,970
wars is resolved.
It's still not fully resolved.

1314
01:04:42,330 --> 01:04:45,030
But in the meantime we have to figure 
how do we get streetcars in New York?

1315
01:04:45,031 --> 01:04:46,810
How do we get the water clean?
Um,

1316
01:04:46,920 --> 01:04:47,753
how do we make sure that the older men 
are and aren't taking bribes and that 

1317
01:04:50,990 --> 01:04:52,860
new political.
And at first they weren't,

1318
01:04:52,920 --> 01:04:56,820
they just knew what the problems were 
and as they worked on the problems,

1319
01:04:57,090 --> 01:04:59,370
they develop labels to describe what 
they were doing.

1320
01:04:59,370 --> 01:05:01,950
But first you start,
I think one of the ways that,

1321
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:03,390
um,
especially on the right,

1322
01:05:04,620 --> 01:05:06,300
one of the,
one of the ways that we go wrong,

1323
01:05:06,570 --> 01:05:07,403
it's a new problem is presented to us 
and instead of looking at the problem 

1324
01:05:09,751 --> 01:05:12,350
studying it,
we reach for volume of the Talmud and we

1325
01:05:12,360 --> 01:05:13,193
say,
what did rabbi I'm Russell Kirk say 

1326
01:05:15,691 --> 01:05:17,980
about this three quarters of a century 
ago?

1327
01:05:18,280 --> 01:05:19,330
Oh,
he never talked about it,

1328
01:05:19,331 --> 01:05:22,420
therefore we can't do anything about it.
I feel good about this.

1329
01:05:23,040 --> 01:05:23,873
And I feel like you've presented it.
A couple of interesting ideas that I 

1330
01:05:25,651 --> 01:05:27,430
haven't,
that I haven't quite talked about here.

1331
01:05:27,431 --> 01:05:29,260
And you're coming at it from different 
angles.

1332
01:05:29,290 --> 01:05:31,180
Is there anyone that's doing this 
politically?

1333
01:05:31,181 --> 01:05:32,014
I mean,
who are the people that you right now 

1334
01:05:32,771 --> 01:05:34,210
think are making?
We're doing it right now.

1335
01:05:34,720 --> 01:05:38,170
You and I and um,
and I think,

1336
01:05:38,770 --> 01:05:39,603
look there,
there are a lot of things that come out 

1337
01:05:40,331 --> 01:05:42,310
of the trump era that are actually good.

1338
01:05:42,310 --> 01:05:44,500
They're prefers gifts that he's given 
us.

1339
01:05:44,860 --> 01:05:45,693
One of them is by lying all the time.
He's helped us understand how important 

1340
01:05:48,551 --> 01:05:49,384
it is.
The people tell the truth when you know 

1341
01:05:52,060 --> 01:05:53,680
you're concerned about what goes on on 
campus.

1342
01:05:53,681 --> 01:05:56,560
You know the phrase post-truth began as 
a compliment,

1343
01:05:56,740 --> 01:05:58,150
not a criticism.
It began by,

1344
01:05:58,360 --> 01:05:59,193
by people who wanted to overthrow 
totalitarian truth structures and open 

1345
01:06:02,121 --> 01:06:02,954
the way to many multiple truths.
And they discovered that when you do 

1346
01:06:05,441 --> 01:06:07,510
that in politics,
but you don't get the opposite of truth,

1347
01:06:07,540 --> 01:06:09,640
isn't truth.
The opposite of truth is lying.

1348
01:06:10,120 --> 01:06:12,340
We've seen rising levels of civic 
engagement and we,

1349
01:06:12,430 --> 01:06:14,980
I think we are seeing,
especially among the young,

1350
01:06:15,040 --> 01:06:18,550
a sense that the political categories 
they've inherited are obsolete.

1351
01:06:18,660 --> 01:06:19,493
Yeah.
And they have to start looking at 

1352
01:06:21,371 --> 01:06:22,920
problems a new,
uh,

1353
01:06:23,320 --> 01:06:28,320
and that they have to be begin with the 
problems and then develop the solutions.

1354
01:06:28,840 --> 01:06:32,290
And then people will disagree with a new
party system will come from is,

1355
01:06:32,470 --> 01:06:34,090
you know,
as we really contemplate,

1356
01:06:34,091 --> 01:06:37,060
how do we improve the health outcomes of
our fellow citizens?

1357
01:06:37,061 --> 01:06:37,894
How do we deal with drugs?
How do we deal with a declining life 

1358
01:06:39,701 --> 01:06:41,620
expectancy of those who don't go to 
college,

1359
01:06:42,970 --> 01:06:43,803
they're going to disagree and then 
they'll find like minded groups and 

1360
01:06:46,150 --> 01:06:48,220
they'll end up inside the Republican and
democratic parties.

1361
01:06:48,270 --> 01:06:51,670
Those institutions will always be there.
The content will change.

1362
01:06:52,620 --> 01:06:55,000
And,
and along the way we'll find new names,

1363
01:06:55,870 --> 01:06:56,703
but anyone politically,
I think I appreciate the compliment and 

1364
01:06:59,921 --> 01:07:02,290
I think there are some people that are 
trying to make some sense these days,

1365
01:07:02,291 --> 01:07:02,871
but really,
I mean,

1366
01:07:02,871 --> 01:07:03,704
do you think anyone politically,
I think it will start at the state 

1367
01:07:05,471 --> 01:07:06,304
level.
Um,

1368
01:07:06,580 --> 01:07:08,650
you know,
I think the mayor here in Los Angeles as

1369
01:07:08,651 --> 01:07:09,484
an example,
someone who's trying to figure out how 

1370
01:07:10,601 --> 01:07:11,680
things work.

1371
01:07:11,980 --> 01:07:14,500
Andrew Cuomo in New York,
I'm in kind of a bully,

1372
01:07:14,590 --> 01:07:15,423
but he cares about why does,
why does it cost three times as much or 

1373
01:07:18,761 --> 01:07:20,770
whatever it is to build a subway in New 
York as in London.

1374
01:07:21,180 --> 01:07:22,850
Um,
and um,

1375
01:07:23,140 --> 01:07:23,973
so I think this,
the regeneration of the American 

1376
01:07:26,351 --> 01:07:27,184
political system has always come from 
cities and states and I think that will 

1377
01:07:30,731 --> 01:07:35,050
be even more true in the 21st century.
A man here in California,

1378
01:07:35,140 --> 01:07:35,973
what you need,
you need a revival of political 

1379
01:07:37,061 --> 01:07:38,590
competition.
Uh,

1380
01:07:38,620 --> 01:07:41,510
one of the reasons why I stay a 
registered Republican is you.

1381
01:07:41,580 --> 01:07:42,413
I look at California and say,
this is what happens when you get a one 

1382
01:07:45,311 --> 01:07:47,170
party state.
You get factional politics.

1383
01:07:47,470 --> 01:07:50,800
It doesn't mitigate the problems of 
ethnically driven politics.

1384
01:07:50,801 --> 01:07:52,960
It makes them worse.
So we're gonna need,

1385
01:07:53,530 --> 01:07:57,280
we're gonna need two party competition.
We're going to need a new solutions.

1386
01:07:57,281 --> 01:07:59,230
And that's what,
that's what I try to do in my work is to

1387
01:07:59,231 --> 01:08:00,720
try to offer,
you know,

1388
01:08:00,800 --> 01:08:04,000
the,
the possibility of a more useful kind of

1389
01:08:04,001 --> 01:08:05,770
politics.
It's interesting because,

1390
01:08:06,010 --> 01:08:06,843
I mean,
that's exactly what I tried to do with 

1391
01:08:07,351 --> 01:08:08,184
the show.
And even last week I had Mike 

1392
01:08:08,801 --> 01:08:11,480
shellenberger on who's running as a 
Democrat,

1393
01:08:11,510 --> 01:08:12,343
you know,
he,

1394
01:08:12,580 --> 01:08:16,160
he's more of an old school Democrat and 
he's into nuclear power and all sorts

1395
01:08:16,160 --> 01:08:20,240
of new ideas and using technology to 
solve our problems running against Gavin

1396
01:08:20,240 --> 01:08:20,600
newsome,
who is,

1397
01:08:20,600 --> 01:08:23,450
who's the hero of the left than he 
thinks he's too left.

1398
01:08:23,510 --> 01:08:24,343
And then this week I have you on to 
discuss your frustrations with the 

1399
01:08:27,170 --> 01:08:28,610
Conservatives and all that.
So that's.

1400
01:08:28,860 --> 01:08:30,560
This is what we have to keep doing.
At the end of the day,

1401
01:08:30,590 --> 01:08:31,430
that's all we got,
right.

1402
01:08:31,570 --> 01:08:32,690
That's,
that's what I was.

1403
01:08:33,020 --> 01:08:33,853
And as long and we have to defend our 
ability to do that and defend that both 

1404
01:08:39,051 --> 01:08:39,884
against those who would use violence and
against those who would use corruption 

1405
01:08:42,590 --> 01:08:45,830
to try to shut down proper discussions.
Perfect.

1406
01:08:45,831 --> 01:08:47,630
That's a perfect ending right there.
Thank you for though,

1407
01:08:47,810 --> 01:08:49,070
I suspect.
Yeah.

1408
01:08:49,071 --> 01:08:50,660
My pleasure.
I suspect we'll do this again.

1409
01:08:50,661 --> 01:08:51,494
Maybe we'll,
we'll get ben in here and we'll do that 

1410
01:08:52,371 --> 01:08:53,204
little facts over feelings,
things that we get a couple of other 

1411
01:08:54,681 --> 01:08:57,530
people in here to to mix up some of 
these ideas for more.

1412
01:08:57,590 --> 01:08:58,423
David,
follow him on twitter at David Frum and 

1413
