1
00:00:05,170 --> 00:00:06,003
One of the things we consistently talk 
about here at the Rubin report is why 

2
00:00:08,021 --> 00:00:11,350
it's important to judge people as 
individuals and not as a collective.

3
00:00:11,380 --> 00:00:12,213
You as an individual are much more than 
your immutable characteristics be at 

4
00:00:15,371 --> 00:00:18,790
your skin color,
your religion or your sexuality to judge

5
00:00:18,791 --> 00:00:23,770
you on those characteristics is actually
what the essence of prejudice really is.

6
00:00:24,010 --> 00:00:24,843
Prejudice of course means to prejudge,
so if you look at a black person or a 

7
00:00:28,151 --> 00:00:32,140
Muslim person or a gay person and think 
that you know what they think,

8
00:00:32,141 --> 00:00:36,010
or more importantly how they should 
think based on those characteristics,

9
00:00:36,250 --> 00:00:39,220
then you are actually the one who's 
being prejudiced.

10
00:00:39,730 --> 00:00:40,563
Sadly,
many of the people who accuse others of 

11
00:00:42,071 --> 00:00:42,904
bigotry and racism these days are often 
the people who practice this brand of 

12
00:00:46,061 --> 00:00:49,990
prejudice the most without even 
realizing that they're doing so.

13
00:00:50,230 --> 00:00:52,750
Just look at some of the things that my 
friends Larry elder,

14
00:00:52,751 --> 00:00:57,370
my [inaudible] and Ion Hirsi Ali or 
called by the so called tolerance side.

15
00:00:58,030 --> 00:00:58,863
When you look at a group of people and 
you think you know what they should 

16
00:01:01,630 --> 00:01:02,463
think or what's best for them based on 
those outward characteristics and now 

17
00:01:05,891 --> 00:01:06,724
what's going on in their own minds.
You not only lock people into your 

18
00:01:09,911 --> 00:01:10,744
preconceived notions of what they are,
but stifle the voices of the minorities 

19
00:01:15,011 --> 00:01:15,844
within these minorities.
This is why the voices of black 

20
00:01:18,401 --> 00:01:20,770
conservatives and gay Muslims,
for example,

21
00:01:20,771 --> 00:01:25,210
are so relevant and interesting today.
If you really listen to these minorities

22
00:01:25,211 --> 00:01:26,044
within the minorities,
you will judge these people on their 

23
00:01:28,511 --> 00:01:29,830
thoughts,
their logic,

24
00:01:29,831 --> 00:01:33,790
and their reason instead of simply how 
they look or who they love.

25
00:01:34,090 --> 00:01:34,923
In a way,
the very existence of BS freethinkers 

26
00:01:36,971 --> 00:01:40,750
within these minority communities,
flips identity politics on its head,

27
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:44,740
showing the flaws of this postmodern 
intersectional way of thinking.

28
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:45,993
Just see how quickly those who preach 
identity politics turn on black or 

29
00:01:48,881 --> 00:01:49,714
Latino people who have conservative 
political beliefs or how easily they 

30
00:01:53,171 --> 00:01:54,004
dismiss gays are women who dare talk 
about how poorly they're treated in 

31
00:01:57,521 --> 00:01:58,750
Islamic societies.

32
00:01:59,080 --> 00:01:59,913
Identity.
Politics only works if you believe that 

33
00:02:02,051 --> 00:02:02,884
the most important quality about each of
us are the attributes which we are born 

34
00:02:06,491 --> 00:02:10,960
with thus cannot change rather than the 
ideas which we come to learn.

35
00:02:11,230 --> 00:02:12,063
I view this twisted ideology as a true 
existential danger for the tolerant and 

36
00:02:16,121 --> 00:02:16,954
Liberal,
albeit flawed country that America is 

37
00:02:19,630 --> 00:02:20,463
Martin Luther King,
Jr's desire for his children to be 

38
00:02:22,481 --> 00:02:26,890
judged by the content of their character
and not the color of their skin is being

39
00:02:26,891 --> 00:02:30,790
undermined by the very people who 
purport to be the tolerant ones.

40
00:02:31,570 --> 00:02:32,403
We're continuing our partnership with 
learn liberty today and joining me is 

41
00:02:34,601 --> 00:02:37,270
the CEO of the Thurgood Marshall College
Fund,

42
00:02:37,271 --> 00:02:38,104
Johnny c Dot Taylor.
The organization represents nearly 

43
00:02:40,301 --> 00:02:41,134
300,000
students who attend the 47 historical 

44
00:02:44,021 --> 00:02:44,854
black colleges in America today.
I heard Johnny speak at an event in 

45
00:02:47,741 --> 00:02:50,890
Dallas a couple months ago and was blown
away by his passion,

46
00:02:51,100 --> 00:02:51,933
his commitment to educating young people
and his desire to move past identity 

47
00:02:55,811 --> 00:02:58,210
politics.
We're going to talk about politics,

48
00:02:58,211 --> 00:02:59,080
race,
and much.

49
00:02:59,740 --> 00:02:59,980
Has

50
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:00,813
the role of the Black College changed as
we've become a more fair injustice 

51
00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:05,693
society.
That's just one of the many questions 

52
00:03:06,881 --> 00:03:11,110
I'll ask johnny and I'll only judge him 
by the content of his answers,

53
00:03:11,350 --> 00:03:12,520
not the color of his skin.

54
00:03:17,810 --> 00:03:18,643
We're continuing our partnership with 
learn liberty today and joining me is 

55
00:03:20,931 --> 00:03:24,520
the president and CEO of the Thurgood 
Marshall Scholarship Fund,

56
00:03:24,521 --> 00:03:28,310
but the only national organization 
representing the nearly 300,000

57
00:03:28,311 --> 00:03:32,720
students attending America's 47 
historically black colleges.

58
00:03:33,050 --> 00:03:34,970
Johnny c Dot Taylor.
Welcome to the Rubin report.

59
00:03:35,060 --> 00:03:37,280
So glad to be here.
I gotta tell you man,

60
00:03:37,281 --> 00:03:39,260
I and I just did tell you,
but now I'll repeat it.

61
00:03:39,261 --> 00:03:40,094
Since the cameras are on you.
We've been doing this thing with learn 

62
00:03:41,841 --> 00:03:42,674
liberty for a little over a year or so 
and they've sent us some great authors 

63
00:03:45,561 --> 00:03:48,960
and professors and thinkers.
I've never requested anyone.

64
00:03:49,130 --> 00:03:49,963
User are the first person I requested 
because I saw you speak a couple of 

65
00:03:53,841 --> 00:03:56,210
months back at a conference for 
academics.

66
00:03:56,211 --> 00:03:57,044
Had to do a lot about free speech and 
liberty and all sorts of things and you 

67
00:03:59,871 --> 00:04:02,870
gave the keynote address on the final 
night and I thought,

68
00:04:02,900 --> 00:04:07,900
this guy is possibly the most passionate
speaker I've ever seen in my life.

69
00:04:09,310 --> 00:04:11,300
Thank you.
Where does that passion come from?

70
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:12,980
Well,
let's start there.

71
00:04:12,981 --> 00:04:14,330
Before we even talking about what you 
do,

72
00:04:14,331 --> 00:04:16,580
just the passion that you had.
I was just like that.

73
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:17,900
I got to get that guy on the show.

74
00:04:17,970 --> 00:04:18,930
See,
it's interesting.

75
00:04:18,931 --> 00:04:22,020
I spent my career in the entertainment 
space,

76
00:04:22,021 --> 00:04:24,330
the media space,
paramount pictures,

77
00:04:24,331 --> 00:04:25,470
spelling,
entertainment,

78
00:04:25,471 --> 00:04:29,370
blockbuster entertainment.
So all of my life was doing that kind of

79
00:04:29,371 --> 00:04:30,270
stuff,
making money,

80
00:04:31,150 --> 00:04:31,983
right?
But I always had this yearning for the 

81
00:04:35,401 --> 00:04:39,400
community and how higher education could
play into him.

82
00:04:39,690 --> 00:04:41,910
Sort of fixing what was going on in my 
community.

83
00:04:42,090 --> 00:04:44,430
And I say the community,
I mean all of Americans,

84
00:04:44,431 --> 00:04:45,264
but particularly African Americans.
And there were so many conversations 

85
00:04:48,241 --> 00:04:51,480
that didn't occur,
weren't allowed to occur.

86
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:52,583
And so I took this new role at the 
Thurgood Marshall College Fund 

87
00:04:54,990 --> 00:04:57,660
representing Black Colleges.
I didn't attend a black college.

88
00:04:57,810 --> 00:04:58,643
Um,
I often say I'm a beneficiary of it 

89
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:03,120
because so many of my teachers and 
doctors and lawyers did,

90
00:05:03,121 --> 00:05:03,954
but I didn't,
my parents didn't attend a black 

91
00:05:05,191 --> 00:05:06,024
college,
but I thought this was such an 

92
00:05:07,771 --> 00:05:11,990
opportunity to come in and really begin 
to influence how young people are,

93
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:12,853
our future leaders,
how they think about the world and then 

94
00:05:15,121 --> 00:05:18,630
to challenge them.
My legal education by definition sort of

95
00:05:18,631 --> 00:05:19,464
taught me to challenge the status quo,
to be able to argue both sides or in 

96
00:05:22,290 --> 00:05:24,540
some instances three sides of any 
argument.

97
00:05:24,990 --> 00:05:27,720
And so that's where it came from.
I really,

98
00:05:27,810 --> 00:05:28,643
I,
I don't sleep at night sometimes 

99
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:34,350
thinking about where America is headed 
and that's where the passion comes from.

100
00:05:34,351 --> 00:05:37,320
I'm genuinely concerned about where 
we're going.

101
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:38,900
Yeah,
I feel that too.

102
00:05:38,901 --> 00:05:39,734
And we kind of hit that a little bit 
before and now we've got to do it all 

103
00:05:41,671 --> 00:05:43,270
over right now.
Um,

104
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:46,380
tell me a little bit more about your 
resume before we get to what you've been

105
00:05:46,381 --> 00:05:48,420
doing these last couple of years because
yeah,

106
00:05:48,421 --> 00:05:49,620
you just mentioned some of that stuff.
I mean,

107
00:05:49,621 --> 00:05:52,450
you've got a pretty prime.
Your linkedin has got to be pretty fat,

108
00:05:53,060 --> 00:05:55,590
less on what,
like eight pages that God is good.

109
00:05:56,690 --> 00:05:57,980
But tell a little bit about that because
I

110
00:05:57,980 --> 00:06:00,530
think it does form Sorta,
you know,

111
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:01,880
how you end up sitting across from me 
here.

112
00:06:02,030 --> 00:06:03,410
So I began my career.
Well,

113
00:06:03,411 --> 00:06:04,244
let me back up.
I did the undergraduate work at the 

114
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:07,280
University of Miami.
I'm a born and raised in Florida,

115
00:06:07,281 --> 00:06:08,114
so I'm the.
You got to give him a shout out to my 

116
00:06:09,651 --> 00:06:10,750
school.
Um,

117
00:06:10,790 --> 00:06:12,140
in any event.
I finished school,

118
00:06:12,141 --> 00:06:14,930
went to law school in Iowa at Drake 
University.

119
00:06:15,170 --> 00:06:17,900
I came back to south Florida to practice
at a big law firm.

120
00:06:18,230 --> 00:06:21,110
Janet Reno was one of my,
was the first female partner.

121
00:06:21,111 --> 00:06:23,030
So I'm dating myself and takes your way 
back.

122
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:26,210
And then began my practice,
sat on a plane one day,

123
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:27,290
melt,
met A.

124
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:29,670
I did not know at the time of 
billionaire Wayne Highs,

125
00:06:29,700 --> 00:06:33,740
Zynga who had this small little business
called blockbuster that he was building.

126
00:06:33,741 --> 00:06:34,574
I went in as the third lawyer on staff 
and literally we went through this huge 

127
00:06:38,091 --> 00:06:38,924
acquisition spree and you know,
you remember blockbuster was on every 

128
00:06:41,331 --> 00:06:41,600
corner.

129
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:44,240
It's the biggest so did that.
Viacom bought us,

130
00:06:44,270 --> 00:06:45,103
so I've spent my time as a lawyer,
as an hr executive and then ultimately 

131
00:06:49,190 --> 00:06:52,520
once by combat us and worked for sumner 
at Viacom,

132
00:06:52,521 --> 00:06:54,440
Sumner Redstone,
and then uh,

133
00:06:54,530 --> 00:06:57,080
my last corporate gig was running a 
business,

134
00:06:57,081 --> 00:06:59,450
a subsidiary for Barry Diller in New 
York.

135
00:06:59,451 --> 00:07:00,284
So I literally have had all of the back 
office functions and then ran frontline 

136
00:07:03,981 --> 00:07:08,981
operator running a business for Barry,
came to TMC in 2010 as the CEO.

137
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:13,430
So you've been doing this for now about 
seven years and you're actually about to

138
00:07:13,431 --> 00:07:16,880
shift into something else which will,
which will get to a little later,

139
00:07:17,390 --> 00:07:21,350
but tell me a little bit about what the 
scholarship climb to actually does.

140
00:07:21,351 --> 00:07:22,184
What is the purpose?
Because I know a certain amount of 

141
00:07:23,571 --> 00:07:24,404
people,
because I know a lot of your thoughts 

142
00:07:25,101 --> 00:07:25,934
on,
on the diversity memo and all that 

143
00:07:27,381 --> 00:07:27,740
stuff.

144
00:07:27,740 --> 00:07:31,880
It almost sounds counter to what the 
Thurgood Marshall Scholarship Fund might

145
00:07:31,910 --> 00:07:32,750
do.
Right?

146
00:07:32,751 --> 00:07:34,910
So the,
the college fund was actually created by

147
00:07:34,911 --> 00:07:35,744
the way we were created as the 
Scholarship Fund Thurgood Marshall 

148
00:07:38,031 --> 00:07:41,690
Scholarship Fund about a decade ago.
We changed the name to broaden the remit

149
00:07:41,930 --> 00:07:42,763
to the college funds,
so it's Thurgood Marshall College Fund 

150
00:07:45,020 --> 00:07:48,290
and we really only do four things 
scholarships.

151
00:07:48,291 --> 00:07:52,070
We provide scholarships for the 
absolutely most talented students,

152
00:07:52,071 --> 00:07:56,960
so this is not sort of a social services
feel good for kids who didn't get a shot

153
00:07:56,990 --> 00:08:00,080
k through 12.
These are the brightest kids who frankly

154
00:08:00,081 --> 00:08:00,914
just have money problems they need,
so scholarships that are needing and 

155
00:08:04,190 --> 00:08:08,810
sort of need and merit based.
Then capacity building.

156
00:08:09,050 --> 00:08:10,910
We've talked with our schools a lot 
about.

157
00:08:10,940 --> 00:08:13,520
There was a time when HPC use captive 
market.

158
00:08:13,521 --> 00:08:15,110
If you were black and you want to go to 
college,

159
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:17,090
you attended a black college.
Well,

160
00:08:17,150 --> 00:08:18,080
everything changed.

161
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:20,480
Be careful what you pray for it.
We asked for diversity,

162
00:08:20,630 --> 00:08:22,340
we got it.
We asked her integration,

163
00:08:22,341 --> 00:08:23,174
we got it,
and so now black students have options 

164
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:25,873
and so black colleges,
historically black colleges have got to 

165
00:08:27,981 --> 00:08:28,814
step up.
So the second thing is to build their 

166
00:08:30,081 --> 00:08:30,914
capacity to be attractive.
The third thing that we do as 

167
00:08:32,781 --> 00:08:36,320
governmental affairs,
I mean a lot of abic advocacy and policy

168
00:08:36,321 --> 00:08:39,350
work to make sure that we're not making 
emotional decisions.

169
00:08:39,351 --> 00:08:40,184
We want to do what is good for our 
communities and what's good for this 

170
00:08:42,981 --> 00:08:43,814
country.
Those are really the three things that 

171
00:08:45,471 --> 00:08:48,890
we focus on as,
as a fund and that's the work that we do

172
00:08:49,150 --> 00:08:49,983
and the thing that most of the folks 
frankly don't realize is historically 

173
00:08:53,421 --> 00:08:58,110
black colleges are not ebc.
They're not exclusively black colleges.

174
00:08:58,111 --> 00:09:01,590
In fact,
for currently four of our member schools

175
00:09:01,620 --> 00:09:04,050
are majority white,
really majority white.

176
00:09:04,060 --> 00:09:04,893
So they are still historically black 
colleges because the hbcus historically 

177
00:09:08,191 --> 00:09:10,350
black,
not necessarily currently blank.

178
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:12,930
So West Virginia State and Bluefield 
State College,

179
00:09:12,931 --> 00:09:16,110
both in West Virginia,
Lincoln University in Missouri,

180
00:09:16,530 --> 00:09:18,300
Kentucky State,
uh,

181
00:09:18,330 --> 00:09:22,920
these are schools that while technically
are not technically are actually hpc use

182
00:09:23,180 --> 00:09:24,013
are,
have more white students than black 

183
00:09:24,931 --> 00:09:25,764
students.
And those are some of the things that 

184
00:09:26,910 --> 00:09:29,960
people don't understand.
This is not about race per se.

185
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:31,433
How much battling is there over what it 
means to be historically black versus 

186
00:09:35,850 --> 00:09:38,730
currently diverse?
Because I would imagine you've got,

187
00:09:38,790 --> 00:09:39,623
you know,
ideas and academics and administrators 

188
00:09:41,641 --> 00:09:44,040
who were probably pretty entrenched in 
keeping things,

189
00:09:44,041 --> 00:09:44,874
just looking at it by numbers,
not necessarily diversity of thought 

190
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:47,993
that's and all that.
So you must be dealing with that 

191
00:09:48,721 --> 00:09:49,291
constant.
Oh,

192
00:09:49,291 --> 00:09:50,250
you have no idea.

193
00:09:52,620 --> 00:09:53,453
That's ugly.
And it's interesting because I'm 

194
00:09:56,371 --> 00:09:57,204
surprised,
and I know we'll talk about some of 

195
00:09:58,501 --> 00:09:59,334
this,
but I'm surprised at the number you'd 

196
00:10:00,331 --> 00:10:01,650
like to think millennials,
you know,

197
00:10:01,651 --> 00:10:02,484
we think millennials and we group them 
in and they're open and they're diverse 

198
00:10:05,011 --> 00:10:05,910
in there.
Well,

199
00:10:05,911 --> 00:10:09,510
I was surprised we've had some students 
really not faculty,

200
00:10:09,511 --> 00:10:11,550
not alumni,
but students,

201
00:10:11,551 --> 00:10:12,384
18 or 19 year olds take great issue with
the fact that the institutions are more 

202
00:10:16,411 --> 00:10:17,244
diverse than they were.
They wanted to come to an all black 

203
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:20,273
institution and we get there and realize
that we have international students and 

204
00:10:22,740 --> 00:10:26,250
white students and Hispanic students.
They really push back.

205
00:10:26,251 --> 00:10:29,580
So that's been a real surprise to me.
How do you break through that?

206
00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:31,080
Well,
you continue.

207
00:10:31,081 --> 00:10:31,914
First of all,
you explained to them that Hbcu is not 

208
00:10:33,511 --> 00:10:34,344
ABC.
Then you start with that and you also 

209
00:10:35,881 --> 00:10:36,714
then explain,
I find myself oftentimes when I'm 

210
00:10:38,851 --> 00:10:39,684
talking to them saying,
let me just put yourself in this 

211
00:10:41,911 --> 00:10:44,310
situation.
So just recently one of our campuses,

212
00:10:44,550 --> 00:10:45,383
one of a group of students were really 
upset because in fact it was all over 

213
00:10:48,181 --> 00:10:49,014
the national news about students came on
the campus of Howard University wearing 

214
00:10:51,781 --> 00:10:53,400
the make America great again.

215
00:10:55,700 --> 00:10:56,290
And I said,
no,

216
00:10:56,290 --> 00:10:58,710
I just wanted the student leaders.
I pulled to the sadness.

217
00:10:58,711 --> 00:11:00,540
I don't want you to just for a second to
ask me,

218
00:11:00,541 --> 00:11:01,374
how do you think this would play out 
group of black students right after 

219
00:11:03,590 --> 00:11:06,390
Obama elected go visit Liberty 
University's campus.

220
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:07,433
They have on the wonderful Obama tee 
shirts where they're proud of this new 

221
00:11:09,751 --> 00:11:12,930
president and they were literally run 
off of campus.

222
00:11:12,931 --> 00:11:15,270
They were threatened,
they were harassed.

223
00:11:15,450 --> 00:11:16,283
How do you think that will go over?
And so what I find myself doing is she 

224
00:11:19,590 --> 00:11:20,423
just literally put yourself in that 
situation and tell me why this is that 

225
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:25,980
different.
Um,

226
00:11:26,190 --> 00:11:28,410
and then you get that pause,
that moment.

227
00:11:28,530 --> 00:11:29,363
By the way,
that's what motivates me to do my work 

228
00:11:30,661 --> 00:11:31,494
because that's the way you influence the
sort of the narrative and how these 

229
00:11:34,831 --> 00:11:36,630
young people think.
You have to just stop and say,

230
00:11:36,631 --> 00:11:39,480
I get how you feel right now emotionally
about this,

231
00:11:39,690 --> 00:11:40,523
but for just a second,
let's flip the script and tell me how 

232
00:11:43,021 --> 00:11:43,854
this works.

233
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:45,510
And you're smart,
you're bright.

234
00:11:46,170 --> 00:11:47,003
Tell me how this works out.
That's really part of what motivates me 

235
00:11:49,711 --> 00:11:50,780
to do the work.
Yeah.

236
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:52,300
And that's what we need more of,
right?

237
00:11:52,301 --> 00:11:55,950
I mean because everybody seems hysterics
hysterical over,

238
00:11:56,020 --> 00:11:57,520
over emotional.
So that's like.

239
00:11:57,570 --> 00:11:58,403
It's like I can understand that if I,
if I was black and I wanted to go to a 

240
00:12:01,511 --> 00:12:02,344
historically black college and I got 
there and I thought it was going to be 

241
00:12:05,020 --> 00:12:07,000
80 percent black and I got there and I 
was like,

242
00:12:07,001 --> 00:12:07,551
wait a minute,
I'm,

243
00:12:07,551 --> 00:12:11,530
I'm actually still a minority here.
The emotional part,

244
00:12:11,531 --> 00:12:14,470
I can understand it being like,
this doesn't feel right to me,

245
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:17,200
but then when you hear that and you go,
well,

246
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:19,910
things actually are changing.
Integration is this,

247
00:12:19,940 --> 00:12:21,310
this is all good.
This is,

248
00:12:21,390 --> 00:12:24,630
this is the purpose,
the purpose of freedom prayed for it.

249
00:12:25,420 --> 00:12:27,370
I often say,
be careful what you pray for.

250
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:28,233
This is exactly what we said we wanted,
is the opportunity to choose kind of 

251
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:35,230
what I can tell you.
That's when my great grandparents,

252
00:12:35,231 --> 00:12:36,790
yeah.
In fact,

253
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:40,120
Thurgood Marshall himself for folks 
don't realize this.

254
00:12:40,121 --> 00:12:42,820
Thurgood Marshall didn't choose to go to
Howard University.

255
00:12:42,821 --> 00:12:44,820
Law School,
Thurgood Marshall.

256
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:47,500
Fact of the matter is applied to the 
University of Maryland,

257
00:12:47,590 --> 00:12:48,423
was denied admission to that law school.
Went to Howard because it was the 

258
00:12:52,391 --> 00:12:55,000
college for black students and law 
schools for black students,

259
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:59,050
and so you just have to think about it.
He then subsequently brought lawsuits to

260
00:12:59,051 --> 00:13:00,970
actually stop that very thing.
Again,

261
00:13:00,971 --> 00:13:03,910
this was an anti Hbcu.
The message was,

262
00:13:03,911 --> 00:13:08,470
I want to be able to choose irrespective
of my skin color where I go to school,

263
00:13:08,620 --> 00:13:12,190
so all of us should have predicted that 
we would be right where we are today.

264
00:13:12,610 --> 00:13:13,443
What I find is the young folks just 
don't understand the history and then 

265
00:13:15,431 --> 00:13:17,500
the older people refuse to tell.

266
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:19,690
The honest is,
so what's going on there?

267
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:21,850
Because I don't believe there is so much
nonsense.

268
00:13:21,851 --> 00:13:24,170
The media is so complicit in this.
Yes.

269
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:25,060
Um,
I,

270
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:25,841
I don't,
you know,

271
00:13:25,841 --> 00:13:26,674
and,
and identity politics has become so 

272
00:13:27,821 --> 00:13:31,240
rooted in everything that I don't blame 
the young people who are misguided.

273
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:33,380
Yeah.
I want to get through to them and,

274
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:34,233
and all that.
It's the other people that you're 

275
00:13:35,831 --> 00:13:36,664
talking about,
the older people on the academics that 

276
00:13:37,601 --> 00:13:39,310
are afraid to speak.
What happened there?

277
00:13:39,311 --> 00:13:40,710
Did you see it change?
I,

278
00:13:40,740 --> 00:13:42,220
I did.
I saw it,

279
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:43,030
you know,
and,

280
00:13:43,030 --> 00:13:44,650
and where I,
when I was in school,

281
00:13:44,651 --> 00:13:47,050
you were encouraged to be a little bit 
of a provocateur.

282
00:13:47,410 --> 00:13:49,150
Always respectfully.
You never.

283
00:13:49,151 --> 00:13:49,984
There was no,
no one wanted you to go out and hurt 

284
00:13:51,491 --> 00:13:53,860
someone's feelings.
But we were encouraged in law school for

285
00:13:53,861 --> 00:13:54,694
example,
to look at things from all different 

286
00:13:56,141 --> 00:13:57,070
sorts of perspectives.

287
00:13:57,070 --> 00:14:00,100
I was given a case once where you'd have
to represent the plaintiff and then turn

288
00:14:00,101 --> 00:14:02,250
around and go against,
you know,

289
00:14:02,540 --> 00:14:03,373
defend him.
So we've just lost that in education 

290
00:14:05,861 --> 00:14:06,694
now.
And then I got to tell you more and 

291
00:14:07,811 --> 00:14:09,550
more,
I'm talking to students who say,

292
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:11,140
you know,
I feel a certain way,

293
00:14:11,141 --> 00:14:11,974
but I know that if I either uttered 
those my thoughts even in a question 

294
00:14:15,701 --> 00:14:19,480
format in the classroom,
I'd be attacked by from my professor.

295
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:23,380
It would impact my participation in 
class green that Po,

296
00:14:23,410 --> 00:14:25,000
that portion of my grade.
Also.

297
00:14:25,001 --> 00:14:25,834
And more importantly,
what do you say to kids say when they 

298
00:14:27,611 --> 00:14:29,230
say that perhaps you're at the wrong 
school?

299
00:14:29,650 --> 00:14:31,270
I said,
you got to vote with your feet.

300
00:14:31,660 --> 00:14:32,493
Colleges not about,
it's supposed to be a time to explore 

301
00:14:35,020 --> 00:14:35,853
and to grow.
If you already knew what you needed to 

302
00:14:38,441 --> 00:14:41,530
know to sort of live in life and be 
successful,

303
00:14:41,650 --> 00:14:42,483
then you don't need to spend five or six
years and hundreds of thousands of 

304
00:14:44,351 --> 00:14:44,980
dollars.

305
00:14:44,980 --> 00:14:45,813
If you are the same person that you 
walked in the door at the end of your 

306
00:14:48,671 --> 00:14:50,050
freshman year,
um,

307
00:14:50,140 --> 00:14:52,430
then you were cheated.
And I tell them,

308
00:14:52,460 --> 00:14:55,550
you should challenge the institution to 
give you a better education.

309
00:14:55,700 --> 00:15:00,530
And sometimes that the way you get 
better is to have to confront ideas that

310
00:15:00,531 --> 00:15:04,100
you don't necessarily embrace.
You don't understand them.

311
00:15:04,610 --> 00:15:06,680
One situation that that sort of comes 
up,

312
00:15:06,681 --> 00:15:09,880
and I think it helps my students a lot.
Understand where I come from us.

313
00:15:09,881 --> 00:15:10,161
It's,
you know,

314
00:15:10,161 --> 00:15:10,994
listen,
I was an employment lawyer early in my 

315
00:15:12,141 --> 00:15:15,140
career and at that time there was a big 
question,

316
00:15:15,141 --> 00:15:18,800
for example,
around whether or not gay,

317
00:15:18,860 --> 00:15:22,130
lesbian sexual orientation was covered 
under title seven.

318
00:15:22,220 --> 00:15:23,450
Okay.
Big Question.

319
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:27,770
Gender and sex was clear if you were 
being discriminated against on the basis

320
00:15:27,771 --> 00:15:28,604
of something else.
That on sort of sexual orientation that 

321
00:15:30,051 --> 00:15:30,884
wasn't covered.

322
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:33,920
I actually brought those cases and made 
those arguments.

323
00:15:33,921 --> 00:15:35,220
I defended them,
that they,

324
00:15:35,260 --> 00:15:38,840
she was not the intent of the congress 
and this was ridiculous,

325
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:41,540
etc.
That gender is something that's innate.

326
00:15:41,570 --> 00:15:43,700
You're born That way and low gay and 
lesbian,

327
00:15:43,701 --> 00:15:46,250
maybe not so much.
Fast forward.

328
00:15:46,330 --> 00:15:48,560
Where are we?
That's 1992.

329
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:51,890
I think it's important that context.
That's right.

330
00:15:51,891 --> 00:15:52,820
Put it in context.
Now,

331
00:15:53,180 --> 00:15:56,210
fast forward,
you began to evolve and grow.

332
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:57,073
You start sitting down and getting to 
know people who are different than you 

333
00:16:00,231 --> 00:16:02,680
are or that your family is or that you,
you,

334
00:16:02,730 --> 00:16:03,563
you just,
you began to evolve and it challenges 

335
00:16:05,451 --> 00:16:06,284
your own notions of what is right and 
what is wrong and maybe you conclude 

336
00:16:09,981 --> 00:16:14,030
there is no right or wrong here.
This is just life that we're evolving as

337
00:16:14,031 --> 00:16:16,490
a human species,
kind of even.

338
00:16:16,491 --> 00:16:20,840
I've had to do that and there are so 
many instances of that in my own life,

339
00:16:20,841 --> 00:16:21,674
and so when you begin to have 
conversations in the context of the 

340
00:16:24,531 --> 00:16:27,170
classroom with students,
you see the growth.

341
00:16:27,410 --> 00:16:29,720
That's the beautY.
That shouldn't be the beauty of it.

342
00:16:29,721 --> 00:16:31,910
Instead,
what I'm seeing more and more,

343
00:16:31,911 --> 00:16:35,030
david is there actually retarding the 
growth students.

344
00:16:35,060 --> 00:16:38,690
You're not encouraged to think.
You come in thinking a certain way.

345
00:16:38,691 --> 00:16:40,460
Your professors want you to think a 
certain way.

346
00:16:40,610 --> 00:16:42,890
Your institution wants you to think a 
certain way,

347
00:16:43,100 --> 00:16:43,933
but here's the problem.
The real problem is then you go to work 

348
00:16:47,180 --> 00:16:48,013
and you have to confront the reality of 
you know you're not protected in this 

349
00:16:51,561 --> 00:16:52,394
bubble.
You've got to live and work next to 

350
00:16:53,841 --> 00:16:56,760
people who don't look like you,
and frankly that's a challenge.

351
00:16:56,780 --> 00:16:58,250
That's something that people talk about 
a lot.

352
00:16:58,280 --> 00:17:00,410
when I talk about black colleges,
the only.

353
00:17:00,411 --> 00:17:04,400
I don't question the relevancy of hbcs.
I think that's a dumb argument.

354
00:17:04,401 --> 00:17:09,020
It's a dumb question.
There is a fair question that is posed.

355
00:17:09,080 --> 00:17:11,930
If you have gone to a black elementary 
school,

356
00:17:11,990 --> 00:17:12,823
middle school,
grew up in a black community and then 

357
00:17:14,601 --> 00:17:15,740
you went to a black college.

358
00:17:15,890 --> 00:17:20,120
The first meaningful interaction that 
you had with people who are not black is

359
00:17:20,170 --> 00:17:21,003
in the workplace.
You're going to be at a disadvantage 

360
00:17:23,540 --> 00:17:28,280
just practically speaking and so you it.
It has some downside,

361
00:17:28,310 --> 00:17:29,840
tons of upside.
By the way,

362
00:17:29,841 --> 00:17:31,760
being a majority and a minority 
community.

363
00:17:31,910 --> 00:17:36,110
black colleges give you a very special 
and nurturing environment to grow in,

364
00:17:37,190 --> 00:17:39,120
but there's a cost to that.
Yeah.

365
00:17:39,230 --> 00:17:44,230
Is that just the natural evolution of 
the way humans are,

366
00:17:44,301 --> 00:17:48,860
that if you have a legit grievance,
you may need a different place.

367
00:17:48,870 --> 00:17:52,350
Or for thurgood marshall who did not get
accepted to the Maryland law school,

368
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:56,070
so he needed a place to go to completely
legit in that time and place,

369
00:17:56,220 --> 00:17:59,010
but that eventually we,
if a quality works,

370
00:17:59,011 --> 00:18:01,110
because the arc does bend towards 
justice,

371
00:18:01,410 --> 00:18:03,840
that eventually you slowly need these 
things less.

372
00:18:03,841 --> 00:18:06,060
It doesn't mean that there's no use For 
them,

373
00:18:06,300 --> 00:18:06,690
but you.

374
00:18:06,690 --> 00:18:07,523
But a lot of people are sort of addicted
to that original pain or instance or 

375
00:18:11,251 --> 00:18:13,290
whatever you want to call it.
You nailed it.

376
00:18:13,291 --> 00:18:15,120
I mean that.
None of us.

377
00:18:15,990 --> 00:18:16,860
It's,
it's,

378
00:18:16,890 --> 00:18:17,970
it's addictive.
I mean,

379
00:18:17,971 --> 00:18:18,804
that's the problem.
And Weaning yourself off of that is 

380
00:18:21,091 --> 00:18:24,570
difficult and that's not limited to 
black people or any group of people.

381
00:18:24,571 --> 00:18:28,470
It's just that you get used to it.
And this notion that we were to create.

382
00:18:28,471 --> 00:18:32,520
Remember even the concept of affirmative
action was supposed to be remedial.

383
00:18:32,940 --> 00:18:35,340
It was not supposed to go on forever.
Right?

384
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:36,473
BuT what happens is if you get used to 
it and it's a benefit that a new words 

385
00:18:39,040 --> 00:18:41,390
to you and people who look like you,
um,

386
00:18:41,580 --> 00:18:43,680
it's really tough to one day say,
okay,

387
00:18:43,740 --> 00:18:45,960
that's done.
I have a seven year old daughter and I,

388
00:18:45,961 --> 00:18:46,794
you know,
there's a point at which she's going to 

389
00:18:47,701 --> 00:18:51,930
come off of daddy's credit card and she 
was going to fight me if it's 18,

390
00:18:51,931 --> 00:18:52,764
if it's 28 of his 38,
the day that I decide you now have to 

391
00:18:55,561 --> 00:18:57,630
leave the nest and figure this out 
yourself.

392
00:18:57,690 --> 00:19:00,160
If it's 38,
if I move in with your dog.

393
00:19:00,290 --> 00:19:01,710
Right.
But you're right,

394
00:19:01,740 --> 00:19:03,270
you're onto something that,
that's,

395
00:19:03,271 --> 00:19:06,030
um,
it's even think about just in real life.

396
00:19:06,170 --> 00:19:10,560
that's the thing that I'm intrigued by 
is I could not wait until I turned 18.

397
00:19:11,650 --> 00:19:12,483
I could leave my nest and my mama and my
daddy's house and go and start creating 

398
00:19:16,351 --> 00:19:19,650
my own.
And I'm seeing some of them for economic

399
00:19:19,651 --> 00:19:20,484
reasons,
but just everyone's sort of staying at 

400
00:19:22,561 --> 00:19:26,460
home and they want.
It's a very different world that we live

401
00:19:26,461 --> 00:19:28,350
in right now and I'm intrigued by it.
Yeah.

402
00:19:28,380 --> 00:19:32,220
How much of this also is about the 
family in general?

403
00:19:32,221 --> 00:19:34,140
That's one of the things when I've had a
couple,

404
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:36,900
particularly in this case,
when I've had black conservatives on,

405
00:19:37,040 --> 00:19:38,340
you know,
like larry elder,

406
00:19:38,341 --> 00:19:40,730
talking about the black family you just 
mentioned,

407
00:19:40,731 --> 00:19:42,910
you mentioned your mom and your dad,
so I,

408
00:19:42,911 --> 00:19:44,250
I suspect they're still married.

409
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:46,050
No.
Okay,

410
00:19:46,070 --> 00:19:48,690
so that's interesting.
But they were for obviously most of your

411
00:19:49,170 --> 00:19:50,003
childhood.
Mr.

412
00:19:50,100 --> 00:19:52,800
How much of that structure is related to
all of this?

413
00:19:52,801 --> 00:19:53,634
Why then you can't necessarily deal with
outside influences or or any of that 

414
00:19:58,291 --> 00:20:00,000
stuff.
So I struggle with that.

415
00:20:00,001 --> 00:20:03,870
I struggle with that because because of 
the realities of slavery,

416
00:20:04,410 --> 00:20:08,040
the black community was always largely 
maternally run.

417
00:20:08,670 --> 00:20:10,770
Dad and mom were separated.
Family,

418
00:20:10,771 --> 00:20:11,604
the family unit in the traditional sense
didn't exist so and we were successful 

419
00:20:15,511 --> 00:20:17,260
in spite of that.
So I,

420
00:20:17,370 --> 00:20:20,370
I'm noT so sure that I now what I all 
day.

421
00:20:20,371 --> 00:20:21,204
I think the value of having mom and dad 
in the home and and frankly at some 

422
00:20:24,271 --> 00:20:25,104
point grandparents and home to build 
that in that I think it's incredibly 

423
00:20:27,661 --> 00:20:28,494
important,
but I'm not prepared to say that's why 

424
00:20:30,961 --> 00:20:32,520
everything is wrong.
As I pointed out,

425
00:20:32,521 --> 00:20:33,354
my parents ultimately got,
were divorced and all to have two 

426
00:20:36,001 --> 00:20:37,500
sisters.
We both went to college.

427
00:20:37,501 --> 00:20:40,100
All three of us rather were successful,
have great lives.

428
00:20:40,120 --> 00:20:42,900
Nobody's been to jail.
No one has eight kids that you know,

429
00:20:43,050 --> 00:20:47,100
so I don't know that I'm Prepared to say
that.

430
00:20:47,110 --> 00:20:48,310
It's totally about

431
00:20:48,310 --> 00:20:50,170
sort of the family unit.
I think family,

432
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:51,033
the one thing that I'm happy to see now,
his family is being more broadly 

433
00:20:53,681 --> 00:20:54,514
defined.
We and our community oftentimes talk 

434
00:20:56,981 --> 00:20:57,814
about it takes a village and the family 
could be the little old lady cross the 

435
00:21:01,511 --> 00:21:03,070
street.
If you don't know your grandmother,

436
00:21:03,071 --> 00:21:08,071
she might essentially become your 
grandma in local parentes the concept in

437
00:21:08,561 --> 00:21:09,394
latin that there a whole bunch of folks 
who act as parents to make it all 

438
00:21:13,001 --> 00:21:13,834
happen.
So I think we have to be a little too 

439
00:21:14,591 --> 00:21:16,330
careful and I hear the strict 
conservatives.

440
00:21:16,331 --> 00:21:17,164
Well,
it's all of this is because the family 

441
00:21:19,030 --> 00:21:21,250
model has degraded as well.
Historically,

442
00:21:21,251 --> 00:21:24,340
I'm not so sure we as a people in 
particular ever had that.

443
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:26,290
That's not real.
Yeah.

444
00:21:26,291 --> 00:21:27,124
I was mentioning to you before it also 
that I just went to george washington's 

445
00:21:29,650 --> 00:21:30,483
estate and you can go to the slave 
quarters and they do a daily memorial 

446
00:21:32,931 --> 00:21:34,810
and all that,
and they talk about the men living here.

447
00:21:34,900 --> 00:21:37,780
They're living here.
They sometimes only got it interacts for

448
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:40,180
for minutes in a day and all sorts of 
stuff.

449
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:41,110
Yeah,
so you know,

450
00:21:41,111 --> 00:21:46,111
sometimes when we have to help people 
revisit history sometimes they're like,

451
00:21:46,301 --> 00:21:47,200
oh,
it was great.

452
00:21:47,201 --> 00:21:49,510
Back in the day.
Not exactly.

453
00:21:49,940 --> 00:21:51,550
SpeakiNg of history,
I wasn't planning on going here,

454
00:21:51,551 --> 00:21:52,900
but as long as we're talking about this 
list,

455
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:55,540
what do you make of all the monuments 
stuff happening right now?

456
00:21:55,541 --> 00:21:56,374
Because I just read one this week that 
at at christ church and I think it's in 

457
00:21:59,411 --> 00:22:00,244
alexandria.
They're taking down george the minute I 

458
00:22:02,921 --> 00:22:03,754
think it's just a plaque actually,
and I guess there was also a plaque to 

459
00:22:05,891 --> 00:22:07,750
robert e dot lee that upset some people,
so they said,

460
00:22:07,751 --> 00:22:08,584
all right,
we're going to take down george 

461
00:22:08,801 --> 00:22:10,720
washington's as well,
George Washington,

462
00:22:10,721 --> 00:22:12,340
than there is no doubt he did own 
slaves.

463
00:22:12,341 --> 00:22:14,350
He freed as many as he legally could.

464
00:22:14,350 --> 00:22:15,183
When he died,
not all of them more because some of 

465
00:22:16,841 --> 00:22:17,674
them were technically,
I think owned by martha or for her or 

466
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:22,840
her family or something like that,
but as I said,

467
00:22:22,841 --> 00:22:24,490
they do a great memorial to them.
These people,

468
00:22:24,491 --> 00:22:25,324
we're all complex.
People who were writing law is to free 

469
00:22:27,881 --> 00:22:31,630
people while they own people.
I mean it's a whole freaking thing,

470
00:22:31,900 --> 00:22:32,733
but me personally,
you want my answer firstly because I'm 

471
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:36,400
glad to,
but tell me what do you think?

472
00:22:36,820 --> 00:22:38,800
I don't think you can take these things 
down.

473
00:22:38,801 --> 00:22:40,780
I think you can put a,
a,

474
00:22:40,910 --> 00:22:45,220
a counter monument next to them or a 
plaque that explains more.

475
00:22:45,340 --> 00:22:46,173
Maybe you could convince me that they 
can all be moved to a museum where then 

476
00:22:49,361 --> 00:22:50,830
you are going to learn about the 
history,

477
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:51,873
but I'm very leery that there's just no 
ending here that we're going to take 

478
00:22:54,821 --> 00:22:56,260
down the robert e dot lee stuff.

479
00:22:56,470 --> 00:22:57,810
We're going to take down,
You know,

480
00:22:57,830 --> 00:23:01,210
other confederate stuff,
but he will creep to George Washington.

481
00:23:01,390 --> 00:23:04,600
It will creep to Thomas Jefferson.
I was just at the memorial,

482
00:23:04,601 --> 00:23:07,060
but words that that man wrote about what
freedom is.

483
00:23:07,270 --> 00:23:10,420
That's the stuff we should all care 
about and I just feared that there is no

484
00:23:10,421 --> 00:23:11,254
ending here.
I don't know if that's enough of a 

485
00:23:12,761 --> 00:23:13,594
justification not to take anything down,
but that's really where my position is 

486
00:23:16,901 --> 00:23:18,280
coming from.
That it won't end.

487
00:23:18,580 --> 00:23:20,260
Well,
not surprisingly,

488
00:23:20,261 --> 00:23:22,410
I violently agree with you.
I,

489
00:23:22,420 --> 00:23:23,080
I,
uh,

490
00:23:23,080 --> 00:23:24,560
I would have accepted either.
Oh no,

491
00:23:24,561 --> 00:23:27,490
I know that would've given him,
but frankly,

492
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:28,353
you know,
there are a couple of aha moments for 

493
00:23:29,801 --> 00:23:30,730
me.
First of all,

494
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:34,930
we don't like to acknowledge this,
but black people owned slaves in America

495
00:23:34,931 --> 00:23:37,060
too.
That's real.

496
00:23:37,420 --> 00:23:38,253
I'm the litmus test is if you own slave 
somehow we should erase from history or 

497
00:23:43,781 --> 00:23:46,150
puts you into a museum,
a little box so that only

498
00:23:46,190 --> 00:23:48,920
people who visit museums will learn 
about.

499
00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:52,460
That's why I don't really like that I 
throw it up there because I,

500
00:23:52,461 --> 00:23:55,040
in a q and a that I did at claremont 
mckenna,

501
00:23:55,810 --> 00:23:57,380
a kid asked me and I said that.
He said,

502
00:23:57,381 --> 00:23:58,520
well,
what if we put them in mind as I said?

503
00:23:58,521 --> 00:24:00,770
All right.
We can play with that one a little bit,

504
00:24:01,040 --> 00:24:03,020
but to your point,
if you take this to its,

505
00:24:03,140 --> 00:24:03,973
I think illogical in [inaudible] we 
didn't go through and parse every 

506
00:24:07,521 --> 00:24:11,120
person's history and we find the one 
thing they did that we didn't like,

507
00:24:11,390 --> 00:24:15,380
which by the way at that time,
at that point in the world may have been

508
00:24:15,500 --> 00:24:18,470
totally the norm.
I'm not arguing it was good or bad.

509
00:24:18,471 --> 00:24:19,304
I'm just saying it was the way people 
lived and it was the what was the more 

510
00:24:22,571 --> 00:24:23,360
ready,
the way,

511
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:25,480
whatever of the time I.

512
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:29,330
I struggle with this.
I think you put everything into context.

513
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:32,600
When I ride through and I see a 
confederate statue,

514
00:24:32,601 --> 00:24:33,434
I was laughing.
I was in old town alexandria the other 

515
00:24:34,851 --> 00:24:38,230
day.
I have passed this particular this.

516
00:24:38,430 --> 00:24:39,263
Which one is it?
I was just as robert e dot lee is the 

517
00:24:40,551 --> 00:24:42,680
one that's sitting right in.
It's just passed.

518
00:24:42,681 --> 00:24:44,450
I don't know the street of past king 
street.

519
00:24:44,451 --> 00:24:45,284
I think it is.
There's a statute at this guy on a 

520
00:24:47,771 --> 00:24:48,604
horse.
I've passed out a number of times and 

521
00:24:49,341 --> 00:24:49,700
thought,
well,

522
00:24:49,700 --> 00:24:50,990
that's interesting.
Um,

523
00:24:50,991 --> 00:24:51,824
I've also,
I live in Washington dc on capitol hill 

524
00:24:53,481 --> 00:24:56,570
and there are all sorts of these 
statutes that frankly charles barkley,

525
00:24:56,571 --> 00:25:01,571
who I don't quote very often to my 
impression would it dell,

526
00:25:03,780 --> 00:25:06,470
but he said something which was really 
provocative.

527
00:25:06,500 --> 00:25:07,910
he said,
frankly,

528
00:25:08,270 --> 00:25:12,050
most african american people aren't 
thinking about that damn monument.

529
00:25:12,170 --> 00:25:12,771
I mean,
it's just,

530
00:25:12,771 --> 00:25:15,770
we have real issues facing our 
community.

531
00:25:16,070 --> 00:25:16,903
And the idea that we have now gotten 
preoccupied with these monuments is 

532
00:25:20,631 --> 00:25:24,920
bizarre to me and frankly and more 
disturbing to me is that is divisive.

533
00:25:25,790 --> 00:25:29,420
Anytime you start peeling apart people's
history,

534
00:25:29,750 --> 00:25:32,900
all of this is sort of the history of 
the country,

535
00:25:32,901 --> 00:25:36,160
the good and the bad.
And I think that's the beauty of telling

536
00:25:36,161 --> 00:25:38,000
a story.
And when I talk to students about it,

537
00:25:38,001 --> 00:25:40,650
because I've had this conversation with 
some of our students and I said,

538
00:25:41,030 --> 00:25:42,170
you know,
all of us,

539
00:25:42,210 --> 00:25:43,043
we go back into history even to find out
that your grandparents weren't perfect 

540
00:25:46,101 --> 00:25:47,790
people.
You know,

541
00:25:47,810 --> 00:25:48,643
the grandfather who beat on your 
grandmother who cheated on your 

542
00:25:51,051 --> 00:25:53,000
grandmother.
The grandmother who,

543
00:25:53,001 --> 00:25:54,890
well,
let's say back in the day,

544
00:25:54,891 --> 00:25:57,870
decided not to have a kid.
just had a kid out of wedlock and decide

545
00:25:57,871 --> 00:26:00,440
to give them to an ant and never 
acknowledged and was.

546
00:26:00,950 --> 00:26:01,783
There's so many things we've ball our 
bodies and the notion that somehow 

547
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:09,673
you've literally made this person's life
less important because of a decision 

548
00:26:13,881 --> 00:26:14,660
that happened.
I mean,

549
00:26:14,660 --> 00:26:15,493
all of us are growing on this journey 
called life and I just think we've 

550
00:26:17,781 --> 00:26:22,280
gotten too serious about it and it's 
also frankly divided the country.

551
00:26:22,281 --> 00:26:24,410
A country that is way too divided right 
now.

552
00:26:24,411 --> 00:26:25,370
I mean,
I've never seen.

553
00:26:25,670 --> 00:26:30,350
I think of martin luther king,
a lincoln thurgood marshall.

554
00:26:30,351 --> 00:26:33,230
They have to be like sitting back 
somewhere looking at this hand,

555
00:26:33,290 --> 00:26:35,240
oh my god,
I can't believe.

556
00:26:35,241 --> 00:26:38,180
Once we pulled the rules down,
change the laws,

557
00:26:38,330 --> 00:26:39,163
became a more open and free society.
None of us could have thought that this 

558
00:26:43,291 --> 00:26:45,240
is where we'd end up.
Yeah,

559
00:26:45,241 --> 00:26:47,550
and you know,
the easy answer is to blame it on trump,

560
00:26:47,580 --> 00:26:50,130
but the fact of the matter is this 
started way before.

561
00:26:50,130 --> 00:26:53,310
This has nothing I know so now,
now,

562
00:26:53,311 --> 00:26:54,740
but I'm pretty sure some,
even the.

563
00:26:54,780 --> 00:26:57,400
Even the nfl protests were going on 
under obama horse.

564
00:26:57,840 --> 00:26:59,430
When you talk about the historical 
stuff,

565
00:26:59,850 --> 00:27:01,020
obama,
his first president,

566
00:27:01,500 --> 00:27:03,480
first four years was against gay 
marriage.

567
00:27:05,170 --> 00:27:10,170
now 20 years ago we got to take obama's 
statue or take his library down or don't

568
00:27:10,591 --> 00:27:14,640
even start me on that.
I've got countless examples.

569
00:27:14,810 --> 00:27:16,830
You know,
I was talking to folks at a.

570
00:27:17,210 --> 00:27:20,340
That was a big discussion about public 
schools and you know,

571
00:27:20,610 --> 00:27:22,440
we need to send all of our kids to 
public schools,

572
00:27:22,470 --> 00:27:23,970
synthesize timeout,
timeout,

573
00:27:23,971 --> 00:27:24,804
timeout.
The obama girls were to to go to school 

574
00:27:26,940 --> 00:27:29,440
sidwell.
I know it's not very fast for them,

575
00:27:30,270 --> 00:27:32,130
but then you can't turn around and say,
oh,

576
00:27:32,131 --> 00:27:32,964
public school's a wonderful.
They're great for everyone when they 

577
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:38,640
know the reality is they are good enough
for your children.

578
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:43,140
Those are some of the moments when we 
have to stop and just pause and say,

579
00:27:44,260 --> 00:27:45,960
you know this.
It's gotten crazy.

580
00:27:45,990 --> 00:27:46,681
That's the point.
I mean,

581
00:27:46,681 --> 00:27:47,514
I'm so frustrated with it right now 
because we're picking apart people's 

582
00:27:50,281 --> 00:27:51,114
lives and the reality is none of us 
would want someone to do the same thing 

583
00:27:54,750 --> 00:27:57,240
on an individual level with me.
you want to pick my life apart.

584
00:27:57,241 --> 00:27:59,220
You can come out and say,
I'm a horrible person.

585
00:27:59,580 --> 00:28:00,413
Ignore the fact that I have a beautiful 
seven year old daughter that my parents 

586
00:28:02,521 --> 00:28:04,080
were wonderful,
that I'm a good son a good,

587
00:28:04,410 --> 00:28:07,680
but you want to focus on the one or two 
decisions that perhaps I would have.

588
00:28:07,830 --> 00:28:08,663
I'm frankly,
I would have done them differently if I 

589
00:28:10,231 --> 00:28:12,630
were 48.
I was 18.

590
00:28:13,950 --> 00:28:14,641
So yeah,
it's,

591
00:28:14,641 --> 00:28:15,474
it's,
um,

592
00:28:15,750 --> 00:28:18,330
we're just in an interesting spot and I 
know that's what you're talking about,

593
00:28:18,331 --> 00:28:19,260
but it disturbs me.

594
00:28:19,260 --> 00:28:20,093
It disturbs me in some very significant 
ways that I'm raising a child in this 

595
00:28:24,121 --> 00:28:26,400
world,
in this country in particular.

596
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:28,800
This is not the country I envisioned it 
would be.

597
00:28:28,850 --> 00:28:29,683
Yeah.
Do you think there's any chance that it 

598
00:28:31,531 --> 00:28:32,364
actually is the country,
but it's just the level of noise has 

599
00:28:35,731 --> 00:28:38,100
gotten so out of control.
So when we think about,

600
00:28:38,160 --> 00:28:38,993
you know,
I talk a lot about social media and how 

601
00:28:40,170 --> 00:28:41,003
twitter is affecting everybody and the 
way we will cater news to ourselves and 

602
00:28:43,711 --> 00:28:47,100
all that stuff.
BuT then I took all of august offline.

603
00:28:47,190 --> 00:28:49,020
I shut down.
I was working on my book.

604
00:28:49,021 --> 00:28:52,290
I disappeared for awhile and when I 
spent more time just,

605
00:28:52,380 --> 00:28:55,170
I mean I talked to people for a living,
but outside of this room,

606
00:28:55,171 --> 00:28:56,004
just talking to random people,
I think most people do buy everything 

607
00:28:59,941 --> 00:29:00,774
that you just said there and I don't 
think that people are necessarily as 

608
00:29:05,551 --> 00:29:07,920
hysterical as maybe we feel they are.

609
00:29:07,920 --> 00:29:08,753
Do you think that's possible or is that.
I'm just trying to give a real silver 

610
00:29:10,651 --> 00:29:11,484
lining to this.
I think you're trying to feel better 

611
00:29:12,780 --> 00:29:13,613
because as much as we can,
we can't just put the media over in a 

612
00:29:16,231 --> 00:29:17,610
little box.
Particularly.

613
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:21,180
It used to be traditional media,
but now social media and so when you add

614
00:29:21,181 --> 00:29:22,014
all of that,
it really does influence the narrative 

615
00:29:23,821 --> 00:29:24,654
and it influences what people think it 
means to live in America and and I do 

616
00:29:28,591 --> 00:29:32,220
think we're in a very different place 
now and you're right,

617
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:34,910
every person in the world doesn't know 
what's going on.

618
00:29:34,920 --> 00:29:35,753
Manafort gets charged today.
The vast majority of americans don't 

619
00:29:37,921 --> 00:29:38,754
know or care.
It's people who watch the news and who 

620
00:29:40,561 --> 00:29:42,050
read and who think about this,
who,

621
00:29:42,140 --> 00:29:43,840
and you know,
where it matters.

622
00:29:43,841 --> 00:29:46,510
The vast majority of americans are like,
I'm trying to keep the lights on,

623
00:29:46,511 --> 00:29:47,344
I want to put my kid in school and I 
want a decent life and retire with some 

624
00:29:50,170 --> 00:29:52,450
decent savings in a bank that's more 
practical.

625
00:29:52,450 --> 00:29:55,180
So I think you're right.
But the influencers,

626
00:29:55,181 --> 00:29:57,580
people like me and you,
um,

627
00:29:57,820 --> 00:29:58,653
maybe not like the two of us is the more
liberal media has just put it out there 

628
00:30:03,911 --> 00:30:04,744
so far.
Progressively they're really crafting 

629
00:30:07,271 --> 00:30:09,040
the narrative and the message and it's,
it's,

630
00:30:09,080 --> 00:30:09,913
it's something that we have to pause.
Do you find yourself with a political 

631
00:30:12,971 --> 00:30:16,000
home?
Because obviously I'm in a lockstep with

632
00:30:16,001 --> 00:30:16,834
so much of the things that you're so 
many of the things that you're talking 

633
00:30:18,581 --> 00:30:19,780
about.
When I heard you give that speech,

634
00:30:19,781 --> 00:30:20,614
I was like,
yeah,

635
00:30:20,620 --> 00:30:21,400
yeah,
yeah.

636
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:22,600
Well,
I mean 20 times I was like,

637
00:30:22,601 --> 00:30:23,321
yeah,
yeah,

638
00:30:23,321 --> 00:30:24,041
yeah.
Okay.

639
00:30:24,041 --> 00:30:24,874
Yeah,
yeah.

640
00:30:24,940 --> 00:30:26,440
Um,
do you,

641
00:30:26,620 --> 00:30:27,940
I mean,
do you consider yourself,

642
00:30:27,941 --> 00:30:29,860
are you in a party or totally 
independent?

643
00:30:30,130 --> 00:30:33,820
So or as when I was in North Carolina,
it was called unaffiliated.

644
00:30:34,710 --> 00:30:35,543
That was the phrase you wanted an 
independent because there were 

645
00:30:37,031 --> 00:30:37,590
independent.

646
00:30:37,590 --> 00:30:38,830
So that was the,
a third party.

647
00:30:38,831 --> 00:30:39,664
So it's unaffiliate.
I was a democrat for years and actually 

648
00:30:42,490 --> 00:30:46,900
quite as it's kept up was a big part of 
hillary clinton's 2008 campaign,

649
00:30:47,210 --> 00:30:49,360
a raised tons of money.
Had her in my home.

650
00:30:49,361 --> 00:30:52,300
Fundraisers had erskine bowles and his 
wife.

651
00:30:52,301 --> 00:30:55,090
I mean I was like really,
really into that world.

652
00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:56,780
I did not see that in the research.
Yeah.

653
00:30:56,781 --> 00:30:57,614
Yeah.
So I'm literally hosted in my home in 

654
00:30:59,831 --> 00:31:03,310
North Carolina and did a lot and then 
fast forward,

655
00:31:03,311 --> 00:31:06,340
I've become this last election,
frankly less enamored.

656
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:07,233
So I was not involved in that campaign.
I also wasn't a involved in donald 

657
00:31:11,531 --> 00:31:12,364
trump's campaign.
I just have decided that I'm going to 

658
00:31:14,411 --> 00:31:17,620
have to figure out where I fit.
And right now it's just,

659
00:31:17,621 --> 00:31:19,900
I'd like to say I'm an american,
I'm a patriot.

660
00:31:20,020 --> 00:31:20,853
I'm trying to figure out on balance 
which individual is looking out for the 

661
00:31:25,901 --> 00:31:27,670
best interest of America.

662
00:31:27,970 --> 00:31:30,340
And that's a very,
it's a lonely place sometimes.

663
00:31:30,360 --> 00:31:32,020
It's because you know,
we're in this bike,

664
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:33,233
but you know you are a democrat or a 
republican and some call themselves 

665
00:31:37,151 --> 00:31:37,984
independents,
but the reality is they lean left or 

666
00:31:39,491 --> 00:31:41,290
right.
I'm sort of in the middle.

667
00:31:41,320 --> 00:31:44,980
They were things that I think I would 
take positions that I take that are more

668
00:31:44,981 --> 00:31:45,814
conservatively aligned and the near 
times when it's more or less 

669
00:31:49,780 --> 00:31:51,760
conservatively or more liberally 
aligned,

670
00:31:52,120 --> 00:31:55,180
but I don't think you can just fall into
a box.

671
00:31:55,181 --> 00:31:57,010
I really don't.
I think that's the problem.

672
00:31:57,190 --> 00:31:59,680
Frankly.
There are some issues that I really take

673
00:31:59,681 --> 00:32:01,450
a strong position on it.
I mean we were just,

674
00:32:01,451 --> 00:32:02,900
oh,
this is just the other day,

675
00:32:02,940 --> 00:32:06,070
and we'll talk about something.
I was at the advancing justice seminar.

676
00:32:06,071 --> 00:32:06,904
It's advanced justice summit,
which is hosted by the Charles Koch 

677
00:32:09,701 --> 00:32:10,534
foundation,
big discussion around reducing the 

678
00:32:13,361 --> 00:32:18,310
number of incarcerated americans and so 
someone throughout by 20 slash 20,

679
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:21,340
we want to reduce the number of people 
incarcerated by 50 percent.

680
00:32:22,780 --> 00:32:24,190
And I paused and I said,
well,

681
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:25,473
that's dumb a suppose 30 percent of 
those people really should be 

682
00:32:29,291 --> 00:32:31,660
incarcerated.
Suppose they're not.

683
00:32:31,661 --> 00:32:32,494
They should.
They absolutely cannot be put back on 

684
00:32:34,511 --> 00:32:35,344
the streets.
You're telling me you're thinking 

685
00:32:36,041 --> 00:32:40,560
through just someone yells out of your 
thinking and I'm thinking it through and

686
00:32:41,300 --> 00:32:42,133
tell you why,
because it bothered me because here's 

687
00:32:43,431 --> 00:32:44,264
the deal.
I grew up in one of those fragile 

688
00:32:45,171 --> 00:32:46,004
communities.
I grew up and I shared this with the 

689
00:32:47,511 --> 00:32:48,081
group.
I said,

690
00:32:48,081 --> 00:32:50,210
I grew up in the area and my 
grandmother,

691
00:32:50,211 --> 00:32:53,300
I'll never forget this.
I'll never forget riding up high school.

692
00:32:53,960 --> 00:32:55,790
People would run up to our windows.
She,

693
00:32:55,810 --> 00:32:56,643
you know,
60 plus year old grandmother and me and 

694
00:32:58,521 --> 00:33:03,521
an rotc uniform going to highschool drug
dealers run up to our windows.

695
00:33:03,651 --> 00:33:06,290
Prostitutes are standing on the corner 
in morning.

696
00:33:06,291 --> 00:33:07,730
This is 7:30,
8:00

697
00:33:07,731 --> 00:33:09,370
in the morning next to a school.

698
00:33:09,890 --> 00:33:11,780
Okay,
but this was the community.

699
00:33:11,990 --> 00:33:13,910
My grandmother one day,
I'll never forget it,

700
00:33:14,120 --> 00:33:17,240
she said they wouldn't allow this in 
white town.

701
00:33:18,440 --> 00:33:20,300
They would never put up with this and 
white down.

702
00:33:20,510 --> 00:33:22,580
She was so bothered,
so she became committed.

703
00:33:22,760 --> 00:33:23,593
She called demanded police.
She demanded that you remove these 

704
00:33:25,971 --> 00:33:26,804
people from our community and so fast 
forward you just want to release them 

705
00:33:30,981 --> 00:33:31,814
all back to our community,
and I said this to one of the attendees 

706
00:33:34,650 --> 00:33:36,110
said,
here's the problem.

707
00:33:36,111 --> 00:33:36,944
That sounds great and it's great for you
because they're not coming back to your 

708
00:33:39,471 --> 00:33:40,304
community.
That's that's why this isn't your 

709
00:33:41,931 --> 00:33:42,764
problem.
If you release 50 percent of these 

710
00:33:43,851 --> 00:33:44,840
people,
where do you think they're coming?

711
00:33:44,841 --> 00:33:45,674
They're not coming into suburbia.
They're going to show back up in the 

712
00:33:47,271 --> 00:33:51,050
communities and continue terrorizing and
negatively impacting the community.

713
00:33:51,051 --> 00:33:53,540
So on that plant,
I tell that story to say,

714
00:33:53,870 --> 00:33:54,440
you know,
listen,

715
00:33:54,440 --> 00:33:56,190
I am passionate about and I am bob.

716
00:33:56,210 --> 00:33:57,043
I appreciate well intended people 
thinking that just releasing half the 

717
00:34:00,471 --> 00:34:03,290
people who are currently incarcerated 
into our communities as a good thing,

718
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:06,320
but they don't think about the impact of
that.

719
00:34:06,530 --> 00:34:10,940
When my kid can't go out and play in the
streets for being shot,

720
00:34:10,970 --> 00:34:11,803
my kid can't.
My daughter has to walk past these 

721
00:34:13,671 --> 00:34:14,504
scantily clad women who were selling 
themselves and she begins to think 

722
00:34:17,180 --> 00:34:19,430
that's normal.
That's not the world,

723
00:34:19,431 --> 00:34:22,070
and you may call that a nonviolent 
opened her,

724
00:34:22,310 --> 00:34:23,143
but it's not nonviolent.
It's actually more violent because it's 

725
00:34:25,371 --> 00:34:27,680
working into the psyche.
These young people,

726
00:34:27,900 --> 00:34:28,733
uh,
there's so much there because you could 

727
00:34:29,631 --> 00:34:30,890
also look at that and go,
well,

728
00:34:30,920 --> 00:34:31,753
a certain amount of those people that 
are in there for drug offenses not 

729
00:34:33,531 --> 00:34:34,700
selling right.
And,

730
00:34:34,701 --> 00:34:36,890
and if they had had better 
representation where more money,

731
00:34:36,891 --> 00:34:41,630
they would have never been in jail in 
the first place and either parents or so

732
00:34:41,631 --> 00:34:43,100
you can't just blame the government.

733
00:34:43,100 --> 00:34:43,933
So that's the thing faster.
We want to get to 20 and blame the 

734
00:34:46,611 --> 00:34:47,444
system for not giving them good lawyers 
and the system for incarcerating them 

735
00:34:50,301 --> 00:34:51,134
too long and all of that.
And you forget that a lot of that stuff 

736
00:34:53,541 --> 00:34:54,374
started a lot earlier in their lives.
Now you now you took her back to the 

737
00:34:58,720 --> 00:35:00,140
conservative point.
That's right.

738
00:35:00,290 --> 00:35:01,123
It's not that scared because by the way,
my only point is it doesn't have to be 

739
00:35:03,081 --> 00:35:04,880
mom or dad.
It has to be someone.

740
00:35:04,881 --> 00:35:09,230
It could be a school teacher that helped
infuse morals and the sense of right and

741
00:35:09,231 --> 00:35:11,630
wrong into that kit,
but we've got to go back.

742
00:35:11,631 --> 00:35:13,040
We can't just wake up and say,
okay,

743
00:35:13,041 --> 00:35:15,740
now you've got a 19 year old who has a 
long criminal history.

744
00:35:15,741 --> 00:35:16,574
No regard for anyone or anything and say
we just think he or she should not be 

745
00:35:21,111 --> 00:35:21,944
incarcerated.

746
00:35:22,820 --> 00:35:24,200
Okay.
Then pray,

747
00:35:24,201 --> 00:35:26,630
tell what are you going to do about 
that?

748
00:35:26,990 --> 00:35:29,600
Do you ever get an answer to that?
If you let these people out,

749
00:35:29,601 --> 00:35:31,010
I get that.
I'm totally with you.

750
00:35:31,011 --> 00:35:33,220
Okay.
Came from a bad place.

751
00:35:33,240 --> 00:35:36,860
Didn't have the proper support 
potentially in jail for doing drugs,

752
00:35:36,861 --> 00:35:38,760
not even selling them,
so the idea is,

753
00:35:38,761 --> 00:35:40,350
okay,
you want to get this person out of jail.

754
00:35:40,351 --> 00:35:42,420
Even if even if it's just an economic 
thing,

755
00:35:42,421 --> 00:35:44,510
you don't want to have the system 
spending money on it.

756
00:35:44,511 --> 00:35:45,690
Right,
but now you put them out there,

757
00:35:45,691 --> 00:35:46,524
you still have some responsibility.
I think that the system or whatever you 

758
00:35:49,921 --> 00:35:50,754
wanna call it,
has some responsibility to make sure 

759
00:35:51,721 --> 00:35:52,554
that now you just don't toss this back 
into the mix of what got them there in 

760
00:35:56,131 --> 00:35:59,640
the first place and how do you fix that?
That is the big question.

761
00:35:59,641 --> 00:36:04,641
I mean the easy answer is released it 
and then what I would say.

762
00:36:04,920 --> 00:36:05,753
And then what,
and the thing that bothers me is that 

763
00:36:09,001 --> 00:36:11,850
many of the people who advocate for this
release release,

764
00:36:11,851 --> 00:36:15,240
release don't have to answer the 
question what?

765
00:36:15,241 --> 00:36:16,074
Because they have,
they live in neighborhoods with gate 

766
00:36:17,731 --> 00:36:20,130
gated neighborhoods with a lot of police
protection,

767
00:36:20,370 --> 00:36:22,830
etc.
So they're not impacted by,

768
00:36:22,850 --> 00:36:23,683
they just want to,
once you get them out and we see this 

769
00:36:25,381 --> 00:36:28,740
listen and unfortunately with 
individuals who suffer with mental,

770
00:36:29,010 --> 00:36:31,130
a mental illness,
so you,

771
00:36:31,170 --> 00:36:34,460
you want them out and then what,
what,

772
00:36:34,570 --> 00:36:38,280
what are you going to do now?
And that's someone else's problem.

773
00:36:38,310 --> 00:36:39,143
And the system as you call it,
the non system hasn't answered that 

774
00:36:42,241 --> 00:36:43,074
question.

775
00:36:47,900 --> 00:36:48,733
All right.
Let's shift a little bit to some 

776
00:36:49,891 --> 00:36:50,724
specific issues because I think we've 
done a nice little broad job to start 

777
00:36:53,821 --> 00:36:54,654
here.
Uh,

778
00:36:54,780 --> 00:36:55,613
you mentioned to me briefly something 
about daca that I thought was really 

779
00:36:57,391 --> 00:36:58,710
interesting,
how the black community,

780
00:36:58,930 --> 00:37:01,040
you sort of split on this.
Yeah,

781
00:37:01,041 --> 00:37:01,861
yeah.
You know,

782
00:37:01,861 --> 00:37:04,530
daca is on iTs surface.
It's an easy,

783
00:37:04,590 --> 00:37:06,840
it should have been easy,
but what I've come talking about,

784
00:37:06,841 --> 00:37:07,674
the complexity of it and the nuances.
So increasingly our students on hbcu 

785
00:37:12,751 --> 00:37:13,381
campuses,
uh,

786
00:37:13,381 --> 00:37:16,380
raising,
they have real beef with this as the way

787
00:37:16,381 --> 00:37:19,290
they described it.
So one of the students put it in it,

788
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:21,960
it made me pause because I was like,
that's an easy one.

789
00:37:21,961 --> 00:37:23,460
You're noT going to send 12 million 
people home.

790
00:37:23,461 --> 00:37:25,410
These kids were brought here by their 
parents.

791
00:37:25,430 --> 00:37:26,263
Didn't have a choice.
If I tell my daughter we're going 

792
00:37:27,241 --> 00:37:28,074
somewhere,
she's gone.

793
00:37:28,150 --> 00:37:29,880
Right?
So I get it.

794
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:30,833
Yeah.
And then one of the young women put it 

795
00:37:32,311 --> 00:37:33,144
best.
She said,

796
00:37:33,240 --> 00:37:35,550
you know,
think about the chicago.

797
00:37:35,590 --> 00:37:39,070
She said,
the irony of this is that they're very,

798
00:37:39,100 --> 00:37:43,090
the America is all rallying around 
providing not only a,

799
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:45,480
the ability for these students to enroll
in school,

800
00:37:45,481 --> 00:37:48,030
but oftentimes full scholarships for 
these students.

801
00:37:48,060 --> 00:37:50,310
The daca students,
while she said,

802
00:37:50,311 --> 00:37:53,670
and here I am,
the legal descendant of slaves,

803
00:37:53,671 --> 00:37:54,504
we were forced to come here and I have 
to figure out how to pay for my 

804
00:37:56,701 --> 00:37:59,730
education,
and so there's this tension,

805
00:37:59,780 --> 00:38:02,520
there's real tension and they have to 
whisper it.

806
00:38:02,521 --> 00:38:03,301
So I asked her,
I said,

807
00:38:03,301 --> 00:38:04,134
well,
why don't you just talk about that in 

808
00:38:06,181 --> 00:38:07,200
class?
And she said,

809
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:08,640
oh,
I will be killed.

810
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:11,400
that you can't talk about that in class.
She said,

811
00:38:11,401 --> 00:38:12,234
but there's an underground sort of 
conversation about that doesn't seem 

812
00:38:15,780 --> 00:38:16,613
fair.
If America has enough money to provide 

813
00:38:19,231 --> 00:38:22,140
additional scholarship assistance to 
students,

814
00:38:22,141 --> 00:38:22,974
then shouldn't you take care of people 
like us who were brought here are 

815
00:38:26,430 --> 00:38:29,220
parents who were brought here and we 
truly are.

816
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:31,230
And so I was like,
wow,

817
00:38:31,260 --> 00:38:33,000
that's really.
It was a really.

818
00:38:33,660 --> 00:38:35,920
I hadn't thought about it.
It made me pause.

819
00:38:36,100 --> 00:38:36,933
there is also a recent article,
I think it's the chicago times where a 

820
00:38:39,791 --> 00:38:40,624
guy wrote an editorial about rahm 
emanuel wants to spend one or 

821
00:38:43,391 --> 00:38:44,224
$2,000,000,
so I'm providing ids for undocumented 

822
00:38:47,410 --> 00:38:51,850
immigrants and the black alderman had a 
melt down.

823
00:38:51,880 --> 00:38:52,713
I mean literally it's quoted all over 
the papers saying thIs is absurd and 

824
00:38:55,691 --> 00:38:58,110
enough's enough.
We have americans here,

825
00:38:58,550 --> 00:39:03,010
americans in chicago who need x,
y and z and instead you want to go spend

826
00:39:03,011 --> 00:39:04,450
a bit.
So there's a tension.

827
00:39:04,490 --> 00:39:07,540
Americans that are really inflection 
point that's just not black and white or

828
00:39:07,541 --> 00:39:08,374
conservative and liberal.
There's tension now amongst people of 

829
00:39:11,141 --> 00:39:12,160
color.
Yeah.

830
00:39:12,161 --> 00:39:12,994
And it seems to me that obviously that 
conversation is good and it's nice to 

831
00:39:16,121 --> 00:39:16,954
hear that a student said something to 
you that made you reevaluate because 

832
00:39:19,361 --> 00:39:21,580
that shows you practice what you preach 
obviously.

833
00:39:22,170 --> 00:39:24,370
Um,
is there,

834
00:39:24,600 --> 00:39:26,240
is there,
who's the leaDer right now?

835
00:39:26,240 --> 00:39:26,840
If I,
I,

836
00:39:26,840 --> 00:39:28,780
you know,
I know you probably get this one all the

837
00:39:28,781 --> 00:39:30,910
time and I don't even like the question 
in a certain way,

838
00:39:31,240 --> 00:39:35,260
but,
but who should black America,

839
00:39:35,560 --> 00:39:36,530
whatever that is.
It's so,

840
00:39:36,531 --> 00:39:40,600
it's so stupid talking about that stuff.
But like who should be in your opinion,

841
00:39:40,601 --> 00:39:43,840
should the community be turning to,
to make some sense of this?

842
00:39:43,841 --> 00:39:44,674
Because there's the usual cast of 
characters and we can name all the ones 

843
00:39:46,961 --> 00:39:50,110
that you don't like that or on msnbc 
everyday and I don't like him either,

844
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:54,100
so let's just forget those.
Some people that we should be looking at

845
00:39:54,340 --> 00:39:56,110
that and I don't even mean just black 
America,

846
00:39:56,111 --> 00:39:59,020
but no for people that really care about
freedom.

847
00:39:59,110 --> 00:40:00,760
So you make the good point.
Um,

848
00:40:01,420 --> 00:40:03,330
I don't even know.
America generally,

849
00:40:03,350 --> 00:40:06,070
you know,
that we can identify someone who is sane

850
00:40:06,071 --> 00:40:08,380
and rational and logical and thoughtful.

851
00:40:09,060 --> 00:40:11,320
But in the african american community,
you've nailed it.

852
00:40:11,590 --> 00:40:12,423
I,
we had a generation of leaders and they 

853
00:40:13,961 --> 00:40:16,810
were right for that era and what was 
going on.

854
00:40:17,290 --> 00:40:18,970
Fast forward 20,
30 years,

855
00:40:18,971 --> 00:40:21,520
I'm not sure.
And I've actually sat with a group of my

856
00:40:21,521 --> 00:40:22,480
counterpart,
you know,

857
00:40:22,630 --> 00:40:25,630
forties successful and said,
who's the leader?

858
00:40:25,660 --> 00:40:26,493
Who's the voice,
what voice captures what's happening in 

859
00:40:29,051 --> 00:40:30,310
african american community.
Now,

860
00:40:30,311 --> 00:40:32,460
to be fair,
it's not monolithic.

861
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:33,640
African americans,
You know,

862
00:40:33,641 --> 00:40:36,310
like any other guy.
That's why I don't like it,

863
00:40:36,580 --> 00:40:39,910
but it was never modeled that they put.
We had leaders.

864
00:40:39,970 --> 00:40:42,700
Martin luther king was a leader,
although you know,

865
00:40:42,730 --> 00:40:44,560
he,
he wasn't from industry,

866
00:40:44,561 --> 00:40:45,371
he didn't,
you know,

867
00:40:45,371 --> 00:40:48,310
so,
but still he represented just,

868
00:40:48,311 --> 00:40:51,880
he caught and captured the voice of the 
community.

869
00:40:52,360 --> 00:40:54,790
I have to honestly say,
and it's something that bothers me.

870
00:40:55,060 --> 00:40:55,893
I don't know who that person is and,
and I'm not so sure that if you asked 

871
00:40:59,471 --> 00:41:02,170
him lack people,
nine of them would say,

872
00:41:02,230 --> 00:41:03,610
I'm not sure who that leader is.

873
00:41:03,670 --> 00:41:05,470
Yeah.
And it's so complex because you remember

874
00:41:05,471 --> 00:41:06,304
a couple of years ago when oprah said 
the thing about how well we just need 

875
00:41:09,191 --> 00:41:12,080
these old racists to die and she was 
referencing,

876
00:41:12,190 --> 00:41:13,023
she was referencing some people's 
grandmothers and grandfathers and I 

877
00:41:14,981 --> 00:41:17,630
remember thinking,
and I have no beef with open,

878
00:41:18,470 --> 00:41:21,700
but I remember hearing that and thinking
this is so dangerous.

879
00:41:21,701 --> 00:41:24,940
It gets back to what we were talking 
about earlier about how You just live in

880
00:41:24,941 --> 00:41:25,774
your times and all that.
Like no one wants to look at their 

881
00:41:27,461 --> 00:41:29,920
grandparents who live grew up in a 
different time of thing.

882
00:41:30,090 --> 00:41:33,170
I had to wait until you just drop dead 
so you can't vote anymore with it.

883
00:41:33,540 --> 00:41:34,060
And it

884
00:41:34,060 --> 00:41:35,360
makes me think,
you know,

885
00:41:35,361 --> 00:41:38,810
I had my grandmother taught school for 
46 years in broward county,

886
00:41:38,811 --> 00:41:41,070
Florida.
And um,

887
00:41:41,360 --> 00:41:45,410
I remember she said something to me now 
and I think the world of my grandmother,

888
00:41:45,411 --> 00:41:46,820
she's still alive,
93 years old,

889
00:41:46,830 --> 00:41:48,080
94.
It just had a birthdaY.

890
00:41:48,440 --> 00:41:49,273
And um,
I remember going down to the university 

891
00:41:51,291 --> 00:41:56,291
of miami and I came home and I said,
I think I've met someone and it was,

892
00:41:57,710 --> 00:42:02,090
she assumed it was a white woman because
I'm at a majority institution,

893
00:42:02,091 --> 00:42:03,020
you know,
lily white,

894
00:42:03,021 --> 00:42:05,060
university of miami.
And she said,

895
00:42:05,270 --> 00:42:07,620
son,
I'd rather you bring a man home that,

896
00:42:07,650 --> 00:42:08,483
wow,
now this is someone who I adore and I 

897
00:42:13,161 --> 00:42:16,280
think the world of her.
But I had to stop and pause.

898
00:42:16,281 --> 00:42:17,114
It stuck me.
I remember that I'd rather you bring a 

899
00:42:18,060 --> 00:42:23,060
manhole than a white woman.
And I had to realize that a lot of folks

900
00:42:23,301 --> 00:42:28,070
hold these racial things and they are 
products of their era like,

901
00:42:28,071 --> 00:42:28,640
right.

902
00:42:28,640 --> 00:42:30,140
so when I see,
you know,

903
00:42:30,141 --> 00:42:34,370
an older 90 year old lady or old white 
guy who has an harbor,

904
00:42:34,371 --> 00:42:37,240
some racial animus,
I wasn't around then,

905
00:42:37,241 --> 00:42:39,860
I can't really put that in context.
I'm not justifying it,

906
00:42:39,861 --> 00:42:40,694
I'm not saying it's right or wrong,
but what I am saying to your earlier 

907
00:42:42,921 --> 00:42:43,754
point is I love my grandmother and if 
you tried to attack my grandmother 

908
00:42:47,361 --> 00:42:52,361
because she espoused that worldview,
I would attack you because I look at the

909
00:42:52,371 --> 00:42:56,480
totality of her contributions to this 
country and her,

910
00:42:56,510 --> 00:42:57,343
her racist tendencies.
I want a product of the era that she 

911
00:43:00,591 --> 00:43:02,660
grew up in,
but they are also a very,

912
00:43:02,661 --> 00:43:05,030
very small part of the full woman that I
know.

913
00:43:05,080 --> 00:43:06,560
Yes.
And that's the key part.

914
00:43:06,561 --> 00:43:09,110
Everyone wants to define everything you 
said earlier.

915
00:43:09,290 --> 00:43:12,110
You could figure out some thing that you
did when you were 18.

916
00:43:12,180 --> 00:43:14,580
something that I did when I was 26 and 
go man,

917
00:43:14,750 --> 00:43:16,990
affordances that matter.

918
00:43:17,060 --> 00:43:17,781
Right?
Exactly.

919
00:43:17,781 --> 00:43:21,410
But that's the point that we're just 
pieces of all of this.

920
00:43:21,490 --> 00:43:22,580
Uh,
it's easy to.

921
00:43:22,581 --> 00:43:23,690
And that's,
that's a problem.

922
00:43:23,691 --> 00:43:27,950
we just want to collapse on.
The one thing that someone did that,

923
00:43:27,980 --> 00:43:32,730
by the way unpopular now,
what do you think a martin luther king,

924
00:43:32,731 --> 00:43:36,130
we would think about the identity 
politics stuff it.

925
00:43:36,150 --> 00:43:38,690
It's I,
I would like to think,

926
00:43:38,810 --> 00:43:39,643
and by the way I say that because you 
read so many versions of what martin 

927
00:43:43,130 --> 00:43:43,963
fought.
I've heard people say he was a 

928
00:43:44,511 --> 00:43:46,520
republican.
Then I've heard people help he,

929
00:43:46,540 --> 00:43:47,660
he's a womanizer.
He said this,

930
00:43:47,661 --> 00:43:48,494
you just don't know.
I think you can make an interesting 

931
00:43:50,031 --> 00:43:53,110
argument that he was a conservative and 
endow a.

932
00:43:53,390 --> 00:43:55,370
He doesn't want his children to be 
judged by the color of their skin.

933
00:43:55,371 --> 00:43:56,204
That actually sounds a little more like 
a conservative idea because that's not 

934
00:43:58,881 --> 00:44:00,350
an identity politics idea yet.

935
00:44:00,350 --> 00:44:03,800
Hit a lot of his economic stuff was 
veering more towards socialism in a way,

936
00:44:03,801 --> 00:44:07,340
so I think you can argue both,
but I think on balance,

937
00:44:07,460 --> 00:44:11,870
I think he would.
I believe that he would be looking.

938
00:44:11,871 --> 00:44:14,240
He's looking down and saying,
you know,

939
00:44:14,600 --> 00:44:18,560
no system is perfect.
No set of rules is perfect,

940
00:44:18,830 --> 00:44:19,663
but this is a lot better people today 
than it was what we inherited back then 

941
00:44:25,820 --> 00:44:26,653
is far worse than what you have today,
so why don't we look at the progress 

942
00:44:29,601 --> 00:44:31,560
that was made and figure out how we 
build on it.

943
00:44:31,800 --> 00:44:35,490
I'd like to think that because his 
nature was one of working together,

944
00:44:35,491 --> 00:44:38,580
finding commonality and peaceful 
protests,

945
00:44:39,120 --> 00:44:39,953
you know,
people now you know not allowing people 

946
00:44:41,971 --> 00:44:45,780
to talk when you disagree with them,
literally shouting them down.

947
00:44:46,110 --> 00:44:48,600
Think about that era when martin luther 
king,

948
00:44:48,640 --> 00:44:50,490
we were the minority.
There were clearly,

949
00:44:50,550 --> 00:44:51,383
I mean really in the minority,
literally they could have silenced him 

950
00:44:55,200 --> 00:45:00,200
by yelling and shouting him down and 
somehow the country allow that voice to,

951
00:45:01,450 --> 00:45:03,960
to and people embraced it because they 
listened to it.

952
00:45:04,110 --> 00:45:07,350
Even people who were probably not 
inclined to agree with him,

953
00:45:07,650 --> 00:45:09,180
you know,
for that that time,

954
00:45:09,570 --> 00:45:10,800
but by listening,
they said,

955
00:45:10,830 --> 00:45:12,900
oh,
maybe he's done to something,

956
00:45:12,901 --> 00:45:15,780
and it really piqued their heart.
It got to the heart and said,

957
00:45:15,781 --> 00:45:16,614
you know what?
This is probably not the right way to 

958
00:45:18,361 --> 00:45:22,080
think about my fellow americans.
It was because they listened,

959
00:45:22,110 --> 00:45:24,990
but if you aren't even being,
if you can't hear,

960
00:45:24,991 --> 00:45:28,110
if you're unwilling to listen.
Martin has to be sad right now.

961
00:45:28,570 --> 00:45:30,150
Yeah.
I was just,

962
00:45:30,151 --> 00:45:30,984
at the moment I was telling me how is 
this an dc going all these things and 

963
00:45:33,781 --> 00:45:34,614
that's what I felt.
I just felt things had gotten so much 

964
00:45:37,111 --> 00:45:38,990
better for everybody.
It doesn't matter.

965
00:45:39,160 --> 00:45:39,993
There isn't racism.
It doesn't mean some people don't like 

966
00:45:41,641 --> 00:45:45,120
gay people or any of those things,
but we are.

967
00:45:45,121 --> 00:45:49,230
Laws basically are fair and it's like 
where else are they doing it better?

968
00:45:49,290 --> 00:45:51,900
That's right.
Are you looking to move somewhere?

969
00:45:52,020 --> 00:45:52,853
I mean,
the same thing right after even after 

970
00:45:54,241 --> 00:45:55,170
the trump election,
you know,

971
00:45:55,171 --> 00:45:56,880
I remembered all of those folks.
If he is elected,

972
00:45:56,881 --> 00:45:58,810
I'm leaving the country.
No,

973
00:45:59,810 --> 00:46:03,150
I'm still here and I check every day.
She's still here.

974
00:46:03,151 --> 00:46:03,984
Right?
All of these folks with rosie and the 

975
00:46:05,041 --> 00:46:07,140
name of the group who all thought they 
were gonna leave the country.

976
00:46:07,141 --> 00:46:08,310
I'm like,
you're not going anywhere.

977
00:46:08,311 --> 00:46:09,144
Shut up.

978
00:46:09,940 --> 00:46:12,180
I don't want to go too far down the 
trump thing unless you want to go there,

979
00:46:12,760 --> 00:46:15,510
but do you think that whatever's 
happening with him right now,

980
00:46:15,511 --> 00:46:17,460
and as you said,
as we're taping this today,

981
00:46:17,850 --> 00:46:18,683
manafort was indicted by the fbi.
It sounds like it's not even directly 

982
00:46:22,681 --> 00:46:23,514
about the trump campaign,
that it's about some Ukraine stuff 

983
00:46:25,771 --> 00:46:26,340
before,
but,

984
00:46:26,340 --> 00:46:29,580
but we'll see where all that plays out.
But as a general rule,

985
00:46:30,180 --> 00:46:32,040
what do you make of what's happened?
Because to me,

986
00:46:32,041 --> 00:46:35,160
what I keep trying to say is if you just
let go of the tweets for a minute,

987
00:46:35,350 --> 00:46:36,183
you let go over the media hysteria.
Basically nothing bad has happened 

988
00:46:40,950 --> 00:46:41,790
basically.

989
00:46:43,020 --> 00:46:44,520
Well,
two things.

990
00:46:44,521 --> 00:46:45,354
First of all,
y'all.

991
00:46:45,470 --> 00:46:46,740
I know it's hard to get rid of the.
No,

992
00:46:46,741 --> 00:46:48,050
no.
You've only had eight months of it,

993
00:46:48,150 --> 00:46:50,820
so yeah,
nothing bad could really happen at eight

994
00:46:50,821 --> 00:46:51,654
months.
Anyway.

995
00:46:51,720 --> 00:46:54,120
This is a republic that has been around 
for a very long time.

996
00:46:54,121 --> 00:46:56,130
It's going to be around a long time 
after him.

997
00:46:56,160 --> 00:46:56,993
So that's the beginning.
The other thing is it goes back to this 

998
00:46:59,311 --> 00:47:01,120
media thing.
If You are,

999
00:47:02,090 --> 00:47:05,640
if you continually.
There's a barrage of information.

1000
00:47:05,641 --> 00:47:07,770
It says everything this person does is 
bad.

1001
00:47:07,771 --> 00:47:09,790
At some point you believe it.
Right,

1002
00:47:09,990 --> 00:47:13,410
and I think that's a part of it.
He's trying to figure it out.

1003
00:47:13,950 --> 00:47:16,010
Could he stay off the tweet a little 
bit?

1004
00:47:16,110 --> 00:47:17,100
Twitter off?
Yes.

1005
00:47:17,610 --> 00:47:19,260
Could he be a little bit more 
presidential?

1006
00:47:19,261 --> 00:47:21,150
Hell,
he admitted it this weekend when he said

1007
00:47:21,180 --> 00:47:22,013
that,
but I'm about to say about Michael 

1008
00:47:23,110 --> 00:47:26,430
Morton is totally non presidential.
Well knows alert president trump.

1009
00:47:26,490 --> 00:47:28,890
Several of those sorts of things have 
not been president,

1010
00:47:28,891 --> 00:47:30,190
so I'm glad you're acknowledging

1011
00:47:30,200 --> 00:47:31,033
it.
Yeah,

1012
00:47:31,200 --> 00:47:31,991
he can't though.
Right?

1013
00:47:31,991 --> 00:47:32,824
Because that's what got them there.
That's what's got him there and that's 

1014
00:47:34,391 --> 00:47:36,670
what people forget.
It worked and frankly,

1015
00:47:37,210 --> 00:47:40,270
as much as we talk about he's not 
reflecting America.

1016
00:47:40,550 --> 00:47:41,470
Yes he does.
He,

1017
00:47:41,490 --> 00:47:44,410
you know,
43 million americans voted for him.

1018
00:47:44,440 --> 00:47:47,290
Forty six for hillary and people don't 
factor the sin,

1019
00:47:47,291 --> 00:47:48,124
but $3 million.
Hillary won the state of great state of 

1020
00:47:49,811 --> 00:47:54,640
California by 3 million votes.
people forget that.

1021
00:47:54,641 --> 00:47:55,980
So pull those.
That $3,

1022
00:47:55,981 --> 00:47:59,620
million person spread was like here for 
the record.

1023
00:47:59,621 --> 00:48:00,454
I in California voted for Gary Johnson 
and judge me however you will see 

1024
00:48:04,390 --> 00:48:05,223
another judge me however you want,
but I suspect you would do I feel that 

1025
00:48:08,371 --> 00:48:10,740
of the ideas of gary did.
In fact I did that,

1026
00:48:10,840 --> 00:48:13,120
but you know,
we know he wasn't going to win so that's

1027
00:48:13,121 --> 00:48:14,410
a whole different conversation.
But I,

1028
00:48:14,430 --> 00:48:15,790
but I,
I'm in California.

1029
00:48:15,790 --> 00:48:17,910
It didn't matter which way.
Right.

1030
00:48:17,920 --> 00:48:22,920
That's like me in Washington dc for the 
democratic candidate was when full stop.

1031
00:48:22,960 --> 00:48:23,600
Right?
Yeah.

1032
00:48:23,600 --> 00:48:26,590
And again that gets back to the issue is
country is just,

1033
00:48:26,660 --> 00:48:27,493
you're,
you're in one camp or the other and it 

1034
00:48:29,261 --> 00:48:32,930
is when you think 46 and 43 million 
people we're calling,

1035
00:48:32,990 --> 00:48:33,823
we really divided.
I mean I just don't even know where the 

1036
00:48:36,041 --> 00:48:38,030
center is anymore.
That's,

1037
00:48:38,150 --> 00:48:40,270
that's troubling.
So to me,

1038
00:48:40,271 --> 00:48:41,104
the center basically is somewhat 
economically conservative in that you 

1039
00:48:45,521 --> 00:48:46,960
earn your money,
you should keep it.

1040
00:48:46,961 --> 00:48:49,600
And I also always argued that's the best
way.

1041
00:48:49,690 --> 00:48:50,523
If you hate trump,
the best way to limit government is to 

1042
00:48:52,421 --> 00:48:56,590
stop giving it so much money and power 
because sometime you know what?

1043
00:48:56,591 --> 00:48:59,590
You might get bernie and he can use a 
lot of power that you like,

1044
00:48:59,591 --> 00:49:00,970
but then sometimes you're gonna get a 
guy you don't like,

1045
00:49:00,971 --> 00:49:03,010
so let's just stop giving them so much 
power,

1046
00:49:03,220 --> 00:49:04,210
but in a weird way.

1047
00:49:04,450 --> 00:49:07,480
Does This all show that our system is 
working properly?

1048
00:49:07,540 --> 00:49:08,280
Well,
that's.

1049
00:49:08,280 --> 00:49:08,990
You know,
you,

1050
00:49:08,990 --> 00:49:12,010
you mentioned it earlier.
This is not a perfect system,

1051
00:49:12,220 --> 00:49:14,400
but I don't.
There's no other place in the world.

1052
00:49:14,401 --> 00:49:15,234
I'd rather be.
I thank god every day when I wake up 

1053
00:49:17,830 --> 00:49:18,750
and,
and,

1054
00:49:18,751 --> 00:49:19,584
and so you know that I'm here and it 
because we could have all been born 

1055
00:49:22,151 --> 00:49:24,640
somewhere else and this could have been 
a really bad situation.

1056
00:49:24,641 --> 00:49:25,474
It's not a perfect union,
but we're working towards it and that's 

1057
00:49:28,090 --> 00:49:28,923
the optimism,
but it's only if we have conversations 

1058
00:49:30,491 --> 00:49:31,990
like this,
the two of us,

1059
00:49:32,710 --> 00:49:35,680
this doesn't appear on mainstream 
television by the way.

1060
00:49:35,770 --> 00:49:38,560
That's the thing that I got to figure 
out how to get you.

1061
00:49:39,410 --> 00:49:41,080
Hey,
let me be your age,

1062
00:49:41,680 --> 00:49:43,570
but we have to get.
I believe you could do it.

1063
00:49:43,580 --> 00:49:44,413
I don't even know that I want it,
but I believe that really could because 

1064
00:49:47,230 --> 00:49:48,880
this voice is what's missing.

1065
00:49:48,940 --> 00:49:49,773
You're either msnbc or fox news,
you're rachel or your hannity and that 

1066
00:49:54,551 --> 00:49:57,400
by the way,
doesn't get us any closer to fixing this

1067
00:49:57,401 --> 00:49:58,234
because people then divide out.
That's What we've got to do because 

1068
00:50:01,241 --> 00:50:02,074
rational people can.
I think reasonable people can come to 

1069
00:50:04,751 --> 00:50:07,840
some conclusions that this is good for 
all of us.

1070
00:50:08,200 --> 00:50:09,033
You know,
relating this to sort of where we 

1071
00:50:09,941 --> 00:50:12,010
started as you're saying this,
I'm thinking,

1072
00:50:12,240 --> 00:50:13,360
you know,
there's something interesting here.

1073
00:50:13,361 --> 00:50:17,800
If this identity politics stuff wins the
day and they start taking more monuments

1074
00:50:17,801 --> 00:50:18,634
and we start judging Thomas Jefferson 
and the rest of the founders on the 

1075
00:50:22,030 --> 00:50:25,270
morals of today.
It's not just that we'll remove them,

1076
00:50:25,271 --> 00:50:28,150
but we'll actually all of good ideas,

1077
00:50:28,220 --> 00:50:31,310
all of their good ideas will have to go 
away.

1078
00:50:31,580 --> 00:50:33,940
They won't even if you're like a lot of 
those good ideas,

1079
00:50:33,950 --> 00:50:35,990
you know what I mean?
Like they won't just magically keep some

1080
00:50:35,991 --> 00:50:36,824
of the ideas what you're going to 
actually remove all of those ideas and 

1081
00:50:38,601 --> 00:50:42,180
then what are we left with and it ain't 
pretty right and,

1082
00:50:42,320 --> 00:50:45,530
and it's not America that that's the 
reality.

1083
00:50:45,531 --> 00:50:46,364
It's not America.
And that's something that we've all got 

1084
00:50:48,191 --> 00:50:52,740
to come to grips with is that this is 
not a good direction.

1085
00:50:52,770 --> 00:50:55,520
The trajectory is all wrong.
I'm pleased to say,

1086
00:50:55,521 --> 00:50:56,354
and all of us in the market,
so performing the financially you'll do 

1087
00:50:58,671 --> 00:50:59,660
well,
but by the way,

1088
00:50:59,661 --> 00:51:00,494
if you don't have any money,
you're not participating in the markets 

1089
00:51:02,020 --> 00:51:02,853
anyway.
Right?

1090
00:51:03,020 --> 00:51:05,430
So people like the two of us,
we're going to do fine.

1091
00:51:05,990 --> 00:51:09,560
Our families and significant others and 
stakeholders are going to do fine.

1092
00:51:09,830 --> 00:51:10,663
It's the rest of these folks who are 
being left out and they unfortunately 

1093
00:51:13,011 --> 00:51:18,011
are buying into this narrative that 
America is bad and somehow the magic fix

1094
00:51:19,501 --> 00:51:24,020
is to tax the wealthy.
like where does that end?

1095
00:51:24,080 --> 00:51:24,913
Like who.
And so is the appeal of that just 

1096
00:51:27,981 --> 00:51:30,320
because it takes,
it's sort of lazy thinking,

1097
00:51:31,310 --> 00:51:32,031
you know what I mean?
Like,

1098
00:51:32,031 --> 00:51:35,840
it just doesn't take much to be like,
I want what somebody else has.

1099
00:51:35,860 --> 00:51:37,160
Like,
it's kind of an easy answer.

1100
00:51:37,161 --> 00:51:40,340
like I don't have somebody all got.
They should gIve me some of that.

1101
00:51:40,341 --> 00:51:42,700
Like you don't have to think that hard.
Relax.

1102
00:51:42,701 --> 00:51:43,534
You have to think harder to understand 
why you shouldn't or don't deserve 

1103
00:51:46,341 --> 00:51:47,780
someone else's money.
Let's see.

1104
00:51:47,781 --> 00:51:48,590
I don't,
I,

1105
00:51:48,590 --> 00:51:50,210
and why?
Maybe.

1106
00:51:50,330 --> 00:51:55,230
But it's also equally lazy to think if I
were a zoo,

1107
00:51:55,280 --> 00:51:56,630
you know,
I'm a millionaire,

1108
00:51:56,930 --> 00:52:00,290
I wouldn't want to give more of my money
to someone else if I earned it.

1109
00:52:00,860 --> 00:52:02,900
Even if I bought a freaking lottery 
ticket,

1110
00:52:03,260 --> 00:52:03,801
uh,
you know,

1111
00:52:03,801 --> 00:52:04,634
just basic.
Take some person who's from a fragile 

1112
00:52:06,531 --> 00:52:09,500
community and who's got limited 
resources and you say to them,

1113
00:52:09,501 --> 00:52:11,990
you won the lottery tomorrow.
You want $2,000,000,

1114
00:52:11,991 --> 00:52:14,390
5 million of it goes to the federal 
government in your state.

1115
00:52:14,391 --> 00:52:16,670
How does that make you feel?
Bad.

1116
00:52:18,410 --> 00:52:19,520
That's lazy.
I mean,

1117
00:52:19,521 --> 00:52:22,640
you don't have a lot to say.
That's not a good result,

1118
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:24,120
right?
Yeah.

1119
00:52:24,500 --> 00:52:27,020
So I don't know why this is,
I don't know that it's easy.

1120
00:52:27,021 --> 00:52:29,930
I think it's,
we have just pounded into people's heads

1121
00:52:30,260 --> 00:52:33,860
that taking that the rich people are 
bad.

1122
00:52:33,890 --> 00:52:34,723
you're vilified for going to work 
everyday and making some good decisions 

1123
00:52:38,271 --> 00:52:40,430
and some luck and some god and some 
fate.

1124
00:52:40,610 --> 00:52:41,443
All of that into totality.
You're bad for having done well and the 

1125
00:52:44,601 --> 00:52:46,730
media plays it consistent.
They,

1126
00:52:46,950 --> 00:52:49,070
you belIeve it.
You believe it.

1127
00:52:49,130 --> 00:52:52,310
What do you think is the right amount of
government for us to have?

1128
00:52:52,940 --> 00:52:54,380
Um,
as much as we need.

1129
00:52:54,381 --> 00:52:57,140
I know that's not a great answer,
but I would literally,

1130
00:52:57,141 --> 00:52:58,520
I'm sort of,
I'm not sort of,

1131
00:52:58,530 --> 00:53:02,270
I'm very conservative in that respect.
I don't think you can have no government

1132
00:53:02,300 --> 00:53:04,130
[inaudible] then you have anarchy.
We need.

1133
00:53:04,160 --> 00:53:05,320
So you don't want mad max,
right?

1134
00:53:05,330 --> 00:53:07,190
I don't want that.
I mean if my house burns down,

1135
00:53:07,191 --> 00:53:08,024
I want to police department to show up.
I don't wanna have to rely on my three 

1136
00:53:10,310 --> 00:53:13,040
neighbors with buckets to come at a fire
department to show up.

1137
00:53:13,220 --> 00:53:14,053
So I think government,
the infrastructure is important of any 

1138
00:53:16,521 --> 00:53:17,354
society that will endure.
I do think that we've gotten too far 

1139
00:53:20,451 --> 00:53:21,284
though,
when you have just huge bureaucracy and 

1140
00:53:24,140 --> 00:53:26,010
departments designed to

1141
00:53:26,010 --> 00:53:30,090
solve problems that frankly will solve 
themselves amongst people.

1142
00:53:30,510 --> 00:53:31,343
Yeah,
but we become completely dependent on 

1143
00:53:32,431 --> 00:53:33,870
it.
Is there any way to scale it back?

1144
00:53:33,871 --> 00:53:34,704
That's one of the questions that I try 
to ask a lot of my more libertarian 

1145
00:53:36,961 --> 00:53:37,794
guests like it seems like this,
this thing has gotten so big and when 

1146
00:53:41,971 --> 00:53:44,070
you factor it in with,
you know,

1147
00:53:44,220 --> 00:53:47,760
handouts and all of this stuff that if 
you were ever to take it back,

1148
00:53:47,761 --> 00:53:48,421
a lot of people think,
well,

1149
00:53:48,421 --> 00:53:50,610
you just be screwing over all the poor 
people that.

1150
00:53:50,700 --> 00:53:52,200
Then I have some people who come on and 
say,

1151
00:53:52,201 --> 00:53:54,840
no,
you just cut it tomorrow and we see what

1152
00:53:54,841 --> 00:53:56,180
happens.
We'll charities come in.

1153
00:53:56,220 --> 00:53:59,220
We'll churches and synagogues and 
mosques and all that.

1154
00:53:59,221 --> 00:54:00,330
Well,
they pick up the slack,

1155
00:54:00,630 --> 00:54:01,171
you know,
will.

1156
00:54:01,171 --> 00:54:02,004
If you cut the funding until planned 
parenthood would barbara streisand and 

1157
00:54:04,051 --> 00:54:06,960
rosie and the rest of them suddenly put 
some of their money towards that.

1158
00:54:07,440 --> 00:54:10,720
I tend to think the answer is yes,
I do.

1159
00:54:10,800 --> 00:54:11,633
How do you,
how do you get that point across to 

1160
00:54:12,841 --> 00:54:13,680
people?
Well,

1161
00:54:14,160 --> 00:54:16,980
they're not going to do it unless forced
to do it,

1162
00:54:17,100 --> 00:54:19,380
so I think so that's something to be 
said for.

1163
00:54:19,381 --> 00:54:20,460
Just stop.
I mean,

1164
00:54:20,461 --> 00:54:22,650
what we saw puerto rico's a classic 
example.

1165
00:54:22,651 --> 00:54:24,220
We're all forced,
you know,

1166
00:54:24,450 --> 00:54:26,010
worried about what's happening in puerto
rico,

1167
00:54:26,250 --> 00:54:30,450
but this didn't start with a hurricane.
Puerto rico was a disaster.

1168
00:54:30,660 --> 00:54:33,450
I mean when I read something,
I was down there last year and they said

1169
00:54:33,451 --> 00:54:34,284
70 or so percent of the population work 
for the government like that has gotten 

1170
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:41,400
out of control and the only way you fix 
that,

1171
00:54:41,401 --> 00:54:42,750
you can't come in and say,
hey guys,

1172
00:54:43,350 --> 00:54:44,183
50 percent of you all should give up 
your government jobs for us to get this 

1173
00:54:46,951 --> 00:54:47,670
right.
No,

1174
00:54:47,670 --> 00:54:49,250
you're just gonna have to kind of just 
have to be.

1175
00:54:49,250 --> 00:54:51,240
You just have to.
And that's the.

1176
00:54:51,810 --> 00:54:52,643
Frankly,
that's the opportunity and I want to be 

1177
00:54:54,181 --> 00:54:55,740
careful here because I don't want,
I didn't,

1178
00:54:56,400 --> 00:54:58,800
I'm not a trump sarah got or anything 
else,

1179
00:54:59,490 --> 00:55:01,740
but that's the opportunity for someone 
like him.

1180
00:55:01,741 --> 00:55:04,890
I think we have just elected our first 
independent president.

1181
00:55:04,920 --> 00:55:08,970
I think it's the first time that America
has had someone who says what they think

1182
00:55:08,971 --> 00:55:09,804
for good or bad,
but and who is prepared to be unpopular 

1183
00:55:12,811 --> 00:55:13,644
because to make these sorts of decisions
you got to be unpopular and okay with 

1184
00:55:17,521 --> 00:55:18,354
that.
So was that his best line during the 

1185
00:55:19,531 --> 00:55:20,364
campaign?
When he said basically to the black 

1186
00:55:21,931 --> 00:55:22,860
community,
he was like,

1187
00:55:22,861 --> 00:55:25,020
what do you got to lose?
Do you think?

1188
00:55:25,021 --> 00:55:27,720
It was an actual.
It ended up being a good line because it

1189
00:55:27,721 --> 00:55:28,554
sounded off when I heard it.
And then I've talked to a lot of people 

1190
00:55:31,411 --> 00:55:33,840
and they kind of were like,
yeah,

1191
00:55:34,200 --> 00:55:36,960
all these democratic run cities,
chicago,

1192
00:55:36,961 --> 00:55:37,950
atlanta,
ferguson.

1193
00:55:38,830 --> 00:55:40,530
That's where it's the worst.
So it was funny.

1194
00:55:40,531 --> 00:55:41,670
I remembered,
I knew,

1195
00:55:41,730 --> 00:55:42,563
I know where I was at that moment when 
that happened and I was with a group of 

1196
00:55:45,001 --> 00:55:48,270
my friends and one of my friends who is 
as liberal as they come,

1197
00:55:48,271 --> 00:55:51,540
I've never sent me.
He drips and he said to me,

1198
00:55:52,410 --> 00:55:55,770
it was this moment like when you eat 
something that's bitter at first,

1199
00:55:55,771 --> 00:55:56,341
and then you're like,
oh,

1200
00:55:56,341 --> 00:55:57,720
that tastes good.
Ultimately.

1201
00:55:57,721 --> 00:56:00,960
Yeah.
And he said he's onto something and that

1202
00:56:00,961 --> 00:56:05,220
was when I knew that actually resonated.
I didn't feel good at first.

1203
00:56:05,221 --> 00:56:06,054
I mean I got it checked because it was a
little dismissive and frankly the 

1204
00:56:10,801 --> 00:56:11,634
african american community is still 
enjoying the fact that we elected our 

1205
00:56:15,601 --> 00:56:16,434
first african american president and 
frankly so are a lot of non african 

1206
00:56:19,731 --> 00:56:20,221
americans,
right?

1207
00:56:20,221 --> 00:56:21,054
It was a big deal.
So they felt like it was a shot at 

1208
00:56:24,461 --> 00:56:25,220
obama.

1209
00:56:25,220 --> 00:56:26,440
That's,
that was the issue.

1210
00:56:27,130 --> 00:56:29,710
If you had taken obama out of the 
equation,

1211
00:56:29,711 --> 00:56:33,850
having been the president,
it was a totally reasonable statement to

1212
00:56:33,851 --> 00:56:38,851
say ever the guy was before.
He didn't meaningfully change your life.

1213
00:56:41,050 --> 00:56:42,910
I am prepared to do what do you have to 
lose?

1214
00:56:42,911 --> 00:56:43,744
So I think you just,
if you took obama out of it and the 

1215
00:56:45,281 --> 00:56:48,070
pride associated with him being a,
you know,

1216
00:56:48,100 --> 00:56:49,620
a first,
um,

1217
00:56:49,720 --> 00:56:52,270
I think it was totally logical.
Ironically,

1218
00:56:52,271 --> 00:56:54,880
I think you can make a great argument 
that the president himself,

1219
00:56:54,881 --> 00:56:56,530
whether it's obama or trump or anybody 
else,

1220
00:56:56,710 --> 00:56:59,140
shouldn't have that much power over your
life.

1221
00:56:59,240 --> 00:56:59,690
Well,
that,

1222
00:56:59,690 --> 00:57:03,070
that would be my greater solutIon here.
That's my attitude.

1223
00:57:03,071 --> 00:57:03,600
People say,
well,

1224
00:57:03,600 --> 00:57:04,433
you know,
I wouldn't want to have lunch with 

1225
00:57:05,621 --> 00:57:06,431
Donald Trump.
I said,

1226
00:57:06,431 --> 00:57:07,850
and you're,
oh,

1227
00:57:08,350 --> 00:57:11,650
that's easy.
I want my president to do two things.

1228
00:57:11,830 --> 00:57:12,663
Literally I have sort of drawn it down 
to this national security and economic 

1229
00:57:17,831 --> 00:57:18,370
security.

1230
00:57:18,370 --> 00:57:20,950
I want the economy economy to be strong 
globally.

1231
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:24,250
I want them on it and then I want to 
make sure that the homeland is secure in

1232
00:57:24,251 --> 00:57:27,100
the context of a global kind of his,
so it's not just domestic,

1233
00:57:27,101 --> 00:57:29,560
but you got to do some things are 
nationally to protect your homeland.

1234
00:57:30,040 --> 00:57:30,873
Those two things.
I don't care what the president thinks 

1235
00:57:33,160 --> 00:57:37,150
about much of anything because he's a 
man just like I am and you are,

1236
00:57:37,151 --> 00:57:40,060
so he'll have an opinion about x and 
that's good for him.

1237
00:57:40,061 --> 00:57:42,370
Their supreme court does.
Congress has all of that stuff,

1238
00:57:42,520 --> 00:57:43,353
but I just want them to do two things.
Economic security and what I'll call 

1239
00:57:46,790 --> 00:57:49,060
homeland,
but security,

1240
00:57:49,090 --> 00:57:49,923
national security.
Is it funny to you how everybody's sort 

1241
00:57:52,331 --> 00:57:54,730
of flipped their opinions on almost 
everything these days?

1242
00:57:54,731 --> 00:57:55,564
Because as you're saying that,
I'm thinking if we just go back 20 

1243
00:57:57,551 --> 00:57:59,620
minutes when we were talking about daca,
it's like,

1244
00:57:59,621 --> 00:58:00,454
well suddenly democrats,
because they didn't like what trump was 

1245
00:58:01,871 --> 00:58:02,470
doing.

1246
00:58:02,470 --> 00:58:04,330
We're fighting for states' rights and 
it's like,

1247
00:58:04,331 --> 00:58:05,164
yeah,
I want you guys to fight rights all the 

1248
00:58:06,491 --> 00:58:07,324
time.
could then I'll start voting with you 

1249
00:58:07,991 --> 00:58:09,820
again.
We'll look at the obamacare,

1250
00:58:09,850 --> 00:58:13,340
the new proposed a affordable health 
care act.

1251
00:58:13,341 --> 00:58:13,931
By that,
you know,

1252
00:58:13,931 --> 00:58:17,500
the idea is black granite to the states.
I thought that's what we all want,

1253
00:58:17,760 --> 00:58:18,593
right?
It's and I was surprised to see some 

1254
00:58:19,841 --> 00:58:21,100
states.
Actually,

1255
00:58:21,190 --> 00:58:21,970
no,
we don't want it.

1256
00:58:21,970 --> 00:58:25,240
What do you mean you don't want it?
The ability of mr or ms.gov

1257
00:58:25,420 --> 00:58:26,253
to manage and take care of your 
citizenry with your dollars without the 

1258
00:58:29,081 --> 00:58:29,914
intervention of some people in 
Washington dc who know nothing about 

1259
00:58:32,321 --> 00:58:34,450
what happens in spokane,
Washington.

1260
00:58:34,990 --> 00:58:35,823
You don't want man.
To me that's like the most like perfect 

1261
00:58:38,081 --> 00:58:38,914
example of how screwed up our system is 
that a governor who is executor of the 

1262
00:58:42,191 --> 00:58:43,240
estate would be like,
no,

1263
00:58:43,241 --> 00:58:43,571
no,
no.

1264
00:58:43,571 --> 00:58:45,160
The thing that I'm supposed to do.
You do,

1265
00:58:45,610 --> 00:58:47,890
let's send it over there.
That way I'm free in the clear.

1266
00:58:47,891 --> 00:58:50,860
That's like the worst.
That's why people hate politicians.

1267
00:58:50,890 --> 00:58:52,850
That's why people hate the media.
It's like holding it.

1268
00:58:52,960 --> 00:58:54,670
I want.
I live in California,

1269
00:58:54,671 --> 00:58:55,504
which they're probably going to execute,
but in five years for a little freedom 

1270
00:58:59,910 --> 00:59:02,500
libertarian,
and believe me,

1271
00:59:02,501 --> 00:59:04,510
if they,
if they succeed from the unit,

1272
00:59:04,511 --> 00:59:06,020
I really can I move in with you.

1273
00:59:09,050 --> 00:59:12,460
I'll be in Missouri,
but that the Iowa,

1274
00:59:12,461 --> 00:59:13,460
that's what I do.
But.

1275
00:59:13,480 --> 00:59:17,350
But that point basically of everything's
being flipped right now.

1276
00:59:17,351 --> 00:59:19,090
Like everyone's kind of all over the 
place.

1277
00:59:19,150 --> 00:59:21,530
It's actually cool.
I mean that's all I know.

1278
00:59:21,531 --> 00:59:22,190
So many people

1279
00:59:22,190 --> 00:59:23,023
are depressed about it,
but what I've been trying to say is 

1280
00:59:25,100 --> 00:59:27,770
there's opportunity here.
It doesn't mean it's going to be bad.

1281
00:59:27,771 --> 00:59:28,604
It doesn't mean it's going to be good,
but let's get in there and fight for 

1282
00:59:30,771 --> 00:59:31,604
what you believe.
Even if you believe in the stuff that I 

1283
00:59:33,710 --> 00:59:34,700
abhor.
Right?

1284
00:59:34,730 --> 00:59:36,110
Right.
But they're lazy.

1285
00:59:36,150 --> 00:59:38,720
I mean that you use the right word.
People are lazy.

1286
00:59:38,750 --> 00:59:41,750
This is actually fascinating to watch.
Now I want to separate it.

1287
00:59:41,751 --> 00:59:43,300
Earlier I said,
you know,

1288
00:59:43,610 --> 00:59:46,040
I'm nervous about where this is going.
That's true.

1289
00:59:46,520 --> 00:59:47,353
I'm hopeful.
I'm not necessarily optimistic and 

1290
00:59:49,041 --> 00:59:50,390
there's a difference,
right?

1291
00:59:50,391 --> 00:59:54,500
yeah.
But I do enjoy watching the process,

1292
00:59:54,501 --> 00:59:57,530
the sausage making.
I do like to see that ultimately,

1293
00:59:57,680 --> 00:59:59,870
you know,
if you go back and look at some of the,

1294
00:59:59,871 --> 01:00:02,150
at least the reports of the early 
founding fathers,

1295
01:00:02,151 --> 01:00:03,980
it was ugly.
They hated each other.

1296
01:00:03,980 --> 01:00:04,813
It was divided like nothing you've ever 
seen and all of the what we refer to as 

1297
01:00:09,071 --> 01:00:10,610
going on in congress right now.
Hell,

1298
01:00:10,611 --> 01:00:15,200
it happened back then to this might be 
the american experience.

1299
01:00:15,260 --> 01:00:18,110
Right.
And you were just in time.

1300
01:00:18,111 --> 01:00:18,944
What we do is we put a painting,
we tell a story around it and it looks 

1301
01:00:21,951 --> 01:00:25,160
so wonderful and dramatic,
but the reality is it's ugly.

1302
01:00:25,760 --> 01:00:27,890
You know,
operating in this sort of a government,

1303
01:00:28,260 --> 01:00:29,540
this,
this model of,

1304
01:00:29,690 --> 01:00:30,523
of,
of governing is ugly and it's got to be 

1305
01:00:33,051 --> 01:00:34,700
ugly or I mean,
what's the option?

1306
01:00:34,701 --> 01:00:35,534
I mean,
I think that's what people don't 

1307
01:00:36,141 --> 01:00:38,600
understand is like if anything's going 
to work,

1308
01:00:38,601 --> 01:00:41,570
it kind of has to be ugly.
That mean the sausage factory there.

1309
01:00:41,590 --> 01:00:43,280
I think nobody wants to see how it gets 
made,

1310
01:00:43,281 --> 01:00:44,210
but you don't like it.
No.

1311
01:00:44,240 --> 01:00:45,140
Shit like it.
While I was,

1312
01:00:45,270 --> 01:00:46,910
I was reading the other day,
I know you've seen it,

1313
01:00:46,911 --> 01:00:47,900
the comments,
um,

1314
01:00:48,110 --> 01:00:50,120
vayner is now talking about what 
happened,

1315
01:00:50,300 --> 01:00:51,133
you know,
god suddenly the man's curse of his 

1316
01:00:53,200 --> 01:00:55,910
marines and the idea that,
you know,

1317
01:00:56,080 --> 01:00:56,913
some way literally he said got either 
pulled a gun or a knife on him or 

1318
01:00:59,361 --> 01:00:59,750
something.

1319
01:00:59,750 --> 01:01:02,320
One of his fellow members of congress 
and uh,

1320
01:01:02,390 --> 01:01:05,900
iT's just fascinated.
Literally he's had an and but that's.

1321
01:01:05,901 --> 01:01:10,901
And that's within the party.
So the idea that somehow the tension is,

1322
01:01:13,340 --> 01:01:15,950
is bad,
maybe not so much.

1323
01:01:16,100 --> 01:01:17,840
Yeah.
It's also funny because like,

1324
01:01:17,841 --> 01:01:19,190
you know,
you'll always hear all the,

1325
01:01:19,280 --> 01:01:21,080
all these media people and politicians 
and be like,

1326
01:01:21,290 --> 01:01:23,360
house of cards is the most realistic 
show ever.

1327
01:01:23,660 --> 01:01:24,493
And it's like,
well there's an awful lot of murder and 

1328
01:01:25,341 --> 01:01:28,190
drug use and evil backdoor deals and 
you're just,

1329
01:01:28,220 --> 01:01:31,520
you guys are all kind of telling us that
are all showing it to us.

1330
01:01:31,620 --> 01:01:32,453
All right,
well we could go a rabbit hole on that 

1331
01:01:34,401 --> 01:01:35,210
one.
So let's,

1332
01:01:35,210 --> 01:01:37,130
let's shift to your future.
Because you mentioned,

1333
01:01:37,160 --> 01:01:40,460
you mentioned earlier,
so you are leaving the organization that

1334
01:01:40,490 --> 01:01:42,220
basically then the next month.
Right,

1335
01:01:42,340 --> 01:01:43,173
and where are you going?
What are you doing going to run an 

1336
01:01:44,931 --> 01:01:48,050
organization called the society for 
human resource management?

1337
01:01:48,080 --> 01:01:51,200
Sure,
and it's the world's largest association

1338
01:01:51,201 --> 01:01:52,034
dedicated to human resources,
so trade association for the profession 

1339
01:01:55,880 --> 01:01:58,510
of human resources professionals and you
know,

1340
01:01:58,550 --> 01:01:59,660
so some have said,
wow,

1341
01:01:59,690 --> 01:02:00,523
that's kind of out there.
Will know it isn't for for a couple of 

1342
01:02:03,020 --> 01:02:03,830
reasons.
First of all,

1343
01:02:03,830 --> 01:02:05,870
I've been in higher ed for the last 
seven and a half years.

1344
01:02:05,871 --> 01:02:08,360
If you ask nine out of 10 college 
students,

1345
01:02:08,361 --> 01:02:11,780
why did you go to college?
Is to get a good job period.

1346
01:02:11,960 --> 01:02:12,793
So it's a very natural kind of thing.
There's no point of going if this 

1347
01:02:15,831 --> 01:02:19,770
doesn't turn into some way to provide.
The other thing though is it's a natural

1348
01:02:19,771 --> 01:02:24,300
sort of evolution in my career.
I now understand higher ed.

1349
01:02:24,480 --> 01:02:25,313
Actually.
I think I have a really good 

1350
01:02:25,741 --> 01:02:29,670
understanding of all of the education.
So pk through 16,

1351
01:02:30,990 --> 01:02:33,630
we've now got a connected.
There's not an article that comes out.

1352
01:02:33,630 --> 01:02:36,720
We're employers say the system is not 
giving me what I want.

1353
01:02:36,990 --> 01:02:37,823
The students who are graduating don't 
have the skills that we need and so 

1354
01:02:40,051 --> 01:02:40,884
they're frustrated because I'm paying 
taxes to pay for this system education 

1355
01:02:43,741 --> 01:02:45,900
system and the what comes out on the 
other end.

1356
01:02:46,110 --> 01:02:49,590
The assembly line model is really bad.
I paid for all of this and at the end of

1357
01:02:49,591 --> 01:02:50,424
the car I don't like it.
So I think this gives me an opportunitY 

1358
01:02:52,741 --> 01:02:56,330
to take what I've done for the last 
seven and a half years and now take,

1359
01:02:56,340 --> 01:02:57,173
get industry,
bring the two together and say let's 

1360
01:02:59,071 --> 01:02:59,904
figure out how to make this system work.
We're spending a lot of money as a 

1361
01:03:02,461 --> 01:03:03,294
country on education and to what end.
So what are some of the ways you could 

1362
01:03:07,260 --> 01:03:08,910
shift education?
I mean,

1363
01:03:08,911 --> 01:03:09,744
I think the basic premises of get people
to listen and get people to really 

1364
01:03:12,510 --> 01:03:13,343
understand what they believe in,
but is there something that's like a 

1365
01:03:14,401 --> 01:03:16,890
little more concrete that you're going 
to go in and be like,

1366
01:03:16,891 --> 01:03:17,400
guys,
let's.

1367
01:03:17,400 --> 01:03:18,880
This is what we got to change.
Yeah.

1368
01:03:18,930 --> 01:03:20,220
You know,
you know the,

1369
01:03:20,221 --> 01:03:22,830
the current administration is talking a 
lot about apprenticeships.

1370
01:03:22,831 --> 01:03:23,664
For example,
the end gain can't be everyone goes to 

1371
01:03:25,500 --> 01:03:26,333
four year college and I think we went 
that way for too long and that didn't 

1372
01:03:29,251 --> 01:03:30,084
work.
So the idea is to figure out 

1373
01:03:31,351 --> 01:03:32,184
credentialing,
to figure out what are the specific 

1374
01:03:34,141 --> 01:03:34,974
skills that one needs to go into the 
21st century economy industry has to 

1375
01:03:38,431 --> 01:03:43,431
tell us that since they are ultimately 
the consumer of this education product,

1376
01:03:44,160 --> 01:03:45,450
and then we got to go back and say,
okay,

1377
01:03:45,451 --> 01:03:46,284
now you've got to tweak your system.
I know you all don't like being 

1378
01:03:48,211 --> 01:03:51,180
vocations,
vocational schools and you want to teach

1379
01:03:51,181 --> 01:03:53,430
people how to think and solve the 
world's problems,

1380
01:03:53,580 --> 01:03:54,413
but the vast majority of the folks who 
come through your system are doing what 

1381
01:03:57,090 --> 01:03:58,170
they're trying to get a job.

1382
01:03:58,560 --> 01:04:00,570
So that's what we're going to do.
Concretely.

1383
01:04:00,571 --> 01:04:04,230
Bringing those education and industry 
together and say,

1384
01:04:04,320 --> 01:04:05,153
let's figure this out.
We've got to rethink and talking about 

1385
01:04:07,411 --> 01:04:08,244
disruption.
I predict that higher education in 

1386
01:04:10,501 --> 01:04:13,410
particular is going to be disrupted in a
way as a,

1387
01:04:13,620 --> 01:04:14,940
as a business,
as a sector,

1388
01:04:14,941 --> 01:04:15,774
like nothing you've ever seen.
The pieces are all there for that right 

1389
01:04:18,091 --> 01:04:18,924
now because we see the schools that a 
lot of the schools that have gone down 

1390
01:04:21,391 --> 01:04:22,224
the sjw route are really struggling.
Mizzou is majorly struggling and 

1391
01:04:25,651 --> 01:04:28,560
enrollment.
We know evergreen state struggling.

1392
01:04:28,561 --> 01:04:29,400
I mean,
well,

1393
01:04:29,401 --> 01:04:30,234
you have another problem.
America and americans just had fewer 

1394
01:04:32,371 --> 01:04:34,610
babies.
The reality is we,

1395
01:04:34,640 --> 01:04:35,220
we,
uh,

1396
01:04:35,220 --> 01:04:36,053
we've seen there are fewer students 
graduating high school this year than 

1397
01:04:39,481 --> 01:04:42,660
last year and the year before.
So what we're seeing is a problem.

1398
01:04:42,661 --> 01:04:43,494
You're just not going to have the same 
number of bodies to come into that 

1399
01:04:46,741 --> 01:04:50,820
traditional college environment that we 
created with dorms and everything else.

1400
01:04:50,820 --> 01:04:54,330
So now we are nontraditional student has
to be our traditional students.

1401
01:04:54,660 --> 01:04:56,340
That's got to be a little ironic for you
in a way.

1402
01:04:56,341 --> 01:04:57,174
You come from the higher ed thing,
you care so much about it and yet you 

1403
01:04:58,801 --> 01:04:59,634
can also acknowledge that a certain 
amount of people just because of the 

1404
01:05:01,771 --> 01:05:02,604
reality of economics,
don't necessarily need all of that 

1405
01:05:05,461 --> 01:05:08,550
education that you know that's right,
and it's going to be lifelong,

1406
01:05:08,880 --> 01:05:09,713
you know,
it's the idea that we came out of the 

1407
01:05:11,131 --> 01:05:13,080
generation where you get your education,
your bachelors,

1408
01:05:13,081 --> 01:05:14,610
your masters or doctorate,
what have you get,

1409
01:05:14,760 --> 01:05:15,593
and then you go into the workplace and 
do it for 30 years and you retire and 

1410
01:05:18,611 --> 01:05:22,210
now because the economy is changing so 
much,

1411
01:05:22,211 --> 01:05:23,044
every five to seven years,
industries go away that we were taught 

1412
01:05:26,170 --> 01:05:28,180
to participate in.
They go away.

1413
01:05:28,270 --> 01:05:30,700
And so that's.
I'm so excited about that.

1414
01:05:30,940 --> 01:05:31,900
Finally,
you know,

1415
01:05:31,901 --> 01:05:36,250
sort of related to that America is 
browning and graying at once.

1416
01:05:36,700 --> 01:05:37,533
So underlying all of this is we've got 
to figure out how to get the system to 

1417
01:05:42,821 --> 01:05:46,630
appreciate a very different America.
It's not black and white anymore.

1418
01:05:46,631 --> 01:05:47,650
It's brown,
it's yellow,

1419
01:05:47,651 --> 01:05:50,590
it's everything.
And how these workers,

1420
01:05:50,591 --> 01:05:51,424
as they come out of college or whatever 
their educational backgrounds are when 

1421
01:05:55,091 --> 01:05:57,820
they come into the workplace,
how do we grow our economy?

1422
01:05:58,090 --> 01:05:58,923
Uh,
and we've got to use people to do it 

1423
01:06:00,100 --> 01:06:01,900
right.
And that's what I'm excited about,

1424
01:06:01,901 --> 01:06:04,700
sherman and higher education and just 
trying to figure out how to tie that all

1425
01:06:04,710 --> 01:06:05,700
together.
Yeah.

1426
01:06:05,830 --> 01:06:06,551
Well,
I gotta tell you,

1427
01:06:06,551 --> 01:06:06,751
man,
I,

1428
01:06:06,751 --> 01:06:09,520
I thoroughly enjoyed this.
I'm not surprised because as I said,

1429
01:06:09,521 --> 01:06:11,650
I saw you once and I was like,
this guy's going to do it.

1430
01:06:11,651 --> 01:06:15,220
But I think the real beauty of this is 
that you're not just saying this stuff,

1431
01:06:15,221 --> 01:06:16,660
you're actually out there doing it.

1432
01:06:16,660 --> 01:06:19,240
And I believe that that's right.
I don't believe,

1433
01:06:19,241 --> 01:06:20,074
you know,
this isn't about my desire to run for 

1434
01:06:21,611 --> 01:06:23,480
office or to get a job.
Um,

1435
01:06:23,770 --> 01:06:26,770
I really believe this.
This is something that it keeps me up at

1436
01:06:26,771 --> 01:06:27,604
night.
How can people like the two of us 

1437
01:06:29,620 --> 01:06:32,550
changed the narrative.
Thank you.

1438
01:06:32,700 --> 01:06:35,350
Thank you for.
I feel like I gotta I gotta give you one

1439
01:06:35,351 --> 01:06:36,490
more here.
That'll all right.

1440
01:06:36,491 --> 01:06:37,990
What would you say,
what would you say that.

1441
01:06:37,991 --> 01:06:38,824
Well,
thank you.

1442
01:06:38,890 --> 01:06:41,500
But what would you say then to the to 
the people,

1443
01:06:41,620 --> 01:06:45,370
whether they're college students right 
now or whether they're middle aged,

1444
01:06:45,371 --> 01:06:47,890
whatever it is that want to get in the 
fight,

1445
01:06:48,010 --> 01:06:50,830
but are afraid because of all the 
silencing factors.

1446
01:06:50,920 --> 01:06:51,780
You know what I mean?
Yeah.

1447
01:06:51,850 --> 01:06:52,870
Know two things.
First of all,

1448
01:06:52,871 --> 01:06:56,290
you need courage.
You've got to intestinal courage.

1449
01:06:56,291 --> 01:06:58,150
You got to just go down and decide this 
is the,

1450
01:06:58,450 --> 01:07:00,040
this is where I want to go.

1451
01:07:00,940 --> 01:07:03,100
And by the way,
that means transferring schools.

1452
01:07:03,310 --> 01:07:04,143
If that means changing the people you 
spend time around because you know it 

1453
01:07:08,260 --> 01:07:10,990
can be debilitating in some ways,
then do it.

1454
01:07:11,140 --> 01:07:12,430
I mean,
it's just the only way to do it.

1455
01:07:12,431 --> 01:07:14,650
The other thing is I would encourage all
americans.

1456
01:07:14,651 --> 01:07:15,484
We've got to listen more.
The most frustrating thing to me now is 

1457
01:07:18,431 --> 01:07:19,264
we're so busy talking and frankly 
talking over others that we just won't 

1458
01:07:22,601 --> 01:07:23,434
pause and listen.
That's the beginning of changing the 

1459
01:07:26,651 --> 01:07:28,900
narrative because as you're listening,
you're going to one,

1460
01:07:29,200 --> 01:07:31,990
the other person will respect you.
Now because you've listened to them,

1461
01:07:32,050 --> 01:07:34,570
and in the process you actually might 
learn something.

1462
01:07:34,600 --> 01:07:35,500
You might say,
you know,

1463
01:07:35,501 --> 01:07:39,700
the world is a little different than I 
perceived it to be because I got it from

1464
01:07:39,701 --> 01:07:40,534
someone else's perspective.
That's the beauty of diversity by the 

1465
01:07:42,071 --> 01:07:42,904
way.
It's not just gender and race and 

1466
01:07:44,591 --> 01:07:45,430
national origin.

1467
01:07:45,700 --> 01:07:49,480
It's diverse perspectives.
How another person sees the world.

1468
01:07:49,630 --> 01:07:51,580
If we can get those two things now,
first of all,

1469
01:07:51,581 --> 01:07:53,560
listen,
But then courage.

1470
01:07:53,680 --> 01:07:56,380
It takes a lot frankly for me to be 
right here,

1471
01:07:56,590 --> 01:07:57,423
the best thing in the world.
If I aspire to be a congressman and a 

1472
01:07:59,591 --> 01:08:01,570
member of the cbc and dah,
dah,

1473
01:08:01,690 --> 01:08:04,180
dah,
there's a narrative that I'm supposed to

1474
01:08:04,181 --> 01:08:07,750
follow and you've got to decide that,
that that doesn't matter.

1475
01:08:07,751 --> 01:08:10,030
What's more important is that the 
american story,

1476
01:08:10,031 --> 01:08:10,864
100 years from now is,
is a much better story because I was 

1477
01:08:13,691 --> 01:08:15,770
here.
I love it.

1478
01:08:15,890 --> 01:08:16,180
That's

1479
01:08:16,180 --> 01:08:18,440
a closing statement and for more on 
johnny,

1480
