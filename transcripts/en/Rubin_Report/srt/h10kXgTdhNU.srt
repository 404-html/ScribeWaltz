1
00:00:04,660 --> 00:00:08,290
Joining me today as an entrepreneur and 
venture capitalist and author,

2
00:00:08,291 --> 00:00:12,160
the Co founder of Paypal,
the first outside investor in facebook,

3
00:00:12,430 --> 00:00:17,430
the founder of Palentier and Silicon 
Valley's ultimate contrarian thinker 

4
00:00:17,620 --> 00:00:18,820
Peter Teal.
Finally,

5
00:00:18,821 --> 00:00:20,110
welcome to the Rubin report.
David,

6
00:00:20,111 --> 00:00:22,900
thanks for having me on the show.
It's good to be here with you.

7
00:00:23,230 --> 00:00:26,440
I normally don't have this many cards 
for a guest,

8
00:00:26,441 --> 00:00:27,010
but,
uh,

9
00:00:27,011 --> 00:00:29,170
I've got a lot of cards for you today.
Are you ready to roll?

10
00:00:29,260 --> 00:00:30,230
Ready to go?
Alright.

11
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:35,280
So we have to start.
Obviously Rogan had allowed muskeg last 

12
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:35,530
week,
last week,

13
00:00:35,590 --> 00:00:40,590
and they smoked a joint.
So do you want me to put the joint on 

14
00:00:40,590 --> 00:00:40,590
the table right now or how are we doing 
this?

15
00:00:40,590 --> 00:00:40,590
You know,
my,

16
00:00:40,590 --> 00:00:42,520
my number one rule is never to compete 
with the.

17
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:45,210
I'll,
you know,

18
00:00:45,220 --> 00:00:47,350
I would never,
I would never bet against Ilan.

19
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:48,990
Uh,
it's uh,

20
00:00:49,150 --> 00:00:50,110
it's been like this,
uh,

21
00:00:50,510 --> 00:00:54,490
I've been,
I was a close partner of visit paypal in

22
00:00:54,491 --> 00:00:54,880
the,
uh,

23
00:00:55,300 --> 00:00:58,060
in the late nineties,
early two thousands and uh,

24
00:00:58,450 --> 00:01:00,550
and uh,
after pay pal,

25
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:02,710
you know,
Elon set out to start these two,

26
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:05,740
both the rocket company and the,
uh,

27
00:01:05,770 --> 00:01:07,120
the uh,
electric car company,

28
00:01:07,121 --> 00:01:08,200
space x and Tesla.

29
00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:13,610
And I think the conventional wisdom on 
Ilan was these were both completely 

30
00:01:13,610 --> 00:01:17,401
harebrained projects and if one of them 
had succeeded that you have to sort of 

31
00:01:17,651 --> 00:01:19,840
question it.
And when both of them succeeded,

32
00:01:20,170 --> 00:01:21,350
it's just that,
you know,

33
00:01:21,460 --> 00:01:23,290
he knows something people,
other people don't.

34
00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:25,240
All right,
well on that can be a matter of luck.

35
00:01:25,330 --> 00:01:30,330
I'll keep,
I'll keep the joint right here for now 

36
00:01:30,330 --> 00:01:30,330
so I can compete with you on.
All right.

37
00:01:30,330 --> 00:01:34,051
But let that,
that's a good place to start because 

38
00:01:34,051 --> 00:01:34,051
first,
you know,

39
00:01:34,051 --> 00:01:35,710
it's interesting because we've gotten to
know each other a little bit in the last

40
00:01:35,710 --> 00:01:38,920
couple of years and it seems to me that 
the person that I know privately is sort

41
00:01:38,921 --> 00:01:41,620
of different than the way the way the 
media portrays you.

42
00:01:41,650 --> 00:01:44,890
So I thought maybe at the beginning 
let's just do a little history about you

43
00:01:44,891 --> 00:01:49,891
and then we can get to some of the 
controversies in some of the ideas that 

44
00:01:49,891 --> 00:01:49,891
you're really interested and things like
that.

45
00:01:49,891 --> 00:01:52,390
So let's start with paypal since you 
mentioned it already.

46
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:55,870
Where did the idea of paypal first come 
from?

47
00:01:56,740 --> 00:01:57,220
Well,
you know,

48
00:01:57,221 --> 00:01:58,420
it's,
it's when,

49
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:00,370
when you start one of these companies,
uh,

50
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:02,650
it's,
it's typically not the case that you get

51
00:02:02,651 --> 00:02:05,520
the whole idea fully formed,
you know,

52
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:07,600
instantaneously.
We certainly,

53
00:02:07,910 --> 00:02:12,910
uh,
there was this incredible internet boom 

54
00:02:12,910 --> 00:02:13,090
going on in silicon valley in the late 
nineties.

55
00:02:13,091 --> 00:02:16,390
It felt that there was sort of this open
frontier,

56
00:02:16,570 --> 00:02:21,570
open gold rush.
One of the natural things to look at 

57
00:02:21,570 --> 00:02:21,880
was,
was finance.

58
00:02:21,881 --> 00:02:25,150
I was sort of very interested in the 
cryptocurrency.

59
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:28,180
Could there be new forms of money?
And there's always something super,

60
00:02:28,181 --> 00:02:30,580
uh,
a mysterious,

61
00:02:30,581 --> 00:02:32,320
powerful,
important about money.

62
00:02:32,321 --> 00:02:32,710
And it was,
it was,

63
00:02:32,711 --> 00:02:34,570
it was the way that this was going to 
change.

64
00:02:34,571 --> 00:02:39,571
So we had,
I think we had this general idea to do 

65
00:02:39,571 --> 00:02:40,780
something with security,
with money,

66
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:45,130
with payments from very early on of the 
founding of the company,

67
00:02:45,340 --> 00:02:49,180
and then you iterate a lot on how to,
how to get the idea out and the,

68
00:02:49,181 --> 00:02:54,181
the critical question for any consumer 
internet product is always not what the 

69
00:02:54,181 --> 00:02:55,780
idea is,
but how do you get it out?

70
00:02:55,810 --> 00:02:58,480
How do you get the distribution out?
And we spent,

71
00:02:58,630 --> 00:03:01,950
there've been a of payments companies,
internet payments companies that have,

72
00:03:02,060 --> 00:03:05,440
that are already started and failed by 
1998.

73
00:03:05,740 --> 00:03:10,740
There was one called one called a was 
cyber cash through or you know,

74
00:03:11,841 --> 00:03:12,180
the,
the,

75
00:03:12,210 --> 00:03:15,610
there's sort of a variety of these 
different ones that have tried to create

76
00:03:15,611 --> 00:03:18,790
these comprehensive currency schemes.
Um,

77
00:03:19,010 --> 00:03:20,530
and they would work if everybody used 
them,

78
00:03:20,710 --> 00:03:24,580
but you can never get even the first 
person to start at sort of the challenge

79
00:03:24,581 --> 00:03:29,581
was how to make it viral.
How do you get something to work where 

80
00:03:29,581 --> 00:03:32,700
it's good for the first person,
for the 10th person to the hundredth 

81
00:03:32,700 --> 00:03:32,700
person in.
Once we have millions of people,

82
00:03:32,700 --> 00:03:36,580
you have a network of network effects 
and that was sort of the chicken and egg

83
00:03:36,581 --> 00:03:41,581
problem.
How did you guys overcome that hurdle 

84
00:03:41,581 --> 00:03:44,370
where we eventually stumbled on this 
idea of linking money with email because

85
00:03:44,561 --> 00:03:46,360
there were ready 300 million people in 
[inaudible],

86
00:03:46,361 --> 00:03:51,361
99 that had email accounts and,
and so if you could send money to an 

87
00:03:52,181 --> 00:03:57,181
email address,
send it to your email and then you get 

88
00:03:57,181 --> 00:04:00,961
an email saying you've received cash and
then you'd obviously click on the links 

89
00:04:00,961 --> 00:04:02,290
and do the work necessary to get the 
money out.

90
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:03,320
And so,
um,

91
00:04:03,580 --> 00:04:08,580
and so you didn't need both counterpart 
to a transaction to be part of the 

92
00:04:08,741 --> 00:04:11,140
paypal network.
Only the sender could be part of it.

93
00:04:11,410 --> 00:04:15,070
And then the recipient,
the recipient would sign up as they took

94
00:04:15,071 --> 00:04:16,240
the money out.
And uh,

95
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:19,640
and then we started with the 24 people 
in our office.

96
00:04:19,650 --> 00:04:24,650
Those were the first 24 customers and 
they sent money to friends and to other 

97
00:04:24,650 --> 00:04:26,110
people.
We gave these referral bonuses.

98
00:04:26,111 --> 00:04:28,150
We gave you $10.
You signed up and $10.

99
00:04:28,151 --> 00:04:31,870
She got someone to sign up and it just 
grew exponentially when we were,

100
00:04:31,871 --> 00:04:36,871
you know,
it grew about seven to 10 percent 

101
00:04:36,871 --> 00:04:37,540
compounding daily and if you're,
you know,

102
00:04:37,990 --> 00:04:42,990
an image to start with a small number,
if you get seven to 10 percent daily 

103
00:04:42,990 --> 00:04:45,961
compounding and after about a month,
year to thousand people by those mid 

104
00:04:45,961 --> 00:04:49,090
November of 99 by end of December of 
[inaudible] 99,

105
00:04:49,091 --> 00:04:51,940
it was a $12,000
by February third,

106
00:04:51,941 --> 00:04:52,480
2000.

107
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:54,700
It was at 100,000
by mid April,

108
00:04:54,701 --> 00:04:56,710
2000 goes up to a million.
And so.

109
00:04:56,770 --> 00:05:01,770
So what did you do in terms of getting 
people to understand the way you could 

110
00:05:02,140 --> 00:05:07,140
work with money differently?
Because I actually remember the first 

111
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:10,261
time I used paypal,
I think it was in 2001 I was a 

112
00:05:10,261 --> 00:05:10,900
struggling comic.
I had moved into a roommates,

113
00:05:11,230 --> 00:05:13,420
a little apartment because I didn't have
much money and I,

114
00:05:13,550 --> 00:05:18,550
but I had to pay him a couple of hundred
bucks or something a month for a for 

115
00:05:18,550 --> 00:05:19,090
rent and he was going to give him a 
check.

116
00:05:19,091 --> 00:05:19,810
He said,
hey pal,

117
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:23,560
me and the,
just the idea that I was somehow linking

118
00:05:23,561 --> 00:05:26,920
my bank account to something on the 
computer.

119
00:05:27,110 --> 00:05:29,230
We didn't even have,
I don't know if I'm not mistaken.

120
00:05:29,231 --> 00:05:31,480
I think I was still using dialup.
I don't even know that we,

121
00:05:31,540 --> 00:05:32,130
you know,
had,

122
00:05:32,230 --> 00:05:37,230
had wifi or anything like that,
but it's about an idea that this can 

123
00:05:37,230 --> 00:05:37,230
even happen.

124
00:05:37,230 --> 00:05:39,640
How did you train people to realize,
well,

125
00:05:39,641 --> 00:05:41,920
it's always something that's real and 
it's always on.

126
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:45,510
You normally serve to get people start 
doing something like that.

127
00:05:45,511 --> 00:05:49,180
It has to be something where there's an 
intense need and um,

128
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:54,360
and maybe it's not too dangerous.
And so the know one of the natural 

129
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:56,881
places that started was on the Ebay 
auction site where small dollar 

130
00:05:56,881 --> 00:05:58,550
transactions,
maybe $40 with the typical amount.

131
00:05:58,970 --> 00:06:01,610
And if you send chuck across the 
country,

132
00:06:01,850 --> 00:06:04,350
that's like a seven to 10 delay,
10 day delay.

133
00:06:04,351 --> 00:06:05,600
It's slow.
Um,

134
00:06:05,660 --> 00:06:10,660
most,
most people aren't set up to process 

135
00:06:10,660 --> 00:06:12,821
credit cards.
You roommate probably couldn't process 

136
00:06:12,821 --> 00:06:12,821
credit cards and so,
uh,

137
00:06:12,821 --> 00:06:14,450
and so unit.
But since you could make paypal payments

138
00:06:14,451 --> 00:06:19,451
with a credit card,
you could in fact send a credit card 

139
00:06:19,451 --> 00:06:19,960
payment to,
um,

140
00:06:20,090 --> 00:06:25,090
300 million people,
whereas they're only something like 

141
00:06:25,090 --> 00:06:27,881
three or 4 million that are set up to 
process a 150 million people with emails

142
00:06:28,431 --> 00:06:33,431
in theU ,
s at the time and there may be $3 

143
00:06:33,431 --> 00:06:33,431
million that were set up to process 
credit cards,

144
00:06:33,431 --> 00:06:33,830
small businesses,
things like that.

145
00:06:33,830 --> 00:06:38,830
So we expanded it by 147 million.
Do you remember what it felt like as it 

146
00:06:38,830 --> 00:06:40,460
started compounding the way you're 
talking about?

147
00:06:40,461 --> 00:06:43,010
Like what was that like as it was 
growing and you realize like,

148
00:06:43,011 --> 00:06:44,840
wow,
we really have this.

149
00:06:44,870 --> 00:06:48,080
Well,
you are at the forefront of some sort of

150
00:06:48,140 --> 00:06:50,040
revolutionary thing.
It,

151
00:06:50,450 --> 00:06:53,870
it's incredibly exciting and it's 
incredibly scary.

152
00:06:53,871 --> 00:06:58,871
And it was a,
it was going to take over the world are 

153
00:06:58,871 --> 00:06:58,871
all going to die and move several times 
between,

154
00:06:58,871 --> 00:07:02,060
you know that those two,
several times a day.

155
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:07,480
Was there any bizarre pushback from 
banks or any anyone that was doing 

156
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:08,300
financial transactions?
Traditionally,

157
00:07:08,390 --> 00:07:12,260
there were certainly like more than more
than our share of challenges.

158
00:07:12,261 --> 00:07:17,261
You had a,
you had an enormous problem of fraud 

159
00:07:17,261 --> 00:07:19,571
where people just figured out ways to 
hack the system and steal money and 

160
00:07:19,571 --> 00:07:19,571
then,
um,

161
00:07:19,571 --> 00:07:24,190
and you can't simply get rid of fraud 
because you always get flooded and make 

162
00:07:24,190 --> 00:07:24,190
it cumbersome.

163
00:07:24,190 --> 00:07:28,480
If it's easy,
then it's also easy to defraud your 

164
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:31,110
challenges.
How do you get it to be easy to use but 

165
00:07:31,110 --> 00:07:31,110
hard to defraud.
And that took,

166
00:07:31,110 --> 00:07:31,800
it,
took some time there.

167
00:07:31,801 --> 00:07:34,490
Um,
certainly a banks didn't like it,

168
00:07:34,910 --> 00:07:36,750
you know,
the role of the incumbent players that,

169
00:07:37,010 --> 00:07:42,010
that didn't like something new.
And then of course it was sort of in 

170
00:07:42,010 --> 00:07:42,010
this,
in this,

171
00:07:42,010 --> 00:07:46,001
uh,
strange regulatory zone where it was a 

172
00:07:46,001 --> 00:07:46,040
new form of payments,
new form of moving money.

173
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:48,370
And uh,
and the,

174
00:07:48,490 --> 00:07:53,490
the way I often thought of it at the 
time was that we were in a race between 

175
00:07:53,490 --> 00:07:55,460
technology and politics and you know,
the politicians didn't like us,

176
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:58,940
but if we got the system,
the paypal network to be big enough,

177
00:07:59,210 --> 00:08:04,210
it would sort of overwhelm the 
regulators and they'd have to accept 

178
00:08:04,210 --> 00:08:04,210
that as a,
as a fait accompli.

179
00:08:04,210 --> 00:08:06,680
So the Libertarian Party,
you must have love that concept,

180
00:08:06,681 --> 00:08:11,681
like you were actually doing something 
that libertarians are supposed to do 

181
00:08:11,681 --> 00:08:11,681
here.

182
00:08:11,681 --> 00:08:13,410
There was a early 2000 conversation,
uh,

183
00:08:13,510 --> 00:08:14,080
you know,
one of the,

184
00:08:14,380 --> 00:08:16,480
one of the execs that paypal said that,
you know,

185
00:08:16,481 --> 00:08:18,770
we need to hire a whole bunch of lawyers
elsewhere.

186
00:08:18,780 --> 00:08:20,710
We what we can do or can't do it.
No,

187
00:08:20,740 --> 00:08:23,030
we're not gonna hire them.
They'll tell us we can't do.

188
00:08:23,031 --> 00:08:26,390
So we have to just go ahead and not hire
the lawyers and just just do it.

189
00:08:26,930 --> 00:08:27,250
Now,
you know,

190
00:08:27,251 --> 00:08:28,310
the sort of,
uh,

191
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:29,690
I,
I actually,

192
00:08:29,750 --> 00:08:33,380
I do not know if a company like paypal 
could have been started even two,

193
00:08:33,381 --> 00:08:34,490
three years later.
So,

194
00:08:34,491 --> 00:08:34,880
you know,
in the,

195
00:08:35,210 --> 00:08:40,210
in the aftermath of nine slash 11,
we got the Patriot Act in the US and 

196
00:08:40,210 --> 00:08:40,210
that,
uh,

197
00:08:40,310 --> 00:08:41,120
that attached,
you know,

198
00:08:41,150 --> 00:08:43,940
much more regulatory scrutiny to,
uh,

199
00:08:44,070 --> 00:08:46,100
to financial transactions,
to payments,

200
00:08:46,340 --> 00:08:48,200
the know your customer rules became 
much,

201
00:08:48,260 --> 00:08:50,090
much trickier.
And so,

202
00:08:50,091 --> 00:08:55,091
uh,
so I do think that there's a weird way 

203
00:08:55,091 --> 00:08:57,000
in which there was an opening to start a
business like paypal in 1999 slash 2000,

204
00:08:57,270 --> 00:08:58,560
even three years later.

205
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:00,330
I think it might not have been possible.
Yeah.

206
00:09:00,331 --> 00:09:05,070
And it's so cool to me just knowing a 
lot of your ideology and the libertarian

207
00:09:05,071 --> 00:09:10,071
ideas you care about and just going 
ahead and building what you want to 

208
00:09:10,071 --> 00:09:10,530
build instead of waiting for other 
people to do it.

209
00:09:10,770 --> 00:09:13,770
I mean,
you actually did it and that's a pretty.

210
00:09:13,940 --> 00:09:15,000
It's a pretty great thing.
Well,

211
00:09:15,001 --> 00:09:15,750
it was,
it was,

212
00:09:15,751 --> 00:09:17,970
um,
it was sort of the sense that,

213
00:09:17,971 --> 00:09:19,680
you know,
we were going to change the world.

214
00:09:19,681 --> 00:09:20,550
We're gonna,
you know,

215
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:22,920
give people more control over their 
money.

216
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:24,120
We had all these ideas about,
you know,

217
00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:26,630
getting rid of central banks and 
creating a new currency.

218
00:09:26,631 --> 00:09:29,520
We never quite got to the bitcoin stage 
of it.

219
00:09:29,610 --> 00:09:31,410
We'll get to that later.
But,

220
00:09:31,740 --> 00:09:32,730
but certainly,
uh,

221
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:34,190
certainly these ideas were,
you know,

222
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:36,810
were incredibly motivational and doing 
it.

223
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:40,380
And it is always a little bit of a 
contrast from,

224
00:09:40,730 --> 00:09:45,730
you know,
I always have this view on politics 

225
00:09:45,730 --> 00:09:48,771
where it's both incredibly important and
then in many ways incredibly frustrating

226
00:09:49,590 --> 00:09:51,280
because it's so,
um,

227
00:09:51,750 --> 00:09:54,720
it's like the air we breathe that 
permeates our whole system and then it's

228
00:09:54,721 --> 00:09:57,120
also so hard to,
to ever change,

229
00:09:57,160 --> 00:09:57,620
you know,
as a,

230
00:09:57,900 --> 00:09:59,700
as a college student,
I started you this,

231
00:09:59,970 --> 00:10:02,310
a conservative Libertarian newspaper in 
Stanford,

232
00:10:02,311 --> 00:10:04,560
the Stanford Review and uh,
and there was a lot,

233
00:10:04,561 --> 00:10:09,561
you know,
it's important to have debates to 

234
00:10:09,561 --> 00:10:09,561
discuss things and then it's often so 
hard to,

235
00:10:09,561 --> 00:10:11,790
to change things in the paypal hack was 
in a way,

236
00:10:12,130 --> 00:10:13,710
you know,
we were going to sign the world.

237
00:10:13,710 --> 00:10:18,710
We're going to ask for permission.
We're just tech technology over 

238
00:10:18,710 --> 00:10:18,710
politics.
Well,

239
00:10:18,710 --> 00:10:20,790
speaking of changing the world,
let's flash forward a couple of years.

240
00:10:20,791 --> 00:10:25,791
So we're just doing some business 
background first before we get to a lot 

241
00:10:25,791 --> 00:10:25,791
of your,
your ideas of the day.

242
00:10:25,791 --> 00:10:28,650
You were the first outside investor in 
facebook,

243
00:10:28,651 --> 00:10:33,651
500 grand to the Zuckerberg guy.
Did you know him well before that?

244
00:10:33,781 --> 00:10:37,080
Had you guys communicated a lot?
How did that even come to pass?

245
00:10:37,170 --> 00:10:42,170
Not really.
Was the sort of actually literally the 

246
00:10:42,170 --> 00:10:42,170
first day we met,
we talked for an hour,

247
00:10:42,170 --> 00:10:44,460
we came back and we gave him the term 
sheet about an hour later.

248
00:10:44,461 --> 00:10:45,680
So it was,
how was a,

249
00:10:45,690 --> 00:10:47,750
it was a fast decision,
uh,

250
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:52,880
I think,
I think people always have this sort of 

251
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:55,370
shark tank image of these things,
but some sort of super sophisticated 

252
00:10:55,370 --> 00:10:57,930
pitch and you say just the right things.
That's what works.

253
00:10:57,930 --> 00:10:59,640
And it was nothing of the sort and he 
was uh,

254
00:11:00,060 --> 00:11:01,020
he was a,
you know,

255
00:11:01,470 --> 00:11:06,470
kind of introverted 19 year old,
a sophomore between sophomore and junior

256
00:11:06,511 --> 00:11:07,350
year,
summer,

257
00:11:07,380 --> 00:11:09,800
summer of 2004.
And uh,

258
00:11:10,350 --> 00:11:12,630
and um,
and the,

259
00:11:12,631 --> 00:11:17,631
the main,
the main thing I had going for it was 

260
00:11:17,631 --> 00:11:20,541
just growing fast.
They were something like 20 college 

261
00:11:20,541 --> 00:11:20,541
campuses.
They had about 100,000

262
00:11:20,541 --> 00:11:25,461
people on the network and they just 
needed more money for computers because 

263
00:11:25,461 --> 00:11:29,691
there was such demand for,
for the product as they were going to 

264
00:11:29,691 --> 00:11:32,001
launch at more colleges in the fall.
So is that what appealed to you more 

265
00:11:32,001 --> 00:11:33,310
than the product itself?
Just that you saw engagement.

266
00:11:33,340 --> 00:11:35,040
It was already,
it was already working.

267
00:11:35,070 --> 00:11:35,930
Yeah.
Um,

268
00:11:36,150 --> 00:11:38,010
and then,
but I would say the other,

269
00:11:38,070 --> 00:11:41,040
the other part of it was that there was 
like a prehistory to it.

270
00:11:41,041 --> 00:11:46,041
So one of my,
one of my good friends from paypal back 

271
00:11:46,041 --> 00:11:48,810
from Stanford guy named Reid Hoffman who
started linkedin later years,

272
00:11:48,811 --> 00:11:53,811
but uh,
and he worked with me at paypal in the 

273
00:11:53,811 --> 00:11:53,811
late nineties,
early two thousands.

274
00:11:53,811 --> 00:11:57,800
But before that he had started a social 
networking company back in 1997,

275
00:11:58,090 --> 00:12:01,330
seven years before facebook.
And they had,

276
00:12:01,420 --> 00:12:02,520
they already had,
um,

277
00:12:02,740 --> 00:12:07,740
you know,
they had social net was the name of the 

278
00:12:07,740 --> 00:12:07,740
company.
So that social networking in the name of

279
00:12:07,740 --> 00:12:12,121
the company seven years before.
And there were all these things that 

280
00:12:12,121 --> 00:12:13,540
they had,
they had thought about doing.

281
00:12:13,541 --> 00:12:14,470
So it's going to be,
you know,

282
00:12:14,740 --> 00:12:19,740
it was going to be your,
as the 19 nineties version of social 

283
00:12:19,740 --> 00:12:23,101
networking was going to have these 
avatars and cyberspace and I might be a 

284
00:12:23,101 --> 00:12:24,990
cat and you might be a dog and I've been
virtual cat.

285
00:12:24,991 --> 00:12:27,580
You're a virtual dog.
And we have to figure out how we relate.

286
00:12:27,940 --> 00:12:31,900
And it turns out people aren't,
weren't really interested in that.

287
00:12:32,020 --> 00:12:35,230
They weren't really interested in some 
sort of fictional online persona.

288
00:12:35,350 --> 00:12:37,210
It was much more about real identity.

289
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:42,760
And somehow facebook was the first one 
to crack the problem of real identity 

290
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:47,020
where even though it's always a little 
bit curated,

291
00:12:47,140 --> 00:12:51,100
certainly for the most part,
people on facebook are who they say they

292
00:12:51,101 --> 00:12:54,070
are for the most part at least.
So am I mistaken,

293
00:12:54,071 --> 00:12:56,980
you're the only person who's been on the
board of facebook the entire way out,

294
00:12:56,981 --> 00:12:57,930
except for mark,
right?

295
00:12:57,931 --> 00:12:58,360
Right,
right.

296
00:12:58,361 --> 00:12:59,150
Since the beginning.
Yes.

297
00:12:59,151 --> 00:12:59,880
Yeah.
Is,

298
00:13:00,070 --> 00:13:05,070
what can I ask you about that,
that facebook won't get too angry about 

299
00:13:05,070 --> 00:13:06,310
if I asked you?
Well,

300
00:13:06,311 --> 00:13:11,311
it just.
What's the experience like of being a 

301
00:13:11,311 --> 00:13:13,270
part of a board from the beginning of 
really the thing of the Internet,

302
00:13:13,271 --> 00:13:16,690
what seems to drive conversation the 
most on the Internet?

303
00:13:16,930 --> 00:13:17,970
Well,
there's um,

304
00:13:18,700 --> 00:13:19,220
you know,
there's,

305
00:13:19,260 --> 00:13:22,330
I mean it's been sort of like this 
incredible trajectory,

306
00:13:22,331 --> 00:13:22,820
you know,
uh,

307
00:13:22,930 --> 00:13:27,930
where it's gotten probably much bigger 
than I would have thought possible at 

308
00:13:27,930 --> 00:13:27,930
the time.

309
00:13:27,930 --> 00:13:32,850
Even though I was,
I was incredibly optimistic and bullish 

310
00:13:32,850 --> 00:13:33,220
on it.
Certainly back in back in 2004,

311
00:13:33,221 --> 00:13:35,410
2005.
I think that,

312
00:13:35,411 --> 00:13:38,060
uh,
I think that one,

313
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:43,200
one kind of perspective for a lot of the
world class entrepreneurs is,

314
00:13:43,750 --> 00:13:45,730
they're not specialists.
They're,

315
00:13:45,780 --> 00:13:48,010
there's something close to poly maths.
So,

316
00:13:48,340 --> 00:13:49,080
um,
you know,

317
00:13:49,081 --> 00:13:51,580
if you have a conversation with Mark 
Zuckerberg,

318
00:13:51,790 --> 00:13:56,790
he'd be able to speak with a surprising 
amount of understanding about a lot of 

319
00:13:57,551 --> 00:14:02,551
things.
We could speak about the details of the 

320
00:14:02,551 --> 00:14:02,551
facebook product.
He could talk about,

321
00:14:02,551 --> 00:14:02,551
um,
the,

322
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:06,460
the way people think about social media,
the psychology,

323
00:14:06,900 --> 00:14:11,350
the way the culture is shifting,
the management of the company,

324
00:14:11,351 --> 00:14:13,390
his ideas on that,
his ideas on,

325
00:14:13,391 --> 00:14:18,391
um,
and then how this fits into the bigger 

326
00:14:18,391 --> 00:14:20,251
history of technology.
And so it's a sort of an academic view 

327
00:14:20,251 --> 00:14:25,080
is often that you're like sort of a 
narrow expert on one thing and that's 

328
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:28,801
what you do and what it is about.
It's much more a sort of polymath like 

329
00:14:30,380 --> 00:14:32,800
intellect to understand all these 
different things.

330
00:14:32,810 --> 00:14:37,810
And the kinds of board conversations 
we've had over the last 13,

331
00:14:38,681 --> 00:14:42,460
14 years have just been this crazy 
range.

332
00:14:42,540 --> 00:14:47,540
Yeah.
It must be particularly interesting for 

333
00:14:47,540 --> 00:14:49,861
you though,
as sort of the outsider in silicon 

334
00:14:49,861 --> 00:14:49,861
valley and we're going to talk about 
you,

335
00:14:49,861 --> 00:14:51,680
why you moved down to La,
all that stuff

336
00:14:52,550 --> 00:14:55,190
that you've been there the whole time,
that it's not,

337
00:14:55,191 --> 00:15:00,191
you know,
they didn't for all the reasons that 

338
00:15:00,191 --> 00:15:00,191
silicon valley may be what it is.
You weren't ever booted off the board or

339
00:15:00,191 --> 00:15:01,160
anything like that.
They've,

340
00:15:01,460 --> 00:15:04,260
they've let you be the contrarian guy 
there so that,

341
00:15:04,261 --> 00:15:09,261
that actually must,
that's a good thing about silicon 

342
00:15:09,261 --> 00:15:09,261
valley,
I suppose,

343
00:15:09,261 --> 00:15:10,580
or at least within the little microcosm 
that you sit in,

344
00:15:10,581 --> 00:15:10,780
right?

345
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:11,680
No,
I,

346
00:15:11,681 --> 00:15:12,430
I,
you know,

347
00:15:12,431 --> 00:15:14,670
I don't experience,
you know,

348
00:15:14,830 --> 00:15:17,740
a great deal of hostility to me 
personally know people,

349
00:15:17,741 --> 00:15:18,630
you know,
it's uh,

350
00:15:18,730 --> 00:15:20,440
it's uh,
it's just,

351
00:15:20,790 --> 00:15:21,250
uh,
you,

352
00:15:21,260 --> 00:15:22,120
you always,
uh,

353
00:15:22,750 --> 00:15:23,530
you know,
it's,

354
00:15:23,940 --> 00:15:28,940
it's,
it's sort of manifests in all sorts of 

355
00:15:28,940 --> 00:15:30,961
other ways.
So I do think Silicon Valley at this 

356
00:15:30,961 --> 00:15:32,971
point has a bit of a conformity problem.
It has a bit of a way in which people 

357
00:15:33,461 --> 00:15:34,280
are,
you know,

358
00:15:34,330 --> 00:15:37,510
too,
too much all thinking the same way.

359
00:15:37,540 --> 00:15:42,540
It's just like the apple.
I saw this meme on the Internet the 

360
00:15:42,540 --> 00:15:46,330
other day where it was sort of the 
Silicon Valley in 1997 colon.

361
00:15:46,331 --> 00:15:50,230
Think different in silicon valley.
Two thousand 18 colon think the same.

362
00:15:50,740 --> 00:15:53,050
And uh,
and so there is something that's uh,

363
00:15:53,190 --> 00:15:58,190
that's gone.
That's gone a bit wrong even though I'm 

364
00:15:58,190 --> 00:15:58,280
hard pressed to cite things where,
you know,

365
00:15:58,440 --> 00:16:00,190
it's,
it's really affected me personally.

366
00:16:00,280 --> 00:16:00,830
Yeah.
All right,

367
00:16:00,831 --> 00:16:02,950
well I was actually going to push that 
to a little bit later,

368
00:16:02,951 --> 00:16:04,450
but let's just stay with that for now 
then.

369
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:09,480
Do you remember moments,
did you see some markers along the way 

370
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:13,261
where you realized some of this group 
think was affecting the actual products?

371
00:16:14,420 --> 00:16:19,420
Where were the actual ability to create 
new technologies or new products where 

372
00:16:19,420 --> 00:16:23,971
that was actually causing stagnation?
Because I sent them,

373
00:16:24,340 --> 00:16:29,340
I sent,
there's been sort of a long road to get 

374
00:16:29,340 --> 00:16:31,081
here,
but you have sort of been talking about 

375
00:16:31,081 --> 00:16:33,691
this for awhile now and I think there's 
a direct connection to the diversity 

376
00:16:33,691 --> 00:16:36,841
myths,
which we'll also talk about what you 

377
00:16:36,841 --> 00:16:36,841
wrote 20 years ago.
Right?

378
00:16:36,841 --> 00:16:36,841
Well,
I,

379
00:16:37,260 --> 00:16:41,460
I do think Silicon Valley has shifted a 
lot over over the years.

380
00:16:41,461 --> 00:16:44,610
So when I was an undergraduate at 
Stanford in the late 19 eighties,

381
00:16:45,060 --> 00:16:48,900
Stanford was sort of a very liberal 
politically correct place.

382
00:16:49,290 --> 00:16:52,110
But these silicon valley surrounding,
uh,

383
00:16:52,170 --> 00:16:55,380
not so much.
It was vaguely libertarian.

384
00:16:55,460 --> 00:16:56,290
Uh,
you know,

385
00:16:56,300 --> 00:17:01,300
it was,
it was a moderate Republican 

386
00:17:01,300 --> 00:17:02,961
congressional district and um,
and then sort of by the late nineties I 

387
00:17:02,961 --> 00:17:04,950
would say to shifted to being sort of a 
moderate,

388
00:17:05,180 --> 00:17:06,630
um,
moderate Democrat,

389
00:17:06,660 --> 00:17:08,470
which is around the time I started 
paypal.

390
00:17:08,850 --> 00:17:10,890
Then if you fast forward another 20 
years,

391
00:17:11,070 --> 00:17:12,330
it's sort of,
it's,

392
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:14,790
it's sort of a pretty hard left.

393
00:17:14,830 --> 00:17:16,500
Yeah.
So what there,

394
00:17:17,530 --> 00:17:22,530
because it seems to me that if I was 
taking the people that I wanted to be 

395
00:17:22,530 --> 00:17:22,750
the most creative,
the most outside of the box,

396
00:17:22,751 --> 00:17:27,751
the most to look at the system and go,
how do we fix the system from the 

397
00:17:27,751 --> 00:17:30,301
outside?
You'd want a lot of libertarian 

398
00:17:30,301 --> 00:17:32,431
thinkers.
That's the way I would at least look at 

399
00:17:32,431 --> 00:17:34,591
it.
So you'd think that everyone in silicon 

400
00:17:34,591 --> 00:17:34,900
valley would be pretty libertarian.
They want to do things on their own.

401
00:17:35,170 --> 00:17:38,720
And yet somehow in those 20 years it 
became the opposite.

402
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:40,830
It's like you only ask the question to 
why

403
00:17:40,850 --> 00:17:43,280
is it,
why is it so so loved when I think these

404
00:17:43,281 --> 00:17:43,800
things are,
you know,

405
00:17:43,810 --> 00:17:45,230
they're,
they're somewhat over determined.

406
00:17:45,231 --> 00:17:48,350
So I would say a part of it is,
um,

407
00:17:48,710 --> 00:17:49,370
is,
uh,

408
00:17:49,380 --> 00:17:54,380
it's probably the most educated part of 
the country in terms of how much time 

409
00:17:54,380 --> 00:17:58,431
people spent in college.
And I think one of the downsides of too 

410
00:17:58,431 --> 00:17:59,220
much education is that you get the most 
brainwashed.

411
00:17:59,490 --> 00:18:00,180
And so it's,
it's,

412
00:18:00,181 --> 00:18:02,760
it's the most educated can also mean 
that it is,

413
00:18:02,940 --> 00:18:04,890
it is the,
it is the most brainwashed,

414
00:18:05,140 --> 00:18:06,270
uh,
you know,

415
00:18:06,510 --> 00:18:09,450
um,
this is also true of the founders,

416
00:18:09,451 --> 00:18:13,590
but certainly have many of the rank and 
file people who are,

417
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:18,600
um,
if you're sort of like a really good 

418
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:20,400
engineer or I'm really good at some 
specific thing,

419
00:18:20,970 --> 00:18:24,080
your education typically does not 
involve you thinking that much about,

420
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:29,320
about politics.
And so it's not necessarily from deep 

421
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:29,610
ideological conviction.

422
00:18:29,860 --> 00:18:32,400
It's often more as a fashion statement 
than,

423
00:18:32,401 --> 00:18:34,110
as a question of,
of power.

424
00:18:34,250 --> 00:18:34,770
So,
uh,

425
00:18:35,090 --> 00:18:40,090
so one of the things that's always a 
little bit hard to score is that even 

426
00:18:40,090 --> 00:18:40,090
though if you took a survey in silicon 
valley,

427
00:18:40,090 --> 00:18:40,500
it's,
it's,

428
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:43,650
it comes out as quite far to the left,
you know,

429
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:48,720
weirdly uniform.
We're sort of group think it's a super 

430
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:50,790
hard to know where the people really 
believe this,

431
00:18:50,970 --> 00:18:53,340
whether they're,
whether they're just going along.

432
00:18:53,650 --> 00:18:56,730
So I think it's pretty liberal,
but,

433
00:18:56,731 --> 00:19:01,731
um,
but of course not as liberal as it 

434
00:19:01,731 --> 00:19:03,591
looks.
And that's way worse because it means 

435
00:19:03,591 --> 00:19:04,260
people are too scared to,
to articulate things.

436
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:09,560
There was a,
there was a dinner I had at my house a 

437
00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:10,560
week before the 2016 election with a 
group of sort of center,

438
00:19:10,561 --> 00:19:12,570
right?
Silicon Valley people.

439
00:19:12,810 --> 00:19:17,810
One of them was a very prominent angel 
investor in Silicon Valley and he said,

440
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:21,870
I'm a,
I'm voting for trump in a week,

441
00:19:22,190 --> 00:19:24,570
but because I live in silicon valley,
I'm lying about it.

442
00:19:25,230 --> 00:19:25,940
And so,
uh,

443
00:19:26,170 --> 00:19:29,520
so are you saying this to you?
It was like 12,

444
00:19:29,660 --> 00:19:33,930
12 people up there and you're like,
I'm the guy that just the convention,

445
00:19:34,210 --> 00:19:37,170
he was honest about lying is unusual.
Is it a little bit unusual?

446
00:19:37,510 --> 00:19:39,230
And,
and the way I is,

447
00:19:39,270 --> 00:19:41,130
I tell people I'm voting for Gary 
Johnson,

448
00:19:41,220 --> 00:19:42,480
the libertarian,
so he couldn't,

449
00:19:42,481 --> 00:19:47,481
he couldn't quite get away telling 
people that it was voting for Hillary 

450
00:19:47,481 --> 00:19:48,480
Clinton because like,
your facial muscles wouldn't work.

451
00:19:48,490 --> 00:19:50,730
And your alignment so small.
I,

452
00:19:50,790 --> 00:19:52,170
Gary Johnson,
that was sort of what you,

453
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:57,440
what you could do.
And I think if you sort of looked at 

454
00:19:57,440 --> 00:19:58,920
what happened in the weeks before the 
election,

455
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:04,200
Gary Johnson support sort of collapsed.
It all went to trump and the,

456
00:20:04,201 --> 00:20:09,201
uh,
the question you have to ask is whether 

457
00:20:09,201 --> 00:20:12,930
those people just change their minds the
last minute or were they lying all along

458
00:20:13,140 --> 00:20:18,140
or were they wanting to themselves?
And so I think the sort of political 

459
00:20:18,140 --> 00:20:20,820
correctness,
it's always bad for thought,

460
00:20:21,090 --> 00:20:26,090
but it always makes things appear more 
uniform than they are even in Silicon 

461
00:20:26,090 --> 00:20:26,090
Valley.

462
00:20:26,090 --> 00:20:26,090
Yeah.
Well,

463
00:20:26,090 --> 00:20:26,440
I think,
you know,

464
00:20:26,441 --> 00:20:31,441
this,
I said I was going to vote for Gary 

465
00:20:31,441 --> 00:20:31,441
Johnson and I did vote for Gary Johnson 
and as I always say,

466
00:20:31,441 --> 00:20:33,320
I should be judged accordingly.
But here we are.

467
00:20:33,350 --> 00:20:38,350
So this is actually a perfect segue then
to the diversity myth because 20 years 

468
00:20:38,350 --> 00:20:42,461
ago you're,
you're at Stanford and you saw a lot of 

469
00:20:42,461 --> 00:20:44,870
the problems that we are talking about 
today.

470
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:47,830
Over and over again.
I told you a months ago,

471
00:20:48,130 --> 00:20:52,210
I was listening on Cspan two,
a talk you gave about the diversity myth

472
00:20:52,750 --> 00:20:53,830
and again,
it's from about,

473
00:20:53,890 --> 00:20:58,890
I think at that point it was like 18 
years ago or something and I was 

474
00:20:58,890 --> 00:20:59,800
listening to it and David walked into 
the room and he said,

475
00:20:59,801 --> 00:21:03,700
who is that talking?
Because it was all true and it was,

476
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:08,760
he thought it was somebody that he 
thought I was listening to the news of 

477
00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:11,041
today,
like somebody's laying out what's going 

478
00:21:11,041 --> 00:21:11,041
on today,
but you saw this,

479
00:21:11,041 --> 00:21:13,540
this issue with multiculturalism,
with fau diversity,

480
00:21:13,541 --> 00:21:17,740
the focus on equality of outcome,
not opportunity.

481
00:21:17,741 --> 00:21:21,490
You saw this way before seemingly anyone
did.

482
00:21:21,491 --> 00:21:22,960
How,
how did that come to be?

483
00:21:23,770 --> 00:21:24,340
Well,
it was,

484
00:21:24,341 --> 00:21:26,080
um,
there was certainly.

485
00:21:26,081 --> 00:21:29,650
I'm quite a wave of the stuff in the 
late eighties,

486
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:30,970
early nineties on,
you know,

487
00:21:31,020 --> 00:21:34,120
a number of college campuses and for a 
variety of reasons,

488
00:21:34,121 --> 00:21:35,170
um,
you know,

489
00:21:35,171 --> 00:21:36,790
a lot of it crystallized at Stanford.

490
00:21:36,790 --> 00:21:37,780
There was a,
there was this,

491
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:43,320
there was this super intense debate 
about a western culture which was both a

492
00:21:43,570 --> 00:21:48,570
freshman,
one year long freshmen sort of general 

493
00:21:48,570 --> 00:21:48,970
humanities course where you learned 
about,

494
00:21:48,971 --> 00:21:50,800
you know,
western culture history,

495
00:21:50,830 --> 00:21:54,150
Western civilization.
But then it was a course and the,

496
00:21:54,330 --> 00:21:59,330
and the research,
Jesse Jackson showed up to campus one 

497
00:21:59,330 --> 00:21:59,330
day and sort of blood this chant,
hey,

498
00:21:59,330 --> 00:21:59,630
hey,
Ho,

499
00:21:59,631 --> 00:22:01,360
Ho,
western culture has got to go.

500
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:04,870
And people were talking about both the 
course and of course,

501
00:22:05,050 --> 00:22:08,920
the whole society and culture that was 
represented by that and,

502
00:22:08,921 --> 00:22:09,610
uh,
and,

503
00:22:09,690 --> 00:22:10,040
and,
and,

504
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:15,080
and,
and so there were a lot of these 

505
00:22:15,080 --> 00:22:15,610
different debates that got a got sort of
thrown up.

506
00:22:15,611 --> 00:22:19,090
So is concerned about discriminate 
racial discrimination,

507
00:22:19,091 --> 00:22:20,580
gender discrimination,
you know,

508
00:22:20,590 --> 00:22:22,690
other kinds of people who were 
victimized.

509
00:22:22,990 --> 00:22:23,860
Uh,
and then,

510
00:22:24,100 --> 00:22:29,100
um,
and then in many cases it felt like it 

511
00:22:29,100 --> 00:22:31,891
was this incredible overreach where 
people were in some sense using their 

512
00:22:31,891 --> 00:22:35,461
victim status as a stick with which to 
beat other people up or something like 

513
00:22:35,461 --> 00:22:35,461
that.

514
00:22:35,461 --> 00:22:39,670
Or we're going to victimize the 
victimizers and it's going to be sort of

515
00:22:40,070 --> 00:22:41,320
a,
something like that.

516
00:22:41,321 --> 00:22:41,640
And,
uh,

517
00:22:41,641 --> 00:22:46,641
and so multiculturalism and political 
correctness where somehow I'm very 

518
00:22:47,190 --> 00:22:52,190
linked.
The multiculturalism part was we're 

519
00:22:52,190 --> 00:22:53,880
gonna give special privileges.
Um,

520
00:22:54,020 --> 00:22:56,340
you know,
to disadvantaged people are in,

521
00:22:56,350 --> 00:23:01,350
some are correct.
These injustices of the past and the 

522
00:23:01,350 --> 00:23:04,351
politically,
the intolerant politically correct part 

523
00:23:04,351 --> 00:23:07,470
was we were going to go after their 
oppressors whether they were real or 

524
00:23:07,470 --> 00:23:07,930
imagined.
And,

525
00:23:07,931 --> 00:23:09,730
uh,
and in many ways it felt like,

526
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:11,770
you know,
incredible overreach.

527
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:13,110
You ended up with,
uh,

528
00:23:13,330 --> 00:23:16,120
with these draconian speech codes on 
campus,

529
00:23:16,420 --> 00:23:17,690
um,
and,

530
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:22,720
and with,
with sort of the humanities in a sense 

531
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:23,420
effectively got gutted in the late 
eighties at Stanford though,

532
00:23:23,421 --> 00:23:25,570
of course,
it took many years for that to,

533
00:23:25,590 --> 00:23:26,770
to,
to fully play out.

534
00:23:27,040 --> 00:23:27,670
But,
uh,

535
00:23:28,030 --> 00:23:33,030
and then of course,
one of the buzzwords then as now was 

536
00:23:33,030 --> 00:23:33,030
diversity,
which,

537
00:23:33,030 --> 00:23:34,330
um,
which,

538
00:23:34,390 --> 00:23:35,590
uh,
and,

539
00:23:36,220 --> 00:23:37,060
and you know,
I think,

540
00:23:37,150 --> 00:23:38,680
I think diversity is a good thing.

541
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:39,500
I think especially,
you know,

542
00:23:39,501 --> 00:23:41,600
diversity of ideas is,
is,

543
00:23:41,601 --> 00:23:43,000
is,
is to be valued,

544
00:23:43,210 --> 00:23:48,210
but you don't have real diversity.
You just have a group of people who 

545
00:23:48,210 --> 00:23:50,360
looked different and uh,
and think alike.

546
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:51,050
And so it's,
it's,

547
00:23:51,051 --> 00:23:53,680
it has to meet,
it has to be more than just a,

548
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:54,410
you know,
then just,

549
00:23:54,411 --> 00:23:56,630
um,
having the extras from the space cantina

550
00:23:56,631 --> 00:23:58,910
scene worse or something like that.
Right.

551
00:23:58,970 --> 00:23:59,490
And,
uh,

552
00:23:59,530 --> 00:24:01,280
and that's.
And so that's always,

553
00:24:01,490 --> 00:24:06,490
that's always.
So it's always like an internal 

554
00:24:06,490 --> 00:24:07,931
critique.
The diversity method is that it's not 

555
00:24:07,931 --> 00:24:07,931
about diversity at all.
It's about,

556
00:24:07,931 --> 00:24:12,700
it's about conformity.
Was that the first time that you had 

557
00:24:12,700 --> 00:24:14,870
really staked out what is seemingly an 
unpopular position?

558
00:24:14,871 --> 00:24:18,210
Although I think actually,
especially in 2018 is,

559
00:24:18,280 --> 00:24:21,510
is quite a popular position,
even if it's thought of as,

560
00:24:21,511 --> 00:24:24,260
as out there was that the first time you
would publicly,

561
00:24:24,261 --> 00:24:29,261
because nobody wants to be the guy that 
says this stuff and then immediately is 

562
00:24:29,261 --> 00:24:29,940
going to be called a racist and a bigot 
and a homophobia.

563
00:24:29,940 --> 00:24:34,940
All those things.
Had you ever done anything like that 

564
00:24:34,940 --> 00:24:34,940
before?
You know,

565
00:24:34,940 --> 00:24:35,420
it's,
it's uh,

566
00:24:36,620 --> 00:24:37,850
you know,
I probably,

567
00:24:37,851 --> 00:24:38,540
you know,
and it's,

568
00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:42,860
it's hard to know how far to go back in 
the autobiographical history or how good

569
00:24:43,430 --> 00:24:44,110
I am at this,
but,

570
00:24:44,550 --> 00:24:46,370
but probably already in a junior high 
school,

571
00:24:46,371 --> 00:24:47,540
high school,
I would,

572
00:24:47,970 --> 00:24:48,890
I would,
um,

573
00:24:49,510 --> 00:24:54,510
you know,
I would take the positions that I 

574
00:24:54,510 --> 00:24:55,961
believed in and they wouldn't,
they wouldn't necessarily be the 

575
00:24:55,961 --> 00:24:56,420
majority of positions.
And so it was,

576
00:24:56,500 --> 00:24:57,150
you know,
it,

577
00:24:57,740 --> 00:25:02,740
you know,
in junior high school I was totally 

578
00:25:02,740 --> 00:25:05,660
against struggle legalization of any 
sort and that was a minority.

579
00:25:05,900 --> 00:25:09,920
That was a minority view or A.
I supported Reagan in 1980.

580
00:25:09,940 --> 00:25:11,250
And,
you know,

581
00:25:11,470 --> 00:25:16,470
we were sort of in a relatively liberal 
area and that was against sort of a 

582
00:25:16,470 --> 00:25:16,470
minority view.
So,

583
00:25:16,470 --> 00:25:20,480
so I think I would have had a w,
I wouldn't say like extreme outlier 

584
00:25:20,481 --> 00:25:21,320
positions,
but,

585
00:25:21,321 --> 00:25:22,190
uh,
but I,

586
00:25:22,191 --> 00:25:27,191
I've,
I've always thought that it was 

587
00:25:27,191 --> 00:25:27,191
important to think for yourself.

588
00:25:27,191 --> 00:25:28,940
So when you wrote the book and then 
started talking about these issues,

589
00:25:28,941 --> 00:25:33,941
what kind of pushback did you get?
Because that I think is the core issue 

590
00:25:33,941 --> 00:25:36,320
that most of my viewers are identifying 
with these days,

591
00:25:36,321 --> 00:25:38,420
that they're taking positions that are 
true,

592
00:25:38,421 --> 00:25:41,390
that don't mean that they're racist or 
bigots or homophobes,

593
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:46,720
but that they mean they care about more 
about diversity of ideas then diversity 

594
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:46,910
of skin color or those things.
And,

595
00:25:47,100 --> 00:25:52,100
and they're scared to say those ideas.
And yet you were doing it a long time 

596
00:25:52,100 --> 00:25:52,880
ago.
Well,

597
00:25:52,881 --> 00:25:53,840
it's,
uh,

598
00:25:54,340 --> 00:25:55,160
it's,
it's always,

599
00:25:55,161 --> 00:25:57,230
uh,
it's always a very tricky thing.

600
00:25:57,231 --> 00:25:57,830
So it's,
it's,

601
00:25:58,100 --> 00:25:58,810
it's,
um,

602
00:25:59,210 --> 00:26:04,210
on some level,
I'm on some level the way we've just 

603
00:26:04,210 --> 00:26:05,780
been talking about it,
there aren't that many people who will,

604
00:26:06,140 --> 00:26:07,640
who will go out of their way to disagree
with us.

605
00:26:07,650 --> 00:26:09,170
So people know you,
you don't want people.

606
00:26:09,290 --> 00:26:10,070
I mean,
there's some people,

607
00:26:10,071 --> 00:26:12,950
but most people would say find out.
No we don't,

608
00:26:13,270 --> 00:26:15,440
we,
we don't want any different views are,

609
00:26:15,460 --> 00:26:16,670
you know,
we need to suppress views.

610
00:26:16,671 --> 00:26:17,990
People.
Some people say that,

611
00:26:17,991 --> 00:26:19,460
but not,
not really that many.

612
00:26:19,700 --> 00:26:21,110
Well,
they mask it in other ways,

613
00:26:21,111 --> 00:26:22,870
right?
No one's going to outright say then.

614
00:26:22,940 --> 00:26:25,490
But then in practice you end up with 
this,

615
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:26,330
uh,
with this,

616
00:26:26,390 --> 00:26:28,280
uh,
with this incredible conformity,

617
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:30,320
even though that's not in theory with 
people.

618
00:26:30,470 --> 00:26:32,810
Would people want.
One of the,

619
00:26:33,170 --> 00:26:37,220
one of the professors I studied under 
stanford is Rene Girard,

620
00:26:37,221 --> 00:26:42,221
is for a cultural critic.
Philosopher a literary theorist is 

621
00:26:42,530 --> 00:26:47,530
really brilliant guy.
And he sort of always had this theory 

622
00:26:47,530 --> 00:26:48,510
that people imitate each other.
They copy each other,

623
00:26:48,511 --> 00:26:53,511
they're sort of,
they're much more prone to fashion and 

624
00:26:53,511 --> 00:26:53,511
things like this.
And uh,

625
00:26:53,730 --> 00:26:55,320
one of them he was,
he was from France.

626
00:26:55,570 --> 00:26:58,800
And so one of the,
one of the metaphors he had for a lot of

627
00:26:58,801 --> 00:27:03,801
the sort of more politically correct 
professors at Stanford was that they all

628
00:27:04,681 --> 00:27:06,780
thought they were in the French 
resistance,

629
00:27:06,980 --> 00:27:09,660
but,
but if they had lived in vichy France,

630
00:27:09,661 --> 00:27:12,380
they would have all been collaborators 
and um,

631
00:27:12,500 --> 00:27:13,580
and,
and so the,

632
00:27:13,581 --> 00:27:18,581
the,
the self understanding people have is 

633
00:27:18,581 --> 00:27:20,931
that they're super courageous,
independent thinkers and that's why they

634
00:27:22,040 --> 00:27:24,900
[inaudible] that they would have been in
the resistance in France.

635
00:27:25,140 --> 00:27:30,140
But then in reality,
if you ask them what the views are that 

636
00:27:30,140 --> 00:27:33,591
they have,
it's the same as everybody else around 

637
00:27:33,591 --> 00:27:33,591
them.
Yeah.

638
00:27:33,591 --> 00:27:33,591
Well,
that.

639
00:27:33,591 --> 00:27:34,620
And you have to always ask if everyone 
has the same views.

640
00:27:34,770 --> 00:27:39,770
It can mean one of two things.
It can mean that you've reached the 

641
00:27:39,770 --> 00:27:40,740
absolute truth or it can mean that,
uh,

642
00:27:40,830 --> 00:27:45,830
that you have a,
you have this sort of incredible 

643
00:27:45,830 --> 00:27:45,830
conformity.
Yeah.

644
00:27:45,830 --> 00:27:45,830
Well,
it's so interesting

645
00:27:45,830 --> 00:27:50,270
because he was talking about the 
resistance in France and now we have a 

646
00:27:50,270 --> 00:27:51,270
group of people in America that think 
that they're part of the resistance.

647
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:53,850
And I suspect that if they were in 
power,

648
00:27:54,180 --> 00:27:59,180
they would be treating the people who 
were the resistance of them much worse 

649
00:27:59,180 --> 00:28:00,270
than they're being treated.
Right.

650
00:28:00,420 --> 00:28:00,720
Well,
I,

651
00:28:00,721 --> 00:28:01,330
I,
I,

652
00:28:01,420 --> 00:28:06,420
I've thought that the,
the reward critique could also apply to 

653
00:28:06,420 --> 00:28:06,420
them that,
uh,

654
00:28:06,420 --> 00:28:06,420
that,
uh,

655
00:28:06,870 --> 00:28:11,870
you know,
by identifying yourself as part of some 

656
00:28:11,870 --> 00:28:15,440
mob like resistance movement,
you're suggesting the exact opposite.

657
00:28:16,170 --> 00:28:16,960
That,
uh,

658
00:28:17,210 --> 00:28:19,410
you know,
it counts,

659
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:20,550
you know,
political views,

660
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:22,260
you know,
I respect,

661
00:28:22,740 --> 00:28:23,900
uh,
you know,

662
00:28:24,270 --> 00:28:29,270
I think there are people can have 
sincere views even if they're in the 

663
00:28:29,270 --> 00:28:29,270
overwhelming majority,
but it's,

664
00:28:29,270 --> 00:28:31,230
it's impressive if you're in the 
minority.

665
00:28:31,380 --> 00:28:34,920
So if you're,
if you're speaking out against president

666
00:28:34,921 --> 00:28:39,921
trump in your small town in Alabama,
I tend to think that if you're,

667
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:44,730
if you're in,
if you're in San Francisco or Manhattan,

668
00:28:45,130 --> 00:28:46,610
um,
and uh,

669
00:28:46,920 --> 00:28:48,750
and you're,
you're part of the resistance,

670
00:28:49,290 --> 00:28:51,280
I suspect something very different is 
going on.

671
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:56,440
That's really interesting to me.
Like a different way of getting at this 

672
00:28:56,440 --> 00:28:56,900
is a,
you know,

673
00:28:56,920 --> 00:28:59,910
in a democracy,
we always think the majority is right.

674
00:28:59,970 --> 00:29:01,610
So it's 51,
49,

675
00:29:01,630 --> 00:29:02,790
51 probably,
right.

676
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:04,620
If it's a big majority,
it's even more,

677
00:29:04,621 --> 00:29:07,410
right,
so 70 slash 30 even even more,

678
00:29:07,411 --> 00:29:09,810
right?
But if it's 100 to zero,

679
00:29:09,870 --> 00:29:13,870
99 to one,
that's uh,

680
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:16,710
that's where we start to suspect that 
we're not a democracy,

681
00:29:16,711 --> 00:29:21,711
but we're in North Korea or that 
something's gone wrong with them voting 

682
00:29:21,711 --> 00:29:24,801
machine or something like this.
And so when we have these sort of 

683
00:29:24,801 --> 00:29:27,870
hothouse environments at places like 
Stanford or,

684
00:29:27,871 --> 00:29:32,871
uh,
or silicon valley where you have this 

685
00:29:32,871 --> 00:29:36,390
complete uniformity of thought,
the thing you have to suspect,

686
00:29:36,391 --> 00:29:39,030
this is not the wisdom of crowds.
It's not that everyone's figured out the

687
00:29:39,031 --> 00:29:40,980
truth,
it's a madness of crowds.

688
00:29:41,140 --> 00:29:44,080
It some psychosocial insanity.
Yeah.

689
00:29:44,081 --> 00:29:47,500
And this seems to be directly linked to 
what's going on on our campuses today,

690
00:29:47,501 --> 00:29:48,010
right?
I mean,

691
00:29:48,011 --> 00:29:53,011
if,
if 20 years ago you had been thinking 

692
00:29:53,011 --> 00:29:55,051
these things,
do you think your prediction would have 

693
00:29:55,051 --> 00:29:55,051
been,
oh,

694
00:29:55,051 --> 00:29:55,800
we'll be able to break these ideas 
enough so that the,

695
00:29:56,190 --> 00:30:01,190
the class of teachers and professors may
not be so addicted to it seems to have 

696
00:30:02,170 --> 00:30:06,250
come back with a vengeance on oncology 
or even even,

697
00:30:06,460 --> 00:30:07,840
you know,
radicalized further.

698
00:30:08,260 --> 00:30:08,800
But,
uh,

699
00:30:08,830 --> 00:30:09,350
but again,
it,

700
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:10,870
it,
it's uh,

701
00:30:11,140 --> 00:30:12,130
you know,
this is sort of like,

702
00:30:12,131 --> 00:30:12,450
it's,
it's a,

703
00:30:12,570 --> 00:30:13,570
it's a subtle,
you know,

704
00:30:13,580 --> 00:30:17,050
you don't want always psychologize 
people you disagree with,

705
00:30:17,051 --> 00:30:22,051
but the,
the question when you look at what's 

706
00:30:22,051 --> 00:30:23,020
happening on campuses or in various 
places is always,

707
00:30:23,230 --> 00:30:25,900
is this really what people think or is 
it just,

708
00:30:26,020 --> 00:30:27,040
are they just under,
you know,

709
00:30:27,041 --> 00:30:29,070
incredible peer pressure to fit in?
Yeah.

710
00:30:29,080 --> 00:30:34,080
Do you see that as a bizarre direct 
connection to the way many other 

711
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:37,240
institutions seem to be crumbling now?
The way people don't trust the media the

712
00:30:37,241 --> 00:30:40,420
way they used to,
the way that we're just seeing sort of a

713
00:30:40,421 --> 00:30:41,020
new,
you know,

714
00:30:41,021 --> 00:30:46,021
alon on Rogan last week.
You're sitting here today the way that 

715
00:30:46,021 --> 00:30:49,291
people want different conversations.
We're going to sit here for as long as 

716
00:30:49,291 --> 00:30:50,170
it takes to do all the people can see 
through it.

717
00:30:50,560 --> 00:30:52,150
They can,
they can see through,

718
00:30:52,630 --> 00:30:54,880
um,
the manufactured consent.

719
00:30:54,881 --> 00:30:56,350
They can see,
they can,

720
00:30:56,710 --> 00:30:57,250
you know,
it's,

721
00:30:57,270 --> 00:30:59,530
it's,
if you have conformity and it,

722
00:30:59,880 --> 00:31:02,050
and it looks real,
that's powerful.

723
00:31:02,051 --> 00:31:04,840
If it,
if it's conformity and people sense that

724
00:31:04,841 --> 00:31:06,310
it's forced,
that's,

725
00:31:06,311 --> 00:31:07,840
that's a lot shakier.
And so there's,

726
00:31:08,050 --> 00:31:09,340
it's sort of like,
I don't know,

727
00:31:09,341 --> 00:31:10,960
it's like the,
I'm not sure what the right metaphor is,

728
00:31:10,961 --> 00:31:15,961
but it's like maybe,
maybe it's like the wizard of Oz where 

729
00:31:15,961 --> 00:31:19,291
you have the man behind the curtain and 
we're looking at the man behind the 

730
00:31:19,291 --> 00:31:22,291
curtain on the Internet and uh,
and that it doesn't quite work and you 

731
00:31:22,291 --> 00:31:22,291
know,
our,

732
00:31:22,291 --> 00:31:24,310
I think our sort of media political 
machine,

733
00:31:24,610 --> 00:31:29,610
maybe it,
maybe it always worked when people 

734
00:31:29,610 --> 00:31:31,261
didn't understand how it works.
And so if you sort of see what's going 

735
00:31:31,261 --> 00:31:31,930
on in sausage making factory,
you know,

736
00:31:32,350 --> 00:31:34,210
you might not want to eat as much 
sausage anymore.

737
00:31:34,300 --> 00:31:34,870
Yeah.
All right,

738
00:31:34,871 --> 00:31:37,750
well this is clearly going to be a theme
to almost everything else we talk about.

739
00:31:37,751 --> 00:31:42,751
So let's,
let's sort of catch up to where you are 

740
00:31:42,751 --> 00:31:42,751
today and then we're going to go back to
some of that stuff.

741
00:31:42,751 --> 00:31:44,350
Tell me a little bit about pallet here.
Well,

742
00:31:44,351 --> 00:31:46,510
this was a,
this was another company I started,

743
00:31:46,530 --> 00:31:47,060
uh,
in,

744
00:31:47,080 --> 00:31:48,880
uh,
in 2004.

745
00:31:49,380 --> 00:31:50,320
Uh,
it was,

746
00:31:50,330 --> 00:31:52,450
um,
sort of the big picture,

747
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:56,080
the big picture of pay pal was sort of 
revolutionized money and payments,

748
00:31:56,560 --> 00:32:01,560
the big picture for pound Chins,
sort of like in the wake of nine slash 

749
00:32:01,560 --> 00:32:06,181
11,
a few years after that was could one do 

750
00:32:06,181 --> 00:32:10,801
something from a libertarian or civil 
liberties point of view that would still

751
00:32:11,651 --> 00:32:14,900
be tough on terrorism and uh,
and,

752
00:32:14,920 --> 00:32:16,960
and things like this.
And um,

753
00:32:17,500 --> 00:32:22,500
and the,
the sort of a sort of sense I had was 

754
00:32:22,500 --> 00:32:22,500
that,
uh,

755
00:32:22,500 --> 00:32:24,640
that uh,
the way we were going with just,

756
00:32:24,641 --> 00:32:29,641
you know,
ridiculous airport security checks and 

757
00:32:29,641 --> 00:32:31,660
super intrusive surveillance all the 
time.

758
00:32:31,870 --> 00:32:36,870
It wasn't really making us safer.
So this was sort of your answer to the 

759
00:32:36,870 --> 00:32:38,220
Patriot Act in a way.
In a way this was sort of like,

760
00:32:38,221 --> 00:32:40,220
I know you,
you had the ridiculous

761
00:32:40,220 --> 00:32:44,270
lines at airports.
He'd been through all the ways that,

762
00:32:44,271 --> 00:32:44,840
uh,
you know,

763
00:32:44,841 --> 00:32:46,250
the response,
um,

764
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:47,120
and,
uh,

765
00:32:47,121 --> 00:32:48,320
and it was,
and there was a question,

766
00:32:48,321 --> 00:32:51,470
was there some way,
was there some technological fix?

767
00:32:51,471 --> 00:32:51,760
And,
you know,

768
00:32:51,770 --> 00:32:55,880
one of the ways I often think of 
technology is that it's a way to do more

769
00:32:55,881 --> 00:32:58,730
with less and um,
and so,

770
00:32:58,731 --> 00:32:59,300
you know,
you can,

771
00:32:59,380 --> 00:33:00,590
um,
you can get,

772
00:33:00,620 --> 00:33:01,550
um,
you know,

773
00:33:01,551 --> 00:33:06,551
you can get more energy for less money.
That's like an energy innovation or 

774
00:33:06,551 --> 00:33:10,120
cleaner energy for less pollution,
um,

775
00:33:10,580 --> 00:33:15,580
more energy that pollutes less.
That would be like a technical or 

776
00:33:15,580 --> 00:33:16,850
technology innovation and clean energy.
And in the security space,

777
00:33:16,851 --> 00:33:19,340
the doing more with less is something 
like,

778
00:33:19,730 --> 00:33:24,730
um,
is something like more security with 

779
00:33:24,730 --> 00:33:25,850
less intrusion on people's civil 
liberties.

780
00:33:25,940 --> 00:33:30,940
And that's kind of the,
that's kind of the tradeoff that you 

781
00:33:30,940 --> 00:33:34,391
want.
And that the non non-technological 

782
00:33:34,391 --> 00:33:37,301
debate that we had in the U,
s and 2004 in any ways that we still 

783
00:33:37,301 --> 00:33:39,320
have in 2018 is,
is always,

784
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:40,640
uh,
it's always,

785
00:33:40,850 --> 00:33:43,540
you do more with more versus less with 
less.

786
00:33:43,540 --> 00:33:45,710
And so you can have the,
um,

787
00:33:45,980 --> 00:33:49,820
the neo-con I'm Cheney version,
let's say,

788
00:33:49,821 --> 00:33:52,140
would be that we're going to have,
you know,

789
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:56,870
we're going to have more security with 
more civil liberties violations.

790
00:33:57,200 --> 00:33:59,720
And then you can sort of say that they 
equally,

791
00:33:59,721 --> 00:34:04,721
luddite a clu would say something like,
we're going to have fewer civil 

792
00:34:06,681 --> 00:34:08,930
liberties violations and we're going to 
have less security.

793
00:34:09,390 --> 00:34:10,220
And,
um,

794
00:34:10,490 --> 00:34:15,290
and that's kind of the way the 
ideological debate gets framed.

795
00:34:15,380 --> 00:34:18,260
Now I am sympathetic to the Hclu on 
civil liberties,

796
00:34:18,670 --> 00:34:21,350
but I think they will always lose that 
debate because,

797
00:34:21,351 --> 00:34:26,351
uh,
the way you preserve civil liberties is 

798
00:34:26,351 --> 00:34:26,351
not to have terrorist attacks because 
when you get a terrorist attack,

799
00:34:26,351 --> 00:34:28,750
you get the Patriot Act.
And you know,

800
00:34:28,870 --> 00:34:33,870
if the World Trade Center would erode 
civil liberties as much as it did in 

801
00:34:33,870 --> 00:34:38,141
2001,
I didn't even want to think what would 

802
00:34:38,141 --> 00:34:38,141
happen if you had another terrorist 
attack.

803
00:34:38,141 --> 00:34:39,810
And so you have to prevent it to,
uh,

804
00:34:39,860 --> 00:34:41,600
to stop,
to stop erosion.

805
00:34:41,870 --> 00:34:44,610
What pound here does is,
uh,

806
00:34:45,080 --> 00:34:45,890
is,
um,

807
00:34:46,140 --> 00:34:46,630
it,
it,

808
00:34:46,770 --> 00:34:49,010
it sort of is a way for,
um,

809
00:34:49,850 --> 00:34:50,600
for,
uh,

810
00:34:51,470 --> 00:34:56,470
for know patterns and data to be 
visualized through a combination of 

811
00:34:56,841 --> 00:34:59,540
computers and human analysts.
And,

812
00:34:59,570 --> 00:35:00,950
um,
and then,

813
00:35:00,951 --> 00:35:05,951
um,
and then in a way that doesn't simply 

814
00:35:05,951 --> 00:35:07,310
scour the planet and get all the 
information that everybody.

815
00:35:07,311 --> 00:35:12,311
So it's just if there's something 
suspicious then you look some more and 

816
00:35:12,311 --> 00:35:15,950
so there's sort of a,
there's a natural product you build 

817
00:35:15,950 --> 00:35:17,300
before you investigate people and in 
that sense it's,

818
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:22,440
it's way less intrusive.
Is this a tough position to hold just 

819
00:35:22,440 --> 00:35:24,680
because people theme all too eager to 
give up their civil liberties.

820
00:35:24,681 --> 00:35:29,681
Like we always want easy answers.
So that's why I think the Patriot Act 

821
00:35:29,681 --> 00:35:30,830
passed with two dissenting votes,
if I'm not mistaken,

822
00:35:31,190 --> 00:35:35,030
that people don't really react so 
emotionally all the time.

823
00:35:35,330 --> 00:35:37,350
And especially after a time like 
September 11th,

824
00:35:37,351 --> 00:35:38,130
we were really,

825
00:35:38,180 --> 00:35:43,180
I think out of whack individually and 
collectively that you can come in with a

826
00:35:43,620 --> 00:35:46,680
more sane answer and say,
I understand civil liberties and I don't

827
00:35:46,681 --> 00:35:51,681
want big government,
but I want us all to be safe and that 

828
00:35:51,681 --> 00:35:53,640
that's almost doesn't ring for people 
because they just want the easy answer.

829
00:35:53,641 --> 00:35:55,560
They want the bumper sticker answer.
Yes,

830
00:35:56,730 --> 00:35:57,080
yes.
I,

831
00:35:57,081 --> 00:35:59,760
I think it's,
it's not the easiest sell,

832
00:36:00,030 --> 00:36:01,510
but uh,
but I,

833
00:36:01,540 --> 00:36:06,540
I think there is certainly a lot more 
awareness today about how much civil 

834
00:36:06,540 --> 00:36:07,590
rights have been eroded.
You know,

835
00:36:07,770 --> 00:36:11,220
how we're living in a surveillance state
all the time and how,

836
00:36:11,470 --> 00:36:13,640
you know,
deeply uncomfortable that is on,

837
00:36:13,670 --> 00:36:14,820
on,
on so many levels.

838
00:36:15,180 --> 00:36:16,590
I think that,
uh,

839
00:36:16,950 --> 00:36:18,930
I think that uh,
the way,

840
00:36:18,931 --> 00:36:20,070
um,
you know,

841
00:36:20,071 --> 00:36:23,070
I think certainly if it worked,
if the,

842
00:36:23,250 --> 00:36:27,750
if the luddite heavy handed approaches 
actually worked,

843
00:36:29,060 --> 00:36:34,060
then I think people,
people would be more tolerant and then 

844
00:36:34,060 --> 00:36:34,830
there's sort of a sense that they,
they don't even,

845
00:36:35,050 --> 00:36:35,880
they don't even work.

846
00:36:36,120 --> 00:36:41,120
Is it hard to define what work even 
means because something could say work 

847
00:36:41,120 --> 00:36:44,631
for three years,
make sure everybody's safe even if it's 

848
00:36:44,631 --> 00:36:45,030
violating all sorts of personal privacy 
and all that.

849
00:36:45,031 --> 00:36:46,380
But then if there's an attack then you 
go,

850
00:36:46,381 --> 00:36:51,381
well it doesn't work,
but what work means you prevent 

851
00:36:51,381 --> 00:36:51,381
terrorist attacks from happening in the,
in the narrow,

852
00:36:51,381 --> 00:36:52,520
narrow.
So it's just about the,

853
00:36:52,521 --> 00:36:55,560
the window that it works basically 
because the second it doesn't work,

854
00:36:55,561 --> 00:36:58,080
it doesn't work and well it's,
it's a,

855
00:36:58,340 --> 00:37:03,340
it's a,
it's how many you prevent that would 

856
00:37:03,340 --> 00:37:03,340
have otherwise happened.
Yeah.

857
00:37:03,340 --> 00:37:03,340
So I mean it's,
it's,

858
00:37:03,340 --> 00:37:05,340
it.
Maybe if it works perfectly friend,

859
00:37:05,360 --> 00:37:07,800
all of them,
if it works pretty well,

860
00:37:07,801 --> 00:37:09,690
prevents most,
something like that.

861
00:37:09,870 --> 00:37:14,870
So this must be a little bit of a tricky
situation for you because you obviously 

862
00:37:14,870 --> 00:37:15,750
have to work with the government on some
of this stuff.

863
00:37:15,750 --> 00:37:20,750
Right?
And I'm sure that that's probably not 

864
00:37:20,750 --> 00:37:20,750
thrilling for you at some level.
Well,

865
00:37:20,750 --> 00:37:20,750
I,
look,

866
00:37:20,750 --> 00:37:21,210
I,
I,

867
00:37:21,570 --> 00:37:22,770
I believe that,
uh,

868
00:37:23,070 --> 00:37:24,270
I believe that,
uh,

869
00:37:25,010 --> 00:37:26,640
uh,
it's,

870
00:37:27,430 --> 00:37:28,220
you know,
I,

871
00:37:28,230 --> 00:37:31,430
I believe you can be both a libertarian 
and uh,

872
00:37:31,510 --> 00:37:36,510
and,
and work with the government or even 

873
00:37:36,510 --> 00:37:37,170
work for the government or work in the 
government,

874
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:38,660
uh,
and uh,

875
00:37:39,180 --> 00:37:41,370
and even,
even if you believe that there should be

876
00:37:41,371 --> 00:37:43,860
a much smaller,
much less intrusive government,

877
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:47,190
you can still try to work to make it 
function better.

878
00:37:47,420 --> 00:37:50,070
And so there's both an outside and 
inside game.

879
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:55,160
Yeah.
Know there's all these versions like 

880
00:37:55,160 --> 00:37:55,160
this.
So it's like if you're a libertarian,

881
00:37:55,160 --> 00:37:57,180
should you refuse to take a social 
security check and a,

882
00:37:57,240 --> 00:38:00,390
well you can be against social security 
and still personally collect a check.

883
00:38:00,600 --> 00:38:03,020
I'm pretty sure I ran to security.
If you're,

884
00:38:03,021 --> 00:38:04,440
you know,
if you're a libertarian,

885
00:38:04,680 --> 00:38:08,240
should you refuse to be a public school 
teacher because you're a,

886
00:38:08,360 --> 00:38:09,450
the government,
well maybe,

887
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:14,720
maybe it's actually better to be a 
public school teacher rather than some 

888
00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:15,180
socialist,
a person who will otherwise get it up by

889
00:38:15,181 --> 00:38:15,630
default.

890
00:38:15,630 --> 00:38:16,340
So,
so I,

891
00:38:16,420 --> 00:38:17,070
I think,
uh,

892
00:38:17,370 --> 00:38:18,060
I think,
uh,

893
00:38:18,061 --> 00:38:23,061
I think we can,
we can have certain kinds of principles 

894
00:38:23,061 --> 00:38:23,640
and then,
and then act and pragmatic ways and this

895
00:38:23,641 --> 00:38:26,160
isn't necessarily hypocrisy.
You once said to me,

896
00:38:26,161 --> 00:38:27,780
and I'm sure you've said it to other 
people,

897
00:38:27,781 --> 00:38:29,970
that I wouldn't be a libertarian if it 
worked.

898
00:38:30,840 --> 00:38:35,840
Do you sort of picture a moment or do 
you remember a moment where you think 

899
00:38:35,840 --> 00:38:37,720
it,
I guess basically big government stopped

900
00:38:37,721 --> 00:38:40,390
working because it didn't work for 
awhile,

901
00:38:40,420 --> 00:38:41,290
basically,
right?

902
00:38:41,291 --> 00:38:42,640
Not,
not in our lifetimes,

903
00:38:42,700 --> 00:38:46,090
not are not very well in our lifetimes.
I would say,

904
00:38:46,091 --> 00:38:46,990
uh,
it's,

905
00:38:47,050 --> 00:38:48,840
it's easier to see with,
uh,

906
00:38:48,900 --> 00:38:50,500
with,
with the benefit of hindsight.

907
00:38:50,501 --> 00:38:51,420
But I think,
uh,

908
00:38:51,810 --> 00:38:53,080
yeah,
I used to think,

909
00:38:53,081 --> 00:38:53,430
you know,
when I,

910
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:56,050
when I was in college in the 19 
eighties,

911
00:38:56,051 --> 00:39:00,190
I used to think that libertarianism was 
a timeless and eternal thing.

912
00:39:00,190 --> 00:39:02,860
It was just these absolute truths for 
all time,

913
00:39:03,160 --> 00:39:06,120
all places in all times.
And I've,

914
00:39:06,270 --> 00:39:08,770
I've now come to think that it's,
it can be sort of,

915
00:39:08,820 --> 00:39:11,950
there are certain contexts where it's 
more true or less true.

916
00:39:12,370 --> 00:39:17,370
And so if you have,
if you have incredibly well functioning 

917
00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:23,640
government,
political institutions are sort of less 

918
00:39:23,640 --> 00:39:27,361
of a need for libertarianism in the 19 
fifties or 19 sixties when a state of 

919
00:39:28,151 --> 00:39:31,570
California had first rate public schools
across the board.

920
00:39:31,790 --> 00:39:32,950
Um,
and if you said,

921
00:39:32,951 --> 00:39:37,951
well,
the government can't do anything in the 

922
00:39:37,951 --> 00:39:37,951
public,
schools can't work.

923
00:39:37,951 --> 00:39:41,680
It might have been problems with them,
but that argument has gotten a lot less 

924
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:43,780
traction than it would today in 2018.
Right.

925
00:39:43,781 --> 00:39:46,030
Because you would be the utopian person 
at that point,

926
00:39:46,031 --> 00:39:46,540
right?
Yeah.

927
00:39:46,541 --> 00:39:47,700
Or You'd be,
you'd be,

928
00:39:48,160 --> 00:39:50,320
you'd be too pessimistic because 
obviously things,

929
00:39:50,500 --> 00:39:51,660
things,
things weren't that,

930
00:39:51,720 --> 00:39:52,840
of course your theory on that.

931
00:39:53,190 --> 00:39:54,580
And,
and certainly,

932
00:39:54,581 --> 00:39:57,080
um,
or in the military context we had a,

933
00:39:57,610 --> 00:39:58,510
we had the,
uh,

934
00:39:59,010 --> 00:39:59,650
the,
um,

935
00:40:00,580 --> 00:40:02,800
the atom bomb,
we had the Manhattan project,

936
00:40:02,801 --> 00:40:07,720
we had the Apollo space program in the 
19 sixties where you've got a man on the

937
00:40:07,721 --> 00:40:12,721
moon.
So if you said government can't do 

938
00:40:12,721 --> 00:40:12,721
anything that,
uh,

939
00:40:12,721 --> 00:40:13,510
that,
that felt somewhat wrong.

940
00:40:13,710 --> 00:40:17,050
Now I now I think,
I think the thing if we were on us,

941
00:40:17,051 --> 00:40:18,590
and this is always the,
you know,

942
00:40:19,030 --> 00:40:24,030
somewhat disturbing thing is that our 
government works much less well than it 

943
00:40:24,030 --> 00:40:24,030
used to.
Um,

944
00:40:24,190 --> 00:40:26,680
you know,
I think so that's my question.

945
00:40:26,681 --> 00:40:28,690
Do you do look at a moment where that.
Yes,

946
00:40:28,710 --> 00:40:33,710
yes.
I think libertarianism started probably 

947
00:40:33,710 --> 00:40:33,940
failing in the 19 seventies,
uh,

948
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:36,610
in a serious way maybe really building 
up in various ways.

949
00:40:36,611 --> 00:40:38,050
But uh,
and,

950
00:40:38,500 --> 00:40:43,500
and libertarianism,
the Libertarian party in the US started 

951
00:40:43,500 --> 00:40:46,620
in the early seventies and it sort of 
makes sense because there was sort of 

952
00:40:46,620 --> 00:40:50,551
more of an opening and so it was more 
true then than it had been before.

953
00:40:50,920 --> 00:40:55,920
And I would argue that it is,
it is much more true in 2018 than it was

954
00:40:56,770 --> 00:40:58,450
30 years,
30 years ago,

955
00:40:58,890 --> 00:40:59,540
you know,
the,

956
00:40:59,820 --> 00:41:01,080
the,
um,

957
00:41:01,420 --> 00:41:06,420
you know,
when the books were written in the 19 

958
00:41:06,420 --> 00:41:06,420
fifties,
it was like,

959
00:41:06,420 --> 00:41:10,410
it felt like it was crazy when I first 
weeks it was like so bleak,

960
00:41:10,601 --> 00:41:13,340
so pessimistic things were so,
so,

961
00:41:14,230 --> 00:41:17,290
so busted,
so broken when I first read them in like

962
00:41:17,291 --> 00:41:19,760
the late eighties,
it,

963
00:41:20,260 --> 00:41:22,540
it still felt pretty crazy,
you know.

964
00:41:22,620 --> 00:41:27,620
And then the last decade,
it's in many ways felt in a much more 

965
00:41:27,620 --> 00:41:27,790
correct.
There was,

966
00:41:27,880 --> 00:41:28,480
you know,
there's a,

967
00:41:28,940 --> 00:41:30,630
in atlas shrugged,
there's a,

968
00:41:31,320 --> 00:41:32,550
they're trying to find who,
you know,

969
00:41:33,060 --> 00:41:38,060
who is John Galt the clues eventually 
take them to the state where everything 

970
00:41:38,060 --> 00:41:39,950
has gone haywire.
It's the state of Michigan.

971
00:41:40,370 --> 00:41:42,110
And uh,
there's this great company,

972
00:41:42,111 --> 00:41:47,111
the 20th century American Motor Company 
was sort of a thinly disguised general 

973
00:41:47,111 --> 00:41:47,510
motors that had just gone bankrupt.

974
00:41:47,930 --> 00:41:51,350
And it was because we'd be completely 
mismanaged along these sort of socialist

975
00:41:51,680 --> 00:41:55,430
kinds of principles.
And Detroit was sort of falling apart.

976
00:41:55,450 --> 00:41:57,230
Some was farming in the middle of the 
city.

977
00:41:57,590 --> 00:42:00,110
And uh,
and this was like 1957,

978
00:42:00,330 --> 00:42:02,700
was just sort of a crazy thing.
And then it's,

979
00:42:02,701 --> 00:42:03,000
it's,
it's,

980
00:42:03,001 --> 00:42:05,000
it's,
it's disturbingly more true today.

981
00:42:05,030 --> 00:42:05,450
Yeah.
Well,

982
00:42:05,451 --> 00:42:07,040
you're on brook who used to be the head 
of,

983
00:42:07,220 --> 00:42:12,220
uh,
Ari and I ran institute who I've had on 

984
00:42:12,220 --> 00:42:12,220
the show many times and I do some 
speaking events with.

985
00:42:12,220 --> 00:42:16,600
He always tells me that when he travels 
internationally now that it's the 

986
00:42:16,600 --> 00:42:19,250
countries that are sort of worse off at 
the moment that are just trying to reset

987
00:42:19,490 --> 00:42:24,490
that,
find those ideas the most interesting 

988
00:42:24,490 --> 00:42:24,490
because they're just desperate for 
ideas.

989
00:42:24,490 --> 00:42:28,660
So in a way,
it almost sounds like you're calling 

990
00:42:28,660 --> 00:42:31,001
libertarianism almost a course 
correction for when either capitalism or

991
00:42:31,430 --> 00:42:34,240
not necessary capitalism for when big 
government just gets out of control.

992
00:42:34,260 --> 00:42:37,490
Libertarian can come in,
libertarianism can come in and kind of.

993
00:42:37,910 --> 00:42:40,130
Well that's the,
that's the hope.

994
00:42:40,131 --> 00:42:41,370
I mean certainly,
um,

995
00:42:41,630 --> 00:42:44,270
uh,
a lot of these sort of bad bro,

996
00:42:44,340 --> 00:42:49,340
we're chronic things don't,
don't self correct that much and it is 

997
00:42:49,671 --> 00:42:53,000
probably very hard for there to be 
incremental reform from within.

998
00:42:53,001 --> 00:42:56,270
And that's why something like sort of a 
libertarian shock therapy,

999
00:42:56,440 --> 00:43:00,110
maybe maybe what you actually maybe what
you actually need.

1000
00:43:00,150 --> 00:43:01,490
Um,
but uh,

1001
00:43:01,520 --> 00:43:03,360
but yeah,
no one way to think about what,

1002
00:43:03,420 --> 00:43:08,420
what's happened in the US is you had,
you had sort of institutions set up and 

1003
00:43:09,501 --> 00:43:13,910
then over time they sort of ossified and
degraded.

1004
00:43:14,150 --> 00:43:17,930
So when NASA was started in the 19 
fifties,

1005
00:43:18,500 --> 00:43:21,590
you had no great scientists that were 
driven,

1006
00:43:21,591 --> 00:43:26,591
motivated and then eventually it became 
sort of more and more bureaucratic and 

1007
00:43:26,591 --> 00:43:30,761
somehow the politics replaced the 
science and we can't reset it or 

1008
00:43:31,790 --> 00:43:32,330
something like this.

1009
00:43:32,330 --> 00:43:37,330
I think something like this happens by 
the way in a lot of the private sector 

1010
00:43:37,330 --> 00:43:40,211
where you know,
big companies become bureaucratic and 

1011
00:43:40,211 --> 00:43:42,851
less functional.
But in the private sector you can have 

1012
00:43:42,851 --> 00:43:44,660
new companies get started and if big 
companies are too badly run,

1013
00:43:44,840 --> 00:43:49,840
they go broke.
And in the government thing for 

1014
00:43:49,840 --> 00:43:50,270
government to go broke,
it has to be incredibly bad.

1015
00:43:50,271 --> 00:43:52,160
And the,
and the tricky question is always how do

1016
00:43:52,161 --> 00:43:53,990
you course correct before you get there?
Right?

1017
00:43:53,991 --> 00:43:58,991
So do you have a general prescription 
for how government and private 

1018
00:43:58,991 --> 00:44:03,110
enterprise can work together?
Is there a general view on when it is?

1019
00:44:03,111 --> 00:44:08,111
Right.
That seems to be what a lot of people 

1020
00:44:08,111 --> 00:44:08,111
are talking about right now because I do
sense that there is a,

1021
00:44:08,111 --> 00:44:12,130
as I would call it,
sort of a classical liberal movement 

1022
00:44:12,130 --> 00:44:12,980
happening right now or libertarian 
movement and the question always is well

1023
00:44:13,040 --> 00:44:17,600
when men is the right moment for 
government to do more or less,

1024
00:44:17,601 --> 00:44:18,770
depending on which way you look at it.

1025
00:44:18,860 --> 00:44:19,210
You know,
I don't,

1026
00:44:19,220 --> 00:44:22,100
I don't know if I have a sort of 
formulaic general answer money.

1027
00:44:22,340 --> 00:44:24,860
My,
my ideological biases,

1028
00:44:24,861 --> 00:44:29,861
libertarian is that we should have a 
smaller government that's less 

1029
00:44:29,861 --> 00:44:30,560
intrusive,
less regulatory,

1030
00:44:30,780 --> 00:44:34,140
mostly across the board.
I don't think I have to tell you exactly

1031
00:44:34,320 --> 00:44:36,270
how small it should be.
It should just be,

1032
00:44:36,271 --> 00:44:37,500
it should do less,
you know,

1033
00:44:37,950 --> 00:44:38,940
we don't have to talk about,
you know,

1034
00:44:38,941 --> 00:44:41,000
do we have to privatized roads or you 
know,

1035
00:44:41,160 --> 00:44:45,090
all this sort of crazy drivers license.
I don't want to set all the boundaries.

1036
00:44:45,100 --> 00:44:46,810
We know we have,
there's a lot of,

1037
00:44:47,160 --> 00:44:49,710
lot of room to go,
a big picture,

1038
00:44:49,980 --> 00:44:52,200
and then I think in terms of the 
details,

1039
00:44:53,040 --> 00:44:56,790
there are of course always these ways 
that you can try to reform things,

1040
00:44:56,791 --> 00:44:59,110
try to make things work better,
uh,

1041
00:44:59,280 --> 00:45:02,520
recognizing that you often have no super
entrenched bureaucracy.

1042
00:45:02,520 --> 00:45:05,970
So if you can shift from public schools 
to charter schools,

1043
00:45:05,971 --> 00:45:08,250
that's sort of a way to change the 
bureaucracy.

1044
00:45:08,251 --> 00:45:13,251
If you could,
if you could shift things where you 

1045
00:45:13,251 --> 00:45:13,251
could,
um,

1046
00:45:13,251 --> 00:45:15,090
you could fire people or you could shut 
down agencies that would probably reform

1047
00:45:15,091 --> 00:45:18,420
things quite a bit even though that's,
that's seemingly a very hard lift.

1048
00:45:18,510 --> 00:45:23,510
Yeah.
So I wanted to hold trump a little bit 

1049
00:45:23,510 --> 00:45:26,271
longer,
but I feel like this is the right segue 

1050
00:45:26,271 --> 00:45:27,420
because there's an interesting piece of 
trump that I think a lot of people,

1051
00:45:27,421 --> 00:45:31,650
a lot of libertarians are happy with 
when it comes to cutting taxes,

1052
00:45:31,980 --> 00:45:33,900
cutting regulation,
which has done a ton of,

1053
00:45:33,990 --> 00:45:36,840
and a few other things in that regard.
And then on the other hand,

1054
00:45:36,841 --> 00:45:41,841
it seems that there is a piece of him 
that's more than happy to do as many 

1055
00:45:41,841 --> 00:45:42,990
things by executive action as they'll 
allow him to do.

1056
00:45:43,200 --> 00:45:48,200
And maybe in some cases he would try to 
do things that they wouldn't allow him 

1057
00:45:48,200 --> 00:45:48,200
to do.
So you supported the guy.

1058
00:45:48,200 --> 00:45:50,630
So let's just start there.
When,

1059
00:45:50,660 --> 00:45:54,270
when it was bubbling up in your head 
that you were going to support him or at

1060
00:45:54,271 --> 00:45:55,530
least,
or get you,

1061
00:45:55,531 --> 00:45:57,270
gave his campaign money,
all of that,

1062
00:45:58,770 --> 00:46:03,770
what kind of internal discussions were 
you having with yourself or were you 

1063
00:46:03,770 --> 00:46:04,350
having it with friends and,
and colleagues and things like that?

1064
00:46:05,280 --> 00:46:06,190
Well,
um,

1065
00:46:07,470 --> 00:46:07,860
well,
the,

1066
00:46:08,030 --> 00:46:09,690
uh,
one of the things that,

1067
00:46:09,691 --> 00:46:10,880
uh,
that I would say was,

1068
00:46:11,670 --> 00:46:14,520
is I think super important issue for me 
and,

1069
00:46:14,640 --> 00:46:19,110
and I think should be for libertarians 
generally is his foreign policy.

1070
00:46:19,530 --> 00:46:24,090
And I believe that the US should have a 
less interventionist foreign policy.

1071
00:46:24,091 --> 00:46:27,390
I believe that we've gotten into too 
many stupid wars,

1072
00:46:27,590 --> 00:46:29,490
um,
over the years.

1073
00:46:29,820 --> 00:46:31,170
Um,
and that,

1074
00:46:31,200 --> 00:46:32,540
uh,
you know,

1075
00:46:32,550 --> 00:46:34,830
that sort of,
these questions of if the government can

1076
00:46:34,831 --> 00:46:39,831
kill you or in the sort of like,
that's maybe one of the most intrusive 

1077
00:46:39,831 --> 00:46:42,150
forms of government I think really hard 
about,

1078
00:46:42,210 --> 00:46:45,960
you know,
how often we do that and um,

1079
00:46:46,170 --> 00:46:48,610
and that there was some,
there was some need to,

1080
00:46:48,750 --> 00:46:49,650
to reset that.

1081
00:46:49,650 --> 00:46:51,090
And I think,
uh,

1082
00:46:51,780 --> 00:46:54,420
and so if you,
from my point of view,

1083
00:46:54,421 --> 00:46:59,421
if you,
if you got someone who's not great on a 

1084
00:46:59,421 --> 00:47:01,560
lot of issues but was libertarian on 
foreign policy,

1085
00:47:01,740 --> 00:47:06,740
that would count for a lot and if you 
had one who's good on a lot of other 

1086
00:47:06,740 --> 00:47:08,750
issues but bad on foreign policy,
um,

1087
00:47:08,970 --> 00:47:11,340
that would actually eroded in a lot of 
ways.

1088
00:47:11,341 --> 00:47:16,341
And I think the Bush 43 administration 
who was also sort of lower tax 

1089
00:47:16,341 --> 00:47:20,901
anti-regulatory,
but then because you had the insane war 

1090
00:47:20,901 --> 00:47:21,200
in Iraq,
um,

1091
00:47:21,840 --> 00:47:25,620
and you had to have all these deficits 
than you do congressional log rolling.

1092
00:47:25,920 --> 00:47:28,140
And so then you end up with no child 
left behind.

1093
00:47:28,141 --> 00:47:30,730
You end up with the Medicare part d,
the whole,

1094
00:47:30,910 --> 00:47:31,170
you know,
the,

1095
00:47:31,171 --> 00:47:34,190
all the sort of crazy expansion of,
um,

1096
00:47:34,360 --> 00:47:38,230
of the welfare state as part of the log 
rolling exercise for,

1097
00:47:38,440 --> 00:47:39,940
for the,
for the foreign wars.

1098
00:47:39,940 --> 00:47:44,940
And so if we're going to do the anti 
Bush 43 and I actually have a smaller 

1099
00:47:46,241 --> 00:47:51,241
government,
maybe the sort of our committee Dan 

1100
00:47:51,241 --> 00:47:53,510
Lever for moving that is foreign policy 
and is for us to be,

1101
00:47:53,511 --> 00:47:54,700
uh,
to be less engaged.

1102
00:47:54,701 --> 00:47:56,570
And I think that that is,
um,

1103
00:47:56,780 --> 00:47:57,260
you know,
and it,

1104
00:47:57,310 --> 00:47:58,060
it,
it was,

1105
00:47:58,120 --> 00:48:00,530
and this was,
this was the place where we're.

1106
00:48:00,640 --> 00:48:05,640
Trump broke the most sharply from a 
Republican Orthodoxy in the primaries.

1107
00:48:06,521 --> 00:48:11,521
You know,
the person who is sort of most opposed 

1108
00:48:11,521 --> 00:48:13,591
to Jeb Bush who is somehow represented 
in just a continuation of,

1109
00:48:14,200 --> 00:48:17,460
of the war strategy,
had these devastating questions like,

1110
00:48:17,470 --> 00:48:18,410
you know,
was,

1111
00:48:18,480 --> 00:48:21,890
was the Iraq war a bad idea.
And Jeb had never thought about it.

1112
00:48:24,720 --> 00:48:26,720
And um,
and it was an,

1113
00:48:26,830 --> 00:48:31,570
they had never thought about it because 
you had this Washington dc.

1114
00:48:32,010 --> 00:48:36,450
I'm pro war foreign policy bubble and it
was Clinton's,

1115
00:48:36,520 --> 00:48:37,810
the bushes,
Obama.

1116
00:48:37,811 --> 00:48:41,320
And maybe moderated a little bit,
but still got pulled into Syria.

1117
00:48:41,321 --> 00:48:44,890
We sort of messed up Libya even more 
than it had been before.

1118
00:48:45,280 --> 00:48:47,320
And uh,
and uh,

1119
00:48:47,650 --> 00:48:48,200
and,
and,

1120
00:48:48,270 --> 00:48:48,800
and,
and,

1121
00:48:48,850 --> 00:48:51,730
and I think trump represented a really 
big break.

1122
00:48:51,880 --> 00:48:53,360
I gave,
I gave to a.

1123
00:48:54,140 --> 00:48:54,660
did,
you know,

1124
00:48:54,670 --> 00:48:59,670
I spoke at the convention in Twenty 
Sixteen and then I'm also spoken in the 

1125
00:48:59,670 --> 00:48:59,670
fall at the,
uh,

1126
00:48:59,890 --> 00:49:01,990
at the Washington Press Club in both 
speeches.

1127
00:49:01,991 --> 00:49:04,990
I,
I stressed this foreign policy theme,

1128
00:49:05,060 --> 00:49:05,850
so it was,
uh,

1129
00:49:06,280 --> 00:49:07,210
it was that,
uh,

1130
00:49:07,400 --> 00:49:08,500
you know,
should we,

1131
00:49:09,400 --> 00:49:11,560
should we,
should the US really be,

1132
00:49:11,800 --> 00:49:16,800
you know,
how aggressively should the US be 

1133
00:49:16,800 --> 00:49:17,170
involved in Syria and risk a 
confrontation with,

1134
00:49:17,190 --> 00:49:18,060
uh,
with,

1135
00:49:18,080 --> 00:49:18,760
with Russia.

1136
00:49:19,510 --> 00:49:22,630
And I think trump's instincts continue 
to be,

1137
00:49:23,610 --> 00:49:25,720
you know,
much less in this,

1138
00:49:25,770 --> 00:49:28,150
in this sort of super power 
confrontation.

1139
00:49:28,151 --> 00:49:33,151
And if you,
if you look at where the opposition to 

1140
00:49:33,151 --> 00:49:33,151
president trump comes from,
the sort of,

1141
00:49:33,151 --> 00:49:38,110
the most deranged part of it is from the
neoconservative Republicans because this

1142
00:49:39,341 --> 00:49:41,840
is where he's broken the most with 
orthodoxy.

1143
00:49:41,940 --> 00:49:45,010
We have Russia debate is a completely 
insane,

1144
00:49:45,220 --> 00:49:48,750
the bank that we have like this where,
you know,

1145
00:49:49,840 --> 00:49:52,440
I think trump has been consistent for 30
years.

1146
00:49:52,510 --> 00:49:56,170
We should not have,
even if Putin's and man,

1147
00:49:56,171 --> 00:50:01,171
it doesn't mean that we should be 
risking a nuclear war with Russia sort 

1148
00:50:01,171 --> 00:50:05,111
of bag used to be a position of the left
by the way recently as 2012 when,

1149
00:50:05,971 --> 00:50:10,971
you know,
when Romney was hawkish on Russia and 

1150
00:50:10,971 --> 00:50:11,590
Obama said the eighties or calling and 
this is like.

1151
00:50:12,070 --> 00:50:17,070
And then so there's something about it 
that's just incredibly crazy how tribal 

1152
00:50:17,070 --> 00:50:17,110
it is.

1153
00:50:17,170 --> 00:50:22,170
Well,
it's so interesting because that moment 

1154
00:50:22,170 --> 00:50:23,940
in the debate between Romney and Obama,
if the left was being consistent about 

1155
00:50:23,940 --> 00:50:28,081
this,
they'd be looking at Obama now and 

1156
00:50:28,081 --> 00:50:28,081
going,
man,

1157
00:50:28,081 --> 00:50:28,520
you must have been the worst president 
of all time because you misjudged that.

1158
00:50:28,521 --> 00:50:31,910
And then that led us to our Russian 
puppet president or something.

1159
00:50:31,911 --> 00:50:36,911
But you don't see that side.
You don't see that sort of consistency 

1160
00:50:36,911 --> 00:50:39,290
at anyone these days.
I suppose it feels incredibly deranged.

1161
00:50:39,291 --> 00:50:39,700
But,
uh,

1162
00:50:39,950 --> 00:50:41,940
but certainly the intuition is that,
uh,

1163
00:50:42,770 --> 00:50:46,490
we shouldn't be this fixated on 
escalating,

1164
00:50:47,050 --> 00:50:49,240
escalating these potentially military 
complex with,

1165
00:50:49,420 --> 00:50:53,050
with places like Russia and,
and to the extent we have that as,

1166
00:50:53,230 --> 00:50:55,490
as the focus,
it distracts us from,

1167
00:50:55,700 --> 00:51:00,700
from a lot of other things to distracts 
us from the very real economic 

1168
00:51:00,700 --> 00:51:03,380
competition we have with China and which
I think is something we should be taking

1169
00:51:03,381 --> 00:51:04,130
more seriously.

1170
00:51:04,340 --> 00:51:09,340
And then of course even more importantly
maybe distracts us from mom from are 

1171
00:51:09,530 --> 00:51:12,560
solving some of the problems at home.
So I do think,

1172
00:51:12,590 --> 00:51:17,590
you know,
the foreign having a less aggressive 

1173
00:51:17,590 --> 00:51:20,381
foreign policy,
that's maybe the preliminary step to 

1174
00:51:20,381 --> 00:51:23,600
getting to then really fixing on solving
our own problems.

1175
00:51:23,630 --> 00:51:27,500
Does that show you how,
how derange the conversation has gotten?

1176
00:51:27,501 --> 00:51:29,830
Because if you listen to conventional 
thinking on this,

1177
00:51:29,840 --> 00:51:32,090
most of,
I think trump's critics will say,

1178
00:51:32,091 --> 00:51:34,760
look,
he's saying all these things about North

1179
00:51:34,760 --> 00:51:38,510
Korea or he's making all these threats 
about Syria or we drop the mother of all

1180
00:51:38,511 --> 00:51:43,511
bombs or all of these things.
But you're actually making the reverse 

1181
00:51:43,511 --> 00:51:43,511
argument.
I mean,

1182
00:51:43,511 --> 00:51:45,110
they're trying to argue that he's really
the warmonger,

1183
00:51:45,111 --> 00:51:47,570
he's the one that's going to lead us to 
a world war three.

1184
00:51:47,870 --> 00:51:52,870
And really your argument is he's the one
doing the reverse of those things,

1185
00:51:53,181 --> 00:51:54,530
at least for now.

1186
00:51:54,590 --> 00:51:55,050
Yes.
I mean,

1187
00:51:55,100 --> 00:51:55,520
look,
I think,

1188
00:51:55,521 --> 00:52:00,521
I think there is.
We have a certain type of military 

1189
00:52:00,521 --> 00:52:01,730
industrial complex and so there are 
parts of this that are sort of almost on

1190
00:52:01,731 --> 00:52:03,170
autopilot,
but,

1191
00:52:03,171 --> 00:52:03,740
uh,
but,

1192
00:52:03,830 --> 00:52:08,000
but certainly I think all of president 
trump's instincts are to,

1193
00:52:08,770 --> 00:52:09,710
you know,
it's like,

1194
00:52:09,800 --> 00:52:10,220
you know,
if,

1195
00:52:10,410 --> 00:52:11,170
if,
um,

1196
00:52:11,360 --> 00:52:14,270
we have to rethink NATO,
we have to rethink,

1197
00:52:14,700 --> 00:52:19,700
you know,
how much we should really be committed 

1198
00:52:19,700 --> 00:52:19,700
to Afghanistan.
We have to,

1199
00:52:19,700 --> 00:52:23,310
you know,
we shouldn't be escalating like crazy 

1200
00:52:23,310 --> 00:52:23,310
with,
with Russia.

1201
00:52:23,310 --> 00:52:23,630
And so,
um,

1202
00:52:23,780 --> 00:52:28,780
you know,
you have the North Korea dictators a 

1203
00:52:28,780 --> 00:52:30,500
genocidal maniac,
but we'll talk to him.

1204
00:52:31,130 --> 00:52:33,020
So I think the instincts are,
um,

1205
00:52:33,440 --> 00:52:35,450
are,
are very powerfully in the,

1206
00:52:35,451 --> 00:52:37,010
uh,
deescalate Tory side.

1207
00:52:37,100 --> 00:52:42,100
What is it about trump that made you 
think this is the guy could do that 

1208
00:52:42,100 --> 00:52:46,841
because we,
as I was hearing you say that you could 

1209
00:52:46,841 --> 00:52:46,841
have said,
well,

1210
00:52:46,841 --> 00:52:49,271
Ron Rand Paul,
he's doing a pretty good job on that 

1211
00:52:49,271 --> 00:52:49,271
stuff,
right?

1212
00:52:49,271 --> 00:52:50,930
He's been talking about getting out of 
these wars for a long time.

1213
00:52:50,931 --> 00:52:53,990
Like you could have been.
Even when I would watch the debates,

1214
00:52:53,991 --> 00:52:58,991
I'd be like this poor guy.
He's on the stage with the wrong group 

1215
00:52:58,991 --> 00:52:58,991
of people.
He's making a lot of sense to me.

1216
00:52:58,991 --> 00:53:00,050
Uh,
but I support it.

1217
00:53:00,051 --> 00:53:01,400
You know,
I did support Ron Paul,

1218
00:53:01,550 --> 00:53:06,550
Ron Paul in both 2008 and 2012.
I think that,

1219
00:53:07,221 --> 00:53:08,450
uh,
you know,

1220
00:53:08,610 --> 00:53:11,470
I think in some ways a,
um,

1221
00:53:12,110 --> 00:53:17,110
ran.
Paul was sort of making those arguments 

1222
00:53:17,110 --> 00:53:19,360
will.
I actually think trump made them more 

1223
00:53:19,360 --> 00:53:21,161
powerfully in the 2015 slash 2016 
primaries than even even a rand Paul.

1224
00:53:22,191 --> 00:53:25,730
And to critique rand Paul a little bit 
on this hit,

1225
00:53:26,310 --> 00:53:28,470
it was sort of,
he was sort of making this judgment call

1226
00:53:28,471 --> 00:53:30,600
that his dad hadn't been able to get 
enough boats.

1227
00:53:30,720 --> 00:53:32,330
And so he got to be a little bit,
uh,

1228
00:53:32,370 --> 00:53:37,370
less dubbish on foreign policy,
had to be a little bit more agreeable 

1229
00:53:37,370 --> 00:53:41,060
and of course he didn't end up doing 
much less well than his dad because he 

1230
00:53:41,060 --> 00:53:45,270
sort of in a way downplayed what 
might've been in one of his best issues.

1231
00:53:45,270 --> 00:53:47,970
And then,
and then trump just articulated far more

1232
00:53:47,971 --> 00:53:52,971
powerfully.
So what is that x factor thing with 

1233
00:53:52,971 --> 00:53:55,611
trump?
Because obviously this was starting to 

1234
00:53:55,611 --> 00:53:55,920
be like a runaway train and the,
all the momentum was there.

1235
00:53:55,921 --> 00:54:00,921
All the media attention was there.
It takes us back to the beginning of 

1236
00:54:00,921 --> 00:54:05,001
when we sat down the way you described 
paypal when it started really getting 

1237
00:54:05,001 --> 00:54:06,390
into that growth phase.
So you must've seen that too.

1238
00:54:06,391 --> 00:54:07,050
And thought,
all right,

1239
00:54:07,350 --> 00:54:11,070
the right ideas are kind of here.
But really what I'm seeing is it's,

1240
00:54:11,400 --> 00:54:11,940
well,
there's,

1241
00:54:12,420 --> 00:54:17,420
you're at least talking about some 
things you're talking about some of the 

1242
00:54:17,420 --> 00:54:17,550
important substantive things that we 
should be talking about.

1243
00:54:17,670 --> 00:54:18,200
And,
uh,

1244
00:54:18,720 --> 00:54:19,760
and uh,
you know,

1245
00:54:19,770 --> 00:54:20,430
part of,
again,

1246
00:54:20,431 --> 00:54:25,431
part of the negative part is that it's a
contrast to how bad and a lot of the 

1247
00:54:25,431 --> 00:54:29,631
other people were.
I met a number of the different 

1248
00:54:29,631 --> 00:54:32,931
Republican candidates running in 2016 
and a small one on one meetings and I 

1249
00:54:33,141 --> 00:54:34,610
think they're like zombies,
you know,

1250
00:54:34,780 --> 00:54:35,490
and it was just,
you know,

1251
00:54:35,491 --> 00:54:35,910
you had to do.

1252
00:54:35,920 --> 00:54:38,350
So the ideological talking points,
um,

1253
00:54:38,510 --> 00:54:41,910
it was sort of not fluid,
very hard to,

1254
00:54:41,911 --> 00:54:42,750
um,
to,

1255
00:54:42,751 --> 00:54:44,480
um,
get off script to,

1256
00:54:44,760 --> 00:54:49,590
to say anything and um,
and that somehow wasn't,

1257
00:54:49,620 --> 00:54:51,810
wasn't quite what was called for.
And of course,

1258
00:54:51,811 --> 00:54:56,811
you know,
there was something else about Hillary 

1259
00:54:56,811 --> 00:54:56,811
Clinton that was very much like this.
And uh,

1260
00:54:56,850 --> 00:54:57,600
and I think,
you know,

1261
00:54:57,750 --> 00:55:02,750
I think the revisionist history people 
like to now say is that Hillary Clinton 

1262
00:55:02,821 --> 00:55:05,350
was this terrible candidate.
And I,

1263
00:55:05,490 --> 00:55:06,450
I think,
I think she was,

1264
00:55:06,540 --> 00:55:09,030
she was the best candidate the 
establishment could put up.

1265
00:55:09,520 --> 00:55:10,500
Um,
it was just,

1266
00:55:10,501 --> 00:55:12,600
the ideas were wrong.
That didn't make sense.

1267
00:55:13,170 --> 00:55:18,170
You know,
Hillary Clinton thinks she should run 

1268
00:55:18,170 --> 00:55:18,170
again in 20,
20.

1269
00:55:18,170 --> 00:55:20,340
And in a way she's right.
Because from her point of view,

1270
00:55:20,341 --> 00:55:24,510
I understand why she thinks that because
she's smarter than the other Democrats,

1271
00:55:24,570 --> 00:55:29,570
she has more experience and you know,
within the Zombie Establishment,

1272
00:55:30,370 --> 00:55:35,370
um,
it still makes more sense for it to be 

1273
00:55:35,370 --> 00:55:37,110
hillary than someone like cory booker,
Kamala Harris.

1274
00:55:37,560 --> 00:55:40,710
But the ideas are just,
the ideas would just become,

1275
00:55:41,130 --> 00:55:42,930
you know,
completely ossified.

1276
00:55:43,260 --> 00:55:46,870
What does it say about sort of the state
of the West that when things are,

1277
00:55:46,960 --> 00:55:50,100
are basically pretty good,
not to say they're perfect,

1278
00:55:50,101 --> 00:55:55,101
but basically pretty good that there's 
always this feeling that the 

1279
00:55:55,101 --> 00:55:57,840
establishment has to be destroyed or 
washed away.

1280
00:55:59,280 --> 00:56:00,840
Well,
um,

1281
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:04,190
well we,
there's,

1282
00:56:04,630 --> 00:56:09,630
well that's a big question,
but I think there's something that goes 

1283
00:56:09,630 --> 00:56:09,750
back in our,
you know,

1284
00:56:09,770 --> 00:56:10,530
we,
we are,

1285
00:56:11,240 --> 00:56:16,240
you know,
there's something about western Western 

1286
00:56:16,240 --> 00:56:17,890
civilization that is,
it is perhaps unique is sort of like,

1287
00:56:17,940 --> 00:56:19,500
it's open,
it's,

1288
00:56:20,210 --> 00:56:23,100
it's self referential,
self critical.

1289
00:56:23,620 --> 00:56:24,160
And so,

1290
00:56:24,160 --> 00:56:25,420
um,
and so,

1291
00:56:25,421 --> 00:56:26,320
uh,
and,

1292
00:56:26,321 --> 00:56:31,321
and you don't have the sort of internal 
self criticism and in other societies 

1293
00:56:31,901 --> 00:56:33,190
and other cultures.
And so,

1294
00:56:33,490 --> 00:56:34,240
you know,
there's always,

1295
00:56:34,450 --> 00:56:35,350
there's always an argument that,
you know,

1296
00:56:35,351 --> 00:56:37,570
ours is an extra stream,
really racist,

1297
00:56:37,571 --> 00:56:41,050
sexist society discriminates and all 
kinds of ways.

1298
00:56:41,051 --> 00:56:42,720
And um,
you know,

1299
00:56:42,770 --> 00:56:44,790
without challenging that for now,
um,

1300
00:56:45,340 --> 00:56:48,490
you can also say that ours is a society 
that cares a lot about racism,

1301
00:56:48,491 --> 00:56:53,491
sex,
and the cares a lot about injustices 

1302
00:56:53,491 --> 00:56:53,920
that the ways things are not working.
And so I think,

1303
00:56:54,220 --> 00:56:59,220
um,
and so I think the establishment is not 

1304
00:56:59,220 --> 00:57:02,791
gotten a free pass in our society for a,
for a very long time.

1305
00:57:02,831 --> 00:57:05,020
And that's,
and you can say that's,

1306
00:57:05,230 --> 00:57:08,080
that's unhealthy and it makes us weak or
divided.

1307
00:57:08,380 --> 00:57:08,890
But,
uh,

1308
00:57:08,920 --> 00:57:10,690
but I think it's,
it's a,

1309
00:57:10,890 --> 00:57:14,200
it's part of the motor that drives our,
our civilization.

1310
00:57:14,200 --> 00:57:14,560
And,
you know,

1311
00:57:14,990 --> 00:57:17,380
maybe it,
maybe it goes back to,

1312
00:57:18,210 --> 00:57:23,210
you know,
in sort of the enlightenment or the 

1313
00:57:23,210 --> 00:57:23,580
renaissance or um,
you know,

1314
00:57:23,820 --> 00:57:26,380
the Greco Roman or Judeo Christian 
traditions.

1315
00:57:26,381 --> 00:57:27,120
But,
uh,

1316
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:30,430
when,
when Jesus Christ says that he's the son

1317
00:57:30,431 --> 00:57:32,060
of God,
um,

1318
00:57:32,590 --> 00:57:33,320
you know,
you can,

1319
00:57:33,760 --> 00:57:36,310
you can describe that as a metaphysical 
religious statement,

1320
00:57:36,700 --> 00:57:41,700
but you can also describe it as a 
politically atheist statement because 

1321
00:57:41,700 --> 00:57:45,870
Caesar Augustus was the emperor and 
Cesar has sort of adopted father,

1322
00:57:46,751 --> 00:57:51,751
had been divinized Caesar.
Augustus also claimed to be the son of 

1323
00:57:51,751 --> 00:57:53,410
God.
And when Jesus Christ says that he's the

1324
00:57:53,411 --> 00:57:55,870
son of God,
that is a challenge.

1325
00:57:55,871 --> 00:57:58,840
The establishment.
That's an act of political atheism.

1326
00:57:58,841 --> 00:58:03,010
It's the state is not divine.
The establishment is not divine.

1327
00:58:03,430 --> 00:58:06,100
And that I think that's,
that's just,

1328
00:58:06,420 --> 00:58:08,110
that's just been part of our 
civilization.

1329
00:58:08,111 --> 00:58:13,111
And I'd be,
I'd be much more worried if people 

1330
00:58:13,111 --> 00:58:13,111
stopped,
stopped,

1331
00:58:13,111 --> 00:58:14,320
stopped,
stopped asking these questions.

1332
00:58:14,410 --> 00:58:19,410
Yeah.
So for the people that are watching or 

1333
00:58:19,410 --> 00:58:21,511
listening to this right now that still 
have all the concerns about trump that 

1334
00:58:22,211 --> 00:58:27,211
you may or may not have or,
or that you feel maybe are somewhat 

1335
00:58:27,211 --> 00:58:30,391
deranged in terms of the conversation,
you've met the guy obviously a bunch of 

1336
00:58:30,391 --> 00:58:30,391
times,
you know,

1337
00:58:30,391 --> 00:58:34,540
there's that one video when you guys had
that slightly awkward handshake.

1338
00:58:34,570 --> 00:58:35,470
Is there anything.
Well,

1339
00:58:35,471 --> 00:58:40,471
first I guess I have two parts to this,
one is do you have any regrets about 

1340
00:58:40,471 --> 00:58:40,900
supporting him or speaking at the 
convention?

1341
00:58:40,901 --> 00:58:42,940
And I want to talk a little bit more 
about that in a minute also.

1342
00:58:43,260 --> 00:58:45,370
Um,
but also is there something that you can

1343
00:58:45,371 --> 00:58:48,760
impart on us that maybe we don't know or
that's not being told,

1344
00:58:49,170 --> 00:58:49,840
uh,
you know,

1345
00:58:49,841 --> 00:58:54,841
just from sitting down with the guy is 
more stable than the way the media would

1346
00:58:55,151 --> 00:58:57,250
portray it or something along those 
lines.

1347
00:58:57,251 --> 00:58:58,420
We certainly more or less

1348
00:58:59,080 --> 00:59:04,080
very smart and uh,
and it sort of a common sense intuitive 

1349
00:59:04,811 --> 00:59:06,880
thing.
And so there's sort of a way that,

1350
00:59:07,170 --> 00:59:10,450
you know,
he can x Ray people and get an immediate

1351
00:59:10,451 --> 00:59:15,451
read on,
on somebody that's incredibly 

1352
00:59:15,451 --> 00:59:15,451
impressive.

1353
00:59:15,451 --> 00:59:18,540
Yeah.
And so do you think there's a risk in 

1354
00:59:18,540 --> 00:59:20,491
that also always relying on that 
instinct as opposed to it's why,

1355
00:59:20,740 --> 00:59:22,100
you know,
they always are risks with these

1356
00:59:22,100 --> 00:59:22,880
things,
but that's,

1357
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:23,900
that's,
you know,

1358
00:59:24,170 --> 00:59:25,040
it's,
it's a,

1359
00:59:25,220 --> 00:59:28,330
it's a powerful ability.
And,

1360
00:59:28,340 --> 00:59:29,480
um,
and then,

1361
00:59:29,510 --> 00:59:31,430
uh,
and then there is a degree to which,

1362
00:59:31,930 --> 00:59:35,080
you know,
he has his ideas and um,

1363
00:59:35,720 --> 00:59:36,480
you know,
it's,

1364
00:59:36,500 --> 00:59:41,500
it's sort of,
he's thought these things through for 

1365
00:59:41,500 --> 00:59:41,840
himself and uh,
and so the evidence that,

1366
00:59:41,950 --> 00:59:43,790
you know,
he's not as conformance does that,

1367
00:59:44,300 --> 00:59:45,920
is that the ideas are actually pretty 
different.

1368
00:59:45,980 --> 00:59:46,410
You know,
it's,

1369
00:59:46,580 --> 00:59:47,570
it's,
you know,

1370
00:59:47,571 --> 00:59:50,990
is broken with the Republican Orthodoxy 
on foreign policy.

1371
00:59:51,350 --> 00:59:52,580
You know,
there's um,

1372
00:59:52,750 --> 00:59:55,040
you know,
rethinking the immigration question,

1373
00:59:55,041 --> 00:59:58,130
rethinking the free trade questions and 
um,

1374
00:59:58,450 --> 00:59:59,450
and these are,
these are,

1375
00:59:59,690 --> 01:00:02,900
these were like not,
not mainstream views at all,

1376
01:00:02,960 --> 01:00:06,980
pre 2016 and um,
and there is a way in which,

1377
01:00:06,981 --> 01:00:07,690
uh,
w what,

1378
01:00:07,710 --> 01:00:12,130
what I think has been even more 
impressive than I would have expected is

1379
01:00:12,390 --> 01:00:14,210
the degree to which the debate has 
shifted.

1380
01:00:14,600 --> 01:00:15,800
And so if we,
if we take the,

1381
01:00:16,190 --> 01:00:16,700
the,
um,

1382
01:00:16,820 --> 01:00:18,390
the debate about free trade,
you know,

1383
01:00:18,410 --> 01:00:23,410
the consensus in 2015 would have been 
free trade is simply good in all times 

1384
01:00:24,441 --> 01:00:27,590
in all places.
And if you don't understand that,

1385
01:00:27,591 --> 01:00:29,990
then you didn't study econ one and 
you're,

1386
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:31,610
you know,
you're a low Iq person.

1387
01:00:31,700 --> 01:00:36,700
End of argument and um,
and at this point it's much closer to 

1388
01:00:37,591 --> 01:00:37,760
the,
you know,

1389
01:00:37,761 --> 01:00:42,761
there's obviously something just very,
very wrong with a lot of the trade 

1390
01:00:42,761 --> 01:00:43,140
arrangements in the world and it's like,
uh,

1391
01:00:43,880 --> 01:00:44,450
you know,
we have,

1392
01:00:44,570 --> 01:00:45,140
we have,
uh,

1393
01:00:45,990 --> 01:00:50,030
we import $475,000,000,000
a year from China.

1394
01:00:50,031 --> 01:00:55,031
We export $100 million a year to China 
and it's completely unbalanced and it's 

1395
01:00:56,190 --> 01:01:01,190
actually not.
If we had a genuinely globalizing world 

1396
01:01:01,190 --> 01:01:01,850
that's not the way it would look at all 
in a globalizing world,

1397
01:01:02,100 --> 01:01:03,230
um,
the,

1398
01:01:03,231 --> 01:01:08,231
uh,
the less developed parts of the world 

1399
01:01:08,231 --> 01:01:10,421
would grow faster and therefore capital 
should flow to those parts and therefore

1400
01:01:12,380 --> 01:01:17,380
we should have a trade surplus with 
China that we get extra capital that we 

1401
01:01:17,380 --> 01:01:18,790
then export through.

1402
01:01:18,790 --> 01:01:23,790
In a way,
you're almost making a globalist 

1403
01:01:23,790 --> 01:01:25,640
argument for him,
even though he's always against the 

1404
01:01:25,640 --> 01:01:25,760
global a little differently.
So it's.

1405
01:01:25,761 --> 01:01:30,500
I would say that I would say that the 
incredible trade imbalances tell us that

1406
01:01:30,501 --> 01:01:35,501
something's completely wrong with the 
sort of pollyannish globalization story 

1407
01:01:35,691 --> 01:01:40,691
were told of Chinese peasants saving 
money and it's being sent upstream into 

1408
01:01:43,341 --> 01:01:48,341
the slower growing us and even slower 
growing Japan and western Europe and 

1409
01:01:49,020 --> 01:01:51,560
it's all the money is flowing,
it's flowing in the wrong direction,

1410
01:01:52,070 --> 01:01:57,070
and that tells us something.
Then we can debate what do you do about 

1411
01:01:57,070 --> 01:01:57,140
it,
you know,

1412
01:01:57,650 --> 01:02:00,380
do you escalate in order to deescalate 
you?

1413
01:02:00,710 --> 01:02:03,410
Do how,
how do you rethink these things?

1414
01:02:03,680 --> 01:02:04,910
But uh,
but it's,

1415
01:02:04,970 --> 01:02:07,090
it's all,
it's all been opened up and I,

1416
01:02:07,440 --> 01:02:12,440
the prediction I would make is that 
whoever the Democratic nominee in 2020 

1417
01:02:12,440 --> 01:02:13,100
is,
they will not,

1418
01:02:13,550 --> 01:02:16,340
they will not disagree with trump on the
trade issue.

1419
01:02:17,020 --> 01:02:19,040
They won't admit the trump changed their
mind.

1420
01:02:20,040 --> 01:02:22,320
But this is one of the ways you win 
debates is that,

1421
01:02:22,321 --> 01:02:24,210
uh,
people come around to your side and they

1422
01:02:24,690 --> 01:02:26,000
still say they never.
No.

1423
01:02:26,001 --> 01:02:28,650
It wasn't because of you.
That's how you really went.

1424
01:02:28,720 --> 01:02:33,720
Yeah.
It was that his really clever move 

1425
01:02:33,720 --> 01:02:33,720
during the primary still where he kept 
saying,

1426
01:02:33,720 --> 01:02:38,541
oh,
look how unfairly the DNC is treating 

1427
01:02:38,541 --> 01:02:41,121
Bernie,
because basically he was hinting to all 

1428
01:02:41,121 --> 01:02:43,581
of those people that were so frustrated 
with the system when they screw him 

1429
01:02:43,581 --> 01:02:43,581
over,
guess what?

1430
01:02:43,581 --> 01:02:44,130
I'm your guy.
It's not,

1431
01:02:44,160 --> 01:02:45,480
it's not hillary.
So it was a pretty,

1432
01:02:45,720 --> 01:02:47,460
pretty,
pretty clever little.

1433
01:02:47,490 --> 01:02:49,740
Typically they're all these,
all these things like this,

1434
01:02:49,741 --> 01:02:50,820
but I think,
I think it is,

1435
01:02:50,821 --> 01:02:54,750
it is just these other debates were a 
country,

1436
01:02:55,410 --> 01:02:56,370
you know,
I think,

1437
01:02:56,630 --> 01:02:58,260
you know,
the question about NATO is,

1438
01:02:58,610 --> 01:03:02,430
is on the table now and once you put it 
on the table,

1439
01:03:02,930 --> 01:03:03,660
uh,
you know,

1440
01:03:03,690 --> 01:03:08,690
why should the US be paying the lion's 
share when we're actually mostly 

1441
01:03:08,690 --> 01:03:09,330
defending these other countries.

1442
01:03:09,450 --> 01:03:12,030
It's not like NATO is on the southern 
border defending us from Mexico.

1443
01:03:12,090 --> 01:03:12,540
Right,
right.

1444
01:03:12,541 --> 01:03:17,541
And you,
if you listen to the way the mainstream 

1445
01:03:17,541 --> 01:03:17,541
media focusing,
it's always,

1446
01:03:17,541 --> 01:03:18,840
well,
trump wants to blow up NATO,

1447
01:03:19,020 --> 01:03:24,020
but that's not really what he said.
He said he wants other countries to pay 

1448
01:03:24,020 --> 01:03:24,810
their fair share.
Those are very,

1449
01:03:24,811 --> 01:03:26,340
very different things.
Yes.

1450
01:03:26,580 --> 01:03:26,850
I mean,
they're,

1451
01:03:26,860 --> 01:03:28,440
they're,
they're link because you might say,

1452
01:03:28,441 --> 01:03:30,030
you know,
if you don't,

1453
01:03:30,270 --> 01:03:31,080
you know,
we're,

1454
01:03:31,350 --> 01:03:36,350
we're,
we might be willing to pull out if you 

1455
01:03:36,350 --> 01:03:36,350
don't pay your fair share.
So it's not,

1456
01:03:36,350 --> 01:03:37,050
it's not like we're never going to 
change.

1457
01:03:37,051 --> 01:03:37,620
But,
uh,

1458
01:03:37,740 --> 01:03:38,820
but certainly,
um,

1459
01:03:39,120 --> 01:03:40,500
certainly,
uh,

1460
01:03:41,310 --> 01:03:42,570
people,
people,

1461
01:03:42,660 --> 01:03:44,700
nobody would disagree that everyone 
should pay their fair share.

1462
01:03:44,780 --> 01:03:46,440
I want to talk to even people in 
Germany,

1463
01:03:46,441 --> 01:03:51,441
which is like prompt,
maybe the most egregious offender of 

1464
01:03:51,441 --> 01:03:52,020
all.
Nobody disagrees with this behind closed

1465
01:03:52,021 --> 01:03:52,410
doors.

1466
01:03:53,490 --> 01:03:56,490
So do you have any regrets?
I don't have any regrets about it.

1467
01:03:56,990 --> 01:03:57,300
You know,
I,

1468
01:03:57,310 --> 01:03:57,810
I,
I,

1469
01:03:57,950 --> 01:04:00,000
I would say that it,
um,

1470
01:04:00,230 --> 01:04:05,230
it certainly was,
it's been a crazier two years and I 

1471
01:04:05,230 --> 01:04:06,930
would have thought and uh,
and I underestimated how,

1472
01:04:07,370 --> 01:04:12,370
you know,
how intense some of the feelings people 

1473
01:04:12,370 --> 01:04:12,510
have about politics are,
but no regrets.

1474
01:04:12,700 --> 01:04:13,590
Yeah.
What do you make?

1475
01:04:13,710 --> 01:04:17,490
Just the general tenor then right now 
that we sort of are between a rock and a

1476
01:04:17,491 --> 01:04:22,491
hard place where it's like you've got 
trump and he's not going to change his 

1477
01:04:22,491 --> 01:04:22,860
tactics.
And,

1478
01:04:22,861 --> 01:04:27,861
you know,
I think I've been very fair to him and 

1479
01:04:27,861 --> 01:04:29,541
that's why I get a lot of criticism on 
that front end and then you've got the 

1480
01:04:29,541 --> 01:04:29,610
resistance or whatever you want to call 
it,

1481
01:04:29,611 --> 01:04:34,611
that seems to be doubling down on a lot 
of the bad ideas that got them there in 

1482
01:04:34,611 --> 01:04:39,291
the first place and that both sides now,
or just splitting and splitting and 

1483
01:04:39,291 --> 01:04:39,590
we're,
we're losing what I,

1484
01:04:39,630 --> 01:04:44,630
where I think most people are,
which is within some sort of basically 

1485
01:04:45,271 --> 01:04:48,570
free society,
Libertarian live and let live thing.

1486
01:04:48,570 --> 01:04:50,340
I think I really believe that's where 
most people are,

1487
01:04:50,341 --> 01:04:53,370
but we seem to be being pulled in in 
opposite ways.

1488
01:04:53,460 --> 01:04:58,460
Well,
the way that we framed a little 

1489
01:04:58,460 --> 01:04:58,460
differently,
I would say we're,

1490
01:04:58,880 --> 01:04:59,730
we're,
um,

1491
01:04:59,850 --> 01:05:03,630
we're moving past the Bush Clinton,
um,

1492
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:06,840
sort of do awfully.
And um,

1493
01:05:07,470 --> 01:05:10,690
and which was not exactly libertarian,
um,

1494
01:05:10,890 --> 01:05:13,380
it was pretty narrow,
pretty narrow zone.

1495
01:05:13,680 --> 01:05:15,810
There wasn't very much debate,
you know,

1496
01:05:16,050 --> 01:05:21,050
all the smart people supposedly agreed 
on everything and it didn't work all 

1497
01:05:21,071 --> 01:05:22,760
that well.
At the end of the day,

1498
01:05:22,761 --> 01:05:23,980
you know,
we had sort of a,

1499
01:05:23,981 --> 01:05:24,940
you know,
one,

1500
01:05:25,090 --> 01:05:28,690
one fake bubble in our economy after 
another and um,

1501
01:05:28,930 --> 01:05:29,980
and it,
and,

1502
01:05:30,010 --> 01:05:35,010
you know,
it sort of got us into a lot of things 

1503
01:05:35,010 --> 01:05:35,010
that,
that were,

1504
01:05:35,010 --> 01:05:35,010
were not optimal.
So,

1505
01:05:35,010 --> 01:05:39,611
uh,
so I think for the Bush Clinton maybe 

1506
01:05:39,611 --> 01:05:42,940
also Obama years was 24 years.
The debate I would say was,

1507
01:05:43,090 --> 01:05:43,870
was,
was,

1508
01:05:43,871 --> 01:05:45,220
uh,
was too narrow.

1509
01:05:45,610 --> 01:05:50,610
And I think within that sort of super 
narrow center to center left debate in 

1510
01:05:51,161 --> 01:05:52,210
this country,
uh,

1511
01:05:52,240 --> 01:05:57,240
you,
you're not going to find the solutions 

1512
01:05:57,240 --> 01:05:59,701
to our problems.
It's gonna be it's gonna be way outside 

1513
01:05:59,701 --> 01:05:59,701
of that.
And I think,

1514
01:05:59,701 --> 01:06:00,940
you know,
I think we will not go back.

1515
01:06:01,150 --> 01:06:06,150
You know,
we're not going to go back to Hillary 

1516
01:06:06,150 --> 01:06:06,150
Clinton and 20 slash 20.
We're not going to go back to Jeb Bush.

1517
01:06:06,150 --> 01:06:07,510
Um,
and,

1518
01:06:07,511 --> 01:06:08,050
uh,
it,

1519
01:06:08,051 --> 01:06:09,130
it's,
it's going to be,

1520
01:06:09,340 --> 01:06:11,790
it's going to be a more wide open debate
and they're,

1521
01:06:11,800 --> 01:06:13,730
the parts of it that I don't like.
I don't.

1522
01:06:13,800 --> 01:06:14,920
I think,
I think,

1523
01:06:14,950 --> 01:06:19,950
uh,
I think the socialist question is going 

1524
01:06:19,950 --> 01:06:21,940
to be on the table in ways that it 
hasn't been for a long time and uh,

1525
01:06:22,040 --> 01:06:27,040
and I think I suspect the Democratic 
Party is going to move much further to 

1526
01:06:27,040 --> 01:06:30,811
the left and that's going to be a debate
we're going to be having for the next 

1527
01:06:30,910 --> 01:06:30,910
decade.

1528
01:06:31,480 --> 01:06:33,820
I think they're wrong.
I think that's not gonna work,

1529
01:06:34,030 --> 01:06:35,140
but it's,
it's,

1530
01:06:35,141 --> 01:06:36,460
again,
it's the Clinton,

1531
01:06:36,790 --> 01:06:40,120
the narrow Clinton stuff.
I'm not going back to that.

1532
01:06:40,300 --> 01:06:41,860
Okay.
So one more thing on trump for now.

1533
01:06:41,910 --> 01:06:45,460
When you finally then came out,
so to speak and said,

1534
01:06:45,461 --> 01:06:47,440
all right,
I'm going to support trump.

1535
01:06:48,190 --> 01:06:50,320
Just personally,
do you feel like your cost,

1536
01:06:50,321 --> 01:06:51,820
you anything just,
you know,

1537
01:06:52,240 --> 01:06:53,350
friends,
family,

1538
01:06:53,351 --> 01:06:58,351
like,
or did you even care if that was going 

1539
01:06:58,351 --> 01:06:58,690
to be the case because a certain amount 
of people are going to go no matter what

1540
01:06:58,691 --> 01:07:03,691
you just said here about all the 
legitimate issues related to trade and 

1541
01:07:03,691 --> 01:07:03,691
government and all that they're going to
go,

1542
01:07:03,691 --> 01:07:06,070
he's racist and Ltl is racist or,
or something along those lines.

1543
01:07:06,460 --> 01:07:07,420
You know,
I don't,

1544
01:07:07,600 --> 01:07:09,810
I didn't cost me any friendships,
um,

1545
01:07:09,840 --> 01:07:10,450
and,
and,

1546
01:07:10,560 --> 01:07:12,890
and,
but the probably were,

1547
01:07:13,140 --> 01:07:15,490
there were,
there were some set of people that,

1548
01:07:15,570 --> 01:07:16,780
um,
you know,

1549
01:07:16,810 --> 01:07:19,570
where they were mad at me that had not 
been mad at me before.

1550
01:07:19,570 --> 01:07:20,830
And,
you know,

1551
01:07:20,860 --> 01:07:22,810
that's unfortunate.
Uh,

1552
01:07:22,811 --> 01:07:25,090
I don't,
I don't,

1553
01:07:25,150 --> 01:07:27,250
um,
you know,

1554
01:07:27,300 --> 01:07:32,300
I,
I didn't think it was that 

1555
01:07:32,300 --> 01:07:32,300
controversial,
you know,

1556
01:07:32,320 --> 01:07:33,740
sort of,
I sort of like,

1557
01:07:33,890 --> 01:07:34,750
like in one,
in one way,

1558
01:07:34,751 --> 01:07:36,820
it was one of the least contrary of the 
things I've ever done.

1559
01:07:36,850 --> 01:07:39,280
It was like half the country.
It's not that contrarian.

1560
01:07:39,400 --> 01:07:41,750
Right.
I've heard you say that the valley,

1561
01:07:41,800 --> 01:07:43,900
it felt really contrarian,
but,

1562
01:07:43,901 --> 01:07:44,560
um,
but,

1563
01:07:44,561 --> 01:07:46,340
so that's,
that's sort of why you,

1564
01:07:46,370 --> 01:07:51,370
you're,
if you're doing something that half the 

1565
01:07:51,370 --> 01:07:53,140
country agrees with you on that,
it's kind of weird for that to be beyond

1566
01:07:53,141 --> 01:07:53,950
the Pale.
I mean,

1567
01:07:53,951 --> 01:07:55,450
maybe it is,
that's actually hilarious,

1568
01:07:56,240 --> 01:08:01,240
least contrary and move in a way.
The least contouring thing I've done.

1569
01:08:01,631 --> 01:08:02,860
And so,
so,

1570
01:08:02,861 --> 01:08:03,370
uh,
it,

1571
01:08:03,460 --> 01:08:04,110
it,
uh,

1572
01:08:04,360 --> 01:08:06,010
it,
it's kind of,

1573
01:08:06,540 --> 01:08:08,020
um,
you know,

1574
01:08:08,021 --> 01:08:08,750
uh,
but,

1575
01:08:08,790 --> 01:08:12,670
but there is something about the 
politics that's intense.

1576
01:08:13,120 --> 01:08:15,830
It felt zero sum for a long time.

1577
01:08:16,160 --> 01:08:17,660
Um,
and you know,

1578
01:08:17,661 --> 01:08:19,430
it is polarized.
It's extreme.

1579
01:08:19,431 --> 01:08:22,010
We don't know what the answers are.
And so there are,

1580
01:08:22,120 --> 01:08:23,700
there are ways that it's been,
um,

1581
01:08:23,940 --> 01:08:26,780
it's been weaponized that are,
that are not always,

1582
01:08:26,990 --> 01:08:28,420
not always healthy.
So I,

1583
01:08:28,730 --> 01:08:29,240
I,
uh,

1584
01:08:29,600 --> 01:08:34,600
you know,
I don't think we're going to go back to 

1585
01:08:34,600 --> 01:08:34,600
the status quo ante unfortunately.
Fortunately or unfortunately,

1586
01:08:34,600 --> 01:08:36,560
that's just sort of gone with the wind.
So not we're not going back,

1587
01:08:36,590 --> 01:08:37,860
you know,
it's uh,

1588
01:08:38,820 --> 01:08:41,070
and it's,
it's quite possible we're gonna,

1589
01:08:41,520 --> 01:08:46,520
you know,
have sort of ever more intense politics 

1590
01:08:46,520 --> 01:08:49,961
for quite some time in one of my 
colleagues coined this term about a 

1591
01:08:49,961 --> 01:08:50,070
decade ago that,
um,

1592
01:08:50,530 --> 01:08:52,430
you know,
something was John,

1593
01:08:52,730 --> 01:08:55,220
Jim Cramer,
the crazy person on CNBC.

1594
01:08:55,670 --> 01:08:57,920
He has this line where there's always a 
bull market somewhere.

1595
01:08:57,921 --> 01:08:59,900
You have to just look for gift,
know where to find it.

1596
01:09:00,350 --> 01:09:02,730
And then the bull market,
uh,

1597
01:09:02,840 --> 01:09:06,290
my colleague suggested this was around 
2008 that was getting started,

1598
01:09:06,680 --> 01:09:10,610
was a bull market in politics and which 
is not a,

1599
01:09:10,670 --> 01:09:13,010
not necessarily a place where you want 
there to be a bull market,

1600
01:09:13,400 --> 01:09:14,000
but,
uh,

1601
01:09:14,060 --> 01:09:19,060
but I think,
I think we are in this sort of bull 

1602
01:09:19,060 --> 01:09:19,640
market in politics and uh,
and it,

1603
01:09:19,850 --> 01:09:24,500
it still has no end in sight and we're 
going to be looking for,

1604
01:09:24,800 --> 01:09:29,800
um,
options that are further outside the 

1605
01:09:29,800 --> 01:09:29,800
box.

1606
01:09:29,800 --> 01:09:30,710
And uh,
and the debate may be,

1607
01:09:30,900 --> 01:09:33,830
it may be even more intense the in the 
years ahead than it has been.

1608
01:09:33,860 --> 01:09:34,610
It's been before.

1609
01:09:34,880 --> 01:09:39,880
Alright.
I think that's enough about trump for 

1610
01:09:39,880 --> 01:09:41,730
now.
I have a feeling he'll probably appear 

1611
01:09:41,730 --> 01:09:41,730
again,
but let's talk about sensemaking because

1612
01:09:41,730 --> 01:09:46,331
Eric Weinstein,
who I guess is the architect of the 

1613
01:09:46,331 --> 01:09:48,200
intellectual dark web,
who is the,

1614
01:09:48,350 --> 01:09:53,350
what is his title?
He is the managing director of deal 

1615
01:09:53,350 --> 01:09:53,350
capitals,
man of many hats.

1616
01:09:53,350 --> 01:09:54,620
A man of many hats.
Okay.

1617
01:09:54,621 --> 01:09:58,400
So one of the ideas that he has 
discussed many times in this very studio

1618
01:09:58,820 --> 01:10:03,820
is that what's happening right now is 
that our sensemaking or communal sense 

1619
01:10:03,820 --> 01:10:07,831
making in America is just failing,
that our ability to trust the media or 

1620
01:10:07,831 --> 01:10:12,461
CNN or New York Times or the rest of it 
has failed to the point that this 

1621
01:10:12,461 --> 01:10:13,700
intellectual,
dark web,

1622
01:10:13,701 --> 01:10:16,940
this crew of about 20 or so people,
uh,

1623
01:10:17,630 --> 01:10:22,630
are the last bastion of our ability to 
just make sense of things or at least 

1624
01:10:22,671 --> 01:10:23,810
try to make sense of things.

1625
01:10:24,050 --> 01:10:27,890
So I have a couple of questions on this,
but first Eric works for you.

1626
01:10:27,891 --> 01:10:30,800
You guys have major disagreements.
He was a Bernie guy.

1627
01:10:30,801 --> 01:10:35,801
You obviously supported trump a,
I'm sure he's been on these shows and 

1628
01:10:35,801 --> 01:10:37,760
talked about probably policies that you 
don't agree with and things like that.

1629
01:10:38,180 --> 01:10:40,790
Yet you let this guy do whatever he 
wants.

1630
01:10:40,791 --> 01:10:44,180
I think that's a great credit to you,
but why?

1631
01:10:44,260 --> 01:10:45,760
Why do you do it?
I mean,

1632
01:10:45,770 --> 01:10:50,770
why do you let this guy run around and 
do whatever he wants to do even when 

1633
01:10:50,770 --> 01:10:51,980
it's in conflict with what you believe?
I don't think most people would do that.

1634
01:10:52,410 --> 01:10:52,740
Well,
I'm,

1635
01:10:52,800 --> 01:10:57,240
I'm interested in ideas always.
And I think that,

1636
01:10:57,241 --> 01:11:00,750
uh,
I don't think all the ideas are,

1637
01:11:00,850 --> 01:11:03,660
are just the conventional ideas.
I think there are.

1638
01:11:04,490 --> 01:11:07,350
I think that I think we need to find new
ideas,

1639
01:11:07,560 --> 01:11:09,630
new ways of approaching the world,
thinking about it.

1640
01:11:10,110 --> 01:11:15,110
And um,
and Eric is certainly absolutely first 

1641
01:11:15,110 --> 01:11:17,130
grade,
heterodox thinker and uh,

1642
01:11:17,490 --> 01:11:19,110
and you know,
I don't think,

1643
01:11:19,550 --> 01:11:24,550
and I think all of our politics are 
somewhat eclectic and somewhat complex 

1644
01:11:24,550 --> 01:11:24,980
and you know,
and uh,

1645
01:11:25,020 --> 01:11:26,190
you know,
Eric is more on the left.

1646
01:11:26,191 --> 01:11:27,510
I'm more on the right,
but uh,

1647
01:11:27,960 --> 01:11:28,560
but,
uh,

1648
01:11:28,740 --> 01:11:33,740
we,
we both interested in ideas were 

1649
01:11:33,740 --> 01:11:34,620
interesting to figuring out how to make 
sense of our world and uh,

1650
01:11:35,160 --> 01:11:40,160
and that unites us and it's always 
surprising how that's a pretty unusual 

1651
01:11:40,860 --> 01:11:43,020
place to be there.
It's much of,

1652
01:11:43,021 --> 01:11:44,400
it's not about ideas.
It's,

1653
01:11:44,401 --> 01:11:47,580
as we said earlier,
it's about power or fashion or something

1654
01:11:47,581 --> 01:11:48,000
like that.

1655
01:11:48,180 --> 01:11:53,180
But,
but most guys in your position wouldn't 

1656
01:11:53,180 --> 01:11:54,810
be allowing one of their top people to 
be out there often taking positions that

1657
01:11:54,811 --> 01:11:59,811
are against them,
that there's something about you that's 

1658
01:11:59,811 --> 01:11:59,811
allowing you to do that.
Right?

1659
01:11:59,811 --> 01:11:59,811
You know,
I,

1660
01:12:00,220 --> 01:12:01,710
I,
I know you don't want to,

1661
01:12:01,711 --> 01:12:03,390
I know you don't want to sit here and 
pat yourself on the back,

1662
01:12:03,391 --> 01:12:06,540
but I think it's an important piece of 
something I think,

1663
01:12:06,860 --> 01:12:08,430
um,
and I'm not sure I'm right about this,

1664
01:12:08,431 --> 01:12:08,920
but let me go,
let me,

1665
01:12:08,990 --> 01:12:10,590
let me be a little bit more modest than 
us,

1666
01:12:10,591 --> 01:12:15,591
but I think most,
most of my peers in silicon valley,

1667
01:12:17,330 --> 01:12:19,920
I think that the ideas are,
are more set.

1668
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:23,160
We sort of know all the right answers 
and it's inefficient.

1669
01:12:23,190 --> 01:12:27,000
It's a waste of time to be exploring 
outside of that.

1670
01:12:27,290 --> 01:12:28,580
And,
and so the,

1671
01:12:28,630 --> 01:12:30,570
the sort of,
the substantive question you have to ask

1672
01:12:30,571 --> 01:12:32,880
is,
are the ideas right?

1673
01:12:33,360 --> 01:12:35,760
Or you know,
should we have more exploration?

1674
01:12:35,761 --> 01:12:36,520
So it's like,
you know,

1675
01:12:36,740 --> 01:12:38,610
you take the,
take the climate change debate,

1676
01:12:38,990 --> 01:12:39,950
there's,
there's a view that,

1677
01:12:40,110 --> 01:12:41,480
you know,
we know it's happening.

1678
01:12:41,481 --> 01:12:42,630
We are,
we go to the agenda.

1679
01:12:42,960 --> 01:12:43,940
We know that,
uh,

1680
01:12:44,430 --> 01:12:47,770
it's a runaway problem and um,
and uh,

1681
01:12:47,810 --> 01:12:49,230
and if we,
we can't,

1682
01:12:49,260 --> 01:12:52,970
we can't even pause and think about it 
because we know all these things.

1683
01:12:52,980 --> 01:12:55,860
We have to just focus all our energy on,
on solving them.

1684
01:12:56,310 --> 01:13:00,210
And so if those things are true,
then that might be reasonable.

1685
01:13:00,720 --> 01:13:02,910
If they're,
if they're not entirely true,

1686
01:13:03,380 --> 01:13:06,120
like maybe you know,
maybe maybe climate change is maybe it's

1687
01:13:06,121 --> 01:13:11,121
more methane and carbon dioxide,
in which case maybe eating steak is 

1688
01:13:11,121 --> 01:13:15,261
worse than driving a car.
So maybe maybe climate change is a 

1689
01:13:15,261 --> 01:13:18,321
problem.
It's a little different from the way we 

1690
01:13:18,321 --> 01:13:18,321
think it is.
And so if these things are not true,

1691
01:13:18,321 --> 01:13:18,810
then we need to have much more of a 
debate.

1692
01:13:19,260 --> 01:13:24,260
And so the kind of question,
and that's very hard that you have to 

1693
01:13:24,260 --> 01:13:27,350
make some judgment on us.
Do we more or less have the truth about 

1694
01:13:27,350 --> 01:13:27,790
everything or don't we?
Yeah,

1695
01:13:27,960 --> 01:13:32,430
and my views that were really far off 
and I think a lot of my peers think,

1696
01:13:32,460 --> 01:13:35,220
you know,
you were kind of at the end of history,

1697
01:13:35,400 --> 01:13:37,290
we sort of figured everything out.
There's,

1698
01:13:37,450 --> 01:13:40,890
we don't want to belong ideas,
we don't want to be an interesting,

1699
01:13:40,891 --> 01:13:43,800
weird ideas are just wrong and they're 
just a waste of time.

1700
01:13:44,010 --> 01:13:45,810
And that's,
that's sort of their bias.

1701
01:13:45,900 --> 01:13:46,680
Mine's the opposite.

1702
01:13:46,800 --> 01:13:51,210
Yeah.
Do you think that this set of people,

1703
01:13:51,300 --> 01:13:54,030
and I think I would include you in that 
in a broader sense.

1704
01:13:54,031 --> 01:13:55,710
I mean,
now you're sitting here and doing this,

1705
01:13:56,220 --> 01:14:01,220
um,
do you think we have a chance of 

1706
01:14:01,220 --> 01:14:01,220
resetting some of this stuff?
I mean,

1707
01:14:01,220 --> 01:14:01,770
I think that just,
if you look in the last week,

1708
01:14:01,771 --> 01:14:03,150
I mean,
alon going on Rogan,

1709
01:14:03,151 --> 01:14:06,780
you're sitting down here again without 
patting myself on the back from them.

1710
01:14:06,820 --> 01:14:11,820
Like I view that as like a landscape 
change of the way people

1711
01:14:12,430 --> 01:14:16,150
that are influencers are visionaries are
reacting to media.

1712
01:14:16,360 --> 01:14:17,870
I think.
Yeah,

1713
01:14:18,250 --> 01:14:18,760
look,
I think,

1714
01:14:18,880 --> 01:14:20,410
look,
I think the boxes are too narrow,

1715
01:14:20,640 --> 01:14:21,660
you know,
it's like,

1716
01:14:22,770 --> 01:14:26,320
you know,
it's like the baby boomer since 1968,

1717
01:14:26,710 --> 01:14:29,380
they'd been re litigating 1968 for 50 
years.

1718
01:14:29,600 --> 01:14:32,830
We've had like the same fights.
They're getting kind of old,

1719
01:14:33,060 --> 01:14:35,620
but it's been been groundhog day for 50 
years.

1720
01:14:35,860 --> 01:14:36,980
And,
um,

1721
01:14:37,340 --> 01:14:37,990
and,
uh,

1722
01:14:38,060 --> 01:14:43,060
and,
and maybe there's something past 

1723
01:14:43,060 --> 01:14:43,810
groundhog day and that's,
that's the bias you have bias I have.

1724
01:14:44,170 --> 01:14:49,170
And uh,
and I think part of it is I'm not just 

1725
01:14:49,170 --> 01:14:51,460
talking about talking about ideas,
it's bringing forth some specific ideas.

1726
01:14:51,461 --> 01:14:53,860
These are things that are different,
that are changing,

1727
01:14:53,861 --> 01:14:55,000
that are,
you know,

1728
01:14:55,030 --> 01:14:58,900
that the world may look very different 
in the future from where it looks in the

1729
01:14:58,901 --> 01:15:03,901
president.
But I think we're not at the end of 

1730
01:15:03,901 --> 01:15:05,791
history.
We're not at a time where ideas don't 

1731
01:15:05,791 --> 01:15:05,791
matter or people can't do things.

1732
01:15:05,791 --> 01:15:07,330
I think the future will be very 
different from the present.

1733
01:15:07,420 --> 01:15:09,520
Maybe it's going to be better,
maybe it's going to be worse.

1734
01:15:09,521 --> 01:15:11,140
It's up to us.
And,

1735
01:15:11,141 --> 01:15:12,250
uh,
and so I'm,

1736
01:15:12,290 --> 01:15:14,260
I'm super long,
uh,

1737
01:15:14,560 --> 01:15:16,930
having a very broad conversation about 
things.

1738
01:15:17,020 --> 01:15:22,020
Yeah,
I'm glad that you brought up the baby 

1739
01:15:22,020 --> 01:15:23,791
boomers from omen because it does seem 
like that partly what's happening here 

1740
01:15:23,791 --> 01:15:25,240
is that they're at their last grasps of 
controlling things.

1741
01:15:25,510 --> 01:15:28,390
And in an odd way,
gen x,

1742
01:15:28,391 --> 01:15:33,391
my generation got,
which I think you're probably right 

1743
01:15:33,391 --> 01:15:34,210
around a little bit ahead of me on Gen 
x,

1744
01:15:35,200 --> 01:15:37,240
that we sort of got lost.
And then we,

1745
01:15:37,241 --> 01:15:39,790
it's almost like we handed everything 
off to the millennials,

1746
01:15:39,791 --> 01:15:42,340
but we didn't give them any of the tools
to be able.

1747
01:15:42,341 --> 01:15:44,380
They were too young and didn't have the 
tools or the,

1748
01:15:44,560 --> 01:15:47,500
or the financial instruments to be able 
to make any change.

1749
01:15:47,500 --> 01:15:52,500
Does that,
does that mean there are a lot of 

1750
01:15:52,500 --> 01:15:52,990
strange generational dynamics one could,
one could talk about.

1751
01:15:53,000 --> 01:15:56,130
I had been very struck in recent months 
and thinking about this,

1752
01:15:56,140 --> 01:15:59,780
how there is something very odd in terms
of what happened to gen x,

1753
01:15:59,960 --> 01:16:04,780
which is people born say 19,
65 to 1980 was the birth years.

1754
01:16:05,140 --> 01:16:10,120
Boomers were sort of 46 to 64 and,
and somehow,

1755
01:16:10,260 --> 01:16:13,300
you know,
the boomers dominated things like crazy.

1756
01:16:14,020 --> 01:16:15,790
And uh,
and there was,

1757
01:16:16,170 --> 01:16:21,070
we were sort of like in the shadow of 
these people and all sorts of different,

1758
01:16:21,071 --> 01:16:23,260
uh,
in all sorts of different contexts.

1759
01:16:23,320 --> 01:16:26,470
And it was,
it was gen x was probably the first time

1760
01:16:26,620 --> 01:16:30,250
that you had a generation that was 
smaller in numbers and the one that came

1761
01:16:30,490 --> 01:16:31,960
before us,
um,

1762
01:16:32,450 --> 01:16:37,450
you know,
it sort of coincided with an era of 

1763
01:16:37,450 --> 01:16:39,220
slower growth,
slower progress.

1764
01:16:39,310 --> 01:16:44,310
So there was sort of fewer opportunities
to rise of baby boomers held onto their 

1765
01:16:44,310 --> 01:16:44,560
positions.

1766
01:16:44,890 --> 01:16:45,970
And in some ways,
you know,

1767
01:16:46,050 --> 01:16:51,050
like when I,
when I started working in a law firm in 

1768
01:16:51,050 --> 01:16:51,050
Manhattan in the early nineties,
I mean always,

1769
01:16:51,050 --> 01:16:51,050
I wasn't thinking of it consciously this
way,

1770
01:16:51,050 --> 01:16:55,561
but it was the baby boomer partners.
They just become partner and they were 

1771
01:16:55,561 --> 01:16:59,671
sort of pulling the ladder up behind 
them and it was going to be much harder 

1772
01:16:59,671 --> 01:16:59,671
for people.
My generation,

1773
01:16:59,671 --> 01:17:04,330
our generation to do the same things,
to go down the track and the same in the

1774
01:17:04,331 --> 01:17:06,400
same way.
And so there is something,

1775
01:17:06,540 --> 01:17:09,980
there is something very weird about how,
how gen x

1776
01:17:09,980 --> 01:17:11,450
has gotten,
um,

1777
01:17:12,100 --> 01:17:17,100
you know,
has been sort of sidelined by the 

1778
01:17:17,100 --> 01:17:17,100
boomers for so long.
And then the,

1779
01:17:17,100 --> 01:17:19,660
you know,
the wrap on us is always that we're,

1780
01:17:19,810 --> 01:17:21,020
you know,
we're too,

1781
01:17:21,021 --> 01:17:23,180
uh,
too young or too old.

1782
01:17:23,660 --> 01:17:28,660
Right.
And so we were in the nineties when gen 

1783
01:17:28,660 --> 01:17:29,840
x was starting to tech companies.
We were seen as too young.

1784
01:17:30,200 --> 01:17:32,690
We needed adult supervision.
We needed the baby boomers to,

1785
01:17:32,720 --> 01:17:37,720
to run the companies.
That's an almost every gen x of founder 

1786
01:17:37,720 --> 01:17:40,640
and some exceptions,
but overwhelmingly the boomers took over

1787
01:17:40,641 --> 01:17:45,641
the company.
There was a version this with Yahoo and 

1788
01:17:45,641 --> 01:17:45,641
Ebay,
netscape,

1789
01:17:45,860 --> 01:17:50,860
even Google,
which was the biggest of the gen x 

1790
01:17:50,860 --> 01:17:50,860
companies.
Uh,

1791
01:17:50,860 --> 01:17:55,220
you know,
you got a 10 year period where Eric 

1792
01:17:55,220 --> 01:17:55,220
Schmidt,
the baby boomer took over,

1793
01:17:55,220 --> 01:17:56,690
took over Google.
Whereas the boomer companies,

1794
01:17:56,720 --> 01:17:59,330
apple,
Microsoft,

1795
01:17:59,370 --> 01:18:04,370
I'm a Amazon,
Microsoft and Amazon.

1796
01:18:04,640 --> 01:18:06,800
Amazon was just saying people got to run
the whole time.

1797
01:18:07,430 --> 01:18:12,430
And then apple,
a little bit more chaotic facebook 

1798
01:18:12,430 --> 01:18:12,430
millennial company.
They got to run it.

1799
01:18:12,680 --> 01:18:17,680
Gen x not so much.
Do you think that tech is like 

1800
01:18:17,680 --> 01:18:22,601
meritocratic?
It's not supposed to be about culture 

1801
01:18:22,601 --> 01:18:24,080
and voting and stuff like this.
And then I think,

1802
01:18:24,340 --> 01:18:25,880
I think on a Po,
on a political level,

1803
01:18:25,910 --> 01:18:28,280
it's striking how underrepresented we 
are.

1804
01:18:29,560 --> 01:18:34,560
A 20 slash 20 should be,
should be a prime year for a gen x 

1805
01:18:36,380 --> 01:18:38,240
presidential candidate on the democratic
side,

1806
01:18:38,241 --> 01:18:43,241
someone born between 1965 and 1980.
And I challenge you to name me a single 

1807
01:18:44,721 --> 01:18:47,720
plausible genex Democrat,

1808
01:18:48,620 --> 01:18:50,870
like a loser like Cory Booker,
right?

1809
01:18:50,871 --> 01:18:53,270
I mean that's the thing.
Well I think there's several reasons for

1810
01:18:53,271 --> 01:18:55,640
that on the democratic side,
but God depend on that.

1811
01:18:55,900 --> 01:18:56,450
Somehow

1812
01:18:56,580 --> 01:18:58,730
the boomers,
they're there more of them and so they,

1813
01:18:59,120 --> 01:19:02,100
they,
they look like it's truth in numbers and

1814
01:19:02,101 --> 01:19:07,101
it's the baby boomer bubble in a way.
It's always been that the numbers make 

1815
01:19:07,101 --> 01:19:11,601
it right,
that if you have a lot of people it's 

1816
01:19:11,601 --> 01:19:13,791
true and that's kind of what worked.
And so it in the boomers were this 

1817
01:19:13,791 --> 01:19:16,320
unusually big generation and it was just
about them.

1818
01:19:16,321 --> 01:19:20,130
It just about getting consensus and then
you could overwhelm things and that's,

1819
01:19:20,320 --> 01:19:23,280
that's what you had to do.
And I think that's,

1820
01:19:23,760 --> 01:19:25,830
that's sort of coming to an end and 
slowly I wonder,

1821
01:19:25,831 --> 01:19:29,910
do you think there's also just the flat 
out technological component to this that

1822
01:19:29,911 --> 01:19:34,911
we ingenex we're the last generation 
that grew up without all of this tech,

1823
01:19:36,180 --> 01:19:37,950
so I don't know what the exact 
connection is,

1824
01:19:37,951 --> 01:19:42,951
but I remember being in college,
I think my freshman year I remember some

1825
01:19:43,381 --> 01:19:48,381
kid down the hallway screaming,
I'm on the Internet and I went into his 

1826
01:19:48,381 --> 01:19:48,750
room.
I've told this story a couple times.

1827
01:19:48,751 --> 01:19:50,640
I went into his room and it said 
Yankees,

1828
01:19:50,641 --> 01:19:55,641
three royals,
one and it had two pictures at a little 

1829
01:19:55,641 --> 01:19:58,101
bit and I swear on my life I remember 
thinking this is the stupidest thing 

1830
01:19:58,101 --> 01:20:01,881
I've ever seen.
Like we did not grow up with the phones 

1831
01:20:01,881 --> 01:20:02,070
in our pockets.
We didn't grow up connected all of those

1832
01:20:02,071 --> 01:20:07,071
things.
So it almost seems to me there's some 

1833
01:20:07,071 --> 01:20:07,071
connection to that where then the 
millennials came in,

1834
01:20:07,071 --> 01:20:08,100
they so connected

1835
01:20:08,100 --> 01:20:09,870
to all of this.
Then the media,

1836
01:20:09,871 --> 01:20:14,871
because the media wants clicks and 
everything paid so much attention to 

1837
01:20:14,871 --> 01:20:16,260
them that that may be pushed out gen x a
little bit more.

1838
01:20:16,261 --> 01:20:17,400
Do you think there's,
I'm just,

1839
01:20:17,460 --> 01:20:22,260
I'm just doing this cultural history.
It's always many variables.

1840
01:20:22,590 --> 01:20:24,620
Super overdetermined.
I,

1841
01:20:25,010 --> 01:20:27,600
I do think there's,
there's,

1842
01:20:27,601 --> 01:20:32,601
um,
there's something about the millennial 

1843
01:20:32,601 --> 01:20:35,541
vibe that feels more conformist and gen 
x feels less conformist.

1844
01:20:37,021 --> 01:20:38,130
And so,
uh,

1845
01:20:38,420 --> 01:20:40,210
and so one of the,
you know,

1846
01:20:40,500 --> 01:20:43,140
good and bad things about being overly 
connected,

1847
01:20:43,520 --> 01:20:46,130
overly technologically connected is,
you know,

1848
01:20:46,230 --> 01:20:48,930
you get to get to know the score right 
away.

1849
01:20:48,931 --> 01:20:50,790
You get the answer right away,
you know,

1850
01:20:50,791 --> 01:20:53,610
you're supposed to be scared of climate 
change right away.

1851
01:20:53,930 --> 01:20:55,590
Um,
and that's good.

1852
01:20:55,591 --> 01:20:58,770
If it's true,
it's bad if it's a shortcut.

1853
01:20:59,220 --> 01:21:04,220
And so our generation,
you could say it was the last one that 

1854
01:21:04,220 --> 01:21:04,220
didn't take shortcuts.

1855
01:21:04,220 --> 01:21:06,480
And most of the time the boomers learned
to take shortcuts.

1856
01:21:06,540 --> 01:21:11,540
We,
we didn't take as many shortcuts like 

1857
01:21:11,540 --> 01:21:13,941
that.
Millennials have no to take all the 

1858
01:21:13,941 --> 01:21:16,131
shortcuts and it's a good idea to take 
shortcuts in a world where nobody takes 

1859
01:21:16,861 --> 01:21:21,861
shortcuts.
I'm in a world where everybody takes 

1860
01:21:21,861 --> 01:21:22,460
shortcuts.
Um,

1861
01:21:22,810 --> 01:21:27,810
you know,
you have to actually figure out and 

1862
01:21:27,810 --> 01:21:29,360
maybe the shortcut isn't going to work 
and you're actually better off figuring 

1863
01:21:29,360 --> 01:21:29,360
out the other thing.
Oh,

1864
01:21:29,360 --> 01:21:30,660
I love that.
So one way to frame this,

1865
01:21:30,661 --> 01:21:35,661
to be in the boomer era,
the boomers who figured out how to take 

1866
01:21:36,421 --> 01:21:39,180
shortcuts,
a shortcut and politics is,

1867
01:21:39,181 --> 01:21:41,670
I'm not going to figure out what I think
about the issues I'm going to school.

1868
01:21:41,671 --> 01:21:46,671
Look at the polls and the pollsters,
the one who's really running for 

1869
01:21:46,671 --> 01:21:49,770
president and just listening to the 
pollster and that was,

1870
01:21:49,830 --> 01:21:53,970
that wasn't effective boomer technique 
for many years that you just look at the

1871
01:21:53,971 --> 01:21:56,580
polls and if you were,
if you had a better pollster,

1872
01:21:56,790 --> 01:21:59,520
you could more quickly get to where the 
puck was going,

1873
01:21:59,521 --> 01:22:02,610
where the crowd was going and you didn't
need to think.

1874
01:22:02,640 --> 01:22:04,500
You didn't have to waste time thinking 
about stuff.

1875
01:22:04,830 --> 01:22:07,350
And so in a world where very few people 
were doing it,

1876
01:22:07,860 --> 01:22:12,860
that can be a very good strategy.
By the time you get to something like 

1877
01:22:12,860 --> 01:22:14,640
the millennials where everyone's been 
trained to do shortcuts,

1878
01:22:15,840 --> 01:22:20,840
that somehow doesn't quite work.
It vaguely maps onto the tracking 

1879
01:22:20,840 --> 01:22:25,340
because you can think of tracking and 
school tracking professionally is a way 

1880
01:22:25,340 --> 01:22:29,181
to.
It's like a shortcut to a successful 

1881
01:22:29,181 --> 01:22:31,230
career and so the baby boomers who 
stayed on track did quite well,

1882
01:22:31,290 --> 01:22:36,290
so if you didn't tune in,
drop out and the late sixties and it 

1883
01:22:36,290 --> 01:22:39,730
just went to law school and you became a
partner at a law firm that it kind of 

1884
01:22:39,730 --> 01:22:41,250
tracks worked.
By the time we get to the millennials,

1885
01:22:41,370 --> 01:22:43,620
they know all the tracks you're supposed
to do.

1886
01:22:43,830 --> 01:22:45,740
Tracks work less well when everyone 
knows everyone.

1887
01:22:45,960 --> 01:22:48,370
Everyone's doing the same thing,
so it has sort of.

1888
01:22:48,780 --> 01:22:51,450
There are these similarities between the
millennials and the boomers,

1889
01:22:51,750 --> 01:22:54,420
but the lesson that they're,
they're,

1890
01:22:54,450 --> 01:22:56,820
they're,
they're really different in practice and

1891
01:22:56,830 --> 01:23:01,830
it's working really differently so that 
the things that would have worked 

1892
01:23:01,830 --> 01:23:03,000
perfectly for you as a boomer are deadly
if you're a millennial.

1893
01:23:03,240 --> 01:23:03,750
Yeah.
So,

1894
01:23:03,751 --> 01:23:05,980
okay,
so hearing that and

1895
01:23:05,980 --> 01:23:09,250
knowing that our sensemaking is breaking
down and our ability,

1896
01:23:09,460 --> 01:23:11,620
even our ability to just get away from 
all of this,

1897
01:23:11,621 --> 01:23:15,370
what you said before about paying that 
much attention to politics and all that.

1898
01:23:16,090 --> 01:23:19,840
Everyone asks the whole idw crew 
constantly,

1899
01:23:19,841 --> 01:23:21,220
well,
what are you guys going to do?

1900
01:23:21,221 --> 01:23:22,560
And you just said something about,
you know,

1901
01:23:22,570 --> 01:23:23,860
we shouldn't just talk about these 
things.

1902
01:23:23,861 --> 01:23:28,570
We got to do things.
Do you see either a technological answer

1903
01:23:28,571 --> 01:23:32,920
here or a business answer here or 
something.

1904
01:23:32,921 --> 01:23:37,921
And we've talked about this a little bit
privately before and it's been kind of 

1905
01:23:37,921 --> 01:23:40,771
bounced it around,
but like everyone wants some answers to 

1906
01:23:40,771 --> 01:23:43,210
what's going on here with the media and,
and everything else.

1907
01:23:43,250 --> 01:23:44,680
And the pipes,
you know,

1908
01:23:44,681 --> 01:23:47,230
that Google owns all the pipes and all 
of that stuff.

1909
01:23:47,410 --> 01:23:50,080
And I think a lot of people is a default
position is well too.

1910
01:23:50,081 --> 01:23:55,081
We'll fix it because it's like there's 
only a couple people that actually 

1911
01:23:55,081 --> 01:23:55,081
could.

1912
01:23:55,220 --> 01:23:56,570
Well it's,
it's,

1913
01:23:56,630 --> 01:23:57,440
um,
I don't,

1914
01:23:57,441 --> 01:24:00,800
I don't actually quite know what one 
does to,

1915
01:24:00,960 --> 01:24:03,510
to fix the media industry.
I,

1916
01:24:05,090 --> 01:24:06,170
I would say the,
um,

1917
01:24:06,480 --> 01:24:11,480
the thing that I'm always super fixated 
on is the business model questions zero 

1918
01:24:11,481 --> 01:24:13,120
to one book.
Uh,

1919
01:24:13,400 --> 01:24:15,470
the,
the main motif has always,

1920
01:24:15,471 --> 01:24:17,210
um,
that you shouldn't compete.

1921
01:24:17,390 --> 01:24:22,390
You should try to have a monopolies,
tried to do something that you do so 

1922
01:24:22,390 --> 01:24:23,270
well that you have no competition and 
you know,

1923
01:24:23,370 --> 01:24:28,370
the good and bad things about monopoly.
But from the inside you generally want 

1924
01:24:28,371 --> 01:24:33,371
to have a monopoly.
It gets a little bit bad if you become 

1925
01:24:33,371 --> 01:24:33,450
too fat and lazy.
And um,

1926
01:24:33,980 --> 01:24:36,530
and if you didn't ever have competition,
you're really in trouble.

1927
01:24:37,100 --> 01:24:42,100
And you know,
in a way the business history I would 

1928
01:24:42,100 --> 01:24:42,100
tell,
uh,

1929
01:24:42,100 --> 01:24:46,810
the mainstream media is that they used 
to have great monopolies.

1930
01:24:48,090 --> 01:24:53,090
The newspapers had local content 
monopolies and the local monopolies and 

1931
01:24:53,090 --> 01:24:57,971
advertisers because the only way you 
could advertise was through the 

1932
01:24:57,971 --> 01:25:00,750
classified section of newspaper or news 
magazines or you know,

1933
01:25:00,780 --> 01:25:04,430
they're all these sort of,
all these sorts of media monopolies.

1934
01:25:04,490 --> 01:25:09,490
And um,
what technology with the Internet has 

1935
01:25:09,490 --> 01:25:13,091
done is it's opened things up in ways 
that are good for information,

1936
01:25:14,721 --> 01:25:16,100
for,
for learning things,

1937
01:25:16,160 --> 01:25:18,350
but it's very bad for their business 
models.

1938
01:25:19,050 --> 01:25:23,150
And I think this is something they never
really understood.

1939
01:25:23,610 --> 01:25:28,610
And so if you were,
if you were at the Washington Post in 

1940
01:25:28,610 --> 01:25:31,901
the 19 nineties,
if you sort of imagine what the holiday 

1941
01:25:31,901 --> 01:25:32,060
party would have been like,
um,

1942
01:25:32,300 --> 01:25:32,820
you know,
the,

1943
01:25:33,320 --> 01:25:35,270
the owner of the post would have said 
something like,

1944
01:25:35,271 --> 01:25:36,210
you know,
you know,

1945
01:25:36,700 --> 01:25:38,390
we're all,
we're all getting paid,

1946
01:25:39,040 --> 01:25:40,040
you know,
we're doing great.

1947
01:25:40,120 --> 01:25:45,120
Business is doing great.
We have all these talented people that 

1948
01:25:45,120 --> 01:25:45,830
are writing great stories.
And the narrative would be that it was a

1949
01:25:45,831 --> 01:25:48,920
great business because of the great 
work,

1950
01:25:48,950 --> 01:25:52,850
the people there were doing.
And the true story was something like,

1951
01:25:53,160 --> 01:25:58,160
I know you're working for utility 
company and doesn't matter what you do 

1952
01:25:58,160 --> 01:26:01,751
because we'll,
we're gonna make these monopoly profits 

1953
01:26:01,751 --> 01:26:01,751
year after year after year.

1954
01:26:02,030 --> 01:26:07,030
And then when the monopoly story started
to break the story was not the 

1955
01:26:08,391 --> 01:26:10,490
monopolies going away because they can't
talk about that.

1956
01:26:10,510 --> 01:26:12,380
Right?
But the story was rather,

1957
01:26:12,430 --> 01:26:14,120
um,
we don't,

1958
01:26:14,121 --> 01:26:19,121
uh,
we don't know anything about the 

1959
01:26:19,121 --> 01:26:19,121
internet or something like that.
And so I think,

1960
01:26:19,121 --> 01:26:21,770
I think the challenge that a lot of the 
media,

1961
01:26:21,771 --> 01:26:25,610
old media businesses have haven't even 
been described correctly.

1962
01:26:26,210 --> 01:26:29,330
And then it's,
but then it is,

1963
01:26:29,370 --> 01:26:30,320
you know,
it's sort of,

1964
01:26:30,500 --> 01:26:31,980
it sort of plays out in,
you know,

1965
01:26:32,160 --> 01:26:33,590
um,
in,

1966
01:26:33,720 --> 01:26:34,670
you know,
and,

1967
01:26:34,930 --> 01:26:37,130
and,
and you have to figure out some new ways

1968
01:26:37,131 --> 01:26:40,880
to get distribution channels,
new ways to monetize and you know,

1969
01:26:40,881 --> 01:26:45,881
the are there.
I think there will be models for doing 

1970
01:26:45,881 --> 01:26:45,881
that.
But that's the,

1971
01:26:45,881 --> 01:26:45,881
that's the question,
how to do it.

1972
01:26:45,881 --> 01:26:47,000
How do you,
you know,

1973
01:26:47,550 --> 01:26:49,460
you can't go back to the old monopolies 
though.

1974
01:26:49,680 --> 01:26:50,180
Yeah,
we,

1975
01:26:50,210 --> 01:26:51,390
we need some answers.
All right.

1976
01:26:51,391 --> 01:26:56,391
Let's,
let's shift a little bit to some of 

1977
01:26:56,391 --> 01:26:58,111
your,
some of your history because I think a 

1978
01:26:58,111 --> 01:27:00,111
lot of people are a certain set of 
people probably only know you through 

1979
01:27:00,111 --> 01:27:03,780
the gawker prism and every time I read 
anything about Gawker or what happened 

1980
01:27:05,341 --> 01:27:10,341
with you or hulk Hogan it,
it always seemed so distorted the way 

1981
01:27:10,341 --> 01:27:10,980
they presented it,
which is probably very obvious to you.

1982
01:27:11,760 --> 01:27:14,850
But to me it was like you weren't people
because people will say,

1983
01:27:14,851 --> 01:27:18,150
well teal hates the media.
He sued a publication.

1984
01:27:18,151 --> 01:27:21,240
He obviously hates the media and it's 
like,

1985
01:27:21,330 --> 01:27:24,210
actually you were defending the right to
privacy,

1986
01:27:24,300 --> 01:27:27,780
which is something that the media should
be doing in and of itself.

1987
01:27:28,200 --> 01:27:33,200
Um,
what made you want to get involved in 

1988
01:27:33,200 --> 01:27:35,871
this?
You had your own history with Gawker 

1989
01:27:35,871 --> 01:27:35,871
obviously before.

1990
01:27:35,871 --> 01:27:35,871
Yes.
And all that it is,

1991
01:27:36,050 --> 01:27:41,050
you know,
there are all these elements of the 

1992
01:27:41,050 --> 01:27:41,050
story that are of course,
you know,

1993
01:27:41,050 --> 01:27:43,230
sort of look a little bit larger than 
life where you have sort of the 

1994
01:27:43,230 --> 01:27:43,540
sociopathic,
uh,

1995
01:27:44,000 --> 01:27:49,000
um,
Manhattan media company and I think 

1996
01:27:49,871 --> 01:27:52,830
that's kind of our,
our,

1997
01:27:52,831 --> 01:27:57,831
um,
our internal code name for Gawker was 

1998
01:27:57,831 --> 01:28:00,961
the Mbta,
the Manhattan based terrorist 

1999
01:28:00,961 --> 01:28:00,961
organization.
Well,

2000
01:28:00,961 --> 01:28:01,630
you've likened them to al Qaeda before 
and then,

2001
01:28:01,631 --> 01:28:03,160
um,
and then,

2002
01:28:03,510 --> 01:28:04,210
uh,
yeah,

2003
01:28:04,211 --> 01:28:09,211
it was,
it was some crazy story in [inaudible] 

2004
01:28:09,211 --> 01:28:09,211
where they just completely distorted 
things.

2005
01:28:09,211 --> 01:28:12,660
And I was speaking to a reporter at the 
San Jose Mercury News and like,

2006
01:28:12,670 --> 01:28:13,630
what do you think of them?
And I said,

2007
01:28:13,631 --> 01:28:18,631
oh,
they'll kind of silicon valley and say 

2008
01:28:18,631 --> 01:28:19,400
that yes you can because of course you 
get on.

2009
01:28:19,720 --> 01:28:20,320
But,
uh,

2010
01:28:20,380 --> 01:28:21,320
but the,
the,

2011
01:28:22,390 --> 01:28:23,120
the,
uh,

2012
01:28:23,830 --> 01:28:25,750
uh,
and so I think they,

2013
01:28:25,790 --> 01:28:27,120
they were sort of this,
uh,

2014
01:28:27,940 --> 01:28:32,890
and it was in some ways you're all sorts
of things you can say about it were kind

2015
01:28:32,891 --> 01:28:35,530
of crazy and it was super destructive.

2016
01:28:35,530 --> 01:28:38,020
They went mostly they didn't go after 
people like myself.

2017
01:28:38,021 --> 01:28:41,230
They went after people who were 
relatively powerless,

2018
01:28:41,660 --> 01:28:46,660
often just average people,
not public figures in any sense of the 

2019
01:28:46,660 --> 01:28:47,210
word.
Um,

2020
01:28:47,440 --> 01:28:52,440
you know,
Hogan was sort of an in between person 

2021
01:28:52,440 --> 01:28:52,440
had been like a very high profile 
celebrity,

2022
01:28:52,440 --> 01:28:52,650
but,
um,

2023
01:28:52,880 --> 01:28:56,770
was definitely,
it was definitely beating up on a weaker

2024
01:28:56,771 --> 01:28:58,000
person in a,
in a,

2025
01:28:58,070 --> 01:28:58,480
in a,
in,

2026
01:28:58,490 --> 01:29:01,030
in,
in the context in which they did it.

2027
01:29:01,140 --> 01:29:06,140
So it had a,
it had this sort of heroic underdog 

2028
01:29:06,140 --> 01:29:06,550
fighting this,
um,

2029
01:29:06,770 --> 01:29:10,410
this sort of hate factory.
He factory machine.

2030
01:29:10,460 --> 01:29:12,130
I bought her the right way to describe 
it,

2031
01:29:12,300 --> 01:29:13,200
targeted at,
uh,

2032
01:29:13,320 --> 01:29:15,780
at various,
at various people.

2033
01:29:16,110 --> 01:29:17,160
Um,
you know,

2034
01:29:17,760 --> 01:29:18,560
um,
you know,

2035
01:29:18,570 --> 01:29:22,290
we have a first amendment and I believe 
in,

2036
01:29:22,380 --> 01:29:24,250
I believe in freedom of speech.
Um,

2037
01:29:24,320 --> 01:29:25,860
you know,
and of course always,

2038
01:29:26,060 --> 01:29:26,360
you know,
the,

2039
01:29:26,490 --> 01:29:28,590
the,
the Hogan trial,

2040
01:29:29,420 --> 01:29:30,270
although the,
you know,

2041
01:29:30,320 --> 01:29:34,350
the jury trial and the jury trial,
you can always argue the law.

2042
01:29:34,620 --> 01:29:36,330
We can argue the facts.
So the,

2043
01:29:36,750 --> 01:29:37,020
the,
uh,

2044
01:29:37,021 --> 01:29:39,490
the Gawker side argued the law,
which is,

2045
01:29:39,530 --> 01:29:40,050
you know,
we're,

2046
01:29:40,520 --> 01:29:45,520
there's a first amendment and it's 
sacred and we're journalists and we get 

2047
01:29:45,520 --> 01:29:45,720
to do whatever we want.
That's sort of.

2048
01:29:45,800 --> 01:29:50,640
And that was roughly their argument.
The Hogan side of it was you published a

2049
01:29:50,641 --> 01:29:55,641
sex tape that was secretly taken in the 
privacy of a bedroom and those are the 

2050
01:29:56,281 --> 01:29:58,620
facts that has nothing to do with the 
first amendment.

2051
01:29:59,010 --> 01:30:00,750
It might have something to do with the 
fourth amendment,

2052
01:30:00,751 --> 01:30:02,730
which is against unreasonable search and
seizure,

2053
01:30:02,970 --> 01:30:07,020
not just by government,
but also by private people obviously.

2054
01:30:07,380 --> 01:30:09,750
And um,
and uh,

2055
01:30:10,320 --> 01:30:11,400
and uh,
and so,

2056
01:30:11,660 --> 01:30:12,570
you know,
and so yet,

2057
01:30:12,660 --> 01:30:17,660
is there a conflict?
Can there be a conflict between freedom 

2058
01:30:17,660 --> 01:30:19,200
of speech and right to privacy probably 
are cases where in theory there could be

2059
01:30:19,201 --> 01:30:24,201
conflict,
but this was one where it was simply a 

2060
01:30:24,201 --> 01:30:24,201
violation of privacy.

2061
01:30:24,201 --> 01:30:27,210
And I would say it wasn't speech at all 
and then,

2062
01:30:27,620 --> 01:30:28,320
and then,
you know,

2063
01:30:28,750 --> 01:30:32,880
are all sorts of like super agregious 
facts that came out in trial,

2064
01:30:32,881 --> 01:30:33,360
you know,
one of the,

2065
01:30:33,361 --> 01:30:37,440
uh,
one of the reporters and the editors had

2066
01:30:37,441 --> 01:30:40,350
posted the sex tape and he,
uh,

2067
01:30:40,620 --> 01:30:42,140
he had a deposition with,
uh,

2068
01:30:42,180 --> 01:30:43,030
with the,
uh,

2069
01:30:43,380 --> 01:30:44,150
with the,
um,

2070
01:30:45,150 --> 01:30:47,190
uh,
it was a one day long deposition,

2071
01:30:47,880 --> 01:30:49,380
a few years before the trial.
And,

2072
01:30:49,890 --> 01:30:50,400
and,
uh,

2073
01:30:50,550 --> 01:30:51,230
it was,
you know,

2074
01:30:51,390 --> 01:30:52,350
sort of,
you have a lunch break,

2075
01:30:52,380 --> 01:30:53,710
come back after lunch.
Hey,

2076
01:30:53,750 --> 01:30:56,100
j Dilla area came back,
reeking of marijuana,

2077
01:30:56,490 --> 01:30:57,040
which,
you know,

2078
01:30:57,070 --> 01:30:58,020
not,
not against it,

2079
01:30:58,021 --> 01:30:59,370
but I would,
I wouldn't do it on your show.

2080
01:30:59,371 --> 01:31:02,130
I wouldn't do it.
Little of a legal deposition either.

2081
01:31:02,490 --> 01:31:03,680
And then,
um,

2082
01:31:03,820 --> 01:31:04,760
uh,
um,

2083
01:31:04,980 --> 01:31:09,980
you know,
the Lord on our side as to is there any 

2084
01:31:09,980 --> 01:31:12,330
sex tape you wouldn't publish little,
I guess it would involve the child.

2085
01:31:12,360 --> 01:31:13,950
And it was like,
what age child?

2086
01:31:14,440 --> 01:31:18,360
A four year old.
And so when you show that to the jury,

2087
01:31:19,170 --> 01:31:21,090
that's,
that's pretty devastating.

2088
01:31:21,091 --> 01:31:23,730
And so it,
it was one of these things where,

2089
01:31:24,060 --> 01:31:25,760
um,
you know,

2090
01:31:26,050 --> 01:31:27,180
I,
I thought that if,

2091
01:31:27,630 --> 01:31:30,150
if Mr,
if Terry Bollea Hulk Hogan,

2092
01:31:30,151 --> 01:31:33,900
if he ever had his day in court,
it was going to be a runaway effect.

2093
01:31:34,420 --> 01:31:37,430
It was going to be completely run away.
Um,

2094
01:31:37,560 --> 01:31:39,080
and uh,
and that's,

2095
01:31:39,081 --> 01:31:40,020
that's,
that's in effect,

2096
01:31:40,021 --> 01:31:44,140
what happened the last day of the trial.
Charles harder on,

2097
01:31:45,410 --> 01:31:48,060
he thought he thought that the largest 
amount of money you could ask for with a

2098
01:31:48,061 --> 01:31:53,061
straight face was $100,000,000.
And then after seven hours the jury 

2099
01:31:53,061 --> 01:31:55,380
comes back with 115.
And so it was just,

2100
01:31:55,381 --> 01:31:57,600
it was just,
it was just a runaway thing.

2101
01:31:57,601 --> 01:31:59,290
And it was,
maybe it was,

2102
01:31:59,380 --> 01:32:00,040
you can argue

2103
01:32:00,040 --> 01:32:02,320
that it was too much for this one 
person,

2104
01:32:02,321 --> 01:32:04,660
but in some ways it was,
it was,

2105
01:32:04,661 --> 01:32:07,060
you know,
it was a million posts they've published

2106
01:32:07,061 --> 01:32:09,700
over the years that were,
that was what was really at stake.

2107
01:32:09,730 --> 01:32:10,120
Right.
Well,

2108
01:32:10,121 --> 01:32:11,930
I think a lot of people,
the people that,

2109
01:32:11,990 --> 01:32:14,020
that like you and defend you on this,
we'll say,

2110
01:32:14,021 --> 01:32:16,870
well,
this was a defense of free speech.

2111
01:32:16,871 --> 01:32:21,130
It was a defense of just the media 
coming after everybody,

2112
01:32:21,131 --> 01:32:26,131
finding out anything you've ever done,
finding out any access to any picture 

2113
01:32:26,131 --> 01:32:30,331
you've ever sent or any of that.
And we see the way this is sort of 

2114
01:32:30,331 --> 01:32:34,111
infecting everything.
It's not that simple argument to make,

2115
01:32:34,511 --> 01:32:39,070
but the way I would argue is I think,
I think we need to have vigorous debate.

2116
01:32:39,280 --> 01:32:41,980
We need to have people with heterodox 
views,

2117
01:32:41,981 --> 01:32:45,670
be able to articulate things and um,
and you know,

2118
01:32:45,671 --> 01:32:49,330
you can silence people by not letting 
them speak,

2119
01:32:49,720 --> 01:32:54,720
but you can also silence them by if you 
say something that's even slightly out 

2120
01:32:55,331 --> 01:33:00,331
of line,
we're going to send the hate mob and 

2121
01:33:00,331 --> 01:33:01,980
we're going to make up stories about you
and,

2122
01:33:02,030 --> 01:33:02,560
uh,
and,

2123
01:33:02,650 --> 01:33:04,090
and personally destroy you.

2124
01:33:04,600 --> 01:33:09,310
And in a way that was the logic of the,
of the hate factory,

2125
01:33:09,320 --> 01:33:11,260
the scapegoating machine.
That was Gawker.

2126
01:33:11,680 --> 01:33:12,310
It,
uh,

2127
01:33:12,520 --> 01:33:17,520
you know,
in some ways the victims were picked at 

2128
01:33:17,520 --> 01:33:17,520
random and in some ways they were not at
random.

2129
01:33:17,520 --> 01:33:22,381
In some ways they were the 
nonconformists they were the people 

2130
01:33:22,381 --> 01:33:24,340
with,
with views that were sort of heterodox.

2131
01:33:24,341 --> 01:33:26,220
I suspect that's one of the reasons 
they,

2132
01:33:26,560 --> 01:33:31,560
they targeted me and again,
I was not targeted more than some other 

2133
01:33:31,560 --> 01:33:32,210
people hurt even more than I was,
but uh,

2134
01:33:32,400 --> 01:33:33,500
but it was,
it was,

2135
01:33:33,560 --> 01:33:38,560
it was very often people who said things
that were just a little bit outside the 

2136
01:33:38,741 --> 01:33:41,640
zone and then they were destroyed.
And the lesson was,

2137
01:33:41,660 --> 01:33:43,600
was one of silencing.
Yeah.

2138
01:33:43,660 --> 01:33:46,270
So we should talk a little bit about 
them targeting you.

2139
01:33:46,280 --> 01:33:47,920
So they,
in effect,

2140
01:33:47,921 --> 01:33:49,060
they outed you,
right?

2141
01:33:49,120 --> 01:33:54,120
I mean,
is that where they officially the ones 

2142
01:33:54,120 --> 01:33:54,120
that Audi?

2143
01:33:54,120 --> 01:33:54,120
Do you know?
I don't,

2144
01:33:54,120 --> 01:33:56,100
I don't.
I think even that history can be sort of

2145
01:33:56,410 --> 01:33:57,550
contested.
I mean,

2146
01:33:57,551 --> 01:33:59,700
I know you were out privately,
so I think it's hard to.

2147
01:34:00,070 --> 01:34:03,190
I think it was,
it was sort of somewhat in between zone.

2148
01:34:03,470 --> 01:34:04,250
Um,
they,

2149
01:34:04,330 --> 01:34:06,310
they targeted me repeatedly over year.
So it was,

2150
01:34:06,340 --> 01:34:07,480
it was that,
it was,

2151
01:34:07,740 --> 01:34:10,390
it was,
it was various other articles on the,

2152
01:34:10,391 --> 01:34:12,490
um,
and it was,

2153
01:34:12,491 --> 01:34:15,100
of course,
if we talk about outing,

2154
01:34:15,130 --> 01:34:16,600
it's,
it's never,

2155
01:34:17,410 --> 01:34:21,400
it's never a simply factual thing.
It's never,

2156
01:34:21,700 --> 01:34:24,280
Oh,
I'm Peter or David or gay.

2157
01:34:24,930 --> 01:34:26,320
Um,
Fyi,

2158
01:34:27,250 --> 01:34:28,320
it is.
Um,

2159
01:34:28,660 --> 01:34:33,490
it's more like a Peter Teal is gay and 
we have no idea why he didn't want us to

2160
01:34:33,491 --> 01:34:38,491
talk about it and uh,
maybe it's because maybe it's because 

2161
01:34:38,491 --> 01:34:42,311
his parents don't know and they'd be 
embarrassed or maybe it's because he's 

2162
01:34:42,311 --> 01:34:44,350
trying to get money out of Saudi Arabia 
and uh,

2163
01:34:44,420 --> 01:34:47,830
and we don't really,
we don't really know why.

2164
01:34:48,340 --> 01:34:49,480
And so,
um,

2165
01:34:49,600 --> 01:34:54,600
so outing is always the way it worked.
I think it happens actually much less,

2166
01:34:54,941 --> 01:34:59,941
but the way it worked,
I'm always involved a description of 

2167
01:34:59,941 --> 01:35:03,871
someone's sexual orientation and a 
description of how psychologically 

2168
01:35:03,871 --> 01:35:04,010
messed up they were,
right?

2169
01:35:04,160 --> 01:35:05,810
Because they didn't want you to write 
the article.

2170
01:35:06,230 --> 01:35:11,230
And the way I think our society has 
progressed is that the word we have for 

2171
01:35:11,230 --> 01:35:16,230
outing today is something like bullying.
And the question is shifted from the 

2172
01:35:17,091 --> 01:35:22,091
psychology of the person being written 
about to the psychology of the writer.

2173
01:35:23,270 --> 01:35:28,270
And the question is why would you,
why would you do something as nasty as 

2174
01:35:28,461 --> 01:35:29,540
this?
And so there was.

2175
01:35:30,070 --> 01:35:33,110
So that's a pretty powerful.
It's been a very big cultural shift.

2176
01:35:33,390 --> 01:35:35,450
So in 2007,
when they,

2177
01:35:35,990 --> 01:35:36,790
when they,
um,

2178
01:35:37,580 --> 01:35:42,580
when they went after me outing was still
acceptable in 2015 they went after the 

2179
01:35:44,091 --> 01:35:45,740
cfo of Conde Nast.

2180
01:35:46,060 --> 01:35:47,390
Um,
and,

2181
01:35:47,510 --> 01:35:48,110
you know,
again,

2182
01:35:48,111 --> 01:35:50,210
sort of who knows the story was even 
true,

2183
01:35:50,270 --> 01:35:51,050
right?
But,

2184
01:35:51,051 --> 01:35:52,610
um,
uh,

2185
01:35:52,880 --> 01:35:53,510
but,
uh,

2186
01:35:53,600 --> 01:35:55,190
the response was,
well,

2187
01:35:55,191 --> 01:35:57,360
that's an incredibly vicious thing.
Why are you a reporter?

2188
01:35:57,361 --> 01:35:59,660
So vicious,
why are they so hateful?

2189
01:36:00,440 --> 01:36:04,250
What's wrong with you to be.
It was sort of like linked to bullying,

2190
01:36:04,410 --> 01:36:05,420
high school,
bullying,

2191
01:36:05,470 --> 01:36:06,110
all,
all these,

2192
01:36:06,140 --> 01:36:07,560
all these kinds of phenomena.
So,

2193
01:36:07,820 --> 01:36:09,110
so we.
So I think,

2194
01:36:09,111 --> 01:36:09,770
I think,
uh,

2195
01:36:10,040 --> 01:36:11,080
I think things,
you know,

2196
01:36:11,280 --> 01:36:13,370
I think we have actually progressed,
you know,

2197
01:36:13,440 --> 01:36:17,390
transparency doesn't always mean that 
you make things better.

2198
01:36:17,660 --> 01:36:19,340
It's,
it's sometimes it's just,

2199
01:36:19,700 --> 01:36:20,590
it's just,
you know,

2200
01:36:20,890 --> 01:36:23,300
it's just an excuse for,
for attacking people.

2201
01:36:23,330 --> 01:36:28,330
Do you think that in your case that it 
was also directly linked to your 

2202
01:36:28,330 --> 01:36:31,301
politics?
Because if you had been the exact same 

2203
01:36:31,301 --> 01:36:33,581
person,
you are with the exact same resume and 

2204
01:36:33,581 --> 01:36:34,160
it created the exact same companies,
but you had been a lefty,

2205
01:36:34,161 --> 01:36:37,700
you had been playing ball the way that 
they want you to play ball,

2206
01:36:37,850 --> 01:36:39,950
that why would they try to harm you?

2207
01:36:39,950 --> 01:36:44,950
I mean,
in effect they were trying to harm you 

2208
01:36:44,950 --> 01:36:44,950
one way or another.
I think that's why they,

2209
01:36:44,950 --> 01:36:45,500
they do these things.
That's why the,

2210
01:36:45,650 --> 01:36:49,490
the label bully is applicable here.
That to me it's like,

2211
01:36:49,491 --> 01:36:50,840
well,
he's the libertarian.

2212
01:36:50,841 --> 01:36:54,130
He some scary anti government guy.
So how can we get him?

2213
01:36:54,520 --> 01:36:55,250
Well,
it's Adam.

2214
01:36:55,850 --> 01:36:57,440
Do you think that's a fair estimation?
You know,

2215
01:36:57,441 --> 01:36:59,810
it's,
it's probably a factor.

2216
01:36:59,811 --> 01:37:01,240
It's hard to know.
I think.

2217
01:37:01,420 --> 01:37:03,350
I think on some level we were just 
trying to get paged.

2218
01:37:03,351 --> 01:37:04,330
Clothes just sounded.
I mean,

2219
01:37:04,340 --> 01:37:04,940
I,
you know,

2220
01:37:04,941 --> 01:37:05,750
it's,
it's,

2221
01:37:05,751 --> 01:37:06,920
um,
we're still,

2222
01:37:07,230 --> 01:37:11,360
I think you're being too charitable to 
them in a way because you're giving them

2223
01:37:11,361 --> 01:37:16,361
an ideological motive and you're saying 
they were these principled leftwing 

2224
01:37:16,361 --> 01:37:18,390
people who went after,
uh,

2225
01:37:18,440 --> 01:37:23,440
the bad,
right wing power structure that is a 

2226
01:37:23,440 --> 01:37:23,440
principled.
But yeah.

2227
01:37:23,440 --> 01:37:26,330
Um,
and I think they weren't even,

2228
01:37:26,390 --> 01:37:30,500
they were more nihilistic than liberal 
or left wing and um,

2229
01:37:30,590 --> 01:37:31,280
and you know,
you could,

2230
01:37:31,460 --> 01:37:34,190
you could dress up the nihilism.
We're going to blow somebody up,

2231
01:37:34,670 --> 01:37:37,620
we're gonna do some crazy,
um,

2232
01:37:38,120 --> 01:37:43,120
attack on some random person and we're 
going to try to give it some thin 

2233
01:37:43,120 --> 01:37:44,900
ideological gloss.
But I think it was just,

2234
01:37:45,200 --> 01:37:46,640
it was just a,
it was,

2235
01:37:46,880 --> 01:37:51,880
it was like,
it was run as like this crazy sweatshop 

2236
01:37:51,880 --> 01:37:51,880
where,
you know,

2237
01:37:51,880 --> 01:37:51,880
the,
the,

2238
01:37:51,880 --> 01:37:56,130
uh,
the people were paid very little and 

2239
01:37:56,130 --> 01:37:56,130
they were paid based on how many clicks 
they got.

2240
01:37:56,130 --> 01:37:56,130
And so you had to come up

2241
01:37:56,130 --> 01:37:59,910
with crazy sensational headlines and 
then stories that uh,

2242
01:38:00,120 --> 01:38:05,120
you know,
sometimes had a relationship with the 

2243
01:38:05,120 --> 01:38:05,120
truth and sometimes didn't.

2244
01:38:05,120 --> 01:38:08,490
Yeah.
And that has really permeated the 

2245
01:38:08,490 --> 01:38:08,490
internet altogether.
Now,

2246
01:38:08,490 --> 01:38:08,490
I mean,
if I look every week,

2247
01:38:08,490 --> 01:38:09,160
you know,
I'm on tour with Jordan Peterson.

2248
01:38:09,161 --> 01:38:14,161
It's like every morning I wake up and 
it's like somebody writes something 

2249
01:38:14,161 --> 01:38:14,161
awful about him that I know is not the 
truth.

2250
01:38:14,161 --> 01:38:19,081
And it's like they have every interest 
in doing it because he will defend 

2251
01:38:19,081 --> 01:38:19,360
himself bus driving clicks.
Oh,

2252
01:38:19,370 --> 01:38:19,740
I know,

2253
01:38:19,820 --> 01:38:24,820
I will still say that I think gawker was
in some ways a singularly sociopathic 

2254
01:38:24,831 --> 01:38:29,831
bullies and uh,
and it is true that there's a lot of 

2255
01:38:29,831 --> 01:38:32,270
stuff like,
would you characterize,

2256
01:38:32,690 --> 01:38:36,530
I don't think,
I think people discounted more.

2257
01:38:36,860 --> 01:38:38,450
It has less impact.
I think,

2258
01:38:38,600 --> 01:38:39,800
you know,
in its heyday,

2259
01:38:40,160 --> 01:38:44,780
gawker had impact because they were,
they were sociopathic,

2260
01:38:44,781 --> 01:38:47,090
they were bullying and people didn't see
it yet.

2261
01:38:47,540 --> 01:38:50,210
And that's,
that's the devastating kind if you're,

2262
01:38:50,220 --> 01:38:55,220
if you try to bully someone and 
everybody says right away you're a 

2263
01:38:55,220 --> 01:38:56,600
bully,
you might still be a bully,

2264
01:38:56,601 --> 01:38:58,490
but not as not.
You're not gonna be that effective.

2265
01:38:59,630 --> 01:39:00,890
If you're bullying people say,
oh,

2266
01:39:00,891 --> 01:39:02,480
this is just the Internet,
this is Tuck,

2267
01:39:02,481 --> 01:39:05,510
this is the future.
You're going to have cart wash.

2268
01:39:05,540 --> 01:39:10,540
And so gawker had carte blanche for many
years to destroy people in a way that I 

2269
01:39:11,271 --> 01:39:13,820
think has gotten much less effective.
I mean,

2270
01:39:13,821 --> 01:39:15,050
it still happens.
They're still,

2271
01:39:15,270 --> 01:39:20,270
you know,
you can have the hate mob form on 

2272
01:39:20,270 --> 01:39:20,270
twitter,
the sort of still versions of this.

2273
01:39:20,270 --> 01:39:20,280
But,
uh,

2274
01:39:20,460 --> 01:39:21,230
it's,
it,

2275
01:39:21,420 --> 01:39:23,270
it's,
it's much less generative.

2276
01:39:23,510 --> 01:39:24,140
All right,
so let's,

2277
01:39:24,170 --> 01:39:29,170
let's talk about sexuality for a little 
bit because this isn't something that 

2278
01:39:29,170 --> 01:39:29,170
you talk about that often.
We,

2279
01:39:29,170 --> 01:39:30,260
we've talked about it privately a little
bit.

2280
01:39:30,710 --> 01:39:32,820
Um,
well,

2281
01:39:32,930 --> 01:39:33,770
first off,
you're married,

2282
01:39:33,830 --> 01:39:36,290
congratulations.
You got married in the last year.

2283
01:39:37,070 --> 01:39:41,330
How much of your sort of contrary in 
view of the world,

2284
01:39:41,331 --> 01:39:46,320
just the way you see things differently 
do you think is linked to be engaged?

2285
01:39:46,321 --> 01:39:51,321
Because before just the last couple of 
years where I think being gay has been 

2286
01:39:51,321 --> 01:39:55,421
so attached to leftism gay used to mean 
fun or different or politically 

2287
01:39:56,241 --> 01:40:01,241
incorrect and making edgy jokes and,
and being at subversive clubs are all of

2288
01:40:02,061 --> 01:40:07,061
these other things,
whatever it was a and gains were really 

2289
01:40:07,061 --> 01:40:07,250
about the individual.
That was the whole point.

2290
01:40:07,770 --> 01:40:09,530
I'm,
you now are sort of,

2291
01:40:09,531 --> 01:40:14,531
as I said at the top,
kind of the ultimate contrarian and I 

2292
01:40:14,531 --> 01:40:16,910
wonder is there a link between that and 
sexuality,

2293
01:40:16,911 --> 01:40:17,390
do you think?

2294
01:40:17,700 --> 01:40:20,250
I wouldn't,
I wouldn't want to exaggerate and he's,

2295
01:40:20,370 --> 01:40:21,910
and he's such link.
Um,

2296
01:40:22,470 --> 01:40:24,210
and I think,
you know,

2297
01:40:24,690 --> 01:40:27,090
I,
I think of myself as like,

2298
01:40:27,120 --> 01:40:32,120
there were sort of,
I'm always bad at or biography 

2299
01:40:32,120 --> 01:40:32,120
yourselves,
start that fire,

2300
01:40:32,120 --> 01:40:35,790
but I always think of myself as somehow 
I was both.

2301
01:40:36,090 --> 01:40:39,120
I'm a total insider and a total 
outsider.

2302
01:40:39,121 --> 01:40:39,960
So it was like,
you know,

2303
01:40:40,200 --> 01:40:42,480
straight a student,
you know,

2304
01:40:42,481 --> 01:40:47,481
on,
on the elite university elite law 

2305
01:40:47,481 --> 01:40:47,481
school,
elite law firm track.

2306
01:40:47,760 --> 01:40:49,380
Um,
you know,

2307
01:40:49,550 --> 01:40:51,940
it was a bit of a nerd.
I was um,

2308
01:40:52,060 --> 01:40:53,500
you know,
I was uh,

2309
01:40:53,680 --> 01:40:54,160
I was born

2310
01:40:54,160 --> 01:40:56,320
in Germany,
immigrant to theu ,

2311
01:40:56,840 --> 01:40:58,180
uh,
um,

2312
01:40:58,430 --> 01:41:00,880
you know,
the gay thing.

2313
01:41:01,000 --> 01:41:06,000
So all these,
all these ways that I was both an 

2314
01:41:06,000 --> 01:41:07,840
outsider and insider and probably 
there's some way,

2315
01:41:08,150 --> 01:41:09,190
some way,
all this stuff,

2316
01:41:09,460 --> 01:41:10,720
you know,
summed up to,

2317
01:41:11,170 --> 01:41:13,750
to um,
make me less,

2318
01:41:13,930 --> 01:41:17,140
less prone to just believing in the 
received wisdom.

2319
01:41:17,920 --> 01:41:19,200
But I know I,
I wouldn't,

2320
01:41:19,280 --> 01:41:21,840
I would certainly not want to say 
anything remotely like that,

2321
01:41:22,480 --> 01:41:25,560
that gay people have a privileged access
to the truth or,

2322
01:41:25,640 --> 01:41:27,420
or anything like that.
That's that,

2323
01:41:27,600 --> 01:41:29,050
that seems kind of crazy.
Okay.

2324
01:41:29,051 --> 01:41:33,910
So a couple of years ago you go to the 
Republican National Convention and uh,

2325
01:41:34,270 --> 01:41:39,270
you talked about being gay,
which had always been an Athema over 

2326
01:41:39,270 --> 01:41:39,270
there.
What,

2327
01:41:39,270 --> 01:41:39,520
what was the exact line that you had 
said?

2328
01:41:39,730 --> 01:41:40,510
Well,
it was a,

2329
01:41:40,600 --> 01:41:43,690
I'm proud to be gay.
I'm proud to be a republican,

2330
01:41:44,250 --> 01:41:45,970
but most of all I'm proud to be an 
American.

2331
01:41:46,630 --> 01:41:48,580
And uh,
and so it was,

2332
01:41:48,850 --> 01:41:50,380
uh,
it was,

2333
01:41:50,800 --> 01:41:52,270
uh,
it was.

2334
01:41:52,390 --> 01:41:54,520
And so I think it functioned in both a 
way that,

2335
01:41:54,521 --> 01:41:55,290
uh,
you know,

2336
01:41:55,300 --> 01:41:57,510
every American has an identity.
It's a,

2337
01:41:57,600 --> 01:42:02,600
it's not something we should ignore or 
totally diminish and we should not make 

2338
01:42:02,861 --> 01:42:07,861
it all important.
And it was sort of trying to steer a 

2339
01:42:07,861 --> 01:42:07,861
certain,
you know,

2340
01:42:07,861 --> 01:42:08,710
middle course on,
on,

2341
01:42:08,830 --> 01:42:11,500
on identity politics where,
you know,

2342
01:42:11,501 --> 01:42:11,980
it's,
uh,

2343
01:42:12,150 --> 01:42:16,510
I think it's very easy to go too far in 
one direction or another.

2344
01:42:16,570 --> 01:42:20,680
You can even say that you know,
that all identity is fake.

2345
01:42:20,681 --> 01:42:22,390
It doesn't matter.
It's all made up.

2346
01:42:22,720 --> 01:42:24,880
And that's,
I think that's wrong.

2347
01:42:24,881 --> 01:42:26,590
I think there was an African American 
experience,

2348
01:42:26,591 --> 01:42:29,890
there's a female experience,
there's a gay experience and they are,

2349
01:42:29,980 --> 01:42:31,780
they are different.
And then,

2350
01:42:31,781 --> 01:42:32,980
um,
and then of course there's,

2351
01:42:33,320 --> 01:42:36,710
you know,
an equally bad mistake of,

2352
01:42:36,760 --> 01:42:38,470
of,
of making it all important,

2353
01:42:38,820 --> 01:42:39,520
uh,
where,

2354
01:42:39,521 --> 01:42:41,230
you know,
that's all there is,

2355
01:42:41,350 --> 01:42:42,400
that's what defines you.

2356
01:42:42,400 --> 01:42:45,310
And then it ends up becoming more of a 
straight jacket.

2357
01:42:45,340 --> 01:42:45,790
So,
you know,

2358
01:42:45,930 --> 01:42:48,190
the gay,
the gay metaphor that I've used is that,

2359
01:42:48,191 --> 01:42:49,370
you know,
um,

2360
01:42:49,870 --> 01:42:51,760
you know,
you can be in the closet,

2361
01:42:52,330 --> 01:42:57,130
you can be in the ghetto and there,
those are mutually exclusive,

2362
01:42:57,490 --> 01:43:01,270
but I hope they're not exhaustive,
but something in between.

2363
01:43:01,271 --> 01:43:02,980
Right.
Because those two are pretty good.

2364
01:43:02,981 --> 01:43:04,810
Something that's neither,
neither of those two.

2365
01:43:04,870 --> 01:43:09,870
Yeah.
So when you said that would be the 

2366
01:43:09,870 --> 01:43:09,870
closet,
I don't want to be in the ghetto.

2367
01:43:09,870 --> 01:43:12,960
Yeah.
So when you said that line and then got 

2368
01:43:12,960 --> 01:43:12,960
bad ovation,
first off,

2369
01:43:12,960 --> 01:43:17,521
were you,
were you nervous to say that line 

2370
01:43:17,521 --> 01:43:17,521
because that's no small feat just to 
have it in the speech and ready to go.

2371
01:43:17,521 --> 01:43:19,060
Here's your nervous to speak,
you know,

2372
01:43:19,061 --> 01:43:22,060
it was just,
it was like speaking to 50,000

2373
01:43:22,061 --> 01:43:27,061
people or whatever.
It's kind of a strange super adrenaline 

2374
01:43:27,061 --> 01:43:28,600
type experience.
But that particular line,

2375
01:43:28,601 --> 01:43:33,601
I mean,
when you got the applause and there 

2376
01:43:33,601 --> 01:43:33,601
must've been some party that was like,
it worked like,

2377
01:43:33,601 --> 01:43:33,601
or,
or,

2378
01:43:33,601 --> 01:43:37,570
or something has changed or something,
you know,

2379
01:43:37,571 --> 01:43:39,520
I again,
I don't think,

2380
01:43:39,640 --> 01:43:44,380
I don't think the Republicans are that 
anti gay.

2381
01:43:44,410 --> 01:43:47,150
They don't think of that antibiotic.
And I mean,

2382
01:43:47,160 --> 01:43:50,050
I think maybe maybe they were in the 
past,

2383
01:43:50,110 --> 01:43:51,260
uh,
uh,

2384
01:43:51,380 --> 01:43:52,100
but,
uh,

2385
01:43:52,310 --> 01:43:53,930
but,
but it was,

2386
01:43:54,230 --> 01:43:56,570
it was clear that this was not the 
issue.

2387
01:43:56,630 --> 01:43:59,060
This was not the hill they wanted to die
on in 2016.

2388
01:43:59,061 --> 01:44:01,350
And so somebody had to say it.
Yeah.

2389
01:44:01,670 --> 01:44:02,300
So unless I,
it,

2390
01:44:02,310 --> 01:44:02,900
it,
you know,

2391
01:44:03,320 --> 01:44:05,030
it,
it felt a little bit risky,

2392
01:44:05,031 --> 01:44:06,740
but I don't even want to exaggerate 
that.

2393
01:44:07,040 --> 01:44:12,040
I think,
I think it would have been a very crazy 

2394
01:44:12,040 --> 01:44:12,040
thing to say 20 years earlier.
Yeah.

2395
01:44:12,040 --> 01:44:13,360
Alright.
Let's shift to some new ideas.

2396
01:44:13,361 --> 01:44:14,570
How about,
how do you feel about that?

2397
01:44:14,630 --> 01:44:16,010
Absolutely.
Through some new ideas.

2398
01:44:16,370 --> 01:44:19,790
So seasteading is one of the things that
you've been interested in for years.

2399
01:44:19,791 --> 01:44:24,791
This idea that we're going to basically 
create in effect states that are going 

2400
01:44:24,791 --> 01:44:29,621
to be on platforms in the sea that I 
think are sort of going to be 

2401
01:44:29,621 --> 01:44:32,920
libertarian utopias,
or at least that would be the general 

2402
01:44:32,920 --> 01:44:36,371
idea.
It seems like it had a lot of momentum 

2403
01:44:36,371 --> 01:44:36,371
behind it for awhile.

2404
01:44:36,371 --> 01:44:38,300
Then kind of went away.
I think there's some renewed interest in

2405
01:44:38,301 --> 01:44:43,301
it now.
What got you interested in this and 

2406
01:44:43,301 --> 01:44:43,301
well,
where's it at now?

2407
01:44:43,301 --> 01:44:43,340
It,
um,

2408
01:44:43,520 --> 01:44:44,270
it was,
uh,

2409
01:44:44,630 --> 01:44:49,630
Milton Friedman.
I sort of knew Milton Friedman a little 

2410
01:44:49,630 --> 01:44:50,510
bit and his grandson pot Patri Friedman.
I'm like,

2411
01:44:50,660 --> 01:44:53,450
someone got in touch with and um,
and he was super.

2412
01:44:53,540 --> 01:44:57,800
He sort of spearheaded this seasteading 
idea probably about a decade ago now.

2413
01:44:58,370 --> 01:45:01,970
And it was sort of a creative,
different,

2414
01:45:02,060 --> 01:45:03,720
interesting idea.
You know,

2415
01:45:03,721 --> 01:45:08,721
I gave it a small amount of funding.
It wasn't one of the things I did that 

2416
01:45:08,721 --> 01:45:08,721
much with,
but it,

2417
01:45:08,730 --> 01:45:11,960
it's somehow an incredible nurse.
And so,

2418
01:45:11,961 --> 01:45:13,040
um,
and I think it's,

2419
01:45:13,400 --> 01:45:18,400
and it hits such a nerve because I'm in 
this idea of starting a new country or 

2420
01:45:19,191 --> 01:45:23,930
doing something new.
It reminds people that,

2421
01:45:23,960 --> 01:45:28,960
uh,
if we had to design a country from 

2422
01:45:28,960 --> 01:45:29,570
scratch,
we designed the state of California from

2423
01:45:29,571 --> 01:45:31,700
scratch,
it will be so different.

2424
01:45:32,180 --> 01:45:33,370
And um,
you know,

2425
01:45:33,480 --> 01:45:38,480
there's all these sort of super corrupt 
governance institutions we'd clean out 

2426
01:45:38,480 --> 01:45:38,610
and we'd,
uh,

2427
01:45:38,640 --> 01:45:39,210
you know,
um,

2428
01:45:39,710 --> 01:45:41,960
and um,
and so it's a,

2429
01:45:42,180 --> 01:45:44,000
you know,
I'm not sure I called Utopian,

2430
01:45:44,150 --> 01:45:46,520
but it's a,
it's a thought experiment that,

2431
01:45:46,521 --> 01:45:47,260
uh,
that,

2432
01:45:47,261 --> 01:45:50,180
uh,
gets that energizes people and gets them

2433
01:45:50,450 --> 01:45:52,250
to think about things.
I spoke at this,

2434
01:45:52,251 --> 01:45:56,010
I'm free market university in Guatemala 
years ago and um,

2435
01:45:56,660 --> 01:45:57,820
uh,
they told me that the,

2436
01:45:57,990 --> 01:46:02,990
they had free speech on everything,
but the one thing that you weren't 

2437
01:46:02,990 --> 01:46:05,540
allowed to speak about were things like 
seasteading or scarring countries reason

2438
01:46:05,541 --> 01:46:10,541
you weren't allowed to speak about them,
was that if you started people to talk 

2439
01:46:10,541 --> 01:46:11,080
about anything else and it's because,
um,

2440
01:46:11,130 --> 01:46:12,890
it's because it's,
it's always such a,

2441
01:46:13,190 --> 01:46:18,190
such a powerful hook and you know,
there are questions about whether it 

2442
01:46:18,190 --> 01:46:22,151
will be allowed.
So you have to sort of get probably 

2443
01:46:22,151 --> 01:46:22,151
some,
some local promotion.

2444
01:46:22,151 --> 01:46:24,800
There's a question on how 
technologically feasible it is.

2445
01:46:24,990 --> 01:46:29,990
Um,
there's sort of a pilot program that 

2446
01:46:29,990 --> 01:46:30,050
they're working with French Polynesia 
and starting,

2447
01:46:30,051 --> 01:46:33,920
it's still somewhere in the,
in the intermediate stage,

2448
01:46:34,100 --> 01:46:34,610
but,
uh,

2449
01:46:35,060 --> 01:46:40,060
yeah,
you can see perhaps seeing if you can 

2450
01:46:40,060 --> 01:46:40,060
get,
if you can get political autonomy,

2451
01:46:40,900 --> 01:46:42,980
the assumptions you would do things that
are very different.

2452
01:46:43,100 --> 01:46:44,890
I do medical tourism.
You might do,

2453
01:46:45,280 --> 01:46:50,280
you know,
that might be all sorts of offshore 

2454
01:46:50,280 --> 01:46:50,280
banking.
You can do all kinds of that one might

2455
01:46:50,280 --> 01:46:53,490
be able to do differently and um,
and the,

2456
01:46:53,700 --> 01:46:56,100
you know,
the link to a link to,

2457
01:46:56,760 --> 01:46:57,540
to,
um,

2458
01:46:57,960 --> 01:46:59,610
to technology that,
uh,

2459
01:47:00,290 --> 01:47:02,730
you know,
I mean I think he's a,

2460
01:47:02,940 --> 01:47:07,940
you know,
you let a lot of these different micro 

2461
01:47:07,940 --> 01:47:07,940
states bloom and you'd sort of see what 
would come out of.

2462
01:47:07,940 --> 01:47:11,520
But the specific technological,
scientific,

2463
01:47:11,521 --> 01:47:16,521
technological thing that I think could 
come out of some new political 

2464
01:47:16,521 --> 01:47:20,931
arrangements at some point is always 
this question whether we could get new 

2465
01:47:20,931 --> 01:47:22,200
medicines,
new drugs,

2466
01:47:22,480 --> 01:47:23,950
um,
um,

2467
01:47:24,080 --> 01:47:29,080
you know,
could you have something where you use 

2468
01:47:29,080 --> 01:47:33,920
psilocybin or MDM as an antidepressant 
drug or can you get,

2469
01:47:35,220 --> 01:47:36,510
can you get new?
Um,

2470
01:47:37,200 --> 01:47:42,200
can you get a new medical treatments 
through where you sort of break the FDA 

2471
01:47:42,200 --> 01:47:44,850
monopoly on,
on medicine worldwide?

2472
01:47:44,940 --> 01:47:49,560
So basically you would see all of these 
different units sort of having different

2473
01:47:49,561 --> 01:47:54,561
rules that they live by,
kind of as an experiment to see what 

2474
01:47:54,561 --> 01:47:54,561
would work is that,
that's,

2475
01:47:54,561 --> 01:47:54,990
that's one level.

2476
01:47:54,990 --> 01:47:58,710
But then the specific thing that I would
say the general abstract hold,

2477
01:47:58,740 --> 01:48:03,740
the specific thing that I,
I would hope would come out of it would 

2478
01:48:03,740 --> 01:48:06,891
be more scientific and technological 
progress that's too heavily regulated by

2479
01:48:07,260 --> 01:48:11,250
the heavy hand of our existing state and
that there are all these things we can't

2480
01:48:11,251 --> 01:48:16,251
do.
So there's all sorts of things of 

2481
01:48:16,251 --> 01:48:18,291
governance might be better.
It might have different penal system or 

2482
01:48:18,291 --> 01:48:19,290
don't have millions of people who are 
incarcerated.

2483
01:48:19,370 --> 01:48:21,810
There are all sorts of things one might 
do very differently.

2484
01:48:22,040 --> 01:48:27,040
The specific one that I,
that I'm probably most tracked who's 

2485
01:48:27,040 --> 01:48:28,260
this is this question of whether we can 
do new biomedical things.

2486
01:48:28,510 --> 01:48:31,620
Yeah.
So we could do three hours just on this,

2487
01:48:31,621 --> 01:48:33,300
but it's only one more question on this,
which is,

2488
01:48:33,540 --> 01:48:37,290
how do you decide who gets in on this?
How do you decide who can,

2489
01:48:37,320 --> 01:48:39,120
who can live there,
who can be part of this?

2490
01:48:39,120 --> 01:48:41,370
I mean,
this is purely a financial move.

2491
01:48:41,371 --> 01:48:43,050
If you've got enough money,
you're good to go.

2492
01:48:43,200 --> 01:48:48,200
Or do you,
are you trying to build a society and 

2493
01:48:48,200 --> 01:48:51,350
picking all sorts of other people and 
all of those things get you had to make 

2494
01:48:51,350 --> 01:48:52,230
all these decisions,
get to make these decisions,

2495
01:48:52,231 --> 01:48:54,050
you get to make these decisions.
And that's uh,

2496
01:48:54,630 --> 01:48:56,430
and uh,
that's.

2497
01:48:56,960 --> 01:49:01,960
But I think that's always,
that's always sort of one of the 

2498
01:49:01,960 --> 01:49:02,470
foundational decisions in the society 
who,

2499
01:49:02,970 --> 01:49:04,920
who's part of it,
how do we define it?

2500
01:49:05,370 --> 01:49:07,350
And um,
and you know,

2501
01:49:07,351 --> 01:49:10,880
it's,
it can be unfair and oppressive if,

2502
01:49:10,900 --> 01:49:15,900
um,
if you have just one society and if 

2503
01:49:15,900 --> 01:49:15,900
you're not in it,
you're nowhere.

2504
01:49:15,900 --> 01:49:18,330
But if you have,
if you have many of these places,

2505
01:49:18,410 --> 01:49:20,010
that's very different.
Yeah.

2506
01:49:20,011 --> 01:49:25,011
And so the pushback on this is then that
somehow this means you don't like 

2507
01:49:25,011 --> 01:49:27,630
America or something like that,
which is I,

2508
01:49:27,790 --> 01:49:29,070
uh,
uh,

2509
01:49:29,520 --> 01:49:30,160
no,
but I,

2510
01:49:30,480 --> 01:49:35,480
I,
I certainly think that if we have 

2511
01:49:35,480 --> 01:49:35,480
competition governance,
we,

2512
01:49:35,480 --> 01:49:35,480
we could,
we would do a lot better.

2513
01:49:35,480 --> 01:49:35,560
Yeah.
All right,

2514
01:49:35,570 --> 01:49:37,070
so let's talk.
Let's move ahead.

2515
01:49:37,080 --> 01:49:41,520
So a flying cars a lot is against them.
Now.

2516
01:49:41,580 --> 01:49:46,580
He's building an underground tunnel in 
this very city where he out on the fly 

2517
01:49:46,580 --> 01:49:47,470
of cars these days because we had a,
we had the,

2518
01:49:47,490 --> 01:49:48,280
it was a tagline

2519
01:49:48,280 --> 01:49:49,270
we had on our,
um,

2520
01:49:49,630 --> 01:49:50,980
on our venture capital,
uh,

2521
01:49:50,981 --> 01:49:51,800
website,
uh,

2522
01:49:52,120 --> 01:49:52,790
um,
you know,

2523
01:49:52,791 --> 01:49:57,791
they,
they promised us flying cars and all we 

2524
01:49:57,791 --> 01:49:58,660
got was 140 characters sort of.
We've got to 80 now.

2525
01:50:01,000 --> 01:50:02,320
And um,
and so it was,

2526
01:50:02,321 --> 01:50:03,070
it was,
it was,

2527
01:50:03,100 --> 01:50:06,550
uh,
it was more a commentary on,

2528
01:50:06,551 --> 01:50:11,551
um,
on a technology that we were promised 

2529
01:50:11,551 --> 01:50:15,010
these massive breakthroughs that would 
transform the way the world works.

2530
01:50:15,310 --> 01:50:19,680
And then we got sort of incremental 
communication technologies but not,

2531
01:50:20,000 --> 01:50:23,830
not world transforming.
And so I do think flying cars will be,

2532
01:50:24,430 --> 01:50:25,630
you know,
would be a good thing.

2533
01:50:25,631 --> 01:50:30,631
I know,
I think Ellen's objection was they were 

2534
01:50:30,631 --> 01:50:32,161
too,
too noisy and then of course the 

2535
01:50:32,161 --> 01:50:32,161
question is can you design them so 
they're not so noisy?

2536
01:50:32,161 --> 01:50:33,490
So there's always sort of what are,
what are the actual limits on,

2537
01:50:33,810 --> 01:50:35,770
on the technology,
but the um,

2538
01:50:36,520 --> 01:50:40,660
but the sort of iconic for can we have a
Jetson's future?

2539
01:50:40,990 --> 01:50:44,020
Can we have a future where things look 
really different?

2540
01:50:44,050 --> 01:50:49,050
And the striking thing is that we live 
in a world that doesn't look that 

2541
01:50:49,050 --> 01:50:50,140
different from the 19 eighties.
Again,

2542
01:50:50,141 --> 01:50:50,800
the,
the,

2543
01:50:50,820 --> 01:50:51,100
you know,
we're,

2544
01:50:51,120 --> 01:50:56,120
we're looking at screens,
we're distracted by our iphones all the 

2545
01:50:56,120 --> 01:50:59,881
time,
but the iphones that distract us from 

2546
01:50:59,881 --> 01:51:03,001
our environment also distract us from 
the way in which our environment 

2547
01:51:03,001 --> 01:51:07,080
strangely hasn't changed.
We're running maybe writing a 100 year 

2548
01:51:07,080 --> 01:51:08,930
old subway in New York City or you know,
the um,

2549
01:51:09,340 --> 01:51:14,340
the zoning laws mean that the cities 
like San Francisco looked like they 

2550
01:51:14,340 --> 01:51:17,881
haven't changed in 50 years.
Not that technologically advanced San 

2551
01:51:17,881 --> 01:51:18,180
Francisco is getting so expensive.
You had to leave.

2552
01:51:18,181 --> 01:51:20,380
I mean,
that's not the precise reason,

2553
01:51:20,381 --> 01:51:21,130
but,
but,

2554
01:51:21,131 --> 01:51:21,980
um,
but,

2555
01:51:22,110 --> 01:51:23,240
but it basically,
uh,

2556
01:51:23,330 --> 01:51:25,390
so it's sort of like,
can we,

2557
01:51:25,540 --> 01:51:28,690
can we have more technological progress 
than we have?

2558
01:51:29,260 --> 01:51:30,530
And uh,
you know,

2559
01:51:30,550 --> 01:51:31,160
it's,
it's uh,

2560
01:51:31,430 --> 01:51:32,530
the,
the um,

2561
01:51:32,640 --> 01:51:34,210
the sort of iconic image.

2562
01:51:34,210 --> 01:51:39,210
I always have this,
you had the two back to the future 

2563
01:51:39,210 --> 01:51:39,210
movies,
the first one,

2564
01:51:39,210 --> 01:51:42,900
they went from 85 to 1955 and things had
changed a lot from 1955 to 1985.

2565
01:51:46,480 --> 01:51:49,870
The second one,
they went from 1985 to what they thought

2566
01:51:49,871 --> 01:51:51,860
2015 would be like,
and you're going to have like,

2567
01:51:51,880 --> 01:51:56,880
I mean,
all it was going to like this crazy 

2568
01:51:56,880 --> 01:51:59,311
different world.
And I think the reality is the world of 

2569
01:51:59,311 --> 01:51:59,311
Twenty 15,
uh,

2570
01:51:59,311 --> 01:52:03,210
looks much less different from the world
of 1985 and 85 was from 55.

2571
01:52:04,860 --> 01:52:07,130
So waiting for that hoverboard.
What happened to the hover ball?

2572
01:52:07,140 --> 01:52:08,410
All these kinds of things.
Yes.

2573
01:52:08,880 --> 01:52:09,960
And so it's,
uh,

2574
01:52:10,340 --> 01:52:11,620
and so there is sort of this,
this,

2575
01:52:11,621 --> 01:52:13,270
this,
and I think that,

2576
01:52:13,271 --> 01:52:14,200
you know,
one of the,

2577
01:52:14,380 --> 01:52:19,380
one of the ways our society works,
one of the ways liberal democracy or 

2578
01:52:19,380 --> 01:52:24,030
representative government works is that 
you have a scientific technological 

2579
01:52:24,030 --> 01:52:25,180
progress going on in the background.

2580
01:52:25,180 --> 01:52:27,190
You have growth,
the pie is growing.

2581
01:52:27,400 --> 01:52:30,970
If the pie grows,
we can find creative ways to,

2582
01:52:30,971 --> 01:52:35,971
um,
to shift the pieces that everybody gets 

2583
01:52:35,971 --> 01:52:35,971
more.
Um,

2584
01:52:36,160 --> 01:52:39,220
when the Pi stops growing,
when there is no progress,

2585
01:52:39,700 --> 01:52:44,290
then you end up with this polarized 
world with the zero sum politics.

2586
01:52:44,990 --> 01:52:49,990
Know for every winner there's a loser.
Anyone who succeeds is suspected of 

2587
01:52:49,990 --> 01:52:51,560
being part of some kind of a racket or 
something.

2588
01:52:51,890 --> 01:52:52,660
And,
um,

2589
01:52:52,840 --> 01:52:56,030
and so I think I,
I think there is actually a pretty,

2590
01:52:56,031 --> 01:52:57,140
uh,
um,

2591
01:52:57,460 --> 01:53:00,860
there's a link pretty deep link between 
this,

2592
01:53:00,861 --> 01:53:05,861
uh,
the question of scientific and 

2593
01:53:05,861 --> 01:53:05,861
technological progress and,
uh,

2594
01:53:05,861 --> 01:53:07,670
the health of our sort of representative
democracy.

2595
01:53:07,860 --> 01:53:08,540
Yeah.
So,

2596
01:53:08,541 --> 01:53:09,650
uh,
that's a good segue to,

2597
01:53:09,680 --> 01:53:11,810
to Ai,
because we've talked about this a little

2598
01:53:11,811 --> 01:53:13,710
bit and you've told me something once 
that I,

2599
01:53:13,711 --> 01:53:18,711
I,
I'm actually not sure if you've said 

2600
01:53:18,711 --> 01:53:20,141
publicly,
but I think it's pretty on point that 

2601
01:53:20,141 --> 01:53:22,511
basically if you're an authoritarian,
you should be for ai and libertarians 

2602
01:53:23,300 --> 01:53:24,190
are sort of against the.

2603
01:53:24,190 --> 01:53:25,980
I am I,
am I getting that roughly correct?

2604
01:53:25,981 --> 01:53:30,981
Yeah.
I think the best sound bite was on 

2605
01:53:30,981 --> 01:53:32,840
Bitcoin if crypto is libertarian than ai
as communists.

2606
01:53:32,841 --> 01:53:37,841
So everyone thinks of crypto is 
libertarian because you have all these 

2607
01:53:37,841 --> 01:53:39,560
ideas about decentralizing money and 
things like this.

2608
01:53:39,800 --> 01:53:43,040
Nobody says ai is communist and that's 
because we're sort of,

2609
01:53:43,110 --> 01:53:48,110
we're more conscious of people with 
different views like libertarian and 

2610
01:53:48,110 --> 01:53:51,011
were less conscious of people with 
collectivist views because that's sort 

2611
01:53:51,011 --> 01:53:52,260
of the,
that's more the Zeitgeists but uh,

2612
01:53:52,310 --> 01:53:57,310
but yes,
I think ai crypto versus ai dichotomy 

2613
01:53:58,460 --> 01:54:03,460
goes to the sort of question,
what's the future of the computer age 

2614
01:54:03,460 --> 01:54:03,780
going to look like?
And,

2615
01:54:04,550 --> 01:54:08,120
and is it going to be more centralized 
or more decentralized?

2616
01:54:08,150 --> 01:54:11,330
We hit that thing about the history.
We've had these very different pictures.

2617
01:54:11,331 --> 01:54:13,160
So you know,
in the late sixties,

2618
01:54:13,161 --> 01:54:16,130
the early star trek episodes you had,
maybe it was one planet,

2619
01:54:16,160 --> 01:54:21,160
they got to where there was one big 
computer that ran the whole planet had 

2620
01:54:21,160 --> 01:54:24,071
been running it for 8,000
years and people didn't have any 

2621
01:54:24,071 --> 01:54:24,071
thoughts.

2622
01:54:24,071 --> 01:54:25,460
They're all sort of docile,
kind of happy.

2623
01:54:25,580 --> 01:54:30,580
Nothing ever happened.
And that was what people thought the 

2624
01:54:30,580 --> 01:54:33,311
future would be.
In the late sixties when we centralized 

2625
01:54:33,311 --> 01:54:36,401
big computers,
the late nineties it was going to be 

2626
01:54:36,401 --> 01:54:38,390
crypto,
it was going to be decentralized,

2627
01:54:38,391 --> 01:54:43,391
the Internet was going to split up all 
these sort of structures and that was 

2628
01:54:43,391 --> 01:54:48,190
like 1998,
let's sort of let's say 68 with 

2629
01:54:48,190 --> 01:54:49,800
centralized,
98 was decentralized 2018.

2630
01:54:49,850 --> 01:54:53,300
In some ways the pendulum has swung back
to centralize this big governments,

2631
01:54:53,301 --> 01:54:58,301
big databases that can monitor and 
survey people and know more about you 

2632
01:54:58,301 --> 01:55:00,140
than you know about yourself or things 
like that.

2633
01:55:00,141 --> 01:55:03,050
Sort of creepy big brother type thing.
But I think,

2634
01:55:03,370 --> 01:55:08,370
I think since the pendulum has swung 
back and forth so much over the last 50 

2635
01:55:08,370 --> 01:55:13,241
years,
there's no reason that that's the 

2636
01:55:13,241 --> 01:55:13,241
future.
It's actually a choice.

2637
01:55:13,241 --> 01:55:16,991
Do we want it to be centralized?
Do we want it to be decentralized and 

2638
01:55:16,991 --> 01:55:21,920
what,
what I think ai can mean many different 

2639
01:55:21,920 --> 01:55:24,881
things,
but if it means that you have large 

2640
01:55:24,881 --> 01:55:27,050
databases that are controlled by,
let's say,

2641
01:55:27,051 --> 01:55:30,170
a large government that can monitor 
people more effectively,

2642
01:55:31,020 --> 01:55:35,720
it's something that could make communism
maybe more effective,

2643
01:55:35,900 --> 01:55:40,900
certainly more scary,
more totalitarian than it ever was in 

2644
01:55:40,900 --> 01:55:41,500
the 20th century.
And the,

2645
01:55:42,000 --> 01:55:44,070
I do think,
and it's not a coincidence along

2646
01:55:44,070 --> 01:55:49,070
these lines that the Chinese Communist 
Party hates crypto and won't say ai and,

2647
01:55:49,530 --> 01:55:50,440
and again,
you know,

2648
01:55:50,450 --> 01:55:50,950
they,
they,

2649
01:55:51,090 --> 01:55:52,620
ai means something a little bit 
different.

2650
01:55:52,621 --> 01:55:54,470
What it means in a silicon valley 
context.

2651
01:55:54,471 --> 01:55:55,770
We're in silicon valley.
Ai Off

2652
01:55:55,820 --> 01:55:57,080
just means,
you know,

2653
01:55:57,340 --> 01:55:57,890
a,
um,

2654
01:55:58,060 --> 01:56:02,030
a super smart computer that will leave 
all the humans behind in China.

2655
01:56:02,210 --> 01:56:03,720
It means a,
a,

2656
01:56:03,820 --> 01:56:04,170
a

2657
01:56:04,890 --> 01:56:08,430
really smart computer that helps a few 
humans control the rest.

2658
01:56:08,650 --> 01:56:13,650
Yeah.
So it almost seems like we're going to 

2659
01:56:13,650 --> 01:56:15,081
splinter off into two versions of this 
where we'll have these two tracks 

2660
01:56:15,081 --> 01:56:18,621
that'll be side by side.
Half the people are really going to be 

2661
01:56:18,621 --> 01:56:21,411
into this sort of centralized idea of 
things and the ease that ai will allow 

2662
01:56:21,411 --> 01:56:22,860
you to get products or whatever else it 
is.

2663
01:56:23,010 --> 01:56:28,010
And then you'll have this other group of
people who maybe who are into all the 

2664
01:56:28,010 --> 01:56:28,830
cryptocurrencies and all that who are 
just sort of,

2665
01:56:30,110 --> 01:56:35,110
I don't know,
I suppose are operating outside of the 

2666
01:56:35,110 --> 01:56:35,110
system or something like that.
It's,

2667
01:56:35,110 --> 01:56:35,110
you know,
I,

2668
01:56:35,370 --> 01:56:36,540
I think it's,
um,

2669
01:56:37,300 --> 01:56:42,300
it's,
it's possible these things can be 

2670
01:56:42,300 --> 01:56:44,810
overlapping,
but it's also possible can go much more 

2671
01:56:44,810 --> 01:56:47,631
one way or the other that it can be 
ultimately that the future can be more 

2672
01:56:47,631 --> 01:56:48,630
decentralized,
are more centralized,

2673
01:56:48,660 --> 01:56:50,630
it can be more capitalists,
more communist,

2674
01:56:50,640 --> 01:56:53,790
more libertarian,
more totalitarian.

2675
01:56:54,000 --> 01:56:54,690
So,
um,

2676
01:56:54,691 --> 01:56:57,340
so I think it can go and,
you know,

2677
01:56:57,480 --> 01:56:59,110
a lot of different ways and it's an 
info.

2678
01:56:59,210 --> 01:57:04,210
This is why these debates are important 
because it's up to us to decide which 

2679
01:57:04,210 --> 01:57:06,980
technologies do we push and which ones,
you know,

2680
01:57:07,100 --> 01:57:08,350
are we,
are we maybe,

2681
01:57:08,400 --> 01:57:13,400
you know,
I'm going to be a little more careful 

2682
01:57:13,400 --> 01:57:13,400
and I think you should outlaw ai are 
regulated.

2683
01:57:13,400 --> 01:57:13,680
But,
uh,

2684
01:57:14,010 --> 01:57:15,180
but I think that,
uh,

2685
01:57:15,360 --> 01:57:16,590
um,
that,

2686
01:57:16,591 --> 01:57:18,180
uh,
that uh,

2687
01:57:18,600 --> 01:57:21,750
the certainly are other technologies 
that I would like to do better,

2688
01:57:21,840 --> 01:57:26,840
so I know you're not in the well,
what are some of those technologies or 

2689
01:57:26,840 --> 01:57:27,990
something like the mainland,
the contrast example?

2690
01:57:27,991 --> 01:57:32,991
Yeah.
So I know that a huge percentage of my 

2691
01:57:32,991 --> 01:57:35,211
audience just because they know all the 
craziness I've been through with 

2692
01:57:35,211 --> 01:57:38,211
demonetization and I'm always 
complaining about the algorithm and our 

2693
01:57:38,211 --> 01:57:41,031
video's not going to feeds and all of 
these things and that we've just sort 

2694
01:57:41,031 --> 01:57:41,400
of,
we just don't know what's going on.

2695
01:57:41,401 --> 01:57:42,420
You know,
and you know,

2696
01:57:42,421 --> 01:57:47,421
my feelings on this about I don't want 
the government telling these companies 

2697
01:57:47,421 --> 01:57:50,811
what to do,
but I would like a little more 

2698
01:57:50,811 --> 01:57:50,811
transparency out of the,
out of the government.

2699
01:57:50,811 --> 01:57:55,011
I'd like to know what's Kinda going on 
with the algorithms and things like 

2700
01:57:55,011 --> 01:57:58,131
that.
Is there any way we could know more 

2701
01:57:58,131 --> 01:57:58,530
about these algorithms and things that 
are giving us all this information?

2702
01:57:58,531 --> 01:58:02,640
Or is that just there's reasons why we 
can't know all of that?

2703
01:58:03,660 --> 01:58:05,550
I'm not even sure if I framed that 
question correctly.

2704
01:58:05,570 --> 01:58:05,790
No,
look,

2705
01:58:05,880 --> 01:58:10,880
I'm sorry.
I always have to be careful here since 

2706
01:58:10,880 --> 01:58:10,880
I'm on the board and,
and

2707
01:58:10,880 --> 01:58:10,880
um,
and I,

2708
01:58:11,440 --> 01:58:13,020
I,
I certainly think that,

2709
01:58:13,050 --> 01:58:14,270
um,
uh,

2710
01:58:14,740 --> 01:58:15,890
uh,
in my judgment,

2711
01:58:15,891 --> 01:58:16,670
uh,
um,

2712
01:58:17,030 --> 01:58:22,030
you know,
facebook has been given a bit more of a 

2713
01:58:22,030 --> 01:58:22,740
bum rap than it deserves on,
on,

2714
01:58:22,770 --> 01:58:23,980
on many of these scores.
But,

2715
01:58:24,810 --> 01:58:26,250
but I,
I would say that,

2716
01:58:26,251 --> 01:58:27,630
uh,
that I think,

2717
01:58:27,631 --> 01:58:29,320
um,
there is this,

2718
01:58:29,321 --> 01:58:32,340
this question is going to continue.
It's a,

2719
01:58:32,370 --> 01:58:33,030
it's,
you know,

2720
01:58:33,530 --> 01:58:37,230
does silicon valley discriminating 
against certain voices?

2721
01:58:37,231 --> 01:58:41,440
Is it um,
or the algorithms in fact neutral or are

2722
01:58:41,441 --> 01:58:42,310
they coded

2723
01:58:42,310 --> 01:58:47,310
to discriminate against conservative 
libertarian voices that are out a little

2724
01:58:47,591 --> 01:58:52,591
bit outside the mainstream.
And I think Silicon Valley is making a 

2725
01:58:52,781 --> 01:58:57,781
mistake if it thinks that that question 
can be sort of swept under the rug and 

2726
01:58:57,781 --> 01:58:57,810
this is going to go away,
I think.

2727
01:58:57,811 --> 01:59:00,250
I think the question is going to be 
asked with,

2728
01:59:00,280 --> 01:59:01,070
uh,
with,

2729
01:59:01,071 --> 01:59:06,071
you know,
more intensity in the years ahead and I 

2730
01:59:06,071 --> 01:59:06,071
think people are either going to have to
answer it.

2731
01:59:06,400 --> 01:59:07,150
Yeah.
All right.

2732
01:59:07,151 --> 01:59:12,151
So two more for you.
Did you ever think if 20 years ago 

2733
01:59:12,151 --> 01:59:13,350
someone would have said to you,
you know,

2734
01:59:13,360 --> 01:59:17,050
teal in 2018,
you're going to leave silicon valley and

2735
01:59:17,051 --> 01:59:19,030
not only you're going to leave silicon 
valley,

2736
01:59:19,300 --> 01:59:21,970
you're going to go to la for freedom.
You know what I mean?

2737
01:59:21,971 --> 01:59:25,270
You're going to go to La to escape,
to find some free thinkers.

2738
01:59:25,271 --> 01:59:28,540
Now there's something interesting 
happening in La Right now and it goes to

2739
01:59:28,541 --> 01:59:29,950
something that you referenced earlier.

2740
01:59:30,190 --> 01:59:33,910
Politics and media are sort of becoming 
one thing and there is suddenly this new

2741
01:59:33,911 --> 01:59:38,911
home here have kind of free thinkers 
that are interested in politics and all 

2742
01:59:38,911 --> 01:59:42,241
that,
but the fact that you ended up here of 

2743
01:59:42,241 --> 01:59:44,791
all places where this is thought of as 
Hollywood and the liberal lefty elite 

2744
01:59:44,791 --> 01:59:49,260
and all that stuff,
does that seem crazy to you that of all 

2745
01:59:49,260 --> 01:59:50,300
places you're going to end up here now?
I know that way.

2746
01:59:50,330 --> 01:59:52,300
I don't think it would have predicted it
20 years ago.

2747
01:59:52,301 --> 01:59:53,540
Certainly.
Uh,

2748
01:59:54,370 --> 01:59:55,120
I think,
uh,

2749
01:59:55,150 --> 02:00:00,150
you know,
I think there's a lot of different 

2750
02:00:00,150 --> 02:00:00,680
reasons when a chooses to live in place,
probably like bigger cities is something

2751
02:00:00,690 --> 02:00:03,130
that is sort of a lot,
a lot of things you can do in big cities

2752
02:00:03,131 --> 02:00:05,290
you can't do.
And in smaller places.

2753
02:00:05,650 --> 02:00:10,650
One of the,
one of the things that our is a very 

2754
02:00:10,650 --> 02:00:11,440
different field between Los Angeles and 
Silicon Valley.

2755
02:00:12,310 --> 02:00:15,520
Is that a Los Angeles is,
it is a weirdly,

2756
02:00:15,660 --> 02:00:20,660
it is the big city that is weirdly 
decentralized and it doesn't have a 

2757
02:00:20,660 --> 02:00:21,740
center.
Um,

2758
02:00:21,790 --> 02:00:26,790
you know,
people always complained about how bad 

2759
02:00:26,790 --> 02:00:26,790
the traffic is.
But uh,

2760
02:00:26,790 --> 02:00:28,360
one of the virtues of it is it's somehow
it isn't.

2761
02:00:28,450 --> 02:00:29,470
It isn't like this,
uh,

2762
02:00:29,830 --> 02:00:34,830
this intense manic,
a bubble like Manhattan or like a San 

2763
02:00:35,050 --> 02:00:37,510
Francisco in silicon valley have become.
And so,

2764
02:00:37,511 --> 02:00:40,420
um,
the superintendent's network effects you

2765
02:00:40,421 --> 02:00:45,421
have in Manhattan,
and I'm in Silicon Valley can be very 

2766
02:00:45,421 --> 02:00:48,220
positive because it's like you sort of 
communicate things,

2767
02:00:48,221 --> 02:00:51,310
you get ideas,
but then at some point you get a tipping

2768
02:00:52,150 --> 02:00:53,410
point,
gets crossed.

2769
02:00:53,620 --> 02:00:55,690
Where it goes with,
becomes more negative,

2770
02:00:55,780 --> 02:00:58,960
becomes group think loving like 
behavior.

2771
02:00:59,080 --> 02:01:04,080
The Madness of crowds and uh,
and my judgment is somehow a silicon 

2772
02:01:04,080 --> 02:01:04,810
valley's,
you know,

2773
02:01:05,110 --> 02:01:07,710
jumped the shark just a little bit over 
the last few years that,

2774
02:01:07,711 --> 02:01:08,300
uh,
that,

2775
02:01:08,370 --> 02:01:13,370
uh,
the very things that were positive got 

2776
02:01:13,370 --> 02:01:14,320
pushed so far till they actually became 
poisonous.

2777
02:01:14,410 --> 02:01:19,410
Yeah.
Do you think you get more support 

2778
02:01:19,410 --> 02:01:19,410
privately from some of your colleagues 
then?

2779
02:01:19,410 --> 02:01:20,890
Maybe publicly on something like that?
Like where people,

2780
02:01:21,010 --> 02:01:22,930
other ceos calling you and going to,
you know,

2781
02:01:23,350 --> 02:01:28,350
I get it too.
I'm having trouble hiring qualified 

2782
02:01:28,350 --> 02:01:28,350
people because of all of.
Oh,

2783
02:01:28,350 --> 02:01:28,350
absolutely.
There's,

2784
02:01:28,350 --> 02:01:30,560
there's an economic look,
the whole bunch of reasons.

2785
02:01:30,670 --> 02:01:31,780
There's the,
you know,

2786
02:01:31,781 --> 02:01:32,740
the,
the,

2787
02:01:32,800 --> 02:01:33,610
um,
the,

2788
02:01:33,611 --> 02:01:34,320
the,
the,

2789
02:01:34,510 --> 02:01:39,190
the reductionist economic reason that 
things have gotten less desirable.

2790
02:01:39,230 --> 02:01:40,010
Silicon Valley has gotten

2791
02:01:40,010 --> 02:01:42,380
too expensive.
If it's $2,000

2792
02:01:42,381 --> 02:01:45,980
for one bedroom apartment,
maybe that's like a boom town and that's

2793
02:01:46,040 --> 02:01:48,860
showing things are going well.
If it's $4,000,

2794
02:01:49,040 --> 02:01:53,270
that's like just a crazy tax that maybe 
should think twice about paying.

2795
02:01:53,840 --> 02:01:54,680
And so,
um,

2796
02:01:54,830 --> 02:01:55,940
so yes,
I think that,

2797
02:01:55,941 --> 02:01:57,200
uh,
yeah,

2798
02:01:57,201 --> 02:01:58,700
even on the nuts and bolts,
if you're,

2799
02:01:58,880 --> 02:02:01,400
if you're starting a new company,
um,

2800
02:02:01,790 --> 02:02:02,240
you know,
five,

2801
02:02:02,241 --> 02:02:07,070
six years ago it was clear and tech that
silicon valley was the right place to do

2802
02:02:07,071 --> 02:02:10,850
it because of all the network effects 
and more capital and more talent.

2803
02:02:10,851 --> 02:02:14,900
And that sort of helped today I think 
it's much more ambiguous.

2804
02:02:14,901 --> 02:02:17,390
It doesn't mean it's all going to move 
to la or move some other place.

2805
02:02:17,391 --> 02:02:22,391
I think.
I think it's gonna be much more 

2806
02:02:22,391 --> 02:02:22,391
decentralized.
Um,

2807
02:02:22,391 --> 02:02:26,210
you know,
one of the very strange ironies or 

2808
02:02:26,210 --> 02:02:28,250
paradoxes of the Internet age that it 
was supposed to,

2809
02:02:28,400 --> 02:02:31,670
the Internet was supposed to eliminate 
the tyranny of place.

2810
02:02:32,080 --> 02:02:32,770
And,
um,

2811
02:02:32,980 --> 02:02:35,890
and that it all was,
almost all of it happened in this,

2812
02:02:35,891 --> 02:02:38,390
uh,
in this narrow silicon valley area.

2813
02:02:38,410 --> 02:02:38,840
You know,
there was a.

2814
02:02:39,170 --> 02:02:44,170
remember there's a talk I gave at 
Stanford University or a panel 

2815
02:02:44,170 --> 02:02:47,831
discussion in two back in 2005.
And one of the questions was where will 

2816
02:02:50,661 --> 02:02:54,800
we find the next google?
So it was a student audience,

2817
02:02:54,810 --> 02:02:58,130
the student union at Stanford and was 
sort of a and so they were interested in

2818
02:02:58,131 --> 02:03:01,580
working for the next Google company.
So it was a search problem searching for

2819
02:03:01,581 --> 02:03:04,130
the next Google can't type into the 
Google search engine,

2820
02:03:04,380 --> 02:03:06,500
but it's really valuable to figure it 
out.

2821
02:03:06,950 --> 02:03:11,120
And I sort of thought it sort of clever,
slightly crypt against I gave was,

2822
02:03:11,640 --> 02:03:16,640
you know,
I think there's a 50 percent chance the 

2823
02:03:16,640 --> 02:03:16,730
next google is within a five mile radius
of this room.

2824
02:03:17,300 --> 02:03:19,610
So it's,
I'm narrowing the search problem.

2825
02:03:19,670 --> 02:03:24,370
Five mile radius was about maybe roughly
a millionth of the surface area of,

2826
02:03:24,490 --> 02:03:25,410
of,
of the resource,

2827
02:03:25,490 --> 02:03:28,600
reducing it by a factor of a million.
The problem still pretty hard.

2828
02:03:28,601 --> 02:03:31,400
A lot of garages and things you have to 
look at within a five mile radius.

2829
02:03:32,450 --> 02:03:35,540
And I think that was actually right.
It was that concentrated.

2830
02:03:35,541 --> 02:03:40,541
So the next Google was facebook and it 
was one point eight miles from that Rep.

2831
02:03:42,500 --> 02:03:43,350
and so,
you know,

2832
02:03:43,370 --> 02:03:45,110
I didn't realize it at the time,
but that was,

2833
02:03:45,470 --> 02:03:47,990
it was correct.
If I had to give the same speech today,

2834
02:03:48,650 --> 02:03:53,650
it would be,
it would be a way less than 50 percent 

2835
02:03:53,650 --> 02:03:54,400
within 50 miles.
Wow.

2836
02:03:54,590 --> 02:03:59,590
And so I think,
I think it is going to be much more 

2837
02:03:59,590 --> 02:04:02,471
decentralized.
So you have the consensus has total 

2838
02:04:02,471 --> 02:04:04,340
centralization and just as with ai and 
Crypto,

2839
02:04:05,000 --> 02:04:08,090
I'd be more in the crypto than the Ai 
side in general.

2840
02:04:08,360 --> 02:04:11,690
I'd be much more on the decentralization
then centralization side.

2841
02:04:11,770 --> 02:04:13,180
So I know you haven't been here for that
long,

2842
02:04:13,210 --> 02:04:18,210
but do you think that there's been any 
costs that you maybe didn't expect like 

2843
02:04:18,210 --> 02:04:18,670
that there's something going on?
They're still,

2844
02:04:18,671 --> 02:04:23,671
there's some still still some spark of 
something that maybe you won't have 

2845
02:04:23,671 --> 02:04:25,810
access to enough or be around as much or
something like that.

2846
02:04:26,130 --> 02:04:27,190
You think there's any risk there?

2847
02:04:27,480 --> 02:04:28,350
You know,
I think,

2848
02:04:28,470 --> 02:04:32,160
I think I'll have access to the same,
the same sort of things,

2849
02:04:32,460 --> 02:04:33,430
but I think,
I think,

2850
02:04:33,480 --> 02:04:37,200
I think it's just getting a little bit 
the outsider perspective.

2851
02:04:37,320 --> 02:04:38,140
Healthy.
Yeah.

2852
02:04:38,610 --> 02:04:39,420
You know,
and uh,

2853
02:04:39,780 --> 02:04:40,890
and you know,
when we,

2854
02:04:40,950 --> 02:04:44,790
when we initially set up my office,
we were in San Francisco,

2855
02:04:44,791 --> 02:04:47,100
which was a little bit outside of 
Silicon Valley for many years.

2856
02:04:47,280 --> 02:04:49,860
So I'm,
so I always think you want to be,

2857
02:04:50,310 --> 02:04:51,430
you want to be,
um,

2858
02:04:52,250 --> 02:04:57,250
you know,
you want to be not in the middle of the 

2859
02:04:57,250 --> 02:04:59,751
insanity.
You don't want to be totally in the 

2860
02:04:59,751 --> 02:04:59,751
boonies,
want to be somewhere in between and a,

2861
02:04:59,800 --> 02:05:04,800
and I don't,
I don't think la is totally in the 

2862
02:05:04,800 --> 02:05:04,800
boonies.

2863
02:05:04,800 --> 02:05:05,670
Well where I live by being.
All right.

2864
02:05:05,990 --> 02:05:06,470
Um,
okay.

2865
02:05:06,471 --> 02:05:07,850
So one more for you.
So,

2866
02:05:07,851 --> 02:05:12,851
you know,
I've been on this tour with Jordan 

2867
02:05:12,851 --> 02:05:12,851
Peterson for the last couple of months 
and you know,

2868
02:05:12,851 --> 02:05:17,241
um,
it's so interesting because I go online 

2869
02:05:17,241 --> 02:05:19,451
all day and there's people yelling at 
each other and seemingly hating each 

2870
02:05:19,451 --> 02:05:22,781
other.
And then I spend my nights with 

2871
02:05:22,781 --> 02:05:24,851
thousands of people who are coming 
together over ideas who may disagree on 

2872
02:05:24,851 --> 02:05:27,050
this or that but really want to find 
some answers.

2873
02:05:27,320 --> 02:05:32,320
So as someone,
one of the few people now that I think 

2874
02:05:32,320 --> 02:05:33,440
is trying to find answers that is 
actually making sense,

2875
02:05:33,441 --> 02:05:38,441
that,
that really wants to look at different 

2876
02:05:38,441 --> 02:05:40,721
ways to solve the problems of the day 
for the young people that are watching 

2877
02:05:40,721 --> 02:05:44,621
this take anyone under 30 that's 
watching this and wants to feel hopeful 

2878
02:05:44,621 --> 02:05:46,220
because that's the other part that I 
think is changing.

2879
02:05:46,221 --> 02:05:49,940
There's a huge amount of people that 
don't feel hopeful for the future.

2880
02:05:50,150 --> 02:05:52,660
They feel our political establishment is
just at,

2881
02:05:52,661 --> 02:05:57,661
uh,
at odds they feel this constant hate 

2882
02:05:57,661 --> 02:06:00,281
online.
For those people that want to feel 

2883
02:06:00,281 --> 02:06:00,281
hopeful,
what do you,

2884
02:06:00,281 --> 02:06:02,750
what can you give them that they can 
look to for a hopeful future?

2885
02:06:04,140 --> 02:06:04,610
Well,
it's,

2886
02:06:04,660 --> 02:06:06,850
it's always hard.
It's always really hard to give,

2887
02:06:07,180 --> 02:06:12,180
you know,
it's always really hard to give generic 

2888
02:06:12,180 --> 02:06:13,500
advice and I not going for generic and 
always,

2889
02:06:13,510 --> 02:06:17,260
I always feel so many things you can say
that just sounds like bs in a way.

2890
02:06:17,261 --> 02:06:21,740
And that's sort of why this is actually 
a simple but difficult question.

2891
02:06:21,741 --> 02:06:24,370
A very hard question away.
I think,

2892
02:06:24,430 --> 02:06:25,470
um,
you know,

2893
02:06:25,500 --> 02:06:27,700
the autobiographical part,
I,

2894
02:06:27,760 --> 02:06:32,760
I tell about my history was that I was,
I was super tracked,

2895
02:06:33,070 --> 02:06:38,070
you know,
it's like eighth grade junior high 

2896
02:06:38,070 --> 02:06:38,070
school yearbook,
one of my friends says,

2897
02:06:38,070 --> 02:06:42,511
you know,
I know you're gonna get into Stanford 

2898
02:06:42,511 --> 02:06:43,711
and four years,
four years later you get into Stanford 

2899
02:06:43,711 --> 02:06:46,020
to get into Stanford law school.
I ended up at a top tier law firm in 

2900
02:06:46,020 --> 02:06:47,270
Manhattan and it was,
you know,

2901
02:06:47,271 --> 02:06:52,271
when these places on the outside,
everybody wanted to get in on the 

2902
02:06:52,271 --> 02:06:52,600
inside,
everybody wanted to get out and um,

2903
02:06:53,050 --> 02:06:56,590
and the sort of,
sort of a quarter life crisis.

2904
02:06:56,620 --> 02:07:01,620
I didn't never had a midlife crisis but 
had maybe a quarter life crisis in my 

2905
02:07:01,620 --> 02:07:02,470
mid twenties and the quarter life crisis
was,

2906
02:07:02,790 --> 02:07:03,810
um,
you know,

2907
02:07:04,150 --> 02:07:08,020
why did I end up in this,
what did I do?

2908
02:07:08,021 --> 02:07:13,021
And I think it was that I,
I just followed the track and I wasn't 

2909
02:07:13,021 --> 02:07:14,200
thinking about,
you know,

2910
02:07:14,530 --> 02:07:17,440
why I was doing things,
what I was doing.

2911
02:07:17,860 --> 02:07:18,830
And,
and,

2912
02:07:18,900 --> 02:07:20,950
and I think that's,
that's sort of,

2913
02:07:21,120 --> 02:07:25,390
that's the generic advice is that um,
the tracks are not working.

2914
02:07:26,410 --> 02:07:27,770
Maybe they,
maybe they worked,

2915
02:07:28,000 --> 02:07:29,920
they worked better in the past,
they had problems,

2916
02:07:29,921 --> 02:07:32,230
but they work better.
They worked,

2917
02:07:32,290 --> 02:07:37,290
they stopped working for Gen x,
they're working even less for 

2918
02:07:37,290 --> 02:07:38,530
millennials or Gen z who,
or whatever's next.

2919
02:07:39,010 --> 02:07:39,700
And it's,
it's,

2920
02:07:39,720 --> 02:07:40,300
it's,
it's,

2921
02:07:40,301 --> 02:07:43,240
um,
and so it's more important than ever to,

2922
02:07:43,241 --> 02:07:48,241
um,
to think for yourself to find something 

2923
02:07:48,241 --> 02:07:48,241
you're good at,
you're interested in,

2924
02:07:48,241 --> 02:07:50,080
you're motivated at and,
and do it.

2925
02:07:50,410 --> 02:07:50,930
The,
um,

2926
02:07:51,150 --> 02:07:51,520
you know,
the,

2927
02:07:51,700 --> 02:07:52,840
again,
the generic,

2928
02:07:53,280 --> 02:07:56,140
the somewhat will actually cross the 
board.

2929
02:07:56,141 --> 02:07:59,310
Advice I always have is not to be overly
competitive that the,

2930
02:07:59,570 --> 02:08:01,780
you know,
the tracks forced you to compete,

2931
02:08:02,220 --> 02:08:03,610
you compete,
you win,

2932
02:08:03,940 --> 02:08:08,350
you cycle and repeat and uh,
and you need to find something where,

2933
02:08:08,530 --> 02:08:13,530
you know,
you're not always just looking at the 

2934
02:08:13,530 --> 02:08:13,990
people around you and you have some,
some other reference point.

2935
02:08:14,560 --> 02:08:15,390
Um,
you know,

2936
02:08:15,530 --> 02:08:16,720
this is sort of more of a,
of a,

2937
02:08:16,721 --> 02:08:18,460
of a religious cut on this.
But,

2938
02:08:18,461 --> 02:08:22,210
uh,
I'm always struck by how,

2939
02:08:22,211 --> 02:08:23,680
um,
you know,

2940
02:08:23,681 --> 02:08:26,490
the 10 commandments there,
they're sort of a,

2941
02:08:26,760 --> 02:08:30,530
they're kind of the first and last and 
some or maybe the,

2942
02:08:30,720 --> 02:08:32,470
the important ones at the,
at the end,

2943
02:08:32,530 --> 02:08:35,230
and one's the first one is you should 
only look to God.

2944
02:08:35,370 --> 02:08:40,370
There's only one God and worship him.
And then the last one is you shouldn't 

2945
02:08:40,370 --> 02:08:42,610
covet anything that belongs to your 
neighbor or,

2946
02:08:42,790 --> 02:08:43,720
and so,
uh,

2947
02:08:43,750 --> 02:08:46,990
that you shouldn't look at the people 
around you too much.

2948
02:08:47,470 --> 02:08:52,470
And um,
and so we need to find some way to look 

2949
02:08:52,470 --> 02:08:52,810
up,
to look,

2950
02:08:53,170 --> 02:08:58,170
uh,
not to look around because when we look 

2951
02:08:58,170 --> 02:08:58,590
around it,
it's a,

2952
02:08:58,670 --> 02:09:03,670
it's not that we figured out what we 
want to do is just ends up being the 

2953
02:09:03,670 --> 02:09:06,040
hyper copycat,
the medic crazed environment.

2954
02:09:06,190 --> 02:09:07,870
And that's.
So it's always,

2955
02:09:08,080 --> 02:09:10,690
there needs to be more of a,
you need to find some transcendence.

2956
02:09:10,691 --> 02:09:11,780
I think this is,
this is what,

2957
02:09:11,890 --> 02:09:16,890
this is,
what's powerful about the Peterson 

2958
02:09:16,890 --> 02:09:17,620
message.
It's that it can't just be fashion.

2959
02:09:17,830 --> 02:09:21,100
It can't just be what everybody thinks 
because that's just a,

2960
02:09:21,370 --> 02:09:26,370
you're gonna.
You're just going to be competing with 

2961
02:09:26,370 --> 02:09:26,370
people like crazy.

2962
02:09:26,370 --> 02:09:26,370
Yeah.
There's a literal metaphor here and that

2963
02:09:26,370 --> 02:09:29,780
we're always looking down on our phones 
while you're telling us to look up.

2964
02:09:31,080 --> 02:09:32,180
Yeah,
we don't,

2965
02:09:32,181 --> 02:09:33,170
but we were always.

2966
02:09:33,340 --> 02:09:37,170
We're looking too much at the people 
around us and we're,

2967
02:09:37,270 --> 02:09:37,880
you know,
and,

2968
02:09:37,881 --> 02:09:38,470
and,
and,

2969
02:09:38,471 --> 02:09:39,700
uh,
and it's,

2970
02:09:39,701 --> 02:09:44,701
it can be efficient,
it can be a shortcut and then at some 

2971
02:09:44,701 --> 02:09:46,050
point it can just be a trap because,
you know,

2972
02:09:46,280 --> 02:09:47,230
it's,
it's like the,

2973
02:09:47,380 --> 02:09:52,380
you know,
the business school example I often 

2974
02:09:52,380 --> 02:09:52,380
give,
were you thinking of a business,

2975
02:09:52,380 --> 02:09:56,340
Harvard business school or any of these 
business schools as hothouse 

2976
02:09:56,340 --> 02:09:56,340
environments,
which you have a bunch of people,

2977
02:09:56,340 --> 02:09:58,570
they have no transcendent reference 
point.

2978
02:09:58,571 --> 02:09:59,290
They,
they,

2979
02:09:59,291 --> 02:10:01,300
uh,
they have no idea what they want to do.

2980
02:10:01,570 --> 02:10:06,570
They're all sort of extroverted.
They'll spend two years talking to each 

2981
02:10:06,570 --> 02:10:09,901
other about what to do.
They don't have any ideas and there's 

2982
02:10:09,901 --> 02:10:11,940
almost a dynamic where you end up with 
a,

2983
02:10:12,240 --> 02:10:17,240
the most faddish that and the most wrong
idea being the consensus choice for,

2984
02:10:17,531 --> 02:10:18,880
uh,
for so many of these people.

2985
02:10:18,881 --> 02:10:21,910
And that's,
that's always a dynamic to try to avoid.

2986
02:10:22,210 --> 02:10:22,710
Yeah.

2987
02:10:23,430 --> 02:10:25,380
I don't know how to end an interview 
better than that.

2988
02:10:25,381 --> 02:10:30,381
I'm,
I'm so glad that we finally got to do 

2989
02:10:30,381 --> 02:10:30,381
this.
You know,

2990
02:10:30,381 --> 02:10:30,381
I was thinking before I sat down with 
you,

2991
02:10:30,381 --> 02:10:34,970
where do I point people to with Peter 
Teal and I can point them to your and 

2992
02:10:34,970 --> 02:10:34,970
everywhere else.
But then I thought,

2993
02:10:34,970 --> 02:10:39,970
you know what?
The guy's only tweeted once and that's 

2994
02:10:39,970 --> 02:10:42,911
probably the best place I could point 
people to because these days everyone's 

2995
02:10:42,911 --> 02:10:44,780
fighting on twitter and you only tweeted
one time.

2996
02:10:45,020 --> 02:10:50,020
So I look at the camera,
follow Peter on the twitter at Peter 

2997
02:10:50,020 --> 02:10:54,370
Teal,
unless you want me to point them 

2998
02:10:54,370 --> 02:10:54,370
somewhere else.
That's okay.

2999
02:10:54,370 --> 02:10:54,370
That's okay.
Pleasure my friend.

3000
02:10:54,370 --> 02:10:54,500
Thank you very much.
All right,

3001
02:10:54,501 --> 02:10:54,980
thanks a lot.
