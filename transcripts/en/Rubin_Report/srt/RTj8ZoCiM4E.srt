1
00:00:05,060 --> 00:00:10,060
Joining me today is the libertarian 
candidate for governor from the great 

2
00:00:10,060 --> 00:00:11,270
state of New York,
Larry Sharpe.

3
00:00:11,271 --> 00:00:13,130
Welcome to the Rubin report.
Thanks for having me.

4
00:00:13,550 --> 00:00:16,160
Libertarian,
New York.

5
00:00:16,220 --> 00:00:17,720
Yes.
Are you okay,

6
00:00:17,721 --> 00:00:22,721
sir?
The issue to remember here is Keto 

7
00:00:22,721 --> 00:00:23,360
actually rated us 50th when it came to 
freedom.

8
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:25,530
We beat California,
so he got you.

9
00:00:26,060 --> 00:00:29,900
When you came,
you came here to California to see me.

10
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:34,960
Yes,
because we're better than you when it 

11
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:34,960
comes to tyranny.
We got you that.

12
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:34,960
We got you.
You can't be this.

13
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:36,410
So yes,
this is a critical piece.

14
00:00:36,411 --> 00:00:41,411
I'm glad I'm doing this.
It's the right answer because imagine 

15
00:00:41,411 --> 00:00:42,470
this,
if I make any impact in New York,

16
00:00:42,950 --> 00:00:47,390
what does that say with country?
It shows that the impact of this race is

17
00:00:47,391 --> 00:00:50,210
so important that if I can make anything
happen in New York state,

18
00:00:50,420 --> 00:00:52,070
it will affect the rest of the nation 
over night.

19
00:00:52,220 --> 00:00:54,680
I want you to imagine for a second in my
race,

20
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:59,300
I just get 10 percent.
That will change how people think in New

21
00:00:59,300 --> 00:01:00,890
York through throughout the entire 
state.

22
00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:04,010
It'll force republicans that actually 
have to be Republicans,

23
00:01:04,250 --> 00:01:05,600
Democrats,
Democrats,

24
00:01:05,601 --> 00:01:08,840
because now the party will have an 
actual voice.

25
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:10,790
So now when I go to Republicans and I 
say,

26
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,590
you're supposed to be about small 
government,

27
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:15,320
someone will listen.
When I go to Democrats and say,

28
00:01:15,470 --> 00:01:17,090
you're supposed to be about civil 
liberties.

29
00:01:17,450 --> 00:01:20,090
Someone will listen.
It will force them to be better,

30
00:01:20,450 --> 00:01:25,450
but I'm going to go one step further.
What if I actually beat the Republican 

31
00:01:25,450 --> 00:01:26,720
in New York State?
That's magical.

32
00:01:27,230 --> 00:01:30,550
I beat the Republican New York state 
politics works for the first two.

33
00:01:30,730 --> 00:01:35,730
Two parties actually run everything so 
republicans would officially be knocked 

34
00:01:35,730 --> 00:01:40,541
out.
So of course that we write the rules 

35
00:01:40,541 --> 00:01:40,541
overnight.
Of course they were the rules.

36
00:01:40,541 --> 00:01:40,541
Of course,
if I know that.

37
00:01:40,541 --> 00:01:42,650
Are you implying that New York state has
a corrupt assembling?

38
00:01:42,651 --> 00:01:43,610
Oh,
come on,

39
00:01:43,970 --> 00:01:46,020
come on.
We have office.

40
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:47,300
Emily.
Let's be clear.

41
00:01:47,940 --> 00:01:50,570
Grew Assembly or insulting me now.
Most corrupt.

42
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:54,200
So now my point being,
it would then allow for third parties to

43
00:01:54,201 --> 00:01:57,290
really exist in New York state and that 
again would cross the nation.

44
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:01,400
But imagine if actually one,
if I actually went and I turned New York

45
00:02:01,401 --> 00:02:06,401
state gold,
that would change the entire nation 

46
00:02:06,401 --> 00:02:06,401
overnight.
Overnight.

47
00:02:06,401 --> 00:02:09,110
All the liberty leaning Republicans,
Democrats would come out of the woodwork

48
00:02:09,260 --> 00:02:14,260
and be like,
we always love Larry Sharp and they 

49
00:02:14,260 --> 00:02:16,061
would all jump on board and,
and the Libertarian party will become 

50
00:02:16,061 --> 00:02:19,330
huge overnight.
This race has the most impact because 

51
00:02:19,330 --> 00:02:19,670
it's New York.
Okay.

52
00:02:19,671 --> 00:02:22,940
So you are acknowledging this is an 
uphill battle.

53
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,680
It's coming.
Yes.

54
00:02:24,681 --> 00:02:26,630
And I got to tell you,
if it was six months ago,

55
00:02:27,170 --> 00:02:30,170
I knew I could make impact that 10 
percent I knew I could get.

56
00:02:30,470 --> 00:02:33,770
I knew that six months ago.
What is the libertarian usually get in a

57
00:02:33,771 --> 00:02:35,830
gubernatorial race?
One percent maybe I met.

58
00:02:35,900 --> 00:02:37,820
That's a lot.
We rarely break 50,000

59
00:02:37,821 --> 00:02:38,690
bucks.
If I go through,

60
00:02:38,691 --> 00:02:40,550
we've ever bring him 2000 bucks.
What do you make of that?

61
00:02:40,551 --> 00:02:42,230
Before we go specifically to your 
candidacy?

62
00:02:42,231 --> 00:02:44,120
Because one of my issues with the 
Libertarians,

63
00:02:44,121 --> 00:02:47,900
it's like as a party,
there's such disorganization.

64
00:02:48,140 --> 00:02:48,790
You know,
I,

65
00:02:48,791 --> 00:02:53,791
I want to talk a little bit about Gary 
Johnson because I know you worked for 

66
00:02:53,791 --> 00:02:53,890
them.
And we're almost his VP choice,

67
00:02:54,190 --> 00:02:59,190
a couple of people tried to beat him up,
but I'm a big fan we can get into to 

68
00:02:59,190 --> 00:03:00,820
some of that stuff and I've had on the 
show and I think he's a good person.

69
00:03:00,821 --> 00:03:05,821
I think he was a flawed candidate,
but just that the party itself seems to 

70
00:03:05,821 --> 00:03:10,381
be extremely disorganized and you know,
when they have these conventions and 

71
00:03:10,381 --> 00:03:13,380
it's like naked people and all this 
naked guys,

72
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,420
naked guy and.

73
00:03:15,820 --> 00:03:18,390
But that have been met naked guy.
I'm sure he's a great,

74
00:03:18,430 --> 00:03:19,780
he's a great guy.
He's a nice guy,

75
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:22,900
but that,
that as a party,

76
00:03:22,901 --> 00:03:27,901
there's been a lot of disorganization 
here and I guess that when you were 

77
00:03:27,901 --> 00:03:29,200
making things about the individual,
it's hard to get people to come together

78
00:03:29,201 --> 00:03:31,180
on a collective,
but what can you do?

79
00:03:31,181 --> 00:03:33,340
What do you think?
That's a fair diagnosis?

80
00:03:33,341 --> 00:03:34,840
Number one,
what I just laid out,

81
00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:36,910
it's tough.
The system is set up against us,

82
00:03:36,911 --> 00:03:41,911
right?
It's up against us to fail any third 

83
00:03:41,911 --> 00:03:41,911
party.
Right.

84
00:03:41,911 --> 00:03:41,911
You.
Do you find any other third parties that

85
00:03:41,911 --> 00:03:41,980
are great?
No,

86
00:03:41,981 --> 00:03:45,520
but I least liked the idea of not on 
board of the green stuff,

87
00:03:45,521 --> 00:03:50,521
so I want them to.
I mean a lot of the third parties 

88
00:03:50,521 --> 00:03:50,521
collapse because the system is against 
them,

89
00:03:50,521 --> 00:03:52,750
but I say the same thing always the 
panacea,

90
00:03:52,751 --> 00:03:55,510
the cure,
all his victory when we begin to.

91
00:03:55,510 --> 00:03:57,130
When people come up on our,
on our,

92
00:03:57,250 --> 00:04:02,250
on our team,
a lot of the people who believe in us 

93
00:04:02,250 --> 00:04:03,340
don't join our party because of that 
chicken and egg.

94
00:04:03,420 --> 00:04:04,060
Yeah,
right.

95
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:08,620
The party isn't awesome because awesome 
people aren't flooding to it because the

96
00:04:08,621 --> 00:04:13,621
party is an awesome.
Therefore all some people are flooding 

97
00:04:13,621 --> 00:04:13,621
to it,
right?

98
00:04:13,621 --> 00:04:16,690
It's a chicken and egg,
so once we become a real party where 

99
00:04:16,690 --> 00:04:16,690
people actually are saying,
wow,

100
00:04:16,690 --> 00:04:21,450
these guys can win.
So when reasons why I'm reading this 

101
00:04:21,450 --> 00:04:21,450
libertarian,
right,

102
00:04:21,450 --> 00:04:21,640
I'm not.
I'm not jumping ship and joining another

103
00:04:21,641 --> 00:04:24,300
party and trying to go on some other 
part of him running as a libertarian.

104
00:04:24,301 --> 00:04:29,301
I'm doing it on purpose.
I want to show people a third party can 

105
00:04:29,301 --> 00:04:32,470
have impact and can win and joined the 
third parties my candidacy is assuming I

106
00:04:32,471 --> 00:04:34,990
do very well,
doesn't just a couple of Italians.

107
00:04:35,380 --> 00:04:38,560
It helps any third party,
but obviously heavily my part.

108
00:04:38,561 --> 00:04:40,930
It's what I care about,
but it will help others also.

109
00:04:41,060 --> 00:04:42,760
So you're right,
it's a problem.

110
00:04:42,761 --> 00:04:44,950
Of course it is,
but all the parties are a problem.

111
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:47,680
Look,
the Republicans and Democrats have Kooks

112
00:04:47,710 --> 00:04:48,850
also,
right?

113
00:04:48,851 --> 00:04:50,470
They have crazy.
There's no doubt about it.

114
00:04:50,710 --> 00:04:54,280
It's just there's so few of us that I 
will stand up and want to scrutiny.

115
00:04:54,670 --> 00:04:58,270
I'm going to things that the things that
politicians who are Democrats,

116
00:04:58,271 --> 00:05:01,510
Republicans have said on far worse than 
Libertarians have set,

117
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:04,210
but it's whatever that the main that the
two old parties.

118
00:05:04,211 --> 00:05:05,890
So they get a pass.
I'm not mad at it.

119
00:05:05,891 --> 00:05:07,840
It's the way it is.
It's a burden that we have,

120
00:05:08,170 --> 00:05:11,020
that I've accepted and I've taken on.
It's the burden I take on.

121
00:05:11,021 --> 00:05:14,080
But here's the glory.
If I win this battle,

122
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:18,880
my victory sweeter because I had all the
burdens I'm find with it is what it is.

123
00:05:19,030 --> 00:05:19,650
Yeah.
Alright.

124
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:24,720
So before we get into the specifics of 
New York and what you are libertarian 

125
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:28,741
principles are and things like that,
tell me a little bit about your history 

126
00:05:28,741 --> 00:05:31,651
because you are actually born and bred 
in New York and you've got an 

127
00:05:31,651 --> 00:05:32,650
interesting history and were in the 
marines and all sorts of stuff.

128
00:05:32,651 --> 00:05:34,710
So it was.
So God gives me back.

129
00:05:34,750 --> 00:05:37,000
I'll give you the short version.
I'm born in Manhattan.

130
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:42,360
I'm biracial parents in the sixties.
My mom gives me up for adoption because 

131
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:44,350
she can't handle the issues of racial 
issues in her family.

132
00:05:44,620 --> 00:05:49,620
I'm very lucky to adopted very young.
I think I was six weeks old by a lovely 

133
00:05:49,620 --> 00:05:53,641
couple who took me to the Bronx,
a German immigrant and I'm her husband 

134
00:05:53,641 --> 00:05:55,540
who was in the army in Germany.
That's how we met her.

135
00:05:56,020 --> 00:05:59,740
So I raised in the bronx for them around
um,

136
00:06:00,020 --> 00:06:01,460
nine or 10 in that area.

137
00:06:01,460 --> 00:06:03,980
11.
And at that point my mother had actually

138
00:06:03,981 --> 00:06:07,850
divorced and met another man who was my 
actual father who actually raised me and

139
00:06:07,851 --> 00:06:09,980
taught me to be a man.
We moved to Long Island.

140
00:06:10,220 --> 00:06:12,970
He died when I was around 12 years old.
When he passed.

141
00:06:12,971 --> 00:06:15,320
It's just me and my mom.
My mom couldn't handle it.

142
00:06:15,380 --> 00:06:18,980
She was really devastated by this.
Her family wasn't Germany.

143
00:06:19,250 --> 00:06:21,230
She was here.
I was distant.

144
00:06:21,231 --> 00:06:23,270
I was a young teenage boy trying to find
my way.

145
00:06:23,271 --> 00:06:24,770
Also,
when I was 17,

146
00:06:24,771 --> 00:06:27,350
I left and joined the Marine Corps.
The Marine Corps was there for about six

147
00:06:27,351 --> 00:06:28,250
years,
seven years.

148
00:06:28,820 --> 00:06:30,620
When I got out,
my mother had already collapsed.

149
00:06:30,890 --> 00:06:34,880
She was initially they can to illegal 
drugs and eventually illegal drugs.

150
00:06:34,881 --> 00:06:38,480
She was arrested because the drug war,
she went to prison and Creighton Felon.

151
00:06:38,870 --> 00:06:41,090
I got her out and try to put it back on 
her feet.

152
00:06:41,660 --> 00:06:46,660
I tried to help her too.
She left the prison with two garbage 

153
00:06:46,660 --> 00:06:47,240
bags.
That was what her life was,

154
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:49,880
so I helped her get back on her feet,
try to get a job.

155
00:06:50,060 --> 00:06:51,830
I saw how hard it was for to get a job.
I mean,

156
00:06:51,831 --> 00:06:54,770
she was always lying on every form 
because of the new.

157
00:06:54,771 --> 00:06:59,771
She was a felony.
They wouldn't hire her and when she was 

158
00:06:59,771 --> 00:06:59,771
working she had to always lie and she 
was a hostage.

159
00:06:59,771 --> 00:07:04,481
Basically I became an entrepreneur 
because I didn't want my mom to be a 

160
00:07:04,481 --> 00:07:04,940
hostage,
so we started our own business.

161
00:07:05,060 --> 00:07:06,950
Me and her and my Stepdad,
who was another man cheat,

162
00:07:06,970 --> 00:07:10,070
she had married afterwards and so we 
stopped,

163
00:07:10,110 --> 00:07:15,110
started businesses together so that she 
could be her own person and not be a 

164
00:07:15,110 --> 00:07:15,110
hostage.
That was our first business.

165
00:07:15,110 --> 00:07:16,400
Um,
after that got up and running,

166
00:07:16,401 --> 00:07:21,401
I left that,
had a bunch of sales jobs and then 

167
00:07:21,401 --> 00:07:23,621
decided to Uhm,
then decided to start my own business 

168
00:07:23,621 --> 00:07:23,621
again.

169
00:07:23,621 --> 00:07:24,080
That business did not go well.
I sold that one off,

170
00:07:24,580 --> 00:07:25,880
um,
that I went and got this business,

171
00:07:25,881 --> 00:07:27,920
which I've had for 14 years.
I'm a consultant,

172
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:30,260
a trainer.
I've been an officer in a public company

173
00:07:30,261 --> 00:07:31,940
twice.
I've taught in colleges.

174
00:07:31,941 --> 00:07:34,070
I teach now at Baruch,
sometimes John Jay.

175
00:07:34,071 --> 00:07:35,710
I've taught at the graduate level of,
uh,

176
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:37,230
as a guest instructor,
uh,

177
00:07:37,350 --> 00:07:39,740
and Yale and Columbia.
So I've taught a lot.

178
00:07:39,741 --> 00:07:41,510
I do a lot of negative coaching,
training,

179
00:07:41,570 --> 00:07:43,130
leadership,
sales,

180
00:07:43,131 --> 00:07:45,120
that kind of stuff.
And I'm an entrepreneur,

181
00:07:45,121 --> 00:07:50,121
but doing it for 14 years and two years 
ago I saw an opportunity to jump on 

182
00:07:50,311 --> 00:07:53,200
board the patreon party as a,
a VP nominees.

183
00:07:53,201 --> 00:07:55,610
So I tried to get the VP slot.
I lost the bill.

184
00:07:55,611 --> 00:07:56,960
Well by 30,
31 votes.

185
00:07:56,961 --> 00:07:58,680
Not that anyone's counting.
Um.

186
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:04,000
And now I'm running for governor.
That was two years ago or that was in 

187
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:04,000
2012?

188
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,630
Twenty 16.
That was 2016 was when I first came to 

189
00:08:07,630 --> 00:08:07,630
the party.
Okay.

190
00:08:07,630 --> 00:08:10,580
I was not,
I was not really political at all when I

191
00:08:10,581 --> 00:08:12,290
was a,
when I was a youngster.

192
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:13,380
Do you wanna hear the story?
Yeah.

193
00:08:13,740 --> 00:08:15,820
When I'm interviewing you,
I write a lot with.

194
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:20,840
I think we're doing it.
I'm happy to the APP away for seven 

195
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:20,840
hours the first time anyone's ever said 
that to me.

196
00:08:20,841 --> 00:08:23,270
I love to hear this story to your 
audience.

197
00:08:23,271 --> 00:08:24,660
Wants to hear my cold stuff.
I don't want.

198
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:25,520
Yes,
Yap away.

199
00:08:25,521 --> 00:08:26,410
And they're like,
you know,

200
00:08:26,450 --> 00:08:28,910
clicking off and we're going to watch.
I don't want to have a drink instead.

201
00:08:28,911 --> 00:08:30,500
I don't know what it,
if that would make it better,

202
00:08:30,501 --> 00:08:31,900
maybe.
Alright.

203
00:08:31,910 --> 00:08:33,740
Let's see what happens with the story.
So,

204
00:08:33,870 --> 00:08:35,660
um,
as a youngster,

205
00:08:35,661 --> 00:08:39,140
I grew up in New York City and of course
Democrats or Republicans are evil.

206
00:08:39,260 --> 00:08:40,040
How it works,
right?

207
00:08:40,070 --> 00:08:41,570
You're evil because you have an art by 
your name.

208
00:08:41,571 --> 00:08:42,740
You're good because you with you by your
name.

209
00:08:43,370 --> 00:08:48,370
Who was the mayor at the time?
This is where I think it was Ed Koch 

210
00:08:48,370 --> 00:08:50,360
cocktail because I loved the head coach.
So I grew up in long island,

211
00:08:50,361 --> 00:08:53,120
but we were big but um,
but it wasn't about him.

212
00:08:53,121 --> 00:08:55,980
It was about the party.
My Mom and dad strict Democrats.

213
00:08:55,981 --> 00:09:00,981
That's who you are.
You voted Democrat because they look 

214
00:09:00,981 --> 00:09:03,401
good and Pumpkins were evil.
But when I joined the marine corps at 

215
00:09:03,401 --> 00:09:05,871
17,
at the Marine Corps is a very 

216
00:09:05,871 --> 00:09:07,401
conservative branch when it comes to the
branches and most of my friends and 

217
00:09:07,401 --> 00:09:07,880
people I know in leaders that are 
respected,

218
00:09:07,881 --> 00:09:09,330
they were mostly conservative 
Republicans.

219
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:14,840
Uh,
Ronald Reagan was my first commander in 

220
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:14,840
chief.
So I think I kind of became a republican

221
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:15,090
as a,
as a team.

222
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:17,590
And as a young 20 something,
I became more of a Republican.

223
00:09:17,591 --> 00:09:22,591
So I kind of shifted back,
I was never part of a party and they 

224
00:09:22,591 --> 00:09:23,400
only voted in the presidential elections
because it was absentee.

225
00:09:23,401 --> 00:09:25,860
I wasn't,
I was always overseas so I wouldn't be a

226
00:09:25,861 --> 00:09:30,861
male,
so I didn't even register locally to do 

227
00:09:30,861 --> 00:09:33,591
the local elections.
So can we pause there for one sec 

228
00:09:33,591 --> 00:09:36,580
because you mentioned you're biracial 
and I hate making anything about race 

229
00:09:36,580 --> 00:09:40,290
because we're so overly racialized now 
and identity politics and all this,

230
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:42,600
but I think that a certain amount of my 
own is when they hear you say that.

231
00:09:42,601 --> 00:09:43,350
All right.
So you were,

232
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:44,880
you were,
uh,

233
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:50,120
Ronald Reagan was your commander in 
chief and you were identifying as a 

234
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:52,170
Republican back then as a black man.
Yup.

235
00:09:52,260 --> 00:09:53,190
Um,
you know,

236
00:09:53,250 --> 00:09:54,930
I've had many black conservatives not 
here,

237
00:09:54,931 --> 00:09:59,931
some of whom I considered great friends,
like Larry Elder and I bet this was the 

238
00:09:59,931 --> 00:09:59,931
eighties,
Thomas Soul on and many or no.

239
00:09:59,931 --> 00:10:01,230
So that's why I wanted to ask you about 
that.

240
00:10:01,430 --> 00:10:06,430
What,
what was it like then to take that 

241
00:10:06,430 --> 00:10:07,110
political,
very political,

242
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:12,200
if that made any sense.
Like I wasn't talking about things I 

243
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:12,200
did,
but even internally for you,

244
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:16,680
I didn't care to before too.
I didn't care if you don't care now.

245
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:19,380
I didn't care that I don't care.
Now I am who I am.

246
00:10:19,381 --> 00:10:21,030
I believe what I believe.
And you like it or you don't.

247
00:10:21,270 --> 00:10:22,770
And that's how it is.
I didn't care that either.

248
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:27,800
Right?
So I didn't really care to be fun with 

249
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:27,800
you.
Some people thought I was crazy.

250
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:27,800
My parents were,
have been insane,

251
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:29,250
but whatever.
I didn't care.

252
00:10:29,251 --> 00:10:30,900
I didn't talk about it much.
It wasn't.

253
00:10:31,170 --> 00:10:32,280
I was worried about,
you know,

254
00:10:32,281 --> 00:10:36,300
chasing girls at 19,
20 years old was being a marine.

255
00:10:36,301 --> 00:10:37,830
I was,
I wasn't worried about it.

256
00:10:37,860 --> 00:10:39,330
It wasn't part of my life to be before 
with you.

257
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:43,410
I look back now and I wish it was.
I wish I had known more stuff then,

258
00:10:43,980 --> 00:10:45,870
but I was a young guy trying to figure 
out to be a man.

259
00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:47,610
I wasn't really thinking about that very
much.

260
00:10:48,060 --> 00:10:51,360
So that's why eventually the nineties I 
went to,

261
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:55,720
I went to Perot because I just didn't 
want the ares of the DS.

262
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:59,220
Then I went to Nader 2000 because I 
didn't want the RS and the DS.

263
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:02,400
I knew that the RS and the Ds were the 
same.

264
00:11:02,401 --> 00:11:07,401
There was no difference.
I knew they were all putting my friends 

265
00:11:07,401 --> 00:11:07,401
in jail.
I knew they will.

266
00:11:07,401 --> 00:11:08,640
All the one drugs and the war on terror 
wasn't going to stop that.

267
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:10,110
That's going to be bad no matter what I 
did.

268
00:11:10,410 --> 00:11:12,900
Excuse me.
So I just.

269
00:11:12,901 --> 00:11:14,880
And again,
if you would've asked me what was Perot,

270
00:11:14,881 --> 00:11:17,160
what was it?
What was a nadir?

271
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:19,350
His policies.
I couldn't have told you.

272
00:11:20,220 --> 00:11:25,220
I just knew they weren't the mainstream 
and therefore they have a good enough 

273
00:11:25,220 --> 00:11:25,220
for me.
And again,

274
00:11:25,220 --> 00:11:25,650
people thought I was crazy and I didn't 
care.

275
00:11:26,340 --> 00:11:28,230
So finally,
in 2008,

276
00:11:28,231 --> 00:11:29,490
I was considering not voting at all 
anymore.

277
00:11:29,491 --> 00:11:30,420
I was really finished.
I was like,

278
00:11:30,421 --> 00:11:32,700
they'll do care.
It doesn't matter of running a business.

279
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:33,770
I'm gonna,
run my business,

280
00:11:33,790 --> 00:11:38,790
make my money,
become a bazillionaire and who cares 

281
00:11:38,790 --> 00:11:39,000
who's in charge because I'll run them 
because I'll have all the money.

282
00:11:39,060 --> 00:11:42,150
That was my logic.
It doesn't for so are the eight.

283
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:43,710
When Obama came,
I thought,

284
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:44,700
okay,
this is different.

285
00:11:45,830 --> 00:11:49,800
He's the city Guy Black.
This is the guy.

286
00:11:49,830 --> 00:11:51,540
He's different.
He speaks differently.

287
00:11:51,660 --> 00:11:53,460
People are excited.
All right.

288
00:11:53,470 --> 00:11:55,000
You know what?
Maybe this is the guy and I,

289
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:57,610
I had hope I,
I bought the hope and change.

290
00:11:57,820 --> 00:12:02,820
I bought it and when I address it before
you added sort of a libertarian 

291
00:12:02,820 --> 00:12:02,820
awakening,
right?

292
00:12:03,370 --> 00:12:04,430
Actually I,
I,

293
00:12:04,540 --> 00:12:06,400
this is,
I was having libertarian awakening,

294
00:12:06,790 --> 00:12:09,640
but that sort of overrode it.
But I gotta tell you how I became that.

295
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:12,190
I became a libertarian,
not through politics.

296
00:12:12,730 --> 00:12:14,350
I came to trying it through Robert 
Ringer.

297
00:12:15,260 --> 00:12:20,260
Robert Ringer.
I don't think Robert Ringer is a 

298
00:12:20,260 --> 00:12:22,171
business guy.
He's a subjectivist and he wrote many 

299
00:12:22,171 --> 00:12:23,350
books looking out for number one to be 
a,

300
00:12:23,380 --> 00:12:25,570
not to be intimidated,
nothing happens.

301
00:12:25,630 --> 00:12:27,670
Uh,
unless something moves action.

302
00:12:27,910 --> 00:12:32,910
He talks about how to brand yourself.
He talks about how to be successful in 

303
00:12:32,910 --> 00:12:33,640
business in life.
I was a trainer as well.

304
00:12:33,641 --> 00:12:35,530
I said there now,
he was one of my mentors.

305
00:12:35,531 --> 00:12:37,330
I don't know him personally,
but I've read his books.

306
00:12:37,540 --> 00:12:39,820
I was part of his website,
so I knew who he was,

307
00:12:39,821 --> 00:12:43,140
so he.
He got me into reading and rent.

308
00:12:43,790 --> 00:12:46,270
I didn't come to libertarianism through 
politics.

309
00:12:46,271 --> 00:12:46,960
I came into business.

310
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:51,960
I'm a business guy,
so I was reading atlas shrugged because 

311
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:53,230
he said we that the shrugged not because
some political I did.

312
00:12:53,410 --> 00:12:55,270
I didn't know who Ron Paul was.
Doesn't eight.

313
00:12:55,510 --> 00:12:57,430
I had no idea.
I wasn't political.

314
00:12:57,431 --> 00:13:00,420
I was a business guy.
The only reason why I care about Obama's

315
00:13:00,430 --> 00:13:02,860
because he was so different.
It got my attention.

316
00:13:03,340 --> 00:13:05,760
So again,
I didn't really understand his policies,

317
00:13:05,761 --> 00:13:07,960
if that made me sense.
I just thought he's different.

318
00:13:08,170 --> 00:13:10,870
He's not them.
It can't be worse.

319
00:13:11,290 --> 00:13:16,290
That was my thought process.
So as I'm moving towards objectivism in 

320
00:13:16,290 --> 00:13:19,951
that regard,
I'm not an objectivist and I'd never 

321
00:13:19,951 --> 00:13:22,051
been one,
but some of the market ideas made sense 

322
00:13:22,051 --> 00:13:25,441
to me.
The idea of Austrian economics made 

323
00:13:25,441 --> 00:13:27,271
sense to me.
I didn't know it was Austrian economics 

324
00:13:27,271 --> 00:13:30,410
though,
because I'd never read freedom and I'd 

325
00:13:30,410 --> 00:13:30,410
never read those.
I didn't know.

326
00:13:30,410 --> 00:13:32,710
I read Robert Ringer and he had told me 
what his,

327
00:13:32,890 --> 00:13:35,950
his views,
so I got things secondhand through him,

328
00:13:36,610 --> 00:13:37,510
so I was already teaching.

329
00:13:37,510 --> 00:13:38,950
I was teaching postindustrial 
leadership.

330
00:13:39,130 --> 00:13:44,130
Obviously she'd buy in.
I was teaching sales is not about 

331
00:13:44,130 --> 00:13:44,380
forcing someone to do something,
getting to do it.

332
00:13:44,650 --> 00:13:49,650
I was teaching volunteerism,
not knowing what it was called or what 

333
00:13:49,650 --> 00:13:53,281
it was.
I was already doing it in my own 

334
00:13:53,281 --> 00:13:53,281
business.
So anyway,

335
00:13:53,281 --> 00:13:56,881
I was.
I was having that change so it doesn't 

336
00:13:56,881 --> 00:13:57,070
fall and about 2010.
Anyway,

337
00:13:57,071 --> 00:14:02,071
that was happening already.
So it changed my business model and 

338
00:14:02,071 --> 00:14:02,071
doing it already.
After crash it,

339
00:14:02,071 --> 00:14:03,700
I had to jump into it a lot because I 
was crushed,

340
00:14:03,990 --> 00:14:04,560
crushed,
crushed,

341
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:06,250
devastated me.
So anyway,

342
00:14:06,260 --> 00:14:07,020
I,
I'm,

343
00:14:07,050 --> 00:14:12,050
I think Obama's great.
After the first year I realize he's no 

344
00:14:12,050 --> 00:14:13,180
different again.
I'm finished.

345
00:14:13,420 --> 00:14:15,850
I'm like,
it's over until 2012.

346
00:14:15,851 --> 00:14:17,950
I hear Gary Johnson speak and people 
say,

347
00:14:17,951 --> 00:14:18,550
well,
Gary John,

348
00:14:18,590 --> 00:14:20,260
he's an awesome speaker.
No,

349
00:14:20,980 --> 00:14:23,890
but he was a business guy.
I'm a business guy.

350
00:14:24,310 --> 00:14:25,420
I could hear him.

351
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:28,120
I couldn't hear anyone else because I 
didn't care.

352
00:14:28,390 --> 00:14:33,390
I could only hear the person who I was 
identified with him self made man and 

353
00:14:33,390 --> 00:14:35,460
growing a business identify with Gary 
Johnson.

354
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:39,820
I still do,
and so when he decided to talk I said,

355
00:14:39,850 --> 00:14:40,630
oh,
I get it.

356
00:14:40,900 --> 00:14:43,390
And I came to the part because of him,
but we forward.

357
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:45,520
I didn't join the party still right 
away.

358
00:14:46,030 --> 00:14:47,980
I'd never done a part of my life.
I'd never done a party,

359
00:14:48,700 --> 00:14:50,260
but at this point I thought,
you know what?

360
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:54,080
I'm going to go to the meetings and 
never been to a party meeting before and

361
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:59,120
I went to the meetings and when I went 
to Libertarian party meetings as odd as 

362
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:01,700
they were and they are odd,
it was still just regular people.

363
00:15:02,420 --> 00:15:04,520
It wasn't crazy.
It was regular people,

364
00:15:04,580 --> 00:15:09,580
business owners,
people who wanted to see some change 

365
00:15:09,580 --> 00:15:09,770
identified quickly with them and I 
joined.

366
00:15:10,250 --> 00:15:12,860
So I joined the Party in 2012 and that's
when I became a libertarian.

367
00:15:13,550 --> 00:15:16,400
But when I joined the party I hadn't 
read.

368
00:15:17,030 --> 00:15:19,630
I hadn't read for.
I didn't read any of them had had.

369
00:15:19,640 --> 00:15:22,190
I didn't even know them.
So that's when I joined them.

370
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:27,280
I began looking around and then I then I
read the law [inaudible] my favorite of 

371
00:15:27,280 --> 00:15:27,280
all them was his boss,
yet it's my favorite.

372
00:15:27,280 --> 00:15:31,490
That was the simplest and the one that 
identified with the most still my 

373
00:15:31,490 --> 00:15:31,490
favorite,
but I read all the rest.

374
00:15:31,490 --> 00:15:31,490
Also.
I began to read them.

375
00:15:31,490 --> 00:15:33,080
Right.
I read the word road to serfdom.

376
00:15:33,081 --> 00:15:38,081
I began to read those afterwards,
but they were easy for me to understand 

377
00:15:38,081 --> 00:15:38,560
that people,
they tease me.

378
00:15:38,561 --> 00:15:40,700
The Larry,
you've been in the movement so short,

379
00:15:40,780 --> 00:15:41,690
short time,
but you can.

380
00:15:41,930 --> 00:15:46,930
You can talk with the principals.
I've been teaching them for 14 years but

381
00:15:47,301 --> 00:15:49,670
not under the name,
right.

382
00:15:49,700 --> 00:15:54,700
In a different world,
so it was very easy to adapt and to 

383
00:15:54,700 --> 00:15:55,550
bring those,
those things to bear.

384
00:15:55,670 --> 00:16:00,670
So bought for Gary Johnson in 2012 and I
support his candidacy completely in 

385
00:16:00,670 --> 00:16:04,901
2016.
I was running around doing debates in 

386
00:16:04,901 --> 00:16:07,541
his stead.
I was on TV instead for him and then he 

387
00:16:07,541 --> 00:16:10,350
wanted I would do so I jumped through 
hoops for them because I wish he was a 

388
00:16:10,350 --> 00:16:12,851
president now when she was.
So I don't want to Belabor the point 

389
00:16:12,851 --> 00:16:12,851
where Gary,
I voted for Gary,

390
00:16:12,851 --> 00:16:17,840
I did a video in the summer before the 
election of why it would be great to 

391
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:18,410
support him even though he wasn't a 
perfect candidate,

392
00:16:18,411 --> 00:16:19,160
et Cetera,
et cetera.

393
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:21,650
But he,
he had a couple of gaps that were pretty

394
00:16:21,651 --> 00:16:26,651
bad and I also,
I don't even blame him for them in a 

395
00:16:26,651 --> 00:16:26,651
certain way because it was the only to 
your point,

396
00:16:26,750 --> 00:16:28,520
it was the only way he could get 
pressed.

397
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:33,520
Like the only time they talked about him
was Aleppo apps or the other moment 

398
00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:34,790
where he couldn't name a leader that he 
respected.

399
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:40,120
But the one,
the one policy point that really 

400
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:42,701
bothered me with him and I don't know,
maybe maybe we don't see eye to eye on 

401
00:16:42,701 --> 00:16:45,461
this,
is that he wanted the baker to bake the 

402
00:16:45,461 --> 00:16:45,461
cake.
Well,

403
00:16:45,461 --> 00:16:49,421
let me touch to two of those things.
The first thing is every problem that 

404
00:16:49,421 --> 00:16:51,950
Gary Johnson had is fixed with good 
advisors.

405
00:16:52,730 --> 00:16:53,440
Everyone,
yeah.

406
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:56,090
Repaired was good advisors.
Every problem you had,

407
00:16:56,360 --> 00:16:57,470
you get him.
Good advisors,

408
00:16:57,740 --> 00:17:02,740
fixed Clinton and trump.
I don't care who you put in front of 

409
00:17:02,740 --> 00:17:02,740
them,
it's irrelevant.

410
00:17:03,110 --> 00:17:04,790
Who Do you put?
Whatever team you put in for them.

411
00:17:04,850 --> 00:17:08,030
They have character flaws.
Johnson doesn't have that.

412
00:17:08,510 --> 00:17:10,680
So you as a human being,
he's.

413
00:17:10,710 --> 00:17:12,470
I'm telling you,
I don't have to tell you,

414
00:17:12,471 --> 00:17:17,471
but I mean I sat there with him for an 
hour and some time off camera and I 

415
00:17:17,471 --> 00:17:17,990
thought this is a decent human hundred 
percent.

416
00:17:17,990 --> 00:17:18,620
Yes,
I'm with you.

417
00:17:18,650 --> 00:17:23,650
So if I had a choice,
I'd rather be president now without 

418
00:17:23,650 --> 00:17:24,230
question of course.
But the second was to bake the cake.

419
00:17:24,650 --> 00:17:29,650
He didn't do a good job explaining what 
he really meant and I let me try to 

420
00:17:29,650 --> 00:17:33,281
explain it to make it clearer.
He understood the cultural aspects of 

421
00:17:33,281 --> 00:17:35,660
this as do I as a person of color,
right.

422
00:17:35,661 --> 00:17:39,170
There is a.
we've had literally decades,

423
00:17:39,171 --> 00:17:44,150
if not centuries of state sponsored 
segregation,

424
00:17:44,390 --> 00:17:46,940
punishment by gender,
by,

425
00:17:47,090 --> 00:17:48,470
by,
by race,

426
00:17:49,060 --> 00:17:54,060
by sexual preference.
That is still in the psyche of the 

427
00:17:54,060 --> 00:17:58,530
American.
It feels terrible to do what is right,

428
00:17:59,130 --> 00:18:00,270
if that makes any sense.
Yeah,

429
00:18:00,450 --> 00:18:03,780
it feels terrible and while the person 
goes,

430
00:18:03,781 --> 00:18:05,430
but it's wrong.
I get it,

431
00:18:05,550 --> 00:18:09,300
emotion and culture matter and what he 
was trying to get at,

432
00:18:09,301 --> 00:18:14,301
which is my policy.
It was to find a good solid middle 

433
00:18:14,301 --> 00:18:14,301
ground.

434
00:18:14,301 --> 00:18:18,860
I do not want a bigger to make a cake 
for someone he doesn't want a make a 

435
00:18:18,991 --> 00:18:20,730
cake for.
That's his labor.

436
00:18:20,790 --> 00:18:23,580
Having to do it for someone that's wrong
should never happen.

437
00:18:24,270 --> 00:18:27,870
So here is the.
Here is the good compromise.

438
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:33,440
If a baker or anyone,
anyone creates a product and puts it 

439
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:38,840
into the retail market,
whether that be online or on a shelf in 

440
00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:43,191
a store.
If a person gets your product and puts 

441
00:18:43,191 --> 00:18:44,300
it there,
he must allow anyone who has the current

442
00:18:44,301 --> 00:18:46,380
two that he wants to purchase that 
product.

443
00:18:46,540 --> 00:18:47,370
So so far,
yeah.

444
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:50,070
I'm with you so far.
Now that you could say,

445
00:18:50,250 --> 00:18:54,060
and purists will say no Larry.
He can say no to anyone.

446
00:18:54,120 --> 00:18:59,120
So that would be the set of people who 
would like to go back and reverse this 

447
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:02,600
64 civil liberties.
I'm saying just let now if the person 

448
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:07,491
is,
I want that cake off the shelf and 

449
00:19:07,491 --> 00:19:08,790
literally you're Jewish and he's a Nazi 
with a swastika.

450
00:19:08,790 --> 00:19:10,560
On his arm,
you must say,

451
00:19:10,620 --> 00:19:12,200
take it,
you have the money to take my ticket out

452
00:19:12,201 --> 00:19:13,330
of here.
So he told them.

453
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:16,830
He then says,
I now want you to put on it so and so.

454
00:19:17,010 --> 00:19:22,010
No,
you can refuse that service because now 

455
00:19:22,010 --> 00:19:25,701
that's not retail.
That's you doing a service for that 

456
00:19:25,701 --> 00:19:26,580
individual.
You should absolutely be able to say,

457
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:31,640
no,
I will not put anything on that cake at 

458
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:31,640
all.
That's the way it is.

459
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:32,430
That's why I made it for anyone.
If you want it,

460
00:19:32,730 --> 00:19:34,440
take it.
That's not good enough for you.

461
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:38,130
Have a nice day.
That is my compromise and I think that's

462
00:19:38,131 --> 00:19:43,131
what Gary Johnson actually meant to say 
because if you're hurt the way you said 

463
00:19:43,131 --> 00:19:43,290
it,
and when I spoke to him about it,

464
00:19:43,291 --> 00:19:45,360
he understood what I was saying.
Then I wish I.

465
00:19:45,361 --> 00:19:47,900
I'm because I'm with you on what you 
just said this.

466
00:19:47,940 --> 00:19:49,420
I'm with you.
I'm and I want to.

467
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:54,440
I tried to defend him with that,
but it didn't come across right and I 

468
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:54,480
think he did that and it because for him
to be fired,

469
00:19:54,481 --> 00:19:55,920
I'm going to defend them and defend 
them.

470
00:19:55,921 --> 00:19:58,110
Often.
It's emotional for him,

471
00:19:58,111 --> 00:20:01,430
so it didn't come across well.
It's emotional for me to write.

472
00:20:01,431 --> 00:20:04,170
I know what it's like.
I know personally what it's like to be.

473
00:20:04,350 --> 00:20:07,470
To be ignored in a restaurant.
I know what that's like.

474
00:20:08,410 --> 00:20:12,660
Black people don't.
It feels terrible now to be forward.

475
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:14,790
I think that's a good compromise.
Okay,

476
00:20:14,791 --> 00:20:19,791
so I'm with you on that.
I'm glad you cleaned it up for yourself 

477
00:20:19,791 --> 00:20:19,791
and I'm glad you cleaned it up for Gary 
because I,

478
00:20:19,791 --> 00:20:23,981
I feel kind of [inaudible] I know he's a
decent guy and I don't like giving him 

479
00:20:23,981 --> 00:20:26,751
crap for it.
What would you say to the part of the 

480
00:20:26,751 --> 00:20:29,421
libertarians that want to go that extra 
step and say either the 64 act should be

481
00:20:30,481 --> 00:20:33,540
repealed because we don't need these 
laws anymore or that no,

482
00:20:33,541 --> 00:20:34,200
you just.

483
00:20:34,380 --> 00:20:39,380
Even if it's just the same old product 
on your shelf and you just don't like 

484
00:20:39,380 --> 00:20:40,470
the way somebody looks because you are a
bigot,

485
00:20:40,890 --> 00:20:44,430
it's still your stuff and and what,
what do you say?

486
00:20:44,431 --> 00:20:46,770
They are theoretically correct and 
realistically wrong,

487
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:51,340
and if they don't accept the compromise,
they're going to get worse.

488
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:55,130
This is the problem that a lot of the 
more hard libertarians don't know.

489
00:20:55,140 --> 00:20:56,980
Is that clear?
I love them.

490
00:20:56,981 --> 00:20:58,960
I want them in the party.
They are critical.

491
00:20:59,080 --> 00:21:03,220
They are the backbone of the party.
There are our harshest and most powerful

492
00:21:03,221 --> 00:21:04,630
activists.
We need them.

493
00:21:04,710 --> 00:21:06,340
Yeah,
and you believe that that's not based in

494
00:21:06,341 --> 00:21:07,790
bigotry.
That's no,

495
00:21:08,060 --> 00:21:09,970
that's an adult,
but that's an important distinction.

496
00:21:09,971 --> 00:21:12,790
It's based on righteousness and they're 
right.

497
00:21:13,090 --> 00:21:17,170
The problem is if you don't take that 
first step,

498
00:21:17,710 --> 00:21:19,690
you will get nothing but not just 
nothing.

499
00:21:19,930 --> 00:21:23,620
Those people who keep voting are going 
to keep voting our rights away.

500
00:21:23,860 --> 00:21:28,860
They do it every single year.
They keep voting our rights away as we 

501
00:21:29,501 --> 00:21:33,250
accept everything or nothing.
It isn't nothing.

502
00:21:33,370 --> 00:21:35,980
It's worse.
It's worse.

503
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:38,650
Give us the compromise.
That makes sense.

504
00:21:38,860 --> 00:21:43,860
They'll see the world doesn't end.
They'll see this not a zombie 

505
00:21:43,860 --> 00:21:44,230
apocalypse,
and then we can move to the next level.

506
00:21:44,830 --> 00:21:49,830
Is that part of the problem of being 
sort of an outlier party because the 

507
00:21:49,830 --> 00:21:51,280
libertarian party that's existed for a 
long time and it's an on all the ballots

508
00:21:51,281 --> 00:21:54,400
but never really breaks any major 
threshold.

509
00:21:54,790 --> 00:21:58,840
That part of it is you get too caught up
in the purity test.

510
00:21:58,870 --> 00:22:00,390
Now all parties do in a way,
but do,

511
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:05,500
but I think for the third party,
if there's maybe a little trickier and 

512
00:22:05,500 --> 00:22:08,251
maybe for libertarians more than als,
because if you're really basing it on 

513
00:22:08,251 --> 00:22:09,550
the individual,
the purity test is pretty freaking high,

514
00:22:09,551 --> 00:22:11,590
is what you're going to make that very 
clear.

515
00:22:11,890 --> 00:22:13,150
You.
You look at Democrats,

516
00:22:13,151 --> 00:22:15,580
Republicans now they're not actually 
parties,

517
00:22:15,581 --> 00:22:18,310
their tribes,
and I mean that literally their tribes.

518
00:22:18,970 --> 00:22:21,280
You have Weber's the king of the tribe 
at the moment.

519
00:22:21,970 --> 00:22:25,600
The will of the king is the platform,
right?

520
00:22:25,660 --> 00:22:28,480
So whatever trump says,
that's the platform,

521
00:22:28,510 --> 00:22:33,510
right?
Assuming that Bernie's still top of the 

522
00:22:33,510 --> 00:22:33,850
Democrats will be is whoever is right,
then that's the platform.

523
00:22:33,890 --> 00:22:36,040
Whoever the person is,
that's the platform.

524
00:22:36,041 --> 00:22:38,750
The platform is whoever is on top of the
part of what you want.

525
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:41,380
They don't argue as much,
which is why they close ranks,

526
00:22:41,650 --> 00:22:42,580
right?
So easily.

527
00:22:43,220 --> 00:22:45,970
Liquidated probably is different.
It actually has an ideology.

528
00:22:46,930 --> 00:22:49,150
I can call myself king a libertarian if 
I want to.

529
00:22:49,330 --> 00:22:52,330
That's not going to go well at all and 
no one's gonna.

530
00:22:52,540 --> 00:22:54,730
No one's gonna buy it.
That's not going to work.

531
00:22:54,731 --> 00:22:58,060
They want to change that language.
That is not gonna work at all.

532
00:22:58,420 --> 00:23:03,420
I can say it if I want to,
so what I'll get laughed out of the 

533
00:23:03,420 --> 00:23:04,150
party because it's not about me.
It's about audiology,

534
00:23:04,180 --> 00:23:06,820
which is why we argue to be forward with
you.

535
00:23:07,030 --> 00:23:11,080
I'm happy we argue I am because it makes
us a better party.

536
00:23:11,140 --> 00:23:16,140
It makes us clearer.
It actually makes policy easier for us 

537
00:23:16,140 --> 00:23:16,210
because we don't look at Paul's of that.
Oh,

538
00:23:16,211 --> 00:23:17,920
this policy fits this.
No,

539
00:23:17,921 --> 00:23:21,880
it's based upon based upon audiology,
so I'm actually happy that we argue.

540
00:23:22,120 --> 00:23:24,100
I wish we would argue so much as a 
publicly.

541
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:26,020
Right.
That's the part that drives me crazy,

542
00:23:26,021 --> 00:23:29,350
that we do it so publicly and that we 
fight so hard,

543
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:31,510
but I'm glad we have an idea.
Again,

544
00:23:31,511 --> 00:23:33,040
I don't know that it's that you guys are
doing.

545
00:23:33,041 --> 00:23:34,570
It's so public.
It's just that that's the only time that

546
00:23:34,571 --> 00:23:38,470
you're seeing in public.
It's a bit of an important distinction.

547
00:23:38,560 --> 00:23:43,560
So when you say that the way you just 
described the cake situation is 

548
00:23:43,560 --> 00:23:44,650
basically your view on government in 
general,

549
00:23:44,830 --> 00:23:49,830
because again,
this is where you can go to a 

550
00:23:49,830 --> 00:23:51,671
libertarian that really isn't an endcap 
or the people you described as the 

551
00:23:51,671 --> 00:23:52,040
backbone that it basically you're sort 
of.

552
00:23:52,340 --> 00:23:57,340
I guess I would just.
I mean this is what I would say 

553
00:23:57,340 --> 00:23:58,901
classical liberal is really,
it's just that where the rubber meets 

554
00:23:58,901 --> 00:23:59,300
the road,
you understand that there has to be some

555
00:23:59,510 --> 00:24:02,390
level of government.
Is that sort of your guiding principle?

556
00:24:02,490 --> 00:24:07,490
Like my,
my north star is a full voluntary 

557
00:24:07,490 --> 00:24:09,560
society.
That's my north star.

558
00:24:10,100 --> 00:24:15,100
I would love to have a total and fully 
voluntary society.

559
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:17,490
How do you define what that is?
Where,

560
00:24:17,530 --> 00:24:20,480
where government is even voluntary.
That would be amazing.

561
00:24:20,840 --> 00:24:24,560
But to be fair with you,
our nation is no where near.

562
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:25,100
I mean that's.

563
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:28,010
I modeled was asking you what I'd like.
I'd like.

564
00:24:28,011 --> 00:24:33,011
I'd like a world where leprechauns ride 
unicorns at the moment it's the same 

565
00:24:33,011 --> 00:24:34,060
thing and it just doesn't exist.
Yeah,

566
00:24:34,140 --> 00:24:39,140
it's,
we're nowhere near there and one reason 

567
00:24:39,140 --> 00:24:42,070
why I'm attacking New York state as,
as hard as I am campaigning so hard is 

568
00:24:42,070 --> 00:24:46,330
if we can just stop the bleeding.
If we can just stop it from shifting lap

569
00:24:46,790 --> 00:24:47,680
right now,
and if you know,

570
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:52,720
we're talking in New York state about 
giving teachers the right to tell law 

571
00:24:54,081 --> 00:24:59,081
enforcement if a child is dangerous so 
they can now confiscate that child's 

572
00:24:59,081 --> 00:25:02,450
parents.
Guns were talking about that now.

573
00:25:02,510 --> 00:25:07,400
That's the new them's on New York state 
where Joe wed going so far away.

574
00:25:07,401 --> 00:25:09,890
It's not even funny.
So talk about this.

575
00:25:10,450 --> 00:25:13,700
It's imaginary.
I just want to turn it around.

576
00:25:14,510 --> 00:25:17,000
Let me do that.
If I do that,

577
00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:18,230
we've got to shout to get in there.

578
00:25:18,590 --> 00:25:21,200
I probably will never see a voluntary 
society in my life.

579
00:25:21,230 --> 00:25:23,330
I probably won't.
It'd be awesome if I could,

580
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:28,840
but can I turn us around so we're facing
it at least that I can do that I can 

581
00:25:28,840 --> 00:25:30,800
absolutely do and I can do it in my 
lifetime.

582
00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:32,930
I can do it in New York state and new in
the country.

583
00:25:33,020 --> 00:25:35,660
We can do that.
So with that in mind,

584
00:25:35,661 --> 00:25:37,580
and when you talk about the principles 
of the party,

585
00:25:37,790 --> 00:25:41,390
how do you generally decide what the 
right amount of government is then?

586
00:25:41,540 --> 00:25:46,540
I mean you're,
you want to be in the government so the 

587
00:25:46,540 --> 00:25:46,540
government has to do something.
Is it,

588
00:25:46,540 --> 00:25:49,640
is it really just on a case by case 
basis of both the lightest touch?

589
00:25:49,670 --> 00:25:51,670
It's always okay.
Do you.

590
00:25:52,580 --> 00:25:54,500
Have you ever run for office?
Not yet.

591
00:25:54,650 --> 00:25:57,770
Alright.
One of the reasons why it's so hard.

592
00:25:57,800 --> 00:25:59,480
There's many reasons why one is raising 
money,

593
00:25:59,481 --> 00:26:04,481
obviously the one's time,
but the third one is understanding all 

594
00:26:04,481 --> 00:26:07,510
the policies and when you begin to 
understand how much government intrusion

595
00:26:07,511 --> 00:26:12,511
in our life,
it's depressing and I mean that truly 

596
00:26:13,340 --> 00:26:18,340
most people have no idea how much 
government in truth in our life and how 

597
00:26:18,340 --> 00:26:18,340
much ask you hurts.

598
00:26:18,770 --> 00:26:21,710
It's depressing.
I've policy coals.

599
00:26:21,711 --> 00:26:25,220
Every my policy team,
we were on the phone using anywhere from

600
00:26:25,221 --> 00:26:27,680
an hour to two hours every week and 
discussing policy issues.

601
00:26:28,490 --> 00:26:31,880
Sometimes I'm depressed when I'm done 
because it's so bad.

602
00:26:32,180 --> 00:26:37,180
There's no good answer because 
government problem has been solved with 

603
00:26:37,180 --> 00:26:41,561
government bandaid,
which has been solved by government 

604
00:26:41,561 --> 00:26:41,561
bandaid,
so if you pull off government bandaid,

605
00:26:41,561 --> 00:26:45,210
you've three more broken bandaids 
underneath it that sometimes make things

606
00:26:45,211 --> 00:26:49,050
worse.
Sometimes taking government off makes it

607
00:26:49,051 --> 00:26:52,890
worse because of three more band aids 
that are all terrible.

608
00:26:53,550 --> 00:26:55,230
Sometimes you have to just say,
I can't touch that.

609
00:26:55,920 --> 00:26:58,950
I just have to let it stay there.
And you have someone who goes,

610
00:26:58,951 --> 00:27:00,060
but Larry,
that's wrong.

611
00:27:00,061 --> 00:27:01,080
That righteous.
That's easy.

612
00:27:01,081 --> 00:27:04,800
We have to stop it.
There are 3000 things I have to fix.

613
00:27:05,100 --> 00:27:08,250
Some I just can't put on my radar.
So yes,

614
00:27:08,251 --> 00:27:13,251
it's always case by case to try to fix 
government is a Herculean task that no 

615
00:27:14,521 --> 00:27:14,910
one could do.

616
00:27:15,570 --> 00:27:20,570
What do you make of the states like New 
York that have gotten so away from the 

617
00:27:20,581 --> 00:27:22,770
ideas?
Forget the policies,

618
00:27:22,771 --> 00:27:24,810
forget the 3000 problems.
Right?

619
00:27:25,110 --> 00:27:30,110
But just the basic ideas of why liberty 
and individualism and limited government

620
00:27:30,841 --> 00:27:35,841
and your own capacity to control your 
property and things of that nature that 

621
00:27:35,841 --> 00:27:36,870
the states that have gotten so far away 
from that.

622
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:38,000
I mean,
that's,

623
00:27:38,050 --> 00:27:39,410
I guess that's why you're running in the
first.

624
00:27:39,630 --> 00:27:41,700
It's culture.
People ask all the time,

625
00:27:41,730 --> 00:27:42,570
they say,
you know,

626
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:44,160
what are your first hundred days and to 
be like,

627
00:27:44,161 --> 00:27:49,161
and what are you gonna Change?
They think I'm going to walk into New 

628
00:27:49,161 --> 00:27:50,730
York state as governor and wave my magic
wand or bring up my guy.

629
00:27:50,760 --> 00:27:52,680
I'm the kid now.
Everything changes.

630
00:27:53,250 --> 00:27:55,470
Of course not.
I wouldn't want to.

631
00:27:55,471 --> 00:28:00,471
If I could write,
I can't and I wouldn't want to if I 

632
00:28:00,471 --> 00:28:04,161
could.
That kind of fast change makes people 

633
00:28:04,161 --> 00:28:05,100
afraid and here's the reason to be 
clear.

634
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:07,860
It's all about fear.
When people are afraid,

635
00:28:08,430 --> 00:28:11,850
they make bad decisions,
that simply human nature.

636
00:28:12,360 --> 00:28:16,440
Fear makes bad decisions.
Fear is the root of aggression.

637
00:28:17,460 --> 00:28:22,460
Government at the end of his law,
at the end of every law was a couple of 

638
00:28:22,460 --> 00:28:23,400
minor exceptions,
but almost every law,

639
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:27,480
the of everyone is a guy or a Gal with a
gun put you in a cage,

640
00:28:28,020 --> 00:28:32,370
which means by default law is force.
Government is force.

641
00:28:32,790 --> 00:28:33,930
Now,
should we never used for us?

642
00:28:34,120 --> 00:28:34,410
No,
no.

643
00:28:34,411 --> 00:28:36,950
You can use force to defend your rights 
property.

644
00:28:37,290 --> 00:28:40,290
He didn't use force,
but when you are afraid,

645
00:28:41,250 --> 00:28:44,910
you're first step is force,
so when you are afraid,

646
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:50,120
you're first step is government and 
that's what happens in the states like 

647
00:28:50,120 --> 00:28:50,120
New York,
California.

648
00:28:50,120 --> 00:28:51,780
The first answer is government.
It's the old,

649
00:28:51,900 --> 00:28:54,180
there oughta be a law.
I don't like this.

650
00:28:54,350 --> 00:28:56,460
They want to be a law.
This is wrong.

651
00:28:56,790 --> 00:29:01,790
There were to be a law and that culture 
has been part of us for at least 50 

652
00:29:01,790 --> 00:29:01,790
years,
if not more.

653
00:29:01,790 --> 00:29:04,680
I mean just decades upon decades has 
been that way.

654
00:29:05,070 --> 00:29:07,050
I see the same thing,
right?

655
00:29:07,260 --> 00:29:12,260
Oh,
someone's smoking in front of me to 

656
00:29:12,260 --> 00:29:12,450
think the same way until I was 
enlightening.

657
00:29:12,451 --> 00:29:13,440
Go.
Oh no,

658
00:29:13,441 --> 00:29:15,450
that's a bad idea.
Why would I do that?

659
00:29:15,680 --> 00:29:20,680
But I thought I was righteous and the 
thing that we have to remember is we 

660
00:29:20,680 --> 00:29:24,360
also idealize the idea of democracy.
We idolize when we voted,

661
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:27,360
there's a law.
The story I love,

662
00:29:27,361 --> 00:29:30,750
I tell this whole time,
I was speaking to an Ip attorney,

663
00:29:30,751 --> 00:29:35,751
intellectual property attorney,
and she was talking to me about 

664
00:29:35,751 --> 00:29:35,751
intellectual property law and I'm making
this up.

665
00:29:35,751 --> 00:29:37,710
I don't remember the actual rules.
So she said something,

666
00:29:37,711 --> 00:29:38,940
and again,
I'm not a lawyer,

667
00:29:39,030 --> 00:29:41,440
I'm going to just say numbers.
So we have some,

668
00:29:42,040 --> 00:29:47,040
you know,
after the copyright law is 95 years 

669
00:29:47,040 --> 00:29:49,360
after the person's death.
It was something like that and I said 95

670
00:29:49,390 --> 00:29:50,560
years after her death,
she goes,

671
00:29:50,590 --> 00:29:50,980
yeah.

672
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:52,600
I said,
what a terrible law.

673
00:29:52,810 --> 00:29:54,670
It's horrible.
She said,

674
00:29:54,730 --> 00:29:55,900
yeah,
but it's a law.

675
00:29:57,070 --> 00:29:59,470
I know.
I'm not doubting that your lawyer.

676
00:29:59,471 --> 00:30:02,920
I'm sure you know the law.
I'm sure that's true and it's a bad law.

677
00:30:03,470 --> 00:30:08,470
She said,
but you understand we had to change our 

678
00:30:08,470 --> 00:30:10,120
laws to match international law.
So now we match international law.

679
00:30:10,180 --> 00:30:11,110
And I said,
great,

680
00:30:11,230 --> 00:30:16,230
that's a really bad international law.
She looked like she was angry at me 

681
00:30:16,810 --> 00:30:21,640
because in her eyes,
law equals righteousness that the same.

682
00:30:22,270 --> 00:30:27,270
There's no difference.
International law equals extra 

683
00:30:27,270 --> 00:30:27,670
righteousness.
It's just,

684
00:30:27,671 --> 00:30:31,180
it's amazing.
So she was mad at me because in her eyes

685
00:30:31,450 --> 00:30:32,170
I was a heretic.

686
00:30:33,670 --> 00:30:36,400
That's how she saw me.
Now she didn't make the law.

687
00:30:36,401 --> 00:30:41,401
It wasn't her idea.
She was not congress congressperson who 

688
00:30:41,401 --> 00:30:41,401
did it.
No,

689
00:30:41,401 --> 00:30:42,850
she's simply a priest of the law and I'm
a heretic.

690
00:30:43,390 --> 00:30:45,460
And she was mad at me,
they might think,

691
00:30:45,461 --> 00:30:49,060
well that's when we lawyers guide 
department of buildings in New York.

692
00:30:49,510 --> 00:30:51,040
I'm talking to him,
this guys educated,

693
00:30:51,130 --> 00:30:52,810
smart,
credentialed.

694
00:30:53,950 --> 00:30:54,610
I say to him,
I say,

695
00:30:54,611 --> 00:30:59,611
I'm,
I'm kinda curious about the landmarking 

696
00:30:59,611 --> 00:31:01,531
law and if you may not know landmarking 
in New York City is when you can 

697
00:31:01,531 --> 00:31:01,531
actually,
you know,

698
00:31:01,531 --> 00:31:04,680
kind of a community can say this 
property's landmarked and now nothing 

699
00:31:04,680 --> 00:31:06,130
can be done to that property unless the 
community agrees.

700
00:31:06,670 --> 00:31:11,670
Lots of people want it.
They want to protect their community so 

701
00:31:11,670 --> 00:31:11,670
that developers can come in and do it 
all the time.

702
00:31:11,670 --> 00:31:12,860
Is that just for a building or is that 
actually.

703
00:31:12,910 --> 00:31:14,880
Can it be for like a group of buildings 
are a part of thing?

704
00:31:14,980 --> 00:31:19,980
I think it's one building at a time.
I'm pretty sure it's one property at a 

705
00:31:19,980 --> 00:31:19,980
time.
Okay.

706
00:31:19,980 --> 00:31:21,070
But actually doing groups,
but I think it's one property at a time.

707
00:31:21,610 --> 00:31:26,610
So you can also have that happen to you 
without you wanting the community can 

708
00:31:26,841 --> 00:31:28,810
just landmark your property.
That can happen.

709
00:31:28,980 --> 00:31:33,980
And it has happened a couple times.
So now documentary landmarks your 

710
00:31:33,980 --> 00:31:33,980
property.
So I totally,

711
00:31:33,980 --> 00:31:33,980
I said,
how is that okay?

712
00:31:33,980 --> 00:31:36,040
I don't understand how that works.
And the guy told me,

713
00:31:36,041 --> 00:31:41,041
Larry,
it's the same lower use for when that 

714
00:31:41,041 --> 00:31:41,041
building is condemned.
And I said,

715
00:31:41,041 --> 00:31:41,530
ah,
that makes sense.

716
00:31:41,531 --> 00:31:42,850
Right?
Condemning makes sense.

717
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:46,120
If a building collapses,
thousands could die.

718
00:31:46,420 --> 00:31:49,210
Totally makes sense.
I see a victim got that law.

719
00:31:49,300 --> 00:31:52,040
I'm in good when it comes to 
landmarking,

720
00:31:52,350 --> 00:31:54,220
where's victim?
He went,

721
00:31:54,221 --> 00:31:54,400
no,
no,

722
00:31:54,401 --> 00:31:55,030
no.
You don't understand.

723
00:31:55,031 --> 00:31:58,480
It's the same law we use.
I get that.

724
00:31:58,540 --> 00:32:01,620
Totally get it.
Where's the victim laterally?

725
00:32:01,621 --> 00:32:06,621
It's St Law because in his eyes again,
law equals righteousness.

726
00:32:07,630 --> 00:32:12,630
This is the mindset we have in for many 
Americans and we have to break that 

727
00:32:12,630 --> 00:32:14,350
mindset.
The idea that just because it's a law,

728
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:15,940
does it make it righteous?
By default,

729
00:32:16,210 --> 00:32:19,000
lots of laws have been bad and been 
overturned in a wrong.

730
00:32:19,210 --> 00:32:21,520
Lots of them are low,
doesn't make it righteous,

731
00:32:21,820 --> 00:32:23,260
but we say it will be voted

732
00:32:25,340 --> 00:32:26,450
now.
Becomes okay now.

733
00:32:26,600 --> 00:32:27,620
Great.
I vote.

734
00:32:27,621 --> 00:32:29,390
You give me all your stuff.
Awesome.

735
00:32:29,780 --> 00:32:32,030
I guess you have to be very self now.
You can have all my stuff.

736
00:32:32,230 --> 00:32:33,110
Well there we go.
But.

737
00:32:33,130 --> 00:32:38,130
But I voted so we've got a problem.
I try to tell people when I go through 

738
00:32:38,130 --> 00:32:41,831
New York state,
I'm trying to change the concept of 

739
00:32:41,831 --> 00:32:41,831
right now,
government,

740
00:32:41,831 --> 00:32:44,450
most of the time it's just this.
It enforces the will of the majority.

741
00:32:45,770 --> 00:32:50,770
I want government's primary purpose to 
be to instead defend the rights of the 

742
00:32:50,770 --> 00:32:55,541
individual specifically when you have 
localization from the local believers 

743
00:32:55,541 --> 00:32:58,310
who will pop up because local bullies 
will always pop up.

744
00:32:59,030 --> 00:33:04,030
But now local bullies are validated by 
the big government because you voted so 

745
00:33:05,391 --> 00:33:07,310
local.
Bullies have more power than ever.

746
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:10,760
Instead,
the state government should be defending

747
00:33:10,761 --> 00:33:13,220
the individual against local police 
against him.

748
00:33:13,221 --> 00:33:18,221
That domain against property tax hikes,
against speeding tickets that are $405 

749
00:33:19,370 --> 00:33:21,980
for a speeding ticket.
This would be defending them against the

750
00:33:21,981 --> 00:33:23,300
local bullies.
But we're not.

751
00:33:23,460 --> 00:33:28,460
All right,
so let's talk about some of the unique 

752
00:33:28,460 --> 00:33:28,690
issues in New York because although a 
lot of states have,

753
00:33:28,691 --> 00:33:30,930
you know,
a big city and then a rural area,

754
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:35,960
New York really has it.
And I remember growing up in New York 

755
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:35,960
where there were always,
you know,

756
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:38,500
I'd read Newsday was the long island 
paper and they were always talking about

757
00:33:38,501 --> 00:33:43,501
the fights between New York City and 
Albany because we have this huge rural 

758
00:33:43,501 --> 00:33:47,701
upstate area.
The upstate area right now is extremely 

759
00:33:47,701 --> 00:33:48,760
economically depressed.
I went to Suny Binghamton.

760
00:33:48,761 --> 00:33:51,320
I know the area pretty well.
Um,

761
00:33:51,490 --> 00:33:54,880
how do you deal with someone that wants 
to be the governor of the state,

762
00:33:54,881 --> 00:33:58,210
the chief executor of the state.
How do you deal with having,

763
00:33:58,630 --> 00:34:03,630
what is it?
Something around like 8 million people 

764
00:34:03,630 --> 00:34:03,630
and a half million people in New York 
City.

765
00:34:03,630 --> 00:34:04,960
Sixty dollars million in metro area.
If few includes pots,

766
00:34:04,980 --> 00:34:06,040
Connecticut,
New Jersey,

767
00:34:06,041 --> 00:34:08,770
Long Island parts of a Westchester 
County.

768
00:34:08,771 --> 00:34:10,330
So it's about 16 million metro area.

769
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:13,330
It's New York City is the largest city 
in America.

770
00:34:13,900 --> 00:34:18,340
And by far it's over double La.
La is the second and it's over double.

771
00:34:18,790 --> 00:34:20,980
So it is by far the largest city in 
America.

772
00:34:21,190 --> 00:34:24,610
There are more people in one of our 
boroughs then at least 10 states,

773
00:34:25,080 --> 00:34:30,080
just one of our girls.
There are more people in New York City 

774
00:34:30,080 --> 00:34:30,080
than there are in 40 states.
That's how big we are.

775
00:34:30,080 --> 00:34:31,180
We're massive there.
Are there,

776
00:34:31,181 --> 00:34:36,181
um,
but not just that New York City is very 

777
00:34:36,181 --> 00:34:38,461
unique in that about one third of its 
population is not born in the country 

778
00:34:38,461 --> 00:34:40,950
and another about one third is not born 
in India,

779
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:44,170
in the city.
So we are literally a magnet for talent,

780
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:48,580
which is why because we're a magnet for 
talent and we have 60 million people who

781
00:34:48,581 --> 00:34:50,830
are possible candidates for,
you know,

782
00:34:50,920 --> 00:34:52,780
customers,
candidates for,

783
00:34:52,781 --> 00:34:56,380
um,
for jobs we can basically be a communist

784
00:34:56,381 --> 00:34:58,450
state and still function,
right?

785
00:34:58,450 --> 00:35:00,190
Because we have so many advantages.
Our,

786
00:35:00,250 --> 00:35:05,250
our advantages are so high.
It's people say how can you possibly 

787
00:35:05,250 --> 00:35:09,631
work in New York City?
There's so many advantages and we have 

788
00:35:09,631 --> 00:35:11,290
the massive vantage of finance.
I mean finance is a massive put up.

789
00:35:11,291 --> 00:35:13,510
New Exam.
Manhattan's infrastructure is huge.

790
00:35:13,570 --> 00:35:15,820
So basically the machine just keeps 
churning.

791
00:35:15,821 --> 00:35:17,170
That's correct.
Through people,

792
00:35:17,171 --> 00:35:18,250
through jobs,
through everything else.

793
00:35:18,251 --> 00:35:19,960
So the more we,
the more you push out,

794
00:35:19,961 --> 00:35:21,790
the more you bring in.
Absolutely.

795
00:35:21,860 --> 00:35:22,430
So the,
the,

796
00:35:22,450 --> 00:35:26,260
so it just keeps happening.
The rest of the state is not that way at

797
00:35:26,261 --> 00:35:27,280
all.
Less than New York,

798
00:35:27,281 --> 00:35:28,090
central,
New York,

799
00:35:28,270 --> 00:35:28,960
northern,
uh,

800
00:35:28,990 --> 00:35:30,720
northern country,
southern tier,

801
00:35:30,760 --> 00:35:32,320
Long Island,
very different,

802
00:35:32,650 --> 00:35:37,650
different.
And one of the things I'm doing is I'm 

803
00:35:37,650 --> 00:35:37,650
trying to show them something very 
important.

804
00:35:37,890 --> 00:35:42,890
This has to come down to localization.
It's making government smaller in 

805
00:35:42,890 --> 00:35:43,830
general,
right?

806
00:35:43,831 --> 00:35:46,500
Neil says several problems as you talked
about the city from the rest,

807
00:35:46,501 --> 00:35:49,200
which is very different,
but also 70 percent of New Yorkers don't

808
00:35:49,201 --> 00:35:51,480
vote in certain counties upstate.

809
00:35:51,540 --> 00:35:54,030
Only one in seven votes they've given 
up.

810
00:35:54,540 --> 00:35:56,190
They've just given up.
It's learned helplessness,

811
00:35:56,580 --> 00:35:57,870
right?
They just totally given up.

812
00:35:58,140 --> 00:36:03,140
And we have over 100,000
New Yorkers leaving our state every 

813
00:36:03,140 --> 00:36:07,190
single year over 100,000,
but a million in the last eight years 

814
00:36:07,190 --> 00:36:07,190
walking away.
Now you say,

815
00:36:07,190 --> 00:36:12,021
Oh my God.
And walking away New York City must be 

816
00:36:12,021 --> 00:36:12,021
getting killed.
No nukes.

817
00:36:12,021 --> 00:36:12,120
He's about imagine,
same or higher,

818
00:36:12,630 --> 00:36:14,850
all coming from upstate western New 
York,

819
00:36:14,851 --> 00:36:16,470
all coming from,
of leaving his youth flight.

820
00:36:16,760 --> 00:36:21,760
All our young people are gonna.
Educate and leaving or leaving an 

821
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:21,760
educating someplace else,
not coming back.

822
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:23,160
Is that mostly a tax issue?
I'm sorry?

823
00:36:23,161 --> 00:36:25,560
Is that mostly a tax issue or to drive?
It's everything.

824
00:36:25,650 --> 00:36:28,410
It's high cost of living,
new opportunities.

825
00:36:28,650 --> 00:36:29,520
Those who,
these combined,

826
00:36:30,030 --> 00:36:35,030
but it can't change because we have a 
thing called unfunded mandates and is 

827
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:38,070
devastating our state and what does that
mean?

828
00:36:38,071 --> 00:36:43,071
That means in a given county up to 95,
sometimes over 100 percent of the budget

829
00:36:44,130 --> 00:36:47,580
is already mandated by Albany or capital
or by DC.

830
00:36:48,450 --> 00:36:51,420
So who's running the county?
Someone else's.

831
00:36:51,480 --> 00:36:56,480
Why show up?
We have local cities and towns where we 

832
00:36:56,480 --> 00:36:58,020
don't have enough people to fill all the
billets for people.

833
00:36:58,021 --> 00:36:59,070
Show up.
Okay.

834
00:36:59,071 --> 00:37:01,080
I guess you're the chair.
I'm the vice chair.

835
00:37:01,081 --> 00:37:03,570
You're cemetery because we're here.
Right,

836
00:37:03,571 --> 00:37:05,790
and no one else shows up ever.
Unless they're angry,

837
00:37:06,540 --> 00:37:10,830
so angry will show up against them.
It by default becomes US versus them.

838
00:37:11,220 --> 00:37:15,150
They go in their backroom,
crate their edx and announced the people

839
00:37:15,630 --> 00:37:18,360
and we have local tyrants,
but more importantly,

840
00:37:18,540 --> 00:37:23,540
how do I can think that in my county 
when I have to buy all these things as 

841
00:37:23,540 --> 00:37:25,890
mandated by the state and by the federal
government had to raise money somehow.

842
00:37:26,220 --> 00:37:28,200
Only two ways.
There's a loophole in the old state.

843
00:37:28,201 --> 00:37:30,090
When it comes to property taxes,
every.

844
00:37:30,091 --> 00:37:32,340
The tax has to be voted on by the 
people.

845
00:37:32,580 --> 00:37:33,570
Property tax?
No,

846
00:37:33,600 --> 00:37:37,830
only by the council.
So officially our governor will tell you

847
00:37:37,860 --> 00:37:39,780
there's a two percent cap in property 
tax,

848
00:37:40,110 --> 00:37:42,450
but there's an exception if it's an 
emergency.

849
00:37:43,470 --> 00:37:48,470
So they go behind closed doors,
declared emergency and raise property 

850
00:37:48,470 --> 00:37:48,470
taxes nine percent.
What do they count as an emergency?

851
00:37:48,470 --> 00:37:49,680
I need money.
We on the money,

852
00:37:49,980 --> 00:37:51,690
the unfunded mandates go past our 
budget.

853
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:55,980
So two choices.
Option one is that property taxes option

854
00:37:55,981 --> 00:37:58,140
to use law enforcement as a profit 
center.

855
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:04,400
So now that parking thing that was 100 
bucks is out there in a bucks speeding 

856
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:05,100
ticket.
That was 50 bucks is now 500 bucks.

857
00:38:05,310 --> 00:38:07,290
It's so bad that a lot of places in New 
York state,

858
00:38:07,860 --> 00:38:10,950
they don't even want you to come to 
court anymore,

859
00:38:11,580 --> 00:38:16,580
so when you get a bunch of tickets they 
asked just sell the tickets off to 

860
00:38:16,580 --> 00:38:20,391
collect agency,
get thirty cents of a dollar and 

861
00:38:20,391 --> 00:38:23,511
everyone your credit because they don't 
wanna waste your time to bring you in 

862
00:38:23,511 --> 00:38:23,511
for court because you might not be able 
to pick.

863
00:38:23,511 --> 00:38:24,030
They don't care if you pay.
Yeah,

864
00:38:24,390 --> 00:38:29,390
they're actually getting the money from 
the collect agency so they get a bunch 

865
00:38:29,390 --> 00:38:29,390
of tickets.
Collect agency gets it.

866
00:38:29,550 --> 00:38:34,550
You,
you go to court whenever you want with 

867
00:38:34,550 --> 00:38:34,550
them.
So.

868
00:38:34,550 --> 00:38:37,430
Okay.
So hearing everything you just said 

869
00:38:37,430 --> 00:38:37,430
there,
that's like one

870
00:38:37,430 --> 00:38:37,810
of those things you that it makes so 
much sense.

871
00:38:37,811 --> 00:38:41,440
It shows what the glut is,
the middle management,

872
00:38:41,530 --> 00:38:44,500
corruption and greed and all that stuff.
Not even close to that.

873
00:38:44,780 --> 00:38:45,100
No,
no.

874
00:38:45,110 --> 00:38:46,600
I know.
Well,

875
00:38:46,630 --> 00:38:49,150
let's just pause for one second though 
because because as you're saying it,

876
00:38:49,151 --> 00:38:50,470
I'm thinking,
man,

877
00:38:50,471 --> 00:38:55,471
this is the type of stuff that I think 
if people really understood they would 

878
00:38:55,471 --> 00:38:59,460
be pissed about,
but it's like one of those things that 

879
00:38:59,460 --> 00:39:00,130
as a candidate explaining this to people
and getting people to be like,

880
00:39:00,131 --> 00:39:02,220
yes,
it is the backdoor deals.

881
00:39:03,330 --> 00:39:08,330
This is like one of those issues where 
it's not easy to put the bumper sticker 

882
00:39:08,330 --> 00:39:09,400
on and get people to get excited about.
It's not,

883
00:39:09,460 --> 00:39:10,920
I need to build that wall and whatever 
that.

884
00:39:11,180 --> 00:39:11,890
Right.
Exactly.

885
00:39:11,891 --> 00:39:13,570
Now to build that wall that he dot.
Yeah,

886
00:39:13,571 --> 00:39:14,430
exactly.
Yeah,

887
00:39:14,750 --> 00:39:19,750
so pop music.
I knew New York and saved main street 

888
00:39:19,750 --> 00:39:23,260
had been working pretty well.
I had a couple of those sayings was 

889
00:39:23,260 --> 00:39:23,260
saying which one actually lands.
We're using those right now.

890
00:39:23,260 --> 00:39:23,860
Seeing how they work,
but yeah,

891
00:39:23,861 --> 00:39:25,930
I mean this is a big problem.
Of course people don't show up.

892
00:39:25,931 --> 00:39:26,680
Of course you will.
Don't vote.

893
00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:28,780
I think changes,
right?

894
00:39:28,781 --> 00:39:33,781
But here's another problem.
We have counties where you have one 

895
00:39:33,781 --> 00:39:36,331
third of the population of Medicaid,
one third of Medicare and the dwindling 

896
00:39:36,331 --> 00:39:37,390
population.
The tax burden going up,

897
00:39:37,880 --> 00:39:40,780
New York state has a budget of about 
$170,000,000,000

898
00:39:41,010 --> 00:39:44,130
and compared to California,
I'm sure the title however I'm going to.

899
00:39:44,190 --> 00:39:49,190
I'm going to.
I'm going to compare that to other 

900
00:39:49,190 --> 00:39:49,190
state.
Florida,

901
00:39:49,190 --> 00:39:51,100
Florida has more people than us.
Half the budget now.

902
00:39:51,101 --> 00:39:52,910
The argument I always get is,
but lowery,

903
00:39:52,980 --> 00:39:55,150
New York is expect or something on a 
services.

904
00:39:55,450 --> 00:39:58,720
Then why a hundred thousand $100 leaving
every year and half of them are going to

905
00:39:58,721 --> 00:40:03,721
Florida.
So many New Yorkers are leaving our 

906
00:40:03,721 --> 00:40:03,880
state that in the Carolinas they have a 
name for us.

907
00:40:04,260 --> 00:40:06,940
They call us halfbacks,
Florida and halfway back,

908
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:09,270
so we're going to Carolina as we'll call
it,

909
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:11,890
half bath.
That's how common it is.

910
00:40:11,891 --> 00:40:14,320
Now we're running ever.
Every time I do an event,

911
00:40:14,410 --> 00:40:16,390
I asked two questions.
Question number one.

912
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:21,480
I say,
how many people here I think about 

913
00:40:21,480 --> 00:40:21,480
leaving New York hands always go up and 
they look around like,

914
00:40:21,480 --> 00:40:22,090
wow,
there was only one.

915
00:40:22,350 --> 00:40:25,690
No,
half the room in every place I go.

916
00:40:25,691 --> 00:40:27,430
I go to a college,
I go to a diner,

917
00:40:27,610 --> 00:40:29,800
I go to a Vfw,
is matter where I go,

918
00:40:29,830 --> 00:40:32,230
I go to American Legion,
I go someplace,

919
00:40:32,380 --> 00:40:37,380
boom.
Half the hands go up there all ready to 

920
00:40:37,380 --> 00:40:40,321
leave.
Most of them us somehow trap trap 

921
00:40:40,321 --> 00:40:40,321
because of kids shot because of job 
traffic,

922
00:40:40,321 --> 00:40:42,010
because their properties in the water,
they're trapped,

923
00:40:42,520 --> 00:40:44,050
but as soon as they can get that next 
level,

924
00:40:44,470 --> 00:40:45,550
they are gone.

925
00:40:46,060 --> 00:40:47,380
Huge problem.
Secondly,

926
00:40:47,381 --> 00:40:52,381
I asked all the time is how many of you 
have not voted in the past two election 

927
00:40:52,381 --> 00:40:54,070
cycles and those go up.
What does that mean?

928
00:40:54,071 --> 00:40:59,071
It means I'm drawing the people in 
because I'm worried about the most 

929
00:40:59,071 --> 00:41:01,030
important piece here and that is about 
impact what you do.

930
00:41:01,420 --> 00:41:04,120
How do I win this thing?
This is a winnable race.

931
00:41:04,870 --> 00:41:06,430
Six months ago I wouldn't have said 
that.

932
00:41:06,670 --> 00:41:09,490
Now I know there's at least a four 
person race.

933
00:41:09,730 --> 00:41:11,300
It's going to be his majesty,
King Cuomo.

934
00:41:11,460 --> 00:41:13,900
He will be running for sure the 
communists.

935
00:41:13,901 --> 00:41:16,690
How Hok is room for the winning party,
the sacrificial lamb.

936
00:41:16,691 --> 00:41:19,210
We're run by Republicans who cannot win,
just fighting for second place.

937
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:23,490
Who is Manara?
He's a downstate Republican.

938
00:41:23,770 --> 00:41:27,670
They pick two downstate republicans to 
run for governor and the governor.

939
00:41:27,790 --> 00:41:30,450
Clearly they surrendered.
Let's just get as much as we can.

940
00:41:30,490 --> 00:41:35,490
New York City and try to get second 
place they've surrendered and then at 

941
00:41:35,490 --> 00:41:35,490
least four.

942
00:41:35,490 --> 00:41:36,700
It's possible the act from sex and the 
city.

943
00:41:36,720 --> 00:41:38,030
Nixon will stay in.
Maybe.

944
00:41:38,031 --> 00:41:39,930
I don't know if she will after she loses
to a.

945
00:41:39,980 --> 00:41:41,030
She may stay.
I may not.

946
00:41:41,031 --> 00:41:46,031
So two maybe and then maybe someone else
a minor out of Syracuse may not as 

947
00:41:46,031 --> 00:41:46,340
independent as possible.
I could have six,

948
00:41:46,341 --> 00:41:50,660
but at least for New York state's a 
plurality state means all I need is more

949
00:41:50,661 --> 00:41:53,630
than the rest.
There are about $18 million.

950
00:41:53,631 --> 00:41:56,540
19 million New Yorkers.
About 12 men that are eligible to vote.

951
00:41:56,960 --> 00:42:01,340
Only about four to 5 million every vote.
One point 5 million votes.

952
00:42:01,580 --> 00:42:03,260
And the governor.
Thirty percent.

953
00:42:03,540 --> 00:42:04,760
I'm the governor,
Larry.

954
00:42:04,761 --> 00:42:05,900
That's huge.
It is.

955
00:42:05,901 --> 00:42:07,910
But Gary,
John's got a 175,000

956
00:42:07,911 --> 00:42:11,210
votes in my state in 2016.
He was there for five minutes.

957
00:42:11,780 --> 00:42:13,820
He showed up,
waved and walked away,

958
00:42:13,940 --> 00:42:16,340
and it was 175,000
people who said,

959
00:42:16,341 --> 00:42:18,590
I'm so sick and tired out,
vote for Gary Johnson.

960
00:42:18,590 --> 00:42:19,340
I'll do it.
I'll do it.

961
00:42:19,400 --> 00:42:21,860
I'll do it.
I live in this state.

962
00:42:22,040 --> 00:42:27,040
I campaign the state.
I've raised more money than everyone 

963
00:42:27,040 --> 00:42:29,830
except for the governor.
You tell me I can't get 10 times that 

964
00:42:29,830 --> 00:42:31,100
five times that even.
Of course I can,

965
00:42:31,490 --> 00:42:36,490
but more importantly,
you have three other people have to get 

966
00:42:36,490 --> 00:42:36,490
three types.
Number one,

967
00:42:36,490 --> 00:42:36,490
unhappy Democrats,
Republicans,

968
00:42:36,710 --> 00:42:41,710
tons of them,
but they're not my number one because 

969
00:42:41,710 --> 00:42:44,150
many of them will still go back to old 
ways because most people who vote often,

970
00:42:44,390 --> 00:42:47,000
usually both because of fear not because
of hope.

971
00:42:47,930 --> 00:42:50,240
This little free,
the other guy might win that.

972
00:42:50,241 --> 00:42:51,830
Most of them was going to go back 
through old ways.

973
00:42:51,920 --> 00:42:56,920
I get that,
but some of them won't take whatever I 

974
00:42:56,920 --> 00:42:58,381
can yet,
but the next one is the single issue 

975
00:42:58,381 --> 00:42:58,381
voter.
The person who cares,

976
00:42:58,381 --> 00:43:00,830
but only one thing and one thing only.

977
00:43:01,040 --> 00:43:03,470
I bring up many of these issues of the 
vaping industry,

978
00:43:03,800 --> 00:43:06,020
right in New York state is trying to 
crush the vaping industry.

979
00:43:06,021 --> 00:43:08,930
I don't know why they can't stand it.
Trying to destroy the vaping industry.

980
00:43:09,200 --> 00:43:10,220
Silly.
Why would you?

981
00:43:10,610 --> 00:43:11,630
Well,
if you're a vaper,

982
00:43:12,140 --> 00:43:13,270
that's important.
You have your own.

983
00:43:13,271 --> 00:43:14,990
If you own a vape shop,
that's your livelihood.

984
00:43:15,410 --> 00:43:20,410
I could be saying,
I want to support the industry and a 

985
00:43:20,410 --> 00:43:20,410
kick puppies in the streets filed with 
the public thing.

986
00:43:20,410 --> 00:43:25,270
Just really care about it.
It's all so issues like that,

987
00:43:25,340 --> 00:43:27,290
right?
People who father's rights,

988
00:43:27,350 --> 00:43:30,650
people have been crushed by family law,
have an entire policy for fixing.

989
00:43:30,651 --> 00:43:33,740
The family court system has been 
completely revamped their fathers,

990
00:43:33,741 --> 00:43:38,210
at least a million who've been crushed 
and destroyed by the family court system

991
00:43:38,211 --> 00:43:39,500
in New York state.
I mean just devastated.

992
00:43:39,710 --> 00:43:42,950
They have higher suicide rates.
They've been their families ever jail,

993
00:43:43,040 --> 00:43:44,510
horribleness,
right?

994
00:43:44,750 --> 00:43:46,790
These people care about that issue.
I will fix that.

995
00:43:46,791 --> 00:43:51,791
In Law.
I'm the only ones supporting the 

996
00:43:51,791 --> 00:43:51,791
industry.
The only to my family law.

997
00:43:51,791 --> 00:43:52,250
These people vote for me because that's 
what they care about.

998
00:43:52,700 --> 00:43:54,620
People who in New York state who've 
gotten Duis,

999
00:43:54,680 --> 00:43:58,160
three of us are more and they lose their
license in perpetuity,

1000
00:43:58,161 --> 00:44:03,161
no matter what.
There are some people who've paid the 

1001
00:44:03,161 --> 00:44:03,161
time in jail,
done role,

1002
00:44:03,890 --> 00:44:07,160
and I've been clean for five years.
Clean.

1003
00:44:07,220 --> 00:44:09,350
You have straighten your life out.
You've done your time,

1004
00:44:09,351 --> 00:44:12,140
you've paid your time in jail,
and you brought your license back,

1005
00:44:12,570 --> 00:44:17,570
and if they leave New York state,
then the state won't get my license 

1006
00:44:17,570 --> 00:44:18,230
because it was revoked.
They may never drive again.

1007
00:44:18,500 --> 00:44:23,500
No,
you're not giving them a chance to be a 

1008
00:44:23,500 --> 00:44:23,500
functioning member.
They can't.

1009
00:44:23,500 --> 00:44:23,540
That has to go and people say,
but lottery,

1010
00:44:23,541 --> 00:44:24,650
why would you support these industries?

1011
00:44:24,710 --> 00:44:26,270
We're number one of these issues.
Why?

1012
00:44:26,450 --> 00:44:27,650
It's right.
I'm a libertarian.

1013
00:44:28,400 --> 00:44:30,470
That's what we do.
I am righteous.

1014
00:44:30,471 --> 00:44:32,640
Of course I libertarians always,
and it's the thing,

1015
00:44:32,641 --> 00:44:33,480
most of them,
they'll get.

1016
00:44:33,780 --> 00:44:35,880
Libertarians always have the moral high 
ground.

1017
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:39,450
Always the act like we don't,
but we always do.

1018
00:44:39,870 --> 00:44:41,970
I know that.
So I take the moral high ground.

1019
00:44:41,971 --> 00:44:42,750
It's mine.
I own it,

1020
00:44:42,960 --> 00:44:47,960
so I take it and it's right.
I'm in the pocket of big Dui pocket.

1021
00:44:49,590 --> 00:44:52,800
Of course not right?
It shows people that I care,

1022
00:44:52,801 --> 00:44:57,801
that it makes sense,
and they know that when I get into 

1023
00:44:57,801 --> 00:44:57,801
power,
I'm still going to support his people.

1024
00:44:57,801 --> 00:44:57,930
I'm not going.
I'm not in it for the money.

1025
00:44:58,650 --> 00:45:03,650
These people vote tons of these issues.
They will jump on board and they will 

1026
00:45:03,650 --> 00:45:03,650
vote,
but more than that,

1027
00:45:03,650 --> 00:45:05,820
there are 8 million New Yorkers who 
don't vote.

1028
00:45:06,690 --> 00:45:07,980
They vote because of hope.

1029
00:45:08,730 --> 00:45:10,530
Bernie taught us this and trump told us 
this.

1030
00:45:10,800 --> 00:45:12,180
Trump gave,
gave the right hope.

1031
00:45:12,450 --> 00:45:14,040
Bernie gave the left hope.
Now,

1032
00:45:14,041 --> 00:45:15,690
if the Democratic Party wasn't so 
broken,

1033
00:45:15,900 --> 00:45:20,900
Bernie would have been the nominee and 
it would've been hope versus hope and 

1034
00:45:20,900 --> 00:45:20,900
hope.
One,

1035
00:45:20,900 --> 00:45:22,860
I think you've been corrupt.
Yes.

1036
00:45:22,890 --> 00:45:25,420
I don't know if it's broken or corrupt.
It was intentional.

1037
00:45:25,760 --> 00:45:29,040
They were both either,
but it would have been hope versus hope.

1038
00:45:29,190 --> 00:45:34,190
Hope one hope gets people out of their 
bed and stopped playing video games and 

1039
00:45:34,190 --> 00:45:34,980
show up.
How do you make that happen?

1040
00:45:34,981 --> 00:45:37,260
By having events,
I'm doing events all the time.

1041
00:45:37,440 --> 00:45:40,110
People are showing up to my events who 
didn't vote,

1042
00:45:40,140 --> 00:45:43,970
which means they will show up at the 
polling booth trumpet.

1043
00:45:44,130 --> 00:45:45,750
Brian told us this.
I'm copying.

1044
00:45:45,751 --> 00:45:47,040
Then it's working.
Look,

1045
00:45:47,041 --> 00:45:49,170
look what got you here.
I mean your guys.

1046
00:45:49,260 --> 00:45:51,240
I started seeing it more and more and 
more on twitter.

1047
00:45:51,240 --> 00:45:53,220
Next thing I know,
I think you tweeted at me or one of your

1048
00:45:53,221 --> 00:45:55,080
guys tweeted at me and we made it 
happen.

1049
00:45:55,110 --> 00:45:57,420
Absolutely on,
yes,

1050
00:45:57,980 --> 00:45:59,280
but here's the next four pieces.
Now.

1051
00:45:59,340 --> 00:46:01,620
Now if I just get 10 percent of the 8 
million,

1052
00:46:01,950 --> 00:46:04,110
800,000,
I'm halfway there.

1053
00:46:04,410 --> 00:46:05,250
Tell us what.
I'll pick up.

1054
00:46:05,340 --> 00:46:06,840
I'm the governor.
I get 20 percent.

1055
00:46:07,050 --> 00:46:09,480
It's a blowout.
This is a winnable race.

1056
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:13,350
There were four arenas.
Anyone that has to win on to get elected

1057
00:46:13,410 --> 00:46:15,480
for first one,
social media.

1058
00:46:15,990 --> 00:46:20,990
Six months ago I would have thought I 
could never win because Cuomo has so 

1059
00:46:20,990 --> 00:46:20,990
much more money than I have,
right?

1060
00:46:20,990 --> 00:46:21,000
I thought,
no way I could win,

1061
00:46:21,210 --> 00:46:22,620
but he.
His social media isn't competent.

1062
00:46:23,070 --> 00:46:25,560
We are winning on social media that is 
on mobile and this is proof of it.

1063
00:46:25,660 --> 00:46:28,170
We are killing it in social media.
We are winning hands down,

1064
00:46:28,560 --> 00:46:29,400
but that's just one.

1065
00:46:29,850 --> 00:46:32,380
The second one is traditional media.
This one I struggle in.

1066
00:46:32,800 --> 00:46:35,100
Tourism is tough for me.
They go for the popular.

1067
00:46:35,101 --> 00:46:37,170
Cynthia Nixon was popular or the 
governor.

1068
00:46:37,410 --> 00:46:42,410
They go with the tried and true.
It's hard to get it and then I live in 

1069
00:46:42,410 --> 00:46:42,410
New York City,
New York City.

1070
00:46:42,410 --> 00:46:44,220
Something's always going on Tuskegee 
coverage,

1071
00:46:44,320 --> 00:46:47,820
so the to get round that I'd be going 
upstate western New York.

1072
00:46:47,821 --> 00:46:50,070
Smaller towns where that to Joyce's,
right?

1073
00:46:50,130 --> 00:46:55,130
Some some guy lost his cow or not.
I was coming to town shower,

1074
00:46:56,400 --> 00:46:58,560
so I've been doing that so I get a lot 
of local media,

1075
00:46:58,561 --> 00:47:01,830
but I've also learned that local media 
also often overlaps.

1076
00:47:02,700 --> 00:47:07,700
They also have social media presence.
Some of the writers are shared among 

1077
00:47:07,700 --> 00:47:10,851
different papers,
so I'm getting a lot of press in the 

1078
00:47:10,851 --> 00:47:11,010
local paper,
so I'm doing better traditional media.

1079
00:47:11,310 --> 00:47:12,660
I don't know if I can actually win it.
Maybe,

1080
00:47:12,661 --> 00:47:13,680
maybe not,
but that's one.

1081
00:47:13,680 --> 00:47:18,680
That's one issue that I'm fighting on.
I'm trying new tactics to win on that 

1082
00:47:18,680 --> 00:47:18,680
one.
The next one's events,

1083
00:47:18,680 --> 00:47:20,790
as I talked about right now,
no one else is doing events.

1084
00:47:21,060 --> 00:47:26,060
I'm the only one doing it.
I'm the only one out shaking hands and 

1085
00:47:26,060 --> 00:47:29,091
kissing babies and meeting people and 
I'm winning events like there's no 

1086
00:47:29,091 --> 00:47:29,091
tomorrow.
I'm winning an events.

1087
00:47:29,091 --> 00:47:33,891
Right.
The issue is they will eventually begin 

1088
00:47:33,891 --> 00:47:36,061
doing events when they do will I will.
I have ramped up to speed or not some 

1089
00:47:36,131 --> 00:47:39,160
questionable on those two.
The last one's debates.

1090
00:47:39,460 --> 00:47:41,770
If you see me debate,
I have no problem debating.

1091
00:47:41,920 --> 00:47:44,230
I will crush them on debates,
so I will.

1092
00:47:44,231 --> 00:47:47,500
When social media and debates.
The question is can I,

1093
00:47:47,501 --> 00:47:51,610
when traditional media and our events,
if I win three out of four,

1094
00:47:51,730 --> 00:47:52,750
I'm the governor.
Now.

1095
00:47:52,751 --> 00:47:57,751
You said you said a key if there,
which was if you debate what's the 

1096
00:47:57,751 --> 00:48:02,521
debate situation for the rebates because
traditionally for always in the dates 

1097
00:48:02,770 --> 00:48:07,770
they were in 2014,
2010 traditionally are to be 

1098
00:48:07,770 --> 00:48:07,770
Libertarian,
green,

1099
00:48:07,770 --> 00:48:07,770
Democrat,
Republican,

1100
00:48:07,770 --> 00:48:12,540
so odds are debates as a very high and 
they keep you in the debate regardless 

1101
00:48:12,540 --> 00:48:12,540
of polling.

1102
00:48:12,540 --> 00:48:13,500
After that one,
once I ran,

1103
00:48:13,510 --> 00:48:18,510
it's for all the way across,
but they probably only do one to two or 

1104
00:48:18,510 --> 00:48:18,510
three,
but who wanted to be the only.

1105
00:48:18,510 --> 00:48:22,620
Oh,
that's the debate in October one and 

1106
00:48:22,620 --> 00:48:22,620
October.
It's all man.

1107
00:48:22,620 --> 00:48:22,870
So that's like,
that's like the show up.

1108
00:48:23,020 --> 00:48:24,490
That's it.
Win,

1109
00:48:24,491 --> 00:48:25,700
lose or draw right there.
Yeah.

1110
00:48:26,020 --> 00:48:26,800
I don't mind it.
I liked it.

1111
00:48:26,801 --> 00:48:27,670
I was like,
that is a good odds.

1112
00:48:28,060 --> 00:48:30,130
What kind of support are you getting 
from the party itself?

1113
00:48:30,910 --> 00:48:31,660
Oh,
was good as it can be.

1114
00:48:31,661 --> 00:48:32,170
I mean,
look,

1115
00:48:32,171 --> 00:48:37,171
it's New York State Libertarians.
There aren't that many of them to small 

1116
00:48:37,171 --> 00:48:37,171
party.
Uh,

1117
00:48:37,171 --> 00:48:37,390
there are city,
two counties in New York.

1118
00:48:37,391 --> 00:48:42,391
We have about 20 affiliates,
so we have 42 counties that didn't have 

1119
00:48:42,391 --> 00:48:42,391
affiliates.
So it's,

1120
00:48:42,391 --> 00:48:44,380
it's not a powerful party to across the 
state.

1121
00:48:44,381 --> 00:48:46,660
We not even officially a party were 
officially a committee.

1122
00:48:47,240 --> 00:48:47,640
What do you mean?

1123
00:48:47,650 --> 00:48:48,380
Yes,
but I,

1124
00:48:48,381 --> 00:48:48,760
I,
the,

1125
00:48:48,790 --> 00:48:50,590
the,
the parties autonomous at behind me.

1126
00:48:50,591 --> 00:48:53,290
One hundred percent.
There isn't that much there.

1127
00:48:53,320 --> 00:48:54,550
What they can do,
they are doing.

1128
00:48:54,551 --> 00:48:57,880
I'm very happy with what they're doing.
I wish I'd had a party.

1129
00:48:58,030 --> 00:48:59,380
I wish had more bodies.
I do.

1130
00:48:59,381 --> 00:49:04,381
I wish I had more bodies,
but luckily getting there we are and 

1131
00:49:04,381 --> 00:49:04,381
we're getting more people from other 
states are coming.

1132
00:49:04,381 --> 00:49:08,251
Also other people are joining and for 
the first time now people are coming to 

1133
00:49:09,131 --> 00:49:11,230
the party because of me,
right.

1134
00:49:11,260 --> 00:49:14,650
Most people who join me before came to 
the party because of someone else.

1135
00:49:14,920 --> 00:49:15,580
Ron,
Paul,

1136
00:49:15,581 --> 00:49:17,110
Gary Johnson,
Harry Brown,

1137
00:49:17,350 --> 00:49:19,090
and then so my candidacy.
I jumped on board,

1138
00:49:19,720 --> 00:49:22,180
but now that I've been so active for so 
many months in New York state,

1139
00:49:22,270 --> 00:49:24,220
some people not coming to partly because
of me.

1140
00:49:24,490 --> 00:49:27,370
Those people are now building up our 
group of,

1141
00:49:27,460 --> 00:49:28,390
of,
of uh,

1142
00:49:28,690 --> 00:49:29,530
of activists.

1143
00:49:29,560 --> 00:49:34,560
So I am getting more and more again,
what I'm getting from the people is 

1144
00:49:34,560 --> 00:49:34,840
amazing.
I do more of them though.

1145
00:49:34,990 --> 00:49:39,990
So we are getting there.
Do you sense that there is a rebirth of 

1146
00:49:39,990 --> 00:49:40,930
liberty in this country in general?
I mean,

1147
00:49:40,931 --> 00:49:45,931
I can tell from what I'm out now on the 
road and touring and the response I get 

1148
00:49:45,931 --> 00:49:50,071
to this show and the amount of emails I 
get in twitter that people are talking 

1149
00:49:50,071 --> 00:49:50,290
about liberty.
Again,

1150
00:49:50,291 --> 00:49:52,330
they're talking about it's not just the 
tea party anymore.

1151
00:49:52,331 --> 00:49:54,190
Talking about liberty,
about liberty,

1152
00:49:54,191 --> 00:49:57,130
talking about freedom.
You talk about the founding documents.

1153
00:49:57,370 --> 00:50:00,550
People are actually reinvigorated about 
this stuff.

1154
00:50:00,580 --> 00:50:03,130
What moves people is two things.
One,

1155
00:50:03,640 --> 00:50:08,620
they feel like things are so broken and 
then to someone gives them hope.

1156
00:50:09,550 --> 00:50:11,440
Revolutions as they say installed,
was it built on?

1157
00:50:11,441 --> 00:50:12,580
Hope?
They are.

1158
00:50:12,610 --> 00:50:13,360
It's true,
right?

1159
00:50:13,570 --> 00:50:15,340
The,
the Russians stayed,

1160
00:50:15,400 --> 00:50:15,570
what?

1161
00:50:15,580 --> 00:50:17,320
Three hundred years being oppressed,
whatever it was,

1162
00:50:17,321 --> 00:50:22,321
foreign ears being oppressive as 
peasants and serves and so there was 

1163
00:50:22,321 --> 00:50:24,871
some hope.
Then the communist gave them hope and 

1164
00:50:24,871 --> 00:50:24,871
they revolted.
It has to be hope,

1165
00:50:24,871 --> 00:50:29,460
but it wasn't a communist.
Countries might have been around for a 

1166
00:50:29,460 --> 00:50:29,460
bit.
It was London,

1167
00:50:29,460 --> 00:50:30,110
right?
It was an individual.

1168
00:50:30,980 --> 00:50:35,900
People bring people to revolutions.
People give other people hope.

1169
00:50:36,230 --> 00:50:38,810
We're finding better messengers now than
we've ever had.

1170
00:50:39,770 --> 00:50:41,690
It's not just rumble,
right?

1171
00:50:41,750 --> 00:50:45,560
It's a lot of us are doing this and I'm 
hoping if you've seen my campaign,

1172
00:50:45,740 --> 00:50:48,080
I'm doing my best.
Half of my team is not in New York.

1173
00:50:48,560 --> 00:50:52,070
That's on purpose,
so a purpose because I want to make sure

1174
00:50:52,071 --> 00:50:56,770
that my [inaudible] seven directors and 
about 50 active volunteers and about 200

1175
00:50:56,771 --> 00:51:00,860
and winks and I'm purposely doing that 
because I want people to be able to grow

1176
00:51:00,861 --> 00:51:04,970
that infrastructure so that in 2020 we 
have seven campaign managers,

1177
00:51:05,930 --> 00:51:06,680
active campaign.

1178
00:51:06,710 --> 00:51:10,280
We run a real campaign who not do things
like this who don't make things work.

1179
00:51:10,380 --> 00:51:12,770
The betrayal part is not happening.
Infrastructure we needed.

1180
00:51:13,220 --> 00:51:18,220
If we have better infrastructure,
we have more people like me who want to 

1181
00:51:18,220 --> 00:51:18,220
do this.
Right.

1182
00:51:18,220 --> 00:51:19,670
People don't run because they have to 
run by themselves.

1183
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:21,030
So infrastructure.
Yeah,

1184
00:51:21,560 --> 00:51:22,330
but now I can say,
no,

1185
00:51:22,331 --> 00:51:23,420
no.
Here's your team.

1186
00:51:24,020 --> 00:51:29,020
Better people will run and they'll run 
better candidacies that run better 

1187
00:51:29,020 --> 00:51:29,960
campaigns and when they do that,
more people will see them,

1188
00:51:30,200 --> 00:51:32,780
will be more people to the movement.
I think there is a rise,

1189
00:51:32,960 --> 00:51:34,280
but it's because we're having better 
candidates.

1190
00:51:34,730 --> 00:51:36,860
Are you tracking Austin Petersen out in 
Missouri?

1191
00:51:36,920 --> 00:51:38,930
I'm a fan,
but he's been here.

1192
00:51:38,970 --> 00:51:40,760
We're friends.
I think he's doing great work.

1193
00:51:40,761 --> 00:51:42,920
Last I saw a poll just in the last 
couple of weeks.

1194
00:51:42,921 --> 00:51:44,720
I mean,
it looks like he's beaming mccaskill.

1195
00:51:44,800 --> 00:51:49,800
I,
I think that's one of the type of ones 

1196
00:51:49,800 --> 00:51:50,870
and Ben potentially years as well that I
agree with you in that for sure.

1197
00:51:51,080 --> 00:51:51,860
That it's like,
man,

1198
00:51:51,861 --> 00:51:55,640
if one of these guys breakthrough,
I just wish he put an elbow to his name.

1199
00:51:56,510 --> 00:51:58,490
So I think he had.
Well I think he first,

1200
00:51:58,500 --> 00:51:59,800
you know,
he definitely is a libertarian.

1201
00:51:59,820 --> 00:52:00,920
There's no doubt about that.
And I think,

1202
00:52:00,921 --> 00:52:01,640
yeah,
I'm a fan.

1203
00:52:01,700 --> 00:52:03,140
Yes.
Doing forward.

1204
00:52:03,141 --> 00:52:04,400
I'm on record.
I was,

1205
00:52:04,630 --> 00:52:06,590
I was probably the only guy on the,
on the,

1206
00:52:06,591 --> 00:52:11,591
uh,
in the living and leadership who said 

1207
00:52:11,591 --> 00:52:11,591
please stay.
I openly what I call them.

1208
00:52:11,591 --> 00:52:11,840
I want them to stay.
I wanted him to stay.

1209
00:52:11,850 --> 00:52:13,250
And what did,
what did he say to that?

1210
00:52:13,410 --> 00:52:15,480
Is it just real politic?
So Joseph,

1211
00:52:15,530 --> 00:52:16,010
he's like,
look,

1212
00:52:16,011 --> 00:52:17,110
everyone's telling me to.
You're like,

1213
00:52:17,150 --> 00:52:19,030
you're like one of the only guys telling
me to go libertarian.

1214
00:52:19,090 --> 00:52:20,390
Yeah.
I was one of the only guy.

1215
00:52:20,391 --> 00:52:22,040
It's true.
So at the end of the day,

1216
00:52:22,041 --> 00:52:24,500
I still want to be a libertarian,
but at the end of the day,

1217
00:52:24,920 --> 00:52:26,000
you still want them to win.

1218
00:52:26,060 --> 00:52:27,730
Of course.
Clearly,

1219
00:52:27,790 --> 00:52:31,430
yes.
Feel yes,

1220
00:52:31,610 --> 00:52:32,530
of course.
I wanted to win.

1221
00:52:32,540 --> 00:52:37,540
Yes.
When I'd rather have him on mccaskill 

1222
00:52:37,540 --> 00:52:37,540
and Senate.
It's not even close.

1223
00:52:37,940 --> 00:52:39,500
Not even close.
Of course not.

1224
00:52:39,560 --> 00:52:41,080
Of course I wanna know what I.
I'm asking them.

1225
00:52:41,090 --> 00:52:42,170
Of course.
Of course.

1226
00:52:42,171 --> 00:52:43,130
I want him to win.
Yes.

1227
00:52:43,280 --> 00:52:44,190
I Miss Saying,
Oh God,

1228
00:52:44,220 --> 00:52:45,830
I'm selfish.
I'd rather them have nobody's name,

1229
00:52:46,340 --> 00:52:47,250
but I'll take him an hour.
Oh,

1230
00:52:47,260 --> 00:52:48,110
Saito.
I'll deal.

1231
00:52:48,140 --> 00:52:53,140
I'll deal with them in our LLC.
So I'll tell you one of my fears about 

1232
00:52:53,140 --> 00:52:54,410
what could potentially happen with the 
libertarians because I do.

1233
00:52:54,590 --> 00:52:57,230
You can see I'm with you on on so much 
of this stuff.

1234
00:52:57,290 --> 00:52:59,810
And even though again,
as I call myself a classical liberal,

1235
00:52:59,811 --> 00:53:01,370
there's plenty of room for agreement 
here.

1236
00:53:01,400 --> 00:53:02,210
Okay,
great.

1237
00:53:02,260 --> 00:53:07,260
And where there is,
where there might be little 

1238
00:53:07,260 --> 00:53:07,260
disagreement.
That's rich,

1239
00:53:07,260 --> 00:53:07,420
right?
Well that's a great place to do.

1240
00:53:07,520 --> 00:53:12,520
Okay.
What I'm a little concerned about is 

1241
00:53:12,520 --> 00:53:12,520
that the movement of liberty is going to
grow and grow and grow.

1242
00:53:12,520 --> 00:53:15,800
It's going to be real nice.
You'll probably do pretty well if,

1243
00:53:15,810 --> 00:53:17,990
if not when you'll do pretty well.
Austin,

1244
00:53:17,991 --> 00:53:22,991
if not when will do pretty well.
I think there were a couple other 

1245
00:53:22,991 --> 00:53:25,361
candidates around that are going to do 
pretty well and then it will grow into 

1246
00:53:25,361 --> 00:53:28,811
something that nationally come 20,
20 is going to be actually more viable 

1247
00:53:29,131 --> 00:53:34,131
than it was even under Gary Johnson.
They'll get someone that's probably 

1248
00:53:34,131 --> 00:53:34,131
younger and more tech savvy and 
whatever.

1249
00:53:34,131 --> 00:53:38,781
It'll be someone kind of cool and uh,
and that they are going to then take 

1250
00:53:38,781 --> 00:53:43,071
like they're going to pull it some 
unheard of number for libertarians out 

1251
00:53:43,071 --> 00:53:43,590
of national level,
something like 15 percent.

1252
00:53:43,620 --> 00:53:45,180
And we're gonna win electoral votes in 
20,

1253
00:53:45,181 --> 00:53:46,770
20.
So all good.

1254
00:53:47,530 --> 00:53:48,990
We are going to an electoral votes.

1255
00:53:49,110 --> 00:53:54,110
So I'm with Ya and I agree,
but do you see why I see the danger 

1256
00:53:54,110 --> 00:53:57,561
there too was dangerous.
The oncoming danger would be that you'd 

1257
00:53:57,561 --> 00:54:00,681
be pulling all of those votes from the 
right and that you end up help.

1258
00:54:01,260 --> 00:54:06,260
Now I know this is not a defense of the 
right and I got what I what if you then 

1259
00:54:08,971 --> 00:54:12,420
end up with some.
Seriously good.

1260
00:54:12,421 --> 00:54:13,290
Yeah.
Good.

1261
00:54:13,291 --> 00:54:14,980
Yeah.
Sell me on this very clear.

1262
00:54:15,150 --> 00:54:16,950
We have two choices.
Option one,

1263
00:54:17,280 --> 00:54:22,280
stay in this slow road to oblivion,
which is where we're going now or shake 

1264
00:54:22,291 --> 00:54:27,291
things up and get them to happen here.
Someone asked where the night I was at 

1265
00:54:27,291 --> 00:54:27,291
an event.
I was at a,

1266
00:54:27,291 --> 00:54:30,741
um,
a sportsman's event of the night in 

1267
00:54:30,741 --> 00:54:30,741
Suffolk County last night.
And the guy said,

1268
00:54:30,741 --> 00:54:30,920
well,
Larry,

1269
00:54:30,930 --> 00:54:35,930
we have,
what if you take a lot from the 

1270
00:54:35,930 --> 00:54:35,930
Republican?
I said,

1271
00:54:35,930 --> 00:54:37,200
I hope I tear him to pieces.

1272
00:54:37,380 --> 00:54:39,480
I hope I,
I hope he gets five percent.

1273
00:54:39,930 --> 00:54:40,950
Oh my God.
What happened?

1274
00:54:41,190 --> 00:54:44,940
Then Republicans will learn their lesson
and have to be Republicans.

1275
00:54:45,330 --> 00:54:47,850
They can't be Democrat lite anymore.
Good.

1276
00:54:48,060 --> 00:54:49,620
I hope.
I hope that happens.

1277
00:54:49,621 --> 00:54:50,400
Let it happen.
I don't care.

1278
00:54:50,520 --> 00:54:51,660
Oh,
the Democrats get killed.

1279
00:54:51,690 --> 00:54:53,040
Get that smashed.
Good.

1280
00:54:53,160 --> 00:54:55,560
Maybe we don't have to care about civil 
liberties.

1281
00:54:56,250 --> 00:54:59,460
If Libertarians do well,
regardless of who's crushed,

1282
00:54:59,880 --> 00:55:04,880
whoever gets crushed,
their lesson has to be learned or they 

1283
00:55:04,880 --> 00:55:04,880
disappear.
They disappear.

1284
00:55:04,890 --> 00:55:06,270
We replaced them.
Awesome.

1285
00:55:06,540 --> 00:55:08,340
They don't disappear.
They get better.

1286
00:55:08,820 --> 00:55:13,260
There's nothing but good.
I asked crushing either side or both.

1287
00:55:13,320 --> 00:55:14,910
Well,
I guess whatever the Republicans.

1288
00:55:14,970 --> 00:55:16,740
So what?
There'll be better Republicans,

1289
00:55:17,270 --> 00:55:18,790
Democrats.
So what they'll be,

1290
00:55:18,791 --> 00:55:20,010
but Democrats.
It doesn't matter.

1291
00:55:20,070 --> 00:55:25,070
Yeah,
I guess it's the hammer that you 

1292
00:55:25,070 --> 00:55:25,070
ultimately need.
That's correct.

1293
00:55:25,070 --> 00:55:28,131
My,
my fear would be that then because I 

1294
00:55:28,131 --> 00:55:30,891
believe the left has gone so far left 
that the idea of potentially helping 

1295
00:55:31,051 --> 00:55:36,051
them put in policies that would be a 180
degrees from everything you just said 

1296
00:55:36,150 --> 00:55:36,390
there.

1297
00:55:36,540 --> 00:55:41,540
That would put in all the deblazio stuff
that you hate in New York City and all 

1298
00:55:41,540 --> 00:55:41,940
that.
That I would really,

1299
00:55:41,941 --> 00:55:46,941
really fear that,
but you just view it as almost a 

1300
00:55:46,941 --> 00:55:48,951
necessary evil to myself.
Now you're assuming that when this 

1301
00:55:48,951 --> 00:55:50,340
happens,
people jump on board.

1302
00:55:50,490 --> 00:55:52,290
They don't.
They give up [inaudible].

1303
00:55:52,320 --> 00:55:55,500
New York is an example of that.
Seventy percent don't vote.

1304
00:55:56,370 --> 00:55:58,590
The people don't actually like these 
ideas.

1305
00:55:58,890 --> 00:56:01,410
They've given up.
They think there's no hope.

1306
00:56:01,530 --> 00:56:03,090
So they've given up.
Guess what?

1307
00:56:03,240 --> 00:56:03,930
Here comes,
Mr.

1308
00:56:04,020 --> 00:56:09,020
Hope this opens the door for me so it 
happens.

1309
00:56:09,961 --> 00:56:14,961
And Twenty,
20 libertarians are amazing and we 

1310
00:56:14,961 --> 00:56:17,750
crushed the right it does happen.
And as a whatever Bernie is the 

1311
00:56:17,750 --> 00:56:18,150
president,
whatever the case may be,

1312
00:56:18,630 --> 00:56:20,400
all the people have no hope.
When 20,

1313
00:56:20,401 --> 00:56:21,780
22 comes around for the,
for the,

1314
00:56:21,810 --> 00:56:22,330
for the,
um,

1315
00:56:22,470 --> 00:56:27,010
Senate races and for the House races,
you will watch libertarians say,

1316
00:56:27,011 --> 00:56:28,710
see what happened,
hope.

1317
00:56:28,710 --> 00:56:32,770
And you will watch a sleeping a power in
22 and then 20,

1318
00:56:32,771 --> 00:56:33,850
24,
boom.

1319
00:56:33,851 --> 00:56:36,160
You'll watch the presidency.
Good,

1320
00:56:36,880 --> 00:56:38,680
good and Democrat to be afraid of.
They won't.

1321
00:56:38,740 --> 00:56:41,760
The other thing,
we know everything and they'll lose it.

1322
00:56:41,761 --> 00:56:46,761
The loss of Hillary,
that was that we know everything and 

1323
00:56:46,761 --> 00:56:49,591
trump beat them.
Or they'll change either way too when I 

1324
00:56:49,591 --> 00:56:50,980
have no worries.
Yes,

1325
00:56:51,010 --> 00:56:52,540
I hope you're right.
I don't care which one happens.

1326
00:56:52,870 --> 00:56:54,580
Crush both.
Crush either is irrelevant.

1327
00:56:55,060 --> 00:56:57,880
It's the right answer.
It's the only way you make the change.

1328
00:56:58,090 --> 00:56:59,890
Whenever you have to have positive 
change,

1329
00:56:59,891 --> 00:57:03,490
there has to be some disruption.
And we're afraid of disruption.

1330
00:57:03,810 --> 00:57:08,810
You can't.
Let's just let people know that it will 

1331
00:57:08,810 --> 00:57:11,131
be disruption.
Let's hold their hand through it and 

1332
00:57:11,131 --> 00:57:11,131
boom it besides.
Awesome.

1333
00:57:11,370 --> 00:57:16,370
Alright,
let's just knock out a couple of 

1334
00:57:16,370 --> 00:57:17,661
policies and then uh,
then I send you back to New York to get 

1335
00:57:17,661 --> 00:57:17,661
cracking.

1336
00:57:17,661 --> 00:57:18,100
I do,
I worked with.

1337
00:57:18,270 --> 00:57:19,150
Yeah.
Um,

1338
00:57:19,151 --> 00:57:21,040
okay.
So I think on the drug stuff,

1339
00:57:21,070 --> 00:57:22,690
marijuana,
you're for legalization,

1340
00:57:22,691 --> 00:57:24,490
correct.
Not just marijuana,

1341
00:57:24,491 --> 00:57:27,220
but also hemp and I want it to be 
regulated.

1342
00:57:27,221 --> 00:57:29,950
As I say this all the time for farmers 
like onions,

1343
00:57:30,580 --> 00:57:33,340
I don't want to write new rules and 
regulations that will take forever.

1344
00:57:33,430 --> 00:57:35,320
I want us to take onions,
cut and paste,

1345
00:57:36,010 --> 00:57:41,010
hemp marijuana go.
And the reason why I want that is our 

1346
00:57:41,010 --> 00:57:41,860
farmers in New York state are struggling
desperately,

1347
00:57:42,430 --> 00:57:44,720
so why don't we allow them.
If they want you to grow hemp,

1348
00:57:44,721 --> 00:57:46,420
to grow marijuana,
they want to enjoy.

1349
00:57:46,421 --> 00:57:47,500
Go ahead,
do what they want,

1350
00:57:47,890 --> 00:57:52,890
but not just that.
People talking about marijuana and 

1351
00:57:52,890 --> 00:57:52,890
cannabis products as being expensive and
taxed.

1352
00:57:52,890 --> 00:57:55,200
If it's regular,
like onions grow in your backyard,

1353
00:57:56,200 --> 00:57:58,750
don't care growing your back yard will 
allow.

1354
00:57:58,780 --> 00:58:00,280
How do we celebrate a tax the hell out 
of it?

1355
00:58:00,490 --> 00:58:01,930
No.
Then we create a black market,

1356
00:58:01,931 --> 00:58:06,370
which we have now officially you can get
medical marijuana in New York officially

1357
00:58:06,371 --> 00:58:09,760
you can one place in New York City and a
massive black market.

1358
00:58:10,450 --> 00:58:13,710
Right?
So instead like helpful sor seller,

1359
00:58:13,750 --> 00:58:14,680
like you know what?
It's helpful store,

1360
00:58:14,970 --> 00:58:17,290
but a regulation.
There's no relation to health plus those

1361
00:58:17,291 --> 00:58:22,291
either.
We're all the desks from all the health 

1362
00:58:22,291 --> 00:58:22,291
was.
Well GNC got so whatever.

1363
00:58:22,291 --> 00:58:22,810
They're all the desks.
None.

1364
00:58:22,930 --> 00:58:27,930
I think I went over the data with data 
and create a team maybe once we go for 

1365
00:58:27,930 --> 00:58:31,790
hitting the gym a long time ago.
So the FDA has killed far more people 

1366
00:58:31,790 --> 00:58:32,980
than every health food store ever 
created.

1367
00:58:33,280 --> 00:58:34,870
So really like that.
So it's fine.

1368
00:58:34,871 --> 00:58:36,490
Put a thing,
not regular by FDA.

1369
00:58:36,760 --> 00:58:37,750
Good luck.
Whatever.

1370
00:58:37,840 --> 00:58:38,800
I don't care.
Do what you want.

1371
00:58:39,200 --> 00:58:44,200
Uh,
let's just do a couple of other hot 

1372
00:58:44,200 --> 00:58:44,200
button ones.

1373
00:58:44,200 --> 00:58:45,310
So a guns where you at?
What does that mean?

1374
00:58:45,940 --> 00:58:50,940
While we were yet know if people in New 
York City itself want farm where 

1375
00:58:50,940 --> 00:58:51,330
treatment?
Yeah,

1376
00:58:51,400 --> 00:58:56,400
that's fine.
The fact it's a big deal in New York 

1377
00:58:56,400 --> 00:59:00,620
that you may or may not know what the 
safe act came out after sandy hook and 

1378
00:59:00,620 --> 00:59:01,390
it basically made a bunch of equipment 
illegal,

1379
00:59:01,750 --> 00:59:04,960
so it made a bunch of people who own 
firearms legally,

1380
00:59:05,650 --> 00:59:10,650
criminals overnight,
and now they put you in jail and not 

1381
00:59:10,650 --> 00:59:10,650
just that.
If you have a magazine,

1382
00:59:10,650 --> 00:59:10,870
have a member of the rule,
right?

1383
00:59:11,020 --> 00:59:13,000
If you're a magazine can fit 11 rounds 
in it,

1384
00:59:13,930 --> 00:59:17,570
you,
you are now a violent felon according to

1385
00:59:17,580 --> 00:59:21,320
state law to Baba Felon.
That's how bad is.

1386
00:59:21,440 --> 00:59:26,440
The safe act is terrible and now we're 
talking about idea of taking guns for 

1387
00:59:26,440 --> 00:59:29,021
people.
So I told you if the children in school 

1388
00:59:29,021 --> 00:59:32,151
with he did,
he says that the child is a problem 

1389
00:59:32,151 --> 00:59:32,151
child.

1390
00:59:32,151 --> 00:59:35,230
They go take your guns if you're 
mentally ill to your guns and they in 

1391
00:59:35,230 --> 00:59:36,380
New York state includes,
if you're transgendered,

1392
00:59:37,460 --> 00:59:39,320
she don't get to have guns.
If you're transgender in New York state.

1393
00:59:39,770 --> 00:59:41,420
I mean it's embarrassing how bad this 
thing is.

1394
00:59:41,421 --> 00:59:43,130
It's terrible.
That has to be repealed.

1395
00:59:43,190 --> 00:59:44,900
I can't repeal the law.
I'm the governor.

1396
00:59:45,170 --> 00:59:48,060
So I knew it was like the beginning of,
pardon people who were convicted of it,

1397
00:59:48,070 --> 00:59:50,840
but a thousand people in New York state 
have convicted of safe act.

1398
00:59:51,270 --> 00:59:54,290
I'm a infringements about about a 
thousand.

1399
00:59:54,620 --> 00:59:56,420
I'll begin partnering them within the 
First Ninety days.

1400
00:59:56,480 --> 01:00:01,480
So we have people in jail in New York 
right now who were doing something 

1401
01:00:01,480 --> 01:00:01,610
completely legally.
The law change.

1402
01:00:01,611 --> 01:00:03,610
And then they were put in jail.
That correct that.

1403
01:00:03,630 --> 01:00:04,520
That is incredible.
Yes,

1404
01:00:04,521 --> 01:00:05,780
that's correct.
And it's guns,

1405
01:00:05,810 --> 01:00:06,940
therefore it's evil.
Yeah.

1406
01:00:07,700 --> 01:00:09,680
Remember how New York state works and 
York state works.

1407
01:00:09,920 --> 01:00:10,400
It's evil.

1408
01:00:10,400 --> 01:00:14,630
Hit it with a stick.
That's our first always first reaction.

1409
01:00:15,050 --> 01:00:16,160
What is that?
He with a stick.

1410
01:00:16,520 --> 01:00:18,140
So we do.
So yes.

1411
01:00:18,141 --> 01:00:20,360
That's true.
Actually met James Time at the first guy

1412
01:00:20,361 --> 01:00:25,361
who got his first conviction.
He's a three time convicted felon I 

1413
01:00:25,361 --> 01:00:25,361
think,
if not mistaken.

1414
01:00:25,361 --> 01:00:28,070
So I'll be in pardoning when I sought to
pardon.

1415
01:00:28,580 --> 01:00:31,070
That will let people know I'm serious.
Stop.

1416
01:00:31,460 --> 01:00:36,460
That was going to happen when I pardon.
Reason why people don't pardon early is 

1417
01:00:36,460 --> 01:00:36,740
because what's going to happen when I 
pardon a hundred people?

1418
01:00:37,250 --> 01:00:42,250
What I'm gonna do something stupid.
They're going to go rob a liquor store 

1419
01:00:42,250 --> 01:00:43,160
or a car or whatever,
do something bad,

1420
01:00:43,161 --> 01:00:44,600
beat their spouse,
insert thing here.

1421
01:00:44,810 --> 01:00:49,810
What are they going to do?
I get it's going to happen and when it 

1422
01:00:49,810 --> 01:00:49,810
happens,
they're going to blame me.

1423
01:00:49,810 --> 01:00:49,810
I'm going to say,
governor sharp.

1424
01:00:49,810 --> 01:00:50,840
You already have a guy.

1425
01:00:50,870 --> 01:00:55,870
This liquor store got robbed because you
let a guy out because he was a violent 

1426
01:00:55,870 --> 01:00:57,020
felon and I'm going to say several 
things.

1427
01:00:57,090 --> 01:00:59,270
One,
I don't care when I.

1428
01:00:59,271 --> 01:01:02,780
When everyone's gonna hate me.
I'm going to be attacked everyday by the

1429
01:01:02,781 --> 01:01:05,660
assembly everyday by the Senate.
Everyday by the press,

1430
01:01:05,810 --> 01:01:07,220
I'm going to have an assembly and the 
Senate.

1431
01:01:07,221 --> 01:01:10,130
That's completely against me.
That's one of a bazillion things.

1432
01:01:10,170 --> 01:01:11,720
Won't care,
but not just that.

1433
01:01:13,190 --> 01:01:14,750
Yes.
One guy did something wrong.

1434
01:01:15,050 --> 01:01:20,050
Put that guy in jail for that.
I even had people write that they got 

1435
01:01:20,050 --> 01:01:24,850
off and our nation was built on the idea
that it would be better for a guilty 

1436
01:01:24,850 --> 01:01:26,410
person,
go free than an innocent person to be in

1437
01:01:26,411 --> 01:01:30,950
prison will get 99 out.
I'm okay with that and when I do that,

1438
01:01:30,980 --> 01:01:35,980
the assembly will see that I will take 
the heat for them and when they see that

1439
01:01:36,860 --> 01:01:41,860
in 2019 they'll repeal in 20 slash 20 
because I've given them the air cover 

1440
01:01:42,110 --> 01:01:47,110
and on top of that I'm going to veto any
bill that has any safe act enforcement 

1441
01:01:47,110 --> 01:01:48,260
funding gone.

1442
01:01:48,500 --> 01:01:53,500
They won't bother putting it in because 
I'll veto it and they will now have to 

1443
01:01:53,500 --> 01:01:55,520
double down on it as a separate piece 
that will crush them on the right.

1444
01:01:55,790 --> 01:02:00,790
They won't do it,
so that means you will not be enforced 

1445
01:02:00,790 --> 01:02:02,270
and I'll begin and I will actually be in
pardoning people as they get arrested.

1446
01:02:02,670 --> 01:02:04,200
Prosecutors love it.
Easy going.

1447
01:02:04,250 --> 01:02:09,250
Easy conviction.
Cops hated the cops will love that I'm 

1448
01:02:09,250 --> 01:02:10,490
not enforcing anymore and they will 
happily on it.

1449
01:02:11,060 --> 01:02:14,030
It becomes useless in 2019 gets repealed
in 2020.

1450
01:02:14,600 --> 01:02:19,600
By the way,
I copy the same model for marijuana 

1451
01:02:19,600 --> 01:02:19,600
laws.
Same model,

1452
01:02:19,600 --> 01:02:21,230
same thing.
Begin begin to a pardon.

1453
01:02:21,240 --> 01:02:23,970
People who are convicted of nonviolent 
marijuana possessions.

1454
01:02:24,210 --> 01:02:25,920
Stop enforcing it.
Same idea,

1455
01:02:25,921 --> 01:02:27,930
same concept.
They see how it works.

1456
01:02:27,931 --> 01:02:28,410
Twenty,
20,

1457
01:02:28,411 --> 01:02:29,140
repealed.
Yeah,

1458
01:02:29,370 --> 01:02:34,370
it's just incredible.
You found and I followed that by the 

1459
01:02:34,370 --> 01:02:34,370
way,
the,

1460
01:02:34,370 --> 01:02:37,310
the,
the veto and that model is the Gary 

1461
01:02:37,310 --> 01:02:37,310
Johnson model.

1462
01:02:37,310 --> 01:02:37,310
Alright.
GimMe Gimme.

1463
01:02:37,310 --> 01:02:42,200
One more thing.
That's an important issue to you before 

1464
01:02:42,200 --> 01:02:42,200
we were at.
There's tons of them,

1465
01:02:42,200 --> 01:02:42,780
but those are good.
I mentioned the other one,

1466
01:02:42,781 --> 01:02:44,220
the vaping,
the Duis.

1467
01:02:44,370 --> 01:02:49,370
I mentioned that also.
I'm also the biggest idea though of all 

1468
01:02:49,370 --> 01:02:51,240
of them is the unfunded mandate.
We have to localize government.

1469
01:02:51,630 --> 01:02:56,630
If we take away,
if we take away the unfunded mandates 

1470
01:02:56,630 --> 01:02:57,870
now individual counties can decide.
In Baltimore they want people to say the

1471
01:02:57,871 --> 01:02:58,950
same thing,
but Larry,

1472
01:02:59,550 --> 01:03:03,120
if that happens then I won't get what I 
want.

1473
01:03:03,450 --> 01:03:08,450
Now you can just show them before if you
like what your county's doing.

1474
01:03:08,670 --> 01:03:10,950
Don't change a thing.
Show up,

1475
01:03:10,980 --> 01:03:14,610
vote yes on everything and you're good,
but if you don't,

1476
01:03:14,611 --> 01:03:17,040
you can change it.
That's really the key to libertarianism.

1477
01:03:17,041 --> 01:03:22,041
You might have to be involved.
You might show up and talk to your 

1478
01:03:22,041 --> 01:03:24,540
neighbor and tell them why you care 
about a certain policy or issue.

1479
01:03:24,750 --> 01:03:26,790
You might have to care about stuff.
Yes.

1480
01:03:26,791 --> 01:03:29,410
Larry can't someone else do it.
They couldn't do it.

1481
01:03:29,460 --> 01:03:34,460
Now the other thing is a sale time,
but laterally dead Kennedys will make 

1482
01:03:34,460 --> 01:03:35,160
arrows.
They'll make mistakes and fail.

1483
01:03:35,310 --> 01:03:37,560
Yes,
but we're all failing.

1484
01:03:37,561 --> 01:03:40,470
Now.
The state's bleeding to death.

1485
01:03:41,280 --> 01:03:43,650
I want to follow the Google model.
The Google model says,

1486
01:03:44,180 --> 01:03:49,180
20 percent of your time can be used in 
whatever you want as long as you're 

1487
01:03:49,180 --> 01:03:49,180
transparent until but as what you're 
doing.

1488
01:03:49,530 --> 01:03:51,870
Counties do what you want.
However we want to vote,

1489
01:03:52,500 --> 01:03:54,330
but transparency of almost see what's 
happening.

1490
01:03:55,200 --> 01:03:56,250
We do that.
What happens?

1491
01:03:56,310 --> 01:03:57,510
Some fail,
some succeed,

1492
01:03:57,960 --> 01:03:59,610
but we then learn what works and what 
doesn't.

1493
01:03:59,970 --> 01:04:04,970
We shift and adjust regions.
We'll figure out what works for each 

1494
01:04:04,970 --> 01:04:04,970
region and we'll actually have 
improvement.

1495
01:04:04,970 --> 01:04:09,561
This,
this disruption that happens before you 

1496
01:04:09,561 --> 01:04:09,561
have success,
that's happens in business.

1497
01:04:09,561 --> 01:04:12,180
It happens in every and habits in life,
everything,

1498
01:04:12,480 --> 01:04:14,400
so we do that,
become a sharing state,

1499
01:04:14,520 --> 01:04:15,330
sharing economy.

1500
01:04:15,780 --> 01:04:18,250
We change how things work.
Being on top of that,

1501
01:04:18,251 --> 01:04:23,251
that's one part.
The second thing you do is you add 

1502
01:04:23,251 --> 01:04:23,251
what's called a charitable choice credit
for your taxes.

1503
01:04:23,660 --> 01:04:28,660
What that is is 20 bucks.
That would be your tax money going to 

1504
01:04:28,660 --> 01:04:28,660
the tax man anyway,
your choice.

1505
01:04:29,070 --> 01:04:30,660
You can give it to a nonprofit if you 
want to,

1506
01:04:30,920 --> 01:04:32,700
if you want to.
It's going out of your pocket anyway.

1507
01:04:33,150 --> 01:04:36,150
You want to go to a nonprofit,
you can plus another 2:50

1508
01:04:36,210 --> 01:04:39,310
in your own county.
So if I were in a box of your money into

1509
01:04:39,311 --> 01:04:41,640
your accounting for the sake of argument
in this area,

1510
01:04:41,670 --> 01:04:43,560
there are 40,000
people who pay taxes.

1511
01:04:43,980 --> 01:04:46,710
That's 2 million possible dollars 
voluntary.

1512
01:04:47,490 --> 01:04:48,600
If you want to do it,
do it again.

1513
01:04:48,601 --> 01:04:50,940
If you like your government,
don't change it.

1514
01:04:51,360 --> 01:04:52,380
Don't do it.
You got it,

1515
01:04:52,440 --> 01:04:53,310
you're good.
You like it,

1516
01:04:53,640 --> 01:04:55,440
but say if it is a better way for 
childcare,

1517
01:04:55,860 --> 01:04:58,050
besides the only government monopoly,
which is a disaster,

1518
01:04:58,470 --> 01:05:02,220
maybe is a better way for a glen roads,
which government is a disaster.

1519
01:05:02,310 --> 01:05:05,490
There's a better way.
A private company now can lobby you,

1520
01:05:05,810 --> 01:05:10,380
not the government because you give them
money and the more money you give,

1521
01:05:10,470 --> 01:05:11,780
the less corruption there is.
Yeah,

1522
01:05:11,850 --> 01:05:16,850
I love that.
The more transparency there is let's 

1523
01:05:16,850 --> 01:05:18,861
crush or it allows the actual counties 
to begin to prioritize as they want,

1524
01:05:19,690 --> 01:05:24,690
as they see it work.
They can make that more or less or 

1525
01:05:24,690 --> 01:05:25,150
shift.
This is the beginning part.

1526
01:05:25,151 --> 01:05:30,151
I'm talking about showing them that 
there's other ways of getting things 

1527
01:05:30,151 --> 01:05:34,051
done besides government and there's not 
a Zombie apocalypse on top of how do I 

1528
01:05:34,051 --> 01:05:38,101
also raise money or what is the 
libertarian responds to the Zombie 

1529
01:05:38,101 --> 01:05:38,101
Apocalypse?
Uh,

1530
01:05:38,101 --> 01:05:41,300
I dunno,
I guess guns clients,

1531
01:05:41,301 --> 01:05:41,840
I guess.
Yeah.

1532
01:05:42,370 --> 01:05:43,890
So there's another way of raising money 
also,

1533
01:05:43,900 --> 01:05:48,900
whichever you bring up also.
And that is naming rights on 

1534
01:05:48,900 --> 01:05:48,900
infrastructure,
right?

1535
01:05:48,900 --> 01:05:52,650
The MTA just in New York City is over 12
bridges and tunnels and right now what 

1536
01:05:52,650 --> 01:05:54,040
we've done in New York state as we've 
named one of our bridges after the Cuomo

1537
01:05:54,041 --> 01:05:56,700
family,
it's called the marrow Como Bridge.

1538
01:05:56,720 --> 01:05:59,750
Now we have which bridges that.
It's what's happened now.

1539
01:05:59,751 --> 01:06:02,020
It is now that the imperial bridge of 
the imperial family.

1540
01:06:02,460 --> 01:06:06,130
So now that has to go instead.
Let's,

1541
01:06:06,180 --> 01:06:09,280
let's leave out naming rights.
Could be the verizon bridge,

1542
01:06:09,281 --> 01:06:11,380
this sprint bridge,
the staples bridge,

1543
01:06:11,381 --> 01:06:12,460
the home depot breach.
I don't care.

1544
01:06:12,461 --> 01:06:14,260
You pick the person who wants it.
Right.

1545
01:06:14,261 --> 01:06:17,890
The company wants it now.
They do this for already for stadiums.

1546
01:06:18,280 --> 01:06:19,300
They pay 10,
20,

1547
01:06:19,301 --> 01:06:21,790
$30,000,000
a year for something used half a year.

1548
01:06:22,300 --> 01:06:24,490
This is a bridge they can choose every 
day.

1549
01:06:24,910 --> 01:06:28,110
Your name gets mentioned a hundred times
at least every morning.

1550
01:06:28,140 --> 01:06:33,140
Afternoon during rush hour on every 
radio station in a 16 million person 

1551
01:06:33,140 --> 01:06:37,171
metro area.
You're telling me companies that paid 

1552
01:06:37,171 --> 01:06:39,321
literally billions of dollars in 
marketing every year went up 

1553
01:06:39,321 --> 01:06:39,321
$100,000,000
in a bridge,

1554
01:06:39,340 --> 01:06:41,290
but here's a rule,
no tolls,

1555
01:06:41,860 --> 01:06:44,680
actual break for people and they control
maintenance.

1556
01:06:45,600 --> 01:06:47,320
If they control maintenance,
guess what?

1557
01:06:47,560 --> 01:06:52,560
No more corruption in the maintenance 
industry anymore because now sprints 

1558
01:06:52,560 --> 01:06:55,771
paying for not the government,
no more closing lanes at the closing 

1559
01:06:55,771 --> 01:06:55,771
lanes in bw.
Bridge goes away.

1560
01:06:55,771 --> 01:06:56,650
Sprints,
I can put up with it.

1561
01:06:57,250 --> 01:06:58,550
There's potholes,
sprints.

1562
01:06:58,551 --> 01:06:59,920
I can put up with it.
They'll follow you so you.

1563
01:07:00,430 --> 01:07:05,430
Yeah.
These are different ideas that people 

1564
01:07:05,430 --> 01:07:05,430
that we have.
The Erie Canal in New York state,

1565
01:07:05,430 --> 01:07:07,510
it's about 500 and some odd miles of 
Erie canal.

1566
01:07:07,720 --> 01:07:11,290
We can name the locks.
It's about three dozen blocks in blocks,

1567
01:07:11,860 --> 01:07:16,860
all different ideas.
There's so many ways of raising money 

1568
01:07:16,860 --> 01:07:17,980
and changing how we look at this and 
they're not perfect by any means,

1569
01:07:18,460 --> 01:07:23,460
but there are conversations we need to 
be having to ship this idea that the 

1570
01:07:23,460 --> 01:07:26,020
only way to civilization and taxation,
it isn't the only way.

1571
01:07:26,050 --> 01:07:28,570
It's a way.
It's not the only way.

1572
01:07:28,990 --> 01:07:31,750
There were other options available and 
people just don't get it.

1573
01:07:31,750 --> 01:07:36,750
You open this up.
I believe that all the time they love 

1574
01:07:36,750 --> 01:07:36,750
it,
that you ended up.

1575
01:07:36,750 --> 01:07:36,750
You Go,
oh,

1576
01:07:36,750 --> 01:07:36,750
it's great.
I like that idea and we try that.

1577
01:07:36,750 --> 01:07:38,470
Someone is gonna be tried.
This is what we want to do.

1578
01:07:38,540 --> 01:07:43,540
We shift the Way New York state runs and
the rest of the nation will follow.

1579
01:07:45,340 --> 01:07:48,670
If I just beat the Republican,
everyone will hear what I have to say.

1580
01:07:48,900 --> 01:07:51,880
I've been every TV show in the country.
They will hear what I have to say.

1581
01:07:52,030 --> 01:07:54,850
They'll hear this.
They'll start telling their people,

1582
01:07:54,970 --> 01:07:59,970
they'll start copying.
This campaign has the most possibility 

1583
01:07:59,970 --> 01:08:02,140
for impact than any other campaign in 
2018,

1584
01:08:02,920 --> 01:08:06,070
and here's what I promise you.
If I raised $2,000,000

1585
01:08:06,610 --> 01:08:08,800
on the governor,
it's that simple.

1586
01:08:09,430 --> 01:08:13,840
2 million bucks on the governor.
Done well.

1587
01:08:14,680 --> 01:08:19,680
I've enjoyed this conversation.
I think you've got the right set of 

1588
01:08:19,680 --> 01:08:19,680
ideas and I look forward to seeing what 
happens.

1589
01:08:19,680 --> 01:08:21,680
Good,
and now I'm going to send people to your

1590
01:08:21,681 --> 01:08:23,210
website because I assume you got a 
doughnut,

1591
01:08:23,211 --> 01:08:27,330
but Larry sharp.com
lottery shot with an ie.

1592
01:08:27,340 --> 01:08:32,340
The e stands for electrical.
Now I know you're really running because

1593
01:08:32,361 --> 01:08:36,050
he even pimped out the website telling 
Larry sharp.com.
