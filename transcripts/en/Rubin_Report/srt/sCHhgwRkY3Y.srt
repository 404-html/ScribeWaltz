1
00:00:04,820 --> 00:00:07,310
Ladies and Gentlemen,
Dr Jordan Peterson.

2
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:19,880
Thank you.

3
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:41,370
Norwegian say knowing further,
extroverted enthusiasm.

4
00:00:43,230 --> 00:00:44,940
That's pretty sweet.
Coming out to that,

5
00:00:44,941 --> 00:00:45,890
huh?
Yeah,

6
00:00:45,940 --> 00:00:46,820
yeah,
yeah,

7
00:00:47,150 --> 00:00:48,490
that's for sure.
Alright,

8
00:00:48,540 --> 00:00:53,540
so here's what we're going to do.
I want to go through some of the big 

9
00:00:53,540 --> 00:00:56,481
questions that I've come up with during 
the last five or six months on the road 

10
00:00:56,481 --> 00:00:57,840
with you,
which you've just been an incredible,

11
00:00:57,870 --> 00:01:01,040
truly life changing time for me.
Uh,

12
00:01:01,090 --> 00:01:04,650
and then we're going to end with Oslo as
best question.

13
00:01:05,460 --> 00:01:08,820
You've got 45 minutes and you will see.
All right,

14
00:01:09,150 --> 00:01:11,700
so first off,
so first off,

15
00:01:12,270 --> 00:01:16,650
every single night you are different and
I think tonight perhaps different,

16
00:01:16,710 --> 00:01:21,710
more different than any night so far.
How the hell do you do it?

17
00:01:22,110 --> 00:01:23,340
I honestly don't know.
I,

18
00:01:23,341 --> 00:01:25,620
you know,
I usually go back in the green room with

19
00:01:25,621 --> 00:01:27,600
you for a little bit before and about 10
minutes,

20
00:01:27,690 --> 00:01:30,120
10 minutes before showtime.
I walk out of there and you say you need

21
00:01:30,121 --> 00:01:34,110
to think for a little bit and then you 
somehow do an hour and a half summing up

22
00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:37,380
everything you think in a different way 
on any given night.

23
00:01:39,510 --> 00:01:41,940
Well,
there's some Atlanta that technically,

24
00:01:42,340 --> 00:01:43,980
you know,
the first thing is,

25
00:01:43,981 --> 00:01:48,981
is that something I tell my students,
you know,

26
00:01:49,261 --> 00:01:50,790
if,
if you want to write an essay,

27
00:01:50,791 --> 00:01:55,140
you need a problem because the essay is 
an attempt to solve a problem.

28
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:58,890
So first of all you need a problem and 
then second,

29
00:01:58,891 --> 00:02:00,960
if you're going to devote time to the 
problem,

30
00:02:00,961 --> 00:02:04,680
then it should be like,
it should be a problem.

31
00:02:04,681 --> 00:02:07,650
That is your problem.
At least a piece of it should be,

32
00:02:07,890 --> 00:02:12,890
you know,
I have students all the time and they 

33
00:02:12,890 --> 00:02:14,601
come up to me and they say,
tell me what I should write my essay 

34
00:02:14,601 --> 00:02:17,811
about.
And they're often very annoyed that I 

35
00:02:17,811 --> 00:02:17,811
haven't,
you know,

36
00:02:17,811 --> 00:02:17,811
you didn't give us a topic.
It's like,

37
00:02:18,030 --> 00:02:23,030
yes,
that's because the topic is the 

38
00:02:23,030 --> 00:02:24,300
difficult part of the assignment,
right?

39
00:02:24,301 --> 00:02:29,301
To specify the problem.
That's the difficult part of the 

40
00:02:29,301 --> 00:02:29,301
assignment.

41
00:02:29,301 --> 00:02:29,340
In fact,
when you're trying to,

42
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:34,830
when you're trying to address a complex,
let's say domain of suffering,

43
00:02:35,490 --> 00:02:40,490
the diagnosis,
which is the problem formulation is the 

44
00:02:40,490 --> 00:02:43,020
crucial cognitive step.
So if you want to write,

45
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:48,080
you need a problem and and if you want 
to write truthfully then you need a 

46
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:52,221
problem that's yours and if you want to 
write in a focused and aimed manner then

47
00:02:54,540 --> 00:02:56,790
you unite your thinking around the 
problem.

48
00:02:57,270 --> 00:03:02,080
And so one thing I always do before when
I sit backstage is I think,

49
00:03:02,081 --> 00:03:05,590
okay,
what's the problem for tonight?

50
00:03:06,020 --> 00:03:08,900
You know,
and the problem for tonight was victim.

51
00:03:09,410 --> 00:03:11,350
So it's one statements like,
okay,

52
00:03:11,351 --> 00:03:16,351
let's explore the concept of victim and 
go down as far as we possibly can.

53
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:18,880
Okay.
So then,

54
00:03:19,530 --> 00:03:24,530
well then I would say my,
I have my knowledge organized in a 

55
00:03:25,810 --> 00:03:30,810
idiosyncratic manner and that's a 
consequence of having spent.

56
00:03:32,170 --> 00:03:33,910
When I wrote,
wrote my first book,

57
00:03:33,911 --> 00:03:38,911
which was maps of meaning,
I wrote every day for three hours for 15

58
00:03:41,111 --> 00:03:46,111
years and I vowed when I started that I 
was going to make that.

59
00:03:48,610 --> 00:03:52,150
What would you say that the highest duty
that I had,

60
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:57,840
nothing was going to come before that.
And there's a certain amount of cruelty 

61
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:59,650
in that because it meant that,
you know,

62
00:03:59,651 --> 00:04:04,651
if my wife came into my office than I 
would bark at her and if my kids came 

63
00:04:04,651 --> 00:04:07,480
into my office like a junkyard dogs 
surrounded by barbed wire,

64
00:04:07,481 --> 00:04:10,330
it's like because you can always not,
right?

65
00:04:11,140 --> 00:04:16,140
It's not that important that day and 
there might be more pressing concerns 

66
00:04:16,140 --> 00:04:18,970
and they're probably including people 
who would just like to have something to

67
00:04:18,971 --> 00:04:21,330
do with you for awhile or do something 
nicer,

68
00:04:21,490 --> 00:04:23,470
have a problem fixed.
It's like,

69
00:04:23,740 --> 00:04:26,170
no,
go away.

70
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:27,790
I've got three hours.

71
00:04:27,850 --> 00:04:30,230
And so I see I,
I,

72
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:35,880
I,
I was a thief and I took that from my 

73
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:38,791
life.
And so I spent a very long time writing 

74
00:04:38,791 --> 00:04:42,220
and thinking about the hardest problem 
that I could conceptualize.

75
00:04:42,221 --> 00:04:47,221
And that was the relationship between 
the individual and the atrocity 

76
00:04:49,030 --> 00:04:52,210
committed in the service of totalitarian
possession.

77
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:54,760
It was the worst problem I could think 
of.

78
00:04:55,000 --> 00:05:00,000
How so?
I look to see what the worst thing 

79
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:04,650
people could do under the worst 
circumstances was and tried to figure 

80
00:05:04,650 --> 00:05:09,121
out why that happened.
That was step one and step two was 

81
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:14,520
having come to some determination about 
how it might happen then and having 

82
00:05:15,851 --> 00:05:19,060
learned something that I had suspected 
all along,

83
00:05:19,061 --> 00:05:24,061
which was that that capacity was part of
the individual,

84
00:05:24,641 --> 00:05:29,350
right.
Me as well as everyone else to determine

85
00:05:29,351 --> 00:05:34,351
if there was a mode of acting in the 
world that would restrict that 

86
00:05:34,351 --> 00:05:38,821
possibility so that it would no longer 
manifests itself and so I spent however 

87
00:05:40,450 --> 00:05:43,660
many hours,
$45,000

88
00:05:43,661 --> 00:05:48,661
thinking about that and that's not right
because that's how much time I spent 

89
00:05:48,661 --> 00:05:53,161
writing about it most of that time 
because I have a very obsessive mind in 

90
00:05:53,351 --> 00:05:55,330
some sense our lock on a problem.

91
00:05:55,330 --> 00:06:00,330
I can't let it go or can't let me go.
I didn't know which way to think about 

92
00:06:00,330 --> 00:06:03,980
it and so it wasn't only that I was 
writing for three hours a day.

93
00:06:03,981 --> 00:06:08,981
I was thinking about it all the time.
Right from the time I woke up until the 

94
00:06:08,981 --> 00:06:11,750
time I went to sleep and I was reading 
about it obsessively.

95
00:06:11,751 --> 00:06:14,060
You know,
I read a tremendous amount when I was in

96
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:19,480
graduate school and so the reason I'm 
telling you all of that is to answer 

97
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:22,951
this question is,
but then I spent 30 years lecturing 

98
00:06:22,951 --> 00:06:26,381
about it and you know,
I started out with my lectures fairly 

99
00:06:26,381 --> 00:06:27,140
structured because I was still wrestling
with the ideas,

100
00:06:27,141 --> 00:06:32,141
but I tried over the years to reduce the
amount of scaffolding safety wire 

101
00:06:35,030 --> 00:06:40,030
netting that was underneath me while I 
was lecturing until I got to the point 

102
00:06:40,030 --> 00:06:42,710
where I didn't need to do anything other
than sit for 10 minutes and think,

103
00:06:42,711 --> 00:06:43,940
okay,
what's the problem?

104
00:06:45,050 --> 00:06:47,870
Where am I going?
I'm exploring a solution.

105
00:06:47,871 --> 00:06:52,871
I'm not necessarily putting forward a 
pre constructed solution like it'll be 

106
00:06:53,661 --> 00:06:56,060
in the universe of solutions I've 
considered,

107
00:06:56,061 --> 00:06:57,980
but I'd like to get it sharper and 
clearer.

108
00:06:58,190 --> 00:07:03,190
So I got to the point where I could go 
from the problem through the story using

109
00:07:03,291 --> 00:07:08,291
all these things that I had already 
talked about a new and so then I can 

110
00:07:08,291 --> 00:07:12,311
sequence them.
And I think the closest analogy I can 

111
00:07:12,311 --> 00:07:13,940
think of is jazz improvisation.
It's something like that.

112
00:07:13,941 --> 00:07:18,941
You know,
an expert musician has a tremendous 

113
00:07:18,941 --> 00:07:19,300
number of hubs,
habits,

114
00:07:19,460 --> 00:07:23,390
deeply ingrained like an athlete,
same thing that,

115
00:07:23,490 --> 00:07:26,670
that,
that are part and parcel built into to,

116
00:07:26,950 --> 00:07:31,950
to him or her.
And so I have that and so then I can 

117
00:07:31,950 --> 00:07:31,950
come out and think,
okay,

118
00:07:31,950 --> 00:07:34,010
well a little of this and little of 
that,

119
00:07:34,011 --> 00:07:39,011
and that's new.
It's like each of these ideas is a 

120
00:07:39,011 --> 00:07:42,941
personality of sorts and you can let 
them have a dialogue in real time and 

121
00:07:42,941 --> 00:07:43,550
see where it goes.

122
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:44,840
And that's the story,
right?

123
00:07:44,841 --> 00:07:46,880
That's what a great author does when he 
writes a book,

124
00:07:46,881 --> 00:07:51,881
as he puts out some characters and then 
he lets the characters do whatever they 

125
00:07:51,881 --> 00:07:54,830
would do and that reveals the story.
And so I kind of do that.

126
00:07:54,831 --> 00:07:59,831
I let the ideas do what they're going to
do and see how they fight and compete 

127
00:07:59,831 --> 00:07:59,990
with one another and,
and,

128
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:04,780
and then that's see what people wanted.
Lectures,

129
00:08:06,110 --> 00:08:08,360
assuming that this is a lecture and it 
probably isn't,

130
00:08:08,361 --> 00:08:12,620
it's probably more like a strange sort 
of dialogue with the audience.

131
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:18,400
What people want in a forum like this is
they want to see thought inaction,

132
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:25,120
right?
They don't want to see something that's 

133
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:27,430
already crystallized and and dad,
which is why I did read the last time I 

134
00:08:28,311 --> 00:08:29,750
was here,
although I do that rarely,

135
00:08:30,230 --> 00:08:35,210
they want to see something.
They want to see what they want to see.

136
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:40,240
Technically speaking is something if you
thought about metaphysically as they 

137
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:41,330
want to see the logos,
inaction.

138
00:08:41,510 --> 00:08:46,510
That's really what people always want to
see and I mean that philosophically and 

139
00:08:47,301 --> 00:08:52,301
so the real time part of it,
the fact that it's not a contrived 

140
00:08:53,270 --> 00:08:58,270
performances out actually crucial to its
success and also what keeps me engaged.

141
00:08:58,651 --> 00:09:00,660
Like it's.
I don't know how these damn lectures are

142
00:09:00,661 --> 00:09:02,460
going to go when I come out here.
I think,

143
00:09:02,461 --> 00:09:03,420
okay,
victim,

144
00:09:03,630 --> 00:09:05,430
man,
that's a big problem.

145
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:06,630
Okay,
well we could,

146
00:09:06,810 --> 00:09:11,810
we could address it with this and then 
we could use this and I can play those 

147
00:09:11,810 --> 00:09:16,611
together and we can see how that goes 
and then perhaps I'll be able to draw a 

148
00:09:16,621 --> 00:09:20,970
rousing conclusion because it's hard to 
bring that to the point at the end,

149
00:09:20,971 --> 00:09:25,971
you know,
successfully to something I've got 

150
00:09:25,971 --> 00:09:25,971
better at over the tour,
which is quite fun,

151
00:09:25,971 --> 00:09:28,200
but I never don't know if it's gonna 
work.

152
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:32,310
And so I'm on edge when I come out on 
stage,

153
00:09:32,311 --> 00:09:33,270
I think,
oh my God,

154
00:09:33,271 --> 00:09:38,271
I've got a big problem here and I've got
a sorted out in 70 minutes and there's 

155
00:09:38,271 --> 00:09:38,271
all these people here.
So,

156
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:39,000
and,
and,

157
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:42,720
and,
and that makes it really tense for me in

158
00:09:42,721 --> 00:09:45,120
an exciting way.
It's an exhilarating,

159
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:47,280
you know,
it's an exhilarating challenge,

160
00:09:47,281 --> 00:09:52,281
but that also makes it alive because I 
could easily fail so.

161
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:56,900
Well.
So that's how it's lots of practice.

162
00:09:56,930 --> 00:09:59,840
And,
and then the final thing is I don't talk

163
00:09:59,841 --> 00:10:03,140
about problems that don't matter to me,
they matter,

164
00:10:03,710 --> 00:10:07,820
this victim thing that matters.
It's important fundamental.

165
00:10:08,030 --> 00:10:09,530
And so every night I come out and I 
think,

166
00:10:09,531 --> 00:10:14,531
okay,
well what's the fundamental problem for 

167
00:10:14,531 --> 00:10:16,721
tonight?
And it's a problem that affects me as 

168
00:10:16,721 --> 00:10:18,340
far as deep down as much as I can go,
you know?

169
00:10:18,590 --> 00:10:20,630
And so yeah.

170
00:10:23,470 --> 00:10:27,490
Do you know the point in life when you 
became a serious person?

171
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:32,760
And I mean,
I mean that in the best sense of it 

172
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:32,760
because when people asked me what it's 
like to be on tour with you,

173
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:33,330
I always say,
well,

174
00:10:33,331 --> 00:10:38,170
he takes life seriously and it's making 
me take life more seriously.

175
00:10:38,171 --> 00:10:41,260
And I think it's making these people 
take life more seriously.

176
00:10:41,261 --> 00:10:42,700
Do you remember the moment that that 
happened?

177
00:10:42,740 --> 00:10:45,260
Yes.
Can you tell me that moment?

178
00:10:45,860 --> 00:10:47,060
Yes,
I can.

179
00:10:48,100 --> 00:10:52,010
Yeah.
So it was in I think 19,

180
00:10:52,011 --> 00:10:57,011
83.
And this is a strange story.

181
00:10:58,650 --> 00:11:01,010
Um,
I came home from a party,

182
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:06,760
a university party,
and I wasn't in the best mood.

183
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:11,240
I've always had a certain proclivity 
towards depression,

184
00:11:11,241 --> 00:11:16,241
which I've recently discovered is 
probably an autoimmune problem in any 

185
00:11:16,701 --> 00:11:17,830
case.
Um,

186
00:11:18,270 --> 00:11:21,770
I'd gone to this party and I'd had a lot
to drink because I like to drink.

187
00:11:22,220 --> 00:11:23,210
And um,

188
00:11:25,990 --> 00:11:30,990
I didn't know,
I wasn't happy with something that 

189
00:11:30,990 --> 00:11:30,990
happened at the party,
wasn't happy with the way I behave.

190
00:11:30,990 --> 00:11:31,780
I mean,
that's not uncommon,

191
00:11:31,781 --> 00:11:32,230
right?
If you,

192
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:35,190
if like to drink then you're not happy 
with the way he behaved.

193
00:11:35,191 --> 00:11:37,510
Those things just go together.
And so,

194
00:11:37,511 --> 00:11:39,280
but there was,
it was deeper than that.

195
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:42,190
It wasn't just that I was unhappy with 
the way the party had gone,

196
00:11:42,191 --> 00:11:46,300
but I was deeply dissatisfied with how I
was oriented in life.

197
00:11:46,330 --> 00:11:49,120
Like I felt that I felt that there was 
a,

198
00:11:49,290 --> 00:11:52,400
it was a nihilism,
I suppose that was,

199
00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:57,420
that was gnawing at me and this was not 
long after I'd stopped.

200
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:03,130
I'd worked for Socialist Party in Canada
for a while when I was a kid.

201
00:12:03,131 --> 00:12:05,080
And this wasn't long after I stopped 
doing that.

202
00:12:05,081 --> 00:12:07,930
And so I kind of lost my moorings and 
um,

203
00:12:08,770 --> 00:12:13,770
you know,
the Christianity that my mother 

204
00:12:13,770 --> 00:12:14,740
practiced in particular,
I had abandon that when I was like 13.

205
00:12:14,740 --> 00:12:19,120
And so I didn't have any structured 
orient me at all.

206
00:12:19,180 --> 00:12:24,180
And so I was experimenting a little bit 
with artistic production at this point.

207
00:12:24,971 --> 00:12:25,870
Not a lot,
but a bit.

208
00:12:25,871 --> 00:12:30,871
And so I took out this canvas from my,
my closet and I sat down and I sketched 

209
00:12:33,281 --> 00:12:37,420
out this picture and I just let my 
imagination roam.

210
00:12:37,690 --> 00:12:40,500
And what came out was,
it was a crucifixion and there was a,

211
00:12:40,810 --> 00:12:44,260
I drew a picture of Christ on the,
on the crucifixion,

212
00:12:44,390 --> 00:12:48,850
but with a very judgemental face,
very angry face,

213
00:12:49,060 --> 00:12:51,370
and with a snake wrapped around his 
waist.

214
00:12:51,790 --> 00:12:55,290
And it was really harsh picture.
It was like an expressionist picture.

215
00:12:55,410 --> 00:12:57,460
And not that I have the talent of an 
expressionist,

216
00:12:57,461 --> 00:12:58,180
but,
but,

217
00:12:58,210 --> 00:12:59,770
but that's what it was.
And I thought,

218
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:01,260
I mean,
I,

219
00:13:01,450 --> 00:13:06,450
I wasn't thinking,
I didn't think that I was thinking in 

220
00:13:06,450 --> 00:13:07,390
religious terms at that point at all.

221
00:13:07,390 --> 00:13:12,390
And you know,
I was an absolutely sporadic church 

222
00:13:12,390 --> 00:13:12,390
goer.
And,

223
00:13:12,390 --> 00:13:16,260
and uh,
I was absolutely shocked by this 

224
00:13:16,260 --> 00:13:16,260
picture.
I thought,

225
00:13:16,260 --> 00:13:16,260
what,
what,

226
00:13:16,260 --> 00:13:19,980
where the hell did this come from?
What did that possibly me,

227
00:13:20,430 --> 00:13:22,080
you know,
I,

228
00:13:22,230 --> 00:13:24,040
it took me years to figure out what it 
meant.

229
00:13:24,130 --> 00:13:26,350
I mean,
really good one,

230
00:13:26,380 --> 00:13:28,660
one thing.
So I'll tell you part of what it meant.

231
00:13:29,050 --> 00:13:34,050
So Carl Jung said something very 
interesting about the structure of the 

232
00:13:34,050 --> 00:13:35,860
New Testament.
He said that the Gospel,

233
00:13:35,861 --> 00:13:40,861
Christ is fundamentally,
although not entirely fundamentally a 

234
00:13:40,861 --> 00:13:45,091
figure of compassion,
but the ideal is not only compassion,

235
00:13:46,990 --> 00:13:51,040
the ideal is also a judge because an 
ideal is a judge.

236
00:13:51,220 --> 00:13:54,500
You know,
let's say you have an ideal law,

237
00:13:54,630 --> 00:13:56,530
it's a judge because you don't live up 
to it,

238
00:13:56,531 --> 00:14:00,130
and so your ideal is always looking at 
you like you're not what you should be.

239
00:14:00,131 --> 00:14:03,610
And the higher the ideal,
the more judgmental the judge.

240
00:14:03,910 --> 00:14:08,910
Well,
that's why he thought the book of 

241
00:14:08,910 --> 00:14:09,280
revelation first of all emerged in the 
as an unconscious revelation,

242
00:14:09,740 --> 00:14:13,820
which because Christ comes back at the 
end of time,

243
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:18,880
so,
so the story goes as the ultimate judge 

244
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:22,120
and virtually no one is judged 
acceptable while why?

245
00:14:22,790 --> 00:14:27,790
Well,
because by the highest possible see 

246
00:14:27,790 --> 00:14:28,760
speaking psychologically,
you can biologically for that matter,

247
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:34,110
the idea of Christ is the instantiation 
of the ideal.

248
00:14:34,111 --> 00:14:36,660
As such,
that's what it is.

249
00:14:36,690 --> 00:14:38,340
Now,
it might be more than that,

250
00:14:38,370 --> 00:14:39,380
but that's what it is.
It's,

251
00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:44,560
it's whatever a human being would be.
If a human being was perfect and it's an

252
00:14:44,820 --> 00:14:49,350
effort of our collective imagination to 
represent that symbolically,

253
00:14:49,351 --> 00:14:51,180
which we do with cathedrals,
for example,

254
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:55,490
we paint the image of Christ against the
dome that represents eternity itself.

255
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:57,620
That's the ideal.
Now you might say,

256
00:14:57,621 --> 00:14:59,450
well,
I don't believe in the ideal.

257
00:14:59,451 --> 00:15:02,900
It's like you're missing the point.

258
00:15:03,350 --> 00:15:08,350
You're missing the point and so so that 
ideal is a judge and the farther you are

259
00:15:08,931 --> 00:15:11,300
away from that ideal,
the harsher the judge,

260
00:15:11,450 --> 00:15:16,450
and so the snake was part of that 
because the thing is is that if you're 

261
00:15:16,450 --> 00:15:20,300
low enough and the ideal is high enough,
the ideal itself is so judgmental and so

262
00:15:20,301 --> 00:15:23,270
detached for you that it starts to look 
to you like your enemy.

263
00:15:24,290 --> 00:15:26,720
And so that was the painting and it was 
like,

264
00:15:26,870 --> 00:15:30,020
and I was asking a question.
That was the thing that I was asking the

265
00:15:30,021 --> 00:15:35,021
question.
I was asking like what would I have to 

266
00:15:35,021 --> 00:15:37,721
do to set this?
What would I have to do to set the 

267
00:15:37,721 --> 00:15:38,180
situation that I'm in?
Right?

268
00:15:38,630 --> 00:15:40,430
And so then I drew this picture and the 
picture.

269
00:15:40,431 --> 00:15:44,840
How had the had the answer?
I mean,

270
00:15:45,230 --> 00:15:47,420
artistic production always has the 
answer.

271
00:15:47,421 --> 00:15:49,160
That's where the answers come from,
you know,

272
00:15:49,161 --> 00:15:51,620
and so that was a manifestation of 
imagination.

273
00:15:51,620 --> 00:15:56,620
It was,
it was part of me attempting in its 

274
00:15:56,620 --> 00:16:00,050
symbolic mode of personified thinking to
deliver a message.

275
00:16:00,410 --> 00:16:05,410
And so I swore that night that I was 
going to do whatever it took to set 

276
00:16:05,991 --> 00:16:06,680
myself,
right,

277
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:08,960
period,
whatever.

278
00:16:09,020 --> 00:16:12,590
And I was dead serious about that.
And so that was the,

279
00:16:12,890 --> 00:16:17,890
that was the moment.
And then I don't know what I did with 

280
00:16:17,890 --> 00:16:17,890
that picture.
I,

281
00:16:17,890 --> 00:16:19,060
I hid it in my closet because I was so 
freaked out by it.

282
00:16:19,061 --> 00:16:20,570
I thought,
what the Hell is this?

283
00:16:20,571 --> 00:16:25,571
It's like some schizophrenia nightmare.
It's like underneath the covers with 

284
00:16:25,571 --> 00:16:26,840
that thing.
But that was the,

285
00:16:27,270 --> 00:16:28,150
that.
And that was,

286
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:33,160
it wasn't long after that that I wrote 
the first essay that eventually turned 

287
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:35,870
into this maps of meaning book.
It was a poem to begin with actually,

288
00:16:35,871 --> 00:16:40,871
that that was how it came about first.
So that's when I decided to be,

289
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:46,840
to straighten myself out regardless of,
to straighten myself out.

290
00:16:47,510 --> 00:16:49,250
That's what I was going to do.
So,

291
00:16:51,100 --> 00:16:54,340
so I think this is our 13th show in 
Europe.

292
00:16:54,341 --> 00:16:59,341
We've got a couple more over the next 
couple of days and now it sounds like 

293
00:16:59,341 --> 00:16:59,470
we're extending for another 30 or 40 
probably in the spring.

294
00:16:59,471 --> 00:17:04,090
I mean this thing has just grown and 
grown and grown a.

295
00:17:04,420 --> 00:17:09,420
are you shocked at the amount of people 
that live in western societies here in 

296
00:17:09,701 --> 00:17:14,701
Norway?
Especially when we were in Sweden a 

297
00:17:14,701 --> 00:17:14,701
couple of days ago,
but all the countries that we've been in

298
00:17:14,701 --> 00:17:18,910
that live in free societies yet art 
completely afraid to say what they think

299
00:17:20,450 --> 00:17:22,120
is absolutely shocking.

300
00:17:22,120 --> 00:17:25,040
Thank you.
I think the most.

301
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:30,280
I think what I've been most shocked 
about in all of that is what's happened 

302
00:17:30,280 --> 00:17:34,751
in the UK with the police starting to 
prosecute people for crimes of 

303
00:17:35,030 --> 00:17:37,390
offensiveness.
That's just.

304
00:17:37,820 --> 00:17:40,520
And I think that's probably partly 
because I'm an.

305
00:17:40,521 --> 00:17:42,590
I mean,
I see that as broadly reflective of,

306
00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:44,840
of something that's happening in the 
West in general,

307
00:17:44,870 --> 00:17:48,050
but it's particularly shocking and 
appalling to me as a,

308
00:17:48,230 --> 00:17:53,230
as a western know because obviously 
counted that was part of the British 

309
00:17:53,230 --> 00:17:57,891
empire and when I grew up,
like there was a pretty tight affinity 

310
00:17:57,891 --> 00:17:59,430
still in western Canada with the British
empire.

311
00:17:59,431 --> 00:18:04,431
I mean our,
our maps where the dominion of Canada 

312
00:18:04,431 --> 00:18:04,431
was still pink,
you know,

313
00:18:04,431 --> 00:18:08,550
it was still part of the British empire.
We Sang God save the Queen Constantly at

314
00:18:08,580 --> 00:18:10,710
public gatherings.
That's gone by the wayside.

315
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:13,980
And so,
and you know,

316
00:18:15,210 --> 00:18:20,210
I've always regarded British common law 
and the British parliamentary tradition 

317
00:18:20,521 --> 00:18:25,521
as well.
One of it perhaps the highest 

318
00:18:25,521 --> 00:18:26,730
achievement of western civilization.
I mean,

319
00:18:26,731 --> 00:18:28,180
you could argue about that,
but it's,

320
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:30,180
it's in the top 10,
let's say.

321
00:18:30,750 --> 00:18:35,460
And then to see the Brits who also have 
this phenomenal sense of humor,

322
00:18:35,461 --> 00:18:40,461
this ability to say anything,
no matter how outrageous about anyone 

323
00:18:40,461 --> 00:18:42,840
and to include themselves in the joke,
right?

324
00:18:42,841 --> 00:18:47,841
Which is such an elegant way of 
expressing comedic freedom to see them 

325
00:18:49,201 --> 00:18:52,080
going down this road is just,
it just,

326
00:18:52,350 --> 00:18:53,310
it's,
it's,

327
00:18:53,790 --> 00:18:57,900
it's what is it exactly.
While it's deeply saddening,

328
00:18:58,290 --> 00:18:59,730
that's for sure.
And,

329
00:19:00,410 --> 00:19:00,890
and

330
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:04,890
what's horrifying and it's not exactly 
the right word.

331
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:08,250
I don't know what the word for it is 
there certainly sorrow that's associated

332
00:19:08,251 --> 00:19:09,770
with a disbelief.
It's also

333
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:11,510
at,
at,

334
00:19:12,290 --> 00:19:17,290
at watching that happen in what I still 
think is the central core of the idea of

335
00:19:18,170 --> 00:19:22,910
individual sovereignty and freedom as 
expressed across the western world.

336
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:28,360
And so,
and then there's similar manifestations 

337
00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:31,691
of that everywhere else,
but the police per prosecuting people 

338
00:19:31,691 --> 00:19:34,220
for you know,
asking people to turn in their neighbors

339
00:19:34,221 --> 00:19:37,970
if they say something offensive.
And that's happening in the UK.

340
00:19:38,090 --> 00:19:39,490
Yeah.
Literally what we saw that,

341
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:44,500
that somebody sent me posters,
pictures of posters in the Scottish 

342
00:19:46,470 --> 00:19:47,450
subway,
in the metro,

343
00:19:47,451 --> 00:19:48,710
in the tube,
you know,

344
00:19:48,711 --> 00:19:53,711
saying inviting people to inform on 
their neighbors for being offensive.

345
00:19:53,751 --> 00:19:56,110
It's like what the hell,
what,

346
00:19:56,111 --> 00:19:58,130
what?
So I knew this was coming because.

347
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:03,880
Because I knew we brought our first hate
speech laws in Canada back in the 19 

348
00:20:06,141 --> 00:20:09,110
eighties.
We were after this character named Ernst

349
00:20:09,110 --> 00:20:14,110
Zandel,
who is a particularly despicable piece 

350
00:20:14,110 --> 00:20:15,080
of work,
hard hat wearing right wing antisemitism

351
00:20:15,320 --> 00:20:16,880
Holocaust denier,
you know,

352
00:20:16,881 --> 00:20:19,510
he had it all that guy,
um,

353
00:20:20,060 --> 00:20:25,060
and you know,
it was his shenanigans,

354
00:20:27,380 --> 00:20:32,380
careless malevolent shenanigans that 
entice Canadians into producing hate 

355
00:20:32,841 --> 00:20:34,340
speech legislation.
I thought,

356
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:35,730
no,
that's,

357
00:20:35,930 --> 00:20:38,450
that's not good.
It's not good.

358
00:20:38,990 --> 00:20:41,390
You're making a big mistake.
We're going to pay for this.

359
00:20:41,391 --> 00:20:43,160
It's going to unfold over a long time.

360
00:20:44,670 --> 00:20:45,990
Who defines hate

361
00:20:47,810 --> 00:20:48,350
the crucial

362
00:20:48,350 --> 00:20:50,870
issue.
It's not like it's a scientific category

363
00:20:51,320 --> 00:20:56,320
to judgment.
And the answer is those whom you least 

364
00:20:56,320 --> 00:21:00,791
want to have the power to define it 
because they're the ones that will take 

365
00:21:00,791 --> 00:21:02,480
that power to themselves.
And if you think that isn't gonna Affect

366
00:21:02,481 --> 00:21:05,210
what you get to say,
well you've got another thing coming.

367
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:10,680
So I think it's,
I think it's going to pay for it and 

368
00:21:13,630 --> 00:21:18,630
hopefully,
hopefully we'll wake up and push back 

369
00:21:18,630 --> 00:21:20,650
before we have to pay too high a price.
We're going to pay for it.

370
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:25,180
So yeah,
and we're going to deserve to pay for it

371
00:21:25,181 --> 00:21:29,200
too.
He's talking to you

372
00:21:36,490 --> 00:21:38,680
last night,
last night

373
00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:41,510
it was on this British show called 
question time,

374
00:21:41,511 --> 00:21:44,300
which is very famous British show and 
there was a,

375
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:46,610
um,
a woman parliamentarian.

376
00:21:46,611 --> 00:21:48,470
They're from Ireland who was pretty 
bright.

377
00:21:48,860 --> 00:21:53,860
I liked listening to her,
but I'm the host asked me about this 

378
00:21:54,411 --> 00:21:55,780
character named count.
Dang,

379
00:21:55,790 --> 00:21:57,620
Kyla,
I don't know if you know about him.

380
00:21:58,160 --> 00:22:01,520
I'm his girlfriend.
He's a comedian.

381
00:22:01,580 --> 00:22:03,470
Well,
he thinks he's a comedian and.

382
00:22:03,710 --> 00:22:05,330
Well,
but you know,

383
00:22:06,260 --> 00:22:11,260
there are lots of Comedians who think 
they're comedians that aren't funny and 

384
00:22:11,260 --> 00:22:14,900
I'm not saying he's not funny because 
other people think that he's a comedian 

385
00:22:14,900 --> 00:22:15,140
too.
But he presents himself as a comedian.

386
00:22:15,290 --> 00:22:18,530
Count Danky law.
I mean that's actually a joke,

387
00:22:18,531 --> 00:22:23,531
that name and his girlfriend had a pug 
and I liked count danky him because he 

388
00:22:24,501 --> 00:22:28,130
hated that pug and I'm not very fond of 
pugs.

389
00:22:28,131 --> 00:22:30,710
I think they're hideous little creatures
and,

390
00:22:30,910 --> 00:22:31,940
and,
and,

391
00:22:32,610 --> 00:22:37,610
and you know,
I don't really hate them if a bug comes 

392
00:22:37,610 --> 00:22:37,860
along then all pet it and everything,
but

393
00:22:38,140 --> 00:22:39,710
it's just sort of like the,
the,

394
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:42,350
this little rat like dog with these 
bugs.

395
00:22:42,890 --> 00:22:47,890
If you hit it on the back of the head,
the eyes will pop out and so because 

396
00:22:48,641 --> 00:22:52,120
they've been so genetically mishandled 
and so,

397
00:22:52,630 --> 00:22:53,380
I don't know,
man.

398
00:22:53,381 --> 00:22:58,381
It's just,
you do realize we're putting this on 

399
00:22:58,381 --> 00:23:00,781
youtube and you're just done.
You're unleashing a whole new world to 

400
00:23:00,781 --> 00:23:01,630
hate to bug people.
I know,

401
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:02,410
I know.
I know,

402
00:23:02,470 --> 00:23:03,190
but whatever,

403
00:23:03,190 --> 00:23:04,770
whatever.
So you can have your plugin,

404
00:23:04,780 --> 00:23:09,780
you can love it.
My Dad had this dog that was so damn 

405
00:23:09,780 --> 00:23:11,440
hideous and useless that it was just a 
miracle and he loved it to death and so,

406
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:12,850
and you know,
that's fine,

407
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:13,690
that's fine,
but.

408
00:23:14,150 --> 00:23:19,150
And there's kind of an ironic attitude 
in the dismissal of pugs and Daniella 

409
00:23:19,150 --> 00:23:23,910
didn't like his girlfriend's pug and so 
he thought he'd play a mean trick or a 

410
00:23:23,910 --> 00:23:27,460
mean slash funny trick and teach it to 
do a hail Hitler salute.

411
00:23:27,970 --> 00:23:30,640
I actually thought it was quite funny.
It's like I don't,

412
00:23:30,850 --> 00:23:35,850
look,
I don't see that as glorifying Hitler 

413
00:23:35,850 --> 00:23:37,030
hits up Pug for God's sake.
It wasn't,

414
00:23:37,031 --> 00:23:38,410
uh,
it wasn't a,

415
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:41,230
what do you call those Doberman,
you know,

416
00:23:41,290 --> 00:23:46,290
it was a pub.
It's like teaching a rat to do a hail 

417
00:23:46,290 --> 00:23:50,501
Hitler salute.
I love that this has come down to the 

418
00:23:50,501 --> 00:23:52,100
breed of dogs with you.
These things matter in terms of,

419
00:23:52,610 --> 00:23:54,470
I love the way they're represented,
you know,

420
00:23:54,471 --> 00:23:55,820
and then,
you know,

421
00:23:55,910 --> 00:23:57,370
he,
he taught it to,

422
00:23:58,040 --> 00:24:02,480
it's so horrible.
He and I'm gonna be so killed for this.

423
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:07,790
He taught it to do it's little salute 
when he said gas the Jews,

424
00:24:07,791 --> 00:24:09,370
which is not funny,
you know,

425
00:24:09,770 --> 00:24:11,630
except it's horribly funny,

426
00:24:11,670 --> 00:24:12,570
you know,
that's the thing.

427
00:24:12,840 --> 00:24:14,280
Well look,
and so yeah,

428
00:24:14,281 --> 00:24:15,510
you laugh.
That's right.

429
00:24:15,511 --> 00:24:17,430
Because you're all horrible and you 
know,

430
00:24:18,300 --> 00:24:23,300
and you know perfectly well that it's 
horribly funny and you know,

431
00:24:29,011 --> 00:24:30,470
we need,
we need

432
00:24:30,510 --> 00:24:34,440
to be able to be horribly funny because 
life is horrible and we.

433
00:24:34,441 --> 00:24:39,441
And we need to be able to find.
We need to be able to allow people the 

434
00:24:39,661 --> 00:24:44,661
freedom to find the ability to transcend
that horror with comedy and a mark of a 

435
00:24:46,141 --> 00:24:50,940
free society is that con comedians can 
be just exactly what the R is,

436
00:24:50,950 --> 00:24:53,970
which there are people who push the edge
of what's acceptable.

437
00:24:54,120 --> 00:24:56,970
If you're a brilliant comedian,
you get right to the edge,

438
00:24:56,971 --> 00:24:58,230
right?
New dance there.

439
00:24:58,380 --> 00:25:01,560
And the audience is thinking,
Sarah Silvermans a good example of that.

440
00:25:01,561 --> 00:25:02,910
You know,
because you can just see her.

441
00:25:03,060 --> 00:25:04,830
She's gone all politically correct 
recently,

442
00:25:04,831 --> 00:25:07,290
but when she was in her heyday,
you could just see Sarah,

443
00:25:07,291 --> 00:25:09,720
she's so smart.
You'd see you're sitting there and she'd

444
00:25:09,721 --> 00:25:14,160
think of something just spectacularly 
evil and horrible.

445
00:25:14,430 --> 00:25:16,560
And she think,
oh,

446
00:25:17,070 --> 00:25:18,210
and then she say it,
you know,

447
00:25:18,211 --> 00:25:23,211
and everyone would just crack up because
like the darkest part of their soul had 

448
00:25:23,211 --> 00:25:25,650
once thought something like that.
And she dared to Audi read 10.

449
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:28,950
And by honoring it she also 
simultaneously transcended it,

450
00:25:28,951 --> 00:25:31,190
you know?
And that's the beauty of comedy and,

451
00:25:31,570 --> 00:25:33,090
and,
and well.

452
00:25:33,091 --> 00:25:33,890
So anyways,
they,

453
00:25:33,891 --> 00:25:36,510
they went after,
Dang Kyla and nailed him legally.

454
00:25:36,511 --> 00:25:39,110
And I thought that's an that's in Great 
Britain as well.

455
00:25:39,111 --> 00:25:44,111
And last night,
so they brought this up one on question 

456
00:25:44,111 --> 00:25:47,661
time and you know the,
the Irish woman who said she went off on

457
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:51,480
a talk about how terrible Kristallnacht 
wasn't,

458
00:25:51,540 --> 00:25:54,960
what an awful thing Auschwitz and the 
Holocaust was.

459
00:25:54,961 --> 00:25:56,370
It's like,
well,

460
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:08,350
you're not that morally virtuous to 
notice that know.

461
00:26:08,360 --> 00:26:09,480
You know what I mean?
It's like.

462
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:12,000
And it didn't have anything to do with 
the topic at hand.

463
00:26:12,001 --> 00:26:17,001
It's like,
yet you wouldn't say that you noticed 

464
00:26:17,001 --> 00:26:19,911
that unless you were implying that there
are people around you including this 

465
00:26:19,911 --> 00:26:19,911
count.
Dang,

466
00:26:19,911 --> 00:26:21,600
can I.
Who didn't notice that?

467
00:26:22,560 --> 00:26:27,560
Okay.
It had nothing to do with whether he 

468
00:26:27,560 --> 00:26:27,560
should have been prosecuted for his 
stupid joke.

469
00:26:27,560 --> 00:26:29,040
And then you can say,
well,

470
00:26:29,041 --> 00:26:31,470
you could say it was a stupid joke,
which it certainly was.

471
00:26:31,740 --> 00:26:34,080
You could say that it was a hateful 
joke,

472
00:26:34,081 --> 00:26:36,840
which I don't agree with by the way.
But you could say that.

473
00:26:36,841 --> 00:26:39,990
And I think you could.
You could make a credible case for that.

474
00:26:40,260 --> 00:26:43,800
But then to say that because you think 
that the Holocaust bad,

475
00:26:43,830 --> 00:26:46,110
he should be criminally prosecuted.
It's like,

476
00:26:46,170 --> 00:26:47,370
nope,
sorry man,

477
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:50,790
you've crossed the line and there's no 
excuse for it.

478
00:26:51,300 --> 00:26:56,300
And so that's part of what's worrisome 
about the state of discourse in the free

479
00:26:58,111 --> 00:27:00,150
West.
That same thing,

480
00:27:00,180 --> 00:27:02,280
comedians won't go to university 
campuses,

481
00:27:02,940 --> 00:27:04,740
same thing.
You don't get to be funny.

482
00:27:05,340 --> 00:27:08,310
So if you can't be funny than you're not
free,

483
00:27:09,420 --> 00:27:11,730
you know the gesture and the king's 
courts,

484
00:27:11,731 --> 00:27:13,530
the only person who gets to tell the 
truth.

485
00:27:13,830 --> 00:27:16,380
And if the king is such a tyrant that he
kills his gesture,

486
00:27:16,381 --> 00:27:19,050
then you know that the evil king is in 
charge.

487
00:27:19,470 --> 00:27:21,570
And so when we can't tolerate our 
comedians,

488
00:27:21,571 --> 00:27:22,200
it's like,
well,

489
00:27:22,201 --> 00:27:24,240
there you go.
They're the canaries in the coal mine as

490
00:27:24,241 --> 00:27:25,140
far as I'm concerned.

491
00:27:26,420 --> 00:27:31,420
Thank you.

492
00:27:40,110 --> 00:27:45,110
My wife that I wouldn't hit any hornets 
with any Hornet's nest with sticks for 

493
00:27:45,601 --> 00:27:50,601
like a day.
And now I just hit a big hornet's nest 

494
00:27:50,601 --> 00:27:50,601
with this.

495
00:27:50,601 --> 00:27:52,290
So sorry Tammy.
She's here somewhere.

496
00:27:52,410 --> 00:27:53,910
Yeah,
give it up for Jordan's wife,

497
00:27:53,911 --> 00:27:55,650
by the way.
She's been on this entire time.

498
00:27:56,270 --> 00:28:01,270
Thank you.

499
00:28:05,670 --> 00:28:07,490
All right,
so let's at David's fault.

500
00:28:07,540 --> 00:28:08,600
Yeah,
let,

501
00:28:09,030 --> 00:28:12,800
let's shift gears a little bit.
What has been the best part

502
00:28:12,930 --> 00:28:16,200
of this adventure of this tour for you 
personally?

503
00:28:18,680 --> 00:28:19,610
Oh,
well,

504
00:28:20,060 --> 00:28:25,060
the best part happens all the time.
The best part I think.

505
00:28:26,120 --> 00:28:28,730
I think I told this story tonight 
though.

506
00:28:28,731 --> 00:28:30,900
I'm not sure because I talked to a bunch
of journalists today,

507
00:28:30,901 --> 00:28:32,360
so can't remember when I told this 
story,

508
00:28:32,361 --> 00:28:36,590
but this guy came up to me last night.
He was kind of a pierced guy,

509
00:28:36,620 --> 00:28:40,850
rough looking guy and uh,
but he's probably in his late twenties,

510
00:28:41,090 --> 00:28:43,090
maybe early thirties.
He said,

511
00:28:43,100 --> 00:28:43,470
uh,

512
00:28:45,580 --> 00:28:45,880
I've,

513
00:28:46,510 --> 00:28:48,670
I've been smoking drug free for nine 
months.

514
00:28:49,810 --> 00:28:50,620
And I said,
hey,

515
00:28:50,621 --> 00:28:55,621
good work man.
Because he looked pretty pleased about 

516
00:28:55,621 --> 00:28:55,621
that.
I said,

517
00:28:55,621 --> 00:28:55,621
well,
you know,

518
00:28:55,621 --> 00:28:58,180
hopefully that's a lot better.
And he said it's a lot better.

519
00:28:58,690 --> 00:28:59,230
And I said,
well,

520
00:28:59,231 --> 00:29:01,750
good for you for sticking it out and I 
hope you can continue it.

521
00:29:01,751 --> 00:29:06,751
And I meant that because I didn't mean 
good for you and hope you can stick it 

522
00:29:06,751 --> 00:29:10,231
out.
And he knew I meant that because he 

523
00:29:10,231 --> 00:29:10,231
wouldn't have bloody well told me that 
to begin with,

524
00:29:10,231 --> 00:29:11,260
he didn't think that that was going to 
be the response.

525
00:29:11,620 --> 00:29:16,620
And then he said,
I got nine of my mates to do the same 

526
00:29:16,620 --> 00:29:16,620
thing.
Yeah.

527
00:29:16,620 --> 00:29:18,040
I thought right on,
man,

528
00:29:18,041 --> 00:29:19,560
that's great.
And then you know,

529
00:29:19,561 --> 00:29:21,910
this.
I was in Birmingham two nights ago and I

530
00:29:21,911 --> 00:29:25,720
walked out of the hotel and this kid 
working class kid came up to me,

531
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:27,070
you know,
just out of the blue.

532
00:29:27,070 --> 00:29:32,070
And he said,
thank you very much for elevating my 

533
00:29:32,070 --> 00:29:32,070
vision.
I thought,

534
00:29:32,070 --> 00:29:35,731
hey look,
it's really good thing to be able to go 

535
00:29:35,731 --> 00:29:38,551
around the world and to have people stop
you on the street and say things like 

536
00:29:38,551 --> 00:29:38,860
that to you.
It's like that's as good as it gets.

537
00:29:38,861 --> 00:29:43,861
You know?
And people are telling me stories like 

538
00:29:43,861 --> 00:29:44,140
all the time they come up and they say,
well you've watched this thing.

539
00:29:44,170 --> 00:29:49,170
It happens all the time.
People come up and they tell me some way

540
00:29:49,301 --> 00:29:51,220
that their house was out of order,
you know,

541
00:29:51,221 --> 00:29:56,221
they are hopeless and,
and nihilistic and drinking too much and

542
00:29:56,590 --> 00:30:01,590
watching too much pornography and 
procrastinating too much and being not 

543
00:30:01,590 --> 00:30:04,440
serious with the relationship and not 
getting along with their parents and you

544
00:30:04,441 --> 00:30:06,730
know,
not formulating a vision and not growing

545
00:30:06,731 --> 00:30:08,090
up and,
you know,

546
00:30:08,110 --> 00:30:11,800
there's just endless ways that you can 
descend into a kind of,

547
00:30:12,430 --> 00:30:15,190
what would you call it,
a kind of Grungy,

548
00:30:16,270 --> 00:30:21,270
filthy carpet infested hell and,
and so,

549
00:30:22,230 --> 00:30:23,470
and then they say,
look,

550
00:30:23,471 --> 00:30:28,471
I've been watching your lectures and 
I've developed a plan for my life and 

551
00:30:28,600 --> 00:30:33,600
I've been trying to be more responsible 
and I've been really turned to tell the 

552
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:33,600
truth.

553
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:37,290
And I mended my relationship with my 
father and I got married to my 

554
00:30:37,290 --> 00:30:40,951
girlfriend and now I have a flat and I 
quit doing drugs and I've just tripled 

555
00:30:40,951 --> 00:30:43,000
my salary in the last year.
And um,

556
00:30:43,420 --> 00:30:47,380
and I didn't commit suicide like I was 
going to six months ago.

557
00:30:47,381 --> 00:30:49,150
I think I have,
I don't know,

558
00:30:49,330 --> 00:30:52,090
out of 150 people that I talked to each 
night,

559
00:30:52,091 --> 00:30:55,990
I would say probably over the course of 
the lecture series,

560
00:30:55,991 --> 00:31:00,991
there's probably 10 people like that and
night who tell me that and so see,

561
00:31:01,240 --> 00:31:06,240
because I believe what I said tonight,
I believe that the individual is 

562
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:10,891
sovereign and that individual 
sovereignty is the cornerstone of 

563
00:31:11,140 --> 00:31:16,060
reality itself and it's the cornerstone 
of the state and it's the cornerstone of

564
00:31:16,061 --> 00:31:19,060
reality itself.
I truly believe that to be the case,

565
00:31:19,660 --> 00:31:22,360
that every time I hear someone say,
look,

566
00:31:22,361 --> 00:31:23,560
I've got my act together.

567
00:31:23,560 --> 00:31:28,560
I think that's one more weight on.
You know,

568
00:31:28,561 --> 00:31:31,930
if the scales are always tilting towards
good or towards evil,

569
00:31:31,931 --> 00:31:34,870
then every time someone decides to 
straighten themselves up,

570
00:31:34,871 --> 00:31:39,871
they put a mate.
They take a major weight off the evil 

571
00:31:39,871 --> 00:31:42,751
side and they put it on the good side 
and it's not trivial and I believe that 

572
00:31:42,751 --> 00:31:44,140
that's what the redemption of the world 
depends on.

573
00:31:44,380 --> 00:31:49,380
It's not political.
It happens at the level of the 

574
00:31:49,380 --> 00:31:52,081
individual.
Just like the descent into totalitarian 

575
00:31:52,081 --> 00:31:54,370
catastrophe occurs when people abandon 
their sovereign responsibility,

576
00:31:54,460 --> 00:31:59,460
which I think is the most accurate way 
of diagnosing what happened in the 20th 

577
00:31:59,460 --> 00:32:03,121
century.
So whenever someone comes up to me and 

578
00:32:03,121 --> 00:32:03,121
says,
I was not doing so well,

579
00:32:03,121 --> 00:32:06,430
and here's three ways where I've really 
put my life together,

580
00:32:06,580 --> 00:32:10,270
we have a little 15 second party and we 
both know why,

581
00:32:10,420 --> 00:32:13,330
and so that's,
that's as good as it gets.

582
00:32:13,390 --> 00:32:18,390
And so that's happening constantly and I
feel generally speaking that these 

583
00:32:18,390 --> 00:32:21,700
events are like their celebrations of 
that and so interesting to watch.

584
00:32:21,701 --> 00:32:26,701
The media missed this completely.
It's like they don't have the 

585
00:32:26,701 --> 00:32:29,170
conceptual.
What would you say?

586
00:32:30,210 --> 00:32:35,210
They don't have the conceptual tools to 
understand that something might be 

587
00:32:36,521 --> 00:32:41,521
happening that's worthy of note outside 
the purely conventional confines of,

588
00:32:42,920 --> 00:32:47,750
of you know that the stultifying and dol
political discourse,

589
00:32:48,020 --> 00:32:51,470
but it doesn't matter.
It might be nice if it didn't happen.

590
00:32:51,471 --> 00:32:55,610
It doesn't fundamentally mattered 
because I'm a psychologist.

591
00:32:56,120 --> 00:33:01,120
I decided a long time ago that the 
individual was the right level of 

592
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:02,600
analysis and so it's an absolute.

593
00:33:04,780 --> 00:33:06,670
It's,
it's not a pleasure.

594
00:33:06,671 --> 00:33:08,350
It's not the right way of thinking about
it.

595
00:33:11,920 --> 00:33:13,450
What's rule seven?
Do.

596
00:33:13,451 --> 00:33:15,310
What is meaningful?
Note what is expedient.

597
00:33:16,090 --> 00:33:20,200
This is the most deeply meaningful thing
that I can envision doing.

598
00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:23,320
So that's great.
It's great.

599
00:33:23,410 --> 00:33:28,410
It's hard.
Great is hard when something great 

600
00:33:28,410 --> 00:33:28,540
happens,
that's hard,

601
00:33:28,990 --> 00:33:29,650
right?
It's not a.

602
00:33:29,770 --> 00:33:34,770
it's not something trivial,
but it's doesn't matter because because 

603
00:33:34,770 --> 00:33:39,130
it's great and so every time someone 
says to me,

604
00:33:39,580 --> 00:33:42,610
I'm better.
I'm getting along with my father.

605
00:33:42,990 --> 00:33:45,630
I married my girlfriend.
We're going to have a child.

606
00:33:45,640 --> 00:33:47,860
We were going to have children.
Now we're going to have children.

607
00:33:48,220 --> 00:33:52,780
I think that's one more.
So that's great man.

608
00:33:56,180 --> 00:34:01,180
Thank you.

609
00:34:07,270 --> 00:34:10,330
Tell the audience a little bit about 
Jordan Peterson having fun.

610
00:34:10,390 --> 00:34:13,510
We did serious Jordan Peterson Peterson 
doing for fun.

611
00:34:19,200 --> 00:34:23,170
I stumped him actually.
It's not like I don't.

612
00:34:23,720 --> 00:34:28,720
It's like most of what I've always done 
for fun in my life has been to play,

613
00:34:30,270 --> 00:34:32,110
you know,
and so when I had little kids,

614
00:34:32,111 --> 00:34:37,111
I played with them all the time and my 
kids are grown up and I play with them 

615
00:34:37,111 --> 00:34:39,280
all the time and my daughter is so 
playful.

616
00:34:39,310 --> 00:34:43,750
Despite her rather catastrophic life up 
to this point,

617
00:34:44,110 --> 00:34:49,110
she's much better,
but is that every single thing she says 

618
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:52,430
when she's not delivering?
Oh,

619
00:34:53,240 --> 00:34:53,570
like,
uh,

620
00:34:54,070 --> 00:34:59,070
when she's not focused on talking to 
people about a serious topic,

621
00:34:59,710 --> 00:35:02,210
everything she says is a joke,
you know,

622
00:35:02,230 --> 00:35:06,700
when my son is ridiculously Tz and 
playful and so and so,

623
00:35:06,701 --> 00:35:08,890
that's fun.
And when they were little kids,

624
00:35:08,891 --> 00:35:13,891
we just played all the time.
And so I really liked that and most of 

625
00:35:13,891 --> 00:35:16,630
the people who've been my close friends 
have been people like that.

626
00:35:16,660 --> 00:35:21,660
They're there.
They play with their speech all the 

627
00:35:21,660 --> 00:35:24,241
time,
which is why I think I get along with 

628
00:35:24,241 --> 00:35:24,241
Comedians,
you know,

629
00:35:24,241 --> 00:35:24,241
it's like,
it's partly why we travel well together.

630
00:35:24,241 --> 00:35:26,350
And John Now my tour manager,
who's a great guy,

631
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:27,730
very,
very useful.

632
00:35:27,820 --> 00:35:32,820
He's also a comedian and Rogan's a 
comedian and so many of the people that 

633
00:35:32,820 --> 00:35:33,610
I got along with her comedians and,
and,

634
00:35:33,870 --> 00:35:38,870
and the best interviews on how to beat 
with comedians because there's that 

635
00:35:38,870 --> 00:35:41,220
element of play.
So I really like that on this tour.

636
00:35:42,210 --> 00:35:47,210
There's not a lot of fun.
I wouldn't say we had a good time when 

637
00:35:47,210 --> 00:35:48,460
we went to the comedy club in Salt Lake 
City,

638
00:35:48,520 --> 00:35:49,770
Salt Lake City.
That was,

639
00:35:49,771 --> 00:35:54,771
that was fun.
That was 45 minutes of fun and I had 

640
00:35:54,771 --> 00:35:54,900
some fun at Cambridge.
I had.

641
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:56,080
I had some fun in it.

642
00:35:56,300 --> 00:36:01,300
Just to be clear,
I brought Jordan up as the surprise 

643
00:36:01,300 --> 00:36:03,931
guest.
I did about our standup and then I 

644
00:36:03,931 --> 00:36:03,931
brought Jordan up and we did.
We sort of did stand up together.

645
00:36:03,931 --> 00:36:06,730
We just kind of riff for about 45 
minutes and people were.

646
00:36:06,830 --> 00:36:07,360
Yeah,
it was fun.

647
00:36:07,390 --> 00:36:09,100
They were thrilled and they love seeing 
you laugh.

648
00:36:10,150 --> 00:36:14,030
I was at the Cambridge Union just a 
couple of days ago and I was in a fairly

649
00:36:14,120 --> 00:36:17,660
high spirited mood and I had a fair bit 
of fun with the students there.

650
00:36:17,690 --> 00:36:21,880
It was still serious,
but you know what I really like what the

651
00:36:22,100 --> 00:36:27,100
times in my life that I've had the best 
time is when I'm sitting around with a 

652
00:36:27,100 --> 00:36:30,851
variety of people who are very amusing 
and all they're trying to do is to 

653
00:36:30,851 --> 00:36:34,100
outwit each other with something absurd 
and funny and it was really a part of,

654
00:36:34,430 --> 00:36:37,910
I don't know if it's a part of,
of Scandinavian culture or not,

655
00:36:37,911 --> 00:36:39,410
but in,
in,

656
00:36:39,490 --> 00:36:41,600
in,
in the West where I grew up,

657
00:36:42,030 --> 00:36:46,430
which is a working class culture.
I mean most of what my friends and I did

658
00:36:46,431 --> 00:36:51,431
with regards to conversation was like 
half winded up,

659
00:36:52,570 --> 00:36:54,060
up,
up,

660
00:36:54,170 --> 00:36:56,540
up men upmanship.
I guess that's what it is.

661
00:36:56,810 --> 00:37:00,230
Your goal was to say something funnier 
than the person just before you said.

662
00:37:00,470 --> 00:37:02,960
And so it was competitive humor and I 
really,

663
00:37:02,961 --> 00:37:07,961
really liked that a lot.
And so when I'm able that's great 

664
00:37:08,330 --> 00:37:10,960
relief,
but this tour,

665
00:37:10,961 --> 00:37:15,230
like it's very tightly scheduled,
crazily tightly scheduled.

666
00:37:15,231 --> 00:37:20,231
And tammy and I decided at the beginning
that because it was such an absurd 

667
00:37:20,231 --> 00:37:23,450
opportunity that it was a working tour,
you know,

668
00:37:23,451 --> 00:37:28,451
and that we were going to subordinate 
everything to making sure that these 

669
00:37:28,451 --> 00:37:32,261
shows went as well as they possibly 
could and that we would take whatever 

670
00:37:33,050 --> 00:37:35,340
refuge in amusement we could,
you know,

671
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:38,240
where we could steal it.
And we've had some of that.

672
00:37:38,510 --> 00:37:43,510
I mean the last time we were in Oslo,
we walked up to the sculpture gardens 

673
00:37:43,510 --> 00:37:47,021
and so that was really cool and we 
walked down the boulevard and we only 

674
00:37:47,021 --> 00:37:48,140
had about an hour and a half to take a 
look around the city,

675
00:37:48,300 --> 00:37:50,930
but it was a nice hour and a half,
you know,

676
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:53,270
the sun was out and we enjoyed 
ourselves.

677
00:37:53,271 --> 00:37:55,910
And so that's rule 12,
right?

678
00:37:55,970 --> 00:37:58,670
Pet a cat on the street when,
when you see one,

679
00:37:59,210 --> 00:38:04,210
when you encountered one and you take 
your joy where you can get it and you 

680
00:38:04,210 --> 00:38:07,730
don't complain if it's not happening 
perhaps as often as it should,

681
00:38:07,731 --> 00:38:12,731
especially when you're given like we 
have been this absolutely improbable 

682
00:38:14,900 --> 00:38:19,900
adventure and we'll have time.
Hopefully God willing,

683
00:38:20,600 --> 00:38:25,600
knock on wood with some luck for some 
more fun in the future.

684
00:38:30,940 --> 00:38:33,290
That's actually quite a segue to my next
question,

685
00:38:33,291 --> 00:38:38,291
which is because you about stories so 
much in the importance of stories.

686
00:38:39,850 --> 00:38:44,850
Does the Jordan Peterson story had a 
happy ending and does that even matter 

687
00:38:44,850 --> 00:38:47,830
or what do you think that the ending of 
the Jordan Peterson story is?

688
00:38:52,550 --> 00:38:53,810
Alright,
don't have any idea.

689
00:38:55,270 --> 00:38:56,540
Um,
you know,

690
00:38:56,960 --> 00:39:01,960
when I was from the time I was about 20,
I kind of had a sense of what would 

691
00:39:03,861 --> 00:39:06,950
happen to me.
I had some sense of it,

692
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:12,760
but only it really only extended until I
was about my age 50,

693
00:39:13,791 --> 00:39:17,060
something like that.
And I didn't know what would.

694
00:39:17,540 --> 00:39:19,700
I didn't have a vision for after that.

695
00:39:20,500 --> 00:39:20,950
And

696
00:39:23,820 --> 00:39:25,080
See,
I thought when I wrote,

697
00:39:25,110 --> 00:39:27,510
wrote maps of meaning,
I remember telling one of my,

698
00:39:28,530 --> 00:39:32,220
my peers,
I said,

699
00:39:32,221 --> 00:39:36,540
I think everyone will think the way that
I think in this book in 50 years.

700
00:39:37,260 --> 00:39:42,260
And he said,
well that's a pretty grandiose claim.

701
00:39:43,051 --> 00:39:45,120
I guess that that was it.
Something like,

702
00:39:45,121 --> 00:39:45,900
well,
fair enough,

703
00:39:45,901 --> 00:39:46,380
you know,
but,

704
00:39:46,710 --> 00:39:48,270
but,
but by the same token,

705
00:39:48,271 --> 00:39:51,840
I wasn't taking,
I wasn't taking credit for the ideas,

706
00:39:51,870 --> 00:39:56,570
like I was taking some credit for 
clarifying them.

707
00:39:57,440 --> 00:40:00,780
The ideas were already there.
They're everywhere.

708
00:40:00,781 --> 00:40:04,590
Those ideas,
but clarifying the miss something and so

709
00:40:04,591 --> 00:40:09,591
I knew that when I was working on in 
maps of meaning was at the center of 

710
00:40:09,591 --> 00:40:14,001
things in some sense and that manifested
itself in my teaching career because,

711
00:40:16,530 --> 00:40:21,530
well I taught at Harvard for six years 
and the course there which was based on 

712
00:40:21,530 --> 00:40:23,310
my book was very,
very popular and,

713
00:40:23,500 --> 00:40:28,500
and students regarding to this life 
changing in the same thing happened at 

714
00:40:28,500 --> 00:40:28,500
the University of Toronto.

715
00:40:28,500 --> 00:40:32,760
And so I knew that that power was in 
those ideas,

716
00:40:33,450 --> 00:40:38,450
but I don't see my future very clearly 
from here on,

717
00:40:39,991 --> 00:40:41,620
in,
you know,

718
00:40:42,090 --> 00:40:45,120
over the next year I'm going to do more 
of what I do it.

719
00:40:45,210 --> 00:40:48,540
I want to return to the exodus to exit 
this.

720
00:40:48,630 --> 00:40:52,080
I like doing those biblical lectures.
I thought that was useful and important.

721
00:40:52,860 --> 00:40:57,860
So I want to do that.
But my vision kinds of kind of runs out 

722
00:40:57,860 --> 00:41:00,950
in December of 2019 and I don't know 
what,

723
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:05,670
because all of this is so unlikely,
you know,

724
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:08,970
our thought for the last two years,
every single day I thought,

725
00:41:08,971 --> 00:41:12,270
well this is going to come to an end.
Like this is ridiculous.

726
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:17,130
This is ridiculous.
It's cad continued but it is continuing.

727
00:41:17,700 --> 00:41:21,720
And so I have no idea how.
How do you predict something like that?

728
00:41:22,200 --> 00:41:27,200
I mean,
for the longest time I thought that as 

729
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:29,280
this wave grew,
the probability that I would end up like

730
00:41:29,281 --> 00:41:34,281
a surfer smashed on the beach was the 
highest probability and I still probably

731
00:41:35,841 --> 00:41:38,630
think that that's the highest 
probability outcome.

732
00:41:39,130 --> 00:41:44,130
But,
but I'm not as apprehensive about that 

733
00:41:44,130 --> 00:41:48,641
now as I was because in some sense,
assuming I don't do anything 

734
00:41:50,930 --> 00:41:53,730
spectacularly stupid,
like defend count.

735
00:41:53,731 --> 00:41:55,610
Dang Kyla on Dave Rubin.

736
00:41:58,910 --> 00:42:03,910
Thank you.

737
00:42:06,410 --> 00:42:08,100
Well,
who would like to that?

738
00:42:08,240 --> 00:42:10,460
Who would have liked to have taken me 
out,

739
00:42:11,120 --> 00:42:14,420
have thrown the worst that they could 
throw at me?

740
00:42:14,510 --> 00:42:16,580
As far as I can tell.
I mean,

741
00:42:16,581 --> 00:42:17,180
my,
my,

742
00:42:17,320 --> 00:42:22,320
my cardinal day in terms of vilification
and it's quite a contest by the way 

743
00:42:23,300 --> 00:42:28,300
because there were many days like that 
was the day where I was simultaneously 

744
00:42:28,300 --> 00:42:32,351
accused by eight an all right magazine 
of being a Jewish shill and accused by 

745
00:42:33,560 --> 00:42:37,640
a,
a Jewish magazine of being tantamount to

746
00:42:37,641 --> 00:42:39,530
Hitler himself.
I thought,

747
00:42:39,531 --> 00:42:40,940
well,
that pretty much does it.

748
00:42:40,970 --> 00:42:45,770
It's like the Nazis hate me because I'm 
a Jewish shill and the,

749
00:42:45,830 --> 00:42:48,320
and well,
this particular Jewish publication,

750
00:42:48,380 --> 00:42:49,910
you know,
compared me to Hitler,

751
00:42:49,911 --> 00:42:50,480
and I thought,
well,

752
00:42:50,481 --> 00:42:51,290
that's it.
There's.

753
00:42:51,350 --> 00:42:53,680
Where else do you go after that?
We're going to call me mom.

754
00:42:54,030 --> 00:42:55,630
It's like,
it still already.

755
00:42:55,810 --> 00:42:58,310
He didn't.
That's just not that much past Hitler.

756
00:42:58,760 --> 00:43:03,760
And so you know,
and so I'm not that concerned that in 

757
00:43:03,981 --> 00:43:07,100
the absence of some fatal stupidity on 
my part,

758
00:43:07,280 --> 00:43:12,280
which certainly could still happen 
because we have that proclivity for 

759
00:43:12,280 --> 00:43:16,031
fatal stupidity within all of us.
I'm not too concerned that I'm going to 

760
00:43:16,071 --> 00:43:18,680
be taken out by my ideological 
opponents,

761
00:43:19,010 --> 00:43:24,010
but by the same token,
this is a pretty unwieldy and 

762
00:43:24,010 --> 00:43:27,240
unprecedented situation to be in.
And so I'm,

763
00:43:27,350 --> 00:43:31,160
I'm not under any illusions about its 
stability or safety.

764
00:43:31,970 --> 00:43:34,070
So who knows,
man.

765
00:43:35,790 --> 00:43:37,830
Well I'll stick with you as long as 
you'll keep me.

766
00:43:38,340 --> 00:43:39,660
So,
so far so good.

767
00:43:39,720 --> 00:43:44,720
All right.
So I promised you guys that I was going 

768
00:43:44,720 --> 00:43:44,720
to take what I thought was the best 
question from you guys.

769
00:43:44,720 --> 00:43:45,870
And there were,
there were hundreds of them.

770
00:43:45,871 --> 00:43:48,240
I was reading through them during the 
lecture,

771
00:43:48,270 --> 00:43:51,630
but I thought this was the best we got 
out of Oslo.

772
00:43:53,880 --> 00:43:56,640
Will you move to as low and run for 
Prime Minister of Norway?

773
00:44:00,110 --> 00:44:05,110
Thank you.

774
00:44:14,690 --> 00:44:19,690
Well first you probably want someone who
can speak Norwegian.

775
00:44:21,720 --> 00:44:24,020
Um,
and second,

776
00:44:24,050 --> 00:44:25,790
more seriously,
um,

777
00:44:27,680 --> 00:44:32,680
throughout my life I've considered a 
political career and certainly when I 

778
00:44:32,680 --> 00:44:32,970
was young,
very seriously,

779
00:44:32,971 --> 00:44:36,480
that was my ambition till I was about 
18.

780
00:44:37,620 --> 00:44:38,920
But,
um,

781
00:44:39,560 --> 00:44:44,560
yeah,
started when I ran for an executive 

782
00:44:46,181 --> 00:44:50,350
position in the Socialist Party in my 
home province when I was 14.

783
00:44:50,980 --> 00:44:55,980
And so that was the first large scale 
public speech I gave to about 700 

784
00:44:55,980 --> 00:44:56,940
people.
Wait,

785
00:44:56,941 --> 00:45:01,941
can everyone pause for one second?
Try to picture 14 year old socialist 

786
00:45:01,941 --> 00:45:03,840
Jordan Peterson that,
that's an incredible image to me.

787
00:45:03,841 --> 00:45:08,841
What was that kid like?
Me Kinda,

788
00:45:10,390 --> 00:45:11,020
you know,
I,

789
00:45:11,100 --> 00:45:15,710
I speak to a crowd.
Then speech was very successful.

790
00:45:15,910 --> 00:45:20,910
Um,
I lost the position by 13 votes out of 

791
00:45:20,910 --> 00:45:20,910
700,
something like that.

792
00:45:21,560 --> 00:45:26,090
And you know,
I had the audience under.

793
00:45:27,230 --> 00:45:28,670
I had the audience.
No.

794
00:45:33,670 --> 00:45:38,670
So you know,
there's certain things about you that 

795
00:45:38,670 --> 00:45:39,670
remained constant.
Hopefully I know more than I did then,

796
00:45:40,380 --> 00:45:42,460
you know,
that's to be devoted hope for.

797
00:45:43,900 --> 00:45:45,070
I've stopped

798
00:45:48,440 --> 00:45:53,440
actively pursuing a political career 
when I was 18 and the reason for that 

799
00:45:53,440 --> 00:45:56,570
was because I became more interested in 
something else,

800
00:45:56,810 --> 00:46:01,810
which is what I was talking about 
tonight because it turned out that the 

801
00:46:02,001 --> 00:46:06,350
political problems that I was interested
in were,

802
00:46:06,760 --> 00:46:11,760
were deep enough arguably not to be 
political because they were really,

803
00:46:14,090 --> 00:46:17,210
for some reason I was very interested in
totalitarianism,

804
00:46:17,211 --> 00:46:20,720
right from the time I was like an 
adolescent.

805
00:46:22,190 --> 00:46:27,190
I don't know why exactly who the hell 
knows why you get interested in what 

806
00:46:27,190 --> 00:46:28,870
your interests in some problem.
You know,

807
00:46:28,871 --> 00:46:31,140
this is a thing that's useful to know 
about life,

808
00:46:31,800 --> 00:46:36,800
you know,
all of you have problems that bothering 

809
00:46:36,800 --> 00:46:37,500
you and you think,
well,

810
00:46:37,501 --> 00:46:40,230
I don't want it to have a problem and 
fair enough,

811
00:46:40,410 --> 00:46:45,410
but like there's a whole lot of problems
you could have that could bother you 

812
00:46:45,410 --> 00:46:49,190
because there's lots of things wrong 
with the world and you can be obsessed 

813
00:46:49,190 --> 00:46:49,410
by like a million problems,
right?

814
00:46:49,411 --> 00:46:51,090
Because there's just problems 
everywhere,

815
00:46:51,091 --> 00:46:56,091
but you're not some problems grab you.
Why?

816
00:46:58,960 --> 00:47:03,960
It's a mystery history of the autonomy 
of being in some sense,

817
00:47:04,450 --> 00:47:06,730
problem grabs you and it will let you 
go.

818
00:47:06,970 --> 00:47:11,970
It's like that's suffering in that,
but that's your problem and you know in 

819
00:47:12,070 --> 00:47:15,430
that problem might be your destiny.
I think that's right,

820
00:47:15,490 --> 00:47:20,490
is in the problems that grip you are the
portal to your destiny and and so.

821
00:47:22,990 --> 00:47:24,670
Well then you can accept them.
It's like,

822
00:47:24,671 --> 00:47:27,880
what are you going to have?
No problems could good luck with that.

823
00:47:28,240 --> 00:47:33,240
So you've got your problems.
One of the things you learn as a 

824
00:47:33,240 --> 00:47:36,841
therapist,
as you don't interfere with people's 

825
00:47:36,841 --> 00:47:37,930
problems,
and what I mean by that is this.

826
00:47:37,931 --> 00:47:42,931
Let's say you come to me and we have a 
discussion about what's going wrong in 

827
00:47:42,931 --> 00:47:47,191
your life,
and I listened because I want you to 

828
00:47:47,191 --> 00:47:48,910
explain what the problems are because 
what do I know about your life?

829
00:47:48,910 --> 00:47:53,910
It's like I need to listen so that I can
hear what your problem is and not rush 

830
00:47:55,151 --> 00:48:00,151
to a conclusion and then I want to 
listen while you generate a solution.

831
00:48:01,150 --> 00:48:04,460
Now I'm going to help by asking 
questions and help you explore it,

832
00:48:04,470 --> 00:48:07,750
but if I.
let's say you lay out your problem and I

833
00:48:07,751 --> 00:48:08,170
think,
hey,

834
00:48:08,171 --> 00:48:10,510
I know what would fix that,
and then I just say to you,

835
00:48:10,511 --> 00:48:11,130
well,
you know,

836
00:48:11,260 --> 00:48:13,300
here's the solution.
Well first of all,

837
00:48:13,301 --> 00:48:18,301
you're going to be very annoyed about 
that because I just took your problem 

838
00:48:18,960 --> 00:48:22,840
and it was up to you to wrestle with 
that problem and come up with a solution

839
00:48:22,841 --> 00:48:27,841
and then to have a little self 
congratulatory burst of pleasure at your

840
00:48:29,501 --> 00:48:34,501
own intuitive genius that you could 
solve your problem and then then you're 

841
00:48:34,501 --> 00:48:36,250
motivated because you've come up with a 
solution.

842
00:48:36,251 --> 00:48:39,040
Maybe you go implement it right and so

843
00:48:40,030 --> 00:48:40,480
well.

844
00:48:42,780 --> 00:48:47,780
So my problem became something that 
wasn't political and so I pursued that 

845
00:48:47,780 --> 00:48:51,441
and so I'm not going to pursue a 
political career and I've also decided 

846
00:48:51,441 --> 00:48:51,441
to.
I didn't know this,

847
00:48:51,441 --> 00:48:54,630
but I don't have the temperament for it.
I couldn't do it.

848
00:48:55,060 --> 00:48:59,580
I find the adversarial interviews that 
I'm in,

849
00:48:59,581 --> 00:49:02,190
for example,
they take me like it takes me three days

850
00:49:02,191 --> 00:49:07,191
to recover from one of those,
what it does because I don't like that 

851
00:49:08,430 --> 00:49:12,180
motive discourse.
And if your political,

852
00:49:12,181 --> 00:49:16,500
you're in that mode of discourse all the
time and I'm not cut out for it.

853
00:49:16,750 --> 00:49:21,240
I got not a particularly combative 
person by nature.

854
00:49:21,990 --> 00:49:26,990
I'm a person who's terrified about 
leaving monsters under the rug

855
00:49:29,910 --> 00:49:30,600
ignored,

856
00:49:31,800 --> 00:49:35,700
but that is not the same thing.
And it's not like I enjoy the process of

857
00:49:36,030 --> 00:49:39,030
calling them out and hashing them 
through,

858
00:49:39,031 --> 00:49:41,970
but I think well better get out them 
while they're small.

859
00:49:42,960 --> 00:49:44,430
So,
so,

860
00:49:45,180 --> 00:49:47,040
so no,
I'm not coming to Norway.

861
00:49:47,670 --> 00:49:49,290
That's the answer to that question.

862
00:49:50,420 --> 00:49:51,830
All right,
well on that note,

863
00:49:52,370 --> 00:49:57,370
I've said this to you privately before,
but I may as well say publicly since 

864
00:49:57,370 --> 00:49:57,890
we're putting this up on the youtube,
this what we're doing here,

865
00:49:57,891 --> 00:50:00,020
this started as a professional joy for 
me,

866
00:50:00,021 --> 00:50:03,800
but it has become a personal joy that I 
can't explain.

867
00:50:03,801 --> 00:50:08,801
I am better than when we started.
Like I know what it's like to be these 

868
00:50:08,801 --> 00:50:10,370
people that taking these ideas in and 
changing and uh,

869
00:50:10,371 --> 00:50:13,850
and I'm better and it's.
And it's because of the work that you've

870
00:50:13,851 --> 00:50:16,790
put into your life that you've helped 
give to all of us.

871
00:50:16,791 --> 00:50:17,630
So,
uh,

872
00:50:17,780 --> 00:50:20,450
I want to thank you for that.
And on that note,

873
00:50:20,451 --> 00:50:22,220
I've never ended a show like this 
before,

874
00:50:22,221 --> 00:50:27,221
but I'm going to get out of the way and 
I need you guys to go bananas for Dr 

875
00:50:27,221 --> 00:50:27,221
Jordan Peterson.

876
00:50:28,130 --> 00:50:33,130
Thank you guys.
Thanks amy.
