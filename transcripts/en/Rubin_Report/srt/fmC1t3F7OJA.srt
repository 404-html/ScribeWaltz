00:00:05,150 --> 00:00:05,983
Rubin report presidents week with five 
shows in five days on five former 

2
00:00:09,621 --> 00:00:12,260
presidents of the United States in 
partnership with learn.

3
00:00:12,261 --> 00:00:17,261
Liberty continues today and joining me 
now is a professor of history at Western

4
00:00:17,451 --> 00:00:18,284
Connecticut State University and author 
of James Madison and the making of 

5
00:00:22,191 --> 00:00:23,800
America.
Kevin got made.

6
00:00:23,810 --> 00:00:25,880
Welcome to the Rubin report.
I'm happy to be here.

7
00:00:26,210 --> 00:00:31,210
I'm excited to talk to you because this 
is big because you are both an expert in

8
00:00:31,911 --> 00:00:32,744
James Madison and Thomas Jefferson.
Now everyone that's watching this knows 

9
00:00:36,621 --> 00:00:39,020
that Thomas Jefferson is my favorite 
founder.

10
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:42,710
I'm going to give you a little room here
to play and by the end,

11
00:00:42,711 --> 00:00:47,120
see if you can convince me that James 
Madison should be my favorite founder.

12
00:00:47,190 --> 00:00:48,110
Oh,
well,

13
00:00:48,111 --> 00:00:48,944
I'm not sure I want to play that game 
because actually the reason I wrote a 

14
00:00:51,201 --> 00:00:52,034
book about Madison is because over time 
I had come to think that his reputation 

15
00:00:55,941 --> 00:00:56,774
was generally exaggerated among scholars
that although he did very important 

16
00:00:59,631 --> 00:01:01,370
things and I think he should be 
remembered,

17
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:05,630
he wasn't as important as people were 
remembering him as having been.

18
00:01:05,950 --> 00:01:06,980
In fact,
in this,

19
00:01:06,981 --> 00:01:07,814
he's similar to Alexander Hamilton who 
doesn't deserve all the accolades he's 

20
00:01:11,331 --> 00:01:13,180
received from the musical Hamilton.

21
00:01:13,390 --> 00:01:14,320
Oh my.
Well,

22
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:16,170
you're shooting everywhere

23
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:18,700
now.
I'm saying they were admirable people,

24
00:01:18,701 --> 00:01:22,930
but there's a tendency among biographers
to make their guys the central guys.

25
00:01:22,931 --> 00:01:25,960
So Hamilton becomes the greatest 
American ever.

26
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:29,330
Madison becomes the smartest man ever.
You don't.

27
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:31,840
You don't need to do that.
If you make him the real fellow,

28
00:01:31,841 --> 00:01:33,700
he's still extremely interesting and 
important.

29
00:01:33,750 --> 00:01:34,583
All right?
And I think that really is what your 

30
00:01:36,391 --> 00:01:37,224
book is about,
making him the real value in showing 

31
00:01:38,731 --> 00:01:41,460
some of the flaws and some of the 
mistakes he made along the way.

32
00:01:41,461 --> 00:01:44,820
And we're gonna get into all of that.
So let's just start at the beginning.

33
00:01:44,821 --> 00:01:47,250
What should we know about James 
Madison's childhood?

34
00:01:47,770 --> 00:01:48,491
Ah,
well,

35
00:01:48,491 --> 00:01:49,324
Madison was born.
He was the first child of the most 

36
00:01:51,701 --> 00:01:54,880
important man in his county,
which was Piedmont Virginia,

37
00:01:54,881 --> 00:01:57,760
Orange County in those days,
the Piedmont region,

38
00:01:57,761 --> 00:02:00,370
which is the area just off the coast of 
Virginia,

39
00:02:00,371 --> 00:02:01,204
just out of tidewater,
was the western most extent of European 

40
00:02:04,901 --> 00:02:07,030
settlement.
And his father,

41
00:02:07,031 --> 00:02:10,180
James Madison senior,
was the wealthiest man in the county.

42
00:02:10,181 --> 00:02:13,330
He was the largest land holder.
He was the largest slave holder.

43
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:14,433
He was the county lieutenant,
which means he was the commander of the 

44
00:02:17,021 --> 00:02:19,420
county militia.
He was ahead of the vestry,

45
00:02:19,421 --> 00:02:23,440
which means he was the head of the lay 
organization that ran the county,

46
00:02:23,580 --> 00:02:28,300
a parish of the established church.
He was just the most important person.

47
00:02:28,610 --> 00:02:31,960
What this meant for James Madison junior
was he was set.

48
00:02:32,260 --> 00:02:35,290
He was going to inherit all of that.
He was going to be able to have the kind

49
00:02:35,291 --> 00:02:38,230
of education that virtually nobody else 
in Orange County would get.

50
00:02:38,710 --> 00:02:42,040
In fact,
he's maybe the only person in his cohort

51
00:02:42,041 --> 00:02:44,230
of Virginians who went off to Princeton 
to college.

52
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:47,230
Most people would go to the colonial 
college in Virginia,

53
00:02:47,231 --> 00:02:50,800
William and Mary far inferior 
institution in those days to Princeton.

54
00:02:51,130 --> 00:02:52,780
We could talk about whether it still is 
today.

55
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:55,910
That's probably a different show.
That is a different show.

56
00:02:55,911 --> 00:02:57,160
It's,
it's an interesting question.

57
00:02:57,380 --> 00:02:58,540
Um,
but anyway,

58
00:02:58,900 --> 00:03:03,900
and James Madison Junior,
because of his tie to his father and his

59
00:03:05,441 --> 00:03:08,030
father's eminent place ended up having 
a,

60
00:03:08,110 --> 00:03:08,943
not only a more elite kind of education,
but also a different outlook when it 

61
00:03:13,481 --> 00:03:14,314
came to human nature,
the relationship between government and 

62
00:03:16,841 --> 00:03:17,674
individuals,
individual rights and especially what I 

63
00:03:19,871 --> 00:03:21,640
think is the area in which he was most 
important.

64
00:03:21,641 --> 00:03:23,890
Freedom of religion than other people.

65
00:03:24,130 --> 00:03:24,963
Yeah.
And he was key in making sure that 

66
00:03:27,011 --> 00:03:30,220
separation of church and state was part 
of the US Constitution.

67
00:03:30,221 --> 00:03:31,690
Everything that's were we're going to 
get to all that.

68
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:33,033
Do we know anything about his father's 
politics or even just with even 

69
00:03:35,411 --> 00:03:37,900
interested in politics when he was 
young?

70
00:03:37,950 --> 00:03:40,470
There are,
there wasn't what we would call politics

71
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:41,990
in colonial Virginia.
There were,

72
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,510
there weren't parties,
there wasn't kind of party division.

73
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:49,350
Essentially.
People were uh,

74
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:53,190
more or less all the same elite group.
They had a common interest.

75
00:03:53,370 --> 00:03:56,550
Virtually everybody who lived in 
Virginia was either tobacco grower,

76
00:03:56,850 --> 00:03:59,790
a slave on tobacco plantation,
somebody who lived in.

77
00:03:59,791 --> 00:04:03,690
It's a small town that's the only kind 
of towns there were in Virginia and sold

78
00:04:03,691 --> 00:04:04,524
tobacco or was a lawyer who worked for 
tobacco farmers notice a common theme 

79
00:04:07,981 --> 00:04:08,814
here.
So because people had a very similar 

80
00:04:10,651 --> 00:04:11,484
kind of economic life,
they didn't have the kind of political 

81
00:04:14,371 --> 00:04:15,810
division we think of as normal.

82
00:04:15,940 --> 00:04:16,900
It's interesting.
It almost,

83
00:04:16,901 --> 00:04:19,240
it sorta sounds pre politics all 
together.

84
00:04:19,570 --> 00:04:22,990
They were just sort of local and you 
kinda had to do what you did.

85
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:24,160
Yes,
pretty much.

86
00:04:24,220 --> 00:04:25,053
That's really interesting.
So he goes off to school and is this 

87
00:04:27,101 --> 00:04:29,470
where he starts becoming more political?

88
00:04:29,510 --> 00:04:30,343
Yes.
Well what happened was he went off to 

89
00:04:32,091 --> 00:04:35,720
school in New Jersey and unlike William 
and Mary,

90
00:04:35,721 --> 00:04:36,554
which was Episcopalian,
the established Church of Virginia was 

91
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:40,250
the Church of England.

92
00:04:40,590 --> 00:04:41,423
Is that one of the reasons he didn't 
want to go there because we're going to 

93
00:04:42,630 --> 00:04:44,730
get into a little more about his 
feelings about religion,

94
00:04:44,731 --> 00:04:46,740
but obviously he wanted to go to a 
bigger school,

95
00:04:46,741 --> 00:04:49,140
but was it also very much about the 
religious school?

96
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:50,313
Well,
we don't have any indication that that 

97
00:04:51,131 --> 00:04:51,964
had anything to do with it.
It seems that the reason he went off to 

98
00:04:54,220 --> 00:04:55,053
New Jersey was because of the very crude
state of scientific knowledge in those 

99
00:04:59,710 --> 00:05:02,230
days.
So if like James Madison Junior,

100
00:05:02,231 --> 00:05:04,990
who remains the smallest man who's ever 
been president,

101
00:05:05,350 --> 00:05:09,280
if you had what he called a sickly 
constitution,

102
00:05:09,610 --> 00:05:13,540
than you would want to avoid the vapors 
around Williamsburg.

103
00:05:13,810 --> 00:05:14,643
People thought there was something in 
the air that made you sick and they had 

104
00:05:16,721 --> 00:05:21,370
no idea of mosquito born illnesses or 
any anything to do with sanitation.

105
00:05:21,430 --> 00:05:22,263
So he went off to New Jersey because he 
was afraid he'd get sick if he went to 

106
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:28,420
Williamsburg,
which is on the James near the coast.

107
00:05:28,750 --> 00:05:30,100
And so,
um,

108
00:05:30,670 --> 00:05:31,503
it was kind of fortuitous that he ended 
up at Princeton under the tutelage of 

109
00:05:36,251 --> 00:05:38,830
somebody who was a minister,
but not an episcopalian.

110
00:05:39,190 --> 00:05:40,023
And so were episcopalians at the time 
had a kind of latitude and area in a 

111
00:05:44,291 --> 00:05:45,124
very liberal religious understanding of 
people's motives and people's 

112
00:05:50,561 --> 00:05:51,340
personality.

113
00:05:51,340 --> 00:05:53,980
And so on.
If you had gone to Princeton and studied

114
00:05:53,981 --> 00:05:54,814
under John Witherspoon,
who would also be a signer of the 

115
00:05:56,411 --> 00:05:58,360
declaration of independence in time,
uh,

116
00:05:58,610 --> 00:06:01,760
you would have been under the tutelage 
of somebody who was a presbyterian.

117
00:06:01,910 --> 00:06:04,640
That is somebody who took calvinism.
Seriously.

118
00:06:04,700 --> 00:06:06,770
Somebody who thought men were naturally 
corrupt,

119
00:06:06,980 --> 00:06:07,813
somebody who was skeptical of the 
motives of other people and taught that 

120
00:06:10,611 --> 00:06:14,240
this is the way a Christian should 
understand human psychology.

121
00:06:14,450 --> 00:06:15,283
And so if you think about,
if you're familiar with and think about 

122
00:06:17,151 --> 00:06:19,910
Madison's key political writings,
for example,

123
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:24,170
famous federalist number,
51 where he says if men were angels,

124
00:06:24,171 --> 00:06:26,780
no government would be necessary,
but until we're governed by angels,

125
00:06:26,781 --> 00:06:30,500
let ambition counteract ambition.
That sounds like John Witherspoon.

126
00:06:30,530 --> 00:06:33,440
He wouldn't have been saying that if he 
had gone to school at William and Mary.

127
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:37,910
Interesting.
So a lot of his individualism was really

128
00:06:37,911 --> 00:06:38,810
born there.

129
00:06:38,870 --> 00:06:39,703
Yeah.
And the funny thing about that is 

130
00:06:40,191 --> 00:06:41,024
though,
that although the various elements of 

131
00:06:43,491 --> 00:06:46,310
what I've been saying have to do with 
weather spoons,

132
00:06:46,311 --> 00:06:48,890
religion,
and the religion of Princeton,

133
00:06:48,891 --> 00:06:52,160
generally madison was not in a 
Presbyterian.

134
00:06:53,210 --> 00:06:54,043
We have very limited information about 
what Madison's own personal religious 

135
00:06:57,921 --> 00:06:58,754
beliefs were,
but it happened that he came back to 

136
00:07:00,141 --> 00:07:02,960
Virginia and within a couple of years 
there was serious.

137
00:07:02,961 --> 00:07:03,794
There was one of the intermittent waves 
of persecution of non episcopalians and 

138
00:07:07,641 --> 00:07:10,670
then he ended up in a correspondence 
with a fellow he had known at Princeton.

139
00:07:10,671 --> 00:07:12,710
This guy was from,
from Pennsylvania,

140
00:07:12,711 --> 00:07:14,300
so he had gone back home to 
Pennsylvania,

141
00:07:14,510 --> 00:07:15,343
Pennsylvania,
like New Jersey had been founded by 

142
00:07:17,870 --> 00:07:20,750
quakers and so never had any kind of 
established church.

143
00:07:21,050 --> 00:07:23,210
Quakers disbelieved in established 
churches.

144
00:07:23,450 --> 00:07:24,283
So Madison ends up writing to this 
friend of his from Princeton who's in 

145
00:07:26,751 --> 00:07:28,790
Philadelphia and saying,
Oh,

146
00:07:28,810 --> 00:07:31,530
I'm ashamed of what's going on here in 
a.

147
00:07:31,660 --> 00:07:32,493
In a nearby county.
We have half a dozen men who are in 

148
00:07:35,530 --> 00:07:36,620
jail.
He said,

149
00:07:36,621 --> 00:07:40,490
close jail for no other offense than 
just preaching the Gospel.

150
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:45,520
Teaching people the Baptist 
understanding of a spiritual reality,

151
00:07:45,981 --> 00:07:47,720
and of course that was illegal in 
Virginia.

152
00:07:47,721 --> 00:07:50,450
So they were thrown in jail.
Madison in this fellow.

153
00:07:50,451 --> 00:07:53,630
Then think through the question,
well,

154
00:07:53,780 --> 00:07:54,613
how ot government to be involved in the 
individual's religious lives and the 

155
00:07:58,761 --> 00:08:02,210
conclusion that Madison came to was,
it shouldn't.

156
00:08:02,420 --> 00:08:03,253
That is he thought and he was going to 
come to this conclusion and helping to 

157
00:08:06,171 --> 00:08:07,004
write the first American Declaration of 
Rights to the Virginia Declaration of 

158
00:08:09,201 --> 00:08:10,034
rights of 1776 that the traditional 
English liberal and in Anglo American 

159
00:08:13,881 --> 00:08:14,714
liberal position on religion,
which is we should have toleration in 

160
00:08:17,571 --> 00:08:18,404
England.
They had a rule that you could be any 

161
00:08:19,881 --> 00:08:22,700
kind of Protestant you wanted,
which sounds very,

162
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:27,440
very oppressive to us.
Slim version of the thing is though that

163
00:08:27,441 --> 00:08:30,170
in the context in the 18th century,
if you were French,

164
00:08:30,171 --> 00:08:31,400
you had to be a catholic.

165
00:08:31,670 --> 00:08:33,560
If you are Turkish,
you had to be a Muslim.

166
00:08:33,830 --> 00:08:35,900
If you were in England and you were not 
an episcopalian,

167
00:08:35,901 --> 00:08:38,180
you couldn't be in the House of Lords or
couldn't be in the House of Commons.

168
00:08:38,181 --> 00:08:39,014
You couldn't go to Oxford or Cambridge,
but in general the English role was 

169
00:08:43,431 --> 00:08:44,264
we'll tolerate you.
We won't punish you for not being an 

170
00:08:45,951 --> 00:08:49,250
Episcopalian.
So that's not like France or Spain or or

171
00:08:49,310 --> 00:08:50,143
Turkey and I'm Madison,
ends up with this idea that toleration 

172
00:08:55,350 --> 00:08:56,183
isn't enough and so when they're 
drafting the Virginia Declaration of 

173
00:08:59,820 --> 00:09:01,260
Rights,
the first American bill of rights,

174
00:09:01,530 --> 00:09:02,363
the committee version of a religious 
article of the declaration of Rights of 

175
00:09:05,740 --> 00:09:09,780
said Virginians will be entitled to the 
fullest toleration matters of religion.

176
00:09:09,781 --> 00:09:10,614
That was George Mason's formulation.
He was a very liberal fellow when it 

177
00:09:13,561 --> 00:09:15,000
came to these questions.
And Madison,

178
00:09:15,001 --> 00:09:17,580
age 25,
the youngest man in the room says,

179
00:09:17,790 --> 00:09:19,170
I disapprove of this.

180
00:09:19,410 --> 00:09:20,243
I think that toleration implies that the
government one knows more than the 

181
00:09:23,551 --> 00:09:28,530
individual to is in a supervisory role 
over the individual.

182
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:31,710
And I think these are both incorrect 
ideas.

183
00:09:31,980 --> 00:09:34,410
The government should just stay out of 
these things.

184
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:35,333
So Madison said,
I propose an alternative that we should 

185
00:09:37,531 --> 00:09:40,590
say Virginia's are entitled to the Free 
Exercise of religion.

186
00:09:41,130 --> 00:09:44,220
And when Mason heard this explanation,
he said,

187
00:09:44,221 --> 00:09:46,350
I endorse this.
And then the committee,

188
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:47,233
the whole convention voted and they 
voted unanimously for Madison is 

189
00:09:49,921 --> 00:09:51,930
formulation.
So in my book I say,

190
00:09:51,931 --> 00:09:54,480
and this is not a common view,
I say,

191
00:09:54,630 --> 00:09:57,030
I think this is the most important thing
madison ever did.

192
00:09:57,031 --> 00:09:58,850
He came up with this idea that 
government should,

193
00:09:59,130 --> 00:10:02,520
should not be telling people what to 
think about the afterlife,

194
00:10:02,521 --> 00:10:05,160
about religious ethics,
about what church to attend.

195
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:08,370
It shouldn't say we're going to be 
tolerant of you if you're wrong,

196
00:10:08,371 --> 00:10:11,610
but we're going to have our own right 
views as was going on in England.

197
00:10:11,940 --> 00:10:16,940
And he would of course later be the one 
who ensured that this phrase,

198
00:10:17,711 --> 00:10:20,730
ology free exercise will be in the 
federal constitution.

199
00:10:21,380 --> 00:10:22,600
Gosh,
you gave me a lot to work with.

200
00:10:22,601 --> 00:10:23,800
They're so.
It's such an.

201
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:25,990
It's such an interesting point though,
that you're making,

202
00:10:25,991 --> 00:10:26,824
because we talked so much about 
tolerance these days and he was saying 

203
00:10:29,801 --> 00:10:30,281
back then,
no,

204
00:10:30,281 --> 00:10:30,461
no,
no,

205
00:10:30,461 --> 00:10:31,990
no,
tolerance isn't enough.

206
00:10:32,020 --> 00:10:34,150
We need,
we need true freedom.

207
00:10:34,151 --> 00:10:36,520
Here was he really worked through that 
easy.

208
00:10:36,550 --> 00:10:37,383
I mean everyone,
George Mason and everybody heard it and 

209
00:10:38,670 --> 00:10:40,210
that quickly or like,
yeah,

210
00:10:41,030 --> 00:10:44,930
they agreed to include it in the 
declaration of rights and they agreed as

211
00:10:44,931 --> 00:10:45,764
soon as,
as they got to this question of 

212
00:10:47,451 --> 00:10:50,960
formulating their own new form of 
government during the revolution,

213
00:10:51,290 --> 00:10:52,123
they agreed that they would discontinue 
taxing people to support the Anglican 

214
00:10:55,131 --> 00:10:56,420
Church,
the episcopal church,

215
00:10:56,870 --> 00:11:01,700
but it was going to be a long struggle 
to have formal this establishment of the

216
00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:04,600
Church of England in Virginia.
So Madison was central to that too.

217
00:11:04,690 --> 00:11:05,523
He and Jeff Jefferson wrote a bill 
called the Virginia statutes religious 

218
00:11:07,791 --> 00:11:09,810
freedom now,
but he proposed it.

219
00:11:09,811 --> 00:11:10,644
It was defeated Madison 10 years later 
ensured that an alternative taxing 

220
00:11:15,171 --> 00:11:16,004
people to support whatever form of 
Christianity you wanted would be 

221
00:11:18,471 --> 00:11:21,380
defeated.
And then he brushed off Jefferson's bill

222
00:11:21,381 --> 00:11:22,060
and said,
we need,

223
00:11:22,060 --> 00:11:24,350
we need to pass this.
So it happened.

224
00:11:24,351 --> 00:11:27,920
Virginia became the first officially 
secular society ever anywhere.

225
00:11:28,530 --> 00:11:31,970
It's really incredible.
So he was 25 when he started this.

226
00:11:32,420 --> 00:11:33,910
So how old are you?
What I done?

227
00:11:34,170 --> 00:11:37,720
I'm 41.
I'm 54 and I've done nothing right.

228
00:11:37,730 --> 00:11:40,610
The Madison came up with this one.
If he had dropped dead when he was 25,

229
00:11:40,890 --> 00:11:42,950
he would still be one of the 10 most 
important American.

230
00:11:43,090 --> 00:11:44,560
Yeah,
it is incredible,

231
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:46,360
but it's such as we're going to get to 
all the other things.

232
00:11:46,361 --> 00:11:48,970
He did that through line to all the 
freedoms that we have right now.

233
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:53,260
You briefly said that we don't know much
about his actual religious beliefs.

234
00:11:53,650 --> 00:11:55,540
Do we know anything actually because 
there's.

235
00:11:55,710 --> 00:11:58,690
There seems to be this debate these days
about what they want.

236
00:11:58,691 --> 00:12:01,390
Most of the founders actually believed 
because you know,

237
00:12:01,391 --> 00:12:02,224
they were talking about rights from God 
and yet so many of them obviously 

238
00:12:06,161 --> 00:12:06,994
Madison but Jefferson included and 
others were also so it was so important 

239
00:12:10,030 --> 00:12:10,863
to talk about a separation of church and
state where they all just deists do we 

240
00:12:13,841 --> 00:12:16,480
have a sense of,
have any insight into that?

241
00:12:16,630 --> 00:12:19,870
Well,
we have information about some people,

242
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:24,400
but the term founders is very nebulous.
What do you mean by that?

243
00:12:24,430 --> 00:12:26,890
That's the problem.
So often people say,

244
00:12:26,891 --> 00:12:27,724
well,
all the founders believed this and 

245
00:12:28,361 --> 00:12:30,550
they're talking about six guys or eight 
guys.

246
00:12:30,850 --> 00:12:31,360
My,
uh,

247
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:32,193
my own view is that that term should be 
understood to include people who signed 

248
00:12:36,281 --> 00:12:37,114
the declaration of independence,
who were involved in Philadelphia 

249
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:42,490
Convention and writing the constitution 
who were in the ratification conventions

250
00:12:42,491 --> 00:12:43,324
and agreed to the constitution who were 
in the congress that proposed the bill 

251
00:12:45,641 --> 00:12:46,740
of rights,
uh,

252
00:12:46,870 --> 00:12:49,300
who were involved in the debate about 
whether to adopt the bill of rights.

253
00:12:49,390 --> 00:12:50,223
So I use that term far more broadly and 
if you understand the term broadly as 

254
00:12:54,311 --> 00:12:55,144
I've just been most,
most overwhelmingly Americans were very 

255
00:12:57,611 --> 00:12:58,444
religious in general.
They were evangelical Christians and so 

256
00:13:02,231 --> 00:13:05,000
they did not have this kind of,
um,

257
00:13:06,700 --> 00:13:10,030
to each his own attitude about these 
things that Madison or Jefferson did

258
00:13:10,250 --> 00:13:11,083
so,
so in an interesting way was their 

259
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:14,660
reasoning for church and state to be 
separated.

260
00:13:14,661 --> 00:13:16,730
Not so much that they were anti religion
but,

261
00:13:16,731 --> 00:13:17,564
but the,
but because they saw the way religion 

262
00:13:18,831 --> 00:13:20,920
was so intertwined with,
you know,

263
00:13:20,940 --> 00:13:24,500
the monarchy and the government back in 
England without.

264
00:13:24,660 --> 00:13:25,493
Was that really the key of it?
It wasn't necessarily an anti religious 

265
00:13:28,010 --> 00:13:28,450
stance.

266
00:13:28,450 --> 00:13:29,560
Well,
it wasn't only in England.

267
00:13:29,561 --> 00:13:30,660
Madison wrote a,
a,

268
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:32,620
a,
a pamphlet.

269
00:13:32,730 --> 00:13:33,563
I'm in the seventies and eighties called
memorial and remonstrance against 

270
00:13:36,041 --> 00:13:36,874
religious assessments and there he was 
answering that proposal I mentioned 

271
00:13:40,841 --> 00:13:41,674
before for having a general tax in 
Virginia to support the Christian 

272
00:13:46,250 --> 00:13:48,310
congregation of one's choice.
Right?

273
00:13:48,311 --> 00:13:49,144
So Patrick Henry had said,
we've had a decline in morals in 

274
00:13:51,581 --> 00:13:52,414
Virginia during the war.
We want to resuscitate them in one way 

275
00:13:54,911 --> 00:13:55,744
to have that happen would be to return 
to a situation in which people actually 

276
00:13:58,841 --> 00:14:01,210
go to church,
which they support a church,

277
00:14:01,330 --> 00:14:02,163
so we're going to say not that you have 
to support the church of England 

278
00:14:04,601 --> 00:14:06,460
anymore,
but you have to choose something.

279
00:14:06,790 --> 00:14:11,140
You have to choose one and designated.
And so Madison in response to this,

280
00:14:11,170 --> 00:14:12,003
among other things,
wrote a pamphlet called Memorial 

281
00:14:13,721 --> 00:14:14,554
remonstrance against religious 
assessments where he argued against 

282
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:19,840
having the government support any 
religion at all.

283
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:25,200
And his grounds for making that argument
was that this had been a harmful.

284
00:14:26,470 --> 00:14:30,580
A tendency of governments forever.
Right?

285
00:14:30,581 --> 00:14:33,460
So it wasn't only in England,
it wasn't only particular time.

286
00:14:33,670 --> 00:14:38,670
He argued that it had been harmful to 
people into societies in general,

287
00:14:38,861 --> 00:14:41,530
wherever it had been tried,
which was essentially everywhere.

288
00:14:41,980 --> 00:14:43,210
And he wanted that to stop.

289
00:14:43,490 --> 00:14:47,090
Do we know anything about what they all 
thought this whole crew,

290
00:14:47,091 --> 00:14:47,924
whether you count the founders as the 
six to eight or sort of the broader 

291
00:14:50,390 --> 00:14:52,220
group that you're talking,
that they really

292
00:14:52,220 --> 00:14:56,090
realized how important the work they 
were doing was?

293
00:14:57,280 --> 00:14:58,050
Sure.
Yeah.

294
00:14:58,050 --> 00:14:59,750
Actually,
it's funny,

295
00:15:00,050 --> 00:15:00,883
although a John Adams in Massachusetts 
and Thomas Jefferson in Virginia didn't 

296
00:15:04,311 --> 00:15:05,144
know each other at the time.
Each of them when he was very young man 

297
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:10,430
wrote a letter in which he closed by 
saying,

298
00:15:10,670 --> 00:15:12,350
save this letter.
People are gonna.

299
00:15:12,351 --> 00:15:15,350
Want to read my letters?
Jefferson was a teenager when he,

300
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:17,690
when he said that,
and by the time he died,

301
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:21,950
68 years later,
I'm 67,

302
00:15:21,951 --> 00:15:23,510
something like that.
By the time he died,

303
00:15:23,511 --> 00:15:28,010
he'd saved over 30,000
documents he'd written and the same John

304
00:15:28,010 --> 00:15:31,550
Adams and attorney writing to his 
beloved Abigail Smith.

305
00:15:31,610 --> 00:15:35,180
Later Abigail Adams said,
saved this letter.

306
00:15:35,181 --> 00:15:36,014
People don't want to read my letters.
And actually people like Jefferson 

307
00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:41,450
Madison and Alexander Hamilton,
Washington,

308
00:15:41,630 --> 00:15:44,690
they saved all their documents.
They saved all their notes.

309
00:15:44,750 --> 00:15:48,590
They had the idea that what they were 
doing was really important and they also

310
00:15:48,591 --> 00:15:51,280
had the idea that there was inadequate 
information about the,

311
00:15:51,610 --> 00:15:56,610
the fundamental commitments and 
decisions of most other societies.

312
00:15:56,840 --> 00:16:00,300
So they wanted to make a record.
It's just fascinating to think about it.

313
00:16:00,970 --> 00:16:01,803
It's truly before the birth of a nation 
and we're doing this in places where 

314
00:16:05,060 --> 00:16:05,893
they couldn't tweet at each other or get
on the phone with each other and I 

315
00:16:07,991 --> 00:16:09,800
haven't really figured this well.
If they have been able to tweet,

316
00:16:09,801 --> 00:16:11,510
they wouldn't have written much.
Right.

317
00:16:11,511 --> 00:16:12,720
So that's the thing,
you know now,

318
00:16:13,260 --> 00:16:14,093
I mean,
I feel kind of sorry as a historian of 

319
00:16:15,501 --> 00:16:18,020
late 18th,
early 19th centuries for people who want

320
00:16:18,021 --> 00:16:20,720
to work on contemporary stuff because 
we've seen.

321
00:16:20,750 --> 00:16:21,583
I mean,
even if the law says save all your 

322
00:16:23,031 --> 00:16:25,410
emails,
you might find $60,000

323
00:16:25,411 --> 00:16:26,930
and just disappeared.
You know,

324
00:16:26,931 --> 00:16:27,764
who knows what happened in.
And the plan is that nobody will ever 

325
00:16:30,201 --> 00:16:30,951
read that.
Right?

326
00:16:30,951 --> 00:16:32,840
Well,
of course the special council found it,

327
00:16:33,100 --> 00:16:35,420
but for most people I have a feeling 
that just,

328
00:16:35,450 --> 00:16:36,283
just reams of this stuff is trashed and 
that means future historians have no 

329
00:16:39,861 --> 00:16:40,694
information.

330
00:16:41,150 --> 00:16:41,983
They're going to have a cascade of stuff
and there are big libraries full of 

331
00:16:45,021 --> 00:16:45,854
books,
but most of the secret things we'd 

332
00:16:47,180 --> 00:16:50,270
actually like to be able to read that 
went into their decision making.

333
00:16:50,420 --> 00:16:51,253
They've intentionally wrecked.
That's why there's such richness to 

334
00:16:53,961 --> 00:16:54,960
this,
you know,

335
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:57,180
hundred year period or so.
Um,

336
00:16:57,740 --> 00:17:01,370
do we know anything about who the other 
formative people were around him?

337
00:17:01,371 --> 00:17:03,620
Who were the other people that really 
influenced his ideas?

338
00:17:04,220 --> 00:17:05,080
Ah,
well,

339
00:17:05,100 --> 00:17:09,410
there are people he read,
but a witherspoon is in a place for him,

340
00:17:09,411 --> 00:17:12,680
like William Small,
who was a professor at William and Mary,

341
00:17:12,681 --> 00:17:13,514
who had the most influence on Jefferson.
And then Madison had particular past 

342
00:17:19,401 --> 00:17:21,620
writers who were really influential with
him.

343
00:17:21,950 --> 00:17:22,783
One was the borrower and a French 
political scientist who wrote a book 

344
00:17:26,481 --> 00:17:27,314
called the law,
the spirit of the laws in which he 

345
00:17:29,451 --> 00:17:30,284
examined Roman history in British 
history and tried to deduce rules of 

346
00:17:35,181 --> 00:17:39,080
political science.
So Madison carefully considered,

347
00:17:39,260 --> 00:17:40,610
wants,
excuse writing,

348
00:17:40,611 --> 00:17:41,444
and adopted some of it as his own and 
then morphed other parts of it so that 

349
00:17:46,551 --> 00:17:49,040
you couldn't recognize them as having 
come from Montesquieu.

350
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:50,153
But you can see that the influence of 
bunch of skin is very significant for 

351
00:17:52,471 --> 00:17:53,170
him.
So that's,

352
00:17:53,170 --> 00:17:56,400
that's one example there Sir William 
Blackstone and who was a leading,

353
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:57,473
uh,
English legal thinker was influential 

354
00:18:00,660 --> 00:18:01,493
virtually across the spectrum of 
American legal and political thought 

355
00:18:05,130 --> 00:18:07,050
that Jefferson said negative things 
about him,

356
00:18:07,051 --> 00:18:08,650
but he was influenced by him anyway.

357
00:18:10,830 --> 00:18:12,710
Besides that,
historians,

358
00:18:12,750 --> 00:18:14,160
Greek and Roman writers,
you know,

359
00:18:14,161 --> 00:18:17,160
if you have little kids reading the 
ceased to see spot run,

360
00:18:17,161 --> 00:18:18,360
they're going to learn that when they're
a little bit,

361
00:18:18,361 --> 00:18:19,194
if you have little kids reading about 
cincinnatus and his is a short lived 

362
00:18:24,451 --> 00:18:25,284
dictatorship in Rome and,
and a renunciation of dictatorial 

363
00:18:28,081 --> 00:18:30,330
authority at the end of the war,
then they're going to learn that kind of

364
00:18:30,331 --> 00:18:31,164
thing when they're little a.
So this is one reason why I think see 

365
00:18:33,331 --> 00:18:35,870
spot run is very harmful to people.
You know,

366
00:18:36,090 --> 00:18:36,923
even if we're,
we have our youngest children learning 

367
00:18:38,671 --> 00:18:40,950
to read that way.
We might think,

368
00:18:40,951 --> 00:18:42,540
well,
that's the best way to have the kid come

369
00:18:42,541 --> 00:18:43,374
out with a 3000 word vocabulary,
but when he gets through he hasn't 

370
00:18:46,681 --> 00:18:48,060
learned.
He doesn't know anything.

371
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:49,350
So.
So,

372
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:51,720
uh,
the point was that there are,

373
00:18:51,930 --> 00:18:52,763
there are a few roman historians and 
Greek historians when we can see having 

374
00:18:56,281 --> 00:18:58,560
influenced virtually all of these 
people.

375
00:18:58,561 --> 00:19:00,060
They were all influenced.
Now,

376
00:19:00,061 --> 00:19:02,460
I'm sorry,
they were all educated by learning Greek

377
00:19:02,461 --> 00:19:03,300
learning,
Latin,

378
00:19:03,510 --> 00:19:06,030
reading the Greek poets,
reading the Roman poets,

379
00:19:06,031 --> 00:19:07,790
reading the Greek historians,
Roman historians,

380
00:19:08,070 --> 00:19:08,903
Greek philosophers.
They actually argue about which Greek 

381
00:19:10,231 --> 00:19:12,780
philosophers they like and don't like.
And so can you imagine,

382
00:19:12,781 --> 00:19:14,070
you know,
let's have a debate between,

383
00:19:14,360 --> 00:19:15,193
I don't know,
Joe Biden and Mitt Romney over your 

384
00:19:16,561 --> 00:19:18,290
favorite Roman historian.
Yeah.

385
00:19:18,550 --> 00:19:19,383
So,
so we just know nowadays people who are 

386
00:19:22,051 --> 00:19:22,884
quote unquote educated,
even in our supposedly finest 

387
00:19:25,681 --> 00:19:27,990
institutions,
they don't come out of it knowing much.

388
00:19:28,210 --> 00:19:29,090
Yeah.
Well that's,

389
00:19:29,220 --> 00:19:31,500
that's why I like asking these questions
because it's like,

390
00:19:31,501 --> 00:19:32,334
wow,
these guys really were the thinkers of 

391
00:19:33,961 --> 00:19:34,794
their time to read all the intellectual 
work to become the people they are 

392
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:39,160
versus now.
I mean,

393
00:19:39,250 --> 00:19:40,083
and it just happened that the,
the educational establishment of their 

394
00:19:44,331 --> 00:19:45,164
time was pumping stuff into their brains
that would be not only useful for 

395
00:19:50,301 --> 00:19:52,880
politicians,
but also useful to make a man,

396
00:19:52,881 --> 00:19:55,700
a good man,
to help him decide what good meant,

397
00:19:55,730 --> 00:19:58,160
to help him decide how he might follow 
that path.

398
00:19:58,490 --> 00:19:59,750
And today again,
I think,

399
00:20:00,110 --> 00:20:00,943
uh,
the education system of which I'm part 

400
00:20:02,211 --> 00:20:04,710
is kind of void of this consideration 
even

401
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:05,793
we do.
We could probably do a whole show on 

402
00:20:07,301 --> 00:20:08,500
that.
Obviously.

403
00:20:08,501 --> 00:20:10,720
We talk a lot about the education system
in general here.

404
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:12,033
You mentioned his wife briefly.
What else do we have to know about his 

405
00:20:13,121 --> 00:20:16,090
personal life as he's somewhere in his 
twenties now,

406
00:20:16,330 --> 00:20:18,070
before we get to all the other stuff?

407
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:19,860
Well,
James Madison was slight.

408
00:20:20,190 --> 00:20:22,470
He was reserved.
He was quiet.

409
00:20:23,570 --> 00:20:26,460
There are various people who met him and
said he was unattractive.

410
00:20:26,700 --> 00:20:31,060
He was not good in a group.
So he ended up in,

411
00:20:31,070 --> 00:20:34,710
when he was in his thirties,
he had a kind of flirtation,

412
00:20:34,711 --> 00:20:35,544
which apparently became serious,
at least on his end with a much younger 

413
00:20:38,521 --> 00:20:39,980
woman.
And,

414
00:20:39,981 --> 00:20:40,814
uh,
it seems from his cryptic statements to 

415
00:20:42,781 --> 00:20:43,614
Jefferson that maybe he was planning and
engagement and then that fell through 

416
00:20:46,990 --> 00:20:49,840
and then later on we all know of Dolly 
Madison,

417
00:20:49,841 --> 00:20:51,910
who was a widow whom he ended up 
marrying.

418
00:20:51,911 --> 00:20:55,780
She had been married and had children,
one of whom had died.

419
00:20:55,781 --> 00:20:56,614
And then she had a surviving son.
The two of them were married for very 

420
00:20:59,021 --> 00:21:00,730
long time.
People who saw them together,

421
00:21:00,731 --> 00:21:04,090
so they seem very happy somehow.
They never had any offspring,

422
00:21:04,450 --> 00:21:05,283
so we,
I guess were left to deduce that more 

423
00:21:06,791 --> 00:21:08,890
likely than not,
he was physically incapable,

424
00:21:08,891 --> 00:21:09,940
but we don't know that.

425
00:21:10,280 --> 00:21:13,180
Um,
but in any event,

426
00:21:13,181 --> 00:21:14,014
he didn't have any fiscal offspring.
What about the nature of his friendship 

427
00:21:16,781 --> 00:21:18,360
with Thomas Jefferson?
Because they,

428
00:21:18,610 --> 00:21:19,443
they definitely had a lot in common,
but there was definitely stark 

429
00:21:22,661 --> 00:21:23,540
differences as well.
Right?

430
00:21:23,590 --> 00:21:24,250
Well,
they had,

431
00:21:24,250 --> 00:21:25,083
they had quite a lot in common.
I think nowadays it's interesting for 

432
00:21:28,091 --> 00:21:30,640
scholars to ponder the extent to which 
they were divergent.

433
00:21:31,210 --> 00:21:35,800
And I think if either of them recognize 
the divergence that was more Madison who

434
00:21:35,801 --> 00:21:37,660
realized that they weren't exactly a 
like,

435
00:21:38,020 --> 00:21:38,853
can we just briefly,
let's do some of the things that they 

436
00:21:39,941 --> 00:21:41,490
basically agreed on.
Okay.

437
00:21:41,491 --> 00:21:42,730
Well what did they agree on?
What they agreed on?

438
00:21:42,731 --> 00:21:45,730
Republicanism.
They agreed on freedom of conscience.

439
00:21:45,940 --> 00:21:48,460
They agreed that the state and the 
church shouldn't be related.

440
00:21:48,910 --> 00:21:49,743
They agreed that in general you'd like 
to have a nowadays what we call a non 

441
00:21:53,051 --> 00:21:56,770
interventionist foreign policy because 
that had all kinds of,

442
00:21:57,040 --> 00:22:00,610
or I should say that the opposite of a 
non interventionist foreign policy would

443
00:22:00,611 --> 00:22:03,220
have all kinds of negative political,
philosophical,

444
00:22:03,221 --> 00:22:05,260
social,
economic consequences.

445
00:22:05,530 --> 00:22:06,363
So both of them agreed where possible 
stay of wars where possible just have 

446
00:22:10,241 --> 00:22:11,740
free trade,
don't,

447
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:16,400
don't try to jigger your economy and 
your network of trade relationships to,

448
00:22:16,580 --> 00:22:18,220
to favor yourself.
And,

449
00:22:18,520 --> 00:22:19,353
and uh,
the two of them agreed about a monarchy 

450
00:22:22,691 --> 00:22:26,280
and how harmful it had been over time 
and various European countries and that,

451
00:22:26,290 --> 00:22:29,500
that was to be avoided.
So these are the main things.

452
00:22:29,501 --> 00:22:31,300
And I think also,
although I said before,

453
00:22:31,301 --> 00:22:35,350
we don't have good proof of Madison's 
own religious commitments,

454
00:22:36,040 --> 00:22:40,510
Jefferson was one who you may know 
people like this who didn't have,

455
00:22:40,660 --> 00:22:41,493
who didn't have any friends who 
disagreed with him about major 

456
00:22:43,751 --> 00:22:44,880
questions,
you know,

457
00:22:45,130 --> 00:22:45,963
somebody like Madison or John Marshall 
or John Randolph of roanoke or some 

458
00:22:49,841 --> 00:22:50,674
other contemporaries of theirs had 
friends with whom they had market 

459
00:22:53,951 --> 00:22:55,510
disagreements.
But Jefferson.

460
00:22:56,210 --> 00:22:59,670
No.
So it's very much against my ethos.

461
00:22:59,690 --> 00:23:00,880
Yeah,
you're moving.

462
00:23:02,350 --> 00:23:04,090
So I think the thing is that,
uh,

463
00:23:04,810 --> 00:23:05,643
um,
at least in so far as Jefferson 

464
00:23:07,721 --> 00:23:10,030
understood it,
they must have been pretty close when it

465
00:23:10,031 --> 00:23:13,090
came to these kinds of questions.
So what were those divergent?

466
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:17,770
Well,
Jefferson was a more radical thinker.

467
00:23:17,771 --> 00:23:22,390
He was less trepidatious about trying 
the novel,

468
00:23:22,391 --> 00:23:26,740
about overthrowing the established.
So for example,

469
00:23:27,010 --> 00:23:27,843
he wrote that he thought that every 
constitution should be void after 19 

470
00:23:31,631 --> 00:23:32,920
years.
Well,

471
00:23:32,921 --> 00:23:36,550
Madison had played the key role in 
writing the US Constitution.

472
00:23:36,760 --> 00:23:39,400
He thought had been a near run thing.
At one point he said he thought it was a

473
00:23:39,401 --> 00:23:43,990
miracle by which he meant it was very 
unlikely that you'd end up with any kind

474
00:23:43,991 --> 00:23:46,460
of agreement in Philadelphia in the 
summer of 17,

475
00:23:46,461 --> 00:23:47,294
87,
let alone that will be ratified by all 

476
00:23:48,501 --> 00:23:49,970
13 states within,
you know,

477
00:23:50,300 --> 00:23:52,850
three years.
So he didn't,

478
00:23:52,910 --> 00:23:54,470
he didn't want to try that again.

479
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:55,833
For Jefferson and the,
the practical pragmatic question of 

480
00:23:59,451 --> 00:24:02,930
whether this was feasible was less an 
issue than,

481
00:24:03,620 --> 00:24:05,000
well,
is it a good idea?

482
00:24:05,060 --> 00:24:05,893
Is this what we should do?
Do we want to be able to say that you 

483
00:24:07,431 --> 00:24:10,610
have literal consent from everybody 
every once in a while.

484
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:13,700
And so where did the 19 years.
Well,

485
00:24:13,701 --> 00:24:15,160
he,
Jefferson had come,

486
00:24:15,230 --> 00:24:19,070
had calculated that had a generation,
was more or less 19 years.

487
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:22,970
So he thought that if you had an end to 
every constitution every 19 years,

488
00:24:22,971 --> 00:24:25,040
then every person who lived in a,
a,

489
00:24:25,310 --> 00:24:27,740
you know,
a kind of a standard,

490
00:24:27,820 --> 00:24:28,653
a lifespan would have least once or 
twice when he was involved in agreeing 

491
00:24:32,541 --> 00:24:35,540
to a constitution,
agreeing to a political system.

492
00:24:35,870 --> 00:24:38,180
And in general,
you should live under a political system

493
00:24:38,181 --> 00:24:41,000
to which you had agreed,
but nowadays we have the idea that,

494
00:24:41,001 --> 00:24:41,930
well,
okay,

495
00:24:41,931 --> 00:24:42,764
society in general,
Americans agreed to the US Constitution 

496
00:24:45,771 --> 00:24:47,120
even though you didn't.
And I didn't.

497
00:24:47,630 --> 00:24:48,920
Uh,
I guess if you're an immigrant,

498
00:24:48,921 --> 00:24:51,110
you have to agree to it.
But,

499
00:24:51,260 --> 00:24:52,310
uh,
if you're born here,

500
00:24:52,311 --> 00:24:53,144
you don't.
And that Jefferson thought this was a 

501
00:24:54,411 --> 00:24:55,244
problem and we want to avoid this,
we need to figure a way around it from 

502
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,020
Addison.
Don't talk about that.

503
00:25:00,021 --> 00:25:01,610
This was really hard to do,
you know,

504
00:25:01,611 --> 00:25:04,640
and it's not likely it'll be better if 
we try to remake it.

505
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:05,833
So

506
00:25:07,150 --> 00:25:07,983
he's feeling they're really.
That we would sort of forget about the 

507
00:25:09,961 --> 00:25:10,794
freedoms that we started with and that 
every generation would kind of forget 

508
00:25:14,551 --> 00:25:15,750
and we'd sort of keep wiggling.

509
00:25:15,850 --> 00:25:16,960
Well,
there was that too,

510
00:25:17,050 --> 00:25:19,150
actually.
He said at one point,

511
00:25:19,151 --> 00:25:21,550
I wish I could recall the exact words,
but he said something like,

512
00:25:21,730 --> 00:25:24,670
from the moment the revolution ends will
be on the decline.

513
00:25:25,210 --> 00:25:26,043
Right?
So his feeling was that people's 

514
00:25:27,820 --> 00:25:31,750
attentiveness to these questions of 
political legitimacy,

515
00:25:31,751 --> 00:25:32,584
the proper structure of government,
the extent to which an individual's 

516
00:25:36,370 --> 00:25:39,880
humanity ought to be respected by the 
system and society,

517
00:25:40,630 --> 00:25:41,463
the acuteness of people's awareness of 
these things would immediately drop off 

518
00:25:45,251 --> 00:25:46,084
and then we'd continue to drop off.
And so how do you prevent that from 

519
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:51,040
ending in?
Well,

520
00:25:51,041 --> 00:25:52,490
the people in government pay attention 
to.

521
00:25:52,491 --> 00:25:55,690
Nobody else does.
Periodically you have a new constitution

522
00:25:55,691 --> 00:25:57,520
to create it.
You have to go through the whole process

523
00:25:57,521 --> 00:25:59,050
again.
Everybody's going to be involved,

524
00:25:59,051 --> 00:25:59,884
it'll be a hot topic.
And so for Madison this is speculative 

525
00:26:03,791 --> 00:26:05,950
and wow,
this could have really bad results.

526
00:26:05,951 --> 00:26:06,784
So

527
00:26:07,060 --> 00:26:08,880
Huh.
It's interesting because I think you can

528
00:26:08,881 --> 00:26:12,060
make probably really strong arguments on
either side of that.

529
00:26:12,270 --> 00:26:14,220
So this must have really been a point 
for the two of them.

530
00:26:14,230 --> 00:26:14,701
Yeah,
they,

531
00:26:14,701 --> 00:26:18,960
they disagreed about it in print and in 
writing.

532
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:22,590
Yeah.
So James Madison wrote,

533
00:26:23,130 --> 00:26:25,290
I mean there's so much stuff that either
he was directly writing,

534
00:26:25,291 --> 00:26:28,380
like the federalist papers that he was 
editing and zillion other things.

535
00:26:28,570 --> 00:26:31,850
Is this a good point to talk about the 
federalist papers we need to live up you

536
00:26:31,851 --> 00:26:32,684
want.
Is there anything else we should lead 

537
00:26:33,181 --> 00:26:33,560
up?

538
00:26:33,560 --> 00:26:36,610
Let me just say about them in general 
that they are highly.

539
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:37,633
Their influences.
Highly exaggerated in the general 

540
00:26:39,371 --> 00:26:40,950
understanding.
Really the.

541
00:26:40,990 --> 00:26:41,823
Yes,
because I told got a bottle of wine 

542
00:26:44,041 --> 00:26:46,440
that's called the federalists Madison's 
picture on.

543
00:26:47,140 --> 00:26:51,780
It's a standard issue,
a silhouette of Madison.

544
00:26:51,781 --> 00:26:52,614
I.
I is celebrate the person who designed 

545
00:26:55,261 --> 00:26:56,094
the logo,
but the thing is among those of us who 

546
00:26:58,681 --> 00:26:59,514
are specialists in this area,
there's a kind of consensus that the 

547
00:27:02,311 --> 00:27:05,760
federalist did not persuade.
We cannot prove.

548
00:27:05,761 --> 00:27:06,594
We cannot identify one person who was 
persuaded to vote yes in a ratification 

549
00:27:10,081 --> 00:27:13,110
convention because he read the 
federalist and was persuaded.

550
00:27:13,530 --> 00:27:14,363
So in other words,
the idea that you're kind of taught in 

551
00:27:16,321 --> 00:27:19,260
eighth grade and then in high school,
you know,

552
00:27:19,261 --> 00:27:22,590
and then law school if to do that is 
well,

553
00:27:22,591 --> 00:27:23,424
here are these.
Here are these papers that were used to 

554
00:27:25,291 --> 00:27:27,420
go out and get the people to support the
constitution.

555
00:27:27,730 --> 00:27:28,563
That was their purpose,
but we don't know that they did and in 

556
00:27:31,291 --> 00:27:34,950
fact by the time the last of them was 
published,

557
00:27:34,980 --> 00:27:38,670
that is by the time the last of them was
seen by anybody anywhere.

558
00:27:39,150 --> 00:27:41,190
Eight states had already ratified the 
constitution,

559
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:45,120
so clearly our eight states that weren't
persuaded by at least those last ones,

560
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:46,313
and then there were all.
There were some states where none of 

561
00:27:48,361 --> 00:27:49,194
them were published in any of the 
newspapers and there was no state other 

562
00:27:53,251 --> 00:27:57,570
than New York where they were all 
published besides which in New York.

563
00:27:57,690 --> 00:28:00,750
It was not the federalists that persuade
people to ratify the constitution.

564
00:28:00,751 --> 00:28:02,880
We know that for a fact.
Well,

565
00:28:02,881 --> 00:28:03,714
what happened was that by the time in 
New York came around to considering and 

566
00:28:06,071 --> 00:28:07,830
it okay,
well maybe people don't know,

567
00:28:07,831 --> 00:28:11,580
but the constitution says in article 
seven that the constitution will go into

568
00:28:11,581 --> 00:28:13,590
effect among the ratifying states.

569
00:28:13,770 --> 00:28:16,470
As soon as nine states have ratified,
whether there were 13.

570
00:28:16,471 --> 00:28:18,540
So as soon as two thirds of the states 
have ratified,

571
00:28:18,840 --> 00:28:19,673
and what that meant was that each state 
was supposed to have like a state 

572
00:28:22,951 --> 00:28:23,784
legislative election,
except it would be an election just for 

573
00:28:25,501 --> 00:28:28,980
delegates to this convention that would 
decide one question.

574
00:28:29,010 --> 00:28:31,380
Do we agree yes or no to the 
constitution?

575
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:35,820
So by the time New York,
uh,

576
00:28:35,850 --> 00:28:37,550
met,
um,

577
00:28:37,620 --> 00:28:39,180
oh,
there were already there.

578
00:28:39,181 --> 00:28:42,120
We're already a eight states that 
ratified the constitution.

579
00:28:42,121 --> 00:28:44,340
Then Wild New York convention was 
meeting New Hampshire.

580
00:28:44,341 --> 00:28:46,440
Ratified that made nine in Virginia.
Did that,

581
00:28:46,441 --> 00:28:51,441
made 10 New York was going to be 11th.
Then when they had their election in New

582
00:28:51,510 --> 00:28:53,970
York state for delegates to the 
ratification convention,

583
00:28:53,971 --> 00:28:54,804
two thirds of them were people who had 
promised a vote for me and I'll vote no 

584
00:28:59,070 --> 00:29:02,100
in the convention.
But when they had the convention,

585
00:29:02,420 --> 00:29:03,253
um,
they got word while they're out at that 

586
00:29:04,671 --> 00:29:06,240
New Hampshire had agreed that made nine.

587
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:07,073
So now it's going to go into effect.
Then they heard Virginia had that made 

588
00:29:09,211 --> 00:29:10,044
10.
Now it's really going to go into effect 

589
00:29:10,921 --> 00:29:12,750
because George Washington can be the 
president.

590
00:29:12,780 --> 00:29:15,870
Right?
And so that leaves us North Carolina and

591
00:29:15,871 --> 00:29:16,770
Rhode Island.
Well,

592
00:29:17,370 --> 00:29:18,203
if we stay out,
we're going to have an independent 

593
00:29:19,021 --> 00:29:20,580
country of New York,
North Carolina,

594
00:29:20,581 --> 00:29:21,414
Rhode Island,
and then the federalists from New York 

595
00:29:23,670 --> 00:29:27,840
City had a newspaper published an 
article that said in case New York votes

596
00:29:27,841 --> 00:29:30,570
no on ratification,
New York City will succeed from New York

597
00:29:30,571 --> 00:29:31,404
state and joined the Union as a state.
So then you'd have the independent 

598
00:29:34,021 --> 00:29:38,280
country of upstate New York.
And at that point the one of the leading

599
00:29:38,281 --> 00:29:41,070
anti federalists and the convention made
a speech in which he said,

600
00:29:41,240 --> 00:29:42,010
we don't have a choice.

601
00:29:42,010 --> 00:29:43,120
Now we have to vote.
Yes.

602
00:29:43,270 --> 00:29:46,240
So notice I didn't mention the 
federalist and this whole discussion,

603
00:29:46,300 --> 00:29:47,830
right.
Had nothing to do with it.

604
00:29:47,890 --> 00:29:51,610
That's really fascinating.
Because I was going to ask you at before

605
00:29:51,611 --> 00:29:53,680
you started answering,
I was gonna ask you well with the states

606
00:29:53,681 --> 00:29:56,050
that had said no,
would they have had any recourse.

607
00:29:56,051 --> 00:29:58,040
But basically you're saying their own.
Yeah.

608
00:29:58,720 --> 00:29:59,553
Actually by the time George Washington 
was inaugurated president in April of 

609
00:30:02,681 --> 00:30:03,610
17,
89,

610
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,400
there were 11 states that are read by 
the constitution.

611
00:30:06,610 --> 00:30:07,443
So there were 22 senators that are 11 
states represented in the House of 

612
00:30:09,851 --> 00:30:10,684
Representatives.
Two of the 13 states were independent 

613
00:30:12,461 --> 00:30:15,070
countries,
North Carolina and Rhode Island,

614
00:30:16,060 --> 00:30:18,340
and they were treated as independent 
countries.

615
00:30:18,730 --> 00:30:20,860
And eventually they talked in Congress 
about.

616
00:30:20,861 --> 00:30:21,970
The question was,
well,

617
00:30:21,971 --> 00:30:24,250
what should we do about the fact that 
Rhode Island won't join the Union?

618
00:30:24,251 --> 00:30:25,084
Maybe we should cut off trade with Rhode
Island and make it a little little dot 

619
00:30:27,641 --> 00:30:29,700
on North American map that doesn't have 
fridge.

620
00:30:29,820 --> 00:30:30,491
Yeah.
At any way.

621
00:30:30,491 --> 00:30:31,540
Finally,
because,

622
00:30:31,541 --> 00:30:32,440
well,
what else are we going to do?

623
00:30:32,441 --> 00:30:33,274
Rhode Island agreed to the constitution,
but when they first had their election 

624
00:30:36,311 --> 00:30:39,910
in Rhode Island about instead of having 
an election for ratification convention,

625
00:30:39,970 --> 00:30:41,740
as soon as the Philadelphia convention 
ended and said,

626
00:30:41,741 --> 00:30:42,574
okay,
here you need to ratify the 

627
00:30:43,301 --> 00:30:44,800
constitution,
become a member of the union.

628
00:30:46,120 --> 00:30:50,650
Rhode Island had a referendum on should 
we have an election for a convention?

629
00:30:51,280 --> 00:30:53,320
And they voted like 90 percent.
No,

630
00:30:53,380 --> 00:30:55,180
we don't even want to vote on whether to
vote.

631
00:30:55,181 --> 00:30:56,550
No,
we just know.

632
00:30:56,600 --> 00:30:57,433
Wow.
And so when they finally got around to 

633
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:00,820
having a,
um,

634
00:31:01,270 --> 00:31:04,390
most people were overwhelmingly opposed 
to it,

635
00:31:04,630 --> 00:31:07,030
but they finally ended up agreeing to it
because what else are we going to do?

636
00:31:07,031 --> 00:31:07,864
The other 12 states are already in the 
United States and besides that are 

637
00:31:10,331 --> 00:31:11,164
staying out means they're talking about 
things like creating the judicial 

638
00:31:13,751 --> 00:31:15,970
system,
recommending a bill of rights.

639
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:16,833
Rhode Island's got no congressman,
they're not participating in any of 

640
00:31:19,391 --> 00:31:20,224
this.
They're going to end up in the union 

641
00:31:20,741 --> 00:31:22,420
anyway.
So they finally joined.

642
00:31:23,010 --> 00:31:23,843
Again,
this has nothing to do with the 

643
00:31:24,401 --> 00:31:28,120
federalist papers.
I still want to get great version of the

644
00:31:28,121 --> 00:31:28,954
federalist papers.
But what have been the argument for 

645
00:31:30,041 --> 00:31:31,650
people saying no at that point?
I guess,

646
00:31:32,520 --> 00:31:33,640
I mean,
in Rhode Island.

647
00:31:33,700 --> 00:31:34,533
Yeah.
Well,

648
00:31:34,600 --> 00:31:36,070
um,
during the,

649
00:31:36,170 --> 00:31:37,720
uh,
this is gonna be hard for people who are

650
00:31:37,721 --> 00:31:40,660
listening to understand,
but in the 18th century,

651
00:31:40,661 --> 00:31:41,494
if you said money,
like when I say money and you think of 

652
00:31:43,061 --> 00:31:44,140
an image in your mind,
money,

653
00:31:44,540 --> 00:31:46,130
uh,
that's not what they thought of.

654
00:31:46,250 --> 00:31:48,550
I thought of gold and silver coins,
right?

655
00:31:48,670 --> 00:31:49,503
What that's called Specie.
And what they had begun to do in Rhode 

656
00:31:53,470 --> 00:31:56,500
Island was print notes Bay,
what were called bank notes.

657
00:31:56,501 --> 00:31:59,560
We get paper money and a printing.

658
00:31:59,560 --> 00:32:02,410
This notes is just a way to inflate your
way out of debt.

659
00:32:02,800 --> 00:32:03,633
And so there were a lot of debtors in 
Rhode Island who liked this printing 

660
00:32:06,431 --> 00:32:07,264
money and getting them out of debt.
So they just kept voting for people in 

661
00:32:09,581 --> 00:32:11,170
the legislature who would do this?
Well,

662
00:32:11,171 --> 00:32:12,004
the constitution said that a state could
not make anything but gold or silver 

663
00:32:16,660 --> 00:32:18,340
currency.
So in other words,

664
00:32:18,341 --> 00:32:20,110
if you joined the union,
you can't keep printing money.

665
00:32:20,540 --> 00:32:24,520
Rhode Island had this paper money party 
that was not going to agree to this.

666
00:32:24,940 --> 00:32:27,190
Yeah,
that's why they put it off forever.

667
00:32:27,490 --> 00:32:28,323
Interesting.

668
00:32:30,050 --> 00:32:33,130
90 17.
90 was when they joined the union.

669
00:32:33,250 --> 00:32:34,083
Yeah,
it's over a year after Washington was 

670
00:32:35,531 --> 00:32:37,190
inaugurated.
Alright.

671
00:32:37,210 --> 00:32:40,250
So I want to do the eighth grade version
has of the federalist papers.

672
00:32:41,700 --> 00:32:43,640
That's why I want to circle back there 
for a second.

673
00:32:43,641 --> 00:32:45,230
Okay.
That's really fascinating.

674
00:32:45,231 --> 00:32:48,050
And I don't think most people know that,
that they didn't have the influence that

675
00:32:48,051 --> 00:32:52,460
we now believe them to have.
So for the eighth grade version of this,

676
00:32:52,910 --> 00:32:53,743
really,
he was just trying to get people on 

677
00:32:55,011 --> 00:32:57,450
board signing the constitution.
That was,

678
00:32:57,460 --> 00:33:00,800
that was the general idea.
But what actually was in there,

679
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:04,850
was it a real sales pitch?
People that just really don't know.

680
00:33:04,851 --> 00:33:06,290
Okay.
What's a know about the federal?

681
00:33:06,291 --> 00:33:08,690
Actually the people who you keep saying 
the federalist papers,

682
00:33:08,691 --> 00:33:10,970
and I keep seeing the federalists,
the term,

683
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:11,833
the title,
the federalists papers was not given to 

684
00:33:14,301 --> 00:33:16,490
this document until 1961.

685
00:33:17,540 --> 00:33:20,840
Originally it was just called the 
federalists author was Publius,

686
00:33:20,900 --> 00:33:25,280
which was a pseudonym for John Jay.
James Madison and Alexander Hamilton.

687
00:33:25,810 --> 00:33:27,650
Um,
they wrote different essays.

688
00:33:27,750 --> 00:33:30,730
There are two or three where we think 
probably Hamilton cooperative.

689
00:33:30,940 --> 00:33:32,090
Yeah.
But anyway,

690
00:33:33,020 --> 00:33:34,850
so that was the only thing that was the 
compilation.

691
00:33:35,620 --> 00:33:39,470
So they put them all together and it's,
it's one series under the pseudonym.

692
00:33:39,870 --> 00:33:42,590
Nobody will not make that error.
But the,

693
00:33:42,591 --> 00:33:43,424
uh,
the purpose of the series was that 

694
00:33:45,770 --> 00:33:49,070
Hamilton lived in New York and he knew,
as I mentioned a few minutes ago,

695
00:33:49,071 --> 00:33:52,010
that they had their election for a 
ratification convention in New York.

696
00:33:52,011 --> 00:33:52,844
And two thirds of the people they 
elected voted no so or promised to vote 

697
00:33:56,181 --> 00:33:58,310
no on the convention.
So what do we do about this?

698
00:33:58,630 --> 00:34:02,360
I'm at the Philadelphia Convention.
Hamilton had been one of three delegates

699
00:34:02,361 --> 00:34:04,640
from New York.
The other two left.

700
00:34:04,641 --> 00:34:05,474
After a few weeks they gave speeches in 
which they explained we were sent here 

701
00:34:08,181 --> 00:34:10,490
to propose amendments to the articles of
confederation,

702
00:34:10,491 --> 00:34:11,630
not create a new government.

703
00:34:11,970 --> 00:34:14,540
One of the two who left was the chief 
justice of New York.

704
00:34:14,840 --> 00:34:15,673
And when they got home to New York,
the governor of New York was entirely 

705
00:34:18,201 --> 00:34:19,040
against this.
Right?

706
00:34:19,041 --> 00:34:19,874
He agreed with them entirely.
We're not going to have a new 

707
00:34:20,901 --> 00:34:22,700
constitution.
We don't want any of this stuff.

708
00:34:22,701 --> 00:34:24,950
We don't want to transfer a lot of 
authority out of New York.

709
00:34:25,430 --> 00:34:27,290
And so no,
we're against it.

710
00:34:27,291 --> 00:34:30,800
So Hamilton knew that most people in New
York,

711
00:34:30,801 --> 00:34:35,000
political establishment didn't like it.
They had elections voted against it.

712
00:34:35,030 --> 00:34:36,000
What are we going to do?
Well,

713
00:34:36,200 --> 00:34:37,033
maybe I could go directly to the people.
So his idea was to have a series of 

714
00:34:40,281 --> 00:34:43,340
newspaper essays maybe to get voters to 
change their minds.

715
00:34:43,341 --> 00:34:45,860
I'm not going to persuade the governor 
or the chief justice.

716
00:34:45,880 --> 00:34:46,713
They're both definitely set,
but maybe through a newspaper series we 

717
00:34:50,691 --> 00:34:53,600
could get people to change their minds.
So it's kind of interesting.

718
00:34:53,600 --> 00:34:55,070
He,
he went to a friend of his name,

719
00:34:55,071 --> 00:34:55,904
Gouverneur Morris,
the guy who actually wrote the 

720
00:34:56,841 --> 00:35:00,200
constitution.
So if you think of the expression,

721
00:35:00,500 --> 00:35:01,333
the actual constitution,
you see that fancy Henry Gouverneur 

722
00:35:03,770 --> 00:35:04,311
Morris,
his handwriting.

723
00:35:04,311 --> 00:35:06,950
He was one of the delegates from New 
York and Philadelphia Convention,

724
00:35:06,980 --> 00:35:08,810
I mean from Pennsylvania in the 
Philadelphia Convention,

725
00:35:09,060 --> 00:35:13,160
and he wrote the constitution.
Hamilton asked Morris,

726
00:35:13,161 --> 00:35:13,994
will you please help me write this 
series of essays for the papers to 

727
00:35:17,451 --> 00:35:19,460
persuade New Yorkers is part of the 
constitution.

728
00:35:19,461 --> 00:35:21,830
And Morris said not,
don't write for newspapers.

729
00:35:22,580 --> 00:35:23,413
So then he went to another friend of his
former congressman named William durer 

730
00:35:26,780 --> 00:35:28,580
and he said,
would you please write some essays?

731
00:35:28,820 --> 00:35:32,300
So Dora wrote three essays that were 
going to be in this series in Hamilton,

732
00:35:32,301 --> 00:35:34,430
read them and said,
now these aren't good enough.

733
00:35:34,670 --> 00:35:36,890
So dual,
republished them as a separate pamphlet.

734
00:35:37,380 --> 00:35:39,240
And then he talked to John.
Jay.

735
00:35:39,241 --> 00:35:42,720
John Jay was actually probably the most 
famous New Yorker at the time,

736
00:35:42,721 --> 00:35:43,501
and Jay said,
yes,

737
00:35:43,501 --> 00:35:44,334
I'll do it.

738
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:48,120
But after he wrote a couple of them,
he got extremely sick.

739
00:35:48,150 --> 00:35:48,983
He was bedridden for weeks,
and so he ended up writing only five of 

740
00:35:51,811 --> 00:35:55,260
the 85 essays.
So now Hamilton's now what?

741
00:35:55,470 --> 00:35:57,210
And it turned out that this,
this,

742
00:35:57,300 --> 00:36:00,930
a Virginian congressman who had been in 
the Philadelphia convention,

743
00:36:00,931 --> 00:36:04,290
Madison was back in New York City where 
Congress was meeting.

744
00:36:04,291 --> 00:36:06,960
He was a member of Congress too.
And he asked Madison,

745
00:36:06,961 --> 00:36:08,910
will you help me write these for the 
newspapers?

746
00:36:08,920 --> 00:36:10,950
I got to do something in Madison,
said,

747
00:36:10,951 --> 00:36:11,784
sure,
I'll do it.

748
00:36:11,940 --> 00:36:12,773
So that's why Madison ends up being kind
of second most important author of the 

749
00:36:16,081 --> 00:36:17,290
series.
Um,

750
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,730
the thing about the series is in my book
on Madison,

751
00:36:20,940 --> 00:36:21,773
James Madison and making America,
I devote a lot of space to the 

752
00:36:24,181 --> 00:36:25,014
federalist,
not because it was important at the 

753
00:36:26,041 --> 00:36:27,480
time,
but for two reasons.

754
00:36:27,481 --> 00:36:28,920
One,
it's important now.

755
00:36:29,100 --> 00:36:31,650
People tend to,
even people in Congress,

756
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:34,170
the presidents of people who are on 
federal courts,

757
00:36:34,380 --> 00:36:36,750
they tend to start to answer the 
question,

758
00:36:37,620 --> 00:36:39,270
how do you understand the constitution 
by saying,

759
00:36:39,271 --> 00:36:41,340
well,
here's what federalist 48 says.

760
00:36:41,430 --> 00:36:42,810
You know,
so that's one thing,

761
00:36:43,020 --> 00:36:47,490
but another thing is that this is one of
the most important things Madison did.

762
00:36:47,700 --> 00:36:48,533
Even if he,
even if no one had read them their 

763
00:36:49,861 --> 00:36:51,530
brilliance.
So you know,

764
00:36:51,540 --> 00:36:52,373
if you have a painter,
you writing a book about a painter and 

765
00:36:54,331 --> 00:36:57,930
he made a brilliant painting and nobody 
saw it until last week.

766
00:36:58,580 --> 00:37:01,170
You'd have a chapter on it because it's 
important.

767
00:37:01,171 --> 00:37:02,004
It's an interesting part of his life.
So I think the fact that Madison was as 

768
00:37:04,591 --> 00:37:09,440
brilliant political scientists sheds 
light on the rest of his career.

769
00:37:09,441 --> 00:37:10,274
He had an extremely important political 
career besides his career in the short 

770
00:37:13,801 --> 00:37:14,634
lived career as a political scientist.
So that's why I paid them a lot of 

771
00:37:18,061 --> 00:37:20,010
attention.
But the point is,

772
00:37:20,130 --> 00:37:22,200
and I said before,
I wrote this book about Madison,

773
00:37:22,201 --> 00:37:23,034
partly because we thought is his 
significance has been exaggerated in 

774
00:37:26,290 --> 00:37:28,860
several ways.
One is the federalists didn't,

775
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:31,550
didn't sell the constitution actually in
the play Hamilton,

776
00:37:31,560 --> 00:37:32,730
fascinating.
And the play Hamilton,

777
00:37:32,731 --> 00:37:33,780
there's a song,
but you know,

778
00:37:33,781 --> 00:37:35,370
you sold it,
you wrote it,

779
00:37:35,371 --> 00:37:38,340
and all this stuff about Hamilton,
which is also totally exaggerated.

780
00:37:38,520 --> 00:37:40,890
Uh,
but the same thing goes for Hamilton,

781
00:37:40,891 --> 00:37:42,330
you know,
the same series.

782
00:37:42,331 --> 00:37:43,620
It didn't,
it didn't sell it.

783
00:37:44,130 --> 00:37:44,963
It's not true.
They didn't make people ratify the 

784
00:37:46,951 --> 00:37:48,210
constitution,
the two of them.

785
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:51,060
All right,
well now that you've changed the lore of

786
00:37:51,061 --> 00:37:51,894
the federalist or the federalist papers,
depending on what year we're talking 

787
00:37:55,350 --> 00:37:56,610
that we're referencing them,
right?

788
00:37:56,750 --> 00:37:58,530
Let's talk about some of the other 
things that he drafted.

789
00:37:58,531 --> 00:38:02,490
So he actually did draft the 
constitution and the bill of rights.

790
00:38:02,940 --> 00:38:03,773
I think people are very confused what 
that actually means or how many people 

791
00:38:06,901 --> 00:38:07,734
actually did this together,
where they all sitting in a room where 

792
00:38:09,961 --> 00:38:14,040
they mailing pieces back and forth.
Were they sending edits to people?

793
00:38:14,041 --> 00:38:16,260
How did the whole process actually go?

794
00:38:16,710 --> 00:38:17,730
Oh,
well,

795
00:38:17,731 --> 00:38:19,750
you mean you want to start with us 
constantly.

796
00:38:19,751 --> 00:38:21,030
Let's start with the constitution.
Okay.

797
00:38:21,031 --> 00:38:25,470
So Madison is often called the father of
the constitution.

798
00:38:26,040 --> 00:38:28,650
I think this is exaggerated.
So did he,

799
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:29,633
in his own lifetime,
people gave him accolades like that and 

800
00:38:32,101 --> 00:38:33,720
he would always reject them.
In fact,

801
00:38:33,721 --> 00:38:35,690
at one point he said the,
uh,

802
00:38:36,020 --> 00:38:39,730
the constitution was the work of many 
hands heads and many hands.

803
00:38:40,210 --> 00:38:41,043
And what he meant by that was that the 
constitution was largely unlike what he 

804
00:38:44,261 --> 00:38:46,150
had proposed.
So,

805
00:38:46,570 --> 00:38:49,660
uh,
essentially he had an idea and he wasn't

806
00:38:49,661 --> 00:38:51,790
the only one.
He was part of a movement in 17,

807
00:38:51,791 --> 00:38:54,040
seventies and eighties called the 
federalists movement,

808
00:38:54,460 --> 00:38:55,293
which is kind of confusing because we 
have different groups in American 

809
00:38:57,161 --> 00:38:59,950
history are called federalists.
There's going to be a federalist party,

810
00:39:00,160 --> 00:39:03,940
not the same people.
Who were the federalists who were behind

811
00:39:04,210 --> 00:39:05,550
creating the US Constitution.

812
00:39:05,620 --> 00:39:07,420
Who were that?
Were those original?

813
00:39:07,720 --> 00:39:08,261
Well,
the,

814
00:39:08,261 --> 00:39:09,460
these.
Okay.

815
00:39:09,490 --> 00:39:13,630
The Labor Party is the one that congeals
around Alexander Hamilton in 17 counties

816
00:39:14,050 --> 00:39:15,220
over his,
uh,

817
00:39:15,610 --> 00:39:17,650
his platform,
his program,

818
00:39:17,651 --> 00:39:19,870
his treasury secretary in the Washington
ministration.

819
00:39:19,871 --> 00:39:20,704
But before that,
there had been people who wanted to 

820
00:39:22,331 --> 00:39:25,330
strengthen the central government in 17,
seventies and the eighties.

821
00:39:25,331 --> 00:39:29,620
They're called federalists too.
You have Hamilton,

822
00:39:29,620 --> 00:39:30,453
Madison,
uh,

823
00:39:30,700 --> 00:39:33,970
Richard Morris,
who is the chief financial expert in the

824
00:39:33,971 --> 00:39:34,804
continental congress in the Secretary 
for finance of the Confederation 

825
00:39:38,440 --> 00:39:39,910
Congress,
the guy who has to pay for the war,

826
00:39:39,911 --> 00:39:42,850
basically a general Washington was a 
federalist.

827
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:45,970
Various other people,
generally people who were federalists in

828
00:39:45,971 --> 00:39:46,804
this first sentence.
People who want to strengthen the 

829
00:39:47,891 --> 00:39:48,900
central government,
17,

830
00:39:48,920 --> 00:39:52,120
seventies and eighties had either been 
in Congress or they had been officers in

831
00:39:52,121 --> 00:39:54,910
the military or some of them had been 
diplomats.

832
00:39:55,030 --> 00:39:57,220
So they saw that during the revolution 
we,

833
00:39:57,221 --> 00:40:00,760
I literally had American soldiers who 
starved to death in the field,

834
00:40:00,860 --> 00:40:03,940
went into battle literally without 
muskets who,

835
00:40:03,990 --> 00:40:05,200
uh,
in the winter,

836
00:40:05,201 --> 00:40:09,220
didn't have boots and their feet broken,
bled a,

837
00:40:09,221 --> 00:40:10,480
they didn't have blankets.

838
00:40:10,670 --> 00:40:11,503
Um,
there were people who were diplomats 

839
00:40:12,731 --> 00:40:16,090
like John Jay and Thomas Jefferson who 
went overseas and John Jay,

840
00:40:16,091 --> 00:40:16,924
for example,
in the seventies and eighties when he 

841
00:40:18,341 --> 00:40:21,220
was American minister to Spain,
showed up in Spain.

842
00:40:21,221 --> 00:40:24,370
And the first thing he had to ask the 
foreign ministers assistant was,

843
00:40:24,640 --> 00:40:26,950
can you loan me some money so I can buy 
some food?

844
00:40:27,010 --> 00:40:28,510
Wow,
I need to borrow money.

845
00:40:28,511 --> 00:40:31,320
So I can get myself a place to sleep.
Um,

846
00:40:31,600 --> 00:40:34,210
so in other words,
the federal government had no money.

847
00:40:34,211 --> 00:40:35,800
I couldn't do anything.
And it also,

848
00:40:35,801 --> 00:40:39,490
during the revolution it had not only 
did it have to ask Congress for money to

849
00:40:39,491 --> 00:40:40,930
pay for things,
but it had to ask,

850
00:40:40,990 --> 00:40:42,790
I'm sorry,
did it have to ask the states to pay for

851
00:40:42,791 --> 00:40:43,660
things?
But the,

852
00:40:43,720 --> 00:40:48,720
the congress had to ask the states for 
men and always they got less.

853
00:40:49,480 --> 00:40:51,190
They have less money than they had asked
for.

854
00:40:51,340 --> 00:40:53,470
They had less,
fewer men than they had asked for.

855
00:40:54,370 --> 00:40:57,250
And there were some times when states 
said,

856
00:40:57,251 --> 00:40:58,450
no,
we're not sending anything.

857
00:40:58,660 --> 00:41:02,170
So by the time the Philadelphia 
convention met in 17,

858
00:41:02,171 --> 00:41:03,004
87,
every single state had sometimes sent 

859
00:41:05,831 --> 00:41:09,520
less than requested.
Some of them had sent nothing in some in

860
00:41:09,521 --> 00:41:12,040
response to some of these requests from 
men or money.

861
00:41:12,370 --> 00:41:14,990
And was there a punishment?
What can we do?

862
00:41:15,120 --> 00:41:17,590
There was no as if,
as if today,

863
00:41:17,591 --> 00:41:18,424
for example,
we have this situation of president 

864
00:41:19,931 --> 00:41:20,764
trump made famous in 2016 campaign in 
which we have 27 members of NATO and 

865
00:41:24,461 --> 00:41:27,730
only five of them meet the two percent 
of GDP threshold of,

866
00:41:28,090 --> 00:41:28,780
of,
uh,

867
00:41:28,780 --> 00:41:29,613
military spending that they have all 
committed to what can the other 22 of 

868
00:41:33,410 --> 00:41:35,150
including the Americans who pay more 
than anybody,

869
00:41:35,330 --> 00:41:36,163
what can the rest of us do to Germany or
the Netherlands or Spain for not 

870
00:41:39,681 --> 00:41:41,400
spending two percent of GDP on the 
military?

871
00:41:41,400 --> 00:41:43,280
And the answer is nothing.
There's nothing we can do.

872
00:41:43,790 --> 00:41:44,623
The same thing was going on and actually
the worst a transgressor in this regard 

873
00:41:47,721 --> 00:41:51,320
was Rhode Island,
which repeatedly sent nothing.

874
00:41:51,840 --> 00:41:52,673
And these guys were the real rebels.
They were scofflaws and actually they 

875
00:41:55,281 --> 00:41:56,114
were going to send,
they were the only state that didn't 

876
00:41:57,231 --> 00:41:58,064
send anybody to the Philadelphia 
convention because they didn't want to 

877
00:41:59,991 --> 00:42:01,670
strengthen it.
We're not paying.

878
00:42:01,671 --> 00:42:04,070
Why should we want a straight from that?
That would mean we'd have to pay.

879
00:42:04,210 --> 00:42:05,140
And they actually,
there were,

880
00:42:05,420 --> 00:42:08,960
what economists call a free rider.
They realized that if Massachusetts,

881
00:42:08,961 --> 00:42:09,890
Pennsylvania,
Virginia,

882
00:42:09,891 --> 00:42:10,724
we're going to defend themselves,
they're going to be defending Rhode 

883
00:42:12,590 --> 00:42:13,840
Island.
Yeah,

884
00:42:13,910 --> 00:42:15,930
so why should we pay for this?
So anyways,

885
00:42:15,931 --> 00:42:20,660
so people like Washington who had been 
commander and chief of the army and seen

886
00:42:20,661 --> 00:42:21,494
his men in these dire straits in the 
field and Madison who had been in 

887
00:42:23,691 --> 00:42:26,270
Congress and tried to get money to,
you know,

888
00:42:26,271 --> 00:42:29,960
to send to Washington or men,
they realize this is inadequate.

889
00:42:30,040 --> 00:42:30,873
We have to have something else.
So Madison drafted what's called the 

890
00:42:33,471 --> 00:42:34,304
Virginia plan,
which envisioned a new national 

891
00:42:37,251 --> 00:42:39,620
government,
unlike the one we have now,

892
00:42:39,680 --> 00:42:42,470
unlike the one that was created by this 
process.

893
00:42:42,680 --> 00:42:45,560
So people credit him with having written
the constitution.

894
00:42:45,830 --> 00:42:48,500
He wrote a rough draft that you could 
say,

895
00:42:48,560 --> 00:42:49,393
you know,
a couple of major features were made 

896
00:42:51,441 --> 00:42:52,274
part of a new constitution,
but many of the major features were 

897
00:42:54,591 --> 00:42:55,424
rejected over and over in.
Some of them met after he repeatedly 

898
00:42:58,431 --> 00:42:59,570
brought them up again.
And again,

899
00:42:59,750 --> 00:43:01,640
when they get to the last week of the 
Philadelphia Convention,

900
00:43:01,641 --> 00:43:02,474
they voted on and one of his major pet 
ideas and every single state including 

901
00:43:05,841 --> 00:43:06,674
Virginia voted no.
So he was not the author of the 

902
00:43:08,961 --> 00:43:10,190
Constitution.
It's not,

903
00:43:10,220 --> 00:43:13,010
it's not true.
He played a very important role,

904
00:43:13,011 --> 00:43:13,844
which should be remembered,
but I don't think it makes them look 

905
00:43:15,801 --> 00:43:18,470
better to make up something that he 
didn't actually do.

906
00:43:18,530 --> 00:43:19,341
So,
so interesting.

907
00:43:19,341 --> 00:43:20,960
So this,
this group of federalist,

908
00:43:20,961 --> 00:43:24,200
at the time they were really trying to 
strengthen the federal government.

909
00:43:24,201 --> 00:43:26,750
It sounds like it really was mostly for 
military purposes.

910
00:43:26,751 --> 00:43:29,900
I mean you mentioned the main function 
for some overseas post.

911
00:43:30,490 --> 00:43:32,710
Well you had to have diplomats.
If you're going to have a military,

912
00:43:32,711 --> 00:43:35,300
you want to have diplomats overseas.
Mainly what the diplomats were doing was

913
00:43:35,301 --> 00:43:37,850
trying to get alliances to help fight 
the war,

914
00:43:38,180 --> 00:43:40,730
to get foreign countries to loan the 
United States money.

915
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:44,630
So it was all one cause essentially it 
was about foreign policy.

916
00:43:44,631 --> 00:43:46,250
That's what the federal government was 
for.

917
00:43:46,730 --> 00:43:48,650
This is classic federal government,
you know,

918
00:43:48,651 --> 00:43:51,470
where you have some countries that can't
defend themselves,

919
00:43:51,471 --> 00:43:54,080
and so they leave together for mutual 
defense.

920
00:43:54,170 --> 00:43:55,700
Yeah.
So,

921
00:43:55,701 --> 00:43:56,534
all right,
so if he wasn't the author of the 

922
00:43:57,951 --> 00:44:02,480
Constitution in the way that we think,
what were the contributions that we need

923
00:44:02,481 --> 00:44:03,314
to know about?

924
00:44:03,590 --> 00:44:04,423
Well,
first he was one of the main people 

925
00:44:06,471 --> 00:44:08,900
behind the fact that there was a 
Philadelphia convention.

926
00:44:09,170 --> 00:44:10,003
So if there ended up being this meeting 
have delegates from 12 states to talk 

927
00:44:13,641 --> 00:44:16,940
about amending the articles of 
confederation so that the congress would

928
00:44:16,941 --> 00:44:19,070
be able to raise men and money to,
you know,

929
00:44:19,280 --> 00:44:20,113
send diplomats and raise an army.
Madison was one of the two or three 

930
00:44:23,541 --> 00:44:26,390
people most responsible for there being 
a Philadelphia convention.

931
00:44:26,860 --> 00:44:27,693
And then when they got to Philadelphia,
he persuaded the other Virginia 

932
00:44:29,961 --> 00:44:33,240
delegates who included some of the most 
prominent men in the country,

933
00:44:33,560 --> 00:44:34,393
uh,
to propose what's called the Virginia 

934
00:44:36,391 --> 00:44:37,224
plan,
which laid out that there should be 

935
00:44:39,270 --> 00:44:41,400
three branches of the federal 
government,

936
00:44:41,430 --> 00:44:44,020
that the legislature should be by 
cameras.

937
00:44:44,100 --> 00:44:48,120
It should have a taxing power.
These are very important ideas.

938
00:44:48,530 --> 00:44:50,960
These are all the ideas that ultimately 
made it into,

939
00:44:51,060 --> 00:44:54,290
these are some ideas that ultimately 
made it into the constitution at all.

940
00:44:55,470 --> 00:44:58,110
These are important ideas that made it 
in the constitution,

941
00:44:58,111 --> 00:44:58,980
but.
But again,

942
00:44:58,981 --> 00:44:59,814
if we had time,
I could go through many other ideas of 

943
00:45:01,321 --> 00:45:03,870
Madison proposed that were rejected.
In fact,

944
00:45:03,871 --> 00:45:04,810
one of them.
Yeah.

945
00:45:04,870 --> 00:45:06,470
Give me.
Give me one.

946
00:45:06,580 --> 00:45:07,413
One example is madison proposed that 
there should be three branches of a new 

947
00:45:11,641 --> 00:45:12,474
national government.
It should have a national legislature 

948
00:45:14,141 --> 00:45:16,050
and national executive under national 
judiciary.

949
00:45:16,051 --> 00:45:18,200
The national legislature should be by 
camera.

950
00:45:18,201 --> 00:45:19,034
Okay.
So far this sounds like the US 

951
00:45:19,621 --> 00:45:20,750
constitution so far.
I'm with you.

952
00:45:20,760 --> 00:45:21,593
Okay,
so the lower house shall be elected by 

953
00:45:22,381 --> 00:45:23,214
the people.
The upper house shall be elected by the 

954
00:45:24,631 --> 00:45:25,464
lower house.
Both houses should be apportioned by 

955
00:45:27,391 --> 00:45:28,224
population.
The congress should have a veto overall 

956
00:45:30,300 --> 00:45:31,133
state laws that Congress should be able 
to to legislate about anything they 

957
00:45:33,721 --> 00:45:36,900
wanted.
About half of what I just said is not in

958
00:45:36,901 --> 00:45:40,200
the constitution,
including the veto overall state laws.

959
00:45:40,200 --> 00:45:42,930
Madison said was his favorite proposal 
really,

960
00:45:42,931 --> 00:45:43,764
and it sounds so counter.
He thought it was essential for the 

961
00:45:46,801 --> 00:45:49,500
central government to be able to say,
if Rhode Island,

962
00:45:49,740 --> 00:45:51,660
uh,
wants to print paper money,

963
00:45:51,750 --> 00:45:54,570
no veto,
you can't print paper money.

964
00:45:54,750 --> 00:45:57,540
So that was one thing.
So this must've been one of those points

965
00:45:57,541 --> 00:45:59,220
that he and Jefferson had a major 
difference,

966
00:45:59,221 --> 00:45:59,821
right?
Well,

967
00:45:59,821 --> 00:46:02,430
Jefferson was in France while the 
constitution was being written,

968
00:46:02,580 --> 00:46:05,260
so he only saw it afterward.
He couldn't have been thrilled.

969
00:46:05,620 --> 00:46:06,453
Actually.
This is kind of funny because it's good 

970
00:46:08,731 --> 00:46:13,731
that you asked me this because when,
when Jefferson received the constitution

971
00:46:14,281 --> 00:46:15,114
first,
the Philadelphia convention ends on 

972
00:46:16,141 --> 00:46:17,370
September 17,
17,

973
00:46:17,371 --> 00:46:18,204
87.
And you have 11 states signed the 

974
00:46:21,241 --> 00:46:23,640
constitution.
Rhode Island never showed up,

975
00:46:23,641 --> 00:46:24,474
so they didn't.
New York couldn't sign because two of 

976
00:46:26,281 --> 00:46:28,710
their three delegates had left.
So Hamilton signed it,

977
00:46:28,711 --> 00:46:29,544
but he didn't.
He couldn't vote Yes for New York 

978
00:46:31,021 --> 00:46:32,610
because he was only one of three 
delegates.

979
00:46:32,610 --> 00:46:36,100
So he was not a quorum himself.
So 11 states sign it.

980
00:46:36,420 --> 00:46:37,253
And then Madison waited from September 
17th until October 24th to send 

981
00:46:41,041 --> 00:46:41,874
Jefferson a copy.
Usually two of them are writing each 

982
00:46:43,381 --> 00:46:44,214
other all the time.
He waits a month and a week before he 

983
00:46:46,051 --> 00:46:47,910
sends him a copy.
Why does he wait so long?

984
00:46:48,120 --> 00:46:49,530
Well,
there are two parts of the answer.

985
00:46:49,531 --> 00:46:50,364
One is he's writing a very long letter.
There are hundreds and hundreds of 

986
00:46:53,521 --> 00:46:57,540
surviving letters between the two of 
them over the 50 year friendship.

987
00:46:57,600 --> 00:47:02,400
Very long body of very large body of,
of missives,

988
00:47:02,401 --> 00:47:04,260
back and forth,
but he waited a long time.

989
00:47:04,410 --> 00:47:07,230
One thing he did was he wrote a 
description of the convention,

990
00:47:07,260 --> 00:47:08,093
which is several pages,
but another thing seems to been he 

991
00:47:10,141 --> 00:47:12,540
probably knew that Jefferson wasn't 
going to like this thing,

992
00:47:12,840 --> 00:47:13,673
so Jefferson,
by the time he got Madison's letter 

993
00:47:15,700 --> 00:47:16,533
cover letter in copy of the Constitution
has already received it from someone 

994
00:47:18,481 --> 00:47:20,130
else and then when he read it,
he,

995
00:47:20,190 --> 00:47:22,680
he looked at it and he wrote to his 
friend John Adams,

996
00:47:22,681 --> 00:47:24,240
who in Britain,
Jefferson's and France.

997
00:47:24,360 --> 00:47:25,193
Adams is in Britain.
So Jefferson sends Adam's a letter and 

998
00:47:27,331 --> 00:47:28,164
he says,
I've seen.

999
00:47:28,320 --> 00:47:30,490
Have you seen the product of the 
Philadelphia Convention?

1000
00:47:30,700 --> 00:47:31,470
I own that.
I'm,

1001
00:47:31,470 --> 00:47:32,303
I'm disappointed in the car in this.
I would have expected more from the 

1002
00:47:35,171 --> 00:47:36,910
people who were in the Philadelphia 
Convention.

1003
00:47:36,911 --> 00:47:37,744
I don't know.
I don't know whether it's more good or 

1004
00:47:38,681 --> 00:47:39,900
more bad,
but.

1005
00:47:39,910 --> 00:47:40,743
So that's his original response to it.
And then when he finally gets it from 

1006
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:44,800
Madison he says,
okay,

1007
00:47:45,040 --> 00:47:50,040
I liked bicameralism and I liked that 
Congress has a taxing power and I,

1008
00:47:50,680 --> 00:47:53,680
I liked that there was an independent 
executive and you have a judiciary,

1009
00:47:53,681 --> 00:47:54,880
but there are a couple of things I don't
like.

1010
00:47:54,881 --> 00:47:57,550
One is perpetual eligibility of the 
president.

1011
00:47:57,551 --> 00:47:58,384
That's terrible idea.
President will be able to make friends 

1012
00:48:00,401 --> 00:48:01,234
all over the country.
He'll be able to hand out contracts and 

1013
00:48:02,591 --> 00:48:05,530
make appointments and pretty soon a 
president will serve for life.

1014
00:48:05,560 --> 00:48:07,660
This is a bad idea.
You should have a term limit.

1015
00:48:08,020 --> 00:48:10,360
He thought.
And the second thing was he says there's

1016
00:48:10,361 --> 00:48:12,850
no bill of rights.
So then he had madison.

1017
00:48:12,851 --> 00:48:15,370
This is one of the other areas where 
they had a serious disagreement.

1018
00:48:15,371 --> 00:48:16,204
They went back and forth over this 
question whether there should be a bill 

1019
00:48:17,831 --> 00:48:20,440
of rights and Madison's answer was,
well,

1020
00:48:20,650 --> 00:48:21,391
okay,
um,

1021
00:48:21,391 --> 00:48:23,440
I like the principles you would include 
in your bill of rights,

1022
00:48:23,441 --> 00:48:24,880
but the thing is,
um,

1023
00:48:24,940 --> 00:48:27,640
I don't think a bill of rights really is
going to bind anybody.

1024
00:48:27,940 --> 00:48:32,940
So over time the government will ignore 
or violate or in some sense,

1025
00:48:33,100 --> 00:48:36,010
practically void the bill of rights.
And what will people learn from that?

1026
00:48:36,040 --> 00:48:36,873
So I think it's better that the people 
should have their insistence on 

1027
00:48:39,671 --> 00:48:40,504
particular rights and when they vote,
they should ensure that their 

1028
00:48:42,821 --> 00:48:44,510
representatives stand for these,
right?

1029
00:48:44,510 --> 00:48:46,270
But if you don't want to put them in the
constitution,

1030
00:48:46,420 --> 00:48:48,520
and Jefferson says,
well,

1031
00:48:48,580 --> 00:48:51,820
okay,
it's true that occasionally that,

1032
00:48:51,880 --> 00:48:52,713
uh,
people who hold office will violate the 

1033
00:48:54,130 --> 00:48:56,020
provisions of bill of rights.
But on the other hand,

1034
00:48:56,560 --> 00:48:58,570
it's something you can point to.
You can say,

1035
00:48:58,690 --> 00:49:00,490
this guy shouldn't be reluctant because 
look,

1036
00:49:00,820 --> 00:49:02,320
fourth amendment,
he violated it.

1037
00:49:02,321 --> 00:49:03,154
He doesn't care about it all you should.
So they went back and forth and Madison 

1038
00:49:05,411 --> 00:49:06,430
says,
well these,

1039
00:49:06,460 --> 00:49:07,293
you know,
in Virginia we have a declaration of 

1040
00:49:08,141 --> 00:49:08,974
rights and it's ignored.
The legislature violates at Madison and 

1041
00:49:10,871 --> 00:49:14,020
Jefferson says that's true,
but you and I are both complaining about

1042
00:49:14,021 --> 00:49:15,850
it and other people complain about it 
too and we,

1043
00:49:16,240 --> 00:49:18,040
you know,
at least we can point to that.

1044
00:49:18,220 --> 00:49:19,840
Besides that,
Jefferson says,

1045
00:49:20,020 --> 00:49:21,850
I think a bill of rights has an 
instructive.

1046
00:49:21,851 --> 00:49:22,684
It's got an educational function.
People maybe they don't think about 

1047
00:49:25,841 --> 00:49:28,630
these kinds of questions and if he 
didn't mention them to them,

1048
00:49:28,780 --> 00:49:29,740
they,
they might.

1049
00:49:30,100 --> 00:49:30,933
They might never come to mind for them.
But if you have a bill of rights 

1050
00:49:33,491 --> 00:49:34,324
listing,
particular rights that people should be 

1051
00:49:35,681 --> 00:49:36,514
able to count on,
then they'll realize that somebody is 

1052
00:49:39,101 --> 00:49:39,934
violating one of their important rights 
and then they'll care when otherwise 

1053
00:49:43,271 --> 00:49:45,070
they would never notice.
So he says,

1054
00:49:45,071 --> 00:49:48,010
I think even if only for that a bill of 
rights was good idea.

1055
00:49:48,190 --> 00:49:49,720
Madison comes back and says,
well,

1056
00:49:49,990 --> 00:49:50,823
yeah,
I think it would take a lot of work and 

1057
00:49:51,701 --> 00:49:52,534
probably people are going to be really 
disappointed if they think that we're 

1058
00:49:55,481 --> 00:49:56,314
going to have to amend the Constitution 
and Jefferson finally you can tell he 

1059
00:49:59,621 --> 00:50:02,350
gets angry,
so at his answer to that is look,

1060
00:50:02,940 --> 00:50:03,773
Bill of rights is what the people are 
entitled to against every government in 

1061
00:50:05,861 --> 00:50:09,790
the world general or particular.
So by this point,

1062
00:50:09,910 --> 00:50:12,220
Madison has already gone to the 
Philadelphia Convention.

1063
00:50:12,400 --> 00:50:14,260
He's worked through the whole 
convention.

1064
00:50:14,440 --> 00:50:15,273
When they got to the end of it,
his friend George Mason and his friend 

1065
00:50:17,531 --> 00:50:19,270
Edmund Randolph,
both from Virginia ones,

1066
00:50:19,271 --> 00:50:20,104
George the George Mason,
the leading constitutional thinker in 

1067
00:50:22,961 --> 00:50:23,794
Virginia and the other one is at Miranda
off the governor of Virginia and former 

1068
00:50:26,840 --> 00:50:29,270
attorney general of Virginia.
They both refused to sign it,

1069
00:50:29,480 --> 00:50:31,070
partly because it didn't have bill of 
rights.

1070
00:50:31,220 --> 00:50:33,850
Now was Thomas Jefferson and 
corresponding with them,

1071
00:50:34,130 --> 00:50:37,100
we don't know.
We don't know that he was in and I think

1072
00:50:37,101 --> 00:50:39,800
if he had been either here they would've
saved letters.

1073
00:50:39,801 --> 00:50:42,200
So I don't think so,
but the thing is.

1074
00:50:42,320 --> 00:50:43,153
But the thing is Jefferson insisting on 
this follows on Mason and randolph 

1075
00:50:46,910 --> 00:50:47,743
insisting on this and refusing to sign,
and you have to kind of imagine madison 

1076
00:50:50,421 --> 00:50:51,290
thinking,
okay,

1077
00:50:51,590 --> 00:50:52,423
I don't think this is that important.
I don't really think it would have that 

1078
00:50:54,441 --> 00:50:55,274
much impact,
but if it's going to mean that Mason 

1079
00:50:57,620 --> 00:50:58,453
Randolph and Jefferson are opposed,
this could mean that we don't get the 

1080
00:51:00,951 --> 00:51:01,790
thing ratified.

1081
00:51:01,940 --> 00:51:04,850
So finally he's going to say,
I agree to this.

1082
00:51:04,970 --> 00:51:05,930
Now,
one,

1083
00:51:05,960 --> 00:51:06,793
one,
one thing you can rightly call Madison 

1084
00:51:09,021 --> 00:51:09,854
is the author of the bill of rights.
But it's interesting to look at the way 

1085
00:51:12,321 --> 00:51:13,154
he introduced this in Congress.
So they go to Congress after he's been 

1086
00:51:15,831 --> 00:51:17,680
elected to Congress on the ground that 
he put,

1087
00:51:17,750 --> 00:51:20,570
he promised he would seek amendments in 
Congress.

1088
00:51:20,810 --> 00:51:22,970
And then when he finally introduces 
these amendments,

1089
00:51:22,971 --> 00:51:24,950
here's how he introduces them.
He says,

1090
00:51:25,520 --> 00:51:27,730
you know,
some men who would otherwise be willed,

1091
00:51:28,010 --> 00:51:28,843
disposed toward our new government are 
opposed to it because it doesn't have a 

1092
00:51:31,131 --> 00:51:31,964
bill of rights.
And that he says this in his speech in 

1093
00:51:33,831 --> 00:51:35,900
Congress and I don't think it can hurt 
anything.

1094
00:51:36,560 --> 00:51:39,190
So why don't we add these,
right?

1095
00:51:39,370 --> 00:51:40,203
So he's not persuaded,
but he thinks it's a good political 

1096
00:51:42,891 --> 00:51:44,900
idea.
So nowadays we think,

1097
00:51:44,990 --> 00:51:46,580
oh,
James Madison gave us,

1098
00:51:46,581 --> 00:51:48,800
you know,
the basis of every lawsuit in America.

1099
00:51:48,830 --> 00:51:49,730
No,
no,

1100
00:51:49,910 --> 00:51:53,060
he grudgingly did this because his 
friends wanted him to.

1101
00:51:53,061 --> 00:51:54,860
And he was afraid they would never agree
to,

1102
00:51:54,890 --> 00:51:57,590
to support the constitution if he didn't
say,

1103
00:51:57,591 --> 00:51:58,730
okay,
we'll have these.

1104
00:51:58,731 --> 00:51:59,564
And he says,
I don't think they're going to hurt 

1105
00:51:59,871 --> 00:52:00,920
anything,
please.

1106
00:52:00,921 --> 00:52:02,000
Let's agree to them.
We'll get,

1107
00:52:02,290 --> 00:52:03,123
you know,
we get people like Randolph and Mason 

1108
00:52:03,831 --> 00:52:07,640
and Jefferson to be enthusiastic.
So basically he was a realist at that.

1109
00:52:07,670 --> 00:52:08,503
He was all the time a realist.
He in Jefferson kind of Yin and Yang 

1110
00:52:11,571 --> 00:52:12,750
right once,
once,

1111
00:52:13,170 --> 00:52:15,020
kind of impractical,
theoretical,

1112
00:52:15,021 --> 00:52:16,940
philosophical.
He's very,

1113
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:17,833
they're both very bookish.
We both know you can name 50 books and 

1114
00:52:21,071 --> 00:52:21,904
political science in Greek and Latin 
into English classics and a couple of 

1115
00:52:24,540 --> 00:52:26,660
freshmen.
They both know every page,

1116
00:52:26,870 --> 00:52:27,703
right?
But they come out of this entirely 

1117
00:52:29,331 --> 00:52:30,164
different and yet they're,
they're just very affectionate friends 

1118
00:52:33,410 --> 00:52:36,230
because they have this common interests 
and they both think,

1119
00:52:36,231 --> 00:52:37,460
well,
we have kind of the same goal.

1120
00:52:37,460 --> 00:52:40,100
We want Americans to be free.
What we want to republic,

1121
00:52:40,101 --> 00:52:42,500
we want stability,
we want prosperity,

1122
00:52:42,501 --> 00:52:44,840
we don't want wars.
They have a lot in common.

1123
00:52:44,841 --> 00:52:47,510
But I hope you've already gotten that.
They're very different.

1124
00:52:47,511 --> 00:52:49,250
Yeah,
well it's fascinating and it's like,

1125
00:52:49,290 --> 00:52:53,150
you know,
241 some odd years later,

1126
00:52:53,870 --> 00:52:56,030
the idea that Jefferson was pushing 
their up.

1127
00:52:56,031 --> 00:52:56,864
We need people to be able to point to 
something and say that's one thing that 

1128
00:52:59,931 --> 00:53:04,460
actually does seem to work the time 
because as everyone watching this knows,

1129
00:53:04,461 --> 00:53:07,970
I mean I'm constantly yammering about 
free speech and the first amendment.

1130
00:53:08,060 --> 00:53:08,893
We know what the First Amendment is.
We know the second amendment is the 

1131
00:53:10,641 --> 00:53:11,474
right to bear arms.
We know the fourth amendment is the 

1132
00:53:12,831 --> 00:53:13,670
right to privacy.
I mean,

1133
00:53:13,790 --> 00:53:14,623
so that point really does seem like it's
something that truly translated over 

1134
00:53:18,600 --> 00:53:21,740
time and that is,
it kind of had to be dragged into it.

1135
00:53:21,740 --> 00:53:23,960
So they had to be completely had to be 
dragged into it.

1136
00:53:23,961 --> 00:53:28,410
In fact,
he also was defeated for election to the

1137
00:53:28,411 --> 00:53:29,244
first US Senate,
partly because of his having resisted 

1138
00:53:33,151 --> 00:53:34,710
having a bill of rights in the 
constitution.

1139
00:53:34,711 --> 00:53:36,660
That's why he ends up in the House of 
Representatives.

1140
00:53:37,140 --> 00:53:40,470
So not only are people in Virginia who 
didn't want a new constitution,

1141
00:53:40,471 --> 00:53:41,304
they didn't like Madison for having this
Philadelphia Convention and the rest of 

1142
00:53:43,591 --> 00:53:44,424
it,
but they also were very skeptical about 

1143
00:53:45,960 --> 00:53:47,940
his willingness to amend the 
constitution.

1144
00:53:47,941 --> 00:53:51,510
So they kept him out of the Senate and 
he ends up being narrowly elected.

1145
00:53:51,530 --> 00:53:53,420
The House of Representatives.
How much

1146
00:53:53,430 --> 00:53:55,680
fighting was there once they said,
okay,

1147
00:53:55,700 --> 00:53:57,990
well once he conceded the point on the 
bill of rights,

1148
00:53:57,991 --> 00:53:58,824
how much writing was there as to what 
actually was going to be in the bill of 

1149
00:54:01,021 --> 00:54:01,710
rights?

1150
00:54:01,710 --> 00:54:04,410
Not a lot.
People weren't really interested because

1151
00:54:04,411 --> 00:54:07,200
the first congress was completely 
dominated by federalists.

1152
00:54:07,530 --> 00:54:08,363
So you have most historians now who've 
spent a lot of attention on the process 

1153
00:54:13,381 --> 00:54:15,630
of creating the constitution.
In ratifying it.

1154
00:54:15,631 --> 00:54:17,880
Think probably most voters didn't want 
it.

1155
00:54:18,600 --> 00:54:19,433
So if we had time to go through it state
by state and kind of talk about how it 

1156
00:54:22,591 --> 00:54:23,424
came to be ratified,
I think I could persuade you that it 

1157
00:54:26,371 --> 00:54:27,204
seems like most American voters did not 
want the constitution it had to do with 

1158
00:54:30,781 --> 00:54:31,614
better tactics on the side of the 
federalists that it ended up being 

1159
00:54:33,781 --> 00:54:35,430
agreed to.
Um,

1160
00:54:37,470 --> 00:54:38,303
so,

1161
00:54:38,980 --> 00:54:40,840
but what,
was there anything that once the bill of

1162
00:54:40,841 --> 00:54:45,220
rights was actually being written that 
Jefferson and Madison or any of them had

1163
00:54:45,420 --> 00:54:46,720
read?
Like this has to be in here,

1164
00:54:46,721 --> 00:54:48,790
but we're not really fighting over any 
of that?

1165
00:54:50,270 --> 00:54:51,103
Well,
several estates that had close 

1166
00:54:53,041 --> 00:54:56,390
ratification contest with their 
announcements.

1167
00:54:56,391 --> 00:54:59,870
We've ratified since proposed 
amendments.

1168
00:55:00,280 --> 00:55:03,700
So at an early point after five states,
okay.

1169
00:55:03,870 --> 00:55:06,050
Philadelphia convention in September 17,
17,

1170
00:55:06,051 --> 00:55:06,884
87,
five states immediately ratified within 

1171
00:55:08,991 --> 00:55:12,560
weeks for them were small states like 
Rhode Island that new.

1172
00:55:12,561 --> 00:55:14,360
This is the sweetest table.
Everyday we're equal.

1173
00:55:14,590 --> 00:55:17,330
We're equal to fill to Virginia and in 
Massachusetts,

1174
00:55:17,331 --> 00:55:18,740
in the Senate,
you know,

1175
00:55:18,770 --> 00:55:19,603
that means we're going to be heavier 
than we ought to be in the electoral 

1176
00:55:21,531 --> 00:55:23,210
college.
That means we're going to be having more

1177
00:55:23,211 --> 00:55:24,044
of a voice in choosing presidents and 
judges and we better hurry up and agree 

1178
00:55:26,271 --> 00:55:27,104
to this same thing happened in Georgia 
and a couple of other small states 

1179
00:55:29,301 --> 00:55:31,190
besides Pennsylvania,
which was an odd case.

1180
00:55:31,380 --> 00:55:33,140
Um,
but then the next state up,

1181
00:55:33,141 --> 00:55:36,890
the first big state that considered this
question was Massachusetts in there.

1182
00:55:37,010 --> 00:55:37,843
It wasn't clear who had more votes in 
the convention of federalist or anti 

1183
00:55:40,371 --> 00:55:40,910
federalists.

1184
00:55:40,910 --> 00:55:42,420
So finally,
the federalist society that,

1185
00:55:42,421 --> 00:55:42,861
right,
well,

1186
00:55:42,861 --> 00:55:44,420
we don't really know that we're going to
win here.

1187
00:55:44,570 --> 00:55:47,210
So maybe we could say if you will vote 
for this thing,

1188
00:55:47,211 --> 00:55:50,150
we will promise in the first congress 
will propose amendments.

1189
00:55:50,420 --> 00:55:53,330
So this became the kind of the 
Massachusetts strategy.

1190
00:55:53,420 --> 00:55:54,253
So the later states that had close 
contests did the same thing and that's 

1191
00:55:57,921 --> 00:55:59,890
what Virginia did.
Madison's thing.

1192
00:55:59,930 --> 00:56:01,160
I don't really know whether we're going 
to get.

1193
00:56:01,520 --> 00:56:02,353
We're going to get this thing ratified 
in Virginia will promise in the first 

1194
00:56:04,851 --> 00:56:08,240
congress will propose amendments.
So that's why he's doing this right?

1195
00:56:08,241 --> 00:56:11,090
It's not because we liked the idea,
but anyway,

1196
00:56:11,240 --> 00:56:13,280
several of the states that had these 
clothes,

1197
00:56:13,281 --> 00:56:16,370
convention contests with their 
announcements,

1198
00:56:16,371 --> 00:56:17,204
we've officially ratified the thing per 
article seven also sent along here are 

1199
00:56:20,821 --> 00:56:21,654
our proposed amendments,
so what Madison did was he took the 

1200
00:56:25,600 --> 00:56:26,890
Virginia Declaration of Rights,
which we said earlier,

1201
00:56:26,891 --> 00:56:30,940
he helped to write and he took the 
English bill of rights from 1689,

1202
00:56:30,941 --> 00:56:31,774
which was a kind of a pattern for some 
of the other American declarations of 

1203
00:56:34,841 --> 00:56:35,674
rights and he took these proposals from 
various ratification conventions and 

1204
00:56:39,281 --> 00:56:42,010
found most of what's now in the bill of 
rights in those sources.

1205
00:56:42,010 --> 00:56:43,690
Right.
It's not as if he kind of made them up.

1206
00:56:43,790 --> 00:56:44,623
In fact,
the eighth amendment comes directly out 

1207
00:56:45,941 --> 00:56:46,774
of the Virginia Declaration of Rights,
which got it directly from the English 

1208
00:56:49,900 --> 00:56:51,250
bill of Rights of 16,
80 nine.

1209
00:56:51,290 --> 00:56:53,380
It's word for word the same thing.
Really?

1210
00:56:53,880 --> 00:56:54,713
Yeah.
The eighth amendment is directly from 

1211
00:56:56,140 --> 00:56:58,750
the Virginia Declaration directly from 
the English bill of rights.

1212
00:56:59,240 --> 00:57:01,290
All right,
so we've got obviously a ton here.

1213
00:57:01,310 --> 00:57:02,143
Lead it,
you know,

1214
00:57:02,460 --> 00:57:03,293
his whole life and all the work of 
founding the nation that we're governed 

1215
00:57:05,891 --> 00:57:06,880
by.
It's not done yet though.

1216
00:57:07,090 --> 00:57:07,571
No,
I know.

1217
00:57:07,571 --> 00:57:08,404
So let's talk a little bit about his 
presidency since we're doing presidents 

1218
00:57:11,400 --> 00:57:12,233
week.
What's the most important thing we need 

1219
00:57:14,111 --> 00:57:14,711
to know about?
Well,

1220
00:57:14,711 --> 00:57:17,260
this is the worst part of his career.
It's,

1221
00:57:17,400 --> 00:57:20,800
it's his foreign policy is a debacle.
In fact,

1222
00:57:20,801 --> 00:57:21,634
he had the idea in the early seventies 
and eighties that America could some 

1223
00:57:24,281 --> 00:57:28,360
extent substitute economic coercion for 
traditional military,

1224
00:57:28,680 --> 00:57:31,780
uh,
calculations in international relations.

1225
00:57:32,170 --> 00:57:34,990
So he persuaded Jefferson,
for example,

1226
00:57:34,991 --> 00:57:35,441
in Eighteen,
oh,

1227
00:57:35,441 --> 00:57:36,274
seven,
they could adopt an embargo instead of 

1228
00:57:37,631 --> 00:57:39,460
building up the military,
raising taxes,

1229
00:57:39,461 --> 00:57:40,294
buying warships,
defending American merchant ships off 

1230
00:57:42,791 --> 00:57:46,120
the coast of the United States.
Now we'll just tell foreigners,

1231
00:57:46,121 --> 00:57:46,920
okay,
if you won't,

1232
00:57:46,920 --> 00:57:50,440
if you won't treat us right at sea,
we won't trade with you.

1233
00:57:50,890 --> 00:57:55,890
This will make them do what we want.
And that the reason he had this idea was

1234
00:57:56,321 --> 00:57:59,290
because it had worked before the 
revolution in 17,

1235
00:57:59,291 --> 00:58:01,030
65,
17,

1236
00:58:01,031 --> 00:58:03,130
67,
17 slash 70.

1237
00:58:03,131 --> 00:58:06,370
The British past tax laws and the 
colonies boycotted.

1238
00:58:06,371 --> 00:58:08,680
And they repeal the laws,
so madison thinks,

1239
00:58:08,681 --> 00:58:09,251
well,
okay,

1240
00:58:09,251 --> 00:58:10,084
now we're better able to organize,
but it can be a national boycott will 

1241
00:58:12,941 --> 00:58:15,880
use the government to keep any Americans
from trading with foreigners.

1242
00:58:16,010 --> 00:58:18,880
They'll do what we want.
But the problem he had an 18,

1243
00:58:18,890 --> 00:58:21,250
12 was there was a world war going on.

1244
00:58:21,460 --> 00:58:24,370
Napoleon has armies of 3 million men in 
the field,

1245
00:58:24,640 --> 00:58:25,770
which today,
you know,

1246
00:58:26,060 --> 00:58:28,990
it doesn't sound like much.
We have 325 million Americans.

1247
00:58:29,230 --> 00:58:31,720
3 million is more than we have,
but we can have them if we wanted.

1248
00:58:32,400 --> 00:58:34,390
But on the other hand,
in 18,

1249
00:58:34,391 --> 00:58:36,970
12 francis population was like $25 
million.

1250
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:41,320
It was the biggest country in Europe.
Britain had like 15 million people,

1251
00:58:41,410 --> 00:58:44,350
3 million men in the army was 
unbelievable.

1252
00:58:44,590 --> 00:58:48,050
And Britain had over 500 warships,
right?

1253
00:58:48,180 --> 00:58:53,000
Main line warships like the dreadnoughts
in the pirates of the Caribbean movies.

1254
00:58:53,001 --> 00:58:55,360
Right?
So America is not going to compete.

1255
00:58:56,860 --> 00:58:58,780
Madison thought,
well then we shouldn't even try.

1256
00:58:58,781 --> 00:59:00,940
We should just say we're not going to 
trade with you.

1257
00:59:00,941 --> 00:59:03,550
And so they tried when he was secretary 
of state under Jefferson,

1258
00:59:03,551 --> 00:59:07,660
they tried this boycott idea.
It had no effect at all on the French,

1259
00:59:07,720 --> 00:59:08,553
on the British.
France had complete military control of 

1260
00:59:11,861 --> 00:59:16,861
Europe and Britain had complete control 
of all the oceans and it was a battle to

1261
00:59:18,191 --> 00:59:18,910
the death.

1262
00:59:18,910 --> 00:59:21,440
If the polling,
we're able to cross channel,

1263
00:59:21,441 --> 00:59:23,050
he would conquer England,
right?

1264
00:59:23,051 --> 00:59:24,620
If the British wanted to defend 
themselves,

1265
00:59:24,621 --> 00:59:27,110
they had to maintain their navy.
How are they going to do that?

1266
00:59:27,111 --> 00:59:27,944
Well,
one way was they were going to continue 

1267
00:59:30,381 --> 00:59:34,790
to force people into their navy if they 
thought there were Britain's in American

1268
00:59:35,210 --> 00:59:36,043
ships,
they were going to force them into the 

1269
00:59:37,310 --> 00:59:38,143
Royal Navy.
And the other thing was they weren't 

1270
00:59:38,571 --> 00:59:40,370
going to let the United States trade 
with France.

1271
00:59:40,670 --> 00:59:44,210
They weren't gonna let Americans carry 
products from British of,

1272
00:59:44,211 --> 00:59:46,100
I'm sorry,
from French colonies in the Caribbean to

1273
00:59:46,101 --> 00:59:48,350
France or anywhere else in Europe.
And on the other hand,

1274
00:59:48,351 --> 00:59:49,184
the French policy was,
we're not going to let the Americans 

1275
00:59:51,560 --> 00:59:55,370
trade with Europe because they're 
trading with the British.

1276
00:59:56,570 --> 00:59:59,210
Yeah.
So both neither France nor Britain could

1277
00:59:59,211 --> 01:00:00,044
be,
could possibly be persuaded to give up 

1278
01:00:02,781 --> 01:00:05,150
it's Po,
it's a strategy in this world,

1279
01:00:05,151 --> 01:00:07,520
war with the other,
because it was to the death.

1280
01:00:07,940 --> 01:00:12,290
But what the US government could do was 
it can wreck America,

1281
01:00:12,830 --> 01:00:14,840
which is what it did.
This was terrible.

1282
01:00:15,080 --> 01:00:18,200
The war of 18,
12 following this boycott.

1283
01:00:18,201 --> 01:00:22,580
The boycott was an economic disaster in 
the United States and then comes,

1284
01:00:22,581 --> 01:00:23,870
okay,
we're going to declare war.

1285
01:00:23,871 --> 01:00:24,704
Well,
one of the leading spokesman for 

1286
01:00:27,600 --> 01:00:28,433
republicanism,
old Jeffersonian Thinking was a 

1287
01:00:30,801 --> 01:00:33,560
congressman from Virginia named John 
Randolph of Roanoke,

1288
01:00:34,070 --> 01:00:36,830
and when this idea of war with Britain 
came up,

1289
01:00:36,831 --> 01:00:38,630
he said,
you're going to go to war with Britain.

1290
01:00:38,750 --> 01:00:41,270
We don't have any warships where we have
no money.

1291
01:00:41,450 --> 01:00:43,310
What are you talking?
Are you kidding?

1292
01:00:43,430 --> 01:00:45,500
This is impossible.
And of course the.

1293
01:00:45,770 --> 01:00:47,930
The result was they burned down the 
capital.

1294
01:00:47,931 --> 01:00:50,150
They burned down the White House.
They burn a library of Congress,

1295
01:00:50,151 --> 01:00:52,250
they bring the war department.
They burned the State Department.

1296
01:00:52,251 --> 01:00:53,084
They bring the Treasury Department.
That's just madison has to hop on a 

1297
01:00:56,601 --> 01:00:58,040
horse and ride out of DC.

1298
01:00:58,220 --> 01:01:00,560
This is totally predictable,
is not only predictable,

1299
01:01:00,561 --> 01:01:01,394
it was predicted,
so this is a disaster and the only 

1300
01:01:03,471 --> 01:01:04,304
reason it didn't lead to the end of the 
United States is because the British 

1301
01:01:06,801 --> 01:01:08,780
decided it's not really worth the 
effort.

1302
01:01:09,590 --> 01:01:14,510
So at one point the prime minister of 
the United Kingdom went to the greatest,

1303
01:01:14,720 --> 01:01:17,090
a British general ever,
the Duke of Wellington.

1304
01:01:17,091 --> 01:01:17,924
This was before waterloo,
but he was already the greatest general 

1305
01:01:20,450 --> 01:01:22,310
British history and he said to him,
I,

1306
01:01:22,330 --> 01:01:23,163
okay,
so I give you an army and I send you to 

1307
01:01:24,351 --> 01:01:27,020
North America.
And Wellington says,

1308
01:01:27,021 --> 01:01:27,854
well then I conquered the United States 
and then what we're going to stay there 

1309
01:01:31,290 --> 01:01:33,230
going to occupy the country were good as
that.

1310
01:01:33,920 --> 01:01:36,140
So yeah.
So then the prime minister says,

1311
01:01:36,141 --> 01:01:36,591
well,
okay,

1312
01:01:36,591 --> 01:01:41,480
then we'll negotiate a piece so that it 
was just a complete debacle.

1313
01:01:41,570 --> 01:01:44,540
You could not exaggerate the extent to 
which this is a mess.

1314
01:01:44,760 --> 01:01:45,593
The people really didn't know many 
people who write about Madison though 

1315
01:01:47,871 --> 01:01:48,920
they want.
And again,

1316
01:01:48,921 --> 01:01:51,920
this is a pitfall that biographers tend 
to fall into.

1317
01:01:51,950 --> 01:01:52,970
You know,
I'm writing about this guy,

1318
01:01:52,971 --> 01:01:55,340
so he's my hero.
What can I say that's good about him?

1319
01:01:55,550 --> 01:01:56,383
Well,
the one thing you can say that's good 

1320
01:01:57,021 --> 01:01:59,060
about Madison is a war president.
I mean,

1321
01:01:59,061 --> 01:01:59,620
he's.
He.

1322
01:01:59,620 --> 01:02:03,260
His strategy was terrible.
He picked totally inept in competent,

1323
01:02:03,500 --> 01:02:06,680
unqualified people to be his war 
secretary and he's navy secretary.

1324
01:02:06,830 --> 01:02:10,430
He just did a terrible job.
Is as a military leader,

1325
01:02:11,150 --> 01:02:15,530
but the one thing you can say about him 
is he didn't repress descent.

1326
01:02:15,780 --> 01:02:20,780
He didn't jail people.
He didn't have the army attack a militia

1327
01:02:21,421 --> 01:02:22,254
units in states that were,
by this time openly trading with the 

1328
01:02:25,441 --> 01:02:26,274
British.
He didn't put down domestic dissension 

1329
01:02:29,251 --> 01:02:31,710
the way that Lincoln did,
or Wilson did,

1330
01:02:31,711 --> 01:02:32,210
or you know,

1331
01:02:32,210 --> 01:02:33,500
that's interesting though,
so I didn't know that.

1332
01:02:33,501 --> 01:02:35,270
So states we're actually just bucking 
with.

1333
01:02:35,310 --> 01:02:36,490
Oh yeah,
yeah.

1334
01:02:37,470 --> 01:02:39,480
In New England,
people were trading with Canada,

1335
01:02:39,481 --> 01:02:40,314
which was part of the British empire,
but the New England was talking about 

1336
01:02:43,171 --> 01:02:45,540
independent,
so we should declare independence.

1337
01:02:45,690 --> 01:02:46,523
There were leading people including a 
felony and pickering who was a senator 

1338
01:02:49,471 --> 01:02:50,304
by this time.
He had been secretary of state under 

1339
01:02:51,271 --> 01:02:52,200
Washington.
He says,

1340
01:02:52,201 --> 01:02:53,790
new English would be an independent 
country,

1341
01:02:53,950 --> 01:02:56,490
were rightly,
we should be aligned with the British,

1342
01:02:56,491 --> 01:02:57,324
not with this pro French Republican 
policy that Jefferson and Madison have 

1343
01:03:01,320 --> 01:03:03,960
wrecked our economy with.
There's no reason for this.

1344
01:03:04,230 --> 01:03:08,110
So the argument that the,
uh,

1345
01:03:08,150 --> 01:03:10,980
sick of fence of,
of Madison make as well,

1346
01:03:12,090 --> 01:03:13,590
Lincoln would have jail.
These people,

1347
01:03:13,591 --> 01:03:15,720
he would have wrecked their presses.
This is what he did.

1348
01:03:15,721 --> 01:03:18,180
Or Wilson,
he would've jail all these people,

1349
01:03:18,181 --> 01:03:19,014
you know,
he would have sent the army and shot 

1350
01:03:20,250 --> 01:03:23,640
militia units that were resisting 
American policy.

1351
01:03:23,641 --> 01:03:24,391
So yeah.
Okay.

1352
01:03:24,391 --> 01:03:25,490
You can say that,
right?

1353
01:03:25,520 --> 01:03:27,630
The burden of the Capitol,
the White House Treasury state,

1354
01:03:27,990 --> 01:03:30,620
but at least he didn't.
He didn't hang dissenters.

1355
01:03:31,030 --> 01:03:32,300
Wow.
There's.

1356
01:03:32,420 --> 01:03:34,080
So,
it was a terrible though the again,

1357
01:03:34,081 --> 01:03:34,914
the only reason that the United States 
continue to exist was because Britain 

1358
01:03:36,931 --> 01:03:38,000
decided,
eh,

1359
01:03:38,600 --> 01:03:41,220
it's not worth the effort that we could 
easily.

1360
01:03:41,400 --> 01:03:42,181
Wellington's said,
yeah,

1361
01:03:42,181 --> 01:03:43,920
I conquer them.
Then what?

1362
01:03:44,070 --> 01:03:46,280
Yeah.
It's just a great line.

1363
01:03:46,700 --> 01:03:47,431
I mean,
that's the truth.

1364
01:03:47,431 --> 01:03:50,070
Nobody thinks that the then what he 
thinks about it.

1365
01:03:50,460 --> 01:03:52,920
All right.
My final question for you,

1366
01:03:53,090 --> 01:03:54,750
I mean this has been really chock full 
of,

1367
01:03:54,780 --> 01:03:57,690
of Info here because we're doing 
presidents week weekend,

1368
01:03:57,691 --> 01:04:02,691
I'm doing five different presidents and 
in five different days in the 2018 lens,

1369
01:04:03,900 --> 01:04:04,733
what do you think James Madison's 
political outlook would be because it's 

1370
01:04:08,191 --> 01:04:09,024
interesting they all sort of in the lens
of now they all sort of look like 

1371
01:04:12,301 --> 01:04:14,070
Libertarians and small government 
people.

1372
01:04:14,071 --> 01:04:14,904
But you have said several things here 
where he wanted a stronger federal 

1373
01:04:17,551 --> 01:04:18,384
government.
I know it's a kind of tricky question 

1374
01:04:20,251 --> 01:04:21,084
because it,
because our parties are so crazy right 

1375
01:04:22,111 --> 01:04:22,944
now and everything else,
but if you can give you some sense of 

1376
01:04:24,511 --> 01:04:28,050
where he might fall now or what he might
think these days.

1377
01:04:28,140 --> 01:04:28,350
Well,

1378
01:04:28,350 --> 01:04:29,183
I don't think they're all libertarians.
I don't think Washington or at Hamilton 

1379
01:04:31,471 --> 01:04:33,500
is a libertarian today.
Um,

1380
01:04:33,900 --> 01:04:34,733
but I do think people like Jefferson and
Madison to the extent that you can kind 

1381
01:04:38,671 --> 01:04:40,530
of extrapolate from what they thought 
then,

1382
01:04:40,531 --> 01:04:45,531
which they're a foreboding about the 
result of a foreign policy.

1383
01:04:48,541 --> 01:04:51,000
Like the one we've had has proven 
justified.

1384
01:04:51,480 --> 01:04:52,313
Of course,
we have huge economic distortions 

1385
01:04:55,201 --> 01:04:56,600
because of our,
our,

1386
01:04:56,610 --> 01:04:58,440
uh,
foreign policy,

1387
01:04:58,441 --> 01:04:59,274
we have a gigantic,
a remaking of the nature of our 

1388
01:05:03,361 --> 01:05:04,194
governments and we have huge diminution 
of the role of the average citizen in 

1389
01:05:08,730 --> 01:05:11,960
making his own life or shaping his own 
community are.

1390
01:05:12,420 --> 01:05:17,160
And so it's turned out kind of the way 
they thought it might in that sense.

1391
01:05:17,620 --> 01:05:18,453
On the other hand,
the fact that the union has proven 

1392
01:05:21,251 --> 01:05:22,390
stable,
the,

1393
01:05:22,960 --> 01:05:27,960
the main freedoms have been enduring.
This is somewhat surprising.

1394
01:05:30,010 --> 01:05:32,710
People thought that,
and this had been true,

1395
01:05:33,090 --> 01:05:33,923
republican isn't with short lived,
there never been a long lasting 

1396
01:05:36,011 --> 01:05:39,850
significant republic.
And so we still have a republic,

1397
01:05:40,480 --> 01:05:41,313
even if it has a lot of the elements 
that people like Jefferson and Madison 

1398
01:05:43,541 --> 01:05:46,990
and wanted to forestall or prevent it 
still republican.

1399
01:05:46,991 --> 01:05:49,420
We have freedom of speech,
we have freedom of religion,

1400
01:05:49,421 --> 01:05:53,770
we have input into what the policies 
are,

1401
01:05:53,771 --> 01:05:55,990
the government,
even if it's somewhat attenuated.

1402
01:05:56,530 --> 01:05:58,650
And so,
uh,

1403
01:05:59,560 --> 01:06:02,920
I think Jefferson would be more 
disappointed,

1404
01:06:03,010 --> 01:06:05,140
but Jefferson was disappointed by the 
time he died,

1405
01:06:05,830 --> 01:06:08,260
but I think he'd be more disappointed 
than Madison surely.

1406
01:06:08,440 --> 01:06:09,160
Yeah.

1407
01:06:09,160 --> 01:06:11,770
Wow.
That's a really interesting takeaway and

1408
01:06:11,780 --> 01:06:13,920
I think a perfect point edits.
I've thoroughly enjoyed this.

1409
01:06:13,940 --> 01:06:14,773
I mean,
Richard is acknowledge you just gave me 

1410
01:06:16,321 --> 01:06:17,610
a book.
There's a lot of stuff I'm going to have

1411
01:06:17,611 --> 01:06:21,360
to go back in and think about,
so thank you so much for more of Kevin's

1412
01:06:21,361 --> 01:06:22,194
work,
you can check out James Madison and the 

1413
01:06:23,461 --> 01:06:27,270
making of America,
which will link to write down below.
