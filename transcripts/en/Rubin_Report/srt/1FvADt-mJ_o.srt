1
00:00:02,520 --> 00:00:03,353
I want to start this week off by abiding
by one of the rules that I set up when 

2
00:00:05,551 --> 00:00:08,490
we launched this operation.
I said that if you guys fact check me,

3
00:00:08,491 --> 00:00:09,324
I would address it on the show.
I did actually make a minor error last 

4
00:00:12,690 --> 00:00:13,231
week,
believe it or not,

5
00:00:13,231 --> 00:00:14,064
while talking to my guest marginalized.
I mistakenly said that Ben Carson was a 

6
00:00:17,371 --> 00:00:20,280
neuroscientist when in fact he's a 
neurosurgeon.

7
00:00:20,440 --> 00:00:22,290
A that was really just a slip of the 
tongue,

8
00:00:22,291 --> 00:00:25,320
but a couple of you called me out on it,
so I wanted to correct myself.

9
00:00:25,710 --> 00:00:26,610
Of course,
at the end of the day,

10
00:00:26,611 --> 00:00:29,310
whether he's a neuroscientist or a 
neurosurgeon,

11
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:32,820
one thing I hope he will not become 
president of the United States.

12
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,880
We've got a really great response to our
interview with Magii last week.

13
00:00:35,881 --> 00:00:36,900
Actually,
when we finished,

14
00:00:36,901 --> 00:00:38,220
I felt like,
again,

15
00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:41,610
we had been part of an important 
conversation that needs to be had more.

16
00:00:41,910 --> 00:00:42,743
This of course is the irony of the 
regressives that bash people like Majid 

17
00:00:45,551 --> 00:00:46,384
and Sam Harris here,
you have two people from very different 

18
00:00:48,961 --> 00:00:52,230
walks of life trying to promote secular 
values and coexistence.

19
00:00:52,380 --> 00:00:55,980
Whether you agree with them or not,
on every point is totally irrelevant.

20
00:00:55,981 --> 00:00:56,814
It should be obvious to anyone with half
a brain that these are the guys trying 

21
00:00:59,521 --> 00:01:02,460
to find a peaceful way forward.
Don't take my word for it.

22
00:01:02,461 --> 00:01:04,890
They'll listen to them speak themselves 
and by the way,

23
00:01:04,891 --> 00:01:08,340
you can disagree with them on where they
stand on certain issues,

24
00:01:08,490 --> 00:01:11,640
yet acknowledged that they're having a 
very difficult dialogue,

25
00:01:11,641 --> 00:01:12,474
unexplainably,
heated topics that most people are 

26
00:01:14,101 --> 00:01:16,020
completely afraid to have in the first 
place.

27
00:01:16,410 --> 00:01:19,380
When a journalist called modular porch 
monkey and Sam a racist,

28
00:01:19,381 --> 00:01:20,214
it exposes who the real extremists are 
in case you missed it on Friday nights 

29
00:01:22,890 --> 00:01:23,723
realtime.
Bill Maher had an excellent sit down 

30
00:01:25,051 --> 00:01:27,750
with Richard Dawkins on this new split 
on the left.

31
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:28,793
I was thrilled to hear Bill Maher 
actually use the phrase regressive 

32
00:01:31,711 --> 00:01:34,890
leftist bill credited Sam Harris for 
coining the phrase though,

33
00:01:34,891 --> 00:01:38,820
from what I understand,
Majid was using it as far back as 2012.

34
00:01:39,030 --> 00:01:39,863
In any event,
the fact that it trickled up to bill 

35
00:01:41,701 --> 00:01:42,534
shows you that the discussions we're 
having here on the show as well as the 

36
00:01:44,851 --> 00:01:45,684
ones that you guys are having on twitter
and youtube are actually making a 

37
00:01:48,571 --> 00:01:50,730
difference.
That's the beauty of the Internet.

38
00:01:51,030 --> 00:01:55,080
You can get issues to actually bubble up
until mainstream takes notice.

39
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:56,153
There is evidence of the awakening that 
I've been talking about all over the 

40
00:01:58,351 --> 00:01:59,184
place right now on twitter.
Someone asked me if by calling these 

41
00:02:01,351 --> 00:02:02,184
people the regressive left,
if I'm just resorting to the same type 

42
00:02:04,951 --> 00:02:07,680
of name calling that we accuse them of 
my answer to,

43
00:02:07,681 --> 00:02:08,514
this is a hundred percent no.
We're giving a name to a problem we've 

44
00:02:11,161 --> 00:02:12,870
all seen growing for a long time.

45
00:02:12,870 --> 00:02:13,703
Now we can debate with them on facts if 
they accept facts as such and not just 

46
00:02:16,861 --> 00:02:19,410
cherry pick them when suitable for their
narrative.

47
00:02:19,650 --> 00:02:20,483
The reason I feel like naming them is so
important is because I now view these 

48
00:02:23,281 --> 00:02:26,310
regressives as the left's version of the
tea party.

49
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:29,310
The tea party went unchecked by the 
right until it was too late,

50
00:02:29,311 --> 00:02:32,130
and now the Republican Party is a 
fractured mess,

51
00:02:32,131 --> 00:02:34,500
often only held together by its worst 
beliefs.

52
00:02:34,770 --> 00:02:35,603
I really believe these regressives are 
doing this to the left and if we don't 

53
00:02:38,161 --> 00:02:38,994
have the courage to stop them,
then a year or two from now will wonder 

54
00:02:41,521 --> 00:02:44,580
why our system is even screwed up more 
than it is now.

55
00:02:44,910 --> 00:02:45,743
That's why talking about all this stuff 
is important and that's why we're going 

56
00:02:47,741 --> 00:02:49,620
to continue to do so.
With that out of the way,

57
00:02:49,621 --> 00:02:52,350
it's time to sit down with the outspoken
Breitbart,

58
00:02:52,351 --> 00:02:55,020
conservative Milo Yiannopoulos and fear 
not.

59
00:02:55,021 --> 00:02:57,780
I won't let any of his sif like logic 
screw with my thinking.

60
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:01,353
My guest this week is a writer for 
Breitbart Dot Com and a general rabble 

61
00:03:04,151 --> 00:03:07,390
rouser and renaissance men,
Milo Yiannopoulos.

62
00:03:07,391 --> 00:03:09,220
Welcome to the show.
Thanks so much for having me.

63
00:03:09,370 --> 00:03:12,100
So when I tweeted out originally that 
you were coming in,

64
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:15,640
half the people told me I was going to 
absolutely hate you.

65
00:03:15,670 --> 00:03:18,920
Half the people told me I was gonna.
Love you for wrong.

66
00:03:18,940 --> 00:03:20,350
They're the first half or wrong.
Yeah.

67
00:03:20,351 --> 00:03:21,430
All right,
so uh,

68
00:03:21,431 --> 00:03:23,110
so we actually had a drink the other 
night.

69
00:03:23,290 --> 00:03:24,123
We want to be totally transparent here.
We had a drink the other night and we 

70
00:03:26,621 --> 00:03:27,454
talked a little bit.
So we've gotten to know each other 

71
00:03:28,421 --> 00:03:33,421
however much you can in an hour.
You are a gay conservative now.

72
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:37,630
I want to repeat that just so that the 
audience can be clear.

73
00:03:37,631 --> 00:03:39,880
You are a gay,
you think you need to repeat anything?

74
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:41,560
It's weird.
Conservative people.

75
00:03:41,590 --> 00:03:42,650
People will be strange.
Well,

76
00:03:42,660 --> 00:03:45,190
people freak out.
So let's just start.

77
00:03:45,310 --> 00:03:49,030
Let's just start.
What is a conservative to you in 2015?

78
00:03:49,031 --> 00:03:52,390
Because I think people don't even know 
what sort of basic terms anymore,

79
00:03:52,391 --> 00:03:53,580
much less the gay part,
but let's just.

80
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:54,513
What is a concern?

81
00:03:55,170 --> 00:03:56,003
I think the reason people surprised 
about a gay conservative is because we 

82
00:03:59,311 --> 00:04:00,144
have a slightly outdated notion of what 
conservatism is now in the religious 

83
00:04:03,751 --> 00:04:04,584
right in America doesn't have the same 
purchase on the public imagination 

84
00:04:06,121 --> 00:04:06,954
anymore that it wants did.
So it's a sort of part of the ripe but 

85
00:04:08,661 --> 00:04:11,850
not hold of it.
And the rice in Europe is drifting quite

86
00:04:11,851 --> 00:04:14,790
quickly to the left.
So conservatism as a movement,

87
00:04:14,791 --> 00:04:16,770
as political philosophy is a bit lost at
the moment.

88
00:04:17,010 --> 00:04:17,843
One thing we can say for sure is that 
people on both sides of the political 

89
00:04:19,771 --> 00:04:23,310
spectrum are moving toward a sort of 
center right libertarianism,

90
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:28,470
and for me the big gap between people,
the big sort of defining political,

91
00:04:28,620 --> 00:04:30,810
a schism,
particularly on the Internet,

92
00:04:30,811 --> 00:04:33,150
but I think if everybody really is not 
left and right anymore,

93
00:04:33,151 --> 00:04:35,280
it's becoming between authoritarians and
Libertarians.

94
00:04:35,580 --> 00:04:38,010
The issue for the left being that there 
isn't much space for Libertarians,

95
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:38,953
they're conservatives who don't know,
honestly very religious or find their 

96
00:04:43,591 --> 00:04:44,424
own party drifting to the left are 
beginning to call themselves 

97
00:04:47,551 --> 00:04:50,940
conservative or began to call themselves
libertarians or conservator Darien.

98
00:04:50,941 --> 00:04:51,774
So I think it's an interesting 
distinction to talk speak in terms of 

99
00:04:54,751 --> 00:04:57,810
personal liberty and freedom now.
And when you understand it like that,

100
00:04:57,811 --> 00:04:59,490
it makes much more sense why a gay 
person would be one.

101
00:04:59,590 --> 00:05:00,423
Right?
So the part that we sort of fall out on 

102
00:05:02,101 --> 00:05:02,934
the,
on the same spot is the authoritarian 

103
00:05:04,561 --> 00:05:06,250
and libertarian part of this.
Right?

104
00:05:06,270 --> 00:05:08,170
Because we don't like the 
authoritarians.

105
00:05:08,171 --> 00:05:10,150
I think both of us are sort of 
libertarians,

106
00:05:10,270 --> 00:05:12,760
libertarians are thought more of in the 
conservative space,

107
00:05:12,940 --> 00:05:13,773
but if you were to give me like a three 
sentence synopsis of when you say to 

108
00:05:15,791 --> 00:05:16,930
someone,
I'm a conservative,

109
00:05:17,140 --> 00:05:18,750
what are you,
what are the principles there?

110
00:05:18,751 --> 00:05:19,420
What,
what are,

111
00:05:19,420 --> 00:05:21,190
what is the basic bullet principles?

112
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:24,340
I think you believe in individual 
personal responsibility.

113
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:28,000
You believe in freedom of thought,
of expression,

114
00:05:28,001 --> 00:05:31,240
of creativity.
You believe in free markets.

115
00:05:31,241 --> 00:05:32,074
You believe that the relationship,
the individual in the state should be 

116
00:05:33,521 --> 00:05:35,890
circumscribed quite clearly and quite 
crisply.

117
00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:36,893
So you believe that state has a limited 
and quite well defined set of 

118
00:05:39,581 --> 00:05:41,590
responsibilities beyond which it should 
not stretch.

119
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:42,713
Um,
you believe in the power and value of 

120
00:05:45,581 --> 00:05:48,160
institutional authority and community 
structures.

121
00:05:48,161 --> 00:05:50,530
So you believe that even if you may,
for example,

122
00:05:50,531 --> 00:05:52,180
believe that even if you're not a 
Christian,

123
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:53,273
you still recognize that the church has 
something to offer that is a valuable 

124
00:05:55,691 --> 00:05:58,400
institution that keeps up kids that 
we'll get to that.

125
00:05:59,340 --> 00:06:01,640
But likewise,
institutions like monarchy,

126
00:06:01,730 --> 00:06:04,460
you respect them because you understand 
that even though,

127
00:06:04,490 --> 00:06:06,410
for example,
it would be very difficult to defend the

128
00:06:06,411 --> 00:06:08,840
monarchy in purely logistical.
Oh,

129
00:06:08,870 --> 00:06:12,410
purely a logical terms these days.
Nonetheless,

130
00:06:12,411 --> 00:06:14,810
it works best in Britain.
It is the best system yet devised and it

131
00:06:14,811 --> 00:06:15,620
works brilliantly.
Impression,

132
00:06:15,620 --> 00:06:17,390
even if you,
if you were to design a state today,

133
00:06:17,391 --> 00:06:20,330
you wouldn't come up with it and 
consider a lot of the commenters.

134
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:22,610
Are we on the wrong,
obviously wrong.

135
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:23,873
Conservatives instinctively understand 
that the value of tradition and 

136
00:06:27,831 --> 00:06:28,664
authority and um,
and of course levels wants to tear all 

137
00:06:31,311 --> 00:06:32,144
those things down.
So I think those are some of the things 

138
00:06:33,321 --> 00:06:35,030
that people mean when they describe 
themselves as conservative.

139
00:06:35,150 --> 00:06:36,600
Right?
So the reason I think it's,

140
00:06:36,601 --> 00:06:40,700
it's sort of a confusing term or that 
all our terms have become confusing,

141
00:06:40,701 --> 00:06:44,690
I think is because a lot of times now,
as you sort of alluded to in America,

142
00:06:44,691 --> 00:06:48,200
we think of conservatives somehow as an 
attachment to the religious right,

143
00:06:48,380 --> 00:06:50,990
which is weakening a little bit,
which I think is good.

144
00:06:51,230 --> 00:06:52,063
And you're saying in in England it's a 
little more of a respect for the 

145
00:06:54,990 --> 00:06:57,320
monarchy.
Monarchy has respect for traditions,

146
00:06:57,321 --> 00:06:58,460
but I think a lot of people would say,
well,

147
00:06:58,461 --> 00:06:59,480
you're just in it for the man,

148
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:00,910
right?
Well,

149
00:07:00,911 --> 00:07:02,440
I think it's preposterous.
And if you look at the,

150
00:07:02,660 --> 00:07:05,560
look at how many working class 
conservative voters there are,

151
00:07:05,850 --> 00:07:08,680
why would all of these people be voting 
against their own interests if that were

152
00:07:08,681 --> 00:07:09,514
true?
And if conservatism are really about 

153
00:07:10,331 --> 00:07:11,164
protecting rich people,
why would millions of of people who 

154
00:07:13,781 --> 00:07:14,614
struggle to make rent or struggle to put
their kids through college or struggle 

155
00:07:17,561 --> 00:07:18,710
even perhaps to,
you know,

156
00:07:18,730 --> 00:07:20,830
to feed their families,
vote conservative.

157
00:07:20,831 --> 00:07:23,360
They do it because they appreciate the 
value of,

158
00:07:23,660 --> 00:07:26,770
of some of the structures around that 
they love and they do it because they,

159
00:07:27,130 --> 00:07:30,820
they believe in a certain limited the 
state's power.

160
00:07:30,821 --> 00:07:32,610
They believe in other things that go 
with conservatism.

161
00:07:32,611 --> 00:07:33,444
You why would so many people vote 
against their interest and it's just 

162
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:36,513
absurd characterization of childish 
characterization of conservatism to 

163
00:07:39,611 --> 00:07:40,444
suggest that it is in some way just 
assist them to protect them and protect 

164
00:07:42,851 --> 00:07:43,684
the Richard protect corporations.
I think we can all agree that 

165
00:07:45,161 --> 00:07:48,010
corporatism and I'm mature late 
capitalism,

166
00:07:48,700 --> 00:07:49,533
which existence of intricate symbiosis 
with the private sector and in some 

167
00:07:52,391 --> 00:07:56,140
cases quite poisonous in that respect,
the bailout of the banks in the UK,

168
00:07:56,141 --> 00:07:58,730
the sorts of corporate cronyism it 
happens in America.

169
00:07:58,780 --> 00:08:00,000
Plenty of it here too,
right?

170
00:08:00,001 --> 00:08:01,870
If course.
I think we all agree that's a bad thing,

171
00:08:01,871 --> 00:08:04,540
but it is by no means restricted to one 
side of the political spectrum.

172
00:08:04,700 --> 00:08:05,091
Yeah.
Well,

173
00:08:05,091 --> 00:08:07,310
I always say there's a reason that at 
least in America,

174
00:08:07,580 --> 00:08:08,413
you know,
the one percent give basically 51 

175
00:08:09,951 --> 00:08:10,784
percent of the Republicans and 49 
percent to the Democrats because 

176
00:08:13,221 --> 00:08:14,330
they're,
they're hedging their bets.

177
00:08:14,450 --> 00:08:16,180
So yeah,
I don't believe it goes down to either

178
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:16,860
already know.
And I,

179
00:08:16,860 --> 00:08:17,320
you know,
if,

180
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:18,153
if you,
if you take the view that conservatism 

181
00:08:20,241 --> 00:08:21,074
is about,
you know,

182
00:08:22,190 --> 00:08:23,750
uh,
sticking out for the man,

183
00:08:23,751 --> 00:08:24,584
you have to explain things like why 
conservatives give more money to 

184
00:08:26,061 --> 00:08:26,894
charity,
why even conservatives who aren't 

185
00:08:28,701 --> 00:08:29,534
religious give more charity.
There are lots of very difficult 

186
00:08:31,221 --> 00:08:32,054
questions you have to answer.
If you want to make that argument for 

187
00:08:33,741 --> 00:08:34,610
me,
it doesn't hold water.

188
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:35,260
All right,
well that's,

189
00:08:35,260 --> 00:08:38,100
that's sort of where I wanted to jump 
off from and just get a basic,

190
00:08:38,180 --> 00:08:42,810
a basic set of rules that were sort of 
talking about here and I think we,

191
00:08:42,811 --> 00:08:46,240
I think we sorted it not remotely the 
most interesting thing about it.

192
00:08:46,241 --> 00:08:46,680
Yeah.
All right.

193
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:48,330
Well now we're going to get into some of
the interesting stuff.

194
00:08:48,331 --> 00:08:49,830
So first thing I want to ask you about 
is,

195
00:08:49,831 --> 00:08:54,420
I think I found out about you originally
because of Gamer Gate that I've done one

196
00:08:54,421 --> 00:08:58,980
video on gate.
It was about a year ago and so basically

197
00:08:58,981 --> 00:09:00,390
I said to the audience,
I said,

198
00:09:00,570 --> 00:09:01,141
I said,
guys,

199
00:09:01,141 --> 00:09:02,640
look,
I don't really understand this thing.

200
00:09:02,670 --> 00:09:03,503
I don't know what's going on here.
I have a sense it has to do with some 

201
00:09:05,731 --> 00:09:06,564
people that were upset at some of the 
publications and then all this doxing 

202
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:11,610
and all and massage and yoga.
But I,

203
00:09:11,611 --> 00:09:12,570
this is,
I don't know,

204
00:09:12,571 --> 00:09:15,000
so I don't know that I can address it.
Now you're in the thick of this thing.

205
00:09:15,270 --> 00:09:16,970
So I thought if we do one thing I gained
very,

206
00:09:17,010 --> 00:09:20,160
can we do like a five minute really hash
it out?

207
00:09:20,190 --> 00:09:21,023
Honest

208
00:09:21,530 --> 00:09:24,150
what Gamergate was really about five 
minutes for you.

209
00:09:26,430 --> 00:09:30,360
We're all used to seeing these social 
justice warriors to police language.

210
00:09:30,361 --> 00:09:30,980
You say that

211
00:09:30,980 --> 00:09:32,080
we're going to do plenty on that.

212
00:09:32,470 --> 00:09:35,770
Very random things or sexist or racist 
or misogynist or whatever.

213
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:40,390
I think we're all used to.
Now I'm the press in some cases,

214
00:09:40,391 --> 00:09:42,400
reporting on things extraordinarily 
badly now.

215
00:09:42,430 --> 00:09:43,263
Gamergate has been a huge controversy 
with people who care about these things 

216
00:09:44,951 --> 00:09:46,390
because both of those things have come 
together.

217
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:50,500
It is a consumer movement that rejects 
sloppy standards in,

218
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:54,070
in reporting about video games and video
games by the way,

219
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:55,990
are very important part of the 
entertainment industry.

220
00:09:55,991 --> 00:09:57,640
They're bigger than Hollywood now.
It's 97,

221
00:09:57,641 --> 00:09:59,590
90,
probably about by now $90,000,000,000

222
00:09:59,591 --> 00:10:00,424
industry rejects sloppy reporting about 
that and all sorts of horrible 

223
00:10:02,711 --> 00:10:05,130
infractions of journalistic ethics and 
conflicts of interest.

224
00:10:05,170 --> 00:10:05,720
Almost it.

225
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:06,553
Wait,
just to stay on that though for a 

226
00:10:06,921 --> 00:10:07,754
second.
So basically the game companies were 

227
00:10:09,711 --> 00:10:12,080
sort of paying the writers to give them 
better reviews.

228
00:10:12,081 --> 00:10:12,914
Is that

229
00:10:13,650 --> 00:10:14,483
things like that going on if 10 people 
sleeping with people and writing things 

230
00:10:17,250 --> 00:10:18,990
about them a bit too closely,
they shouldn't have.

231
00:10:18,991 --> 00:10:22,350
Basically.
It's a very fast growing industry,

232
00:10:22,590 --> 00:10:23,423
so the presses nascent,
the presses grown up very fast and what 

233
00:10:25,651 --> 00:10:27,230
was previously a trade press,
you know,

234
00:10:27,231 --> 00:10:28,064
like you know,
tree cutters weekly or the stamp 

235
00:10:29,611 --> 00:10:30,444
collectors monthly or whatever has 
suddenly become a consumer press and it 

236
00:10:32,791 --> 00:10:36,180
hasn't necessarily improved it standards
commensurate with that.

237
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:39,870
The second half of it is the social 
justice warriors who mentioned briefly.

238
00:10:39,871 --> 00:10:40,704
There is a sort of insurgent move in 
video games from a couple of wacky left 

239
00:10:45,771 --> 00:10:50,100
wing feminists and these are sort of far
left Israel hating Socialist Weirdos.

240
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:54,990
I'm fall a feminist to say that every,
every video game is problematic.

241
00:10:55,020 --> 00:10:57,420
That there is something wrong with all 
these video games and if for some reason

242
00:10:58,020 --> 00:11:00,710
the journalists have sucked all this up 
and have bought it all in a digit,

243
00:11:00,711 --> 00:11:04,080
the same journalists who protected video
games when the religious right in the 19

244
00:11:04,081 --> 00:11:04,914
eighties and nineties said that video 
games turn kids into killers and 

245
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:10,650
violent,
which there is no evidence of right.

246
00:11:10,651 --> 00:11:11,700
We have one more slide.
None whatsoever.

247
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:12,593
None whatsoever.
Yeah.

248
00:11:12,660 --> 00:11:13,493
Those same journalists nonetheless have 
rolled over and accepted the feminist 

249
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:17,970
critique of video games and said,
oh,

250
00:11:17,971 --> 00:11:19,140
well,
video games got me get violent,

251
00:11:19,141 --> 00:11:20,700
but they can make you sexist now.
Again,

252
00:11:20,870 --> 00:11:23,400
there is no evidence whatsoever.
That's the case.

253
00:11:23,670 --> 00:11:24,503
The research is the most generous you 
could be is to say the research is that 

254
00:11:29,420 --> 00:11:31,770
the jury is out,
but most of the most,

255
00:11:31,771 --> 00:11:33,180
most of the most credible research.
There's.

256
00:11:33,181 --> 00:11:34,014
There's nothing

257
00:11:34,190 --> 00:11:36,530
to be real clear on that.
So that would be like for example,

258
00:11:36,531 --> 00:11:37,364
in a game like grand theft auto where 
you can literally grab a woman out of 

259
00:11:40,251 --> 00:11:43,730
her car hunter,
but you can do that to a man too,

260
00:11:43,731 --> 00:11:44,564
so you would.
You would argue that that that's not 

261
00:11:46,590 --> 00:11:48,330
what the anti woman because they're 
there.

262
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:50,120
It's a festival.
It's a festival.

263
00:11:50,121 --> 00:11:51,470
It's imaginary.
It's not real.

264
00:11:51,890 --> 00:11:53,490
And second of all,
yeah,

265
00:11:53,590 --> 00:11:54,190
it's on his computer

266
00:11:54,190 --> 00:11:57,700
screen and second of all,
what much of the evidence shows actually

267
00:11:57,830 --> 00:11:58,663
is that people who get stuff out of 
their system and it's mainly boys who 

268
00:12:00,881 --> 00:12:01,714
get the stuff out of their system 
playing video games on nicer to people 

269
00:12:04,511 --> 00:12:07,180
in the real world because it's that sort
of boyish testosterone thing.

270
00:12:07,181 --> 00:12:08,014
I mean,
even as homosexual is we have some 

271
00:12:08,741 --> 00:12:12,060
understanding of that male need to sort 
of win and crushed and you know,

272
00:12:12,070 --> 00:12:13,610
and do that kind of,
well,

273
00:12:13,620 --> 00:12:14,550
you know,
you know,

274
00:12:14,610 --> 00:12:15,940
you probably play sports.
I don't,

275
00:12:15,941 --> 00:12:16,490
but you know,
I,

276
00:12:16,490 --> 00:12:16,990
I,
I,

277
00:12:16,990 --> 00:12:20,430
I take that out horizontally.
But there is,

278
00:12:20,470 --> 00:12:22,060
there is that sort of male need to get,
you know,

279
00:12:22,061 --> 00:12:24,190
get that sort of testosterone energy out
for system.

280
00:12:24,430 --> 00:12:27,040
Uh,
and when boys do that in video games,

281
00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:29,770
much of the evidence shows that they 
behave nicer and rural life.

282
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:30,633
Now some have some studies say that 
video games can make you hyper 

283
00:12:33,601 --> 00:12:34,120
competitive.

284
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:34,953
So the FIFA Games,
the football games can leave somebody a 

285
00:12:36,281 --> 00:12:37,990
bit more competitive,
can raise testosterone levels.

286
00:12:37,991 --> 00:12:38,824
But that's a very temporary effect.
There's absolutely no evidence 

287
00:12:41,681 --> 00:12:42,514
whatsoever.
The video games can make is sexist and 

288
00:12:43,391 --> 00:12:46,360
these sorts of Cherry picked insane 
feminists.

289
00:12:46,361 --> 00:12:48,160
I mean just just,
just the most barmy bunkers,

290
00:12:48,161 --> 00:12:50,380
all of the.
We'll get onto feminism later,

291
00:12:50,381 --> 00:12:54,310
but it's coming.
If you imagine the most wacky,

292
00:12:54,311 --> 00:12:57,460
stereotypical blue haired,
overweight,

293
00:12:57,461 --> 00:12:58,890
furious,
you know,

294
00:12:59,050 --> 00:13:01,300
fact free,
terrible lesbian.

295
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:05,680
I'm a lesbian and a feminist whether or 
lesbians.

296
00:13:05,681 --> 00:13:08,920
Now I'm lesbian,
feminist kind of lunatic.

297
00:13:09,460 --> 00:13:11,890
That's the sort of person that's 
criticizing video games.

298
00:13:11,891 --> 00:13:13,780
And very often the people don't even 
play video games.

299
00:13:13,781 --> 00:13:14,614
This is,
this is another chapter in the culture 

300
00:13:15,401 --> 00:13:17,230
wars which were used to from the movies 
and from books.

301
00:13:17,231 --> 00:13:22,231
And so the gate know game.
Ordinary gamers have put up for 10 years

302
00:13:24,071 --> 00:13:24,904
or more with their own press calling 
them man babies and misogynists beating 

303
00:13:27,951 --> 00:13:31,090
up on them basically because it's the 
trendy thing to do because these days,

304
00:13:31,780 --> 00:13:33,850
progressivism and um,
you know,

305
00:13:33,851 --> 00:13:35,800
sort of hating on men that kill all 
white men,

306
00:13:35,801 --> 00:13:39,040
kind of these feminists hashtags are 
socially acceptable.

307
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:39,391
I mean,
you,

308
00:13:39,391 --> 00:13:39,701
you,
you,

309
00:13:39,701 --> 00:13:42,190
there is no,
you will get no social censure from your

310
00:13:42,191 --> 00:13:43,024
peers as far as a member of the media 
today for tweeting one of those 

311
00:13:45,401 --> 00:13:46,151
hashtags.
Now,

312
00:13:46,151 --> 00:13:47,340
obviously if you did it the other way 
around,

313
00:13:47,350 --> 00:13:48,850
it would be a problem.
Um,

314
00:13:49,330 --> 00:13:51,640
that's become fashionable.
It's become trendy for White,

315
00:13:52,010 --> 00:13:53,180
sort of white guilt,
right?

316
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:54,033
White middle class girls become 
fashionable for these people to beat up 

317
00:13:55,571 --> 00:13:57,700
on themselves,
prostrate themselves before the altar of

318
00:13:57,701 --> 00:13:58,534
womanhood and say that everything that 
they are and everything that they do is 

319
00:14:00,881 --> 00:14:01,960
terrible.
I'm so sorry.

320
00:14:01,961 --> 00:14:02,850
You know,
mother guy,

321
00:14:02,851 --> 00:14:04,690
or how can I make it up to you?
Um,

322
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:07,510
the reality is that actually these video
games quite good for people.

323
00:14:08,370 --> 00:14:09,630
That's the crux of it.
Then it's,

324
00:14:09,690 --> 00:14:12,930
it's these people,
it's the gaming community that

325
00:14:12,940 --> 00:14:14,560
that is a risk that has risen up because
it's,

326
00:14:14,850 --> 00:14:15,683
it's,
it is tired of being lied about and 

327
00:14:16,841 --> 00:14:17,674
slandered by its own press press.
The did a really good job of defending 

328
00:14:19,721 --> 00:14:20,554
it when the violence stuff is going on.
Jack Thompson in the nineties were 

329
00:14:22,431 --> 00:14:22,811
saying,
but again,

330
00:14:22,811 --> 00:14:23,644
it can make you violent.
The press did a really good job of 

331
00:14:24,371 --> 00:14:26,050
rebutting him because he was 
conservative,

332
00:14:26,290 --> 00:14:26,811
but when,
uh,

333
00:14:26,811 --> 00:14:29,140
a liberal and progressive critic comes 
along,

334
00:14:29,141 --> 00:14:32,800
they fall over themselves to agree and 
start hating on their own audience.

335
00:14:32,940 --> 00:14:33,810
Right.
And that's really interesting.

336
00:14:33,811 --> 00:14:34,644
And it goes to really what,
90 percent of what we're going to talk 

337
00:14:36,541 --> 00:14:39,270
to talk about Isabelle,
because right.

338
00:14:39,271 --> 00:14:41,690
I remember when Joe Lieberman,
who's,

339
00:14:41,900 --> 00:14:43,410
you know,
was on the right at that time,

340
00:14:43,411 --> 00:14:44,244
I guess he's an independent now when he 
was railing against violence in video 

341
00:14:47,281 --> 00:14:50,700
games with mortal Kombat.
I remember it was very cool to say what,

342
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:52,020
what loser he was

343
00:14:52,020 --> 00:14:52,940
and so added touch and.
Well,

344
00:14:52,941 --> 00:14:53,774
the problem with some,
the problem with video games from the 

345
00:14:55,650 --> 00:14:58,070
gamers is they have no social capital.
Everybody hates them.

346
00:14:58,100 --> 00:14:58,933
The right hates video games because it 
says they call a school shootings and 

347
00:15:00,771 --> 00:15:03,320
because they're violent and a bit and 
deviant and Dorky,

348
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:04,753
and you've got the sort of from the 
religious right that complains that 

349
00:15:07,641 --> 00:15:08,200
they,
you know,

350
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:10,330
can introduce dangerous,
uh,

351
00:15:10,340 --> 00:15:11,060
you know,
thoughts of,

352
00:15:11,060 --> 00:15:11,893
into people's minds,
to nobody was killing anybody in the 

353
00:15:14,301 --> 00:15:15,980
name of God before video games.
Right.

354
00:15:15,990 --> 00:15:18,200
I've never happened.
We can talk about that.

355
00:15:18,201 --> 00:15:19,034
I,
Oh,

356
00:15:19,470 --> 00:15:21,950
a,
some sort of thing.

357
00:15:21,951 --> 00:15:25,230
Atheist,
serial killers will get up there.

358
00:15:25,610 --> 00:15:26,510
Isn't,
you know,

359
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:28,040
be we're doing this in the nineties.
Right.

360
00:15:28,041 --> 00:15:29,630
And the game's press did a great job of 
defending,

361
00:15:29,990 --> 00:15:31,820
defending video games against those 
charges.

362
00:15:32,270 --> 00:15:34,280
They've done a much less job,
a good job.

363
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:35,113
In fact,
they've done no job at all of defending 

364
00:15:35,691 --> 00:15:36,524
it against feminists who are just as 
wacky and just as crazy as the old 

365
00:15:39,620 --> 00:15:40,640
religious right.
And in fact,

366
00:15:40,641 --> 00:15:43,670
the feminists say all the same things.
They hate the same things they hate.

367
00:15:43,671 --> 00:15:45,740
Nudity and violence are all the same 
stuff.

368
00:15:45,770 --> 00:15:48,350
This is why some very clever Brendan 
O'Neill,

369
00:15:48,351 --> 00:15:50,690
who is a wonderful economist and Britain
wrote in the spectator.

370
00:15:50,691 --> 00:15:52,010
A great thing about it was a 
provocation,

371
00:15:52,011 --> 00:15:52,844
but it was,
it was interesting about how feminism 

372
00:15:54,171 --> 00:15:55,004
looks quite like Islam.
Islam in some regards there because it 

373
00:15:56,151 --> 00:16:00,050
hits the same thing it hits female 
nudity to and it asks for the same staff

374
00:16:00,051 --> 00:16:02,060
and it has,
uses the same language I wrote,

375
00:16:02,180 --> 00:16:04,790
I did a silly quiz online in my column 
about,

376
00:16:05,140 --> 00:16:05,973
you know,
Anita Sarkeesian and was the leading 

377
00:16:06,471 --> 00:16:09,860
feminist critic of video games or Jack 
Thompson who was the nineties.

378
00:16:09,860 --> 00:16:10,693
We'll just write guy and I just sort of 
a lined up a lot of quotes from each of 

379
00:16:14,241 --> 00:16:16,700
them and asked to go in here to pick 
which you,

380
00:16:16,701 --> 00:16:18,470
who said it and then,
but never got more than five out of 10,

381
00:16:18,630 --> 00:16:19,090
uh,
which,

382
00:16:19,090 --> 00:16:19,980
which is my point,
you know,

383
00:16:20,020 --> 00:16:23,390
they say the same thing,
same language and it goes to that.

384
00:16:23,570 --> 00:16:25,460
That difference is not really about left
and right.

385
00:16:25,461 --> 00:16:28,610
It's not worry about politics anymore.
The most important political distinction

386
00:16:28,611 --> 00:16:31,910
in people since more of our,
as more of our lives move online,

387
00:16:31,950 --> 00:16:35,030
more of our discourses online as more 
people navigate the Internet.

388
00:16:35,031 --> 00:16:37,550
What the Internet has done to politics 
is very interesting,

389
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:41,230
is turned every major culture,
war and every major discussion into,

390
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:44,420
around between authoritarians want to 
control how other people live,

391
00:16:44,750 --> 00:16:45,583
and Libertarians who either want to 
escape into fantasy worlds because they 

392
00:16:48,300 --> 00:16:50,150
want to escape,
you know,

393
00:16:50,260 --> 00:16:51,093
was going on in their life or simply 
classical liberals like me who believe 

394
00:16:53,660 --> 00:16:55,460
in freedom of expression,
freedom of thought,

395
00:16:55,520 --> 00:16:58,160
liberty of,
of idea,

396
00:16:58,161 --> 00:16:58,930
and,
and,

397
00:16:58,930 --> 00:17:03,830
and believe that it is essential for the
good of our species if you like it,

398
00:17:03,831 --> 00:17:06,980
if you want to get serious about it,
that we can talk about everything openly

399
00:17:06,981 --> 00:17:09,470
and honestly and that there are no,
no go areas.

400
00:17:09,930 --> 00:17:12,480
I'm more what my colleague at Breitbart 
Alim Bukhari Cause,

401
00:17:12,481 --> 00:17:13,820
uh,
a cultural libertarian.

402
00:17:13,821 --> 00:17:15,110
I'm not a libertarian politically 
speaking,

403
00:17:15,111 --> 00:17:15,944
but I believe that in culture there 
should be no boundaries and that we 

404
00:17:17,871 --> 00:17:20,800
should be able to explore everything.
Um,

405
00:17:20,900 --> 00:17:23,630
video games are sailed on all sides from
the left,

406
00:17:23,631 --> 00:17:24,900
from the right,
from everybody,

407
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:25,753
by people who want to restrict the 
acceptable limits of a creative 

408
00:17:29,511 --> 00:17:31,070
expression.
I think that's dangerous.

409
00:17:31,220 --> 00:17:32,840
I think it's dangerous wherever it 
happens.

410
00:17:33,050 --> 00:17:33,883
I think video games are the most 
interesting entertainment medium in 

411
00:17:36,381 --> 00:17:37,214
which it's happening now because it is 
the because gamers are the first people 

412
00:17:39,921 --> 00:17:40,754
who rose up and said no to the social 
justice warriors and it was a horrible 

413
00:17:43,371 --> 00:17:44,990
and humiliating defeat for them.
Right.

414
00:17:44,991 --> 00:17:45,824
So it's actually interesting.
And then we'll move on to feminism 

415
00:17:48,111 --> 00:17:49,770
specifically,
but it's really interesting because this

416
00:17:49,771 --> 00:17:50,130
is sort

417
00:17:50,130 --> 00:17:53,670
of the awakening that I now see 
happening in our political discussion.

418
00:17:53,671 --> 00:17:54,504
People are now hitting on this 
libertarian thing and fighting the 

419
00:17:57,481 --> 00:17:58,820
authorities,
but it's.

420
00:17:59,010 --> 00:18:00,620
But it's still relate.
The machine is

421
00:18:01,230 --> 00:18:02,370
Saunas.
It's trump,

422
00:18:02,700 --> 00:18:03,533
it's farrage and Corbin in the UK.
All of the populist political movements 

423
00:18:07,261 --> 00:18:08,094
on the left and the right,
they come from all over the counter 

424
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:13,230
counter cultural antiestablishment 
libertarian leanings.

425
00:18:13,231 --> 00:18:17,250
Right now Corbin in the UK is much more 
of a socialist as much more of a of a of

426
00:18:17,251 --> 00:18:19,290
a prescriptive kind of guy,
but his supporters,

427
00:18:19,310 --> 00:18:20,143
you know,
want to be able to behave terribly and 

428
00:18:21,901 --> 00:18:22,734
they do behave terribly.
Just this week there was spitting on 

429
00:18:24,601 --> 00:18:26,730
people in the to the Tory conference in 
Manchester.

430
00:18:26,731 --> 00:18:27,564
They want the right not just to think 
terrible things like I'd microbes to 

431
00:18:30,120 --> 00:18:33,150
cultural image and they want to be the 
right to behave abominably.

432
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:35,080
All of this stuff,
you know,

433
00:18:35,130 --> 00:18:35,963
is,
is it comes from the thing I think 

434
00:18:38,340 --> 00:18:39,750
something we've all known for 10,
20 years.

435
00:18:39,751 --> 00:18:40,584
It's increasing dissatisfaction,
alienation from the political and media 

436
00:18:43,531 --> 00:18:46,380
relates that the lot of ordinary voters 
feel ordinary people.

437
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:50,400
I think pretty much everybody feels that
regardless of what they do and even,

438
00:18:50,490 --> 00:18:51,323
and I think we'll get onto this later,
even those of us who work in the media 

439
00:18:53,011 --> 00:18:55,500
and have quite nice lives and come from 
Nice homes and you know,

440
00:18:55,501 --> 00:18:56,880
and don't really have much to complain 
about.

441
00:18:56,881 --> 00:18:57,714
Still feel that quite acutely and you 
and I think are examples of people who 

442
00:19:00,541 --> 00:19:01,374
are a bit more alive to that.
A bit more aware of the fact that you 

443
00:19:05,580 --> 00:19:06,413
know,
that political discourse and cultural 

444
00:19:08,850 --> 00:19:10,770
discussion on television has become 
really,

445
00:19:10,771 --> 00:19:11,604
really dull.
And you've had people on your show 

446
00:19:13,051 --> 00:19:14,540
already and the first thing,
right?

447
00:19:14,580 --> 00:19:15,413
And you've had people in the old show 
and the first three episodes who are 

448
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:21,390
very insistent about free speech and 
free expression and the importance of,

449
00:19:21,450 --> 00:19:23,400
of old victorian style,
classical liberalism,

450
00:19:23,401 --> 00:19:24,234
but also the importance of mischief and 
joy and a little bit of fun like 

451
00:19:25,750 --> 00:19:26,350
marginal,
Eh,

452
00:19:26,350 --> 00:19:27,183
marginal monster you had on.
Sure it was a great lover of fun and 

453
00:19:28,681 --> 00:19:31,800
mischief and loves to tease people who 
want to lecture him and bullied him.

454
00:19:31,801 --> 00:19:34,470
And in the leftists who say to him that 
he's not a proper Muslim or whatever,

455
00:19:34,471 --> 00:19:36,510
you know,
because he doesn't want to pick women in

456
00:19:36,511 --> 00:19:38,130
Burkas or whatever it is.
Or what is this?

457
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:40,160
To me it seems racist if you say,
well,

458
00:19:40,161 --> 00:19:41,470
he's not being good enough.
Alright.

459
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:42,890
Racism.
But you see,

460
00:19:42,891 --> 00:19:44,050
we started with Gamergate.
We did.

461
00:19:44,060 --> 00:19:47,010
We see where we ended here.
This is what they hit us.

462
00:19:47,020 --> 00:19:48,990
And I'll tell you why.
Then bring it home.

463
00:19:49,040 --> 00:19:51,150
Typically the reasons.
Yeah,

464
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:51,280
it

465
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:52,290
does this,
this Gamergate is,

466
00:19:52,360 --> 00:19:54,580
is the sort of final,
um,

467
00:19:54,730 --> 00:19:57,970
it's almost like the final chapter in 
two decades worth of Internet wars.

468
00:19:58,140 --> 00:20:00,580
And those Internet wars have been about 
thought speech,

469
00:20:00,610 --> 00:20:01,630
culture,
politics.

470
00:20:01,660 --> 00:20:02,493
You name it,
every community on the Internet and 

471
00:20:04,661 --> 00:20:07,720
every sub community within those sites,
which for channel Reddit,

472
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:11,890
whatever has a dog in the fight and 
Gamergate because they all either have a

473
00:20:11,891 --> 00:20:12,724
vested interest in free speech and 
anonymity or they have an interest in 

474
00:20:14,801 --> 00:20:17,440
protecting the integrity,
integrity,

475
00:20:17,441 --> 00:20:20,240
and creative expression of certain 
attainment mediums or their,

476
00:20:20,241 --> 00:20:22,480
um,
their individual people who have behaved

477
00:20:22,481 --> 00:20:23,314
terribly on the Internet,
who saw Gamer Gate is a redemptive 

478
00:20:24,881 --> 00:20:26,980
opportunity.
So if they lined up with the,

479
00:20:26,981 --> 00:20:27,814
you know,
the women and went in with these mostly 

480
00:20:29,501 --> 00:20:32,290
fake frets about death and rape and all 
the rest of it.

481
00:20:32,490 --> 00:20:34,930
Um,
it typical leftist feminist tactics that

482
00:20:35,260 --> 00:20:36,770
don't stack up when you look into them 
move,

483
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:38,700
she will get into,
I'm going to challenge me.

484
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:43,870
A lining up on one side of that debate 
was a way of indicating whether you were

485
00:20:43,871 --> 00:20:44,704
for Authoritarians or libertarians.
And it was a sort of confluence of all 

486
00:20:46,781 --> 00:20:50,240
of these arguments and wars online and,
and,

487
00:20:50,241 --> 00:20:53,980
and it takes you in these crazy 
directions because in a way it's sort of

488
00:20:53,981 --> 00:20:54,814
the most all encompassing a war and the 
most all encompassing event that's ever 

489
00:20:58,181 --> 00:21:00,640
happened on the internet because it 
brought in everybody,

490
00:21:00,820 --> 00:21:02,200
all of the old battles,
you know,

491
00:21:02,201 --> 00:21:05,980
something people don't realize is when 
you range up the sides on Gamer Gate,

492
00:21:05,981 --> 00:21:08,860
there are people who were involved in 
was five years ago.

493
00:21:09,020 --> 00:21:10,720
You kind of take picking the same sorts 
of sides.

494
00:21:10,990 --> 00:21:11,823
This is a,
this is the best example we have yet 

495
00:21:13,451 --> 00:21:16,150
most exciting example.
Culturally we haven't journalists.

496
00:21:16,151 --> 00:21:16,984
There's on such a terrible idea,
terrible job of reporting on this 

497
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:20,590
concentrated these fake rape threats.

498
00:21:20,590 --> 00:21:23,590
Conservatives or miss the miss,
the huge cultural opportunity here.

499
00:21:23,780 --> 00:21:24,613
I'm shamefully so leftists have not even
bothered to make the arguments because 

500
00:21:28,091 --> 00:21:30,100
they know their arguments in nonsense 
and they focused on the threats.

501
00:21:30,340 --> 00:21:33,160
This was such an interesting example of 
what I was saying earlier,

502
00:21:33,340 --> 00:21:36,580
the fact that on the Internet that it's 
not about left and right anymore.

503
00:21:36,581 --> 00:21:37,414
It's about authoritarians and 
Libertarians and cultural libertarians 

504
00:21:39,761 --> 00:21:42,190
are the rising power,
and they're the people who love me.

505
00:21:42,191 --> 00:21:44,350
They're the people met.
I think much of your audience falls into

506
00:21:44,351 --> 00:21:45,184
the same bucket.
Actually,

507
00:21:45,410 --> 00:21:48,340
the people who love Lauren Southern,
the libertarian candidate,

508
00:21:48,370 --> 00:21:50,190
Canadian politician,
they love Cathy Young,

509
00:21:50,191 --> 00:21:51,024
a great veteran journalist of Christina 
Hoff summers at the American Enterprise 

510
00:21:52,870 --> 00:21:53,501
Institute.
Adam Baldwin,

511
00:21:53,501 --> 00:21:55,080
the actor,
but all of the,

512
00:21:55,240 --> 00:21:56,073
even Eli Roth,
a director is making a movie about 

513
00:21:58,241 --> 00:21:59,340
social justice,
where right now,

514
00:21:59,341 --> 00:22:00,174
you know,
um,

515
00:22:00,220 --> 00:22:01,053
cultural libertarianism is on the rise 
because people are sick of political 

516
00:22:02,771 --> 00:22:03,604
correctness.
People are sick of being told they're 

517
00:22:04,061 --> 00:22:04,721
racist,
sexist,

518
00:22:04,721 --> 00:22:06,340
misogynist,
transphobic when they know they're not.

519
00:22:06,830 --> 00:22:08,610
Once again,
I think by asking you about Gabriel,

520
00:22:08,630 --> 00:22:10,550
we just hit on a zillion.
We hit on a zillion.

521
00:22:11,100 --> 00:22:14,210
It's a huge topic.
That is the best I can do.

522
00:22:14,340 --> 00:22:15,620
All right,
so we're going to leave it there and I'm

523
00:22:15,621 --> 00:22:17,420
sure the commenters are going to have a 
field day with it,

524
00:22:17,421 --> 00:22:18,310
which is great.
So let,

525
00:22:18,350 --> 00:22:20,660
let's talk about some other stuff.
So feminism,

526
00:22:20,661 --> 00:22:23,000
which you've already enlightened me a 
bit on,

527
00:22:23,270 --> 00:22:26,900
you really,
really are against feminism.

528
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:31,920
And before I let you do your piece,
now my sense is that feminism,

529
00:22:32,421 --> 00:22:36,050
at least the way it started,
was that women wanted equality.

530
00:22:36,051 --> 00:22:39,170
They wanted the same equality of 
opportunity that men had.

531
00:22:39,171 --> 00:22:40,950
There is no doubt that,
uh,

532
00:22:41,030 --> 00:22:45,200
most of these roads in our society have 
been easier for men.

533
00:22:45,410 --> 00:22:47,680
I think you would argue that that's 
changed now.

534
00:22:48,470 --> 00:22:49,303
But so what,
what do you think of the feminist 

535
00:22:51,381 --> 00:22:52,214
movement?
You were just kicked out of the Amber 

536
00:22:52,970 --> 00:22:53,890
Rose sidewalk,
uh,

537
00:22:54,280 --> 00:22:56,400
two days ago.
He was in your situation with you today.

538
00:22:56,680 --> 00:22:58,850
We didn't run into him because he's 
given her a piece of my mind.

539
00:22:59,150 --> 00:23:00,890
Why would you hate feminists?

540
00:23:01,060 --> 00:23:01,893
Well,
the picture you painted perfectly 

541
00:23:02,681 --> 00:23:05,200
accurate,
or at least it was until perhaps 10,

542
00:23:05,350 --> 00:23:07,330
maybe 15 years ago.
Certainly recently.

543
00:23:07,420 --> 00:23:08,253
It's changed very recently.
I think most people instinctively agree 

544
00:23:10,971 --> 00:23:14,080
with the equality of opportunity.
And of course you have access for women.

545
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:16,060
They want women to have the opportunity 
to do anything.

546
00:23:16,061 --> 00:23:16,894
They want to rise as high as a man,
if they're prepared to work as hard and 

547
00:23:19,570 --> 00:23:21,670
put the same amount of hours in.
And of course I agree with that.

548
00:23:21,671 --> 00:23:22,504
I think everybody agrees with that.
That's not what modern intersectional 

549
00:23:25,391 --> 00:23:27,190
third wave as it's called feminism is 
about,

550
00:23:28,060 --> 00:23:30,550
which seems to me and I think to a lot 
of women,

551
00:23:30,551 --> 00:23:34,510
to primarily to be about man hating.
It is a very angry,

552
00:23:34,750 --> 00:23:38,500
bitter.
I'm a profane.

553
00:23:39,180 --> 00:23:41,170
I'm lesbian of feminism.

554
00:23:41,530 --> 00:23:43,470
No,
like right to be angry though.

555
00:23:43,471 --> 00:23:45,530
I mean as the other

556
00:23:46,510 --> 00:23:47,440
dinner,
an oppressed class.

557
00:23:48,210 --> 00:23:49,043
Well that women don't make equal money 
as men or is that a myth about this all 

558
00:23:55,761 --> 00:23:56,720
the time,
but of course it's a myth.

559
00:23:57,080 --> 00:23:58,580
It's one of those feminists missed that 
won't die.

560
00:23:58,630 --> 00:23:59,463
Basically.
If you take all of the earnings of men 

561
00:24:00,291 --> 00:24:02,390
and all of the earnings of women and you
do a simple bit of maths,

562
00:24:02,391 --> 00:24:04,670
then you'll get something like a 77.
What?

563
00:24:04,671 --> 00:24:07,100
This doesn't take into account as the 
different choices that women make.

564
00:24:07,130 --> 00:24:09,650
It doesn't take into account a variety 
of factors.

565
00:24:09,651 --> 00:24:12,140
No reputable economists takes the wage 
gap seriously,

566
00:24:12,560 --> 00:24:14,780
but it's repeated because,
um,

567
00:24:14,810 --> 00:24:16,410
you know,
I mean we still,

568
00:24:16,760 --> 00:24:19,930
we saw where the stuff comes from just 
this week for slut walk.

569
00:24:19,940 --> 00:24:20,773
I was kicked out of.
I'm a journalist for Time magazine 

570
00:24:23,511 --> 00:24:24,344
reported that 50,000
people that come out in support of the 

571
00:24:26,361 --> 00:24:27,560
slut walk,
I was there.

572
00:24:27,560 --> 00:24:30,830
It was like maybe 250.
She blathered she,

573
00:24:30,950 --> 00:24:31,783
you know,
started to sort of blame other people 

574
00:24:33,891 --> 00:24:35,540
and eventually they changed it to 
thousands,

575
00:24:35,541 --> 00:24:36,374
but it was still wrong.
This sort of like sloppy ideological 

576
00:24:39,441 --> 00:24:40,274
reporting.
And I'm sorry to say that the most 

577
00:24:41,391 --> 00:24:44,000
brazen untruths always come from the 
left.

578
00:24:44,660 --> 00:24:47,210
Just like most of the major plagiarism 
scandals come from the left because they

579
00:24:47,211 --> 00:24:50,000
believe in narrative over fact.
This is how rollingstone happened.

580
00:24:50,270 --> 00:24:50,751
Um,
you know,

581
00:24:50,751 --> 00:24:51,570
the,
the,

582
00:24:51,570 --> 00:24:53,840
the fake rape in rolling stone,
it's our Duke Lacrosse happens.

583
00:24:53,841 --> 00:24:54,674
It's how,
you know,

584
00:24:54,680 --> 00:24:57,320
all of these things happen because these
liberal journalists believe that even if

585
00:24:57,321 --> 00:24:58,154
this one's not true,
it's really important for us to talk 

586
00:24:58,881 --> 00:24:59,714
about.
So I'm with you on that because even 

587
00:25:00,471 --> 00:25:03,230
with some of my prior guests like Sam 
and budget,

588
00:25:03,560 --> 00:25:05,370
this is what they've done is what they 
experience,

589
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:07,760
you know,
and they're getting the receiving end of

590
00:25:07,761 --> 00:25:08,370
it.

591
00:25:08,370 --> 00:25:09,590
Um,
you know,

592
00:25:09,660 --> 00:25:10,310
the,
the,

593
00:25:10,310 --> 00:25:11,920
these,
these memes of like,

594
00:25:11,950 --> 00:25:12,800
you know,
there's foot,

595
00:25:12,801 --> 00:25:14,720
whether it's three,
four or five women,

596
00:25:16,250 --> 00:25:17,270
one in three,
one in four,

597
00:25:17,271 --> 00:25:19,790
one in five women are going to get 
sexually assaulted on campus,

598
00:25:19,791 --> 00:25:21,940
which is just nonsense.
Whether it's the wage gap,

599
00:25:21,941 --> 00:25:23,990
which is nonsense,
you know,

600
00:25:23,991 --> 00:25:26,210
these things become established as part 
of almost almost.

601
00:25:26,211 --> 00:25:30,230
They won't become almost folkloric and 
look right up to the president.

602
00:25:30,231 --> 00:25:31,760
I mean Obama repeat some of these 
statistics,

603
00:25:31,761 --> 00:25:34,340
but they're not true.
And if you look at the work,

604
00:25:34,341 --> 00:25:35,174
for example,
Christina Hoff summers I mentioned 

605
00:25:35,661 --> 00:25:37,430
earlier,
the American Enterprise Institute who to

606
00:25:37,460 --> 00:25:38,293
very crisply and cleanly and 
entertainingly debunks this stuff I'm 

607
00:25:41,970 --> 00:25:44,420
working on getting well,
she's great and you should,

608
00:25:44,421 --> 00:25:45,254
I mean she's,
she takes a scalpel to these guys and 

609
00:25:46,581 --> 00:25:49,070
it's,
it's clinical and brilliant to watch it.

610
00:25:49,820 --> 00:25:50,653
None of this stuff stacks up.
So if you're trying to make the case 

611
00:25:52,821 --> 00:25:53,654
that women have a right to be angry,
that they should be angry because women 

612
00:25:56,331 --> 00:25:59,210
have all of these injustices will ask 
you what are these injustices?

613
00:25:59,210 --> 00:26:01,010
And every single one that's given by 
feminist,

614
00:26:01,011 --> 00:26:03,200
every example,
it's giving me a feminist does not stand

615
00:26:03,201 --> 00:26:04,034
up to scrutiny.
Women are not an oppressed class in the 

616
00:26:05,871 --> 00:26:08,270
west.
There is no rape culture in the West.

617
00:26:08,450 --> 00:26:10,730
We don't celebrate rapists.
We put them in prison.

618
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:12,740
Women don't earn less than men for the 
same work.

619
00:26:12,770 --> 00:26:14,630
That's illegal.
It is true that you know,

620
00:26:14,631 --> 00:26:16,850
because women are mothers.
There are consequences when it,

621
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:17,713
when you get into the workplace on that.
But a woman is paid the same work as a 

622
00:26:19,671 --> 00:26:20,620
man.
So when you,

623
00:26:20,630 --> 00:26:21,463
when you,
when you say there's a way this 

624
00:26:22,731 --> 00:26:24,280
confusion between wages and earnings,
you know,

625
00:26:24,890 --> 00:26:26,420
when you say seventy cents to the 
dollar,

626
00:26:26,421 --> 00:26:27,800
what women here is,
well,

627
00:26:27,801 --> 00:26:29,930
I'm going to get page seventy seven 
cents for a man's pound.

628
00:26:30,020 --> 00:26:31,880
No woman has that experience.
It doesn't happen.

629
00:26:32,030 --> 00:26:32,863
You know,
there's some women who work part time 

630
00:26:33,411 --> 00:26:34,100
because they have children.

631
00:26:34,100 --> 00:26:34,731
Well,
they have children.

632
00:26:34,731 --> 00:26:35,690
What do you expect?
You know,

633
00:26:36,710 --> 00:26:37,543
the important thing is that we make sure
that when women come back to work after 

634
00:26:39,291 --> 00:26:41,300
they have children,
that they're not disadvantaged for that.

635
00:26:41,390 --> 00:26:42,980
Now where that's happening,
that's wrong.

636
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:44,033
But it is not,
it is not a problem on the scale of 

637
00:26:46,471 --> 00:26:47,400
what,
uh,

638
00:26:47,540 --> 00:26:49,980
you know,
Sam Harris and Majid we'll talk about,

639
00:26:50,010 --> 00:26:50,843
you know,
happening to women in the Middle East 

640
00:26:51,990 --> 00:26:52,823
and feminists will never talk to you 
about this difficult stuff because they 

641
00:26:54,601 --> 00:26:57,390
don't want to be,
they don't want to be put in a difficult

642
00:26:57,391 --> 00:26:59,340
position of having to rank Islam versus 
women.

643
00:26:59,460 --> 00:27:00,121
Right?
So that,

644
00:27:00,121 --> 00:27:03,500
that's where I'm western Western world.
It's a western union,

645
00:27:03,550 --> 00:27:04,383
western world western feminism 
complaining about manspreading 

646
00:27:06,970 --> 00:27:08,920
mansplaining,
this constant,

647
00:27:09,700 --> 00:27:14,440
this constant message that men are evil 
and broken and wrong,

648
00:27:14,470 --> 00:27:17,110
toxic masculinity.
This is offensive.

649
00:27:17,350 --> 00:27:19,600
It's irritating,
it is wrong.

650
00:27:19,750 --> 00:27:20,583
And it's district.

651
00:27:20,620 --> 00:27:21,151
All right,
so let's,

652
00:27:21,151 --> 00:27:22,580
let's go right to that.
Um,

653
00:27:22,820 --> 00:27:26,220
you wrote a piece this week about this,
about the shooter in Oregon,

654
00:27:26,680 --> 00:27:31,230
and your,
your piece basically was saying that men

655
00:27:31,231 --> 00:27:36,231
are being abused in the media or so are 
so easily dismissed in society,

656
00:27:38,060 --> 00:27:38,920
uh,
that,

657
00:27:39,080 --> 00:27:39,913
that they're acting out in crazy ways.
And we have to stop treating men like I 

658
00:27:44,040 --> 00:27:44,873
know.
And I know a lot of people on the left 

659
00:27:45,451 --> 00:27:47,970
for a lot of the reasons you're 
describing will read something like that

660
00:27:47,971 --> 00:27:49,250
and say,
you know,

661
00:27:49,260 --> 00:27:51,780
this is nonsense men.
Men have all the power.

662
00:27:52,220 --> 00:27:53,053
Yeah.
I mean what I said was that it at least 

663
00:27:55,591 --> 00:27:56,424
part of the reason that some of these 
young men are acting out that we have 

664
00:27:58,711 --> 00:27:59,544
these shootings,
these shootings happening at least some 

665
00:28:01,021 --> 00:28:03,660
of the reason for that is the horrible 
position we've put men in.

666
00:28:04,260 --> 00:28:07,530
Now you can read everyday and major new 
media publications,

667
00:28:07,610 --> 00:28:09,090
um,
that,

668
00:28:09,150 --> 00:28:09,980
um,
there is a,

669
00:28:09,980 --> 00:28:10,813
there is a problem intrinsically with 
being a straight white male or just 

670
00:28:12,721 --> 00:28:14,050
being a white man,
um,

671
00:28:14,300 --> 00:28:15,133
that somehow that gives you privileged 
access to certain institutions that you 

672
00:28:17,761 --> 00:28:18,594
are somehow problematic.
That's not the experience of young men 

673
00:28:22,110 --> 00:28:26,420
today who go through university.
And our one in seven of them is,

674
00:28:26,430 --> 00:28:29,880
it were put on Ritalin or adderall 
because they are held up to a female.

675
00:28:29,881 --> 00:28:33,460
But a female behavior standards.
It's not the experience of boys.

676
00:28:33,780 --> 00:28:37,640
There's a direct connection between the 
medication and the and this.

677
00:28:37,920 --> 00:28:38,730
Well,
of course there is,

678
00:28:38,730 --> 00:28:39,563
of course,
of course there is a behavior not be 

679
00:28:41,251 --> 00:28:42,084
upstanders babies standards.
Of course there is because behavior has 

680
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:45,300
done,
I'm,

681
00:28:45,300 --> 00:28:46,390
I,
I meant behavior,

682
00:28:46,870 --> 00:28:48,400
behavior standards.
Um,

683
00:28:48,510 --> 00:28:49,343
and we're not just doing that,
but we're also changing the way the 

684
00:28:50,761 --> 00:28:51,594
exams are mark,
to make them easier for women because 

685
00:28:52,801 --> 00:28:55,200
women don't test well and exams.
So boys are struggling,

686
00:28:55,201 --> 00:28:57,390
boys are falling behind.
And this is not a controversial thing.

687
00:28:57,391 --> 00:29:00,150
Everybody knows this boy's are falling 
horribly behind girls in education.

688
00:29:00,330 --> 00:29:01,163
Fewer men are going to the university,
more women graduate when we get higher 

689
00:29:03,211 --> 00:29:04,920
grades in the workplace.
For example,

690
00:29:04,921 --> 00:29:05,754
Cornell study from 2015 showed that 
women who have a two to one advantage 

691
00:29:09,001 --> 00:29:11,400
going for the same job just because 
everybody's desperate to hire women.

692
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:15,680
The experiences of men growing up now do
not reflect these horrible headlines,

693
00:29:15,681 --> 00:29:17,370
um,
about straight white men.

694
00:29:17,371 --> 00:29:19,650
And frankly,
I think progressives have got themselves

695
00:29:19,651 --> 00:29:20,484
into a really weird corner.
They don't seem to appreciate the irony 

696
00:29:22,381 --> 00:29:25,080
of criticizing somebody for their skin 
color and their orientation,

697
00:29:25,081 --> 00:29:25,760
but they do it anyway,

698
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:27,080
right?
And they would say,

699
00:29:27,081 --> 00:29:28,970
well,
this is the group that's in power.

700
00:29:28,971 --> 00:29:31,050
So if they're being well,
they would say yes,

701
00:29:31,430 --> 00:29:32,263
the only claim that there is a sort of 
mystical force in society known as the 

702
00:29:35,631 --> 00:29:36,464
patriarchy.
And what these feminists will claim is 

703
00:29:38,181 --> 00:29:39,014
that the patriarchy is responsible for 
keeping women down and all of these 

704
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:46,420
crazy expressions like toxic message in 
whatever flow from this,

705
00:29:46,510 --> 00:29:49,380
this tired old ideology,
um,

706
00:29:49,420 --> 00:29:53,920
about male power and an overseas.
Now,

707
00:29:53,921 --> 00:29:56,380
as Camille Paleo,
that wonderful dissident feminist critic

708
00:29:56,381 --> 00:29:56,801
says,
you know,

709
00:29:56,801 --> 00:29:58,600
if society but left in the left in the 
hands of women,

710
00:29:58,601 --> 00:29:59,434
we'd still be living in mud huts.
Thank God for the Patriarchy Patriarchy 

711
00:30:01,721 --> 00:30:02,554
that got us to the moon.
It's the patriarchy to built the 

712
00:30:03,251 --> 00:30:04,900
Internet,
the patriarchy that built this floor and

713
00:30:04,901 --> 00:30:07,960
the ceiling women didn't want to do that
is the patriarchy that drives oil trucks

714
00:30:07,961 --> 00:30:09,010
in a steeple jacks.
You know,

715
00:30:09,011 --> 00:30:10,210
women don't want to do that stuff 
either.

716
00:30:10,510 --> 00:30:11,343
We're perfectly happy to complain about 
gender representation when there aren't 

717
00:30:15,791 --> 00:30:16,610
enough women,
when,

718
00:30:16,610 --> 00:30:17,443
when there aren't enough women in a,
in a particular subject field for our 

719
00:30:19,811 --> 00:30:20,644
arbitrary quotas.
But we don't make it the same complaint 

720
00:30:22,211 --> 00:30:22,890
the other way around,

721
00:30:22,890 --> 00:30:23,980
right?
But all of this stuff,

722
00:30:24,150 --> 00:30:24,983
we're the ones that were going out and 
hunting and women were taking care of 

723
00:30:27,661 --> 00:30:28,494
the home.
So I find that argument is a little 

724
00:30:29,521 --> 00:30:30,354
flimsy because

725
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:33,230
are there are people who say that's not 
a bad way to structure society.

726
00:30:33,231 --> 00:30:35,450
I mean when we start to break down those
gender.

727
00:30:35,480 --> 00:30:36,313
Look,
this all comes from this sort of 

728
00:30:37,280 --> 00:30:38,113
credited leftest idea that gender is 
socially constructed and agenda is 

729
00:30:41,111 --> 00:30:42,140
socially constructed,
right?

730
00:30:42,141 --> 00:30:44,630
If you're taught to be a boy or taught 
to be a girl,

731
00:30:44,660 --> 00:30:46,670
rather than having a lot of that 
behavior,

732
00:30:46,671 --> 00:30:49,640
genetic behavior sort of encoded in you,
if you like,

733
00:30:49,641 --> 00:30:51,980
as a virtue by virtue of your 
chromosomes,

734
00:30:52,820 --> 00:30:53,641
if you,
if,

735
00:30:53,641 --> 00:30:56,480
if gender is a performance and it's a 
social construct,

736
00:30:56,660 --> 00:30:59,180
there's no reason why girls compared to 
boys and boys can't behave like girls.

737
00:30:59,181 --> 00:31:01,100
Now we're beginning to start to see that
fall apart.

738
00:31:01,101 --> 00:31:01,934
Now,
one of the ways in which it falls apart 

739
00:31:02,571 --> 00:31:04,640
as the transgender debate,
we know now,

740
00:31:04,670 --> 00:31:07,040
now progressives are telling us the baby
can be born with the wrong brain.

741
00:31:07,100 --> 00:31:07,933
Um,
if you could be born with a female 

742
00:31:08,541 --> 00:31:09,374
brain,
there must be such a thing as a female 

743
00:31:10,011 --> 00:31:10,844
brain.
So surely femininity can't be as a copy 

744
00:31:12,410 --> 00:31:14,570
of social construct.
Make your bloody mine's up.

745
00:31:15,480 --> 00:31:18,420
The thing that you see on this was that,
you know,

746
00:31:18,450 --> 00:31:19,283
everybody was saying that Abi or most 
sane people I think were saying that 

747
00:31:22,021 --> 00:31:25,290
obviously Rachel Dolezal couldn't choose
to be black.

748
00:31:25,291 --> 00:31:26,870
She was white and she pretended

749
00:31:28,180 --> 00:31:29,013
created by progressive.
So you said that blackness was a 

750
00:31:30,671 --> 00:31:31,504
performance that you could,
that blackness was a social construct 

751
00:31:34,360 --> 00:31:36,700
that race was.
Now that rat race is a social construct.

752
00:31:36,701 --> 00:31:38,160
Of course it isn't,
you know,

753
00:31:38,410 --> 00:31:41,530
we know now because we have the computer
processing power to do it.

754
00:31:41,531 --> 00:31:42,460
We know that the,
you know,

755
00:31:42,461 --> 00:31:45,790
when we look at the genome,
that there are clusters of clusters of,

756
00:31:45,820 --> 00:31:46,653
of information that map onto certain 
geographies in that's in that 

757
00:31:49,160 --> 00:31:51,520
statistical sense.
We know now that race is real.

758
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:52,730
Um,
and you know,

759
00:31:52,750 --> 00:31:57,070
we know from ordinary people know from 
common sense of our eyes and ears,

760
00:31:57,100 --> 00:31:57,933
you know,
we know that people look different and 

761
00:31:58,811 --> 00:32:00,640
behave differently.
Um,

762
00:32:00,700 --> 00:32:04,570
we know that stuff,
but progressives for Mr,

763
00:32:04,900 --> 00:32:05,733
variety of barmy reasons,
best known to themselves have been 

764
00:32:07,780 --> 00:32:10,120
claiming that's gender and race are 
social constructs.

765
00:32:10,150 --> 00:32:11,740
All this stuff is starting to fall apart
now.

766
00:32:12,910 --> 00:32:15,490
Is the gender one falling part?
I don't want to Belabor this point,

767
00:32:15,491 --> 00:32:18,560
but the gentleman's fully believe that 
people can be trans because I,

768
00:32:18,561 --> 00:32:20,770
I know,
I know some trans people.

769
00:32:20,771 --> 00:32:21,604
I have no doubt

770
00:32:21,610 --> 00:32:23,050
I didn't say that.
I want to say what I said.

771
00:32:23,490 --> 00:32:24,323
What I said was I'm transgender debate 
is very interesting and very dangerous 

772
00:32:27,821 --> 00:32:29,770
for progressives and they haven't yet 
dealt with this.

773
00:32:29,980 --> 00:32:32,440
Um,
if you can be born with the wrong brain,

774
00:32:32,940 --> 00:32:33,773
if you can be born,
if you can be born a man with a woman's 

775
00:32:36,221 --> 00:32:37,054
brain,
that means is such a thing as a woman's 

776
00:32:38,141 --> 00:32:38,974
brain.
Right?

777
00:32:39,140 --> 00:32:39,973
So what,
what transgender patients will do is 

778
00:32:41,211 --> 00:32:43,690
they start hacking away at themselves to
make them,

779
00:32:43,990 --> 00:32:44,823
you know,
and it's an anatomically more like 

780
00:32:45,801 --> 00:32:46,634
women.
So they're somewhere between the two 

781
00:32:49,461 --> 00:32:50,390
genders,
by the end of it,

782
00:32:50,450 --> 00:32:51,860
right?
And they're not functioning women,

783
00:32:51,890 --> 00:32:54,170
but they look a bit more like women.
Um,

784
00:32:54,260 --> 00:32:55,093
and some of their,
some things work a bit more like women 

785
00:32:58,500 --> 00:33:00,980
and they have the appearance of women 
and they say they have a woman's brain.

786
00:33:01,300 --> 00:33:02,360
If you're gonna have a woman's brain.

787
00:33:02,360 --> 00:33:03,193
There is such a thing as a woman's brain
is there's a biological basis for 

788
00:33:04,731 --> 00:33:07,550
certain behavioral differences.
Now you were asking me about sort of men

789
00:33:07,551 --> 00:33:11,740
going out to forage may not maybe no bad
thing that we let men be career,

790
00:33:11,790 --> 00:33:12,623
you know,
be the hunter gatherers and women may 

791
00:33:15,321 --> 00:33:17,240
indeed be happier focusing on bringing 
up,

792
00:33:17,630 --> 00:33:19,340
bringing up children and building a 
home.

793
00:33:19,550 --> 00:33:22,520
Certainly the women that I know that are
in their twenties that have been told,

794
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:25,400
especially in their thirties,
have been told they can have it all.

795
00:33:25,401 --> 00:33:27,440
They can have a career.
They're living in a horrible apartment.

796
00:33:27,441 --> 00:33:28,274
They don't live with a cat.
They're miserable or hay or their 

797
00:33:29,271 --> 00:33:30,590
friends.
They're not happy people.

798
00:33:30,860 --> 00:33:31,693
They've been encouraged to be single,
encouraged by feminism particularly to 

799
00:33:34,221 --> 00:33:35,670
look how they want it.
So this,

800
00:33:35,750 --> 00:33:37,760
this fat,
but fat positivity.

801
00:33:37,761 --> 00:33:38,594
That is another feminist trope is that 
you can look like what you want their 

802
00:33:40,491 --> 00:33:43,190
self esteem shouldn't depend on what a 
man thinks of you.

803
00:33:43,820 --> 00:33:44,241
Well,
yes,

804
00:33:44,241 --> 00:33:45,950
it should because if you want to,
you know,

805
00:33:46,190 --> 00:33:48,320
if you want to settle down with a 
manual,

806
00:33:48,321 --> 00:33:49,790
like,
and have a nice happy life.

807
00:33:49,791 --> 00:33:52,220
There are certain things that men liking
women like stay thin.

808
00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:52,911
Um,
you know,

809
00:33:52,911 --> 00:33:54,290
and you may not like it,
but it's a fact.

810
00:33:54,680 --> 00:33:55,513
As gay men,
we know that men are visual animals 

811
00:33:56,991 --> 00:33:57,950
right now.
Some,

812
00:33:58,010 --> 00:33:59,930
some guys like fat girls,
but not many.

813
00:34:00,040 --> 00:34:00,660
Um,
and if,

814
00:34:00,660 --> 00:34:01,493
if you,
if you're listening to feminists who 

815
00:34:02,301 --> 00:34:03,134
were telling you can grow blue armpit 
hair and you can burp and Fart and 

816
00:34:06,561 --> 00:34:07,910
swear,
you can be Lena Dunham,

817
00:34:07,911 --> 00:34:09,200
this disgusting,
quivering,

818
00:34:09,201 --> 00:34:10,540
massive horror.
Um,

819
00:34:10,600 --> 00:34:11,900
you know,
and men will like you.

820
00:34:11,960 --> 00:34:12,793
That's a lie,
will not like you and you'll be alone 

821
00:34:15,171 --> 00:34:17,540
and you'll be miserable.
I know a lot of people here are going to

822
00:34:17,541 --> 00:34:17,961
say,
well,

823
00:34:17,961 --> 00:34:18,794
this is sort of somehow this is some of 
your gay rage or misogyny coming out in 

824
00:34:22,371 --> 00:34:23,160
some of this stuff.

825
00:34:23,160 --> 00:34:25,010
So let's say I don't have a dog in the 
fight,

826
00:34:25,011 --> 00:34:26,810
I don't care.
I don't care.

827
00:34:26,930 --> 00:34:28,520
I don't care if you're thin or fat as a 
woman,

828
00:34:28,521 --> 00:34:29,354
I don't want to fuck you either way.
I don't care what I want is for people 

829
00:34:32,541 --> 00:34:33,374
to be happy and I see people not being 
happy because I see that women are 

830
00:34:35,601 --> 00:34:38,000
moving in a very,
very dangerous direction.

831
00:34:38,001 --> 00:34:43,001
Told lies by Wacky fall f feminist 
crazies who want to control other people

832
00:34:43,221 --> 00:34:44,054
because they're hurting inside.
I think in many cases very often it's 

833
00:34:46,821 --> 00:34:47,654
30,
40 year old bitter old woman trying to 

834
00:34:48,950 --> 00:34:50,810
lecture 20 year old girls on how to 
behave.

835
00:34:51,020 --> 00:34:55,970
It's an ugly woman on woman form of 
violence if you like a modern feminism.

836
00:34:55,971 --> 00:34:56,804
It is a nasty thing to watch.
And I see women get drawn into this and 

837
00:35:00,591 --> 00:35:01,424
I find it sad.
But there is of course one great hope 

838
00:35:05,270 --> 00:35:07,190
and,
and a silver lining to all this,

839
00:35:07,191 --> 00:35:08,400
which is that,
um,

840
00:35:08,730 --> 00:35:11,210
feminism is collapsing in popularity 
among women.

841
00:35:11,560 --> 00:35:13,190
Um,
in just a few years.

842
00:35:13,191 --> 00:35:14,024
The number of American women who 
described themselves as feminist has 

843
00:35:15,291 --> 00:35:16,124
gone from 28 to 18 percent.
You can read in Vox is not somewhere 

844
00:35:18,441 --> 00:35:19,274
that would advertise.
This may just be because of the success 

845
00:35:21,921 --> 00:35:22,754
of the movement.
Women who don't identify as feminists 

846
00:35:25,641 --> 00:35:29,270
and they don't identify as feminists 
because they see in feminism or IC,

847
00:35:29,360 --> 00:35:32,300
which is turned into a bitter,
nasty,

848
00:35:32,360 --> 00:35:33,193
ugly man hating empty horror show and 
frankly you read these blogs like 

849
00:35:38,131 --> 00:35:41,140
Jenzabar,
which you know which a rail against men.

850
00:35:41,160 --> 00:35:41,993
Most women don't hate men.
Most women don't want to beat up on 

851
00:35:44,161 --> 00:35:46,440
people for being straight or being white
or being a male.

852
00:35:46,650 --> 00:35:48,390
Most people quite like a boyfriend,
you know,

853
00:35:48,540 --> 00:35:49,373
so they see it.
They don't have anything in common with 

854
00:35:50,641 --> 00:35:51,474
these angry gender warriors who want to 
deny basic human nature and who make 

855
00:35:54,810 --> 00:35:57,930
claims and give instructions that are 
almost designed to make women miserable.

856
00:35:58,110 --> 00:35:58,943
And I think most women recognize that,
which is why feminism is falling off a 

857
00:36:01,351 --> 00:36:02,250
cliff with women.

858
00:36:02,280 --> 00:36:04,570
I love how you wrap up.
Even the things I disagree with in the,

859
00:36:04,580 --> 00:36:07,410
in the social justice warrior prism,
because that's my.

860
00:36:07,650 --> 00:36:08,483
That's my weak spot because I'm so 
against that that I have to sort of 

861
00:36:10,621 --> 00:36:12,480
acknowledge some of what you're saying 
here.

862
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:13,291
Um,
all right.

863
00:36:13,291 --> 00:36:14,640
So let's,
let's do one more thing and then I,

864
00:36:14,641 --> 00:36:16,670
and then I want to spend the whole 
second half of this really on,

865
00:36:16,671 --> 00:36:20,310
on one topic specifically,
and I want to talk about atheism because

866
00:36:21,090 --> 00:36:23,280
it's been one of the so boring.
All right?

867
00:36:23,310 --> 00:36:27,030
So just a couple of people wrong in a 
room being very angry on the Internet.

868
00:36:27,090 --> 00:36:29,010
So you don't,
you,

869
00:36:29,011 --> 00:36:29,844
I sense,
you almost think that atheists don't 

870
00:36:31,051 --> 00:36:31,884
exist,

871
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:34,650
that there's some lesbians don't exist.
They're already.

872
00:36:34,710 --> 00:36:36,300
Unfortunately there are.
They're going to force you.

873
00:36:36,301 --> 00:36:37,570
There are.
So there are a,

874
00:36:37,600 --> 00:36:40,800
you acknowledged that there are lots of 
wrong people in the world,

875
00:36:40,801 --> 00:36:41,634
you know,
and one of the wrong kinds of wrong 

876
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:45,530
people are atheists.
Now the thing I find fun about it,

877
00:36:45,550 --> 00:36:48,330
I didn't really care if somebody 
believes in God and I hope they do.

878
00:36:48,331 --> 00:36:49,164
I wish they did because I know it'd be 
quite nice if they join me up there in 

879
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:54,690
40 slash 50 years,
but there's something up there.

880
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:58,200
I've got a first class ticket.
She loves me.

881
00:36:59,070 --> 00:37:00,840
I'm very confident.
There's nothing up there.

882
00:37:00,841 --> 00:37:03,630
There's a lighting grid have been built 
by men.

883
00:37:05,080 --> 00:37:06,370
Uh,
no,

884
00:37:06,450 --> 00:37:08,490
but I mean,
the reason I.

885
00:37:08,500 --> 00:37:11,310
The reason I haven't go atheists because
it's fun because they're so thin skin.

886
00:37:11,311 --> 00:37:12,144
They're like,
come.

887
00:37:12,330 --> 00:37:13,163
They're like libertarians or they're 
like cyclists or Liberal Democrats in 

888
00:37:15,991 --> 00:37:19,210
the UK or you know,
any other sort of feminists.

889
00:37:19,230 --> 00:37:21,780
In fact,
they're so easy to wind up.

890
00:37:21,781 --> 00:37:22,614
I mean,
you know how many atheists it takes to 

891
00:37:23,841 --> 00:37:26,220
change a light bulb and before you've 
even given the punchline,

892
00:37:26,340 --> 00:37:29,640
people are furious and there's a reddit 
thread about it and they're just so much

893
00:37:29,641 --> 00:37:29,810
fun.

894
00:37:29,810 --> 00:37:30,643
I understand.
But why will you be going after the 

895
00:37:31,431 --> 00:37:32,900
people that it's easy to go after?
I mean,

896
00:37:32,901 --> 00:37:35,020
every poll shows that the most hated

897
00:37:35,120 --> 00:37:39,290
my in the country.
People would know these victims.

898
00:37:39,510 --> 00:37:40,343
These,
these people have some of the most 

899
00:37:41,041 --> 00:37:42,750
celebrated public intellectuals on their
side.

900
00:37:42,751 --> 00:37:43,584
Richard Dawkins,
the late Christopher Christopher 

901
00:37:44,580 --> 00:37:45,413
hitchens.
These people have huge public 

902
00:37:46,741 --> 00:37:47,970
intellectuals on their side.
Millet,

903
00:37:48,120 --> 00:37:49,170
militant atheism,
if you'd like.

904
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:50,640
If he is Mr trendiest thing in the 
world.

905
00:37:50,850 --> 00:37:53,130
Every journalist is an atheist.
Everybody in the media,

906
00:37:53,131 --> 00:37:53,921
as an atheist,
you know,

907
00:37:53,921 --> 00:37:54,754
you're never going to get somebody laugh
at you or look at you weirdly for 

908
00:37:57,151 --> 00:37:57,984
announcing you're an atheist,
you announced you're a Christian or a 

909
00:37:59,311 --> 00:38:02,590
Muslim or if or maybe especially a Jew.
Um,

910
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:04,290
you know,
all sorts of bad things happen to you,

911
00:38:04,291 --> 00:38:05,310
right?
Nobody,

912
00:38:05,670 --> 00:38:08,880
nobody looks at you funny except me.
I'm probably one person.

913
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:10,440
If you announced that you were an 
atheist,

914
00:38:10,441 --> 00:38:13,950
so don't be that victim because if you 
know this is,

915
00:38:14,040 --> 00:38:14,873
this is the,
this is a privileged group in society 

916
00:38:16,231 --> 00:38:20,520
that I find it funny to take the Mickey 
out of because they are so touchy.

917
00:38:20,690 --> 00:38:21,523
This is interesting because.
So when you were talking about 

918
00:38:22,971 --> 00:38:24,980
Gamergate,
part of what you liked is that there was

919
00:38:24,981 --> 00:38:26,840
this groundswell coming up from the 
bottom,

920
00:38:26,841 --> 00:38:27,674
fighting this authoritarian sense.
I think religion people have that again 

921
00:38:29,991 --> 00:38:32,420
now,
but I don't think we're there yet.

922
00:38:32,421 --> 00:38:34,310
I,
I get that angle and this is what all my

923
00:38:34,550 --> 00:38:36,040
friends on the say,
that

924
00:38:36,040 --> 00:38:38,980
the bridge is now are the ones being 
oppressed and Christians are being.

925
00:38:39,010 --> 00:38:42,120
I wouldn't go so far as to say 
oppressed,

926
00:38:42,180 --> 00:38:45,550
but saying it's basically crazy as is 
wrong.

927
00:38:45,880 --> 00:38:46,713
I wouldn't go as far as to say 
Christians are an oppressed class in 

928
00:38:48,131 --> 00:38:48,964
this country because I don't think there
aren't many press clusters in this 

929
00:38:50,141 --> 00:38:52,100
country.
I can't do anything.

930
00:38:52,310 --> 00:38:54,100
Know,
maybe black people still.

931
00:38:54,220 --> 00:38:55,600
That's probably the only one in this 
country.

932
00:38:55,930 --> 00:38:56,763
Um,
I don't think they're an oppressed 

933
00:38:57,791 --> 00:38:59,410
class,
but I do think,

934
00:38:59,490 --> 00:39:02,710
um,
I've been very ashamed of my fellow,

935
00:39:02,740 --> 00:39:03,573
my fellow homosexuals in the way they 
have behaved toward Christians in some 

936
00:39:05,861 --> 00:39:07,420
of the media circus that happened 
recently.

937
00:39:07,421 --> 00:39:09,460
I have so I can,
I can go with you on that.

938
00:39:09,461 --> 00:39:10,660
Plead,
plead deeply,

939
00:39:10,661 --> 00:39:11,494
horrifying to watch gay people treat 
Christians as gays were treated for 

940
00:39:14,830 --> 00:39:16,310
barely two decades ago.
Sure.

941
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:18,730
So,
but I do think there's some value there,

942
00:39:18,760 --> 00:39:19,210
but I do.

943
00:39:19,210 --> 00:39:20,043
I have noticed I did a David Webb who's 
going to be a guest on our show in a 

944
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:24,460
couple weeks from Fox News and on Sirius
Xm.

945
00:39:24,580 --> 00:39:25,413
I was on his show when gay marriage was,
was being passed by the Supreme Court 

946
00:39:28,811 --> 00:39:32,500
and the law was being struck down to 
shame is shame and we'll get to that too

947
00:39:32,501 --> 00:39:34,990
in a second,
but what he said to me,

948
00:39:35,020 --> 00:39:37,600
it just literally,
I think it was the first day was the day

949
00:39:37,601 --> 00:39:41,440
that had happened was that we should 
really already start being a.

950
00:39:41,560 --> 00:39:42,393
We should start policing the gaze to 
make sure we don't start pressing 

951
00:39:45,191 --> 00:39:46,330
Christian,
but isn't that.

952
00:39:46,780 --> 00:39:47,613
Don't we have to give it a little time?
Don't we have to let gays have a little 

953
00:39:50,441 --> 00:39:54,340
time to work with to be bullied someone 
before suddenly accusing them?

954
00:39:54,341 --> 00:39:54,500
No,
no,

955
00:39:54,500 --> 00:39:57,010
no.
We don't need to give gay people anytime

956
00:39:57,011 --> 00:39:58,680
to be bullies.
They have shown and this is a,

957
00:39:58,710 --> 00:39:59,650
this is what you are.

958
00:39:59,660 --> 00:40:01,510
This is something that I always find 
interesting about people,

959
00:40:01,511 --> 00:40:03,910
how they behave when they enter the 
corridors of power,

960
00:40:04,150 --> 00:40:04,983
how people behave when they are granted 
the status that they have asked for for 

961
00:40:07,721 --> 00:40:10,360
so long when gays are finally not just 
equal in society,

962
00:40:10,361 --> 00:40:13,180
but held up as models of paragons of 
virtue.

963
00:40:13,181 --> 00:40:13,720
I mean,
you read it,

964
00:40:13,720 --> 00:40:14,800
you read Gawker,
buzzfeed,

965
00:40:14,801 --> 00:40:17,380
you would think they'd be engaged with 
some kind of moral objective,

966
00:40:17,590 --> 00:40:18,423
but being gay with someone so you know,
it was better than being straight in 

967
00:40:20,501 --> 00:40:21,334
some way.
Um,

968
00:40:21,360 --> 00:40:22,390
you know,
I'm not gonna say,

969
00:40:22,391 --> 00:40:23,051
well,
we'll,

970
00:40:23,051 --> 00:40:23,884
we'll,
we'll perhaps discuss it in the second 

971
00:40:24,311 --> 00:40:25,390
half of the show,
what I think on that,

972
00:40:25,570 --> 00:40:26,740
but um,
but,

973
00:40:26,820 --> 00:40:29,020
but it seems like a weird proposition 
and therefore on the face of it.

974
00:40:29,230 --> 00:40:31,060
But if you read buzzfeed or vox or 
Corker,

975
00:40:31,061 --> 00:40:32,350
you'll get that impression.
Um,

976
00:40:32,440 --> 00:40:34,560
no,
I don't think gay people deserve anytime

977
00:40:34,630 --> 00:40:36,660
to be bullies to settle into,
you know,

978
00:40:36,670 --> 00:40:38,260
their position or authority.

979
00:40:38,260 --> 00:40:42,070
And I think it does gay people a lot of 
damage to see these bitter,

980
00:40:42,071 --> 00:40:42,904
hysterical,
Nasty Queens bullying and lecturing and 

981
00:40:46,091 --> 00:40:46,924
hectoring,
ordinary decent law abiding people of 

982
00:40:49,121 --> 00:40:49,954
faith.
And I thought it was utterly deplorable 

983
00:40:52,090 --> 00:40:55,570
when that couple who staged a renew of 
the vowels,

984
00:40:55,571 --> 00:40:56,404
they didn't even have a wedding,
but they staged a renewal of the vows 

985
00:40:58,061 --> 00:40:58,894
because already had the wedding solely.
It seemed to get a photo opportunity 

986
00:41:01,751 --> 00:41:03,190
with pizzas from memories,
pizza,

987
00:41:03,220 --> 00:41:04,053
which they they,
they tricked this Christian Christian 

988
00:41:05,951 --> 00:41:09,920
pizzeria into catering their thing.
Now set aside the horror,

989
00:41:09,970 --> 00:41:14,970
I think most gay people will feel about 
pizza and whether the carb would.

990
00:41:15,701 --> 00:41:16,534
I know I'm Greek and 13 showing I've 
told you a cameraman to shoot me from 

991
00:41:19,100 --> 00:41:21,610
here.
Set that aside,

992
00:41:21,670 --> 00:41:23,530
or how hollow and bitter,
what a terror,

993
00:41:23,590 --> 00:41:24,423
what an awful kind of human being you 
would have to be to turn your special 

994
00:41:26,861 --> 00:41:27,694
day of.
Send a day of appreciation and 

995
00:41:28,271 --> 00:41:32,710
celebration between you and your family,
the people that you love into an a cheap

996
00:41:32,711 --> 00:41:37,650
political stump.
People that you think that gay people in

997
00:41:37,690 --> 00:41:40,790
many cases turn themselves into the 
worst kind of grandstanding bigots.

998
00:41:40,791 --> 00:41:41,624
No,
they do not need time to settle in 

999
00:41:42,470 --> 00:41:43,430
there.
Very much settled.

1000
00:41:43,560 --> 00:41:44,311
Right.
So I,

1001
00:41:44,311 --> 00:41:46,930
I'm sort of with you on that because I,
I do understand that.

1002
00:41:46,931 --> 00:41:47,764
Look this,
they purposely did this for a Christian 

1003
00:41:49,330 --> 00:41:54,100
Baker had they went to have they go to 
an orthodox Jewish Baker or,

1004
00:41:54,250 --> 00:41:56,170
or a Muslim baker and forced them to do 
this.

1005
00:41:56,171 --> 00:41:58,060
The media wouldn't have nearly the fun 
that they had,

1006
00:41:59,240 --> 00:42:00,073
but so just wrapping this around atheism
and then we're going to do everything 

1007
00:42:01,721 --> 00:42:03,820
else we're going to do is gay for the 
rest of this after,

1008
00:42:03,821 --> 00:42:04,654
after this final question,
I know it's exhausting learning about 

1009
00:42:07,120 --> 00:42:09,730
what position of power do you think 
that,

1010
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:11,770
that I don't see atheists in any 
position.

1011
00:42:11,771 --> 00:42:12,604
Yes.
There are a couple cool thought of 

1012
00:42:13,841 --> 00:42:15,340
atheists out there.
Right?

1013
00:42:15,380 --> 00:42:18,130
So not about Neil degrasse Tyson or 
talking to someone about it because it's

1014
00:42:18,131 --> 00:42:20,640
not about positions of power.
It's about,

1015
00:42:20,780 --> 00:42:21,431
well,
what do you think?

1016
00:42:21,431 --> 00:42:22,290
Social cache,
but.

1017
00:42:22,360 --> 00:42:23,810
So what do you think that the,
the main,

1018
00:42:23,920 --> 00:42:24,753
the average atheist,
which an atheist is only brought 

1019
00:42:25,961 --> 00:42:28,390
together by the lack of belief in a 
deity.

1020
00:42:28,600 --> 00:42:29,480
A what

1021
00:42:30,030 --> 00:42:32,430
brought together by um,
you know,

1022
00:42:32,490 --> 00:42:36,300
sort of whispery facial hair,
terrible spectacle,

1023
00:42:36,301 --> 00:42:39,960
sort of long ginger ponytails,
terrible,

1024
00:42:40,320 --> 00:42:42,030
terrible,
thin skinned,

1025
00:42:42,090 --> 00:42:45,360
natural sort of demeanor to hair trigger
temper.

1026
00:42:45,510 --> 00:42:49,830
These are the primary characteristics of
an atheist looking at socks and sandals.

1027
00:42:50,960 --> 00:42:53,570
Terrible cheap Chinos,
you know,

1028
00:42:53,580 --> 00:42:55,290
all that kind of stuff.
That's what you want to consider.

1029
00:42:55,740 --> 00:42:58,380
If that's what you want to respond to,
then go right ahead.

1030
00:42:58,500 --> 00:42:59,333
But you know,
Catholic Catholics have all the best 

1031
00:43:02,821 --> 00:43:03,770
outfits,
you know,

1032
00:43:03,780 --> 00:43:04,740
rich,
older men in dresses.

1033
00:43:04,741 --> 00:43:05,574
What's not to love whenever you want,
if you want everyone to have a sense of 

1034
00:43:07,231 --> 00:43:09,410
style and you become a Muslim or 
Catholic.

1035
00:43:09,660 --> 00:43:10,860
Um,
no,

1036
00:43:10,861 --> 00:43:11,694
I mean,
look,

1037
00:43:11,860 --> 00:43:15,780
atheists are,
it is not just acceptable,

1038
00:43:15,781 --> 00:43:16,614
but it is the norm in any metropolitan 
city in Europe or in America to be an 

1039
00:43:20,071 --> 00:43:21,510
atheist.
It is normal to be an atheist.

1040
00:43:21,511 --> 00:43:22,860
People look at you weird if you're not

1041
00:43:22,970 --> 00:43:23,803
right.
So what?

1042
00:43:23,870 --> 00:43:25,510
So what's the problem with that?
That's,

1043
00:43:25,540 --> 00:43:27,760
that's the part I think it's funny to 
take the piss out of them.

1044
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:30,350
You just want to make fun of them.
Even though I enjoy making fun.

1045
00:43:30,490 --> 00:43:31,323
The Mondrian,
making fun out of everybody and you're 

1046
00:43:32,180 --> 00:43:34,000
making fun of you.
I enjoyed making fun of myself.

1047
00:43:34,001 --> 00:43:35,800
I make fun out of myself all day on my 
twitter feed.

1048
00:43:35,801 --> 00:43:36,740
That's what,
that's what

1049
00:43:36,780 --> 00:43:38,070
provocateurs do.
All right,

1050
00:43:38,100 --> 00:43:41,010
well I can accept that.
I will grant you that,

1051
00:43:41,011 --> 00:43:42,780
but I won Niger one,
that little section,

1052
00:43:42,781 --> 00:43:43,500
but.
Well,

1053
00:43:43,500 --> 00:43:45,080
you can have one hour if you can have 
that.

1054
00:43:45,840 --> 00:43:48,900
I want to spend the rest of the time 
talking about a whole bunch of gay stuff

1055
00:43:49,650 --> 00:43:53,250
because I mentioned on the show a week 
and we've done five of these here.

1056
00:43:53,750 --> 00:43:55,860
I think this is our fifth episode since 
we've been with aura.

1057
00:43:56,070 --> 00:43:58,650
I've only watched once mentioned 
anything about being gay.

1058
00:43:58,651 --> 00:43:59,484
I don't,
I don't make it an issue unless it's 

1059
00:44:00,871 --> 00:44:04,050
relevant and it is what it is.
I mean,

1060
00:44:04,110 --> 00:44:05,670
believe me,
I'm gay.

1061
00:44:05,671 --> 00:44:06,780
I'm married.
You know what I mean?

1062
00:44:06,781 --> 00:44:08,300
I'm married to do pretty gay.
Okay.

1063
00:44:08,650 --> 00:44:09,960
Um,
but I,

1064
00:44:09,961 --> 00:44:12,550
I don't know.
I know.

1065
00:44:12,560 --> 00:44:13,980
Okay.
So you will selling,

1066
00:44:14,330 --> 00:44:15,163
selling out,
selling out to the Hetero picture 

1067
00:44:16,990 --> 00:44:18,030
institution.
Yes.

1068
00:44:18,031 --> 00:44:18,960
Yes.
We'll get to those.

1069
00:44:19,680 --> 00:44:20,160
Yeah.
Yeah.

1070
00:44:20,160 --> 00:44:21,540
I know you have a better game.

1071
00:44:21,950 --> 00:44:23,210
My God.
Right.

1072
00:44:23,320 --> 00:44:25,110
Anything more awful.
So before

1073
00:44:25,110 --> 00:44:28,320
we do that portion of this,
it's hilarious.

1074
00:44:28,321 --> 00:44:30,990
The,
the liberal here married one.

1075
00:44:31,140 --> 00:44:33,030
The conservative one is the one railing 
against marriage.

1076
00:44:33,031 --> 00:44:33,890
It's,
it's fascinating.

1077
00:44:34,430 --> 00:44:36,360
I just think it's sad that,
you know,

1078
00:44:36,570 --> 00:44:38,790
I want heterosexual to come back to the 
institution of marriage.

1079
00:44:38,791 --> 00:44:40,350
I want them to realize that it's a good 
thing.

1080
00:44:40,351 --> 00:44:42,420
I want them to become more socially 
conservative in that regard.

1081
00:44:42,720 --> 00:44:44,960
I don't want gay people being growing 
up.

1082
00:44:44,961 --> 00:44:45,794
Right?
So we're just going to go all in on 

1083
00:44:46,231 --> 00:44:47,310
this.
I'll reverse my question.

1084
00:44:47,311 --> 00:44:48,060
So go,
go.

1085
00:44:48,060 --> 00:44:49,640
Alright.
I didn't think being gay

1086
00:44:49,720 --> 00:44:53,170
particularly fun and I wouldn't choose 
it for my children.

1087
00:44:53,171 --> 00:44:55,150
For example,
I think Sally Cohen who said that they'd

1088
00:44:55,151 --> 00:44:57,250
like so that she'd like to have a gay 
child.

1089
00:44:57,251 --> 00:44:59,830
I thought it was deplorable and sadistic
and incredibly selfish.

1090
00:44:59,880 --> 00:45:00,713
So meaning what if,
if salsify has come to a place of 

1091
00:45:03,721 --> 00:45:05,400
realization,
what she said was if she could,

1092
00:45:05,401 --> 00:45:06,840
if she said what she said was if she 
could pick,

1093
00:45:06,841 --> 00:45:07,674
she'd rather have a gay kid.
And I thought that was a horrible thing 

1094
00:45:08,911 --> 00:45:11,940
to say because what?
What's your last child?

1095
00:45:12,020 --> 00:45:13,950
My Trans Life.
So much more miserable.

1096
00:45:13,990 --> 00:45:15,750
But,
but it's getting easier every day.

1097
00:45:15,751 --> 00:45:17,220
We're,
don't you think that when,

1098
00:45:17,230 --> 00:45:18,570
uh,
how old are you?

1099
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:21,200
Oh Gee.
You don't ask again.

1100
00:45:21,650 --> 00:45:23,960
All right,
well if you really aren't a proper gay.

1101
00:45:23,961 --> 00:45:27,490
Oh yeah.
Terrible failure as a gay man lady.

1102
00:45:27,620 --> 00:45:29,540
What point b?
It's a lot,

1103
00:45:29,570 --> 00:45:30,403
it's a lot easier for you than it was 
for a 30 year old gay man 10 years ago 

1104
00:45:34,341 --> 00:45:38,600
and it's going to be way shobin the 
normalcy that will,

1105
00:45:39,860 --> 00:45:44,310
you're confusing two different things.
There's a sort of practical,

1106
00:45:44,840 --> 00:45:45,673
um,
ease with which a gay person can go 

1107
00:45:47,521 --> 00:45:52,230
through life because there is no longer 
the entrenched homophobia if you like it

1108
00:45:52,370 --> 00:45:54,290
in wider society.
The um,

1109
00:45:55,180 --> 00:45:57,120
the fact that gay people can,
can show,

1110
00:45:57,420 --> 00:45:59,970
can have a relationship and live 
together and nobody really cares.

1111
00:45:59,971 --> 00:46:01,350
And I don't think anybody cares anymore.

1112
00:46:01,890 --> 00:46:03,130
Um,
well I've said that for a long time.

1113
00:46:03,150 --> 00:46:05,210
I'm so sick of talking about it,
which is why I don't.

1114
00:46:05,420 --> 00:46:06,253
All I wanted was equal rights.
I just want to be treated better than 

1115
00:46:09,231 --> 00:46:10,290
anybody.
I think gay people

1116
00:46:10,310 --> 00:46:11,143
for getting married and in relationships
is a shame because I quite like the 

1117
00:46:14,271 --> 00:46:15,104
distance.
I'm a naughty sort of aspects of gay 

1118
00:46:17,511 --> 00:46:18,344
life and I think that it's part of my 
gay privileged to be able to tumble out 

1119
00:46:20,601 --> 00:46:22,250
of a nightclub at 3:00
AM with,

1120
00:46:22,251 --> 00:46:23,084
you know,
sort of dormant on my arm and he hops 

1121
00:46:25,030 --> 00:46:25,910
off off my face.
But

1122
00:46:26,210 --> 00:46:27,043
Oh,
you do that while still having other 

1123
00:46:29,440 --> 00:46:32,560
people like you,
people like you getting married,

1124
00:46:32,590 --> 00:46:37,590
getting a dog,
living in a little house in a horrible,

1125
00:46:38,021 --> 00:46:40,150
horrible,
no self respecting gay home,

1126
00:46:40,151 --> 00:46:40,984
enough to feed something like that.
I doesn't know what you're doing with 

1127
00:46:43,491 --> 00:46:44,750
your time.
What do you think?

1128
00:46:44,760 --> 00:46:46,930
He'll come home and come and sit down 
and I tell him who's cooking tonight.

1129
00:46:46,940 --> 00:46:47,350
Oh,
should I do?

1130
00:46:47,350 --> 00:46:48,180
Oh,
all right then.

1131
00:46:48,180 --> 00:46:50,010
Well,
he's awful,

1132
00:46:50,110 --> 00:46:51,310
awful,
awful.

1133
00:46:51,760 --> 00:46:53,680
But you shouldn't be in house long 
enough.

1134
00:46:53,681 --> 00:46:56,530
You've got to keep that alive.
But really do you really believe that?

1135
00:46:56,531 --> 00:46:57,364
I get it.
I get what you're doing here on the 

1136
00:46:59,230 --> 00:47:00,250
snark level.
I get it.

1137
00:47:00,490 --> 00:47:01,323
No,
I do think there's some value in this 

1138
00:47:02,750 --> 00:47:03,350
cause

1139
00:47:03,350 --> 00:47:08,350
I think that,
and I think it's because gape.

1140
00:47:08,650 --> 00:47:09,483
Look,
homosexuality is a dissident apple 

1141
00:47:12,260 --> 00:47:13,430
sexuality.
I mean that in a,

1142
00:47:13,431 --> 00:47:16,550
in a morally neutral sense.
You just mean it's the other.

1143
00:47:16,610 --> 00:47:17,443
I don't know.
I don't mean that in using the term 

1144
00:47:20,420 --> 00:47:22,100
correctly,
but what do you mean?

1145
00:47:22,130 --> 00:47:22,963
No,
I didn't say apartment.

1146
00:47:22,970 --> 00:47:23,780
I said,
look,

1147
00:47:23,780 --> 00:47:24,613
I'm,
let's,

1148
00:47:24,620 --> 00:47:27,350
let's set the religion stuff aside 
because I was going to get into a rabbit

1149
00:47:27,351 --> 00:47:28,530
hole,
but let's just say you know,

1150
00:47:28,680 --> 00:47:32,950
what is not the norm.
It is an abhorrent sexuality that Mother

1151
00:47:32,950 --> 00:47:34,270
Nature May do for a variety of reasons,
right?

1152
00:47:34,570 --> 00:47:35,403
There's some evidence that people with 
higher iqs are more likely to engage in 

1153
00:47:37,900 --> 00:47:38,733
different sexual appetites is one of the
reasons why gay people have 

1154
00:47:41,381 --> 00:47:43,990
disproportionately higher iqs and one of
the reasons I think,

1155
00:47:43,991 --> 00:47:45,490
for example,
that guests would get back in the closet

1156
00:47:45,491 --> 00:47:46,324
because we're making society stupider 
because gay people aren't reading 

1157
00:47:47,591 --> 00:47:48,700
anymore.
Um,

1158
00:47:48,701 --> 00:47:49,534
it was previously you could,
you would have a marriage with a woman 

1159
00:47:51,100 --> 00:47:51,933
and you would have a couple of kids and 
gay men were still in the gene pool 

1160
00:47:53,741 --> 00:47:54,574
right now.
They've taken themselves out and they 

1161
00:47:55,391 --> 00:47:56,830
don't have their own biological children
anymore.

1162
00:47:56,831 --> 00:47:57,664
Like you've got your sort of two to five
percent of the smartest men in 

1163
00:47:59,351 --> 00:48:00,250
population not breeding in.
Yeah.

1164
00:48:00,290 --> 00:48:01,970
What people keep saying,
are we going to have kids?

1165
00:48:01,971 --> 00:48:02,541
And I say,
I don't know,

1166
00:48:02,541 --> 00:48:03,590
but we're going to keep it.
If you do,

1167
00:48:03,591 --> 00:48:04,424
you should have your own biological 
children because you're smarter than 

1168
00:48:05,781 --> 00:48:08,660
most people in your lab.
Did you catch that?

1169
00:48:08,670 --> 00:48:11,280
What we're going to keep trying.
Oh,

1170
00:48:11,880 --> 00:48:13,640
see,
you're so into your thing.

1171
00:48:13,820 --> 00:48:14,830
They're being serious.
All right.

1172
00:48:14,880 --> 00:48:15,290
All right.

1173
00:48:15,290 --> 00:48:16,090
Um,
yeah,

1174
00:48:16,090 --> 00:48:16,881
no.
Okay.

1175
00:48:16,881 --> 00:48:17,271
Yeah.
All right.

1176
00:48:17,271 --> 00:48:18,390
Um,
it doesn't,

1177
00:48:18,410 --> 00:48:22,240
it doesn't work when,
you know,

1178
00:48:22,850 --> 00:48:24,080
it's,
it's kind of a silly thing,

1179
00:48:24,081 --> 00:48:24,914
but it's certainly true that the sort of
average intelligence society sort of 

1180
00:48:28,011 --> 00:48:30,380
chugging up with slowly,
but it is definitely being retarded.

1181
00:48:30,410 --> 00:48:31,243
If a five to 10 percent of two to five 
percent rather have the smartest people 

1182
00:48:34,821 --> 00:48:36,260
in society aren't breathing anymore.
So anyway,

1183
00:48:36,261 --> 00:48:37,310
I think that's a silly argument.
But,

1184
00:48:37,610 --> 00:48:38,260
um,
I,

1185
00:48:38,260 --> 00:48:41,150
I do think there is,
it's a shame when,

1186
00:48:43,280 --> 00:48:44,113
as a gay is just one of those people 
that Mother Nature has selected to be 

1187
00:48:46,911 --> 00:48:49,400
different and to test stuff out and to 
push the boundaries,

1188
00:48:49,430 --> 00:48:51,170
which we'll come onto in a minute.
In respect to free speech,

1189
00:48:51,171 --> 00:48:52,430
I think,
um,

1190
00:48:53,300 --> 00:48:55,520
that you sort of buy into precisely the 
sort of,

1191
00:48:55,640 --> 00:48:56,473
uh,
sort of socially conservative 

1192
00:48:57,021 --> 00:48:57,854
institutions,
which I love and I recognize the 

1193
00:48:58,791 --> 00:49:01,150
building blocks of society.
I recognize at the basis of elephants,

1194
00:49:01,600 --> 00:49:02,433
I'm fascinated

1195
00:49:04,280 --> 00:49:05,113
as a homosexual,
not escapes that shouldn't have them as 

1196
00:49:07,641 --> 00:49:09,470
a homosexual.
You should recognize that your,

1197
00:49:09,860 --> 00:49:10,693
your evolutionary function is to 
experiment with different models of 

1198
00:49:14,421 --> 00:49:15,254
things.
Right.

1199
00:49:15,290 --> 00:49:16,123
And one of the ways in which gay culture
and society has done is the sort of sex 

1200
00:49:19,161 --> 00:49:21,900
matt hedonism that I enjoy that I think 
I.

1201
00:49:22,030 --> 00:49:24,410
I'm sorry that you didn't,
you don't have any more because you have

1202
00:49:24,411 --> 00:49:25,244
this horrible.

1203
00:49:25,760 --> 00:49:27,920
Well I've done.
Wait,

1204
00:49:28,070 --> 00:49:28,903
hold on.
But you're combining different things 

1205
00:49:30,111 --> 00:49:31,550
here.
So first off,

1206
00:49:31,580 --> 00:49:34,010
the sense that a lot of what you're 
saying is you just,

1207
00:49:34,040 --> 00:49:38,810
you long for the day probably when you 
were 22 and you were out every night and

1208
00:49:38,811 --> 00:49:40,630
doing all kinds of drugs and having all 
kinds of.

1209
00:49:41,190 --> 00:49:42,980
All right,
so we'd last week,

1210
00:49:42,981 --> 00:49:45,530
right?
So you on for that day and a lot of,

1211
00:49:45,710 --> 00:49:48,620
a lot of mainstream gay look,
I live in West Hollywood.

1212
00:49:48,621 --> 00:49:52,940
I see what the.
So I think gay people have become very,

1213
00:49:52,941 --> 00:49:55,700
very dull,
but it's a shame isn't that?

1214
00:49:55,730 --> 00:49:57,590
No,
it's not good because we assess,

1215
00:49:57,940 --> 00:49:59,360
we have equality.

1216
00:49:59,430 --> 00:50:01,590
No.
Why would we want to be equal?

1217
00:50:01,591 --> 00:50:02,424
We were already superior.
Why would we want to go down to a 

1218
00:50:04,961 --> 00:50:06,390
quality?
It's absurd to me.

1219
00:50:06,550 --> 00:50:07,151
We,
you know,

1220
00:50:07,151 --> 00:50:10,290
we have gay people in the world,
Mother Nature makes mistakes and make so

1221
00:50:10,291 --> 00:50:11,430
great discoveries.
That will be great.

1222
00:50:11,460 --> 00:50:13,140
[inaudible] called the gate geniuses in 
history.

1223
00:50:13,141 --> 00:50:14,820
You know,
whether it's cheering or you know,

1224
00:50:14,880 --> 00:50:16,800
Abe Lincoln reportedly,
or you know,

1225
00:50:16,801 --> 00:50:17,960
all the,
the Roman emperors,

1226
00:50:17,970 --> 00:50:18,803
you know,
look at what Mother Nature does with 

1227
00:50:20,131 --> 00:50:25,050
these special people at the top end of 
the intelligence and sort of decisions a

1228
00:50:25,380 --> 00:50:26,213
scale.
Those,

1229
00:50:26,220 --> 00:50:27,590
those,
those,

1230
00:50:27,670 --> 00:50:29,210
what steve jobs will called the crazy 
ones,

1231
00:50:29,211 --> 00:50:30,044
right?
And this is why the tech and gaming 

1232
00:50:31,131 --> 00:50:31,964
industry so disproportionately I'm gay 
and Trans because it's those special 

1233
00:50:35,241 --> 00:50:36,074
people that have brains wired slightly 
differently from others who could make 

1234
00:50:38,061 --> 00:50:40,790
those great leaps,
who can consider problems differently,

1235
00:50:40,940 --> 00:50:43,430
who could,
who are generally more creative and more

1236
00:50:43,690 --> 00:50:45,220
what I'm with you on the music

1237
00:50:46,870 --> 00:50:49,120
as a why as a member of the game master 
race,

1238
00:50:49,121 --> 00:50:51,850
would you want to slump down to the 
level of heterosexuality

1239
00:50:53,160 --> 00:50:53,993
because you should have the option.
I'm not telling you what to do if you 

1240
00:50:57,601 --> 00:50:58,434
want the option,
what I'm telling you as you made the 

1241
00:50:58,921 --> 00:51:01,910
wrong choice.
Okay?

1242
00:51:01,920 --> 00:51:02,753
So you don't think that a lot of these 
people that are doing all the things 

1243
00:51:06,541 --> 00:51:09,120
that I did them,
all of those things,

1244
00:51:09,360 --> 00:51:10,171
sex,
drugs,

1245
00:51:10,171 --> 00:51:11,520
all of that.
I did all that.

1246
00:51:11,880 --> 00:51:12,990
You know what I mean?
I don't.

1247
00:51:12,991 --> 00:51:15,480
I look back on much of it very fondly.
Actually.

1248
00:51:15,720 --> 00:51:16,553
People,
people call me a traitor to my 

1249
00:51:17,650 --> 00:51:19,380
sexuality,
Tracy Tracy,

1250
00:51:20,660 --> 00:51:21,493
at least that moment to fill.
I think my agent would allow me to tell 

1251
00:51:23,800 --> 00:51:25,270
you why come to,
but um,

1252
00:51:25,300 --> 00:51:26,133
you know,

1253
00:51:26,370 --> 00:51:28,180
but wouldn't you?
So the things that you,

1254
00:51:28,230 --> 00:51:30,870
I think you're looking at this in this 
nostalgic way of fun,

1255
00:51:31,140 --> 00:51:34,470
but there was the sense of,
but wouldn't you trade some of that?

1256
00:51:34,471 --> 00:51:35,730
Look,
when you think about all the people that

1257
00:51:35,731 --> 00:51:38,570
are having promiscuous sex and getting 
all that,

1258
00:51:39,050 --> 00:51:42,690
are those numbers going to directly go 
down because

1259
00:51:43,490 --> 00:51:45,250
care about sexually transmitted 
diseases.

1260
00:51:45,251 --> 00:51:47,380
Who gives a shit?
I don't care about that.

1261
00:51:47,410 --> 00:51:52,090
What I care about is the fact that this 
is a serious point here.

1262
00:51:52,091 --> 00:51:54,100
It's not just the foreigner living those
fun lifestyles,

1263
00:51:54,101 --> 00:51:55,580
and I mentioned Steve Jobs earlier and 
he said,

1264
00:51:55,581 --> 00:51:56,414
but much moment,
many of his innovations come from the 

1265
00:51:57,700 --> 00:51:58,700
faculty took Lsd,
right?

1266
00:51:59,020 --> 00:52:01,660
Gay people have a license to experiment 
and license to explore.

1267
00:52:01,800 --> 00:52:02,633
Um,
and it's one of the reasons why I'm gay 

1268
00:52:04,660 --> 00:52:06,370
culture,
which is so,

1269
00:52:06,850 --> 00:52:08,020
so,
um,

1270
00:52:08,620 --> 00:52:09,453
to do with exploring boundaries,
pushing the limits of acceptable 

1271
00:52:12,041 --> 00:52:13,840
discourse and speech and thought,
right?

1272
00:52:14,590 --> 00:52:17,880
Those are all the things that I love 
that I know you don't because you slid,

1273
00:52:17,900 --> 00:52:22,160
slid into,
I'm honoring all the slit,

1274
00:52:22,720 --> 00:52:24,820
boring domesticity.
It is precisely with those,

1275
00:52:24,821 --> 00:52:28,090
put those horizon broadening experiences
which you have given up as a,

1276
00:52:28,360 --> 00:52:29,193
as a,
as a housewife or house husband or 

1277
00:52:30,191 --> 00:52:30,800
whatever.

1278
00:52:30,800 --> 00:52:35,270
I think two weeks of having home cooked 
meals and watching that for two weeks,

1279
00:52:35,280 --> 00:52:39,570
if I wanted to enjoy myself,
I want to kill myself and people call me

1280
00:52:39,571 --> 00:52:40,020
a traitor,

1281
00:52:40,020 --> 00:52:41,530
my sexuality please.
Um,

1282
00:52:42,110 --> 00:52:42,670
no.
Look,

1283
00:52:42,670 --> 00:52:43,503
I think that gay people are one of the 
groups in which mother nature sort of 

1284
00:52:46,990 --> 00:52:47,823
one of the groups,
Mother Nature's given license to go go 

1285
00:52:49,361 --> 00:52:52,510
wild.
And that's why so many great artists and

1286
00:52:52,511 --> 00:52:55,480
inventors and authors and all ever been 
gay,

1287
00:52:55,481 --> 00:52:55,971
lesbian,
whatever,

1288
00:52:55,971 --> 00:52:56,804
right?
Because we have a unique license and 

1289
00:52:58,901 --> 00:53:01,300
unique opportunity in insight into the 
fringes,

1290
00:53:01,301 --> 00:53:04,900
into the that the edge of culture that 
makes stuff interesting.

1291
00:53:05,110 --> 00:53:08,380
We have an ability to push further than,
than ordinary people can.

1292
00:53:08,620 --> 00:53:10,900
We can say things they can't say.
For example,

1293
00:53:10,901 --> 00:53:11,734
I can go on TV and say all manner of 
outrageous things about feminism only 

1294
00:53:14,771 --> 00:53:15,940
because I'm homosexual.
Right.

1295
00:53:16,410 --> 00:53:18,190
Let me ask you this.
Do you think I could get away with those

1296
00:53:18,191 --> 00:53:19,024
same things?
Because obviously we have a little 

1297
00:53:19,781 --> 00:53:21,010
different effect.
People always say to me,

1298
00:53:21,011 --> 00:53:21,844
you don't see gay,
which I know you wouldn't able to you 

1299
00:53:23,151 --> 00:53:26,340
would you say it as compliment kind of 
my thing,

1300
00:53:26,340 --> 00:53:27,173
right?
People know that I'm going to do this 

1301
00:53:28,230 --> 00:53:29,063
sort of social justice proof.
It's very difficult to argue that a 

1302
00:53:30,901 --> 00:53:32,970
flamboyant homosexual who never shuts up
about.

1303
00:53:32,971 --> 00:53:34,110
How about,
you know,

1304
00:53:34,410 --> 00:53:36,690
black boyfriends is in any way bigoted,
right?

1305
00:53:36,870 --> 00:53:37,703
So it gives me,
have established myself in the public 

1306
00:53:39,660 --> 00:53:41,760
mind,
the public imagination in a way that you

1307
00:53:41,761 --> 00:53:42,180
haven't.

1308
00:53:42,180 --> 00:53:43,440
So a lot of that,
ironically,

1309
00:53:43,441 --> 00:53:47,580
that's what this is about you like while
you were in some ways rail against these

1310
00:53:47,581 --> 00:53:50,880
people that want to be protected like 
the feminists or whatever you do.

1311
00:53:50,881 --> 00:53:51,714
Like

1312
00:53:52,060 --> 00:53:52,893
I enjoy using their weapons against them
and I'm perfectly open to use a weapon 

1313
00:53:54,661 --> 00:53:57,400
against.
I wish I didn't have too much.

1314
00:53:58,240 --> 00:53:59,073
No,
I don't want to be trolling people for 

1315
00:53:59,561 --> 00:54:00,600
my whole life.
Of course I don't,

1316
00:54:00,601 --> 00:54:03,300
you know,
but I would much rather it were the case

1317
00:54:03,301 --> 00:54:05,670
that everybody had free open frank 
discussion.

1318
00:54:05,671 --> 00:54:07,290
But as the media as currently 
constituted,

1319
00:54:07,291 --> 00:54:08,124
if you want to push forward to 
discussion outside the realms of 

1320
00:54:09,691 --> 00:54:13,260
academia in the public square talking to
ordinary people.

1321
00:54:13,590 --> 00:54:14,423
For example,
I write for a publication that sort of 

1322
00:54:15,121 --> 00:54:17,580
mid Brown midmarket publication for 
everyone.

1323
00:54:17,720 --> 00:54:18,553
The,
the sort of Digital Media Company of a 

1324
00:54:19,261 --> 00:54:20,740
tabloid newspaper.
Um,

1325
00:54:21,010 --> 00:54:23,820
I wanna talk to everybody and to push 
debate forward in those environments.

1326
00:54:23,821 --> 00:54:24,654
You do have to play by the rules and 
some of those rules are based on 

1327
00:54:26,251 --> 00:54:28,700
identity politics,
which I think are absurd and obscene.

1328
00:54:28,710 --> 00:54:29,543
Stupid.
But I will certainly play along with 

1329
00:54:30,751 --> 00:54:35,751
them if it helps because it's so long as
as progressives and feminists refused to

1330
00:54:36,061 --> 00:54:38,790
have a debate on the base of the facts 
and insist on having a debate,

1331
00:54:38,820 --> 00:54:39,653
you know,
the basis of identity and skin color 

1332
00:54:41,731 --> 00:54:42,570
instead.
Fine.

1333
00:54:42,571 --> 00:54:44,050
I can beat them in that too.
You know,

1334
00:54:44,280 --> 00:54:48,180
I'm happy to beat you on any playing 
field on any battlefield you choose.

1335
00:54:48,181 --> 00:54:49,014
They've chosen identity politics.
I can beat them there if they ever want 

1336
00:54:50,761 --> 00:54:51,920
to come to the table and debate 
properly,

1337
00:54:52,850 --> 00:54:53,683
I think.
I think you're onto something 

1338
00:54:54,471 --> 00:54:56,300
interesting there that you'll use their 
weapons.

1339
00:54:56,301 --> 00:54:57,780
I don't like their weapons.
And you're,

1340
00:54:58,390 --> 00:55:00,110
that you're using their weapons against 
them.

1341
00:55:00,111 --> 00:55:02,540
I think in a cheeky sense were you were,
you know,

1342
00:55:02,541 --> 00:55:04,950
that you're a wink to what,
you know,

1343
00:55:05,890 --> 00:55:07,620
anybody who reads my twitter feed knows 
it's,

1344
00:55:07,630 --> 00:55:08,860
you know,
I know exactly what's up.

1345
00:55:08,861 --> 00:55:10,540
I know what's going on,
but they still lose.

1346
00:55:10,560 --> 00:55:11,393
Anyway.
Um,

1347
00:55:11,750 --> 00:55:12,370
so,

1348
00:55:12,370 --> 00:55:16,030
so part of the reason why I wanted to do
this is because I do find that again,

1349
00:55:16,031 --> 00:55:16,864
while we come from different,
we literally come from different 

1350
00:55:18,491 --> 00:55:21,580
countries but come from different 
political parts of this that you really,

1351
00:55:21,581 --> 00:55:24,100
at least in American media,
only get one gay,

1352
00:55:24,160 --> 00:55:24,993
only one gay gets out there and it's the
bravo gay that's either on tv because 

1353
00:55:28,421 --> 00:55:29,254
they're a Fashionista or they're a 
sidekick to one of the housewives or 

1354
00:55:33,371 --> 00:55:36,100
they're somehow involved in pop culture 
or something like that.

1355
00:55:36,370 --> 00:55:40,180
Or every now and again someone can break
free like an Anderson Cooper,

1356
00:55:40,390 --> 00:55:42,700
but then sort of have to be completely 
asexual,

1357
00:55:42,701 --> 00:55:44,800
right?
Never talk about their life.

1358
00:55:44,801 --> 00:55:48,610
And I think this is sort of interesting 
because we both break that,

1359
00:55:48,960 --> 00:55:49,780
that paradigm.

1360
00:55:49,780 --> 00:55:51,970
Yes.
And I think it's probably because we are

1361
00:55:52,030 --> 00:55:52,863
cultural libertarians.
I would certainly describe myself as 

1362
00:55:54,671 --> 00:55:57,610
one.
I think you'd probably agree with that.

1363
00:55:57,670 --> 00:55:59,800
I think that we are those sorts of 
insurgent,

1364
00:55:59,830 --> 00:56:02,560
countercultural,
new media personalities.

1365
00:56:03,800 --> 00:56:05,830
We exist.
You may not like to hear this,

1366
00:56:05,831 --> 00:56:08,770
but we exist on a spectrum with people 
like trump and ann coulter,

1367
00:56:09,050 --> 00:56:09,883
a motor.
It probably only went more on the 

1368
00:56:10,511 --> 00:56:11,344
serious end of it simply in tapping into
ordinary people's frustrations with the 

1369
00:56:14,890 --> 00:56:17,700
limits and absurdities of,
you know,

1370
00:56:18,130 --> 00:56:21,610
what they see on broadcast television 
and what they read in the newspapers.

1371
00:56:21,850 --> 00:56:22,683
There is an alternative way of having a 
discussion which is more honest and 

1372
00:56:24,971 --> 00:56:25,804
more,
um,

1373
00:56:26,380 --> 00:56:27,191
more.
I mean,

1374
00:56:27,191 --> 00:56:29,380
this kind of thing could not happen on 
broadcast television for example.

1375
00:56:29,381 --> 00:56:31,000
And that's a problem.
That's a problem for the media.

1376
00:56:31,001 --> 00:56:31,834
It's one of the reasons that,
exactly one of the reasons everybody 

1377
00:56:33,671 --> 00:56:34,450
hates them.

1378
00:56:34,450 --> 00:56:35,180
Um,
you know,

1379
00:56:35,180 --> 00:56:36,013
and I think we both started taking 
advantage of that fact as far as 

1380
00:56:38,471 --> 00:56:40,690
sexuality goes.
What I find interesting about,

1381
00:56:41,410 --> 00:56:42,243
you know,
a liberal and conservative homosexual 

1382
00:56:43,630 --> 00:56:44,463
agreeing on so much about 
authoritarianism is that from my point 

1383
00:56:49,091 --> 00:56:52,270
of view of homosexuality is where we 
experiment and you know,

1384
00:56:52,480 --> 00:56:53,313
Drag Queen Culture for example,
is all about pushing the boundaries of 

1385
00:56:54,641 --> 00:56:59,170
acceptable language and thought we see 
the threats to freedom of speech.

1386
00:56:59,171 --> 00:57:00,004
For example,
we see the authoritarian threat of 

1387
00:57:01,990 --> 00:57:02,823
coming over the horizon a long time 
before anybody else and we're in a 

1388
00:57:05,561 --> 00:57:07,720
position to warn other people about it.
Um,

1389
00:57:07,930 --> 00:57:10,630
and as a very serious point about this,
which is not just that,

1390
00:57:11,100 --> 00:57:13,420
you know,
transsexuals to hate drag queens,

1391
00:57:13,421 --> 00:57:14,254
which is one front in this sort of 
progressive fracturing because drag 

1392
00:57:16,541 --> 00:57:17,261
queens loves,
you know,

1393
00:57:17,261 --> 00:57:19,240
there's sort of no holds bar Joan River 
style comedy,

1394
00:57:19,241 --> 00:57:20,800
which you know,
is the essence of,

1395
00:57:21,100 --> 00:57:22,110
of,
of gay identity,

1396
00:57:22,120 --> 00:57:22,953
sort of pushing those boundaries in 
experimentation and transgender people 

1397
00:57:26,891 --> 00:57:28,690
who have kind of fallen into this 
authoritarian mode,

1398
00:57:28,691 --> 00:57:29,524
hate that kind of stuff.

1399
00:57:30,590 --> 00:57:31,840
It's not just,
it's not just about that,

1400
00:57:31,841 --> 00:57:32,674
it's not,
it's about our community fracturing if 

1401
00:57:33,191 --> 00:57:34,024
you'd like,
but it's also that we see some of the 

1402
00:57:35,591 --> 00:57:38,080
serious consequences to these 
infringements on,

1403
00:57:38,410 --> 00:57:42,580
on culture because of course politics is
downstream from culture and what becomes

1404
00:57:42,581 --> 00:57:43,414
not unacceptable.
Sans Politics becomes unacceptable to 

1405
00:57:44,771 --> 00:57:45,604
the.
So what becomes unacceptable in culture 

1406
00:57:47,260 --> 00:57:48,680
becomes an and politics,
right?

1407
00:57:48,850 --> 00:57:49,683
Um,
and we recognize and we see the warning 

1408
00:57:51,480 --> 00:57:52,313
signs.
So we're sort of the canary in the coal 

1409
00:57:53,681 --> 00:57:54,131
mine.
Yes.

1410
00:57:54,131 --> 00:57:56,650
I think that's true.
I think gamers did this too,

1411
00:57:56,651 --> 00:57:58,510
you know,
I think gamers engaged very,

1412
00:57:58,511 --> 00:58:01,870
very similarly because gamers are 
marginalized people in many cases.

1413
00:58:01,871 --> 00:58:03,940
I'm just proportionately ethnic 
minority,

1414
00:58:03,941 --> 00:58:04,774
just fortunately gay,
disproportionately transgender in my 

1415
00:58:06,071 --> 00:58:06,904
experience.
Often marginalized personalities are 

1416
00:58:08,470 --> 00:58:09,303
often people who are retreating into 
video games maybe because they have 

1417
00:58:11,600 --> 00:58:13,660
great social skills,
often very bright,

1418
00:58:14,280 --> 00:58:16,750
sort of brilliant kind of autistic,
you know,

1419
00:58:16,840 --> 00:58:17,673
methodical.

1420
00:58:18,040 --> 00:58:21,210
I'm very male,
brilliant minds and very funny,

1421
00:58:21,250 --> 00:58:22,780
but sometimes don't have those social 
skills.

1422
00:58:22,960 --> 00:58:23,793
And in that way they're quite similar to
gates because they had to occupy a 

1423
00:58:25,781 --> 00:58:26,614
fairly unique position in the social 
hierarchy of society and I think gamers 

1424
00:58:29,950 --> 00:58:33,760
did in their own industry what gay 
people ought to be doing in public life,

1425
00:58:33,761 --> 00:58:36,010
which is precisely that being a canary 
in the coal mine and saying,

1426
00:58:36,011 --> 00:58:36,844
for example,
that the sort of nannying hectoring 

1427
00:58:40,330 --> 00:58:41,163
language policing that's happening in 
progressive media today is a problem as 

1428
00:58:43,931 --> 00:58:44,830
a problem.
Because,

1429
00:58:45,050 --> 00:58:47,770
I mean,
this is the first signs are the policing

1430
00:58:47,771 --> 00:58:49,750
of gay sexuality.
There's a piece in,

1431
00:58:50,020 --> 00:58:52,960
in the daily beast I think that said 
that,

1432
00:58:52,961 --> 00:58:53,794
um,
men who express a racial preference on 

1433
00:58:56,601 --> 00:58:57,434
their grindr profile are racist now.
It's obviously an absurd thing to say 

1434
00:59:01,151 --> 00:59:04,360
it's completely stupid and it was some 
idiot middle class white woman,

1435
00:59:05,040 --> 00:59:06,750
um,
who decided that she was going to police

1436
00:59:06,760 --> 00:59:08,600
gay sexuality today just as well,
you know,

1437
00:59:08,710 --> 00:59:10,360
just as we were getting to a position of
tolerance,

1438
00:59:10,361 --> 00:59:11,194
suddenly there's someone coming up 
coming over the horizon to police gay 

1439
00:59:13,220 --> 00:59:14,530
sexuality.
It's happening for two reasons.

1440
00:59:14,740 --> 00:59:16,330
One,
I'm gay.

1441
00:59:16,331 --> 00:59:19,180
Men have high status in society.
They become very molly cold,

1442
00:59:19,181 --> 00:59:20,014
very celebrated in the media.
So they've sort of acquired a kind of 

1443
00:59:22,491 --> 00:59:23,324
privilege and when the left,
the left is constantly engaged in the 

1444
00:59:25,431 --> 00:59:28,400
business of ranking people according to 
their oppression rating.

1445
00:59:29,090 --> 00:59:32,240
And Gay men don't school very well in 
those games because,

1446
00:59:32,360 --> 00:59:33,193
you know,
we looked,

1447
00:59:33,320 --> 00:59:35,150
we looked good and we have money and 
we're know we're,

1448
00:59:35,151 --> 00:59:36,770
we've basically become another kind of 
white man.

1449
00:59:37,230 --> 00:59:38,063
Right.
So you would say that basically the 

1450
00:59:38,621 --> 00:59:39,454
progressives,
or as I'm now calling them the 

1451
00:59:40,421 --> 00:59:42,740
regressives basically you're done with 
the gays.

1452
00:59:42,900 --> 00:59:43,700
Yes.
Yes,

1453
00:59:43,700 --> 00:59:46,720
that's exactly the world game sense.
They were like,

1454
00:59:46,920 --> 00:59:48,250
we're going to,
we're all for it done with you now

1455
00:59:48,800 --> 00:59:49,200
with,
you know,

1456
00:59:49,200 --> 00:59:50,033
they've got your gay marriage and now 
you are going to find increasingly that 

1457
00:59:52,261 --> 00:59:53,094
they come off to you and they're going 
to come after you because you're being 

1458
00:59:54,751 --> 00:59:56,580
too racially insensitive.
They're gonna come after you because you

1459
00:59:56,581 --> 00:59:58,770
use the wrong pronouns.
They're going to come after you absurdly

1460
00:59:58,771 --> 01:00:00,590
and brilliantly for massage one.
Um,

1461
01:00:00,620 --> 01:00:01,453
you know,
I mean people,

1462
01:00:01,620 --> 01:00:03,810
people make arguments to me sometimes 
and they say,

1463
01:00:03,811 --> 01:00:04,644
and it's not as credible in your case,
but I can understand how we construct 

1464
01:00:06,811 --> 01:00:07,644
the argument as bonkers as is.
And they make arguments that basically 

1465
01:00:09,631 --> 01:00:10,780
boiled down to your sacrum.
Associates do,

1466
01:00:10,781 --> 01:00:11,980
you went gay,
um,

1467
01:00:12,020 --> 01:00:12,541
you know,
sort of,

1468
01:00:12,541 --> 01:00:13,860
you hate,
you hate women so much.

1469
01:00:13,861 --> 01:00:17,280
I can tell why you while you sleep with 
men now happens to be that.

1470
01:00:17,281 --> 01:00:19,770
I do think there's a large element of 
choice in my sexual orientation,

1471
01:00:19,771 --> 01:00:22,050
although that goes entirely against a 
progressive consensus.

1472
01:00:22,050 --> 01:00:24,120
We'll do a whole thing on that in 
another show,

1473
01:00:25,200 --> 01:00:26,033
but it's an extraordinary thing that 
they now coming off to gay people for 

1474
01:00:28,351 --> 01:00:30,840
being misogynistic,
for being racist or sorts.

1475
01:00:31,080 --> 01:00:33,390
Your no longer of any use to your own 
site,

1476
01:00:33,450 --> 01:00:34,283
right?
They have used you and they have a 

1477
01:00:36,271 --> 01:00:37,690
wedding ring on your finger.
They have,

1478
01:00:37,950 --> 01:00:42,030
they have domesticated view like they 
would a dog like you did your dog.

1479
01:00:42,180 --> 01:00:44,130
They have put you in a.
They have,

1480
01:00:44,160 --> 01:00:44,993
they have made sure you got the right 
politics that you say the right things 

1481
01:00:46,441 --> 01:00:49,320
in public.
They have domesticated and delineated.

1482
01:00:49,500 --> 01:00:50,333
You know,
I'm the sort of useful liberal gay 

1483
01:00:52,891 --> 01:00:53,724
idiots and put them all in little 
ghettos in cities like the Castro and 

1484
01:00:56,671 --> 01:01:00,070
West Hollywood.
And now you are the product and the um,

1485
01:01:00,300 --> 01:01:02,370
and the chattel of the,
of the liberal.

1486
01:01:02,510 --> 01:01:05,760
So I know both into you don't mean me 
specific.

1487
01:01:05,761 --> 01:01:06,594
Now I do know they know I do many news,
but you know that I stand for into all 

1488
01:01:09,210 --> 01:01:10,021
this.
But you know,

1489
01:01:10,021 --> 01:01:12,540
I stand again.
So it a sort of gay marriage as a way of

1490
01:01:12,541 --> 01:01:13,420
controlling gate.

1491
01:01:13,620 --> 01:01:15,670
Right?
But I suspect that along the way,

1492
01:01:15,671 --> 01:01:16,504
if you met the right person,
you would want to marry that person for 

1493
01:01:19,211 --> 01:01:20,380
all the romance.
No,

1494
01:01:20,550 --> 01:01:23,050
I might move them into the west wing,
but I wouldn't marry them.

1495
01:01:24,740 --> 01:01:25,331
Okay.
Okay.

1496
01:01:25,331 --> 01:01:26,164
So we do have to wrap up here and the 
way we could have done three hours here 

1497
01:01:28,140 --> 01:01:29,650
and we're.
We'll do this again for sure.

1498
01:01:29,760 --> 01:01:31,840
At this point.
I want to get to this,

1499
01:01:32,170 --> 01:01:33,003
this piece that has been the throughline
to everything we've been discussing 

1500
01:01:35,351 --> 01:01:36,184
here,
this,

1501
01:01:36,190 --> 01:01:38,430
this authoritarian,
left this,

1502
01:01:38,431 --> 01:01:42,550
this regressive piece where there have 
no problem relentless.

1503
01:01:42,790 --> 01:01:43,623
Look,
I could use the example of the gay 

1504
01:01:44,591 --> 01:01:46,980
rights groups here in America,
you know,

1505
01:01:46,990 --> 01:01:47,823
glad or the HRC who will relent,
who will attack the pizza makers 

1506
01:01:50,771 --> 01:01:51,604
relentlessly.
But we'll say nothing when gays are 

1507
01:01:53,081 --> 01:01:55,420
thrown off the roof in Iran.
In Iran,

1508
01:01:55,421 --> 01:01:56,254
right?
Yeah.

1509
01:01:57,690 --> 01:01:57,960
Kind of

1510
01:01:57,960 --> 01:01:58,980
gay speak out.
You know,

1511
01:01:59,190 --> 01:02:00,023
I'm the only guy there is.
There is a sort of person in America 

1512
01:02:02,311 --> 01:02:02,940
today.
Sorry to interrupt you,

1513
01:02:02,940 --> 01:02:03,773
but there's this sort of person in 
America today who is a homosexual 

1514
01:02:06,331 --> 01:02:08,190
discrimination against it's gay 
conservatives.

1515
01:02:08,410 --> 01:02:09,243
It was much more difficult to admit 
you're a gay conservative then you just 

1516
01:02:11,001 --> 01:02:11,321
met,
you're gay,

1517
01:02:11,321 --> 01:02:11,971
you're gay,
you're gay,

1518
01:02:11,971 --> 01:02:13,590
you get slaps on the back,
you get applause.

1519
01:02:13,591 --> 01:02:14,101
You get,
Oh whoa.

1520
01:02:14,101 --> 01:02:15,320
Is Me Brave?
You know,

1521
01:02:15,510 --> 01:02:16,343
all of the sick,
all of the social signaling about being 

1522
01:02:17,461 --> 01:02:21,210
homosexual is positive with one.
If you're a conservative other gays,

1523
01:02:21,211 --> 01:02:24,810
the gay establishment and brainstorm 
notice wrote an amazing essay about this

1524
01:02:24,811 --> 01:02:25,644
in out magazine.
It's called something like in the rain 

1525
01:02:26,911 --> 01:02:29,100
and the magical gail that everybody 
should read.

1526
01:02:29,110 --> 01:02:29,943
It explains how the gay establishment,
which is basically now done with gays 

1527
01:02:33,721 --> 01:02:38,350
and it's sort of a self perpetuating a 
set of institutions to,

1528
01:02:38,520 --> 01:02:39,353
to push leftist socialist principles.
Got nothing to do with gay rights 

1529
01:02:41,071 --> 01:02:42,360
anymore.
Um,

1530
01:02:42,660 --> 01:02:46,470
we'll treat you as what you would call 
an uncle Tom in race terms.

1531
01:02:46,770 --> 01:02:47,371
Um,
you know,

1532
01:02:47,371 --> 01:02:51,060
I have never in my career as a 
purposeful provocateur.

1533
01:02:51,061 --> 01:02:53,280
I don't play the victim on twitter or in
my columns because,

1534
01:02:53,281 --> 01:02:54,114
you know,
I think you should,

1535
01:02:54,220 --> 01:02:57,750
if you should take as well as you gave 
them a rule,

1536
01:02:57,751 --> 01:02:59,840
all gay people on quite early in life.
Um,

1537
01:03:00,150 --> 01:03:01,650
but you think that one thing

1538
01:03:02,090 --> 01:03:04,760
that's shifting,

1539
01:03:04,800 --> 01:03:06,950
yeah,
it's a really long quietly.

1540
01:03:07,020 --> 01:03:07,741
Uh,
no,

1541
01:03:07,741 --> 01:03:08,750
it's,
you know,

1542
01:03:09,510 --> 01:03:11,500
I think you should be able to take it as
given.

1543
01:03:11,501 --> 01:03:12,334
And I never played the victim,
but I've never had so much really 

1544
01:03:15,721 --> 01:03:16,554
poisonous vitriolic nastiness as from 
other gays who think that my politics 

1545
01:03:20,131 --> 01:03:20,964
are wrong.

1546
01:03:21,630 --> 01:03:23,760
It's horrible.
What did the ultimate success here?

1547
01:03:23,761 --> 01:03:24,594
But you know,
I've been arguing for a while now that 

1548
01:03:25,681 --> 01:03:27,900
by gay marriage being legal now in 
America,

1549
01:03:27,901 --> 01:03:28,820
in the,
in the longterm,

1550
01:03:28,830 --> 01:03:29,663
you actually help the Republicans 
because this was such an idiotic issue 

1551
01:03:32,491 --> 01:03:36,400
for so many people have to vote us,
is the idea that I had to vote on it.

1552
01:03:36,450 --> 01:03:38,280
Not that,
not that it was the deciding factor,

1553
01:03:38,400 --> 01:03:39,233
but it was,
I had to vote on whether I could get 

1554
01:03:40,561 --> 01:03:42,920
married.
It's a fucking nonsensical and,

1555
01:03:42,921 --> 01:03:43,754
and painful and pathetic way to vote.
So I actually think ultimately this may 

1556
01:03:46,861 --> 01:03:48,780
turn into a net win for the Republicans 
because

1557
01:03:49,880 --> 01:03:51,650
I'm not sure that's the case now.
I've written about this,

1558
01:03:51,651 --> 01:03:53,520
and I call it minority,
was the way in which,

1559
01:03:53,521 --> 01:03:54,354
you know,
if the last 10 years was about setting 

1560
01:03:55,221 --> 01:03:56,054
men and women against each other,
the next 10 years about all sorts of 

1561
01:03:57,231 --> 01:03:58,510
other minorities.
I mean,

1562
01:03:58,690 --> 01:03:59,523
when the Hispanic population in the US 
who are not encumbered by the guilt of 

1563
01:04:02,001 --> 01:04:05,240
slavery become the,
the demographic majority,

1564
01:04:05,241 --> 01:04:08,210
you're going to see some pretty brutal 
policing in places like Ferguson.

1565
01:04:08,570 --> 01:04:09,410
Um,
you know,

1566
01:04:09,411 --> 01:04:12,320
because they don't have the same kind of
white middle class guilt about,

1567
01:04:12,620 --> 01:04:13,460
uh,
about,

1568
01:04:13,490 --> 01:04:14,540
you know,
black lives matter.

1569
01:04:14,541 --> 01:04:15,374
They weren't,
you know,

1570
01:04:15,530 --> 01:04:18,920
Hispanic mayors in barely a few 
generations.

1571
01:04:18,921 --> 01:04:21,920
I'm not going to be paying multimillion 
dollar settlements to black families.

1572
01:04:21,921 --> 01:04:23,480
They're gonna be sending police in with 
guns.

1573
01:04:23,710 --> 01:04:24,680
Um,
you know,

1574
01:04:24,690 --> 01:04:25,610
it's,
it's,

1575
01:04:25,760 --> 01:04:26,593
there's all sorts of horrible things on 
the horizon and it's driven by the 

1576
01:04:28,761 --> 01:04:31,670
identity politics of the left,
which are crumbling but not fast enough.

1577
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:37,000
My serious point about all of this is 
that cultural libertarianism or should I

1578
01:04:37,701 --> 01:04:39,320
keep banging on about,
which I think is what we've sort of what

1579
01:04:39,321 --> 01:04:40,154
we've been talking about,
which is a word that I'm glad is 

1580
01:04:42,290 --> 01:04:43,950
catching on with people.
Can we just do it?

1581
01:04:44,150 --> 01:04:44,983
I know you named a few of them before,
but if from the article that I saw on 

1582
01:04:46,581 --> 01:04:48,110
Breitbart,
I know that it was a brilliant article.

1583
01:04:48,111 --> 01:04:49,670
We'll link to it.
It wasn't like either way,

1584
01:04:49,671 --> 01:04:50,504
but.
But can we just name a couple of these 

1585
01:04:51,441 --> 01:04:52,274
people?
I know you named a few,

1586
01:04:52,960 --> 01:04:54,010
but Bill Maher was included.

1587
01:04:55,490 --> 01:04:57,920
Chris rock is in there even though he 
does rely a lot on his,

1588
01:04:57,950 --> 01:05:00,200
on his blackness as a source of his 
comedy.

1589
01:05:00,201 --> 01:05:01,950
He noted that he is somebody,
for example,

1590
01:05:01,951 --> 01:05:02,784
who's spoken up about the political 
correctness or colleges and college 

1591
01:05:05,181 --> 01:05:06,014
campuses and says you won't perform for 
students anymore because they're too 

1592
01:05:07,881 --> 01:05:10,010
touchy.
I think he understands this.

1593
01:05:10,011 --> 01:05:11,000
I think Eli Roth,
the,

1594
01:05:11,001 --> 01:05:12,860
uh,
the horror director,

1595
01:05:13,410 --> 01:05:17,010
Adam Baldwin,
who's a sort of a fancy actor and um,

1596
01:05:17,100 --> 01:05:18,640
he said,
I'm not with the Gamergate stuff.

1597
01:05:18,641 --> 01:05:21,370
And then you've got the way these things
normally work because you've got sort of

1598
01:05:21,371 --> 01:05:22,204
vanguard of hell races like me and Katie
Hopkins in the UK and Coulter perhaps 

1599
01:05:26,381 --> 01:05:27,730
here,
um,

1600
01:05:27,790 --> 01:05:29,710
now that all those,
those three happened to be right wing.

1601
01:05:29,711 --> 01:05:30,544
But I don't think it's,
I don't think you can play well that 

1602
01:05:31,710 --> 01:05:33,430
thing you can place people in the 
political spectrum.

1603
01:05:33,430 --> 01:05:34,263
And that's why I wanted you to mention 
some of the names because what I liked 

1604
01:05:36,041 --> 01:05:38,020
about the article was that these people 
were from all over.

1605
01:05:38,110 --> 01:05:38,943
I think the hell raisers tends to be a 
conservative today simply because the 

1606
01:05:41,681 --> 01:05:43,090
establishment is liberal.
Right?

1607
01:05:43,140 --> 01:05:43,973
And I think that's why then a further 
behind that you've got the more 

1608
01:05:46,511 --> 01:05:47,344
politically ambiguous figures like 
Christina Hoff summers at the American 

1609
01:05:49,600 --> 01:05:51,270
Enterprise Institute or Cathy young 
feminist journalist,

1610
01:05:51,470 --> 01:05:54,490
um,
who aren't so easy to place politically.

1611
01:05:54,700 --> 01:05:56,680
Kathy's definitely a liberal,
I think Christina is.

1612
01:05:56,830 --> 01:05:58,090
Christina is a registered Democrat,
in fact,

1613
01:05:58,390 --> 01:05:59,223
um,
you know,

1614
01:05:59,230 --> 01:06:02,680
but who nonetheless recognize the 
excesses and they sort of in the wake of

1615
01:06:02,681 --> 01:06:03,514
the chaos created by the hell raisers 
that people like me kind of winding 

1616
01:06:06,011 --> 01:06:07,520
people up and being,
you know,

1617
01:06:07,900 --> 01:06:08,733
sort of viciously teasing people I 
consider to be dangerous and damaging 

1618
01:06:11,561 --> 01:06:13,060
and whatever.
Leave half of it.

1619
01:06:13,060 --> 01:06:14,160
But you're throwing bombs.
No,

1620
01:06:14,170 --> 01:06:14,440
no,
no.

1621
01:06:14,440 --> 01:06:16,390
I believe all of it.
I believe all of it,

1622
01:06:16,420 --> 01:06:17,253
but I'm perfectly happy to accept that I
will say at the most productive way 

1623
01:06:19,511 --> 01:06:20,680
possible.
Um,

1624
01:06:20,710 --> 01:06:24,010
because I think the only responsible,
the only appropriate response to outrage

1625
01:06:24,011 --> 01:06:25,180
culture is to be outrageous.
You know,

1626
01:06:25,181 --> 01:06:27,160
if you're going to tell me that I can't 
make jokes about,

1627
01:06:27,250 --> 01:06:30,150
about skin color,
I will come back at you,

1628
01:06:30,180 --> 01:06:31,090
you know,
with,

1629
01:06:31,140 --> 01:06:34,780
with 10 poems about me being obsessed 
with black penises or whatever.

1630
01:06:34,781 --> 01:06:35,531
You know,
for the record,

1631
01:06:35,531 --> 01:06:38,810
you brought a six foot six black porn 
star.

1632
01:06:41,010 --> 01:06:41,843
I hired,
I hired a black porn star just because 

1633
01:06:43,991 --> 01:06:46,660
it would annoy the right people to be my
bodyguard because I get.

1634
01:06:46,670 --> 01:06:48,310
But I get death and bomb threats 
everywhere I go.

1635
01:06:48,311 --> 01:06:49,144
And I didn't make a big song and dance 
about accept to laugh at how stupid it 

1636
01:06:52,041 --> 01:06:54,490
is when I didn't believe any feminist 
bomb threats ever going to be credible.

1637
01:06:54,491 --> 01:06:56,080
They're kind of in Tyler and shoelaces 
together,

1638
01:06:56,081 --> 01:06:56,914
let alone wire a detonator.
I'm not worried about getting blown up 

1639
01:06:59,801 --> 01:07:01,420
by feminists.
Um,

1640
01:07:01,480 --> 01:07:02,590
what I,
what I,

1641
01:07:02,650 --> 01:07:03,483
uh,
am worried about is the chilling effect 

1642
01:07:04,601 --> 01:07:07,000
that they have on free speech.
And just get back to the point.

1643
01:07:07,001 --> 01:07:08,530
Yeah,
I'm gay people,

1644
01:07:08,531 --> 01:07:09,364
I think,
and I think this is something in which 

1645
01:07:10,091 --> 01:07:11,860
you and I are united,
uh,

1646
01:07:11,890 --> 01:07:14,440
having privileged access if you'd like 
to,

1647
01:07:14,500 --> 01:07:15,333
you know,
the limits of acceptable speech and 

1648
01:07:16,811 --> 01:07:17,740
discourse.
There's that great,

1649
01:07:18,010 --> 01:07:19,840
that great drag Queen Joke,
you know,

1650
01:07:21,190 --> 01:07:22,070
which I love from,
uh,

1651
01:07:22,120 --> 01:07:22,953
from Britain,
which always gets shocks and a national 

1652
01:07:25,061 --> 01:07:27,010
newspaper wouldn't let me publish,
which was,

1653
01:07:27,070 --> 01:07:29,500
um,
she comes on stage and she says,

1654
01:07:29,501 --> 01:07:30,190
you're like my new hair.

1655
01:07:30,190 --> 01:07:32,230
It's called the Whitney black and died 
in the bath.

1656
01:07:33,380 --> 01:07:34,420
And we will get,
sort of horrified.

1657
01:07:34,440 --> 01:07:36,480
But yeah,
it gave,

1658
01:07:36,490 --> 01:07:38,750
gave people live and love though,
you know,

1659
01:07:38,770 --> 01:07:41,950
that sort of stuff.
And we see before everybody else,

1660
01:07:41,980 --> 01:07:42,813
you know,
what the serious consequences of this 

1661
01:07:44,081 --> 01:07:46,510
sort of chilling effect on free speech 
can be and those consequences are,

1662
01:07:46,570 --> 01:07:46,870
there's,
you know,

1663
01:07:46,870 --> 01:07:49,300
the sum total of human human knowledge 
and whatever,

1664
01:07:49,310 --> 01:07:50,560
you know,
starting to be caught off.

1665
01:07:50,740 --> 01:07:54,820
Js mill classical liberal is 
unconscionable to modern feminism.

1666
01:07:54,821 --> 01:07:59,320
They don't believe some of the central 
tenants of know on which British society

1667
01:07:59,321 --> 01:08:01,570
was built.
This is dangerous stuff.

1668
01:08:01,760 --> 01:08:04,570
It's dangerous stuff because of what's 
happening in universities too.

1669
01:08:04,870 --> 01:08:06,400
I mean,
just look at the sorts of,

1670
01:08:06,430 --> 01:08:07,220
you know,
look at the,

1671
01:08:07,220 --> 01:08:10,870
the feminists hegemony,
you know,

1672
01:08:10,871 --> 01:08:12,370
women's studies departments that,
you know,

1673
01:08:12,380 --> 01:08:14,440
that run rampant on campuses.
Yale,

1674
01:08:14,800 --> 01:08:16,010
I don't know if this,
I hope

1675
01:08:16,010 --> 01:08:18,470
this is true and I'm not,
I'm misremembering this,

1676
01:08:18,471 --> 01:08:20,270
but I saw something,
you know,

1677
01:08:20,300 --> 01:08:22,400
Deray Mckesson,
the black lives matter.

1678
01:08:22,401 --> 01:08:25,340
This guy is teaching a course at Yale 
and defensive looting,

1679
01:08:25,341 --> 01:08:26,220
you know,
all this kind of stuff.

1680
01:08:26,221 --> 01:08:27,900
This is a weird,
crazy.

1681
01:08:27,910 --> 01:08:30,050
So tweet about that.
I don't know if it's real,

1682
01:08:30,051 --> 01:08:34,010
we'll see.
But the women's studies suffered,

1683
01:08:34,260 --> 01:08:36,800
you know,
many decent universities is scary.

1684
01:08:37,170 --> 01:08:39,330
It's denying human knowledge is making 
people.

1685
01:08:39,331 --> 01:08:41,960
And been this stuff makes it to 
government policy regarding match.

1686
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:43,400
You're not just talking about women's 
studies though,

1687
01:08:43,401 --> 01:08:44,570
because this is coming from all over the
place,

1688
01:08:44,571 --> 01:08:48,500
like Berkeley Protesting Bill Maher 
coming as a progressive ISM.

1689
01:08:48,530 --> 01:08:50,260
Generally.
I have a,

1690
01:08:50,500 --> 01:08:51,333
I've just seen,
I'm supposed to speak at USC tomorrow 

1691
01:08:52,551 --> 01:08:54,710
night and I've just seen,
um,

1692
01:08:54,800 --> 01:08:55,633
you know,
this horrendous blog post from somebody 

1693
01:08:58,011 --> 01:09:00,620
who says that I'm a sort of misogynistic
hate speech much.

1694
01:09:00,621 --> 01:09:04,040
And because I made a joke about,
I didn't know what it was.

1695
01:09:04,040 --> 01:09:05,360
It's probably some joke like,
you know,

1696
01:09:05,840 --> 01:09:08,100
feminist barbies just come out when you 
pull the cord.

1697
01:09:08,101 --> 01:09:09,860
It says math is hard.
Let's lie about rape.

1698
01:09:10,090 --> 01:09:10,870
Um,
you know,

1699
01:09:10,870 --> 01:09:12,020
some,
some joke like that,

1700
01:09:12,660 --> 01:09:13,311
you know,
and they.

1701
01:09:13,311 --> 01:09:16,430
And they picked me out some sort of 
misogynistic worth their words.

1702
01:09:16,431 --> 01:09:17,264
People.
I think that the takeaway and that 

1703
01:09:17,621 --> 01:09:20,820
that's really where I sort of wanted to 
end this with you because yeah,

1704
01:09:20,870 --> 01:09:21,703
we can.
Everything I've tried to do with this 

1705
01:09:23,021 --> 01:09:26,600
show so far is show that you can 
disagree with people and we can,

1706
01:09:26,630 --> 01:09:30,860
we can go back and argue the tenants of 
feminism or whether I think you're right

1707
01:09:30,861 --> 01:09:33,320
or wrong about men being oppressed or,
or,

1708
01:09:33,321 --> 01:09:35,150
or the,
the gay marriage thing,

1709
01:09:35,151 --> 01:09:36,680
all those things,
uh,

1710
01:09:36,950 --> 01:09:39,350
but,
but allow the conversation to happen and

1711
01:09:39,351 --> 01:09:40,184
I think that's what's happening and 
that's what the cultural libertarians 

1712
01:09:42,201 --> 01:09:43,400
they were talking about are trying to 
do.

1713
01:09:43,640 --> 01:09:47,210
We're trying to have the conversation.
So I appreciate you coming in and I want

1714
01:09:47,211 --> 01:09:49,970
to thank my guest,
Milo Yiannopoulos were dropping by.

1715
01:09:49,971 --> 01:09:52,480
You can check out his work 
over@Breitbart.com.

1716
01:09:52,640 --> 01:09:54,380
Follow them on twitter.
It's at Nero.

1717
01:09:54,470 --> 01:09:54,891
I,
by the way,

1718
01:09:54,891 --> 01:09:55,724
make sure to tag me in all the hate 
tweets because I know there's going to 

1719
01:09:57,801 --> 01:09:58,634
be a lot of them.
It's at Rubin report and we'll do this 

1720
01:10:00,381 --> 01:10:01,214
again next.
