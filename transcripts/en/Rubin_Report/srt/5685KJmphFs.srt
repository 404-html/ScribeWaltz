1
00:00:05,060 --> 00:00:05,893
Joining me today is an author,
a professor in evolutionary behavioral 

2
00:00:09,111 --> 00:00:09,944
scientist,
a man who wears a bow tie when speaking 

3
00:00:11,571 --> 00:00:14,890
to the Canadian parliament and a guy 
with an incredible tan,

4
00:00:14,900 --> 00:00:17,240
Gaad Saad.
Welcome back to the Rubin report.

5
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:18,650
So nice to be back.
Thanks Dave.

6
00:00:18,820 --> 00:00:22,090
The Tan,
I don't know that our cameras,

7
00:00:22,100 --> 00:00:26,460
I don't know the new tube through the 
wires and the tubes or whatever.

8
00:00:26,461 --> 00:00:29,540
It gets it out to the people.
I don't know that it can take that level

9
00:00:29,541 --> 00:00:31,760
of 10.
They're just you being next to me.

10
00:00:31,761 --> 00:00:35,600
You're going to get that?
I hope so because I've never felt whiter

11
00:00:35,601 --> 00:00:38,570
than I feel right now.
That is that good Lebanese skin that you

12
00:00:38,571 --> 00:00:40,210
had as A.
Alright,

13
00:00:40,250 --> 00:00:43,520
so you've been on the show many times.
You were my.

14
00:00:43,570 --> 00:00:46,850
My first year on the first test show of 
the Rubin report.

15
00:00:46,851 --> 00:00:48,530
You were on the first panel we ever did.

16
00:00:48,530 --> 00:00:52,430
We've done one on ones a couple times 
from getting to know you.

17
00:00:52,431 --> 00:00:53,264
You have just been in sort of what I 
would call the fight that is happening 

18
00:00:56,721 --> 00:00:58,010
now.
The free speech fight,

19
00:00:58,040 --> 00:01:01,900
the fight for enlightenment values for 
liberal values.

20
00:01:01,970 --> 00:01:03,370
The whole thing,
uh,

21
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:04,313
but I thought a nice way to start would 
be you would happen to be on vacation 

22
00:01:06,681 --> 00:01:07,500
right now,
right?

23
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:10,730
You were in the midst of a five weeks,
so cal vacation.

24
00:01:11,060 --> 00:01:16,060
And how important is that when you are 
someone that puts yourself out there all

25
00:01:16,611 --> 00:01:17,271
the time?
As I said,

26
00:01:17,271 --> 00:01:20,480
you just spoke to Canadian parliament.
You were at Google doing a talk.

27
00:01:20,481 --> 00:01:22,280
I mean just as someone that's always out
there.

28
00:01:22,550 --> 00:01:23,780
The shutdown.
How important.

29
00:01:23,781 --> 00:01:25,070
Very important.
Although I am,

30
00:01:25,130 --> 00:01:25,963
I've done a few shows while I'm here,
so there's a bit of work interspersed 

31
00:01:28,970 --> 00:01:31,400
within the vacation.
It's terribly important.

32
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:32,233
Not so much for going to the beach,
but for disconnecting from being 

33
00:01:35,030 --> 00:01:35,863
available to the public now.
I always promised my wife that I will 

34
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:44,780
absolutely not check a single social 
media and then usually that lasts three,

35
00:01:44,781 --> 00:01:45,614
four,
five days and then I succumb to the 

36
00:01:46,791 --> 00:01:47,624
temptation,
but that I think is fundamentally the 

37
00:01:49,971 --> 00:01:50,804
most important part of my vacation,
which is to not weigh in every hour on 

38
00:01:54,201 --> 00:01:56,480
twitter to just disconnect.
Yeah.

39
00:01:56,481 --> 00:01:57,314
And so profoundly important.
How do you balance between the academic 

40
00:02:00,681 --> 00:02:03,590
things that you care about and all the 
stuff that we're going to talk about for

41
00:02:03,591 --> 00:02:04,424
the,
for the next hour or so and just being 

42
00:02:06,801 --> 00:02:07,634
human because I feel like that's what 
people are having trouble dealing with 

43
00:02:09,561 --> 00:02:10,394
and I,
I mean that from people that work blue 

44
00:02:11,271 --> 00:02:14,570
collar jobs to people that are doing 
high level math stuff.

45
00:02:14,571 --> 00:02:15,404
I feel like people are having trouble 
separating like just all the noise from 

46
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:20,233
reality.

47
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:22,700
So I basically have,
professionally speaking,

48
00:02:22,701 --> 00:02:26,570
I have two hats that I wear that have a 
professor with all that that entails,

49
00:02:26,930 --> 00:02:30,110
which if I only did that,
it would keep me busy 18 hours a day.

50
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:32,810
And then there is my public intellectual
hat that I wear,

51
00:02:33,230 --> 00:02:35,150
uh,
over the past few years.

52
00:02:35,151 --> 00:02:39,620
I feel that a large part of my time has 
been taken up by the ladder.

53
00:02:40,010 --> 00:02:41,840
And now I'm trying to kind of reign that
in.

54
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:47,520
So to still remain a viable voice and 
the battle of public ideas.

55
00:02:48,050 --> 00:02:51,260
But I need to sort of go back to some of
the fundamentals,

56
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:52,233
the lab stuff.
Not that I've ever given it a given it 

57
00:02:53,721 --> 00:02:56,450
up,
but it takes time as you know,

58
00:02:56,451 --> 00:02:57,800
right.
To build an audience,

59
00:02:57,801 --> 00:02:59,980
to get people excited what you have to 
say.

60
00:03:00,190 --> 00:03:03,850
It takes a lot of effort and so I don't 
think I have the magical recipe yet,

61
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:06,610
but I try to every day do a bit of both.

62
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:08,470
Yeah.
When you made that shift,

63
00:03:08,471 --> 00:03:11,140
which probably was right around when I 
met you,

64
00:03:11,170 --> 00:03:12,003
met whatever we did on twitter,
however you connect with someone on 

65
00:03:13,661 --> 00:03:16,660
twitter or know whatever that is now,
four years ago or so,

66
00:03:17,110 --> 00:03:17,943
when you made that sort of shift from 
academic to someone that was going to 

67
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:21,993
speak their mind publicly and fight with
people publicly and make videos and 

68
00:03:24,671 --> 00:03:29,060
interviews and all that stuff.
Did you realize how much of a,

69
00:03:29,170 --> 00:03:30,840
not not just a time suck,
but a,

70
00:03:30,841 --> 00:03:31,610
a,
a,

71
00:03:31,610 --> 00:03:33,610
an important piece of your life?
It was going to become.

72
00:03:33,820 --> 00:03:35,010
I didn't,
uh,

73
00:03:35,050 --> 00:03:36,370
you know,
I'm very much of a purist,

74
00:03:36,371 --> 00:03:38,590
so I'm just excited by things like a 
child.

75
00:03:38,591 --> 00:03:39,424
Right?
So I discovered that there's this thing 

76
00:03:41,351 --> 00:03:42,184
called social media that allows me to 
advertise my ideas with all sorts of 

77
00:03:45,551 --> 00:03:46,384
people,
meet people that I would have otherwise 

78
00:03:47,831 --> 00:03:49,840
never meet,
like Dave Rubin and countless others,

79
00:03:49,990 --> 00:03:53,440
even random strangers that I get to meet
who sent me beautiful gifts and I get to

80
00:03:53,441 --> 00:03:54,274
know them well,
who selling me stuff that's personal in 

81
00:03:56,381 --> 00:03:57,010
their lives.

82
00:03:57,010 --> 00:03:58,600
So I never thought that that would be 
possible,

83
00:03:58,601 --> 00:04:01,510
but I'm amazed at the power of the 
medium.

84
00:04:02,770 --> 00:04:04,720
And I don't say this in an arrogant 
manner,

85
00:04:04,721 --> 00:04:05,554
just walking down the street and 
probably you get this probably 10 times 

86
00:04:07,961 --> 00:04:11,410
more than I do.
The number of people who recognize you,

87
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:13,730
who come up to you,
who say they love your work,

88
00:04:13,731 --> 00:04:14,390
who fought,
you know,

89
00:04:14,390 --> 00:04:16,520
we can be on the beach and I'll be 
stopped with that.

90
00:04:16,630 --> 00:04:18,850
I can be in a bathroom and someone will 
say,

91
00:04:18,851 --> 00:04:19,900
Hey,
Godfather.

92
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:23,010
And so that's nothing worse than that.
When Your pee against somebody,

93
00:04:23,020 --> 00:04:24,690
the guy next to you,
it's like I'm,

94
00:04:24,691 --> 00:04:26,650
I'm a.
But that,

95
00:04:27,030 --> 00:04:28,240
I,
I look at that with,

96
00:04:28,330 --> 00:04:29,990
with a bit of humility in that,
uh,

97
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:32,530
it's incredible that we have these 
platforms,

98
00:04:32,531 --> 00:04:34,000
which five,
10 years ago,

99
00:04:34,270 --> 00:04:37,000
a guy like me and academia I could have 
never hoped to have.

100
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,680
And so it's been wonderful.
It's been a blessing.

101
00:04:38,710 --> 00:04:39,543
Yeah.
Is there a real silver lining to 

102
00:04:40,871 --> 00:04:41,704
everything that's going on now,
which is people feel like everyone's 

103
00:04:44,051 --> 00:04:46,000
dumber and fighting all the time.
And you know,

104
00:04:46,001 --> 00:04:46,834
I'm a firm believer that most of us,
80 percent of us want the same simple 

105
00:04:50,231 --> 00:04:51,064
things into live decent lives and,
and have some food and have some money 

106
00:04:53,971 --> 00:04:56,260
and be able to go on vacation and have 
some sex and just whatever,

107
00:04:56,261 --> 00:04:59,710
whatever those basics are.
But the silver lining,

108
00:04:59,711 --> 00:05:00,544
while it sounds so crazy,
but obviously if people are recognizing 

109
00:05:03,161 --> 00:05:04,660
you and rewarding you for the work you 
do,

110
00:05:04,661 --> 00:05:07,460
it shows that there is an intellectual 
thirst stays.

111
00:05:07,540 --> 00:05:09,430
It's not being given to you by the 
mainstream media,

112
00:05:09,431 --> 00:05:11,590
but it shows that it's out there.
Absolutely.

113
00:05:11,591 --> 00:05:14,530
And I mean,
shows like that are not mainstream.

114
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:15,753
Uh,
I think eventually this will be the 

115
00:05:17,321 --> 00:05:17,930
mainstream.

116
00:05:17,930 --> 00:05:18,770
Uh,
it,

117
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:23,620
it amazes me how the mainstream media 
has sort of doubled down,

118
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:24,581
you know,
to,

119
00:05:24,581 --> 00:05:26,210
to use a term that we might talk about 
later,

120
00:05:26,211 --> 00:05:27,044
had ostrich logic,
but then sand and refuse to sort of 

121
00:05:29,831 --> 00:05:33,250
recognize some of the dynamics.
A look,

122
00:05:33,550 --> 00:05:35,860
anything that promotes more discussion 
is great.

123
00:05:35,861 --> 00:05:38,740
I only wish that people were sometimes a
bit nicer,

124
00:05:41,030 --> 00:05:44,820
but perhaps they haven't evolved to be 
nicer,

125
00:05:44,850 --> 00:05:47,560
but maybe that's,
that should be your next book.

126
00:05:47,590 --> 00:05:50,980
Maybe that's your mission of evil 
online.

127
00:05:51,350 --> 00:05:52,300
I mean,
I think we,

128
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:54,340
we both,
most of the time do this,

129
00:05:54,341 --> 00:05:55,810
right.
We're able to brush it off,

130
00:05:56,170 --> 00:05:57,890
but it takes a,
it takes a toll.

131
00:05:57,891 --> 00:05:59,850
You know,
reading about your,

132
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:01,400
in my case,
my weight,

133
00:06:01,430 --> 00:06:02,950
my Judaism,
my.

134
00:06:03,580 --> 00:06:05,540
I mean it's just endless.
You know,

135
00:06:05,541 --> 00:06:07,910
a nasty things that are written about 
you.

136
00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:09,133
I wish people would recognize that both 
of us and many of us will play in this 

137
00:06:12,741 --> 00:06:15,590
marketplace of idea,
are really doing it with pure research,

138
00:06:15,950 --> 00:06:18,470
pure reasons to contribute to a 
discussion.

139
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:20,690
And if people could learn to be a bit 
nicer,

140
00:06:20,780 --> 00:06:22,940
we would all be richer for it.
Yeah.

141
00:06:22,941 --> 00:06:24,200
I mean,
I wish it,

142
00:06:24,650 --> 00:06:26,930
but I don't sense that coming down the 
pike.

143
00:06:27,020 --> 00:06:27,853
All right,
so we're gonna we're gonna do a lot of 

144
00:06:28,251 --> 00:06:29,084
stuff here,
but I think just first because it 

145
00:06:30,290 --> 00:06:32,870
couches everything else on the free 
speech front,

146
00:06:32,871 --> 00:06:35,960
you've become one of the few people that
I know of,

147
00:06:35,961 --> 00:06:39,830
at least on the public side in Canada 
that are really fighting the free speech

148
00:06:39,831 --> 00:06:40,431
battle.
Of course,

149
00:06:40,431 --> 00:06:43,520
the real high profile guy also is Jordan
Peterson.

150
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:44,673
Uh,
and also at the academic level of 

151
00:06:45,771 --> 00:06:47,150
course,
um,

152
00:06:48,140 --> 00:06:50,690
what is happening in Canada right now?
I mean,

153
00:06:50,691 --> 00:06:51,524
it,
it seems pretty scary actually when you 

154
00:06:53,091 --> 00:06:55,400
hear some of this stuff.
Uh,

155
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:59,780
Canada I think is desperately trying to 
become the number one,

156
00:06:59,870 --> 00:07:00,703
a social justice warrior country in the 
world that's trying to catch up to 

157
00:07:03,051 --> 00:07:03,884
Germany and Sweden and part because we 
have a prime minister who very much a 

158
00:07:08,330 --> 00:07:09,920
epitomizes those positions.

159
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:14,920
And so the endless tsunami of these 
types of positions are difficult to keep

160
00:07:15,411 --> 00:07:17,510
up with.
You mentioned earlier that,

161
00:07:17,570 --> 00:07:18,403
uh,
I had appeared in front of the Canadian 

162
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:21,590
Senate to testify.
Maybe I could mention this very briefly.

163
00:07:21,950 --> 00:07:22,783
So there's a bit,
and you're here to tell me what you 

164
00:07:23,991 --> 00:07:24,824
think don't even have this.
Bill is a bill that has now since 

165
00:07:29,211 --> 00:07:30,044
passed.
Both Jordan Peterson and I are in 

166
00:07:32,301 --> 00:07:36,920
separate sessions,
had been asked to appear to discuss some

167
00:07:36,921 --> 00:07:37,754
of our concerns with the bill.
The bill basically refers to 

168
00:07:39,771 --> 00:07:40,604
incorporating gender identity and gender
expression within hate crime laws that 

169
00:07:45,981 --> 00:07:48,740
if you target someone based on their 
gender identity or gender expression,

170
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:51,770
then it's hateful.
And so then I guess the penalty,

171
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:52,633
the penalty would be ratcheted up a.
and I appeared in front of the Canadian 

172
00:07:55,940 --> 00:07:56,773
Senate to basically argue that the way 
that it was worded is so vague and 

173
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:04,910
potentially so dangerous that literally 
anything that I teach in my evolutionary

174
00:08:04,911 --> 00:08:07,750
psychology courses could be construed as
quote,

175
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:09,560
transphobic,
systemic violence.

176
00:08:10,020 --> 00:08:10,853
Uh,
and the reason why I say quotes because 

177
00:08:12,081 --> 00:08:12,914
those are terms that a harvard pamphlet,
the LGBTQ office at Harvard had put out 

178
00:08:17,601 --> 00:08:22,601
a pamphlet where they argued that people
who support a quilt,

179
00:08:23,481 --> 00:08:27,440
fixed binaries and biological 
essentialism fixed binaries is male,

180
00:08:27,441 --> 00:08:27,951
female,
male,

181
00:08:27,951 --> 00:08:28,784
female.
A biological essentialism is arguing 

182
00:08:30,471 --> 00:08:31,304
that they are,
you know,

183
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:33,740
biological realities,
evolved realities,

184
00:08:34,070 --> 00:08:34,903
innate sex differences.
If you promulgate these types of 

185
00:08:37,431 --> 00:08:40,820
position,
you are actually engaging in quote Trans

186
00:08:40,821 --> 00:08:42,530
phobic systemic violence.
That's not,

187
00:08:42,680 --> 00:08:44,660
that's not allegorical,
metaphorical.

188
00:08:44,661 --> 00:08:47,570
You literally are being transphobic,
really violent,

189
00:08:47,900 --> 00:08:48,733
and so I argued that anything that I say
in my course when I walk into my course 

190
00:08:51,381 --> 00:08:52,214
and introduced the concept of sexual 
selection and how sex specific traits 

191
00:08:55,831 --> 00:08:56,664
evolve,
and I only use words like male and 

192
00:08:58,771 --> 00:08:59,604
female,
I don't refer to the non binary and non 

193
00:09:01,181 --> 00:09:04,530
gender and so on.
So any person in the room could say,

194
00:09:04,531 --> 00:09:05,364
hey,
and a 13 week course you never once 

195
00:09:07,111 --> 00:09:08,520
recognized my personhood.

196
00:09:08,670 --> 00:09:10,770
You're engaging in Trans phobic systemic
violence.

197
00:09:11,010 --> 00:09:11,843
The answer to this very sober,
a presentation that I gave was that one 

198
00:09:15,751 --> 00:09:16,584
of the Canadian senators accused me of 
being pro genocide and where did that 

199
00:09:21,860 --> 00:09:22,693
come from?
Because apparently the fact that I was 

200
00:09:24,481 --> 00:09:29,481
not supporting the bill somehow through 
a Gargantuan leap of logic,

201
00:09:31,020 --> 00:09:31,853
you know,
I want it to feather and tar or 

202
00:09:33,241 --> 00:09:34,074
transgender people and I,
I specifically argued that all people 

203
00:09:36,541 --> 00:09:38,640
deserve to be treated equally under the 
law,

204
00:09:38,970 --> 00:09:42,210
but we don't have to uniquely celebrate 
your personhood,

205
00:09:42,450 --> 00:09:43,283
right?
There's a distinction between treating 

206
00:09:45,061 --> 00:09:45,894
you as an equal member of society and 
having to go an extra mile to uniquely 

207
00:09:49,111 --> 00:09:51,300
celebrate your personal.
I'll give you another example.

208
00:09:51,620 --> 00:09:54,930
Canada wanted to now create a gender 
neutral society.

209
00:09:55,260 --> 00:09:58,980
So the idea being that the marker male 
or female,

210
00:09:58,981 --> 00:09:59,814
say on official government documents 
should be removed because that small 

211
00:10:04,051 --> 00:10:05,730
percentage,
less than one percent,

212
00:10:05,731 --> 00:10:06,564
substantially less than one percent who 
consider themselves non-gendered or 

213
00:10:09,391 --> 00:10:10,224
nonbinary.

214
00:10:10,420 --> 00:10:14,670
We are going to feel marginalized by 
having to write male or female.

215
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:15,713
So 99 point nine percent of a population
should lose in identifying marker that 

216
00:10:21,661 --> 00:10:24,150
is part of their personhood.
I am a male.

217
00:10:24,690 --> 00:10:27,690
I have a child that's mail.
I have a daughter that's female.

218
00:10:27,750 --> 00:10:28,583
I'm married to a woman that's female.
All of these things should be removed 

219
00:10:31,710 --> 00:10:35,130
because someone might be marginalized by
that biological reality.

220
00:10:35,131 --> 00:10:37,290
It's insanity.
So for someone like you that,

221
00:10:37,350 --> 00:10:38,183
that builds in academia,
but more importantly that deal in the 

222
00:10:40,621 --> 00:10:43,280
realm of science and you have to base 
things on fact,

223
00:10:43,290 --> 00:10:46,260
this is actually a direct assault on you
in a certain way.

224
00:10:46,261 --> 00:10:47,180
Right?
Like you're in,

225
00:10:47,670 --> 00:10:49,500
you're talking about something that's 
important societal issue,

226
00:10:49,501 --> 00:10:50,334
but really it's rational self interest.
You want to be able to do your job that 

227
00:10:53,011 --> 00:10:53,844
you have been trained to do at the 
highest level without having outside 

228
00:10:57,871 --> 00:10:58,210
fear.

229
00:10:58,210 --> 00:11:00,570
So when you finished up that talk over 
there,

230
00:11:00,571 --> 00:11:02,760
did you feel better or worse?
For the course of it?

231
00:11:02,820 --> 00:11:07,290
I felt better and that at least my 
positions were on record.

232
00:11:07,740 --> 00:11:12,740
I didn't have any a sense that the bill 
would be defeated.

233
00:11:13,180 --> 00:11:14,013
I felt very strongly that it would 
ultimately pass just because of the 

234
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:19,530
reality of the dynamics of the political
system there.

235
00:11:19,830 --> 00:11:21,810
But at least I knew that Jordan had been
heard.

236
00:11:21,870 --> 00:11:23,820
I hadn't been heard.
It's officially on record.

237
00:11:24,150 --> 00:11:24,983
Uh,
so in that sense I felt I had done my 

238
00:11:27,210 --> 00:11:28,290
quote,
civic duty,

239
00:11:29,190 --> 00:11:32,040
but I have no illusions that I,
that I would help sway the vote.

240
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:33,960
I knew that we will ultimately lose the 
battle.

241
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:36,360
So when people say,
I'll see online,

242
00:11:36,361 --> 00:11:37,141
sometimes people say,
Oh,

243
00:11:37,141 --> 00:11:41,220
you guys are overestimating when someone
says racist or bigoted or homophobia,

244
00:11:41,230 --> 00:11:42,450
Islamophobia,
any of this stuff.

245
00:11:42,810 --> 00:11:44,880
This really goes to show why these are 
not.

246
00:11:45,090 --> 00:11:47,610
We're not just making up this fight,
this fight,

247
00:11:48,630 --> 00:11:49,463
forget what people are saying online.
This fight is now starting to codify 

248
00:11:52,531 --> 00:11:55,420
things into.
That's absolutely right.

249
00:11:55,421 --> 00:11:56,740
I mean,
but nevermind law.

250
00:11:56,741 --> 00:11:57,491
I mean people say,
well,

251
00:11:57,491 --> 00:11:58,920
you know,
don't take these extreme examples.

252
00:11:58,930 --> 00:12:00,700
Well,
you have Bret Weinstein on this show.

253
00:12:00,970 --> 00:12:01,803
I mean,
is he not a real person who's 

254
00:12:02,620 --> 00:12:03,453
experienced real death threats?
So people always think that we're in in 

255
00:12:07,031 --> 00:12:07,864
a sense engaging in an exaggerated,
exaggerated narrative by pointing to 

256
00:12:11,171 --> 00:12:13,840
these extreme cases.
But what is extreme today,

257
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:14,733
tomorrow becomes mundane.
And so this is why canaries in the coal 

258
00:12:18,671 --> 00:12:21,660
mine stand up and sing and warn people.
Uh,

259
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:24,370
but unfortunately,
apparently people don't want to listen.

260
00:12:24,430 --> 00:12:28,960
Do you ever think that it's Kinda,
it's Kinda sucky to be someone that sees

261
00:12:28,961 --> 00:12:31,460
something a little bit early?
I think it's sometimes like,

262
00:12:31,830 --> 00:12:33,190
it's great at a certain level,
right?

263
00:12:33,190 --> 00:12:34,023
Because that's what makes people care 
about what you're saying because they 

264
00:12:35,891 --> 00:12:37,450
have a,
they have a twinge of,

265
00:12:37,451 --> 00:12:38,740
oh,
that guy's onto something.

266
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:42,340
But like when I sat here with Brett and 
he at the time,

267
00:12:42,341 --> 00:12:44,980
I don't know what he identifies as now,
but the time he was saying I'm a,

268
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:45,670
you know,
uh,

269
00:12:45,670 --> 00:12:46,210
he said,
uh,

270
00:12:46,210 --> 00:12:49,180
deeply I think deeply committed,
progressive,

271
00:12:49,570 --> 00:12:51,490
uh,
I now know that he,

272
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:54,280
at least I don't want to speak for them,
but basically it said,

273
00:12:54,281 --> 00:12:58,600
you know,
the progressive train has left him or he

274
00:12:58,601 --> 00:13:02,320
grew up or perhaps I don't know that he 
would say it so specifically.

275
00:13:02,540 --> 00:13:04,570
But,
but I knew it as I was sitting here with

276
00:13:04,571 --> 00:13:06,940
him and he was saying how he was this,
this deep progressive.

277
00:13:07,210 --> 00:13:08,043
I knew that it was just a matter of a 
month or two months or whatever before 

278
00:13:10,781 --> 00:13:14,110
he'd see the same thing that we've all 
been talking about for that long.

279
00:13:14,110 --> 00:13:18,040
So there's like a joy and also like a 
depression in that I think,

280
00:13:18,310 --> 00:13:21,010
well,
my wife often tells me that I'm an avant

281
00:13:21,011 --> 00:13:24,010
garde both and my scientific career and 
in my public engagements,

282
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:27,700
I think it's in part because I do see 
these trends early,

283
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:30,280
but also because I have the courage to 
speak about them.

284
00:13:30,490 --> 00:13:33,280
You and I both see them at the same 
time,

285
00:13:33,310 --> 00:13:34,143
but if I only have the courage to say it
than I appear as though I'm the avant 

286
00:13:36,581 --> 00:13:37,414
garde guy.
Whereas you saw the same pattern but 

287
00:13:38,561 --> 00:13:39,394
were too afraid to say it.
And so in a sense it's a unique 

288
00:13:41,201 --> 00:13:44,110
combination of both seeing these 
patterns early enough,

289
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:48,100
but then having the courage to voice my 
opinion.

290
00:13:48,340 --> 00:13:49,173
And of course that ultimately and 
academia is not something contrary to 

291
00:13:52,331 --> 00:13:54,580
what you might think is not something 
that's desired.

292
00:13:54,610 --> 00:13:57,910
Herd mentality is really,
as we say in French dirty girl.

293
00:13:57,910 --> 00:14:00,040
It's the.
It's the official way to be.

294
00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:03,280
Don't cause too much waves.
We don't want trouble here.

295
00:14:03,370 --> 00:14:04,203
Right?
Which is so the reverse of what true 

296
00:14:05,441 --> 00:14:08,470
pursuit of knowledge is.
So when people say that,

297
00:14:08,471 --> 00:14:09,400
I'll also hear that,
well,

298
00:14:09,401 --> 00:14:10,234
you're,
you guys are a overblowing what's 

299
00:14:11,441 --> 00:14:12,274
happening on college campuses or your 
overblowing that there isn't enough 

300
00:14:14,231 --> 00:14:17,140
diversity of thought there as someone 
that's on college campuses,

301
00:14:17,141 --> 00:14:17,974
as someone that has testified about 
what's happening there and as someone 

302
00:14:20,291 --> 00:14:23,830
that knows plenty of academics in,
in Canada and the United States,

303
00:14:23,831 --> 00:14:26,320
are we overblowing this?
Absolutely not.

304
00:14:26,530 --> 00:14:27,363
I mean,
when it comes to issues like political 

305
00:14:29,321 --> 00:14:30,520
matters,
uh,

306
00:14:30,550 --> 00:14:33,970
how people make pronouncements about a 
given religion or they or not,

307
00:14:34,410 --> 00:14:37,870
there is APP.
Everybody walks to the exact same beat.

308
00:14:38,230 --> 00:14:39,670
Uh,
again,

309
00:14:39,671 --> 00:14:40,720
I could just use,
for example,

310
00:14:40,721 --> 00:14:43,450
anecdotal evidence or,
or I could cite actual studies,

311
00:14:43,630 --> 00:14:45,280
but let's go with anecdotal evidence.

312
00:14:45,550 --> 00:14:47,440
And I think I might've mentioned this 
before on the show.

313
00:14:47,441 --> 00:14:50,530
If you just go to my personal facebook 
page,

314
00:14:50,770 --> 00:14:51,603
you never see anyone and I've got 
hundreds of academic friends on my 

315
00:14:54,951 --> 00:14:55,784
personal facebook page.
Not a single person has ever uttered 

316
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:00,230
deposition regarding,
say trump,

317
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:01,333
that I would construe as surprising,
surprising in the sense that they might 

318
00:15:03,890 --> 00:15:06,740
say something that is positive of him or
favorable,

319
00:15:06,741 --> 00:15:11,390
or why someone might have voted for him.
Every single academic friend that I have

320
00:15:11,690 --> 00:15:15,350
apes the identical same position.
And that's simply not possible,

321
00:15:15,351 --> 00:15:17,210
right?
Within any group of people,

322
00:15:17,211 --> 00:15:19,370
you would expect some diversity of 
thinking.

323
00:15:19,550 --> 00:15:20,570
Well,
apparently there isn't.

324
00:15:20,790 --> 00:15:22,250
All right,
so let's talk about trump a little bit.

325
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:24,940
Now.
I want to be clear that right now,

326
00:15:24,941 --> 00:15:25,774
as we tape this,
I'm about to go off the grid for a 

327
00:15:27,591 --> 00:15:28,424
month.
So this is going up about 12 or 13 days 

328
00:15:31,100 --> 00:15:32,240
after we're taping this.

329
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:36,140
So in the way that we live these days,
trump could have done anything by then,

330
00:15:36,141 --> 00:15:39,790
the impeachment proceedings could have 
been regarding the monarchy,

331
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:40,633
could've started.
Who the hell knows what's going to 

332
00:15:41,541 --> 00:15:43,700
happen?
But as we tape this on,

333
00:15:43,701 --> 00:15:45,950
what's today?
July 28th,

334
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:47,960
uh,
2017.

335
00:15:48,340 --> 00:15:49,173
Um,
I think you've been basically pretty 

336
00:15:51,501 --> 00:15:55,340
fair on trump.
I don't sense that you love the guy.

337
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:56,193
No,
but I don't sense that you're have a 

338
00:15:57,621 --> 00:16:00,230
deranged hatred of the guy.
Is that a fair estimation?

339
00:16:00,231 --> 00:16:01,430
Again?
That's exactly right.

340
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:05,780
And usually when I've come out in 
support of trump,

341
00:16:06,140 --> 00:16:08,360
that's not usually what I've done.
Instead,

342
00:16:08,361 --> 00:16:09,194
I have offered very a reasonable 
psychological reasons why someone might 

343
00:16:14,811 --> 00:16:16,850
vote for trump.
And so,

344
00:16:17,060 --> 00:16:17,890
uh,
I,

345
00:16:17,890 --> 00:16:18,723
uh,
you may remember this in one of my 

346
00:16:19,910 --> 00:16:20,743
conversations,
I think it was with Sam Harris or I 

347
00:16:22,251 --> 00:16:23,084
explained the actual decision rule that 
someone might use in arriving at a 

348
00:16:27,620 --> 00:16:29,150
decision to vote for trump.

349
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:32,510
And I'll just repeat it for here.
So when you're,

350
00:16:32,540 --> 00:16:34,970
when you're choosing between two multi 
attribute products,

351
00:16:35,030 --> 00:16:39,660
two cars to people to hire two mates to 
marry their,

352
00:16:39,740 --> 00:16:40,573
each defined by many attributes.
So there are many decision rules that I 

353
00:16:42,801 --> 00:16:43,634
could use in deciding whether to choose 
alternative ar alternative be one of 

354
00:16:46,401 --> 00:16:48,620
these decision rules.
It's called the lexical graphic rule,

355
00:16:48,650 --> 00:16:49,483
which basically says,
take your most important attribute to 

356
00:16:52,071 --> 00:16:52,904
you and choose the alternative that 
scores higher on that most important 

357
00:16:56,721 --> 00:16:58,340
attribute.
That's the only thing you look at.

358
00:16:58,760 --> 00:17:01,580
So in the case of applying that rule to 
trump,

359
00:17:01,940 --> 00:17:03,920
if let's say,
my most important attribute,

360
00:17:03,921 --> 00:17:07,400
my lexical graphic rule attribute is 
immigration,

361
00:17:07,940 --> 00:17:08,773
and rightly or wrongly,
I viewed that trump scores better on 

362
00:17:11,751 --> 00:17:13,850
immigration.
And if I use that rule,

363
00:17:14,030 --> 00:17:14,863
I will choose trump.
Even though if I had looked at all of 

364
00:17:17,361 --> 00:17:19,520
the attributes of defining trump and 
Clinton,

365
00:17:19,700 --> 00:17:21,170
I might've ended up choosing Clinton.

366
00:17:21,260 --> 00:17:24,110
So as someone who studies psychology of 
decision making,

367
00:17:24,380 --> 00:17:25,213
there are very,
very clear cognitive processes that we 

368
00:17:27,261 --> 00:17:28,094
could use to explain why a very 
reasonable person might end up choosing 

369
00:17:31,161 --> 00:17:31,971
trump.
Now,

370
00:17:31,971 --> 00:17:35,210
that doesn't mean that I,
as I jokingly say on twitter,

371
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:37,280
that I have posters of trump and my 
bedroom.

372
00:17:37,550 --> 00:17:38,383
It simply means that as someone who is 
this passionate who's studying it from 

373
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:44,330
my Canadian context,
as a behavioral decision theorists,

374
00:17:44,510 --> 00:17:46,880
I could understand why people would vote
for trump.

375
00:17:47,570 --> 00:17:52,020
Just uttering that the amount of hate 
that you get and the amount of,

376
00:17:52,310 --> 00:17:54,690
you know,
ostracizing that happens within academia

377
00:17:54,691 --> 00:17:59,010
because you dare say something that 
seems to support trump.

378
00:17:59,100 --> 00:18:01,500
It means craziness.
How much of that do you think is sort of

379
00:18:01,501 --> 00:18:04,770
the elite Ism of academia?
In other words,

380
00:18:04,771 --> 00:18:05,604
your saying something that's that you're
using your the discipline that you have 

381
00:18:09,090 --> 00:18:12,390
to give this idea of why people may have
voted for trump,

382
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:17,190
so you're separating sort of the the Gad
human part you're saying this is.

383
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:18,113
This is what I think is happening based 
on information that I have versus other 

384
00:18:21,001 --> 00:18:21,834
academics that because they want to go 
to all the parties with the academics 

385
00:18:24,481 --> 00:18:25,314
and all of that stuff,
that trump is sort of the reverse 

386
00:18:28,351 --> 00:18:31,380
academic,
so the idea that they could say anything

387
00:18:31,381 --> 00:18:32,214
nice about the person who's the reverse,
who speaks in such ridiculous speech 

388
00:18:35,641 --> 00:18:39,060
patterns and says so many over the top 
things and tweets like a madman,

389
00:18:39,330 --> 00:18:41,760
that somehow that would all be thrust 
upon them.

390
00:18:41,780 --> 00:18:42,613
Right.
The way that I would frame exactly what 

391
00:18:44,221 --> 00:18:47,550
you said as the elitist,
the academics,

392
00:18:47,551 --> 00:18:49,590
the ivory tower folks,
excuse me.

393
00:18:50,190 --> 00:18:55,190
They viewed trump as a fatal attack on 
their sense of aesthetics.

394
00:18:56,970 --> 00:19:01,530
It's he is an injury to their aesthetic.
The way he speaks,

395
00:19:01,531 --> 00:19:04,320
the way he annunciates,
the way he shakes hands.

396
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:05,513
Everything about him as an affront to 
their hardiness and therefore there's 

397
00:19:10,740 --> 00:19:14,430
this visceral hate of him at an 
aesthetic level.

398
00:19:14,580 --> 00:19:16,740
He's grotesque,
he's an older,

399
00:19:16,830 --> 00:19:17,663
he's a buffoon and I see this,
this position and unstated amongst some 

400
00:19:22,021 --> 00:19:26,760
of our common friends where I typically 
would consider those to be those climate

401
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:30,240
friends to be very sophisticated.
This passion of thinkers,

402
00:19:30,450 --> 00:19:31,283
but they've succumbed to that trap where
they are simply unable to stomach the 

403
00:19:35,161 --> 00:19:38,310
possibility that this person could be 
sitting in the highest office.

404
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:42,750
I think it really is that simple.
They despise his sense of aesthetics.

405
00:19:42,930 --> 00:19:43,763
So I sent that.
Your position on him is sort of where 

406
00:19:47,011 --> 00:19:51,000
mine is in that forgetting what I think 
about him personally and again,

407
00:19:51,001 --> 00:19:53,970
I can say the phrase moral center.
Every time I bring them up again,

408
00:19:54,150 --> 00:19:54,983
don't know what his moral center is.
I'm still confused as whether he's 

409
00:19:57,301 --> 00:19:58,134
waking up everyday and making all the 
decisions as they come on the flight or 

410
00:20:00,871 --> 00:20:02,580
if there's a grand plan or any of that.

411
00:20:02,910 --> 00:20:03,743
But the part that I like is the part 
that the media has taken it on the Chin 

412
00:20:06,811 --> 00:20:07,644
and basically been blown apart and that 
I think is what we needed in this 

413
00:20:10,411 --> 00:20:11,880
country.
Um,

414
00:20:12,030 --> 00:20:13,460
I sent.
You're kind of with me on.

415
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:14,333
Absolutely.
Look to use a cliche that I don't 

416
00:20:15,751 --> 00:20:18,690
particularly like from sort of the 
buzzwords of business.

417
00:20:18,930 --> 00:20:20,430
He is a disruptor,
right?

418
00:20:20,610 --> 00:20:21,443
To the extent that you wanted someone.
It's funny because they all loved 

419
00:20:24,321 --> 00:20:25,410
disrupters,
but now they,

420
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:27,860
every now and again you're going to get 
a disruptor you don't like,

421
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:28,340
right?
I mean,

422
00:20:28,340 --> 00:20:32,280
he's the structure in every possible way
that you could conceive of that term.

423
00:20:32,281 --> 00:20:34,650
Right?
He's from outside the political class.

424
00:20:34,651 --> 00:20:37,920
He's never held political office.
He speaks differently from them.

425
00:20:37,921 --> 00:20:40,140
He's a brawler.
He's a real estate guy.

426
00:20:40,410 --> 00:20:41,040
His,
his,

427
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:41,873
his,
his language pattern is that of a thug 

428
00:20:44,280 --> 00:20:45,600
in grade eight.

429
00:20:46,230 --> 00:20:47,063
He is somewhat buffoonish,
so in every possible way that we could 

430
00:20:49,931 --> 00:20:54,430
think of what they aspire to.
Barack Obama,

431
00:20:54,550 --> 00:20:58,300
he's the Anti Barack Obama.
Barack Obama is sophisticated.

432
00:20:58,301 --> 00:21:00,460
These majestic.
He's a great orator.

433
00:21:00,670 --> 00:21:01,840
Right?
But again,

434
00:21:02,410 --> 00:21:04,030
those are superficial cues,
right?

435
00:21:04,060 --> 00:21:04,891
Typically when we,
when,

436
00:21:04,891 --> 00:21:06,670
when we look at the psychology of 
persuasion,

437
00:21:06,671 --> 00:21:09,190
we look at substantive cues or cosmetic 
use,

438
00:21:09,191 --> 00:21:10,024
right?
How tall you are is something that 

439
00:21:11,621 --> 00:21:13,780
people use when they judge your 
leadership qualities,

440
00:21:13,781 --> 00:21:16,290
but if objectively it shouldn't matter,
right?

441
00:21:16,630 --> 00:21:17,463
And so in a similar manner,
the fact that he might speak in a way 

442
00:21:20,291 --> 00:21:21,124
that is clearly much more buffoonish 
than say Barack Obama doesn't 

443
00:21:24,731 --> 00:21:28,000
necessarily speak to whether you 
appreciate his policies or not.

444
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:28,953
Yeah.
And that's the part that I think is 

445
00:21:29,651 --> 00:21:30,790
interesting because again,
as I said,

446
00:21:30,791 --> 00:21:32,410
we're,
we're taping this about two weeks before

447
00:21:32,411 --> 00:21:33,244
it's going to air.
So who the hell knows what's going to 

448
00:21:35,321 --> 00:21:35,590
happen?

449
00:21:35,590 --> 00:21:37,030
But even just in the last couple of 
days,

450
00:21:37,031 --> 00:21:38,480
there was this thing with,
uh,

451
00:21:38,540 --> 00:21:42,400
with scar moochy and,
or the recording and you know,

452
00:21:42,401 --> 00:21:44,920
bannon wants to suck his own cock and 
blah,

453
00:21:44,921 --> 00:21:45,161
blah,
blah.

454
00:21:45,161 --> 00:21:47,050
All this stuff.
And everyone's freaking out.

455
00:21:47,051 --> 00:21:48,970
I'm looking at twitter and all the 
journalists,

456
00:21:48,971 --> 00:21:49,804
all the lefties,
everyone's freaking out over the 

457
00:21:51,011 --> 00:21:52,570
language and how can they talk like 
this?

458
00:21:53,050 --> 00:21:54,980
And all I was thinking was,
yeah,

459
00:21:55,180 --> 00:21:58,090
I mean I guess in some perfect world 
that we don't exist.

460
00:21:58,091 --> 00:22:01,120
I wish that government officials would 
be a little more professional,

461
00:22:01,270 --> 00:22:05,630
but the idea that Obama people and Bush 
before that and Clinton before that,

462
00:22:05,631 --> 00:22:08,710
and then you can go back forever 
literally go back to George Washington,

463
00:22:08,890 --> 00:22:13,890
the idea that they didn't speak it with 
blue language and say nasty things about

464
00:22:14,291 --> 00:22:15,124
each other and all of that stuff.
And the infighting and back to the idea 

465
00:22:18,131 --> 00:22:21,770
that this has just appeared now is just 
outrageous.

466
00:22:22,120 --> 00:22:24,370
It's just fake.
It's full outrage.

467
00:22:24,371 --> 00:22:25,204
Again,
it's trying to maintain the facade of 

468
00:22:27,371 --> 00:22:28,660
the ivory tower,
right?

469
00:22:28,661 --> 00:22:32,920
This highfalutin way of Bologna.
I mean it wasn't a Nixon who,

470
00:22:32,921 --> 00:22:35,380
when you look at his,
his transcripts,

471
00:22:35,410 --> 00:22:38,560
every second word that a,
yeah,

472
00:22:38,561 --> 00:22:42,190
these guys are not a Oxford professors 
of philosophy.

473
00:22:42,280 --> 00:22:43,930
And by the way,
I wouldn't want them to be.

474
00:22:43,931 --> 00:22:46,750
I want them to be human.
That that's also the irony.

475
00:22:46,751 --> 00:22:48,670
It's like when Bill Clinton said I don't
inhale,

476
00:22:48,671 --> 00:22:49,504
it was like you could admit you inhale 
or when Barack Obama gets did say he 

477
00:22:52,781 --> 00:22:54,490
inhaled,
but it was like the idea that we have to

478
00:22:54,491 --> 00:22:57,400
feel guilty about all of these things.
Like we're all humans,

479
00:22:57,401 --> 00:23:00,580
we curse some of us drink or smoke pot 
or do some other shit.

480
00:23:00,910 --> 00:23:01,743
And just to mention a couple of other 
qualities that I think trump does have 

481
00:23:06,730 --> 00:23:08,020
a.
You know,

482
00:23:08,021 --> 00:23:10,300
when you face a lot of conflicts there,
there's some research,

483
00:23:10,301 --> 00:23:11,350
I don't remember who it's by.

484
00:23:11,350 --> 00:23:13,810
I think it's made by Gregory at Texas 
Tech,

485
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:14,673
if I'm not mistaken.
He looked at what types of leaders do 

486
00:23:17,441 --> 00:23:21,220
people wish to elect as a function of 
the environment.

487
00:23:21,250 --> 00:23:22,750
Is there for example,
war or not,

488
00:23:23,050 --> 00:23:23,883
and so our preference for a particular 
type of leadership style changes as a 

489
00:23:27,011 --> 00:23:29,080
function of the environment as you would
expect.

490
00:23:29,380 --> 00:23:30,213
Well,
to the extent that we now face a lot of 

491
00:23:31,301 --> 00:23:34,270
chaos with terrorism,
with the immigration problems and so on.

492
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:37,720
I would have predicted that someone like
trump,

493
00:23:37,750 --> 00:23:41,740
a guy who appears to be a bit reckless 
of periods to be as though,

494
00:23:41,900 --> 00:23:42,733
am I going to press the Red Button?
Am I not going to press it even though 

495
00:23:45,050 --> 00:23:46,820
he's not going,
but the fact that he,

496
00:23:46,970 --> 00:23:47,803
he exudes those types of signals,
I think to a lot of people that is 

497
00:23:50,781 --> 00:23:51,614
equality because you have very dangerous
guys in the neighborhood who might feel 

498
00:23:55,881 --> 00:23:56,714
intimidated by someone who appears to be
a risk taker who appears to be a 

499
00:23:59,991 --> 00:24:01,280
brawler,
and so in that sense,

500
00:24:01,700 --> 00:24:02,533
here's another psychological reason why 
a lot of people might have latched onto 

501
00:24:04,851 --> 00:24:05,684
him,
so it also goes to show why when Obama 

502
00:24:08,151 --> 00:24:08,984
or Hillary wouldn't say radical Islamic 
terror or whatever phrase that you 

503
00:24:12,141 --> 00:24:15,570
wanted to say,
a and trump would just say anything,

504
00:24:15,571 --> 00:24:17,480
and she said trump was just given them 
the red meat.

505
00:24:17,510 --> 00:24:18,890
They were going,
give me something.

506
00:24:18,920 --> 00:24:21,620
Give me something that makes sense.
Then trump says something.

507
00:24:21,621 --> 00:24:23,840
It's probably over the top,
but they're going,

508
00:24:23,850 --> 00:24:25,910
well,
at least it's something exactly right.

509
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:27,433
I should mention.
I know that we both tentatively agreed 

510
00:24:29,891 --> 00:24:31,690
that talked much about Islam before the 
show,

511
00:24:31,850 --> 00:24:33,260
but let me just mention one or two 
things.

512
00:24:34,010 --> 00:24:34,843
I think it is a misnomer to constantly 
come up with qualifiers before the word 

513
00:24:38,571 --> 00:24:41,930
Islam and let me explain why that is.
There is not Islam,

514
00:24:41,931 --> 00:24:44,900
there is not Islamism Islam,
Islam as part of Islam.

515
00:24:45,380 --> 00:24:46,213
Islam as a set of codifying ideas that 
has a spiritual element and it has a 

516
00:24:50,151 --> 00:24:54,060
political element.
That political element is Islam.

517
00:24:54,061 --> 00:24:54,894
Islam,
the manner in which now people are 

518
00:24:56,121 --> 00:24:57,500
talking about Islam.
Islam is.

519
00:24:57,501 --> 00:24:57,940
It's,
it's,

520
00:24:57,940 --> 00:24:58,773
it's something that is outside of Islam 
and I understand the reason why people 

521
00:25:02,481 --> 00:25:03,080
want to do this.

522
00:25:03,080 --> 00:25:03,913
It's because they feel as though it's 
two Gauche to frontally attacker 

523
00:25:07,280 --> 00:25:08,113
religion,
so if you attack something that has 

524
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:11,970
magically ism at the end of it,
Islam,

525
00:25:11,971 --> 00:25:13,250
Islam,
that's okay.

526
00:25:13,340 --> 00:25:15,320
If you attack Islam,
that's not okay,

527
00:25:15,620 --> 00:25:16,453
but the reality is if we're truly going 
to have a serious and honest 

528
00:25:18,711 --> 00:25:19,544
conversation about this topic,
we have to recognize that it's not 

529
00:25:21,381 --> 00:25:22,970
radical Islam.
It's not Islam Islam.

530
00:25:22,971 --> 00:25:23,804
It's not militant violent extremism and 
and every other permutation of a 

531
00:25:27,861 --> 00:25:30,170
euphemism that you come up with.
It's Islam.

532
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:31,033
Now.
Most people choose to practice a 

533
00:25:33,890 --> 00:25:34,723
cafeteria version of Islam.
They pick the parts that they like and 

534
00:25:37,311 --> 00:25:38,144
they ignore the endless parts that they 
don't like and that becomes their 

535
00:25:41,031 --> 00:25:43,850
personal relationship with Islam.
That doesn't end that,

536
00:25:43,851 --> 00:25:45,470
but most people do that with most 
religions.

537
00:25:45,560 --> 00:25:46,810
Most people do that with most 
relationships.

538
00:25:47,250 --> 00:25:50,950
You and I and everybody else don't stay 
up worrying about seventh day adventist,

539
00:25:50,951 --> 00:25:51,784
so,
so the extent that Islam is now on the 

540
00:25:54,351 --> 00:25:56,210
radar and we have to talk about it 
honestly,

541
00:25:56,720 --> 00:26:00,530
we have to stop trying to give a free 
pass to Islam,

542
00:26:00,770 --> 00:26:02,450
but the real problem is something else.

543
00:26:02,450 --> 00:26:06,770
Some variant of it.
Islam is codified in the Koran.

544
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:09,200
It's called the fight in the Heidi's 
score of filing the Sierra,

545
00:26:09,470 --> 00:26:11,540
the biography of Muhammad.
That's it.

546
00:26:11,780 --> 00:26:12,613
Now,
is there a way that I could read those 

547
00:26:14,091 --> 00:26:17,960
techs and come up with a message of 
brotherly love and love for Jews?

548
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:19,810
No,
that's not Islam.

549
00:26:19,811 --> 00:26:22,340
Islam,
radical Islam that Islam.

550
00:26:22,670 --> 00:26:24,170
Now,
as I say this,

551
00:26:24,260 --> 00:26:29,260
I also recognize that 95 percent of all 
Muslims are just as nice as anybody that

552
00:26:30,921 --> 00:26:31,754
you could hope to have.
That's not because they practice a 

553
00:26:33,801 --> 00:26:37,220
gentle version of Islam,
codified in some other set of tax.

554
00:26:37,430 --> 00:26:38,263
That's because they're decent human 
beings will decide to like the rest of 

555
00:26:41,031 --> 00:26:43,920
us pick and choose which parts apply to 
their daily lives and not.

556
00:26:44,210 --> 00:26:46,200
So we have to be very careful and honest
about.

557
00:26:46,430 --> 00:26:47,263
And I hope that at some point soon a 
greater number of our common friends 

558
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:54,870
will actually hear what I'm saying now,
by the way,

559
00:26:54,871 --> 00:26:55,704
for the record,
because you just mentioned that we said 

560
00:26:56,731 --> 00:26:58,110
we were going to talk about that much 
about Islam.

561
00:26:58,110 --> 00:26:59,980
It's not because we're afraid.
I think we both,

562
00:27:00,180 --> 00:27:01,013
we both talked about it down,
but we realized that we wanted to get 

563
00:27:02,521 --> 00:27:04,570
more into some science stuff and plenty 
of other stuff.

564
00:27:04,571 --> 00:27:05,404
So I just want,
I just want to be clear because 

565
00:27:05,941 --> 00:27:07,520
otherwise people are combined and they 
just see they're,

566
00:27:07,590 --> 00:27:09,440
they're afraid now.
Um,

567
00:27:09,700 --> 00:27:11,400
all right.
So very quickly on that though.

568
00:27:11,401 --> 00:27:13,570
So you are writing a new book right now,
which,

569
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:17,500
which deals with this and deals with 
ostrich parasitic syndrome.

570
00:27:17,590 --> 00:27:18,423
Yes.
So very quickly for those that don't 

571
00:27:20,221 --> 00:27:22,140
know what o p,
s is,

572
00:27:22,141 --> 00:27:24,250
let's talk about that and then I won't 
talk about the book and then we'll move.

573
00:27:24,300 --> 00:27:24,841
Sure,
sure.

574
00:27:24,841 --> 00:27:25,680
Thanks.
Thanks for asking.

575
00:27:26,100 --> 00:27:29,850
So let me sort of step back and give 
some some analogies.

576
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:30,833
So if you look in the animal kingdom,
there are many cases where you have 

577
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:34,073
brain worms or pathogens that enter the 
brain of a particular species and it 

578
00:27:38,971 --> 00:27:41,490
renders that species zombified.

579
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:43,020
Okay?
So example,

580
00:27:43,290 --> 00:27:44,123
a,
a mouse can be infected by a particular 

581
00:27:45,900 --> 00:27:50,010
pathogen.
It loses its innate fear of cats.

582
00:27:50,070 --> 00:27:50,903
That's not a good thing if you're a mom,
there's another type of brain warm that 

583
00:27:54,360 --> 00:27:57,660
attacks the brains of ungulates,
let's say moose or elk or deer,

584
00:27:57,990 --> 00:27:58,823
and they become,
they become completely zombified where 

585
00:28:00,631 --> 00:28:01,464
they just circle and the same in the 
same spot until these looming predators 

586
00:28:04,501 --> 00:28:05,620
come and eat them.
Right?

587
00:28:06,300 --> 00:28:10,260
Think of another example of someone who 
suffers from Anorexia nervosa.

588
00:28:10,560 --> 00:28:11,393
Right there they're thinking now has 
become so disordered that even though 

589
00:28:13,711 --> 00:28:14,544
they only weigh 70 pounds,
they look at themselves in the mirror 

590
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:18,113
and they genuinely think that there are.
They remain grotesquely obese and they 

591
00:28:20,641 --> 00:28:21,900
need to lose a bit more weight.
Right?

592
00:28:22,110 --> 00:28:22,943
So there are all sorts of ways.
There are all sorts of analogies where 

593
00:28:26,520 --> 00:28:27,353
whether it be in the human context or 
with other species where our brain 

594
00:28:30,751 --> 00:28:35,100
become hijacked by either disordered 
thinking or literally a pathogen.

595
00:28:35,340 --> 00:28:36,173
So I took these ideas and I argued,
well what could explain the collective 

596
00:28:38,731 --> 00:28:39,564
psychosis,
the collective departure from reason 

597
00:28:41,940 --> 00:28:42,773
that we see being exhibited in the west,
not only as related to Islam but as 

598
00:28:48,391 --> 00:28:49,290
relating,
for example,

599
00:28:49,291 --> 00:28:52,800
to the negation of the idea that humans 
are biological beings,

600
00:28:53,010 --> 00:28:54,560
that there are sex differences that they
are.

601
00:28:54,900 --> 00:28:58,860
So this ostrich person x syndrome is not
only applicable to Islam,

602
00:28:59,160 --> 00:29:01,900
and so that's how I came up with that 
term to to,

603
00:29:02,160 --> 00:29:02,993
to use the metaphor of the Australia 
buries his head even though it doesn't 

604
00:29:06,330 --> 00:29:07,163
really do that,
but it's an apt metaphor of the denial 

605
00:29:09,181 --> 00:29:10,920
of reliance,
reality,

606
00:29:11,310 --> 00:29:13,760
parasitic in that a genuinely 
progressive sizes,

607
00:29:13,780 --> 00:29:16,140
your brain and you lose your ability to 
think.

608
00:29:16,440 --> 00:29:17,273
Now I specifically apply it to Islam 
because typically the ostriches that 

609
00:29:21,841 --> 00:29:22,674
succumb to ops got engage in all sorts 
of cognitive distortions to protect 

610
00:29:26,791 --> 00:29:27,624
Islam,
which ironically you're talking about 

611
00:29:29,311 --> 00:29:31,200
people that are not Muslim for the most 
part,

612
00:29:31,500 --> 00:29:31,890
right?

613
00:29:31,890 --> 00:29:32,850
Absolutely.
So,

614
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:33,713
so,
so many of the ops suffers will end up 

615
00:29:35,671 --> 00:29:39,180
being non Muslims who because they've 
been pressurized by ops,

616
00:29:39,300 --> 00:29:42,640
will come up with all sorts of 
disordered thinking to defend Islam.

617
00:29:42,641 --> 00:29:44,080
Right?
And I give many,

618
00:29:44,081 --> 00:29:49,081
many such examples.
Now I take this idea and it's part of my

619
00:29:49,211 --> 00:29:50,044
book.
So the book is tentatively titled Death 

620
00:29:52,300 --> 00:29:55,610
Of the West by a thousand cuts.
This is the idea that we,

621
00:29:55,660 --> 00:30:00,660
we are currently facing this opioid 
epidemic because of a perfect confluence

622
00:30:03,160 --> 00:30:07,000
of full intellectual movements that have
porosities our brains,

623
00:30:07,270 --> 00:30:10,060
so it's not one thing.
It's radical feminism,

624
00:30:10,061 --> 00:30:13,090
it's identity politics,
it's cultural and moral relativism.

625
00:30:13,240 --> 00:30:14,073
It's postmodernism,
each of which uses its own machinery to 

626
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:22,960
personalize our brain to move away from 
reason,

627
00:30:23,080 --> 00:30:23,913
right?
I reject the idea that there's male and 

628
00:30:25,481 --> 00:30:26,320
female.
Well,

629
00:30:26,321 --> 00:30:28,630
evolutionary biologists and evolutionary
psychologists don't.

630
00:30:28,690 --> 00:30:29,523
Right?
I reject that they are an eight sex 

631
00:30:30,761 --> 00:30:31,300
differences.

632
00:30:31,300 --> 00:30:33,550
While the average three year old knows 
that there is such a thing,

633
00:30:33,820 --> 00:30:37,330
I reject that there's any link between 
Islam and any terrorism.

634
00:30:37,480 --> 00:30:38,920
Islam is peace,
right?

635
00:30:39,010 --> 00:30:42,240
So how did we lead to this?
What we we lead with?

636
00:30:42,270 --> 00:30:43,103
We were led to this by 40,
50 years of these movements chipping 

637
00:30:47,711 --> 00:30:48,544
away at our commitment to reason and 
hence death of the West by a thousand 

638
00:30:52,931 --> 00:30:53,764
cuts.
So what was the failure of the side of 

639
00:30:55,631 --> 00:31:00,250
reason then for the last 40 or 50 years?
What did the people that were reasonable

640
00:31:00,251 --> 00:31:01,084
that were sensible and trying to deal 
with things honestly and see the world 

641
00:31:03,641 --> 00:31:05,500
as it is,
not how they wanted it to be,

642
00:31:05,710 --> 00:31:06,760
where,
where did they fail?

643
00:31:06,790 --> 00:31:07,180
Well,
I,

644
00:31:07,180 --> 00:31:10,510
so if I say,
if I speak in the academic ecosystem,

645
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:13,810
I think the fact that we tolerated 
these,

646
00:31:14,740 --> 00:31:19,740
these affront to human decency and human
reason like postmodernism to exist,

647
00:31:20,470 --> 00:31:22,500
it really came from a place of,
you know,

648
00:31:22,540 --> 00:31:25,360
we have to tolerate,
in this case the intolerable,

649
00:31:25,540 --> 00:31:26,373
intolerable,
and that nothing could be further from 

650
00:31:29,291 --> 00:31:31,450
being anti scientific than 
postmodernism.

651
00:31:31,740 --> 00:31:32,573
Postmodernism say there are no objective
truths other than of course the one 

652
00:31:36,191 --> 00:31:37,024
truth that there are the,
you really got to be exactly so 

653
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:43,430
postmodernism and all of its endless 
footprints,

654
00:31:43,630 --> 00:31:44,630
profundity and,
and,

655
00:31:44,660 --> 00:31:45,493
and you know,
full nonsense is really a direct attack 

656
00:31:49,540 --> 00:31:50,590
on science.
Right?

657
00:31:50,740 --> 00:31:51,573
Science presumes that there are certain 
universal regularities that we're going 

658
00:31:55,421 --> 00:31:58,060
to use the scientific method to try to 
better understand.

659
00:31:58,270 --> 00:32:01,480
Well,
imagine if now a bunch of nihilists come

660
00:32:01,481 --> 00:32:03,490
along who say there is no such thing as 
true.

661
00:32:03,670 --> 00:32:05,800
There is no such thing as objective 
truth.

662
00:32:06,520 --> 00:32:09,610
Well,
that chips away at the reason why we all

663
00:32:09,611 --> 00:32:11,800
exist in science to try to understand 
the world,

664
00:32:11,830 --> 00:32:15,310
but how would academia academia fight 
that properly?

665
00:32:15,311 --> 00:32:17,810
If the idea is we have to battle,
you know,

666
00:32:17,980 --> 00:32:19,960
I know we both believe in the battle of 
ideas.

667
00:32:19,961 --> 00:32:20,650
So if the,
uh,

668
00:32:20,650 --> 00:32:24,880
if the idea here is that in colleges 
you're supposed to have these battles.

669
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:28,170
I know you beat it with better ideas,
but how,

670
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:29,860
how would that have actually happened?
Well,

671
00:32:29,861 --> 00:32:31,870
I think what probably ended up 
happening,

672
00:32:32,140 --> 00:32:32,950
I mean,
I'm,

673
00:32:32,950 --> 00:32:36,550
I'm surmising here,
I'm not sure how it happened,

674
00:32:36,551 --> 00:32:40,430
but I'm guessing that most people are in
their daily lives,

675
00:32:40,431 --> 00:32:41,264
right?
That for the same reasons why most 

676
00:32:42,111 --> 00:32:44,140
people don't speak out against Islam.
But you know,

677
00:32:44,210 --> 00:32:47,550
let Dave Rubin worry about that,
that let someone else were thrilled.

678
00:32:48,420 --> 00:32:49,253
You know,
I'm busy preparing for my daughter's 

679
00:32:51,231 --> 00:32:52,064
graduation.
I got to pick up the tomatoes for my 

680
00:32:53,601 --> 00:32:54,590
groceries today.
Right?

681
00:32:54,770 --> 00:32:57,290
And so people diffused responsibility to
others.

682
00:32:57,291 --> 00:32:58,124
So in a sense,
there is a split within academia from 

683
00:33:00,261 --> 00:33:03,410
the sciences,
the natural and social sciences.

684
00:33:03,411 --> 00:33:04,244
By the way,
it is wrong to presume that the social 

685
00:33:06,051 --> 00:33:06,884
sciences are any less committed to the 
scientific method in the natural 

686
00:33:09,411 --> 00:33:10,340
sciences,
which is up to that.

687
00:33:10,340 --> 00:33:11,690
We could do that.
I do want to get to that.

688
00:33:11,691 --> 00:33:13,730
After that,
people are busy,

689
00:33:13,790 --> 00:33:14,623
right?
So the chemists sits in his lab and he 

690
00:33:16,191 --> 00:33:19,320
sees that there's a bunch of humanities 
guys authoring utter,

691
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:21,560
you know,
Jibberish,

692
00:33:21,590 --> 00:33:22,570
right?
Well he's.

693
00:33:22,930 --> 00:33:23,763
He doesn't necessarily have the time and
energy and proclivity to weigh in on it 

694
00:33:27,620 --> 00:33:28,453
and so somehow these guys found a little
niche within the ecosystem called 

695
00:33:31,941 --> 00:33:32,774
academia and they flourished and they 
multiplied and the cancer spread and 

696
00:33:36,020 --> 00:33:38,630
metastasize and now 40,
50 years later,

697
00:33:38,780 --> 00:33:39,613
you have generations of students who 
have spent hundreds of thousands of 

698
00:33:41,811 --> 00:33:45,590
dollars being trained to be naturally 
lobotomized morons.

699
00:33:45,620 --> 00:33:46,453
Yeah.
So the metaphor is perfect of this 

700
00:33:48,441 --> 00:33:50,840
parasite that gets in there and keeps 
multiplying.

701
00:33:51,050 --> 00:33:54,680
And I can picture now the biology 
professor going,

702
00:33:54,740 --> 00:33:55,820
alright,
I kind of see that,

703
00:33:55,821 --> 00:33:56,654
but it's not going to affect me here 
except now what we're seeing is it's 

704
00:33:59,211 --> 00:34:01,010
starting to even creep into that.

705
00:34:01,130 --> 00:34:02,710
Have you seen this?
The business,

706
00:34:02,750 --> 00:34:04,850
great picture online of a,
you know,

707
00:34:05,210 --> 00:34:09,200
somebody selling the shirt and it says 
there are no genders or you can only buy

708
00:34:09,201 --> 00:34:11,220
it in male or female.
And it's like,

709
00:34:11,560 --> 00:34:12,320
there you go.
Alright,

710
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:16,850
so let's talk about the natural sciences
versus the social sciences first for the

711
00:34:16,851 --> 00:34:18,410
layman,
what is the difference?

712
00:34:18,590 --> 00:34:20,120
They both have science in the Gad come 
on,

713
00:34:20,990 --> 00:34:23,260
right?
So the lay,

714
00:34:23,300 --> 00:34:24,133
the lay person will often use these sort
of simplifying your risks sticks to 

715
00:34:27,621 --> 00:34:31,610
determine what is science versus not if 
you're wearing a lab coat,

716
00:34:31,850 --> 00:34:32,683
if you have,
if you have a couple of chemical 

717
00:34:35,241 --> 00:34:39,860
formulas that science because to the 
average lay person that's impenetrable.

718
00:34:40,170 --> 00:34:41,570
Uh,
on the other hand,

719
00:34:41,571 --> 00:34:42,670
most people have,
for example,

720
00:34:42,671 --> 00:34:43,504
of folk psychology,
they have an innate sense of what 

721
00:34:44,931 --> 00:34:45,764
psychology is and therefore to the 
extent that they feel that they can 

722
00:34:48,140 --> 00:34:50,420
contribute,
even though they might be laypeople,

723
00:34:50,540 --> 00:34:52,580
somehow that's less impenetrable to 
them.

724
00:34:52,850 --> 00:34:57,470
So they then will create this false 
dichotomy where chemistry and physics,

725
00:34:57,650 --> 00:35:00,080
that's real science,
but sociology,

726
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:02,210
you know,
it's for people who couldn't hack it in,

727
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:03,170
in,
in physics.

728
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:04,273
The reality is that the only difference 
is what are the phenomena that you're 

729
00:35:07,851 --> 00:35:08,684
studying across these two general 
rubrics of science and the social 

730
00:35:12,831 --> 00:35:14,780
sciences.
You're studying psychology,

731
00:35:14,781 --> 00:35:16,910
anthropology,
economics,

732
00:35:16,970 --> 00:35:17,803
sociology.
It could be as rigorous as the natural 

733
00:35:21,171 --> 00:35:22,970
sciences.
So let me give you an example.

734
00:35:23,210 --> 00:35:24,710
If you could,
if you're a sociologist,

735
00:35:24,711 --> 00:35:27,400
you could study sociometric,
which is you know,

736
00:35:27,410 --> 00:35:30,740
for example,
how this power diffused within a network

737
00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:34,820
and you could use very fancy mathematics
graph theory to try to understand this.

738
00:35:34,821 --> 00:35:35,654
So the type of mathematical modeling 
that you would use to study how power 

739
00:35:38,431 --> 00:35:43,431
diffusers with a network is actually a 
very fancy mathematical approach,

740
00:35:44,070 --> 00:35:48,450
but sociology has somehow been co opted 
by the activists,

741
00:35:48,451 --> 00:35:48,900
right?

742
00:35:48,900 --> 00:35:51,630
So we then view it as being less 
scientific,

743
00:35:51,900 --> 00:35:56,900
but science is simply means adhering 
truthfully to the scientific method.

744
00:35:57,840 --> 00:36:01,410
I posit a hypothesis.
I think about the data that I would need

745
00:36:01,411 --> 00:36:04,950
to collect that would either falsify or 
not the hypothesis.

746
00:36:05,070 --> 00:36:05,903
I collect that data.
I apply some sort of statistical 

747
00:36:08,761 --> 00:36:09,594
analysis and mathematical analysis to 
analyze the data and then I go one way 

748
00:36:13,021 --> 00:36:15,510
or the other.
That could be just as applied.

749
00:36:15,750 --> 00:36:18,000
If it's an economics or if it is in 
physics,

750
00:36:18,210 --> 00:36:19,043
so it is wrong because I often get 
letters and emails from people asking 

751
00:36:22,081 --> 00:36:24,340
me,
well as psychology really escience,

752
00:36:24,630 --> 00:36:25,463
and then of course it's the science.
Ultimately what is more laudable than 

753
00:36:28,711 --> 00:36:32,400
studying the most important organism 
that we know called humans.

754
00:36:32,401 --> 00:36:33,340
Right?
So,

755
00:36:33,380 --> 00:36:38,380
so it's not as though by the sheer 
nature of what physicists study,

756
00:36:38,820 --> 00:36:41,340
they are real scientists,
but the sociologist is not.

757
00:36:41,350 --> 00:36:42,183
And by the way,
I'm not trying to defend sociologist 

758
00:36:43,321 --> 00:36:45,630
here because I often am the one who's 
criticizing.

759
00:36:46,580 --> 00:36:51,000
Usually I'm criticizing them for 
deviating from the scientific method.

760
00:36:51,210 --> 00:36:52,043
What makes them less scientists is that 
they become activists and not 

761
00:36:55,231 --> 00:36:56,064
scientists,
but you could be just as much as a 

762
00:36:57,691 --> 00:36:58,524
scientist if you study something in 
business or if you study something in 

763
00:37:01,291 --> 00:37:02,070
chemistry.
Yeah.

764
00:37:02,070 --> 00:37:04,970
It's interesting that you say talk about
activists,

765
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:05,873
not scientists,
because that's what I've been saying 

766
00:37:06,901 --> 00:37:07,734
about journalists.
These people are not doing true 

767
00:37:10,381 --> 00:37:11,760
journalism,
in fact,

768
00:37:11,761 --> 00:37:14,940
finding anymore and reporting nice and 
based on evidence.

769
00:37:14,941 --> 00:37:15,774
What they're doing is letting their own 
biases slam right into the middle of 

770
00:37:19,860 --> 00:37:21,150
that thing.
And so for,

771
00:37:21,240 --> 00:37:24,390
so one of the things that,
uh,

772
00:37:24,840 --> 00:37:25,673
I will say differentiates the science,
the natural sciences from the social 

773
00:37:28,141 --> 00:37:30,420
sciences,
and that's very much at the heart of the

774
00:37:30,421 --> 00:37:31,254
work that I do.

775
00:37:31,590 --> 00:37:35,280
The natural sciences have organized 
trees of knowledge.

776
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:36,353
So in physics,
people agree on a set of core knowledge 

777
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:42,870
that at this point has become 
unassailable,

778
00:37:43,170 --> 00:37:44,003
not withstanding the fact that they 
still have the epistemic humility to 

779
00:37:46,171 --> 00:37:46,831
say,
Oh,

780
00:37:46,831 --> 00:37:48,630
if new provision,
it's only provisional,

781
00:37:48,631 --> 00:37:51,180
if something now falsifies it,
I'm willing to revise it,

782
00:37:51,960 --> 00:37:54,270
but the bedrock,
the bedrock is there.

783
00:37:54,271 --> 00:37:57,360
There's core knowledge that is now 
unassailable.

784
00:37:57,361 --> 00:37:58,194
And physics and chemistry.
There aren't chemists who are for the 

785
00:38:01,501 --> 00:38:04,320
periodic table against it,
right?

786
00:38:04,860 --> 00:38:05,693
Therefore,
you could build coherent trees of 

787
00:38:07,591 --> 00:38:09,900
knowledge or the term that I love to 
use,

788
00:38:09,901 --> 00:38:13,500
which was reintroduced into the common 
lexicon by Eo Wilson,

789
00:38:13,860 --> 00:38:17,850
the evolutionary biologist at Harvard.
It's consilience unity of knowledge.

790
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:18,833
So the natural sciences by the,
by the nature of how they test theories 

791
00:38:23,250 --> 00:38:24,083
have these organized trees of knowledge.
That's what's lacking in the social 

792
00:38:27,691 --> 00:38:29,040
sciences.
And the reason it's lacking,

793
00:38:29,220 --> 00:38:31,710
it's not because of the social sciences 
are any less scientific,

794
00:38:31,890 --> 00:38:36,890
it's because it is easier for ideologies
to creep into the social sciences.

795
00:38:37,060 --> 00:38:39,820
Right?
So if I'm a libertarian or a Marxist,

796
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:45,000
I might study economics in a way that is
very polluted by my personal ideology.

797
00:38:46,420 --> 00:38:51,370
So it's not that the social sciences are
epistemologically and he inherently less

798
00:38:51,371 --> 00:38:56,371
scientific than chemistry.
It's that biases are easier to creep in.

799
00:38:57,190 --> 00:38:58,960
It's funny because I'll hear and I 
talked to.

800
00:38:58,961 --> 00:39:02,590
Sometimes someone's a leftist economist 
or libertarian economists or whatever it

801
00:39:02,591 --> 00:39:03,910
is.
I'd always think it's kind of funny,

802
00:39:03,911 --> 00:39:06,430
like we all have our own beliefs 
economically.

803
00:39:06,431 --> 00:39:08,440
I'm a little more libertarian these 
days,

804
00:39:08,740 --> 00:39:12,910
but if you're studying something within 
the window of the way you want it to be,

805
00:39:13,130 --> 00:39:15,580
it's by default is going to be a little 
screwy.

806
00:39:15,820 --> 00:39:17,650
Absolutely.
And as I said,

807
00:39:17,850 --> 00:39:22,850
it is naturally more difficult for your 
personal ideological biases to come into

808
00:39:23,970 --> 00:39:26,320
a something that you're studying in 
organic chemistry.

809
00:39:26,470 --> 00:39:27,303
Although I should mention that there 
have been famous cases where even hard 

810
00:39:30,671 --> 00:39:34,120
sciences have been deeply polluted by 
ideology.

811
00:39:34,120 --> 00:39:39,120
So Lysenko Ism Lysenko was a Russian 
Soviet Union,

812
00:39:39,910 --> 00:39:40,743
uh,
geneticists who proposed a theory of 

813
00:39:44,021 --> 00:39:49,021
genetics that he thought was more inline
with Marxist philosophy that was a wrong

814
00:39:51,161 --> 00:39:51,994
theory of genetics that led to a massive
famine and to the death of millions of 

815
00:39:56,981 --> 00:39:57,814
people.
So even it's not as though hard 

816
00:39:59,831 --> 00:40:04,831
scientists are a inoculated from the 
possibility of being progressive advised

817
00:40:05,010 --> 00:40:05,843
by some of these ideological biases.
Do you think it's too late for the hard 

818
00:40:08,201 --> 00:40:09,034
sciences to be protected?
Like is it too late for them to turn 

819
00:40:11,651 --> 00:40:12,484
their forcefield on?
Because we do see this creeping now in 

820
00:40:14,021 --> 00:40:14,854
biology.
I mean Bret Weinstein's been talking 

821
00:40:15,761 --> 00:40:16,594
about this now that now it's really 
reaching its hand into that which could 

822
00:40:19,961 --> 00:40:22,140
have horrific repercussions for.
Well listen,

823
00:40:22,180 --> 00:40:22,930
when,
when a,

824
00:40:22,930 --> 00:40:26,260
when a scientist and the 21st century 
I'm speaking of myself right now,

825
00:40:26,261 --> 00:40:27,094
it has to appear in front of the 
Canadian Senate to argue that there is 

826
00:40:29,141 --> 00:40:30,670
such a thing as male and female.

827
00:40:30,950 --> 00:40:31,783
That evolutionary biology is based on 
the recognition that there is sexual 

828
00:40:34,931 --> 00:40:35,764
dimorphism in human sexual dimorphism is
a fancy term for saying basically that 

829
00:40:39,071 --> 00:40:42,220
they are evolved sex differences.
Humans,

830
00:40:42,490 --> 00:40:45,310
men,
bales are bigger than females,

831
00:40:45,340 --> 00:40:47,170
right?
That's a sexual dimorphism.

832
00:40:47,380 --> 00:40:50,980
So the fact that I have to appear in 
front of the Canadian Senate to actually

833
00:40:50,981 --> 00:40:55,981
argue these things demonstrates how far 
the snake has gone into the den.

834
00:40:56,110 --> 00:40:57,160
Yeah.
So in a weird way,

835
00:40:57,161 --> 00:41:01,720
your position as a evolutionary 
biologist is a,

836
00:41:01,721 --> 00:41:02,554
is sort of right at the front of the 
type of person that this ideology would 

837
00:41:05,651 --> 00:41:06,280
attack,
right?

838
00:41:06,280 --> 00:41:08,190
Just to grab.
I'm an evolutionary psychologists.

839
00:41:08,210 --> 00:41:11,000
Psychologists are not biologists,
biologists,

840
00:41:11,010 --> 00:41:13,630
I,
although I apply evolutionary biological

841
00:41:13,631 --> 00:41:14,430
principles.
Sorry.

842
00:41:14,430 --> 00:41:15,131
Uh,
yeah.

843
00:41:15,131 --> 00:41:15,441
It's,
I mean,

844
00:41:15,441 --> 00:41:16,390
it's,
it's craziness,

845
00:41:16,391 --> 00:41:16,711
right?
And,

846
00:41:16,711 --> 00:41:19,650
and,
and the reason why I'm so if you like,

847
00:41:19,690 --> 00:41:20,523
aware of the epistemological dichotomy 
between the natural and social sciences 

848
00:41:24,190 --> 00:41:25,023
is because my scientific career of 20 
plus years has really been straddling 

849
00:41:28,780 --> 00:41:29,800
both these fields,
right?

850
00:41:30,070 --> 00:41:34,220
I apply evolutionary biology to study 
consumer behavior.

851
00:41:34,370 --> 00:41:37,790
Consumer behavior would be construed as 
something within the social sciences.

852
00:41:37,970 --> 00:41:40,760
Evolutionary biology is something that 
is within the natural sciences,

853
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:41,713
so I really am very much steeped in both
cultures and I see the extent to which 

854
00:41:47,901 --> 00:41:48,734
it is easier for people to succumb to 
their personal biases and the social 

855
00:41:51,801 --> 00:41:53,480
sciences.
Let me just give you one example.

856
00:41:54,680 --> 00:41:59,270
If you start off with the premise that 
you can't agree on whether there is such

857
00:41:59,271 --> 00:42:01,610
a thing as an eight sex differences or 
not,

858
00:42:01,850 --> 00:42:02,683
how could you from that starting point,
ever build a tree of knowledge that's 

859
00:42:06,081 --> 00:42:08,630
organized?
If at this most fundamental level,

860
00:42:08,631 --> 00:42:11,120
we can agree that there is such a thing 
as male or female,

861
00:42:11,420 --> 00:42:12,500
then we're done.
We're cooked.

862
00:42:12,810 --> 00:42:13,643
A physicists don't suffer from that 
problem and that's why they make much 

863
00:42:16,371 --> 00:42:19,010
better progress than than social 
scientists do.

864
00:42:19,190 --> 00:42:22,640
So as someone that studies marketing and
why we behave,

865
00:42:22,940 --> 00:42:25,730
how we do what turns us on,
what turns us off,

866
00:42:25,731 --> 00:42:27,320
all of that.
In a weird way,

867
00:42:27,321 --> 00:42:28,154
you were.
You were prepared for everything that 

868
00:42:29,331 --> 00:42:33,410
was going to happen politically right 
now and what's happening on the academic

869
00:42:33,411 --> 00:42:36,740
front because all of these things,
they're all marketing in a way.

870
00:42:36,741 --> 00:42:38,000
Trump,
it's marketing.

871
00:42:38,001 --> 00:42:39,780
Hillary.
Market yourself in a,

872
00:42:39,970 --> 00:42:40,803
in a certain way.
So the trends were all their life that 

873
00:42:43,531 --> 00:42:44,560
has marketing.
Yeah.

874
00:42:44,780 --> 00:42:46,270
So when people asked me,
so what,

875
00:42:46,271 --> 00:42:48,650
what do you study as,
as a professor of marketing,

876
00:42:48,651 --> 00:42:52,070
and I always answered them.
Everything you do in life is marketing.

877
00:42:52,310 --> 00:42:54,800
You market yourself on the mating 
market.

878
00:42:54,801 --> 00:42:57,420
We even use the euphemisms of the 
marketplace,

879
00:42:57,440 --> 00:42:58,170
right?
You know,

880
00:42:58,170 --> 00:43:00,440
you position yourself in the 
marketplace,

881
00:43:00,620 --> 00:43:02,780
you market yourself and the labor 
market.

882
00:43:03,020 --> 00:43:03,853
You market yourself to friends,
you position yourself depending on 

883
00:43:07,161 --> 00:43:09,230
whether you wish to belong to a group or
not.

884
00:43:09,890 --> 00:43:11,840
Animals communicate with each other,
right?

885
00:43:11,841 --> 00:43:13,610
When,
when animals advertise,

886
00:43:13,611 --> 00:43:14,630
for example,
when the peacock,

887
00:43:15,110 --> 00:43:18,860
the peacock is literally engaging and 
conspicuous advertising.

888
00:43:19,130 --> 00:43:19,963
So everything in life as marketing.
So one of the reasons why I was very 

889
00:43:23,391 --> 00:43:24,224
much interested in applying all of my 
training in marketing is because that's 

890
00:43:28,341 --> 00:43:30,260
I think where all the sexy stuff is,
right?

891
00:43:30,380 --> 00:43:32,540
We take all of these principles from 
psychology,

892
00:43:32,541 --> 00:43:34,130
from economics,
from biology,

893
00:43:34,350 --> 00:43:35,183
uh,
and then I apply them in areas that are 

894
00:43:37,161 --> 00:43:37,994
of greatest import to most people.
Is there something kind of scary about 

895
00:43:40,491 --> 00:43:41,324
that though?
That it's not that the best ideas will 

896
00:43:43,401 --> 00:43:44,234
necessarily when it's that the best 
marketed ideas or win and those often 

897
00:43:47,241 --> 00:43:50,030
are not the same thing.
Very good point.

898
00:43:50,031 --> 00:43:50,480
Listen,
I'm,

899
00:43:50,480 --> 00:43:54,140
I'm right now working on my next book 
and I just connected with a,

900
00:43:54,460 --> 00:43:55,293
a what appears to be a wonderful that's 
very agent and he actually made this 

901
00:43:58,611 --> 00:43:59,180
exact point.

902
00:43:59,180 --> 00:43:59,750
He said,
look,

903
00:43:59,750 --> 00:44:00,583
what's really important as we move 
forward with your book is how to market 

904
00:44:03,351 --> 00:44:04,184
it because there'll be people who will 
be very resistant to the ideas that you 

905
00:44:08,331 --> 00:44:09,980
propose in that book.
So again,

906
00:44:10,130 --> 00:44:12,870
everything is marketing.
So basically if you want to.

907
00:44:13,280 --> 00:44:14,113
So did trump,
do you think have not to bring 

908
00:44:15,021 --> 00:44:16,730
everything back then,
but he must've had,

909
00:44:16,760 --> 00:44:17,593
I guess as a businessman and putting his
name all over these things for the last 

910
00:44:20,721 --> 00:44:21,554
30 years.
He had an innate understanding of 

911
00:44:23,361 --> 00:44:25,760
exactly what you're talking about and 
absolutely.

912
00:44:25,820 --> 00:44:26,653
Well listen,
I could speak to one thing that he knew 

913
00:44:28,521 --> 00:44:29,354
very well.
He could completely read that many 

914
00:44:31,801 --> 00:44:32,634
people,
the silent majority or certainly a 

915
00:44:34,381 --> 00:44:35,214
sizable minority.
If we're going to use the popular vote 

916
00:44:37,280 --> 00:44:41,430
that we're fed up with political 
correctness and said,

917
00:44:41,610 --> 00:44:42,443
I'm going to be the anti pc guy,
and he bet pretty much everything on 

918
00:44:46,171 --> 00:44:49,470
that and it turns out that people 
responded to it,

919
00:44:49,471 --> 00:44:49,830
right?

920
00:44:49,830 --> 00:44:52,560
He could have equivocated,
he could have been more careful with his

921
00:44:52,561 --> 00:44:54,060
words,
but he sort of,

922
00:44:54,090 --> 00:44:58,890
he flies off the handle because he 
realized that the general atmosphere was

923
00:44:58,891 --> 00:45:01,950
most people,
whether they're having chats on facebook

924
00:45:02,010 --> 00:45:06,000
or at their workplace by the water 
cooler at the university,

925
00:45:06,060 --> 00:45:06,893
are tired of feeling stifled,
are tired of feeling scared of the next 

926
00:45:10,531 --> 00:45:14,160
syllable that they might miss other that
might ruin their careers.

927
00:45:14,430 --> 00:45:17,670
And he said,
I am the anti pc warrior,

928
00:45:17,730 --> 00:45:20,370
and people responded to that marketing 
position.

929
00:45:20,730 --> 00:45:22,350
So as someone that studies all this 
stuff,

930
00:45:22,400 --> 00:45:26,250
what do you think people really drives 
people at the end of the day?

931
00:45:26,251 --> 00:45:27,330
You know,
I mentioned before,

932
00:45:27,331 --> 00:45:29,160
as I say,
often I think it's just a couple things.

933
00:45:29,161 --> 00:45:30,600
You want to have a job,
you want to have some money,

934
00:45:30,601 --> 00:45:32,640
hopefully a house,
maybe a family,

935
00:45:32,910 --> 00:45:34,050
maybe some sex,
whatever.

936
00:45:34,051 --> 00:45:36,120
Just the basic stuff that we all do.

937
00:45:36,120 --> 00:45:38,370
You think those are really just the 
undesired?

938
00:45:38,550 --> 00:45:40,440
So in,
in several of my books,

939
00:45:40,441 --> 00:45:43,290
I actually answered that question in the
following way.

940
00:45:43,530 --> 00:45:48,530
I map consumption acts onto four key 
Darwinian modules.

941
00:45:49,530 --> 00:45:52,550
So think about how maslow's hierarchy,
if you know,

942
00:45:52,890 --> 00:45:56,130
so at the basic level there's the 
physiological needs and then belonging,

943
00:45:56,400 --> 00:45:57,233
safety needs belonging.
This needs all the way up to self 

944
00:45:58,921 --> 00:46:00,300
actualization.
Well,

945
00:46:00,390 --> 00:46:04,350
his theory was really based on his 
humanistic philosophy.

946
00:46:04,530 --> 00:46:06,780
In other words,
he had this bias,

947
00:46:06,781 --> 00:46:07,614
this,
this ideological bias of how humans 

948
00:46:09,211 --> 00:46:10,044
should be.
It wasn't necessarily grounded in an 

949
00:46:11,911 --> 00:46:15,810
understanding of biology.
So I took this principal and I said,

950
00:46:15,811 --> 00:46:16,644
no,
let's see what actually drives people 

951
00:46:19,411 --> 00:46:23,460
based on biological principles.
And so my four Darwinian modules are the

952
00:46:23,461 --> 00:46:24,294
survival module.
So a lot of the things that we do are 

953
00:46:26,461 --> 00:46:31,440
related to our survival instincts.
So our preference for fatty foods,

954
00:46:31,740 --> 00:46:32,573
right?
Why is it that it's easy for us to 

955
00:46:33,631 --> 00:46:34,464
succumb to the desert effect having an 
extra piece of dessert when we've 

956
00:46:37,771 --> 00:46:39,600
already had more calories and we need 
to.

957
00:46:39,810 --> 00:46:40,643
Well,
that comes from the fact that our 

958
00:46:41,131 --> 00:46:41,964
gustatory preferences have evolved in an
environment of caloric scarcity and 

959
00:46:45,001 --> 00:46:48,840
caloric uncertainty.
So your taste buds and mine are vestiges

960
00:46:48,990 --> 00:46:51,990
of an environment long gone,
but that we've evolved to have.

961
00:46:52,080 --> 00:46:54,300
But can your brain evolved to override 
that?

962
00:46:56,440 --> 00:46:58,260
That's actually called the mismatch 
hypothesis.

963
00:46:58,261 --> 00:46:59,160
I'll come to it and sec.
Okay,

964
00:46:59,180 --> 00:47:00,510
so.
So first we've got survival,

965
00:47:00,511 --> 00:47:03,570
then we've got a reproduction,
everything related to sex.

966
00:47:03,810 --> 00:47:04,643
Why do men,
why are 99 percent of Ferrari owners 

967
00:47:07,231 --> 00:47:09,390
mail?
Because that's the form of peacocking.

968
00:47:09,391 --> 00:47:12,780
So the peacock stale is literally the 
Aston Martin that men drive,

969
00:47:12,781 --> 00:47:13,614
right?
And of course both men and women engage 

970
00:47:15,511 --> 00:47:18,090
in sexual signaling.
So first we've got survival instincts.

971
00:47:18,150 --> 00:47:21,030
We've got a reproduction,
then we've got kin selection.

972
00:47:21,031 --> 00:47:21,864
Kin Selection is the mechanism that 
explains why is it that I would jump 

973
00:47:24,271 --> 00:47:26,400
into the river to save three of my 
brothers.

974
00:47:26,610 --> 00:47:30,190
If all I care about is my survivability,
why would I ever take the risk on them?

975
00:47:30,220 --> 00:47:31,053
Well,
when you realize that a natural 

976
00:47:33,071 --> 00:47:35,500
selection operates at the level of the 
gene,

977
00:47:35,770 --> 00:47:36,603
then saving three brothers,
each of whom share half the genes with 

978
00:47:38,921 --> 00:47:40,180
me makes sense.

979
00:47:40,300 --> 00:47:40,901
Now you might say,
well,

980
00:47:40,901 --> 00:47:44,110
how do you apply that in consumer 
behavior while gift giving practices?

981
00:47:44,320 --> 00:47:45,153
Right?
So how I modulate the size of the gift 

982
00:47:47,591 --> 00:47:48,424
that I give to different people turns 
out to be perfectly correlated to the 

983
00:47:51,641 --> 00:47:54,010
genetic relatedness with each of these 
people.

984
00:47:54,070 --> 00:47:57,490
I give larger gifts to my brother than I
do to my second cousin.

985
00:47:57,670 --> 00:47:58,503
I may not do this consciously.
I may not know all these fancy theories 

986
00:48:01,450 --> 00:48:04,330
what I'm doing,
but our brains have evolved to recognize

987
00:48:04,331 --> 00:48:06,910
that people are not of equal genetic 
relatedness.

988
00:48:06,940 --> 00:48:09,580
And the fourth module is reciprocal 
altruism.

989
00:48:10,330 --> 00:48:11,163
Okay?
I jumped into the river to save three 

990
00:48:12,461 --> 00:48:13,294
brothers,
but why would I jump in to save Dave 

991
00:48:14,740 --> 00:48:15,670
Ruben?
He's not my brother.

992
00:48:15,880 --> 00:48:19,060
Well,
that comes from this evolved idea of tit

993
00:48:19,061 --> 00:48:20,830
for tat.
I scratch your back.

994
00:48:20,831 --> 00:48:21,970
You scratch mine.
Well,

995
00:48:21,971 --> 00:48:22,804
today I might jump to save you with the 
expectation that tomorrow when I'm 

996
00:48:25,421 --> 00:48:27,370
drowning,
hopefully you'll come and save me.

997
00:48:27,550 --> 00:48:30,490
So this idea of reciprocity has evolved 
for social species,

998
00:48:30,640 --> 00:48:31,473
and again,
it explains why I will invite you out 

999
00:48:33,041 --> 00:48:37,480
for dinner when it's your birthday and 
you will hopefully reciprocate when it's

1000
00:48:37,481 --> 00:48:39,460
mine.
From a strict economic perspective,

1001
00:48:39,461 --> 00:48:40,660
there's no point to this,
right?

1002
00:48:40,690 --> 00:48:43,210
Let's not invite each other.
We'll be at the same final position.

1003
00:48:43,420 --> 00:48:48,280
The reason why we do this exchange is to
oil our friendship and our bond.

1004
00:48:48,370 --> 00:48:51,610
So I argue that much of consumer 
behavior could be mapped onto these four

1005
00:48:51,611 --> 00:48:53,880
modules.
So now to your other question,

1006
00:48:54,720 --> 00:48:55,553
no,
it is very difficult for our brain to 

1007
00:48:57,131 --> 00:48:59,890
catch up to a current reality.
So for example,

1008
00:49:00,130 --> 00:49:04,330
men have evolved sex,
sexual territoriality as a,

1009
00:49:04,420 --> 00:49:06,700
as a,
as a strong element of their psychology,

1010
00:49:06,701 --> 00:49:07,534
right?
They don't like women to be promiscuous 

1011
00:49:09,821 --> 00:49:14,200
if there with them they get,
they get sexually jealous.

1012
00:49:14,260 --> 00:49:16,390
If another man touches a woman and so 
on.

1013
00:49:16,570 --> 00:49:18,620
Well why would that have evolved?
That goes both ways,

1014
00:49:18,720 --> 00:49:19,900
right?
Men and women,

1015
00:49:19,930 --> 00:49:20,980
interestingly.
Okay,

1016
00:49:20,981 --> 00:49:24,850
so that's interesting.
This is not my voice.

1017
00:49:24,870 --> 00:49:27,430
This is David buses work,
a colleague,

1018
00:49:27,460 --> 00:49:29,290
evolution psychologist at the University
of Texas,

1019
00:49:29,291 --> 00:49:31,990
Austin.
He looked at what some of his colleagues

1020
00:49:32,290 --> 00:49:36,370
at romantic infidelity versus sexual 
infidelity.

1021
00:49:36,371 --> 00:49:38,470
So he brought in people to the lab.
He,

1022
00:49:38,650 --> 00:49:39,483
he set him up with all sorts of 
physiological measures to measure their 

1023
00:49:42,191 --> 00:49:45,130
stress and had them read one of two 
vignettes.

1024
00:49:45,750 --> 00:49:46,583
Uh,
your,

1025
00:49:46,780 --> 00:49:49,220
your husband right now is,
uh,

1026
00:49:49,240 --> 00:49:52,530
having sex with the gorgeous secretary 
versus a,

1027
00:49:52,600 --> 00:49:56,020
your husband is developing an emotional 
bond with his coworker.

1028
00:49:56,021 --> 00:49:57,510
She laughs at his jokes.
They,

1029
00:49:57,520 --> 00:49:58,353
they get along.
So in one case you trigger sexual 

1030
00:50:00,461 --> 00:50:03,010
fidelity and the other one romantic 
infidelity.

1031
00:50:03,160 --> 00:50:03,993
Well,
it turns out that women respond much 

1032
00:50:05,771 --> 00:50:06,650
more,
uh,

1033
00:50:06,970 --> 00:50:10,930
adversely to romantic infidelity than to
sexual infidelity.

1034
00:50:10,931 --> 00:50:12,760
And that effect is reversed for men.

1035
00:50:13,120 --> 00:50:13,953
Now that doesn't mean that women 
appreciate sexual infidelity or are 

1036
00:50:17,291 --> 00:50:18,520
tolerant of it,
but it's less.

1037
00:50:18,521 --> 00:50:19,930
So now,
what are the reasons for it?

1038
00:50:20,230 --> 00:50:23,200
Well,
it turns out that sexual infidelity is a

1039
00:50:23,201 --> 00:50:27,470
profoundly important evolutionary 
problem for men because we're a parental

1040
00:50:27,471 --> 00:50:30,530
species where males invest a lot of 
their children.

1041
00:50:30,740 --> 00:50:33,260
It doesn't make a lot of sense for me to
invest for many,

1042
00:50:33,261 --> 00:50:36,830
many years until little johnny grows up 
to be sexually mature.

1043
00:50:36,980 --> 00:50:37,813
So then find out that it was the sexy 
Greek or Roman gardener who sired that 

1044
00:50:41,271 --> 00:50:41,990
guy,
right?

1045
00:50:41,990 --> 00:50:43,850
Therefore,
I evolve this,

1046
00:50:43,880 --> 00:50:47,930
the psychological apparatus to try to 
protect against this possibility.

1047
00:50:48,080 --> 00:50:51,470
So I am very intolerant of sexual 
infidelity.

1048
00:50:51,710 --> 00:50:52,543
If a woman cheats on a man that almost 
guarantees the end of the solution the 

1049
00:50:54,771 --> 00:50:55,940
other way around.
It doesn't.

1050
00:50:56,510 --> 00:50:57,343
On the other hand,
what's the greatest threat to a woman's 

1051
00:50:59,031 --> 00:50:59,864
interest?
It's not that he has a sexual dalliance 

1052
00:51:02,991 --> 00:51:03,650
one time.

1053
00:51:03,650 --> 00:51:06,410
This is why men very naively often will 
say,

1054
00:51:06,860 --> 00:51:09,470
I just had sex with her once.
She meant nothing to me.

1055
00:51:09,770 --> 00:51:10,603
They actually think that this is helping
because there is no emotional bond 

1056
00:51:13,821 --> 00:51:15,380
between us.
It's a one time thing,

1057
00:51:15,410 --> 00:51:16,610
right?
On the other hand,

1058
00:51:16,640 --> 00:51:21,140
if a man develops a emotional tie with a
woman,

1059
00:51:21,350 --> 00:51:22,183
that's a much greater predictor of him 
leaving the relationship and that's why 

1060
00:51:25,401 --> 00:51:28,370
women respond so adversity to emotional 
infidelity.

1061
00:51:29,120 --> 00:51:30,440
But if a man says,
well,

1062
00:51:30,441 --> 00:51:32,090
it was just a one time thing,
isn't he?

1063
00:51:32,091 --> 00:51:35,450
Then let's assume it's the truth for a 
second guy who does it one time.

1064
00:51:35,810 --> 00:51:37,820
He's telling the woman what she wants to
hear right?

1065
00:51:37,821 --> 00:51:38,201
I mean,
what,

1066
00:51:38,201 --> 00:51:39,034
what if it's true for him,
it's also what she does want to hear it 

1067
00:51:41,111 --> 00:51:42,140
because she doesn't want to hear.
Well,

1068
00:51:42,141 --> 00:51:47,141
it's certainly a much better for him to 
say it was a onetime thing rather than I

1069
00:51:47,211 --> 00:51:48,044
think I'm falling for her and we're 
planning on having sex and another 37 

1070
00:51:50,541 --> 00:51:51,374
times,
but he genuinely honestly is trying to 

1071
00:51:53,841 --> 00:51:57,350
convey to her that she literally meant 
nothing to him.

1072
00:51:57,350 --> 00:51:58,183
He's perfectly able to decouple the 
sexual act from any emotional 

1073
00:52:02,571 --> 00:52:03,404
investment.
Right.

1074
00:52:03,750 --> 00:52:06,590
When you think about when John's we'll 
go see prostitutes,

1075
00:52:06,591 --> 00:52:07,424
what do they typically tell you?
It's perfectly unencumbered sex and I'm 

1076
00:52:10,641 --> 00:52:15,641
able to have sex with her and walk away.
I pay for that walking away.

1077
00:52:15,890 --> 00:52:17,600
Right.
So again,

1078
00:52:17,601 --> 00:52:18,434
that speaks to evolved sex differences.
This whole conversation that we've had 

1079
00:52:22,430 --> 00:52:25,670
might be trans phobic,
systemic violence on their bill.

1080
00:52:25,671 --> 00:52:26,504
C,
60,

1081
00:52:26,540 --> 00:52:29,190
because look,
I didn't talk about the non or nonbinary

1082
00:52:29,250 --> 00:52:30,083
yeah,
I must be a genocide supporter 

1083
00:52:32,300 --> 00:52:33,133
naturally,
but I'm glad you just mentioned that 

1084
00:52:34,790 --> 00:52:35,623
because as you're saying is,
I'm not even exactly sure what my 

1085
00:52:37,491 --> 00:52:40,370
question is,
but is there an element a,

1086
00:52:40,371 --> 00:52:41,204
as you're sitting across from a gay 
person that enters some of the 

1087
00:52:43,790 --> 00:52:44,680
questions?
Uh,

1088
00:52:45,170 --> 00:52:47,030
I don't think we finished the mismatch 
question.

1089
00:52:47,031 --> 00:52:47,480
Oh,
okay.

1090
00:52:47,480 --> 00:52:48,230
Wait,
let's get to that.

1091
00:52:48,230 --> 00:52:51,070
Let me finish that then we'll talk about
homosexuality given me a lot here.

1092
00:52:51,080 --> 00:52:53,410
So that's why I want it to do the 
science.

1093
00:52:53,430 --> 00:52:54,410
That's why we're here.
Yeah.

1094
00:52:54,500 --> 00:52:55,333
Beautiful.
Thank you.

1095
00:52:56,420 --> 00:52:57,253
So it.
Our brains don't catch up as quickly as 

1096
00:53:02,091 --> 00:53:04,220
we otherwise would want.
So for example,

1097
00:53:04,221 --> 00:53:06,800
the fact that look,
the top killers,

1098
00:53:06,801 --> 00:53:09,260
the top medical killers,
colon cancer,

1099
00:53:09,261 --> 00:53:10,520
heart disease,
diabetes,

1100
00:53:11,030 --> 00:53:12,650
from an evolutionary medicine 
perspective,

1101
00:53:12,651 --> 00:53:13,484
the argument is that it stems from the 
fact that today we live in an 

1102
00:53:17,091 --> 00:53:17,924
environment of plenty,
but our gustatory preferences have 

1103
00:53:22,010 --> 00:53:25,220
evolved in an environment of caloric 
scar city and uncertainty.

1104
00:53:25,380 --> 00:53:26,213
That mismatch between our current 
environment of plenty and the 

1105
00:53:29,701 --> 00:53:33,480
environment in which we evolved causes 
some of these top killers.

1106
00:53:33,720 --> 00:53:35,790
So to answer your question in a long 
winded way,

1107
00:53:36,090 --> 00:53:36,923
know our brains don't catch up if there 
were selection pressures for the next x 

1108
00:53:41,881 --> 00:53:42,714
number of years to cause an evolutionary
trajectory to change that it would 

1109
00:53:46,831 --> 00:53:47,664
happen,
but typically for even the most basic 

1110
00:53:50,131 --> 00:53:53,580
genetic selection,
it might take say 5,000

1111
00:53:53,581 --> 00:53:53,940
years.

1112
00:53:53,940 --> 00:53:54,773
Right?
So I guess what I'm talking about then 

1113
00:53:56,010 --> 00:53:56,843
is for the person that never goes for 
the desert or never engines on this or 

1114
00:54:00,631 --> 00:54:02,310
that,
that's not an evolutionary thing.

1115
00:54:02,311 --> 00:54:03,144
As much as it's someone that's aware of 
someone that's educated and aware of 

1116
00:54:08,080 --> 00:54:10,980
that these things can cause health 
problems and you might be like,

1117
00:54:10,981 --> 00:54:14,420
I live here in la where everyone doesn't
eat this or that or doesn't want gluten.

1118
00:54:14,440 --> 00:54:16,260
Everyone's.
Everyone has celiac disease,

1119
00:54:16,290 --> 00:54:20,400
which no one had celiac disease.
So that's not evolution.

1120
00:54:20,401 --> 00:54:23,970
That's just sort of doing something 
different with the information you have.

1121
00:54:23,971 --> 00:54:24,804
Right?
It's not on the macro level and 

1122
00:54:25,951 --> 00:54:26,784
evolutionary thing and sometimes you 
have multiple Darwinian pools pulling 

1123
00:54:31,021 --> 00:54:34,770
you in different directions.
So that the net effect is zero.

1124
00:54:34,771 --> 00:54:35,604
So for example,
when I explained why they are 

1125
00:54:37,741 --> 00:54:38,574
evolutionary pressures for both men and 
women to cheat on their longterm 

1126
00:54:41,670 --> 00:54:44,190
partners,
that doesn't mean that it's a fatalistic

1127
00:54:44,191 --> 00:54:46,050
argument,
it's not biological determinism,

1128
00:54:46,051 --> 00:54:51,051
we're doomed to cheat because we also 
have evolved the moral calculus,

1129
00:54:51,121 --> 00:54:51,540
right?

1130
00:54:51,540 --> 00:54:52,373
Our morality.
Unless you're a religious person that 

1131
00:54:54,121 --> 00:54:54,954
thinks that it comes from God,
our morality has also evolved through 

1132
00:54:57,901 --> 00:55:01,740
the exact same evolutionary forces that 
explain why we have opposable thumbs.

1133
00:55:01,920 --> 00:55:05,550
And so on the one hand I'd like to very 
much cheat on my wife.

1134
00:55:05,640 --> 00:55:06,473
On the other hand,
I've got this moral calculus that stops 

1135
00:55:08,221 --> 00:55:11,460
me from doing the net effect is that I 
might actually not do it.

1136
00:55:11,670 --> 00:55:14,100
So this speaks to a really important 
point,

1137
00:55:14,101 --> 00:55:14,934
which is the fact that you explain 
something from an evolutionary 

1138
00:55:16,741 --> 00:55:20,880
perspective doesn't mean that it is 
biologically fatalistic.

1139
00:55:21,450 --> 00:55:22,410
Got It.
Alright.

1140
00:55:22,440 --> 00:55:24,090
So homosexuality,
yes.

1141
00:55:24,120 --> 00:55:28,080
Now if we add that into this mix that 
you're talking about here.

1142
00:55:28,110 --> 00:55:28,943
So the top theory that has been proposed
that has not the data has not 

1143
00:55:34,111 --> 00:55:36,990
cooperated,
comes from actually kin selection.

1144
00:55:36,991 --> 00:55:41,340
So let me explain this a bit technical 
so you could increase your fitness,

1145
00:55:41,341 --> 00:55:42,150
in other words,
you could,

1146
00:55:42,150 --> 00:55:45,150
you could extend your genes through 
direct reproduction.

1147
00:55:45,270 --> 00:55:46,690
That's called direct fitness,
right?

1148
00:55:46,770 --> 00:55:48,660
If I have children,
I'm extending my genes,

1149
00:55:48,990 --> 00:55:51,000
but I could also,
if you like,

1150
00:55:51,060 --> 00:55:51,893
increase my inclusive fitness by 
investing in those who are related to 

1151
00:55:55,261 --> 00:55:55,800
me.
When I.

1152
00:55:55,800 --> 00:56:00,800
When I invest in my nephews,
I am indirectly extending my jeans.

1153
00:56:00,991 --> 00:56:01,824
Correct.
So the argument then is that a 

1154
00:56:04,650 --> 00:56:05,483
homosexuality need not be a Darwinian.
Could the sock meaning a Darwinian dead 

1155
00:56:09,421 --> 00:56:10,254
end?
Because even though you may decide to 

1156
00:56:13,471 --> 00:56:17,250
not have children by investing in your 
kin,

1157
00:56:17,460 --> 00:56:19,170
you could still be extending your genes.
Now,

1158
00:56:19,171 --> 00:56:21,360
how would you test this idea while you 
would take,

1159
00:56:21,361 --> 00:56:22,194
for example,
homosexual uncles and heterosexual 

1160
00:56:24,821 --> 00:56:29,821
uncles and see if the homosexual uncles 
invest more in their nephews and nieces?

1161
00:56:30,610 --> 00:56:31,443
And if the answer would be yes,
then that would be one data point that 

1162
00:56:34,691 --> 00:56:35,524
supports the idea.
I have taught my nephew everything I 

1163
00:56:37,451 --> 00:56:42,070
know about star wars and I am very knows
every year,

1164
00:56:42,910 --> 00:56:44,380
but the data has not supported that.

1165
00:56:44,500 --> 00:56:47,920
So the bottom line is the top argument,
the top evolution,

1166
00:56:47,921 --> 00:56:51,040
if the data has not said that that 
actually happened exactly,

1167
00:56:51,050 --> 00:56:56,020
and always the that kin selection based 
argument for homosexuality,

1168
00:56:56,170 --> 00:56:58,960
while at the theoretical level,
conceptually speaking,

1169
00:56:59,220 --> 00:57:02,740
sounds good.
The data has not supported that.

1170
00:57:03,160 --> 00:57:03,993
So that's as far as I know about the 
nexus between homosexuality and 

1171
00:57:06,791 --> 00:57:09,640
evolution,
although I think we might have mentioned

1172
00:57:09,641 --> 00:57:13,190
this when you came on my show,
I do have a current doctoral student who

1173
00:57:13,200 --> 00:57:17,050
was actually planning on studying in his
doctoral dissertation,

1174
00:57:17,051 --> 00:57:20,710
the intersection between now get ready 
for this homosexuality,

1175
00:57:21,190 --> 00:57:24,460
evolutionary psychology and consumer 
behavior and how's that gonna work?

1176
00:57:24,670 --> 00:57:29,670
So we're going to look at phenomena that
typically happen between men and women.

1177
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:33,310
For example,
if you go out on a first date,

1178
00:57:33,880 --> 00:57:35,890
uh,
the best way to never have a second date

1179
00:57:35,950 --> 00:57:39,270
and the heterosexual context is for a 
man to be cheap on a first date,

1180
00:57:39,300 --> 00:57:39,700
right?

1181
00:57:39,700 --> 00:57:40,660
That guarantee.
And at the end,

1182
00:57:40,661 --> 00:57:44,980
even if the woman is a billionaire,
if he exhibits cues of frugality,

1183
00:57:45,520 --> 00:57:46,330
it's dead.
Yeah.

1184
00:57:46,330 --> 00:57:47,163
Okay.
So then let's take this idea and see 

1185
00:57:48,851 --> 00:57:51,700
whether within the context of the 
dynamics of homosexual relationship,

1186
00:57:51,900 --> 00:57:54,700
when two men go out on a date for the 
first time,

1187
00:57:55,060 --> 00:57:57,100
could we see a replication of this 
phenomenon?

1188
00:57:57,101 --> 00:58:00,820
But now there isn't male female here.
So what would be the proxy measure?

1189
00:58:01,240 --> 00:58:03,130
Top bottom.
So could,

1190
00:58:03,131 --> 00:58:03,964
for example,
your sex role as either a predominantly 

1191
00:58:06,641 --> 00:58:07,474
top or predominantly bottom replicate 
the sex differences that we typically 

1192
00:58:12,461 --> 00:58:14,980
see the interactions between men and 
women.

1193
00:58:15,190 --> 00:58:17,170
What do you think of that by the way?
Well,

1194
00:58:17,380 --> 00:58:19,930
I don't know.
It's so interesting because I don't know

1195
00:58:19,931 --> 00:58:24,190
that your sexual position has anything 
to do with how you necessarily on a date

1196
00:58:24,220 --> 00:58:26,110
would say I'm going to pay or not pay.

1197
00:58:26,280 --> 00:58:26,710
I don't know.
I,

1198
00:58:26,710 --> 00:58:27,850
I get,
I get this.

1199
00:58:27,980 --> 00:58:32,380
You were saying that basically the top 
thing that the masculine,

1200
00:58:33,270 --> 00:58:34,230
I guess,
I mean,

1201
00:58:34,270 --> 00:58:37,230
I guess it's something that's what I 
would've guessed that,

1202
00:58:37,240 --> 00:58:38,970
but I don't know that we're going to 
test something.

1203
00:58:39,550 --> 00:58:41,650
Let's take another example of exactly 
this idea.

1204
00:58:41,950 --> 00:58:42,970
Uh,
so when,

1205
00:58:42,971 --> 00:58:43,804
when men and women mate,
there's what's called assortative 

1206
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:48,040
mating.
So birds of a feather flock together.

1207
00:58:48,280 --> 00:58:49,113
So typically women,
it's not that women want necessarily 

1208
00:58:51,551 --> 00:58:53,800
tall guys,
is that they want a taller guy,

1209
00:58:53,890 --> 00:58:54,723
so it just,
it's very rare for a woman to date 

1210
00:58:57,401 --> 00:58:58,234
someone shorter than her.
So there's actually a study that was 

1211
00:58:59,951 --> 00:59:02,800
done with 720 naturally occurring 
couples,

1212
00:59:03,070 --> 00:59:08,070
only one of the seven slash 20 was the 
woman taller than the men really quick.

1213
00:59:08,560 --> 00:59:09,393
It's extraordinarily rare.
So let's now let's apply that to almost 

1214
00:59:12,790 --> 00:59:14,920
now I haven't done the research,
but here's my hypothesis.

1215
00:59:15,370 --> 00:59:20,370
I bet that the top bottom distinction 
will determine the height thing.

1216
00:59:22,161 --> 00:59:22,994
In other words,
if the bottom guy will be in a longterm 

1217
00:59:26,541 --> 00:59:31,160
union and the not a meeting and the,
the gay sauna for quick sex,

1218
00:59:31,620 --> 00:59:34,870
but longterm paragon know a marriage,
uh,

1219
00:59:34,940 --> 00:59:35,773
he'll be the shorter guy.
So a lot of the phenomena that we would 

1220
00:59:38,061 --> 00:59:38,894
pick up from evolutionary psychology as 
applied to heterosexual context will 

1221
00:59:42,711 --> 00:59:45,920
replicate in the homosexual contexts.
So I'm curious with all this being said,

1222
00:59:45,921 --> 00:59:46,580
and as you said,
you're,

1223
00:59:46,580 --> 00:59:49,820
you're hypothesizing about some of this 
stuff and obviously your,

1224
00:59:50,170 --> 00:59:52,140
your students going to work on some of 
this and other people are going to.

1225
00:59:53,320 --> 00:59:57,100
Is there a complication that links 
everything else we've been talking about

1226
00:59:57,101 --> 00:59:57,934
where if you talk about gay anything 
that this could get you in some sort of 

1227
01:00:01,881 --> 01:00:02,714
trouble?
I don't since you feel that as you're 

1228
01:00:03,651 --> 01:00:04,484
talking about it,
but that there would be some piece of 

1229
01:00:05,961 --> 01:00:06,794
this that you might find something that 
would lead you to somewhere 

1230
01:00:09,111 --> 01:00:11,670
uncomfortable or something in the 
context of academia.

1231
01:00:11,670 --> 01:00:13,160
Yeah.
I don't mean you personally well,

1232
01:00:13,320 --> 01:00:14,153
but I actually think that if you do any 
research right now on any of the Lgbtq 

1233
01:00:18,501 --> 01:00:19,334
things,
that would be a very good thing because 

1234
01:00:20,031 --> 01:00:21,800
it would be somehow label as a 
progressive.

1235
01:00:22,100 --> 01:00:22,933
So in the context of the els that you 
came to a conclusion that was not 

1236
01:00:26,361 --> 01:00:27,770
politically correct.
Yes.

1237
01:00:27,920 --> 01:00:28,753
So that speaks to actually an issue that
I've discussed with several folks and I 

1238
01:00:31,941 --> 01:00:35,210
think perhaps maybe Sam Harris mentioned
that when he had me on his show,

1239
01:00:35,360 --> 01:00:36,193
he was asking me,
is there any research that you were 

1240
01:00:37,531 --> 01:00:39,060
concerned I wanted to ask you this very 
same,

1241
01:00:39,430 --> 01:00:42,830
uh,
so maybe we can get into that at and the

1242
01:00:43,010 --> 01:00:43,843
term that I had used with him then,
which came from a paper that was 

1243
01:00:46,491 --> 01:00:48,740
published in nature.
Forbidden Knowledge.

1244
01:00:48,741 --> 01:00:49,574
No,
I am a strong non proponent of the idea 

1245
01:00:52,161 --> 01:00:53,030
of forbidden knowledge.

1246
01:00:53,360 --> 01:00:54,193
If research is done honestly said you 
Asley with a full adherence to the 

1247
01:00:59,271 --> 01:01:00,104
scientific method,
then there is no question that is taboo 

1248
01:01:03,060 --> 01:01:03,893
to ask.
That actually speaks to something in 

1249
01:01:06,471 --> 01:01:07,304
philosophy.
The difference between deontological 

1250
01:01:09,621 --> 01:01:10,454
ethics and consequentialist ethics,
the anthological ethics is the 

1251
01:01:13,131 --> 01:01:15,860
following.
It is never okay to lie.

1252
01:01:16,250 --> 01:01:17,690
That's a deal.
Anthological statement.

1253
01:01:18,020 --> 01:01:20,690
A consequentialist ethics statement 
would say,

1254
01:01:20,900 --> 01:01:25,200
well it might be okay to lie the pending
on the consequences of the lot.

1255
01:01:25,320 --> 01:01:25,880
Right?
Right.

1256
01:01:25,880 --> 01:01:28,430
If it's going to cause 20 people to die.
Exactly.

1257
01:01:28,670 --> 01:01:31,520
So one is an absolute as perspective one
is,

1258
01:01:31,550 --> 01:01:33,620
it's a situation on.
Depends on the consequences,

1259
01:01:33,860 --> 01:01:34,693
so I will use that framework to answer 
the forbidden taboo question of what 

1260
01:01:39,261 --> 01:01:44,261
kind of research is okay or not.
If you are a purist at the ontological,

1261
01:01:44,271 --> 01:01:48,020
epistemological person,
I do research wherever it takes me,

1262
01:01:48,260 --> 01:01:50,390
then you don't care about the 
consequences.

1263
01:01:50,630 --> 01:01:53,720
If you are a consequentialist bent,
then you say,

1264
01:01:53,721 --> 01:01:54,554
well,
but if we do race differences and the 

1265
01:01:57,171 --> 01:02:01,370
results come out in a way that it could 
be used to harm a racial group,

1266
01:02:01,490 --> 01:02:02,323
then we should stay away from it.
I actually think that that's a 

1267
01:02:04,311 --> 01:02:05,144
profoundly dangerous position to take 
because it's precisely this type of 

1268
01:02:08,631 --> 01:02:13,250
argument that led the social sciences to
reject biology as being important.

1269
01:02:13,670 --> 01:02:14,540
The,
the,

1270
01:02:14,750 --> 01:02:18,770
the early anthropologist cultural 
anthropologist who said biology,

1271
01:02:18,771 --> 01:02:23,190
it doesn't matter for humans were coming
from an honorable place because they saw

1272
01:02:23,310 --> 01:02:27,000
how cretins could misuse biology,
right?

1273
01:02:27,120 --> 01:02:28,620
The Nazis can say,
hey,

1274
01:02:28,621 --> 01:02:32,130
there's a battle between the races.
It's a Darwinian struggle.

1275
01:02:32,190 --> 01:02:34,380
We're area and we won.
Who Cares?

1276
01:02:34,650 --> 01:02:35,970
Let the Jews die.
Uh,

1277
01:02:35,971 --> 01:02:36,804
the British social class Aletha said 
there is a battle between the social 

1278
01:02:39,421 --> 01:02:41,280
classes,
the lower classes last,

1279
01:02:41,281 --> 01:02:42,840
screw them.
It's a Darwinian struggle,

1280
01:02:42,900 --> 01:02:44,490
of course this has nothing to do with 
Darwin,

1281
01:02:44,760 --> 01:02:49,760
but because these folks misappropriate 
misappropriated biological thinking than

1282
01:02:51,451 --> 01:02:53,130
the cultural anthropologists came along 
and said,

1283
01:02:53,250 --> 01:02:54,083
let's get rid of biology because then 
nobody can misuse it and now we're in 

1284
01:02:57,451 --> 01:02:58,284
the quagmire where we are today where we
have to appear in front of the Canadian 

1285
01:03:01,020 --> 01:03:03,150
Senate to argue that there is such a 
thing as male or female.

1286
01:03:03,330 --> 01:03:05,580
So No,
if you are a purist,

1287
01:03:05,581 --> 01:03:06,414
you pursue knowledge wherever it takes 
you unencumbered by the consequences is 

1288
01:03:10,351 --> 01:03:12,990
the problem that I suppose a certain 
amount of people,

1289
01:03:12,991 --> 01:03:17,991
scientists included probably think that 
they're a purist but actually aren't.

1290
01:03:19,280 --> 01:03:20,250
You know what I mean?
Like,

1291
01:03:20,251 --> 01:03:23,430
so,
so Mengele probably thought that,

1292
01:03:23,520 --> 01:03:24,353
you know,
who is doing all sorts of eof all Nazi 

1293
01:03:25,581 --> 01:03:26,414
on.
We're not.

1294
01:03:26,880 --> 01:03:27,713
In this particular case,
I feel that Nazi references out is 

1295
01:03:29,821 --> 01:03:30,654
actually sensible as opposed to Nazi 
references that are thrown around all 

1296
01:03:33,540 --> 01:03:33,840
day long.
But.

1297
01:03:33,840 --> 01:03:34,673
But if you think about that,
I mean Mengele was doing horrific 

1298
01:03:37,830 --> 01:03:38,663
experiments on twins and just all sorts 
of things that were considered a beyond 

1299
01:03:44,251 --> 01:03:45,300
imagination.
Horrible.

1300
01:03:45,510 --> 01:03:50,010
I'm probably believed that he was doing 
it for the good of truth and the good of

1301
01:03:50,040 --> 01:03:52,080
science and all that.
I don't.

1302
01:03:52,100 --> 01:03:52,933
You know what I mean?
I'm sure he may have been a horrific 

1303
01:03:54,271 --> 01:03:54,540
person.

1304
01:03:54,540 --> 01:03:55,373
I don't think he in his heart.
He probably thought he was doing good 

1305
01:03:57,001 --> 01:03:58,110
though,
which is so.

1306
01:03:58,111 --> 01:03:58,944
The only thing that I would say that 
would stop that from happening now is 

1307
01:04:01,411 --> 01:04:02,244
that we do have institutional review 
boards or ethics boards now that ensure 

1308
01:04:07,051 --> 01:04:07,884
that there is a boundary on the 
scientific pursuits that you could 

1309
01:04:12,580 --> 01:04:14,910
pursue,
and that is,

1310
01:04:14,911 --> 01:04:17,460
you know,
you can't frivolously harm animals.

1311
01:04:17,461 --> 01:04:19,830
The way you treat them in the lab is 
important.

1312
01:04:19,980 --> 01:04:20,813
You can't frivolously harm both 
physically and slash or psychologically 

1313
01:04:24,450 --> 01:04:27,090
human subjects right by incident.
Interestingly though,

1314
01:04:28,560 --> 01:04:30,620
now they've gone overboard,
so the,

1315
01:04:30,650 --> 01:04:31,483
the institutional review boards now have
become so aware to want to be the 

1316
01:04:35,820 --> 01:04:36,653
emphasis of Mandalay.
So that now if I asked you what is your 

1317
01:04:40,560 --> 01:04:43,320
sex right?
So that could be traumatizing.

1318
01:04:43,321 --> 01:04:45,800
If I asked you what is your income?
Well wait,

1319
01:04:45,801 --> 01:04:46,634
in some cultures that's an upfront and 
that could send the person into a 

1320
01:04:49,621 --> 01:04:50,454
tailspin of suicide because I asked him 
what his income is and so now the most 

1321
01:04:54,031 --> 01:04:58,050
banal,
innocuous questions have to be discussed

1322
01:04:58,170 --> 01:04:59,003
for 73,000
years and these institutional review 

1323
01:05:01,261 --> 01:05:04,050
boards,
so I think the fulcrum now swung too far

1324
01:05:04,051 --> 01:05:04,884
the other way so that it is now stopping
good science from being done because we 

1325
01:05:08,311 --> 01:05:10,430
are so afraid of harming any third 
party.

1326
01:05:10,510 --> 01:05:11,343
So the good intention of we actually 
don't want to harm this animal or we 

1327
01:05:14,041 --> 01:05:16,380
don't want to inject a dye into a humans
either.

1328
01:05:16,381 --> 01:05:19,500
My blind them has become now we don't 
want to offend this person.

1329
01:05:19,540 --> 01:05:21,400
Exactly right.
This is a huge jump.

1330
01:05:21,401 --> 01:05:22,990
That's dangerous for science.
Absolutely.

1331
01:05:22,991 --> 01:05:23,321
And,
and,

1332
01:05:23,321 --> 01:05:24,154
and frankly,
I see the fear and my graduate students 

1333
01:05:26,681 --> 01:05:27,514
when they're about to apply for a thesis
grant because they've heard all these 

1334
01:05:32,111 --> 01:05:34,270
horror stories that they come to me as 
professor side.

1335
01:05:34,330 --> 01:05:35,920
How long has the process of going 
through today?

1336
01:05:36,250 --> 01:05:37,083
And I always answered them.
It really depends on the makeup of the 

1337
01:05:39,821 --> 01:05:43,150
folks that are going to review your 
application.

1338
01:05:43,360 --> 01:05:48,250
If they are perfectly reasonable people,
it might go through an a session,

1339
01:05:48,520 --> 01:05:49,353
if they are absolute maniacs,
it might take us three months of 

1340
01:05:51,911 --> 01:05:55,600
rewriting this damn thing for some guy 
to finally accept that,

1341
01:05:55,601 --> 01:05:56,434
you know,
we're not injecting dye and people's 

1342
01:05:57,431 --> 01:06:02,320
fear and the reality is most of the 
research that I get involved in,

1343
01:06:02,350 --> 01:06:07,350
although it's very rigorous and 
scientific really has no downstream harm

1344
01:06:07,840 --> 01:06:08,673
that's going to be caused,
but it's unbelievable the types of 

1345
01:06:10,871 --> 01:06:11,704
concerns that people raised and,
and we need to rail the reign that in a 

1346
01:06:14,321 --> 01:06:14,690
bit.

1347
01:06:14,690 --> 01:06:15,850
Yeah.
Uh,

1348
01:06:15,851 --> 01:06:17,650
I want to talk a little bit about 
robotics,

1349
01:06:17,651 --> 01:06:18,484
which I've never even mentioned the 
phrase robot to you or any of that 

1350
01:06:21,251 --> 01:06:22,660
stuff,
but there is something about,

1351
01:06:22,661 --> 01:06:23,494
we're,
we're getting into this time with 

1352
01:06:24,041 --> 01:06:26,870
incredible automation and we know about,
you know,

1353
01:06:26,980 --> 01:06:28,930
cars that are driving themselves and we 
know that,

1354
01:06:29,170 --> 01:06:30,100
uh,
you know,

1355
01:06:30,160 --> 01:06:30,993
people ipads are going to put Mcdonald's
employees out of business and all of 

1356
01:06:33,881 --> 01:06:37,570
this stuff.
How will that affect the way we evolve?

1357
01:06:37,571 --> 01:06:38,404
How do now that we're going to add this 
thing that is completely artificial and 

1358
01:06:41,381 --> 01:06:42,214
outside of us?
Is there an evolutionary piece to that 

1359
01:06:45,220 --> 01:06:46,053
or is that something else all together?
It's something because for evolution to 

1360
01:06:49,451 --> 01:06:50,284
work right there,
there has to be a selection environment 

1361
01:06:53,290 --> 01:06:56,170
that is if,
if I'm bored,

1362
01:06:56,210 --> 01:06:57,043
let me for.
For for your viewers who may not know 

1363
01:06:58,571 --> 01:07:01,420
how evolution works,
let me explain in three seconds.

1364
01:07:01,420 --> 01:07:04,210
Okay.
Let's use a male and a female.

1365
01:07:04,211 --> 01:07:06,520
Get together through sexual 
reproduction.

1366
01:07:06,610 --> 01:07:09,940
They have an offspring.
This random combination and shuffling of

1367
01:07:09,941 --> 01:07:11,950
genes,
results in their offspring.

1368
01:07:11,951 --> 01:07:15,160
Having a blue.here,
if that blue.is

1369
01:07:15,161 --> 01:07:17,910
heritable,
it can be passed on and if that bluedoff

1370
01:07:18,040 --> 01:07:21,280
confers a survival advantage to the 
animal,

1371
01:07:21,430 --> 01:07:26,430
then the selection pressures are in 
place for eventually that blue.to

1372
01:07:26,531 --> 01:07:29,140
become part of the makeup of that 
species.

1373
01:07:29,410 --> 01:07:30,243
So to answer your question,
you would have to explain to me how 

1374
01:07:33,220 --> 01:07:34,053
there are specific selection pressures 
that affect the survivability of an 

1375
01:07:38,321 --> 01:07:39,154
organism or it's reproductive viability 
for me to be able to offer an evolution 

1376
01:07:42,891 --> 01:07:44,260
argument right now.
I can't think of one.

1377
01:07:44,680 --> 01:07:46,600
Does that make sense?
That does make sense.

1378
01:07:46,810 --> 01:07:47,643
I feel I can't end this on a question 
that we would say doesn't make sense 

1379
01:07:50,621 --> 01:07:51,454
perfectly,
so I will ask you this and we're going 

1380
01:07:53,171 --> 01:07:54,010
to do this many more times.

1381
01:07:54,040 --> 01:07:56,470
You'll do this again anytime I'm here.
Alright.

1382
01:07:56,740 --> 01:07:59,920
I'm taking everything that we've 
discussed here.

1383
01:08:00,040 --> 01:08:03,020
Are you hopeful or not for the future of
the West?

1384
01:08:03,021 --> 01:08:06,640
Do you think we are just caught in sort 
of this leftist,

1385
01:08:06,641 --> 01:08:07,474
postmodern is stuff versus a nationalism
or populism that could be dangerous or 

1386
01:08:11,981 --> 01:08:12,814
do you think that the enlightenment 
values that you care about and 

1387
01:08:14,651 --> 01:08:15,484
liberalism and all that actually has a 
chance to turn this stuff around is not 

1388
01:08:18,670 --> 01:08:20,730
where I need to put on my marketing hat 
on?

1389
01:08:20,780 --> 01:08:22,650
Yeah,
as an sell it brother.

1390
01:08:22,670 --> 01:08:23,503
Exactly.
So if I'm going to speak about some of 

1391
01:08:26,661 --> 01:08:31,220
the times when I see the tsunami of 
ostrich thinking that comes my way,

1392
01:08:31,520 --> 01:08:32,353
then I feel very pessimistic.
I feel as though an utter disaster has 

1393
01:08:35,721 --> 01:08:38,300
to happen before people wake up.
On the other hand,

1394
01:08:38,540 --> 01:08:41,870
because I'd like to peddle hope and 
market hope.

1395
01:08:42,170 --> 01:08:43,003
I think that it doesn't take too much to
redress the ship if enough silent 

1396
01:08:47,001 --> 01:08:51,200
people,
silent voices rise up in every ecosystem

1397
01:08:51,500 --> 01:08:53,320
on facebook,
on the,

1398
01:08:53,420 --> 01:08:55,430
in the media,
in academia,

1399
01:08:55,520 --> 01:08:58,680
at the bar,
and actually the,

1400
01:08:58,750 --> 01:08:59,583
you know,
trigger the courage that is necessary 

1401
01:09:01,191 --> 01:09:04,640
for them to weigh in.
I think that the voices,

1402
01:09:04,641 --> 01:09:07,430
the enemies of reason will become 
marginalized,

1403
01:09:07,670 --> 01:09:11,720
but we need to rise up and that's why I 
always tell people when they asked me,

1404
01:09:11,721 --> 01:09:12,560
well,
what can I do?

1405
01:09:12,680 --> 01:09:13,011
I said,
well,

1406
01:09:13,011 --> 01:09:16,090
you don't have to have the voice of Dave
Rubin or the platform if they ruin.

1407
01:09:16,310 --> 01:09:17,143
You just have to have enough courage to 
take on your friends when you're 

1408
01:09:20,631 --> 01:09:21,464
engaging them on facebook.
When your professor says something that 

1409
01:09:23,631 --> 01:09:26,000
seems like it's an affront to reason 
challenge,

1410
01:09:26,001 --> 01:09:26,834
him or her don't be silent.
So I think that if enough people do 

1411
01:09:29,601 --> 01:09:31,550
that,
then the ship can be addressed.

1412
01:09:31,551 --> 01:09:35,220
If we remain apathetic,
then I think we will lose the I.

1413
01:09:35,240 --> 01:09:37,760
I totally agree.
And as I always say,

1414
01:09:37,761 --> 01:09:39,980
I'm one guy that started a channel on 
Youtube.

1415
01:09:40,160 --> 01:09:42,140
You're one guy who started a channel on 
Youtube.

1416
01:09:42,141 --> 01:09:42,974
We came from very different places and 
and if our voices have done a little 

1417
01:09:45,831 --> 01:09:47,420
something,
then there's plenty of other people that

1418
01:09:47,421 --> 01:09:50,720
can replicate that and brother as well.
All right.

1419
01:09:50,930 --> 01:09:52,430
I think you guys know where his channel 
is,

1420
01:09:52,460 --> 01:09:55,950
but if not,
check out gads youtube channel a youtube

1421
01:09:56,180 --> 01:09:58,220
