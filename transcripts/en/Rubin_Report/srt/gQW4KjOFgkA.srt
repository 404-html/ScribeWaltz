1
00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:08,520
We're continuing our partnership with 
learn liberty today and joining me as an

2
00:00:08,521 --> 00:00:12,270
author and associate professor of 
Philosophy at the College of William and

3
00:00:12,271 --> 00:00:13,590
Mary.
Chris Freeman.

4
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:15,420
Welcome to the Rubin report.
Thanks for having me.

5
00:00:15,650 --> 00:00:16,440
All right,
man.

6
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:18,010
We're going to do philosophy for an 
hour.

7
00:00:18,011 --> 00:00:19,290
Are you ready?
Sounds good.

8
00:00:20,130 --> 00:00:22,920
You are prepared.
I feel the jacket shirt combo.

9
00:00:23,130 --> 00:00:25,770
It's very philosophy said.
Give me the rubin.

10
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:29,273
Let's talk philosophy because I think 
one of the things that I try to do on 

11
00:00:32,071 --> 00:00:37,050
this show is I talk about philosophies 
more than people ideas more than people.

12
00:00:37,051 --> 00:00:37,884
And it seems to me we live in a time 
where we don't do a lot of philosophy 

13
00:00:40,621 --> 00:00:41,580
and idea stuff.
Well,

14
00:00:41,581 --> 00:00:44,250
and I guess that's maybe why,
why people are watching this.

15
00:00:44,251 --> 00:00:46,440
So let's do a little philosophy one.
Oh,

16
00:00:46,450 --> 00:00:47,283
one with you.
Give me just some of the basics of what 

17
00:00:50,701 --> 00:00:52,440
people should understand about 
philosophy.

18
00:00:52,570 --> 00:00:53,350
Okay.
Well,

19
00:00:53,350 --> 00:00:54,190
yeah,
that's a great question.

20
00:00:54,270 --> 00:00:57,660
How's that for an open ended question to
start a.

21
00:00:57,780 --> 00:00:58,930
yeah,
something might take the hour,

22
00:00:58,931 --> 00:00:59,890
but uh,
yeah.

23
00:00:59,980 --> 00:01:01,260
So I think,
you know,

24
00:01:01,530 --> 00:01:02,363
at the fundamental level,
philosophy is about challenging 

25
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:05,673
assumptions.
I think one thing that makes philosophy 

26
00:01:07,391 --> 00:01:08,224
different from other sorts of academic 
disciplines is that you can't really 

27
00:01:11,501 --> 00:01:14,170
take anything for granted.
So when you're,

28
00:01:14,330 --> 00:01:15,910
you know,
doing philosophy,

29
00:01:16,060 --> 00:01:19,300
you have to justify why killing people 
is wrong,

30
00:01:19,301 --> 00:01:23,200
for example,
a why feeding the hungry is good and all

31
00:01:23,201 --> 00:01:27,610
of these things that we take for granted
at the level of everyday life philosophy

32
00:01:27,611 --> 00:01:29,830
calls into question and I think that's 
really important.

33
00:01:30,190 --> 00:01:31,023
And so the kinds of philosophical 
questions that I'm most interested in 

34
00:01:33,580 --> 00:01:37,510
are ones having to do with moral right 
and wrong justice,

35
00:01:37,511 --> 00:01:38,344
injustice,
the moral importance of economic 

36
00:01:40,361 --> 00:01:41,980
equality,
these sorts of things,

37
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:43,230
uh,
and also the,

38
00:01:43,231 --> 00:01:44,710
the ethics of public policy.

39
00:01:44,710 --> 00:01:45,543
So for example,
one thing that non philosophical 

40
00:01:48,881 --> 00:01:49,714
disciplines can do is make predictions 
about what a given policy is likely to 

41
00:01:53,921 --> 00:01:54,754
do.
So we'll opening the borders lead to 

42
00:01:56,561 --> 00:01:58,920
higher unemployment,
higher gdp,

43
00:01:58,940 --> 00:02:00,560
something like that.
Um,

44
00:02:00,670 --> 00:02:03,220
but all things considered,
they can't really tell us what the right

45
00:02:03,221 --> 00:02:04,420
thing to do is say,
okay.

46
00:02:04,421 --> 00:02:05,254
Suppose it turns out that opening 
borders will slightly increase domestic 

47
00:02:09,340 --> 00:02:10,173
unemployment,
but it also will mean that a certain 

48
00:02:13,361 --> 00:02:17,140
workers and the developing world will 
see their incomes rise by 300 percent.

49
00:02:17,141 --> 00:02:19,050
For example,
this leaves open the question,

50
00:02:19,090 --> 00:02:21,670
what should we do?
Is that a trade off that we should make?

51
00:02:21,910 --> 00:02:25,810
And that's really what philosophy tries 
to answer is what should we do,

52
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:26,860
all things considered.

53
00:02:26,950 --> 00:02:28,740
All right,
so in a little bit we're going to get to

54
00:02:28,770 --> 00:02:31,440
some of your moral philosophies that you
care about,

55
00:02:31,441 --> 00:02:33,270
an economic philosophies and,
and,

56
00:02:33,271 --> 00:02:34,104
uh,
immigration and a bunch of other things 

57
00:02:35,620 --> 00:02:38,220
in just a little bit.
But first I'm curious,

58
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:41,250
what got you interested in philosophy in
the first place?

59
00:02:41,330 --> 00:02:42,950
Yeah,
that's a good question.

60
00:02:43,490 --> 00:02:46,580
So I think it was doing philosophy 
before I realized I was doing philosophy

61
00:02:46,581 --> 00:02:47,414
because arguing,
let's say good natured arguing was the 

62
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:53,960
family tradition in my household.
So ever since I was a little kid,

63
00:02:54,170 --> 00:02:55,430
uh,
you know,

64
00:02:55,490 --> 00:02:59,030
my parents and my sister and I,
we would argue about religion and,

65
00:02:59,650 --> 00:03:01,510
and these sorts of things,
right and wrong,

66
00:03:01,810 --> 00:03:05,050
the economy.
And when I got a little bit older,

67
00:03:05,051 --> 00:03:07,600
I started reading things in philosophy 
and economics,

68
00:03:07,601 --> 00:03:09,490
columns,
articles and things like that.

69
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:10,713
And I realized that there was this kind 
of formal discipline called philosophy 

70
00:03:14,681 --> 00:03:15,514
where you could argue about right and 
wrong and justice and injustice and if 

71
00:03:18,431 --> 00:03:20,460
you were very lucky you could get a job 
doing this.

72
00:03:20,770 --> 00:03:24,490
If I get paid to do this.
Not a lot of jobs of jobs.

73
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:26,980
Not paid very much either,
but it's Kinda like saying,

74
00:03:26,981 --> 00:03:27,814
you know,
you can get paid to eat ice cream for a 

75
00:03:28,511 --> 00:03:28,780
living.

76
00:03:28,780 --> 00:03:29,640
I thought okay,
that's,

77
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:31,180
that's a pretty good gig if I can get 
it.

78
00:03:31,181 --> 00:03:34,890
And so that was Kinda the start of the 
trajectory into philosophy.

79
00:03:34,930 --> 00:03:35,441
Yeah.
You know,

80
00:03:35,441 --> 00:03:38,740
it's interesting because I came from a 
very similar family in that regard where

81
00:03:38,741 --> 00:03:39,574
we argued about everything from 
economics and religion and all those 

82
00:03:43,241 --> 00:03:44,074
things.
And I guess perhaps if this is what led 

83
00:03:45,881 --> 00:03:48,520
you here,
it's Kinda what led me here as well.

84
00:03:48,700 --> 00:03:51,790
But we're missing that these days.
Don't you think like that must infuriate

85
00:03:51,791 --> 00:03:52,624
you as someone that cares about ideas.
When you watch the news and watch all 

86
00:03:55,601 --> 00:03:56,434
these people that are aren't arguing 
from like a principled position or 

87
00:03:59,621 --> 00:04:01,870
something like philosophically thought 
out position,

88
00:04:01,871 --> 00:04:05,680
but just from like a party place or a 
partisan place must drive you nuts.

89
00:04:05,740 --> 00:04:07,240
It does.
It does because,

90
00:04:07,241 --> 00:04:08,440
right?
I care about ideas.

91
00:04:08,450 --> 00:04:10,600
I care fundamentally about good 
arguments.

92
00:04:10,780 --> 00:04:11,613
So this is something that I hope happens
to my students in my classes is they 

93
00:04:15,431 --> 00:04:16,264
come in with a set of preconceptions.
They have their partisan political 

94
00:04:19,421 --> 00:04:20,590
beliefs.
Everybody does.

95
00:04:20,591 --> 00:04:21,424
I have my partisan political beliefs,
but I hope we can try as hard as we can 

96
00:04:24,761 --> 00:04:25,594
to just focus on the arguments,
think critically and maybe change our 

97
00:04:28,781 --> 00:04:33,600
minds even if it means admitting that we
were wrong or uh,

98
00:04:33,780 --> 00:04:34,613
you know,
finding out that we have different 

99
00:04:35,201 --> 00:04:37,240
political or religious beliefs from our 
friends,

100
00:04:37,450 --> 00:04:39,850
we should really just follow wherever 
the arguments lead us.

101
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:42,760
Do you actually like it when you find 
out you were wrong on something?

102
00:04:42,761 --> 00:04:45,010
Because when I've had the moments on 
this show and the,

103
00:04:45,011 --> 00:04:45,844
and the most famous one is when I had 
larry elder in here and he just kind of 

104
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:50,190
beat me senseless with facts and you 
know,

105
00:04:50,350 --> 00:04:54,010
and we've since become friends and he 
was on just recently and I loved the guy

106
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:55,833
that it was scary in the moment,
like sitting there in the moment of 

107
00:04:57,821 --> 00:05:00,970
being beaten is not fun,
but afterwards when you go,

108
00:05:00,971 --> 00:05:03,040
Whoa,
that's what it's about.

109
00:05:03,070 --> 00:05:05,140
It's actually pretty cool.
Yes.

110
00:05:05,260 --> 00:05:07,000
So I don't like,
like you said in the moment,

111
00:05:07,001 --> 00:05:07,834
I don't like being threatened by it 
because I got a couple of things I'm 

112
00:05:09,731 --> 00:05:13,380
going to expect nothing less.
Yeah.

113
00:05:13,390 --> 00:05:14,530
But,
but longterm,

114
00:05:14,531 --> 00:05:15,970
I think that's right.
It shows growth.

115
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:16,833
And the funny thing is that what are we 
afraid of when it comes to changing our 

116
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:23,440
minds and admitting when we're wrong,
what's the harm in that?

117
00:05:23,620 --> 00:05:26,830
And I really,
I liked the process of arguing it's,

118
00:05:26,831 --> 00:05:28,870
you know,
a form of recreation or something like a

119
00:05:28,871 --> 00:05:30,780
form of exercise.
Um,

120
00:05:30,820 --> 00:05:31,653
I think,
I think it was Edmund Burke who said 

121
00:05:32,921 --> 00:05:33,754
something like,
the person who challenged my adversary 

122
00:05:35,471 --> 00:05:37,230
is actually my best friend or something 
like this.

123
00:05:37,231 --> 00:05:38,064
So the person that is willing to argue 
with you in good faith and genuinely 

124
00:05:41,591 --> 00:05:42,424
cares about getting at what's true 
rather than what maybe confirms their 

125
00:05:46,541 --> 00:05:47,960
prior political beliefs,
that's,

126
00:05:48,130 --> 00:05:48,963
you know,
that's the person that I want to hang 

127
00:05:49,391 --> 00:05:51,460
out with.
I just don't want to talk with one of my

128
00:05:51,461 --> 00:05:53,140
best friends growing up.
Uh,

129
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:54,033
his name's are Greek,
so he was all into Greek philosophy and 

130
00:05:56,171 --> 00:05:58,010
all that and he was my intellectual 
sparring

131
00:05:58,010 --> 00:06:02,300
partner for them from,
from literally from 12 years old til,

132
00:06:02,301 --> 00:06:03,560
well past college.
Even now.

133
00:06:03,561 --> 00:06:04,394
And we ironically,
we actually agree more now than ever 

134
00:06:06,501 --> 00:06:07,334
before,
which is sort of weird because we both 

135
00:06:08,721 --> 00:06:12,530
had sort of reverse a philosophical 
journeys or political journeys.

136
00:06:12,531 --> 00:06:13,364
But that's actually what it's all about.
So tell me a little bit about some of 

137
00:06:15,831 --> 00:06:17,750
the philosophers that have affected you.

138
00:06:18,770 --> 00:06:21,080
So one of my favorites is probably John 
Stuart Mill.

139
00:06:21,260 --> 00:06:24,830
So he was a classical liberal.
He so his,

140
00:06:24,831 --> 00:06:25,664
what's known as a utilitarian,
and this is a moral theory that 

141
00:06:27,771 --> 00:06:28,604
essentially says the right thing to do 
is the thing that has the best 

142
00:06:31,221 --> 00:06:32,054
consequences,
the thing that produces the most 

143
00:06:33,351 --> 00:06:36,200
happiness for everybody who's affected,
I find that view,

144
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:38,060
attractive and,
and moral philosophy.

145
00:06:38,210 --> 00:06:40,850
But he was also,
he was a classical liberal politically,

146
00:06:41,180 --> 00:06:42,013
uh,
he was a big defender of free speech 

147
00:06:44,060 --> 00:06:44,893
free discussion in particular.
His book on Liberty is probably the 

148
00:06:47,421 --> 00:06:49,910
single greatest defense of freedom of 
speech.

149
00:06:50,060 --> 00:06:51,110
I traveled with it,
you know,

150
00:06:51,111 --> 00:06:52,580
I'm on tour right now.
I travel with it.

151
00:06:52,581 --> 00:06:54,420
It's a thin book.
Everyone should have it.

152
00:06:56,170 --> 00:06:57,530
Yeah,
that's right.

153
00:06:57,740 --> 00:06:59,250
Yeah.
So what.

154
00:06:59,570 --> 00:07:01,100
Okay.
So you mentioned classical liberalism.

155
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:02,540
Okay.
Everyone knows my feelings on this.

156
00:07:02,541 --> 00:07:03,374
Do you see any meaningful distinction 
between classical liberalism and 

157
00:07:06,051 --> 00:07:07,730
libertarianism at this point?

158
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:10,233
I think that libertarianism is probably 
a bit narrower than classical 

159
00:07:14,501 --> 00:07:15,334
liberalism,
so,

160
00:07:15,420 --> 00:07:16,253
but this is a matter of debate.
I don't have a very firm opinion on 

161
00:07:18,491 --> 00:07:20,140
this,
but when I think of a libertarian,

162
00:07:20,141 --> 00:07:24,010
I think of somebody who says the state 
should do the following.

163
00:07:24,011 --> 00:07:28,270
Three things have a court system have 
police force,

164
00:07:28,570 --> 00:07:31,780
um,
and maybe enforced contracts,

165
00:07:31,810 --> 00:07:33,100
something like that,
no more,

166
00:07:33,101 --> 00:07:33,934
maybe some kind of very small social 
minimum Milton Friedman negative income 

167
00:07:37,721 --> 00:07:38,554
tax type thing.
Whereas I think classical liberals are 

168
00:07:40,781 --> 00:07:41,614
more friendly to a more active state,
but I would also say that I'm happy to 

169
00:07:45,401 --> 00:07:48,670
say that libertarians are part of the 
classical liberal family.

170
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:49,633
Yeah.
It's funny because I had done boudreaux 

171
00:07:51,881 --> 00:07:56,881
and here a couple of weeks ago talking 
about this and I fall on that path where

172
00:07:57,031 --> 00:07:59,750
the more I go down the libertarian roots
I really liked.

173
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:00,593
I liked that line of thinking.
I still think there's some utility of 

174
00:08:02,941 --> 00:08:05,340
the state,
but I think the more that you have these

175
00:08:05,341 --> 00:08:07,350
conversations,
for me,

176
00:08:07,351 --> 00:08:10,800
I'm finding it harder and harder to 
defend anything related to the state,

177
00:08:10,801 --> 00:08:11,634
which is a.
I Guess I'm taking a philosophically 

178
00:08:13,831 --> 00:08:16,290
fair approach to this because I'm taking
in new information.

179
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:17,470
Yeah.
Yeah.

180
00:08:17,471 --> 00:08:18,280
I,
I'm,

181
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:19,113
I'm the same way.
So I think that the best arguments for 

182
00:08:22,211 --> 00:08:26,920
something like classical liberalism or 
libertarianism is just the pervasiveness

183
00:08:26,921 --> 00:08:29,020
of government failure.
So you know,

184
00:08:29,021 --> 00:08:31,950
you look at where actual government 
money goes,

185
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:34,450
not just not in theory,
but in practice where it goes,

186
00:08:34,690 --> 00:08:35,523
um,
what sorts of groups are advantaged and 

187
00:08:37,241 --> 00:08:40,510
disadvantaged by the state?
I think that the government just doesn't

188
00:08:40,660 --> 00:08:41,493
work very well and so the same reasons 
why we don't want the government 

189
00:08:44,321 --> 00:08:46,180
producing food,
for example,

190
00:08:46,510 --> 00:08:49,690
are also reasons why we might not want 
the government in the business of say,

191
00:08:49,730 --> 00:08:50,563
running school.

192
00:08:50,660 --> 00:08:51,493
Right?
So do you think it will be fair to say 

193
00:08:51,911 --> 00:08:56,070
that if it ran well,
if this thing was a slim trim operation

194
00:08:56,070 --> 00:08:56,903
and it was financially sensible and we 
had people of good moral character in 

195
00:09:00,091 --> 00:09:00,924
the government in the rest of it,
that you'd actually have no reason to 

196
00:09:02,611 --> 00:09:03,444
be.
Certainly a libertarian and me perhaps 

197
00:09:04,351 --> 00:09:06,420
even a classical liberal,
you might actually be more,

198
00:09:06,430 --> 00:09:10,080
have some sort of big government 
democrat or something like that.

199
00:09:10,170 --> 00:09:12,510
I think that's right.
So at least from my perspective,

200
00:09:12,511 --> 00:09:15,420
so as I said,
I'm a fan of mill and utilitarianism.

201
00:09:15,421 --> 00:09:18,360
The idea that the right thing is the 
thing that produces the best results.

202
00:09:18,660 --> 00:09:22,650
And so I think in a world in which the 
state was run by angels,

203
00:09:22,651 --> 00:09:24,720
very wise people,
very benevolent people,

204
00:09:24,721 --> 00:09:28,380
and it produced good results.
I would be happy to accept a,

205
00:09:28,430 --> 00:09:31,710
a big activist government or regulatory 
and redistributive state,

206
00:09:31,890 --> 00:09:35,220
but I think that are very powerful 
reasons for thinking that that's not the

207
00:09:35,221 --> 00:09:36,090
world that we live in.

208
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:37,193
So I think that some of my audience,
when they hear you talk about mill and 

209
00:09:39,601 --> 00:09:40,434
what's best for everyone,
they're going to view that through some 

210
00:09:43,321 --> 00:09:46,350
sort of lens of collectivism,
which is going to set some bells off.

211
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:48,390
So can you unpack that a little bit,
right?

212
00:09:48,780 --> 00:09:49,221
Yeah.
So,

213
00:09:49,221 --> 00:09:51,810
so for,
for what it's worth,

214
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:55,770
my view is that a system that produces 
the most happiness,

215
00:09:55,771 --> 00:09:56,604
the most flourishing,
the most prosperity is something like a 

216
00:09:58,591 --> 00:10:00,090
libertarian,
minimal state,

217
00:10:00,091 --> 00:10:00,924
perhaps with a small social minimum.
So when you look historically at 

218
00:10:05,461 --> 00:10:06,294
collectivist regimes,
say the Soviet Union or North Korea or 

219
00:10:09,150 --> 00:10:09,983
something like that,
these don't have a good track record of 

220
00:10:11,731 --> 00:10:12,564
making people happy.
When you look at the societies that 

221
00:10:14,671 --> 00:10:18,030
actually make people happy compared to 
the alternative,

222
00:10:18,220 --> 00:10:22,150
they tend to be liberty limited.
Government free market,

223
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:25,780
a civil libertarian ish kind of states.
Alright.

224
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:28,140
So what other philosophers that's 
affected you?

225
00:10:28,740 --> 00:10:29,830
You're one for one.
Yeah,

226
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:31,680
John Stuart Mill.
Right up the top.

227
00:10:31,770 --> 00:10:33,270
I'll give you somebody who you might not
like,

228
00:10:33,271 --> 00:10:34,470
although he might not be familiar with 
them.

229
00:10:34,740 --> 00:10:39,540
Peter Singer who's a contemporary 
utilitarian and a lot of people.

230
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:44,840
I think a lot of classical liberals and 
libertarians aren't big fans of his,

231
00:10:45,181 --> 00:10:48,450
although I think they need not,
not be fans of his.

232
00:10:48,690 --> 00:10:50,850
So he's a,
he's famous for a number of things.

233
00:10:50,851 --> 00:10:53,820
He has a number of very controversial 
positions on a lot of things,

234
00:10:54,870 --> 00:10:55,703
but one of his more famous thought 
experiments involves you will imagining 

235
00:10:59,521 --> 00:11:00,354
that you're a walking somewhere and you 
pass a small child who is drowning in a 

236
00:11:04,381 --> 00:11:08,070
shallow pond and you can save this child
at a very low cost to you.

237
00:11:08,370 --> 00:11:09,030
Uh,
all,

238
00:11:09,030 --> 00:11:09,863
all that's required is that you step 
into the pond to get your shoes muddy 

239
00:11:12,450 --> 00:11:13,530
and pulled the child out.

240
00:11:13,530 --> 00:11:16,350
But this means you'll have to spend 100 
bucks on new shoes.

241
00:11:16,740 --> 00:11:17,573
And he says,
clearly the sacrifice of $100 worth of 

242
00:11:20,191 --> 00:11:24,210
shoes is worth saving this child.
And so this suggests that we have strong

243
00:11:24,211 --> 00:11:28,360
obligations to make personal sacrifices 
for the betterment of the world's poor.

244
00:11:28,450 --> 00:11:29,850
And I think that's right,
uh,

245
00:11:29,851 --> 00:11:32,490
as at the level of moral principle,
for example.

246
00:11:32,610 --> 00:11:33,443
But I think a lot of libertarians and 
classical liberals worry that what this 

247
00:11:36,721 --> 00:11:40,710
is going to mean is we ought to have 
large welfare states.

248
00:11:40,711 --> 00:11:44,940
We ought to have billions of dollars 
channeled into foreign aid and so on.

249
00:11:44,941 --> 00:11:47,370
And I can understand why they make that 
leap.

250
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:49,320
But I don't think that follows,
especially again,

251
00:11:49,321 --> 00:11:50,154
if you look at the track record of 
whether or not the government does a 

252
00:11:52,501 --> 00:11:55,150
good job of helping the poor and I think
it generally doesn't.

253
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:55,801
Yeah.
So,

254
00:11:55,801 --> 00:11:57,790
and I definitely want to get to your 
thoughts on that.

255
00:11:57,790 --> 00:12:01,330
So do you view that sort of is like that
sort of like a micro macro argument that

256
00:12:01,331 --> 00:12:02,530
at a micro level,
yeah,

257
00:12:02,531 --> 00:12:03,364
you'd probably do it.
Like I'm sure if either one of us were 

258
00:12:04,991 --> 00:12:05,824
walking down the street,
we wouldn't care that much about our 

259
00:12:07,361 --> 00:12:08,740
shoes.
Enabled to save somebody,

260
00:12:08,741 --> 00:12:09,574
but at a societal level,
we'd probably get swept out of your 

261
00:12:11,801 --> 00:12:12,634
economic arguments as well.
The more that you keep giving over to 

262
00:12:14,591 --> 00:12:15,424
society,
the more that it keeps taking in 

263
00:12:17,940 --> 00:12:21,580
essence,
individuals in their private lives,

264
00:12:21,710 --> 00:12:23,380
uh,
if they do a good job of saying,

265
00:12:23,410 --> 00:12:24,243
researching which private charities do a
good job of alleviating poverty in the 

266
00:12:27,341 --> 00:12:28,960
developing world.
And I think there are some,

267
00:12:29,290 --> 00:12:30,123
then we would have in some sense in some
sense of societal obligation to help 

268
00:12:34,140 --> 00:12:39,140
just in the sense that most people of 
means have this obligation to say donate

269
00:12:39,671 --> 00:12:42,880
some of their paycheck to the against 
malaria foundation for example.

270
00:12:43,150 --> 00:12:43,983
But I think that doesn't justify saying 
we want the state in the business of 

271
00:12:47,621 --> 00:12:49,980
redistributing income,
uh,

272
00:12:50,230 --> 00:12:51,063
on a global level if only because it 
just doesn't do a very good job of it 

273
00:12:53,741 --> 00:12:56,980
and oftentimes makes poverty even worse.
All right,

274
00:12:56,981 --> 00:13:00,160
so you are a blogger at bleeding heart 
libertarian.

275
00:13:01,180 --> 00:13:02,013
Now,
I've seen this site before and check it 

276
00:13:02,711 --> 00:13:03,710
out again before,
uh,

277
00:13:03,730 --> 00:13:06,580
before you got here.
But I thought the phrase bleeding heart,

278
00:13:06,581 --> 00:13:07,414
libertarians,
that sort of sounds like what a 

279
00:13:08,951 --> 00:13:10,580
classical liberal is like,
right?

280
00:13:10,590 --> 00:13:13,030
We got a little,
a little more heart in essence,

281
00:13:13,031 --> 00:13:16,930
where we were okay with a little more 
state to hopefully make sure that people

282
00:13:16,931 --> 00:13:17,764
who need it the most are okay,
but I think a lot of people will see 

283
00:13:19,931 --> 00:13:21,550
those terms at odds.
Bleeding,

284
00:13:21,551 --> 00:13:22,690
heart,
libertarian.

285
00:13:22,691 --> 00:13:23,630
Yeah.
No,

286
00:13:23,700 --> 00:13:25,510
and that's a great,
a great point too.

287
00:13:25,511 --> 00:13:27,460
In light of the conversation about Peter
Singer,

288
00:13:27,461 --> 00:13:28,294
because I do think that we have,
and I think a lot of classical liberals 

289
00:13:30,491 --> 00:13:31,324
agree that we have this strong 
obligation to uphold political 

290
00:13:35,261 --> 00:13:38,320
institutions that work particularly well
for the poor.

291
00:13:38,470 --> 00:13:40,840
And this isn't,
even though the term a bleeding heart,

292
00:13:40,841 --> 00:13:43,660
libertarians is new.
This isn't just something that popped up

293
00:13:43,661 --> 00:13:44,494
in the last five or six years.
If you go all the way back to Adam 

294
00:13:46,630 --> 00:13:47,550
Smith,
he has this,

295
00:13:47,570 --> 00:13:51,160
this argument about the division of 
Labor and free trade.

296
00:13:51,250 --> 00:13:52,470
He says,
you know,

297
00:13:52,510 --> 00:13:55,690
you sitting at your desk trying to make 
pins all by yourself.

298
00:13:55,691 --> 00:13:57,280
Maybe you could do two or three in a 
day.

299
00:13:57,490 --> 00:14:01,230
You have a division of labor where one 
person straightening up the wire,

300
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:03,790
the other person's putting the pin on 
the on the wire and so forth,

301
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:07,390
makes us massively more productive than 
we otherwise could be,

302
00:14:07,540 --> 00:14:10,840
and then through free trade are 
everybody's welfare is increased,

303
00:14:11,110 --> 00:14:11,943
but he stresses that this is 
particularly good for the poor because 

304
00:14:14,861 --> 00:14:19,330
he says a society in which we're very 
productive and we have this abundance of

305
00:14:19,331 --> 00:14:20,164
material goods is a society in which 
these sorts of goods are going to be a 

306
00:14:22,961 --> 00:14:24,910
lot cheaper and this is in fact what we 
see,

307
00:14:25,070 --> 00:14:27,730
uh,
and so a society in which the real price

308
00:14:27,820 --> 00:14:28,653
of not just necessities but also things 
that we might consider luxuries like 

309
00:14:31,811 --> 00:14:32,644
smartphones or something,
a society that makes those abundant and 

310
00:14:34,451 --> 00:14:37,000
cheap is a society that's very good for 
the poor.

311
00:14:37,150 --> 00:14:37,983
So I think a bleeding heart libertarian 
or classical perspective is hundreds of 

312
00:14:40,871 --> 00:14:41,704
years old,
although you'd probably w we haven't 

313
00:14:43,541 --> 00:14:45,580
done a good job of marketing ourselves 
perhaps.

314
00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:46,473
Yeah.
How would you actually define what good 

315
00:14:48,430 --> 00:14:51,300
is that too tough for them?
Yeah,

316
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:52,251
that's right.
Yeah.

317
00:14:52,251 --> 00:14:53,540
That's a,
that's a big question.

318
00:14:53,750 --> 00:14:54,583
So the,
here's the evasive answer is it depends 

319
00:14:57,051 --> 00:15:00,030
on which philosopher you're talking.
Yeah.

320
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:00,913
So,
so some philosophers think that so mill 

321
00:15:02,901 --> 00:15:06,230
has this view that the code consists of 
pleasure,

322
00:15:06,260 --> 00:15:07,093
but it's a sophisticated view where some
pleasures are of higher quality than 

323
00:15:10,311 --> 00:15:11,144
others.
So if I don't know you have pleasure as 

324
00:15:14,601 --> 00:15:15,434
a result of shooting up heroin and 
that's equal in intensity and duration 

325
00:15:18,621 --> 00:15:20,780
to the pleasure that you get from 
reading Shakespeare.

326
00:15:20,990 --> 00:15:21,823
There's something qualitatively better 
about the Shakespeare's and then the 

327
00:15:24,801 --> 00:15:25,634
heroin.
And so that's his view is that it's a 

328
00:15:27,321 --> 00:15:29,460
life of pleasure,
but where you have these high,

329
00:15:29,690 --> 00:15:31,970
higher and lower pleasures,
other people,

330
00:15:31,971 --> 00:15:33,160
other utilitarians think,
oh,

331
00:15:33,170 --> 00:15:34,640
pleasure is created equal.

332
00:15:35,180 --> 00:15:40,180
Other people have a maybe more 
complicated views were a bunch of stuff,

333
00:15:40,490 --> 00:15:43,100
makes a life good.
So it's pleasure.

334
00:15:43,340 --> 00:15:44,173
It's knowledge,
it's living the morally virtuous life 

335
00:15:46,431 --> 00:15:47,264
and so on.
And this is a debate that we've been 

336
00:15:48,951 --> 00:15:53,951
having for $200 or 2000,
500 years with no end in sight.

337
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:56,300
I sense,
I know where you stand on that,

338
00:15:56,301 --> 00:15:58,780
but you want to elaborate on that a 
little bit more.

339
00:15:58,940 --> 00:16:00,230
Well,
so I think that the,

340
00:16:00,510 --> 00:16:01,343
yeah,
so it's a good question because you're 

341
00:16:02,301 --> 00:16:04,050
here as long as I'm here.
So what,

342
00:16:04,070 --> 00:16:05,480
what is good?
Well,

343
00:16:05,481 --> 00:16:08,930
so I think the good for a particular 
person is probably,

344
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:10,033
um,
what a philosopher would call the 

345
00:16:11,061 --> 00:16:13,520
satisfaction of your informed 
preferences.

346
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:14,593
So essentially getting what you want,
if you know what it is that you're 

347
00:16:18,171 --> 00:16:19,490
getting.
So for example,

348
00:16:19,730 --> 00:16:20,563
you might want the liquid that is in 
their glass right now because you have 

349
00:16:24,231 --> 00:16:26,840
the belief that it's water,
but if you have the fall,

350
00:16:26,870 --> 00:16:29,780
if that belief is false because it turns
out to be vodka or something like that,

351
00:16:29,781 --> 00:16:31,280
you might have a desire for what's in 
there,

352
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:34,790
but the desire is in some sense informed
by this false belief.

353
00:16:34,910 --> 00:16:39,350
But if you had perfectly true beliefs 
about the world and then you desired say

354
00:16:39,351 --> 00:16:40,400
that cup of water,
I said,

355
00:16:40,401 --> 00:16:41,840
well that's good for you to get that 
water.

356
00:16:41,841 --> 00:16:43,330
You're getting what you want.
Yeah.

357
00:16:43,580 --> 00:16:46,760
So you basically believe that 
selfishness is good.

358
00:16:47,260 --> 00:16:49,580
No,
because I think that a lot of people,

359
00:16:49,581 --> 00:16:52,760
I think most people in fact have 
preferences,

360
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:55,970
rational preferences for the welfare of 
other people.

361
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:57,570
So I would say,
you know,

362
00:16:57,590 --> 00:16:59,720
most,
can you make a selfish argument for that

363
00:17:00,110 --> 00:17:01,610
because the way I've always sort of 
understand,

364
00:17:01,611 --> 00:17:05,930
or at least the way I use these words 
now is by doing what is good for me.

365
00:17:06,080 --> 00:17:08,930
That doesn't mean I want to ransack the 
entire world.

366
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:12,470
I want to do good so that it's good for 
my community.

367
00:17:12,471 --> 00:17:15,560
I want to take care of my own house so 
that my neighbor,

368
00:17:15,561 --> 00:17:16,394
hopefully it will be like I'm next door 
to someone with a nice house and we're 

369
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:19,550
going to take care of their eyes.

370
00:17:19,700 --> 00:17:20,533
So I've used selfishly,
I guess that's a little more of ran 

371
00:17:22,250 --> 00:17:25,010
thing where I've used selfishness 
actually as a virtue.

372
00:17:25,670 --> 00:17:26,503
Yeah.
So I think the difference would be in 

373
00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:28,213
say a case where you're,
you're a walking and see the child 

374
00:17:31,221 --> 00:17:33,650
drowning on the shallow pond,
the question would be,

375
00:17:33,651 --> 00:17:34,484
well,
what is the reason why you're saving 

376
00:17:35,631 --> 00:17:36,464
this child and ruining their boots?
I think a good answer to that as well 

377
00:17:39,561 --> 00:17:41,270
because they care about the child's 
welfare.

378
00:17:41,540 --> 00:17:43,250
Um,
and then sometimes it's true that that's

379
00:17:43,251 --> 00:17:45,920
a preference that you have.
So it's your preference.

380
00:17:45,921 --> 00:17:49,800
And so you could call it a sort of self 
guided or self preference,

381
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:50,933
but I wouldn't call it a selfish 
preference in the sense that you expect 

382
00:17:54,391 --> 00:17:55,224
in some sense a this child's welfare to 
directly translate into benefits for 

383
00:17:59,671 --> 00:18:00,421
you.
Right?

384
00:18:00,421 --> 00:18:01,254
But you would feel good after,
I guess like you wouldn't if you'd be a 

385
00:18:03,781 --> 00:18:05,490
pretty twisted person if you were like,
well,

386
00:18:05,750 --> 00:18:06,820
walking by like,
well what,

387
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:08,780
how's that gonna make me feel after a 
little,

388
00:18:08,810 --> 00:18:10,420
you should,
you should do what's right.

389
00:18:10,530 --> 00:18:13,800
But I know what's right can often lead 
to all sorts of bad things.

390
00:18:14,970 --> 00:18:17,310
But I think you could make a selfish 
argument for that.

391
00:18:17,311 --> 00:18:20,340
Like you know that if you walk by a 
child that you could easily help and you

392
00:18:20,341 --> 00:18:21,930
don't,
you're going to feel shitty after if you

393
00:18:21,931 --> 00:18:25,020
have any shred of conscious.
Right.

394
00:18:25,230 --> 00:18:29,220
So I hope right on sociopaths,
I hope have that,

395
00:18:29,221 --> 00:18:32,530
have that sort of psychological 
disposition and as far as sort of once.

396
00:18:32,540 --> 00:18:33,373
So I think also what morality is more 
concerned with is not just the good of 

397
00:18:35,611 --> 00:18:37,410
the individual,
but sort of the good of all.

398
00:18:37,590 --> 00:18:38,423
So I think for what the morally right 
thing to do is figuring out the 

399
00:18:41,521 --> 00:18:42,354
decision.
So this is the kind of million 

400
00:18:43,381 --> 00:18:44,214
utilitarian view that the right thing to
do is basically that which produces the 

401
00:18:47,551 --> 00:18:50,460
most good for everybody,
not just an individual person.

402
00:18:50,460 --> 00:18:52,600
So it could be in some cases that,
uh,

403
00:18:52,850 --> 00:18:57,150
a person's individual good comes apart 
from what's morally good.

404
00:18:57,151 --> 00:19:00,780
So you could imagine somebody who just 
has no desire to help other people.

405
00:19:00,900 --> 00:19:01,733
I would still say they're doing 
something morally wrong if they fail to 

406
00:19:03,331 --> 00:19:04,164
help other people because they're not 
taking that person's welfare into 

407
00:19:06,361 --> 00:19:07,170
account.
Right.

408
00:19:07,170 --> 00:19:08,003
So where do you think morals come from?
This has been an ongoing discussion on 

409
00:19:12,451 --> 00:19:13,750
this show between,
you know,

410
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:16,970
talking to Jordan Peterson and bench and
Sam Harris and Michael Shermer,

411
00:19:17,010 --> 00:19:18,720
Dennis Prager,
and many others.

412
00:19:18,721 --> 00:19:20,160
And there's sort of a religious 
argument.

413
00:19:20,161 --> 00:19:22,380
I think there's a secular argument for 
it.

414
00:19:22,710 --> 00:19:24,990
Um,
I think I'm somewhere in the middle.

415
00:19:24,991 --> 00:19:25,824
I think it's a really rich spot to 
figure out what people think about 

416
00:19:27,991 --> 00:19:28,980
things.
Yeah.

417
00:19:28,981 --> 00:19:30,150
So that's,
that's a,

418
00:19:30,330 --> 00:19:31,800
that's a hard question.
Uh,

419
00:19:31,860 --> 00:19:33,970
I'm not sure I have a satisfying answer 
to that.

420
00:19:33,970 --> 00:19:34,803
So,
but maybe in terms of the religious 

421
00:19:35,941 --> 00:19:38,550
question there,
this very old argument from Plato,

422
00:19:38,551 --> 00:19:41,100
the EUTHYPHRO dilemma.
I'm not sure if that's ever popped up in

423
00:19:41,101 --> 00:19:43,200
conversation,
but the idea is basically,

424
00:19:43,650 --> 00:19:44,250
uh,
does,

425
00:19:44,250 --> 00:19:45,083
does God will something because it's 
pious independently of God's will or is 

426
00:19:49,141 --> 00:19:52,410
it pious because God wills it and 
Plato's view was,

427
00:19:52,590 --> 00:19:53,423
well,
uh,

428
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:54,673
it doesn't quite make sense to say that 
it's pious just because God wills it 

429
00:19:58,290 --> 00:20:02,100
because you could imagine as a thought 
experiment that God willing all sorts of

430
00:20:02,190 --> 00:20:04,800
terrible family just as,
as a thought experiment that,

431
00:20:04,890 --> 00:20:05,723
you know,
if God wills us to torture it doesn't 

432
00:20:08,791 --> 00:20:10,980
seem like that would make torture good.
Um,

433
00:20:11,100 --> 00:20:11,933
and so it seems more plausible to think 
that there is sort of an independent 

434
00:20:15,931 --> 00:20:19,020
standard of goodness even,
even if you are a theist,

435
00:20:19,021 --> 00:20:19,850
for example,
in,

436
00:20:19,850 --> 00:20:20,683
in,
you believe in God and you believe God 

437
00:20:21,871 --> 00:20:23,460
has this intimate connection to 
morality.

438
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:27,960
I think even on views like that,
it make sense to say that goodness is in

439
00:20:27,961 --> 00:20:30,570
some sense independent of the will of 
God.

440
00:20:30,870 --> 00:20:33,810
And so in terms of what more,
that's again,

441
00:20:33,811 --> 00:20:38,220
sort of an evasive answer as to what.
It's not a where morality comes from.

442
00:20:38,221 --> 00:20:39,510
I mean,
I'm inclined to say it.

443
00:20:39,620 --> 00:20:40,453
I mean it comes from sort of what's good
for human beings and maybe other and 

444
00:20:44,370 --> 00:20:45,203
animals.
So what sorts of things satisfy or 

445
00:20:46,511 --> 00:20:49,660
interest to our preferences causes 
pleasure and pain,

446
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:50,673
these sorts of things.

447
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:51,633
Do you think that subjective though,
that the different cultures obviously 

448
00:20:54,311 --> 00:20:58,180
have different beliefs and different 
moralities and all sorts of things?

449
00:20:58,540 --> 00:20:59,373
I would say it is not subjective in the 
sense that a different different 

450
00:21:04,931 --> 00:21:05,764
cultures having different moral beliefs 
would show that nobody's wrong in those 

451
00:21:09,071 --> 00:21:09,904
debates.
So it might be very difficult to 

452
00:21:10,601 --> 00:21:11,434
determine who is wrong,
but I don't think the mere fact that 

453
00:21:13,361 --> 00:21:16,990
different cultures have moral standards 
shows that it's subjective.

454
00:21:17,230 --> 00:21:18,840
So by analogy,
uh,

455
00:21:18,910 --> 00:21:22,960
you could imagine different cultures 
having different beliefs about astrology

456
00:21:22,961 --> 00:21:25,450
for example.
So some cultures think that astrology is

457
00:21:25,510 --> 00:21:27,280
legitimate enterprise.
Other ones don't.

458
00:21:27,670 --> 00:21:28,503
They disagree about that.
But I think it's safe to say that there 

459
00:21:30,461 --> 00:21:33,670
is in some sense and objectively correct
answer about that.

460
00:21:33,820 --> 00:21:34,653
Uh,
same thing with other sorts of 

461
00:21:35,531 --> 00:21:37,000
scientific disputes,
right?

462
00:21:37,090 --> 00:21:38,980
But do you think that that objective 
place,

463
00:21:38,981 --> 00:21:42,970
does that have to come from God per se?
Or can it come from,

464
00:21:43,060 --> 00:21:43,391
I mean,
the,

465
00:21:43,391 --> 00:21:45,820
the discussion that we've had a lot 
around here that a lot of people in this

466
00:21:45,821 --> 00:21:50,380
space talk about basically is,
does objective morality either come from

467
00:21:50,381 --> 00:21:54,310
God and religion or does it come from 
enlightened enlightenment and values?

468
00:21:54,550 --> 00:21:55,383
And then there's other arguments that 
it's only through religion that we got 

469
00:21:58,630 --> 00:22:00,210
to enlightenment values in the.

470
00:22:01,220 --> 00:22:02,970
Yeah,
that's tough.

471
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:06,870
My hunch is that something like 
enlightenment values,

472
00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:08,520
um,
so I don't know.

473
00:22:08,521 --> 00:22:11,520
I'm somewhere in the agnostic space,
uh,

474
00:22:11,550 --> 00:22:12,720
myself.
Uh,

475
00:22:13,260 --> 00:22:15,200
and so I think that sort of philosophy 
guy,

476
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:16,051
right?
Exactly.

477
00:22:16,051 --> 00:22:19,230
So it's hard not to.
It's hard not to be an agnostic.

478
00:22:19,231 --> 00:22:19,471
So,
uh,

479
00:22:19,471 --> 00:22:21,000
yeah,
so I'm agnostic,

480
00:22:21,001 --> 00:22:21,834
but I'm also Jewish and so there's,
it's all part of the kind of 

481
00:22:24,691 --> 00:22:26,670
questioning,
lack of certainty and so forth.

482
00:22:27,900 --> 00:22:28,733
So I think that there is,
there's enough reason to think that we 

483
00:22:32,161 --> 00:22:32,994
have objective morality,
even if you're not certain about the 

484
00:22:34,681 --> 00:22:36,440
existence of God.
Um,

485
00:22:36,930 --> 00:22:37,763
that yeah,
we shouldn't worry that morality is 

486
00:22:39,391 --> 00:22:42,990
going to collapse if people become 
atheist and agnostic.

487
00:22:43,020 --> 00:22:43,853
Right?
Because when I've had this discussion 

488
00:22:44,551 --> 00:22:46,290
usually with conservatives,
you know,

489
00:22:46,291 --> 00:22:47,250
they love to say,
well,

490
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:49,620
God gave us morality.
You know what I mean?

491
00:22:49,621 --> 00:22:50,454
Your rights come from God.
And for me it's like I think you have 

492
00:22:53,580 --> 00:22:56,820
whether they're God,
God given rights or it's your right,

493
00:22:56,970 --> 00:23:00,450
freedom is your right as a human being 
or as optimist prime said,

494
00:23:00,810 --> 00:23:03,210
freedom is the right of all sentient 
beings.

495
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:03,871
You don't.
You're like,

496
00:23:03,871 --> 00:23:05,970
I think you are born free.
I just think that's a,

497
00:23:06,150 --> 00:23:08,220
that's a humanistic approach or your 
boyfriend.

498
00:23:08,221 --> 00:23:11,310
The government can take away your 
freedom but he doesn't give it to you.

499
00:23:11,610 --> 00:23:12,443
And I think that's just a really 
interesting place to go for all these 

500
00:23:14,581 --> 00:23:15,510
political discussions.

501
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:17,033
So I,
that's why I think that there are right 

502
00:23:18,251 --> 00:23:19,084
and wrong ways to treat other human 
beings that are just true independently 

503
00:23:22,151 --> 00:23:22,984
of whether or not the state happens to 
respect them and as soon as the kind of 

504
00:23:26,321 --> 00:23:28,690
enlightenment thought.
So John Locke's I'd look in the state of

505
00:23:28,691 --> 00:23:29,524
nature,
I would be wrong to kill you or assault 

506
00:23:32,231 --> 00:23:33,064
you or steal your property.
This is just the wrong way to treat 

507
00:23:35,291 --> 00:23:36,124
human beings.
It doesn't really have anything to do 

508
00:23:37,001 --> 00:23:37,834
with the state.
Now he might want the state to come in 

509
00:23:39,881 --> 00:23:42,250
and protect those rights,
enforce those rights and so on.

510
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:43,233
But the rates themselves,
the standard of the right and wrong way 

511
00:23:45,531 --> 00:23:48,020
to treat other people does not itself 
come from the state or.

512
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:48,993
So before we get into some of your 
specific arguments that you make on 

513
00:23:51,501 --> 00:23:55,250
economics and a bunch budget,
how do you think are our founders got so

514
00:23:55,251 --> 00:23:56,360
much of this stuff right?

515
00:23:56,420 --> 00:23:58,580
If I'm going on the assumption you 
believe they did,

516
00:23:58,940 --> 00:23:59,773
but I mean every time I go to DC and I 
go to the monuments and I read all of 

517
00:24:02,991 --> 00:24:05,660
this stuff and I just was in philly 
yesterday,

518
00:24:05,661 --> 00:24:06,494
I mentioned to you and I have now a copy
of that little copy Republican senator 

519
00:24:09,801 --> 00:24:12,370
of the declaration and the Declaration 
of independence.

520
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:15,050
The alarm at the,
there was this thing,

521
00:24:15,250 --> 00:24:17,720
it would set off the TSA alarms at the.
Oh,

522
00:24:17,721 --> 00:24:20,480
this one's just standard simple paper,
whatever.

523
00:24:20,540 --> 00:24:22,220
It's probably will set off some alarm 
somewhere.

524
00:24:22,221 --> 00:24:24,980
I'm sure if I go to San Francisco or 
something,

525
00:24:24,981 --> 00:24:26,840
I'm sure a constitution would set off an
alarm.

526
00:24:26,841 --> 00:24:27,674
But,
um,

527
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:29,153
uh,
I assume you think that they got a much 

528
00:24:30,861 --> 00:24:33,650
of this stuff correctly.
How do you think they did it?

529
00:24:33,890 --> 00:24:35,310
Yeah,
so I think that,

530
00:24:36,220 --> 00:24:37,850
I don't know.
So I think that some of it,

531
00:24:37,851 --> 00:24:38,684
and this is a bit outside of my area,
but I think that a lot of them were 

532
00:24:40,641 --> 00:24:43,520
influenced by the smart philosophers.

533
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:44,940
People like.
So I think the law,

534
00:24:45,050 --> 00:24:47,810
the influence of someone like lock on a 
constitution,

535
00:24:47,811 --> 00:24:48,644
it's pretty evident the influence of 
somebody like David Hume on people like 

536
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:54,500
Madison.
I think that's,

537
00:24:54,501 --> 00:24:56,450
I think that maybe that's a matter of 
controversy in history,

538
00:24:56,451 --> 00:24:58,220
but I think there's some evidence to 
suggest that.

539
00:24:58,610 --> 00:25:01,610
So I think that they were students of 
history,

540
00:25:01,611 --> 00:25:03,620
students of philosophy,
students of economics,

541
00:25:03,621 --> 00:25:05,660
and this helped them get a lot right.
And I think,

542
00:25:05,850 --> 00:25:06,683
you know,
obviously I think there were mistakes 

543
00:25:07,251 --> 00:25:09,830
and the way that they applied it and um,
you know,

544
00:25:09,860 --> 00:25:11,150
the way that,
uh,

545
00:25:11,220 --> 00:25:15,410
like Jefferson's a omission of mentions 
of slavery and things like that.

546
00:25:15,411 --> 00:25:17,510
But I think in terms of like the 
fundamentals,

547
00:25:17,930 --> 00:25:22,930
a lot of that was informed by really 
smart philosophers and economists.

548
00:25:24,070 --> 00:25:24,680
Well,
they were,

549
00:25:24,680 --> 00:25:28,500
they were all philosophers in their own 
right and they were inconsistent as,

550
00:25:28,610 --> 00:25:32,420
as people in their own time,
which is why I'm so fascinated with that

551
00:25:32,421 --> 00:25:33,140
period of history.

552
00:25:33,140 --> 00:25:33,973
All right,
so let's talk about some of the 

553
00:25:34,881 --> 00:25:37,490
specifics here.
So I wanted to go to one that I think we

554
00:25:37,491 --> 00:25:39,020
disagree on,
but I want you to,

555
00:25:39,050 --> 00:25:41,750
I want you to make the most compelling 
case that you can,

556
00:25:42,050 --> 00:25:43,490
uh,
this open border stuff.

557
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:44,353
Yes.
So you're not,

558
00:25:44,360 --> 00:25:46,850
you're not a,
I'm not an open borders guy.

559
00:25:46,851 --> 00:25:47,684
This is a,
I'm not a crazy borders person or 

560
00:25:51,081 --> 00:25:52,070
whatever that means.
I don't,

561
00:25:52,071 --> 00:25:52,904
I don't think.
I don't think there should be no 

562
00:25:53,481 --> 00:25:55,310
immigration.
We are a nation of immigrants.

563
00:25:55,790 --> 00:25:56,623
That's what's made this melting pot,
I think the greatest nation in the 

564
00:25:58,251 --> 00:26:00,730
history of the world that's given more 
freedom to more people than,

565
00:26:00,780 --> 00:26:03,080
than anyone ever.
Um,

566
00:26:03,110 --> 00:26:06,710
but the open border situation,
especially now in 2018,

567
00:26:07,100 --> 00:26:10,610
2018 strikes me as particularly tenuous,
but take it away.

568
00:26:11,220 --> 00:26:12,053
So I,
I think one thing to keep in mind is 

569
00:26:13,251 --> 00:26:14,084
what exactly a,
an advocate of open borders is arguing 

570
00:26:17,541 --> 00:26:18,080
for.

571
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:21,410
So I think most so open borders is maybe
a bit of a misnomer.

572
00:26:21,740 --> 00:26:25,490
It's more light borders are porous 
borders or something like that.

573
00:26:25,491 --> 00:26:26,324
Where.
So the idea wouldn't be that there's 

574
00:26:26,870 --> 00:26:30,980
perhaps no checkpoints are no 
restrictions on immigration.

575
00:26:30,981 --> 00:26:31,814
Just very few.
So I think most open border folks would 

576
00:26:33,701 --> 00:26:36,710
be happy saying that if you are a 
wanted,

577
00:26:36,711 --> 00:26:37,544
violent criminal that might exclude you 
from immigrating if you have some 

578
00:26:40,971 --> 00:26:43,620
particularly deadly contagious disease 
and so forth.

579
00:26:43,830 --> 00:26:46,650
But other than that,
a sort of ordinary,

580
00:26:46,651 --> 00:26:49,560
peaceful migrants should be able to come
to the United States.

581
00:26:49,770 --> 00:26:51,150
As far as the,
the argument goes,

582
00:26:51,151 --> 00:26:54,260
I think they're really two strands.
One is just that the,

583
00:26:54,270 --> 00:26:57,390
the economic benefits of immigration are
huge.

584
00:26:57,510 --> 00:26:58,343
So the most optimistic estimates say 
that we could potentially double world 

585
00:27:01,450 --> 00:27:02,283
of GDP by opening borders.
So we've done a pretty good job of 

586
00:27:05,130 --> 00:27:06,210
opening up trade.

587
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:08,280
We've done a much worse job opening up 
borders,

588
00:27:08,430 --> 00:27:09,263
but in terms of the productivity gains 
that it would be incredible better than 

589
00:27:11,551 --> 00:27:13,310
anything else.
We could do a.

590
00:27:13,480 --> 00:27:14,313
and this goes back to what I was 
discussing earlier with our obligations 

591
00:27:16,861 --> 00:27:17,694
to the global poor.
Foreign aid doesn't have a good track 

592
00:27:19,381 --> 00:27:20,214
record.
Military intervention doesn't have a 

593
00:27:21,091 --> 00:27:21,924
good track record,
but allowing people to move from places 

594
00:27:25,050 --> 00:27:25,883
with lower wages to higher wages is by 
far the best antipoverty tool that we 

595
00:27:29,551 --> 00:27:30,384
have.
So if we were going to get into the 

596
00:27:31,530 --> 00:27:32,363
nitty gritty number that,
what do you actually have to do then to 

597
00:27:34,591 --> 00:27:36,630
secure the borders,
right?

598
00:27:36,631 --> 00:27:37,710
Because that's really what this is 
about.

599
00:27:37,711 --> 00:27:40,830
So even if you make every economic 
argument that I'm like,

600
00:27:40,831 --> 00:27:42,930
all right,
I can't riddled my way out of that,

601
00:27:43,220 --> 00:27:45,780
right?
Like if I'm on board that you still have

602
00:27:45,781 --> 00:27:48,840
to do something to make sure that you're
doing those things,

603
00:27:48,841 --> 00:27:51,090
making sure that murderers are coming in
and all of that.

604
00:27:51,090 --> 00:27:51,923
And we don't seem very good at that.
And I think maybe that's the leap that 

605
00:27:54,811 --> 00:27:58,980
gets me to where I can't make the 
secondary part that you're talking about

606
00:27:58,981 --> 00:27:59,731
here.
Yeah.

607
00:27:59,731 --> 00:28:01,780
So I'm not sure about the policy.
I mean,

608
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:04,680
something like the old Ellis island 
system seems pretty good.

609
00:28:04,681 --> 00:28:07,350
I mean,
we had a ton of immigration,

610
00:28:07,650 --> 00:28:08,850
um,
back then,

611
00:28:08,851 --> 00:28:13,590
but there still was some kind of a 
checking mechanism.

612
00:28:13,710 --> 00:28:16,950
So as far so I doubt that that involves 
building a wall,

613
00:28:17,250 --> 00:28:18,083
um,
but having some kind of centralized 

614
00:28:20,821 --> 00:28:21,654
location where immigrants can come and 
get documents and things like that 

615
00:28:23,701 --> 00:28:25,290
seems,
seems pretty reasonable.

616
00:28:25,420 --> 00:28:26,253
Uh,
but that's probably the most detail I 

617
00:28:27,721 --> 00:28:28,554
could give you on policy ideas.
So then when you go over these borders 

618
00:28:31,771 --> 00:28:32,604
then your gut,
you would want these people to be 

619
00:28:33,361 --> 00:28:36,150
governed by the laws of the place that 
they were in,

620
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:36,990
right?

621
00:28:36,990 --> 00:28:37,770
That's right,
yeah.

622
00:28:37,770 --> 00:28:38,380
Yeah.
So,

623
00:28:38,380 --> 00:28:41,970
so I would be happy to write a,
an allow ordinary,

624
00:28:41,971 --> 00:28:45,570
peaceful migrants to come in and then 
apply for US citizenship.

625
00:28:45,571 --> 00:28:46,404
Just,
you know,

626
00:28:46,500 --> 00:28:49,140
uh,
make it pretty easy to do that.

627
00:28:49,380 --> 00:28:50,213
Is this though a tough one for a guy 
that doesn't trust the government that 

628
00:28:52,351 --> 00:28:53,184
much?
Because that's what's ringing with me 

629
00:28:54,451 --> 00:28:55,740
here.
And when I've heard this argument,

630
00:28:55,741 --> 00:28:56,940
it's like,
alright wait,

631
00:28:56,970 --> 00:28:57,803
if you don't trust the government,
well then why do you think the 

632
00:28:59,281 --> 00:29:01,680
government would be able to vet people 
properly?

633
00:29:01,830 --> 00:29:02,663
Especially because we now see what's 
going on in Europe where they've vetted 

634
00:29:05,581 --> 00:29:08,490
people very poorly and have had very 
poorest borders.

635
00:29:08,910 --> 00:29:10,320
So this might.
Yeah.

636
00:29:10,321 --> 00:29:11,760
So I don't know.
I think though,

637
00:29:11,761 --> 00:29:12,594
if you're a skeptic of the government,
so presumably you're a free trade 

638
00:29:15,001 --> 00:29:16,650
advocate,
you like jed across borders.

639
00:29:16,900 --> 00:29:17,733
You wouldn't be happy with governments 
micromanaging trade across borders 

640
00:29:22,321 --> 00:29:25,170
because you're a skeptic about how well 
the government works as am I,

641
00:29:25,410 --> 00:29:26,790
and for the same sorts of reasons.

642
00:29:26,790 --> 00:29:27,623
I'm skeptical.
So I think if you're worried about the 

643
00:29:29,011 --> 00:29:32,070
government working well,
that's all the more reason to get it out

644
00:29:32,130 --> 00:29:35,580
of the immigration regulation business.
So it might,

645
00:29:36,030 --> 00:29:39,660
I think you're probably right.
It does a bad job of a lot of stuff.

646
00:29:39,661 --> 00:29:41,170
Almost everything.
Um,

647
00:29:41,350 --> 00:29:43,900
so the standard here is not going to be 
perfection,

648
00:29:43,901 --> 00:29:48,040
but just what's the best alternative,
heavily regulated immigration or lightly

649
00:29:48,041 --> 00:29:51,520
immigrated regulation.
And I think all things equal lightly,

650
00:29:51,730 --> 00:29:54,340
lightly regulated immigration will 
probably be better.

651
00:29:54,790 --> 00:29:55,623
Let me give you another argument too.
So this again is maybe a more 

652
00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:01,480
libertarian classical liberal argument 
for immigration,

653
00:30:01,630 --> 00:30:05,280
but it just seems like people have a 
right to,

654
00:30:05,370 --> 00:30:07,390
to move across borders.
So for example,

655
00:30:07,720 --> 00:30:09,200
if,
uh,

656
00:30:09,290 --> 00:30:12,640
you know,
I dunno a this table for example,

657
00:30:12,700 --> 00:30:15,430
we're divided by some kind of border and
I said,

658
00:30:15,431 --> 00:30:16,264
well look,
I want you to come over to my side and 

659
00:30:19,060 --> 00:30:19,893
rent my house from me or work in my 
business or join my religious 

660
00:30:22,601 --> 00:30:23,470
congregation.

661
00:30:23,650 --> 00:30:25,150
And you said,
okay,

662
00:30:25,210 --> 00:30:27,700
I do want to do those things.
And we both agree on this.

663
00:30:27,701 --> 00:30:29,050
We,
we agree on the terms.

664
00:30:29,230 --> 00:30:32,710
And then the state sort of intervenes as
a third party in this,

665
00:30:33,310 --> 00:30:34,143
what this philosopher Robert nozick 
would call a capitalist act between 

666
00:30:36,611 --> 00:30:39,790
consenting adults.
It seems like they wouldn't be violating

667
00:30:39,820 --> 00:30:43,570
our rights to associate with one another
on free terms.

668
00:30:43,571 --> 00:30:44,404
And so I think there's a reason to think
that a border controls violate people's 

669
00:30:48,280 --> 00:30:49,113
natural rights.
Is there also some inherent problem 

670
00:30:51,371 --> 00:30:52,204
though that let's say most of the 
Western society is the freest society's 

671
00:30:56,680 --> 00:30:57,513
got onboard.
This will then they would end up being 

672
00:31:00,371 --> 00:31:03,580
flooded with people where maybe the 
economics don't work out.

673
00:31:03,910 --> 00:31:06,300
Because if we just say,
I mean if you think about it,

674
00:31:06,310 --> 00:31:08,320
like if tomorrow we were just like,
all right,

675
00:31:08,321 --> 00:31:09,154
everybody can come.
And just as long as you're not a 

676
00:31:10,301 --> 00:31:13,390
murderer or be a drug dealer,
you're good to go.

677
00:31:13,690 --> 00:31:14,523
That there must be so mechanistic theory
here where we're going to lead in a 

678
00:31:16,991 --> 00:31:17,824
certain amount of people at your 
economics are gonna work out and then 

679
00:31:19,061 --> 00:31:19,894
we're going to get to some odd tipping 
point where because freedom is pretty 

680
00:31:22,781 --> 00:31:24,370
good,
people are gonna want in on it.

681
00:31:24,430 --> 00:31:25,263
Yeah.
So I think there are a couple of things 

682
00:31:26,171 --> 00:31:27,970
to say.
So one is just if we.

683
00:31:27,971 --> 00:31:30,670
I think that problem to some extent 
would be self correcting.

684
00:31:30,850 --> 00:31:34,090
So if you think that a lot of the 
pressure to migrate is economics.

685
00:31:34,091 --> 00:31:36,910
So people are moving from low wage 
countries to higher wage countries.

686
00:31:37,190 --> 00:31:39,550
Those you have more and more people 
enter the high wage,

687
00:31:39,790 --> 00:31:40,623
high wage countries.
This would increase the total number of 

688
00:31:42,341 --> 00:31:45,100
workers which would probably start 
dropping down their wages.

689
00:31:45,310 --> 00:31:48,160
And so you would probably see less 
motivation to move.

690
00:31:48,161 --> 00:31:49,900
I think that's one thing,
but as a,

691
00:31:49,990 --> 00:31:53,620
as a concession to this word,
what I would say is we can do it slowly.

692
00:31:53,800 --> 00:31:54,633
So for example,
if we're really worried about these 

693
00:31:57,340 --> 00:32:00,640
affects of dramatically increasing 
immigration overnight,

694
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:01,713
what we could do is just say increase,
say the limits on immigration by 10 

695
00:32:06,311 --> 00:32:07,870
percent every year or something like 
that,

696
00:32:07,940 --> 00:32:09,820
and take it slowly and see where it 
goes.

697
00:32:09,821 --> 00:32:10,654
But it wouldn't have to push the button.
Open the borders overnight if we have 

698
00:32:13,361 --> 00:32:14,194
this worry.
What do you think is philosophically 

699
00:32:16,091 --> 00:32:18,370
the,
the soundest way to deal with the people

700
00:32:18,371 --> 00:32:20,290
that are already here?
Uh,

701
00:32:20,291 --> 00:32:20,951
I,
yeah,

702
00:32:20,951 --> 00:32:21,784
so I am an advocate of the view that you
don't have an obligation to obey unjust 

703
00:32:26,081 --> 00:32:28,570
laws.
And so I think that our immigration laws

704
00:32:28,571 --> 00:32:30,790
are unjust.
So I think people who came here,

705
00:32:31,080 --> 00:32:33,730
uh,
even against current immigration law,

706
00:32:33,731 --> 00:32:37,090
I think they should just amnesty full 
citizenship.

707
00:32:37,690 --> 00:32:39,800
That's,
that would be my approach to that,

708
00:32:39,920 --> 00:32:40,753
Huh?
Yeah.

709
00:32:40,860 --> 00:32:42,020
All right.
We're not quite there,

710
00:32:42,350 --> 00:32:43,230
but it's all good.

711
00:32:44,990 --> 00:32:48,050
Let me ask you this.
So you're not a fan of the drug war?

712
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:48,820
No,
I'm not.

713
00:32:48,820 --> 00:32:49,653
Okay.
So suppose we have somebody who is in 

714
00:32:52,251 --> 00:32:54,320
jail for selling marijuana.
It's like this,

715
00:32:54,520 --> 00:32:57,410
um,
and then suppose that.

716
00:32:57,850 --> 00:33:00,070
Yeah.
So they're breaking was a citizen of the

717
00:33:00,070 --> 00:33:02,360
United States citizens,
but who broke say current immigration,

718
00:33:02,530 --> 00:33:04,250
not immigration,
current drug laws.

719
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:05,713
Do you think that they violated some 
moral obligation that they had a not to 

720
00:33:10,220 --> 00:33:13,010
break us drug or do you say,
well what good is it bad law?

721
00:33:13,011 --> 00:33:14,390
So they didn't do anything?
Well,

722
00:33:14,600 --> 00:33:16,520
partly I think it would depend on the 
specific offense.

723
00:33:16,521 --> 00:33:17,354
So we're.
So whether they were using drugs or 

724
00:33:18,411 --> 00:33:20,060
selling drugs,
I would see a distinction there.

725
00:33:20,061 --> 00:33:20,894
So if there's someone that.
And there are people that are in jail 

726
00:33:22,611 --> 00:33:26,910
for using drugs right now for using pot,
I think those,

727
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:27,793
those laws are unjust and I would want 
to do everything I could to reverse 

728
00:33:30,261 --> 00:33:33,950
those laws and reversed the,
the prison system,

729
00:33:33,951 --> 00:33:35,090
the justice system and all that.

730
00:33:35,090 --> 00:33:38,430
As far as the dealers,
yeah,

731
00:33:38,440 --> 00:33:39,273
you can't until until we fix these laws 
and figuring out what actually is fair 

732
00:33:42,441 --> 00:33:45,590
and change some classifications on 
marijuana and a bunch of other things.

733
00:33:46,100 --> 00:33:48,020
It's tough.
I think it's tough.

734
00:33:48,021 --> 00:33:50,220
I don't think you can free drug dealers 
per se.

735
00:33:51,170 --> 00:33:52,003
Even though you're a guy,
you don't think they did something that 

736
00:33:53,061 --> 00:33:55,880
should be against the law,
the people that are doing the drugs,

737
00:33:55,881 --> 00:33:59,420
I think you have a right to do with your
body as you see fit.

738
00:33:59,690 --> 00:34:00,380
But again,
but again,

739
00:34:00,380 --> 00:34:01,213
if you break a law you have to like,
I would change the laws is what I'm 

740
00:34:03,771 --> 00:34:04,604
saying,
but if you break a law then you have to 

741
00:34:07,280 --> 00:34:10,460
suffer the consequences of that.
So does that all work out?

742
00:34:11,110 --> 00:34:11,901
I'm curious,
I don't know.

743
00:34:11,901 --> 00:34:13,760
Forgive me for this,
but.

744
00:34:13,761 --> 00:34:17,070
So suppose you have a drug user who's 
convicted of this offense and they're,

745
00:34:17,080 --> 00:34:17,913
they're in jail,
but suppose they can escape from prison 

746
00:34:20,360 --> 00:34:21,193
harmlessly.

747
00:34:21,410 --> 00:34:22,243
Um,
do you think they would be doing 

748
00:34:23,151 --> 00:34:25,160
something morally wrong by escaping from
prison?

749
00:34:25,660 --> 00:34:26,790
All right,
so this is a good little,

750
00:34:26,840 --> 00:34:29,610
right?
We're doing students,

751
00:34:29,830 --> 00:34:30,590
so students.
No,

752
00:34:30,590 --> 00:34:31,820
this is great.
I mean this is what it's about,

753
00:34:31,821 --> 00:34:32,181
right?
So,

754
00:34:32,181 --> 00:34:34,760
okay.
So let's say someone was smoking weed at

755
00:34:34,761 --> 00:34:36,740
home.
Cops bust in there,

756
00:34:36,741 --> 00:34:37,574
thrown in jail for three years.
It's a year or two and they're going to 

757
00:34:40,581 --> 00:34:44,750
pull the shawshank and get out of there.
Do I think they're morally.

758
00:34:44,780 --> 00:34:45,613
The question is,
do I think they're morally right for 

759
00:34:46,641 --> 00:34:48,290
doing it or can that be morally 
justified?

760
00:34:49,330 --> 00:34:49,991
So.
Right.

761
00:34:49,991 --> 00:34:50,824
So what are we morally criticize them if
they pull the shawshank where they 

762
00:34:54,291 --> 00:34:55,950
escaped to the wall or something like 
that,

763
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:57,640
and they don't harm anyone.
They just,

764
00:34:57,700 --> 00:35:01,430
they just leave because they say I was 
convicted of something that ought not be

765
00:35:01,431 --> 00:35:02,264
a crime,
so I don't owe any morally moral 

766
00:35:04,611 --> 00:35:06,830
allegiance to that law and so I'm just 
going to escape.

767
00:35:06,830 --> 00:35:08,810
Would you hear about this story?
Do you say?

768
00:35:08,840 --> 00:35:11,660
I'd be rooting for that guy.
I wouldn't be rooting for that.

769
00:35:11,690 --> 00:35:12,523
So that's kind of my perspective on 
immigration that I think that it's an 

770
00:35:15,711 --> 00:35:16,544
unjust law and justice people are under 
an obligation to obey the state with 

771
00:35:19,761 --> 00:35:20,960
respect to the drug war.
Yeah.

772
00:35:21,080 --> 00:35:21,913
I don't think people are under an 
obligation to be the state with respect 

773
00:35:23,751 --> 00:35:24,500
to immigration.
Right.

774
00:35:24,500 --> 00:35:25,333
So I guess our sort of disconnecting on 
this is just the unjustness of 

775
00:35:27,770 --> 00:35:30,580
immigration laws versus drug laws.
Right?

776
00:35:30,820 --> 00:35:31,653
Right.
So if you think that the law itself is 

777
00:35:32,631 --> 00:35:36,500
not unjust than my argument won't have 
any kind of grip on you.

778
00:35:36,990 --> 00:35:37,823
Yeah.
I'm not saying our immigration laws are 

779
00:35:39,151 --> 00:35:42,180
just by the way,
I just think that especially now,

780
00:35:42,380 --> 00:35:43,213
uh,
also just because of terrorism and 

781
00:35:44,851 --> 00:35:48,020
people move and just when you see what's
going on with Europe and,

782
00:35:48,021 --> 00:35:48,854
and because it hasn't just been a people
trying to get over for humanitarian 

783
00:35:53,821 --> 00:35:54,654
purposes there we know that there's a 
lot of migrants and all sorts of other 

784
00:35:57,391 --> 00:36:00,870
people and then assimilation problems 
and then welfare state problems.

785
00:36:00,870 --> 00:36:01,703
Like it just seems like it's become this
massive thing that most of Europe would 

786
00:36:04,531 --> 00:36:08,520
probably do it very differently if they 
could look back eight years ago.

787
00:36:08,521 --> 00:36:09,480
Right?
Yeah.

788
00:36:09,481 --> 00:36:11,430
So as far as the terrorism point goes,
I mean,

789
00:36:11,431 --> 00:36:14,530
I think if somebody is a one to 
terrorist or a suspected terrorist,

790
00:36:14,531 --> 00:36:16,620
that's a perfectly legitimate reason not
to,

791
00:36:16,650 --> 00:36:20,000
not to allow them in a.
and I'm less concerned about the,

792
00:36:20,170 --> 00:36:23,280
the assimilation concern,
the welfare state concern.

793
00:36:23,490 --> 00:36:25,890
So as far as the,
the assimilation where he goes,

794
00:36:25,891 --> 00:36:28,890
I mean,
a lot of the evidence I've seen suggests

795
00:36:28,891 --> 00:36:29,724
that the political values of immigrants 
and especially second generation 

796
00:36:32,401 --> 00:36:36,090
American immigrants is almost identical 
to the political,

797
00:36:36,150 --> 00:36:40,080
a political values held by a native born
Americans.

798
00:36:40,500 --> 00:36:41,333
Um,
and as far as the welfare state concern 

799
00:36:42,991 --> 00:36:44,130
goes,
um,

800
00:36:44,190 --> 00:36:45,023
I would say we have lots of other 
freedoms that can potentially increase 

801
00:36:48,481 --> 00:36:49,890
the cost of the welfare state.

802
00:36:50,190 --> 00:36:51,900
And we're okay with people exercising 
them.

803
00:36:51,901 --> 00:36:53,520
So for example,
uh,

804
00:36:53,550 --> 00:36:54,390
you know,
I dunno,

805
00:36:54,660 --> 00:36:56,550
we allow people to choose their own 
profession,

806
00:36:56,551 --> 00:36:57,930
for example,
in the United States.

807
00:36:58,080 --> 00:37:00,000
And so suppose you have a student who 
says,

808
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:03,210
here's what I want to do with my life.
I want to become a philosopher.

809
00:37:03,330 --> 00:37:03,650
He said,
well,

810
00:37:03,650 --> 00:37:06,630
that's a dicey career choice,
not a lot of money in it.

811
00:37:06,930 --> 00:37:07,763
Who knows,
maybe you'll end up on unemployment and 

812
00:37:09,271 --> 00:37:10,104
this will in fact increase the cost of 
the welfare state because now you have 

813
00:37:12,601 --> 00:37:13,434
this person on unemployment because they
chose to become a philosopher with our 

814
00:37:15,931 --> 00:37:17,400
life.
We say,

815
00:37:17,401 --> 00:37:18,410
well,
uh,

816
00:37:18,510 --> 00:37:20,040
we,
we let them do that.

817
00:37:20,041 --> 00:37:23,250
We let them to exercise that freedom,
to choose that occupation,

818
00:37:23,460 --> 00:37:27,300
even knowing that this might increase 
the costs of the welfare state.

819
00:37:27,510 --> 00:37:28,343
And so I think you can make an analogous
argument about immigration if you think 

820
00:37:30,661 --> 00:37:32,700
it's a right and important human 
freedom,

821
00:37:32,940 --> 00:37:33,421
then you say,
well,

822
00:37:33,421 --> 00:37:36,630
this is sort of a price of respecting 
rights and respecting freedom.

823
00:37:36,630 --> 00:37:39,240
They sometimes can impose costs on third
parties.

824
00:37:39,560 --> 00:37:41,190
So if all these people come here,
then what,

825
00:37:41,260 --> 00:37:42,093
what duty does the state have to make 
sure that they don't just get here and 

826
00:37:46,410 --> 00:37:47,243
can't do anything and then then more 
crime comes and drugs and the rest of 

827
00:37:50,851 --> 00:37:51,684
it.
Yeah.

828
00:37:51,750 --> 00:37:53,490
Their responsibility for the state at 
that point.

829
00:37:53,491 --> 00:37:54,324
I'm not sure that the responsibility of 
the state to immigrants is different 

830
00:37:56,521 --> 00:37:59,790
from their responsibility to citizens.
So I think part.

831
00:37:59,791 --> 00:38:00,680
So,
uh,

832
00:38:01,050 --> 00:38:01,883
I mean there's also a question of what 
we would do in the ideal world versus 

833
00:38:04,231 --> 00:38:07,760
the real world to say in the ideal world
of somebody like Milton Friedman,

834
00:38:07,770 --> 00:38:08,603
the welfare state is much smaller and 
maybe you have something like the 

835
00:38:10,591 --> 00:38:13,170
negative income tax.
This isn't the world we live in.

836
00:38:13,171 --> 00:38:16,680
We have over a trillion dollars of 
redistributive spending every year.

837
00:38:16,920 --> 00:38:18,300
I mean I don't.
So,

838
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:19,890
so there are two separate issues.

839
00:38:19,890 --> 00:38:20,723
So one is this imperial claim about 
whether immigrants tend to consume more 

840
00:38:24,481 --> 00:38:25,314
in government services than they pay in 
taxes and it seems like the fiscal 

841
00:38:28,171 --> 00:38:29,004
effect is pretty moderate.
So some estimates say they do in fact 

842
00:38:32,760 --> 00:38:35,180
raise fiscal costs a little bit.
Others?

843
00:38:35,350 --> 00:38:36,183
No.
In fact actually there's a net benefit 

844
00:38:37,361 --> 00:38:38,194
because a lot of a lot of new immigrants
aren't consuming a lot of government 

845
00:38:42,401 --> 00:38:45,460
services and so forth and they're paying
sales tax and things like this,

846
00:38:46,390 --> 00:38:49,180
but I think that again,
this is a concession.

847
00:38:49,181 --> 00:38:50,800
If you really have to worry about the 
welfare state,

848
00:38:50,920 --> 00:38:53,890
we could say,
well maybe this is not my view,

849
00:38:53,891 --> 00:38:54,930
but if,
if,

850
00:38:54,990 --> 00:38:57,670
if this is what it took for me to get 
you over to my side,

851
00:38:57,680 --> 00:38:59,590
I'll give you this.
I'll give you this concession.

852
00:38:59,770 --> 00:39:00,603
We could say something like,
you have a five year waiting period 

853
00:39:03,551 --> 00:39:08,170
before you have access to unemployment 
benefits and whatnot.

854
00:39:08,440 --> 00:39:12,060
I would take that over border closure if
those were the only two options.

855
00:39:12,340 --> 00:39:14,230
It's tough being intellectually honest,
isn't it?

856
00:39:14,260 --> 00:39:15,093
Because you have to,
you have to conceive things every now 

857
00:39:16,721 --> 00:39:17,554
and again,
which you just don't see people doing 

858
00:39:19,241 --> 00:39:21,420
anymore.
So it seems like doubling.

859
00:39:21,450 --> 00:39:22,283
That's just,
this is just a ploy to get you and your 

860
00:39:23,501 --> 00:39:25,480
viewers to Lord on my side.
So yeah,

861
00:39:25,481 --> 00:39:26,314
I don't care so much about the honesty.
Just get people on the open borders 

862
00:39:28,391 --> 00:39:28,931
side.
All right,

863
00:39:28,931 --> 00:39:33,430
so you've argued that inequality of 
income is in the real issue,

864
00:39:33,431 --> 00:39:35,920
but poverty is the real issue,
right?

865
00:39:36,370 --> 00:39:37,870
Let's get into the weeds on that.
Okay,

866
00:39:37,871 --> 00:39:39,700
good.
So sometimes you'll hear,

867
00:39:39,701 --> 00:39:42,520
this is sometimes philosophers,
but oftentimes politicians,

868
00:39:42,760 --> 00:39:47,760
they'll make statements like two percent
of a American earners have 40 percent of

869
00:39:49,240 --> 00:39:50,830
the country's wealth or something like 
that.

870
00:39:51,160 --> 00:39:55,840
And from here we're supposed to infer 
that some injustice has occurred because

871
00:39:55,841 --> 00:39:57,430
there's this,
this large inequality.

872
00:39:57,880 --> 00:39:59,440
And I think,
uh,

873
00:39:59,560 --> 00:40:01,510
I mean there might be an injustice 
there,

874
00:40:01,710 --> 00:40:02,543
uh,
but we can't tell a strictly on the 

875
00:40:03,671 --> 00:40:04,504
basis of the inequality.
So there's a philosopher named Robert 

876
00:40:07,240 --> 00:40:08,073
Nozick who famously said,
what matters isn't so much the income 

877
00:40:10,361 --> 00:40:13,270
distribution that we end up with,
but how we got there.

878
00:40:13,450 --> 00:40:14,283
So if somebody has a huge amount of 
wealth but they got it through theft or 

879
00:40:18,521 --> 00:40:21,550
the God had through lobbying the 
government for special privileges,

880
00:40:21,790 --> 00:40:22,623
this is very bad.
This is something that we shouldn't 

881
00:40:23,471 --> 00:40:24,850
encourage.
On the other hand,

882
00:40:24,851 --> 00:40:25,684
if we have somebody who has a lot of 
wealth because they invented the iphone 

883
00:40:28,661 --> 00:40:29,494
and there are tens,
if not hundreds of millions of people 

884
00:40:31,391 --> 00:40:33,520
who want to buy this,
that's totally fine.

885
00:40:33,670 --> 00:40:37,420
So we can't just look at the pie and how
it's carved up and say whether it's just

886
00:40:37,421 --> 00:40:38,254
or unjust.
We have to see that people make their 

887
00:40:40,331 --> 00:40:44,230
money by making other people better off 
by giving them things that they wanted.

888
00:40:44,410 --> 00:40:46,780
Or did they take it through fraudulent 
means?

889
00:40:46,781 --> 00:40:47,614
Coercive means.
And I think that the talk about 

890
00:40:49,601 --> 00:40:54,190
inequality oftentimes confuses a quality
with poverty.

891
00:40:54,490 --> 00:40:55,323
So is what we're really concerned with 
equalizing income or are we concerned 

892
00:40:58,721 --> 00:40:59,554
about making the poor better off?
And I think it's the latter that we 

893
00:41:01,721 --> 00:41:05,140
really should care about.
So how do we go ahead and do that?

894
00:41:05,800 --> 00:41:06,633
Well,
so opening borders I think is the first 

895
00:41:07,901 --> 00:41:10,090
step in terms of alleviating global 
inequality,

896
00:41:10,150 --> 00:41:10,751
or.
I'm sorry,

897
00:41:10,751 --> 00:41:12,940
global poverty I think is the best thing
that we can do.

898
00:41:13,270 --> 00:41:14,103
I think domestically there are a lot of 
government policies that really do harm 

899
00:41:18,521 --> 00:41:20,920
to,
to the most disadvantaged groups.

900
00:41:21,040 --> 00:41:24,910
So I think opening up school choice 
would be a great idea.

901
00:41:25,060 --> 00:41:25,893
I think.
I think the drug war would be a great 

902
00:41:26,741 --> 00:41:27,574
idea.
I think ending occupational licensing 

903
00:41:29,980 --> 00:41:31,450
would be a very good idea.

904
00:41:31,450 --> 00:41:32,283
So enabling people to work in certain 
industries or start their own business 

905
00:41:36,320 --> 00:41:38,160
with a lot less red tape is a very good 
idea.

906
00:41:38,161 --> 00:41:40,740
And wouldn't barbers be stabbing people 
that says,

907
00:41:41,230 --> 00:41:43,340
well this is what I say.
There are some states where you have to,

908
00:41:43,720 --> 00:41:45,580
you have to get licensed to shampoo 
people.

909
00:41:46,040 --> 00:41:47,160
But I shampoo my.
I'm,

910
00:41:47,360 --> 00:41:48,193
I'm pulling my hair every morning and 
doing this and I probably shouldn't say 

911
00:41:53,151 --> 00:41:53,984
that.
Yeah,

912
00:41:54,240 --> 00:41:58,220
do I do with myself?
I combed my hair without a license.

913
00:41:58,221 --> 00:42:02,030
And so far the government hasn't come 
after me and I haven't poked my eye on.

914
00:42:02,050 --> 00:42:02,930
Yeah.
So what's your,

915
00:42:03,270 --> 00:42:06,320
what's your best argument then when the 
people that don't buy into this and say,

916
00:42:06,321 --> 00:42:07,154
well we need these regulations because 
you're going to have people that don't 

917
00:42:10,221 --> 00:42:14,270
know how to dye hair are going to be 
scalding people's heads and you know,

918
00:42:14,810 --> 00:42:18,230
Mr Burns is going to be dumping nuclear 
waste into the Springfield river and all

919
00:42:18,231 --> 00:42:19,010
of those things.

920
00:42:19,010 --> 00:42:19,843
What's the best argument against them?
So one argument is just that I don't 

921
00:42:21,741 --> 00:42:24,300
think regulation works very well and I 
don't think so.

922
00:42:24,480 --> 00:42:28,100
I think the way that the public views 
regulation is probably misguided.

923
00:42:28,340 --> 00:42:31,160
So I don't think the regulators are bad 
people,

924
00:42:31,310 --> 00:42:32,143
but I think if you examine the ways that
regulations are formed and operate in 

925
00:42:36,201 --> 00:42:38,330
the real world,
it's oftentimes to protect the,

926
00:42:38,520 --> 00:42:40,940
the interest of the industries that 
they're regulating.

927
00:42:41,150 --> 00:42:43,160
So this is what's known as regulatory 
capture,

928
00:42:43,370 --> 00:42:44,203
where regulators aren't always looking 
out for the public interest or actually 

929
00:42:46,880 --> 00:42:50,060
looking out for the interests of people 
in that industry.

930
00:42:50,180 --> 00:42:52,490
So financial regulation is a case of 
this.

931
00:42:52,670 --> 00:42:56,000
You have lobbyists who might be friends 
with people in the financial sector,

932
00:42:56,150 --> 00:42:59,060
they want to work in the financial 
sector later or vice versa.

933
00:42:59,270 --> 00:43:02,320
And so they're often very friendly to 
the very people that they're regulating.

934
00:43:02,620 --> 00:43:04,280
Um,
and as far as you know,

935
00:43:04,281 --> 00:43:05,114
the,
the worry about scolding people and so 

936
00:43:06,561 --> 00:43:07,900
forth.
Um,

937
00:43:08,390 --> 00:43:11,330
I think that competition itself is a 
kind of regulation.

938
00:43:11,331 --> 00:43:13,100
So in the case of,
of school choice,

939
00:43:13,310 --> 00:43:14,143
it's true.
You might have very bad charter schools 

940
00:43:16,461 --> 00:43:18,030
for example,
but again,

941
00:43:18,080 --> 00:43:21,410
the standard here is not perfection.
The standard is what's the alternative.

942
00:43:21,500 --> 00:43:23,330
So we have public schools that are 
terrible,

943
00:43:23,720 --> 00:43:28,280
but charter schools have this advantage 
of enabling people to choose.

944
00:43:28,340 --> 00:43:30,530
So if you go to a charter school that's 
failing,

945
00:43:30,560 --> 00:43:32,870
you can pull your kids out and put them 
somewhere else.

946
00:43:32,960 --> 00:43:37,040
And that's a kind of regulation in the 
sense that it provides incentives to the

947
00:43:37,041 --> 00:43:37,874
providers to supply good service.
So it's almost like we should rely on 

948
00:43:40,701 --> 00:43:45,701
self regulation or not regulation,
not even self regulation in a sense.

949
00:43:47,121 --> 00:43:48,860
So this is something that comes up when 
I,

950
00:43:48,890 --> 00:43:49,723
when I argue with people,
is they think that I have this view of 

951
00:43:52,940 --> 00:43:54,770
private business,
uh,

952
00:43:54,771 --> 00:43:55,604
as,
as being sort of benevolent where 

953
00:43:57,080 --> 00:43:58,550
they'll just take care of themselves.

954
00:43:58,550 --> 00:43:59,383
I have a sense of the public interest.
I think maybe to some extent that's 

955
00:44:01,281 --> 00:44:02,114
true,
but it's more the kind of Smithian 

956
00:44:03,260 --> 00:44:07,700
insight where if you have providers who 
are competing for my business,

957
00:44:07,760 --> 00:44:11,630
they don't have to care about my welfare
directly or the welfare of my family,

958
00:44:11,750 --> 00:44:12,583
but they might just want my money and 
that itself is an incentive for them to 

959
00:44:15,231 --> 00:44:16,910
provide good,
safe service.

960
00:44:16,911 --> 00:44:19,730
So in a sense it's competition for 
dollars,

961
00:44:19,731 --> 00:44:22,420
competition for customers that acts as 
the regulations.

962
00:44:22,421 --> 00:44:25,650
So I think the market as a whole is self
regulating,

963
00:44:25,720 --> 00:44:26,553
self correcting.
So you're also a universal basic income 

964
00:44:29,630 --> 00:44:30,790
supporter.
Yeah.

965
00:44:30,860 --> 00:44:35,860
Now this is a idea that comes from 
economists on the left.

966
00:44:37,070 --> 00:44:37,903
I've heard some interesting sort of 
libertarian arguments from it from 

967
00:44:41,251 --> 00:44:43,050
people,
but what is your take on?

968
00:44:43,680 --> 00:44:47,190
So this goes back to the idea that it is
important to take care of people who are

969
00:44:47,191 --> 00:44:51,210
in poverty or who might've fallen on 
hard luck and it needs some help getting

970
00:44:51,211 --> 00:44:52,044
back on their feet.

971
00:44:52,370 --> 00:44:53,203
I might.
My short pitch for the universal basic 

972
00:44:54,781 --> 00:44:57,060
income would just be,
suppose you could take,

973
00:44:57,480 --> 00:44:59,040
I forget what the number is,
but you know,

974
00:44:59,041 --> 00:44:59,874
over a trillion dollars of 
redistributive spending that the United 

975
00:45:02,820 --> 00:45:05,820
States government does a social 
security,

976
00:45:05,850 --> 00:45:07,200
medicare,
medicaid,

977
00:45:07,260 --> 00:45:08,640
unemployment,
all of these things.

978
00:45:08,790 --> 00:45:09,960
Suppose we said,
okay,

979
00:45:09,961 --> 00:45:10,794
you can remove all that and just get 
some kind of cash payout if you fall 

980
00:45:15,841 --> 00:45:16,674
below a certain level of poverty.
So this is kind of the Milton Friedman 

981
00:45:18,601 --> 00:45:19,434
idea,
a where you get sort of more and more 

982
00:45:21,301 --> 00:45:23,220
money the further below the poverty line
you are.

983
00:45:23,280 --> 00:45:24,113
So you can see the whole apparatus of 
the welfare state with its bureaucracy 

984
00:45:26,911 --> 00:45:30,180
and inefficiency and just replace that 
with a universal basic income.

985
00:45:30,210 --> 00:45:31,043
I make that trade every day of the week.
Do you think that that would 

986
00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:39,150
disincentivize people to actually the 
people that are right above that marker?

987
00:45:39,151 --> 00:45:40,970
I mean,
do you know where you put that Marcus?

988
00:45:41,250 --> 00:45:42,083
So I don't know,
I don't have the specifics of where I 

989
00:45:43,261 --> 00:45:45,210
would put it,
but the idea is that we,

990
00:45:45,300 --> 00:45:46,133
uh,
so the way that a friedman structured 

991
00:45:48,030 --> 00:45:48,863
the idea of the negative income tax is 
that you would still get more total 

992
00:45:53,161 --> 00:45:53,994
income by working and making more money 
so you would see some decrease in the 

993
00:45:57,181 --> 00:45:58,980
cash grants that you get from the 
government,

994
00:45:59,640 --> 00:46:00,473
but it wouldn't be so massive as to 
disincentivize so they would be trend 

995
00:46:03,690 --> 00:46:06,500
but they wouldn't be trimmed so much 
that you have no incentive to,

996
00:46:06,550 --> 00:46:07,383
to go to where do you see that as?
Just like some sort of inconsistency 

997
00:46:10,951 --> 00:46:11,784
with the way that you generally view 
government because you're obviously not 

998
00:46:14,551 --> 00:46:15,384
a big government guy.
And yet this is something that's really 

999
00:46:17,970 --> 00:46:18,803
like I would view this as something that
this is like government should have no 

1000
00:46:21,900 --> 00:46:24,660
place in giving that much to people.

1001
00:46:24,660 --> 00:46:25,493
Like it's kind of shitty.
Like I'd love to figure out better ways 

1002
00:46:27,661 --> 00:46:30,300
to help people who need it the most.
Um,

1003
00:46:30,330 --> 00:46:31,163
but the idea of giving more,
I just don't know that there's evidence 

1004
00:46:33,661 --> 00:46:35,310
that it works.
Yeah.

1005
00:46:35,311 --> 00:46:36,200
So,
so,

1006
00:46:36,330 --> 00:46:37,163
so I think though that if that objection
is successful will also be successful 

1007
00:46:39,601 --> 00:46:40,434
about a,
against something like private charity 

1008
00:46:41,580 --> 00:46:42,413
for example.
So I think there always is this worry 

1009
00:46:44,400 --> 00:46:45,233
that when you give some kind of 
assistance that this will have negative 

1010
00:46:49,561 --> 00:46:52,050
effects on people's incentives to work.
I think that's,

1011
00:46:52,110 --> 00:46:53,910
I think that's probably true to some 
extent,

1012
00:46:54,210 --> 00:46:56,310
but that might just be a cost that we 
have to live with.

1013
00:46:56,490 --> 00:46:57,323
So I think again,
even if you're doing some sort of 

1014
00:46:58,501 --> 00:46:59,334
private charity that might lessen at the
margin people's willingness to go to 

1015
00:47:02,611 --> 00:47:03,444
work,
but I think that trade off is worth it 

1016
00:47:04,621 --> 00:47:06,450
if it means say that,
uh,

1017
00:47:06,540 --> 00:47:11,540
we have people who aren't starving who 
aren't very sick without help,

1018
00:47:12,480 --> 00:47:13,800
but I do.
So again,

1019
00:47:13,801 --> 00:47:16,050
a concession that I will make because I 
think by and large,

1020
00:47:16,051 --> 00:47:20,850
private charity will work much better 
than sort of state bureaucratic charity,

1021
00:47:21,120 --> 00:47:21,960
um,
or,

1022
00:47:21,970 --> 00:47:25,050
or transfer programs,
some philosophical level.

1023
00:47:25,060 --> 00:47:27,330
Doesn't that also make people feel 
better?

1024
00:47:27,600 --> 00:47:30,070
Like the idea that like right now 
government just does

1025
00:47:30,070 --> 00:47:32,410
things and it either does them 
inefficiently or not,

1026
00:47:32,411 --> 00:47:35,560
you don't really know where your money's
going and you kind of just are like,

1027
00:47:35,590 --> 00:47:36,880
you can just easily be like,
yeah,

1028
00:47:36,881 --> 00:47:37,714
I'm for poor people because the 
government's doing it where when you 

1029
00:47:40,901 --> 00:47:41,734
actually go ahead and do things and go 
ahead and volunteer and go ahead and 

1030
00:47:44,411 --> 00:47:45,244
give charity and all that,
that just philosophically for your own 

1031
00:47:48,761 --> 00:47:49,594
goodness and happiness and things that 
we've talked about that that's probably 

1032
00:47:51,821 --> 00:47:52,810
much more rewarding.

1033
00:47:53,050 --> 00:47:54,660
I think so.
Right.

1034
00:47:54,670 --> 00:47:57,370
It's very,
it's very easy and low cost to just cast

1035
00:47:57,371 --> 00:48:01,300
a vote for some policy or politician 
that happens to align with your values.

1036
00:48:01,301 --> 00:48:02,260
That doesn't really,
you know,

1037
00:48:02,261 --> 00:48:04,210
the price of that is very low,
but right.

1038
00:48:04,211 --> 00:48:09,160
Actually say doing some research,
figuring out what causes you support a,

1039
00:48:09,250 --> 00:48:10,810
putting money into those things.
Right.

1040
00:48:10,811 --> 00:48:11,644
I think that's much more gratifying.
I think we should get more and moral 

1041
00:48:13,181 --> 00:48:16,510
credit for doing that than just voting 
for policies that you'd like to.

1042
00:48:16,660 --> 00:48:17,470
Is that sort of thing?

1043
00:48:17,470 --> 00:48:20,260
Basic disconnect between Democrats and 
Republicans in this point.

1044
00:48:20,261 --> 00:48:22,330
Like I view it as sort of Democrats are 
kind of like,

1045
00:48:22,450 --> 00:48:23,283
we'll just do everything for you.
We're going to say all the nice things 

1046
00:48:25,271 --> 00:48:27,800
and do it for you.
And Republicans are just like,

1047
00:48:27,820 --> 00:48:28,610
we're not.
We.

1048
00:48:28,610 --> 00:48:29,443
Well,
they ended up doing it anyway because 

1049
00:48:30,161 --> 00:48:31,300
they had.
Once they're empowered,

1050
00:48:31,310 --> 00:48:32,890
they're always spending the money 
anyway,

1051
00:48:32,891 --> 00:48:35,530
but they seem like the evil guys because
they don't want to do it.

1052
00:48:35,720 --> 00:48:38,350
Then they do it anyway,
but that's what it really comes down to.

1053
00:48:38,351 --> 00:48:39,184
It's like one set of people who were 
saying we're gonna do all the nice 

1054
00:48:40,631 --> 00:48:41,464
things and then doing them even when the
results are a nice and another set who 

1055
00:48:44,201 --> 00:48:45,034
doesn't,
don't say they want to do the nice 

1056
00:48:46,121 --> 00:48:46,954
things,
but then they end up doing it and the 

1057
00:48:47,281 --> 00:48:47,570
result results

1058
00:48:47,570 --> 00:48:48,800
still aren't great.
Well,

1059
00:48:48,810 --> 00:48:49,880
so.
So I'm not sure.

1060
00:48:49,881 --> 00:48:50,714
Although I do remember this book I 
probably a little old by now called who 

1061
00:48:54,531 --> 00:48:56,890
really cares by Arthur Brooks.
Have you ever come across?

1062
00:48:57,210 --> 00:48:59,120
So he's.
I think now he's the president,

1063
00:48:59,350 --> 00:49:00,183
have a right.
And what he did find that there were 

1064
00:49:02,931 --> 00:49:06,410
differences in charitable giving between
Democrats and Republicans are,

1065
00:49:06,620 --> 00:49:10,010
I'm not sure if it was along party lines
or ideological lines more broadly,

1066
00:49:10,370 --> 00:49:11,203
and he did find evidence that 
conservatives tend to give more 

1067
00:49:14,481 --> 00:49:17,360
privately than Democrats.
Uh,

1068
00:49:17,660 --> 00:49:19,490
there might be a variety of explanations
for that.

1069
00:49:19,491 --> 00:49:20,324
So one explanation might just be that 
conservatives tend to be more skeptical 

1070
00:49:23,121 --> 00:49:26,510
of the efficacy of these large scale 
bureaucracies.

1071
00:49:26,511 --> 00:49:29,590
Like how well do they actually work?
I think there's maybe also this,

1072
00:49:29,591 --> 00:49:30,424
this idea that it's the role of 
something like the family or the church 

1073
00:49:33,950 --> 00:49:34,783
or civil society to take care of people 
who are in poverty rather than the 

1074
00:49:37,521 --> 00:49:37,850
states.

1075
00:49:37,850 --> 00:49:38,683
And so maybe that's why you see 
conservatives given more charitable 

1076
00:49:41,241 --> 00:49:44,260
dollars than people on the left.
Alright.

1077
00:49:44,330 --> 00:49:45,163
So I want to finish up with a couple,
a scientific experiment that you've 

1078
00:49:49,400 --> 00:49:50,390
written about.
Oh Wow.

1079
00:49:50,391 --> 00:49:51,224
I got a couple here.
Let's see how sharp you are on the 

1080
00:49:54,260 --> 00:49:54,981
previous work you've done.
All right.

1081
00:49:54,981 --> 00:49:57,660
Talk to me about the Stanford prison 
experiment credit.

1082
00:49:58,190 --> 00:49:59,090
Yeah.
So.

1083
00:49:59,180 --> 00:49:59,871
Oh man,
that's.

1084
00:49:59,871 --> 00:50:00,740
Yeah,
that's gone back.

1085
00:50:00,940 --> 00:50:02,620
Right?
So this was a,

1086
00:50:02,930 --> 00:50:03,763
this was research around here,
I don't just sit down with people and 

1087
00:50:06,051 --> 00:50:06,950
you know,
I think you know,

1088
00:50:06,951 --> 00:50:07,784
my work better than that.
So that was an experiment that was 

1089
00:50:11,001 --> 00:50:11,860
conducted,
I,

1090
00:50:12,050 --> 00:50:15,380
I want to say in the early seventies by 
a Stanford psychologist,

1091
00:50:15,650 --> 00:50:20,650
and he recruited a more or less ordinary
young men to serve in this experiment.

1092
00:50:21,320 --> 00:50:22,153
And uh,
some of the subjects were cast as 

1093
00:50:25,100 --> 00:50:25,933
prisoners in this fake prison and other 
subjects were cast as the prison guards 

1094
00:50:30,381 --> 00:50:31,160
in this experiment.

1095
00:50:31,160 --> 00:50:35,470
And so they were enforcing the prison 
rules and feeding the prisoners and uh,

1096
00:50:35,510 --> 00:50:38,060
having them go to sleep at specified 
times and so forth.

1097
00:50:38,360 --> 00:50:39,193
And to make a long story short,
what he found was that the power given 

1098
00:50:43,731 --> 00:50:44,564
to the students who were the prison 
guards did have this corrupt and effect 

1099
00:50:48,110 --> 00:50:48,943
to this idea that power corrupts and 
absolute power corrupts absolutely seem 

1100
00:50:52,850 --> 00:50:55,430
to be supported by his experiments.
So very quickly,

1101
00:50:55,431 --> 00:50:59,010
I think in a matter of days,
what you found were the guards who are,

1102
00:50:59,240 --> 00:51:00,073
again,
we're drawing from the same demographic 

1103
00:51:01,131 --> 00:51:01,964
pool as the,
as the prisoners were abusing the 

1104
00:51:03,621 --> 00:51:05,660
prisoners,
were mocking them,

1105
00:51:06,050 --> 00:51:06,883
uh,
and he had to cut it short because 

1106
00:51:08,540 --> 00:51:09,373
essentially the wheels came off of this 
experiment and the prisoners got so 

1107
00:51:11,931 --> 00:51:14,180
abuse or the prison guards got so 
abusive.

1108
00:51:14,570 --> 00:51:16,940
And so this I think,
confirms this idea that,

1109
00:51:17,320 --> 00:51:18,153
uh,
you don't have to be a bad person to 

1110
00:51:20,541 --> 00:51:23,630
allow power to have this corrupting 
effect on their behavior.

1111
00:51:24,140 --> 00:51:26,210
There must be plenty of other studies 
proving that,

1112
00:51:26,211 --> 00:51:27,830
right?
Even through just the prison system.

1113
00:51:27,831 --> 00:51:29,570
I mean,
when I feel like every prison movie I've

1114
00:51:29,571 --> 00:51:31,100
ever watched,
orange is the new black.

1115
00:51:31,101 --> 00:51:31,934
I mean,
the people that are in charge of the 

1116
00:51:32,511 --> 00:51:34,800
prisons usually are pretty bad people.
Yeah.

1117
00:51:34,880 --> 00:51:36,020
Yeah.
And like I said,

1118
00:51:36,021 --> 00:51:38,210
they could be perfectly ordinary.
And there's also the,

1119
00:51:38,211 --> 00:51:40,740
the milgram experiments where,
which are kind of the,

1120
00:51:41,070 --> 00:51:41,903
uh,
the classic case of this where you just 

1121
00:51:43,101 --> 00:51:46,910
have people who are in essence willing 
to torture,

1122
00:51:46,911 --> 00:51:47,744
give electric shocks to complete 
strangers because somebody in authority 

1123
00:51:50,480 --> 00:51:51,313
told them to do so.
And the subjects figure out ways to 

1124
00:51:53,841 --> 00:51:57,620
rationalize why these electric shocks 
are justified,

1125
00:51:57,660 --> 00:51:58,493
you know,
the person should have behaved 

1126
00:52:00,260 --> 00:52:02,090
differently and they wouldn't have 
gotten the shocks.

1127
00:52:02,390 --> 00:52:05,750
And what's really frightened about this 
is it does show that ordinary people,

1128
00:52:05,751 --> 00:52:06,590
people like,
uh,

1129
00:52:06,750 --> 00:52:07,583
you know,
you and I could easily see our behavior 

1130
00:52:09,771 --> 00:52:11,720
corrupted given the right sort of 
institution.

1131
00:52:12,050 --> 00:52:15,230
What do you do as a human knowing that,
what do you do to,

1132
00:52:15,250 --> 00:52:16,083
to insulate yourself while.
So one thing I think is to be very 

1133
00:52:18,591 --> 00:52:19,424
skeptical of these sorts of institutions
which give people lots of power over 

1134
00:52:23,511 --> 00:52:24,344
others.
I think that's one of the big picture 

1135
00:52:26,270 --> 00:52:29,900
lessons from these sorts of experiments.
Experiments is just be wary of,

1136
00:52:29,930 --> 00:52:32,660
of giving people power on an individual 
level.

1137
00:52:32,840 --> 00:52:34,910
Knowing about it I think helps a little 
bit,

1138
00:52:35,120 --> 00:52:37,010
but even more than just knowing about 
it.

1139
00:52:37,011 --> 00:52:41,170
I think I'm practicing it so when you 
know that you're in a position,

1140
00:52:41,180 --> 00:52:42,013
say to do something wrong because you 
feel the social pressure to do it on a 

1141
00:52:46,521 --> 00:52:47,354
small level,
I'm just try to resist that impulse and 

1142
00:52:49,581 --> 00:52:50,414
actually do the right thing,
so I don't think it's the sort of thing 

1143
00:52:51,951 --> 00:52:56,120
that you can condition yourself to do 
overnight to resist malevolent authority

1144
00:52:56,121 --> 00:52:58,040
or resist becoming a malevolent 
authority,

1145
00:52:58,280 --> 00:52:59,113
but you could take small steps,
but Kinda it's like practicing an 

1146
00:53:01,801 --> 00:53:02,634
athletic skill or something like that.
You don't try dunking a basketball the 

1147
00:53:04,731 --> 00:53:05,564
first time you pick it up,
but you take these small incremental 

1148
00:53:07,701 --> 00:53:08,534
steps and you'll get better and better.
Hopefully built character traits and 

1149
00:53:12,141 --> 00:53:15,320
then maybe resistant when the situation 
becomes more dire.

1150
00:53:15,530 --> 00:53:18,740
It's interesting because that's sort of 
reminds me of the way that we see virtue

1151
00:53:18,741 --> 00:53:20,900
signaling happening on social media 
these days.

1152
00:53:20,901 --> 00:53:24,140
It's not that we're all deciding we have
this power and we can shock somebody,

1153
00:53:24,380 --> 00:53:25,860
but it's like you find someone

1154
00:53:26,010 --> 00:53:29,580
halfway across the world who says 
something you slightly disagree with.

1155
00:53:29,610 --> 00:53:31,350
Even though you've never heard of them 
before.

1156
00:53:31,560 --> 00:53:34,800
You start seeing the mob go at them and 
the next thing you know,

1157
00:53:34,801 --> 00:53:38,130
you ratchet up more and then someone 
else ratcheted up more and more and it's

1158
00:53:38,131 --> 00:53:40,560
all done in the name of being good 
actually.

1159
00:53:40,561 --> 00:53:42,660
The way you're trying to shame and 
destroyed his person.

1160
00:53:42,700 --> 00:53:43,421
Yeah,
they're in there,

1161
00:53:43,421 --> 00:53:44,254
right?
There's something kind of 

1162
00:53:44,411 --> 00:53:48,340
psychologically gratifying about being 
part of a moralizing mob.

1163
00:53:48,370 --> 00:53:50,980
And I think that's an impulse that does 
have to be resisted.

1164
00:53:50,981 --> 00:53:52,120
Right?
So it's virtue signaling.

1165
00:53:52,121 --> 00:53:54,160
It's not actually,
it's not actually exactly.

1166
00:53:54,340 --> 00:53:56,410
Actual virtue would be saying something 
like,

1167
00:53:56,411 --> 00:53:57,150
well,
I,

1168
00:53:57,150 --> 00:53:57,983
you know,
I think everybody here is wrong about 

1169
00:53:59,411 --> 00:54:02,980
what the right thing to do is here.
That's usually a pretty lonely guy.

1170
00:54:03,310 --> 00:54:04,300
It's true.
That's true.

1171
00:54:04,410 --> 00:54:05,170
All right,
one more.

1172
00:54:05,170 --> 00:54:07,720
Sure.
The asch conformity experiment.

1173
00:54:07,730 --> 00:54:08,563
Yeah.
So that's along the same line as the 

1174
00:54:09,791 --> 00:54:13,150
Stanford prison experiment and the 
milgram experiments in this,

1175
00:54:13,151 --> 00:54:15,220
I think this was the,
one of the originals.

1176
00:54:15,460 --> 00:54:20,460
It was in the 19 fifties and subjects 
were given,

1177
00:54:21,300 --> 00:54:22,133
uh,
a board which had lines of different 

1178
00:54:24,670 --> 00:54:27,460
lengths on them.
So like there was one that was very long

1179
00:54:27,461 --> 00:54:29,140
when it was moderately long,
when it was short,

1180
00:54:29,141 --> 00:54:30,320
for example,
uh,

1181
00:54:30,321 --> 00:54:31,154
and then they were given another line 
that they were told was the same length 

1182
00:54:35,141 --> 00:54:37,660
is one of the lines on the other board 
and it was very obvious.

1183
00:54:37,660 --> 00:54:39,430
So it was like this was a,
like a,

1184
00:54:39,431 --> 00:54:40,264
a very long line over here.
And there was a very long line over 

1185
00:54:42,281 --> 00:54:43,114
here.
They were clearly the same length but 

1186
00:54:44,021 --> 00:54:46,660
they were surrounded by other lines of 
various line.

1187
00:54:46,810 --> 00:54:49,030
But it was just as very easy test until 
they asked subjects.

1188
00:54:49,270 --> 00:54:50,103
Well,
which line over here is the same length 

1189
00:54:51,701 --> 00:54:52,534
as this line over here?
And everybody knew what the correct 

1190
00:54:54,911 --> 00:54:58,620
answer was,
but the twist of the experiment was a.

1191
00:54:58,720 --> 00:54:59,553
The experimenter would bring in 
confederates who would lie and give the 

1192
00:55:02,980 --> 00:55:05,350
obviously false answers.
So they would say,

1193
00:55:05,890 --> 00:55:07,630
oh,
in fact it turns out that the short line

1194
00:55:07,631 --> 00:55:10,360
over here is the same length as this 
long line over here.

1195
00:55:10,450 --> 00:55:15,100
And what they wanted to test was whether
the genuine subject would conform to the

1196
00:55:15,101 --> 00:55:17,620
mistaken group judgment,
which they need to be clearly wrong,

1197
00:55:17,800 --> 00:55:19,390
or would they stick to their guns and 
say,

1198
00:55:19,391 --> 00:55:21,160
no,
everybody in this room is wrong.

1199
00:55:21,550 --> 00:55:22,750
It's clearly,
you know,

1200
00:55:22,751 --> 00:55:24,760
this line here and everybody else made a
mistake.

1201
00:55:25,090 --> 00:55:30,090
And the depressing result is that many 
people would not just conform once,

1202
00:55:30,641 --> 00:55:34,720
but would conform over and over again to
the judgment that they knew was wrong.

1203
00:55:34,960 --> 00:55:35,793
And even people who sometimes broke from
the group would have at least a couple 

1204
00:55:38,771 --> 00:55:40,960
of answers where they conform to the 
group answer.

1205
00:55:40,961 --> 00:55:42,040
So is that just

1206
00:55:42,300 --> 00:55:47,250
sort of basic built in DNA that just 
certain people are going to stand up for

1207
00:55:47,251 --> 00:55:50,130
what they believe in?
What's right and what's true and most of

1208
00:55:50,131 --> 00:55:51,440
us aren't?
Or is that,

1209
00:55:51,880 --> 00:55:56,050
can you.
Can you really like Steven pinker?

1210
00:55:56,800 --> 00:55:57,633
Right?
Well I believe pinker would say 

1211
00:55:59,021 --> 00:56:00,450
something about a blank slate.
Right?

1212
00:56:00,680 --> 00:56:01,690
So.
So I'm not sure.

1213
00:56:01,691 --> 00:56:02,350
Right.
He might.

1214
00:56:02,350 --> 00:56:04,540
He might say it's something close to our
DNA.

1215
00:56:04,750 --> 00:56:07,540
I'm not sure.
It's interesting when you read testimony

1216
00:56:07,541 --> 00:56:08,374
from people in the milgram experiments,
there were some people who just refused 

1217
00:56:11,490 --> 00:56:12,323
to deliver these shocks to people even 
though there was a lot of pressure on 

1218
00:56:14,441 --> 00:56:19,441
them and it seems like some of them had 
life experiences that really discouraged

1219
00:56:20,651 --> 00:56:24,250
them from a obeying the authority and it
wouldn't shock me,

1220
00:56:24,280 --> 00:56:25,113
no pun intended,
if there was something like that going 

1221
00:56:26,441 --> 00:56:27,274
on in these conformity experiments where
maybe people have seen the malevolent 

1222
00:56:30,341 --> 00:56:34,180
effects of blind conformity in this 
motivated them to do it.

1223
00:56:34,510 --> 00:56:35,321
Uh,
so yeah,

1224
00:56:35,321 --> 00:56:37,540
so I'm not sure whether it's nature or 
nurture.

1225
00:56:37,541 --> 00:56:39,220
I don't know.
That's probably above my pay grade.

1226
00:56:40,030 --> 00:56:41,500
All right.
As long as you mentioned pinker,

1227
00:56:41,501 --> 00:56:43,260
this I think will be a good way to wrap 
this all up.

1228
00:56:43,300 --> 00:56:46,270
Are you hopeful as,
as a philosopher,

1229
00:56:46,271 --> 00:56:49,810
are you hopeful for free thought?
I mean,

1230
00:56:49,830 --> 00:56:50,663
a lot of people that care about the 
conversations that we're having are 

1231
00:56:53,771 --> 00:56:54,604
really worried and I find that the 
people that are most closely associated 

1232
00:56:57,431 --> 00:56:59,200
with that I have these conversations 
with most,

1233
00:56:59,500 --> 00:57:02,530
I would say most of us are sort of world
weary optimists.

1234
00:57:02,531 --> 00:57:05,410
That's how I would describe myself,
like if I wasn't hopeful,

1235
00:57:05,411 --> 00:57:06,910
I don't know how the Hell I could do 
this everyday,

1236
00:57:06,940 --> 00:57:09,790
right.
Like I'm hopeful that we can make things

1237
00:57:09,791 --> 00:57:10,624
better and yet at the same time there's 
no doubt we have an uphill battle and 

1238
00:57:13,871 --> 00:57:14,704
that there's so much history all the 
time and all the forces that we're not 

1239
00:57:19,751 --> 00:57:21,430
into seem to be on the march all the 
time.

1240
00:57:21,431 --> 00:57:22,840
But are you hopeful?

1241
00:57:23,030 --> 00:57:25,170
I like that term world where he 
optimists,

1242
00:57:25,171 --> 00:57:26,004
I think that probably describes me 
pretty well and part of the reason I'm 

1243
00:57:28,381 --> 00:57:29,214
optimistic is because oftentimes when I 
think when you're interacting with 

1244
00:57:33,901 --> 00:57:34,734
people on a one on one level,
you're more likely to have a civil 

1245
00:57:38,281 --> 00:57:40,650
productive discussion about 
controversial topics.

1246
00:57:40,651 --> 00:57:41,484
Then when it's like these huge,
like I just gave this talk I think 

1247
00:57:44,941 --> 00:57:45,774
recently at a college and you got my 
brother give me an hour of 

1248
00:57:50,040 --> 00:57:53,870
philosophically not at University of New
Hampshire.

1249
00:57:53,920 --> 00:57:54,210
Oh,
okay.

1250
00:57:54,210 --> 00:57:55,080
Right.
Yeah.

1251
00:57:55,081 --> 00:57:55,914
And so I think in those,
so talking about like virtue signaling 

1252
00:57:57,601 --> 00:57:58,434
and a mob mentality,
I think those sorts of settings are 

1253
00:58:00,751 --> 00:58:01,584
conducive to that.
I think oftentimes when you're just 

1254
00:58:04,261 --> 00:58:05,094
talking with a person over a beer,
you might have completely different 

1255
00:58:08,341 --> 00:58:11,310
politics than they do,
but it's kind of a,

1256
00:58:11,510 --> 00:58:14,520
a nonthreatening sort of friendly 
situation.

1257
00:58:14,850 --> 00:58:15,683
I think people's guards go down a little
bit more and those sorts of situations 

1258
00:58:19,141 --> 00:58:23,460
and you can actually have a conversation
about controversial topics in good faith

1259
00:58:23,880 --> 00:58:25,950
and so that I.
So I think people want that.

1260
00:58:25,951 --> 00:58:26,784
I think people want to have these kinds 
of discussions and arguments and it 

1261
00:58:31,201 --> 00:58:35,970
might be the people who are a least 
friendly to that sort of thing,

1262
00:58:36,600 --> 00:58:38,970
get the most visibility or get the most 
publicity,

1263
00:58:39,150 --> 00:58:42,150
but I think if you took an average 
person off the street and said,

1264
00:58:42,151 --> 00:58:42,984
hey,
let's grab a beer and talk about 

1265
00:58:43,531 --> 00:58:44,364
politics,
it wouldn't be nearly as bad as you 

1266
00:58:47,101 --> 00:58:48,990
know,
doing it in front of 50,000

1267
00:58:48,991 --> 00:58:49,440
people.

1268
00:58:49,440 --> 00:58:50,273
I agree.
And that's why I said the thing about 

1269
00:58:51,091 --> 00:58:53,370
the 80 percent before,
and I think in summation,

1270
00:58:53,371 --> 00:58:57,030
you believe that beer is the great 
philosophical equalizer.

1271
00:58:57,290 --> 00:58:59,760
Maybe Bourbon.
I'm not really at,

1272
00:58:59,870 --> 00:59:02,600
not beer.
You've got this great thing over here.

1273
00:59:02,601 --> 00:59:05,000
So yeah.
So Bourbon is Bourbon whiskey that.

1274
00:59:05,480 --> 00:59:07,970
On that note we should wrap this up and 
see what we can do with the Bourbon.

1275
00:59:08,180 --> 00:59:11,720
Alright for more on Chris Checkout see
