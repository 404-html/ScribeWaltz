1
00:00:04,470 --> 00:00:07,770
Joining me today is the author of the 
orphan x novels,

2
00:00:07,771 --> 00:00:10,200
a comic book writer whose work includes 
Batman,

3
00:00:10,201 --> 00:00:11,700
Wolverine,
and the punisher,

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,540
and a guy trying to save the Democrats.
Gregg Hurwitz.

5
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:17,470
Has It gone?
It's good to see you.

6
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:23,240
That's the scariest one.
You can write all the thriller novels 

7
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:25,701
you want to in gallery.
It's worse than any Batman Villain or 

8
00:00:26,851 --> 00:00:30,060
evil theory I've ever heard.
Trying to save the Democrats,

9
00:00:30,061 --> 00:00:35,061
but you're trying.
We're going to get to that in a little 

10
00:00:35,061 --> 00:00:37,521
bit.
So there's a lot I want to do here with 

11
00:00:37,521 --> 00:00:37,521
you.
Uh,

12
00:00:37,521 --> 00:00:38,010
let's talk or if an experts and a little
bit just about your work.

13
00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:40,800
Um,
what got you into thrillers?

14
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:46,480
You know,
the only thing I ever wanted to do is 

15
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:49,611
write thrillers.
And my parents did not let me watch TV 

16
00:00:49,611 --> 00:00:51,510
when I was growing up in Leicester was 
Alfred Hitchcock movie on or the Red Sox

17
00:00:51,511 --> 00:00:52,620
were on my dad's from Boston.

18
00:00:52,620 --> 00:00:54,440
So that was religion.
Um,

19
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:59,600
and so all that I did was read.
And so I was like climbing the 

20
00:00:59,600 --> 00:00:59,970
bookshelves to get to,
you know,

21
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,240
jaws on the top shelf.
And Stephen King,

22
00:01:03,241 --> 00:01:05,130
I mean I was just into all that stuff 
by,

23
00:01:05,160 --> 00:01:10,160
by fifth grade and I was obsessed with 
it and I still remember reading Salem's 

24
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:12,240
lot,
like under my bed with a flashlight.

25
00:01:12,330 --> 00:01:17,330
I was 25 years old,
but my parents were out and I remember 

26
00:01:17,330 --> 00:01:18,430
just being terrified and just thinking 
it's,

27
00:01:18,630 --> 00:01:23,630
it's insane to me that this guy,
Stephen King can take a combination of 

28
00:01:23,630 --> 00:01:28,460
familiar words and put them together in 
an unfamiliar way and elicit this much 

29
00:01:28,460 --> 00:01:29,310
emotion in me and just the only thing I 
wanted to do.

30
00:01:29,311 --> 00:01:34,311
So I started to write these mysteries 
with like crown illustrations at that 

31
00:01:34,311 --> 00:01:35,820
age.
And I went to college,

32
00:01:36,390 --> 00:01:41,390
studied English and psychology.
That's where I met Jordan because I 

33
00:01:41,390 --> 00:01:41,390
thought that'd be the best combination 
of majors.

34
00:01:41,390 --> 00:01:43,200
And I started my first novel when I went
to Harvard.

35
00:01:43,300 --> 00:01:44,220
I went to Harvard.
Yeah.

36
00:01:44,310 --> 00:01:45,080
Say College.
You could,

37
00:01:45,130 --> 00:01:48,510
you could say that place in Canberra.
Um,

38
00:01:48,750 --> 00:01:53,750
and so basically I started my first book
when I was 19 and then it got supremely 

39
00:01:53,750 --> 00:01:55,750
lucky and sold it,
you know,

40
00:01:56,310 --> 00:01:58,710
and kind of never had to have a real 
job.

41
00:01:58,830 --> 00:01:59,940
Yeah.
Does that,

42
00:01:59,970 --> 00:02:02,820
is that how it feels to you still have a
real job?

43
00:02:02,821 --> 00:02:07,821
Like when I was just looking through 
your wikipedia today and all the cool 

44
00:02:07,821 --> 00:02:07,950
things that you've done and all the 
comic books that I've grown up,

45
00:02:08,150 --> 00:02:13,150
you know,
reading and the characters that 

46
00:02:13,150 --> 00:02:13,150
everybody cares about.
It doesn't.

47
00:02:13,150 --> 00:02:15,930
It doesn't feel real.
I can't believe I get paid to do it.

48
00:02:16,170 --> 00:02:21,170
Like I love it so much.
I sort of wake up and float down the 

49
00:02:21,170 --> 00:02:22,920
hall to my office on a barge of 
gratitude.

50
00:02:22,980 --> 00:02:24,420
I just,
it's so great.

51
00:02:24,421 --> 00:02:29,421
And the comics were a blast.
I mean the comics are like when you get 

52
00:02:29,421 --> 00:02:32,721
into marvel and DC,
it's like that super rich kid who used 

53
00:02:32,721 --> 00:02:35,331
to live up the street from.
You had all the best toys and you could 

54
00:02:35,331 --> 00:02:35,331
go to their house and play with their 
toys.

55
00:02:35,331 --> 00:02:36,520
That's more vul in DC.
It's like,

56
00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:41,540
do you want to.
I still remember my first call for 

57
00:02:41,540 --> 00:02:41,540
marvel.
I'm the editor in chief who's,

58
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:46,640
who's a very good friend.
Axel Alonso was a fan of some of my 

59
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:50,241
books and called and said you can have 
sort of any character from the marvel 

60
00:02:50,241 --> 00:02:50,241
volts.
Oh Man.

61
00:02:50,241 --> 00:02:52,050
And it had to be super calm and cool and
collected,

62
00:02:52,051 --> 00:02:54,010
but my inner geek boy,
he's doing cartwheels.

63
00:02:54,030 --> 00:02:56,130
I mean,
I know you love this stuff and it's like

64
00:02:56,160 --> 00:03:01,160
it's in our cells.
And so I said know I wanted to do the 

65
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:02,350
punisher because the punisher was the 
end all be all.

66
00:03:02,350 --> 00:03:04,690
There's a lot of punisher in orphan acts
too.

67
00:03:04,691 --> 00:03:09,691
I mean you can a lot of Batman,
you can see those and basically I wound 

68
00:03:09,691 --> 00:03:12,460
up writing that they wanted someone from
outside of Comex because garth ennis had

69
00:03:12,461 --> 00:03:17,461
completed his legendary run and they 
wanted to kind of reboot it and I still 

70
00:03:17,461 --> 00:03:19,780
remember I had this totally surreal 
experience where I went to the bookstore

71
00:03:19,781 --> 00:03:21,520
right here on Ventura.
I'm sorry,

72
00:03:21,521 --> 00:03:24,790
the comic book shop and I could no 
longer buy my favorite comment because I

73
00:03:24,791 --> 00:03:29,791
was writing it like I already knew what 
would have happened in it and it was 

74
00:03:29,791 --> 00:03:31,570
completely real comic book in there.
So when I was wild.

75
00:03:31,630 --> 00:03:36,630
Yeah.
So are you more of a marvel guy or a DC 

76
00:03:36,630 --> 00:03:37,150
guy to ask?
I don't know that you legally can answer

77
00:03:37,151 --> 00:03:38,380
that.
You're more marvel.

78
00:03:38,381 --> 00:03:39,230
Yeah.
I'm more of a more.

79
00:03:39,580 --> 00:03:42,130
I am more marvel with the exception of 
Batman.

80
00:03:42,170 --> 00:03:44,960
I mean I love whole spider.
I was hardcore spider man,

81
00:03:44,961 --> 00:03:49,961
like you know,
and I had every punisher appearance 

82
00:03:49,961 --> 00:03:53,430
would make of sort of the way the movies
have gone down because it's so clear 

83
00:03:53,430 --> 00:03:56,560
that marvel has figured out how to do 
these movies correctly and at least from

84
00:03:56,561 --> 00:03:58,710
my opinion,
dc or the wonder woman,

85
00:03:58,740 --> 00:03:59,890
the standalone.
It was good.

86
00:04:00,100 --> 00:04:03,040
Like they just can't quite get right.
Although the,

87
00:04:03,170 --> 00:04:05,860
the original Batman,
the Christian Bale,

88
00:04:05,861 --> 00:04:08,390
Batman's,
where will those Batman's?

89
00:04:09,070 --> 00:04:10,960
So I wrote Batman the dark night,
do you have here?

90
00:04:10,961 --> 00:04:15,961
So my Batman series,
it was very much has an homage to those 

91
00:04:15,961 --> 00:04:17,600
films.
It wasn't the main Batman title,

92
00:04:17,601 --> 00:04:22,601
just Batman was Batman the dark night 
and I was very focused on reinventing 

93
00:04:22,601 --> 00:04:26,701
the villains.
I love villains and I love dealing with 

94
00:04:26,701 --> 00:04:26,890
darkness and giving them a very 
legitimate viewpoint,

95
00:04:27,220 --> 00:04:32,220
which is probably part of the 
perspective shifting that I think that 

96
00:04:32,220 --> 00:04:32,260
I'm capable of doing politics.

97
00:04:32,260 --> 00:04:35,560
I can see a lot of other sides and a lot
of valid reasons for it.

98
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:40,680
Well,
I can also see this is why you can do 

99
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:42,961
some things with Jordan because he 
always talks about you have to give the 

100
00:04:42,961 --> 00:04:43,150
devil his due and I guess you really 
have to do that if you're going to write

101
00:04:43,151 --> 00:04:43,960
a good villain,
right?

102
00:04:43,990 --> 00:04:44,550
No.
Yeah.

103
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:46,420
I mean the bad guy never thinks he's the
bad guy.

104
00:04:46,421 --> 00:04:51,421
Right?
So it's like the more I think younger 

105
00:04:51,421 --> 00:04:51,421
writers and me included,
you know,

106
00:04:51,421 --> 00:04:55,400
my early stuff,
it's like the worst possible serial 

107
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:56,440
killer villain you think that makes your
guy a better force for good.

108
00:04:56,740 --> 00:05:01,740
And what you realize is if you can 
actually build a steel man instead of a 

109
00:05:01,740 --> 00:05:02,320
straw man,
like someone who has a reason,

110
00:05:02,321 --> 00:05:06,310
rationale and worldview that we almost 
start to relate to as a villain,

111
00:05:06,370 --> 00:05:07,690
like it's right there.

112
00:05:08,260 --> 00:05:11,830
And then your guy defeats him even 
through that chaos and ambiguity,

113
00:05:12,150 --> 00:05:14,620
um,
that actually occurs way more positively

114
00:05:14,621 --> 00:05:18,040
to your protagonist than if he's just 
tracking serial killers all day.

115
00:05:18,390 --> 00:05:21,400
Serial killer is inherently aren't that 
interesting from a narrative perspective

116
00:05:21,401 --> 00:05:22,510
because it's like,
why do you do it?

117
00:05:22,540 --> 00:05:23,530
Oh,
he's insane.

118
00:05:24,090 --> 00:05:29,090
You know,
if you can find people with a real 

119
00:05:29,090 --> 00:05:29,090
rationale,
which is what I do for,

120
00:05:29,090 --> 00:05:29,320
it's what I really do in the orphan 
access.

121
00:05:29,321 --> 00:05:31,360
But I did that with penguin,
with scarecrow,

122
00:05:31,361 --> 00:05:31,940
with,
you know,

123
00:05:32,050 --> 00:05:37,050
the mad hatter.
I tried to give them an inner life that 

124
00:05:37,050 --> 00:05:39,571
shows the reflection of Batman.
It's sorta like a buffalo bill.

125
00:05:39,731 --> 00:05:43,150
Wasn't really the interesting bad guy.
Silence of the lambs.

126
00:05:43,270 --> 00:05:44,670
It was Hannibal Lecter,
right?

127
00:05:44,690 --> 00:05:49,690
Like the psychopath.
There were the straight up murdering 

128
00:05:49,690 --> 00:05:49,690
psychopath.
Yeah.

129
00:05:49,690 --> 00:05:54,070
It was more about the intricacies of the
psychological piece.

130
00:05:54,130 --> 00:05:55,990
Well,
and that structured like a love story.

131
00:05:56,050 --> 00:06:01,050
Right?
That's a love story between Hannibal 

132
00:06:01,050 --> 00:06:01,050
Lecter and clarice starling.
Right.

133
00:06:01,050 --> 00:06:02,870
Didn't end that well for well.
Well for them it did.

134
00:06:02,900 --> 00:06:07,900
For them it did.
I didn't end that well for the guy to 

135
00:06:07,900 --> 00:06:10,450
jail.
There's a dance and there was a 

136
00:06:10,450 --> 00:06:10,450
flirtation and so it's very much about 
them,

137
00:06:10,460 --> 00:06:13,490
you know,
it's just very weird,

138
00:06:13,491 --> 00:06:16,640
twisted foray into intimacy between two 
opposite parties.

139
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:19,280
And so it's structured out like a 
romance.

140
00:06:19,370 --> 00:06:22,580
We should recut cut that as a Romcom 
sure.

141
00:06:22,590 --> 00:06:27,590
Somebody,
somebody's done that on youtube 

142
00:06:27,590 --> 00:06:28,931
somewhere.
So for somebody that's interested in 

143
00:06:28,931 --> 00:06:29,210
stories and these archetypal characters,
and as you know,

144
00:06:29,211 --> 00:06:31,130
I'm on tour with Jordan Peterson right 
now.

145
00:06:31,430 --> 00:06:36,430
Um,
how much truth do you think people can 

146
00:06:36,430 --> 00:06:38,210
get out of these stories because Jordan 
is always talking about,

147
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:43,240
you know,
the truth that you can extrapolate from 

148
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:45,161
religious stories,
but then also it does related that you 

149
00:06:45,161 --> 00:06:45,161
can get truth from well written fiction,
like,

150
00:06:45,161 --> 00:06:46,550
you know,
he talks about Harry Potter a lot or the

151
00:06:46,551 --> 00:06:50,360
story of Pinocchio or just different 
things when you're writing these things.

152
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:53,720
Are you really keeping that in mind?
Yeah,

153
00:06:53,721 --> 00:06:55,400
you know,
that's a really interesting question.

154
00:06:55,460 --> 00:06:56,150
I mean,
I,

155
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:59,540
I believe I'm a hardcore young yet.
I mean,

156
00:06:59,541 --> 00:07:01,370
I first studied young under Jordan,
my,

157
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:03,230
my thesis,
if anybody,

158
00:07:03,260 --> 00:07:08,260
like if Ambien doesn't work,
my thesis was 14 and young in analysis 

159
00:07:08,260 --> 00:07:11,060
of shakespearian tragedy.
I mean I pause it that Shakespeare was.

160
00:07:11,150 --> 00:07:12,980
His tragedies are like perfect 
thrillers,

161
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:14,810
right?
They're highly structured,

162
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:20,080
convention bound,
reinterpretations of past themes that 

163
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:23,981
are narratively driven of lust,
intrigue and murder designed to appeal 

164
00:07:23,981 --> 00:07:24,590
to the broadest possible cross section 
of people.

165
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:30,640
But I'm a hardcore young Ian and that I 
do believe that the hero myth is as 

166
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:34,340
essential and evolutionarily selected as
opposable thumbs and eyelids.

167
00:07:34,550 --> 00:07:39,550
Like you can find a tribe cut off from 
all human contact very deep in the 

168
00:07:39,550 --> 00:07:40,970
Amazon and you know they're going to 
have opposable thumbs.

169
00:07:41,030 --> 00:07:46,030
You know,
they're going to have eyelids and you 

170
00:07:46,030 --> 00:07:46,030
know that they're going to have a hero 
myth with all the constituent parts.

171
00:07:46,030 --> 00:07:46,580
So then the question is,
well,

172
00:07:46,581 --> 00:07:49,490
why?
And so what I believe is that,

173
00:07:50,070 --> 00:07:51,170
I mean,
what I believe,

174
00:07:51,171 --> 00:07:52,370
what,
what young believes,

175
00:07:52,371 --> 00:07:57,371
what Jordan talks about a lot is that 
there's essential wisdom that's 

176
00:07:57,371 --> 00:07:58,070
embedded.
That in my mind is more,

177
00:07:58,350 --> 00:08:03,350
is a more real truth.
And the truth is that we deal with on 

178
00:08:03,350 --> 00:08:05,060
the surface and a lot of ways of how to 
contend with the unknown,

179
00:08:05,061 --> 00:08:07,960
both internally and externally.
So you buy in.

180
00:08:07,961 --> 00:08:11,570
If we were looking at the Sorta Sam 
Harris Jordan debate on this,

181
00:08:11,571 --> 00:08:16,571
you buy Jordan's version of that,
that it's beyond just fact that can give

182
00:08:18,081 --> 00:08:23,081
us truth.
It's that there has to be some other 

183
00:08:23,081 --> 00:08:23,990
sort of story on top of that.
Yes.

184
00:08:24,470 --> 00:08:29,470
I think we're story processing and story
making machines that you can't get value

185
00:08:30,020 --> 00:08:32,270
out of just fact alone basically.

186
00:08:32,450 --> 00:08:33,630
Yeah.
I mean you need to.

187
00:08:34,010 --> 00:08:36,680
You need to embed something in some 
archetypal structure.

188
00:08:37,040 --> 00:08:39,950
So I always think of it like we're 
preconditioned to have.

189
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:45,280
And you know,
it's complicated because people think 

190
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:47,420
when you talk about the end collective 
unconscious people think that like 

191
00:08:47,420 --> 00:08:50,501
somewhere floating in our prefrontal 
cortex is the notion of a whiz into old 

192
00:08:50,501 --> 00:08:53,480
woman as representing wisdom.
But I don't think it's that.

193
00:08:53,481 --> 00:08:57,870
I think that there's a story engine that
is selected that drives people to say,

194
00:08:58,110 --> 00:09:00,330
okay,
I need a representation for wisdom.

195
00:09:00,331 --> 00:09:03,750
So if you look around your village or 
your city or your community,

196
00:09:04,020 --> 00:09:06,210
that will tend to land on somebody who's
older,

197
00:09:06,270 --> 00:09:11,270
like it's ingrained in them.
So there's different choices that 

198
00:09:11,270 --> 00:09:11,270
happen.
I don't believe that,

199
00:09:11,270 --> 00:09:14,970
that there is sort of essential 
specifics that are floating in our head,

200
00:09:14,971 --> 00:09:17,970
but the mechanism to make,
to make meaning,

201
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:23,000
um,
he's in there and the mechanism to look 

202
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:26,211
at different things that are in the 
world around us and the plugin symbols 

203
00:09:26,211 --> 00:09:27,120
and to make them construct a certain 
way.

204
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:29,340
And that's why if you look at like the 
epic of Gilgamesh,

205
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:32,280
it's a direct overlay for the 
terminator,

206
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:33,140
right?
I mean,

207
00:09:33,150 --> 00:09:38,150
so there's all these overlaps and nuance
between the ways that we're used to 

208
00:09:38,150 --> 00:09:41,931
processing story.
What do you make of the fact that it 

209
00:09:41,931 --> 00:09:44,811
seems like the only thing we can 
seemingly do right in Hollywood these 

210
00:09:44,811 --> 00:09:46,770
days is make superhero movies.
Is there some like extra meaning to that

211
00:09:46,771 --> 00:09:51,771
right now?
Like we're making blockbuster after 

212
00:09:51,771 --> 00:09:53,991
blockbuster,
at least marble is just blown it out of 

213
00:09:53,991 --> 00:09:56,091
the water with all of these things.
And we don't seem to be making a lot of 

214
00:09:56,091 --> 00:09:56,091
new,
original stories anymore.

215
00:09:56,580 --> 00:09:57,690
Well,
I'm a little.

216
00:09:58,380 --> 00:09:59,670
I'm divided on that.
I mean,

217
00:09:59,671 --> 00:10:02,070
my favorite movie last year was wind 
river.

218
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:03,630
I don't know if you saw.
I didn't see that.

219
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:07,440
Heard of it.
Taylor Sheridan is the writer director.

220
00:10:07,590 --> 00:10:10,440
He also wrote hell or high water and he 
wrote a scenario.

221
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:11,970
Okay.
He's amazing.

222
00:10:12,210 --> 00:10:14,460
So there's interesting work that's being
done.

223
00:10:14,461 --> 00:10:19,461
I mean,
I think there's a preponderance of 

224
00:10:19,461 --> 00:10:22,010
superhero stuff because as we are sort 
of laying waste to some of the 

225
00:10:22,351 --> 00:10:25,260
structures that have protected us in a 
lot of ways.

226
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:27,720
It's sort of the new gods and the new 
mythology.

227
00:10:27,810 --> 00:10:30,180
I mean in the case of thor literally.
Right.

228
00:10:30,181 --> 00:10:31,560
And so I think that it,
it,

229
00:10:31,561 --> 00:10:34,530
it's,
it's this overlay for us to contend with

230
00:10:34,531 --> 00:10:36,870
and make meaning with,
with bigger symbols in our life.

231
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:37,830
I mean,
it's so weird.

232
00:10:37,870 --> 00:10:39,210
I Love Batman,
right?

233
00:10:39,930 --> 00:10:42,180
You're a Batman guy to just by being a 
marvel guy.

234
00:10:42,570 --> 00:10:47,570
But it was so funny because I was out 
the other day and there was a guy with 

235
00:10:47,570 --> 00:10:48,600
like a Batman Wallet and a Batman Tattoo
and a Batman shirt and I was like,

236
00:10:48,930 --> 00:10:51,660
we're grown men.
What are we doing?

237
00:10:51,690 --> 00:10:53,330
What does this mean?
Right?

238
00:10:53,430 --> 00:10:55,080
You have a wallet.
It's sorta like,

239
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:58,260
is it that different than having a cross
around your neck?

240
00:10:58,290 --> 00:11:00,570
Like why are we,
if you like it,

241
00:11:00,571 --> 00:11:02,310
if you like or comment if you like a 
movie,

242
00:11:02,311 --> 00:11:05,490
why are we necessarily like ingraining 
that in our skin?

243
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:07,170
Right.
And having that be on our,

244
00:11:07,650 --> 00:11:09,030
on our,
on our clothes.

245
00:11:09,031 --> 00:11:10,890
Like why would we wear this with a 
shield?

246
00:11:11,230 --> 00:11:16,230
I think there's a lot of,
a sort of religious overlay to what 

247
00:11:16,230 --> 00:11:16,230
these represent.
Yeah.

248
00:11:16,260 --> 00:11:17,460
Well the stories,
right?

249
00:11:17,461 --> 00:11:20,220
These stories of good and evil and the 
way star wars,

250
00:11:20,221 --> 00:11:24,150
at least the originals affected me or,
or the way now.

251
00:11:24,151 --> 00:11:29,151
I mean,
you can get so much truth and 

252
00:11:29,151 --> 00:11:29,151
interesting,
deep,

253
00:11:29,151 --> 00:11:32,520
profound psychological,
a thought out of the,

254
00:11:32,521 --> 00:11:34,440
uh,
the original Batman trilogy.

255
00:11:34,441 --> 00:11:35,570
It's incredible.
Well,

256
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:37,890
it's funny how good and evil and laying 
waste to the world.

257
00:11:37,891 --> 00:11:40,640
I mean that heath ledger joker is just 
amazing.

258
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:41,460
Perfection.
Yeah.

259
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:42,480
Well,
so it's funny.

260
00:11:42,481 --> 00:11:44,100
So you look at,
there's sort of,

261
00:11:44,101 --> 00:11:49,101
we have a direct line with star wars in 
some ways because you have a young who 

262
00:11:49,101 --> 00:11:50,940
has a fairly impenetrable cannon,
like he's not breathing reading,

263
00:11:50,970 --> 00:11:55,970
you know,
you can read Freud and the studies read 

264
00:11:55,970 --> 00:11:55,970
like short stories.
I mean,

265
00:11:55,970 --> 00:11:57,790
so it's obvious for me in hindsight why 
studied it,

266
00:11:57,791 --> 00:12:00,790
but things never make sense when you're 
just following things that you love.

267
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:06,120
And I was super interested in 
psychoanalysis and in hindsight it's 

268
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:08,950
like of course all young wrote about was
narrative and all Freud wrote about was,

269
00:12:09,220 --> 00:12:14,220
you know,
interesting psychological case studies 

270
00:12:14,220 --> 00:12:14,350
which are also narrative based and they 
read like short stories.

271
00:12:14,590 --> 00:12:17,020
But so you have a young who's very tough
to penetrate.

272
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:18,790
So you have Joseph Campbell who came 
along,

273
00:12:18,791 --> 00:12:21,040
I think of Campbell is like the cliff 
notes for young.

274
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:26,400
Um,
I don't think Campbell has a lot of 

275
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:26,400
stuff that if you,
you know,

276
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:27,890
like young's tricky,
you know,

277
00:12:27,910 --> 00:12:30,820
he's like reading young takes a lot of 
work and focus.

278
00:12:30,970 --> 00:12:33,730
So Campbell makes that more accessible.
And then Campbell had,

279
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:35,740
you know,
that's where Bill Moyer,

280
00:12:35,741 --> 00:12:37,090
that famous interview,
right?

281
00:12:37,091 --> 00:12:42,091
And Lucas then specifies that makes it 
specific in a way and when you're 

282
00:12:42,091 --> 00:12:44,290
talking about meaning in stories,
that sort of thing,

283
00:12:44,291 --> 00:12:49,291
it's like no one will deny.
You can find meaning from Freud and 

284
00:12:49,291 --> 00:12:49,291
young.
Right?

285
00:12:49,291 --> 00:12:50,020
But when that's distilled down into 
something that's specific,

286
00:12:50,021 --> 00:12:55,021
that embodies those principles,
that's the thing that sort of tattooed 

287
00:12:55,021 --> 00:12:58,921
on our spinal cords in this culture,
like who didn't have that experience 

288
00:12:58,921 --> 00:12:59,080
with Star Wars,
right?

289
00:12:59,081 --> 00:13:04,081
Who doesn't show up with that.
And that's because it's taking these 

290
00:13:04,081 --> 00:13:04,840
things that are literally a 
philosophical,

291
00:13:04,841 --> 00:13:08,550
psychological meaning making human 
beings in,

292
00:13:08,551 --> 00:13:09,670
in,
in these bodies,

293
00:13:09,671 --> 00:13:14,671
in these cannons and distilling it down 
to something that everybody can plug 

294
00:13:14,671 --> 00:13:14,671
into.

295
00:13:14,671 --> 00:13:15,790
Whether you get it at whatever level,
you get it out,

296
00:13:15,791 --> 00:13:20,791
you get it at.
Seeing those at seven is different than 

297
00:13:20,791 --> 00:13:23,101
us seeing them at 30 or 40.
So when Jordan takes that to the 

298
00:13:23,101 --> 00:13:23,650
religious place,
did,

299
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:26,320
do you follow that thinking there?
Yeah,

300
00:13:26,321 --> 00:13:28,930
and I'm from like an atheist Jewish,
you know,

301
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:31,370
my socialist background,
you know,

302
00:13:31,390 --> 00:13:33,580
like I'm not conventionally religiously 
ready,

303
00:13:33,770 --> 00:13:37,480
but it's like to deny that a story isn't
that successful.

304
00:13:37,930 --> 00:13:40,660
So here's a weird thing that's always an
issue that I have with,

305
00:13:40,690 --> 00:13:45,690
with Democrats.
I know you get very defensive when 

306
00:13:45,690 --> 00:13:45,690
people have problems with Democrats 
easier.

307
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:51,600
There's this funny thing where Democrats
tend to view other cultures with great 

308
00:13:52,391 --> 00:13:54,250
reverence,
especially the more exotic they are,

309
00:13:54,251 --> 00:13:59,251
even if there's some fundamental issues 
and the other cultures that should be 

310
00:13:59,251 --> 00:13:59,251
relevant,
right?

311
00:13:59,251 --> 00:14:03,241
Like you have hardcore feminists who 
were supporting certain regimes that 

312
00:14:03,241 --> 00:14:03,550
treat women terribly and you're like,
we should jar out of that.

313
00:14:03,550 --> 00:14:08,550
Like that appreciation for the exotic.
And the one thing I find frustrating is 

314
00:14:08,550 --> 00:14:12,691
we have such a collection of different 
cultures in the United States and it's 

315
00:14:12,691 --> 00:14:16,771
like,
why can't you go to Alabama or the deep 

316
00:14:16,771 --> 00:14:16,771
south?
I love the deep south.

317
00:14:16,771 --> 00:14:20,280
Like when I sold my first book,
I drove through the deep south to go to 

318
00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:20,280
the Bourbon distilleries and a see 
faulkner's home.

319
00:14:20,650 --> 00:14:25,650
And why don't you look at that and 
people's relationship with the second 

320
00:14:25,650 --> 00:14:28,771
amendment and their relationship with 
each other and their relationship with 

321
00:14:28,771 --> 00:14:29,770
their value system as also being a 
culture that is different.

322
00:14:29,771 --> 00:14:31,630
That should be appreciated,
right?

323
00:14:31,631 --> 00:14:34,090
We don't.
It's a weird thing.

324
00:14:34,091 --> 00:14:36,880
And so we do it for the outward world,
but sort of,

325
00:14:37,010 --> 00:14:39,670
it's to be safely exotic.
Right?

326
00:14:39,671 --> 00:14:42,040
But if someone disagrees with you,
and look,

327
00:14:42,070 --> 00:14:43,840
this is true both ways.
I mean I'm not,

328
00:14:43,841 --> 00:14:48,841
I'm not merely beating up Democrats,
but it's a frustration that I've had to 

329
00:14:48,841 --> 00:14:48,841
say people think differently.

330
00:14:48,910 --> 00:14:53,910
So if you want to pretend that you're 
going jump into their brain and make a 

331
00:14:53,910 --> 00:14:55,400
moral judgement on why they hold their 
opinions,

332
00:14:55,580 --> 00:15:00,580
that's not good for anybody.
But the same thing holds true for 

333
00:15:00,580 --> 00:15:03,191
stories.
It's like going to any university and 

334
00:15:03,191 --> 00:15:05,561
it's super cool and hip to talk about 
you to analyze the marvel stories or to 

335
00:15:05,561 --> 00:15:06,230
analyze star wars.
And it's like,

336
00:15:06,350 --> 00:15:11,350
why wouldn't you do the same with a 
story that is so successful that it 

337
00:15:11,350 --> 00:15:14,420
dwarfs all of those over centuries and 
centuries that his,

338
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:17,810
you know,
given rise to cathedrals and,

339
00:15:17,870 --> 00:15:18,650
and,
and,

340
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:21,320
and wars and like,
this is stuff that is moved.

341
00:15:21,340 --> 00:15:21,730
Right,
right,

342
00:15:21,731 --> 00:15:26,731
right.
So it's like if you're into those 

343
00:15:26,731 --> 00:15:26,731
stories,
it's like,

344
00:15:26,731 --> 00:15:26,731
ah,
that was,

345
00:15:26,731 --> 00:15:26,850
that was yesterday.
You know,

346
00:15:26,980 --> 00:15:29,060
you're a Jesus freak and it's like,
wait a minute,

347
00:15:29,090 --> 00:15:34,090
like write a story.
Somebody that guys at the star wars 

348
00:15:34,090 --> 00:15:34,090
convention.

349
00:15:34,090 --> 00:15:34,090
Yeah,
exactly.

350
00:15:34,090 --> 00:15:34,460
Yeah.
And it's like,

351
00:15:34,461 --> 00:15:39,461
well,
so what's the story of Jesus like if 

352
00:15:39,461 --> 00:15:39,461
you,
if you shoulder your own burden,

353
00:15:39,461 --> 00:15:41,780
if you bear your own cross and accept 
your own suffering,

354
00:15:41,781 --> 00:15:46,781
that's the only means toward,
to transforming it or to transcending 

355
00:15:46,781 --> 00:15:46,781
it,
I shouldn't say.

356
00:15:46,781 --> 00:15:47,300
And so it's like,
oh,

357
00:15:47,301 --> 00:15:49,820
is that relevant in relationships or 
psychology?

358
00:15:50,090 --> 00:15:55,090
Like what's the best approach?
If someone's really screwed up and 

359
00:15:55,090 --> 00:15:55,090
complaining and as a murderer in the 
whole world,

360
00:15:55,160 --> 00:15:55,930
like you go,
yeah,

361
00:15:55,931 --> 00:15:57,170
I'm honey.
The world's awful.

362
00:15:57,171 --> 00:15:58,490
Like,
is that the parenting that you want?

363
00:15:58,491 --> 00:16:01,310
Or to say what,
what are the things you're doing?

364
00:16:01,311 --> 00:16:03,290
Where are the faults as they exist in 
you?

365
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:05,210
It's one thing that Jews are great on 
the Old Testament.

366
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:07,360
God's angry we screwed up,
right?

367
00:16:07,370 --> 00:16:08,750
Jordan?
Jordan says that a lot.

368
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:14,200
It's like where is it centered in you 
and what is the way that you can accept 

369
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:17,261
the conditions in the inherent tragedy 
of life in a way that allows you to 

370
00:16:17,261 --> 00:16:18,560
transcend that and it's like that's 
played again and again and again.

371
00:16:18,590 --> 00:16:21,170
I mean,
you look at Tony Scott,

372
00:16:21,171 --> 00:16:26,171
Denzel Washington's a man on fire and 
it's like you look at how beautifully 

373
00:16:26,171 --> 00:16:30,761
that takes an hour in the first act.
Just the relationship between him and 

374
00:16:30,761 --> 00:16:34,091
the girl and it's basically a classic 
like you need to become a monster to 

375
00:16:34,091 --> 00:16:37,571
hunt monsters,
but it's the story of his salvation and 

376
00:16:37,571 --> 00:16:37,650
sacrifice for something innocent.
It's just,

377
00:16:37,670 --> 00:16:42,670
it's,
that's my favorite modern movie 

378
00:16:42,670 --> 00:16:42,670
probably.
What do you make of the fact that people

379
00:16:42,670 --> 00:16:42,670
actually care about this stuff right 
now?

380
00:16:42,670 --> 00:16:47,651
Like this type of conversation and being
able to relate it to either comic books 

381
00:16:47,651 --> 00:16:51,551
or movies and still talk about religion 
or talk about it from an atheist 

382
00:16:51,551 --> 00:16:56,411
perspective that people actually care 
about this were I think four years ago 

383
00:16:56,411 --> 00:16:57,370
if have a whole bunch of us had been 
talking about this,

384
00:16:57,410 --> 00:16:58,600
people will be like,
what the hell?

385
00:16:58,620 --> 00:16:59,960
Like he likes this relevant.

386
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:00,740
What?
What?

387
00:17:01,010 --> 00:17:06,010
You guys live in your mom's basement?
Well that's what they'd be saying 

388
00:17:06,010 --> 00:17:07,500
covered with snack crumbs.
That may well be true,

389
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:10,320
but I cleaned up before.
I can't remember that.

390
00:17:10,510 --> 00:17:12,890
We appreciate.
So I mean,

391
00:17:12,891 --> 00:17:17,891
I think what's interesting is there's a 
letter f Scott Fitzgerald sent to his 

392
00:17:17,891 --> 00:17:19,730
editor and it's great because he talks 
about all the notes that you get from an

393
00:17:19,731 --> 00:17:24,731
attorney.
He said the American reading public is 

394
00:17:24,731 --> 00:17:25,790
totally stupid.
It needs to be led by the nose or number

395
00:17:25,791 --> 00:17:30,791
two,
massively brilliant and can interpret 

396
00:17:30,791 --> 00:17:30,870
every problem that you have more like 
it's,

397
00:17:30,900 --> 00:17:35,900
it's everything.
It's so morphous view that we always 

398
00:17:35,900 --> 00:17:37,730
take toward society and so there's this 
view of like the American attention span

399
00:17:37,731 --> 00:17:42,731
is shortening.
You look at it like we went from books 

400
00:17:42,731 --> 00:17:44,780
to blogs to kind of my space.
You had to build out to facebook,

401
00:17:44,781 --> 00:17:45,860
to twitter,
to instagram,

402
00:17:45,861 --> 00:17:49,860
like this ever shrinking aspect,
but it's too simplistic.

403
00:17:49,890 --> 00:17:51,120
I mean,
everything's too simplistic,

404
00:17:51,121 --> 00:17:56,121
so we have podcasts,
exploding audio books and publishing 

405
00:17:56,121 --> 00:17:57,690
exploding and this sort of longer form 
discourse.

406
00:17:57,720 --> 00:17:59,160
I mean,
what I think is really interesting,

407
00:17:59,161 --> 00:18:00,720
this is a lot of people were hungry for 
it.

408
00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:05,920
I mean,
I always say to Jordan and it makes no 

409
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:07,440
sense at all that he did a lecture 
series on the psychological underpinning

410
00:18:07,441 --> 00:18:11,060
of the Bible and more than three people 
showed up like it just.

411
00:18:11,100 --> 00:18:16,100
You wouldn't anticipate that,
but people are a lot smarter and are a 

412
00:18:16,100 --> 00:18:17,850
lot more oriented in their desire for 
meaning.

413
00:18:18,300 --> 00:18:23,300
Then we give credit.
I can tell you that from being on this 

414
00:18:23,300 --> 00:18:23,490
tour with him in the middle,
he'll often say something about how he's

415
00:18:23,491 --> 00:18:25,650
working on the next series of biblical 
exteriors.

416
00:18:25,990 --> 00:18:29,970
It gets a huge applause every time.
Like people want more of that.

417
00:18:30,450 --> 00:18:32,400
Absolutely.
Whether they're believers or not.

418
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:35,540
I think many of the people that watch 
them and appreciate them actually aren't

419
00:18:35,541 --> 00:18:37,500
believers,
at least in a traditional sense.

420
00:18:37,560 --> 00:18:39,960
I mean,
and who knows what that means.

421
00:18:40,250 --> 00:18:45,250
Does it,
am I a believer or like do I believe 

422
00:18:45,250 --> 00:18:48,351
those stories contain some of the most 
fundamental grains of first principles 

423
00:18:48,351 --> 00:18:50,430
of orienting oneself in the world?
Absolutely.

424
00:18:50,970 --> 00:18:53,310
So it's like what does it even mean to 
be a believer?

425
00:18:53,670 --> 00:18:57,570
But I mean the other thing I find really
interesting with it is that it's sort of

426
00:18:57,571 --> 00:19:02,571
going back to our conversation about 
archetypes and my belief that it's 

427
00:19:02,571 --> 00:19:05,550
selected is we were sort of meaning 
making creatures and so if,

428
00:19:05,610 --> 00:19:10,610
if there's a discussion that Jordan has,
if you guys aren't conversation on a 

429
00:19:10,610 --> 00:19:11,370
stage or Eric's arguing with Ben,
right?

430
00:19:11,371 --> 00:19:14,100
You get these opposing views within this
group,

431
00:19:15,330 --> 00:19:17,160
people are engaged in that.
If there,

432
00:19:17,161 --> 00:19:19,560
if it feels like there's a genuine focus
for,

433
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:24,920
for meaning because it's like that's the
thing that we want more than anything 

434
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:25,980
and it gets hijacked a lot for the 
purpose to be like,

435
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,060
oh,
I just want to be happy.

436
00:19:27,060 --> 00:19:29,670
And it's like happiness is temporary and
this is a femoral.

437
00:19:30,180 --> 00:19:35,180
So I think that's what's happening with 
these longer form discussions that 

438
00:19:35,191 --> 00:19:40,191
people are engaged in is because it 
feels like there's something real 

439
00:19:40,191 --> 00:19:43,041
happening and it's not buzzwords and 
cliches and facile dismissals.

440
00:19:43,220 --> 00:19:44,970
It's,
it's something that's real.

441
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:50,000
It's almost like also at the same time 
mainstream has become so meaningless,

442
00:19:50,230 --> 00:19:55,230
right?
That our ability to just do this and 

443
00:19:55,230 --> 00:19:58,371
have a little bit of an exchange maybe 
with some differences and some 

444
00:19:58,371 --> 00:20:01,521
agreements has that much more value 
right now where 10 years ago maybe it 

445
00:20:01,521 --> 00:20:05,781
wouldn't have had so much value but the.
But as mainstream careens off into the 

446
00:20:05,781 --> 00:20:06,480
abyss.
Well,

447
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:07,770
we're still here.
Well,

448
00:20:07,771 --> 00:20:12,771
it's funny too because in some ways a 
reasonable centrist view is now radical,

449
00:20:13,530 --> 00:20:18,530
right?
So if you have a senator who's willing 

450
00:20:18,530 --> 00:20:19,950
to compromise and interact with the 
other side to pass legislation,

451
00:20:20,340 --> 00:20:25,340
which is one of the tenants of how 
Congress had was the right,

452
00:20:25,670 --> 00:20:27,030
that's sort of radical.

453
00:20:27,060 --> 00:20:31,140
Like if you don't only vilify and shut 
down from either side and,

454
00:20:31,270 --> 00:20:33,480
and continue to polarize.
And actually,

455
00:20:33,481 --> 00:20:33,880
I,
you know,

456
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:38,900
part of this,
I've been thinking a lot about how this 

457
00:20:38,900 --> 00:20:40,971
has driven with mainstream media and you
and I were talking a little bit about 

458
00:20:40,971 --> 00:20:45,351
trying to use the intellectual dark web 
is an ability to sort of broaden out 

459
00:20:45,351 --> 00:20:47,350
what views are of different parties and 
you know,

460
00:20:47,351 --> 00:20:52,351
it's all heterodoxy base,
but like how do we bring in centrist 

461
00:20:52,351 --> 00:20:55,921
views and have them represented.
Because one of the things I've been 

462
00:20:55,921 --> 00:20:58,531
thinking about a lot,
I've been doing a lot of candidate 

463
00:20:58,531 --> 00:20:58,780
training.
I've talked to dozens of candidates from

464
00:20:59,140 --> 00:21:01,960
Tennessee to Alabama,
like all over the country.

465
00:21:02,410 --> 00:21:07,410
Virtually no one that I talked to is 
making it a key key aspect of their 

466
00:21:07,451 --> 00:21:08,800
platform.
You know,

467
00:21:08,801 --> 00:21:12,250
trans bathrooms in democratic socialism,
literally not a one.

468
00:21:12,700 --> 00:21:13,660
So then it's like,
wait,

469
00:21:13,661 --> 00:21:16,150
is there a role that we're all playing,
you know,

470
00:21:16,151 --> 00:21:18,880
even in this umbrella of the 
intellectual,

471
00:21:18,881 --> 00:21:19,420
dark web.

472
00:21:19,420 --> 00:21:24,420
But then the mainstream media,
everyone who's sort of virtue signaling 

473
00:21:24,420 --> 00:21:26,140
on social media in starting to think,
you know,

474
00:21:26,141 --> 00:21:28,060
Eric calls it the Chihuahua fact.
I'm like,

475
00:21:28,061 --> 00:21:31,990
there's very loud people who are out at 
the edges and like maybe good for them,

476
00:21:31,991 --> 00:21:36,991
right?
Like I'm not in favor of d platforming 

477
00:21:36,991 --> 00:21:39,061
anybody on either on either edge,
but there's a huge story in the middle 

478
00:21:39,491 --> 00:21:42,230
that I think isn't being told and I 
think it's really important to,

479
00:21:42,250 --> 00:21:42,910
to,
to,

480
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:48,360
to have the Chihuahua fact not cow,
everyone in the middle from being able 

481
00:21:48,521 --> 00:21:50,770
to sort of speak up and have the 
discourse that they want to have.

482
00:21:51,290 --> 00:21:52,870
One of the things I told,
I sat down with the,

483
00:21:52,900 --> 00:21:56,590
with the Washington Post have sat down 
with some other places and said,

484
00:21:56,591 --> 00:22:01,591
look,
count the number of times that you've 

485
00:22:01,591 --> 00:22:01,591
written about,
for instance,

486
00:22:01,591 --> 00:22:01,591
it costs ego,
right?

487
00:22:01,591 --> 00:22:02,770
Like,
so she won in a very deep blue district,

488
00:22:02,771 --> 00:22:03,490
like good on her.

489
00:22:03,490 --> 00:22:05,630
Go off in the Bronx and when and see 
what,

490
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:08,440
what's going to work there.
That's not my proclivity,

491
00:22:08,441 --> 00:22:13,441
but I'm not denigrating that.
But it's like how many times have you 

492
00:22:13,441 --> 00:22:14,560
written about her verse versus Angie 
Craig Halley,

493
00:22:14,561 --> 00:22:19,120
Steven's Joseph crops or Ken Harbor?
All of these amazing former military pro

494
00:22:19,121 --> 00:22:21,360
business,
amazing Democratic candidates.

495
00:22:21,670 --> 00:22:23,630
But I'm guessing that 90 percent of the 
people watching,

496
00:22:23,631 --> 00:22:28,631
I haven't heard one of those names and 
she said she was all over everything 

497
00:22:28,631 --> 00:22:30,760
endlessly for weeks and everyone does 
that.

498
00:22:30,761 --> 00:22:33,730
So I've been trying to think about why,
why that is the case,

499
00:22:33,731 --> 00:22:38,731
you know,
I would bet if you go to the New York 

500
00:22:38,731 --> 00:22:38,731
Times or the Washington Post,
she's mentioned,

501
00:22:38,731 --> 00:22:43,620
you know,
10 x 20 x these other candidates if not 

502
00:22:43,620 --> 00:22:45,640
even more so.
I think from the right it makes sense.

503
00:22:45,670 --> 00:22:50,670
And the left does this too.
So this is not me claiming that the 

504
00:22:50,670 --> 00:22:53,671
rights owner who does this,
it makes sense to paint the parties 

505
00:22:53,671 --> 00:22:56,191
further left than it is because it's an 
easier sort of target to paint the 

506
00:22:56,191 --> 00:22:57,970
furthest extreme and then to denigrate 
that.

507
00:22:58,360 --> 00:23:03,360
But with the left they're doing it also 
I think because there's problems and 

508
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:04,570
they need clickbait and eyeballs.
So I think there's that.

509
00:23:04,990 --> 00:23:07,600
And I think there's also a sort of 
curious.

510
00:23:08,650 --> 00:23:13,650
There's a curious desire on the part of 
the left sometimes to continue to be 

511
00:23:13,650 --> 00:23:14,410
murdered.
Right.

512
00:23:14,411 --> 00:23:19,411
And I don't know if,
if sometimes there's a drive to app to 

513
00:23:19,411 --> 00:23:22,360
to further the stories that are stories 
that in fact are going to hurt the left.

514
00:23:22,750 --> 00:23:26,470
An example of that is when we talk about
progress that's being made,

515
00:23:26,471 --> 00:23:29,230
there's a lot of progress being made in 
race relations for,

516
00:23:29,470 --> 00:23:33,340
for women in business.
There's a propensity for the left to say

517
00:23:33,790 --> 00:23:38,790
everything's bad as it ever was.
Nothing's gotten better and you go 

518
00:23:38,790 --> 00:23:39,280
really like you.
Like today it's the same.

519
00:23:39,420 --> 00:23:43,330
Like this is not to say that there isn't
problematic widespread racism,

520
00:23:43,960 --> 00:23:46,700
you know,
but is it really the same as in during,

521
00:23:46,701 --> 00:23:48,860
before the civil rights is really the 
same as in Jim Crow,

522
00:23:48,861 --> 00:23:50,810
that nothing's changed and it comes.

523
00:23:50,810 --> 00:23:54,170
I think from a concern that if you can 
see that things are better than everyone

524
00:23:54,171 --> 00:23:56,570
will just give up and go home.
There was like a driver to it.

525
00:23:57,080 --> 00:24:02,080
And so I think that there's this aspect 
with how the left engages with progress 

526
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:03,860
and what candidates that it looks at 
that it's almost.

527
00:24:04,040 --> 00:24:06,560
And I think the right does,
has its own version of this.

528
00:24:06,561 --> 00:24:11,561
There's almost a desire to be constantly
upset and outraged or to constantly be 

529
00:24:11,561 --> 00:24:16,061
under the heel of what's viewed as the 
other side and what I'm noticing a lot 

530
00:24:16,061 --> 00:24:19,841
in the discourse that is the most 
advocated or is the most widely spread 

531
00:24:19,841 --> 00:24:24,041
is there's.
There's a real sort of martyr mentality 

532
00:24:24,041 --> 00:24:25,430
that lies beneath the outrage from 
either side.

533
00:24:26,750 --> 00:24:31,750
Okay,
so let's just back up a little bit 

534
00:24:31,750 --> 00:24:34,220
better.
So we come from a pretty similar 

535
00:24:34,220 --> 00:24:36,521
political backgrounds,
both pretty much democrats our whole 

536
00:24:36,521 --> 00:24:36,560
life,
both part of the left,

537
00:24:36,561 --> 00:24:37,340
the whole thing.

538
00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:42,640
I think we differ a little bit now and 
that I basically think that ship has 

539
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:43,190
sailed on this thing.
I.

540
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:47,570
I do think that the left has just rotted
the Democrats from the inside.

541
00:24:47,571 --> 00:24:52,571
I get that there are these good people 
and I look forward to having many of 

542
00:24:52,571 --> 00:24:53,990
them sit in that very chair and I'll 
hope that some things can return,

543
00:24:53,991 --> 00:24:56,390
but I think it's going to get a lot 
worse before it gets better.

544
00:24:56,570 --> 00:24:59,090
You're really trying to help the 
messaging of this thing,

545
00:25:00,970 --> 00:25:02,180
the focus,
the messaging,

546
00:25:02,360 --> 00:25:06,020
but basically it get rid of some of the 
identity politics stuff.

547
00:25:06,230 --> 00:25:08,990
Maybe stop doing so much class warfare 
stuff.

548
00:25:09,260 --> 00:25:14,260
I think a few other,
a few other pieces of this convinced me 

549
00:25:14,260 --> 00:25:15,380
that a,
it's possible.

550
00:25:16,100 --> 00:25:17,330
Well,
you're right.

551
00:25:17,331 --> 00:25:22,310
First of all that I bet if we sat down 
and did a chart of our political views,

552
00:25:23,080 --> 00:25:28,080
I think years in minor,
the closest of anybody in the 

553
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:32,261
intellectual dark web,
like you and I are probably aligned on 

554
00:25:32,261 --> 00:25:33,170
everything from gun discipline to 
abortion.

555
00:25:33,170 --> 00:25:35,430
Like if you go down the list,
um,

556
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:41,080
and you're right,
that the biggest difference is like 

557
00:25:41,080 --> 00:25:42,310
you've left the party and you and I'm 
trying to write.

558
00:25:42,340 --> 00:25:44,840
I haven't joined a new party but just 
for the record,

559
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:48,230
but I don't consider myself a democratic
political.

560
00:25:48,231 --> 00:25:49,900
If that's a party,
I'll join that party.

561
00:25:50,030 --> 00:25:55,030
Yeah.
And I'm trying to kind of refocus the 

562
00:25:55,030 --> 00:25:55,070
party in a way that,
that,

563
00:25:55,130 --> 00:26:00,130
that lives up to the promise.
I think it has specifically to when 

564
00:26:00,130 --> 00:26:00,130
people like you back.
Yeah,

565
00:26:00,380 --> 00:26:05,380
it's a long road.
There's a lot of hurdles and there's a 

566
00:26:05,380 --> 00:26:08,501
lot of quagmires and we have been,
there are a lot of errors that have been

567
00:26:11,001 --> 00:26:16,001
made and I think that one of them is,
I believe that corruption is a very 

568
00:26:16,671 --> 00:26:21,671
widespread problem.
I don't think that the Democrats can 

569
00:26:21,671 --> 00:26:24,350
continue to make an argument that we're 
the less corruptive to parties.

570
00:26:25,210 --> 00:26:26,580
I don't think that's a winning argument.
Yeah.

571
00:26:26,581 --> 00:26:29,570
I think you could probably make the 
counter argument pretty easily,

572
00:26:29,660 --> 00:26:34,660
right?
I mean the Democrats did a lot of stuff 

573
00:26:34,660 --> 00:26:36,641
against Bernie and,
and Donna Brazil and the questions to 

574
00:26:36,641 --> 00:26:39,881
hillary and all sorts of other stuff 
that you could argue there are probably 

575
00:26:39,881 --> 00:26:41,450
more corrupt and that's,
that might be another.

576
00:26:41,550 --> 00:26:46,550
I don't even think that's an important 
argument to have any anymore because I 

577
00:26:46,550 --> 00:26:46,890
think put it this way,
let's assume from my perspective,

578
00:26:46,950 --> 00:26:51,950
let's just take the leap to say I 
believe the Democrats are less corrupt 

579
00:26:51,950 --> 00:26:51,950
than,
than,

580
00:26:51,950 --> 00:26:56,720
than what is happening right now under,
under this administration and some of 

581
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:56,720
the stuff that's going on.
Okay.

582
00:26:56,720 --> 00:27:01,630
Um,
I don't think we can have an argument 

583
00:27:01,630 --> 00:27:01,630
that says vote for us were corrupt,
but just kind of lost.

584
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:06,760
I don't think that's a winning argument.
And I think if we're going to engage 

585
00:27:06,760 --> 00:27:07,640
with people like you,
uh,

586
00:27:07,740 --> 00:27:09,120
you know,
Libertarians,

587
00:27:09,150 --> 00:27:11,580
you know,
Republicans,

588
00:27:12,300 --> 00:27:15,180
the first thing they're going to say 
when it comes to corruption validly.

589
00:27:15,180 --> 00:27:15,870
So it's like,
oh,

590
00:27:15,871 --> 00:27:17,310
you want to clean up corruption.
Okay.

591
00:27:17,311 --> 00:27:22,311
You first.
That's a reasonable first claim for 

592
00:27:22,311 --> 00:27:22,710
people who have been in the party and 
feel that they're lost.

593
00:27:23,070 --> 00:27:28,070
And so a lot of the hope that I have 
with the party or these new candidates 

594
00:27:28,070 --> 00:27:31,800
and voices and as part of my dismay 
about the way that it's painted that the

595
00:27:31,801 --> 00:27:35,420
far left is what's getting the most 
attention or,

596
00:27:35,470 --> 00:27:39,780
or like the ridiculous stuff that 
happens on college campuses.

597
00:27:39,930 --> 00:27:44,930
Like a lot of the attention that it's 
sort of like claiming that every person 

598
00:27:44,930 --> 00:27:47,160
who's on the right is,
is you know,

599
00:27:47,370 --> 00:27:50,160
a radicalized neo Nazi.
It's like,

600
00:27:50,360 --> 00:27:53,070
so where is,
where is the internal push back on that?

601
00:27:53,071 --> 00:27:58,071
Because I can see it this way,
that from someone that was always a 

602
00:27:58,071 --> 00:27:59,040
lefty and a Democrat and a progressive,
the whole thing,

603
00:27:59,250 --> 00:28:01,340
and now although I still consider myself
liberal,

604
00:28:01,341 --> 00:28:04,590
I definitely,
if someone sat me for four hours here,

605
00:28:04,591 --> 00:28:06,780
I could probably get to the point where 
I'd say I'm a libertarian.

606
00:28:07,290 --> 00:28:10,380
I see ice,
intellectual flexibility on the right.

607
00:28:10,381 --> 00:28:13,290
These days I see a libertarian side,
I see the never trumpers,

608
00:28:13,320 --> 00:28:16,350
I see the trumpers,
I see sort of the Mug lefties.

609
00:28:16,351 --> 00:28:21,351
Like I do see like a couple of different
pillars that are all sort of lefties,

610
00:28:21,811 --> 00:28:23,250
the Mug,
the Mug lefties.

611
00:28:23,251 --> 00:28:25,160
What I would say like I feel like a mug 
lefty.

612
00:28:25,180 --> 00:28:30,180
I,
you know that I see like a couple of 

613
00:28:30,180 --> 00:28:33,410
different groups that are thought of on 
the right right now that differ on 

614
00:28:33,410 --> 00:28:37,671
certain things.
But basically you're agreeing to 

615
00:28:37,671 --> 00:28:37,671
disagree.
I don't see that on the left,

616
00:28:37,671 --> 00:28:39,840
but you just mentioned a couple of names
that you believe are people will.

617
00:28:39,841 --> 00:28:44,841
Here's the thing,
that's what I think is happening and it 

618
00:28:44,841 --> 00:28:44,841
goes to your point about where the 
oxygen is,

619
00:28:44,841 --> 00:28:45,720
but if,
if it's,

620
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:47,220
if there's some evidence of it,
I,

621
00:28:47,280 --> 00:28:51,570
I'd love to see it in here as a,
a trail of candidates.

622
00:28:51,570 --> 00:28:51,900
I mean,
I,

623
00:28:51,901 --> 00:28:55,350
I could list 20 candidates,
which I won't just rattle off,

624
00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:57,570
like you said,
people don't necessarily know,

625
00:28:58,130 --> 00:29:03,130
you know,
Katie Hill and Haley Stevens and Kendra 

626
00:29:03,130 --> 00:29:06,410
Horn.
I'm dealing with people everyday who 

627
00:29:06,410 --> 00:29:07,700
we're talking about number one thing is 
anticorruption and they're signing.

628
00:29:07,710 --> 00:29:12,710
I asked yesterday,
I was at an event with six candidates 

629
00:29:12,710 --> 00:29:13,120
and Adam Schiff and I said,
you know,

630
00:29:13,230 --> 00:29:14,790
I've worked with some of them.
I'm working with others.

631
00:29:14,791 --> 00:29:16,890
Instead of all of you signed on the 
disclose act,

632
00:29:16,920 --> 00:29:21,090
disclose act is vowing to a name 
lobbyists,

633
00:29:21,150 --> 00:29:23,820
all lobbyist influence.
It's all to get money out of politics,

634
00:29:23,821 --> 00:29:28,821
which I,
which I think is the number one issue 

635
00:29:28,821 --> 00:29:28,821
isn't business.
It's,

636
00:29:28,821 --> 00:29:31,480
it's sort of the donor class level and 
influence of lobbyists.

637
00:29:31,560 --> 00:29:33,120
Like I think that's a really big 
problem.

638
00:29:33,670 --> 00:29:36,090
Um,
and do you disclose everybody?

639
00:29:36,150 --> 00:29:41,150
You disclose your donors,
which I'm going to talk more about from 

640
00:29:41,150 --> 00:29:43,281
a libertarian perspective in a second 
because we had a very interesting 

641
00:29:43,281 --> 00:29:44,410
conversation with Ben that shifted some 
of my thinking on that.

642
00:29:45,300 --> 00:29:46,450
Lobbyists,
right?

643
00:29:46,460 --> 00:29:49,030
You going to name all your lobbyists,
are you going to come out for protection

644
00:29:49,031 --> 00:29:50,710
of the vote no matter what?
Right?

645
00:29:50,740 --> 00:29:55,740
Are you going to come out hard against 
taking pac money for individual 

646
00:29:55,740 --> 00:29:57,310
candidates or like bombing the other 
side through a pack,

647
00:29:57,550 --> 00:29:59,470
a anti Gerrymandering,
right?

648
00:29:59,500 --> 00:30:03,130
Which means either a bi partisan 
committee that does it,

649
00:30:03,131 --> 00:30:06,460
which has some problems or judicial or 
I'm increasingly starting to think about

650
00:30:06,461 --> 00:30:08,680
that.
There was a congress congressional fix,

651
00:30:08,681 --> 00:30:10,510
like if you're really great job,
Congress doing a lot more.

652
00:30:11,050 --> 00:30:16,050
Imagine if they did anything right,
so it's swearing a bunch of things 

653
00:30:16,050 --> 00:30:19,351
before they're going forward.
There's dozens and dozens of names on 

654
00:30:19,351 --> 00:30:22,741
the list of people who have signed onto 
this call is to act and I believe 

655
00:30:22,741 --> 00:30:23,140
they're all democrats.
They're all younger Democrats.

656
00:30:23,141 --> 00:30:25,840
Would this wave.
Now the disclosed thing is troubling for

657
00:30:25,841 --> 00:30:28,460
me because you get stupid stuff like,
um,

658
00:30:29,410 --> 00:30:32,670
this in and out,
a boycott that lasted a day and a half,

659
00:30:33,280 --> 00:30:35,550
which if people aren't familiar with it,
I think somebody called it,

660
00:30:35,590 --> 00:30:40,590
they found out the in and out had 
donated to Republicans and called for a 

661
00:30:40,590 --> 00:30:40,900
boycott and the best thing in southern 
California,

662
00:30:40,901 --> 00:30:41,710
everyone's like,
dude,

663
00:30:41,860 --> 00:30:42,960
that's in and out,
like,

664
00:30:43,030 --> 00:30:45,250
sorry,
not happening.

665
00:30:45,610 --> 00:30:50,610
But then they found out that they'd 
given money to Democrats and like the 

666
00:30:50,610 --> 00:30:53,491
whole thing is this mass.
And so and I understand and things are 

667
00:30:53,491 --> 00:30:56,431
also complicated.
Like Nike Right now has Colin 

668
00:30:56,431 --> 00:30:57,250
Kaepernick's the face of that,
they're calling him a $6,000,000,000

669
00:30:57,251 --> 00:31:02,251
man.
They rent the ground floor of trump 

670
00:31:02,251 --> 00:31:02,251
tower for $13,000,000
a year.

671
00:31:02,251 --> 00:31:06,560
Okay.
They've given three times as much money 

672
00:31:06,560 --> 00:31:06,560
to Republicans and Democrats.
So it's like who are we boycotting?

673
00:31:06,560 --> 00:31:11,461
And meanwhile there's a sandwich chain 
that just got put out of business 

674
00:31:11,461 --> 00:31:12,160
because the owner took a picture with 
trump,

675
00:31:12,330 --> 00:31:14,200
right?
So it's like from both sides,

676
00:31:14,201 --> 00:31:15,100
it's like,
what are we doing?

677
00:31:15,101 --> 00:31:18,280
Everyone's burning there Nike's,
but they're actually paying $30,000,000

678
00:31:18,281 --> 00:31:20,290
to rent space and are giving three act.
Right?

679
00:31:20,291 --> 00:31:25,291
They're using sweatshops in China or 
Vietnam or wherever and now suddenly 

680
00:31:25,291 --> 00:31:29,971
everyone on the left school with that 
because they want to support Nike 

681
00:31:29,971 --> 00:31:32,520
because right in the eds,
but also everybody in the right is sort 

682
00:31:32,520 --> 00:31:34,720
of outraged by this move and they're 
burning their shoes.

683
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:39,720
But Nike also was given three act.
It's like let's not look for our moral 

684
00:31:39,720 --> 00:31:40,960
guidance maybe from corporations.
Like maybe that's a good.

685
00:31:40,961 --> 00:31:45,961
So that that's it.
I would say not your moral guidance nor 

686
00:31:45,961 --> 00:31:49,860
from politicians.
I don't think we should be getting it 

687
00:31:49,860 --> 00:31:50,860
from politicians or.
I mean people look at politicians now as

688
00:31:50,861 --> 00:31:55,861
if they're supposed to be superheroes 
and they're just people who are middle 

689
00:31:55,861 --> 00:31:59,290
management pushing things one way or 
another a little bit,

690
00:31:59,380 --> 00:32:04,380
but instead we want people to come in 
with magical powers and fix things that 

691
00:32:04,380 --> 00:32:06,790
haven't been able to be fixed for all of
humanity.

692
00:32:07,370 --> 00:32:12,370
I mean,
I think there are certain standards to 

693
00:32:12,370 --> 00:32:14,110
which we want politicians held.
Like we want doctors and lawyers.

694
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:19,200
There are certain oats of the office.
If someone's life is being run by 

695
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:19,570
lobbyists,
it's like that's a problem,

696
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:21,790
but to go back just real quickly to 
that,

697
00:32:21,880 --> 00:32:24,640
to that concern,
which is if you just close everything,

698
00:32:24,641 --> 00:32:26,600
then people can kind of mob you and 
boycott you,

699
00:32:26,601 --> 00:32:29,980
and we've seen that from both sides in a
way that just becomes a mess.

700
00:32:29,980 --> 00:32:34,980
And then companies like my one of my 
biggest protest actually isn't a moral.

701
00:32:35,350 --> 00:32:40,350
It's that it makes everything boring.
It just makes it so dull that anytime 

702
00:32:40,761 --> 00:32:42,290
somebody takes her,
you're a comedian.

703
00:32:42,291 --> 00:32:44,450
Guests what you live on the edge,
if you live on the edge,

704
00:32:44,451 --> 00:32:49,451
you're going to say stuff.
Sometimes it doesn't play or stuff 

705
00:32:49,451 --> 00:32:49,451
that's offensive.
Look at Richard Pryor.

706
00:32:49,451 --> 00:32:50,480
Look at Eddie Murphy.
Look at Dave Chappelle.

707
00:32:50,870 --> 00:32:55,870
You know you're a comedian.
I mean the whole game is to do that and 

708
00:32:55,870 --> 00:32:59,501
maybe you're going to miss and fall down
and then got a cell phone in the in the 

709
00:32:59,501 --> 00:33:03,521
crowd waiting,
just waiting to click send and then 

710
00:33:03,521 --> 00:33:03,521
there's that word,
craven nonsense.

711
00:33:03,521 --> 00:33:05,570
Apologies to who?
Who is,

712
00:33:05,810 --> 00:33:10,810
who is like curled in a fetal position 
in their shower scrubbing themselves 

713
00:33:10,970 --> 00:33:14,900
because Dave Rubin made a joke that was 
mean about something like I just don't.

714
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:17,030
Who are you,
who do people apologize too?

715
00:33:17,450 --> 00:33:18,500
But so one of the things,
and,

716
00:33:18,501 --> 00:33:21,680
and I know that this is an issue.
I mean this is one of the other things I

717
00:33:21,681 --> 00:33:26,681
know that disclosing is a problem from a
libertarian perspective because why 

718
00:33:26,681 --> 00:33:29,831
shouldn't people just give money and 
let's say that somebody in La and 

719
00:33:29,831 --> 00:33:31,790
they're Christian and they give money to
a pro family,

720
00:33:31,791 --> 00:33:36,791
anti gay marriage group.
It's like maybe they don't want to be 

721
00:33:36,791 --> 00:33:36,791
out and if it means they're never going 
to work again.

722
00:33:36,791 --> 00:33:39,260
Um,
and so I understand those concerns.

723
00:33:39,261 --> 00:33:43,220
And so one of the things that I'm sort 
of discussing and advocating is to raise

724
00:33:43,640 --> 00:33:46,580
the floor of that to some number and I 
don't know what it is,

725
00:33:46,581 --> 00:33:49,220
but these are conversations that are 
being had internally.

726
00:33:49,221 --> 00:33:51,590
And obviously the Democratic Party is 
the one pushing all this.

727
00:33:51,591 --> 00:33:56,591
This is not my invention,
but this is something that I find to be 

728
00:33:56,591 --> 00:33:56,750
important with the candidates who were 
running to talk about,

729
00:33:57,050 --> 00:33:58,730
but maybe there's some floor where we 
say,

730
00:33:58,731 --> 00:33:59,590
look,
5,000

731
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:02,660
or $10,000
give what you want and it's secret,

732
00:34:02,661 --> 00:34:07,661
but if you're giving over $10,000,
you want to be political player and 

733
00:34:07,661 --> 00:34:11,680
maybe have the spine to stand behind 
your money then and I know that that's 

734
00:34:11,680 --> 00:34:14,861
not like I will concede that that is 
running against the current of what a 

735
00:34:14,861 --> 00:34:17,660
libertarian argument would be,
but when I'm weighing that against,

736
00:34:17,690 --> 00:34:20,060
you know,
millions of dark money that no one knows

737
00:34:20,061 --> 00:34:20,660
where it's from.

738
00:34:20,660 --> 00:34:25,660
If it's in the country,
out of the country going up to take out 

739
00:34:25,660 --> 00:34:25,660
candidates.
Like that's,

740
00:34:25,660 --> 00:34:27,470
that's a sacrifice that I'm,
I'm interested in making.

741
00:34:27,480 --> 00:34:32,480
Yeah.
Well that's one of those middle ground 

742
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:32,480
things that I think is worth having the 
conversation about because I don't.

743
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:36,401
I'm not someone that would say there 
should be no government involvement in 

744
00:34:36,401 --> 00:34:36,650
any of their shirt,
so you have to figure out,

745
00:34:36,651 --> 00:34:41,651
all right,
you're going to be a real player in 

746
00:34:41,651 --> 00:34:43,541
this.
Then maybe that does have to disclose 

747
00:34:43,541 --> 00:34:43,541
that.
That actually does make sense to me.

748
00:34:43,541 --> 00:34:45,470
Unfortunately this isn't where you get a
lot of headlines of,

749
00:34:45,471 --> 00:34:50,471
oh,
people are trying to figure out what 

750
00:34:50,471 --> 00:34:52,121
the,
what the fair balances on what to 

751
00:34:52,121 --> 00:34:52,121
disclose,
but wouldn't it be cool?

752
00:34:52,121 --> 00:34:56,530
You know,
it's like we have this thing and it's 

753
00:34:56,530 --> 00:34:56,530
one of the things I talked so much about
messaging.

754
00:34:56,530 --> 00:34:56,930
You walk into a big rally,
you say,

755
00:34:56,931 --> 00:34:59,030
I believe universal healthcare is a 
right.

756
00:34:59,810 --> 00:35:02,470
Everyone's immediately in their camp 
like,

757
00:35:02,510 --> 00:35:04,340
yeah,
and there's cheering and it's wonderful.

758
00:35:04,341 --> 00:35:07,280
Or like there's no way I worked so hard 
my whole life.

759
00:35:07,281 --> 00:35:09,440
I paid for my own healthcare.
Why can't people do it?

760
00:35:09,860 --> 00:35:12,590
And what you just said about there's a 
reasonable ground in the middle.

761
00:35:12,780 --> 00:35:14,780
Um,
and these are conversations I think that

762
00:35:14,781 --> 00:35:16,730
are essential.
It's like everything's in the middle.

763
00:35:16,760 --> 00:35:17,390
It's like,
okay,

764
00:35:17,391 --> 00:35:18,470
well,
you know,

765
00:35:18,830 --> 00:35:23,830
we think everyone should have some 
standard of healthcare so people aren't 

766
00:35:23,830 --> 00:35:24,230
dying in the streets in America,
right?

767
00:35:24,231 --> 00:35:27,860
That's an American and it's unethical.
It's also a massive public health issue.

768
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:31,430
If people just die in their bodies are 
rotting and Mr also paying for it either

769
00:35:31,431 --> 00:35:32,570
way.
Exactly.

770
00:35:33,060 --> 00:35:36,170
So like still it's an economic argument 
like let's not pretend,

771
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:41,200
let's not fight over an abstract notion 
of whether universal healthcare is a 

772
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:43,650
right or a privilege like that doesn't 
actually do anything for people who need

773
00:35:43,660 --> 00:35:44,100
healthcare.

774
00:35:44,460 --> 00:35:46,230
So instead do we look at it and go,
okay,

775
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:50,640
average cost of an emergency room visit 
is $1,233

776
00:35:50,820 --> 00:35:55,820
hospital passes onto an insurance 
company who passes it on to us because 

777
00:35:55,820 --> 00:35:57,840
they're uninsured and our rates go up or
vaccination is $19.

778
00:35:58,290 --> 00:36:03,290
So let's have some dollars and cents 
discussions and let's also talk to 

779
00:36:03,290 --> 00:36:07,011
people from around the table even who we
might disagree with about how we get 

780
00:36:07,011 --> 00:36:11,001
into that.
And it was interesting because I was on 

781
00:36:11,001 --> 00:36:11,730
with Jordan when we jumped on the phone 
with Ben when I was talking through some

782
00:36:11,731 --> 00:36:16,731
of this stuff about like,
like I was trying to figure out if 

783
00:36:16,731 --> 00:36:16,731
there's any good argument for 
gerrymandering.

784
00:36:16,731 --> 00:36:21,470
Aside from the fact that everyone from 
either party just gets to keep their 

785
00:36:21,470 --> 00:36:23,130
jobs.
So why would you literally the points of

786
00:36:23,131 --> 00:36:25,440
interest to me is to call someone like 
you and be like,

787
00:36:25,770 --> 00:36:28,530
make an argument for gerrymandering so I
can know what it is.

788
00:36:28,860 --> 00:36:31,310
And so I was kind of having this 
conversation and,

789
00:36:31,311 --> 00:36:36,311
and you know,
getting pushback from Ben about this 

790
00:36:36,311 --> 00:36:37,620
disclosure thing for exactly the in and 
out reasons and it's like,

791
00:36:37,621 --> 00:36:39,690
okay,
well he and I aren't going to agree,

792
00:36:39,870 --> 00:36:40,650
you know,
it's like he's,

793
00:36:40,710 --> 00:36:45,710
he's gonna see his,
his opinion is get all money out of 

794
00:36:45,710 --> 00:36:45,790
government and then no one's going to 
compete for it.

795
00:36:46,330 --> 00:36:48,480
It's a very different solution to the 
one that I advocate.

796
00:36:48,840 --> 00:36:50,640
But in hearing that I think there's a 
way to,

797
00:36:50,660 --> 00:36:55,660
to address concerns that reasonable 
people will have to say I want to give 

798
00:36:55,660 --> 00:36:56,070
to $2,500
through candidate.

799
00:36:56,071 --> 00:37:01,071
I don't want the whole neighborhood to 
know like what if it's more liberal and 

800
00:37:01,071 --> 00:37:01,071
I'm in Alabama,
right?

801
00:37:01,071 --> 00:37:04,890
What if it's more conservative and I'm 
in San Francisco and so the ways to sort

802
00:37:04,891 --> 00:37:09,120
of hear where people are coming from and
try to figure out ways to discuss that.

803
00:37:09,120 --> 00:37:14,120
And so the biggest hope when you said to
convince me for me is this next 

804
00:37:14,120 --> 00:37:15,690
generation of leadership in the 
Democratic Party.

805
00:37:15,720 --> 00:37:17,220
There is amazing.
You know,

806
00:37:17,221 --> 00:37:22,221
there's a Guy Joseph Kopser in Texas who
20 years he was an army ranger,

807
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:25,200
a professor at West Point,
went to the Kennedy School,

808
00:37:25,201 --> 00:37:27,630
got a degree,
started his own business,

809
00:37:27,890 --> 00:37:32,890
you know,
created hundreds of jobs for people in 

810
00:37:32,890 --> 00:37:32,890
Texas and is now running for a seat.
Interesting guy,

811
00:37:32,890 --> 00:37:35,340
very common sense geared,
goes into churches,

812
00:37:35,341 --> 00:37:40,341
goes into Republican strongholds and 
sits down and we'll have a conversation 

813
00:37:40,341 --> 00:37:41,640
with anybody could sit here and hold his
own with you.

814
00:37:41,670 --> 00:37:46,670
So this does show why the media or the 
way they frame all this is so much of 

815
00:37:46,670 --> 00:37:50,130
the problem because no one has heard of 
any of these people.

816
00:37:50,250 --> 00:37:53,280
And if you control the information that 
we're getting,

817
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:57,600
we're shifting the views on the party.
And I feel the same way an inverse about

818
00:37:57,660 --> 00:37:58,620
trump voters.

819
00:37:58,680 --> 00:38:00,270
Like you're,
you're hearing from them.

820
00:38:00,271 --> 00:38:05,271
And people are saying it's,
it's guys with torches at midnight 

821
00:38:05,271 --> 00:38:05,271
protecting confederate statues.
And it's like,

822
00:38:05,271 --> 00:38:10,191
wait a minute,
I have an incredibly wide array of 

823
00:38:10,191 --> 00:38:12,891
friends.
I have a very broad cross section of 

824
00:38:12,891 --> 00:38:15,321
friends who voted for trump and it's too
widespread for me to dismiss everybody 

825
00:38:15,901 --> 00:38:18,300
as being mouth breathing troglodytes.
There's no way.

826
00:38:18,301 --> 00:38:21,660
I've very smart friends.
I have friends who were in the military,

827
00:38:21,810 --> 00:38:23,700
there are a bunch of people made 
different decisions.

828
00:38:23,701 --> 00:38:28,701
There's people who think that we need 
anything as long as it wasn't another 

829
00:38:28,701 --> 00:38:29,040
Bush or another Clinton,
I don't care what it is.

830
00:38:29,990 --> 00:38:34,990
They wanted a disruption.
And I think that it's really important.

831
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:37,900
Look at the way that the media is 
tailoring that.

832
00:38:37,901 --> 00:38:41,590
And part of what I think our job is are 
people like us,

833
00:38:42,010 --> 00:38:45,940
is to sort of cut through that and to 
try and have a conversation about what's

834
00:38:45,941 --> 00:38:46,900
really going on.

835
00:38:47,110 --> 00:38:48,430
And for me,
with the Democrats,

836
00:38:48,431 --> 00:38:50,020
it's like I can,
as I said,

837
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:53,140
I mean have people sit down or look at 
it,

838
00:38:53,141 --> 00:38:57,760
Angie Craig or Kendra Horn or you know,
can harbaugh's someone I just spoke with

839
00:38:57,761 --> 00:38:58,480
last week,
you know,

840
00:38:58,481 --> 00:39:03,481
another guy was in the military,
didn't emergency relief a organization 

841
00:39:03,481 --> 00:39:05,620
afterwards health 80,000
people like you talk to him.

842
00:39:05,621 --> 00:39:07,690
He's talking about healthcare and jobs 
and education.

843
00:39:07,730 --> 00:39:12,730
And when you say that most of these 
folks are against identity politics and 

844
00:39:12,730 --> 00:39:16,510
just sort of the general state of when 
people talk about the left,

845
00:39:17,410 --> 00:39:19,810
what it's become.
Would you say that they're in opposition

846
00:39:19,811 --> 00:39:23,980
to what I think are most of the 
concerning part of the left?

847
00:39:24,010 --> 00:39:25,540
The concerning parts?
Yes.

848
00:39:25,541 --> 00:39:29,270
I mean what's hard is at least the parts
that we seem to be concerned about,

849
00:39:29,380 --> 00:39:34,380
let's put it that way.
Here's what's hard with identity 

850
00:39:34,380 --> 00:39:36,211
politics is,
it's one of these terms that means very 

851
00:39:36,211 --> 00:39:36,211
different things to different people.

852
00:39:36,211 --> 00:39:39,690
Right?
So some people are like identity and 

853
00:39:39,690 --> 00:39:41,581
that you know,
like I'm African American and have an 

854
00:39:41,581 --> 00:39:44,851
issue with actual statistics on 
imprisonment rates or police brutality 

855
00:39:44,851 --> 00:39:48,960
and ways that that skews is one thing 
saying you can't have cultural 

856
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:52,590
appropriation and I'm melting down over 
white male privilege because you know,

857
00:39:52,630 --> 00:39:57,630
Justin timberlake has a braiding,
his hair is another thing and all of 

858
00:39:57,630 --> 00:40:01,180
those are sort of different and chopped 
up and it's like I like for me,

859
00:40:01,420 --> 00:40:06,420
nobody,
like I haven't had one conversation 

860
00:40:06,420 --> 00:40:09,061
about trans bathrooms or white male 
privilege or any of these things with 

861
00:40:09,061 --> 00:40:12,601
the candidates.
It doesn't mean that they are not more 

862
00:40:12,601 --> 00:40:15,391
inclined based on their political 
orientation and their big five 

863
00:40:15,391 --> 00:40:15,391
personality traits.
Right?

864
00:40:15,391 --> 00:40:19,840
Or empathy,
higher openness to have sympathy for 

865
00:40:19,840 --> 00:40:21,970
those arguments or the arguments that 
are beneath those arguments where people

866
00:40:21,971 --> 00:40:26,971
are coming from.
But the very far left stuff about it 

867
00:40:26,971 --> 00:40:28,630
like a day without white people at 
Evergreen.

868
00:40:28,630 --> 00:40:29,860
Evergreen.
The brass.

869
00:40:30,490 --> 00:40:32,680
No,
I'm not hearing that stuff anywhere.

870
00:40:33,160 --> 00:40:38,160
So it gets a little tricky because for 
me I feel like we can't have it be that 

871
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:41,410
all immigration is bad or all 
integration is good.

872
00:40:41,770 --> 00:40:43,480
Like you were talking about meeting in 
the middle with stuff.

873
00:40:43,481 --> 00:40:48,481
It's like everyone in this country is 
the descendant of an immigrant 

874
00:40:48,481 --> 00:40:48,481
basically.
Yeah.

875
00:40:48,481 --> 00:40:50,050
Unless you were native American or,
or brought here.

876
00:40:50,710 --> 00:40:53,680
And we also can make an argument that 
all immigration is good.

877
00:40:53,770 --> 00:40:58,770
So maybe if we could put down those bats
that were beating each other with and 

878
00:40:59,081 --> 00:41:01,570
actually sit down and talk to what the 
concerns are.

879
00:41:01,840 --> 00:41:05,890
It could be a conversation.
He said something very interesting about

880
00:41:06,280 --> 00:41:08,350
when you were on with banner.
Ben was on with you.

881
00:41:08,351 --> 00:41:13,351
I don't remember.
We were talking about abortion and 

882
00:41:13,351 --> 00:41:13,351
you're,
you're,

883
00:41:13,351 --> 00:41:13,351
you support choice.
Um,

884
00:41:13,351 --> 00:41:17,050
I consider myself begrudgingly pro 
choice and I cut off basically.

885
00:41:17,110 --> 00:41:18,610
Yeah.
But it's like you,

886
00:41:18,640 --> 00:41:23,640
you conceded,
which I thought was really interesting 

887
00:41:23,640 --> 00:41:26,071
because I'm always trying to look at 
this issue and to approach an issue 

888
00:41:26,071 --> 00:41:29,251
that's incredibly emotional with like,
it actually is an issue with very good 

889
00:41:29,251 --> 00:41:33,181
people on both sides.
Well that's the abortion was the most 

890
00:41:33,181 --> 00:41:34,160
interesting to me because it's so 
obvious that sides have

891
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:39,160
a principled position to start.
One doesn't want to control the woman's 

892
00:41:39,160 --> 00:41:39,950
body.
One doesn't want,

893
00:41:40,130 --> 00:41:43,490
one wants to make sure that this child 
is taken care of it and has the right to

894
00:41:43,491 --> 00:41:48,491
life and all that,
so it's like if we can at least 

895
00:41:48,491 --> 00:41:48,491
acknowledge that now we can start 
discussing some of the science,

896
00:41:48,620 --> 00:41:53,620
we can start discussing some of the 
social responsibility of government and 

897
00:41:53,620 --> 00:41:53,620
everything else

898
00:41:53,620 --> 00:41:57,060
before we get into trouble is when we 
impugn the motives of another side 

899
00:41:57,060 --> 00:42:00,330
because nobody knows.
We don't even know our own motives half 

900
00:42:00,330 --> 00:42:00,330
the time.
So for me to say,

901
00:42:00,330 --> 00:42:02,080
you just said that,
let me tell you what your moral failings

902
00:42:02,081 --> 00:42:07,081
are.
Let me tell you where you're not in 

903
00:42:07,081 --> 00:42:07,081
command of your own,
you know,

904
00:42:07,081 --> 00:42:09,530
moral nature to be flawed to make this 
argument right.

905
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:14,760
Anytime we get that from the other 
side's the reaction is obviously like a 

906
00:42:14,760 --> 00:42:15,670
highest men into that.
But what you said that I thought was the

907
00:42:15,671 --> 00:42:17,920
most courageous thing that you said and 
I think it's the.

908
00:42:18,340 --> 00:42:19,600
I think it is the,
it's the,

909
00:42:20,110 --> 00:42:24,400
the tectonic plate under which we can 
sort of build solutions.

910
00:42:24,401 --> 00:42:25,000
As you said,
look,

911
00:42:25,060 --> 00:42:28,600
I can seed that.
Part of my argument is arbitrary.

912
00:42:28,990 --> 00:42:30,070
Like how about,
what'd you say?

913
00:42:30,071 --> 00:42:30,880
Twenty,
20 weeks,

914
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:33,370
so obviously weeks in a day.

915
00:42:33,610 --> 00:42:35,410
How about if she's raped and she's going
to die,

916
00:42:35,411 --> 00:42:38,230
but it's 21 weeks there.
There it is.

917
00:42:38,320 --> 00:42:43,320
We have to concede that we are not 
absolute in our views and some things 

918
00:42:43,361 --> 00:42:48,361
are absolute for people,
but it's like when we're talking about 

919
00:42:48,361 --> 00:42:48,361
immigration,
right?

920
00:42:48,361 --> 00:42:51,340
When we're talking about gun discipline,
it's like there's certain stuff where if

921
00:42:51,341 --> 00:42:54,640
you go in same thing where everyone 
raise your hand who's for gun control?

922
00:42:55,030 --> 00:42:57,280
Everyone's going to immediately go into 
their two camps,

923
00:42:57,281 --> 00:42:58,990
but you can go in and say,
look guys,

924
00:42:59,860 --> 00:43:04,860
politicians and the media always want to
make it seem like this is an all or 

925
00:43:04,860 --> 00:43:05,770
nothing proposition that anything that's
a slippery slope.

926
00:43:05,771 --> 00:43:07,330
We're going to just slide all the way to
the bottom,

927
00:43:07,331 --> 00:43:09,910
right?
If we make any impingement on,

928
00:43:10,210 --> 00:43:15,210
on second amendment rights that 
everyone's going to take our guns away 

929
00:43:15,210 --> 00:43:15,210
and the other side is like,
hey,

930
00:43:15,210 --> 00:43:18,250
anything that you come for me for this,
if I give any ground,

931
00:43:18,251 --> 00:43:23,251
it's going to get worse.
And everybody's really entrenched in 

932
00:43:23,251 --> 00:43:23,420
that and it's like we're already on a 
slippery.

933
00:43:23,760 --> 00:43:28,760
So what do you think we need to break 
that because it seems to me that I'm 

934
00:43:28,760 --> 00:43:33,111
with you.
We've got these two sides kind of going 

935
00:43:33,111 --> 00:43:33,111
and polar opposite directions.
You know,

936
00:43:33,111 --> 00:43:37,431
I've spent more time talking about one 
side that I used to be part of because 

937
00:43:37,431 --> 00:43:37,431
that's where I was.
But I get it.

938
00:43:37,431 --> 00:43:40,340
We've got two sides doing this partially
scoring lover thing to do.

939
00:43:40,490 --> 00:43:41,070
You do that?
Well,

940
00:43:41,160 --> 00:43:42,840
that's why I said mugged left the year 
before.

941
00:43:42,841 --> 00:43:45,270
I think I'm Bret Weinstein said that I 
have,

942
00:43:45,300 --> 00:43:47,490
I have ptsd basically,
but whatever,

943
00:43:47,640 --> 00:43:48,750
whatever it is you,
you,

944
00:43:48,780 --> 00:43:50,110
you,
when you're a part of something,

945
00:43:50,140 --> 00:43:52,290
you can recognize it there.
And look,

946
00:43:52,291 --> 00:43:57,291
if 10 years from now,
if I'm hanging out with all these 

947
00:43:57,291 --> 00:43:58,100
libertarians and they're all crazy,
I'll,

948
00:43:58,260 --> 00:43:59,370
I'll call them out.
You know what I mean?

949
00:43:59,371 --> 00:44:01,080
Like I just think it's just human 
nature.

950
00:44:01,081 --> 00:44:03,270
You can go to what you know and where 
you were.

951
00:44:04,200 --> 00:44:06,690
It's almost like we need something crazy
to happen.

952
00:44:06,691 --> 00:44:08,580
I don't even know what I mean by this.
Exactly.

953
00:44:08,581 --> 00:44:11,580
To break this thing,
we can talk about it rationally,

954
00:44:11,581 --> 00:44:16,581
right.
And the whole idw crew can talk about 

955
00:44:16,581 --> 00:44:16,581
how to have these conversations and 
agree to disagree and I,

956
00:44:16,581 --> 00:44:17,800
you know,
ben and the,

957
00:44:17,850 --> 00:44:22,850
the gay cake and all that.
Like I can try to hopefully he'll make 

958
00:44:22,850 --> 00:44:24,390
me a cake one day now that I think he's 
in particularly good baker,

959
00:44:24,540 --> 00:44:26,670
but like we can do that for the next 50 
years,

960
00:44:26,671 --> 00:44:31,671
that discussion.
But it almost seems to me we're on this 

961
00:44:31,671 --> 00:44:32,130
like slide to something

962
00:44:32,130 --> 00:44:33,810
really horrible.
Is gonna happen.

963
00:44:33,860 --> 00:44:35,940
I again,
I don't know exactly what I mean,

964
00:44:36,150 --> 00:44:38,400
but it's like what would it take to wake
people up to this?

965
00:44:38,401 --> 00:44:42,180
We're all talking about it and no one's 
actually stopping it from happening.

966
00:44:42,750 --> 00:44:47,750
Well,
the inevitable descent I think in a 

967
00:44:47,750 --> 00:44:49,620
weird way when everyone's looking at the
sort of trump phenomenon,

968
00:44:49,650 --> 00:44:54,650
right?
Which came out of nowhere seemingly but 

969
00:44:54,650 --> 00:44:58,470
really didn't part of the vote for him 
and for you know,

970
00:44:58,471 --> 00:45:03,471
a 70 something year old democratic 
socialist from Vermont I think was that.

971
00:45:03,541 --> 00:45:08,541
I think it was a reaction to that.
The people said the status quo isn't 

972
00:45:08,541 --> 00:45:10,350
going to work anymore.
Like I said,

973
00:45:10,440 --> 00:45:15,440
I don't care who it is,
it's not going to be another Bush 

974
00:45:15,440 --> 00:45:15,440
Clinton,
and you know,

975
00:45:15,440 --> 00:45:19,371
I might,
I might disagree with the choices that 

976
00:45:19,371 --> 00:45:22,191
some people made,
but I can't disagree with the driving 

977
00:45:23,250 --> 00:45:25,380
anger and frustration that underlay 
that.

978
00:45:25,400 --> 00:45:25,880
And,
and you know,

979
00:45:25,920 --> 00:45:30,270
Eric talks about the sort of three big 
lies that have been put forth,

980
00:45:30,271 --> 00:45:32,100
you know,
one is that all immigration is good,

981
00:45:32,820 --> 00:45:37,820
right?
The other is that would trade a rising 

982
00:45:37,820 --> 00:45:40,731
tide lifts all ships.
The third is that there is zero 

983
00:45:40,731 --> 00:45:41,670
connection whatsoever between terrorism 
and Islam,

984
00:45:41,760 --> 00:45:44,940
that they're totally unhooked.
I add a fourth though,

985
00:45:44,941 --> 00:45:48,510
Eric thinks it's less relevant,
but I think that it's the argument that,

986
00:45:48,560 --> 00:45:53,560
um,
that biology has no basis whatsoever in 

987
00:45:53,560 --> 00:45:53,730
gender definition or in,
in,

988
00:45:53,760 --> 00:45:55,290
you know,
sexuality,

989
00:45:55,291 --> 00:45:56,070
that there's,
that there's,

990
00:45:56,071 --> 00:45:57,830
that,
that seems like a huge one these days.

991
00:45:57,930 --> 00:46:00,660
Mean Eric believes that that's less wide
spread.

992
00:46:00,661 --> 00:46:05,661
But I think that culturally that,
that position is so weaponizing that I 

993
00:46:06,241 --> 00:46:10,530
think that that's an equivalent one.
And I think that what you're seeing is a

994
00:46:10,531 --> 00:46:15,531
reaction to these absolutes that 
everybody knows that a gut level aren't 

995
00:46:15,531 --> 00:46:17,370
true and it's like everybody's 
entertaining them on the surface.

996
00:46:17,370 --> 00:46:19,500
Everybody's having a conversation,
which is,

997
00:46:19,800 --> 00:46:24,800
you know,
I believe only an open borders or I 

998
00:46:24,800 --> 00:46:24,800
believe we have to shut down borders 
and,

999
00:46:24,800 --> 00:46:27,150
and separate families.
And then it's like,

1000
00:46:27,210 --> 00:46:32,210
these polls are so crazy and I think 
that they're both groups are motivated 

1001
00:46:32,461 --> 00:46:37,461
to protect their further left or right 
compatriots.

1002
00:46:37,710 --> 00:46:42,710
I mean,
so we're having this movement that's 

1003
00:46:42,710 --> 00:46:44,361
going out in that direction.
But I think that's what it was a 

1004
00:46:44,361 --> 00:46:44,361
reaction to.
And I think you're saying,

1005
00:46:44,361 --> 00:46:45,150
look,
where's the point of the Big Bang theory

1006
00:46:45,151 --> 00:46:46,120
that the university,
you know,

1007
00:46:46,290 --> 00:46:51,290
explodes that it starts to come back 
together and because I'm afraid it's 

1008
00:46:51,290 --> 00:46:51,450
going to have to take something 
horrible.

1009
00:46:51,451 --> 00:46:52,530
And again,
I don't even know what I mean.

1010
00:46:53,010 --> 00:46:58,010
Is there going to be like some 
terrorists deck or something that will 

1011
00:46:58,010 --> 00:46:59,910
just remind us that these people are not
all of our enemies.

1012
00:47:00,180 --> 00:47:00,840
You know what I mean?

1013
00:47:00,840 --> 00:47:05,840
Like it's like,
I don't want to think of the world that 

1014
00:47:05,840 --> 00:47:07,811
you were saying essentially what that 
thesis is to say if there's a horrible 

1015
00:47:07,811 --> 00:47:11,370
terrorist attack,
the new sort of outgroup threat will get

1016
00:47:11,371 --> 00:47:15,480
Americans back together because nobody 
wants that to happen of course.

1017
00:47:15,481 --> 00:47:20,481
And there's huge danger and what that 
ends up leading to because we know how 

1018
00:47:20,481 --> 00:47:22,170
we sort of went crazy after nine slash 
11 and the Patriot Act and all that.

1019
00:47:22,470 --> 00:47:25,650
But like it just seems to me that the,
the wheels on this thing,

1020
00:47:25,830 --> 00:47:28,050
although now people are talking about 
it,

1021
00:47:28,051 --> 00:47:32,350
it's not slowing down and that just 
leads me to believe it gets to the ledge

1022
00:47:33,010 --> 00:47:35,400
to.
Well I think the first thing is,

1023
00:47:35,430 --> 00:47:37,630
is you know,
like clean up your own kitchen first.

1024
00:47:37,631 --> 00:47:39,580
I mean that's what I'm doing.
If the guy that I'm on tour with,

1025
00:47:39,581 --> 00:47:40,930
it's doing something about cleaning up 
your own.

1026
00:47:41,940 --> 00:47:43,520
But see I switched into kitchen.
That was.

1027
00:47:43,530 --> 00:47:44,380
No,
that was effective.

1028
00:47:44,381 --> 00:47:45,670
It's yours.
Jordan got everything.

1029
00:47:45,671 --> 00:47:48,880
He knows I'm boiling.
Wait,

1030
00:47:48,881 --> 00:47:53,881
let's pause there for a second.
Just real quick because we shouldn't 

1031
00:47:53,881 --> 00:47:53,881
have totally dismissed this.
So you were in Jordan student?

1032
00:47:54,180 --> 00:47:54,740
I was,
what,

1033
00:47:54,750 --> 00:47:55,570
what was that like?
Well,

1034
00:47:55,600 --> 00:48:00,600
we'll get back there,
but let's just not because I wanted to 

1035
00:48:00,600 --> 00:48:00,600
do it like 20 minutes ago and Jordan was
amazing.

1036
00:48:00,600 --> 00:48:02,230
I mean,
I love Jordan from minute one.

1037
00:48:02,480 --> 00:48:03,530
He taught me,
um,

1038
00:48:03,580 --> 00:48:08,580
personality psychology.
I went back into the young seminar with 

1039
00:48:08,580 --> 00:48:09,010
him and then he was,
my thesis advisor is like,

1040
00:48:09,011 --> 00:48:09,850
what?
Mid Nineties?

1041
00:48:09,851 --> 00:48:12,880
Early nineties.
I graduated in 95 and he was dynamite.

1042
00:48:12,881 --> 00:48:16,540
He was very imposing and formal.
I just like,

1043
00:48:16,541 --> 00:48:17,930
right away was,
was,

1044
00:48:18,150 --> 00:48:23,150
was like I just got to solve the whole 
thing and I remember telling my college 

1045
00:48:23,150 --> 00:48:23,890
roommates,
I was like,

1046
00:48:23,891 --> 00:48:26,980
that's a guy who's going to be 
remembered just by his last name,

1047
00:48:27,430 --> 00:48:30,080
like Hundred Years after his dad and you
know,

1048
00:48:30,100 --> 00:48:31,960
I didn't quite think it was because he 
was going to be doing,

1049
00:48:32,020 --> 00:48:33,250
you know,
kermit the frog.

1050
00:48:33,250 --> 00:48:34,820
Hitler means.
But like whatever.

1051
00:48:35,250 --> 00:48:37,480
I mean I just thought in an academic 
arena.

1052
00:48:37,510 --> 00:48:39,880
Yeah,
he's sort of brilliance for me was.

1053
00:48:39,930 --> 00:48:42,430
And his pattern recognition and ability 
to boil stuff down.

1054
00:48:42,820 --> 00:48:47,820
But he would even then,
if somebody came in ideologically from 

1055
00:48:47,820 --> 00:48:50,050
the left or the right and it was kind of
a hollow shell,

1056
00:48:50,140 --> 00:48:53,020
he would just puncture it,
didn't have as much of a,

1057
00:48:53,021 --> 00:48:54,130
of a,
of.

1058
00:48:54,550 --> 00:48:56,990
He was formidable.
I mean he wasn't as joking.

1059
00:48:57,040 --> 00:48:58,990
I mean obviously we're,
we're good friends now,

1060
00:48:59,440 --> 00:49:00,820
but he was,
you know,

1061
00:49:00,880 --> 00:49:02,680
he could be intimidating to other 
people,

1062
00:49:02,681 --> 00:49:06,610
but I always just really liked him.
And then we stayed in touch after that.

1063
00:49:06,611 --> 00:49:11,611
He was my thesis advisor.
We're very close and then he officiated 

1064
00:49:11,611 --> 00:49:11,611
my wedding.
So I,

1065
00:49:11,611 --> 00:49:13,930
I'm the only person on record to have a 
wedding that like sites extensively from

1066
00:49:13,940 --> 00:49:14,630
Canaan,
evil,

1067
00:49:15,790 --> 00:49:19,390
everyone,
I assume the Gulag archipelago needs.

1068
00:49:19,930 --> 00:49:23,110
We had little like Gulag archipelago,
like table settings.

1069
00:49:23,480 --> 00:49:28,480
No,
but at one point my wife and I just re 

1070
00:49:28,480 --> 00:49:29,760
watched our wedding video was so funny 
and she's looking and you know,

1071
00:49:29,800 --> 00:49:33,260
she adores Jordan to and Jordan was 
going off about something and she,

1072
00:49:33,490 --> 00:49:38,490
she's looking up at me and she's in her 
dress like where that moment at the 

1073
00:49:38,490 --> 00:49:38,490
altar.
And she said,

1074
00:49:38,490 --> 00:49:42,031
this is the part where I wasn't sure if 
I was getting married or being treated 

1075
00:49:42,031 --> 00:49:45,370
like they're Jordan did a whole 
archetypical analysis and then,

1076
00:49:45,371 --> 00:49:45,790
you know,
look,

1077
00:49:45,791 --> 00:49:49,090
I put his rules for life in orphan acts 
as a,

1078
00:49:49,120 --> 00:49:54,120
as a I have like the assassins 10 
commandments and I wanted to actually 

1079
00:49:54,120 --> 00:49:55,420
good rules that,
that someone could be raised by.

1080
00:49:55,660 --> 00:49:56,890
And then I helped him,
you know,

1081
00:49:57,040 --> 00:50:01,090
edit the book and work on the book from 
the early stage.

1082
00:50:01,091 --> 00:50:03,940
So I read it and had an orphan x three 
years before his book came out.

1083
00:50:03,970 --> 00:50:05,890
So when you,
when you say that when people would come

1084
00:50:05,891 --> 00:50:08,680
in with arguments from either side and 
he could just pop them just like that.

1085
00:50:08,681 --> 00:50:11,890
That's one of the most interesting 
things to me because if you listen again

1086
00:50:11,891 --> 00:50:14,440
to what mainstream is saying about him 
is that he's this,

1087
00:50:14,470 --> 00:50:19,470
he's this ultra conservative or this 
forest monogamy or he doesn't like gay 

1088
00:50:19,901 --> 00:50:22,000
people are just like any of this 
nonsense.

1089
00:50:22,001 --> 00:50:25,630
Which every night I hear him go up there
and beat these arguments down.

1090
00:50:25,631 --> 00:50:28,100
He beats down the arguments of identity

1091
00:50:28,100 --> 00:50:29,360
politics on the right.
I mean,

1092
00:50:29,361 --> 00:50:34,361
he's literally,
every criticism of him is like the 

1093
00:50:34,361 --> 00:50:37,421
reverse of what he's actually doing 
doesn't mean he's right about 

1094
00:50:37,421 --> 00:50:37,421
everything,
but it's not,

1095
00:50:37,421 --> 00:50:38,660
you know,
everyone is deserving of criticism,

1096
00:50:38,661 --> 00:50:43,661
but it should be legit criticism.
So it must infuriate you when you read 

1097
00:50:43,661 --> 00:50:45,320
some of these things about him knowing 
that,

1098
00:50:45,540 --> 00:50:46,440
you know,
this is,

1099
00:50:46,470 --> 00:50:47,690
this isn't the guy that you learned 
here.

1100
00:50:47,740 --> 00:50:52,740
Yeah.
And you meanwhile he brings like a gay 

1101
00:50:52,740 --> 00:50:53,350
guy on tour with him.
He's a crazy Christian homophone.

1102
00:50:53,360 --> 00:50:54,220
Yeah.
So,

1103
00:50:54,221 --> 00:50:55,240
I mean,
one of the jokes I have,

1104
00:50:55,241 --> 00:50:58,890
he got accused of being an antisemite at
some point and um,

1105
00:50:59,050 --> 00:51:01,250
it was so great.
Eric and I were talking about this and I

1106
00:51:01,310 --> 00:51:02,500
think I tweeted,
I'm like,

1107
00:51:02,501 --> 00:51:03,460
boy,
you know,

1108
00:51:03,461 --> 00:51:08,461
Jordan did a terrible job covering up 
his antisemitism when he officiated my 

1109
00:51:08,461 --> 00:51:12,451
wedding 15 years ago.
Most incompetent anti-semite I've ever 

1110
00:51:12,451 --> 00:51:12,451
met.
Um,

1111
00:51:12,520 --> 00:51:14,110
you know,
it's more infuriating for me.

1112
00:51:14,190 --> 00:51:19,190
I,
I feel like the media skew is so 

1113
00:51:19,190 --> 00:51:20,310
complicated.
I've almost given up on us in,

1114
00:51:20,330 --> 00:51:22,240
in certain ways.
I look,

1115
00:51:22,241 --> 00:51:25,060
I think the media has done an amazingly 
impressive stuff.

1116
00:51:25,090 --> 00:51:30,090
Like I'm,
I'm a big fan of the Washington Post 

1117
00:51:30,090 --> 00:51:31,060
despite how some things have gone,
so it's like I'm not,

1118
00:51:31,061 --> 00:51:32,230
I'm not giving up on that.

1119
00:51:32,230 --> 00:51:37,230
I don't.
I believe that the media is doing a 

1120
00:51:37,230 --> 00:51:38,260
really good job on cultural issues.
I'm accustomed to it when people come in

1121
00:51:38,261 --> 00:51:42,070
and attack Jordan for being right.
It's like there is a video online of him

1122
00:51:42,071 --> 00:51:45,700
denouncing the alt right for an hour if 
you bothered to look into it.

1123
00:51:46,300 --> 00:51:51,300
The thing that infuriates me more 
seemingly intelligent intellectual 

1124
00:51:51,300 --> 00:51:55,531
people who will dismiss him or get 
nervous if I bring his name up based on 

1125
00:51:55,531 --> 00:51:58,900
anything that is wildly taken out of 
context.

1126
00:51:58,960 --> 00:52:00,820
And with Jordan it's like,
look,

1127
00:52:00,821 --> 00:52:03,700
I was a student.
I've known him a lot of years.

1128
00:52:03,701 --> 00:52:08,701
I've seen hundreds and hundreds of hours
of his lectures both in school and here.

1129
00:52:09,070 --> 00:52:09,580
You know,
I,

1130
00:52:09,590 --> 00:52:14,590
I helped him with his book when he was 
going through the book and he makes fun 

1131
00:52:14,590 --> 00:52:18,361
of me for that and the acknowledgements.
There's nothing that he has said that I.

1132
00:52:19,830 --> 00:52:22,330
I mean I know his work about as well as 
anyone could.

1133
00:52:22,450 --> 00:52:25,360
There's not a single thing that he said 
that if you don't contextualize,

1134
00:52:25,361 --> 00:52:28,900
it doesn't actually make sense and I 
have people wholesale say,

1135
00:52:28,901 --> 00:52:30,580
Oh,
well I have my feelings about that.

1136
00:52:30,670 --> 00:52:31,810
It's like,
you know,

1137
00:52:32,020 --> 00:52:37,020
I,
I'll mentioned doing something with him 

1138
00:52:37,020 --> 00:52:37,020
and people who are,
who are seemingly academic and I'll say,

1139
00:52:37,020 --> 00:52:37,480
did you read the book

1140
00:52:37,970 --> 00:52:42,970
just,
is that just the plight of doing 

1141
00:52:42,970 --> 00:52:42,970
something that is something close to 
true?

1142
00:52:42,970 --> 00:52:45,530
I mean when I'm out there with him every
night and he changes the speed,

1143
00:52:45,531 --> 00:52:46,640
you know,
he does an hour and a half.

1144
00:52:46,880 --> 00:52:47,750
I'm warm.
The crowd up.

1145
00:52:47,751 --> 00:52:50,420
He does an hour and a half and then we 
do like 40 minutes together at the end,

1146
00:52:50,690 --> 00:52:52,790
but that hour and a half he does.
He changes it every night.

1147
00:52:52,791 --> 00:52:56,900
I see him searching for truth every 
night and it's like,

1148
00:52:57,110 --> 00:53:02,110
well actually all this hatred and all of
that non contextualized stuff that 

1149
00:53:02,110 --> 00:53:06,101
you're talking about is just,
that's just the shitty part of doing 

1150
00:53:06,101 --> 00:53:06,620
something good.
Right.

1151
00:53:06,710 --> 00:53:11,710
Maybe like,
isn't that if you were writing the 

1152
00:53:11,710 --> 00:53:13,511
character,
wouldn't you be doing dealing with all 

1153
00:53:13,511 --> 00:53:13,511
this?
It's so interesting.

1154
00:53:13,511 --> 00:53:13,511
So.
All right,

1155
00:53:13,511 --> 00:53:16,490
so two things like who's gonna say 
something true and then it's going to be

1156
00:53:16,491 --> 00:53:17,930
all good.
Everybody's going to love him.

1157
00:53:18,120 --> 00:53:20,630
I like it.
Worked out for Jesus.

1158
00:53:20,631 --> 00:53:24,300
Didn't work out that well for the earth 
isn't the center right,

1159
00:53:25,550 --> 00:53:29,160
so I was thinking that brought up two 
kind of ideas for me.

1160
00:53:29,161 --> 00:53:34,161
I mean one of them is people who were 
seemingly academic and intelligent and 

1161
00:53:34,161 --> 00:53:37,701
pride themselves on being cerebral.
It's like how dare you denigrate him 

1162
00:53:37,701 --> 00:53:42,391
because you read an unflattering profile
and not read a book or listen to a 

1163
00:53:42,391 --> 00:53:45,300
lecture or do any research beyond that,
but they got it in the New York Times.

1164
00:53:45,740 --> 00:53:47,040
Well,
right.

1165
00:53:47,130 --> 00:53:52,130
I mean or in any host of other places 
that have missed the mark and then the 

1166
00:53:52,130 --> 00:53:52,200
New York Times will come around and do 
something flattering.

1167
00:53:52,440 --> 00:53:57,440
I mean a profiles,
a profile and they take a point of view 

1168
00:53:57,440 --> 00:54:00,110
but like dig deeper.
But what's so interesting is you were 

1169
00:54:00,110 --> 00:54:04,341
just talking about that and that it is 
such a cool thing to watch him just like

1170
00:54:04,411 --> 00:54:09,411
you're watching somebody grappling with 
issues when he's on stage and you've 

1171
00:54:09,411 --> 00:54:09,411
watched him do that a lot.

1172
00:54:09,690 --> 00:54:12,960
It reminds me a bit of like the,
the abstract expressionists.

1173
00:54:12,961 --> 00:54:17,961
I was just thinking like we're,
we're pollock started to say the act of 

1174
00:54:17,961 --> 00:54:18,660
creation is a triumph,
right?

1175
00:54:18,661 --> 00:54:21,630
So what I'm going to paint something,
you're going to see my brush stroke,

1176
00:54:21,631 --> 00:54:26,631
right,
that's laid on on canvas and of course 

1177
00:54:26,631 --> 00:54:29,631
linkedin.
She did a great kind of piss take on 

1178
00:54:29,631 --> 00:54:30,000
that where he did like a carefully 
painted cartoon version of that.

1179
00:54:30,390 --> 00:54:35,390
But where you really are seeing the work
and that the work is what is the 

1180
00:54:35,390 --> 00:54:39,161
abstract expressionists really sort of 
put the art world on their head by 

1181
00:54:39,161 --> 00:54:42,720
elevating the form and the function for 
like the heroism of the crater.

1182
00:54:43,160 --> 00:54:44,580
So it's sort of interesting because I 
haven't,

1183
00:54:44,581 --> 00:54:46,860
I,
I've noted of course that he's grappling

1184
00:54:46,861 --> 00:54:49,410
with things and part of him thinking 
about is what's appealing.

1185
00:54:49,590 --> 00:54:51,660
Like the thing that I said that I keyed 
to with you is saying,

1186
00:54:51,661 --> 00:54:56,661
look,
part of my argument for pro choice is 

1187
00:54:56,661 --> 00:54:56,661
arbitrary.

1188
00:54:56,661 --> 00:54:56,670
It has to be we're so used to not 
conceding any of that,

1189
00:54:57,060 --> 00:55:00,840
so to see somebody stand up in front of 
3000 people and go hang on,

1190
00:55:01,470 --> 00:55:06,470
like,
and really be reasoning with that in a 

1191
00:55:06,470 --> 00:55:08,751
way that you might reach in a bag and 
come up with nothing is compelling and 

1192
00:55:08,751 --> 00:55:12,351
there's something heroic about that.
The way the Jackson pollock was 

1193
00:55:12,351 --> 00:55:16,670
portraying.
So as a writer you want to create 

1194
00:55:16,670 --> 00:55:18,891
characters that show vulnerability 
because it shows that they're human and 

1195
00:55:18,891 --> 00:55:22,491
yet we seem to operate in a time when 
almost no one is showing vulnerability 

1196
00:55:22,711 --> 00:55:25,170
outwardly.
Our politicians don't want to show it or

1197
00:55:25,440 --> 00:55:27,310
media people like everyone wants to be 
perfect every,

1198
00:55:27,330 --> 00:55:32,330
all the virtue signaling these days.
Everyone wants to be like this perfect 

1199
00:55:32,330 --> 00:55:34,320
thing.
So then you get the few people that show

1200
00:55:34,321 --> 00:55:37,230
a little vulnerability and I guess that 
has a little extra value.

1201
00:55:37,830 --> 00:55:39,750
Hmm,
that's a good point.

1202
00:55:40,140 --> 00:55:42,270
I mean we tend to question there,
just the point.

1203
00:55:42,690 --> 00:55:44,130
Yeah.
Well I see.

1204
00:55:44,160 --> 00:55:47,550
It's interesting because we see a lot of
photo vulnerability,

1205
00:55:47,970 --> 00:55:50,580
right?
Like when it's masking virtue signaling,

1206
00:55:50,610 --> 00:55:53,670
like I've been thinking about this other
notion that I have,

1207
00:55:53,671 --> 00:55:54,570
which is,
you know,

1208
00:55:54,571 --> 00:55:56,310
in writing,
because it's sort of like why am I doing

1209
00:55:56,311 --> 00:55:57,690
all this stuff and politics,
right?

1210
00:55:57,691 --> 00:55:58,650
Like,
nothing makes sense.

1211
00:55:58,651 --> 00:56:00,210
So I looked back on,
like when I was like,

1212
00:56:00,211 --> 00:56:01,200
why would I study,
you know,

1213
00:56:01,201 --> 00:56:02,910
shakespearian tragedy,
young and Freud,

1214
00:56:02,911 --> 00:56:03,780
and it's like,
oh,

1215
00:56:03,870 --> 00:56:05,430
that's,
that's thrillers,

1216
00:56:05,431 --> 00:56:06,780
right?
That's everything that I love.

1217
00:56:07,260 --> 00:56:09,330
But likewise with politics,
it's like when you're writing,

1218
00:56:09,331 --> 00:56:11,460
well,
what you want to avoid is cliche.

1219
00:56:12,030 --> 00:56:17,030
Like it's like your podcast,
like what you don't want to do is do 

1220
00:56:17,030 --> 00:56:17,030
like whatever,
what you're supposed to say,

1221
00:56:17,030 --> 00:56:21,651
everything about you and what you do is 
not saying what everyone else says and 

1222
00:56:21,651 --> 00:56:23,010
not lowering yourself to cliche.

1223
00:56:23,020 --> 00:56:23,820
So in books,
you,

1224
00:56:23,821 --> 00:56:25,450
you,
that's what you search for,

1225
00:56:25,451 --> 00:56:27,280
right?
If there's an obvious plot turn right,

1226
00:56:27,281 --> 00:56:28,990
you have the cops sitting outside of the
guy being like,

1227
00:56:28,991 --> 00:56:32,830
this is my last day till retirement and 
I'm going to buy a yacht and sail around

1228
00:56:32,831 --> 00:56:33,430
the world.
You're like,

1229
00:56:33,431 --> 00:56:38,431
that guy's getting killed,
like everything we try and do is avoid 

1230
00:56:38,431 --> 00:56:38,431
that.
Yeah.

1231
00:56:38,431 --> 00:56:42,240
So in politics,
so much of what I'm doing is trying to 

1232
00:56:42,240 --> 00:56:44,791
make people speak humanly and to avoid 
buzzwords and so it's like I have this 

1233
00:56:44,831 --> 00:56:47,050
theory that like as soon as you talk 
about,

1234
00:56:47,410 --> 00:56:52,410
you know,
a woman's right to choose that doesn't 

1235
00:56:52,410 --> 00:56:54,160
feel like it's sufficiently complex and 
motivated.

1236
00:56:54,161 --> 00:56:57,610
I understand people need to,
we need to gravitate with shorthand.

1237
00:56:58,090 --> 00:57:00,880
But like I remember growing up in the 
Reagan era family of like,

1238
00:57:00,881 --> 00:57:05,881
you know,
we were the only Jews in Saratoga and 

1239
00:57:05,881 --> 00:57:08,971
Silicon Valley in my neighborhood at the
time and the only people who voted 

1240
00:57:08,971 --> 00:57:08,971
Democrat,
you know,

1241
00:57:08,971 --> 00:57:11,380
it was early days of Silicon Valley,
so diverse now,

1242
00:57:11,381 --> 00:57:16,381
but that was all the,
like Hewlett Packard engineers who look 

1243
00:57:16,381 --> 00:57:17,320
like the launch guys from NASA,
the glasses and the pocket protector.

1244
00:57:17,570 --> 00:57:19,290
It was just,
it was totally geared that way.

1245
00:57:19,300 --> 00:57:21,310
Retail is not thrilled with the 
diversity in silicon valley,

1246
00:57:21,311 --> 00:57:22,870
but that's a different issue.
Dot Okay.

1247
00:57:23,020 --> 00:57:23,750
Yeah.
Well,

1248
00:57:23,860 --> 00:57:25,360
he's not thrilled with the diversity of 
thought,

1249
00:57:25,390 --> 00:57:27,940
but you were talking about the 
university is getting code of thought.

1250
00:57:28,360 --> 00:57:29,740
Where was.
I lost my thread.

1251
00:57:30,830 --> 00:57:32,890
You guys were the outliers when you were
growing up there.

1252
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:39,000
Oh right.
And so everybody was talking about 

1253
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:40,741
family values.
That was a big political thing from the 

1254
00:57:40,741 --> 00:57:41,020
rice and I'm sure you had a bit of a 
reaction to that too,

1255
00:57:41,021 --> 00:57:46,021
of like,
well I want to talk about family values 

1256
00:57:46,021 --> 00:57:48,570
and I just felt like,
what do you feel like it's such a 

1257
00:57:48,570 --> 00:57:48,790
Republican word that coded for all this 
stuff for me?

1258
00:57:48,791 --> 00:57:50,350
And I was naturally very resistant to 
it.

1259
00:57:50,351 --> 00:57:51,490
So then I grew up,
I get married,

1260
00:57:51,491 --> 00:57:52,900
I have two kids and I'm like,
Hey,

1261
00:57:52,901 --> 00:57:53,500
wait a minute.

1262
00:57:53,500 --> 00:57:55,510
I should have family values,
family values.

1263
00:57:55,630 --> 00:58:00,630
Like I like this new light because the 
word was co-opted as a catchphrase and 

1264
00:58:00,630 --> 00:58:05,011
when Republicans were using it,
there it one time it had a rich and body

1265
00:58:06,430 --> 00:58:11,430
of meaning.
But when it's used again and again and 

1266
00:58:11,430 --> 00:58:12,010
again and again in a campaign,
it loses all the life to it.

1267
00:58:12,040 --> 00:58:14,380
And the same thing happens with liberal 
slogans.

1268
00:58:14,740 --> 00:58:19,740
And so it's almost like the process of 
compressing information into newsworthy 

1269
00:58:19,740 --> 00:58:24,720
soundbites and using phrases and catch 
phrases the further you are from genuine

1270
00:58:25,510 --> 00:58:30,510
or authentic thought and it's a very 
similar thing of where you're trying to 

1271
00:58:30,510 --> 00:58:33,910
reach in and do things differently in 
novels or in screenwriting or Comex,

1272
00:58:34,560 --> 00:58:36,490
um,
is very similar thing to the stage.

1273
00:58:36,491 --> 00:58:41,491
It's like,
don't just shovel out a bunch of 

1274
00:58:41,491 --> 00:58:41,491
cliches.
Like,

1275
00:58:41,491 --> 00:58:44,520
oh,
Democrats are all for redistribution of 

1276
00:58:44,520 --> 00:58:44,520
wealth.
It's like,

1277
00:58:44,520 --> 00:58:44,520
no,
that's not what all democrats are for.

1278
00:58:44,520 --> 00:58:45,930
Republicans are all,
you know,

1279
00:58:45,960 --> 00:58:47,770
racist and scared of outsiders.
It's like,

1280
00:58:47,771 --> 00:58:49,630
no,
that's not what all Republicans are.

1281
00:58:49,990 --> 00:58:53,410
And so the more that we hear things that
we've heard again and again and again,

1282
00:58:53,411 --> 00:58:58,411
the further we're off the mark,
and maybe that's why this expansive 

1283
00:58:58,411 --> 00:58:58,660
format you know,
is,

1284
00:58:58,690 --> 00:59:01,630
is what's leading to more complicated 
things because we're not,

1285
00:59:01,690 --> 00:59:06,250
we don't have two minutes to just sort 
of hurl the cliches at each other.

1286
00:59:06,670 --> 00:59:10,540
So if I'm,
if we're looking forward a little bit to

1287
00:59:10,541 --> 00:59:13,420
the elections that are about to happen,
these midterms now,

1288
00:59:13,421 --> 00:59:16,090
it seems to me that for,
for the decent Democrats,

1289
00:59:16,120 --> 00:59:21,120
trying to retain some of what old 
liberalism and old democratic messaging 

1290
00:59:21,120 --> 00:59:25,900
was,
there's a really tough position here 

1291
00:59:25,900 --> 00:59:26,240
because it seems to me that if the 
Democrats win,

1292
00:59:26,480 --> 00:59:29,600
it means that the further left wing of 
the party wins right now.

1293
00:59:29,920 --> 00:59:31,760
Is that,
is that a fair estimation?

1294
00:59:31,780 --> 00:59:33,340
I don't know.
I don't think that's right.

1295
00:59:33,350 --> 00:59:35,870
So because you think that these sort of 
unknown people.

1296
00:59:36,340 --> 00:59:37,420
Yeah.
People.

1297
00:59:37,510 --> 00:59:42,510
I mean,
so it's like tell me the candidates who 

1298
00:59:42,510 --> 00:59:43,280
you know,
to be hardcore laugh.

1299
00:59:43,310 --> 00:59:45,410
Well here's the reason I'm asking you is
that if,

1300
00:59:45,470 --> 00:59:48,380
if the argument is that these far left,
these are going to win.

1301
00:59:48,740 --> 00:59:51,950
Well then there's no reason to have a 
reformation of the Democratic Party.

1302
00:59:51,951 --> 00:59:52,760
They're going to go,
all right,

1303
00:59:52,761 --> 00:59:53,900
Greg Sia,
you know,

1304
00:59:53,901 --> 00:59:54,920
our far left.
He's one.

1305
00:59:55,430 --> 01:00:00,430
If the Republicans win and then that 
sort of far left thing implodes,

1306
01:00:00,890 --> 01:00:03,320
then there's a huge amount of space for 
you.

1307
01:00:04,050 --> 01:00:09,050
If you're,
if what you're saying is there is this 

1308
01:00:09,050 --> 01:00:11,531
huge groundswell of people that nobody's
heard of who are more moderate sort of 

1309
01:00:11,531 --> 01:00:13,400
blue dog,
they're rejecting some of this socialism

1310
01:00:13,401 --> 01:00:18,401
stuff that's,
that's a hopeful story there that I 

1311
01:00:18,401 --> 01:00:18,401
haven't heard too much.

1312
01:00:18,401 --> 01:00:21,630
Oh yeah.
Well I'm more sanguine about this 

1313
01:00:21,630 --> 01:00:23,771
because I feel like just like we talked 
about people dismissing Jordan because 

1314
01:00:23,771 --> 01:00:26,870
they read a New York Times profile or 
like whatever the head pieces of the guy

1315
01:00:26,871 --> 01:00:28,610
who talked about him romancing the 
salvage,

1316
01:00:28,700 --> 01:00:30,650
like there's horrible stuff that's out 
there,

1317
01:00:31,250 --> 01:00:36,250
but they haven't actually read his book 
or they haven't seen an actual lecture 

1318
01:00:36,250 --> 01:00:38,270
or they haven't read an opposing piece.
Even if you only want to read profiles,

1319
01:00:38,271 --> 01:00:43,271
so it's like maybe read a flattering one
if you hold yourself to be an 

1320
01:00:43,271 --> 01:00:44,630
intellectual before dismissing him as a 
pseudo scientists,

1321
01:00:44,631 --> 01:00:46,970
which is absolutely absurd.
Given his academic record,

1322
01:00:47,330 --> 01:00:49,100
like maybe take a more,
a bigger position.

1323
01:00:49,340 --> 01:00:51,750
Same thing is happening in some ways 
with politics and like,

1324
01:00:52,040 --> 01:00:54,050
I don't ever want to put people on the 
spot,

1325
01:00:54,051 --> 01:00:55,400
but it's like,
you know,

1326
01:00:55,401 --> 01:01:00,401
I always feel like name a bunch of 
congressional candidates and people are 

1327
01:01:00,401 --> 01:01:03,851
like,
I'm Rossio and across you it's like 

1328
01:01:03,851 --> 01:01:04,760
people,
that's not what we're reading.

1329
01:01:04,760 --> 01:01:09,760
That's not the water we're swimming in.
And so to really have a conversation we 

1330
01:01:09,760 --> 01:01:11,630
have to go outside of the profiles 
about,

1331
01:01:11,650 --> 01:01:14,690
you know,
you being an old writer and Jordan being

1332
01:01:14,691 --> 01:01:16,700
whatever Jordan is this week.
It's amazing.

1333
01:01:16,701 --> 01:01:17,870
The things.
It's incredible.

1334
01:01:17,910 --> 01:01:22,910
Again,
know we need to go out and dig into 

1335
01:01:22,910 --> 01:01:25,061
that.
And that's the thing where I can say 

1336
01:01:25,061 --> 01:01:25,061
I've spent,
you know,

1337
01:01:25,061 --> 01:01:28,210
at this point,
hundreds of hours with the party and 

1338
01:01:28,210 --> 01:01:28,210
finding.
And I don't know all this stuff,

1339
01:01:28,210 --> 01:01:31,430
like I'm not a natural politician,
but I'm going to talk to people to go,

1340
01:01:31,610 --> 01:01:34,970
here's what I think we need to sort of 
unify the party,

1341
01:01:35,660 --> 01:01:37,820
you know,
under the values that I think that we've

1342
01:01:37,821 --> 01:01:40,880
had in the past and need to improve on 
in the future.

1343
01:01:40,881 --> 01:01:45,881
Especially with the anticorruption.
And here's the way that we need to talk 

1344
01:01:45,881 --> 01:01:49,301
about issues that they can see that the 
other side is human and that we don't 

1345
01:01:49,301 --> 01:01:52,370
have a magical ball to judge them and to
judge all of their moral shortcomings.

1346
01:01:53,450 --> 01:01:56,750
And what I'm finding again and again and
again and again,

1347
01:01:56,751 --> 01:02:01,130
is that these candidates are amazing,
but there's sort of no reason unless you

1348
01:02:01,131 --> 01:02:06,131
really go digging that you would have 
heard of them because no one's doing 

1349
01:02:06,131 --> 01:02:06,131
that.
And that's part of why I,

1350
01:02:06,131 --> 01:02:10,751
you know,
I called you to enlist you in my eval 

1351
01:02:10,751 --> 01:02:10,751
project and I was like,
look,

1352
01:02:10,751 --> 01:02:14,680
you and I agree on almost everything.
Let me get some people on here to talk 

1353
01:02:14,680 --> 01:02:19,121
to you so that you can see that that's,
that's in fact like 90 percent of the 

1354
01:02:19,121 --> 01:02:19,121
party.
Well,

1355
01:02:19,121 --> 01:02:23,261
that's the thing.
I care how this story ends as long as I 

1356
01:02:23,261 --> 01:02:23,261
remain true to myself.
So if,

1357
01:02:23,261 --> 01:02:23,760
if you succeed,
right?

1358
01:02:23,761 --> 01:02:28,761
And the messaging of this succeeds,
and five years from now I'm proud to be 

1359
01:02:28,761 --> 01:02:32,481
a Democrat again.
If that even matters in the labeling 

1360
01:02:32,481 --> 01:02:33,000
process or whether I'm,
wherever else I am,

1361
01:02:33,001 --> 01:02:34,920
as long as I'm true to myself,
that's what I care about,

1362
01:02:34,921 --> 01:02:39,921
but like it's like man,
get to it and make this thing work and 

1363
01:02:39,921 --> 01:02:39,921
that,
that would be great.

1364
01:02:39,921 --> 01:02:40,980
Well,
and I should also make,

1365
01:02:41,040 --> 01:02:46,040
make abundantly clear,
like I don't mean in any way to imply 

1366
01:02:46,040 --> 01:02:46,800
that I'm somehow like the magical 
steering.

1367
01:02:46,820 --> 01:02:47,100
No,
no,

1368
01:02:47,101 --> 01:02:47,790
I got you.
I mean,

1369
01:02:47,791 --> 01:02:48,990
you.
Yeah.

1370
01:02:49,200 --> 01:02:51,900
But I mean that's what I'm trying to do.
So I'm doing my part of that.

1371
01:02:51,901 --> 01:02:54,300
But obviously there's a lot of political
leadership.

1372
01:02:54,301 --> 01:02:56,520
There's a lot of people working on it.
My team is,

1373
01:02:56,770 --> 01:03:01,770
you know,
includes Marshall Herskovitz and Kenny 

1374
01:03:01,770 --> 01:03:03,940
Corey,
like we have a lot of people who are 

1375
01:03:03,940 --> 01:03:03,940
engaged in this.
So,

1376
01:03:03,940 --> 01:03:03,940
um,
but I mean,

1377
01:03:03,940 --> 01:03:05,310
your point holds,
I just realized I don't,

1378
01:03:05,311 --> 01:03:06,860
I don't want to sit here and pretend 
like I'm,

1379
01:03:06,930 --> 01:03:11,930
I'm the unique message or the party,
but I had been putting in a lot of time 

1380
01:03:11,930 --> 01:03:13,080
and I think I see things in a way.
Um,

1381
01:03:14,340 --> 01:03:19,340
I have a pretty broad range of friends 
and associates and I think I can really 

1382
01:03:19,561 --> 01:03:21,450
see things well from different 
perspectives.

1383
01:03:21,450 --> 01:03:22,770
Like if there,
if there is,

1384
01:03:23,030 --> 01:03:28,030
you know,
another talent that I would claim 

1385
01:03:28,030 --> 01:03:28,030
besides typing,
you know,

1386
01:03:28,030 --> 01:03:28,920
it might be that,
that like I'm,

1387
01:03:29,010 --> 01:03:33,480
I'm glad and empowered to have 
conversations with people like you where

1388
01:03:33,490 --> 01:03:38,490
you're,
where you have concerns that are 

1389
01:03:38,490 --> 01:03:38,700
different than mine and a real genuine 
curiosity to kind of go,

1390
01:03:38,701 --> 01:03:41,730
what are poke called poke holes in this.
Here's what I'm thinking.

1391
01:03:41,760 --> 01:03:46,760
Tell me everything that's dumped because
that'll give me a big benefit when I 

1392
01:03:46,760 --> 01:03:50,031
have to go sell it internally and 
certainly when we go out in the real 

1393
01:03:50,031 --> 01:03:52,641
world because then you're naked.
So if I can enlist people who think 

1394
01:03:52,641 --> 01:03:54,690
differently and see the world 
differently to really beat up ideas that

1395
01:03:54,691 --> 01:03:57,210
I might have it,
it's like that's just silly.

1396
01:03:57,240 --> 01:03:59,730
That's like wandering out into the mob 
naked,

1397
01:03:59,790 --> 01:04:01,040
you know?
So I'm,

1398
01:04:01,041 --> 01:04:06,041
I'm,
that's just something that's always 

1399
01:04:06,041 --> 01:04:06,041
intrigued me.

1400
01:04:06,041 --> 01:04:06,050
Yeah,
that's a pretty solid input.

1401
01:04:06,490 --> 01:04:11,490
Alright.
I think unless you got something better 

1402
01:04:11,490 --> 01:04:11,490
than that,
but that was that.

1403
01:04:11,490 --> 01:04:11,850
We kind of wrapped it nicely there.
Yeah.

1404
01:04:11,851 --> 01:04:16,851
Well,
before I deteriorate into 

1405
01:04:16,851 --> 01:04:16,851
inarticulateness,
maybe we'll just.

1406
01:04:16,851 --> 01:04:16,851
We'll call it a day.
All right.

1407
01:04:16,851 --> 01:04:18,700
We're going to do more on comic books 
next time I think we should do all comic

1408
01:04:18,701 --> 01:04:23,701
book.
We should just totally geek out and 

1409
01:04:23,701 --> 01:04:24,630
you'll have like three viewers like your
podcast low will get super.

1410
01:04:24,690 --> 01:04:29,690
Yeah.
Well maybe you'll get a whole bunch of 

1411
01:04:29,690 --> 01:04:29,690
other.
Yeah.

1412
01:04:29,690 --> 01:04:29,690
You just shift audiences.
That's true.

1413
01:04:29,690 --> 01:04:33,980
It's all the people who we associate 
with are not going to be interested 

1414
01:04:33,980 --> 01:04:33,980
back.
That's all right.

1415
01:04:33,980 --> 01:04:34,110
It's been a pleasure,
man.

1416
01:04:34,460 --> 01:04:36,690
For more on Greg,
follow him on twitter.

1417
01:04:36,691 --> 01:04:38,730
It's Greg,
two g's or width.
