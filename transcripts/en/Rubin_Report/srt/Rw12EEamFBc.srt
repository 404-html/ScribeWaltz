1
00:00:02,810 --> 00:00:05,330
Joining me via skype this week is Ayaan 
Hirsi Ali.

2
00:00:05,331 --> 00:00:07,100
I hope that most of you already know 
ion,

3
00:00:07,160 --> 00:00:07,993
but in case you don't,
her story is truly an incredible one 

4
00:00:10,521 --> 00:00:11,354
that takes her from a childhood in 
Somalia to an elected member of 

5
00:00:14,391 --> 00:00:17,750
parliament in Holland to a fearless free
speech advocate,

6
00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:21,560
a hated by both the extreme right and 
the regressive left.

7
00:00:21,860 --> 00:00:24,620
We'll dive deeper into her life's 
incredible journey shortly,

8
00:00:24,621 --> 00:00:25,454
but before we do that,
I wanted to take a moment to talk about 

9
00:00:27,621 --> 00:00:32,000
why people like Ian actually matter.
As our show has gained momentum here,

10
00:00:32,001 --> 00:00:36,140
I realized that what we're doing is 
really becoming an influential force for

11
00:00:36,141 --> 00:00:37,850
the things that I believed that 
mattered,

12
00:00:37,880 --> 00:00:40,340
namely the battle of ideas,
free speech,

13
00:00:40,341 --> 00:00:42,500
and liberal values.
At the end of the day,

14
00:00:42,501 --> 00:00:43,334
though,
I want this to be about more than talk 

15
00:00:44,991 --> 00:00:45,824
because the repercussions of these ideas
that we're talking about aren't just 

16
00:00:49,131 --> 00:00:50,360
abstract notions.

17
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:52,670
There stark realities for so many 
people.

18
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:56,000
I had Hirsi Ali as a survivor in every 
sense of the word.

19
00:00:56,060 --> 00:00:58,400
She survived.
Genital mutilation is a child.

20
00:00:58,401 --> 00:01:00,800
She survived a forced marriage to a 
cousin.

21
00:01:00,980 --> 00:01:01,813
She survived the cold blooded murder of 
a friend in broad daylight in Amsterdam 

22
00:01:05,630 --> 00:01:06,463
and subsequent death threats.
Many people would've given up after any 

23
00:01:09,291 --> 00:01:10,124
of these horrific events.
Many people would have just accepted 

24
00:01:12,171 --> 00:01:14,690
that this is what life has given them 
and remain quiet.

25
00:01:14,930 --> 00:01:18,320
Many people right this very second are 
doing just that.

26
00:01:18,770 --> 00:01:19,603
By the way,
I find no fault with these people who 

27
00:01:20,751 --> 00:01:25,190
remain silent under such subjugation.
They see no way out and sadly,

28
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:26,233
even though it's in the secular world 
who want to help them fear the 

29
00:01:28,791 --> 00:01:29,624
repercussions if they speak out,
not ion though she has bravely and 

30
00:01:32,361 --> 00:01:33,194
boldly fought for women's rights,
brought the issue of female genital 

31
00:01:35,571 --> 00:01:39,920
mutilation out in the open and 
relentlessly made her life story a cause

32
00:01:39,921 --> 00:01:40,970
bigger than herself.

33
00:01:41,420 --> 00:01:42,253
It's easy to sit back and privately talk
about these things or tweet about them 

34
00:01:44,781 --> 00:01:48,470
from the comfort of your own home,
but she's actually out there putting her

35
00:01:48,471 --> 00:01:51,560
life on the line after they already 
tried to take it from her.

36
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:54,350
I want to be very clear here that when I
talk about these issues,

37
00:01:54,351 --> 00:01:55,184
I'm talking about ideas and not people.
This seems to be a major sticking point 

38
00:01:59,241 --> 00:02:02,990
in this conversation and I really hope 
that we can eventually get past that,

39
00:02:02,991 --> 00:02:03,824
not just for the health of the debate,
but for all the young people currently 

40
00:02:06,801 --> 00:02:07,634
being indoctrinated with this ideology.
Imagine if a political party had a 

41
00:02:11,421 --> 00:02:13,940
platform that included female genital 
mutilation,

42
00:02:13,941 --> 00:02:18,941
forced marriage and death for apostates.
Absolutely insane and ridiculous.

43
00:02:19,071 --> 00:02:20,180
Right?
Well,

44
00:02:20,181 --> 00:02:21,740
guess what?
Religious ideas,

45
00:02:21,741 --> 00:02:22,574
cultural ideas,
any ideas deserve the exact same 

46
00:02:25,101 --> 00:02:28,130
scrutiny no matter how uncomfortable it 
makes us.

47
00:02:28,131 --> 00:02:28,964
I for one,
would rather live in a society that 

48
00:02:30,441 --> 00:02:32,720
deals with uncomfortable truths out in 
the open,

49
00:02:32,930 --> 00:02:36,290
then one that leaves huge portions of 
people alone in the dark.

50
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:39,953
I'm here with Ion Hirsi Ali,
human rights activist and author of the 

51
00:02:42,901 --> 00:02:45,930
new book heretic.
Why Islam needs a reformation?

52
00:02:45,931 --> 00:02:49,010
Now I am welcome to the show.
Thank you.

53
00:02:49,170 --> 00:02:50,700
Thank you dave.
Thank you for having me on.

54
00:02:50,850 --> 00:02:53,340
So I'm going to show all my cards right 
upfront here.

55
00:02:53,341 --> 00:02:57,960
I'm such a huge admirer of yours and I 
think you've done such good work and,

56
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,090
and your story's amazing and your,
your bravery is amazing.

57
00:03:01,091 --> 00:03:04,300
So I'm going to hold nothing back and 
just set us off on that,

58
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:07,180
on that good welcoming note.
Is that okay with you?

59
00:03:07,930 --> 00:03:10,600
Thank you.
Thank you for having me on again,

60
00:03:10,630 --> 00:03:13,180
and we'll thank you for everything you 
said.

61
00:03:13,210 --> 00:03:14,090
So,
uh,

62
00:03:14,170 --> 00:03:15,003
there's a ton that I want to talk to you
about and so many of the things that 

63
00:03:17,501 --> 00:03:18,334
your life is an example of are the 
things that we've been talking about on 

64
00:03:20,861 --> 00:03:21,694
the show here for months now.
And I know many of my guests have been 

65
00:03:24,491 --> 00:03:25,324
people that you're friends with and,
and coworkers with and I've done 

66
00:03:27,671 --> 00:03:29,380
speeches with,
um,

67
00:03:29,470 --> 00:03:32,500
but your story is the most unique and 
most interesting.

68
00:03:32,501 --> 00:03:33,334
And I want to talk about the book,
but I thought we could just spend about 

69
00:03:34,961 --> 00:03:38,100
10 minutes just sort of on your 
biography and I know you've,

70
00:03:38,150 --> 00:03:41,350
you've discussed it a lot and that's one
of the books is about,

71
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:42,393
but if you could,
it's so illuminating to sort of how you 

72
00:03:44,531 --> 00:03:45,364
got here.
So if you could just tell me a little 

73
00:03:46,721 --> 00:03:50,680
bit first about growing up in Somalia 
and uh,

74
00:03:50,900 --> 00:03:51,880
let's just start with that.

75
00:03:53,980 --> 00:03:54,813
Well,
I was born into a Somali Muslim 

76
00:03:57,671 --> 00:04:02,671
household and if I look at my journey 
from,

77
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:05,560
I was born in 19,
69 November,

78
00:04:05,590 --> 00:04:09,400
my family went to Saudi Arabia,
we lived in Ethiopia,

79
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:10,593
we lived in Kenya,
and then I went to the Netherlands and 

80
00:04:13,301 --> 00:04:15,250
now I live in the United States of 
America.

81
00:04:15,550 --> 00:04:18,400
I think if you look at my geographical 
journey,

82
00:04:18,430 --> 00:04:20,650
there's really nothing unique about it 
today.

83
00:04:21,490 --> 00:04:24,430
People from all over the world moved to 
different places,

84
00:04:24,431 --> 00:04:27,820
learn different languages and adapt to 
different situations.

85
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:32,890
I think that what Western is a find 
interesting,

86
00:04:32,950 --> 00:04:33,783
intriguing,
and maybe in some ways disconcerting is 

87
00:04:38,470 --> 00:04:40,350
the intellectual journey.
Uh,

88
00:04:40,870 --> 00:04:45,550
I was raised as a Muslim.
I was raised in a clan or tribal society

89
00:04:45,940 --> 00:04:46,773
and the model framework that prevails 
there is that of honor and shame and 

90
00:04:52,511 --> 00:04:56,350
it's a different kind of honor and shame
from what we believe here in the West,

91
00:04:56,351 --> 00:04:57,220
which is,
you know,

92
00:04:57,460 --> 00:04:58,293
as a little girl at the age of five,
my genitals were cut and when I was old 

93
00:05:03,401 --> 00:05:05,560
enough to ask why did that happen?

94
00:05:05,890 --> 00:05:07,570
My grandmother was very,
you know,

95
00:05:07,571 --> 00:05:08,404
she really explained it as well.
We purified you and if you are not 

96
00:05:13,420 --> 00:05:16,270
purified,
you will never find a husband.

97
00:05:16,540 --> 00:05:17,373
So that kind of practice is,
and it isn't something that happened 

98
00:05:19,961 --> 00:05:20,794
only to me.
It happened to happens according to the 

99
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:29,410
United Nations number is two 98 percent 
of Somalis,

100
00:05:29,410 --> 00:05:30,243
Egyptians,
Sudanese.

101
00:05:30,750 --> 00:05:31,583
Uh,
so that's one thing that people find 

102
00:05:33,071 --> 00:05:33,904
fascinating.
How could you have India with something 

103
00:05:35,291 --> 00:05:38,380
like that and come out a cultural 
context like that.

104
00:05:38,770 --> 00:05:41,230
And then fast forward,
when I'm 22 years old,

105
00:05:41,231 --> 00:05:44,530
my father returns from a long journey.
He was,

106
00:05:44,531 --> 00:05:46,870
he had left at this for 10 years in 
Kenya,

107
00:05:47,020 --> 00:05:49,810
a country that if you're a Somali,
you feel you know,

108
00:05:49,811 --> 00:05:50,644
you are in a foreign country,
comes back and he feels he has the show 

109
00:05:54,820 --> 00:05:58,360
as my father to marry me off until the 
first student,

110
00:05:58,390 --> 00:06:00,470
the first guy who comes along and says,
you know,

111
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:03,440
I'm off the same clan as you.
I'm looking for a wife,

112
00:06:03,620 --> 00:06:06,470
which go would you like to offer?
And then I'm the one who offered.

113
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:08,960
So to Western as that seems pretty 
straight,

114
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:10,593
this person,
just to be clear that this person was a 

115
00:06:11,411 --> 00:06:12,700
distant cousin of yours,
right?

116
00:06:12,910 --> 00:06:15,730
Which probably wasn't that abnormal for,
for that area.

117
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:17,710
Absolutely not.
In fact,

118
00:06:17,711 --> 00:06:18,544
the closer the kinship,
the better because the only way to make 

119
00:06:22,241 --> 00:06:26,110
sure that family members are loyal to 
one another.

120
00:06:26,140 --> 00:06:28,330
Share wealth,
don't mistreat one another,

121
00:06:28,660 --> 00:06:32,590
is to try and marry within the same 
family as much as possible.

122
00:06:32,890 --> 00:06:35,500
Obviously with all the genetical 
problems,

123
00:06:35,501 --> 00:06:38,090
but that's not what we were looking at.
But that's it.

124
00:06:38,230 --> 00:06:39,610
That's the context.
You know,

125
00:06:39,611 --> 00:06:41,380
your,
your roles as a male,

126
00:06:41,410 --> 00:06:42,243
as a female that's given as a female you
can bring shame not only on your father 

127
00:06:47,771 --> 00:06:49,240
and mother,
your brother and sister,

128
00:06:49,510 --> 00:06:53,530
but the extended family as well.
And even extended religion.

129
00:06:53,980 --> 00:06:54,813
And so I think what is fascinating for 
most Western as is how could you that 

130
00:06:58,751 --> 00:07:00,010
intellectual journey.
How come?

131
00:07:00,011 --> 00:07:05,011
Once I believed in all of that,
I lived it and now I,

132
00:07:05,171 --> 00:07:06,550
I'm saying,
you know,

133
00:07:06,551 --> 00:07:09,550
as an individual you have a right to be 
free,

134
00:07:09,551 --> 00:07:10,384
to choose who you want to marry.
You don't have to cut off the genitals 

135
00:07:13,810 --> 00:07:14,643
of girls for them to be married.
You don't even have to be mad if you 

136
00:07:17,441 --> 00:07:22,441
don't want to,
because as an economic security,

137
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:27,460
as a woman in the western context where 
there is the rule of law,

138
00:07:27,490 --> 00:07:30,610
what is freedom and where there's this 
wonderful education systems.

139
00:07:30,870 --> 00:07:35,870
I was a go.
You can actually choose what you want to

140
00:07:36,551 --> 00:07:39,340
do in life.
You can map out your own destiny.

141
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:40,230
Yeah,
and that's,

142
00:07:40,230 --> 00:07:41,063
that's why I love your story so much and
why I find you so inspirational because 

143
00:07:43,441 --> 00:07:45,510
you're,
you're truly living,

144
00:07:45,511 --> 00:07:50,460
breathing proof that things can change 
and that people and girls,

145
00:07:50,461 --> 00:07:53,700
especially from this part of the world 
can have a different life.

146
00:07:53,730 --> 00:07:54,563
And that's why I find it so wonderful.
But let's just back up for just a 

147
00:07:57,121 --> 00:07:59,490
second.
On the female genital mutilation.

148
00:07:59,491 --> 00:08:00,990
When,
when this happened to you,

149
00:08:01,300 --> 00:08:03,840
um,
did you immediately,

150
00:08:04,050 --> 00:08:05,610
and you spoke to your grandmother and 
all this,

151
00:08:05,820 --> 00:08:06,653
but did you immediately questioned 
everything I to be that age and go 

152
00:08:09,571 --> 00:08:11,700
through something like that?
How long,

153
00:08:11,730 --> 00:08:12,563
how long did it take before you really 
were questioning everything about your 

154
00:08:17,581 --> 00:08:18,414
life?

155
00:08:18,980 --> 00:08:21,950
At the age of five,
I didn't question it at the age of 10,

156
00:08:21,951 --> 00:08:24,170
I didn't question anything at the age of
20,

157
00:08:24,171 --> 00:08:27,110
but I didn't question anything.
But there's always,

158
00:08:27,111 --> 00:08:30,110
as you grow up,
and I remember for me,

159
00:08:30,610 --> 00:08:31,920
um,
in,

160
00:08:31,950 --> 00:08:32,783
in,
in terms of evolving as you're evolving 

161
00:08:36,171 --> 00:08:40,790
from childhood to maturity,
it was the ages of 14,

162
00:08:40,791 --> 00:08:43,720
15,
16 when I want to know,

163
00:08:43,750 --> 00:08:44,583
you know,
what's the point of this life and why 

164
00:08:45,771 --> 00:08:49,040
are we put on rf and is it only to 
reproduce?

165
00:08:49,190 --> 00:08:51,100
We're at that point in my family,
I,

166
00:08:51,110 --> 00:08:54,170
we're going through a lot of adversity 
and it is what is the point,

167
00:08:54,750 --> 00:08:57,660
what is the point?
So instead of being suicidal,

168
00:08:57,900 --> 00:09:02,430
I joined the Muslim Brotherhood because 
they make the point so very clear.

169
00:09:02,940 --> 00:09:03,773
You've been put on this earth to be by 
God to be tested for your absolute 

170
00:09:07,321 --> 00:09:09,900
submission.
You're going to be tested as a female in

171
00:09:09,901 --> 00:09:12,630
various ways and as a male in various 
ways.

172
00:09:13,380 --> 00:09:14,213
And you just have to say yes to that 
submits and on your points and for your 

173
00:09:19,261 --> 00:09:20,094
audience.
I'm just going to give you one 

174
00:09:21,361 --> 00:09:23,150
interesting,
um,

175
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:25,980
way in which,
how do they,

176
00:09:26,070 --> 00:09:26,903
how,
how does one even manipulate that as a 

177
00:09:28,891 --> 00:09:29,724
believing Muslim?
How does one know that you know you're 

178
00:09:31,561 --> 00:09:32,394
doing what God wants you to do?
You have two angels on either side of 

179
00:09:36,901 --> 00:09:39,330
your shoulders.
When you're hide side,

180
00:09:39,570 --> 00:09:44,570
you have an angel that notes down minute
by minute,

181
00:09:45,811 --> 00:09:46,644
second by second you have good 
intentions versus you have bad 

182
00:09:49,921 --> 00:09:51,300
intentions.
So we're not here.

183
00:09:51,301 --> 00:09:55,350
We're not even talking about what you 
say before you say it,

184
00:09:55,770 --> 00:09:56,603
but on top of that,
that same angel also notes Don what you 

185
00:10:00,151 --> 00:10:03,060
say,
and then your behavior and on your left,

186
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:05,850
same thing.
Everything that you do that is strong,

187
00:10:06,690 --> 00:10:11,690
that angel is doing the book keeping and
you will live,

188
00:10:12,420 --> 00:10:13,950
and at some point you die.

189
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:17,850
And then there is the here after this,
the Day of Judgment.

190
00:10:18,100 --> 00:10:21,510
And we're told as Muslims,
no one can escape that you're,

191
00:10:21,690 --> 00:10:23,170
oh God.
And His tribe,

192
00:10:23,171 --> 00:10:25,570
you know,
you'll be for God and his tribe.

193
00:10:25,580 --> 00:10:26,413
You know the prophets,
the angels of all his other human 

194
00:10:28,441 --> 00:10:29,274
beings.
And those two books are going to be put 

195
00:10:30,931 --> 00:10:35,931
on a scale and if you afraid handbook 
weighs heavier than your left hand book,

196
00:10:37,410 --> 00:10:42,180
you go to heaven and if you are left,
handbook goes weighs heavier,

197
00:10:42,181 --> 00:10:47,070
you go to hell.
And you know as you grow up,

198
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:52,320
it's especially with the radical 
Islamisation of or things.

199
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:58,560
These things are made so explicit to you
and you become so aware of them.

200
00:10:58,561 --> 00:11:01,500
It's like in the west,
it's like taking,

201
00:11:01,530 --> 00:11:03,030
keeping track of your calories.

202
00:11:04,890 --> 00:11:05,723
Well,
it's interesting because even the way 

203
00:11:06,511 --> 00:11:07,344
you're describing it,
there's sort of a whimsical miss to the 

204
00:11:09,091 --> 00:11:12,150
way you're describing it because now as 
a secular person,

205
00:11:12,151 --> 00:11:12,984
it sounds so ridiculous to you.
And yet there's literally millions of 

206
00:11:17,131 --> 00:11:20,280
people that believe in this in a,
in a literal sense.

207
00:11:20,790 --> 00:11:22,200
Absolutely,
absolutely.

208
00:11:22,201 --> 00:11:23,280
And you know,
you're young,

209
00:11:23,281 --> 00:11:25,230
you trust your parents,
your teachers,

210
00:11:25,231 --> 00:11:29,520
your and Islam is your religion and 
religion.

211
00:11:30,090 --> 00:11:30,923
I mean,
I know that all human beings who are 

212
00:11:32,190 --> 00:11:35,010
religious are taught that the criteria,
you know,

213
00:11:35,011 --> 00:11:36,950
the framework,
what,

214
00:11:37,140 --> 00:11:39,750
how do we know the difference between 
what's right and what's wrong?

215
00:11:39,870 --> 00:11:43,410
Religion tells us that.
And so as a Muslim and Islam is a way of

216
00:11:43,411 --> 00:11:45,990
life,
you are told that this is the difference

217
00:11:45,991 --> 00:11:46,824
between right and wrong and these things
are spelled out that which is forbidden 

218
00:11:52,550 --> 00:11:55,150
her on that which is permitted.
Hello.

219
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:57,910
And so then it's up to you.
There's a level of,

220
00:11:59,140 --> 00:12:01,660
there's a level of choice in there,
you know,

221
00:12:01,980 --> 00:12:02,813
it sounds like,
it sounds like the guy on your shoulder 

222
00:12:04,441 --> 00:12:06,570
already knows your intentions anyway.
Right?

223
00:12:07,070 --> 00:12:09,560
Exactly.
So even if you abstain,

224
00:12:10,820 --> 00:12:14,360
they still.
Angel's still knows you want to indulge.

225
00:12:14,750 --> 00:12:15,380
Wow.
Alright.

226
00:12:15,380 --> 00:12:17,420
So I want to talk a lot about.
I want to talk.

227
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:19,250
It's funny that it seems funny to you 
now.

228
00:12:19,251 --> 00:12:20,630
I'm,
I'm glad to see that.

229
00:12:20,631 --> 00:12:23,120
And you have a beautiful smile so it's 
nice because you've,

230
00:12:23,121 --> 00:12:25,040
you've come out of this.
So it really is nice.

231
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:28,070
So I just want to do one more thing on 
your bio and then we can,

232
00:12:28,100 --> 00:12:32,360
we can get into some of the specifics 
about the doctrine and things sort of in

233
00:12:32,361 --> 00:12:34,500
your life after that.
Um,

234
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:35,473
so you,
you made political asylum in the 

235
00:12:36,741 --> 00:12:39,260
Netherlands,
you then became member of parliament.

236
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:42,920
This is an incredible story of success 
and you know,

237
00:12:42,921 --> 00:12:45,320
with all the refugee things going on in 
Europe right now,

238
00:12:45,321 --> 00:12:46,154
there's a lot of parallels to that.
You found safety and became successful 

239
00:12:49,131 --> 00:12:49,964
and influential and went on to talk 
about female genital mutilation and 

240
00:12:52,851 --> 00:12:55,190
women's rights and all this incredible 
stuff.

241
00:12:55,850 --> 00:12:56,683
But here,
of course I have to mention that then 

242
00:12:58,581 --> 00:12:59,414
Theo van Gogh was doing a movie based on
a script that you wrote and he was 

243
00:13:03,711 --> 00:13:08,711
killed by a Muslim extremist in broad 
daylight in Amsterdam at 9:00

244
00:13:09,110 --> 00:13:11,930
AM in the morning.
And as if that wasn't horrific enough,

245
00:13:12,260 --> 00:13:13,093
the person that killed him pinned a 
death threat to you on this person's 

246
00:13:18,171 --> 00:13:19,360
body.
Now I know,

247
00:13:19,361 --> 00:13:20,194
I know you've talked about this a lot 
and I know people hear things like this 

248
00:13:23,181 --> 00:13:26,230
and I don't think he quite gets to them.
You know,

249
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:28,190
it sounds like a movie sort of.
Right?

250
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:33,200
And so I just want you to talk about a 
little bit about it specifically,

251
00:13:33,201 --> 00:13:36,860
but also just the feeling that it left 
you with the sort of terror.

252
00:13:37,190 --> 00:13:38,930
Because it's one thing to say these 
things happen,

253
00:13:38,931 --> 00:13:39,764
but you're,
you're a person that these things 

254
00:13:41,300 --> 00:13:42,500
actually happen to.

255
00:13:44,030 --> 00:13:44,863
Well,
in a way I have to say the difference 

256
00:13:46,881 --> 00:13:51,881
between a Theo fungo and myself was that
I believed in those threats.

257
00:13:52,401 --> 00:13:53,234
I didn't know exactly what the 
individuals who were threatening me 

258
00:13:56,630 --> 00:14:01,630
would do.
So two years prior to a theo's death,

259
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:03,133
I started to take all kinds of security 
precautions and when he and I were 

260
00:14:06,711 --> 00:14:08,630
working together,
I kept saying to you,

261
00:14:08,690 --> 00:14:09,523
you know,
I know it sounds surreal in a Dutch 

262
00:14:12,111 --> 00:14:12,944
context.
I think he would tell me over and over 

263
00:14:15,381 --> 00:14:16,214
again,
do you know the last thing in the 

264
00:14:18,351 --> 00:14:19,184
Netherlands,
someone was killed because of what they 

265
00:14:21,381 --> 00:14:25,250
believed in,
and he would give me years from the 17th

266
00:14:25,251 --> 00:14:27,380
century like we,
we had Dutch,

267
00:14:27,410 --> 00:14:30,170
this is the Netherlands,
we don't do that sort of thing,

268
00:14:30,680 --> 00:14:31,520
so relaxed,

269
00:14:31,550 --> 00:14:34,220
let's do this.
And that was actually true because.

270
00:14:34,310 --> 00:14:35,143
Because Holland was an incredible place 
of mixed cultures and religions and 

271
00:14:38,391 --> 00:14:39,680
ethnicities and all that.
Right?

272
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:41,073
Absolutely.

273
00:14:42,020 --> 00:14:42,853
And it wasn't only that,
it was also in the wider Europe when in 

274
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:51,140
hundreds of years ago to a 17th century,
18th century,

275
00:14:51,620 --> 00:14:55,770
when on religious grounds people would 
face in tolerance,

276
00:14:55,850 --> 00:14:58,520
so much as to threaten their lives,
thinkers,

277
00:14:58,880 --> 00:14:59,713
creative people.
They would go to the Netherlands and 

278
00:15:01,671 --> 00:15:06,671
they would get a sanctuary.
And so for him it was for Theo,

279
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:10,730
it making this film,
it wasn't about that,

280
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:16,070
it was about preserving what he knew was
his culture,

281
00:15:16,071 --> 00:15:20,030
his civilization,
and really not just Dutch civilization.

282
00:15:20,031 --> 00:15:25,031
I think civilization with a capital c 
when human beings can discuss and,

283
00:15:25,570 --> 00:15:26,403
uh,
can disagree without having to threaten 

284
00:15:28,671 --> 00:15:29,510
with force,
right?

285
00:15:29,540 --> 00:15:34,540
So in a bizarre way by,
by them killing him instead of you in a,

286
00:15:35,090 --> 00:15:35,923
in a weird,
I know this sounds perverse or 

287
00:15:36,591 --> 00:15:37,424
something,
but that was more of a direct attack on 

288
00:15:40,130 --> 00:15:41,090
Holland,
right?

289
00:15:41,091 --> 00:15:43,040
Because they were going after one of 
their own,

290
00:15:43,041 --> 00:15:43,874
so to speak,

291
00:15:44,110 --> 00:15:45,880
so to speak.
And I had,

292
00:15:45,970 --> 00:15:50,260
I had accepted the perimeters that the 
government puts me within,

293
00:15:50,300 --> 00:15:52,030
you know,
a security framework,

294
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:53,193
which was a really is something that I 
would never ever accept anything like 

295
00:15:58,151 --> 00:16:00,910
that because these security measures a 
cattail,

296
00:16:00,911 --> 00:16:03,790
you have freedom to a degree that you 
are not free.

297
00:16:03,791 --> 00:16:08,791
And Him I'm never going to accept that.
And he wanted to prove to them it is not

298
00:16:09,220 --> 00:16:13,960
having to put a shell around the people 
who are practicing free speech.

299
00:16:14,110 --> 00:16:14,943
That is not the answer.
The answer is to openly discuss these 

300
00:16:18,071 --> 00:16:18,904
things and make them open.
If these people are provoked by what is 

301
00:16:21,161 --> 00:16:25,630
that was that particular film was this 
is what the Koran says about women.

302
00:16:25,870 --> 00:16:29,110
This is how it's put into practice.
That's what we need to be talking about.

303
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:31,000
Why we shouldn't be talking about 
security.

304
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:32,320
And he gets killed.

305
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:33,153
And I think by doing the murderer killed
Theo fungo and that incident confronted 

306
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:40,233
Dutch society and Dutch leadership.
And I think the wider European Western 

307
00:16:43,001 --> 00:16:44,940
leadership with,
you know,

308
00:16:44,950 --> 00:16:48,250
we can all go around saying,
talking about the First Amendment,

309
00:16:48,251 --> 00:16:50,230
freedom of speech,
freedom of expression,

310
00:16:50,410 --> 00:16:51,131
all of this.
That.

311
00:16:51,131 --> 00:16:51,964
And the other,
but what are we willing to do to 

312
00:16:54,551 --> 00:16:55,820
preserve it?
And he,

313
00:16:56,030 --> 00:16:56,863
he has left us with that question and 
I'm disappointed to say that so far we 

314
00:17:00,731 --> 00:17:02,800
haven't done that much because as you 
know,

315
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:05,200
this year,
the beginning of this year,

316
00:17:06,100 --> 00:17:11,100
the cartoonists in Paris or killed and 
the threats to free speech continues and

317
00:17:13,571 --> 00:17:16,420
if government policies are anything to 
go by,

318
00:17:16,450 --> 00:17:20,620
it seems as if they are telling us it's 
best not to provoke them.

319
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:21,481
Yeah.
All right.

320
00:17:21,481 --> 00:17:23,810
So I really want to focus on that 
because that's been one of,

321
00:17:23,850 --> 00:17:25,200
you know,
this free speech,

322
00:17:25,460 --> 00:17:27,420
uh,
and political correctness.

323
00:17:27,421 --> 00:17:28,254
It's become this perfect storm that's 
actually strengthening everything that 

324
00:17:30,901 --> 00:17:31,734
it should be against a.
But just to put a final cap on your bio 

325
00:17:35,101 --> 00:17:36,900
and all that.
What was it like for you?

326
00:17:36,901 --> 00:17:38,790
I mean really at the,
at the personal level,

327
00:17:39,140 --> 00:17:40,290
when,
when he was killed,

328
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:42,810
did you want to just disappeared?
Did you want to leave the country?

329
00:17:42,811 --> 00:17:46,710
Did you want to give up?
Because now you've lived for these last.

330
00:17:46,850 --> 00:17:48,530
How many years ago was this?
This was

331
00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:49,920
this for,

332
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:50,993
right?
So you've lived for these last 11 years 

333
00:17:52,021 --> 00:17:55,080
honoring everything he stood for,
but I'm sure there must have been a time

334
00:17:55,081 --> 00:17:57,360
when you thought,
let me just get out of this.

335
00:17:57,361 --> 00:17:58,194
Right?

336
00:17:58,260 --> 00:17:59,370
Well,
I think it every day.

337
00:17:59,430 --> 00:18:02,490
I think it all the time.
It's so tempting to just think,

338
00:18:02,790 --> 00:18:04,110
you know,
I've done enough.

339
00:18:04,140 --> 00:18:05,670
I'm,
I'm.

340
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:08,400
This is my age.
I'm 46 years old next month.

341
00:18:08,810 --> 00:18:12,720
Uh,
there's nothing for me in it personally,

342
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:18,330
but it's,
I think it's what high accident made the

343
00:18:18,331 --> 00:18:19,164
difference between being comfortable,
which if I just disappeared and changed 

344
00:18:23,341 --> 00:18:24,174
my name,
I would be very comfortable versus 

345
00:18:26,820 --> 00:18:30,660
actually living,
which is when you're challenged and when

346
00:18:30,690 --> 00:18:33,690
civilization is challenged,
when our freedoms are challenged,

347
00:18:34,020 --> 00:18:34,853
we always rely on those who stand up for
it and those who wanted to push their 

348
00:18:40,291 --> 00:18:44,160
agenda through intimidation,
through force.

349
00:18:44,370 --> 00:18:46,740
They know that their argument is very 
weak.

350
00:18:47,220 --> 00:18:50,100
Otherwise,
why would they avoid discussion?

351
00:18:50,101 --> 00:18:55,101
Why is it difficult for them to showcase
what the Quran and Allah and Heidi's the

352
00:18:58,531 --> 00:18:59,364
sayings of the Prophet Mohammed and the 
Jewish food ins and the practice of 

353
00:19:02,971 --> 00:19:06,120
Islam says about women in essays to 
women.

354
00:19:06,300 --> 00:19:07,133
Why are they afraid of women?
All women had a 100 percent the freedom 

355
00:19:11,821 --> 00:19:16,710
to choose.
And if your message is superior,

356
00:19:16,890 --> 00:19:17,723
why not?
Why not allow people to just choose for 

357
00:19:19,541 --> 00:19:19,670
it?

358
00:19:19,670 --> 00:19:23,660
One of the things we've really focused 
on here is what I'm now calling and what

359
00:19:23,661 --> 00:19:27,290
Majid new eyes has coined as the 
regressive left.

360
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:28,433
That there,
there are people I come from the 

361
00:19:29,901 --> 00:19:30,734
progressive world,
that that's where I've been for these 

362
00:19:32,511 --> 00:19:33,344
last couple of years and it's only 
really in the last six months that I've 

363
00:19:35,871 --> 00:19:38,930
had my own awakening that I realized it 
was my guys.

364
00:19:38,931 --> 00:19:43,730
It's my guys on the left that are trying
to silence people like you in silence.

365
00:19:43,731 --> 00:19:47,150
People like Sam Harris and,
and modular and all of this.

366
00:19:47,390 --> 00:19:48,990
And uh,
and I've had salmon.

367
00:19:49,020 --> 00:19:51,380
I've had my jacket on and I include you 
in that.

368
00:19:51,710 --> 00:19:52,543
Um,
and I think partially I think that Sam 

369
00:19:55,191 --> 00:19:59,750
said that party or my agent said the 
part of his awakening was after a debate

370
00:19:59,751 --> 00:20:01,610
that he had with you.
Um,

371
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:04,280
what do you make of this coming from the
left?

372
00:20:04,281 --> 00:20:06,890
Because the left is supposed to debate 
ideas,

373
00:20:06,891 --> 00:20:07,724
right?
We're supposed to be about ideas free 

374
00:20:09,291 --> 00:20:14,180
thought and yet it's those very people 
who are trying to silence you.

375
00:20:14,380 --> 00:20:15,740
I,
I'm amazed by this.

376
00:20:16,790 --> 00:20:19,190
I think what I've seen and I could be 
wrong,

377
00:20:19,370 --> 00:20:23,810
is that what the left does is they put 
all the emphasis on justice,

378
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:24,673
the concept of justice and maybe what 
the rights rather classical liberals 

379
00:20:29,331 --> 00:20:32,020
because those are the people I identify 
with and in the US,

380
00:20:32,030 --> 00:20:35,660
they are called conservatives,
sometimes libertarians.

381
00:20:35,661 --> 00:20:36,494
But um,
what classical liberals do is they put 

382
00:20:38,871 --> 00:20:39,704
the emphasis on freedom.
And I was exposed to these concepts 

383
00:20:45,380 --> 00:20:46,213
between say 1995 when I go to the 
University of flight and until 2000 and 

384
00:20:50,731 --> 00:20:55,731
then 2001 something happens that makes 
me intent on testing these ideas.

385
00:20:56,860 --> 00:21:00,640
And what I have discovered like many 
people before me,

386
00:21:00,641 --> 00:21:01,474
and I think you will as as you grow,
is that there is no justice without 

387
00:21:08,711 --> 00:21:12,790
freedom.
And so if you accept and that is freedom

388
00:21:12,850 --> 00:21:13,683
from coercion,
freedom from being forced into doing 

389
00:21:15,941 --> 00:21:16,774
something you don't want to do or using 
the tools of state to make individuals 

390
00:21:21,461 --> 00:21:25,310
to do something they don't want to do.
Or with government failing art,

391
00:21:25,790 --> 00:21:26,623
you know,
having one individual take the freedom 

392
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:30,940
of the other individuals.
But if you have no freedom then you will

393
00:21:30,941 --> 00:21:31,774
have no adjustments.

394
00:21:32,020 --> 00:21:32,780
Yeah.
So,

395
00:21:32,780 --> 00:21:35,020
so I'm with you on just to see 
secondary.

396
00:21:35,410 --> 00:21:36,243
Right?
So what do you make of the tactics that 

397
00:21:38,651 --> 00:21:41,530
they use because there's been so much.
We've talked about it so much,

398
00:21:41,531 --> 00:21:44,800
but so much lying and smearing about 
people's views including your own.

399
00:21:45,010 --> 00:21:45,843
Even when I,
when I've just tweeted that I'm having 

400
00:21:46,991 --> 00:21:47,824
you on the show.
Fortunately because we've built 

401
00:21:49,241 --> 00:21:50,380
something good here.
I think,

402
00:21:50,620 --> 00:21:52,570
you know,
80 percent of it was positive,

403
00:21:52,571 --> 00:21:53,404
but a lot of people she's racist.
I mean they're telling me that you are 

404
00:21:56,231 --> 00:21:57,730
racist.
So what,

405
00:21:57,731 --> 00:22:00,040
what do you make of the tactics that 
they're using?

406
00:22:00,190 --> 00:22:03,190
Because I do think they think they're 
doing something lofty.

407
00:22:03,191 --> 00:22:04,024
They think they're there helping the 
downtrodden or something like that when 

408
00:22:07,571 --> 00:22:08,404
in actuality they're strengthening the 
very people that they should by 

409
00:22:11,501 --> 00:22:12,790
definition be against

410
00:22:13,820 --> 00:22:16,850
and I think that is because if you put 
the emphasis on justice,

411
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:20,780
you are by definition going to start 
talking about groups and collectives.

412
00:22:20,810 --> 00:22:25,810
Groups in abstract.
You belong to a group for a short period

413
00:22:26,121 --> 00:22:28,250
of time.
You're a member of whatever you are,

414
00:22:28,260 --> 00:22:29,093
collective you are a member of for a 
certain amount of time but freely all 

415
00:22:31,851 --> 00:22:33,410
the time.
You are an individual.

416
00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:34,513
So the basic arguments I used to have 
with the left and I started out in the 

417
00:22:38,751 --> 00:22:39,584
Netherlands was okay,
so you want to protect the culture and 

418
00:22:43,371 --> 00:22:46,550
the religion of this collective and this
collective is saying,

419
00:22:46,551 --> 00:22:49,880
if we don't practice our religion the 
way we used to back at home,

420
00:22:50,300 --> 00:22:51,133
we are just not happy.
We feel deprived when we feel 

421
00:22:53,301 --> 00:22:54,134
persecuted,
we don't feel at home and that has all 

422
00:22:56,571 --> 00:22:59,600
kinds of psychological effect on the 
entire group.

423
00:23:00,110 --> 00:23:01,520
But what about the individual?

424
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:04,190
What about the individual goal?
Who's removed from school?

425
00:23:04,430 --> 00:23:08,420
What about individual girl who's forced 
into a marriage where she's consistently

426
00:23:08,440 --> 00:23:09,273
rate,
she can't reach out to her parents 

427
00:23:10,581 --> 00:23:13,970
because they put her in that situation.
Her husband thinks he has a right.

428
00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:15,920
What about that individual?
Right.

429
00:23:16,190 --> 00:23:19,460
What about the individual right to say,
I don't want to do this.

430
00:23:19,461 --> 00:23:20,294
I want to do something else and you're 
forcing this individual into doing that 

431
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:28,900
and these constitutions in liberal 
countries is all about heck.

432
00:23:28,950 --> 00:23:29,783
Organizing that individual freedom and 
aspiring to protect it as much as 

433
00:23:34,251 --> 00:23:35,084
possible,
and so what I tell my left wing friends 

434
00:23:37,430 --> 00:23:40,640
and I have a lot of them because a lot 
of them have good intentions and they're

435
00:23:40,641 --> 00:23:43,220
progressive and they want to stand up 
for the poor.

436
00:23:43,221 --> 00:23:43,960
The downtown.

437
00:23:43,960 --> 00:23:45,530
It doesn't feel the same way.
Yeah,

438
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:46,793
it is.
Just to take them back to that unit so 

439
00:23:49,140 --> 00:23:54,140
that they can empathize with.
If you're gay and you're on the left and

440
00:23:54,380 --> 00:23:56,450
on the one hand you belong to a 
movement.

441
00:23:56,451 --> 00:23:59,570
You're fighting for the right in America
to marry,

442
00:24:00,110 --> 00:24:00,943
but on the other hand,
you're also fighting for the rights of 

443
00:24:02,781 --> 00:24:06,620
some minority collective to do what ever
they want.

444
00:24:06,680 --> 00:24:07,513
To the individual members,
shouldn't you be thinking about the 

445
00:24:09,741 --> 00:24:10,574
plight of the individual members,
those who can't voice their wishes and 

446
00:24:13,821 --> 00:24:17,030
those who if they do have to deal with 
consequences,

447
00:24:17,031 --> 00:24:17,864
so die,
and I'm not talking about death and 

448
00:24:19,161 --> 00:24:19,994
threats,
I'm talking about your father looking 

449
00:24:21,591 --> 00:24:23,630
you in the eye and tell him you're no 
longer my daughter.

450
00:24:23,631 --> 00:24:24,464
I disown you.
You control yourself up in the mosque 

451
00:24:26,870 --> 00:24:29,180
you are not invited to,
so you are shunned.

452
00:24:29,750 --> 00:24:30,583
And think of the psychological impact of
that on the individual who chooses to 

453
00:24:37,161 --> 00:24:42,161
have a lifestyle that is not in sync 
with seventh century lifestyle.

454
00:24:43,380 --> 00:24:45,480
Right?
And that lifestyle,

455
00:24:45,481 --> 00:24:48,300
whether they're gay or a or just a 
woman,

456
00:24:49,040 --> 00:24:52,140
is what is what the progressive should 
always be fighting for.

457
00:24:52,141 --> 00:24:54,030
And that's the ultimate irony in this.

458
00:24:54,280 --> 00:24:56,600
The ultimate irony,
these women that I.

459
00:24:56,601 --> 00:24:57,434
I mean this is my background.
I wanted to be free to determine my own 

460
00:25:01,721 --> 00:25:03,280
destiny.
I didn't want to marry the man.

461
00:25:03,281 --> 00:25:06,640
I was first in to Mary.
I wanted to find my own mate in life.

462
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:10,730
I wanted to work and I wanted to finish 
my education and I was still.

463
00:25:10,731 --> 00:25:15,310
That's going to bring shame on us.
Now with the emphasis on us,

464
00:25:15,311 --> 00:25:16,810
that is the group,
the collective,

465
00:25:17,020 --> 00:25:19,660
so it's always you,
the individual,

466
00:25:19,661 --> 00:25:20,494
the unit,
and you're constantly being told you're 

467
00:25:22,751 --> 00:25:25,450
so selfish.
You're bringing down the whole family,

468
00:25:25,451 --> 00:25:29,130
the whole clan,
the whole group and a in.

469
00:25:29,250 --> 00:25:30,083
And here's the irony.
I think it used to be the left that 

470
00:25:34,180 --> 00:25:35,013
would take up the defense of the weak 
and now unfortunately we live in a time 

471
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:46,440
when it is the left that has decided to 
define week units as groups,

472
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:48,910
not individuals.

473
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:50,800
So,
so what can we do?

474
00:25:52,590 --> 00:25:54,400
So what can we do?
People,

475
00:25:54,430 --> 00:25:59,430
people in the public sphere with a voice
that care about people on the left.

476
00:25:59,620 --> 00:26:02,680
They're not even people I left that care
about liberal values.

477
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:03,793
What can we do?
Because when I see the tactics and the 

478
00:26:06,041 --> 00:26:08,830
way they treat you guys,
I even,

479
00:26:08,831 --> 00:26:10,690
I've asked this to Sam and Majid,
I said,

480
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:11,553
you know,
there must be this piece of you that 

481
00:26:12,071 --> 00:26:14,110
wants to get out and that's why I asked 
you to.

482
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:15,153
And I partly think that the reason that 
they do it is they want to do enough 

483
00:26:17,801 --> 00:26:21,490
damage to you guys and people like you 
so that everyone else.

484
00:26:21,491 --> 00:26:23,440
It's not about you.
You know what I mean?

485
00:26:23,441 --> 00:26:25,630
Like they'll get rid of you.
You'll just say,

486
00:26:25,631 --> 00:26:28,210
okay,
I can't do this anymore and that.

487
00:26:28,230 --> 00:26:31,120
But it's the chilling effect for 
everyone beneath you.

488
00:26:31,210 --> 00:26:32,800
So how,
how do we fight this?

489
00:26:33,610 --> 00:26:37,360
It's above the utopia.
I think what we have to do is we have to

490
00:26:37,390 --> 00:26:40,630
expose the fact that they are after a 
utopia,

491
00:26:40,631 --> 00:26:43,200
this whole justice thing,
the,

492
00:26:43,470 --> 00:26:46,200
you know,
life would be wonderful if we had to.

493
00:26:46,201 --> 00:26:47,580
Sharia law,
all of us.

494
00:26:47,581 --> 00:26:49,980
It's just uncovered their message really
would we?

495
00:26:50,900 --> 00:26:55,900
And I think if you are a liberal,
you have to revisit the basic principles

496
00:26:57,241 --> 00:26:59,850
of liberalism.
And it was about individuals.

497
00:27:00,090 --> 00:27:05,090
That is how the aristocracy was put in 
its place back then when there was,

498
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:06,833
you know,
I have all of these rights because I 

499
00:27:08,071 --> 00:27:12,840
happened to belong to this family and 
you're all surfs and you serve as,

500
00:27:12,841 --> 00:27:16,020
as aristocrats because you happen to 
belong to that collective.

501
00:27:16,170 --> 00:27:17,003
It wasn't about that.
It is about individual freedom when it 

502
00:27:19,381 --> 00:27:20,580
was about,
you know,

503
00:27:20,610 --> 00:27:21,443
fighting slavery,
you have to recognize the other person 

504
00:27:24,061 --> 00:27:24,894
who was the slave as a fellow human 
being and as an individual fighting for 

505
00:27:29,551 --> 00:27:30,270
women's rights.

506
00:27:30,270 --> 00:27:31,103
You had to recognize women as fellow 
individual human rights in human beings 

507
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:35,633
and the whole concept of human rights is
based on the individual and the freedom 

508
00:27:39,871 --> 00:27:40,704
of the individual and we know that we 
are social animals and are social 

509
00:27:43,681 --> 00:27:47,400
animals and as individuals within our 
families and within our communities,

510
00:27:47,550 --> 00:27:52,550
within our workplace,
we have to negotiate that sweet spot,

511
00:27:53,370 --> 00:27:54,203
that space where you can say,
I can be me and and this is how I can 

512
00:27:58,171 --> 00:28:00,870
serve my community and this is how my 
community can serve me,

513
00:28:00,990 --> 00:28:01,823
but all of that is not going to work if 
individual liberty is compromised and 

514
00:28:06,451 --> 00:28:10,260
unfortunately the people who have 
inherited these systems,

515
00:28:10,261 --> 00:28:12,900
America,
Europeans are the free countries.

516
00:28:13,230 --> 00:28:15,900
They're compromising that because they 
think it's so.

517
00:28:16,680 --> 00:28:19,920
There's this collective collective and 
this story,

518
00:28:19,921 --> 00:28:22,620
that narrative.
It is.

519
00:28:22,870 --> 00:28:25,490
Think it's.
They think it's a lofty goal somehow,

520
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:26,353
but I do.
I do.

521
00:28:26,540 --> 00:28:29,030
Do you sense that the tide is turning?
I feel like,

522
00:28:29,160 --> 00:28:29,993
you know,
the social justice warrior thing and 

523
00:28:31,610 --> 00:28:32,443
this whole movement,
I feel like it's been gaining strength 

524
00:28:34,340 --> 00:28:39,110
for the last five years,
but I do think partly because of Charlie

525
00:28:39,110 --> 00:28:44,020
Hebdo and sort of the general absurdity 
of so much of it online and you know,

526
00:28:44,120 --> 00:28:44,953
Brandeis University saying that they're 
not going to give you an honorary 

527
00:28:48,230 --> 00:28:49,460
doctorate.
I mean the,

528
00:28:49,470 --> 00:28:50,303
the height of absurdity to not give you 
an honorary doctorate after they said 

529
00:28:53,391 --> 00:28:54,224
they would do it.
That I do sense that the tide is 

530
00:28:56,121 --> 00:28:56,750
turning.
I.

531
00:28:56,750 --> 00:28:58,940
Am I just being optimistic there or do 
you feel that?

532
00:28:59,620 --> 00:29:00,453
I think what we're seeing is more and 
more confrontations that really 

533
00:29:04,631 --> 00:29:09,631
pronounce this,
this struggle and I think one of them is

534
00:29:13,300 --> 00:29:16,260
Israel versus the Arab Muslim world.
Uh,

535
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:18,370
he,
he is a liberal country.

536
00:29:18,371 --> 00:29:21,260
It's a democracy for goodness sake.
And,

537
00:29:21,350 --> 00:29:26,350
and we find a outside is telling them 
what they can and can't do.

538
00:29:27,180 --> 00:29:29,410
Who Do you know in the United States of 
America,

539
00:29:29,411 --> 00:29:33,010
if we had people throwing rocks at us,
knifing us.

540
00:29:33,011 --> 00:29:35,530
If you had the leadership of the 
opposition saying,

541
00:29:35,680 --> 00:29:36,850
you know,
take a knife,

542
00:29:36,890 --> 00:29:37,723
take a car,
take whatever weapon you can go after 

543
00:29:39,431 --> 00:29:40,264
them,
we would find it completely and deal 

544
00:29:42,101 --> 00:29:45,130
with it appropriately.
But when Israel desert,

545
00:29:45,310 --> 00:29:48,850
we demonized and vilified Israel.
So in a weird way,

546
00:29:48,980 --> 00:29:50,680
that's one way,
but that's one example.

547
00:29:50,681 --> 00:29:51,514
Yeah.
And then we have more examples and 

548
00:29:53,201 --> 00:29:56,830
you've mentioned magic and myself and 
all the other,

549
00:29:57,050 --> 00:29:57,920
uh,
what I,

550
00:29:57,921 --> 00:30:01,270
I don't know what is the right time to 
use Muslim reformers,

551
00:30:01,271 --> 00:30:03,490
Muslim modifiers,
Muslim heritage.

552
00:30:03,490 --> 00:30:06,790
I think that is the right word.
Heretic is you're on the inside,

553
00:30:06,791 --> 00:30:07,624
you start to ask questions and then 
you'll fight and shunned by this group 

554
00:30:11,290 --> 00:30:12,123
because they don't want to change or 
because they have an agenda for Sharia 

555
00:30:15,251 --> 00:30:16,084
and the Caliphate and Jihad and you 
stand up to that and then they'd go 

556
00:30:19,211 --> 00:30:20,044
after you.
So we're seeing so many of these 

557
00:30:21,611 --> 00:30:23,710
confrontations in so many different 
levels.

558
00:30:24,340 --> 00:30:27,490
And I think the mistake is that you 
know,

559
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:28,433
if,
if you're a socialist in the United 

560
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:30,593
States,
think you know you're a Bernie Sanders 

561
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:32,193
and you're hiding for president and you 
are Donald Trump and you're running for 

562
00:30:34,661 --> 00:30:35,494
president,
you can say the most ridiculous things 

563
00:30:36,791 --> 00:30:37,624
in the world.
Nobody's going to kill him and nobody 

564
00:30:40,091 --> 00:30:43,000
expects you to be killed.
And if you are attacked,

565
00:30:43,030 --> 00:30:46,330
if any violence against these two right 
now,

566
00:30:46,331 --> 00:30:50,440
these two extremes,
the American population is going to meet

567
00:30:50,441 --> 00:30:51,274
that with such rejection and it's going 
to be reviled and we have to teach the 

568
00:30:55,661 --> 00:31:00,580
rest of the world that it is possible to
disagree and to disagree radically,

569
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:03,910
but not use violence.
Less violence is used.

570
00:31:04,410 --> 00:31:05,243
That's an interesting thought because we
always think or I think that our system 

571
00:31:09,061 --> 00:31:12,420
is so broken here.
Our political system is so broken and we

572
00:31:12,421 --> 00:31:16,110
can't get things done properly in our 
discourse is so silly and cable news,

573
00:31:16,560 --> 00:31:18,570
but actually the way you just said that,
that look,

574
00:31:18,571 --> 00:31:21,930
you have these two people who were,
couldn't be further from each other.

575
00:31:21,931 --> 00:31:23,790
Trump and sanders,
the ultimate capitalist,

576
00:31:23,791 --> 00:31:26,730
the ultimate socialist,
and yet they're not.

577
00:31:26,731 --> 00:31:27,564
There is no threat.
There's no credible threat to their 

578
00:31:29,401 --> 00:31:30,031
lives.
Right?

579
00:31:30,031 --> 00:31:34,060
So that does show that we have something
pretty good about our,

580
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:37,050
our Western society.
I know it's not cool to say that,

581
00:31:37,051 --> 00:31:38,280
but that's the truth,
right?

582
00:31:38,850 --> 00:31:40,040
That's the truth.
And it's,

583
00:31:40,110 --> 00:31:40,943
it goes even more than that.
We also expect them to shake hands on 

584
00:31:44,371 --> 00:31:45,204
stage.
We expect them to be civil to one 

585
00:31:47,251 --> 00:31:49,890
another and they can disagree as much as
they like,

586
00:31:50,160 --> 00:31:52,710
but you know why he is the general 
public,

587
00:31:52,850 --> 00:31:54,690
uh,
say the establishment Republicans.

588
00:31:54,691 --> 00:31:58,020
Why are they angry with Donald trump?
I don't think it's because of his ideas.

589
00:31:58,050 --> 00:31:59,970
Sometimes just because of the way he 
speaks.

590
00:32:00,150 --> 00:32:03,330
That goes a little tool five gets too 
close to,

591
00:32:03,450 --> 00:32:05,850
you know,
uncivilized behavior,

592
00:32:06,450 --> 00:32:08,280
violent behavior.
Let's not do that.

593
00:32:08,310 --> 00:32:10,740
There is,
is a culture here where,

594
00:32:10,741 --> 00:32:11,820
yes,
people are violent.

595
00:32:12,030 --> 00:32:12,863
There's a lot of,
there are a lot of guns out there and 

596
00:32:14,641 --> 00:32:15,474
people use these guns,
but mainstream Americans expect 

597
00:32:19,080 --> 00:32:21,540
mainstream Americans to behave in a 
certain way.

598
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:26,850
And it's not a culture that says,
let's not disagree.

599
00:32:26,851 --> 00:32:27,990
We know we all disagree.

600
00:32:28,380 --> 00:32:31,740
Say the system is broken or it's the 
human being that's fragile.

601
00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:32,633
We disagree.
What we have is a system where you can 

602
00:32:36,571 --> 00:32:37,404
have these disagreements and these and 
you can change your mind or you can go 

603
00:32:41,121 --> 00:32:45,470
as radical as you please,
but you are not expected to use violence

604
00:32:45,740 --> 00:32:46,573
and the government is there to protect 
you and with people putting question 

605
00:32:50,511 --> 00:32:51,344
marks on the first amendment.
The two different things is one part of 

606
00:32:54,951 --> 00:32:57,350
it is you know,
we can disagree with one another as much

607
00:32:57,351 --> 00:32:59,510
as we like,
but there's a system here.

608
00:32:59,511 --> 00:33:03,980
There's an infrastructure that allows us
to disagree with one another without the

609
00:33:03,981 --> 00:33:04,814
use of violence.
If you start putting question marks on 

610
00:33:07,791 --> 00:33:10,550
the first amendment,
in other words,

611
00:33:10,560 --> 00:33:12,440
you know,
defamation laws,

612
00:33:12,910 --> 00:33:13,743
there are some religions or there are 
some icons that you may or may not 

613
00:33:16,641 --> 00:33:20,750
criticize.
Then you are really eroding the system.

614
00:33:20,930 --> 00:33:21,763
You're bringing down the system and this
system is superior to any other system 

615
00:33:26,930 --> 00:33:29,090
I've ever seen any other system in 
history.

616
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:30,193
So our job is,
and here's where people like you and me 

617
00:33:34,791 --> 00:33:35,624
and Sam and magic seeing it's.
We've got to be careful that the 

618
00:33:40,580 --> 00:33:41,413
government does not enact lows where 
some ideas cannot be criticized and 

619
00:33:47,271 --> 00:33:51,800
religion is just an idea.
It may be to you and everything,

620
00:33:52,250 --> 00:33:56,090
but to me it's just an idea and all 
ideas can be criticized.

621
00:33:56,150 --> 00:33:59,450
It makes your idea on the stronger,
but we're not.

622
00:33:59,480 --> 00:34:01,180
Yeah,
we must not challenge the.

623
00:34:01,650 --> 00:34:03,830
Doesn't erode the system that makes that
possible,

624
00:34:03,950 --> 00:34:04,783
so I'm.
I'm a first amendment fundamentalist if 

625
00:34:06,831 --> 00:34:07,664
you want.

626
00:34:08,080 --> 00:34:10,280
If you're going to be a fundamentalist 
of some kind,

627
00:34:10,300 --> 00:34:13,930
I suppose that that's the one to be so I
know a lot of people will,

628
00:34:14,060 --> 00:34:16,940
as I said earlier,
they'll call you and Islamophobia.

629
00:34:17,100 --> 00:34:20,300
They'll tell Majid who's Muslim and 
Islamophobia.

630
00:34:20,580 --> 00:34:23,270
What do you make of the meme of 
Islamophobia?

631
00:34:23,271 --> 00:34:24,104
Because at one time I feared that the 
government was going to come for our 

632
00:34:27,711 --> 00:34:29,930
free speech,
so infringing on our First Amendment.

633
00:34:29,931 --> 00:34:32,570
Bottom.
Now fearing is that we're taking it away

634
00:34:32,571 --> 00:34:33,404
from ourselves by what the universities 
are doing and by every debate ends in 

635
00:34:37,251 --> 00:34:39,230
someone being called a racist.
Right?

636
00:34:39,231 --> 00:34:41,690
We know what's happened to Sam that were
due.

637
00:34:41,691 --> 00:34:42,524
It's not the government,
but it's the use of words to stifle 

638
00:34:45,921 --> 00:34:46,754
debate.

639
00:34:47,020 --> 00:34:48,640
We're doing it ourselves.
You know?

640
00:34:48,641 --> 00:34:49,474
Uh,
when the Charlie Hebdo incident 

641
00:34:50,681 --> 00:34:51,514
happened,
I expected all newspapers in the free 

642
00:34:53,381 --> 00:34:54,880
world,
all televisions,

643
00:34:54,910 --> 00:34:55,743
the whole media,
to stand in solidarity with them and 

644
00:34:58,601 --> 00:35:01,720
republish those cartoons to show them 
this is what we do.

645
00:35:01,721 --> 00:35:03,610
This is what we are about.
It's an idea.

646
00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:07,540
And the Islamophobia meme,
if you want to,

647
00:35:07,570 --> 00:35:08,690
first of all,
you know,

648
00:35:08,691 --> 00:35:09,524
to,
to criticize an idea is not to be 

649
00:35:10,650 --> 00:35:12,940
phobic.
Islam is a religion.

650
00:35:12,941 --> 00:35:14,740
It's a faith.
It's a set of beliefs.

651
00:35:14,741 --> 00:35:16,450
It's an idea.
It's not the people.

652
00:35:16,660 --> 00:35:21,040
Muslims are very diverse and many of 
them disagree on many things,

653
00:35:21,100 --> 00:35:24,970
including the position of Muhammad,
including whether Marvin should be drawn

654
00:35:24,971 --> 00:35:26,380
or not drawn,
criticized,

655
00:35:26,500 --> 00:35:28,870
not criticized.
So given all of that,

656
00:35:29,110 --> 00:35:29,943
yes,
you're right.

657
00:35:29,950 --> 00:35:31,870
It's not only the government,
we shouldn't,

658
00:35:32,140 --> 00:35:37,140
of course the government is lobbied by 
57 member nations of the Organization of

659
00:35:39,720 --> 00:35:40,553
Islamic Conference that through the 
United Nations and other international 

660
00:35:42,991 --> 00:35:43,824
bodies is trying to make them adopt laws
that leave Islam out of that realm and 

661
00:35:53,140 --> 00:35:57,720
discussing ideas and criticizing ideas.
But it's not only that we're doing it to

662
00:35:57,721 --> 00:36:00,060
ourselves,
schools are doing it,

663
00:36:00,090 --> 00:36:02,020
the education system,
um,

664
00:36:02,630 --> 00:36:04,440
the press,
um,

665
00:36:04,980 --> 00:36:05,813
even individually,
I think that some of it is because we 

666
00:36:08,011 --> 00:36:09,750
are scared because we think,
you know,

667
00:36:09,751 --> 00:36:12,930
we don't want it to be,
we don't want to be short,

668
00:36:12,931 --> 00:36:13,890
we don't want to be killed,

669
00:36:13,990 --> 00:36:15,370
which is just what they want,
right?

670
00:36:15,371 --> 00:36:17,590
They want the.
Because the fear is as powerful,

671
00:36:17,591 --> 00:36:20,890
if not more powerful perhaps than,
than murdering somebody.

672
00:36:20,891 --> 00:36:21,690
Right?

673
00:36:21,690 --> 00:36:23,010
Absolutely.
Absolutely.

674
00:36:23,011 --> 00:36:25,890
That's the whole point of terrorism is 
to.

675
00:36:26,180 --> 00:36:28,440
They want to get what they want.
So this is.

676
00:36:28,710 --> 00:36:29,543
So I would like to promote the idea that
men and women are equal and should be 

677
00:36:35,101 --> 00:36:35,934
equal before the law.
I want to get into every Muslim 

678
00:36:38,611 --> 00:36:42,210
community and promote that idea and I 
know it's an uphill battle,

679
00:36:42,870 --> 00:36:43,703
but for me to do that,
my life is not safe enough for the 

680
00:36:48,931 --> 00:36:49,764
Islamic extremists.
They wanted to promote the idea among 

681
00:36:53,010 --> 00:36:57,720
Muslim American citizens and others that
women and men should behave in a certain

682
00:36:57,721 --> 00:36:58,554
way.
They can take advantage of all the 

683
00:37:01,051 --> 00:37:02,790
freedoms that we have,
freedom of religion,

684
00:37:02,820 --> 00:37:05,640
of association of expression.
And I give them that,

685
00:37:07,100 --> 00:37:07,933
why can't I do the same,
why is my government not protecting me 

686
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:12,113
to promote my message,
which is 100 percent aligned with our 

687
00:37:15,571 --> 00:37:16,404
constitution.

688
00:37:16,840 --> 00:37:19,870
Yeah.
It's so fascinating because it's so many

689
00:37:19,871 --> 00:37:22,090
levels of,
of craziness.

690
00:37:22,091 --> 00:37:22,990
I,
I suppose.

691
00:37:23,300 --> 00:37:24,133
Um,
so I think part of the issue also is 

692
00:37:25,841 --> 00:37:29,920
that people get a little lost in the,
in the definition of terms.

693
00:37:30,230 --> 00:37:31,063
Um,
so could you explain the difference 

694
00:37:32,741 --> 00:37:33,574
between the doctrine of Islam?
So sort of the religious side of it 

695
00:37:37,330 --> 00:37:38,163
versus what political Islam is.
Because I think that that split in 

696
00:37:41,321 --> 00:37:44,320
itself I think has many people very 
confused.

697
00:37:44,500 --> 00:37:45,333
And that's why I'm trying to use this 
show to get people just to understand 

698
00:37:47,291 --> 00:37:48,124
the basic tenants of all this stuff 
because maybe that will remove a bit of 

699
00:37:51,971 --> 00:37:54,970
where everyone says this is about 
bigotry and racism and things like that.

700
00:37:55,350 --> 00:37:58,820
Okay.
So in the seventh century,

701
00:37:58,850 --> 00:38:01,160
a man called Mohammed comes with a 
message.

702
00:38:01,190 --> 00:38:04,000
So man,
Mohammed the message,

703
00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:04,993
submit to one God,
forget about all your other got submits 

704
00:38:07,420 --> 00:38:08,090
to a,
my God,

705
00:38:08,090 --> 00:38:08,923
the one who spoke to me and they're in 
that cave called a hero and a bunch of 

706
00:38:14,180 --> 00:38:18,590
people say this mighty is crazy,
what are going to abandon our gods?

707
00:38:19,400 --> 00:38:21,920
And he carries on.
So for the first 10 years,

708
00:38:22,220 --> 00:38:23,053
what he is preaching is my God requires 
you to pray too fast to look after the 

709
00:38:28,851 --> 00:38:30,230
poor,
to be charitable.

710
00:38:30,650 --> 00:38:31,483
A lot of the things he was saying in 
those fast 10 years would fall under 

711
00:38:34,791 --> 00:38:39,310
what you and I and a lot of Americans 
and Europeans understand as religion.

712
00:38:39,610 --> 00:38:42,640
You believe in these things and maybe 
something good will happen.

713
00:38:42,641 --> 00:38:44,560
Maybe something good,
you know you can mobilize.

714
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:46,900
If you look after the orphans,
I mean what's wrong with that?

715
00:38:48,220 --> 00:38:49,280
That's great,
right?

716
00:38:50,350 --> 00:38:51,183
And then the next 10 years of his life,
he moves from Mecca to a place called 

717
00:38:54,971 --> 00:38:59,830
Medina and he starts to put together a 
militia and he starts to wage war.

718
00:39:00,130 --> 00:39:04,520
Small wars that he wins that get bigger 
and he starts to concrete and concrete.

719
00:39:04,540 --> 00:39:05,373
Of course,
all that goes to his head and from then 

720
00:39:08,201 --> 00:39:10,720
on the second 10 years of Mohammed's 
life,

721
00:39:10,750 --> 00:39:14,980
that's when political Islam comes about.
On the first 10 years he was saying,

722
00:39:15,190 --> 00:39:19,210
please reconsider.
Think about having all these many,

723
00:39:19,211 --> 00:39:21,430
many gods.
Give them a come to my one.

724
00:39:21,431 --> 00:39:25,270
Gordon would be your choice to do it 
from Medina onwards.

725
00:39:25,360 --> 00:39:26,193
You had to do it had to happen at the 
tip of a sword and every victory 

726
00:39:30,310 --> 00:39:31,143
strengthened him and his followers in 
doing that and that happened for 

727
00:39:34,121 --> 00:39:34,954
centuries afterwards.
So a lot of the people today who are 

728
00:39:38,651 --> 00:39:43,651
using Islam as a political tool to get 
people to do what they want them to do.

729
00:39:44,820 --> 00:39:47,830
A following Muhammad in this example.
That is.

730
00:39:48,010 --> 00:39:48,843
That is why Mohammed is relevant.
That's why he needs to be discussed to 

731
00:39:52,421 --> 00:39:54,310
be drawn.
Who was he?

732
00:39:54,430 --> 00:39:57,400
Did he really live?
Is this really what he said?

733
00:39:57,550 --> 00:40:00,780
If he said so,
was it really more moral?

734
00:40:01,780 --> 00:40:04,870
We should discuss Mohammed the way we 
discuss Hannibal,

735
00:40:07,360 --> 00:40:10,000
Julius Caesar,
you know this will water is of the past.

736
00:40:10,840 --> 00:40:11,673
They Alexander the Great.
They established all these empires and 

737
00:40:15,551 --> 00:40:20,320
then now the historical figures.
That's how and it can we,

738
00:40:20,380 --> 00:40:21,213
can we do that in 21st century America 
without having our own demand around me 

739
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:30,580
all the time without fearing for our 
lives.

740
00:40:32,130 --> 00:40:34,110
Unfortunately,
I know that the answer is to that,

741
00:40:34,200 --> 00:40:36,840
and by the way,
a lot of people on the left,

742
00:40:36,900 --> 00:40:38,580
liberals,
well intentioned,

743
00:40:38,640 --> 00:40:41,850
wonderful,
wealthy liberals think that the way that

744
00:40:41,851 --> 00:40:42,684
they can make Muslims as a minority feel
at home in America is by respecting the 

745
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:49,793
icon and I think the best respect that 
they can pay to the icon is to put him 

746
00:40:54,871 --> 00:40:57,120
along with all those other icons of the 
past.

747
00:40:57,840 --> 00:40:58,673
Isn't that what Bill Maher refers to 
that as the soft bigotry of low 

748
00:41:02,061 --> 00:41:06,560
expectations that somehow we have to 
treat these people differently.

749
00:41:06,920 --> 00:41:08,060
I want,
you know,

750
00:41:08,061 --> 00:41:11,120
I want everyone to be treated as Shitty 
as everyone else.

751
00:41:11,270 --> 00:41:12,103
It's about treating them well.
Treat everyone equally crappy that will 

752
00:41:14,661 --> 00:41:15,494
be good for me

753
00:41:15,750 --> 00:41:17,050
and,
and bail my,

754
00:41:17,120 --> 00:41:17,760
his,
you know,

755
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:18,593
his own clients.
He is one of those few liberals who is 

756
00:41:21,451 --> 00:41:22,284
saying,
I'm not going to make an exception for 

757
00:41:24,181 --> 00:41:27,030
my fellow American sentiment.
Why would I?

758
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:28,033
I want them to be.
I see them as equals and he knows there 

759
00:41:31,591 --> 00:41:36,050
are a lot of Muslim Americans laugh at 
his jokes and who love him,

760
00:41:37,020 --> 00:41:37,853
but they have to hide that from the 
Islamic extremists inside of their 

761
00:41:41,331 --> 00:41:43,700
families and their communities.
So that's.

762
00:41:44,060 --> 00:41:44,893
Yeah.
And it's our job to emancipate them by 

763
00:41:46,401 --> 00:41:46,990
saying I'm,
I,

764
00:41:46,990 --> 00:41:47,823
I,
I'm not in Pakistan or Afghanistan or 

765
00:41:49,770 --> 00:41:50,603
Somali or Egypt.
I'm now in America probably in La and I 

766
00:41:53,751 --> 00:41:55,820
want to laugh at my luck.
His jokes.

767
00:41:55,930 --> 00:41:57,920
Yeah.
That's the crazy part,

768
00:41:57,921 --> 00:41:58,754
right?
That Bill Maher when it comes to this 

769
00:42:00,591 --> 00:42:03,860
discussion,
is really being treated like a pariah by

770
00:42:03,861 --> 00:42:05,480
the regressive left and they're calling 
him.

771
00:42:05,481 --> 00:42:06,314
And Sam,
of course racist because of that whole 

772
00:42:08,061 --> 00:42:10,220
Ben Affleck thing.
But we've spent so much time on that.

773
00:42:10,221 --> 00:42:12,290
I don't want to get into that 
specifically,

774
00:42:12,340 --> 00:42:13,790
but,
but look what they've done to build.

775
00:42:14,370 --> 00:42:19,170
I want to say why,
why doesn't Ben Afleck play the parts of

776
00:42:19,171 --> 00:42:21,000
Mohammed the grade or something like 
that.

777
00:42:22,010 --> 00:42:22,970
That would be something,
right?

778
00:42:22,971 --> 00:42:25,340
He had no problem playing a fallen angel
in dogma,

779
00:42:25,341 --> 00:42:26,174
which was all about Christianity.
But I guess it's a little different in 

780
00:42:30,021 --> 00:42:31,250
this case.
Um,

781
00:42:31,340 --> 00:42:32,090
so,
uh,

782
00:42:32,090 --> 00:42:32,923
one of the,
one of the other things when I tweeted 

783
00:42:34,161 --> 00:42:38,270
about you was that a couple people said,
how could you have her on?

784
00:42:38,271 --> 00:42:43,271
She's a neo-con that the urine neo-con 
are you neo-con ion.

785
00:42:45,760 --> 00:42:46,593
What if,
if somebody explained to me was an near 

786
00:42:48,270 --> 00:42:51,000
Connie's,
I might decide to be any record or not.

787
00:42:51,460 --> 00:42:52,670
All right?
So I think,

788
00:42:52,671 --> 00:42:56,530
I think what people are saying is that 
the neocons,

789
00:42:56,540 --> 00:42:59,600
they really think of the neocons as the 
sort of George Bush,

790
00:42:59,601 --> 00:43:03,860
Donald Rumsfeld,
Dick Cheney nation builders.

791
00:43:03,861 --> 00:43:07,910
This idea that America can exert its 
influence to nation build.

792
00:43:08,060 --> 00:43:10,400
And I think they,
they lump you in on that.

793
00:43:10,660 --> 00:43:12,590
Um,
take it away.

794
00:43:13,130 --> 00:43:13,963
It's a position in felt foreign policy 
that if you are going to intervene and 

795
00:43:19,720 --> 00:43:22,940
uh,
and you remember right after 9:11,

796
00:43:23,040 --> 00:43:24,360
you know,
if we go out to,

797
00:43:24,370 --> 00:43:25,203
as the United States of America,
we know we've been attacked from 

798
00:43:27,171 --> 00:43:30,320
Afghanistan.
We get into the affairs of that country.

799
00:43:30,650 --> 00:43:33,920
How do we leave it now?
There were people who were saying,

800
00:43:33,921 --> 00:43:34,754
we don't just go in and destroy and get 
the bad guys and get out because we 

801
00:43:39,921 --> 00:43:43,160
leave the situation far worse than we 
found it.

802
00:43:43,310 --> 00:43:48,310
We have a responsibility to rebuild and 
it's going to cost us a lot of blood and

803
00:43:48,921 --> 00:43:50,930
treasure.
If those are the neocons,

804
00:43:50,960 --> 00:43:51,793
count me in on them.
The fact that such a thing is really 

805
00:43:54,201 --> 00:43:55,034
quite murky and it takes a long time,
but I find that position to be more 

806
00:43:59,121 --> 00:43:59,954
noble than the position we are in now,
where we're going to go and get rid of 

807
00:44:04,360 --> 00:44:09,360
the feet and degrade and defeat isis by 
bringing together people who really have

808
00:44:10,941 --> 00:44:15,941
never fought and have them be defeated 
and offer some airpower and just mock it

809
00:44:16,821 --> 00:44:17,990
up and muddle through.

810
00:44:18,230 --> 00:44:22,070
When the neocons were in charge.
If that is president George W Bush,

811
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:23,833
he did make huge mistakes early on,
but after the surge in Iraq was under 

812
00:44:27,741 --> 00:44:30,200
control and the rats lived in relative 
fees,

813
00:44:30,290 --> 00:44:31,123
we didn't have to pull out.
These are political positions and this 

814
00:44:34,620 --> 00:44:35,453
is policy and you can say,
what do you like about the marriage of 

815
00:44:38,701 --> 00:44:41,850
the policy?
But I think it is wrong to put labels on

816
00:44:41,851 --> 00:44:45,060
their foreheads,
of people as neocons and this and that.

817
00:44:45,061 --> 00:44:45,894
It's not.
There are a bunch of people who thought 

818
00:44:47,580 --> 00:44:50,460
about what would happen after you leave 
the place.

819
00:44:50,580 --> 00:44:51,480
Uh,
and,

820
00:44:51,620 --> 00:44:55,470
and again,
I still think it's more responsible once

821
00:44:55,471 --> 00:44:56,304
you invade a place to stay there until 
things are in order instead of pulling 

822
00:45:00,091 --> 00:45:02,400
out two,
three years into it.

823
00:45:02,550 --> 00:45:04,470
Right.
And I guess that's the irony is that,

824
00:45:04,471 --> 00:45:05,304
you know,
we know in retrospect that the Iraq war 

825
00:45:07,620 --> 00:45:09,720
was based on faulty logic,
but when,

826
00:45:09,750 --> 00:45:13,440
when we were there,
it was better than it is now.

827
00:45:13,441 --> 00:45:17,310
And that's just a sad reality and that 
doesn't mean we should be there forever.

828
00:45:17,640 --> 00:45:18,121
But,
you know,

829
00:45:18,121 --> 00:45:20,370
we look at the United States,
we're in this weird thing,

830
00:45:20,371 --> 00:45:21,600
we do things,
people hate us,

831
00:45:21,601 --> 00:45:23,370
we don't do things and look what's 
happening now.

832
00:45:24,730 --> 00:45:25,940
Yeah.
So I guess that gets you right.

833
00:45:25,950 --> 00:45:26,783
They hate us anyway.
And I guess that gets your point about 

834
00:45:27,631 --> 00:45:29,100
labels.
I'm so sorry.

835
00:45:29,370 --> 00:45:32,120
It's also about policies.
If you're in,

836
00:45:32,290 --> 00:45:37,130
and maybe I can't blame it for people 
who haven't been,

837
00:45:37,160 --> 00:45:38,270
you know,
in parliamentary,

838
00:45:38,470 --> 00:45:40,580
in poly,
whoever want to involved in policy,

839
00:45:40,940 --> 00:45:44,690
every single policy has consequences,
intended consequences,

840
00:45:44,720 --> 00:45:46,490
unintended consequences,
you name it.

841
00:45:46,730 --> 00:45:47,563
So it's all about the positions you take
around these policy issues in the 

842
00:45:51,140 --> 00:45:51,973
position you take around a policy issue 
should not define who you are and I 

843
00:45:56,541 --> 00:45:57,374
think people who then start coming up 
with these names of neo-con this and 

844
00:46:02,210 --> 00:46:03,043
take it from the policy to the person 
they are from their militias and the 

845
00:46:06,421 --> 00:46:07,254
acting in bad faith.

846
00:46:07,350 --> 00:46:08,183
Yeah,
and the part of that that particularly 

847
00:46:09,031 --> 00:46:13,350
bothers me is that they think if they 
can label you with that or whatever that

848
00:46:13,351 --> 00:46:14,184
label is,
that then they can extrapolate every 

849
00:46:15,721 --> 00:46:16,554
other idea that you think and they think
they understand every other decision 

850
00:46:21,151 --> 00:46:23,160
that you make,
which you so rarely the case.

851
00:46:23,161 --> 00:46:23,994
Many of us believe in many conflicting 
things or have liberal values and 

852
00:46:26,821 --> 00:46:29,040
libertarian values and so on

853
00:46:29,920 --> 00:46:34,920
that plus they also distract the 
weaknesses of their policy position.

854
00:46:35,610 --> 00:46:38,520
So it's all about not having to discuss 
the merits and demerits.

855
00:46:38,790 --> 00:46:39,623
I don't care if my opponent's position,
so I discussed the letter and I know 

856
00:46:42,091 --> 00:46:44,550
that they'll have weaknesses and they'll
have strengths,

857
00:46:44,790 --> 00:46:45,623
but in order to discuss the policy 
position to polish the proposal of the 

858
00:46:48,001 --> 00:46:50,280
other person,
I would never call him this or that.

859
00:46:50,950 --> 00:46:52,710
It has to be about the policy.

860
00:46:52,930 --> 00:46:54,500
Yeah.
Well it'd be your,

861
00:46:54,580 --> 00:46:55,413
your,
what I would refer to as a true liberal 

862
00:46:56,441 --> 00:46:57,274
and willing to debate the ideas.
So I know we only have about 10 minutes 

863
00:46:59,381 --> 00:47:02,410
left and I wanted to discuss one thing 
with you because I saw you.

864
00:47:02,710 --> 00:47:03,543
I was probably about six months ago now 
on the daily show when Jon Stewart was 

865
00:47:06,821 --> 00:47:10,330
still there and I interned at the daily 
show in 1999.

866
00:47:10,331 --> 00:47:11,350
John is,
you know,

867
00:47:11,351 --> 00:47:12,184
we've met a couple of times and he's 
given me some great advice about comedy 

868
00:47:14,201 --> 00:47:16,930
and life and I love John just like 
everyone else loves John.

869
00:47:17,530 --> 00:47:18,363
That said,
I thought his interview with you was 

870
00:47:20,800 --> 00:47:21,633
really terrible.
I thought every time you brought up 

871
00:47:25,451 --> 00:47:26,284
something about Islam again,
coming from the history that you come 

872
00:47:28,721 --> 00:47:30,130
from,
from your life,

873
00:47:30,131 --> 00:47:34,330
your firsthand experience.
Every time you said something,

874
00:47:34,331 --> 00:47:36,970
he immediately brought it back to 
Christianity.

875
00:47:37,120 --> 00:47:38,080
He immediately said,
well,

876
00:47:38,081 --> 00:47:41,230
Christianity did this stuff and you're 
focusing on Islam and I,

877
00:47:41,231 --> 00:47:44,770
and it really was that regressive thing 
that we started this conversation about.

878
00:47:45,130 --> 00:47:46,240
Um,
so a,

879
00:47:46,241 --> 00:47:50,170
do you agree that it was a sort of messy
interview a and B,

880
00:47:50,171 --> 00:47:51,810
were you shocked?
Because I,

881
00:47:51,970 --> 00:47:52,803
I would think everything being equal 
that you would sit down with this guy 

882
00:47:55,151 --> 00:47:55,984
and he would absolutely love you.
You stand for every liberal value and 

883
00:47:58,451 --> 00:48:00,640
women's rights and equality and all 
that.

884
00:48:00,641 --> 00:48:02,560
And I thought it was really terrible.

885
00:48:04,170 --> 00:48:07,770
It wasn't funny.
It definitely wasn't funny.

886
00:48:07,771 --> 00:48:08,690
Oh yeah,
for sure.

887
00:48:08,700 --> 00:48:10,380
Isn't funny.
It wasn't funny.

888
00:48:10,470 --> 00:48:11,303
And the reason why it wasn't funny,
it was probably because it was about 

889
00:48:14,280 --> 00:48:17,730
Islam and Islam is not funny at the 
moment.

890
00:48:18,090 --> 00:48:18,923
And I don't know what it goes.
I can't speculate on what the see what 

891
00:48:21,990 --> 00:48:23,850
somebody work,
but you know,

892
00:48:23,950 --> 00:48:28,150
imagine if the next morning he gets a 
threat,

893
00:48:28,210 --> 00:48:30,480
he gets whatever,
you know,

894
00:48:30,481 --> 00:48:33,120
people telling him that he hasn't 
treated them fairly.

895
00:48:33,210 --> 00:48:35,330
You can't laugh at Islam.
There's nothing funny.

896
00:48:35,450 --> 00:48:36,211
I mean,
I can,

897
00:48:36,211 --> 00:48:37,044
I can make a lot of comedy about the 
absurdities of Islam and all the sad 

898
00:48:41,401 --> 00:48:43,110
things that are done in the name of 
Islam,

899
00:48:43,440 --> 00:48:48,440
but nowadays that comes laced with 
threats laced with resentment.

900
00:48:49,470 --> 00:48:51,370
So it wasn't a funny show.
Uh,

901
00:48:51,440 --> 00:48:52,520
I don't,
um,

902
00:48:52,760 --> 00:48:56,010
I mean in hindsight I asked myself why 
he even agreed to it.

903
00:48:56,640 --> 00:48:57,940
Uh,
but it,

904
00:48:57,941 --> 00:48:59,360
it is for him.
He's,

905
00:48:59,390 --> 00:49:00,223
he's an adult and he,
he will probably have his own 

906
00:49:02,791 --> 00:49:04,430
explanations in his own lesson.

907
00:49:04,530 --> 00:49:05,140
Yeah.
Listen,

908
00:49:05,140 --> 00:49:05,973
I,
I know that saying anything negative or 

909
00:49:07,441 --> 00:49:10,290
whatever about John is not going to win 
me any Brownie points,

910
00:49:10,500 --> 00:49:11,333
but I thought that because not only was 
the tone of it unnecessarily combative 

911
00:49:14,611 --> 00:49:18,330
as opposed to just listening to you,
but then at the end he said something to

912
00:49:18,331 --> 00:49:20,520
the effect as he was saying goodbye to 
you,

913
00:49:20,790 --> 00:49:21,740
like basically like,
ah,

914
00:49:21,750 --> 00:49:22,583
you just want to sell some books.
And I really thought it was just 

915
00:49:24,451 --> 00:49:25,284
incredibly dismissive.
And of course you kept your calm and 

916
00:49:27,031 --> 00:49:27,864
your cool and all of that.

917
00:49:27,980 --> 00:49:28,813
Well,
that's funny because people go to John 

918
00:49:30,141 --> 00:49:30,974
who had books,
just sell books and sell a bunch of 

919
00:49:34,701 --> 00:49:35,780
books,
but that is,

920
00:49:35,781 --> 00:49:36,614
I mean,
I think what he did it to a certain 

921
00:49:38,061 --> 00:49:43,061
degree was put himself in the shoes of 
my opponents and in doing so,

922
00:49:44,150 --> 00:49:44,983
I think the people,
he entertained a thought that this is 

923
00:49:47,691 --> 00:49:49,130
not entertaining,
this is not funny.

924
00:49:49,270 --> 00:49:50,280
Yeah.
Yeah.

925
00:49:50,370 --> 00:49:51,250
Interesting.
All right.

926
00:49:51,440 --> 00:49:53,740
I think that's the west view.
You can give comedia.

927
00:49:54,210 --> 00:49:55,500
Yeah,
exactly.

928
00:49:55,890 --> 00:49:56,331
All right.
So,

929
00:49:56,331 --> 00:49:57,450
uh,
so I have one more for you,

930
00:49:57,451 --> 00:50:00,150
that sort.
I want to try to tie this altogether.

931
00:50:00,151 --> 00:50:01,140
So,
uh,

932
00:50:01,340 --> 00:50:03,370
you know,
you alluded to security threats that,

933
00:50:03,450 --> 00:50:05,280
that you still have,
you know,

934
00:50:05,281 --> 00:50:07,170
your life story as we've said.
It's just,

935
00:50:07,230 --> 00:50:09,300
it's just incredible and an inspiration.
I think,

936
00:50:09,660 --> 00:50:12,480
um,
Gimme something to end this,

937
00:50:12,481 --> 00:50:16,430
that we can all feel good about the 
direction that this is going.

938
00:50:16,520 --> 00:50:17,353
You know,
we've talked a little bit about how the 

939
00:50:18,271 --> 00:50:19,104
voices are finally raising up in the 
liberal community against the 

940
00:50:23,191 --> 00:50:26,940
regressives and I think a lot of my 
audience take solace in that.

941
00:50:27,140 --> 00:50:27,650
Um,
but,

942
00:50:27,650 --> 00:50:28,483
but give me something that you from 
everything that you've lived through 

943
00:50:31,620 --> 00:50:35,580
that you can really help us all take 
with us and feel good and feel like,

944
00:50:35,940 --> 00:50:39,230
feel like we can,
we can win for the right reasons and the

945
00:50:39,231 --> 00:50:40,064
right principles.

946
00:50:40,710 --> 00:50:41,543
Well,
I mean the best news I have at the 

947
00:50:42,361 --> 00:50:43,194
moment is just the sheer number of 
individuals who are born into Muslim 

948
00:50:47,131 --> 00:50:51,990
households who are rejecting the 
absolute is submission narrative.

949
00:50:52,040 --> 00:50:52,873
He was saying,
I think I don't like it if it comes to 

950
00:50:56,101 --> 00:50:59,760
choosing between my conscience and what 
Mohammed tells me to do.

951
00:50:59,940 --> 00:51:03,000
I go with my conscience and people are 
paying with their lives.

952
00:51:03,090 --> 00:51:08,090
I've talked about as much as I can,
a battery in Saudi Arabia of all.

953
00:51:08,290 --> 00:51:13,290
Can you imagine living in Saudi Arabia 
and somehow finding the intellectually,

954
00:51:15,660 --> 00:51:16,493
the capacity to say no to all this and 
stand up for a message of freedom and 

955
00:51:22,561 --> 00:51:23,394
rationality and reason and science and 
then having to deal with the 

956
00:51:26,041 --> 00:51:26,874
consequences.
This man is sentenced to a thousand 

957
00:51:28,201 --> 00:51:29,940
lashes.
50 of them have been carried out,

958
00:51:30,210 --> 00:51:34,560
is fighting for his life inside prison.
Now he is an icon,

959
00:51:35,430 --> 00:51:36,263
but he's only one of what I now see as 
thousands and I see them everywhere 

960
00:51:40,650 --> 00:51:44,460
because the emails I get,
I'm so heartened by that,

961
00:51:44,490 --> 00:51:49,060
and 10 years ago it was the opposite.
Every single Muslim who called me,

962
00:51:49,080 --> 00:51:50,940
he just called me an infidel and told 
me,

963
00:51:51,060 --> 00:51:53,230
you deserve to die,
and now people are saying,

964
00:51:53,400 --> 00:51:54,810
oh my God,
you are.

965
00:51:54,860 --> 00:51:56,970
You're my hero.
We're in this together.

966
00:51:57,180 --> 00:51:59,400
And some of them still identify as 
Muslim.

967
00:51:59,401 --> 00:52:01,980
They're not necessarily out,
but they are.

968
00:52:02,490 --> 00:52:06,510
They're thinking and you and me and all 
the other liberals,

969
00:52:06,780 --> 00:52:10,590
the one thing we can advance is the idea
of critical thinking.

970
00:52:10,591 --> 00:52:13,440
Let's just give people whether they're 
Muslim or not,

971
00:52:14,070 --> 00:52:14,903
the ability,
I mean just enhance their ability to 

972
00:52:18,121 --> 00:52:19,860
think critically about these things.

973
00:52:20,560 --> 00:52:21,490
Yeah,
I love that.

974
00:52:21,491 --> 00:52:21,870
I mean,
I,

975
00:52:21,870 --> 00:52:22,703
that's,
that's pretty much what I've tried to 

976
00:52:23,771 --> 00:52:25,610
now make my life about and it's clearly 
what,

977
00:52:25,870 --> 00:52:26,703
what you've done.
So really this has been truly a thrill 

978
00:52:28,960 --> 00:52:30,580
to spend a little time with you and I 
hope,

979
00:52:30,760 --> 00:52:32,860
I know you're not going to be in la 
probably for a couple months,

980
00:52:32,861 --> 00:52:35,260
but I hope we can do it in person next 
time.

981
00:52:35,870 --> 00:52:36,703
Thank you so much.
Thank you for having me and David and 

982
00:52:38,211 --> 00:52:39,044
good luck with this,
with this show and keep up the good 

983
00:52:40,491 --> 00:52:41,000
work.

984
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:42,140
Thank you.
Likewise.

985
00:52:42,170 --> 00:52:45,500
Uh Alright.
Well you guys can buy ions book.

986
00:52:45,501 --> 00:52:48,830
It's called heretic A.
Pretty much wherever books are sold.

987
00:52:48,831 --> 00:52:49,664
Where do you want them to buy it though?
Do you have a place you want to send 

988
00:52:50,931 --> 00:52:51,764
them?

989
00:52:52,820 --> 00:52:57,590
I don't know.
I mean it's by whatever you can find it.

990
00:52:57,591 --> 00:52:59,090
Whatever's convenient for you.
I guess

991
00:53:00,660 --> 00:53:02,090
a nice message at the end.
Alright,

992
00:53:02,170 --> 00:53:03,560
great.
Well thank you so much diane.

993
00:53:03,570 --> 00:53:04,450
I really appreciate it.

994
00:53:05,140 --> 00:53:06,550
Thank you very much.
Thank you for having me.
