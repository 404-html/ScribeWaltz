00:00:21,810 --> 00:00:26,810
anthem,

12
00:00:31,950 --> 00:00:34,950
a former rapper Jesse Itzler.
Welcome to the Rubin report.

13
00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:36,500
Thanks for having me,
dude.

14
00:00:36,510 --> 00:00:41,510
Your bio is like,
like it doesn't even seem like it could 

15
00:00:41,510 --> 00:00:44,100
possibly be real.
It's been quite a journey.

16
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,850
Quite a journey.
There's so much I want to do with you.

17
00:00:47,851 --> 00:00:52,851
I said to you right before we started,
I mean I remember that 94 nick's team so

18
00:00:53,011 --> 00:00:56,640
well that was like right in my formative
years of basketball,

19
00:00:56,790 --> 00:01:01,790
which I love.
I said to you right before we started 

20
00:01:01,790 --> 00:01:02,850
that that game six,
which as an expat is probably one of the

21
00:01:02,851 --> 00:01:07,851
most painful things you ever watched.
A was the night of my senior prom and of

22
00:01:08,311 --> 00:01:10,110
course the night of the Oj Simpson car 
chase.

23
00:01:10,111 --> 00:01:12,390
You lived through that whole experience.

24
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:14,100
I did.
I was at the Knick game that night.

25
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:15,920
I was at the Knick game.
It was a playoff game.

26
00:01:15,921 --> 00:01:20,921
I just written the theme song for the 
Knicks and started was starting to get 

27
00:01:20,921 --> 00:01:23,220
momentum on the radio and in the garden 
and I was so,

28
00:01:23,221 --> 00:01:28,221
I mean my whole life up a knick fan and 
it also was a big moment and here we 

29
00:01:28,221 --> 00:01:31,770
are,
game six at home and all of a sudden the

30
00:01:31,770 --> 00:01:32,970
Oj Chase,
I was getting like a pretzel.

31
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:38,240
I went outside,
I was just looking at the monitor and I 

32
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:38,240
looked up.
I'm like,

33
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:38,790
what in the world is this?
Oh Wow.

34
00:01:38,791 --> 00:01:41,290
So they were showing you don't go out to
the concessions.

35
00:01:42,290 --> 00:01:43,980
It was on the Monitor.
So you know,

36
00:01:44,070 --> 00:01:46,830
I was conflicted and people were running
back and forth.

37
00:01:46,831 --> 00:01:47,430
It was wild.

38
00:01:47,530 --> 00:01:49,760
Yeah.
What a crazy night because the,

39
00:01:49,870 --> 00:01:53,050
the rangers had just won the Stanley Cup
finals I think,

40
00:01:53,290 --> 00:01:55,240
and it was just like a great time to be 
in New York.

41
00:01:55,241 --> 00:02:00,241
Then Oj obviously people must've been 
talking about my prom so I can only 

42
00:02:00,241 --> 00:02:00,670
imagine what was going on over there.
All right,

43
00:02:00,671 --> 00:02:04,900
so speaking of New York,
you're from Roslyn Long Island.

44
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:09,960
I'm from syosset Long Island.
We're about 10 minutes away from each 

45
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:13,021
other on the long island expressway.
I find that a lot of interesting people 

46
00:02:14,411 --> 00:02:16,600
come out of long island had.
Have you found that?

47
00:02:16,601 --> 00:02:17,740
Is that the water?
What's going on?

48
00:02:17,770 --> 00:02:18,550
You know,
it's crazy.

49
00:02:18,551 --> 00:02:23,551
I was told I was actually just having 
this conversation the other day with a 

50
00:02:23,551 --> 00:02:24,040
friend of mine and I was saying in my 
town,

51
00:02:24,310 --> 00:02:29,310
if you took the year that I graduated my
senior year and went back for years and 

52
00:02:29,831 --> 00:02:33,280
forward four years,
so in that eight year gap or whatever it

53
00:02:33,281 --> 00:02:34,280
is from,
you know,

54
00:02:34,350 --> 00:02:37,930
of kids that went through my school.
We have A.

55
00:02:37,931 --> 00:02:41,890
I think we have to with three 
professional sports team owners.

56
00:02:42,190 --> 00:02:47,190
We have multiple billionaires.
I have five guys that I went to high 

57
00:02:47,190 --> 00:02:51,841
school is that are in jail.
We've had multiple suicides and Bernie 

58
00:02:51,841 --> 00:02:55,621
madoff was from my town.
So I look at my town and think that 

59
00:02:55,621 --> 00:02:57,940
everybody had the same opportunity.
Same teachers.

60
00:02:57,941 --> 00:03:00,670
We had one movie.
I mean it was a small,

61
00:03:00,671 --> 00:03:02,100
relatively small town.
One,

62
00:03:02,180 --> 00:03:04,390
one real high,
one high school that everyone went to.

63
00:03:04,870 --> 00:03:08,860
A real sense of community.
Everyone had the same basically,

64
00:03:08,890 --> 00:03:13,890
you know,
journey through with as far as teachers 

65
00:03:13,890 --> 00:03:16,351
and everything.
Yet we had this crazy swing of the 

66
00:03:16,351 --> 00:03:19,270
biggest Ponzi schemer and his,
his family and sons were in our school,

67
00:03:19,630 --> 00:03:21,820
you know,
guys that were super successful.

68
00:03:22,030 --> 00:03:24,880
People that had super successful parents
that went to jail,

69
00:03:24,881 --> 00:03:26,770
I mean,
all in this community.

70
00:03:26,771 --> 00:03:27,970
And it was like,
Whoa,

71
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:32,230
what was in the water in this town?
What do you make of that actually,

72
00:03:32,260 --> 00:03:34,150
because there's gotta be something 
there.

73
00:03:34,151 --> 00:03:35,530
I mean,
even my high school,

74
00:03:35,531 --> 00:03:40,531
I mean there,
I knew a couple people that I went to 

75
00:03:40,531 --> 00:03:41,370
high school with that ended up in jail,
but we also had judd apatow into my high

76
00:03:41,371 --> 00:03:42,460
school.
Idina Menzel.

77
00:03:42,461 --> 00:03:44,590
Huge Broadway star.
Natalie Portman.

78
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:49,700
Yeah.
Until my high school and all sorts of 

79
00:03:49,700 --> 00:03:51,961
things.
I think that I feel very lucky that I 

80
00:03:51,961 --> 00:03:53,970
grew up in a town that I grew up in and 
the area that we grew up in that,

81
00:03:53,990 --> 00:03:54,760
um,
you know,

82
00:03:54,761 --> 00:03:56,440
it was,
it was diverse.

83
00:03:56,470 --> 00:03:58,600
There was a lot of opportunity,
there was creativity.

84
00:03:58,601 --> 00:04:03,601
It wasn't far from the city.
So we had like a little bit of the city 

85
00:04:03,601 --> 00:04:03,601
vibe.
Is that what it is?

86
00:04:03,601 --> 00:04:08,551
I think it has something to do with the 
proximity because we were about 45 

87
00:04:08,551 --> 00:04:09,850
minutes away from New York City.
Most of our parents,

88
00:04:09,851 --> 00:04:12,250
I'm guessing maybe your parents who 
worked in New York City,

89
00:04:12,420 --> 00:04:14,230
so there was like a little bit of a 
commuter thing,

90
00:04:14,231 --> 00:04:16,630
but you weren't totally part of New 
York.

91
00:04:16,631 --> 00:04:19,120
Like something related to that.
I think that's part of it.

92
00:04:19,121 --> 00:04:22,420
I think for me,
I think it's just the time period that I

93
00:04:22,421 --> 00:04:23,070
grew up,
you know,

94
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:28,200
as a kid and there was just a change in 
music change in culture and we would 

95
00:04:30,041 --> 00:04:35,041
just expose being close to the city.
We had early exposure to all those 

96
00:04:35,041 --> 00:04:38,230
trends and we were early to the party 
and I think that had a big impact,

97
00:04:38,260 --> 00:04:39,340
at least it did for me.

98
00:04:39,340 --> 00:04:41,380
I know as an entrepreneur and in my 
journey,

99
00:04:41,740 --> 00:04:44,080
it was exciting.
There was always exciting.

100
00:04:44,090 --> 00:04:46,540
I wanted to be part of everything.
So you know,

101
00:04:46,541 --> 00:04:51,541
I got addicted to newness because there 
was always something new going on and 

102
00:04:51,670 --> 00:04:55,150
that fueled me even going forward.
So I feel very lucky that,

103
00:04:55,151 --> 00:04:56,320
you know,
we grew up where we did.

104
00:04:56,680 --> 00:05:00,700
Anything else I should know about your 
formative years are family before we get

105
00:05:00,701 --> 00:05:02,790
into some of the things that you,
uh,

106
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:03,890
not.
No,

107
00:05:04,530 --> 00:05:06,580
you can ask me.
All right,

108
00:05:06,610 --> 00:05:11,610
well if there's,
if there's nothing else specific you 

109
00:05:11,610 --> 00:05:13,060
said addicted to newness.
So I feel this is the right time to play

110
00:05:13,061 --> 00:05:16,450
a little clip from you as a rapper known
as Jesse James.

111
00:05:16,510 --> 00:05:17,020
Lovely.

112
00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:29,700
Sounds like a good one.
Let me get my keys.

113
00:05:38,450 --> 00:05:43,450
She said how was the pain of saying 
don't even try it.

114
00:05:46,780 --> 00:05:47,650
I pulled through.
I love it,

115
00:05:47,780 --> 00:05:48,490
but Nah,
she didn't.

116
00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:55,700
She was laid off.
Wow.

117
00:06:03,770 --> 00:06:06,050
Oh Man.
Jesse James.

118
00:06:06,350 --> 00:06:11,350
That wasn't in the uh,
in the email that you sent me about the 

119
00:06:11,350 --> 00:06:11,350
shelf there.
You're going to flash back.

120
00:06:11,350 --> 00:06:13,260
We have a pretty crack research team 
around here.

121
00:06:13,490 --> 00:06:17,990
We're going full flashback before we get
to the future and the present.

122
00:06:19,340 --> 00:06:21,560
How did that happen?
Like I said,

123
00:06:21,561 --> 00:06:24,120
grew up in long island in the eighties,
you know,

124
00:06:24,140 --> 00:06:29,000
and hip hop was comment was emerging.
I got really into it at an early age and

125
00:06:29,001 --> 00:06:31,190
then when I was in college,
you know,

126
00:06:31,250 --> 00:06:36,250
I went,
everybody was writing their resumes and 

127
00:06:36,250 --> 00:06:36,250
sending out resumes.
I was like,

128
00:06:36,250 --> 00:06:36,280
I'm going to try to make a record,
like,

129
00:06:36,410 --> 00:06:38,920
this is what I want to do.
And um,

130
00:06:39,290 --> 00:06:42,200
there was no b plan and ultimately,
you know,

131
00:06:42,201 --> 00:06:47,201
that passion really for three years of 
college I was working towards trying to 

132
00:06:47,201 --> 00:06:52,091
get a record deal and ultimately landed 
a deal with a company called delicious 

133
00:06:52,091 --> 00:06:54,080
vinyl out in Cali,
not far from where we are.

134
00:06:54,350 --> 00:06:59,350
And they had two big accidents and they 
had a guy named tone loke wild thing 

135
00:06:59,350 --> 00:07:03,480
called Medina.
And then they had had a little bit of a 

136
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:03,770
tone loke feel to it that same 
producers.

137
00:07:04,100 --> 00:07:07,280
And then we had a young Mc who won a 
grammy for bust a move.

138
00:07:07,850 --> 00:07:09,210
So I was able to,
uh,

139
00:07:09,890 --> 00:07:10,970
I,
I didn't know that,

140
00:07:10,971 --> 00:07:13,940
but literally I was watching it this 
morning and I said to David,

141
00:07:13,941 --> 00:07:16,100
my producer that it's,
that's what it sounded like.

142
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:17,540
Yeah,
it's the same guys,

143
00:07:17,660 --> 00:07:20,050
same year,
same time and uh,

144
00:07:20,070 --> 00:07:21,770
and put an album out in the early 
nineties.

145
00:07:21,980 --> 00:07:26,980
Wow.
So I was watching it and I was thinking 

146
00:07:26,980 --> 00:07:26,980
man,
time changes,

147
00:07:26,980 --> 00:07:27,950
you know,
things change,

148
00:07:27,951 --> 00:07:31,060
we get sensitive to different things,
but I would guarantee it.

149
00:07:31,061 --> 00:07:35,450
But if a young guy like you put that 
song out now talking about a white woman

150
00:07:35,451 --> 00:07:40,451
in a white rapper,
we'd have a certain amount of people 

151
00:07:40,451 --> 00:07:40,790
screaming about cultural appropriation 
and all sorts of other stuff.

152
00:07:40,790 --> 00:07:43,490
Was that even remotely something back 
then?

153
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:44,000
Well,
you know,

154
00:07:44,001 --> 00:07:45,440
I think it was,
it wasn't on my mind,

155
00:07:45,441 --> 00:07:50,441
but the shaker,
like a white girl was my first single 

156
00:07:50,441 --> 00:07:53,320
was actually a remake,
the title of an old EU song or an old 

157
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:58,061
Bogos song from abandoned Washington dc 
that was predominantly all black.

158
00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:03,880
So I felt like I was just kind of taking
the momentum of this hit song and 

159
00:08:05,151 --> 00:08:07,550
introducing it to the theme to.
It was fun.

160
00:08:07,551 --> 00:08:09,100
I was in college,
I was,

161
00:08:09,230 --> 00:08:11,310
I wrote the whole album basically,
you know,

162
00:08:11,690 --> 00:08:15,560
as a fraternity in my fraternity house.
And um,

163
00:08:15,950 --> 00:08:17,240
yeah,
it was pretty tongue and cheek.

164
00:08:17,350 --> 00:08:22,350
Yeah,
it kind of makes you wish that things 

165
00:08:22,350 --> 00:08:23,090
were as simple as they were back then.
Right?

166
00:08:23,091 --> 00:08:23,930
Because you could,
could you,

167
00:08:24,050 --> 00:08:26,780
are you following me on this?
Like I can just see like some fraternity

168
00:08:26,781 --> 00:08:31,460
kid doing something silly like that now 
and just like getting just like a ton of

169
00:08:31,461 --> 00:08:32,120
shit for it.

170
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:34,520
Even if it was totally good natured and 
all that,

171
00:08:34,550 --> 00:08:37,580
it was totally good natured.
But I look back on it now and I think,

172
00:08:37,610 --> 00:08:42,610
you know,
if I were to go back in time I probably 

173
00:08:42,610 --> 00:08:45,790
would do a lot of things differently 
just based on what I know now and you 

174
00:08:45,790 --> 00:08:48,740
know,
I'm turning 50 so I'm very aware of,

175
00:08:48,860 --> 00:08:51,140
you know,
what chapter I am in my life,

176
00:08:51,141 --> 00:08:55,550
but when I looked back at me at 21 and 
what I knew then and you know,

177
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:57,600
all of the mistakes,
I made a 21.

178
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:58,530
Uh,
but you know,

179
00:08:58,531 --> 00:09:00,780
it's part of the growth and part of the 
journey.

180
00:09:01,060 --> 00:09:01,830
Yeah.
Alright.

181
00:09:01,870 --> 00:09:03,550
So I want to get to some of the growth 
and the journey.

182
00:09:03,551 --> 00:09:05,200
I want to get to cook and all that 
stuff.

183
00:09:05,201 --> 00:09:06,690
But wait,
let's just jump back to the,

184
00:09:06,750 --> 00:09:08,080
to the go New York,
go New York,

185
00:09:08,081 --> 00:09:13,081
go.
How in the world did that even appear 

186
00:09:13,081 --> 00:09:16,620
that you are going to be the guy that 
wrote that thing and were you shocked 

187
00:09:16,620 --> 00:09:16,620
that it caught on?
I mean,

188
00:09:16,620 --> 00:09:19,030
the video which we'll uh,
we'll also link to down below.

189
00:09:19,031 --> 00:09:21,670
I like,
I remember every moment of that.

190
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:24,200
So what happened for me is right after 
college,

191
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:25,440
no resume,
you know,

192
00:09:25,490 --> 00:09:29,510
got rejected by a lot of record labels.
I had no context.

193
00:09:29,511 --> 00:09:34,150
My Dad owned a plumbing supply house in 
Mineola also now we had,

194
00:09:34,330 --> 00:09:36,380
I didn't know anyone that was connected 
to anything,

195
00:09:36,381 --> 00:09:41,381
so I had to take this whole,
this whole process on my own shoulders 

196
00:09:41,381 --> 00:09:44,600
and I would literally take a greyhound 
bus on Friday from Washington dc where I

197
00:09:44,601 --> 00:09:49,250
went to school with my demo tape,
which was a recording of an instrumental

198
00:09:49,251 --> 00:09:53,510
that I played on my cd player and I 
would hit record on my answering machine

199
00:09:53,780 --> 00:09:56,420
and leave a wrap to the music while it 
was playing.

200
00:09:56,421 --> 00:09:57,820
That was out.
The only way I can man.

201
00:09:58,070 --> 00:09:58,820
Unbelievable.
Like,

202
00:09:58,830 --> 00:10:03,830
that just sounds like a time warp.
I know that was the only way I could do 

203
00:10:03,830 --> 00:10:07,541
it.
I would show up and handout that 

204
00:10:07,541 --> 00:10:07,541
cassette to everybody and got rejected.

205
00:10:07,541 --> 00:10:09,680
But ultimately I did get a record.
I get it.

206
00:10:09,740 --> 00:10:14,740
I didn't get a record deal and um,
but that was my only goal.

207
00:10:14,810 --> 00:10:19,810
So I took my foot off the gas pedal once
I got the deal and I didn't get signed 

208
00:10:19,810 --> 00:10:23,141
for a second album,
which to me was crushing at the time 

209
00:10:23,141 --> 00:10:25,250
because the only thing on my resume now 
was failed rapper,

210
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:30,600
you know,
I was also a Kiddie pool attendant 

211
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:32,861
before there.
So that wasn't really going to get me a 

212
00:10:32,861 --> 00:10:32,861
job on Wall Street.
That's like a low level.

213
00:10:32,861 --> 00:10:33,750
Like whoa.
Like training,

214
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:36,900
know no walk,
no peeing.

215
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:39,590
That was,
if you could say walk and stop,

216
00:10:39,620 --> 00:10:41,060
stop peeing.
You can get the job.

217
00:10:41,090 --> 00:10:46,090
They're always paying no matter.
There's nothing you to get them out of 

218
00:10:46,090 --> 00:10:46,460
that.
But in any event,

219
00:10:46,970 --> 00:10:48,920
I wanted to stay,
even though I didn't get picked up for a

220
00:10:48,921 --> 00:10:51,500
second album,
I wanted to marry my two passions,

221
00:10:51,501 --> 00:10:52,670
which was sports and music.

222
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,790
And I had this idea to write a theme 
song for the Knicks.

223
00:10:55,791 --> 00:10:57,680
I was like,
all of a sudden sports,

224
00:10:57,681 --> 00:11:02,681
we're changing.
The game is only 48 minutes and you're 

225
00:11:02,681 --> 00:11:03,890
there,
you're a fan for 48 minutes,

226
00:11:03,891 --> 00:11:06,700
but for the other two hours that you're 
in the arena during timeouts,

227
00:11:06,830 --> 00:11:11,830
you're an audience.
And the teams had to entertain the 

228
00:11:11,830 --> 00:11:11,840
audience.
And now they brought in the dancers.

229
00:11:11,841 --> 00:11:16,841
The dancers came in and they had video 
boards that all of a sudden never 

230
00:11:16,841 --> 00:11:16,850
existed.
So I was like,

231
00:11:16,940 --> 00:11:20,120
let's do a theme song.
Like the bears did a song in 86,

232
00:11:21,010 --> 00:11:23,600
let's do a theme song,
will get all the celebrities involved in

233
00:11:23,620 --> 00:11:28,620
and maybe you'll catch on.
So I wrote this demo basically in my 

234
00:11:28,940 --> 00:11:33,940
apartment,
which was like a dorm room and I played 

235
00:11:33,940 --> 00:11:33,940
it for the next.
And,

236
00:11:33,940 --> 00:11:35,890
uh,
had you even get that meeting I had,

237
00:11:35,970 --> 00:11:37,250
I started doing jingles.

238
00:11:37,340 --> 00:11:42,340
Uh,
and somehow I did a jingle for Nancy 

239
00:11:42,340 --> 00:11:47,140
Grunfeld clothing company or husband 
Ernie was the GM and she loved the 

240
00:11:47,140 --> 00:11:47,630
jingle and I said,
well,

241
00:11:47,631 --> 00:11:48,560
Nancy,
if you love this,

242
00:11:48,620 --> 00:11:51,050
let's,
let's do something for the next,

243
00:11:51,051 --> 00:11:52,220
let's try this.
So she said,

244
00:11:52,221 --> 00:11:54,880
I'll take a shot at.
So I just did it on Spec.

245
00:11:54,970 --> 00:11:59,920
I walked in and I knew there was 
something there and I played it for them

246
00:12:00,070 --> 00:12:01,420
and they said,
you know,

247
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:04,330
we'll,
we'll give you a $40,000

248
00:12:04,331 --> 00:12:06,250
for the song.
And I said,

249
00:12:06,310 --> 00:12:11,310
okay.
And I hired a right then and there you 

250
00:12:11,310 --> 00:12:11,310
said okay,
right then and there.

251
00:12:11,310 --> 00:12:11,310
Oh yeah,
no lawyer,

252
00:12:11,310 --> 00:12:14,250
no,
I didn't ask any questions of $40,000.

253
00:12:14,380 --> 00:12:17,170
It was eight months of rent.
So I,

254
00:12:17,350 --> 00:12:19,930
um,
when I hired a lawyer,

255
00:12:19,931 --> 00:12:22,450
ultimately I needed a lawyer,
studio engineer,

256
00:12:22,510 --> 00:12:23,530
Singer,
drummer,

257
00:12:23,531 --> 00:12:24,610
producer,
et cetera.

258
00:12:24,611 --> 00:12:26,680
It costs me $4,800
to do this song.

259
00:12:27,460 --> 00:12:31,060
But every team that came into Madison 
Square Garden and said,

260
00:12:31,510 --> 00:12:36,510
why don't we have a theme so this and 
the next got hot and it became the 

261
00:12:36,510 --> 00:12:38,800
number one most requested song.
That little jingle on New York radio.

262
00:12:39,190 --> 00:12:41,470
And I realized like that's the white 
space,

263
00:12:41,830 --> 00:12:46,830
nobody else is.
Everyone's trying to get on MTV and get 

264
00:12:46,830 --> 00:12:46,930
their records and tower records.
But no,

265
00:12:47,170 --> 00:12:52,170
there's a category,
a new category that I could create 

266
00:12:52,170 --> 00:12:52,170
sports,
music,

267
00:12:52,170 --> 00:12:53,680
and I started doing theme songs for 
professional sports teams.

268
00:12:54,220 --> 00:12:59,220
It's so awesome.
Like it's just such a great story of 

269
00:12:59,220 --> 00:13:00,210
just like a kid,
basically a kid just like it over there,

270
00:13:00,230 --> 00:13:03,220
just get out there and do something.
It's kind of,

271
00:13:03,230 --> 00:13:05,440
it's kind of a beautiful thing.
You must look at it back.

272
00:13:05,441 --> 00:13:10,441
I can see sort of in your face,
like there's like a nostalgia to it 

273
00:13:10,441 --> 00:13:10,441
because it was just like,
it was what it was.

274
00:13:10,441 --> 00:13:15,180
I look at it from that chapter of my 
life where I had 21 years old I had,

275
00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:19,120
there were no consequences.
Like if I didn't get this song,

276
00:13:19,121 --> 00:13:20,740
I would have gone to the next team and 
kept.

277
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:25,920
I was so deeply connected to my dream,
like emotionally connected to the goal 

278
00:13:27,310 --> 00:13:30,820
that I was on greyhound bus every day 
dry.

279
00:13:30,850 --> 00:13:35,850
I mean I would do anything.
So just to have the opportunity that it 

280
00:13:35,850 --> 00:13:37,050
was just everything else was gravy.
Yeah.

281
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:42,160
So,
so is that really where the 

282
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:43,711
entrepreneurial spirit started with you 
because it seems like you've got that 

283
00:13:43,711 --> 00:13:47,701
going and then that opened up a whole 
slew of other doors that opened up the 

284
00:13:47,701 --> 00:13:51,031
floodgates for some big,
for some big future successes and 

285
00:13:51,031 --> 00:13:55,081
failures.
But I was thinking about this actually 

286
00:13:55,081 --> 00:13:55,081
yesterday on a run.
You know,

287
00:13:55,081 --> 00:13:55,720
I used to.
You'll probably remember,

288
00:13:55,721 --> 00:14:00,010
I don't know if you're into tennis,
but the US Open was right by,

289
00:14:00,070 --> 00:14:00,520
you know,
you can take.

290
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:01,180
Oh yeah,
flushing,

291
00:14:01,181 --> 00:14:03,010
yes.
We would just take the train.

292
00:14:03,940 --> 00:14:04,870
There were no rules.
My,

293
00:14:04,940 --> 00:14:06,970
my parent's home by 8:00
at night,

294
00:14:07,390 --> 00:14:12,390
I would take the train and I remember I 
would never have a ticket and all I 

295
00:14:12,390 --> 00:14:17,131
could look,
I would look forward to being able to 

296
00:14:17,131 --> 00:14:17,131
try to sneak into the US Open and I 
remember that,

297
00:14:17,170 --> 00:14:21,010
that I've kind of figured out how to 
sneak into the u s open regularly.

298
00:14:21,310 --> 00:14:24,700
So I would go no ticket,
everyone's online and I would go to like

299
00:14:24,850 --> 00:14:28,990
how I went in and then I would walk out 
and see if I could do it again somewhere

300
00:14:28,991 --> 00:14:32,590
else.
And that was really the start of like,

301
00:14:32,650 --> 00:14:34,270
as I look back,
like I just want,

302
00:14:34,390 --> 00:14:37,270
I like challenges.
It doesn't,

303
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:41,330
it's not about anything other than can I
figure it out and,

304
00:14:41,420 --> 00:14:46,330
and it started for me at an early age 
and ultimately it gravitate,

305
00:14:46,331 --> 00:14:51,331
you know,
it started to gravitate towards 

306
00:14:51,331 --> 00:14:51,331
business.

307
00:14:51,331 --> 00:14:51,331
So let's,
let's get there.

308
00:14:51,331 --> 00:14:51,331
So,
okay,

309
00:14:51,331 --> 00:14:53,120
you're making the jingles,
some things happen.

310
00:14:53,121 --> 00:14:58,121
You're obviously making money,
probably some serious money for the 

311
00:14:58,121 --> 00:15:00,491
first time.
How does this get you to starting 

312
00:15:00,491 --> 00:15:03,161
incubators and starting these companies.
So every team that came into Madison 

313
00:15:03,820 --> 00:15:08,820
Square Garden say,
why don't we have a song like this who 

314
00:15:08,820 --> 00:15:08,820
did this?
And I was the guy.

315
00:15:08,820 --> 00:15:12,700
So I started writing all these 10 songs 
and ultimately sold that company to a 

316
00:15:14,271 --> 00:15:19,271
public company called SFX.
And the owner of SFX had a timeshare in 

317
00:15:19,271 --> 00:15:22,360
a private jet.
And he invited was like 26 years old and

318
00:15:22,610 --> 00:15:26,660
he invited my partner and I as guests 
onto his private jet and it was like the

319
00:15:26,661 --> 00:15:28,610
scene in the wizard of Oz when we walked
on the plane,

320
00:15:28,611 --> 00:15:29,780
when everything goes from black and 
white,

321
00:15:30,350 --> 00:15:31,820
I walked on the plane,
I'm like,

322
00:15:32,810 --> 00:15:36,220
people fly like this,
and by the time we landed,

323
00:15:36,290 --> 00:15:37,520
my partner turned to me,
he's like,

324
00:15:37,730 --> 00:15:41,720
we got to start a private jet company so
we can fly around on these planes.

325
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:43,130
And I was like,
let's do it.

326
00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:46,370
That's all there is.
And that's literally how we started this

327
00:15:46,371 --> 00:15:50,420
company that ultimately be called.
I was called Marquis jet that,

328
00:15:50,421 --> 00:15:55,421
um,
became the largest private jet car 

329
00:15:55,421 --> 00:15:55,520
company in the world.
So you eventually sold the company.

330
00:15:55,521 --> 00:15:56,480
It's called nest yet?
No,

331
00:15:56,510 --> 00:16:01,510
it was called Marquis jet.
And you sold it to Warren Buffett's 

332
00:16:01,510 --> 00:16:02,750
Netjet,
which is a Berkshire hathaway company.

333
00:16:03,630 --> 00:16:05,930
And then.
So then now you're rolling in bill.

334
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:07,430
Um,
it was,

335
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:12,520
it was a change,
definitely a life changing moment for 

336
00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:12,520
me.
Um,

337
00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:17,290
but again,
I love newness and I was a at that time 

338
00:16:17,541 --> 00:16:22,340
in my life I had just ran 100 mile run 
for charity and I gave myself 90 days to

339
00:16:22,341 --> 00:16:26,150
train for it and during the process of,
of my training,

340
00:16:26,540 --> 00:16:31,540
I discovered coconut water because I did
a lot of research around hydration and 

341
00:16:31,540 --> 00:16:31,540
nutrition.

342
00:16:31,540 --> 00:16:34,310
If you're going to run 24,
100 miles nonstop,

343
00:16:35,090 --> 00:16:40,090
what do you,
what do you drink and how many calories 

344
00:16:40,090 --> 00:16:41,960
you take in and you're experimenting 
with that with that now through your new

345
00:16:41,961 --> 00:16:45,650
diet which you're going through.
But I discovered coconut water and which

346
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:49,400
ultimately fueled me for this race that 
I completed.

347
00:16:49,401 --> 00:16:50,390
And when I was done I was like,
man,

348
00:16:50,391 --> 00:16:55,391
this is the fountain of Youth.
This is going to be the next big thing 

349
00:16:55,391 --> 00:16:55,391
in beverage,
you know,

350
00:16:55,391 --> 00:16:56,000
it's like,
this is the next orange juice,

351
00:16:56,060 --> 00:16:57,770
this is the next poem.
Wonderful.

352
00:16:58,130 --> 00:17:03,130
And I spent a year traveling the globe 
trying to figure out how to import 

353
00:17:03,130 --> 00:17:03,130
coconut water.
Where,

354
00:17:03,130 --> 00:17:05,600
where yours is.
This is a 2007,

355
00:17:06,080 --> 00:17:11,080
2007.
So like was money because it's not that 

356
00:17:11,080 --> 00:17:11,080
long ago.
And yet,

357
00:17:11,080 --> 00:17:14,381
coconut orders so massive right now 
you'd think this would have to be 25 

358
00:17:14,381 --> 00:17:14,810
years ago,
but in 2007,

359
00:17:14,811 --> 00:17:15,500
it wasn't even on the show.

360
00:17:15,530 --> 00:17:17,960
There was one skew on the shelf,
wasn't,

361
00:17:18,060 --> 00:17:19,190
it?
Didn't really exist.

362
00:17:19,770 --> 00:17:21,470
Uh,
but I realized that the learning curve,

363
00:17:21,471 --> 00:17:24,830
I got like a 90 on my sat.
The learning curve was 1200.

364
00:17:24,831 --> 00:17:25,490
Okay.
All right.

365
00:17:25,940 --> 00:17:27,380
I'm old ones.
I should have called you.

366
00:17:28,220 --> 00:17:29,480
I couldn't figure it out,
man.

367
00:17:29,481 --> 00:17:31,010
I'm like,
I know I can market this,

368
00:17:31,011 --> 00:17:34,490
but like I don't know how I'm going to 
import this and so many moving pieces.

369
00:17:34,850 --> 00:17:37,210
So I ended up partnering with a company 
that was a,

370
00:17:37,550 --> 00:17:42,550
you know,
on the scene called Zico just doing a 

371
00:17:42,550 --> 00:17:45,161
couple million dollars in sales.
And then ultimately two years later we 

372
00:17:45,161 --> 00:17:46,100
sold it to cook.
So then,

373
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:47,780
then you're really in the business 
world.

374
00:17:47,781 --> 00:17:50,310
Like at that point you've sold two 
companies and,

375
00:17:50,370 --> 00:17:52,650
and your role and how,
how do you then go,

376
00:17:52,651 --> 00:17:54,390
all right,
I like newness.

377
00:17:54,450 --> 00:17:59,450
What's new after this?
Because that's what your story seems to 

378
00:17:59,450 --> 00:17:59,450
be.

379
00:17:59,450 --> 00:18:00,900
It's just like another.
What's new,

380
00:18:00,901 --> 00:18:01,650
what's new,
what's new,

381
00:18:01,651 --> 00:18:04,110
what's new?
But I get bored easily and I just,

382
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:04,770
you know,
I,

383
00:18:04,780 --> 00:18:09,600
I believe in checking the box and like 
not celebrating what happened,

384
00:18:09,601 --> 00:18:11,460
happened,
what's next?

385
00:18:11,730 --> 00:18:13,050
And you know,
my whole thing,

386
00:18:13,051 --> 00:18:15,480
I always talk about this,
it's just about building my own personal

387
00:18:15,481 --> 00:18:17,820
life resume,
not even my business resume.

388
00:18:17,821 --> 00:18:22,821
And Like I love adventure.
So I was just looking for whatever that 

389
00:18:22,821 --> 00:18:27,410
next opportunity was and it became,
it was for me at the time,

390
00:18:27,411 --> 00:18:29,880
light of my life.
The next thing was a book,

391
00:18:30,300 --> 00:18:32,730
but it wasn't planned.
It wasn't planned.

392
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:37,760
Let's,
let's talk about that book a little bit 

393
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:37,760
before we get to this book.
Yeah.

394
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:37,760
I was at a,
uh,

395
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:39,870
at a race,
a 24 hour race.

396
00:18:39,900 --> 00:18:44,900
I love endurance.
I participate in a lot of endurance 

397
00:18:44,900 --> 00:18:45,060
events.
And um,

398
00:18:45,540 --> 00:18:47,250
the race was,
was a really,

399
00:18:47,370 --> 00:18:48,240
really format.

400
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:53,240
So I was a five friends and each runs a 
mile and you rotate and whatever team 

401
00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:56,940
runs the most amount of miles in 24 
hours wins the competition.

402
00:18:57,480 --> 00:18:59,610
But at the start of the race,
there was a guy sitting next to us,

403
00:18:59,611 --> 00:19:01,680
had no one to really with.
He had no teammates.

404
00:19:01,740 --> 00:19:05,490
He was his own team and he weighed like 
285 pounds,

405
00:19:05,670 --> 00:19:08,280
big African American guy just sitting in
a chair.

406
00:19:08,750 --> 00:19:13,750
Everything to myself.
How in the world is a guy that weighs 

407
00:19:13,750 --> 00:19:16,980
two 85 going to run for 24 straight 
hours and the race was uncertain?

408
00:19:17,010 --> 00:19:19,800
Are you even allowed to.
They let you run a relay.

409
00:19:19,801 --> 00:19:21,960
One guy,
it was like the always so low,

410
00:19:21,961 --> 00:19:24,200
you know,
by himself and it was just like.

411
00:19:24,210 --> 00:19:28,340
And it was just so big and eating and 
the race was unsupported so they,

412
00:19:28,380 --> 00:19:31,140
they provide nothing.
It was on a dirt one mile,

413
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:32,370
unlit parking lot.

414
00:19:32,370 --> 00:19:34,260
And you hadn't even bring their own 
water.

415
00:19:34,261 --> 00:19:37,680
I mean they gave you nothing.
So I had just sold my company.

416
00:19:37,681 --> 00:19:39,420
I like,
I went crazy on our side.

417
00:19:39,460 --> 00:19:44,190
The seuss is a table set up like 10.
This guy had three items,

418
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:48,000
a box of crackers,
a fold up chair and a bottle of water.

419
00:19:48,330 --> 00:19:49,320
And I was like,
man,

420
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:51,600
this isn't going to work out well.
And sure enough,

421
00:19:51,601 --> 00:19:53,610
at mile 70,
he,

422
00:19:53,611 --> 00:19:58,611
because of his weight,
he had broken multiple bones in both of 

423
00:19:58,611 --> 00:20:02,331
his feet.
He crushed the bones in his feet and 

424
00:20:02,331 --> 00:20:02,700
he's from just the pounding because he 
was just so big and because the only had

425
00:20:02,701 --> 00:20:05,160
water and crackers,
he had kidney failure.

426
00:20:05,250 --> 00:20:09,030
He was peeing blood down his leg and my 
first reaction is,

427
00:20:09,031 --> 00:20:14,031
man,
we gotta get this guy a medic 

428
00:20:14,031 --> 00:20:14,580
immediately like airlift and add here to
a hospital.

429
00:20:15,660 --> 00:20:16,410
Boy Did he do.

430
00:20:17,220 --> 00:20:19,740
He gets out of the chair,
picks himself up,

431
00:20:20,040 --> 00:20:25,040
runs another 30 miles to get to his goal
of 100 and then runs one more in case 

432
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:27,360
they miscounted and I immediately was 
like,

433
00:20:27,361 --> 00:20:29,510
man,
I gotta I gotTa meet this guy.

434
00:20:29,730 --> 00:20:33,660
I got to meet him because whatever 
secret sauce he has,

435
00:20:33,670 --> 00:20:36,150
like whatever drive he has to get them 
out,

436
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:41,360
get them out of the chair.
You don't even get a ribbon for funding 

437
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:41,430
like pat you on the back.
Good job.

438
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:44,100
There's no trophy.
You don't get extra crackers.

439
00:20:44,130 --> 00:20:46,950
No.
This was like go home and that's that.

440
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:51,250
Whatever got them out of the chair.
If I could teach that to my kids,

441
00:20:52,150 --> 00:20:56,170
if I could apply that drive to the 
multiple buckets of my life,

442
00:20:56,710 --> 00:20:59,530
then all the areas of my life would be 
so much better.

443
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:01,150
So I ended up call,
you know,

444
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:02,220
googling.
I'm founding.

445
00:21:02,230 --> 00:21:07,230
It was a navy seal.
I cold called them and we sat down for 

446
00:21:07,230 --> 00:21:10,801
lunch and I realized I would never get 
the secret sauce in a lunch meeting and 

447
00:21:10,801 --> 00:21:11,800
just ask them like,
would you come live with me for a month?

448
00:21:12,460 --> 00:21:17,460
And he said to me,
I'm basically direct quote,

449
00:21:17,591 --> 00:21:20,830
if you're crazy enough to ask a guy like
me to come live with you,

450
00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:22,840
mother Fucker,
I'm crazy enough to come.

451
00:21:23,470 --> 00:21:28,470
And that was the start of our journey.
So you've spent how much time you spent 

452
00:21:28,470 --> 00:21:32,490
a month?
He came and moved into with my wife 

453
00:21:32,490 --> 00:21:32,490
Sarah,
myself,

454
00:21:32,490 --> 00:21:36,541
and at the time my son had one child.
We should mention his name because let's

455
00:21:36,581 --> 00:21:38,350
give him the credit.
David Goggins,

456
00:21:38,860 --> 00:21:41,230
David Goggins.
He's an amazing human,

457
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:43,000
uh,
an American.

458
00:21:43,150 --> 00:21:47,770
And I'm with an amazing story.
Came and lived with my wife and I and my

459
00:21:47,771 --> 00:21:49,720
son for $8 for 30 days.

460
00:21:49,730 --> 00:21:52,840
Or what did your wife think about this?
I'm bringing a navy seal and for a month

461
00:21:53,710 --> 00:21:55,930
she called me after the lunch meeting 
and she said,

462
00:21:55,931 --> 00:21:56,920
you know,
how did it go?

463
00:21:57,220 --> 00:22:00,160
And I said,
very quickly isn't live with us.

464
00:22:01,380 --> 00:22:05,290
She got into a big fuss.
I said,

465
00:22:05,291 --> 00:22:06,070
no,
he's sweet.

466
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:09,070
He's coming to live with us on Friday.
And um,

467
00:22:09,580 --> 00:22:10,990
no,
I mean she wants,

468
00:22:10,991 --> 00:22:15,991
he came in,
they immediately took to each other and 

469
00:22:15,991 --> 00:22:20,850
it was just an amazing journey.
And then I never thought the notion of 

470
00:22:20,850 --> 00:22:22,420
writing a book never crossed my mind.
In fact,

471
00:22:22,421 --> 00:22:27,421
the book came out,
the booklet living with the seal came 

472
00:22:27,421 --> 00:22:29,230
out five years after he actually lived 
with us.

473
00:22:29,630 --> 00:22:34,630
Um,
because as I started to put some of the 

474
00:22:34,630 --> 00:22:37,860
tools that I,
I learned what I learned about myself 

475
00:22:37,860 --> 00:22:40,900
and about his mindset into action and 
share it with others.

476
00:22:40,900 --> 00:22:41,350
I was like,
well,

477
00:22:41,351 --> 00:22:46,351
there's something here.
And that's sort of how it came to 

478
00:22:46,351 --> 00:22:46,351
fruition.
Yeah,

479
00:22:46,351 --> 00:22:47,710
let's explore some of that stuff.
So he gets to your house first day,

480
00:22:47,711 --> 00:22:52,711
like,
did you have a plan or were you just 

481
00:22:52,711 --> 00:22:52,711
like,
take over man,

482
00:22:52,711 --> 00:22:52,711
you got a month?
Like,

483
00:22:52,711 --> 00:22:53,470
make me better.
I said to,

484
00:22:53,471 --> 00:22:55,480
uh,
make yourself at home is the first thing

485
00:22:55,481 --> 00:22:56,590
I said to him and I said,
you know,

486
00:22:56,650 --> 00:23:01,650
our home is your home.
And he walked right over to me and he 

487
00:23:01,650 --> 00:23:02,710
said,
I don't have a home as you know,

488
00:23:03,040 --> 00:23:04,930
make yourself at home.
It's just an expression.

489
00:23:05,470 --> 00:23:06,850
And again,
it got a little closer,

490
00:23:06,851 --> 00:23:08,200
like nose to nose.
And he said,

491
00:23:08,620 --> 00:23:13,620
I don't operate in expressions as like a
great little,

492
00:23:13,721 --> 00:23:15,900
great 30 day house guest.
And he said,

493
00:23:15,901 --> 00:23:17,080
in fact,
get your stuff on.

494
00:23:17,081 --> 00:23:22,081
Let's go see where you're at.
Physically will go down to the gym so I 

495
00:23:22,081 --> 00:23:22,081
can map out the month.

496
00:23:22,081 --> 00:23:24,010
And when he came to live with us at that
time in my life,

497
00:23:24,011 --> 00:23:25,300
I was in a great spot.
You know,

498
00:23:25,301 --> 00:23:26,770
I was married,
I'm still married,

499
00:23:27,140 --> 00:23:32,140
um,
had just had a child and now for had 

500
00:23:32,140 --> 00:23:33,580
some failure,
had some success.

501
00:23:33,581 --> 00:23:35,470
But I was in,
I thought I was in a really good spot.

502
00:23:35,471 --> 00:23:39,270
But like so many of us,
I was in a routine now,

503
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:41,800
it was really comfortable in my routine.
My routine was get up,

504
00:23:41,801 --> 00:23:44,290
work out hard,
go to work all day,

505
00:23:44,410 --> 00:23:46,910
come home,
have some dinner with my wife and child,

506
00:23:47,060 --> 00:23:52,060
little bit of alone time repeat.
And like I thought I was operating up 

507
00:23:52,060 --> 00:23:55,340
here but I was so comfortable I couldn't
get out of it.

508
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:59,030
And like you routines are great but they
can also be a Rut.

509
00:23:59,570 --> 00:24:02,840
Like I realized like I don't want to go 
through life like this.

510
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:05,060
Like I want to go through life like 
this.

511
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:10,480
I got to get out of my routine man,
otherwise I'm going to wake up and I'll 

512
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:10,700
be 70.
So you think that that routine,

513
00:24:10,760 --> 00:24:15,760
even when it's all going well and it 
sounds like things were going pretty 

514
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:15,760
well for you,
that no matter what,

515
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:20,150
that level of routine will automatically
stifle creativity without question and,

516
00:24:20,210 --> 00:24:23,660
and time goes fast.
Like I have four kids,

517
00:24:23,661 --> 00:24:25,320
I want to slow the clock down.
Yeah.

518
00:24:25,550 --> 00:24:29,840
And if I'm in routine and your routine,
you miss a lot of opportunities,

519
00:24:29,841 --> 00:24:34,841
at least for me,
that's the way I've found my life to 

520
00:24:34,841 --> 00:24:37,301
unfold.
And I feel like when I stepped out of 

521
00:24:37,301 --> 00:24:37,301
routine,
you know,

522
00:24:37,301 --> 00:24:41,920
when I go into the unknown,
that's where amazing growth happens and 

523
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:46,421
that's where I feel most alive and 
that's where I get the most benefit and 

524
00:24:46,421 --> 00:24:48,080
that's why it's a check the box and move
on mentality.

525
00:24:48,410 --> 00:24:50,990
And that's what this opportunity was for
me.

526
00:24:51,020 --> 00:24:53,180
Nothing other than to,
you know,

527
00:24:53,210 --> 00:24:58,210
to step into the unknown.
He represented unknown and a and a 

528
00:24:58,311 --> 00:25:01,430
little bit of secret sauce.
So we'd go down to my gym and you know,

529
00:25:01,431 --> 00:25:02,870
he's like,
let me see how many posts you can do.

530
00:25:03,530 --> 00:25:04,970
So I got up and I,
you know,

531
00:25:05,150 --> 00:25:10,150
I can run pretty far in a circle or a 
straight line for a long time but not 

532
00:25:10,150 --> 00:25:11,620
really strong.
So I did like a,

533
00:25:12,100 --> 00:25:14,840
like eight pull ups,
which is an exaggeration,

534
00:25:15,940 --> 00:25:20,940
like for like two bullets.
And then he started wait 30 seconds and 

535
00:25:21,411 --> 00:25:26,411
do it again.
So I got back on the bar and I did 

536
00:25:26,411 --> 00:25:26,411
again,
like one or two or something,

537
00:25:26,411 --> 00:25:26,780
you know,
barely.

538
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:28,070
He said,
wait 30 seconds,

539
00:25:28,071 --> 00:25:31,580
I want you to do it again.
And now like my arms are like I get back

540
00:25:31,581 --> 00:25:34,400
on the bar and I'm trying to get my chin
up over the bar.

541
00:25:34,850 --> 00:25:37,550
And I dropped down and I started,
well what's next?

542
00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:42,880
And he said,
well what's next is we're not leaving 

543
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:42,890
here until you do 100 more Jesus.
And I said,

544
00:25:43,100 --> 00:25:45,410
that's impossible.
I can't do 100.

545
00:25:45,890 --> 00:25:47,330
And he said to me,
well,

546
00:25:47,331 --> 00:25:50,180
I already know what your biggest problem
is,

547
00:25:50,210 --> 00:25:52,160
but probably with all of our biggest 
problem is.

548
00:25:52,700 --> 00:25:57,700
And he said,
I'm the limitations that you're putting 

549
00:25:57,700 --> 00:26:00,821
on herself that we put on ourselves are 
self imposed and I'm going to prove it 

550
00:26:00,821 --> 00:26:05,081
to you.
So get back up on fucking bar and give 

551
00:26:05,081 --> 00:26:08,591
me a pull up.
So I did a pull up and I dropped down 

552
00:26:08,591 --> 00:26:10,310
and I repeated that process until I did 
all hundred holy.

553
00:26:10,520 --> 00:26:15,520
And I realized it took like two hours.
But I realized at that moment that if 

554
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:19,860
I'm under indexing by 100 pull ups,
like what are the areas of my life and 

555
00:26:20,331 --> 00:26:21,890
my under indexing it,
you know,

556
00:26:22,550 --> 00:26:26,000
am I under indexing at work with my wife
and my relationships?

557
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,100
Am I comfortable,
am I in this routine?

558
00:26:28,101 --> 00:26:33,101
I mean,
I just didn't want to go to that place 

559
00:26:33,101 --> 00:26:35,591
of pain to see what I was really made up
and that started our journey and that 

560
00:26:36,261 --> 00:26:39,770
was a constant theme of like,
how far can you take this,

561
00:26:39,771 --> 00:26:40,430
Jesse?
Like,

562
00:26:40,460 --> 00:26:42,560
you know,
why are you holding yourself back?

563
00:26:42,561 --> 00:26:45,750
And not physically but in,
in everything,

564
00:26:45,780 --> 00:26:46,830
in work.
Okay.

565
00:26:46,950 --> 00:26:51,180
You've had some success,
but how do you know your limits?

566
00:26:51,181 --> 00:26:55,350
It's like when I started running,
my goal was to run two miles.

567
00:26:56,310 --> 00:27:01,310
If I could run two miles in 18 minutes,
I consider myself a runner and that was 

568
00:27:01,310 --> 00:27:01,680
it.
And I worked hard to get.

569
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:05,340
Took me weeks to go from the couch to 
those two miles.

570
00:27:06,060 --> 00:27:07,800
There's a lot of people with a gun to 
their head.

571
00:27:07,801 --> 00:27:11,940
They can run two miles right now.
Nothing changed in my body since then.

572
00:27:11,970 --> 00:27:16,970
Same legs,
same long as God gave me saying I'm not 

573
00:27:16,970 --> 00:27:19,821
really strong,
but I was able to take that same body 

574
00:27:19,821 --> 00:27:23,151
guy gave me from two miles and 
ultimately take it to 100 miles without 

575
00:27:23,151 --> 00:27:27,660
stopping and the only thing that changed
was what I thought I could do.

576
00:27:28,210 --> 00:27:33,210
So if I was under indexing 50 x in that 
area again,

577
00:27:34,530 --> 00:27:39,530
what am I limits in business,
what am I limits in my life resume and 

578
00:27:39,530 --> 00:27:43,200
how I live my life and what am I limits 
and how deep my relationships can be and

579
00:27:43,201 --> 00:27:47,970
what am I limits in how much I can learn
and we're travel or anything.

580
00:27:48,930 --> 00:27:53,930
So I think it's probably easy for people
at some level to understand the 

581
00:27:53,930 --> 00:27:54,600
quantifiable stuff.
I can run faster,

582
00:27:54,601 --> 00:27:56,580
I can lift more,
that kind of stuff.

583
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:58,440
Could you talk about it sort of on the 
mental side,

584
00:27:58,450 --> 00:28:03,450
on the relationship side,
like how do you actually judge what are 

585
00:28:03,450 --> 00:28:05,070
the right ways to spread yourself in 
those areas?

586
00:28:05,070 --> 00:28:05,670
Sure.
Well,

587
00:28:05,671 --> 00:28:07,500
I mean I think that.
I think for me,

588
00:28:08,790 --> 00:28:11,190
I think a lot of people and we think 
about relationships.

589
00:28:11,220 --> 00:28:13,230
We think of relationships between 
people.

590
00:28:13,850 --> 00:28:18,060
How is your relationship with your 
parents or your child or your husband or

591
00:28:18,061 --> 00:28:23,061
wife or whatever it is,
and I think one thing that's often very 

592
00:28:23,061 --> 00:28:26,971
neglected is our relationship with time 
and talk about quantifiable stuff and 

593
00:28:28,890 --> 00:28:30,930
I'm very aware of my relationship with 
time.

594
00:28:30,931 --> 00:28:35,931
That's been a fundamental shift for me 
over the last couple of years and maybe 

595
00:28:35,931 --> 00:28:37,530
because I've turned 50,
but I was recently on a,

596
00:28:37,560 --> 00:28:39,510
on a camping trip.
You look like you're 28.

597
00:28:40,330 --> 00:28:42,460
He's doing something right.
We don't know man,

598
00:28:42,500 --> 00:28:43,650
it's,
it's long island,

599
00:28:45,090 --> 00:28:50,090
but I was recently on a camping trip and
I was with a friend of mine as a police 

600
00:28:50,090 --> 00:28:51,450
officer and stuff.
The Kennedy County.

601
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:56,480
He had his daughter.
I had my son and we went on a on a cold 

602
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:59,320
winter now,
Washington blizzardy outdoor,

603
00:28:59,321 --> 00:29:02,430
sleeping in the snow camping trip and I 
turned to him and I said,

604
00:29:02,431 --> 00:29:05,520
Cathy,
how often do you do trips like this?

605
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:08,280
This is a guy that's a police officer.
You know,

606
00:29:08,281 --> 00:29:11,400
one of the happiest guys I know,
probably not super well off.

607
00:29:11,401 --> 00:29:12,300
I mean,
you know,

608
00:29:12,630 --> 00:29:16,650
a blue collar guy,
extremely happy and he says,

609
00:29:16,651 --> 00:29:21,651
I take.
He said every year I take one trip a 

610
00:29:21,651 --> 00:29:22,500
year with my college friends.
I've been doing it for 21 years old.

611
00:29:23,010 --> 00:29:26,730
Then every other month I take a trip 
with my family or myself.

612
00:29:26,731 --> 00:29:28,590
It'd be running a marathon.
It could be go to the lake,

613
00:29:28,591 --> 00:29:29,940
it could be going on a hike,
whatever.

614
00:29:30,750 --> 00:29:32,730
And I said to myself,
if I can't take,

615
00:29:32,731 --> 00:29:37,731
I call it Kevin's rule,
one weekend every eight weeks for my own

616
00:29:38,731 --> 00:29:43,731
adventure with my family,
with friends and doesn't have to be 

617
00:29:43,731 --> 00:29:46,531
something that costs a lot of money.
But if I can think five or six of those 

618
00:29:46,531 --> 00:29:49,270
a year,
then I'm way out of balance.

619
00:29:49,480 --> 00:29:52,010
So it might not be a direct answer to 
your question,

620
00:29:52,011 --> 00:29:53,630
but what I'm saying is,
you know,

621
00:29:53,710 --> 00:29:58,710
you,
you could in the past maybe that would 

622
00:29:58,710 --> 00:29:59,890
be one or two times a year and I 
wouldn't even be aware of it.

623
00:30:00,670 --> 00:30:05,670
But once you become aware of it,
look over the next 30 years you're 

624
00:30:05,670 --> 00:30:06,930
talking about 150 memories.
You know,

625
00:30:07,020 --> 00:30:10,840
it's all cumulative as opposed to maybe 
20,

626
00:30:10,841 --> 00:30:15,841
30 memories.
That's the difference of like a really 

627
00:30:15,841 --> 00:30:19,530
full life.
It could be at the end of the day with 

628
00:30:19,530 --> 00:30:21,850
no regrets,
with no regrets versus someone that's in

629
00:30:21,851 --> 00:30:26,851
their routine going through life like 
this and then you wake up and you're 75 

630
00:30:26,961 --> 00:30:27,850
and you're like,
fuck,

631
00:30:28,660 --> 00:30:31,030
I don't have the energy to go to Mt.
Washington anymore.

632
00:30:31,031 --> 00:30:33,130
I don't have my son.
My kids are grown up,

633
00:30:34,030 --> 00:30:39,030
so those kinds of shifts are measurable 
and I can pinpoint in time,

634
00:30:39,220 --> 00:30:43,270
I can pinpoint into my relationship with
my wife and just Friday night dinners,

635
00:30:43,480 --> 00:30:44,560
Wednesday night,
date night.

636
00:30:45,310 --> 00:30:48,070
It's just,
what's your relationship with time?

637
00:30:48,071 --> 00:30:53,071
How do you spend it?
Who Do you spend it with and are you 

638
00:30:53,071 --> 00:30:53,071
doing the things you love to do?

639
00:30:53,071 --> 00:30:57,380
Yeah.
Well that's definitely a good segue to 

640
00:30:57,380 --> 00:30:59,190
living with monks so quickly though.
Do you have some of those people in your

641
00:30:59,191 --> 00:31:04,191
life where Kevin just said about 
reconnect with the high school friends 

642
00:31:04,191 --> 00:31:07,131
and that.
Because I find now a couple of my most 

643
00:31:07,131 --> 00:31:07,800
valuable relationships that I have right
now are with.

644
00:31:07,801 --> 00:31:09,920
One of them's my,
my childhood best friends since,

645
00:31:09,921 --> 00:31:11,490
um,
since we were four years old,

646
00:31:11,491 --> 00:31:14,510
I remember meeting the guy and in 
kindergarten and I think it,

647
00:31:14,511 --> 00:31:17,880
maybe it was the day before kindergarten
and then another friend from third grade

648
00:31:18,120 --> 00:31:23,120
and we've stayed connected and because 
of that it helps me frame the future 

649
00:31:23,130 --> 00:31:28,130
because we've been having these same 
conversations about love and life and 

650
00:31:28,130 --> 00:31:30,570
sports and politics forever.
And it's like watching us all,

651
00:31:30,600 --> 00:31:32,010
you know,
one of them lives in jersey,

652
00:31:32,011 --> 00:31:37,011
ones in,
in Texas and I'm here in La and yet our 

653
00:31:37,011 --> 00:31:38,010
journeys,
they still matter to each other.

654
00:31:38,011 --> 00:31:40,330
So I think it helps set the future sort 
of.

655
00:31:40,380 --> 00:31:42,180
Yeah,
I'm fortunate that I do,

656
00:31:43,370 --> 00:31:44,400
uh,
I'm so,

657
00:31:44,770 --> 00:31:45,230
you know,
so,

658
00:31:45,231 --> 00:31:49,050
so at the same high school friends and 
friends from my neighborhood when I grew

659
00:31:49,051 --> 00:31:50,580
up,
still super close to.

660
00:31:51,180 --> 00:31:52,740
And I think you're right,
you know,

661
00:31:52,750 --> 00:31:55,720
we're so lucky to have that.
And uh,

662
00:31:56,500 --> 00:32:00,030
it's still a big part of my life that 
those relationships and also,

663
00:32:00,031 --> 00:32:05,031
you know,
they can relate to the back story very 

664
00:32:05,031 --> 00:32:06,410
often.
If I meet someone now they know Jesse at

665
00:32:06,411 --> 00:32:08,250
50,
they don't know Jesse.

666
00:32:08,251 --> 00:32:10,800
It's six and Roslyn little league and 
they don't know Jesse,

667
00:32:10,840 --> 00:32:11,980
you know,
you know,

668
00:32:12,330 --> 00:32:13,240
we,
we probably a year,

669
00:32:13,241 --> 00:32:15,900
a couple of years older,
we probably played little league against

670
00:32:15,901 --> 00:32:17,400
each other.
You got a couple of years.

671
00:32:17,401 --> 00:32:17,570
Okay.

672
00:32:17,790 --> 00:32:18,120
Right,
right,

673
00:32:18,121 --> 00:32:19,920
right.
But same thing.

674
00:32:20,630 --> 00:32:22,020
Um,
so I agree with you.

675
00:32:22,470 --> 00:32:24,350
I agree with you and,
but you know,

676
00:32:24,580 --> 00:32:29,580
I,
I think all of my friends from high 

677
00:32:29,580 --> 00:32:33,261
school and even college and even today,
I mean they invest time and keeping 

678
00:32:33,421 --> 00:32:38,421
those relationships so,
and you can do it easily now through 

679
00:32:38,421 --> 00:32:38,700
facebook and social media and this kind 
of stuff,

680
00:32:39,380 --> 00:32:44,380
but often we don't.
But I'm fortunate that my group of 

681
00:32:44,380 --> 00:32:44,510
friends,
we do,

682
00:32:44,940 --> 00:32:45,850
you know,
we had for awhile,

683
00:32:45,860 --> 00:32:48,990
we have a newsletter that we put 
together for each other and um,

684
00:32:49,130 --> 00:32:50,900
it makes me smile just thinking about it
now.

685
00:32:50,901 --> 00:32:52,160
You know what I mean?
Uh,

686
00:32:52,210 --> 00:32:53,240
just feel really lucky.

687
00:32:53,400 --> 00:32:55,890
Alright,
so let's shift to your new book,

688
00:32:55,891 --> 00:32:58,650
living with the monks.
I want to get the subtitle totally right

689
00:32:58,651 --> 00:33:00,210
here because I love it.
What?

690
00:33:00,211 --> 00:33:03,270
Turning off my phone taught me about 
happiness,

691
00:33:03,570 --> 00:33:05,100
gratitude,
and focus.

692
00:33:05,101 --> 00:33:10,101
So we are taping this right now.
We're holding it for a little bit 

693
00:33:10,111 --> 00:33:15,111
because I want to air this right before 
I go off the grid because my audience 

694
00:33:15,111 --> 00:33:15,120
knows I do this.
August off the grid thing,

695
00:33:15,121 --> 00:33:18,150
literally locked my phone and it's safe.
No phone,

696
00:33:18,151 --> 00:33:19,920
no TV,
no electronics,

697
00:33:19,921 --> 00:33:24,921
no nothing.
I'm going to work on my book a little 

698
00:33:24,921 --> 00:33:27,291
bit.
I'll probably escape to a beach for a 

699
00:33:27,291 --> 00:33:27,291
little bit.
I'm not even totally sure what I'm going

700
00:33:27,291 --> 00:33:29,970
to do,
but just get off the endless information

701
00:33:29,971 --> 00:33:34,971
grid.
So before we talk about me and why I 

702
00:33:34,971 --> 00:33:37,710
think it's good to do that.
What led you to wanting to do this first

703
00:33:37,711 --> 00:33:38,100
place?

704
00:33:38,370 --> 00:33:39,420
Well,
I'd spent.

705
00:33:39,570 --> 00:33:43,150
I'd invested so much in the physical 
side for my whole life,

706
00:33:43,170 --> 00:33:48,170
you know,
running marathons and doing endurance 

707
00:33:48,170 --> 00:33:48,300
events and had a navy seal move in with 
me,

708
00:33:48,750 --> 00:33:53,750
but I really had felt like I had 
neglected the inner side and just the 

709
00:33:53,750 --> 00:33:58,020
inner work and I was just going so fast.
So I felt too to really,

710
00:33:58,590 --> 00:33:59,850
again,
maybe I'm turning to gold,

711
00:33:59,851 --> 00:34:04,851
but I don't know,
but to get the whole package or that 

712
00:34:04,851 --> 00:34:08,690
what I want and be as well rounded,
I really needed that side is the 

713
00:34:08,690 --> 00:34:09,330
spiritual side.
And um,

714
00:34:09,530 --> 00:34:12,660
and I was just thinking like,
well who would be the best teacher?

715
00:34:13,050 --> 00:34:18,050
And I thought monks and I didn't know 
anything about monks other than like 

716
00:34:18,050 --> 00:34:18,840
watching some movies,
you know,

717
00:34:18,930 --> 00:34:22,770
fringe articles here and there.
I thought that'd be really cool to learn

718
00:34:22,771 --> 00:34:23,730
about,
you know,

719
00:34:23,731 --> 00:34:25,950
the traditions and how amongst lived 
their lives.

720
00:34:25,951 --> 00:34:28,680
And I'm doing exactly what you said.
You know,

721
00:34:28,681 --> 00:34:32,880
I'm,
I'm bombarded by information and I don't

722
00:34:32,881 --> 00:34:36,960
spend any time alone.
And when you don't spend time alone,

723
00:34:36,961 --> 00:34:41,961
you lose your super power.
Use your intuition because you're being 

724
00:34:41,961 --> 00:34:43,710
influenced by everybody else and you 
don't exercise your gut muscle.

725
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:47,730
I was losing my superpower.
So I said to Sarah,

726
00:34:47,731 --> 00:34:49,230
I think I want to go in.
And

727
00:34:49,610 --> 00:34:54,610
was there a moment that you really felt 
that you had lost it or that you could 

728
00:34:54,610 --> 00:34:57,881
really recognize that you lost?
Because I think a lot of people walk 

729
00:34:57,881 --> 00:34:57,881
around with that all the time now.
I just,

730
00:34:57,881 --> 00:35:00,620
because the endless social media,
you're so hit with stuff constantly that

731
00:35:00,621 --> 00:35:05,621
it does make your,
your sort of inner monologue sort of 

732
00:35:05,621 --> 00:35:07,590
harder to listen to because it's just 
being slammed in every which direction.

733
00:35:07,591 --> 00:35:10,130
It was a buildup.
I just felt so distracted.

734
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:10,650
Yeah.

735
00:35:10,820 --> 00:35:13,130
And you know,
we all feel overwhelmed.

736
00:35:13,131 --> 00:35:18,131
I mean,
but I felt really distracted and I felt 

737
00:35:18,131 --> 00:35:18,131
like,
you know,

738
00:35:18,131 --> 00:35:20,930
I have four kids a job,
I'm married friends.

739
00:35:20,931 --> 00:35:23,600
My parents are getting older.
I mean all of these different things.

740
00:35:23,601 --> 00:35:28,601
And then all these different social 
media things and news and Netflix and 

741
00:35:28,601 --> 00:35:29,750
Hulu about like,
I just want to,

742
00:35:29,751 --> 00:35:32,570
like,
I got to just be alone.

743
00:35:33,140 --> 00:35:37,880
And so it was a buildup and then my wife
and I were talking about it as they just

744
00:35:37,890 --> 00:35:40,230
want to,
I'm going to go and live in a monastery.

745
00:35:40,231 --> 00:35:42,090
And she was super encouraging,
you know,

746
00:35:42,091 --> 00:35:43,770
and she was like,
um,

747
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:46,230
so,
so that's what happened.

748
00:35:46,260 --> 00:35:47,010
So what do you,
do?

749
00:35:47,011 --> 00:35:49,010
You give her a call,
you yellow,

750
00:35:49,270 --> 00:35:50,450
the yellow thing?
Yeah.

751
00:35:53,190 --> 00:35:53,970
Yes.
Siri,

752
00:35:54,510 --> 00:35:55,060
I,
um,

753
00:35:55,480 --> 00:36:00,480
I,
I actually found this monastery through 

754
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:02,850
a friend of mine who was actually my 
publisher and I went to a monastery with

755
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:06,480
eight monks,
which already was a misconception for me

756
00:36:06,481 --> 00:36:09,570
because I thought monastery meant 
community meant hundreds,

757
00:36:10,110 --> 00:36:15,110
but there were eight months at this 
particular monastery for which had been 

758
00:36:15,110 --> 00:36:15,110
there for 50 years.
Wow.

759
00:36:15,570 --> 00:36:17,880
And they lived on 500 acres in the 
states,

760
00:36:17,881 --> 00:36:22,881
but in isolation,
500 acres and similar to what you're 

761
00:36:22,881 --> 00:36:23,130
about to do in,
in August or now.

762
00:36:23,410 --> 00:36:24,440
Um,
you know,

763
00:36:24,510 --> 00:36:26,790
no phone,
no Internet,

764
00:36:26,850 --> 00:36:28,170
no news,
no this,

765
00:36:28,171 --> 00:36:29,910
no that,
uh,

766
00:36:30,090 --> 00:36:33,990
and I just took 15 days to decompress.
So what was it like?

767
00:36:33,991 --> 00:36:35,790
So you get there day one.
I mean,

768
00:36:35,791 --> 00:36:39,450
what was the most shocking part I got 
since you were a pretty open guy.

769
00:36:39,451 --> 00:36:41,100
So there was probably not much that 
could shock you.

770
00:36:41,101 --> 00:36:42,600
But like what do they say?

771
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:45,210
Do they take all your stuff?
First of all,

772
00:36:45,211 --> 00:36:47,370
they were Russian Orthodox.
They weren't Buddhist.

773
00:36:47,490 --> 00:36:48,960
So like that era,
I didn't,

774
00:36:48,961 --> 00:36:53,961
I had no expectation of anything.
And um,

775
00:36:55,470 --> 00:36:58,080
I walked into my room,
which they call a cell.

776
00:36:58,200 --> 00:37:03,200
That's the rooms are called sales and 
monastery and it was the size of this 

777
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:03,570
carpet like where we are and I had a 
bed,

778
00:37:03,870 --> 00:37:08,870
one little desk with a light and brother
Christopher who is like my go to monk a 

779
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:14,940
sat me down and he said,
tomorrow at 7:00

780
00:37:14,940 --> 00:37:16,230
AM,
we'll start with prayer,

781
00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:18,060
reflect,
reflection and meditation.

782
00:37:18,940 --> 00:37:19,770
And I said,
okay,

783
00:37:20,520 --> 00:37:21,360
it's 6:00
PM,

784
00:37:22,110 --> 00:37:24,600
what do I do next?
Thirteen hours.

785
00:37:25,140 --> 00:37:27,630
And he looked at me and he said,
you think?

786
00:37:28,830 --> 00:37:31,020
And I said,
okay.

787
00:37:31,080 --> 00:37:34,050
And he left the room and I realized 
like,

788
00:37:34,170 --> 00:37:36,810
I can't call my wife.
I can't.

789
00:37:36,930 --> 00:37:41,930
There's no books in my room.
I mean they had books but there are no 

790
00:37:41,930 --> 00:37:41,930
books.

791
00:37:41,930 --> 00:37:44,680
There's no like,
it's super like required.

792
00:37:45,480 --> 00:37:46,400
And I'm like,
alright,

793
00:37:46,470 --> 00:37:47,610
I'm going to,
I'm going to meditate.

794
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,100
Let me start the journey.
I took a TM,

795
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:53,490
transcendental meditation course,
set my timer for 20 minutes.

796
00:37:53,491 --> 00:37:56,820
I sat in my chair and I started to close
my eyes,

797
00:37:56,821 --> 00:38:00,540
focused on that mantra and I'm getting 
bombarded.

798
00:38:00,600 --> 00:38:01,650
Boy,
how am my kids,

799
00:38:01,651 --> 00:38:02,480
my wife,
you know,

800
00:38:02,500 --> 00:38:04,160
the hawks are going to be,
what are we going to do this?

801
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:09,560
Everything's going through my head and 
we will talk about the hawks were done 

802
00:38:09,560 --> 00:38:10,110
by the way.
I'm sitting and I'm going and I'm like,

803
00:38:10,200 --> 00:38:13,560
why isn't my beeper beep because I've 
been here forever and I'm like,

804
00:38:13,620 --> 00:38:16,670
I probably didn't start it,
so let me just keep going,

805
00:38:16,690 --> 00:38:18,510
keep going.
And finally there's no beep.

806
00:38:19,080 --> 00:38:19,590
And I said,
well,

807
00:38:19,591 --> 00:38:22,440
let me just reset my beeper and I'll 
start over though.

808
00:38:22,530 --> 00:38:23,130
I go back.

809
00:38:23,130 --> 00:38:24,780
That will be cheating.
Anyway,

810
00:38:24,781 --> 00:38:26,910
I in my chair forever and I finally 
like,

811
00:38:26,911 --> 00:38:31,911
this is ridiculous.
I'll just let me reset this and start 

812
00:38:31,911 --> 00:38:31,911
this again.
And I opened up my eyes.

813
00:38:31,911 --> 00:38:33,870
I looked at my time or three minutes and
27 seconds.

814
00:38:33,950 --> 00:38:38,200
Wow.
And I calculated how many minutes I have

815
00:38:38,201 --> 00:38:42,280
left on the monastery.
I did 15 days,

816
00:38:42,281 --> 00:38:45,430
times 24 times.
And I was like,

817
00:38:45,590 --> 00:38:47,260
wow.
I just said to myself,

818
00:38:47,290 --> 00:38:52,290
I'm fucked like this is,
this is great on paper in theory,

819
00:38:53,680 --> 00:38:58,680
but this is gonna be fucking hard.
And I just sat in my room and I was 

820
00:38:58,680 --> 00:38:59,830
like,
oh my God,

821
00:39:00,360 --> 00:39:03,580
what did I get myself into?
Were you allowed to leave the room?

822
00:39:03,850 --> 00:39:07,450
I couldn't leave the room,
I couldn't leave the property.

823
00:39:07,930 --> 00:39:12,930
This is the craziest situation.
So the monks to keep the lights on at 

824
00:39:12,930 --> 00:39:15,280
the monastery,
they breed German shepherds.

825
00:39:15,880 --> 00:39:20,680
So there were 11 adult German shepherds,
eight monks and nick.

826
00:39:21,220 --> 00:39:25,780
So they're selling German shepherd 
puppies and they trained dogs.

827
00:39:25,781 --> 00:39:29,710
They're world renown dog trainers,
world's,

828
00:39:29,711 --> 00:39:34,711
they've written books,
they've sold millions of copies of 

829
00:39:34,711 --> 00:39:34,711
books.
They're just,

830
00:39:34,711 --> 00:39:36,700
it's just a really unusual scenario.
So yes,

831
00:39:36,701 --> 00:39:40,180
I could leave my cell and walk around 
the monastery,

832
00:39:40,181 --> 00:39:42,280
but first of all,
it's 40 degrees outside.

833
00:39:42,940 --> 00:39:44,340
It's,
there's no lights.

834
00:39:44,710 --> 00:39:48,100
It's like pitch dark at 4:00.
It's freezing.

835
00:39:48,130 --> 00:39:50,230
There's bear according to the monks,
like.

836
00:39:50,380 --> 00:39:51,700
So,
no,

837
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:54,700
I really couldn't leave.
So I mean I just kinda like,

838
00:39:55,110 --> 00:39:59,290
um,
I ended up walking 120 miles up and down

839
00:39:59,350 --> 00:40:04,350
the driveway they had because I had to 
get some exercise over the course of my 

840
00:40:04,350 --> 00:40:04,350
journey,
but I didn't,

841
00:40:04,350 --> 00:40:05,590
I didn't leave.
So,

842
00:40:05,640 --> 00:40:08,710
um,
I just sat there and you know,

843
00:40:09,250 --> 00:40:12,670
the first five days,
five days was really,

844
00:40:12,671 --> 00:40:17,671
really difficult for me and I started 
immediately doing probably what I think 

845
00:40:18,251 --> 00:40:19,090
most people do.

846
00:40:19,120 --> 00:40:22,270
Certainly what I do,
I started giving myself an out.

847
00:40:22,300 --> 00:40:25,720
I started justifying that it will be 
okay to go home early,

848
00:40:26,920 --> 00:40:28,570
just seven days,
man,

849
00:40:28,750 --> 00:40:31,030
that's enough.
Get out of here in seven days.

850
00:40:31,330 --> 00:40:33,030
No one's gonna say,
oh you didn't do whatever.

851
00:40:33,610 --> 00:40:38,610
And I started creating all these excuses
in my head and I started thinking about 

852
00:40:38,610 --> 00:40:40,300
like,
what are the goals do I have in areas of

853
00:40:40,301 --> 00:40:43,900
my life and my giving excuses in,
you know,

854
00:40:44,320 --> 00:40:49,320
and really started to like analyze 
everything that was going through my 

855
00:40:49,320 --> 00:40:52,240
head and put it into out the real my 
real world.

856
00:40:53,020 --> 00:40:55,720
And I just saw a lot of things about 
myself,

857
00:40:55,960 --> 00:40:56,680
you know,
through the,

858
00:40:56,710 --> 00:41:00,720
through just being quiet and alone.
How did you break through that moment of

859
00:41:00,730 --> 00:41:05,730
I can get away with seven days here.
Like what was the actual thing that 

860
00:41:05,730 --> 00:41:07,390
turned down that I have a two words that
changed my life,

861
00:41:07,630 --> 00:41:11,920
that I refer back to all the time and 
I'm the.

862
00:41:12,010 --> 00:41:14,560
When I wanted to go home,
those two words were like,

863
00:41:14,710 --> 00:41:17,750
I signed up for 15 days.
That's what,

864
00:41:17,770 --> 00:41:22,770
that's what this goal was 15 days,
day five when I really want to go home 

865
00:41:22,961 --> 00:41:24,930
and I missed my kids and I couldn't call
them.

866
00:41:24,940 --> 00:41:26,590
You know,
the two words are,

867
00:41:26,591 --> 00:41:31,591
remember tomorrow when you have a big 
split second decision or a big major 

868
00:41:31,811 --> 00:41:33,410
decision,
how,

869
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:35,600
how is that decision going to make you 
feel tomorrow?

870
00:41:36,350 --> 00:41:39,320
So I said to myself,
if I drop out and quit now,

871
00:41:39,350 --> 00:41:41,570
the one time I'm going to do this in my 
life,

872
00:41:41,960 --> 00:41:44,180
how am I going to feel about this 
tomorrow when I get home?

873
00:41:44,181 --> 00:41:45,980
When someone says,
how'd you do?

874
00:41:46,040 --> 00:41:49,490
Did you make it terrible?
You know,

875
00:41:49,850 --> 00:41:52,730
my legs are swollen at mile 18,
I want to drop out of the race.

876
00:41:52,731 --> 00:41:57,731
So the marathon,
but I don't want to come home the next 

877
00:41:57,731 --> 00:41:57,731
day after the New York marathon.
Did you finish?

878
00:41:57,950 --> 00:42:02,950
So remember tomorrow.
So I just kind of said that to myself 

879
00:42:02,950 --> 00:42:06,640
over and over,
like just remember how you gonna feel 

880
00:42:06,640 --> 00:42:08,210
about this and remember how proud you're
going to feel at the end of the journey.

881
00:42:09,050 --> 00:42:10,430
And before I went,
my wife said,

882
00:42:10,431 --> 00:42:12,050
don't leave until you have a 
breakthrough.

883
00:42:12,051 --> 00:42:14,360
You're broken.
And I'm like,

884
00:42:14,361 --> 00:42:16,760
I'm not broken and I haven't had a 
breakthrough.

885
00:42:17,750 --> 00:42:18,200
I'm saying,

886
00:42:19,500 --> 00:42:21,330
so did you get broken or have a 
breakthrough?

887
00:42:22,030 --> 00:42:22,720
You know,
it's funny.

888
00:42:22,721 --> 00:42:27,721
I actually know the answer,
at least the one that had some 

889
00:42:27,721 --> 00:42:28,750
breakthroughs for sure.
But I never felt broken.

890
00:42:29,910 --> 00:42:34,910
And I think,
I think the reason I never felt broken 

891
00:42:34,910 --> 00:42:34,910
is because it had a definitive end date.
Yeah.

892
00:42:34,910 --> 00:42:34,910
So

893
00:42:35,220 --> 00:42:37,170
confer you would have been like,
I'm leaving.

894
00:42:37,380 --> 00:42:38,250
Okay.
Would it be like.

895
00:42:38,590 --> 00:42:43,590
Yeah,
it would have to really take me to a 

896
00:42:43,590 --> 00:42:43,590
place of,
you know.

897
00:42:43,590 --> 00:42:44,350
Yeah.
Yeah.

898
00:42:44,380 --> 00:42:47,770
I mean I had moments of being broken and
Super Sad.

899
00:42:47,771 --> 00:42:49,330
I mean,
you know,

900
00:42:49,331 --> 00:42:52,090
like when you're away from everything 
and you don't know what's going on,

901
00:42:53,020 --> 00:42:58,020
you just don't know.
You don't know God on my kids getting 

902
00:42:58,020 --> 00:42:58,020
bullied.
Is something happening?

903
00:42:58,020 --> 00:42:59,770
Is My wife okay?
You know,

904
00:42:59,771 --> 00:43:04,771
is the world in risk is just don't know.
And you start to imagine that the 

905
00:43:07,331 --> 00:43:12,331
world's going to end.
Your brain automatically goes to the 

906
00:43:12,331 --> 00:43:12,331
word.
It doesn't go to everything.

907
00:43:12,331 --> 00:43:13,090
It's great.
It's like,

908
00:43:13,150 --> 00:43:18,150
Oh shit,
I should've been so much nicer to my 

909
00:43:18,150 --> 00:43:20,071
wife because I'm going to go there.
She's not going to be home when I get 

910
00:43:20,071 --> 00:43:22,831
home.
Like you start sticking shit like that 

911
00:43:22,831 --> 00:43:25,770
and then it just spirals because you 
have energy and space to think and 

912
00:43:26,891 --> 00:43:30,200
imagine and dream and envision and all 
the shit that's like.

913
00:43:30,210 --> 00:43:33,610
It all comes to the surface and you 
know,

914
00:43:33,760 --> 00:43:36,970
because it's in the real world.
If you're having a tough day,

915
00:43:38,470 --> 00:43:39,450
you could say to Dave,
you,

916
00:43:39,460 --> 00:43:40,230
you,
you guys go,

917
00:43:40,270 --> 00:43:45,270
you know what?
Let's put on a movie in my Netflix and 

918
00:43:45,270 --> 00:43:45,270
just fucking escape.
And you sit down,

919
00:43:45,270 --> 00:43:48,040
you order Chinese food and you have your
Netflix and you'll watch it.

920
00:43:48,041 --> 00:43:50,470
But guess what?
The issues don't go away.

921
00:43:51,190 --> 00:43:56,190
When the movie's over,
that Shit is still there on your to do 

922
00:43:56,190 --> 00:43:59,461
list.
They're still there when I'm watching 

923
00:43:59,461 --> 00:44:00,110
that,
but they're still there and you know,

924
00:44:00,130 --> 00:44:02,440
this forced you.
There was no escape.

925
00:44:03,220 --> 00:44:07,390
This was your escape.
So it forced me to have to think through

926
00:44:07,391 --> 00:44:08,710
stuff and I got a lot of clarity.

927
00:44:09,550 --> 00:44:14,550
Although this is in no way comparable,
when I did my off the grid thing last 

928
00:44:14,550 --> 00:44:15,400
year and it for a week we were 10 days 
or so.

929
00:44:15,401 --> 00:44:18,190
We were in Mexico and I just,
I just needed to do nothing.

930
00:44:18,460 --> 00:44:22,120
I just needed to wake up every morning,
have a light breakfast.

931
00:44:22,121 --> 00:44:23,560
I went to the gym and then I would just 
sit.

932
00:44:23,580 --> 00:44:28,580
I got the same seat at the beach every 
day and I would just sit and stare at 

933
00:44:28,580 --> 00:44:30,880
the ocean for hours really for hours and
I do try to do a little meditation and.

934
00:44:31,920 --> 00:44:34,560
But I did have that moment at one point 
where I was like,

935
00:44:34,710 --> 00:44:39,710
anything could be happening right now 
like world war three could be starting 

936
00:44:39,710 --> 00:44:41,580
their terror attack,
like a Zombie apocalypse.

937
00:44:41,581 --> 00:44:43,680
Like where you go to like the craziest 
shit.

938
00:44:43,681 --> 00:44:45,090
And then I remember thinking,
I was like,

939
00:44:45,091 --> 00:44:50,091
you know,
you go there for awhile and then I 

940
00:44:50,091 --> 00:44:50,091
suddenly got to the end of it and I was 
like,

941
00:44:50,091 --> 00:44:50,610
well,
nothing I can do about it right now.

942
00:44:50,611 --> 00:44:53,790
So I better reset to this,
to this better place.

943
00:44:53,940 --> 00:44:55,890
And there's a real discipline in that 
in.

944
00:44:55,940 --> 00:44:58,200
And how you can control your mind and 
your thoughts.

945
00:44:58,410 --> 00:45:03,410
I think for sure the first three or four
days there I was obsessed with my to do 

946
00:45:03,410 --> 00:45:07,941
list and by day four or five I'm like,
if a hurricane came and whisked my to do

947
00:45:09,391 --> 00:45:13,380
list into the ocean,
life goes on,

948
00:45:13,860 --> 00:45:16,350
like I'll be okay.
And you know,

949
00:45:16,351 --> 00:45:21,351
I was,
I was like a captive to my to do list 

950
00:45:21,351 --> 00:45:21,530
because,
you know,

951
00:45:21,531 --> 00:45:23,850
I'm always.
And it's my to do list for me,

952
00:45:23,851 --> 00:45:28,530
it wasn't even about finishing the tasks
as good as I could possibly do.

953
00:45:28,531 --> 00:45:30,210
Um,
it was about finishing up so I can keep.

954
00:45:30,450 --> 00:45:35,450
It felt so good to cross them off that 
even if it was 70 percent to what I 

955
00:45:35,450 --> 00:45:37,470
could probably do it.
Go onto the next,

956
00:45:37,530 --> 00:45:39,600
onto the next,
onto the next,

957
00:45:39,900 --> 00:45:43,440
at the monastery.
The monks only had to do list.

958
00:45:43,980 --> 00:45:48,980
There was no to do list.
It was whatever is in front of me is my 

959
00:45:48,980 --> 00:45:49,560
task at hand.

960
00:45:49,680 --> 00:45:52,620
So tell me a little bit just sort of 
what that day looks like.

961
00:45:52,621 --> 00:45:55,760
So you get up the next morning,
now it's day to day said,

962
00:45:55,770 --> 00:45:57,240
did you say 7:00
AM or 6:00

963
00:45:57,240 --> 00:45:57,900
AM?
Seven am.

964
00:45:58,110 --> 00:45:59,210
And then prayer starts.

965
00:45:59,270 --> 00:46:00,560
Yeah.
So they would ring a big,

966
00:46:00,620 --> 00:46:02,990
a big like notre dame,
Notre Dame.

967
00:46:02,991 --> 00:46:07,640
We like Church Val.
I was right next to which was the,

968
00:46:07,670 --> 00:46:12,670
which signaled to go to the,
to the church where we would have a bad,

969
00:46:13,671 --> 00:46:17,360
an hour and a half service.
Which was meditation,

970
00:46:17,750 --> 00:46:19,910
reflection,
service.

971
00:46:20,320 --> 00:46:22,240
What was it?
Religious in any way?

972
00:46:22,241 --> 00:46:23,460
Yeah,
they were Russian Orthodox.

973
00:46:23,750 --> 00:46:24,860
It was,
it was a religion,

974
00:46:24,861 --> 00:46:29,180
it was religious for me it was,
it was peaceful,

975
00:46:29,660 --> 00:46:31,730
um,
but it was definitely,

976
00:46:31,880 --> 00:46:33,520
definitely religious.
And then,

977
00:46:33,780 --> 00:46:38,780
and then we would shift to um,
breakfast which was traditionally 

978
00:46:38,991 --> 00:46:40,730
silent.
Most of those breakfast,

979
00:46:40,731 --> 00:46:43,880
the breakfast we're silent and that 
would go to,

980
00:46:43,881 --> 00:46:48,881
let's say nine,
30 or 10 and afterwards there'll be a 

981
00:46:48,881 --> 00:46:51,500
little bit of alone time and then it 
would go to tasks and each of the months

982
00:46:51,501 --> 00:46:55,520
would have a different responsibility,
which was just unbelievably efficient.

983
00:46:56,150 --> 00:46:58,820
And I spent each day shadowing a 
different monks.

984
00:46:58,821 --> 00:47:01,380
So I got two rounds basically.
Uh,

985
00:47:01,381 --> 00:47:04,250
and then there would be supper.
Dinner was lunchtime,

986
00:47:04,251 --> 00:47:07,550
so they flip flop.
So breakfast was a really light meal,

987
00:47:07,790 --> 00:47:10,220
which for me is just fruit.
Then lunch,

988
00:47:10,280 --> 00:47:12,080
their lunch was dinner.
That would be the big meal.

989
00:47:12,620 --> 00:47:14,880
Rest or sleep away.
Camp you go,

990
00:47:15,010 --> 00:47:17,900
the less time you will see us have more 
labor,

991
00:47:18,290 --> 00:47:20,190
which could be cleaning the church,
doing something,

992
00:47:20,200 --> 00:47:22,140
whatever the everyone's tasks were.

993
00:47:22,960 --> 00:47:25,460
They always have stuff to do because 
it's like,

994
00:47:25,600 --> 00:47:26,920
it's kind of funny,
like if you think about it,

995
00:47:26,921 --> 00:47:27,280
like,
all right,

996
00:47:27,281 --> 00:47:29,830
so eight guys living at this place,
you're always stuff.

997
00:47:29,990 --> 00:47:32,020
Oh it seems like there wouldn't be that 
much more to do,

998
00:47:32,080 --> 00:47:33,500
you know,
because you don't want to know why.

999
00:47:33,501 --> 00:47:34,900
If,
if the toilet breaks,

1000
00:47:35,200 --> 00:47:37,270
they don't call a plumber to fix the 
toilet.

1001
00:47:37,450 --> 00:47:40,150
They built the monastery by hand.
They,

1002
00:47:40,330 --> 00:47:42,220
everything is,
they do everything.

1003
00:47:42,310 --> 00:47:43,460
Right?
Well let's,

1004
00:47:43,600 --> 00:47:45,120
let's get a swimming pool.
Okay.

1005
00:47:45,640 --> 00:47:48,190
Get a shovel,
you get a shovel and you get a shovel,

1006
00:47:48,250 --> 00:47:50,350
you know,
let's figure out how to do it,

1007
00:47:50,351 --> 00:47:54,200
you know,
and we'll build a swimming pool fees.

1008
00:47:54,250 --> 00:47:56,350
So they do probably hire you for a 
couple of jobs.

1009
00:47:56,650 --> 00:47:58,880
Do anything.
I was a supervisor,

1010
00:47:59,790 --> 00:48:01,510
um,
and then,

1011
00:48:01,600 --> 00:48:05,020
and then we would,
there was just more time alone.

1012
00:48:05,350 --> 00:48:06,970
So there was a tremendous amount of 
time.

1013
00:48:07,310 --> 00:48:09,370
Yeah.
But also a lot of work.

1014
00:48:09,850 --> 00:48:12,820
So talk a little bit about the 
disconnecting from technology.

1015
00:48:12,821 --> 00:48:15,040
I get the concerns about your wife,
your kids,

1016
00:48:15,041 --> 00:48:15,760
things like that.

1017
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:21,000
How did you feel about not putting your 
hand in your pocket to go to your phone 

1018
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:24,961
or not having an ipad right in front of 
you or television screen or the rest of 

1019
00:48:24,961 --> 00:48:24,961
it?
You know,

1020
00:48:24,961 --> 00:48:26,740
it's funny because when I got back 
everybody asks me,

1021
00:48:26,741 --> 00:48:27,580
well,
what did you miss?

1022
00:48:28,090 --> 00:48:30,610
The obvious answers I missed my family 
and this and that,

1023
00:48:30,611 --> 00:48:33,280
but no one ever asked me what didn't you
miss?

1024
00:48:33,880 --> 00:48:38,800
And when I didn't miss at all were 
things that I do everyday that I thought

1025
00:48:38,801 --> 00:48:41,020
I would miss.
For example,

1026
00:48:41,080 --> 00:48:46,080
I went during the NCAA tournament.
I didn't miss not watching March 

1027
00:48:46,080 --> 00:48:47,140
madness.
It's been a pivot,

1028
00:48:47,320 --> 00:48:52,320
been something I've loved to do forever.
And if I calculated how many hours of 

1029
00:48:52,320 --> 00:48:54,060
basketball I've watched,
it's like,

1030
00:48:54,260 --> 00:48:56,260
you know,
it's probably years of my life,

1031
00:48:56,620 --> 00:48:59,460
but I didn't miss it and I didn't miss 
hitting like that,

1032
00:48:59,520 --> 00:49:04,520
you know,
liking my friend's picture and can Kuhn 

1033
00:49:04,520 --> 00:49:04,520
with,
with,

1034
00:49:04,520 --> 00:49:04,520
with a corona.

1035
00:49:04,540 --> 00:49:09,540
I didn't miss any of that stuff.
I didn't miss going through Hulu and 

1036
00:49:09,540 --> 00:49:12,790
Netflix and debating with my wife what 
to watch and I realized I spent a lot of

1037
00:49:12,791 --> 00:49:15,280
time on things that I really didn't 
miss.

1038
00:49:16,360 --> 00:49:21,360
And if I eliminated some of those I 
would freed up a lot more time to spend 

1039
00:49:21,360 --> 00:49:22,570
to do the things I love to do with 
people I love to do them with.

1040
00:49:22,770 --> 00:49:23,770
Yeah.
So,

1041
00:49:23,800 --> 00:49:27,730
but it was so comfortable with my phone 
is always in my hand.

1042
00:49:28,180 --> 00:49:29,380
It was hard,
man.

1043
00:49:29,740 --> 00:49:30,820
Really hard.
It took,

1044
00:49:30,850 --> 00:49:35,850
it took a long time to get past that.
Did you feel that there was like a 

1045
00:49:35,850 --> 00:49:36,430
little bit of a learning curve with it?
Like when I did it and as I said,

1046
00:49:36,431 --> 00:49:41,431
I locked my phone and a safe.
I did not know the code and I found it 

1047
00:49:41,431 --> 00:49:41,800
for the first day or two.

1048
00:49:41,800 --> 00:49:44,230
I kept going in my pocket even at the 
beach,

1049
00:49:44,231 --> 00:49:46,150
like I'm just going to be,
but there's nothing in my pocket.

1050
00:49:46,151 --> 00:49:47,440
I don't even think my shorts had 
pockets,

1051
00:49:47,441 --> 00:49:48,730
so I was just like,
go like this.

1052
00:49:49,090 --> 00:49:50,930
And then there's like this weird anxiety
of like,

1053
00:49:50,980 --> 00:49:53,350
what's going on,
what did I miss is the Zombie apocalypse

1054
00:49:53,351 --> 00:49:56,830
or the war started or whatever.
And then suddenly by day like five,

1055
00:49:56,831 --> 00:49:59,860
I kind of felt empowered by day eight.
I was like,

1056
00:49:59,890 --> 00:50:04,890
I want nothing to do with that.
Then maybe there's a little bit of like 

1057
00:50:04,890 --> 00:50:05,560
a return to a.
it'll be okay.

1058
00:50:05,561 --> 00:50:08,860
I'll manage it differently.
Did you go through all of the exact,

1059
00:50:08,890 --> 00:50:12,090
the exact steps that you just mentioned 
in the exact timeframe you just,

1060
00:50:13,080 --> 00:50:18,080
um,
once I got to the point where I didn't 

1061
00:50:18,080 --> 00:50:21,481
miss it,
where the habit of checking before I 

1062
00:50:21,481 --> 00:50:24,601
went to bed or waking up at five in the 
morning and seeing anything new come in 

1063
00:50:24,601 --> 00:50:24,601
through,
you know,

1064
00:50:25,050 --> 00:50:27,710
once I got past that,
uh,

1065
00:50:27,830 --> 00:50:29,180
I just,
I didn't miss it.

1066
00:50:29,181 --> 00:50:31,390
I didn't want it,
you know,

1067
00:50:31,700 --> 00:50:35,150
and once I got home and I put on the 
news and read,

1068
00:50:35,270 --> 00:50:40,270
you know,
like what's going on in the world and 

1069
00:50:40,270 --> 00:50:40,270
all the negative stuff,
it was just like,

1070
00:50:40,270 --> 00:50:41,750
ugh.
But here I am,

1071
00:50:41,840 --> 00:50:44,120
I've been home and now I'm back on my 
phone and I came home.

1072
00:50:44,121 --> 00:50:47,870
I'm like,
I'm off email and then you know,

1073
00:50:47,900 --> 00:50:49,580
but you drift back.
So

1074
00:50:49,830 --> 00:50:54,830
have you been able to put any kind of 
just personal policies in place to 

1075
00:50:54,830 --> 00:50:56,010
manage this stuff?
Because I'm still trying.

1076
00:50:56,011 --> 00:50:58,740
I don't do phone and bedroom 90 percent 
of the nights.

1077
00:50:58,741 --> 00:51:00,600
Every now and again it just somehow ends
up there.

1078
00:51:00,601 --> 00:51:02,790
But like that's one for me.
So that at 5:00

1079
00:51:02,790 --> 00:51:02,980
AM I just

1080
00:51:03,090 --> 00:51:06,300
don't do that.
I've been the obvious ones,

1081
00:51:06,301 --> 00:51:06,860
you know?
No,

1082
00:51:07,140 --> 00:51:09,390
not in the bedroom,
not at meal time,

1083
00:51:09,630 --> 00:51:14,630
not in movies.
I'm and I used to sit and movies and I 

1084
00:51:14,630 --> 00:51:15,990
heard a ding or a beep or a buzz.
I go into my shirt,

1085
00:51:16,020 --> 00:51:19,290
looked like the light to look under 
here,

1086
00:51:19,920 --> 00:51:21,060
but now,
so there's.

1087
00:51:21,061 --> 00:51:26,061
So I became this.
I think this will summarize my 

1088
00:51:26,061 --> 00:51:30,141
experience the best.
They had a retreat at the monastery and 

1089
00:51:30,141 --> 00:51:31,620
they had all these guests and the guests
left.

1090
00:51:31,621 --> 00:51:32,880
They said to me,
Jesse,

1091
00:51:33,450 --> 00:51:36,120
you're going to clean up all the dishes 
like the,

1092
00:51:36,180 --> 00:51:38,450
like the rookie on the team.
Okay.

1093
00:51:39,090 --> 00:51:42,780
There's 500 dishes stacked.
So I started cleaning the dishes and I'm

1094
00:51:42,781 --> 00:51:47,781
drawing.
I'm in cleaning up and drying them and 

1095
00:51:47,781 --> 00:51:47,940
they go and they bring more in and I 
turned to them.

1096
00:51:47,941 --> 00:51:49,500
I'm like,
I'm just going to take me forever.

1097
00:51:49,501 --> 00:51:53,070
How am I going to do all these dishes?
And one of the monks certainly goes,

1098
00:51:53,310 --> 00:51:58,310
there's not all those dishes.
There's only the dish that's in your 

1099
00:51:58,310 --> 00:51:59,400
hand.
And I was like,

1100
00:51:59,760 --> 00:52:04,760
it reminded me that I'm never wearing my
feet are and I got to be where my feet 

1101
00:52:04,760 --> 00:52:05,790
are,
you know,

1102
00:52:06,060 --> 00:52:07,020
this is what I'm doing.

1103
00:52:07,080 --> 00:52:12,080
Yeah,
there's something there because I do 

1104
00:52:12,080 --> 00:52:12,090
find that I actually liked doing the 
dishes.

1105
00:52:12,210 --> 00:52:14,140
I know that's a little nuts and I'm not 
doing it for.

1106
00:52:14,370 --> 00:52:17,250
I'm not doing it for 500 people,
but I do find it's like one of like,

1107
00:52:17,251 --> 00:52:19,950
I can't have my phone in my hand while 
I'm doing the dishes.

1108
00:52:19,951 --> 00:52:20,630
Right.
Like I,

1109
00:52:20,880 --> 00:52:23,940
it's one little thing that you're doing 
right there.

1110
00:52:24,060 --> 00:52:25,740
So I do find on these brief moments 
that,

1111
00:52:25,741 --> 00:52:26,150
you know,
you know,

1112
00:52:26,160 --> 00:52:27,870
I'm on tour right now and it's like when
I'm doing this,

1113
00:52:27,871 --> 00:52:31,620
when I have these brief moments,
I like doing very menial.

1114
00:52:31,621 --> 00:52:36,621
Like I really like gardening or just 
like cleaning up outside or like these 

1115
00:52:36,621 --> 00:52:40,341
things that aren't much because they 
seem to have this incredible importance.

1116
00:52:40,720 --> 00:52:45,670
We've lost touch with a lot of those 
things that help us feel connected.

1117
00:52:45,750 --> 00:52:47,920
You know,
like we have no connection to our food.

1118
00:52:48,490 --> 00:52:53,490
We go to a supermarket,
we didn't know unless you live on a 

1119
00:52:53,490 --> 00:52:55,741
farm.
Like we're very disconnected from a lot 

1120
00:52:55,741 --> 00:52:58,681
of things that make us tick and simple 
things like that bring us back down to 

1121
00:52:58,681 --> 00:53:02,050
earth and they ground us and I felt the 
same way.

1122
00:53:02,110 --> 00:53:07,110
I felt up as a contributor even if it's 
contributing to your own household,

1123
00:53:07,300 --> 00:53:10,390
you know?
And as opposed to having someone to come

1124
00:53:10,391 --> 00:53:12,970
in and clean it or however you guys do 
it or whatever.

1125
00:53:13,310 --> 00:53:15,430
Um,
but it makes you feel connected.

1126
00:53:15,440 --> 00:53:19,090
Important part of it.
And uh,

1127
00:53:19,960 --> 00:53:22,720
it creates momentum and winds.
I can't explain it,

1128
00:53:22,721 --> 00:53:25,350
but I felt the same way.
I love it.

1129
00:53:25,351 --> 00:53:27,350
I was volunteering for it.
Yeah.

1130
00:53:27,450 --> 00:53:28,440
There's real value in that.

1131
00:53:28,440 --> 00:53:29,970
Like even when you came into my house 
and you're like,

1132
00:53:29,971 --> 00:53:31,240
oh,
it's so great here and this and that.

1133
00:53:31,241 --> 00:53:35,160
And it's like I really love like we put 
a lot of effort into like I want to like

1134
00:53:35,161 --> 00:53:40,161
wake up in the place that I want to be 
at and like make it better and make it 

1135
00:53:40,161 --> 00:53:41,910
more valuable than that.
So for the average person that can maybe

1136
00:53:42,090 --> 00:53:46,020
take a month to do this,
what's the piece of advice?

1137
00:53:46,021 --> 00:53:48,030
Or is it.
Can people do a weekend with monks?

1138
00:53:48,031 --> 00:53:50,070
Can you,
can you just do a day with me?

1139
00:53:50,230 --> 00:53:51,060
I think it.
Listen,

1140
00:53:51,061 --> 00:53:53,070
I think.
I think anyone could spend time alone.

1141
00:53:53,160 --> 00:53:58,160
Yeah.
I think spending time alone and you 

1142
00:53:58,160 --> 00:54:00,621
reckon I recognize like I don't spend 
any time alone other than going for 

1143
00:54:00,621 --> 00:54:00,621
runs,
which is,

1144
00:54:00,621 --> 00:54:05,240
you know,
but I think it's really important 

1145
00:54:05,240 --> 00:54:07,371
because I think the only way you can 
really be in tune with your gut is to 

1146
00:54:07,371 --> 00:54:08,010
spend some time alone.

1147
00:54:08,370 --> 00:54:10,800
So I think that's really important.
I think for me,

1148
00:54:11,100 --> 00:54:13,890
I carry a lot of stuff in my head.
I realized that I need to,

1149
00:54:13,891 --> 00:54:16,260
like I put everything on paper,
now I get out of my head,

1150
00:54:16,261 --> 00:54:19,140
it doesn't disappear,
but it frees up space.

1151
00:54:19,540 --> 00:54:23,340
I had a lot of space and creative energy
at the monastery because I didn't have,

1152
00:54:23,430 --> 00:54:28,430
I wasn't cluttered.
So now I have a two journal system that 

1153
00:54:28,430 --> 00:54:28,430
I use.
It's very simple.

1154
00:54:28,430 --> 00:54:29,970
I dumped everything into one big 
journal.

1155
00:54:30,030 --> 00:54:31,950
Doesn't go away,
but it's out of my head.

1156
00:54:31,970 --> 00:54:36,970
Yeah.
I don't have to remember I to get a kid 

1157
00:54:36,970 --> 00:54:38,961
at birthday present or whatever,
and then I make my daily kind of routine

1158
00:54:39,321 --> 00:54:40,200
and,
and,

1159
00:54:40,230 --> 00:54:42,480
and this kind of thing.
And um,

1160
00:54:42,960 --> 00:54:45,300
yeah,
I think just being really aware of where

1161
00:54:45,301 --> 00:54:49,680
your feet are is really important.
I mean the monks are Mano taskers.

1162
00:54:49,980 --> 00:54:53,730
I live in a world of multitasking and I 
think that,

1163
00:54:53,760 --> 00:54:54,900
you know,
for the everyday,

1164
00:54:54,960 --> 00:54:58,220
for everybody I think that feels 
overwhelmed or feel,

1165
00:54:58,410 --> 00:55:03,410
feels distracted,
is to do one thing at a time and do it 

1166
00:55:03,410 --> 00:55:07,911
well and move on.
Have you been back to the monastery 

1167
00:55:07,911 --> 00:55:07,911
since?
I'm going to go.

1168
00:55:07,911 --> 00:55:12,471
I haven't been back.
We're not planning on going to go back 

1169
00:55:12,471 --> 00:55:12,740
to partake again or is it just like,
can you go like,

1170
00:55:12,780 --> 00:55:17,780
have lunch with them?
At least just for some high fives I met 

1171
00:55:17,780 --> 00:55:17,780
like they're down for that sort of 
thing.

1172
00:55:17,970 --> 00:55:19,470
Like the for some.
Yeah,

1173
00:55:19,500 --> 00:55:21,660
for some high fives.
I guess you'll figure it out.

1174
00:55:21,720 --> 00:55:24,020
I mean I was like an alien.
I came here,

1175
00:55:24,030 --> 00:55:25,450
I was full of energy.
I'm like,

1176
00:55:25,740 --> 00:55:26,400
oh,
like we're.

1177
00:55:26,401 --> 00:55:27,580
What are we running?
Did they,

1178
00:55:27,630 --> 00:55:29,580
did they have any idea of your history 
or just,

1179
00:55:29,810 --> 00:55:31,920
you know,
your success is any of that stuff.

1180
00:55:31,950 --> 00:55:34,290
They just think it's just some guy.
Yeah,

1181
00:55:34,320 --> 00:55:36,060
we're letting in on this.
I don't remember.

1182
00:55:36,070 --> 00:55:37,680
That must've been pretty cool in and of 
itself.

1183
00:55:38,010 --> 00:55:40,890
I remember very clearly sitting down and
I was telling him about my journey.

1184
00:55:40,891 --> 00:55:43,620
I was talking about coconut water and 
they all looked at me and said,

1185
00:55:43,970 --> 00:55:44,860
what's going on?
What?

1186
00:55:45,870 --> 00:55:48,450
I was talking about the Atlanta Hawks 
and one of them raised their hand,

1187
00:55:48,451 --> 00:55:51,390
said I went to an expos game,
well in Montreal,

1188
00:55:51,391 --> 00:55:53,980
and I'm like,
that's baseball anymore.

1189
00:55:55,170 --> 00:55:56,910
Like,
all right,

1190
00:55:56,911 --> 00:56:01,911
well for our last few minutes,
let's talk about the hawks for a second 

1191
00:56:01,911 --> 00:56:02,940
and just own you own a basketball team,
which to me is,

1192
00:56:02,941 --> 00:56:04,320
as you know,
I love basketball.

1193
00:56:04,321 --> 00:56:06,480
Like that's like the greatest thing on 
earth.

1194
00:56:07,100 --> 00:56:12,100
I would probably stop doing all this.
I would trade it in to own a basketball 

1195
00:56:12,100 --> 00:56:12,100
team.
I'm,

1196
00:56:12,100 --> 00:56:14,790
I'm not the principal owner.
And uh,

1197
00:56:15,150 --> 00:56:20,150
we got a great group,
but for me living in Atlanta as a 

1198
00:56:20,150 --> 00:56:23,421
basketball fan,
I was a season ticket holder for years 

1199
00:56:23,421 --> 00:56:23,421
first.

1200
00:56:23,421 --> 00:56:27,440
And then I was a consultant to the team.
So I got to fall in love with the 

1201
00:56:27,440 --> 00:56:31,111
players,
the coaching staff management first and 

1202
00:56:31,111 --> 00:56:33,130
now it'd be part of the ownership group 
with my wife and friends.

1203
00:56:33,610 --> 00:56:37,870
It's a in a city that I live in,
in a team that I love.

1204
00:56:38,200 --> 00:56:39,220
It's like,
you know,

1205
00:56:39,221 --> 00:56:41,050
it's just,
it's just unbelievable.

1206
00:56:41,580 --> 00:56:43,390
I was talking to my wife the other day,
I said,

1207
00:56:43,391 --> 00:56:48,391
you know,
from my father and my family and my 

1208
00:56:48,391 --> 00:56:51,181
friends and the city,
there's 80 plus games a year where I 

1209
00:56:51,181 --> 00:56:52,720
could put the tea nights a year.
I could put the TV on,

1210
00:56:53,430 --> 00:56:58,150
thinking about you as a knick fan,
multiply it by 20 and just,

1211
00:56:58,210 --> 00:56:58,960
you know,
as,

1212
00:56:59,040 --> 00:57:04,040
and just really love it.
So it's been super exciting and I think 

1213
00:57:04,040 --> 00:57:08,791
we've got a really bright future.
So I'm looking forward to the next 

1214
00:57:08,791 --> 00:57:08,791
couple of years.

1215
00:57:08,791 --> 00:57:10,050
I know it was a little before your time 
of owning the hawks,

1216
00:57:10,051 --> 00:57:12,120
but how is Dominique Wilkins not in the 
hall of fame?

1217
00:57:13,350 --> 00:57:15,880
I love Nick.
How's that kind of the whole thing?

1218
00:57:16,090 --> 00:57:19,150
He deserves to be.
He deserves to be.

1219
00:57:19,151 --> 00:57:22,600
He's a,
not only is he great basketball player,

1220
00:57:22,690 --> 00:57:24,910
but he's in Atlanta.
He's,

1221
00:57:24,970 --> 00:57:26,160
you know,
he's just a big part of the,

1222
00:57:26,260 --> 00:57:30,100
of the community.
So it's part of the state does the play,

1223
00:57:30,370 --> 00:57:31,330
but he's,
um,

1224
00:57:31,720 --> 00:57:36,720
he was at every game site.
I'd never seen him say no to a photo or 

1225
00:57:36,720 --> 00:57:39,550
an autograph ever.
Never just,

1226
00:57:39,551 --> 00:57:41,890
um,
he makes people feel really good.

1227
00:57:42,730 --> 00:57:44,110
And uh,
he's very approachable.

1228
00:57:44,280 --> 00:57:49,280
Yeah.
What are you guys doing over there to 

1229
00:57:49,280 --> 00:57:49,280
just

1230
00:57:49,280 --> 00:57:50,750
bring all of the things that you've 
talked about here into the game and make

1231
00:57:50,751 --> 00:57:55,100
it fun and add some of the other stuff 
that's not part of the 48 minutes?

1232
00:57:55,101 --> 00:57:55,970
Like,
you know,

1233
00:57:56,200 --> 00:57:57,260
the go New York go thing.

1234
00:57:57,360 --> 00:58:02,360
I think there's several buckets.
There's the internal bucket and Tony 

1235
00:58:02,360 --> 00:58:03,480
Wrestlers the principal on.
He's done an amazing job of just,

1236
00:58:03,510 --> 00:58:06,300
we have a new practice facility that 
state of the art best,

1237
00:58:06,330 --> 00:58:08,830
probably one of the best in the MBA.
Um,

1238
00:58:09,020 --> 00:58:11,190
we're renovating the arena.
Massive,

1239
00:58:11,520 --> 00:58:14,970
multi hundred million dollar renovation 
that's going on now.

1240
00:58:15,270 --> 00:58:20,270
So there's a whole,
there's the internal stuff and then 

1241
00:58:20,270 --> 00:58:20,820
there's the game presentation.
There's so many layers.

1242
00:58:21,180 --> 00:58:26,180
Game presentation.
There's the actual basketball side of 

1243
00:58:26,180 --> 00:58:26,850
it.
There's the nights that the,

1244
00:58:26,910 --> 00:58:31,910
that,
that the team doesn't play that the 

1245
00:58:31,910 --> 00:58:31,910
arena is available.
We have a concert,

1246
00:58:31,910 --> 00:58:33,030
I mean it's just,
there's so many layers of it,

1247
00:58:33,420 --> 00:58:38,420
but I think at the end of the day it's 
said that enthusiasm and passion and 

1248
00:58:38,420 --> 00:58:43,281
just bringing whatever you can to infuse
a culture of think of your emotional 

1249
00:58:43,291 --> 00:58:48,291
connection to the next and the first 
thing you said to me when I walked in 

1250
00:58:48,291 --> 00:58:50,160
and you took me to 94 games,
you remember those.

1251
00:58:50,161 --> 00:58:52,260
I remember where I was sitting for a 
certain games.

1252
00:58:52,261 --> 00:58:54,690
You know what you're eating and when he.
Five years ago,

1253
00:58:55,320 --> 00:58:57,500
I don't remember what I ate last week.
Right?

1254
00:58:57,590 --> 00:59:02,590
You have no idea.
There's just so much emotion and if we 

1255
00:59:02,590 --> 00:59:06,561
could bring that same passion to the 
community and marry that with the 

1256
00:59:10,530 --> 00:59:15,530
Atlanta Hawks,
that's gonna be super powerful and I 

1257
00:59:15,530 --> 00:59:15,530
think we can run annoying

1258
00:59:15,530 --> 00:59:19,940
man.
It's pretty clear you're bringing that 

1259
00:59:19,940 --> 00:59:19,940
to your life everyday because this was 
just.

1260
00:59:19,940 --> 00:59:20,950
I mean this flew by and it's like I 
could feel it done.

1261
00:59:21,230 --> 00:59:22,160
That's it.
That's it.

1262
00:59:22,220 --> 00:59:23,630
Well,
you got to go do Rogan now,

1263
00:59:23,631 --> 00:59:28,631
so I don't want to.
I don't want to steal all your brain 

1264
00:59:28,631 --> 00:59:28,631
power.
You got three more hours with Rogan.

1265
00:59:28,631 --> 00:59:33,611
I sense you're going to be up to it to 
the channel and you don't even drink 

1266
00:59:33,611 --> 00:59:34,370
caffeine.
You're just hopped up on coconut water.

1267
00:59:34,460 --> 00:59:36,870
I am potassium down.
Protect.

1268
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:38,660
You don't even need bananas anymore.
Do you have any.

1269
00:59:38,810 --> 00:59:42,020
Why would he have been at this point?
I eat a lot of bananas.

1270
00:59:42,100 --> 00:59:43,560
You eat the bananas.
Well,

1271
00:59:43,580 --> 00:59:44,210
listen man,
it's been,

1272
00:59:44,220 --> 00:59:49,220
it's been an absolute pleasure.
I suspect we will cross paths again 

1273
00:59:49,220 --> 00:59:50,030
perhaps in Atlanta because even though 
we're holding this for a little bit,

1274
00:59:50,080 --> 00:59:51,860
uh,
may come watch you.

1275
00:59:51,910 --> 00:59:56,910
All right,
we're going to come to the Peterson 

1276
00:59:56,910 --> 00:59:56,910
event in Atlanta.
Awesome.

1277
00:59:56,910 --> 00:59:56,910
Uh,
