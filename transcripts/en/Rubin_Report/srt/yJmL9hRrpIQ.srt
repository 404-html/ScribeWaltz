1
00:00:05,130 --> 00:00:05,963
There's an idea out there that 97% of 
climate scientists agree that manmade 

2
00:00:09,661 --> 00:00:12,810
climate change is real.
I did a little digging on this.

3
00:00:12,811 --> 00:00:15,150
97% and surprise,
surprise,

4
00:00:15,151 --> 00:00:18,990
depending on what websites you go to and
what sources you trust.

5
00:00:18,991 --> 00:00:23,430
The answer actually isn't so clear.
What is clear for sure,

6
00:00:23,431 --> 00:00:24,264
however,
is that the overwhelming amount of 

7
00:00:25,921 --> 00:00:26,754
climate scientists,
the very experts in this field do agree 

8
00:00:30,301 --> 00:00:31,134
that the climate is changing and it has 
something to do with what humans are 

9
00:00:34,351 --> 00:00:35,184
putting into our atmosphere.
Whether or not the exact number is 

10
00:00:38,041 --> 00:00:43,041
really 97% or 86% or 75% is largely 
irrelevant.

11
00:00:43,890 --> 00:00:44,723
The point is that the vast amount of 
people who study this for a living 

12
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:48,833
believe it to be true.
We haven't discussed a ton on climate 

13
00:00:51,811 --> 00:00:53,700
change since we've started the Rubin 
report,

14
00:00:53,701 --> 00:00:57,870
but I've said several times on the show 
that since I'm not a scientist,

15
00:00:57,871 --> 00:01:00,810
I have to go on what the majority of 
scientists say.

16
00:01:01,050 --> 00:01:04,420
Thus I accept man made climate change as
fat.

17
00:01:04,830 --> 00:01:08,160
I'm basing my belief on the best 
information that I have in front of me.

18
00:01:08,161 --> 00:01:11,760
You don't just get to pick and choose.
When you believe in science,

19
00:01:11,940 --> 00:01:16,940
it either is fact or it is not.
So if the vast amount of scientists that

20
00:01:17,611 --> 00:01:21,510
are professionals in this industry 
believe something to be true,

21
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:22,553
then I have to base my opinion on that 
rather than just guessing or hoping or 

22
00:01:26,311 --> 00:01:30,750
picking the random scientists that see 
the world the way I want it to be.

23
00:01:31,260 --> 00:01:32,093
At the same time,
we should always be skeptical of who 

24
00:01:34,651 --> 00:01:35,484
funds what scientific study,
if there are political aims behind the 

25
00:01:38,791 --> 00:01:39,624
research,
and especially if there's money to be 

26
00:01:41,101 --> 00:01:45,720
made by claiming something as fact when 
the truth remains more elusive.

27
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:46,913
A simple example of this of course,
is that if a tobacco company funded 

28
00:01:49,441 --> 00:01:50,274
studies on smoking and human health,
we'd all be a bit more leery of it then 

29
00:01:53,821 --> 00:01:58,380
a truly independent study done for a 
purely research purposes.

30
00:01:58,860 --> 00:01:59,693
So with all this in mind,
I do believe from all the people I've 

31
00:02:02,281 --> 00:02:04,410
talked to,
such as Dr.

32
00:02:04,410 --> 00:02:05,243
Michael Mann,
the creator of the hockey stick theory 

33
00:02:06,510 --> 00:02:09,240
or my own science guru,
Cara Santa Maria,

34
00:02:09,510 --> 00:02:11,670
as well as the information in front of 
me,

35
00:02:11,970 --> 00:02:12,803
that manmade climate change is real.
I also believe that the national 

36
00:02:16,111 --> 00:02:19,830
conversation around climate change is 
mostly idiotic,

37
00:02:19,831 --> 00:02:20,664
usually vacillating between people who 
think we're on the brink of a 

38
00:02:23,191 --> 00:02:28,191
catastrophic climactic disaster and 
those who hide their head in the sand to

39
00:02:28,471 --> 00:02:30,630
the realities of the changing 
environment.

40
00:02:30,990 --> 00:02:33,390
Like most things,
and I always say this right,

41
00:02:33,391 --> 00:02:34,224
the answer is probably somewhere in 
between and that's where we have to 

42
00:02:37,681 --> 00:02:40,500
start having these important 
conversations.

43
00:02:40,700 --> 00:02:44,430
And my guest this week is the president 
for the Center for Industrial Progress,

44
00:02:44,431 --> 00:02:47,280
Alex Epstein.
The center is a nonprofit think tank,

45
00:02:47,281 --> 00:02:51,930
which believes in creating a new 
industrial revolution through technology

46
00:02:51,931 --> 00:02:54,480
to improve the planet.
Alex's book,

47
00:02:54,481 --> 00:02:55,314
the moral case for fossil fuels lays out
the argument that fossil fuels have not 

48
00:03:00,161 --> 00:03:00,994
only been an incredibly positive and 
important piece for the advancement of 

49
00:03:04,451 --> 00:03:05,284
mankind,
but even now in 2016 they are still the 

50
00:03:08,171 --> 00:03:12,550
best source of energy for humans to make
the most of this world.

51
00:03:12,850 --> 00:03:17,850
His book also tackles many of the myths 
surrounding fossil fuels and even has me

52
00:03:18,041 --> 00:03:18,874
challenging many of my own assumptions 
of how much fossil fuels are truly 

53
00:03:21,881 --> 00:03:25,630
affecting the environment and if we've 
demonized in energy source,

54
00:03:25,631 --> 00:03:28,840
that still is a lot of great potential 
to help mankind.

55
00:03:29,410 --> 00:03:30,243
Now,
before I continue and before people 

56
00:03:31,361 --> 00:03:32,950
start freaking out,
let me stop.

57
00:03:32,951 --> 00:03:36,250
Those of you who are going to say I 
Ruben's a climate change denier for even

58
00:03:36,251 --> 00:03:37,990
talking to this guy.
No,

59
00:03:37,991 --> 00:03:38,824
that really is not the case,
but who I am is someone who is willing 

60
00:03:42,071 --> 00:03:45,940
to have the provocative and complex 
conversation that surrounds it.

61
00:03:46,810 --> 00:03:47,643
You guys know that I've made this show 
about the battle of ideas and Alex is 

62
00:03:50,501 --> 00:03:55,240
ideas are considered basically heretical
in some elite circles.

63
00:03:55,241 --> 00:03:56,074
He's had a public spat with Al Gore and 
he's been subpoenaed in a lawsuit that 

64
00:04:00,041 --> 00:04:03,310
the Justice Department has brought 
against Exxon Mobile.

65
00:04:03,340 --> 00:04:08,200
Even though he himself has done nothing 
wrong other than share his ideas.

66
00:04:08,410 --> 00:04:09,243
In a truly free society,
we must allow all ideas to flourish 

67
00:04:12,371 --> 00:04:14,740
because sunlight is the best 
disinfectant.

68
00:04:15,010 --> 00:04:16,840
If Alex is,
ideas are bad,

69
00:04:16,841 --> 00:04:17,674
the only way we can truly refute them is
by proving them to be so not by banning 

70
00:04:22,661 --> 00:04:25,870
the discussion altogether.
This is why the twitter band,

71
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:28,990
Milo Yiannopoulos a couple weeks ago was
so awful,

72
00:04:29,020 --> 00:04:31,780
even if it was within twitter is right 
to do so.

73
00:04:32,050 --> 00:04:36,730
Surely Milo's ideas weren't the worst of
all the ideas on twitter,

74
00:04:36,940 --> 00:04:39,790
but he had gained influence that they 
couldn't control,

75
00:04:39,940 --> 00:04:40,773
so they shut him down.
While Nazi sympathizers in Isis 

76
00:04:43,001 --> 00:04:46,690
supporters remained there freely.
You think Milo's ideas are bad?

77
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:49,510
Yeah.
Well then use your voice on social media

78
00:04:49,511 --> 00:04:52,480
to call him out on it.
You think Alex is ideas are bad.

79
00:04:52,481 --> 00:04:53,314
Well then write a book refuting them.
The risk we face is that banning those 

80
00:04:57,491 --> 00:04:58,324
who we disagree with and suing,
those who say saying we don't like will 

81
00:05:01,631 --> 00:05:02,464
eventually become the norm.
This is why I think the new battle in 

82
00:05:05,291 --> 00:05:09,370
front of us is about authoritarians 
versus libertarians.

83
00:05:09,371 --> 00:05:10,204
People who want to tell you how to think
versus people who want you to think on 

84
00:05:14,171 --> 00:05:15,004
your own.
I think you guys know which side I'm on 

85
00:05:17,441 --> 00:05:20,140
and if you're listening to this,
I think you're right there with me.

86
00:05:25,330 --> 00:05:29,760
My guest this week is an activist and 
author and president and founder of this

87
00:05:29,761 --> 00:05:33,130
center for industrial progress.
Alex Epstein,

88
00:05:33,131 --> 00:05:34,070
welcome to the show.
Hi.

89
00:05:34,071 --> 00:05:34,904
Good to be here.
Now I have a feeling that I'm going to 

90
00:05:36,881 --> 00:05:37,714
be in a lot of trouble just for having 
this book on the table just for putting 

91
00:05:41,471 --> 00:05:44,080
this book that you've written right in 
between us.

92
00:05:44,081 --> 00:05:45,730
People are going to be angry right off 
the bat.

93
00:05:46,780 --> 00:05:48,070
They're going to be,
by the end of this interview,

94
00:05:48,071 --> 00:05:49,630
they'll be converts.
Yeah.

95
00:05:49,650 --> 00:05:50,483
Who are going to convert people.
They'll see the method of thinking just 

96
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:54,700
just makes so much sense.
Yeah.

97
00:05:54,730 --> 00:05:56,800
All right,
well I'm glad that we're starting with,

98
00:05:57,290 --> 00:05:58,123
uh,
that little piece of information right 

99
00:05:59,481 --> 00:06:00,314
there because first off,
a lot of people have recommended that I 

100
00:06:02,241 --> 00:06:03,074
have you on the show people that like 
you and people that don't like you just 

101
00:06:05,361 --> 00:06:06,194
because we do conversation here.
So I've said before that my policy on 

102
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:13,220
climate change is basically,
I'm not a scientist,

103
00:06:13,221 --> 00:06:14,054
so I have to sort of believe what the 
scientists tell me what the majority of 

104
00:06:17,511 --> 00:06:18,344
scientists tell me.
I mentioned that to you before in the 

105
00:06:19,881 --> 00:06:23,510
green room for a second and uh,
you weren't sold on that concept.

106
00:06:23,511 --> 00:06:24,260
Really?

107
00:06:24,260 --> 00:06:25,150
Yeah,
it has.

108
00:06:25,151 --> 00:06:27,110
Traction is really bizarre.
So let's,

109
00:06:27,170 --> 00:06:28,003
let's apply that to eugenics.
So let's say we're in the early 19 

110
00:06:30,141 --> 00:06:30,974
hundreds,
you have a lot of public declared 

111
00:06:32,691 --> 00:06:35,990
scientific consensus that the gene pool 
is being diluted.

112
00:06:35,991 --> 00:06:39,710
That we need to sterilize people.
That there's what I call global domain,

113
00:06:39,711 --> 00:06:41,510
right?
Because all the dumb people are sleeping

114
00:06:41,511 --> 00:06:45,110
with each other and procreating and it's
this societal catastrophe.

115
00:06:45,111 --> 00:06:45,944
The gene pool is going to degrade.
And so we need the inferiors to stop 

116
00:06:49,071 --> 00:06:50,780
procreating.
We need to sterilize them more.

117
00:06:50,781 --> 00:06:51,614
On the case of Europe,
we need to do much more dramatically 

118
00:06:53,661 --> 00:06:54,494
negative things to them.
So you see these scientific consensus 

119
00:06:56,451 --> 00:06:58,030
and you say,
oh well I had,

120
00:06:58,130 --> 00:06:59,540
I'm not a scientist,
I got a,

121
00:06:59,570 --> 00:07:00,980
I shouldn't obey.
So what's,

122
00:07:01,550 --> 00:07:03,380
why wouldn't you do that or would you,

123
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:06,060
uh,
well it's very clear to me that uh,

124
00:07:06,190 --> 00:07:07,023
we have dumbed down things significantly
cause I'm pretty sure we're going 

125
00:07:08,590 --> 00:07:10,640
idiocracy at this point.
Um,

126
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:11,520
but,
uh,

127
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:13,210
but all right,
so we didn't sterilize enough.

128
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:14,060
No.
So no one,

129
00:07:14,060 --> 00:07:15,160
I'm gonna get into that trouble for 
that.

130
00:07:15,161 --> 00:07:16,780
So No,
I see your point.

131
00:07:16,810 --> 00:07:18,280
And,
and that's what we're going to do here.

132
00:07:18,281 --> 00:07:18,671
So,
okay.

133
00:07:18,671 --> 00:07:22,270
So first off the book is called the 
moral case for fossil fuels.

134
00:07:22,630 --> 00:07:23,463
So let's do a little fossil fuel 101 
because I was watching a couple of your 

135
00:07:26,531 --> 00:07:27,364
videos on youtube and you got a great 
video where you're standing in New York 

136
00:07:29,381 --> 00:07:30,214
City and all of these,
I guess green activists are walking 

137
00:07:33,340 --> 00:07:35,740
through and you have a sign and it says,
I love fossil fuels.

138
00:07:35,890 --> 00:07:38,200
And they're just yelling slogans at you.
Yeah.

139
00:07:38,290 --> 00:07:39,910
Forgetting who's right or wrong for a 
second,

140
00:07:39,911 --> 00:07:42,910
like they're just yelling things.
And I think part of what you were trying

141
00:07:42,911 --> 00:07:45,610
to show them was that they didn't even 
know what they were saying really.

142
00:07:45,730 --> 00:07:47,980
So I thought if we just define some 
terms to start,

143
00:07:47,981 --> 00:07:50,830
that would be good.
So what are fossil fuels?

144
00:07:51,060 --> 00:07:52,350
Yes.
I think if you had asked them,

145
00:07:52,351 --> 00:07:55,620
and I do this in universities,
often I'll do a poll and I'll say,

146
00:07:55,830 --> 00:07:56,663
okay,
who here believes that fossil fuels are 

147
00:07:57,781 --> 00:07:58,614
an unnecessary evil?
Which means we can get rid of them 

148
00:08:00,691 --> 00:08:02,490
quickly and we should,
you know,

149
00:08:02,491 --> 00:08:04,080
there this addiction,
we need to get rid of them quickly,

150
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:05,550
right?
Half the room will raise your hands.

151
00:08:05,551 --> 00:08:06,061
And I say,
okay,

152
00:08:06,061 --> 00:08:07,890
who believes that they're a necessary 
evil?

153
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:09,210
That is,
they're really bad.

154
00:08:09,211 --> 00:08:10,770
But we're stuck with them for some 
amount of time.

155
00:08:10,771 --> 00:08:12,420
The other half raised their hand and I 
say,

156
00:08:12,421 --> 00:08:15,960
who believes they're a superior good.
Like we use them because overall they're

157
00:08:15,961 --> 00:08:16,794
the best for human life.
And I raised my hand and if anyone's 

158
00:08:17,851 --> 00:08:19,630
read my book,
they raised their hand wrong,

159
00:08:20,340 --> 00:08:21,540
or at least some of them do.
Right?

160
00:08:21,570 --> 00:08:22,410
And then I say,
okay,

161
00:08:22,411 --> 00:08:23,700
great,
I've got a harder question.

162
00:08:23,970 --> 00:08:25,920
Who here can tell me what fossil fuels 
are?

163
00:08:26,790 --> 00:08:27,500
Nobody raises

164
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:28,333
Saturday.

165
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:30,290
And so,
but it's a good lesson.

166
00:08:30,291 --> 00:08:33,830
And people actually take the lesson 
despite being a quote idiocracy and this

167
00:08:33,831 --> 00:08:34,664
isn't very high level schools.
This isn't like a poker tele attack or 

168
00:08:37,191 --> 00:08:38,600
whatever.
They might even know more.

169
00:08:38,601 --> 00:08:39,434
But I remember doing it this at 
Wellesley and I think the video is 

170
00:08:41,031 --> 00:08:44,480
online and you can see and,
and I make the point well,

171
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:45,513
shouldn't,
isn't a precondition of having an 

172
00:08:46,581 --> 00:08:47,414
opinion of whether something is good or 
bad isn't a precondition that we know 

173
00:08:49,971 --> 00:08:50,840
what it is.
Right.

174
00:08:50,870 --> 00:08:53,210
So I appreciate the questions.
Yeah.

175
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:55,380
So the way,
I mean,

176
00:08:55,381 --> 00:08:56,780
I can tell you how I like to define

177
00:08:56,870 --> 00:08:58,410
oh yeah.
Well I think most people,

178
00:08:58,411 --> 00:08:59,244
I think when they think fossil fuels,
I pictured that little cartoon in 

179
00:09:01,771 --> 00:09:04,260
Jurassic Park when they're explaining 
how they got the,

180
00:09:04,270 --> 00:09:06,600
the dinosaur DNA,
but they're showing you,

181
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:08,730
you know,
dinosaur decomposing sort of,

182
00:09:08,731 --> 00:09:10,970
and then suddenly it turned to oil and 
that we pull that away.

183
00:09:10,971 --> 00:09:11,804
Like,
that's I think what most people in the 

184
00:09:13,381 --> 00:09:16,230
most simplistic way,
it's think it's something like that,

185
00:09:16,231 --> 00:09:17,064
but I'm going to let you run

186
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:20,230
a little bit more.
They just think it's just,

187
00:09:20,290 --> 00:09:23,860
just filth.
It's just like dirt and fill,

188
00:09:23,861 --> 00:09:24,694
finish.
Just you have this dirty thing and then 

189
00:09:25,811 --> 00:09:26,644
you just blow it into smoke and everyone
and everything looks like China and we 

190
00:09:29,681 --> 00:09:31,230
really need to stop using it.
Right.

191
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:32,940
That's pretty much the visual.
Okay.

192
00:09:32,980 --> 00:09:34,440
Um,
now tell me what it really,

193
00:09:35,260 --> 00:09:36,400
I,
I put it this way.

194
00:09:36,610 --> 00:09:40,570
Fossil fuels are a hoe and I'll,
I'll break this down,

195
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:45,430
but it's a high energy hydrocarbon 
derived from ancient life.

196
00:09:45,790 --> 00:09:46,623
Hey,
so it's a high energy hydrocarbon 

197
00:09:47,531 --> 00:09:48,364
derived from ancient life.
So hydrocarbon is one of the key 

198
00:09:51,461 --> 00:09:52,294
concepts.
So it's a combination primarily of 

199
00:09:53,501 --> 00:09:56,020
hydrogen and carbon atoms.
And we,

200
00:09:56,170 --> 00:09:58,720
you can probably guess this from the 
whole co2 controversy.

201
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:01,230
Basically you have different kinds of 
this.

202
00:10:01,231 --> 00:10:02,064
So you have natural gas,
which has a high ratio of hydrogen to 

203
00:10:03,941 --> 00:10:04,360
carbon.

204
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:06,670
That's why when you burn it and it 
missed the Lisio too,

205
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:10,300
and then Cole has the highest ratio of 
carbon to hydrogen.

206
00:10:10,450 --> 00:10:12,730
That's why it emits the most CO2 when 
you burn it,

207
00:10:12,731 --> 00:10:15,760
to burn something as to oxidize it,
to combine it with oxygen.

208
00:10:15,761 --> 00:10:16,594
So whenever you burn a hydrocarbon,
you get h two o and c o two plus 

209
00:10:20,411 --> 00:10:22,900
whatever else is attached to the 
hydrocarbon.

210
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:26,200
It turns out that this chemical 
structure stores in enormous,

211
00:10:26,230 --> 00:10:28,870
enormous amount of energy.
And it also,

212
00:10:28,930 --> 00:10:29,763
and also turns out that the ancient 
plant life or ancient life that this 

213
00:10:32,561 --> 00:10:34,240
comes from,
it's different kinds of life.

214
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:35,553
It turns out there was so much of that 
that we have almost unfathomable amount 

215
00:10:39,271 --> 00:10:40,610
of the stuff.
So I,

216
00:10:40,900 --> 00:10:41,733
my best estimates that I've seen are 
really dozens more than we've used in 

217
00:10:44,171 --> 00:10:45,970
the entire history of industrial 
civilization.

218
00:10:46,270 --> 00:10:48,610
So with this gives us,
from an energy perspective,

219
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:52,870
is an extremely concentrated in 
plentiful source of energy that starting

220
00:10:52,871 --> 00:10:55,870
about 300 years ago,
we developed the technology to harness.

221
00:10:55,871 --> 00:10:58,630
Before that it was useless.
But once we developed the steam engine,

222
00:10:58,840 --> 00:11:01,390
the internal combustion engine oil 
refining,

223
00:11:01,391 --> 00:11:02,224
modern natural gas technology,
this became by far the dominant method 

224
00:11:05,261 --> 00:11:06,970
of producing energy around the world.

225
00:11:07,110 --> 00:11:08,330
All right,
so let's pause there for a second.

226
00:11:08,331 --> 00:11:10,580
So basically this,
this former life.

227
00:11:10,581 --> 00:11:12,200
So its former plant life,
animal life,

228
00:11:12,201 --> 00:11:13,270
it's all the stuff they did.

229
00:11:13,450 --> 00:11:14,283
Yeah.
Like playing on or it's familiar 

230
00:11:15,170 --> 00:11:16,740
divisions like coal.
It has,

231
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:18,830
you know,
coal is more sort of terrestrial,

232
00:11:18,860 --> 00:11:20,750
other things are more underwater,
but it's an,

233
00:11:21,090 --> 00:11:24,720
I mean technically it doesn't strictly 
need to be from life.

234
00:11:24,721 --> 00:11:28,200
And there are many theories that some of
it at least isn't it take like Saturn,

235
00:11:28,201 --> 00:11:28,680
right.
Sat,

236
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:31,830
Saturn's rings are made of natural gas,
they're made of method.

237
00:11:31,890 --> 00:11:35,160
So it's something that occurs in a non 
biological form.

238
00:11:35,370 --> 00:11:36,203
But for many reasons we think most of it
is biological and that has some 

239
00:11:38,971 --> 00:11:41,300
implications for how long it lasts.
Right.

240
00:11:41,340 --> 00:11:42,121
Over time.
But,

241
00:11:42,121 --> 00:11:42,954
but the,
the idea that we're running out of it 

242
00:11:44,731 --> 00:11:46,800
quickly has gone out of fashion,
uh,

243
00:11:46,801 --> 00:11:47,634
recently,
just because we keep discovering new 

244
00:11:49,650 --> 00:11:50,700
technology.
So the,

245
00:11:50,910 --> 00:11:51,743
the base amount of the material 
underground is staggering and it might 

246
00:11:54,671 --> 00:11:56,680
be far more staggering than we think.

247
00:11:56,760 --> 00:11:57,990
Yeah,
I guess I never thought of that.

248
00:11:57,991 --> 00:12:00,180
So specifically because I feel like 
years ago,

249
00:12:00,181 --> 00:12:02,430
maybe 10 years ago,
people were always saying,

250
00:12:02,431 --> 00:12:03,420
well,
we're going to run out of this,

251
00:12:03,421 --> 00:12:04,530
we're going to run out of this,
right?

252
00:12:04,590 --> 00:12:07,260
But now it seems like we're finding gas 
fields all over the place,

253
00:12:07,261 --> 00:12:09,450
aren't they?
Finding crazy new gas fields in the,

254
00:12:09,451 --> 00:12:12,720
in the Mediterranean right now and all 
over the Middle East.

255
00:12:12,721 --> 00:12:14,430
Isn't that happening right now as we 
speak?

256
00:12:14,550 --> 00:12:15,960
Two,
two things that can happen.

257
00:12:15,961 --> 00:12:19,170
One is you can find a stock of more raw 
material,

258
00:12:19,230 --> 00:12:20,063
which is always happening.
But the other and often more 

259
00:12:21,751 --> 00:12:22,584
consequential is that you can find a way
to use existing raw material that was 

260
00:12:25,831 --> 00:12:29,100
previously unusable.
So the whole shale energy revolution,

261
00:12:29,101 --> 00:12:32,940
which people over simplify as fracking,
that's an example of that.

262
00:12:32,941 --> 00:12:34,740
That's where you have,
uh,

263
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:36,720
this,
this material called shale,

264
00:12:36,900 --> 00:12:37,733
which had oil and gas in it,
but it was locked in too tightly to get 

265
00:12:40,231 --> 00:12:41,064
out.
You have this modern combination of 

266
00:12:42,631 --> 00:12:45,840
technologies that unlocked it.
And just as an example in the book,

267
00:12:45,841 --> 00:12:46,680
Atlas shrugged,
which has,

268
00:12:46,681 --> 00:12:47,940
is,
is my favorite book.

269
00:12:48,050 --> 00:12:48,660
Yeah.
Uh,

270
00:12:48,660 --> 00:12:49,710
one of the heroes,
Ellis,

271
00:12:49,711 --> 00:12:50,544
why discovers a method for getting oil 
out of shale and 50 years later this 

272
00:12:55,231 --> 00:12:56,180
actually happened,

273
00:12:56,300 --> 00:12:57,133
right?
What we're going to get to some 

274
00:12:57,411 --> 00:12:59,390
objective as him and I and ran.
But that must have been

275
00:12:59,510 --> 00:13:01,580
particularly that particularly rewarding
for you,

276
00:13:01,610 --> 00:13:05,710
but that show that just shows how we 
know often know of the raw material,

277
00:13:05,711 --> 00:13:09,220
but we can't make it a resource until we
have sufficient human ingenuity.

278
00:13:09,300 --> 00:13:10,650
Right.
Uh,

279
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:11,513
now fracking,
I want to talk about it a little bit 

280
00:13:13,171 --> 00:13:14,760
quick and then we'll get back to this.
So fracking,

281
00:13:14,761 --> 00:13:16,230
whenever someone says fracking for 
stuff,

282
00:13:16,231 --> 00:13:18,560
I think of Battlestar Galactica,
but then I think of,

283
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:19,740
uh,
Mr.

284
00:13:19,740 --> 00:13:22,410
Burns slant oil drilling.
Do you ever see that simpsons when he,

285
00:13:22,411 --> 00:13:25,500
uh,
does the slant oil drilling too,

286
00:13:25,530 --> 00:13:26,363
because he creates a,
an oil refinery over here and it's 

287
00:13:28,441 --> 00:13:29,274
slanted so that he can do things and it 
ends up going under at school and all 

288
00:13:31,531 --> 00:13:32,580
that.
It's the who shot Mr.

289
00:13:32,580 --> 00:13:33,300
Burns episodes.
Great.

290
00:13:33,300 --> 00:13:33,660
Great.
Yep.

291
00:13:33,660 --> 00:13:35,050
There's another one after a while,
not just news.

292
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:36,400
Yeah,
exactly.

293
00:13:36,401 --> 00:13:37,240
So they did go.
Yeah.

294
00:13:37,241 --> 00:13:38,074
Oh,
so then you couldn't be happy with that 

295
00:13:38,681 --> 00:13:39,514
at all.
You probably really don't like Lisa 

296
00:13:40,780 --> 00:13:41,613
Symptom.
I would say yes.

297
00:13:41,630 --> 00:13:43,970
She's probably not.
I already know the simpsons came out.

298
00:13:43,971 --> 00:13:45,760
I was the exact same age as bark.
Yes.

299
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:49,700
I'm born in 1980 and it came out in 89 
he was nine and I was nine.

300
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:53,720
And since I've outgrown him,
but at least I never,

301
00:13:53,721 --> 00:13:57,800
I never liked even even when I was a 
liberal kind of politically as a kid.

302
00:13:57,880 --> 00:13:59,480
Yeah,
never forget Mr.

303
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:00,410
Burns.
How do you feel about those two words?

304
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:03,530
But he was never likable.
He was very funny.

305
00:14:03,580 --> 00:14:04,413
Yeah.
So you're not forward the three eyed 

306
00:14:04,971 --> 00:14:05,870
fish,
you'd say.

307
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:07,220
Well that's a whole,
so,

308
00:14:07,221 --> 00:14:08,860
and that's a whole interesting 
distortion,

309
00:14:08,861 --> 00:14:11,370
which I think reveals that the modern 
environment,

310
00:14:11,380 --> 00:14:12,850
what they call the environmental 
movement,

311
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:16,240
which I would call the anti human or 
regressive movement,

312
00:14:16,540 --> 00:14:20,920
is really an equal opportunity destroyer
and attack of every practice practo form

313
00:14:20,921 --> 00:14:21,754
of energy because there is no manmade co
two issue with nuclear and yet they 

314
00:14:24,671 --> 00:14:25,504
viciously attack it,
which I think just shows that they'll 

315
00:14:27,401 --> 00:14:30,340
find a reason to attack any form of 
energy that actually works,

316
00:14:30,341 --> 00:14:31,174
but right,
right.

317
00:14:31,430 --> 00:14:32,031
That's okay.
Yeah.

318
00:14:32,031 --> 00:14:33,620
So let's pause on that.
So fracking,

319
00:14:33,621 --> 00:14:34,454
so I feel like people have no idea what 
fracking is and I did obviously some 

320
00:14:37,581 --> 00:14:39,590
research before I sat down with you and 
you don't,

321
00:14:39,591 --> 00:14:40,424
you see all these videos of people 
turning on water and water burst into 

322
00:14:42,321 --> 00:14:44,060
flames.
Generally that's,

323
00:14:44,270 --> 00:14:46,970
I would think that that's not so great.
So sell me on fracking.

324
00:14:48,270 --> 00:14:49,103
Okay.
Isn't that kind of like a funny way of 

325
00:14:50,721 --> 00:14:51,554
approaching like there are some pictures
of people in the water bursting on 

326
00:14:55,020 --> 00:14:56,360
plans,
like an odd thing.

327
00:14:56,361 --> 00:14:59,000
Water racking into supplier is bad.
I mean,

328
00:14:59,001 --> 00:15:01,970
this kind of goes with the issue of like
when you hear climate change,

329
00:15:01,971 --> 00:15:02,804
you just sort of asked the scientists 
what they think with everything we need 

330
00:15:05,241 --> 00:15:08,450
to look at at the full context of the 
technology,

331
00:15:08,451 --> 00:15:09,284
both Kay and very carefully,
both at its potential positives and its 

332
00:15:12,141 --> 00:15:12,974
potential negatives.
So even if someone could show me that 

333
00:15:15,711 --> 00:15:19,010
fracking is leading to a lot more 
people's faucets on water,

334
00:15:19,011 --> 00:15:20,450
which is completely bizarre,
but,

335
00:15:20,690 --> 00:15:22,100
uh,
even if that were true,

336
00:15:22,101 --> 00:15:24,740
I would want to know the whole context 
of what's the benefit of this.

337
00:15:24,741 --> 00:15:25,574
So for example,
oil and gas or the two fundamentals are 

338
00:15:28,521 --> 00:15:30,890
two of three fundamentals of modern 
agriculture.

339
00:15:31,150 --> 00:15:33,730
Uh,
oil is the only thing that powers modern

340
00:15:33,820 --> 00:15:36,470
agricultural machinery,
primarily the form of diesel.

341
00:15:36,710 --> 00:15:37,543
So there's,
there's just no fuel that has that kind 

342
00:15:38,781 --> 00:15:39,614
of versatility,
that kind of portability and natural 

343
00:15:41,331 --> 00:15:42,050
gas,
uh,

344
00:15:42,050 --> 00:15:42,883
makes modern fertilizer.
So billions of people's lives depend on 

345
00:15:45,381 --> 00:15:46,214
that.
So fracking or more accurately shale 

346
00:15:47,931 --> 00:15:48,764
energy technology that's enabling 
billions of people to live who would 

347
00:15:51,561 --> 00:15:54,110
otherwise starve.
So in my moral philosophy,

348
00:15:54,111 --> 00:15:56,780
I take that into account.
When I think of something,

349
00:15:56,781 --> 00:15:57,614
I don't just look for the negative.
So the principle is we need to look at 

350
00:16:00,021 --> 00:16:04,100
the full context and often attackers 
just look at the negative context.

351
00:16:04,250 --> 00:16:06,590
Now you do need to look at the negative 
part of the context.

352
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:09,170
And when you investigate that,
I mean what you just find,

353
00:16:09,171 --> 00:16:10,004
which anyone who studies water knows is 
that the number one contaminant of 

354
00:16:13,791 --> 00:16:15,440
water,
including with methane,

355
00:16:15,441 --> 00:16:17,240
which is natural gas,
is mother nature.

356
00:16:17,570 --> 00:16:19,280
So if you look at the US Geological 
Survey,

357
00:16:19,281 --> 00:16:24,281
something like 20% of just regular water
wells are naturally contaminated.

358
00:16:24,321 --> 00:16:25,154
So this is why for for centuries you 
have records of people lighting their 

359
00:16:28,161 --> 00:16:28,994
water on fire.
So one thing that gasoline brought to 

360
00:16:30,591 --> 00:16:34,340
the fore is because Josh Fox was against
natural gas,

361
00:16:34,820 --> 00:16:35,653
and that that brought a premium to 
anyone who could show natural gas in 

362
00:16:38,901 --> 00:16:39,734
their water and blame it on fracking.
But that doesn't mean that there was 

363
00:16:42,741 --> 00:16:43,401
causation.
Now,

364
00:16:43,401 --> 00:16:44,234
theoretically there could be,
but it's very rare and it's very much a 

365
00:16:46,641 --> 00:16:47,650
solvable problem.
Meaning,

366
00:16:47,670 --> 00:16:48,503
if I turn on my water,
I'm right now in San Francisco and it 

367
00:16:50,151 --> 00:16:52,770
like lights on fire and it's not like 
the end of the year,

368
00:16:52,810 --> 00:16:54,440
it's not even a lights on fire,
right?

369
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:58,110
If I strike a match to it,
it lights on fire.

370
00:16:58,340 --> 00:17:00,540
So it's not that flame is coming out of 
the farm,

371
00:17:01,150 --> 00:17:01,983
the whole,
you know,

372
00:17:02,300 --> 00:17:04,670
the building burned down or there's 
nothing like this.

373
00:17:04,670 --> 00:17:08,340
So you have to have a very proactive,
uh,

374
00:17:08,750 --> 00:17:09,583
attitude where you want the technologies
to be as good as possible in one 

375
00:17:12,681 --> 00:17:13,514
conspicuous attribute of the anti humans
is they always want the technologies 

376
00:17:16,791 --> 00:17:18,530
there against,
to be bad like that,

377
00:17:18,531 --> 00:17:23,531
you really feel viscerally that they 
want a catastrophic climate change to be

378
00:17:23,601 --> 00:17:23,911
true.
And,

379
00:17:23,911 --> 00:17:26,690
and I ask this question on twitter,
nobody has ever contradicted me.

380
00:17:26,840 --> 00:17:27,673
How many catastrophists do you know who 
would be happy if they found out they 

381
00:17:30,531 --> 00:17:32,150
were wrong?
Because they're gleeful.

382
00:17:32,151 --> 00:17:32,984
Every storm and every,
every bad weather event that they 

383
00:17:34,671 --> 00:17:37,820
attribute to co2 and you know,
suv and that kind of thing.

384
00:17:37,940 --> 00:17:40,060
There's a real glee.
Whereas I would,

385
00:17:40,070 --> 00:17:42,380
and sometimes I'll tell them like a 
counter fact,

386
00:17:42,381 --> 00:17:42,651
like,
Hey,

387
00:17:42,651 --> 00:17:43,484
you know that actually the rate of 
people dying from climate is going way 

388
00:17:45,891 --> 00:17:47,180
down.
We're actually way safer.

389
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:49,470
And they immediately scream at me.
I said,

390
00:17:49,471 --> 00:17:51,450
wait a second,
shouldn't you be happy at this?

391
00:17:51,510 --> 00:17:54,240
That there's a possibility,
but they're not happy people in general,

392
00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:56,550
but they're not,
they're not happy about the potential of

393
00:17:56,551 --> 00:17:57,384
progress.

394
00:17:57,910 --> 00:17:59,530
All right,
so there's a lot there.

395
00:17:59,531 --> 00:18:00,310
So let's,
uh,

396
00:18:00,310 --> 00:18:01,150
let's pause it.
That's a,

397
00:18:01,151 --> 00:18:04,750
how did you get involved in this?
Cause I can see how passionate it is for

398
00:18:04,751 --> 00:18:05,584
you and obviously you've staked out a 
position that is not politically 

399
00:18:08,321 --> 00:18:11,050
popular.
So like when you go to this rally in New

400
00:18:11,050 --> 00:18:11,411
York City,
it's,

401
00:18:11,411 --> 00:18:14,870
it's not fun being yelled at people and 
told you're evil and you're a sick.

402
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:16,360
People were saying,
Jerry said he's a sell out,

403
00:18:16,361 --> 00:18:17,770
they don't know anything about you.
You know what I mean?

404
00:18:17,771 --> 00:18:21,280
So how did you even get involved and 
interested in this in the first place?

405
00:18:21,740 --> 00:18:22,251
Well,
I mean,

406
00:18:22,251 --> 00:18:26,540
being full and a queen popular I think 
is a pretty poor goal to have.

407
00:18:26,630 --> 00:18:27,650
Yeah.
I mean,

408
00:18:27,651 --> 00:18:28,940
I,
I'm really,

409
00:18:28,941 --> 00:18:29,774
so my background was I was like a total 
math science kid until I was 14 or 15 

410
00:18:34,581 --> 00:18:36,410
years old.
Like no interest in politics,

411
00:18:36,411 --> 00:18:37,244
no interest in writing.
I thought those people were the biggest 

412
00:18:38,511 --> 00:18:39,344
losers,
like what I do in terms of primarily 

413
00:18:41,241 --> 00:18:43,550
being a philosopher and talking about 
things like as a kid,

414
00:18:43,551 --> 00:18:44,384
I thought there was no worst thing that 
you could do with your life if you were 

415
00:18:47,181 --> 00:18:48,014
to be good.
What you had to do was you had to be an 

416
00:18:49,191 --> 00:18:50,900
athlete,
a businessman,

417
00:18:51,020 --> 00:18:54,650
or like a scientist slash engineer.
When I was 14 years old,

418
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:56,870
like kind of the peak of my scientific 
career,

419
00:18:56,871 --> 00:19:00,230
I won the national nat a Mars rover 
design contest.

420
00:19:00,620 --> 00:19:02,090
And so that was totally my direction.

421
00:19:02,090 --> 00:19:02,923
I remember having a conversation with 
some friends and they were arguing 

422
00:19:04,851 --> 00:19:05,930
liberal and conservative.
They said,

423
00:19:05,931 --> 00:19:06,890
what are you?
I said,

424
00:19:06,891 --> 00:19:08,510
what's the liberal?
What's a conservative?

425
00:19:08,511 --> 00:19:10,310
You know,
which most people at 14 know that,

426
00:19:10,370 --> 00:19:11,203
right?
And they started making fun of me and I 

427
00:19:11,901 --> 00:19:12,470
said,
you know what?

428
00:19:12,470 --> 00:19:15,470
I'm tired of all you idiots.
Like yelling at each other and nothing.

429
00:19:15,530 --> 00:19:16,363
I hated it because it was so illogical 
and people were just yelling and there 

430
00:19:18,591 --> 00:19:19,640
was no common ground.
I said,

431
00:19:19,641 --> 00:19:21,740
you know what?
I'm going to think logically about this,

432
00:19:22,070 --> 00:19:22,903
just like I do a bad engineering.
And sort of since then I've just been 

433
00:19:25,491 --> 00:19:26,324
fascinated with the question of what are
the fundamental things that actually 

434
00:19:29,751 --> 00:19:33,260
lead human beings to success?
What are what I call now the fundamental

435
00:19:33,261 --> 00:19:34,094
principles of human progress?
And I went through being a liberal 

436
00:19:36,890 --> 00:19:38,450
conservative,
a libertarian,

437
00:19:38,630 --> 00:19:39,463
and as you mentioned,
discovering Ayn rand when I was 18 we 

438
00:19:41,270 --> 00:19:42,103
had a really big impact on me,
but I really cared about that issue and 

439
00:19:45,201 --> 00:19:46,034
it really bothered me that people 
couldn't have intelligent discussions 

440
00:19:48,801 --> 00:19:51,410
and that there was no common a frame of 
reference.

441
00:19:51,410 --> 00:19:52,243
So a lot of my career,
really all my career has been a trying 

442
00:19:54,141 --> 00:19:56,540
to figure out what needs to progress and
be,

443
00:19:56,541 --> 00:20:00,620
how to persuade other people.
So when I see the anti human movement,

444
00:20:00,621 --> 00:20:01,454
as I call it,
I think that movement contradicts every 

445
00:20:03,621 --> 00:20:04,454
fundamental principle of progress.
I think it contradicts human 

446
00:20:06,171 --> 00:20:07,004
flourishing.
I think it contradicts individual 

447
00:20:08,271 --> 00:20:09,104
freedom.
I think it contradicts critical 

448
00:20:10,071 --> 00:20:10,904
thinking.
I think it contradicts our nature as 

449
00:20:12,650 --> 00:20:16,670
transformers of nature.
So I really hate it and I hated it since

450
00:20:16,671 --> 00:20:17,504
I was 18 and I've loved ability and,
and I only got into energy like nine 

451
00:20:21,231 --> 00:20:22,041
years later,
but I,

452
00:20:22,041 --> 00:20:24,580
I really oppose the anti human movement.
So it's,

453
00:20:24,590 --> 00:20:26,330
it's,
it's about fossil fuels,

454
00:20:26,331 --> 00:20:28,670
but it's about every form of making life
better.

455
00:20:28,671 --> 00:20:29,504
And I think fossil fuels is one of many 
things that's really good that the 

456
00:20:32,481 --> 00:20:34,520
Greens have misrepresented as poison us.

457
00:20:34,620 --> 00:20:36,120
Right?
So we'll get to the Greens in a second.

458
00:20:36,121 --> 00:20:36,790
But,
so I,

459
00:20:36,790 --> 00:20:38,940
I'd imagine that a certain amount of 
people watching this are going to say,

460
00:20:38,941 --> 00:20:41,220
all right,
so he's into fossil fuels.

461
00:20:41,250 --> 00:20:43,350
Andy's into iron rand and they're going 
to say,

462
00:20:43,351 --> 00:20:44,310
well,
I'm red.

463
00:20:44,490 --> 00:20:46,860
It was somehow selfish.
I mean that's when I,

464
00:20:46,890 --> 00:20:47,723
when I've talked to your own Brooke,
when I talked to mark Pellegrino and a 

465
00:20:49,781 --> 00:20:52,460
few other people that that seems to be 
the main critique that it,

466
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:54,970
it,
there's a selfishness to this.

467
00:20:54,971 --> 00:20:57,760
And when I had John Fugelsang,
who's a bar lefty on,

468
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,320
you know,
that's what he was attacking.

469
00:20:59,350 --> 00:21:02,300
You got him on the week after I had your
own and it was like we did one and then,

470
00:21:02,310 --> 00:21:04,400
and then we did the complete opposite.
And I think they're good.

471
00:21:04,430 --> 00:21:09,430
They will try to link the objectivism 
idea to,

472
00:21:09,670 --> 00:21:10,503
well,
you're just want to use everything now 

473
00:21:11,291 --> 00:21:13,960
while you can and you're not going to 
leave anything for anyone else.

474
00:21:13,961 --> 00:21:16,390
Now I'm pretty sure you're going to say 
that's not the case,

475
00:21:16,630 --> 00:21:17,620
but I'll,
uh,

476
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:18,513
I'll leave it there.

477
00:21:19,060 --> 00:21:19,893
I,
I'd be surprised if they made that 

478
00:21:21,411 --> 00:21:24,500
connection from what I've said so far.
So,

479
00:21:24,501 --> 00:21:28,460
so what I've said so far is related time
ran in terms of thinking about things in

480
00:21:28,461 --> 00:21:29,294
the full context,
which I think is a very important 

481
00:21:30,471 --> 00:21:33,200
principle and certainly one that I 
learned a lot about,

482
00:21:33,660 --> 00:21:34,493
uh,
from her,

483
00:21:34,580 --> 00:21:35,413
but that that should go toward this idea
of being integrated in our thinking and 

484
00:21:39,351 --> 00:21:41,260
long range about our thinking.
So I,

485
00:21:41,261 --> 00:21:44,330
I can't take anything I said so far as 
short range,

486
00:21:44,331 --> 00:21:46,220
but in terms of selfish,
I mean,

487
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:47,473
what does selfish mean?
And this is another issue where we need 

488
00:21:49,041 --> 00:21:50,990
clarity.
So that to me is selfish.

489
00:21:50,991 --> 00:21:54,830
Means that I act from my own interest.
But I think the proper interpretation of

490
00:21:54,831 --> 00:21:55,664
the moral interpretation of that is that
I do that in harmony with everyone else 

491
00:21:59,050 --> 00:22:01,220
doing so.
But even if I didn't,

492
00:22:01,610 --> 00:22:02,443
I mean,
if the climate is actually just ruining 

493
00:22:04,221 --> 00:22:07,300
everyone's life right now,
that's not selfish about itself.

494
00:22:07,450 --> 00:22:08,283
So there's this idea of the harmony of 
human interests and that would apply 

495
00:22:11,031 --> 00:22:11,864
here.
So that's why we need to explore 

496
00:22:12,651 --> 00:22:16,730
something like co2 because if c two is 
really making the world into an inferno,

497
00:22:17,060 --> 00:22:18,290
uh,
whether you're an ego,

498
00:22:18,291 --> 00:22:19,280
esther,
an altruist,

499
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:22,250
lots of people are going to get hurt.

500
00:22:22,330 --> 00:22:22,991
Yeah.
For the record,

501
00:22:22,991 --> 00:22:26,740
I don't believe the premise that I left,
but I know that that's a lot.

502
00:22:26,770 --> 00:22:29,230
That's one of the critiques that I hear 
a lot because I know that if you,

503
00:22:29,290 --> 00:22:31,570
if you live in a way that's for 
yourself,

504
00:22:31,870 --> 00:22:34,630
we'll living a good life for yourself 
means not destroying the environment.

505
00:22:34,631 --> 00:22:35,680
Cause you have to live in the 
environment.

506
00:22:35,681 --> 00:22:36,514
It means helping other people in your 
community because you've got to live 

507
00:22:38,171 --> 00:22:40,690
with these other people.
But I don't view that as selfish.

508
00:22:40,691 --> 00:22:43,000
But I know that that's one of the,
one of the critiques.

509
00:22:43,001 --> 00:22:45,880
So that's what I wanted to throw it out.
Hope hopefully.

510
00:22:45,881 --> 00:22:47,110
But we'll see what happens.
Um,

511
00:22:47,250 --> 00:22:48,083
all right,
so basically you're saying that we have 

512
00:22:50,891 --> 00:22:52,720
this stuff,
it's here,

513
00:22:52,750 --> 00:22:53,583
it is not only good,
but it has created more good then then 

514
00:22:57,280 --> 00:23:00,850
pretty much anything else that in the 
last 300 years we have more,

515
00:23:01,010 --> 00:23:02,290
uh,
public health.

516
00:23:02,291 --> 00:23:03,124
We have more ability to do things and 
transformed societies and that there's 

517
00:23:07,091 --> 00:23:09,340
just nothing to compare to that is that

518
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:13,790
I think it's important though that it's 
primarily a future looking perspective.

519
00:23:13,791 --> 00:23:14,624
So I hear both the opponents and the 
supporters of fossil fuels often talk 

520
00:23:17,991 --> 00:23:19,220
about this as if this is,
uh,

521
00:23:19,460 --> 00:23:22,580
this is an issue in the past where it's 
just a history lesson,

522
00:23:22,581 --> 00:23:22,871
right?
Right.

523
00:23:22,871 --> 00:23:23,451
Like,
oh,

524
00:23:23,451 --> 00:23:26,930
fossil fuel is brought us here,
therefore we have to use them.

525
00:23:26,931 --> 00:23:29,390
And then the opponents say,
sometimes I say Epstein,

526
00:23:29,540 --> 00:23:30,373
Oh,
you're just showing that fossil fuels 

527
00:23:30,981 --> 00:23:33,060
were useful in the past,
but not useful in the president.

528
00:23:33,090 --> 00:23:35,690
I think if people read my book,
and that's not at all true,

529
00:23:35,691 --> 00:23:36,524
I,
it's important to understand the past 

530
00:23:37,641 --> 00:23:39,770
history of energy for a couple of 
reasons.

531
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:41,073
Uh,
one which I talked about in chapter one 

532
00:23:42,081 --> 00:23:42,914
of the book,
the secret history of fossil fuels is 

533
00:23:43,911 --> 00:23:48,230
that all the catastrophist made today 
are actually very old predictions.

534
00:23:48,231 --> 00:23:50,870
There are several decades old,
they have been tested,

535
00:23:50,900 --> 00:23:51,770
they've failed.

536
00:23:51,770 --> 00:23:54,080
And so we have a lot of material for 
analysis.

537
00:23:54,560 --> 00:23:55,393
Uh,
but even more important in terms of 

538
00:23:56,630 --> 00:23:57,463
energy,
if we look at the relationship between 

539
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,400
energy use and every aspect of human 
life,

540
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:04,340
we see this very dramatic positive 
correlation.

541
00:24:04,550 --> 00:24:06,740
And what that points to is what is 
energy?

542
00:24:06,741 --> 00:24:08,990
So I mentioned I am and why it's 
important.

543
00:24:08,991 --> 00:24:09,681
So I mentioned,
you know,

544
00:24:09,681 --> 00:24:12,260
fossil fuels as a potential source of 
energy,

545
00:24:12,261 --> 00:24:14,640
this high energy hydrocarbon.
Um,

546
00:24:14,810 --> 00:24:17,210
but the fundamental behind that is what 
is energy?

547
00:24:17,270 --> 00:24:21,050
So energy is really our ability to use 
machines to improve our lives.

548
00:24:21,350 --> 00:24:24,080
And what we see is the more access to 
that we have,

549
00:24:24,260 --> 00:24:26,780
the better we can make everything.
And I mean,

550
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:28,010
everything,
everything,

551
00:24:28,250 --> 00:24:30,050
everything.
So I go to a lot of trouble,

552
00:24:30,460 --> 00:24:31,310
uh,
to show that.

553
00:24:31,311 --> 00:24:32,091
So,
you know,

554
00:24:32,091 --> 00:24:32,924
from agriculture I mentioned,
so I literally say the oil industry 

555
00:24:35,331 --> 00:24:37,610
solve world hunger and people think 
that's a joke.

556
00:24:37,611 --> 00:24:38,690
But it's really true

557
00:24:39,080 --> 00:24:42,700
because basically we could far more and 
create more for more people.

558
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:44,250
Basically you,
you know,

559
00:24:44,251 --> 00:24:46,440
you and I as human beings,
we might work out,

560
00:24:46,650 --> 00:24:47,880
but we're very weak,
right?

561
00:24:47,881 --> 00:24:49,650
We can't,
we're not superman right now.

562
00:24:49,651 --> 00:24:50,484
If we had superman,
we wouldn't need oil because superman 

563
00:24:52,891 --> 00:24:56,280
has real skill is not reg rescuing Lois 
Lane has real skill.

564
00:24:56,281 --> 00:24:58,470
Is Industrialization right off I had a 
superman.

565
00:24:58,590 --> 00:24:59,730
I would just say like,
you know,

566
00:24:59,731 --> 00:25:02,070
get all the ore out of the minds and 
like

567
00:25:02,260 --> 00:25:04,570
that's his who super power is power.
For the record.

568
00:25:04,571 --> 00:25:05,404
I just watched that Batman Superman 
thing and I don't even know what his 

569
00:25:06,851 --> 00:25:08,890
skill is at this point.
That thing was such a freaking mess.

570
00:25:08,950 --> 00:25:10,460
Okay.
So that's a total sidebar,

571
00:25:11,190 --> 00:25:14,460
but I okay.
Okay.

572
00:25:14,461 --> 00:25:16,100
So I'm going to get dumb.
See you.

573
00:25:16,140 --> 00:25:17,740
You want to work on an intellectual 
level.

574
00:25:17,741 --> 00:25:20,620
If you need like three hours of like 
dumbing your brain,

575
00:25:21,420 --> 00:25:24,300
that's your mind fly a lot.
So my usual remedy is to watch the,

576
00:25:24,510 --> 00:25:25,920
cause I have this temptation to go to 
the theater.

577
00:25:25,930 --> 00:25:26,763
So I just say I'll wait three months,
I'll watch the first five minutes and 

578
00:25:28,231 --> 00:25:29,940
I'll hate it.
And then I'll never,

579
00:25:30,330 --> 00:25:32,460
I'll never have to deal with it but put 
money on it.

580
00:25:32,461 --> 00:25:32,940
So,
so,

581
00:25:32,940 --> 00:25:34,290
okay.
So we have anyway,

582
00:25:34,340 --> 00:25:38,640
like basically what oil allows us to do 
is to be like superman.

583
00:25:38,670 --> 00:25:42,760
We can multiply or any form of energy,
but if we can multiply our,

584
00:25:42,820 --> 00:25:44,160
our,
the amount of energy,

585
00:25:44,161 --> 00:25:47,370
the amount of power we have by a hundred
times or more,

586
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:48,353
and that enables 1% of us to be farmers 
instead of nearly a hundred percent in 

587
00:25:53,701 --> 00:25:55,380
the past.
So it's just this amazing thing.

588
00:25:55,381 --> 00:25:56,214
But one other example that just to show 
you the breadth of it is medical 

589
00:25:59,401 --> 00:26:00,600
research.
Because often I'll say,

590
00:26:00,930 --> 00:26:05,400
we'll get look at these insane 
correlations between energy use and life

591
00:26:05,401 --> 00:26:05,970
expectancy.

592
00:26:05,970 --> 00:26:06,541
And they'll say,
oh,

593
00:26:06,541 --> 00:26:09,300
that has nothing to do with energy.
It's just medical research.

594
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:10,440
And I said,
well,

595
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:13,380
how did those researchers get time to do
that research?

596
00:26:13,470 --> 00:26:15,990
Because he certainly didn't mean any 
time when they're on the farm.

597
00:26:16,290 --> 00:26:20,970
So basically the more physical labor we 
can do through machines,

598
00:26:21,150 --> 00:26:23,340
the more time we can spend doing mental 
labor,

599
00:26:23,341 --> 00:26:25,680
including both of us have mental labor 
careers,

600
00:26:25,690 --> 00:26:26,160
right?
Right.

601
00:26:26,160 --> 00:26:27,480
So we need to be very,
uh,

602
00:26:27,750 --> 00:26:29,700
we need to be very appreciative of,
of energy.

603
00:26:29,940 --> 00:26:31,650
But,
so to go back to your question,

604
00:26:31,770 --> 00:26:32,603
what I'm saying about fossil fuels is 
not merely they were a good source of 

605
00:26:35,491 --> 00:26:36,324
energy and we should sort of be grateful
and give them a gold watch or something 

606
00:26:39,091 --> 00:26:40,320
like that.
What I'm saying is,

607
00:26:40,321 --> 00:26:45,150
if you look at the ways of generating 
energy by the standard of what's cheap,

608
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:46,740
plentiful,
reliable,

609
00:26:46,741 --> 00:26:47,574
and scalable to billions of people,
no industry comes close to what the 

610
00:26:51,331 --> 00:26:53,000
fossil fuel industry,
uh,

611
00:26:53,160 --> 00:26:53,993
can do.
And so in terms of our moral 

612
00:26:54,721 --> 00:26:58,200
calculations for what we want to do over
the next several decades,

613
00:26:58,201 --> 00:26:59,034
that has to be factored into the big 
picture along with these potential 

614
00:27:01,831 --> 00:27:03,300
negatives that we can talk about it.

615
00:27:03,340 --> 00:27:04,173
Right?
So I'm guessing that some people would 

616
00:27:05,021 --> 00:27:06,220
hear that and say,
okay,

617
00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:08,740
if the,
even if I take all of that as crew,

618
00:27:08,741 --> 00:27:10,330
why not?
At the same time,

619
00:27:10,540 --> 00:27:14,620
if there is some risk related to co two 
emissions and uh,

620
00:27:14,650 --> 00:27:16,660
you know,
greenhouse effect and all that stuff,

621
00:27:16,870 --> 00:27:21,870
why not just at this moment just start a
massive transition to green?

622
00:27:22,870 --> 00:27:25,470
Well,
so we can talk about green but,

623
00:27:25,500 --> 00:27:26,333
but you might make the,
it would be a stronger argument if it 

624
00:27:27,611 --> 00:27:28,444
were alternatives.
And then we can talk about why the 

625
00:27:30,311 --> 00:27:32,650
Greens are anti-nuclear an anti hydro 
hydro,

626
00:27:32,651 --> 00:27:35,020
which are the only decent non 
[inaudible] two.

627
00:27:35,110 --> 00:27:35,561
Right.
Okay.

628
00:27:35,561 --> 00:27:36,640
Sorry.
So let's do that then.

629
00:27:36,641 --> 00:27:40,180
So they'd hear what you said that okay,
I'll I buy all of that.

630
00:27:40,210 --> 00:27:41,043
Right.
That means said if it's still putting 

631
00:27:42,581 --> 00:27:43,414
out some bad stuff into the atmosphere 
and we're not sure what exactly what 

632
00:27:46,061 --> 00:27:46,894
that's going to do.
And even if we cut our emissions in the 

633
00:27:48,611 --> 00:27:51,460
United States that India and China are 
still going through what we went through

634
00:27:51,461 --> 00:27:55,300
50 years ago and they're going to keep 
one of this about why not just make that

635
00:27:55,301 --> 00:27:56,470
transition anyway.

636
00:27:57,300 --> 00:27:58,133
So this is a couple of issues here,
but one is his thinking in the full 

637
00:27:59,781 --> 00:28:02,450
context means being really clear about 
magnitude.

638
00:28:02,451 --> 00:28:03,284
So one is what is the magnitude of 
superiority of what the fossil fuel 

639
00:28:06,231 --> 00:28:07,064
industry is doing versus the others.
And then what is the magnitude of the 

640
00:28:09,501 --> 00:28:11,300
downsides?
So let's say hypothetically,

641
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:14,120
so Al Gore gave the speech in 2008.
Al Gore,

642
00:28:14,121 --> 00:28:14,650
my,
my,

643
00:28:14,650 --> 00:28:16,520
my uh,
favorite person here.

644
00:28:16,521 --> 00:28:17,061
Your buddy,
we'll,

645
00:28:17,061 --> 00:28:18,550
we'll get to,
I'll go ahead with my buddy,

646
00:28:18,620 --> 00:28:19,453
but he said we should outlaw by the year
2018 all what he calls a non renewable 

647
00:28:24,081 --> 00:28:26,660
sources of power.
So basically he wanted solar,

648
00:28:26,661 --> 00:28:30,140
wind and some geothermal and he claimed 
we could do this in he clammed.

649
00:28:30,141 --> 00:28:30,974
I know of renewable sources that can 
generate energy for the equivalent of 

650
00:28:33,591 --> 00:28:37,130
less than a dollar a gallon of gasoline.
Now I've asked what this is.

651
00:28:37,131 --> 00:28:37,964
He still has not named this source,
but he was willing to outlaw all of 

652
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:42,230
American energy,
right?

653
00:28:42,410 --> 00:28:43,243
In order to do it.
So and at the same time he would claim 

654
00:28:45,171 --> 00:28:48,260
that we're decades away from 20 foot sea
level rises,

655
00:28:48,500 --> 00:28:50,240
which would be a very,
very negative thing.

656
00:28:50,241 --> 00:28:50,751
You know,
very,

657
00:28:50,751 --> 00:28:51,584
very hard to justice.
That's kind of a one scenario of 

658
00:28:53,541 --> 00:28:58,541
magnitudes where fossil fuel industry 
actually has no magnitude of superiority

659
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:04,000
in terms of generating energy and it has
an incredible damage,

660
00:29:04,100 --> 00:29:05,390
right?
And incredible downside.

661
00:29:05,720 --> 00:29:06,553
But what if it was true that say we had 
a minor amount of warming and that the 

662
00:29:11,061 --> 00:29:15,530
fossil fuel industry was just way,
way it was generations ahead of everyone

663
00:29:15,531 --> 00:29:17,480
else.
In terms of transition,

664
00:29:17,481 --> 00:29:18,314
I think the implication would be,
and I think this is implication no 

665
00:29:20,031 --> 00:29:22,910
matter what is that you would want a 
free market,

666
00:29:23,300 --> 00:29:24,133
a transition.
So you'd want to look at what are other 

667
00:29:26,811 --> 00:29:30,800
technologies and are there any things we
can do to liberate them.

668
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:31,633
And I think the number one thing you 
could observe is that the 

669
00:29:33,741 --> 00:29:34,574
environmentalist since the 70s have made
nuclear power drastically more 

670
00:29:37,161 --> 00:29:39,050
expensive.
Many times more expensive.

671
00:29:39,320 --> 00:29:42,820
So instead of the cost going down time,
which is the natural progression,

672
00:29:42,821 --> 00:29:46,570
as human ingenuity is applied,
the cost has gone up many fold.

673
00:29:46,840 --> 00:29:50,440
Even though nuclear is provably the 
safest form of power ever.

674
00:29:50,441 --> 00:29:51,040
Device.
Yeah.

675
00:29:51,040 --> 00:29:52,000
Wait,
let's pause there for a sec.

676
00:29:52,001 --> 00:29:55,450
So they made the cost go up because they
force what you would,

677
00:29:55,451 --> 00:29:58,420
I think argue are unnecessary 
regulations essentially.

678
00:29:58,560 --> 00:30:01,120
Um,
with everything in life you have to do,

679
00:30:01,150 --> 00:30:01,983
you have to have a certain threshold.
So basically their threshold of safety 

680
00:30:05,410 --> 00:30:06,243
is what they would call infinite.
So let's say nuclear is a hundred times 

681
00:30:09,131 --> 00:30:11,410
safer than any form of power.
I don't know the exact numbers,

682
00:30:11,411 --> 00:30:13,060
but that's not implausible,
right?

683
00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:14,590
They'll say basically,
no,

684
00:30:14,591 --> 00:30:16,540
it has to be a million times safer.

685
00:30:16,660 --> 00:30:17,493
And so,
um,

686
00:30:17,530 --> 00:30:19,390
you know,
at a certain point you can make anything

687
00:30:19,391 --> 00:30:22,390
infinitely expensive by having an 
unlimited number of employees,

688
00:30:22,600 --> 00:30:23,433
you know,
unlimited amount of containment or an 

689
00:30:24,641 --> 00:30:25,474
unlimited amount of time,
which is perhaps the most damaging 

690
00:30:27,281 --> 00:30:28,960
thing.
So you have a nuclear reactor.

691
00:30:28,961 --> 00:30:30,850
It used to be able to build these things
in a couple of years.

692
00:30:31,150 --> 00:30:31,983
Now you can basically not build them 
your chances of building them or 

693
00:30:34,390 --> 00:30:37,660
certainly less than one half and it 
takes over 20 years.

694
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:38,673
So that kind of thing,
because in effect they've co because of 

695
00:30:40,871 --> 00:30:43,270
the regulations that they've helped push
through through governments,

696
00:30:43,570 --> 00:30:44,403
they've called,
they've forced the price to go up 

697
00:30:45,341 --> 00:30:47,440
because you need more people,
you need more research,

698
00:30:47,441 --> 00:30:49,790
you need more capital or capital and 
mean.

699
00:30:49,920 --> 00:30:52,060
If you just think about like if somebody
says,

700
00:30:52,061 --> 00:30:53,170
hey dave,
I,

701
00:30:53,171 --> 00:30:54,004
you know,
I needed some money and like you just 

702
00:30:54,611 --> 00:30:56,110
came into all this money through 
patriot,

703
00:30:56,150 --> 00:30:56,491
you know,
you're,

704
00:30:56,491 --> 00:30:58,060
you're all,
you're really successful now.

705
00:30:58,210 --> 00:30:59,470
Like help us,
help us,

706
00:30:59,920 --> 00:31:03,990
help us find an answer that had to land 
it.

707
00:31:04,150 --> 00:31:05,980
At minimum it's going to be ready in 20 
years,

708
00:31:06,040 --> 00:31:09,460
but it may never be approved.
What are you going to,

709
00:31:10,030 --> 00:31:10,930
are you going to do that?
I mean,

710
00:31:10,931 --> 00:31:11,764
there's no way you want to touch that.
And then what happens is because of 

711
00:31:14,891 --> 00:31:15,724
that,
they have to get subsidies and special 

712
00:31:17,051 --> 00:31:18,820
loans and then the green say,
seat,

713
00:31:19,300 --> 00:31:19,961
look,
your,

714
00:31:19,961 --> 00:31:21,820
you can't compete on the free market.
But it's like,

715
00:31:21,821 --> 00:31:22,391
you know,
bashing.

716
00:31:22,391 --> 00:31:24,640
And Michael Jr.
It's like the Tonya harding approach,

717
00:31:24,641 --> 00:31:26,190
right?
It's like Nancy Kerry.

718
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:27,520
See Nancy Kerrigan.
You can't,

719
00:31:27,580 --> 00:31:29,920
you can't compete on the free skating 
market.

720
00:31:29,921 --> 00:31:30,754
No,
but you're not allowed to bash the 

721
00:31:31,230 --> 00:31:32,063
person's leg.
So my point is that a real alternative 

722
00:31:34,721 --> 00:31:38,830
energy policy is just a free market.
So that's what you get.

723
00:31:38,831 --> 00:31:41,980
And you had much more of that in the 
seventies then you do today.

724
00:31:41,980 --> 00:31:44,230
So I think it's very revealing that 
they're not for that,

725
00:31:44,231 --> 00:31:45,064
but,
but my own evaluation of the negatives 

726
00:31:46,661 --> 00:31:48,280
of fossil fuels,
particularly with CO2,

727
00:31:48,520 --> 00:31:50,290
is that they're much,
much less than people think.

728
00:31:50,291 --> 00:31:54,250
And therefore I think it's a good thing 
that we're continuing to expand it.

729
00:31:54,580 --> 00:31:57,550
And I think it'd be very good if we 
could continue to expand other things.

730
00:31:57,790 --> 00:31:59,530
But whatever's competitive on the free 
market,

731
00:31:59,531 --> 00:32:03,040
we shouldn't force people to use junk 
because that just increases the price.

732
00:32:03,041 --> 00:32:05,620
But I think there's a lot of different 
exciting things,

733
00:32:05,621 --> 00:32:06,454
but,
but I think they're generally the 

734
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:09,670
opposite of green energy,
which you raised before.

735
00:32:09,671 --> 00:32:10,504
And so there's a question of why are the
Greens obsessed with what I call the 

736
00:32:12,971 --> 00:32:14,710
unreliables with solar?
And Wind,

737
00:32:14,860 --> 00:32:15,693
they can't reliably produce electricity.
Why is that their number one focus 

738
00:32:18,881 --> 00:32:22,390
instead of nuclear and hydro?
I think anyone who's sympathetic to them

739
00:32:22,391 --> 00:32:26,410
needs to ask that and really ask is the 
issue co2 or is it something else?

740
00:32:26,440 --> 00:32:28,900
Right.
So on the nuclear front,

741
00:32:29,140 --> 00:32:31,120
um,
would you say the threshold?

742
00:32:31,121 --> 00:32:32,020
Like,
so for example,

743
00:32:32,021 --> 00:32:35,140
what happened in Japan about what was 
about four years ago now,

744
00:32:35,350 --> 00:32:36,183
and they've been saying that this 
reactor has been leaking into the 

745
00:32:37,721 --> 00:32:39,860
Pacific and you know,
you hear people say,

746
00:32:39,861 --> 00:32:39,980
well

747
00:32:39,980 --> 00:32:40,813
now this stuff is eventually going to 
make its way over to the west coast of 

748
00:32:43,971 --> 00:32:46,010
the United States and radiation and all 
that stuff.

749
00:32:46,220 --> 00:32:47,450
Would you say that,
that,

750
00:32:47,500 --> 00:32:48,230
uh,
well first off,

751
00:32:48,230 --> 00:32:50,120
do you agree that that is true?

752
00:32:50,740 --> 00:32:52,690
Well,
this is all a threshold issue.

753
00:32:52,691 --> 00:32:53,524
So the idea,
there's this idea that no amount of 

754
00:32:55,661 --> 00:32:56,494
radiation is safe,
but we're experiencing radiation right 

755
00:32:59,111 --> 00:32:59,944
now.
I'm getting some from the potassium 

756
00:33:01,031 --> 00:33:03,290
inside your body right now.
Right?

757
00:33:03,340 --> 00:33:04,870
If you go to Colorado,
you'll get,

758
00:33:04,930 --> 00:33:07,150
you'll get more radiation if you,
I mean,

759
00:33:07,420 --> 00:33:09,040
I don't know how off color people can 
be,

760
00:33:09,041 --> 00:33:10,300
but the best,
the best go,

761
00:33:10,301 --> 00:33:11,134
go,
go the best nuclear line ever from 

762
00:33:12,941 --> 00:33:13,774
Edward Teller,
which just a Edward Teller was this 

763
00:33:14,981 --> 00:33:18,670
brilliant physicist who,
who helped invent the h bomb and he,

764
00:33:18,671 --> 00:33:21,820
I don't think never got a Nobel prize 
because he was extremely anticommunist.

765
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:23,031
Uh,
but he,

766
00:33:23,031 --> 00:33:23,864
he had this,
he was trying to explain to people that 

767
00:33:25,241 --> 00:33:26,770
you shouldn't be afraid of a nuclear 
power plant.

768
00:33:26,771 --> 00:33:28,960
It basically said if you live right next
to a nuclear power plant,

769
00:33:29,290 --> 00:33:33,220
you get slightly more radiation than you
do by sleeping next to your wife.

770
00:33:33,520 --> 00:33:34,840
He said,
what's the lesson from this?

771
00:33:34,841 --> 00:33:38,140
We'll sleeping with one woman is safe,
but sleeping with more than one is very,

772
00:33:38,141 --> 00:33:40,150
very dangerous.
So yeah,

773
00:33:40,180 --> 00:33:42,510
but that is that.
But that's what you like.

774
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:45,940
People have no concept that it's all 
about the threshold.

775
00:33:46,060 --> 00:33:46,893
So the idea is the,
the question would be is there anything 

776
00:33:49,451 --> 00:33:54,451
resembling a dangerous threshold and you
don't have any deaths at all.

777
00:33:55,061 --> 00:33:55,894
You don't have radiation sickness.
What you do have is scares where people 

778
00:33:59,321 --> 00:34:02,650
do die because of forced evacuation.
So this happened at three mile island as

779
00:34:02,651 --> 00:34:03,760
well.
Nobody died.

780
00:34:03,761 --> 00:34:05,300
There was no threat of death,
uh,

781
00:34:05,350 --> 00:34:06,700
from a,
from radiation.

782
00:34:06,701 --> 00:34:07,534
But you have these elderly populations,
you have them scared and it's because 

783
00:34:10,391 --> 00:34:11,224
there's this demonization and I think 
there's a big parallel between the 

784
00:34:14,141 --> 00:34:18,970
demonization of manmade CO2 and the 
demonization of manmade radiation.

785
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:19,833
And what I would argue is that the anti 
human movement demonizes everything man 

786
00:34:23,091 --> 00:34:27,700
made and we expect it to be bad even 
before we investigate that.

787
00:34:27,701 --> 00:34:28,534
It's bad to expect any change of climate
to be bad before we truly investigate 

788
00:34:32,801 --> 00:34:33,390
it.

789
00:34:33,390 --> 00:34:35,460
Okay.
So the anti human movement,

790
00:34:35,461 --> 00:34:36,294
I like that phrase in general.
It just got very dystopian something 

791
00:34:39,151 --> 00:34:40,200
there.
I like it.

792
00:34:40,470 --> 00:34:43,100
So basically it seems to me that,
that these,

793
00:34:43,380 --> 00:34:44,213
there's an element to these types of 
people that think that everything's 

794
00:34:48,391 --> 00:34:49,620
about us.
Sort of,

795
00:34:50,040 --> 00:34:55,040
that I think you may be,
don't think that they think that there's

796
00:34:55,231 --> 00:34:56,064
something sort of empowering in a way.
If you think that we are controlling 

797
00:34:59,281 --> 00:35:00,114
that through our actions,
we're controlling the environment in a 

798
00:35:02,941 --> 00:35:04,200
way.
It's a very,

799
00:35:04,260 --> 00:35:06,720
uh,
it's really focused on you.

800
00:35:06,930 --> 00:35:07,960
You know what I mean?
That by,

801
00:35:08,020 --> 00:35:08,853
you know,
I live in West Hollywood where we don't 

802
00:35:09,811 --> 00:35:12,330
have plastic bags anymore.
And at trader Joe's,

803
00:35:12,331 --> 00:35:14,280
if I have to pay 10 cents for a paper 
bag,

804
00:35:14,281 --> 00:35:15,114
which I usually do well,
but they prefer that you bring your own 

805
00:35:16,801 --> 00:35:18,310
bag.
And I always think like I,

806
00:35:18,330 --> 00:35:21,360
it's nice that we're doing this and I 
tried to bring my bag when I can,

807
00:35:21,660 --> 00:35:24,510
but like I always think it's more like 
we're just sort of doing this to sort of

808
00:35:24,511 --> 00:35:28,500
feel good about ourselves really.
Because no matter what we do here,

809
00:35:28,530 --> 00:35:31,110
especially on that very local level,
as I said before,

810
00:35:31,111 --> 00:35:31,944
China and India are going through their 
industrial revolution now they're going 

811
00:35:34,641 --> 00:35:36,030
to,
no matter what we do,

812
00:35:36,031 --> 00:35:36,864
that makes us feel good.
They're going to keep doing all of that 

813
00:35:39,001 --> 00:35:40,860
stuff.
So in some ways it's sort of just,

814
00:35:41,010 --> 00:35:41,843
it's like a combination of sort of lack 
of science and keeping things about 

815
00:35:46,531 --> 00:35:47,640
yourself.
Did that,

816
00:35:47,940 --> 00:35:49,410
did I get anywhere on there?
Yeah,

817
00:35:49,780 --> 00:35:52,920
cause this is often the conservative 
criticism,

818
00:35:53,110 --> 00:35:57,280
which I think is generally wrong.
So I don't think so.

819
00:35:57,281 --> 00:36:01,240
I think it's much more that I think it's
much more a hell narrative.

820
00:36:01,241 --> 00:36:02,074
I think if you look at the,
the idea of a hell and what causes you 

821
00:36:04,991 --> 00:36:05,824
to go to hell,
I think that's much more of a parallel 

822
00:36:07,841 --> 00:36:10,210
because if you think of like what causes
you to go to hell,

823
00:36:10,420 --> 00:36:11,253
you know,
you violate a certain commandment and 

824
00:36:12,431 --> 00:36:14,920
the commandment isn't,
it's not necessarily a scientific thing,

825
00:36:15,250 --> 00:36:16,870
it's just that this is what was 
commanded.

826
00:36:16,871 --> 00:36:19,540
And if you go against it,
then there's going to be a negative

827
00:36:19,570 --> 00:36:21,760
causing my gaze.
Cause earthquakes kind of thing.

828
00:36:22,740 --> 00:36:24,820
Sure.
That you don't buy into,

829
00:36:25,500 --> 00:36:27,460
no,
I don't know that I've ever heard it.

830
00:36:27,550 --> 00:36:28,660
Well at least you know,
Pat Roberts,

831
00:36:28,661 --> 00:36:30,040
it'll get every time there's an 
earthquake,

832
00:36:30,130 --> 00:36:33,040
you know,
power of the [inaudible] fracking.

833
00:36:33,041 --> 00:36:34,390
So told us,
okay,

834
00:36:34,391 --> 00:36:36,820
now this is defragging instead of the 
deans out,

835
00:36:37,820 --> 00:36:41,260
hypothetically plausible causal relation
to you imagine a gay fracking,

836
00:36:41,261 --> 00:36:43,570
then he'd really,
I can't actually,

837
00:36:44,140 --> 00:36:46,030
that would be something I can,
yeah.

838
00:36:46,200 --> 00:36:47,160
Um,
okay,

839
00:36:47,161 --> 00:36:48,990
so what we're going to this idea,
what's the idea that,

840
00:36:48,991 --> 00:36:49,920
that,
that uh,

841
00:36:50,310 --> 00:36:52,890
that,
that it's somehow a view of it's all,

842
00:36:52,920 --> 00:36:54,720
it's all about us,
but so let's,

843
00:36:54,721 --> 00:36:57,810
let's look at it from a different 
direction if you will.

844
00:36:57,811 --> 00:37:02,811
Get Industrialization is all about us in
the sense of we are taking a planet.

845
00:37:03,510 --> 00:37:06,480
And what we're saying about the planet 
is this planet is imperfect.

846
00:37:06,780 --> 00:37:09,570
It's not nearly safe enough in its 
natural state,

847
00:37:09,840 --> 00:37:12,450
and it doesn't have nearly as much stuff
that we can use,

848
00:37:12,630 --> 00:37:14,160
right?
So what we're gonna do is we're going to

849
00:37:14,161 --> 00:37:14,994
transform the heck out of it by using 
our minds to create these machines and 

850
00:37:18,991 --> 00:37:19,824
then create energy that can feed these 
machines and make ourselves a hundreds 

851
00:37:21,991 --> 00:37:22,824
of times more powerful.
And the planet is going to look 

852
00:37:24,301 --> 00:37:26,370
completely different because of what we 
do.

853
00:37:26,371 --> 00:37:29,190
So I called this human progress,
and I think this is fantastic,

854
00:37:29,550 --> 00:37:32,100
but if you look at the Greens are the 
anti humans,

855
00:37:32,370 --> 00:37:33,720
they don't think this is fantastic.

856
00:37:33,720 --> 00:37:34,531
They don't think,
oh,

857
00:37:34,531 --> 00:37:36,660
it's all about us.
Isn't this so great?

858
00:37:36,870 --> 00:37:41,820
What they're always worried about is the
ecology or the ecosystem or Gaia,

859
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:44,940
you know,
having some revenge on us.

860
00:37:45,120 --> 00:37:49,800
But the focus is not really our power.
It's actually our stupidity.

861
00:37:50,040 --> 00:37:50,641
It's the,
it's,

862
00:37:50,641 --> 00:37:51,870
it's our hubris.
They think,

863
00:37:51,900 --> 00:37:54,720
oh you think you can just change 
everything and be okay.

864
00:37:54,721 --> 00:37:59,010
You think that you can split the atom 
and play God and it's going to be fine,

865
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:01,500
but it's not,
you're going to get punished.

866
00:38:01,501 --> 00:38:03,630
And that's why they always have this 
divine retribution.

867
00:38:03,660 --> 00:38:06,990
Except it's not divine.
It's the ecology.

868
00:38:06,991 --> 00:38:07,824
But no matter what happens,
every decade they have a new form in 

869
00:38:10,921 --> 00:38:14,760
which ecosystem is going to exact 
retribution for our industrial,

870
00:38:14,761 --> 00:38:16,740
since it always changes.
So there's no,

871
00:38:16,770 --> 00:38:21,630
there's no change in the dynamic.
There's just a change in the specific as

872
00:38:21,631 --> 00:38:23,880
the dynamic,
as each dynamic gets refuted.

873
00:38:23,990 --> 00:38:24,950
Yeah.
That's really interesting.

874
00:38:24,951 --> 00:38:28,400
So basically I think that they would 
generally argue that someone like you is

875
00:38:28,401 --> 00:38:29,810
anti-science.
Cause they would say,

876
00:38:29,840 --> 00:38:30,890
okay,
all these climates,

877
00:38:30,930 --> 00:38:32,570
I had to say this,
he's saying the reverse,

878
00:38:32,571 --> 00:38:36,640
but what you're saying is actually bear 
anti-science because yeah,

879
00:38:36,641 --> 00:38:37,474
we split the atom and then they go.
But some bad shit's going to happen 

880
00:38:39,761 --> 00:38:40,870
because we have,
but you would say,

881
00:38:41,050 --> 00:38:42,460
well,
that's what human progress is,

882
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:42,951
right?
Yeah.

883
00:38:42,951 --> 00:38:43,784
Some,
some shit's going to happen and we'll 

884
00:38:45,461 --> 00:38:47,410
have to fee and that's,
we'll figure that out,

885
00:38:47,411 --> 00:38:47,921
right?
I mean,

886
00:38:47,921 --> 00:38:49,750
so that,
that really is the most scientific.

887
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:50,790
Yeah.
So I'd say,

888
00:38:50,791 --> 00:38:51,624
I mean,
fundamentally to put it in [inaudible] 

889
00:38:53,170 --> 00:38:54,690
terms,
I think they're anti mind.

890
00:38:55,170 --> 00:38:56,580
So one,
one way of looking at this,

891
00:38:56,581 --> 00:39:00,000
as I mentioned that there's this idea 
that manmade co two is bad.

892
00:39:00,270 --> 00:39:02,190
Manmade radiation is bad,
but he,

893
00:39:02,200 --> 00:39:04,140
you know,
manmade industrialization is bad.

894
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:07,560
So basically everything manmade is 
considered bad.

895
00:39:07,561 --> 00:39:09,420
So you know,
now at this moment in time,

896
00:39:09,421 --> 00:39:13,200
plastic bags are considered less natural
than paper if you go into whole foods,

897
00:39:13,201 --> 00:39:14,910
right?
It's all about natural,

898
00:39:14,911 --> 00:39:18,540
local as little technology went into 
this product as possible,

899
00:39:18,541 --> 00:39:19,374
right?
That's what green ultimately boils down 

900
00:39:20,761 --> 00:39:21,300
to,
right?

901
00:39:21,300 --> 00:39:22,133
The ideal.
Think about what does the ideal green 

902
00:39:23,701 --> 00:39:24,534
earth,
the ideal green anything is what the 

903
00:39:26,401 --> 00:39:29,070
world would look like if human beings 
had never existed.

904
00:39:29,640 --> 00:39:30,870
That is their ideal,
right?

905
00:39:30,900 --> 00:39:32,730
The eye.
What's the ideal form of food?

906
00:39:32,940 --> 00:39:36,420
The kind of food that we would exist if 
human beings had never existed,

907
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:36,630
right?

908
00:39:36,630 --> 00:39:38,550
What's the ideal amount of co two in the
atmosphere?

909
00:39:38,551 --> 00:39:41,490
The amount of CO2 that would exist if 
human beings had never existed?

910
00:39:41,491 --> 00:39:44,190
What's the amount of radiation if human 
beings never existed?

911
00:39:44,191 --> 00:39:46,710
So that's,
they have this very deep premise.

912
00:39:46,950 --> 00:39:51,780
So what is the manmade?
The manmade is simply the form of change

913
00:39:51,781 --> 00:39:54,390
in nature that exists created by a human
mind.

914
00:39:54,720 --> 00:39:56,160
That's the only difference,
right?

915
00:39:56,190 --> 00:39:57,023
Change is inherent in nature.
That's why climate change is this kind 

916
00:39:58,771 --> 00:40:00,030
of a name term,
right?

917
00:40:00,031 --> 00:40:00,864
But everything changes things.
Everything is transforming things in 

918
00:40:03,151 --> 00:40:05,070
nature.
But the manmade,

919
00:40:05,071 --> 00:40:07,500
the only difference is that it's driven 
by a mind.

920
00:40:07,710 --> 00:40:08,543
So if you're anti manmade,
you're anti mind made and you're anti 

921
00:40:11,431 --> 00:40:13,050
mind.
So then you might ask,

922
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:15,060
why do they appeal the science all the 
time?

923
00:40:15,061 --> 00:40:16,860
Why do they try to take the high ground 
on science?

924
00:40:17,130 --> 00:40:17,963
And the answer is because science has a 
lot of prestige and if you want to put 

925
00:40:20,101 --> 00:40:20,934
over bad ideas in volk science,
but notice they're against all the 

926
00:40:24,091 --> 00:40:28,110
practical products of science,
at least the core one,

927
00:40:28,111 --> 00:40:29,660
the core leaders of the movement.

928
00:40:29,730 --> 00:40:31,220
Well they're using them all the time 
though.

929
00:40:32,090 --> 00:40:32,841
What do you mean?
Well,

930
00:40:32,841 --> 00:40:34,910
they're using all the things that 
science has given us.

931
00:40:34,950 --> 00:40:35,341
Right?
Well,

932
00:40:35,341 --> 00:40:38,340
the way I think of it as this,
like would the green movement,

933
00:40:38,341 --> 00:40:40,380
if it could go back in time with the 
green movement,

934
00:40:40,381 --> 00:40:43,170
have approved turning a patch of dirt 
and trees into New York City?

935
00:40:44,050 --> 00:40:44,883
What day?
What Green Greenpeace of a thumbs up to 

936
00:40:46,731 --> 00:40:48,590
New York City.
I guess at best it would have been a lot

937
00:40:48,591 --> 00:40:50,170
slower.
No chance.

938
00:40:50,570 --> 00:40:51,930
No chance.
Right?

939
00:40:51,950 --> 00:40:53,150
So Central Park would be allowed to 
here.

940
00:40:53,480 --> 00:40:53,600
We,

941
00:40:53,600 --> 00:40:57,560
their philosophy would have prevented 
everything that we know,

942
00:40:57,840 --> 00:40:58,970
uh,
from existing,

943
00:40:59,180 --> 00:41:02,450
but they are parasites on that.
And then they,

944
00:41:02,660 --> 00:41:03,321
you know,
so they're,

945
00:41:03,321 --> 00:41:04,154
they're hypocrites.
But this is the way that all bad ideas 

946
00:41:06,321 --> 00:41:07,154
work is basically the people promoting 
the bad ideas want people to contradict 

947
00:41:10,431 --> 00:41:12,710
them to a certain amount.
Because we followed all the bad ideas.

948
00:41:12,711 --> 00:41:13,760
Everyone would die,
right?

949
00:41:13,761 --> 00:41:17,090
What they want is people to contradict 
them so they can feed off of them.

950
00:41:17,091 --> 00:41:18,710
I mean this is bred out of atlas 
shrugged,

951
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:20,113
but then they can keep them guilty and 
so what they want for the 

952
00:41:21,801 --> 00:41:23,930
industrialists,
like if you look at the oil companies or

953
00:41:23,931 --> 00:41:26,630
any companies,
what they want is for the oil companies,

954
00:41:26,660 --> 00:41:28,190
they don't want the oil companies not to
work.

955
00:41:28,370 --> 00:41:29,203
They want the oil companies to work and 
be super guilty and give them money and 

956
00:41:32,091 --> 00:41:34,010
tell them that they're great for being 
one,

957
00:41:34,250 --> 00:41:35,960
for being nothing,
for accomplishing,

958
00:41:35,961 --> 00:41:37,220
nothing,
for producing nothing.

959
00:41:37,400 --> 00:41:38,233
So it's basically people that very deep 
resentment of productive human beings 

960
00:41:41,930 --> 00:41:42,763
who want to feel important and 
environmentalist are anti humanism gave 

961
00:41:45,531 --> 00:41:47,840
them this perfect vehicle,
but if we call an anti humanism,

962
00:41:48,050 --> 00:41:50,090
they're going to be a lot less confident
and there'll be fewer of them.

963
00:41:50,180 --> 00:41:51,013
Yeah.
It's funny because as you're saying 

964
00:41:51,591 --> 00:41:52,960
that,
it makes me think of,

965
00:41:52,961 --> 00:41:55,760
I've what I've been saying lately about 
just pundits on television,

966
00:41:55,970 --> 00:41:56,803
they've ever made anything,
they've never done anything that's 

967
00:41:58,671 --> 00:41:59,504
created and everything,
but they somehow know how to do 

968
00:42:01,431 --> 00:42:02,720
everything all the time.
You know what I mean?

969
00:42:02,900 --> 00:42:03,733
They always know that healthy,
if we saved $200 billion to do this and 

970
00:42:05,901 --> 00:42:07,820
put this tax cut and Barbara,
and it's like,

971
00:42:07,821 --> 00:42:09,380
well,
you've never done anything.

972
00:42:09,381 --> 00:42:12,230
You just keep saying things,
but you've never actually created.

973
00:42:12,370 --> 00:42:14,390
It's a lot easier to do that then 
actually create,

974
00:42:14,590 --> 00:42:17,550
I think psychologically,
I haven't studied this,

975
00:42:17,551 --> 00:42:18,384
but this is plausible to me.
I've heard different studies that 

976
00:42:20,281 --> 00:42:21,114
there's just a deep and fewer 
inferiority complex among intellectuals 

977
00:42:25,680 --> 00:42:29,490
who just don't really feel productive in
a certain way.

978
00:42:29,491 --> 00:42:30,960
Now,
I don't experience this myself.

979
00:42:30,961 --> 00:42:31,794
I mean,
I think it's useful to learn how to do 

980
00:42:32,671 --> 00:42:33,504
certain kinds of physical things,
but I also am an intellectual who 

981
00:42:36,511 --> 00:42:41,511
worships the physical creators.
So I give them justice and I know,

982
00:42:41,790 --> 00:42:43,110
you know,
who's buttering my bread.

983
00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:44,610
Uh,
so to speak.

984
00:42:44,790 --> 00:42:45,181
Right?
I mean,

985
00:42:45,181 --> 00:42:46,014
I know,
I know when I talked to somebody from 

986
00:42:47,971 --> 00:42:52,050
industry that they are making possible 
my way of life.

987
00:42:52,051 --> 00:42:56,100
And for instance the universities or the
opposite because modern universities,

988
00:42:56,101 --> 00:42:58,050
I mean we have way too many people going
to college I think.

989
00:42:58,260 --> 00:42:59,093
But however many people we would like to
go to college is way more than the 

990
00:43:01,351 --> 00:43:04,500
number that would go to college if we 
were non industrialized.

991
00:43:04,830 --> 00:43:08,880
And yet the universities have incredible
contempt for industry.

992
00:43:08,910 --> 00:43:09,743
And I think it's just a very disturbing 
thing that you have all these talking 

993
00:43:14,071 --> 00:43:14,904
heads,
all these mindless students often and 

994
00:43:17,041 --> 00:43:17,874
they have no appreciation.
So let's say even the fossil fuel 

995
00:43:20,010 --> 00:43:22,410
companies,
we're screwing up way more than I think.

996
00:43:22,411 --> 00:43:23,280
I mean,
I don't even put it though.

997
00:43:23,281 --> 00:43:25,170
I think they're doing a great job in 
general,

998
00:43:25,350 --> 00:43:26,183
but you should still have a lot of 
appreciation for what they're 

999
00:43:28,411 --> 00:43:29,800
accomplishing.
And,

1000
00:43:29,830 --> 00:43:33,780
and you should still realize that you're
paying them to do that.

1001
00:43:33,870 --> 00:43:34,703
So we have this idea where the non 
producers can demand this impossible 

1002
00:43:38,791 --> 00:43:39,624
perfection of the producers and look 
down on them even though you're doing 

1003
00:43:42,601 --> 00:43:43,434
nothing,
which is like the Teddy Roosevelt Teddy 

1004
00:43:45,360 --> 00:43:47,160
Roosevelt quote about the man in the 
arena.

1005
00:43:47,161 --> 00:43:49,860
Like Teddy Roosevelt is really into 
sports and stuff.

1006
00:43:49,861 --> 00:43:53,250
So he talks about how the man in the 
arena is the one who's admirable,

1007
00:43:53,251 --> 00:43:56,310
even though everyone else side.
He said it's not the critic who counts.

1008
00:43:56,350 --> 00:43:57,590
There's right.
That's important.

1009
00:43:57,591 --> 00:43:58,421
Right?
So what are you watching?

1010
00:43:58,421 --> 00:43:59,254
A basketball game.
But they always know every though it's 

1011
00:44:00,670 --> 00:44:01,503
just like

1012
00:44:02,710 --> 00:44:04,550
going on with Lebron.
I mean,

1013
00:44:04,570 --> 00:44:05,210
come on.

1014
00:44:05,210 --> 00:44:07,060
Yeah,
I think that it's,

1015
00:44:07,061 --> 00:44:08,840
I can do that.
So all that said,

1016
00:44:08,841 --> 00:44:09,674
when,
when something like the Exxon Valdez 

1017
00:44:11,120 --> 00:44:14,300
happens or the BP oil spill in the Gulf 
and when these things happen,

1018
00:44:14,600 --> 00:44:16,130
now I get it.
Nothing's,

1019
00:44:16,131 --> 00:44:18,500
nothing's a perfect system.
So these things are gonna happen.

1020
00:44:18,980 --> 00:44:19,813
But for someone like you,
when you see the BP oil spill and you 

1021
00:44:21,591 --> 00:44:22,424
see all of the birds and the auditors 
and all this stuff covered in all this 

1022
00:44:25,461 --> 00:44:26,770
oil and know that,
you know,

1023
00:44:26,780 --> 00:44:29,660
I just remember those days where they 
had a online,

1024
00:44:29,661 --> 00:44:32,040
you could just watch that,
that a pipe,

1025
00:44:32,041 --> 00:44:34,410
that burst pipe just spewing all this 
stuff into the ocean.

1026
00:44:34,980 --> 00:44:35,820
How do you feel about that?

1027
00:44:35,890 --> 00:44:36,910
Well,
it's a negative,

1028
00:44:36,940 --> 00:44:39,490
but there's an end.
There's always this issue of magnitude.

1029
00:44:39,580 --> 00:44:40,413
And I always look,
particularly if I know that we have a 

1030
00:44:41,861 --> 00:44:44,050
tendency to be biased against one 
industry,

1031
00:44:44,051 --> 00:44:46,950
I'm always suspicious of these.
Like why is this?

1032
00:44:47,170 --> 00:44:49,630
Why is the oil spill considered the 
worst thing in the world?

1033
00:44:49,631 --> 00:44:51,730
So to me,
11 people died on that.

1034
00:44:52,180 --> 00:44:53,013
That was the,
that was the tragedy of an mean 11 

1035
00:44:55,570 --> 00:44:56,890
there's thing exploded,

1036
00:44:56,970 --> 00:44:58,280
right?
So the guy who people

1037
00:44:58,390 --> 00:45:00,100
are extinguished,
right?

1038
00:45:00,101 --> 00:45:03,160
I mean they never get to do anything 
again in their families.

1039
00:45:03,161 --> 00:45:04,180
You know,
wives are just,

1040
00:45:04,240 --> 00:45:06,010
there's,
I mean that's the thing.

1041
00:45:06,520 --> 00:45:09,760
If you look at what I mean oil is to use
a green term,

1042
00:45:09,761 --> 00:45:11,500
like an organic substance.
I mean,

1043
00:45:11,501 --> 00:45:15,790
it's just ancient kind of life and lots 
of things in the ocean like it.

1044
00:45:15,791 --> 00:45:17,920
And then certain kinds of animals don't 
like it.

1045
00:45:17,921 --> 00:45:18,754
So,
and of course the only point to the 

1046
00:45:19,871 --> 00:45:20,351
bird,
you know,

1047
00:45:20,351 --> 00:45:22,150
so if it's on a bird,
it'll choke the bird.

1048
00:45:22,480 --> 00:45:23,710
And that's not,
you know,

1049
00:45:23,711 --> 00:45:27,040
that's not something that I relish.
But in terms of the things that happened

1050
00:45:27,041 --> 00:45:30,310
to human beings,
an oil spill is pretty low on the list.

1051
00:45:30,311 --> 00:45:33,760
So what I think it shows is this idea 
again of the manmade.

1052
00:45:33,940 --> 00:45:36,430
If we accidentally put oil somewhere,
it's bad.

1053
00:45:36,640 --> 00:45:37,331
But you know,
there are two,

1054
00:45:37,331 --> 00:45:38,164
Exxon Valdez is coming out of the Gulf 
of Mexico naturally all the time in the 

1055
00:45:41,351 --> 00:45:42,280
form of oil seeps.

1056
00:45:42,460 --> 00:45:45,760
So if you look at the tar sands,
that's just one giant oil spill,

1057
00:45:46,100 --> 00:45:46,933
a by nature in Canada.
So I think we always have to watch out 

1058
00:45:49,631 --> 00:45:53,200
for this bias against the manmade bias 
against the human.

1059
00:45:53,620 --> 00:45:56,740
I think the sort of better examples are,
um,

1060
00:45:56,800 --> 00:45:57,633
I mean it was solar and wind.
There's an example I talk about in the 

1061
00:45:59,051 --> 00:45:59,884
book where when you're mining for those 
elements for the kinds of metals that 

1062
00:46:02,921 --> 00:46:06,040
you use and in solar panels and,
and particularly windmills,

1063
00:46:06,370 --> 00:46:07,203
uh,
people die a lot because they happen in 

1064
00:46:09,701 --> 00:46:12,730
places like China and they're in very 
dangerous situations because you're in,

1065
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:16,330
you're dealing with legitimately 
threatening amounts of radioactivity and

1066
00:46:16,331 --> 00:46:17,164
nobody cares about that.
So I always look at what are the actual 

1067
00:46:19,811 --> 00:46:23,540
threats and non threats of every form of
energy and what I try to do it,

1068
00:46:23,541 --> 00:46:26,770
and I think chapter two of the book is 
go through them in a pretty,

1069
00:46:27,220 --> 00:46:28,053
uh,
fairway cause it's not like I started 

1070
00:46:29,321 --> 00:46:30,850
out being pro fossil fuels.

1071
00:46:31,630 --> 00:46:33,520
It's something that I came to.
I mean,

1072
00:46:33,521 --> 00:46:35,900
as a kid I thought some like solar and 
then I,

1073
00:46:35,901 --> 00:46:38,560
I was never anti-nuclear really.
All the simpsons scared me a little bit,

1074
00:46:38,830 --> 00:46:42,070
but I just kind of always figured,
oh well solar's the greatest thing.

1075
00:46:42,610 --> 00:46:44,860
But then once I looked at the equation,
I thought,

1076
00:46:45,160 --> 00:46:45,993
well,
it's not nearly and why are the Enviros 

1077
00:46:49,001 --> 00:46:52,420
so focused on this when they could be 
focused on nuclear?

1078
00:46:52,600 --> 00:46:54,520
But I mean,
so I think the kind of most,

1079
00:46:55,330 --> 00:46:56,910
you know,
the things that are more of a concern,

1080
00:46:56,920 --> 00:46:58,750
like can you say smog in China?
Right.

1081
00:46:58,751 --> 00:46:59,584
Because to me that's,
that's something where that's clearly a 

1082
00:47:02,111 --> 00:47:05,050
very unpleasant and in some cases 
unhealthy thing,

1083
00:47:05,170 --> 00:47:06,003
right?
Literally affecting someone's life on 

1084
00:47:08,431 --> 00:47:12,420
that day to day basis.
To me that's much more of a concern than

1085
00:47:12,421 --> 00:47:15,120
an oil spill.
So then what in a case like that,

1086
00:47:15,121 --> 00:47:15,954
that you're,
you're acknowledging that it's a 

1087
00:47:17,071 --> 00:47:19,350
legitimate concern.
What do you do?

1088
00:47:19,530 --> 00:47:20,363
I get,
I guess you've now find industry that 

1089
00:47:21,661 --> 00:47:22,620
cleans it up,
right?

1090
00:47:22,650 --> 00:47:24,870
I mean that's,
that's the next level in the colonies.

1091
00:47:24,880 --> 00:47:25,390
Milan.
I,

1092
00:47:25,390 --> 00:47:25,820
I

1093
00:47:25,820 --> 00:47:26,653
like to,
I like to look back in time and just 

1094
00:47:28,581 --> 00:47:29,414
think,
if I like to look at the 18 hundreds 

1095
00:47:30,341 --> 00:47:33,730
it's just sort of a reference point 
because if you look at that time,

1096
00:47:33,731 --> 00:47:36,220
they had much worse smog than China does
today.

1097
00:47:36,221 --> 00:47:37,300
I mean,
what much worse?

1098
00:47:37,570 --> 00:47:40,240
And so the question is,
did they have a green movement that said

1099
00:47:40,241 --> 00:47:42,220
this is ruining everything?
Like we hate it.

1100
00:47:42,580 --> 00:47:43,413
No,
they had that as a letter that I 

1101
00:47:44,860 --> 00:47:47,060
mentioned,
which says basically they,

1102
00:47:47,061 --> 00:47:47,894
they,
they're worried about running out of 

1103
00:47:48,551 --> 00:47:49,384
coal because they don't really 
understand the geology of it and how 

1104
00:47:51,371 --> 00:47:53,830
much of it there is.
And they say,

1105
00:47:54,150 --> 00:47:54,983
you know,
basically this would be like losing a 

1106
00:47:55,991 --> 00:47:57,940
limb.
It would be that bad.

1107
00:47:57,941 --> 00:47:58,774
And again,
this is something that's has all the 

1108
00:47:59,641 --> 00:48:01,300
smoke.
And so from our perspective,

1109
00:48:01,301 --> 00:48:01,751
we think,
oh,

1110
00:48:01,751 --> 00:48:03,190
this is so bad,
it's so dirty.

1111
00:48:03,520 --> 00:48:07,300
But why do they value it so much?
Why don't even focus on that?

1112
00:48:07,570 --> 00:48:12,040
Because the value of energy to empower 
them to improve their lives,

1113
00:48:12,041 --> 00:48:15,130
to actually be fed,
to actually be warm,

1114
00:48:15,340 --> 00:48:17,860
that takes precedence over everything 
else.

1115
00:48:18,040 --> 00:48:21,850
And so then the point is that whenever 
you're defining a threshold of pollution

1116
00:48:22,090 --> 00:48:22,923
that you need to legislate regarding,
you need to have the context of what's 

1117
00:48:27,071 --> 00:48:29,770
overall beneficial for human life and 
what your alternatives are.

1118
00:48:29,980 --> 00:48:30,813
Now,
fortunately today we don't have to 

1119
00:48:32,021 --> 00:48:35,500
accept that threshold of Smog and smoke,
right?

1120
00:48:35,501 --> 00:48:38,440
Because we have all sorts of 
alternatives and we have technology.

1121
00:48:38,560 --> 00:48:39,970
So I think in the case of China,
it's,

1122
00:48:39,990 --> 00:48:43,810
it's a midway case where they could,
because it's a dictatorship,

1123
00:48:44,110 --> 00:48:46,060
because they don't respect individual 
rights in many ways.

1124
00:48:46,061 --> 00:48:47,980
What they did is they built a lot of 
coal plants,

1125
00:48:47,981 --> 00:48:51,310
but it's not primarily coal plants is 
actually other things that you use cold.

1126
00:48:51,310 --> 00:48:53,080
They're just burning it in a very open 
way.

1127
00:48:53,350 --> 00:48:54,183
But they did this very haphazardly 
because they had this national goal of 

1128
00:48:56,831 --> 00:49:00,670
industrialization without focusing on 
the purpose of industrialization,

1129
00:49:00,671 --> 00:49:01,504
which is human flourishing.
So I think if China and India had much 

1130
00:49:03,581 --> 00:49:05,770
better governments that focus on 
individual rights,

1131
00:49:06,070 --> 00:49:07,960
they would have much less.
But that doesn't,

1132
00:49:07,990 --> 00:49:08,823
that's not to say they would have the 
same standards that we do because they 

1133
00:49:10,661 --> 00:49:12,400
don't have the same level of wealth that
we do.

1134
00:49:12,401 --> 00:49:16,630
So it's contextual based on the state of
economic and technological development.

1135
00:49:16,780 --> 00:49:18,970
And one,
one great philosopher in front of mine,

1136
00:49:18,971 --> 00:49:19,804
while I was writing the book,
he gave me this great analogy about you 

1137
00:49:21,951 --> 00:49:23,170
could,
you could say the same thing about human

1138
00:49:23,171 --> 00:49:24,004
health.
So there's a point that I think is 

1139
00:49:24,881 --> 00:49:27,730
really important that people are afraid 
of coal plants.

1140
00:49:28,060 --> 00:49:30,070
You know what,
I'm afraid of you.

1141
00:49:30,730 --> 00:49:33,820
I'm afraid of humans because humans are 
way dirtier.

1142
00:49:34,150 --> 00:49:34,983
Then our machines,
which again shows that were against 

1143
00:49:36,821 --> 00:49:39,220
manmade things because we're afraid of 
machine waste,

1144
00:49:39,460 --> 00:49:41,290
but not human waste,
human waste.

1145
00:49:41,530 --> 00:49:42,400
And particularly,
you know,

1146
00:49:42,401 --> 00:49:46,450
the air we breathe,
breathe out is biological and biological

1147
00:49:46,451 --> 00:49:48,170
as much more dangerous than 
nonbiological.

1148
00:49:48,310 --> 00:49:49,143
So if I get sick,
it's going to be from someone in this 

1149
00:49:51,011 --> 00:49:54,130
room and you know that's how you're 
going to get sick and die most likely.

1150
00:49:54,400 --> 00:49:57,940
So why do we allow ourselves this kind 
of pollution?

1151
00:49:57,941 --> 00:49:58,511
Right?
Well,

1152
00:49:58,511 --> 00:49:59,344
because at the moment it's not 
technologically preventable in any 

1153
00:50:01,961 --> 00:50:02,794
economic way,
but it's much more dangerous than what 

1154
00:50:03,581 --> 00:50:04,950
the gold plants are doing.
I mean,

1155
00:50:04,960 --> 00:50:06,550
I haven't seen anything to contradict 
that,

1156
00:50:06,880 --> 00:50:08,050
but in the future,
let's say,

1157
00:50:08,051 --> 00:50:08,561
he said,
well,

1158
00:50:08,561 --> 00:50:09,394
what if you had buildings where you had 
affordable technology that could filter 

1159
00:50:12,131 --> 00:50:14,350
all these diseases?
Then you might say,

1160
00:50:14,690 --> 00:50:17,170
you know,
you're required to do this right?

1161
00:50:17,171 --> 00:50:20,140
Or you're required to disclose if your 
building doesn't have this.

1162
00:50:20,380 --> 00:50:21,213
So what?
What is considered a dangerous thing in 

1163
00:50:23,861 --> 00:50:27,890
the future could be considered a normal 
thing in the present.

1164
00:50:27,970 --> 00:50:28,631
Right.
Okay.

1165
00:50:28,631 --> 00:50:29,464
So I want to spend basically the rest of
the time we have here discussing the 

1166
00:50:31,631 --> 00:50:34,810
real underlying issue to all of this,
which is very much related to everything

1167
00:50:34,811 --> 00:50:35,644
I do on this show about free speech and 
the role of government and all this 

1168
00:50:38,591 --> 00:50:41,290
stuff.
So you mentioned Al Gore before and uh,

1169
00:50:41,291 --> 00:50:43,180
you know,
one of my things with Al Gore is that,

1170
00:50:43,181 --> 00:50:43,900
you know,
he's,

1171
00:50:43,900 --> 00:50:44,733
I saw the movie an inconvenient truth.
I really liked it at that w when did 

1172
00:50:47,831 --> 00:50:49,930
that come out?
About 2006.

1173
00:50:49,931 --> 00:50:50,591
Okay.
Really,

1174
00:50:50,591 --> 00:50:52,270
really liked it at the time I thought 
it,

1175
00:50:52,271 --> 00:50:55,270
we woke up some things in me that maybe 
I hadn't thought of before.

1176
00:50:55,670 --> 00:50:57,160
Fast.
Fast forward to what?

1177
00:50:57,161 --> 00:50:57,994
About three years ago,
Al Gore decided to sell current TV to 

1178
00:51:02,500 --> 00:51:03,333
the government of Qatar so they could 
put allergists ear on here and the 

1179
00:51:05,081 --> 00:51:07,950
government card does tons of fun stuff 
with fossil fuels.

1180
00:51:07,950 --> 00:51:10,030
So,
and he basically created the producers.

1181
00:51:10,031 --> 00:51:14,260
He created a failed network and s and 
profited on it for $500 million.

1182
00:51:14,261 --> 00:51:17,890
I mean he did the producers he used,
he leveraged the first one to point this

1183
00:51:17,891 --> 00:51:19,570
out.
I've been saying it for a while.

1184
00:51:19,571 --> 00:51:22,600
I don't know that anyone,
but he's basically a max be all stock.

1185
00:51:22,601 --> 00:51:23,434
Like he created the pretty,
he created a failed network and then 

1186
00:51:26,051 --> 00:51:26,884
ultimately he walked away with a ton of 
money and the reason he was able to 

1187
00:51:29,021 --> 00:51:29,854
create the network was cause he was the 
vice president had all the connections 

1188
00:51:31,811 --> 00:51:32,644
and telecoms and all that stuff.
It's not easy to get on cable channels 

1189
00:51:34,691 --> 00:51:35,524
and all that,
but basically we created a shitty 

1190
00:51:36,401 --> 00:51:37,234
product that he walked away with a ton 
of money and at the same time he took a 

1191
00:51:41,201 --> 00:51:42,034
massive check from the government of 
Qatar who does a ton obviously with 

1192
00:51:45,760 --> 00:51:48,040
fossil fuels that he's always railing 
against.

1193
00:51:48,041 --> 00:51:49,900
So I'm putting that out there that I 
have no,

1194
00:51:49,990 --> 00:51:50,823
I suspect something's not quite right 
with what this guy is doing in the 

1195
00:51:53,531 --> 00:51:54,364
scheme of this thing.
But can you lay out a perhaps more 

1196
00:51:58,050 --> 00:51:58,883
enlightened case than that?
He's just doing the producers because I 

1197
00:52:01,091 --> 00:52:01,924
sensed that

1198
00:52:02,720 --> 00:52:03,400
what?

1199
00:52:03,400 --> 00:52:04,890
Well,
so basically the,

1200
00:52:04,891 --> 00:52:05,724
the federal government right now it 
sounds like is starting to attack think 

1201
00:52:09,791 --> 00:52:10,660
tanks.
Right.

1202
00:52:10,920 --> 00:52:14,830
But they're attacking think tanks that 
do the very work that you do.

1203
00:52:14,831 --> 00:52:15,664
Now I would argue that because I believe
in free speech than a think tank should 

1204
00:52:18,551 --> 00:52:19,384
be allowed to think.
And I don't like governmental control 

1205
00:52:21,611 --> 00:52:22,444
over thought,
even if I completely disagreed with 

1206
00:52:24,551 --> 00:52:26,250
whatever the premise of the think tank 
was knowing.

1207
00:52:26,570 --> 00:52:28,810
Um,
but this is happening right now.

1208
00:52:28,811 --> 00:52:29,644
So first of all,
I guess,

1209
00:52:29,750 --> 00:52:33,340
how is that directly related to Al Gore?
Somehow when the,

1210
00:52:33,470 --> 00:52:35,030
cause he's not part of the government 
anymore.

1211
00:52:35,060 --> 00:52:35,640
Hmm.
Right.

1212
00:52:35,640 --> 00:52:37,890
But he is a figurehead.
I mean he,

1213
00:52:38,340 --> 00:52:40,140
I don't even know what the legality of 
this,

1214
00:52:40,380 --> 00:52:41,213
but when they announced this,
so I guess we should give people a 

1215
00:52:43,510 --> 00:52:48,510
little bit more context there.
So what's happened is over the years,

1216
00:52:49,620 --> 00:52:52,980
what I call the climate catastrophists 
and I just don't want to quickly,

1217
00:52:53,070 --> 00:52:55,090
we haven't talked much about the,
the climate issue specifically.

1218
00:52:55,091 --> 00:52:55,620
I just,
yeah,

1219
00:52:55,620 --> 00:52:57,930
just in terms of my view and other 
people's view,

1220
00:52:58,110 --> 00:53:01,530
there's not this idea of climate 
believers in climate deniers.

1221
00:53:01,531 --> 00:53:04,110
It's a really a dumb old kind of 
alternative.

1222
00:53:04,360 --> 00:53:05,193
But there are different assessments of 
the magnitude of the warming influence 

1223
00:53:09,811 --> 00:53:10,644
of co two.
So we put x amount of co two in the 

1224
00:53:12,271 --> 00:53:13,104
atmosphere.
So let's say 130 parts per million or 

1225
00:53:15,871 --> 00:53:16,704
0.013%
since the beginning of the industrial 

1226
00:53:18,901 --> 00:53:19,734
revolution.
And the question is how much does that 

1227
00:53:21,690 --> 00:53:25,470
affect climate in terms of primarily 
warming then anything that comes warming

1228
00:53:25,710 --> 00:53:26,543
and then how much can it,
it'd be anticipated to affect in the 

1229
00:53:28,411 --> 00:53:29,760
future as we put another point.

1230
00:53:29,760 --> 00:53:32,410
Oh 1% another point.
Oh 1% another point.

1231
00:53:32,411 --> 00:53:33,244
Oh 1%.
And so basically we could go into the 

1232
00:53:34,801 --> 00:53:35,790
details,
but we don't have time.

1233
00:53:36,030 --> 00:53:36,863
Uh,
some people think that that's a very 

1234
00:53:39,841 --> 00:53:42,630
mild and manageable warming.
Uh,

1235
00:53:42,631 --> 00:53:43,464
and they point to things like the amount
of co two in the atmosphere in terms of 

1236
00:53:46,261 --> 00:53:48,680
the geology of the globe is at almost 
record lows.

1237
00:53:48,690 --> 00:53:49,523
Temperatures are at almost record lows.
So in terms of the history of the 

1238
00:53:51,781 --> 00:53:52,614
planet,
when we had 20 times more co two it was 

1239
00:53:54,331 --> 00:53:56,490
a very fertile time.
Two is plant food.

1240
00:53:56,700 --> 00:53:59,650
So what they argue is that CO2 and I 
argue is a,

1241
00:53:59,700 --> 00:54:03,090
has a warming effect,
but it's what's called a decelerating or

1242
00:54:03,091 --> 00:54:05,580
logarithmic effect.
Now that's actually not controversial,

1243
00:54:05,581 --> 00:54:07,200
but then the other side says,
well,

1244
00:54:07,470 --> 00:54:10,830
even though it's a decelerating effect 
in the lab and the atmosphere,

1245
00:54:10,831 --> 00:54:11,664
there are these other dynamics that make
it into this xl accelerating or very 

1246
00:54:15,331 --> 00:54:16,260
dramatic thing.

1247
00:54:16,470 --> 00:54:19,030
And that's why we can expect runaway 
warming.

1248
00:54:19,230 --> 00:54:21,570
Pause there real quick.
So the decelerating meaning that at some

1249
00:54:21,571 --> 00:54:22,404
point,
even though you're putting this stuff 

1250
00:54:23,341 --> 00:54:24,174
out,
eventually start sort of simulating 

1251
00:54:26,970 --> 00:54:27,803
itself,
it's just like a function like 

1252
00:54:29,641 --> 00:54:31,950
diminishing returns.
When you think about like when you press

1253
00:54:31,951 --> 00:54:33,930
the pedal on your gas,
right?

1254
00:54:33,931 --> 00:54:38,310
So at a certain point,
every little push it goes faster to like

1255
00:54:38,311 --> 00:54:39,930
55 and after the go slow,
right?

1256
00:54:39,931 --> 00:54:43,050
Otherwise you'd just take off like a 
rocket and could go forever.

1257
00:54:43,210 --> 00:54:44,040
So it's,
it's,

1258
00:54:44,040 --> 00:54:47,730
it's the same kind of thing.
Every molecule of co two warms less than

1259
00:54:47,731 --> 00:54:49,830
the last.
So this is an uncontroversial scientific

1260
00:54:49,831 --> 00:54:51,030
fact,
which by the way,

1261
00:54:51,031 --> 00:54:54,000
is part of why you need to learn a 
little bit about the science.

1262
00:54:54,060 --> 00:54:57,270
You just have to ask people.
The key thing is what's demonstrated and

1263
00:54:57,271 --> 00:54:58,104
what's speculated.
So this phenomenon of CO2 has 

1264
00:54:59,821 --> 00:55:01,140
demonstrated,
but again,

1265
00:55:01,141 --> 00:55:03,090
there's this other set of theories 
which,

1266
00:55:03,130 --> 00:55:04,850
uh,
I think are very speculative,

1267
00:55:04,890 --> 00:55:05,723
certainly not proven,
but have to do with catastrophic 

1268
00:55:07,801 --> 00:55:08,310
warming.

1269
00:55:08,310 --> 00:55:10,440
But other people are allowed to have 
those theories.

1270
00:55:10,470 --> 00:55:11,303
I don't want to suppress the theories.
I think upon examination there very 

1271
00:55:13,921 --> 00:55:14,754
dubious and whatever they are,
you have to look at them in the context 

1272
00:55:17,461 --> 00:55:18,294
of the benefits of fossil fuels to,
you always have to look at the big 

1273
00:55:20,191 --> 00:55:22,530
picture no matter what.
But basically what I call the,

1274
00:55:22,670 --> 00:55:24,840
so I'm calling them the catastrophists.
So it's not,

1275
00:55:24,990 --> 00:55:26,440
that's why I call them the 
catastrophists.

1276
00:55:26,441 --> 00:55:29,450
So it's not a nonbeliever,
I just believe in mild.

1277
00:55:29,550 --> 00:55:30,361
Okay.
So that,

1278
00:55:30,361 --> 00:55:33,750
that's just the distinction.
So basically what the catastrophist have

1279
00:55:33,751 --> 00:55:34,584
had is what they consider failure.
Now I consider them enormously 

1280
00:55:37,171 --> 00:55:40,800
successful on their own terms because I 
think they've indoctrinated,

1281
00:55:41,040 --> 00:55:42,030
you know,
the whole world.

1282
00:55:42,340 --> 00:55:44,700
Uh,
and hadn't passed a lot of bad policies,

1283
00:55:44,940 --> 00:55:45,773
but on their terms,
they have not shut down the fossil fuel 

1284
00:55:47,941 --> 00:55:48,511
industry.
I mean,

1285
00:55:48,511 --> 00:55:51,420
they want to shut down 80% of it in the 
next 30 years,

1286
00:55:51,421 --> 00:55:52,440
the next 35 years.

1287
00:55:52,770 --> 00:55:55,410
They're not accomplishing that.
They tried to pass cap and trade.

1288
00:55:55,530 --> 00:55:57,270
So what they've done over the past 
several years,

1289
00:55:57,420 --> 00:55:58,253
their basic premises,
well the reason we haven't done this 

1290
00:55:59,831 --> 00:56:03,240
because people are idiots and there must
be some villain who's causing this.

1291
00:56:03,241 --> 00:56:04,830
So of course,
who is the villain?

1292
00:56:05,160 --> 00:56:05,993
Big Oil,
who's allegedly forcing us to buy oil 

1293
00:56:08,101 --> 00:56:10,560
when in fact we basically ask them to 
produce the old,

1294
00:56:10,980 --> 00:56:11,910
right.
So,

1295
00:56:12,150 --> 00:56:12,983
but so what they did,
they have this thing called the 

1296
00:56:13,861 --> 00:56:14,694
divestment movement,
which is basically sell all of your oil 

1297
00:56:16,351 --> 00:56:18,840
stock and that'll demonize them and 
everyone will hate them and then they'll

1298
00:56:18,841 --> 00:56:21,000
vote against him.
So mad hasn't worked so well so far.

1299
00:56:21,150 --> 00:56:24,700
So now what they have is,
is the government actually prosecuting,

1300
00:56:24,701 --> 00:56:28,630
I would argue persecuting the company.
So different attorney to General.

1301
00:56:28,631 --> 00:56:29,021
So,
you know,

1302
00:56:29,021 --> 00:56:31,570
each state has an attorney general and 
what they're doing,

1303
00:56:31,571 --> 00:56:32,404
they're going after the biggest and 
allegedly baddest Exxon Mobil and the 

1304
00:56:36,281 --> 00:56:39,130
attorney generals are saying basically,
Exxon,

1305
00:56:39,131 --> 00:56:39,964
you over the years have not expressed 
what we believe are the proper climate 

1306
00:56:43,481 --> 00:56:44,560
catastrophists views.

1307
00:56:44,890 --> 00:56:47,440
And in fact you have funded people who 
don't have those views.

1308
00:56:47,770 --> 00:56:49,300
So if you just said that,
you'd think,

1309
00:56:49,301 --> 00:56:50,380
oh,
well you're allowed to do that,

1310
00:56:50,381 --> 00:56:51,430
right?
This is America.

1311
00:56:51,431 --> 00:56:52,264
You're free.
But what they've done is they've called 

1312
00:56:53,861 --> 00:56:55,110
it fraud,
right?

1313
00:56:55,111 --> 00:56:59,740
They said you've defrauded,
but for many reasons it's not fraud.

1314
00:56:59,741 --> 00:57:01,270
And the basic thing is for it to be 
fraud,

1315
00:57:01,271 --> 00:57:02,104
you have to misrepresent specific facts.
Fraud is not expect expressing a wrong 

1316
00:57:05,351 --> 00:57:08,140
opinion or even a wrong opinion that 
serves you.

1317
00:57:08,141 --> 00:57:11,620
Companies do that all the time.
It's misrepresenting specific facts that

1318
00:57:11,621 --> 00:57:15,310
you have specific access to right now.
The biggest tension really.

1319
00:57:15,790 --> 00:57:16,431
Well,
but it,

1320
00:57:16,431 --> 00:57:16,940
but,
but it,

1321
00:57:16,940 --> 00:57:18,920
it's a specific thing like you have to 
misrepresent.

1322
00:57:18,940 --> 00:57:21,610
So let's say Exxon selling a kind of a 
certain kind of gasoline,

1323
00:57:21,970 --> 00:57:24,040
then they misrepresent the contents of 
that.

1324
00:57:24,070 --> 00:57:24,903
That's fraud.
But they didn't misrepresent the fact 

1325
00:57:26,771 --> 00:57:29,470
that gasoline admits CO2 when you burn 
it.

1326
00:57:29,500 --> 00:57:30,850
Everybody knows that.
Right?

1327
00:57:30,851 --> 00:57:34,120
And the experts on that were mostly 
government scientist.

1328
00:57:34,121 --> 00:57:36,850
So Exxon didn't,
you have an ability to defrauded anyone.

1329
00:57:36,851 --> 00:57:40,840
It had an ability to express opinions 
and to fund people or be affiliated with

1330
00:57:40,841 --> 00:57:42,040
people,
express different opinions.

1331
00:57:42,041 --> 00:57:44,800
So what happened then is the government 
subpoenaed Exxon,

1332
00:57:44,801 --> 00:57:45,634
different people subpoenaed Exxon,
but they also started going after think 

1333
00:57:47,921 --> 00:57:50,920
tanks that they suspected might be 
connected with Exxon.

1334
00:57:51,220 --> 00:57:54,190
And several wednesdays ago they came 
after me,

1335
00:57:54,191 --> 00:57:57,670
or at least I was named in a subpoena,
which means the government has any right

1336
00:57:57,671 --> 00:57:58,504
at once to records of any emails between
anyone at my company and anyone at 

1337
00:58:02,591 --> 00:58:03,670
Exxon.
So that,

1338
00:58:03,671 --> 00:58:05,620
and my views is a complete violation of 
my rights.

1339
00:58:05,710 --> 00:58:06,543
And in my case,
it's interesting because I don't run a 

1340
00:58:07,990 --> 00:58:08,823
nonprofit.
I don't run a company that accepts 

1341
00:58:09,941 --> 00:58:12,250
donations are a for profit company,
sell books.

1342
00:58:12,251 --> 00:58:13,420
I sell lectures,
right?

1343
00:58:13,421 --> 00:58:14,254
So there's no plausibility that Exxon is
sort of paying me to do something and 

1344
00:58:18,101 --> 00:58:19,900
they went after me.
So why did they go after me?

1345
00:58:20,110 --> 00:58:22,930
Because I have a prominent book called 
the moral case for fossil fuels.

1346
00:58:22,960 --> 00:58:26,080
So what they're saying to me is,
and what they're saying to me is,

1347
00:58:26,081 --> 00:58:26,914
Alex,
because you expressed an opinion we 

1348
00:58:27,941 --> 00:58:28,774
disagree with,
we are going to invade your life and 

1349
00:58:32,081 --> 00:58:33,050
people are afraid of that.

1350
00:58:33,120 --> 00:58:33,953
So how are they actually coming at like 
what are they trying to do to you as a 

1351
00:58:37,831 --> 00:58:40,770
for profit business?
So I get what they can try to do with,

1352
00:58:40,830 --> 00:58:41,551
with Exxon,
right?

1353
00:58:41,551 --> 00:58:42,384
They can ultimately legislate things 
that would allow Exxon to not do 

1354
00:58:45,301 --> 00:58:48,990
business the way it seems to be 
legislating their prosecutor prosecuting

1355
00:58:48,991 --> 00:58:50,010
people in jail.
Right.

1356
00:58:50,011 --> 00:58:50,610
Okay.
So,

1357
00:58:50,610 --> 00:58:51,750
okay,
so I understand that.

1358
00:58:51,840 --> 00:58:54,590
But at what can they do to you as well?
I guess it's the same thing.

1359
00:58:54,660 --> 00:58:56,060
Competitive of Enterprise Institute.

1360
00:58:56,380 --> 00:58:57,213
Uh,
at least for a while they were going 

1361
00:58:57,891 --> 00:59:00,740
after that organization.
So they're going after that organization

1362
00:59:00,741 --> 00:59:01,574
as a party to it because of Exxon is 
committing fraud than the people who 

1363
00:59:04,701 --> 00:59:05,534
help.
It can be considered a party to that 

1364
00:59:07,401 --> 00:59:09,620
fraud.
But you see that the core issue,

1365
00:59:09,650 --> 00:59:13,790
I just think my case brings out that the
core issue is expressing an opinion that

1366
00:59:13,791 --> 00:59:15,830
the government disagrees with.
So,

1367
00:59:16,430 --> 00:59:18,580
uh,
I mean it just goes against just a,

1368
00:59:18,590 --> 00:59:19,423
you know,
a fundamental principle of progress is 

1369
00:59:21,350 --> 00:59:22,183
speech because we can't make progress 
without having the freedom to discuss 

1370
00:59:25,221 --> 00:59:28,310
ideas and debate ideas and have 
intellectual clarity.

1371
00:59:28,760 --> 00:59:32,930
And so for this to happen is,
is really horrible.

1372
00:59:32,931 --> 00:59:35,130
And I think I'm in a position where,
because I was,

1373
00:59:35,131 --> 00:59:37,460
I was only named on the Sabine,
I wasn't subpoenaed now,

1374
00:59:37,461 --> 00:59:40,040
I couldn't be in the future.
But right now I'm,

1375
00:59:40,730 --> 00:59:42,530
I have a lot of latitude to speak out.

1376
00:59:42,530 --> 00:59:45,620
I have 100% ownership of my company.
I don't know if shareholders,

1377
00:59:45,621 --> 00:59:48,290
I don't have donors,
so I'm not accountable to anybody.

1378
00:59:48,410 --> 00:59:49,243
So I have an ability to,
to be very vocal about this issue now 

1379
00:59:52,491 --> 00:59:53,324
and I'm taking advantage of it,
hopefully to preempt them from doing 

1380
00:59:56,001 --> 00:59:59,450
something more in the future.
I saw that they did some attack recently

1381
00:59:59,451 --> 01:00:01,700
and I wasn't named in it.
I don't know if that was a coincidence,

1382
01:00:02,170 --> 01:00:03,003
but I defend,
I just wanted to make clear by defend 

1383
01:00:04,640 --> 01:00:05,473
Exxon's right to express its opinion.
I actually think it's been when it's 

1384
01:00:08,091 --> 01:00:10,430
given way more money to climate 
catastrophist,

1385
01:00:10,790 --> 01:00:12,230
uh,
than it has to,

1386
01:00:12,560 --> 01:00:15,230
I would say climate thinkers,
which I would call myself A.

1387
01:00:15,231 --> 01:00:17,360
I think in general they've been way too 
sympathetic.

1388
01:00:17,361 --> 01:00:20,090
They just came out in favor of a tax on 
co two.

1389
01:00:20,091 --> 01:00:20,924
They've been promoting that.
So I think their policies are wrong in 

1390
01:00:22,821 --> 01:00:23,654
the wrong direction,
but they can say anything they want in 

1391
01:00:25,501 --> 01:00:26,334
certain,

1392
01:00:26,520 --> 01:00:30,390
given too much away.
I know out of guilt sort of or whatever.

1393
01:00:30,810 --> 01:00:35,460
What prompts you to anti humanist?
100 million guilted them into doing more

1394
01:00:35,461 --> 01:00:38,970
than you would argue they should have 
done because you guys obviously none.

1395
01:00:39,520 --> 01:00:40,353
I mean they should have done none,
but particularly given the balance of 

1396
01:00:42,781 --> 01:00:43,614
funding already.
I mean you're talking orders of 

1397
01:00:44,881 --> 01:00:45,714
magnitude different amounts of funding 
for the catastrophists versus any kind 

1398
01:00:49,111 --> 01:00:52,910
of advocate of fossil fuels,
but they gave $100 million to Stanford's

1399
01:00:52,920 --> 01:00:53,753
climate program,
$100 million for every calculation I've 

1400
01:00:55,921 --> 01:00:56,754
seen.
That's a way more than they've given to 

1401
01:00:57,361 --> 01:00:58,194
anyone else.
So this,

1402
01:00:58,500 --> 01:00:59,670
you know,
these think tanks,

1403
01:00:59,850 --> 01:01:02,010
these nonprofits,
I mean,

1404
01:01:02,011 --> 01:01:04,200
I really admire a lot of them.
I met a lot of the people,

1405
01:01:04,230 --> 01:01:05,063
I think they were really sincere and 
they have a hell of a time getting 

1406
01:01:07,081 --> 01:01:09,360
funding from any of these,
these companies.

1407
01:01:09,361 --> 01:01:11,550
I think the company should give them,
I don't need money.

1408
01:01:11,551 --> 01:01:12,384
I have a different kind of business,
but I think they should be giving a lot 

1409
01:01:13,771 --> 01:01:17,760
more money to fund opposition research.
And that's a fundamental thing in a free

1410
01:01:17,761 --> 01:01:21,840
society and a one key function of 
industry is to,

1411
01:01:21,870 --> 01:01:24,930
if the industry is being attacked,
it should fund opposition,

1412
01:01:25,580 --> 01:01:25,950
right?

1413
01:01:25,950 --> 01:01:27,240
I mean it's,
it's even like,

1414
01:01:27,241 --> 01:01:28,021
um,
now,

1415
01:01:28,021 --> 01:01:29,880
so if you even take the tobacco 
industry,

1416
01:01:30,030 --> 01:01:32,070
the tobacco should,
should fund research.

1417
01:01:32,340 --> 01:01:36,600
What it shouldn't do is misrepresent and
a lie about the researcher fund fraud.

1418
01:01:36,900 --> 01:01:37,860
But,
um,

1419
01:01:38,280 --> 01:01:39,001
you know,
if somebody,

1420
01:01:39,001 --> 01:01:39,834
let's say somebody was exaggerated,
I don't know anything about tobacco 

1421
01:01:41,341 --> 01:01:42,210
really,
I never spoke,

1422
01:01:42,240 --> 01:01:45,960
but like let's say somebody was 
exaggerating by a factor of four,

1423
01:01:46,170 --> 01:01:49,320
the damages of tobacco and you wanted to
do research,

1424
01:01:49,680 --> 01:01:51,390
um,
that would be legitimate.

1425
01:01:51,391 --> 01:01:52,224
So what my point is in a free society,
you should be able to talk about 

1426
01:01:54,181 --> 01:01:57,510
anything you want the eye.
This isn't a marginal case.

1427
01:01:57,900 --> 01:02:01,590
This is a completely normal thing for 
people to be able to talk about.

1428
01:02:02,010 --> 01:02:04,740
And it's really scary that,
that,

1429
01:02:05,520 --> 01:02:06,810
that,
that people thinks is,

1430
01:02:06,820 --> 01:02:07,653
okay,
this is on the democratic proposed 

1431
01:02:08,821 --> 01:02:10,020
platform.
All hurt,

1432
01:02:10,230 --> 01:02:14,190
Hillary Clinton has to do with sign and 
this is part of their platform that,

1433
01:02:14,220 --> 01:02:15,053
and,
and what kind of stupid platform is it 

1434
01:02:16,291 --> 01:02:20,630
to tell the executive branch to go out 
the pro form source.

1435
01:02:20,640 --> 01:02:22,200
We legislative.
So it's just bizarre.

1436
01:02:22,201 --> 01:02:26,040
But they're telling the executive branch
to go after specific companies.

1437
01:02:26,041 --> 01:02:27,030
That's their platform.

1438
01:02:27,920 --> 01:02:29,300
Yeah.
That's a whole other topic.

1439
01:02:30,170 --> 01:02:32,650
What's going on with politics or 
aggressive?

1440
01:02:32,680 --> 01:02:33,790
It's,
it's the regressives.

1441
01:02:33,791 --> 01:02:34,191
Yeah.
Wow.

1442
01:02:34,191 --> 01:02:36,380
I almost got through a show without 
saying regressives there you go.

1443
01:02:36,381 --> 01:02:37,214
But so that,
I guess what's happening here is that 

1444
01:02:39,651 --> 01:02:40,484
there's some,
there's sort of a bigger cultural thing 

1445
01:02:41,541 --> 01:02:42,374
here,
so you were talking about this and 

1446
01:02:43,161 --> 01:02:45,110
through the lens of fossil fuels and all
that stuff,

1447
01:02:45,380 --> 01:02:48,560
but there's just a sort of bigger thing,
which is what I've really made this show

1448
01:02:48,561 --> 01:02:49,394
about,
which is just about free speech and 

1449
01:02:50,601 --> 01:02:51,434
that's why I keep talking about it so 
much because I think people don't 

1450
01:02:53,151 --> 01:02:54,230
realize,
again,

1451
01:02:54,470 --> 01:02:55,303
regardless of what you think about 
climate change and fossil fuels and 

1452
01:02:58,940 --> 01:03:01,190
everything else that you've said here,
that the,

1453
01:03:01,220 --> 01:03:04,370
that the real linchpin here is the free 
speech stuff.

1454
01:03:04,610 --> 01:03:06,170
And I keep saying that.
I don't fear it,

1455
01:03:06,260 --> 01:03:07,093
the government coming lately,
I fear that we're taking away from 

1456
01:03:08,931 --> 01:03:11,000
ourselves.
But you're laying out a pretty good case

1457
01:03:11,210 --> 01:03:12,820
on the government side.
So that's even,

1458
01:03:12,821 --> 01:03:13,654
yeah,

1459
01:03:13,700 --> 01:03:15,750
I mean I imagine you're talking about 
like these,

1460
01:03:16,170 --> 01:03:19,440
these comfort zones and safe spaces and 
the trigger warning

1461
01:03:20,100 --> 01:03:21,840
and self censorship that we're doing 
really well.

1462
01:03:22,040 --> 01:03:26,180
I mean,
I graduated Duke in 2002 and it wasn't,

1463
01:03:26,181 --> 01:03:27,770
I mean it was bad then,
but it wasn't,

1464
01:03:27,771 --> 01:03:28,604
I mean I'm actually almost got kicked 
out of Duke for yelling at a guest 

1465
01:03:31,461 --> 01:03:32,294
environmentalist speaker,
but in general there weren't even those 

1466
01:03:34,641 --> 01:03:38,090
terms said that this idea of thought 
control the,

1467
01:03:38,120 --> 01:03:38,953
I think there's a relationship even even
sort of private thought control that's 

1468
01:03:41,901 --> 01:03:42,734
not directly coercive,
but where you basically make everybody 

1469
01:03:45,830 --> 01:03:48,770
afraid to say anything about any 
controversial topic.

1470
01:03:49,040 --> 01:03:49,873
My guess is that makes people very 
comfortable with government thought 

1471
01:03:53,301 --> 01:03:54,120
control.

1472
01:03:54,120 --> 01:03:55,170
Oh,
that's interesting.

1473
01:03:55,230 --> 01:03:56,220
That's interesting.
All right,

1474
01:03:56,221 --> 01:03:56,880
so,
uh,

1475
01:03:56,880 --> 01:03:59,100
we got to wrap up,
but what would be,

1476
01:03:59,440 --> 01:04:00,273
give me your like one minute sort of if 
you wanted people that have heard this 

1477
01:04:04,231 --> 01:04:05,041
and that.
I've said,

1478
01:04:05,041 --> 01:04:07,260
all right,
I never bought into any of this stuff,

1479
01:04:07,261 --> 01:04:08,280
but I,
you know,

1480
01:04:08,281 --> 01:04:10,050
I like some of this with this guy.
He said,

1481
01:04:10,320 --> 01:04:11,153
what's the one minute push that you can 
give them to explore this a little bit 

1482
01:04:13,981 --> 01:04:16,890
more beyond buying my book,
which I'm going to talk about when I say

1483
01:04:16,891 --> 01:04:17,220
goodbye.

1484
01:04:17,220 --> 01:04:18,150
Yes,
it's an issue.

1485
01:04:18,151 --> 01:04:20,040
I usually bring up more.
So I want,

1486
01:04:20,041 --> 01:04:20,880
I'll,
I'll say this,

1487
01:04:21,540 --> 01:04:24,990
whenever we look at any issue in life,
we're,

1488
01:04:25,020 --> 01:04:25,853
we are implicitly or explicitly saying 
this is good because I define good this 

1489
01:04:30,421 --> 01:04:33,060
way.
We always have an implicit definition of

1490
01:04:33,061 --> 01:04:33,894
good,
whether we're talking about climate or 

1491
01:04:34,471 --> 01:04:37,080
fossil fuels or free speech or whatever.
And so my,

1492
01:04:37,081 --> 01:04:37,914
what I call my standard of value is 
always I want to maximize human 

1493
01:04:41,431 --> 01:04:44,160
flourishing.
And I think in our culture today,

1494
01:04:44,161 --> 01:04:47,070
the standard of value or were taught 
particularly with environmental issues,

1495
01:04:47,400 --> 01:04:50,340
is we want to minimize human impact on 
the planet.

1496
01:04:50,400 --> 01:04:53,220
So I want people to think whenever they 
run into these issues,

1497
01:04:53,221 --> 01:04:54,450
ask,
ask themselves,

1498
01:04:54,690 --> 01:04:58,830
is this thinker on the premise of 
maximum human flourishing or are they on

1499
01:04:58,831 --> 01:05:01,770
the premise of minimum human impact?
And I think when you look at things,

1500
01:05:02,100 --> 01:05:05,850
whether it's organic food or GMO or 
climate,

1501
01:05:05,851 --> 01:05:08,670
you'll see a lot of that minimum impact 
is the ideal.

1502
01:05:09,060 --> 01:05:12,060
And I think that completely contradicts 
maximizing human wellbeing.

1503
01:05:12,061 --> 01:05:15,330
So if you want to maximize flourishing,
you want to maximize,

1504
01:05:15,360 --> 01:05:16,193
you want to minimize negative impacts,
but you want to maximize positive 

1505
01:05:18,251 --> 01:05:20,230
impacts.
I think that's a great filter to look at

1506
01:05:20,231 --> 01:05:20,880
life through.

1507
01:05:20,880 --> 01:05:21,580
Yeah.
Uh,

1508
01:05:21,580 --> 01:05:23,760
that's a perfect closing,
but I should mention that you said to me

1509
01:05:23,761 --> 01:05:25,800
right before we started that one of my 
former guests,

1510
01:05:25,801 --> 01:05:26,634
Michael Mann,
who is a climate scientist I think at 

1511
01:05:27,631 --> 01:05:29,340
Penn State Penn state or am I right?
Yeah.

1512
01:05:29,490 --> 01:05:31,110
Uh,
that he uh,

1513
01:05:31,190 --> 01:05:32,023
he's blocked you on twitter,
which I guess goes to a little bit of 

1514
01:05:33,991 --> 01:05:38,940
just how contentious this whole thing is
because you on musk is black to you too.

1515
01:05:39,030 --> 01:05:42,070
I mean w w w what was interesting about 
Michael Mann,

1516
01:05:42,090 --> 01:05:44,620
I'd say when,
when watch Michael man speak,

1517
01:05:44,621 --> 01:05:47,280
I encourage anyone to watch any of his 
lectures.

1518
01:05:47,290 --> 01:05:48,880
I haven't seen your interview,
but I've seen his lectures.

1519
01:05:50,320 --> 01:05:51,153
We'll get the precision or non precision
about the issue of what is demonstrated 

1520
01:05:54,791 --> 01:05:55,624
versus what is speculated.
Because what they tend to do is they'll 

1521
01:05:57,821 --> 01:05:58,654
say something trivial like co two warms,
which everyone agrees with and it'll 

1522
01:06:01,480 --> 01:06:04,900
jump into therefore it's catastrophic.
So just look at,

1523
01:06:05,020 --> 01:06:07,560
is Michael Mann really respecting your 
mind?

1524
01:06:07,561 --> 01:06:08,394
Is He really explaining things with the 
degree of precision that would be 

1525
01:06:10,721 --> 01:06:12,640
necessary for you to really understand 
the topic?

1526
01:06:12,641 --> 01:06:14,110
I'm not,
I'm not asking you to take a position.

1527
01:06:14,111 --> 01:06:16,090
I'm just saying that people should think
about that.

1528
01:06:16,240 --> 01:06:18,250
And one indication is how they deal with
debate.

1529
01:06:18,251 --> 01:06:20,050
Now people can,
I don't block people,

1530
01:06:20,210 --> 01:06:22,210
other people that they can have their 
policy.

1531
01:06:22,330 --> 01:06:27,220
But Michael Mann wrote a post that said,
Alex Epstein is the Koch Brothers attack

1532
01:06:27,221 --> 01:06:30,640
dog,
which wouldn't be a negative thing in my

1533
01:06:30,641 --> 01:06:32,650
view,
but it was bizarre.

1534
01:06:32,710 --> 01:06:34,990
I mean,
it's not true and nobody's funding me at

1535
01:06:34,991 --> 01:06:36,160
all.
Um,

1536
01:06:36,220 --> 01:06:39,340
and he just made it up.
He just completely made it up.

1537
01:06:39,370 --> 01:06:40,203
The idea what he didn't engage my 
argument and then I said something to 

1538
01:06:43,361 --> 01:06:46,660
the effect of this is a lie.
What is your evidence?

1539
01:06:46,870 --> 01:06:48,290
And then he blocked you.
Yeah.

1540
01:06:48,370 --> 01:06:49,203
So it's,
it's what you see there is that when 

1541
01:06:51,190 --> 01:06:52,840
people,
so there are two types of,

1542
01:06:52,841 --> 01:06:53,674
I think having the moral high ground.
One is when you have a real confidence 

1543
01:06:56,590 --> 01:06:59,170
and that's when you're willing to 
explain your views to people.

1544
01:06:59,410 --> 01:07:00,243
And the others where you have a certain 
societal status where it's not really 

1545
01:07:03,190 --> 01:07:04,023
earned,
but it's considered you dominate the 

1546
01:07:06,251 --> 01:07:08,070
politically correct version.
Uh,

1547
01:07:08,370 --> 01:07:09,203
uh,
you have the political correctness at 

1548
01:07:10,781 --> 01:07:13,030
this point in time in society.

1549
01:07:13,300 --> 01:07:15,820
And when people have that kind of pseudo
moral authority,

1550
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:19,810
they do all sorts of irrational things.
So when somebody acts like they have the

1551
01:07:19,811 --> 01:07:20,644
moral high ground,
I think seeing if they're really a 

1552
01:07:22,211 --> 01:07:26,230
debater or whether they just want to 
dictate to you that's or,

1553
01:07:26,231 --> 01:07:28,060
or ignore you,
that's a really good test.

1554
01:07:28,061 --> 01:07:29,400
I think it's a good,
you know,

1555
01:07:29,440 --> 01:07:32,350
one of the reasons why people really 
value this show is,

1556
01:07:32,351 --> 01:07:34,540
you know,
you're not an unconfident gile though.

1557
01:07:34,580 --> 01:07:36,070
You know,
you're interviewing people,

1558
01:07:36,400 --> 01:07:37,330
but it's,
you know,

1559
01:07:37,331 --> 01:07:41,260
there's a certain confidence and being 
willing to discuss things with anyone.

1560
01:07:41,261 --> 01:07:43,690
And there's a certain,
it's very reveleigh Tori,

1561
01:07:43,930 --> 01:07:44,763
when people are not willing to discuss 
things and their number one talking 

1562
01:07:47,231 --> 01:07:48,680
point is there's nothing to discuss.

1563
01:07:49,600 --> 01:07:50,240
Right.
Well,

1564
01:07:50,240 --> 01:07:52,560
I always find it funny.
It's that I never felt,

1565
01:07:52,561 --> 01:07:55,080
I've never in my life felt the need to 
be right all the time.

1566
01:07:55,320 --> 01:07:56,153
And everyone I feel in the public space 
always wants to prove how right they 

1567
01:07:59,011 --> 01:07:59,844
are.
So I'm completely fine having this 

1568
01:08:01,771 --> 01:08:02,604
conversation and maybe I would look back
now on my interview with Michael Mann 

1569
01:08:05,491 --> 01:08:06,324
and sort of look at through,
through a bit of a lens of what you've 

1570
01:08:08,401 --> 01:08:09,234
just said there and maybe a,
if I have him on again where I would 

1571
01:08:10,711 --> 01:08:11,970
push him on some of those things.
All right,

1572
01:08:11,971 --> 01:08:14,310
well that's the conversation I want to 
have and that's why we did it.

1573
01:08:14,311 --> 01:08:15,144
So you can get Alex's book,
the moral case for fossil fuels and 

1574
01:08:19,791 --> 01:08:20,624
check out industrial progress.com
the link for the book is right down 

1575
01:08:23,271 --> 01:08:24,440
below.
Thanks for watching.

1576
01:08:24,470 --> 01:08:25,550
And we'll do it again next week.
