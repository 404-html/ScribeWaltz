1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:01,500
Hey guys,
Dave Rubin here.

2
00:00:01,501 --> 00:00:03,390
That's right.
I'm still a Dave Rubin.

3
00:00:03,391 --> 00:00:05,310
This is Rubin report.
As you guys know,

4
00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:09,420
we are making the move to Aura TV.
They are building meet an.

5
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:10,333
An unbelievable set right now,
so Larry King was nice enough to let me 

6
00:00:14,101 --> 00:00:14,934
use his studio today and the reason we 
wanted to do some stuff with you guys 

7
00:00:18,301 --> 00:00:21,450
today is because I have Dr.
Gad Saad here.

8
00:00:21,451 --> 00:00:22,284
He is,
professor of marketing at Concordia 

9
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:25,673
University in Montreal,
Canada and he's the research chair in 

10
00:00:27,690 --> 00:00:32,490
evolutionary behavioral sciences and 
Darwinian consumption.

11
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:35,830
I normally don't use a teleprompter,
but I needed it for that get.

12
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:36,930
How are you?
Very good.

13
00:00:36,931 --> 00:00:37,770
Yourself?
Good.

14
00:00:37,771 --> 00:00:38,200
Good.
How?

15
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:39,033
First off Gad said,
how is my pronunciation of your last 

16
00:00:41,611 --> 00:00:42,444
name is Arabic and Arabic as well?
God is a Hebrew name and sad as an 

17
00:00:47,821 --> 00:00:48,654
Arabic name,
but most people can't say the guttural 

18
00:00:50,611 --> 00:00:52,810
sounds and so it just gets an extended 
ace.

19
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:54,000
I'm sad.
Well,

20
00:00:54,001 --> 00:00:57,430
I've heard you do it on your own videos 
on youtube and you don't even do it with

21
00:00:57,431 --> 00:00:59,830
the guttural sound because I don't want 
to intimidate the viewers.

22
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:03,950
That sound so a Hebrew first name Arabic
last night.

23
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:05,490
That's right.
So you must be very conflicted.

24
00:01:05,910 --> 00:01:06,750
I'm not,
I'm not.

25
00:01:06,751 --> 00:01:10,110
I'm from Lebanon,
but of the Jewish faith.

26
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:12,510
Okay.
So the reason that I wanted to bring you

27
00:01:12,511 --> 00:01:15,330
in and the timing of this really is just
perfect,

28
00:01:15,570 --> 00:01:16,403
uh,
is because we connected sort of in the 

29
00:01:19,260 --> 00:01:20,093
last year and a half or so on twitter.
We find ourselves often in the same 

30
00:01:22,321 --> 00:01:24,300
twitter wars with people,
uh,

31
00:01:24,301 --> 00:01:25,134
the atheists and the new atheists and 
the far left and the people on the 

32
00:01:27,931 --> 00:01:28,764
right.
And everyone that's always battling on 

33
00:01:29,461 --> 00:01:31,320
twitter and we're usually on the same 
side.

34
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:34,020
Right?
And really what started this whole thing

35
00:01:34,021 --> 00:01:34,854
was when Sam Harris was on real time 
with Bill Maher and he and Ben Affleck 

36
00:01:40,591 --> 00:01:41,424
and bill got into a big frack is a.
So let's take a look at the clip and 

37
00:01:44,041 --> 00:01:44,940
then we'll go from there.
Sure.

38
00:01:45,190 --> 00:01:46,023
So the other thing,
we want to talk about the courses that 

39
00:01:47,321 --> 00:01:49,210
you and I have been trying to make the 
case.

40
00:01:49,211 --> 00:01:54,190
I think I have any way that liberals 
need to stand up for liberal principles.

41
00:01:54,220 --> 00:01:55,780
This is what I stood on last week's 
show.

42
00:01:55,781 --> 00:01:56,614
Obviously I got a lot of hate for it,
but all I'm saying is that liberal 

43
00:01:59,861 --> 00:02:00,694
principles like freedom of speech,
freedom to practice any religion you 

44
00:02:03,611 --> 00:02:07,150
want without fear of violence,
freedom to leave a religion,

45
00:02:07,210 --> 00:02:10,630
equality for women,
a quality for minorities,

46
00:02:10,631 --> 00:02:12,770
including homosexuals.
These are bit

47
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:16,510
principles,
applaud for,

48
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:19,010
but then when you done

49
00:02:19,010 --> 00:02:21,860
say in the Muslim world,
this is what's lacking,

50
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:23,210
then they get upset.

51
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:24,041
Yeah,
yeah.

52
00:02:24,041 --> 00:02:27,940
Well,
liberals have really failed on the topic

53
00:02:27,941 --> 00:02:31,120
of theocracy that they'll criticize 
white theocracy.

54
00:02:31,130 --> 00:02:31,963
They'll criticize Christians,
they'll still get agitated over the 

55
00:02:36,161 --> 00:02:38,560
abortion clinic bombing that happened in
1984,

56
00:02:38,860 --> 00:02:39,693
but when,
when you want to talk about the 

57
00:02:41,411 --> 00:02:42,244
treatment of women and homosexuals and 
free thinkers and public intellectuals 

58
00:02:45,581 --> 00:02:46,414
in the Muslim world,
I would argue that the liberals have 

59
00:02:48,491 --> 00:02:51,070
failed us and the crucial point

60
00:02:51,170 --> 00:02:52,200
confusion.
Yeah.

61
00:02:52,710 --> 00:02:54,740
Thank God you're here.
I mean,

62
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:57,070
the crucial point of confusion is is

63
00:02:57,080 --> 00:02:57,913
that that we have been sold this meme of
Islamophobia where every criticism of 

64
00:03:03,251 --> 00:03:07,870
the doctrine of Islam gets conflated 
with bigotry toward Muslims as people.

65
00:03:08,170 --> 00:03:11,830
That is intellectually ridiculous.
Even.

66
00:03:11,870 --> 00:03:12,703
It gets so hold on who that person who 
understands the officially codified 

67
00:03:15,431 --> 00:03:18,050
doctrine of Islam.
You say,

68
00:03:18,070 --> 00:03:18,903
well,
this is actually well educated on this 

69
00:03:20,501 --> 00:03:21,450
topic.
I'm asking you.

70
00:03:21,580 --> 00:03:24,610
You're saying if I criticize the.
You're saying that Islamophobia is not a

71
00:03:24,611 --> 00:03:26,830
real thing,
that if you're critical of something,

72
00:03:27,010 --> 00:03:28,920
it's not a real thing when we do it.
Right.

73
00:03:30,050 --> 00:03:32,530
It's really is.
I'm not denying that that certain people

74
00:03:32,531 --> 00:03:35,730
are bigoted against Muslims as people 
and that's a problem big have you.

75
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:40,800
But the gross,
it's racist and it's not.

76
00:03:41,290 --> 00:03:42,340
It's but it's so.
It's.

77
00:03:42,341 --> 00:03:44,750
So.
It's like saying those years shifty.

78
00:03:44,830 --> 00:03:48,610
You're absolutely not.
We are saying you guys are saying if you

79
00:03:48,611 --> 00:03:50,350
want to be liberals believe in liberal 
principles,

80
00:03:50,351 --> 00:03:51,280
rights,
freedom of speech,

81
00:03:51,281 --> 00:03:54,400
like you know,
we are endowed by our forefathers of the

82
00:03:54,401 --> 00:03:56,170
low trek.
All men are created new fan.

83
00:03:56,171 --> 00:03:57,930
We have to be able to criticize bad 
ideas.

84
00:03:58,980 --> 00:03:59,813
Okay,
so that clip goes on for about 10 

85
00:04:01,141 --> 00:04:01,974
minutes and I showed you about two 
minutes right there and I think Sam hit 

86
00:04:04,921 --> 00:04:08,490
the point right at the end that we have 
to be able to criticize bad ideas.

87
00:04:08,491 --> 00:04:09,324
And to me this,
I've seen a real schism and people on 

88
00:04:11,641 --> 00:04:13,440
the left,
now I'm obviously on the left,

89
00:04:13,441 --> 00:04:16,740
I stand for liberal principles,
um,

90
00:04:16,830 --> 00:04:17,663
but this schism and this idea that you 
can't criticize ideas without somehow 

91
00:04:22,051 --> 00:04:25,980
condemning a whole group of people.
I know this is a big point of contention

92
00:04:25,981 --> 00:04:27,300
for you.
So can you walk us through that?

93
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:28,333
But I don't,
I don't think that people have 

94
00:04:29,070 --> 00:04:32,160
difficulty criticizing ideas.
I think it's a specific idea,

95
00:04:32,161 --> 00:04:32,994
right?
So I see it everyday in my exchanges on 

96
00:04:34,321 --> 00:04:37,410
facebook.
If I criticize some Jewish practice,

97
00:04:37,470 --> 00:04:39,240
I get many,
many likes on facebook.

98
00:04:39,450 --> 00:04:43,080
If I criticize some Hick,
a Republican senator about his,

99
00:04:43,330 --> 00:04:46,020
his position on evolution,
I get tons of likes.

100
00:04:46,260 --> 00:04:48,600
But if I dare criticize something about 
Islam,

101
00:04:48,601 --> 00:04:53,601
I'll give you a very quick example.
I put up a clip of a Iraqi scientist,

102
00:04:54,570 --> 00:04:55,403
an astronomer who was arguing that the 
earth is flat because it says so in the 

103
00:04:59,221 --> 00:05:01,650
Koran.
So I received,

104
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:04,140
of course,
one of my facebook friends are academics

105
00:05:04,350 --> 00:05:08,700
I received from a white sort of guilt 
within academic from,

106
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:11,190
from California.
And a note saying,

107
00:05:11,191 --> 00:05:11,720
well,
how,

108
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:14,400
what,
why are you ganging up on these folks?

109
00:05:14,550 --> 00:05:15,383
So she wasn't offended by the fact that 
this Iraqi scientists was holding an 

110
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:19,313
astonishingly outrageous view.
She was annoyed that I would actually 

111
00:05:22,861 --> 00:05:23,694
point to that.
So why do you think people have trouble 

112
00:05:26,191 --> 00:05:27,024
making this distinction?
It's very obvious to me as as an 

113
00:05:29,850 --> 00:05:31,620
outsider of this.
I look at,

114
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:33,330
I'm Jewish,
but I look at the book,

115
00:05:33,331 --> 00:05:34,164
you can say whatever you want about the 
book and all the awful things that are 

116
00:05:36,361 --> 00:05:38,190
in the Old Testament and the new 
testament or the Koran.

117
00:05:38,370 --> 00:05:40,380
Frankly,
I haven't really read any of them.

118
00:05:40,530 --> 00:05:41,880
I don't know their,
their books,

119
00:05:41,881 --> 00:05:43,320
their ideas.
Why?

120
00:05:43,350 --> 00:05:44,183
Why do people seem unable to detach 
those two things because I think 

121
00:05:47,380 --> 00:05:48,520
they're.
I think the,

122
00:05:48,570 --> 00:05:49,403
the misinformation associated with the 
idea that if you criticize Islam in 

123
00:05:53,731 --> 00:05:54,564
particular,
you're bigoted because Islam is a 

124
00:05:56,281 --> 00:05:57,114
religion of Brown people and so 
therefore there are simply unable to 

125
00:06:01,071 --> 00:06:01,904
decouple the criticism of a set of 
tenets from the people who may practice 

126
00:06:06,471 --> 00:06:08,150
those tenets.
So to me,

127
00:06:08,151 --> 00:06:11,540
Bill Maher sorta hit the maybe the 
bigger point here,

128
00:06:11,750 --> 00:06:13,880
which is that for people on the left,
for liberals,

129
00:06:13,881 --> 00:06:17,240
we have to stand up consistently for 
liberal principles,

130
00:06:17,241 --> 00:06:18,074
which is certainly what I try to do.
I stand up for women's rights and gay 

131
00:06:20,241 --> 00:06:21,074
rights and freedom of religion and 
economic equality and all of those 

132
00:06:23,451 --> 00:06:24,490
things.
So it was this weird,

133
00:06:24,491 --> 00:06:25,324
liberals have really failed and the way 
they fail is by invoking cultural and 

134
00:06:30,081 --> 00:06:31,340
moral relativism,
right?

135
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:32,353
So who are we to judge that?
Women in some far away land there 

136
00:06:35,990 --> 00:06:37,820
Clarissa's are being cut,
right?

137
00:06:37,821 --> 00:06:42,500
Who are we to impose our cultural 
hegemony on other folks?

138
00:06:42,650 --> 00:06:43,483
And so that's how they're able to still 
be liberal and yet not criticize these 

139
00:06:47,601 --> 00:06:50,720
one particular sets of beliefs by 
invoking cultural relativism.

140
00:06:50,750 --> 00:06:51,583
Right?
So there's a real disconnect in reality 

141
00:06:53,031 --> 00:06:54,770
there because in a,
in a weird way,

142
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:57,930
liberals should be the most for helping 
these pieces on,

143
00:06:57,950 --> 00:06:58,783
right?
Because these are the principles they 

144
00:06:59,481 --> 00:07:00,314
believe in.
So how much of this actually I really 

145
00:07:01,971 --> 00:07:02,804
hadn't thought until just now,
but I guess a lot of this we could sort 

146
00:07:04,221 --> 00:07:08,900
of blame the footsteps of George W Bush 
for going into the wrong war.

147
00:07:08,901 --> 00:07:09,734
We're now,
there's this feeling in America like we 

148
00:07:11,361 --> 00:07:14,450
shouldn't do anything ever because we 
did the wrong thing.

149
00:07:14,451 --> 00:07:17,720
Clearly interacting now it's a,
it's a far worse mess than even before.

150
00:07:17,990 --> 00:07:20,630
Uh,
so some of the blame is on us,

151
00:07:20,631 --> 00:07:21,470
right?
But I mean,

152
00:07:21,471 --> 00:07:22,304
how far do you go back unfolding history
until you find the villain of your 

153
00:07:26,570 --> 00:07:27,403
choice?
Right?

154
00:07:27,730 --> 00:07:30,080
So for example,
when you talk about the Israel Palestine

155
00:07:30,081 --> 00:07:33,500
issue,
people are always able to unfold history

156
00:07:33,501 --> 00:07:35,810
until the starting point that they feel 
happy about.

157
00:07:36,020 --> 00:07:38,060
And then that's the point where we start
the clock,

158
00:07:38,130 --> 00:07:38,963
right?
So where should we start the clock on 

159
00:07:40,011 --> 00:07:42,650
that one?
On the Islam issue in Israel.

160
00:07:42,651 --> 00:07:43,940
Palestine.
Yeah.

161
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:45,980
Well that's,
that's a whole other thing.

162
00:07:45,981 --> 00:07:47,870
It's a whole lot of effect if we could 
get into it if you want.

163
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:48,930
Uh,
uh,

164
00:07:49,310 --> 00:07:50,143
I think the problem there is that you've
got to abrahamic religions that hold 

165
00:07:53,781 --> 00:07:56,390
very,
very rigid positions.

166
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:59,360
And as long as it's going to be les than
would religion,

167
00:07:59,570 --> 00:08:01,960
it's never going to be resolved.
So in a weird way.

168
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:03,920
So what you're saying is that,
uh,

169
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:04,873
that liberals don't want to criticize 
Islam because there's this idea that a 

170
00:08:07,941 --> 00:08:11,810
lot of Islamic people have brown skin,
but there are plenty of Moroccan Jews.

171
00:08:11,811 --> 00:08:12,800
You're,
you're Lebanese Jew,

172
00:08:12,830 --> 00:08:13,663
right?
Uh,

173
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:16,370
there are plenty of Christians that are 
Iraqi.

174
00:08:16,620 --> 00:08:18,230
There's not that many anymore.
But.

175
00:08:18,231 --> 00:08:20,570
So even that,
in a weird way you could say that that's

176
00:08:20,571 --> 00:08:21,860
actually bigoted,
that,

177
00:08:21,861 --> 00:08:23,430
that,
that concept is big.

178
00:08:23,431 --> 00:08:24,350
And how do you,
as,

179
00:08:24,351 --> 00:08:28,250
as a dark skinned a Jew you feel about 
that?

180
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:29,113
Well,
I usually am able to get away with more 

181
00:08:30,831 --> 00:08:34,910
stuff precisely because I invoke the 
fact that I have dark skin.

182
00:08:34,911 --> 00:08:37,150
The fact that I'm from the Middle East 
and I,

183
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:38,113
I use this victimology game against the 
social justice warriors basically 

184
00:08:41,481 --> 00:08:41,781
saying,
Hey,

185
00:08:41,781 --> 00:08:43,430
be careful,
don't you criticize me?

186
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:46,310
Because then you'd be engaging our 
football,

187
00:08:46,410 --> 00:08:48,870
our phobia,
fattism.

188
00:08:50,270 --> 00:08:51,103
I actually did the privilege score and I
scored off the chart and my non 

189
00:08:55,170 --> 00:08:56,003
privilege.

190
00:08:56,030 --> 00:08:58,260
So I'm untouchable.
You were completely unimaginable.

191
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:00,870
So the next part of this that I think is
particularly interesting,

192
00:09:00,871 --> 00:09:01,704
and this is really where we met because 
of the twitter thing that I referenced 

193
00:09:04,230 --> 00:09:05,063
earlier,
is there has been sort of an endless 

194
00:09:07,290 --> 00:09:10,380
onslaught on Sam Harris since this.
Now.

195
00:09:10,381 --> 00:09:12,330
Sam is a philosopher.
I think he's a neuroscientist.

196
00:09:12,331 --> 00:09:13,710
I've read this.
I've read some books.

197
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:19,280
He's not a political person per se.
He writes a little bit about politics,

198
00:09:19,381 --> 00:09:20,214
but not really,
but there has been this endless 

199
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:23,940
onslaught and I think slandering and 
smearing him,

200
00:09:24,150 --> 00:09:24,983
coming from the left from people that in
some cases I admire partly some people 

201
00:09:28,501 --> 00:09:29,920
that I've worked with,
I'm talking about from,

202
00:09:29,970 --> 00:09:30,803
from Glenn Greenwald,
who obviously has done great stuff with 

203
00:09:32,071 --> 00:09:34,350
the NSA and Reza Aslan,
my former boss,

204
00:09:34,351 --> 00:09:36,960
Janky younger people that are really 
distorting his views.

205
00:09:36,961 --> 00:09:37,794
And I wanted to show a tweet that I got 
last night that I think kind of sums up 

206
00:09:40,891 --> 00:09:41,220
the whole thing.

207
00:09:41,220 --> 00:09:42,290
So let's,
let's take a look at the tweet.

208
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:43,170
Okay.
So this had nothing.

209
00:09:43,171 --> 00:09:45,450
I wasn't tweeting about this.
This has nothing to do with anything.

210
00:09:45,690 --> 00:09:47,640
And someone tweeted,
Zap me questioning for Ruben report,

211
00:09:47,641 --> 00:09:48,474
how exactly are we better than Isis?
If we knew the Middle East killing 

212
00:09:52,471 --> 00:09:55,830
millions of civilians like Sam Harris 
suggest.

213
00:09:55,980 --> 00:09:58,100
And then Sam Harris later wrote back and
said,

214
00:09:58,120 --> 00:09:59,940
you really believe that?
I've actually suggested that.

215
00:10:00,030 --> 00:10:01,410
Okay,
so that tweet right there.

216
00:10:01,411 --> 00:10:02,244
The reason I wanted to use it is because
I feel like it's a perfect example of 

217
00:10:04,741 --> 00:10:08,370
how this discussion that we're talking 
about has been so far derail.

218
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:11,670
Now of course Sam Harris doesn't want to
nuke them in the Middle East.

219
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:12,653
He had one page in his book that's 
mostly about philosophy and religion 

220
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:16,673
where he's talking about how in the Cold
War we had a mutual assurance is 

221
00:10:20,821 --> 00:10:21,654
basically with Russia because you had 
rational actors basically that wouldn't 

222
00:10:24,931 --> 00:10:26,770
nuke each other because then they were 
afraid they were going to get new.

223
00:10:27,630 --> 00:10:28,463
Now this has nothing to keep.
Never said nuke the Middle East or any 

224
00:10:30,631 --> 00:10:32,820
of this stuff,
but these people keep implying it.

225
00:10:33,030 --> 00:10:36,540
They keep retweeting memes of selective 
quotes.

226
00:10:36,990 --> 00:10:38,450
What do you make of that?
I mean these.

227
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:41,940
These are pretty respected people.
Some that I know personally,

228
00:10:41,941 --> 00:10:44,070
which is why I struggle with this so 
much,

229
00:10:44,270 --> 00:10:45,103
you know,
in the battle of ideologies that people 

230
00:10:46,681 --> 00:10:49,080
that you want to go after are not the 
people who've got big muscles,

231
00:10:49,081 --> 00:10:52,260
but the people who have big brains,
those are sort of totalitarian ideology.

232
00:10:52,261 --> 00:10:54,870
Ideology is always go after the 
intellectuals first.

233
00:10:54,990 --> 00:10:55,823
They want to purge them because they 
don't want anybody to counter their 

234
00:10:57,630 --> 00:11:00,570
narrative and so this is exactly what 
happens to guys like Sam Harris.

235
00:11:00,571 --> 00:11:04,410
He has a huge following that he can't be
literally beheaded because we don't live

236
00:11:04,411 --> 00:11:05,244
in the Middle East,
but I could certainly try my darnedest 

237
00:11:07,050 --> 00:11:07,883
to be head his reputation and I'm going 
to do that by engaging in endless miss 

238
00:11:11,351 --> 00:11:12,184
information so that people can distance 
themselves from him and he's just a 

239
00:11:14,821 --> 00:11:15,300
crack.

240
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:16,710
He's a,
he's a warmonger,

241
00:11:16,711 --> 00:11:17,544
he's a Nazi.
He's part of a Zionist conspiracy and 

242
00:11:20,341 --> 00:11:22,050
hopefully you'll kind.
Don't forget Neocon,

243
00:11:22,051 --> 00:11:22,884
right?
That's new economy part of Halliburton 

244
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:25,530
and so on and,
and,

245
00:11:25,531 --> 00:11:26,364
and the way I behead him,
the way I silence him as by smearing 

246
00:11:30,261 --> 00:11:30,781
come.
Right?

247
00:11:30,781 --> 00:11:32,640
So isn't that really the crazy part of 
this?

248
00:11:32,641 --> 00:11:33,510
When,
when they're saying,

249
00:11:33,511 --> 00:11:35,270
well,
you know,

250
00:11:35,460 --> 00:11:36,293
Sam Harris is in the same neo-con group,
or Bill Maher's and the same neo-con 

251
00:11:40,171 --> 00:11:41,004
group as Dick Cheney.
Bill Maher has never talked about all 

252
00:11:43,861 --> 00:11:45,450
the time he wants our,
we have 30,000

253
00:11:45,451 --> 00:11:47,590
trench or something in Germany.
What are they doing there?

254
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:50,130
But this is literally the reverse of a 
neo con.

255
00:11:50,430 --> 00:11:51,630
Um,
but these,

256
00:11:51,750 --> 00:11:54,070
these slurs,
these are slanders,

257
00:11:54,071 --> 00:11:54,701
right?
Really,

258
00:11:54,701 --> 00:11:55,534
I mean is that while these,
these false equivalences are everywhere 

259
00:11:59,801 --> 00:12:01,210
within this discourse.
So for example,

260
00:12:01,211 --> 00:12:03,910
if you take some feminists,
they'll argue that,

261
00:12:04,180 --> 00:12:05,013
uh,
the bikini is a patriarchal tool of 

262
00:12:07,901 --> 00:12:08,620
oppression.

263
00:12:08,620 --> 00:12:09,453
Whereas the Burka is a liberating thing 
because it removes the male gaze from 

264
00:12:14,351 --> 00:12:15,184
the picture,
right?

265
00:12:15,250 --> 00:12:18,940
So while the Bikini clad women is being 
visually raped by men,

266
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:19,960
uh,
once you,

267
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:22,240
once you don the burka,
she is liberated.

268
00:12:22,420 --> 00:12:24,670
So these types of equivalencies are 
astonishing,

269
00:12:24,671 --> 00:12:27,850
but they're everywhere right now.
As backwards as I may think that is,

270
00:12:28,060 --> 00:12:29,260
I would say,
you know what?

271
00:12:29,261 --> 00:12:30,094
You can believe that if you want,
but it should be up to the woman to 

272
00:12:32,261 --> 00:12:35,470
decide where in most of those countries 
where women are wearing burgers,

273
00:12:35,471 --> 00:12:37,030
they don't really have the choice not to
wear.

274
00:12:37,031 --> 00:12:37,864
Of course now I'm more critical at this 
point and where I'm at of the left 

275
00:12:40,781 --> 00:12:43,150
because I'm part of the left and I want 
the left to be better.

276
00:12:43,151 --> 00:12:46,190
I've long given up on trying to fix the 
right right here.

277
00:12:46,410 --> 00:12:48,370
That's that know I'm not going to fix 
the tea party,

278
00:12:48,371 --> 00:12:51,340
but I can at least I think try to change
for the better.

279
00:12:51,340 --> 00:12:54,930
The part that I'm with.
So that's why this is so disappointing.

280
00:12:54,980 --> 00:12:55,813
What do you make of this idea that the,
that the far left is attacking atheists 

281
00:12:59,860 --> 00:13:02,260
have of all groups of people?
It's astonishing.

282
00:13:02,280 --> 00:13:03,113
I mean what?
I guess one of the reasons why they 

283
00:13:04,811 --> 00:13:07,760
attacked the atheist is because they 
might be some of the most philosophers,

284
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:12,190
a group of of people that are critical 
of religion in general,

285
00:13:12,191 --> 00:13:13,024
but Islam in particular,
and so to the extent that the 

286
00:13:14,771 --> 00:13:18,490
progressives don't like criticism of 
Islam and to the extent that many of the

287
00:13:18,491 --> 00:13:21,850
most famous atheists are quite 
vociferous in their criticism of Islam,

288
00:13:21,851 --> 00:13:22,684
then we have to go after them and I 
guess this goes back to what you were 

289
00:13:24,221 --> 00:13:25,054
saying earlier,
but they don't seem to be able to make 

290
00:13:26,501 --> 00:13:27,334
the distinction.
When Bill Maher relentlessly attacked 

291
00:13:29,891 --> 00:13:31,910
Christianity,
nobody calls him a Christian of.

292
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:32,650
Right,
right.

293
00:13:32,650 --> 00:13:33,250
I mean he,
I,

294
00:13:33,250 --> 00:13:37,090
he made a documentary where he attacked 
the big three religions relentlessly.

295
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:40,390
Nobody had prompts.
So like the processing of information is

296
00:13:40,391 --> 00:13:41,800
a big cognitive bias,
right?

297
00:13:41,801 --> 00:13:42,634
So I will only pay attention to 
information that supports my position 

298
00:13:46,091 --> 00:13:47,620
and that's exactly what the progressives
are doing.

299
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:52,000
They're ignoring the endless times that 
bill Maher attacks other religions,

300
00:13:52,220 --> 00:13:55,030
but they only tune in when he criticizes
Islam.

301
00:13:55,060 --> 00:13:57,130
I would bet,
and someone can check this for us,

302
00:13:57,131 --> 00:13:57,964
but I would bet that Bill Maher has 
spent far more time attacking 

303
00:13:59,951 --> 00:14:00,784
Christianity because he attacks things 
in this country far more than than 

304
00:14:03,781 --> 00:14:04,614
attacking Islam or Judaism or whatever.
What do you make of how much hatred 

305
00:14:08,890 --> 00:14:12,430
there seems to be towards atheists at 
the moment because I see all these poles

306
00:14:12,580 --> 00:14:13,413
and on the show,
many times we've done how atheists are 

307
00:14:14,591 --> 00:14:16,600
the most underrepresented group in 
everything.

308
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:17,433
Barney frank,
who was in Congress for 30 something 

309
00:14:19,541 --> 00:14:20,374
years,
was able to come out as gay in the 

310
00:14:21,970 --> 00:14:22,803
eighties,
but not as an atheist until he retired 

311
00:14:24,820 --> 00:14:26,170
from Congress.
Right?

312
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:29,320
What do you make of this?
Because atheist hold no power.

313
00:14:29,321 --> 00:14:31,270
Have not.
Our people are atheist,

314
00:14:31,271 --> 00:14:33,410
killing people that I don't know about 
my.

315
00:14:33,530 --> 00:14:34,363
My feeling is that there is a coupling 
of atheism and immorality in the minds 

316
00:14:39,311 --> 00:14:41,290
of most people,
so most people believe that.

317
00:14:41,291 --> 00:14:43,090
It doesn't matter which religion you 
follow,

318
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:47,080
as long as you are religious,
then you somehow have a moral compass by

319
00:14:47,081 --> 00:14:47,914
which you live your life.
By however atheists go around beheading 

320
00:14:51,620 --> 00:14:54,230
and then raping them for in the minds of
those folks.

321
00:14:54,350 --> 00:14:55,183
And so an atheist is not to be trusted 
because how else working he get his 

322
00:14:58,491 --> 00:15:00,650
morality if it's not from some Bronze 
Age book.

323
00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:03,320
So I think what you just told me that 
it's complete nonsense.

324
00:15:03,410 --> 00:15:04,640
It is complete.
Unless I mean it,

325
00:15:04,641 --> 00:15:06,080
could it be anything other than that,
right?

326
00:15:06,081 --> 00:15:06,914
I mean,
because atheist simply aren't doing any 

327
00:15:08,380 --> 00:15:09,250
other things.
No,

328
00:15:09,260 --> 00:15:10,093
it's good.
It's complete lunacy political 

329
00:15:11,091 --> 00:15:11,924
correctness,
which I think is completely running 

330
00:15:13,701 --> 00:15:18,050
rampant across America right now.
I live within it as an academic,

331
00:15:18,051 --> 00:15:19,520
as an academic,
so we're going to swim in it,

332
00:15:19,770 --> 00:15:20,160
so,
you know.

333
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:21,170
All right,
so let's start there then.

334
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:23,240
So to the college part of this,
uh,

335
00:15:23,241 --> 00:15:24,950
you know Jerry Seinfeld about a month 
ago.

336
00:15:24,951 --> 00:15:27,250
Jerry Seinfeld,
who is the most apolitical comic.

337
00:15:27,251 --> 00:15:29,570
Yes.
I know everything about Jerry Seinfeld.

338
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:31,250
I don't know any of his political 
beliefs.

339
00:15:31,251 --> 00:15:33,350
I have no idea if he's for abortion,
for the death penalty.

340
00:15:33,620 --> 00:15:34,453
Nobody has any idea what he thinks he 
now is saying the college campuses have 

341
00:15:38,241 --> 00:15:40,760
gone too politically correct.
Politically correct.

342
00:15:40,910 --> 00:15:43,690
Chris Rock has backed him on this.
Um,

343
00:15:44,060 --> 00:15:44,893
you know,
a whole bunch of comedians have said 

344
00:15:46,311 --> 00:15:49,520
this,
what is going on on college campuses.

345
00:15:49,550 --> 00:15:51,290
I'll give you a powerful personal 
anecdote.

346
00:15:51,310 --> 00:15:52,143
A last year I gave a talk at Wellesley 
college and all women's college about 

347
00:15:55,521 --> 00:15:58,340
the thought police and how it regulates 
the free exchange of ideas.

348
00:15:58,820 --> 00:16:01,890
After my lecture,
a student came up to me and said,

349
00:16:02,350 --> 00:16:03,183
I don't think there's anything wrong 
with the idea of a professor at the 

350
00:16:05,811 --> 00:16:10,040
start of class pulling 100 students 
about how you should address them.

351
00:16:10,340 --> 00:16:11,450
So even though,
for example,

352
00:16:11,451 --> 00:16:14,600
Dave Rubin is my student,
I clearly see you as a male at the start

353
00:16:14,601 --> 00:16:15,434
of every lecture I should say,
do you do gender identify as male or 

354
00:16:18,711 --> 00:16:19,544
female because that will deter.
So I looked at her and in true 

355
00:16:21,561 --> 00:16:22,394
astonishment I said,
do you really see this as a viable way 

356
00:16:25,041 --> 00:16:25,874
by which society would be organized?
Where every single time we interact we 

357
00:16:28,671 --> 00:16:29,504
should first preempt any,
any greeting with what do you self 

358
00:16:33,621 --> 00:16:34,430
identify as?

359
00:16:34,430 --> 00:16:35,360
And she said,
absolutely,

360
00:16:35,361 --> 00:16:36,194
because that way you wouldn't be hurting
anybody by placing them in the wrong 

361
00:16:39,441 --> 00:16:41,510
category.
That's astonishing.

362
00:16:41,511 --> 00:16:42,141
Right.
Okay.

363
00:16:42,141 --> 00:16:43,760
So what's the most dangerous part of 
that?

364
00:16:43,761 --> 00:16:46,520
Because to me it seems like,
let's say you went ahead and did that.

365
00:16:46,550 --> 00:16:47,383
You taught this class exactly as sort of
the social justice warriors would want 

366
00:16:51,111 --> 00:16:51,944
you to teach it.
Well the world doesn't operate like 

367
00:16:54,141 --> 00:16:54,651
that.
Right?

368
00:16:54,651 --> 00:16:58,280
So then are you actually then setting up
these kids,

369
00:16:58,281 --> 00:17:03,281
these college kids for a huge awakening 
where the day they graduate college,

370
00:17:03,710 --> 00:17:06,230
but they're not well trained to face 
that real world,

371
00:17:06,300 --> 00:17:07,133
right.
There are so tentative and the way they 

372
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:12,020
express themselves,
right?

373
00:17:12,140 --> 00:17:14,390
They're so afraid to step outside the 
herd.

374
00:17:14,420 --> 00:17:16,700
I mean if you look at intellectual 
diversity on campuses,

375
00:17:16,910 --> 00:17:18,590
which is very much related to what we're
talking about,

376
00:17:18,830 --> 00:17:19,880
it's breathtaking.
Right?

377
00:17:20,120 --> 00:17:21,490
Look,
I'm Canadian so I don't care.

378
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:23,750
Republican or Democrat.
I don't have a dog in that fight,

379
00:17:24,140 --> 00:17:25,700
but there are.
I got to get this straight.

380
00:17:26,140 --> 00:17:28,400
Jus Heron,
Canadian man,

381
00:17:28,401 --> 00:17:30,560
atheists,
atheists and brown skin.

382
00:17:30,650 --> 00:17:33,050
Oh my gosh.
You really do have a lot.

383
00:17:33,051 --> 00:17:33,884
All right.
Sorry.

384
00:17:34,060 --> 00:17:34,830
So,
so there,

385
00:17:34,830 --> 00:17:38,720
there were studies that were done 
looking at the political affiliations of

386
00:17:38,750 --> 00:17:41,480
professors at Major American 
universities,

387
00:17:41,481 --> 00:17:46,040
whether they're republican or Democrat,
and the numbers are just astonishing and

388
00:17:46,041 --> 00:17:46,874
they get worse and worse in terms of the
ratio as a function of the softness of 

389
00:17:49,951 --> 00:17:50,784
the field.
So in the humanities and sociology and 

390
00:17:52,981 --> 00:17:56,370
gender studies,
it's something like 40 1:44

391
00:17:56,371 --> 00:17:59,880
to one ratio of.
Now for some issues,

392
00:18:00,060 --> 00:18:03,090
political,
a political lens doesn't matter,

393
00:18:03,091 --> 00:18:04,200
but for others,
uh,

394
00:18:04,260 --> 00:18:07,980
as the death penalty appropriate,
what should be our fiscal policy?

395
00:18:08,310 --> 00:18:09,143
Should we be?
Should we be foreign policy 

396
00:18:10,300 --> 00:18:11,310
interventionists?
Well,

397
00:18:11,311 --> 00:18:12,144
your political lens effects these 
discussions and to have all academia 

398
00:18:17,550 --> 00:18:22,050
being represented by one side of the 
political spectrum as horrifying.

399
00:18:22,140 --> 00:18:23,850
So what do we do about that?
I mean,

400
00:18:23,851 --> 00:18:28,790
even though I may in most cases agree 
with that end of academia,

401
00:18:28,810 --> 00:18:30,450
not certainly not the political correct 
side,

402
00:18:30,451 --> 00:18:33,360
but I might agree with him 
philosophically on a lot of the points.

403
00:18:33,810 --> 00:18:36,640
How do you balance that out?
So Thomas Solo,

404
00:18:36,641 --> 00:18:39,380
who's a very famous conservative 
economists,

405
00:18:39,470 --> 00:18:42,060
a set,
and I'm going to botch the exact quote,

406
00:18:42,270 --> 00:18:46,230
he said,
a intellectual diversity is diversity on

407
00:18:46,231 --> 00:18:49,380
campuses as great as long as it's sexual
orientation,

408
00:18:49,470 --> 00:18:51,390
diversity,
ethnic diversity,

409
00:18:51,391 --> 00:18:54,360
racial diversity,
but the one diversity that should really

410
00:18:54,361 --> 00:18:55,950
matter,
intellectual diversity,

411
00:18:56,370 --> 00:18:57,440
we condemn it.
Well,

412
00:18:57,460 --> 00:19:00,090
what we need to do is just a thought,
which is thought exactly.

413
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:01,193
And what we need to.
It was to find ways to create greater 

414
00:19:03,451 --> 00:19:07,320
diversity on campus is to allow both 
sides of any position to speak.

415
00:19:08,130 --> 00:19:08,963
Do you think a lot of this has to do 
with the way our culture has changed in 

416
00:19:11,701 --> 00:19:12,630
the last couple of years?

417
00:19:12,630 --> 00:19:14,640
Like where are you can't bully a kid 
now.

418
00:19:14,641 --> 00:19:15,474
I'm not for bullying of course,
but that this concept where we keep 

419
00:19:18,870 --> 00:19:22,720
making everything that no one can ever 
be offended by anything else.

420
00:19:22,950 --> 00:19:23,581
Uh,
you know,

421
00:19:23,581 --> 00:19:26,970
they took after the confederate flag,
after the shooting in Charleston.

422
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:29,400
Now they took dukes of hazzard off 
television.

423
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:31,110
Do.
Those guys were not,

424
00:19:31,350 --> 00:19:33,930
they were not somehow southern white 
supremacists.

425
00:19:33,931 --> 00:19:34,750
You know what I mean?
But they,

426
00:19:34,750 --> 00:19:36,480
they took that off television.
Again,

427
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:39,600
I'm not going to defend cosby who was 
one of my comedy heroes growing up,

428
00:19:39,780 --> 00:19:41,940
but they took the cosby show up.
They're like,

429
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:46,110
we're starting to censor ourselves.
I think in a way that's going to lead to

430
00:19:46,111 --> 00:19:46,944
everything.
You know,

431
00:19:47,010 --> 00:19:49,320
every time I watched Seinfeld now,
every episode,

432
00:19:49,321 --> 00:19:50,154
I think in 10 years they're gonna say 
this was racist and massage every 

433
00:19:53,250 --> 00:19:54,083
literally every single episode.
Salon did a piece a couple of weeks ago 

434
00:19:56,671 --> 00:19:57,220
about trouble.

435
00:19:57,220 --> 00:19:59,190
Some episodes,
episodes of Seinfeld.

436
00:19:59,370 --> 00:20:00,750
What?
What do we do to combat that?

437
00:20:00,810 --> 00:20:03,690
Well,
progressive's pray at the altar.

438
00:20:03,930 --> 00:20:06,960
They self flagellate at the altar of non
offense.

439
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:08,220
I mean that's,
that's their,

440
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:09,700
their motto.
A,

441
00:20:09,710 --> 00:20:11,880
we need to find a way to break through 
this thought.

442
00:20:11,881 --> 00:20:12,330
Police.
I'm not.

443
00:20:12,330 --> 00:20:13,163
Give you an example.
When I used to be a very competitive 

444
00:20:14,491 --> 00:20:17,460
soccer player,
if I were to today,

445
00:20:17,490 --> 00:20:22,170
look at the trash talking that went on 
the soccer fields between players,

446
00:20:22,171 --> 00:20:26,160
which is part of the ritual.
Then everybody would be arrested today.

447
00:20:26,220 --> 00:20:27,810
Everybody would be sent to a hate 
speech.

448
00:20:27,811 --> 00:20:28,321
Try again.
Right?

449
00:20:28,321 --> 00:20:29,154
Because you mean because of racist stuff
and homophobic on everything under the 

450
00:20:31,481 --> 00:20:32,314
sun.
Exactly,

451
00:20:32,610 --> 00:20:33,443
guess what I heard camel jockey grow 
growing up playing soccer and I lived 

452
00:20:37,011 --> 00:20:38,310
to,
to love again,

453
00:20:38,830 --> 00:20:41,490
right?
I mean it's called life grow a pair.

454
00:20:41,610 --> 00:20:42,690
So,
so how do we,

455
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:47,440
what do we do about that because that I 
really like what do we do to grow a pair

456
00:20:47,441 --> 00:20:49,900
for the country or for Canada or.

457
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:52,120
I mean there are many different ways.
For example,

458
00:20:52,170 --> 00:20:53,950
uh,
the culture of narcissism is,

459
00:20:54,020 --> 00:20:57,280
it's certainly not helping the kids.
The culture of entitlement,

460
00:20:57,310 --> 00:20:59,230
right?
Everybody should get an a plus.

461
00:20:59,231 --> 00:21:01,750
Everybody should get their medal.
Everybody should get a trophy.

462
00:21:01,751 --> 00:21:05,380
So there,
there's several different movements that

463
00:21:05,381 --> 00:21:07,270
have,
for lack of a better word,

464
00:21:07,300 --> 00:21:08,133
pussified the west.
You're not going to be happy with you 

465
00:21:10,541 --> 00:21:11,670
for that if that's okay.
Bring.

466
00:21:12,090 --> 00:21:12,923
All right,
let's talk a little bit about some of 

467
00:21:14,081 --> 00:21:15,250
the,
uh,

468
00:21:15,670 --> 00:21:17,620
some of the machinations I suppose,
of,

469
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:21,100
of things that are going on on college,
trigger warnings and some of these other

470
00:21:21,220 --> 00:21:22,001
things.
So you were sort of,

471
00:21:22,001 --> 00:21:23,500
you sort of talked about this a little 
bit earlier.

472
00:21:23,650 --> 00:21:26,010
Safe spaces,
safe spaces,

473
00:21:26,050 --> 00:21:26,883
safe spaces is a place where I can go so
that I'm protected from things that 

474
00:21:30,461 --> 00:21:33,130
might make me go into a fetal position 
and suck my thumb.

475
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:34,930
So give me one for example.
Well,

476
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,160
why would you go to a site?
Why would someone in college go to it?

477
00:21:37,750 --> 00:21:38,583
Maybe there's going to be a speaker 
who's going to talk something about pro 

478
00:21:42,941 --> 00:21:43,774
Israel and uh,
I might be a student who is very much 

479
00:21:46,571 --> 00:21:47,404
against Israel.
And so that makes me feel very 

480
00:21:48,821 --> 00:21:53,821
threatened at University of Michigan.
They wanted to simply show,

481
00:21:54,340 --> 00:21:55,540
was it,
was it called sniper?

482
00:21:55,541 --> 00:21:57,390
What was it?
The movie American sniper.

483
00:21:57,800 --> 00:21:58,633
And that made a lot of the students feel
very unsafe simply because that movie 

484
00:22:02,411 --> 00:22:05,800
was going to be shown on campus.
It's astonishing.

485
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:07,570
Do you remember when,
uh,

486
00:22:07,810 --> 00:22:12,340
Bill Maher was being asked to give the 
commencement speech at Berkeley,

487
00:22:12,370 --> 00:22:13,890
Berkeley,
which is the bastion,

488
00:22:13,940 --> 00:22:14,773
the home of free speech in America.
And some of the kids there didn't want 

489
00:22:19,210 --> 00:22:20,710
him to do it.
He ended up doing it,

490
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:21,880
but he had a guest.

491
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:22,713
I forget her name.
I was actually in the audience that 

492
00:22:24,040 --> 00:22:24,873
episode.
He had a guest who said that he 

493
00:22:27,011 --> 00:22:29,470
shouldn't do it because he's against 
free speech.

494
00:22:29,620 --> 00:22:30,910
Meanwhile,
she's on her.

495
00:22:31,090 --> 00:22:34,600
She's on his show using her right to 
free speech.

496
00:22:34,690 --> 00:22:37,750
So there's like a a cognitive 
disconnect.

497
00:22:37,751 --> 00:22:38,584
There's absolutely.
I wrote an article where I have 

498
00:22:40,570 --> 00:22:45,010
Huffington post where I talked about 
trigger warnings and I listed all of the

499
00:22:45,011 --> 00:22:45,844
different concepts that necessitate 
trigger warnings pretty much everything 

500
00:22:50,201 --> 00:22:51,130
under the sun.
I mean,

501
00:22:51,131 --> 00:22:53,980
literally life requires a trigger 
warning.

502
00:22:54,230 --> 00:22:57,220
Is this why everyone's medicated?
Pretty much,

503
00:22:57,221 --> 00:22:58,420
right?
I think you're onto something.

504
00:22:58,460 --> 00:22:59,293
You know,
I do think there is a connection 

505
00:22:59,861 --> 00:23:00,611
between,
you know,

506
00:23:00,611 --> 00:23:03,040
if you do all this stuff right and you 
give every year,

507
00:23:03,041 --> 00:23:05,050
everyone is the trigger warnings.
You give them safe spaces.

508
00:23:05,051 --> 00:23:07,510
You don't let them hear from contrarian 
views and all this stuff.

509
00:23:07,660 --> 00:23:10,680
Then you throw them out in the world 
where none of this stuff is real because

510
00:23:10,690 --> 00:23:11,523
you get out to the world and it's pretty
shitty and you're know you're going to 

511
00:23:13,421 --> 00:23:16,480
have a boss that might be sexist or a 
neighbor that might be homophobic.

512
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:17,553
That is why then everyone,
Medicaid's because then they're not 

513
00:23:20,290 --> 00:23:23,140
given the tools to deal in reality life.
I agree.

514
00:23:23,230 --> 00:23:24,630
How's that?
Behavioral Sciences.

515
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:26,870
That's rather nice.
Pop Psychology.

516
00:23:26,871 --> 00:23:28,330
Very nice.
I thought that was pretty good.

517
00:23:28,360 --> 00:23:31,090
Do you think the Internet is helping or 
hurting?

518
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:32,681
A bit of both.
I mean,

519
00:23:32,681 --> 00:23:33,514
I think to the extent that the Internet 
serves as a vehicle for meme 

520
00:23:37,091 --> 00:23:39,610
propagation,
people can get their message out,

521
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,860
otherwise they might have difficulty 
doing so.

522
00:23:41,950 --> 00:23:45,380
So in that sense it's great.
The problem is that some of the ones who

523
00:23:45,381 --> 00:23:46,214
hurled the greatest amount of venom are 
the people who really are against the 

524
00:23:49,311 --> 00:23:50,290
free exchange of ideas.

525
00:23:50,290 --> 00:23:52,820
So the social justice warriors that come
after guys.

526
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:53,713
Luckily I've actually been free of most 
of these guys maybe because I'm quite 

527
00:23:56,991 --> 00:23:58,490
reserved than my positions.
Maybe.

528
00:23:58,730 --> 00:23:59,820
Hopefully,
uh,

529
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:02,150
but,
but make sure they come after yesterday.

530
00:24:02,530 --> 00:24:07,490
I'll send some of my people.
So I think that on average a bit of both

531
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:12,290
good in that you allow people to express
themselves bad and that there's one camp

532
00:24:12,291 --> 00:24:15,800
of folks that is a lot more vested in 
shutting down free exchange.

533
00:24:15,830 --> 00:24:16,663
So is that the challenge then of the 
atheist community or the secular 

534
00:24:19,971 --> 00:24:23,570
community or the rational community is 
that we don't yell as loud,

535
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:24,433
right?
So how do we then line up in a way 

536
00:24:27,201 --> 00:24:31,220
versus versus the trolls versus the 
angry mob?

537
00:24:31,370 --> 00:24:33,770
How do you get sane people to band 
together?

538
00:24:33,790 --> 00:24:34,880
Well,
at the very least,

539
00:24:34,881 --> 00:24:35,714
and I often a admonish my academic 
colleagues for this who don't 

540
00:24:38,481 --> 00:24:41,630
participate in this and this great 
public discourse,

541
00:24:41,750 --> 00:24:41,960
right?

542
00:24:41,960 --> 00:24:44,960
They're very interested in doing.
They're very narrow research,

543
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:48,500
but yet they are shy away from talking 
about these bigger issues.

544
00:24:48,501 --> 00:24:49,840
Even though their professors.
I mean you're,

545
00:24:49,870 --> 00:24:51,920
you're all about meme propagation if 
you're a professor.

546
00:24:52,180 --> 00:24:53,013
And so what I would do,
at least what I do at my limited sphere 

547
00:24:55,491 --> 00:24:56,324
of influence,
is to try to get my colleagues to weigh 

548
00:24:58,341 --> 00:24:59,174
in on these issues so that we could have
academics weighing in and not just the 

549
00:25:02,361 --> 00:25:04,710
trolls.
Does that work very well?

550
00:25:05,690 --> 00:25:09,320
I haven't been very successful because 
most are terrified of their shadows.

551
00:25:09,380 --> 00:25:10,850
Yeah.
So what does that say then?

552
00:25:10,851 --> 00:25:14,010
That it's not just.
I guess it's coming from every angle,

553
00:25:14,011 --> 00:25:14,844
right?
It's coming from politicians and it's 

554
00:25:16,521 --> 00:25:19,840
coming from the media people and it's 
coming from the professors,

555
00:25:19,850 --> 00:25:20,683
not just what I would add.
I would add cowardice as part of the 

556
00:25:23,121 --> 00:25:23,960
seven deadly sins.

557
00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:26,240
I would make it a deadly sins and 
cowardice.

558
00:25:26,250 --> 00:25:28,910
It's,
I'm astonished at how cowardly,

559
00:25:29,100 --> 00:25:29,933
uh,
most people are there and I even get 

560
00:25:31,851 --> 00:25:33,410
people who come to me and say,
you know,

561
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:33,811
I mean,
you,

562
00:25:33,811 --> 00:25:35,090
you do great science.
You're,

563
00:25:35,091 --> 00:25:36,320
you're,
you're a non scientist.

564
00:25:36,470 --> 00:25:39,260
Why do you weigh in on these issues?
Because I can't help it because it's,

565
00:25:39,261 --> 00:25:43,400
I feel that it's my job to weigh in on 
issues that are nonsensical.

566
00:25:43,401 --> 00:25:47,210
Like the ones we discussed earlier.
That's part of my job description.

567
00:25:47,270 --> 00:25:47,750
Yeah.
You know,

568
00:25:47,750 --> 00:25:49,880
I feel the same way actually.
Sometimes I think when I'm,

569
00:25:49,910 --> 00:25:50,743
when I'm tweeting about this stuff or 
when I'm writing about or whatever it 

570
00:25:52,641 --> 00:25:53,474
is,
I think I wish I didn't have the right 

571
00:25:55,451 --> 00:25:56,840
to talk about this stuff.
You know,

572
00:25:56,900 --> 00:25:59,030
in a weird way because it's so obvious 
to me.

573
00:25:59,300 --> 00:26:00,010
Uh,
you know,

574
00:26:00,010 --> 00:26:02,790
that the atheist and the seculars that 
we're,

575
00:26:02,840 --> 00:26:04,720
we're on the right side of letting 
everyone.

576
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:07,040
I want to treat everyone as Shitty as 
everyone else.

577
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:09,110
They don't even have to be treated as 
well as everyone else.

578
00:26:09,111 --> 00:26:09,944
You know what I mean?
I don't want to be treated better than 

579
00:26:11,091 --> 00:26:11,924
anyone or worse.
Just treat me the same shitty way you 

580
00:26:13,461 --> 00:26:14,294
treat everybody.
A lot of times when I'm in New York 

581
00:26:15,470 --> 00:26:16,071
City,
that's what I think.

582
00:26:16,071 --> 00:26:18,400
Like everyone,
there's every race there,

583
00:26:18,401 --> 00:26:20,810
there's every color,
every ethnicity,

584
00:26:20,811 --> 00:26:22,850
everything,
and it's like everyone hates each other,

585
00:26:22,851 --> 00:26:24,530
but no one's killing anybody pretty 
much.

586
00:26:24,590 --> 00:26:25,490
Exactly.
Any,

587
00:26:25,491 --> 00:26:26,770
any final thoughts?
I mean,

588
00:26:26,780 --> 00:26:27,970
I could talk to you all day.
Uh,

589
00:26:28,040 --> 00:26:28,873
well hopefully I'll be back again soon.
I wanted to congratulate you on your 

590
00:26:31,341 --> 00:26:33,110
move to this network.
Oh,

591
00:26:33,140 --> 00:26:34,910
thanks.
Great to meet you in person.

592
00:26:34,911 --> 00:26:37,040
And it's weird how twitter works,
right?

593
00:26:37,041 --> 00:26:37,874
We've done this.
We've never spoken more than a hundred 

594
00:26:38,781 --> 00:26:40,940
40 characters and yet I feel like.
I know you're very well.

595
00:26:40,970 --> 00:26:41,740
Yeah,
there you go.

596
00:26:41,740 --> 00:26:44,370
All right,
well you guys can check out gads youtube

597
00:26:44,371 --> 00:26:45,690
page.
We'll annotate to it.

598
00:26:45,691 --> 00:26:48,720
So there should be something if you're 
watching on youtube right over here.

599
00:26:48,721 --> 00:26:50,660
And I thank you very much.
And uh,

600
00:26:50,760 --> 00:26:51,593
yeah,
this is just the beginning of the types 

601
00:26:52,351 --> 00:26:55,010
of stuff we're going to be doing.
Now that we're on TV,

602
00:26:55,011 --> 00:26:55,844
uh,
the new set is coming and the show will 

603
00:26:57,871 --> 00:26:58,704
officially launched.
I think it's the second week in 

604
00:27:00,271 --> 00:27:02,160
September,
but I'll have to check with my lawyers.
