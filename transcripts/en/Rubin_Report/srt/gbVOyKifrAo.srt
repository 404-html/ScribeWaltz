1
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:07,410
Again,
I want to thank you all for and Browny.

2
00:00:07,411 --> 00:00:10,860
You're doing a heck of a job.
FEMA directors working twenty four.

3
00:00:16,340 --> 00:00:17,173
Joining me today is the former director 
of the Federal Emergency Management 

4
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:21,890
Agency,
better known as fema,

5
00:00:22,130 --> 00:00:25,280
as well as the host of the Michael Brown
radio show.

6
00:00:25,550 --> 00:00:27,470
Michael Brown.
Welcome to the Rubin report.

7
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:28,670
Hey Dave.
Good to see you.

8
00:00:28,730 --> 00:00:30,890
Good to be with the.
You know,

9
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:34,150
this is the first time we've ever done 
this where we played a ten second clip.

10
00:00:34,660 --> 00:00:37,990
Let me get.
Do you have any idea where I can.

11
00:00:38,020 --> 00:00:39,980
I can't even imagine what you might be 
talking about.

12
00:00:40,070 --> 00:00:40,903
Yes.
I struggled with it for a little while 

13
00:00:43,101 --> 00:00:43,934
because I thought,
do I want to go right in and throw this 

14
00:00:45,831 --> 00:00:46,664
right at him?
Sort of the infamous moment or do we 

15
00:00:48,741 --> 00:00:50,270
want to ease into it,
but then I thought,

16
00:00:50,271 --> 00:00:51,104
let's just.
Let's just get it out there because it 

17
00:00:54,290 --> 00:00:57,440
is what it is.
It's a seminal moment in my life.

18
00:00:57,830 --> 00:00:59,450
It the.
There's,

19
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:01,700
there's before that moment.
Then after that moment.

20
00:01:01,970 --> 00:01:02,803
Yeah.
Alright.

21
00:01:02,810 --> 00:01:05,270
There are many,
many reasons that I'm glad to be sitting

22
00:01:05,271 --> 00:01:06,104
here with you because I think we're 
going to get into so many of the things 

23
00:01:08,391 --> 00:01:09,224
that we talked about on the show all the
time about the role of government and 

24
00:01:11,451 --> 00:01:14,330
the difference between local government 
and federal government,

25
00:01:14,331 --> 00:01:17,060
all of these agencies and red tape and 
all that,

26
00:01:17,061 --> 00:01:17,894
but also that for that moment and what 
happened for the months and probably 

27
00:01:21,771 --> 00:01:25,400
years after that and actually even I 
when I was googling you this morning,

28
00:01:25,460 --> 00:01:26,293
all the 10 year anniversary people that 
were still pissed at you and all that 

29
00:01:28,761 --> 00:01:31,550
stuff.
It has a lot to do with your sort of the

30
00:01:31,551 --> 00:01:34,910
general outrage culture and blame 
culture and all of that.

31
00:01:34,911 --> 00:01:35,744
So we're going to do a lot here.
So first let's just start with that 

32
00:01:38,211 --> 00:01:40,600
moment though and then and then I want 
to do everything else back.

33
00:01:40,630 --> 00:01:42,170
Sure.
Okay.

34
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:46,940
Just tell me a little bit about the days
leading up to Hurricane Katrina.

35
00:01:48,290 --> 00:01:53,270
It became clear to me probably within.
Well,

36
00:01:53,271 --> 00:01:54,104
it came clear to me the day after the 
storm made landfall because I was on a 

37
00:01:57,621 --> 00:02:01,220
Black Hawk helicopter with former 
senator Mary Landrieu,

38
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:02,593
and we were supposed to be going 
straight to the superdome to meet with 

39
00:02:04,971 --> 00:02:05,804
Mayor Nagin,
who I always like to joke is remind 

40
00:02:07,641 --> 00:02:11,790
people he's still in federal prison and 
in I'm sitting there and I'm not.

41
00:02:11,870 --> 00:02:12,703
I'm just kind of reading my notes from 
my staff and I look out the helicopter 

42
00:02:15,781 --> 00:02:16,614
and I realized that we're going the 
wrong direction across lake 

43
00:02:19,131 --> 00:02:23,630
pontchartrain and I asked the pilot,
where were you going?

44
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:24,751
And he said,
well,

45
00:02:24,751 --> 00:02:29,751
the senator has asked that we go check 
her cabin before we go to the superdome.

46
00:02:31,370 --> 00:02:32,203
I was livid,
so now I have a sitting United States 

47
00:02:34,401 --> 00:02:38,630
senator next to me who's just overridden
what I said we need to be doing and what

48
00:02:38,631 --> 00:02:39,680
the priorities are.

49
00:02:39,950 --> 00:02:40,783
I have the governor sitting next to her 
who doesn't have the wherewithal to say 

50
00:02:43,971 --> 00:02:45,530
to the senator,
you know what?

51
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:46,393
Your cabin is not our priority.
The priority is the people of New 

52
00:02:49,460 --> 00:02:50,293
Orleans.
It was a moment that I realized that I 

53
00:02:52,491 --> 00:02:56,000
had walked into a state that was so much
more corrupt.

54
00:02:56,001 --> 00:02:56,834
I've been involved in politics and so I 
was literally six years old that was 

55
00:02:59,231 --> 00:03:00,064
just so corrupt and it was so 
dysfunctional that I knew that 

56
00:03:03,011 --> 00:03:07,300
everything that I had in my head about 
how things should operate,

57
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:09,010
we're going to start going out the 
window.

58
00:03:09,370 --> 00:03:10,203
Okay.
I think that's actually a perfect story 

59
00:03:11,351 --> 00:03:15,190
to now start with your childhood.
Let's just,

60
00:03:15,370 --> 00:03:18,100
let's just get a little bias because I 
think that's really interesting and what

61
00:03:18,101 --> 00:03:18,934
led you to eventually be the director of
Fema and then we'll go through 

62
00:03:21,641 --> 00:03:22,474
everything else.
So just tell me a little bit about 

63
00:03:23,741 --> 00:03:24,220
growing up.

64
00:03:24,220 --> 00:03:25,053
Was Your family political?
What sort of got you into this world 

65
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:27,851
like?
Yeah.

66
00:03:27,851 --> 00:03:29,860
My family was kind of political.
When I think about it.

67
00:03:29,861 --> 00:03:33,850
I mean my mom is 86,
87 years old and she still works for the

68
00:03:33,851 --> 00:03:34,684
election board.
She still does the little local 

69
00:03:36,551 --> 00:03:38,340
elections in the little town that I grew
up in.

70
00:03:38,410 --> 00:03:40,520
I think you'd have to be over 80 to work
at the electrical.

71
00:03:40,610 --> 00:03:42,280
Exactly.
I think it is a requirement,

72
00:03:42,290 --> 00:03:43,870
she's been doing this since she was in 
high school,

73
00:03:44,260 --> 00:03:48,490
but when the first Republican governor 
of Oklahoma was running,

74
00:03:48,491 --> 00:03:52,030
he was state party chairman,
a guy by the name of Henry Belding,

75
00:03:52,290 --> 00:03:54,430
uh,
was coming out to the Oklahoma panhandle

76
00:03:54,790 --> 00:03:55,623
and they recruited me at six years old 
to be the little kid to him the push 

77
00:03:59,071 --> 00:04:01,780
cards out as he walked these rural 
streets of Oklahoma.

78
00:04:02,170 --> 00:04:03,003
So I just grew up in this political 
family that was always involved and of 

79
00:04:07,571 --> 00:04:07,851
course,
you know,

80
00:04:07,851 --> 00:04:09,370
involved in student council and,
you know,

81
00:04:09,371 --> 00:04:11,350
in college and Young Republicans know 
all of that.

82
00:04:11,650 --> 00:04:12,483
And so politics has just always been a 
part of my life and I always thought I 

83
00:04:16,061 --> 00:04:21,061
understood politics until I got to 
Washington DC until Hurricane Katrina.

84
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:24,850
And it just gave me an entirely 
different perspective.

85
00:04:25,270 --> 00:04:26,920
But anyway,
long story short,

86
00:04:26,921 --> 00:04:28,270
you know,
I took the typical route,

87
00:04:28,460 --> 00:04:29,950
uh,
graduated from high school to my,

88
00:04:30,340 --> 00:04:32,650
my,
my wife is my childhood sweetheart.

89
00:04:32,651 --> 00:04:34,430
Her Dad actually delivered me.
Wow.

90
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:36,220
That's the kind of small town we grew up
in.

91
00:04:36,250 --> 00:04:36,940
Wow.
Uh,

92
00:04:36,940 --> 00:04:38,350
we've been married for,
Gosh,

93
00:04:38,590 --> 00:04:40,870
40 some years.
I don't want to say how many,

94
00:04:41,190 --> 00:04:42,310
um,
uh,

95
00:04:42,430 --> 00:04:44,000
and,
you know,

96
00:04:44,030 --> 00:04:46,060
went to law school,
raised two children,

97
00:04:46,061 --> 00:04:47,860
very successful,
very,

98
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:51,820
very successful children,
and just had a pretty normal life except

99
00:04:51,821 --> 00:04:52,654
that I knew I wanted to be a lawyer,
but I always had this thought process 

100
00:04:58,930 --> 00:05:02,350
that you never turned down an aisle,
you always looking at an opportunity and

101
00:05:02,351 --> 00:05:03,184
if an opportunity looks good,
you take that opportunity even if it's 

102
00:05:06,671 --> 00:05:08,620
off the path you thought you were going 
to take.

103
00:05:08,980 --> 00:05:11,650
And so that's led me to these 
incredible,

104
00:05:11,950 --> 00:05:16,000
incredible experiences in my life that 
most people don't do because they become

105
00:05:16,001 --> 00:05:18,700
lawyers and all they do is practice law 
their entire life.

106
00:05:18,830 --> 00:05:19,663
That's not me.
So what was the first one of those 

107
00:05:21,611 --> 00:05:22,720
moments when you thought,
wow,

108
00:05:22,721 --> 00:05:23,554
there's a good opportunity?
A little little to the right off that 

109
00:05:26,021 --> 00:05:28,840
exit.
I'm the alum Republican Party,

110
00:05:28,841 --> 00:05:31,630
came to me and asked me to run for 
Congress back in 1988,

111
00:05:31,990 --> 00:05:34,000
promised me all of this money that they 
were going to.

112
00:05:34,001 --> 00:05:35,320
In fact,
that governor,

113
00:05:35,321 --> 00:05:38,860
who was the first Republican governor,
went on to be a US senator and then came

114
00:05:38,861 --> 00:05:40,870
back.
He was a big supporter of me,

115
00:05:40,871 --> 00:05:44,140
but I was running can rebuild them,
former US senator.

116
00:05:44,141 --> 00:05:46,870
He was involved in the Panama Canal 
treaties and everything,

117
00:05:46,871 --> 00:05:47,920
but,
um,

118
00:05:48,330 --> 00:05:50,890
the Oakland Republican Party recruited 
me and said,

119
00:05:51,130 --> 00:05:52,360
come on,
we really want you to run,

120
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:55,930
and so I let ego get in the way.

121
00:05:55,990 --> 00:05:56,823
And I ran against a 12 term Democrat,
incumbent in a gerrymandered district 

122
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:04,610
where I got my butt beat,
but it was,

123
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:07,760
um,
it was an experience that again,

124
00:06:08,330 --> 00:06:09,163
most Americans never do.
Most Americans never throw their hat in 

125
00:06:12,591 --> 00:06:15,560
the ring and actually go out and say,
I'm going to do it.

126
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:19,670
And I would encourage people,
whether it's a city council,

127
00:06:19,700 --> 00:06:21,980
county commissioner,
state representative,

128
00:06:21,981 --> 00:06:22,814
whatever it is,
if you don't like the way things are 

129
00:06:24,111 --> 00:06:25,800
going,
if you're going to bitch about it,

130
00:06:25,801 --> 00:06:26,634
I don't want to hear about it unless 
you're actually involved doing 

131
00:06:28,221 --> 00:06:30,770
something.
Doesn't mean you have to run for office,

132
00:06:30,860 --> 00:06:31,820
but you gotta be involved.

133
00:06:31,930 --> 00:06:32,763
Yeah.
It's so funny after the ringer that 

134
00:06:33,791 --> 00:06:36,280
you've been through,
I guess it's that maybe it's not funny.

135
00:06:36,281 --> 00:06:37,114
It's either ironic or perfectly politik 
that that's still is your message as 

136
00:06:40,121 --> 00:06:40,954
someone that you know,
we sort of put up as as the poster boy 

137
00:06:43,691 --> 00:06:46,300
for everything that's wrong with Dave.
Let me tell you,

138
00:06:46,970 --> 00:06:48,610
it may be poetic,
but it.

139
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:50,910
Sorry,
I should quit pointing to the lawyer.

140
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:53,200
Yeah,
it is.

141
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:58,480
I can tell you so many stories about how
dysfunctional state I've been involved.

142
00:06:58,481 --> 00:07:00,430
I was a city councilman,
A.

143
00:07:00,431 --> 00:07:03,040
I've worked with state legislature as 
the finance director.

144
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:04,433
Then you go on A.
I'm the Under Secretary of Homeland 

145
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:06,993
Security.
I have seen,

146
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:07,953
I have been inside the bowels of the 
government and I can tell you how it 

147
00:07:10,781 --> 00:07:12,880
works and it is not what most American

148
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:15,360
instinct and we're going to get to all 
of that.

149
00:07:15,361 --> 00:07:17,010
So the Under Secretary of Homeland 
Security,

150
00:07:17,011 --> 00:07:18,740
that is the director of Fema,
right.

151
00:07:18,750 --> 00:07:19,583
That's the.
That's just sort of the more technical 

152
00:07:21,031 --> 00:07:21,864
term for that.
Were you involved in the administration 

153
00:07:23,341 --> 00:07:25,590
before nine slash 11 or was it after 
that?

154
00:07:25,591 --> 00:07:27,840
That's when Bush know Peggy for those.

155
00:07:28,420 --> 00:07:29,600
I was there.
Yeah,

156
00:07:29,601 --> 00:07:30,434
and in fact I was in Montana getting 
ready to deliver a speech to the 

157
00:07:33,281 --> 00:07:34,114
national emergency managers association 
about the role of Fema and terrorism on 

158
00:07:38,201 --> 00:07:39,790
nine slash 11,
2011.

159
00:07:40,030 --> 00:07:41,680
So you were the director of him at that 
time?

160
00:07:41,700 --> 00:07:42,533
I was,
I was the general counsel at that time 

161
00:07:44,170 --> 00:07:48,490
and we ended up on a c 1:35
going back to Andrews Air Force Base.

162
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:49,770
Uh,
Joe Wall Ball,

163
00:07:49,780 --> 00:07:51,850
who was the director at the time?
Uh,

164
00:07:51,890 --> 00:07:52,723
immediate went,
went to ground zero on that Wednesday 

165
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:58,900
morning and I went to the White House 
and just spend the next,

166
00:07:59,470 --> 00:08:00,660
gosh,
seems like year,

167
00:08:00,670 --> 00:08:03,160
just day in and day out.
Just planning,

168
00:08:03,460 --> 00:08:05,320
getting ready for we didn't know what.

169
00:08:05,630 --> 00:08:06,463
Yeah.
What's the one thing that really sticks 

170
00:08:08,511 --> 00:08:11,060
out in your mind about that day itself?

171
00:08:13,230 --> 00:08:18,060
For the first time you are flying alone.
There are no planes in the sky.

172
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:19,313
You're flying alone.
Some airman asked me if I went to go 

173
00:08:21,091 --> 00:08:21,924
down in the tanker bay and and just 
watch as we fly across Middle America 

174
00:08:26,220 --> 00:08:27,053
and I'm listening on the,
on the headset and the chatter you hear 

175
00:08:31,740 --> 00:08:32,573
are among the fighter jets that are 
flying around the country and when I 

176
00:08:35,791 --> 00:08:40,791
landed it was not knowing.
It was like there was this blank wall in

177
00:08:42,721 --> 00:08:45,180
front of us.
None of us knew what was going to happen

178
00:08:45,181 --> 00:08:46,014
next and so we meet in the Roosevelt 
Room in the situation room that next 

179
00:08:51,211 --> 00:08:56,211
morning to get briefing by the CIA and 
everybody else and I remember just this,

180
00:08:57,840 --> 00:09:02,840
this quietness in the room that 
everybody knew that none of us knew what

181
00:09:04,921 --> 00:09:06,370
we were facing.
Yeah.

182
00:09:06,660 --> 00:09:07,493
Was there a feeling that George W dot 
Bush was the right guy to handle this 

183
00:09:10,591 --> 00:09:11,424
because for all the frustrations that 
people may have with him and that 

184
00:09:14,071 --> 00:09:16,740
perhaps you have related to some degree 
with Katrina and we can get into that.

185
00:09:16,750 --> 00:09:18,840
Right.
I do remember at the time,

186
00:09:18,900 --> 00:09:20,520
and I lived in New York City at the 
time,

187
00:09:20,521 --> 00:09:21,730
so I was there for nine slash 11.
Right.

188
00:09:21,770 --> 00:09:22,980
Family was there.
My grandma was there,

189
00:09:22,981 --> 00:09:24,060
my,
my dad,

190
00:09:24,390 --> 00:09:27,810
um,
I do remember that between George w Bush

191
00:09:27,811 --> 00:09:29,580
at the time,
but particularly Giuliani,

192
00:09:30,150 --> 00:09:30,983
I think there was at least a feeling 
that these guys are sort of the right 

193
00:09:33,451 --> 00:09:36,330
people to be handling this at the time.
Certainly Giuliani,

194
00:09:36,331 --> 00:09:38,190
at least from a New Yorker's 
perspective.

195
00:09:38,191 --> 00:09:39,540
Did you,
did you feel that,

196
00:09:39,541 --> 00:09:41,300
did people feel that within the 
government that,

197
00:09:41,310 --> 00:09:42,143
like,
that Bush was kind of able to handle 

198
00:09:43,651 --> 00:09:45,250
this or have the right skillset to 
handle this?

199
00:09:45,251 --> 00:09:48,450
Yes,
it was for me it was more than most.

200
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:50,160
Um,
I mean,

201
00:09:50,161 --> 00:09:55,161
I can still remember vividly that in the
Roosevelt Room you've got Colin Powell,

202
00:09:55,591 --> 00:10:00,150
you got Donald Rumsfeld,
Condi Rice shouldn't have andy card,

203
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:01,980
so you have all these heavy hitters.

204
00:10:02,190 --> 00:10:04,290
And then here's little old me sitting at
the table too.

205
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:07,200
And I remember watching because I just,
I'm an,

206
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:08,153
I'm an observer of people and I remember
watching all of them and there was none 

207
00:10:12,601 --> 00:10:13,434
of the usual because I had been in these
meetings before and there was none of 

208
00:10:15,181 --> 00:10:16,140
the usual,
hey,

209
00:10:16,141 --> 00:10:18,090
how you do?
And everybody was at the table.

210
00:10:18,091 --> 00:10:20,610
Everybody was reading their briefing,
everybody was trying to understand.

211
00:10:20,940 --> 00:10:24,480
We know that we always referred to the 
president as the boss.

212
00:10:24,810 --> 00:10:25,643
We know the boss is going to ask some 
tough questions and we know we're not 

213
00:10:28,291 --> 00:10:30,900
going to have answers and that's indeed 
what happened.

214
00:10:31,220 --> 00:10:33,390
Know we had theories,
we have ideas,

215
00:10:33,391 --> 00:10:34,224
we have plans,
but nobody really knew for certain what 

216
00:10:36,811 --> 00:10:37,561
was next.
Yeah.

217
00:10:37,561 --> 00:10:38,394
And especially in those first few days 
where we didn't know if another attack 

218
00:10:39,961 --> 00:10:44,820
was coming or anything like what was 
actually the job of Fema for those first

219
00:10:44,821 --> 00:10:45,654
few days.

220
00:10:45,690 --> 00:10:47,380
We are,
um,

221
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:50,370
we're the nation's federal first 
responder.

222
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:53,190
We coordinate all of,
for example,

223
00:10:53,191 --> 00:10:54,024
if the Pentagon ground zero,
our job was to make sure that we have 

224
00:10:56,430 --> 00:10:59,010
all the urban search and rescue teams 
deployed,

225
00:10:59,550 --> 00:11:02,100
that we take care of the firefighters,
we provide all the equipment,

226
00:11:02,101 --> 00:11:04,680
we provide the training,
we do all of that stuff.

227
00:11:04,681 --> 00:11:05,514
So our job was to clean up ground zero.
Our job was at the Pentagon to help 

228
00:11:08,941 --> 00:11:09,774
clean that up.
And what was fascinating about it was 

229
00:11:13,050 --> 00:11:16,470
normally you go to a disaster.
It's not also a crime scene,

230
00:11:16,830 --> 00:11:17,663
but in this case,
both the Pentagon and in and in and in 

231
00:11:20,850 --> 00:11:23,070
Pennsylvania and obviously in ground 
zero,

232
00:11:23,430 --> 00:11:24,263
they were also crime scenes,
so we now had to coordinate talking 

233
00:11:27,081 --> 00:11:28,980
about federalism.
So now we had to coordinate,

234
00:11:29,070 --> 00:11:30,090
you know,
the federal government,

235
00:11:30,091 --> 00:11:31,500
state government,
local government,

236
00:11:31,790 --> 00:11:34,170
and on top of that we had to coordinate 
with the CIA,

237
00:11:34,171 --> 00:11:35,940
the FBI,
the NSA,

238
00:11:35,941 --> 00:11:38,730
and everybody else who's doing all of 
the forensic work.

239
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,320
How does that go?
I mean,

240
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:41,393
one of the things we talk about here a 
lot is sort of the unwieldy giant 

241
00:11:43,681 --> 00:11:44,514
government we have right now,
sort of all the middlemen and 

242
00:11:46,021 --> 00:11:47,690
bureaucrats.
They get in the way of everything.

243
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:48,910
I mean,
how did it really go up?

244
00:11:48,930 --> 00:11:51,060
That's your job.
Here's what's fascinating.

245
00:11:51,810 --> 00:11:55,330
When the governments under pressure like
that,

246
00:11:56,170 --> 00:11:57,003
everybody does what you have to meet.
My mother in law had to say that drove 

247
00:12:00,011 --> 00:12:01,450
my drives,
my wife crazy shoot,

248
00:12:01,540 --> 00:12:02,680
she's now deceased,
but it was,

249
00:12:02,950 --> 00:12:03,783
you know,
sometimes you just have to do what you 

250
00:12:04,391 --> 00:12:08,290
have to do and when,
when a crisis hits of that magnitude,

251
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:11,380
it's all hands on deck and if you need 
to break the rules,

252
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:13,660
people are willing to break the rules to
make things happen.

253
00:12:14,020 --> 00:12:15,700
So I would say that in,
in,

254
00:12:15,730 --> 00:12:16,563
in those intense moments,
that's probably when the government 

255
00:12:19,571 --> 00:12:20,404
tends to do the best job because 
everybody's trying their hardest to do 

256
00:12:25,271 --> 00:12:26,530
what's best for the country.

257
00:12:26,770 --> 00:12:27,603
Yeah.
So how soon after that did a debbie tap 

258
00:12:31,601 --> 00:12:34,300
you to be the head of FEMA?
Uh,

259
00:12:34,330 --> 00:12:35,410
let's see.
So,

260
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:36,333
uh,
shortly after I became the deputy 

261
00:12:37,271 --> 00:12:39,130
director,
I would say like just a couple of months

262
00:12:39,130 --> 00:12:39,963
later,
I went from general counsel to deputy 

263
00:12:41,051 --> 00:12:41,884
director of when they announced the 
creation of the department will story 

264
00:12:45,701 --> 00:12:50,050
about the creation of dhs.
So they're going to create the DHS.

265
00:12:50,260 --> 00:12:51,093
So w points me to the transition team,
we're one of five people putting 

266
00:12:54,491 --> 00:12:55,324
together the department.
And I apologized to the nation for that 

267
00:12:57,551 --> 00:13:00,190
because I've got lots of regrets about 
dhs.

268
00:13:00,210 --> 00:13:02,560
I'm happy to talk.
We will.

269
00:13:02,830 --> 00:13:03,663
Um,
and then soon thereafter all ball left 

270
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:08,860
and that's when I became the under 
secretary and the director of Fema.

271
00:13:08,861 --> 00:13:10,450
So probably within,
Gosh,

272
00:13:10,510 --> 00:13:11,500
a year.
Yeah.

273
00:13:11,580 --> 00:13:12,740
Oh.
And then just,

274
00:13:13,020 --> 00:13:14,290
it's the mailman story.
You know,

275
00:13:14,291 --> 00:13:15,940
you start in the mail room and you work 
your way up.

276
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,620
Yeah.
And on the two years after that,

277
00:13:17,900 --> 00:13:20,320
then the other crisis,
certainly.

278
00:13:20,620 --> 00:13:21,453
So tell me a little bit about your 
regrets creating the Department of 

279
00:13:24,550 --> 00:13:25,383
Homeland Security.
Here's a backstory first that most 

280
00:13:26,891 --> 00:13:27,724
people don't know.
The administration was opposed to the 

281
00:13:29,231 --> 00:13:31,330
creation of the department.
We thought it was a mistake,

282
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:32,193
huge mistake.
We're going to create this massive 

283
00:13:33,971 --> 00:13:34,804
bureaucracy,
why things are working the way they're 

284
00:13:35,921 --> 00:13:36,754
supposed to work.
But Congress felt this political desire 

285
00:13:40,630 --> 00:13:42,430
that you have to be seen doing 
something.

286
00:13:42,790 --> 00:13:44,230
So once congress said,
hey,

287
00:13:44,231 --> 00:13:48,190
we're going to move forward with 
legislation than the White House says,

288
00:13:48,191 --> 00:13:49,024
oh my God,
now we've got to get in front of this 

289
00:13:50,950 --> 00:13:54,190
because we want to control it and mold 
it in our own view,

290
00:13:54,191 --> 00:13:57,130
not congress's view,
because in effect they don't want to get

291
00:13:57,160 --> 00:14:01,730
legislation put on his desk that he lido
and then it's like he's against almost.

292
00:14:01,990 --> 00:14:02,840
Exactly.
So.

293
00:14:03,070 --> 00:14:06,620
So our job was an example of how screwed
so,

294
00:14:06,690 --> 00:14:09,970
so I'm thrown me and four other guys 
with Clay Johnson,

295
00:14:09,971 --> 00:14:11,860
the president's best friend,
college roommate,

296
00:14:12,190 --> 00:14:13,023
a deputy director of omb were thrown 
together to create this massive new 

297
00:14:15,821 --> 00:14:18,700
bureaucracy by taking 22 different 
cultures,

298
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:19,593
22 different cultures,
22 different organizations and throwing 

299
00:14:22,421 --> 00:14:24,340
them in together and trying to make it 
work.

300
00:14:24,520 --> 00:14:26,370
What are a couple of those organizations
that were thrown in there?

301
00:14:26,371 --> 00:14:27,071
I mean,
it's everybody,

302
00:14:27,071 --> 00:14:27,670
right?
Well,

303
00:14:27,670 --> 00:14:29,800
it was secret secret service.
What the hell,

304
00:14:29,801 --> 00:14:32,090
Secret Service and homeland security.
Uh,

305
00:14:32,230 --> 00:14:33,650
the,
the coast guard,

306
00:14:33,820 --> 00:14:37,690
the coast guard has this kind of 
schizophrenia role.

307
00:14:37,900 --> 00:14:38,733
They've worked for homeland security,
yet they're subjected to the military 

308
00:14:41,501 --> 00:14:42,334
code of conduct and they kind of 
technical work for pimp for the 

309
00:14:44,051 --> 00:14:45,940
Pentagon,
so we've got all of the.

310
00:14:46,410 --> 00:14:47,243
You've got that,
you have ice customs and border patrol 

311
00:14:49,300 --> 00:14:50,133
immigration,
a different grants from the Department 

312
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:54,913
of Justice Fema.

313
00:14:55,310 --> 00:14:56,143
Everybody had a different culture and my
objection was you can't throw different 

314
00:15:02,511 --> 00:15:06,960
cultures together and really expect them
to work either in the short term and the

315
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:08,840
longterm.
Every organization,

316
00:15:08,870 --> 00:15:09,980
corporate,
private,

317
00:15:10,010 --> 00:15:10,843
governmental has a culture and trying to
meld those is the one of the most 

318
00:15:13,911 --> 00:15:15,540
difficult things to do.
Look,

319
00:15:15,890 --> 00:15:18,440
I love Carly Fiorina.
Consider her a friend,

320
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:19,633
but they brought in to talk to us about 
how to do mergers and acquisitions and 

321
00:15:24,501 --> 00:15:25,700
I'm thinking,
wait a minute,

322
00:15:26,690 --> 00:15:27,523
the HP and merger and acquisition,
that didn't seem to go too well and 

323
00:15:30,681 --> 00:15:33,770
you're going to tell us how to do this 
22 government agency thing.

324
00:15:33,980 --> 00:15:35,060
I mean,
that's one objection.

325
00:15:35,420 --> 00:15:37,350
The second objection was,
you know,

326
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:38,233
we got to airports with a major concern 
and for whatever reason we wanted to 

327
00:15:42,771 --> 00:15:43,604
blame the private contractors who have a
vested interest in making sure that the 

328
00:15:46,821 --> 00:15:48,050
airlines are secure,
right?

329
00:15:48,410 --> 00:15:50,330
But that's not good enough.
Instead,

330
00:15:50,510 --> 00:15:51,343
let's fire all of them and let's create 
this massive new bureaucracy called the 

331
00:15:54,321 --> 00:15:56,690
Tsa.
And I'm,

332
00:15:56,780 --> 00:15:57,613
I'm like the kid in the back of the 
classroom that keeps raising his hand 

333
00:16:00,411 --> 00:16:03,790
and say,
but professor y w,

334
00:16:03,980 --> 00:16:05,870
how's that gonna work?
Um,

335
00:16:06,590 --> 00:16:09,740
but there was just this way.
What would happen when he said something

336
00:16:09,741 --> 00:16:12,080
like that?
Because now I think in 2018,

337
00:16:12,081 --> 00:16:14,000
if you say something about the Tsa,
most people that agree with you,

338
00:16:14,020 --> 00:16:19,020
that really ridiculous,
the reaction was always,

339
00:16:19,910 --> 00:16:20,743
well,
we're going to meet your objection by 

340
00:16:22,131 --> 00:16:22,964
doing y.
and I had been around the block long 

341
00:16:26,571 --> 00:16:27,404
enough to know that that answer was bs.
But when you're the one person out of 

342
00:16:31,041 --> 00:16:32,610
five,
you're out voted.

343
00:16:32,690 --> 00:16:34,550
So you,
you,

344
00:16:34,970 --> 00:16:35,803
you tend to.
There's a great Washington Post story 

345
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:41,120
that talks about brown as the 
bureaucratic infighter.

346
00:16:41,660 --> 00:16:45,830
And I was in the post,
writes it as if that's a bad thing and I

347
00:16:45,850 --> 00:16:46,683
considered a badge of honor because I 
was fighting for just the reality that 

348
00:16:51,140 --> 00:16:51,973
when you tell me that putting these,
deploy these different agencies 

349
00:16:54,531 --> 00:16:56,120
together,
there's going to be budget neutral.

350
00:16:56,180 --> 00:16:57,013
That's BS.
When you tell me you're going to create 

351
00:16:58,671 --> 00:16:59,504
Tsa,
but you're going to prevent them from 

352
00:17:01,130 --> 00:17:01,963
ever being a union.
That's bs because I just know how 

353
00:17:04,641 --> 00:17:08,930
government metastasizes.
And so the TSA has turned out to be what

354
00:17:08,931 --> 00:17:11,990
I thought it was the dysfunction within 
dhs.

355
00:17:12,290 --> 00:17:16,730
While it may be minimally better,
it's still a dysfunctional organization.

356
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,370
So let's back up for a second,
because you mentioned that before this,

357
00:17:19,371 --> 00:17:20,204
the security.
Was it all done by private companies 

358
00:17:22,071 --> 00:17:24,410
before the TSA?
That's almost hard to believe.

359
00:17:24,510 --> 00:17:26,750
Or was it all done by private?
Yes.

360
00:17:27,390 --> 00:17:27,790
The,
uh,

361
00:17:27,790 --> 00:17:28,623
the airlines who have,
who has the most now you think about 

362
00:17:31,401 --> 00:17:35,300
just trying to figure out what's the 
best way to put a program together.

363
00:17:35,540 --> 00:17:36,373
Well,
who has the most interest in making 

364
00:17:38,841 --> 00:17:43,280
certain that they're planes are never 
hijacked or flown into buildings.

365
00:17:43,550 --> 00:17:44,720
Oh,
the airlines.

366
00:17:45,110 --> 00:17:48,530
Why don't we let them decide security,
because what do they have?

367
00:17:48,530 --> 00:17:51,180
Competing interests.
They want to make sure that their planes

368
00:17:51,181 --> 00:17:53,640
are secure,
their passengers are safe,

369
00:17:53,700 --> 00:17:57,000
but that the security operates in the 
most efficient and effective way.

370
00:17:57,420 --> 00:17:58,253
Now you tell me government's going to 
care about those three things be as 

371
00:18:01,550 --> 00:18:02,383
well.
It's also interesting because it's like 

372
00:18:03,121 --> 00:18:03,954
what a great lady used competition in 
the right sense where it's like this 

373
00:18:06,871 --> 00:18:09,420
airline that's doing it the right way 
where they could go,

374
00:18:09,421 --> 00:18:11,760
you know what?
Look at our marks on security,

375
00:18:11,761 --> 00:18:12,594
so we're charging you $5 more than a lot
of people wouldn't have a problem with 

376
00:18:14,791 --> 00:18:15,710
it.
It would.

377
00:18:15,770 --> 00:18:16,603
It would be a beautiful thing.
I didn't realize that it was fully 

378
00:18:18,271 --> 00:18:20,010
private before that.
Yes.

379
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:21,590
Wow.
So any other.

380
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:25,380
I mean that's a pretty big issue,
but any other big regrets related to.

381
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:26,970
Well,
for example,

382
00:18:27,030 --> 00:18:31,320
we have within fema what was called the 
catastrophic disaster response group.

383
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:33,000
Everything is an acronym,
so it was,

384
00:18:33,050 --> 00:18:38,050
it was the Crg and because the FEMA 
director under under federal law,

385
00:18:38,820 --> 00:18:42,660
when in times of disaster reports 
directly to the president,

386
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:45,900
you're the of representative,
so this cdr,

387
00:18:45,901 --> 00:18:47,670
gee,
when there was a disaster,

388
00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:48,533
like nine slash 11,
we brought all of the cabinet 

389
00:18:50,491 --> 00:18:51,324
departments and agencies together,
so usually had the deputy secretaries 

390
00:18:54,510 --> 00:18:55,343
there because they were there on behalf 
of their bosses and we would deconflict 

391
00:18:59,911 --> 00:19:00,744
policy.
We would set priorities and if State 

392
00:19:05,310 --> 00:19:06,143
Department wanted to do one thing,
but dod you wanted to do another and ag 

393
00:19:08,821 --> 00:19:09,654
wanted to do something else.
That was where we got all of those 

394
00:19:11,761 --> 00:19:12,594
deconflicted because the FEMA director 
had the authority of the president 

395
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:19,030
sitting in that room.
Well,

396
00:19:19,260 --> 00:19:20,093
that's gone away now and you've thrown 
these all together and I've always said 

397
00:19:24,330 --> 00:19:25,163
if you want to find out whether a 
disaster is being handled properly or 

398
00:19:28,711 --> 00:19:29,940
not,
or any sort of crisis,

399
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:32,460
this could be in the private sector to 
ask this question,

400
00:19:33,060 --> 00:19:33,893
who's in charge?

401
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:37,560
If you can't answer the question,
who's in charge,

402
00:19:37,830 --> 00:19:41,970
then it's a cluster.
Is there an inherent sort of.

403
00:19:42,260 --> 00:19:43,093
There's a conflict here which is that 
basically you're taking government 

404
00:19:45,271 --> 00:19:49,170
people and for someone like you that 
maybe wanted less government,

405
00:19:49,410 --> 00:19:50,243
and I think this is what you're really 
saying about Bush at the beginning of 

406
00:19:52,360 --> 00:19:53,280
this.
I didn't want this,

407
00:19:53,281 --> 00:19:54,440
the administration,
he didn't write it,

408
00:19:54,850 --> 00:19:55,683
but government,
and this is the problem with 

409
00:19:56,731 --> 00:19:59,550
Libertarians in general,
like people that want less government.

410
00:19:59,551 --> 00:20:00,540
Well,
if you're in the government,

411
00:20:00,541 --> 00:20:02,460
it's hard to look around the office and 
be like,

412
00:20:02,461 --> 00:20:03,151
guys,
you know,

413
00:20:03,151 --> 00:20:04,950
most of us probably shouldn't even be 
here.

414
00:20:05,180 --> 00:20:05,710
You know,
we're,

415
00:20:05,710 --> 00:20:06,543
we're going to need new jobs guys.
So in Fema first started in 1979 under 

416
00:20:09,931 --> 00:20:10,764
Jimmy Carter,
they had a policy of providing ice to 

417
00:20:13,351 --> 00:20:17,550
hospitals so that lactating mothers had 
a place where they could keep milk,

418
00:20:17,850 --> 00:20:18,683
where you could keep insulin and other 
medicines that require pharmaceuticals 

419
00:20:21,321 --> 00:20:22,530
or require refrigeration.

420
00:20:22,890 --> 00:20:23,723
That ice was for hospitals to provide 
their local communities a place for the 

421
00:20:27,241 --> 00:20:31,950
medicines to say stay cool and safe and 
everything else that has metastasized,

422
00:20:31,951 --> 00:20:32,784
which is my favorite word of government.
It has metastasized now to where in a 

423
00:20:36,211 --> 00:20:39,030
disaster we,
we provide every Tom,

424
00:20:39,031 --> 00:20:39,864
Dick and Harry two bags of ice so that 
they can keep their hamburger cold or 

425
00:20:42,681 --> 00:20:46,380
there or the coors beer cold.
And I went to Congress and said,

426
00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:47,453
this is out control.
We're spending tens of millions of 

427
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:54,460
dollars on ice so that a private citizen
can keep their food cold.

428
00:20:54,490 --> 00:20:55,323
Is that really a government function?
Even talking to conservatives on the 

429
00:20:59,471 --> 00:21:00,304
hill,
let alone Democrats or liberals or 

430
00:21:02,231 --> 00:21:07,180
anybody else.
I was a heretic because we can't support

431
00:21:07,181 --> 00:21:10,240
that because that's taking something 
away from our constituents.

432
00:21:10,790 --> 00:21:13,810
Would you reckon that you realize it's a
waste?

433
00:21:13,811 --> 00:21:15,910
Right?
Why should we be doing that?

434
00:21:16,120 --> 00:21:17,290
Well,
we can't stop it now.

435
00:21:17,740 --> 00:21:20,020
Yeah,
it's fascinating.

436
00:21:20,021 --> 00:21:22,210
And then you just get all these sort of 
middle management,

437
00:21:22,510 --> 00:21:23,800
Kratz men.
No,

438
00:21:23,910 --> 00:21:25,230
nobody's going to give up that.
Right.

439
00:21:25,540 --> 00:21:26,400
So,
uh,

440
00:21:26,410 --> 00:21:27,243
was there anything else major between,
for you professionally between nine 

441
00:21:30,431 --> 00:21:32,380
slash 11 and Katrina,
like what were,

442
00:21:32,381 --> 00:21:33,214
what were you doing before that was 
instilled chess related and we had the 

443
00:21:37,061 --> 00:21:37,894
Columbia space shuttle disaster,
which we had to coordinate with NASA 

444
00:21:40,121 --> 00:21:43,390
because NASA was in shock.
So we had to help them do all the search

445
00:21:43,391 --> 00:21:44,224
and rescue from California to Texas.
We had a huge wildfires in California 

446
00:21:49,211 --> 00:21:52,660
that were just massive.
Luckily they've recently experienced,

447
00:21:52,661 --> 00:21:55,540
we had fires throughout the west,
flooding in the Midwest.

448
00:21:55,541 --> 00:21:58,900
We had the tsunami in Southeast Asia.
I mean I could go on and on and on.

449
00:21:59,080 --> 00:21:59,913
Yes.
My life was just full of hell from nine 

450
00:22:01,421 --> 00:22:02,050
slash 11 on.

451
00:22:02,050 --> 00:22:05,590
So until that,
until the Katrina moment.

452
00:22:05,591 --> 00:22:08,260
Yes.
What was the general feeling about you?

453
00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:11,740
Because then now we'll get into this 
where you were then used as.

454
00:22:11,770 --> 00:22:12,640
Well,
I was competent,

455
00:22:12,650 --> 00:22:15,370
knew what I was doing.
The White House always turned to me to,

456
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:16,990
to get things done.
Uh,

457
00:22:17,950 --> 00:22:19,780
it.
Yeah.

458
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:20,621
Okay.
So I'll,

459
00:22:20,621 --> 00:22:21,900
I'll take,
I'll take it,

460
00:22:22,150 --> 00:22:22,983
I'll take your word for it.
But by and large you were thought of as 

461
00:22:24,551 --> 00:22:27,310
a competent executive.
And everything was okay,

462
00:22:27,311 --> 00:22:28,690
so now,
now feeding habits.

463
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:31,060
I love the story that you told right at 
the beginning because what a,

464
00:22:31,330 --> 00:22:35,050
what a perfect story of like just awful 
abusive power.

465
00:22:35,051 --> 00:22:37,360
Go check out my home instead of,
you know,

466
00:22:37,370 --> 00:22:38,203
the,
the disaster areas and all that kind of 

467
00:22:39,401 --> 00:22:40,720
stuff.
Uh,

468
00:22:40,780 --> 00:22:41,613
how does it,
how does it,

469
00:22:41,770 --> 00:22:42,603
there was a certain amount of time we 
knew that this thing was going to be a 

470
00:22:45,790 --> 00:22:46,450
crazy,
right?

471
00:22:46,450 --> 00:22:47,980
I mean,
how long before it happened?

472
00:22:47,981 --> 00:22:48,814
It was going to be crazy because we had,
I had gone to Congress and ask for an 

473
00:22:51,671 --> 00:22:52,504
appropriation.
I actually wanted to spend some tax 

474
00:22:54,521 --> 00:22:59,230
money to plan for 10 truly catastrophic 
disasters.

475
00:22:59,560 --> 00:23:01,030
Something like a hurricane.
You,

476
00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:04,210
your former New Yorker.
Can you imagine a category five going up

477
00:23:04,211 --> 00:23:05,044
the Hudson river?
Can you imagine something happening to 

478
00:23:07,481 --> 00:23:12,070
the LNG natural gas,
a port in Boston,

479
00:23:12,340 --> 00:23:13,173
a terrorist incident there.
Imagine the big one hitting California 

480
00:23:15,971 --> 00:23:19,850
or the new magid fault.
Imagine because New Orleans a Fishbowl,

481
00:23:19,860 --> 00:23:20,693
a category five filling up New Orleans.
So Congress had given me money to start 

482
00:23:23,951 --> 00:23:26,350
doing catastrophic planning for these 
kinds of things.

483
00:23:27,010 --> 00:23:27,843
New Orleans was the first one we picked 
and when we did a tabletop exercise to 

484
00:23:33,371 --> 00:23:37,660
see if we could coordinate the response,
the table top exercise fell apart,

485
00:23:37,661 --> 00:23:41,170
Dave,
so I knew probably nine,

486
00:23:41,180 --> 00:23:44,950
12 months before Katrina actually 
occurred that we weren't ready.

487
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:46,033
So what does that actually mean when 
you're doing a table top exercise that 

488
00:23:47,841 --> 00:23:48,674
that's just coordinating all the,
all the players in the room and you 

489
00:23:52,071 --> 00:23:54,680
pretend like you're going through a 
disaster.

490
00:23:54,860 --> 00:23:56,030
So what?
What are you doing?

491
00:23:56,060 --> 00:23:57,170
What are you doing?
What are you doing?

492
00:23:57,171 --> 00:24:00,110
What are the conflicts?
How do we deconflict all of these policy

493
00:24:00,111 --> 00:24:02,000
issues?
Do we have enough food?

494
00:24:02,001 --> 00:24:06,290
How do we get dod to dod?
Have enough equipment on hand,

495
00:24:06,330 --> 00:24:08,210
Gideon food supplies and everything 
else.

496
00:24:08,450 --> 00:24:13,450
You exercise that around the table and 
Louisiana fell apart.

497
00:24:14,600 --> 00:24:15,770
Yeah.
Wouldn't work.

498
00:24:16,520 --> 00:24:20,930
Was it right at the beginning of it that
you realized how severe it was?

499
00:24:21,230 --> 00:24:25,250
I've been criticized because in May of 
2005,

500
00:24:25,460 --> 00:24:28,310
I had my wife.
This is before.

501
00:24:28,380 --> 00:24:29,970
Before busy for Katrina?
Yeah.

502
00:24:30,140 --> 00:24:32,750
It may of 2005.
Several Friends of mine,

503
00:24:32,751 --> 00:24:34,790
including Colin Powell,
had said,

504
00:24:34,910 --> 00:24:37,640
you know what?
It's probably time to leave and I,

505
00:24:37,700 --> 00:24:38,780
I asked them,
seriously,

506
00:24:38,781 --> 00:24:39,614
why is it,
well,

507
00:24:40,280 --> 00:24:45,280
you've done everything that you can do 
in terms of trying to mold dhs into what

508
00:24:45,771 --> 00:24:49,370
you think it should be and nothing else 
is going to happen.

509
00:24:49,460 --> 00:24:52,640
It is what it is that you have.
You have fought the good fight.

510
00:24:52,940 --> 00:24:54,860
Uh,
you've been here six years,

511
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:56,900
you know,
and of course my wife was,

512
00:24:56,920 --> 00:24:57,753
we,
it's time to go back to Colorado to go 

513
00:24:58,611 --> 00:25:01,580
back to Colorado.
And so I told Andy Card,

514
00:25:02,030 --> 00:25:02,863
the White House chief of staff in 
malleable five that I wanted to resign 

515
00:25:06,531 --> 00:25:10,040
and go back to Colorado.
And what typically happens,

516
00:25:10,610 --> 00:25:11,443
Andy said,
can you wait till Labor Day and go 

517
00:25:15,531 --> 00:25:16,364
through one more hurricane season for us
and that will give us time to find a 

518
00:25:19,701 --> 00:25:20,534
replacement.
Now when the president asks you to stay 

519
00:25:22,581 --> 00:25:24,680
for five more months,
sure,

520
00:25:24,740 --> 00:25:26,720
I can do that,
man.

521
00:25:27,170 --> 00:25:27,881
Labor Day.
What?

522
00:25:27,881 --> 00:25:29,930
What was the day that Katrina hit?
It was August 29th.

523
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:32,380
August 29 Labor Day,
whatever it is,

524
00:25:32,990 --> 00:25:34,830
eight days later.
Um,

525
00:25:34,910 --> 00:25:35,540
okay.
So,

526
00:25:35,540 --> 00:25:36,920
so it hits.
I mean,

527
00:25:36,921 --> 00:25:39,980
I can remember watching everything on 
CNN at the time.

528
00:25:40,220 --> 00:25:41,150
Uh,
you mentioned Nagan.

529
00:25:41,151 --> 00:25:42,730
Who is the mayor?
Uh,

530
00:25:43,290 --> 00:25:44,610
mayor of New Orleans.
Lauren's.

531
00:25:45,800 --> 00:25:47,930
How chaotic was it to coordinate?
You've already,

532
00:25:47,990 --> 00:25:51,120
after you said this,
this initial test had failed about.

533
00:25:51,210 --> 00:25:52,880
It was for.
It was a,

534
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:56,990
it was virtually impossible.
So I landed the superdome.

535
00:25:57,020 --> 00:25:57,950
The superdome.
Well,

536
00:25:57,970 --> 00:25:58,803
let's,
let's go back a step before I actually 

537
00:26:02,031 --> 00:26:05,510
went to New Orleans before the storm 
made landfall,

538
00:26:06,020 --> 00:26:06,853
Max Mayfield,
who was the director of the National 

539
00:26:08,990 --> 00:26:12,290
Hurricane Center fellow Okie.
He and I go on the phone together and we

540
00:26:12,291 --> 00:26:13,124
knew how bad the storm is going to be,
but we could not get the attention of 

541
00:26:16,550 --> 00:26:17,383
state officials and frankly we couldn't 
get the attention of the dod and State 

542
00:26:22,670 --> 00:26:23,503
Department,
other people that would be playing a 

543
00:26:23,891 --> 00:26:24,980
role.
How is that possible?

544
00:26:24,981 --> 00:26:25,814
You now had this new dhs that was 
supposed to be cool because who's in 

545
00:26:30,201 --> 00:26:31,820
charge?
I remember who's in charge.

546
00:26:32,180 --> 00:26:33,013
Well,
everybody's now competing for their 

547
00:26:35,240 --> 00:26:36,980
pecking order because of dhs.

548
00:26:37,700 --> 00:26:40,410
So I tell Max Mayfield,
would you please explain this?

549
00:26:40,411 --> 00:26:43,680
I'm going to have bushes and Crawford.
He'll be on civic call,

550
00:26:43,681 --> 00:26:48,030
this top secret phone conference,
video and everything,

551
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:51,570
and I'll have the mayor,
the governor of all the Gulf states,

552
00:26:51,571 --> 00:26:56,280
their job will be there for Florida a 
and I need you to read them the riot act

553
00:26:56,460 --> 00:26:59,430
about how bad this is going to be,
and he did,

554
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:01,073
and then I pulled out an engineering 
report that said the New Orleans 

555
00:27:04,770 --> 00:27:05,603
superdome cannot even withstand a 
category three based upon engineering 

556
00:27:08,521 --> 00:27:09,354
reports,
and the mayor just announced that he's 

557
00:27:10,921 --> 00:27:13,260
going to use the superdome is a shelter 
of last resort.

558
00:27:13,650 --> 00:27:16,260
I'm screaming on this call and you can't
do that.

559
00:27:16,261 --> 00:27:17,490
That's a huge mistake.
Blah,

560
00:27:17,491 --> 00:27:18,300
blah,
blah.

561
00:27:18,300 --> 00:27:19,133
At this point,
what?

562
00:27:19,140 --> 00:27:20,820
What category did they think it was 
gonna be?

563
00:27:20,850 --> 00:27:22,980
We thought it was gonna be a fight when 
it actually hit.

564
00:27:22,980 --> 00:27:23,813
It was a three,
but as we all know is still ripped off 

565
00:27:26,221 --> 00:27:28,720
the roof of the.
Of the superdome?

566
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:30,330
No.
So I knew going in,

567
00:27:30,331 --> 00:27:31,164
it was gonna be bad.
I say all that to lead to this one 

568
00:27:33,091 --> 00:27:33,924
point,
the day that I'm leaving to fly to to 

569
00:27:38,050 --> 00:27:40,560
baton rouge.
I remember exactly where I was.

570
00:27:40,561 --> 00:27:42,470
I was on one 95 going around the,
uh,

571
00:27:42,560 --> 00:27:43,393
the Pentagon and I called Joe Hagan,
the deputy chief of staff to telling 

572
00:27:46,770 --> 00:27:49,050
that I'm headed to Andrews.
I'm going down,

573
00:27:49,051 --> 00:27:51,030
we're doing everything we can and I 
said,

574
00:27:51,031 --> 00:27:51,864
Joe,
but this is going to be a cluster 

575
00:27:52,981 --> 00:27:55,830
because I can't get stuff coordinated 
now.

576
00:27:56,070 --> 00:27:56,903
And the storm hasn't even hit.
And because I had already told them I 

577
00:27:59,971 --> 00:28:03,870
wanted to leave.
I said in an email to the and hey,

578
00:28:03,871 --> 00:28:07,350
can I quit now?
And of course everybody picks it up.

579
00:28:07,380 --> 00:28:09,060
Oh look,
Brown doesn't care.

580
00:28:09,300 --> 00:28:10,133
He's,
he wants to quit before the storm even 

581
00:28:11,310 --> 00:28:12,360
hit.
That's fascinating.

582
00:28:12,361 --> 00:28:13,290
I mean,
I remember that.

583
00:28:13,430 --> 00:28:14,520
Sure.
I remember that.

584
00:28:14,521 --> 00:28:16,070
Yeah.
And um,

585
00:28:17,210 --> 00:28:18,870
I mean,
you were just being sarcastic.

586
00:28:19,150 --> 00:28:20,550
I'm a sarcastic guy.
Yeah.

587
00:28:20,700 --> 00:28:21,533
I'm a total smart ass.
And so I had already agreed to stay 

588
00:28:26,281 --> 00:28:27,114
through Labor Day.
I knew I was walking into a buzzsaw and 

589
00:28:29,521 --> 00:28:30,840
I'm telling Hagen,
Hey,

590
00:28:30,841 --> 00:28:32,430
can I quit now?
And of course,

591
00:28:32,431 --> 00:28:33,630
the New York Times,
you know,

592
00:28:33,870 --> 00:28:35,220
for years,
all of my emails,

593
00:28:35,221 --> 00:28:38,150
they see the jokes that I crack because 
let me tell you something,

594
00:28:39,090 --> 00:28:41,580
not to get off the subject here go,
but when,

595
00:28:41,940 --> 00:28:46,940
when people are suffering and people 
that are the rescue workers,

596
00:28:47,020 --> 00:28:47,853
the firefighters that are taking people 
off roofs that are taking them out of 

597
00:28:51,570 --> 00:28:54,030
flooded homes,
they're working their asses off,

598
00:28:54,300 --> 00:28:56,100
they're tired,
they're worn out,

599
00:28:56,130 --> 00:28:56,963
they're stressed out.
You know what the best thing to do is 

600
00:28:59,580 --> 00:29:00,690
give them a little humor.

601
00:29:00,810 --> 00:29:01,980
Yeah,
show them.

602
00:29:02,370 --> 00:29:05,960
Show a little humanity.
It's my father in law was a smoke,

603
00:29:06,030 --> 00:29:06,970
told you,
delivered me,

604
00:29:06,971 --> 00:29:07,804
and he was a surgeon.
He used to talk about how he would 

605
00:29:10,110 --> 00:29:10,943
relieve stress in the our by cracking 
jokes and I've always thought that the 

606
00:29:16,201 --> 00:29:17,034
best way to manage people in a time of 
stress is to remind them of their 

607
00:29:20,701 --> 00:29:22,980
humanity.
Make them laugh,

608
00:29:23,250 --> 00:29:24,083
and if they can laugh for five seconds,
that gets the endorphins running and 

609
00:29:27,571 --> 00:29:30,060
they can go out and keep working 24 
hours a day,

610
00:29:30,061 --> 00:29:33,150
seven days a week.
And I was criticized for joking.

611
00:29:33,270 --> 00:29:34,103
Well,
you know about school because I've been 

612
00:29:35,251 --> 00:29:36,120
asked before.
Well,

613
00:29:36,121 --> 00:29:38,340
would you take any of those emails back?
Not on one of them,

614
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:39,713
because you know what,
that made a staffer smile that made 

615
00:29:41,531 --> 00:29:42,364
somebody laugh and if you don't 
understand the context within which it 

616
00:29:46,451 --> 00:29:49,720
was made,
then you are deliberately just trying to

617
00:29:49,721 --> 00:29:51,190
make hay out of something.

618
00:29:51,340 --> 00:29:52,173
All right,
so let's get back to that 10 seconds of 

619
00:29:53,891 --> 00:29:55,600
video.
Know the exact line.

620
00:29:55,601 --> 00:29:57,220
Even though everyone says it's a heck of
a job,

621
00:29:58,090 --> 00:30:00,130
they don't even get that right.
He actually said,

622
00:30:00,370 --> 00:30:02,260
Brownie,
you're doing a heck of A.

623
00:30:03,350 --> 00:30:04,183
Yeah,
I just want to clean that up for him 

624
00:30:04,920 --> 00:30:06,550
because even that line,
they don't get it.

625
00:30:06,560 --> 00:30:07,001
Right,
right.

626
00:30:07,001 --> 00:30:07,834
Okay.
How many days into the hurricane was 

627
00:30:10,151 --> 00:30:10,450
that?

628
00:30:10,450 --> 00:30:12,490
Oh Gosh.
I want to say it was maybe four,

629
00:30:12,491 --> 00:30:13,750
maybe five days.
I've kind of,

630
00:30:13,860 --> 00:30:15,730
I conflate time,
but four or five years.

631
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:17,140
Okay,
so four or five days.

632
00:30:17,141 --> 00:30:17,974
You know what?
Now I watched plenty of other video 

633
00:30:19,930 --> 00:30:23,890
today of what you were doing at the time
and you're standing there.

634
00:30:24,010 --> 00:30:27,040
People can see this on youtube.
You're standing there with giant maps of

635
00:30:27,041 --> 00:30:27,874
the whole area.
He was very clear to me at least 

636
00:30:29,500 --> 00:30:33,250
watching it now that you had total 
command of where things were and who was

637
00:30:33,251 --> 00:30:34,280
supposed to be,
where,

638
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:37,590
where water was going to hit harder.
And you know,

639
00:30:37,990 --> 00:30:38,910
Bush,
you know,

640
00:30:38,950 --> 00:30:39,783
to his credit,
he,

641
00:30:39,790 --> 00:30:43,360
it seemed that he was listening along 
with us and you know,

642
00:30:43,450 --> 00:30:45,070
doing the best job I think that he 
could,

643
00:30:46,120 --> 00:30:47,830
uh,
after.

644
00:30:48,130 --> 00:30:50,560
Was it a,
was it three minutes after he says that,

645
00:30:50,561 --> 00:30:53,110
that you realized there that the media 
went crazy with it?

646
00:30:53,130 --> 00:30:54,150
No,
it was the minute he was,

647
00:30:54,220 --> 00:30:57,790
the minute he said it because here's 
what you don't know what you,

648
00:30:57,850 --> 00:30:58,683
what most people don't know is that I 
had told the I called Air Force One and 

649
00:31:03,941 --> 00:31:04,774
said when he lands and gets here,
I need five minutes before we do any 

650
00:31:09,281 --> 00:31:14,281
sort of public photo op.
And when you,

651
00:31:15,610 --> 00:31:16,443
even at my level to the under secretary,
even when you say I gotTa have five 

652
00:31:19,061 --> 00:31:21,250
minutes with the president,
they still want to know why.

653
00:31:21,620 --> 00:31:24,670
And I said,
because he's got to understand before he

654
00:31:24,671 --> 00:31:25,504
walks in front of cameras,
how bad things are in New Orleans 

655
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:30,460
because we're gonna leave that Air 
National Guard base,

656
00:31:30,700 --> 00:31:31,533
get on marine one and we're going to fly
to New Orleans and he's going to start 

657
00:31:34,871 --> 00:31:35,704
seeing how screwed up it is in New 
Orleans and I want to make sure he 

658
00:31:39,521 --> 00:31:43,510
understands that before he gets there.
So sure.

659
00:31:43,511 --> 00:31:44,470
We got plenty of time.

660
00:31:44,530 --> 00:31:45,363
So we walk into the green room.
I'm just starting to talk to the 

661
00:31:48,341 --> 00:31:52,000
president and they come in and say we 
gotta get moving presses out here.

662
00:31:52,001 --> 00:31:52,834
We're already running late and they pull
him out and I don't have time to brief 

663
00:31:55,031 --> 00:31:57,190
him or how bad it is.
So the moment.

664
00:31:57,340 --> 00:31:59,260
And here's what really happened.
Bob Riley,

665
00:31:59,261 --> 00:32:01,270
who was the governor of Alabama,
former congressman,

666
00:32:01,570 --> 00:32:04,050
good friend of mine,
we were doing great male,

667
00:32:04,051 --> 00:32:06,130
a Bama thing for perfect and Alabama 
perfect.

668
00:32:06,131 --> 00:32:09,580
Things were very good in Mississippi.
It was just Louisiana.

669
00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:14,320
So Bob Riley being the supportive guy 
that he is said,

670
00:32:14,380 --> 00:32:14,831
oh,
by the way,

671
00:32:14,831 --> 00:32:16,680
Mr President,
I just want you to know that the team is

672
00:32:16,681 --> 00:32:20,170
doing a great job in Alabama.
And that's when the president said,

673
00:32:20,650 --> 00:32:22,210
boom,
slap me in the gut.

674
00:32:22,570 --> 00:32:24,010
And it was that moment,
Dave,

675
00:32:24,011 --> 00:32:25,780
that I knew.
Oh my God,

676
00:32:26,500 --> 00:32:27,333
now three things have happened.
The press knows that I've got a 

677
00:32:31,241 --> 00:32:33,760
relationship with the president that I 
have a nickname.

678
00:32:34,150 --> 00:32:37,420
So I'm one of the few people in the 
inner circle that has a nickname,

679
00:32:38,270 --> 00:32:39,470
uh,
to the press,

680
00:32:39,471 --> 00:32:44,471
knows how bad things are in New Orleans.
And now both me and the boss looked like

681
00:32:45,321 --> 00:32:48,590
we're totally out of touch about what's 
happening down in the Gulf.

682
00:32:49,460 --> 00:32:50,080
God,
I mean,

683
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:54,000
there's so much there when you really 
realize how this was happening,

684
00:32:54,310 --> 00:32:55,143
I was,

685
00:32:55,190 --> 00:32:59,900
if you watch that closely,
you'll see me grimace because I was just

686
00:32:59,901 --> 00:33:01,430
like,
holy.

687
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:03,073
Yeah.

688
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:05,160
So okay.
So once that happened,

689
00:33:05,220 --> 00:33:10,080
how much of what your job became was 
just dealing with media craziness,

690
00:33:10,190 --> 00:33:11,660
total,
total.

691
00:33:12,590 --> 00:33:13,423
Not just the media,
but now with a secretary of Homeland 

692
00:33:17,390 --> 00:33:18,740
Security,
Michael Chertoff,

693
00:33:19,130 --> 00:33:23,750
who have never done any sort of 
operations in his life.

694
00:33:23,751 --> 00:33:24,584
He was an appellate court judge and 
appellate court judge has clerks that 

695
00:33:27,411 --> 00:33:28,244
bring your briefs and say,
here's what we think your decisions 

696
00:33:29,561 --> 00:33:30,770
should be.
You sit behind the desk,

697
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:31,633
you take your time.
You don't realize that if you put off a 

698
00:33:33,681 --> 00:33:36,770
decision for 30 minutes in the middle of
a disaster,

699
00:33:37,040 --> 00:33:40,580
that translates to three hours and that 
costs lives.

700
00:33:40,730 --> 00:33:44,810
So now I'm dealing with a Boston DC that
doesn't have a clue what he's doing,

701
00:33:45,110 --> 00:33:50,110
who's mad at me because I'm on a Gulf 
stream trying to get from mobile to Gulf

702
00:33:50,331 --> 00:33:51,164
port to Baton Rouge,
to New Orleans and trying to keep my 

703
00:33:53,781 --> 00:33:56,510
fingers on everything going on.
Who tells me,

704
00:33:56,960 --> 00:33:59,460
I'm tired of you flying around because I
can't find you and I'm thinking,

705
00:33:59,461 --> 00:34:01,940
you can't find me.
I'm on a government.

706
00:34:01,941 --> 00:34:04,820
Gulf stream has got satellite.
You can find me anywhere in the world if

707
00:34:04,821 --> 00:34:05,654
you want to.
So tells me to plant my button in baton 

708
00:34:08,751 --> 00:34:11,240
rouge.
And I turned to my staff and say,

709
00:34:11,510 --> 00:34:13,510
this is the beginning of the end 
thereafter.

710
00:34:13,580 --> 00:34:15,290
Me,
the media is after me,

711
00:34:15,980 --> 00:34:18,380
Chertoff's after me.
They're looking for a scapegoat.

712
00:34:19,010 --> 00:34:20,930
I'm not that stupid.
I mean I know what's going on.

713
00:34:20,990 --> 00:34:22,020
Yeah.
Are.

714
00:34:22,150 --> 00:34:26,330
Are there any points of criticism during
that time that you think are.

715
00:34:26,650 --> 00:34:27,483
Yes,
yes,

716
00:34:27,630 --> 00:34:32,630
yes.
I have a friend who is a psychiatrist at

717
00:34:32,641 --> 00:34:36,450
the Kennedy School of government and the
school public health.

718
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:38,033
And I asked him one time,
I said there was a point during Katrina 

719
00:34:41,761 --> 00:34:45,270
where you haven't known me but a few 
minutes now,

720
00:34:45,271 --> 00:34:48,240
but I think you can tell I'm a pretty 
type a person person.

721
00:34:48,690 --> 00:34:51,270
Pretty energetic.
I'm pretty engaged in whatever I do.

722
00:34:51,271 --> 00:34:54,330
I'm passionate about what I do.
And I asked my buddy,

723
00:34:54,331 --> 00:34:59,070
I said,
so I know that there was a point where I

724
00:34:59,071 --> 00:34:59,904
was just frozen.
I literally could not make a decision 

725
00:35:03,750 --> 00:35:05,550
what?
What happens?

726
00:35:06,030 --> 00:35:08,780
He drew me a cartoon and it's a car,
you know,

727
00:35:09,260 --> 00:35:11,160
the great wizard of Oz.
Well,

728
00:35:11,161 --> 00:35:15,060
it's a picture of me in the first panel 
pushing all these buttons and levers and

729
00:35:15,120 --> 00:35:18,390
turning wheels and stuff.
And in the second panel,

730
00:35:18,391 --> 00:35:23,391
I'm staring at that same group of 
buttons like what's going on.

731
00:35:24,420 --> 00:35:25,253
And in the third panel I've gone around 
look behind and over wires have been 

732
00:35:28,641 --> 00:35:32,460
cut.
And he says that physiologically,

733
00:35:33,240 --> 00:35:34,440
whether it's,
it's a,

734
00:35:34,590 --> 00:35:35,423
it's ptsd,
it's a phenomena in the brain that when 

735
00:35:39,631 --> 00:35:41,370
we are trained,
like if I,

736
00:35:41,371 --> 00:35:45,120
if I have trained myself,
that when I tell my staff,

737
00:35:45,330 --> 00:35:47,850
do x,
I expect x to happen.

738
00:35:48,420 --> 00:35:51,330
When you and I turned on these lights or
flip a switch,

739
00:35:51,360 --> 00:35:56,360
we expect the lights to come on.
Now you add all the physical stress,

740
00:35:56,820 --> 00:35:59,970
the emotional stress and nothing is 
working.

741
00:36:00,270 --> 00:36:03,420
The brain starts to shut down and I will
freely admit.

742
00:36:03,860 --> 00:36:06,870
And this is why I,
I to this day,

743
00:36:06,871 --> 00:36:10,470
I saw a firefighter the other day on the
street was having lunch.

744
00:36:11,010 --> 00:36:12,930
And I walked up to him and I said,
what are you doing?

745
00:36:13,710 --> 00:36:15,510
We've been doing training and,
and uh,

746
00:36:15,690 --> 00:36:17,040
I'm taking the guys out for lunch.

747
00:36:17,430 --> 00:36:18,121
And I said,
well,

748
00:36:18,121 --> 00:36:20,370
you don't know who I am,
but let me just tell you that,

749
00:36:20,371 --> 00:36:21,330
uh,
you know,

750
00:36:21,331 --> 00:36:24,000
making sure those guys have time off and
that they get rest.

751
00:36:24,300 --> 00:36:25,133
That's the most important thing you can 
do because if they don't get rest when 

752
00:36:28,321 --> 00:36:29,154
they're fighting the fires,
they themselves can become victims of 

753
00:36:32,671 --> 00:36:36,300
that disaster.
So we've got to learn to train ourselves

754
00:36:36,600 --> 00:36:39,060
that when we're under that kind of 
stress,

755
00:36:39,330 --> 00:36:40,163
you have to be able to step back.
And this is what I speak about 

756
00:36:42,811 --> 00:36:43,644
resilience.
I've learned to try to teach audiences 

757
00:36:46,470 --> 00:36:47,303
that we all have a network and what we 
have to do is learn that when we find 

758
00:36:52,021 --> 00:36:56,190
ourselves in those moments that were 
either not making the right decisions or

759
00:36:56,191 --> 00:36:57,024
we're not making decisions,
we need some external force to come in 

760
00:37:00,540 --> 00:37:03,660
and kind of slapped some sense into us 
and say,

761
00:37:04,110 --> 00:37:05,220
change your perspective.

762
00:37:05,460 --> 00:37:10,260
What I see is this.
If somebody has helped me do that during

763
00:37:10,261 --> 00:37:11,094
Katrina,
might've still had the presidential bus 

764
00:37:13,681 --> 00:37:14,514
run me over,
but at least I would have known why and 

765
00:37:16,411 --> 00:37:17,244
what was happening.
But is that almost counter to the way a 

766
00:37:20,071 --> 00:37:23,240
sort of big government has to operate 
you course it is.

767
00:37:23,690 --> 00:37:26,130
You can't assume people are running 
around smacking people and trying to get

768
00:37:26,131 --> 00:37:28,440
him to wake up because the machine is so
stiff,

769
00:37:29,030 --> 00:37:31,220
but what?
I needed a and you could.

770
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:34,170
My very best friend and my lawyer,
Andy Lester,

771
00:37:34,260 --> 00:37:38,220
who went through all the congressional 
hearings with me to this day,

772
00:37:38,221 --> 00:37:39,054
he'll tell you that he regrets not 
getting in his car and driving to baton 

773
00:37:41,551 --> 00:37:42,384
rouge because he's watching this from a 
distance and he's seeing what's 

774
00:37:44,971 --> 00:37:47,430
happening and he knows me well enough 
that he.

775
00:37:47,550 --> 00:37:52,550
He could tell that I'm just frozen like 
nothing's working,

776
00:37:54,030 --> 00:37:55,080
what do I do next?

777
00:37:55,530 --> 00:37:58,260
And I just needed that external force to
come in and say,

778
00:37:58,500 --> 00:37:59,790
you're right,
nothing's working.

779
00:37:59,820 --> 00:38:01,860
Here's why.
Let's take inventory.

780
00:38:02,010 --> 00:38:03,570
Have you slept?
No,

781
00:38:03,571 --> 00:38:04,404
I haven't slept for three days.
Maybe you ought to go try to take an 

782
00:38:06,931 --> 00:38:08,670
ambien.
At least get four hours of sleep.

783
00:38:09,090 --> 00:38:11,490
It's that kind of stuff that makes a 
huge event at that point.

784
00:38:11,550 --> 00:38:13,440
Also with what was happening because of 
the media.

785
00:38:13,441 --> 00:38:14,274
You were sorta just in a feeding frenzy.
It was like a self fulfilling self 

786
00:38:18,090 --> 00:38:18,880
fulfilling,
right?

787
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:20,890
You know,
to this day I,

788
00:38:20,920 --> 00:38:22,710
I'm always amazed.
I mean I could,

789
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:24,600
I could go through the litany of false 
hoods,

790
00:38:24,940 --> 00:38:29,220
um,
that I no longer defensive about because

791
00:38:29,570 --> 00:38:30,403
they're false hoods and it is what it is
and I love talking about them in front 

792
00:38:33,901 --> 00:38:34,734
of,
you know,

793
00:38:34,810 --> 00:38:36,010
corporate ceos and

794
00:38:36,010 --> 00:38:38,620
Titans of industry who think they know 
that they can run everything.

795
00:38:38,770 --> 00:38:39,603
Well,
let me tell you,

796
00:38:39,640 --> 00:38:40,473
someday the preferred,
the proverbial theses is going to hit 

797
00:38:42,761 --> 00:38:45,910
the fan and your company and you're 
going to want to learn these lessons and

798
00:38:45,911 --> 00:38:46,540
learn them.
Well.

799
00:38:46,540 --> 00:38:51,540
That's why I run a small business here.
We have very little management.

800
00:38:51,770 --> 00:38:55,090
Very good.
What do you make of just sort of the.

801
00:38:55,150 --> 00:38:57,070
I guess this is just part of the human 
condition,

802
00:38:57,700 --> 00:39:00,670
the idea that we always need someone to 
blame.

803
00:39:00,700 --> 00:39:03,550
Now you are acknowledging that not 
everything went right.

804
00:39:03,660 --> 00:39:04,493
You didn't make every right decision.
We're acknowledging government over a 

805
00:39:07,420 --> 00:39:08,253
nonsense and all that,
but just this need to blame because I 

806
00:39:11,561 --> 00:39:14,670
think you are one of the first examples 
because maybe it was sort of at the,

807
00:39:14,680 --> 00:39:18,940
just at the beginnings of social media 
or lines of just like,

808
00:39:18,970 --> 00:39:21,400
let's just take this guy and we didn't 
know who he was.

809
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:24,120
Yes,
and less just destroy it.

810
00:39:24,130 --> 00:39:27,400
Let's just will destroy his career and 
then we'll try to destroy his life.

811
00:39:27,690 --> 00:39:28,523
What are you,
what do you make of just that general 

812
00:39:29,471 --> 00:39:30,790
psychological?
Well,

813
00:39:31,330 --> 00:39:32,440
there is a,
um,

814
00:39:32,710 --> 00:39:35,170
there's two ways to look at it.
In Judaism,

815
00:39:35,230 --> 00:39:36,063
there is the philosophy of finding the 
scape goat and putting all the sins of 

816
00:39:40,571 --> 00:39:41,404
the community,
putting all the sins of the village and 

817
00:39:42,490 --> 00:39:44,560
escape.
Let me go and throwing the gold over the

818
00:39:44,561 --> 00:39:45,790
cliff.
Well,

819
00:39:45,791 --> 00:39:46,624
I think that really is applicable to 
life in general and we have through 

820
00:39:49,721 --> 00:39:50,830
social media.
I can't,

821
00:39:50,860 --> 00:39:53,710
I can't even imagine what it would have 
been like with social media

822
00:39:54,010 --> 00:39:58,090
back in 2005.
It was brutal enough without it.

823
00:39:58,420 --> 00:39:59,253
But I think we have,
when you think about the hierarchy of 

824
00:40:03,131 --> 00:40:06,580
needs that people have belonged,
love,

825
00:40:06,670 --> 00:40:07,503
power,
social media has amplified all of those 

826
00:40:10,600 --> 00:40:11,433
and the,
the feeling of being superior to 

827
00:40:14,621 --> 00:40:15,454
somebody else so permeates our society 
that any chance we have to squish 

828
00:40:20,291 --> 00:40:21,730
somebody,
it makes.

829
00:40:21,940 --> 00:40:24,090
I don't know whether it's an endorphin 
rush,

830
00:40:24,110 --> 00:40:24,943
adrenaline,
but something that we now have this 

831
00:40:26,680 --> 00:40:30,130
horrible,
horrible desire to just destroy people.

832
00:40:30,700 --> 00:40:32,890
They have lives.
They have families now.

833
00:40:32,891 --> 00:40:35,290
Some people,
maybe they deserve it.

834
00:40:35,291 --> 00:40:36,800
Maybe they don't.
But I,

835
00:40:36,850 --> 00:40:41,140
I like to think that everybody,
unless you just totally a doofus,

836
00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:43,360
people are actually trying to do the 
best I can.

837
00:40:43,830 --> 00:40:45,630
Yeah.
I mean I'm a firm believer in that,

838
00:40:45,810 --> 00:40:46,643
but yes,
of course there are people that want to 

839
00:40:47,971 --> 00:40:49,890
just destroy.
Unfortunately,

840
00:40:49,891 --> 00:40:52,740
I think social media has amplified the 
best antidote

841
00:40:52,900 --> 00:40:57,900
that heals me because I refused to stay 
down.

842
00:40:58,550 --> 00:41:01,880
There were people have actually advised 
me you need to slither away.

843
00:41:02,300 --> 00:41:04,330
And I was like,
are you kidding me?

844
00:41:04,440 --> 00:41:05,273
I cannot wait for these congressional 
hearings because I can't wait for some 

845
00:41:09,080 --> 00:41:09,913
dumb ass congressman or dumb ass senator
who thinks that he's God's gift of 

846
00:41:12,731 --> 00:41:13,564
creation to ask me a question because 
I'm going to tell him the truth whether 

847
00:41:16,371 --> 00:41:17,110
he likes it or not.

848
00:41:17,110 --> 00:41:20,550
So let's talk about this hearing's a 
little bit when you see it.

849
00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:24,120
Just not hearing right.
Any hearing related to anything else.

850
00:41:24,520 --> 00:41:29,520
It strikes me as patently obvious that 
pretty much the senators and congressmen

851
00:41:30,101 --> 00:41:32,740
have almost no idea what they're talking
about really,

852
00:41:33,140 --> 00:41:36,620
but they've been handed a brief and 
they've been told by Prob,

853
00:41:36,640 --> 00:41:38,660
you know,
a handler or whoever.

854
00:41:38,780 --> 00:41:39,613
These are the three questions you got 
asked cause we gotta get you on CNN 

855
00:41:41,451 --> 00:41:43,360
tonight so then you can push this and 
blah blah.

856
00:41:44,200 --> 00:41:48,110
Just did the hearings when they're 
trying to unpackage all of this.

857
00:41:48,111 --> 00:41:51,260
Did hearings ever make things better at 
the end?

858
00:41:51,261 --> 00:41:53,390
Like is there a hearing that ends and 
then they go,

859
00:41:53,660 --> 00:41:57,110
we really solved the problems of,
of why Katrina happened,

860
00:41:57,111 --> 00:42:00,120
why the levees failed,
what the problems were with fema or were

861
00:42:00,121 --> 00:42:01,610
there other responders,
etc.

862
00:42:01,611 --> 00:42:02,570
Etc.
RarEly,

863
00:42:03,240 --> 00:42:03,991
in fact,
let me tell you,

864
00:42:03,991 --> 00:42:06,720
it's actually worse than what you think.
It's just more government growing.

865
00:42:07,100 --> 00:42:07,933
It's moRe government growing.
But to tell you how bad it really is 

866
00:42:11,300 --> 00:42:13,850
there.
If as the under secretary,

867
00:42:13,860 --> 00:42:16,930
if I'm going to testify now as a private
citizen when I testified in,

868
00:42:16,980 --> 00:42:18,270
in the katrina,
the hearings

869
00:42:18,890 --> 00:42:19,500
clear.
So how,

870
00:42:19,500 --> 00:42:24,500
how long after the John Brown eight 
until you until you resigned?

871
00:42:25,680 --> 00:42:26,041
Well,
I,

872
00:42:26,041 --> 00:42:27,780
I actually,
interestingly,

873
00:42:27,781 --> 00:42:32,781
I resigned on September 11th of 2005,
but then they came to me and said,

874
00:42:34,260 --> 00:42:35,093
oh we need you to stay on because we've 
got to figure out just what's going on 

875
00:42:39,751 --> 00:42:42,030
because they're going to come after the 
administration.

876
00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:43,313
So we went to cow,
we want to keep you in the fold for 

877
00:42:45,481 --> 00:42:46,314
awhile.
So they kept me on as a consultant for 

878
00:42:48,650 --> 00:42:49,483
all right,
I want to say four or five months 

879
00:42:50,551 --> 00:42:52,510
afterwards.
And then I pulled the.

880
00:42:52,511 --> 00:42:53,344
You must have been seriously pissed at 
that because now you knew you were just 

881
00:42:55,261 --> 00:42:57,570
saying yes.
So I pulled the trigger and said no more

882
00:42:57,571 --> 00:42:58,404
consulting.
I'm a private citizen and so when I'm 

883
00:43:00,541 --> 00:43:01,374
called to testify,
the white house has to do one of two 

884
00:43:03,691 --> 00:43:04,524
things.
They have to either accept that I'm 

885
00:43:05,761 --> 00:43:06,594
going to tell the truth or they have to 
invoke executive privilege and prevent 

886
00:43:09,541 --> 00:43:10,374
me from testifying and we deliberately 
settled up with Susan Collins and joe 

887
00:43:14,341 --> 00:43:18,060
lieberman for senator lieberman to ask 
me a question,

888
00:43:18,680 --> 00:43:19,513
so about conversations with the 
president or the white house so that 

889
00:43:23,790 --> 00:43:27,270
when that question was asked,
my lawyer could say,

890
00:43:28,290 --> 00:43:32,100
my client wants to answer the question,
but he cannot.

891
00:43:32,190 --> 00:43:35,100
If the white house is going to invoke 
executive privilege,

892
00:43:35,520 --> 00:43:39,000
which then allowed senator lieberman see
how the charade works,

893
00:43:39,390 --> 00:43:40,223
then allow senator lieberman to ask,
is there anyone in this hearing room 

894
00:43:43,770 --> 00:43:47,370
from the white house who wants to invoke
executive privilege?

895
00:43:47,850 --> 00:43:52,850
And of course the room silent and 
senator lieberman laughed and said,

896
00:43:54,150 --> 00:43:55,650
oh,
I'm sure there are plenty of people from

897
00:43:55,651 --> 00:43:56,484
the white house here,
but apparently nobody wants to invoke 

898
00:43:58,351 --> 00:44:00,210
executive privilege.
Mr.

899
00:44:00,210 --> 00:44:03,270
Brown answer the questIon and boom,
we were off to the races,

900
00:44:03,750 --> 00:44:05,550
but to go back about just a regular 
hearing.

901
00:44:05,610 --> 00:44:06,443
Yeah.
If an under secretary or any other 

902
00:44:08,281 --> 00:44:10,320
government official is going to go 
testify,

903
00:44:10,590 --> 00:44:13,920
his testimony is cleared through the 
office of management and budget.

904
00:44:14,460 --> 00:44:19,170
That testimony is given to the senators 
and congressmen in advance.

905
00:44:19,620 --> 00:44:22,530
The questions are given to the witness 
in advance.

906
00:44:22,830 --> 00:44:25,140
It is a show.
It is a production.

907
00:44:26,050 --> 00:44:26,883
How much of it also is that they're 
asking you things as if everything sort 

908
00:44:30,401 --> 00:44:32,850
of works perfectly in any of the 
hearings.

909
00:44:32,851 --> 00:44:33,684
You know when hillary,
the benghazi hearings where they're 

910
00:44:35,431 --> 00:44:38,160
asking minute by minute,
what did you say then to this person,

911
00:44:38,161 --> 00:44:39,070
that person.
I mean,

912
00:44:39,080 --> 00:44:42,990
I know in my own daily life you asked me
what happened three days ago at noon,

913
00:44:42,991 --> 00:44:43,550
right?

914
00:44:43,550 --> 00:44:44,383
You know,

915
00:44:45,380 --> 00:44:47,050
I'd have to think about it for awhile,
but may I?

916
00:44:47,051 --> 00:44:50,250
Maybe I can come up with it,
but just that they.

917
00:44:50,330 --> 00:44:52,030
They're trying to get you on every 
little thing.

918
00:44:52,031 --> 00:44:54,460
Plus the pressures of your.
You're under oath,

919
00:44:54,500 --> 00:44:56,320
you're the media watching and everything
else.

920
00:44:56,600 --> 00:44:58,600
It just seems like it's a recipe

921
00:44:59,280 --> 00:45:01,080
for nothing.
Nothing good,

922
00:45:01,081 --> 00:45:01,914
nothing substantial to come out.
Nothing substantial does come out of 

923
00:45:03,871 --> 00:45:04,704
them now.
I think there's an exception if if in 

924
00:45:07,351 --> 00:45:08,184
the house or senate,
if they are truly conducting and 

925
00:45:09,781 --> 00:45:10,614
investigation,
and here's how to tell if they're truly 

926
00:45:12,631 --> 00:45:13,464
conducting your investigation,
they'll depose witnesses outside the 

927
00:45:17,461 --> 00:45:18,294
hearing room.
They will ask a witness either 

928
00:45:20,251 --> 00:45:21,084
voluntarily or with a subpoena to come 
in and subject to a deposition by staff 

929
00:45:25,860 --> 00:45:26,693
lawyers.
That's a real investigation that's 

930
00:45:28,771 --> 00:45:31,680
really sitting you down and saying,
swear to tell the truth,

931
00:45:31,681 --> 00:45:33,000
the whole truth,
nothing but the truth.

932
00:45:33,300 --> 00:45:36,420
Now,
let us ask you a serIes of questions and

933
00:45:37,590 --> 00:45:40,290
that can actually result in something 
productive.

934
00:45:40,650 --> 00:45:41,483
Now for the witness,
do you have to be very careful because 

935
00:45:43,020 --> 00:45:46,680
like anything else to your point,
why don't you do on wednesday at noon?

936
00:45:47,340 --> 00:45:48,840
Um,
I,

937
00:45:48,990 --> 00:45:50,420
you know,
I went to uh,

938
00:45:50,630 --> 00:45:52,980
went to this bagel shop down the street 
and have lunch.

939
00:45:53,520 --> 00:45:54,480
What was the name of it?
Well,

940
00:45:54,481 --> 00:45:55,314
I think it was x.
They find out actually you went to a 

941
00:45:58,231 --> 00:46:01,080
burger stand and had a burger.
Now they got you in perjury.

942
00:46:01,260 --> 00:46:02,460
Yeah,
it's crazy.

943
00:46:03,210 --> 00:46:06,560
It really is crazy.
So what was the resolution and when the,

944
00:46:06,561 --> 00:46:08,440
when the hearings ended,
like what,

945
00:46:08,540 --> 00:46:10,950
what do they do?
So then they issue a report that report,

946
00:46:11,010 --> 00:46:15,060
is there a prior brand and the report,
the report,

947
00:46:15,330 --> 00:46:20,010
I get a kick out of this because the 
report virtually acknowledged everything

948
00:46:20,011 --> 00:46:20,844
that I had said was wrong about the 
integration of fema and these other 

949
00:46:25,261 --> 00:46:26,094
agencies in the dhs.
There was a virtual admission to that 

950
00:46:29,550 --> 00:46:32,440
then the things that they wanted to do 
to correct.

951
00:46:32,441 --> 00:46:33,330
Uh,
we're,

952
00:46:34,260 --> 00:46:36,780
I don't want to over exaggerate.
So let's just say 50 percent.

953
00:46:37,410 --> 00:46:40,830
The nss dropped about 50 percent of the 
things that I've been arguing about.

954
00:46:41,190 --> 00:46:43,140
Now,
is it working?

955
00:46:43,590 --> 00:46:46,440
It's not working Because the way things 
go in dc,

956
00:46:46,800 --> 00:46:50,660
whoever has the money has the power and 
you can't wander.

957
00:46:50,730 --> 00:46:53,700
I'm using the theme of current fema 
director who's a former employee of mine

958
00:46:53,701 --> 00:46:57,900
as an example.
you can't expect him on a day to day.

959
00:46:58,020 --> 00:46:59,910
what's his name?
brock brock long.

960
00:46:59,960 --> 00:47:02,100
Okay.
Used to be the at the national hurricane

961
00:47:02,101 --> 00:47:04,080
center.
emergency manager in Alabama.

962
00:47:04,320 --> 00:47:05,880
He's a great guy.
I love this guy.

963
00:47:06,480 --> 00:47:07,313
Uh,
probably shouldn't have said that 

964
00:47:08,251 --> 00:47:09,084
because that will know.

965
00:47:09,240 --> 00:47:14,240
Plus they'll regret having said that,
let's edit that out.

966
00:47:15,630 --> 00:47:19,240
We donate It for you probably made his 
Kenya everybody,

967
00:47:19,540 --> 00:47:20,560
right,
exactly.

968
00:47:21,690 --> 00:47:22,450
So we're,
we're,

969
00:47:22,450 --> 00:47:24,580
we're,
uh,

970
00:47:24,880 --> 00:47:29,160
well the reports and the report.
So if,

971
00:47:29,790 --> 00:47:30,623
if you're fighting on a day to day basis
for your budget with the secretary of 

972
00:47:33,971 --> 00:47:36,220
homeland security and all the other 
under secretaries,

973
00:47:36,730 --> 00:47:41,230
and then when a disaster hits,
now you're the boss and the secretary is

974
00:47:41,231 --> 00:47:42,064
subordinate to you.
Can you imagine knowing that in the 

975
00:47:44,131 --> 00:47:44,964
private sector one day you're the ceo,
but under certain circumstances you as 

976
00:47:49,331 --> 00:47:52,390
the ceo or actually subordinate to 
somebody else on your staff.

977
00:47:52,660 --> 00:47:53,493
I mean that's an untenable situation,
but that's kind of the situation they 

978
00:47:55,311 --> 00:47:58,000
created with the post katrina act.
That's crazy.

979
00:47:58,250 --> 00:47:59,083
So we,
we touched obviously on the media 

980
00:48:00,081 --> 00:48:00,914
portion of this and I mentioned how when
I was googling you this morning as I'm 

981
00:48:03,051 --> 00:48:03,884
doing research,
half the articles come up are about the 

982
00:48:05,541 --> 00:48:08,210
10 year anniversary and they're still 
attacking.

983
00:48:08,240 --> 00:48:09,380
Yes.
Yeah.

984
00:48:09,381 --> 00:48:10,214
Again,
you have sat here and acknowledge that 

985
00:48:11,721 --> 00:48:13,480
you did not do everything perfectly.
Right?

986
00:48:13,730 --> 00:48:16,040
But what does,
what do you make of that in a more broad

987
00:48:16,041 --> 00:48:16,874
sense about the media?
Because I talk about the media a lot 

988
00:48:18,501 --> 00:48:19,334
here and I'm extremely frustrated with 
mainstream media and it's almost gotten 

989
00:48:21,951 --> 00:48:24,170
to the point where every time they write
something bad about somebody,

990
00:48:24,171 --> 00:48:25,004
I started thinking that they're actually
the good guy because I see the way they 

991
00:48:26,971 --> 00:48:31,971
do it to me that the neo really has 
completely gotten out of control.

992
00:48:32,060 --> 00:48:33,020
They've.
They've lost,

993
00:48:33,100 --> 00:48:36,110
they've lost all integrity,
they've lost all.

994
00:48:36,150 --> 00:48:36,983
I'm just,
this is what I do on my own radio 

995
00:48:38,391 --> 00:48:39,224
program is I don't tell.
I don't ever try to tell people what to 

996
00:48:42,231 --> 00:48:43,064
think.
I try to give them a different 

997
00:48:44,061 --> 00:48:48,110
perspective so that they can,
with their own minds.

998
00:48:48,470 --> 00:48:50,660
Maybe think about something a different 
way.

999
00:48:51,150 --> 00:48:51,983
The media,
if you look for those 10 year 

1000
00:48:53,691 --> 00:48:54,524
anniversary things or there's a one 
example that just stands out to this 

1001
00:48:57,201 --> 00:48:58,034
date irritates me.
I had the highest level of security 

1002
00:49:02,091 --> 00:49:02,924
clearances with the cia.
The nsa had a q clearance with the 

1003
00:49:05,331 --> 00:49:06,164
department of energy,
which means I had access to all the 

1004
00:49:08,040 --> 00:49:09,320
secrets and everything else.
I mean,

1005
00:49:09,321 --> 00:49:13,550
I,
I top secret special access programs.

1006
00:49:13,610 --> 00:49:14,290
That was me.

1007
00:49:14,290 --> 00:49:15,123
I don't know if you're going to drop any
other secret knowledge while you're 

1008
00:49:16,321 --> 00:49:16,470
right,

1009
00:49:16,470 --> 00:49:17,303
if you're right.
So I had all these clearances and 

1010
00:49:18,651 --> 00:49:19,484
everything else.
Time magazine ran a story that I had 

1011
00:49:22,881 --> 00:49:27,770
lied on my resume.
Now my first reaction when they ran that

1012
00:49:27,771 --> 00:49:28,604
story was sued the bastards.
I want to go after him and then my 

1013
00:49:31,521 --> 00:49:33,500
lawyer starts explaining to me,
okay,

1014
00:49:33,830 --> 00:49:35,030
um,
first of all,

1015
00:49:35,031 --> 00:49:35,864
you're going to have to prove they did 
it with willful malice because you're a 

1016
00:49:37,431 --> 00:49:38,264
public figure.
Then you're going to have to go through 

1017
00:49:40,401 --> 00:49:41,234
all of the strain and time and energy of
depositions in a trial and hearings and 

1018
00:49:46,580 --> 00:49:47,413
you want to relive all of that.
Or do you really care about time 

1019
00:49:49,551 --> 00:49:52,160
magazine having some story that's now 
10,

1020
00:49:52,161 --> 00:49:52,994
12,
15 years old about you lied on your 

1021
00:49:53,841 --> 00:49:57,860
resume when you Know what the truth is.
And half of America knows what the truth

1022
00:49:57,861 --> 00:50:00,710
is and the other half of America you 
don't really care about.

1023
00:50:00,740 --> 00:50:01,910
Yeah,
no,

1024
00:50:02,780 --> 00:50:06,710
but the media gets by with now I am not.
I am not.

1025
00:50:06,740 --> 00:50:09,710
Repeat.
Not going down the road,

1026
00:50:09,711 --> 00:50:12,620
the trump goes down that says we need to
change the libel laws.

1027
00:50:12,950 --> 00:50:17,950
I'm just pointing out that the media has
this amazing power and with that power I

1028
00:50:18,801 --> 00:50:22,310
believe countries possibility and 
they've abdicated the responsibility.

1029
00:50:22,550 --> 00:50:24,950
Yeah.
You don't 50 Slash 50 on the libel thing

1030
00:50:24,951 --> 00:50:28,250
and everyone that's watching the show 
that I am an free speech.

1031
00:50:28,251 --> 00:50:31,080
Absolute statute is an absolute twice 
there,

1032
00:50:31,310 --> 00:50:32,143
but I do believe in libel laws and I do 
believe we should have laws to protect 

1033
00:50:35,451 --> 00:50:38,150
privacy and a series of other things.
I don't know.

1034
00:50:38,270 --> 00:50:39,103
I would prefer that they don't be 
changed because I don't think we need 

1035
00:50:40,971 --> 00:50:43,630
the government doing anything.
I don't think we need more laws.

1036
00:50:43,640 --> 00:50:45,450
I don't think we need more regulations 
or any of that.

1037
00:50:45,820 --> 00:50:46,653
Right.
There is something that I see so 

1038
00:50:48,021 --> 00:50:52,490
consistently these days where they Just 
pick somebody and it's awful.

1039
00:50:52,491 --> 00:50:53,324
I mean,
it's often people that I have on this 

1040
00:50:54,111 --> 00:50:54,944
show Because they're right in the thick 
of have important conversations and we 

1041
00:50:57,801 --> 00:50:58,634
say one thing here and then I read the 
article about it the day after and it's 

1042
00:51:01,671 --> 00:51:04,420
literally the reverse or they cut the 
word not right,

1043
00:51:04,730 --> 00:51:05,860
you know,
or didn't.

1044
00:51:06,240 --> 00:51:07,073
it's

1045
00:51:07,490 --> 00:51:08,323
what I have found that I find 
fascinating and I know that media is in 

1046
00:51:11,091 --> 00:51:11,924
this transition.
You let me look at what you and I are 

1047
00:51:13,281 --> 00:51:15,410
doing.
They hate what you and I are doing right

1048
00:51:15,411 --> 00:51:18,920
now because it throws away our business 
model out the window.

1049
00:51:18,970 --> 00:51:21,950
Yeah.
I think what the.

1050
00:51:22,270 --> 00:51:24,350
Like I'll.
I'll be doing a story on,

1051
00:51:24,400 --> 00:51:28,020
on air and I've got the article in front
of me and I'm a.

1052
00:51:28,040 --> 00:51:30,280
I'm a kind of a grammar nut and I'll 
look at.

1053
00:51:30,290 --> 00:51:31,340
I'll go,
holy crap.

1054
00:51:31,910 --> 00:51:35,360
An editor never even looked at this.
The wall street journal.

1055
00:51:36,090 --> 00:51:38,960
You the stellar newspaper,
right?

1056
00:51:39,020 --> 00:51:40,240
Yeah,
I'd have.

1057
00:51:40,280 --> 00:51:43,610
They fired all their editors.
I find so many grammatical errors,

1058
00:51:43,611 --> 00:51:44,780
punctuation errors,
all.

1059
00:51:44,960 --> 00:51:49,960
I just think the media is in this flux,
so you add the flux With their agenda at

1060
00:51:54,801 --> 00:51:58,640
times their sloppiness.
You had all of those things together.

1061
00:51:58,880 --> 00:52:03,170
The media is just not filling their 
fourth estate responsibilities.

1062
00:52:03,300 --> 00:52:04,133
Yeah.
So how do we clean up some of this 

1063
00:52:05,371 --> 00:52:07,080
government stuff?
I suspect,

1064
00:52:07,081 --> 00:52:09,180
although you just saId you're not with 
trump on the,

1065
00:52:09,181 --> 00:52:09,830
uh,
alIve,

1066
00:52:09,830 --> 00:52:10,663
but I suspect that there's a certain 
amount of deregulation that he's doing 

1067
00:52:14,851 --> 00:52:17,580
and cutting back some of these agencies 
that you got to be pretty happy with

1068
00:52:18,840 --> 00:52:22,710
static about it.
When you think about this whole,

1069
00:52:24,090 --> 00:52:27,840
you'll find it so bizarre example,
but whether it's here in California,

1070
00:52:27,841 --> 00:52:29,040
back in Colorado,
wherever,

1071
00:52:29,070 --> 00:52:33,630
wherever we might might be.
I challenge people watching this go look

1072
00:52:33,631 --> 00:52:34,464
at any government office and I would bet
it's the nicest office building in your 

1073
00:52:39,301 --> 00:52:40,570
community.
Now,

1074
00:52:40,590 --> 00:52:42,060
wait a minute.
Who paid for that?

1075
00:52:42,990 --> 00:52:46,740
The guys in the garage who were coming 
up with the next big thing,

1076
00:52:47,370 --> 00:52:52,140
assam startup company or some guidance 
working an eight to five blue collar job

1077
00:52:52,141 --> 00:52:52,974
that got his hands dirty and his nails 
are cracked and he's working with his 

1078
00:52:55,411 --> 00:52:58,430
hands like crazy.
They're paying for that is,

1079
00:52:58,440 --> 00:52:59,273
It shouldn't be the reverse fact.
Shouldn't the government actually be in 

1080
00:53:01,771 --> 00:53:02,900
the garages?
Shouldn't they?

1081
00:53:02,901 --> 00:53:05,880
Actually be the ones that are in the 
office buildings that you know,

1082
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:06,833
they have to go up 20 elevatorS to get 
to their offices instead of having all 

1083
00:53:09,571 --> 00:53:13,470
the edifices that we allow them to use 
and create and build.

1084
00:53:13,680 --> 00:53:14,513
We have this,
we have this perverted sense that the 

1085
00:53:17,400 --> 00:53:19,080
government,
and I think it's getting worse,

1086
00:53:19,350 --> 00:53:20,183
that the government is the answer to 
everything and that somehow government 

1087
00:53:22,841 --> 00:53:23,674
is going to solve all of our problems.
Let tell you the government doesn't 

1088
00:53:27,301 --> 00:53:30,180
solve problems.
The government causes problems.

1089
00:53:31,710 --> 00:53:33,660
So what would you say the answer is 
related to?

1090
00:53:33,661 --> 00:53:38,400
So at dhs or fema now or anything else?
I mean if these things didn't exist,

1091
00:53:38,401 --> 00:53:39,870
I'm sure somebody is watching this right
now.

1092
00:53:40,550 --> 00:53:42,360
What do you mean?
I mean if these things didn't exist,

1093
00:53:42,600 --> 00:53:45,900
well now you know new orleans still is 
below sea level,

1094
00:53:45,901 --> 00:53:46,734
which is a whole in that.
That was just talking about that for a 

1095
00:53:48,811 --> 00:53:49,644
second.
There are a certain amount of people 

1096
00:53:50,671 --> 00:53:51,720
that now say,
well,

1097
00:53:51,721 --> 00:53:52,554
wait a minute,
wait a minute.

1098
00:53:52,740 --> 00:53:54,360
Because they don't realize it.
Then they hear it and they go,

1099
00:53:54,361 --> 00:53:55,194
wait a minute.
We have a city that's below sea level 

1100
00:53:56,701 --> 00:53:59,400
that has all of these structural 
problems.

1101
00:53:59,940 --> 00:54:01,560
Maybe we shouldn't be living there 
anymore.

1102
00:54:01,840 --> 00:54:04,230
What do you say to someone like that?
First of all,

1103
00:54:04,231 --> 00:54:06,300
I think anybody should be able to live 
wherever they want to live.

1104
00:54:06,500 --> 00:54:07,333
If if,
if I want to live next to the national 

1105
00:54:09,061 --> 00:54:11,250
forest in boulder county,
Colorado,

1106
00:54:11,430 --> 00:54:12,263
I should be able to do that,
but then I should also assume the risk 

1107
00:54:14,580 --> 00:54:15,413
of living there.
If I want to live on the fault lines in 

1108
00:54:18,301 --> 00:54:20,490
California,
I should be able to do that,

1109
00:54:20,640 --> 00:54:22,130
but I should assume the risk.
Yeah,

1110
00:54:22,140 --> 00:54:24,930
I think government has some basic 
services to provide.

1111
00:54:24,931 --> 00:54:27,420
We all agree the police protection,
fire protection,

1112
00:54:27,421 --> 00:54:28,254
that's something we all want to pay for,
but if you're going to deliberately 

1113
00:54:32,311 --> 00:54:37,311
choose to live below sea level and then 
why should I want to be very careful.

1114
00:54:40,660 --> 00:54:42,510
I can feel it already.
Why it's slippery.

1115
00:54:42,760 --> 00:54:46,800
It's slippery because I think they 
should be able to live there.

1116
00:54:47,190 --> 00:54:51,750
If you choose to live there though,
it's the responsibility of the taxpayers

1117
00:54:51,930 --> 00:54:52,763
that lived there to create those levies 
and build those levies and maintain 

1118
00:54:56,221 --> 00:54:58,620
those levees.
Because I don't live there.

1119
00:54:59,070 --> 00:54:59,903
It's not my responsibility.
I pay taxes to take care of the hazard 

1120
00:55:03,451 --> 00:55:04,284
where I live and frankly I don't think 
the government should take care of all 

1121
00:55:06,781 --> 00:55:07,614
hazards because if we tried to start,
if we start trying to protect the 

1122
00:55:11,821 --> 00:55:15,270
american population from all of the 
hazards that we face,

1123
00:55:15,540 --> 00:55:16,373
we will end up with a totalitarian 
government because there's too many 

1124
00:55:20,191 --> 00:55:21,024
hazards.
So this is sort of the case where the 

1125
00:55:23,251 --> 00:55:26,190
people that that were down there in new 
orleans,

1126
00:55:26,310 --> 00:55:27,570
that ally,
it's not just.

1127
00:55:27,650 --> 00:55:29,760
I'm sure most of them had earned.
I can't say most,

1128
00:55:29,761 --> 00:55:32,130
but I'm sure a good portion,
at least in the people that had money,

1129
00:55:32,250 --> 00:55:34,680
had insurance and probably had flood 
insurance and everything else,

1130
00:55:35,100 --> 00:55:35,933
but it's that afterwards,
all this federal money comes in to help 

1131
00:55:38,551 --> 00:55:39,180
the rebuild.

1132
00:55:39,180 --> 00:55:43,380
But you're saying there perhaps that 
that doesn't quite make sense.

1133
00:55:43,381 --> 00:55:44,214
Is that,
is that basically there will be people 

1134
00:55:46,921 --> 00:55:48,000
who will say,
oh my god,

1135
00:55:48,001 --> 00:55:48,834
the former director of federal emergency
management agency is saying we should 

1136
00:55:52,171 --> 00:55:54,270
revisit.
Absolutely.

1137
00:55:54,330 --> 00:55:56,640
We have a concept of federalism in this 
country.

1138
00:55:56,641 --> 00:56:00,180
We have federal,
state and local government and at at the

1139
00:56:00,181 --> 00:56:01,650
top load,
let's reverse that.

1140
00:56:01,800 --> 00:56:03,840
We have the people,
we have local government,

1141
00:56:03,841 --> 00:56:04,674
state government and federal government.
That's the order and what we have done 

1142
00:56:08,400 --> 00:56:09,233
is we've taken the federal government 
and we've almost made them the local 

1143
00:56:13,111 --> 00:56:13,944
fire department.
We've almost made them the local police 

1144
00:56:15,631 --> 00:56:17,490
department and the many aspects.
That's actually true.

1145
00:56:17,520 --> 00:56:18,353
Tsa for example,
we've made them a local police 

1146
00:56:19,921 --> 00:56:22,980
department.
Even though I want to be a lawyer here,

1147
00:56:23,170 --> 00:56:25,780
they have no law enforcement authority.
They just think they do,

1148
00:56:26,050 --> 00:56:28,360
but they have zero law enforcement 
authority.

1149
00:56:29,050 --> 00:56:29,883
What does it actually mean?
They have zero law enforcement 

1150
00:56:31,511 --> 00:56:32,470
authority.
I mean if they.

1151
00:56:32,650 --> 00:56:35,930
If you go through and you've got a knife
in your pocket like,

1152
00:56:35,950 --> 00:56:36,783
oh,
then they just hand you off to whoever 

1153
00:56:37,601 --> 00:56:39,570
the local daniel,
you got to get a cup.

1154
00:56:39,730 --> 00:56:40,830
I think I'd get a cop.
They can.

1155
00:56:40,870 --> 00:56:42,190
They can arrest you,
they cannot detain you,

1156
00:56:42,191 --> 00:56:43,024
they can't do anything,
but they call themselves officers 

1157
00:56:44,831 --> 00:56:45,664
because they wouldn't put on the mask of
authority because government always 

1158
00:56:47,951 --> 00:56:51,700
wants to put on the mask of authority 
because that's how you keep the citizens

1159
00:56:52,980 --> 00:56:54,040
kind of subdued.
No.

1160
00:56:54,340 --> 00:56:55,173
Well,
my whole point about female becoming 

1161
00:56:57,401 --> 00:56:58,234
kind of this first responder,
the more we rely on the federal 

1162
00:57:00,701 --> 00:57:01,534
government to come in after any sort of 
disaster that weakened state and local 

1163
00:57:05,681 --> 00:57:06,514
governments because they become more and
more dependent upon the federal 

1164
00:57:08,381 --> 00:57:11,110
government.
So more and more things get nationalized

1165
00:57:11,260 --> 00:57:15,970
and the more things get nationalized,
the more we turn into a western european

1166
00:57:15,971 --> 00:57:16,804
socialist type government,
which we know it's not going to happen 

1167
00:57:19,211 --> 00:57:19,960
in our lifetimes.

1168
00:57:19,960 --> 00:57:20,793
Don't get me wrong,
I'm not.

1169
00:57:20,820 --> 00:57:22,420
I'm the tinfoil hatS.
Not on,

1170
00:57:22,770 --> 00:57:23,603
but,
but I do believe that republics 

1171
00:57:26,140 --> 00:57:26,973
eventually fail and we are on this path 
that if we keep going down this path of 

1172
00:57:31,661 --> 00:57:35,110
throwing more and more things up against
the wall for the federal government to,

1173
00:57:35,270 --> 00:57:36,103
to handle and take care of,
we will end up as a western european 

1174
00:57:39,641 --> 00:57:40,474
socialist government and over 
generations and generations that leads 

1175
00:57:43,751 --> 00:57:44,584
to tyranny.
So then you must be digging trump on 

1176
00:57:48,701 --> 00:57:49,570
this.
Oh,

1177
00:57:49,571 --> 00:57:50,710
and this stuff.
Absolutely.

1178
00:57:50,711 --> 00:57:51,460
Yeah.
The thing,

1179
00:57:51,460 --> 00:57:53,270
the thing that bothers me,
look,

1180
00:57:53,850 --> 00:57:56,290
the president wasn't my first choice and
I,

1181
00:57:56,380 --> 00:57:59,350
before we go too deep and I do want to 
mention that we are taping this a little

1182
00:57:59,351 --> 00:58:00,700
bit in advance of when it's going to 
air.

1183
00:58:00,701 --> 00:58:04,840
So I just want to be very,
very clear.

1184
00:58:04,841 --> 00:58:08,310
But who knows what happened to the guys.

1185
00:58:08,620 --> 00:58:10,180
Um,
it wasn't my first choice,

1186
00:58:10,181 --> 00:58:11,014
but when it came down to the,
to the typical dichotomy of republican 

1187
00:58:13,811 --> 00:58:15,780
versus democrat have,
you know,

1188
00:58:15,820 --> 00:58:16,653
I still think I still want to believe 
that republicans or the government of 

1189
00:58:20,261 --> 00:58:22,510
individualism and individual liberty and
everything,

1190
00:58:22,511 --> 00:58:23,344
although I could argue that they aren't 
necessarily that way and the democrats 

1191
00:58:26,660 --> 00:58:30,190
are moving to the hard progressive,
almost marxist left.

1192
00:58:30,550 --> 00:58:32,380
So when it comes to the general 
election,

1193
00:58:32,770 --> 00:58:35,620
if I want to vote for one of those two,
I'm going to vote for trump.

1194
00:58:36,250 --> 00:58:41,250
I only say that because he has totally 
up into what it means.

1195
00:58:45,310 --> 00:58:49,180
I work for george w dot buSh who people 
thought couldn't speak well.

1196
00:58:49,360 --> 00:58:52,560
Um,
but I thought was smart,

1197
00:58:53,020 --> 00:58:54,650
knew what he was doing.
A,

1198
00:58:54,700 --> 00:58:57,190
I think trump is smart.
I think he knows what he's doing,

1199
00:58:57,490 --> 00:58:58,323
but he's the first president in this age
of twitter and facebook and everything 

1200
00:59:02,201 --> 00:59:03,034
else.
And I just don't think we've quite 

1201
00:59:03,371 --> 00:59:07,030
figured out how to deal with that.
And quite honestly,

1202
00:59:07,031 --> 00:59:09,130
I don't think he's quite figured out how
to deal with it.

1203
00:59:09,640 --> 00:59:12,610
He hasn't quite figured out that as 
president,

1204
00:59:12,670 --> 00:59:17,320
if I say something even innocuous,
they're reading,

1205
00:59:18,230 --> 00:59:22,790
they're reading that in moscow,
they're reading that in pyongyang there,

1206
00:59:22,791 --> 00:59:25,730
reading it everywhere and so he needs to
be a little more.

1207
00:59:25,790 --> 00:59:29,450
I just wish it would be a little more 
circumspect with use of social media.

1208
00:59:29,540 --> 00:59:30,110
Yeah,

1209
00:59:30,110 --> 00:59:31,330
right.
I know enough about trump.

1210
00:59:31,340 --> 00:59:32,810
Let.
Let's just talk about George W.

1211
00:59:32,810 --> 00:59:34,040
Bush for a second because you mentioned 
he was.

1212
00:59:34,070 --> 00:59:34,960
He was your boss,
you know.

1213
00:59:35,010 --> 00:59:35,691
Well,
you know,

1214
00:59:35,691 --> 00:59:36,524
there was the caricature of course,
of all the years of his presidency that 

1215
00:59:38,511 --> 00:59:40,490
he was some sort of idiot or you know.
Yes.

1216
00:59:40,491 --> 00:59:41,324
He had a strange way of speaking and 
kind of stilted and met a lot of that 

1217
00:59:46,641 --> 00:59:50,080
writing mixed up a lot of words.
Wow.

1218
00:59:50,420 --> 00:59:51,253
Tell me something about him that maybe 
would give us a little other side that 

1219
00:59:53,871 --> 00:59:56,040
we would know.
Sure.

1220
00:59:56,060 --> 00:59:57,920
There's an odd nostalgia.
That's what I'm saying.

1221
00:59:58,180 --> 01:00:01,180
There's an odd nostalgia about him now 
because I see it from people on the left

1222
01:00:01,181 --> 01:00:01,931
all the time.
Now they're,

1223
01:00:01,931 --> 01:00:04,360
they're sort of galvanIzing him right 
there.

1224
01:00:04,380 --> 01:00:06,000
There are lionizing him now.

1225
01:00:06,350 --> 01:00:09,840
He,
he and I were in the limo,

1226
01:00:09,870 --> 01:00:12,090
we were in the beast,
southern California,

1227
01:00:12,570 --> 01:00:13,403
going back to a marine one,
and we're on these kind of rural areas 

1228
01:00:18,420 --> 01:00:21,810
and people have lined the streets and 
eddie,

1229
01:00:21,811 --> 01:00:25,320
who was his agent in charge of 
presidential detail,

1230
01:00:25,950 --> 01:00:26,783
he kept telling eddie,
and I wouldn't use these words 

1231
01:00:28,291 --> 01:00:31,200
carefully,
eddie stop the car.

1232
01:00:31,710 --> 01:00:34,260
These people want to see their 
president.

1233
01:00:35,220 --> 01:00:36,053
It wasn't eddie stopped the car.
They want to see me and he don't stop 

1234
01:00:38,551 --> 01:00:40,170
the car because they want to see,
you know,

1235
01:00:40,230 --> 01:00:41,210
hey,
it's me and brown.

1236
01:00:41,340 --> 01:00:43,650
No,
they want to see their president.

1237
01:00:44,400 --> 01:00:45,233
He had this understanding of that office
was his temporarily and he was 

1238
01:00:50,940 --> 01:00:51,773
everybody's president and I saw that in 
that car and then I saw at one time in 

1239
01:00:56,461 --> 01:01:01,461
the oval office we were sitting in and 
press office comes through with a gaggle

1240
01:01:01,861 --> 01:01:06,861
of kids and he stops the meeting 
entirely and shows these kids.

1241
01:01:07,860 --> 01:01:09,990
I mean they missed maybe sixth grade or 
seventh graders.

1242
01:01:10,320 --> 01:01:11,153
Shows them the resolute desk and 
explains to them the history of the 

1243
01:01:13,411 --> 01:01:16,620
resolute desk and I'm sitting there 
like,

1244
01:01:16,900 --> 01:01:20,310
oh,
I can watch this all day long.

1245
01:01:20,460 --> 01:01:23,090
Yeah.
Then a third story we.

1246
01:01:23,980 --> 01:01:27,120
It was the first presidential debate of 
the 2004 election.

1247
01:01:28,770 --> 01:01:30,090
He,
gemini,

1248
01:01:30,190 --> 01:01:31,023
I in the car,
we'd been at some hurricane center 

1249
01:01:34,740 --> 01:01:35,573
somewhere and jeb turns to him and says,
I think it's time to for you to go to 

1250
01:01:41,340 --> 01:01:42,630
hotel,
you need to.

1251
01:01:42,750 --> 01:01:46,950
You really need to bone up and study 
some bushes.

1252
01:01:46,951 --> 01:01:47,491
Like,
nah,

1253
01:01:47,491 --> 01:01:49,980
you know I'm going to whip his ass.
He was kind of a job.

1254
01:01:49,981 --> 01:01:54,300
He was kind of a frat boy alone.
He was kind of a frat boy,

1255
01:01:54,330 --> 01:01:56,840
jocular funding crack jokes,
you know,

1256
01:01:56,880 --> 01:01:59,910
smarted off.
I'm never inappropriately,

1257
01:01:59,911 --> 01:02:04,911
but just an ordinary human being.
So these two brothers get in a fight and

1258
01:02:06,091 --> 01:02:08,220
I'm sitting in the jump seat facing the 
president,

1259
01:02:08,221 --> 01:02:09,054
like imu and jeb sitting there and 
they're arguing about whether they 

1260
01:02:11,771 --> 01:02:14,190
should go back to the hotel or now in 
jeb looks at me and said,

1261
01:02:16,160 --> 01:02:17,730
lee,
and I'm like,

1262
01:02:18,260 --> 01:02:20,010
I am not going to the fight between two

1263
01:02:20,010 --> 01:02:20,843
brothers,
one who's the governor of a swing state 

1264
01:02:22,291 --> 01:02:23,124
that we've got to witness election then,
and the other guy happens to be the 

1265
01:02:24,991 --> 01:02:26,370
president.
United stAtes in my boss.

1266
01:02:26,520 --> 01:02:29,130
I'm staying out of that pipe boys and 
what happened?

1267
01:02:29,340 --> 01:02:34,340
I stayed out of the fight and bush went 
to the first debate and lost big time to

1268
01:02:34,741 --> 01:02:36,440
john kerry.
Very good.

1269
01:02:36,840 --> 01:02:37,673
Well listen,
it's really been a pleasure talking to 

1270
01:02:38,791 --> 01:02:40,710
you.
I hope we cleaned up some of this stuff.

1271
01:02:40,890 --> 01:02:43,330
Did we hit everything that that 
should've been hit on?

1272
01:02:43,830 --> 01:02:44,663
Are you kidding?
I,

1273
01:02:45,120 --> 01:02:46,530
I mean,
I know we four more days that.

1274
01:02:46,690 --> 01:02:48,710
Yeah,
you gotta go do your radio show.

1275
01:02:48,730 --> 01:02:51,720
Not too far from here,
but I suspect we'll do this again.

1276
01:02:51,810 --> 01:02:52,630
I hope so.
Yeah,

1277
01:02:52,630 --> 01:02:54,000
it was a pleasure.
Absolutely.

1278
01:02:54,001 --> 01:02:55,020
Oh,
and by the way,

1279
01:02:55,021 --> 01:02:57,150
I want to mention I've talked to the 
people over here,

1280
01:02:57,840 --> 01:02:58,673
for those of you that follow us on 
patriot on so many of you know that my 

1281
01:03:01,111 --> 01:03:01,831
dog,
emma,

1282
01:03:01,831 --> 01:03:05,880
is a rescue from hurricane katrina and 
she's got a really wonderful story.

1283
01:03:06,060 --> 01:03:07,570
Uh,
so we did a video of,

1284
01:03:07,600 --> 01:03:08,433
of michael meeting amma before and I,
and I told her story and that's an 

1285
01:03:11,621 --> 01:03:15,030
unpatriotic and for more on michael and 
you can follow him on twitter.

1286
01:03:15,031 --> 01:03:17,340
it's at Michael Brown,
usa.
