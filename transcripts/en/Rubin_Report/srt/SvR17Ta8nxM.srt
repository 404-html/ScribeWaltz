1
00:00:04,430 --> 00:00:05,263
All right,
we are on location at the blaze studios 

2
00:00:07,941 --> 00:00:08,774
here in Dallas,
Texas and I'm sitting across from Mr 

3
00:00:12,590 --> 00:00:13,960
Blades.
Glenn Beck or I sir,

4
00:00:14,030 --> 00:00:14,810
how's it going?
My man.

5
00:00:14,810 --> 00:00:15,643
Good to see you.
Thank you for letting us do an on 

6
00:00:17,091 --> 00:00:18,090
location.
Shoot.

7
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:19,433
Not a problem.
I know you're here for about 10 minutes 

8
00:00:21,481 --> 00:00:22,314
and then you're,
I think you're going to probably be on 

9
00:00:23,521 --> 00:00:25,810
the moon and then a stop at the Mars and

10
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:28,280
you know a little bit about traveling a 
lot.

11
00:00:29,270 --> 00:00:31,100
So I'm in between a thousand things 
here.

12
00:00:31,110 --> 00:00:32,190
Uh,
yeah,

13
00:00:32,210 --> 00:00:33,440
it's,
it's pretty cool.

14
00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:36,410
I want to spend a lot of time talking 
about this book here,

15
00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:39,890
addicted to outrage,
but let's just do everything.

16
00:00:39,891 --> 00:00:44,810
So right now we're about two and a half 
weeks away from this big term election.

17
00:00:46,340 --> 00:00:50,690
I suspect something completely bananas 
over the next two and a half weeks.

18
00:00:50,691 --> 00:00:51,524
I mean you can already just see between 
between the cabin are stuff that we've 

19
00:00:53,811 --> 00:00:54,644
been dealing with the general outrage 
and all the things you're writing about 

20
00:00:56,751 --> 00:00:57,584
here.
I just said this to a group of friends 

21
00:00:59,661 --> 00:01:00,494
the other day.

22
00:01:02,060 --> 00:01:06,350
I think at this point a spaceship could 
appear.

23
00:01:06,590 --> 00:01:10,640
Okay and hover over New York City and 
it'd be like,

24
00:01:11,140 --> 00:01:12,620
oh,
I mean,

25
00:01:12,710 --> 00:01:14,660
I don't know what would surprise me now

26
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:17,460
will we be arguing about the gender 
pronouns are the aliens?

27
00:01:17,470 --> 00:01:17,610
Yeah,

28
00:01:17,610 --> 00:01:18,480
I know,
I know.

29
00:01:18,630 --> 00:01:19,463
It's,
it's absolutely insane how everything 

30
00:01:23,701 --> 00:01:25,470
is.
Everything is upside down.

31
00:01:25,650 --> 00:01:26,820
Everything is upside down.

32
00:01:27,210 --> 00:01:29,400
Do you think,
do you think we're in a unique time?

33
00:01:29,430 --> 00:01:31,650
Because that's one of the questions when
I'm out there with Peterson,

34
00:01:31,660 --> 00:01:33,120
often people will say,
okay,

35
00:01:33,121 --> 00:01:33,721
it's,
you know,

36
00:01:33,721 --> 00:01:34,554
everyone says we've never been more 
partisan and were angrier than ever and 

37
00:01:37,531 --> 00:01:38,364
all of these things.
But there's something about this seem 

38
00:01:40,591 --> 00:01:41,100
unique.

39
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:41,750
Yeah,
I,

40
00:01:41,750 --> 00:01:45,900
I'm a,
I'm a glutton for history and uh,

41
00:01:46,050 --> 00:01:50,310
it,
we have been in perilous times before.

42
00:01:50,430 --> 00:01:53,700
I don't think we've hit the civil war,
uh,

43
00:01:53,970 --> 00:01:56,550
confrontations yet,
but we are approaching it.

44
00:01:56,750 --> 00:01:57,583
Do you think we really are,
because I can't do because I'm actually 

45
00:01:59,571 --> 00:02:00,404
worried about the amount of people.
I used to see this on twitter all the 

46
00:02:02,061 --> 00:02:02,661
time.
People saying,

47
00:02:02,661 --> 00:02:04,790
oh,
civil wars come in and you know,

48
00:02:04,791 --> 00:02:07,490
like,
just like murmur about what would be the

49
00:02:07,491 --> 00:02:09,650
most horrific possible outcome of all of
them.

50
00:02:09,870 --> 00:02:10,703
Or remind me to talk about the window 
because I think we have a window right 

51
00:02:12,871 --> 00:02:13,704
now.
Um,

52
00:02:14,730 --> 00:02:16,660
but we have been,
uh,

53
00:02:16,710 --> 00:02:18,360
we've been worse.
I mean,

54
00:02:18,690 --> 00:02:19,523
if you look at Jefferson and Adams,
Adams Adams was called a Hermaphrodite 

55
00:02:28,530 --> 00:02:29,610
by Jefferson Jefferson,
Jefferson,

56
00:02:29,940 --> 00:02:32,120
his campaign,
uh,

57
00:02:33,150 --> 00:02:33,983
called him a hermaphrodite.
Adam said back that if you elect Thomas 

58
00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:39,893
Jefferson,
there will be blood in the streets and 

59
00:02:41,941 --> 00:02:42,774
the heads of our children and your 
daughters will be on Pike's into every 

60
00:02:47,791 --> 00:02:50,210
town.
So we've had rhetoric like this

61
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:51,153
for ironically,
I'd be thrilled to vote for either one 

62
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:55,153
would be like,
I'll take either I don't care heads on 

63
00:02:56,771 --> 00:02:57,571
pikes,
that will be fine.

64
00:02:57,571 --> 00:03:00,100
But,
but it all does go to in the last couple

65
00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:00,100
of weeks,

66
00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:00,933
you know,
there was this Hillary Clinton Line on 

67
00:03:02,021 --> 00:03:06,760
cnn talking to Christiane Amanpour about
how we can't be civil because these,

68
00:03:06,790 --> 00:03:09,070
these people,
meaning the Conservatives or Republicans

69
00:03:09,250 --> 00:03:11,320
are so against our values.
I mean,

70
00:03:11,321 --> 00:03:13,990
this is dangerous stuff.
So here's the difference,

71
00:03:15,850 --> 00:03:20,850
we have been in these places before,
but we knew our founding documents,

72
00:03:22,510 --> 00:03:26,200
we knew who we served or who are God 
was,

73
00:03:26,230 --> 00:03:28,060
and I don't know who our God is now.
I mean,

74
00:03:28,061 --> 00:03:29,620
is it money?
Is it fame?

75
00:03:29,621 --> 00:03:32,440
Is it anger?
I don't know what our God is now.

76
00:03:32,890 --> 00:03:34,810
Um,
we knew.

77
00:03:34,990 --> 00:03:35,440
Wait,
can you wait,

78
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:36,640
let me pause you there for a sec.
So when you,

79
00:03:36,670 --> 00:03:38,710
when you say that about what the 
founders believed,

80
00:03:38,950 --> 00:03:41,830
now they were also saying separation of 
church and state the whole time.

81
00:03:41,831 --> 00:03:46,831
So if you were just laying out what they
believed when you say we,

82
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,070
who are.
God was,

83
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:50,950
um,
so George Washington,

84
00:03:51,010 --> 00:03:54,760
they did believe in the division of 
Church and state.

85
00:03:55,060 --> 00:03:58,180
Clearly I do too.
Um,

86
00:03:58,270 --> 00:04:01,540
that just means if you're an atheist,
you're an atheist.

87
00:04:01,541 --> 00:04:02,560
We're friends,
we're cool,

88
00:04:02,561 --> 00:04:05,920
let's get along.
But if you're a god person,

89
00:04:06,620 --> 00:04:08,660
you'd do your God thing.
You do your atheist thing,

90
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:09,513
right?
Do we have what Adam Smith called moral 

91
00:04:11,711 --> 00:04:14,170
sentiment in common?
Yes.

92
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:19,680
Capitalism has lost the first volume of 
Adam Smith.

93
00:04:20,620 --> 00:04:25,620
The second volume is wealth of nations.
The first volume is moral sentiments and

94
00:04:26,321 --> 00:04:27,520
that says,
look,

95
00:04:27,521 --> 00:04:28,354
this is an invisible hand and the market
is powerful and it will create whatever 

96
00:04:31,931 --> 00:04:36,100
you want.
Be careful what you ask for.

97
00:04:36,490 --> 00:04:40,780
Make sure you are always tempering the 
moral sentiment.

98
00:04:40,781 --> 00:04:42,970
Make sure that you're a good,
decent,

99
00:04:42,971 --> 00:04:46,990
fair minded people.
We've lost that.

100
00:04:47,050 --> 00:04:48,640
We're losing it,
I should say.

101
00:04:49,060 --> 00:04:52,410
Um,
and I'm concerned and I,

102
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:53,313
I talk about this a bit in the book.
I've seen this coming for almost two 

103
00:04:59,621 --> 00:05:00,454
decades and I had been warning against 
it and for the very first time I'm at 

104
00:05:07,061 --> 00:05:08,770
the place where I'm on the air now 
saying,

105
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:09,933
this is the time,
this is the time that I said would come 

106
00:05:13,900 --> 00:05:17,800
and now is the time for you to remember 
who you are.

107
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:19,153
Um,
and our outrage is taking us away from 

108
00:05:21,101 --> 00:05:24,730
it.
So as I've looked at this for so long,

109
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:29,290
I have,
I have studied revolutions,

110
00:05:29,291 --> 00:05:33,010
I have,
I've studied giant movements of chaos.

111
00:05:33,011 --> 00:05:35,020
I,
I can tell you about,

112
00:05:35,050 --> 00:05:36,490
you know,
uh,

113
00:05:36,550 --> 00:05:37,930
the,
um,

114
00:05:38,020 --> 00:05:39,830
I think it was the red month,
uh,

115
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:41,360
in the 19 thirties.
Like,

116
00:05:41,530 --> 00:05:42,363
I can show you what's happened,
but there were three people in for 

117
00:05:45,911 --> 00:05:49,450
people in grand movements that have 
gotten it right.

118
00:05:50,410 --> 00:05:53,530
There was Abraham Lincoln,
there was Martin Luther King.

119
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:59,200
There was Gandhi.
Then there's bond bonhoeffer.

120
00:05:59,420 --> 00:06:01,520
Do you know who dietrich bonhoeffer was?
I don't think so.

121
00:06:02,630 --> 00:06:04,940
Bonhoeffer last.
Okay.

122
00:06:05,580 --> 00:06:08,100
Bon hoffer was a,
um,

123
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:10,520
a,
a pastor,

124
00:06:10,820 --> 00:06:12,710
I think,
Lutheran in Germany.

125
00:06:13,430 --> 00:06:17,600
He was on the air when the fewer 
declared.

126
00:06:17,601 --> 00:06:19,280
He was furious.
He was taken.

127
00:06:19,281 --> 00:06:20,114
His broadcast was cutting short because 
he was doing a broadcast called the 

128
00:06:23,241 --> 00:06:25,370
furor principle.
This is wrong.

129
00:06:25,850 --> 00:06:26,900
Don't go this way.

130
00:06:27,730 --> 00:06:31,550
He on Kristallnacht.
The very next morning he was shopping in

131
00:06:31,551 --> 00:06:33,590
those stores,
those Jewish stores.

132
00:06:34,150 --> 00:06:34,983
I'm a pacifist.
He tried to turn the Germans back and 

133
00:06:39,771 --> 00:06:40,760
say,
stop it.

134
00:06:40,790 --> 00:06:41,720
Stop.
Stop.

135
00:06:41,721 --> 00:06:44,330
You're going the wrong way.
He couldn't do it.

136
00:06:44,331 --> 00:06:48,440
He eventually escaped from Germany.
Was in New York,

137
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:51,200
not here very long because he felt 
guilty.

138
00:06:51,290 --> 00:06:53,720
How can I leave my country when it's in 
this much trouble?

139
00:06:54,230 --> 00:06:57,920
He went back.
He realized there's no noise.

140
00:06:57,921 --> 00:07:00,740
Has Stopped.
This guy may be violence is the answer.

141
00:07:00,830 --> 00:07:05,830
He was involved in one of the attempts 
to kill Hitler.

142
00:07:07,010 --> 00:07:09,620
He went to a concentration camp.
He died.

143
00:07:09,621 --> 00:07:11,930
He was executed like five days before 
Hitler died.

144
00:07:12,650 --> 00:07:16,130
Here's the thing,
if you read his writings,

145
00:07:16,850 --> 00:07:18,200
he's gone to.
He's Jesus.

146
00:07:18,201 --> 00:07:19,670
He's Martin Luther King.
He's,

147
00:07:19,790 --> 00:07:20,900
he's,
he's got it,

148
00:07:22,130 --> 00:07:24,290
and I read them and read them and read 
them.

149
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:25,910
How?
Why did he fail?

150
00:07:27,290 --> 00:07:32,290
Silence in the face of evil is evil 
itself not to stand is to stand.

151
00:07:32,630 --> 00:07:35,330
He's got it.
Love one another.

152
00:07:35,540 --> 00:07:36,373
Don't.
Turret stopped playing the organ so you 

153
00:07:37,851 --> 00:07:41,140
can hear the train going down.
Twits.

154
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:42,073
Okay.
He failed because Germans had already 

155
00:07:46,221 --> 00:07:50,340
gone over the cliff.
They had because of world war one.

156
00:07:50,750 --> 00:07:54,620
Then the treaty of Versailles.
Then the 19 twenties,

157
00:07:55,220 --> 00:07:58,100
they had already lost their Judeo 
Christian principles.

158
00:07:58,101 --> 00:08:01,070
They had lost their center.
Remember,

159
00:08:01,071 --> 00:08:04,670
if it wasn't for England,
Gandhi would have failed.

160
00:08:05,060 --> 00:08:08,750
People think of Gandhi is starving 
himself to get the British to comply.

161
00:08:08,810 --> 00:08:12,650
No,
he starved himself to say to his own,

162
00:08:12,651 --> 00:08:13,484
people do not rise up in anger.
They were this close to losing and he 

163
00:08:19,491 --> 00:08:23,420
knew it.
He was appealing to the sense of decency

164
00:08:23,421 --> 00:08:24,254
and fairness of the British culture,
so he knew the people because of their 

165
00:08:29,721 --> 00:08:33,020
Judeo Christian worldview would see this
oppression and go,

166
00:08:33,050 --> 00:08:37,070
that's wrong.
If we have a window and it's closing,

167
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:40,310
if we give into our anger,
our outrage,

168
00:08:40,311 --> 00:08:42,290
and we say,
you know what,

169
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:43,153
I can't take it anymore.
We will lose and that window of the 

170
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:50,930
Judeo Christian values will close and 
then we're done.

171
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:52,153
Yeah.
It's so interesting because one of the 

172
00:08:53,241 --> 00:08:56,190
themes that keeps coming up as I'm on 
this tour is people

173
00:08:56,190 --> 00:08:58,680
keep asking me about this.
How much worse is it going to get before

174
00:08:58,681 --> 00:09:01,230
there's some sort of reset and all of 
these things,

175
00:09:01,231 --> 00:09:02,280
and it's like,
man,

176
00:09:02,370 --> 00:09:03,203
I don't want two months from now or four
years from now to look back at right 

177
00:09:07,381 --> 00:09:09,360
before the 2018 elections and go,
boy,

178
00:09:09,361 --> 00:09:13,380
weren't those the good old days because 
we've gone on on the train to hell.

179
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:15,960
So do you think there's actually no way 
to stop it at this point?

180
00:09:15,961 --> 00:09:16,560
Do you think that.
No,

181
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:17,750
I think they behind it.

182
00:09:18,130 --> 00:09:21,610
Here's.
Here's the scenarios that I'm looking at

183
00:09:21,780 --> 00:09:23,080
right now.
If I'm working gaming,

184
00:09:23,170 --> 00:09:24,790
yeah,
none of these.

185
00:09:24,820 --> 00:09:26,500
I know the prediction business always 
works out.

186
00:09:26,501 --> 00:09:27,610
So let's see here.
I got it.

187
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:30,940
So if you're wargaming yeah,
let's look at the next election.

188
00:09:31,150 --> 00:09:33,010
What happens?
Well,

189
00:09:33,340 --> 00:09:35,080
the Democrats probably gonna win the 
house.

190
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:36,490
Okay.
They win the house,

191
00:09:36,850 --> 00:09:37,683
you know,
they're going to at least subpoena his 

192
00:09:39,191 --> 00:09:40,024
tax records.
He's not going to give up tax records 

193
00:09:42,350 --> 00:09:43,930
and that will be brought to the supreme 
court.

194
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:46,480
Remember that marker number one day 
number one,

195
00:09:46,510 --> 00:09:50,290
day number two,
they don't have any place they can go on

196
00:09:50,291 --> 00:09:52,120
impeachment.
They have to impeach him.

197
00:09:52,570 --> 00:09:55,180
Even if they don't have anything they've
already said it.

198
00:09:55,181 --> 00:09:56,650
They have to do,
they have to do it.

199
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:59,890
It'll be the senate that will throw it,
will throw it to the Senate.

200
00:09:59,891 --> 00:10:01,360
That's where the trial happens.

201
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:04,030
So impeachment just means or taking you 
to court.

202
00:10:04,990 --> 00:10:08,440
So that's day number two.
Day number three,

203
00:10:08,900 --> 00:10:11,230
uh,
trump has already filed with the Supreme

204
00:10:11,230 --> 00:10:12,070
Court saying,
I'm not,

205
00:10:12,370 --> 00:10:15,130
I'm not testifying.
I'm not turning over my tax records.

206
00:10:15,370 --> 00:10:17,020
I'm not doing this.
Okay,

207
00:10:17,890 --> 00:10:20,500
well,
Kevin has already said he's already seen

208
00:10:20,501 --> 00:10:22,660
that that's a distraction.
The president shouldn't have to,

209
00:10:22,661 --> 00:10:27,190
so day number three when trump has 
brought it to the Supreme Court,

210
00:10:27,490 --> 00:10:30,100
then the house says,
wait a minute,

211
00:10:30,130 --> 00:10:35,130
Cavanaugh's should recuse himself.
We're looking at a year where,

212
00:10:36,460 --> 00:10:38,440
uh,
the three branches of government,

213
00:10:39,100 --> 00:10:41,180
the administration,
uh,

214
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:42,033
plus the house and the Senate,
both of them will be fighting with each 

215
00:10:44,891 --> 00:10:47,350
other.
They'll be fighting with this branch and

216
00:10:47,351 --> 00:10:48,880
there'll be fighting with the supreme 
court.

217
00:10:49,390 --> 00:10:50,223
When cavenaugh doesn't recuse himself,
they will file articles of impeachment 

218
00:10:53,650 --> 00:10:54,483
for him.

219
00:10:55,110 --> 00:10:55,943
And they're,
they're leading all of these ideas 

220
00:10:56,881 --> 00:10:57,480
already.
I mean,

221
00:10:57,480 --> 00:10:58,880
these ideas are trickling out or.

222
00:10:59,730 --> 00:11:02,150
Yeah.
So now you have the press.

223
00:11:02,210 --> 00:11:07,210
The fourth branch already in chaos has,
has absolutely no credibility at all.

224
00:11:08,870 --> 00:11:13,580
It's deranged.
And that pushes which you would call the

225
00:11:13,581 --> 00:11:17,090
fifth branch or the first branch,
the people into the streets.

226
00:11:18,530 --> 00:11:19,270
How do you solve?

227
00:11:19,270 --> 00:11:21,100
All right?
So before we get to the streets,

228
00:11:21,101 --> 00:11:24,910
can I give you the one option that I 
think maybe saves us from all of that,

229
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:29,680
which is that the Republicans win,
or at least hold in the midterms.

230
00:11:30,100 --> 00:11:31,780
Thus,
finally,

231
00:11:31,870 --> 00:11:35,560
as long shot is,
this is finally the Democrats go,

232
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:38,620
okay,
we've got to drop identity politics.

233
00:11:38,621 --> 00:11:41,110
We've got to get away from this 
socialist,

234
00:11:41,111 --> 00:11:42,170
Democrat,
Democrat,

235
00:11:42,171 --> 00:11:43,580
socialists.
Not that I.

236
00:11:43,580 --> 00:11:45,430
There's no evidence that they would ever
look in the mirror.

237
00:11:45,431 --> 00:11:47,590
If anything,
they've only doubled down every time.

238
00:11:47,930 --> 00:11:50,470
I see that as the only out to where 
you're going.

239
00:11:50,610 --> 00:11:53,590
So I think if you have,
if they don't win the house,

240
00:11:53,710 --> 00:11:56,080
if you win the house,
God forbid if they went in the house and

241
00:11:56,081 --> 00:11:57,130
the Senate,
then it's chaos.

242
00:11:57,490 --> 00:11:59,890
But if you win,
if they win the house,

243
00:11:59,891 --> 00:12:00,724
the Democrats,
that scenario is going to play out in 

244
00:12:02,711 --> 00:12:03,544
some form or another.
So that just gets worse and worse and 

245
00:12:05,471 --> 00:12:06,304
worse.
I was talking to a friend of mine just 

246
00:12:07,961 --> 00:12:10,510
last night about this and he said,
you know,

247
00:12:10,570 --> 00:12:14,350
just exactly what you said,
and I followed it up with what you said.

248
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:15,873
Show me the,
I know there's no evidence I am 

249
00:12:17,351 --> 00:12:20,140
spartacus is all of a sudden going to 
say,

250
00:12:20,710 --> 00:12:22,290
okay,
I'm not spartacus.

251
00:12:22,310 --> 00:12:23,200
Yeah,
you know,

252
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:26,450
I'm the carpenter from,
you know,

253
00:12:27,060 --> 00:12:28,320
from Nazareth.
Now.

254
00:12:28,740 --> 00:12:30,310
Wasn't that the danger all along?
And this,

255
00:12:30,311 --> 00:12:31,800
this is directly linked to your book.
I mean,

256
00:12:31,801 --> 00:12:33,960
I remember before the election I kept 
saying,

257
00:12:34,380 --> 00:12:35,213
yeah,
this is when I still considered myself 

258
00:12:36,121 --> 00:12:36,954
on the left and someone that had 
basically only voted Democrat my entire 

259
00:12:40,021 --> 00:12:40,854
life.
I think the one time I voted Republican 

260
00:12:42,061 --> 00:12:42,894
was a Bloomberg's third term in New York
City after he had flipped like 87 times 

261
00:12:46,771 --> 00:12:47,604
over or something.
I'm not even sure if he was Republican 

262
00:12:48,511 --> 00:12:49,950
at that point.
Um,

263
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:52,650
but that I kept saying before the 
election,

264
00:12:52,860 --> 00:12:57,860
if you keep calling trump Hitler,
then no matter what he does,

265
00:12:58,021 --> 00:12:58,854
and no matter what reality is,
you will never be able to get yourself 

266
00:13:01,651 --> 00:13:03,900
out of that little thing place you've 
painted yourself.

267
00:13:03,901 --> 00:13:05,340
And that's where we are.
So,

268
00:13:05,341 --> 00:13:06,300
you know,
it's crazy.

269
00:13:07,630 --> 00:13:10,960
I lived this,
I lived this.

270
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:15,370
I said I'm the guy who got in so much 
trouble saying,

271
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:17,980
I think Barack Obama may be a racist.
Now.

272
00:13:18,270 --> 00:13:21,520
I immediately corrected it in that on 
the spot and said,

273
00:13:21,550 --> 00:13:24,070
that's not quite right.
I now understand.

274
00:13:24,071 --> 00:13:28,270
I explain it in the book.
I now understand how to express that.

275
00:13:28,990 --> 00:13:33,430
I wasn't up on anti colonialism.
I certainly wasn't up on postmodernism,

276
00:13:33,740 --> 00:13:36,070
I wouldn't have,
so I'm hearing all these terms that mean

277
00:13:36,071 --> 00:13:36,904
nothing to me and yet they're always 
attacking groups to me and to a lot of 

278
00:13:41,651 --> 00:13:44,460
people in the country.
That's the definition of racist.

279
00:13:44,650 --> 00:13:49,390
Okay.
But I didn't understand the difference.

280
00:13:49,420 --> 00:13:51,280
The other part,
the other part at.

281
00:13:51,340 --> 00:13:53,590
Okay.
It's now social justice.

282
00:13:53,620 --> 00:13:56,740
Okay.
Well social justice seems wrong to me.

283
00:13:56,770 --> 00:13:57,603
That's how I defined it then.
That was so divisive what I said that 

284
00:14:01,751 --> 00:14:05,680
and I was really at the time struggling 
to figure out what is happening,

285
00:14:05,681 --> 00:14:07,060
how is,
who is this guy?

286
00:14:07,910 --> 00:14:11,200
Um,
and I got more and more straightened,

287
00:14:11,980 --> 00:14:13,150
uh,
and

288
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:16,210
didn't make a lot of friends on the 
left.

289
00:14:16,330 --> 00:14:17,163
Okay.

290
00:14:18,580 --> 00:14:21,370
It didn't work.
It didn't work.

291
00:14:21,730 --> 00:14:25,990
My base got stronger,
my bass learned things,

292
00:14:26,530 --> 00:14:31,530
but my base also as things went on,
got more and more angry as did I.

293
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:37,920
Why isn't this working well,
because you cannot call people names and

294
00:14:38,141 --> 00:14:40,060
expect them to come over.
We have,

295
00:14:40,061 --> 00:14:40,894
I just saw a new poll today that shows,
I think it's eight percent of the 

296
00:14:44,831 --> 00:14:46,300
American public.
8,000

297
00:14:46,301 --> 00:14:47,134
people interviewed,
eight percent of the American public is 

298
00:14:49,631 --> 00:14:52,940
the diehard progressive radical.
Okay.

299
00:14:53,530 --> 00:14:55,460
Um,
the,

300
00:14:55,550 --> 00:14:58,330
uh,
the never give up.

301
00:14:58,400 --> 00:14:59,233
Conservative.
Traditional conservative is about 29 

302
00:15:03,081 --> 00:15:03,930
percent.
Okay.

303
00:15:04,340 --> 00:15:06,790
They're both on the edges.
Twenty seven,

304
00:15:06,820 --> 00:15:08,330
29 percent,
somewhere in that area.

305
00:15:08,990 --> 00:15:09,823
Still on the edges.
The vast majority is now being called 

306
00:15:14,780 --> 00:15:19,310
the exhausted class and it's the class 
of people.

307
00:15:19,370 --> 00:15:23,120
And I'm in this guys.
It doesn't have to be this way.

308
00:15:23,510 --> 00:15:24,770
I don't.
I'm tired of this.

309
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:27,380
I know.
Not Everybody is a racist.

310
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:31,040
Not everybody is a homophobe.
It's the stop it.

311
00:15:31,460 --> 00:15:32,293
Stop it.
The cabinet Jordan Peterson got into 

312
00:15:34,911 --> 00:15:38,420
trouble and I tweeted,
I tweeted back to him.

313
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:41,850
I think this might be the first time I 
disagree,

314
00:15:41,851 --> 00:15:44,720
but I put I think because,

315
00:15:44,950 --> 00:15:45,960
well,
for people that didn't see it,

316
00:15:45,961 --> 00:15:50,260
basically he said that what would 
probably be best.

317
00:15:50,261 --> 00:15:52,600
And he did this in a tweet,
which is never the best way to do it.

318
00:15:52,640 --> 00:15:53,800
Idea.
And He's already.

319
00:15:53,801 --> 00:15:57,490
He's already had his mayor Kulpa on that
and released to a correct correction.

320
00:15:57,491 --> 00:16:00,350
A clarification in a blog form.
Uh,

321
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:01,233
but basically he said the best outcome 
would be the cabinet gets confirmed but 

322
00:16:04,031 --> 00:16:04,864
then steps down and what he meant was 
that wasn't saying the cabinet did do 

323
00:16:08,411 --> 00:16:09,244
anything or didn't do anything,
but if there's any chance for a little 

324
00:16:11,231 --> 00:16:14,350
bit of healing where everyone gets a 
little egg on their face,

325
00:16:14,351 --> 00:16:15,184
but also it gets a little bit of dignity
to walk away with and the country 

326
00:16:17,750 --> 00:16:20,710
doesn't come apart at the seams.
That was what he tried to do in a tweet.

327
00:16:20,711 --> 00:16:24,010
And in his blog post,
he's acknowledged that trying to do that

328
00:16:24,011 --> 00:16:24,820
in a tweet,

329
00:16:24,820 --> 00:16:27,490
probably not the best name,
trying to do that in a tweet.

330
00:16:27,930 --> 00:16:28,763
Um,
where the people who are reading it are 

331
00:16:30,551 --> 00:16:33,670
generally all about politics and tearing
each other apart.

332
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:35,450
Bad idea.
That's why I put,

333
00:16:35,590 --> 00:16:39,910
I think because knowing Jordan the 
little that I do,

334
00:16:39,930 --> 00:16:43,540
yeah,
he's a deep philosophical thinker.

335
00:16:44,140 --> 00:16:46,900
So my,
my feeling was,

336
00:16:46,901 --> 00:16:49,570
and it turns out it was right that he's 
looking at that and saying,

337
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:50,560
okay,
in,

338
00:16:51,020 --> 00:16:51,853
in a normal world,
in a good world where we're all really 

339
00:16:54,101 --> 00:16:54,934
trying to do the right thing.
And if we really were all trying to do 

340
00:16:58,421 --> 00:16:59,710
the right thing,
I agree with him,

341
00:17:00,460 --> 00:17:04,420
it would have been the best thing to 
have Jordan say,

342
00:17:04,470 --> 00:17:05,590
or,
or to have Kevin,

343
00:17:05,591 --> 00:17:07,150
I'll say,
thank you,

344
00:17:07,660 --> 00:17:08,493
thank you.
Now let's bring the country back 

345
00:17:10,061 --> 00:17:10,894
together.
Nominate somebody else and let's go 

346
00:17:13,061 --> 00:17:13,894
through.
But the other side would have gone 

347
00:17:14,891 --> 00:17:15,724
through exactly the same thing.
You would have rewarded them in the end 

348
00:17:18,281 --> 00:17:22,300
because they got it.
Because we're talking about the machines

349
00:17:22,301 --> 00:17:26,110
of destruction.
So reality doesn't play a role.

350
00:17:26,620 --> 00:17:27,453
At some point,
this 70 percent of America is going to 

351
00:17:32,021 --> 00:17:34,960
stand up and say,
shut up,

352
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:37,990
both of you.
Are you shocked

353
00:17:38,620 --> 00:17:42,430
how many people in that 70 percent are 
just afraid to do that?

354
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:45,760
Because when we do these meet and greets
after the peterson events,

355
00:17:45,970 --> 00:17:50,820
I think the number one question I get 
asked is what can I do?

356
00:17:50,821 --> 00:17:53,520
I'm afraid to speak and I cannot.
I mean,

357
00:17:53,521 --> 00:17:54,660
I see this,
you know,

358
00:17:54,930 --> 00:17:55,763
from people that I'm sitting this close 
to and I see this look in their eyes of 

359
00:17:58,441 --> 00:18:01,110
fear and it's like,
I don't think I'm that brave.

360
00:18:01,111 --> 00:18:02,730
I don't know why I'm doing this.
I don't.

361
00:18:02,731 --> 00:18:04,350
I'm just doing it.
I can't explain it,

362
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:05,880
but I don't wake up every morning and 
I'm like,

363
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:09,120
what am I going to do today to fight 
Google and fight the political powers?

364
00:18:09,121 --> 00:18:11,100
Or I'm just like,
I'm just doing what I think is right.

365
00:18:11,101 --> 00:18:11,934
That's it.

366
00:18:13,310 --> 00:18:14,940
That.
So that goes to.

367
00:18:15,990 --> 00:18:16,823
I brought my family thousand 11 to 
Auschwitz and I did it again because I 

368
00:18:23,071 --> 00:18:23,904
see over the horizon I think and we 
stood outside of the gates and we had a 

369
00:18:35,431 --> 00:18:37,740
prayer and then I said,
okay,

370
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:39,953
we are here because we have to look at 
the ugliest thing man has done and we 

371
00:18:47,281 --> 00:18:51,390
have to decide who we are,
who we're going to be.

372
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:52,793
Because if you weren't prepared,
and I don't mean prepare for that kind 

373
00:18:57,031 --> 00:19:00,330
of stuff.
I mean really know who you are.

374
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:05,730
You will not stand when the jackbooted 
thugs come down the street.

375
00:19:06,030 --> 00:19:09,120
You have to know who you are and what 
you believe.

376
00:19:09,750 --> 00:19:12,660
So I had them read a story of the 
righteous of the nation.

377
00:19:12,661 --> 00:19:17,100
They could pick anyone who saved Jews 
and really try to get into their head.

378
00:19:17,340 --> 00:19:18,173
I lined up in a,
a just a family kind of conversation 

379
00:19:21,091 --> 00:19:23,040
with this sweet woman.

380
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:24,780
She just died,
I think last week,

381
00:19:25,260 --> 00:19:27,990
90 years old.
She was a Christian.

382
00:19:27,991 --> 00:19:31,350
She was 16 years old when she saved the 
first Jew.

383
00:19:31,710 --> 00:19:35,640
Her whole family did it.
It was remarkable.

384
00:19:36,060 --> 00:19:37,470
Um,
and we,

385
00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:42,300
we talked about it.
Two things I learned on that trip.

386
00:19:42,630 --> 00:19:45,390
One,
as we were leaving,

387
00:19:45,990 --> 00:19:47,400
I said to her,
look,

388
00:19:47,490 --> 00:19:48,323
I have a responsibility that's different
than most because I speak to so many 

389
00:19:52,831 --> 00:19:54,240
people.
And I said,

390
00:19:54,241 --> 00:19:57,510
I believe that people have that tree of 
righteousness in them.

391
00:19:57,511 --> 00:20:00,570
I think they have that goodness.
They want to do the right thing.

392
00:20:01,140 --> 00:20:05,490
How do I water it?
She told me something so profound.

393
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:09,090
It's so game changing.
She,

394
00:20:09,290 --> 00:20:11,910
she looked at me so puzzled and she 
said,

395
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:13,793
you misunderstand.
The righteous didn't suddenly become 

396
00:20:17,281 --> 00:20:18,114
righteous.
They just refused to go over the cliff 

397
00:20:21,090 --> 00:20:21,923
with the rest of humanity.
All you have to do is remember what 

398
00:20:26,341 --> 00:20:29,610
you've always believed was true.
And they just stand and just go,

399
00:20:30,380 --> 00:20:31,590
no,
you guys are crazy.

400
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:34,230
You don't have to be a hero.
You're not a hero.

401
00:20:34,470 --> 00:20:36,680
She was looking at me.
She wouldn't let me film her.

402
00:20:36,850 --> 00:20:37,683
She only let me take one picture of her.
She wanted to nothing because she's 

403
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:42,390
like,
I'm not a hero.

404
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:46,350
I just remembered what was right.
That's remarkable.

405
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:48,490
Do you think that the default position

406
00:20:48,490 --> 00:20:49,323
of humanity is to cower?
That is that in these moments it seems 

407
00:20:53,051 --> 00:20:56,470
like it's a lot easier to cower,
right?

408
00:20:56,471 --> 00:20:57,304
I mean even now,
like that's the thing when people say 

409
00:20:58,961 --> 00:21:01,510
this to me about how do I get braver or 
whatever,

410
00:21:01,511 --> 00:21:06,511
it's like we live in the freest place in
the history of the world and if you're,

411
00:21:06,850 --> 00:21:08,890
if you're afraid now,
imagine the second.

412
00:21:08,891 --> 00:21:12,070
That thing gets turned a little bit 
about how afraid you are going to be.

413
00:21:12,071 --> 00:21:12,904
So it seems like like fear,
and I'm sure there's a psychological 

414
00:21:15,881 --> 00:21:16,714
component to this,
that fear does something in the brain 

415
00:21:18,371 --> 00:21:22,630
that may be bravery or,
or maybe it really is about just knowing

416
00:21:22,810 --> 00:21:23,840
what you are and what do.

417
00:21:24,060 --> 00:21:27,840
Let me tell you two stories.
I'm a first fear.

418
00:21:28,470 --> 00:21:30,700
Shuts your brain down.
Okay.

419
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:31,793
It's shuts reason down.
You're in fight or flight and that's a 

420
00:21:34,801 --> 00:21:37,560
good thing because you don't want to be 
going,

421
00:21:37,590 --> 00:21:38,281
well,
I don't know.

422
00:21:38,281 --> 00:21:41,100
Should I hit them a little harder 
swinging,

423
00:21:41,130 --> 00:21:46,130
so fear and anger really bad and that's 
why we're addicted.

424
00:21:46,291 --> 00:21:48,060
Outrage.
We will swing.

425
00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:52,500
You've got to get shake that or your 
won't think it's biological.

426
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:56,060
Two stories.
Um,

427
00:21:56,700 --> 00:22:01,700
the other person we met with in Poland 
was the chief rabbi and he said,

428
00:22:02,580 --> 00:22:05,250
I think it was 7,000.
There were 7,000

429
00:22:05,251 --> 00:22:08,640
people that stood.
And I was,

430
00:22:09,560 --> 00:22:10,200
I mean,
when you,

431
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:12,720
have you been outwards?
Now I have it when you go,

432
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:15,600
there's churches,
I mean a block away.

433
00:22:15,950 --> 00:22:17,910
There are houses everywhere.
And they were old.

434
00:22:17,911 --> 00:22:22,230
They were there.
And I left there and I was enraged.

435
00:22:22,290 --> 00:22:23,123
I remember her crying and,
and looking at the houses and screaming 

436
00:22:28,591 --> 00:22:31,260
in my head,
where the hell were you?

437
00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:36,560
Where were you?
I meet with him and I said,

438
00:22:37,040 --> 00:22:41,330
how out of all the millions of people,
and he said,

439
00:22:42,660 --> 00:22:45,620
you,
you're thinking that's a small number.

440
00:22:46,510 --> 00:22:49,340
You said that's an incredible number of 
people.

441
00:22:50,120 --> 00:22:50,953
People you're in a scary movie.
You look away when something like this 

442
00:22:56,661 --> 00:22:57,494
is coming,
it is human nature to look away or to 

443
00:23:01,701 --> 00:23:04,080
dismiss and you,
you,

444
00:23:04,090 --> 00:23:04,923
it's,
it's,

445
00:23:04,940 --> 00:23:05,773
it's,
um,

446
00:23:05,780 --> 00:23:10,780
we have this gift of fear that warns us,
but we use logic and sometimes we use it

447
00:23:13,371 --> 00:23:14,204
just to protect ourselves because Dave,
I don't think people are afraid of 

448
00:23:18,531 --> 00:23:19,364
standing.

449
00:23:21,270 --> 00:23:23,640
I think they're afraid of knowing the 
truth.

450
00:23:25,490 --> 00:23:26,323
You look at the people who stand,
the people who stand are the ones who 

451
00:23:30,441 --> 00:23:31,580
are going,
you know,

452
00:23:31,581 --> 00:23:34,430
I learned something new.
I learned something.

453
00:23:34,460 --> 00:23:37,220
It's changed me.
They're not standing.

454
00:23:37,250 --> 00:23:39,710
You're not standing because you're brave
and I'm going to take a stand.

455
00:23:39,950 --> 00:23:41,300
You're saying,
wait a minute.

456
00:23:41,510 --> 00:23:43,160
I just scales.
Fell off my eyes.

457
00:23:43,161 --> 00:23:47,440
I just learned something.
When you are inquisitive,

458
00:23:48,650 --> 00:23:50,630
when you are based in,
wait a minute,

459
00:23:50,660 --> 00:23:51,470
I,
I,

460
00:23:51,470 --> 00:23:56,470
I really want to know you have already 
prepared to hear,

461
00:23:58,851 --> 00:24:01,220
but do you really,
you and I,

462
00:24:01,430 --> 00:24:03,710
I know you know this.
I think we've talked about it.

463
00:24:03,770 --> 00:24:05,180
I went through it and you went through 
it.

464
00:24:05,750 --> 00:24:08,510
You do come to a point to where you're 
saying,

465
00:24:09,260 --> 00:24:13,310
if I take another step,
everything in my life could change,

466
00:24:13,370 --> 00:24:14,203
my friends might change.
They might look at me differently and 

467
00:24:17,271 --> 00:24:19,210
you take that step and say,
yeah,

468
00:24:19,280 --> 00:24:23,360
I want to know the truth.
That's where people fail.

469
00:24:24,530 --> 00:24:25,070
They.

470
00:24:25,070 --> 00:24:25,903
If you can't take that leap,
and that's why I really think you're 

471
00:24:30,921 --> 00:24:31,754
seeing people like you.
You're seeing the inquisitive because 

472
00:24:35,661 --> 00:24:37,850
that's in their nature to question 
question,

473
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:39,200
wait a minute.
That doesn't make sense.

474
00:24:39,201 --> 00:24:41,570
That doesn't make sense,
and if you're like that,

475
00:24:41,660 --> 00:24:42,493
you most likely have already passed that
line of uncomfortability because you've 

476
00:24:46,341 --> 00:24:49,100
had things that you realized you went,
Oh crap.

477
00:24:49,460 --> 00:24:50,293
Okay,
well I guess I don't believe that 

478
00:24:52,011 --> 00:24:52,510
anymore.

479
00:24:52,510 --> 00:24:53,343
Yeah,
and I just don't know how I could wake 

480
00:24:54,971 --> 00:24:57,970
up and put stuff in my hair and look in 
the mirror and go,

481
00:24:58,270 --> 00:25:00,190
that's why I just don't know how I could
do it,

482
00:25:00,191 --> 00:25:01,760
but I know some people do it and then I 
get.

483
00:25:01,810 --> 00:25:02,643
I think this is what Jordan would 
describe as sort of the slow road to 

484
00:25:04,241 --> 00:25:05,074
hell.
You will just diminish yourself and 

485
00:25:06,221 --> 00:25:09,430
diminish yourself every everyday of your
life until the end.

486
00:25:09,910 --> 00:25:10,743
You have to stop looking.
You have to turn around because it will 

487
00:25:14,770 --> 00:25:18,220
always present you with the option.
Oh,

488
00:25:18,221 --> 00:25:19,054
you saw it.
You looked out and you saw them just 

489
00:25:21,580 --> 00:25:23,350
lining up a family of Jews shooting 
them.

490
00:25:23,710 --> 00:25:28,000
Okay.
Now what do you do once you see it?

491
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:33,480
It presents you with a choice.
Do I go back to sleep or do I stand so

492
00:25:35,080 --> 00:25:35,861
I know every.
You know,

493
00:25:35,861 --> 00:25:37,690
it's very easy to always be like,
okay,

494
00:25:37,691 --> 00:25:38,524
both sides are going crazy.
They're equally horrible and all of 

495
00:25:40,871 --> 00:25:43,090
those things like that.
Sort of like the easy,

496
00:25:43,240 --> 00:25:44,073
the easy way of doing it.
I'm not saying that that's what you're 

497
00:25:45,221 --> 00:25:46,630
doing here,
but that's sort of the easy way to do it

498
00:25:46,631 --> 00:25:48,460
and we all fall in that trap sometimes,
right?

499
00:25:48,461 --> 00:25:51,550
Because just for brevity sake,
sometimes it's easier to say that,

500
00:25:52,210 --> 00:25:53,043
but it seems to me that for all the 
people that that absolutely despise 

501
00:25:56,471 --> 00:25:57,520
trump,
that,

502
00:25:57,610 --> 00:25:58,443
that hate everything about the right,
the right basically has been in power 

503
00:26:00,821 --> 00:26:01,654
for last two years.
There's a lot of good things happening 

504
00:26:03,491 --> 00:26:07,600
in the country related to economics and 
the fact that we're not entering foreign

505
00:26:07,601 --> 00:26:08,434
wars and there's some interesting things
happening with North Korea in a series 

506
00:26:11,081 --> 00:26:16,000
of other things and the state has not 
used its power to silence anyone.

507
00:26:16,330 --> 00:26:17,163
What I fear,
and this is why I don't think it's an 

508
00:26:19,300 --> 00:26:19,811
even,
oh,

509
00:26:19,811 --> 00:26:20,644
both sides are crazy thing,
is that the left is about state power 

510
00:26:25,330 --> 00:26:28,060
and what I fear is they've said,
well,

511
00:26:28,061 --> 00:26:28,894
half of the country's Nazis,
we cannot be civil with them because 

512
00:26:30,971 --> 00:26:33,730
they're coming to get us and if these 
people took power,

513
00:26:34,270 --> 00:26:35,103
well now we have everything that you 
just laid out because they don't mind 

514
00:26:37,541 --> 00:26:40,420
using the apparatus of the state to 
accomplish their goals,

515
00:26:40,421 --> 00:26:42,970
and I'm not saying Republicans are 
always write about this stuff and they.

516
00:26:43,180 --> 00:26:44,160
They screw up all

517
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:46,830
the little government things that they 
should care about and all of that.

518
00:26:47,490 --> 00:26:48,323
The left has become everything.
They said the tea party was that we 

519
00:26:52,321 --> 00:26:53,580
weren't.
We weren't.

520
00:26:54,450 --> 00:26:57,030
They have become violent.
They have become unreasonable.

521
00:26:57,031 --> 00:27:00,510
They want to silence people and they 
will silence people.

522
00:27:00,630 --> 00:27:04,500
That's why you're seeing people's start 
begin to stand up and say,

523
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:05,930
ha,
um,

524
00:27:06,090 --> 00:27:09,990
however,
it's one of my fears with Donald Trump.

525
00:27:09,991 --> 00:27:14,340
And the great thing is he says a lot and
most of it never happens.

526
00:27:14,580 --> 00:27:16,980
You know what I mean?
My fear is,

527
00:27:17,430 --> 00:27:19,080
um,
he has said,

528
00:27:19,081 --> 00:27:21,390
you know,
maybe we should look into the license of

529
00:27:21,391 --> 00:27:22,950
these companies.
You know,

530
00:27:23,310 --> 00:27:24,143
I don't think he means it,
but you signal that to people on the 

531
00:27:28,261 --> 00:27:31,470
right or the left your,
you're basically saying,

532
00:27:31,471 --> 00:27:32,190
yeah,
that's on the,

533
00:27:32,190 --> 00:27:35,910
that's on the field of play.
It's not on the field of play.

534
00:27:36,440 --> 00:27:37,273
Um,
although there's an interesting 

535
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:40,860
libertarian argument whether the 
government should be giving licensing.

536
00:27:40,890 --> 00:27:41,151
No,
no,

537
00:27:41,151 --> 00:27:41,984
no.
I don't think they should have license 

538
00:27:42,511 --> 00:27:43,101
at all.
Right,

539
00:27:43,101 --> 00:27:43,471
right,
right.

540
00:27:43,471 --> 00:27:45,720
I don't,
I certainly don't want the government to

541
00:27:45,721 --> 00:27:46,680
say,
you know what,

542
00:27:46,830 --> 00:27:49,260
you've been a little harsh,
so I'm going to look into your life.

543
00:27:49,320 --> 00:27:50,130
No,
right.

544
00:27:50,130 --> 00:27:51,510
Not at all.
Get them out of that.

545
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:52,793
Here's the,
here's the thing that people aren't 

546
00:27:53,911 --> 00:27:58,350
thinking about.
Government is about to become,

547
00:27:59,980 --> 00:28:00,813
unless it marries into it,
pretty inconsequential because it will 

548
00:28:04,841 --> 00:28:07,930
never be able to keep up with 
technology.

549
00:28:08,230 --> 00:28:10,180
So it was that the saving grace here?
No,

550
00:28:11,330 --> 00:28:12,163
not that I was going to give Google a 
lot of the left is concentrating their 

551
00:28:15,281 --> 00:28:20,281
power in silicon valley and that's where
you can really silence people.

552
00:28:22,300 --> 00:28:26,810
The guy who wrote IBM and the Holocaust,
um,

553
00:28:27,100 --> 00:28:28,090
gosh,
I can't remember his name.

554
00:28:29,050 --> 00:28:32,020
Really Brilliant Guy.
Well thought out.

555
00:28:32,650 --> 00:28:33,483
Um,
we were talking and I'm talking about 

556
00:28:38,701 --> 00:28:43,080
how the Germans,
how they silence people and how they,

557
00:28:43,140 --> 00:28:43,973
they coordinate people off and then just
get smaller and smaller groups and then 

558
00:28:47,761 --> 00:28:50,700
they eventually put you behind a wall in
a ghetto.

559
00:28:51,850 --> 00:28:52,683
Well,

560
00:28:53,290 --> 00:28:57,340
they would build the wall higher and 
higher so people couldn't hear or see.

561
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:02,030
Isn't that what Google and facebook are 
doing?

562
00:29:02,031 --> 00:29:06,620
We're building digital ghettos.
We have the ability now.

563
00:29:06,950 --> 00:29:07,783
You can speak all you want Dave,
but I'm changing the algorithm and 

564
00:29:12,291 --> 00:29:14,480
you're not going to be heard.
I mean,

565
00:29:15,050 --> 00:29:18,410
you look at what the deal with facebook 
was.

566
00:29:18,980 --> 00:29:19,813
I promote them.
I give them my 10 million listeners and 

567
00:29:24,771 --> 00:29:25,790
I say,
Hey,

568
00:29:25,791 --> 00:29:29,600
you can find me at facebook.
Let's communicate.

569
00:29:29,990 --> 00:29:32,690
Then they take those listeners that 
said,

570
00:29:32,780 --> 00:29:35,160
I want to hear from him.
Yeah,

571
00:29:35,710 --> 00:29:40,220
and then they changed the algorithm and 
I can't communicate to my own people.

572
00:29:40,610 --> 00:29:42,070
Yeah,
and know this is happening across

573
00:29:42,070 --> 00:29:42,903
the board.
You probably saw my insane tweet thread 

574
00:29:44,741 --> 00:29:45,574
about all of that.
I just started tweeting all of these 

575
00:29:46,931 --> 00:29:48,010
people,
real people,

576
00:29:48,040 --> 00:29:49,990
not Russian bots,
Russian avatars.

577
00:29:49,991 --> 00:29:53,590
I was taking purposely real people with 
real names and real pictures and they're

578
00:29:53,591 --> 00:29:55,870
all saying they're unsubscribed.
There were people who pay.

579
00:29:56,160 --> 00:29:58,740
It wasn't just the free people,
it was the people who pay for Youtube,

580
00:29:58,741 --> 00:30:01,810
red or youtube TV still getting 
unsubscribed and it's like,

581
00:30:01,811 --> 00:30:05,280
what did we all sign up for here?
But there I do.

582
00:30:05,380 --> 00:30:07,660
You like the biblical analogies.
I'll do one here.

583
00:30:08,530 --> 00:30:12,190
There was David versus Goliath and I 
think dave can take down Google

584
00:30:13,710 --> 00:30:14,543
this.
Dave.

585
00:30:14,760 --> 00:30:15,840
I think there's a chance.
I mean,

586
00:30:15,841 --> 00:30:19,050
I think that story,
I'm being slightly hyperbolic obviously,

587
00:30:19,290 --> 00:30:21,810
but I think that these things have 
become so big.

588
00:30:21,811 --> 00:30:22,644
I mean,
this I guess is what the essence of the 

589
00:30:23,281 --> 00:30:24,114
story was,
right?

590
00:30:24,390 --> 00:30:25,223
That this Goliath,
this Google has become so big that it 

591
00:30:27,481 --> 00:30:30,780
will crumble under its own,
under the weight of its own crap,

592
00:30:31,080 --> 00:30:31,913
basically,
that there will be enough people inside 

593
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:38,600
the broken machine that will wake up 
that hope that individuals basically,

594
00:30:39,390 --> 00:30:41,420
I hope all you got is hope,
right?

595
00:30:41,580 --> 00:30:42,413
Yeah.
And your,

596
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:45,960
your three to five years away from it 
being a cage,

597
00:30:46,290 --> 00:30:48,660
I mean,
their behavior with China,

598
00:30:48,900 --> 00:30:52,200
which I outline in the book is pretty 
horrific.

599
00:30:52,650 --> 00:30:53,660
Um,
what China,

600
00:30:53,740 --> 00:30:54,573
what the road China is going down is 
terrifying and Google is right there 

601
00:30:58,951 --> 00:31:00,320
with them.
Um,

602
00:31:00,570 --> 00:31:02,910
and that is evil.
That is evil.

603
00:31:02,911 --> 00:31:03,744
He said,
don't be evil.

604
00:31:04,020 --> 00:31:07,470
That is the definition of it.
Um,

605
00:31:07,560 --> 00:31:10,300
and if they just slowly,
you know,

606
00:31:10,890 --> 00:31:11,723
the guy who closes the door on the gas 
chamber was most likely a guy that was 

607
00:31:16,651 --> 00:31:19,890
fixing trucks before the war and a 
normal guy.

608
00:31:20,220 --> 00:31:24,810
You don't suddenly become evil.
You slowly move into it.

609
00:31:25,450 --> 00:31:26,283
Especially if you're surrounded by a 
group of people that are all absolutely 

610
00:31:30,151 --> 00:31:30,984
convinced that they are right and the 
other voice is wrong and therefore we 

611
00:31:35,251 --> 00:31:40,251
just have to filter them out with ai and
the way they are gobbling,

612
00:31:42,420 --> 00:31:43,253
um,
it's really disturbing and the problem 

613
00:31:46,711 --> 00:31:47,790
is going to happen.

614
00:31:48,210 --> 00:31:51,870
You know,
we're going to start hitting massive job

615
00:31:51,871 --> 00:31:53,280
loss,
probably 20,

616
00:31:53,330 --> 00:31:54,001
20,
20,

617
00:31:54,001 --> 00:31:55,290
21,
22.

618
00:31:55,830 --> 00:31:58,350
That's when you're going to really start
to feel the effects of,

619
00:31:58,380 --> 00:32:00,170
of Ai.
Um,

620
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:04,950
when that happens,
if you look at history and we know it,

621
00:32:05,220 --> 00:32:06,053
all the politicians now are saying,
I'm going to get those jobs back from 

622
00:32:07,801 --> 00:32:08,634
China because they're leaving China 
because they get into expensive in 

623
00:32:10,741 --> 00:32:13,200
China.
So you're not getting those jobs back.

624
00:32:13,260 --> 00:32:17,690
And especially because a ai and robotics
are,

625
00:32:17,900 --> 00:32:18,733
are growing.
We'll have 30 percent unemployment by 

626
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:21,953
20,
30,

627
00:32:21,960 --> 00:32:26,640
30 percent permanent unemployment.
So you look at this,

628
00:32:26,670 --> 00:32:29,940
what do politicians always do?
They got to find a bad guy.

629
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:32,280
Well,
right now it's China,

630
00:32:32,820 --> 00:32:35,130
but as soon as people realize that,
wait a minute,

631
00:32:35,160 --> 00:32:37,920
it's silicon valley that's taking my 
jobs.

632
00:32:38,490 --> 00:32:39,323
The then says it's those people,
those people that are building the 

633
00:32:44,361 --> 00:32:45,194
robot,
unless those people also see over the 

634
00:32:50,181 --> 00:32:51,014
horizon and become buddy buddy with 
their friends in Washington and they 

635
00:32:56,121 --> 00:32:56,954
work together.
Then you have a surveillance state that 

636
00:33:03,320 --> 00:33:04,460
I don't think we ever get out of.

637
00:33:06,520 --> 00:33:08,140
That's a lot.
That's all right.

638
00:33:08,141 --> 00:33:10,960
So I think the first time we sat down,
I think I asked you this,

639
00:33:10,961 --> 00:33:12,310
so this seems like the right segue for 
it.

640
00:33:12,311 --> 00:33:13,144
So for everything that we've talked 
about here and the addiction to our age 

641
00:33:15,431 --> 00:33:16,264
and all that,
there's going to be a certain amount of 

642
00:33:17,081 --> 00:33:18,790
people that are watching this and going,
wait a minute,

643
00:33:18,970 --> 00:33:21,610
Glenn Beck was one of the people that 
was peddling this stuff.

644
00:33:21,690 --> 00:33:22,523
[inaudible]

645
00:33:23,010 --> 00:33:25,500
I as well.
I think I know you pretty well right now

646
00:33:25,590 --> 00:33:29,460
and I feel like you are honest in your 
beliefs and you've.

647
00:33:29,480 --> 00:33:32,430
You've had some mayor Kulpa is about 
some of the things you've said.

648
00:33:32,700 --> 00:33:33,533
Even just a.
You got into something on twitter with 

649
00:33:35,790 --> 00:33:39,810
my friend in new eyes and you fully.
He sent you a clip of something that you

650
00:33:39,811 --> 00:33:42,630
did about him a couple of years back and
you fully,

651
00:33:42,840 --> 00:33:44,640
you apologized immediately.
You said,

652
00:33:44,641 --> 00:33:46,890
I'd love to talk to you and learn more.
And all of those things.

653
00:33:46,910 --> 00:33:49,260
Just about him today.
What he's coming in.

654
00:33:49,650 --> 00:33:50,483
Yeah.
And I know and I loop you guys in an 

655
00:33:51,391 --> 00:33:51,781
email.
Right.

656
00:33:51,781 --> 00:33:52,614
So,

657
00:33:53,040 --> 00:33:53,873
uh,

658
00:33:54,130 --> 00:33:57,070
is there anything you can add to that 
about just sort of how you've changed?

659
00:33:57,071 --> 00:33:58,420
Like,
do you remember a moment,

660
00:33:58,421 --> 00:33:59,254
was there something about that?
Because maybe there are people that are 

661
00:34:00,791 --> 00:34:01,624
going down that road right now that's 
still want more of the outrage and 

662
00:34:03,841 --> 00:34:05,440
stiller is still are,
you know,

663
00:34:05,650 --> 00:34:06,483
as they call it,
shit posting on twitter and the rest of 

664
00:34:08,621 --> 00:34:09,490
it.
Um,

665
00:34:09,730 --> 00:34:11,740
if you were trying to get somebody to 
turn back.

666
00:34:13,030 --> 00:34:13,863
No,
because they were really personal 

667
00:34:15,041 --> 00:34:18,160
experiences.
I went from the,

668
00:34:18,161 --> 00:34:18,720
you know,
that,

669
00:34:18,720 --> 00:34:21,610
that global poll that comes out around 
Christmas time,

670
00:34:21,611 --> 00:34:22,870
you know,
uh,

671
00:34:22,900 --> 00:34:24,970
most admired man of the world.
Yeah.

672
00:34:25,720 --> 00:34:29,800
I was tied with the pope just behind 
Nelson Mandela.

673
00:34:30,450 --> 00:34:32,050
Okay.
That's insane.

674
00:34:32,770 --> 00:34:36,730
That's insane.
Twelve months later,

675
00:34:36,760 --> 00:34:39,010
I'm no longer on that list.
I'm hated.

676
00:34:39,530 --> 00:34:42,640
I was saying the same things on CNN,
but I was saying on Fox.

677
00:34:43,480 --> 00:34:46,780
Okay,
so that was confusing.

678
00:34:47,460 --> 00:34:49,750
Um,
and it was,

679
00:34:50,860 --> 00:34:51,693
you know,
you can't be hated by half of the 

680
00:34:54,321 --> 00:34:55,670
country.
I mean,

681
00:34:55,671 --> 00:34:59,620
unless you're just a maniacal,
you know,

682
00:34:59,660 --> 00:35:03,710
ego maniac that is just beyond any kind 
of redemption.

683
00:35:04,040 --> 00:35:07,460
You cannot be hated by half of the 
country,

684
00:35:08,060 --> 00:35:08,990
you know,
a,

685
00:35:09,340 --> 00:35:13,280
a false hero for the other half of the 
country and not go,

686
00:35:14,420 --> 00:35:16,130
okay,
I'm not that.

687
00:35:17,940 --> 00:35:19,730
I don't think I'm that.
Yeah.

688
00:35:20,040 --> 00:35:24,570
So who am I?
What part of it most people will go,

689
00:35:24,930 --> 00:35:25,763
well,
they spent millions of dollars to 

690
00:35:27,151 --> 00:35:29,850
destroy my reputation,
to take things out of context.

691
00:35:29,851 --> 00:35:30,684
And they did.
But I also did things because my 

692
00:35:34,931 --> 00:35:39,600
philosophy at the time was if I can get 
enough eyeballs,

693
00:35:40,190 --> 00:35:43,500
if I can get people to watch,
which puts me in leader Hosan,

694
00:35:43,830 --> 00:35:45,870
you know,
singing Edelweiss,

695
00:35:46,010 --> 00:35:46,843
I can get people to watch.
Then I present them with facts and my 

696
00:35:51,811 --> 00:35:56,790
opinion of where it's going.
It forget about everything else.

697
00:35:56,910 --> 00:36:01,200
They'll hang onto the facts and someone 
in the press will go,

698
00:36:01,470 --> 00:36:03,750
I hate that.
So I'm going to prove him wrong.

699
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:08,190
They never did.
They never would look at the facts.

700
00:36:08,220 --> 00:36:09,053
So this is always where they just want 
to belittle you and changes to silence 

701
00:36:12,170 --> 00:36:12,650
us

702
00:36:12,650 --> 00:36:15,110
and I and I helped them.
Okay.

703
00:36:15,111 --> 00:36:18,200
I added to that.
So I'm not saying it's somebody else.

704
00:36:18,201 --> 00:36:21,110
I am taking my,
my responsibility.

705
00:36:22,760 --> 00:36:26,720
But the biggest thing is now on the 
other side,

706
00:36:28,700 --> 00:36:31,350
I can look and say,
wait,

707
00:36:31,890 --> 00:36:35,940
all of you in the press,
you said I was the worst.

708
00:36:36,760 --> 00:36:39,780
Let let me go get the transcripts.
See what I just said.

709
00:36:40,290 --> 00:36:43,500
That's what you said to the 10th power 
right here.

710
00:36:43,980 --> 00:36:45,090
It's,
they won't work.

711
00:36:45,150 --> 00:36:50,070
It's wrong and it won't work,
but nobody wants to do that.

712
00:36:50,071 --> 00:36:51,300
Nobody wants to look.
They.

713
00:36:51,450 --> 00:36:53,910
Everyone wants to point to the other 
person.

714
00:36:54,270 --> 00:36:57,810
Nobody's willing to go to me.

715
00:36:58,280 --> 00:37:00,530
But you think that 70 percent that you 
mentioned before,

716
00:37:00,531 --> 00:37:02,390
maybe you're starting to do that a 
little bit.

717
00:37:02,750 --> 00:37:03,201
I mean,
again,

718
00:37:03,201 --> 00:37:04,034
I'm trying to.
I'm trying to find how to get out of 

719
00:37:05,811 --> 00:37:06,644
this and.
And I think that 70 percent where I'm 

720
00:37:08,421 --> 00:37:09,254
meeting,
I know it's a select group because 

721
00:37:10,281 --> 00:37:11,114
they're coming,
they're coming to see me and Jordan and 

722
00:37:12,261 --> 00:37:13,330
take 70 percent.
Yeah,

723
00:37:13,420 --> 00:37:16,300
take 17,
10 committed,

724
00:37:16,330 --> 00:37:21,070
10 percent committed changes the world.
Seventeen is your tipping point,

725
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:22,233
so it doesn't take all of us.
Revolution was fought by about 20 

726
00:37:25,541 --> 00:37:27,380
percent of America.
Okay.

727
00:37:27,790 --> 00:37:30,010
Those were the ones who said,
I believe in this.

728
00:37:32,200 --> 00:37:35,740
We have to.
We have to understand it.

729
00:37:35,741 --> 00:37:36,574
A lot of the book is about postmodernism
and how that works and what its goals 

730
00:37:41,051 --> 00:37:44,560
are.
What does postmodern even mean?

731
00:37:44,561 --> 00:37:46,660
What is,
what's the modern world?

732
00:37:46,840 --> 00:37:51,250
It's not about a machine.
It's about the scientific process.

733
00:37:51,490 --> 00:37:56,490
It's about exploration and empirical 
data and testing a and B and living with

734
00:37:58,661 --> 00:38:01,240
the results.
That's what the modern world is.

735
00:38:01,810 --> 00:38:03,200
So when you realize,

736
00:38:03,230 --> 00:38:04,063
so you would say postmodern really is 
anti modern in essence it because it's 

737
00:38:07,551 --> 00:38:11,030
going against the ways that we've been 
able to measure anything.

738
00:38:11,031 --> 00:38:13,030
The way we've been able to look at it.

739
00:38:13,310 --> 00:38:14,143
Only you can.
When you don't understand postmodernism 

740
00:38:18,530 --> 00:38:20,450
and you read the headline,
which I did,

741
00:38:20,810 --> 00:38:25,810
math is racist.
You either go,

742
00:38:26,160 --> 00:38:30,920
these people are out of their minds and 
I can't take it anymore,

743
00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:34,010
or you can say,
how?

744
00:38:35,110 --> 00:38:39,400
How did they get there?
When you asked that question,

745
00:38:39,460 --> 00:38:44,460
you start to go and peel the layers down
and you see the core of this idea,

746
00:38:45,640 --> 00:38:46,473
good or bad,
that what came out of the modern era of 

747
00:38:50,530 --> 00:38:54,800
the enlightenment was this,
and they say,

748
00:38:55,010 --> 00:38:56,750
this is bad.
This is bad.

749
00:38:56,751 --> 00:38:58,040
That that really is it.
Yeah,

750
00:38:58,120 --> 00:39:02,290
and anything that holds this up must be 
destroyed.

751
00:39:02,380 --> 00:39:04,420
If that's math,
if that's you,

752
00:39:04,660 --> 00:39:08,560
doesn't matter.
If you understand that.

753
00:39:08,740 --> 00:39:12,940
It's all about deconstruction and 
deconstruction is all about chaos.

754
00:39:13,630 --> 00:39:18,040
You must not do anything to hasten the 
chaos it.

755
00:39:18,390 --> 00:39:19,223
You have to restrain yourself.
The best way to fight this isn't about 

756
00:39:21,791 --> 00:39:22,630
Gandhi.
Oh,

757
00:39:22,631 --> 00:39:24,340
I want to be just like Jesus.
No,

758
00:39:24,341 --> 00:39:25,174
I want to win,
and the best way to win is to restrain 

759
00:39:28,391 --> 00:39:32,530
yourself from adding any of the chaos.
Be Clear,

760
00:39:32,590 --> 00:39:33,760
be stuffed,
spoken.

761
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:35,830
Be the person that everybody in the 
room.

762
00:39:35,831 --> 00:39:36,664
When everybody is arguing,
they kind of look around the room and 

763
00:39:38,471 --> 00:39:39,304
there's maybe three people over there 
that are just laughing and having fun 

764
00:39:41,291 --> 00:39:45,400
and just because you will be the one 
that will control the room.

765
00:39:45,401 --> 00:39:47,620
In the end,
everybody else will kill themselves,

766
00:39:48,340 --> 00:39:51,910
but the the majority of people will go,
oh,

767
00:39:51,911 --> 00:39:54,940
I hate this,
and they'll make their way over to you.

768
00:39:55,780 --> 00:39:56,613
That's what we have to do.
We have to stop fighting on the stupid 

769
00:40:01,301 --> 00:40:03,460
stuff.
The stupid stuff.

770
00:40:04,570 --> 00:40:07,270
Gay wedding cakes.
Good God,

771
00:40:07,271 --> 00:40:08,104
man.
Feeling homosexuals right now today in 

772
00:40:11,951 --> 00:40:13,300
parts of the country.
What do you say?

773
00:40:13,301 --> 00:40:14,590
We start there.
What do you say?

774
00:40:14,591 --> 00:40:18,970
We talk about something that really 
makes a difference,

775
00:40:19,330 --> 00:40:22,660
really makes a difference.
We get to the gay wedding cakes.

776
00:40:22,720 --> 00:40:26,440
No,
it was just let's be good people first.

777
00:40:26,530 --> 00:40:27,363
Yeah.
It's so interesting how people just 

778
00:40:28,181 --> 00:40:32,950
don't want to do the intellectual work 
and now it's like we have these,

779
00:40:32,980 --> 00:40:35,830
we have these phones.
We have endless distractions.

780
00:40:36,190 --> 00:40:37,023
To the point that perhaps 20 years ago 
you might have a moment standing on a 

781
00:40:41,111 --> 00:40:43,870
corner waiting for a friend to go to 
dinner where you'd have to think,

782
00:40:44,200 --> 00:40:45,033
but we can distract ourselves to the 
point where we actually never have to 

783
00:40:47,891 --> 00:40:48,724
think anymore.
When was the last time you just stood 

784
00:40:50,861 --> 00:40:51,551
somewhere?
I mean,

785
00:40:51,551 --> 00:40:53,140
I know you're aware of all of this 
stuff,

786
00:40:53,290 --> 00:40:54,280
but where it was say,
have you,

787
00:40:54,281 --> 00:40:58,240
Glenn back just stood somewhere on the 
corner waiting for your wife to meet you

788
00:40:58,480 --> 00:41:00,820
and you weren't looking at your phone or
you weren't.

789
00:41:01,180 --> 00:41:04,120
You know,
I tried to do what you did,

790
00:41:04,150 --> 00:41:06,460
but I can't do it for a month.
Uh,

791
00:41:06,750 --> 00:41:08,090
many employees,
that's a problem.

792
00:41:08,360 --> 00:41:09,860
I only have like five.
Uh,

793
00:41:09,860 --> 00:41:10,820
I,
I,

794
00:41:11,120 --> 00:41:15,920
I try to do it once a week.
Don't make it every time,

795
00:41:15,921 --> 00:41:20,780
but just not going to be online.
Do not pick up your device,

796
00:41:21,080 --> 00:41:25,160
go out on a date with your wife and do 
not carry a device.

797
00:41:25,230 --> 00:41:27,300
Doesn't have it with you.
Um,

798
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:29,900
that's important.
And it's important,

799
00:41:30,200 --> 00:41:33,170
Dave,
because I learned something.

800
00:41:33,320 --> 00:41:34,153
My alcoholism.
I was struggling with so many things 

801
00:41:41,540 --> 00:41:44,270
when I was younger,
um,

802
00:41:44,380 --> 00:41:47,290
that I didn't want to think about.
I didn't want to think about,

803
00:41:47,310 --> 00:41:50,270
I didn't want to think about the things 
that I had done in my life.

804
00:41:50,570 --> 00:41:51,890
The things that I was,
oh,

805
00:41:51,891 --> 00:41:55,520
poor me about it,
just didn't want to think about it and I

806
00:41:55,521 --> 00:41:56,354
would turn on the radio and I'd turn it 
up loud and I'd be driving my car and I 

807
00:42:01,071 --> 00:42:03,650
never really consciously connected the 
two.

808
00:42:04,630 --> 00:42:05,463
It got to the point where it was so bad 
that if I didn't have something to 

809
00:42:08,381 --> 00:42:09,214
distract,
I would literally be by myself and I go 

810
00:42:11,380 --> 00:42:11,990
la,
la,

811
00:42:11,990 --> 00:42:12,910
la,
la.

812
00:42:13,180 --> 00:42:16,060
Just to block out my thoughts.
Okay.

813
00:42:16,390 --> 00:42:17,223
That's a problem.
And I realized when I was finally no 

814
00:42:22,571 --> 00:42:25,980
longer I was sober and not,
uh,

815
00:42:26,430 --> 00:42:29,050
uh,
and not just not drinking,

816
00:42:29,870 --> 00:42:30,703
uh,
was the time that I was driving 

817
00:42:33,461 --> 00:42:34,294
someplace and I must have been driving 
for about an hour and I hadn't turned 

818
00:42:36,701 --> 00:42:37,534
anything on.
And I realized at one point I'm just 

819
00:42:39,581 --> 00:42:41,240
driving and I kind of come to,
you know,

820
00:42:41,241 --> 00:42:42,720
kind of come to thinking,
you know,

821
00:42:42,860 --> 00:42:44,890
about what's in the car,
what's happening.

822
00:42:44,891 --> 00:42:45,431
And I'm like,
oh,

823
00:42:45,431 --> 00:42:46,270
I wonder what's in the rate.

824
00:42:47,070 --> 00:42:47,903
Oh my gosh,
I've been alone with myself and my 

825
00:42:51,521 --> 00:42:55,850
thoughts for an hour.
That's a sign of mental health.

826
00:42:57,270 --> 00:42:58,103
We're sick,

827
00:42:58,710 --> 00:43:01,390
we're sick.
So in the,

828
00:43:01,391 --> 00:43:02,650
uh,
in the book,

829
00:43:02,860 --> 00:43:07,030
in the forward,
you a very graciously,

830
00:43:07,031 --> 00:43:07,864
and I'm humbled that you did it,
you included me in a list of names of 

831
00:43:10,211 --> 00:43:11,800
people that you,
uh,

832
00:43:11,860 --> 00:43:14,020
that you put in there.
Um,

833
00:43:14,680 --> 00:43:16,070
and you know,

834
00:43:17,300 --> 00:43:19,640
ben had this and I wrote,
I even wrote to,

835
00:43:19,710 --> 00:43:23,570
to Ben,
I wrote an inscription on this page like

836
00:43:23,571 --> 00:43:26,060
two days later he calls me,
oh my gosh,

837
00:43:26,990 --> 00:43:29,510
we were with each other for two days.
And he was like,

838
00:43:29,511 --> 00:43:30,410
hey,
thanks very much.

839
00:43:30,411 --> 00:43:33,200
And then like at midnight one night I 
get this text,

840
00:43:33,350 --> 00:43:34,183
he's a busy guy and I know to those who 
are willing to step out in front of the 

841
00:43:36,471 --> 00:43:40,370
crowd to question reason and have 
dangerous conversations,

842
00:43:40,700 --> 00:43:43,460
men with whom I may strongly disagree 
with at times.

843
00:43:43,461 --> 00:43:44,294
But we'll all,
I will always consider real founders of 

844
00:43:46,341 --> 00:43:50,270
reason and contemporary heroes.
Ben Shapiro,

845
00:43:50,570 --> 00:43:52,340
Dave Rubin,
Jordan Peterson,

846
00:43:52,341 --> 00:43:53,870
Bret Weinstein,
Sam Harris,

847
00:43:53,871 --> 00:43:55,180
Jonathan Sacks,
pendulum let

848
00:43:55,210 --> 00:43:56,043
Joe Rogan.
So I thought I don't want to make this 

849
00:43:57,431 --> 00:43:58,264
about me.
So the one that I thought was most 

850
00:43:59,231 --> 00:44:01,720
interesting,
they're actually with Sam Harris because

851
00:44:01,721 --> 00:44:02,554
I suspect you guys probably,
if he disagrees with Jordan Peterson on 

852
00:44:07,301 --> 00:44:08,920
everything,
pretty much everything,

853
00:44:08,921 --> 00:44:10,810
policy,
existentialism,

854
00:44:10,811 --> 00:44:12,760
meaning of life,
the whole damn thing.

855
00:44:13,330 --> 00:44:16,000
You guys probably disagree on 
everything.

856
00:44:16,001 --> 00:44:17,890
Plus one.
I don't know if we went through,

857
00:44:17,891 --> 00:44:20,050
you know,
and I thought well this is what it's all

858
00:44:20,051 --> 00:44:21,940
about.
This is what it's all about.

859
00:44:22,180 --> 00:44:23,350
So.
But would you have ever.

860
00:44:23,410 --> 00:44:25,480
I mean 20 years ago,
if you were writing a book,

861
00:44:25,510 --> 00:44:26,343
you would,
we still would have done that when I've 

862
00:44:27,850 --> 00:44:32,250
often joked that my library is a library
of a serial killer because

863
00:44:32,250 --> 00:44:35,610
I was too broke to actually go get a 
formal education,

864
00:44:35,850 --> 00:44:38,850
so I would go to barnes and noble or the
library and I'd go,

865
00:44:40,230 --> 00:44:44,010
who hates each other,
this opinion,

866
00:44:44,460 --> 00:44:48,450
who hates this opinion,
that person,

867
00:44:49,230 --> 00:44:52,920
and I would read them both and I would 
look at them and say,

868
00:44:53,250 --> 00:44:56,100
is there enter anything where they 
intersect?

869
00:44:56,400 --> 00:44:57,233
Because that I know is true.
If both these people are from opposite 

870
00:45:01,261 --> 00:45:05,130
ends of the spectrum and they both say 
this is true.

871
00:45:05,280 --> 00:45:08,190
I know that one line in both books is 
true.

872
00:45:08,290 --> 00:45:09,123
Okay,
so start small and build the basis of 

873
00:45:11,731 --> 00:45:12,564
truth.
And what motivated me was aligned from 

874
00:45:15,091 --> 00:45:18,920
Thomas Jefferson that he wrote to his 
nephew Peter car.

875
00:45:19,770 --> 00:45:24,360
Peter's parents had both died when his 
dad was ill.

876
00:45:24,361 --> 00:45:25,194
He said,
can you please educate my son when he 

877
00:45:27,181 --> 00:45:28,014
comes of age?
So Thomas writes this unbelievable 

878
00:45:31,111 --> 00:45:31,800
letter.
You know,

879
00:45:31,800 --> 00:45:33,510
in mathematics,
you have to do this in literature.

880
00:45:33,511 --> 00:45:36,420
You have to do this.
The last thing is religion.

881
00:45:36,990 --> 00:45:38,760
I love it.
It's changed my life.

882
00:45:39,980 --> 00:45:42,570
Um,
when it comes to religion,

883
00:45:43,200 --> 00:45:44,033
above all things,
fix reason firmly in her seat and 

884
00:45:48,661 --> 00:45:49,494
question with boldness,
even the very existence of God for if 

885
00:45:53,041 --> 00:45:56,400
there be a god,
he must surely rather honest questioning

886
00:45:56,430 --> 00:45:57,630
over blindfolded fear.

887
00:45:59,260 --> 00:46:04,260
We break down on the word honest,
honest questioning.

888
00:46:05,740 --> 00:46:06,573
You and I like each other and get along 
because you haven't asked me a setup 

889
00:46:11,080 --> 00:46:13,420
question and I've never asked you a 
setup question.

890
00:46:13,840 --> 00:46:16,390
It's an honest question.
Hang on just a second.

891
00:46:17,800 --> 00:46:19,060
But that right.
But that,

892
00:46:19,090 --> 00:46:20,490
that is in.
That's good.

893
00:46:20,750 --> 00:46:22,270
Yeah.
That keeps you young.

894
00:46:22,271 --> 00:46:25,150
That keeps you alive.
The minute you start.

895
00:46:25,270 --> 00:46:26,920
I knew my father was going to die.

896
00:46:28,620 --> 00:46:32,410
My father was the kind of guy who always
had a book in this packet pocket.

897
00:46:32,590 --> 00:46:37,590
Okay.
Self educated man and a,

898
00:46:38,310 --> 00:46:43,310
there's always exploring and questioning
and he was so granola,

899
00:46:43,761 --> 00:46:46,610
fruit loop being one with the universe 
kind of guy.

900
00:46:47,150 --> 00:46:49,850
And um,
I call them up.

901
00:46:49,970 --> 00:46:53,750
We were best friends for a long time and
um,

902
00:46:55,290 --> 00:46:56,620
I'd,
I'd call them sometimes two,

903
00:46:56,621 --> 00:46:59,080
three times a day and we'd just talk 
about books,

904
00:46:59,081 --> 00:47:01,330
we're reading and things.
And did you hear this opinion?

905
00:47:01,331 --> 00:47:03,820
What do you think of this?
We talked about the future of the past,

906
00:47:03,821 --> 00:47:06,060
all of it.
And I said,

907
00:47:06,061 --> 00:47:09,960
Dad,
I just read this fantastic book.

908
00:47:10,200 --> 00:47:11,850
You have to read this.
I'm going to send it to you.

909
00:47:12,470 --> 00:47:15,570
And he said,
that's okay.

910
00:47:16,770 --> 00:47:18,890
And I said,
what?

911
00:47:19,640 --> 00:47:23,070
And he said,
I'm tired.

912
00:47:24,120 --> 00:47:26,610
I'm tired.
I think I've learned enough.

913
00:47:27,030 --> 00:47:29,110
Huh?
Three years later he was,

914
00:47:29,410 --> 00:47:32,370
he was gone.
When you,

915
00:47:32,460 --> 00:47:36,750
when you are not,
we're built to explore.

916
00:47:37,290 --> 00:47:38,730
And when you're not exploring

917
00:47:39,740 --> 00:47:40,573
what's left,

918
00:47:41,600 --> 00:47:42,433
w,
what would you be doing if you weren't 

919
00:47:42,871 --> 00:47:43,704
doing this?

920
00:47:46,970 --> 00:47:50,540
I told my wife when she married me.
This one reason I've lucked out so much.

921
00:47:51,110 --> 00:47:53,480
My wife hates fame.
She hates wealth.

922
00:47:53,520 --> 00:47:57,920
She hates red carpet.
She ate all of it because she married me

923
00:47:57,921 --> 00:47:59,500
and her family was like,
you know,

924
00:47:59,510 --> 00:48:01,250
got married him.
He is a loser.

925
00:48:02,150 --> 00:48:04,940
He's not going to a but he's not going 
to amount to anything.

926
00:48:05,620 --> 00:48:06,453
Um,
when she married me because I'm the 

927
00:48:09,231 --> 00:48:13,460
first out of every generation that we 
can find going back,

928
00:48:13,820 --> 00:48:16,910
I'm the first male that has not become a
baker.

929
00:48:18,050 --> 00:48:22,760
And so I would probably probably be a 
chef in some place or A.

930
00:48:23,210 --> 00:48:24,190
I'm not good at baking.
Yeah,

931
00:48:24,340 --> 00:48:26,110
I was just gonna say,
would you bake me a cake?

932
00:48:26,111 --> 00:48:29,110
That's the unknown.
I'm not good at baking pies.

933
00:48:29,111 --> 00:48:31,120
My father said baking

934
00:48:31,160 --> 00:48:36,160
sun is about formulas.
Cooking is winging it.

935
00:48:36,480 --> 00:48:38,240
Yeah.
And I'm not good with formulas.

936
00:48:38,600 --> 00:48:39,620
Yeah.
Impatient.

937
00:48:39,840 --> 00:48:40,481
You're,
you're,

938
00:48:40,481 --> 00:48:41,480
uh,
definitely a,

939
00:48:41,481 --> 00:48:44,930
a winging it Kinda guy.
So generally speaking,

940
00:48:44,960 --> 00:48:45,793
do you feel it's funny,
the first half of what we've done here 

941
00:48:47,840 --> 00:48:50,990
was sorta fire and brimstone sorta or 
laying out,

942
00:48:50,991 --> 00:48:51,680
you know,
this is,

943
00:48:51,680 --> 00:48:53,270
this thing could really go off the 
rails.

944
00:48:53,600 --> 00:48:56,210
I think the last 20 minutes or so it's 
been a little more hopeful.

945
00:48:56,960 --> 00:49:01,850
I'm an optimistic catastrophist you do 
not want me.

946
00:49:02,480 --> 00:49:03,313
You do not want to be anywhere near me 
on the titanic until we get to the 

947
00:49:07,191 --> 00:49:09,890
iceberg.
As we're going to the iceberg,

948
00:49:09,920 --> 00:49:11,300
I'm saying,
are you kidding me?

949
00:49:11,480 --> 00:49:12,070
Have you counted

950
00:49:12,070 --> 00:49:13,900
the lifeboats?
And there's not enough light bulbs.

951
00:49:14,110 --> 00:49:16,570
We're headed into cold area.
If there is,

952
00:49:16,660 --> 00:49:19,420
if these people,
they're going to be irresponsible,

953
00:49:19,421 --> 00:49:21,070
they're not going to pay attention to 
the ice,

954
00:49:21,071 --> 00:49:21,904
but they're arrogant.
They're gunna hit the iceberg and all 

955
00:49:24,870 --> 00:49:25,703
going to die.

956
00:49:25,870 --> 00:49:28,600
Okay?
Soon as we hit that iceberg,

957
00:49:29,020 --> 00:49:30,550
I'm there.
We're going to make it.

958
00:49:30,880 --> 00:49:35,290
We're gonna make it because I believe 
that when people are awake,

959
00:49:36,790 --> 00:49:41,620
they will awaken to who they truly are.
And I think Americans are different.

960
00:49:42,160 --> 00:49:46,330
We have this spirit in his,
of exploration.

961
00:49:46,780 --> 00:49:51,340
We're the people who crossed the oceans 
were the people that cross the rockies.

962
00:49:51,341 --> 00:49:52,174
I have to tell you if,
if I were alive during the time when we 

963
00:49:57,071 --> 00:49:59,570
were exploring,
I d,

964
00:49:59,590 --> 00:50:01,630
I don't even think I would have made it 
past the Missouri,

965
00:50:01,750 --> 00:50:04,370
but definitely I would have gotten to 
Denver and went,

966
00:50:04,430 --> 00:50:07,160
okay guys,
I am not knowing any.

967
00:50:07,260 --> 00:50:08,890
We're not crossing.
Okay?

968
00:50:09,280 --> 00:50:11,850
I always think every time I'm on the uh,
uh,

969
00:50:12,010 --> 00:50:15,550
what is it?
The five a that goes by the,

970
00:50:15,630 --> 00:50:16,960
the Getty Museum,
which,

971
00:50:16,961 --> 00:50:17,794
which is that

972
00:50:18,040 --> 00:50:18,401
the four?
Oh,

973
00:50:18,401 --> 00:50:18,850
five,
zero,

974
00:50:18,850 --> 00:50:20,590
five,
four.

975
00:50:20,591 --> 00:50:21,100
Oh,
five.

976
00:50:21,100 --> 00:50:22,980
We bumped to La.
So I,

977
00:50:22,981 --> 00:50:23,814
I,
I see the getty museum up there and I 

978
00:50:25,991 --> 00:50:28,130
think if I were a pioneer

979
00:50:28,400 --> 00:50:29,233
and I made it this far,
I would have built my house in this 

980
00:50:31,641 --> 00:50:33,530
valley and people would have been on the
top of the hill going,

981
00:50:33,890 --> 00:50:35,540
you should see what's going on.
I'd be like,

982
00:50:35,750 --> 00:50:36,583
I'm done.
But generally people are explorers and 

983
00:50:41,530 --> 00:50:45,880
they're good and they're,
they're hardy and they want to live.

984
00:50:47,160 --> 00:50:49,140
I think they do want to live and they 
want to live

985
00:50:49,960 --> 00:50:50,793
in peace and harmony.
I think that about the Palestinians and 

986
00:50:53,501 --> 00:50:56,020
the Israelis when,
if you could,

987
00:50:56,021 --> 00:50:58,390
and I've done it,
I've done it.

988
00:50:59,140 --> 00:50:59,973
When you don't have a camera in 
somebody's face and nobody knows you're 

989
00:51:04,211 --> 00:51:05,044
talking,
you sit down in a house of Palestinian 

990
00:51:09,040 --> 00:51:13,360
and most likely average person.
They're like,

991
00:51:14,070 --> 00:51:16,600
I don't really care.
I mean I just,

992
00:51:16,720 --> 00:51:19,600
I want to raise my family.
I just want to be left alone.

993
00:51:19,601 --> 00:51:22,270
I want to be able to eat.
I will maybe a little extra money,

994
00:51:22,271 --> 00:51:24,520
sole life,
and I can go off for a nice weekend.

995
00:51:25,180 --> 00:51:26,013
That's people.
It's when everybody starts telling them 

996
00:51:30,460 --> 00:51:31,420
it's them,
you know,

997
00:51:31,421 --> 00:51:33,910
that's keeping you down.
That's when there's trouble.

998
00:51:34,320 --> 00:51:36,680
You find it weird in a way that,
um,

999
00:51:36,800 --> 00:51:37,633
we're thought of as political beast 
because in a certain way we really 

1000
00:51:40,531 --> 00:51:41,364
haven't talked about politics here.
And I find now I'm probably less 

1001
00:51:45,991 --> 00:51:46,824
interested in politics now today than 
I've ever been in my adult life in a 

1002
00:51:51,961 --> 00:51:53,250
bizarre way.
You know what I mean?

1003
00:51:53,251 --> 00:51:55,500
Like I still,
I still love it at some level,

1004
00:51:55,680 --> 00:51:56,513
but like what we're doing here and what 
I think the real conversation happening 

1005
00:51:59,671 --> 00:52:02,640
in the world right now is,
is not political.

1006
00:52:02,790 --> 00:52:03,623
There's a class of people that are 
trying to make everything political and 

1007
00:52:05,611 --> 00:52:07,310
keep you confused and controlled.

1008
00:52:07,340 --> 00:52:08,930
Flooding the Russians.
Do you see the latest,

1009
00:52:09,530 --> 00:52:10,940
the Russians?
Believe it or not,

1010
00:52:10,970 --> 00:52:13,130
the Russians,
one of their,

1011
00:52:13,160 --> 00:52:17,300
one of their campaigns happened when,
uh,

1012
00:52:17,301 --> 00:52:19,820
I don't remember which was that the 
last,

1013
00:52:19,880 --> 00:52:21,500
the last star wars movie,
I think.

1014
00:52:21,590 --> 00:52:22,730
Oh,
I did see this.

1015
00:52:22,810 --> 00:52:23,930
They said that,
uh,

1016
00:52:23,990 --> 00:52:26,680
the last Jedi that it was Russian bots,
right?

1017
00:52:27,080 --> 00:52:28,250
Well,
that's what Ryan Johnson,

1018
00:52:28,251 --> 00:52:28,970
I guess

1019
00:52:28,970 --> 00:52:29,803
was there is evidence that they were.
They were politicizing the movie that 

1020
00:52:35,751 --> 00:52:37,730
they were.
They were putting out,

1021
00:52:37,760 --> 00:52:38,593
oh,
you're not going to like that robot 

1022
00:52:39,951 --> 00:52:40,910
because that robot,

1023
00:52:40,920 --> 00:52:43,150
it's all about social justice.
I remember seeing it.

1024
00:52:43,290 --> 00:52:47,050
The movie did suck and we okay,
I'm with you,

1025
00:52:48,270 --> 00:52:49,103
but what I'm saying is we have outside 
influences that are trying to make 

1026
00:52:53,450 --> 00:52:57,230
everything about politics.
Read the book,

1027
00:52:57,710 --> 00:53:00,230
Defying Hitler.
The best,

1028
00:53:00,590 --> 00:53:03,050
best explanation of what happened in 
Germany.

1029
00:53:03,051 --> 00:53:03,884
Ever written by a guy at the time as a 
warning to the west go and you don't 

1030
00:53:07,221 --> 00:53:08,540
know what,
you don't know where we've been.

1031
00:53:08,541 --> 00:53:10,790
You don't know what's happening here.
Warning,

1032
00:53:11,540 --> 00:53:13,710
and so he,
he really gives you a,

1033
00:53:13,860 --> 00:53:17,570
a look at what was happening prior to 
and you can see it.

1034
00:53:17,571 --> 00:53:18,500
You're like,
oh my gosh,

1035
00:53:18,501 --> 00:53:19,940
that's the world trade center going 
down.

1036
00:53:20,390 --> 00:53:21,740
Oh my gosh,
that's this.

1037
00:53:22,070 --> 00:53:23,720
You can see it.
We're repeating it.

1038
00:53:24,260 --> 00:53:25,590
And he says,
right,

1039
00:53:25,950 --> 00:53:29,790
right around 1933.
Nothing is not political.

1040
00:53:29,850 --> 00:53:32,250
There's not one topic

1041
00:53:32,640 --> 00:53:34,770
that is political.
When did this happen to us?

1042
00:53:34,800 --> 00:53:35,670
It's incredible.
I mean,

1043
00:53:35,671 --> 00:53:36,480
just,
you know,

1044
00:53:36,480 --> 00:53:40,140
I never watched cable news anymore and I
don't even watch sports channels anymore

1045
00:53:40,141 --> 00:53:42,930
because it's all political,
but when I'm doing cardio I'll just flip

1046
00:53:42,931 --> 00:53:45,900
channels and everything.
You go to his political.

1047
00:53:45,901 --> 00:53:48,840
The view is now always political.
If you're watching women's,

1048
00:53:48,930 --> 00:53:49,763
you know,
basically women's television in the 

1049
00:53:50,491 --> 00:53:53,730
morning.
The ESPN now is political all the time.

1050
00:53:53,731 --> 00:53:54,564
I mean,
every channel you probably turn on the 

1051
00:53:56,281 --> 00:53:58,720
food channel and there's some political 
situation happening.

1052
00:53:58,740 --> 00:53:59,160
Let me

1053
00:53:59,160 --> 00:54:03,390
tell you something that I've never said 
out loud.

1054
00:54:03,420 --> 00:54:06,270
Only person I think that even knows it 
in my own company.

1055
00:54:06,450 --> 00:54:07,470
Oh,
Stu,

1056
00:54:07,530 --> 00:54:08,363
my executive producer,
I couldn't tell you any of the names of 

1057
00:54:13,031 --> 00:54:14,890
the people that are running for House 
and Senate.

1058
00:54:15,160 --> 00:54:18,130
I'm on talk radio.
I don't care.

1059
00:54:18,760 --> 00:54:22,820
I don't care.
I pay somebody to look at that.

1060
00:54:22,850 --> 00:54:25,550
Tell me what's the balance of the House 
for the audience?

1061
00:54:26,210 --> 00:54:31,210
It does not affect me one iota except in
the big picture.

1062
00:54:31,790 --> 00:54:35,610
Which movement is moving.
I just it.

1063
00:54:37,380 --> 00:54:38,213
It's a waste of our time.
Think of how many man hours America has 

1064
00:54:44,311 --> 00:54:45,144
lost in the last 15 years.
Think of what we could have done with 

1065
00:54:50,431 --> 00:54:53,670
all of this time.
Forget about the money.

1066
00:54:53,710 --> 00:54:54,543
Is that the best argument for basically 
sort of classical liberalism or 

1067
00:54:57,121 --> 00:55:00,510
libertarianism that if we could just 
reign this thing in,

1068
00:55:00,930 --> 00:55:03,960
that not only could you live however you
want it to live,

1069
00:55:03,990 --> 00:55:06,850
basically if the government was just 
pretended protecting your,

1070
00:55:06,940 --> 00:55:09,270
your life and your property rights,
your rights,

1071
00:55:09,271 --> 00:55:11,850
right.
That not only would that be good because

1072
00:55:11,851 --> 00:55:12,684
you can do what you want,
but it would actually save you money 

1073
00:55:15,451 --> 00:55:16,670
until.
But yeah,

1074
00:55:16,740 --> 00:55:19,110
he would heal.
You'd still have it.

1075
00:55:19,560 --> 00:55:20,393
You'd have it still on the local side,
which would be great that that would 

1076
00:55:25,261 --> 00:55:27,930
actually,
you know what I mean is you'd still have

1077
00:55:27,931 --> 00:55:28,764
people who would try to take the local 
area and they'd be the big boss of the 

1078
00:55:30,931 --> 00:55:33,330
area,
so you'd have those things you'd have,

1079
00:55:33,331 --> 00:55:34,164
but at least you'd have a little more 
control over that you could control it 

1080
00:55:37,200 --> 00:55:40,230
or you could move to the next town.
You know what I mean?

1081
00:55:40,500 --> 00:55:44,760
San Francisco can be as weird as it 
wants to be.

1082
00:55:45,030 --> 00:55:47,400
They could live in,
you know,

1083
00:55:47,401 --> 00:55:48,234
six feet of human poop.
That's fine if that's what you want to 

1084
00:55:52,081 --> 00:55:52,914
do.
You know there's an app for the human 

1085
00:55:54,121 --> 00:55:54,954
poop.
Did you know that?

1086
00:55:55,120 --> 00:55:55,953
I'm not kidding.
There's actually an APP that tells you 

1087
00:55:57,691 --> 00:55:59,940
where human poop is on the streets in 
San Francisco.

1088
00:55:59,940 --> 00:56:00,773
I'm

1089
00:56:01,310 --> 00:56:04,160
literally going back.
It's insane.

1090
00:56:05,600 --> 00:56:08,150
It's insane.
I,

1091
00:56:08,151 --> 00:56:10,280
I,
I remember saying,

1092
00:56:11,090 --> 00:56:14,480
I remember saying to people,
there's gonna come a time where you will

1093
00:56:14,481 --> 00:56:15,314
not recognize your country.
What you thought was solid will be 

1094
00:56:18,021 --> 00:56:20,840
liquid.
What you thought was real will be false.

1095
00:56:21,860 --> 00:56:23,620
You're not going to it.

1096
00:56:25,560 --> 00:56:28,800
We're not only so far past that point 
now to where you're like,

1097
00:56:28,860 --> 00:56:32,250
I don't even know who anyone is.
I don't know what is real,

1098
00:56:32,251 --> 00:56:34,200
what's I don't know,
up and down anymore.

1099
00:56:34,590 --> 00:56:36,290
We're so far past that,
oh,

1100
00:56:36,510 --> 00:56:39,060
what's incredible and this is a good 
thing,

1101
00:56:39,061 --> 00:56:44,010
or could be a good thing because of 
technology by 20,

1102
00:56:44,011 --> 00:56:46,670
30.
You're not going to recognize it.

1103
00:56:47,190 --> 00:56:49,950
Anything.
Nothing will be the same.

1104
00:56:50,280 --> 00:56:51,113
Nothing will be the same.
It will be the difference between 

1105
00:56:54,450 --> 00:56:56,670
looking at our lives in 20,
30,

1106
00:56:56,671 --> 00:56:59,460
looking back and go and tave you 
remember 20,

1107
00:56:59,461 --> 00:57:00,294
18 when we sat.
It will be as different than as if we 

1108
00:57:04,021 --> 00:57:07,680
were sitting in now and going,
man,

1109
00:57:07,710 --> 00:57:11,300
can you imagine what 1920 was like?
It's going to

1110
00:57:11,400 --> 00:57:12,660
be that different.
You know,

1111
00:57:12,661 --> 00:57:13,494
this reminds me of a line.
I interviewed Peter Teal a couple of 

1112
00:57:15,271 --> 00:57:16,104
weeks ago and he said that crypto is for
Libertarians and ai is for 

1113
00:57:21,331 --> 00:57:24,750
authoritarians and I think that that 
sort of gets to the heart of what you're

1114
00:57:24,751 --> 00:57:29,070
saying because maybe what's going to 
happen here is that as our institutions,

1115
00:57:29,071 --> 00:57:31,020
our political institutions,
academic institutions,

1116
00:57:31,021 --> 00:57:33,660
media institutions,
as they become so big,

1117
00:57:34,320 --> 00:57:35,153
they can't sustain themselves anymore,
so maybe we will sort of break off into 

1118
00:57:38,731 --> 00:57:41,720
smaller communities,
whatever that means as well.

1119
00:57:41,730 --> 00:57:42,563
Sort of.

1120
00:57:43,970 --> 00:57:44,803
That's what the declaration of 
independence and the constitution is 

1121
00:57:46,760 --> 00:57:49,130
encouraged,
encouraged,

1122
00:57:49,660 --> 00:57:50,770
break off,
do your own thing.

1123
00:57:50,771 --> 00:57:53,740
You should be a little laboratory,
be a little laboratory.

1124
00:57:53,741 --> 00:57:54,574
You come up with something great.
I'm sure the other states and the other 

1125
00:57:56,951 --> 00:57:59,620
cities will adopt it if,
if it works,

1126
00:57:59,650 --> 00:58:01,040
we'll love it.
Stop,

1127
00:58:01,090 --> 00:58:02,110
stop the,
it's,

1128
00:58:02,230 --> 00:58:04,750
it's not one experiment.
Why are we so,

1129
00:58:05,110 --> 00:58:05,943
why are we so afraid of that?
Because I pushed that idea constantly 

1130
00:58:07,670 --> 00:58:09,160
and it's like,
you know,

1131
00:58:09,220 --> 00:58:09,970
just that,
that the,

1132
00:58:09,970 --> 00:58:12,790
that the laboratory should exist so that
if you want low taxes,

1133
00:58:12,791 --> 00:58:13,624
you go here,
but then if that screws over the 

1134
00:58:14,291 --> 00:58:16,630
schools,
then go somewhere else or whatever it is

1135
00:58:16,631 --> 00:58:17,464
that,
that play.

1136
00:58:17,530 --> 00:58:18,363
But people are really afraid of that,
that somehow we're not actually America 

1137
00:58:21,970 --> 00:58:25,840
if we don't live under the same exact 
laws everywhere at which,

1138
00:58:25,841 --> 00:58:26,674
as you said,
is the antithesis of the founding 

1139
00:58:28,031 --> 00:58:28,864
documents.
I think people just have been convinced 

1140
00:58:30,641 --> 00:58:31,474
that

1141
00:58:32,280 --> 00:58:34,800
people are not trustworthy.
Well,

1142
00:58:35,490 --> 00:58:38,940
people aren't trustworthy if they never 
get in trouble if they never.

1143
00:58:39,180 --> 00:58:40,013
Banks are not trustworthy.
If they never have to pay for their own 

1144
00:58:43,951 --> 00:58:45,960
mistakes,
they're not trustworthy.

1145
00:58:46,640 --> 00:58:47,473
Um,
when you have to pay for your own 

1146
00:58:48,511 --> 00:58:49,344
mistake,
you learn that when people generally 

1147
00:58:50,881 --> 00:58:53,190
become trustworthy.
You brought up Peter Teal.

1148
00:58:54,570 --> 00:58:57,660
People ask me all the time,
are you concerned about deeply?

1149
00:58:57,720 --> 00:58:59,640
Yes,
I'm concerned about deep platforming,

1150
00:59:00,030 --> 00:59:04,740
big time and especially Dave with what's
coming with,

1151
00:59:04,770 --> 00:59:09,770
with deep fakes and all.
There is trouble on the horizon.

1152
00:59:11,310 --> 00:59:13,320
Peter,
every time somebody says something,

1153
00:59:13,380 --> 00:59:14,980
I always say,
no,

1154
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:17,610
the guy who can solve this because Peter
Teal,

1155
00:59:18,450 --> 00:59:23,450
because we need a platform and I've been
left and right.

1156
00:59:23,840 --> 00:59:26,990
A platform whose charter is the bill of 
rights.

1157
00:59:27,380 --> 00:59:30,710
That's it.
If you agree with the bill of rights and

1158
00:59:30,850 --> 00:59:34,520
you're not trying to shut anybody up,
you believe in these things,

1159
00:59:34,521 --> 00:59:36,890
these human principles,
what make us human.

1160
00:59:37,100 --> 00:59:39,950
Go on what you think on here.
We're not gonna kick anybody off.

1161
00:59:39,951 --> 00:59:40,784
We're not going to do anything.
This is this a place where speech will 

1162
00:59:44,751 --> 00:59:49,340
be protected because thoughts are 
supposed to be dangerous.

1163
00:59:50,540 --> 00:59:53,900
It's only the dangerous thoughts that 
lead us to the moon.

1164
00:59:53,901 --> 00:59:57,920
It's only the dangerous thoughts that 
invented television or the Internet.

1165
00:59:57,921 --> 01:00:01,310
It's a dangerous thought that,
that said,

1166
01:00:01,540 --> 01:00:06,540
I wonder if I can make fire like the sky
does or that's a dangerous thought.

1167
01:00:08,210 --> 01:00:10,550
You're going to burn everything down.
Well,

1168
01:00:10,640 --> 01:00:11,720
he didn't.
Yeah.

1169
01:00:12,910 --> 01:00:16,380
Well,
I can't say more than if you saw my,

1170
01:00:16,381 --> 01:00:17,214
uh,
chat with Eric Weinstein a couple of 

1171
01:00:18,161 --> 01:00:20,770
weeks ago.
The billionaire class is talking now.

1172
01:00:21,280 --> 01:00:22,280
So there,
there is.

1173
01:00:22,290 --> 01:00:24,090
I'm happy to hear that.
Yeah.

1174
01:00:24,220 --> 01:00:27,100
One other thing on that and then I will 
let your staff do other.

1175
01:00:27,101 --> 01:00:28,120
I assume they have other work to do

1176
01:00:28,200 --> 01:00:29,033
around here.
You people do another work around you 

1177
01:00:30,690 --> 01:00:31,540
got things to do today.

1178
01:00:33,430 --> 01:00:38,430
Do you think that if we get out of this 
thing and it and it's basically okay out

1179
01:00:41,661 --> 01:00:42,494
of this sort of morass that we're in 
right now and that it's basically okay 

1180
01:00:45,500 --> 01:00:47,710
that we'll look back on this and think,
whoa,

1181
01:00:47,750 --> 01:00:50,810
there was something really good that 
came out of it because

1182
01:00:51,990 --> 01:00:54,960
yeah,
Barack Obama was my biggest nemesis.

1183
01:00:55,020 --> 01:00:55,853
You don't know.
You don't know what it's like to come 

1184
01:00:59,761 --> 01:01:00,594
under attack until the president of the 
United States and I've had two of them 

1185
01:01:04,441 --> 01:01:05,274
now is coming after you directly and 
using the force of his friends and 

1186
01:01:10,650 --> 01:01:13,860
allies to come after you.
Who was the other one they went after?

1187
01:01:13,861 --> 01:01:15,630
It was not trump.
It was trump.

1188
01:01:15,650 --> 01:01:16,111
Yeah.
During,

1189
01:01:16,111 --> 01:01:16,944
but yeah,
at the beginning.

1190
01:01:16,960 --> 01:01:17,760
At the beginning.
Yeah,

1191
01:01:17,760 --> 01:01:18,720
right.
Yeah.

1192
01:01:18,900 --> 01:01:21,420
So I'm call you after you basically were
like,

1193
01:01:21,421 --> 01:01:22,280
all right.
No,

1194
01:01:22,650 --> 01:01:23,320
no,
no,

1195
01:01:23,320 --> 01:01:24,540
I didn't get anything.
Nothing.

1196
01:01:24,580 --> 01:01:25,320
No,
no,

1197
01:01:25,320 --> 01:01:27,000
no.
And I'm fine with that.

1198
01:01:27,260 --> 01:01:28,560
Um,
uh,

1199
01:01:29,390 --> 01:01:30,223
what was,
what were we talking about that will 

1200
01:01:31,051 --> 01:01:31,884
come out on their side that we'll look 
back and this is going to Bama and 

1201
01:01:33,811 --> 01:01:34,644
Donald trump have been some of the best 
things that's ever happened to me and I 

1202
01:01:37,111 --> 01:01:39,260
don't mean financially or,
you know,

1203
01:01:39,330 --> 01:01:39,780
whatever.

1204
01:01:39,780 --> 01:01:40,613
I mean as a man because they've both 
taken me by the lapels and shoved me up 

1205
01:01:45,421 --> 01:01:46,254
against the wall and said,
what is it you really believe we are so 

1206
01:01:51,331 --> 01:01:54,870
blessed.
Do you know that really?

1207
01:01:54,900 --> 01:01:57,930
Even my father's generation,
he came at the end of,

1208
01:01:57,960 --> 01:01:59,190
you know,
he was born in [inaudible] 26.

1209
01:01:59,191 --> 01:01:59,851
So he,
you know,

1210
01:01:59,851 --> 01:02:04,851
he saw world war two and stuff,
but anybody who really grew up and lived

1211
01:02:05,161 --> 01:02:10,161
from 1946 until now,
we really have been very blessed.

1212
01:02:11,550 --> 01:02:12,383
But we've also been cursed.
No one has had to have everything about 

1213
01:02:17,851 --> 01:02:18,690
them.
Challenged.

1214
01:02:19,140 --> 01:02:19,973
I'm a better man.
You're a better man because every time 

1215
01:02:23,041 --> 01:02:26,820
somebody throws you up against the wall,
we will be a better country.

1216
01:02:26,821 --> 01:02:29,400
We'll be a stronger,
more vibrant,

1217
01:02:29,520 --> 01:02:30,353
more free people if we behave ourselves 
and learn from what's throwing us up 

1218
01:02:35,401 --> 01:02:38,160
against the wall.
That's how I ended in interview back.

1219
01:02:38,820 --> 01:02:39,653
Good work ethic.
