1
00:00:02,840 --> 00:00:04,490
You're saying different for our third 
show,

2
00:00:04,491 --> 00:00:06,830
we're going to get away from atheism and
religion today,

3
00:00:06,831 --> 00:00:07,664
believe it or not,
and we're going to focus on another 

4
00:00:08,661 --> 00:00:11,210
passion of mine politics.
Real quick though.

5
00:00:11,270 --> 00:00:12,103
I should thank all of you that listened 
to last week's direct message and 

6
00:00:14,781 --> 00:00:15,614
actually took it into action.
You guys are calling out the bullshit 

7
00:00:17,661 --> 00:00:21,050
artists on every social media platform 
like I've never seen before.

8
00:00:21,260 --> 00:00:23,330
As I said last week,
when you guys are engaged,

9
00:00:23,331 --> 00:00:26,780
we can focus on other things and not 
just have the same conversation over and

10
00:00:26,781 --> 00:00:27,614
over.
Uh,

11
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:28,493
I've really only been intimately 
involved in this conversation for a 

12
00:00:30,921 --> 00:00:33,740
couple of weeks fighting the lies.
It's not only exhausting,

13
00:00:33,741 --> 00:00:36,020
but it has also affected a couple of my 
friendships.

14
00:00:36,260 --> 00:00:37,093
Uh,
I really do think that part of the plan 

15
00:00:38,451 --> 00:00:39,284
by these people is to tire out the good 
guys and to giving up your part in this 

16
00:00:41,901 --> 00:00:43,700
debate is beyond crucial.

17
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:45,290
But enough of that.
Let's talk politics.

18
00:00:45,291 --> 00:00:48,080
I was at the gop debate at the Reagan 
Library last week.

19
00:00:48,260 --> 00:00:49,093
I've never been to one of these things 
before and I really had no idea what to 

20
00:00:51,351 --> 00:00:52,184
expect behind the scenes.
We had a booth in the spin room right 

21
00:00:54,141 --> 00:00:55,910
alongside CNN,
MSNBC,

22
00:00:55,911 --> 00:00:58,880
and Fox News.
The fact that they call it the spin room

23
00:00:58,910 --> 00:01:01,010
really tells you all you need to know 
about this thing.

24
00:01:01,011 --> 00:01:05,330
This is where campaign people and 
candidates go to spin their message.

25
00:01:05,570 --> 00:01:07,760
I went to the truth room next door,
but nobody was there.

26
00:01:07,820 --> 00:01:08,570
Weird,
Huh?

27
00:01:08,570 --> 00:01:09,403
We were able to snag surrogates from 
pretty much every candidate except for 

28
00:01:12,201 --> 00:01:13,034
Carly Fiorina and Donald trump because 
neither of them sent any reps to the 

29
00:01:15,651 --> 00:01:16,484
floor.
I even got to ask John a question about 

30
00:01:18,351 --> 00:01:21,050
gay marriage and Scott Walker,
a question about money in politics.

31
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:23,420
Come to think of it.
Maybe that's what caused him to drop out

32
00:01:23,421 --> 00:01:24,740
of the race earlier this week.

33
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:25,633
What I realized by being on the inside 
of all this is that there are some 

34
00:01:27,741 --> 00:01:29,810
unspoken rules to how the game is 
played.

35
00:01:30,020 --> 00:01:32,930
I talked to Mike Huckabee's,
campaign manager about gay marriage,

36
00:01:32,931 --> 00:01:36,470
and she basically just danced around it.
Had I pushed her to the breaking point,

37
00:01:36,471 --> 00:01:37,304
I probably would have never gotten 
access to her again and then word would 

38
00:01:40,451 --> 00:01:43,040
have traveled fast that I'm someone that
they shouldn't talk to.

39
00:01:43,220 --> 00:01:44,053
So with that in mind,
I tried my best to navigate all the 

40
00:01:45,771 --> 00:01:48,950
interviews with some basic questions and
then some deeper probing.

41
00:01:49,310 --> 00:01:50,143
I asked pretty much everyone about 
campaign finance and I really pushed on 

42
00:01:52,611 --> 00:01:53,444
social issues.
It was a big learning experience and 

43
00:01:54,801 --> 00:01:58,070
we'll figure out how to engage with the 
candidates and the representatives in an

44
00:01:58,071 --> 00:02:01,100
even more incisive way beyond the spin 
and the sound soundbites.

45
00:02:01,340 --> 00:02:04,700
Hopefully as the show gets bigger,
we'll get to more of the debates.

46
00:02:04,850 --> 00:02:08,210
Candidates will eventually realize that 
I'm going to be tough but honest,

47
00:02:08,430 --> 00:02:09,740
uh,
whether we agree or not,

48
00:02:09,980 --> 00:02:10,813
we're planning out our plan to go to the
first democratic debate and October 

49
00:02:12,861 --> 00:02:14,270
right now.
So stay tuned for that.

50
00:02:14,450 --> 00:02:15,283
So for today's show,
we're going to jump back into the 

51
00:02:16,521 --> 00:02:17,354
political waters.
I've got two comics I like and respect 

52
00:02:19,431 --> 00:02:20,031
Jimmy,
Darren,

53
00:02:20,031 --> 00:02:22,470
Felicia Michael's.
I agree with them on some issues and,

54
00:02:22,471 --> 00:02:22,640
and,
uh,

55
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:23,473
disagree with them on some others.
What I know more than anything else 

56
00:02:25,701 --> 00:02:29,060
though is that comedians have a way of 
holding themselves to a high standard of

57
00:02:29,061 --> 00:02:30,920
truth.
Sure will get things wrong,

58
00:02:30,921 --> 00:02:31,754
but the good ones have a fearless desire
to say controversial things and let the 

59
00:02:34,791 --> 00:02:37,430
chips fall where they may,
as Billy Wilder said,

60
00:02:37,431 --> 00:02:38,840
if you're going to tell people the 
truth,

61
00:02:38,841 --> 00:02:39,674
be funny or they will kill you.
I guess you could say the Comedians are 

62
00:02:42,111 --> 00:02:44,270
guardians of peace and justice in the 
galaxy.

63
00:02:44,271 --> 00:02:45,520
Just like the Jetta.
Well,

64
00:02:45,530 --> 00:02:46,363
except comedians usually smoke a lot.
All so I am with two of my favorite 

65
00:02:52,061 --> 00:02:55,280
political comics,
Felicia michaels and Jimmy Dore.

66
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:58,360
Most of you guys probably recognize them
from our old show,

67
00:02:58,361 --> 00:03:00,670
but they are new.
The all new Rubin report.

68
00:03:00,671 --> 00:03:03,130
What do you think of this?
This digs.

69
00:03:03,131 --> 00:03:05,560
Come on.
You have a great apartment.

70
00:03:05,740 --> 00:03:07,660
Pretty,
pretty sweet Jimmy.

71
00:03:07,661 --> 00:03:09,820
We have a gym.
There is a camera flying around.

72
00:03:09,821 --> 00:03:11,720
You love the job.
I do love the gym.

73
00:03:11,750 --> 00:03:12,880
You want.
You want somebody to.

74
00:03:12,881 --> 00:03:14,350
Comedy is 90 percent gap.

75
00:03:14,430 --> 00:03:17,220
Ninety Percent Jib and 10 percent 
eyebrow raising.

76
00:03:17,370 --> 00:03:18,151
Ah.
All right.

77
00:03:18,151 --> 00:03:20,280
Well then we're in good shape.
So what I wanted to start,

78
00:03:20,281 --> 00:03:22,650
we're going to do all that was good.
That was good.

79
00:03:22,910 --> 00:03:24,390
Uh,
so we're gonna do all politics.

80
00:03:24,420 --> 00:03:25,253
All right,
let's go see.

81
00:03:25,260 --> 00:03:28,800
Brought you guys on for politics.
I know you guys love politics.

82
00:03:29,010 --> 00:03:32,160
So unfortunately we have to start with 
Donald Trump.

83
00:03:32,161 --> 00:03:32,994
I hate that we have to start this way,
but I feel that we do because this is 

84
00:03:35,911 --> 00:03:39,060
the thing that has just consumed 
everything.

85
00:03:39,090 --> 00:03:40,010
So,
uh,

86
00:03:40,110 --> 00:03:41,880
I guess I'll just open it sort of 
evenly.

87
00:03:42,540 --> 00:03:45,000
What do you make of this trump?

88
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:46,913
You know,
the thing that irritates me most about 

89
00:03:48,381 --> 00:03:52,400
Donald Trump is how all my liberal 
friends are freaking out.

90
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:54,560
You know what I mean?
They're always going to get his hands on

91
00:03:54,561 --> 00:03:55,394
the button.
All that kind of red recognition would 

92
00:03:57,411 --> 00:03:59,570
you not up.
The only way he's gonna get his hands on

93
00:03:59,571 --> 00:04:01,730
the button is if that's what his wife 
calls his penis.

94
00:04:03,230 --> 00:04:05,940
It's just so crazy to become the 
president.

95
00:04:05,941 --> 00:04:08,520
You have no fears that this actually 
could be legit.

96
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:09,553
Well,
I,

97
00:04:10,050 --> 00:04:14,390
I think anything is possible.
I hope he doesn't become president and I

98
00:04:14,391 --> 00:04:17,540
mean it's scary.
The people that are attracted to him,

99
00:04:17,900 --> 00:04:20,990
that scares me,
you know that he gives a voice to that.

100
00:04:20,991 --> 00:04:21,890
That's frightening.

101
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:23,960
Yeah.
So we'll get to those people in a second

102
00:04:23,961 --> 00:04:25,690
because I do want to talk about them.
But the.

103
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:28,490
Do you think this thing is real?
I've been saying for mines,

104
00:04:28,491 --> 00:04:31,580
I think he's going to do three debates 
and we've already done two,

105
00:04:31,581 --> 00:04:35,280
but I think he's going to get to three.
He's still going to be peaking in the,

106
00:04:35,330 --> 00:04:36,163
in the rankings.
And then he's going to say I moved the 

107
00:04:38,241 --> 00:04:39,080
dial.
I'm out.

108
00:04:39,170 --> 00:04:42,080
And then he's gonna be the attack dog 
for whoever the nominee is that,

109
00:04:42,081 --> 00:04:44,690
that's my basic prediction.
Do you think this is real?

110
00:04:45,130 --> 00:04:45,963
Well,
I'll say what you want about Donald 

111
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:49,960
Trump.
He does make the racism run on time.

112
00:04:51,530 --> 00:04:52,363
Uh,
what I do actually enjoy listening to 

113
00:04:53,801 --> 00:04:57,370
Donald Trump speaks just because every 
once in a while you know,

114
00:04:57,371 --> 00:04:59,500
I'm in the mood to watch a Hitler 
documentary,

115
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:01,630
but I want to hear it delivered by Gary 
Busey.

116
00:05:02,830 --> 00:05:05,120
So that's why I'm really,
it's part Hitler par.

117
00:05:05,121 --> 00:05:06,130
Gary Busey,
that Kinda,

118
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:08,410
that Kinda works.
Donald trump.

119
00:05:08,411 --> 00:05:11,400
I predicted he would go away.
He doesn't really want to be president,

120
00:05:11,410 --> 00:05:12,850
he doesn't want you running,
do anything.

121
00:05:13,420 --> 00:05:15,490
He doesn't want to have to read up on 
anything.

122
00:05:15,700 --> 00:05:17,260
He doesn't want to have to learn 
anything.

123
00:05:17,261 --> 00:05:19,020
He doesn't want to have to.
But um,

124
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:20,730
so is that,
is that the craziest part of this?

125
00:05:20,740 --> 00:05:21,573
Because did you see about a week ago he 
was on this radio show and he asked him 

126
00:05:25,981 --> 00:05:28,320
the difference between Hamas and 
Hezbollah,

127
00:05:28,350 --> 00:05:31,200
that anyone that knows anything about 
world politics,

128
00:05:31,201 --> 00:05:32,034
anything,
you'd have to know a lot to know that 

129
00:05:33,001 --> 00:05:35,850
these are very different groups.
One is in Gaza,

130
00:05:35,851 --> 00:05:36,684
one is in Lebanon and Syria,
and he made it sound like it was a 

131
00:05:39,150 --> 00:05:41,100
Gotcha question.
What does that,

132
00:05:41,101 --> 00:05:43,640
the genius of him that every,
he turns everything into it.

133
00:05:43,641 --> 00:05:45,330
You see what the media is you have to 
be.

134
00:05:45,331 --> 00:05:46,780
Is that the real genius of that?
That's

135
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:51,030
not the genius thing of Donald Trump 
would carry the gene,

136
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:52,153
but here's the thing.
I would think the average American 

137
00:05:54,311 --> 00:05:57,100
doesn't know the difference between 
those two factions.

138
00:05:57,140 --> 00:05:59,690
And it's complicated and everything's 
intertwined.

139
00:05:59,810 --> 00:06:00,643
It's not a Gotcha question.
Anyone who's running for office should 

140
00:06:02,781 --> 00:06:03,614
know those answers and the fact that he 
can just keep going at it and going at 

141
00:06:08,481 --> 00:06:11,510
it and not taking any responsibility for
what he doesn't know.

142
00:06:11,511 --> 00:06:12,950
That's frightening,
you know,

143
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:15,500
and that people don't call them out 
more.

144
00:06:15,550 --> 00:06:15,971
Right.
So,

145
00:06:15,971 --> 00:06:16,804
all right,
so let's talk about the people that you 

146
00:06:17,861 --> 00:06:19,540
mentioned,
these people that are digging this,

147
00:06:19,541 --> 00:06:23,350
because I know you,
you rant and rave about politics all the

148
00:06:23,351 --> 00:06:25,030
time.
You hate the system,

149
00:06:25,031 --> 00:06:25,471
right?
I,

150
00:06:25,471 --> 00:06:26,304
I hate the system and what I think 
people are attracted to is that he's 

151
00:06:28,660 --> 00:06:30,340
calling the system out on their 
bullshit.

152
00:06:30,460 --> 00:06:33,520
So should we at least grant him that 
much that he has.

153
00:06:33,700 --> 00:06:35,290
You know,
when in the first debate when he said,

154
00:06:35,291 --> 00:06:37,030
well,
I donated money to Hillary.

155
00:06:37,031 --> 00:06:38,490
So she showed up to my,
uh,

156
00:06:38,570 --> 00:06:39,580
my wedding,
like,

157
00:06:39,700 --> 00:06:40,533
should,
we should give them a little credit on 

158
00:06:41,201 --> 00:06:42,040
that kind of thing,
right?

159
00:06:42,140 --> 00:06:43,330
Yes.
He gets a,

160
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:45,350
a little,
a little credit on that,

161
00:06:45,351 --> 00:06:47,690
but you will say what the genius of 
Donald Trump is,

162
00:06:48,050 --> 00:06:48,883
is that the geniuses that he knows,
it'll appeal to people who are not 

163
00:06:52,011 --> 00:06:53,860
geniuses.
Right?

164
00:06:54,020 --> 00:06:54,731
Right.
So that's,

165
00:06:54,731 --> 00:06:57,410
she's not appealing to smart people,
just like Ben Carson.

166
00:06:57,411 --> 00:06:59,890
Right.
So Ben Carson also butts butts.

167
00:06:59,930 --> 00:07:00,763
I respect Ben Carson more than I.
I do Donald Trump and I don't respect 

168
00:07:03,770 --> 00:07:05,390
respect Ben Carson and.
All right,

169
00:07:05,660 --> 00:07:07,790
well there you go.
So trump's in negative territory.

170
00:07:07,791 --> 00:07:08,690
Yeah.
So I mean,

171
00:07:08,691 --> 00:07:10,910
so what he's doing is he's gaining more 
support.

172
00:07:10,950 --> 00:07:11,783
Ben Carson,
I ironically with racists but not 

173
00:07:15,171 --> 00:07:16,910
getting support with other 
neurosurgeons.

174
00:07:16,911 --> 00:07:17,744
Isn't that interesting?

175
00:07:18,870 --> 00:07:19,480
Well,
right.

176
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:21,160
Well first off,
just Ben Carson real quick.

177
00:07:21,161 --> 00:07:21,994
I mean,
can a neurosurgeon not believe in 

178
00:07:23,351 --> 00:07:24,360
evolution?
Don't.

179
00:07:24,580 --> 00:07:28,090
Wouldn't that be a warrant to take your 
license away?

180
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:28,993
The stuff that he says,
he said a couple of weeks ago that the 

181
00:07:31,281 --> 00:07:34,820
number one killer of African Americans 
are abortions.

182
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:35,793
And when he said that,
I literally was like our cops giving 

183
00:07:39,201 --> 00:07:43,670
abortions and crazy.
It's so insane.

184
00:07:43,860 --> 00:07:44,693
What do we do with this whole group?
I just said in the intro to this thing 

185
00:07:47,041 --> 00:07:50,430
that I went to the gop debate.
I talked to a couple of these guys.

186
00:07:50,431 --> 00:07:51,264
I think casick is sorta a decent guy.
I think Marco Rubio is at least in the 

187
00:07:54,901 --> 00:07:55,734
right line of work,
even if I disagree with him on a lot of 

188
00:07:57,541 --> 00:07:58,374
stuff,
but what do you think about trump's 

189
00:08:00,061 --> 00:08:00,894
place in this?
It seems to me they all seem like 

190
00:08:02,191 --> 00:08:05,400
children that can't get the attention of
their dad,

191
00:08:05,460 --> 00:08:06,850
you know,
he seems to be dead.

192
00:08:06,851 --> 00:08:08,420
That's getting all the attention and the
kids can't.

193
00:08:08,530 --> 00:08:11,020
Well,
let's go back to his supporters.

194
00:08:11,190 --> 00:08:12,710
Donald Trump's.
I mean,

195
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:17,290
I'm there for instance,
women are,

196
00:08:17,310 --> 00:08:19,920
it's like when he,
he said Carly Fiorina's face,

197
00:08:19,930 --> 00:08:20,763
you can't have that face.
And then his poll numbers went up with 

198
00:08:23,261 --> 00:08:24,730
women who hate themselves.
Yeah.

199
00:08:24,870 --> 00:08:28,060
So that's really what's.
And so,

200
00:08:28,061 --> 00:08:28,894
and a lot of people don't say the 
mainstream news media won't call him 

201
00:08:31,031 --> 00:08:31,864
racist.
They'll say his controversial comments 

202
00:08:34,091 --> 00:08:35,860
on immigration,
uh,

203
00:08:35,861 --> 00:08:38,500
and they won't call them fascist,
which is exactly what this is,

204
00:08:38,501 --> 00:08:39,490
what it looks like,
right?

205
00:08:39,491 --> 00:08:41,860
So they're charismatic,
they're popular,

206
00:08:41,980 --> 00:08:42,813
they demonize the immigrants and the 
people with no money and no power as 

207
00:08:46,301 --> 00:08:50,800
being the problem right there over 
overly nativist are naturally strong.

208
00:08:50,801 --> 00:08:52,090
I'm military,
so he's,

209
00:08:52,150 --> 00:08:56,520
he's got all those 14 hallmark and 
misogyny is a big and fascist,

210
00:08:56,550 --> 00:08:57,390
uh,
regimes,

211
00:08:57,391 --> 00:08:58,224
right?
And in their culture and he's pushing 

212
00:08:59,461 --> 00:09:00,380
them aside,
jainism.

213
00:09:00,390 --> 00:09:01,223
Right.
And I don't know if that's a word and 

214
00:09:03,010 --> 00:09:05,220
that sounded like a word.
So it's amazing.

215
00:09:05,221 --> 00:09:06,054
So what we can say,
I'll say it here and I say it on my 

216
00:09:07,471 --> 00:09:08,310
show,
that,

217
00:09:08,311 --> 00:09:10,290
that this is what fashion that people 
go,

218
00:09:10,291 --> 00:09:11,220
well,
how did Hitler happen?

219
00:09:11,221 --> 00:09:12,750
Well,
he gave a good speech.

220
00:09:12,900 --> 00:09:13,733
He didn't have to appeal to that many 
people and that's exactly what Donald 

221
00:09:16,860 --> 00:09:17,160
Trump is.

222
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:19,740
So that really is.
So this is just a show,

223
00:09:19,741 --> 00:09:20,574
right?
Like to me this is the ultimate reality 

224
00:09:21,841 --> 00:09:23,010
show.
Is that at the end of the day,

225
00:09:23,011 --> 00:09:24,120
is that really what's happened?

226
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:26,000
Yes.
I'm sorry.

227
00:09:28,790 --> 00:09:29,623
The only thing I want to say about when 
I watched Donald Trump is the makeup 

228
00:09:32,541 --> 00:09:34,690
that he has on his face and I'm being 
completely serious.

229
00:09:34,730 --> 00:09:35,563
He's had three baby mamas.
They all are all gorgeous women that 

230
00:09:38,121 --> 00:09:38,954
know how to apply makeup and the fact 
that he doesn't turn to his wife or one 

231
00:09:42,441 --> 00:09:45,380
of the former baby mamas and go,
do you think this is too much orange?

232
00:09:45,381 --> 00:09:46,214
Too much wine under the ice says to me,
this is a person that doesn't give a 

233
00:09:48,711 --> 00:09:51,800
shit about anyone else's opinion or 
doesn't care.

234
00:09:52,010 --> 00:09:53,280
No,
I'm serious,

235
00:09:53,570 --> 00:09:55,260
really serious.
To me as,

236
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:57,560
as a,
as a silly woman that I am,

237
00:09:57,561 --> 00:09:58,394
I'm all like,
there's something wrong with that guy 

238
00:09:59,181 --> 00:10:01,220
that he can't turn to his woman and say,
what do you think?

239
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:03,590
What's going to be able to do that with 
any subject?

240
00:10:03,650 --> 00:10:05,300
He can't turn to his woman because she,
you know,

241
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:06,620
his women are anchor wives.

242
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:10,270
Last thought I'd him.
I mean,

243
00:10:10,271 --> 00:10:11,104
is there something really 
psychologically sort of void in someone 

244
00:10:14,951 --> 00:10:19,880
that's answer to everything is they love
me and I'm going to show you why

245
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:20,753
I look forward to Donald Trump's next 
speech where he called another group of 

246
00:10:23,731 --> 00:10:25,740
people rapists and then ends up with.
But they love it,

247
00:10:25,810 --> 00:10:26,800
but they love.
Yeah,

248
00:10:27,260 --> 00:10:28,070
exactly.
Um,

249
00:10:28,070 --> 00:10:29,960
alright,
so let's move on to the other one,

250
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:34,130
which the other big one,
which is Hillary and to me it seems like

251
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:34,993
Hillary is running,
I think the worst campaign probably in 

252
00:10:38,121 --> 00:10:41,630
modern history and forget the email 
thing and the,

253
00:10:41,631 --> 00:10:43,610
you know,
inaccessibility of the press.

254
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:44,713
There seems to be just no sort of joy or
humanity or sense of who she is or any 

255
00:10:49,131 --> 00:10:50,870
of that stuff.
Are you guys with me on that?

256
00:10:50,871 --> 00:10:51,704
What,
what do you think about the campaign 

257
00:10:52,791 --> 00:10:53,260
itself?

258
00:10:53,260 --> 00:10:54,430
You are correct,
Dave.

259
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:57,400
It is horrible.
She's at the beginning of the summer she

260
00:10:57,401 --> 00:10:58,234
said that,
uh,

261
00:10:58,390 --> 00:11:01,690
nobody stands up for progressive values 
a stronger than she does.

262
00:11:01,691 --> 00:11:02,740
And then just the other day she said,
Hey,

263
00:11:02,741 --> 00:11:05,200
I'm a centrist.
She's bragging that she's,

264
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:10,270
that's what's wrong with the countries 
knucklehead is that the center has moved

265
00:11:10,271 --> 00:11:12,610
to the right.
So now when you say you're a centrist,

266
00:11:12,730 --> 00:11:15,580
you're actually a Republican from the 
nineties.

267
00:11:15,610 --> 00:11:16,061
Right.
Okay.

268
00:11:16,061 --> 00:11:16,894
And that's the problem.
So that's why Bernie Sanders had such 

269
00:11:18,911 --> 00:11:21,250
traction and that's why she's doing such
a bad job.

270
00:11:21,251 --> 00:11:22,084
But I will say that the email thing,
it just goes to prove you because they 

271
00:11:25,101 --> 00:11:25,934
did,
they just came out and said that there 

272
00:11:26,831 --> 00:11:28,600
was,
if you don't commit a crime,

273
00:11:28,630 --> 00:11:29,463
it will haunt you.

274
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:31,460
Okay.
So they've said.

275
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:32,473
So I guess the State Department has said
that she actually didn't send any 

276
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:36,553
classified emails.
I don't know what to believe at this 

277
00:11:37,971 --> 00:11:38,804
point,
but to me the whole thing is sort of 

278
00:11:39,831 --> 00:11:40,664
nonsensical because one day we're just 
going to have a point where the 

279
00:11:43,881 --> 00:11:44,714
politicians just won't use email or they
won't use any electronic communication 

280
00:11:47,450 --> 00:11:50,210
and they're going to do all their bad 
shit by just talking to people.

281
00:11:50,211 --> 00:11:50,930
You know what I mean?
Like,

282
00:11:50,930 --> 00:11:53,770
so to make it about the emails itself is
sort of,

283
00:11:53,910 --> 00:11:54,850
it's,
it's the,

284
00:11:54,851 --> 00:11:56,410
uh,
it's the wound,

285
00:11:56,411 --> 00:11:58,810
not really what's,
what's the underlying problem?

286
00:11:58,910 --> 00:12:02,030
I don't think necessarily that she's 
running a terrible campaign.

287
00:12:02,060 --> 00:12:02,893
It could be a lot better.
I think when we were talking earlier in 

288
00:12:05,001 --> 00:12:07,150
the green room and you were saying,
what does she stand for?

289
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:08,713
I thought that was a great point because
no one knows what does she specifically 

290
00:12:12,231 --> 00:12:13,550
stand for.
You know what I mean?

291
00:12:13,551 --> 00:12:14,341
We know.
Yeah.

292
00:12:14,341 --> 00:12:15,570
Yeah.
But how's that Democrats?

293
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:18,050
But how is that possible?
There's one thing where you were like,

294
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:19,160
what is Hillary?
Like,

295
00:12:19,190 --> 00:12:21,280
you can't name one thing that she likes.
Right?

296
00:12:21,310 --> 00:12:22,510
So,
so I think you generally,

297
00:12:22,511 --> 00:12:23,620
you basically like her,
right?

298
00:12:23,630 --> 00:12:23,830
Like

299
00:12:23,830 --> 00:12:25,600
I do like,
and I was telling him earlier,

300
00:12:25,601 --> 00:12:26,434
I have a picture of the Gig 15 years ago
of Hillary and me and the backstage and 

301
00:12:29,921 --> 00:12:31,690
I'm like,
I just want her to be president for that

302
00:12:31,691 --> 00:12:32,524
picture.
I mean that's a funny answer to the 

303
00:12:34,541 --> 00:12:35,374
seriousness of the question.
The thing is she's had so much bad news 

304
00:12:39,100 --> 00:12:39,933
over the past two or three months on 
headlines about Bengazi all the time 

305
00:12:43,481 --> 00:12:44,314
about those emails and it's just insane 
how much people in America don't want 

306
00:12:50,950 --> 00:12:55,570
its establishment candidates.
And that's the problem with her is she's

307
00:12:55,571 --> 00:12:56,920
too establishment,
you know?

308
00:12:56,950 --> 00:13:00,370
That's why Donald Trump is doing good.
That's why Bernie Sanders is doing good.

309
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:02,530
People want something different.

310
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:04,100
Yeah.
So I want to get to Bernie in a sec,

311
00:13:04,101 --> 00:13:05,330
but I think you hit on something with 
the,

312
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:06,193
with the establishment and the media.
It seems to me that the media loves 

313
00:13:08,571 --> 00:13:10,820
trump because they,
because of what we said earlier this off

314
00:13:10,821 --> 00:13:11,654
the prompter thing,
hillary is completely scripted and I 

315
00:13:14,331 --> 00:13:15,164
also think the media is sort of digging 
the fact that Hillary has been around 

316
00:13:18,561 --> 00:13:19,394
for so long and it's,
she's always had this back and forth 

317
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:23,113
with the media and I think they love 
just attacking her that in no way as a 

318
00:13:26,361 --> 00:13:29,240
defense of her,
but how much is just that the media just

319
00:13:29,241 --> 00:13:32,840
loves a narrative and now it's like 
we're going to take down this woman.

320
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:34,940
Yes,
that is exactly what you know.

321
00:13:34,941 --> 00:13:35,510
And,
and,

322
00:13:35,510 --> 00:13:36,343
uh,
not that I want to defend Hillary 

323
00:13:38,460 --> 00:13:40,140
Clinton,
but to be,

324
00:13:40,150 --> 00:13:40,983
to,
you have to in this situation because 

325
00:13:42,451 --> 00:13:43,284
the New York Times just had like a 
fricken vendetta against her over these 

326
00:13:45,570 --> 00:13:46,770
and the law.
There was nothing.

327
00:13:46,771 --> 00:13:48,990
By the way,
you talk about email Hank Paulson,

328
00:13:49,020 --> 00:13:53,160
who was the secretary of the treasury 
when everything went belly up,

329
00:13:53,220 --> 00:13:56,790
right when the whole thing cratered,
he never even used the males.

330
00:13:56,870 --> 00:13:59,040
Right?
And that that's my booze email.

331
00:13:59,100 --> 00:14:00,660
Right?
So that's what your point is,

332
00:14:00,661 --> 00:14:01,291
is like,
well,

333
00:14:01,291 --> 00:14:02,124
let's make a bigger deal out of her 
emails and no one will put anything in 

334
00:14:04,291 --> 00:14:05,220
an email that's important.

335
00:14:05,270 --> 00:14:06,051
Right?
And by the way,

336
00:14:06,051 --> 00:14:08,180
we know that even when you lie under 
oath,

337
00:14:08,181 --> 00:14:09,530
we've talked about this a thousand 
times,

338
00:14:09,531 --> 00:14:11,920
like James Clapper,
who was the head of the CIA and they,

339
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:14,990
they asked him,
are we doing this mass data collection?

340
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:17,990
And he said not wittingly as he was 
scratching the top of his head,

341
00:14:17,991 --> 00:14:20,020
because that's where you scratch when 
you're in your lie.

342
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:22,970
So we know that even when you lie,
right,

343
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,160
like they're not going to really do 
anything.

344
00:14:25,260 --> 00:14:29,770
It makes me laugh because pottery barn 
does mass data collection mean everybody

345
00:14:29,771 --> 00:14:30,080
does.

346
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:31,880
They know what you,
what you have in your kitchen.

347
00:14:31,890 --> 00:14:33,130
They do know what I have in mind.

348
00:14:33,390 --> 00:14:34,010
Yeah.
Alright.

349
00:14:34,010 --> 00:14:34,843
So let's move on to Bernie because this 
is the one that I think we should be 

350
00:14:37,401 --> 00:14:38,234
talking about more.
And I've been trying to talk about him 

351
00:14:39,771 --> 00:14:40,610
more.
Uh,

352
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:42,710
I think he's talking about the right 
things.

353
00:14:42,711 --> 00:14:44,510
Income inequality,
which is a huge problem.

354
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:47,540
He's talking about money and politics,
which nobody's talking about.

355
00:14:47,541 --> 00:14:49,430
As I told you guys earlier,
I went to the gop debate.

356
00:14:49,580 --> 00:14:50,413
I literally think I might've been only 
person that asked anyone in that room 

357
00:14:53,811 --> 00:14:56,120
about money in politics.
I asked Scott Walker.

358
00:14:56,121 --> 00:14:58,190
He went out of the race two days later.
I mean,

359
00:14:58,310 --> 00:14:59,143
that tells you something.

360
00:14:59,790 --> 00:15:00,623
So that goes back to your earlier 
question about Donald Trump deserves 

361
00:15:03,151 --> 00:15:05,070
credit for bringing up this issue.
Yes,

362
00:15:05,071 --> 00:15:05,904
he does expose the cravenness and the 
and the emptiness of the political 

363
00:15:09,691 --> 00:15:10,560
process,
right?

364
00:15:10,561 --> 00:15:11,670
Or the,
I don't know,

365
00:15:11,671 --> 00:15:14,190
the complete corruption of the political
process,

366
00:15:14,460 --> 00:15:16,740
but then no reporter ever says,
Hey,

367
00:15:16,741 --> 00:15:19,020
what's your plan to fix that?
Nobody ever says,

368
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:19,861
hey,
that was great.

369
00:15:19,861 --> 00:15:20,694
That way.
You showed everybody how you buy all 

370
00:15:21,811 --> 00:15:23,700
these guys on stage.
What's your plan to fix that?

371
00:15:23,750 --> 00:15:24,920
Right.
And he doesn't know.

372
00:15:25,110 --> 00:15:29,370
So he's also at the same time revealing 
the corruption in the political process.

373
00:15:29,580 --> 00:15:32,040
He's revealing the corruption and the 
news media.

374
00:15:32,041 --> 00:15:32,791
Right?
So the news,

375
00:15:32,791 --> 00:15:33,624
me,
Chuck Todd had him on and he asked them 

376
00:15:34,891 --> 00:15:36,210
the Muslim question,
right?

377
00:15:36,420 --> 00:15:38,310
And he started out,
this was just Sunday,

378
00:15:38,490 --> 00:15:39,323
and he said,
uh,

379
00:15:39,450 --> 00:15:40,283
you know,
you say that you don't have to respond 

380
00:15:42,361 --> 00:15:44,370
to everybody who says something and I 
agree with you on that.

381
00:15:44,430 --> 00:15:47,550
That's how he started his question.
So he just interrupt.

382
00:15:47,551 --> 00:15:48,384
Chuck Todd just interviewed Donald Trump
after the biggest gap that you could 

383
00:15:51,451 --> 00:15:52,800
ever imagine,
right?

384
00:15:52,801 --> 00:15:54,780
Some guy says,
let's call it let's round up Muslims.

385
00:15:54,870 --> 00:15:55,703
And by the way,
the president of Muslim and trump says 

386
00:15:56,941 --> 00:15:58,800
yes to both of them.
Chuck Todd,

387
00:15:58,801 --> 00:16:00,990
the number one political reporter in 
America has them on the show,

388
00:16:00,991 --> 00:16:05,930
doesn't lay a fucking glove on them or 
you can delay.

389
00:16:06,150 --> 00:16:06,901
And then he's like,
well,

390
00:16:06,901 --> 00:16:07,734
thanks for having Donald Trump.
Says it was a pleasure and didn't know 

391
00:16:09,571 --> 00:16:11,010
what Chuck Todd says.
You Bet.

392
00:16:11,130 --> 00:16:12,390
Yeah,
that's what he said.

393
00:16:12,470 --> 00:16:15,180
So that's what's wrong with the.
And if you go,

394
00:16:15,181 --> 00:16:15,541
why?
Why,

395
00:16:15,541 --> 00:16:18,210
why do we have the biggest income 
disparities since the gilded age?

396
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:19,193
Why do we only have five major media 
corporations in America when they used 

397
00:16:21,661 --> 00:16:24,590
to be 50 and 1980?
Why can't we get the straight dope?

398
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:25,433
Why does when we nationalize the banks,
nobody calls it that and that's because 

399
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:30,720
they're all bought and paid for by the 
same people.

400
00:16:30,721 --> 00:16:31,710
Read manufacturing because.

401
00:16:32,470 --> 00:16:35,440
All right,
so I think your answer,

402
00:16:35,470 --> 00:16:37,330
the original question was what about 
Bernie?

403
00:16:37,331 --> 00:16:38,164
And I think it got there in a long way 
because he is talking about those 

404
00:16:42,521 --> 00:16:44,680
things.
So basically do you think that the media

405
00:16:44,681 --> 00:16:47,320
just has a vested interest in really not
showing him?

406
00:16:47,470 --> 00:16:48,303
So for example,
the other day a Bernie and trump were 

407
00:16:50,891 --> 00:16:55,060
both giving speeches at the same time.
And even MSNBC,

408
00:16:55,240 --> 00:16:56,530
which you'd think would be,
you know,

409
00:16:56,531 --> 00:16:59,020
they're supposed to lean forward or I 
guess they did until two months ago.

410
00:16:59,021 --> 00:17:01,120
Now I don't know that they lean 
backwards or I'm not sure,

411
00:17:01,300 --> 00:17:04,600
but even they were covering trump 
instead of covering Bernie.

412
00:17:04,601 --> 00:17:05,434
So can it.
Can an outsider like Bernie ever really 

413
00:17:06,971 --> 00:17:07,650
win

414
00:17:07,650 --> 00:17:12,650
if he is a little bit more fun?
I'm seriously the answer why people love

415
00:17:13,381 --> 00:17:16,410
trump because he's fun.
You can make fun of them.

416
00:17:16,440 --> 00:17:18,360
It doesn't hurt his feelings,
you know,

417
00:17:18,390 --> 00:17:22,240
and he is out of the box.
But when it comes to Bernie like they,

418
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:24,840
they're going to have to start putting 
him on the tonight show,

419
00:17:24,990 --> 00:17:26,610
drinking wine with a,
you know?

420
00:17:26,730 --> 00:17:27,563
Yeah.
Yeah.

421
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:29,470
Well I saw,
I did a promo.

422
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:32,320
He did a promo for the nightly show and 
he said on fleek,

423
00:17:32,530 --> 00:17:34,750
which you've ever heard Bernie Sanders 
say on fleek,

424
00:17:34,751 --> 00:17:36,290
it was actually pretty funny.
Um,

425
00:17:36,300 --> 00:17:37,133
but yes.
So how much of that is it that he's the 

426
00:17:38,351 --> 00:17:41,680
outsider guy so he should be getting the
Obama,

427
00:17:41,740 --> 00:17:44,470
the first time Obama went around,
he should be getting that excitement.

428
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:45,910
But,
but Bernie himself,

429
00:17:45,911 --> 00:17:49,210
he's a 70 something year old white guy 
from.

430
00:17:50,610 --> 00:17:53,600
He's not that exciting and sadly that 
comb,

431
00:17:54,700 --> 00:17:55,140
right?
Like,

432
00:17:55,140 --> 00:17:55,973
you should shave the sides,
but you don't really like how much is 

433
00:17:57,721 --> 00:18:01,060
just that,
that maybe his person sadly in,

434
00:18:01,061 --> 00:18:01,894
in 2015 in America that his personality 
doesn't match up in the way we want to 

435
00:18:06,421 --> 00:18:09,030
vote for somebody.
The way his rhetoric,

436
00:18:09,031 --> 00:18:10,440
which I think a lot of people agree 
with.

437
00:18:10,740 --> 00:18:12,260
You know,
it's funny that he,

438
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:13,133
he,
he's the big outsider on the left and 

439
00:18:15,590 --> 00:18:19,490
trump is the big outsider on the right.
And one of them spend zero time on their

440
00:18:19,491 --> 00:18:23,510
hair and one of them here I would like 
to ask Donald Trump,

441
00:18:23,511 --> 00:18:24,344
does he have a long form birth 
certificate for that fucking hairpiece 

442
00:18:27,110 --> 00:18:29,150
anyway,
so that thing definitely was not born in

443
00:18:29,151 --> 00:18:29,984
America.
No one thing he talked about what you 

444
00:18:31,491 --> 00:18:32,324
know.
So even even msnbc wasn't covering 

445
00:18:34,101 --> 00:18:34,820
Bernie,
right?

446
00:18:34,820 --> 00:18:35,653
Well let's.
Because Msnbc is not a liberal 

447
00:18:37,011 --> 00:18:39,350
corporation,
they're a corporation by the way,

448
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:43,250
through the whole Iraq war.
MSNBC was owned by General Electric,

449
00:18:43,251 --> 00:18:44,084
which is a huge defense contractor.
So the lefties were left getting their 

450
00:18:46,540 --> 00:18:48,990
antiwar message from a fucking defense 
contractor,

451
00:18:49,190 --> 00:18:50,023
which is why they fired,
filled down to you because he was 

452
00:18:51,111 --> 00:18:53,030
against the war and they kept grits.
Matthews.

453
00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:57,280
And then they also just fired Ed Schultz
because he's against the tpt and comcast

454
00:18:57,281 --> 00:18:59,090
is all for the dpt.
So I said,

455
00:18:59,130 --> 00:19:00,860
I already said this,
but they're not liberal.

456
00:19:00,861 --> 00:19:03,920
As soon as Rachel maddow says something 
that costs comcast's money,

457
00:19:03,980 --> 00:19:04,813
they will fire her.
And it's just an embarrassment to her 

458
00:19:06,561 --> 00:19:08,150
that they haven't.
Well,

459
00:19:08,151 --> 00:19:10,400
for the record or a has told me,
I can say anything I want.

460
00:19:10,820 --> 00:19:12,110
It's all a fencer.
That's pretty good.

461
00:19:12,111 --> 00:19:12,944
That's pretty good.
I mean it shouldn't be the fairest went 

462
00:19:13,641 --> 00:19:15,860
to them and if you watch the channel 
like I do,

463
00:19:16,010 --> 00:19:18,410
you see that they're corporatists 
they're not.

464
00:19:18,730 --> 00:19:21,680
Especially Chris Hayes.
He's couldn't be worse.

465
00:19:21,810 --> 00:19:22,261
Yeah.
All right,

466
00:19:22,261 --> 00:19:24,390
so my last thought on this is does he 
have any chance?

467
00:19:24,391 --> 00:19:25,900
Does Bernie have any chance?
My,

468
00:19:25,970 --> 00:19:27,870
my feeling is no.
Unfortunately,

469
00:19:27,871 --> 00:19:29,860
and I know people are going to give me 
shit for saying that because if they'll,

470
00:19:30,030 --> 00:19:31,500
they'll say to me,
if you say no,

471
00:19:31,620 --> 00:19:32,453
that causes people to get depressed 
about it and then they're not gonna 

472
00:19:34,411 --> 00:19:35,244
vote.
I just unfortunately I think that it's 

473
00:19:36,691 --> 00:19:40,170
very clear to me that the party is going
to not going to back him.

474
00:19:40,171 --> 00:19:41,004
They simply will not back him and that's
why people are talking about Biden 

475
00:19:44,010 --> 00:19:44,843
because I think hillary probably will 
flame out and they're gonna go with 

476
00:19:47,791 --> 00:19:48,624
Biden and it's like you guys are the big
party that hosts lot of minorities and 

477
00:19:51,901 --> 00:19:54,290
women and everything else and we're 
going to pick the VP who.

478
00:19:54,330 --> 00:19:55,440
Just another old white guy.

479
00:19:55,510 --> 00:19:56,343
Why Dante embrace Martin is because he 
is an independent and he railed so hard 

480
00:20:00,491 --> 00:20:01,630
against both Democrats.

481
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:03,650
I think they genuinely think he won't 
win.

482
00:20:03,651 --> 00:20:04,880
I think he,
they think he can't,

483
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:09,380
that are liberal for someone that far on
the left from the northeast,

484
00:20:09,381 --> 00:20:10,880
just can't win the middle of the 
country.

485
00:20:11,110 --> 00:20:12,370
Uh,
I think it bring us home.

486
00:20:12,520 --> 00:20:12,891
No,
I,

487
00:20:12,891 --> 00:20:13,724
I think the reason why the Democratic 
Party hasn't rallied around Bernie is 

488
00:20:16,841 --> 00:20:17,674
because the,
he's not in bed with the big money 

489
00:20:19,451 --> 00:20:22,720
donors.
And so they read the Democratic Party no

490
00:20:22,721 --> 00:20:25,960
longer responds to their voters.
They only respond to their donors.

491
00:20:26,170 --> 00:20:28,870
And so their donors are telling them,
get rid of this guy,

492
00:20:29,170 --> 00:20:30,970
right?
We got to get rid of that guy somehow.

493
00:20:30,971 --> 00:20:31,804
They don't want the donors want nothing 
to do with Bernie because they can't 

494
00:20:33,281 --> 00:20:35,170
control them.
Just like the donors don't want anything

495
00:20:35,171 --> 00:20:36,910
to do with Donald Trump because they 
can't control him.

496
00:20:37,090 --> 00:20:39,010
So in that sense,
they're very much alike.

497
00:20:39,011 --> 00:20:42,140
And that's exactly what's happening.
We do live in a banana republic,

498
00:20:42,150 --> 00:20:44,170
like we don't really have a responsible 
government.

499
00:20:44,171 --> 00:20:46,090
I mean,
the Sandy Hook taught us anything.

500
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:47,073
Ninety percent of the people in America 
wanted some kind of gun legislation and 

501
00:20:49,481 --> 00:20:52,480
we didn't get it.
So I'll no longer do our representatives

502
00:20:52,481 --> 00:20:53,314
represent our interests.
They only represent the donors and 

503
00:20:55,451 --> 00:20:57,910
that's why Bernie is winning.
And that's why he gets 30,000

504
00:20:57,911 --> 00:20:59,200
people when he shows up to speak.

505
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:00,980
That's how you have to segment.
All right?

506
00:21:00,981 --> 00:21:03,710
So how do you guys think we can make the
debates better?

507
00:21:03,740 --> 00:21:05,600
Because I've watched both of them,
as I said,

508
00:21:05,601 --> 00:21:07,310
I went to the last one.
Uh,

509
00:21:07,350 --> 00:21:08,183
I tweeted on the first debate that 
technically these things have not even 

510
00:21:11,271 --> 00:21:12,104
been debate.
A debate is where they present an idea 

511
00:21:14,870 --> 00:21:17,930
and then two or more people go back and 
forth on these same ideas.

512
00:21:17,931 --> 00:21:18,764
But basically what we've seen is 
moderators ask people questions catered 

513
00:21:23,001 --> 00:21:25,360
to them so that they can talk about 
their things.

514
00:21:25,361 --> 00:21:26,194
So for example,
a jake tapper would focus with Lindsey 

515
00:21:29,510 --> 00:21:31,520
Graham on foreign policy because he's a 
foreign policy guy,

516
00:21:31,521 --> 00:21:33,140
right?
That's not a debate.

517
00:21:33,141 --> 00:21:34,980
That's just sort of lobbying up 
softball.

518
00:21:34,981 --> 00:21:38,030
So what do you think we can do to make 
these things better?

519
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:38,993
I'm back to let's make it fun and 
entertaining and do it like the voice 

520
00:21:43,890 --> 00:21:45,900
comes on and you got three minutes to 
talk.

521
00:21:45,901 --> 00:21:47,100
Everyone.
Wolf Blitzer,

522
00:21:47,101 --> 00:21:47,934
they all have their back to them and as 
soon as he says one thing that they 

523
00:21:50,611 --> 00:21:52,200
like,
they turn around and he's in.

524
00:21:52,340 --> 00:21:54,410
That's actually not.
So you mask the voices,

525
00:21:54,500 --> 00:21:56,090
right?
Because otherwise they'll know.

526
00:21:56,150 --> 00:21:56,781
Oh,
that's true.

527
00:21:56,781 --> 00:21:58,880
That's just not the worst idea I've ever
heard.

528
00:21:59,090 --> 00:21:59,923
I'm just saying,

529
00:22:00,190 --> 00:22:01,023
uh,
the last debate which was on CNN was 

530
00:22:03,311 --> 00:22:04,144
fantastic because they,
instead of getting a journalist to 

531
00:22:06,611 --> 00:22:08,620
moderate it,
they hired Eddie Haskell.

532
00:22:09,970 --> 00:22:12,460
He just kept trying to forgive anybody 
to pick fights with each other.

533
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:15,760
Now Donald Trump said that you were 
ugly.

534
00:22:15,761 --> 00:22:16,594
What do you want to say to him?

535
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:19,080
So you're not jake tapper guys that what
you're telling me?

536
00:22:19,130 --> 00:22:20,140
No,
that was the,

537
00:22:20,290 --> 00:22:22,210
that was probably the worst.
By the way,

538
00:22:22,211 --> 00:22:23,360
Jake Tapper,
uh,

539
00:22:23,470 --> 00:22:24,303
he just announced that they're going to 
be start doing fact checking of 

540
00:22:26,321 --> 00:22:27,154
politicians with the factcheck.org
because apparently at cnn they don't 

541
00:22:31,211 --> 00:22:32,044
know how to do that,
so they had to hire an outside 

542
00:22:33,431 --> 00:22:37,120
organization to teach them how to fact 
check at CNN.

543
00:22:37,270 --> 00:22:38,470
Nobody,
I'm jake tapper.

544
00:22:38,471 --> 00:22:39,304
Staff really knows what they're doing.
So what that is and why there was no 

545
00:22:42,821 --> 00:22:45,670
real questions and why there was no 
followup.

546
00:22:45,730 --> 00:22:46,563
There was no candy Crowley moment at 
this debate where they corrected carly 

547
00:22:49,810 --> 00:22:50,643
Fiorina for being a crazy person and 
saying blatant lies about planned 

548
00:22:53,411 --> 00:22:54,244
parenthood.
What they reason they don't do that 

549
00:22:56,261 --> 00:22:59,350
because they don't want to alienate any 
of the viewers that like these people.

550
00:22:59,650 --> 00:23:01,060
So what they'll do is they say,
hey,

551
00:23:01,090 --> 00:23:03,160
Jeb Bush said this,
Donald Trump said that.

552
00:23:03,161 --> 00:23:04,480
What do you want to say to him?
Instead of saying,

553
00:23:04,481 --> 00:23:05,560
Hey,
the facts are this,

554
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:09,040
and you said this,
how do you don't do that?

555
00:23:09,041 --> 00:23:11,710
So they're not doing journalism.
They're doing Eddie Haskell,

556
00:23:11,740 --> 00:23:13,990
ISM and they're trying to get people to 
pick fights with each other.

557
00:23:14,030 --> 00:23:15,620
Yeah,
I do agree with you,

558
00:23:15,650 --> 00:23:16,483
but on the other hand,
that question needed to be asked to 

559
00:23:18,321 --> 00:23:19,154
Carla feared the quest,
the face thing that needed to be asked 

560
00:23:22,370 --> 00:23:23,570
about trump saying,
you know,

561
00:23:23,571 --> 00:23:25,510
calling her out on her looks or 
whatever.

562
00:23:25,511 --> 00:23:28,250
I mean,
that is so terrible that it needed to be

563
00:23:28,251 --> 00:23:28,680
at.

564
00:23:28,680 --> 00:23:29,513
So I agree with you.
It had to be addressed because it was 

565
00:23:31,021 --> 00:23:34,770
just another absurdly misogynistic thing
that trump did,

566
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:36,113
but interestingly doesn't that then get 
more of the play the next day then 

567
00:23:39,211 --> 00:23:43,860
anything that might be more important 
such as foreign policy or immigration.

568
00:23:43,861 --> 00:23:44,694
I mean really can you think of any 
headline the next day that was related 

569
00:23:47,240 --> 00:23:48,140
to policy?

570
00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:49,873
Important things,
but it's important how a person who is 

571
00:23:52,671 --> 00:23:56,450
running for president is treating the 
women of this country.

572
00:23:56,451 --> 00:23:58,160
Yeah,
that totally is as important.

573
00:23:58,161 --> 00:23:58,360
Okay.

574
00:23:58,360 --> 00:23:59,193
I totally,
and the GLP did make it clear that they 

575
00:24:01,270 --> 00:24:02,103
welcome all women into the gop.
Even the ones who make Donald Trump 

576
00:24:04,811 --> 00:24:05,644
wins.

577
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:08,033
All right,
so we haven't had a democratic debate 

578
00:24:10,681 --> 00:24:12,930
yet where you have one in a couple of 
weeks in Vegas,

579
00:24:13,010 --> 00:24:16,050
right?
As I said that about Bernie segment,

580
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:18,150
you know the Democrats were supposed to 
be the big party.

581
00:24:18,300 --> 00:24:19,800
That's what everyone says.
They're supposed to be the big party,

582
00:24:19,801 --> 00:24:22,890
but they've really only got two people 
running for all intents and purposes.

583
00:24:22,891 --> 00:24:23,790
Right?
Hillary and Bernie,

584
00:24:23,910 --> 00:24:26,400
and then there's Jim Webb and and 
o'malley.

585
00:24:26,690 --> 00:24:27,180
Well,
but,

586
00:24:27,180 --> 00:24:29,610
but it's really only two people that 
everyone's talking about.

587
00:24:29,611 --> 00:24:30,444
So should we give the Republicans a 
little credit for at least they have 20 

588
00:24:33,811 --> 00:24:34,644
clowns in there,
clown car while in the democratic clown 

589
00:24:36,601 --> 00:24:37,860
car.
There's really only two people.

590
00:24:38,220 --> 00:24:39,053
Well,
Martin O'malley did come out last week 

591
00:24:40,531 --> 00:24:42,270
with a bold proposal.
He said,

592
00:24:42,271 --> 00:24:45,120
raise the age of gun ownership to 21 
years old,

593
00:24:45,300 --> 00:24:47,220
and everybody responded by saying who 
the fuck?

594
00:24:48,850 --> 00:24:50,630
But that's my point.
You know what?

595
00:24:50,710 --> 00:24:52,510
I'm going to call us,
call something crazy here.

596
00:24:52,511 --> 00:24:55,240
I think that that guy who's polling at 
negative 60,

597
00:24:55,241 --> 00:24:56,074
that nobody knows who he is.
I think he has a little bit of a chance 

598
00:24:58,901 --> 00:24:59,734
here because I think they're all going 
to get equal footing and people are so 

599
00:25:01,721 --> 00:25:03,430
sick of Hillary on the debates.
Yeah,

600
00:25:03,431 --> 00:25:05,100
and I think I,
I think he'd bring him,

601
00:25:05,101 --> 00:25:07,930
he's a good looking,
middle aged guy and I and I think he's a

602
00:25:07,931 --> 00:25:10,390
pretty decent guy and I think people are
suddenly going to go,

603
00:25:10,391 --> 00:25:11,230
who the hell is this guy?

604
00:25:11,310 --> 00:25:14,250
The irony is that it was Howard Dean 
who,

605
00:25:14,580 --> 00:25:15,413
whose idea was to limit the number of 
democratic debates because he saw what 

606
00:25:17,881 --> 00:25:18,714
happened with all the Republican debates
last time and how they ate each other 

607
00:25:21,541 --> 00:25:22,374
and how it was just a clown show and so 
we didn't want that to happen with the 

608
00:25:25,111 --> 00:25:26,880
Democrat,
so they made them limit them,

609
00:25:27,030 --> 00:25:27,990
but now we realized,
hey,

610
00:25:27,991 --> 00:25:31,290
there's actually going to be a real 
debate now so maybe we should do more of

611
00:25:31,291 --> 00:25:35,430
these because this is just free 
advertising for the Republican Party and

612
00:25:35,431 --> 00:25:36,264
we're not getting ready for the 
Democrats and people still don't know 

613
00:25:37,681 --> 00:25:38,850
where Bernie Sanders is.

614
00:25:38,980 --> 00:25:39,970
Right?
So what can,

615
00:25:39,971 --> 00:25:43,150
what can we do?
We got the election is over a year away,

616
00:25:43,180 --> 00:25:44,013
right?
What can we do to make these debates 

617
00:25:46,750 --> 00:25:48,560
better?
Like as the people,

618
00:25:48,561 --> 00:25:51,310
like do we have to demand that they have
to be done on pbs?

619
00:25:51,311 --> 00:25:52,144
I mean they were done,
I don't know if there's going to be any 

620
00:25:52,901 --> 00:25:55,030
of this upcoming year,
but for years ago some of them were done

621
00:25:55,031 --> 00:25:56,380
at pbs.
I mean something.

622
00:25:56,381 --> 00:25:59,590
How do we get it out of the Gotcha thing
out of the.

623
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:00,850
Does carly have a wrinkle

624
00:26:01,210 --> 00:26:02,550
on a face now?
What?

625
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:03,433
The answer for that as.
I mean it is going to be interesting to 

626
00:26:05,861 --> 00:26:09,160
finally see Bernie and Hillary go at it,
you know,

627
00:26:09,161 --> 00:26:13,030
but how do you make it more interesting 
and maybe they need to have someone like

628
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:16,390
at the Oscars who did the little clips 
always beforehand.

629
00:26:16,630 --> 00:26:19,630
You know what I mean?
To billy crystal come in and write.

630
00:26:19,660 --> 00:26:22,180
I don't know or I mean what do you.

631
00:26:23,310 --> 00:26:24,143
It used to be that the League of women 
voters used to organize the baits and 

632
00:26:26,731 --> 00:26:29,670
other people use it and then they got 
smart and they were like,

633
00:26:29,671 --> 00:26:31,950
hey,
we can't let other people choose.

634
00:26:31,951 --> 00:26:33,960
The people are going to ask us 
questions.

635
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:34,913
We want to control everything.
So they created this presidential 

636
00:26:38,191 --> 00:26:41,460
commission on debates and now so now 
there isn't any more.

637
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:44,250
We League of women,
so it's all controlling everything,

638
00:26:44,251 --> 00:26:45,440
which is why they suck,
right?

639
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:46,313
So somebody has to stand up like maybe 
women or some other big organizations 

640
00:26:50,550 --> 00:26:50,851
say,
hey,

641
00:26:50,851 --> 00:26:51,684
we want to have our own debate,
like the Naacp members saying we're 

642
00:26:54,241 --> 00:26:55,074
going to have our own debate at our 
thing and we were inviting people and 

643
00:26:57,331 --> 00:26:58,980
then it'll be telling who doesn't show 
up.

644
00:26:59,010 --> 00:27:00,530
Right.
So that's the way they should do it.

645
00:27:00,610 --> 00:27:01,443
Unfortunately we know that the parties,
the parties won't back that they will 

646
00:27:04,250 --> 00:27:06,340
because they have.
But Bernie Sanders is show up.

647
00:27:06,650 --> 00:27:08,320
He'll show up and he'll do it a little 
bit.

648
00:27:08,321 --> 00:27:09,154
Maybe that would be good.
Alright.

649
00:27:09,190 --> 00:27:10,023
So let's move on to what I think was the
big elephant in the room or 

650
00:27:12,251 --> 00:27:13,660
unfortunately not.
Come on.

651
00:27:14,230 --> 00:27:16,480
Jimmy Dore,
a giant of it.

652
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:19,160
The money in politics thing.
It is,

653
00:27:19,510 --> 00:27:20,343
seems pretty obvious to me that we have 
a couple like real issues in America 

654
00:27:23,621 --> 00:27:24,454
right now.
The money in politics that's ruined our 

655
00:27:25,271 --> 00:27:26,800
political system.
We've got,

656
00:27:26,820 --> 00:27:29,020
you know,
political correctness run amok,

657
00:27:29,050 --> 00:27:31,990
but nobody talked about money in 
politics.

658
00:27:31,991 --> 00:27:32,824
As I said before,
I think I might've been the only person 

659
00:27:33,671 --> 00:27:37,180
to ask them a question on this.
Why do we not talk?

660
00:27:37,181 --> 00:27:41,050
We did talk about it wasn't near Mccain 
Feingold thing 10 years ago.

661
00:27:41,110 --> 00:27:43,630
We used to sorta talk about it every now
and again.

662
00:27:43,631 --> 00:27:45,030
Nobody talks about it now.
Right?

663
00:27:45,150 --> 00:27:45,983
Talk about it.
I don't understand how we allow people 

664
00:27:48,511 --> 00:27:49,344
to run for president as a candidate when
they still owe money from the last time 

665
00:27:53,041 --> 00:27:53,874
they tried.

666
00:27:55,420 --> 00:27:56,253
Literally.
I think Hillary might be in debt still 

667
00:27:57,521 --> 00:27:58,570
from the previous thing.

668
00:27:58,660 --> 00:28:01,360
If you owe money from the last time you 
didn't get elected done,

669
00:28:01,361 --> 00:28:03,580
you can't run this time until you've 
paid everybody off.

670
00:28:03,820 --> 00:28:08,710
It is striking in outrageous at people 
don't mention it or talk about it.

671
00:28:08,711 --> 00:28:10,470
I think it's terrible.
I mean it's.

672
00:28:10,540 --> 00:28:12,100
That's the only answer.
I mean,

673
00:28:12,101 --> 00:28:13,810
what,
how do you fix that though?

674
00:28:13,870 --> 00:28:14,890
How do you fix that?

675
00:28:14,990 --> 00:28:15,823
Well,
I did notice that when I asked some of 

676
00:28:16,761 --> 00:28:19,250
the campaign people this and even when I
asked Scott Walker,

677
00:28:19,610 --> 00:28:20,443
they just,
they just link a couple of words to get 

678
00:28:21,921 --> 00:28:22,754
there to put it,
to make a sentence and then you move on 

679
00:28:24,350 --> 00:28:25,183
because they know they're not going to 
be asked this and they know no one 

680
00:28:26,991 --> 00:28:27,824
cares.
That's what I really realized that when 

681
00:28:29,121 --> 00:28:31,010
I asked them that there was a sense of 
that,

682
00:28:31,070 --> 00:28:33,740
that stupid question like nobody cares 
about that.

683
00:28:33,741 --> 00:28:35,540
Asked me the.
Asked me that question,

684
00:28:35,780 --> 00:28:36,440
you know,
so,

685
00:28:36,440 --> 00:28:37,850
so what do we do about that?

686
00:28:38,790 --> 00:28:41,730
You know,
we a wolf-pack.com,

687
00:28:41,790 --> 00:28:42,850
Dave.
That's how we,

688
00:28:43,020 --> 00:28:43,853
there's a bunch of orders.
That's the organization I'm a part of 

689
00:28:45,361 --> 00:28:46,194
that helps get money out of politics and
what you have to do is you have to pass 

690
00:28:49,380 --> 00:28:53,340
a constitutional amendment right to get 
money out of politics.

691
00:28:53,341 --> 00:28:54,180
Hillary Clinton,
by the way,

692
00:28:54,181 --> 00:28:56,910
you said she's in favor of it,
so we don't.

693
00:28:57,210 --> 00:28:57,871
I will.
That'll be,

694
00:28:57,871 --> 00:28:59,040
that's good to hear.
Also,

695
00:28:59,041 --> 00:28:59,874
the Senate also in the United States 
Congress also passed a resolution to 

696
00:29:02,731 --> 00:29:04,410
open debate on this.
So that's a good thing.

697
00:29:04,560 --> 00:29:07,440
And three states has since we've been 
trying to push this,

698
00:29:07,441 --> 00:29:10,020
I've already passed the California being
one of them,

699
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:12,500
Illinois and I think we have a New 
Hampshire,

700
00:29:12,510 --> 00:29:13,730
Vermont.
Uh,

701
00:29:13,740 --> 00:29:17,220
so that's what you need to do.
You need to get the states,

702
00:29:17,221 --> 00:29:18,054
you have to go at the state level.
They have much less controlled for 

703
00:29:20,071 --> 00:29:21,930
whatever reason on the state capital.
Sure.

704
00:29:21,990 --> 00:29:24,450
So we can make an.
So that's my big solution.

705
00:29:24,451 --> 00:29:26,430
We have to get money and you can't fix 
anything.

706
00:29:26,670 --> 00:29:28,380
Why are we still debate in climate 
change?

707
00:29:28,381 --> 00:29:29,690
Because big money,
right?

708
00:29:29,820 --> 00:29:34,160
Why are we still debating?
Should we drill in the Arctic because of

709
00:29:34,161 --> 00:29:35,050
big money?
I.

710
00:29:35,150 --> 00:29:38,790
Why are we still bombing nonstop for 30 
years in the middle of the big money?

711
00:29:38,860 --> 00:29:41,290
So is that.
So that's really the crux of that.

712
00:29:41,291 --> 00:29:42,124
The reason we can't get the public to be
ginned up enough to care is because 

713
00:29:46,481 --> 00:29:47,314
they're getting their information from 
the very people who are paying for the 

714
00:29:51,221 --> 00:29:52,960
operation to keep them dumb.

715
00:29:52,980 --> 00:29:55,890
The criminals bought the watchdog,
right?

716
00:29:55,891 --> 00:29:56,724
The watch dog used to be a,
the Walter cronkite and 60 minutes and 

717
00:30:00,481 --> 00:30:01,500
then they got smart and I said,
hey,

718
00:30:01,501 --> 00:30:04,680
let's just buy them.
And they bought them and so now the guys

719
00:30:04,681 --> 00:30:07,650
who are working for the people are 
supposed to be exposing,

720
00:30:07,860 --> 00:30:09,360
so that's why they are literally 
working.

721
00:30:09,370 --> 00:30:10,171
So that's how you go,
well,

722
00:30:10,171 --> 00:30:11,004
how do we,
how do we get it into a rack war that 

723
00:30:12,220 --> 00:30:14,400
lasted?
That's how you get it because the people

724
00:30:14,490 --> 00:30:15,323
are working for the defense contractors.
They're supposed to be exposing defense 

725
00:30:17,491 --> 00:30:19,110
contractors and they're not.
That's what,

726
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:20,433
yeah,
there's a reality where it will ever 

727
00:30:21,491 --> 00:30:22,324
turn around.

728
00:30:22,810 --> 00:30:23,770
Uh,
yes.

729
00:30:23,771 --> 00:30:26,420
I think if we get money out of politics.
And so.

730
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:27,970
So it happened before,
right?

731
00:30:27,971 --> 00:30:31,390
So Teddy Roosevelt came along and he did
the antitrust legislation,

732
00:30:31,391 --> 00:30:32,224
right?
They used to call them trust back then 

733
00:30:33,130 --> 00:30:34,540
because they would take.
Anyway,

734
00:30:34,780 --> 00:30:36,580
that was the.
So now that's what we need.

735
00:30:36,581 --> 00:30:40,180
We need him and then we need FDR.
FDR stood up and said,

736
00:30:40,181 --> 00:30:42,590
never before in the history of America 
has the money.

737
00:30:42,591 --> 00:30:45,310
People have been more organized in their
hatred for one candidate,

738
00:30:45,430 --> 00:30:47,400
and I welcome their hatred.
Could you imagine,

739
00:30:47,570 --> 00:30:49,430
can you imagine anyone,
anyone saying that today?

740
00:30:49,431 --> 00:30:50,610
Besides Bernie Sanders?
Right?

741
00:30:50,630 --> 00:30:51,463
So you,
I had a little inspiration from you 

742
00:30:52,941 --> 00:30:54,440
first because it sounded like it could 
happen,

743
00:30:54,441 --> 00:30:55,580
but then I just thought,
well,

744
00:30:55,581 --> 00:30:58,700
if we get hillary is president or let's 
say we get Jeb Bush.

745
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:00,620
Pretty sure they're not making that 
speech.

746
00:31:00,680 --> 00:31:02,120
I think we're going to have a 
revolution.

747
00:31:02,150 --> 00:31:03,740
If that happens,
we may.

748
00:31:03,741 --> 00:31:05,090
Well never have.
I'm going to buy a gun.

749
00:31:05,140 --> 00:31:05,751
Yeah.
All right.

750
00:31:05,751 --> 00:31:06,584
So let's,
uh,

751
00:31:06,890 --> 00:31:09,260
let's talk about religion and politics 
because then,

752
00:31:09,290 --> 00:31:13,340
because that's the other big one.
And look a Guy Mike Huckabee's up there.

753
00:31:13,341 --> 00:31:14,174
This is a guy that the week before was 
defending Kim Davis and everyone knows 

754
00:31:17,781 --> 00:31:22,310
about Kim Davis and not giving the 
marriage licenses to gay people.

755
00:31:22,311 --> 00:31:25,820
And Mike Huckabee actually defended her 
by saying you shouldn't,

756
00:31:26,510 --> 00:31:27,670
you shouldn't,
you know,

757
00:31:27,680 --> 00:31:29,840
partake in the law that you don't 
believe is moral.

758
00:31:30,020 --> 00:31:34,310
That is the most ridiculous anti 
American thing you could possibly do.

759
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:37,100
It shows that profound lack of 
understanding of how government works.

760
00:31:37,101 --> 00:31:38,810
At our constitution and all that.
So,

761
00:31:38,811 --> 00:31:39,890
but there's,
there's him,

762
00:31:40,100 --> 00:31:43,270
there's crews,
there's Santorum and these guys.

763
00:31:43,310 --> 00:31:48,310
And even now a Ben Carson,
what do we do about this conversation?

764
00:31:49,370 --> 00:31:52,370
Religion should have nothing.
We have separation of church and state.

765
00:31:52,400 --> 00:31:53,440
I think.
What,

766
00:31:53,550 --> 00:31:54,810
what do we do about it?

767
00:31:55,350 --> 00:31:57,840
Well,
I was googling this topic matter earlier

768
00:31:58,170 --> 00:32:02,610
and I saw that the boy scouts don't 
allow atheists in the boy scouts.

769
00:32:02,611 --> 00:32:03,444
Right?
And I was thinking it's people don't 

770
00:32:06,390 --> 00:32:07,223
want to trust other people who aren't 
religious or can pretend to be 

771
00:32:11,641 --> 00:32:13,170
religious,
you know,

772
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:15,960
with decisions that are going to impact 
them.

773
00:32:16,770 --> 00:32:19,800
I kind of get it.
But on the other hand,

774
00:32:20,310 --> 00:32:23,790
have you ever been around?
I have aunts that are so religious,

775
00:32:23,870 --> 00:32:25,480
they are evil,
you know?

776
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:28,350
Has there ever been around people like 
that,

777
00:32:28,680 --> 00:32:29,310
you know?
Uh,

778
00:32:29,310 --> 00:32:30,980
I went to Catholic school,
right?

779
00:32:31,160 --> 00:32:34,140
That's what you and,
and when I look at the Republican,

780
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:36,180
a spectrum out there,
the candidates,

781
00:32:36,181 --> 00:32:37,710
I'm like,
oh my God,

782
00:32:38,100 --> 00:32:40,580
these people evil.
I mean,

783
00:32:40,760 --> 00:32:41,593
if,
if you have blinders like this about 

784
00:32:44,990 --> 00:32:49,700
religious and how everyone has to follow
the same religion or the same thing that

785
00:32:49,701 --> 00:32:50,534
you're doing,
I mean that is just as bad as someone 

786
00:32:54,051 --> 00:32:56,270
who has a void of it and I know that

787
00:32:56,320 --> 00:33:01,320
just as bad as those horrible,
a secular values.

788
00:33:01,921 --> 00:33:03,480
I know.
It's just as equally horrible.

789
00:33:03,550 --> 00:33:04,261
Wow.
What is this?

790
00:33:04,261 --> 00:33:05,094
Is this the irony of.
Is this the irony of Republicans that 

791
00:33:08,671 --> 00:33:10,770
they say they want small government,
right?

792
00:33:10,771 --> 00:33:11,604
Yes.
They say they want some other way and 

793
00:33:12,211 --> 00:33:14,960
then at the same time they keep jamming.
[inaudible] everyone.

794
00:33:15,030 --> 00:33:16,520
I didn't live those notes.

795
00:33:16,780 --> 00:33:18,400
Yeah,
because you said your question is how do

796
00:33:18,401 --> 00:33:21,340
we get religion out of government in my 
whole thing is they should be made to go

797
00:33:21,341 --> 00:33:22,174
to an religious.
People should have to take an irony 

798
00:33:23,501 --> 00:33:24,730
class.
Right?

799
00:33:24,780 --> 00:33:25,180
Right.
Yep.

800
00:33:25,180 --> 00:33:27,490
Kim Davis,
who's thrice divorced,

801
00:33:27,670 --> 00:33:30,610
making a religious stand for the 
sanctity of marriage,

802
00:33:30,910 --> 00:33:31,930
that's,
you know,

803
00:33:31,931 --> 00:33:32,764
and,
and now the oath keepers have promised 

804
00:33:35,021 --> 00:33:37,840
to defend her and they don't want to 
lock her up again.

805
00:33:38,120 --> 00:33:38,953
She's so grateful.
She promised to marry three or four of 

806
00:33:40,331 --> 00:33:41,740
them.
So.

807
00:33:41,950 --> 00:33:42,783
And then they played that song right 
through it with a tiger and so when she 

808
00:33:45,881 --> 00:33:46,714
came out and she and she got in trouble 
for that because they didn't want her 

809
00:33:48,821 --> 00:33:50,320
to.
Survivor doesn't want to use that song.

810
00:33:50,500 --> 00:33:52,450
But she said she liked that song so 
much.

811
00:33:52,570 --> 00:33:54,070
She's going to play it at our next three
weddings.

812
00:33:54,071 --> 00:33:54,904
The point is day.

813
00:33:54,940 --> 00:33:59,100
I have a lot of these jokes.
She ruined rocky for me.

814
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:01,860
It's just so.
But what about Huckabee?

815
00:34:01,861 --> 00:34:04,100
So someone like Huckabee,
who's supposedly like,

816
00:34:04,190 --> 00:34:05,023
to me this is,
this is proof that he's not running for 

817
00:34:06,391 --> 00:34:09,510
president and he's running to run the 
Christian,

818
00:34:09,511 --> 00:34:10,321
right?
Yes.

819
00:34:10,321 --> 00:34:12,310
He.
And I wish people would just say that as

820
00:34:12,311 --> 00:34:14,070
I wish almost he could say that and he 
could say,

821
00:34:14,100 --> 00:34:14,933
you know what,
I'm up on this stage because I do 

822
00:34:16,801 --> 00:34:17,634
control or at least want to control a 
portion of this country and I want to 

823
00:34:21,331 --> 00:34:23,940
keep controlling it.
And then we can be honest about it.

824
00:34:23,941 --> 00:34:25,350
And then he would disappear when he 
gets,

825
00:34:26,010 --> 00:34:26,843
when the is go further.
But he's not really running for 

826
00:34:28,951 --> 00:34:29,611
president.
Right?

827
00:34:29,611 --> 00:34:32,370
Isn't he running his own?
That degree of power?

828
00:34:32,510 --> 00:34:34,730
I think you're very perceptive.
Dave Bliss is.

829
00:34:34,731 --> 00:34:38,030
I think why you have your own show once 
in a while and yes,

830
00:34:38,031 --> 00:34:41,030
that is exactly what he's doing.
He's running to get speaking fees.

831
00:34:41,031 --> 00:34:43,470
He's running to be the biggest Christian
onstage.

832
00:34:43,610 --> 00:34:46,700
So non whoever does become president.
He's like the Billy Graham.

833
00:34:46,701 --> 00:34:47,534
They have to come through him to get to 
the religious right that they're going 

834
00:34:49,111 --> 00:34:50,570
to need.
So it's all that.

835
00:34:50,571 --> 00:34:51,404
He's the biggest charlatan of all of 
them because at least Donald Trump who 

836
00:34:54,531 --> 00:34:55,364
is a big asshole won't take that extra 
step of putting the cross on his sleeve 

837
00:35:00,711 --> 00:35:01,544
like,
like a pocket he was and how it can be 

838
00:35:02,631 --> 00:35:03,770
as complete phony.

839
00:35:03,830 --> 00:35:04,670
Right?
And trump.

840
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:06,560
Not that I ever wanted to defend trump,
but you know,

841
00:35:06,561 --> 00:35:08,240
they asked trump about the gay marriage 
thing and he said,

842
00:35:08,241 --> 00:35:09,650
look,
the Supreme Court made a decision.

843
00:35:09,651 --> 00:35:10,484
I,
I would have to abide by the Supreme 

844
00:35:12,110 --> 00:35:13,670
Court.
That shows a better understanding of how

845
00:35:13,671 --> 00:35:17,110
government works.
Then Santorum or Huckabee,

846
00:35:17,150 --> 00:35:20,210
who want you to just pick which laws can
you imagine if we could all just pick.

847
00:35:20,330 --> 00:35:21,830
Well,
I'm not going to pay taxes morally.

848
00:35:21,831 --> 00:35:22,580
I don't think I should have.
Yeah,

849
00:35:22,580 --> 00:35:23,720
yeah.
Separate but equal.

850
00:35:23,721 --> 00:35:25,070
So that means we can just ignore it.
No,

851
00:35:25,080 --> 00:35:26,530
that's not that sounds right.

852
00:35:26,660 --> 00:35:27,493
But I do like what you're saying about 
he's running to get a speaking 

853
00:35:30,111 --> 00:35:30,944
engagement,
but then the reality is how much money 

854
00:35:33,801 --> 00:35:34,634
is he spending to try to run for 
president versus how much you would 

855
00:35:37,080 --> 00:35:38,350
actually ever make

856
00:35:38,460 --> 00:35:40,740
as a space spending his own money.
Right?

857
00:35:40,830 --> 00:35:41,730
So he's not.
Yeah,

858
00:35:42,760 --> 00:35:43,593
it's not his.
And ultimately it's not about the 

859
00:35:44,851 --> 00:35:45,684
speaking money per se,
as much as just the influence that he 

860
00:35:47,611 --> 00:35:49,740
will just run the Christian,
right?

861
00:35:49,741 --> 00:35:51,090
Like be the next billy Graham or 
somebody.

862
00:35:51,210 --> 00:35:53,140
But I want to backup the saying that you
said early about this,

863
00:35:53,190 --> 00:35:54,023
this atheist thing,
because the first two episodes of the 

864
00:35:55,681 --> 00:35:56,514
show we had Sam Harris,
who's probably the most outspoken 

865
00:35:58,160 --> 00:36:02,900
atheist and Carrie Santa Maria.
Uh,

866
00:36:02,910 --> 00:36:05,400
also an atheist.
And we talked a little bit about,

867
00:36:05,580 --> 00:36:06,413
I'm atheist and politics and every poll 
shows that people would never vote for 

868
00:36:09,421 --> 00:36:11,250
an atheist.
People hate atheist.

869
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:12,353
Why are we so afraid of secularism?
I think this is sort of what you were 

870
00:36:14,311 --> 00:36:17,250
saying before.
Why are we afraid of people that would,

871
00:36:17,310 --> 00:36:22,310
that would base their decisions on the 
law of the land and not the imaginary.

872
00:36:22,820 --> 00:36:26,100
I think it's because everyone has this 
like ultimate fantasy of the.

873
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:29,460
You get to be president.
Something terrible goes down somewhere.

874
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:31,800
He has his finger on the button,
right?

875
00:36:32,010 --> 00:36:33,540
Like what?
What's going to happen?

876
00:36:33,541 --> 00:36:34,374
You want to know that your president is 
going to be in that dark space in his 

877
00:36:36,991 --> 00:36:39,090
room before he asked to make some 
terrible decision like,

878
00:36:39,091 --> 00:36:39,924
dear God,
you want the comfort of knowing it's a 

879
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:43,860
whole facade.
It's a fake,

880
00:36:43,861 --> 00:36:45,810
but you don't want that.
You know what I mean?

881
00:36:45,811 --> 00:36:48,150
You don't want someone that's just like 
this is the line,

882
00:36:48,151 --> 00:36:50,160
the column of good things that'll 
happen.

883
00:36:50,161 --> 00:36:51,990
This is the column of bad things I 
think,

884
00:36:51,991 --> 00:36:55,980
because people want to be able to hang 
hope on a president and,

885
00:36:55,990 --> 00:36:59,420
and as weird as it sounds,
I think what he is,

886
00:36:59,430 --> 00:37:00,410
you don't hang on.

887
00:37:00,910 --> 00:37:04,000
Sorry,
I'm sorry for the fact that I think it's

888
00:37:04,001 --> 00:37:06,260
the same thing with gay people.
Uh,

889
00:37:06,310 --> 00:37:07,143
people were against gay marriage until 
they knew a gay person and I think 

890
00:37:11,621 --> 00:37:13,990
people are afraid of atheists until they
known atheist.

891
00:37:14,170 --> 00:37:16,030
I was against gay marriage to like 
hockey married.

892
00:37:16,360 --> 00:37:18,050
I'm now,
I'm okay there.

893
00:37:19,080 --> 00:37:20,740
But um,
what do you think about it?

894
00:37:20,770 --> 00:37:21,760
That's what I really think it is.
Yeah.

895
00:37:21,840 --> 00:37:23,890
People just don't know atheists and they
think,

896
00:37:23,891 --> 00:37:24,724
well,
they're dying.

897
00:37:25,340 --> 00:37:26,173
In fact,
they kind of be quitting with devil 

898
00:37:26,801 --> 00:37:28,190
worshipers know.
It's like,

899
00:37:28,280 --> 00:37:30,030
no,
there are no worshiping nothing,

900
00:37:30,220 --> 00:37:32,330
which is exactly why I've been saying on
the show repeatedly.

901
00:37:32,340 --> 00:37:33,850
Yeah,
the atheist have to come out.

902
00:37:34,030 --> 00:37:35,770
I think the atheist movement should do 
that.

903
00:37:35,800 --> 00:37:38,890
The most important thing that gay people
ever did was come out.

904
00:37:38,891 --> 00:37:40,510
And I think that that's what's next for 
atheism.

905
00:37:40,511 --> 00:37:42,430
Maybe we should start calling ourselves 
something else.

906
00:37:42,430 --> 00:37:44,280
Like,
I like the term non theist.

907
00:37:44,380 --> 00:37:45,430
Yeah,
I like that.

908
00:37:45,431 --> 00:37:46,470
It sounds better.
It doesn't.

909
00:37:46,490 --> 00:37:48,280
It's like I'm not into the shift.
Right,

910
00:37:48,281 --> 00:37:49,114
but don't you hate that you even have to
associate with the term doesn't that in 

911
00:37:51,311 --> 00:37:52,810
itself,
it's like then you're in the club,

912
00:37:53,290 --> 00:37:54,760
what club would,
why me kind of thing.

913
00:37:54,820 --> 00:37:55,840
Yes and that.
Yes,

914
00:37:55,841 --> 00:38:00,010
and I don't agree that there is such a 
thing as militant atheism.

915
00:38:00,340 --> 00:38:01,300
I don't,
I don't agree.

916
00:38:01,390 --> 00:38:04,090
That's like saying you're a militant,
logical person.

917
00:38:05,220 --> 00:38:08,380
I will apply logic to every situation.
You know,

918
00:38:08,381 --> 00:38:12,160
all these atheists that are getting 
rallies together to hurt people.

919
00:38:12,161 --> 00:38:13,450
It's just not happening.
Not.

920
00:38:13,560 --> 00:38:14,393
All right,
well that's a perfect segue to the next 

921
00:38:15,341 --> 00:38:16,174
thing I want to talk about,
which is the PC culture that we seem to 

922
00:38:17,411 --> 00:38:18,880
live in.
So I have two comedians.

923
00:38:19,210 --> 00:38:21,790
This is our job more than anything else 
is to,

924
00:38:21,820 --> 00:38:24,910
is to get to that line and figure out 
where it is and push it.

925
00:38:24,911 --> 00:38:25,744
Maybe cross it every now and again.
I think we live in a very bizarre time 

926
00:38:28,511 --> 00:38:29,344
where we have trigger warnings now in 
these social justice warriors and every 

927
00:38:33,491 --> 00:38:37,300
time anyone says anything,
you say something about women they don't

928
00:38:37,301 --> 00:38:38,100
like,
they they.

929
00:38:38,100 --> 00:38:39,220
You're now,
you hate women.

930
00:38:39,430 --> 00:38:43,210
You say something about any minority you
don't like or you say anything about gay

931
00:38:43,211 --> 00:38:45,040
people.
You automatically hate all of them.

932
00:38:45,250 --> 00:38:46,083
That we automatically jumped to the 
conclusion that it's based in racism or 

933
00:38:49,331 --> 00:38:52,570
xenophobia.
Especially for Comedians.

934
00:38:52,571 --> 00:38:54,640
This is a seriously dangerous slope,
right?

935
00:38:54,980 --> 00:38:57,440
He knows the worst with that.
The Puerto Ricans.

936
00:39:02,700 --> 00:39:03,580
Yeah.
Yeah.

937
00:39:03,600 --> 00:39:03,830
Yeah.

938
00:39:03,830 --> 00:39:05,720
I don't think it's so much about pc 
culture.

939
00:39:05,721 --> 00:39:08,180
I just think everyone has a knee jerk 
reaction.

940
00:39:08,181 --> 00:39:10,610
People are like this now.
Why are people like this now?

941
00:39:10,611 --> 00:39:11,444
Everyone is so angry and no one just 
wants to enjoy jokes or have fun 

942
00:39:15,381 --> 00:39:16,011
anymore.
Every.

943
00:39:16,011 --> 00:39:16,844
Everything has to be a purpose.
Like now they have the new normal 

944
00:39:18,801 --> 00:39:19,634
Barbie.
It's a Barbie doll that has stretch 

945
00:39:21,101 --> 00:39:25,290
marks and pimples,
unnormal Barbie and I just,

946
00:39:25,870 --> 00:39:26,703
you know,
why can't people just have toys and not 

947
00:39:28,090 --> 00:39:28,923
reading a million things?
Why does everything have to have a 100 

948
00:39:31,821 --> 00:39:36,150
percent purpose or you know what I mean?
Be without any humor or anything.

949
00:39:36,410 --> 00:39:37,243
Do you think that that actually takes 
something very special away from 

950
00:39:40,401 --> 00:39:41,980
childhood that,
you know,

951
00:39:42,020 --> 00:39:45,500
I played with Gi Joe or human or 
transformers and the imagination,

952
00:39:45,620 --> 00:39:49,190
I've got to use my imagination to make 
up this world and you know,

953
00:39:49,310 --> 00:39:51,770
figure out things that I thought and 
whatever,

954
00:39:51,950 --> 00:39:52,783
where now you're going to make 
everything so realistic for these kids 

955
00:39:54,621 --> 00:39:58,910
and have them have every fear and 
everything that might upset them,

956
00:39:59,060 --> 00:40:00,650
but you're going to send a bunch of 
robots and by the way,

957
00:40:00,651 --> 00:40:01,401
they're drugged,
right?

958
00:40:01,401 --> 00:40:03,380
They're all on every drug known to man 
because of,

959
00:40:04,090 --> 00:40:05,120
you know,
whatever,

960
00:40:05,240 --> 00:40:07,820
that we're going to send them out into a
world drugged and afraid of everything.

961
00:40:07,821 --> 00:40:09,260
That's pretty dangerous combination.
Right.

962
00:40:09,930 --> 00:40:11,840
You know,
giving back to the PC thing,

963
00:40:11,841 --> 00:40:12,674
you are correct that some,
some people are to knee jerk and cry a 

964
00:40:17,720 --> 00:40:20,510
racism or whatever,
antisemitism.

965
00:40:20,570 --> 00:40:23,420
But there are,
there is racism and there is.

966
00:40:23,421 --> 00:40:25,970
So that's the thing.
That's where it's like murky right here,

967
00:40:25,971 --> 00:40:26,804
like,
well I don't want to get into a point 

968
00:40:28,191 --> 00:40:29,024
where we just shout so now because the 
right wing does a thing where they shop 

969
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:33,320
every time there actually is racism.
They go,

970
00:40:33,321 --> 00:40:34,790
oh,
you're just too PC.

971
00:40:34,970 --> 00:40:36,530
No,
that's not being too pc.

972
00:40:36,650 --> 00:40:37,483
Right.
So that,

973
00:40:37,490 --> 00:40:38,323
for example,
that would be when the right will say 

974
00:40:39,381 --> 00:40:41,990
that Christians are actually the most 
under attack in America,

975
00:40:42,570 --> 00:40:43,403
which is of course completely or the 
Christian is going to have their day in 

976
00:40:46,851 --> 00:40:47,720
America,
Dave,

977
00:40:47,960 --> 00:40:51,560
someday they're going to have a guy 
maybe in the White House to run things.

978
00:40:51,561 --> 00:40:53,040
So yes.
You know,

979
00:40:53,041 --> 00:40:55,370
the thing that Jerry Seinfeld rights for
that came up with,

980
00:40:55,371 --> 00:40:57,980
he was complaining about pc culture on 
campus.

981
00:40:58,220 --> 00:41:01,580
I haven't in colleges in a year but I 
mean in a couple of years,

982
00:41:01,581 --> 00:41:04,970
but I noticed when I used to play 
colleges that the higher their tuition,

983
00:41:04,971 --> 00:41:06,920
the more freedom I got to say whatever I
wanted.

984
00:41:07,340 --> 00:41:08,660
And it was interesting.
Yeah.

985
00:41:08,661 --> 00:41:10,070
The,
so the lower the tuition,

986
00:41:10,100 --> 00:41:10,933
you know,
I don't know if the DM or the kids or 

987
00:41:11,661 --> 00:41:12,620
whatever.
I don't know.

988
00:41:12,830 --> 00:41:14,690
I went to a shoe that's very politically
incorrect.

989
00:41:14,691 --> 00:41:16,010
Yeah,
I know that's politically incorrect.

990
00:41:16,011 --> 00:41:19,660
So I went to a suny school and I'm a 
dumb guy so I can say that and uh,

991
00:41:19,700 --> 00:41:21,250
uh,
don't look up where I went.

992
00:41:22,670 --> 00:41:25,430
Went to jail.
The point is it sucked.

993
00:41:25,431 --> 00:41:26,680
George Bush went there.
Well,

994
00:41:26,720 --> 00:41:27,790
that whole thing.
Trigger war.

995
00:41:27,850 --> 00:41:28,683
Yes,
it's,

996
00:41:28,980 --> 00:41:30,250
I,
when I first for,

997
00:41:30,280 --> 00:41:31,113
of course dancer,
there's going to be someone who reads 

998
00:41:32,511 --> 00:41:34,220
something and it's going to fuck them 
up.

999
00:41:34,670 --> 00:41:36,850
Will you can't pass a law about it,
you know,

1000
00:41:37,040 --> 00:41:38,810
that's their own problem they have to 
deal with.

1001
00:41:38,811 --> 00:41:40,400
Do you know when I hear what I hear a 
car horns,

1002
00:41:40,401 --> 00:41:41,234
I freak out.
I can't pass a law that says nobody can 

1003
00:41:43,041 --> 00:41:43,940
beat their horn anymore.

1004
00:41:43,980 --> 00:41:45,570
Right?
So is the bigger fear.

1005
00:41:45,780 --> 00:41:48,930
I used to fear that the first amendment 
would disappear,

1006
00:41:48,931 --> 00:41:50,760
that the government would take our free 
speech.

1007
00:41:50,761 --> 00:41:51,594
But what I'm starting to fear now,
although I am no big fan of the 

1008
00:41:53,701 --> 00:41:54,534
government in any capacity,
what I'm starting to fear now is that 

1009
00:41:56,460 --> 00:41:59,190
ultimately we're just going to take our 
freedoms away.

1010
00:41:59,191 --> 00:42:00,024
We're going to get so afraid of saying 
anything and I see this happen all the 

1011
00:42:02,401 --> 00:42:03,930
time.
Now I get emails,

1012
00:42:04,140 --> 00:42:06,360
not that I'm the most politically 
incorrect person there is,

1013
00:42:06,361 --> 00:42:07,194
but I get emails now.
People saying that I'm saying things 

1014
00:42:08,731 --> 00:42:09,564
that they wish they could say and it 
seems to me that people are censoring 

1015
00:42:12,721 --> 00:42:13,554
themselves already,
so I fear that I fear the self 

1016
00:42:15,721 --> 00:42:16,554
censorship because of all this more than
I fear that the government's going to 

1017
00:42:20,641 --> 00:42:22,470
come in and take away our right to free 
speech.

1018
00:42:22,471 --> 00:42:23,040
Do you.
Where do you.

1019
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:23,873
Where do you fall on that?

1020
00:42:24,870 --> 00:42:25,940
All?
I want to say this.

1021
00:42:25,941 --> 00:42:30,440
I was just working vegas last weekend.
There was one set where I was having.

1022
00:42:30,460 --> 00:42:31,293
It was a little bit,
the crowd was tight and a guy was 

1023
00:42:33,441 --> 00:42:36,800
sitting with his arms crossed and I for 
15 years I've always said,

1024
00:42:36,801 --> 00:42:38,380
oh,
you know our endoscopes.

1025
00:42:38,470 --> 00:42:40,390
Do you want to let them go?
Or you know,

1026
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:41,233
three guys sitting,
you guys where's the girls and all that 

1027
00:42:43,251 --> 00:42:44,001
were that,
you know,

1028
00:42:44,001 --> 00:42:46,310
that is totally hacky,
but it Kinda gets the crowd,

1029
00:42:46,311 --> 00:42:47,510
you know,
going when you're in the mood.

1030
00:42:47,660 --> 00:42:51,920
But now people aren't buying into those 
jokes and it was a realization of wow,

1031
00:42:52,250 --> 00:42:55,210
people really rpc,
but it's a good thing.

1032
00:42:55,780 --> 00:43:00,780
So I think there is a legitimate reason 
to be pc.

1033
00:43:01,191 --> 00:43:05,460
We're growing as people and and there 
are things we don't accept anymore.

1034
00:43:05,480 --> 00:43:06,313
We don't accept racism anymore.
We don't accept making jokes about gays 

1035
00:43:08,571 --> 00:43:10,160
anymore.
And that's a good thing.

1036
00:43:10,161 --> 00:43:12,290
I think the comedians that say,
oh,

1037
00:43:12,291 --> 00:43:15,170
it's too pc to pc,
they might be correct,

1038
00:43:15,171 --> 00:43:20,171
but in other words,
maybe you need to change to the idea.

1039
00:43:21,720 --> 00:43:22,553
That's interesting because Sarah 
Silverman said something to that effect 

1040
00:43:24,451 --> 00:43:25,284
this week and in an interview,
and I think she was directing it at 

1041
00:43:27,481 --> 00:43:30,330
Seinfeld because Seinfeld basically was 
saying,

1042
00:43:30,510 --> 00:43:31,343
you know,
I used to make this gay joke about a 

1043
00:43:32,101 --> 00:43:33,540
French king and his loose,
you know,

1044
00:43:33,541 --> 00:43:36,000
his hand like this and now they think 
it's too offensive.

1045
00:43:36,090 --> 00:43:39,210
But I would always be on this.
I don't know you to call Seinfeld.

1046
00:43:39,211 --> 00:43:40,044
Politically incorrect.
I don't know what he thinks about 

1047
00:43:41,131 --> 00:43:43,650
anything either thinks about anything.

1048
00:43:43,670 --> 00:43:45,350
Did you hear what he said about that 
cotton ball?

1049
00:43:45,520 --> 00:43:46,880
Yeah,
exactly.

1050
00:43:47,120 --> 00:43:47,660
All right,
so my,

1051
00:43:47,660 --> 00:43:48,500
my weight,
my final,

1052
00:43:48,501 --> 00:43:49,334
but yeah,
wonderful final thought about this 

1053
00:43:50,121 --> 00:43:52,070
because there's comes a time,
right?

1054
00:43:52,071 --> 00:43:52,904
Like so now we've come a long way with 
how gay people are treated in our 

1055
00:43:55,041 --> 00:43:55,874
society in a positive way,
but there's guys who were born at a 

1056
00:43:58,551 --> 00:44:00,860
certain age,
like Alec Baldwin,

1057
00:44:00,890 --> 00:44:01,723
they grew up using gay terms as slurs 
and insults and then when that lizard 

1058
00:44:05,571 --> 00:44:07,880
brain gets activated,
when you're angry at someone,

1059
00:44:07,881 --> 00:44:09,170
those things come up.
Right.

1060
00:44:09,290 --> 00:44:12,710
And so Alec Baldwin got in trouble for 
calling a guy a cock sucking faggot.

1061
00:44:12,740 --> 00:44:14,300
Right?
But he said he called him a cock sucking

1062
00:44:14,420 --> 00:44:17,090
bedhead because apparently cocksuckers 
gender neutral,

1063
00:44:19,100 --> 00:44:20,720
but no one swears like that.
No one.

1064
00:44:20,721 --> 00:44:21,554
Nobody says a $4,
swear word and then follows it up with 

1065
00:44:23,011 --> 00:44:24,770
the cartoons.
Nobody goes,

1066
00:44:24,771 --> 00:44:26,170
oh,
you mother fucking farks narco.

1067
00:44:26,210 --> 00:44:27,720
Right,
right.

1068
00:44:28,070 --> 00:44:29,930
So that's good people.

1069
00:44:29,960 --> 00:44:31,950
A little bit of a leash if you grew up.

1070
00:44:32,630 --> 00:44:33,463
Yeah.
Especially if he apologizes or our lies 

1071
00:44:36,400 --> 00:44:37,540
are lies about it.
Like I haven't.

1072
00:44:37,570 --> 00:44:38,440
Baldwin did,
right?

1073
00:44:38,540 --> 00:44:40,160
No.
If he apologizes.

1074
00:44:40,161 --> 00:44:40,994
Look,
my dad said racist things when I was 

1075
00:44:42,681 --> 00:44:45,500
growing up.
My Dad would never do it now,

1076
00:44:45,501 --> 00:44:46,334
but he should get bull connor.
But when I was growing up as a 27 year 

1077
00:44:50,451 --> 00:44:51,284
old man or a 30 year old man,
he said stuff and my brother made would 

1078
00:44:53,631 --> 00:44:54,464
be like director and now he would never 
do that because everyone grows at a 

1079
00:44:57,501 --> 00:44:58,760
different rate,
you know,

1080
00:44:58,761 --> 00:45:01,880
people are learning at different ages 
and you know.

1081
00:45:02,600 --> 00:45:04,140
Um.
All right.

1082
00:45:04,150 --> 00:45:05,840
So I apologize at least.
So

1083
00:45:05,980 --> 00:45:07,640
yeah.
So I thought that the,

1084
00:45:07,641 --> 00:45:11,480
the right way to end something with 
comedians would be to talk about counter

1085
00:45:11,481 --> 00:45:12,314
culture a little bit because 
counterculture is what standup grew out 

1086
00:45:15,161 --> 00:45:15,790
of,
right?

1087
00:45:15,790 --> 00:45:18,400
It used to be cool to fight the system.
Yes.

1088
00:45:18,460 --> 00:45:21,460
And I feel like it's not cool to fight 
the system anymore.

1089
00:45:21,461 --> 00:45:24,640
You're thought of as crazy or something 
or something.

1090
00:45:24,641 --> 00:45:28,510
I think it has a lot to do with that.
Most comics are liberal.

1091
00:45:28,511 --> 00:45:30,760
Most comics really,
at least at the beginning,

1092
00:45:30,761 --> 00:45:32,620
really liked Obama.
So everybody would say,

1093
00:45:32,630 --> 00:45:33,463
oh,
it's tough to make jokes about this guy 

1094
00:45:34,811 --> 00:45:38,710
because he's rational and speaks clearly
and he is not making all the grammatical

1095
00:45:38,711 --> 00:45:40,570
errors that Bush was making.
Um,

1096
00:45:40,840 --> 00:45:41,673
now it's changed and I think people 
don't necessarily like Obama as much or 

1097
00:45:44,771 --> 00:45:46,750
at least people on the left that field 
that he's,

1098
00:45:46,950 --> 00:45:48,130
you know,
been more right wing.

1099
00:45:48,131 --> 00:45:48,964
I think certainly that's what you think.
But we don't have a real counterculture 

1100
00:45:53,080 --> 00:45:55,750
anymore.
How do we need a Republican in office to

1101
00:45:55,751 --> 00:46:00,751
have a true counterculture?
Would that actually help the country?

1102
00:46:01,480 --> 00:46:05,890
People have someone that I believe in,
nothing that they actually stand for

1103
00:46:05,940 --> 00:46:10,020
the argument that would strengthen the 
argument has been made that Barack Obama

1104
00:46:10,050 --> 00:46:10,883
being the head of the government right 
now splits the opposition because 

1105
00:46:13,801 --> 00:46:14,634
they're the people.
So we should be opposing him about the 

1106
00:46:16,441 --> 00:46:18,660
indefinite detention,
TPP,

1107
00:46:19,330 --> 00:46:21,390
you know,
all that stuff that Syria war with.

1108
00:46:25,050 --> 00:46:26,790
You and I are on the same page on this.
So we should.

1109
00:46:26,910 --> 00:46:27,743
So what?
By Barack Obama being the head of the 

1110
00:46:29,251 --> 00:46:30,084
government,
he splits the opposition because half 

1111
00:46:31,261 --> 00:46:32,094
the people are loyalty and then the 
other half the people are telling the 

1112
00:46:34,561 --> 00:46:35,394
truth or wanting to push back and 
protest against a terror radical 

1113
00:46:38,131 --> 00:46:40,050
government are bullshit that they see in
the government.

1114
00:46:40,140 --> 00:46:43,080
And so it doesn't happen.
That's exactly what's happening and that

1115
00:46:43,081 --> 00:46:45,140
is what happened and that's why there is
no counterculture.

1116
00:46:45,250 --> 00:46:46,410
Good enough for you to pick up on it.

1117
00:46:46,410 --> 00:46:49,540
I get a couple every episode I get one 
or two bring,

1118
00:46:49,920 --> 00:46:50,670
bring us home,
bring it up.

1119
00:46:50,670 --> 00:46:51,503
Well,
uh,

1120
00:46:51,510 --> 00:46:54,600
I was watching Bill Maher the other 
night and he was of course making fun of

1121
00:46:54,601 --> 00:46:55,434
Republicans and George Pataki was on 
there and it's gotten to the point 

1122
00:46:58,950 --> 00:46:59,790
where,
yeah,

1123
00:46:59,791 --> 00:47:00,624
you want to have one Republican in the 
mix when you're talking politics and 

1124
00:47:04,171 --> 00:47:05,760
doing the counterculture thing,
all that.

1125
00:47:06,060 --> 00:47:06,893
But even George Pataki's like,
well my poverty and it's just an 

1126
00:47:12,151 --> 00:47:16,650
indication of we've just all moved to 
the right,

1127
00:47:16,960 --> 00:47:17,793
right.
So maybe we do need a Republican in 

1128
00:47:19,121 --> 00:47:22,540
office to wake up the people to actually
realize what's important.

1129
00:47:22,541 --> 00:47:23,100
Yes.
And,

1130
00:47:23,100 --> 00:47:24,640
and it would at least be good for 
comedians.

1131
00:47:24,760 --> 00:47:25,151
Alright.
Right.

1132
00:47:25,151 --> 00:47:27,250
On that note,
I want to thank Felicia Michael's,

1133
00:47:27,430 --> 00:47:28,960
Jimmy Dore.
You can follow them.

1134
00:47:29,140 --> 00:47:29,973
Twitter and Youtube and websites.
They got all that stuff and we're going 

1135
00:47:32,451 --> 00:47:34,420
to put some of it right beneath you.
And Jimmy's got a book.

1136
00:47:34,800 --> 00:47:36,670
It's called your country's just not that
into you.

1137
00:47:36,720 --> 00:47:38,070
Yeah,
they are.

1138
00:47:38,140 --> 00:47:40,120
All books are sold everywhere.
There you go.

1139
00:47:40,121 --> 00:47:41,200
All right.
Thanks for watching guys.

1140
00:47:41,201 --> 00:47:42,370
And we will do it again next week.
