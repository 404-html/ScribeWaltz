Paul,

3
00:00:09,091 --> 00:00:10,170
welcome to the Rubin report.

4
00:00:11,100 --> 00:00:12,270
Hi Dave.
Good to be here.

5
00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:16,310
I'm glad you are here.
When we were talking before we started,

6
00:00:16,311 --> 00:00:19,100
you were saying that I'm going to get.
I'm going to get some hate for this.

7
00:00:19,130 --> 00:00:20,910
Are you warning me of pre hate?

8
00:00:21,910 --> 00:00:22,743
I think you've probably already got some
hate just for announcing that I'm going 

9
00:00:24,991 --> 00:00:25,824
to be on.
I mean there's a lot of people who have 

10
00:00:27,281 --> 00:00:32,080
some kind of pull her over for wars and 
Alex Jones I think is,

11
00:00:32,110 --> 00:00:33,880
you know,
conspiracy central,

12
00:00:33,881 --> 00:00:36,580
but most people don't realize that,
you know,

13
00:00:36,581 --> 00:00:37,414
Alex is not this big main controlling 
force like dictating what everybody 

14
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:41,833
says.
He pretty much gives me free reign to 

15
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:47,010
talk about whatever I want and that's 
what's good about info wars.

16
00:00:47,011 --> 00:00:49,840
It's a very broad church.
So you've got,

17
00:00:49,870 --> 00:00:50,703
you know,
numerous reits as commentators who 

18
00:00:52,031 --> 00:00:52,864
worked with him for wars and they can 
basically talk about and write about 

19
00:00:56,171 --> 00:00:58,960
whatever they want.
So as far as I'm concerned,

20
00:00:58,961 --> 00:00:59,794
that's the best job imaginable.
So I think people need to get over it 

21
00:01:03,941 --> 00:01:04,774
and move on because the sun is that 
we're talking about supersede any 

22
00:01:09,130 --> 00:01:11,560
perception about what info wars is 
about,

23
00:01:11,561 --> 00:01:14,080
what people think it's about.
So you know,

24
00:01:14,081 --> 00:01:14,914
I just want people to listen to what 
I've got to say and concentrate on the 

25
00:01:17,171 --> 00:01:18,940
sun rather than,
you know,

26
00:01:18,941 --> 00:01:22,330
what website is hosted on that's 
irrelevant at the end of the day.

27
00:01:22,420 --> 00:01:23,980
Right.
And that's exactly what happened.

28
00:01:23,981 --> 00:01:24,814
I mean I just sent one tweet out this 
morning saying that you were coming on 

29
00:01:26,981 --> 00:01:29,350
the show and immediate conspiracy 
theorist,

30
00:01:29,351 --> 00:01:30,184
he works with Alex Jones and it's like 
you guys are having conspiracy theories 

31
00:01:33,071 --> 00:01:35,530
about the conspiracy theory.
So I was like,

32
00:01:35,531 --> 00:01:36,364
you know,
let's just talk it out and we'll see 

33
00:01:37,301 --> 00:01:38,134
what happens.
Right.

34
00:01:38,970 --> 00:01:41,810
No,
it's not as bad as it used to be.

35
00:01:41,811 --> 00:01:44,360
I mean I know there's this perception 
out there that,

36
00:01:44,390 --> 00:01:47,150
you know,
Info wars is discredited or whatever,

37
00:01:47,151 --> 00:01:48,980
but I mean when breaking stuff every 
day.

38
00:01:48,981 --> 00:01:50,990
Well linked on the drudge report,
you know,

39
00:01:50,991 --> 00:01:54,080
we've got 20 million listeners a week 
now for the radio show.

40
00:01:54,081 --> 00:01:57,970
So whether you like cars or not,
wherever a presence and you know,

41
00:01:58,030 --> 00:01:59,990
that's why some people have a problem 
with it,

42
00:01:59,991 --> 00:02:00,824
but as I said,
just concentrate on the issues of what 

43
00:02:02,751 --> 00:02:03,584
I'm saying and in fact my youtube 
channel explores these kinds of issues 

44
00:02:07,071 --> 00:02:10,910
off on a tangent from the normal content
that info was,

45
00:02:10,911 --> 00:02:11,744
would cover.
So I've kind of attracted a new 

46
00:02:13,850 --> 00:02:18,850
satellite audience outside of Info wars,
so it's all about bringing new people in

47
00:02:18,951 --> 00:02:19,784
and that's why I've attempted to do,
that's where I think I've been 

48
00:02:21,831 --> 00:02:22,970
successful recently.

49
00:02:23,130 --> 00:02:23,963
Yeah.
And it's your youtube channel that 

50
00:02:24,751 --> 00:02:25,584
actually got me familiar with what you 
were doing because you did a phenomenal 

51
00:02:28,111 --> 00:02:31,320
video on the regressive left,
which everyone knows.

52
00:02:31,321 --> 00:02:32,154
I'm not a fan of them.
You've done some really interesting 

53
00:02:34,051 --> 00:02:36,090
stuff about the European immigration 
crisis.

54
00:02:36,210 --> 00:02:37,043
So yeah,
we're going to get into all the issues 

55
00:02:37,861 --> 00:02:38,670
stuff.
Uh,

56
00:02:38,670 --> 00:02:41,280
but just to wrap up the info wars part 
of this,

57
00:02:41,430 --> 00:02:45,750
how did you get involved with Info wars?
What's your relationship like with Alex?

58
00:02:45,850 --> 00:02:47,400
Let's go down that route for a little 
bit.

59
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:49,313
Well,
I mean I started my own political 

60
00:02:50,681 --> 00:02:53,290
website when I was about 18 years old,
so you know,

61
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:58,320
I would go home and host a radio show on
dial up internet to three people,

62
00:02:58,900 --> 00:03:00,640
two listeners,
you know,

63
00:03:00,641 --> 00:03:01,474
back in the early two thousands.
So that was the very genesis of Alex 

64
00:03:05,231 --> 00:03:08,080
liked what he was doing.
He liked the content I was covering,

65
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:10,470
so he basically headhunted me and said,
you know,

66
00:03:10,550 --> 00:03:13,930
coming in and edit info was coming right
for us.

67
00:03:14,250 --> 00:03:15,650
And that's,
that's what happened.

68
00:03:15,651 --> 00:03:19,300
So now I'm based in London.
They're based in Austin,

69
00:03:19,301 --> 00:03:20,860
Texas,
so I'm a,

70
00:03:20,890 --> 00:03:21,723
you know,
six hours ahead of time so I can get a 

71
00:03:23,681 --> 00:03:27,850
jump on the news that's always 
beneficial with a news organization.

72
00:03:28,180 --> 00:03:31,720
So that's why it kind of works and he 
lets me write and say what I want.

73
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:35,440
He's not this controlling presence and 
you know,

74
00:03:35,470 --> 00:03:36,303
a lot of people think that Alex Jones is
a kind of act that it's put on this 

75
00:03:39,701 --> 00:03:40,534
radio personality that he has.
But if you meet him and you hang around 

76
00:03:43,241 --> 00:03:45,430
with him,
what you see is what you get.

77
00:03:45,431 --> 00:03:47,920
That's how I like joke.
He's like that all the time.

78
00:03:48,010 --> 00:03:50,140
It's not an act.
He's not putting it on,

79
00:03:50,590 --> 00:03:51,001
you know,
in,

80
00:03:51,001 --> 00:03:52,000
in private,
in,

81
00:03:52,001 --> 00:03:52,834
in person.
He's kind of more jovial and fun than 

82
00:03:54,611 --> 00:03:58,060
his rants on the radio would suggest,
but that's him.

83
00:03:58,061 --> 00:03:59,920
That's his personality.
It's not an act.

84
00:04:00,220 --> 00:04:01,150
Yeah.
I'm curious,

85
00:04:01,151 --> 00:04:01,984
were you trepidatious to,
to join forces with him because 

86
00:04:04,991 --> 00:04:07,510
obviously it was a good opportunity.
It's saying that it's worked for you.

87
00:04:07,690 --> 00:04:08,523
Uh,
but because of what I said before about 

88
00:04:09,521 --> 00:04:12,040
I just send one tweet out and people 
start yelling at me.

89
00:04:12,041 --> 00:04:14,290
You must have had some level of concern.
Right?

90
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:17,300
Well that was,
that was a long time ago,

91
00:04:17,301 --> 00:04:20,270
back in the day.
So really Alex was only a few years into

92
00:04:20,271 --> 00:04:21,104
his operation.
I built up a good deal of traffic with 

93
00:04:24,231 --> 00:04:26,840
my own website.
So there was no trepidation.

94
00:04:26,841 --> 00:04:29,000
It was just about reaching a wider 
audience.

95
00:04:29,001 --> 00:04:32,150
So obviously I jumped at the 
opportunity.

96
00:04:32,380 --> 00:04:33,213
Yeah.
So where do you actually consider 

97
00:04:34,781 --> 00:04:35,614
yourself politically?
I think I have a good sense and one of 

98
00:04:38,291 --> 00:04:42,070
the things we've been talking about here
is sort of this new growing center.

99
00:04:42,071 --> 00:04:45,460
People who really want to stand up for 
free speech and civil liberties,

100
00:04:45,461 --> 00:04:46,294
but also understand that we have real 
threats and that this immigration issue 

101
00:04:49,601 --> 00:04:50,434
in Europe is a big problem.
They want to be able to honestly talk 

102
00:04:52,661 --> 00:04:53,570
about Islam.
Islam.

103
00:04:53,740 --> 00:04:56,470
So the old dynamic of right,
left Democrat,

104
00:04:56,471 --> 00:04:59,080
conservative for us in the states.
It all seems to be crumbling.

105
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:01,330
So I'm curious,
what do you even consider yourself if,

106
00:05:01,340 --> 00:05:02,680
if you had to go with a label?

107
00:05:03,860 --> 00:05:05,170
Um,
well,

108
00:05:05,171 --> 00:05:06,004
I grew up,
obviously when I was a teenager I was a 

109
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:10,720
progressive and I think it was Winston 
Churchill that said,

110
00:05:11,020 --> 00:05:12,790
if you're not a liberal when you're 
young,

111
00:05:12,791 --> 00:05:15,820
you have no heart if you're not a 
conservative when you get older,

112
00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:16,773
you have no brain.
So a moment in my thirties I would 

113
00:05:19,931 --> 00:05:20,764
consider myself mainly a limited area 
and maybe you could call me a 

114
00:05:23,711 --> 00:05:24,544
conservative area,
but it's somewhere within that gap 

115
00:05:26,741 --> 00:05:27,574
between the two.
So that's basically where I'm at right 

116
00:05:29,861 --> 00:05:30,300
now.

117
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:33,270
Yeah.
Do you find that movement growing,

118
00:05:33,330 --> 00:05:34,500
uh,
where you are?

119
00:05:34,501 --> 00:05:36,420
Because I do sense it's growing here.
You know,

120
00:05:36,421 --> 00:05:39,170
our politics have gotten so crazy,
uh,

121
00:05:39,270 --> 00:05:40,103
between a democratic socialist who's the
hot guy on the left and trump who is 

122
00:05:43,481 --> 00:05:46,370
sort of off the rails but confused,
you know,

123
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:50,310
is he really a Republican?
Does he stand for conservative values or

124
00:05:50,311 --> 00:05:52,800
is he truly a centrist?
None of it makes sense anymore.

125
00:05:52,830 --> 00:05:54,840
Are you guys getting some of that 
feeling too?

126
00:05:56,110 --> 00:05:57,590
So some,
some extent.

127
00:05:57,591 --> 00:05:58,424
Yeah,
but I mean in the UK it's still 

128
00:06:00,170 --> 00:06:02,240
extremely left wing.
I mean even,

129
00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:05,540
even the Tory party isn't classically 
conservative.

130
00:06:05,541 --> 00:06:06,374
They're somewhat left on a lot of Su,
so most people don't even know what a 

131
00:06:10,101 --> 00:06:12,200
libertarian is in the UK,
to be honest,

132
00:06:12,201 --> 00:06:13,034
the only people who are really 
politically active will know what that 

133
00:06:15,081 --> 00:06:15,914
actually means.
So I think America is streets ahead in 

134
00:06:19,401 --> 00:06:24,290
the sense of actually understanding that
there is a political alternative outside

135
00:06:24,291 --> 00:06:27,710
of progressivism,
which is still what dominates the entire

136
00:06:27,711 --> 00:06:31,100
discourse in the UK.
I mean people will think you're a racist

137
00:06:31,101 --> 00:06:34,970
or a bigger if you're not a progressive,
especially as a young person.

138
00:06:35,270 --> 00:06:36,103
So the circles in which I move,
there's very little understanding about 

139
00:06:39,081 --> 00:06:42,980
what these labels mean,
which is why I try to concentrate on the

140
00:06:42,981 --> 00:06:44,420
issues without,
you know,

141
00:06:44,570 --> 00:06:46,760
coming at it from a left or right 
persuasion.

142
00:06:46,950 --> 00:06:47,783
Yeah.
And that's very much what I've tried to 

143
00:06:48,451 --> 00:06:51,450
do and I've tried to define a lot of 
these terms and you know,

144
00:06:51,451 --> 00:06:54,510
the whole Libertarian ideology really 
fits with me,

145
00:06:54,511 --> 00:06:57,600
you know what I mean?
Like do with your body what you want,

146
00:06:57,601 --> 00:07:00,790
let the government stay out of your life
for the most part and,

147
00:07:00,791 --> 00:07:01,624
and build a life that works for you.
But you're saying that that the idea of 

148
00:07:06,001 --> 00:07:08,400
that is really gone in the UK now.

149
00:07:09,410 --> 00:07:11,760
I don't really.
I don't think it was ever here really.

150
00:07:11,761 --> 00:07:13,590
I don't think people came to grips with 
it.

151
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:14,670
Yeah.
I mean there's still,

152
00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:18,960
there's still some debate within 
libertarian circles about certain issues

153
00:07:18,961 --> 00:07:19,794
like abortion or like open borders.
I mean some Libertarians think that to 

154
00:07:22,921 --> 00:07:27,150
be truly classically libertarian you 
have to advocate open borders.

155
00:07:27,151 --> 00:07:28,620
Other people say,
well,

156
00:07:28,621 --> 00:07:29,454
no,
that's the government foisting open 

157
00:07:30,961 --> 00:07:33,210
borders upon the people,
you know,

158
00:07:33,211 --> 00:07:36,840
taking their tax money to pay for it,
but I mean within the UK,

159
00:07:37,230 --> 00:07:39,510
as far as I'm concerned,
in my experience,

160
00:07:39,511 --> 00:07:42,360
these,
these labels aren't even known,

161
00:07:42,390 --> 00:07:43,223
they're not even defined.
So when you describe yourself as a 

162
00:07:46,021 --> 00:07:49,410
libertarian,
people have no frame of reference,

163
00:07:49,770 --> 00:07:50,603
so they think if you're not a liberal,
then you must be on some obscure fringe 

164
00:07:54,001 --> 00:07:56,340
of the political spectrum.
But you know,

165
00:07:56,341 --> 00:07:58,710
I guess the,
the understanding is growing,

166
00:07:58,711 --> 00:08:03,600
especially with the backlash against 
social justice warriors,

167
00:08:03,601 --> 00:08:06,330
which has really accelerated in the past
18 months.

168
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:08,220
So now these issues are,
uh,

169
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:09,113
beginning to be brought to the fore.
Now people are beginning to understand 

170
00:08:12,331 --> 00:08:17,331
that libertarianism is a backlash 
against authoritarianism,

171
00:08:17,730 --> 00:08:18,563
which of course is embodied by this 
feminist third wave feminist social 

172
00:08:21,391 --> 00:08:22,470
justice warrior movement.

173
00:08:22,620 --> 00:08:23,101
Yeah,
you're,

174
00:08:23,101 --> 00:08:23,934
you're hitting all the buzzwords there.
So do you think it's really just a 

175
00:08:26,461 --> 00:08:27,294
branding issue for Libertarians?
Because there's sort of no unifying 

176
00:08:30,301 --> 00:08:31,134
principle that's bringing us together 
other than do what you'd like and don't 

177
00:08:35,491 --> 00:08:38,070
harm someone.
So they just need sort of better.

178
00:08:38,130 --> 00:08:38,963
There are a good reps basically,
or at least from what I see in the 

179
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,800
United States,
we have a couple of Gary Johnson,

180
00:08:43,801 --> 00:08:44,634
former governor of New Mexico,
had on the show and he's running for 

181
00:08:46,531 --> 00:08:47,364
president,
but it's hard to gain traction when 

182
00:08:48,691 --> 00:08:49,680
you're one of the outsiders.

183
00:08:50,990 --> 00:08:51,823
Yeah.
I was thinking the problem with 

184
00:08:52,301 --> 00:08:57,030
libertarianism is they're not on the 
frontier of political discourse.

185
00:08:57,031 --> 00:09:00,360
So when you get major issues that crop 
up in the news media,

186
00:09:00,570 --> 00:09:03,270
obviously as somebody who's politically 
active,

187
00:09:03,271 --> 00:09:04,104
you have to seize upon them and tell 
your story and try and control change 

188
00:09:07,621 --> 00:09:08,454
that narrative as best you see fit.
But Libertarians tend to get stuck in 

189
00:09:13,021 --> 00:09:14,580
the weeds,
you know,

190
00:09:14,581 --> 00:09:15,414
they're always arguing with each other 
about these new issues and they're not 

191
00:09:19,321 --> 00:09:22,920
really on the frontier of the cultural 
discourse,

192
00:09:23,190 --> 00:09:24,310
which is more,
you know,

193
00:09:24,330 --> 00:09:25,163
now the domain of,
of conservative areas and people who 

194
00:09:27,511 --> 00:09:28,344
oppose social justice warriors.
So I think in America the libertarian 

195
00:09:31,141 --> 00:09:34,950
movement is still so stuck in the weeds 
and arguing,

196
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:35,953
you know,
my new shit between themselves that 

197
00:09:37,670 --> 00:09:39,360
they're not really,
um,

198
00:09:39,790 --> 00:09:40,623
a robust forces they could be.
I think that's one region in which they 

199
00:09:44,581 --> 00:09:48,930
could improve by hijacking these key 
issues,

200
00:09:48,931 --> 00:09:52,890
these core issues like the migrant 
crisis and they're not doing that,

201
00:09:52,891 --> 00:09:53,724
that they're debating with each other 
over what minute ism is and whether we 

202
00:09:58,020 --> 00:09:58,853
should have no government or limited 
government and they have speeches and 

203
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:03,353
three our youtube conversations about 
that and they're not really reaching 

204
00:10:06,811 --> 00:10:08,670
anyone outside their inner circle.

205
00:10:08,670 --> 00:10:10,440
So I think that's how,
you know,

206
00:10:10,441 --> 00:10:12,540
libertarianism needs to improve in that 
way.

207
00:10:13,170 --> 00:10:14,003
So I guess the silver lining to all of 
this is that because of the social 

208
00:10:18,481 --> 00:10:19,314
justice warrior thing and now we can get
into some of these issues is they're 

209
00:10:22,261 --> 00:10:25,920
starting to push people into this idea 
of libertarianism,

210
00:10:25,921 --> 00:10:26,880
which is nice.
So let's,

211
00:10:27,060 --> 00:10:28,800
let's go to the social justice warrior 
stuff.

212
00:10:28,980 --> 00:10:33,980
You are not a fan of the social justice 
warrior movement to put it mildly.

213
00:10:34,330 --> 00:10:35,161
Uh,
when,

214
00:10:35,161 --> 00:10:38,430
when did you wake up to it?
When did you really see it as,

215
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:40,410
as a threat to free speech?

216
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:45,330
I think it was probably made 2014.
I mean,

217
00:10:45,331 --> 00:10:46,164
I was,
I was mainly covering geopolitical 

218
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:50,670
issues back in 2012,
2013.

219
00:10:50,671 --> 00:10:54,630
I was mainly on the Syrian civil war,
the buildup,

220
00:10:54,660 --> 00:10:55,493
the arms race that the confrontation 
with Russia over the course of 2013 to 

221
00:10:59,941 --> 00:11:00,774
2014 and then I became more active on 
twitter and it's only when you become 

222
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:05,933
active on twitter and you have to 
actually put some time into it and 

223
00:11:09,121 --> 00:11:09,954
follow the discourse that's taking place
on twitter that you realize that these 

224
00:11:13,411 --> 00:11:16,890
issues are important because it's no 
longer just,

225
00:11:17,180 --> 00:11:18,013
you know,
demented 14 year olds on tumbler 

226
00:11:20,910 --> 00:11:24,150
expressing that bizarre arcane 
grievances.

227
00:11:24,330 --> 00:11:29,150
These people are in the universities.
They are our future thought leaders that

228
00:11:29,220 --> 00:11:32,790
are being cuddled.
They're being protected by professors at

229
00:11:32,791 --> 00:11:33,624
these major universities.
So it was that connection between 

230
00:11:36,421 --> 00:11:40,920
realizing that this is not just idiots 
within opinion on twitter,

231
00:11:40,921 --> 00:11:41,754
which is completely obscure.
This is now a really robust driving 

232
00:11:45,541 --> 00:11:46,880
narrative,
uh,

233
00:11:46,970 --> 00:11:47,520
with,
uh,

234
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:49,020
amongst millennials.
And that's,

235
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:51,390
once you realize that once you realize 
how it's,

236
00:11:51,660 --> 00:11:52,493
how it's infested the core of the 
education system in America and now in 

237
00:11:56,951 --> 00:11:57,784
Britain as well,
that to me really symbolized how 

238
00:12:00,911 --> 00:12:01,744
important it was to oppose these people 
because they oppose everything I stand 

239
00:12:05,831 --> 00:12:06,710
for.
You know,

240
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:09,280
within the tenets of libertarianism 
itself.

241
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:10,050
Yeah.
You know,

242
00:12:10,050 --> 00:12:11,910
it's interesting because I had very 
similar,

243
00:12:11,911 --> 00:12:12,744
probably around the same time a 
awakening about this because it was a 

244
00:12:15,901 --> 00:12:17,010
lot on twitter,
right?

245
00:12:17,011 --> 00:12:17,844
Because you're seeing this stuff on 
twitter and you see the stuff from 

246
00:12:20,371 --> 00:12:21,204
tumbler that makes its way over and all 
these people fighting about this stuff 

247
00:12:23,580 --> 00:12:27,210
that we hear about the trigger warnings 
and safe spaces and all of this stuff.

248
00:12:27,510 --> 00:12:28,343
But I could never really figure out how 
much of this just existed for people 

249
00:12:33,241 --> 00:12:36,390
behind computers.
But basically what you're saying is that

250
00:12:36,391 --> 00:12:37,224
there's been.
This has been a long time coming and 

251
00:12:38,431 --> 00:12:40,770
that's what sorta has seeped into the 
university space.

252
00:12:40,771 --> 00:12:41,604
Right?

253
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:46,080
Right.
And now it's becoming really physical.

254
00:12:46,081 --> 00:12:46,914
I mean,
you've seen the Bernie Sanders people 

255
00:12:48,031 --> 00:12:50,070
and we're going to get into the whole 
trump thing lights,

256
00:12:50,071 --> 00:12:51,690
uh,
but we've sent.

257
00:12:51,691 --> 00:12:54,060
Our reporters are to Wisconsin this past
week,

258
00:12:54,061 --> 00:12:55,710
for example.
And you know,

259
00:12:55,711 --> 00:12:59,880
it's not just Bernie Sanders supporters,
it's leftist in general than other ones.

260
00:12:59,910 --> 00:13:00,743
Vial,
hateful people you could ever wish to 

261
00:13:03,421 --> 00:13:04,590
meet.
I mean,

262
00:13:04,591 --> 00:13:05,424
the Shia hatred that they give you like 
radiates from their eyes when you so 

263
00:13:09,301 --> 00:13:13,770
much as disagree with them is palpable 
and now they're out there.

264
00:13:14,010 --> 00:13:16,560
They're shutting down these private 
functions,

265
00:13:16,561 --> 00:13:18,930
these Donald Trump events,
which,

266
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:19,793
whether you agree with trump or not,
that's not your free speech First 

267
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:26,130
Amendment right to shut down a private 
function.

268
00:13:26,430 --> 00:13:29,790
You're impinging on other people's First
Amendment by doing that.

269
00:13:30,150 --> 00:13:32,570
And these people wave signs saying,
you know,

270
00:13:32,580 --> 00:13:37,580
oppose hatred or bigotry that have the 
most hateful people you could imagine.

271
00:13:38,490 --> 00:13:41,370
So that's what I see now,
the translation from twitter,

272
00:13:41,610 --> 00:13:43,860
now they're getting out on the streets 
of girls.

273
00:13:43,861 --> 00:13:48,630
We've seen that with black lives matter 
that metastasized into a similar,

274
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:50,610
hateful,
violent movement.

275
00:13:50,670 --> 00:13:52,800
And we might get into that later.
But yeah,

276
00:13:52,801 --> 00:13:53,320
it's,
it's,

277
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:54,153
it's manifesting physically now.
And it's why people are worried about 

278
00:13:57,150 --> 00:13:57,983
civil unrest and riots quite frankly 
because these people are prone to 

279
00:14:02,071 --> 00:14:03,990
violence and they're very hateful 
people.

280
00:14:04,290 --> 00:14:04,771
So.
Okay,

281
00:14:04,771 --> 00:14:06,870
so we're gonna get into all of that.
So.

282
00:14:06,900 --> 00:14:07,733
But you hit on a lot of things there.
So one of the things that I've been 

283
00:14:09,001 --> 00:14:09,834
saying is I can't believe we're at a 
place in 2016 in America where I fear 

284
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:14,873
that it will be us ourselves,
the citizens who will take away our 

285
00:14:18,481 --> 00:14:20,610
right to free speech more than the 
government.

286
00:14:20,790 --> 00:14:21,623
So in other words,
it's not a first amendment issue in 

287
00:14:23,251 --> 00:14:25,740
these people protest because it's not 
the government doing it,

288
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:26,933
but we do have a certain social contract
that you have to let people speak and 

289
00:14:30,181 --> 00:14:33,180
then you can use your speech to 
counteract it.

290
00:14:33,390 --> 00:14:34,223
But basically you're saying by blocking 
roads and by stopping people from 

291
00:14:37,951 --> 00:14:40,500
speaking that that's where it becomes a 
free speech issue,

292
00:14:40,650 --> 00:14:42,700
not necessarily a first amendment issue.
Right.

293
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:43,890
You see that distinction?

294
00:14:45,370 --> 00:14:46,203
No,
I've got no problem with people being 

295
00:14:47,031 --> 00:14:47,864
out on the streets protesting.
I mean that's the riots when they 

296
00:14:49,791 --> 00:14:50,624
actually go Donald Trump events in 
private buildings where they've paid to 

297
00:14:56,001 --> 00:14:59,390
hire this building and they got the 
event in Chicago canceled,

298
00:14:59,391 --> 00:15:01,190
for example,
that's impinging on other,

299
00:15:01,660 --> 00:15:02,493
on other people's rights to peaceably 
assemble exercise their first amendment 

300
00:15:06,201 --> 00:15:08,660
and just listen to somebody's speech.
But I mean,

301
00:15:08,661 --> 00:15:11,750
as you touched on before,
it's this whole idea of,

302
00:15:12,350 --> 00:15:13,170
you know,
before the,

303
00:15:13,170 --> 00:15:16,190
the power was in the media and we're 
going to talk about in the media later,

304
00:15:16,490 --> 00:15:17,323
now it's,
it's kind of invested back into the 

305
00:15:19,161 --> 00:15:22,310
hands of people.
It's people power,

306
00:15:22,311 --> 00:15:23,144
but it's people power gone mad.
So now you have organized groups of 

307
00:15:26,481 --> 00:15:30,500
people who go out to publicly shame 
others to get them fired,

308
00:15:30,650 --> 00:15:31,483
to censor content from the Internet.
And that's how twitter in one sense 

309
00:15:35,310 --> 00:15:36,143
empowered the people.
But it gave that power to these 

310
00:15:38,690 --> 00:15:42,650
perpetually outraged mobs.
And that's what woke me up to the social

311
00:15:42,651 --> 00:15:45,270
justice warrior Su,
because as you said it,

312
00:15:45,380 --> 00:15:49,220
the concern for me for a few years ago 
was the states,

313
00:15:49,250 --> 00:15:51,740
the government impinging on our free 
speech rights.

314
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:52,873
Now it's perpetually professionally 
outraged mobs impinging on our free 

315
00:15:57,081 --> 00:15:57,914
speech rights.
I think that's the biggest danger right 

316
00:15:59,691 --> 00:16:03,530
now in 2016 in comparison to anything 
that the state's going to do.

317
00:16:03,690 --> 00:16:05,550
I completely agree.
It's so ironic.

318
00:16:05,551 --> 00:16:06,384
I can't even think of an example right 
now in America where the state is 

319
00:16:10,831 --> 00:16:11,664
holding the first amendment hostage.
I can't find one instance where you 

320
00:16:14,731 --> 00:16:18,900
can't say whatever you want about the 
government or about government officials

321
00:16:18,901 --> 00:16:19,734
or anything like that,
but I can see many instances where the 

322
00:16:21,661 --> 00:16:25,440
mob and the online mob and they'll try 
to stop your patrion funding if you're a

323
00:16:25,441 --> 00:16:26,274
youtuber or they'll try to figure out 
other ways to have you fired or shamed 

324
00:16:29,670 --> 00:16:32,070
or whatever else.
Do you think that these people,

325
00:16:32,071 --> 00:16:32,904
like for example,
when trump was doing the rally in 

326
00:16:34,231 --> 00:16:37,020
Arizona and they blocked the road in 
Arizona,

327
00:16:37,380 --> 00:16:38,213
do you think that they thought that they
were helping their cause because I get 

328
00:16:42,661 --> 00:16:44,370
it,
but not all of these people are thinking

329
00:16:44,371 --> 00:16:47,100
all their moves through properly and 
they know they're going out.

330
00:16:47,101 --> 00:16:49,320
We're going to stop them from showing up
and that's all good,

331
00:16:49,620 --> 00:16:54,420
but to me all they really do is 
strengthened trump because then look,

332
00:16:54,450 --> 00:16:57,510
nobody that didn't get there is suddenly
not gonna vote for trump.

333
00:16:57,511 --> 00:16:58,344
It makes them want to vote for trump 
more than everyone watching it on the 

334
00:17:00,331 --> 00:17:01,890
news is going,
wow,

335
00:17:01,891 --> 00:17:04,740
who's being oppressed here?
It's actually trump,

336
00:17:04,950 --> 00:17:06,390
so it's really.
It's fascinating,

337
00:17:06,391 --> 00:17:07,224
right?

338
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:08,873
No,
I don't know if they've got any idea of 

339
00:17:10,941 --> 00:17:11,774
how ridiculous they look,
but they've got this media narrative 

340
00:17:14,840 --> 00:17:18,440
backing them up,
which is that trump is inciting violence

341
00:17:18,441 --> 00:17:20,120
and this is something that I've been hot
on.

342
00:17:20,390 --> 00:17:22,520
Again,
I don't agree with trump on everything.

343
00:17:22,521 --> 00:17:23,354
I'm not a vehement trump supporter,
but if you go on twitter on any single 

344
00:17:27,530 --> 00:17:31,970
day and search for assassinate trump or 
kill trump,

345
00:17:32,380 --> 00:17:35,630
you will find hundreds and hundreds of 
examples.

346
00:17:35,940 --> 00:17:38,510
Obviously most people don't mean it.
They're not going to do anything,

347
00:17:38,990 --> 00:17:39,823
but they're threatening to assassinate 
trump and yet the whole media narrative 

348
00:17:42,980 --> 00:17:43,813
is about how trump supports as a violent
about how trump himself is inciting 

349
00:17:47,781 --> 00:17:51,780
violence.
There's a video on youtube right now and

350
00:17:51,781 --> 00:17:52,830
we complain about,
you know,

351
00:17:52,831 --> 00:17:56,910
to a TSA censoring conservatives for 
having the wrong political opinion.

352
00:17:57,270 --> 00:17:58,103
There's a guy who's still on twitter.
His account hasn't been touched by the 

353
00:18:01,050 --> 00:18:02,710
trust and safety council.

354
00:18:02,710 --> 00:18:06,060
Yeah.
He's got a youtube video which calls for

355
00:18:06,330 --> 00:18:08,640
caving.
Trump's head in with a shovel,

356
00:18:08,910 --> 00:18:09,743
shooting him with an AK 47.
Filling him full of bullets is not even 

357
00:18:14,470 --> 00:18:16,380
age restricted on Youtube.
I mean,

358
00:18:16,381 --> 00:18:21,381
I've had videos age restricted for swear
words and the media came out afterwards.

359
00:18:22,780 --> 00:18:27,780
This is a rap video out of a Baltimore 
unbuildable dot.

360
00:18:28,121 --> 00:18:31,320
Come celebrate today as a powerful 
protest song.

361
00:18:31,770 --> 00:18:35,940
This is a group of young men in a rap 
video threatening to kill Donald Trump.

362
00:18:36,180 --> 00:18:37,013
Imagine if you know the Oregon militia 
or whoever had come out with a video 

363
00:18:40,801 --> 00:18:42,870
threatening to assassinate Hillary 
Clinton.

364
00:18:43,060 --> 00:18:43,893
Do you think the media would be 
celebrating it as a powerful protest 

365
00:18:46,741 --> 00:18:47,574
song?
So it's that double standard they're 

366
00:18:49,261 --> 00:18:50,094
given left media cover because we've got
this narrative that trump's inciting 

367
00:18:54,061 --> 00:18:54,894
violence when again,
they're the most hateful violent people 

368
00:18:57,990 --> 00:18:58,610
out there.

369
00:18:58,610 --> 00:18:59,443
Well,
it's so fascinating because as you've 

370
00:19:00,591 --> 00:19:01,970
repeated several times,
now,

371
00:19:01,971 --> 00:19:05,270
you're not even a huge trump supporter,
and yet you're,

372
00:19:05,430 --> 00:19:09,050
you are put in a position where you have
to defend some of these ideals.

373
00:19:09,110 --> 00:19:11,750
I'm not a trump supporter and I,
I feel the same way.

374
00:19:11,751 --> 00:19:14,180
If I want to stand up for the ideals 
that I stand for,

375
00:19:14,270 --> 00:19:18,770
I have to call this nonsense out because
apparently no one in the media do it.

376
00:19:18,771 --> 00:19:20,300
You know,
there's another great example of that.

377
00:19:20,301 --> 00:19:21,134
Did you see a couple of weeks ago when 
that guy tried to bum rush trump on 

378
00:19:24,111 --> 00:19:24,944
stage and then the next night he was on 
cnn and all the news channels and they 

379
00:19:28,911 --> 00:19:33,050
were treating him as if he was some 
legit voice of counter protests,

380
00:19:33,051 --> 00:19:33,884
but meanwhile he was trying to attack a 
presidential candidate whether you like 

381
00:19:36,801 --> 00:19:38,270
trump or not.
Right?

382
00:19:38,271 --> 00:19:39,104
So this is.
This is fully the fault of the media 

383
00:19:40,191 --> 00:19:41,024
here,
right?

384
00:19:42,020 --> 00:19:42,721
Well,
exactly.

385
00:19:42,721 --> 00:19:47,010
I mean you flip it around if,
if a right winger tried to attack Bernie

386
00:19:47,010 --> 00:19:47,843
Sanders or Hillary Clinton,
that he wouldn't be on CNN the next day 

387
00:19:50,731 --> 00:19:54,300
being given a complimentary welcoming 
platform.

388
00:19:54,301 --> 00:19:56,790
Yet we see this again and again and you 
know,

389
00:19:56,791 --> 00:19:57,624
trump is a creation of social justice 
warriors at the end of the day have 

390
00:20:00,570 --> 00:20:05,490
reaction as an equal and opposite 
reaction and people are just tired.

391
00:20:05,510 --> 00:20:08,280
That tired of being lectured about how 
racist they are.

392
00:20:08,420 --> 00:20:09,253
They're tired about being lectured to 
check their privilege and whether you 

393
00:20:12,211 --> 00:20:13,044
agree with trump or not,
and I don't agree with them on things 

394
00:20:14,551 --> 00:20:18,060
like torture or surveillance,
but this is the backlash.

395
00:20:18,330 --> 00:20:20,340
You know,
these people who support trump,

396
00:20:20,650 --> 00:20:21,483
uh,
so condescended towards by the 

397
00:20:23,491 --> 00:20:26,970
mainstream media,
but they had to work for everything they

398
00:20:26,971 --> 00:20:27,804
had.
These are mainly quite poor blue collar 

399
00:20:29,971 --> 00:20:32,340
workers,
the supporting trump,

400
00:20:32,610 --> 00:20:36,780
but they're sick of being made to feel 
guilty about who they are,

401
00:20:37,050 --> 00:20:41,940
but the establishment still doesn't 
recognize that fact and just labels them

402
00:20:41,941 --> 00:20:44,520
racists and bigots.
They still don't get it.

403
00:20:44,550 --> 00:20:46,920
They still don't get what's driving this
phenomenon.

404
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:48,400
And it might end up,
you know,

405
00:20:48,460 --> 00:20:49,750
slapping them in the face.

406
00:20:49,850 --> 00:20:50,690
Yeah.
Well I think it,

407
00:20:50,730 --> 00:20:51,563
it slapping them in the face right now.
So how much of this do you think his 

408
00:20:54,641 --> 00:20:55,474
establishment politicians and just the 
establishment on both the Democrats and 

409
00:20:59,441 --> 00:21:00,274
the Republicans in bed with the media,
that they've all gotten so fat for so 

410
00:21:04,181 --> 00:21:05,014
long that they've all just asked 
terrible questions and no good follow 

411
00:21:08,631 --> 00:21:12,220
ups and they've all just been in this 
game for so long that they.

412
00:21:12,221 --> 00:21:13,054
Their fear of trump is that he's going 
to leave a lot of these guys without a 

413
00:21:15,431 --> 00:21:16,264
job.
A lot of these pundits on TV and all 

414
00:21:18,161 --> 00:21:22,540
these people who have professionally 
gotten everything wrong for years,

415
00:21:23,050 --> 00:21:25,630
but they've had a gig and a lot of these
people I think think,

416
00:21:25,631 --> 00:21:26,464
Whoa,
I'm not going to have a gig if trump 

417
00:21:27,161 --> 00:21:28,340
gets in.
So they're.

418
00:21:28,341 --> 00:21:31,030
They're protecting their own assets more
than anything else.

419
00:21:32,370 --> 00:21:33,770
Well,
that's definitely part of it.

420
00:21:33,771 --> 00:21:35,750
I mean,
the other department is,

421
00:21:35,810 --> 00:21:37,610
you know,
trump is self funded.

422
00:21:37,640 --> 00:21:39,650
He's a maverick.
He might be a rich,

423
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:44,090
bigoted buffoon,
but he's unpredictable and the elite,

424
00:21:44,120 --> 00:21:44,953
the establishment of the political 
establishment is used to having not one 

425
00:21:48,201 --> 00:21:52,070
but two candidates and every single 
presidential race that they control.

426
00:21:52,370 --> 00:21:55,010
I mean,
you go back to 2004 Bush and Kerry,

427
00:21:55,310 --> 00:21:58,190
both skull and bones members.
That's,

428
00:21:58,220 --> 00:21:59,053
you know,
that's business as usual for the 

429
00:22:00,081 --> 00:22:03,110
political elite.
Somebody like trump comes along,

430
00:22:03,450 --> 00:22:05,060
he's a,
he's a loose cannon.

431
00:22:05,330 --> 00:22:07,880
He's unpredictable.
They don't know what he's going to do.

432
00:22:07,881 --> 00:22:08,714
I think if he got in power,
he would immediately start moderating 

433
00:22:11,631 --> 00:22:16,010
his rhetoric or whatever.
They're scared stiff because it's simply

434
00:22:16,011 --> 00:22:18,590
an unknown quantity.
And as you said,

435
00:22:18,591 --> 00:22:19,424
a lot of people in the establishment who
have relied on this status quo for so 

436
00:22:23,481 --> 00:22:25,040
long,
for decades,

437
00:22:25,580 --> 00:22:27,930
an hour petrified because you know,
he's,

438
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:31,010
he's come along and up the apple 
applecart people are scared.

439
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:32,193
Yeah.
So do you view this all is just a big 

440
00:22:33,981 --> 00:22:36,210
negotiating ploy with him because you 
know,

441
00:22:36,230 --> 00:22:38,870
I was seeing this week he made this 
comment that,

442
00:22:38,871 --> 00:22:39,704
you know,
maybe Japan should have nukes and 

443
00:22:41,811 --> 00:22:42,644
everyone is saying,
well then he's going to start a nuclear 

444
00:22:43,671 --> 00:22:47,030
arms race.
But what he really was saying was either

445
00:22:47,031 --> 00:22:47,864
Japan should be able to defend itself 
with nukes because North Korea is there 

446
00:22:50,421 --> 00:22:54,410
and China and everything else.
Or they should pay us to defend them,

447
00:22:54,411 --> 00:22:58,310
meaning pay the United States because we
basically have agreements that we defend

448
00:22:58,311 --> 00:22:59,144
them militarily.
So it's not that crazy of a proposal 

449
00:23:02,001 --> 00:23:03,870
that we should be paid.
You know,

450
00:23:03,890 --> 00:23:05,570
if you're a celebrity,
you pay your body guard.

451
00:23:05,571 --> 00:23:07,880
Right?
So do you think a lot of this is that he

452
00:23:07,881 --> 00:23:11,270
just throws this stuff out there,
then gets misquoted.

453
00:23:11,271 --> 00:23:12,770
You know what I mean?
The media runs with a tie.

454
00:23:12,790 --> 00:23:15,530
He really wants to start a nuclear arms 
race and then people.

455
00:23:15,531 --> 00:23:17,630
It even strengthens him more because 
then people go,

456
00:23:17,631 --> 00:23:20,870
wait a minute.
That wasn't that crazy of a proposal.

457
00:23:22,280 --> 00:23:23,113
No,
they just run with the banner headline 

458
00:23:24,501 --> 00:23:25,334
that suits their agenda and as you said,
if you actually drill down into what 

459
00:23:27,771 --> 00:23:30,110
he's saying,
sometimes it makes a lot of sense.

460
00:23:30,111 --> 00:23:30,944
Sometimes he just missed,
speaks and tylee back a few months ago 

461
00:23:34,261 --> 00:23:35,094
and he advocated bringing in Syrian 
refugees and within 24 hours completely 

462
00:23:39,231 --> 00:23:41,780
reversed his position.
So it's partly that,

463
00:23:42,050 --> 00:23:47,050
but geo politically from a geopolitical 
standpoint is better than anyone else.

464
00:23:47,311 --> 00:23:48,144
And definitely Hilary Clinton.
I mean they call it trump is laminate 

465
00:23:50,541 --> 00:23:51,374
phobic.
He's not the one who voted for a wall 

466
00:23:53,841 --> 00:23:56,780
that killed a million Muslims.
You know,

467
00:23:56,781 --> 00:23:57,614
he's not the one that supported regime 
change in Syria and Libya that led to 

468
00:24:02,001 --> 00:24:05,720
this migrant crisis in the first place.
Hillary Clinton did.

469
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:07,153
He's not the one who's amping up for 
world war three with Russia as every 

470
00:24:10,941 --> 00:24:14,450
other single gop candidate has during 
the debates.

471
00:24:14,810 --> 00:24:17,630
So if you want to talk,
I mean there's all this rhetoric about,

472
00:24:17,860 --> 00:24:18,630
you know,
trump,

473
00:24:18,630 --> 00:24:19,463
the world's going to explode the day 
trump gets into office because he's so 

474
00:24:22,701 --> 00:24:26,960
crazy and out of control.
If you actually look at his prior record

475
00:24:27,130 --> 00:24:31,130
and what he's advocating in terms of 
America's military role in the world,

476
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:35,540
it's the most peaceful,
definitely out of all the gop candidates

477
00:24:35,541 --> 00:24:39,440
and definitely over and above Hillary 
Clinton who voted for the Iraq war.

478
00:24:39,590 --> 00:24:40,161
You know,
it's funny,

479
00:24:40,161 --> 00:24:40,994
I was at a very liberal progressive la 
party this weekend and people were 

480
00:24:47,181 --> 00:24:50,510
freaking out over trump and I kept 
trying to say to them,

481
00:24:50,690 --> 00:24:52,520
guys,
if you fear trump,

482
00:24:52,521 --> 00:24:55,280
if you're a liberal or a progressive or 
anyone on the left,

483
00:24:55,580 --> 00:25:00,320
you should fear Ted Cruz far more than 
you fear Donald trump.

484
00:25:00,590 --> 00:25:03,110
But I couldn't get people to quite 
understand why.

485
00:25:03,290 --> 00:25:05,180
And I'm,
I'm sort of amazed by that.

486
00:25:06,670 --> 00:25:08,290
Well,
it's because they don't read.

487
00:25:08,291 --> 00:25:09,124
I mean not.

488
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:10,633
Hi Guys.

489
00:25:11,330 --> 00:25:12,163
They don't read beyond headlines.
And if you actually listened to trump 

490
00:25:15,510 --> 00:25:18,500
speeches,
which he rambles on for an hour or so,

491
00:25:18,501 --> 00:25:20,150
but if you actually listened to most of 
them,

492
00:25:20,630 --> 00:25:25,190
most of his speeches,
a devoted to things like trade deals,

493
00:25:25,430 --> 00:25:27,470
I mean this is why people are voting for
him.

494
00:25:27,770 --> 00:25:28,603
It's the reaction to the lost jobs,
to the ruined towns in middle America 

495
00:25:33,080 --> 00:25:33,913
because of Nafta,
because of these trade deals that have 

496
00:25:36,111 --> 00:25:39,200
screwed them over.
If you map his supporters,

497
00:25:39,380 --> 00:25:43,280
it correlates almost directly with the 
industrial,

498
00:25:43,340 --> 00:25:44,173
the industrialization and despair.
These areas of America that have been 

499
00:25:47,451 --> 00:25:48,284
completely abandoned,
completely left to rot by these trade 

500
00:25:51,531 --> 00:25:52,364
deals that have resulted in the great 
sucking sound of these jobs leaving 

501
00:25:55,701 --> 00:25:58,340
America.
So watch his speeches.

502
00:25:58,341 --> 00:25:59,174
They are liberal.
A progressive will never watch his 

503
00:26:01,221 --> 00:26:04,460
speeches.
It's not mainly about building a wall.

504
00:26:04,461 --> 00:26:08,030
It's not mainly about banning Muslims.
It's mainly about trade.

505
00:26:08,330 --> 00:26:09,163
And that's why he has a lot of support 
amongst blue collar workers because 

506
00:26:12,021 --> 00:26:15,740
people's jobs have been shipped abroad 
and they're furious about it.

507
00:26:15,741 --> 00:26:19,520
And that's mainly a left wing position 
to be complaining about.

508
00:26:19,521 --> 00:26:23,270
Life has been in the past.
So That's interesting that most liberals

509
00:26:23,271 --> 00:26:24,104
just aren't aware of the main body of 
his actual speech and why people are 

510
00:26:27,681 --> 00:26:29,060
attracted to his campaign.

511
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:31,500
Well that's like when you know,
they'll tweet out,

512
00:26:31,510 --> 00:26:32,181
they'll say,
oh look,

513
00:26:32,181 --> 00:26:34,520
trump ties are made in Mexico.
And they say,

514
00:26:34,521 --> 00:26:35,750
oh,
what a hypocrite he is.

515
00:26:36,020 --> 00:26:37,550
But that doesn't improve.
He's a hypocrite.

516
00:26:37,551 --> 00:26:38,384
That shows he's a good businessman.
He's used are shitty trade deals that 

517
00:26:42,021 --> 00:26:47,021
our politicians have signed to make 
money here and he's saying I will change

518
00:26:47,281 --> 00:26:48,114
those deals.
So people like me won't have to do that 

519
00:26:50,430 --> 00:26:52,590
somehow.
That's lost on all my liberal friends.

520
00:26:52,591 --> 00:26:54,000
No matter how many times I bring that 
up.

521
00:26:55,460 --> 00:26:57,850
Exactly.
And also what's lost,

522
00:26:58,310 --> 00:27:01,760
if you look at the lines of people going
into these trump events,

523
00:27:01,761 --> 00:27:02,594
which again,
we've had reports in Wisconsin this 

524
00:27:04,040 --> 00:27:04,821
week,
you know,

525
00:27:04,821 --> 00:27:05,654
a lot of Asian Americans,
quite a few black people in fight back 

526
00:27:08,871 --> 00:27:09,704
when Rubio was in the rice,
trump had more than double the support 

527
00:27:13,550 --> 00:27:17,720
for Muslim Americans than every other 
gop candidate combined.

528
00:27:18,020 --> 00:27:23,020
He set to break records for black votes 
to support for a Republican candidate.

529
00:27:23,510 --> 00:27:24,343
So again,
this narrative that it's just about 

530
00:27:25,820 --> 00:27:26,653
bigotry and racism is just surface crap.
You delve a little bit below and you 

531
00:27:31,371 --> 00:27:35,090
have to understand the wider phenomenon,
why he has this support.

532
00:27:35,091 --> 00:27:37,400
This is our complete political 
revolution.

533
00:27:37,670 --> 00:27:40,130
This is about an overthrow of the status
quo.

534
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:41,273
Americans are sick of it.
And now finally that putting that vote 

535
00:27:44,631 --> 00:27:46,790
behind it,
whether it be for trump or sanders.

536
00:27:46,970 --> 00:27:47,803
Yeah.
So let's move away from trump a little 

537
00:27:49,071 --> 00:27:49,904
bit.
I want to back up to something you said 

538
00:27:50,721 --> 00:27:53,090
about Hillary.
So Hillary in your eyes,

539
00:27:53,250 --> 00:27:55,670
uh,
because of obviously all the connections

540
00:27:55,671 --> 00:27:56,504
between her husband and the 
establishment connections that she's 

541
00:27:59,331 --> 00:28:00,164
been involved in this forever from being
a first lady to a senator and secretary 

542
00:28:02,481 --> 00:28:03,314
of state and all that.
She's absolutely who the establishment 

543
00:28:05,901 --> 00:28:06,471
wants.
Right?

544
00:28:06,471 --> 00:28:08,450
Do you see any wiggle room on that?

545
00:28:09,780 --> 00:28:12,940
Oh No.
Why the establishment behind Hillary?

546
00:28:12,941 --> 00:28:13,900
100 percent.
I mean,

547
00:28:13,901 --> 00:28:17,880
I went to build a Burg in a,
it was Denmark in 2014,

548
00:28:17,910 --> 00:28:19,570
Austria.
Two thousand and 50.

549
00:28:19,870 --> 00:28:23,890
And even back then we got the inside 
leak from the Bilderberg group meeting,

550
00:28:23,891 --> 00:28:28,210
which is this conference at 120 
influential bankers,

551
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:29,650
politicians,
academics,

552
00:28:30,010 --> 00:28:33,400
and even back then they had come 
together and said,

553
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:35,710
Hillary's,
I pick for 2016,

554
00:28:35,711 --> 00:28:38,320
we're going to try and defund all her 
competition.

555
00:28:38,620 --> 00:28:40,540
So years back,
Hillary was there,

556
00:28:40,541 --> 00:28:41,374
pick,
I mean,

557
00:28:41,500 --> 00:28:45,670
in 2008,
she took the fall for Obama and that was

558
00:28:45,671 --> 00:28:48,160
decided.
It's a meeting in chantilly,

559
00:28:48,370 --> 00:28:49,203
coincidentally,
the same location where the Bilderberg 

560
00:28:51,040 --> 00:28:55,540
meeting was taking place back in 2018.
So yeah,

561
00:28:55,550 --> 00:28:58,280
Hillary's been a shoe in for a long time
now for the elite.

562
00:28:58,500 --> 00:29:00,870
So where does this put sanders in your 
mind?

563
00:29:00,871 --> 00:29:03,450
Because look,
he wants a lot of the changes,

564
00:29:03,451 --> 00:29:04,440
you know,
ironically,

565
00:29:04,620 --> 00:29:07,950
sanders and trump are talking about a 
lot of the same stuff,

566
00:29:08,010 --> 00:29:08,843
right?
They both want to severely changed the 

567
00:29:10,951 --> 00:29:12,930
power structure,
changed the system,

568
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:16,170
yet their supporters seemed to 
absolutely hate each other.

569
00:29:16,380 --> 00:29:17,213
Um,
so I suspect you agree with some of the 

570
00:29:18,691 --> 00:29:20,730
heart of sanders,
just not the policy.

571
00:29:22,530 --> 00:29:23,363
I can't bring myself to agree with 
somebody who says that bread lines 

572
00:29:26,931 --> 00:29:29,570
aren't necessarily a bad thing.
I mean,

573
00:29:30,050 --> 00:29:32,930
this idea that Bernie Sanders 
supporters,

574
00:29:33,230 --> 00:29:34,063
if he loses to Hillary,
which looks like it's almost certainly 

575
00:29:36,261 --> 00:29:37,094
going to happen and then going to go and
vote for trump because he's the other 

576
00:29:40,191 --> 00:29:41,024
antiestablishment option,
I just don't buy that because for the 

577
00:29:44,201 --> 00:29:47,320
very reason you just said they 
absolutely hated each other.

578
00:29:47,770 --> 00:29:48,603
I don't think many of Bernie Sanders 
supporters a rarely jive with his 

579
00:29:52,901 --> 00:29:57,370
antiestablishment credit.
I think they jive more with this extreme

580
00:29:57,371 --> 00:30:01,300
left wing social justice warrior,
pro socialist pro,

581
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:02,193
massive welfare state position,
which I can't bring myself to agree 

582
00:30:05,621 --> 00:30:06,454
with,
but just from the behavior of his 

583
00:30:08,171 --> 00:30:09,004
supporters over the past couple of 
months has really turned me off to 

584
00:30:12,611 --> 00:30:15,680
anything that Bernie Sanders stands for.
Unfortunately.

585
00:30:15,960 --> 00:30:16,910
You know,
it's really interesting.

586
00:30:16,911 --> 00:30:17,744
I don't know that I've ever felt this 
way about a candidate and I don't even 

587
00:30:19,851 --> 00:30:20,684
know that I could have made this up,
but I like him more than I liked the 

588
00:30:24,111 --> 00:30:26,840
reasons that people are supporting him.
I think,

589
00:30:26,841 --> 00:30:29,030
and this is what I was telling Milo 
Yiannopoulos a couple of weeks ago,

590
00:30:29,390 --> 00:30:33,500
I think he himself is a decent guy,
whether I disagree with him or not,

591
00:30:33,800 --> 00:30:34,633
but the underpinnings of what he's 
bringing I think are really dangerous 

592
00:30:38,031 --> 00:30:38,864
and that's what I fear and that's a 
strange place to feel about a candidate 

593
00:30:41,930 --> 00:30:42,763
when you like them,
but you don't like what they're sort of 

594
00:30:45,291 --> 00:30:46,124
bringing along with them.
I don't know that I've ever felt that 

595
00:30:47,721 --> 00:30:48,650
way before about somebody.

596
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:50,421
Well,
no,

597
00:30:50,421 --> 00:30:53,660
and it's the same reason that the trump 
phenomenon has happened.

598
00:30:53,661 --> 00:30:55,010
I mean,
he's not,

599
00:30:55,310 --> 00:30:57,470
you can't control it.
He's a maverick.

600
00:30:57,471 --> 00:31:00,110
He's unpredictable.
They wouldn't be able to buy him off.

601
00:31:00,111 --> 00:31:03,230
So whatever his policies,
which I fundamentally disagree with,

602
00:31:03,530 --> 00:31:04,363
you still represents a threats of the 
establishment because he's an unknown 

603
00:31:07,641 --> 00:31:09,430
quantity.
So I mean that's,

604
00:31:09,470 --> 00:31:12,410
that's why sanders has paralleled the 
trump phenomenon,

605
00:31:12,770 --> 00:31:14,870
but you know,
as the way it looks now,

606
00:31:14,871 --> 00:31:18,320
he's basically no chance.
So it remains to be seen what's going to

607
00:31:18,321 --> 00:31:19,154
happen to his voters,
but I very much doubt they're going to 

608
00:31:21,771 --> 00:31:25,130
go over to trump in the kind of numbers 
that people are suggesting.

609
00:31:25,670 --> 00:31:27,600
Right.
So with the sanders people,

610
00:31:27,601 --> 00:31:28,434
my sense is that a lot of them really 
want to just burn the system down and 

611
00:31:33,421 --> 00:31:35,460
that's sort of why I can't get behind 
them because yeah,

612
00:31:35,461 --> 00:31:40,080
we have a lot of problems in America.
We've done bad things internationally.

613
00:31:40,110 --> 00:31:40,943
There's too much money in politics.
We need a fair economic system or all 

614
00:31:44,941 --> 00:31:48,660
kinds of stuff that I can get on board 
with the ideas of what he says.

615
00:31:48,990 --> 00:31:49,823
But there's still something pretty good 
here in America and I think we forget 

616
00:31:52,861 --> 00:31:53,694
that as Americans.
And that's what I fear is that these 

617
00:31:56,011 --> 00:31:59,790
people want to actually burn the system 
down and I'm afraid if you burn it down,

618
00:32:00,090 --> 00:32:00,923
what rises out of those ashes is not 
gonna be any better or at least the 

619
00:32:03,721 --> 00:32:06,060
chances of it being any better or not.
Very good.

620
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:08,193
Well,
when his support as a carrying around 

621
00:32:09,641 --> 00:32:14,641
hammer and sickle communist flags and 
talking about a socialist revolution,

622
00:32:14,951 --> 00:32:15,784
I mean that gives me the jitters.
I mean you can look at sanders 

623
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:20,080
personally,
you know,

624
00:32:20,380 --> 00:32:22,900
he didn't have a job until he was 40 
years old.

625
00:32:23,740 --> 00:32:28,720
He was basically a mom living on the 
flaws of other people's palms.

626
00:32:28,930 --> 00:32:33,400
So it's personal lifestyle kind of turns
me off towards him as well.

627
00:32:33,401 --> 00:32:35,200
But as you said,
the kind of things,

628
00:32:35,201 --> 00:32:40,201
his support as advocate or in many cases
a lot worse than what he's advocating.

629
00:32:41,150 --> 00:32:41,983
So they want to tear the system down,
but they basically want to replace it 

630
00:32:45,531 --> 00:32:48,020
with outright communism.
A lot of them,

631
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:50,030
and again,
it goes back to this,

632
00:32:50,031 --> 00:32:52,310
you know,
resist capitalism.

633
00:32:52,311 --> 00:32:54,740
Hashtag that was on twitter a couple of 
months ago.

634
00:32:55,100 --> 00:32:56,420
These people are,
you know,

635
00:32:56,421 --> 00:33:00,670
they're probably aged 20 to 30.
They've got no idea whatsoever.

636
00:33:01,040 --> 00:33:05,990
The absolute horror that communism has 
role on the world over the last 50,

637
00:33:05,991 --> 00:33:08,210
60 years.
And we keep having to,

638
00:33:08,570 --> 00:33:09,403
you know,
have that debate over and over again of 

639
00:33:11,271 --> 00:33:16,070
why communism is bad and why leaving 
people to their own devices and building

640
00:33:16,071 --> 00:33:16,904
a free market economy is good because 
there's this fundamental ignorance 

641
00:33:20,811 --> 00:33:21,644
surrounding capitalism.
People think that the system of 

642
00:33:24,291 --> 00:33:27,230
capitalism we've got now is free market 
capitalism.

643
00:33:27,520 --> 00:33:31,310
It isn't,
it's corporatism crony capitalism,

644
00:33:31,550 --> 00:33:33,920
but they think that that's free market 
capitalism,

645
00:33:34,190 --> 00:33:38,210
which is why they go to the extreme 
other end of the equation and think that

646
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:42,350
communism is the solution.
When history has proven that it's not,

647
00:33:42,530 --> 00:33:43,363
we keep having to recycle that argument 
over and over again because a lot of 

648
00:33:47,031 --> 00:33:49,490
these millennials just don't know the 
history,

649
00:33:49,530 --> 00:33:50,363
right?
So instead of detangling some of the 

650
00:33:52,051 --> 00:33:55,560
crony capitalism and some of the Wall 
Street money and all that stuff,

651
00:33:55,740 --> 00:33:58,020
which he talks about,
which is extremely legit,

652
00:33:58,320 --> 00:33:59,153
they go,
we're going to burn the whole thing 

653
00:33:59,551 --> 00:34:00,840
down.
We're going to become communists,

654
00:34:00,841 --> 00:34:01,890
which is crazy.
All right,

655
00:34:01,891 --> 00:34:02,724
so a lot of the Bernie support is 
obviously a mixed with the black lives 

656
00:34:07,621 --> 00:34:09,230
matter support.
And,

657
00:34:09,290 --> 00:34:10,620
you know,
one of the things I've been saying about

658
00:34:10,621 --> 00:34:11,454
the black lives matter movement is their
intentions are good and somehow what's 

659
00:34:15,091 --> 00:34:18,960
happened to the movement seems to have 
been hijacked or derailed by,

660
00:34:18,961 --> 00:34:21,000
I think,
what you would call far leftists.

661
00:34:21,240 --> 00:34:22,073
Um,
do you agree with that or do you think 

662
00:34:23,701 --> 00:34:26,010
the movement was always that way?
Where do you see it now?

663
00:34:26,011 --> 00:34:26,844
Where do you see it going?

664
00:34:28,570 --> 00:34:29,403
Well,
I mean,

665
00:34:29,420 --> 00:34:32,570
back in 2013,
2014,

666
00:34:32,930 --> 00:34:37,100
myself and Info wars were on the 
forefront of exposing police brutality.

667
00:34:37,101 --> 00:34:42,101
I mean probably 25 percent of my content
every day was about police brutality.

668
00:34:43,430 --> 00:34:44,263
Now that,
that whole narrative has been hijacked 

669
00:34:45,981 --> 00:34:46,814
by black lives matter.
It makes you less enthusiastic to 

670
00:34:50,301 --> 00:34:53,870
actually talk about police brutality,
the effect that they've had.

671
00:34:54,290 --> 00:34:55,123
And the polls show this is massive 
support for police departments across 

672
00:34:59,031 --> 00:34:59,864
the United States because the tactics 
that they engage in a so divisive and 

673
00:35:04,791 --> 00:35:05,624
turn ordinary Americans off to such a 
degree that now a lot of people simply 

674
00:35:09,891 --> 00:35:10,724
would immediately support the police 
even in a flagrant case of police 

675
00:35:13,911 --> 00:35:16,300
brutality.
So you know,

676
00:35:16,310 --> 00:35:17,143
yeah,
you have to go back to the founding of 

677
00:35:18,171 --> 00:35:19,004
black lives matter,
obviously a lot of well meaning people 

678
00:35:21,231 --> 00:35:23,630
jumped on board in the first six months 
or so,

679
00:35:24,200 --> 00:35:27,350
but the inspiration behind black lives 
matter,

680
00:35:27,650 --> 00:35:28,483
and this is the woman that the three 
female founders of that embryonic group 

681
00:35:32,630 --> 00:35:36,940
said was their inspiration,
was a woman named the softer Chicago.

682
00:35:37,620 --> 00:35:38,453
Now she's on the FBI's most wanted 
terrorist list because she killed a cop 

683
00:35:43,651 --> 00:35:47,790
in New Jersey back in the seventies and 
then fled to Cuba.

684
00:35:48,120 --> 00:35:49,450
This is a woman who's,
you know,

685
00:35:49,590 --> 00:35:50,423
black lives matter activists.
They invoke her name at nearly every 

686
00:35:53,401 --> 00:35:54,234
rally.
She's a domestic terrorist who left the 

687
00:35:57,930 --> 00:36:00,240
Black Panther party because it wasn't 
violent enough.

688
00:36:00,570 --> 00:36:03,060
She joined the Black Liberation Army.
You know,

689
00:36:03,061 --> 00:36:03,894
this was another domestic terror group 
that was involved in bombings and 

690
00:36:06,841 --> 00:36:08,910
assassinations,
killing police officers.

691
00:36:09,240 --> 00:36:13,740
So when you have that kind of guru,
that inspiration behind the movement,

692
00:36:14,100 --> 00:36:16,830
obviously it's going to tend towards 
violence.

693
00:36:17,190 --> 00:36:18,023
You had black lives matter protesters in
New York walking down the street 

694
00:36:22,321 --> 00:36:24,060
chanting,
what do we want?

695
00:36:24,120 --> 00:36:26,040
Dead Cops.
When do we want them?

696
00:36:26,041 --> 00:36:26,874
Now?
That's the only going to turn people 

697
00:36:28,501 --> 00:36:31,740
away from your movement.
So it's not an inclusive movement.

698
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:32,993
It's been a divisive movement since 
almost the beginning since just after 

699
00:36:37,231 --> 00:36:38,064
the first ferguson protests and it's 
only got worse as it's been hijacked by 

700
00:36:42,571 --> 00:36:44,610
all these opportunists and operatives.

701
00:36:44,810 --> 00:36:45,870
Yeah.
So for you,

702
00:36:45,871 --> 00:36:46,704
as you said,
you guys were ahead on this stuff and I 

703
00:36:48,361 --> 00:36:49,194
remember seeing a lot of videos that you
guys were doing where you were talking 

704
00:36:52,201 --> 00:36:53,034
about police brutality before it had 
really bubbled up into the mainstream 

705
00:36:56,251 --> 00:36:57,084
news,
so it must be extremely depressing for 

706
00:36:58,621 --> 00:37:01,680
you as someone that is in this and you 
talk about this,

707
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:02,753
you understand that there was something 
good here and as you just laid out that 

708
00:37:05,971 --> 00:37:07,860
it has been derailed.
How do you,

709
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:10,530
how do you get it back to that is,
is it too late?

710
00:37:10,531 --> 00:37:11,364
Is the.
Is the wave already gone to to get it 

711
00:37:13,801 --> 00:37:14,634
back to what was right?
Dealing with legit issues about police 

712
00:37:17,221 --> 00:37:18,054
brutality?

713
00:37:19,060 --> 00:37:22,870
Well,
when the entire movement Blm was founded

714
00:37:22,871 --> 00:37:23,704
on this Michael Brown case,
the whole hands up don't shoot mess and 

715
00:37:27,970 --> 00:37:31,120
the media pedaled that for six months or
more,

716
00:37:31,270 --> 00:37:32,103
the autopsy,
of course it turned out that was 

717
00:37:33,731 --> 00:37:36,180
complete bs.
He never had his hands are,

718
00:37:36,460 --> 00:37:37,293
so they base all their grievances on 
these completely fraudulent cases and 

719
00:37:41,201 --> 00:37:44,130
then you have a case like Eric Garner,
which was a,

720
00:37:44,150 --> 00:37:46,540
you know,
a legitimate acts of police brutality,

721
00:37:46,541 --> 00:37:49,450
which we support the victim in that 
case,

722
00:37:49,750 --> 00:37:50,583
but they tend to base all their 
grievances on these ridiculous cases 

723
00:37:54,130 --> 00:37:57,760
that are obviously justified use of 
force by the police.

724
00:37:58,300 --> 00:38:01,210
So it's difficult to see how we're going
to get back to,

725
00:38:01,211 --> 00:38:02,044
uh,
a rational conversation about it when 

726
00:38:04,151 --> 00:38:05,620
these people are,
you know,

727
00:38:05,621 --> 00:38:09,280
invoking the inspiration,
the guru or the domestic terrorists,

728
00:38:09,281 --> 00:38:11,710
they're chanting for dead cops.
You know,

729
00:38:11,711 --> 00:38:15,580
you had people planned to bomb the 
Ferguson police station.

730
00:38:15,790 --> 00:38:20,050
You had the cops that were killed in New
York as part of a black lives matter,

731
00:38:20,230 --> 00:38:21,063
revenge attack by Ishmael Brinsley.
So when it attracts those kinds of 

732
00:38:24,701 --> 00:38:26,320
extremists,
I mean at this point,

733
00:38:26,740 --> 00:38:27,573
I call it a domestic hate group,
if this was a bunch of why Oregon 

734
00:38:31,271 --> 00:38:32,104
militia members who were chanting for 
black cops to killed black people to be 

735
00:38:36,431 --> 00:38:37,264
killed,
who some of them were actually planning 

736
00:38:38,801 --> 00:38:42,340
to do that and who's ideological 
inspiration was?

737
00:38:42,850 --> 00:38:46,630
Timothy Mcveigh for example,
the media wouldn't get behind that,

738
00:38:46,750 --> 00:38:49,960
but we've seen elements of the media get
behind black lives matter.

739
00:38:49,961 --> 00:38:51,040
We've seen,
you know,

740
00:38:51,041 --> 00:38:54,070
Time magazine,
Time magazine in defense of rioting.

741
00:38:54,520 --> 00:38:56,620
So they built this whole grievance 
industry.

742
00:38:56,621 --> 00:38:57,454
It was supported by some elements of the
this media and now you've got Hillary 

743
00:39:02,230 --> 00:39:03,063
Clinton meeting with black lives,
meet a is back a few months ago saying 

744
00:39:06,190 --> 00:39:07,023
she's prepared to change laws for them.
I think this is very divisive 

745
00:39:10,931 --> 00:39:11,764
destructive movement and it's 
de-legitimized genuine opposition to 

746
00:39:15,791 --> 00:39:16,624
police brutality,
which was an su and continues to be an 

747
00:39:18,761 --> 00:39:21,430
Su,
but now people are so turned off towards

748
00:39:21,431 --> 00:39:22,840
that.
As I said,

749
00:39:22,841 --> 00:39:25,720
the polls show that people don't like 
black lives matter.

750
00:39:25,721 --> 00:39:27,850
They're now more likely to support 
police.

751
00:39:27,980 --> 00:39:28,740
Yeah.
You know,

752
00:39:28,740 --> 00:39:31,860
a perfect example of that would be sort 
of what you alluded to,

753
00:39:31,861 --> 00:39:32,694
which is what happened in Oregon here,
what two months ago when you know the 

754
00:39:35,640 --> 00:39:36,473
cliven Bundy people,
they took over basically a vacant lot 

755
00:39:41,070 --> 00:39:41,903
house office and everyone I saw,
all my progressive friends were 

756
00:39:45,931 --> 00:39:48,570
screaming about what terrorists they are
domestic terrorists.

757
00:39:48,780 --> 00:39:51,030
I'm not defending them.
They walked into a federal building.

758
00:39:51,031 --> 00:39:51,864
Even if nobody was there in the door,
was unlocked with weapons and I think 

759
00:39:54,121 --> 00:39:57,690
maybe one person did die somehow related
to it or something that.

760
00:39:57,691 --> 00:39:58,890
You could correct me if I'm wrong on 
that,

761
00:39:59,730 --> 00:40:04,730
but there was such outrage over that 
where there was virtually no violence.

762
00:40:05,190 --> 00:40:06,023
I'm not defending everything that they 
did versus the lack of outrage when 

763
00:40:10,021 --> 00:40:10,854
there's actual violence.
So everything comes down to race at the 

764
00:40:13,860 --> 00:40:14,910
end of the day with the progresses.
Right.

765
00:40:16,220 --> 00:40:16,960
Well,
yeah,

766
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:17,793
that was a.
That was a young guy hold up there in 

767
00:40:19,161 --> 00:40:20,780
the,
in the wildlife center,

768
00:40:20,781 --> 00:40:21,614
right at the end of that situation who 
was threatening to kill himself and it 

769
00:40:25,220 --> 00:40:27,440
was being broadcast live on the 
Internet.

770
00:40:27,441 --> 00:40:29,480
It was [inaudible].
It was a tragic situation,

771
00:40:29,690 --> 00:40:31,670
but on twitter you had all the 
regressive,

772
00:40:31,671 --> 00:40:32,504
celebrating it,
calling him a racist and saying you 

773
00:40:34,941 --> 00:40:35,774
should shoot himself in the head.
You hadn't Lavoy finicum who was in the 

774
00:40:38,721 --> 00:40:43,700
vehicle with a couple of these other 
protests as females traveling through.

775
00:40:43,701 --> 00:40:46,340
They say FBI roadblock.
He gets out of the car,

776
00:40:46,610 --> 00:40:50,930
he gets gunned down.
God knows two dozen times or whatever.

777
00:40:51,140 --> 00:40:53,720
That was a shady situation,
but again,

778
00:40:53,721 --> 00:40:56,270
as you said,
a complete lack of outrage.

779
00:40:56,480 --> 00:40:58,860
They filled the car with bullets.
It's a.

780
00:40:59,040 --> 00:40:59,873
it's a surprise that these are the women
who were unarmed and we're not showing 

781
00:41:02,631 --> 00:41:05,510
any resistance,
didn't get slaughtered themselves,

782
00:41:05,511 --> 00:41:10,490
but on the left there was no outrage 
whatsoever because they weren't black.

783
00:41:10,530 --> 00:41:11,363
I think we should treat everybody who's 
a victim of police brutality the same 

784
00:41:15,020 --> 00:41:17,780
regardless of race,
but because they don't do that,

785
00:41:17,960 --> 00:41:18,793
it turns white middle class America away
from their movement and it prevents us 

786
00:41:22,881 --> 00:41:27,380
from becoming truly united and 
addressing police brutality.

787
00:41:27,550 --> 00:41:29,020
Yeah,
I mean that's it right there.

788
00:41:29,021 --> 00:41:33,830
There are unintended consequences of 
what they do actually drive drive people

789
00:41:33,831 --> 00:41:36,440
the other way.
What would you say to.

790
00:41:36,441 --> 00:41:38,330
I have progressive friends,
most of them,

791
00:41:38,331 --> 00:41:39,740
well,
most of them are talk to me anymore,

792
00:41:39,741 --> 00:41:41,990
but I had progressive friends that when 
we,

793
00:41:42,020 --> 00:41:44,360
when we discuss this stuff,
they would say,

794
00:41:44,361 --> 00:41:45,770
well,
a certain amount of violence.

795
00:41:45,771 --> 00:41:46,604
If you really want social change,
a certain amount of violence is 

796
00:41:48,891 --> 00:41:49,724
necessary.
Do you buy that at all or do you think 

797
00:41:52,221 --> 00:41:55,580
that's just an excuse because look,
you're not going to get headlines If,

798
00:41:55,680 --> 00:41:57,440
if there isn't a certain amount of 
violence,

799
00:41:57,441 --> 00:41:59,270
right?
If you just have a peaceful protest,

800
00:41:59,540 --> 00:42:00,560
the media doesn't show up.

801
00:42:02,110 --> 00:42:02,943
Well,
I believe in nonviolent civil 

802
00:42:03,931 --> 00:42:04,741
disobedience.
I mean,

803
00:42:04,741 --> 00:42:08,010
if you look at everyone throughout 
history who actually change society,

804
00:42:08,011 --> 00:42:10,680
if you look at it,
you know Gandhi or Martin Luther King,

805
00:42:10,890 --> 00:42:11,723
who now the progressives are trying to 
disavow because he wasn't inclusive of 

806
00:42:14,821 --> 00:42:15,654
transgender people,
then you don't need the results of 

807
00:42:18,661 --> 00:42:21,090
violence because that causes powerful 
enough.

808
00:42:21,690 --> 00:42:23,880
When people become a threat to the 
establishment.

809
00:42:23,881 --> 00:42:27,420
When the united black people,
when are unite white people,

810
00:42:27,421 --> 00:42:30,210
when they unite people from different 
political persuasions,

811
00:42:30,540 --> 00:42:31,373
they don't become a threat when they 
results of violence because they can be 

812
00:42:34,081 --> 00:42:37,860
easily demonized,
dealt with by the state.

813
00:42:37,890 --> 00:42:40,590
So no,
I don't think that's a terrible idea.

814
00:42:40,591 --> 00:42:42,120
I think it's going to be unsuccessful.

815
00:42:42,200 --> 00:42:43,033
Yeah.
And it's also directly linked into why 

816
00:42:45,140 --> 00:42:47,900
these regressives and now we can get 
into the regressives.

817
00:42:47,930 --> 00:42:51,260
Somehow we did 45 minutes.
We barely said the word progressive,

818
00:42:51,460 --> 00:42:54,590
uh,
why they label everyone you me,

819
00:42:54,591 --> 00:42:58,160
everybody else as bigots and racists and
everything else because they are,

820
00:42:58,190 --> 00:42:59,023
they can't control people without 
splitting us all down into the little 

821
00:43:02,661 --> 00:43:03,494
racial markers or you know,
this one's oppressed more than the know 

822
00:43:06,460 --> 00:43:08,120
the,
as somebody keeps saying the,

823
00:43:08,121 --> 00:43:10,190
uh,
the oppression Olympics basically.

824
00:43:10,191 --> 00:43:11,024
So let's talk about the regressives.
Was your wake up to them at the exact 

825
00:43:15,531 --> 00:43:19,790
same time as you sort of woke up to the 
social justice warrior stuff?

826
00:43:19,970 --> 00:43:20,803
Or did it come a little bit after that?
When you really saw that there was this 

827
00:43:23,481 --> 00:43:24,314
group of people that was,
was protecting and pushing this 

828
00:43:28,041 --> 00:43:28,874
ideology?

829
00:43:30,210 --> 00:43:31,043
Well,
it probably correlates with the rise of 

830
00:43:33,081 --> 00:43:33,914
Isis with these terrorist attacks in 
Europe with the migrant crisis and the 

831
00:43:38,611 --> 00:43:42,600
fight that we're importing people from 
bad cultures and I mean that's the heart

832
00:43:42,601 --> 00:43:43,434
of regressive.
You itself proclaimed liberals who 

833
00:43:46,440 --> 00:43:47,273
defend and tolerate non liberal 
ideologies and I think because at their 

834
00:43:52,531 --> 00:43:54,450
heart,
their cultural relativist,

835
00:43:54,451 --> 00:43:55,284
right?
They believe that all cultures are 

836
00:43:57,271 --> 00:43:58,290
equal.
Well,

837
00:43:58,291 --> 00:43:59,124
I don't believe that.
I think there are bad cultures and good 

838
00:44:01,291 --> 00:44:03,390
cultures.
I made a video a few days ago.

839
00:44:03,570 --> 00:44:04,403
Some cultures are better than others,
but at the heart of progressivism is 

840
00:44:08,671 --> 00:44:09,504
this idea of utopianism,
so there can't be such a thing as a bad 

841
00:44:13,771 --> 00:44:17,970
culture accepting the fact that there 
are bad cultures,

842
00:44:18,240 --> 00:44:20,130
demolishes,
utopianism,

843
00:44:20,490 --> 00:44:21,323
so that's why progressive so cold 
progressive's column entertain the fact 

844
00:44:24,781 --> 00:44:27,030
that there are bad cultures.
Even for a second,

845
00:44:27,510 --> 00:44:29,520
even though that blatantly off.
I mean,

846
00:44:29,521 --> 00:44:30,354
you know,
when US troops blew the whistle on how 

847
00:44:32,911 --> 00:44:33,744
Afghan police officers,
we're bringing young boys onto the army 

848
00:44:36,871 --> 00:44:37,704
base and raping them and they were told 
to shut up about it because that was 

849
00:44:42,360 --> 00:44:43,770
part of their culture.

850
00:44:44,280 --> 00:44:45,113
I think that's a bad culture.
You know when UNICEF has to do pr 

851
00:44:48,871 --> 00:44:53,130
campaigns to educate 600 million 
Indians,

852
00:44:53,131 --> 00:44:53,964
half of their population,
not to deprecate in the street because 

853
00:44:57,601 --> 00:45:00,930
it's causing deadly infections and child
malnutrition.

854
00:45:01,230 --> 00:45:05,490
That's a bad culture.
We need to call out bad cultures because

855
00:45:05,491 --> 00:45:06,324
I don't think importing them into the 
West is compatible with western ideals 

856
00:45:11,430 --> 00:45:12,091
of,
you know,

857
00:45:12,091 --> 00:45:16,020
liberal tolerance,
but the regressives can't entertain that

858
00:45:16,021 --> 00:45:16,854
for a second because their cultural 
relativists they can't entertain the 

859
00:45:21,181 --> 00:45:24,540
notion that some cultures are better 
than others,

860
00:45:24,810 --> 00:45:25,643
which is why in Germany for example,
these migrants that came in and started 

861
00:45:30,220 --> 00:45:34,470
deprecating and hot tubs,
started masturbating in swimming pools,

862
00:45:34,650 --> 00:45:38,190
started raping children in swimming 
pools.

863
00:45:38,520 --> 00:45:43,520
One of the swimming pools in Germany 
responded by banning male migrants.

864
00:45:43,890 --> 00:45:46,380
How did the regressive left respond to 
that?

865
00:45:46,620 --> 00:45:48,600
They complain.
They said it was racist.

866
00:45:48,870 --> 00:45:49,703
They intimidated.
They forced the swimming pool into 

867
00:45:51,661 --> 00:45:52,494
lifting the ban because again,
they can't entertain the notion that 

868
00:45:56,461 --> 00:46:00,930
some cultures are worse than others and 
that's the heart of regressives.

869
00:46:00,980 --> 00:46:05,730
It's this utopian idea that everybody's 
the same and everybody's equal.

870
00:46:05,970 --> 00:46:06,803
Even though this is bad behavior that we
shouldn't be accepting and embracing in 

871
00:46:10,831 --> 00:46:11,250
the west.

872
00:46:11,250 --> 00:46:13,140
Yeah,
and there's really no end to it.

873
00:46:13,141 --> 00:46:13,974
Right.
That's why this snake will eventually 

874
00:46:15,540 --> 00:46:17,510
eat its tail because,
you know,

875
00:46:17,520 --> 00:46:19,950
if you look what happened in Germany,
uh,

876
00:46:20,210 --> 00:46:21,870
you know,
right on New Year's with,

877
00:46:21,871 --> 00:46:24,780
with all the rapes and all the sexual 
attacks on women,

878
00:46:25,110 --> 00:46:30,090
suddenly all the regressives we're 
defending basically the perpetrators,

879
00:46:30,091 --> 00:46:32,490
they kept saying not all Muslims,
all this stuff.

880
00:46:32,520 --> 00:46:33,353
Nobody was saying all Muslims.
People were saying the specific people 

881
00:46:35,671 --> 00:46:39,930
here who did this,
they have these set of values.

882
00:46:39,931 --> 00:46:42,540
They're the ones that did it.
That's what a rational person would say.

883
00:46:42,720 --> 00:46:43,553
We didn't say this is condemning every 
single person that believes in this and 

884
00:46:48,091 --> 00:46:51,090
yet they go to defend that.
So they throw women under the bus.

885
00:46:51,240 --> 00:46:52,073
So it's like they have their pecking 
order and in this case women came below 

886
00:46:56,370 --> 00:46:59,130
the migrants because the migrants are 
mostly Muslim.

887
00:47:00,290 --> 00:47:01,440
Yeah.
That whole oppression,

888
00:47:01,441 --> 00:47:04,900
Olympics idea.
And when it came out in Cologne,

889
00:47:04,901 --> 00:47:05,734
it later emerged that most of the 
perpetrators were not newly arrived 

890
00:47:09,061 --> 00:47:09,894
refugees.
They were migrants who had been there 

891
00:47:11,761 --> 00:47:13,830
for several years and they're 
aggressive.

892
00:47:13,850 --> 00:47:14,780
Celebrates.

893
00:47:16,220 --> 00:47:17,053
Yeah.

894
00:47:17,790 --> 00:47:22,440
How dare you demonize the refugees.
This was done by migrants.

895
00:47:22,770 --> 00:47:23,603
Okay.
So migrants who were supposedly 

896
00:47:24,670 --> 00:47:25,503
assimilated,
they've been there for years and yet 

897
00:47:27,750 --> 00:47:28,583
this is the kind of behavior they're 
engaging in and that's something to 

898
00:47:31,211 --> 00:47:32,890
celebrate.
I mean,

899
00:47:32,891 --> 00:47:35,100
that's again,
that shines light on the heart,

900
00:47:35,250 --> 00:47:37,180
progressivism,
and as he said,

901
00:47:37,181 --> 00:47:39,250
you know,
after every single terror attack,

902
00:47:39,460 --> 00:47:42,850
we hear the same thing again and again,
don't blame Islam.

903
00:47:43,030 --> 00:47:47,410
Not all Muslims are terrorists.
Nobody ever suggested that.

904
00:47:47,620 --> 00:47:48,453
That's never been part of the debate.
They try and frame the debate so it 

905
00:47:52,061 --> 00:47:56,170
becomes that because they can't win when
you actually drill down,

906
00:47:56,300 --> 00:47:57,133
you know,
into the statistics and show that this 

907
00:47:59,710 --> 00:48:00,543
isn't a tiny minority of people.
This is what I bang on about again and 

908
00:48:04,541 --> 00:48:05,111
again,
you know,

909
00:48:05,111 --> 00:48:08,320
I make videos saying Islam is not 
religion of peace.

910
00:48:08,650 --> 00:48:10,840
Get death threats as a result of it.

911
00:48:11,020 --> 00:48:13,090
I guess to prove that it isn't a 
religion of peace,

912
00:48:13,600 --> 00:48:15,430
but I mean you can look at the 
statistics.

913
00:48:15,431 --> 00:48:19,930
This is not a tiny minority of people.
This is a problem within Islam.

914
00:48:19,931 --> 00:48:24,190
This is why we need to support the 
voices of reform within Islam.

915
00:48:24,370 --> 00:48:26,440
So Pew had a poll,
for example,

916
00:48:26,980 --> 00:48:27,813
the percentage of Muslims who think that
suicide bombings are justified under 

917
00:48:31,541 --> 00:48:32,374
some circumstances.
They asked Muslims in European 

918
00:48:34,751 --> 00:48:36,490
countries,
so in France,

919
00:48:36,760 --> 00:48:41,270
31 percent of adult Muslims over the age
of 30.

920
00:48:41,271 --> 00:48:43,900
You think that suicide bombings or 
sometimes justify,

921
00:48:44,170 --> 00:48:47,110
if you look at young people aged 18 to 
29,

922
00:48:47,350 --> 00:48:52,350
that goes up to 42 percent think that 
suicide bombings or sometimes justify,

923
00:48:52,690 --> 00:48:56,470
and it's similar in Spain,
22 percent of adults think the same.

924
00:48:56,860 --> 00:48:57,693
Germany,
10 percent and 22 percent of those aged 

925
00:49:00,640 --> 00:49:04,990
18 to 29 think that suicide bombings or 
justify.

926
00:49:05,290 --> 00:49:09,100
You've also got huge numbers of Muslims 
throughout your trip.

927
00:49:09,650 --> 00:49:10,483
In France for example,
27 percent of Muslims aged 18 to 24 

928
00:49:15,521 --> 00:49:17,350
support isis.
So again,

929
00:49:17,530 --> 00:49:20,440
this is not a tiny fringe minority of 
people.

930
00:49:20,650 --> 00:49:23,410
Twenty one percent of Syrian support 
Isis.

931
00:49:23,800 --> 00:49:26,260
These are the people who were bringing 
in.

932
00:49:26,590 --> 00:49:30,000
So it's this lie that the Islamophobia 
industry upholds the.

933
00:49:30,050 --> 00:49:31,180
It's just a,
you know,

934
00:49:31,181 --> 00:49:33,580
a tiny fringe minority.
It isn't.

935
00:49:33,640 --> 00:49:36,070
And the facts,
the stats prove that.

936
00:49:36,230 --> 00:49:37,063
Yeah.
What do you think of the Word 

937
00:49:37,911 --> 00:49:38,744
Islamophobia?
I assume you're not a fan of the word 

938
00:49:40,221 --> 00:49:40,881
itself.
I think it's.

939
00:49:40,881 --> 00:49:43,610
It's an imaginary world.
You can't fear a set of ideas.

940
00:49:43,700 --> 00:49:46,100
You can fear actions that people might 
do,

941
00:49:46,280 --> 00:49:47,113
and Islam itself says a lot of bad 
things about infidel is like a the two 

942
00:49:50,811 --> 00:49:51,644
of us.
Right?

943
00:49:51,710 --> 00:49:55,370
So it's not an irrational fear to fear 
this set of ideas.

944
00:49:55,371 --> 00:49:56,750
It's just,
this is just a made up word,

945
00:49:56,751 --> 00:49:57,584
right?
That doesn't discount that there might 

946
00:49:58,401 --> 00:50:03,401
be bigotry towards Muslim people,
but the word itself is a slippery slope.

947
00:50:03,621 --> 00:50:04,454
Right?

948
00:50:04,710 --> 00:50:07,860
Well,
it's become interchangeable with racist,

949
00:50:07,861 --> 00:50:08,820
doesn't it?
I mean,

950
00:50:08,821 --> 00:50:09,654
at this point,
the Islamophobia industry is bolstered 

951
00:50:12,961 --> 00:50:14,970
and exaggerate it to such an extent.
I mean,

952
00:50:15,360 --> 00:50:16,193
there are Islamophobic attacks and 
they're horrible and we shouldn't cry 

953
00:50:18,541 --> 00:50:20,580
them,
but it's presented.

954
00:50:20,810 --> 00:50:22,550
Those are anti Muslim attacks,
right?

955
00:50:22,551 --> 00:50:24,740
Not,
not Islamophobic attacks.

956
00:50:24,980 --> 00:50:25,813
Right.
They're not afraid of the idea of 

957
00:50:27,291 --> 00:50:29,600
something they're.
They're afraid of the people.

958
00:50:29,810 --> 00:50:30,643
Right?

959
00:50:31,120 --> 00:50:31,730
Yeah.
That was.

960
00:50:31,730 --> 00:50:32,563
That was a basically racist attacks.
But if you look at actual hate crimes 

961
00:50:35,530 --> 00:50:38,970
that far outweighed by antisemitic 
attacks,

962
00:50:38,971 --> 00:50:41,640
for example,
in in most western countries.

963
00:50:41,850 --> 00:50:42,683
So I think that's exaggerated.
We saw that again in molenbeek just the 

964
00:50:45,811 --> 00:50:50,811
other day where the media reported that 
a right wing protests had run over.

965
00:50:50,941 --> 00:50:55,941
A Muslim woman later turned out that it 
was a Muslim teen from molenbeek who ran

966
00:50:56,431 --> 00:50:59,250
over the Muslim woman.
So there are these,

967
00:50:59,280 --> 00:51:00,113
these fake Islamophobic attacks.
It was another one on Wall Street where 

968
00:51:03,040 --> 00:51:05,820
a Muslim woman says she was slashed 
across the face.

969
00:51:05,970 --> 00:51:09,060
Then Islamophobic attacks turned out.
It was completely made of.

970
00:51:09,450 --> 00:51:12,300
So again,
you know this point,

971
00:51:12,301 --> 00:51:14,370
why not own it?
Why not say yes?

972
00:51:14,460 --> 00:51:17,910
I'm afraid of an ideology that supports 
Sharia law,

973
00:51:17,911 --> 00:51:22,740
that supports stoning women to death,
executing homosexuals killing people who

974
00:51:22,741 --> 00:51:24,780
leave the faith of Islam.
Yes,

975
00:51:24,840 --> 00:51:29,840
I'm very afraid of importing those kinds
of ideas into the west and when,

976
00:51:30,420 --> 00:51:31,253
for example,
50 percent of Muslims of American 

977
00:51:34,200 --> 00:51:39,200
Muslims support the right to live under 
Sharia law in the United States.

978
00:51:39,480 --> 00:51:40,313
That's a problem.
And I'm going to call attention to that 

979
00:51:42,511 --> 00:51:45,030
figure because it's,
it's way too high.

980
00:51:45,300 --> 00:51:48,210
And to call attention to that figure is 
not to be Islamophobic,

981
00:51:48,510 --> 00:51:49,343
it's to be rightly concerned about these
intolerant beliefs being imported into 

982
00:51:53,671 --> 00:51:56,280
the west as they now are in such great 
numbers.

983
00:51:56,430 --> 00:51:57,263
So for people like us that want to have 
honest discussions about this without 

984
00:52:01,351 --> 00:52:02,184
bigotry and without hyperbole,
and I know it's very hard to do and we 

985
00:52:05,251 --> 00:52:07,500
don't win any points for doing this 
really,

986
00:52:07,770 --> 00:52:10,380
but for people like us and I know it's a
growing movement,

987
00:52:11,130 --> 00:52:16,020
should we start thinking of Islam more 
as a political ideology than a religion?

988
00:52:16,050 --> 00:52:16,883
Because people,
no matter how many times we separate 

989
00:52:18,840 --> 00:52:21,510
ideas versus people religion first 
people,

990
00:52:21,600 --> 00:52:23,580
people can't seem to do it.
They just.

991
00:52:23,650 --> 00:52:27,450
There's a certain amount of people,
they cannot detangle these two things.

992
00:52:27,720 --> 00:52:28,553
But I'm starting to think that if we 
start describing these actions as 

993
00:52:32,371 --> 00:52:34,260
political actions,
killing gays,

994
00:52:34,261 --> 00:52:35,930
not good.
You know what I mean?

995
00:52:35,940 --> 00:52:39,000
A oppressing women not good.
If these were political,

996
00:52:39,060 --> 00:52:41,370
a political party was pushing these 
ideas,

997
00:52:41,550 --> 00:52:45,230
the left would be completely against it.
So is that sort of how we have to.

998
00:52:45,240 --> 00:52:47,460
Not to give up our tactics publicly 
right now,

999
00:52:47,610 --> 00:52:50,340
but is that how we have to start 
focusing on this argument?

1000
00:52:51,790 --> 00:52:53,270
I think it is exactly.
I mean,

1001
00:52:53,420 --> 00:52:54,253
you know,
Sam Harris Majeed was dave outline the 

1002
00:52:56,001 --> 00:52:59,060
fact that this is not just jihad is the 
problem,

1003
00:52:59,061 --> 00:53:00,620
isn't just jihadist.
Yes,

1004
00:53:00,621 --> 00:53:03,680
you can point to that and say that's a 
tiny minority,

1005
00:53:03,920 --> 00:53:07,130
but the main problem is Islam is,
you know,

1006
00:53:07,131 --> 00:53:12,131
I agreed with Obama when he said 
terrorism is not an existential threat.

1007
00:53:12,770 --> 00:53:13,603
I mean we're not going to all be killed 
by terrorists is not going to be such a 

1008
00:53:16,371 --> 00:53:17,780
massive,
you know,

1009
00:53:17,781 --> 00:53:20,960
onset of terrorist attacks that it 
proves an existential threat.

1010
00:53:21,170 --> 00:53:25,040
But when you import these ideas that are
incompatible with western,

1011
00:53:25,980 --> 00:53:28,620
then that's a direct why quality of 
life,

1012
00:53:28,650 --> 00:53:29,483
our culture and the entire underpinnings
of Western society as a free liberal 

1013
00:53:34,681 --> 00:53:38,460
tolerant society.
So we have to emphasize that distinction

1014
00:53:38,780 --> 00:53:41,670
that there are not just jihadist Islam 
Miss.

1015
00:53:41,880 --> 00:53:45,870
I mean look at deadline there in 
molenbeek and Brussels.

1016
00:53:46,110 --> 00:53:46,943
He was protected for months after the 
Paris massacre by his friends and 

1017
00:53:51,721 --> 00:53:53,130
neighbors.
Okay.

1018
00:53:53,131 --> 00:53:53,964
Then not jihadists.
They haven't gone out and slaughtered 

1019
00:53:56,071 --> 00:53:56,904
anybody,
but they were protecting a jihadist 

1020
00:53:59,430 --> 00:54:00,263
because there is limits and this is,
this is the problem when we get huge 

1021
00:54:04,201 --> 00:54:07,230
numbers of people moving into Western 
societies,

1022
00:54:07,440 --> 00:54:08,273
they create these ghettos,
they create centers of power and then 

1023
00:54:12,241 --> 00:54:14,610
isis comes out and its manifesto and 
says,

1024
00:54:15,060 --> 00:54:15,893
we're going to encourage the creation of
these ghettos in the west to radicalize 

1025
00:54:19,121 --> 00:54:23,370
these populations to support our cause.
Then that's a problem.

1026
00:54:23,610 --> 00:54:24,443
I mean,
you can get an AK 47 on the streets and 

1027
00:54:26,370 --> 00:54:29,640
Malombe within a few hours for 400 
euros.

1028
00:54:29,970 --> 00:54:30,803
That's doesn't just arise out jihadists.
That's this whole is support network 

1029
00:54:35,880 --> 00:54:36,713
that protects Solo Abdeslam for example.
So that's the distinction we need to 

1030
00:54:41,101 --> 00:54:44,820
emphasize to leftists and regressives.
Again,

1031
00:54:44,821 --> 00:54:45,654
it's not a tiny minority.
We have to include Islamis as part of 

1032
00:54:48,721 --> 00:54:51,780
the problem and if you include them as 
part of the problem,

1033
00:54:51,960 --> 00:54:56,960
the figures show that it's a distressing
proportion of people who support,

1034
00:54:57,301 --> 00:54:59,960
advocate and promote these intolerant 
believers.

1035
00:55:00,060 --> 00:55:00,893
Yeah,
and I know no matter how many times we 

1036
00:55:02,231 --> 00:55:03,064
repeat the difference between jihadists 
and Islamists and the average nominal 

1037
00:55:06,461 --> 00:55:09,850
Muslim somehow that just can't get 
through to a certain amount of people.

1038
00:55:09,851 --> 00:55:10,684
But before I let you go,
I want to dive into the immigration 

1039
00:55:12,401 --> 00:55:13,234
thing a little deeper because you've 
done a lot on it and when I've watched 

1040
00:55:15,731 --> 00:55:16,950
some of your videos,
you know,

1041
00:55:16,990 --> 00:55:17,823
we really,
in the mainstream media in the United 

1042
00:55:19,300 --> 00:55:21,040
States,
we barely talk about it.

1043
00:55:21,250 --> 00:55:24,580
I would guess that if you watch CNN 24 
hours today,

1044
00:55:24,850 --> 00:55:27,280
um,
that you wouldn't see one story on it,

1045
00:55:27,281 --> 00:55:29,390
literally not one minute on it.
Um,

1046
00:55:29,430 --> 00:55:33,160
and then I watch your videos and some 
other people and I will watch some stuff

1047
00:55:33,161 --> 00:55:33,994
on the BBC or something like that and I 
get a sense that it's a big problem and 

1048
00:55:36,281 --> 00:55:37,114
I get tons of messages.
Mainly I'm getting a ton of stuff from 

1049
00:55:39,041 --> 00:55:44,041
Sweden especially talking about this.
Would you say out of a 10 where,

1050
00:55:44,231 --> 00:55:45,880
where is this thing hat right now?
I mean,

1051
00:55:45,881 --> 00:55:49,240
is this really as bad as the videos that
you put out?

1052
00:55:49,241 --> 00:55:51,850
It makes it sound like there's a massive
crisis right now,

1053
00:55:52,060 --> 00:55:55,690
or is some of it overblown?
Is it different for every country?

1054
00:55:55,710 --> 00:55:57,550
I'm still struggling to get a hold on 
it.

1055
00:55:58,750 --> 00:56:00,910
Well,
it's different for every country.

1056
00:56:00,911 --> 00:56:04,690
That tends to be a tipping point.
When a country goes above,

1057
00:56:04,691 --> 00:56:08,080
for example,
six to seven percent Muslim population,

1058
00:56:08,500 --> 00:56:09,333
that's when you get the no go areas,
which the media still claims is a 

1059
00:56:13,121 --> 00:56:16,320
conspiracy theory.
I got chased out of one in molenbeek.

1060
00:56:16,330 --> 00:56:19,960
I can attest to the fact that it's not.
So that's the kind of tipping point.

1061
00:56:20,250 --> 00:56:21,083
I mean to illustrate this,
you can look at the prison in these 

1062
00:56:24,251 --> 00:56:26,860
different European countries.
So for example,

1063
00:56:26,861 --> 00:56:27,694
Belgium,
which of course just stuff that the 

1064
00:56:28,481 --> 00:56:29,314
Brussels attack,
the Muslim population is around six 

1065
00:56:31,841 --> 00:56:32,674
percent,
but the prison population of Belgium 

1066
00:56:35,140 --> 00:56:35,973
comprises 45 percent Muslims.
The 45 percent of the prisoners in 

1067
00:56:40,991 --> 00:56:42,610
Belgium.
A Muslims,

1068
00:56:42,611 --> 00:56:45,310
despite the fact they only make up six 
percent of the population.

1069
00:56:45,610 --> 00:56:49,540
You look at friends,
six to 10 percent Muslim population,

1070
00:56:49,840 --> 00:56:53,800
but the prison population is 70 percent 
Muslims.

1071
00:56:54,070 --> 00:56:56,530
Same in Spain.
Muslim population,

1072
00:56:56,531 --> 00:57:01,060
three point seven percent.
Prison population is 70 percent Muslim,

1073
00:57:01,480 --> 00:57:06,480
so obviously something is broken here 
and we were getting the correct word,

1074
00:57:06,831 --> 00:57:09,100
seeing the creation of more of these 
ghettos,

1075
00:57:09,490 --> 00:57:10,323
they don't assimilate for our political 
leaders want to bring them in for their 

1076
00:57:14,141 --> 00:57:14,974
own agenda,
which is the goal of imposing huge 

1077
00:57:18,671 --> 00:57:22,690
numbers of people from the third world 
to vote for bigger government.

1078
00:57:22,990 --> 00:57:25,420
If you look at polls conducted amongst 
Muslims,

1079
00:57:25,810 --> 00:57:26,643
they typically support expanded welfare 
state and they vote once they become 

1080
00:57:30,670 --> 00:57:35,380
citizens for bigger government,
so they've placed Europe security.

1081
00:57:35,620 --> 00:57:40,620
They placed our entire social cohesion 
under grave danger in favor of.

1082
00:57:41,230 --> 00:57:43,510
Of advancing this political agenda.
Yeah.

1083
00:57:43,620 --> 00:57:46,160
Do you think it was that in the case of 
like Angola Merkel,

1084
00:57:46,200 --> 00:57:48,080
do you think it was that calculated like
I.

1085
00:57:48,090 --> 00:57:48,923
my sense is that there was some level of
guilt because of the Holocaust and 

1086
00:57:52,081 --> 00:57:53,790
Germany's stills trying to deal with 
that,

1087
00:57:53,791 --> 00:57:56,850
that they partly we're trying to do 
something good here.

1088
00:57:56,851 --> 00:57:57,684
They brought this.
I think it's one point two or one point 

1089
00:57:59,011 --> 00:57:59,844
3 million people in and that it is just 
crushing the system and creating all 

1090
00:58:04,111 --> 00:58:08,880
this resentment and a country that has,
has a tough history with xenophobia.

1091
00:58:09,090 --> 00:58:12,030
It's only gonna get worse and it's hard 
to believe,

1092
00:58:12,360 --> 00:58:13,193
uh,
that she knowingly did this even if it 

1093
00:58:15,811 --> 00:58:19,140
was just to get votes,
which it's not working right,

1094
00:58:19,141 --> 00:58:19,974
because it didn't,
some of the right parties just win 

1095
00:58:21,830 --> 00:58:22,663
elections.

1096
00:58:23,530 --> 00:58:24,290
No,
not.

1097
00:58:24,290 --> 00:58:25,760
It was a reaction to that.
I mean,

1098
00:58:25,761 --> 00:58:26,594
for the past couple of years you've had 
a basically a conservative backlash 

1099
00:58:29,301 --> 00:58:30,240
sweeping Europe,
the,

1100
00:58:30,620 --> 00:58:35,620
your elections in 2014 proof of that.
So it was a backlash to that.

1101
00:58:36,110 --> 00:58:39,170
Now of course,
500,000

1102
00:58:39,171 --> 00:58:43,790
migrants who have come into Germany 
haven't registered with all authorities,

1103
00:58:43,970 --> 00:58:45,890
so that's going to become a massive 
problem.

1104
00:58:46,220 --> 00:58:47,053
But yeah,
a lot of it was virtue signaling on 

1105
00:58:48,621 --> 00:58:49,431
steroids.
Right.

1106
00:58:49,431 --> 00:58:50,470
So you had,
you know,

1107
00:58:50,510 --> 00:58:52,940
the German Green Party politician,
Stephanie,

1108
00:58:52,941 --> 00:58:53,774
Yvonne Berg,
she got up in front of the German 

1109
00:58:55,701 --> 00:58:57,600
parliament and said,
Whoa,

1110
00:58:57,990 --> 00:59:01,130
ass city will change radically.
I hold it in 20,

1111
00:59:01,131 --> 00:59:04,070
30 years.
They will no longer be a German majority

1112
00:59:04,280 --> 00:59:05,113
in our city and that's a good thing.
So she said that simply as a way of 

1113
00:59:11,030 --> 00:59:11,863
pissing off the right wing in Germany,
they would bring in these migrants to 

1114
00:59:15,711 --> 00:59:19,720
displace the German population.
So it,

1115
00:59:19,770 --> 00:59:22,310
part of it is virtue on steroids.

1116
00:59:22,520 --> 00:59:25,340
Part of it is that guilt about the 
Nazis,

1117
00:59:25,341 --> 00:59:26,174
which of course we have to remember only
a minority of the German population 

1118
00:59:29,720 --> 00:59:33,290
actually supported the Nazi party in the
19 thirties.

1119
00:59:33,530 --> 00:59:35,960
So I would argue that,
why would you punish,

1120
00:59:35,990 --> 00:59:37,160
you know,
German citizens,

1121
00:59:37,161 --> 00:59:37,994
taxpayers now we've got Germans being 
kicked out of social housing to be 

1122
00:59:41,841 --> 00:59:42,674
replaced by migrants over one point,
2 million migrants brought in already 

1123
00:59:46,791 --> 00:59:48,590
over the past year.
And again,

1124
00:59:48,591 --> 00:59:51,540
politicians celebrating the 
demographics,

1125
00:59:51,541 --> 00:59:52,374
suicide of their country and it clearly 
isn't working because every single day 

1126
00:59:57,170 --> 01:00:00,140
we have these cases of people being 
raped now,

1127
01:00:00,141 --> 01:00:04,690
the primary victims of rape of Muslim 
women and girls in these moment,

1128
01:00:04,820 --> 01:00:07,790
migrant camps.
But now you see these reports of,

1129
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:11,000
you know,
African migrants raping boys in swimming

1130
01:00:11,001 --> 01:00:12,500
pools.
And quite frankly,

1131
01:00:12,501 --> 01:00:17,360
I'm sick of seeing it every single day.
This is a bad culture.

1132
01:00:17,570 --> 01:00:18,403
These people aren't being assimilated.
If you import huge numbers of people at 

1133
01:00:22,761 --> 01:00:26,570
break neck speed with no clear plan on 
how to assimilate them,

1134
01:00:26,840 --> 01:00:30,560
there's going to be bedlam,
there's going to be chaos and that's now

1135
01:00:30,570 --> 01:00:31,403
why top military chiefs in Sweden and 
Switzerland in Norway or warning that 

1136
01:00:36,501 --> 01:00:39,590
this could lead to civil unrest,
an outright war.

1137
01:00:39,591 --> 01:00:41,750
Basically if it.
If it continues this way.

1138
01:00:41,900 --> 01:00:42,733
Yeah man,
I wanted to end with you on a positive 

1139
01:00:44,361 --> 01:00:46,520
note.
Can we figure out how to do that?

1140
01:00:46,521 --> 01:00:48,260
Whereas Europe going to be in 10 years,
any hope?

1141
01:00:50,400 --> 01:00:51,151
Well,
as I said,

1142
01:00:51,151 --> 01:00:51,984
I mean a lot of these parties are being 
voted out of power and that's been 

1143
01:00:55,531 --> 01:00:56,364
happening for the past couple of years.
So there is a kind of backlash against 

1144
01:00:59,821 --> 01:01:00,720
it.
You know,

1145
01:01:00,780 --> 01:01:01,613
I'm all for limited skilled immigration.
I don't think that's healthy for a 

1146
01:01:05,551 --> 01:01:07,740
society,
but the way it's going,

1147
01:01:07,950 --> 01:01:09,960
you know,
300,000

1148
01:01:10,170 --> 01:01:13,020
immigrants every year coming into the 
United Kingdom.

1149
01:01:13,290 --> 01:01:16,710
We've only got a population of $60 
million and that's after the.

1150
01:01:16,760 --> 01:01:18,990
That's the number after the other ones 
have left.

1151
01:01:19,320 --> 01:01:22,860
So it's going to become overwhelming,
it's going to cause more problems,

1152
01:01:22,861 --> 01:01:25,950
more riots,
but from a positive perspective,

1153
01:01:26,300 --> 01:01:27,133
you know my videos,
your videos about this or reaching a 

1154
01:01:29,731 --> 01:01:33,810
huge audience because the media 
continually lies about it.

1155
01:01:34,050 --> 01:01:37,920
They don't point out that 72 percent of 
the people coming in and man,

1156
01:01:38,100 --> 01:01:42,930
these are generally not families.
Four fifths of them at one point weren't

1157
01:01:42,931 --> 01:01:46,260
even Syrians,
but the fact that I can do a video about

1158
01:01:46,261 --> 01:01:47,094
this and it gets over a million views,
proves that people are thirsty for the 

1159
01:01:50,671 --> 01:01:51,504
truth and we are shaping the narrative 
and eventually the hope is that that 

1160
01:01:56,131 --> 01:01:59,940
will change government policy by sheer 
force of pressure.

1161
01:02:00,440 --> 01:02:01,310
All right,
well listen,

1162
01:02:01,311 --> 01:02:05,540
that's exactly why I try to have these 
conversations and that's why I liked the

1163
01:02:05,541 --> 01:02:06,374
work you do and you know what?
Here's what we'll do for anyone that's 

1164
01:02:08,601 --> 01:02:09,434
watching this that thinks that anything 
that Paul said was conspiratorial or 

1165
01:02:13,401 --> 01:02:14,234
unfactual,
tag me on twitter with them and we'll 

1166
01:02:16,071 --> 01:02:18,380
talk some of this stuff out.
Will you make that commitment?

1167
01:02:18,470 --> 01:02:20,550
We'll talk some this stuff out with a 
couple of the people.

1168
