1
00:00:05,090 --> 00:00:05,923
One of the things I'm most amazed by at 
the moment is how the ideas and issues 

2
00:00:08,091 --> 00:00:10,910
that we're talking about every week here
on the Rubin report are relevant,

3
00:00:10,911 --> 00:00:13,520
not just in America,
but all over the world.

4
00:00:13,550 --> 00:00:15,950
The amount of email I'm getting from you
guys across the globe,

5
00:00:15,951 --> 00:00:17,270
whether it's Sweden,
Australia,

6
00:00:17,271 --> 00:00:18,190
Brazil,
hungrier.

7
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:19,033
Japan is actually staggering.
It really seems to me that there has 

8
00:00:22,251 --> 00:00:26,510
been a real awakening as to what being a
free human being is all about.

9
00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:31,220
You are in charge of your own life and 
if you start with this simple premise,

10
00:00:31,460 --> 00:00:32,293
you can accomplish anything.
While the discourse on social media may 

11
00:00:34,791 --> 00:00:35,624
seem more toxic than ever,
I see a growing dynamic group of people 

12
00:00:38,361 --> 00:00:39,194
coming together through ideas and 
conversation regardless of where they 

13
00:00:42,081 --> 00:00:46,320
were born or the color of their skin.
We're partnering with learn liberty this

14
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:48,620
week and our guest is Rajshree Agarwal.

15
00:00:48,770 --> 00:00:49,603
She was born in India to a traditional 
family only move to America where she 

16
00:00:52,971 --> 00:00:53,804
now teaches about capitalism at the 
University of Maryland where she is the 

17
00:00:57,441 --> 00:00:58,274
chair and professor of entrepreneurship.
She believes that capitalism provides 

18
00:01:02,001 --> 00:01:06,140
maximum freedom and happiness to all 
people regardless of race,

19
00:01:06,141 --> 00:01:07,580
religion,
or anything else,

20
00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:08,713
the ideas of freedom that one sparked in
her as a young child or the same ideas 

21
00:01:12,651 --> 00:01:17,000
that she's now helping further by 
teaching minds of young people today.

22
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:18,073
That is what freedom is all about.
If you want to join me in spreading 

23
00:01:20,541 --> 00:01:23,270
these ideas of freedom and individuality
in person,

24
00:01:23,271 --> 00:01:27,500
I will be joining Jordan Peterson on his
12 rules for life tour for as many dates

25
00:01:27,501 --> 00:01:30,380
as I can possibly fit in.
We kicked off the tour a couple of weeks

26
00:01:30,380 --> 00:01:31,213
ago at the beacon in New York City where
the energy in the room was absolutely 

27
00:01:33,861 --> 00:01:34,694
bananas.
I'll be traveling with Jordan to the UK 

28
00:01:36,441 --> 00:01:40,370
to speak in London at the Apollo 
Hammersmith Theater on May 13th,

29
00:01:40,371 --> 00:01:41,204
and then on May 14th,
I have the incredible honor of speaking 

30
00:01:43,731 --> 00:01:44,870
at the Oxford Union.

31
00:01:45,020 --> 00:01:45,853
Hopefully I'll get to meet as many you 
guys as possible and I also promised to 

32
00:01:49,100 --> 00:01:49,933
down as many points as possible.
I'm also working on an Australian tour 

33
00:01:52,641 --> 00:01:55,490
and hope to have some more info on that 
for you guys soon.

34
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:56,753
You know,
I've mentioned on the show lately that 

35
00:01:57,921 --> 00:02:01,610
the endless hysteria of the left and the
politically correct craziness that we're

36
00:02:01,611 --> 00:02:02,444
caught up and was eventually going to 
drag me back into standup comedy and 

37
00:02:05,601 --> 00:02:09,260
this finally came to fruition this past 
Sunday at the Irvine Improv.

38
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:10,393
The show is billed as an evening of 
stand up and sit down as I did about an 

39
00:02:13,610 --> 00:02:14,443
hour of standup and then Bob Saget 
joined me on stage for about 45 minutes 

40
00:02:17,821 --> 00:02:19,430
of a sit down.
It was awesome.

41
00:02:19,431 --> 00:02:22,580
Meeting so many you guys out there in 
the show was a huge success.

42
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:26,510
The manager of the Improv even told me 
that it was the first sold out,

43
00:02:26,511 --> 00:02:27,470
standing ovation.

44
00:02:27,470 --> 00:02:32,120
She seen at the club in her 18 years.
We're going to announce travel dates for

45
00:02:32,121 --> 00:02:32,954
upcoming standup gigs pretty soon and I 
hope that you guys will join me for at 

46
00:02:36,590 --> 00:02:38,750
least a two drink minimum and plenty of 
laughs.

47
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:40,400
And finally,
after years in the making,

48
00:02:40,401 --> 00:02:41,234
we taped our interview with Dr Thomas 
Soul yesterday on location at Stanford 

49
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:46,033
University in San Francisco.
We flew our whole team up there and 

50
00:02:47,991 --> 00:02:48,824
rented a studio to make it happen.
It was truly a personal and career 

51
00:02:51,651 --> 00:02:55,400
highlight for me and I can't wait to 
share our sit down with you next week.

52
00:02:55,550 --> 00:02:58,940
Big thanks to our supporters on Patrion 
who make interviews like this,

53
00:02:59,710 --> 00:03:02,970
so all these announcements aside,
whether a year in the US,

54
00:03:02,980 --> 00:03:04,000
India,
Oxford,

55
00:03:04,001 --> 00:03:05,980
San Francisco,
or anywhere else,

56
00:03:06,130 --> 00:03:06,963
we're all in this fight together.
Keep fighting for what you believe in 

57
00:03:09,910 --> 00:03:10,743
and I'll do the same.
We're continuing our partnership with 

58
00:03:17,311 --> 00:03:21,720
learn liberty today and joining me is 
the root of p lamone chair and professor

59
00:03:21,721 --> 00:03:26,721
of entrepreneurship at the University of
Maryland as well as the director for the

60
00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:29,370
Ed Snider Center for Enterprise and 
Economics.

61
00:03:29,370 --> 00:03:31,950
Rajshree Agarwal.
Welcome to the Rubin report.

62
00:03:32,470 --> 00:03:34,090
Thank you for having me.
Dave.

63
00:03:34,190 --> 00:03:35,023
I feel we're going to have a very good 
talk because we've already sort of had 

64
00:03:37,461 --> 00:03:40,820
the interview before we started.
We've been doing it already.

65
00:03:42,350 --> 00:03:43,183
I'm looking forward to this because we 
did meet once before we were at a 

66
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:51,160
conference in DC that was sort of 
focusing on academia and free speech and

67
00:03:51,171 --> 00:03:54,740
we spent a couple of minutes talking and
what I thought was interesting.

68
00:03:54,741 --> 00:03:55,574
Yeah,
I don't think you knew who I was 

69
00:03:56,241 --> 00:03:57,074
beforehand and that I didn't know who 
you were before hand and they sort of 

70
00:03:59,481 --> 00:04:00,314
brought me there to talk a little bit 
about how youtube plays a part in 

71
00:04:02,631 --> 00:04:07,100
reaching young people and technology and
all that and you were very interested in

72
00:04:07,101 --> 00:04:09,650
that.
So we didn't really focus on free speech

73
00:04:09,651 --> 00:04:10,484
together,
but we focused on how technology is 

74
00:04:12,501 --> 00:04:16,520
shifting the conversation a so just very
quickly to start,

75
00:04:17,780 --> 00:04:22,760
why are you interested in how technology
is affecting the conversation related to

76
00:04:22,761 --> 00:04:25,460
free speech capitalism?
The whole thing.

77
00:04:25,940 --> 00:04:30,140
So I'm not interested in technology per 
se,

78
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:31,753
but I'm interested in technology because
it represents the manifestation of the 

79
00:04:36,411 --> 00:04:39,380
human mind at work.
Ultimately,

80
00:04:39,381 --> 00:04:43,130
what is technology?
Technology is better machines,

81
00:04:43,250 --> 00:04:44,083
but what our machines ultimately,
whether they are fast computers or 

82
00:04:47,601 --> 00:04:52,601
whether they're the industrialized age 
engines or whatever you call it,

83
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:53,953
right?
They are ways for us humans to make our 

84
00:04:57,291 --> 00:04:58,124
lives easier by using machines.
So technology ultimately is a way for 

85
00:05:03,711 --> 00:05:04,544
humans to communicate better,
to live better lives and to use their 

86
00:05:08,091 --> 00:05:11,780
mind in doing so.
So I study innovation.

87
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:12,673
I study technology because it enables us
to be the best we can be by using our 

88
00:05:17,691 --> 00:05:18,100
mind.

89
00:05:18,100 --> 00:05:18,933
I was very proud when you walked in here
because you study innovation and 

90
00:05:21,221 --> 00:05:24,850
entrepreneurship and this is my garage 
that we turned into a studio.

91
00:05:24,851 --> 00:05:25,684
So I thought

92
00:05:26,140 --> 00:05:26,973
yes,
and think about all of the creativity 

93
00:05:29,721 --> 00:05:31,230
that went into it,
right?

94
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:33,570
Not just by you,
but all of the thing,

95
00:05:33,830 --> 00:05:36,760
all of the,
the techniques the machines had,

96
00:05:36,761 --> 00:05:37,594
we're looking around.
It was someone's mind that had to come 

97
00:05:40,701 --> 00:05:43,550
up with it first.
So creativity,

98
00:05:43,580 --> 00:05:47,660
which is at the heart of individual 
enterprise is what I love.

99
00:05:47,750 --> 00:05:48,830
And that's what I study.

100
00:05:48,910 --> 00:05:50,350
All right?
So that's what we're going to spend most

101
00:05:50,351 --> 00:05:52,270
of this hour talking about that.
Uh,

102
00:05:52,271 --> 00:05:53,104
and you know,
when we do these shows with learn 

103
00:05:53,891 --> 00:05:54,724
liberty,
they always send me just a quick one 

104
00:05:55,631 --> 00:05:58,370
page bio and everybody and I really 
loved years.

105
00:05:58,371 --> 00:05:59,640
There was a bunch of quotes in there 
that I,

106
00:05:59,641 --> 00:06:02,470
that I want to quote directly to you,
um,

107
00:06:02,700 --> 00:06:03,390
but

108
00:06:03,390 --> 00:06:04,223
no,
that when they asked me to write that 

109
00:06:05,251 --> 00:06:06,084
bio,
I dish that out in about 15 minutes at 

110
00:06:10,201 --> 00:06:11,490
4:30
in the morning.

111
00:06:11,570 --> 00:06:13,790
Oh,
look at you patting yourself on the back

112
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:16,900
saying,
well,

113
00:06:17,090 --> 00:06:17,923
this was really good when you got here.
But first let's talk a little bit about 

114
00:06:20,691 --> 00:06:22,700
your history because you have an 
interesting history.

115
00:06:23,030 --> 00:06:25,370
You were born in India and you lived 
there for that,

116
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:27,800
for your first 21 years.
Tell me a little bit about that.

117
00:06:28,450 --> 00:06:29,650
Well,
um,

118
00:06:29,740 --> 00:06:32,530
I was born to a very,
very traditional family,

119
00:06:32,740 --> 00:06:33,573
Hindu family.
My father was your typical rags to 

120
00:06:37,541 --> 00:06:42,340
riches entrepreneur.
He embodied enterprise and he,

121
00:06:42,341 --> 00:06:44,950
in fact,
I'll tell you about this one story.

122
00:06:45,570 --> 00:06:46,403
I was in fifth grade and I came home so 
upset because the history lesson that I 

123
00:06:51,701 --> 00:06:56,290
had just heard was all about how the 
United Kingdom,

124
00:06:56,291 --> 00:07:00,340
Britain came in and just plundered his 
Golden Pico.

125
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:01,233
That was Indian.
Look at all the nasty things that they 

126
00:07:03,041 --> 00:07:06,130
did to us and how oppressed and 
victimized we were.

127
00:07:06,340 --> 00:07:07,173
And my father,
who was a very much a traditional 

128
00:07:09,100 --> 00:07:12,220
Orthodox Hindu at that time said,
no,

129
00:07:12,970 --> 00:07:17,440
actually Britain did more good for India
than they did bad.

130
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:19,210
And it's like,
Huh,

131
00:07:19,750 --> 00:07:20,583
what do you mean by that?
And he went on to talk about why before 

132
00:07:23,921 --> 00:07:27,910
that it's true that India was rich,
but what does rich mean?

133
00:07:28,180 --> 00:07:31,690
It meant that the kings and the traders 
were rich,

134
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:35,080
but then also very feudalist economy at 
that time.

135
00:07:35,230 --> 00:07:38,530
And of course they were also very 
balconies because each of these kingdoms

136
00:07:38,531 --> 00:07:39,364
were fighting with each other.
So one of the things that he talked 

137
00:07:41,411 --> 00:07:45,100
about is how the advent of the British,
you know,

138
00:07:45,101 --> 00:07:47,380
they bought the rule of law,
they bought infrastructure,

139
00:07:47,381 --> 00:07:49,570
they gave us English as a language.
You know,

140
00:07:49,571 --> 00:07:50,950
often people,
my husband says,

141
00:07:50,980 --> 00:07:52,840
Oh wow,
you talk better English than I do.

142
00:07:53,260 --> 00:07:54,640
And it's like,
yes,

143
00:07:54,970 --> 00:07:57,730
that's because I was educated in English
as well.

144
00:07:58,570 --> 00:08:03,570
But at the same time that he was such a 
entrepreneur in his mindset,

145
00:08:04,090 --> 00:08:08,170
he was very traditionalist in his views 
of how a woman should be.

146
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:11,620
And so when I was 12 years old,
he said to me,

147
00:08:12,010 --> 00:08:16,660
the right and the responsibility of 
finding a husband for you is mine,

148
00:08:17,290 --> 00:08:18,123
don't you forget that.
And of course any woman in his family 

149
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:22,953
couldn't work because that was a slap on
his face in his ability to provide for 

150
00:08:26,531 --> 00:08:27,010
us.

151
00:08:27,010 --> 00:08:27,843
But if you think about it at 12 years 
old and being told that the two biggest 

152
00:08:32,381 --> 00:08:33,214
decisions any individual can make for 
themselves who you marry and what you 

153
00:08:38,591 --> 00:08:40,240
choose to work in.
And I,

154
00:08:40,241 --> 00:08:41,900
and I,
and I tell you know,

155
00:08:42,700 --> 00:08:45,580
I'd like to think that those two 
decisions under grid,

156
00:08:45,670 --> 00:08:50,560
everything that we do both at work and 
they're not work life that we live.

157
00:08:51,220 --> 00:08:52,053
If those are taken away from you,
what does that mean about you as an 

158
00:08:56,041 --> 00:08:58,050
individual?
You as a person.

159
00:08:58,350 --> 00:08:59,183
So between 12 and 18,
I had to navigate that distance because 

160
00:09:02,701 --> 00:09:05,040
at 12 years old I was a daddy's girl.
Instead,

161
00:09:05,041 --> 00:09:05,910
of course,
dad,

162
00:09:05,911 --> 00:09:06,744
just please do me a favor.
Find me a husband who lives in Bombay 

163
00:09:10,710 --> 00:09:11,543
because I can't even bear the thought of
being in a city that's different from 

164
00:09:14,281 --> 00:09:18,390
you.
And at 18 I had to see for myself that I

165
00:09:18,391 --> 00:09:19,224
couldn't renege on that decision,
so between 18 and 21 was really my 

166
00:09:24,301 --> 00:09:29,040
discovery of who I wanted to be.
And at 21 I left India,

167
00:09:29,041 --> 00:09:32,520
two suitcases in my hand left everybody 
that I loved,

168
00:09:32,550 --> 00:09:33,383
a very generous inheritance and my 
father did not speak to me for seven 

169
00:09:36,541 --> 00:09:37,374
years.

170
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:38,580
Wow.
I mean there's,

171
00:09:38,610 --> 00:09:42,480
there's so much there of your formative 
stuff that,

172
00:09:42,481 --> 00:09:44,490
that leads you to where you're at right 
now.

173
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:47,220
When you came home that day in fifth 
grade,

174
00:09:47,310 --> 00:09:48,143
you learned something in school and then
you hear something different from your 

175
00:09:51,601 --> 00:09:54,570
father who you obviously respected and 
admired and had,

176
00:09:54,750 --> 00:09:55,583
as you said,
rags to riches had provided a good life 

177
00:09:57,031 --> 00:09:57,864
for you guys.
How did you go back to school after 

178
00:10:00,001 --> 00:10:00,391
that?
I mean,

179
00:10:00,391 --> 00:10:02,850
did you go back and start arguing with 
teachers?

180
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:04,730
Oh,
I was always arguing with.

181
00:10:05,150 --> 00:10:06,030
I was.
In fact,

182
00:10:06,031 --> 00:10:09,150
I remember my science teacher saying 
Rajshree,

183
00:10:09,330 --> 00:10:11,370
why do you ask so many wise?

184
00:10:14,140 --> 00:10:15,440
Pretty sure that's not what a science 
teacher.

185
00:10:15,441 --> 00:10:19,520
You're supposed to say that.
That's really fascinating.

186
00:10:19,521 --> 00:10:23,810
So you picked up and left and left an 
inheritance.

187
00:10:23,811 --> 00:10:26,000
All of this,
you get to America.

188
00:10:26,270 --> 00:10:28,760
Just tell me a little bit about that 
initial experience.

189
00:10:28,890 --> 00:10:29,800
So,
uh,

190
00:10:29,940 --> 00:10:31,590
for me,
uh,

191
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:33,690
this was,
um,

192
00:10:34,140 --> 00:10:36,820
freedom.
Uh,

193
00:10:36,870 --> 00:10:38,790
it was,
you know,

194
00:10:38,791 --> 00:10:39,624
I had lived in India,
especially in the generation that I was 

195
00:10:42,781 --> 00:10:43,614
in.
A woman didn't go or a woman did not 

196
00:10:45,841 --> 00:10:47,300
live by themselves,
right?

197
00:10:47,340 --> 00:10:49,680
The God,
they stayed with their parents still.

198
00:10:49,681 --> 00:10:52,950
They were married and then they went to 
their husband's house.

199
00:10:53,250 --> 00:10:54,083
So the concept of really being yourself 
and having the responsibility to make 

200
00:11:00,781 --> 00:11:01,614
your own choices is both liberating.
But then I also realized I can't blame 

201
00:11:06,031 --> 00:11:09,230
my parents were my mistakes anymore.
Indeed.

202
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:11,610
Oh,
five years later I've been my mom,

203
00:11:11,611 --> 00:11:14,820
or six years later when my mom came to 
visit with us,

204
00:11:14,821 --> 00:11:16,920
my husband said,
you know,

205
00:11:17,130 --> 00:11:19,950
what is the one biggest difference that 
you've seen your daughter?

206
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:22,830
And this will tell you a little bit 
about my personality there too.

207
00:11:23,190 --> 00:11:27,240
She says to him,
she's become very responsible.

208
00:11:28,470 --> 00:11:30,220
Wow,
that's fascinating guy.

209
00:11:30,490 --> 00:11:32,700
And she's uses this as evidence.
She says,

210
00:11:32,701 --> 00:11:33,534
you know,
are her father used to give her a very 

211
00:11:37,201 --> 00:11:40,620
generous allowance,
but we were,

212
00:11:40,860 --> 00:11:41,693
we would marvel at the fact that this 
kid would go through this allowance 

213
00:11:45,361 --> 00:11:46,194
within 10 or 12 days and then she'd say,
I'd like more and then her father would 

214
00:11:49,651 --> 00:11:51,270
sometimes give it and sometimes there's 
no,

215
00:11:51,510 --> 00:11:52,343
that's all you're going to get.
So then come to me or she'd come to her 

216
00:11:54,791 --> 00:11:55,624
brother or I started to Taylor because I
often said I owned my own bread and 

217
00:11:59,291 --> 00:12:00,124
butter,
but my father provided we met with the 

218
00:12:02,081 --> 00:12:03,350
jam.
Right.

219
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:04,210
But,
uh,

220
00:12:04,210 --> 00:12:05,043
one of the things that she said was,
now she looks at me and she's realized 

221
00:12:08,811 --> 00:12:09,644
is just how responsible that become.
That where before money would just flow 

222
00:12:13,781 --> 00:12:16,540
off of my fingers and I wouldn't give it
a second thought.

223
00:12:16,810 --> 00:12:17,643
I had become so much more responsible in
my thinking and I think she was talking 

224
00:12:20,801 --> 00:12:24,100
a lot more about than just money in 
India.

225
00:12:24,100 --> 00:12:28,480
I was rebelling because I was fighting 
against something.

226
00:12:29,050 --> 00:12:32,650
I came to the United States.
I didn't have to fight against anything.

227
00:12:32,860 --> 00:12:33,693
So I had to figure out who I was.
And what I really wanted to be and it 

228
00:12:36,841 --> 00:12:39,760
allowed me to thrive.
So you mentioned you didn't talk to your

229
00:12:39,761 --> 00:12:43,810
father for seven years after that.
It had the reconciliation it or was it a

230
00:12:43,930 --> 00:12:45,820
reconciliation?
Reconciliation?

231
00:12:45,821 --> 00:12:47,770
In fact,
one of the things that I really,

232
00:12:47,771 --> 00:12:50,330
really treasure is,
um,

233
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:51,340
you know,
for the,

234
00:12:52,060 --> 00:12:57,060
I was a daddy's girl and I did want his 
approval and after I got my phd,

235
00:12:58,541 --> 00:12:59,374
I remember this one conversation that I 
had with him where I was the prodigal 

236
00:13:03,041 --> 00:13:05,320
daughter.
He was just finally talking to me again.

237
00:13:05,321 --> 00:13:06,154
I think he'd given up on the fact that I
would be this person that would 

238
00:13:09,041 --> 00:13:11,740
ultimately come home with my tail 
between my legs and say,

239
00:13:11,741 --> 00:13:13,120
you know,
you were right.

240
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:15,050
I was wrong.
He just completely given up on that.

241
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:20,640
And so he was listening to me and of 
course I was trying to impress him.

242
00:13:21,220 --> 00:13:22,053
So I was talking to him about all of 
these achievements as a young assistant 

243
00:13:24,881 --> 00:13:26,890
professor.
I had received a couple of awards.

244
00:13:27,130 --> 00:13:31,300
I was getting to go to these prestigious
conferences and he's listening,

245
00:13:31,450 --> 00:13:35,110
but there's silence on his side.
And the more I'm talking,

246
00:13:35,111 --> 00:13:38,400
the more he silent and then finally I 
just gave up.

247
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:42,880
I had nothing more to brag about or talk
about and I wasn't getting the.

248
00:13:43,060 --> 00:13:43,893
I'm so proud of you from him.
And so there was this uncomfortable 

249
00:13:46,811 --> 00:13:51,811
silence after which he says it's a 
phrase in Hindi which roughly translated

250
00:13:53,201 --> 00:13:58,201
says if a peacock dances in a forest who
sees.

251
00:13:58,900 --> 00:14:02,050
So who cares?
And his point to me was,

252
00:14:02,051 --> 00:14:05,830
you can be all of the peacock,
you are,

253
00:14:05,831 --> 00:14:10,210
but if you're not next to me,
it doesn't mean anything.

254
00:14:10,270 --> 00:14:13,120
So that was the harshness that we 
started off with,

255
00:14:13,450 --> 00:14:18,450
even in the reconciliation.
But my last visit with him paradoxically

256
00:14:18,581 --> 00:14:21,820
was when I was asked to give a keynote 
in India.

257
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,940
This was immediately after India's 
liberalization.

258
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:28,480
It was trying as an economy that we now 
know it to be.

259
00:14:28,780 --> 00:14:29,613
And so I was asked to give a keynote at 
an academic conference on 

260
00:14:32,590 --> 00:14:37,180
entrepreneurship and economic growth.
And so on my way to this conference,

261
00:14:37,181 --> 00:14:41,800
I stopped by and 10 years after I had 
done my phd,

262
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:47,040
I'm finally talking to my father about 
my research and connecting it to his own

263
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:48,153
entrepreneurial spirit and him being a 
serial entrepreneur and I can finally 

264
00:14:52,101 --> 00:14:52,934
see the pride in his eyes.
I got there and then add the keynote at 

265
00:14:57,741 --> 00:14:59,690
the end of this thing.
When you go to India,

266
00:14:59,691 --> 00:15:02,870
you realize that when you give a speech,
they will give you a present.

267
00:15:03,350 --> 00:15:04,183
So in front of about 500 people,
they give me this president that I 

268
00:15:07,700 --> 00:15:09,980
opened and believe it or not,
it's a peacock.

269
00:15:11,590 --> 00:15:12,423
Seems fitting seems there's so much 
there and it's so obvious hearing this 

270
00:15:15,651 --> 00:15:16,484
story,
how it led to all of the things that 

271
00:15:18,001 --> 00:15:18,834
you're teaching about now and care about
the concept between the battle between 

272
00:15:21,931 --> 00:15:22,764
sort of traditionalism and then the 
entrepreneurial spirit is really a 

273
00:15:27,361 --> 00:15:30,420
fascinating one because he obviously had
that.

274
00:15:30,450 --> 00:15:32,670
Yes,
he built something for himself,

275
00:15:32,700 --> 00:15:36,670
built a good life,
and then still wanted that piece of sort

276
00:15:36,671 --> 00:15:39,300
of the old world.
And I think we all kind of struggle with

277
00:15:39,301 --> 00:15:40,134
that in a way.
Maybe that's what the struggle of 

278
00:15:41,461 --> 00:15:43,500
western civilization is and stuff.

279
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:45,313
I actually think that this relates to 
often the need to think and integrate 

280
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:53,673
one psychological growth with one's 
growth in the material and in the 

281
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:01,473
Richard Israel.
So one of the things that I think my 

282
00:16:03,670 --> 00:16:04,503
father was as a paradox unfortunately,
and I think that caused him as well as 

283
00:16:09,700 --> 00:16:13,750
me,
so much of this angsty between us,

284
00:16:14,050 --> 00:16:19,050
is that at the same time that he applied
his intellect into the economic realm,

285
00:16:21,250 --> 00:16:25,180
he psychologically did not necessarily 
realize that,

286
00:16:25,540 --> 00:16:26,373
you know,
part of the reason he was successful is 

287
00:16:28,211 --> 00:16:31,450
because he was able to make his own 
decisions,

288
00:16:31,451 --> 00:16:32,284
which also meant the freedom to make 
your own mistakes and learn from your 

289
00:16:35,711 --> 00:16:36,544
mistakes.
So why he allowed that there as far as 

290
00:16:40,060 --> 00:16:43,210
family was concerned.
There was this very protectionist,

291
00:16:43,450 --> 00:16:44,283
I need to take care of you,
but that I'm realizing this as a parent 

292
00:16:48,161 --> 00:16:48,994
is not very conducive to your children's
growth because what you really need to 

293
00:16:54,221 --> 00:16:55,054
give them are the tools to make their 
own decisions as opposed to telling 

294
00:16:59,261 --> 00:17:00,370
them,
you know,

295
00:17:00,371 --> 00:17:01,710
this is the way you should do it.

296
00:17:01,850 --> 00:17:03,240
Yeah.
And ironically,

297
00:17:03,241 --> 00:17:06,000
had you not broken away and been free,
although,

298
00:17:06,060 --> 00:17:06,893
although he may have been very pleased 
with your life and who knows what your 

299
00:17:08,911 --> 00:17:09,744
life would be and maybe you maybe you 
would be happy in some ways it wouldn't 

300
00:17:12,361 --> 00:17:15,380
have led you to all this,
so you had to directly have to do that.

301
00:17:16,140 --> 00:17:16,973
So.
So one more thing about India before we 

302
00:17:18,091 --> 00:17:20,130
move on to everything else that you're 
doing.

303
00:17:20,300 --> 00:17:23,190
A I told you right before we started 
that I can a ton of fan mail from India.

304
00:17:23,191 --> 00:17:24,024
I think there's some really interesting 
political things happening right there 

305
00:17:26,161 --> 00:17:29,220
that seemed to be driving people to 
watching shows like this.

306
00:17:29,610 --> 00:17:33,600
Just give me one thing that we should 
know about India right now that maybe we

307
00:17:33,601 --> 00:17:34,434
don't know as Americans,
which I think is probably probably 

308
00:17:36,660 --> 00:17:38,750
everything because India never comes up 
in the new Israeli.

309
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:40,073
So.
So I can talk about India right now a 

310
00:17:43,981 --> 00:17:44,814
little less than I can talk about the 
India that I grew up in and why growing 

311
00:17:49,110 --> 00:17:52,590
in India actually fostered my 
entrepreneurial spirit.

312
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:54,450
Okay.
So we can do it a little bit of a little

313
00:17:54,451 --> 00:17:55,290
bit of that.
Right.

314
00:17:55,291 --> 00:17:57,390
And I think that that is one of the 
aspects.

315
00:17:57,391 --> 00:18:02,391
It's definitely selection at play,
but I do think that across every culture

316
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:06,210
people,
individuals are born Tabula Rasa,

317
00:18:06,450 --> 00:18:07,283
some cultures are much more conducive to
having the entrepreneurial spirit bloom 

318
00:18:11,820 --> 00:18:14,730
and as a result you see people go so 
much farther.

319
00:18:15,030 --> 00:18:17,670
But there are other cultures and other 
cultures stifle it.

320
00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:18,533
But as individuals,
I think we all have the same proclivity 

321
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:24,233
to be the persons that we can be.
But one of the things that I always 

322
00:18:27,901 --> 00:18:28,734
credited in my education in India is the
focus on thinking and critical thinking 

323
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:36,870
and intellectual ism.

324
00:18:37,140 --> 00:18:42,140
So the concept of a nerd growing up for 
me was unheard off because the,

325
00:18:43,620 --> 00:18:44,453
the coolest kids were also the ones that
participated in science and elocution 

326
00:18:49,411 --> 00:18:50,550
debates.
You know,

327
00:18:50,551 --> 00:18:51,384
I was always at the forefront.
I wasn't so much of a sportsperson 

328
00:18:53,940 --> 00:18:54,773
right.
But I was very much in debates in 

329
00:18:56,041 --> 00:18:59,190
elocution competitions and science 
competitions and so on.

330
00:18:59,340 --> 00:19:00,173
And that was cool.
That wasn't considered rural United 

331
00:19:02,610 --> 00:19:03,210
States.
Right.

332
00:19:03,210 --> 00:19:07,680
So the concept that there's a node and a
node is socially awkward,

333
00:19:07,900 --> 00:19:10,980
which was unheard of for me.
I'll give you another example.

334
00:19:11,820 --> 00:19:14,760
You know,
my brother was the one that first talked

335
00:19:14,761 --> 00:19:15,594
to me about Iran and of course in that 
journey that I was telling you about 

336
00:19:18,961 --> 00:19:19,794
where I had to find my own identity 
reading atlas shrugged was really the 

337
00:19:23,851 --> 00:19:28,851
pillar of strength and helped me 
identify my own sense of life.

338
00:19:30,060 --> 00:19:30,893
But the way I read atlas shrugged you'd 
find very funny is I'm in colleges in 

339
00:19:35,911 --> 00:19:36,744
India.

340
00:19:36,990 --> 00:19:39,840
If you're a guy and you want to impress 
a chick,

341
00:19:40,890 --> 00:19:43,560
you carry,
at least in my time,

342
00:19:43,830 --> 00:19:44,663
a paperback novel of Atlas shrugged in 
your back pocket because that means if 

343
00:19:48,541 --> 00:19:51,210
you're intellectually you're thinking 
now.

344
00:19:51,211 --> 00:19:54,930
I was also said it was also sad.
That's so fascinating to me.

345
00:19:55,450 --> 00:19:55,991
Right?
And,

346
00:19:55,991 --> 00:19:57,090
and,
and it's also said,

347
00:19:57,091 --> 00:19:58,050
well,
if you're young,

348
00:19:58,051 --> 00:19:58,884
then you believe in these views,
but then you grow up and you grow over 

349
00:20:01,141 --> 00:20:02,850
it.
I had never grown over it.

350
00:20:02,970 --> 00:20:07,970
I think that that aspect of the mind,
uh,

351
00:20:08,310 --> 00:20:09,143
the ability to think through decisions 
is one that I will credit the Indian 

352
00:20:15,331 --> 00:20:18,780
culture and my father for endowing in 
me.

353
00:20:18,910 --> 00:20:20,110
Yeah.
Well you'll be happy to know,

354
00:20:20,111 --> 00:20:22,090
as I mentioned to you before that you 
know,

355
00:20:22,110 --> 00:20:22,943
I was at the students for liberty 
conference and I met several students 

356
00:20:25,661 --> 00:20:28,720
from India who were there that are 
involved with Iran,

357
00:20:28,721 --> 00:20:29,554
instituted in that consider themselves 
objective isn't all that and it seems 

358
00:20:31,661 --> 00:20:34,120
that some of those ideas at least are 
thriving there.

359
00:20:34,121 --> 00:20:36,490
So that brings it into the modern day.
Okay.

360
00:20:36,491 --> 00:20:37,324
So as I mentioned,
I really loved your bio and they were a 

361
00:20:38,681 --> 00:20:41,800
couple of great quotes in there.
So I want to read one directly to you.

362
00:20:41,801 --> 00:20:46,150
You said my passion is upward mobility 
integrated across intellectual,

363
00:20:46,151 --> 00:20:50,200
psychological and economic realms.
I cared deeply about growth.

364
00:20:50,470 --> 00:20:51,303
Achievement for me is measured not by 
the level you have attained as much as 

365
00:20:54,790 --> 00:20:56,350
the road you have traveled.
For me,

366
00:20:56,351 --> 00:20:57,184
the journey is the destination and I 
cared deeply about integrity as in the 

367
00:21:01,091 --> 00:21:04,960
whole of a person rather than the 
individual part.

368
00:21:05,410 --> 00:21:07,900
And I thought there's obviously a lot 
there,

369
00:21:08,050 --> 00:21:11,350
but it seems to me that this is sort of 
what we're missing these days.

370
00:21:11,351 --> 00:21:12,184
We've got people that are just screaming
at each other all the time that 

371
00:21:16,001 --> 00:21:19,120
everyone's pretending they're an expert 
in everything.

372
00:21:19,121 --> 00:21:21,730
Nobody sort of listening.
Um,

373
00:21:21,790 --> 00:21:23,740
you know,
I've been traveling with Jordan Peterson

374
00:21:23,741 --> 00:21:24,574
allowed who's talking so much about what
I think is such simple stuff in a 

375
00:21:27,611 --> 00:21:29,350
certain way,
although he's quite brilliant at it.

376
00:21:29,351 --> 00:21:32,620
You were talking about personal 
responsibility and being a full person.

377
00:21:32,830 --> 00:21:35,000
And I thought that that was really what 
you were getting to.

378
00:21:35,270 --> 00:21:36,810
Yes.
So,

379
00:21:36,811 --> 00:21:38,250
um,
what's the question?

380
00:21:38,410 --> 00:21:40,180
So the question is,
well,

381
00:21:40,181 --> 00:21:42,840
I guess I sort of know why you came to 
believe this,

382
00:21:42,970 --> 00:21:47,560
but we seem to have a real lack of an 
ability to be a full integral part

383
00:21:47,830 --> 00:21:48,663
these days.
I think in part it really relates to 

384
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:56,500
this entrepreneurial mindset and a 
growth mindset.

385
00:21:56,980 --> 00:21:59,860
And for me personally,
that is,

386
00:22:00,090 --> 00:22:04,990
um,
a perspective that is in some sense,

387
00:22:04,991 --> 00:22:07,780
selfish.
Let me explain by what I mean by that.

388
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:10,840
And I mean selfish in a very positive 
way here.

389
00:22:11,310 --> 00:22:14,200
Oh,
I am right now in endowed professor.

390
00:22:14,201 --> 00:22:16,150
I'll just give you an example of it,
right,

391
00:22:17,260 --> 00:22:22,260
and I get to mentor a lot of young minds
and many of them come to my office,

392
00:22:23,501 --> 00:22:25,950
particularly Phd Students,
uh,

393
00:22:26,140 --> 00:22:29,890
with this mindset of I know so much it 
is true,

394
00:22:29,950 --> 00:22:30,783
I know a lot,
but think about the interaction between 

395
00:22:34,870 --> 00:22:38,890
a student and a professor where if the 
professor says,

396
00:22:38,980 --> 00:22:39,813
I know everything,
you're my student and you're going to 

397
00:22:41,441 --> 00:22:45,040
learn from me.
It's a one way street.

398
00:22:45,910 --> 00:22:49,180
It's the student benefiting from the 
professor with that mindset.

399
00:22:49,450 --> 00:22:51,430
But how has the professor benefiting 
from it?

400
00:22:51,820 --> 00:22:54,340
Where is my learning?
Where is my growth?

401
00:22:54,850 --> 00:22:55,683
So in this conversation,
one of the ways that I approach this 

402
00:22:59,171 --> 00:23:04,171
relationship is I see you have to start 
this conversation thinking of each other

403
00:23:06,340 --> 00:23:09,700
as intellectual equals.
I may know more than you,

404
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:14,170
but especially in the realm of research 
which is creating new knowledge.

405
00:23:14,500 --> 00:23:15,333
I need you to have an questioning mind 
because what happens if you're saying 

406
00:23:21,191 --> 00:23:24,940
something that I want to challenge,
and after all in academia,

407
00:23:24,941 --> 00:23:25,774
we are in the marketplace for ideas.
If I challenge you and your mind 

408
00:23:29,621 --> 00:23:31,750
immediately shuts down because you say,
oh,

409
00:23:31,900 --> 00:23:34,960
Rajshree said this,
she's the expert professor.

410
00:23:34,961 --> 00:23:38,260
She knows everything and you're not 
going to challenge me,

411
00:23:38,920 --> 00:23:41,200
then you're not allowing yourself to 
learn.

412
00:23:41,230 --> 00:23:43,750
But more importantly,
if I know that about you,

413
00:23:44,110 --> 00:23:44,943
I'm going to shut myself down and I am 
going to send so myself from expressing 

414
00:23:50,211 --> 00:23:52,160
my ideas because I want your mind to be 
open.

415
00:23:52,161 --> 00:23:55,430
So now we both lose.
And the bold silenced ourselves.

416
00:23:55,670 --> 00:23:59,840
So this is just one example of where I 
think that this,

417
00:24:00,260 --> 00:24:01,093
um,
this focus on growth and on learning is 

418
00:24:03,981 --> 00:24:06,560
actually very liberating.
And in that sense,

419
00:24:06,561 --> 00:24:09,110
very selfish for me because now like 
with them is a two way street.

420
00:24:09,350 --> 00:24:12,380
I'm not just teaching,
I'm also learning how do you get

421
00:24:12,510 --> 00:24:17,510
over the concept that selfishness is 
somehow evil?

422
00:24:18,260 --> 00:24:20,210
That I think a lot of people believe 
this inherently.

423
00:24:20,211 --> 00:24:20,721
You say,
well,

424
00:24:20,721 --> 00:24:22,010
I'm selfish,
or they think,

425
00:24:22,011 --> 00:24:23,110
well,
you're evil.

426
00:24:23,490 --> 00:24:24,323
So this actually relates to one of this 
point about the lack of integration or 

427
00:24:29,901 --> 00:24:30,890
this,
uh,

428
00:24:31,210 --> 00:24:33,260
uh,
thinking about either or.

429
00:24:33,530 --> 00:24:38,480
So the common concept of selfishness is 
as in,

430
00:24:38,481 --> 00:24:39,314
well,
you're only thinking about yourself and 

431
00:24:41,061 --> 00:24:43,520
not thinking about the other.
Why,

432
00:24:43,700 --> 00:24:47,990
why does it have to be an eternal?
Why cannot it be a wind when trade,

433
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:52,400
which is fundamentally recognizing your 
dignity,

434
00:24:52,670 --> 00:24:55,100
my dignity,
your identity,

435
00:24:55,101 --> 00:24:58,250
my identity and knowledge that should 
we,

436
00:24:58,520 --> 00:25:00,650
you know,
right now you and I are talking,

437
00:25:00,890 --> 00:25:04,100
why are we sitting here and having this 
conversation other than the fact,

438
00:25:04,101 --> 00:25:05,640
of course that,
uh,

439
00:25:05,641 --> 00:25:06,351
you know,
we're,

440
00:25:06,351 --> 00:25:07,184
we're passionate about these ideas and 
we find that our time together is 

441
00:25:11,421 --> 00:25:12,254
meaningfully well spent.
So much enjoyment out of this 

442
00:25:15,981 --> 00:25:16,814
conversation is not at your expense.
Neither is what your gaining outfitted 

443
00:25:20,330 --> 00:25:21,290
my expense.
In fact,

444
00:25:21,291 --> 00:25:22,730
we're creating value together.

445
00:25:23,230 --> 00:25:24,950
But you brought it into this room 
because that.

446
00:25:25,060 --> 00:25:25,893
That's exactly right for me at least.
It's like in a way I'm doing something 

447
00:25:28,361 --> 00:25:29,950
selfish in that.
I'm doing my show.

448
00:25:29,951 --> 00:25:34,630
I'm bringing a guest on that will 
hopefully get people to watch.

449
00:25:34,631 --> 00:25:35,464
Right?
And you're here because you want your 

450
00:25:36,611 --> 00:25:37,444
ideas to spread.
The people that are watching this 

451
00:25:39,670 --> 00:25:42,430
hopefully are getting something out of 
it for themselves.

452
00:25:42,431 --> 00:25:43,264
I mean,
that's what people really need to 

453
00:25:43,601 --> 00:25:45,970
understand that that's what's integral 
about this.

454
00:25:45,971 --> 00:25:46,804
It doesn't mean we're taking from you.
It actually means that we're giving to 

455
00:25:49,541 --> 00:25:50,640
ourselves and something.

456
00:25:50,680 --> 00:25:52,450
Yes.
And so for me,

457
00:25:52,660 --> 00:25:53,493
this notion that selfishness means this 
brute that is just going to ride 

458
00:25:58,841 --> 00:25:59,674
roughshod over everybody else's rights 
and responsibility fundamentally does 

459
00:26:04,571 --> 00:26:09,571
not get to this idea that each of us 
have our right to live our lives the way

460
00:26:12,131 --> 00:26:16,330
we see best and you know,
take the consequences,

461
00:26:16,331 --> 00:26:18,400
good or bad,
all our decisions.

462
00:26:18,610 --> 00:26:19,443
How much of this do you think is about 
just whether people view humans 

463
00:26:22,121 --> 00:26:25,960
fundamentally as good or evil?
So if you fundamentally think people are

464
00:26:25,961 --> 00:26:27,760
evil and you say to someone,
be selfish,

465
00:26:27,761 --> 00:26:30,880
well then it is that they're going to 
run roughshod over everybody and destroy

466
00:26:30,881 --> 00:26:31,714
the environment and steal money and kill
people and all that versus if you 

467
00:26:35,051 --> 00:26:35,884
believe people are fundamentally good or
at least neutral than if they do 

468
00:26:39,041 --> 00:26:41,200
something for themselves,
it will potentially be

469
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:43,280
for themselves.
Me,

470
00:26:43,510 --> 00:26:48,510
the only evil is really the use of force
to,

471
00:26:49,550 --> 00:26:52,740
um,
throttle somebody else.

472
00:26:54,870 --> 00:26:55,703
You can do what you want to do.
So long as you're not infringing on 

473
00:26:59,970 --> 00:27:00,803
other people's rights and 
responsibilities and their ability to 

474
00:27:04,051 --> 00:27:04,884
live their life the way they do and 
indeed in a civil society that is the 

475
00:27:08,701 --> 00:27:09,534
fundamental respect that we all each 
other that I live my life the best way 

476
00:27:15,241 --> 00:27:16,074
that I think is done,
but I'm not going to impose my views on 

477
00:27:19,021 --> 00:27:21,630
you.
I may have a conversation with you about

478
00:27:21,631 --> 00:27:26,631
my views and you're free to agree or 
disagree with my views and free to agree

479
00:27:27,001 --> 00:27:27,834
or to interact or not with me,
but I can't force my views and my 

480
00:27:33,031 --> 00:27:35,370
beliefs on you and neither should you 
force.

481
00:27:35,371 --> 00:27:36,204
I mean that's fundamentally the 
conversation between my father and I 

482
00:27:39,210 --> 00:27:40,250
didn't think about it,
right.

483
00:27:40,560 --> 00:27:44,280
It is that we were both very aligned in 
our views 80 percent of the time,

484
00:27:44,281 --> 00:27:45,114
but the 20 percent where he thought that
as a father he had the right to tell me 

485
00:27:49,350 --> 00:27:50,183
what I should do as opposed to be the 
facilitator and guide an advisor to my 

486
00:27:55,441 --> 00:27:58,320
decisions.
That is the fundamental disconnect.

487
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:01,970
Do you think we spend too much time on 
that 20 percent or you know,

488
00:28:01,971 --> 00:28:02,804
I think I heard Barry Weiss on real time
called the narcissism of small 

489
00:28:05,031 --> 00:28:05,864
differences where we,
we can agree on almost everything 

490
00:28:08,630 --> 00:28:10,820
philosophically and then we find 
something.

491
00:28:10,940 --> 00:28:11,773
Yes.
And then that is what we focus on our 

492
00:28:13,401 --> 00:28:13,940
level

493
00:28:13,940 --> 00:28:18,690
and it really depends upon,
is that something in a hierarchy of your

494
00:28:18,691 --> 00:28:19,524
values,
a fundamental issue that you do need to 

495
00:28:23,781 --> 00:28:24,614
disagree on or is that something in the 
hierarchy of your values and your 

496
00:28:29,500 --> 00:28:34,500
beliefs?
Something that is not as critical to the

497
00:28:34,731 --> 00:28:38,420
conversation that we're having.
So I prefer a indeed.

498
00:28:38,421 --> 00:28:42,680
I am a big believer in win-win outcomes.
Um,

499
00:28:42,950 --> 00:28:44,000
I don't,
you know,

500
00:28:44,840 --> 00:28:46,970
my husband is my best friend.
I love him.

501
00:28:47,300 --> 00:28:50,410
The last thing I would want is for him 
to say Rajshree,

502
00:28:50,770 --> 00:28:54,140
I'm with you.
Not because it gives me any selfish joy,

503
00:28:54,470 --> 00:28:57,920
not because I get any pleasure.
I take pity on you.

504
00:28:58,100 --> 00:29:02,840
I feel sorry for you.
And that's why my life's objective is to

505
00:29:02,841 --> 00:29:05,600
take care of you.
Do you want a relationship?

506
00:29:05,690 --> 00:29:07,880
I walk out the door,
I'd say,

507
00:29:07,881 --> 00:29:12,881
if I am not giving you personal 
satisfaction and joy in being with me,

508
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:17,300
if I'm not your best friend,
just like your mind,

509
00:29:17,810 --> 00:29:18,643
then this relationship is not a win win 
and I don't want to be either an object 

510
00:29:22,671 --> 00:29:23,504
of charity or a or pity or A.
I don't want you to feel like you're 

511
00:29:28,971 --> 00:29:29,804
obligated,

512
00:29:30,230 --> 00:29:31,063
so I want to backup to say you said a 
few minutes ago about the way that you 

513
00:29:33,531 --> 00:29:38,531
teach and that exchange between 
professor and student where it's sort of

514
00:29:39,141 --> 00:29:41,030
you're trying to look at each other as 
equals.

515
00:29:41,140 --> 00:29:43,990
I might learn something from them and 
they might learn something from me.

516
00:29:43,991 --> 00:29:45,160
So.
So two parts of that.

517
00:29:45,280 --> 00:29:46,113
First all,
how often do you find that you actually 

518
00:29:47,111 --> 00:29:47,944
learned something?
Oh,

519
00:29:48,100 --> 00:29:49,780
every time.
Indeed.

520
00:29:50,590 --> 00:29:53,830
Last year,
University of Maryland honored me with a

521
00:29:53,831 --> 00:29:58,831
distinguished scholar teacher award and 
one of my first slides was about exactly

522
00:29:59,861 --> 00:30:00,694
that.
The debt that I owe to my advisor who 

523
00:30:04,360 --> 00:30:07,240
incidentally gave me away when Robin and
I got married.

524
00:30:07,241 --> 00:30:08,980
I remember my father wasn't talking to 
me.

525
00:30:09,160 --> 00:30:09,993
My advisor was my second father and so I
learned a lot from him and I have 

526
00:30:14,951 --> 00:30:18,850
benefited from that learning off a 
mentor advisor relationship,

527
00:30:19,060 --> 00:30:19,893
but I have benefited equally from paying
it forward so every one of my phd 

528
00:30:24,491 --> 00:30:25,324
students I can pinpoint to you exactly 
what ideas they helped me learn which 

529
00:30:32,501 --> 00:30:33,334
empirical context and innovative 
industries I went into along with them 

530
00:30:38,470 --> 00:30:39,303
and how my own scholarship has 
fundamentally benefited and even change 

531
00:30:44,501 --> 00:30:47,410
trajectories because of my phd students.

532
00:30:47,510 --> 00:30:48,343
So the second part of that then would be
do you think that is a real rarity on 

533
00:30:51,621 --> 00:30:52,454
college campuses these days that that 
professors are willing to learn from 

534
00:30:55,251 --> 00:30:58,670
students because when I go to colleges,
which I'm doing all the time now,

535
00:30:58,940 --> 00:30:59,773
one of the things I hear most is that 
students are actually afraid to 

536
00:31:02,721 --> 00:31:03,554
challenge their professors because they 
think it's going to hurt their grades 

537
00:31:06,050 --> 00:31:08,120
and that generally just generally 
speaking,

538
00:31:08,121 --> 00:31:12,350
this seems to come from more leftist 
professors that if you challenge them on

539
00:31:12,351 --> 00:31:13,184
intersectionality or or any of that,
that people actually think their grades 

540
00:31:17,211 --> 00:31:20,120
will suffer.
Do you think that that's

541
00:31:20,500 --> 00:31:23,030
a broad problem in academia?
It is.

542
00:31:23,420 --> 00:31:25,700
Unfortunately,
I,

543
00:31:25,880 --> 00:31:26,750
you know,
I,

544
00:31:26,980 --> 00:31:31,910
there is this part of me in my soul that
says that just cannot be true.

545
00:31:32,030 --> 00:31:37,030
Please let this not be true because the 
fundamental identity,

546
00:31:37,881 --> 00:31:42,881
often academic should be one which is 
focused on learning and focused on ideas

547
00:31:43,730 --> 00:31:48,730
and indeed I would say that one requires
a confidence and a self esteem and to be

548
00:31:50,421 --> 00:31:51,254
comfortable with being challenged and so
often I do have several colleagues that 

549
00:31:56,751 --> 00:31:57,584
I worry about in as much as they don't 
make good advisors and part of the 

550
00:32:01,971 --> 00:32:02,804
reason they don't make good advisors is 
not because they are not experts in 

551
00:32:06,201 --> 00:32:07,034
their sphere,
but precisely because they cannot stand 

552
00:32:11,541 --> 00:32:15,200
being challenged by their students and 
in my opinion,

553
00:32:15,260 --> 00:32:18,980
that's a lose lose.
Not only are you stymieing the students'

554
00:32:18,981 --> 00:32:21,260
growth,
you signing your own growth.

555
00:32:21,420 --> 00:32:22,253
Yeah.
So when you hear people talking about 

556
00:32:23,701 --> 00:32:24,534
the free speech issues on college 
campuses and at the conference that we 

557
00:32:27,571 --> 00:32:28,404
were at,
I mean there were literally hundreds of 

558
00:32:29,431 --> 00:32:32,490
professors there to talk about how do we
defend free speech.

559
00:32:32,491 --> 00:32:33,324
That was the whole purpose of it.
Do you sense that something has shifted 

560
00:32:36,991 --> 00:32:38,880
in the last couple of years?
Does it seem worse?

561
00:32:40,670 --> 00:32:44,450
I give you my own personal story.
About three years,

562
00:32:44,600 --> 00:32:45,433
two years ago,
I ended up writing an op Ed in the 

563
00:32:49,970 --> 00:32:53,360
Washington Post on confessions of a 
silenced professor.

564
00:32:55,010 --> 00:32:58,190
Now you've heard me these last 15,
20 minutes.

565
00:32:58,490 --> 00:33:01,910
Anyone that knows me says Rajshree you 
silence.

566
00:33:02,050 --> 00:33:04,100
Give me a break.
Easily silenced.

567
00:33:04,130 --> 00:33:04,963
Exactly.
And indeed part of the team off that 

568
00:33:07,970 --> 00:33:12,530
ipad was a very important self 
realization that I had.

569
00:33:12,950 --> 00:33:17,870
And that was a,
that I was now starting to think,

570
00:33:18,470 --> 00:33:19,303
do I really want to take this on?
And it was a colleague of mine who we 

571
00:33:25,431 --> 00:33:26,264
were just having a conversation about 
something that had happened at a 

572
00:33:28,401 --> 00:33:29,910
conference,
uh,

573
00:33:29,920 --> 00:33:32,060
and she said to me and I was like,
you know,

574
00:33:32,420 --> 00:33:33,253
I'm wondering,
should I weigh in on this or should I 

575
00:33:34,971 --> 00:33:38,810
just let it go?
And the point is not what the issue was.

576
00:33:38,990 --> 00:33:41,270
The point is that I even asked that 
question,

577
00:33:41,540 --> 00:33:43,790
which is what this colleague said to me,
she says,

578
00:33:43,791 --> 00:33:44,624
Rajshree,
when did you become so afraid of 

579
00:33:47,241 --> 00:33:48,140
speaking your mind?

580
00:33:48,470 --> 00:33:53,330
And that really hit me in my gut,
if you will.

581
00:33:53,630 --> 00:33:58,220
It's like,
when did I start thinking if I do this,

582
00:33:58,221 --> 00:34:01,370
what's going to be the fallout within 
the academic circles?

583
00:34:01,670 --> 00:34:02,503
Should I repress myself?
And that's when I realized that the 

584
00:34:04,611 --> 00:34:07,850
spiral of silence where we ended up.
So,

585
00:34:07,851 --> 00:34:09,620
you know,
you can talk about censorship.

586
00:34:09,920 --> 00:34:12,050
I actually think at the University of 
Maryland,

587
00:34:12,140 --> 00:34:16,250
I am in a great university president on 
down.

588
00:34:16,520 --> 00:34:21,520
We have a investment and a dedication to
words,

589
00:34:22,070 --> 00:34:22,903
freedom of speech,
and thinking about the academia as a 

590
00:34:25,281 --> 00:34:27,270
marketplace for ideas.
So great to hear it.

591
00:34:28,210 --> 00:34:29,320
I,
I mean,

592
00:34:29,321 --> 00:34:30,510
I just,
before I came here,

593
00:34:30,540 --> 00:34:33,050
I had a phenomenal conversation with the
president,

594
00:34:33,360 --> 00:34:34,193
uh,
regarding an event where we're worried 

595
00:34:35,691 --> 00:34:36,524
about whether or not there is going to 
be some backlash because of some of the 

596
00:34:39,081 --> 00:34:40,820
people I've been bringing in in a 
debate.

597
00:34:41,090 --> 00:34:45,530
But for us it's very important to have 
that reasoned and respectful discourse.

598
00:34:46,190 --> 00:34:48,150
But for me it was,
you know,

599
00:34:48,170 --> 00:34:51,140
people from the outside can tell you 
whatever they want.

600
00:34:51,141 --> 00:34:56,141
But when you start to silence yourself,
that's when you silence your mind.

601
00:34:56,480 --> 00:35:00,500
That's when you don't let your 
innovative creativity.

602
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:03,980
What is freedom of speech about it is 
not in the freedom to agree.

603
00:35:04,370 --> 00:35:08,360
It's the freedom to disagree,
but doing so in a manner,

604
00:35:08,361 --> 00:35:10,850
and again,
coming back to this use of force,

605
00:35:10,910 --> 00:35:13,520
right?
I can say what I want.

606
00:35:13,610 --> 00:35:14,930
I am not.
You know,

607
00:35:14,931 --> 00:35:17,660
I,
I in college campuses these days,

608
00:35:17,661 --> 00:35:19,040
one of the things that they say is,
well,

609
00:35:19,041 --> 00:35:21,800
words can hurt.
You know,

610
00:35:22,130 --> 00:35:25,250
I was in a convent and the teachers used
to say,

611
00:35:25,251 --> 00:35:29,210
sticks and stones can break my bones,
but words don't hurt me.

612
00:35:29,211 --> 00:35:30,650
Right?
And yes,

613
00:35:30,651 --> 00:35:35,651
words do have power.
I'm not denying that for sure.

614
00:35:35,811 --> 00:35:40,260
Several of the things that father said 
to me psychologically will very wounding

615
00:35:40,261 --> 00:35:41,094
and I had to work through that.
So I'm not denying the fact that words 

616
00:35:44,671 --> 00:35:48,120
in the psychological and intellectual 
ram are very powerful,

617
00:35:48,420 --> 00:35:49,253
but the point is,
is a fundamental difference between 

618
00:35:51,811 --> 00:35:52,644
words and coercion.
As in now I am forcing you to think 

619
00:35:57,241 --> 00:35:58,074
otherwise because words are 
fundamentally our minds thinking and 

620
00:36:03,301 --> 00:36:04,740
then communicating with each other.

621
00:36:05,100 --> 00:36:07,290
We've had a long sort of slippery road 
on this,

622
00:36:07,291 --> 00:36:08,124
right?
Where people are starting to think that 

623
00:36:08,971 --> 00:36:09,804
words mean action or that you have some 
sort of right to not be offended or a 

624
00:36:13,291 --> 00:36:15,760
right to comfort.
I mean you just simply don't have.

625
00:36:17,230 --> 00:36:19,120
I think actually,
oh,

626
00:36:19,170 --> 00:36:20,003
it's the converse is true.
You need to be courageous to look at 

627
00:36:25,771 --> 00:36:30,000
something and say,
this doesn't accord with my beliefs,

628
00:36:30,360 --> 00:36:31,193
so you know,
they.

629
00:36:31,350 --> 00:36:32,183
Let me use a different analogy out here.
People often talk about open versus 

630
00:36:35,791 --> 00:36:36,624
closed mine.
I actually think neither of those 

631
00:36:38,701 --> 00:36:39,534
concepts make sense because what is a 
closed mine that is the professor that 

632
00:36:43,231 --> 00:36:45,030
you and I were just talking about who 
says,

633
00:36:45,031 --> 00:36:46,830
I'm right?
How dare you challenge me?

634
00:36:46,980 --> 00:36:49,140
I've made up my decision already.
Right?

635
00:36:49,380 --> 00:36:52,590
But an open mind is someone that's just 
sitting on the fence,

636
00:36:53,070 --> 00:36:56,640
not willing to take any kind of a 
committed stand.

637
00:36:56,910 --> 00:36:57,743
In fact,
I would prefer a close mind to an open 

638
00:36:59,551 --> 00:37:00,780
mind in that way.
Right?

639
00:37:00,990 --> 00:37:05,990
But what I really care about is an 
active mine that I have some opinions,

640
00:37:06,091 --> 00:37:06,924
some beliefs,
and they're based on the prior thinking 

641
00:37:10,501 --> 00:37:12,840
that I have done,
but I'm not omniscient.

642
00:37:13,080 --> 00:37:13,913
I'm not infallible.
I could have made mistakes in my 

643
00:37:16,681 --> 00:37:21,600
thinking,
so having an active mind allows me,

644
00:37:21,930 --> 00:37:25,800
the,
gives me the permission to say I do have

645
00:37:25,801 --> 00:37:26,634
these thoughts and beliefs,
but if someone provides me with 

646
00:37:30,661 --> 00:37:35,661
compelling evidence and compelling logic
that would make me change my thinking,

647
00:37:37,080 --> 00:37:40,440
then it isn't my best interests to do 
so.

648
00:37:41,340 --> 00:37:41,821
You know,
it's funny.

649
00:37:41,821 --> 00:37:42,654
I find I often,
I sit across brilliant people all the 

650
00:37:44,401 --> 00:37:47,430
time and every now and again someone 
dropped something that I think,

651
00:37:47,431 --> 00:37:48,264
wow,
that's what I've been trying to get to 

652
00:37:49,620 --> 00:37:50,453
active mind.
I mean I'm going to start using that 

653
00:37:51,631 --> 00:37:54,230
phrase because that's right.
You don't just want an open mind of,

654
00:37:54,600 --> 00:37:55,433
of endless nothing actually.
And you don't want to close my but an 

655
00:37:58,051 --> 00:37:59,040
active mind.
Keep.

656
00:37:59,070 --> 00:38:00,390
Keep working.
Yeah.

657
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:01,640
So I want to ask you one other thing on 
it.

658
00:38:01,660 --> 00:38:02,493
So then I really want to focus on all 
this stuff that you're teaching for the 

659
00:38:04,921 --> 00:38:09,180
whole second half.
What do you think the actual solution is

660
00:38:09,181 --> 00:38:10,380
related to this?
So if a,

661
00:38:10,410 --> 00:38:11,243
if a professor like you has this sudden 
need or fear of self censoring and I 

662
00:38:18,701 --> 00:38:19,534
get.
It's pretty obvious to me how open and 

663
00:38:20,940 --> 00:38:23,750
courageous you are inherently.
Um,

664
00:38:23,820 --> 00:38:26,910
what do you think the solution is?
And when we were at this conference,

665
00:38:26,911 --> 00:38:27,744
a lot of the professors were saying this
has to come from the donors because the 

666
00:38:31,051 --> 00:38:31,884
administrators at the schools cannot be 
brave enough if they think that their 

667
00:38:34,870 --> 00:38:39,100
jobs are on the line all the time.
But that the one way to do it is that if

668
00:38:39,101 --> 00:38:39,934
the donors are slowly turning off the 
money to professors that won't defend 

669
00:38:43,721 --> 00:38:47,380
free speech or administrators who won't 
back the professors who do that.

670
00:38:47,381 --> 00:38:48,520
That might be though

671
00:38:48,580 --> 00:38:50,710
the chain.
Does that make sense to you?

672
00:38:50,740 --> 00:38:52,210
Yes,
and I disagree with it,

673
00:38:52,940 --> 00:38:55,780
but let me explain to you why I disagree
with it.

674
00:38:56,410 --> 00:38:57,243
Oh,

675
00:38:59,340 --> 00:39:03,510
you cannot.
So this comes back to the first question

676
00:39:03,511 --> 00:39:07,410
you asked me.
Why do I focus on integrity and why do I

677
00:39:07,411 --> 00:39:08,244
think about economics,
which is money and donors along with 

678
00:39:11,701 --> 00:39:15,270
psychological and intellectual growth.
For me,

679
00:39:15,271 --> 00:39:19,160
you cannot have one without the other.
These are pieces of an entire,

680
00:39:19,560 --> 00:39:20,500
uh,
that,

681
00:39:20,510 --> 00:39:25,510
that fit together to make an integrated 
whole within academia.

682
00:39:25,590 --> 00:39:30,590
One always has to worry about the fact 
that you've got all of these pressures,

683
00:39:31,260 --> 00:39:34,710
pressures for conformity,
pressures for funding and resources that

684
00:39:34,711 --> 00:39:35,544
are coming in there would you really 
care about and which you cannot renege 

685
00:39:40,170 --> 00:39:45,170
if you are an intellectual entrepreneur,
which is truly what being in academia is

686
00:39:45,331 --> 00:39:46,164
all about.
Being an intellectual entrepreneur is 

687
00:39:48,630 --> 00:39:53,630
your unwavering focus on knowledge,
creating knowledge,

688
00:39:55,140 --> 00:39:56,910
and if I,
if I may say so,

689
00:39:56,930 --> 00:39:57,763
untruth

690
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:02,430
resources,
just like any venture capitalist,

691
00:40:02,431 --> 00:40:05,670
so this intellectual entrepreneur,
maybe a good analogy,

692
00:40:05,671 --> 00:40:10,020
actually venture capitalists provide you
with the financial resources,

693
00:40:10,350 --> 00:40:13,710
but they are complimentary resource 
providers.

694
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:18,000
They cannot tell you which direction 
should you go,

695
00:40:18,150 --> 00:40:23,150
nor should they right?
If you don't have that creative mindset,

696
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:24,593
that intellectual horsepower,
if you're not courageous enough to go 

697
00:40:27,661 --> 00:40:28,494
for that,
then any kind of pressure from the 

698
00:40:30,691 --> 00:40:31,524
venture capitalists is not going to help
nor are any kind of pivots and 

699
00:40:35,221 --> 00:40:36,054
directions and so on.
So the way I look at it is I do not and 

700
00:40:40,471 --> 00:40:45,471
will not ever change my research based 
on what donors may or may not give.

701
00:40:46,650 --> 00:40:47,483
On the contrary,
I will look for aligned to donors 

702
00:40:51,030 --> 00:40:53,850
because you cannot put the cart before 
the horse.

703
00:40:54,090 --> 00:40:54,923
You cannot put your purpose behind the 
money or the success metrics of your 

704
00:41:01,591 --> 00:41:02,424
purpose.
Your purpose has to drive all of the 

705
00:41:05,281 --> 00:41:10,200
other resources that you garner.
So if an administrator lacks courage,

706
00:41:10,290 --> 00:41:12,300
that's on the administrator first and 
foremost.

707
00:41:12,540 --> 00:41:15,420
If an academic lacks courage of 
conviction,

708
00:41:15,600 --> 00:41:16,433
that's on them.
You can have complimentary people 

709
00:41:20,160 --> 00:41:23,550
aligned with you kind of helping you 
along the way,

710
00:41:23,700 --> 00:41:28,230
but they cannot substitute for that 
fundamental drive that you need to have.

711
00:41:28,270 --> 00:41:31,000
All right?
So everything that we spent the first 30

712
00:41:31,001 --> 00:41:35,450
some odd minutes talking about,
it sort of leads to academic integrity.

713
00:41:35,780 --> 00:41:36,613
It sounds like to me that these,
that we need not only the students to 

714
00:41:40,401 --> 00:41:42,650
have some integrity,
but the administrators,

715
00:41:42,651 --> 00:41:44,660
that professors,
everything else,

716
00:41:44,690 --> 00:41:47,480
everyone at the university altogether.
Do you think that's a fair?

717
00:41:47,670 --> 00:41:49,820
That's what I expect you to do?
Absolutely.

718
00:41:49,821 --> 00:41:50,780
In fact,
um,

719
00:41:51,080 --> 00:41:56,080
I think that we often confuse the terms 
academic freedom and academic integrity.

720
00:41:57,170 --> 00:42:01,100
Would we really care about is academic 
integrity first and foremost,

721
00:42:01,400 --> 00:42:02,233
and academic integrity really means that
I'm not going to sell my soul or my 

722
00:42:06,471 --> 00:42:10,970
ideas based on the highest bidder.
I believe that,

723
00:42:10,971 --> 00:42:11,804
you know,
and this is again the search for truth 

724
00:42:12,860 --> 00:42:17,860
that requires integrity and then of 
course I have the freedom to collaborate

725
00:42:18,561 --> 00:42:19,394
with people,
including donors on areas where we find 

726
00:42:23,541 --> 00:42:26,630
mutually beneficial relationships and 
when,

727
00:42:26,631 --> 00:42:27,320
when trade.

728
00:42:27,320 --> 00:42:28,153
Yeah.
So one of the things that you talked 

729
00:42:29,091 --> 00:42:29,924
about,
and I referenced it earlier in one of 

730
00:42:30,891 --> 00:42:33,590
these quotes are that you really focused
on is upward mobility.

731
00:42:33,591 --> 00:42:34,424
Yes.
And it,

732
00:42:34,460 --> 00:42:35,293
I think it's particularly interesting 
right now because if you listen to some 

733
00:42:37,911 --> 00:42:38,744
of our political leaders,
it seems like we've sort of completely 

734
00:42:40,941 --> 00:42:44,030
lost the ability that we were separated 
by class and all that.

735
00:42:44,240 --> 00:42:47,150
You come from a place where upward 
mobility was very hard.

736
00:42:47,330 --> 00:42:48,163
Um,
it's gotten less hard as they've 

737
00:42:49,310 --> 00:42:53,210
embraced as India's embrace capitalism 
first.

738
00:42:53,211 --> 00:42:55,880
I guess in the most broad sense,
tell me why you think upward mobility is

739
00:42:55,881 --> 00:42:57,650
so important,
but more importantly,

740
00:42:57,830 --> 00:43:00,080
what's the state of it in America right 
now?

741
00:43:01,330 --> 00:43:05,950
So I actually think that we in the 
United States,

742
00:43:06,850 --> 00:43:11,850
focus on upward mobility as if this was 
a major problem in the US.

743
00:43:14,710 --> 00:43:19,600
Other countries are becoming more market
oriented than the United States.

744
00:43:19,870 --> 00:43:24,870
The United States still stands as the 
one place where you really,

745
00:43:25,931 --> 00:43:26,764
really have the ability to be upwardly 
mobile and I think that is the greatest 

746
00:43:31,750 --> 00:43:32,583
asset that the United States still have.
And I'm very proud to call this country 

747
00:43:36,821 --> 00:43:38,230
my country of choice.

748
00:43:38,550 --> 00:43:39,383
So let,
let's sit in that idea for a second 

749
00:43:40,561 --> 00:43:41,394
because I totally agree with it and it 
seems to me that all of the people who 

750
00:43:45,450 --> 00:43:46,283
say that's not true are missing,
that are laws here allow you to do 

751
00:43:51,991 --> 00:43:55,260
whatever you want with your life.
It doesn't mean that you are going to do

752
00:43:55,261 --> 00:43:56,094
it.
It doesn't mean that it's going to be 

753
00:43:56,461 --> 00:43:58,830
handed to you,
but as you just said,

754
00:43:58,831 --> 00:44:02,430
as an immigrant that came here,
that is become tremendously successful.

755
00:44:02,850 --> 00:44:04,680
You're living proof that you can do it.

756
00:44:04,940 --> 00:44:07,000
Absolutely.
And that still holds.

757
00:44:07,400 --> 00:44:08,233
In fact,
in some ways I think we so take these 

758
00:44:11,001 --> 00:44:16,001
laws for granted that we don't know what
the rest of the world is out there,

759
00:44:17,810 --> 00:44:21,560
so my daughters have grown up and been 
born in the United States,

760
00:44:21,561 --> 00:44:26,510
but I think that their biggest learning 
moments come when they leave the country

761
00:44:26,780 --> 00:44:31,710
and see things even in India today as 
they as it exists,

762
00:44:32,100 --> 00:44:32,933
these see the disparities of the things 
that they can take for granted were 

763
00:44:36,211 --> 00:44:37,044
Susan India,
but you still have to fight with the 

764
00:44:39,511 --> 00:44:40,344
corruption.
You still have to fight with these 

765
00:44:42,901 --> 00:44:43,734
status aspects.
The United States is very status free 

766
00:44:47,580 --> 00:44:51,780
relative to most other countries,
including India and there's a dignity to

767
00:44:51,781 --> 00:44:56,130
human labor here that is often missing 
in many other cultures.

768
00:44:56,760 --> 00:44:57,593
That is the aspect that I care about 
when I care about upward mobility and 

769
00:45:00,871 --> 00:45:02,400
you know what?
Let's be honest.

770
00:45:02,400 --> 00:45:07,400
Out here I did not have the kind of 
privileges that my daughters too.

771
00:45:10,570 --> 00:45:13,500
I could've been more on the fact that,
you know,

772
00:45:13,920 --> 00:45:14,753
I came from a country or from a 
traditional family values that I had to 

773
00:45:19,580 --> 00:45:20,413
have the family tradition.
There was such that I had to have this 

774
00:45:23,731 --> 00:45:27,570
fight that for sure defined me 
positively,

775
00:45:27,571 --> 00:45:28,404
but also class some psychological scars 
and of course my hope is that my 

776
00:45:30,931 --> 00:45:33,750
daughters don't go through that and I 
could go there and say,

777
00:45:33,751 --> 00:45:34,584
you know,
of the level at which they're starting 

778
00:45:35,761 --> 00:45:40,380
off is so much higher than the level I'm
starting off and are they privileged and

779
00:45:40,381 --> 00:45:41,214
look at all that I didn't have or I can 
focus their minds and their ideas and 

780
00:45:46,320 --> 00:45:47,610
you know,
you may start here,

781
00:45:48,150 --> 00:45:51,660
but the definition of your achievement 
is not your level,

782
00:45:52,020 --> 00:45:52,853
but where you end,
you find it fascinating that people are 

783
00:45:55,291 --> 00:45:57,390
constantly attacking that they are.

784
00:45:57,420 --> 00:46:00,510
They attack people that have a little 
bit more to start with,

785
00:46:00,690 --> 00:46:03,810
which is the whole point of life.
You want your children to have more.

786
00:46:05,650 --> 00:46:06,483
The only way that it would be fair it is
not because I can be raised to their 

787
00:46:12,721 --> 00:46:13,554
level.
The only way to do it is to bring them 

788
00:46:15,511 --> 00:46:17,970
down to the level that I started.
And is that fair?

789
00:46:18,510 --> 00:46:19,650
Right.
And so again,

790
00:46:19,860 --> 00:46:24,860
by focusing on the level that one starts
with as a measure,

791
00:46:24,900 --> 00:46:25,733
often individually achievement,
I think is not necessarily focusing on 

792
00:46:32,190 --> 00:46:35,340
their individual effort and a lot of 
people.

793
00:46:35,810 --> 00:46:37,050
Um,
even in India,

794
00:46:37,410 --> 00:46:38,430
um,
you know,

795
00:46:38,610 --> 00:46:39,443
as I said to you,
my father went from rags to riches and 

796
00:46:42,370 --> 00:46:45,150
there were a lot of people that,
that were my friends.

797
00:46:45,151 --> 00:46:49,020
Then we're quite rich and they had a 
very entitlement mentality.

798
00:46:49,880 --> 00:46:54,880
I don't think that they're any happier 
than I was even when I was poorer.

799
00:46:55,440 --> 00:46:57,330
So this comes back to the point that 
you,

800
00:46:57,331 --> 00:47:01,260
the quote that you had,
I can just measure a person's success by

801
00:47:01,261 --> 00:47:03,960
their economic riches.
You also happiness,

802
00:47:03,990 --> 00:47:07,200
which is what I care about,
is a state of mind.

803
00:47:07,201 --> 00:47:09,600
It's a state of consciousness that has 
to be earned.

804
00:47:10,050 --> 00:47:10,883
Self esteem then combined with the sense
of I'm a materially at a place that I'm 

805
00:47:17,821 --> 00:47:20,520
comfortable or rich,
but more than that,

806
00:47:20,521 --> 00:47:21,354
psychologically and intellectually,
I feel like I've made something of 

807
00:47:23,761 --> 00:47:24,594
myself.
I think that is something that is so 

808
00:47:26,521 --> 00:47:27,354
much more inspiring to go after money.
And Snyder used to say money is the 

809
00:47:31,121 --> 00:47:32,290
reward.
Not The reason,

810
00:47:32,790 --> 00:47:34,180
and I completely agree with that.

811
00:47:34,470 --> 00:47:35,303
Yeah,
it's so interesting because I've been 

812
00:47:36,041 --> 00:47:36,874
thinking about this a lot lately because
obviously the show is kind of catching 

813
00:47:39,881 --> 00:47:40,714
fire and I'm doing okay financially and 
we're building something good and I'm 

814
00:47:43,240 --> 00:47:44,073
traveling a lot.
People say Nice things to me all the 

815
00:47:45,611 --> 00:47:48,100
time and I've been thinking about that 
and people keep saying,

816
00:47:48,101 --> 00:47:48,934
well,
you're going to get some big offer from 

817
00:47:49,631 --> 00:47:51,920
one of these networks or something.
And it's like,

818
00:47:52,960 --> 00:47:54,880
I hope I do too,
but I love this.

819
00:47:54,881 --> 00:47:58,600
Like I'm actually happy now,
like I'm doing what I think I'm supposed

820
00:47:58,601 --> 00:48:02,710
to be doing and I don't know where that 
road goes,

821
00:48:03,100 --> 00:48:06,850
but looking at everything holistically,
it's not just about money,

822
00:48:06,851 --> 00:48:09,910
it's about doing something that gives 
you value at all that uh,

823
00:48:10,270 --> 00:48:12,970
but we,
we seem not to focus enough.

824
00:48:12,990 --> 00:48:14,190
But that's the point,
right?

825
00:48:14,191 --> 00:48:16,080
I get so much joy.
So again,

826
00:48:16,081 --> 00:48:17,610
to that quote that you were talking 
about,

827
00:48:17,611 --> 00:48:19,770
for me,
the journey is the destination.

828
00:48:20,520 --> 00:48:21,600
You know,
whether I would,

829
00:48:21,650 --> 00:48:25,350
I feel younger today than I did when I 
was 20 years old.

830
00:48:25,380 --> 00:48:26,213
And what's the big difference?
I feel like I have earned the self 

831
00:48:29,851 --> 00:48:30,684
esteem,
not recognition outside because people 

832
00:48:33,630 --> 00:48:34,463
you know and you know this,
you need a lot of people and they come 

833
00:48:36,811 --> 00:48:37,860
to you and say,
Hey Dave,

834
00:48:37,861 --> 00:48:41,790
you're so great,
but who is saying your great makes a big

835
00:48:41,791 --> 00:48:45,750
difference to you hearing whether you 
see what I mean.

836
00:48:45,751 --> 00:48:46,584
So there has to be a sense of do I 
believe that your saying I'm great for 

837
00:48:52,561 --> 00:48:56,730
the reasons that I value and if that is 
there,

838
00:48:56,731 --> 00:49:00,540
then I will take external adulation as a
positive.

839
00:49:00,570 --> 00:49:01,980
If not,
it's hollow.

840
00:49:01,981 --> 00:49:02,814
It's empty.
So self esteem is truly what one should 

841
00:49:05,881 --> 00:49:06,930
be striving for.

842
00:49:07,100 --> 00:49:07,933
Yeah.
Do you think at some level capitalism 

843
00:49:10,581 --> 00:49:11,414
and maybe the western world in a wider 
sense is suffering from success at the 

844
00:49:14,871 --> 00:49:19,610
moment that it almost seems like because
we've been so successful,

845
00:49:19,640 --> 00:49:20,473
we're now going to that place that we 
mentioned earlier where we're just 

846
00:49:22,311 --> 00:49:25,100
fighting over little differences were 
then.

847
00:49:25,250 --> 00:49:26,083
There's a lot of people right now.
I mean if you talk about socialism on 

848
00:49:28,431 --> 00:49:29,500
college campuses,
you'll,

849
00:49:29,540 --> 00:49:31,370
you'll sell out the room,
you know,

850
00:49:31,610 --> 00:49:32,990
and if you talk about.
Fortunately,

851
00:49:32,991 --> 00:49:33,824
I find when I go and I mostly talked to 
libertarian or capitalist or whatever 

852
00:49:37,101 --> 00:49:38,090
groups,
you know,

853
00:49:38,120 --> 00:49:39,980
we're,
we're doing quite well as well,

854
00:49:40,160 --> 00:49:40,993
but that the ideas that are completely 
contrary to everything you've just said 

855
00:49:44,301 --> 00:49:46,460
seemed to be gaining some momentum,

856
00:49:46,740 --> 00:49:48,960
so I don't think they're victims of our 
success.

857
00:49:49,290 --> 00:49:50,123
I think we're victims of the fact that 
we have never really sat down and 

858
00:49:54,661 --> 00:49:55,494
thought seriously about the reasons for 
our success and by eschewing that 

859
00:50:01,650 --> 00:50:06,650
intellectual thought and ideas that 
under underpin our success,

860
00:50:09,420 --> 00:50:11,700
we have actually sold our success.
Sure.

861
00:50:11,780 --> 00:50:13,550
How should we have done that?
Do you mean on that?

862
00:50:13,551 --> 00:50:16,700
Our politicians should have talked about
it more or you mean more in academia?

863
00:50:16,850 --> 00:50:19,040
I think it starts from k through 12 
education.

864
00:50:19,041 --> 00:50:24,041
Actually.
I think that we have taken this concept,

865
00:50:25,670 --> 00:50:26,503
uh,
we have short our mind in k through 12 

866
00:50:29,841 --> 00:50:30,674
education all the way through college 
and this comes back to your example of 

867
00:50:34,700 --> 00:50:39,700
the faculty advisor that does not want 
to be challenged by their students.

868
00:50:41,420 --> 00:50:44,210
When you have that mentality as a 
teacher,

869
00:50:44,211 --> 00:50:45,044
whether it's in k through 12 or as a 
professor in academia where I know what 

870
00:50:49,191 --> 00:50:50,024
is best and I am going to tell you what 
it is as opposed to facilitate your 

871
00:50:54,471 --> 00:50:55,304
learning process,
we are not training our students how to 

872
00:50:59,360 --> 00:51:00,193
think anymore.
We're not giving them the ability to 

873
00:51:04,131 --> 00:51:07,340
learn in the manner that they do.
I'll give you another example.

874
00:51:07,610 --> 00:51:12,610
Memorization caught off as a huge 
negative today,

875
00:51:14,120 --> 00:51:16,180
but you know,
um,

876
00:51:16,250 --> 00:51:18,830
Sir Anthony Leggett who wasn't about 
law.

877
00:51:18,920 --> 00:51:21,530
It was a Nobel laureate and a professor 
at Illinois,

878
00:51:21,531 --> 00:51:26,300
which is where I was give this inspiring
speech to middle schoolers one day.

879
00:51:26,810 --> 00:51:30,110
And the theme of it was,
the more you know,

880
00:51:30,350 --> 00:51:35,350
the more you know what you don't know.
Knowledge is a building on process.

881
00:51:38,210 --> 00:51:43,210
You have to learn first to then learn 
what you need to learn again.

882
00:51:43,700 --> 00:51:44,533
And so fostering that spirit in students
will then allow you to go back to first 

883
00:51:50,511 --> 00:51:53,300
principles.
So it's not about being an expert on any

884
00:51:53,301 --> 00:51:54,134
area,
but it's about any area that you choose 

885
00:51:56,211 --> 00:51:59,000
to go in there.
Don't just look at the outcomes.

886
00:51:59,001 --> 00:51:59,834
Don't just get the success factors and 
then try to emulate the symptoms if you 

887
00:52:04,461 --> 00:52:06,100
will,
or the the,

888
00:52:06,101 --> 00:52:06,934
the things that accompany success go 
down to the very fundamental levels of 

889
00:52:10,701 --> 00:52:11,534
what are the ideas and what are the 
first principles that enable success to 

890
00:52:15,261 --> 00:52:15,810
begin with.

891
00:52:15,810 --> 00:52:16,643
It's interesting because this seems to 
be a place where maybe technology has 

892
00:52:18,871 --> 00:52:19,704
harmed us because it's like instead of 
having a holistic and integral view of 

893
00:52:23,761 --> 00:52:25,290
really knowing what you're talking 
about,

894
00:52:25,291 --> 00:52:26,070
well,
what do we do?

895
00:52:26,070 --> 00:52:29,460
We Google it,
so maybe you'll get there,

896
00:52:29,461 --> 00:52:30,770
right?
Maybe you'll get there with Google,

897
00:52:30,930 --> 00:52:31,763
but you,
but you'll get just a quick answer 

898
00:52:32,731 --> 00:52:34,380
instead of going to the root of what you
mean.

899
00:52:34,990 --> 00:52:37,170
Where I'd say,
again,

900
00:52:37,171 --> 00:52:38,004
technology is a tool.
It does not absolve us of our 

901
00:52:43,951 --> 00:52:47,910
responsibility on how we use the tool.
I'm actually a huge fan of Google.

902
00:52:48,210 --> 00:52:50,520
Google scholar has made my life so much 
easier.

903
00:52:50,700 --> 00:52:54,060
I remember being a doctoral student and 
having to go through Lockwood,

904
00:52:54,061 --> 00:52:57,180
Lockwood Library in six feet of snow in 
Buffalo.

905
00:52:57,181 --> 00:52:58,140
Better,
right.

906
00:52:58,141 --> 00:52:58,974
If I wanted an answer to a question now,
google scholar allows me to do it in 

907
00:53:02,401 --> 00:53:03,234
seconds.

908
00:53:04,110 --> 00:53:05,130
Microfiche is

909
00:53:05,230 --> 00:53:08,650
exactly and I had to work with 
microfiche to do my data gathering,

910
00:53:08,990 --> 00:53:09,823
but,
but the point out here is I can use 

911
00:53:11,531 --> 00:53:16,531
google scholar to get just an amazing 
amount of knowledge at my fingertips.

912
00:53:17,740 --> 00:53:19,540
How great is that?
I mean,

913
00:53:19,541 --> 00:53:22,420
I am so thankful to technology to do 
that,

914
00:53:22,600 --> 00:53:23,433
but that does not absolve me of the of 
saying your is all of the pieces of 

915
00:53:28,141 --> 00:53:29,220
information.
In fact,

916
00:53:29,400 --> 00:53:33,750
I would say this age of information 
technology,

917
00:53:34,170 --> 00:53:35,003
the need of the mind to have judgment 
and to discern across all of these 

918
00:53:39,691 --> 00:53:42,450
pieces of information is at an all time 
high.

919
00:53:42,710 --> 00:53:43,543
Yeah,
so obviously you teach and you talk 

920
00:53:44,811 --> 00:53:47,750
about entrepreneurial spirit and 
entrepreneurship.

921
00:53:48,950 --> 00:53:49,783
One of the things that I think is 
fascinating related to technology right 

922
00:53:52,161 --> 00:53:52,994
now is that Peter Teal is leaving 
silicon valley because he feels that 

923
00:53:59,120 --> 00:54:02,120
collectivism leftism,
cultural Marxism,

924
00:54:02,150 --> 00:54:05,150
maybe you have some other phrases for 
whatever that is,

925
00:54:05,480 --> 00:54:06,313
has sort of crushed the ability to think
so that there isn't the creativity 

926
00:54:10,311 --> 00:54:12,140
coming out of silicon valley that there 
used to be,

927
00:54:12,170 --> 00:54:14,210
which is why we don't have that many new
apps anymore.

928
00:54:14,211 --> 00:54:15,044
We don't have that many new breaking 
technologies and he is a capitalist and 

929
00:54:18,801 --> 00:54:22,340
he's ironically moving to la to become 
freer,

930
00:54:22,341 --> 00:54:23,174
which is sort of where people don't 
think of us as a capitalist haven here 

931
00:54:25,791 --> 00:54:26,624
in California and La specifically.
Do you find that fascinating that that 

932
00:54:30,921 --> 00:54:35,921
silicon valley seems to lean so far left
and yet it's supposed to be the place of

933
00:54:35,931 --> 00:54:36,764
innovation?

934
00:54:37,040 --> 00:54:37,873
Now that you're saying that,
I just made a connection that I never 

935
00:54:39,921 --> 00:54:42,710
thought of.
My father represents exactly that.

936
00:54:42,711 --> 00:54:43,760
If you think about it,
right?

937
00:54:43,910 --> 00:54:44,743
He was very free market oriented as it 
came to the economic realm and being 

938
00:54:48,560 --> 00:54:49,393
entrepreneurial in terms of creating new
products and services and economic 

939
00:54:54,651 --> 00:54:58,040
riches,
but when it came time to thinking he was

940
00:54:58,041 --> 00:55:01,550
very traditionalist and I think that 
that bifurcation,

941
00:55:01,730 --> 00:55:04,220
this mindbody dichotomy,
if you will,

942
00:55:04,370 --> 00:55:07,460
is what's plaguing a lot of people right
now.

943
00:55:07,640 --> 00:55:08,473
So I am not an expert on silicon valley.
I have noticed of course that a lot of 

944
00:55:13,731 --> 00:55:15,020
people,
so facebook,

945
00:55:15,260 --> 00:55:18,620
I just.
I just saw mark Zuckerberg say something

946
00:55:18,621 --> 00:55:22,310
to the effect of you should have 
economic regulation and social media.

947
00:55:22,640 --> 00:55:27,640
It's like why you were successful is 
because you did not have any barriers to

948
00:55:31,371 --> 00:55:36,290
entry.
The best way to keep them monopoly is to

949
00:55:36,291 --> 00:55:38,690
have government regulation because 
again,

950
00:55:38,691 --> 00:55:40,330
that's the use of force,
right?

951
00:55:40,760 --> 00:55:45,760
If I cannot go into an industry because 
there is prohibition,

952
00:55:46,610 --> 00:55:50,630
so think about Uber and Uber had to deal
with in the taxi cab industry.

953
00:55:50,810 --> 00:55:51,643
Think about when airlines was not what 
we know it because there were just that 

954
00:55:55,191 --> 00:55:56,570
regulated carriers,
right?

955
00:55:56,870 --> 00:55:57,703
That's someone that monopoly and the 
best way for an entrepreneur who has 

956
00:56:04,250 --> 00:56:05,083
achieved success,
but now no longer wants to continue to 

957
00:56:08,480 --> 00:56:09,313
own their success is to say,
let me create barriers to entry through 

958
00:56:14,331 --> 00:56:15,164
government regulation so I can be 
protected by any entrepreneur such as 

959
00:56:21,290 --> 00:56:23,090
those days ago,
right.

960
00:56:23,530 --> 00:56:26,020
To then come and infringe on what I 
have.

961
00:56:26,250 --> 00:56:28,710
It's almost as if he's trying to protect
what he has.

962
00:56:29,160 --> 00:56:31,210
I think maybe the thing,
you know,

963
00:56:31,220 --> 00:56:34,260
it's so funny also how these things 
change because you know,

964
00:56:34,261 --> 00:56:37,020
15 years ago before uber,
when I lived in New York City,

965
00:56:37,021 --> 00:56:37,854
basically my whole adult life and people
would complain relentlessly about the 

966
00:56:40,051 --> 00:56:40,884
cabs.
They're all broken down and the drivers 

967
00:56:42,301 --> 00:56:43,134
are in friendly.
They don't pick you up if you're a 

968
00:56:45,001 --> 00:56:45,900
certain color,
et Cetera,

969
00:56:45,901 --> 00:56:48,090
et cetera.
Then Uber comes around,

970
00:56:48,360 --> 00:56:51,660
fixes a lot of these problems by 
ingenuity and now people are saying,

971
00:56:51,661 --> 00:56:54,060
you see what they did,
they put the cabs out of business.

972
00:56:54,061 --> 00:56:55,560
The same people who were upset

973
00:56:55,910 --> 00:56:58,830
first in Boston.
It's even worse in Boston,

974
00:56:59,190 --> 00:57:04,190
every uber or lyft ride has to be,
has to pay five cents of a surcharge and

975
00:57:06,690 --> 00:57:07,990
every,
you know,

976
00:57:08,540 --> 00:57:09,373
a fraction of that.
I don't remember whether it's two cents 

977
00:57:11,341 --> 00:57:12,290
or three cents,
but you know,

978
00:57:12,300 --> 00:57:15,870
it adds up and millions of right goals 
to the taxi cab industry.

979
00:57:16,750 --> 00:57:17,583
That's the industry that's actually 
being replaced by doing a much better 

980
00:57:20,301 --> 00:57:21,230
service.
Yes,

981
00:57:21,290 --> 00:57:22,160
yes,
exactly.

982
00:57:22,370 --> 00:57:23,203
So that just.
So then is there a flaw in capitalism 

983
00:57:24,921 --> 00:57:25,754
there somehow because that there's 
probably some cronyism that's allowing 

984
00:57:29,691 --> 00:57:31,640
the politicians to write these 
ridiculous

985
00:57:32,530 --> 00:57:33,363
is not about markets.
Cronyism is about state isn't cronyism 

986
00:57:37,920 --> 00:57:38,753
is not capitalism at work.
It is government regulation at work and 

987
00:57:44,250 --> 00:57:46,020
this comes back to,
you know,

988
00:57:47,190 --> 00:57:48,420
Dave,
you're successful.

989
00:57:50,460 --> 00:57:53,910
I take pride in watching your videos,
somebody because I enjoy it,

990
00:57:54,300 --> 00:57:59,300
but I'm sure is a bit of envy to about,
Gee,

991
00:57:59,731 --> 00:58:04,731
I wish I could be as eloquent as David 
and as the 500,000

992
00:58:07,531 --> 00:58:10,060
people that watched the day Reuben show,
you know,

993
00:58:10,200 --> 00:58:11,033
wow,
wouldn't I love to have that kind of an 

994
00:58:13,111 --> 00:58:15,870
impact?
Now that's envy on my part.

995
00:58:16,980 --> 00:58:21,980
There are two things I could do,
it can either be a positive driver of my

996
00:58:22,861 --> 00:58:27,060
energies,
I could say I want what Dave does has,

997
00:58:27,090 --> 00:58:30,990
but I don't have,
and that can put me on a growth mindset,

998
00:58:31,620 --> 00:58:35,490
entrepreneurial mindset.
What is it that I need to do in order to

999
00:58:35,491 --> 00:58:38,370
achieve those success factors?
Going back to those principles,

1000
00:58:38,520 --> 00:58:39,353
what are the reasons behind Dave success
and what can I do to emulate or do 

1001
00:58:43,291 --> 00:58:47,070
differently than dave or I can say,
no,

1002
00:58:47,880 --> 00:58:51,240
I want what Dave has,
but I don't need to own it.

1003
00:58:51,270 --> 00:58:52,103
I don't need to do that.
So let me get the government to take 

1004
00:58:55,201 --> 00:58:58,500
some of what Dave has some of Dave's 
sponsorship,

1005
00:58:58,501 --> 00:58:59,334
right?
And that's what income inequality and 

1006
00:59:01,321 --> 00:59:02,154
redistribution is all about.
I'm taking some of your viewership and 

1007
00:59:05,221 --> 00:59:08,760
I'm going to be forcing those people to 
now listen to me.

1008
00:59:08,970 --> 00:59:11,820
So that's where we're using government 
force.

1009
00:59:11,850 --> 00:59:12,683
Whether it's income redistribution or 
any kind of yardstick of value where 

1010
00:59:17,071 --> 00:59:19,620
we're redistributing,
we're saying we're going to take it from

1011
00:59:19,621 --> 00:59:23,030
you and that actually negates your 
viewers rights.

1012
00:59:23,031 --> 00:59:23,864
Right?
Because now if I have the government 

1013
00:59:25,101 --> 00:59:28,070
saying that,
then some of them would be forced to not

1014
00:59:28,071 --> 00:59:31,190
watch you,
but watch me on the other hand,

1015
00:59:31,790 --> 00:59:32,960
this jealousy,
by the way,

1016
00:59:32,961 --> 00:59:34,760
the difference between envy and 
jealousy.

1017
00:59:34,761 --> 00:59:38,660
One of my colleagues just told me 
recently and we is when I want something

1018
00:59:38,661 --> 00:59:39,494
I don't have jealousy,
is when I want to keep something that I 

1019
00:59:42,591 --> 00:59:45,320
have,
but I'm being threatened against,

1020
00:59:45,530 --> 00:59:46,040
right?

1021
00:59:46,040 --> 00:59:47,930
Again,
positive or negative.

1022
00:59:48,110 --> 00:59:52,250
If I feel jealousy because I feel 
threatened about what I'm about to lose,

1023
00:59:52,460 --> 00:59:56,510
I can go ahead and say what is it that I
need to do in order to keep it?

1024
00:59:56,900 --> 01:00:01,340
Or I can create barriers and say you can
have it through the use of force.

1025
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:02,833
The same principles.
I work at cronyism at both sides of the 

1026
01:00:06,030 --> 01:00:06,863
yardstick.
So when we talk about relative poverty 

1027
01:00:09,201 --> 01:00:11,750
in the United States as an income 
inequality,

1028
01:00:11,930 --> 01:00:14,660
by the way coming from India,
I know what true poverty is.

1029
01:00:14,960 --> 01:00:15,793
We in the United States,
the minimum level of poverty here is so 

1030
01:00:19,611 --> 01:00:22,690
much better than the rest of the world.
So if we care,

1031
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:24,530
again,
it's about inbeat.

1032
01:00:24,950 --> 01:00:28,520
These rich people have what I don't have
and I should get them,

1033
01:00:28,800 --> 01:00:33,140
or on the rich end of the spectrum,
I have this as a welder.

1034
01:00:33,550 --> 01:00:34,383
I'm a person regardless of whether I got
it out of an inheritance or because of 

1035
01:00:38,541 --> 01:00:41,510
prior entrepreneurial thinking,
it's being threatened,

1036
01:00:41,660 --> 01:00:42,493
but I want to keep it for myself.
So the best way for me to do that is to 

1037
01:00:45,171 --> 01:00:49,220
lobby the government and erect barriers 
to entry on both sides.

1038
01:00:49,640 --> 01:00:50,473
The use of governmental regulation to 
respond to envy and jealousy is a 

1039
01:00:56,421 --> 01:00:57,254
negative,
not a positive driver of economic 

1040
01:00:59,781 --> 01:01:00,614
growth.

1041
01:01:00,850 --> 01:01:01,683
So where do you,
where do you draw the line or where is 

1042
01:01:03,461 --> 01:01:06,850
the starting point then of what 
government is supposed to do?

1043
01:01:07,020 --> 01:01:07,853
A government has a legal monopoly on 
force as it should because you and I in 

1044
01:01:13,291 --> 01:01:14,124
a civil society cannot focus our mind,
our effort on creating value if we're 

1045
01:01:21,570 --> 01:01:26,570
always going to worry about somebody 
looting or taking things away from us.

1046
01:01:27,060 --> 01:01:29,190
Right?
So I am not an anarchist.

1047
01:01:29,310 --> 01:01:32,040
I believe in governments.
I believe in the rule of law.

1048
01:01:32,280 --> 01:01:33,113
I believe in the protection.
So there are basic functions of the 

1049
01:01:37,471 --> 01:01:38,304
government that absolutely are essential
beyond that keep the economy away from 

1050
01:01:46,171 --> 01:01:47,004
the realm of the government because the 
government's only ability to do 

1051
01:01:50,251 --> 01:01:54,350
something is to say you and your best 
judgment.

1052
01:01:54,351 --> 01:01:58,320
I think you should go a I am telling you
you need to go be,

1053
01:01:59,760 --> 01:02:04,760
you're forcing the mind to not think or 
act on their best judgment.

1054
01:02:06,450 --> 01:02:07,820
Yeah.
So it's interesting in the,

1055
01:02:07,821 --> 01:02:08,654
in the case of Uber and what you were 
describing in Boston and the penny's 

1056
01:02:11,070 --> 01:02:11,903
going back to the,
to the cabbies who have nothing to do 

1057
01:02:13,471 --> 01:02:14,304
with it.
That actually is because of regulation 

1058
01:02:16,740 --> 01:02:17,573
and that the,
and the only way to that and let new 

1059
01:02:20,281 --> 01:02:23,790
businesses thrive is let them thrive.
Let me just let,

1060
01:02:24,060 --> 01:02:25,380
just let them,
let them know.

1061
01:02:25,800 --> 01:02:26,611
Um,
all right.

1062
01:02:26,611 --> 01:02:27,444
So there's a couple more things that I 
want to do with you and you had a four 

1063
01:02:30,840 --> 01:02:31,673
questions about personal leadership.
Then you ask a lot of your students and 

1064
01:02:34,501 --> 01:02:37,320
I thought that these were really great 
at it and it really,

1065
01:02:37,321 --> 01:02:40,980
this I think sort of puts a nice bow on 
everything that we've talked about here.

1066
01:02:41,160 --> 01:02:43,200
So the first one is what is your 
purpose?

1067
01:02:43,560 --> 01:02:45,930
Kids must be kids.
Students must be.

1068
01:02:46,290 --> 01:02:47,123
They must look at you Kinda Kinda 
curiously when you asked it that one 

1069
01:02:49,500 --> 01:02:50,420
because that's a.
that's a big.

1070
01:02:50,760 --> 01:02:51,593
So that means spend two seconds just 
telling you about why I came up with 

1071
01:02:53,741 --> 01:02:54,580
this framework.
Yeah.

1072
01:02:54,850 --> 01:02:55,683
I'm a strategy and entrepreneurship 
professor and I was asked to teach in a 

1073
01:03:00,791 --> 01:03:01,624
program which was largely minority,
high school student based and I was 

1074
01:03:06,941 --> 01:03:07,774
asked to give a lecture on strategic 
management and strategic management is 

1075
01:03:11,021 --> 01:03:11,854
typically the realm of ceos.
How can highschoolers identify and 

1076
01:03:18,550 --> 01:03:22,180
associate with questions that a CEO has 
to deal with.

1077
01:03:22,240 --> 01:03:23,073
That was the big challenge that I had.
How am I supposed to talk to them about 

1078
01:03:26,080 --> 01:03:26,913
at that time with Steve Jobs is doing 
for apple even though they recognize 

1079
01:03:29,771 --> 01:03:34,240
apple and make it real to them and I 
realize I didn't need to do that.

1080
01:03:35,020 --> 01:03:35,853
I could say to them especially because 
they're at the cusp of identifying who 

1081
01:03:40,061 --> 01:03:40,894
they are and creating their identity.
You're the CEO of [inaudible] 

1082
01:03:44,420 --> 01:03:47,860
incorporated.
Are you thinking like a ceo?

1083
01:03:48,430 --> 01:03:53,430
What are the four fundamental questions 
that a CEO should ask and are you asking

1084
01:03:54,911 --> 01:03:59,020
those questions of yourself?
And it begins with the first one is what

1085
01:03:59,021 --> 01:04:01,840
is your purpose?
The second is,

1086
01:04:01,870 --> 01:04:04,660
what does success look like?
The third is,

1087
01:04:04,750 --> 01:04:05,583
what's my value proposition given that 
that's my purpose and that's what 

1088
01:04:08,801 --> 01:04:11,920
success looks like.
And then finally in this stumps a lot of

1089
01:04:11,921 --> 01:04:12,754
people with whom should I trade?
So these four questions I think are the 

1090
01:04:17,200 --> 01:04:18,033
essence of any entrepreneurial 
individual or any entrepreneurial 

1091
01:04:22,481 --> 01:04:23,314
organization.

1092
01:04:23,720 --> 01:04:26,540
How often when you ask these students 
these questions,

1093
01:04:26,541 --> 01:04:28,730
did they have some good answers?
Oh my gosh,

1094
01:04:28,731 --> 01:04:29,980
these are tough.
I mean these ones,

1095
01:04:29,990 --> 01:04:31,850
your purpose,
these are the questions of all time,

1096
01:04:31,851 --> 01:04:32,684
right?
You're asking them in the framework of 

1097
01:04:33,651 --> 01:04:34,820
business and entrepreneurship.

1098
01:04:35,380 --> 01:04:37,000
Actually,
so I,

1099
01:04:37,001 --> 01:04:39,850
I,
I'm actually agnostic about whether they

1100
01:04:39,851 --> 01:04:40,684
want to define what is your purpose as 
it relates to their career or as it 

1101
01:04:44,321 --> 01:04:45,154
relates to their life,
but the answers that I provide them in 

1102
01:04:48,311 --> 01:04:49,144
the context of thinking and you wouldn't
be amazed as to how much this resonates 

1103
01:04:55,450 --> 01:04:57,850
all the way from beginning high 
schoolers,

1104
01:04:57,851 --> 01:05:02,851
including my own daughter who was forced
to take this class with me to executives

1105
01:05:04,421 --> 01:05:05,254
in my executive Mba.
So what is your purpose really requires 

1106
01:05:08,681 --> 01:05:13,681
people to think about what problems do I
want to solve that are meaningful to me.

1107
01:05:15,250 --> 01:05:16,083
So it again comes to making world a 
better place to live by doing something 

1108
01:05:20,021 --> 01:05:22,420
important to yourself.
And you know,

1109
01:05:22,421 --> 01:05:22,931
people say,
oh,

1110
01:05:22,931 --> 01:05:25,060
making the world a better place to live 
or come on rush,

1111
01:05:25,061 --> 01:05:25,630
hurry.
Right?

1112
01:05:25,630 --> 01:05:27,250
But what is,
what is your world,

1113
01:05:27,251 --> 01:05:28,810
Dave?
What is my world?

1114
01:05:28,960 --> 01:05:29,793
It's the places you go,
the people you meet and the things that 

1115
01:05:32,471 --> 01:05:35,620
you do.
And if in doing these three things,

1116
01:05:35,830 --> 01:05:39,370
you have solved the problem and made it 
a better place,

1117
01:05:39,490 --> 01:05:43,060
then you've made a world a better place.
But you've done it by focusing on things

1118
01:05:43,061 --> 01:05:46,600
that are important to you.
So it's interesting you're talking about

1119
01:05:46,601 --> 01:05:48,580
all these things through the business 
lens,

1120
01:05:48,581 --> 01:05:49,414
but business,
what you're talking about is what you 

1121
01:05:51,251 --> 01:05:52,084
said before,
which is,

1122
01:05:52,240 --> 01:05:53,590
which is happiness.
Yes,

1123
01:05:53,650 --> 01:05:55,540
absolutely.
And in fact,

1124
01:05:55,570 --> 01:05:57,970
on that point.
So what does success look like?

1125
01:05:57,971 --> 01:05:58,804
To me it is the ability to say I love 
what I do and I'm good at it because 

1126
01:06:04,391 --> 01:06:08,170
that's the word.
Choose spiral that enables self esteem.

1127
01:06:08,410 --> 01:06:10,960
And when you have self esteem because 
you're good at something,

1128
01:06:11,170 --> 01:06:13,630
you want to invest in it to become even 
better at it.

1129
01:06:14,320 --> 01:06:17,050
It's pretty cool waking up with that,
with that feeling.

1130
01:06:17,080 --> 01:06:19,540
So that was number two.
What does success look like?

1131
01:06:19,541 --> 01:06:21,400
You mentioned all of them already,
but I just want to read a little bit.

1132
01:06:21,520 --> 01:06:25,440
So what is your value proposition?
So notice that,

1133
01:06:25,670 --> 01:06:27,730
uh,
the answer to the question,

1134
01:06:27,731 --> 01:06:31,330
what does success look like?
Takes an inward perspective,

1135
01:06:31,510 --> 01:06:35,950
what do I love?
And then what are my abilities that will

1136
01:06:35,951 --> 01:06:40,390
help get me to where I love and what I'm
good at?

1137
01:06:41,170 --> 01:06:44,740
What is my value proposition is still 
looking at your abilities,

1138
01:06:44,890 --> 01:06:48,820
but now the yard stick is how is it 
creating value to you?

1139
01:06:49,180 --> 01:06:51,640
So can you say,
I love enterprise and innovation,

1140
01:06:51,670 --> 01:06:53,350
right?
I love what I do.

1141
01:06:53,650 --> 01:06:55,210
I think I'm,
I'm pretty good at it.

1142
01:06:55,211 --> 01:06:57,940
Are pretty good.
I come up every morning with a spring in

1143
01:06:57,941 --> 01:06:58,774
my step.
But why would that cause you to want to 

1144
01:07:01,121 --> 01:07:01,841
use,
you know,

1145
01:07:01,841 --> 01:07:02,674
ask Rajshree to join you this morning as
opposed to multiple other people that 

1146
01:07:07,121 --> 01:07:07,480
you do.

1147
01:07:07,480 --> 01:07:12,480
So what's my value proposition to you?
What benefit do I offer you?

1148
01:07:13,050 --> 01:07:13,883
The features that are unique to me that 
is the focus on value proposition and 

1149
01:07:18,610 --> 01:07:19,443
it's obvious because we have the 
evidence right here because of all the 

1150
01:07:21,821 --> 01:07:24,510
people that I talked to that weekend.
Uh,

1151
01:07:24,550 --> 01:07:25,383
you were one of,
I think two people who I said to the 

1152
01:07:27,191 --> 01:07:29,560
learn liberty guys,
we're going to get her up the show.

1153
01:07:30,200 --> 01:07:33,400
You came up to me after we had a great 
conversation about all of this stuff and

1154
01:07:33,401 --> 01:07:35,380
they go and then finally,
uh,

1155
01:07:35,650 --> 01:07:37,420
with,
who should I train?

1156
01:07:37,860 --> 01:07:41,740
That is the one thing that stumps a lot 
of people and uh,

1157
01:07:42,160 --> 01:07:42,993
goes back to the what is my purpose,
making the world a better place to live 

1158
01:07:48,910 --> 01:07:50,890
by doing something important to me,
right?

1159
01:07:51,190 --> 01:07:52,023
So providing benefit to someone else,
but making sure that I'm benefiting and 

1160
01:07:56,921 --> 01:08:01,660
I'm doing something I love to the answer
to what does success look like is really

1161
01:08:01,661 --> 01:08:03,790
getting to what you love doing,
which is about you.

1162
01:08:04,390 --> 01:08:08,260
The answer to your value proposition is 
providing benefit to someone else,

1163
01:08:08,350 --> 01:08:10,030
right?
Making the world a better place to live,

1164
01:08:10,390 --> 01:08:14,110
with whom do you trade is bringing those
two together.

1165
01:08:14,560 --> 01:08:18,770
So you and I are trading right now.
We may not be exchanging any dollars,

1166
01:08:18,800 --> 01:08:19,633
but there's a trade going on out here 
and that relates to your abilities and 

1167
01:08:23,361 --> 01:08:24,194
your aspirations and my abilities and my
aspirations and were combined together 

1168
01:08:28,821 --> 01:08:29,654
with a common objective.
So the alignment of your aspirations in 

1169
01:08:33,201 --> 01:08:35,990
my abilities are what's going to 
determine our actions.

1170
01:08:36,290 --> 01:08:39,680
And in doing so,
I get to do what I love doing.

1171
01:08:39,890 --> 01:08:43,810
I also you a benefit.
So do you and its amendment trade.

1172
01:08:44,060 --> 01:08:46,130
Well,
I got to do what I love doing here.

1173
01:08:46,131 --> 01:08:49,670
I feel that we,
I think we did almost everything.

1174
01:08:50,030 --> 01:08:51,650
Is there anything that we possibly 
missed?

1175
01:08:52,290 --> 01:08:53,123
This was,
this was truly a pleasure because this 

1176
01:08:54,501 --> 01:08:55,334
was exactly what I've tried to do in my 
life and with this show and everything 

1177
01:08:58,341 --> 01:08:59,250
else,
and you're,

1178
01:08:59,340 --> 01:09:02,240
you just exude exactly what you're 
talking about,

1179
01:09:02,241 --> 01:09:03,440
which is a joy to see.

1180
01:09:03,500 --> 01:09:04,550
Yes.
And in fact,

1181
01:09:04,551 --> 01:09:06,890
that's exactly why I want to trade with 
you.

1182
01:09:06,891 --> 01:09:08,390
I love that,
right?

1183
01:09:08,600 --> 01:09:13,600
Because you exude the same positive can 
do sense of life and I would rather have

1184
01:09:15,711 --> 01:09:20,711
people around me that have that same 
spirit make me better,

1185
01:09:21,140 --> 01:09:25,850
make me more energized than people that 
either I bring down or they bring down,

1186
01:09:25,930 --> 01:09:26,760
uh,
you know,

1187
01:09:26,760 --> 01:09:27,540
do they bring me.

1188
01:09:27,540 --> 01:09:30,010
Can we do a live event together?
Can we do something I knew,

1189
01:09:30,580 --> 01:09:32,670
Marilyn,
we're going to make something happen.

1190
01:09:32,671 --> 01:09:33,510
Sounds good.
This was,

1191
01:09:33,570 --> 01:09:35,550
this was truly a pleasure.
I'm glad it happened.

1192
01:09:35,551 --> 01:09:37,740
After a couple of months.
