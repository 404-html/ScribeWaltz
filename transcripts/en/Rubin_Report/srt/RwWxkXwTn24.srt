1
00:00:05,060 --> 00:00:07,040
Alright,
people were taking a break from politics

2
00:00:07,041 --> 00:00:09,830
this weekend we're going to focus on the
f word.

3
00:00:10,070 --> 00:00:12,500
That's right food.
They say,

4
00:00:12,501 --> 00:00:14,540
you are what you eat,
and if that's true,

5
00:00:14,541 --> 00:00:18,170
a lot of us are half hot dog,
half pizza and half ice cream.

6
00:00:18,470 --> 00:00:19,303
I know that that's three halves,
but we're a pretty fat group of people 

7
00:00:21,351 --> 00:00:23,930
these days.
Every week there's a new diet to follow,

8
00:00:23,931 --> 00:00:27,710
a new oil to avoid or a new super food 
that'll change your life.

9
00:00:27,740 --> 00:00:31,670
Then the week after that we usually find
out that the new revolutionary diet will

10
00:00:31,671 --> 00:00:32,504
actually make you gain weight.
You actually need that oil to live and 

11
00:00:35,241 --> 00:00:36,074
the superfood does absolutely nothing at
an endless slew of magazines to the 

12
00:00:39,501 --> 00:00:40,334
countless websites and blogs devoted to 
keeping you clicking on the newest fad 

13
00:00:43,730 --> 00:00:46,730
and it becomes almost impossible to 
figure out what you should eat.

14
00:00:47,420 --> 00:00:49,370
As those of you follow me on social 
media.

15
00:00:49,370 --> 00:00:50,203
No,
I'm in the midst of a little diet 

16
00:00:50,961 --> 00:00:51,950
myself.
Right now.

17
00:00:52,010 --> 00:00:52,843
I'm doing a slow carb Paleo Diet,
which is a slightly modified version of 

18
00:00:57,321 --> 00:01:00,650
what form of Rubin report guest Tim 
Ferriss helped popularize.

19
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:02,450
Basically,
I'm eating only meat,

20
00:01:02,451 --> 00:01:05,660
fish and veggies with no sugar and very 
limited carbs.

21
00:01:05,930 --> 00:01:06,763
I'm even putting grass fed butter in my 
coffee to get an extra boost of fat and 

22
00:01:10,581 --> 00:01:13,310
energy in the morning as I'm taping this
direct message.

23
00:01:13,311 --> 00:01:14,144
I've lost about five pounds in 10 days,
although I've also punched for random 

24
00:01:17,691 --> 00:01:19,790
strangers on the street for looking at 
me the wrong way,

25
00:01:20,030 --> 00:01:22,190
but as they say,
everything in moderation.

26
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:25,340
Of course,
what you should or shouldn't put in your

27
00:01:25,341 --> 00:01:28,880
body isn't just about weight.
It's also about your mind,

28
00:01:28,881 --> 00:01:31,760
and this is a place where the science is
actually pretty solid.

29
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:32,833
The foods that we eat or don't eat can 
have a tremendous effect on our brain 

30
00:01:36,231 --> 00:01:37,064
itself,
right down to our ability to think as 

31
00:01:39,141 --> 00:01:39,974
we've seen a spike in degenerative brain
diseases such as Alzheimer's and 

32
00:01:43,011 --> 00:01:43,844
Parkinson's disease,
which are just two of the many forms of 

33
00:01:46,251 --> 00:01:47,060
dementia.

34
00:01:47,060 --> 00:01:47,893
It's becoming clearer and clearer that 
fueling our brains with the right foods 

35
00:01:51,411 --> 00:01:54,590
and avoiding the wrong ones are a key to
brain health.

36
00:01:55,190 --> 00:01:56,023
So much of what we talk about on this 
show is related to clear and critical 

37
00:01:58,851 --> 00:01:59,684
thinking.
While we may not think about how the 

38
00:02:01,461 --> 00:02:04,370
food that we eat is affecting our brains
on a daily basis,

39
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:07,700
feeding our brains the right foods is as
important,

40
00:02:07,701 --> 00:02:08,534
actually possibly more important than 
feeding our brains the right 

41
00:02:11,391 --> 00:02:12,224
information.
So this week we're going to learn some 

42
00:02:13,941 --> 00:02:18,941
information on what we should feed our 
brains so that we're optimized to engage

43
00:02:19,220 --> 00:02:21,890
in intellectual battles in the best way 
possible.

44
00:02:22,130 --> 00:02:25,490
Joining me to discuss this is an old 
friend of the show and author of the new

45
00:02:25,491 --> 00:02:29,030
book Genius Foods Max Lewkowicz.
Now,

46
00:02:29,031 --> 00:02:29,864
excuse me,
while I put grass fed butter on an 

47
00:02:31,371 --> 00:02:33,650
avocado,
sprinkled with Goji Berries.

48
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:43,880
Joining me today is a truth seeker,
a self experimenter of brain food expert

49
00:02:43,981 --> 00:02:47,310
and author of the upcoming book Genius 
Foods.

50
00:02:47,610 --> 00:02:49,710
Max Ligonier,
welcome back.

51
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:51,780
Thanks so much for having to the Rubin 
report.

52
00:02:51,781 --> 00:02:52,614
This is a back,
although most of my audience now will 

53
00:02:55,051 --> 00:02:59,860
not know you from the Rubin report,
but you used to do the old rubin report.

54
00:03:00,260 --> 00:03:02,380
It seems like a real lifetime ago,
doesn't it?

55
00:03:03,390 --> 00:03:05,290
Back back in the day when it was a panel
show,

56
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:09,160
it was a panel show years ago on t y,
t I don't even know what we're doing.

57
00:03:09,161 --> 00:03:11,950
I have almost no recollection of my life
at that time.

58
00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:12,880
It's,
you know,

59
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:14,850
the,
every time that I was on it though,

60
00:03:14,851 --> 00:03:15,684
I would always have such a good time and
I always would think to myself like how 

61
00:03:19,531 --> 00:03:20,364
good you are at what you do and so I'm 
just so honored to be here in this new 

62
00:03:23,371 --> 00:03:25,230
set and to see your success.
Like,

63
00:03:25,860 --> 00:03:27,360
you know,
the fact that you've just blown up.

64
00:03:27,361 --> 00:03:27,940
It's awesome.

65
00:03:27,940 --> 00:03:28,773
Cool.
Well thank you and I feel the same and 

66
00:03:30,011 --> 00:03:33,560
I'm glad that our paths have sort of a,
you know,

67
00:03:33,561 --> 00:03:36,010
I've been on parallel tracks kind of 
growing together.

68
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:39,400
You have a new book coming out,
which we're going to talk about shortly.

69
00:03:39,401 --> 00:03:41,910
The last time I saw you though,
uh,

70
00:03:42,020 --> 00:03:44,950
was about two or two and a half years 
ago.

71
00:03:45,340 --> 00:03:49,630
You had me eat some really nasty stuff 
on camera that you felt.

72
00:03:49,690 --> 00:03:51,970
I don't even know why you had me eat it,
but you wanted me to.

73
00:03:52,020 --> 00:03:52,960
What?
What did we eat?

74
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:55,640
Because you're doing a lot about food,
so you're,

75
00:03:55,641 --> 00:03:57,240
you're testing this stuff out.
All the time.

76
00:03:57,750 --> 00:03:59,240
We ate,
we ate Natto,

77
00:03:59,470 --> 00:04:00,290
which

78
00:04:00,290 --> 00:04:01,123
is a fermented soybean dish that is very
commonly consumed in Japan and that was 

79
00:04:04,461 --> 00:04:07,400
my first time ever trying it because I 
think,

80
00:04:07,401 --> 00:04:09,980
yeah,
back where your old set was,

81
00:04:09,981 --> 00:04:13,700
we were like a few blocks away from like
a Japanese market and I was like,

82
00:04:13,701 --> 00:04:15,620
wow,
what a great place to go and try to find

83
00:04:15,621 --> 00:04:16,454
this food that I've heard so much about 
because of its purported health 

84
00:04:18,501 --> 00:04:20,750
benefits,
but I never tasted it and it's known for

85
00:04:20,751 --> 00:04:23,420
being particularly gnarly.
Like it smells like dirty socks.

86
00:04:24,050 --> 00:04:26,810
And I knew that you were back at the 
studio and I was like,

87
00:04:26,811 --> 00:04:27,760
what?
You know,

88
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:28,633
there's no better time to try this 
gnarly food than with my friend Dave 

89
00:04:30,830 --> 00:04:32,990
Ruben.
So I brought it back and we tried it.

90
00:04:33,020 --> 00:04:34,820
And uh,
yeah,

91
00:04:34,821 --> 00:04:35,810
I don't think you were that night

92
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:37,430
two,
it was pretty nasty.

93
00:04:37,610 --> 00:04:38,443
Mean I'm,
I'm a pretty good eater and we're going 

94
00:04:40,241 --> 00:04:43,140
to get a lot into the different types of
things that you should be eating.

95
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:45,070
Fermented food,
obviously good,

96
00:04:45,310 --> 00:04:46,143
but it was kinda like beans in this 
gooey sticky sauce and it stunk to high 

97
00:04:50,951 --> 00:04:53,620
hell you're saying it was good for my 
brain.

98
00:04:53,650 --> 00:04:55,120
It's very good.
It's very good.

99
00:04:55,121 --> 00:04:55,840
Yeah.
There's,

100
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:56,591
I mean,
you know,

101
00:04:56,591 --> 00:04:58,870
it's the top known source of vitamin K 
two,

102
00:04:59,290 --> 00:05:00,123
which is a really important vitamin for 
a vitamin for maintaining calcium 

103
00:05:02,950 --> 00:05:03,783
homeostasis in the body.
Basically keeping calcium and the parts 

104
00:05:05,651 --> 00:05:06,484
of your body where calcium should be 
like your bones and your teeth and out 

105
00:05:09,131 --> 00:05:12,010
of your soft tissues like your kidneys 
and your arteries and stuff like that.

106
00:05:12,420 --> 00:05:14,500
Um,
there's really good research on vitaminK

107
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:16,720
two and yeah,
I just,

108
00:05:16,721 --> 00:05:18,040
you know,
natural is one of these foods.

109
00:05:18,041 --> 00:05:20,260
They eat it in one of the world's blue 
zones.

110
00:05:20,590 --> 00:05:21,423
So I just figured why not give it a try?
I would say it has the consistency of 

111
00:05:24,911 --> 00:05:27,370
like baked beans with a little bit of 
like personal

112
00:05:27,650 --> 00:05:31,340
can swirled together,
which is obviously not appealing.

113
00:05:31,341 --> 00:05:32,174
It's quite horrific.
I should've had something here for you 

114
00:05:34,311 --> 00:05:36,200
to taste on.
Camera don't have been awesome.

115
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:39,530
Like kicking the ball back.
Maybe.

116
00:05:39,620 --> 00:05:41,240
Maybe next time.
So first I thought,

117
00:05:41,241 --> 00:05:42,074
well we start off with before we get to 
the book is I think sort of what you're 

118
00:05:44,871 --> 00:05:45,704
doing is interesting because it kind of 
parallels what I'm doing here where 

119
00:05:48,530 --> 00:05:49,363
we're watching mainstream media crumble 
and people are coming to people like me 

120
00:05:52,881 --> 00:05:53,714
perhaps in and Shapiro and Joe Rogan and
all these alternate to hear about news 

121
00:05:58,700 --> 00:06:02,780
and I also think that's happening in the
food world and the Diet world as well,

122
00:06:02,781 --> 00:06:03,614
where you used to maybe watch the 
nightly news to find out what you're 

123
00:06:06,771 --> 00:06:08,690
supposed to eat,
what the latest fad is,

124
00:06:08,691 --> 00:06:10,280
what oils you're not supposed to have,
et Cetera,

125
00:06:10,281 --> 00:06:11,114
et Cetera.
And now people are going to people like 

126
00:06:12,980 --> 00:06:14,480
Joe Rogan,
who I just mentioned,

127
00:06:14,630 --> 00:06:16,580
Tim Ferriss,
people like you.

128
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:18,043
Did you sort of see that thing coming 
and that's why you started getting into 

129
00:06:20,991 --> 00:06:21,824
this world and we'll talk a little bit 
about your personal reasons why you got 

130
00:06:24,411 --> 00:06:25,244
into it.
Just a sec.

131
00:06:25,290 --> 00:06:26,123
Yeah.
No,

132
00:06:26,450 --> 00:06:28,560
it's an amazing point.
I feel that,

133
00:06:28,620 --> 00:06:29,610
you know,
look,

134
00:06:29,611 --> 00:06:31,590
we live in a time,
you know,

135
00:06:31,591 --> 00:06:34,710
and in a world where we have all of the 
world's information at our fingertips at

136
00:06:34,711 --> 00:06:36,960
any given time with our smart phones,
you know,

137
00:06:36,961 --> 00:06:40,620
and research is out there,
information wants to be free so,

138
00:06:40,740 --> 00:06:41,573
you know,
whereas prior generations I feel like 

139
00:06:43,380 --> 00:06:44,213
know could have,
could have only received health 

140
00:06:45,391 --> 00:06:49,050
information from the doctor or nutrition
information from the nutritionist.

141
00:06:49,420 --> 00:06:50,280
Um,
today,

142
00:06:50,281 --> 00:06:51,114
you know,
I think things are different where 

143
00:06:52,410 --> 00:06:54,760
people that are passionate and that,
uh,

144
00:06:54,870 --> 00:06:58,030
do their homework in a way.
I'm not just talking about going to know

145
00:06:58,150 --> 00:07:00,900
media for their health information,
but you know,

146
00:07:00,901 --> 00:07:03,030
pub med is something that anybody can 
search.

147
00:07:03,060 --> 00:07:03,470
It's,
you know,

148
00:07:03,470 --> 00:07:05,790
the research is out there.
Not Everybody's going to be qualified to

149
00:07:05,791 --> 00:07:07,220
the degree that they can,
you know,

150
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:08,700
understand,
for example,

151
00:07:08,701 --> 00:07:11,010
medical literature or even cut through 
the jargon.

152
00:07:11,010 --> 00:07:11,821
But,
um,

153
00:07:11,821 --> 00:07:15,480
there's a lot that people can glean from
what is readily available.

154
00:07:15,481 --> 00:07:16,314
I mean,
one of the ways that I try to tell 

155
00:07:18,241 --> 00:07:19,074
people to become educated about health 
and science and research is to look at 

156
00:07:22,381 --> 00:07:23,214
websites that put out university press 
releases that often accompany studies 

157
00:07:26,701 --> 00:07:28,320
like science daily.
For example,

158
00:07:28,321 --> 00:07:29,580
our medical express.
You know,

159
00:07:29,581 --> 00:07:30,414
oftentimes when a study's released,
the university will write a press 

160
00:07:33,661 --> 00:07:34,494
release that basically has the gist of 
what the study basically found in 

161
00:07:38,371 --> 00:07:42,230
layman's terms and that's often what 
journalists will use to write pieces for

162
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:43,253
the Huffington post or fast company.
So what I tell people to do is cut out 

163
00:07:46,261 --> 00:07:48,180
the middle man,
go to the press releases,

164
00:07:48,330 --> 00:07:50,910
read them,
then go to the research article,

165
00:07:51,030 --> 00:07:51,863
compare what you read in Layman's terms 
in the press release to the research 

166
00:07:53,851 --> 00:07:56,130
article and that can actually help you 
interpret research.

167
00:07:56,270 --> 00:07:58,520
So the average person,
they'll obviously,

168
00:07:58,521 --> 00:07:59,354
it's not going to do all that legwork 
and I think that's where someone like 

169
00:08:01,791 --> 00:08:02,624
you comes in going,
I will sit down and read all this stuff 

170
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:07,940
and now distill it to you in a way that 
makes it.

171
00:08:08,620 --> 00:08:09,161
Yeah.
Well,

172
00:08:09,161 --> 00:08:10,000
my background,
I mean,

173
00:08:10,001 --> 00:08:11,110
you know,
before,

174
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:15,730
before really diving into a health and 
nutrition and fitness,

175
00:08:15,731 --> 00:08:19,180
I was a journalist at current TV,
which was my first job out of college.

176
00:08:19,540 --> 00:08:22,390
And so getting to work with the 
journalists there,

177
00:08:22,660 --> 00:08:23,170
um,
you know,

178
00:08:23,170 --> 00:08:26,680
peabody award winning journalists,
award winning storytellers.

179
00:08:27,130 --> 00:08:27,963
Um,
it gave me a sense of how to ask 

180
00:08:30,521 --> 00:08:32,200
questions,
how to pick my sources,

181
00:08:32,201 --> 00:08:35,320
and then when I became interested in 
nutrition and health,

182
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:36,760
um,
you know,

183
00:08:36,761 --> 00:08:41,530
I kind of knew not only where to look 
but how to look and um,

184
00:08:42,070 --> 00:08:42,731
and yeah,
and you know,

185
00:08:42,731 --> 00:08:45,340
my unique job gave me the time and the 
ability and you know,

186
00:08:45,341 --> 00:08:49,540
my personal circumstances.
And so yeah,

187
00:08:49,541 --> 00:08:51,100
I don't expect everybody to do their own
research,

188
00:08:51,101 --> 00:08:52,900
but I do think that people should do 
their own research.

189
00:08:52,901 --> 00:08:54,280
I do think that the,
that the,

190
00:08:54,570 --> 00:08:55,403
you know,
healthcare healthcare is something that 

191
00:08:56,911 --> 00:08:57,744
we like to pretend that we're able to 
sort of offload to our healthcare 

192
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:01,470
providers.
Right?

193
00:09:01,740 --> 00:09:04,380
But you don't go to a doctor to be 
healthy.

194
00:09:04,381 --> 00:09:08,010
You go to a doctor to become free of 
disease or to have a disease treated.

195
00:09:08,540 --> 00:09:10,380
I think healthcare really is something 
that,

196
00:09:10,710 --> 00:09:12,030
um,
you know,

197
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:15,250
starts in the kitchen and in the gym and
it's something that we,

198
00:09:15,251 --> 00:09:18,270
you know,
that we have to imbue our lives with day

199
00:09:18,271 --> 00:09:18,700
to day.

200
00:09:18,700 --> 00:09:20,500
Yeah.
And I want it to start with that because

201
00:09:20,501 --> 00:09:21,334
I think it sets the table properly 
because I know on youtube there's a 

202
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:25,113
million people talking about health and 
diets and all that stuff and I want 

203
00:09:27,401 --> 00:09:28,234
people to understand that you're 
somebody that I know has been in this 

204
00:09:30,341 --> 00:09:32,980
for a long time actually doing the 
research.

205
00:09:33,190 --> 00:09:36,100
So let's go to that,
that personal circumstance part that you

206
00:09:36,101 --> 00:09:38,020
mentioned,
you sort of got into this,

207
00:09:38,420 --> 00:09:39,253
uh,
it's probably only about five years ago 

208
00:09:42,250 --> 00:09:43,870
with the circumstances with your mom at 
all.

209
00:09:44,150 --> 00:09:45,360
Can you take it from there?
Yeah.

210
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:46,233
So when I left current TV to sort of 
figure out where I was going to go with 

211
00:09:48,291 --> 00:09:49,580
my career,
um,

212
00:09:49,700 --> 00:09:52,650
it was sort of in that downtime in 
between jobs that um,

213
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:57,320
my mom started displaying very strange 
symptoms that I couldn't explain.

214
00:09:57,380 --> 00:09:59,960
I mean memory,
no problems with her memory.

215
00:09:59,961 --> 00:10:00,794
She complained of brain fog and she also
had changes to her gate that were very 

216
00:10:04,191 --> 00:10:04,701
apparent.
I mean,

217
00:10:04,701 --> 00:10:07,760
my mom is a spirited New Yorker.
New Yorkers walk very fast.

218
00:10:07,761 --> 00:10:09,420
They walk everywhere.
Um,

219
00:10:09,430 --> 00:10:10,263
and my mom ran a business so cognitively
she was always very sharp and 

220
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:14,833
essentially what we,
what we saw is that my mom's cognition 

221
00:10:17,690 --> 00:10:21,710
took like a,
it just seemed to have like,

222
00:10:22,370 --> 00:10:23,203
you know,
like a web browser with too many open 

223
00:10:24,081 --> 00:10:25,750
tabs is how I describe it,
you know,

224
00:10:25,751 --> 00:10:26,350
it just,
you know,

225
00:10:26,350 --> 00:10:27,183
like a stuttering frame rate on a 
youtube video with a poor Internet 

226
00:10:29,241 --> 00:10:30,074
connection.

227
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:33,350
And my mom's gate changed where,
you know,

228
00:10:33,351 --> 00:10:34,184
before she was a very fast walker,
she almost developed sort of like a 

229
00:10:37,011 --> 00:10:37,844
shuffle.
And both of these strange symptoms 

230
00:10:39,141 --> 00:10:43,400
seemed to come on at once.
And I had no prior family history of any

231
00:10:43,820 --> 00:10:47,870
neurodegenerative disease.
Dementia to me was not a term that I was

232
00:10:47,871 --> 00:10:48,704
familiar with.
I didn't know what else hammers disease 

233
00:10:49,851 --> 00:10:53,300
was actually when I thought about the 
word dementia,

234
00:10:53,890 --> 00:10:56,360
the one I thought about the character 
from the addams family movie,

235
00:10:56,390 --> 00:10:57,223
you know,
like it was like cousin it's or festers 

236
00:10:59,810 --> 00:11:02,180
like crush or something.
Her name was dementia,

237
00:11:02,181 --> 00:11:03,800
which was actually pretty funny.
But yeah,

238
00:11:04,910 --> 00:11:09,910
so coinciding with like my ignorance a,
I had the time to go with my mom to some

239
00:11:11,091 --> 00:11:13,160
of the top neurology departments in the 
country.

240
00:11:13,490 --> 00:11:15,200
We're very fortunate to be able to do 
that.

241
00:11:15,201 --> 00:11:19,040
We went to Nyu,
Columbia in New York,

242
00:11:19,041 --> 00:11:21,200
Johns Hopkins in Baltimore,
the Cleveland Clinic.

243
00:11:21,590 --> 00:11:24,680
I'm all in hopes of trying to find some 
kind of diagnosis for my mom,

244
00:11:24,700 --> 00:11:25,533
see what was going on.
And it was in 2011 at the Cleveland 

245
00:11:30,110 --> 00:11:31,130
Clinic,
um,

246
00:11:31,670 --> 00:11:32,503
where my mom was diagnosed with a 
neurodegenerative disease for the first 

247
00:11:34,611 --> 00:11:39,230
time and she was prescribed drugs for 
both Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's

248
00:11:39,231 --> 00:11:41,360
disease.
And at that moment,

249
00:11:41,390 --> 00:11:43,880
I mean my world pretty much stopped.
Like I,

250
00:11:44,890 --> 00:11:47,990
it was.
I'm a pretty chill guy that that weekend

251
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:49,753
or that week in Cleveland,
it was the first time in my that I'd 

252
00:11:53,411 --> 00:11:54,244
ever had a panic attack.
I was just so freaked out by the 

253
00:11:57,311 --> 00:11:58,144
possibility that my mom had this fatal 
disease for which there is no cure or 

254
00:12:02,201 --> 00:12:03,034
particularly meaningful treatment.
And I basically became unable to think 

255
00:12:07,271 --> 00:12:08,710
about anything else,
let alone my career.

256
00:12:08,711 --> 00:12:10,300
I ended up,
you know,

257
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:14,320
my mom started taking the drugs.
I ended up coming back to La to try to,

258
00:12:14,470 --> 00:12:17,080
you know,
look for jobs and do what it is that you

259
00:12:17,081 --> 00:12:19,840
do when you live in La and you're a 
journalist on TV.

260
00:12:20,710 --> 00:12:25,090
And I basically became unable to think 
about anything other than nutrition,

261
00:12:25,110 --> 00:12:27,580
you know,
every waking minute that I wasn't,

262
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:29,230
you know,
doing something career related.

263
00:12:29,231 --> 00:12:30,064
I was in pub Med digging through the 
research and what I think really 

264
00:12:36,041 --> 00:12:36,874
motivated this journey for me was the 
fact that what I uncovered in the 

265
00:12:39,851 --> 00:12:44,200
research was a stark contrast to the,
you know,

266
00:12:44,210 --> 00:12:48,010
what neuroscientists Norman doidge calls
neurological nihilism to the,

267
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:48,873
to the despair and bleakness that I 
experienced in those doctor's offices 

268
00:12:51,791 --> 00:12:53,040
with my mom.
Can you,

269
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:56,110
can you describe what that is?
What are they actually telling you?

270
00:12:56,150 --> 00:12:57,970
Well,
yeah,

271
00:12:57,971 --> 00:13:00,110
so I,
I call it diagnose and adios.

272
00:13:00,340 --> 00:13:02,310
Basically there's a,
there's a,

273
00:13:02,380 --> 00:13:03,213
there's a quote that I learned that is 
circulated amongst medical school 

274
00:13:06,370 --> 00:13:09,640
medical school students that 
neurologists don't treat disease.

275
00:13:09,641 --> 00:13:10,474
They admire it.
That's because the brain is a mystery 

276
00:13:12,490 --> 00:13:13,150
for the most part.

277
00:13:13,150 --> 00:13:15,370
I mean we know quite a bit about the 
brain,

278
00:13:15,371 --> 00:13:16,204
which is surprising,
but there's a lot more unknowns than 

279
00:13:17,261 --> 00:13:21,040
knowns at this point,
and treatments for neurological diseases

280
00:13:21,041 --> 00:13:22,690
are very limited.
You know,

281
00:13:23,220 --> 00:13:24,053
there's no approved drug for Alzheimer's
disease that has a disease modifying 

282
00:13:28,901 --> 00:13:31,590
treatment.
They only act as bandaids,

283
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:32,620
like chemical,
bandaids,

284
00:13:32,621 --> 00:13:33,454
essentially that work to sort of 
artificially boost neurotransmitters in 

285
00:13:36,521 --> 00:13:37,354
the brain,
but they do nothing to solve the 

286
00:13:38,021 --> 00:13:41,670
underlying pathology.
And you know,

287
00:13:41,740 --> 00:13:44,140
drug trials are notoriously bad.
Pfizer just announced,

288
00:13:44,141 --> 00:13:44,974
for example,
that they're going to stop pursuing a 

289
00:13:47,290 --> 00:13:52,090
pharmaceutical treatments for 
Alzheimer's disease because treating the

290
00:13:52,091 --> 00:13:56,750
quest to find a drug to treat the 
disease has like a 99 point six,

291
00:13:56,751 --> 00:14:00,190
two percent fail rate that's worse than 
any other disease.

292
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:02,760
So meaning that they are getting out of 
the game altogether,

293
00:14:02,770 --> 00:14:06,220
they view this as something that can't 
be solved via drugs.

294
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:07,330
I mean,
that sounds incredible.

295
00:14:07,331 --> 00:14:09,250
I don't know how often that happens with
other diseases.

296
00:14:09,251 --> 00:14:11,050
That sounds.
That sounds pretty staggering.

297
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:11,913
Yeah.
I mean another huge pharmaceutical 

298
00:14:12,731 --> 00:14:15,610
company basically recently announced 
this.

299
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:17,560
The same thing.
X event.

300
00:14:17,950 --> 00:14:19,900
Um,
yeah.

301
00:14:19,901 --> 00:14:20,860
It's a massive fell.
Right?

302
00:14:20,861 --> 00:14:21,694
So think about it from the perspective 
perspective of an investor or are you 

303
00:14:24,671 --> 00:14:27,790
going to invest in an Alzheimer's or in 
any drug trial that has,

304
00:14:28,070 --> 00:14:30,940
you know,
a 99 point six percent fail rate.

305
00:14:30,941 --> 00:14:31,774
It's,
you know,

306
00:14:32,140 --> 00:14:32,973
it's just not a smart investment.
And that's why Alzheimer's disease 

307
00:14:35,441 --> 00:14:36,274
research is criminally underfunded or I 
shouldn't say criminally if it makes 

308
00:14:39,580 --> 00:14:42,140
sense,
although it's tragic because you know,

309
00:14:42,141 --> 00:14:42,974
if,
if there was a pill tomorrow that I 

310
00:14:44,171 --> 00:14:46,720
could give my mom that would help in a 
meaningful way.

311
00:14:47,050 --> 00:14:47,883
Of course I would want it.
I want it for all the 5 million people 

312
00:14:51,291 --> 00:14:53,210
in America that are suffering from 
Alzheimer's disease,

313
00:14:53,820 --> 00:14:55,890
you know,
because I can bring almost anything back

314
00:14:55,891 --> 00:14:56,724
to politics.
It's like this is a good argument for 

315
00:14:59,071 --> 00:15:03,180
publicly funded scientific research 
because it doesn't have to deal with the

316
00:15:03,181 --> 00:15:05,100
bottom line where you're saying,
yeah,

317
00:15:05,101 --> 00:15:07,230
these companies,
they have to deal with a bottom line and

318
00:15:07,231 --> 00:15:11,070
shareholders and they have to then stop 
at some point if,

319
00:15:11,340 --> 00:15:14,790
if they can't get far enough where 
something publicly funded,

320
00:15:14,791 --> 00:15:16,680
they can keep going to the science 
hopefully.

321
00:15:16,830 --> 00:15:17,663
Although you found that there are some 
other ways to deal with this and that's 

322
00:15:20,430 --> 00:15:21,510
really what changed your life.

323
00:15:21,630 --> 00:15:22,381
Yeah.
So I,

324
00:15:22,381 --> 00:15:23,214
you know,
I saw on the one hand I became really 

325
00:15:24,961 --> 00:15:26,600
interested in learning about,
you know,

326
00:15:26,730 --> 00:15:27,563
potential diet and lifestyle 
interventions that I could throw my 

327
00:15:30,721 --> 00:15:31,554
mom's way to sort of help her.
But then at the same time I became 

328
00:15:33,841 --> 00:15:34,674
really conscious of my own brain health 
because I learned that changes begin in 

329
00:15:37,291 --> 00:15:41,130
the brain decades before the first 
symptom of Alzheimer's disease,

330
00:15:41,131 --> 00:15:44,370
which is just one form of dementia.
But even Parkinson's disease,

331
00:15:44,580 --> 00:15:47,580
by the time you show your first symptom 
of Parkinson's disease,

332
00:15:47,700 --> 00:15:50,340
half of the neurons involved in 
movement,

333
00:15:50,770 --> 00:15:51,603
uh,
in that part in the part of the brain 

334
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:55,140
associated with Parkinson's disease are 
already dead.

335
00:15:55,410 --> 00:15:56,360
So these are not,
you know,

336
00:15:56,370 --> 00:15:57,203
like any chronic disease,
these are not diseases that develop 

337
00:15:59,701 --> 00:16:01,770
overnight.
They take years,

338
00:16:01,771 --> 00:16:02,604
if not decades to develop.
And I became really interested in doing 

339
00:16:04,981 --> 00:16:08,520
what I could do in my own life to 
maximize my brain health so that I might

340
00:16:08,580 --> 00:16:11,010
not have to deal with what it is at my 
mom dealing with

341
00:16:11,140 --> 00:16:12,190
out.
We'll go from there.

342
00:16:12,460 --> 00:16:15,550
We'll slightly shift to your book.
Obviously this is all intertwined.

343
00:16:16,140 --> 00:16:16,973
The,
this is the advanced copy of the book 

344
00:16:17,921 --> 00:16:18,754
comes out in a couple of weeks and I was
reading a little bit and I just thought 

345
00:16:20,861 --> 00:16:23,860
that the opening alone was really 
perfect.

346
00:16:23,861 --> 00:16:26,080
So I'm just going to read the opening 
paragraph,

347
00:16:26,260 --> 00:16:27,910
unless do you want to read it in your 
own voice?

348
00:16:27,911 --> 00:16:28,744
Maybe.
Maybe you should.

349
00:16:28,750 --> 00:16:29,583
You know what?
I'm going to let you read the opening 

350
00:16:31,061 --> 00:16:33,160
paragraph of your book.
Oh Man,

351
00:16:33,161 --> 00:16:34,360
I thought it was pretty beautiful.

352
00:16:34,700 --> 00:16:35,533
Thank you so much.
I'm nestled within your skull mere 

353
00:16:39,231 --> 00:16:40,064
inches from your eyes are $86,
million of the most efficient 

354
00:16:42,680 --> 00:16:43,513
transistors in the known universe.
This neural network is you running the 

355
00:16:46,671 --> 00:16:47,504
operating system.
We know his life and no computer yet 

356
00:16:49,581 --> 00:16:50,414
conceived,
comes close to it's awesome 

357
00:16:51,381 --> 00:16:52,214
capabilities,
forged over millions and millions of 

358
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:56,233
years of life on earth.
Your brain is capable of storing nearly 

359
00:16:58,430 --> 00:17:00,740
8,000
iphones worth of information.

360
00:17:01,340 --> 00:17:02,173
Everything you are do love,
feel care for long for and aspire to is 

361
00:17:07,131 --> 00:17:07,964
enabled by an incredibly complex 
invisible symphony of neurological 

362
00:17:11,001 --> 00:17:12,800
processes,
elegant,

363
00:17:12,801 --> 00:17:14,600
seamless,
and blisteringly fast.

364
00:17:14,601 --> 00:17:19,601
When scientists try to simulate just one
second of a human brains abilities,

365
00:17:20,030 --> 00:17:22,310
it took supercomputers 40 minutes to do 
so.

366
00:17:23,390 --> 00:17:26,000
So yeah,
I mean the brain is who we each are heir

367
00:17:26,001 --> 00:17:30,950
to this amazing birthright,
forged over millions of millions,

368
00:17:30,950 --> 00:17:32,150
millions and millions of years of life 
on earth.

369
00:17:33,740 --> 00:17:36,080
And yet the modern world is fighting it 
at every turn.

370
00:17:36,081 --> 00:17:36,914
You know from the toxic industrial 
products that have saturated the food 

371
00:17:40,491 --> 00:17:44,930
supply to the dietary advice that we've 
been given for decades to now.

372
00:17:44,931 --> 00:17:47,900
The fact that the pendulum is swinging 
the other direction and people are,

373
00:17:48,170 --> 00:17:49,830
it's sort of like a dietary free for 
all,

374
00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:50,900
you know,
so.

375
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:53,340
All right.
Let's shift my dietary.

376
00:17:53,770 --> 00:17:54,603
I want to talk about your.
So you know that at the moment I'm in 

377
00:17:57,631 --> 00:17:59,850
the middle of this sort of slow carb

378
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:02,310
diet is high fat,
no sugar,

379
00:18:02,311 --> 00:18:05,760
no carb diet.
I've actually in about a,

380
00:18:05,761 --> 00:18:09,540
as of this taping in about nine days,
I've lost about three pounds.

381
00:18:09,570 --> 00:18:11,130
Pretty good.
I actually feel pretty good.

382
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:13,830
I have these brief moments where I want 
to punch random people.

383
00:18:14,130 --> 00:18:17,250
I think I'm being a little meaner on 
twitter that I go would be for real.

384
00:18:17,251 --> 00:18:19,380
I mean like there's just like a little 
bit of mood stuff,

385
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:20,333
but my energy feels pretty good.
I'm not getting that sort of crashed 

386
00:18:23,221 --> 00:18:25,590
from coffee that you might get at like 
2:00.

387
00:18:25,591 --> 00:18:29,130
That then has people drinking all kinds 
of chemicals that after there 2:30

388
00:18:29,131 --> 00:18:32,760
feeling or whatever that is.
So I basically feel pretty good.

389
00:18:32,761 --> 00:18:37,620
It's pretty much just meat and fish and 
veggies and a lot of butter.

390
00:18:37,890 --> 00:18:38,723
And you said,
you said to me right before we started 

391
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:42,390
maybe maybe the butter grass fed butter.

392
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:43,241
Yeah,
well,

393
00:18:43,241 --> 00:18:46,150
grass fed butter is definitely good.
You know,

394
00:18:46,151 --> 00:18:46,984
I mean,
there's definitely trace nutrients in 

395
00:18:48,521 --> 00:18:49,600
it.
Vitamin K two,

396
00:18:49,601 --> 00:18:51,460
which we talked about earlier,
Cla,

397
00:18:51,461 --> 00:18:55,000
which is being studied as a potential 
cancer fighter and fat burner.

398
00:18:55,250 --> 00:18:56,830
Um,
but it's uh,

399
00:18:56,831 --> 00:18:57,664
you know,
one of the hallmarks of a healthy food 

400
00:18:58,901 --> 00:18:59,734
is nutrient density.
When you take any concentrated fat 

401
00:19:02,770 --> 00:19:04,180
butter,
oil,

402
00:19:04,181 --> 00:19:06,280
they're not very nutrient dense.
They've got a lot of calories,

403
00:19:06,281 --> 00:19:10,120
nine calories per gram,
a tablespoon of oil has a hundred and 40

404
00:19:10,121 --> 00:19:12,220
calories.
And um,

405
00:19:13,300 --> 00:19:14,380
and uh,
yeah,

406
00:19:14,381 --> 00:19:15,214
and it's just,
it's a lot of calories with very little 

407
00:19:16,181 --> 00:19:17,160
nutrients.
And there's,

408
00:19:17,190 --> 00:19:18,430
you know,
on butter alone,

409
00:19:18,820 --> 00:19:19,653
there's not a lot of evidence to say 
that butter improves fat burning or 

410
00:19:23,741 --> 00:19:25,480
brain health or anything like that.
So,

411
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:27,250
you know,
I like to tell people that,

412
00:19:27,251 --> 00:19:28,450
you know,
consuming fat,

413
00:19:28,990 --> 00:19:30,670
the high fat,
low carb Diet,

414
00:19:30,671 --> 00:19:33,430
if you already have fat,
all you need is a low carb.

415
00:19:33,700 --> 00:19:35,260
You know,
your body has the fat to burn.

416
00:19:36,130 --> 00:19:36,980
So nobody's good.

417
00:19:37,230 --> 00:19:38,063
Go to your fat probably in your stomach 
area as opposed to what a lot of people 

418
00:19:42,331 --> 00:19:43,164
are doing with these diets is you're 
loading up on fat to sort of get the 

419
00:19:44,881 --> 00:19:48,400
bike going on fat and then the hope is 
that then it to your.

420
00:19:48,700 --> 00:19:49,533
Everybody's going to want to burn the 
fat that you're consuming before it 

421
00:19:51,081 --> 00:19:54,590
burns the fat that you have around your 
waist and the point of a diet like this,

422
00:19:54,591 --> 00:19:56,660
I would assume is to lose some of the 
fat around your,

423
00:19:56,930 --> 00:19:57,800
around your waist.
Yeah,

424
00:19:57,830 --> 00:19:58,663
I mean that's why I think this 
conversation is so interesting because 

425
00:20:01,040 --> 00:20:01,641
I,
you know,

426
00:20:01,641 --> 00:20:02,570
Ferris,
Tim Ferris,

427
00:20:02,571 --> 00:20:05,630
he's the one that sort of did this low 
carb thing first or the four hour body,

428
00:20:05,631 --> 00:20:07,460
whatever it is.
And it's like,

429
00:20:07,550 --> 00:20:08,410
well,
all right.

430
00:20:08,420 --> 00:20:10,520
He's focusing on that part,
the weight loss part.

431
00:20:10,521 --> 00:20:12,240
So I am seeing some results on that 
front.

432
00:20:12,590 --> 00:20:15,680
You're focusing on the brain part,
which is also very important to me.

433
00:20:15,681 --> 00:20:16,150
You know,
you know,

434
00:20:16,150 --> 00:20:16,983
I'm someone that likes to know what I'm 
talking about and be able to have clean 

435
00:20:19,221 --> 00:20:19,980
thoughts at all.

436
00:20:19,980 --> 00:20:20,813
Of course I liked,
I mean I like to focus on the weight 

437
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:23,233
part too.
I mean that's a concern for I think 

438
00:20:24,410 --> 00:20:25,243
everybody and it's a good way also to 
just have this conversation about 

439
00:20:27,921 --> 00:20:30,060
nutrition and healthy eating.
Um,

440
00:20:30,140 --> 00:20:31,370
you know,
when you start a low carb diet,

441
00:20:31,371 --> 00:20:32,204
you're going to lose a lot of water 
weight at first because what you're 

442
00:20:33,651 --> 00:20:37,160
doing is you're depleting the amount of 
glycogen stored in your muscles.

443
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:40,070
Glycogen is basically how your muscles 
and liver stores sugar,

444
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:42,770
but for every gram of glycogen in your 
muscles store,

445
00:20:42,771 --> 00:20:45,050
you also store about three to four grams
of water.

446
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:46,153
So that's why once you start depleting 
the glycogen from your muscles with 

447
00:20:48,641 --> 00:20:51,040
vigorous exercise or just by not eating 
a lot of carbs,

448
00:20:51,820 --> 00:20:54,250
you lose a lot of water weight very 
quickly.

449
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:55,233
And that's also why when people stop 
eating low carb and go back to eating a 

450
00:20:58,061 --> 00:20:58,894
higher carb diet,
their weight just shoots up because 

451
00:21:00,551 --> 00:21:03,280
their muscles end up storing all that 
glycogen along with all that,

452
00:21:03,370 --> 00:21:04,203
you know,
with four parts water for every one 

453
00:21:05,381 --> 00:21:06,460
gram,
one part of,

454
00:21:06,700 --> 00:21:07,540
of sugar storage.

455
00:21:07,590 --> 00:21:09,930
I think what we're going to have to do 
is like in a month from now,

456
00:21:09,931 --> 00:21:10,764
if I can keep running with this thing,
I'll have to have you and Ferris on 

457
00:21:12,690 --> 00:21:14,430
together.
You guys can like poke me,

458
00:21:14,431 --> 00:21:16,710
you can poke my brain area.
He could poke my stomach,

459
00:21:16,711 --> 00:21:17,990
will figure out.
Sounds great.

460
00:21:17,991 --> 00:21:18,870
What happened here?
All right,

461
00:21:18,871 --> 00:21:21,660
so enough about my,
my diet people.

462
00:21:21,661 --> 00:21:24,060
I guess we'll see the results right here
on the youtube.

463
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:25,530
Um,
okay.

464
00:21:25,531 --> 00:21:27,710
So you start realizing that the,
the,

465
00:21:28,220 --> 00:21:31,770
the medicine for dementia or 
Alzheimer's,

466
00:21:31,771 --> 00:21:33,080
these cognitive,
uh,

467
00:21:33,150 --> 00:21:35,490
degenerative diseases is not quite 
there.

468
00:21:35,940 --> 00:21:38,720
You start changing your own diet,
but then also realized,

469
00:21:38,721 --> 00:21:41,910
well this is how I can also sort of 
helped my mom and help other people like

470
00:21:41,930 --> 00:21:42,763
it.
So what are some of the first things 

471
00:21:43,591 --> 00:21:44,424
that you realized that do,
that we as people have generally are 

472
00:21:46,561 --> 00:21:47,220
doing wrong?

473
00:21:47,220 --> 00:21:48,300
Yeah,
well definitely,

474
00:21:48,301 --> 00:21:51,640
you know,
my diet used to be dictated by um,

475
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:52,793
you know,
what sort of conventional wisdom was 

476
00:21:54,211 --> 00:21:57,030
surrounding a healthy diet.
So I used to build my base,

477
00:21:57,031 --> 00:22:00,870
my diet or on grains.
I used to basically Shaun White carbs,

478
00:22:00,871 --> 00:22:01,920
you know,
white rice,

479
00:22:01,921 --> 00:22:04,110
white bread as if it were some kind of 
toxin,

480
00:22:04,380 --> 00:22:07,020
but if you put a huge bowl of brown rice
in front of me,

481
00:22:07,021 --> 00:22:09,330
I would go to town on it often asking 
for seconds,

482
00:22:09,470 --> 00:22:10,303
you know,
every meal had to include a grain and I 

483
00:22:11,131 --> 00:22:11,964
would notice that my energy levels 
throughout the day always felt like a 

484
00:22:15,541 --> 00:22:16,410
rollercoaster,
you know,

485
00:22:16,411 --> 00:22:17,244
I couldn't really go many hours after 
waking without eating something right 

486
00:22:20,221 --> 00:22:21,054
away.
And in between lunch and dinner I was 

487
00:22:22,471 --> 00:22:24,270
off.
I would often find myself starving.

488
00:22:25,020 --> 00:22:26,160
And,
you know,

489
00:22:26,161 --> 00:22:27,600
when I started looking into the 
research,

490
00:22:27,601 --> 00:22:28,434
I realized that there's really no good 
evidence to say that grains improve 

491
00:22:31,201 --> 00:22:31,530
health.

492
00:22:31,530 --> 00:22:33,210
I mean certainly if you're metabolically
healthy,

493
00:22:33,211 --> 00:22:34,044
you can tolerate grains,
which is not the case for 50 percent of 

494
00:22:36,451 --> 00:22:40,200
the people living in America that are 
either pre diabetic or diabetic and have

495
00:22:40,201 --> 00:22:43,590
essentially become glucose or 
carbohydrate intolerant.

496
00:22:43,980 --> 00:22:45,180
If you're healthy though,
you can eat,

497
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:46,073
you know,
rice and you can certainly incorporated 

498
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:51,090
as a means of improving a athletic 
performance.

499
00:22:51,450 --> 00:22:53,850
Um,
but that was really the first thing that

500
00:22:53,851 --> 00:22:54,270
I did.
You know,

501
00:22:54,270 --> 00:22:56,520
because my dad was never very high in 
added sugars.

502
00:22:57,360 --> 00:22:58,193
I started cutting out the breads and 
rices and all that stuff and the pastas 

503
00:23:02,820 --> 00:23:04,830
and I noticed that my energy levels 
just,

504
00:23:05,330 --> 00:23:06,840
you know,
not only did they go through the roof,

505
00:23:06,841 --> 00:23:08,280
but there were more stable throughout 
the day.

506
00:23:08,750 --> 00:23:11,070
Um,
and you know,

507
00:23:11,071 --> 00:23:14,220
without even really trying my body 
composition changed.

508
00:23:14,221 --> 00:23:15,054
I started losing fat,
which is something that was just like a 

509
00:23:18,841 --> 00:23:19,680
side bonus.

510
00:23:20,020 --> 00:23:22,410
And again,
you know,

511
00:23:22,411 --> 00:23:23,244
the recommendations to eat grains 
because many people do consider them 

512
00:23:26,131 --> 00:23:26,641
healthy.
You know,

513
00:23:26,641 --> 00:23:28,890
how could keen wire brown rice peanuts 
but healthy,

514
00:23:29,330 --> 00:23:31,790
um,
come from misguided,

515
00:23:31,830 --> 00:23:32,663
you know,
nutrition policy over the past 50 years 

516
00:23:35,190 --> 00:23:38,400
that have really been attributed to the 
Mediterranean dietary pattern.

517
00:23:38,850 --> 00:23:39,683
That's this nebulous idea of how people 
in the Mediterranean eat 'em because 

518
00:23:44,610 --> 00:23:45,443
epidemiological observational population
based research shows that they have 

519
00:23:49,311 --> 00:23:52,850
reduced rates of cardiovascular disease 
and neurological disease.

520
00:23:52,851 --> 00:23:55,430
But when you look at randomized control 
trials,

521
00:23:55,431 --> 00:23:58,580
which are the kinds of trials required 
to prove cause and effect,

522
00:23:58,800 --> 00:24:01,850
there is no good evidence to say that 
grains improve health.

523
00:24:02,120 --> 00:24:02,953
In fact,
when you look at research controlled 

524
00:24:04,131 --> 00:24:09,131
trials with people with prediabetes or 
type two diabetes or obesity,

525
00:24:09,560 --> 00:24:10,393
low carb diets seem to win most of the 
time when compared to a standard low 

526
00:24:15,561 --> 00:24:16,550
fat,
you know,

527
00:24:16,551 --> 00:24:18,830
conventional wisdom,
conventional dietary wisdom.

528
00:24:18,940 --> 00:24:19,773
Yeah.
So let's back up for a second because 

529
00:24:21,041 --> 00:24:21,874
you said something really interesting 
that just sort of rolled off your 

530
00:24:23,471 --> 00:24:24,304
tongue.
It seems pretty freaking staggering and 

531
00:24:26,111 --> 00:24:26,944
scary.
Fifty percent of Americans are either 

532
00:24:28,991 --> 00:24:32,510
pre diabetic or diabetic.
That's what the latest statistics.

533
00:24:32,511 --> 00:24:34,720
So what is actually,
what is prediabetic actually mean?

534
00:24:34,820 --> 00:24:35,653
So when you're pre diabetic,
your blood sugar is higher than it 

535
00:24:38,031 --> 00:24:39,860
should be.
That's what a doctor will measure.

536
00:24:39,861 --> 00:24:41,360
And they'll say you should probably,
you know,

537
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:45,350
change up your diet because you are at 
risk for becoming a type two diabetic.

538
00:24:45,810 --> 00:24:46,643
Um,
it's sort of like this middle ground 

539
00:24:47,391 --> 00:24:48,700
where,
um,

540
00:24:49,650 --> 00:24:50,483
yeah,
your blood sugar is higher than it 

541
00:24:51,021 --> 00:24:51,390
should be.

542
00:24:51,390 --> 00:24:54,680
Do they know how much that number has 
changed over the years?

543
00:24:54,730 --> 00:24:58,120
I suspect since probably the fifties 
when we started all this process,

544
00:24:58,121 --> 00:25:00,810
food and sugars and all that stuff that,
that,

545
00:25:00,900 --> 00:25:01,733
and soft drinks and everything else,
that must have tremendously increased 

546
00:25:04,561 --> 00:25:05,220
that.

547
00:25:05,220 --> 00:25:06,031
Yeah,
I mean,

548
00:25:06,031 --> 00:25:08,820
it's,
it's skyrocketed in tandem with,

549
00:25:08,850 --> 00:25:10,890
you know,
the obesity rates in this country.

550
00:25:11,340 --> 00:25:12,173
Sixties,
two thirds of people are either 

551
00:25:13,261 --> 00:25:14,870
overweight or obese,
um,

552
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:18,780
and they've kind of risen in tandem with
one another.

553
00:25:19,130 --> 00:25:19,963
Uh,
and the only thing that can really 

554
00:25:21,241 --> 00:25:23,850
explain it is the environment,
you know,

555
00:25:23,851 --> 00:25:26,790
because our genes certainly haven't 
changed over the past 100 years as a,

556
00:25:26,850 --> 00:25:29,100
as a population.
So what has.

557
00:25:29,101 --> 00:25:30,060
Well,
the food supply,

558
00:25:30,620 --> 00:25:32,250
um,
and you know,

559
00:25:32,251 --> 00:25:34,440
there's a lot of zealotry in the world 
of nutrition.

560
00:25:34,441 --> 00:25:35,131
It's a very,
you know,

561
00:25:35,131 --> 00:25:37,440
people tend to feel very religious of 
other nutritious,

562
00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:39,090
uh,
beliefs.

563
00:25:39,390 --> 00:25:41,170
Um,
but you know,

564
00:25:41,190 --> 00:25:45,690
in general what I think most people 
would agree on is that there is become a

565
00:25:45,750 --> 00:25:50,430
ubiquity of hyper processed foods that 
are rich in both readily,

566
00:25:50,431 --> 00:25:53,850
easily digestible carbohydrates,
pulverized grains,

567
00:25:53,851 --> 00:25:57,240
stripped of their nutrients and added 
fats.

568
00:25:57,720 --> 00:26:01,890
And you know,
both of these foods put together a,

569
00:26:02,040 --> 00:26:04,770
basically create a stereotypical junk 
food.

570
00:26:05,310 --> 00:26:08,430
And that's really what most people are 
consuming these days.

571
00:26:08,431 --> 00:26:09,264
I mean 60 percent of calories that 
Americans consume come from these exact 

572
00:26:11,821 --> 00:26:13,710
kinds of foods,
ultra processed foods.

573
00:26:13,820 --> 00:26:14,653
I always think of that commercial.
I don't know if they're still running 

574
00:26:16,191 --> 00:26:17,024
it,
but it's with a Larry the cable guy for 

575
00:26:18,981 --> 00:26:19,814
prior Lasek OTC and you know,
he's out there eating the hot dogs and 

576
00:26:22,641 --> 00:26:25,440
all this stuff and he's basically like,
you can eat whatever you want as long as

577
00:26:25,690 --> 00:26:30,290
your private sec otc.
Like it's like the pill is the answer,

578
00:26:30,530 --> 00:26:31,363
you know,
he's a pretty heavy guy in the first 

579
00:26:32,271 --> 00:26:33,590
place.
I have no problem with him,

580
00:26:33,830 --> 00:26:34,663
but it's like that,
that we go to do whatever the hell you 

581
00:26:36,891 --> 00:26:39,710
want.
And then here's our magic pill for it.

582
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:42,500
Probably not.
The best way to be dealing with are not.

583
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:44,100
No,
not the best way at all.

584
00:26:44,100 --> 00:26:45,210
I mean,
and the thing is,

585
00:26:45,370 --> 00:26:46,500
you know,
once you've.

586
00:26:46,530 --> 00:26:51,530
One of the main drivers of of type two 
diabetes and insulin resistance,

587
00:26:52,441 --> 00:26:54,210
which category,
which is one of the sort of,

588
00:26:54,390 --> 00:26:56,460
which is the hallmark of type two 
diabetes,

589
00:26:57,420 --> 00:26:58,253
is chronically elevated levels of 
insulin which could precede a diagnosis 

590
00:27:01,171 --> 00:27:02,004
of prediabetes by a decade.
So I mean people are walking around 

591
00:27:05,611 --> 00:27:08,850
eating on average 300 grams of 
carbohydrates per day.

592
00:27:08,851 --> 00:27:10,680
Exactly from the kinds of foods that 
we're talking about,

593
00:27:10,681 --> 00:27:11,514
hyper processed foods and it's just 
doing a number on our metabolisms are 

594
00:27:14,521 --> 00:27:18,320
waistlines and genius foods we explore,
you know,

595
00:27:18,360 --> 00:27:21,270
what it's doing to our brains and our 
mental function and our moods.

596
00:27:21,350 --> 00:27:22,183
Yeah.
So that's really where I want to focus 

597
00:27:23,211 --> 00:27:24,044
on this because I think that's your 
expertise and I just find that 

598
00:27:25,850 --> 00:27:26,683
fascinating because I think there's a 
lot of things happening right now that 

599
00:27:28,731 --> 00:27:29,564
might be changing some of our brain 
chemistry and how we think and all that 

600
00:27:32,751 --> 00:27:33,584
sort of stuff.
So at any point when this was happening 

601
00:27:35,661 --> 00:27:36,494
with your mom,
did any doctor say maybe she should 

602
00:27:38,871 --> 00:27:40,400
change her diet,
this or that?

603
00:27:40,401 --> 00:27:41,220
Or really

604
00:27:41,220 --> 00:27:42,053
not.
Once,

605
00:27:42,650 --> 00:27:45,960
and again,
I've been to all of the most storied,

606
00:27:45,970 --> 00:27:46,803
you know,
US news and whatever that the annual 

607
00:27:50,280 --> 00:27:52,860
ranking of hospitals in America is that 
we were at,

608
00:27:53,010 --> 00:27:56,790
we went to the top hospitals to try to 
find a diagnosis and not once was,

609
00:27:57,150 --> 00:28:00,990
um,
diet mentioned at all and you know,

610
00:28:01,110 --> 00:28:01,943
there's,
there's not conclusive evidence on how 

611
00:28:04,290 --> 00:28:06,600
diet can affect somebody who has the 
disease,

612
00:28:06,601 --> 00:28:07,920
although it's starting to bubble up in 
the,

613
00:28:08,070 --> 00:28:09,790
in the literature.
Um,

614
00:28:09,810 --> 00:28:10,621
but yeah,
I mean,

615
00:28:10,621 --> 00:28:11,454
you know,
exercise wasn't really mentioned even 

616
00:28:12,961 --> 00:28:16,460
though exercise is one of the best ways 
to treat,

617
00:28:16,630 --> 00:28:17,820
you know,
one of the actually,

618
00:28:18,210 --> 00:28:19,770
um,
the,

619
00:28:19,771 --> 00:28:20,750
uh,
the,

620
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:21,833
the,
um,

621
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:24,750
the guidelines for treating mild 
cognitive impairment.

622
00:28:24,751 --> 00:28:26,790
We're literally just updated two weeks 
ago,

623
00:28:27,150 --> 00:28:28,140
uh,
to,

624
00:28:28,290 --> 00:28:29,123
you know,
to include exercise as a means of 

625
00:28:30,451 --> 00:28:32,310
treatment for people with mild cognitive
impairment,

626
00:28:32,311 --> 00:28:33,144
which is sort of like pre dementia which
often converts to diseases like 

627
00:28:36,361 --> 00:28:37,230
Alzheimer's disease.

628
00:28:37,950 --> 00:28:38,940
But yeah,
so I became,

629
00:28:39,090 --> 00:28:42,990
I became fixated on,
on these sort of alternate approaches to

630
00:28:43,020 --> 00:28:46,410
treatment and even possibly prevention.
Um,

631
00:28:47,250 --> 00:28:48,083
when I,
when I,

632
00:28:48,120 --> 00:28:48,953
when I had that experience with my mom,
because I've always been a big believer 

633
00:28:50,821 --> 00:28:51,654
in the power of Diet and lifestyle,
I've just seen it play out in my own 

634
00:28:53,611 --> 00:28:54,444
life.
I mean I go to the gym and I'm a 

635
00:28:55,621 --> 00:28:59,240
different person walking out of the gym 
and I am walking into the gym.

636
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:02,880
I mean whatever cobwebs I have in my 
head are gone,

637
00:29:03,150 --> 00:29:05,040
you know,
excised like the demons,

638
00:29:05,130 --> 00:29:07,260
you know,
are excised with a good workout.

639
00:29:07,290 --> 00:29:09,260
And yet,
you know,

640
00:29:09,270 --> 00:29:12,450
that's not something that I feel like is
common wisdom.

641
00:29:12,870 --> 00:29:13,703
So when this all happened to my mom,
I started researching and I realized 

642
00:29:17,431 --> 00:29:18,420
that there's a lot of,
you know,

643
00:29:18,570 --> 00:29:23,490
insight out there both in terms of risk 
factors for developing dementia.

644
00:29:24,330 --> 00:29:25,350
Uh,
you know,

645
00:29:25,351 --> 00:29:26,184
for example,
take the Mediterranean dietary pattern 

646
00:29:27,151 --> 00:29:27,984
which we talked about before,
which is associated with reduced risks 

647
00:29:29,971 --> 00:29:31,710
of many chronic diseases.
Yeah.

648
00:29:31,750 --> 00:29:32,990
Can you explain to people what that is?
I mean,

649
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:34,810
a lot.
A lot of oils.

650
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:35,793
Yeah.
So it's characterized by being really 

651
00:29:36,731 --> 00:29:38,950
high and extra virgin olive oil,
you know,

652
00:29:39,010 --> 00:29:42,390
a glass of wine per day for women wants 
to,

653
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:43,780
for men.
Um,

654
00:29:43,781 --> 00:29:44,614
and then the way that it's typically 
defined in the medical literature is as 

655
00:29:47,111 --> 00:29:47,940
being a,
it's,

656
00:29:47,940 --> 00:29:49,810
it's defined as being a grain based 
diet.

657
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:52,050
And it all stems back from,
you know,

658
00:29:52,230 --> 00:29:55,960
this one epidemiologist named Ancil keys
who basically,

659
00:29:56,200 --> 00:29:57,033
uh,
in the 19 fifties stationed himself on 

660
00:29:58,871 --> 00:30:00,460
the island of Crete,
um,

661
00:30:00,700 --> 00:30:01,533
to look at how that population basically
ate and went about their lives in the 

662
00:30:05,681 --> 00:30:09,280
midst of a major epidemic of heart 
disease in the United States.

663
00:30:09,281 --> 00:30:10,114
He wanted to see what they were doing 
differently in the Mediterranean region 

664
00:30:12,281 --> 00:30:15,340
of the world that we might be able to 
glean some nutritional insight.

665
00:30:15,341 --> 00:30:18,520
But the problem is he,
and this is a story that's been told by,

666
00:30:18,521 --> 00:30:19,270
you know,
other people.

667
00:30:19,270 --> 00:30:20,103
There's a,
there's a great book called the big fat 

668
00:30:21,071 --> 00:30:22,150
surprise with,
you know,

669
00:30:22,330 --> 00:30:25,210
the journalist who wrote it really goes 
into depth on the story.

670
00:30:25,211 --> 00:30:28,300
But I talk about it as well.
And Genius Foods.

671
00:30:28,810 --> 00:30:30,330
Uh,
you know,

672
00:30:30,340 --> 00:30:31,990
he was stationed on the island during 
lent.

673
00:30:32,050 --> 00:30:32,883
So it was a particularly lean time just 
after World War II and his observation 

674
00:30:37,121 --> 00:30:39,700
of their dietary pattern was one way,
you know,

675
00:30:39,701 --> 00:30:41,930
it was,
it was predominantly grain based,

676
00:30:42,250 --> 00:30:43,870
um,
but people in the Mediterranean region,

677
00:30:43,871 --> 00:30:45,400
they love fatty cuts of meat,
you know,

678
00:30:45,401 --> 00:30:46,234
I have friends who were born there and 
who visit very frequently and they eat 

679
00:30:50,081 --> 00:30:52,000
very fatty cuts of meat.
Lamb,

680
00:30:52,001 --> 00:30:52,834
for example.
Yeah,

681
00:30:53,080 --> 00:30:53,913
yeah,
that's all but ignored in the medical 

682
00:30:55,841 --> 00:30:56,674
textbook definition of the Mediterranean
diet and also when you're observing the 

683
00:31:01,781 --> 00:31:04,810
population as well as what it is that 
they're eating,

684
00:31:05,470 --> 00:31:06,303
it's impossible to ascribe causality to 
any dietary element because what you're 

685
00:31:10,061 --> 00:31:12,460
observing is basically you're,
you're doing just that.

686
00:31:12,461 --> 00:31:13,294
You're observing variables,
but without doing a randomized control 

687
00:31:16,491 --> 00:31:17,324
trial,
it's impossible to prove which aspects 

688
00:31:18,911 --> 00:31:22,000
of that diet are causally related to 
the,

689
00:31:22,180 --> 00:31:23,380
you know,
the phenotypes,

690
00:31:23,381 --> 00:31:25,750
the outcomes that you're seeing in terms
of the population health.

691
00:31:25,810 --> 00:31:27,130
Right.
So,

692
00:31:27,220 --> 00:31:28,053
so that.
And that could partly also just because 

693
00:31:29,261 --> 00:31:33,670
of geography and lifestyle,
whether the amount they move around,

694
00:31:33,960 --> 00:31:35,860
if it's cold,
you might need a little more fat on your

695
00:31:35,861 --> 00:31:36,780
bones.
Exactly.

696
00:31:36,781 --> 00:31:36,950
Yeah.

697
00:31:36,950 --> 00:31:37,783
You don't know.
So you need a randomized controlled 

698
00:31:38,541 --> 00:31:39,440
trial to do that.
So what I,

699
00:31:39,441 --> 00:31:41,420
what I argue in the book is that what 
you know,

700
00:31:41,421 --> 00:31:42,254
what you see in terms of the health of 
people living in that region of the 

701
00:31:44,991 --> 00:31:48,080
world is not because of the grains that 
they're eating,

702
00:31:48,110 --> 00:31:49,910
but in spite of the Greens that they're 
reading.

703
00:31:50,600 --> 00:31:53,390
Because when you actually look at what 
Greens are,

704
00:31:53,700 --> 00:31:54,533
you know,
it's a whole lot of starch wrapped in a 

705
00:31:56,181 --> 00:31:59,900
little bit of insoluble fiber in a tiny 
amount of vitamins.

706
00:32:00,220 --> 00:32:03,860
Um,
when building a healthy diet,

707
00:32:03,861 --> 00:32:07,130
we want to really look for things that 
are nutrient dense that the brain needs.

708
00:32:07,580 --> 00:32:08,413
So,
you know,

709
00:32:08,530 --> 00:32:13,130
one of the recommendations that I make 
to people generally is to consume a huge

710
00:32:13,131 --> 00:32:17,780
salad of fatty salad every single day 
rather than eating a bowl of brown rice,

711
00:32:17,781 --> 00:32:18,614
which is pretty nutritionally sparse.
Dark leafy Greens contain a bevy of 

712
00:32:22,731 --> 00:32:25,250
micronutrients that the brain actually 
needs to create energy.

713
00:32:25,520 --> 00:32:27,140
And there's really good research.
Actually,

714
00:32:27,210 --> 00:32:28,043
a study was just published from rush 
university that found that people that 

715
00:32:31,191 --> 00:32:32,024
consume a large bowl of dark leafy 
greens per day have brains that look on 

716
00:32:35,121 --> 00:32:37,030
scans 11 years younger.
Wow.

717
00:32:37,370 --> 00:32:40,010
So yeah,
so mean there's um,

718
00:32:40,110 --> 00:32:40,943
and you also realized with some of this 
stuff that you're not missing much 

719
00:32:43,480 --> 00:32:44,313
actually.
I mean even just in this week and 

720
00:32:46,021 --> 00:32:46,854
whatever that I'm doing this diet,
I got to poke a bull yesterday and I 

721
00:32:49,381 --> 00:32:53,200
usually get brown rice on the bottom,
but I got the leafy Greens instead and I

722
00:32:53,201 --> 00:32:54,034
actually,
in a way I enjoyed it more and I felt 

723
00:32:55,770 --> 00:32:59,680
kinda slimmer after because yeah,
you're just taking it all that right?

724
00:32:59,870 --> 00:33:02,060
We're going to feel much better.
I mean your body,

725
00:33:02,120 --> 00:33:02,953
you know,
makes a lot of effort to keep certain 

726
00:33:04,581 --> 00:33:07,160
things within a very narrow margin.
So for example,

727
00:33:07,170 --> 00:33:08,003
your body temperature is one of those 
things that your body works really hard 

728
00:33:10,731 --> 00:33:14,360
to keep hovering at around 98 point six 
degrees,

729
00:33:14,361 --> 00:33:15,194
right?
The same thing with your blood sugar at 

730
00:33:16,431 --> 00:33:17,600
any given time.
You've got,

731
00:33:17,870 --> 00:33:18,703
you know,
one teaspoon of circulating sugar in 

732
00:33:20,541 --> 00:33:21,374
your body and your pancreas works very 
hard to keep your circulating blood 

733
00:33:25,161 --> 00:33:25,994
sugar at that level.
The minute you eat a massive bowl of 

734
00:33:28,371 --> 00:33:30,980
brown rice or drink a glass of orange 
juice,

735
00:33:30,981 --> 00:33:32,540
which so many Americans begin their day 
with,

736
00:33:32,780 --> 00:33:35,510
which contains about six to seven 
teaspoons of pure sugar.

737
00:33:35,511 --> 00:33:36,344
You're.
That's like a delusion of glucose being 

738
00:33:38,061 --> 00:33:42,020
shuttled straight into your blood that 
the vast majority of people don't need.

739
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:45,410
Whereas that sugar going to go,
most likely it's going to end up on your

740
00:33:45,411 --> 00:33:46,520
hips and your waist.

741
00:33:46,590 --> 00:33:48,510
Yeah,
so basically soft drinks.

742
00:33:48,511 --> 00:33:49,344
I mean I think everyone sort of knows 
this at this point in drinks it despite 

743
00:33:51,540 --> 00:33:53,430
the knowledge or at least the knowledge 
is,

744
00:33:53,450 --> 00:33:54,283
is readily accessible.
So afterwards are pretty much the worst 

745
00:33:56,731 --> 00:33:57,690
thing you can drink.
Right?

746
00:33:57,691 --> 00:33:59,910
I mean the amount of sugar there is just
insane.

747
00:34:00,010 --> 00:34:01,520
Horrible.
I mean the.

748
00:34:01,550 --> 00:34:06,550
There's no requirement for consuming a 
added sugar.

749
00:34:07,240 --> 00:34:08,073
A lot of people actually feel that they 
need sugar to fuel their brain because 

750
00:34:12,941 --> 00:34:13,774
of the boost and executive function that
they feel after consuming a food that's 

751
00:34:19,181 --> 00:34:22,960
sugary or a granola bar or you know,
any carb rich food,

752
00:34:22,961 --> 00:34:27,520
but really so many people are hooked on 
glucose as a fuel for the brain.

753
00:34:27,521 --> 00:34:28,354
That in reality what they're doing is 
they're treating their withdrawal from 

754
00:34:30,521 --> 00:34:33,490
sugar from the previous meal and that's 
why they feel boost.

755
00:34:33,710 --> 00:34:36,770
So basically you have the soda at lunch 
and then you,

756
00:34:36,860 --> 00:34:39,320
you're having that crash like two hours 
later and you're like,

757
00:34:39,321 --> 00:34:41,000
oh,
I need that bar.

758
00:34:41,001 --> 00:34:41,490
That has.

759
00:34:41,490 --> 00:34:42,380
Exactly.
Yeah.

760
00:34:42,450 --> 00:34:44,430
And it tricks you have tricks,
but I mean it's,

761
00:34:44,820 --> 00:34:45,653
it's,
there's a good reason that you feel 

762
00:34:46,381 --> 00:34:49,890
tricked and that you feel like these 
foods are your friends because you know,

763
00:34:49,950 --> 00:34:53,310
when you're on that sort of glucose 
roller coaster throughout the day,

764
00:34:53,550 --> 00:34:56,040
you need those constant pick me up.
So that's the problem.

765
00:34:56,041 --> 00:34:56,874
So what I think you know is a,
is a more sustainable way of having 

766
00:35:01,860 --> 00:35:02,693
energy.
Cognitive resilience is to step off of 

767
00:35:05,101 --> 00:35:07,710
that,
that train the glucose train,

768
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:08,993
and really reacquaint yourself with 
healthy fats and foods that are much 

769
00:35:11,941 --> 00:35:12,774
lower in carbohydrates and much richer 
in the nutrients that your brain 

770
00:35:15,661 --> 00:35:16,420
actually needs.

771
00:35:16,420 --> 00:35:17,253
All right.
I want to get down to all the things we 

772
00:35:18,651 --> 00:35:22,610
should be eating.
We talked about green leafy things,

773
00:35:23,660 --> 00:35:26,900
but there's a lot more to it than that.
That's what a lot of this is about.

774
00:35:27,110 --> 00:35:28,910
So let's get to it.
If you want to.

775
00:35:29,150 --> 00:35:32,870
Someone's watching this right now.
Maybe they're eating poorly.

776
00:35:32,930 --> 00:35:33,763
Maybe they're eating okay.
Maybe they think they're doing a pretty 

777
00:35:35,181 --> 00:35:38,430
good job,
but they want to just kind of reset.

778
00:35:39,270 --> 00:35:40,550
Take them from one.

779
00:35:41,030 --> 00:35:41,540
Yeah.
So I mean,

780
00:35:41,540 --> 00:35:42,373
I think the first thing that people 
should do is really cut out the 

781
00:35:44,091 --> 00:35:46,640
processed foods,
which is harder than it seems.

782
00:35:46,641 --> 00:35:47,261
You know,
and,

783
00:35:47,261 --> 00:35:48,094
and I definitely,
my heart goes out to people that feel 

784
00:35:49,671 --> 00:35:52,100
like they can't give up the junk food 
because again,

785
00:35:52,101 --> 00:35:52,934
you know,
these foods are not designed to be 

786
00:35:53,931 --> 00:35:54,764
consumed in moderation.
The advice to eat everything in 

787
00:35:56,211 --> 00:35:59,120
moderation is horrible in the modern 
world,

788
00:35:59,121 --> 00:35:59,954
in the modern supermarket.
Literally our supermarket aisles or are 

789
00:36:03,141 --> 00:36:06,890
lined with foods that are designed by 
scientists that are paid a lot more than

790
00:36:06,891 --> 00:36:10,970
you and I to to create insatiable 
overconsumption and addiction.

791
00:36:11,010 --> 00:36:11,491
Yeah.
Wait,

792
00:36:11,491 --> 00:36:13,500
let's,
let's focus on that for a second because

793
00:36:13,620 --> 00:36:16,560
it sounds like it's not true,
but it's actually true.

794
00:36:16,561 --> 00:36:18,900
Like they actually have people working 
on.

795
00:36:19,140 --> 00:36:21,110
Isn't this what they did with Doritos 
originally?

796
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:22,120
I think.
I think.

797
00:36:22,130 --> 00:36:22,963
I think that they.
I mean that cool ranch flavor I usually 

798
00:36:25,381 --> 00:36:26,214
just to.
I literally used to just lick those 

799
00:36:28,231 --> 00:36:29,760
chips.
You don't want to hear your fingers.

800
00:36:29,820 --> 00:36:30,600
Yeah,
yeah,

801
00:36:30,600 --> 00:36:31,433
yeah.
So there are literally scientists 

802
00:36:32,971 --> 00:36:37,730
working for these companies making you 
want more and more and more.

803
00:36:38,010 --> 00:36:41,250
Absolutely.
These foods which now make up against 60

804
00:36:41,251 --> 00:36:42,084
percent of the calories consumed in the 
US are designed to screw up your brain 

805
00:36:45,090 --> 00:36:47,940
and usually what happens is the 
scientist will combine some parts,

806
00:36:47,941 --> 00:36:48,930
sugar,
wheat,

807
00:36:48,990 --> 00:36:49,823
usually with fat and salt,
and it creates this unique mixture of 

808
00:36:54,181 --> 00:36:55,650
delectable,
you know,

809
00:36:55,670 --> 00:36:58,240
mouth feel as well as just,
you know,

810
00:36:58,250 --> 00:36:59,083
the,
the,

811
00:36:59,580 --> 00:37:04,050
the exact sensation that we've evolved 
basically to seek out more of.

812
00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:06,720
It just sets off dopamine,
fireworks and our brain.

813
00:37:06,890 --> 00:37:07,723
Is that actually the same thing that 
happens to your brand when you do drugs 

814
00:37:10,791 --> 00:37:11,990
and then you need more drugs?
I mean,

815
00:37:11,991 --> 00:37:14,410
is it really the same chemical reactions
that your head?

816
00:37:14,630 --> 00:37:15,680
Yeah,
absolutely.

817
00:37:15,681 --> 00:37:17,910
If not worse.
I mean they've done studies on,

818
00:37:18,170 --> 00:37:20,410
on animals rats for example,
um,

819
00:37:20,420 --> 00:37:21,253
which are all ID basically in rats 
provide a really great look into the 

820
00:37:24,951 --> 00:37:27,830
behavior that certain foods drive 
because you know,

821
00:37:27,831 --> 00:37:28,664
they've got no super ego to,
to steer them from what it is that they 

822
00:37:31,581 --> 00:37:32,414
really want to do it.
So they've shown that rats actually 

823
00:37:34,491 --> 00:37:35,324
prefer sugar to cocaine,
which is funny because I was really 

824
00:37:37,101 --> 00:37:37,934
like,
okay,

825
00:37:38,890 --> 00:37:39,920
rats really like,
okay.

826
00:37:39,921 --> 00:37:40,754
And they really like,
okay.

827
00:37:41,250 --> 00:37:42,890
Yeah.
But um,

828
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:43,873
no,
I mean we tend to think of ourselves as 

829
00:37:45,831 --> 00:37:47,690
having had like a moral failure,
right?

830
00:37:47,691 --> 00:37:48,524
Like when we go through a whole bag of 
chips or like eat the whole pint of ice 

831
00:37:51,021 --> 00:37:51,980
cream.
But again,

832
00:37:51,981 --> 00:37:54,890
like these foods are not designed to be 
consumed in moderation.

833
00:37:54,891 --> 00:37:59,630
They're designed literally to have you 
finish that whole pint or that whole bag

834
00:37:59,631 --> 00:38:01,160
and then go back as a repeat customer.

835
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:02,640
Yeah.
I always think the branding of it.

836
00:38:02,641 --> 00:38:05,460
It's so funny to like,
you see all these things like guilt free

837
00:38:05,461 --> 00:38:10,320
chips or don't feel bad about how fat 
you are already at this stuff.

838
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:13,200
And it's like it's all this weird 
psychological play to,

839
00:38:13,290 --> 00:38:14,910
to get you to keep eating all this.
No.

840
00:38:15,020 --> 00:38:15,853
Once you pop you can't stop.
It's like a truism with scientific 

841
00:38:17,871 --> 00:38:18,681
backing.
Yeah.

842
00:38:18,681 --> 00:38:19,330
At this point.

843
00:38:19,330 --> 00:38:21,740
All right,
so the reset person that's watching this

844
00:38:21,741 --> 00:38:23,190
right now,
that's going to start doing some stuff.

845
00:38:23,230 --> 00:38:24,063
Okay.
Get the process stuff out and that 

846
00:38:24,981 --> 00:38:25,814
includes,
like,

847
00:38:25,820 --> 00:38:28,430
that's pretty much all the stuff that 
you see in the frozen section.

848
00:38:28,730 --> 00:38:29,563
Like all,
like all of that frozen breakfast stuff 

849
00:38:31,881 --> 00:38:33,800
and all of those sandwiches and all 
that.

850
00:38:34,010 --> 00:38:35,010
Definitely.
Um,

851
00:38:35,080 --> 00:38:36,370
and actually,
you know,

852
00:38:36,371 --> 00:38:37,204
a really good recommendation for people 
that are really trying to make this 

853
00:38:40,091 --> 00:38:42,700
change is to first actually,
which is kind of counterintuitive,

854
00:38:42,701 --> 00:38:44,740
but to work on your sleep.
Sleep,

855
00:38:44,830 --> 00:38:47,770
I like to say,
allows a person to getting good quality,

856
00:38:47,771 --> 00:38:51,100
adequate sleep,
gives a person the hormonal fortitude to

857
00:38:51,101 --> 00:38:53,640
make those dietary changes.
So when you,

858
00:38:53,641 --> 00:38:55,240
you know,
when you're under slept,

859
00:38:55,390 --> 00:38:59,740
actually study was just put out showing 
that people tend to over consume and eat

860
00:38:59,860 --> 00:39:03,580
excess calories predominantly from these
exact kinds of foods.

861
00:39:03,970 --> 00:39:06,910
So yeah,
optimizing sleep and then

862
00:39:07,060 --> 00:39:10,390
what do they say on sleep?
Like how is it eight hours really?

863
00:39:10,391 --> 00:39:11,670
Is that what they wanted for like the 
average?

864
00:39:11,860 --> 00:39:12,693
Yeah,
eight hours is a good amount and that's 

865
00:39:14,590 --> 00:39:18,340
also roughly the amount of sleep that 
you need to maximize growth hormone,

866
00:39:18,820 --> 00:39:19,653
which is uh,
an important hormone in the body for 

867
00:39:20,740 --> 00:39:23,110
preserving lean mass.
Um,

868
00:39:23,860 --> 00:39:24,760
but yeah,
I mean,

869
00:39:24,810 --> 00:39:25,643
and quality sleep as well.
So I mean not just getting those eight 

870
00:39:27,401 --> 00:39:28,234
hours,
but making sure that those eight hours 

871
00:39:28,901 --> 00:39:33,901
are really super high quality and we can
get into ways of optimizing sleep.

872
00:39:34,571 --> 00:39:35,404
I guess one of the,
one of the best ways that I like to 

873
00:39:36,281 --> 00:39:37,114
optimize my sleep and I find it to be 
very effective is to limit my exposure 

874
00:39:40,271 --> 00:39:43,630
to screens at night.
Um,

875
00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:47,050
because what time do you shut down?
I shut down.

876
00:39:47,051 --> 00:39:50,980
I try to shut down two to three hours 
before bed or if I,

877
00:39:50,981 --> 00:39:54,310
if I'm not shutting down and I have to 
work up until the point at which,

878
00:39:54,340 --> 00:39:54,971
you know,
I go to bed.

879
00:39:54,971 --> 00:39:56,650
I mean let's face it,
living in the real world,

880
00:39:56,651 --> 00:39:57,484
you know,
sometimes we have to respond to an 

881
00:39:59,021 --> 00:40:03,220
urgent email.
I use blue light blocking glasses,

882
00:40:04,360 --> 00:40:05,193
which I'm a big fan of actually.
And there's good research on amber 

883
00:40:06,881 --> 00:40:07,714
colored glasses and their ability to 
sort of mitigate some of the loss of 

884
00:40:11,621 --> 00:40:12,454
Melatonin.

885
00:40:12,540 --> 00:40:13,373
Do you know,
is that the same effect that the iphone 

886
00:40:15,301 --> 00:40:17,580
has now with their night thing?
Is that,

887
00:40:17,581 --> 00:40:19,070
that same thing?
I'm not sure

888
00:40:20,070 --> 00:40:21,700
filter on.
Um,

889
00:40:21,860 --> 00:40:23,910
I'm not sure if it's comparable 
actually.

890
00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:25,073
It feel,
it certainly feels way better to my 

891
00:40:26,551 --> 00:40:27,900
eyes.
Um,

892
00:40:27,930 --> 00:40:30,430
when night shift is on.
Um,

893
00:40:30,630 --> 00:40:33,300
but yeah,
I mean I noticed that when I,

894
00:40:33,900 --> 00:40:36,090
so in my house in New York,
I've got a,

895
00:40:36,210 --> 00:40:37,710
it's my brothers,
I live with my brother.

896
00:40:38,280 --> 00:40:39,113
He has a massive TV.
It's like 85 inches or just one of the 

897
00:40:41,701 --> 00:40:45,480
biggest monster is in television I've 
ever seen in my life and you know,

898
00:40:45,481 --> 00:40:46,314
he likes to watch movies up until the 
point at which she goes to bed and 

899
00:40:48,930 --> 00:40:50,940
that's not my preference,
but uh,

900
00:40:50,941 --> 00:40:51,774
I do that with him sometimes and I'll 
watch like a movie up until like 

901
00:40:54,540 --> 00:40:58,980
midnight or something and I notice that 
when I have that amount of light pouring

902
00:40:58,981 --> 00:41:01,410
into my face when I go to bed right 
after that,

903
00:41:01,540 --> 00:41:05,280
I'll oftentimes actually wake up feeling
hung over even though I've never,

904
00:41:05,281 --> 00:41:07,770
I've had the eight hours of sleep and I 
hadn't had any alcohol.

905
00:41:08,010 --> 00:41:11,220
I just feel under slept and not 
rejuvenated.

906
00:41:11,221 --> 00:41:15,120
Whereas when I wear the blue light 
blocking glasses and I have no,

907
00:41:15,150 --> 00:41:17,010
you know,
I'm not a,

908
00:41:17,330 --> 00:41:18,163
you know,
formally affiliated with any of these 

909
00:41:19,501 --> 00:41:21,540
companies.
Don't manufacture them in any sense.

910
00:41:21,541 --> 00:41:23,220
But uh,
but I do find that they work.

911
00:41:23,221 --> 00:41:24,990
I work,
I wake up feeling a lot more refreshed.

912
00:41:25,230 --> 00:41:26,120
Yeah.
Well,

913
00:41:26,150 --> 00:41:26,983
I think that the digital piece of this 
is so interesting because I talk about 

914
00:41:29,631 --> 00:41:30,464
it with almost every guest.
Just the frustration with social media 

915
00:41:33,110 --> 00:41:35,700
and not putting this stuff down and 
digital addiction and,

916
00:41:35,880 --> 00:41:36,713
and all of this and it's like,
one of the things that I've tried to do 

917
00:41:38,361 --> 00:41:39,194
is I never bring my phone into my room 
anymore bedroom where I just stopped 

918
00:41:41,931 --> 00:41:43,310
doing it because I realized,
wow,

919
00:41:43,580 --> 00:41:44,413
right before I go to bed,
I'm looking at my phone and then 

920
00:41:45,621 --> 00:41:47,750
literally the first thing I do when I 
wake up,

921
00:41:48,170 --> 00:41:50,540
before I brush my teeth,
before I go to the bathroom,

922
00:41:50,780 --> 00:41:52,970
it's,
I'm suddenly looking at my phone again.

923
00:41:52,971 --> 00:41:56,320
Like even if it's all wonderful news,
it's probably not an,

924
00:41:56,450 --> 00:41:58,850
it's usually not,
but even if it was,

925
00:41:58,851 --> 00:42:00,710
it's probably not a great way to start 
so that.

926
00:42:00,711 --> 00:42:01,544
And I've really,
really been trying to do no technology 

927
00:42:03,351 --> 00:42:06,590
on the weekends and I think and I think 
that that's really helped.

928
00:42:06,740 --> 00:42:10,030
So is there some sort of connection 
between all of that and,

929
00:42:10,031 --> 00:42:14,900
and like just the digital monster that's
affecting our brain to.

930
00:42:15,260 --> 00:42:16,720
Yeah,
I mean there's no yelling,

931
00:42:16,730 --> 00:42:17,980
just like,
you know what I mean,

932
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:19,150
like something else happened.
Well,

933
00:42:19,151 --> 00:42:21,320
yeah,
I mean I think from a mood standpoint,

934
00:42:21,321 --> 00:42:22,600
for sure.
I mean like you know,

935
00:42:22,640 --> 00:42:23,473
our stress response evolved at a time 
when things that were stressful to us 

936
00:42:26,031 --> 00:42:31,031
required our immediate attention.
So a bear in your face like this,

937
00:42:32,041 --> 00:42:32,874
like protracted,
longterm psychological stress that so 

938
00:42:35,361 --> 00:42:36,430
many of us have,
you know,

939
00:42:36,500 --> 00:42:37,333
so commonly today is a fairly new 
invention and on the evolutionary 

940
00:42:40,671 --> 00:42:42,950
timescale and the media,
for example,

941
00:42:42,951 --> 00:42:45,770
knows this and app developers,
APP developers know this.

942
00:42:45,771 --> 00:42:49,610
That's why like you turn on any news 
station,

943
00:42:49,670 --> 00:42:53,240
local news especially they abide by the.
If it bleeds,

944
00:42:53,241 --> 00:42:54,074
it leads mentality,
put the most anxiety inducing segment 

945
00:42:57,350 --> 00:42:58,183
upfront or tease at it at least so that 
it causes an expression of a or an 

946
00:43:02,361 --> 00:43:04,460
upregulation of norepinephrine in the 
brain,

947
00:43:04,461 --> 00:43:05,294
which is basically the brain's focus and
attention neurotransmitter associated 

948
00:43:07,971 --> 00:43:08,804
with stress.

949
00:43:08,810 --> 00:43:11,830
And that's something that you know in 
it,

950
00:43:11,890 --> 00:43:14,450
it makes you more alert.
It makes you feel more awake.

951
00:43:14,750 --> 00:43:16,880
And so when you read,
know,

952
00:43:16,970 --> 00:43:18,900
doom and gloom news on your,
on your smartphone,

953
00:43:18,920 --> 00:43:21,500
you're basically having the same exact 
stress response.

954
00:43:21,800 --> 00:43:22,633
It's funny how when you step away from 
it a little bit to how silly it almost 

955
00:43:25,491 --> 00:43:26,324
seems.
So like when I get away on the weekend 

956
00:43:27,890 --> 00:43:28,723
and then I'm back on Monday,
if I look back at anything that might 

957
00:43:30,781 --> 00:43:32,150
have happened and I see all these people
fight,

958
00:43:32,151 --> 00:43:32,900
I'm like,
wow,

959
00:43:32,900 --> 00:43:35,840
you all spent your weekend fighting 
about this stuff.

960
00:43:35,841 --> 00:43:38,720
It's one thing that we're doing it on 
the weekdays and maybe we can all manage

961
00:43:38,721 --> 00:43:39,554
that myself included.
Maybe we can all manage that a little 

962
00:43:41,211 --> 00:43:42,044
differently.
But that endless sort of no way out 

963
00:43:47,060 --> 00:43:47,621
thing.
It's,

964
00:43:47,621 --> 00:43:49,310
it's a lot.
It also.

965
00:43:49,311 --> 00:43:51,140
Yeah,
I mean I'm not as familiar with the.

966
00:43:51,170 --> 00:43:52,003
There was a,
there was a study that came out showing 

967
00:43:54,411 --> 00:43:55,244
that just having your smart phone around
you is exhausting from a cognitive 

968
00:43:58,761 --> 00:44:01,160
standpoint.
You know,

969
00:44:01,161 --> 00:44:03,950
just having it around and sort of 
feeling that poll.

970
00:44:04,280 --> 00:44:05,113
We get addicted to it.
I mean it sort of hijacks our dopamine 

971
00:44:08,031 --> 00:44:09,360
systems as well.
You know,

972
00:44:09,410 --> 00:44:11,420
being addicted to social media,
that's a real thing.

973
00:44:11,690 --> 00:44:12,523
It's interesting to me though because 
people watch this show and we know what 

974
00:44:15,531 --> 00:44:18,530
our watch times are and they're off the 
charts for for Youtube,

975
00:44:18,531 --> 00:44:19,364
which usually has like a seven second 
watch anime or something and that shows 

976
00:44:22,011 --> 00:44:22,844
to me that people want long form.
They actually want something that is in 

977
00:44:26,750 --> 00:44:29,000
so insulting to their senses,
to their brain.

978
00:44:29,060 --> 00:44:29,893
Now ironically many people are watching 
this right now or listening on their 

979
00:44:32,281 --> 00:44:33,114
phones,
but a lot of people listen on their 

980
00:44:34,201 --> 00:44:36,590
phones while they're doing exercise or 
while they're commuting or something,

981
00:44:36,840 --> 00:44:39,270
but I do sense that people want 
something else,

982
00:44:39,271 --> 00:44:42,240
so it's like the news is giving us the 
local news as you're saying,

983
00:44:42,241 --> 00:44:43,074
they're giving us something we don't 
want because they know they'll keep us 

984
00:44:44,881 --> 00:44:45,714
there,
but food companies are giving us 

985
00:44:46,651 --> 00:44:49,440
something that's not good for us because
they know it'll keep us there.

986
00:44:49,560 --> 00:44:50,393
We now know Tristan Harris,
who I've had on talked about how the 

987
00:44:53,490 --> 00:44:55,200
tech companies,
and you just alluded to this,

988
00:44:55,201 --> 00:44:58,020
are giving us things that they know are 
bad for us,

989
00:44:58,021 --> 00:45:02,460
so it really is your job.
It's like a full time job now as a human

990
00:45:02,461 --> 00:45:05,310
to be like,
I'm going to do the things that actually

991
00:45:05,311 --> 00:45:06,810
argued for me,
not the things you keep

992
00:45:06,870 --> 00:45:07,500
feeding.
Well,

993
00:45:07,500 --> 00:45:08,333
exactly.
That's why I think it's such a shame 

994
00:45:11,341 --> 00:45:15,420
because we each are heir to this amazing
gift,

995
00:45:15,421 --> 00:45:16,350
right?
The human brain.

996
00:45:16,351 --> 00:45:18,060
Yet the modern world is like the hunger 
games,

997
00:45:18,061 --> 00:45:18,894
right?
Like attacking it from every which way 

998
00:45:21,420 --> 00:45:24,660
and we are not equipped with the tools 
to understand,

999
00:45:25,740 --> 00:45:26,573
you know,
what to do to sort of fix that 

1000
00:45:28,441 --> 00:45:31,090
situation.
And so yeah,

1001
00:45:31,091 --> 00:45:31,924
I mean,
I definitely recommend people taking a 

1002
00:45:32,641 --> 00:45:36,330
break from social media,
from news.

1003
00:45:36,331 --> 00:45:39,360
The 24 hour news cycle I think is just 
not healthy.

1004
00:45:39,740 --> 00:45:41,850
Um,
and then also certainly food.

1005
00:45:42,130 --> 00:45:44,220
I think food is a major part of it.
Lifestyle,

1006
00:45:44,690 --> 00:45:46,020
you know,
one of the things that I talked about in

1007
00:45:46,021 --> 00:45:48,480
the book we go into depth is the fact 
that,

1008
00:45:48,650 --> 00:45:49,483
you know,
not only are we more sedentary than 

1009
00:45:50,701 --> 00:45:53,670
we've ever been,
not getting enough exercise a boat,

1010
00:45:53,730 --> 00:45:54,361
you know,
there's a,

1011
00:45:54,361 --> 00:45:55,194
there was another form of exercise that 
we all had for the majority of our 

1012
00:45:58,081 --> 00:46:00,390
evolution and that is thermal exercise,
you know,

1013
00:46:00,391 --> 00:46:02,060
today we live in a time where,
you know,

1014
00:46:02,150 --> 00:46:04,590
there's chronic climate control,
you know,

1015
00:46:04,591 --> 00:46:07,710
and that's something that seems to be to
the detriment of our metabolisms.

1016
00:46:08,040 --> 00:46:10,850
So I talk about how you can use,
you know,

1017
00:46:10,860 --> 00:46:13,480
cold showers to enhance vigilance.
Um,

1018
00:46:13,500 --> 00:46:17,160
which is one of the few things that you 
can do that you actually feel a shift in

1019
00:46:17,161 --> 00:46:17,994
your consciousness.

1020
00:46:19,140 --> 00:46:21,180
Are you big on that?
There are these people that like,

1021
00:46:21,181 --> 00:46:23,310
jumped from like the hot tub to a 
freezing cold.

1022
00:46:23,700 --> 00:46:26,050
I do that.
Maybe it was you that I've heard it.

1023
00:46:26,080 --> 00:46:26,913
So I knew what you were,
you took a picture like in a pool or 

1024
00:46:28,531 --> 00:46:29,364
something.
So it must have been used I think the 

1025
00:46:30,511 --> 00:46:31,920
first time I saw it.
So what is that?

1026
00:46:31,921 --> 00:46:32,754
So you're jumping from hot water,
the cold water in your system is just 

1027
00:46:34,351 --> 00:46:36,030
like constantly rebooting.

1028
00:46:36,170 --> 00:46:36,830
Yeah,
well it's good.

1029
00:46:36,830 --> 00:46:39,080
It's called contrast therapy.
So basically,

1030
00:46:39,081 --> 00:46:39,914
you know,
when you're.

1031
00:46:40,160 --> 00:46:44,150
And a lot of the mechanisms are sort of 
conserved between the two activities.

1032
00:46:44,151 --> 00:46:46,010
So you know,
when you go into a cold,

1033
00:46:47,060 --> 00:46:48,620
when you go into like a sauna for 
example,

1034
00:46:49,040 --> 00:46:51,110
you're activating something called heat 
shock proteins,

1035
00:46:51,111 --> 00:46:51,944
which are there to sort of guard the 
proteins in your body against a 

1036
00:46:54,711 --> 00:46:55,544
disfigurement,
which is really important because a lot 

1037
00:46:56,691 --> 00:46:57,830
of the diseases that we're talking 
about,

1038
00:46:57,831 --> 00:46:58,664
Alzheimer's disease,
Parkinson's disease are associated with 

1039
00:47:00,861 --> 00:47:03,890
misfolded proteins.
So anytime we can sort of activate these

1040
00:47:03,891 --> 00:47:06,810
heat shock proteins seems to be helpful.
Um,

1041
00:47:07,360 --> 00:47:10,430
there are also activated when you expose
yourself to cold air.

1042
00:47:10,730 --> 00:47:12,470
Um,
yeah,

1043
00:47:12,471 --> 00:47:14,060
there's really good.
There's really good research.

1044
00:47:14,061 --> 00:47:14,894
A lot of people now are practicing cryo 
therapy as a means of enhancing 

1045
00:47:17,920 --> 00:47:20,270
vigilance,
reducing inflammation,

1046
00:47:20,300 --> 00:47:21,133
boosting metabolism,
increasing the proliferation of Brown 

1047
00:47:23,661 --> 00:47:26,180
fat.
We all have a kind of fat in asset.

1048
00:47:26,210 --> 00:47:29,750
It wasn't thought that adults carried it
with them past a,

1049
00:47:30,760 --> 00:47:32,890
you know,
a childhood or infancy.

1050
00:47:33,220 --> 00:47:33,820
But,
um,

1051
00:47:33,820 --> 00:47:36,880
now we know that we actually have this 
sort of fat that's actually a good fat,

1052
00:47:36,881 --> 00:47:37,714
the fat that we want more of because 
it's metabolically active and it burns 

1053
00:47:40,091 --> 00:47:42,110
calories.
So by going into cold and,

1054
00:47:42,300 --> 00:47:45,460
and are keeping ourselves exposed to um,
you know,

1055
00:47:45,700 --> 00:47:46,533
intermittent cooler temperatures,
we actually encourage the proliferation 

1056
00:47:50,591 --> 00:47:51,610
of this,
which is really cool.

1057
00:47:51,720 --> 00:47:54,790
So I thought by moving to La and being 
an 80 degrees everyday,

1058
00:47:54,910 --> 00:47:56,040
it was good.
That was good thing.

1059
00:47:56,190 --> 00:48:00,300
I guess it's good for my vitamin D but 
for some of this other stuff.

1060
00:48:00,360 --> 00:48:01,200
Yeah.
Yeah.

1061
00:48:01,201 --> 00:48:02,790
So,
so I think getting back to that,

1062
00:48:02,790 --> 00:48:03,623
you know,
I'm having a little bit more thermal 

1063
00:48:05,881 --> 00:48:06,714
stress in our lives is important.
They've done really good research on 

1064
00:48:08,671 --> 00:48:10,620
people with type two diabetes and have 
found that,

1065
00:48:10,760 --> 00:48:13,860
you know,
even mild cold below or higher,

1066
00:48:13,861 --> 00:48:16,950
I should say then then what would be 
like a freezing temperature,

1067
00:48:17,490 --> 00:48:18,323
does it improve insulin sensitivity,
which is sort of the hallmark of 

1068
00:48:20,791 --> 00:48:22,410
metabolic health.
Um,

1069
00:48:22,411 --> 00:48:25,380
which is really interesting.
It's a way to improve your health,

1070
00:48:26,080 --> 00:48:28,290
um,
without even doing anything.

1071
00:48:28,291 --> 00:48:29,124
I mean,
you can basically just turn the dial on 

1072
00:48:29,911 --> 00:48:31,680
your air conditioner down a little bit 
more.

1073
00:48:31,810 --> 00:48:32,471
Yeah.
All right,

1074
00:48:32,471 --> 00:48:33,304
so now let's circle back.
This person starts that we're this 

1075
00:48:36,251 --> 00:48:38,350
imaginary person that we're talking 
about this watching right now.

1076
00:48:38,351 --> 00:48:38,801
I'm going,
all right,

1077
00:48:38,801 --> 00:48:40,120
I'm going to incorporate some of that 
stuff.

1078
00:48:40,510 --> 00:48:43,090
They're going to get the Eggos Leggo my 
Eggo.

1079
00:48:43,360 --> 00:48:45,520
You're going to get that out of the way.
Processed food in the morning.

1080
00:48:45,790 --> 00:48:49,960
What are they replacing that with your 
breakfast for dark this day.

1081
00:48:50,010 --> 00:48:50,430
Okay,

1082
00:48:50,430 --> 00:48:51,181
let's start the day.
Well,

1083
00:48:51,181 --> 00:48:52,014
first of all,
there's no biological need for 

1084
00:48:53,071 --> 00:48:54,930
breakfast,
so let's just get,

1085
00:48:54,931 --> 00:48:56,310
you know,
get that out of the picture.

1086
00:48:56,400 --> 00:48:58,680
But I thought breakfast was the most 
important meal of the day.

1087
00:48:58,830 --> 00:49:01,170
The meal that you break your fast with 
is important,

1088
00:49:01,230 --> 00:49:04,890
but there's no biological need to eat as
soon as you wake up.

1089
00:49:05,220 --> 00:49:06,053
So whether you push that first meal an 
hour after you wake up or two hours 

1090
00:49:09,001 --> 00:49:10,710
after you wake up,
you should be able to do that.

1091
00:49:10,711 --> 00:49:11,544
I mean,
breakfast is a fairly new construct in 

1092
00:49:13,831 --> 00:49:17,700
the evolutionary sense and also when you
wake up first thing in the morning,

1093
00:49:17,701 --> 00:49:20,990
your body has a real unique hormonal,
um,

1094
00:49:21,020 --> 00:49:23,600
mill you where it wants to burn fat.
You know,

1095
00:49:23,830 --> 00:49:26,910
cortisol is at its highest peaks 
immediately after you wake up.

1096
00:49:27,180 --> 00:49:29,500
And Cortisol is sort of like the body's 
fat burning hormone.

1097
00:49:29,501 --> 00:49:31,380
It's the body's chief,
catabolic hormone,

1098
00:49:31,740 --> 00:49:34,020
liberates stored fatty acids,
sugars,

1099
00:49:34,021 --> 00:49:36,100
proteins.
Um,

1100
00:49:36,420 --> 00:49:39,210
and so to throw breakfast into that 
equation,

1101
00:49:39,240 --> 00:49:43,170
especially in the most commonly,
the most commonly consumed form of it,

1102
00:49:43,171 --> 00:49:44,010
which is,
you know,

1103
00:49:44,011 --> 00:49:45,420
as you said,
like a Lego,

1104
00:49:45,510 --> 00:49:47,180
an Eggo waffle.
Yeah.

1105
00:49:48,050 --> 00:49:50,960
No offense.
Dad Go and Doritos before you know,

1106
00:49:51,940 --> 00:49:53,650
it is naming some things here.
Yeah.

1107
00:49:53,700 --> 00:49:54,440
Um,
yeah.

1108
00:49:54,440 --> 00:49:57,950
So for the person though that wants to 
have something in the morning,

1109
00:49:58,590 --> 00:50:01,860
fiber and protein,
so eggs are a perfect foods.

1110
00:50:01,861 --> 00:50:04,980
You eat first thing in the morning.
I'm a scramble,

1111
00:50:04,981 --> 00:50:06,480
for example,
with some spinach,

1112
00:50:06,510 --> 00:50:10,410
Kale and some extra virgin olive oil.
Or You could use a little bit of coconut

1113
00:50:10,411 --> 00:50:11,370
oil.
That's a,

1114
00:50:11,390 --> 00:50:12,223
you know,
great.

1115
00:50:12,540 --> 00:50:13,470
You didn't have a condo.

1116
00:50:13,600 --> 00:50:15,220
Are those the two good oils?
Because every,

1117
00:50:15,230 --> 00:50:17,360
I feel like every year someone says,
seed oil,

1118
00:50:17,370 --> 00:50:19,570
I was good.
Now I know I saw on your website,

1119
00:50:19,600 --> 00:50:22,870
get rid of the oil.
Nothing to do with grape seed oil.

1120
00:50:22,871 --> 00:50:23,704
Okay,
no problem.

1121
00:50:23,870 --> 00:50:27,950
But when you're cooking you.
So basically you're saying oil or,

1122
00:50:28,360 --> 00:50:31,820
or you can actually cook with extra 
virgin olive oil.

1123
00:50:31,821 --> 00:50:32,730
It maintains,
you know,

1124
00:50:32,750 --> 00:50:36,890
it doesn't oxidize the way some of these
awful green and seed oils will,

1125
00:50:37,140 --> 00:50:38,420
um,
corn oil,

1126
00:50:38,421 --> 00:50:39,650
soybean oil,
canola oil,

1127
00:50:39,651 --> 00:50:40,580
grapeseed oil.
These are the words.

1128
00:50:40,780 --> 00:50:41,613
Yeah,
that's basically like the smoke point 

1129
00:50:42,621 --> 00:50:43,221
part,
right?

1130
00:50:43,221 --> 00:50:44,090
Where it becomes

1131
00:50:44,180 --> 00:50:45,350
actually,
interestingly,

1132
00:50:45,620 --> 00:50:49,340
and this is a question I get asked a lot
smoke point and the temperature at which

1133
00:50:49,440 --> 00:50:52,400
an oil oxidizes there.
There's no relationship.

1134
00:50:52,640 --> 00:50:53,473
So smoke point is something that's like 
a culinary concern more than anything 

1135
00:50:56,181 --> 00:50:59,030
else.
And in fact these oils like canola oil,

1136
00:50:59,060 --> 00:50:59,893
corn oil,
soybean oil are so heavily processed in 

1137
00:51:01,911 --> 00:51:04,070
order for them to have a high smoke 
point,

1138
00:51:04,370 --> 00:51:07,040
but actually they become rancid at much 
lower temperatures.

1139
00:51:07,370 --> 00:51:08,540
Whereas you take a,
you know,

1140
00:51:08,541 --> 00:51:09,650
like a fat,
like butter,

1141
00:51:09,920 --> 00:51:12,260
butter will start to smoke pretty early 
on,

1142
00:51:12,261 --> 00:51:15,050
but it's not because of the fat 
oxidizing is because of the proteins and

1143
00:51:15,051 --> 00:51:15,884
the case,
the trace a lactose and casein found in 

1144
00:51:18,321 --> 00:51:19,154
butter,
but that actually has no bearing on 

1145
00:51:21,021 --> 00:51:23,120
whether or not it's good or bad for you.

1146
00:51:23,290 --> 00:51:25,450
So basically though,
if you were making,

1147
00:51:25,500 --> 00:51:26,870
you know,
an egg omelet.

1148
00:51:26,930 --> 00:51:27,380
Yeah,
use,

1149
00:51:27,380 --> 00:51:30,790
use some Kale and spinach.
You're talking about olive oil,

1150
00:51:30,791 --> 00:51:33,100
you're talking about coconut oil,
butter or butter.

1151
00:51:33,130 --> 00:51:33,530
Yeah,

1152
00:51:33,530 --> 00:51:34,370
yeah,
exactly.

1153
00:51:34,840 --> 00:51:35,810
Um,
yeah,

1154
00:51:35,811 --> 00:51:36,644
because you know,
the more saturated in oil is the more 

1155
00:51:38,931 --> 00:51:41,600
chemically stable it's going to be at 
higher temperatures.

1156
00:51:41,630 --> 00:51:44,060
So higher heat cooking.
You want to use coconut oil,

1157
00:51:44,061 --> 00:51:45,860
butter,
ghee,

1158
00:51:46,340 --> 00:51:47,270
Lard,
tallow,

1159
00:51:47,271 --> 00:51:48,104
things like that.

1160
00:51:48,940 --> 00:51:52,450
My coffee right now it's got and mct oil
and,

1161
00:51:52,510 --> 00:51:53,343
and college unit it,
it doesn't really taste like coffee 

1162
00:51:54,761 --> 00:51:55,810
anymore,
but it's not bad.

1163
00:51:55,900 --> 00:51:59,260
College is awesome.
I did a great article deep dive into the

1164
00:51:59,261 --> 00:52:01,600
health benefits of Collagen on my 
website.

1165
00:52:02,080 --> 00:52:04,270
I'm an MCT.
Oil is great.

1166
00:52:04,790 --> 00:52:06,370
Uh,
I don't know

1167
00:52:06,540 --> 00:52:08,400
really seeing people that have no idea.
MCT Oil,

1168
00:52:08,401 --> 00:52:11,220
it's like an extract of coconut oil is.
Yes.

1169
00:52:11,280 --> 00:52:12,090
Fair enough.
Yeah.

1170
00:52:12,090 --> 00:52:15,570
So mct oil is digested differently than 
other fats.

1171
00:52:15,600 --> 00:52:19,260
It basically goes straight to the liver 
and it becomes converted to Ketones,

1172
00:52:19,261 --> 00:52:20,094
which are a sort of alternate fuel that 
the brain will readily use when they're 

1173
00:52:22,891 --> 00:52:24,210
available.
And um,

1174
00:52:24,690 --> 00:52:28,990
there's some really interesting research
on mct as a potential intervention for,

1175
00:52:29,090 --> 00:52:31,830
for patients with Alzheimer's disease.
Um,

1176
00:52:32,100 --> 00:52:32,933
it might theoretically help people sort 
of wean themselves off of carbs a by 

1177
00:52:35,941 --> 00:52:38,610
sort of supplementing brain energy.
Um,

1178
00:52:39,450 --> 00:52:40,590
and yeah,
it could also,

1179
00:52:40,591 --> 00:52:43,650
you know,
I think just in terms of making you feel

1180
00:52:43,651 --> 00:52:45,210
like you've had something,
um,

1181
00:52:45,390 --> 00:52:46,223
first thing in the morning slowing the 
release of caffeine into your 

1182
00:52:47,911 --> 00:52:49,140
bloodstream.
No,

1183
00:52:49,141 --> 00:52:50,610
that's great.
Um,

1184
00:52:50,910 --> 00:52:51,743
but again,
you want to be careful with the added 

1185
00:52:52,201 --> 00:52:54,960
fats because they're very,
they're not nutrient dense and if you're

1186
00:52:54,961 --> 00:52:55,794
trying to lose weight,
there's no need to add a ton of oils to 

1187
00:52:58,171 --> 00:52:58,560
your diet.

1188
00:52:58,560 --> 00:53:00,540
I think that's the irony of where I'm at
with this thing,

1189
00:53:00,541 --> 00:53:01,374
not to make this somehow actually have 
lost a couple pounds while doing this 

1190
00:53:05,011 --> 00:53:06,960
very high fat thing.
But I hear what you're saying,

1191
00:53:07,140 --> 00:53:07,973
I actually probably could cut down on 
that and then my body will go to the 

1192
00:53:10,381 --> 00:53:12,360
actual instead of the fat and putting in
there

1193
00:53:12,510 --> 00:53:13,343
and I don't wanna break it to you,
but the weight that you lost could be 

1194
00:53:14,821 --> 00:53:17,130
water at the same time.
So yeah,

1195
00:53:17,131 --> 00:53:19,160
adding,
adding oils to the,

1196
00:53:19,490 --> 00:53:21,690
to break that to me,
I mean this is what you do.

1197
00:53:24,200 --> 00:53:25,033
Okay.
So you have,

1198
00:53:25,350 --> 00:53:26,130
you have basically

1199
00:53:26,130 --> 00:53:26,963
an Omelet,
something to that effect in the morning 

1200
00:53:28,590 --> 00:53:31,200
with some Greens in there or yogurt,
full fat yogurt,

1201
00:53:31,201 --> 00:53:33,130
Grass Fed yogurt.
Um,

1202
00:53:33,180 --> 00:53:35,760
you know,
that's something that I think is great.

1203
00:53:36,030 --> 00:53:37,860
Can you explain why grass fed is so 
important?

1204
00:53:37,861 --> 00:53:38,694
Because I feel like there's a certain 
set of people that are always kind of 

1205
00:53:40,371 --> 00:53:41,100
like,
you know,

1206
00:53:41,100 --> 00:53:41,933
you go to get grayed out,
you brass bed like that doesn't do 

1207
00:53:44,161 --> 00:53:45,660
anything.
It's no it.

1208
00:53:45,680 --> 00:53:47,880
Well it dictates the healthiness of the 
fat,

1209
00:53:47,910 --> 00:53:48,743
you know.
So if you're talking about like grass 

1210
00:53:50,021 --> 00:53:50,854
fed whey protein for example,
makes much less of a difference because 

1211
00:53:53,761 --> 00:53:57,300
whey protein is just pure protein.
But if you're talking about,

1212
00:53:57,301 --> 00:53:59,010
you know,
a piece of red meat or something,

1213
00:53:59,180 --> 00:54:02,820
grass fed red meat compared to grain fed
red meat,

1214
00:54:02,850 --> 00:54:05,250
it's a different animal even though it's
the same animal.

1215
00:54:05,490 --> 00:54:08,880
It's basically one in grass fed red 
meat.

1216
00:54:08,880 --> 00:54:09,713
You have a ratio of Omega six fats to 
Omega three fats that basically mirrors 

1217
00:54:13,651 --> 00:54:16,890
that of the human brain.
You've got a lot more carotinoids,

1218
00:54:17,130 --> 00:54:17,963
which are basically these fat soluble 
antioxidant compounds that have been 

1219
00:54:21,121 --> 00:54:23,280
shown to boost processing speed in the 
brain,

1220
00:54:23,730 --> 00:54:27,450
which is really important.
Cows that eat grass grass contains these

1221
00:54:27,451 --> 00:54:30,000
carotenoids carotinoids which are fat 
soluble.

1222
00:54:30,001 --> 00:54:31,890
They become embedded in the fat of the 
cow.

1223
00:54:32,130 --> 00:54:34,830
And so when you eat a piece of steak 
from a cow that's been grass fed,

1224
00:54:34,831 --> 00:54:35,664
you're eating those carotinoids along 
with fat that helps you absorb it 

1225
00:54:38,820 --> 00:54:40,710
because they need fat to be absorbed.
So I mean,

1226
00:54:41,040 --> 00:54:43,710
it's a really healthy food when,
you know,

1227
00:54:43,711 --> 00:54:47,610
when we're talking about grass fed meat.
And then in terms of Yogurt,

1228
00:54:47,870 --> 00:54:50,670
grass fed yogurt,
full fat can have,

1229
00:54:51,120 --> 00:54:52,460
you know,
a few Omega threes.

1230
00:54:52,470 --> 00:54:54,840
It's not a major source,
but it's got Cla,

1231
00:54:55,050 --> 00:54:57,110
vitaminK ,
two M,

1232
00:54:57,480 --> 00:54:58,313
much higher in grass fed,
in the fat of grass Fed Full Fat Yogurt 

1233
00:55:01,110 --> 00:55:03,510
Than Conventional Yogurt.

1234
00:55:03,990 --> 00:55:07,470
I feel like lunch is the hard one for a 
lot of people at work.

1235
00:55:07,620 --> 00:55:10,590
A lot of people are barely leaving their
desks at work.

1236
00:55:10,620 --> 00:55:14,460
Even for me working from home even,
but I'm so busy during the day,

1237
00:55:14,461 --> 00:55:14,970
it's like,
oh,

1238
00:55:14,970 --> 00:55:18,480
we just got to grab something or get 
chipotle a or whatever it is.

1239
00:55:18,810 --> 00:55:21,130
What,
what can you do in the mid day?

1240
00:55:21,390 --> 00:55:23,820
You can have a relatively healthy meal 
at chipotle.

1241
00:55:24,030 --> 00:55:25,260
Chipotle is still,
you know,

1242
00:55:25,261 --> 00:55:28,560
I think in all of their options has 
uses,

1243
00:55:28,610 --> 00:55:30,260
you know,
one of those oils,

1244
00:55:30,261 --> 00:55:32,250
you know,
green and probably canola oil.

1245
00:55:32,820 --> 00:55:34,860
I'm not,
I'm not sure which.

1246
00:55:34,890 --> 00:55:37,380
But yeah,
I mean you can get guacamole there,

1247
00:55:37,381 --> 00:55:39,100
which is certainly very healthy.
Um,

1248
00:55:39,160 --> 00:55:42,600
avocado is incredible for you.
It's again packed with carotinoids.

1249
00:55:42,930 --> 00:55:45,450
I'm on.
Avocado has twice the potassium,

1250
00:55:45,451 --> 00:55:46,770
have a banana,
which is amazing.

1251
00:55:46,771 --> 00:55:48,990
People think about potassium.
They only think about bananas.

1252
00:55:49,710 --> 00:55:50,543
I'm very low carb food.
You can get some protein a and then the 

1253
00:55:54,391 --> 00:55:55,950
salsa I think is fine,
you know,

1254
00:55:55,951 --> 00:55:58,380
so you can.
And the bell peppers are great.

1255
00:55:58,920 --> 00:55:59,753
Um,
but generally what I tell people for 

1256
00:56:00,901 --> 00:56:01,734
launches,
it's a great opportunity during the day 

1257
00:56:02,851 --> 00:56:03,684
to eat a salad.
I think people should be eating a large 

1258
00:56:06,120 --> 00:56:08,140
salad every single day.
Uh,

1259
00:56:08,280 --> 00:56:09,113
again,
the research is pretty compelling and 

1260
00:56:10,930 --> 00:56:13,650
you know,
mechanistically it makes sense that dark

1261
00:56:13,651 --> 00:56:15,480
leafy Greens would be really good for a 
person.

1262
00:56:16,380 --> 00:56:18,420
They are the most nutrient dense foods.
There are,

1263
00:56:18,421 --> 00:56:20,970
meaning there's tons of nutrients for 
very few calories.

1264
00:56:21,270 --> 00:56:23,740
They're packed with dietary fiber,
you know,

1265
00:56:23,741 --> 00:56:24,574
will not only help fill you up,
but it feeds the microorganisms that 

1266
00:56:27,371 --> 00:56:29,470
live in your large intestine.
This is called the microbiome,

1267
00:56:29,471 --> 00:56:32,320
which is a really exciting focus now in 
research.

1268
00:56:33,010 --> 00:56:33,843
Um,
and you want to make that solid fat and 

1269
00:56:35,951 --> 00:56:37,000
I don't mean by putting,
you know,

1270
00:56:37,090 --> 00:56:39,310
tortilla strips and ranch dressing and 
cheese on it,

1271
00:56:39,650 --> 00:56:41,260
uh,
or even commercial salad dressings.

1272
00:56:41,260 --> 00:56:42,093
You really want to avoid those.
But there was no better vehicle for 

1273
00:56:44,950 --> 00:56:48,670
extra virgin olive oil,
then a salad and extra virgin olive oil.

1274
00:56:49,300 --> 00:56:51,250
Going back to the Mediterranean dietary 
pattern,

1275
00:56:51,251 --> 00:56:53,530
it's a hallmark and they've done 
research,

1276
00:56:53,710 --> 00:56:54,543
randomized controlled trials where they 
look specifically at extra virgin olive 

1277
00:56:57,731 --> 00:56:59,110
oil.
One of the,

1278
00:56:59,140 --> 00:56:59,973
you know,
the sort of best studies to look at was 

1279
00:57:04,120 --> 00:57:04,953
done out of Barcelona,
Spain called the pre med study where 

1280
00:57:06,521 --> 00:57:09,550
they gave subjects a leader of extra 
virgin olive oil,

1281
00:57:09,820 --> 00:57:12,700
extra virgin olive oil to consume per 
week and they found that,

1282
00:57:13,270 --> 00:57:15,100
you know,
at the end of the trial,

1283
00:57:15,101 --> 00:57:17,980
went on for six years,
they had improved cognitive function,

1284
00:57:17,981 --> 00:57:18,814
they had improved risk factors for 
cardiovascular disease and they even 

1285
00:57:21,071 --> 00:57:23,590
lost weight.
So by adding more fat to their diet,

1286
00:57:23,770 --> 00:57:26,410
they ended up losing weight.
Although it was extra virgin olive oil,

1287
00:57:26,411 --> 00:57:27,820
it wasn't butter.
Okay.

1288
00:57:27,821 --> 00:57:30,550
So now we've had the Omelette started 
the day.

1289
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:33,220
We've had a big green leafy salad for 
lunch.

1290
00:57:33,221 --> 00:57:35,920
Maybe some protein in there.
What's happening in for dinner.

1291
00:57:36,360 --> 00:57:37,390
Yeah.
So for dinner,

1292
00:57:37,391 --> 00:57:38,224
I'm a big fan of grass fed red meat.
I think that's one of the more 

1293
00:57:42,101 --> 00:57:45,940
controversial tips that I give people 
because meat has sort of been in the dog

1294
00:57:45,941 --> 00:57:46,774
house for so long,
but I thought one day a week or red 

1295
00:57:49,481 --> 00:57:50,261
meat.
No,

1296
00:57:50,261 --> 00:57:51,280
I mean,
the thing is I don't.

1297
00:57:51,281 --> 00:57:52,540
There's no,
you know,

1298
00:57:52,930 --> 00:57:53,763
there was a really great study performed
by Charlotte Newman at Ucla where they 

1299
00:57:56,411 --> 00:57:57,244
gave a.
It was again a randomized controlled 

1300
00:57:59,291 --> 00:58:01,150
trial.
They gave children in Kenya,

1301
00:58:01,600 --> 00:58:06,430
um,
this a traditional porridge dish made of

1302
00:58:06,490 --> 00:58:08,890
beans and green beans and things like 
that.

1303
00:58:09,370 --> 00:58:11,320
Um,
you know,

1304
00:58:11,520 --> 00:58:14,080
what a control group had just the sort 
of vegetarian version.

1305
00:58:14,081 --> 00:58:15,310
Then they gave a group,
uh,

1306
00:58:16,210 --> 00:58:17,043
the,
a version with dairy and then they gave 

1307
00:58:18,701 --> 00:58:22,030
a group a version with meat and they 
found that the kids that were given,

1308
00:58:22,350 --> 00:58:25,000
uh,
the version with supplemented meat added

1309
00:58:25,001 --> 00:58:25,834
meet actually at the end of the trial,
had improved cognitive function and 

1310
00:58:28,990 --> 00:58:30,100
signs of mental health.

1311
00:58:30,100 --> 00:58:35,100
So there's other research actually from 
a that I site engineers,

1312
00:58:36,131 --> 00:58:38,200
foods from Australia,
Deacon University,

1313
00:58:38,201 --> 00:58:43,201
where they found that women who didn't 
consume the nationally recommended three

1314
00:58:43,511 --> 00:58:44,344
to four servings of red meat per week 
actually had twice the risk for 

1315
00:58:47,560 --> 00:58:50,860
depression or anxiety or mood disorder.
Um,

1316
00:58:51,250 --> 00:58:51,941
and so,
you know,

1317
00:58:51,941 --> 00:58:53,050
I think it's,
there's a,

1318
00:58:53,470 --> 00:58:54,303
what's called like a u shaped curve.
I think definitely some red meat is 

1319
00:58:57,311 --> 00:59:00,220
better than none,
but eating too much isn't great either.

1320
00:59:00,430 --> 00:59:03,310
You definitely want to have a diet 
that's rich in vegetables,

1321
00:59:05,020 --> 00:59:06,100
dark leafy Greens,
Kale,

1322
00:59:06,101 --> 00:59:07,120
spinach,
things like that.

1323
00:59:07,121 --> 00:59:10,870
But in that context,
I think that eating properly raised meat

1324
00:59:10,871 --> 00:59:14,830
is definitely a definitely healthy fatty
fish for dinner would be another,

1325
00:59:14,831 --> 00:59:15,664
another option,
fishes packed with micronutrients that 

1326
00:59:18,221 --> 00:59:21,590
the brain needs to create new cells,
which we now know the adult brain can do

1327
00:59:21,591 --> 00:59:23,420
up until death.
Um,

1328
00:59:24,620 --> 00:59:26,480
and uh,
yeah,

1329
00:59:26,630 --> 00:59:27,171
I mean,
uh,

1330
00:59:27,171 --> 00:59:28,004
you know,
there's,

1331
00:59:28,330 --> 00:59:29,180
there's a lot of options.

1332
00:59:29,180 --> 00:59:30,080
I think,
you know,

1333
00:59:30,590 --> 00:59:33,320
when you look at a plate,
you want to have half of it,

1334
00:59:33,350 --> 00:59:36,890
vegetables and half of it and meet.
I don't think eating,

1335
00:59:37,490 --> 00:59:40,670
one of the,
I think incorrect interpretations of the

1336
00:59:40,670 --> 00:59:42,800
Paleo Diet is that it's meant to be a 
really high meat diet.

1337
00:59:43,210 --> 00:59:44,043
Um,
I think that ignores a lot of the 

1338
00:59:45,231 --> 00:59:47,540
research now again,
surrounding the microbiome,

1339
00:59:47,541 --> 00:59:50,240
which is this area that's very new,
but,

1340
00:59:50,690 --> 00:59:51,860
uh,
you know,

1341
00:59:51,861 --> 00:59:54,350
we want to get a good amount of dietary 
fiber,

1342
00:59:54,380 --> 00:59:56,120
micronutrients,
which the brain needs,

1343
00:59:56,410 --> 00:59:57,243
um,
and there's no better way to do that 

1344
00:59:58,071 --> 00:59:59,570
then with,
than with veggies.

1345
00:59:59,630 --> 01:00:00,150
So

1346
01:00:00,150 --> 01:00:03,750
how often do you cheat on this stuff 
because I'm guessing a certain amount of

1347
01:00:03,751 --> 01:00:05,040
people that are watching this going,
all right,

1348
01:00:05,041 --> 01:00:08,430
this is what this guy does for a living.
He's writing books about it,

1349
01:00:08,431 --> 01:00:11,280
you know what I mean?
He has the time to prepare meals the way

1350
01:00:11,281 --> 01:00:12,280
he wants,
etc.

1351
01:00:12,290 --> 01:00:13,123
Etc.
How oftEn do you go off the deep end 

1352
01:00:15,301 --> 01:00:16,260
and,
you know,

1353
01:00:17,110 --> 01:00:19,360
I mean that on something a couple times 
a year.

1354
01:00:19,470 --> 01:00:20,310
But,
you know,

1355
01:00:20,340 --> 01:00:21,173
I think I think I'd have the cravings 
for ice cream or I don't to be totally 

1356
01:00:27,301 --> 01:00:29,910
honest and I,
I've always had a huge sweet tooth.

1357
01:00:30,510 --> 01:00:31,710
Um,
but I,

1358
01:00:31,711 --> 01:00:32,820
yeaH,
I don't really.

1359
01:00:33,150 --> 01:00:35,400
Once I made the transition to a lower 
carb diet,

1360
01:00:35,401 --> 01:00:36,810
I don't have those cravings.
In fact,

1361
01:00:36,811 --> 01:00:39,300
I can comfortably go hours without 
eating.

1362
01:00:39,310 --> 01:00:43,770
I think that's a really good subjective 
sign of metabolic resilience.

1363
01:00:44,550 --> 01:00:46,290
What about alcohol?
Where does that fit into this?

1364
01:00:46,291 --> 01:00:48,750
I know you mentioned the one glass of 
wine for a woman.

1365
01:00:48,751 --> 01:00:52,530
What are they one and a half to two 
wants to for men per day?

1366
01:00:52,590 --> 01:00:53,423
Yeah.
D is that basically align with what 

1367
01:00:54,691 --> 01:00:55,524
you're.

1368
01:00:55,800 --> 01:00:59,120
There's some researchers recommend 
consuming red wine.

1369
01:00:59,121 --> 01:00:59,954
It's part of the sort of mind diet,
which is a dietary sort of pattern that 

1370
01:01:05,691 --> 01:01:08,170
was created at rush university,
but I don't know,

1371
01:01:08,171 --> 01:01:09,004
I think,
I think it's hard to study alcohol 

1372
01:01:11,331 --> 01:01:12,164
because on the one hand it's such a 
powerful social lubricant and feeling 

1373
01:01:14,901 --> 01:01:16,900
connected to one another.
Um,

1374
01:01:16,910 --> 01:01:18,080
and of course,
you know,

1375
01:01:18,081 --> 01:01:21,530
as a solvent for stress,
I think it's really powerful.

1376
01:01:21,680 --> 01:01:23,030
Um,
and that's not to be discounted,

1377
01:01:23,031 --> 01:01:25,030
you know,
we live stressful lives and there's sort

1378
01:01:25,031 --> 01:01:27,080
of no way around that for,
for many people,

1379
01:01:27,560 --> 01:01:30,350
but ethanol is a neurotoxin and I think 
if you're,

1380
01:01:30,351 --> 01:01:33,830
if you have a way of dealing with stress
and feeling connected with,

1381
01:01:33,980 --> 01:01:35,180
you know,
with one another,

1382
01:01:35,181 --> 01:01:37,400
without it,
I think you're probably better off doing

1383
01:01:37,401 --> 01:01:38,234
that.
But I do give some tips in the book 

1384
01:01:40,761 --> 01:01:45,200
about how to make consuming alcohol as 
healthy and experiences as possible.

1385
01:01:45,201 --> 01:01:46,034
You want to avoid sugary mixers.
I think beer is one of the least 

1386
01:01:50,511 --> 01:01:51,450
healthiest,
um,

1387
01:01:51,830 --> 01:01:54,620
alcohols that you can consume.
Um,

1388
01:01:55,130 --> 01:01:56,810
you always want to follow the one for 
one rule,

1389
01:01:56,870 --> 01:01:58,760
you know,
chase every drink with a glass of water.

1390
01:01:59,150 --> 01:02:00,230
And also,
you know,

1391
01:02:00,310 --> 01:02:04,730
alcohol is a diuretic and when you pee a
lot you excrete sodium.

1392
01:02:05,370 --> 01:02:07,640
And so by replenishing those 
electrolytes,

1393
01:02:07,870 --> 01:02:08,950
uh,
you know,

1394
01:02:09,110 --> 01:02:10,880
while you were drinking,
I think that's really important.

1395
01:02:10,881 --> 01:02:12,890
So sprinkle a little,
a little bit of salt in your water,

1396
01:02:12,891 --> 01:02:14,180
for example.
It could Be one way to do that,

1397
01:02:14,240 --> 01:02:15,680
right?
People don't realize that like you don't

1398
01:02:15,681 --> 01:02:16,514
need down a gatorade just because he 
lost a couple of electrolytes was 

1399
01:02:18,361 --> 01:02:19,540
literally just a little salt in your

1400
01:02:19,630 --> 01:02:20,560
water.
A little bit of salt.

1401
01:02:20,610 --> 01:02:22,110
Yeah.
Um,

1402
01:02:22,330 --> 01:02:24,700
I actually became,
I've become really interested in salt.

1403
01:02:24,790 --> 01:02:25,623
I,
uh,

1404
01:02:26,020 --> 01:02:26,540
yeah.
I can.

1405
01:02:26,540 --> 01:02:27,373
I carry a little vial of salt in my gym 
bag now and after a good sauna session 

1406
01:02:30,311 --> 01:02:32,830
or workout,
I sprinkle a little bit in my mouth,

1407
01:02:32,990 --> 01:02:33,880
huh?
Yeah.

1408
01:02:34,480 --> 01:02:35,500
Yeah.
Because you lose,

1409
01:02:35,530 --> 01:02:36,230
you lose.

1410
01:02:36,230 --> 01:02:37,130
People are not going to be happy.

1411
01:02:37,140 --> 01:02:38,570
They're not gonna.
Be happy about that.

1412
01:02:38,600 --> 01:02:39,433
You lose,
especially when you're on a low carb 

1413
01:02:40,821 --> 01:02:42,470
diet.
When you drop the carbs,

1414
01:02:42,740 --> 01:02:46,240
your Insulin comes down and insulin 
basically tells the kidneys to hold onto

1415
01:02:46,250 --> 01:02:48,200
sodium.
know unnaturally.

1416
01:02:48,530 --> 01:02:50,480
So for people that are on a really hIgh 
carb diet,

1417
01:02:50,481 --> 01:02:51,314
which most most americans are consuming 
300 grams of carbs a day with insulin 

1418
01:02:54,291 --> 01:02:57,620
levels constantly elevated.
They're holding onto excess sodium.

1419
01:02:57,860 --> 01:02:58,693
So the recommendation to watch your 
sodium intake In that sort of context 

1420
01:03:02,901 --> 01:03:05,360
makes a lot of sense.
But if you're eating a low carb diet,

1421
01:03:05,990 --> 01:03:08,810
as you should focus on whole foods that 
are not,

1422
01:03:09,140 --> 01:03:10,700
um,
packed with starch,

1423
01:03:11,540 --> 01:03:14,840
you really need to be mindful of not 
only your sodium intake because again,

1424
01:03:14,850 --> 01:03:17,780
sodium sodium's a nutrient.
It's not this poison that,

1425
01:03:17,810 --> 01:03:18,643
you know,
you would think it was looking at the 

1426
01:03:20,181 --> 01:03:21,440
labels of,
of,

1427
01:03:21,530 --> 01:03:22,363
you know,
processed foods that are low in sodium 

1428
01:03:24,171 --> 01:03:26,480
and that's somehow supposed to make it 
okay that you're eating,

1429
01:03:26,930 --> 01:03:29,630
you know,
tons of sugar and processed wheat.

1430
01:03:30,380 --> 01:03:31,880
Um,
yeah.

1431
01:03:31,881 --> 01:03:33,140
So you need to really be mindful of 
that.

1432
01:03:33,141 --> 01:03:34,820
And then you do other things in your 
lifestyle that,

1433
01:03:34,821 --> 01:03:37,190
that accelerate the,
um,

1434
01:03:37,730 --> 01:03:39,740
the spilling of sodium.
So like exercise,

1435
01:03:39,741 --> 01:03:40,574
drinking coffee,
which causes you to pee out a lot of 

1436
01:03:41,811 --> 01:03:42,644
sodium.
I did a great interview with a 

1437
01:03:45,291 --> 01:03:47,600
researcher who focuses on this topic and
uh,

1438
01:03:48,140 --> 01:03:48,681
yeah,
it's uh,

1439
01:03:48,681 --> 01:03:52,070
it's an area of interest for me and 
definitely when I,

1440
01:03:52,490 --> 01:03:53,323
when I wake up in the morning,
if I'm doing like one of my really 

1441
01:03:56,060 --> 01:03:59,090
particularly low carb phases,
I'll sprinkle,

1442
01:03:59,320 --> 01:04:00,153
you know,
a little bit of salt in my water and it 

1443
01:04:00,921 --> 01:04:01,754
makes me feel,
it gives me like a boost of energy I 

1444
01:04:03,531 --> 01:04:04,320
feel like.
Yeah.

1445
01:04:04,320 --> 01:04:05,131
Interesting.
All right,

1446
01:04:05,131 --> 01:04:08,550
so let's go full circle here.
So basically about six years ago,

1447
01:04:08,551 --> 01:04:11,660
that's when this all started and,
and your mom was diagnosed,

1448
01:04:11,661 --> 01:04:14,250
he obviously changed her life 
afterwards,

1449
01:04:14,251 --> 01:04:15,520
changed your life.
Uh,

1450
01:04:15,600 --> 01:04:18,390
where's your mom at now and how have the
things,

1451
01:04:18,391 --> 01:04:20,460
everything we've talked about,
because this last hour,

1452
01:04:20,670 --> 01:04:25,640
how have you been able to incorporate 
them into her lIfe and,

1453
01:04:25,641 --> 01:04:26,600
uh,
and see,

1454
01:04:26,630 --> 01:04:27,480
see some changes.

1455
01:04:27,680 --> 01:04:28,560
I mean,
you know,

1456
01:04:28,561 --> 01:04:30,110
I've,
I've tried,

1457
01:04:30,200 --> 01:04:32,210
especially when I moved from la back to 
New York,

1458
01:04:32,780 --> 01:04:33,613
I,
uh,

1459
01:04:33,770 --> 01:04:36,820
I really tried to take a,
you know,

1460
01:04:36,860 --> 01:04:40,070
super hands on approach for as long as I
could with my mom to change her diet and

1461
01:04:40,071 --> 01:04:42,380
certainly some,
some aspects of her diet has changed.

1462
01:04:42,381 --> 01:04:43,910
but,
uh,

1463
01:04:43,970 --> 01:04:44,803
you know,
dementia is a horrible disease and it 

1464
01:04:47,601 --> 01:04:50,600
makes it really hard on both the patient
and the caregiver,

1465
01:04:50,870 --> 01:04:52,070
uh,
to,

1466
01:04:52,640 --> 01:04:56,240
to adhere to a strict dietary 
interventions.

1467
01:04:56,260 --> 01:04:58,700
You know,
there was a study that I was that I dove

1468
01:04:58,701 --> 01:05:03,230
into recently where they put people with
alzheimer's disease,

1469
01:05:03,260 --> 01:05:06,230
both mIld to moderate alzheimer's 
disease on a ketogenic diet.

1470
01:05:06,530 --> 01:05:07,363
And they found that one of the major 
limitations of the study is that 

1471
01:05:08,931 --> 01:05:11,300
adherence is so high to,
you know,

1472
01:05:11,440 --> 01:05:13,850
to these diets and it's a major stress 
on the caregiver.

1473
01:05:13,851 --> 01:05:18,851
I'm not my mom's caregiver,
but I'm at a certain point I had to kind

1474
01:05:19,451 --> 01:05:22,240
of teach and step back,
you know,

1475
01:05:22,241 --> 01:05:23,050
so that,
you know,

1476
01:05:23,050 --> 01:05:27,460
if I am around my mom and she's craving 
something that isn't max approved,

1477
01:05:27,970 --> 01:05:29,470
it doesn't affect my relationship with 
her.

1478
01:05:29,471 --> 01:05:30,304
Because first and foremost,
I love my mom and I don't want to do 

1479
01:05:33,461 --> 01:05:36,100
anything to compromise the relationship 
or her quality of life.

1480
01:05:36,520 --> 01:05:37,353
So

1481
01:05:37,430 --> 01:05:41,120
I wonder is there any work done that 
people with dementia,

1482
01:05:41,121 --> 01:05:43,700
I can sort of remember this from my 
grandmother who had dementia and I spent

1483
01:05:43,701 --> 01:05:47,420
a lot of time with her her last few 
years that she was an incredible cook,

1484
01:05:47,421 --> 01:05:48,254
used to cook all sorts of exotic things,
but in her later years as the dementia 

1485
01:05:51,861 --> 01:05:52,694
kicked in,
she really only wanted the same few 

1486
01:05:54,650 --> 01:05:55,610
things.
Is that,

1487
01:05:55,660 --> 01:05:56,493
do you think somehow connected to like 
there's just certain things maybe that 

1488
01:05:59,390 --> 01:06:00,670
are still in the memory,
like,

1489
01:06:00,920 --> 01:06:03,560
like she really suddenly wanted to 
chicken soup all the time,

1490
01:06:03,800 --> 01:06:04,633
but I don't remember really her having 
chicken soup for many years before that 

1491
01:06:06,621 --> 01:06:08,210
she would cook these crazy meals.

1492
01:06:08,330 --> 01:06:11,360
Yeah,
I mean the only shift in food preference

1493
01:06:11,361 --> 01:06:16,361
that I'm familiar with is a shift 
towards a sweeter foods which occUrs and

1494
01:06:17,060 --> 01:06:17,893
it's thought that that happens because a
brain with alzheimer's disease is 

1495
01:06:20,621 --> 01:06:22,760
essentially being starved of it's,
you know,

1496
01:06:22,840 --> 01:06:26,510
one of its primary energy substrates,
which is glucose.

1497
01:06:26,780 --> 01:06:31,310
So there's thIs notion that alzheimer's 
disease is a form of diabetes,

1498
01:06:31,311 --> 01:06:32,144
of the brain.
It's essentially become unable to 

1499
01:06:33,111 --> 01:06:33,944
properly process glucose.
That's where ketogenic interventions 

1500
01:06:37,311 --> 01:06:38,144
have shown a lot of promise and it's 
thought that that might be really 

1501
01:06:39,861 --> 01:06:42,080
helpful for a patient with alzheimer's 
disease.

1502
01:06:42,890 --> 01:06:45,750
Um,
and one of the thIngs that,

1503
01:06:45,751 --> 01:06:48,230
that sort of strengthens that,
that notion is that they,

1504
01:06:48,260 --> 01:06:49,420
that people,
you know,

1505
01:06:49,421 --> 01:06:50,254
that that perhaps never expressed a 
preference for sweet foods or had a 

1506
01:06:53,151 --> 01:06:53,984
sweet tooth begins to crave sugar and 
it's sad that that's sort of the brain 

1507
01:06:56,721 --> 01:06:59,870
crying out for sugar as a means of 
creating energy.

1508
01:07:00,380 --> 01:07:01,213
But the irony is that those are the 
exact kinds of foods that drive 

1509
01:07:03,471 --> 01:07:04,304
inflammation and insulin resistance in 
the body and that are so detrimental to 

1510
01:07:08,601 --> 01:07:09,440
the brain to begin with.

1511
01:07:11,600 --> 01:07:13,880
There's really,
there's really interesting,

1512
01:07:13,910 --> 01:07:16,370
yOu know,
and ketogenic diets are a,

1513
01:07:16,371 --> 01:07:20,030
I think they've become a little 
buzzworthy these days and popular,

1514
01:07:20,031 --> 01:07:22,850
but there's a lot of good research on 
them.

1515
01:07:22,851 --> 01:07:23,684
they're hard to study.
There's not a lot of money to go around 

1516
01:07:25,251 --> 01:07:26,270
to,
to really,

1517
01:07:26,790 --> 01:07:28,940
um,
to study them.

1518
01:07:29,660 --> 01:07:32,300
But there's good evidence that actually 
one of my friends,

1519
01:07:32,360 --> 01:07:33,193
uh,
published a study on patients with mild 

1520
01:07:34,461 --> 01:07:35,294
cognitive impairment where putting 
patients with mild cognitive impairment 

1521
01:07:39,261 --> 01:07:40,094
on a ketogenic diet seem to improve 
cognitive function and then just 

1522
01:07:42,681 --> 01:07:45,530
recently that was extended to patients 
with alzheimer's disease,

1523
01:07:45,531 --> 01:07:46,364
which we were all waiting for.
We're all waiting for a ketogenic trial 

1524
01:07:48,681 --> 01:07:52,130
to be performed on patients with 
diagnosed alzheimer's disease.

1525
01:07:52,131 --> 01:07:55,850
And it seemed that for the patients that
were able to adhere to it,

1526
01:07:56,180 --> 01:07:57,013
there was a sIgnificant improvement in 
their cognitive function when they were 

1527
01:08:00,081 --> 01:08:00,914
on that diet.
And they went back to their baseline 

1528
01:08:03,231 --> 01:08:05,210
level of cognitive function after the 
trial ended,

1529
01:08:05,211 --> 01:08:06,044
which really strengthens the notion that
ketones were helping the brain sort of 

1530
01:08:10,821 --> 01:08:12,090
as an energetic life raft.

1531
01:08:12,260 --> 01:08:13,093
It seems that the main takeaway here is 
do some of the preventional work 

1532
01:08:16,580 --> 01:08:17,600
completely.
Again,

1533
01:08:17,930 --> 01:08:18,763
you know,
alzheimer's disease begins in the brain 

1534
01:08:19,461 --> 01:08:21,440
30 to 40 years before the first 
symptoms,

1535
01:08:21,910 --> 01:08:23,090
uh,
before the first symptom.

1536
01:08:23,091 --> 01:08:23,924
And there's even some data suggesting 
that this could be a lifelong thing for 

1537
01:08:26,931 --> 01:08:30,980
people with certain genes that put them 
at higher risk for alzheimer's disease.

1538
01:08:30,981 --> 01:08:33,710
Like the apoe e four allele,
which one in four people carry?

1539
01:08:33,890 --> 01:08:35,030
Yeah.
Uh,

1540
01:08:35,060 --> 01:08:35,893
well it's a pleasure to see you.
You become a master of your craft and I 

1541
01:08:38,091 --> 01:08:40,370
think it maybe has a little something to
do with what you're eating.

1542
01:08:41,040 --> 01:08:41,840
I mean,
you're,

1543
01:08:41,840 --> 01:08:43,550
you're pulling information pretty 
quickly.

1544
01:08:43,551 --> 01:08:46,520
So I think you've,
the proof is in the,

1545
01:08:46,610 --> 01:08:47,443
uh,
gluten free pudding or something like 

1546
01:08:49,461 --> 01:08:51,890
that.
GenIus foods comes out March 20th.

1547
01:08:52,160 --> 01:08:52,993
Yes.
See,

1548
01:08:53,010 --> 01:08:54,710
I memorized that.
That was pretty impressive.

1549
01:08:54,890 --> 01:08:57,410
And that brad had your documentary 
that's in the works right now.

1550
01:08:57,470 --> 01:08:58,303
That's in the works.
That'll come out at some point this 

1551
01:09:00,320 --> 01:09:01,360
year.
Um,

1552
01:09:01,640 --> 01:09:05,330
people can check out a kickstarter 
teaser@breadheadmovie.com.

1553
01:09:05,510 --> 01:09:07,700
We'll link to that right down below.
And genius foods is,

1556
01:09:11,001 --> 01:09:11,840
So thank you.
All right,

1557
01:09:11,841 --> 01:09:12,740
well,
it's been a pleasure.

1558
01:09:12,741 --> 01:09:13,574
I think doing this with you while I'm in
the midst of this diet and you've given 

1559
01:09:16,641 --> 01:09:19,730
me some ways that maybe I can change it 
a little less fat and uh,

1560
01:09:19,731 --> 01:09:20,564
we'll,
we'll revIsit this privately and a 

1561
01:09:21,801 --> 01:09:24,140
couple of weeks and then,
and then we'll do this again for sure.

1562
01:09:24,230 --> 01:09:24,980
Awesome.
Thanks.

1563
01:09:24,980 --> 01:09:27,410
Well for max,
