1
00:00:05,130 --> 00:00:05,963
In America,
we tend to think that the news is all 

2
00:00:07,321 --> 00:00:09,720
about us all the time.
At some level,

3
00:00:09,721 --> 00:00:10,554
you really can't blame us though.
Just turn on CNN or Fox News or Msnbc 

4
00:00:14,041 --> 00:00:14,874
and all you get these days is endless 
election coverage with like a tiny bit 

5
00:00:18,901 --> 00:00:23,160
of national news and maybe a minute,
an hour on the international front.

6
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:26,400
Occasionally when something big flairs 
up the talking heads,

7
00:00:26,401 --> 00:00:29,730
we'll focus on Syria or North Korea or 
Iran for a couple days,

8
00:00:30,060 --> 00:00:32,340
but then it's quickly back to the usual 
grind.

9
00:00:32,370 --> 00:00:35,190
Even when something huge like brexit is 
happening.

10
00:00:35,191 --> 00:00:39,780
We barely talk about it in the u s until
the very last second when suddenly every

11
00:00:39,781 --> 00:00:40,614
pundit who hasn't mentioned it once in 
the past year is supposedly an expert 

12
00:00:44,670 --> 00:00:45,503
beyond hearing about terror attacks,
we barely even talk about the countries 

13
00:00:48,541 --> 00:00:49,374
we have the most in common with.
Once the initial response to the attack 

14
00:00:52,501 --> 00:00:53,334
is over,
has anything happened in the UK since 

15
00:00:55,381 --> 00:00:56,190
brexit?

16
00:00:56,190 --> 00:00:58,830
What's been happening in France since 
the Paris attacks?

17
00:00:58,860 --> 00:01:02,580
How are the toppest in Spain or the 
pasta in Italy or the cheese in Denmark?

18
00:01:02,940 --> 00:01:03,773
You might know and I might know,
but I bet it's from alternative news 

19
00:01:06,091 --> 00:01:09,750
sources and social media and not from 
mainstream television.

20
00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:11,573
The danger of only hearing about other 
countries when bad things happen like 

21
00:01:14,641 --> 00:01:16,650
terror attacks,
riots and scandals,

22
00:01:16,651 --> 00:01:17,484
is that you begin to think that's all 
that there is to these other places as 

23
00:01:21,061 --> 00:01:23,460
well as the citizens that live there 
themselves.

24
00:01:23,910 --> 00:01:24,743
Imagine if other countries only 
associated Americans with our current 

25
00:01:27,931 --> 00:01:29,790
election,
many already do,

26
00:01:29,791 --> 00:01:30,624
and that is pretty Shitty,
although possibly warranted every 

27
00:01:33,511 --> 00:01:36,660
country on earth.
Every single one has elements in it that

28
00:01:36,661 --> 00:01:37,494
are good and that are bad.
This doesn't mean that every country or 

29
00:01:40,021 --> 00:01:43,320
every culture is equal.
Obviously this is not the case,

30
00:01:43,590 --> 00:01:44,423
but every country is made up of all 
sorts of people with all sorts of 

31
00:01:47,431 --> 00:01:48,264
beliefs.

32
00:01:48,300 --> 00:01:51,180
As I've said often on the show,
the ultimate minorities,

33
00:01:51,181 --> 00:01:54,390
the individual judging an entire group 
as a collective,

34
00:01:54,391 --> 00:01:58,500
we'll almost always assure you,
dismiss huge amounts of people who don't

35
00:01:58,501 --> 00:01:59,334
fit the stereotype or the narrative.
I've said this before and I'll say it 

36
00:02:01,921 --> 00:02:02,754
again and one of the things that I'm 
most proud of about the Ruben report is 

37
00:02:05,521 --> 00:02:06,354
that our audience is truly worldwide.
When we did our fan shore a couple of 

38
00:02:09,570 --> 00:02:10,403
months ago,
we got messages from people in over 60 

39
00:02:12,901 --> 00:02:13,734
countries.
We chose people based on their 

40
00:02:15,301 --> 00:02:16,134
individual attributes,
not because we expected them to 

41
00:02:18,841 --> 00:02:23,100
represent an entire nation.
While our mainstream media does a pretty

42
00:02:23,101 --> 00:02:26,580
poor job of showing that we have more in
common than what separates us,

43
00:02:26,610 --> 00:02:27,443
I find that people like you,
the ones watching this right now do an 

44
00:02:30,211 --> 00:02:31,044
incredibly good job of it.
The conversations I see you having in 

45
00:02:33,811 --> 00:02:34,644
the comments sections right here on 
twitter and on facebook or even on your 

46
00:02:37,051 --> 00:02:41,010
own youtube videos are connecting people
from all over the world.

47
00:02:41,220 --> 00:02:42,053
I see you guys constantly trying to cut 
through the nonsense and have real 

48
00:02:44,971 --> 00:02:45,804
conversations and find some common 
ground together is the only way that 

49
00:02:49,771 --> 00:02:50,604
we'll have a chance to truly be hurt.
My guest this week is Australian 

50
00:02:53,551 --> 00:02:54,384
journalist Rida Panahi.
Rita grew up in Iran in a Muslim family 

51
00:02:57,571 --> 00:03:00,850
and emigrated to Australia.
She was six years old.

52
00:03:01,150 --> 00:03:01,983
She's now a fierce defender of western 
values and spends much of her time 

53
00:03:05,110 --> 00:03:07,780
writing about the same issues I talk 
about on this show.

54
00:03:08,050 --> 00:03:08,883
We're going to talk about her childhood 
in Iran as well as her life in 

55
00:03:11,051 --> 00:03:11,884
Australia.
Is there more to that giant island 

56
00:03:14,291 --> 00:03:16,750
country than just boomerangs and 
Kangaroos?

57
00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:20,710
I suspect there might just be,
to prove my earlier point,

58
00:03:20,740 --> 00:03:21,573
when was the last time you heard 
anything in the news about Australia 

59
00:03:23,981 --> 00:03:26,920
since the terrorist attack in Sydney 
almost two years ago.

60
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:29,860
They had a nationwide election about two
months ago,

61
00:03:29,861 --> 00:03:33,370
but I think I only heard about that 
because of a random link on twitter.

62
00:03:34,090 --> 00:03:35,470
If you're watching this,
you are,

63
00:03:35,530 --> 00:03:38,800
you've already shared much of the 
mainstream nonsense,

64
00:03:38,830 --> 00:03:42,820
but our work is still cut out for us.
Let's keep talking to interesting people

65
00:03:42,821 --> 00:03:45,370
from all over the world and if you've 
got suggestions,

66
00:03:45,371 --> 00:03:46,204
well,
there's a comment section right down 

67
00:03:47,741 --> 00:03:48,574
below.

68
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:53,353
Yeah.

69
00:03:53,620 --> 00:03:54,453
Rita Pinar,
he is a journalist who was born in 

70
00:03:55,721 --> 00:03:56,554
America,
spent her first year is in Iran and has 

71
00:03:58,571 --> 00:04:00,730
lived in Australia ever since.
Rita,

72
00:04:00,731 --> 00:04:01,930
welcome to the Rubin report.

73
00:04:02,090 --> 00:04:04,550
Thank you for having me.
Greetings from Melbourne.

74
00:04:05,300 --> 00:04:08,150
Greetings from Melbourne.
Greetings from Los Angeles.

75
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:11,270
I'm going to,
I want to dive into some Australia stuff

76
00:04:11,271 --> 00:04:14,930
cause we never hear anything about 
Australia in America.

77
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:18,240
I mean nothing since Crocodile Dundee 
too.

78
00:04:18,530 --> 00:04:20,610
We haven't heard anything from you guys.
Uh,

79
00:04:20,630 --> 00:04:22,550
but let's start a little bit with your 
history.

80
00:04:22,551 --> 00:04:24,350
Cause you have a really interesting 
history.

81
00:04:24,620 --> 00:04:26,900
You were actually born in the United 
States,

82
00:04:26,901 --> 00:04:28,280
but you never lived in the United 
States.

83
00:04:28,281 --> 00:04:29,114
Correct.

84
00:04:29,230 --> 00:04:29,760
Okay.

85
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:30,541
No,
not really.

86
00:04:30,541 --> 00:04:33,720
I spent my first couple of years there.
My parents were there,

87
00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:35,190
my dad was studying,
he was,

88
00:04:35,191 --> 00:04:37,350
um,
getting his degree in Arkansas.

89
00:04:37,351 --> 00:04:39,510
So I was born in,
down in pine bluff,

90
00:04:39,511 --> 00:04:40,344
Arkansas.
And then we moved back to the ranch was 

91
00:04:42,391 --> 00:04:45,850
always the plan and then the Islamic 
revolution happened.

92
00:04:45,851 --> 00:04:47,140
So things went,
pay shaped,

93
00:04:47,420 --> 00:04:48,253
you ran quite quickly.
And we're sort of a trap now in a 

94
00:04:51,391 --> 00:04:55,140
country that was entirely different to 
before the revolution.

95
00:04:55,540 --> 00:04:58,080
Um,
and ended up in Australia.

96
00:04:58,081 --> 00:05:00,810
And I'm,
I'm really grateful to be here really.

97
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:01,753
So it's a wonderful place.
I know you guys think America is the 

98
00:05:05,281 --> 00:05:08,010
center of the world,
but I really think Australia is that the

99
00:05:08,011 --> 00:05:12,060
lucky country as we call it and in any 
body can do well in this country.

100
00:05:12,180 --> 00:05:13,013
Yeah.
And I've heard you say that in speeches 

101
00:05:14,401 --> 00:05:18,630
before that you really think Australia 
is the true place of tolerance and where

102
00:05:18,631 --> 00:05:21,780
everyone can come and make a better life
and all that sort of stuff.

103
00:05:21,781 --> 00:05:24,450
So your parents,
so they moved to,

104
00:05:24,460 --> 00:05:27,030
to the states that your,
your dad was teaching or something.

105
00:05:27,031 --> 00:05:27,864
Right.

106
00:05:28,100 --> 00:05:28,550
Okay.

107
00:05:28,550 --> 00:05:29,840
Um,
well when he was in the states,

108
00:05:29,841 --> 00:05:30,674
he was getting his degree,
so he was at university and as soon as 

109
00:05:33,620 --> 00:05:35,330
he graduated,
they moved back.

110
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:37,970
That was always the plan.
Um,

111
00:05:38,090 --> 00:05:40,900
and uh,
and then when you ran,

112
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:44,480
went to hell,
half of the Islamic Revolution,

113
00:05:44,900 --> 00:05:45,733
um,
they started looking at how they could 

114
00:05:47,631 --> 00:05:48,890
get at,
cause uh,

115
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:49,950
they,
um,

116
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:53,090
will fairly persecuted there and they,
they,

117
00:05:53,091 --> 00:05:54,800
um,
well it just wasn't safe.

118
00:05:54,801 --> 00:05:56,940
When we had family members walked up and
sending them in,

119
00:05:57,110 --> 00:05:57,943
killed it,
it was really hell on earth for our 

120
00:06:01,371 --> 00:06:02,360
family.
So we,

121
00:06:02,690 --> 00:06:03,523
um,
we're looking to leave and the plan was 

122
00:06:05,751 --> 00:06:08,160
always to come back to the states.
Um,

123
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:11,590
but my dad had a brother in Australia 
and um,

124
00:06:11,900 --> 00:06:14,360
we ended up here.
It wasn't the plan,

125
00:06:14,361 --> 00:06:15,090
but,
um,

126
00:06:15,090 --> 00:06:16,160
it was,
it was a lucky,

127
00:06:16,910 --> 00:06:17,743
lucky chance.

128
00:06:17,910 --> 00:06:18,743
Yeah.
People don't realize that before the 

129
00:06:19,891 --> 00:06:22,200
Islamic revolution.
I mean a rod was a,

130
00:06:22,260 --> 00:06:24,840
was a widely secular state and a lot of 
ways,

131
00:06:24,841 --> 00:06:25,674
much more secular than it is now.
I know you were really young when you 

132
00:06:28,141 --> 00:06:28,974
were there,
but what are your memories from being 

133
00:06:30,391 --> 00:06:31,620
five or six years old?

134
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:34,150
Look out of the feeling limited 
memories,

135
00:06:34,151 --> 00:06:35,320
but I mean,
yeah,

136
00:06:35,321 --> 00:06:39,130
it was one of the more western parts of 
the Middle East.

137
00:06:39,131 --> 00:06:41,900
You know,
you look at pictures of Tara and back in

138
00:06:42,130 --> 00:06:47,130
before the revolution and you know,
you see women in miniskirts and I,

139
00:06:47,171 --> 00:06:50,770
men and women mixing freely and women at
beaches.

140
00:06:50,771 --> 00:06:51,604
You know,
we used to live by the beach before 

141
00:06:53,050 --> 00:06:54,790
we're in Turan.
Um,

142
00:06:54,910 --> 00:06:58,720
and then things changed dramatically in,
you know,

143
00:06:58,730 --> 00:06:59,563
it really brings home just how quickly 
things can degenerate into what we see 

144
00:07:04,931 --> 00:07:05,601
now.
I mean,

145
00:07:05,601 --> 00:07:06,434
the rants progressed a little bit from 
when the revolution first happened as 

146
00:07:09,071 --> 00:07:12,490
far as its treatment of women,
but it's still pretty bloody poor.

147
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:13,631
Um,
you know,

148
00:07:13,631 --> 00:07:14,464
I remember having to go to school and 
then suddenly going from being fairly 

149
00:07:17,651 --> 00:07:22,270
carefree and not having to cover my hair
to being in an age women at five,

150
00:07:22,271 --> 00:07:23,560
six years old,
where,

151
00:07:23,830 --> 00:07:24,663
you know,
that was a time where you had to wear 

152
00:07:25,871 --> 00:07:26,620
the hijab.

153
00:07:26,620 --> 00:07:31,620
That was a requirement and it was just 
completely dehumanizing and I just loved

154
00:07:32,761 --> 00:07:33,594
it.
I liked that change even just in my 

155
00:07:35,351 --> 00:07:40,351
little life from when I was running 
around with the boys and being a regular

156
00:07:40,391 --> 00:07:45,391
kid to being expected to observe these 
moral codes,

157
00:07:45,701 --> 00:07:48,730
like making sure my hair's covered and 
behaving in a certain way.

158
00:07:49,150 --> 00:07:50,980
Um,
so even that as a,

159
00:07:51,070 --> 00:07:52,570
at a tender age,
it,

160
00:07:53,020 --> 00:07:55,120
I felt the full force of it.
Um,

161
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:58,300
always knew I was an American citizens.
So for me,

162
00:07:58,360 --> 00:08:02,170
I always identified as someone other 
than,

163
00:08:02,700 --> 00:08:03,533
um,
someone had to live the rest of their 

164
00:08:04,661 --> 00:08:08,350
life under that oppressive system.
So it was,

165
00:08:08,351 --> 00:08:09,184
um,
it was significant for me and I was 

166
00:08:10,991 --> 00:08:11,824
like,
we have one of the original anchor 

167
00:08:12,251 --> 00:08:13,390
babies.
I was like,

168
00:08:13,391 --> 00:08:14,224
I,
I can't get out one day when I made 

169
00:08:15,630 --> 00:08:17,920
team,
I'm not going to have to be here.

170
00:08:17,921 --> 00:08:20,530
So that really was a source of comfort 
to me,

171
00:08:20,531 --> 00:08:25,531
even as a very young child,
that one day I'd get out of this.

172
00:08:26,010 --> 00:08:26,843
What a fascinating time to grow up 
because it's not like people having 

173
00:08:30,581 --> 00:08:35,080
their formative years when there isn't 
change where you just were going through

174
00:08:35,290 --> 00:08:37,630
what you had to go through,
but to go from,

175
00:08:37,631 --> 00:08:42,550
even though you were very young to 
having memories of freedom and that,

176
00:08:42,580 --> 00:08:45,360
and then as,
as a five year old or whatever that you,

177
00:08:45,430 --> 00:08:49,120
you knew something was wrong with being 
forced into that kind of system.

178
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:51,060
That's it.
And you know,

179
00:08:51,061 --> 00:08:54,180
and even now that keeps them sticking to
the young girls,

180
00:08:54,181 --> 00:08:55,530
you know,
for the first years,

181
00:08:55,531 --> 00:08:56,364
they don't have to cover up and they can
run around and then they don't have 

182
00:08:58,801 --> 00:09:02,280
these obligations on them.
But when they start school,

183
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:06,060
then the hijabs have to be worn.
And you know,

184
00:09:06,061 --> 00:09:07,870
that,
uh,

185
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:11,070
know not the best things when you've got
a stinking hot day,

186
00:09:11,071 --> 00:09:13,030
nevermind that the rest of the year.
Um,

187
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:16,710
and yeah,
breaks my heart when I see that.

188
00:09:16,711 --> 00:09:20,280
When you see the kids,
that girl's been tickled out having to,

189
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:21,593
you know,
transition from just being a kid and to 

190
00:09:26,371 --> 00:09:26,971
bang,
you know,

191
00:09:26,971 --> 00:09:28,620
part of the regime.

192
00:09:28,750 --> 00:09:31,120
Yeah.
What was it like to actually get out?

193
00:09:31,121 --> 00:09:31,954
I mean,
you said your dad had a brother in 

194
00:09:32,861 --> 00:09:35,920
Australia.
I assume the regime probably didn't want

195
00:09:35,921 --> 00:09:38,500
their,
their bright young people to leave.

196
00:09:39,900 --> 00:09:41,210
No.
I know we,

197
00:09:41,211 --> 00:09:42,044
um,
we were really lucky to be accepted in 

198
00:09:43,591 --> 00:09:45,160
Australia.
My mom,

199
00:09:45,310 --> 00:09:46,410
uh,
was a midwife.

200
00:09:46,411 --> 00:09:47,244
She was actually,
she was the head midwife at a hospital 

201
00:09:49,951 --> 00:09:50,870
there that was,
um,

202
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:55,170
attended by the royal family before the 
Islamic Revolution.

203
00:09:55,450 --> 00:09:56,283
So it was a lot of pictures of her 
showing the role family around the 

204
00:09:59,791 --> 00:10:00,810
facilities.
You know,

205
00:10:00,811 --> 00:10:03,780
that was a fairly regular thing with 
that come and visit and she'd be the one

206
00:10:03,781 --> 00:10:05,190
responsible,
she was a bit of a glamor,

207
00:10:05,191 --> 00:10:06,024
glamor,
Paulson,

208
00:10:06,050 --> 00:10:06,883
you know,
look the,

209
00:10:07,570 --> 00:10:08,403
um,
so they really feared for their life 

210
00:10:10,830 --> 00:10:15,390
because there were publications and 
pictures of her with the royal family.

211
00:10:15,391 --> 00:10:16,860
And you think that might be a minor 
thing.

212
00:10:16,861 --> 00:10:18,510
People got killed for that,
you know,

213
00:10:18,570 --> 00:10:20,340
people we know,
um,

214
00:10:20,341 --> 00:10:21,210
got,
got in prison.

215
00:10:21,211 --> 00:10:22,500
So,
um,

216
00:10:22,620 --> 00:10:24,180
we were lucky to,
uh,

217
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:25,133
like I said,
the intention wasn't to stay in 

218
00:10:26,161 --> 00:10:26,994
Australia,
but we ended up staying here and a were 

219
00:10:29,401 --> 00:10:31,200
granted asylum and it was,
um,

220
00:10:31,980 --> 00:10:32,850
uh,
just,

221
00:10:32,851 --> 00:10:33,684
uh,
you know,

222
00:10:33,890 --> 00:10:36,600
forever indebted,
indebted to the country because of that,

223
00:10:36,601 --> 00:10:38,180
because he gave us a chance at a new 
life.

224
00:10:38,490 --> 00:10:40,740
Yeah.
What kind of culture shock was that?

225
00:10:40,741 --> 00:10:43,750
Like a six year old going from Iran in 
the,

226
00:10:43,751 --> 00:10:46,200
in the Middle East to,
to an island,

227
00:10:46,530 --> 00:10:47,191
uh,
with,

228
00:10:47,191 --> 00:10:48,150
you know,
people in,

229
00:10:48,151 --> 00:10:49,480
in Boardshorts,
um,

230
00:10:49,530 --> 00:10:51,000
uh,
will be boarding and all that.

231
00:10:52,060 --> 00:10:52,970
Oh,
absolutely.

232
00:10:52,971 --> 00:10:53,804
And,
and the language was a shock too 

233
00:10:54,891 --> 00:10:55,970
because,
um,

234
00:10:56,090 --> 00:10:56,923
even though I was born in the states,
I had zero English because I'd been 

235
00:11:00,531 --> 00:11:03,080
brought up in your end.
So I had like two words,

236
00:11:03,081 --> 00:11:04,340
hello.
And T,

237
00:11:04,341 --> 00:11:07,190
which is a weird combination of woods 
deny.

238
00:11:07,230 --> 00:11:09,980
So I had to learn the language very 
quickly.

239
00:11:10,220 --> 00:11:11,053
Um,
but it's such a welcoming place and 

240
00:11:14,330 --> 00:11:17,240
thankfully English is a very simple 
language for a child to learn.

241
00:11:17,241 --> 00:11:21,040
So it only took a few months and um,
and yeah,

242
00:11:21,130 --> 00:11:24,110
it is a bit of a culture shock,
but Australia is not that different that

243
00:11:24,111 --> 00:11:26,120
the,
you guys imagine any guys think they,

244
00:11:26,121 --> 00:11:28,400
we never got Kangaroos,
you know,

245
00:11:28,850 --> 00:11:30,040
just a hobby.
Yeah.

246
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:33,940
I assume you have a boomerang within 
reaching distance of you right now.

247
00:11:34,700 --> 00:11:35,301
Oh,
wise,

248
00:11:35,301 --> 00:11:37,130
I'd never leave home without a 
boomerang.

249
00:11:37,370 --> 00:11:39,290
You never know when you need it.
Yeah.

250
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:40,970
It's um,
yeah,

251
00:11:40,980 --> 00:11:43,460
it was a culture shock.
Definitely.

252
00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:44,931
You know,
you made,

253
00:11:44,931 --> 00:11:48,530
it really felt safe and very quickly you
realize,

254
00:11:48,531 --> 00:11:51,380
you know,
this is a really welcoming,

255
00:11:51,770 --> 00:11:52,670
um,
you know,

256
00:11:52,671 --> 00:11:56,260
wonderful to,
to grow up and so much opportunity.

257
00:11:56,700 --> 00:11:57,450
Yeah.
Uh,

258
00:11:57,450 --> 00:12:01,380
did you experience any discrimination or
anything like that or really was it just

259
00:12:01,381 --> 00:12:02,970
simply you were there

260
00:12:03,330 --> 00:12:06,750
30 years and I've been here now for like
over 13 years so you know,

261
00:12:06,751 --> 00:12:07,584
I have seen um,
occasional discrimination but really it 

262
00:12:10,861 --> 00:12:14,400
is minor and um,
it's been,

263
00:12:14,850 --> 00:12:15,683
um,
quite often then the discrimination I 

264
00:12:18,301 --> 00:12:19,800
say are from your,
you know,

265
00:12:19,801 --> 00:12:23,370
your bloody social justice warriors as 
opposed to be the most tolerant,

266
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:26,310
you know,
open minded people in the world.

267
00:12:26,311 --> 00:12:27,144
But if you don't conform to their idea 
of what a brown person should be saying 

268
00:12:30,961 --> 00:12:31,794
and doing and thinking then that quite 
often really vicious and beneath that 

269
00:12:37,051 --> 00:12:39,910
seem to be near of goodness is,
is a bigot.

270
00:12:40,090 --> 00:12:40,923
Um,
and I've seen that quite a lot on 

271
00:12:42,451 --> 00:12:43,284
twitter.
That's probably the most racism I've 

272
00:12:44,490 --> 00:12:48,600
ever faced has been on twitter from,
from the lunatic left.

273
00:12:49,150 --> 00:12:50,530
Right.
Because your,

274
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:54,540
because somehow you're a brown.
Do you do identify as Muslim?

275
00:12:54,610 --> 00:12:57,130
Do you consider yourself ex Muslim or do
you consider yourself Muslim?

276
00:12:57,990 --> 00:12:59,050
Cool myself,
eggs,

277
00:12:59,120 --> 00:12:59,953
x moles on my family and was one like if
you ask them what's your religion next 

278
00:13:03,521 --> 00:13:06,610
time was lump and then very,
very relaxed about it.

279
00:13:06,611 --> 00:13:09,400
They were Muslim in the way most 
Australians are Christian.

280
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:10,513
Um,
as one big difference between Australia 

281
00:13:11,741 --> 00:13:14,680
and America where a lot less religious 
than than you guys.

282
00:13:14,681 --> 00:13:16,780
And um,
and so,

283
00:13:17,140 --> 00:13:21,430
but as early as I could remember 
identified as atheist,

284
00:13:21,431 --> 00:13:23,830
I just didn't believe.
And um,

285
00:13:24,190 --> 00:13:25,023
so for me there wasn't a real big 
transition from being a Muslim to being 

286
00:13:28,121 --> 00:13:31,720
an agnostic or an atheist because I 
never was practicing,

287
00:13:31,721 --> 00:13:32,554
you know,
I don't think my parents had ever been 

288
00:13:33,131 --> 00:13:34,190
to a mosque.
Um,

289
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:35,680
right.
Certainly not me.

290
00:13:35,681 --> 00:13:37,650
So they're not at all devout.

291
00:13:37,790 --> 00:13:41,390
So That's interesting that the,
the discrimination which you faced,

292
00:13:41,391 --> 00:13:43,790
what you're describing is very little 
and mostly on twitter,

293
00:13:43,791 --> 00:13:44,624
which is not reality.
I keep trying to remind myself that 

294
00:13:46,611 --> 00:13:48,560
twitter's not reality,
but you're getting,

295
00:13:48,590 --> 00:13:53,120
you're getting the discrimination from 
the social justice crew because your not

296
00:13:53,300 --> 00:13:54,133
your,
not their type of brown person because 

297
00:13:56,301 --> 00:13:57,530
you do speak your mind.

298
00:13:58,600 --> 00:13:59,433
Absolutely.
It is extraordinary that these people 

299
00:14:01,541 --> 00:14:05,200
who supposedly spend their lives 
fighting for the,

300
00:14:05,980 --> 00:14:08,000
for the minorities,
that,

301
00:14:08,001 --> 00:14:09,730
you know,
they see as a pitcher,

302
00:14:09,731 --> 00:14:10,564
you're pressed,
even in countries like Australia and 

303
00:14:13,030 --> 00:14:13,863
when are,
he actually speaks up and has their own 

304
00:14:15,851 --> 00:14:17,170
thoughts.
They,

305
00:14:17,171 --> 00:14:19,480
and it doesn't conform to their world 
view.

306
00:14:19,540 --> 00:14:23,650
They are absolutely appalling in,
in their response,

307
00:14:24,010 --> 00:14:26,800
uh,
straight out bigotry.

308
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:29,170
Um,
and you know,

309
00:14:29,180 --> 00:14:34,180
it's like if you were sitting rice or if
you're from a minority group,

310
00:14:34,330 --> 00:14:37,240
you should only vote a certain way.
You know,

311
00:14:37,241 --> 00:14:38,074
you're not allowed the opportunity to 
think for yourself and decide for 

312
00:14:41,441 --> 00:14:42,274
yourself who,
who you're going to support or where 

313
00:14:44,081 --> 00:14:46,810
you're going to stand on certain issues.
Um,

314
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:48,110
and yeah,
like I said,

315
00:14:48,111 --> 00:14:48,944
but beneath that thin veneer of virtue,
quite often there's a really hateful 

316
00:14:53,361 --> 00:14:55,100
bigot when,
when someone is,

317
00:14:55,101 --> 00:14:55,934
um,
you know,

318
00:14:56,070 --> 00:14:56,903
identifies as a social justice warrior 
and I've got no qualms or bad mocking 

319
00:15:00,141 --> 00:15:00,974
them day and night.
I just think there are quite often hard 

320
00:15:03,471 --> 00:15:05,570
people who deserve to be called out.

321
00:15:05,790 --> 00:15:06,623
Yeah.
And you get a lot of crap for calling 

322
00:15:08,461 --> 00:15:09,660
them out,
but it doesn't stop you.

323
00:15:09,661 --> 00:15:10,650
But I agree.
Of course.

324
00:15:10,651 --> 00:15:11,484
I mean it's such a dim view of the world
that they have that we should all be 

325
00:15:13,951 --> 00:15:15,480
viewed in.
This collective is space.

326
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:16,433
But before we go all in on that stuff,
tell me a little bit about Australia 

327
00:15:19,950 --> 00:15:20,783
because boomerangs and Kangaroos and 
reverse coriolis effect in your toilet 

328
00:15:24,241 --> 00:15:25,074
aside.
I feel like nobody in the states knows 

329
00:15:27,541 --> 00:15:30,000
anything about Australia.
You're a big island.

330
00:15:30,030 --> 00:15:30,990
That's pretty much it.

331
00:15:31,730 --> 00:15:33,230
Well,
our big island,

332
00:15:33,231 --> 00:15:36,710
most of the population lives along the 
coast love desert in the middle.

333
00:15:36,790 --> 00:15:39,650
Um,
it's a really modern,

334
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:42,650
uh,
I think it's a lot like the states,

335
00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:44,730
except we're not really just,
uh,

336
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:48,020
that's one of the things we look at you 
and we don't sort of identify when we've

337
00:15:48,021 --> 00:15:53,021
had a prime minister who was an atheist 
and we had no issue with that at all.

338
00:15:53,361 --> 00:15:54,740
I mean,
she was a terrible prime minister,

339
00:15:54,741 --> 00:15:55,940
but not because she was an atheist.

340
00:15:59,090 --> 00:15:59,581
No,
no.

341
00:15:59,581 --> 00:16:01,770
That had nothing to do with it.
Um,

342
00:16:02,580 --> 00:16:04,890
we've had a lot of prime minister's 
recently.

343
00:16:04,891 --> 00:16:08,700
We've had a,
a modern history of being really stable,

344
00:16:08,701 --> 00:16:12,600
particularly politically,
but in the last six,

345
00:16:12,601 --> 00:16:13,434
seven years,
we seem to just keep knifing our prime 

346
00:16:15,571 --> 00:16:18,510
minister's was they getting elected and 
then their own party nights them.

347
00:16:18,511 --> 00:16:19,344
And then we have another one.
So that's kind of characterize the 

348
00:16:21,481 --> 00:16:22,314
politics in recent years.
And we've got a conservative government 

349
00:16:24,691 --> 00:16:25,524
at the moment,
but led by a man who many conservatives 

350
00:16:27,391 --> 00:16:30,480
don't really see as a conservative.
So it's a really interesting period.

351
00:16:30,481 --> 00:16:32,860
And he just hung on,
um,

352
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:37,580
because a lot of the conservative base 
abandoned their party and went and voted

353
00:16:37,581 --> 00:16:40,050
for minor parties.
So it's really interesting seeing what's

354
00:16:40,051 --> 00:16:44,100
happening around the world with you guys
because there does seem to be this,

355
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:46,900
uh,
uprising from,

356
00:16:47,010 --> 00:16:51,360
from conservatives where they don't 
actually think that the major parties or

357
00:16:51,361 --> 00:16:52,290
the,
the major,

358
00:16:52,490 --> 00:16:54,270
uh,
establishment,

359
00:16:54,271 --> 00:16:56,580
I guess isn't really representing their 
interests.

360
00:16:56,581 --> 00:16:57,880
And in Australia we had,
you know,

361
00:16:57,900 --> 00:17:02,900
a lot of minor parties and some of them 
describe as far right,

362
00:17:03,180 --> 00:17:06,630
um,
a lot of boats in the last election this

363
00:17:06,630 --> 00:17:06,900
year.

364
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:07,733
Yeah.
So I think Americans think that 

365
00:17:08,461 --> 00:17:09,990
everybody is like us.
Like,

366
00:17:10,020 --> 00:17:12,000
oh,
we're a two party system.

367
00:17:12,180 --> 00:17:13,013
Even though I keep saying on the show,
the constitution never says anything 

368
00:17:16,081 --> 00:17:16,914
about only having two parties.
It's just that the two parties have a 

369
00:17:18,721 --> 00:17:19,554
strangle their system.
You guys have a bunch of parties that 

370
00:17:21,451 --> 00:17:23,850
sort of trade power and,
uh,

371
00:17:23,900 --> 00:17:26,400
and it's not just two parties on top of 
everything,

372
00:17:26,401 --> 00:17:27,234
right?

373
00:17:27,330 --> 00:17:27,961
That's right.
Well,

374
00:17:27,961 --> 00:17:32,010
we've got a labor,
which is your predominant left party.

375
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:33,353
We've got at the conservatives,
which are liberal and national and they 

376
00:17:36,151 --> 00:17:36,984
are in a coalition together.
And then we've got a minor party called 

377
00:17:39,301 --> 00:17:42,270
the grains,
which they like wanting 10 votes.

378
00:17:42,271 --> 00:17:43,490
So,
um,

379
00:17:43,620 --> 00:17:45,300
in the Senate,
our Apple House,

380
00:17:45,510 --> 00:17:48,310
they have to have a presence.
But this last election,

381
00:17:48,390 --> 00:17:53,010
the minor from all we had facets,
you know,

382
00:17:53,011 --> 00:17:53,844
the,
our senate isn't the absolute dog's 

383
00:17:54,991 --> 00:17:55,824
breakfast,
you know,

384
00:17:55,860 --> 00:17:56,693
is,
it's going to be fascinating to see how 

385
00:17:58,921 --> 00:18:02,310
we can govern for the next few years 
because you've got so many months,

386
00:18:02,311 --> 00:18:03,144
so many minor parties that I have got 
their own little objection objectives 

387
00:18:07,810 --> 00:18:09,750
and you wonder how they're going to work
together,

388
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:10,680
um,
and,

389
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:13,020
and,
and a gray and passed legislation.

390
00:18:13,021 --> 00:18:14,340
So,
um,

391
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:15,000
so yeah,
we do,

392
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:18,480
we have a very different system to you.
It's a party based system.

393
00:18:18,481 --> 00:18:19,314
We don't like for a,
for a Labor prime minister we've like 

394
00:18:22,411 --> 00:18:24,630
for our representative in our local 
seat,

395
00:18:24,631 --> 00:18:27,090
so it's a little bit uh,
different.

396
00:18:27,091 --> 00:18:27,924
Um,
but though we don't directly both for 

397
00:18:30,151 --> 00:18:30,984
the prime minister,
whoever is leading them parties 

398
00:18:33,781 --> 00:18:36,240
significant obviously and know it has a 
fair,

399
00:18:37,260 --> 00:18:38,880
fair deal to do with who gets elected.

400
00:18:39,010 --> 00:18:39,990
Yeah.
So it's kind of,

401
00:18:39,991 --> 00:18:42,040
there's benefits and drawbacks to both,
right?

402
00:18:42,041 --> 00:18:43,570
Because here,

403
00:18:43,670 --> 00:18:44,870
oh,
definitely.

404
00:18:45,110 --> 00:18:46,100
Yeah,
there is.

405
00:18:46,101 --> 00:18:47,210
There is.
Um,

406
00:18:47,630 --> 00:18:48,620
and you know,
you've got,

407
00:18:48,950 --> 00:18:53,270
particularly in the Senate when you've 
got so many different parties now he can

408
00:18:53,271 --> 00:18:57,770
have the vote diluted and our senate is 
a really weird system.

409
00:18:58,100 --> 00:19:01,280
Every single stage is entitled to the 
same number of senators.

410
00:19:01,281 --> 00:19:04,640
So you might have a very populous state 
like New South Wales or Victoria,

411
00:19:05,090 --> 00:19:07,550
but we get the same number of senators 
as Tasmania,

412
00:19:07,551 --> 00:19:07,971
which is,
you know,

413
00:19:07,971 --> 00:19:11,750
I know what it is there.
So it's not a one vote,

414
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:14,560
one value.
So it's,

415
00:19:14,561 --> 00:19:15,394
it's,
it's,

416
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:16,460
it's mad.
I mean,

417
00:19:16,461 --> 00:19:17,294
I,
I'd be very much for abolishing our 

418
00:19:18,921 --> 00:19:19,754
Senate after the house because it's very
much obstructionist and 

419
00:19:22,011 --> 00:19:23,690
unrepresentative.
But,

420
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:26,510
um,
that ain't going to happen anytime soon.

421
00:19:26,511 --> 00:19:28,570
It's an argument that's been made 
decades and,

422
00:19:28,650 --> 00:19:30,170
and you know,
it's still there,

423
00:19:30,530 --> 00:19:31,260
right?

424
00:19:31,260 --> 00:19:33,330
Uh,
I'm curious it being an island,

425
00:19:33,331 --> 00:19:34,490
I mean,
being just a day,

426
00:19:34,550 --> 00:19:38,360
the fact that you guys are so big 
geographically and that you're an eye on

427
00:19:38,700 --> 00:19:42,660
how much of that actually plays into 
sorta the national eat those because you

428
00:19:42,661 --> 00:19:43,494
know,
like when we see what's going on with 

429
00:19:44,131 --> 00:19:46,950
the European Union and borders and all 
that stuff,

430
00:19:46,951 --> 00:19:49,650
these are people that are landlocked 
next to each other.

431
00:19:49,940 --> 00:19:52,080
You know,
borders and immigration are important,

432
00:19:52,081 --> 00:19:52,914
all that kind of stuff.
And you guys really have the advantage 

433
00:19:55,980 --> 00:19:57,030
of water.
I mean,

434
00:19:57,031 --> 00:19:57,864
it really is just that simple in a way.
But how much is that actually like 

435
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:04,260
affect policies and the way people think
about the rest of the world and all that

436
00:20:04,261 --> 00:20:05,094
kinds of stuff?

437
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:07,490
Oh look,
we've got oceans and yeah,

438
00:20:07,491 --> 00:20:12,290
geographically we are blessed to be 
apart from a lot of that turmoil.

439
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:16,490
But those oceans didn't stop 50,000
people coming here by boat.

440
00:20:16,740 --> 00:20:17,573
And when Labor was in government,
and we had a very strict border control 

441
00:20:21,351 --> 00:20:24,530
system under the conservative government
of,

442
00:20:24,531 --> 00:20:27,710
of John Howard,
and when labour were elected,

443
00:20:28,280 --> 00:20:30,620
they completely dismantled that because 
that's not,

444
00:20:31,190 --> 00:20:34,460
that wasn't in their thinking.
They thought it was more humane to,

445
00:20:34,790 --> 00:20:35,623
to be a little bit more tolerant.
But that tolerance led to hundreds of 

446
00:20:40,341 --> 00:20:41,174
people over 1200 people drowning when 
our borders trying to come here from 

447
00:20:45,140 --> 00:20:45,973
places like Indonesia by boat,
they went Indonesians that travel from 

448
00:20:48,791 --> 00:20:50,290
typically the Middle East.
Right.

449
00:20:50,291 --> 00:20:51,110
So there are migrant,
yeah,

450
00:20:51,110 --> 00:20:53,090
it's actually from other countries that 
use it.

451
00:20:53,260 --> 00:20:54,021
That's right.
Yeah.

452
00:20:54,021 --> 00:20:55,610
Typically economic migrants,
I'm,

453
00:20:55,630 --> 00:20:58,540
I'm sure there was some genuine refugees
amongst them,

454
00:20:58,541 --> 00:20:59,374
but the overwhelming majority you would 
describe as economic migrants and even 

455
00:21:02,981 --> 00:21:06,250
the Labor Party came to acknowledge that
and they started toughening up.

456
00:21:06,251 --> 00:21:08,680
And right now they're,
well,

457
00:21:08,740 --> 00:21:09,573
they say they back all the border 
protection policies that the 

458
00:21:13,870 --> 00:21:16,420
conservative side have and,
and you know,

459
00:21:16,470 --> 00:21:17,303
then they're not going to dismantle 
everything because it led to enormous 

460
00:21:20,381 --> 00:21:21,214
suffering,
not just the 1200 people be drowned 

461
00:21:23,830 --> 00:21:26,770
trying to get here,
women and children amongst them,

462
00:21:27,100 --> 00:21:29,710
but also all our detention centers 
field.

463
00:21:29,711 --> 00:21:30,520
You know,
we have 50,000,

464
00:21:30,520 --> 00:21:33,820
we had 50,000,
I think even more than that in detention

465
00:21:33,821 --> 00:21:34,610
centers,
you know,

466
00:21:34,610 --> 00:21:35,443
effectively locked up.
And since we've managed to take regain 

467
00:21:39,221 --> 00:21:40,054
control of our borders,
those detention centers have emptied 

468
00:21:42,041 --> 00:21:42,874
out.
There's not people drowning on the 

469
00:21:44,111 --> 00:21:45,400
border.
Um,

470
00:21:45,460 --> 00:21:47,980
and we still have a refugee program.

471
00:21:47,980 --> 00:21:51,100
We still have a humanitarian intake,
in fact increased it.

472
00:21:51,580 --> 00:21:52,413
But we select people who are waiting and
observing the rules because you know 

473
00:21:56,651 --> 00:21:57,484
what people,
there was a period where people would 

474
00:21:58,991 --> 00:22:01,870
argue that there are no cues to come 
here.

475
00:22:01,871 --> 00:22:02,330
And you know,
they're,

476
00:22:02,330 --> 00:22:05,770
these programs don't exist.
But as we know they do exist and there's

477
00:22:05,771 --> 00:22:08,350
people floundering,
waiting in camps,

478
00:22:08,710 --> 00:22:11,620
um,
who don't have the resources to hop on a

479
00:22:11,621 --> 00:22:12,454
plane to Indonesia and then pay a people
smuggler to come by boat to Australia 

480
00:22:16,210 --> 00:22:18,490
and then now priority.
So we,

481
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:20,950
uh,
ab refugee and take I think is something

482
00:22:20,951 --> 00:22:24,100
to really be really proud of because we 
are very generous with that.

483
00:22:24,520 --> 00:22:25,870
Um,
and you know,

484
00:22:25,871 --> 00:22:26,704
this isn't just simply porous borders.
This is a proper humanitarian program 

485
00:22:30,130 --> 00:22:30,963
where these people are brought here,
they even housing healthcare education 

486
00:22:34,961 --> 00:22:36,450
and you know,
help to,

487
00:22:36,460 --> 00:22:38,620
to become integrated into society.

488
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:41,050
What Rita Rita,
I thought you were supposed to be a cold

489
00:22:41,051 --> 00:22:42,160
hearted,
heartless,

490
00:22:42,161 --> 00:22:45,700
conservative who,
who wants to close borders and all that.

491
00:22:45,701 --> 00:22:49,660
But it sounds like you're actually okay 
with immigration as you are an immigrant

492
00:22:49,661 --> 00:22:51,070
yourself,
but you just want,

493
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:54,170
you just want reasonable standards to

494
00:22:54,430 --> 00:22:55,450
absolutely.
I'm willing to go.

495
00:22:56,110 --> 00:22:56,943
What would would this country 
particularly economically needs are 

496
00:22:59,771 --> 00:23:00,604
economic migrants.
They bring a great deal of wealth and 

497
00:23:03,221 --> 00:23:04,570
you know,
we're an aging nation.

498
00:23:04,571 --> 00:23:05,404
We need people to who are working age 
and come here and are productive and 

499
00:23:09,131 --> 00:23:11,710
contribute well,
our humanitarian intake,

500
00:23:11,711 --> 00:23:14,500
we've got to be honest,
it costs us a lot of money,

501
00:23:14,501 --> 00:23:16,730
but it is something I think that,
um,

502
00:23:16,870 --> 00:23:20,560
as a rich nation we're obliged to do and
I'm proud of that.

503
00:23:21,130 --> 00:23:21,963
However,
that doesn't mean that it's a free for 

504
00:23:22,961 --> 00:23:24,140
all and whoever,
you know,

505
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:27,280
I can just a break the rules,
come here and come here first.

506
00:23:27,610 --> 00:23:28,443
Also,
we've got to be mindful of where those 

507
00:23:30,761 --> 00:23:33,190
refugees are coming from because of 
late,

508
00:23:33,220 --> 00:23:35,650
there has been issues with,
uh,

509
00:23:36,370 --> 00:23:37,203
some not integrating as they should and 
as immigrants decades before them have 

510
00:23:42,941 --> 00:23:44,410
integrated.
Um,

511
00:23:44,411 --> 00:23:45,244
so there is lot of debate in this 
country about where should these 

512
00:23:48,650 --> 00:23:50,360
refugees come from,
you know,

513
00:23:50,361 --> 00:23:53,150
where do we,
do we prioritize?

514
00:23:53,150 --> 00:23:55,880
Christians are being persecuted in,
in the Middle East,

515
00:23:55,881 --> 00:23:57,610
he's eighties.
Um,

516
00:23:57,620 --> 00:24:01,790
or do we not consider religion at all?
And just bring in whoever's,

517
00:24:01,791 --> 00:24:02,600
um,
you know,

518
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:03,620
Dean,
the neediest.

519
00:24:03,910 --> 00:24:06,530
Um,
there was a poll just this week that was

520
00:24:06,770 --> 00:24:08,900
published.
Those absolutely blown people away.

521
00:24:09,050 --> 00:24:11,220
It was a,
it was a poll that was uh,

522
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:12,673
you know,
by one of the more left leaning 

523
00:24:14,601 --> 00:24:16,070
pollsters.
So you know,

524
00:24:16,090 --> 00:24:18,700
there can be no sort of accusations and 
you know,

525
00:24:18,701 --> 00:24:19,534
it was published in the Guardian says it
came in accusations of this was some 

526
00:24:22,101 --> 00:24:26,690
sort of a rogue pole too to try to 
change public sentiment.

527
00:24:26,870 --> 00:24:27,703
But he showed one in two Australians 
supports an immediate ban on Muslim 

528
00:24:31,401 --> 00:24:33,620
migration.
Now this is absolutely shocked.

529
00:24:33,830 --> 00:24:38,780
So many people who just refuse to accept
that this sort of sentiment is out there

530
00:24:38,781 --> 00:24:42,230
and it's there because people don't talk
about this issue.

531
00:24:42,231 --> 00:24:43,350
People pretend that,
you know,

532
00:24:43,410 --> 00:24:46,070
terrorism isn't happening,
that it doesn't have a religion.

533
00:24:46,071 --> 00:24:47,210
And,
and you know,

534
00:24:47,240 --> 00:24:48,980
most Australians are smarter than that 
now.

535
00:24:48,981 --> 00:24:51,320
I don't actually agree with the 
immediate ban on Muslim,

536
00:24:51,321 --> 00:24:53,510
on migration.
I'm not for that at all.

537
00:24:53,540 --> 00:24:54,373
But I can understand and,
and the pole didn't surprise me because 

538
00:24:57,710 --> 00:24:58,543
you know,
I don't think exist in this little tiny 

539
00:24:59,601 --> 00:25:00,434
echo chamber that so many of the media 
seem to existing where I just think we 

540
00:25:06,711 --> 00:25:09,620
need to talk about these things openly.
Cause when you don't,

541
00:25:10,130 --> 00:25:13,430
that's when you have sent them in life.
This rising,

542
00:25:13,431 --> 00:25:15,110
and I don't think it's particularly 
healthy.

543
00:25:15,230 --> 00:25:16,063
So isn't that the ultimate irony of,
of your position for you particularly 

544
00:25:19,701 --> 00:25:21,830
because as an immigrant from the Middle 
East,

545
00:25:21,831 --> 00:25:23,810
it's,
it's extremely personal to you.

546
00:25:24,110 --> 00:25:24,943
But for me and the people that are in 
our space that we see on twitter that 

547
00:25:27,561 --> 00:25:28,394
are talking about this stuff that aren't
doing it from a bigoted place that want 

548
00:25:32,031 --> 00:25:32,864
to help people when we can and all that,
but also what a proper bedding they've 

549
00:25:36,171 --> 00:25:39,350
put us in a,
in a really bizarre situation.

550
00:25:39,530 --> 00:25:40,363
And for you,
I mean I've seen you go on tv and I saw 

551
00:25:43,311 --> 00:25:44,144
something where you are on tv debating 
this guy and I anchor and he kept 

552
00:25:47,601 --> 00:25:50,960
implying you were saying all Muslims 
repeatedly.

553
00:25:51,160 --> 00:25:51,993
Even even though you never said it.
Well we'll link to it below so people 

554
00:25:54,561 --> 00:25:55,960
can see it.
You never said it.

555
00:25:55,961 --> 00:25:58,250
It was the,
it was the age old argument that we have

556
00:25:58,251 --> 00:26:00,170
all the time here.
And it's like,

557
00:26:00,350 --> 00:26:02,900
man,
she's from the Middle East.

558
00:26:03,020 --> 00:26:06,770
She was born to Muslim parents.
She immigrated properly.

559
00:26:06,771 --> 00:26:07,604
Now she's trying to stand up for the 
very values that this country is four 

560
00:26:11,590 --> 00:26:13,250
and they're doing this to you too.

561
00:26:14,710 --> 00:26:15,543
This bizarro alliance between the 
regressive left and Islamist is 

562
00:26:21,950 --> 00:26:23,210
prevalent every way.
You know,

563
00:26:23,211 --> 00:26:24,044
in the UK,
the US and even in Australia and it is 

564
00:26:26,241 --> 00:26:28,700
bloody seat.
It doesn't make any sense.

565
00:26:28,701 --> 00:26:32,360
The only sense it makes is that they 
share a common enemy conservatives.

566
00:26:32,780 --> 00:26:36,860
But I think you're talking about,
um,

567
00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:41,540
appearance on morning television.
I had written a piece about,

568
00:26:41,870 --> 00:26:44,220
you know,
this terror has an,

569
00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:46,380
has a religion and we've got to 
acknowledge it.

570
00:26:46,830 --> 00:26:49,290
Again,
I was at pains as we always are.

571
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:52,680
Um,
to say I'm talking about is limits until

572
00:26:52,681 --> 00:26:53,760
a little bad.
The extremist,

573
00:26:53,761 --> 00:26:55,190
I'm not talking about that in time was 
the long,

574
00:26:55,191 --> 00:26:57,330
you know,
all those qualifications were made,

575
00:26:57,331 --> 00:26:58,680
but no,
nevertheless,

576
00:26:58,740 --> 00:27:00,540
you know,
even just talking about it,

577
00:27:00,541 --> 00:27:01,374
Ebony and identifying what is happening 
that is clear to anybody who hasn't got 

578
00:27:05,521 --> 00:27:08,420
their head buried in the sand was a pour
into this dude.

579
00:27:08,610 --> 00:27:12,330
And he brought up Christian terrorism,
you know,

580
00:27:13,050 --> 00:27:15,180
bombings at abortion clinics,
which I think,

581
00:27:15,181 --> 00:27:16,014
you know,
the last one was that he could find was 

582
00:27:17,371 --> 00:27:18,960
about 15,
20 years ago.

583
00:27:18,961 --> 00:27:20,480
But nevertheless,
you know,

584
00:27:20,490 --> 00:27:25,490
you can't talk about Muslim based or 
Islam as space terror without mentioning

585
00:27:27,540 --> 00:27:28,440
the Christian.
You know,

586
00:27:28,441 --> 00:27:29,274
it's just,

587
00:27:30,280 --> 00:27:31,113
it was pretty great because you asked 
him when the last one was and he had no 

588
00:27:34,321 --> 00:27:37,680
idea that he busted out his phone in a 
few minutes later,

589
00:27:37,681 --> 00:27:39,960
came back and yeah,
it turned out to be 15 or 20 years ago.

590
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:41,370
I'm curious,
you know,

591
00:27:41,371 --> 00:27:42,204
because you guys haven't been hit with 
terrorism really until about two years 

592
00:27:46,861 --> 00:27:50,460
ago in Sydney and there was that hostage
situation and all that was,

593
00:27:50,520 --> 00:27:54,450
how much did that actually change the 
discussion for you guys because you were

594
00:27:54,451 --> 00:27:57,400
seeing it everywhere else again,
surrounded by water,

595
00:27:57,410 --> 00:27:59,570
seemingly safe.
Um,

596
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:01,950
did that really change the discussion in
the country?

597
00:28:03,130 --> 00:28:03,963
Okay.
Did the Lindt cafe siege in Sydney and 

598
00:28:07,580 --> 00:28:12,010
there's been other events?
It just a short time before that,

599
00:28:12,011 --> 00:28:14,220
there was a,
a young kitten,

600
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:16,990
Melvin,
who was radicalized and,

601
00:28:16,991 --> 00:28:17,824
uh,
he tried to kill a couple of police 

602
00:28:19,061 --> 00:28:21,580
officers,
stabbed and repeatedly he was shot dead.

603
00:28:22,570 --> 00:28:25,860
That was probably our first taste of it.
Um,

604
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:29,380
linked effected the public.
It wasn't just targeted at police,

605
00:28:29,620 --> 00:28:32,050
but we've been really fortunate in this 
country.

606
00:28:32,051 --> 00:28:34,960
We've had our counter terrorism offices,
uh,

607
00:28:34,961 --> 00:28:39,040
and authorities foil several plots.
We've just had some,

608
00:28:39,041 --> 00:28:39,940
uh,
uh,

609
00:28:39,970 --> 00:28:42,550
someone in prison for what was a called 
the Anzac Day,

610
00:28:42,551 --> 00:28:45,250
Tara Palantir.
Really significant date within our,

611
00:28:45,610 --> 00:28:46,443
within our calendar,
the plot plot there was to run over a 

612
00:28:48,611 --> 00:28:50,560
police officer,
behead them,

613
00:28:51,100 --> 00:28:54,540
take their gun and shoot more people.
Um,

614
00:28:55,630 --> 00:28:59,590
we've had a mother's Day plot that's 
with before the courts now,

615
00:28:59,591 --> 00:29:01,000
which was again,
uh,

616
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:03,760
you know,
going to be tired in the public from the

617
00:29:03,761 --> 00:29:05,230
information that's out there.

618
00:29:05,560 --> 00:29:06,610
So there's,
there's been,

619
00:29:06,611 --> 00:29:07,181
um,
and,

620
00:29:07,181 --> 00:29:10,060
and the biggest one we had was all about
a decade ago,

621
00:29:10,090 --> 00:29:11,270
if not longer.
Um,

622
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:12,400
you know,
about a decade ago,

623
00:29:12,401 --> 00:29:17,350
which was a quite advanced plans to bomb
the Melbourne cricket ground,

624
00:29:17,380 --> 00:29:19,780
which is our biggest sporting stadium 
here.

625
00:29:20,650 --> 00:29:24,580
So we've been really fortunate that 
these plots have been,

626
00:29:24,800 --> 00:29:27,250
um,
stopped in their tracks.

627
00:29:27,251 --> 00:29:30,040
But those lone wolf attacks as we call 
them,

628
00:29:30,700 --> 00:29:33,010
they're not so easily stopped.
And,

629
00:29:33,011 --> 00:29:33,844
and it has been a,
we had a police member shot in Sydney 

630
00:29:37,750 --> 00:29:39,310
last year,
um,

631
00:29:39,480 --> 00:29:41,890
in an attack by a young kid,
I think it was 15,

632
00:29:41,891 --> 00:29:43,060
16,
who was again,

633
00:29:43,061 --> 00:29:46,090
radicalized.
So we've had a taste of it,

634
00:29:46,091 --> 00:29:47,110
but no way.
Like,

635
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:48,633
yeah,
places like France and Belgium where 

636
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:51,033
there issues seem to be so advanced that
you want to have they ever going to get 

637
00:29:54,341 --> 00:29:55,080
on top of it.

638
00:29:55,080 --> 00:29:55,913
Yeah.
Is that the irony too is that it's like 

639
00:29:57,571 --> 00:30:00,300
the better that our security services 
are,

640
00:30:00,510 --> 00:30:01,343
the more things that they stop.
And often we don't know that they 

641
00:30:03,991 --> 00:30:06,630
stopped them until sometimes months or 
years later.

642
00:30:06,810 --> 00:30:09,570
And then at the same time it makes the 
threat seem lower.

643
00:30:09,810 --> 00:30:13,440
So then people want to be more tolerant.
And again,

644
00:30:13,441 --> 00:30:15,760
tolerance basically is good.
Uh,

645
00:30:15,930 --> 00:30:18,820
but you don't have a full picture.
And I guess that's really what the,

646
00:30:18,821 --> 00:30:19,710
the big issue is

647
00:30:20,860 --> 00:30:22,720
absolutely.
You can become complacent.

648
00:30:22,721 --> 00:30:25,080
I know we don't live in fear here.
We don't think you know,

649
00:30:25,081 --> 00:30:27,460
over what was going to be blowing off 
around the street corner.

650
00:30:27,461 --> 00:30:28,294
But again,
you've just got to be awake to the 

651
00:30:30,761 --> 00:30:31,594
reality of what's happening around the 
world and that we are not immune from 

652
00:30:34,361 --> 00:30:35,011
it.
You know,

653
00:30:35,011 --> 00:30:35,844
the terror denies around here we'll 
bring up things like what you got much 

654
00:30:38,231 --> 00:30:39,170
more chance of,
you know,

655
00:30:39,310 --> 00:30:41,410
dying in a car crash.
Right.

656
00:30:41,460 --> 00:30:42,680
Cool.
Bloody do you know,

657
00:30:42,730 --> 00:30:45,850
we drive around,
they got millions of cars but you know,

658
00:30:45,851 --> 00:30:46,684
do we not think about terror and we 
don't worry about that and make sure we 

659
00:30:51,401 --> 00:30:53,490
kept doing things to counter it.
Um,

660
00:30:53,890 --> 00:30:54,723
yeah.
Do we not worry about domestic violence 

661
00:30:55,940 --> 00:30:58,540
because more people are dying on the 
roads from car accidents.

662
00:30:58,541 --> 00:31:01,390
I mean,
it is just a stupid argument.

663
00:31:01,420 --> 00:31:05,910
There is just so much that is 
intellectually dishonest and,

664
00:31:06,190 --> 00:31:07,023
and just fraudulent in my mind when it 
comes to this space because people will 

665
00:31:12,550 --> 00:31:13,383
do anything not to talk about it.
People will do anything to deny that 

666
00:31:15,731 --> 00:31:16,564
it's even an issue.
And it obviously is an issue on this 

667
00:31:19,121 --> 00:31:19,954
poll that came out this week show is 
that it is an issue and people are 

668
00:31:23,851 --> 00:31:24,684
thinking about it.
Even if our elite median politicians 

669
00:31:28,050 --> 00:31:30,030
aren't willing to discuss it.

670
00:31:30,150 --> 00:31:32,550
Yeah.
Can you think of anything else that were

671
00:31:32,551 --> 00:31:33,384
so paralyzed to talk about?
Cause I really can't in 2016 is there 

672
00:31:37,441 --> 00:31:38,274
anything else that we treat with such 
kid gloves that is of such importance 

673
00:31:42,841 --> 00:31:43,674
and I,
and I get email from people literally 

674
00:31:45,421 --> 00:31:46,254
all over the world from almost every 
country saying that their governments 

675
00:31:48,691 --> 00:31:49,920
are doing the exact same thing.

676
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:52,130
Yeah.
It seems to,

677
00:31:52,190 --> 00:31:53,450
yeah.
Not Be.

678
00:31:54,260 --> 00:31:57,380
Every western nation seems to be dealing
with it in Australia.

679
00:31:57,381 --> 00:31:59,720
I think the other issue that is,
seems to be to do,

680
00:31:59,890 --> 00:32:00,723
uh,
but is a significant issue is what's 

681
00:32:02,841 --> 00:32:05,390
happening in a lot of indigenous 
communities.

682
00:32:05,420 --> 00:32:06,253
Again,
it's something that people don't talk 

683
00:32:08,121 --> 00:32:08,954
about because if you do talk about it 
and he can get labeled a racist very 

684
00:32:12,441 --> 00:32:13,274
quickly,
even though you care enough to want to 

685
00:32:16,281 --> 00:32:18,450
actually do something about an attack,
lease,

686
00:32:18,510 --> 00:32:21,440
put it on the public to public or 
discuss it.

687
00:32:21,450 --> 00:32:25,340
Even we've got kids who are being really
mistreated,

688
00:32:25,350 --> 00:32:26,270
neglected,

689
00:32:27,010 --> 00:32:27,310
okay.

690
00:32:27,310 --> 00:32:30,250
And they're not being saved by the 
authorities.

691
00:32:30,251 --> 00:32:35,200
They're not being taken into care at the
same level as you would expect.

692
00:32:35,310 --> 00:32:36,290
Uh,
I mean,

693
00:32:36,550 --> 00:32:38,260
sorry,
let me rephrase that.

694
00:32:38,440 --> 00:32:41,300
They actually are taking in to care at 
greater rates then,

695
00:32:41,620 --> 00:32:42,453
then the non indigenous community,
but at the point where the authorities 

696
00:32:47,121 --> 00:32:49,050
typed them seems to be a,
you know,

697
00:32:49,051 --> 00:32:51,370
a lot higher than then.
You know,

698
00:32:51,500 --> 00:32:56,240
no white kid I don't think would be 
allowed to be mistreated in that way for

699
00:32:56,241 --> 00:32:58,870
so long before they are saved.
And we,

700
00:32:58,871 --> 00:33:03,871
we've got this nurse stolen generation 
narrative in our history that,

701
00:33:04,950 --> 00:33:09,560
that the authorities are scared now to 
actually save kids who are being abused.

702
00:33:09,561 --> 00:33:10,394
And,
and because of that political 

703
00:33:11,811 --> 00:33:12,644
correctness,
because they don't want to create 

704
00:33:14,361 --> 00:33:15,194
another stolen generation of the 
indigenous kids taken from their 

705
00:33:18,021 --> 00:33:18,854
parents.
But those kids are condemned to just 

706
00:33:22,071 --> 00:33:23,120
terrible lives.

707
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:23,761
You know,
their,

708
00:33:23,761 --> 00:33:24,240
they're,
they're,

709
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:26,180
they repeat the cycle.
They,

710
00:33:26,470 --> 00:33:27,303
and,
and I think that's just such a great 

711
00:33:28,461 --> 00:33:31,920
shame and there is that there is a 
really significant gap in,

712
00:33:32,030 --> 00:33:35,660
in living standards in life expectancy 
in outcomes.

713
00:33:35,870 --> 00:33:36,703
Right.
Did you in this community compared to 

714
00:33:37,851 --> 00:33:38,684
the non indigenous community.
And I believe a great deal of that has 

715
00:33:41,811 --> 00:33:42,644
to do with these politically correct 
policies where we can't talk about 

716
00:33:46,671 --> 00:33:50,090
what's happening.
We can't talk about the rampant abuse,

717
00:33:50,180 --> 00:33:53,930
sexual abuse.
We can't talk about the alcoholism,

718
00:33:53,931 --> 00:33:58,780
the drug use because to,
to even start discussing it is,

719
00:33:58,781 --> 00:33:59,840
is,
is racist.

720
00:33:59,841 --> 00:34:00,674
You know,
the arguments will come up with what 

721
00:34:01,881 --> 00:34:05,390
about all the drug use and alcoholism 
and the non indigenous community?

722
00:34:05,900 --> 00:34:06,733
Well,
yes,

723
00:34:06,860 --> 00:34:08,810
of course.
But that doesn't stop.

724
00:34:08,900 --> 00:34:13,850
Yeah.
It's exactly the same sort of phenomenon

725
00:34:13,851 --> 00:34:14,684
happening there and it's just as 
destructive and it actually hurts the 

726
00:34:17,331 --> 00:34:21,140
people that they're trying to protect 
from,

727
00:34:21,200 --> 00:34:22,040
from discussion.

728
00:34:22,220 --> 00:34:23,340
Right.
And we see that,

729
00:34:23,450 --> 00:34:27,380
we see that exact same thing when it 
comes to the discussion on Islam because

730
00:34:27,381 --> 00:34:29,780
if we don't talk about it,
then who are you hurting the most?

731
00:34:29,781 --> 00:34:34,580
You're actually hurting Muslim people 
who are living under these theocracies

732
00:34:38,870 --> 00:34:39,703
killed the most and oppress the most are
other Muslims and Islamic state and 

733
00:34:44,721 --> 00:34:48,830
looks at Shiite Muslims like my family 
as infidels.

734
00:34:48,831 --> 00:34:53,120
No different from,
from Jews or a nonbelievers gays,

735
00:34:53,500 --> 00:34:54,030
you know,
they,

736
00:34:54,030 --> 00:34:56,780
they think they're deserving of nothing 
other than death as well.

737
00:34:56,781 --> 00:34:57,980
So,
um,

738
00:34:58,250 --> 00:35:02,510
and extremist Islam as have been killing
other Muslims,

739
00:35:02,620 --> 00:35:03,453
you know,
at a rate that is extraordinary for 

740
00:35:05,211 --> 00:35:06,044
decades and we just don't,
it's almost not on our radar anymore 

741
00:35:09,201 --> 00:35:10,520
because it happens so often

742
00:35:12,010 --> 00:35:13,780
about the abortion bombing in the 
Crusades.

743
00:35:14,430 --> 00:35:15,120
Well,
that's it.

744
00:35:15,120 --> 00:35:15,610
Well,
even google.

745
00:35:15,610 --> 00:35:17,070
Yeah.
What about the Crusades?

746
00:35:17,071 --> 00:35:18,450
I mean,
God's sake,

747
00:35:18,451 --> 00:35:21,290
some of the arguments that are thrown up
are just,

748
00:35:22,590 --> 00:35:23,423
they're just too stupid.
But you've got to acknowledge them when 

749
00:35:25,201 --> 00:35:29,130
you've got to counter them because 
they're being taught in universities.

750
00:35:29,131 --> 00:35:29,964
You know,
I've had these sort of arguments with 

751
00:35:30,841 --> 00:35:34,640
university lecturers and journalists and
you know,

752
00:35:34,641 --> 00:35:35,474
pay academics who are on public purse 
and I just spewing forth bullshit and 

753
00:35:41,071 --> 00:35:42,210
it's maddening.

754
00:35:43,260 --> 00:35:46,430
Spewing forth bullshit.
That could be the title of a,

755
00:35:46,431 --> 00:35:48,510
of a book that we should probably call 
write that book.

756
00:35:48,600 --> 00:35:49,433
So jumping back for a second,
talking about Australia's role in the 

757
00:35:51,901 --> 00:35:52,734
world,
what is the Australian sort of ethos 

758
00:35:55,801 --> 00:35:56,634
about what you feel your role should be?
Obviously you guys aren't that 

759
00:36:00,181 --> 00:36:01,014
interventionists,
but you've been part of coalitions and 

760
00:36:03,271 --> 00:36:04,500
things like that.
What is the,

761
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:08,190
the feeling there of what your purpose 
in the world should be?

762
00:36:09,450 --> 00:36:12,050
Well,
pretty laid back about things.

763
00:36:12,051 --> 00:36:14,150
We don't try to sort of sit the agenda 
agender or,

764
00:36:14,540 --> 00:36:15,680
um,
you know,

765
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:19,910
in four our belief systems.
But we have been a good corporates.

766
00:36:19,911 --> 00:36:22,490
The corporates,
we've been global citizen.

767
00:36:22,820 --> 00:36:23,653
Oh Man.

768
00:36:24,270 --> 00:36:26,910
Slip is going to be replayed many,
many times.

769
00:36:28,810 --> 00:36:30,040
Um,
but yeah,

770
00:36:30,041 --> 00:36:30,791
we will,
I think,

771
00:36:30,791 --> 00:36:31,500
you know,
I,

772
00:36:31,500 --> 00:36:33,310
I'm used to,
we can be quite proud of,

773
00:36:33,480 --> 00:36:35,120
um,
uh,

774
00:36:35,140 --> 00:36:37,660
involvement in World War Two,
our involvement,

775
00:36:37,750 --> 00:36:39,160
um,
uh,

776
00:36:39,220 --> 00:36:41,380
you know,
with the allied forces.

777
00:36:42,130 --> 00:36:43,540
And I think,
you know,

778
00:36:43,541 --> 00:36:45,970
we do feel a little bit removed 
geographically.

779
00:36:45,971 --> 00:36:49,090
We are so far from so much of what's 
happening around the world,

780
00:36:49,540 --> 00:36:50,920
but these days,
you know,

781
00:36:50,921 --> 00:36:53,770
it's all there in your hand and your 
phone and it's,

782
00:36:53,771 --> 00:36:54,221
it's,
it's,

783
00:36:54,221 --> 00:36:55,180
it's immediate.
You know,

784
00:36:55,181 --> 00:36:58,220
what's happening as soon as it happens,
you know,

785
00:36:58,221 --> 00:36:58,740
it's,
it's,

786
00:36:58,740 --> 00:37:00,030
uh,
uh,

787
00:37:00,090 --> 00:37:02,110
we are living in a time where,
you know,

788
00:37:02,111 --> 00:37:02,944
those,
those borders don't seem to mean as 

789
00:37:05,171 --> 00:37:06,700
much.
So I think,

790
00:37:06,701 --> 00:37:09,310
um,
we're feeling relaxed about our place in

791
00:37:09,311 --> 00:37:10,150
the world.
Uh,

792
00:37:10,151 --> 00:37:11,830
you know,
when we do have those amongst us,

793
00:37:11,831 --> 00:37:16,480
as you have been Erie community who 
wants to set the agenda,

794
00:37:16,510 --> 00:37:17,620
they want to be,
you know,

795
00:37:17,950 --> 00:37:20,410
yeah,
we had a carbon tax for a while and,

796
00:37:20,411 --> 00:37:21,940
you know,
the rationale was there.

797
00:37:21,960 --> 00:37:22,710
We,
you know,

798
00:37:22,710 --> 00:37:26,320
we got to lead the world in an emission 
trading scheme.

799
00:37:26,321 --> 00:37:31,060
We're going to be the standard bearers 
in a fighting global warming.

800
00:37:31,061 --> 00:37:31,570
And,
uh,

801
00:37:31,570 --> 00:37:33,250
the government got thrown out really 
quickly,

802
00:37:33,251 --> 00:37:37,030
so yeah,
that didn't last too long.

803
00:37:37,031 --> 00:37:42,031
So I think overall it's Australians 
recognize a pretty lucky,

804
00:37:43,030 --> 00:37:47,080
we got a very good standard of living.
We've got our own concerns.

805
00:37:47,081 --> 00:37:47,914
Um,
all sorts of issues from housing 

806
00:37:49,571 --> 00:37:54,300
affordability to uh,
the threat of terror.

807
00:37:54,680 --> 00:37:56,680
Um,
but um,

808
00:37:56,740 --> 00:37:57,491
I think we're,
yeah,

809
00:37:57,491 --> 00:37:58,660
we're pretty happy with

810
00:38:00,950 --> 00:38:02,660
saying what's happening around the world
and,

811
00:38:02,680 --> 00:38:03,513
and,
and feeling fortunate that it's not 

812
00:38:05,361 --> 00:38:07,010
happening in our back yard yet.

813
00:38:07,250 --> 00:38:07,791
Yeah,
it's,

814
00:38:07,791 --> 00:38:11,330
I'm telling you it's that water thing 
being big and surrounded by water.

815
00:38:11,331 --> 00:38:12,470
It's,
it's pretty good.

816
00:38:12,770 --> 00:38:14,250
Um,
what do,

817
00:38:14,900 --> 00:38:19,200
what do you make of our crazy election 
here at Natalie?

818
00:38:19,220 --> 00:38:20,053
What do you make of it?
But what kind of coverage in Australia 

819
00:38:21,861 --> 00:38:24,650
just in mainstream media is our election
getting?

820
00:38:24,651 --> 00:38:26,240
Cause it's all,
it's all we have here.

821
00:38:26,241 --> 00:38:28,100
Any of the Cable News,
24 hour days,

822
00:38:28,101 --> 00:38:29,210
that's all we talk about.

823
00:38:30,490 --> 00:38:30,990
Okay.

824
00:38:30,990 --> 00:38:33,990
Are we getting a lot,
a lot more than previously?

825
00:38:33,991 --> 00:38:38,991
There is a lot of American election 
coverage in our mainstream news,

826
00:38:39,191 --> 00:38:42,790
that particular television,
great deal of it and all of it.

827
00:38:42,910 --> 00:38:45,790
Almost all of it is pretty much what 
you'd expect.

828
00:38:45,791 --> 00:38:47,170
It's very much,
you know,

829
00:38:47,171 --> 00:38:51,370
trump is this maniac who's a racist and 
sexist.

830
00:38:51,371 --> 00:38:54,250
And you know,
some of the reports I've seen,

831
00:38:54,270 --> 00:38:55,440
she's wasted.
They just straight.

832
00:38:55,441 --> 00:38:57,950
And news reports have been,
again,

833
00:38:57,960 --> 00:39:00,400
an extraordinary in,
in being little,

834
00:39:00,401 --> 00:39:04,690
you know,
editorials that are absolutely biased.

835
00:39:04,691 --> 00:39:06,040
Um,
personally,

836
00:39:06,060 --> 00:39:07,660
um,
I don't know what,

837
00:39:07,661 --> 00:39:09,970
I mean,
I've got a great deal of thoughts.

838
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:13,100
I'm not a fan of either candidate.
Um,

839
00:39:13,420 --> 00:39:15,820
I can't believe it's easy astic for 
trump,

840
00:39:15,821 --> 00:39:17,830
but I completely understand the 
phenomenon.

841
00:39:17,831 --> 00:39:22,831
I understand people being utterly fed up
and wanting an antiestablishment figure.

842
00:39:24,130 --> 00:39:26,440
Um,
and I know why he appeals to people.

843
00:39:26,441 --> 00:39:27,274
I think a lot of things that the media 
sees gaps and sees huge errors in his 

844
00:39:32,351 --> 00:39:33,130
character.

845
00:39:33,130 --> 00:39:36,880
I actually enormous assets and a of what
appealed to a lot of people.

846
00:39:36,881 --> 00:39:38,220
So,
um,

847
00:39:38,590 --> 00:39:39,423
it's been just fascinating.
I would love to be there for the last 

848
00:39:42,190 --> 00:39:46,120
month or two and just say had on phones.
Um,

849
00:39:46,180 --> 00:39:46,871
but you know,
trump,

850
00:39:46,871 --> 00:39:48,730
some of his greatest enemies are,
again,

851
00:39:48,731 --> 00:39:49,750
he's great.
Assess it.

852
00:39:49,751 --> 00:39:52,260
So you look at what's happening now with
the protests in,

853
00:39:52,261 --> 00:39:55,180
in Charlotte and um,
you know,

854
00:39:55,260 --> 00:39:56,093
the,
the protests that were happening at 

855
00:39:56,541 --> 00:39:57,374
Israelis and you think the average 
American looking at that would actually 

856
00:40:02,561 --> 00:40:03,394
sympathize with,
would simply would understand some of 

857
00:40:06,311 --> 00:40:09,490
the things he's been saying about what 
the country has turned into.

858
00:40:09,850 --> 00:40:10,500
Um,
you know,

859
00:40:10,500 --> 00:40:11,333
Charlotte is just extraordinary.
You've got a black cop shooting and 

860
00:40:15,400 --> 00:40:16,233
seems to be an arm of black men and the 
places being torn apart and our black 

861
00:40:19,901 --> 00:40:21,960
protestors showed another black protests
and stuff.

862
00:40:22,390 --> 00:40:23,223
But it's

863
00:40:23,250 --> 00:40:24,990
in a city with a democratic mayor.

864
00:40:26,500 --> 00:40:27,101
Yeah.
And it,

865
00:40:27,101 --> 00:40:29,870
but it is why she's fault somehow.
You know,

866
00:40:30,060 --> 00:40:30,893
this black on black violence that's 
happened as somehow a course for just 

867
00:40:35,860 --> 00:40:36,693
lutie and beatings and just a mass 
mindless violence that's been 

868
00:40:41,201 --> 00:40:46,201
characterized as some sort of a protest 
that's got some purpose and it doesn't,

869
00:40:47,441 --> 00:40:50,020
it is just mindless looting and 
violence.

870
00:40:50,021 --> 00:40:53,320
And it should be called and what it is,
and again,

871
00:40:53,410 --> 00:40:54,243
I think the public can see what it is,
but the media narrative is trying to 

872
00:40:58,121 --> 00:41:01,120
paint it as something other than that.
And I think that is a great,

873
00:41:01,350 --> 00:41:02,183
uh,
the thing is something else we have in 

874
00:41:03,161 --> 00:41:03,994
common in Australia and America,
Europe is the media being out of touch 

875
00:41:11,441 --> 00:41:14,230
with its readers,
viewers,

876
00:41:14,290 --> 00:41:17,140
listeners,
they're just increasingly,

877
00:41:17,141 --> 00:41:22,141
there's a gap between members of the 
media and the mainstream population.

878
00:41:23,261 --> 00:41:24,580
And I think that's not healthy.

879
00:41:24,730 --> 00:41:25,563
Yeah,
I think it's interesting that you used 

880
00:41:26,201 --> 00:41:27,034
the phrase out of touch because I think 
one of the debates were constantly 

881
00:41:29,441 --> 00:41:33,560
having here and the reason that online 
shows are working is that it's it,

882
00:41:33,620 --> 00:41:38,030
is it out of touch or is it that they're
actually in it with the politicians?

883
00:41:38,031 --> 00:41:38,864
Do you think it's,
it's like a sort of generational thing 

884
00:41:41,241 --> 00:41:43,430
and just the technology thing and you 
know,

885
00:41:43,431 --> 00:41:44,264
we're all walking around with phones,
so now we're all on the ground 

886
00:41:45,890 --> 00:41:46,723
journalists or,
or is it that they're actually in it 

887
00:41:49,431 --> 00:41:50,264
with the people in power so they have a 
vested interest in keeping that game 

888
00:41:53,571 --> 00:41:54,830
going?
Or maybe both?

889
00:41:55,570 --> 00:41:58,170
Well in the U S in might be a bit of 
that.

890
00:41:58,330 --> 00:42:01,890
In Australia I think it is that,
I think it's because they're part of the

891
00:42:02,010 --> 00:42:02,843
establishment or the elite.
I think it's just the ideological 

892
00:42:06,900 --> 00:42:10,770
disposition of a great number of the 
members of the media and it's,

893
00:42:10,771 --> 00:42:13,590
it's,
it's quite many of them,

894
00:42:13,670 --> 00:42:14,940
uh,
not,

895
00:42:15,290 --> 00:42:16,170
uh,
you know,

896
00:42:16,171 --> 00:42:18,030
then look at the mainstream,
well,

897
00:42:18,031 --> 00:42:20,130
one,
they don't acknowledge the mainstream is

898
00:42:20,131 --> 00:42:21,240
actually mainstream.
No,

899
00:42:21,241 --> 00:42:22,074
they think quite often things because 
they're surrounded by likeminded people 

900
00:42:24,451 --> 00:42:26,820
that their views or the prep one's views
and they're not,

901
00:42:27,390 --> 00:42:29,410
or they just look at,
uh,

902
00:42:29,411 --> 00:42:34,020
the mainstream with this sort of 
condemnation as if they're too stupid to

903
00:42:34,290 --> 00:42:36,720
believe what they believe.
Um,

904
00:42:36,810 --> 00:42:38,340
and I think it's,
again,

905
00:42:38,341 --> 00:42:41,100
really unhealthy at a time where the 
mainstream media needs,

906
00:42:41,101 --> 00:42:45,930
it needs its audience more than ever to 
be poles apart from,

907
00:42:46,180 --> 00:42:49,500
from what the great majority of the 
population thinks,

908
00:42:49,501 --> 00:42:52,470
I think is really unfortunate.

909
00:42:52,470 --> 00:42:53,060
Yeah.
And I,

910
00:42:53,060 --> 00:42:54,250
I,
in Australia anyway,

911
00:42:54,251 --> 00:42:55,084
I think it's just a simple matter of the
politics of the individuals within the 

912
00:42:58,471 --> 00:42:59,304
media tends to be very much on the left 
as it has in your been for the 

913
00:43:03,350 --> 00:43:04,200
generations.
And,

914
00:43:04,610 --> 00:43:07,190
um,
and the,

915
00:43:07,260 --> 00:43:10,380
the,
the rest of the population is a lot more

916
00:43:10,381 --> 00:43:13,560
diverse than that.
It's a lot more nuanced than that.

917
00:43:13,561 --> 00:43:14,394
You know?
Uh,

918
00:43:15,060 --> 00:43:15,893
and,
uh,

919
00:43:16,020 --> 00:43:18,180
and they've used aren't being properly 
reflected.

920
00:43:18,260 --> 00:43:19,093
Uh,
um,

921
00:43:19,140 --> 00:43:19,973
of course there are conservative 
commentators and writers and 

922
00:43:21,601 --> 00:43:22,434
journalists,
but very much in the minority and not 

923
00:43:24,961 --> 00:43:28,630
reflecting the number of voters who are,
um,

924
00:43:29,220 --> 00:43:30,080
leaning that way.

925
00:43:30,210 --> 00:43:31,043
Yeah.
How much of this stuff do you think is 

926
00:43:32,281 --> 00:43:35,670
actually just purely the fault of 
education,

927
00:43:35,880 --> 00:43:38,520
be it in Australia or be it here or 
wherever?

928
00:43:38,521 --> 00:43:39,730
I mean,
I was watching the,

929
00:43:39,731 --> 00:43:41,220
the Charlotte,
uh,

930
00:43:41,250 --> 00:43:44,370
the riot and there was this guy and they
found a protest or,

931
00:43:44,371 --> 00:43:48,510
and he was screaming about trump.
And I'll preface this with saying,

932
00:43:48,511 --> 00:43:51,830
this is not a defense of trump,
but trump is not empower.

933
00:43:51,930 --> 00:43:52,763
Now he's not the president or the 
governor of the state or the mayor of 

934
00:43:55,231 --> 00:43:57,750
that city.
And the guy was blaming trump.

935
00:43:57,751 --> 00:43:58,584
And it's like,
I'm not saying you should be blaming 

936
00:43:59,521 --> 00:44:00,354
Hillary,
and I'm not even saying you should be 

937
00:44:01,621 --> 00:44:03,420
blaming Obama,
but you're,

938
00:44:03,421 --> 00:44:08,421
you're misdirecting things at somebody 
that has literally nothing to do.

939
00:44:08,880 --> 00:44:12,480
No power in place has anything to do 
with trump right now.

940
00:44:12,570 --> 00:44:14,820
And to me,
that's an education problem,

941
00:44:14,821 --> 00:44:17,340
not a,
a political problem.

942
00:44:18,940 --> 00:44:21,140
Very much.
And a Yay.

943
00:44:21,730 --> 00:44:23,650
It,
those opinions come from ignorance,

944
00:44:23,651 --> 00:44:27,430
but they are supported again by quite 
often by mainstream media.

945
00:44:27,850 --> 00:44:28,661
Now I remember,
you know,

946
00:44:28,661 --> 00:44:29,494
after even Orlando there was talk about 
trump as if he had anything to do with 

947
00:44:35,461 --> 00:44:36,294
it.
The Alando massive gain is just absurd 

948
00:44:38,730 --> 00:44:39,563
to be blaming him.
You imagine how this news would be 

949
00:44:43,921 --> 00:44:44,754
reported if it was a bunch of trump 
supporters were tearing apart a city 

950
00:44:48,300 --> 00:44:49,860
where,
you know,

951
00:44:50,370 --> 00:44:51,203
bashing by standards or just the color 
of this game who were looting and that 

952
00:44:55,860 --> 00:44:59,670
and just causing this widespread 
widespread mayhem and destruction.

953
00:44:59,790 --> 00:45:01,280
Yeah,
yeah.

954
00:45:01,290 --> 00:45:04,320
It is.
It is completely idiotic.

955
00:45:04,321 --> 00:45:06,330
But it's become almost a joke,
you know,

956
00:45:06,331 --> 00:45:09,000
and whenever something horrible happens 
around the world,

957
00:45:09,030 --> 00:45:10,620
you know,
you'd be blame brexit.

958
00:45:10,621 --> 00:45:13,170
You blame trump,
you blame the crusades.

959
00:45:13,171 --> 00:45:14,004
You know,
you can't ever actually pin point the 

960
00:45:15,721 --> 00:45:18,420
blame at the people responsible.
Cause that would be,

961
00:45:18,421 --> 00:45:20,550
you know,
probably racist and gross,

962
00:45:20,670 --> 00:45:22,450
the gross and racist.
We know that.

963
00:45:22,650 --> 00:45:23,483
Um,
I want to back up a little bit to some 

964
00:45:24,701 --> 00:45:25,534
of your history because you weren't 
always a public person and a journalist 

965
00:45:28,541 --> 00:45:29,770
and someone that's,
you know,

966
00:45:29,771 --> 00:45:33,010
staked out controversial positions.
You were actually,

967
00:45:33,040 --> 00:45:35,650
you were a private citizen.
You were in banking at first,

968
00:45:35,651 --> 00:45:36,484
right?

969
00:45:36,740 --> 00:45:37,610
Laura,
yet

970
00:45:38,680 --> 00:45:41,560
you to go from a,
a normal job to somebody that's,

971
00:45:41,860 --> 00:45:44,650
that's out there putting their,
their face with their words.

972
00:45:45,960 --> 00:45:46,793
I know I was in studio,
a same industry with the good prospects 

973
00:45:50,941 --> 00:45:53,370
and good income and you know,
that Matt.

974
00:45:53,371 --> 00:45:55,290
And then we'll miss score if he just 
wasn't for me.

975
00:45:55,291 --> 00:45:56,124
I thought I want to go,
I want to go into an industry where 

976
00:45:57,301 --> 00:45:58,134
there's massive job losses and where I'm
going to be the tiniest of tiny 

977
00:46:02,191 --> 00:46:04,080
minorities.
Um,

978
00:46:04,260 --> 00:46:06,300
it will,
it wasn't completely planned.

979
00:46:06,301 --> 00:46:09,300
It was fairly accidental,
but he was a happy accident.

980
00:46:09,301 --> 00:46:10,134
And,
uh,

981
00:46:10,170 --> 00:46:11,720
you know,
I needed decade in,

982
00:46:11,721 --> 00:46:12,554
in,
in finance and I think I enjoyed my 

983
00:46:15,301 --> 00:46:17,250
seven,
but by the end of it I just had enough.

984
00:46:17,430 --> 00:46:19,280
And um,
uh,

985
00:46:19,710 --> 00:46:21,960
I had much higher than that,
that point too.

986
00:46:21,961 --> 00:46:25,980
So it sort of gave me an opportunity to 
rethink things.

987
00:46:25,981 --> 00:46:28,500
I went back to university,
I did my master's,

988
00:46:28,980 --> 00:46:30,780
um,
which was a,

989
00:46:30,781 --> 00:46:31,614
again,
that's kind of cemented some of my 

990
00:46:33,781 --> 00:46:38,190
thoughts about higher education and just
how many junk degrees there are.

991
00:46:38,191 --> 00:46:42,860
Just completely pointless,
just settling basically.

992
00:46:43,300 --> 00:46:46,180
Do you think higher education is a waste
altogether?

993
00:46:46,280 --> 00:46:47,113
Right?

994
00:46:47,600 --> 00:46:47,981
Oh No,
no,

995
00:46:47,981 --> 00:46:48,814
not a waste all together.
I just think in Australia in particular 

996
00:46:52,371 --> 00:46:55,310
anyway,
there are so many of these junk degrees,

997
00:46:55,311 --> 00:46:59,380
they don't qualify you to do anything 
that saddled students with big debts,

998
00:46:59,900 --> 00:47:00,733
raise their expectations and they come 
out and they know more qualified for a 

999
00:47:04,881 --> 00:47:07,370
job.
And then when they went in and you know,

1000
00:47:07,640 --> 00:47:12,230
a lot of buddies just lefty 
indoctrination posing as education.

1001
00:47:12,231 --> 00:47:14,330
It's just absurd.
Um,

1002
00:47:14,510 --> 00:47:15,343
and uh,
you know,

1003
00:47:15,440 --> 00:47:18,370
I'm all for having even more degrees 
for,

1004
00:47:18,410 --> 00:47:19,243
you know,
doctors and nurses and architects and 

1005
00:47:21,651 --> 00:47:23,330
accountants,
things that actually,

1006
00:47:23,360 --> 00:47:25,610
you know,
teach you how to do a certain job,

1007
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:26,750
but,
you know,

1008
00:47:26,750 --> 00:47:28,400
bloody,
uh,

1009
00:47:28,460 --> 00:47:32,230
master's in gender dance therapy or 
something else or just,

1010
00:47:32,231 --> 00:47:33,260
um,
rides.

1011
00:47:33,440 --> 00:47:34,360
Anyway.
Um,

1012
00:47:34,450 --> 00:47:35,380
so yeah,
it will,

1013
00:47:35,381 --> 00:47:37,220
it was all,
uh,

1014
00:47:37,810 --> 00:47:39,880
again,
it wasn't planned.

1015
00:47:39,940 --> 00:47:43,000
I was,
it was a by chance and just,

1016
00:47:43,090 --> 00:47:46,720
uh,
I'm finding myself,

1017
00:47:46,721 --> 00:47:48,280
I guess,
so that's such a wonky term.

1018
00:47:48,281 --> 00:47:49,400
But Anyway,
um,

1019
00:47:49,420 --> 00:47:51,280
here I am and it's,
it's worked out well.

1020
00:47:51,650 --> 00:47:52,850
Yeah.
So here you are.

1021
00:47:52,851 --> 00:47:53,621
It's worked out well.
We,

1022
00:47:53,621 --> 00:47:54,950
we connected on twitter,
I don't know,

1023
00:47:54,951 --> 00:47:56,930
maybe six months ago or so.
And I thought,

1024
00:47:57,290 --> 00:48:00,260
wow,
here's someone else across the world,

1025
00:48:00,290 --> 00:48:01,123
uh,
who,

1026
00:48:01,280 --> 00:48:02,470
who gets it,
who,

1027
00:48:02,480 --> 00:48:03,101
you know,
I,

1028
00:48:03,101 --> 00:48:05,450
I sense cares about the same things I 
care about.

1029
00:48:05,750 --> 00:48:08,630
I see you every now and again.
You fight with some of the haters.

1030
00:48:08,690 --> 00:48:11,870
I'm not big on fighting with the haters 
as a general rule.

1031
00:48:11,871 --> 00:48:15,860
And I see them spewing all sorts of 
genuinely racist,

1032
00:48:15,861 --> 00:48:17,840
awful things at you.
They often,

1033
00:48:17,870 --> 00:48:20,680
they often think that you're another 
nationality than you are,

1034
00:48:20,681 --> 00:48:21,370
or religion.

1035
00:48:21,370 --> 00:48:25,400
I think I'm Indian or Pakistani.
Yesterday I was copying it back.

1036
00:48:25,401 --> 00:48:28,040
Yesterday I had someone,
I told them,

1037
00:48:28,041 --> 00:48:28,874
I'm not Indiana cause you know,
all their sort of a piece was framed 

1038
00:48:31,731 --> 00:48:34,520
around me being Indian or Hindu.
Like never,

1039
00:48:34,521 --> 00:48:37,340
never don't know anybody.
There had never been there.

1040
00:48:37,700 --> 00:48:38,533
I've got to know me and they just refuse
to accept it then I've know you are in 

1041
00:48:41,450 --> 00:48:43,940
Dnx.
All thought it was hilarious.

1042
00:48:44,900 --> 00:48:47,240
Look,
it is a really fine balance.

1043
00:48:48,290 --> 00:48:49,310
I tell people,
you know,

1044
00:48:49,311 --> 00:48:52,430
if I'm giving them advice about 
twitter's is like don't feed the trolls,

1045
00:48:52,431 --> 00:48:54,410
don't acknowledge them,
their attention seekers,

1046
00:48:54,411 --> 00:48:56,390
they're desperate for any sort of 
attention.

1047
00:48:56,780 --> 00:48:58,640
So don't give them what they are looking
for.

1048
00:48:59,210 --> 00:49:00,043
But on the other hand,
every now and then I know my whole is 

1049
00:49:02,061 --> 00:49:02,894
enjoyed.
It's good to call out some filthy 

1050
00:49:08,661 --> 00:49:13,661
hypocrites and just highlight the EDC,
highlight BDC and hypocrisy and violence

1051
00:49:15,171 --> 00:49:18,410
of some of these social justice warriors
who think,

1052
00:49:18,650 --> 00:49:20,120
you know,
their,

1053
00:49:20,121 --> 00:49:23,780
their morals are pristine and who thinks
they're better than the rest of us,

1054
00:49:23,900 --> 00:49:27,830
but they're quite often fairly vile 
human beings.

1055
00:49:27,830 --> 00:49:30,860
And I'm happy to mock them.
I'm happy to,

1056
00:49:31,340 --> 00:49:32,173
uh,
you know,

1057
00:49:32,680 --> 00:49:35,930
how like them to the followers and let 
them have their fun with the mom.

1058
00:49:36,200 --> 00:49:37,033
But I knowledge the other way your way,
which is just don't acknowledge them 

1059
00:49:40,401 --> 00:49:43,130
because you know,
I get literally some days,

1060
00:49:43,190 --> 00:49:46,430
thousands and thousands of mentions and 
I can't even read all of them.

1061
00:49:46,431 --> 00:49:47,840
And I certainly don't,
you know,

1062
00:49:47,900 --> 00:49:49,850
respond to all of them.
Um,

1063
00:49:50,330 --> 00:49:52,730
and it does seem like sometimes,
you know,

1064
00:49:52,731 --> 00:49:55,970
the overwhelming bulk,
a decent comments,

1065
00:49:55,971 --> 00:49:56,804
intelligent comments that you're not 
acknowledging and you're acknowledging 

1066
00:49:59,001 --> 00:50:00,830
the loon lunatic.
Right?

1067
00:50:00,860 --> 00:50:04,280
And that seems to be a sort of cancer 
counter intuitive.

1068
00:50:04,281 --> 00:50:06,330
But I think we've got to,
um,

1069
00:50:06,560 --> 00:50:07,393
highlight the mentality of these people,
particularly when they pretend to be 

1070
00:50:10,460 --> 00:50:12,470
morally superior to the rest of us.

1071
00:50:12,620 --> 00:50:13,181
Right.
So that,

1072
00:50:13,181 --> 00:50:14,014
that's an interesting piece of this 
cause we've got the social justice 

1073
00:50:16,131 --> 00:50:16,964
warrior class that are moralizing all of
us and telling us how racist we are and 

1074
00:50:21,111 --> 00:50:23,240
all this nonsense.
And then at the same time,

1075
00:50:23,420 --> 00:50:26,020
there absolutely is a piece of this 
alright.

1076
00:50:26,090 --> 00:50:30,200
Thing that I've talked about bit a bit 
on this show where I get it,

1077
00:50:30,201 --> 00:50:31,034
they're,
they're pepe the frog and Heran Bay and 

1078
00:50:32,391 --> 00:50:33,224
they're trolling everybody and then they
get Hillary to talk about the frog and 

1079
00:50:36,111 --> 00:50:36,944
they're just internet meme poster is 
there shit posters and they want to 

1080
00:50:39,321 --> 00:50:41,780
upset everybody and they,
I think they're perfectly harmless.

1081
00:50:42,080 --> 00:50:42,913
But I also do see the real white 
nationalists stuff and I don't know how 

1082
00:50:46,251 --> 00:50:48,530
much of that.
So my question to you really is,

1083
00:50:49,010 --> 00:50:49,843
do you think it's just I go back and 
forth basically between thinking that 

1084
00:50:52,731 --> 00:50:53,564
it's healthy when they get this stuff 
out because then it's not just hidden 

1085
00:50:56,601 --> 00:50:59,300
and secretive and even though they 
anonymous whatever,

1086
00:50:59,301 --> 00:51:01,250
they're getting it out versus on another
hand.

1087
00:51:01,251 --> 00:51:04,850
In the last year I had seen more 
blatant,

1088
00:51:04,880 --> 00:51:06,890
true hate,
uh,

1089
00:51:06,891 --> 00:51:10,340
than ever before on mine.
So I'm not sure which one I,

1090
00:51:10,400 --> 00:51:12,800
whether I think this is actually healthy
or,

1091
00:51:12,980 --> 00:51:13,813
or not.

1092
00:51:15,310 --> 00:51:15,920
Yeah,
I,

1093
00:51:15,920 --> 00:51:17,920
I'm,
I haven't set my mind to that too.

1094
00:51:17,921 --> 00:51:18,940
I'm not,
I'm not sure.

1095
00:51:18,941 --> 00:51:19,774
I mean,
you just seem like an absolute is sewer 

1096
00:51:21,251 --> 00:51:22,320
at times.
Twitter,

1097
00:51:22,321 --> 00:51:23,154
you know,
more so than any other social media 

1098
00:51:26,620 --> 00:51:27,453
forum.
It seems to be just a bio field slur 

1099
00:51:31,361 --> 00:51:35,380
full of people who are miserable,
who just want to fight.

1100
00:51:35,590 --> 00:51:36,670
And,
uh,

1101
00:51:38,280 --> 00:51:39,113
yeah,
it,

1102
00:51:39,880 --> 00:51:41,550
uh,
those,

1103
00:51:41,551 --> 00:51:45,430
uh,
really not nasty Nazi,

1104
00:51:45,750 --> 00:51:47,170
uh,
types.

1105
00:51:47,171 --> 00:51:48,004
I haven't encountered too many.
I've had a few and I've just bought 

1106
00:51:50,741 --> 00:51:51,660
them.
Um,

1107
00:51:52,120 --> 00:51:54,340
uh,
but there've been very few in numbers as

1108
00:51:54,341 --> 00:51:55,174
far as the ones attacking maze now that 
I'm not sure of the size of that 

1109
00:51:58,300 --> 00:52:00,960
population.
And I think it's any way Nia,

1110
00:52:01,030 --> 00:52:03,820
the size of the,
of the other side.

1111
00:52:03,821 --> 00:52:06,250
But yeah,
any sign of them isn't healthy.

1112
00:52:06,251 --> 00:52:07,084
And again,
I think they should be treated with 

1113
00:52:08,771 --> 00:52:11,950
absolute disdain that should be called 
out.

1114
00:52:11,950 --> 00:52:14,710
They should be mocked.
And that's what I tend to do.

1115
00:52:14,740 --> 00:52:15,690
I don't try to,
you know,

1116
00:52:15,760 --> 00:52:18,340
convince these people.
I ain't tried to reeducate them.

1117
00:52:18,341 --> 00:52:20,470
I just mock them because that's all they
deserve.

1118
00:52:20,490 --> 00:52:22,690
They don't deserve your time,
they don't deserve,

1119
00:52:23,170 --> 00:52:24,003
you know,
and I think twitter is a really dumb 

1120
00:52:25,150 --> 00:52:27,430
forum for in depth arguments.
You know,

1121
00:52:27,431 --> 00:52:29,380
you just kind of have them,
it's just,

1122
00:52:29,560 --> 00:52:32,470
that's not the place for,
uh,

1123
00:52:33,100 --> 00:52:34,390
discussions.
Yeah.

1124
00:52:34,391 --> 00:52:39,391
You try to frame your point of view in 
it as fewer characters as possible.

1125
00:52:40,120 --> 00:52:40,953
Um,
and if you actually trying to have a 

1126
00:52:42,640 --> 00:52:43,473
proper discussion,
I just don't think that's the forum for 

1127
00:52:45,071 --> 00:52:45,320
it.

1128
00:52:45,320 --> 00:52:46,153
Yeah.
Do you see a new center sort of lining 

1129
00:52:48,291 --> 00:52:52,490
up all over the world?
Cause I think even a year ago or so,

1130
00:52:52,491 --> 00:52:53,324
people were barely talking about this.
I'm talking about the people that are 

1131
00:52:56,300 --> 00:52:57,133
not the far right prue white 
supremacists or racist or whatever you 

1132
00:53:00,891 --> 00:53:02,090
want to call them.
And you know,

1133
00:53:02,091 --> 00:53:04,250
I don't like using all the buzzwords and
not,

1134
00:53:04,730 --> 00:53:07,850
and not the regressive left and all the 
sjws and all that,

1135
00:53:08,210 --> 00:53:12,320
but that there is some sort of new 
center lining up and it's because of the

1136
00:53:12,321 --> 00:53:15,290
Internet because people like us had been
able to,

1137
00:53:15,320 --> 00:53:16,153
uh,
to connect that my friend Ali Rizvi up 

1138
00:53:17,661 --> 00:53:19,820
in Canada who's an atheist Muslim coined
the phrase,

1139
00:53:19,821 --> 00:53:21,130
the new center.
He said that's,

1140
00:53:21,140 --> 00:53:21,973
that's the new home politically.
Do you sense that this could actually 

1141
00:53:24,111 --> 00:53:25,100
become a political

1142
00:53:27,660 --> 00:53:28,493
absolutely.
I think political parties are starting 

1143
00:53:30,061 --> 00:53:35,061
to recognize what the electorate cares 
about and they need,

1144
00:53:35,530 --> 00:53:36,363
you've got to think the Republicans have
to regroup over the next decade and 

1145
00:53:41,550 --> 00:53:45,390
recognize that they abandoned their 
base,

1146
00:53:45,420 --> 00:53:50,070
that they had so many people so 
desperately unhappy with them.

1147
00:53:50,460 --> 00:53:52,200
Um,
and so eager to jump on the,

1148
00:53:52,201 --> 00:53:54,780
on the trump train and in Australia as 
well,

1149
00:53:54,781 --> 00:53:56,070
you know,
in the last election,

1150
00:53:56,100 --> 00:53:57,200
uh,
uh,

1151
00:53:57,510 --> 00:53:59,420
something between one or 2 million 
votes,

1152
00:54:00,450 --> 00:54:02,700
2 million voters.
And that's a significant figure here.

1153
00:54:02,701 --> 00:54:05,220
We're a small country of conservative 
voters,

1154
00:54:05,221 --> 00:54:08,060
took their vote elsewhere from,
from the mainstream,

1155
00:54:08,250 --> 00:54:11,790
a conservative,
a liberal national coalition.

1156
00:54:12,040 --> 00:54:14,700
Um,
so I think there is this new center,

1157
00:54:14,930 --> 00:54:17,250
um,
and where it is,

1158
00:54:17,320 --> 00:54:19,730
is the question,
I think it's a far more,

1159
00:54:20,140 --> 00:54:20,973
uh,
to the right then the media class would 

1160
00:54:23,910 --> 00:54:26,730
want it to be and acknowledge it to be,
um,

1161
00:54:27,450 --> 00:54:28,920
I don't mean their right wing.

1162
00:54:28,920 --> 00:54:30,330
I just think that,
you know,

1163
00:54:30,540 --> 00:54:31,373
in their economic point of view,
in their attitude to borders and 

1164
00:54:34,951 --> 00:54:39,060
immigration and national security,
they're far more,

1165
00:54:39,320 --> 00:54:42,840
um,
conservative then then the media class,

1166
00:54:42,920 --> 00:54:43,753
uh,
would like them to be and acknowledging 

1167
00:54:44,591 --> 00:54:45,424
them to be.
So I think the politicians have no 

1168
00:54:48,901 --> 00:54:51,090
choice but to acknowledge it.
Yeah.

1169
00:54:51,091 --> 00:54:54,510
They can't ignore it.
Then their political survival depends on

1170
00:54:54,511 --> 00:54:55,344
it.
So,

1171
00:54:55,380 --> 00:54:56,530
um,
but whether you let me,

1172
00:54:56,531 --> 00:54:57,364
you actually see the emergence of the 
new party is something else too to 

1173
00:55:00,781 --> 00:55:02,190
ponder.
I'm not sure about that.

1174
00:55:02,220 --> 00:55:04,350
But um,
there's talk of that in Australia.

1175
00:55:04,351 --> 00:55:05,940
There's talk about,
um,

1176
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:06,833
an actual new conservative party that 
will bring in all these sort of minor 

1177
00:55:11,281 --> 00:55:13,220
parties.
Losier's um,

1178
00:55:13,440 --> 00:55:14,273
but it hasn't happened.
It's something that's been talked about 

1179
00:55:15,691 --> 00:55:18,300
or whether it actually been choice is 
another question.

1180
00:55:18,301 --> 00:55:18,710
Yeah.

1181
00:55:18,710 --> 00:55:20,060
I think it's interesting that,
you know,

1182
00:55:20,061 --> 00:55:22,580
a second ago you started to say that 
they're more right,

1183
00:55:22,610 --> 00:55:24,710
but you really meant conservative and 
then you,

1184
00:55:24,980 --> 00:55:25,690
you fixed.

1185
00:55:25,690 --> 00:55:26,523
Yeah,
yeah.

1186
00:55:27,180 --> 00:55:28,360
I do to change,

1187
00:55:28,490 --> 00:55:28,961
but no,
no,

1188
00:55:28,961 --> 00:55:29,500
no.
But I,

1189
00:55:29,500 --> 00:55:34,270
I bring that up only because it's like 
even people like you to make your point,

1190
00:55:34,271 --> 00:55:36,760
you still want to be so concerned about 
the language.

1191
00:55:36,761 --> 00:55:38,890
And I feel that too,
because we're,

1192
00:55:39,100 --> 00:55:42,460
we're so just under this thing where if 
you say one thing wrong and implied that

1193
00:55:42,461 --> 00:55:44,440
the conservatives are really far right 
or that,

1194
00:55:44,710 --> 00:55:46,660
that everyone will be all over you.
And that what a,

1195
00:55:46,870 --> 00:55:49,750
what a crazy place for people like us to
be in.

1196
00:55:49,860 --> 00:55:51,060
Oh,
it's insane.

1197
00:55:51,061 --> 00:55:51,894
It is.
People are just so hyper sensitive to 

1198
00:55:53,461 --> 00:55:53,971
the,
you know,

1199
00:55:53,971 --> 00:55:54,804
and so looking to be offended by 
something or take something out of 

1200
00:55:58,591 --> 00:56:01,050
context that you do sometimes,
you know,

1201
00:56:01,051 --> 00:56:01,884
even someone who doesn't want to,
doesn't give a stuff about political 

1202
00:56:05,071 --> 00:56:05,904
correctness.
You find yourself qualifying things and 

1203
00:56:08,370 --> 00:56:11,430
explaining things like over explaining 
things.

1204
00:56:11,431 --> 00:56:12,510
It's,
yeah,

1205
00:56:12,511 --> 00:56:13,460
it's,
it's,

1206
00:56:13,890 --> 00:56:15,990
I guess we're not immune to it either.
We've,

1207
00:56:16,090 --> 00:56:19,980
we live in that world and we have to 
acknowledge it.

1208
00:56:20,440 --> 00:56:21,273
I wish we were over.
I see people on twitter telling me 

1209
00:56:22,601 --> 00:56:24,850
sometimes times we could see it get over
yourself,

1210
00:56:24,851 --> 00:56:25,830
like,
you know,

1211
00:56:25,840 --> 00:56:27,160
just stop.
But you know,

1212
00:56:27,161 --> 00:56:29,770
I'm,
I'm still trying to be a person that,

1213
00:56:30,040 --> 00:56:33,130
a good person that exists in 2016 so,
so my last,

1214
00:56:33,160 --> 00:56:35,920
my last question for you is taking 
everything that we've discussed here,

1215
00:56:36,170 --> 00:56:38,730
um,
what do you think the best thing for,

1216
00:56:38,770 --> 00:56:41,020
for people that are,
that are hearing our messages,

1217
00:56:41,021 --> 00:56:41,854
whether they a little more right or 
conservative or a little more left or 

1218
00:56:45,101 --> 00:56:45,934
liberal or whatever it is for all of 
these people that are hearing this and 

1219
00:56:48,311 --> 00:56:51,130
seeing the same trends that you're 
talking about all over the world,

1220
00:56:51,550 --> 00:56:55,690
what is the best thing that they can do 
to help fix some of this stuff?

1221
00:56:57,670 --> 00:56:59,460
Be Brave.
Be Bold.

1222
00:56:59,461 --> 00:57:00,294
Say what she think.
I think that's the message to take out 

1223
00:57:02,941 --> 00:57:04,360
of it.
Don't be afraid,

1224
00:57:04,361 --> 00:57:07,500
don't be bullied into silence.
Don't feel like,

1225
00:57:07,710 --> 00:57:11,460
uh,
your point of view isn't worthy of being

1226
00:57:11,461 --> 00:57:13,840
aired and discussed.
And don't worry about,

1227
00:57:13,850 --> 00:57:15,150
you know,
if you say something,

1228
00:57:16,200 --> 00:57:17,033
you're going to be unfriended on 
facebook by someone you went to school 

1229
00:57:19,141 --> 00:57:20,670
with 20 years ago.
You know,

1230
00:57:20,900 --> 00:57:21,733
I just think people need to be,
people need to be brave and have and be 

1231
00:57:26,131 --> 00:57:27,280
interested.
You know,

1232
00:57:27,340 --> 00:57:30,180
be easy.
I wouldn't force anybody to,

1233
00:57:30,770 --> 00:57:33,120
to become political nuts,
but you know,

1234
00:57:33,121 --> 00:57:35,580
if you care about this stuff,
get interested,

1235
00:57:35,581 --> 00:57:37,700
read,
uh,

1236
00:57:37,770 --> 00:57:41,850
read different sources,
find out what's really happening and um,

1237
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:44,160
don't be shy.
They're putting your 2 cents in.

1238
00:57:44,460 --> 00:57:45,510
Yeah.
Well I,

1239
00:57:45,610 --> 00:57:47,550
that's what I say on the,
on the show every week.

1240
00:57:47,551 --> 00:57:49,940
So I will co sign that one.
Alright.

1241
00:57:50,010 --> 00:57:50,440
Well,
Rita,

1242
00:57:50,440 --> 00:57:51,273
it was a pleasure.
I'm so glad we finally connected and we 

1243
00:57:53,671 --> 00:57:55,710
were supposed to have you a couple of 
days ago in our Internet blew out.

1244
00:57:55,711 --> 00:57:56,544
I think we,
somebody is watching us and they didn't 

1245
00:57:57,781 --> 00:57:58,614
want us to connect.

1246
00:57:58,820 --> 00:57:59,653
Well,
I don't even believe that was just 

1247
00:58:00,561 --> 00:58:01,394
coincidence.
There's obviously some sort of the left 

1248
00:58:03,550 --> 00:58:05,580
wing conspiracy to silence.
Now.

1249
00:58:05,650 --> 00:58:07,970
I don't think there's any other 
explanation possible.

1250
00:58:08,830 --> 00:58:11,800
Definitely some sort of left wing 
conspiracy a.

1251
00:58:11,830 --> 00:58:13,330
Anyway,
you guys can follow Rita.

1252
00:58:13,331 --> 00:58:17,620
It's at Rita Panahi on twitter and she 
can follow her writing,

1253
00:58:17,890 --> 00:58:20,350
uh,
over at the Australian Harold's son.

1254
00:58:20,590 --> 00:58:21,131
Uh,
Rita.

1255
00:58:21,131 --> 00:58:22,420
It was a pleasure.
So we'll,

1256
00:58:22,421 --> 00:58:24,220
we'll keep doing this in 140 characters.
