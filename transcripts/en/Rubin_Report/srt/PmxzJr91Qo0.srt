1
00:00:02,790 --> 00:00:05,190
To start this week's direct message with
a trigger warning.

2
00:00:05,191 --> 00:00:06,570
That's right,
so take a moment,

3
00:00:06,810 --> 00:00:07,643
get a design comfy,
and move carefully to your safe space 

4
00:00:09,871 --> 00:00:11,910
because we've got to talk.
I'll actually wait for

5
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:14,980
bit.

6
00:00:27,710 --> 00:00:28,680
All right.
I think that did it.

7
00:00:28,710 --> 00:00:30,690
Now that you've been triggered,
warranty Leah,

8
00:00:30,780 --> 00:00:31,613
let's talk about free speech.
It feels like it's on the ropes these 

9
00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:34,350
days,
right?

10
00:00:34,350 --> 00:00:35,183
Well,
we've been talking a lot about it here 

11
00:00:36,121 --> 00:00:36,954
in the context of how the regressive 
stifled debate by calling everyone 

12
00:00:40,051 --> 00:00:41,070
racist,
sexist,

13
00:00:41,071 --> 00:00:42,330
homophobic,
or the rest.

14
00:00:42,630 --> 00:00:43,463
This very concept tolerance for 
intolerance has been taking root at 

15
00:00:47,041 --> 00:00:50,730
college campuses across the country for 
quite some time now.

16
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:51,593
There are two completely separate 
situations unfolding right this very 

17
00:00:54,181 --> 00:00:55,014
moment.
One is on the campus of Yale where some 

18
00:00:56,491 --> 00:00:57,324
students were upset that a professor 
wrote a letter defending the right to 

19
00:01:00,571 --> 00:01:01,404
wear offensive Halloween costumes.
The letter in part explained that you 

20
00:01:04,171 --> 00:01:05,004
can either ignore the costume altogether
or you can engage in the person wearing 

21
00:01:08,821 --> 00:01:11,250
the costume,
telling them why you find it offensive.

22
00:01:11,550 --> 00:01:12,383
Apparently this wasn't enough for some 
of the students culminating and video 

23
00:01:15,150 --> 00:01:18,500
that has now gone viral in which a 
student's screams at the dean quote.

24
00:01:18,690 --> 00:01:21,480
It's not about creating an intellectual 
space.

25
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:26,720
It's about creating a home here.
The other situation is at the University

26
00:01:26,970 --> 00:01:27,803
of Missouri where students were fed up 
with a series of racially motivated 

27
00:01:29,881 --> 00:01:30,714
instances they felt weren't being 
properly dealt with by the 

28
00:01:33,001 --> 00:01:33,834
administration.
The students demand to the resignation 

29
00:01:35,791 --> 00:01:36,624
of the president,
which he submitted after the mostly 

30
00:01:38,911 --> 00:01:43,110
black football team got involved.
A video on campus has also gone viral,

31
00:01:43,111 --> 00:01:45,660
showing a young journalist trying to 
cover the protest,

32
00:01:45,990 --> 00:01:48,570
but being screamed at and bullied by a 
group of students.

33
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:49,613
Ironically,
these students are trying to silence 

34
00:01:51,211 --> 00:01:52,044
someone who was only there to cover the 
very protest that they wanted attention 

35
00:01:55,231 --> 00:01:56,064
for.
For one of the oldest and largest 

36
00:01:57,391 --> 00:01:58,224
journalism schools in America.
It seems that Mou has gotten something 

37
00:02:00,691 --> 00:02:03,180
very wrong about free speech.
Of course,

38
00:02:03,181 --> 00:02:05,400
these two instances are not isolated in 
America,

39
00:02:05,430 --> 00:02:07,560
nor in other parts of the Western world.

40
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:08,393
Colleges and universities are the very 
places you're supposed to go to engage 

41
00:02:11,881 --> 00:02:12,714
in the battle of ideas.
To learn new ways of thinking and to 

42
00:02:15,031 --> 00:02:15,864
challenge your preconceived notions.
Yet somehow colleges are the very place 

43
00:02:19,381 --> 00:02:22,140
that had become hostile to all of these 
concepts.

44
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:25,530
Now shouting down speakers you don't 
agree with demanding professors,

45
00:02:25,531 --> 00:02:26,364
be fired for contrarian views and 
denying the media free and unfettered 

46
00:02:29,761 --> 00:02:33,600
access have found their home in these 
safe spaces.

47
00:02:33,690 --> 00:02:34,523
Of course,
this all ties in perfectly with 

48
00:02:35,431 --> 00:02:37,170
everything we've been talking about on 
this show.

49
00:02:37,171 --> 00:02:38,004
The regressive left by calling everyone 
racists and bigots and homophobes and 

50
00:02:41,101 --> 00:02:45,780
the rest have ushered in a generation of
people who were so sure in their beliefs

51
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:50,700
and so dismissive of their opponents 
ideals that they have no reason to stand

52
00:02:50,701 --> 00:02:54,330
up for free speech anymore.
If your opponent is a racist or a bigot,

53
00:02:54,331 --> 00:02:55,740
then why even engage with them?

54
00:02:55,980 --> 00:02:56,813
You've got the moral high ground,
so just shout them down or call them 

55
00:02:59,290 --> 00:03:01,600
until they give up.
These are the tactics.

56
00:03:01,601 --> 00:03:02,434
The regressive have used successfully in
so many areas and now we're seeing the 

57
00:03:06,251 --> 00:03:08,410
fruits of their labor.
I want to be very clear here.

58
00:03:08,411 --> 00:03:12,610
Nothing I'm saying is dismissive of the 
actual issues these college students are

59
00:03:12,611 --> 00:03:13,444
dealing with.
There is no doubt we have racial 

60
00:03:15,101 --> 00:03:17,440
problems in this country.
We have a quality problems.

61
00:03:17,620 --> 00:03:20,380
We have wealth disparity problems and 
the list goes on and on,

62
00:03:20,620 --> 00:03:23,800
but these problems won't go away if we 
don't talk about them.

63
00:03:23,801 --> 00:03:24,634
They won't magically resolve themselves.
If we only talk to people we agree with 

64
00:03:28,031 --> 00:03:30,190
actually,
they'll only get much worse.

65
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:31,293
This is the inherent flaw of identity 
politics that the regressives love so 

66
00:03:34,661 --> 00:03:35,494
much.
When you whittle us all down just to 

67
00:03:37,121 --> 00:03:38,140
race,
religion,

68
00:03:38,141 --> 00:03:39,670
nationality,
sexuality,

69
00:03:39,671 --> 00:03:44,080
or whatever else there is,
there's very little left to unite us.

70
00:03:44,350 --> 00:03:48,160
I'd much rather look at people based on 
their ideas and their beliefs.

71
00:03:48,310 --> 00:03:49,143
Those are the principles that unite us 
across the divide that the regressive 

72
00:03:52,121 --> 00:03:54,850
left has been digging.
I've been saying for awhile now,

73
00:03:54,851 --> 00:03:57,430
the two things can be true at once.
In this case,

74
00:03:57,431 --> 00:03:58,264
it can be true that these students have 
legitimate grievances and at the same 

75
00:04:00,731 --> 00:04:01,564
time it can be true that free speech 
shouldn't be sacrificed on the altar of 

76
00:04:05,231 --> 00:04:06,064
political correctness.
We should be more worried about the 

77
00:04:07,841 --> 00:04:08,674
government taking away our free speech 
rather than us taking it away from 

78
00:04:11,651 --> 00:04:12,484
ourselves.
Some say the road to hell is paved with 

79
00:04:13,781 --> 00:04:16,630
good intentions.
Some say the ends justify the means.

80
00:04:16,900 --> 00:04:20,050
Some just want to shut you up and that's
when you have to speak the loudest.

81
00:04:22,690 --> 00:04:23,523
Joining me this week as a human rights 
activist who grew up in a place not too 

82
00:04:26,831 --> 00:04:30,160
kind to freethinkers.
Currently he's the Middle East community

83
00:04:30,161 --> 00:04:34,640
manager of movements dot Org and 
organization dedicated to open and close

84
00:04:34,641 --> 00:04:37,450
societies.
He also happens to be in Los Angeles for

85
00:04:37,451 --> 00:04:38,710
the first time,
right?

86
00:04:38,711 --> 00:04:40,230
This very second.
Feisal,

87
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:43,540
Syeda Macarthur who welcome to the show.
Who all affect you that hiring me.

88
00:04:43,541 --> 00:04:47,150
I mean I thank you for bringing sanitary
towel overall.

89
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:49,870
I've been a big fan of your show since 
it started,

90
00:04:49,871 --> 00:04:53,020
so wow.
Saturday to all of the world.

91
00:04:53,510 --> 00:04:57,540
I would say so because like I've seen 
your video being shared of lexile.

92
00:04:57,590 --> 00:05:00,060
I have friends who will live in in the 
Middle East and and,

93
00:05:00,190 --> 00:05:04,810
and they were all talking about you,
so it's certainly great to be here.

94
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:06,160
All right.
That's very rewarding.

95
00:05:06,161 --> 00:05:07,330
We could probably on the show right 
there,

96
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:10,210
we'll talk a little bit about you as 
well.

97
00:05:10,210 --> 00:05:11,140
So,
uh,

98
00:05:11,141 --> 00:05:14,470
I want to talk about your personal story
and coming from Iraq and all that,

99
00:05:14,471 --> 00:05:15,304
which is really,
it's really a wonderful story and it's 

100
00:05:16,511 --> 00:05:19,840
so a perfectly lined up with a lot of 
things we've been talking about here.

101
00:05:19,841 --> 00:05:20,674
But first I want to talk about how I 
came to know you a because the second 

102
00:05:24,341 --> 00:05:26,420
episode that we did have this show on 
Oprah.

103
00:05:26,710 --> 00:05:27,543
I had Karen Santa Maria on and uh,
a few days before that she had been 

104
00:05:32,831 --> 00:05:33,664
tweeting that she was in contact with 
someone that knew somebody in Saudi 

105
00:05:39,610 --> 00:05:44,610
Arabia that was outed as a secular list 
or an atheist and was in trouble there.

106
00:05:45,010 --> 00:05:45,843
Life was threatened,
I think by their father in your name 

107
00:05:48,161 --> 00:05:48,994
then got looped into this.
And then this is a direct through to 

108
00:05:51,101 --> 00:05:51,934
what you do@movements.org.
So can you just tell me a little bit 

109
00:05:54,910 --> 00:05:56,680
about that instance?
Yeah,

110
00:05:56,681 --> 00:05:58,070
I mean that,
why it's a pretty

111
00:05:58,250 --> 00:06:03,250
interesting case to say the least is 
that so the man is,

112
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:06,470
comes from Saudi Arabia and uh,
and he,

113
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:07,333
he also happens to be a lucky one 
because he does have an American 

114
00:06:09,351 --> 00:06:10,184
passport,
so he lives in the United States and he 

115
00:06:12,770 --> 00:06:13,603
went to,
like into a discussion with his father 

116
00:06:14,961 --> 00:06:19,100
on the dinner table and he told him he 
didn't even say like,

117
00:06:19,101 --> 00:06:19,934
he's an atheist.
He just said that he has some doubts 

118
00:06:21,771 --> 00:06:22,604
about God and things of that sort.
And the end result of that conversation 

119
00:06:27,531 --> 00:06:28,364
is that his dad had threatened him that 
he's going to report him to the 

120
00:06:30,651 --> 00:06:34,520
authorities and that actually means in a
country like Saudi Arabia,

121
00:06:34,521 --> 00:06:38,810
which is digitally death or you're going
to get flashed like our friend Dr.

122
00:06:38,811 --> 00:06:40,140
but our,
um,

123
00:06:40,550 --> 00:06:42,680
so far,
uh,

124
00:06:42,740 --> 00:06:46,040
he started contacting a lot of secondary
organizations.

125
00:06:46,041 --> 00:06:47,750
Like,
this is my story.

126
00:06:47,751 --> 00:06:48,220
Um,
I'm,

127
00:06:48,220 --> 00:06:50,330
uh,
I need help and things of that sort.

128
00:06:50,780 --> 00:06:55,780
And he came across Kara and Kara made 
that like she said like,

129
00:06:56,930 --> 00:06:57,763
oh,
I have a friend who can have someone 

130
00:06:58,521 --> 00:07:01,850
inside Arabia and,
and I kind of became the direct person.

131
00:07:02,050 --> 00:07:02,883
Uh,
somebody tagged me on the foot on the 

132
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:08,990
post because that's my work that I try 
to help activists in closed societies.

133
00:07:09,020 --> 00:07:09,853
So basically carry tweeted something 
saying I would like to help this person 

134
00:07:12,081 --> 00:07:14,800
but I don't know what to do and that's 
where you jumped out.

135
00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:19,900
I jumped in and I also jumped in,
in trying to verify his story is true.

136
00:07:20,991 --> 00:07:25,991
And I went back and forth and 
conversation with him to see a like if,

137
00:07:26,030 --> 00:07:26,863
because I mean we have tons and tons of 
cases and it's very important to know 

138
00:07:31,281 --> 00:07:34,670
which ones are true to case because 
every case takes take long time.

139
00:07:34,671 --> 00:07:37,220
Like nothing gets solved.
So I tried to make it too.

140
00:07:37,230 --> 00:07:40,910
We have a vetting system in which we 
make sure that these stories are,

141
00:07:40,970 --> 00:07:43,130
are legitimate.
And then so what do you do?

142
00:07:43,131 --> 00:07:43,964
Like what is the vetting system actually
entail to find out if this guy is 

143
00:07:46,611 --> 00:07:47,444
actually telling the truth and not just 
somebody that wants to get out of the 

144
00:07:49,191 --> 00:07:50,830
country for other reasons.
Yeah,

145
00:07:50,831 --> 00:07:53,870
I mean,
I mean somebody who is a refugee myself.

146
00:07:53,930 --> 00:07:54,763
Uh,
there are certainly questions that 

147
00:07:56,211 --> 00:08:00,740
somebody can know whether this like you 
can ask them specific questions about,

148
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:03,040
uh,
about what,

149
00:08:03,060 --> 00:08:06,310
what they,
what did they say to their parents and a

150
00:08:06,730 --> 00:08:09,190
weather like how is their relationship 
with their parents,

151
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:10,033
you know,
if that is actually like his dad is 

152
00:08:11,241 --> 00:08:12,980
really crazy enough to report him to 
the,

153
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:13,993
like to get his son killed.
Like it's a and try to see like what he 

154
00:08:19,141 --> 00:08:21,890
is trying to achieve.
Like why he wants to leave.

155
00:08:21,900 --> 00:08:24,540
Like what are you trying to achieve when
he wants to leave and,

156
00:08:24,820 --> 00:08:25,653
and things of that sort and try to 
connect if he does no other circles and 

157
00:08:29,631 --> 00:08:30,464
other friends that go through his 
facebook friends and started to see if 

158
00:08:34,340 --> 00:08:35,173
it says like I told this person and 
tried to see if there's like the story 

159
00:08:37,791 --> 00:08:39,480
matches up.
Um,

160
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:41,330
for this story.
I mean,

161
00:08:41,390 --> 00:08:44,750
I admit like I always spend few hours 
because it's very,

162
00:08:44,870 --> 00:08:48,350
was very emergent situation.
What we did is that,

163
00:08:48,860 --> 00:08:49,693
uh,
because he got an American passport so 

164
00:08:50,811 --> 00:08:53,480
there was no visa,
like there's no visa needed,

165
00:08:53,690 --> 00:08:54,523
so we crowdsourced,
we crowdfunded a money to get him to 

166
00:08:58,360 --> 00:08:59,730
United States.
So like within,

167
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:02,760
like I tell him like by,
by five,

168
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:06,150
I think like by 5:00
AM you have to be at the airport,

169
00:09:06,510 --> 00:09:07,343
we only have like 12 hours and just make
sure that you're able to go to the 

170
00:09:11,371 --> 00:09:12,204
airport and within this 12 hours I'm 
going to be able to crowd fund and get 

171
00:09:15,541 --> 00:09:16,620
you the ticket.

172
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:19,470
The ticket was waiting for him at the 
airport.

173
00:09:19,471 --> 00:09:21,060
Yes.
And how are you communicating?

174
00:09:21,061 --> 00:09:22,540
This is done via email.
Well,

175
00:09:22,890 --> 00:09:23,723
in some of these clubs societies,
they use apps like whatsapp and viber 

176
00:09:27,631 --> 00:09:30,360
and all of these stuff because they 
cannot be controlled by the government.

177
00:09:30,620 --> 00:09:31,453
Um,
and he does seem to be a bit of tech 

178
00:09:34,141 --> 00:09:34,974
savvy that he's able to use,
let's call vpn that the government 

179
00:09:38,371 --> 00:09:40,440
cannot track.
Whereas exact location is.

180
00:09:40,830 --> 00:09:41,790
Um,
and also,

181
00:09:41,791 --> 00:09:45,090
I mean,
here's what the crazy part about this is

182
00:09:45,091 --> 00:09:45,924
that there is another case happened 
before by a gal called Hamza coach 

183
00:09:49,740 --> 00:09:50,573
Carter,
and he also came out as an atheist and 

184
00:09:52,741 --> 00:09:53,574
he escaped in Malaysia,
which is so called moderate Muslim 

185
00:09:55,801 --> 00:09:56,634
country and the Saudi government 
contacted the Interpol and got him out 

186
00:10:01,021 --> 00:10:02,820
of the airport there.
So Interpol,

187
00:10:02,821 --> 00:10:03,654
which is a national or international 
position to defend human rights and all 

188
00:10:07,831 --> 00:10:08,664
of that,
they stopped him and get him back to 

189
00:10:10,501 --> 00:10:11,190
Saudi Arabia.

190
00:10:11,190 --> 00:10:14,100
So this guy,
because he got an American citizenship,

191
00:10:14,340 --> 00:10:19,340
Kinda helps in getting him.
He went to Dubai and from why he went to

192
00:10:19,351 --> 00:10:20,730
the United States.
Um,

193
00:10:20,940 --> 00:10:22,110
so yeah,
that's,

194
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:23,513
that's a now he's actually,
he's in the United States and he's in 

195
00:10:25,801 --> 00:10:26,634
the united.
Yeah.

196
00:10:27,140 --> 00:10:29,460
So that's a good success story.
Yeah,

197
00:10:29,461 --> 00:10:30,294
it's a good success story.
And that's why I wanted to jump off 

198
00:10:31,441 --> 00:10:34,440
there with you because that's what you 
guys do@movements.org.

199
00:10:34,441 --> 00:10:35,274
It's a perfect example of technology 
meeting something that's important 

200
00:10:39,510 --> 00:10:40,343
because you guys are literally raising 
money to save secular people and 

201
00:10:44,731 --> 00:10:47,600
atheists.
Yen Not only money.

202
00:10:47,610 --> 00:10:49,860
I mean,
so the whole system of movements.org,

203
00:10:49,861 --> 00:10:50,694
so we crowdsource a human rights,
so what we do is we connect activist 

204
00:10:54,571 --> 00:10:55,404
from clubs,
societies to people in open societies 

205
00:10:57,181 --> 00:10:58,014
who have the skills to help them.
So it can be somebody who's looking for 

206
00:11:01,651 --> 00:11:02,484
a web designer and woman rights 
activists in Afghanistan want to be 

207
00:11:05,071 --> 00:11:06,390
published in the media.

208
00:11:06,390 --> 00:11:08,340
We have a partnership with the New York 
Times,

209
00:11:08,341 --> 00:11:09,174
the woman in the world.
We have partnership with the daily 

210
00:11:10,041 --> 00:11:11,160
beast,
the Huffington Post.

211
00:11:11,340 --> 00:11:12,173
So we try to match what the activists in
this closed societies want with people 

212
00:11:17,071 --> 00:11:17,904
who are on the open societies who have 
the skills to help these specific 

213
00:11:20,221 --> 00:11:21,054
requests.
So it's kind of like multi sided 

214
00:11:22,611 --> 00:11:25,080
platform.
There's request and that our offers.

215
00:11:25,410 --> 00:11:29,550
And then our job is just get a match.com
for four skills,

216
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:30,433
uh,
and also have a partnership with people 

217
00:11:32,291 --> 00:11:33,124
who give organization.
They'll give grants to civil rights 

218
00:11:34,980 --> 00:11:35,813
organizations and things of that sort.
So that's like the main concept of 

219
00:11:38,521 --> 00:11:39,191
movements.
Yeah.

220
00:11:39,191 --> 00:11:42,780
So how do you guys make sure that the 
network of people that you're setting up

221
00:11:42,810 --> 00:11:46,800
isn't being infiltrated either by 
governments or other people that want to

222
00:11:46,801 --> 00:11:48,510
hurt these people?
Yeah,

223
00:11:48,511 --> 00:11:49,344
I mean what I mean,
there's very impossible to have 100 

224
00:11:52,990 --> 00:11:53,860
percent secure system.

225
00:11:53,860 --> 00:11:55,540
So I'm going to be very honest about 
this.

226
00:11:55,541 --> 00:11:57,880
I mean even facebook and Google and all 
of these,

227
00:11:58,120 --> 00:11:58,953
but we.
So we have a vetting system in which 

228
00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:01,653
these people who sign up,
we ask them to put as much information 

229
00:12:05,591 --> 00:12:08,620
as possible to be able for us to be able
to verify this information.

230
00:12:09,220 --> 00:12:13,240
And also we asked people from closed 
societies,

231
00:12:13,241 --> 00:12:15,640
and I'm going to go to the definition of
our societies afterwards,

232
00:12:15,641 --> 00:12:19,050
is that to use anonymous,
uh,

233
00:12:19,330 --> 00:12:22,630
names and like don't use a username that
does not reflect their,

234
00:12:23,020 --> 00:12:23,853
like their actual location or the real 
name for people who are in office 

235
00:12:26,981 --> 00:12:28,660
societies,
it's not really a big problem.

236
00:12:28,661 --> 00:12:33,130
But for people who like live in Saudi 
Arabia and in Pakistan,

237
00:12:33,131 --> 00:12:33,964
in Iraq and all these places,
they would need to use a username and 

238
00:12:37,511 --> 00:12:40,150
they don't give an exact.
Like they don't say,

239
00:12:40,300 --> 00:12:41,133
well this is my zip code and this is my 
address and folks to please come and 

240
00:12:45,570 --> 00:12:48,820
save me,
but they can just make kind of a general

241
00:12:48,821 --> 00:12:49,654
request.

242
00:12:49,750 --> 00:12:50,583
And then within the,
within the messaging service that we 

243
00:12:52,631 --> 00:12:53,464
have,
they can reveal some of the information 

244
00:12:55,660 --> 00:12:58,210
and we also have a very strong security 
in terms of,

245
00:12:58,470 --> 00:13:01,060
of people trying to hock and things of 
that sort.

246
00:13:01,061 --> 00:13:04,510
And the organization started as a result
of funding from Google.

247
00:13:04,511 --> 00:13:08,080
So we get that kind of saved in terms of
security.

248
00:13:08,081 --> 00:13:11,080
We don't have a problem of like big 
hacking and uh,

249
00:13:11,860 --> 00:13:12,820
but yeah,
I mean it is,

250
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:13,713
it is.
It's obviously a possibility that many 

251
00:13:16,091 --> 00:13:18,820
of these governments,
whether it's Iran or Saudi Arabia,

252
00:13:18,821 --> 00:13:21,700
would you try to use a,
uh,

253
00:13:21,940 --> 00:13:25,990
but we can track whether they're tried 
to message people and tell them like,

254
00:13:25,991 --> 00:13:27,550
oh,
what you guys do and things like that.

255
00:13:27,551 --> 00:13:31,600
So also we have the star rating system.
So for every user,

256
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:35,140
no matter how much we've verified that 
information,

257
00:13:35,141 --> 00:13:38,650
we put them on a star rating system from
like zero stars to five stars.

258
00:13:38,650 --> 00:13:39,483
So we ask people a few,
you get messaged by somebody got zero 

259
00:13:42,641 --> 00:13:44,710
stars,
you this person,

260
00:13:44,711 --> 00:13:45,910
watch out,
watch out,

261
00:13:45,970 --> 00:13:46,803
and if it's five stars like people like 
the New York Times or having linkedin 

262
00:13:49,630 --> 00:13:51,280
post.
So that's.

263
00:13:51,430 --> 00:13:52,850
So we,
I mean it's,

264
00:13:52,900 --> 00:13:56,830
it is dependent on the user and we also 
tried to make them cautious that they,

265
00:13:57,300 --> 00:13:58,420
uh,
but as I said,

266
00:13:58,421 --> 00:13:59,620
look,
you cannot prevent,

267
00:14:00,050 --> 00:14:00,883
uh,
all types of attacks from this 

268
00:14:03,250 --> 00:14:04,630
authoritarian governments.
Sure,

269
00:14:04,631 --> 00:14:05,464
sure.
So I want to talk more about the 

270
00:14:05,831 --> 00:14:06,664
authoritarian governance,
but a little bit more about your work 

271
00:14:08,081 --> 00:14:08,914
first.
How much is actually just trying to get 

272
00:14:11,110 --> 00:14:11,943
these people out versus connecting them 
with people in the closed society so 

273
00:14:15,911 --> 00:14:18,550
that they can actually change their 
societies from within.

274
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:21,880
Yeah,
I mean the fact of the matter is,

275
00:14:21,881 --> 00:14:22,714
is that many of the activists,
we have one to do change it their own 

276
00:14:27,041 --> 00:14:27,874
countries.

277
00:14:28,670 --> 00:14:31,360
There is a significant amount that 
actually want to get out.

278
00:14:32,020 --> 00:14:36,460
And getting out business is one of the 
most difficult ones.

279
00:14:36,490 --> 00:14:39,100
And I've been somebody who's a refugee 
myself.

280
00:14:39,940 --> 00:14:43,210
I had,
it took me around three years and I mean

281
00:14:43,211 --> 00:14:45,730
I left Iraq.
I went to Lebanon from Lebanon,

282
00:14:45,731 --> 00:14:50,731
I went to Malaysia and I had to wait and
then like from I left Iraq in 2009,

283
00:14:51,731 --> 00:14:54,220
I would have to United States in 2013.
So it's like,

284
00:14:54,410 --> 00:14:57,590
it's a four year process to actually 
eventually move,

285
00:14:57,591 --> 00:14:59,420
uh,
from a closed societies.

286
00:14:59,450 --> 00:15:02,660
So most of the refugees or the people or
trying to save their life,

287
00:15:02,870 --> 00:15:05,390
they go through like middle countries 
like,

288
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:06,433
so because you're in your own country or
most immediate dangers of many people 

289
00:15:10,291 --> 00:15:11,124
will move to that clause countries and 
their farm country countries moved to 

290
00:15:13,551 --> 00:15:14,384
the West.
So that is extremely difficult process 

291
00:15:17,421 --> 00:15:19,100
is that it's a.

292
00:15:20,270 --> 00:15:23,090
But sometimes things change.
So for example,

293
00:15:23,091 --> 00:15:23,924
one of the cases I've worked on is the 
case of the Bengali bloggers and as a 

294
00:15:28,431 --> 00:15:31,850
result of we help publishing them at the
daily beast.

295
00:15:32,090 --> 00:15:32,923
They were able to give that article to 
the Swedish Embassy and received the 

296
00:15:36,021 --> 00:15:38,420
visa as a result because they told them 
like,

297
00:15:38,421 --> 00:15:40,670
look,
we are literally like publish it,

298
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:44,900
the mainstream media and,
and we are now in Sweden.

299
00:15:44,930 --> 00:15:45,763
So is there a risk in a case like that 
where these bloggers are writing in 

300
00:15:48,351 --> 00:15:49,184
Bangladesh where we know people are 
being killed for this just in the last 

301
00:15:51,890 --> 00:15:53,850
two weeks,
several people killed.

302
00:15:54,110 --> 00:15:54,943
Is there a risk that when you guys go 
ahead and publish that either on daily 

303
00:15:57,441 --> 00:15:58,760
beast or Huffington post or wherever it 
is,

304
00:15:59,090 --> 00:15:59,923
that that brings more attention to it so
that suddenly there's this new crop of 

305
00:16:02,721 --> 00:16:05,960
people that didn't even know about it 
that now now wants to kill them?

306
00:16:06,130 --> 00:16:07,520
I,
I wouldn't think so.

307
00:16:07,521 --> 00:16:08,810
I mean,
I mean as they say,

308
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:12,650
there is no such thing as half pregnant.
You're either pregnant or not.

309
00:16:12,990 --> 00:16:14,930
Is that when,
when you.

310
00:16:15,060 --> 00:16:19,490
I mean they're like a recent tweet by a 
group called Ansara Islam,

311
00:16:19,491 --> 00:16:20,324
which is the Al Qaeda affiliate in 
Southeast Asia and they actually 

312
00:16:24,260 --> 00:16:27,140
published all the names of the bloggers 
ask like.

313
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:30,430
So they actually stole our idea that 
crowdsourcing terrorism.

314
00:16:30,460 --> 00:16:32,320
Yeah.
So they like,

315
00:16:32,390 --> 00:16:34,780
it's the reverse.
If they got something,

316
00:16:34,810 --> 00:16:35,643
I got something there and they are 
crowdsourcing terrorism is that these 

317
00:16:38,541 --> 00:16:40,810
are the names of the bloggers and this 
and you should.

318
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:43,550
It's open source to everybody who wants 
to go and kill them.

319
00:16:43,551 --> 00:16:46,170
So many of us,
I mean it's,

320
00:16:46,270 --> 00:16:48,050
it's,
they're already under threat,

321
00:16:48,110 --> 00:16:48,943
so people,
when actually it's kind of helpful like 

322
00:16:52,170 --> 00:16:52,800
this,
I mean,

323
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:53,633
back to my case is that it helped me 
that I was published in the mainstream 

324
00:16:57,111 --> 00:17:02,111
media in terms of getting known and it 
will be easy for me to get a visa.

325
00:17:03,140 --> 00:17:06,290
So if you are only published within 
local news media,

326
00:17:06,350 --> 00:17:10,760
most of the people who like know about,
like the lawyers and the staff will not,

327
00:17:10,761 --> 00:17:12,260
will discount that.
They will say like,

328
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:13,273
oh,
we need something,

329
00:17:13,290 --> 00:17:16,770
we can show it to American authorities,
like they don't understand Bengali or,

330
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:18,500
or do any of that sort.
So,

331
00:17:18,860 --> 00:17:19,693
um,
so it is helpful to get published like 

332
00:17:23,150 --> 00:17:23,983
mainstream American media and all these 
writers in La that just want to get 

333
00:17:27,381 --> 00:17:28,214
published for.
So they get picked up by an agent and 

334
00:17:30,021 --> 00:17:32,060
you're dealing with the same thing.
They're just by,

335
00:17:32,090 --> 00:17:33,290
by language.
Yes.

336
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:35,130
Yes.
And and Mac,

337
00:17:35,190 --> 00:17:38,600
the concept of crowdsourcing is like,
so like in the case of Bengali,

338
00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:39,513
so,
so he said they send this article in 

339
00:17:41,030 --> 00:17:44,390
Bengali and there is another person 
translated Dr.

340
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:49,480
color from Bengali to English and there 
was another person as is article and all

341
00:17:49,561 --> 00:17:50,394
these people don't know each other,
everybody has a certain skill and then 

342
00:17:53,041 --> 00:17:53,880
there's the publisher.

343
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:56,730
So these three people work together and 
they don't know each other,

344
00:17:57,150 --> 00:17:57,983
help publishing the article and that 
helped that getting somebody out to 

345
00:18:01,411 --> 00:18:02,191
Sweden.
So.

346
00:18:02,191 --> 00:18:04,790
So that is.
So that's the concept of crowdsourcing.

347
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:08,730
Like everybody has a skill that they can
contribute collectively to great.

348
00:18:08,731 --> 00:18:09,750
A great result.
Right?

349
00:18:09,751 --> 00:18:12,390
So that's the beauty of it because 
people think of crowd funding and when I

350
00:18:12,391 --> 00:18:13,830
first went to the site and I was looking
around,

351
00:18:14,010 --> 00:18:15,450
I thought it was really just going to be
about money,

352
00:18:15,451 --> 00:18:16,284
like we're trying to raise x amount of 
dollars to get this person out of this 

353
00:18:19,201 --> 00:18:20,034
country.
But really it's about the skill set and 

354
00:18:22,111 --> 00:18:24,960
linking people that otherwise couldn't 
find each other.

355
00:18:25,050 --> 00:18:25,950
I for,
for,

356
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:29,100
for a case like we talked about in our 
Saudi Arabia,

357
00:18:29,101 --> 00:18:31,650
we like,
so we depended on partnerships,

358
00:18:31,651 --> 00:18:33,180
we're not actually the ones doing the 
job,

359
00:18:33,210 --> 00:18:36,780
but we could have the platform in which 
all these people work together.

360
00:18:36,780 --> 00:18:37,613
So the organization that did the crowd 
funding was called recovery from 

361
00:18:40,651 --> 00:18:42,150
religion,
which is like a,

362
00:18:42,780 --> 00:18:46,050
I think in Kansas or somewhere in the 
midwest.

363
00:18:46,070 --> 00:18:46,950
Uh,
and uh,

364
00:18:47,210 --> 00:18:51,000
there is the funds there and so all of 
us are connected together,

365
00:18:51,180 --> 00:18:54,720
so the funds go to their and their users
from movements and.

366
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:55,733
Yeah.
So it's like a circle of people working 

367
00:18:57,211 --> 00:18:58,710
together to get somebody out.
Yeah,

368
00:18:58,711 --> 00:19:01,110
it's incredible.
So in a case like this,

369
00:19:01,111 --> 00:19:04,650
like this one that we're talking about 
with Saudi Arabia where he had a.

370
00:19:04,840 --> 00:19:08,040
So he had an American passport.
So you had an actual American passport.

371
00:19:08,850 --> 00:19:09,683
Is this a case,
like why can't they just go to the 

372
00:19:10,981 --> 00:19:13,320
embassy then?
Why was he afraid to actually just go to

373
00:19:13,321 --> 00:19:15,030
the American embassy?
I mean,

374
00:19:15,031 --> 00:19:16,680
Saudi Arabia is supposed to be our big 
ally,

375
00:19:16,681 --> 00:19:17,580
right?
Yeah.

376
00:19:17,670 --> 00:19:18,900
That's what these guys.
Sure.

377
00:19:18,901 --> 00:19:20,760
Women can vote and all and can't drive.

378
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:22,810
But I'm not sure what the ally ward 
here.

379
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:24,780
Yeah.
So why,

380
00:19:24,810 --> 00:19:29,040
what would be the fear though of going 
to the US embassy and claiming asylum or

381
00:19:29,041 --> 00:19:30,690
something like that?
Yeah,

382
00:19:30,691 --> 00:19:31,630
I mean,
um,

383
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:32,873
I,
I don't think that the embassies give a 

384
00:19:36,070 --> 00:19:38,370
protections because he's like a Saudi 
citizen,

385
00:19:38,371 --> 00:19:41,520
an American citizen at the same time.
And um,

386
00:19:42,750 --> 00:19:44,790
I mean sometimes,
I mean even the,

387
00:19:45,140 --> 00:19:50,140
these cases of like other other folks,
the US embassy doesn't seem to give that

388
00:19:51,091 --> 00:19:53,910
much protection of from people 
persecuted by,

389
00:19:53,911 --> 00:19:56,070
as you said allies because allies,
right?

390
00:19:56,071 --> 00:19:57,940
So yeah.
So that's what it creates attention.

391
00:19:58,100 --> 00:19:58,933
So it's,
it's,

392
00:19:58,950 --> 00:19:59,783
it was a better for him,
I mean just to leave the country and go 

393
00:20:03,661 --> 00:20:04,494
to,
to say to the United States other than 

394
00:20:07,350 --> 00:20:08,183
get a safe haven and he,
I mean even if going to go to the US 

395
00:20:11,101 --> 00:20:12,990
embassy is gonna still be in Saudi 
Arabia.

396
00:20:12,990 --> 00:20:16,950
So you're going to still be stuck inside
the embassy.

397
00:20:17,010 --> 00:20:18,690
Do you have like a list of the 
countries?

398
00:20:18,691 --> 00:20:19,524
I mean,
I'm sure there's a master list of 

399
00:20:20,011 --> 00:20:22,290
countries that are close to you guys 
call them,

400
00:20:22,530 --> 00:20:23,363
but what are the countries that are 
really the most impossible for the 

401
00:20:26,611 --> 00:20:30,470
secular released or the free thinker or 
the atheists are all that yo?

402
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:31,050
Well,
I mean,

403
00:20:31,050 --> 00:20:33,190
what we depend on the definition of free
society.

404
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:35,640
Our society come from an organization 
called Freedom House,

405
00:20:35,850 --> 00:20:38,850
so freedom house trucks,
all the countries in terms of freedom of

406
00:20:38,851 --> 00:20:40,080
expression,
freedom of press,

407
00:20:40,081 --> 00:20:40,914
freedom of association.
So they have like all the countries and 

408
00:20:43,411 --> 00:20:48,340
they're trying to put a try to do 
reports on a basis to see which ones get

409
00:20:48,341 --> 00:20:49,600
advised.
So which one got worse?

410
00:20:49,900 --> 00:20:51,760
So I mean,
when it comes to the worst,

411
00:20:51,761 --> 00:20:54,490
I mean our to put Saudi Arabia as the 
worst.

412
00:20:54,930 --> 00:20:56,700
I get our allies,
our,

413
00:20:56,760 --> 00:20:57,490
yeah,
our,

414
00:20:57,490 --> 00:21:02,490
our favorite ally,
Saudi Arabia and Pakistan and Iran.

415
00:21:03,070 --> 00:21:05,200
I mean that's,
I call them the axis of evil.

416
00:21:05,230 --> 00:21:07,060
But uh,
so that's an.

417
00:21:07,150 --> 00:21:08,890
I mean obviously North Korea,
but that's,

418
00:21:09,010 --> 00:21:10,450
I mean it's,
it's,

419
00:21:10,451 --> 00:21:11,284
uh,
I mean being anything in North Korea is 

420
00:21:13,451 --> 00:21:14,284
a problem.
Whether that being a believer in the 

421
00:21:16,270 --> 00:21:19,150
supreme leader of the leader of North 
Korea.

422
00:21:19,151 --> 00:21:19,984
So,
so North Korea is probably like the 

423
00:21:22,360 --> 00:21:23,193
closest yet society we know we know of 
at the moment and I think there's a 

424
00:21:27,370 --> 00:21:31,540
Tajik start talking about Stan in 
Central Asia and uh,

425
00:21:31,860 --> 00:21:32,693
this is kind of like the most difficult 
and also it depends on the strength of 

426
00:21:36,450 --> 00:21:38,050
there's something called strength of the
passport.

427
00:21:38,051 --> 00:21:38,884
So like for example,
me as somebody who was an Iraqi Iraqi 

428
00:21:40,661 --> 00:21:41,494
passport doesn't get me anywhere.
Like there are only few countries that 

429
00:21:43,991 --> 00:21:47,590
get me in without a visa and that's the 
countries I went to Lebanon in Malaysia,

430
00:21:47,591 --> 00:21:48,424
like when I applied to United Kingdom 
they rejected me saying that they 

431
00:21:50,531 --> 00:21:51,364
require like thousands of pounds in my 
savings account and touch for six 

432
00:21:54,521 --> 00:21:55,210
months.

433
00:21:55,210 --> 00:21:56,043
So yeah really.
So it's very difficult for countries 

434
00:22:00,310 --> 00:22:01,660
that have,
that.

435
00:22:01,740 --> 00:22:02,573
They required a lot of,
like they require a visa for every 

436
00:22:04,331 --> 00:22:06,970
country they go to a to leave that 
country.

437
00:22:06,971 --> 00:22:07,804
But,
but for countries like which are in the 

438
00:22:09,731 --> 00:22:10,564
Gulf region,
sometimes it's easier for them to get a 

439
00:22:13,391 --> 00:22:15,760
visa elsewhere.
So there's,

440
00:22:15,950 --> 00:22:18,820
the passport also plays a role in how to
get people out.

441
00:22:18,910 --> 00:22:19,391
Yeah.
All right,

442
00:22:19,391 --> 00:22:21,070
well that's a perfect segue to your 
story,

443
00:22:21,071 --> 00:22:22,720
which is pretty great.
So you grew up,

444
00:22:22,721 --> 00:22:24,050
you were born,
interact and grew up in.

445
00:22:24,140 --> 00:22:25,050
Yes.
Uh,

446
00:22:25,060 --> 00:22:29,250
I guess we could now be referred to as 
the good old days under Saddam Hussein.

447
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:32,430
I think of them as the good old days 
kind of know right now.

448
00:22:32,770 --> 00:22:33,750
I mean,
uh,

449
00:22:33,950 --> 00:22:36,880
I mean it's surely,
I mean necessarily to use the word,

450
00:22:36,881 --> 00:22:39,650
it's like it's a cluster fuck.
I'm his dad.

451
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:40,330
It's okay.

452
00:22:40,330 --> 00:22:41,163
Yeah,
I mean I'm living at a living under 

453
00:22:43,961 --> 00:22:47,350
Saddam Hussein was,
was not really great.

454
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:48,233
I mean a w plus I was living under the 
sanctions when Saddam Hussein was the 

455
00:22:51,671 --> 00:22:53,410
president.
So it was two things.

456
00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:55,900
Those are two separate.
You had the regime itself?

457
00:22:55,930 --> 00:22:56,561
Yeah.
The regime.

458
00:22:56,561 --> 00:22:57,394
And you had the sanctioned,
sanctioned by the US and UK and 

459
00:22:59,621 --> 00:23:00,454
everybody.
Yeah.

460
00:23:00,610 --> 00:23:05,230
And I mean it's literally a prison 
living.

461
00:23:06,370 --> 00:23:07,203
What was it like,
uh,

462
00:23:07,240 --> 00:23:09,700
on any given day you're,
you're 13 years old,

463
00:23:09,701 --> 00:23:11,080
what was it like?
Oh,

464
00:23:11,081 --> 00:23:11,620
well,
um,

465
00:23:11,620 --> 00:23:14,110
I mean you see his pictures everywhere 
and you have to,

466
00:23:14,111 --> 00:23:14,944
like when,
when you go to classroom elementary 

467
00:23:16,301 --> 00:23:17,134
school,
you'll have to stand up and say long 

468
00:23:18,431 --> 00:23:19,510
lifts.
Saddam Hussein,

469
00:23:20,090 --> 00:23:20,923
when nine slash 11 happened,
he declared a holiday in the schools in 

470
00:23:23,891 --> 00:23:24,724
which my school was like praising the 
mujaheddin did nine slash 11 because he 

471
00:23:29,501 --> 00:23:31,870
started like the faith campaign after 
the Gulf War.

472
00:23:32,260 --> 00:23:33,093
That's what,
there's a lot of confusion in which 

473
00:23:34,061 --> 00:23:34,894
they,
they conserve Saddam Hussein to be a 

474
00:23:35,801 --> 00:23:38,560
secularist.
His secular as compared to isis.

475
00:23:38,561 --> 00:23:43,561
But that doesn't say much like probably 
al-Qaeda's secular comfort diocese.

476
00:23:45,590 --> 00:23:47,920
Was He really,
was he just using religion or was,

477
00:23:47,930 --> 00:23:50,600
did you think he actually believed.
I mean,

478
00:23:50,601 --> 00:23:51,830
uh,
it's,

479
00:23:52,100 --> 00:23:52,940
I,
I don't,

480
00:23:52,941 --> 00:23:56,080
I mean I'm not really good in 
psychoanalysis but um,

481
00:23:56,810 --> 00:24:01,550
I think that regardless of whether he 
was using it for his own benefit is like

482
00:24:01,551 --> 00:24:03,260
Iraq as secular as a.
sorry,

483
00:24:03,340 --> 00:24:04,173
a just society.
So using religion is definitely a 

484
00:24:06,611 --> 00:24:07,444
beneficial to all of the people.
It cannot use religion to Sweden for 

485
00:24:09,891 --> 00:24:12,900
example,
but you're definitely able to use it.

486
00:24:12,910 --> 00:24:15,830
Plus,
he built a lot of mosques and uh,

487
00:24:15,860 --> 00:24:19,490
and he was um,
also,

488
00:24:19,491 --> 00:24:19,850
I mean,
yeah,

489
00:24:19,850 --> 00:24:20,683
I mean since the Gulf War,
I mean he started waging jihad against 

490
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:24,913
the west and he start bringing people 
like almost opposite became the leader 

491
00:24:30,141 --> 00:24:34,430
of al Qaeda and was he came to Iraq and 
to like before the war.

492
00:24:34,430 --> 00:24:36,710
And so yeah,
I mean,

493
00:24:36,711 --> 00:24:38,300
um,
so for your life though,

494
00:24:38,301 --> 00:24:42,530
so you're 13 years old and what happened
when were you having your,

495
00:24:42,531 --> 00:24:45,620
sort of,
your secular awakening in yourself?

496
00:24:46,010 --> 00:24:47,020
Well,
I mean the,

497
00:24:47,040 --> 00:24:47,873
the lucky part of me is that I was 
raised in a certain sort of liberal 

498
00:24:51,201 --> 00:24:52,940
family.
I call them cafeteria Muslims.

499
00:24:53,020 --> 00:24:54,890
Um,
so my,

500
00:24:55,250 --> 00:24:57,600
my dad was like said like,
Oh,

501
00:24:57,601 --> 00:25:00,910
you can think for yourself.
And I was like,

502
00:25:00,950 --> 00:25:02,750
I was reading the Bible,
the Old Testament,

503
00:25:02,751 --> 00:25:04,520
the Torah,
the Telemundo and all of this stuff.

504
00:25:04,580 --> 00:25:08,840
And all of that copy of the Talmud.
And well the Internet is,

505
00:25:09,620 --> 00:25:10,453
even though it was like the Internet,
but there are some parts that you can 

506
00:25:12,381 --> 00:25:13,214
actually get online.
And I've seen that all of these 

507
00:25:16,340 --> 00:25:19,130
religions make objective of claims that 
have them being true.

508
00:25:19,460 --> 00:25:21,230
So I said,
okay,

509
00:25:21,231 --> 00:25:22,064
well either one of them is through or 
all of them are false and I moved like 

510
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:26,593
start reading more about science and I 
just realized that's probably like all 

511
00:25:30,081 --> 00:25:30,914
of them are false.

512
00:25:31,490 --> 00:25:32,323
But my,
I would say like my spark do activism 

513
00:25:34,850 --> 00:25:38,540
came in after the war.
I mean when the first elections happened

514
00:25:38,541 --> 00:25:43,541
in Iraq in 2005 and I was afraid of 
that.

515
00:25:44,301 --> 00:25:46,130
The sheer,
when they're going to take off the power

516
00:25:46,131 --> 00:25:47,070
that Islam is a,
she,

517
00:25:47,071 --> 00:25:47,904
I was going to take the power,
they're going to discriminate against 

518
00:25:49,700 --> 00:25:52,250
the Sundays and that would lead to a 
civil war and that.

519
00:25:52,251 --> 00:25:53,330
Exactly what happened.
I mean,

520
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:55,880
it's very sad to be right on this 
subject.

521
00:25:56,150 --> 00:25:59,000
A actually saw that coming.
You felt that?

522
00:25:59,030 --> 00:26:00,860
Yeah,
I mean it was very obvious.

523
00:26:00,861 --> 00:26:01,694
I mean the moment that Saddam Hussein 
fell down the moment is when the shit 

524
00:26:05,180 --> 00:26:06,013
starts getting more.
Like they start getting more mobilized 

525
00:26:08,871 --> 00:26:09,704
and you can see pictures of Ayatollah 
Sistani and mocked up the southern and 

526
00:26:12,711 --> 00:26:16,070
all of these little figures and it's 
very obvious this,

527
00:26:16,071 --> 00:26:17,210
these guys are sectarian.

528
00:26:17,270 --> 00:26:19,980
And uh,
so I,

529
00:26:20,780 --> 00:26:21,613
I said like,
well secularism is the literally the 

530
00:26:23,900 --> 00:26:27,740
solution is that try to make Sunni's and
equal under the law.

531
00:26:27,890 --> 00:26:30,380
And we seen,
we seen that success happening when,

532
00:26:30,650 --> 00:26:31,483
when the first prime minister I allow,
he was a secularist when he was the 

533
00:26:34,731 --> 00:26:35,564
prime minister.
There were much less sectarian warfare 

534
00:26:37,371 --> 00:26:38,204
happening,
but the moment where the election 

535
00:26:39,921 --> 00:26:43,920
happened is when Islam as part d sharp 
too one and,

536
00:26:44,250 --> 00:26:45,083
and w,
which is my biggest agreement with the 

537
00:26:47,190 --> 00:26:49,020
United States when it comes to you as 
management of the water,

538
00:26:49,021 --> 00:26:49,854
because I always thought that there was 
not qualified yet for our democracy and 

539
00:26:53,041 --> 00:26:53,874
there needs to be some sort of 
transitional period between building a 

540
00:26:57,181 --> 00:26:59,310
secular,
secular civil society and that will take

541
00:26:59,311 --> 00:27:01,470
some time.
And then you created election,

542
00:27:01,471 --> 00:27:02,304
not like after 40 years of dictatorship,
you would just make people who many of 

543
00:27:06,631 --> 00:27:07,464
them are illiterate,
would just go for a vote for the best 

544
00:27:09,601 --> 00:27:10,434
interests of Iraq.

545
00:27:10,770 --> 00:27:11,603
So when we've seen many instances of 
this as in Hamas was democratically 

546
00:27:15,211 --> 00:27:15,811
elected,
right?

547
00:27:15,811 --> 00:27:16,670
Yeah.
Yeah.

548
00:27:17,280 --> 00:27:18,113
The only example of a democratic is 
another example of the majority of 

549
00:27:21,961 --> 00:27:24,960
people because voted for,
for a Muslim Brotherhood.

550
00:27:25,380 --> 00:27:27,270
I mean one of the things of living under
a dictatorship,

551
00:27:27,271 --> 00:27:28,104
but what I've noticed is that 
dictatorships kill everybody with 

552
00:27:31,081 --> 00:27:33,570
disagree with them.
So people are left out,

553
00:27:34,010 --> 00:27:36,090
are the,
are the ones who don't care about life,

554
00:27:36,420 --> 00:27:37,253
so don't care about life that jihadists.
So dictatorships for a large extent 

555
00:27:41,761 --> 00:27:42,594
creates extra radical Muslims because 
they kill all the moderates and they 

556
00:27:47,321 --> 00:27:52,321
then give the people a false binary 
system is that either you want us or you

557
00:27:52,681 --> 00:27:56,190
want the terrorists and the same thing 
happening now in Syria.

558
00:27:56,220 --> 00:27:57,053
So like with Assad,
his and now with the Russian 

559
00:27:59,131 --> 00:28:00,900
intervention,
most of what they're killing our,

560
00:28:00,901 --> 00:28:02,670
the moderate troubles who are in the 
middle.

561
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:05,430
So when,
when they destroy the troubles,

562
00:28:05,610 --> 00:28:06,443
they're going to give the two choices 
you want us or isis and I can assure 

563
00:28:09,181 --> 00:28:10,590
you,
most people including myself,

564
00:28:10,591 --> 00:28:12,500
would choose us.
And,

565
00:28:13,250 --> 00:28:14,420
and,
and that is exempt.

566
00:28:14,430 --> 00:28:15,263
So dictatorships create extremism.
So what happens is that when these 

567
00:28:18,181 --> 00:28:19,014
dictatorships have go away,
they literally created like a hostage 

568
00:28:21,811 --> 00:28:22,644
crisis.
They created like a prison and you get 

569
00:28:24,330 --> 00:28:25,163
out of the prison and eventually you 
would have continuous sectarian warfare 

570
00:28:28,201 --> 00:28:29,034
and continuous like bad politics and 
America was obviously not very well 

571
00:28:34,771 --> 00:28:38,230
versed and dictatorship.
There were a lot of focus on like,

572
00:28:38,460 --> 00:28:39,293
let's get rid of Saddam Hussein,
but there was very little thinking of 

573
00:28:42,151 --> 00:28:43,590
what after,
which is bostic Taylor.

574
00:28:43,591 --> 00:28:46,650
She was much more important than just 
getting rid of the dictator.

575
00:28:46,710 --> 00:28:49,290
Right.
So where do you place or how much do you

576
00:28:49,291 --> 00:28:50,124
place the blame on the United States?
And I guess at that time it was a 

577
00:28:53,041 --> 00:28:53,874
coalition that or at least originally 
when of course it was mostly as because 

578
00:28:57,751 --> 00:28:58,584
I think most people in America now,
there's a real sense that it was the 

579
00:29:00,931 --> 00:29:03,960
wrong war to go to and they lied us into
the war and all that stuff,

580
00:29:03,961 --> 00:29:04,794
which I do it,
but the sense I'm getting from you is 

581
00:29:06,811 --> 00:29:07,644
that there was a ton of really bad stuff
going on there anyway and a lot of it 

582
00:29:11,431 --> 00:29:12,690
maybe would have bubbled up.

583
00:29:12,930 --> 00:29:13,763
Yeah,
I mean,

584
00:29:14,030 --> 00:29:16,260
I mean there are so many things that 
were like.

585
00:29:16,450 --> 00:29:17,930
I mean,
Islamic extremism is done,

586
00:29:17,950 --> 00:29:19,890
you it didn't,
it didn't start with,

587
00:29:20,050 --> 00:29:24,040
with the United States and then started 
with the CIA or Israel or the Mossad.

588
00:29:24,060 --> 00:29:28,590
So these things have been have been 
going on for hundreds of years.

589
00:29:28,591 --> 00:29:29,424
So they send their conflict.
I mean it started in Iraq and back at 

590
00:29:33,141 --> 00:29:34,000
the time,
I don't think it was called,

591
00:29:34,250 --> 00:29:37,160
but I mean now jeff and Kabbalah is 
where mom,

592
00:29:37,180 --> 00:29:38,013
Jose Hussein,
Ali were killed and that's where the 

593
00:29:39,211 --> 00:29:40,044
split between the Shia I think,
and then fast forward to the modern 

594
00:29:44,561 --> 00:29:45,394
history,
you got men empire who was at war with 

595
00:29:47,051 --> 00:29:51,340
the purchase of a weekend or the Persian
empire who are the and where the sun is.

596
00:29:51,490 --> 00:29:52,323
So the conflict has been going on for 
hundreds of years and all these 

597
00:29:54,761 --> 00:29:55,594
dictatorships and unsustainable.
Alexa was unsustainable and America did 

598
00:30:00,251 --> 00:30:03,790
not intervene in Syria until now,
recently after,

599
00:30:04,090 --> 00:30:05,680
after the Messiah came back.

600
00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:09,430
Is that,
is that still.

601
00:30:09,431 --> 00:30:10,264
They still had the civil war between 
Sunnis and Shias and they still had to 

602
00:30:13,140 --> 00:30:16,180
isis and al Qaeda and all of that stuff.
So it's,

603
00:30:16,230 --> 00:30:17,140
it's true.
I mean,

604
00:30:17,710 --> 00:30:18,543
I never thought that.
I'd never think that the United States 

605
00:30:20,681 --> 00:30:21,514
is the root of our problems obviously,
but I think sometimes that the United 

606
00:30:24,700 --> 00:30:25,533
States,
if some policies need to be applied 

607
00:30:28,270 --> 00:30:29,103
based upon the understanding of the 
region that kind of prevent or reduce 

608
00:30:32,980 --> 00:30:33,813
amount of sectarian violence and that in
my opinion was to keep some sort of 

609
00:30:37,720 --> 00:30:42,580
transitional secular regime that can 
build a civil society that can reduce.

610
00:30:42,581 --> 00:30:44,260
I'm obviously it's not going to 
eliminate a stickler.

611
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:45,633
So basically.
So basically if you had had a time 

612
00:30:46,931 --> 00:30:47,764
machine you would have gone back to 
right around the elections when they 

613
00:30:50,471 --> 00:30:52,290
finally had the free elections.
Yeah.

614
00:30:52,370 --> 00:30:54,280
And then you would have just sort of 
either.

615
00:30:54,310 --> 00:30:55,143
So you would have wanted either American
troops are saying they're to stay just 

616
00:30:57,761 --> 00:31:01,270
to stabilize it a little bit longer and 
yet at the same time as an American,

617
00:31:01,271 --> 00:31:05,470
even though I know it's all gotten worse
in these last three years since we out,

618
00:31:05,890 --> 00:31:07,780
we didn't want to stay there either.
And that's.

619
00:31:08,190 --> 00:31:09,023
I mean,
I mean,

620
00:31:09,150 --> 00:31:09,983
and the thing that I always go like 
conversation with neoconservatives and 

621
00:31:13,751 --> 00:31:16,200
things of,
of people who believe consumers,

622
00:31:16,560 --> 00:31:17,393
aggressive foreign policy is that is it 
doesn't fit in with the American 

623
00:31:20,471 --> 00:31:22,540
political system is like an American 
political ecosystem.

624
00:31:22,541 --> 00:31:25,300
You have elections every four years and 
like nation building,

625
00:31:25,301 --> 00:31:27,010
you're talking about the Middle East in 
which is,

626
00:31:27,280 --> 00:31:29,080
which doesn't get done in four years.
It does.

627
00:31:29,090 --> 00:31:31,420
Obviously it doesn't get probably 40 
years,

628
00:31:31,421 --> 00:31:32,254
so.
So it is unsustainable to have like a 

629
00:31:34,351 --> 00:31:35,184
political system in which the president 
has to change every four years and 

630
00:31:38,020 --> 00:31:38,853
nation building,
especially in the region that is very 

631
00:31:40,691 --> 00:31:41,524
different,
let's say like Germany during World War 

632
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:45,670
Two,
after World War Two and Japan as that.

633
00:31:46,180 --> 00:31:50,000
Iraq is literally in.
It has the worst neighborhood ever have.

634
00:31:50,170 --> 00:31:52,030
You have Saudi Arabia,
which is the,

635
00:31:52,210 --> 00:31:53,043
which is the rule of the Wahabi regime 
that's not that different from Isis and 

636
00:31:57,071 --> 00:31:59,140
you have Iran on,
on the east,

637
00:31:59,470 --> 00:32:04,470
that is the mother lode of Shia Islam 
and the is in the middle between between

638
00:32:07,180 --> 00:32:08,013
and America was expecting like,
so come to Iraq and create a liberal 

639
00:32:12,191 --> 00:32:17,191
democracy in the middle of all regimes 
that are theocratic,

640
00:32:17,290 --> 00:32:19,600
that don't believe in liberal democracy 
and,

641
00:32:19,750 --> 00:32:22,150
and one of them is an ally,
which is kind of ironic,

642
00:32:22,151 --> 00:32:24,760
is like,
so they try like now with the city,

643
00:32:24,761 --> 00:32:28,300
they tried to work with non democratic 
countries to create a democracy.

644
00:32:29,970 --> 00:32:31,930
I mean it makes no sense.
Makes no sense.

645
00:32:32,010 --> 00:32:36,900
It's like the idea that Saudi Arabia or 
Qatar or,

646
00:32:36,901 --> 00:32:41,720
or even Iran would allow a liberal 
democracy to flourish in Syria and Iraq.

647
00:32:41,720 --> 00:32:42,553
It's a pure delusion.
They're not that thrilled with the one 

648
00:32:44,331 --> 00:32:45,860
liberal democracy that's in the 
neighborhood.

649
00:32:45,861 --> 00:32:46,760
Right?
Yeah.

650
00:32:46,761 --> 00:32:47,450
I mean,
well,

651
00:32:47,450 --> 00:32:48,720
let's hope it stays.
I mean,

652
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:51,170
it seems to.
Seems like Israel is going,

653
00:32:51,680 --> 00:32:52,750
uh,
I mean as,

654
00:32:52,800 --> 00:32:53,633
as I can see is that there's a lot of 
elements of theocratic a leaderships is 

655
00:32:58,881 --> 00:33:00,500
now rising up in Israel,
which is,

656
00:33:00,770 --> 00:33:01,603
which may,
which I don't think I don't see Israel 

657
00:33:04,021 --> 00:33:04,854
content.
I mean I hope it's going to continue to 

658
00:33:05,661 --> 00:33:06,494
be liberal democracy,
but I see there are a lot of elements 

659
00:33:08,571 --> 00:33:10,710
that may not be in the future.
Yeah.

660
00:33:10,850 --> 00:33:11,683
So against theocratic dictatorships and 
theocratic routines regardless of 

661
00:33:15,831 --> 00:33:16,910
religion.
Of course.

662
00:33:18,040 --> 00:33:20,120
A lot of people,
I think when I've seen,

663
00:33:20,121 --> 00:33:23,260
I've watched things with you on Youtube 
where people will attack you for,

664
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:27,680
they'll attack you being Islamophobic or
that you are attacking Islam or.

665
00:33:27,681 --> 00:33:29,090
But clearly that's not the case.

666
00:33:29,090 --> 00:33:29,721
Yeah,
I mean,

667
00:33:29,721 --> 00:33:33,420
I mean the fact of the matter is like 
you cannot see,

668
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:36,050
you cannot criticize Islam and Muslim 
countries.

669
00:33:36,560 --> 00:33:40,580
So even here in the west they created 
some sort of like catch 22.

670
00:33:40,820 --> 00:33:43,610
So if somebody is a,
as a white person,

671
00:33:43,650 --> 00:33:44,483
like somehow.
So they immediately get attack him as 

672
00:33:46,461 --> 00:33:47,294
cisgender white male was of interesting 
to hear to from like Muslims who don't 

673
00:33:50,691 --> 00:33:55,310
believe in science and so there.
But if you had to,

674
00:33:55,370 --> 00:33:56,203
if somebody like me who is from the 
Middle East looking to attack him as 

675
00:33:59,060 --> 00:34:01,370
some sort of uncle,
tall mass murderer.

676
00:34:01,520 --> 00:34:03,950
So they kind of catch 22.
Is that in,

677
00:34:04,140 --> 00:34:05,450
in the middle,
in the Muslim world,

678
00:34:05,451 --> 00:34:07,850
you cannot criticize Islam and if you do
it in the West,

679
00:34:08,120 --> 00:34:12,260
you will be credited,
you will be labeled immediately as a,

680
00:34:12,620 --> 00:34:15,140
as some sort of greater as a trader.
Right.

681
00:34:15,141 --> 00:34:17,000
So this is an incredible thing to me.

682
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:19,700
So I've had my new eyes on obviously.
Yeah.

683
00:34:19,880 --> 00:34:20,511
I think,
you know,

684
00:34:20,511 --> 00:34:21,021
magic,
right?

685
00:34:21,021 --> 00:34:23,720
I am an acknowledgement of his latest 
book.

686
00:34:23,721 --> 00:34:24,980
So,
uh,

687
00:34:24,981 --> 00:34:25,371
so,
you know,

688
00:34:25,371 --> 00:34:26,210
have a little bit.
Um,

689
00:34:26,420 --> 00:34:29,820
and he gets this all the time.
He gets it more than I do.

690
00:34:29,821 --> 00:34:33,800
I think that he's a trader or he's an 
uncle tom or he's a porch monkey.

691
00:34:33,801 --> 00:34:35,090
I mean these guys.
And again,

692
00:34:36,140 --> 00:34:36,973
we've talked about this a lot,
but this is coming from people on the 

693
00:34:38,511 --> 00:34:39,344
left.
So what I don't understand is if you 

694
00:34:40,161 --> 00:34:44,570
believe in liberal values and you want 
women to be free and you want gay people

695
00:34:44,571 --> 00:34:48,740
to be free and all those things and you 
want a quality for everybody,

696
00:34:49,340 --> 00:34:50,173
how do they expect to get it?
If not through people like you and 

697
00:34:53,281 --> 00:34:54,050
Magid.
Forget.

698
00:34:54,050 --> 00:34:55,040
Forget Sam.
Okay.

699
00:34:55,041 --> 00:34:57,260
They want to throw him under the bus.
What?

700
00:34:58,480 --> 00:35:01,010
He's a great guy.
Of course I'm not for that,

701
00:35:01,530 --> 00:35:03,050
but what I'm saying is if they want to 
just remove,

702
00:35:03,051 --> 00:35:05,840
they want to use their own version of 
bigotry to remove him.

703
00:35:06,290 --> 00:35:07,400
White Guy,
fine.

704
00:35:07,401 --> 00:35:08,234
But then wouldn't they look at someone 
like you that stands up for all those 

705
00:35:10,761 --> 00:35:15,050
values on the left and say,
this is a guy he survived living.

706
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:16,313
Sit down.
He now fights to make his country and 

707
00:35:18,771 --> 00:35:19,604
those other countries stand up for the 
very values that we as progressives say 

708
00:35:23,001 --> 00:35:23,834
we're full.
And yet you don't get support out of 

709
00:35:25,401 --> 00:35:26,234
these guys,
do you?

710
00:35:26,620 --> 00:35:27,061
I mean,
I,

711
00:35:27,061 --> 00:35:28,550
I do get some but.
But I,

712
00:35:28,551 --> 00:35:29,384
I know what you're referring to is that 
the regressive left as much as no one 

713
00:35:31,851 --> 00:35:32,481
was.
Yeah,

714
00:35:32,481 --> 00:35:33,314
I mean it's very interesting.
I called the unholy alliance that 

715
00:35:36,021 --> 00:35:41,021
happened between the liberal left and 
the Muslim rights against the,

716
00:35:42,890 --> 00:35:46,140
the or Muslim or secular left in the 
Arab world.

717
00:35:46,590 --> 00:35:47,423
And uh,
so ironically the secular left just to 

718
00:35:50,641 --> 00:35:54,420
put that altogether,
the secular left is actually lined up in

719
00:35:54,421 --> 00:35:57,240
a weird way with the conservative,
the conservative.

720
00:35:57,250 --> 00:35:59,080
Right.
Which is very.

721
00:35:59,640 --> 00:36:01,260
Yeah,
it is extremely,

722
00:36:01,290 --> 00:36:02,640
uh,
I mean they don't,

723
00:36:02,660 --> 00:36:06,210
they don't say it very publicly,
but the fact of the matter,

724
00:36:06,211 --> 00:36:09,560
I mean they apply extreme different 
standards too.

725
00:36:09,660 --> 00:36:10,493
And I was speaking at UC Berkeley before
I came here and I've had some debates 

726
00:36:14,101 --> 00:36:16,600
and in northern California and I told 
him,

727
00:36:16,601 --> 00:36:17,434
I'm like,
what do you call a conservative 

728
00:36:18,631 --> 00:36:21,030
Republican who is against gay marriage?
And he said,

729
00:36:21,031 --> 00:36:24,810
I call him a bigot,
that he thank you for calling 90 percent

730
00:36:24,811 --> 00:36:26,430
of Muslims bigots.
They said,

731
00:36:26,431 --> 00:36:27,810
I never said that.
Right.

732
00:36:27,870 --> 00:36:28,703
Okay.
Then I told him if you apply different 

733
00:36:31,081 --> 00:36:31,914
standards to different people based upon
their race and because they think that 

734
00:36:35,251 --> 00:36:36,830
Muslim is the brown technically,
right.

735
00:36:36,850 --> 00:36:38,710
If you're not even raised,
uh,

736
00:36:38,980 --> 00:36:40,980
if you have a few,
apply different people,

737
00:36:41,210 --> 00:36:42,780
different sizes of,
based upon their race,

738
00:36:42,781 --> 00:36:45,810
then you are actually a racist.
And this,

739
00:36:45,820 --> 00:36:49,940
this form of racism is sometimes get 
get.

740
00:36:49,941 --> 00:36:52,620
Um,
because most of the racism we talk about

741
00:36:52,621 --> 00:36:53,454
is like the KKK.
And the fact of the matter is that they 

742
00:36:55,801 --> 00:36:57,180
agree.
So like when,

743
00:36:57,210 --> 00:36:58,800
when somebody like the Charleston 
shooting,

744
00:36:58,801 --> 00:37:03,120
the one habit in South Carolina is that 
the guy said I'm motivated by racism,

745
00:37:03,150 --> 00:37:05,980
and they immediately took him for his 
word and they're true.

746
00:37:06,450 --> 00:37:07,283
They're right there.
He's this guy who was motivated by 

747
00:37:08,551 --> 00:37:12,330
racism but replace,
replace this guy by Isis.

748
00:37:12,840 --> 00:37:13,673
And Isis says,
I am literally motivated by this 

749
00:37:16,501 --> 00:37:17,334
interpretation of Islam.
The same guys who said that this game 

750
00:37:19,861 --> 00:37:21,180
was believable.
Racism will say,

751
00:37:21,181 --> 00:37:21,691
no,
no,

752
00:37:21,691 --> 00:37:23,590
this thing has ulterior motives,
right?

753
00:37:23,710 --> 00:37:26,910
It must be avoided.
Economics and foreign policy or politics

754
00:37:26,940 --> 00:37:29,940
and George W Bush and Dick Cheney and,
and the Olympian,

755
00:37:29,980 --> 00:37:30,813
older,
they create the solid of everybody they 

756
00:37:32,341 --> 00:37:34,410
hate and they put him in one category.

757
00:37:34,500 --> 00:37:37,910
And so,
so you see like the double standards,

758
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:39,950
extremely obvious.
And uh,

759
00:37:40,290 --> 00:37:41,123
so as a result of that they can,
you created a smokescreen for apologist 

760
00:37:45,751 --> 00:37:46,341
and,
and,

761
00:37:46,341 --> 00:37:47,174
and even extremists to flourish in,
in like people like me have to fight 

762
00:37:51,331 --> 00:37:55,530
against the religious right and the far 
right in the United States who,

763
00:37:55,630 --> 00:37:58,830
who consider me like inferior human 
being,

764
00:37:58,970 --> 00:38:01,410
right and,
and yeah,

765
00:38:01,460 --> 00:38:04,320
and have to fight the religious right in
my own country.

766
00:38:04,321 --> 00:38:05,220
That was lovely,
cried.

767
00:38:05,250 --> 00:38:07,590
And then I have to find the apologists 
left.

768
00:38:07,860 --> 00:38:11,970
So like they created extra France for 
and they,

769
00:38:12,570 --> 00:38:13,403
they have made it very much,
very much difficult for people like 

770
00:38:16,561 --> 00:38:17,394
Majid Nawaz and many people who are 
reformers to actually even have the 

771
00:38:22,411 --> 00:38:23,244
discussion to begin with because they 
don't think there is any discussion to 

772
00:38:25,991 --> 00:38:30,330
be had and it's all about us foreign 
policy and they always try to divert.

773
00:38:30,331 --> 00:38:33,370
The discussion is all about America.
It's all about America.

774
00:38:33,390 --> 00:38:36,190
And notice now,
now that I've more of these people

775
00:38:36,190 --> 00:38:37,023
on twitter and there's probably a good,
maybe 40 people like yourself that are 

776
00:38:40,661 --> 00:38:41,494
trying to reform and coming from these 
countries and trying to make things 

777
00:38:43,661 --> 00:38:44,494
better.
I see people like you tweeting about 

778
00:38:46,811 --> 00:38:47,644
coexistence,
tweeting about how do we make things 

779
00:38:48,971 --> 00:38:49,690
better.
All that.

780
00:38:49,690 --> 00:38:52,130
And I never see it from the regressives 
I,

781
00:38:52,180 --> 00:38:53,013
yeah.
They always are screaming about foreign 

782
00:38:55,061 --> 00:38:57,550
policy or whatever it is,
defending our foreign policy.

783
00:38:57,551 --> 00:39:00,160
That's,
that's not a binary system.

784
00:39:00,190 --> 00:39:04,390
It's not a binary and yet.
So what is the angle?

785
00:39:04,391 --> 00:39:05,224
What is it that they're throwing back at
you that they can't get behind what 

786
00:39:07,481 --> 00:39:09,100
you're doing?
Yeah,

787
00:39:09,101 --> 00:39:11,300
I mean,
I mean they think that

788
00:39:11,400 --> 00:39:12,233
the biggest problem.
So they see the world's consumption of 

789
00:39:15,420 --> 00:39:16,253
like a pyramid.
So the biggest problem in this world is 

790
00:39:19,470 --> 00:39:22,290
cisgender white,
male capitalist,

791
00:39:22,470 --> 00:39:24,810
rich.
And then we actually defined cisgender.

792
00:39:24,811 --> 00:39:26,530
I didn't know what it was until about a 
month ago.

793
00:39:26,550 --> 00:39:27,383
I made two.
I got to because I got to talk to 

794
00:39:29,391 --> 00:39:32,430
because of it is as a cisgender because 
I'm cisgender.

795
00:39:32,510 --> 00:39:32,940
Yeah.

796
00:39:32,940 --> 00:39:36,150
It means that you were born at the 
gender that you're central.

797
00:39:36,430 --> 00:39:37,720
Yeah.
And that's now a privilege.

798
00:39:38,120 --> 00:39:38,953
And I was like,
I come from Iraq and my brother was 

799
00:39:40,931 --> 00:39:42,440
killed and I told him that I'm 
privileged,

800
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:43,810
but anyway,
so they,

801
00:39:43,811 --> 00:39:46,900
they,
they have this pyramid in which there is

802
00:39:47,080 --> 00:39:51,160
a,
they see the world based upon like race,

803
00:39:51,161 --> 00:39:52,360
gender,
and,

804
00:39:52,390 --> 00:39:53,223
and financial privilege.
And they think that the biggest problem 

805
00:39:56,231 --> 00:40:00,190
in this planet is western capitalism.
And uh,

806
00:40:00,670 --> 00:40:04,360
they link everything unleash,
walled into.

807
00:40:04,361 --> 00:40:05,194
It's a very American centric point of 
view is that they link everything 

808
00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:10,390
problem in this world as a problem of 
so.

809
00:40:10,510 --> 00:40:11,740
So if,
if a,

810
00:40:11,850 --> 00:40:12,683
if a brown person and from Pakistan 
wants to blow himself up to say to 

811
00:40:17,081 --> 00:40:17,914
defend Jerusalem coat and a quote,
they will say that this is as a result 

812
00:40:21,790 --> 00:40:22,623
of imperialism happening by the military
industrial complex connected to western 

813
00:40:27,281 --> 00:40:28,114
capitalism.
So they always lump everything to that 

814
00:40:31,750 --> 00:40:33,850
and everything is an expression of 
grievances.

815
00:40:33,850 --> 00:40:35,470
So like you say,
somebody is like,

816
00:40:35,620 --> 00:40:37,320
I hate Jews.
And they say like,

817
00:40:37,480 --> 00:40:39,910
well,
I mean he doesn't actually hate Jews,

818
00:40:40,090 --> 00:40:44,980
but that is his language to express his 
first ration with American imperialism.

819
00:40:45,230 --> 00:40:46,063
So.
So they always link everything back to 

820
00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:49,880
that.
Is there a,

821
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:50,833
is there the point is like,
and then I can tell people like nom 

822
00:40:53,811 --> 00:40:56,560
chomsky was like the head of the,
of the movement.

823
00:40:56,561 --> 00:40:57,394
I would say I would have them on,
but I don't think he'd like to talk to 

824
00:41:00,011 --> 00:41:02,170
someone smarter than him.
Well,

825
00:41:02,220 --> 00:41:04,070
I mean the.
I mean it's,

826
00:41:04,180 --> 00:41:05,013
I don't think it's,
I mean Sam tried to engage with him and 

827
00:41:07,271 --> 00:41:09,700
I don't think it's,
it's a,

828
00:41:09,701 --> 00:41:13,240
you can actually have a conversation is 
that it's.

829
00:41:13,300 --> 00:41:14,133
I mean they,
they seem to subscribe to a specific 

830
00:41:17,051 --> 00:41:17,884
dog.
Like I always tried to like make the 

831
00:41:20,620 --> 00:41:21,453
best of my friends that I can like 
predict what Chomsky is going to write 

832
00:41:24,340 --> 00:41:26,740
just by seeing the title of the article.

833
00:41:26,740 --> 00:41:29,980
So I like I make five points.
I say this is what Tom says going to say

834
00:41:29,981 --> 00:41:32,020
in the,
in this paragraph and this paragraph.

835
00:41:32,080 --> 00:41:34,880
And I always like get my $50 because I 
with them,

836
00:41:35,210 --> 00:41:36,043
I'm like,
what exactly Chomsky is going to say 

837
00:41:38,151 --> 00:41:40,760
that is about American imperialism is 
going to say it's about the grievance.

838
00:41:40,761 --> 00:41:41,594
This is going to say about capitalism 
and all his like you don't need to read 

839
00:41:44,301 --> 00:41:47,150
all his books even though I've read 
quite a lot,

840
00:41:47,180 --> 00:41:50,860
but it seems like I've read two books 
and all the rest were like,

841
00:41:50,890 --> 00:41:51,723
just subscribe to the same.
So is that the danger of these guys 

842
00:41:55,101 --> 00:41:55,934
because what they're doing,
even if a certain percentage of what 

843
00:41:58,791 --> 00:42:00,650
they're saying is right about American 
foreign policy.

844
00:42:00,651 --> 00:42:02,580
I had Douglas Murray on last week.
Yeah.

845
00:42:02,630 --> 00:42:05,720
Who I thought really said something that
I'd never thought of before,

846
00:42:05,870 --> 00:42:07,160
which was that he said,
you know,

847
00:42:07,161 --> 00:42:09,470
you Americans always think everything's 
about you.

848
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:11,840
So what you're saying that's what these 
guys are doing,

849
00:42:12,110 --> 00:42:15,460
but let's just say a certain percentage.
I mean it's half truths.

850
00:42:15,470 --> 00:42:16,880
I mean,
I mean many of them.

851
00:42:16,881 --> 00:42:18,230
I mean look at,
for example,

852
00:42:18,590 --> 00:42:22,040
what some apologists say,
is that what they say?

853
00:42:22,041 --> 00:42:24,380
Like the majority of Muslims don't 
support Isis.

854
00:42:24,440 --> 00:42:28,730
This is true,
but it also doesn't support Isis.

855
00:42:28,731 --> 00:42:31,520
So the question is,
do you support Isis?

856
00:42:31,820 --> 00:42:33,770
Are Not saying not,
doesn't meet,

857
00:42:33,860 --> 00:42:35,450
move you to the moderate.
Yeah.

858
00:42:35,510 --> 00:42:40,510
You can subscribe to a lot of beliefs 
that I said you agree with Isis with and

859
00:42:40,851 --> 00:42:41,950
you don't need the support.
I says,

860
00:42:41,990 --> 00:42:43,130
for example,
Ayatollah Khomeini,

861
00:42:43,310 --> 00:42:45,380
harmony and all of the ayatollahs in 
Iran,

862
00:42:45,540 --> 00:42:46,373
they disagree with Isis,
but if you look at how they treat gays 

863
00:42:49,041 --> 00:42:51,830
in Iran is not that much different than 
Isis,

864
00:42:51,950 --> 00:42:54,830
so like the disagreement,
they tell you a truth,

865
00:42:54,831 --> 00:42:56,930
which is the majority of Muslims don't 
agree with Isis,

866
00:42:57,080 --> 00:42:57,913
which is true,
but that's true if they don't tell you 

867
00:43:00,170 --> 00:43:01,003
that there's a significant amount of 
Egyptians and Pakistanis and and and so 

868
00:43:05,241 --> 00:43:07,340
many countries around the Muslim world,
that thing,

869
00:43:07,341 --> 00:43:12,341
that penalty apostasy should be death,
which is so I think like the purest that

870
00:43:13,070 --> 00:43:17,360
has been done on like shutting on what 
Muslims believe and I asked everybody to

871
00:43:17,361 --> 00:43:17,540
read.

872
00:43:17,540 --> 00:43:21,230
It was very intelligent because it asks 
specific questions.

873
00:43:21,440 --> 00:43:23,170
It doesn't.
People ask people like,

874
00:43:23,330 --> 00:43:24,800
Oh,
do you support isis or not?

875
00:43:24,801 --> 00:43:28,370
So this nine slash 11 or not.
But they ask him like no questions.

876
00:43:28,371 --> 00:43:29,204
Do you think that suicide bombing is a,
is an appropriate way of dealing with 

877
00:43:33,141 --> 00:43:36,050
grievances and they use a significant 
amount of saying yes,

878
00:43:36,470 --> 00:43:37,303
and do you think it should be allowed of
killing these people who conspired with 

879
00:43:40,080 --> 00:43:40,913
new Americans?
And the Israelis will say yes and a 

880
00:43:44,200 --> 00:43:46,730
significant bonds will say yes.
So show that.

881
00:43:46,760 --> 00:43:49,160
So when somebody says so,
all of these things,

882
00:43:49,190 --> 00:43:51,200
even though some of the parts are true,
I mean,

883
00:43:51,220 --> 00:43:51,831
as I said,
look,

884
00:43:51,831 --> 00:43:55,470
I got us foreign policy in Iraq has not 
been very great and uh,

885
00:43:55,790 --> 00:43:56,623
just say the least and there are so many
things that should have been done that 

886
00:43:59,301 --> 00:44:00,170
have not been done.

887
00:44:00,290 --> 00:44:02,330
And uh,
so yes,

888
00:44:02,520 --> 00:44:05,360
United States foreign policy have a,
played a role in,

889
00:44:06,310 --> 00:44:07,143
in,
in rise of the extremist in the Middle 

890
00:44:08,360 --> 00:44:09,680
East,
but they're not the root of the problem.

891
00:44:09,681 --> 00:44:13,950
There is a huge difference between.
And there isn't like it was kind of very

892
00:44:13,951 --> 00:44:16,910
ironic.
It's like the moment they agree,

893
00:44:17,190 --> 00:44:18,023
like for example,
the abortion clinics that had happened 

894
00:44:20,781 --> 00:44:21,614
in United States,
they agreed that this is a result of 

895
00:44:23,661 --> 00:44:24,990
religious fundamentalism,
right?

896
00:44:25,160 --> 00:44:25,993
Many of the Liberals agree that Mike 
Huckabee and Ted Cruz and all of these 

897
00:44:30,171 --> 00:44:31,004
folks are motivated,
are Christian fundamentalists and they 

898
00:44:33,571 --> 00:44:36,750
are worried about them because they're a
Christian fundamentalist,

899
00:44:37,050 --> 00:44:40,830
but the moment that this discussion goes
into Islam,

900
00:44:41,190 --> 00:44:42,023
the moment that know the root of the 
fundamentalist has nothing to do with 

901
00:44:44,791 --> 00:44:45,624
the tags,
has nothing to do with interpretation 

902
00:44:46,770 --> 00:44:50,070
and it's all about us.
It's immediately goes back and it's very

903
00:44:50,071 --> 00:44:50,904
self center like egotistical point of 
view is that everything is about the 

904
00:44:54,240 --> 00:44:54,300
United States.

905
00:44:54,300 --> 00:44:55,133
It's not solving anything.
I mean I think that's actually a very 

906
00:44:57,841 --> 00:44:58,674
dangerous as you mentioned,
because they are giving a free pass to 

907
00:45:01,321 --> 00:45:04,950
these people that me and others who are 
fighting on a daily basis,

908
00:45:04,951 --> 00:45:08,640
they were fighting against the theocrats
in our countries and and,

909
00:45:08,670 --> 00:45:09,503
and the,
the regressive light has given these 

910
00:45:12,360 --> 00:45:15,220
people a free pass to telling them,
well,

911
00:45:15,290 --> 00:45:17,160
it's nothing to do with.
It's all about us.

912
00:45:17,180 --> 00:45:18,900
Do you think they consciously aware of 
it?

913
00:45:18,901 --> 00:45:19,734
Because I,
I've sort of struggled with this 

914
00:45:20,341 --> 00:45:21,930
question a bit and when I've talked to 
people,

915
00:45:22,080 --> 00:45:22,913
I think a lot of people.
I think Sam at this point thinks that 

916
00:45:24,841 --> 00:45:26,750
they're fully malicious in what they're 
doing.

917
00:45:27,020 --> 00:45:27,853
I pretty much think so too,
but I want to give some of these guys a 

918
00:45:30,571 --> 00:45:33,360
little of the benefit of the doubt that 
they're not doing this maliciously.

919
00:45:33,900 --> 00:45:35,910
I mean,
it depends on,

920
00:45:35,950 --> 00:45:37,560
on who are we talking about?

921
00:45:37,680 --> 00:45:38,790
Um,
I,

922
00:45:38,960 --> 00:45:42,090
I mean I think we need to mention names 
here because every.

923
00:45:42,170 --> 00:45:44,580
I did want to mention names,
but the.

924
00:45:44,581 --> 00:45:44,840
I mean,
I,

925
00:45:44,840 --> 00:45:45,673
I think that people like Nam Chomsky and
Frankenstein and some folks now I'm a 

926
00:45:48,810 --> 00:45:49,643
client I think are motivated by an 
ideology that they actually cared about 

927
00:45:54,210 --> 00:45:55,043
which is left libertarianism,
anarchism against United States 

928
00:45:59,520 --> 00:46:00,353
capitalism and things of that sort.
There are people who are completely 

929
00:46:03,721 --> 00:46:07,110
disingenuous and completely dishonest 
and they would,

930
00:46:07,980 --> 00:46:10,740
Mr presents all of other people's views 
like I was.

931
00:46:11,010 --> 00:46:11,770
I was,
I think.

932
00:46:11,770 --> 00:46:14,930
I think all my viewers probably know the
names that you're going.

933
00:46:15,830 --> 00:46:18,660
There are people who like,
like for example,

934
00:46:18,661 --> 00:46:19,494
I had a debate on which was featured on 
NPR Wy and see I bought Islamophobia in 

935
00:46:22,981 --> 00:46:26,880
New York City and I said there are 
progressive Muslims,

936
00:46:27,420 --> 00:46:28,253
moderate Muslims,
conservative Muslims and extremists and 

937
00:46:31,550 --> 00:46:35,130
they our attacked as being generalizing 
on Muslims and I said,

938
00:46:35,490 --> 00:46:37,320
that is exactly what I didn't do.

939
00:46:37,500 --> 00:46:38,333
Is that the,
that the statistics and the research is 

940
00:46:40,891 --> 00:46:41,724
being done.
It's to avoid generalizations is when 

941
00:46:43,711 --> 00:46:47,430
you say there's like 40 percent of 
Americans believe in creationism.

942
00:46:47,690 --> 00:46:49,890
You are literally saying that 60 percent
of them don't.

943
00:46:49,920 --> 00:46:51,810
That is,
you're not generalizing on Americans,

944
00:46:52,080 --> 00:46:52,913
but I kept repeating the same statement 
and they kept saying that you are 

945
00:46:55,831 --> 00:46:56,664
generalizing all Muslims as extremists.
And I kept repeating and they kept 

946
00:47:00,481 --> 00:47:04,690
saying the same thing and then they,
they go in and,

947
00:47:04,691 --> 00:47:05,524
and,
and take something out of context and 

948
00:47:07,411 --> 00:47:10,380
then they put that in a meme and shared 
it on social media.

949
00:47:10,650 --> 00:47:14,700
And somehow I started getting attack as 
we generalizing all Muslims,

950
00:47:14,880 --> 00:47:17,550
which is completely disingenuous.
So I mean,

951
00:47:18,690 --> 00:47:19,523
what Sam has been dealing with is pretty
much what many of us who are actually 

952
00:47:23,791 --> 00:47:27,780
talking about this subject that I was 
dealing with is that they are,

953
00:47:28,040 --> 00:47:28,873
they're purely people are purely 
disingenuous on the subject and the day 

954
00:47:34,020 --> 00:47:34,853
and actually it's kind of interesting.
I think that they want to create 

955
00:47:37,961 --> 00:47:38,794
something,
what I was telling you about Bashar Al 

956
00:47:40,120 --> 00:47:40,953
Assad,
which is to destroy all the nuanced 

957
00:47:44,560 --> 00:47:45,393
approach of the liberal critics of Islam
and try to create the battle between 

958
00:47:49,630 --> 00:47:50,463
them and people like Pamela Geller and 
Robert Spencer and all of the far right 

959
00:47:55,540 --> 00:47:56,750
morons.
Yeah.

960
00:47:56,860 --> 00:48:00,730
And so that way they will give people a 
binary system and which they tell.

961
00:48:01,060 --> 00:48:04,390
You know what?
So there was a war between far right,

962
00:48:04,391 --> 00:48:07,860
fascist and Muslim medicine people.
So which side you can achieve.

963
00:48:07,990 --> 00:48:10,070
I love that.
I love that framing because I,

964
00:48:10,270 --> 00:48:11,103
I mean I'm getting email literally from 
all over the world every day at this 

965
00:48:14,441 --> 00:48:16,930
point.
People talking about this middle ground.

966
00:48:17,140 --> 00:48:17,973
Yes.
That's why I wanted to connect with you 

967
00:48:18,851 --> 00:48:19,684
and that's why I've been talking about 
this stuff on the show because I don't 

968
00:48:21,221 --> 00:48:25,300
think most people are one side or the 
far left or the far right.

969
00:48:25,480 --> 00:48:26,740
Most people are right here.

970
00:48:26,910 --> 00:48:28,030
Yeah.
I mean for the.

971
00:48:28,080 --> 00:48:31,380
I mean sometimes I'm in on college 
campuses.

972
00:48:31,740 --> 00:48:36,240
It seems to me that the debate is also 
like it's very polarized.

973
00:48:36,270 --> 00:48:39,360
Like I and I was speaking at UC Berkeley
and Palo Alto and I,

974
00:48:39,650 --> 00:48:40,483
and I'm speaking in Cornell and I spoken
so many universities before that I can 

975
00:48:43,351 --> 00:48:44,184
see that encompasses the debate seems to
be much more polarized and it's on the 

976
00:48:49,891 --> 00:48:51,490
media and the

977
00:48:52,060 --> 00:48:53,360
and,
and I'm guessing it's a lot.

978
00:48:53,400 --> 00:48:56,010
It's a lot of white liberals on the 
left.

979
00:48:56,230 --> 00:48:57,610
Yes.
It is upset with you.

980
00:48:57,670 --> 00:48:58,301
Yes.
It,

981
00:48:58,301 --> 00:48:59,134
which is which is extremely,
so they always want to turn it up by 

982
00:49:00,970 --> 00:49:01,900
them.
I was like,

983
00:49:01,950 --> 00:49:05,260
I,
I kept talking about like issues like to

984
00:49:05,261 --> 00:49:07,660
honor killing in Iraq and things of that
sort.

985
00:49:08,050 --> 00:49:11,260
And then a guy jumps up.
There has to be like a white liberal.

986
00:49:11,261 --> 00:49:12,094
They are,
so there has to be this guy that was 

987
00:49:12,941 --> 00:49:15,100
gonna be.
This dude shows up at my venue,

988
00:49:15,390 --> 00:49:17,230
uh,
whatever I go around this state.

989
00:49:17,231 --> 00:49:20,010
So say no.
It's nothing to do with the culture.

990
00:49:20,011 --> 00:49:22,270
It's nothing to do with the legendary.
It's all about us.

991
00:49:22,780 --> 00:49:23,613
Don't you know about that?
Have you have to give me like the 

992
00:49:24,881 --> 00:49:27,250
lecture about the military industrial 
complex.

993
00:49:27,251 --> 00:49:29,290
Don't you know about Wall Street?
Don't pay taxes.

994
00:49:29,510 --> 00:49:31,570
The so,
so none of the stuff.

995
00:49:31,750 --> 00:49:33,540
You're not defending any of it.
Exactly.

996
00:49:33,840 --> 00:49:34,780
There is no correlation.

997
00:49:34,780 --> 00:49:35,270
I mean,
I,

998
00:49:35,270 --> 00:49:36,103
like I,
I always mentioned this example is that 

999
00:49:37,360 --> 00:49:39,280
for example,
if somebody,

1000
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:41,890
let's say a radical Muslim,
he walks in,

1001
00:49:42,070 --> 00:49:46,900
let's say a small town in Arkansas or 
Mississippi and some redneck goes in and

1002
00:49:46,901 --> 00:49:48,840
calls them like a San Diego and like,
oh,

1003
00:49:48,860 --> 00:49:51,580
he faced any racism there.
And then this person,

1004
00:49:51,581 --> 00:49:55,570
the same person goes back to his house 
and kills his daughter because she added

1005
00:49:55,571 --> 00:49:56,404
the guy on facebook.
These two actions are not related to 

1006
00:49:58,230 --> 00:49:59,063
with each other.
Is that what some people think is that 

1007
00:50:01,660 --> 00:50:04,480
this guy,
because he's facing oppression or racism

1008
00:50:04,481 --> 00:50:07,900
and some sort does lead,
let him to kill his daughter,

1009
00:50:07,901 --> 00:50:08,734
which something that he believed in 
probably before he came to the United 

1010
00:50:12,070 --> 00:50:13,990
States.
And so yeah,

1011
00:50:13,991 --> 00:50:18,220
and they think that everything is really
centered about oppression dynamics and,

1012
00:50:18,350 --> 00:50:19,183
and what's happening is that now you can
not even talk about the subject without 

1013
00:50:22,060 --> 00:50:24,900
claiming to be a victim and it claiming 
to be oppressed now.

1014
00:50:24,910 --> 00:50:25,743
Like the whole competition is that who's
the most victim and that's like I don't 

1015
00:50:29,241 --> 00:50:32,570
really want to go to the identity 
politics myself because it's like a very

1016
00:50:32,780 --> 00:50:33,613
crazy world is like all that.
Like now I look at websites like tumblr 

1017
00:50:36,771 --> 00:50:39,990
or things like this and was like,
somebody identification is like,

1018
00:50:40,190 --> 00:50:42,820
it's not like,
oh I'm from there and I studied there or

1019
00:50:42,821 --> 00:50:44,030
whatever.
It's like I,

1020
00:50:44,040 --> 00:50:46,760
I'm transgender,
gender fluid,

1021
00:50:46,850 --> 00:50:49,190
a asexual,
this,

1022
00:50:49,191 --> 00:50:49,851
this,
this,

1023
00:50:49,851 --> 00:50:50,684
this is all about like his oppression,
like how much is oppressed and that is 

1024
00:50:54,890 --> 00:50:58,280
what is now concerned the biography like
in some places.

1025
00:50:58,330 --> 00:50:59,030
So

1026
00:50:59,030 --> 00:50:59,863
at some level,
if you could lighten your skin and to 

1027
00:51:01,770 --> 00:51:02,603
change your biography away from Iraq,
they'd like you a little bit more in a 

1028
00:51:05,121 --> 00:51:08,690
weird way because they would think that 
you're helping the oppressed.

1029
00:51:09,180 --> 00:51:10,013
Yeah.
Of somehow being from the place that 

1030
00:51:11,901 --> 00:51:14,180
you're now betraying.
Like it's so warped.

1031
00:51:14,210 --> 00:51:14,790
Yeah,

1032
00:51:14,790 --> 00:51:15,770
it's very.
Yeah,

1033
00:51:16,220 --> 00:51:18,380
it's very.
I mean that as I said,

1034
00:51:18,381 --> 00:51:19,910
like they,
they look at the wall,

1035
00:51:19,940 --> 00:51:20,773
the wall is pretty much like as a 
pyramid and that's what like if you a 

1036
00:51:24,410 --> 00:51:25,243
view blood like the critical race theory
and gender theory and it's pretty much 

1037
00:51:29,151 --> 00:51:29,984
all about class,
gender and race and there's hardly any 

1038
00:51:32,481 --> 00:51:36,440
mention of ideology and they.
So that's the way they see the world.

1039
00:51:36,441 --> 00:51:37,274
So is there anything that a brown person
is doing even though that his culture 

1040
00:51:43,161 --> 00:51:45,950
that existed before the United States or
even Israel,

1041
00:51:47,500 --> 00:51:48,333
they say,
well this is as it as well of he's an 

1042
00:51:50,271 --> 00:51:52,970
oppressed by the somebody else on the 
upper class.

1043
00:51:53,120 --> 00:51:54,770
But there is a,
there are signs of hope.

1044
00:51:54,771 --> 00:51:55,604
I mean,
for example,

1045
00:51:55,780 --> 00:51:57,860
give me some hope.
We've got about eight minutes left.

1046
00:51:57,861 --> 00:52:00,530
Let's.
There are signs of hope strongly is that

1047
00:52:01,230 --> 00:52:04,910
people go to movements at Oregon,
they see like the continuous help,

1048
00:52:04,911 --> 00:52:05,744
like many of these activists are doing,
they're trying to achieve things in 

1049
00:52:07,761 --> 00:52:08,594
their own countries because like when I 
started becoming an and when I started 

1050
00:52:10,701 --> 00:52:11,534
like being active as myself and,
and there were only very few people I 

1051
00:52:14,151 --> 00:52:16,010
see on the Internet who are sacred are 
free thinkers.

1052
00:52:16,070 --> 00:52:20,660
Now I look at facebook and social media 
and I see tons of thousands from Iraq,

1053
00:52:20,661 --> 00:52:22,910
from Syria,
from Lebanon,

1054
00:52:22,940 --> 00:52:23,773
from all over the Arab world.
Countries like Malaysia has voted for a 

1055
00:52:26,691 --> 00:52:31,250
secular country despite of all the 
status quo of the region.

1056
00:52:31,251 --> 00:52:32,084
Is that,
is that many people think that the 

1057
00:52:34,370 --> 00:52:35,203
Middle East is like one country.
If it's like things out of bad 

1058
00:52:36,681 --> 00:52:38,090
somewhere,
it's bad everywhere else.

1059
00:52:38,860 --> 00:52:41,660
I mean places like northern Iraq,
which is a Kurdish region,

1060
00:52:41,960 --> 00:52:45,170
they seem to be much more developed in 
terms of human rights,

1061
00:52:45,450 --> 00:52:46,283
uh,
than they have women on the ground 

1062
00:52:47,691 --> 00:52:48,970
fighting Isis.
Yeah.

1063
00:52:49,080 --> 00:52:50,610
Then Turkeys bombing them.
That's a whole lot.

1064
00:52:50,880 --> 00:52:53,080
That's the.
I mean I've,

1065
00:52:53,600 --> 00:52:54,433
as I said,
there are signs of pessimism because 

1066
00:52:56,001 --> 00:52:56,834
Turkey has a long secular history and it
is going backward with the but at the 

1067
00:53:01,911 --> 00:53:02,744
same time there is a,
I mean I would say a very strong 

1068
00:53:04,640 --> 00:53:08,780
position for the Argon in Turkey that 
needs to be supported and that's,

1069
00:53:09,180 --> 00:53:10,013
and that's I think like if there's any 
message I would give to the liberals is 

1070
00:53:12,300 --> 00:53:13,700
like just don't betray us here.

1071
00:53:13,940 --> 00:53:14,773
Like the liberals in the way should 
stand with their fellow liberals on the 

1072
00:53:17,571 --> 00:53:18,404
east and,
and just start to apply standards and 

1073
00:53:21,230 --> 00:53:23,240
should not stand with our enemies.
That's,

1074
00:53:23,360 --> 00:53:25,620
that's if there's a message I can say 
just stand.

1075
00:53:25,830 --> 00:53:27,070
If you don't want to help,
just done,

1076
00:53:27,110 --> 00:53:30,180
don't stand with our lab.
Just make it easier.

1077
00:53:30,630 --> 00:53:31,463
Well I love that message and I love the 
fact that you brought it also back to 

1078
00:53:33,871 --> 00:53:34,704
colleges because that's where I started 
the show today because we know we have 

1079
00:53:37,051 --> 00:53:37,884
all this stuff with what's going on on 
our yard to Missouri and yelled the 

1080
00:53:40,920 --> 00:53:42,150
recent cases.
Exactly.

1081
00:53:42,151 --> 00:53:45,400
So that's what we were talking about 
earlier and to me it's,

1082
00:53:45,430 --> 00:53:49,170
it's a direct extension of what these 
guys on the left have done.

1083
00:53:49,500 --> 00:53:52,030
They've made everyone so intolerant.
Yes.

1084
00:53:52,050 --> 00:53:52,883
As you're saying that now it's sort of 
like they are now reaping what they 

1085
00:53:55,920 --> 00:53:57,070
sowed,
Yada.

1086
00:53:57,070 --> 00:54:00,800
It's kind of very interesting.
It's like it's a slippery slope.

1087
00:54:00,801 --> 00:54:01,634
They're like,
you're going to see over the moment of 

1088
00:54:02,871 --> 00:54:04,440
time they're going to start at talking 
to each other.

1089
00:54:04,441 --> 00:54:06,690
So it was,
it was a female,

1090
00:54:06,691 --> 00:54:07,524
the female white feminist or criticizing
male white feminists as being male 

1091
00:54:10,771 --> 00:54:11,604
privilege.
Now the female is going to get attacked 

1092
00:54:14,011 --> 00:54:16,440
by a transgender disabled person of 
color.

1093
00:54:16,600 --> 00:54:19,260
You're the white tiles,
tiles,

1094
00:54:19,350 --> 00:54:21,270
gender nondisabled.
Uh,

1095
00:54:21,590 --> 00:54:25,740
so they're going to start talking to 
each other and eventually nobody's going

1096
00:54:25,741 --> 00:54:28,860
to be allowed to speak because anybody's
going to claim our fence.

1097
00:54:29,220 --> 00:54:30,053
And um,
that all the trivializing their 

1098
00:54:32,191 --> 00:54:35,490
experience of,
of just ended with a funny story.

1099
00:54:35,500 --> 00:54:36,333
I mean,
with people like this is somebody 

1100
00:54:38,370 --> 00:54:40,320
messaged me and he said,
she said,

1101
00:54:41,100 --> 00:54:43,830
you should stopped posting pictures of 
you smiling on facebook.

1102
00:54:43,980 --> 00:54:44,970
And I said like,
yeah,

1103
00:54:44,971 --> 00:54:45,840
what's going on over here?

1104
00:54:46,200 --> 00:54:47,860
And then she said,
uh,

1105
00:54:47,940 --> 00:54:48,773
when you post pictures of you smiling,
you are intentionally trying to 

1106
00:54:52,171 --> 00:54:54,630
trivialize the experience of depressed 
people.

1107
00:54:55,500 --> 00:54:56,730
I was like,
lol,

1108
00:54:56,820 --> 00:54:57,653
are you kidding me?
And then she like blocked me 

1109
00:54:58,891 --> 00:55:01,920
immediately.
So,

1110
00:55:01,950 --> 00:55:02,783
so,
and eventually the 44 does this person 

1111
00:55:04,291 --> 00:55:05,124
get attacked.
But other people who may also consider 

1112
00:55:07,561 --> 00:55:08,394
her trivializing their experience by 
like eating food without hand because 

1113
00:55:12,301 --> 00:55:13,190
they're disabled.
So,

1114
00:55:13,340 --> 00:55:15,240
so,
so it just never ends,

1115
00:55:15,960 --> 00:55:16,980
never ends.
And I think,

1116
00:55:17,160 --> 00:55:17,993
but I'm very glad that there's now a 
counter movement to who are the real 

1117
00:55:21,361 --> 00:55:24,990
liberals standing against the 
progressives.

1118
00:55:25,050 --> 00:55:25,883
And um,
because the thing is I want everyone to 

1119
00:55:27,631 --> 00:55:28,464
be treated equally equally as shitty.
You don't have to treat everyone as 

1120
00:55:31,081 --> 00:55:32,700
equally great.
Treat everyone equally as shitty.

1121
00:55:32,701 --> 00:55:33,534
That would be fine with me.
I want women wherever they are to be 

1122
00:55:35,881 --> 00:55:36,714
treated equal,
whether the United States or whether 

1123
00:55:38,461 --> 00:55:39,294
they're in Saudi Arabia,
I want gay people to be treated equally 

1124
00:55:40,711 --> 00:55:44,580
where I want the white,
CIS male to be treated shitty.

1125
00:55:44,580 --> 00:55:47,840
That guy can be treated well,
let's hope not.

1126
00:55:47,850 --> 00:55:49,110
But uh,
yeah,

1127
00:55:49,111 --> 00:55:50,090
I mean that is,
that is,

1128
00:55:50,340 --> 00:55:51,173
I mean,
that's what really motivated me when I 

1129
00:55:52,411 --> 00:55:54,360
started my activism is,
is literally,

1130
00:55:54,540 --> 00:55:55,373
I mean,
the movement that I started is called 

1131
00:55:56,461 --> 00:55:57,294
the global secular humanist movement in 
which after seeing so many conflicts 

1132
00:56:00,571 --> 00:56:03,390
about sectarianism and religious 
extremism rising up,

1133
00:56:03,750 --> 00:56:07,320
is that the best way is to create a 
sector of society,

1134
00:56:07,590 --> 00:56:09,720
secular,
liberal society in which all people,

1135
00:56:09,960 --> 00:56:10,793
regardless of race or gender or sexual 
orientation would live equally without 

1136
00:56:15,840 --> 00:56:17,040
saying that,
oh,

1137
00:56:17,170 --> 00:56:19,890
because it's their culture and things of
that sort.

1138
00:56:19,891 --> 00:56:20,730
Because,
I mean,

1139
00:56:20,731 --> 00:56:21,420
my,
my,

1140
00:56:21,420 --> 00:56:23,860
uh,
motto as humans have rights,

1141
00:56:24,090 --> 00:56:27,120
cultures and beliefs,
don't todd rice and yeah,

1142
00:56:27,420 --> 00:56:28,253
ideas that should be up to criticism and
debates and human eyes have to be 

1143
00:56:31,241 --> 00:56:32,910
sustained all across the board.
Well,

1144
00:56:32,960 --> 00:56:34,660
all right,
well that's a beautiful ending.

1145
00:56:34,660 --> 00:56:36,520
You will always have my support.
Well,

1146
00:56:36,521 --> 00:56:37,660
thank you.
And I think,

1147
00:56:37,661 --> 00:56:38,494
uh,
I think we're onto something because 

1148
00:56:39,521 --> 00:56:40,354
when,
even when I was tweeting that you were 

1149
00:56:40,901 --> 00:56:41,734
coming on,
people wanted to hear this and I think 

1150
00:56:43,181 --> 00:56:44,014
you're right.
Even though there's a lot of bad stuff 

1151
00:56:45,191 --> 00:56:46,024
going on,
there is some hope there and that there 

1152
00:56:46,711 --> 00:56:49,600
was a lot of signs of hope and and I 
think your show is one of them.

1153
00:56:49,780 --> 00:56:50,613
Alright,
well I appreciate that you guys can 

1154
00:56:52,060 --> 00:56:54,890
follow Fi's with Feisal Alma Matar on 
the twitter.

1155
00:56:54,891 --> 00:56:55,481
Hi.
Thanks for watching.

1156
00:56:55,481 --> 00:56:56,560
Everybody will do it again next week.
