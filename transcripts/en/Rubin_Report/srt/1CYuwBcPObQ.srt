1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:00,893
Yeah,

2
00:00:02,650 --> 00:00:03,483
hey everyone,
we're going to be doing something a 

3
00:00:03,791 --> 00:00:04,624
little different this week.
I've got my new eyes jumping on a skype 

4
00:00:06,821 --> 00:00:09,080
call shortly.
He and Sam Harris or cough.

5
00:00:09,081 --> 00:00:09,914
There is a new book about Islam and 
Maajid is a former Islamic extremist 

6
00:00:13,331 --> 00:00:15,580
himself.
A ton of you guys have been asking us to

7
00:00:15,581 --> 00:00:16,840
sit down,
but he lives in London,

8
00:00:16,841 --> 00:00:19,060
so we thought we'd give the skype thing 
a shot.

9
00:00:19,061 --> 00:00:20,440
Actually,
he's in New York at the moment.

10
00:00:20,441 --> 00:00:23,500
I saw a picture of him and Morgan 
Freeman in a mosque yesterday,

11
00:00:23,501 --> 00:00:26,260
so I'm going to ask him about that and 
much more in a little bit,

12
00:00:26,590 --> 00:00:27,940
but first let's do a little 
housekeeping.

13
00:00:28,150 --> 00:00:28,983
I want to talk about some of the 
principles we laid out in the first 

14
00:00:30,491 --> 00:00:32,860
episode and some of the reaction to last
week show.

15
00:00:33,100 --> 00:00:35,380
It seems that a bunch of you weren't 
thrilled with my guest.

16
00:00:35,381 --> 00:00:36,214
Jimmy.
Jimmy is a hardcore lefty progressive 

17
00:00:37,961 --> 00:00:42,100
and uses some of the tactics I mentioned
that I wouldn't be using on the show.

18
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:43,113
First,
let me just say that I can only hold 

19
00:00:43,991 --> 00:00:44,824
myself to the rules that I laid out if I
stopped and mentioned saying every time 

20
00:00:48,251 --> 00:00:49,084
a guest said,
saying that goes against my personal 

21
00:00:50,531 --> 00:00:51,364
rules,
the show would be incredibly slow and 

22
00:00:53,620 --> 00:00:55,450
horrifically painful.
More importantly,

23
00:00:55,451 --> 00:00:58,420
as we build a community based on 
tolerance and other ideas,

24
00:00:58,421 --> 00:01:02,050
it's important that we remain tolerant 
of ideas we don't like.

25
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:05,350
Jimmy is a great friend of mine.
We've worked together on air for years.

26
00:01:05,351 --> 00:01:06,184
We've done standup gigs together and 
I've had him and his wife over for 

27
00:01:08,171 --> 00:01:09,830
dinner numerous times.
Yeah,

28
00:01:09,850 --> 00:01:13,030
we don't agree on everything,
including some pretty big issues,

29
00:01:13,330 --> 00:01:14,163
but I think life is about more than just
scoring who is right on everything all 

30
00:01:16,961 --> 00:01:18,900
the time.
The most interesting part of last week's

31
00:01:18,910 --> 00:01:22,660
response was that some people said the 
episode was an echo chamber and I didn't

32
00:01:22,661 --> 00:01:23,680
push back enough.

33
00:01:23,890 --> 00:01:27,550
Other people question why I even had 
people I disagree with on at all,

34
00:01:27,790 --> 00:01:29,380
and that's the beauty of the Internet,
right?

35
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:30,273
We can all be part of the same exact 
conversation and still see it through 

36
00:01:33,191 --> 00:01:36,820
our individual prisons.
Good journalism is the search for truth.

37
00:01:36,850 --> 00:01:37,683
This show will be a battle of ideas,
not just having our own ideas 

38
00:01:40,631 --> 00:01:41,530
reinforced,
you know,

39
00:01:41,531 --> 00:01:42,364
there's so much intolerance of the other
on both sides and I think we can create 

40
00:01:45,401 --> 00:01:46,960
something that's so much better than 
that.

41
00:01:47,020 --> 00:01:48,250
Actually,
I don't just think it.

42
00:01:48,251 --> 00:01:50,710
I know it because I see it already 
happening.

43
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:53,470
Last week I had a hardcore progressive 
lefty.

44
00:01:53,710 --> 00:01:57,190
This week I have a former Islamic 
extremists turned moderate,

45
00:01:57,191 --> 00:02:00,670
trying to reform his religion.
Next week I have a gay conservative from

46
00:02:00,730 --> 00:02:02,380
Breitbart,
Milo Yiannopoulos.

47
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:04,300
I won't agree with all of them all the 
time,

48
00:02:04,301 --> 00:02:06,550
but I most likely won't shout them down 
either.

49
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:10,060
I have enough faith in you guys that if 
we have an honest conversation here,

50
00:02:10,061 --> 00:02:11,920
the truth will present itself.
This of course,

51
00:02:11,921 --> 00:02:15,130
reminds me of the Galactic Republic.
In the early days of the death star,

52
00:02:15,131 --> 00:02:18,820
grandma tarkin wanted to stifle debate 
because they had the most powerful super

53
00:02:18,821 --> 00:02:20,590
laser in the universe.
Of course,

54
00:02:20,591 --> 00:02:24,550
let's not forget that darth vader said 
that the death star was nothing compared

55
00:02:24,551 --> 00:02:28,000
to the power of the force.
The force is on our side.

56
00:02:28,390 --> 00:02:29,350
Let's use it wisely.

57
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:32,310
Alright.

58
00:02:32,310 --> 00:02:35,210
So much and thanks for doing this.
We've been going back and forth for,

59
00:02:35,230 --> 00:02:37,080
for months now.
I've only had to show up for,

60
00:02:37,081 --> 00:02:37,914
for three weeks,
but we've been going back and forth for 

61
00:02:38,991 --> 00:02:40,150
awhile.
And uh,

62
00:02:40,230 --> 00:02:42,210
you're in New York right now?
Uh,

63
00:02:42,230 --> 00:02:43,700
you live,
you live in London,

64
00:02:43,701 --> 00:02:45,050
correct?
That's right.

65
00:02:45,051 --> 00:02:45,830
Yeah.
Yeah.

66
00:02:45,830 --> 00:02:46,663
So you live in London,
so you're halfway between a Los Angeles 

67
00:02:49,551 --> 00:02:52,520
and London.
So I figured we'd do the skype because I

68
00:02:52,521 --> 00:02:53,450
don't know when you're gonna be out 
here.

69
00:02:53,451 --> 00:02:54,680
Any,
any La plans coming?

70
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:56,393
I don't know.
I'd love to come to La and I was good 

71
00:02:59,291 --> 00:03:00,020
friends in,
uh,

72
00:03:00,020 --> 00:03:02,110
on the west coast,
but nothing fixed yet.

73
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:04,120
So it's good to have this opportunity.

74
00:03:04,210 --> 00:03:04,751
Yeah.
All right,

75
00:03:04,751 --> 00:03:07,330
so we'll do the skype thing with you in 
New York and La.

76
00:03:07,331 --> 00:03:08,164
So first off I saw a picture of you that
you tweeted yesterday you were hanging 

77
00:03:12,191 --> 00:03:14,930
out with Morgan Freeman in a mosque.
So what,

78
00:03:14,931 --> 00:03:15,790
what was that about?

79
00:03:16,590 --> 00:03:17,423
Yes.
This is what's brought me here to a New 

80
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:22,260
York icon.
Explain too much of it at the moment.

81
00:03:22,261 --> 00:03:25,680
All I can say is that I had a great 
conversation with him in the,

82
00:03:25,730 --> 00:03:27,150
uh,
in the Islamic center of,

83
00:03:27,170 --> 00:03:28,050
uh,
of New York.

84
00:03:28,450 --> 00:03:31,620
Uh,
we spent a good hour or so having a chat

85
00:03:32,010 --> 00:03:36,580
about the distinctions between Islam and
Islamism and,

86
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:38,940
uh,
about my story and the work I do.

87
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:41,010
Um,
but beyond that we're just going to have

88
00:03:41,011 --> 00:03:42,810
to wait and see what else I'm to.

89
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:44,730
All right,
well now he's played God.

90
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:47,340
So I guess he's the right guy to talk to
on that

91
00:03:47,940 --> 00:03:49,410
in,
in the house of God.

92
00:03:49,411 --> 00:03:52,050
I was speaking to a man that played God 
about God.

93
00:03:52,300 --> 00:03:53,170
Alright,
there you go.

94
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:54,011
Okay.
So,

95
00:03:54,011 --> 00:03:54,844
uh,
I want to talk to you about some of the 

96
00:03:55,661 --> 00:03:57,400
things that you probably did speak with 
him that.

97
00:03:57,550 --> 00:04:00,190
So first,
let's just start with your story because

98
00:04:00,210 --> 00:04:01,810
your,
your biography,

99
00:04:01,811 --> 00:04:04,570
what you've lived through to get to here
is really,

100
00:04:04,571 --> 00:04:08,010
really incredible.
So can you just sort of sum that up in a

101
00:04:08,010 --> 00:04:08,470
couple minutes,

102
00:04:08,470 --> 00:04:09,890
those who want the,
as you know,

103
00:04:09,891 --> 00:04:12,680
the full story.
It's in my memoir called radical.

104
00:04:12,860 --> 00:04:13,460
Um,
but,

105
00:04:13,460 --> 00:04:15,140
but in a,
in a summarized form,

106
00:04:15,770 --> 00:04:20,480
basically I joined a revolutionary Islam
is group at the age of 16 years old.

107
00:04:21,050 --> 00:04:21,883
Uh,
I ended up on the leadership of this 

108
00:04:22,911 --> 00:04:23,744
organization and spent 13 years with 
them and I played my role in exporting 

109
00:04:27,171 --> 00:04:28,004
this organization from Britain to 
Pakistan and then to Denmark and 

110
00:04:31,431 --> 00:04:34,420
eventually to Egypt.
The group's name was his,

111
00:04:34,730 --> 00:04:35,563
had.
It was the first among these limits 

112
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:42,560
groups to popular reaction of 
resurrecting a caliphate that would seek

113
00:04:43,071 --> 00:04:47,150
to conquer other countries and enforce 
their version of Islam as low.

114
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:48,440
And,
uh,

115
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:52,580
the method by which they aimed to come 
to power was by a military coups.

116
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:53,473
So we are very much focused in 
recruiting army officers to join our 

117
00:04:56,271 --> 00:04:58,770
organization and then inciting them 
towards military coups.

118
00:04:59,210 --> 00:05:03,350
And that's what took me to Pakistan is 
what eventually took me to Egypt.

119
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:05,870
I arrived one day before the nine slash 
11 attacks.

120
00:05:05,871 --> 00:05:06,704
And then 10 months later I found myself 
arrested and detained and taken to the 

121
00:05:11,001 --> 00:05:11,834
torture dungeons of Egypt,
stir state security headquarters in 

122
00:05:14,421 --> 00:05:15,254
Cairo.
And then sentenced after four months in 

123
00:05:17,270 --> 00:05:20,030
solitary confinement.
Sentenced to five years in prison.

124
00:05:20,630 --> 00:05:21,463
As a political prisoner,
that's at that point is when Amnesty 

125
00:05:25,610 --> 00:05:27,680
International adopted me as a prisoner 
of conscience,

126
00:05:27,990 --> 00:05:30,020
uh,
began campaigning for my release because

127
00:05:30,021 --> 00:05:30,770
of course,
no,

128
00:05:30,770 --> 00:05:35,770
we had views that I now find repugnant 
and what described as extreme,

129
00:05:36,230 --> 00:05:37,063
uh,
we were and we had a group still is non 

130
00:05:39,140 --> 00:05:39,973
non terrorist,
which is why it's still illegal in 

131
00:05:41,361 --> 00:05:44,150
America and across across Europe.
So it's,

132
00:05:44,151 --> 00:05:44,984
it's the distinction I draw between an 
Islamist group and a jihadist group is 

133
00:05:47,991 --> 00:05:48,824
that if Islam,
Islam is the desire to impose any 

134
00:05:50,091 --> 00:05:54,890
interpretation of Islam over society,
a jihadism is the use of force to spread

135
00:05:54,891 --> 00:05:56,620
Islam,
Islam and uh,

136
00:05:56,640 --> 00:05:57,473
and,
and jihadist terrorism is the use of 

137
00:05:59,230 --> 00:06:01,700
force to spread Islam Islam by targeting
civilians.

138
00:06:02,260 --> 00:06:04,010
Um,
the group that I joined wasn't.

139
00:06:04,030 --> 00:06:05,750
Islam is group.
It wasn't a jihadist group.

140
00:06:05,830 --> 00:06:06,663
Right.
So I'm glad you made that distinction 

141
00:06:07,781 --> 00:06:08,614
because I do find that when we're having
this conversation and it's being had by 

142
00:06:12,251 --> 00:06:13,084
so many different people in so many 
different forms that just the 

143
00:06:14,561 --> 00:06:15,394
definitions alone are lost.
And I know you've done a lot of work 

144
00:06:17,891 --> 00:06:18,724
trying to just explain that kind of 
stuff to people so they're able to 

145
00:06:21,220 --> 00:06:22,480
understand what we're talking about 
here.

146
00:06:22,790 --> 00:06:23,400
Yeah,
positive.

147
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:25,860
The problem is because this is a 
phenomenon that we've never really dealt

148
00:06:25,861 --> 00:06:26,694
with before in terms of human beings 
have never really dealt with this 

149
00:06:29,101 --> 00:06:34,101
phenomenon of a,
of ideological Islam seeking a,

150
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:36,780
uh,
a very bolshevik form of control,

151
00:06:36,870 --> 00:06:40,080
totalitarian control over society.
We simply as,

152
00:06:40,140 --> 00:06:40,973
as,
as people didn't have the lexicon to 

153
00:06:42,091 --> 00:06:44,880
have these conversations.
So though I use the definitions,

154
00:06:44,881 --> 00:06:49,560
you won't find these definitions,
tolton universities or in academic tomes

155
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:52,680
because people will dealt with the 
problem before.

156
00:06:52,681 --> 00:06:56,910
So part of the challenge that we faced 
was in coming up with very crystal clear

157
00:06:57,660 --> 00:07:00,630
logical definitions and then 
popularizing them.

158
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:02,250
Uh,
and so you often,

159
00:07:02,251 --> 00:07:03,084
you'll find that I repeat myself a lot 
and the reason I repeat myself is 

160
00:07:05,671 --> 00:07:06,750
because,
you know,

161
00:07:07,010 --> 00:07:07,843
uh,
we have to popularize these terms into 

162
00:07:10,050 --> 00:07:10,883
popularize.
These concepts can only come through 

163
00:07:12,391 --> 00:07:14,940
repetition until everyone finally begins
to understand.

164
00:07:14,941 --> 00:07:17,430
And it got to a point where the prime 
minister of the UK understood.

165
00:07:17,730 --> 00:07:18,990
So we got somewhere.

166
00:07:19,100 --> 00:07:19,933
Okay,
so you spent about five years in an 

167
00:07:21,411 --> 00:07:24,320
Egyptian prison now that was under 
Mubarak at the time,

168
00:07:24,350 --> 00:07:27,650
who technically,
I suppose he was known as the president,

169
00:07:27,651 --> 00:07:31,160
but he basically was a dictator that was
backed by the US for about 30 years.

170
00:07:31,350 --> 00:07:32,183
What?
What was that like being in an Egyptian 

171
00:07:33,501 --> 00:07:34,580
prison?
I can't imagine.

172
00:07:35,950 --> 00:07:36,783
Well,
it wasn't a pleasant experience at all 

173
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:41,710
to the torture.
First of all,

174
00:07:41,711 --> 00:07:42,544
for the first four days and then we will
put into solitary confinement for four 

175
00:07:44,741 --> 00:07:49,630
months and I was held in a cell as well.
All of us are in that period of solitary

176
00:07:49,631 --> 00:07:52,420
confinement cells where in which we had 
no sanitation,

177
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:53,590
no lights,
no,

178
00:07:53,740 --> 00:07:54,573
no beds.
We had nothing but a bad concrete cell 

179
00:07:57,050 --> 00:08:00,490
in which to a English to try and get 
through without,

180
00:08:00,580 --> 00:08:01,413
without going insane.
And so I have with me actually I wanted 

181
00:08:03,791 --> 00:08:08,791
to show you this because I had a.
When I was arrested I had a pocket sized

182
00:08:09,221 --> 00:08:12,040
version of the Koran,
which is this in my hand here.

183
00:08:12,470 --> 00:08:13,303
This,
this particular Koran has been with me 

184
00:08:16,090 --> 00:08:19,570
from the day of my wrist all the way 
through the torture dungeons through the

185
00:08:19,571 --> 00:08:20,890
solitary confinement.
Wow.

186
00:08:21,030 --> 00:08:21,863
Um,
and then through through the four years 

187
00:08:22,871 --> 00:08:23,704
in prison and,
and one of the things I did is in the 

188
00:08:25,601 --> 00:08:27,160
solitary confinement,
we didn't have any.

189
00:08:27,660 --> 00:08:28,493
I need light to read a or anything so 
and obviously the mind can wander in 

190
00:08:32,621 --> 00:08:35,470
that sort of situation and you fear for 
your own sanity.

191
00:08:35,471 --> 00:08:38,650
So one of the things I would do is stand
by the,

192
00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:39,680
by the door of the,
uh,

193
00:08:39,690 --> 00:08:40,523
of the jail cell has looked for the wait
for the light to seep in through the 

194
00:08:43,511 --> 00:08:45,610
bars.
And then I would stand there and read,

195
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,850
if you can see is a very small text is 
actually tiny now.

196
00:08:48,851 --> 00:08:49,590
Wow.
You,

197
00:08:49,590 --> 00:08:52,600
I would read that.
I ended up memorizing half of it.

198
00:08:52,670 --> 00:08:55,890
I'm sort of in my jail cell,
but it was,

199
00:08:55,891 --> 00:08:56,724
you know,
it was these sorts of things and it's 

200
00:08:57,811 --> 00:08:58,644
why I've kept it seals these sorts of 
things that kept me from going a not 

201
00:09:02,371 --> 00:09:03,204
during the solitary confinement period.
And another thing I want to show you is 

202
00:09:06,180 --> 00:09:06,871
this,
this is,

203
00:09:06,871 --> 00:09:11,020
um,
this is a radio which I had with me is,

204
00:09:11,050 --> 00:09:11,883
is a sort of,
it was given to me by the British 

205
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:17,460
embassy and it was actually on this 
thing that I heard,

206
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:19,470
first time that we'd been charged.

207
00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:24,600
We hadn't been informed officially by 
the BBC World Service.

208
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:28,050
I had reported it.
And so I was listening to it on this and

209
00:09:28,051 --> 00:09:28,884
we found out that we,
in fact we'd been charged and then we 

210
00:09:30,241 --> 00:09:31,740
would go to trial.
Um,

211
00:09:32,050 --> 00:09:33,420
uh,
and finally,

212
00:09:33,421 --> 00:09:34,254
I think this picture is up on the 
Internet when I have the original with 

213
00:09:37,291 --> 00:09:40,320
me and this is something I stole from 
prison.

214
00:09:40,410 --> 00:09:41,243
Um,
and I've kept it with me ever since 

215
00:09:42,670 --> 00:09:43,503
because it meant it means a lot to me.
This is a mug shot that was taken of me 

216
00:09:46,980 --> 00:09:49,230
so that,
that's the day,

217
00:09:49,790 --> 00:09:53,400
that's the very day we would drag from 
the torture dungeon is to be thrown into

218
00:09:53,401 --> 00:09:55,440
solitary.
So that's before I was actually,

219
00:09:55,590 --> 00:09:57,660
before I was actually put into solitary 
confinement.

220
00:09:57,661 --> 00:10:01,380
That's me at 24 years old.
And now you see what you see is my,

221
00:10:01,410 --> 00:10:03,700
uh,
my name in Arabic as you know,

222
00:10:03,790 --> 00:10:06,680
was,
and there is a prison number and uh,

223
00:10:06,750 --> 00:10:07,583
what I've done of course since then is 
I've taken that number which is in 

224
00:10:10,021 --> 00:10:12,670
Arabic a two,
four,

225
00:10:12,930 --> 00:10:13,763
five,
three,

226
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:18,980
and I have tattooed on my back as,
as a reminder for me actually have those

227
00:10:19,111 --> 00:10:22,560
days where I've come from a,
which was your original question and the

228
00:10:22,561 --> 00:10:24,570
journey that I've made to get to where I
am now.

229
00:10:24,750 --> 00:10:26,970
Yeah,
it's such an incredible journey.

230
00:10:27,010 --> 00:10:28,410
Uh,
one other thing on the Gel thing,

231
00:10:28,411 --> 00:10:29,244
I find that fascinating that they let 
you keep a copy of the Qur'an with you 

232
00:10:32,791 --> 00:10:36,990
because wasn't Mubarak basically,
not that he was secular per se,

233
00:10:36,991 --> 00:10:37,771
but they were,
you know,

234
00:10:37,771 --> 00:10:39,990
the Muslim Brotherhood was illegal under
him.

235
00:10:40,170 --> 00:10:43,740
You would think that he would want no 
sign of religion to get the prisoners,

236
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:45,050
uh,
to,

237
00:10:45,180 --> 00:10:48,520
to apprise or something like that.
And yet he let you have it or they will

238
00:10:49,050 --> 00:10:50,310
on the country.
Now,

239
00:10:50,311 --> 00:10:52,030
I'm not gonna,
I'm not about to defend Mubarak.

240
00:10:52,050 --> 00:10:52,883
I cheered when he was overthrown.
It was held in the same cell that he 

241
00:10:55,501 --> 00:10:57,460
held me and afterwards,
so I'm not.

242
00:10:57,461 --> 00:11:00,270
I'm not here in any way to defend Hosni 
Mubarak.

243
00:11:00,271 --> 00:11:04,920
What I would say is that the Egyptian 
dictator and his regime,

244
00:11:05,260 --> 00:11:06,093
I already understood the distinction 
that I now make between Islam and 

245
00:11:09,061 --> 00:11:09,894
Islamism.
Their problem wasn't us holding copies 

246
00:11:11,701 --> 00:11:12,534
of the Koran.
The problem was the interpretation that 

247
00:11:14,461 --> 00:11:15,960
we and,
and,

248
00:11:16,030 --> 00:11:18,560
and the ideology of Islam is that I 
refer to,

249
00:11:19,020 --> 00:11:19,853
in fact,
they would encourage us to study 

250
00:11:22,090 --> 00:11:22,923
traditional medieval Islam because they 
knew that medieval Islam wasn't a Islam 

251
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:28,913
Islam,
and they would encourage us to be 

252
00:11:29,431 --> 00:11:30,264
exposed to theologians from us how 
university we were in prison and that 

253
00:11:34,171 --> 00:11:35,004
books so that we could read about Islam 
from its medieval era and understand it 

254
00:11:38,851 --> 00:11:41,970
wasn't this modern ideological form that
we'd come to adopt.

255
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:46,920
Now I say this and I say it with a 
caveat that of course,

256
00:11:47,010 --> 00:11:47,843
traditional,
ultra conservative medieval Islam also 

257
00:11:49,981 --> 00:11:51,270
needs to be reformed.
You know,

258
00:11:51,430 --> 00:11:52,650
it's,
it's the pinnacle.

259
00:11:52,651 --> 00:11:53,480
It's not that of,
you know,

260
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:54,910
the,
the epitome of,

261
00:11:54,911 --> 00:11:56,380
um,
of civil liberties.

262
00:11:56,650 --> 00:11:57,910
However,
what we,

263
00:11:57,940 --> 00:12:00,670
what we have to accept,
anyone who knows the basic,

264
00:12:00,910 --> 00:12:01,743
the basic thing that most basic thing 
about Islamic history and the 

265
00:12:06,011 --> 00:12:10,300
development on Islamic theology will 
know for all of its faults and there are

266
00:12:10,301 --> 00:12:11,134
plenty of volts by the way.
And fundamentalism largely owes a debt 

267
00:12:14,831 --> 00:12:16,470
to sort of the fact that they,
we,

268
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:17,393
we Muslims generally still revere that 
medieval period of our theology and 

269
00:12:20,921 --> 00:12:21,754
haven't developed it since,
but it's still very different to what 

270
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:28,300
the Islamists project is and a,
and an Egyptian authorities knew that.

271
00:12:28,301 --> 00:12:29,990
So they would encourage us,
you know,

272
00:12:30,010 --> 00:12:35,010
they would rather we were a conservative
religious or fundamentalist Muslims than

273
00:12:35,981 --> 00:12:37,150
members of the Muslim Brotherhood.

274
00:12:37,350 --> 00:12:38,970
Yeah.
That's so fascinating.

275
00:12:38,971 --> 00:12:41,610
And even if you think about what's going
on with Egypt now,

276
00:12:41,611 --> 00:12:42,444
where we sort of have another version of
Mubarak and CC and sort of controlling 

277
00:12:46,651 --> 00:12:47,910
things and yet,
you know,

278
00:12:47,911 --> 00:12:50,460
the Muslim Brotherhood was in charge for
a year and we back them too.

279
00:12:50,461 --> 00:12:50,961
But that,
that,

280
00:12:50,961 --> 00:12:51,794
that's a whole other topic.
So before we move on to some of the 

281
00:12:53,581 --> 00:12:56,490
other stuff,
I saw a clip where you were on real time

282
00:12:56,491 --> 00:12:57,324
with Bill Maher from about a year ago 
and on the overtime segment you 

283
00:12:59,551 --> 00:13:02,970
recounted a story about a bomb maker 
that you met in jail.

284
00:13:03,150 --> 00:13:03,983
And I was hoping you could,
you could just sum that up real quick 

285
00:13:05,341 --> 00:13:07,110
because I thought,
I thought it was fascinating and it goes

286
00:13:07,111 --> 00:13:09,150
to very much what you're talking about 
right now.

287
00:13:09,660 --> 00:13:10,320
Yeah,
sure.

288
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:12,910
Um,
so in prison that was a,

289
00:13:13,250 --> 00:13:14,083
I mean we were imprisoned with the,
who's who of the John Seeing at the 

290
00:13:16,770 --> 00:13:18,780
time.
We had the assassins of.

291
00:13:18,781 --> 00:13:23,781
I'm the oldest of Egypt,
Anwar Sadat who was killed in 1981 group

292
00:13:24,391 --> 00:13:25,580
was known as Tom Freeman,
Jihad.

293
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:28,800
Those who want to execute.
And in that case were with us in prison.

294
00:13:29,220 --> 00:13:30,990
We have a leader of the Muslim 
Brotherhood,

295
00:13:30,991 --> 00:13:34,200
Dr Muhammad and but here has since been 
reincarcerated as you mentioned.

296
00:13:34,650 --> 00:13:35,483
Um,
he wasn't the leader of the Brotherhood 

297
00:13:36,660 --> 00:13:38,670
at the time.
He became the leader of the Brotherhood,

298
00:13:38,671 --> 00:13:41,370
but he and his entire leadership were 
with me in prison.

299
00:13:41,670 --> 00:13:46,200
We have a leadership of his mctivia and 
we also had people that came from abroad

300
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:51,500
and the bomb maker that you refer to a 
particular was from doggystyle next door

301
00:13:51,961 --> 00:13:53,490
to Chechnya.
And uh,

302
00:13:53,491 --> 00:13:54,090
they,
uh,

303
00:13:54,090 --> 00:13:54,923
he came via Afghanistan to Egypt and an 
attempt to cross that off our crossing 

304
00:13:58,201 --> 00:13:59,034
into Gaza to teach us how to make bombs,
but he was caught by the Egyptian 

305
00:14:02,581 --> 00:14:04,440
authorities and they imprison them.

306
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:09,440
They sentenced him to 17 years and I 
became friendly with this band and had a

307
00:14:10,141 --> 00:14:12,390
long conversation with him,
uh,

308
00:14:12,420 --> 00:14:14,480
due to the,
to the London bombings because,

309
00:14:14,481 --> 00:14:16,620
you know,
the invasion of Iraq happened when I was

310
00:14:16,621 --> 00:14:17,454
in prison and the London seven slash 
seven attacks in London bombings and 

311
00:14:21,150 --> 00:14:21,983
sort of the buses and the tubes in 
London also happened when I was in 

312
00:14:23,881 --> 00:14:25,710
prison.
So I locked it.

313
00:14:25,711 --> 00:14:27,930
I kind of got locked into a long 
conversation with this,

314
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:32,070
with this man about the,
in his view then legitimacy of attacking

315
00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:32,933
London.
And I was attempting to convince him 

316
00:14:35,070 --> 00:14:37,140
that it wasn't legitimate.
Now again,

317
00:14:37,141 --> 00:14:40,050
because I used to belong to a non 
terrorist yet revolution,

318
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:41,433
extreme Islamic group.
We didn't believe in jihad isn't input 

319
00:14:44,060 --> 00:14:44,893
to come to power,
so we were arguing with jihadists that 

320
00:14:47,251 --> 00:14:49,400
actually what they should be focusing on
is a minute recoup.

321
00:14:49,410 --> 00:14:52,070
So that's why I was opposing him,
not I hadn't yet left.

322
00:14:52,250 --> 00:14:55,030
I hadn't yet left Islam is,
and it's because my form of Islam,

323
00:14:55,031 --> 00:14:57,270
Islam in its method have,
you know,

324
00:14:57,280 --> 00:15:00,590
it was very different to his and it's 
sort of how it seeks to come to power.

325
00:15:00,660 --> 00:15:02,750
Sure.
But one thing I,

326
00:15:02,751 --> 00:15:05,570
you know,
I'm really proud of is that here's a man

327
00:15:05,571 --> 00:15:08,340
who was trained who was fully capable 
of,

328
00:15:08,370 --> 00:15:11,340
uh,
of making bombs and then causing mayhem,

329
00:15:11,430 --> 00:15:13,910
mayhem and havoc yet,
um,

330
00:15:13,970 --> 00:15:14,803
when I put it to him,
that the justification he uses to say 

331
00:15:18,531 --> 00:15:21,980
that it's legitimate to target,
but just citizens in that they voted for

332
00:15:21,981 --> 00:15:26,160
their government would be the same 
justification one could use for Tux.

333
00:15:26,310 --> 00:15:27,143
So voted for their government in Turkey 
is a member of NATO and NATO as an 

334
00:15:30,201 --> 00:15:33,500
alliance was involved in Afghanistan.
And so,

335
00:15:33,560 --> 00:15:35,720
and so why wouldn't he be bumping 
Turkey?

336
00:15:36,650 --> 00:15:38,550
Um,
and his answer that he,

337
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:40,490
the answer he gave me was a pragmatic 
one.

338
00:15:40,491 --> 00:15:41,324
Not a religious one,
at which point I called him out and I 

339
00:15:43,311 --> 00:15:43,821
said,
you see,

340
00:15:43,821 --> 00:15:44,654
so you know,
what you're doing is you're playing 

341
00:15:45,201 --> 00:15:47,750
politics,
you're giving me a pragmatic answer,

342
00:15:47,751 --> 00:15:49,400
which is the very thing when Bush does 
it,

343
00:15:49,401 --> 00:15:51,770
you criticize Bush for.
Um,

344
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:53,960
the upshot of that conversation was by 
the end of it,

345
00:15:54,410 --> 00:15:55,243
you know,
it took him a couple of days or 

346
00:15:56,001 --> 00:15:56,870
whatever.
He knocked on my,

347
00:15:56,890 --> 00:16:00,260
on my jail cell and he came back looking
really sheepish and he said,

348
00:16:00,261 --> 00:16:01,094
you know,
I've been thinking about what you said 

349
00:16:02,300 --> 00:16:02,751
and,
uh,

350
00:16:02,751 --> 00:16:05,240
I think you're right though.
I just don't think I agree with you.

351
00:16:05,241 --> 00:16:06,074
It's,
it's not justifying to attack a British 

352
00:16:08,070 --> 00:16:08,903
civilians.
And one of the things that really swung 

353
00:16:10,311 --> 00:16:14,420
him was the fact that so many in the UK 
protested against the Iraq war.

354
00:16:14,421 --> 00:16:17,450
So my argument to him was,
how can you be attacking these people?

355
00:16:18,140 --> 00:16:18,891
But I'm happy,
you know,

356
00:16:18,891 --> 00:16:19,724
he changed his mind.
I don't know where he is and what he's 

357
00:16:20,901 --> 00:16:22,220
doing now,
but that's,

358
00:16:22,221 --> 00:16:23,170
you know,
that's a,

359
00:16:23,171 --> 00:16:26,180
it's a small incremental step towards 
peace and reconciliation.

360
00:16:26,181 --> 00:16:30,260
And it was one of the first examples 
that I felt sent me on the path that I'm

361
00:16:30,261 --> 00:16:30,840
now on.

362
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:31,351
Yeah.
And that,

363
00:16:31,351 --> 00:16:33,120
that's why I wanted to ask you about 
that because I,

364
00:16:33,121 --> 00:16:33,954
I love the story.
It's a beautiful story in it and it's 

365
00:16:35,551 --> 00:16:38,490
about what I think your whole life now 
is about,

366
00:16:38,491 --> 00:16:39,324
which is trying to explain all this to 
people and actually get people to 

367
00:16:42,871 --> 00:16:43,704
change.
And I think one of the problems we're 

368
00:16:44,881 --> 00:16:45,714
really having here is that I see both 
sides on this or however many sides do 

369
00:16:49,051 --> 00:16:49,884
you want to say there are.
I see everybody sort of getting 

370
00:16:51,601 --> 00:16:54,810
entrenched and the dialogue sort of 
disappearing.

371
00:16:54,811 --> 00:16:55,644
So I think that's a perfect segue.
You just coauthored a book with Sam 

372
00:16:58,740 --> 00:16:59,573
Harris.
I had Sam on the show a couple of weeks 

373
00:17:00,420 --> 00:17:00,820
ago.
Uh,

374
00:17:00,820 --> 00:17:03,360
it's called Islam and the future of 
tolerance.

375
00:17:03,510 --> 00:17:05,160
Um,
so first off,

376
00:17:05,190 --> 00:17:08,760
I think people would love to know a 
little bit more about the nature of your

377
00:17:08,761 --> 00:17:11,850
relationship with Sam,
how you guys came together.

378
00:17:11,851 --> 00:17:12,571
Sam,
of course,

379
00:17:12,571 --> 00:17:14,610
is a devout atheist.
Uh,

380
00:17:14,611 --> 00:17:15,211
you're,
you're,

381
00:17:15,211 --> 00:17:16,620
you're a practicing Muslim,
correct.

382
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:20,370
I don't call myself religious or devout.
I'm a Muslim,

383
00:17:20,371 --> 00:17:21,204
but I wouldn't want to hold myself up as
any standard for anyone to judge the 

384
00:17:24,301 --> 00:17:25,560
religion by or anything else.

385
00:17:25,770 --> 00:17:26,281
Well,
there you go.

386
00:17:26,281 --> 00:17:27,114
So that said,
tell me a little bit about how you got 

387
00:17:28,981 --> 00:17:29,814
connected with Sam and what sort of 
brought you two together to really go 

388
00:17:33,031 --> 00:17:34,260
ahead and start doing things like this.

389
00:17:35,260 --> 00:17:36,030
So,
uh,

390
00:17:36,030 --> 00:17:36,863
we,
I first met a few years ago when I came 

391
00:17:39,761 --> 00:17:44,080
to New York where I am right now to 
debate a Ayaan Hirsi Ali.

392
00:17:44,710 --> 00:17:48,070
And the motion of the debate was Islam 
is a religion of peace.

393
00:17:48,071 --> 00:17:48,904
And there's something I need to clarify 
with that debate is that I've never 

394
00:17:52,501 --> 00:17:53,334
believed it's saying never sorry.
In my current incarnation off believing 

395
00:17:56,670 --> 00:17:57,630
his,
his area,

396
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:01,320
I've not believed that Islam is a 
religion of war or peace.

397
00:18:01,830 --> 00:18:04,590
And this is something I've been ending 
of my dialogue with Sam.

398
00:18:05,100 --> 00:18:05,933
I chose the side of that motion that 
Islam is a religion of peace because 

399
00:18:08,491 --> 00:18:09,324
there was emotion and I had to choose 
whether it was a religion of war or 

400
00:18:11,821 --> 00:18:12,654
peace and pick a side.
I think the emotion was worded 

401
00:18:14,491 --> 00:18:16,400
incorrectly frankly.
Um,

402
00:18:16,740 --> 00:18:17,570
the,
you know,

403
00:18:17,570 --> 00:18:18,850
I,
I,

404
00:18:18,930 --> 00:18:19,763
there a religion of peace,
it's just a religion and religion's are 

405
00:18:22,201 --> 00:18:23,830
interpreted,
um,

406
00:18:23,940 --> 00:18:24,773
but nevertheless I sat on the side that 
it was a religion of peace because I 

407
00:18:27,181 --> 00:18:28,014
logically reason in my mind that if the 
majority of Muslims today aren't 

408
00:18:30,901 --> 00:18:32,670
jihadist or be at many,
many,

409
00:18:32,671 --> 00:18:33,504
many Muslims are not liberal in the way 
I would like to certainly not jihadist 

410
00:18:37,681 --> 00:18:38,400
terrorists.

411
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:40,140
And so if religion is what people make 
it,

412
00:18:40,190 --> 00:18:43,050
if Islam is what Muslims interpret it to
be,

413
00:18:43,580 --> 00:18:47,220
then by definition it's a religion of 
peace simply because Muslims that are by

414
00:18:47,221 --> 00:18:49,590
the overwhelming majority are not 
terrorists.

415
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:51,790
So I sat on that side of the debate 
night.

416
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:56,800
I debated him afterwards.
We ended up in the dinner afterwards and

417
00:18:57,121 --> 00:18:57,954
uh,
and Sam who happened to be there and I 

418
00:18:59,251 --> 00:19:01,020
hadn't mentioned before and uh,
I,

419
00:19:01,021 --> 00:19:01,854
he was called upon by a ions,
will asked me a question and he asked 

420
00:19:04,561 --> 00:19:05,310
me,
you know,

421
00:19:05,310 --> 00:19:05,760
he said,
look,

422
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:06,593
it's all good and well,
you being out there and needing to 

423
00:19:07,591 --> 00:19:10,470
present this view to the public about 
Islam being this or that.

424
00:19:10,471 --> 00:19:11,304
But,
you know,

425
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:14,430
here between us in the privacy of this,
of this dinner,

426
00:19:14,431 --> 00:19:17,040
can't you just be honest with us and 
tell us that,

427
00:19:17,060 --> 00:19:17,893
you know,
what you really think about Islam is a 

428
00:19:19,890 --> 00:19:20,723
religion.

429
00:19:20,910 --> 00:19:23,970
So I want immediate reaction.
I was to say to him,

430
00:19:23,971 --> 00:19:25,880
are you accusing me of lying?
Um,

431
00:19:26,390 --> 00:19:28,020
what do you mean?
Can I not be honest with you?

432
00:19:28,230 --> 00:19:30,000
Are you implying that I wasn't honest 
outside,

433
00:19:30,020 --> 00:19:32,760
they're on the platform and it became a 
very,

434
00:19:32,770 --> 00:19:33,603
a hostile exchange which ended,
that it didn't go any further and 

435
00:19:36,691 --> 00:19:38,320
everyone was a bit embarrassed around 
the table.

436
00:19:38,321 --> 00:19:39,154
We didn't really develop beyond that 
point and then we didn't speak for a 

437
00:19:42,630 --> 00:19:43,350
couple of years.
Um,

438
00:19:43,350 --> 00:19:45,450
and,
and so then Sam reached out to me when I

439
00:19:45,451 --> 00:19:48,610
think he'd watched me at the Richmond 
for,

440
00:19:49,250 --> 00:19:50,083
um,
when I was reunited again where they on 

441
00:19:52,740 --> 00:19:54,210
this time.
The good thing was,

442
00:19:54,211 --> 00:19:56,970
it wasn't a debate,
it was a conversation.

443
00:19:57,420 --> 00:19:58,970
And that's actually the richmond 
parameter.

444
00:19:59,010 --> 00:19:59,843
Thank you.
The people from the Richmond form of 

445
00:20:00,601 --> 00:20:01,434
watching this,
I want to thank them because the format 

446
00:20:03,361 --> 00:20:04,194
that they got,
the same moderator John Donvan 

447
00:20:05,550 --> 00:20:07,410
moderating the debate at the 
intelligence squared,

448
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:10,070
a exhaust earlier on occasion.

449
00:20:10,470 --> 00:20:11,303
Um,
uh,

450
00:20:11,310 --> 00:20:15,210
but instead they got a on myself and 
Emam Ralph who had been the,

451
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:16,353
uh,
the email or the main Manhattan mosque 

452
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:19,860
and instead of having a motion to 
debate,

453
00:20:19,861 --> 00:20:22,230
they just said it.
We only have to have a conversation.

454
00:20:23,250 --> 00:20:24,083
So that really allowed for me to be in 
the middle because he was arguing Islam 

455
00:20:28,531 --> 00:20:29,364
as a religion of peace.
I almost arguing it's not that it's a 

456
00:20:31,441 --> 00:20:34,380
religion of war instead and allowed me 
in the center to say,

457
00:20:34,381 --> 00:20:34,861
guys,
you know,

458
00:20:34,861 --> 00:20:37,530
actually I yarns got something right and
you've got something right.

459
00:20:37,531 --> 00:20:38,790
And there's actually something in the 
middle here.

460
00:20:39,690 --> 00:20:40,431
And uh,
that,

461
00:20:40,431 --> 00:20:44,040
that I think that conversation really 
set the precedent for what happened with

462
00:20:44,041 --> 00:20:46,440
Santa me afterwards because I think he 
saw that.

463
00:20:46,740 --> 00:20:48,610
I think almost really impressed with 
the,

464
00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:49,491
the,
the,

465
00:20:49,491 --> 00:20:49,971
the,
the,

466
00:20:49,971 --> 00:20:52,150
the tone that I talked with her in that 
conversation.

467
00:20:52,510 --> 00:20:54,150
And I was really happy with the 
research,

468
00:20:54,220 --> 00:20:55,053
with the way in which we,
she reciprocated my overtures to have 

469
00:20:58,780 --> 00:21:02,110
because I think that really laid the 
foundations for what happened next.

470
00:21:02,111 --> 00:21:03,670
And then Sam reached out to me and said,
hey,

471
00:21:03,940 --> 00:21:06,830
can we kind of have that type of 
conversation for my blog?

472
00:21:07,810 --> 00:21:08,231
Because,
you know,

473
00:21:08,231 --> 00:21:10,720
he interviews people on his podcast,
he publishes it on his blog.

474
00:21:11,460 --> 00:21:12,293
So I said,
well,

475
00:21:12,490 --> 00:21:13,210
yeah,
sure,

476
00:21:13,210 --> 00:21:13,900
we,
we,

477
00:21:13,900 --> 00:21:15,640
we sort of had this,
um,

478
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:16,793
uh,
exchange over the phone and he 

479
00:21:18,281 --> 00:21:19,780
transcribed it.
And I said,

480
00:21:19,781 --> 00:21:20,950
Sam,
this is actually really good.

481
00:21:20,951 --> 00:21:22,210
I don't think you should put it on your 
blog.

482
00:21:22,370 --> 00:21:24,100
I actually sensed this is a book that 
gets,

483
00:21:24,120 --> 00:21:24,953
you know,
that could really influence a lot of 

484
00:21:25,361 --> 00:21:26,690
people.
Um,

485
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:29,640
and so then he approached a Harvard and,
and uh,

486
00:21:29,740 --> 00:21:31,980
I called the editor in chief at Harvard,
uh,

487
00:21:32,070 --> 00:21:32,910
agreed.
And uh,

488
00:21:32,911 --> 00:21:33,744
that,
that's the story of the book which hits 

489
00:21:34,721 --> 00:21:35,554
the shelves in a week.

490
00:21:35,570 --> 00:21:36,300
Yeah.
So,

491
00:21:36,300 --> 00:21:38,180
so we'll talk about more about Sam in a 
second.

492
00:21:38,181 --> 00:21:41,090
But I think something interesting that 
you said about Ian is that,

493
00:21:41,091 --> 00:21:41,924
so I think a lot of your critics are a 
lot of the people that are critical of 

494
00:21:45,021 --> 00:21:48,250
everyone on your,
your side of this is that,

495
00:21:48,310 --> 00:21:50,930
that you guys all think exactly the same
thing,

496
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:52,580
but,
so I'm fascinated that.

497
00:21:52,620 --> 00:21:56,780
So you and I actually don't agree on 
certain elements of this.

498
00:21:57,660 --> 00:21:58,081
Well,
you see,

499
00:21:58,081 --> 00:22:01,650
that's the laziness and the knee jerk 
reaction,

500
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:04,350
the emotional reaction,
which is born of fear,

501
00:22:04,351 --> 00:22:05,184
the fear of dialogue and a fear of 
actually having conversations with 

502
00:22:07,231 --> 00:22:08,080
people,
um,

503
00:22:08,340 --> 00:22:09,173
that we may disagree with,
is that actually the best way to ignore 

504
00:22:12,751 --> 00:22:15,770
the consequences that dialogue can work.
It's a tiny share,

505
00:22:15,771 --> 00:22:18,330
everyone with the same brush and it's 
two,

506
00:22:18,540 --> 00:22:19,373
in fact,
you know,

507
00:22:19,390 --> 00:22:21,280
effectively slander everyone.
Um,

508
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:25,260
and that way that we are justifying to 
ourselves and those who are listening to

509
00:22:25,261 --> 00:22:28,950
us why dialogue isn't a good thing.
The truth is that,

510
00:22:29,210 --> 00:22:31,090
um,
even after this dial this,

511
00:22:31,091 --> 00:22:31,924
and there are probably many things that 
he and I don't see eye to eye on him 

512
00:22:34,651 --> 00:22:36,280
with a on as well.
And,

513
00:22:36,290 --> 00:22:37,123
uh,
but the important thing is in 

514
00:22:38,491 --> 00:22:41,710
recognizing that dialogue is a process.
It's not a,

515
00:22:41,970 --> 00:22:42,541
uh,
you know,

516
00:22:42,541 --> 00:22:44,610
you don't just snap your fingers and 
somebody agrees with you.

517
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:46,740
Um,
and democracy itself,

518
00:22:46,741 --> 00:22:47,574
by the way,
liberal democracies weren't born in a 

519
00:22:50,940 --> 00:22:51,773
day.
The reason why we use the word mature 

520
00:22:53,281 --> 00:22:55,650
democracies will be referred to 
countries like United States.

521
00:22:55,651 --> 00:22:56,484
The United Kingdom is because they've 
had centuries over which time they've 

522
00:22:59,371 --> 00:23:02,150
matured.
And that's what the kids use.

523
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:02,993
That analogy.
That's exactly what a dialogue with 

524
00:23:03,961 --> 00:23:06,420
people you disagree with,
is that they hadn't matures over time.

525
00:23:06,530 --> 00:23:07,363
Right?
So there's been a bunch of people you 

526
00:23:08,751 --> 00:23:09,584
can name them if you like.
We've talked about them a lot here and 

527
00:23:10,941 --> 00:23:11,774
I'm almost,
I'm almost tired of talking about them 

528
00:23:13,191 --> 00:23:17,090
at this point who are writing some 
pretty horrific things about you,

529
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:18,081
uh,
you know,

530
00:23:18,081 --> 00:23:18,914
the worst kind of slanderous stuff,
calling you names that if anyone on the 

531
00:23:22,491 --> 00:23:24,860
right called you,
they'd be condemned.

532
00:23:24,861 --> 00:23:26,240
And,
and rightfully so,

533
00:23:26,540 --> 00:23:27,373
and I'm seeing so much of this coming 
from the left and these are the people 

534
00:23:30,860 --> 00:23:31,693
who I thought would be the one standing 
up for all the things that you're 

535
00:23:34,791 --> 00:23:36,440
talking about here,
the words that you're talking about,

536
00:23:36,441 --> 00:23:38,360
conversation,
liberalism,

537
00:23:38,361 --> 00:23:40,520
all of these things,
uh,

538
00:23:40,521 --> 00:23:42,140
and you're getting it from the left.
What,

539
00:23:42,141 --> 00:23:43,190
what do you make about that?

540
00:23:43,790 --> 00:23:48,390
So let's away from the individuals and,
and look at the movement and,

541
00:23:48,391 --> 00:23:49,130
and,
you know,

542
00:23:49,130 --> 00:23:51,120
the individuals at the end of the day,
you know,

543
00:23:51,180 --> 00:23:52,013
they,
whatever they say about me and wherever 

544
00:23:53,061 --> 00:23:55,350
they are and have used a certainly one,
uh,

545
00:23:55,370 --> 00:23:56,203
as bad as I was when I was a 
revolutionary Islam is so I hope they 

546
00:23:58,431 --> 00:24:02,540
can change you're a good way.
What I believe in change and I hope that

547
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:05,510
people adapt turned into phase.
If they do change their views,

548
00:24:05,511 --> 00:24:07,700
I'd be perfectly happy to continue being
friends with them.

549
00:24:07,701 --> 00:24:08,534
And Reza Aslan,
who used to sit on my organization's 

550
00:24:10,581 --> 00:24:15,380
board in London as a member of our 
advisory council and we disbanded it,

551
00:24:15,420 --> 00:24:18,540
uh,
two years into a founding organization.

552
00:24:18,541 --> 00:24:20,780
So it hasn't existed for about five 
years.

553
00:24:21,010 --> 00:24:21,530
But,
you know,

554
00:24:21,530 --> 00:24:22,311
we used to,
another guy,

555
00:24:22,311 --> 00:24:26,570
we invited him to London for a foot,
he's spoken at my offices in London,

556
00:24:26,571 --> 00:24:26,990
acquit him.

557
00:24:26,990 --> 00:24:27,771
So,
you know,

558
00:24:27,771 --> 00:24:28,604
people change and I'm hoping,
and I'm hoping that we can resume of 

559
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:34,100
accordion,
a form of relationship with all of these

560
00:24:34,101 --> 00:24:34,934
guys.
You know,

561
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:35,833
I just think that if I can,
if I can be a go from where I was to 

562
00:24:38,860 --> 00:24:40,700
where I am,
I have faith in humanity.

563
00:24:41,510 --> 00:24:42,343
But it is important to talk about the 
concepts because that's the only way 

564
00:24:44,691 --> 00:24:47,990
people do change by the way is when,
as happened with me,

565
00:24:48,380 --> 00:24:52,970
is when those ideas are challenged and 
in a way that tries.

566
00:24:52,971 --> 00:24:54,680
And it's difficult.
We're all human beings.

567
00:24:54,681 --> 00:24:57,200
We all have emotions.
We will have egos,

568
00:24:57,380 --> 00:25:01,160
but in a way to challenge those ideas 
without making about the ego because,

569
00:25:01,161 --> 00:25:04,520
but actually just really making it about
the concepts themselves.

570
00:25:04,700 --> 00:25:05,533
And so what you've referred to is what 
I've come to refer to as the regressive 

571
00:25:07,791 --> 00:25:09,240
left.
And uh,

572
00:25:09,250 --> 00:25:11,870
and what I mean by the regressive left 
is because they're,

573
00:25:12,040 --> 00:25:14,510
you know,
not all of the people on the left wing,

574
00:25:15,110 --> 00:25:18,620
progressive leftists are just like not 
all Muslims are Islamists.

575
00:25:18,950 --> 00:25:23,420
And so what I mean by the regressive 
left Aba is this phenomenon of people on

576
00:25:23,421 --> 00:25:28,421
the left wing of the debate who are,
who see between their duty,

577
00:25:30,290 --> 00:25:32,880
their ideological duty to challenge,
uh,

578
00:25:32,881 --> 00:25:35,210
you know,
foreign policy mistakes,

579
00:25:35,570 --> 00:25:37,280
American and British foreign policy 
mistakes.

580
00:25:37,281 --> 00:25:38,114
So what they interpret as colonialism 
and the color and they conservativism 

581
00:25:43,010 --> 00:25:44,780
they see it as their duty is challenged 
this.

582
00:25:44,781 --> 00:25:49,520
And then they see another challenge 
which is theocracies and uh,

583
00:25:49,530 --> 00:25:51,800
and you know,
the Islamist ideology and they,

584
00:25:51,880 --> 00:25:54,050
they have come to the,
they've come to the,

585
00:25:54,090 --> 00:25:54,923
uh,
to the view that you can't challenge 

586
00:25:56,331 --> 00:25:59,870
both of these together because if you 
were to challenge his limits theocracy,

587
00:26:00,220 --> 00:26:02,990
your are your supporting neoconservative
foreign policy.

588
00:26:03,260 --> 00:26:04,490
So they,
in their minds,

589
00:26:04,520 --> 00:26:06,860
they prioritized.
They've said,

590
00:26:07,310 --> 00:26:08,143
you know,
neoconservative foreign policies and 

591
00:26:09,240 --> 00:26:10,073
bigger evil organized violence and chaos
in the form of military invasions is 

592
00:26:14,511 --> 00:26:17,660
worse than randomized nonstate act of 
violence and chaos.

593
00:26:18,050 --> 00:26:18,883
So we're going to go after,
if they believe they're engaged in a 

594
00:26:21,111 --> 00:26:22,910
war,
we're going to go after the,

595
00:26:22,940 --> 00:26:23,773
this is their mindset.
We're going to go after the organized 

596
00:26:25,310 --> 00:26:26,143
violence.
And the reason why sometimes you see 

597
00:26:28,191 --> 00:26:29,024
duplicity in their statements is because
they genuinely believe it's an 

598
00:26:31,371 --> 00:26:32,204
ideological war.
And so it's necessary to even engage in 

599
00:26:35,241 --> 00:26:39,230
propaganda to defeat this bigger evil,
but we believe in which is the organized

600
00:26:39,231 --> 00:26:42,320
violence and war now.
And so why I call them aggressive.

601
00:26:43,220 --> 00:26:44,053
It was because in doing so,
they make alliances with some of the 

602
00:26:46,531 --> 00:26:48,840
most regressive,
theocratic,

603
00:26:48,870 --> 00:26:50,460
fascist,
totalitarian,

604
00:26:50,760 --> 00:26:52,860
barbaric,
murdering,

605
00:26:53,130 --> 00:26:56,520
and justifies of murderous regimes 
across the world,

606
00:26:56,820 --> 00:26:57,600
right?
So,

607
00:26:57,600 --> 00:26:58,433
you know,
whether it's Hezbollah terrorist 

608
00:27:00,571 --> 00:27:03,950
organization that's county fighting 
alongside the dictator asset and,

609
00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:05,273
uh,
to fight with a against the Syrian 

610
00:27:07,051 --> 00:27:07,884
people.
And the reason I use the example of his 

611
00:27:09,240 --> 00:27:11,960
mom because the man has just been 
elected to the,

612
00:27:12,060 --> 00:27:14,340
to the Labour party leadership in the 
United Kingdom,

613
00:27:14,820 --> 00:27:15,270
who's,
uh,

614
00:27:15,270 --> 00:27:18,150
who's actually born on this regressive 
left phenomenon has,

615
00:27:18,180 --> 00:27:19,013
has been a historically has been very 
close to groups such as support groups 

616
00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:24,710
such as his Blah [inaudible].

617
00:27:25,410 --> 00:27:27,240
So that's why I'm siting in this 
example.

618
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:29,890
So when was his beloved,
whether it's Hummus,

619
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:31,033
you know,
on the one hand I can see the 

620
00:27:32,191 --> 00:27:33,024
frustration of people who want a,
a two state solution which includes a 

621
00:27:37,851 --> 00:27:38,684
secure free and independent Israel and a
secure and free and independent 

622
00:27:42,061 --> 00:27:42,894
Palestine.
But that frustration shouldn't 

623
00:27:44,070 --> 00:27:45,900
legitimize,
uh,

624
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:46,793
the uh,
supporting an organization that has at 

625
00:27:48,901 --> 00:27:49,734
the heart of its policy,
the legitimization of targeting 

626
00:27:52,381 --> 00:27:53,214
civilians.
And so what's happened is when I called 

627
00:27:55,251 --> 00:27:56,084
the regressive is that they've allied in
there are anti colonial prioritization 

628
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:01,073
with some of the most regressive 
theocratic organizations that are out 

629
00:28:03,841 --> 00:28:05,400
there in the world.
And then,

630
00:28:05,410 --> 00:28:06,740
and then,
and then they feel it,

631
00:28:06,741 --> 00:28:08,530
they feel that anyone who,
uh,

632
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:09,473
who criticizes those organizations is,
is by definition with the 

633
00:28:12,781 --> 00:28:14,550
neoconservatives.
So they must attack them.

634
00:28:14,551 --> 00:28:16,520
And that's what's going on.
And I take the view,

635
00:28:16,570 --> 00:28:17,403
actually you can criticize,
I opposed the Iraq war and the invasion 

636
00:28:20,401 --> 00:28:21,234
of Iraq from my jail cell in Egypt.
I have never supported the invasion of 

637
00:28:24,331 --> 00:28:27,630
Iraq.
I've never supported a conservativism on

638
00:28:27,631 --> 00:28:29,460
a member of the Liberal Democrats in the
UK.

639
00:28:29,461 --> 00:28:31,950
I've never been a member of any 
conservative party,

640
00:28:31,951 --> 00:28:33,700
I've never been a conservative,
uh,

641
00:28:33,740 --> 00:28:35,760
or,
or supporter of wars in that sense in my

642
00:28:35,761 --> 00:28:36,510
life.
So,

643
00:28:36,510 --> 00:28:39,210
so you can oppose those things at the 
same time.

644
00:28:39,211 --> 00:28:40,044
You can oppose a theocratic fascism.
We can haul two thoughts at the same 

645
00:28:44,310 --> 00:28:47,670
time and it's not impossible to do.
And I encourage everyone to try it.

646
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:48,633
Yeah.
I love how you wrap that together 

647
00:28:49,421 --> 00:28:52,280
because you're right,
it's two thoughts at the same time.

648
00:28:52,300 --> 00:28:54,370
And when I talked about this,
we're Sam,

649
00:28:54,371 --> 00:28:55,204
you know,
he was saying that they want to find 

650
00:28:55,841 --> 00:29:00,340
this nugget in you and once they find 
this thing that they say you have,

651
00:29:00,370 --> 00:29:02,860
not that you say you have it,
but that they say you have,

652
00:29:03,100 --> 00:29:07,060
then it's somehow discounts every other 
liberal principle that you have,

653
00:29:07,061 --> 00:29:07,894
which is why suddenly I'm hearing from 
them that they'll call Bill Maher is 

654
00:29:10,931 --> 00:29:11,764
suddenly a neo-con Bill Maher who has,
I think stood for every liberal 

655
00:29:14,951 --> 00:29:18,160
principle been against every war that I 
can possibly think of.

656
00:29:18,390 --> 00:29:19,223
Um,
and I have a suspicion that 

657
00:29:21,611 --> 00:29:23,740
unfortunately,
what these guys are doing,

658
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:26,320
I think for the reasons that you laid 
out very well,

659
00:29:26,590 --> 00:29:31,590
I think they're actually strengthening 
the extremists on both sides,

660
00:29:33,010 --> 00:29:33,843
right?
Because they are strengthening the 

661
00:29:35,141 --> 00:29:37,840
Islamist extremists because they're not 
challenging them.

662
00:29:38,050 --> 00:29:40,570
And then they're strengthening the,
uh,

663
00:29:40,690 --> 00:29:43,840
the extremists because they're saying 
they're making it seem like there's this

664
00:29:43,841 --> 00:29:46,480
one set of ideas that can't be talked 
about.

665
00:29:46,481 --> 00:29:49,030
And secular people want to talk about 
all ideas,

666
00:29:49,031 --> 00:29:49,864
right?

667
00:29:50,190 --> 00:29:50,941
Well,
if we,

668
00:29:50,941 --> 00:29:54,780
if we have come to refer to this as the 
voldemort effect,

669
00:29:54,781 --> 00:29:55,830
you know what I mean?
It's the,

670
00:29:56,210 --> 00:29:58,680
it's the Harry Potter books in which I'm
a j,

671
00:29:59,100 --> 00:30:02,820
a k,
she devices really clever mechanism.

672
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:08,440
The people in the story are so fearful 
of the evil of voldemort that two things

673
00:30:09,061 --> 00:30:09,894
happened.
One,

674
00:30:10,140 --> 00:30:12,170
they can't,
they don't read,

675
00:30:12,210 --> 00:30:13,980
they don't believe ultimately is 
actually alive.

676
00:30:14,070 --> 00:30:14,903
They think he's dead and they refuse to 
admit accept anyone that's telling them 

677
00:30:17,920 --> 00:30:19,650
to vote.
One still lives on.

678
00:30:19,651 --> 00:30:24,270
The second is that they're so petrified,
or this photo who they believe is dead,

679
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:26,070
uh,
that they can't even name him.

680
00:30:26,071 --> 00:30:28,020
So they refer to him as he who must not 
be named.

681
00:30:28,690 --> 00:30:29,523
Um,
so that's what I mean is the votable 

682
00:30:31,621 --> 00:30:32,940
effect.
And that leads to,

683
00:30:33,090 --> 00:30:33,923
you know,
when you can't name something that 

684
00:30:34,651 --> 00:30:38,790
actually is staring at you in the face 
and you're so scared of it,

685
00:30:39,150 --> 00:30:41,850
but you deny exists and you don't want 
to name it.

686
00:30:43,020 --> 00:30:45,390
That increases the hysteria.
So,

687
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:47,910
you know,
when president trump says we must defeat

688
00:30:47,911 --> 00:30:50,750
the evil ideology,
well which evil ideology,

689
00:30:50,760 --> 00:30:51,530
right?
You know,

690
00:30:51,530 --> 00:30:52,363
and so then you mean the average dude 
that stands up in Donald Trump's rally 

691
00:30:54,871 --> 00:30:57,030
and says,
when are we going to deal with America's

692
00:30:57,070 --> 00:30:59,370
Muslim problem?
Or Carson who says,

693
00:30:59,500 --> 00:31:00,333
you know,
he doesn't want a Muslim president when 

694
00:31:01,411 --> 00:31:03,570
they say these things because the evil 
ideology,

695
00:31:03,571 --> 00:31:06,300
when they hear that word,
what they mean by that is Islam.

696
00:31:06,301 --> 00:31:09,300
And by default,
every Muslim who identifies with Islam,

697
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:11,460
which is why they don't want to Muslim 
president.

698
00:31:11,670 --> 00:31:13,890
So what we're doing is by blurring those
lines,

699
00:31:14,100 --> 00:31:14,933
we're increasing that hysteria and 
actually the fee and the bigotry that 

700
00:31:18,601 --> 00:31:19,434
we're trying to avoid.
So what I argue is for those two 

701
00:31:21,781 --> 00:31:25,560
reasons,
and actually more importantly to empower

702
00:31:25,780 --> 00:31:30,120
a reforming Muslim voices within Muslim 
communities because the first victims of

703
00:31:30,330 --> 00:31:33,330
theocratic fascism will be those Muslims
themselves.

704
00:31:33,330 --> 00:31:35,040
It will be the Muslim women,
it will be the,

705
00:31:35,220 --> 00:31:36,260
uh,
the minorities.

706
00:31:36,270 --> 00:31:37,103
So the Yazidi women,
it will be the Coptic Christians in 

707
00:31:39,301 --> 00:31:41,160
Egypt,
it will be the liberal Muslims,

708
00:31:41,161 --> 00:31:42,750
it'll be the apostates,
the ex Muslims,

709
00:31:42,751 --> 00:31:45,420
there'll be the game Muslims and the 
lesbian Muslims.

710
00:31:45,421 --> 00:31:47,000
These are the ones who first suffer 
under,

711
00:31:47,010 --> 00:31:47,843
under the yoke of the aquatic fascism.
We need to also provide them with a 

712
00:31:50,991 --> 00:31:54,750
lexicon that they can deploy it in their
own internal reform debates.

713
00:31:54,900 --> 00:31:57,060
So if you don't,
if you don't recognize Islam,

714
00:31:57,061 --> 00:31:58,050
Islam,
what are they going to say?

715
00:31:58,051 --> 00:32:00,390
Is the problem when they're having these
debates within their communities,

716
00:32:00,391 --> 00:32:01,224
Islam,
the religion that's going to get them 

717
00:32:02,161 --> 00:32:05,070
killed immediately in the first place.
Aside from the,

718
00:32:05,190 --> 00:32:06,390
you know,
the intellectual point that.

719
00:32:06,391 --> 00:32:07,224
What do you mean by Islam and religion?
It's interpreted in a million different 

720
00:32:09,061 --> 00:32:09,894
ways.
God,

721
00:32:10,190 --> 00:32:10,300
yeah.

722
00:32:10,300 --> 00:32:11,133
That that's such a good handle on why 
this is so difficult because we're 

723
00:32:13,910 --> 00:32:16,100
talking about ideas,
we're talking about people,

724
00:32:16,101 --> 00:32:16,934
we're talking about religion,
we're talking about a political 

725
00:32:18,021 --> 00:32:21,520
movements is just so much at once.
Um,

726
00:32:21,590 --> 00:32:23,440
so just to sort of re,
uh,

727
00:32:23,810 --> 00:32:25,640
just to bring around this,
this part of it,

728
00:32:25,970 --> 00:32:29,690
um,
in terms of dealing with these people,

729
00:32:29,730 --> 00:32:32,300
the people that have been writing all 
these things and all that.

730
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:35,960
How,
how personally exhausting is it for you?

731
00:32:35,961 --> 00:32:37,460
Because I see and I've read,
you know,

732
00:32:37,461 --> 00:32:38,390
where Sam has said,
you know,

733
00:32:38,391 --> 00:32:40,550
he's not going to do anymore.
And he said to me,

734
00:32:40,551 --> 00:32:41,384
even that,
then suddenly it's like he has to say 

735
00:32:42,981 --> 00:32:46,310
something because it's not fun being 
lied about or slandered or smeared.

736
00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:48,500
And,
and as I said before you and away get it

737
00:32:48,501 --> 00:32:49,334
worse,
a tweet by one of these guys just this 

738
00:32:52,010 --> 00:32:56,390
week to you was about how he's going to 
report you to the Department of Homeland

739
00:32:56,390 --> 00:32:57,223
Security when you come to the United 
States because he doesn't want an x 

740
00:32:58,881 --> 00:33:00,920
terrorist here.
I mean this is really horrible.

741
00:33:00,921 --> 00:33:03,950
So how do you just deal with it on the,
on the personal level?

742
00:33:03,951 --> 00:33:04,910
It's exhausting,
right?

743
00:33:05,080 --> 00:33:05,913
You see,
the thing with this tweet is really 

744
00:33:07,931 --> 00:33:09,970
raises an interesting insight and again,
you know,

745
00:33:09,990 --> 00:33:12,520
I hope this guy changes his approach to 
this,

746
00:33:12,521 --> 00:33:16,240
but the interesting thing this raises 
is,

747
00:33:16,241 --> 00:33:20,320
is a liberal guy who extensively opposes
profiling at airports,

748
00:33:20,560 --> 00:33:22,330
which by the way,
I've always done,

749
00:33:22,570 --> 00:33:23,630
I've always been a.
I'm a,

750
00:33:23,810 --> 00:33:27,310
you can find more that I've done against
profiling then any of these voices,

751
00:33:27,311 --> 00:33:28,144
if you Google Google on youtube,
there's a whole debate on that on BBC 

752
00:33:31,031 --> 00:33:31,864
news night,
which is the flagship news show in the 

753
00:33:32,861 --> 00:33:37,300
UK against the left wing Labor policy 
member of parliament who also happens to

754
00:33:37,301 --> 00:33:40,090
be Muslim who was advocating profiling,
uh,

755
00:33:40,120 --> 00:33:42,700
five years ago.
And I was debating him on that.

756
00:33:42,701 --> 00:33:43,091
So,
you know,

757
00:33:43,091 --> 00:33:46,390
this is a city idea,
so I've always been against profiling.

758
00:33:46,391 --> 00:33:49,810
But so was this guy who sent the tweet 
you just referred to get.

759
00:33:50,290 --> 00:33:51,123
What's interesting is suddenly when 
somebody is breaking out of the group 

760
00:33:55,931 --> 00:33:59,500
thing,
think and disassociating themselves with

761
00:33:59,501 --> 00:34:01,090
the tribal identity that,
that,

762
00:34:01,170 --> 00:34:03,570
that we use to,
uh,

763
00:34:03,630 --> 00:34:06,140
to have this us and them kind of gaining
a,

764
00:34:06,160 --> 00:34:07,540
that we referred to earlier that,
you know,

765
00:34:07,541 --> 00:34:09,280
you're either with the neocons,
are you with us,

766
00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:10,433
uh,
and that kind of awesome them relies on 

767
00:34:12,491 --> 00:34:13,324
this tribal identity.
When someone breaks free from that 

768
00:34:16,301 --> 00:34:19,180
tribal identity,
refuses to belong here or there,

769
00:34:19,570 --> 00:34:20,403
suddenly you find that it's open season,
that all the principles that we use to 

770
00:34:24,131 --> 00:34:28,390
actually tarnish the neocons,
the neocons who want to profile Muslims,

771
00:34:28,510 --> 00:34:29,343
it's the neocons who are racist.
We're using that same racism against 

772
00:34:32,741 --> 00:34:35,110
those dissenting voices.
I was called a porch monkey,

773
00:34:35,350 --> 00:34:37,240
right?
I was called a native informant.

774
00:34:37,241 --> 00:34:41,200
I was called a Muslim by white non 
Muslims in this instance,

775
00:34:42,060 --> 00:34:42,893
really reputable people.
This isn't just random eggs on twitter 

776
00:34:44,821 --> 00:34:45,471
saying,
no,

777
00:34:45,471 --> 00:34:45,600
no,

778
00:34:45,600 --> 00:34:45,901
no,
no.

779
00:34:45,901 --> 00:34:46,734
These are,
these are journeys that worked for 

780
00:34:47,401 --> 00:34:48,234
established,
um,

781
00:34:48,270 --> 00:34:50,670
organizations with lightfoot established
blogs.

782
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:53,430
And then on top of that,
you've just mentioned somebody saying,

783
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:54,353
I hope dhs reads that department phone.
It reads your book before you come to 

784
00:34:57,961 --> 00:34:58,794
the states because I don't want an x 
terrorists coming into the into the 

785
00:35:01,740 --> 00:35:05,520
United States and put aside the fact I 
was never a terrorist.

786
00:35:05,940 --> 00:35:06,773
That's advocating profiling by somebody 
who a literally a day earlier had been 

787
00:35:11,911 --> 00:35:15,600
on CNN accusing Sam Harris of advocating
profiling.

788
00:35:16,140 --> 00:35:16,891
Yeah,
and so,

789
00:35:16,891 --> 00:35:20,200
so it's suddenly what happens is when 
you break away from that group,

790
00:35:20,220 --> 00:35:21,053
a kind of tribal group think it becomes 
open season and that's why I said 

791
00:35:25,291 --> 00:35:26,124
earlier that I think what's going on 
here is they genuinely believe they're 

792
00:35:28,981 --> 00:35:29,814
engaged in a war and so in a war,
all of these tactics become legitimate 

793
00:35:33,241 --> 00:35:35,730
because the objective is to win.
It's not to find the truth,

794
00:35:36,390 --> 00:35:37,710
and I think that's of the problem.

795
00:35:37,710 --> 00:35:38,543
That's why I think this dialogue and 
this conversation is so important 

796
00:35:40,830 --> 00:35:43,050
because what we do is we break down that
hostility,

797
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:44,033
so I keep referring.
That's why actually it's a lesson to 

798
00:35:45,661 --> 00:35:46,494
myself as well.
It's so important to remain polite with 

799
00:35:48,061 --> 00:35:51,090
these guys because whenever they say to 
me,

800
00:35:51,330 --> 00:35:52,163
if I.
If I reinforce that notion that they've 

801
00:35:53,851 --> 00:35:56,880
somehow managed to convince themselves 
that this is a war,

802
00:35:57,360 --> 00:35:58,193
and if I respond in that manner,
they will double down and they will 

803
00:36:00,481 --> 00:36:03,540
continue to act.
This is a war and that anything is,

804
00:36:03,541 --> 00:36:03,991
is,
uh,

805
00:36:03,991 --> 00:36:05,400
is permissible.
So,

806
00:36:05,430 --> 00:36:06,990
you know,
that's why I try and,

807
00:36:06,991 --> 00:36:09,420
and deescalated and I fail sometimes,
but you know,

808
00:36:09,530 --> 00:36:10,830
it's important for me to keep trying.

809
00:36:10,890 --> 00:36:12,480
Yeah.
I feel the same way I,

810
00:36:12,481 --> 00:36:13,314
I try as well from the little piece of 
this that I'm part of and I've tried to 

811
00:36:16,531 --> 00:36:19,680
engage some of these people in a 
respectful way and unfortunately,

812
00:36:19,681 --> 00:36:21,660
you know,
as Sam as illustrated quite well,

813
00:36:21,780 --> 00:36:22,613
it's hard to debate when you have your 
facts and then the person you're 

814
00:36:25,291 --> 00:36:28,680
debating is debating what they think you
say or what they want you to say.

815
00:36:28,810 --> 00:36:30,210
Not,
not what you,

816
00:36:30,270 --> 00:36:32,250
what you actually say.
Um,

817
00:36:32,490 --> 00:36:33,323
you know,
I think a little bit of this also is 

818
00:36:34,141 --> 00:36:39,141
what Bill Maher refers to as the bigotry
or the soft bigotry of low expectations.

819
00:36:40,230 --> 00:36:43,380
Do you feel that,
that somehow these people,

820
00:36:43,381 --> 00:36:46,530
and again I'm talking about the white 
liberals in this group,

821
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:47,633
that they think because you think 
differently than they want you to think 

822
00:36:51,770 --> 00:36:54,330
that that shows racism,
right?

823
00:36:55,790 --> 00:36:59,320
You could call right now into your show 
when you,

824
00:36:59,380 --> 00:37:00,700
when you do your production,
uh,

825
00:37:00,850 --> 00:37:05,060
an image of me talking me talking to Sam
Harris and,

826
00:37:05,070 --> 00:37:06,990
and being quarter porch monkey for it.
Yeah,

827
00:37:07,150 --> 00:37:09,550
I mean,
talking to Morgan Freeman now.

828
00:37:09,820 --> 00:37:14,380
Now the question I ask is why?
Why would none of these guys in and they

829
00:37:14,381 --> 00:37:15,214
haven't done?
So why would any of these guys not 

830
00:37:17,700 --> 00:37:20,650
cormier porch monkey for talking to 
Morgan Freeman?

831
00:37:20,690 --> 00:37:22,570
It's not call me his native informant.
No.

832
00:37:22,571 --> 00:37:25,720
Call me his porch monkey.
Yet when I'm talking to a white man,

833
00:37:27,090 --> 00:37:29,470
his porch monkey,
they call me his native informant.

834
00:37:29,530 --> 00:37:33,480
That's the racism of low expectations.
It's the assumption is that when a brown

835
00:37:33,490 --> 00:37:36,370
man is talking to a brown man,
it's a meeting of equals.

836
00:37:36,520 --> 00:37:38,570
But when a brown man is talking to a 
white land,

837
00:37:38,590 --> 00:37:39,423
the Brown man suddenly loses all agency 
and can't think for himself and his 

838
00:37:42,131 --> 00:37:43,450
following the white man's thoughts.

839
00:37:43,840 --> 00:37:44,673
And yet,
the irony is that I don't even use that 

840
00:37:46,331 --> 00:37:48,220
form of identity politics to describe 
people.

841
00:37:48,221 --> 00:37:51,490
I don't see people as white people,
Brown people I see effectively I use,

842
00:37:51,700 --> 00:37:54,100
I,
I like people to look at people as their

843
00:37:54,101 --> 00:37:54,671
values.
You know,

844
00:37:54,671 --> 00:37:56,560
if someone's liberal,
if someone's Islamist,

845
00:37:56,561 --> 00:37:59,860
if someone's a conservative,
that's how I look at people.

846
00:38:00,210 --> 00:38:01,520
Um,
because it,

847
00:38:01,530 --> 00:38:04,870
it tells me where I stand with them.
It's a much more than skin color does,

848
00:38:05,110 --> 00:38:08,830
but these are the people who are,
who are ostensibly anti racist,

849
00:38:09,010 --> 00:38:11,740
deploying that full of racism.
And you will find that,

850
00:38:11,741 --> 00:38:12,521
you know,
I tweeted the,

851
00:38:12,521 --> 00:38:15,250
an image of Morgan Freeman and nice 
yesterday.

852
00:38:15,251 --> 00:38:16,084
I'm putting it on my facebook page.
I have not once heard any reaction from 

853
00:38:19,181 --> 00:38:21,460
any of this,
a regressive left phenomenon,

854
00:38:21,700 --> 00:38:22,650
uh,
uh,

855
00:38:22,710 --> 00:38:23,860
in,
in the sense of being cold,

856
00:38:23,861 --> 00:38:27,250
his native informant or his house or his
porch monkey.

857
00:38:27,251 --> 00:38:28,084
It hasn't simply hasn't happened and 
that there is a best example of the 

858
00:38:31,151 --> 00:38:32,860
reverse racism of low expectations.

859
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:34,353
Yeah.
So I had been using the regressive left 

860
00:38:36,401 --> 00:38:37,920
also.
I just started using it in,

861
00:38:38,110 --> 00:38:40,750
in the last few weeks.
And a few of my friends that are in this

862
00:38:40,751 --> 00:38:42,490
space aren't thrilled with me because of
it,

863
00:38:42,790 --> 00:38:47,740
but I think what you're exposing there 
is a fatal flaw of progressivism because

864
00:38:47,741 --> 00:38:51,100
they view things in the prism of 
identity politics.

865
00:38:51,310 --> 00:38:52,143
It's very hard to extricate someone with
a separate idea or someone that doesn't 

866
00:38:56,471 --> 00:39:00,880
fit the cliche and you're literally a 
walking,

867
00:39:00,881 --> 00:39:03,950
breathing example of that,
which is explains why you get the,

868
00:39:03,980 --> 00:39:05,020
the shit that you do.

869
00:39:05,680 --> 00:39:06,513
And it's important to mention at the 
same time when I'm sitting there on a 

870
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:12,050
tweet out that I,
um,

871
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:15,530
I was Morgan Freeman in the mosque 
explaining,

872
00:39:15,550 --> 00:39:16,383
you know,
having a conversation about the 

873
00:39:16,731 --> 00:39:19,280
difference between Islam and Islamism.
It is important to mentioned.

874
00:39:19,700 --> 00:39:22,610
But at the same time I got lots of 
reaction from people saying,

875
00:39:22,890 --> 00:39:24,560
uh,
the difference between Islam and Islam.

876
00:39:24,561 --> 00:39:28,220
Islam is in your head.
I'm actually in the same thing.

877
00:39:28,221 --> 00:39:30,110
So there's also that side of the 
reaction,

878
00:39:30,111 --> 00:39:31,310
you know,
I'd get it from that side too.

879
00:39:31,311 --> 00:39:35,090
People insisting that Islam is what they
believe it to be,

880
00:39:35,300 --> 00:39:36,133
which is what are kind of in the.
And then I'm just engaged myself in a 

881
00:39:39,441 --> 00:39:41,600
form of apology for,
for what Islam is.

882
00:39:41,870 --> 00:39:42,640
And so it's,
it's,

883
00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:44,870
it's difficult to try and strike this 
balance where,

884
00:39:45,180 --> 00:39:45,741
um,
you know,

885
00:39:45,741 --> 00:39:50,080
we need honesty in this conversation.
We need people to accept that there's a,

886
00:39:50,230 --> 00:39:51,063
a problem with Islamist extremism and 
there's also in fact a challenge in 

887
00:39:55,221 --> 00:39:56,190
dealing with,
uh,

888
00:39:56,300 --> 00:39:57,133
taking Islam out of its medieval heyday,
the paradigms and the theological 

889
00:40:00,171 --> 00:40:01,004
paradigms that were developed in the 
earlier that we simply haven't moved on 

890
00:40:03,081 --> 00:40:03,914
from.

891
00:40:04,280 --> 00:40:05,113
And,
and actually that means that a whole 

892
00:40:07,371 --> 00:40:09,830
bunch of Muslims.
So the Islam is obviously don't write me

893
00:40:09,980 --> 00:40:10,813
a whole bunch of traditionalist,
non Islamist conservative Muslims don't 

894
00:40:14,091 --> 00:40:14,924
like me because I talk about reforming 
the interpretation and then a whole 

895
00:40:17,331 --> 00:40:18,164
bunch of anti Muslim people on the other
side who want me to apostasizes don't 

896
00:40:20,661 --> 00:40:23,590
write me because.
Because I say Islam can be interpreted a

897
00:40:23,670 --> 00:40:25,400
and they want me to say that Islam is 
evil.

898
00:40:25,930 --> 00:40:26,331
Uh,
so,

899
00:40:26,331 --> 00:40:27,164
you know,
you ended up getting kind of stuck in 

900
00:40:27,711 --> 00:40:29,690
this middle of this.
It requires a lot of patients.

901
00:40:29,800 --> 00:40:30,431
Yeah.
Well,

902
00:40:30,431 --> 00:40:31,930
I guess if you have a lot of people 
hating,

903
00:40:31,931 --> 00:40:33,460
you might be telling the truth.

904
00:40:33,850 --> 00:40:37,240
How about you?
You don't need to be a believer in Islam

905
00:40:37,510 --> 00:40:38,343
to concede the point,
which is the point I was making with 

906
00:40:40,391 --> 00:40:41,224
Sam,
who I think has since shifted in his 

907
00:40:42,221 --> 00:40:45,430
view and he's accepted that he's feeling
has changed somewhat on this point.

908
00:40:45,820 --> 00:40:46,653
You don't need to be a believer in the 
religion of Islam to concede that texts 

909
00:40:50,590 --> 00:40:53,230
can be interpreted.
It's not as simple as saying,

910
00:40:53,231 --> 00:40:54,064
I'm going to go to a restaurant and 
order a lobster and if you bring me a 

911
00:40:56,500 --> 00:40:57,333
chicken,
why did you bring the chicken when I 

912
00:40:58,730 --> 00:41:00,850
wanted a lobster?
Because it's got the menu says mobster.

913
00:41:01,150 --> 00:41:01,983
You're ordering one thing that what 
we're talking about is a Amandla bit 

914
00:41:05,380 --> 00:41:06,213
like a car manual.
When something's gone wrong in the 

915
00:41:07,241 --> 00:41:11,140
engine and reading the whole thing or 
working out what the diagnosis is,

916
00:41:11,260 --> 00:41:13,480
you know where the particular relevant 
parts are,

917
00:41:13,481 --> 00:41:14,560
how you put them together.

918
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:16,870
When you're talking about complex ideas 
like that,

919
00:41:16,900 --> 00:41:20,590
like interpreting scripture and adapting
them to the time and space,

920
00:41:20,591 --> 00:41:22,120
we find ourselves in,
you know,

921
00:41:22,121 --> 00:41:22,954
by definition,
it's an exercise in interpretation and 

922
00:41:24,941 --> 00:41:26,620
that's why even with the US 
Constitution,

923
00:41:26,621 --> 00:41:27,454
you've got the same document being used 
as a source for pro choice and pro life 

924
00:41:31,151 --> 00:41:31,984
people or pro gun laws and gun 
restriction people using the very same 

925
00:41:35,691 --> 00:41:36,524
document to make their arguments because
the dispute is over what that document 

926
00:41:39,081 --> 00:41:40,970
means in this day and age in the first 
place.

927
00:41:41,490 --> 00:41:42,323
And so you don't really need to believe 
in the scripture to concede that there 

928
00:41:44,961 --> 00:41:46,970
is no one definitive reading of 
Shakespeare.

929
00:41:46,971 --> 00:41:47,804
There's no one definitive reading of the
Bible and there's no one definitive 

930
00:41:49,911 --> 00:41:50,744
reading of the Koran.

931
00:41:50,810 --> 00:41:51,500
Yeah.
Alright.

932
00:41:51,500 --> 00:41:53,930
So one more piece on this portion of all
this,

933
00:41:54,110 --> 00:41:56,210
what do you make of the term 
Islamophobia?

934
00:41:56,470 --> 00:41:57,303
Uh,
because to me the term itself has a lot 

935
00:42:00,861 --> 00:42:01,694
of problems with it because I don't 
think people fear Islam as in the 

936
00:42:05,091 --> 00:42:07,310
religion.
They fear if there,

937
00:42:07,311 --> 00:42:10,640
if there is a fear.
For some people it's the actions.

938
00:42:10,730 --> 00:42:14,000
They fear the actions that people are 
taking in the name of the religion,

939
00:42:14,001 --> 00:42:14,834
and again,
that I know that can be confusing for 

940
00:42:16,251 --> 00:42:18,620
people because that's the idea verse the
people,

941
00:42:18,770 --> 00:42:22,070
but I do see this meme of calling 
everyone in Islamophobia and it goes,

942
00:42:22,071 --> 00:42:24,290
of course,
to a lot of things we've talked about so

943
00:42:24,291 --> 00:42:25,470
far,
but I fear that,

944
00:42:25,480 --> 00:42:30,170
that their use of that word also is 
creating a real,

945
00:42:30,171 --> 00:42:31,004
uh,
a real backlash to what they want to 

946
00:42:32,991 --> 00:42:33,824
accomplish.

947
00:42:34,270 --> 00:42:34,870
Well,
the sea,

948
00:42:34,870 --> 00:42:37,030
often this word is deployed to silence.
You know,

949
00:42:37,040 --> 00:42:37,873
it's used to kind of muzzle the debate 
when people have every right to 

950
00:42:42,130 --> 00:42:46,240
criticize and scrutinize and satirize 
any idea whether it's Christianity,

951
00:42:47,230 --> 00:42:48,940
science,
whether it's religion,

952
00:42:48,941 --> 00:42:51,040
whether it's Islam,
any idea,

953
00:42:51,220 --> 00:42:53,100
um,
is open to scrutiny in the patent.

954
00:42:53,101 --> 00:42:53,970
That's the,
the,

955
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:54,833
the essence of progress.
It's how all societies have ended up 

956
00:42:56,651 --> 00:42:58,090
where they are today.
Um,

957
00:42:58,270 --> 00:43:00,460
every innovator for their day was a 
blast.

958
00:43:00,470 --> 00:43:01,303
Fema,
Galileo questioned things that he was 

959
00:43:03,881 --> 00:43:08,710
called a heretic for what's considered a
heretic for theory of evolution.

960
00:43:09,100 --> 00:43:10,010
And so,
um,

961
00:43:10,120 --> 00:43:10,953
you know,
and even profits were heritage acts 

962
00:43:13,480 --> 00:43:15,250
against the old religion.
Um,

963
00:43:15,280 --> 00:43:16,180
you know,
whether that's Mohammed,

964
00:43:16,181 --> 00:43:16,990
Jesus,
Moses,

965
00:43:16,990 --> 00:43:20,110
so at the end of the day,
if it wasn't for blast for me,

966
00:43:20,140 --> 00:43:21,550
if it wasn't for,
in other words,

967
00:43:21,580 --> 00:43:24,220
questioning established norms and 
heresy,

968
00:43:24,460 --> 00:43:27,520
we wouldn't have progress.
So to use the word Islamophobia,

969
00:43:27,521 --> 00:43:28,354
to silence any scrutiny of an idea would
be to hinder this debate and the 

970
00:43:32,681 --> 00:43:34,300
progress that is needed in this debate.

971
00:43:34,540 --> 00:43:35,373
I don't like the term for that reason 
and I think it's deployed to often 

972
00:43:38,140 --> 00:43:41,630
against people who are simply 
questioning whether the,

973
00:43:41,940 --> 00:43:43,780
whether Islam needs to be reformed or 
not,

974
00:43:43,990 --> 00:43:46,660
or whether Islam.
Islam has a relationship to Islam,

975
00:43:46,661 --> 00:43:48,460
which of course it does.
You know,

976
00:43:48,490 --> 00:43:50,020
Islam.
Islam is an offshoot of Islam.

977
00:43:50,021 --> 00:43:50,854
It's wrong to say it's got nothing to do
with Islam and so people don't have in 

978
00:43:54,010 --> 00:43:56,980
asking these questions to deal with some
very real problems in the world.

979
00:43:56,981 --> 00:43:59,080
I've been called Islamophobes and that's
actually unfair.

980
00:43:59,470 --> 00:44:03,130
I prefer the word anti Muslim bigot.
There is such a thing as our anti Muslim

981
00:44:03,131 --> 00:44:07,270
bigotry.
There are people who like Carson,

982
00:44:07,271 --> 00:44:11,020
who don't believe in a,
in perhaps don't believe in evolution,

983
00:44:11,050 --> 00:44:13,480
but they also don't want Muslim 
presidents of the United States.

984
00:44:13,500 --> 00:44:15,120
Well,
what do you do with a neuroscientist who

985
00:44:15,121 --> 00:44:17,910
doesn't believe in evolution?
Those things don't seem like they should

986
00:44:17,911 --> 00:44:18,350
add up,

987
00:44:18,350 --> 00:44:19,580
but it kind of indicates,
you know,

988
00:44:19,640 --> 00:44:20,270
they,
they're.

989
00:44:20,270 --> 00:44:22,250
So there is something about people that 
have a,

990
00:44:22,380 --> 00:44:23,213
they want to discriminate against people
like me because of the religion I was 

991
00:44:25,671 --> 00:44:26,361
born into.
Right?

992
00:44:26,361 --> 00:44:27,170
That,
that's,

993
00:44:27,170 --> 00:44:28,003
that's anti Muslim bigotry,
but that's very different to 

994
00:44:30,260 --> 00:44:32,920
scrutinizing the idea and that's why I 
developed this maximum,

995
00:44:32,930 --> 00:44:36,540
which again,
I'm the dialogue with Sam and that isn't

996
00:44:36,541 --> 00:44:37,920
no idea,
uh,

997
00:44:37,950 --> 00:44:38,783
should be or is ever above scrutiny.
No idea is above screws and even though 

998
00:44:41,641 --> 00:44:42,474
people have been a dignity.
And I think that really nicely 

999
00:44:44,671 --> 00:44:46,770
summarizes where we should stand on this
debate.

1000
00:44:46,850 --> 00:44:47,683
Yeah.
That's actually a great segue for my 

1001
00:44:48,621 --> 00:44:50,330
next question,
which is,

1002
00:44:50,600 --> 00:44:51,433
what has the reaction from just sort of 
the mainstream Muslim community in 

1003
00:44:56,091 --> 00:44:58,250
England been to you?
Because when I,

1004
00:44:58,251 --> 00:45:00,830
even when I tweeted out that we were 
going to sit down and do this,

1005
00:45:01,340 --> 00:45:02,173
the majority of it was positive.
Now obviously we have a certain amount 

1006
00:45:04,341 --> 00:45:05,174
of people that follow both of us and 
know what we think about things that 

1007
00:45:07,010 --> 00:45:09,110
enjoy what we do.
So that's expected.

1008
00:45:09,290 --> 00:45:11,090
But I did get some people that said,
oh,

1009
00:45:11,091 --> 00:45:11,670
you know,
it was,

1010
00:45:11,670 --> 00:45:13,820
it was this porch monkey mentality,
oh,

1011
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:17,840
he's just doing this for,
for money and affection of white people.

1012
00:45:17,841 --> 00:45:20,630
And a lot of that,
what I think is pure nonsense.

1013
00:45:20,631 --> 00:45:21,464
But what,
what about the mainstream Muslim 

1014
00:45:22,761 --> 00:45:23,960
community,
uh,

1015
00:45:23,990 --> 00:45:25,130
that you're around every day?

1016
00:45:26,260 --> 00:45:26,731
Well,
look,

1017
00:45:26,731 --> 00:45:29,050
you know,
mainstream Muslims on Islamists,

1018
00:45:29,080 --> 00:45:29,913
they are conservative,
but they're not Islamists and there's 

1019
00:45:31,491 --> 00:45:33,420
certainly not jihadists.
Uh,

1020
00:45:33,480 --> 00:45:34,530
and so,
uh,

1021
00:45:34,750 --> 00:45:36,820
while they're not going to do,
even if they disagreed with me,

1022
00:45:37,090 --> 00:45:37,990
is they're not gonna,
you know,

1023
00:45:37,991 --> 00:45:41,280
they're not going to basically attack me
for it or,

1024
00:45:41,380 --> 00:45:45,130
or launch into a tirade at home with 
them even if they disagreed.

1025
00:45:45,430 --> 00:45:46,263
Now I'm,
I'm very realistic about where I stand 

1026
00:45:48,340 --> 00:45:49,173
among my own religious communities.
And that's because if I had just 

1027
00:45:52,511 --> 00:45:54,460
restricted myself to challenging 
Islamism,

1028
00:45:54,520 --> 00:45:58,030
I probably would have had the support of
the other welding majority,

1029
00:45:58,031 --> 00:45:58,864
the mainstream of Muslims,
but the other alarming mainstream also 

1030
00:46:02,081 --> 00:46:04,900
happened to be in social and religious 
matters,

1031
00:46:04,990 --> 00:46:05,823
conservative with a small seat.
And I challenged that to I call for 

1032
00:46:09,371 --> 00:46:12,700
reform in our approach and 
interpretation of the scripture.

1033
00:46:12,940 --> 00:46:15,560
I'm a liberal socially,
uh,

1034
00:46:15,580 --> 00:46:16,413
as well as politically and um,
and I mentioned I'm a member of the 

1035
00:46:18,970 --> 00:46:21,130
Liberal Democrats in the United Kingdom,
which is the centrist party there.

1036
00:46:21,670 --> 00:46:22,810
Um,
and so,

1037
00:46:22,960 --> 00:46:23,793
you know,
I have very openly supported a lot of 

1038
00:46:26,711 --> 00:46:29,490
social reform on these issues.
And I think that,

1039
00:46:29,510 --> 00:46:33,280
you know,
we have some acid Quilliam who advocated

1040
00:46:33,281 --> 00:46:34,114
for the reconciliation of evolution,
Islamic create these granite creed that 

1041
00:46:37,541 --> 00:46:39,540
was incredibly controversial when he did
something,

1042
00:46:39,550 --> 00:46:41,470
he was kicked out of his mosque,
uh,

1043
00:46:41,500 --> 00:46:43,470
for that.
And that's not an Islamic mosque,

1044
00:46:43,471 --> 00:46:47,190
it's a conservative mosque.
And so the reason that,

1045
00:46:47,191 --> 00:46:47,681
that,
um,

1046
00:46:47,681 --> 00:46:48,514
that you will sense a lot of backlash,
it's because we take on the twin 

1047
00:46:51,911 --> 00:46:53,540
challenges of,
uh,

1048
00:46:53,710 --> 00:46:54,543
wanting to again,
another sort of maximum is that what we 

1049
00:46:57,101 --> 00:46:59,890
want to do is that Islam is a,
must be intellectually terminated,

1050
00:47:00,260 --> 00:47:02,740
uh,
whereas Islam needs to be reformed.

1051
00:47:03,010 --> 00:47:05,350
But that's the twin challenge that faces
us.

1052
00:47:05,590 --> 00:47:08,920
And it means that obviously because no 
change is seamless,

1053
00:47:08,980 --> 00:47:13,750
all change is painful.
A lot of people get upset when they kind

1054
00:47:13,751 --> 00:47:15,850
of hear some of the things we say,
but that's the nature of change.

1055
00:47:15,851 --> 00:47:16,480
I mean,
you know,

1056
00:47:16,480 --> 00:47:18,020
that's how society has changed.
It's,

1057
00:47:18,030 --> 00:47:18,480
it's,
it's,

1058
00:47:18,480 --> 00:47:19,300
it's normal.

1059
00:47:19,300 --> 00:47:21,130
Yeah.
I know you might be slightly hesitant to

1060
00:47:21,131 --> 00:47:21,964
talk about this,
but can I ask you just in terms of your 

1061
00:47:23,291 --> 00:47:25,590
own personal safety,
I'm sure you are.

1062
00:47:25,600 --> 00:47:27,400
You are threatened.
I know that,

1063
00:47:27,490 --> 00:47:30,640
that a lot of the other people in this 
from bill to Sam,

1064
00:47:30,641 --> 00:47:33,850
too many others have a certain amount of
threats that they deal with from,

1065
00:47:33,851 --> 00:47:35,140
from all fronts.
By the way,

1066
00:47:35,350 --> 00:47:36,880
you know,
I think from someone like Sam,

1067
00:47:36,881 --> 00:47:38,980
it comes from people from radical 
Christians too.

1068
00:47:38,981 --> 00:47:39,814
So I don't even,
I don't even want to make this about 

1069
00:47:41,020 --> 00:47:44,510
Islam or Muslims particularly,
uh,

1070
00:47:44,590 --> 00:47:45,423
but people I think need to understand 
that you put yourself at great risk to 

1071
00:47:49,061 --> 00:47:50,710
talk about the things that you're 
talking about,

1072
00:47:50,711 --> 00:47:51,544
right?

1073
00:47:51,760 --> 00:47:53,670
Yeah.
I don't want to dwell on this,

1074
00:47:53,671 --> 00:47:57,170
but it's not exactly the safest 
occupation in the world.

1075
00:47:57,600 --> 00:47:58,433
So there's a lot going on in,
in England politically right now in 

1076
00:48:00,871 --> 00:48:02,850
Jeremy Corbyn,
who you mentioned earlier,

1077
00:48:02,851 --> 00:48:03,684
is now head of the Labor Party.
What's the general sense of the 

1078
00:48:05,911 --> 00:48:08,250
political atmosphere in England right 
now?

1079
00:48:08,251 --> 00:48:11,070
Because in America we get very,
very little.

1080
00:48:11,280 --> 00:48:12,900
Even if I just flick on BBC for a 
second,

1081
00:48:12,901 --> 00:48:15,300
I mean we have very,
very little of what's going on with,

1082
00:48:15,320 --> 00:48:17,160
with basically our biggest ally in the 
world.

1083
00:48:18,050 --> 00:48:18,883
Yeah.
It's interesting because we are facing 

1084
00:48:20,341 --> 00:48:21,174
the inlaws on what's happening here with
the phenomenon of the rise of Donald 

1085
00:48:24,571 --> 00:48:25,404
trump.
We've got Jeremy Corbyn who is populist 

1086
00:48:30,451 --> 00:48:31,284
in the way that trump is on the left 
wing of politics and it's the same 

1087
00:48:35,550 --> 00:48:36,383
discourse.
And actually that's why you have the 

1088
00:48:37,621 --> 00:48:41,950
horse horseshoe theory of politics.
You know that actually ultimately you're

1089
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:42,833
left and right.
They come and they end up when they go 

1090
00:48:44,281 --> 00:48:46,020
to the extreme,
that meeting in the middle anyway.

1091
00:48:46,910 --> 00:48:48,150
Yeah,
Mussolini's Fascist,

1092
00:48:48,151 --> 00:48:50,490
and I'm not calling a fascist by any 
means,

1093
00:48:50,491 --> 00:48:51,324
but mostly in his fascism was a left 
wing phenomenon that emerged into 

1094
00:48:54,670 --> 00:48:57,090
totalitarian fascism.
So they ended up meeting.

1095
00:48:57,390 --> 00:48:59,880
And the reason that,
so if you look at corbion and trump,

1096
00:49:00,270 --> 00:49:03,750
what they both have in common is they're
antiestablishment approach.

1097
00:49:03,950 --> 00:49:07,320
Um,
is that a total disdain for politics and

1098
00:49:07,321 --> 00:49:08,670
the way that things have been going on?

1099
00:49:08,750 --> 00:49:09,180
Um,
they,

1100
00:49:09,180 --> 00:49:12,600
they want to change the status quo,
that playing on popular anger,

1101
00:49:12,840 --> 00:49:15,120
which in many instances is there for 
legitimate reasons.

1102
00:49:15,121 --> 00:49:17,610
But in other instances it's playing up 
the identity politics.

1103
00:49:17,880 --> 00:49:20,610
They identify the other.
So in trump's case,

1104
00:49:20,611 --> 00:49:24,330
the Mexicans and the wall that the city 
idea of building a wall that he wants,

1105
00:49:24,840 --> 00:49:25,673
you know,
identifying the other and allying with 

1106
00:49:27,001 --> 00:49:31,260
some unsavory people to achieve that.
It's all part of the parcel of,

1107
00:49:31,620 --> 00:49:32,453
of the politics of our,
of our times and across Europe were 

1108
00:49:34,771 --> 00:49:39,450
witnessing this phenomenon with the rise
of far right populist parties.

1109
00:49:39,451 --> 00:49:42,810
And in Greece we had golden dawn,
now we got series series a,

1110
00:49:42,811 --> 00:49:45,590
which is a far left populist party.
And uh,

1111
00:49:45,630 --> 00:49:46,463
in Scotland we had the Scottish 
nationalists who wanted to break away 

1112
00:49:48,631 --> 00:49:51,060
from the United Kingdom and the other 
for them where the English.

1113
00:49:51,420 --> 00:49:52,290
So,
um,

1114
00:49:52,570 --> 00:49:53,403
because for whatever reason people are 
feeling particularly vulnerable and 

1115
00:49:56,581 --> 00:49:57,414
insecure,
they are rallying around identity 

1116
00:49:59,101 --> 00:50:01,650
politics and defining themselves against
somebody else.

1117
00:50:01,890 --> 00:50:04,800
And I think that's a particularly,
it's a very unhelpful,

1118
00:50:04,980 --> 00:50:08,610
unhealthy way to engage in politics and 
it leads to more division,

1119
00:50:08,880 --> 00:50:10,410
which is what we see playing out across 
a lot.

1120
00:50:10,550 --> 00:50:12,140
Yeah,
not only do we see it playing out across

1121
00:50:12,141 --> 00:50:12,971
the world,
but now you know,

1122
00:50:12,971 --> 00:50:13,804
we have this massive refugee crisis 
which you guys in Europe or are having 

1123
00:50:16,641 --> 00:50:19,970
to deal with much more than we are in 
the states now.

1124
00:50:19,971 --> 00:50:20,804
Europe already has a huge problem with 
integrating their immigrants as a 

1125
00:50:24,261 --> 00:50:27,080
general rule a,
especially in Muslim.

1126
00:50:27,530 --> 00:50:28,460
Right?
So what,

1127
00:50:28,500 --> 00:50:29,333
what do you make of what England or what
the rest of the EU should be doing or 

1128
00:50:33,201 --> 00:50:35,930
can be doing with the refugee situation?

1129
00:50:37,030 --> 00:50:39,820
I think the important thing is 
integration.

1130
00:50:40,570 --> 00:50:44,080
I would caution people and they will be 
in the United Kingdom.

1131
00:50:44,081 --> 00:50:47,270
We are overdue isis attack.
So not if,

1132
00:50:47,271 --> 00:50:51,940
but when Isis chooses and decides it's 
capable of striking in the UK,

1133
00:50:52,270 --> 00:50:54,970
I would urge people not to blame the 
refugees.

1134
00:50:55,300 --> 00:50:57,520
These are people who are,
uh,

1135
00:50:57,550 --> 00:50:58,383
in some cases who have fought isis in 
Syria and Iraq and then a flat since 

1136
00:51:01,781 --> 00:51:02,614
then or in other cases were fleeing for 
their lives because they disagree with 

1137
00:51:05,831 --> 00:51:10,360
everything that Isis is doing.
Of course among them there may be one or

1138
00:51:10,361 --> 00:51:11,194
two fighters and uh,
but that's neither here nor there 

1139
00:51:13,941 --> 00:51:18,310
because 1000 born and raised British 
citizens of concert joined isis anyway.

1140
00:51:18,311 --> 00:51:19,300
So they're,
they're,

1141
00:51:19,330 --> 00:51:22,540
they're finding it easy enough to 
recruit from UK born citizens,

1142
00:51:22,541 --> 00:51:24,460
let alone having to sneak them in with 
refugees.

1143
00:51:24,670 --> 00:51:25,503
So if there are attacks,
I would urge people not to blame these 

1144
00:51:27,161 --> 00:51:29,440
poor desperate refugees who need our 
help.

1145
00:51:29,440 --> 00:51:30,273
And our sympathy and our understanding 
and what I would consider what I would 

1146
00:51:33,521 --> 00:51:34,930
say is important to consider for 
governments.

1147
00:51:34,931 --> 00:51:36,640
On the other hand,
is not to repeat the,

1148
00:51:37,470 --> 00:51:38,303
is when,
what you mentioned integration wasn't 

1149
00:51:41,561 --> 00:51:42,394
seen as important.
And so what we ended up developing in 

1150
00:51:44,351 --> 00:51:48,910
Europe and in Britain,
I can speak to what he's self segregated

1151
00:51:49,660 --> 00:51:52,400
communities that didn't mix with one 
another and they,

1152
00:51:52,450 --> 00:51:53,283
they grew up,
you know,

1153
00:51:53,320 --> 00:51:54,153
it's possible in 2015 to be born and 
raised in London as a Muslim teenager 

1154
00:51:59,350 --> 00:52:01,420
and not have a single mom,
Muslim friend,

1155
00:52:01,610 --> 00:52:03,610
nor a single friend from the opposite 
sex.

1156
00:52:04,060 --> 00:52:07,780
And I just think that's not a healthy 
psychological state to be in.

1157
00:52:07,960 --> 00:52:09,700
So I would encourage governments to have
really,

1158
00:52:09,701 --> 00:52:11,770
really robust and strong integration 
policies.

1159
00:52:11,920 --> 00:52:12,753
Yeah.
Uh,

1160
00:52:12,820 --> 00:52:16,840
do you think that that's even possible 
because they're already dealing with the

1161
00:52:16,841 --> 00:52:20,260
integration problem that exists?
It seems to me that the conversation has

1162
00:52:20,261 --> 00:52:22,690
been dumbed down to the point where if 
you say anything,

1163
00:52:22,691 --> 00:52:25,420
if you were to say,
well we shouldn't bring in more refugees

1164
00:52:25,421 --> 00:52:28,390
right now that people would immediately 
call you racist,

1165
00:52:28,600 --> 00:52:31,660
which the truth probably is somewhere 
between,

1166
00:52:31,810 --> 00:52:32,643
you know,
there's obviously a certain amount of 

1167
00:52:32,981 --> 00:52:34,870
people that are going to be xenophobic 
no matter what.

1168
00:52:35,050 --> 00:52:37,840
And then there are also some legitimate 
concerns about what the,

1169
00:52:37,870 --> 00:52:41,350
what this can do to societies.
But we so rarely have this conversation,

1170
00:52:41,351 --> 00:52:42,184
right?

1171
00:52:42,670 --> 00:52:43,330
Yeah.
And it's,

1172
00:52:43,330 --> 00:52:45,280
you know,
at the end of the day I'm,

1173
00:52:45,970 --> 00:52:46,803
the immigration conversation is a bit 
like the Islam isn't conversation then 

1174
00:52:49,361 --> 00:52:52,480
it's immediately shot down and 
accusations of bigotry.

1175
00:52:53,010 --> 00:52:53,950
The first,
you know,

1176
00:52:54,040 --> 00:52:55,930
a lead costs,
if you like,

1177
00:52:56,020 --> 00:52:57,970
of those who want to shut that 
conversation down.

1178
00:52:58,460 --> 00:52:59,293
It is important that these conversations
are in fact thrown open in the recent 

1179
00:53:03,431 --> 00:53:04,264
history,
the political history of the United 

1180
00:53:05,500 --> 00:53:06,333
Kingdom.
We've seen the consequences of not 

1181
00:53:06,941 --> 00:53:11,050
having these conversations because when 
these debates were shut down by the,

1182
00:53:11,100 --> 00:53:11,450
the,
the,

1183
00:53:11,450 --> 00:53:15,520
the mainstream parties.
What happened as a result is the rise of

1184
00:53:15,820 --> 00:53:16,653
a two groups.
One is street protest movement and the 

1185
00:53:19,001 --> 00:53:19,834
other political party,
the Ukip United Kingdom Independence 

1186
00:53:23,680 --> 00:53:27,360
Party that wants to break away from the 
union and monster and all immigration.

1187
00:53:27,720 --> 00:53:28,710
That party,
which,

1188
00:53:28,770 --> 00:53:29,603
uh,
which started taking a chunk out of a 

1189
00:53:31,350 --> 00:53:35,670
conservative support base arose at 
lightening speed in the UK.

1190
00:53:35,671 --> 00:53:36,990
How do you,
by Nigel farage,

1191
00:53:37,170 --> 00:53:38,003
precisely because the main political 
parties didn't want to talk about 

1192
00:53:40,771 --> 00:53:41,604
racism.

1193
00:53:41,610 --> 00:53:42,390
And so,
uh,

1194
00:53:42,390 --> 00:53:43,223
uh,
an uglier version of that conversation 

1195
00:53:45,360 --> 00:53:48,630
happened on the outside,
on the fringes of the mainstream because

1196
00:53:48,631 --> 00:53:49,464
we didn't want to talk about it.
And the other thing that happened was 

1197
00:53:51,391 --> 00:53:53,490
the rise of the English Defense League,
the EDL.

1198
00:53:53,491 --> 00:53:54,270
So,
uh,

1199
00:53:54,270 --> 00:53:56,670
what have been Europe's largest street 
protest movement.

1200
00:53:57,140 --> 00:53:57,973
I began organizing rallies and 
demonstrations up and down the country 

1201
00:54:00,630 --> 00:54:03,750
because conversation about Islam,
Islam.

1202
00:54:04,560 --> 00:54:07,860
So what I advocate and the reason why 
I'm so a,

1203
00:54:07,870 --> 00:54:08,703
so a so heavily for having these 
conversations is we don't have them in 

1204
00:54:12,841 --> 00:54:14,940
the mainstream in a responsible way.
The fringes,

1205
00:54:14,941 --> 00:54:15,774
we'll have them in an irresponsible way.
And that's the danger of the voldemort 

1206
00:54:18,950 --> 00:54:19,783
effect that I refer to.
And that's very much what I'm trying to 

1207
00:54:21,631 --> 00:54:22,464
do with this show,
which is why I'm going to have people 

1208
00:54:24,121 --> 00:54:26,970
from all over the political spectrum 
here because we need,

1209
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:27,930
we need these conversations.

1210
00:54:27,930 --> 00:54:29,520
So just one more thing on the refugee 
thing.

1211
00:54:29,730 --> 00:54:30,563
What do you make of the Arab countries 
that basically aren't taking in their 

1212
00:54:34,711 --> 00:54:35,790
brothers?
I mean,

1213
00:54:35,791 --> 00:54:39,030
I think Saudi Arabia has led in maybe 30
families or something.

1214
00:54:39,090 --> 00:54:39,923
All these countries we're seeing Egypt's
not letting anyone in Turkey has done a 

1215
00:54:42,361 --> 00:54:43,194
lot.
Turkey's not in our country but all but 

1216
00:54:44,161 --> 00:54:45,630
all of these countries that are doing 
this.

1217
00:54:46,110 --> 00:54:48,000
What do you make of that?
So,

1218
00:54:48,001 --> 00:54:48,710
uh,
to,

1219
00:54:48,710 --> 00:54:49,543
to we have a caveat.
Here's the Gulf Arab countries that had 

1220
00:54:51,851 --> 00:54:55,860
let in zero refugees whereas Jordan,
Lebanon,

1221
00:54:56,190 --> 00:54:56,731
uh,
and,

1222
00:54:56,731 --> 00:54:57,564
and these surrounding countries that 
aren't Gulf Arabs have millions of 

1223
00:55:00,841 --> 00:55:01,674
refugees.
And so there is that distinction to be 

1224
00:55:03,031 --> 00:55:05,200
made.
Jordan is overflowing with refugee camps

1225
00:55:05,201 --> 00:55:08,220
and tents and so on.
But the Gulf Arabs,

1226
00:55:08,380 --> 00:55:08,941
uh,
you know,

1227
00:55:08,941 --> 00:55:10,740
the Emirates,
Saudi Arabia,

1228
00:55:10,770 --> 00:55:12,450
these countries,
Kuwait,

1229
00:55:12,660 --> 00:55:13,680
they,
uh,

1230
00:55:13,681 --> 00:55:14,431
they,
they,

1231
00:55:14,431 --> 00:55:17,820
they think that actually they think that
their responsibilities,

1232
00:55:17,821 --> 00:55:22,590
I've been met simply by providing funds 
to the refugee camps.

1233
00:55:22,950 --> 00:55:25,590
And I think that's a particularly 
interesting point there too,

1234
00:55:25,640 --> 00:55:27,670
to look at it as to the,
uh,

1235
00:55:27,810 --> 00:55:30,180
just with like,
just as with the Syria conflict,

1236
00:55:30,930 --> 00:55:31,763
there are certain responsibilities that 
the regional powers have to deal with 

1237
00:55:34,711 --> 00:55:37,410
conflict in their own back gardens and 
in their own region.

1238
00:55:37,830 --> 00:55:39,840
And unfortunately that hasn't been 
happening.

1239
00:55:40,320 --> 00:55:41,153
On the one hand,
we complain when the international 

1240
00:55:44,131 --> 00:55:44,964
community led by the United States of 
America intervenes and you're on the 

1241
00:55:48,451 --> 00:55:51,330
other hand when,
when no intervention is forthcoming,

1242
00:55:51,600 --> 00:55:52,433
we complain because we're saying that no
one cares about all the women and 

1243
00:55:54,781 --> 00:55:57,600
children,
innocent men who are dying.

1244
00:55:58,050 --> 00:56:00,690
And actually the only way around this is
to say,

1245
00:56:00,691 --> 00:56:01,524
okay,
if you don't want international 

1246
00:56:02,161 --> 00:56:02,994
intervention,
then take responsibility for your own 

1247
00:56:04,231 --> 00:56:06,630
region and uh,
and intervene yourselves.

1248
00:56:06,840 --> 00:56:07,673
And that applies to refugees and it 
applies to the war in Syria and dealing 

1249
00:56:10,561 --> 00:56:13,380
with that through political and 
diplomatic and military needs.

1250
00:56:13,620 --> 00:56:14,161
And I,
I'm,

1251
00:56:14,161 --> 00:56:15,330
you know,
I'm very critical.

1252
00:56:15,331 --> 00:56:16,164
Unfortunately I don't think these Gulf 
countries have been doing even nearly 

1253
00:56:18,901 --> 00:56:20,490
enough regard.
And by the way,

1254
00:56:20,491 --> 00:56:21,324
I don't want to just blame the Gulf 
countries or any of the Arab states 

1255
00:56:23,501 --> 00:56:23,980
because we

1256
00:56:23,980 --> 00:56:26,560
just saw at the UN in these last couple 
of days,

1257
00:56:26,561 --> 00:56:27,394
there seems to be now be this new 
alliance between Iraq and Iran and 

1258
00:56:30,251 --> 00:56:31,450
Russia.
And again,

1259
00:56:31,451 --> 00:56:33,760
as to what you just said,
the more the US pulls out,

1260
00:56:33,761 --> 00:56:35,980
it seems as though the worse it gets.
And every time we go in,

1261
00:56:36,250 --> 00:56:37,260
we seem to make it worse,
so,

1262
00:56:37,360 --> 00:56:39,430
so there are no easy answers here I 
think is the,

1263
00:56:39,520 --> 00:56:41,300
is the ultimate conclusion.
Um,

1264
00:56:41,340 --> 00:56:42,173
so I,
I have one more thing for you because 

1265
00:56:43,241 --> 00:56:44,860
I've been trying to end all my 
interviews on,

1266
00:56:44,890 --> 00:56:45,723
on some sort of feeling of hope and 
actually you've done a nice job of 

1267
00:56:48,551 --> 00:56:50,410
giving us some hope that this whole way 
through.

1268
00:56:50,800 --> 00:56:51,633
But I really sensed that there has been 
over the last couple of months a real 

1269
00:56:56,171 --> 00:56:58,600
secular awakening.
I sense it in,

1270
00:56:58,601 --> 00:57:00,760
in the response I'm getting to the 
videos,

1271
00:57:01,030 --> 00:57:03,130
the facebook messages.
People are sending me emails,

1272
00:57:03,131 --> 00:57:05,530
the tweets,
the whole thing that people that secular

1273
00:57:05,531 --> 00:57:10,531
people that want to base their values on
humanism and not on,

1274
00:57:11,050 --> 00:57:11,883
you know,
magical sky gods and all of that stuff 

1275
00:57:13,541 --> 00:57:15,620
that they're really waking up.
And I,

1276
00:57:15,621 --> 00:57:17,440
I think you've had a part to do with it.
I think Sam,

1277
00:57:17,441 --> 00:57:19,810
I think many other people do you sense 
that too?

1278
00:57:19,840 --> 00:57:21,850
Please tell me you do or I'm in a lot of
trouble.

1279
00:57:22,710 --> 00:57:23,543
I said it's particularly that more 
voices that I call them minorities 

1280
00:57:27,941 --> 00:57:28,774
within the minority,
people on the left that we've spoken 

1281
00:57:30,791 --> 00:57:33,070
about earlier.
They traditional care about the minority

1282
00:57:33,071 --> 00:57:33,904
communities,
but actually I'd say to them that if 

1283
00:57:35,291 --> 00:57:37,780
they really worth their salt,
if they really want to test their metal,

1284
00:57:38,110 --> 00:57:38,943
what they should be caring about.
Other minorities within those minority 

1285
00:57:41,351 --> 00:57:42,760
communities,
the gay Muslims,

1286
00:57:42,970 --> 00:57:44,650
the lesbian Muslims,
the Muslims,

1287
00:57:44,651 --> 00:57:45,291
the,
the,

1288
00:57:45,291 --> 00:57:49,360
the liberal Muslim,
a Muslims and the minorities such as the

1289
00:57:49,361 --> 00:57:50,194
Christians in Egypt of the CDS in Iraq.
So those minorities within minority 

1290
00:57:54,821 --> 00:57:57,190
communities.
I since have been rallying and waking up

1291
00:57:57,191 --> 00:57:58,024
and galvanizing.
I think I sense more and more Muslim 

1292
00:58:01,181 --> 00:58:03,700
voices coming out to speak against not 
just Islam,

1293
00:58:03,710 --> 00:58:04,543
Islam from also a Islamic religious 
conservatism and we get messages every 

1294
00:58:09,040 --> 00:58:09,873
single day.
We get people asking to join our 

1295
00:58:10,421 --> 00:58:11,254
organization to help us to work with us.
And I think that's really fantastic 

1296
00:58:14,951 --> 00:58:19,840
because if we're going to really defeat 
at the scourge of theocratic fascism and

1297
00:58:19,841 --> 00:58:23,740
if we're going to help reform the way in
which Islam is interpreted the today and

1298
00:58:23,741 --> 00:58:26,440
those voices are really the crucial 
voices that we need to hear from.

1299
00:58:26,700 --> 00:58:28,650
Yeah.
Well you've been a huge part of that.

1300
00:58:28,651 --> 00:58:31,650
So I thank you for taking some time off 
while you're in New York.

1301
00:58:31,680 --> 00:58:32,513
Your book with Sam,
Islam in the future of tolerance is 

1302
00:58:33,841 --> 00:58:34,674
already sold out.
The preorders are already sold out on 

1303
00:58:36,061 --> 00:58:37,490
Amazon.
It's coming out way.

1304
00:58:37,500 --> 00:58:38,820
It's coming out in a couple of days in 
the bookstores,

1305
00:58:38,821 --> 00:58:39,060
right?

1306
00:58:39,060 --> 00:58:40,710
Yeah.
It will hit the bookstores very soon and

1307
00:58:40,711 --> 00:58:41,544
then everyone will be able to get a copy
and then actually after that the kindle 

1308
00:58:43,951 --> 00:58:46,800
version will come out to a.
There is a kindle version coming out,

1309
00:58:46,801 --> 00:58:49,200
but it will come out after the pets.
A hardback version.

1310
00:58:49,201 --> 00:58:50,000
Here's the bookshelves.

1311
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:50,551
All right,
well I'm,

1312
00:58:50,551 --> 00:58:52,630
I'm really glad that we got a chance to 
do this.

1313
00:58:52,631 --> 00:58:54,420
Almost face to face.
We can see each other but.

1314
00:58:54,520 --> 00:58:56,350
But one day we'll be able to have a 
beer.

1315
00:58:56,351 --> 00:58:59,380
And do it for real and good luck with 
all your work.

1316
00:58:59,381 --> 00:59:00,214
Appreciate it.
Thank you.
