1
00:00:04,550 --> 00:00:07,490
Joining me today is the founder for act 
for America,

2
00:00:07,491 --> 00:00:12,491
a New York Times bestselling author and 
author of the new book rise in Defensive

3
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:16,040
Judeo Christian values and freedom.
Bridgette Gabriel,

4
00:00:16,130 --> 00:00:17,420
welcome back to the Rubin report.

5
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:19,990
Thank you dave.
I'm delighted to be back with you.

6
00:00:20,070 --> 00:00:21,810
I am delighted that you're here.
First off,

7
00:00:21,811 --> 00:00:24,150
before we do anything else,
I was gonna wear the exact same shirt.

8
00:00:26,050 --> 00:00:26,500
That's a.

9
00:00:27,790 --> 00:00:30,520
That is a girly girly shirt.
I love what's going on here.

10
00:00:30,521 --> 00:00:33,520
Okay,
so I had you on about maybe a year and a

11
00:00:33,521 --> 00:00:38,521
half ago or so.
You were the only person in the history 

12
00:00:38,521 --> 00:00:42,421
of the Rubin report that you caused the 
tear to to formulate in my.

13
00:00:43,241 --> 00:00:45,400
I think you know exactly when it 
happened.

14
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:50,440
Yeah,
so before I even let you say anything 

15
00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:50,440
we're throwing to the clip.

16
00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:53,920
We only take care of freedom and 
preserve it to the next generation,

17
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:59,280
and I am doing my part as an American,
as a brave American and the home of the 

18
00:01:00,731 --> 00:01:05,731
brave to make sure I follow in the 
footsteps of our founding fathers and do

19
00:01:06,191 --> 00:01:10,960
my part as they entrusted me with that 
which they have created.

20
00:01:10,961 --> 00:01:14,290
I feel it is my duty to make sure to 
preserve it,

21
00:01:14,291 --> 00:01:19,291
to pass it to my children and their 
American children and many generations 

22
00:01:19,291 --> 00:01:20,320
to come.
That's why we fight.

23
00:01:20,890 --> 00:01:23,590
And I am so fortunate that through this 
fight,

24
00:01:23,790 --> 00:01:26,590
and it is a fight for freedom,
for liberty,

25
00:01:26,591 --> 00:01:28,120
for democracy,
for security,

26
00:01:28,390 --> 00:01:33,070
for human rights.
I am privileged to meet the most amazing

27
00:01:33,071 --> 00:01:35,110
people that I would never otherwise 
meet,

28
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:38,260
like sitting here with you today.
Uh,

29
00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:41,230
and meet friends that have become 
lifelong friends,

30
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:46,320
literally like family to me that I would
never have otherwise met if it wasn't 

31
00:01:46,721 --> 00:01:47,500
doing for what I do.

32
00:01:47,770 --> 00:01:52,770
So do I get depressed doing what I do?
Talking about terrorism and national 

33
00:01:52,770 --> 00:01:52,810
security?
Of course I do.

34
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:54,280
I'm human,
like everybody.

35
00:01:54,730 --> 00:01:59,730
Sometimes I cry.
Sometimes I'm completely depressed over 

36
00:01:59,730 --> 00:02:03,271
things that are happening.
Sometimes I hurt deeply by people who 

37
00:02:03,271 --> 00:02:06,421
stabbed me in the back or say bad things
about me or even reading my wikipedia 

38
00:02:06,421 --> 00:02:09,601
profile.
But what keeps me so energized is the 

39
00:02:09,601 --> 00:02:12,550
American people and the American spirit 
knowing that we are making a difference.

40
00:02:12,551 --> 00:02:14,800
We are growing,
we are changing our country,

41
00:02:14,980 --> 00:02:17,230
we are fighting,
we have a purpose.

42
00:02:17,290 --> 00:02:21,010
So when you and I die on our deathbed,
we can look back and we can say,

43
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:26,440
I made a difference as we take our last 
breath and that's enough for me.

44
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:30,130
That is how you end an interview.
I mean that's it right there.

45
00:02:30,131 --> 00:02:32,530
That was,
that was like your opus right there.

46
00:02:32,870 --> 00:02:37,870
Well,
because I spoke from the heart and when 

47
00:02:37,870 --> 00:02:40,991
you speak from the heart,
your message resonates with people and 

48
00:02:40,991 --> 00:02:44,831
this is exactly why people,
a you and me are having such traction 

49
00:02:44,831 --> 00:02:48,821
with.
A lot of people are saying we love what 

50
00:02:48,821 --> 00:02:51,761
you're saying.
It's about time that somebody will say 

51
00:02:51,761 --> 00:02:54,491
the things that you are saying,
our message is resonating and you know 

52
00:02:54,491 --> 00:02:55,970
why people want something genuine and 
they can tell,

53
00:02:55,971 --> 00:03:00,971
you know,
I always tell my children the one thing 

54
00:03:00,971 --> 00:03:03,341
you can never love,
you can never fight club because people 

55
00:03:03,341 --> 00:03:07,231
can tell when you're genuine and in a 
world that we live in today where 

56
00:03:07,231 --> 00:03:09,130
everything is fake,
everything is about social media and how

57
00:03:09,131 --> 00:03:11,130
things appear before the camera and,
and,

58
00:03:11,180 --> 00:03:16,180
and what's in it for me and I'm going to
be your friend because I'm going to get 

59
00:03:16,180 --> 00:03:19,171
something out of it.
When people look you and I put our life 

60
00:03:19,171 --> 00:03:21,820
on the line because of the conviction 
that we have about the truth that we are

61
00:03:21,821 --> 00:03:26,821
speaking and why we are willing to go to
great extent to just fight for that 

62
00:03:27,131 --> 00:03:29,170
truth.
It resonates with people.

63
00:03:29,350 --> 00:03:32,730
So I go to wait to be with you today.
This is great.

64
00:03:32,740 --> 00:03:33,460
Why don't team

65
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:37,590
did you always have this kind of 
passion?

66
00:03:37,591 --> 00:03:39,600
I mean,
when you were on last time we told her,

67
00:03:39,601 --> 00:03:44,601
you told your whole life story,
which is absolutely fascinating and if 

68
00:03:44,601 --> 00:03:47,931
you want to give me a just like a two 
minute recap and we'll link to it down 

69
00:03:47,931 --> 00:03:47,940
below so people can watch the whole 
thing if they haven't.

70
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:49,740
So if you wanna give me a little recap 
on that,

71
00:03:49,950 --> 00:03:52,080
but I also want to know where your,
that,

72
00:03:52,290 --> 00:03:53,790
that smile,
that joy,

73
00:03:53,791 --> 00:03:56,370
that presence,
where does that come from within you and

74
00:03:56,371 --> 00:03:57,360
did you always have that?

75
00:03:57,900 --> 00:04:02,900
I love life and I am so passionate about
life is because I lived from the age of 

76
00:04:05,581 --> 00:04:09,420
10 till the age of 20,
waiting to die every single day.

77
00:04:09,660 --> 00:04:14,660
So every single day in my formula,
two years when I opened my eyes and I 

78
00:04:15,031 --> 00:04:20,031
saw sunshine outside,
I didn't know if I'm gonna live to see 

79
00:04:20,031 --> 00:04:22,440
the sunset.
So living in a bomb shelter,

80
00:04:22,470 --> 00:04:27,470
you know,
people ask me where the specimen comes 

81
00:04:27,470 --> 00:04:29,181
from.
My nine slash 11 happened to me in 1975 

82
00:04:29,181 --> 00:04:30,570
when radical Islam is to blow up my 
home,

83
00:04:30,630 --> 00:04:33,000
bringing it down,
bring me under the rubble,

84
00:04:33,001 --> 00:04:38,001
wounded.
I ended up in a hospital for two and a 

85
00:04:38,001 --> 00:04:38,550
half months and later when I came back 
home,

86
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:43,020
my home was no longer the home I left.
I ended up living in this bomb shelter,

87
00:04:43,021 --> 00:04:46,200
eight by 10 room underground,
no electricity,

88
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:48,450
no water,
and very little food.

89
00:04:48,660 --> 00:04:51,840
And that's where I lived for seven years
of my life,

90
00:04:52,050 --> 00:04:55,380
robbed of my youth,
barely interacting with people,

91
00:04:55,500 --> 00:05:00,500
barely interacting with people my age.
I lived with my parents who were an 

92
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:02,550
elderly couple and that bomb shelter.
So all this,

93
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:03,500
uh,
uh,

94
00:05:03,530 --> 00:05:06,810
cooped up passion.
Now I tell people I'm making up for lost

95
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:09,210
time.
So I love life.

96
00:05:09,211 --> 00:05:13,950
I am so grateful for life.
I'm so grateful for the people I meet,

97
00:05:14,190 --> 00:05:19,190
the places I go.
I never thought I'd live the day beyond 

98
00:05:19,190 --> 00:05:22,101
20.
And then I never thought I'd live with 

99
00:05:22,101 --> 00:05:22,230
day beyond 30.
And he's loving life.

100
00:05:22,231 --> 00:05:26,470
I just started 54 years old.
I'm so proud to make it someone.

101
00:05:26,700 --> 00:05:27,570
Thank you.
Thank you.

102
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:30,150
When,
when you have survived,

103
00:05:30,151 --> 00:05:33,660
as long as I have survived,
you brag about.

104
00:05:33,780 --> 00:05:38,160
I made it to this day at this age.
So this is why I love life,

105
00:05:38,270 --> 00:05:43,270
so we're going to link to your original 
sit down and your whole story about 

106
00:05:43,270 --> 00:05:47,141
growing up in Lebanon and all that so 
people can watch out if they haven't 

107
00:05:47,141 --> 00:05:47,141
seen it.
Um,

108
00:05:47,141 --> 00:05:50,950
but not everybody likes you.
And I remember before I had you on the 

109
00:05:50,950 --> 00:05:51,330
first time,
uh,

110
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:56,360
you know,
when people google you and you even 

111
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:56,360
referenced this in,
in that clip we are talking about,

112
00:05:56,360 --> 00:06:00,281
you know,
if you check your wikipedia saying 

113
00:06:00,281 --> 00:06:00,281
people say all sorts of awful things 
about you and all this,

114
00:06:00,281 --> 00:06:00,560
and I was a little worried.
I was like,

115
00:06:00,561 --> 00:06:02,900
ah,
it's like I'm going to have bridgette on

116
00:06:02,901 --> 00:06:05,090
and I'm going to get hate for it.
And all that.

117
00:06:05,091 --> 00:06:10,091
Now I'm really past that part of life.
Now I just want to do what I think is 

118
00:06:10,091 --> 00:06:13,211
right and I want to sit down with,
with people like you and have those 

119
00:06:13,211 --> 00:06:13,211
conversations.
Um,

120
00:06:13,211 --> 00:06:17,680
but are you shocked at the kind of 
pushback you get for defending the west 

121
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:19,220
and defending Judeo Christian values?

122
00:06:20,820 --> 00:06:23,130
I am no longer shocked.
I was in the beginning.

123
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:25,590
I was very hurt,
very disappointed.

124
00:06:25,890 --> 00:06:30,890
I thought my message,
of course the west is going to resonate.

125
00:06:31,351 --> 00:06:36,351
It's going to resonate in the west.
People are going to appreciate why it's 

126
00:06:36,351 --> 00:06:36,720
important to fight for freedom of 
speech.

127
00:06:37,050 --> 00:06:42,050
I was born and raised in Lebanon in a 
country where if you stand up against 

128
00:06:42,050 --> 00:06:42,840
the status quo and you speak against the
regime,

129
00:06:43,230 --> 00:06:48,230
you are killed.
They come take you in the middle of the 

130
00:06:48,230 --> 00:06:48,230
night,
killed you.

131
00:06:48,230 --> 00:06:48,540
You will disappear.
You'll never hear from you again.

132
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:51,180
I still have friends who disappeared 30 
years ago.

133
00:06:51,181 --> 00:06:53,310
Their parents don't even know if they 
are alive or dead.

134
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:57,600
Journalist and my country of birth in 
Lebanon get killed for writing the wrong

135
00:06:57,601 --> 00:07:02,601
thing.
So when I came to the West and when I 

136
00:07:02,601 --> 00:07:04,761
started speaking in defense of our 
freedoms and our values and our way of 

137
00:07:04,761 --> 00:07:07,320
life and the American values of,
of,

138
00:07:07,660 --> 00:07:12,660
you know,
standing up for the truth and speaking 

139
00:07:12,660 --> 00:07:13,590
the truth without having to be worried 
about somebody killing you,

140
00:07:14,070 --> 00:07:17,670
I could not believe people will,
will come against me like that.

141
00:07:17,940 --> 00:07:21,030
But you know what?
If you don't stand for something,

142
00:07:21,470 --> 00:07:22,490
yeah,
you know

143
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:26,400
you have to stand up for what you 
believe.

144
00:07:26,850 --> 00:07:31,850
Those are the people that make a 
difference and usually people that make 

145
00:07:31,850 --> 00:07:31,850
a difference in this world are not 
popular.

146
00:07:31,850 --> 00:07:33,570
The most hated people in the.
We'll look at Churchill.

147
00:07:34,110 --> 00:07:34,640
I mean,
you know,

148
00:07:34,650 --> 00:07:36,030
when he was alive,
you know,

149
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:37,470
people hated him.
They thought,

150
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:38,730
oh my gosh,
you know,

151
00:07:38,970 --> 00:07:43,970
look at them today.
People call people call people that has 

152
00:07:43,970 --> 00:07:45,170
spoken such words of wisdom,
but people left at the Monday.

153
00:07:45,180 --> 00:07:47,610
We're saying them.
And so here we are today.

154
00:07:47,611 --> 00:07:52,611
We stand up and we fight.
And it doesn't matter what people say 

155
00:07:52,611 --> 00:07:55,581
about me,
I do it what I believe is right because 

156
00:07:55,581 --> 00:07:56,880
I believe we are on a mission to save 
Western civilization,

157
00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:00,750
which is under attack right now.
And I'm wanting to do my part to make it

158
00:08:00,751 --> 00:08:01,170
happen

159
00:08:01,290 --> 00:08:06,290
is part of the problem of the West now 
is that we don't have enough stories 

160
00:08:07,261 --> 00:08:11,010
like yours because we've had it pretty 
good in the West for the last,

161
00:08:11,190 --> 00:08:12,480
you know,
50 some odd years.

162
00:08:12,481 --> 00:08:14,460
Certainly in the United States.
We've had a pretty good here,

163
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:17,670
so we've sort of gotten fat and lazy on 
freedom.

164
00:08:17,671 --> 00:08:22,671
We don't know what we're fighting for.
We don't know what are the generations 

165
00:08:22,671 --> 00:08:23,970
before us lived through.
You lived through something,

166
00:08:23,971 --> 00:08:27,150
so then you come here and then you see 
all these people that are slowly eroding

167
00:08:27,151 --> 00:08:28,560
their freedoms and you're like,
Whoa,

168
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:31,200
I know what this.
Where this leads.

169
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:35,040
Exactly.
My past is America's future.

170
00:08:35,220 --> 00:08:38,580
Unless America wakes up today,
see I am the end.

171
00:08:38,581 --> 00:08:43,581
Frank who lived to tell about it.
Can you imagine if Anne Frank was alive 

172
00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:48,920
and the Nazis were spreading worldwide 
and she just escaped the concentration 

173
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:53,331
camps and she came to the United States 
and not csm was started rising in the 

174
00:08:53,331 --> 00:08:57,440
United States.
She would be saying the same words that 

175
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:58,770
you when she was alive and well.
In my case.

176
00:08:58,771 --> 00:09:01,830
I started speaking after the attacks on 
nine slash 11 on the United States.

177
00:09:01,831 --> 00:09:06,831
I started speaking about the threat of 
radical Islam to world peace in our 

178
00:09:06,831 --> 00:09:08,700
national security,
but because Americans had it so easy,

179
00:09:08,701 --> 00:09:11,490
they cannot fathom that some people 
could hate us so much.

180
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:16,700
Even though radical Islamic terrorists 
hijacked airplanes and use them as a 

181
00:09:17,101 --> 00:09:22,101
human missiles,
flying them into skyscrapers with the 

182
00:09:22,101 --> 00:09:24,660
intention of killing not 3000,
but maybe 50,000

183
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:26,160
that worked in that building,
you know,

184
00:09:26,161 --> 00:09:29,880
if they were late only 15 minutes,
they would have killed tens of thousands

185
00:09:29,881 --> 00:09:30,660
of Americans.

186
00:09:30,900 --> 00:09:33,330
Um,
and so this is what I was talking about,

187
00:09:33,540 --> 00:09:38,540
but Americans are such good people.
People who have never experienced the 

188
00:09:38,540 --> 00:09:43,101
type of terrorism that I lived under 
cannot relate and think that somebody 

189
00:09:43,111 --> 00:09:48,111
could be that bad,
that actually that's the real intention 

190
00:09:48,111 --> 00:09:50,250
to kill as many people as possible.
How do you wake people up to that then?

191
00:09:50,310 --> 00:09:55,310
Because it's a really hard.
Because not everyone can have the lived 

192
00:09:55,310 --> 00:09:58,041
experience that you've had.
You don't have to wake all the people 

193
00:09:58,041 --> 00:10:00,570
up.
You just have to wake some of the people

194
00:10:00,571 --> 00:10:05,571
up.
You just have to wake up the passionate 

195
00:10:05,571 --> 00:10:05,571
I,
you know,

196
00:10:05,571 --> 00:10:06,900
and my book rise,
I say two percent of the passionate will

197
00:10:06,901 --> 00:10:11,901
always rule the 98 percent in different 
and doesn't take money to change the 

198
00:10:11,901 --> 00:10:16,461
world.
Don't percent of the passionate will 

199
00:10:16,461 --> 00:10:19,011
always rule the 98 percent in different.
You just need to get people who are 

200
00:10:19,011 --> 00:10:19,350
fired up for your cause.

201
00:10:19,470 --> 00:10:24,470
You need to get people who actually 
understand the problem and get the 

202
00:10:24,470 --> 00:10:25,230
problem and want to do something to 
change the world.

203
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:27,690
Those are the people you need to rally 
around you.

204
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:31,140
Those are the people who are gonna make 
a difference in this world and those are

205
00:10:31,141 --> 00:10:33,240
the people that I,
that I try to communicate with.

206
00:10:33,390 --> 00:10:36,420
And because of that I was able to build 
an organization,

207
00:10:36,450 --> 00:10:41,450
act for America.
I'm proud to tell you that we are now 

208
00:10:41,450 --> 00:10:44,100
over 1 million members and it's 
incredible.

209
00:10:44,250 --> 00:10:47,460
We have chapters nationwide.
We have passed bills,

210
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:52,440
$100 bills on the federal level as well 
as the state level to protect America.

211
00:10:52,710 --> 00:10:55,320
So when people tell me,
don't you worry about the names.

212
00:10:55,321 --> 00:10:56,730
I mean people call you names,
you know,

213
00:10:56,780 --> 00:10:57,180
they,
they,

214
00:10:57,230 --> 00:10:57,800
they,
they,

215
00:10:57,801 --> 00:10:59,370
they,
they will make you look bad.

216
00:10:59,371 --> 00:11:04,371
They were on the list.
The SLPC SPLC has called me and white 

217
00:11:04,371 --> 00:11:04,890
supremacy.

218
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:10,350
How do you like those white supremacists
clips and the white supremacists skin?

219
00:11:10,590 --> 00:11:13,650
And this white supremacist hair,
um,

220
00:11:13,710 --> 00:11:17,100
but I tell people when people slap 
labels on you,

221
00:11:17,101 --> 00:11:19,260
it's because they cannot argue with your
facts.

222
00:11:19,530 --> 00:11:22,080
That's why the only thing they can do is
call you names.

223
00:11:22,230 --> 00:11:25,080
They cannot debate you on the facts.
And you know,

224
00:11:25,130 --> 00:11:26,400
I,
I tell people all the time,

225
00:11:26,460 --> 00:11:31,460
don't worry about the labels and don't 
worry about the haters than New York 

226
00:11:31,460 --> 00:11:32,010
Times.
And my last book,

227
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:37,100
they must be stopped.
The book came out in September of 2008 

228
00:11:37,100 --> 00:11:41,060
that York Times interviewed me and they 
couldn't find one quote and my article.

229
00:11:42,031 --> 00:11:47,031
So what did they do?
They titled the Article Radical 

230
00:11:47,031 --> 00:11:47,610
Islamophobe,
not just an Islamophobe.

231
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:51,900
I am a radical Islamophobe.
Can you imagine if I would have let that

232
00:11:51,901 --> 00:11:55,300
stop me because I was hurt that somebody
didn't like me.

233
00:11:55,301 --> 00:11:59,110
And that will be a radical Islamophobia 
instead of hiding under a table.

234
00:11:59,260 --> 00:12:01,930
You know,
trying to kind of pat my emotions.

235
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:07,200
I went there and continue doing exactly 
what I do best since 2008 till today.

236
00:12:08,110 --> 00:12:11,410
My organization has helped pass $100 
bills.

237
00:12:11,650 --> 00:12:16,650
And that's why I tell people,
don't let the naysayers and those to 

238
00:12:16,650 --> 00:12:16,650
slap labels on you,
stop you,

239
00:12:16,650 --> 00:12:17,560
keep on moving forward.

240
00:12:17,730 --> 00:12:20,490
What do you make of these leftist 
organizations,

241
00:12:20,491 --> 00:12:24,570
whether it's SPLC or the ato or now in 
the media,

242
00:12:24,571 --> 00:12:29,571
the New York Times that are actually 
empowering the very ideologies that 

243
00:12:30,181 --> 00:12:32,520
would love to take away all of their 
freedoms.

244
00:12:32,521 --> 00:12:33,420
And in this way,
I mean it's,

245
00:12:33,421 --> 00:12:38,421
you've got this sort of,
you've got the progressive's basically 

246
00:12:38,421 --> 00:12:40,320
in bed with the Islamists and to me it's
like they're just sort of willful idiots

247
00:12:40,321 --> 00:12:42,410
or there's probably some other 
pejorative.

248
00:12:43,030 --> 00:12:43,910
Exactly.
You know,

249
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:48,920
and my book cries,
I have a whole chapter titled the 

250
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:51,471
leftists Islamists Coalition Because 
that's exactly what we are seeing right 

251
00:12:51,471 --> 00:12:51,900
now.
Coming together.

252
00:12:51,901 --> 00:12:56,901
The enemy of my enemy is my friend.
So we are seeing two people that do not 

253
00:12:56,901 --> 00:13:00,981
agree with anything that we say,
do not believe in American 

254
00:13:00,981 --> 00:13:05,300
exceptionalism.
Do not believe that America shouldn't 

255
00:13:05,300 --> 00:13:05,730
have strong borders.
Do not believe that we know that we need

256
00:13:05,731 --> 00:13:07,580
to have a national identity.
We need to.

257
00:13:07,740 --> 00:13:09,120
I mean,
securing our border,

258
00:13:09,121 --> 00:13:12,000
meaning securing and protecting our 
national identity.

259
00:13:12,300 --> 00:13:14,610
They did not believe in borders.
They do not believe in language.

260
00:13:14,611 --> 00:13:17,460
They want to bring America down to the 
parts of the rest of the world.

261
00:13:17,461 --> 00:13:19,350
You know,
America is equaled was Venezuela.

262
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:24,300
No one is better than anybody.
All societies are created equal uni that

263
00:13:24,450 --> 00:13:27,960
even though people are created equal in 
the eyes of God,

264
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:33,200
societies are not created equal.
And so what we are seeing right now is 

265
00:13:33,571 --> 00:13:35,790
leftist organizations working with the 
Islamic.

266
00:13:35,791 --> 00:13:38,330
So you've got organizations like the 
Hclu,

267
00:13:38,370 --> 00:13:43,370
the southern poverty law center,
planned parenthood a move on that or 

268
00:13:43,370 --> 00:13:47,220
working with people like Linda Sarsour 
who is a devout Islamist,

269
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:52,440
a proponent of Sharia law and working 
with people like her or with care 

270
00:13:52,570 --> 00:13:57,570
counsel on American Islamic Relations.
The acl is basically the legal arm of 

271
00:13:57,780 --> 00:13:59,370
the council on American Islamic 
Relations.

272
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:01,930
So do you think they realize what's 
going on here?

273
00:14:01,931 --> 00:14:06,931
This is the part that I'm always sort of
because I don't like impugning people's 

274
00:14:06,931 --> 00:14:06,931
motives.
Right?

275
00:14:06,931 --> 00:14:11,850
So it's like,
do they realize that they're working 

276
00:14:11,850 --> 00:14:14,530
with people who once they have the power
will gladly cut them out?

277
00:14:14,890 --> 00:14:15,690
No,
they don't.

278
00:14:15,810 --> 00:14:16,860
They just don't.
They don't.

279
00:14:17,070 --> 00:14:22,070
Because people that work for the ACL,
you people that work for a,

280
00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:26,640
a different leftist organizations have 
good hearts,

281
00:14:26,910 --> 00:14:31,910
they love America and they cannot 
believe that people couldn't be bad or 

282
00:14:31,910 --> 00:14:34,050
people couldn't use them for their end 
goal.

283
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:36,210
You know,
when I talk about the Muslim Brotherhood

284
00:14:36,211 --> 00:14:41,211
project and you and I have talked about 
the Muslim Brotherhood project and our 

285
00:14:41,211 --> 00:14:43,761
previous interview,
people need to go watch that interview 

286
00:14:43,761 --> 00:14:45,120
with me.
Everybody watching us right now,

287
00:14:45,121 --> 00:14:47,040
they need to go back and watch that 
previous interview.

288
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:52,400
Um,
the Muslim Brotherhood wrote a plan and 

289
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:55,131
100 year plan for radical Islam to 
infiltrate and dominate the west and 

290
00:14:55,131 --> 00:14:56,120
established a stomach government on 
earth.

291
00:14:56,600 --> 00:15:01,600
What makes the plan so unique,
especially the plan for the United 

292
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:01,610
States,
for the destruction of America.

293
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:06,880
The last page of the plan for America,
let's 29 front Islamic organizations set

294
00:15:07,751 --> 00:15:12,751
up in the United States with the 
specific purpose of sabotage in America 

295
00:15:12,751 --> 00:15:13,040
and destroying it from within.

296
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:15,500
Many of these organizations that I 
mentioned,

297
00:15:15,501 --> 00:15:17,570
Isna,
Islamic Society of North America,

298
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:20,900
the MSA Muslim Students Association 
care,

299
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:26,080
which started as iap.
Islamic Association for Palestine later 

300
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:30,731
became care because they wanted to 
create another name because the FBI was 

301
00:15:30,731 --> 00:15:32,750
on their tail knowing that they are a 
Hamas in the United States.

302
00:15:33,140 --> 00:15:37,070
Those are the names mentioned.
So what we're seeing right now is people

303
00:15:37,071 --> 00:15:42,071
like the Hclu move on.org.
The southern poverty law center are 

304
00:15:42,071 --> 00:15:45,590
basically used as the useful idiots at 
the hands of an Islamist with an agenda.

305
00:15:45,890 --> 00:15:50,890
So while I am very upset at how the Adl 
or the SPLC or the acl EU is taking the 

306
00:15:55,311 --> 00:15:58,280
side of Islam as the against people like
me,

307
00:15:58,281 --> 00:16:00,950
I'm not sure what they say about you,
but I know they hate my guts.

308
00:16:02,310 --> 00:16:07,310
Yeah.
And so I see that and it's sad to 

309
00:16:07,310 --> 00:16:11,651
realize that their good intentions are 
being used to do something better at the

310
00:16:12,950 --> 00:16:14,900
end,
but they don't realize it at this point.

311
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:20,080
Meanwhile,
they're working with the Islam is 

312
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:22,750
against people like me who basically are
trying to warn against the same people 

313
00:16:22,750 --> 00:16:23,900
are going to destroy them at the end and
that's why

314
00:16:24,190 --> 00:16:29,190
the question that way because I don't 
like attacking people's motives and I 

315
00:16:29,190 --> 00:16:30,460
believed that if we were to sit down 
with all of the people at the Acl,

316
00:16:30,461 --> 00:16:35,461
you,
that the vast majority of them are 

317
00:16:35,461 --> 00:16:38,820
totally doing all of these things for 
what they believe to be the the right 

318
00:16:38,820 --> 00:16:42,211
reasons,
and yet they've been just sort of 

319
00:16:42,211 --> 00:16:42,670
tricked into having some really unholy 
alliance.

320
00:16:42,940 --> 00:16:44,700
Look,
the southern poverty law center,

321
00:16:44,900 --> 00:16:45,960
uh,
the same thing.

322
00:16:45,990 --> 00:16:50,990
They started as a good organization 
fighting the Klu Klux Klan doing 

323
00:16:50,990 --> 00:16:52,260
something good that was a result of 
that.

324
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:57,440
They raised money.
They found the Ku Klux Klan and the 

325
00:16:57,440 --> 00:17:01,410
client deserves to be in a whole because
we in America will never ever tolerate 

326
00:17:01,410 --> 00:17:05,720
such true hatred.
But for them right now to slap the 

327
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:10,281
label,
hate on anybody speaks the truth or do 

328
00:17:10,281 --> 00:17:13,490
not agree with their point of view.
What my heart is the.

329
00:17:13,530 --> 00:17:15,900
I never judge anybody's heart.
I am the same way.

330
00:17:16,140 --> 00:17:21,140
You never know.
People would ask me about a Barack 

331
00:17:21,140 --> 00:17:21,140
Obama.
Do you think he's a Muslim?

332
00:17:21,140 --> 00:17:24,050
You know I cannot judge anybody's heart.
I don't know who he prays for.

333
00:17:24,090 --> 00:17:27,130
I didn't know what's between him and his
God is God.

334
00:17:27,390 --> 00:17:32,390
That's what he does and the privacy of 
his own home and I will never judge 

335
00:17:32,390 --> 00:17:32,700
where he stands and a lot of people on 
the right,

336
00:17:32,730 --> 00:17:34,680
they didn't even like me saying those 
words,

337
00:17:35,100 --> 00:17:40,100
but that's the truth.
I will never judge what's in somebody's 

338
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:41,670
heart or what's in somebody's mind.
I judged them by their actions.

339
00:17:41,790 --> 00:17:44,340
So now when people slept labels on me,
oh,

340
00:17:44,341 --> 00:17:46,950
she's a hater.
You don't even know me.

341
00:17:47,070 --> 00:17:49,410
You have never even sat down with me and
talked me.

342
00:17:49,530 --> 00:17:54,530
How can you slap a label and emotional 
label on somebody that you don't even 

343
00:17:54,530 --> 00:17:54,530
know

344
00:17:54,530 --> 00:17:58,440
if you're a hater,
you're seriously much better actress 

345
00:17:58,440 --> 00:17:58,480
than hater because you got me fooled,
lady.

346
00:17:58,700 --> 00:17:59,840
I.
I'm telling you.

347
00:17:59,841 --> 00:18:00,340
I mean,
you know,

348
00:18:01,190 --> 00:18:06,190
sad to see that coming from them and 
they're not listening to whatever 

349
00:18:06,190 --> 00:18:08,420
explanation or even when we reach out to
them,

350
00:18:08,450 --> 00:18:10,690
they don't want to talk to us.
They don't want to hear our side of the,

351
00:18:10,730 --> 00:18:15,130
of the view is like they judged us in 
antia and that is that,

352
00:18:15,450 --> 00:18:17,280
you know,
speaking of judging and obscenity,

353
00:18:17,281 --> 00:18:19,670
yet they are no better than the 
terrorists in Lebanon.

354
00:18:19,940 --> 00:18:24,940
You know,
I went to Israel this year and a visit 

355
00:18:24,940 --> 00:18:25,040
with my parents' grave.
I do not know if you know,

356
00:18:25,041 --> 00:18:27,650
my parents are bird with Oscar Schindler
and Mount Zion.

357
00:18:27,970 --> 00:18:29,680
And so this was the first time.

358
00:18:29,810 --> 00:18:33,080
Tell people how you ended up in Israel 
after leaving Lebanon.

359
00:18:33,620 --> 00:18:34,730
Well,
I left Lebanon.

360
00:18:34,731 --> 00:18:37,730
I ended up moving to Israel,
becoming these anchor for world news and

361
00:18:37,731 --> 00:18:41,180
working in Jerusalem.
And when my parents died,

362
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:46,640
I wanted to make sure that I burned them
in Israel because I wanted to make sure 

363
00:18:46,821 --> 00:18:50,930
that my children yet unborn will always 
know where my loyalty lies.

364
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:55,910
And because I'm a firm believer that 
actions speak louder than words.

365
00:18:57,200 --> 00:19:01,590
So I wanted to make sure I honor my 
parents because I adore my parents.

366
00:19:02,540 --> 00:19:04,400
This is a very sensitive subject with 
me.

367
00:19:04,750 --> 00:19:06,380
Uh,
I'm an only child.

368
00:19:06,470 --> 00:19:10,460
I worship my parents.
I live every single day of my life doing

369
00:19:10,461 --> 00:19:13,910
everything I do to honor them and their 
legacy and you know,

370
00:19:14,330 --> 00:19:18,920
speaking of hatred,
some former employer did me wrong when I

371
00:19:18,921 --> 00:19:23,921
was 22 years old and I remember sitting 
on my father's lap and he's wheelchair 

372
00:19:23,921 --> 00:19:25,250
hugging him.
I was crying and I said,

373
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:26,510
Oh Daddy,
I just hate them.

374
00:19:26,510 --> 00:19:29,540
I can't believe they did this to us.
And my father said to me,

375
00:19:29,541 --> 00:19:30,890
he said,
I never,

376
00:19:30,980 --> 00:19:33,620
ever want to hear that word coming out 
of your mouth.

377
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:38,800
I never raised you to hate.
And if for nothing else because of the 

378
00:19:39,171 --> 00:19:42,920
way I adore my father,
at that day,

379
00:19:43,070 --> 00:19:46,640
at 22 years old,
I vowed I will never hate somebody.

380
00:19:46,641 --> 00:19:49,670
My father died like two weeks later.
I will never,

381
00:19:49,671 --> 00:19:52,130
ever allow hate to enter my heart 
towards my enemies,

382
00:19:52,131 --> 00:19:54,380
towards anybody.
I don't hate anybody.

383
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:58,340
So when my parents died,
I buried them in Jerusalem.

384
00:19:58,341 --> 00:20:00,590
They are buried with Oscar Schindler and
Mount Zion.

385
00:20:00,740 --> 00:20:03,740
We're actually later he was brought in 
and buried next to them.

386
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:07,580
So this year I went back to Lebanon to 
Israel,

387
00:20:08,060 --> 00:20:10,610
and because I cannot go to Lebanon,
Hezbollah wants me dead.

388
00:20:10,910 --> 00:20:13,460
So I go to Israel.
I visited Israel,

389
00:20:13,490 --> 00:20:18,490
I meet with the idea of I actually was 
the first Lebanese person to ever make 

390
00:20:19,191 --> 00:20:22,040
it to the rooftop of the IDF 
headquarters in Tel Aviv,

391
00:20:22,370 --> 00:20:25,460
and I recorded videos with the 
spokesperson of the IDF and with the top

392
00:20:25,461 --> 00:20:28,640
generals were recorded videos to be 
broadcast to the United Nations,

393
00:20:28,641 --> 00:20:32,810
to the international community video to 
be broadcast to Lebanon about how,

394
00:20:32,811 --> 00:20:35,330
why we need to work together towards 
peace,

395
00:20:35,331 --> 00:20:36,770
why we need to love each other.

396
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:42,160
Potato aside,
forget what you're thought about the 

397
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:44,351
Jews.
Israel doesn't want anything but peace 

398
00:20:44,351 --> 00:20:44,351
with its neighbors.
Let's work together on peace.

399
00:20:44,351 --> 00:20:49,000
And for that,
Hezbollah aired that on Lebanese 

400
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:52,771
television they charged me with treason.
Now I am wanted that in Lebanon and 

401
00:20:54,041 --> 00:20:59,041
sentenced to death by hanging in to.
So here we have a group of terrorists in

402
00:20:59,951 --> 00:21:04,450
my home country of Lebanon who judged me
and who I am,

403
00:21:04,451 --> 00:21:09,451
and I deserve to be sentenced to death 
by hanging because they did not agree 

404
00:21:09,451 --> 00:21:12,370
with me preaching a message of love 
about being friends with the Jews.

405
00:21:12,730 --> 00:21:17,380
So here we have them calling me haters 
and yet I have the leftist in America,

406
00:21:17,381 --> 00:21:22,381
the southern poverty law center,
and these people calling me haters 

407
00:21:22,381 --> 00:21:23,350
simply because I'm warning about the 
Islamic terrorist threat.

408
00:21:23,390 --> 00:21:28,390
All right,
well you've got too much good in you to 

409
00:21:28,390 --> 00:21:29,981
focus on the haters.
But I do have one other question about 

410
00:21:29,981 --> 00:21:29,981
the haters and then we're gonna just put
it behind us,

411
00:21:29,981 --> 00:21:32,650
which is when marginalized sued the 
southern poverty law center.

412
00:21:32,690 --> 00:21:36,500
Now he's been removed from their anti 
Muslim extremists list.

413
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:39,140
And you were on there still as far as I 
know.

414
00:21:39,550 --> 00:21:40,910
Is I on still on there?

415
00:21:41,780 --> 00:21:43,250
Actually that.
Yeah,

416
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:44,470
yeah.
Still a over there.

417
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:46,430
Of course.
Are you kidding?

418
00:21:47,300 --> 00:21:48,440
Oh,
Linda Sarsour.

419
00:21:48,850 --> 00:21:50,280
Once you're A.
Yeah.

420
00:21:50,290 --> 00:21:54,770
Well once my private parts removed,
Ms Dot women's feminist movement,

421
00:21:54,771 --> 00:21:56,230
you know,
um,

422
00:21:56,510 --> 00:21:58,430
but that the world is turned upside 
down.

423
00:21:58,580 --> 00:22:00,790
So we are still on that list,
um,

424
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:06,400
sitter or a lawsuit or anything because 
I'm not generally for lawsuits in these 

425
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:10,481
cases,
but it magic proved that if they've 

426
00:22:10,481 --> 00:22:13,670
really wronged you and you can get the 
backing to get the lawyers to do it,

427
00:22:14,090 --> 00:22:16,280
that ultimately justice does prevail.

428
00:22:17,100 --> 00:22:22,100
We talk to our attorneys to sue them and
it's going to cost a lot of money and 

429
00:22:23,251 --> 00:22:28,251
they can drag it for years and years and
years have gotten onto 90 attorneys on 

430
00:22:28,251 --> 00:22:28,251
staff.
Well,

431
00:22:28,251 --> 00:22:30,510
we have to depend on the generosity of 
attorneys to do with pro bono.

432
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:34,230
They get dragged out forever.
Plus because I'm a public person and the

433
00:22:34,231 --> 00:22:38,070
head of an organization that will get us
into discovery,

434
00:22:38,220 --> 00:22:42,240
which means they not only can't subpoena
me,

435
00:22:42,300 --> 00:22:44,370
which I don't say anything,
but I'm not worried,

436
00:22:44,670 --> 00:22:49,670
but they can go after my chapters and 
any communications our chapters have 

437
00:22:49,670 --> 00:22:53,391
done with their friends.
Now our chapters are completely 

438
00:22:53,391 --> 00:22:56,901
independent.
Their members are completely 

439
00:22:56,901 --> 00:22:56,901
independent.
I don't even know who they are.

440
00:22:56,901 --> 00:23:01,190
So if somebody sent a personal email to 
a third party mentioning any worried 

441
00:23:01,190 --> 00:23:01,530
about,
hey,

442
00:23:01,560 --> 00:23:06,560
which we are completely not responsible 
for because they don't speak about 

443
00:23:06,560 --> 00:23:06,560
headquarters,
they can say,

444
00:23:06,560 --> 00:23:11,181
see,
we told you they've got people that 

445
00:23:11,181 --> 00:23:11,181
tight.

446
00:23:11,181 --> 00:23:11,940
And so because I do not know three,
four levels down,

447
00:23:11,941 --> 00:23:16,290
see Nash,
it doesn't have a national organization.

448
00:23:16,470 --> 00:23:18,900
Definitely not was chapters and members 
of the way we do.

449
00:23:19,140 --> 00:23:21,300
So he's only responsible for what he 
says.

450
00:23:21,450 --> 00:23:26,450
I can fight and defend what I say,
but I cannot fight and defend what 

451
00:23:26,450 --> 00:23:27,480
people don't.
I don't even know.

452
00:23:27,660 --> 00:23:29,910
Look,
the SPLC went after us and they said,

453
00:23:29,930 --> 00:23:31,140
oh,
we've got white supremacist.

454
00:23:31,141 --> 00:23:35,130
You know who show up to our rallies.
Round is on the side street corner.

455
00:23:35,560 --> 00:23:38,720
Anybody can stand on the side street 
corner or you know the.

456
00:23:38,740 --> 00:23:41,100
You cannot say that these members belong
to my organization,

457
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:46,640
but they do.
And that's the tactic of the left right 

458
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:46,640
now.
Alright,

459
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:46,640
let's focus on

460
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:51,100
the book.
So the subtitle is in Defensive Judeo 

461
00:23:51,100 --> 00:23:52,550
Christian values and freedom.
So just most simply,

462
00:23:52,551 --> 00:23:56,330
if someone said to you what our Judeo 
Christian values,

463
00:23:56,600 --> 00:23:58,550
what are they,
what are the most fundamental,

464
00:23:58,551 --> 00:24:00,390
Judeo Christian values that we need?
No.

465
00:24:00,830 --> 00:24:05,830
Well,
do they have Christian values are the 

466
00:24:05,830 --> 00:24:09,241
bedrock of Western civilization.
They are the foundation of what we have 

467
00:24:10,151 --> 00:24:14,980
today in America.
And this is not a religious book at all.

468
00:24:15,160 --> 00:24:16,810
You read it,
you endorsed it.

469
00:24:17,020 --> 00:24:22,020
It's not a religious one of the most 
fundamental freedoms.

470
00:24:22,171 --> 00:24:24,250
I'll give you a perfect example.
Freedom of speech.

471
00:24:24,580 --> 00:24:26,860
People don't realize where that freedom 
comes from.

472
00:24:27,100 --> 00:24:28,420
You know,
and Israel,

473
00:24:28,450 --> 00:24:31,810
the Hasidic Jews,
they debate the Bible.

474
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:34,150
They 24 hours a day.
That's all they do.

475
00:24:34,330 --> 00:24:36,610
They debate the Bible and what does that
come from?

476
00:24:36,611 --> 00:24:37,510
The Bible says,
come,

477
00:24:37,511 --> 00:24:40,810
let us reason together means let's 
debate ideas.

478
00:24:40,990 --> 00:24:42,310
I may not like your idea.

479
00:24:42,310 --> 00:24:47,310
You may not like mine and we could have 
five other people who make look at the 

480
00:24:47,310 --> 00:24:51,031
same verse completely differently,
but the reason why we debate ideas is 

481
00:24:51,031 --> 00:24:53,650
because we can learn from each other and
butter.

482
00:24:53,651 --> 00:24:58,651
Understand what statements mean were the
author who wrote that statement meant by

483
00:24:59,381 --> 00:25:04,381
it.
We all know that God didn't write the 

484
00:25:04,381 --> 00:25:04,381
Bible.
People wrote the Bible,

485
00:25:04,381 --> 00:25:06,010
so part of our fundamental way of 
thinking,

486
00:25:06,220 --> 00:25:11,220
the freedom of speech,
the ability to come together and debate 

487
00:25:11,220 --> 00:25:11,800
ideas and passionately debate these 
ideas,

488
00:25:11,980 --> 00:25:15,580
yet agreed to respectfully disagree and 
walk away.

489
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:19,420
People don't realize that comes from the
foundation of today,

490
00:25:19,421 --> 00:25:21,900
a Christian Foundation.
You know,

491
00:25:21,970 --> 00:25:24,580
even people who are not religious 
understand.

492
00:25:24,581 --> 00:25:27,280
That's so uniquely Western.
You know,

493
00:25:27,281 --> 00:25:28,950
they don't do that.
And,

494
00:25:28,990 --> 00:25:31,150
and,
and the Islamic world for example,

495
00:25:31,390 --> 00:25:33,460
you don't debate ideas.
Why?

496
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:36,520
Because in the car and the Qur'an was 
written,

497
00:25:36,521 --> 00:25:37,480
it's the word of God.

498
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:39,340
It's not debatable.
It's not negotiable.

499
00:25:39,370 --> 00:25:42,580
You can not look back.
You can add change versus you don't even

500
00:25:42,581 --> 00:25:47,581
talk about it.
You can even question it very different 

501
00:25:47,581 --> 00:25:48,010
than the way we are.
So when I write in the book about,

502
00:25:48,660 --> 00:25:53,660
and I actually,
I have a chapter titled The deaths of 

503
00:25:53,660 --> 00:25:53,660
Free Speech,
more.

504
00:25:53,660 --> 00:25:58,141
I talk about how we are losing our 
ability to speak the truth because then 

505
00:25:58,241 --> 00:26:00,160
your label,
your biggest people are afraid.

506
00:26:00,161 --> 00:26:05,161
Am I going to be blackmailed?
Am I going to be boycotted the by going 

507
00:26:05,161 --> 00:26:05,161
to lose my job?
Um,

508
00:26:05,170 --> 00:26:08,710
and so it's,
we're silencing ourselves and that's why

509
00:26:08,711 --> 00:26:12,140
I titled the Book Rise,
rise in defensive,

510
00:26:12,160 --> 00:26:16,120
Judeo Christian values and freedom 
because we're losing those freedoms,

511
00:26:16,270 --> 00:26:18,730
those American values before our very 
eyes.

512
00:26:18,840 --> 00:26:23,840
Are you watching this chip away more in 
Europe than in the United States right 

513
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:24,030
now?
For All our problems around this.

514
00:26:24,031 --> 00:26:29,031
And I agree it,
the bigger problem right now is that 

515
00:26:29,031 --> 00:26:29,150
we're silencing ourselves rather than 
the government coming to silence us.

516
00:26:29,151 --> 00:26:31,260
Although that could potentially be a 
problem in the future.

517
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:33,150
I don't sense.
It's a huge problem right now.

518
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:36,630
Europe has a whole other set of problems
around free speech.

519
00:26:36,631 --> 00:26:41,631
Do you think that they're more suited to
lose faster because they don't have a 

520
00:26:41,701 --> 00:26:42,900
first amendment the way we do?

521
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:44,100
Oh yeah.
That are far

522
00:26:44,100 --> 00:26:47,220
more advanced than losing their rights 
and their freedoms than we are.

523
00:26:47,460 --> 00:26:49,440
And they did it by self censorship.
You know,

524
00:26:49,441 --> 00:26:53,220
I landed the lung than I will speaking 
in London in 2007.

525
00:26:53,490 --> 00:26:58,490
So I land in London.
I'm a standing there waiting for my 

526
00:26:58,490 --> 00:27:01,430
luggage with the.
I'm a pilot and the hostess is,

527
00:27:01,700 --> 00:27:06,700
uh,
we were in a private section and they 

528
00:27:06,700 --> 00:27:06,700
said,
oh,

529
00:27:06,700 --> 00:27:06,700
what are you doing here?
And I said,

530
00:27:06,700 --> 00:27:07,530
Oh,
I'm just here for like three days.

531
00:27:07,531 --> 00:27:09,990
I'm giving a speech and parliament that 
was speaking to the,

532
00:27:10,190 --> 00:27:11,460
uh,
British parliament.

533
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:12,360
And they said,
oh,

534
00:27:12,361 --> 00:27:13,740
what are you going to be talking about?
And I said,

535
00:27:13,741 --> 00:27:18,600
the threat of radical Islam to world 
peace and national security and all of a

536
00:27:18,601 --> 00:27:22,260
sudden silence for 30 seconds you could 
hear a pin drop.

537
00:27:22,830 --> 00:27:24,840
They didn't know how to react to what to
say.

538
00:27:25,050 --> 00:27:27,370
They were so afraid to react less.

539
00:27:27,370 --> 00:27:30,060
Somebody hears something.
That backseat driver,

540
00:27:30,120 --> 00:27:34,140
my driver picked me up to drive me to my
hotel and we were talking in the car and

541
00:27:34,141 --> 00:27:35,370
I told them,
you asked me again,

542
00:27:35,371 --> 00:27:37,080
what are you doing here?
And I said the same thing.

543
00:27:37,620 --> 00:27:38,820
He said,
Bridgette,

544
00:27:39,090 --> 00:27:44,090
in 10 years I believe we're going to 
have blood on the streets of London by 

545
00:27:44,090 --> 00:27:46,650
radical Islamists.
We are at war.

546
00:27:47,460 --> 00:27:52,460
And it didn't even take 10 years.
Within five years we're already started 

547
00:27:52,460 --> 00:27:55,500
seeing stabbing on the streets of London
and stuff like that.

548
00:27:55,680 --> 00:28:00,680
So in Europe they are afraid to talk 
about it and they do not have the 

549
00:28:00,680 --> 00:28:04,401
freedom of speech that we have and 
that's why it's so important to defend 

550
00:28:04,401 --> 00:28:05,550
the freedom of speech that we have and 
God bless them.

551
00:28:05,551 --> 00:28:07,260
Our founding fathers would,
there was them,

552
00:28:07,261 --> 00:28:08,940
they knew exactly what they were doing.
I mean,

553
00:28:08,941 --> 00:28:10,770
look,
remember they came from Europe,

554
00:28:10,830 --> 00:28:15,830
so when they wrote us what they gave us 
the constitution and our bill of rights 

555
00:28:15,830 --> 00:28:19,401
and all of that stuff,
they knew exactly why they put some of 

556
00:28:19,401 --> 00:28:19,401
these amendments at there.

557
00:28:19,690 --> 00:28:21,420
So.
Alright,

558
00:28:21,460 --> 00:28:24,430
so let's just put a Europe aside.
Since we're in the United States,

559
00:28:24,431 --> 00:28:26,530
they're going to have to deal with that.
We'll deal with it here.

560
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:27,850
Um,
okay.

561
00:28:27,851 --> 00:28:31,390
We can get people to rise.
But what else do we have to do to have a

562
00:28:31,391 --> 00:28:36,391
discussion about this that's going to 
stop the people that are going to use 

563
00:28:36,391 --> 00:28:40,171
all of those labels.
So I know even in the book you make a 

564
00:28:40,171 --> 00:28:42,511
point of saying,
of course this is not all Muslims and 

565
00:28:42,511 --> 00:28:45,220
don't be bigoted towards Muslim.
People were talking about an ideology,

566
00:28:46,180 --> 00:28:48,130
a lot of people have been doing that for
the last couple of years,

567
00:28:48,131 --> 00:28:53,131
tried to separate people from ideas and 
all that and still get all the labels 

568
00:28:53,131 --> 00:28:54,010
thrown at them.
What are some of the other techniques we

569
00:28:54,011 --> 00:28:58,300
can use to talk about these things and 
not be crushed by by all the labor.

570
00:28:58,580 --> 00:29:03,230
Don't waste your breath because there is
nothing you can say at this point.

571
00:29:03,470 --> 00:29:05,930
No matter what you say,
the enemy,

572
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:07,970
the SPLC,
the Adl,

573
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:12,110
move on that or organizing for action.
All the progressive organizations,

574
00:29:12,350 --> 00:29:15,740
they're not willing to listen to you.
They don't want to listen to you.

575
00:29:15,980 --> 00:29:18,350
Look,
we organized a march against sharia,

576
00:29:18,351 --> 00:29:21,470
March for human rights last year,
a year and a half ago,

577
00:29:21,850 --> 00:29:26,850
and we had rallies in 29 cities in 21 
states and we timed put the pulse 

578
00:29:27,591 --> 00:29:31,250
nightclub bombing and Florida because it
was June 10th.

579
00:29:31,460 --> 00:29:36,460
We wanted to shine a light about the 
hatred of this ideology against gays.

580
00:29:36,920 --> 00:29:38,140
What they do to gays.
I mean,

581
00:29:38,190 --> 00:29:43,190
look at the pulse nightclub bombing.
The people organize our rallies in New 

582
00:29:43,190 --> 00:29:48,000
York.
It was organized and headed by two gay 

583
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,341
guys.
The rally in Atlanta was headed by a 

584
00:29:50,341 --> 00:29:51,250
Muslim man.
Do we had an emom speaking in Seattle.

585
00:29:51,430 --> 00:29:53,850
We had Miriam Abrahim,
the so then he's survivors.

586
00:29:53,860 --> 00:29:58,860
Speak at that rally in Virginia beach as
well as an Iranian Muslim leader of the 

587
00:29:58,860 --> 00:29:59,650
Iranian movement,
you know,

588
00:29:59,651 --> 00:30:00,250
to to,
to,

589
00:30:00,280 --> 00:30:05,280
to avoid from the mullahs.
Did you think any of the media covered 

590
00:30:05,280 --> 00:30:05,280
any of that?
All they did.

591
00:30:05,280 --> 00:30:06,880
They show up on the street corner,
say no.

592
00:30:06,940 --> 00:30:11,940
It's say no to say no to it.
They didn't even bother understand what 

593
00:30:11,940 --> 00:30:14,890
we were doing.
So don't waste your breath right now.

594
00:30:14,891 --> 00:30:16,570
People tell me,
why are you speaking to the choir?

595
00:30:16,571 --> 00:30:21,571
Bridget?
We need to talk to other people at this 

596
00:30:21,571 --> 00:30:24,331
time.
You need to mobilize the choir because 

597
00:30:24,331 --> 00:30:26,230
when you need your house cleaned,
it is the choir that shows up.

598
00:30:26,250 --> 00:30:28,540
It is the choir that brings you food.
When you're sick,

599
00:30:28,740 --> 00:30:32,350
it is the choir that mops the church or 
the temple when it needs cleaning.

600
00:30:32,351 --> 00:30:36,340
It's the choir that brings the flowers 
and that's all that matters to keep your

601
00:30:36,341 --> 00:30:40,270
house up and keep it protected,
and that's why right now,

602
00:30:40,271 --> 00:30:42,820
don't waste your breath on the labels.
Make sure you fight.

603
00:30:42,821 --> 00:30:44,590
Make sure you lobby our elected 
officials.

604
00:30:44,770 --> 00:30:47,440
Make sure you understand the power of 
the gavel,

605
00:30:47,560 --> 00:30:49,780
why it is important to call your elected
officials.

606
00:30:49,960 --> 00:30:54,960
You know in my book what makes this book
so unique is at the end of every 

607
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:57,220
chapter,
I have a section titled Dries Up and act

608
00:30:57,460 --> 00:30:59,050
where I give people ideas,

609
00:30:59,110 --> 00:31:01,000
so I want to do all that at the end.
I want all.

610
00:31:01,260 --> 00:31:03,160
I want all of your absolute advice on 
this,

611
00:31:03,161 --> 00:31:05,270
but what you hit on something that I 
think is really interesting there.

612
00:31:05,530 --> 00:31:09,640
There's a connection to all of this and 
the way the media reports.

613
00:31:09,730 --> 00:31:10,450
Yeah,
you're right,

614
00:31:10,451 --> 00:31:12,790
that when they cover your events or when
they cover,

615
00:31:12,791 --> 00:31:17,791
a lot of the.
The people that I'm friends with that I 

616
00:31:17,791 --> 00:31:17,791
have on the show,
whatever they say,

617
00:31:17,791 --> 00:31:22,350
it's like they only focus on the haters.
They only focus on the one little 

618
00:31:22,450 --> 00:31:27,450
outsider that's,
that's doing something that's bad and 

619
00:31:27,450 --> 00:31:27,450
not on all the good.
How,

620
00:31:27,450 --> 00:31:32,020
how do you think this happened to the 
media or is there a way that it can be 

621
00:31:32,020 --> 00:31:32,140
fixed or does it need to burn to the 
ground or what?

622
00:31:32,610 --> 00:31:36,810
Because the progressive media is not 
interested in dialogue.

623
00:31:37,020 --> 00:31:40,370
They are interested in winning.
See,

624
00:31:40,430 --> 00:31:43,220
we are on the conservative side,
you know,

625
00:31:43,230 --> 00:31:48,230
and it's such a shame.
I never thought of myself as a 

626
00:31:48,230 --> 00:31:48,230
conservative.
I mean,

627
00:31:48,230 --> 00:31:50,530
I don't know if I voted for Al Gore.
I was a proud democrat.

628
00:31:51,190 --> 00:31:52,200
Nine slash 11,
you know,

629
00:31:52,350 --> 00:31:54,450
conservative as they call us 
conservative.

630
00:31:54,750 --> 00:31:59,750
Uh,
but this is where we are in our nation 

631
00:31:59,750 --> 00:32:01,701
right now.
They consider people like you 

632
00:32:01,701 --> 00:32:01,701
conservative because you speak about,
you know,

633
00:32:02,580 --> 00:32:04,890
important issues that are now known as,
oh,

634
00:32:04,891 --> 00:32:06,540
that's what the conservatives talk 
about,

635
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:11,960
you know.
So what we are seeing right now is the 

636
00:32:11,960 --> 00:32:11,960
media is interested in winning.
Well,

637
00:32:11,960 --> 00:32:14,880
we are interested in having a dialogue.
How can we get through to them?

638
00:32:15,060 --> 00:32:16,950
How can we speak with them,
you know,

639
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:18,750
and,
and find the bridge where we can talk to

640
00:32:18,751 --> 00:32:20,940
them about that they're not interested 
in talking to us.

641
00:32:21,210 --> 00:32:26,210
They're interesting in silencing our 
voices and the sooner we know that the 

642
00:32:26,210 --> 00:32:29,250
better we are in fighting our battle and
learning how to win our battle.

643
00:32:29,460 --> 00:32:32,420
And you add to that funders like 
sorrows,

644
00:32:32,430 --> 00:32:33,150
you know,
and my book,

645
00:32:33,151 --> 00:32:38,151
I have a whole section about Soros and 
hadn't funding the media source right 

646
00:32:38,151 --> 00:32:39,520
now has spent.
Doesn't that mean,

647
00:32:39,590 --> 00:32:41,600
do you have an anti Semite if you talk 
about Soros,

648
00:32:41,601 --> 00:32:42,560
that's their new meme.

649
00:32:43,030 --> 00:32:46,390
I didn't even know he was Jewish until 
about a year ago.

650
00:32:46,391 --> 00:32:51,391
Right.
And everything he does is usually 

651
00:32:51,391 --> 00:32:53,401
against Israel and the height of 
stupidity.

652
00:32:53,910 --> 00:32:55,180
Uh,
I mean,

653
00:32:55,200 --> 00:33:00,200
you know,
you would think he sounds like an anti 

654
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:00,430
semite much more than me.
Remember,

655
00:33:00,431 --> 00:33:01,840
he is the one who works with the 
doctors,

656
00:33:01,841 --> 00:33:03,430
with the Nazis on,
on,

657
00:33:03,431 --> 00:33:04,210
on,
um,

658
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:06,370
actually had a smile when people ask 
them,

659
00:33:06,520 --> 00:33:11,520
how did you feel about going in and 
working with the Nazis against your own 

660
00:33:11,520 --> 00:33:11,520
people?
He said,

661
00:33:11,520 --> 00:33:11,520
well,
you know,

662
00:33:11,520 --> 00:33:13,940
somebody had to do it.
So I know I to say any problem with it,

663
00:33:14,410 --> 00:33:16,140
you know,
you're not making that up either way.

664
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:16,930
No,
no.

665
00:33:16,931 --> 00:33:21,931
I mean,
I watched his interview because I was 

666
00:33:21,931 --> 00:33:21,931
very interested on what makes this man 
the way he is.

667
00:33:21,931 --> 00:33:23,540
I studied my enemies,
uh,

668
00:33:24,280 --> 00:33:26,890
I spend a lot of hours actually studying
my enemies,

669
00:33:27,070 --> 00:33:29,140
uh,
to understand how they think,

670
00:33:29,141 --> 00:33:30,730
why,
why do they behave,

671
00:33:30,731 --> 00:33:32,050
you know,
trying to pick up on cues.

672
00:33:32,230 --> 00:33:34,300
So you look at somebody like George 
Soros,

673
00:33:34,600 --> 00:33:39,250
who is interested in transforming 
America into his vision of how the world

674
00:33:39,251 --> 00:33:44,251
should be and he has the billions and 
he's willing to spend that $43 billion 

675
00:33:44,251 --> 00:33:46,900
has already been spent on the media,
on Soros funded media,

676
00:33:47,030 --> 00:33:48,550
um,
and the teas from,

677
00:33:48,590 --> 00:33:49,870
uh,
since 2002.

678
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:55,080
And so when you look today at Soros has 
tentacles that extend to a 33 media 

679
00:33:55,901 --> 00:33:57,790
outlets including ABC,
NBC,

680
00:33:57,791 --> 00:33:59,110
CBS,
MSNBC,

681
00:33:59,320 --> 00:34:02,830
the Washington Post Associated Press,
which I detail in my book.

682
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:04,430
Uh,
even though the,

683
00:34:04,510 --> 00:34:06,220
to give you an example,
which I thought that the book,

684
00:34:06,460 --> 00:34:10,330
Columbia School of Journalism gave them 
$600,000

685
00:34:10,630 --> 00:34:15,630
to their journalism school because he 
wanted to impact the reporting on how 

686
00:34:15,630 --> 00:34:17,680
reporters report on the media issues in 
the future.

687
00:34:18,700 --> 00:34:20,620
So nobody was paying attention to this 
stuff.

688
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:25,000
But this is exactly how we ended up with
reporters who are no longer reporters.

689
00:34:25,001 --> 00:34:29,050
They are activists with a national 
platform media platform.

690
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:34,200
Whoa.
Get on television every night and 

691
00:34:34,200 --> 00:34:36,200
basically pure the same pocket political
points approved by Soros and they all 

692
00:34:36,371 --> 00:34:38,250
say the same thing,
whether it's the Huffington Post,

693
00:34:38,251 --> 00:34:40,270
the New York Times,
the Associated Press,

694
00:34:40,510 --> 00:34:42,250
Reuters,
MSNBC,

695
00:34:42,251 --> 00:34:43,420
CNBC,
ABC,

696
00:34:43,600 --> 00:34:46,300
the same buzzword and it's all 
coordinated.

697
00:34:46,470 --> 00:34:51,470
How concerned are you that on the social
media front where people like you have 

698
00:34:51,470 --> 00:34:51,510
been able to make gains?
You know,

699
00:34:51,511 --> 00:34:53,100
I'll see every now and again you'll talk
about,

700
00:34:53,101 --> 00:34:54,720
oh,
I just suddenly lost 5,000

701
00:34:54,721 --> 00:34:56,550
followers on twitter or something like 
that.

702
00:34:57,090 --> 00:35:00,060
That we're fighting a losing battle on 
that front.

703
00:35:00,090 --> 00:35:05,090
Ultimately because these companies are.
I think there are a lot of political 

704
00:35:05,090 --> 00:35:06,810
connections and who knows what's going 
on behind the scenes,

705
00:35:06,811 --> 00:35:11,811
but be,
they've basically embraced the leftist 

706
00:35:11,811 --> 00:35:15,951
ideology and they're not really around 
to make sure that bridgette Gabriel's 

707
00:35:15,951 --> 00:35:16,170
voice can be heard.

708
00:35:16,790 --> 00:35:21,790
Well,
we lose followers by the tens of 

709
00:35:21,790 --> 00:35:21,790
thousands,
tens of thousands,

710
00:35:21,790 --> 00:35:24,680
and we are seeing that happen,
especially now at a dramatic pace.

711
00:35:24,920 --> 00:35:29,920
Uh,
but you continue on doing what you are 

712
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:29,920
doing.
Is it,

713
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:30,080
there is nothing you can do to change 
it.

714
00:35:30,340 --> 00:35:32,060
Uh,
you just continue pushing.

715
00:35:32,120 --> 00:35:37,120
We are working with members of Congress 
to make sure that there's fairness and 

716
00:35:37,120 --> 00:35:40,751
reporting and that the government will 
intervene to make sure that we don't 

717
00:35:40,751 --> 00:35:45,321
have a monopoly look.
They did the same thing with 

718
00:35:45,321 --> 00:35:45,321
Microsoft's.
Remember Microsoft data monopoly.

719
00:35:45,321 --> 00:35:46,410
The government had to intervene and they
said,

720
00:35:46,411 --> 00:35:51,411
no,
you cannot stop anybody else who wants 

721
00:35:51,411 --> 00:35:53,771
to develop computers.
Apple didn't have a chance if the 

722
00:35:53,771 --> 00:35:53,771
government didn't intervene with 
Microsoft.

723
00:35:53,771 --> 00:35:57,210
So we know that there is precedent,
but here is the secret to success.

724
00:35:57,820 --> 00:36:02,820
My Libertarian brain,
all the bells go off on that stuff 

725
00:36:02,820 --> 00:36:02,820
though because I don't want the 
government to do it.

726
00:36:02,820 --> 00:36:04,930
It's like for me,
it's like be last resort,

727
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:08,200
even though I know that this is 
obviously a very personal issue to me as

728
00:36:08,201 --> 00:36:10,090
someone that puts this up on youtube and
the rest of them

729
00:36:10,140 --> 00:36:13,950
we want fairness.
We're not telling them silence anybody,

730
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:17,910
but we are saying to them,
allow people to speak their mind.

731
00:36:18,120 --> 00:36:20,610
You know,
if I owned a media platform and I do not

732
00:36:20,611 --> 00:36:24,900
agree with you at all in what you say,
as an American,

733
00:36:25,230 --> 00:36:30,230
I will bite my tongue and grit my teeth 
and listen to what I absolutely 

734
00:36:30,391 --> 00:36:32,010
passionately opposed.
I'm not saying you,

735
00:36:32,011 --> 00:36:33,420
but anybody you know,
you could be saying,

736
00:36:33,421 --> 00:36:35,250
you know what,
whoever,

737
00:36:35,580 --> 00:36:37,860
but I will fight for your right to do 
it.

738
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:42,270
I will not silence you because it is an 
American to silence you.

739
00:36:42,650 --> 00:36:46,980
So as Americans we owe it to each other 
at least to defend these,

740
00:36:46,981 --> 00:36:49,740
right?
So we can so we can pass them out.

741
00:36:49,741 --> 00:36:53,220
Our Future generations.
You never really own freedom,

742
00:36:53,221 --> 00:36:58,221
David.
We only preserve it for the future 

743
00:36:58,221 --> 00:37:00,501
generation.
And I said that statement with you 

744
00:37:00,501 --> 00:37:00,960
before and I actually have it going all 
throughout my book.

745
00:37:01,380 --> 00:37:05,820
These are the rights that our founding 
fathers gave everything and most of them

746
00:37:05,821 --> 00:37:08,790
died broke to give us these rights that 
we have today.

747
00:37:09,090 --> 00:37:11,430
The least we can do is preserve it for 
the next generation.

748
00:37:11,610 --> 00:37:16,610
That's all we're asking for.
But you know the secret to success 

749
00:37:16,610 --> 00:37:19,820
regardless of how much the social media 
puts you on facebook jail or twitter 

750
00:37:19,820 --> 00:37:20,040
bands,
your shadow,

751
00:37:20,041 --> 00:37:20,850
betty,
etc.

752
00:37:21,180 --> 00:37:22,710
Tenacity,
tenacity,

753
00:37:22,711 --> 00:37:24,870
tenacity.
You keep on pushing.

754
00:37:24,871 --> 00:37:27,900
You keep on pushing.
You keep on pushing and you never,

755
00:37:28,110 --> 00:37:29,820
ever,
ever give up.

756
00:37:29,970 --> 00:37:31,800
That is the secret to success.

757
00:37:32,010 --> 00:37:34,830
I appreciate we've talked for about 35 
minutes.

758
00:37:34,890 --> 00:37:38,940
We have not said the two words.
Donald trump.

759
00:37:39,900 --> 00:37:44,900
First up,
I think we just had a record 35 minutes 

760
00:37:44,900 --> 00:37:44,900
of conversation without saying once.
Okay.

761
00:37:44,900 --> 00:37:48,960
You are a trump supporter.
I'm a trumpeteer dear.

762
00:37:49,090 --> 00:37:50,400
Okay.
You're a trumpet tier.

763
00:37:50,580 --> 00:37:51,960
I think you've met with the president,
right?

764
00:37:52,040 --> 00:37:53,380
Yes.
Um,

765
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:55,120
how does.
Well,

766
00:37:55,130 --> 00:38:00,130
what?
Can you tell me something about him 

767
00:38:00,130 --> 00:38:01,641
maybe that the average person doesn't 
know or that you might not get through 

768
00:38:01,641 --> 00:38:05,661
the filter of cnn or that you maybe 
don't even get through the filter of 

769
00:38:05,661 --> 00:38:05,661
twitter.

770
00:38:06,020 --> 00:38:10,310
He is somebody,
he is a billionaire who left the life of

771
00:38:10,311 --> 00:38:15,311
luxury to serve the american people.
He is somebody who is not doing it for 

772
00:38:17,211 --> 00:38:18,950
power.
He already had power.

773
00:38:19,430 --> 00:38:21,980
He's not doing it for fame.
He already had fame.

774
00:38:22,490 --> 00:38:24,560
He's not doing it for the money.
He already had money.

775
00:38:25,400 --> 00:38:30,400
He doesn't care.
He wakes up every morning to all the 

776
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:34,000
insults and the hate and images of 
beheading by cathy griffith.

777
00:38:34,461 --> 00:38:39,461
That's his can watch and be mortified 
that somebodY actually really killed my 

778
00:38:39,461 --> 00:38:42,220
dad.
And then he remembers I'm not doing this

779
00:38:42,221 --> 00:38:47,221
to police the media.
I'm doing it because I'm fighting for 

780
00:38:47,221 --> 00:38:47,710
the american people.
They hate him.

781
00:38:48,190 --> 00:38:50,620
Not because,
um,

782
00:38:52,360 --> 00:38:54,490
they hate him because he is serving the 
american people.

783
00:38:54,491 --> 00:38:57,520
He is putting America first and they do 
not know how to handle him.

784
00:38:57,700 --> 00:39:02,700
And that's why Donald Trump is 
resonating with a lot of people in this 

785
00:39:02,700 --> 00:39:07,351
country,
from ceos of companies to janitors 

786
00:39:07,351 --> 00:39:09,580
working for $10 an hour because from the
janitor to the ceo,

787
00:39:09,700 --> 00:39:10,390
they know.

788
00:39:10,390 --> 00:39:15,390
And everybody in between.
President Donald Trump is working for 

789
00:39:15,390 --> 00:39:19,921
me.
And it's a breath of fresh air because 

790
00:39:19,921 --> 00:39:21,490
for decades now we have had manY 
presidents on the right and the left,

791
00:39:22,270 --> 00:39:26,140
not many people could say,
barack obama's working for me,

792
00:39:26,470 --> 00:39:30,310
or George Bush is working for me,
are clinton is working for me,

793
00:39:31,360 --> 00:39:36,360
but with Donald Trump,
the janitor knows president Donald Trump

794
00:39:36,760 --> 00:39:40,420
is working for me and that's why he's 
resonating with the people.

795
00:39:41,110 --> 00:39:44,740
So when You see the tweets and some of 
the over the top stuff,

796
00:39:45,490 --> 00:39:50,490
every now and again I'll watch some old 
clips from him in the eighties talking 

797
00:39:50,490 --> 00:39:53,180
to oprah or phil donahue and he's,
he's soft and seemingly plus,

798
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:58,200
you know,
very pleasant and open and you can see 

799
00:39:58,200 --> 00:39:58,200
the way inq and a's with audience 
members.

800
00:39:58,200 --> 00:39:59,100
I think our donahue,
he's,

801
00:39:59,110 --> 00:40:01,780
he's extremely human.
All of these things.

802
00:40:01,990 --> 00:40:05,650
and it's not exactly the caricature that
we get these days.

803
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:11,400
Do you think that he sort of became this
thing because it was the only.

804
00:40:11,770 --> 00:40:16,770
He basically was the.
It was the only way he would have been 

805
00:40:16,770 --> 00:40:17,020
hard enough to break through.
Does that make sense?

806
00:40:17,021 --> 00:40:22,021
Like I think he was probably extremely 
similar to the person from back then,

807
00:40:23,410 --> 00:40:28,410
but he became hardened because it was 
the only way you were going to ever 

808
00:40:28,410 --> 00:40:29,590
break through this like no one else was 
ever going to break through this thing.

809
00:40:30,220 --> 00:40:35,220
If you listen to Donald Trump,
today is the exact same person he was 25

810
00:40:40,151 --> 00:40:43,990
years ago when he was on phil donahue,
when he was on oprah,

811
00:40:44,200 --> 00:40:47,560
he still says the exact same words.
Have you noticed?

812
00:40:47,980 --> 00:40:49,240
Or the theme is the same,
but he's.

813
00:40:49,300 --> 00:40:51,160
He's hard in now.
There's like a,

814
00:40:51,310 --> 00:40:52,960
and I don't.
I'm not even blaming him for that.

815
00:40:52,961 --> 00:40:57,961
I think to go through this,
to go through the media machine and the 

816
00:40:57,961 --> 00:40:58,640
establishment and all that,
you've got to get hardened.

817
00:40:58,700 --> 00:41:02,770
Otherwise it will choke everybody out,
which is what fights to win.

818
00:41:02,980 --> 00:41:05,680
Before they didn't argue with what he 
said,

819
00:41:06,010 --> 00:41:11,010
so you didn't see that side of him.
He would have been just as hard back 

820
00:41:11,010 --> 00:41:11,010
then.
Today.

821
00:41:11,010 --> 00:41:12,730
They did not want to listen to every 
word he says.

822
00:41:13,180 --> 00:41:16,180
If he became jesus,
they will find a reason to fight against

823
00:41:16,181 --> 00:41:16,870
them.
They would call him,

824
00:41:16,871 --> 00:41:17,890
you know,
evil hater,

825
00:41:17,891 --> 00:41:18,970
monster,
whatever,

826
00:41:18,971 --> 00:41:19,750
whatever,
whatever.

827
00:41:20,200 --> 00:41:25,200
So the reason why they call him all the 
names that they call him now is because 

828
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:26,950
he has not toeing the line to them.
Look,

829
00:41:27,070 --> 00:41:29,520
he has 90 million followers on twitter.
He goes,

830
00:41:29,560 --> 00:41:31,810
trade around the media.
He doesn't need the media.

831
00:41:32,020 --> 00:41:35,420
He is communicating directly with the 
american people and the media hates this

832
00:41:35,540 --> 00:41:39,590
and he is somebody who fights the brand.
I love his Tweets by the way,

833
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:41,600
but it makes a lot of people 
uncomfortable.

834
00:41:41,600 --> 00:41:43,550
Oh my god,
I cannot believe he tweeted that.

835
00:41:43,660 --> 00:41:48,660
You know what?
We finally have a man who stands up to 

836
00:41:48,660 --> 00:41:51,050
the bullyism punches back.
We are so used to men who are whizzes in

837
00:41:51,051 --> 00:41:56,051
this country.
We have forgotten what it's like to see 

838
00:41:56,051 --> 00:41:59,201
a real man who stands up and says,
I respect myself too much to let you 

839
00:41:59,481 --> 00:42:02,930
walk all over me or call me that,
or treat me that way,

840
00:42:03,080 --> 00:42:05,330
but if you treat me that way,
I'm going to punch you back.

841
00:42:05,630 --> 00:42:07,280
Now.
stand up like a man and fight me.

842
00:42:07,580 --> 00:42:11,270
We forgot how women like that looks 
like,

843
00:42:11,630 --> 00:42:16,630
and so Donald Trump is shocking the 
system at a time where men have been 

844
00:42:17,541 --> 00:42:19,970
stripped out of their manhood.
They,

845
00:42:19,971 --> 00:42:21,500
you know,
uh,

846
00:42:21,501 --> 00:42:23,450
uh,
the socIety is changing,

847
00:42:23,860 --> 00:42:25,460
you know,
roles are changing.

848
00:42:25,610 --> 00:42:29,090
So in our society today,
they want the man that they can walk all

849
00:42:29,091 --> 00:42:30,200
over and,
you know,

850
00:42:30,201 --> 00:42:30,650
they say,
oh,

851
00:42:30,651 --> 00:42:32,690
we need somebody who is nice and you 
know,

852
00:42:32,870 --> 00:42:35,510
like romney or mccain,
you know,

853
00:42:35,840 --> 00:42:40,840
everybody loved mccain until he ran for 
president than they did the same thing 

854
00:42:40,840 --> 00:42:40,840
to him.

855
00:42:40,840 --> 00:42:41,840
Everybody loved wrongly until he ran for
president.

856
00:42:42,150 --> 00:42:44,120
They did the same thing.
I mean,

857
00:42:44,121 --> 00:42:49,121
if you would hear cnn talking about 
romney or mccain when they were running 

858
00:42:49,121 --> 00:42:49,121
for president,
they were saying the same thing,

859
00:42:49,121 --> 00:42:51,350
but he hated women.
All of those things.

860
00:42:51,351 --> 00:42:53,370
So same thing.
I'm completely with you on that part.

861
00:42:53,371 --> 00:42:58,371
But yeah,
that's what I mean by the hardening of 

862
00:42:58,371 --> 00:43:00,221
trump,
that he almost had to be this thing 

863
00:43:00,221 --> 00:43:02,270
because nobody else could have.
they tried it the other way.

864
00:43:02,271 --> 00:43:03,950
They tried it with knight,
you know,

865
00:43:03,980 --> 00:43:07,190
nicer people so to speak,
and it just doesn't work.

866
00:43:07,191 --> 00:43:08,720
So it's like,
well this is,

867
00:43:08,870 --> 00:43:13,870
this is the guy you're going to get.
I had his getting things done and the 

868
00:43:13,870 --> 00:43:16,040
american people are behind him and he is
resonating with the american people.

869
00:43:16,190 --> 00:43:19,430
And if his message wasn't resonating,
he wouldn't have the tens of millions of

870
00:43:19,431 --> 00:43:23,000
followers that are following them on 
social media and still rooting for him.

871
00:43:23,150 --> 00:43:28,150
And the Donald Trump supporters dig 
their heels even deeper where the only 

872
00:43:28,150 --> 00:43:31,340
attacks from the media,
even the attacks from his own party.

873
00:43:31,341 --> 00:43:32,130
Dave,
I mean,

874
00:43:32,150 --> 00:43:35,300
look you and I know there are people who
hates his guts in Washington dc.

875
00:43:35,450 --> 00:43:39,410
You talk about cleaning the swamp.
He is shaking everybody the left and the

876
00:43:39,411 --> 00:43:41,750
right,
despite all that,

877
00:43:42,020 --> 00:43:47,020
his support,
his approval rating is at an all time 

878
00:43:47,020 --> 00:43:47,020
high.
you know,

879
00:43:47,020 --> 00:43:49,490
so it doesn't matter what people are 
saying to him.

880
00:43:49,730 --> 00:43:52,880
He is doing what is right by the 
american people by America.

881
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:55,070
So what are some of the policies that 
he's doing that,

882
00:43:55,160 --> 00:44:00,160
that jive with this book?
Like in terms of borders and stuff like 

883
00:44:00,160 --> 00:44:00,160
that,
you're,

884
00:44:00,160 --> 00:44:01,280
you're for building the wall.
Absolutely.

885
00:44:01,281 --> 00:44:02,180
Yeah,
absolutely.

886
00:44:02,181 --> 00:44:07,040
And here's Why I am an illegal immigrant
to the United States.

887
00:44:07,370 --> 00:44:09,650
I understand what it's like for people 
to want to come here.

888
00:44:09,710 --> 00:44:13,550
I want it to come here so badly.
I remember getting an american flag,

889
00:44:13,551 --> 00:44:16,280
putting it under my pillow and my bomb 
shelter.

890
00:44:16,610 --> 00:44:19,730
And I couldn't wait to come to America.
I learned english.

891
00:44:19,731 --> 00:44:24,731
I don't know if I shared with you this 
was your less time writing subtitles on 

892
00:44:24,731 --> 00:44:25,430
my own that I tell you.
That's how I learned english.

893
00:44:25,431 --> 00:44:30,431
I never studied english at school.
I was so determined to come to the 

894
00:44:30,431 --> 00:44:34,031
United States that we would watch black 
and white television operated on a car 

895
00:44:34,031 --> 00:44:38,841
battery in our bomb shelter.
And my father would watch the news and 

896
00:44:38,841 --> 00:44:39,090
if there was any charge of the battery 
left,

897
00:44:39,091 --> 00:44:43,470
I would watch the love boat on wednesday
night and dallas on friday night.

898
00:44:43,890 --> 00:44:44,940
AnD you know,
we,

899
00:44:45,030 --> 00:44:47,650
we would have everything sometimes.
I know,

900
00:44:47,680 --> 00:44:51,960
I know that,
that that's what impacted my life.

901
00:44:52,450 --> 00:44:57,450
And,
and if two people looked into each 

902
00:44:57,450 --> 00:44:58,971
other's eyes and you know,
he said something to her and she said 

903
00:44:58,971 --> 00:45:01,851
maybe,
and they would rise with maybe what met 

904
00:45:01,851 --> 00:45:01,851
on the bottom.

905
00:45:01,851 --> 00:45:02,670
I knew that maybe meant whatever that 
word in arabic.

906
00:45:03,240 --> 00:45:06,390
And I would literally write it in ink on
my arm.

907
00:45:06,540 --> 00:45:08,640
And because we barely had water to 
drink,

908
00:45:08,641 --> 00:45:10,530
let along shower.
We showered once a week.

909
00:45:10,860 --> 00:45:15,860
I felt a huge victory valarie on my arm.
That's how I learned english because I 

910
00:45:15,860 --> 00:45:18,120
was so determined that if I ever meet an
american,

911
00:45:18,330 --> 00:45:23,330
I want to be able to be able to 
communicate with them in their language 

912
00:45:23,330 --> 00:45:26,040
so I can get to the United States.
And when I came to the United States,

913
00:45:26,450 --> 00:45:27,960
uh,
I came to America by marriage.

914
00:45:27,961 --> 00:45:30,840
I had married an american war 
correspondent in jerusalem.

915
00:45:31,200 --> 00:45:36,200
We came to America.
We put in my papers to become an 

916
00:45:36,200 --> 00:45:36,200
american.
I Flew here.

917
00:45:36,200 --> 00:45:40,311
I paid for my airline ticket,
paid for my attorneys to do all my 

918
00:45:40,311 --> 00:45:43,221
paperwork,
faith for my doctor's visit to do all 

919
00:45:43,221 --> 00:45:46,640
the needle,
poking to make sure I'm tested for this 

920
00:45:46,640 --> 00:45:49,101
disease and that disease to make sure 
I'm not bringing anything to the 

921
00:45:49,101 --> 00:45:51,561
country,
and then I had to study it through inch 

922
00:45:51,561 --> 00:45:55,220
thick book written by the daughters of 
the american revolution about america's 

923
00:45:55,220 --> 00:45:59,340
history and heritage and pass a written 
exam as well as a verbal exam in 

924
00:45:59,821 --> 00:46:00,540
english.

925
00:46:00,750 --> 00:46:03,300
Before I became an american.
I bought america's history.

926
00:46:03,780 --> 00:46:07,800
By the time I became an american,
I knew more about america's history than

927
00:46:07,801 --> 00:46:12,600
my own american born husband.
Did I am illegal immigrant.

928
00:46:12,900 --> 00:46:17,900
Those are the type of immigrants who 
need coming to America because we had a 

929
00:46:17,900 --> 00:46:20,940
fire in our belly to be all we can be as
americans right now.

930
00:46:20,941 --> 00:46:23,280
The people who are breaking the law to 
get here,

931
00:46:23,490 --> 00:46:28,490
not because they want to come here for a
better life or they are escaping 

932
00:46:28,490 --> 00:46:32,061
persecution.
Look at the care event that's coming to 

933
00:46:32,061 --> 00:46:32,760
the United States.
Mexico offered them asylum.

934
00:46:33,240 --> 00:46:36,150
Mexico offered them jobs.
They didn't want it.

935
00:46:36,240 --> 00:46:38,460
They're not there to seek jobs or 
asylum,

936
00:46:38,780 --> 00:46:43,780
they you and they passed literally by un
center setup specifically for those who 

937
00:46:44,041 --> 00:46:49,041
want asylum and claiming refugee status.
They didn't even stop continued coming 

938
00:46:49,351 --> 00:46:54,351
to the United States to the border and 
not even to the port of entry just to 

939
00:46:54,351 --> 00:46:55,080
break the law gets here.

940
00:46:55,500 --> 00:46:58,380
We have to have law and order in the 
country,

941
00:46:58,530 --> 00:47:00,240
so yes,
I support Donald Trump,

942
00:47:00,420 --> 00:47:05,420
build the wall and make sure anybody who
wants to come to the United States can 

943
00:47:05,420 --> 00:47:09,381
go through the proper channel and earn 
the privilege to be an american because 

944
00:47:09,720 --> 00:47:14,720
it is a privilege because people like me
who did it by the book are insulted and 

945
00:47:14,720 --> 00:47:19,250
offended when we see criminals are 
allowed to come in here and have the 

946
00:47:19,261 --> 00:47:24,261
same rights that we paid with our sweat,
heart and blood to get and work very 

947
00:47:24,271 --> 00:47:29,271
hard for years to become americans.
That's so fascinating to me because 

948
00:47:29,271 --> 00:47:29,740
they've also done plenty of studies on 
this.

949
00:47:29,741 --> 00:47:29,970
Were

950
00:47:29,980 --> 00:47:34,980
recent immigrants are actually against 
the caravan and against a lot of these 

951
00:47:34,980 --> 00:47:39,970
people.
not because they have anything against 

952
00:47:39,970 --> 00:47:39,970
the people,
but if you did it the right way,

953
00:47:39,970 --> 00:47:42,250
if you did it the way the law lays out,
well,

954
00:47:42,251 --> 00:47:47,251
then you don't want people just just 
storming over and that that is what a 

955
00:47:47,251 --> 00:47:47,251
nation of laws is,

956
00:47:47,251 --> 00:47:48,080
right,
and you don't.

957
00:47:48,090 --> 00:47:53,090
When you look at what illegal 
immigration is costing the United 

958
00:47:53,090 --> 00:47:53,530
States,
do you know that $45,

959
00:47:53,531 --> 00:47:58,531
billion dollars a year leaves America 
from those illegal aliens that come here

960
00:47:59,861 --> 00:48:03,100
to work in the United States,
that legal criminal aliens and they sent

961
00:48:03,101 --> 00:48:06,310
it to their countries of origin.
That mOney is not staying here.

962
00:48:06,460 --> 00:48:11,460
They're not here to become a part of the
american fabric to contribute to 

963
00:48:11,460 --> 00:48:12,010
american society,
to grow,

964
00:48:12,011 --> 00:48:17,011
to become all they can be.
They are here to use our system and 

965
00:48:17,011 --> 00:48:20,851
siphoned money and send it out there.
Do you know that it costs the american 

966
00:48:20,851 --> 00:48:24,151
public $200,000,000,000
a year and welfare expenses by criminal 

967
00:48:25,691 --> 00:48:30,691
illegal aliens to the United States.
3 million illegal aliens are 

968
00:48:30,790 --> 00:48:35,790
incarcerated dailY in american prisons.
Thirty percent of federal inmates in 

969
00:48:36,971 --> 00:48:39,400
federal prisons are illegal criminal 
aliens.

970
00:48:39,520 --> 00:48:41,860
So when you look at the cost,
when you add all the costs,

971
00:48:41,861 --> 00:48:45,010
and I can rattle in a bunch of points,
but when you add it all up,

972
00:48:45,100 --> 00:48:50,100
$338,000,000,000
a year is the cost of illegal 

973
00:48:50,351 --> 00:48:55,351
immigration to the United States.
The cost to build the wall is nothing 

974
00:48:55,351 --> 00:48:59,410
compared to what we're paying annually 
and a lift illegal criminal aliens.

975
00:48:59,590 --> 00:49:03,220
Not to mention the crimes killing our 
children,

976
00:49:03,480 --> 00:49:06,430
[inaudible] gangs coming here and what 
they're doing to our society.

977
00:49:06,580 --> 00:49:07,660
We don't want any of that.

978
00:49:07,720 --> 00:49:12,720
What do you make of the same people who 
will tell you that America is an evil 

979
00:49:12,720 --> 00:49:15,280
patriarchal capitalist,
that monster that also want open borders

980
00:49:15,281 --> 00:49:17,800
to apparently share in that horror with 
everybody else.

981
00:49:18,680 --> 00:49:20,400
AmerIca pretty,
pretty flawed.

982
00:49:20,401 --> 00:49:24,540
Thinking there would absolutely.
America is the most incredible nation on

983
00:49:24,541 --> 00:49:25,800
the face of the planet.
Look,

984
00:49:25,830 --> 00:49:28,290
you traveled the world.
You're traveling on a speaking tour.

985
00:49:28,590 --> 00:49:30,900
I was born and raised on the other side 
of the world.

986
00:49:31,320 --> 00:49:34,620
I understand you and I have traveled the
world.

987
00:49:34,621 --> 00:49:38,850
I mean from Australia to europe.
I mean we've been on a lot of places.

988
00:49:38,851 --> 00:49:41,370
You went on and we have seen how the 
other,

989
00:49:41,430 --> 00:49:43,830
the rest of the world lives compared to 
the rights that we have here.

990
00:49:44,010 --> 00:49:49,010
LOok,
our poorest of the poor who are living 

991
00:49:49,010 --> 00:49:50,040
on welfare,
have dishwashers in their government,

992
00:49:50,041 --> 00:49:52,860
paid housing,
have heating and air conditioning,

993
00:49:53,070 --> 00:49:54,960
have cell phones.
you know,

994
00:49:55,050 --> 00:49:59,670
these are luxury items and many other 
places in the rest of the world.

995
00:50:00,750 --> 00:50:03,420
Even in developed countries that are 
considered luxurY items.

996
00:50:03,630 --> 00:50:06,810
This is what we give to people who are 
living on welfare in the United States.

997
00:50:06,990 --> 00:50:09,930
So those will complain about America 
need to open their eyes.

998
00:50:09,960 --> 00:50:12,390
They need to go to India.
You go to the slums of India,

999
00:50:12,630 --> 00:50:15,210
they need to visit the Philippines.
They need to go to Vietnam.

1000
00:50:15,211 --> 00:50:20,211
They need to go to Egypt.
They need to see how the rest of the 

1001
00:50:20,211 --> 00:50:21,090
world lives and then come back to 
America and complain.

1002
00:50:21,210 --> 00:50:23,490
Isn't it just a lazy way of thinking 
really?

1003
00:50:23,491 --> 00:50:25,860
Because it's just easier to destroy than
create,

1004
00:50:25,861 --> 00:50:30,861
so it's just easier to sit after all of 
the hard one freedoms and tell you how 

1005
00:50:30,861 --> 00:50:34,310
horrible everything is rather than 
actually fix anything but burning things

1006
00:50:34,311 --> 00:50:35,240
down.
There's a lot easier,

1007
00:50:35,241 --> 00:50:35,450
right?

1008
00:50:35,950 --> 00:50:37,600
Exactly,
exactly.

1009
00:50:37,601 --> 00:50:38,480
And they uh,
and,

1010
00:50:38,590 --> 00:50:43,360
but no one's holding them accountable.
You see people like us and the old grade

1011
00:50:43,361 --> 00:50:45,610
generation who really fought world war 
two,

1012
00:50:45,611 --> 00:50:47,710
who are the veterans are still lying 
among us today.

1013
00:50:47,920 --> 00:50:49,810
Whoa.
Fought In the wars,

1014
00:50:49,811 --> 00:50:52,240
whether in Korea or in Vietnam or world 
war two.

1015
00:50:52,241 --> 00:50:55,390
I mean now they're getting older and 
fewer undying but their descendants.

1016
00:50:55,391 --> 00:51:00,391
So understand what America did to the 
world and the freedoms that we helped 

1017
00:51:00,391 --> 00:51:01,540
spread around the world.
Look,

1018
00:51:01,630 --> 00:51:06,630
we didn't want anything from the Japan.
We conquered nation and then we gave 

1019
00:51:06,630 --> 00:51:07,000
them their freedom and then rebuilt 
them.

1020
00:51:07,180 --> 00:51:12,180
who does that?
We didn't go to Iraq because we wanted 

1021
00:51:12,180 --> 00:51:14,970
oil.
We didn't go to Afghanistan because we 

1022
00:51:14,970 --> 00:51:16,801
wanted the oil.
We went there and started building 

1023
00:51:16,801 --> 00:51:17,650
schools on bridges for them to improve 
their lives and left and didn't take any

1024
00:51:17,651 --> 00:51:18,610
of the oil with us.

1025
00:51:18,970 --> 00:51:23,970
We want to improve the world and we need
the fight right now.

1026
00:51:24,580 --> 00:51:28,600
Those lazy american brats who are 
speaking ills of America,

1027
00:51:28,601 --> 00:51:32,110
who do not understand the America.
We need to come together,

1028
00:51:32,170 --> 00:51:36,220
organize and rise,
rise together in defense of America,

1029
00:51:36,430 --> 00:51:41,110
and that's why we need to come together 
and understand what we are facing,

1030
00:51:41,440 --> 00:51:44,740
how we are losing our country.
And this is what I get to in the book.

1031
00:51:44,950 --> 00:51:45,610
You know,
I say,

1032
00:51:45,730 --> 00:51:49,030
how did we go from the stories of George
Washington and the cherry tree?

1033
00:51:49,031 --> 00:51:54,031
I shall never tell a lie.
How did we go from that generation to 

1034
00:51:54,031 --> 00:51:55,150
the antifa thug?
So we're born and raised in America,

1035
00:51:55,151 --> 00:51:58,060
went to american schools,
paid for bY our tax dollars.

1036
00:51:58,270 --> 00:52:00,070
Who believe you can cheat,
you can lie,

1037
00:52:00,071 --> 00:52:02,550
you can still,
you can show up with machetes,

1038
00:52:02,880 --> 00:52:03,640
you uh,
and,

1039
00:52:03,660 --> 00:52:05,650
and brass knuckles.
YoU can hit people,

1040
00:52:05,890 --> 00:52:10,890
you can block bridges,
you can destroy property and you feel 

1041
00:52:10,890 --> 00:52:13,831
justified doing it.
How do we go in one generation and what 

1042
00:52:13,831 --> 00:52:16,570
lifetime from this to that.
And that's why we need to stand up.

1043
00:52:16,750 --> 00:52:21,750
Those of us who are in the middle who 
understand America greatness need to 

1044
00:52:21,750 --> 00:52:25,411
come together and stand up to fight to 
protect America while we still have a 

1045
00:52:25,411 --> 00:52:25,411
chance.

1046
00:52:25,411 --> 00:52:30,260
So what are the other judeochristian 
values that we need to be thinking 

1047
00:52:30,260 --> 00:52:30,260
about?
We talked about free speech.

1048
00:52:30,260 --> 00:52:34,701
What are the other bedrock principles 
that we need to fight back some of this 

1049
00:52:34,701 --> 00:52:34,701
stuff.

1050
00:52:34,701 --> 00:52:39,660
Oh my goodness,
we need to fight to protect our 

1051
00:52:39,660 --> 00:52:40,030
language.
Explained something very easy to you.

1052
00:52:40,210 --> 00:52:44,140
You we cannot lose our language.
Language unites people in one nation,

1053
00:52:44,141 --> 00:52:49,141
the english language right now,
we are importing people from different 

1054
00:52:49,141 --> 00:52:51,790
parts of the world and we are not making
them learn english.

1055
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:55,750
We now have public schools that have 16 
different languages that are spoken in a

1056
00:52:55,751 --> 00:52:58,410
public school and teachers will have to 
be trained to,

1057
00:52:58,530 --> 00:53:00,970
to speak a certain language to children 
instead of saying,

1058
00:53:01,240 --> 00:53:01,720
okay,
no,

1059
00:53:01,770 --> 00:53:06,770
you came to America,
you need to assimilate to need to learn 

1060
00:53:06,770 --> 00:53:08,881
english.
I know spanish people who have been in 

1061
00:53:08,881 --> 00:53:08,920
this country,
mexican people for over 20 years,

1062
00:53:08,921 --> 00:53:12,130
they still cannot speak english properly
or they speak very little english.

1063
00:53:12,490 --> 00:53:14,920
That's not acceptable.
That's not what made America great.

1064
00:53:15,130 --> 00:53:20,130
We have got to enforce that english is 
the official language of the United 

1065
00:53:20,130 --> 00:53:20,440
States and shall remain.

1066
00:53:20,440 --> 00:53:22,720
So we welcome people from all 
backgrounds.

1067
00:53:22,930 --> 00:53:25,090
The immigrants that came to this country
back,

1068
00:53:25,140 --> 00:53:26,850
the jews that came from all over the 
world,

1069
00:53:27,180 --> 00:53:28,760
the irish catholics,
they,

1070
00:53:28,770 --> 00:53:31,080
everybody,
they came to the United States.

1071
00:53:31,140 --> 00:53:36,140
They made sure their children spoke 
english because they wanted their kids 

1072
00:53:36,140 --> 00:53:40,701
to become as american as apple pie,
as fast as possible to assimilate into 

1073
00:53:40,701 --> 00:53:42,690
the society.
We're not seeing that right now.

1074
00:53:42,960 --> 00:53:46,020
We are seeing in detroit,
you call government the office,

1075
00:53:46,021 --> 00:53:47,480
you're getting in arabic,
you know,

1076
00:53:47,910 --> 00:53:50,730
and then you push like forfor english,
arabic,

1077
00:53:50,731 --> 00:53:52,980
and then you got spanish and then you 
get this and this and that.

1078
00:53:53,220 --> 00:53:56,970
That's unacceptable and people need to 
understand their power.

1079
00:53:57,270 --> 00:53:59,880
And my book,
at the end of every chapter,

1080
00:53:59,881 --> 00:54:04,020
I have a section title dries up and act.
No matter what I'm talking about,

1081
00:54:04,200 --> 00:54:07,560
I give people ideas and tips.
Three things you can do under 10 minutes

1082
00:54:07,561 --> 00:54:12,561
that will make a difference for the 
country and you can do them slipping 

1083
00:54:12,561 --> 00:54:13,650
your cup of coffee in your pajamas at 
7:00

1084
00:54:13,650 --> 00:54:17,010
AM in the morning to give you an idea,
calling your elected official.

1085
00:54:17,370 --> 00:54:18,360
Many people say,
bridgette,

1086
00:54:18,450 --> 00:54:23,450
what is my voice going to count?
My eleCted official needs to hear from 

1087
00:54:23,450 --> 00:54:24,660
40,000
people before they do something wrong.

1088
00:54:24,840 --> 00:54:27,870
I talked to elected officials all the 
time and I asked them,

1089
00:54:28,140 --> 00:54:32,190
how many people do you need to hear from
about a single issue to make it your top

1090
00:54:32,250 --> 00:54:34,470
priority?
You'll be shocked.

1091
00:54:35,040 --> 00:54:35,850
How many do you think?

1092
00:54:36,670 --> 00:54:40,330
I mean it's got to be so ridiculously 
low because nobody calls them and we all

1093
00:54:40,331 --> 00:54:45,331
think it's 40,000,
but it's probably like 50 people or 

1094
00:54:45,331 --> 00:54:45,331
something.

1095
00:54:45,331 --> 00:54:48,630
That's it.
Forty to 50 people and here is the 

1096
00:54:48,630 --> 00:54:50,380
science behind the numbers.
They believe if one person makes a phone

1097
00:54:50,381 --> 00:54:54,010
call or writes a letter,
he or she are representing $1,000,

1098
00:54:54,060 --> 00:54:59,060
but they those who feel the same way but
are too lazy to make a phone call or 

1099
00:54:59,060 --> 00:55:00,850
write a letter.
Yet they vote on election day.

1100
00:55:01,090 --> 00:55:05,920
That translates to 40 to 50,000
voters on election day.

1101
00:55:06,160 --> 00:55:09,520
That can make or break an election.
So I tell people,

1102
00:55:09,730 --> 00:55:12,370
you can be active sitting in traffic.
I look,

1103
00:55:12,490 --> 00:55:17,490
we are in la.
How many hours do you spend sitting in 

1104
00:55:17,490 --> 00:55:21,061
traffic?
I spent two and a half hours yesterday 

1105
00:55:21,061 --> 00:55:21,850
sitting in traffic trying to go 50 miles
program,

1106
00:55:21,910 --> 00:55:26,910
the white house phone number program,
your elected officials phone number in 

1107
00:55:26,910 --> 00:55:26,910
your,
in your,

1108
00:55:26,910 --> 00:55:31,180
uh,
cell phone when you get a text alert 

1109
00:55:31,180 --> 00:55:31,180
from us about a bill coming down for a 
vote,

1110
00:55:31,180 --> 00:55:33,670
punch a button,
click and call your elected officials,

1111
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:35,050
or send an email.

1112
00:55:35,800 --> 00:55:40,800
When people go to act for america.org,
which I mentioned all throughout the 

1113
00:55:40,800 --> 00:55:41,410
book,
my organization act for America,

1114
00:55:41,411 --> 00:55:44,170
that org,
they can click on contact congress.

1115
00:55:44,260 --> 00:55:46,330
They can sign up to get our emails and 
action alerts.

1116
00:55:46,331 --> 00:55:48,700
We send emails about bill's coming down 
for a vote.

1117
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:50,650
The bill number,
who sponsors it,

1118
00:55:50,680 --> 00:55:55,680
what it says.
We even have pre written letters for 

1119
00:55:55,680 --> 00:55:57,730
them that they can email their elected 
officials with the click of a button.

1120
00:55:57,731 --> 00:56:02,020
It'll go to your elected official 
letters to the editors and script.

1121
00:56:02,021 --> 00:56:04,390
I give samples in this book.
The last chapter,

1122
00:56:04,391 --> 00:56:09,391
the whole chapter is samples about 
activism samples about letters to the 

1123
00:56:09,581 --> 00:56:14,581
editor.
all you have to do is add your name and 

1124
00:56:14,581 --> 00:56:14,581
send it to your newspaper.

1125
00:56:14,581 --> 00:56:15,570
As part of the problem that we put so 
much emphasis on the presidency,

1126
00:56:15,571 --> 00:56:18,170
so it's great.
You're doing local activism.

1127
00:56:18,180 --> 00:56:21,270
You're saying call your congressman if 
you've got a problem with your exit.

1128
00:56:21,271 --> 00:56:26,271
My exit right here where I live,
I don't want to say exactly where it's 

1129
00:56:26,271 --> 00:56:26,350
filled with garbage for the two years 
that I've been living here,

1130
00:56:26,351 --> 00:56:29,120
david's been calling this guy nonstop to
get the.

1131
00:56:29,130 --> 00:56:30,880
He wants to go out there and start 
picking up stuff,

1132
00:56:30,881 --> 00:56:32,520
but it's too dangerous,
but it's just.

1133
00:56:32,530 --> 00:56:37,530
But like nobody focuses on local anymore
because we put such emphasis on the 

1134
00:56:38,201 --> 00:56:43,201
executive branch,
on the cult of personality around the 

1135
00:56:43,201 --> 00:56:45,871
presidency.
So it's like by going to your local 

1136
00:56:45,871 --> 00:56:47,830
congressman or congresswoman,
you might actually get something done.

1137
00:56:47,890 --> 00:56:49,480
It's a lot harder to do it the other 
way.

1138
00:56:49,730 --> 00:56:52,830
Absolutely.
And and on the local elected offiCials,

1139
00:56:52,831 --> 00:56:53,660
you kNow,
your local,

1140
00:56:53,661 --> 00:56:58,661
state aNd delegates,
I may have you called the guy at the 12 

1141
00:56:58,661 --> 00:56:58,661
people.
That's it.

1142
00:56:58,670 --> 00:57:01,190
And so this is why we started chapters 
nationwide.

1143
00:57:01,191 --> 00:57:02,840
This is why we have activists 
nationwide.

1144
00:57:02,841 --> 00:57:05,090
I tell people,
go to act for America.

1145
00:57:05,330 --> 00:57:09,360
That org sign up as an activist.
Joined a chapter or started chapter,

1146
00:57:09,390 --> 00:57:14,390
there's a chapter near you.
Everything happens on a local level 

1147
00:57:14,390 --> 00:57:15,920
because those local elected officials 
that you develop a connection with,

1148
00:57:15,921 --> 00:57:19,310
an eye contact,
go to become state elected officials.

1149
00:57:19,660 --> 00:57:21,920
Then federal elected officials,
attorney generals,

1150
00:57:21,921 --> 00:57:23,540
and then state senators,
congressmen.

1151
00:57:23,930 --> 00:57:28,930
This is how we change society and so I 
encourage people to get involved and 

1152
00:57:28,930 --> 00:57:33,251
become engagement.
That's exactly what this book is a 

1153
00:57:33,251 --> 00:57:36,101
roadmap for people on how to rise,
rise this title that dries,

1154
00:57:37,440 --> 00:57:42,440
you know,
people need to get this book and they 

1155
00:57:42,440 --> 00:57:45,260
need to donate it to every library in 
their community.

1156
00:57:45,261 --> 00:57:47,420
So when people are looking to find out 
information,

1157
00:57:47,660 --> 00:57:49,640
they can find it.
Read it for yourself,

1158
00:57:49,641 --> 00:57:51,590
donate it to a public library in your 
community,

1159
00:57:51,591 --> 00:57:56,591
get multiple copies.
We want people to learn how they can be 

1160
00:57:56,591 --> 00:57:58,250
mobilized.
The left understands how to mobilize.

1161
00:57:58,460 --> 00:58:00,440
We on the right,
understand the issues,

1162
00:58:00,620 --> 00:58:03,470
but do not know how to mobilize.
And that's what this book teaches them.

1163
00:58:04,260 --> 00:58:05,370
So what?
What else?

1164
00:58:05,430 --> 00:58:10,430
What else can we do?
I feel like you got a couple of other 

1165
00:58:10,430 --> 00:58:10,430
tricks up your sleeve.

1166
00:58:10,430 --> 00:58:10,430
Oh,
absolutely.

1167
00:58:10,430 --> 00:58:15,420
Sexy.
It can't just be calling your 

1168
00:58:15,420 --> 00:58:15,420
congressman,

1169
00:58:15,420 --> 00:58:16,830
make new friends,
find out,

1170
00:58:16,860 --> 00:58:19,380
start a chapter,
you'll get to meet the great new friends

1171
00:58:19,381 --> 00:58:21,960
in your community.
If people sign up to be a chapter leader

1172
00:58:21,961 --> 00:58:24,910
with us,
we will connect them with the same group

1173
00:58:24,920 --> 00:58:28,170
in their local community who sign up for
our emails and they say,

1174
00:58:28,171 --> 00:58:33,171
I want to join a chapter.
I want to meet people in my community 

1175
00:58:33,171 --> 00:58:33,171
like this.
We connect them together.

1176
00:58:33,171 --> 00:58:35,820
They can do local activities together.
They can go out to dinners together.

1177
00:58:35,970 --> 00:58:38,910
They can work on issues relating to 
their community.

1178
00:58:39,150 --> 00:58:42,600
I have found I have made the best 
friends doing my activism.

1179
00:58:42,780 --> 00:58:44,730
That's what launched my career in 
activism.

1180
00:58:44,910 --> 00:58:47,640
So this is the type of ideas that people
can do.

1181
00:58:47,880 --> 00:58:50,460
Come together and work together.
Have on a saturday,

1182
00:58:50,461 --> 00:58:52,440
one saturday,
I have a meeting,

1183
00:58:52,480 --> 00:58:57,480
a chapter meeting once a month,
write letters to your congressman about 

1184
00:58:57,480 --> 00:58:57,510
the garbage on the side of the street.

1185
00:58:57,810 --> 00:59:00,210
You know,
we need to clean this garbage out.

1186
00:59:00,240 --> 00:59:04,530
This is unacceptable.
A probe test builds up or coming down.

1187
00:59:04,680 --> 00:59:09,680
I'll give you an idea.
We're accepting all these refugees 

1188
00:59:09,680 --> 00:59:12,081
coming in here,
so right now we are bringing our 

1189
00:59:12,081 --> 00:59:15,171
standards down to accommodate the 
standards of people from third world 

1190
00:59:15,171 --> 00:59:15,450
country.
To give you an example,

1191
00:59:15,451 --> 00:59:20,451
the city of denver in 2017 passed an 
ordinance that allowed people to on the 

1192
00:59:22,341 --> 00:59:23,900
sidewalk.
Why?

1193
00:59:24,110 --> 00:59:29,110
because they have a lot of illegal 
immigrants who feel no problem to just 

1194
00:59:29,151 --> 00:59:31,160
drop their pants and do it on the side 
of the road,

1195
00:59:31,460 --> 00:59:36,460
but because it is a deportable crime,
because that crime is punishable up to 

1196
00:59:36,460 --> 00:59:38,360
one year in jail and if you commit such 
a crime,

1197
00:59:38,361 --> 00:59:43,361
you are deported.
The city of denver has a bigger problem 

1198
00:59:43,361 --> 00:59:44,270
with illegal immigration than san 
francisco and philadelphia,

1199
00:59:44,750 --> 00:59:47,600
so that's why they passed the ordinance.
They did not want people deported.

1200
00:59:47,810 --> 00:59:52,810
Can you imagine if you have a chapter 
with 30 people or 30 people organizing 

1201
00:59:52,810 --> 00:59:57,551
together on the same issue,
calling your local state government 

1202
00:59:57,551 --> 01:00:01,180
saying,
this is unacceptable and if you don't 

1203
01:00:01,180 --> 01:00:03,791
change that,
we're going to vote you out and replace 

1204
01:00:03,791 --> 01:00:03,791
you.
That's how the left does it.

1205
01:00:03,791 --> 01:00:04,490
That's how we need to do it.

1206
01:00:04,570 --> 01:00:09,570
That's a pretty clear one where you 
could probably escape some of the cries 

1207
01:00:09,570 --> 01:00:09,570
of racism,
right,

1208
01:00:09,570 --> 01:00:11,690
because nobody wants their streets 
filled up with pooper.

1209
01:00:11,740 --> 01:00:16,740
You know,
san francisco has this app that'll tell 

1210
01:00:16,740 --> 01:00:16,740
you where human poop is

1211
01:00:16,740 --> 01:00:20,080
unbelievable and now that diseases that 
are spreading because of that,

1212
01:00:20,170 --> 01:00:21,910
and this is something I mentioned in the
book,

1213
01:00:22,240 --> 01:00:25,100
all the rise in diseases in our country,
you know,

1214
01:00:25,180 --> 01:00:30,180
you've heard right now,
but the lyme disease or that disease 

1215
01:00:30,180 --> 01:00:32,461
that's not being transferred to people 
because in san francisco you've got 

1216
01:00:32,461 --> 01:00:37,111
flies basically eating that human waste 
and then you're walking down the street 

1217
01:00:37,121 --> 01:00:40,570
and they're biting you,
so mosquitoes now are transferring these

1218
01:00:40,571 --> 01:00:45,370
diseases that were once eliminated in 
the United States by simply eating human

1219
01:00:45,371 --> 01:00:48,040
waste and them biting you with putting 
it in your body.

1220
01:00:48,250 --> 01:00:50,110
This is exactly why I bought a month 
ago.

1221
01:00:50,111 --> 01:00:51,070
We started seeing,
you know,

1222
01:00:51,280 --> 01:00:53,290
this disease pop up.
People cannot explain it.

1223
01:00:53,410 --> 01:00:55,630
some people died.
Tuberculosis,

1224
01:00:55,631 --> 01:00:58,300
for example,
is exploding in the United States.

1225
01:00:58,670 --> 01:01:01,960
The top four states with tuberculosis 
are California.

1226
01:01:01,961 --> 01:01:04,150
Over 500 cases.
Florida,

1227
01:01:04,480 --> 01:01:09,480
Texas and New York.
A 16 states are now grappling with 

1228
01:01:10,211 --> 01:01:10,960
tuberculosis.

1229
01:01:10,980 --> 01:01:13,270
It is the fAstest growing disease in 
America right now.

1230
01:01:13,720 --> 01:01:18,720
They have state of Wisconsin alone has 
116 cases of tuberculosis and the 

1231
01:01:19,931 --> 01:01:24,190
majority of them are drug resistant,
which means it takes six months to treat

1232
01:01:24,191 --> 01:01:29,191
a patient and it takes six to eight 
months to treat them at the cost of 

1233
01:01:29,191 --> 01:01:32,500
$150,000
per patient out of our tax dollars.

1234
01:01:32,800 --> 01:01:37,800
These are issues we need to talk about.
THese are issues affecting our 

1235
01:01:37,800 --> 01:01:39,460
communities and that's what I what I 
discussed in the book.

1236
01:01:39,580 --> 01:01:42,430
So it's not only about national security
per se,

1237
01:01:42,580 --> 01:01:47,580
it's why we need to rise in defense of 
our culture and our freedoms and what 

1238
01:01:47,580 --> 01:01:47,580
made America great.

1239
01:01:47,580 --> 01:01:52,510
Do you find that the people that are 
part of act are diverse politically 

1240
01:01:52,510 --> 01:01:52,510
because it's.
So.

1241
01:01:52,510 --> 01:01:55,130
It's interesting.
I mean I've spent hours with you now and

1242
01:01:55,131 --> 01:01:58,340
it's like,
I guess you're a conservative but you're

1243
01:01:58,341 --> 01:01:58,800
not,
you're,

1244
01:01:58,801 --> 01:02:00,410
you're sort of my kind of conservative.

1245
01:02:04,080 --> 01:02:04,410
Right?

1246
01:02:05,030 --> 01:02:06,670
Really.
You're like my kind of liberal,

1247
01:02:06,671 --> 01:02:11,671
which you,
which you know is half conservative at 

1248
01:02:11,671 --> 01:02:11,671
this point because everything is so 
upside down,

1249
01:02:11,800 --> 01:02:16,800
but do you find that you get a real mix 
of a political views in the people that 

1250
01:02:16,871 --> 01:02:17,410
are coming to you?

1251
01:02:17,630 --> 01:02:20,430
Oh my gosh,
look with our organizations.

1252
01:02:20,431 --> 01:02:25,431
I mean we Have everybody,
people that put their differences aside 

1253
01:02:25,431 --> 01:02:29,780
and came together for the safety and 
security of America and preserving 

1254
01:02:29,780 --> 01:02:34,700
whole.
We are as americans and defending our 

1255
01:02:34,700 --> 01:02:35,760
american values.
Our members are jews,

1256
01:02:35,790 --> 01:02:36,960
christians,
buddhists,

1257
01:02:37,170 --> 01:02:38,370
hindus,
atheists,

1258
01:02:38,400 --> 01:02:39,660
gays,
lesbians.

1259
01:02:39,840 --> 01:02:42,090
I mean,
I've got gay chapter leaders,

1260
01:02:42,960 --> 01:02:45,690
chapter leaders.
We've got to everybody.

1261
01:02:45,990 --> 01:02:48,810
People like you and I and everybody else
that put.

1262
01:02:49,360 --> 01:02:49,970
Yeah,
you know,

1263
01:02:50,040 --> 01:02:52,290
people may not agree on every single 
social issues,

1264
01:02:52,710 --> 01:02:57,710
but people agree on a lot of things that
make us americans because we love each 

1265
01:02:57,710 --> 01:03:02,001
other as americans.
We respect eacH other as americans and 

1266
01:03:02,001 --> 01:03:04,140
we want to defend our country and the 
principles that made it great.

1267
01:03:04,620 --> 01:03:07,290
And so that's why we work together.
And it's like I said,

1268
01:03:07,320 --> 01:03:09,460
it's such a shame that no people,
you know,

1269
01:03:09,600 --> 01:03:11,020
I never thought I would be.

1270
01:03:11,100 --> 01:03:11,650
I,
you know,

1271
01:03:11,730 --> 01:03:15,330
I will be called the conservative or you
will be called the conservative,

1272
01:03:15,630 --> 01:03:18,110
but you know what?
As far as the leftist concern,

1273
01:03:18,120 --> 01:03:20,190
right now,
you and I are conservatives.

1274
01:03:20,740 --> 01:03:23,640
That doesn't matter that you are a 
married gay man.

1275
01:03:24,420 --> 01:03:29,420
You're a conservative.
Welcome to the new conservatism and you 

1276
01:03:29,420 --> 01:03:33,831
know,
this is why when Donald Trump talks 

1277
01:03:33,831 --> 01:03:34,350
about nationalism,
we aren't nationalist country.

1278
01:03:34,830 --> 01:03:39,830
We are,
we are standing up as a nation to fight 

1279
01:03:39,830 --> 01:03:43,130
what makes America great patriotic 
american.

1280
01:03:43,290 --> 01:03:45,630
You know the patriotism that we have in 
America.

1281
01:03:45,960 --> 01:03:47,460
They don't have another countries of the
world.

1282
01:03:47,760 --> 01:03:50,550
You go to Australia,
you don't see the australian flag flying

1283
01:03:50,551 --> 01:03:55,551
everywhere you go to england.
You don't see that in british flag 

1284
01:03:55,551 --> 01:03:55,551
everywhere.
We noticed that when I was in here.

1285
01:03:55,551 --> 01:04:00,550
Now that you're traveling worldwide,
what makes America so unique is this 

1286
01:04:02,131 --> 01:04:05,160
nationalism that brings us altogether 
our love for country.

1287
01:04:05,490 --> 01:04:09,840
People go to baseball games and we 
played tHe national anthem.

1288
01:04:09,960 --> 01:04:11,760
You know,
they don't do that in other parts of the

1289
01:04:11,761 --> 01:04:16,761
world.
They don't play the national anthem 

1290
01:04:16,761 --> 01:04:18,891
before games.
We take it for granted and now 

1291
01:04:18,891 --> 01:04:21,591
everybody's upset with the president 
because he's talking about american 

1292
01:04:21,591 --> 01:04:21,591
nationalism.
What?

1293
01:04:21,591 --> 01:04:23,580
What brings us together?
They need to travel to Australia,

1294
01:04:23,940 --> 01:04:26,480
go to Canada,
go to Germany,

1295
01:04:26,490 --> 01:04:31,490
attend a a football,
think they don't play the national 

1296
01:04:31,490 --> 01:04:33,120
anthem.
It's not like the United States.

1297
01:04:33,360 --> 01:04:36,510
THat's what he was referring to.
We're talking about our nationalism.

1298
01:04:36,660 --> 01:04:39,640
What brings us together as americans,
our americanism.

1299
01:04:39,710 --> 01:04:42,210
He could have used a different word.
Americanism.

1300
01:04:42,211 --> 01:04:44,700
So the word,
so the left will not feel offended,

1301
01:04:44,880 --> 01:04:46,950
but that's what he was talking about.
Pretty fair.

1302
01:04:46,951 --> 01:04:51,951
they would have offended either way.
They would have been offended either 

1303
01:04:51,951 --> 01:04:54,291
way.
I feel I should give you the chance to 

1304
01:04:54,291 --> 01:04:54,291
close this with this speech as epic as 
your last,

1305
01:04:54,320 --> 01:04:57,180
although you've done about five of them 
here in the last hour,

1306
01:04:57,390 --> 01:05:00,740
but do you want to give me a closing 
statement that will be memorable.

1307
01:05:02,430 --> 01:05:05,820
Footprints in history are not made 
sitting down.

1308
01:05:06,780 --> 01:05:10,080
Countries cannot be saved by Hashtags 
and tweets.

1309
01:05:10,890 --> 01:05:15,810
We need to stand up and put some sweat 
equity into saving our country,

1310
01:05:16,350 --> 01:05:21,350
but thankfully we don't have to freeze 
and valley forge like our founding 

1311
01:05:21,350 --> 01:05:25,651
fathers in the snow,
waiting to see if we still have a 

1312
01:05:25,651 --> 01:05:28,951
country the next day.
What we can do right now with our 

1313
01:05:28,951 --> 01:05:31,420
activism is come together and get 
together at a coffee shop,

1314
01:05:31,660 --> 01:05:34,960
a sipping our cup of chinos,
meeting likeminded,

1315
01:05:34,990 --> 01:05:39,130
great americans who love America,
who believe in american exceptionalism,

1316
01:05:39,280 --> 01:05:41,350
who believe in safe,
secure border hope,

1317
01:05:41,351 --> 01:05:46,351
believe in having law and order in our 
country who believe in respecting our 

1318
01:05:46,351 --> 01:05:50,761
police,
who believe in honoring our military 

1319
01:05:50,761 --> 01:05:51,410
whole believe in cherishing the memories
and,

1320
01:05:51,411 --> 01:05:52,030
and,
and,

1321
01:05:52,240 --> 01:05:57,160
and acknowledging the freedom that we 
have at the sacrifices that our military

1322
01:05:57,161 --> 01:05:59,470
have paid to give us the freedoms that 
we have today.

1323
01:05:59,800 --> 01:06:04,800
You know,
wHen we visit other countries and you 

1324
01:06:04,800 --> 01:06:07,351
have visited France and you go to 
normandy and you see the graves of 

1325
01:06:07,351 --> 01:06:10,921
americans and normandy,
you sit back and you know that this 

1326
01:06:10,921 --> 01:06:15,580
american brave soldiers left their home 
and went overseas leading their life on 

1327
01:06:16,151 --> 01:06:19,540
the line to fight for freedom and for 
justice.

1328
01:06:19,690 --> 01:06:24,690
And for the american values,
if you don't want to call them 

1329
01:06:24,690 --> 01:06:26,290
judeochristian values,
american values,

1330
01:06:26,650 --> 01:06:30,490
so the rest of the world and experience 
the freedom that we have.

1331
01:06:31,540 --> 01:06:36,540
THe previous generation was willing to 
cross oceans and go die over there to 

1332
01:06:36,540 --> 01:06:41,281
protect the same freedoms that we have 
here at home and give them to other 

1333
01:06:41,281 --> 01:06:44,911
people.
The least we can do is activate here in 

1334
01:06:45,041 --> 01:06:48,460
our home,
in the United States of America and come

1335
01:06:48,461 --> 01:06:53,461
together and stand together and face 
those naysayers and those who slap 

1336
01:06:54,521 --> 01:06:57,580
labels on us,
at least they're not shooting bullets at

1337
01:06:57,581 --> 01:06:58,510
us all day.

1338
01:06:58,520 --> 01:07:03,000
All they're saying is he's a racist or 
she's a racist or she's a white suv.

1339
01:07:03,010 --> 01:07:08,010
Promises,
but we can come together to save our 

1340
01:07:08,010 --> 01:07:08,590
country together.
And that's the beauty.

1341
01:07:08,591 --> 01:07:13,591
It's people like you and I coming 
together and looking into each other's 

1342
01:07:13,591 --> 01:07:16,240
eyes and really being so excited to see 
each other again and read together again

1343
01:07:16,241 --> 01:07:18,430
as americans,
as different as we are,

1344
01:07:18,970 --> 01:07:23,970
but we come together and we love each 
other and respect what each other does 

1345
01:07:23,970 --> 01:07:25,150
to save this country.
And that's what America is all about.

1346
01:07:25,180 --> 01:07:28,870
I encourage people to rise,
rise and defensive,

1347
01:07:28,871 --> 01:07:31,480
judeo christian values and freedom.
get the book,

1348
01:07:31,570 --> 01:07:33,340
read it,
share it with their friends,

1349
01:07:33,460 --> 01:07:35,830
get multiple copies,
put them in public libraries.

1350
01:07:35,831 --> 01:07:40,630
We need to educate and go to act for 
America that own and by the way,

1351
01:07:40,780 --> 01:07:43,540
we named the organization,
act for America,

1352
01:07:43,780 --> 01:07:46,310
not think about America now,
which for America,

1353
01:07:46,480 --> 01:07:48,970
pray for America.
You can do all that,

1354
01:07:49,150 --> 01:07:51,700
but without acting,
nothing happens.

1355
01:07:52,050 --> 01:07:54,240
You are the real deal,
bridgette,

1356
01:07:54,530 --> 01:07:58,620
a friend I love or the racist bigot of 
the day.

1357
01:07:58,621 --> 01:08:01,740
then I will gladly be thrown in that 
bucket with you.

1358
01:08:01,990 --> 01:08:04,950
A use case.
People don't know guys.

1359
01:08:05,370 --> 01:08:10,370
The link to rise is right down below and
buy it and put it in libraries and all 

1360
01:08:10,370 --> 01:08:10,370
that

1361
01:08:12,150 --> 01:08:14,470
more appreciate and you can follow her 
on twitter.

1362
01:08:14,530 --> 01:08:16,060
It's act.
Bridgette.
