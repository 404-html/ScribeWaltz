1
00:00:04,520 --> 00:00:07,460
Joining me today is the original king of
interviewing,

2
00:00:07,461 --> 00:00:08,720
a friend,
a mentor,

3
00:00:08,721 --> 00:00:13,721
a living legend,
and a man who loves a good Brooklyn 

4
00:00:13,721 --> 00:00:14,750
Water Bagel.
Larry King,

5
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:17,560
welcome to the Rubin report.
No one ever I hear legend.

6
00:00:18,260 --> 00:00:21,590
I think one thing old.
Well,

7
00:00:21,620 --> 00:00:23,730
and every time we've sat down,
I always,

8
00:00:23,731 --> 00:00:28,731
I,
I feel that I have to say living legend 

9
00:00:28,731 --> 00:00:28,910
at the beginning because you are.

10
00:00:29,260 --> 00:00:34,260
Tell us.
One of the best compliments I ever got 

11
00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:34,260
was Derek jeter.
Great Yankee.

12
00:00:34,630 --> 00:00:39,630
Now on over the Marlin's came over to me
at the All star game some years ago and 

13
00:00:40,451 --> 00:00:41,230
said,
you.

14
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:44,410
He said there were a lot of phony 
legends.

15
00:00:44,650 --> 00:00:46,390
You're a true lunch.
Wow,

16
00:00:46,850 --> 00:00:47,810
that's pretty good.
Yeah.

17
00:00:47,811 --> 00:00:52,811
That warm my heart and that's coming 
from a legend because that kind of guys 

18
00:00:52,811 --> 00:00:57,110
the true baseball fee too.
Did you ever think that after all your 

19
00:00:57,110 --> 00:01:01,100
years in radio and cable news now doing 
the digital thing,

20
00:01:01,550 --> 00:01:05,090
that you'd be sitting in a garage being 
interviewed like this,

21
00:01:05,091 --> 00:01:07,760
going out to hundreds of thousands and 
millions of people?

22
00:01:07,770 --> 00:01:08,930
Well,
let me tell you the truth.

23
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:15,140
This is the pinnacle of my career.
If you'd have told me 61 years ago when 

24
00:01:16,261 --> 00:01:21,261
I started 61 years from today,
you will be known around the world.

25
00:01:22,620 --> 00:01:24,810
You'll be called an icon,
a living legend,

26
00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:30,890
and at the height of your career you'll 
be in a garage with David Ruben.

27
00:01:33,330 --> 00:01:34,500
It's come full circle.

28
00:01:34,650 --> 00:01:38,250
It's killing me,
Larry David.

29
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:43,280
But what does that,
what does that say about just how 

30
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:43,280
everything has changed?
I mean,

31
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:46,970
the only thing sures change,
the only thing constant is change.

32
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:50,870
When I started in radio,
we had landlines,

33
00:01:51,990 --> 00:01:56,990
a webpro phone line.
I did starting regular,

34
00:01:57,321 --> 00:02:00,340
did local television one year after I 
started audio.

35
00:02:00,350 --> 00:02:04,190
Always did both.
Always regarded both equally.

36
00:02:05,180 --> 00:02:10,180
Uh,
I always thought of television is radio 

37
00:02:10,180 --> 00:02:10,180
with pictures.
We can be on a radio now.

38
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:11,940
Yeah.
Well we released this as an audio file.

39
00:02:11,941 --> 00:02:13,490
I know,
but they don't have to see it.

40
00:02:13,670 --> 00:02:16,520
Yeah,
we could imagine.

41
00:02:16,521 --> 00:02:21,521
And he's radio is theater of the mind,
but I always took it as just 

42
00:02:21,521 --> 00:02:24,630
communicating.
So I started in radio them,

43
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:29,640
did local television,
then did national radio and satellites.

44
00:02:29,751 --> 00:02:31,820
I was there when satellites were 
introduced.

45
00:02:31,821 --> 00:02:34,430
I never forgot it.
I'm in Washington,

46
00:02:34,431 --> 00:02:38,150
the guest is in La and it feels like 
he's right there.

47
00:02:38,210 --> 00:02:40,070
Yeah,
right there.

48
00:02:40,340 --> 00:02:43,100
It was amazing saddle.
I said satellites.

49
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:45,080
That's the end that completes it.

50
00:02:45,090 --> 00:02:49,700
Then Ted Turner hired me through CNN and
I'm seeing around the world.

51
00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:55,220
We go up 23,000
miles to go next door and to Moscow.

52
00:02:56,860 --> 00:03:01,860
Try to explain that to Jefferson doing 
hot and now after 20 years,

53
00:03:03,090 --> 00:03:08,090
almost 26 years at CNN,
61 years in the business I thought I 

54
00:03:08,090 --> 00:03:12,901
could retire.
Follow slim came along so we go do 

55
00:03:12,901 --> 00:03:14,560
something.
So the internet or a TV or Hulu.

56
00:03:14,561 --> 00:03:17,980
Who knew from this and when you tell me 
about the Internet,

57
00:03:18,460 --> 00:03:23,460
what bugs me is when a hill is it?
Where is the Internet and people talk 

58
00:03:23,460 --> 00:03:26,320
about the Internet and I even though I 
just have to accept it,

59
00:03:26,610 --> 00:03:29,140
correct.
I'm a product of all these things,

60
00:03:29,141 --> 00:03:34,141
but basically David,
I am doing exactly what I did 61 years 

61
00:03:34,141 --> 00:03:38,821
ago.
What we're doing right now is no 

62
00:03:38,821 --> 00:03:38,821
different.
Yeah,

63
00:03:38,821 --> 00:03:43,370
we're being delivered differently,
but what we're doing and what does that 

64
00:03:43,691 --> 00:03:44,860
say about this?

65
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:49,480
The ability to sit across from somebody,
look them in the eye and actually try to

66
00:03:49,481 --> 00:03:54,481
understand the human experience because 
I was saying to you in the green room 

67
00:03:54,481 --> 00:03:57,331
right before there is a massive 
renaissance right now because of 

68
00:03:57,331 --> 00:03:59,320
podcasts,
about long form conversation,

69
00:03:59,321 --> 00:04:01,420
the thing that you've been doing for 60,
some ideas,

70
00:04:01,470 --> 00:04:04,070
that's where it's happening and 
podcasts.

71
00:04:05,070 --> 00:04:08,700
It's not happening on television.
Not even on cable toe.

72
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:11,920
They used to call,
you know MSNBC,

73
00:04:11,921 --> 00:04:16,180
CNN and Fox news channels.
They're not new shells.

74
00:04:16,570 --> 00:04:19,060
They have prompt channels.
Is pro trump.

75
00:04:19,630 --> 00:04:24,040
Anti trump won sometimes hate trump and 
there's pundits.

76
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:26,800
Yeah,
it's 24 hours a day of punditry.

77
00:04:27,610 --> 00:04:31,390
They do not cover the news.
When the hurricane was hitting Carolina,

78
00:04:31,690 --> 00:04:35,050
it was in a box on the corner of the 
screen.

79
00:04:35,060 --> 00:04:38,320
While we're talking about trump.
You saw where the hurricane was.

80
00:04:38,730 --> 00:04:43,730
That's not news.
Do you remember seeing a change on that 

81
00:04:43,730 --> 00:04:46,500
because you were at CNN,
you remember what year you started at 

82
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:46,500
the end?

83
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:49,830
I started in 1985 and left in 2010.
Yeah.

84
00:04:50,620 --> 00:04:55,620
Do you remember seeing something 
changing in the way the news reported 

85
00:04:55,620 --> 00:04:57,850
and the sword?
When the other side started?

86
00:04:57,960 --> 00:04:59,800
You know,
we owned it for a while,

87
00:04:59,801 --> 00:05:02,650
CNN,
and then it was MSNBC,

88
00:05:02,651 --> 00:05:03,670
CNN,
Fox,

89
00:05:03,940 --> 00:05:06,700
and we thought they were little 
invaders.

90
00:05:06,730 --> 00:05:08,500
Ted Turner was a genius.
Yeah,

91
00:05:08,650 --> 00:05:11,620
an office pants genius of the seat of 
the pants.

92
00:05:13,210 --> 00:05:15,820
He was driving in a car one day and the 
guy said,

93
00:05:15,821 --> 00:05:17,200
all news all the time.
He said,

94
00:05:17,201 --> 00:05:20,770
why could not work on television?
Then he puts it up on the big bird.

95
00:05:21,460 --> 00:05:26,460
Look what He.
He is the revolutionary leader of the 

96
00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:30,301
second half of the 20th century.
Changes the world and look where it's 

97
00:05:30,301 --> 00:05:31,210
come to now,
the Internet.

98
00:05:31,211 --> 00:05:33,440
Now you're everywhere.
You know the different side.

99
00:05:33,670 --> 00:05:37,690
There's good and bad to it.
If something happened in the world right

100
00:05:37,691 --> 00:05:38,350
now,
David,

101
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:40,180
everyone knows that in a minute.

102
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:42,550
In a minute,
the world knows it.

103
00:05:44,410 --> 00:05:45,690
Wow.
Yeah.

104
00:05:46,150 --> 00:05:51,150
What do we do with this?
Technology is always ahead of the human 

105
00:05:51,150 --> 00:05:52,960
advance,
so when technology's ahead,

106
00:05:53,470 --> 00:05:58,470
it's how do we grasp using this?
It's a great pie interview with Steve 

107
00:05:58,550 --> 00:06:02,810
Jobs when he started apple and I'm 
wondering if he were here today,

108
00:06:03,470 --> 00:06:08,470
if he would know what an impact that's 
had in the world because I've had 

109
00:06:08,900 --> 00:06:13,760
experts told me that your iphone will 
control your life.

110
00:06:14,740 --> 00:06:16,670
Basically.
It's controlling our lives right now.

111
00:06:16,671 --> 00:06:18,830
This is a perfect segway,
my friend.

112
00:06:18,831 --> 00:06:23,831
Can you bust out your phone?
I do not have an iphone because I don't 

113
00:06:23,831 --> 00:06:28,331
want to be.
I was addicted to tobacco from age 17 to

114
00:06:29,211 --> 00:06:33,590
age 53 when I had a heart attack.
I know what addiction is.

115
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:39,640
I would wake up in the morning and 
grabbed the cigarette before I put my 

116
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:39,640
glasses on.
Anything.

117
00:06:40,010 --> 00:06:43,910
I see people,
my wife friends with their cell phones.

118
00:06:45,490 --> 00:06:47,270
I have been with a friend.
I'd never talked to him.

119
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:52,100
We sit at dinner and I mean and he's A.
I think they get from cancer,

120
00:06:53,210 --> 00:06:56,540
so I have old school.
A flip phone.

121
00:06:56,541 --> 00:06:57,710
See his phone?
Yeah.

122
00:06:58,970 --> 00:07:01,730
It's a phone.
Put it to your ear.

123
00:07:02,140 --> 00:07:04,430
You hear the other side?
I don't text.

124
00:07:05,150 --> 00:07:07,010
I hit people.
They call me.

125
00:07:07,011 --> 00:07:12,011
I called them normal.
You're the only person that I actually 

126
00:07:12,011 --> 00:07:16,031
call.
You do realize that I don't call 

127
00:07:16,031 --> 00:07:16,031
anybody.
I just take.

128
00:07:16,031 --> 00:07:18,650
Why don't you.
Why use this hurts me.

129
00:07:19,130 --> 00:07:22,760
You as a broadcaster.
As a communicator?

130
00:07:22,790 --> 00:07:24,740
Yeah.
Why do you text?

131
00:07:25,100 --> 00:07:26,540
All right.
I could see an emergency.

132
00:07:26,541 --> 00:07:28,430
I'm stuck.
I'll be late.

133
00:07:28,590 --> 00:07:33,290
Yeah,
but come on sometimes people will look,

134
00:07:33,470 --> 00:07:34,850
you know,
this is what I love to do,

135
00:07:34,910 --> 00:07:39,910
but sometimes just for the sake of ease 
of just I'm going to be here then or 

136
00:07:40,641 --> 00:07:41,420
I'll see you there.

137
00:07:41,450 --> 00:07:42,110
You know,
a lot of that.

138
00:07:42,111 --> 00:07:46,320
I try not to have long form discussions 
about political will lose or.

139
00:07:46,430 --> 00:07:48,680
But yeah,
people are fighting over personal things

140
00:07:48,681 --> 00:07:50,600
on there and all of that.
But wait,

141
00:07:50,601 --> 00:07:55,601
I want,
I want it back into the thing he said 

142
00:07:55,601 --> 00:07:56,831
before because.
So when the satellite started and then 

143
00:07:56,831 --> 00:07:59,621
you suddenly we're doing interviews with
people where you weren't in the same 

144
00:07:59,621 --> 00:08:02,801
room.
Do you remember that affecting the 

145
00:08:02,801 --> 00:08:02,960
interview in La?
Because I always liked this.

146
00:08:02,961 --> 00:08:06,020
I don't want nothing like that.
Nothing beats this.

147
00:08:06,350 --> 00:08:07,490
Nothing.
However.

148
00:08:08,660 --> 00:08:12,200
I always try to treat it as this.
They just weren't there,

149
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:15,170
so I try to make eye contact via the 
satellite.

150
00:08:16,580 --> 00:08:21,580
I try to treat it as if they were there 
and what I got used to handling well and

151
00:08:21,981 --> 00:08:26,981
enjoyed was when I've had five different
guests in five different places and 

152
00:08:26,981 --> 00:08:28,070
controlling that.
Yeah,

153
00:08:28,370 --> 00:08:33,370
and then I did diplomacy.
I had a night where we had a Arafat 

154
00:08:35,160 --> 00:08:40,160
route being and the king,
the King of Jordan,

155
00:08:42,670 --> 00:08:44,330
King Abdullah,
not Avila,

156
00:08:44,420 --> 00:08:45,620
his father.
Okay.

157
00:08:47,810 --> 00:08:52,810
All three.
Kissinger told me you were doing 

158
00:08:52,810 --> 00:08:55,361
diplomacy.
I had our fat king of Jordan and the 

159
00:08:56,941 --> 00:09:01,941
prime minister of Israel together.
Me a little Jewish kid from Brooklyn 

160
00:09:02,220 --> 00:09:05,250
sitting there by satellite,
but I felt I was with them.

161
00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:10,380
I didn't treat it as them being there.
I treated as like this.

162
00:09:10,470 --> 00:09:10,890
Yeah.

163
00:09:11,150 --> 00:09:16,150
Did you in,
in some of the bigger interviews that 

164
00:09:16,150 --> 00:09:16,150
you did over the years,
I mean,

165
00:09:16,150 --> 00:09:16,730
you've interviewed,
you've truly interviewed everybody.

166
00:09:16,820 --> 00:09:18,500
Is there anyone that you felt like you 
didn't,

167
00:09:18,590 --> 00:09:19,020
you didn't get

168
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:23,000
Castro?
I went down to Cuba in 19,

169
00:09:23,001 --> 00:09:23,750
in 20.
Oh,

170
00:09:23,751 --> 00:09:27,730
nine slash two old nun.
I was treated legally.

171
00:09:27,740 --> 00:09:31,370
They all wonderful to me,
but I couldn't nail it.

172
00:09:31,970 --> 00:09:36,970
Couldn't get them to do.
I was fascinated by him because he led 

173
00:09:36,970 --> 00:09:41,501
his country longer than any leader in 
memory.

174
00:09:44,260 --> 00:09:48,200
Somebody had a like them.
Even if it was only one person,

175
00:09:48,201 --> 00:09:51,110
and then when I went to Havana,
I never saw a happier country.

176
00:09:51,410 --> 00:09:56,410
I was amazed the people smiling,
musical hotels,

177
00:09:56,721 --> 00:09:57,660
mobbed,
you know,

178
00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:01,220
Canadians,
Germans and beautiful weather,

179
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:06,320
Beautiful City Water Havana,
or to be open to everybody.

180
00:10:06,321 --> 00:10:09,170
It's beautiful.
The water's up or just.

181
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:10,760
It's a great city.

182
00:10:11,020 --> 00:10:14,530
How aware were you when you're 
interviewing big timers,

183
00:10:14,531 --> 00:10:18,490
the real movers and shakers that the 
ravines and Arafat's that you mentioned,

184
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:23,530
that something that you ask them could 
actually turn the course of history?

185
00:10:23,970 --> 00:10:24,750
No,
I'm not aware of.

186
00:10:24,780 --> 00:10:29,780
I know a lot of it did.
I know the parole board debate changed 

187
00:10:29,780 --> 00:10:30,830
Nafta.
We Clinton called me up the next day and

188
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:32,360
said,
you pass enough to.

189
00:10:32,970 --> 00:10:36,450
That was way behind until the go pro or 
pro debate.

190
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:41,940
You try not to read,
but once once the light goes on.

191
00:10:43,590 --> 00:10:45,890
That's just a moment.
I'm in Illinois.

192
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:50,960
I if I'm sitting with Jimmy Carter or a 
ballet dancer,

193
00:10:51,900 --> 00:10:55,200
once the light goes on,
I'm in that moment.

194
00:10:55,530 --> 00:10:57,780
I don't think about yesterday.
Can't do anything about it.

195
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:00,720
Don't think about tomorrow.
That's tomorrow.

196
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:05,250
So I'm in the now so I'm right in this 
now.

197
00:11:05,730 --> 00:11:10,730
You should be in this now.
So if you've got trump coming tomorrow 

198
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:14,010
and you're thinking about that,
then you're losing this moment.

199
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:16,490
I'm here.
I always treat.

200
00:11:16,530 --> 00:11:17,030
I'm here.
I,

201
00:11:17,050 --> 00:11:18,270
oh,
I focused.

202
00:11:19,820 --> 00:11:20,760
Do you.

203
00:11:21,460 --> 00:11:26,460
I think that that your curiosity,
do you think you sort of made that for 

204
00:11:26,460 --> 00:11:31,351
yourself or was it built into you?
Because I've been out with you to lunch 

205
00:11:31,351 --> 00:11:31,351
or to dinner,
breakfast,

206
00:11:31,351 --> 00:11:35,461
whatever it is,
and I can see you're as curious about 

207
00:11:35,461 --> 00:11:35,860
the waiter.
Every busboy or sometime when we were at

208
00:11:35,861 --> 00:11:39,550
ora together and you'd be chatting with 
the guy doing the lights or whatever,

209
00:11:39,551 --> 00:11:41,900
that you were actually as interested in 
them as if

210
00:11:44,140 --> 00:11:49,140
David.
I remember as a kid getting on a bus,

211
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:55,560
kip and asking the bus driver,
why do you want to drive a bus?

212
00:11:56,740 --> 00:11:59,730
I remember we'd go to ball games,
kid in Brooklyn,

213
00:11:59,740 --> 00:12:01,810
go to dodger games,
go with my friends.

214
00:12:02,530 --> 00:12:06,010
We'd wait outside for the players.
They wanted autographs.

215
00:12:06,011 --> 00:12:09,040
I never want them in order to grow.
I wanted to ask questions.

216
00:12:09,460 --> 00:12:11,940
I would run along with a player going to
his car.

217
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:13,440
Why did.
Why did you bunt?

218
00:12:13,780 --> 00:12:16,810
Why'd you do that?
I was always a white person.

219
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:20,530
I'm the kind of person you don't want to
sit next to on an airplane.

220
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:22,530
I.
I'm in sand.

221
00:12:22,540 --> 00:12:27,540
I don't know where that came from,
but it's the best gift I got was 

222
00:12:27,540 --> 00:12:29,140
curious.
The gift of curiosity.

223
00:12:29,650 --> 00:12:32,530
Anthony Quinn told me that you have the 
greatest gift ever.

224
00:12:33,130 --> 00:12:36,370
Curiosity,
my friend Herby Cohen.

225
00:12:36,700 --> 00:12:38,800
You can negotiate anything says to me.

226
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:42,220
The secret of my success is being 
stupid.

227
00:12:42,830 --> 00:12:46,420
It doesn't mean that demeaning.
Basically what you're doing is saying,

228
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:50,290
help me.
Help me with this.

229
00:12:51,430 --> 00:12:54,490
Why'd you do that?
Someone asked me a few it interviewed or

230
00:12:54,491 --> 00:12:59,491
some have been loud with your first 
question a bit while it would not have 

231
00:12:59,491 --> 00:13:02,410
been,
why did you bomb the World Trade Center?

232
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:08,640
It would have been you grew up in one of
the richest families in Saudi Arabia.

233
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:16,360
Why don't you leave now?
He probably hadn't bought a lot since he

234
00:13:18,071 --> 00:13:23,071
left,
but it forces you to think and then I'm 

235
00:13:23,071 --> 00:13:28,051
going to learn more about him before I 
learned about the bombing and also you 

236
00:13:28,051 --> 00:13:32,881
have to understand that nobody,
nobody thinks they're evil.

237
00:13:34,030 --> 00:13:36,190
Hitler did not comb his hair in the 
morning and say,

238
00:13:36,191 --> 00:13:39,760
I am a bad person.
They may be crazy,

239
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:45,240
but they believe nobody thinks for 
really terrible and everyone has an 

240
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:46,090
excuse for what they do.

241
00:13:46,540 --> 00:13:48,640
The bankruptcy,
the bank,

242
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:54,480
but my father,
they charged his checking account that 

243
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:57,631
screwed up and the public funding enough
admires the renegade.

244
00:14:00,100 --> 00:14:03,010
Dylan.
Joe was very popular in America.

245
00:14:04,390 --> 00:14:08,530
Very popular.
He robbed from banks who likes banks.

246
00:14:08,590 --> 00:14:12,490
Right?
So how do you then interview a bad dude?

247
00:14:12,491 --> 00:14:15,670
Someone that's got your curious.
You're curious about a bad dude.

248
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,650
I.
I try not to.

249
00:14:17,710 --> 00:14:20,490
It's hard sometimes racists especially.
Yeah,

250
00:14:20,830 --> 00:14:24,520
I had a tough time doing the early 
George Wallace.

251
00:14:24,910 --> 00:14:29,910
The later George Wallace was terrific.
The early George was a tough time 

252
00:14:29,910 --> 00:14:32,170
because I don't understand racism.
I've never understood it,

253
00:14:32,950 --> 00:14:37,950
I don't have no understanding of why 
someone would a different pigment.

254
00:14:39,460 --> 00:14:42,010
That's all it is.
Should be treated differently.

255
00:14:42,070 --> 00:14:44,880
You think that comes from just growing 
up in Brooklyn and it is what?

256
00:14:44,950 --> 00:14:49,950
It was such a medicaid.
Can you just talk about that a little 

257
00:14:49,950 --> 00:14:49,950
bit?
Like what that was like growing up.

258
00:14:49,950 --> 00:14:51,430
Oh,
I grew up in a neighborhood of making,

259
00:14:51,730 --> 00:14:52,720
you know,
Jews,

260
00:14:52,730 --> 00:14:54,170
Protestants,
Catholics,

261
00:14:55,490 --> 00:14:56,670
some,
not a lot,

262
00:14:56,671 --> 00:15:01,671
but blacks went to school at us.
When I went down to Miami to break into 

263
00:15:01,671 --> 00:15:05,680
radio,
I was 23 and I got off the train and the

264
00:15:06,231 --> 00:15:08,960
first thing I saw were two water 
fountains,

265
00:15:09,980 --> 00:15:13,660
colored white.
I drank out of it.

266
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:15,980
Yeah.
I'd never seen anything like that.

267
00:15:16,130 --> 00:15:17,930
You grew up in Brooklyn.
That was beyond me.

268
00:15:18,470 --> 00:15:23,470
Then I got on a bus to go over to Miami 
beach to stay with my uncle and the bus 

269
00:15:23,470 --> 00:15:28,331
drivers stuffs the bus and asked me to 
move forward because the back is for 

270
00:15:28,791 --> 00:15:32,990
blacks and I said to him,
my father's black,

271
00:15:33,770 --> 00:15:35,680
I'll stay in the back.
So I never.

272
00:15:35,681 --> 00:15:38,200
I never understood it and I've asked 
this a racist.

273
00:15:38,310 --> 00:15:43,310
I have never understood why a wife feels
superior to a black.

274
00:15:44,390 --> 00:15:46,250
Lenny Bruce,
who was a great friend of mine,

275
00:15:46,251 --> 00:15:51,251
used to tell me that the human being has
to have something they hate that drives 

276
00:15:52,761 --> 00:15:57,761
them because they have an inferiority 
complex so they have to feel superior or

277
00:15:57,861 --> 00:16:00,530
something,
and he told me 40 years ago,

278
00:16:00,980 --> 00:16:05,600
Sunday blacks will get equal rights and 
we'll have to hate something.

279
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:08,630
I'll tell you what,
we'll hate eskimos.

280
00:16:10,300 --> 00:16:12,050
There's always another right.
In other words,

281
00:16:12,051 --> 00:16:17,051
you know,
used to check into a hotel and 

282
00:16:17,051 --> 00:16:18,020
underneath the chair would be assigned,
remove under penalty of law.

283
00:16:18,250 --> 00:16:21,200
You know,
who removes him Eskimos,

284
00:16:22,460 --> 00:16:23,750
you know,
and he asked for a war.

285
00:16:23,780 --> 00:16:24,930
Heroes.
Yeah.

286
00:16:24,990 --> 00:16:27,150
You don't know name one.
I can't.

287
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:31,500
I'm going to google that.
I've got an Eskimo doctor.

288
00:16:32,870 --> 00:16:37,870
They would look for.
They were just trying to find some and 

289
00:16:37,870 --> 00:16:37,990
racism.
Always be photo.

290
00:16:38,020 --> 00:16:41,870
I interviewed Dean Rusk,
secretary of State Kennedy years,

291
00:16:42,890 --> 00:16:46,070
and he was a very progressive southerner
from Georgia.

292
00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:49,260
His daughter married a black man.
He has.

293
00:16:49,330 --> 00:16:51,470
He said,
I have no prejudice.

294
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:57,160
Seamless.
They taught me a little about prejudice 

295
00:16:57,160 --> 00:16:58,280
of mouth.
The next Dean Rusk said to me,

296
00:16:59,060 --> 00:17:01,430
my daughter married a black man.
I had black grandchild.

297
00:17:02,660 --> 00:17:06,170
I have no prejudice.
I got on a commercial plane.

298
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:11,800
The pilot was black and for a minute I 
was nervous that Sergio how inbred or 

299
00:17:12,810 --> 00:17:17,810
can be can he fly the plane,
but I've never boggles me.

300
00:17:19,740 --> 00:17:22,530
When you win over the years when you've 
talked to some of these people,

301
00:17:22,531 --> 00:17:24,480
you know,
white supremacists or just some of these

302
00:17:24,481 --> 00:17:27,000
people that come from that truly racist 
place,

303
00:17:29,100 --> 00:17:32,700
did you ever hear them say anything?
Was it almost like therapy in a way that

304
00:17:32,701 --> 00:17:34,290
you felt if you talk to them long 
enough,

305
00:17:34,340 --> 00:17:36,150
maybe they could get out of it?
Did you ever.

306
00:17:36,151 --> 00:17:36,450
Since

307
00:17:37,310 --> 00:17:42,310
you try,
you try the best you can now as some 

308
00:17:42,310 --> 00:17:43,830
books out by former white supremacists 
who come full circle.

309
00:17:44,740 --> 00:17:49,740
If,
of course they raised a lot to do with 

310
00:17:49,740 --> 00:17:51,450
raising as the major inferiority.
You got to deal with that.

311
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:54,390
Although someone said it's not a complex
tear inferior.

312
00:17:57,380 --> 00:17:59,340
Who were some of the people that you 
interviewed that,

313
00:17:59,430 --> 00:18:04,430
uh,
that you think either it went the wrong 

314
00:18:04,430 --> 00:18:06,360
way or any regrets and never sitting 
down with somebody to go,

315
00:18:06,361 --> 00:18:08,040
Oh man,
I missed that mall.

316
00:18:08,041 --> 00:18:13,041
I could tell you.
One is the one trying to remember his 

317
00:18:13,041 --> 00:18:16,311
name now.
The guy who succeeded Steve Jobs,

318
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:21,100
they want immediate while Tim Cook now,
but it's not essential.

319
00:18:21,540 --> 00:18:23,610
Yeah.
Steve jobs hired him.

320
00:18:24,750 --> 00:18:25,770
Oh,
what was his name?

321
00:18:25,890 --> 00:18:29,400
Bright Guy came from Pepsi Cola.
I think I'll have my guys google it.

322
00:18:29,401 --> 00:18:30,540
Well,
and he ran,

323
00:18:31,410 --> 00:18:33,990
he ran and I had them on for two hours.
Yeah.

324
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:36,810
Great guest in our fresh.
Why was it?

325
00:18:37,070 --> 00:18:40,680
Why was it was his partner.
Okay.

326
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:41,880
Oh,
this guy,

327
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:45,180
we're play joined the cooperation.
Steve left out.

328
00:18:45,190 --> 00:18:46,560
Then came back later.
Okay,

329
00:18:46,561 --> 00:18:51,561
well we'll grab it.
So I spent two hours interviewing this 

330
00:18:51,561 --> 00:18:51,561
guy.
He was great.

331
00:18:51,561 --> 00:18:56,480
All about previous jobs and,
and then I finished and now I go to 

332
00:18:56,480 --> 00:19:00,591
calls.
I used to do this on my own radio show 

333
00:19:00,591 --> 00:19:00,780
to our interview and our calls in an 
open phone America.

334
00:19:02,130 --> 00:19:03,930
I go to close the first call,
Larry.

335
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:07,470
Steve jobs fired him.

336
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:12,610
He replaced Steve Jobs and steve jobs 
fired him.

337
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:16,920
They didn't even ask about that shit or 
no.

338
00:19:17,350 --> 00:19:19,980
Yeah,
it's tough when one gets by it.

339
00:19:19,990 --> 00:19:22,090
Right,
and it haunts you.

340
00:19:22,091 --> 00:19:24,360
Look at it is years ago is still 
haunting.

341
00:19:24,830 --> 00:19:27,580
You try to know everything.
You can't.

342
00:19:27,620 --> 00:19:30,490
There's no perfectly interview.
You can't know everything.

343
00:19:31,390 --> 00:19:36,390
You do the best shit can.
I had a tough time with child other ran 

344
00:19:38,410 --> 00:19:41,650
because he would remember.
He was talking to me on scully,

345
00:19:41,651 --> 00:19:42,790
I think is the guy.
Does it?

346
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,980
John Sculley?
See we've got a crack team.

347
00:19:44,981 --> 00:19:45,550
Okay,
there you go.

348
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:48,490
He's still around.
By the way.

349
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:55,200
When I interviewed Alma dinner,
John and we're talking about various 

350
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:58,681
things and we're talking about the 
Holocaust and he says to me as well,

351
00:19:59,641 --> 00:20:01,900
I always have to listen when you do an 
interview.

352
00:20:02,830 --> 00:20:04,690
He said,
if there was a holocaust,

353
00:20:05,020 --> 00:20:10,020
why isn't Israel in Poland?
That's where the crime occurred.

354
00:20:11,170 --> 00:20:14,620
Why is the state of Israel 2000 miles 
away?

355
00:20:15,070 --> 00:20:20,070
There was no crime in Palestine.
The crime was in Poland to Germany.

356
00:20:21,100 --> 00:20:23,770
Why didn't they take that area and give 
it to Israel?

357
00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:27,310
Right.
It made some sense.

358
00:20:27,550 --> 00:20:29,900
You could argue with logically.
Yeah.

359
00:20:30,850 --> 00:20:33,620
I said to him,
did you say if there was a whole

360
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:39,190
and we went into just right there.
Are you saying if I,

361
00:20:39,191 --> 00:20:41,390
you know,
when we got contentious,

362
00:20:43,330 --> 00:20:47,350
you deny was.
Those are interesting,

363
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:49,720
but look,
I've had so many years doing this,

364
00:20:49,721 --> 00:20:53,920
Dave and I can't explain how I still 
love it.

365
00:20:54,490 --> 00:20:59,490
I love the interplay.
You should love what you do not know why

366
00:21:01,210 --> 00:21:05,290
you're learning something every day,
every day.

367
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:11,170
So I can't be closed minded like I'm a 
liberal politically,

368
00:21:11,230 --> 00:21:16,230
certainly in social issues,
but I'm not closed minded enough to 

369
00:21:16,230 --> 00:21:18,760
think that you can have an opposing 
view.

370
00:21:20,470 --> 00:21:23,290
I liked the argument,
I liked the discussion,

371
00:21:23,770 --> 00:21:26,950
but in interviewing,
I never leave my ego at the door.

372
00:21:27,700 --> 00:21:32,700
I try not to use the word I to relevant 
and I tried to get into walk in another.

373
00:21:36,540 --> 00:21:38,830
You know Edward Bennett Williams is a 
great lawyer.

374
00:21:38,980 --> 00:21:40,630
Told me once,
I said,

375
00:21:40,631 --> 00:21:43,000
what is the role of the criminal defense
lawyer?

376
00:21:44,470 --> 00:21:49,470
He said to get one person on the jury to
walk in your client's shoes,

377
00:21:50,920 --> 00:21:54,670
if you can get one person to walk in 
your client's shoes,

378
00:21:54,850 --> 00:21:58,570
got a hung jury.
All he has to do is say,

379
00:21:59,470 --> 00:22:01,300
I would have done that.
Yeah.

380
00:22:02,310 --> 00:22:05,050
When you were doing five nights a week 
and on any good.

381
00:22:05,220 --> 00:22:08,970
I use this example a lot because people 
will say,

382
00:22:08,971 --> 00:22:09,870
oh Dave,
you had this,

383
00:22:10,350 --> 00:22:13,110
you know,
this bad person on or this,

384
00:22:13,111 --> 00:22:14,530
that.
The other thing I'll say,

385
00:22:14,531 --> 00:22:15,000
you know,
in,

386
00:22:15,090 --> 00:22:18,810
in Larry King's Hay day,
let's go 1992 CNN.

387
00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:21,150
You'd have the cast of friends on 
Monday,

388
00:22:21,330 --> 00:22:24,330
you'd have an Oj Simpson lawyer.
On Tuesday you'd have,

389
00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:27,560
you know,
an animal guy on Wednesday you'd have,

390
00:22:27,570 --> 00:22:29,190
you know,
a doctor on,

391
00:22:29,191 --> 00:22:32,730
on Thursday and then you know,
former secretary of state on Friday.

392
00:22:34,110 --> 00:22:35,340
Was that crazy for you?

393
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:39,120
You just love the bounce part of my 
curiosity.

394
00:22:39,190 --> 00:22:40,740
Yeah,
most of the Times,

395
00:22:40,770 --> 00:22:44,400
most of the times driving in,
I didn't know I had on that night.

396
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:46,200
Really?
I still don't know Laura.

397
00:22:46,230 --> 00:22:47,580
I drive in.
I don't know who's on.

398
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:53,600
Unless it was really someone famous,
like we might have the animal guy I 

399
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:57,981
didn't know until I walk in and see all 
the animals and because my curiosity 

400
00:22:58,230 --> 00:23:01,200
comes from pure curiosity.

401
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:02,740
So were your guys hand and you know.

402
00:23:03,230 --> 00:23:03,690
No,
no.

403
00:23:03,691 --> 00:23:07,730
I get a blue card.
Like I had a blue card with fax.

404
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:11,000
Yeah.
He was secretary of state from year.

405
00:23:11,020 --> 00:23:16,020
She ended that year.
He was responsible for the Marshall 

406
00:23:16,020 --> 00:23:16,140
Plan.
Right.

407
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:21,320
That's all.
And then I would do the things that are 

408
00:23:21,320 --> 00:23:21,610
the Marshall Plan came about?
Yeah.

409
00:23:22,350 --> 00:23:25,170
How we're part of it.
Did you play with George Marshall?

410
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:27,900
Was his plan?
Were you in on the thinking?

411
00:23:28,620 --> 00:23:32,940
You know,
it's all when when we have the Gulf War,

412
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:38,840
I would see other shows in which the 
guests would come on and be general or 

413
00:23:38,840 --> 00:23:41,580
something and the host would say today 
and the Gulf War,

414
00:23:42,300 --> 00:23:47,300
1000 people were killed and the thing 
and now terrain is here and all I would 

415
00:23:47,300 --> 00:23:51,350
say is what happened?
What happened today?

416
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:56,880
Because he has the perspective.
If you have an interview where you turn 

417
00:23:57,111 --> 00:24:02,030
the TV on and the host is on more than a
guest,

418
00:24:02,120 --> 00:24:04,030
something's wrong.
If you.

419
00:24:04,070 --> 00:24:06,890
If it takes you three sentences to ask a
question,

420
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:10,670
something's wrong,
because a lot of them are show offs.

421
00:24:10,940 --> 00:24:12,880
I'll give you the show off interviewer,
right?

422
00:24:12,910 --> 00:24:17,910
Yeah.
I guess today is Dave Rubin.

423
00:24:18,351 --> 00:24:21,830
He's written a new book called Chicago.
My hometown.

424
00:24:22,740 --> 00:24:23,960
Been great to have you here.
Dave.

425
00:24:23,961 --> 00:24:27,530
You know I visited Chicago many times.
Always loved going there.

426
00:24:27,770 --> 00:24:28,560
Did you,
do you.

427
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:31,360
Do you write about the stock yard,
you know,

428
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:35,350
or stuck study as a fascinating.
Do you ever go to that folks in other.

429
00:24:35,380 --> 00:24:40,380
Otherwise you are a prop for me and 
that's gone now though.

430
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:42,980
There aren't even low shows anymore.
Yeah.

431
00:24:43,250 --> 00:24:45,390
What do you make of.
So when you left at the end,

432
00:24:45,391 --> 00:24:47,720
and I've said this to you before you 
left in 2010,

433
00:24:48,590 --> 00:24:53,590
it seems to me you can do a pretty clean
line between you leaving Sienna and 

434
00:24:53,590 --> 00:24:55,550
obviously the piers Morgan thing didn't 
work out.

435
00:24:55,551 --> 00:24:59,000
If you want to comment on how you can,
but that you were one of the people that

436
00:24:59,001 --> 00:25:03,800
people trusted that there's almost no 
one in news or on television anymore,

437
00:25:03,801 --> 00:25:04,610
that people go,
oh,

438
00:25:04,990 --> 00:25:09,990
like no one was walking around.
Even the people that maybe didn't like 

439
00:25:09,990 --> 00:25:12,341
it that much,
they were going to Larry King's a bad 

440
00:25:12,341 --> 00:25:12,341
dude.
Larry King's a liar.

441
00:25:12,341 --> 00:25:16,061
You know what I mean?
Nobody was doing that by having one of 

442
00:25:16,061 --> 00:25:17,330
the main faces who had been there for so
long.

443
00:25:17,660 --> 00:25:22,100
I really think it broke something in the
continuity of CNN that kind of led us to

444
00:25:22,101 --> 00:25:24,090
where we are now related to all of 
cable.

445
00:25:24,210 --> 00:25:25,340
Maybe.
Maybe it did.

446
00:25:25,430 --> 00:25:26,630
There were signs,
you know,

447
00:25:26,631 --> 00:25:31,631
Fox News was beating us.
We had one at all those years and Fox 

448
00:25:32,150 --> 00:25:35,120
News was beating and beating cnn the 
day,

449
00:25:35,121 --> 00:25:37,680
beating us at night.
That was a sign.

450
00:25:37,690 --> 00:25:39,830
This was a network.
Does Not News,

451
00:25:40,370 --> 00:25:42,160
but am I making this up?
When you left CNN,

452
00:25:42,161 --> 00:25:43,490
you still at the highest rated show

453
00:25:43,830 --> 00:25:46,020
on the second highest week.
We started,

454
00:25:46,021 --> 00:25:46,620
uh,
fall.

455
00:25:46,890 --> 00:25:49,440
Not precipitously,
but we started a fall.

456
00:25:49,500 --> 00:25:54,500
We sort,
we can sort of infancy Saudian was CNN 

457
00:25:54,500 --> 00:25:58,670
always made a ton of money for.
They would have first and everybody in 

458
00:25:58,670 --> 00:26:00,690
America had CNN paid fifty cents a 
month.

459
00:26:00,990 --> 00:26:05,880
So Ted Turner that in on a genius 
thinking this right now,

460
00:26:06,810 --> 00:26:11,010
you and I are paying for CNN.
We're not watching it.

461
00:26:11,820 --> 00:26:15,090
You don't pay for cvs,
you pay him for it.

462
00:26:16,380 --> 00:26:18,960
He knew it.
So cnn made money.

463
00:26:18,961 --> 00:26:21,500
If they had no commercials,
didn't do anything.

464
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:26,600
Just beyond public tune in.
It's a different world now.

465
00:26:27,241 --> 00:26:28,670
I can't,
I don't know,

466
00:26:28,680 --> 00:26:30,990
maybe it was the cleavage,
you know,

467
00:26:32,490 --> 00:26:37,490
Jerry Seinfeld said,
my old column I used to do in usa today 

468
00:26:37,490 --> 00:26:38,070
when I did.
It's my two cents.

469
00:26:38,280 --> 00:26:40,200
That was the beginning of twitter.
Yeah.

470
00:26:40,680 --> 00:26:43,220
Really quick comments.
Uh,

471
00:26:43,690 --> 00:26:44,150
but I,
I,

472
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:45,900
you know,
people call me a pioneer,

473
00:26:45,901 --> 00:26:46,850
so I,
I,

474
00:26:46,851 --> 00:26:51,851
all I see myself is,
I'm a lucky Jewish kid from Brooklyn who

475
00:26:53,191 --> 00:26:58,191
was curious and that curiosity into a 
career as I was able to take the natural

476
00:27:01,711 --> 00:27:04,830
curiosity and make a career of it.

477
00:27:06,510 --> 00:27:08,770
You think we're maybe running out of 
that when you,

478
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:11,130
when you talk to younger than you have 
to be very young sons.

479
00:27:11,131 --> 00:27:13,200
When you talk to young people,
watch how they get the news.

480
00:27:13,201 --> 00:27:16,450
You were telling me about kids with the 
phones and everything and you've.

481
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:18,120
You love the newspaper,
right?

482
00:27:18,121 --> 00:27:18,810
You are mine.

483
00:27:18,950 --> 00:27:21,550
New York Times,
like I got an iphone.

484
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:24,430
They gave me an iphone,
so I use it to get baseball scores.

485
00:27:24,431 --> 00:27:25,030
Yeah,
that's all.

486
00:27:25,230 --> 00:27:28,390
I don't have it with me.
I don't know if the game is tonight.

487
00:27:30,250 --> 00:27:30,940
You Go,
right?

488
00:27:30,941 --> 00:27:31,420
You're.
I mean,

489
00:27:31,421 --> 00:27:33,070
you're a major.
Still a dodger fan.

490
00:27:33,910 --> 00:27:36,190
I love the game.
I go to basketball.

491
00:27:36,191 --> 00:27:38,260
I love the game.
I love competition.

492
00:27:38,290 --> 00:27:40,270
Your gradient at dodger stadium,
right?

493
00:27:40,271 --> 00:27:40,480
Yeah.

494
00:27:40,630 --> 00:27:45,630
I tell you why I love sports.
Sports is the one if you're not a sports

495
00:27:49,691 --> 00:27:50,260
fan.
Oh yeah.

496
00:27:50,440 --> 00:27:51,990
Oh yeah.
Okay.

497
00:27:52,810 --> 00:27:55,030
The best thing about being a sports fan,
it's.

498
00:27:55,040 --> 00:27:57,970
It's the one thing in your life when you
get up in the morning,

499
00:27:58,330 --> 00:28:03,330
you don't know who's going to win,
so you have something to look forward 

500
00:28:03,330 --> 00:28:04,180
to.
Good or bad.

501
00:28:05,080 --> 00:28:07,930
You don't know who's going to win.
Nobody wakes up with that.

502
00:28:08,580 --> 00:28:10,540
Sports fans.
Another thing,

503
00:28:10,541 --> 00:28:15,541
what I love about athletes,
maybe more than any professional,

504
00:28:18,120 --> 00:28:23,120
their career is over when other careers,
the beginning they have that day when 

505
00:28:25,061 --> 00:28:29,050
the cheering stops,
you want that slide.

506
00:28:29,590 --> 00:28:32,110
You build yourself up and you're 37 
years old.

507
00:28:32,560 --> 00:28:37,560
They paid you all this money for doing 
what you did as a kid and another thing 

508
00:28:37,560 --> 00:28:41,971
the athlete has that we don't have final
score can argue that's it.

509
00:28:42,790 --> 00:28:44,380
Eight to seven.
You lost,

510
00:28:44,950 --> 00:28:46,780
you got seven,
they got eight.

511
00:28:46,990 --> 00:28:47,580
You can say,
yeah,

512
00:28:47,581 --> 00:28:51,750
but they should stop.
You got seven Bay guy.

513
00:28:52,330 --> 00:28:56,470
Now if you got eight,
get the applause.

514
00:28:56,830 --> 00:28:58,630
Get the down.
You get that every day.

515
00:29:00,520 --> 00:29:02,410
Recognition.
Nonrecognition.

516
00:29:03,250 --> 00:29:08,250
Walk down the street athletes,
so I love it,

517
00:29:09,410 --> 00:29:13,600
so I love all it brings all my curiosity
sports.

518
00:29:13,601 --> 00:29:16,180
Bring into a head because I'm always 
interested in.

519
00:29:18,100 --> 00:29:22,480
Last night the dodgers lost.
He left a lefthander into picks it.

520
00:29:22,481 --> 00:29:25,090
His right hand buddies got all those 
pitches in the dugout.

521
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:28,990
Why did they men?
Why did they leave him in?

522
00:29:29,330 --> 00:29:34,330
Did you find there was something unique 
about the top of the line athletes that 

523
00:29:34,330 --> 00:29:38,261
you would talk to that they,
that they genuinely had something 

524
00:29:38,261 --> 00:29:38,261
different or they had a guy,
the guys getting at

525
00:29:38,261 --> 00:29:40,090
confidence?
Yeah,

526
00:29:40,150 --> 00:29:45,150
that's it.
Stan musial the grape cardinal outfield 

527
00:29:45,150 --> 00:29:47,260
while he westlake was a teammate of his 
and he,

528
00:29:47,450 --> 00:29:52,450
while he told me this story,
it's the sitting in a dug up before a 

529
00:29:52,450 --> 00:29:54,460
game and Westlake those over to New 
Zealand said,

530
00:29:54,461 --> 00:29:56,650
Stan,
I got up this morning.

531
00:29:56,950 --> 00:30:01,000
Breakfast was great.
The showers great to drive in was great,

532
00:30:01,180 --> 00:30:03,790
and in batting practice I've had five 
whole months.

533
00:30:04,180 --> 00:30:06,680
I feel great.
You haven't had that kind of day,

534
00:30:06,681 --> 00:30:11,681
Stan,
and he said every bit as good as get the

535
00:30:12,011 --> 00:30:16,210
quarterback who throws 10 incomplete 
passes,

536
00:30:17,260 --> 00:30:22,260
never thinks about the 11 to have the 
tenant complete effective confidence.

537
00:30:24,070 --> 00:30:27,910
They have that ability.
You take wide receivers in football,

538
00:30:27,911 --> 00:30:30,490
they're all fast.
They all have good hands.

539
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:33,100
The great one,
the great ones,

540
00:30:33,370 --> 00:30:37,360
they bought me.
It's coming Gretzky.

541
00:30:37,380 --> 00:30:42,380
He told me he saw the puck who into the 
goal before it went into the corner and 

542
00:30:44,730 --> 00:30:46,810
so,
so I have great appreciation.

543
00:30:47,210 --> 00:30:49,540
I also have appreciation for 
politicians.

544
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:55,120
They do something we don't do.
They have a first Tuesday in November.

545
00:30:55,930 --> 00:31:00,930
You know how that day,
they didn't have a first Tuesday in 

546
00:31:00,930 --> 00:31:01,210
November.
They went in lose.

547
00:31:02,610 --> 00:31:05,620
They stand up before the public and they
win or lose.

548
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:10,680
They get rejected.
She kept telling me to satisfy day of 

549
00:31:11,090 --> 00:31:16,090
his life was flying home from his last 
appearance when his advisors told them,

550
00:31:18,070 --> 00:31:19,480
you know,
they know in the afternoon,

551
00:31:19,590 --> 00:31:21,220
yeah,
you're going to lose.

552
00:31:22,060 --> 00:31:27,060
The great story of Barbara Bush told me 
when George Bush loss to Bill Clinton at

553
00:31:28,031 --> 00:31:33,031
3:00
in the afternoon and they knew he was 

554
00:31:33,031 --> 00:31:33,031
going to lose and they're all sitting 
around summer.

555
00:31:33,530 --> 00:31:37,630
Barbara Bush came in and said,
where do we get a driver's license?

556
00:31:39,080 --> 00:31:40,850
All right.
First off,

557
00:31:40,851 --> 00:31:45,851
king,
we just did something that we've never 

558
00:31:45,851 --> 00:31:47,441
done on this.
We stopped for a moment so that Alexis 

559
00:31:47,441 --> 00:31:50,750
could bring you a chocolate shake in the
middle of the show.

560
00:31:51,620 --> 00:31:56,220
Normally someone with diabetes heart 
finish and not have a chocolate Mocha.

561
00:31:56,290 --> 00:32:01,290
However,
I've lost weight and I don't know why 

562
00:32:01,290 --> 00:32:05,560
they say it comes with aging.
I have tried to have a daily milkshake 

563
00:32:05,560 --> 00:32:09,140
to not lose anymore.
That's a call back to Brooklyn,

564
00:32:09,141 --> 00:32:10,370
right?
Oh yeah.

565
00:32:10,371 --> 00:32:15,020
We had malteds to where they put Malt in
the candy store.

566
00:32:15,021 --> 00:32:17,030
There's no candy stores anymore.
There's no camp.

567
00:32:17,060 --> 00:32:22,060
Well now they've got like,
you know Beverly Hills Super Deluxe 

568
00:32:22,060 --> 00:32:26,000
about a candidate and a jukebox and you 
sit in your Greens.

569
00:32:26,001 --> 00:32:27,340
Yeah.
Well,

570
00:32:27,350 --> 00:32:32,350
let's talk a little bit about age.
I guess it's a little weird to talk 

571
00:32:32,350 --> 00:32:32,660
about at some level.
You are 80?

572
00:32:33,520 --> 00:32:35,770
I'll be 85 and November.
Okay.

573
00:32:35,771 --> 00:32:38,570
So can't believe it.
My father died at 46.

574
00:32:39,170 --> 00:32:43,540
I've had every known disease.
I can't believe it.

575
00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:45,530
I can't believe I'm this age.

576
00:32:45,990 --> 00:32:48,110
What is it?
What does it feel like?

577
00:32:48,230 --> 00:32:48,800
I mean,
you've,

578
00:32:48,830 --> 00:32:51,120
you've had a heart attack,
diabetes,

579
00:32:51,121 --> 00:32:52,730
a couple of things and you're still 
here.

580
00:32:52,731 --> 00:32:57,731
You're doing your thing.
You're out and about every morning I 

581
00:32:57,731 --> 00:32:57,731
bump into you.
Half the time

582
00:32:57,990 --> 00:32:58,660
that,
uh,

583
00:32:59,160 --> 00:33:02,850
is the reason I'm around is that I have 
a purpose.

584
00:33:04,140 --> 00:33:09,140
I am amazed that people who retire as 
Milton Berle told me once when I asked 

585
00:33:09,811 --> 00:33:10,740
him,
are you going to retire?

586
00:33:10,741 --> 00:33:15,741
And he said to what?
What would I do if I get up in the 

587
00:33:15,931 --> 00:33:17,310
morning?
I had nothing to do.

588
00:33:17,520 --> 00:33:22,520
That's terrible.
So I have a place to go to follow my 

589
00:33:23,431 --> 00:33:26,340
profession.
That's wonderful.

590
00:33:27,060 --> 00:33:32,060
If you can keep that going,
I'll probably die on the air.

591
00:33:33,390 --> 00:33:36,990
I'll someone asked,
what would you like?

592
00:33:37,110 --> 00:33:39,090
You really want to increase?
My Youtube view is right now.

593
00:33:39,091 --> 00:33:44,091
Came from,
what would you like your obituary to 

594
00:33:44,091 --> 00:33:47,690
read?
And I said the oldest man who ever lived

595
00:33:48,120 --> 00:33:53,120
passed away today and his sleep with a 
smile on his face,

596
00:33:53,220 --> 00:33:54,960
but you still get a kick out of 
everything.

597
00:33:55,280 --> 00:34:00,280
I know it so well.
Just real quick to tell everybody a 

598
00:34:00,280 --> 00:34:00,450
little bit about.
You have these breakfasts with your.

599
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:00,620
Yeah,

600
00:34:01,150 --> 00:34:04,250
well some of them have passed away.
Gosh,

601
00:34:04,251 --> 00:34:09,251
I grew up with in Brooklyn,
but we have a crew of about five or six 

602
00:34:09,251 --> 00:34:12,620
we made every day at different places 
and we attained a to David.

603
00:34:12,621 --> 00:34:14,920
We solve the problems of the world 
today.

604
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:15,850
We solved the wrap.

605
00:34:16,420 --> 00:34:16,730
Yeah.

606
00:34:18,080 --> 00:34:20,240
Audience.
No worries about Iraq.

607
00:34:20,510 --> 00:34:24,890
The table solved mostly through jokes.
The jokes that we talked about,

608
00:34:24,950 --> 00:34:28,130
people getting in arguments,
we talk about Israel,

609
00:34:28,580 --> 00:34:32,110
we talk about hearings,
who's this,

610
00:34:32,120 --> 00:34:33,980
what's this senator doing,
what's he doing?

611
00:34:33,981 --> 00:34:38,981
And then we also discuss Sinatra and old
time musicians and who's doing what and 

612
00:34:40,851 --> 00:34:45,851
what and Barbara streisand make on our 
last tour and so we never know where the

613
00:34:46,371 --> 00:34:49,880
discussion is going and that's the 
wonderful.

614
00:34:49,881 --> 00:34:54,080
And when you going to have friends from 
childhood.

615
00:34:54,660 --> 00:34:57,560
Two of mine have passed away,
but I still have to others.

616
00:34:59,750 --> 00:35:01,160
The best thing about it is

617
00:35:01,250 --> 00:35:06,250
I'm not Larry King and Larry Soccer,
that was my first name and they're very 

618
00:35:07,881 --> 00:35:12,881
happy for me,
but I'm still a button.

619
00:35:13,881 --> 00:35:15,650
Your buttons on your shirt,
you know what I mean?

620
00:35:16,710 --> 00:35:21,710
They,
they don't treat you like anything 

621
00:35:21,710 --> 00:35:23,561
different.
What's it like as somebody of a certain 

622
00:35:23,561 --> 00:35:27,731
age now where you know,
you just mentioned you've lost some 

623
00:35:27,731 --> 00:35:30,700
childhood friends.
Your brother passed away just last year 

624
00:35:30,700 --> 00:35:30,700
or so months ago.
Yeah.

625
00:35:30,700 --> 00:35:33,530
I'm just watching life turn in that way.

626
00:35:34,060 --> 00:35:36,280
That's the sad.
As Sinatra told me once,

627
00:35:36,310 --> 00:35:39,720
the saddest about aging is your friends 
go before you.

628
00:35:41,340 --> 00:35:46,340
I didn't want.
My brother had died before me know your 

629
00:35:46,340 --> 00:35:49,020
younger brother and he was 80.
He was 80.

630
00:35:49,080 --> 00:35:54,080
He lost his hard.
It's because I don't believe in 

631
00:35:54,080 --> 00:35:55,350
afterlife.
I'm not religious.

632
00:35:56,030 --> 00:35:58,650
I think this is a baby.
That's it.

633
00:35:59,070 --> 00:36:01,290
I've never.
I've interviewed thousands of people.

634
00:36:01,291 --> 00:36:03,360
People who said they've seen death and 
all this.

635
00:36:04,860 --> 00:36:07,030
I don't buy it.
Maybe a little.

636
00:36:07,080 --> 00:36:08,310
I don't buy it.
I just.

637
00:36:10,170 --> 00:36:15,170
It just makes no sense to me that 
Lincoln is up there or that there's 

638
00:36:15,630 --> 00:36:20,630
someone up there looking down on me.
I went to my grandchildren's.

639
00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:22,860
They're twins,
boy and a girl.

640
00:36:22,861 --> 00:36:27,690
So they had a bot and a bar Mitzvah,
and for the first time in ages,

641
00:36:27,691 --> 00:36:32,691
I read from the Old Testament that God,
he's the son of a bitch cheese.

642
00:36:35,820 --> 00:36:37,120
Did he hate it?
A lot.

643
00:36:37,230 --> 00:36:40,230
My Enemies.
Lou out the show me one good pen.

644
00:36:40,380 --> 00:36:42,300
My God,
believe in me.

645
00:36:42,301 --> 00:36:43,870
Above me.
He was vain.

646
00:36:45,670 --> 00:36:48,480
Incredible.
He was a Donald Trump before there was a

647
00:36:48,481 --> 00:36:51,230
Donald Trump believe in me.
Above all others.

648
00:36:51,270 --> 00:36:54,570
I am the.
I can't believe so when I read that,

649
00:36:56,920 --> 00:37:00,720
I couldn't believe so I can't buy it.
I've interviewed all the great religious

650
00:37:00,721 --> 00:37:04,080
leaders except pope.
I've never been convinced.

651
00:37:04,081 --> 00:37:05,490
So when you,
when you've sat down,

652
00:37:05,550 --> 00:37:10,550
I sat down with everybody from the Dalai
Lama across the board with Bray Graham 

653
00:37:10,550 --> 00:37:11,120
was a friend.
Yeah.

654
00:37:11,190 --> 00:37:13,380
So when you sat down with them,
even if you don't believe it,

655
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:18,440
did you feel that some of them were able
to get something out of belief?

656
00:37:20,220 --> 00:37:21,900
I believe they believe.
Yeah.

657
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:24,380
Unless there was some nice,
you know,

658
00:37:24,381 --> 00:37:28,530
send in $10 and I'll send you a little 
cross gonna buy any of that.

659
00:37:29,960 --> 00:37:32,960
Sat Down with some of those guys.
Do Jerry Falwell since,

660
00:37:33,170 --> 00:37:35,820
as George Burns once said,
when he played God,

661
00:37:36,770 --> 00:37:38,010
it's a great movie,
great movie,

662
00:37:38,030 --> 00:37:43,030
Great.
And he got us all the religious leaders 

663
00:37:43,030 --> 00:37:45,300
and he calls into Jerry Falwell type and
fall type.

664
00:37:45,301 --> 00:37:46,440
Go See.
Call me in.

665
00:37:46,441 --> 00:37:51,441
First goes up to his room,
sits down and God says to him,

666
00:37:52,590 --> 00:37:54,000
why don't you sold shoes?

667
00:37:56,310 --> 00:37:58,190
So I never,
I never bought that part,

668
00:37:58,380 --> 00:38:00,320
but I,
I liked billy Graham respected,

669
00:38:00,321 --> 00:38:00,950
um,
billy grand,

670
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:05,960
thought I was very spiritual.
And do I believe billy is with Jesus 

671
00:38:05,960 --> 00:38:06,430
now?
No.

672
00:38:07,230 --> 00:38:12,230
But bill,
he believed he believed he was going to 

673
00:38:12,230 --> 00:38:12,230
Jesus.
He had no fear.

674
00:38:12,230 --> 00:38:16,080
Death had a fear of being in a plane 
that's gone down to crash,

675
00:38:17,340 --> 00:38:21,030
but he didn't fear death.
I feared I like Woody Allen.

676
00:38:21,340 --> 00:38:23,040
I don't fear it.
I just don't want to be there.

677
00:38:25,590 --> 00:38:29,830
I can't believe my wife believes.
I respect believers.

678
00:38:29,831 --> 00:38:34,831
See,
when I approach an interview with Billy 

679
00:38:34,831 --> 00:38:34,831
Graham,
I respect him.

680
00:38:34,831 --> 00:38:37,090
I asked him best questions I could ask 
like,

681
00:38:37,720 --> 00:38:39,850
why do you need to stay at the 
Fontainebleau?

682
00:38:41,110 --> 00:38:43,180
Or I've quoted Lenny.
Bruce Timm.

683
00:38:43,420 --> 00:38:48,420
Any person who's got a calling from the 
Lord to lead the flock who has more than

684
00:38:51,041 --> 00:38:55,120
one suit while someone has no clothes,
is a cop out.

685
00:38:57,340 --> 00:39:00,670
And Billy Graham said,
in today's world,

686
00:39:00,910 --> 00:39:04,870
you have to have more than one suit.
You have to travel.

687
00:39:04,990 --> 00:39:09,160
I asked him if Christ Jesus probably had
one pair of flip flops,

688
00:39:09,330 --> 00:39:12,280
crease would Christ,
will he buy suits?

689
00:39:12,281 --> 00:39:14,530
And he said yes.
And he would go on television.

690
00:39:15,820 --> 00:39:17,740
That was a means of communication.
Yeah,

691
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:20,530
I mean that's their answer,
but he believed it.

692
00:39:21,100 --> 00:39:26,100
I respected his belief,
but I'm not afraid to ask them any 

693
00:39:26,100 --> 00:39:29,680
question if when you die,
if you believe in Jesus Christ,

694
00:39:29,681 --> 00:39:32,290
you will live forever.
What happens to the Jews?

695
00:39:35,740 --> 00:39:36,450
And he said,
well,

696
00:39:36,451 --> 00:39:38,170
I,
I don't go into them,

697
00:39:38,171 --> 00:39:41,140
but maybe at the moment of their death 
they accept Christ.

698
00:39:42,570 --> 00:39:45,540
That's kind of a cop out.
There's always sort of another answer.

699
00:39:46,440 --> 00:39:49,290
Did you ever talk to anybody,
either religious or otherwise,

700
00:39:49,291 --> 00:39:52,660
that you felt had some sort of special 
insight into some of the.

701
00:39:53,100 --> 00:39:55,980
Does Dr Ron,
who was convinced that he had died,

702
00:39:56,010 --> 00:39:59,580
visited what the world of afterlife was,
and then his life was saved.

703
00:39:59,581 --> 00:40:03,330
He was recognized.
Dr You know what disease he had.

704
00:40:04,390 --> 00:40:08,700
I threw it up to a vivid imagination and
ain't got a best selling book out of it.

705
00:40:09,870 --> 00:40:12,270
People want to believe,
you know,

706
00:40:12,360 --> 00:40:16,890
I wished that I had faith that I could 
make.

707
00:40:16,920 --> 00:40:19,710
It's called a leap.
Faith can't prove it,

708
00:40:20,820 --> 00:40:24,720
so it's a leap of faith.
Now we have faith in a lot of things.

709
00:40:25,110 --> 00:40:30,110
You get on an airplane,
you have the faith that that airplane 

710
00:40:30,110 --> 00:40:33,730
company hired a licensed pilot.
I punch you.

711
00:40:33,900 --> 00:40:38,900
Have some core belief that you think if 
you jump out of the 10th floor of a 

712
00:40:39,541 --> 00:40:42,570
building,
you're not going to make it so you don't

713
00:40:42,690 --> 00:40:47,690
trump the people who have that faith who
go beyond.

714
00:40:50,290 --> 00:40:55,290
I just think they've got a great crutch,
Greg Crutch to know you're going 

715
00:40:56,881 --> 00:40:57,670
somewhere.
Yeah.

716
00:40:57,671 --> 00:40:57,790
Yeah.

717
00:40:58,300 --> 00:40:59,980
But at the end,
do you think it matters if they,

718
00:40:59,981 --> 00:41:02,050
if they live a good life and you live a 
good life?

719
00:41:02,051 --> 00:41:03,340
First of all,
I've never gotten to know.

720
00:41:03,400 --> 00:41:05,740
Yeah.
If they go somewhere they were right.

721
00:41:05,980 --> 00:41:07,870
If they don't,
they don't know because they did,

722
00:41:08,290 --> 00:41:11,830
so they got a good deal going.
They really have a good deal.

723
00:41:11,860 --> 00:41:14,240
I don't have an RBC.
If I've got an afterlife,

724
00:41:14,280 --> 00:41:16,840
I'll be shocked.
But you'll be doing this.

725
00:41:17,500 --> 00:41:19,780
Oh,
I was absolute.

726
00:41:19,960 --> 00:41:22,180
Or maybe you'll be playing baseball up 
there.

727
00:41:22,210 --> 00:41:25,180
I'm not that good decade.
Um,

728
00:41:25,240 --> 00:41:28,810
let's talk a little bit about politics.
You mentioned trump.

729
00:41:28,811 --> 00:41:31,270
We did about 40 minutes.
His name didn't even come up once.

730
00:41:31,290 --> 00:41:34,230
First Time in American conversation,
any

731
00:41:34,250 --> 00:41:39,250
two people had a conversation for 40 
minutes in the name trump that that's 

732
00:41:39,250 --> 00:41:43,661
one thing he's done.
I'll bet you everyone in America at one 

733
00:41:44,571 --> 00:41:47,930
time today said the name trump.
Everybody.

734
00:41:48,170 --> 00:41:53,170
Everybody.
Is there anyone else that in the years 

735
00:41:53,170 --> 00:41:53,170
that you've been doing this that you 
saw?

736
00:41:53,170 --> 00:41:57,941
Just that effect?
He's the only president that I've known 

737
00:41:57,941 --> 00:42:01,511
for 40 years.
I met the other presidents some before 

738
00:42:01,511 --> 00:42:05,600
they became President Barack Obama,
George Bush,

739
00:42:05,601 --> 00:42:07,910
Bill Clinton.
But they were in the political sphere,

740
00:42:09,620 --> 00:42:14,620
but trump is the only one that was my 
friend before trump and I went to the 

741
00:42:14,620 --> 00:42:19,061
superbowl together.
Can you talk about what I will fathers 

742
00:42:19,061 --> 00:42:19,820
of the year together?
Is that a 1995?

743
00:42:19,821 --> 00:42:22,430
He had his kids and my kids as all of 
his story.

744
00:42:22,431 --> 00:42:25,140
We got trophies.
Um,

745
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:30,760
I went to see Marla maples in her 
Broadway show.

746
00:42:30,861 --> 00:42:35,780
I went with trump.
I stayed at hotels when I had some minor

747
00:42:35,781 --> 00:42:36,860
surgery in New York.

748
00:42:36,860 --> 00:42:39,050
He took my wife out to dinner the night 
before.

749
00:42:39,051 --> 00:42:44,051
He caught me at every hotel he owned,
put me in a suite at the plaza when he 

750
00:42:44,051 --> 00:42:47,621
owned the plaza.
But one thing we always knew about 

751
00:42:47,621 --> 00:42:48,170
trump,
he was a character and he lied.

752
00:42:48,410 --> 00:42:50,330
Now he,
he almost lined by,

753
00:42:50,331 --> 00:42:53,060
it's snowing out when it wasn't,
you know,

754
00:42:53,061 --> 00:42:57,980
he'd be on my show and say highest 
rating and it was all about him,

755
00:42:58,160 --> 00:43:03,160
but he was a character and it was fun 
and he could be very nice and generous.

756
00:43:03,380 --> 00:43:05,060
Okay.
I had all those qualities,

757
00:43:05,180 --> 00:43:06,650
but he was a character.
I mean,

758
00:43:06,651 --> 00:43:11,651
he would call up the New York Post with 
a different name and tell them stories 

759
00:43:11,781 --> 00:43:14,210
about Donald Trump so we can get on page
six.

760
00:43:14,360 --> 00:43:19,360
That was his goal,
but precedent precedent.

761
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:21,680
Are you kidding?
Anybody,

762
00:43:21,681 --> 00:43:24,080
any of us who knew him years ago?
First,

763
00:43:24,410 --> 00:43:29,410
he was a moderate to central Democrat,
supported Hillary Clinton,

764
00:43:30,300 --> 00:43:33,830
loved Hillary Clinton,
thought she was a great senator.

765
00:43:34,970 --> 00:43:39,380
He wanted single payer health care.
He didn't care about abortion.

766
00:43:40,040 --> 00:43:42,530
Come on.
Evangelicals.

767
00:43:44,110 --> 00:43:47,620
I don't think Donald ever read a book,
but he's.

768
00:43:47,660 --> 00:43:51,380
But he was a friendly character to be 
around our wonderful guest.

769
00:43:51,920 --> 00:43:53,960
A lot of fun.
Fly off the top,

770
00:43:54,440 --> 00:43:59,440
but precedent precedent.
So what do you make about what happened 

771
00:43:59,440 --> 00:44:01,880
here?
Like I have no idea what Hillary was.

772
00:44:01,881 --> 00:44:03,530
A bad candidate,
a wonderful person.

773
00:44:03,531 --> 00:44:06,130
I Know Hillary very well.
Great sense of humor.

774
00:44:06,170 --> 00:44:07,270
Said,
I don't know what her.

775
00:44:07,280 --> 00:44:12,280
She didn't go to Wisconsin.
You get a different hillary when you 

776
00:44:12,441 --> 00:44:14,600
went into her interview.
Her publicly.

777
00:44:14,630 --> 00:44:18,040
This is what a lot of her is that she's 
very friendly and open.

778
00:44:18,041 --> 00:44:19,400
The one on one.
She's good.

779
00:44:19,550 --> 00:44:20,900
Yeah.
Front of an audience.

780
00:44:20,901 --> 00:44:22,530
She's not.
She's not a good.

781
00:44:23,360 --> 00:44:28,360
She's running for something now.
I went to a Yom Kippur service where she

782
00:44:28,611 --> 00:44:29,330
was the speaker.

783
00:44:29,330 --> 00:44:31,260
She was terrific.
She wasn't running for anything.

784
00:44:31,830 --> 00:44:34,140
She was a senator from New York and damn
good center,

785
00:44:34,880 --> 00:44:39,880
uh,
she ran a horrendous campaign and she 

786
00:44:39,880 --> 00:44:42,540
was not a good campaign.
I thought she won the debates,

787
00:44:43,320 --> 00:44:48,320
but it almost didn't matter.
Trump became with some got elected with 

788
00:44:48,361 --> 00:44:53,361
that first question in the first 
republican debate when he was asked 

789
00:44:53,361 --> 00:44:55,470
about women and did he ever call women 
pigs?

790
00:44:55,471 --> 00:45:00,471
And he said only Rosie O'donnell.
And he sat in the middle of all the 

791
00:45:00,471 --> 00:45:01,650
Republican.
Why did they see them in the middle?

792
00:45:02,150 --> 00:45:07,150
It was just four on one side.
Did you really think at the end from 

793
00:45:07,150 --> 00:45:09,300
that moment that he thought he would 
ignite something?

794
00:45:09,301 --> 00:45:12,960
But I thought he was dead when he said 
the thing about mccain isn't a hero.

795
00:45:13,440 --> 00:45:17,370
Certainly when he got off the bus with 
billy Bush,

796
00:45:17,730 --> 00:45:22,730
I thought that was over.
But his base doesn't care if 

797
00:45:22,730 --> 00:45:26,451
evangelicals can put aside his personal 
life.

798
00:45:28,620 --> 00:45:33,460
He'll never lose them.
He'll never saw it.

799
00:45:33,840 --> 00:45:36,480
I've never lived in weird at times.
I mean,

800
00:45:36,481 --> 00:45:40,640
this is the weirdest time to every day.
Yeah.

801
00:45:40,770 --> 00:45:41,480
There's a story.

802
00:45:41,540 --> 00:45:42,920
Does this truly,
in all your years,

803
00:45:42,921 --> 00:45:46,070
does this right now feel like a truly,
truly unique time?

804
00:45:46,071 --> 00:45:48,230
Because people ask me that a of the 
events.

805
00:45:48,231 --> 00:45:49,820
I do,
and I think the answer is yes.

806
00:45:49,821 --> 00:45:51,710
Although you always think that when 
you're living it,

807
00:45:52,110 --> 00:45:53,490
of course,
it's your perspective.

808
00:45:53,491 --> 00:45:58,491
Do you believe that?
Somebody said one day to see what 

809
00:45:58,491 --> 00:46:01,150
Lincoln Center.
To hear what?

810
00:46:01,170 --> 00:46:05,550
Roseville dig less night to see the 
speech.

811
00:46:06,300 --> 00:46:09,000
The Carter mate that he went.
Was that weird?

812
00:46:09,510 --> 00:46:12,660
No,
they didn't do weird things.

813
00:46:13,230 --> 00:46:18,230
They were president that I remember.
I was in the White House interviewing 

814
00:46:18,230 --> 00:46:22,341
George Bush and Barbara Bush said to me,
Larry suspenders and the White House,

815
00:46:23,260 --> 00:46:28,260
no,
she was at the White House's place is 

816
00:46:28,260 --> 00:46:31,761
now.
I wonder what it's like in their 

817
00:46:31,761 --> 00:46:34,730
character.
The guy writes the op Ed piece in the 

818
00:46:34,730 --> 00:46:34,730
New York Times.
My God,

819
00:46:34,800 --> 00:46:39,630
the world would book fascinating book.
We're living in those times.

820
00:46:39,720 --> 00:46:40,740
What would it?
Couldn't believe it,

821
00:46:41,610 --> 00:46:46,610
but I can see as you talk about it,
there's a glimmer in your eye like 

822
00:46:46,610 --> 00:46:49,521
there's something exciting about this.
Do you think that that's in a weird way 

823
00:46:49,521 --> 00:46:51,600
the the good part of this,
even if it's kind of helter skelter now.

824
00:46:51,601 --> 00:46:51,690
Okay.

825
00:46:51,780 --> 00:46:53,430
I'm glad I'm not on CNN.
No,

826
00:46:53,910 --> 00:46:57,420
I wouldn't want to be doing panels 
everyday and trump all the time.

827
00:46:58,370 --> 00:47:00,720
Don't want to do that.
That's not the whole world.

828
00:47:00,721 --> 00:47:03,110
Trump's not the whole world.
He thinks he's still

829
00:47:04,140 --> 00:47:09,140
important.
Do you think politics actually is 

830
00:47:09,140 --> 00:47:09,840
because I think now there's maybe what 
I'm realizing now is that this is really

831
00:47:09,841 --> 00:47:12,030
about culture.
What we're fighting right now,

832
00:47:12,031 --> 00:47:17,031
this,
this battle that seems to be in points 

833
00:47:17,031 --> 00:47:17,031
about culture.
It's about what do we really care about?

834
00:47:17,031 --> 00:47:20,601
What do we like?
Not just about the INS and outs and 

835
00:47:20,601 --> 00:47:20,601
machinations of

836
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:26,900
too much of America is still prejudiced 
against Latinos.

837
00:47:26,960 --> 00:47:31,210
Blacks.
That still runs through a lot of this,

838
00:47:31,270 --> 00:47:36,270
in my opinion,
people voting against their own self 

839
00:47:36,270 --> 00:47:40,150
interest.
Now let's face it,

840
00:47:40,151 --> 00:47:45,151
with some.
Obamacare is working for a lot of 

841
00:47:45,151 --> 00:47:49,681
people.
Don't hear many complaints about people 

842
00:47:49,681 --> 00:47:51,100
who are under it and getting good 
medical care.

843
00:47:52,810 --> 00:47:54,620
I'm not sure that I love to do away with
it.

844
00:47:56,050 --> 00:47:59,500
It was just those.
Those kinds of facts are sort of bothers

845
00:47:59,501 --> 00:48:04,501
me when I see that.
Why we still have prejudice in America 

846
00:48:05,081 --> 00:48:07,450
and appeal to it.
I mean,

847
00:48:07,510 --> 00:48:12,510
trump,
even his defendant would say he appeals 

848
00:48:12,510 --> 00:48:13,450
to it.
What do we need a.

849
00:48:13,480 --> 00:48:15,040
We need a wall.
Do you think?

850
00:48:15,041 --> 00:48:16,480
Do you think that's a play by him?
I mean,

851
00:48:16,481 --> 00:48:19,330
for all the years that you knew him,
did you think he was racist or that this

852
00:48:19,331 --> 00:48:20,950
is.
I never thought he was racist.

853
00:48:21,070 --> 00:48:23,950
I think he was opportunities.
He was.

854
00:48:24,700 --> 00:48:29,700
He took advantage of a situation,
so we used to say he wasn't smart.

855
00:48:31,300 --> 00:48:36,300
He wasn't book smart.
I bet at at school he got gentlemen see 

856
00:48:39,490 --> 00:48:44,490
the big influences in his life or Roy 
Cohn who I knew very well and his 

857
00:48:45,401 --> 00:48:49,330
father,
they were bad influences.

858
00:48:50,200 --> 00:48:51,520
I mean,
Rog Roy Cohn was,

859
00:48:51,960 --> 00:48:54,070
I liked them closing.
He was peculiar,

860
00:48:54,550 --> 00:48:56,810
but he was waiting for the people that 
don't know who right going is.

861
00:48:56,950 --> 00:49:01,950
He was a bad guy.
He was part of the mccarthy era and 

862
00:49:02,020 --> 00:49:05,890
angels in America had,
he played a part in that play,

863
00:49:07,690 --> 00:49:11,140
uh,
and he was affected by that.

864
00:49:11,200 --> 00:49:13,480
So I never,
I never thought he was a racist,

865
00:49:14,050 --> 00:49:19,050
but his narcissism was beyond belief.
I in every other sentence,

866
00:49:22,390 --> 00:49:23,740
I did this,
I did that.

867
00:49:23,780 --> 00:49:26,500
I'm the greatest president we've ever 
had.

868
00:49:29,390 --> 00:49:30,270
I think.
Just say that.

869
00:49:31,350 --> 00:49:35,550
How could you say that?
So if you were sitting down with him,

870
00:49:36,300 --> 00:49:37,650
I would say Donald,
why?

871
00:49:38,130 --> 00:49:40,170
I spoke to them everyday during the 
camp,

872
00:49:40,171 --> 00:49:42,240
but not every day,
once a week during the campaign,

873
00:49:42,630 --> 00:49:47,630
he knew I was voting for Hillary,
but we were friends and he would call 

874
00:49:47,630 --> 00:49:47,630
me.
What do you think it is?

875
00:49:47,630 --> 00:49:48,630
I'm the one that is.
What do you think of that?

876
00:49:49,560 --> 00:49:50,640
I got this.
What do you think?

877
00:49:50,641 --> 00:49:55,641
It is something.
I'm going to do an interview with the 

878
00:49:55,641 --> 00:49:55,641
New York Times,
you know,

879
00:49:55,641 --> 00:49:55,641
the guy,
should I do this?

880
00:49:57,990 --> 00:50:00,240
And then when he was elected,
I never heard from him again.

881
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:08,000
I want to.
Do you think we can get out of this 

882
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:11,961
polarization that we seem to be in?
So if we're in this unique time right 

883
00:50:11,961 --> 00:50:12,390
now in crazy time,
how's it going to change?

884
00:50:12,570 --> 00:50:15,330
You know,
we don't have,

885
00:50:20,070 --> 00:50:21,030
uh,
forcefully to.

886
00:50:21,031 --> 00:50:26,031
It might be Bloomberg to lead us.
We need someone

887
00:50:29,630 --> 00:50:31,400
to lead us out.
We need Gary Cooper.

888
00:50:32,300 --> 00:50:35,450
Maybe George Clooney in the modern 
society.

889
00:50:35,451 --> 00:50:40,451
I'm not kidding.
George Clooney a bright and he is 

890
00:50:40,451 --> 00:50:43,930
bright.
George Clooney wouldn't be very pumping 

891
00:50:43,930 --> 00:50:48,070
women's vote smart as a whip.
What does that tell you though?

892
00:50:49,231 --> 00:50:51,000
If we need to go to celebrities?
Do you think?

893
00:50:51,001 --> 00:50:53,270
Maybe we're just in.
There it is.

894
00:50:54,100 --> 00:50:57,400
That's the Internet.
That's the world we live in.

895
00:50:58,860 --> 00:50:59,910
Yeah.
Yeah.

896
00:51:00,610 --> 00:51:02,800
I like Georgia.
I'd vote for him.

897
00:51:03,040 --> 00:51:04,850
Yeah.
But do you think we can get out of this,

898
00:51:05,130 --> 00:51:05,800
this thing?

899
00:51:05,820 --> 00:51:10,820
Well,
they say a motorcycle always comes 

900
00:51:10,820 --> 00:51:11,430
through everything.
George will,

901
00:51:11,431 --> 00:51:16,431
who's become very anti.
Trump believes we can find a way again,

902
00:51:16,831 --> 00:51:21,480
America as a way of finding a way.
I hope so.

903
00:51:21,481 --> 00:51:23,600
I hope I'm around to see it.
Um,

904
00:51:25,970 --> 00:51:27,410
but right now,
and you know,

905
00:51:27,450 --> 00:51:32,160
one in my early,
I can name every senator 10,

906
00:51:32,250 --> 00:51:33,180
10,
20 years ago,

907
00:51:33,240 --> 00:51:37,920
every sound and go orrin hatch and Ted 
Kennedy were great friends,

908
00:51:37,921 --> 00:51:42,921
sponsored bills together.
Hatch did his eulogy that,

909
00:51:43,670 --> 00:51:47,400
that wouldn't exist today.
Today.

910
00:51:47,401 --> 00:51:52,401
The thing is so bad when Obama nominated
his guy for the Supreme Court and I 

911
00:51:53,281 --> 00:51:54,390
shouldn't forget his name

912
00:51:54,830 --> 00:51:59,120
and they never brought it up.
Now of course it's a mic.

913
00:52:00,060 --> 00:52:01,040
We'll get it,
we'll get it.

914
00:52:01,250 --> 00:52:02,040
But not when,
when,

915
00:52:02,110 --> 00:52:02,600
when,
when,

916
00:52:02,620 --> 00:52:07,430
when we nominate people like that who 
was pretty much middle of the road.

917
00:52:08,050 --> 00:52:08,780
Oh,
garland.

918
00:52:08,960 --> 00:52:10,190
Merrick garland.
Merrick garland.

919
00:52:10,191 --> 00:52:15,191
Yeah.
If I would have Democrats now and they 

920
00:52:15,191 --> 00:52:18,941
take the Senate,
I would hold up any appointment until 

921
00:52:18,941 --> 00:52:21,380
they can have a precedent.
And a first person out of point would be

922
00:52:21,381 --> 00:52:24,110
married,
called who deserved to be on that court.

923
00:52:24,470 --> 00:52:29,470
Yeah.
So this is just both of them playing 

924
00:52:29,470 --> 00:52:29,470
politics to Dan.

925
00:52:29,470 --> 00:52:29,690
We have a chance.
I,

926
00:52:32,240 --> 00:52:33,730
I don't see it coming.
You know,

927
00:52:33,850 --> 00:52:37,040
when Merrick Garland was nominated,
for example,

928
00:52:37,041 --> 00:52:39,260
Orrin Hatch,
before he knew they would delay it,

929
00:52:39,261 --> 00:52:44,261
said he's a great man.
And then it becomes party over country,

930
00:52:48,560 --> 00:52:52,550
party over country.
Sad when you think it's going to change.

931
00:52:53,390 --> 00:52:57,200
I think that the outrage machine that 
we're running on right now,

932
00:52:57,201 --> 00:53:00,310
I think it can only last for so long,
so I think it couldn't.

933
00:53:00,800 --> 00:53:05,800
It'll either blow up into something much
worse and I don't even know what I mean 

934
00:53:05,800 --> 00:53:09,401
by that,
but I think things would actually get 

935
00:53:09,401 --> 00:53:11,231
much worse and some of this would 
actually spill over into violence or 

936
00:53:11,231 --> 00:53:14,951
what my hope is,
and I think this is more a realistic 

937
00:53:14,951 --> 00:53:19,511
option,
is that the outrage will start running 

938
00:53:19,511 --> 00:53:22,601
out of steam,
like a car running out of gas and that 

939
00:53:22,601 --> 00:53:24,971
from that somebody,
whether maybe if you're a clooney or 

940
00:53:24,971 --> 00:53:26,850
whoever else,
it is just a decent human being,

941
00:53:27,090 --> 00:53:32,090
a Bloomberg or something else will come 
back and decency will be appreciated 

942
00:53:32,090 --> 00:53:33,660
because I don't think this outreach 
thing can run forever.

943
00:53:33,661 --> 00:53:35,610
It's too.
It's too mentally exhausting.

944
00:53:35,611 --> 00:53:36,780
It's too.
It's physically

945
00:53:37,030 --> 00:53:39,890
was a decent man.
I've known for years with Joe Barton.

946
00:53:40,970 --> 00:53:43,960
Nobody just like some wonderful father 
and a third.

947
00:53:43,970 --> 00:53:48,350
It's a great senator,
a great vice president.

948
00:53:50,510 --> 00:53:53,840
If he were a little younger,
can you imagine he'd be,

949
00:53:53,841 --> 00:53:54,910
what?
80 two or something?

950
00:53:54,911 --> 00:53:56,450
Yeah,
because she can't dislike them.

951
00:53:56,480 --> 00:53:58,490
You want to be vp?
No,

952
00:53:58,970 --> 00:54:00,380
I couldn't take the cut in pay.

953
00:54:02,970 --> 00:54:03,610
All right.
Let's,

954
00:54:03,670 --> 00:54:05,980
let's finish up with some,
some big picture,

955
00:54:06,220 --> 00:54:09,040
big picture stuff.
Looking back,

956
00:54:09,160 --> 00:54:10,450
is there anything you would've done 
differently?

957
00:54:10,960 --> 00:54:12,070
We were.
When I got married

958
00:54:12,130 --> 00:54:15,880
as much,
I would have gone national sooner.

959
00:54:16,420 --> 00:54:21,420
I had the talent,
but I was a big fish in a smaller pond 

960
00:54:21,420 --> 00:54:25,210
in Miami and I liked that I'd radio 
television,

961
00:54:25,211 --> 00:54:27,610
cop column in the Miami Herald.
You know,

962
00:54:28,930 --> 00:54:32,440
everybody knew me in Miami.
I never sent a tape to New York.

963
00:54:33,900 --> 00:54:38,900
I should have.
I would have liked to gone national 

964
00:54:38,900 --> 00:54:41,521
sooner just just to have more success 
earlier you think is to appeal to more 

965
00:54:41,521 --> 00:54:42,400
people.
Of course I had something.

966
00:54:42,470 --> 00:54:47,470
I knew I was good.
I knew I was good at what I did and I,

967
00:54:48,100 --> 00:54:53,100
I didn't really get well known,
so my fifties and I think it couldn't 

968
00:54:53,100 --> 00:54:57,071
happen in the thirties.
I'm not any better than I was in the 

969
00:54:57,071 --> 00:55:00,510
thirties.
I'm not better today than I was when I 

970
00:55:00,510 --> 00:55:00,580
was in my late twenties.
I was.

971
00:55:00,960 --> 00:55:05,960
I was curious.
I always let my ego at the door or was 

972
00:55:05,960 --> 00:55:09,470
there short questions,
always got really interested in the 

973
00:55:09,470 --> 00:55:09,470
guests.
That never changed.

974
00:55:10,210 --> 00:55:14,290
Sometimes someone will play me a tape 
that they had for 30 years ago.

975
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:17,980
Still me.
I'm still.

976
00:55:17,981 --> 00:55:19,870
They're still asking questions.

977
00:55:19,980 --> 00:55:21,660
I think the first time I interviewed 
you,

978
00:55:21,661 --> 00:55:26,661
I asked you something about the ego 
component relative to to interviewing 

979
00:55:26,661 --> 00:55:27,750
and your answer.
I loved it and I.

980
00:55:27,840 --> 00:55:30,000
I've really tried to incorporate it in 
what I do,

981
00:55:30,360 --> 00:55:32,940
which is you said the show was called 
Larry King tonight.

982
00:55:33,120 --> 00:55:34,470
My ego was already stroke.

983
00:55:34,600 --> 00:55:35,830
Yeah,
I'll be there tomorrow.

984
00:55:36,010 --> 00:55:38,320
My model.
It's a good model of David.

985
00:55:38,321 --> 00:55:41,110
Could be your model.
Could be anybody's model.

986
00:55:41,320 --> 00:55:44,920
If Donald trump had this model,
we would be a better country.

987
00:55:45,040 --> 00:55:50,040
This is my motto.
I never learned anything when I was 

988
00:55:50,771 --> 00:55:52,380
talking.
Think about it.

989
00:55:54,070 --> 00:55:56,560
I never learned anything when I was 
talking.

990
00:55:57,810 --> 00:56:00,820
I may impart things to people.
I may have some knowledge,

991
00:56:01,120 --> 00:56:05,350
but I haven't run into anything when I'm
talking.

992
00:56:06,120 --> 00:56:07,800
It feels like a privilege in a way,
right?

993
00:56:07,801 --> 00:56:10,890
When you have somebody great across from
you and you get this,

994
00:56:10,891 --> 00:56:12,780
I'm telling you,
this hour of my life is a privilege.

995
00:56:13,160 --> 00:56:15,500
Oh,
to be on the Rubin report,

996
00:56:16,070 --> 00:56:17,480
to be part of what?
By the way,

997
00:56:17,481 --> 00:56:20,690
census or report.
Do I get a grade?

998
00:56:21,030 --> 00:56:21,860
Be graded at the.
Oh,

999
00:56:21,861 --> 00:56:22,730
trust me,
the youtube,

1000
00:56:24,570 --> 00:56:27,230
youtube comments and shit.
I don't have the where with all.

1001
00:56:27,231 --> 00:56:32,231
How do you see Larry King?
That is the last thing I want to impart 

1002
00:56:32,231 --> 00:56:32,231
on you.
All right,

1003
00:56:32,231 --> 00:56:32,650
final question.
Here we go.

1004
00:56:34,120 --> 00:56:35,650
What's it all about?
I've asked you this,

1005
00:56:35,651 --> 00:56:37,840
I've asked you some version of this many
times a day,

1006
00:56:38,830 --> 00:56:41,620
my friend.
What's it all about and what does it all

1007
00:56:41,621 --> 00:56:41,920
mean?

1008
00:56:42,780 --> 00:56:46,500
What does it mean a hundred years from 
today?

1009
00:56:46,890 --> 00:56:51,890
Who's going to care?
John Lowenstein once hit a grand slam 

1010
00:56:53,671 --> 00:56:58,671
home run for the Orioles to beat the 
Yankees and it was crowd went crazy.

1011
00:56:59,400 --> 00:57:00,330
Someone said,
John,

1012
00:57:00,331 --> 00:57:01,830
how does it feel?
And he said,

1013
00:57:03,040 --> 00:57:08,040
100 million Chinese don't give a damn.
What is it all mean?

1014
00:57:09,270 --> 00:57:11,970
The answer is I don't know.

1015
00:57:14,080 --> 00:57:14,990
All right,
my friend.

1016
00:57:14,991 --> 00:57:19,991
Well,
despite the fact that you did not wear 

1017
00:57:19,991 --> 00:57:19,991
suspenders today,

1018
00:57:19,991 --> 00:57:22,380
I did not.
I wanted to be totally casual with you.

1019
00:57:23,520 --> 00:57:24,250
This true.

1020
00:57:24,310 --> 00:57:27,490
This is what it's about.
What we just did for the last hour.

1021
00:57:27,820 --> 00:57:28,990
Thank you David.
Thank you.

1022
00:57:28,991 --> 00:57:30,820
My pleasure and thank you for the milk 
check.

1023
00:57:31,150 --> 00:57:36,150
Alright,
you guys can check out Larry on TV and 

1024
00:57:36,150 --> 00:57:37,210
follow him on twitter at King's.
Things.
