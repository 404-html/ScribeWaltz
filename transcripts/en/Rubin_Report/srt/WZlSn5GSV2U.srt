1
00:00:05,050 --> 00:00:10,050
Joining me today is an author,
the editorial director of the American 

2
00:00:10,720 --> 00:00:15,720
Institute for Economic Research as well 
as a senior fellow at the Austrian 

3
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:15,720
economic center.
Jeffrey Tucker.

4
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:17,890
Welcome to the Rubin report.
Thanks for having me.

5
00:00:17,950 --> 00:00:22,950
Good to be here.
I almost wore the same bow tie my 

6
00:00:22,950 --> 00:00:22,950
friend.
Really,

7
00:00:22,950 --> 00:00:25,740
I should've brought one extra for you 
that would have been working on this.

8
00:00:26,470 --> 00:00:28,030
All right.
There's a ton I want to talk to you.

9
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:33,440
You're.
You're sort of a one of these people 

10
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:36,001
that are right around all of the topics 
that I'm talking about from freedom and 

11
00:00:36,001 --> 00:00:39,661
liberty and free speech and the battle 
between the left and the right and all 

12
00:00:39,661 --> 00:00:44,191
that,
but your new book and I want to get the 

13
00:00:44,191 --> 00:00:44,500
title absolutely correct.
Right wing collectivism.

14
00:00:44,740 --> 00:00:49,740
The other threat to liberty.
I thought that would be the spot for us 

15
00:00:49,740 --> 00:00:51,580
to kick this off because most of the 
people watching this show know that I've

16
00:00:51,581 --> 00:00:53,350
mostly focused on the left.

17
00:00:53,380 --> 00:00:54,140
Sure,
sure.

18
00:00:54,220 --> 00:00:57,880
Was My home or was it progressive?
I've woken up to it.

19
00:00:57,881 --> 00:01:00,760
I shouldn't.
Real liberalism is obviously,

20
00:01:00,761 --> 00:01:02,440
and that has nothing to do with the 
modern left,

21
00:01:02,980 --> 00:01:04,000
but sometimes people say,
Dave,

22
00:01:04,001 --> 00:01:07,350
you don't critique the right enough.
So let's dive in.

23
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:12,360
What's interesting about talking about 
is that so often the left and the right 

24
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:15,410
are not as distinguishable as they seem 
to be for,

25
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:16,900
for example,
uh,

26
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:17,640
the,
this,

27
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:19,330
this trade stuff.
You know,

28
00:01:19,331 --> 00:01:22,060
Elizabeth Warren and Donald trump 
basically agreed.

29
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:27,600
How do you account for that?
And now we use all the celebration of 

30
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:27,670
the working classes.
You know,

31
00:01:27,671 --> 00:01:30,010
you're going to get again,
uh,

32
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:33,310
the trump,
Ian Wright a green with a Bernie Sanders

33
00:01:33,311 --> 00:01:34,390
on,
on that,

34
00:01:34,900 --> 00:01:39,900
uh,
the left is evermore trending 

35
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:40,300
nationalist and its immigration 
policies,

36
00:01:40,301 --> 00:01:42,190
for example,
that didn't use to be the case.

37
00:01:42,191 --> 00:01:44,340
So how is the left?
Well,

38
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:47,860
well,
like Bernie Sanders complained that free

39
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:52,920
free immigration is,
is a coke or coke industries plot 

40
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:56,080
basically to provide the capitalist 
class cheaper workers for example,

41
00:01:56,530 --> 00:02:01,530
now that you would have never found 
anybody on the left 20 years ago saying 

42
00:02:01,530 --> 00:02:01,530
that,
but,

43
00:02:01,530 --> 00:02:02,950
but now you know what's happening,
you know,

44
00:02:02,951 --> 00:02:03,480
the,
the,

45
00:02:03,610 --> 00:02:04,330
the,
the,

46
00:02:04,380 --> 00:02:05,690
the hatred of the,
of,

47
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:06,910
of commerce.

48
00:02:06,930 --> 00:02:10,000
And,
and the merchant class is so intense now

49
00:02:10,450 --> 00:02:15,450
that if a luxury resort in in Florida 
wants to hire some,

50
00:02:15,490 --> 00:02:18,670
some immigrants to work for them,
then the left is saying,

51
00:02:18,671 --> 00:02:19,490
oh no,
this is,

52
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:22,180
this is terrible because his capitalist 
capitalism at work.

53
00:02:22,181 --> 00:02:24,520
So he was trying to see the strange 
blending.

54
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:27,580
The left and the right have different 
cultural pitches,

55
00:02:27,620 --> 00:02:30,610
a different appeals,
different constituencies,

56
00:02:30,910 --> 00:02:33,460
but they both have this agenda.
That's.

57
00:02:33,490 --> 00:02:35,590
That boils down to the,
to the use of power.

58
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:38,890
Is this a little bit of just what people
refer to as the horseshoe theory,

59
00:02:38,891 --> 00:02:41,470
that the more that the sides had become 
sort of extreme,

60
00:02:41,471 --> 00:02:44,590
that they're oddly,
that I've heard this,

61
00:02:44,591 --> 00:02:49,591
this horseshoe.
I tend to think that's a little bit 

62
00:02:49,591 --> 00:02:51,421
superficial.
I mean I look at it a little bit more 

63
00:02:51,421 --> 00:02:53,011
historically and you see since since 
liberalism was born in the world in the 

64
00:02:53,471 --> 00:02:55,600
18th century,
really high middle ages,

65
00:02:55,601 --> 00:03:00,520
but when the revolt against liberalism 
began the early 19th century,

66
00:03:00,670 --> 00:03:01,090
right?

67
00:03:01,930 --> 00:03:03,940
Too much change,
too much wealth.

68
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,880
The wrong people are getting rich and 
there's not enough control.

69
00:03:07,090 --> 00:03:09,250
What are we gonna do about our religion,
our language,

70
00:03:09,251 --> 00:03:09,910
our rates?
You know,

71
00:03:09,911 --> 00:03:14,911
the,
the revolt began to grow from about the 

72
00:03:14,911 --> 00:03:17,101
18,
20 isn't and intensified and spread to 

73
00:03:17,101 --> 00:03:21,721
the United States.
Britain really began to take root and 

74
00:03:21,721 --> 00:03:22,910
continental Europe.
There took two forms.

75
00:03:22,940 --> 00:03:25,180
There was a left forearm and a right 
form,

76
00:03:25,660 --> 00:03:28,600
and in each country they took.
They took on different generations,

77
00:03:28,601 --> 00:03:32,380
different names he knows so.
So in Britain you had the Tories,

78
00:03:32,381 --> 00:03:37,381
then you had the Labor Labor Party.
They both wanted to use the state for 

79
00:03:37,381 --> 00:03:40,471
their own purposes.
Then you always had the opposition 

80
00:03:40,471 --> 00:03:40,471
party,
which was the liberals,

81
00:03:40,471 --> 00:03:41,420
you know,
and,

82
00:03:41,550 --> 00:03:43,420
and that's the way it's fleshed out 
itself.

83
00:03:43,421 --> 00:03:47,050
In country after country,
the Liberal Party has always been.

84
00:03:47,051 --> 00:03:49,330
The people said,
why don't we just let society be,

85
00:03:49,870 --> 00:03:51,310
let people live their lives.

86
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:54,070
Let them choose a religion of their own,
have their own choice.

87
00:03:54,071 --> 00:03:55,780
If they don't hurt anybody,
that's not a problem.

88
00:03:55,960 --> 00:04:00,960
Let's have free speech.
This have a universal rights as have 

89
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:02,320
rights for this.
Get rid of slavery.

90
00:04:02,321 --> 00:04:07,321
Let's have rights.
The acknowledged the existence of 

91
00:04:07,321 --> 00:04:08,440
women's rights or equality of freedom 
for everybody.

92
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:10,930
Leave everybody alone.
That's the liberal position.

93
00:04:11,530 --> 00:04:14,250
That's a pretty good position.
It's A.

94
00:04:14,250 --> 00:04:16,810
It's a beautiful position and it's,
and it's what I favorites,

95
00:04:16,811 --> 00:04:21,811
but I think it's what built civilization
coming out of the religious wars of the 

96
00:04:21,811 --> 00:04:24,010
high middle ages.
We discovered this idea of freedom.

97
00:04:24,190 --> 00:04:26,200
We tried it,
it worked,

98
00:04:26,590 --> 00:04:29,830
but there's.
But there's always been a revolt brewing

99
00:04:29,831 --> 00:04:31,930
against it,
a resentment,

100
00:04:32,230 --> 00:04:35,200
resentment against it or get resentment 
against the commercial class.

101
00:04:35,201 --> 00:04:36,870
Too much change,
too much wealth,

102
00:04:36,890 --> 00:04:37,960
wrong.
People getting wealthy.

103
00:04:37,961 --> 00:04:39,790
We're not controlling demographics well 
enough.

104
00:04:40,060 --> 00:04:42,400
There's not enough quality.
Whatever the thing is,

105
00:04:42,970 --> 00:04:47,970
it takes different forms in different 
countries and in different times in 

106
00:04:47,970 --> 00:04:50,020
different places,
but ultimately the right and the left or

107
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:55,080
ideologies of control and power and 
liberalism has always been the 

108
00:04:55,421 --> 00:04:57,340
alternative to that.
So.

109
00:04:57,430 --> 00:05:01,480
So we keep having to rediscover this 
again and again and every generation.

110
00:05:01,481 --> 00:05:01,630
Yeah,

111
00:05:01,650 --> 00:05:04,620
well that's why now I'm so happy that 
there is,

112
00:05:04,621 --> 00:05:07,170
as you said to me right before we 
started the phrase,

113
00:05:07,171 --> 00:05:10,680
classical liberalism is coming back.
You know what I mean?

114
00:05:10,681 --> 00:05:15,681
You hear it on tv every now and again.
I like to think that maybe I had a 

115
00:05:15,681 --> 00:05:16,050
little something to do with it,
you know,

116
00:05:16,230 --> 00:05:21,230
and to me it is the only current 
antidote to the problems that we have,

117
00:05:23,701 --> 00:05:28,701
either the the more state power that the
democratic socialist want as they've 

118
00:05:28,701 --> 00:05:33,081
sort of ransacked their own party and 
purged all of the Liberals and it's also

119
00:05:33,271 --> 00:05:38,271
the antidote for all of the people.
If you think trump is all of the 

120
00:05:38,271 --> 00:05:38,340
horrible things that people say about 
them all the time,

121
00:05:38,550 --> 00:05:43,550
what's the antidote?
The antidote isn't to get somebody else 

122
00:05:43,550 --> 00:05:46,011
and then more power to power.
The antidote obviously is to take power 

123
00:05:46,011 --> 00:05:46,470
away from that.
That's what liberalism,

124
00:05:46,940 --> 00:05:51,940
my hope is that,
that there are the good people left the 

125
00:05:51,940 --> 00:05:55,331
center of the left,
that we're looking at the emergence of 

126
00:05:55,331 --> 00:05:58,151
the trump problem.
We'll reconsider a the uses of power and

127
00:05:59,661 --> 00:06:04,661
the executive state and why did we build
this gigantic machinery of the total 

128
00:06:04,661 --> 00:06:07,220
state if it's so vulnerable to being 
captured by our enemies.

129
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:08,690
Right?
Right.

130
00:06:08,850 --> 00:06:11,420
That's the real question that we're at 
right now.

131
00:06:11,421 --> 00:06:16,421
If you believe this thing has been 
captured by the Russians or whatever it 

132
00:06:16,421 --> 00:06:16,421
is,
it's like,

133
00:06:16,421 --> 00:06:17,430
well,
okay,

134
00:06:17,570 --> 00:06:18,900
you're kind of answering your own 
question.

135
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:24,040
I hope that we can,
we can rekindle a kind of a new 

136
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:26,750
resurgence,
but I do have to credit you and Jordan 

137
00:06:26,750 --> 00:06:26,750
Peterson for this.
I mean,

138
00:06:26,750 --> 00:06:31,181
I've been working at it for about 10 
years to try to bring back to the,

139
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:36,880
not just the term liberal,
but the concept of liberalism to,

140
00:06:37,540 --> 00:06:40,070
to public life and a bit.

141
00:06:40,070 --> 00:06:41,990
It's been difficult because,
because,

142
00:06:42,230 --> 00:06:46,910
because we do have the state that 
creates a kind of moral and intellectual

143
00:06:46,911 --> 00:06:50,120
and ideological hazard.
Somebodies got to control it.

144
00:06:50,570 --> 00:06:53,390
And now that we,
we built it over the last hundred years,

145
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:54,030
this,
this,

146
00:06:54,090 --> 00:06:56,720
this total state,
massive taxes,

147
00:06:56,721 --> 00:06:58,970
regulations,
interventions,

148
00:06:59,420 --> 00:07:01,130
uh,
running people's lives.

149
00:07:01,430 --> 00:07:05,540
Everybody's trying to get hold of it and
grab it and beat up their enemies.

150
00:07:05,570 --> 00:07:07,730
And it's a problem.
It's a serious problem.

151
00:07:07,731 --> 00:07:12,731
So when people say to me,
and we've discussed this on the show a 

152
00:07:12,731 --> 00:07:14,951
bunch of times before,
and I've addressed this in several 

153
00:07:14,951 --> 00:07:14,951
forums,
when people say to me,

154
00:07:14,951 --> 00:07:14,951
wait a minute,
when you're,

155
00:07:14,951 --> 00:07:16,640
when you say you're a classical liberal 
in youtube about laissez faire economics

156
00:07:16,641 --> 00:07:18,410
and getting the government out of the 
way and all those things,

157
00:07:18,740 --> 00:07:23,740
really this is just a repackaged 
libertarianism or you're just afraid to 

158
00:07:23,740 --> 00:07:28,391
say that you're a conservative because 
it's still not cool or something like 

159
00:07:28,391 --> 00:07:28,391
that.

160
00:07:28,391 --> 00:07:29,780
How would you define the difference 
between,

161
00:07:29,781 --> 00:07:32,160
say,
a classical liberal and a libertarian?

162
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:34,080
Let's talk about that because,
uh,

163
00:07:34,340 --> 00:07:36,810
because after World War Two,
uh,

164
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:40,190
these new,
these new terms came along,

165
00:07:40,580 --> 00:07:42,380
uh,
one was conservatism.

166
00:07:42,381 --> 00:07:44,710
It wasn't really used before the early 
19 fifties,

167
00:07:44,730 --> 00:07:47,990
Russell Kirk's book called,
uh,

168
00:07:48,350 --> 00:07:51,750
the mindset of a conservative,
simply like the conservative mind,

169
00:07:51,770 --> 00:07:56,770
I think it was what it was called.
And Libertarianism was again a first 

170
00:07:57,501 --> 00:08:01,020
used it about 1957.
Um,

171
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:03,830
by the translator of the works of 
Basquiat.

172
00:08:05,390 --> 00:08:10,390
The problem was the term liberal had 
been captured by the new dealers as 

173
00:08:10,701 --> 00:08:15,701
early as 1933.
Once they acquiesced to the idea of the 

174
00:08:15,701 --> 00:08:19,100
corporate of estate and we're blaming 
the great depression on capitalism,

175
00:08:19,730 --> 00:08:24,730
um,
that became a problem for liberalism 

176
00:08:24,730 --> 00:08:27,821
that kept the term liberalism,
but they were no longer liberal because 

177
00:08:27,821 --> 00:08:31,900
they were suddenly for big government,
there were four big government and even 

178
00:08:31,900 --> 00:08:31,900
worse the corporate state.

179
00:08:31,900 --> 00:08:36,500
And actually we can just be more blunt 
about it and say that back in the 1930,

180
00:08:36,530 --> 00:08:37,030
this,
this,

181
00:08:37,090 --> 00:08:41,370
this ideology had a name.
The name is fascist.

182
00:08:41,630 --> 00:08:42,440
Okay.
So,

183
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:44,810
so the caved,
right.

184
00:08:44,930 --> 00:08:49,930
I mean in the New York Times in 1933,
the New York Times magazine was 

185
00:08:49,930 --> 00:08:53,081
celebrating the great prep professor,
Mussolini and how he and FDR shared a 

186
00:08:53,081 --> 00:08:56,580
vision for the planned economy.
So that's the world we're living in back

187
00:08:56,581 --> 00:08:57,770
then.
So we,

188
00:08:57,800 --> 00:09:00,540
we lost the term liberal after World War
Two.

189
00:09:00,541 --> 00:09:04,590
There was an attempt to,
to just speak a language,

190
00:09:05,070 --> 00:09:10,070
to describe who we are.
And on one hand you had this new thing 

191
00:09:10,070 --> 00:09:11,280
called conservatism and they,
they,

192
00:09:12,060 --> 00:09:14,550
they kind of sampled some of this Tori 
Tori,

193
00:09:14,551 --> 00:09:19,551
like nostalgia for the past,
a little bit of revanchist let's 

194
00:09:19,551 --> 00:09:20,530
recapture what we've lost.
Then you,

195
00:09:20,540 --> 00:09:25,540
on the other hand,
you had the genuine liberals and they 

196
00:09:25,540 --> 00:09:29,000
coined the term libertarianism,
which had been sitting on the shelf 

197
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:29,700
since the late 19th century.

198
00:09:29,730 --> 00:09:32,790
Now most of the people who call 
themselves libertarians in the late 19th

199
00:09:32,791 --> 00:09:35,160
century,
America and England were anarchists,

200
00:09:35,161 --> 00:09:40,161
socialists,
but nobody had bothered with the term 

201
00:09:40,161 --> 00:09:40,830
for decades and decades.
So Dean Russell said,

202
00:09:40,890 --> 00:09:42,420
well,
nobody's using that word.

203
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:45,630
Why don't we use it?
And that was closer to the truth of what

204
00:09:45,631 --> 00:09:47,640
they were in effect.
Well,

205
00:09:47,940 --> 00:09:52,940
what was interesting about that is as 
dean rustled described it in his 1957 

206
00:09:53,161 --> 00:09:58,161
article,
it was a synonym for what was once 

207
00:09:58,161 --> 00:10:01,761
called liberal.
He didn't think it was a tweak or an 

208
00:10:01,761 --> 00:10:05,301
improvement or a distillation or 
refinement or a new dogmatic way of 

209
00:10:06,241 --> 00:10:09,270
describing liberalism.
He thought it was liberalism.

210
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:12,930
So I need to read that because I mean,
that's how I feel.

211
00:10:12,931 --> 00:10:13,860
I don't.
If someone sends me,

212
00:10:13,861 --> 00:10:14,760
Dave,
you're a libertarian.

213
00:10:14,790 --> 00:10:16,740
I don't mind that.
If we need labels,

214
00:10:16,741 --> 00:10:18,740
I don't mind that late.
I don't mind the idea.

215
00:10:18,770 --> 00:10:23,770
You know,
we can split the difference on how much 

216
00:10:23,770 --> 00:10:23,770
government.
Sure,

217
00:10:23,770 --> 00:10:24,840
she'd be the problem.
I think libertarianism as a number,

218
00:10:24,900 --> 00:10:26,280
as a term,
has a number of problems.

219
00:10:26,281 --> 00:10:31,281
One is it's a little clinical sounding 
and it has too many syllables and it 

220
00:10:31,281 --> 00:10:34,581
makes you sound a little bit awkward and
it sounds maybe a little too canonical.

221
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:35,500
You know,
like we,

222
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:38,820
we have a list of things you have to 
believe,

223
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:40,290
you know,
like this,

224
00:10:40,291 --> 00:10:40,920
this,
this,

225
00:10:40,921 --> 00:10:43,410
it's all rooted in this kind of 
reductionist.

226
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:47,960
A more commonly these days is rooted in 
this kind of in a reductionist,

227
00:10:47,970 --> 00:10:52,970
nonaggression principle,
which is a fine principles or rule of 

228
00:10:52,970 --> 00:10:52,970
thumb,
but it's not a good.

229
00:10:52,970 --> 00:10:56,820
It doesn't describe the whole of life.
So the other problem is that 

230
00:10:56,820 --> 00:10:58,410
libertarianism is,
is a new term,

231
00:10:58,411 --> 00:11:03,360
so it doesn't have a deep history.
So we can't look back and say,

232
00:11:03,390 --> 00:11:04,050
oh look.

233
00:11:04,530 --> 00:11:09,530
The Libertarians freed the slaves,
the libertarians a acknowledged to the 

234
00:11:09,530 --> 00:11:11,550
rights of women.
The Libertarians gave us,

235
00:11:11,551 --> 00:11:16,551
the commercial society that built the 
middle class and brought dignity to the 

236
00:11:16,551 --> 00:11:18,480
average person.
If they had existed as a party,

237
00:11:18,481 --> 00:11:20,170
they would have done those.
They would have done this.

238
00:11:20,380 --> 00:11:21,420
Well,
it means the liberals,

239
00:11:21,740 --> 00:11:24,480
but it's deliberate.
We changed our name so now we can like,

240
00:11:24,870 --> 00:11:28,380
feel a sense of pride in our past so it 
doesn't have a past.

241
00:11:29,340 --> 00:11:30,900
So that's a problem.
So we're at.

242
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:34,800
Libertarians tend to be detached from 
their own history for that reason.

243
00:11:34,970 --> 00:11:36,810
And I think it's a problem.
It's a word problem.

244
00:11:37,110 --> 00:11:42,110
The second problem is that 
libertarianism doesn't have a universal 

245
00:11:42,110 --> 00:11:43,800
of usage.
Like whereas liberalism does,

246
00:11:44,070 --> 00:11:46,620
you can go to Spain,
describe yourself and liberal Brazil.

247
00:11:46,621 --> 00:11:48,630
There's,
there's liberals in Germany,

248
00:11:48,631 --> 00:11:53,631
there's liberals,
there's a word for liberalism and every 

249
00:11:53,631 --> 00:11:56,661
language and it more,
less means the same thing except in the 

250
00:11:56,661 --> 00:11:56,661
United States.

251
00:11:56,661 --> 00:11:57,340
Right?
So,

252
00:11:57,420 --> 00:11:57,910
uh,
so,

253
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:03,000
uh,
if we acquiesced to this term 

254
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:03,000
libertarian and just wipe out our 
liberal history,

255
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:06,310
we're cutting off cells off both from 
the world and from our own history.

256
00:12:06,410 --> 00:12:09,910
It's so funny because you've just said 
it in a far better way than I think I've

257
00:12:09,911 --> 00:12:12,220
ever really laid it out.
But people will say to me,

258
00:12:12,221 --> 00:12:15,190
Dave,
stop saying you're a liberal and I don't

259
00:12:15,191 --> 00:12:19,780
want to stop saying I get that.
I'm fighting an uphill battle right now.

260
00:12:19,781 --> 00:12:20,110
Right.
I'm,

261
00:12:20,130 --> 00:12:22,600
I'm a salmon swimming upstream.
This is going to be tough,

262
00:12:22,810 --> 00:12:26,800
but I don't want to deny what is the 
truth just because,

263
00:12:27,010 --> 00:12:30,610
because it's tough.
It's who you are and you want to,

264
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:33,790
you want to have an ancestry,
you know,

265
00:12:33,791 --> 00:12:36,550
you want to look back and,
and see,

266
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:37,330
uh,
the,

267
00:12:37,331 --> 00:12:41,290
the champions are the medic cheese in 
the 15th century,

268
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:43,750
Florence and say,
I know those people.

269
00:12:43,810 --> 00:12:45,310
Those are my people.
You know,

270
00:12:45,490 --> 00:12:47,980
the people who long for a world without 
slavery,

271
00:12:48,130 --> 00:12:49,840
you know,
in the early 19th century,

272
00:12:50,110 --> 00:12:52,900
the people who wanted free trading 
fought hard for it.

273
00:12:52,930 --> 00:12:55,210
Those are our people.
That's our history.

274
00:12:55,660 --> 00:12:56,380
I mean,
we were,

275
00:12:56,440 --> 00:13:01,440
we were born as part of a long stream of
emancipation that's been taking place 

276
00:13:02,021 --> 00:13:04,810
for 500 years.
That's our movement,

277
00:13:04,870 --> 00:13:06,370
our people,
our history.

278
00:13:06,430 --> 00:13:08,950
Let's embrace it.
I'm with your brother.

279
00:13:08,951 --> 00:13:10,100
Yeah.
Alright.

280
00:13:10,150 --> 00:13:15,150
So are there any of those liberals,
a part of the Democratic Party anymore?

281
00:13:16,750 --> 00:13:19,450
Do those people exist?
What's strange?

282
00:13:19,451 --> 00:13:22,120
Things are happening on the left.
Very strange thing.

283
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:24,650
I'm not sure I should pause you for one 
sec.

284
00:13:24,651 --> 00:13:27,110
I my original question here because I 
wanted to do the deep dive on that.

285
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:27,990
Right.
So we're going to get.

286
00:13:28,660 --> 00:13:29,470
We will get.
No,

287
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:31,950
I promise you we're going to get to that
topic.

288
00:13:31,951 --> 00:13:36,951
I mean,
the deep dive of the far right gets us 

289
00:13:36,951 --> 00:13:36,951
into a very dark place.
All right,

290
00:13:36,951 --> 00:13:37,000
well maybe that.
All right,

291
00:13:37,010 --> 00:13:38,780
so maybe the whole second half will be 
on that,

292
00:13:38,790 --> 00:13:40,180
but we just put that out there right 
now.

293
00:13:40,181 --> 00:13:45,181
That's what we'll do for this.
I'm just now getting out of my 

294
00:13:45,181 --> 00:13:45,181
depression having been a book.
It was terrible.

295
00:13:45,181 --> 00:13:49,940
All right,
so our whole second half is going to be 

296
00:13:49,940 --> 00:13:49,940
what my first question was about.
Let's just keep going.

297
00:13:49,940 --> 00:13:49,940
Yeah,
yeah,

298
00:13:49,940 --> 00:13:50,080
yeah.
It would for now.

299
00:13:50,140 --> 00:13:55,140
So,
so strange things have happened to the 

300
00:13:55,140 --> 00:13:55,140
left.

301
00:13:55,140 --> 00:13:58,180
Um,
let's just mention that the phrase 

302
00:13:58,180 --> 00:14:00,540
cultural appropriation for example.
Now when,

303
00:14:00,690 --> 00:14:03,840
when did that,
the approbation of this idea of cultural

304
00:14:03,841 --> 00:14:05,640
appropriation can put two,
three years ago,

305
00:14:05,641 --> 00:14:06,150
three,
four,

306
00:14:06,180 --> 00:14:06,930
five.
I don't know,

307
00:14:07,050 --> 00:14:09,060
academia is weird.
It may have been brewing for 10 years,

308
00:14:09,780 --> 00:14:14,780
but when I first heard about it,
I thought that is the craziest bunch of 

309
00:14:14,780 --> 00:14:16,950
nonsense I've ever heard.
I mean,

310
00:14:16,951 --> 00:14:20,180
civilization is nothing but cultural 
appropriation.

311
00:14:20,210 --> 00:14:24,750
We've been doing this since,
since the 19th century.

312
00:14:24,780 --> 00:14:25,320
You know,
at the,

313
00:14:25,321 --> 00:14:30,321
at the height of the competency and 
Spain where Judaism and Islam and 

314
00:14:31,021 --> 00:14:36,021
Christianity came together in this 
beautiful melting pot where we all learn

315
00:14:36,331 --> 00:14:41,331
from each other and the cultures began 
to blend and our religions began to 

316
00:14:41,331 --> 00:14:41,331
change at our.
Alright,

317
00:14:41,331 --> 00:14:43,890
I'll look on life began to because we 
learned from each other.

318
00:14:43,891 --> 00:14:46,020
If we stay isolated in our little 
tribes,

319
00:14:46,230 --> 00:14:49,320
we're never going to progress and and,
and the idea that,

320
00:14:49,750 --> 00:14:52,550
and I don't know if it was inadvertent 
or what happened,

321
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:54,330
but we can talk about this,
but the,

322
00:14:54,470 --> 00:14:59,470
when,
when suddenly you're told you cannot 

323
00:14:59,470 --> 00:15:02,291
have affection for another culture and 
take what you find valuable and,

324
00:15:02,350 --> 00:15:07,350
and learn,
learn for yourself and live a better 

325
00:15:07,350 --> 00:15:07,350
life.

326
00:15:07,350 --> 00:15:10,570
That is very strange.
They seem to think it's cultural 

327
00:15:10,570 --> 00:15:11,090
annihilation,
not cultural appropriation,

328
00:15:11,180 --> 00:15:12,260
right?
Like they seem to be.

329
00:15:12,340 --> 00:15:16,970
This is something that will lead to the 
destruction of that culture when in fact

330
00:15:17,390 --> 00:15:20,360
it actually spreads the ideas of 
culture,

331
00:15:20,361 --> 00:15:22,250
the foods,
the thing,

332
00:15:22,430 --> 00:15:22,880
the,
the,

333
00:15:22,910 --> 00:15:27,910
the ideas,
not just creating culture as a scarce 

334
00:15:27,910 --> 00:15:30,350
good like it's a property,
but it's not the magic of culture,

335
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:35,500
which is the same magic of ideas is 
resides in its infinite reproducibility 

336
00:15:36,980 --> 00:15:41,980
and its malleability.
This is something that the world of 

337
00:15:41,980 --> 00:15:42,710
ideas can do that the physical world 
cannot do,

338
00:15:42,950 --> 00:15:46,280
and if we don't make that distinction,
we're going to get very confused.

339
00:15:47,410 --> 00:15:48,390
Do you see what I mean?
Emily?

340
00:15:48,770 --> 00:15:53,720
Cultures Spread and the,
they're infinite and they can constantly

341
00:15:53,721 --> 00:15:57,660
change and that's the magic and beauty 
of,

342
00:15:57,700 --> 00:16:00,440
of culture and we can't get that out of 
this glass of water,

343
00:16:00,441 --> 00:16:01,900
this table,
right?

344
00:16:01,910 --> 00:16:02,240
They're,
they're,

345
00:16:02,390 --> 00:16:04,580
they're bound by the constraints of 
scarcity.

346
00:16:04,581 --> 00:16:06,920
But the world of ideas is,
it's magical.

347
00:16:06,921 --> 00:16:08,870
It's like a constant,
constant,

348
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:10,740
infinite sandstorm,
you know,

349
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:15,350
unpredictable.
And I'm constantly changing and we can,

350
00:16:15,650 --> 00:16:20,650
we can take a culture for ourselves 
without taking it from somebody else.

351
00:16:21,681 --> 00:16:22,700
Right?
It's just,

352
00:16:22,730 --> 00:16:23,460
it's,
it's,

353
00:16:23,490 --> 00:16:26,120
it's reproductive reproduction.
It's infinite reproduction.

354
00:16:26,121 --> 00:16:31,121
So loaves and the fishes isn't,
isn't the beauty to that America has 

355
00:16:31,121 --> 00:16:34,100
done this better than anyone perhaps in 
the history of the world.

356
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:36,170
You just referenced some other points in
time,

357
00:16:36,171 --> 00:16:41,150
but that we have taken in more cultures.
And you said the phrase melting pot.

358
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:44,570
I mean that.
That's what we designed and set up here,

359
00:16:44,660 --> 00:16:49,660
the most beautiful melting pot ever.
I lived in New York City for most of my 

360
00:16:49,660 --> 00:16:50,480
life,
most of my adult life at least,

361
00:16:50,630 --> 00:16:55,630
and would be on subway cars.
And you are on that car with absolutely 

362
00:16:55,630 --> 00:16:59,510
everyone with have white guys with 
dreadlocks and the whole thing.

363
00:17:00,410 --> 00:17:05,410
And guess what?
You may not like everybody and you may 

364
00:17:05,410 --> 00:17:05,410
not like the way this guy smells and 
that person may be doing this,

365
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:08,780
but we're all there living together.
It's magic.

366
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:10,460
You know,
it's,

367
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:12,080
it's,
it really,

368
00:17:12,081 --> 00:17:17,081
it's commerce.
It's because this country elevated the 

369
00:17:17,081 --> 00:17:20,450
commercial ethos to be the highest thing
that great and no bling factor of,

370
00:17:20,510 --> 00:17:21,200
of,
of,

371
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:26,280
of human life.
And it's commerce that brings people 

372
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:26,280
together.
And we experienced that every day.

373
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:26,510
You know,
you can,

374
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:28,710
in a commercial setting,
uh,

375
00:17:28,730 --> 00:17:30,980
people aren't fighting each other,
they're getting along.

376
00:17:30,981 --> 00:17:32,810
I mean,
I find I'm with you.

377
00:17:32,811 --> 00:17:35,360
I go to,
I go to a restaurant and I get served by

378
00:17:35,390 --> 00:17:37,230
some guy from,
from uh,

379
00:17:37,250 --> 00:17:40,910
Pakistan.
It's a chance to meet somebody new.

380
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:46,120
It's a chance to engage somebody and I 
have a personal relationship with 

381
00:17:46,120 --> 00:17:47,810
somebody who's serving you and you're 
serving them.

382
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:50,610
And you experienced this magic of 
exchange.

383
00:17:51,090 --> 00:17:54,510
A Benjamin consultant used to talk about
this and the and the 18 thirties,

384
00:17:54,511 --> 00:17:56,010
how,
how,

385
00:17:56,140 --> 00:18:01,140
how commerce brought to the world and 
new understanding of freedom and a new 

386
00:18:01,951 --> 00:18:06,090
opportunity for us to find value in each
other,

387
00:18:06,210 --> 00:18:10,650
in service of each other and see.
And America just flourished in commerce.

388
00:18:10,651 --> 00:18:12,090
And that's why.
That's why we have,

389
00:18:12,780 --> 00:18:15,180
you know,
the diversity and the end.

390
00:18:15,181 --> 00:18:19,320
This melting pot they call it.
And this rich cultural life.

391
00:18:19,390 --> 00:18:24,390
You know,
it's so funny because I'm so keenly 

392
00:18:24,390 --> 00:18:26,161
aware of it right now.
Not only because of the conversations 

393
00:18:26,161 --> 00:18:26,650
I'm having and because people are 
screaming about this stuff all the time,

394
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:32,040
but you know,
I'm on this tour with Jordan Peterson 

395
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:32,040
and when I go to every airport that I go
to,

396
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:32,620
I,
90 percent of the time,

397
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:37,800
unless someone's had a car for me,
I take an uber and I just happened 

398
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:40,730
whatever rubric and there is there,
there is every single type of person 

399
00:18:40,730 --> 00:18:44,530
that looks every which way color every 
sexuality.

400
00:18:44,650 --> 00:18:47,370
And usually I talk a little bit to,
to them it's,

401
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:48,700
you know,
and it's like,

402
00:18:48,701 --> 00:18:50,470
man,
these are just people,

403
00:18:50,830 --> 00:18:52,870
you know,
I'm maybe for the same way,

404
00:18:53,010 --> 00:18:54,340
you know,
I live in Atlanta,

405
00:18:54,341 --> 00:18:56,650
which is just a gigantic really diverse 
society,

406
00:18:56,651 --> 00:19:01,651
you know,
and everywhere you go you're bumping 

407
00:19:01,651 --> 00:19:01,651
into people who are different from you 
and,

408
00:19:01,651 --> 00:19:02,860
and hang around and crypto circles in 
Atlanta.

409
00:19:02,861 --> 00:19:06,190
I want to talk to you and that you're 
talking about a melting pot.

410
00:19:06,191 --> 00:19:09,970
I mean we're all together and there are,
we all consider each other are people,

411
00:19:09,971 --> 00:19:14,971
you know,
just because we all love crypto and it 

412
00:19:14,971 --> 00:19:14,971
has nothing to do with,
with race.

413
00:19:14,971 --> 00:19:16,490
You can appreciate racial differences 
with,

414
00:19:16,770 --> 00:19:21,770
but also see value in everybody and hope
they can see value in you.

415
00:19:22,111 --> 00:19:27,111
You can come together.
It doesn't mean that we have to be 

416
00:19:27,111 --> 00:19:28,350
egalitarian or,
or denied differences.

417
00:19:28,530 --> 00:19:33,000
It means that we find strength and our 
heterogeneity and,

418
00:19:33,070 --> 00:19:38,070
and that's,
that makes for a beautiful and exciting 

419
00:19:38,070 --> 00:19:41,460
life.
One of the strangest things that's 

420
00:19:41,460 --> 00:19:43,671
happening now with the rise of the 
outright in response to the failures and

421
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:48,910
strange and so the left is this new 
celebration of homogeneity as if,

422
00:19:49,110 --> 00:19:54,110
oh,
we need to live in a unitary racial 

423
00:19:54,110 --> 00:19:54,110
state,
you know,

424
00:19:54,110 --> 00:19:55,830
where we all speak the same language are
all the same religion.

425
00:19:55,980 --> 00:19:59,640
So that strikes me as this theoretically
very boring and I don't,

426
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:04,700
I don't even recognize what that world 
would look like and feel like and it 

427
00:20:04,700 --> 00:20:04,800
doesn't appeal to me in the slightest 
bit.

428
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:05,790
Yeah.
My nerdy.

429
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:10,960
It was built out of the,
out of the diversity that grows out of 

430
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:14,900
commerce and the commerce is the key 
because that's what helps us invest in 

431
00:20:14,900 --> 00:20:15,620
each other.
You know,

432
00:20:15,630 --> 00:20:17,760
Adam Smith said this about the division 
of Labor,

433
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:20,070
right?
It's like what causes wealth?

434
00:20:20,670 --> 00:20:22,890
The division of Labor,
how big can that be?

435
00:20:22,891 --> 00:20:26,220
It should be as big as possible.
The wider the division of Labor,

436
00:20:26,221 --> 00:20:31,221
the more people you include in the great
project of of building commercial life 

437
00:20:32,070 --> 00:20:37,070
and production,
the wealthier we're all going to be 

438
00:20:37,070 --> 00:20:37,980
together and I just,
I love that vision.

439
00:20:38,370 --> 00:20:38,970
So when

440
00:20:39,670 --> 00:20:40,910
we talk about capitalism,
I,

441
00:20:40,911 --> 00:20:45,911
they show I'll every now and again I 
jumped in the comment section or I see 

442
00:20:45,911 --> 00:20:45,911
what people say on twitter.
If I have,

443
00:20:45,911 --> 00:20:50,581
you know,
some of the Iran on or just some of the 

444
00:20:50,581 --> 00:20:50,581
people

445
00:20:50,581 --> 00:20:52,980
that are not for regulation at all and 
just let the economy go and see what 

446
00:20:52,980 --> 00:20:56,821
happens.
There's always a certain amount of 

447
00:20:56,821 --> 00:20:56,821
people that say,
okay,

448
00:20:56,821 --> 00:20:59,311
that all sounds well and good,
but then the rich keep getting richer 

449
00:20:59,311 --> 00:21:00,940
and the poor keep getting poorer and 
Jeff Bezos shouldn't have,

450
00:21:01,290 --> 00:21:03,310
you know,
$20,000,000,000,000

451
00:21:03,311 --> 00:21:04,900
or whatever he has right now are the 
rest of it.

452
00:21:05,020 --> 00:21:10,020
What's the,
what's the boiler plate answer to why 

453
00:21:10,020 --> 00:21:10,630
you eventually end up with those kind of
cliche.

454
00:21:10,631 --> 00:21:15,631
It's because they've been,
they've been around for 150 years and 

455
00:21:15,631 --> 00:21:18,061
they've never been true.
I mean that they weren't true and 

456
00:21:18,061 --> 00:21:19,510
Marxists time and everybody quickly 
recognize that going to by the late 19th

457
00:21:19,511 --> 00:21:21,820
century in America,
we had,

458
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:25,480
we had built the most prosperous economy
in the world by far,

459
00:21:25,481 --> 00:21:28,330
by far,
by far growing incomes,

460
00:21:28,331 --> 00:21:30,430
longer lives,
healthier people,

461
00:21:30,431 --> 00:21:33,580
more opportunities for everybody.
People are moving to the cities.

462
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:38,880
Everybody's benefiting from capitalism.
That's been going on for such a long 

463
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:42,181
time.
Yet here we are in 2018 and we're still 

464
00:21:42,181 --> 00:21:43,630
recycling these,
these Victorian era cliche.

465
00:21:43,631 --> 00:21:45,570
It's about capitalism.
I don't understand it.

466
00:21:45,670 --> 00:21:50,670
What do you think capitalism then 
screwed up if if only just a marketing 

467
00:21:50,670 --> 00:21:54,840
piece of it or something where right now
you sent and I believe that it will not 

468
00:21:55,020 --> 00:22:00,020
win.
It somehow doesn't seem cool to be for 

469
00:22:00,020 --> 00:22:00,100
capitalism,
at least with the.

470
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:03,880
He does seem to be the the change.
Maybe it's in the name and I.

471
00:22:04,340 --> 00:22:08,050
I don't even have a problem not using 
the word capitalism.

472
00:22:08,051 --> 00:22:10,570
I mean I will probably have the same 
view towards this.

473
00:22:10,571 --> 00:22:15,571
I will speak the language that you can 
understand and if I want to rebrand 

474
00:22:15,610 --> 00:22:20,610
capitalism as liberalism,
which it probably should be actually 

475
00:22:20,610 --> 00:22:20,610
liberal liberalism,
then I'm,

476
00:22:20,650 --> 00:22:23,440
I'm glad to talk about that.
Same time.

477
00:22:23,441 --> 00:22:27,630
I kinda liked the term capitalism.
I have no problem with capital because,

478
00:22:27,660 --> 00:22:32,660
because it,
it really does underscore really 

479
00:22:32,660 --> 00:22:33,610
important point that without private 
property and the in the and ownership of

480
00:22:33,611 --> 00:22:38,611
the means of production,
you can't have a complex production 

481
00:22:38,611 --> 00:22:40,090
structures and you can't hire more 
people.

482
00:22:40,091 --> 00:22:42,550
You can't,
you can't build great things.

483
00:22:42,551 --> 00:22:45,040
You can have great cities.
You can't improve people's lives.

484
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:47,740
So what are the things that you think 
government should do?

485
00:22:50,020 --> 00:22:55,020
Well,
I think of lots of clans rules that we 

486
00:22:55,020 --> 00:22:55,450
should have.
Um,

487
00:22:55,480 --> 00:22:58,570
but I'm not a fan of governments in 
general.

488
00:22:58,810 --> 00:23:02,020
If there was some way that you could 
have,

489
00:23:02,950 --> 00:23:04,780
you know,
an old fashioned the state,

490
00:23:04,900 --> 00:23:06,370
you know,
that was really minded,

491
00:23:06,371 --> 00:23:11,371
his own business and um,
kept kept civil war from happening,

492
00:23:12,130 --> 00:23:13,300
for example,
you know,

493
00:23:13,301 --> 00:23:15,760
kept conflict,
that kind of mass conflict.

494
00:23:16,260 --> 00:23:18,040
Um,
then that would be a probably a good,

495
00:23:18,130 --> 00:23:19,780
a good thing.
Um,

496
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:22,900
state is not very good at that.
So,

497
00:23:23,080 --> 00:23:23,910
um,
I,

498
00:23:23,920 --> 00:23:26,200
I think,
I mean I've got,

499
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:29,500
I've got the mind of an addict because 
to essentially I trust,

500
00:23:29,870 --> 00:23:34,870
I trust the chaos of,
of spontaneous human action much more 

501
00:23:34,961 --> 00:23:36,580
than any kind of,
of,

502
00:23:36,820 --> 00:23:38,520
of imposition.
Yeah.

503
00:23:38,530 --> 00:23:40,060
But,
but I'm at same time,

504
00:23:40,061 --> 00:23:41,980
I do like the writings of the old 
liberals,

505
00:23:41,981 --> 00:23:42,390
you know,
they,

506
00:23:42,391 --> 00:23:47,391
they imagine that the state should do 
something to keep something like order 

507
00:23:47,391 --> 00:23:49,800
in life to keep civil war from 
happening,

508
00:23:49,830 --> 00:23:51,590
to keep people from killing each other.

509
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:55,040
A terrible things like that.
But beyond that state should just,

510
00:23:55,400 --> 00:24:00,400
it should be a laissez faire.
It should just allow commerce to 

511
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:01,850
flourish and allow,
allow problems to work themselves out.

512
00:24:01,851 --> 00:24:06,851
I am.
People don't have confidence in that 

513
00:24:06,851 --> 00:24:06,851
anymore,
but not because of any failure,

514
00:24:06,851 --> 00:24:11,771
but it's almost like the ideology of 
power has become a kind of a modern 

515
00:24:12,111 --> 00:24:17,111
cancer that affects a flicks everyone.
And I think we need to do something 

516
00:24:17,111 --> 00:24:17,130
about it.
Wait,

517
00:24:17,180 --> 00:24:18,860
can you explain that a little bit?
Well,

518
00:24:18,861 --> 00:24:23,861
it's just a.
Once you believe that you can control 

519
00:24:23,861 --> 00:24:26,480
the path of history and you have an 
endpoint in mind,

520
00:24:26,690 --> 00:24:31,690
society should look like this.
Then you want to use every kind of tool 

521
00:24:31,690 --> 00:24:35,000
to hammer it in place.
And this is what I called right and left

522
00:24:35,001 --> 00:24:37,410
wing who galleon agonism essentially.
And it's,

523
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:40,610
it's a grave temptation.
And so we built this,

524
00:24:40,700 --> 00:24:45,700
like we said at the outset,
and we built this gigantic machinery we 

525
00:24:45,700 --> 00:24:46,520
call the state this total state and a 
control.

526
00:24:46,520 --> 00:24:50,750
So much wealth and so much power and so 
much rests with,

527
00:24:51,170 --> 00:24:51,550
with,
uh,

528
00:24:51,650 --> 00:24:53,010
getting,
you know,

529
00:24:53,060 --> 00:24:58,060
gaining access to it,
that it just a kind of a constant moral 

530
00:24:58,060 --> 00:24:58,700
hazard for everybody,
like,

531
00:24:58,701 --> 00:25:03,701
give,
give me that state and I'll make it do 

532
00:25:03,701 --> 00:25:05,741
the right things.
So for the people that are on either 

533
00:25:05,741 --> 00:25:05,741
side of this,
whether you're on the left and,

534
00:25:05,741 --> 00:25:10,330
and you want to help those that you deem
have pressed more people with less when 

535
00:25:10,330 --> 00:25:15,160
I believe their intentions to be good,
even if their methodology I think 

536
00:25:15,160 --> 00:25:18,281
generally is not good.
Or your people on the right that want 

537
00:25:18,281 --> 00:25:18,281
less of the state.
But you know,

538
00:25:18,281 --> 00:25:18,410
you're just on either side of this 
thing.

539
00:25:18,890 --> 00:25:23,890
How much do you think the system itself 
can move without breaking?

540
00:25:24,830 --> 00:25:29,830
Because what I think I'm noticing now is
that there's a certain amount of people 

541
00:25:29,830 --> 00:25:33,041
that really just want to trash the whole
thing and I do see this certainly more 

542
00:25:33,041 --> 00:25:37,481
on the left right now because they're 
not empower that there's this growing 

543
00:25:37,481 --> 00:25:39,200
thing and this is why they're so into 
Marxism and all this stuff now.

544
00:25:39,380 --> 00:25:44,380
It's like let's just trash the whole 
freaking thing and forget all the 

545
00:25:44,380 --> 00:25:47,021
goodness that this is done.
And they're doing it from their iphones 

546
00:25:47,021 --> 00:25:47,930
and you know,
their sense of irony is not great,

547
00:25:48,050 --> 00:25:49,240
but is there,
is there,

548
00:25:50,360 --> 00:25:55,360
is there just a certain amount that,
a system that's basically good can move 

549
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:57,020
before it snaps?
And I,

550
00:25:57,060 --> 00:25:59,810
I would suspect that that's not much 
either way really.

551
00:26:00,510 --> 00:26:02,870
Uh,
you mean the commercial structure?

552
00:26:02,871 --> 00:26:05,750
Right now our lives are capitalist 
structures.

553
00:26:05,751 --> 00:26:07,220
I mean the state,
um,

554
00:26:07,370 --> 00:26:12,370
you know,
what I see actually happening is the 

555
00:26:12,370 --> 00:26:12,370
innovation has taken place so quickly.
It's actually out running.

556
00:26:12,370 --> 00:26:14,840
They have the capacity of government to 
control it.

557
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:17,870
And I think that's,
that's really exciting if I was going to

558
00:26:17,871 --> 00:26:22,871
look at one point of hope in the world 
and set the market and the 

559
00:26:22,941 --> 00:26:27,941
entrepreneurial innovative sectors of 
life from the APP economy to the Gig 

560
00:26:27,941 --> 00:26:31,391
economy to now with blockchain 
technology and everything is moving so 

561
00:26:31,391 --> 00:26:34,220
quickly that states can't,
can't even keep up.

562
00:26:34,250 --> 00:26:39,250
Right.
So I'm there with you on that because 

563
00:26:39,250 --> 00:26:39,250
Gloria.
So I'm very happy about that.

564
00:26:39,250 --> 00:26:41,390
I don't see that because it's.
To me it's like how are people listening

565
00:26:41,391 --> 00:26:44,100
to all of these conversations,
all of these podcasts that are out there

566
00:26:44,100 --> 00:26:47,310
and communicating about them so quickly 
and it's like the government can't.

567
00:26:47,610 --> 00:26:52,610
I can't keep up with all of that.
The change can't because people are 

568
00:26:52,610 --> 00:26:54,420
lighting up all the time now in a much 
faster way.

569
00:26:54,570 --> 00:26:59,570
And I think we're changing in a much 
more rapid way and I think that's 

570
00:26:59,570 --> 00:27:02,931
actually really cool.
There's a danger to it because we could 

571
00:27:02,931 --> 00:27:02,931
just spin out of control and do all 
sorts of awful things.

572
00:27:02,931 --> 00:27:04,270
But what you said,
well,

573
00:27:04,340 --> 00:27:09,340
what did you say before about the 
general inertia of people or something 

574
00:27:09,340 --> 00:27:12,450
that the general left to their own ways 
of figuring things out?

575
00:27:12,451 --> 00:27:13,280
I figured it out.

576
00:27:14,650 --> 00:27:19,240
The reason why our politics seem 
reactionary on the left and the right.

577
00:27:19,300 --> 00:27:22,060
Everyone's trying to bring back 
something.

578
00:27:22,540 --> 00:27:27,540
There's a nostalgia on the left and then
establish a on the right and they're 

579
00:27:27,540 --> 00:27:31,141
trying to use the state to hold us back 
like in and whatever.

580
00:27:31,211 --> 00:27:33,400
It's a vision of the.
Is it the sixties?

581
00:27:33,401 --> 00:27:35,380
Is it,
is it the seventies?

582
00:27:35,381 --> 00:27:38,230
Is it preindustrial revolution,
you know,

583
00:27:38,231 --> 00:27:43,231
is at some risks.
So he and fantasy of perfect equality 

584
00:27:43,231 --> 00:27:43,400
and the,
the left might imagine,

585
00:27:43,420 --> 00:27:44,460
or,
or,

586
00:27:44,461 --> 00:27:45,760
or the ride,
uh,

587
00:27:45,790 --> 00:27:47,080
thinking about,
you know,

588
00:27:47,081 --> 00:27:51,320
a world of high tariffs of the 18,
eighties or nineties are.

589
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:56,760
But everyone's looking back to something
that they want to create and there's a 

590
00:27:56,760 --> 00:27:58,150
real fear of the future and the left and
the right.

591
00:27:58,360 --> 00:28:03,360
And as a future without control,
it's a future where we're able to 

592
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:04,390
travel,
where we want to download the apps.

593
00:28:04,391 --> 00:28:07,450
We want to invent what we want to work 
by ourselves,

594
00:28:07,451 --> 00:28:11,050
live where we want to live,
be digital nomads,

595
00:28:11,310 --> 00:28:12,610
you know,
travel around,

596
00:28:12,611 --> 00:28:14,440
do it.
We want this,

597
00:28:14,530 --> 00:28:17,780
this world.
That's not what people should be.

598
00:28:17,781 --> 00:28:19,450
Fewer people.
Everyone should be going,

599
00:28:19,451 --> 00:28:21,880
holy cow,
this is the free is coolest thing ever.

600
00:28:21,940 --> 00:28:24,130
That's the world I want to live in.
I want to live.

601
00:28:24,280 --> 00:28:29,280
That obviously is why you're so 
attracted to bitcoin and crypto in 

602
00:28:29,280 --> 00:28:30,160
general because you're sort of the 
backbone.

603
00:28:30,310 --> 00:28:32,380
Well out of this.
I mean if you think about it,

604
00:28:32,510 --> 00:28:37,510
I mean we've waited our whole lives and 
actually generations of great 

605
00:28:37,510 --> 00:28:38,780
intellectuals have lived and lived and 
died for so long,

606
00:28:39,050 --> 00:28:43,040
wanting something like a private 
currency that,

607
00:28:43,550 --> 00:28:48,550
that emerged privately,
that operates without financial 

608
00:28:48,550 --> 00:28:51,611
intermediaries,
that the government is not controlling 

609
00:28:51,611 --> 00:28:51,611
that it's global.
That doesn't.

610
00:28:51,611 --> 00:28:55,160
It's not restrained by currency zones 
that anyone could have access to.

611
00:28:55,730 --> 00:29:00,730
You know,
a true democratic technology like 

612
00:29:00,730 --> 00:29:01,970
bitcoin or any cryptocurrency.
That is just a dream come true.

613
00:29:02,030 --> 00:29:04,790
That is Gloria.
That's why I write about it all the time

614
00:29:04,791 --> 00:29:06,350
and talk about it all the time.
It is,

615
00:29:06,351 --> 00:29:08,750
it is the outright killer.
It is the alt left killer.

616
00:29:09,030 --> 00:29:14,030
It's,
it's the thing that's going to 

617
00:29:14,030 --> 00:29:14,030
ultimately,
I think,

618
00:29:14,030 --> 00:29:17,380
protect us from these wicked ideologies 
that are constantly trying to control 

619
00:29:17,380 --> 00:29:17,380
their lives

620
00:29:17,380 --> 00:29:22,070
because basically at some point one of 
these ideologies is gonna get too much 

621
00:29:22,070 --> 00:29:24,250
control of the state forever.

622
00:29:24,250 --> 00:29:25,030
I mean,
you know,

623
00:29:25,060 --> 00:29:30,060
one of the things that I think about 
this sometimes when you get depressed 

624
00:29:30,060 --> 00:29:31,710
about the divisions in our public life 
and the way people are tearing,

625
00:29:31,780 --> 00:29:34,450
tearing each other apart and the way you
opened up the newspaper and this,

626
00:29:34,540 --> 00:29:36,900
you can barely even read it anymore.
You know,

627
00:29:37,070 --> 00:29:38,790
it was like,
yeah,

628
00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:39,670
I know.
I know,

629
00:29:39,671 --> 00:29:41,690
but it's like Donald Trump.
You then just like,

630
00:29:41,691 --> 00:29:42,580
you know,
I'll put trump,

631
00:29:42,610 --> 00:29:43,450
you know,
and it's just,

632
00:29:43,680 --> 00:29:48,680
it's just this forever debate.
And the one thing that I think maybe we 

633
00:29:49,151 --> 00:29:51,460
should not be entirely unhappy about 
this.

634
00:29:51,461 --> 00:29:53,140
As you look back at history,
when,

635
00:29:53,170 --> 00:29:55,780
when freedom emerges out of the high 
middle ages,

636
00:29:56,050 --> 00:30:01,050
it wasn't because any one great 
intellectual or anyone great state or 

637
00:30:01,050 --> 00:30:02,200
anyone great power said,
hey,

638
00:30:02,201 --> 00:30:07,201
let's let everybody be free.
It was because there's so many 

639
00:30:07,201 --> 00:30:07,630
competitors for power.
They nobody could,

640
00:30:07,750 --> 00:30:12,010
could gain the monopoly was the church,
it was the,

641
00:30:12,100 --> 00:30:17,100
the nation state,
it was the localities and monarchical 

642
00:30:17,100 --> 00:30:17,590
state,
uh,

643
00:30:17,740 --> 00:30:19,780
the,
the landed aristocracy,

644
00:30:20,020 --> 00:30:20,520
you know,
the,

645
00:30:20,521 --> 00:30:22,390
the,
the rise of the merchant class,

646
00:30:22,391 --> 00:30:25,090
you know,
so there are all these independent power

647
00:30:25,091 --> 00:30:28,390
centers strewn throughout European 
society and nobody could get,

648
00:30:29,470 --> 00:30:33,190
get access to the finals,
single singular control,

649
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:34,810
no unitary power.

650
00:30:35,080 --> 00:30:40,080
And that fight that took place amongst 
so many disparate powers to actually 

651
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:41,770
lead to a kind of flourishing of 
freedom.

652
00:30:42,190 --> 00:30:47,190
So you know,
in a sense the fight between the left 

653
00:30:47,190 --> 00:30:47,190
and the right today is not the worst 
thing.

654
00:30:47,190 --> 00:30:49,750
If they just keep fighting and leave the
rest of us alone.

655
00:30:50,740 --> 00:30:53,170
I don't know where we're going to be 
that lucky,

656
00:30:53,171 --> 00:30:55,630
but okay,
so before we spend the whole second half

657
00:30:55,631 --> 00:31:00,631
on the question that I started this 
whole thing with the people who want 

658
00:31:00,631 --> 00:31:01,780
freedom basically,
and a light touch of government,

659
00:31:02,020 --> 00:31:07,020
are they always at a disadvantage 
because there's another set of people 

660
00:31:07,020 --> 00:31:09,370
who will always use the apparatus 
against them where if they're being true

661
00:31:09,371 --> 00:31:12,820
to themselves,
they won't use the power to stifle other

662
00:31:12,821 --> 00:31:14,350
people.
There were all sorts of other things,

663
00:31:14,440 --> 00:31:17,120
so in an odd way our ideas are at a 
disadvantage,

664
00:31:17,121 --> 00:31:17,860
always have been.

665
00:31:17,860 --> 00:31:20,830
We've always been a kind of minority.
So even again,

666
00:31:20,831 --> 00:31:25,831
over the last two or 300 years of 
political history have always been the 

667
00:31:25,831 --> 00:31:26,980
third way.
That's fine,

668
00:31:26,981 --> 00:31:27,970
man already.
But we had,

669
00:31:28,330 --> 00:31:30,400
we had rare victories,
but big ones,

670
00:31:30,580 --> 00:31:32,230
you know,
like the end of slavery,

671
00:31:32,380 --> 00:31:33,400
you know,
um,

672
00:31:33,460 --> 00:31:38,460
was just glorious.
I mean the protection of the great 

673
00:31:38,460 --> 00:31:39,490
banking empires of Europe from,
from the populace rabble,

674
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:40,120
you know,
from the,

675
00:31:40,150 --> 00:31:42,550
from the preachers who wanted to destroy
it.

676
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:45,940
There were these great victories of the 
victory of free trade,

677
00:31:46,120 --> 00:31:47,290
you know,
but,

678
00:31:47,470 --> 00:31:51,570
but we've won every once in a while and 
it always changed the world because once

679
00:31:51,571 --> 00:31:53,980
we have a little bit of freedom just a 
little bit,

680
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:57,310
it just blows up and it becomes awesome 
and it's amazing and it.

681
00:31:57,340 --> 00:32:00,670
And it kills power because it's so 
powerful and so wonderful.

682
00:32:00,850 --> 00:32:02,140
But it's worth fighting for.

683
00:32:02,410 --> 00:32:05,170
And we've always fought mainly through 
ideas,

684
00:32:05,410 --> 00:32:08,830
not through armies,
not through through guns and controlling

685
00:32:08,831 --> 00:32:13,831
states.
It's always been the philosophical 

686
00:32:13,831 --> 00:32:16,210
awesomeness of this position has been 
the celebration of the common man,

687
00:32:16,390 --> 00:32:17,470
uh,
uh,

688
00:32:17,500 --> 00:32:19,450
the celebration of,
of wealth,

689
00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:24,480
of the love of,
of consumerism and commercial life for 

690
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:27,760
the coming together of people,
the noble meant of people that the right

691
00:32:27,780 --> 00:32:28,900
of,
of travel,

692
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:34,440
the right of association,
and to do what you want to have as many 

693
00:32:34,440 --> 00:32:35,700
children as you want to educate your 
kids the way you want to,

694
00:32:35,710 --> 00:32:40,710
that these kinds of principles are 
compelling and they've always lead to 

695
00:32:40,710 --> 00:32:45,491
victory for liberals despite the 
pressure from the other two sides.

696
00:32:46,460 --> 00:32:48,200
And I think it's,
I think it's going to be our future.

697
00:32:48,201 --> 00:32:49,670
I do.
Let's shift.

698
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,220
Let's talk about the scary.
Right?

699
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:54,300
Are you ready?
I tried to do this and we adapted.

700
00:32:54,360 --> 00:32:57,410
We did the happy stuff.
Now we're going to plunge to look.

701
00:32:57,440 --> 00:32:57,910
You know,
David,

702
00:32:57,920 --> 00:33:02,920
when I began to research this thing,
I probably ended up reading about 200 

703
00:33:02,920 --> 00:33:05,420
books on this topic when the end and,
and I'm a happy guy.

704
00:33:05,421 --> 00:33:08,720
I like happy things like technology.
I'm an optimistic guy,

705
00:33:08,721 --> 00:33:12,140
but this really put me in a dark place,
a digging through this history,

706
00:33:12,220 --> 00:33:13,070
uh,
from,

707
00:33:13,100 --> 00:33:16,010
from Hagle,
essentially up to Julius Caesar,

708
00:33:16,011 --> 00:33:21,011
Eveleigh and the,
and the post were Nazi movement and 

709
00:33:21,011 --> 00:33:24,371
realizing that there is an intellectual 
strain that stretched over all of these 

710
00:33:24,380 --> 00:33:26,810
years.
Let's go back 200 years.

711
00:33:26,811 --> 00:33:29,390
Yeah.
So let's go back 200 years when you talk

712
00:33:29,391 --> 00:33:32,360
about right wing collectivism.
Yeah.

713
00:33:33,050 --> 00:33:38,050
Because I think most of my audience now 
understands what left wing collectivism 

714
00:33:38,050 --> 00:33:38,050
is because that's what we've got right 
now.

715
00:33:38,270 --> 00:33:43,270
Very in a very strong way.
Talk to me about right wing 

716
00:33:43,270 --> 00:33:43,270
collectivism.

717
00:33:43,270 --> 00:33:43,270
Okay.
Dave,

718
00:33:43,270 --> 00:33:45,170
I'm going to tell you a story.
Um,

719
00:33:45,730 --> 00:33:47,890
I,
I love Ludovico muses.

720
00:33:47,900 --> 00:33:49,340
I think it was a genius,
right?

721
00:33:50,120 --> 00:33:55,120
And I thought I'd read all of his works,
but in there is a transcript of a 

722
00:33:55,120 --> 00:33:59,741
lecture he gave in 1956 at the San 
Francisco Public Library and he had 

723
00:34:00,081 --> 00:34:05,081
about three sentences in there that just
knocked me over it and I couldn't 

724
00:34:05,081 --> 00:34:09,521
believe it because it explained so much.
He says something like this and he's 

725
00:34:09,521 --> 00:34:10,570
speaking casually,
right?

726
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:16,000
It says,
hagle ruined German philosophy for a 

727
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:16,000
century.
Uh,

728
00:34:16,400 --> 00:34:20,330
his original followers became a,
W,

729
00:34:20,390 --> 00:34:25,390
believed that all of history would end 
in the Prussian state and the Prussian 

730
00:34:25,390 --> 00:34:27,400
church having all power and the 
individualism,

731
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:32,440
individualism,
they became the right hit galleons that 

732
00:34:32,440 --> 00:34:34,520
became the Nazis is the dissonance of 
this,

733
00:34:34,710 --> 00:34:35,760
uh,
of the writer.

734
00:34:35,780 --> 00:34:40,780
Galleons became the left to galleons.
They wanted a universal transformation 

735
00:34:40,780 --> 00:34:44,651
of humanity and a historical drive to 
something other than the commercial 

736
00:34:44,841 --> 00:34:45,350
society.

737
00:34:45,350 --> 00:34:48,760
They became the Marxists and,
uh,

738
00:34:48,830 --> 00:34:51,980
and the communists.
And he said that that's it's left,

739
00:34:51,981 --> 00:34:55,370
right Galleon ism and that explains 
pretty much all the political history.

740
00:34:56,000 --> 00:35:01,000
And I closed that.
I thought that explains more than 

741
00:35:01,761 --> 00:35:03,410
practically any other book I've ever 
read.

742
00:35:03,770 --> 00:35:06,470
And so I began to,
began to explore this.

743
00:35:06,710 --> 00:35:10,850
I understood the left together.
I understood Marxism.

744
00:35:10,851 --> 00:35:11,450
I mean,
those were,

745
00:35:11,690 --> 00:35:13,160
those were our professors,
right?

746
00:35:14,660 --> 00:35:16,210
Um,
and they're annoying.

747
00:35:16,380 --> 00:35:21,380
Uh,
but what I did not understand was the 

748
00:35:21,380 --> 00:35:21,710
right who galleon ism and what that,
what that tradition looks like.

749
00:35:21,711 --> 00:35:24,610
It's the throne.
And alter this,

750
00:35:24,700 --> 00:35:29,700
this historic view that the nation 
should constitute its own unit of 

751
00:35:31,970 --> 00:35:33,870
profound integrity,
uh,

752
00:35:34,220 --> 00:35:35,960
that,
that is more important than the,

753
00:35:36,020 --> 00:35:41,020
than the individual.
And that commercial society was too 

754
00:35:41,020 --> 00:35:41,020
chaotic,
that it,

755
00:35:41,030 --> 00:35:42,310
that,
that it was leading us,

756
00:35:42,340 --> 00:35:47,340
giving us the wrong kind of progress,
that it was flattening out the 

757
00:35:47,340 --> 00:35:50,280
hierarchies that we need to have an 
orderly life,

758
00:35:50,370 --> 00:35:50,640
right?

759
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:53,760
This is,
this is the right who galleon pitch that

760
00:35:53,761 --> 00:35:57,780
ultimately by mid 20th century becomes 
this very dangerous,

761
00:35:57,810 --> 00:35:59,730
dangerous movement in Europe,
you know,

762
00:36:00,390 --> 00:36:03,390
um,
became catastrophic,

763
00:36:04,140 --> 00:36:09,140
uh,
but it gradually emerged from all the 

764
00:36:09,140 --> 00:36:09,600
way from,
from Hagle because,

765
00:36:09,601 --> 00:36:13,020
uh,
this is at the end of the endless,

766
00:36:13,050 --> 00:36:15,040
seemingly endless Franco pressure 
awards.

767
00:36:15,041 --> 00:36:16,980
There's this battle of the battle of 
Jenna that,

768
00:36:17,550 --> 00:36:22,550
that Germany lost.
And the explanation for that was that 

769
00:36:22,550 --> 00:36:23,560
was a temporary setback.
That history,

770
00:36:23,561 --> 00:36:27,480
it was going to determine that Germany 
would rise just despite,

771
00:36:27,990 --> 00:36:31,620
despite the choices and individual's 
history has got its wind.

772
00:36:31,660 --> 00:36:34,040
It's like a Meta narrative that,
that,

773
00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:39,200
that was going to override everything.
Hegel himself was a theologian by the 

774
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:39,200
way.
Um,

775
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:40,110
and,
and so this,

776
00:36:40,140 --> 00:36:44,970
this view began to kind of spread 
throughout German academia and it was,

777
00:36:45,060 --> 00:36:48,450
it ended up being important to the 
United States through,

778
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:51,180
through circuitous means,
but what,

779
00:36:51,220 --> 00:36:54,610
but one of the great theorists of the,
of the team forties,

780
00:36:54,611 --> 00:36:59,611
who am 18 fifties,
who brought the suit to the United 

781
00:36:59,611 --> 00:37:02,210
States was Frederick List,
who was one of the first economist to 

782
00:37:02,210 --> 00:37:03,740
repudiate the free trade tradition of,
of,

783
00:37:03,770 --> 00:37:06,390
of the Smithian a Manchester Rights.

784
00:37:06,570 --> 00:37:08,640
And now we're celebrating the nation as 
a,

785
00:37:08,641 --> 00:37:10,980
as a unit,
as a productive power,

786
00:37:10,981 --> 00:37:12,000
uh,
and,

787
00:37:12,020 --> 00:37:15,000
and believed in tariff walls,
uh,

788
00:37:15,001 --> 00:37:17,370
which was strange and I've read his 
book,

789
00:37:17,450 --> 00:37:19,050
uh,
but,

790
00:37:19,080 --> 00:37:24,080
and that had a huge influence over 
American trade policy is actually the 

791
00:37:24,080 --> 00:37:25,290
late 19th century.
And,

792
00:37:25,890 --> 00:37:26,940
um,
and it,

793
00:37:26,941 --> 00:37:29,250
it began to flow out from there.
So Thomas,

794
00:37:29,251 --> 00:37:30,550
Carlyle,
and,

795
00:37:30,610 --> 00:37:35,610
and in Britain now begins to celebrate 
the great man theory of history.

796
00:37:36,360 --> 00:37:39,690
And really we're nothing without 
Napoleon,

797
00:37:39,691 --> 00:37:44,691
without,
without gigantic figures that we can 

798
00:37:44,691 --> 00:37:47,751
worship at Meijer.
And individuality should be subsumed 

799
00:37:47,751 --> 00:37:48,720
within them.
They act for us,

800
00:37:49,140 --> 00:37:50,280
God like,
you know,

801
00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:51,390
and,
and,

802
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:54,990
and it was Thomas Carlyle who first 
coined the phrase,

803
00:37:55,420 --> 00:38:00,420
I'm a coined the phrase to describe 
economics as being the dismal science.

804
00:38:02,580 --> 00:38:05,270
And the reason he said that is that 
every economist,

805
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:07,890
team new,
imagined a world without slavery,

806
00:38:09,060 --> 00:38:11,100
and he said you to have a website 
slavery,

807
00:38:11,470 --> 00:38:15,270
that's a dreadful world without slaves,
you don't have masters,

808
00:38:15,630 --> 00:38:15,930
right?

809
00:38:16,070 --> 00:38:19,110
And we need a world with masters and 
slaves so we can,

810
00:38:19,500 --> 00:38:22,470
we can have a vision of hierarchy and 
greatness without that,

811
00:38:22,471 --> 00:38:25,560
we don't have greatness.
So we began to see this building of this

812
00:38:25,561 --> 00:38:28,330
intellectual apparatus that was not left
to galleon.

813
00:38:28,331 --> 00:38:31,560
There wasn't Marxist,
Anti Marxist in a strange way,

814
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:33,810
but as an alternative form of 
collectivism,

815
00:38:34,200 --> 00:38:34,890
uh,
it,

816
00:38:34,891 --> 00:38:39,891
it began with a kind of historicism and 
a celebration on nationalism with a 

817
00:38:39,891 --> 00:38:40,570
German stayed,
began to grow with this,

818
00:38:40,580 --> 00:38:42,760
this,
this alternative theory of trade that we

819
00:38:42,761 --> 00:38:44,380
should,
we should build up tariff walls.

820
00:38:44,620 --> 00:38:48,160
And Carlisle with his,
with his great man theory of history.

821
00:38:48,370 --> 00:38:49,480
And then,
and then,

822
00:38:49,500 --> 00:38:54,500
uh,
Rueskin and Britain with his haste hate 

823
00:38:54,500 --> 00:38:57,160
hatred of Commercial Society because 
they believed that somehow a commerce 

824
00:38:57,160 --> 00:39:01,531
which ruined in quality and culture and 
was giving us mass production and by we 

825
00:39:01,531 --> 00:39:03,810
all need to be really doing this is,
is a,

826
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:08,920
uh,
living in guilds and making our own 

827
00:39:08,920 --> 00:39:08,920
stuff,
you know,

828
00:39:08,920 --> 00:39:10,060
because we're going to destroy English 
life and English country life.

829
00:39:10,060 --> 00:39:13,210
And so,
so a full scale reactionary trend on the

830
00:39:13,211 --> 00:39:18,211
right began to develop.
And it was always a racial element to 

831
00:39:18,211 --> 00:39:20,180
know.
So that's what's interesting.

832
00:39:20,210 --> 00:39:22,420
I'm so glad you asked that because it 
comes about,

833
00:39:22,421 --> 00:39:23,130
first of all,
through,

834
00:39:23,170 --> 00:39:27,460
through nationalism now and the end,
the early 18,

835
00:39:27,461 --> 00:39:28,560
20,018
thirties,

836
00:39:28,600 --> 00:39:31,960
this celebration of nationalist.
Now you have to ask yourself,

837
00:39:31,990 --> 00:39:36,250
what is a nation?
What do we mean when we say nation?

838
00:39:37,300 --> 00:39:39,550
And,
and I'm taking this,

839
00:39:39,610 --> 00:39:43,300
a lot of this from a,
from a,

840
00:39:43,490 --> 00:39:48,490
uh,
an essay gave it given to 1882 by Aaron 

841
00:39:48,490 --> 00:39:49,850
ran in a great French historian,
uh,

842
00:39:50,140 --> 00:39:55,140
looking back at the rise of nationalism.
So there's only five ways you can 

843
00:39:55,140 --> 00:39:56,160
consider nationalism.
You consider,

844
00:39:56,220 --> 00:39:57,790
uh,
the geographic definition,

845
00:39:57,791 --> 00:40:00,250
so we're just living in this space.
There's a dynastic element.

846
00:40:00,251 --> 00:40:04,990
We can all trace our lineage back to the
great founders of our nation.

847
00:40:05,010 --> 00:40:06,730
There is a language theory of 
nationalism.

848
00:40:06,731 --> 00:40:11,731
We all speak the same language.
There's a religious theory of 

849
00:40:11,731 --> 00:40:12,520
nationalism all worship a god and a 
precisely the same way.

850
00:40:12,521 --> 00:40:17,521
I believe in transubstantiation.
You believe in consubstantiation we 

851
00:40:17,521 --> 00:40:17,521
can't be part of the same nation and 
that gates.

852
00:40:17,521 --> 00:40:19,240
Right?
And then finally,

853
00:40:19,450 --> 00:40:21,730
and probably most insidiously,
there was a racial,

854
00:40:21,930 --> 00:40:26,930
the racial view,
and that came along and essentially the 

855
00:40:26,930 --> 00:40:31,321
18,
sixties and seventies with a 

856
00:40:31,321 --> 00:40:33,820
misapplication of Darwinian theory and 
scientific racism came along.

857
00:40:33,880 --> 00:40:37,810
And that's wet through academia,
particularly in the United States,

858
00:40:37,811 --> 00:40:42,811
like nothing you've ever seen.
It was absolutely astonishing how much 

859
00:40:42,941 --> 00:40:47,250
racism with Orthodoxy and American 
academia in the 1890 [inaudible],

860
00:40:47,251 --> 00:40:52,251
some of the very first monograph 
published by the American Economic 

861
00:40:52,780 --> 00:40:53,380
Economic Association,
Black Gay man,

862
00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:58,440
I think his name is Andre Hoffman,
was called race traits of the American 

863
00:40:58,440 --> 00:41:00,850
Negro.
And the first chapter dress goes all in.

864
00:41:01,030 --> 00:41:01,660
You know,
it's,

865
00:41:01,661 --> 00:41:04,630
it's,
it's the horror of the black people that

866
00:41:04,631 --> 00:41:06,030
don't have the right values,
that can't,

867
00:41:06,390 --> 00:41:08,050
can't save money,
they're just terrible.

868
00:41:08,310 --> 00:41:12,410
A shiftless and lazy and ghastly and 
uncivilized,

869
00:41:12,411 --> 00:41:13,420
double.
And now chapter two,

870
00:41:13,421 --> 00:41:15,250
the Jews,
you know,

871
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:17,650
these people,
I don't know what they've got this crazy

872
00:41:17,680 --> 00:41:20,650
out of control commercial ethic.
They can't stop hoarding money.

873
00:41:23,650 --> 00:41:25,030
They really went for it.
Yeah.

874
00:41:25,031 --> 00:41:27,730
And then the third chapter three is the 
slots and so on.

875
00:41:27,731 --> 00:41:29,620
And so the American Economic 
Association,

876
00:41:29,621 --> 00:41:31,270
you know,
and then,

877
00:41:31,300 --> 00:41:33,510
uh,
and there was essentially no,

878
00:41:33,560 --> 00:41:35,510
what do you think was happening in the 
world there?

879
00:41:35,511 --> 00:41:37,220
That it was taking a time,
what was happening,

880
00:41:37,240 --> 00:41:42,240
David Laissez faire had transformed 
society so dramatically that the 

881
00:41:44,450 --> 00:41:49,450
intellectuals felt that they had lost 
control and now you might think that 

882
00:41:49,450 --> 00:41:53,951
when the world becomes massively 
prosperous and we suddenly have cities 

883
00:41:53,951 --> 00:41:57,911
rising up and we've got steel that 
transversing large bodies of water and 

884
00:41:57,911 --> 00:42:00,280
we're developing the telephone and 
indoor electricity and,

885
00:42:00,281 --> 00:42:03,860
and people are living longer lives and,
and so much wealth is being created that

886
00:42:03,861 --> 00:42:05,950
everybody was data per say.
Hooray.

887
00:42:06,100 --> 00:42:11,100
We found the answers,
but the gatekeepers who had controlled 

888
00:42:11,100 --> 00:42:14,321
everything for so long.
So that's so interesting because of 

889
00:42:14,321 --> 00:42:16,910
revolt.
This is sort of what it feels like now 

890
00:42:16,910 --> 00:42:16,910
to me,
the gatekeepers,

891
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:18,320
we've had so much success.

892
00:42:18,320 --> 00:42:23,320
There's so many,
there's so many reasons right now to 

893
00:42:23,320 --> 00:42:25,010
understand how great everything is.
That book right there by Steven Pinker,

894
00:42:25,040 --> 00:42:30,040
enlightened misery is all about how 
great things are and how grateful we 

895
00:42:30,040 --> 00:42:32,280
are.
There is less violence now and all sorts

896
00:42:32,281 --> 00:42:37,281
of the.
And so the revolt you always have to be 

897
00:42:37,281 --> 00:42:39,791
on like the gatekeepers are having when 
the narrative intellectuals or what 

898
00:42:39,791 --> 00:42:41,900
Deirdre mccloskey calls the clerisy,
right?

899
00:42:41,901 --> 00:42:46,901
So it's the high end intellectuals,
it's the power elite bureaucrats and the

900
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:50,480
public,
the permanent peace keepers of our civic

901
00:42:50,481 --> 00:42:51,230
culture.
You know,

902
00:42:51,231 --> 00:42:53,150
it's,
it's the political class.

903
00:42:53,420 --> 00:42:55,780
And uh,
so this is sorta what for,

904
00:42:55,820 --> 00:42:58,440
for my audience that maybe not follow 
this.

905
00:42:58,460 --> 00:43:01,230
This is sort of what the New York Times 
is sort of like.

906
00:43:01,740 --> 00:43:02,930
Yeah,
maybe I shouldn't have said it.

907
00:43:02,931 --> 00:43:05,210
So obviously.
But like that's kind of what it is.

908
00:43:05,211 --> 00:43:07,250
Like that class,
the ruling class,

909
00:43:07,720 --> 00:43:10,460
the ruling class,
and they were in full scale revolted.

910
00:43:10,700 --> 00:43:13,790
They did not like what was happening to 
the world and the 18,

911
00:43:13,791 --> 00:43:15,950
eighties and nineties because of the 
loss of control.

912
00:43:16,310 --> 00:43:21,310
And so the,
the scientific racism came along to add 

913
00:43:21,310 --> 00:43:24,371
to the celebration of dictatorship and 
the and the and protectionism and the 

914
00:43:24,471 --> 00:43:29,471
new nationalism to add a very insidious 
element which culminated in eugenics 

915
00:43:30,351 --> 00:43:33,770
ideology.
And that's when it gets very strange.

916
00:43:33,771 --> 00:43:38,771
And this is where,
this is where the reading gets very 

917
00:43:38,771 --> 00:43:38,960
difficult because now you're reading all
the way into a,

918
00:43:39,340 --> 00:43:39,760
you know,
the,

919
00:43:39,800 --> 00:43:44,800
the,
the 19th tens with the works of Oswald 

920
00:43:44,800 --> 00:43:44,800
Spangler,
you know,

921
00:43:44,800 --> 00:43:48,430
the,
the right who galleon German theorist 

922
00:43:48,430 --> 00:43:48,430
that enraptured every American,
you,

923
00:43:48,430 --> 00:43:49,610
they're all reading his book,
Oh my God,

924
00:43:50,030 --> 00:43:55,030
the decline of the West.
We better reconstitute ourselves as the 

925
00:43:55,030 --> 00:43:56,420
tribe or we're going to be eaten alive 
by another four.

926
00:43:57,290 --> 00:44:00,020
And then there's a strain of that that's
still going on right now.

927
00:44:00,710 --> 00:44:02,540
There is nothing new,
you know,

928
00:44:02,541 --> 00:44:03,330
like,
um,

929
00:44:03,410 --> 00:44:04,090
and you know,
the,

930
00:44:04,100 --> 00:44:09,100
this,
this very funny book called the passing 

931
00:44:09,100 --> 00:44:11,561
of the great race by Madison grant that 
was on every coffee table in the late 19

932
00:44:14,901 --> 00:44:16,580
teens and early 19th,
20th,

933
00:44:16,610 --> 00:44:17,100
you know,
was,

934
00:44:17,400 --> 00:44:19,740
was forecasting doom for the white race,
you know,

935
00:44:19,760 --> 00:44:22,100
when he was,
he was a fascinating figure because,

936
00:44:22,640 --> 00:44:23,540
um,
you know,

937
00:44:23,541 --> 00:44:25,940
of course I've read his book as,
as it everybody did.

938
00:44:26,300 --> 00:44:28,880
Everybody a great gatsby makes a passing
reference to it.

939
00:44:28,881 --> 00:44:31,010
It was that popular,
it was that popular.

940
00:44:31,020 --> 00:44:35,190
And I tell you there's not a single 
outright racist alive today who hasn't,

941
00:44:35,191 --> 00:44:38,010
is not repeating those cliches that were
written by Madison.

942
00:44:38,011 --> 00:44:43,011
Grant is all pseudoscience is all just 
nonsense and it's just ridiculous and 

943
00:44:43,011 --> 00:44:43,011
embarrassing.
But,

944
00:44:43,011 --> 00:44:45,330
but it keeps being resurrected.
But here's what's interesting,

945
00:44:45,570 --> 00:44:50,570
he was a thoroughgoing a Darwinian 
because she recall that Darwin had two 

946
00:44:52,260 --> 00:44:53,790
great books,
origin these pieces.

947
00:44:53,790 --> 00:44:58,790
The other was called the descent of man.
And the descent of man had the very 

948
00:44:58,790 --> 00:45:00,240
unfortunate paragraph in there where he 
gret regrets,

949
00:45:00,670 --> 00:45:03,600
um,
the invention of mass,

950
00:45:03,680 --> 00:45:05,660
a disease killing a,
uh,

951
00:45:06,020 --> 00:45:11,020
a juror's essentially.
It's like if we keep curing people and 

952
00:45:11,020 --> 00:45:15,411
we keep feeding a inferior people and 
curing disease than then our genetic 

953
00:45:15,810 --> 00:45:17,880
stocks going to go down and down,
you know,

954
00:45:17,881 --> 00:45:20,430
so,
so they are all kind of playing off this

955
00:45:20,460 --> 00:45:23,300
little passage,
but Madison grant was,

956
00:45:23,330 --> 00:45:27,450
was not an unusual by American x to 
academic standards at all.

957
00:45:27,451 --> 00:45:28,050
They,
they.

958
00:45:28,051 --> 00:45:29,950
This was orthodox in the 18,
10,

959
00:45:30,070 --> 00:45:33,090
19 twenties.
What made Madison Grant Interesting?

960
00:45:33,091 --> 00:45:35,760
You can look up his wikipedia entry 
right now.

961
00:45:36,220 --> 00:45:37,110
Uh,
if you look it up,

962
00:45:37,111 --> 00:45:38,820
it'll,
it'll celebrate him as the,

963
00:45:38,910 --> 00:45:40,920
as the father of the National Park 
Service.

964
00:45:44,130 --> 00:45:45,420
Well,
in the course of my research,

965
00:45:45,430 --> 00:45:48,930
I wondered to know what is the 
connection between Madison's grants,

966
00:45:49,080 --> 00:45:54,080
hardcore,
eugenics based racism and its 

967
00:45:54,080 --> 00:45:56,220
environmental design.
What is the relationship there?

968
00:45:56,370 --> 00:45:57,660
Remember,
it's not just two people.

969
00:45:57,661 --> 00:46:00,340
Usually people have,
have it figured out in their own head.

970
00:46:00,341 --> 00:46:02,280
So I went through and read some of his 
works on,

971
00:46:02,360 --> 00:46:07,360
on the environment.
It turns out that he had a master race 

972
00:46:07,360 --> 00:46:11,001
theory of nature and he went to the 
California redwoods and he looked at 

973
00:46:11,001 --> 00:46:14,601
these glorious mighty trees and he was 
horrified to see they're being cut down 

974
00:46:14,601 --> 00:46:14,601
for,
for,

975
00:46:14,601 --> 00:46:19,490
for,
for making coffee tables and boats and 

976
00:46:19,490 --> 00:46:22,101
things like that.
And you thought it was this gigantic to 

977
00:46:22,101 --> 00:46:22,200
nature.
So he wanted the master race,

978
00:46:22,230 --> 00:46:24,390
uh,
the California redwoods to,

979
00:46:24,430 --> 00:46:26,940
to be protected.
And that's that.

980
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:29,040
So that's why he started the national 
park service.

981
00:46:29,340 --> 00:46:34,340
And now the left heroism is as great as 
a great visionary environmentalist.

982
00:46:34,350 --> 00:46:38,950
But actually he was like a tree Nazi.
I don't know how else you want to go.

983
00:46:40,230 --> 00:46:45,230
It's very creepy stuff.
We don't have enough Nazi labels being 

984
00:46:45,230 --> 00:46:45,230
thrown around.
Now we're going to have tree nuts.

985
00:46:45,410 --> 00:46:47,670
I'm sure that already was nuts.
Um,

986
00:46:47,730 --> 00:46:52,730
but you know,
you can just march through the history 

987
00:46:52,730 --> 00:46:52,730
and it gets worse and worse.
And then to me,

988
00:46:52,730 --> 00:46:53,250
Dave,
it'll,

989
00:46:53,520 --> 00:46:55,650
it'll culminates in the works of Carl 
Schmidt,

990
00:46:56,370 --> 00:46:57,300
uh,
from the,

991
00:46:57,330 --> 00:47:02,330
from the late 19 thirties and his,
and his amazing book called the concept 

992
00:47:02,330 --> 00:47:06,291
of the political.
And if you'll give me just one quick 

993
00:47:06,291 --> 00:47:07,830
second to explain this,
because because you as a liberal need to

994
00:47:07,831 --> 00:47:11,220
read this book because it's the most 
passionate,

995
00:47:11,280 --> 00:47:16,280
I would say,
an even competent attack on liberalism 

996
00:47:16,280 --> 00:47:16,320
Britain in the 20th century.
Now,

997
00:47:16,380 --> 00:47:17,880
Carl Schmidt,
what's a jurist?

998
00:47:17,970 --> 00:47:20,670
A brilliant man and a philosopher and a 
hardcore Nazi.

999
00:47:21,240 --> 00:47:23,760
Okay.
He wasn't tried at Nuremberg.

1000
00:47:23,761 --> 00:47:25,860
He escaped.
I'm merely an intellectual.

1001
00:47:25,920 --> 00:47:26,520
Okay?
Sure.

1002
00:47:27,540 --> 00:47:31,560
His book concept of the political.
What's wrong with liberalism?

1003
00:47:31,561 --> 00:47:33,320
I tell you,
it's dull.

1004
00:47:33,970 --> 00:47:36,130
Nothing happens,
nothing dramatic.

1005
00:47:36,310 --> 00:47:39,070
There's nothing.
Just requires no courage whatsoever.

1006
00:47:39,071 --> 00:47:42,820
Liberalism is a life in which we all 
benefit from each other's presence.

1007
00:47:42,960 --> 00:47:45,160
We all just trade with each other.
What kind of life is that?

1008
00:47:45,940 --> 00:47:50,940
Where we all just are kind of the same 
and like each other and help backyard 

1009
00:47:50,940 --> 00:47:54,481
barbecues and baseball games and just 
get richer and live longer lives and 

1010
00:47:54,481 --> 00:47:54,700
send their kid to college.
This is terrible.

1011
00:47:55,300 --> 00:47:57,430
We need to live big,
dramatic,

1012
00:47:58,210 --> 00:47:59,770
mighty,
bold,

1013
00:47:59,800 --> 00:48:02,080
courageous,
transformative lives,

1014
00:48:02,230 --> 00:48:04,120
and live in times that,
that,

1015
00:48:04,240 --> 00:48:04,800
that,
that,

1016
00:48:04,920 --> 00:48:06,070
that,
that are shocking,

1017
00:48:06,100 --> 00:48:08,200
that are amazing,
that make our lives worth living.

1018
00:48:08,710 --> 00:48:13,710
That requires above all else politics.
Liberalism imagines a world without 

1019
00:48:14,081 --> 00:48:16,060
politics,
that's a terrifying world.

1020
00:48:16,060 --> 00:48:21,060
What we need is a world of politics and 
and he continues to lay it out chapter 

1021
00:48:21,191 --> 00:48:26,191
by chapter,
why we have to destroy liberalism and 

1022
00:48:26,191 --> 00:48:30,001
celebrate the concept of the political 
and for him that means having friends 

1023
00:48:30,970 --> 00:48:35,970
and having enemies,
defeating your enemies and rallying 

1024
00:48:35,970 --> 00:48:39,451
around your friends.
Now who are your friends and who your 

1025
00:48:39,451 --> 00:48:40,630
enemies and mode says at some level it 
doesn't matter.

1026
00:48:41,800 --> 00:48:44,650
What matters is that they exist and and 
the state,

1027
00:48:44,830 --> 00:48:47,170
the powerful men will choose them for 
us.

1028
00:48:47,290 --> 00:48:49,270
They will decide who our friends and our
enemies are.

1029
00:48:49,271 --> 00:48:51,160
Now let's be clear what we mean by 
enemy.

1030
00:48:51,460 --> 00:48:53,080
I don't stop me in somebody you don't 
like.

1031
00:48:53,530 --> 00:48:58,530
I mean the willingness to kill.
There has to be the presence of real 

1032
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:04,650
bloodshed in your time.
For you to have a sufficiently prescient

1033
00:49:04,660 --> 00:49:09,660
sense of enemies so that you'll feel the
intense desire to rally around your fin 

1034
00:49:10,540 --> 00:49:12,730
for your friends and experienced that.

1035
00:49:13,120 --> 00:49:14,200
That the,
the,

1036
00:49:14,290 --> 00:49:17,230
the awesomeness that only comes with 
belonging to a group.

1037
00:49:17,750 --> 00:49:19,450
So,
so he says,

1038
00:49:19,510 --> 00:49:20,280
so he,
at the end,

1039
00:49:20,310 --> 00:49:24,030
the end feeling there is that you can't 
achieve what,

1040
00:49:24,070 --> 00:49:27,020
what the real purpose of a humanist.
That's right,

1041
00:49:27,160 --> 00:49:32,160
that you can experience whatever,
the highs of belongingness essentially 

1042
00:49:33,561 --> 00:49:38,561
and,
and the life of drama that a big 

1043
00:49:38,561 --> 00:49:38,630
important life without being part of a 
kind of a,

1044
00:49:38,700 --> 00:49:41,010
a group on the move,
the slaughtering of center.

1045
00:49:41,050 --> 00:49:43,270
And so we have to have the presence of 
bloodshed.

1046
00:49:43,390 --> 00:49:46,030
So it really is the opposite of live and
let live it is.

1047
00:49:46,031 --> 00:49:47,320
It's so through,
through,

1048
00:49:47,321 --> 00:49:49,780
through bloodshed comes life and 
without,

1049
00:49:49,781 --> 00:49:52,600
without bloodshed and death and violence
and politics,

1050
00:49:52,630 --> 00:49:55,750
then you're just gonna live at an 
irrelevant life and we can't have that.

1051
00:49:55,960 --> 00:49:59,500
So he was in many ways of philosophical 
architect of the Holocaust.

1052
00:50:00,340 --> 00:50:01,810
Again,
not a leftist,

1053
00:50:01,840 --> 00:50:03,610
not a Marxist,
although he dabbled in it.

1054
00:50:03,610 --> 00:50:08,610
You find that.
So from a lot of these right 

1055
00:50:08,610 --> 00:50:08,610
collectivists the writer galleons that 
they dabbled,

1056
00:50:08,610 --> 00:50:09,750
guys like verner,
sambar writings,

1057
00:50:09,760 --> 00:50:11,860
wants a communist who later became a 
Nazi.

1058
00:50:12,560 --> 00:50:15,280
Carl Schmitt dabbled in and leftism and 
then went full,

1059
00:50:15,281 --> 00:50:16,420
right?
Um,

1060
00:50:16,750 --> 00:50:21,750
and it,
it was in many ways the culmination to 

1061
00:50:21,750 --> 00:50:21,750
the right hand galleon ideology and the 
encroachment.

1062
00:50:21,750 --> 00:50:23,860
So it's a book worth reading and 
contemplating.

1063
00:50:24,400 --> 00:50:26,680
And I would say to anybody who rejects 
liberalism,

1064
00:50:28,560 --> 00:50:33,560
you know,
be honest about where you're going with 

1065
00:50:33,560 --> 00:50:33,560
this.
This is the opposite of liberalism,

1066
00:50:33,560 --> 00:50:35,950
the celebration of death and the quirks 
of Schmidt,

1067
00:50:36,620 --> 00:50:41,000
very powerful thinker,
highly regarded even today worth reading

1068
00:50:41,170 --> 00:50:43,700
and worth reflecting on what kind of 
world do want to live in.

1069
00:50:44,550 --> 00:50:49,550
Want to live in peace with others.
Where do you want to slaughter your 

1070
00:50:49,550 --> 00:50:53,381
friends,
slaughter your enemies and rally with 

1071
00:50:53,381 --> 00:50:55,001
your friends.
So move me from that point 19 thirties 

1072
00:50:55,001 --> 00:50:56,080
into,
of course,

1073
00:50:56,081 --> 00:50:59,170
obviously into Nazi Germany and then 
we'll,

1074
00:51:00,110 --> 00:51:00,760
we,
yeah.

1075
00:51:00,760 --> 00:51:01,690
And,
and you know,

1076
00:51:01,691 --> 00:51:04,120
my book really does end in 1958.
Not necessarily,

1077
00:51:04,121 --> 00:51:05,180
didn't have to,
but I,

1078
00:51:05,181 --> 00:51:08,620
I started to get really queasy about 
what happened after World War Two.

1079
00:51:08,890 --> 00:51:11,860
A lot of the writer galleon movement 
went underground,

1080
00:51:12,100 --> 00:51:13,590
you know,
um,

1081
00:51:13,710 --> 00:51:18,710
and,
and became a kind of a quiet neo Nazi 

1082
00:51:18,710 --> 00:51:20,830
movement that never really had access to
social media.

1083
00:51:20,831 --> 00:51:23,770
They clearly weren't in academia,
obviously.

1084
00:51:24,310 --> 00:51:27,640
And but the ideology never entirely went
away and,

1085
00:51:28,030 --> 00:51:29,530
and it was just lying in,
wait,

1086
00:51:29,620 --> 00:51:34,620
wait,
waiting for the failure of the left and 

1087
00:51:34,620 --> 00:51:37,531
for the resentment of the population 
against the left to rise up and receive 

1088
00:51:37,531 --> 00:51:41,980
a fevered enough pitch that it would,
it would then come on full force.

1089
00:51:41,981 --> 00:51:44,140
And that's really what's happening in 
Europe.

1090
00:51:44,530 --> 00:51:46,390
Russia,
United States,

1091
00:51:47,080 --> 00:51:49,390
it's an alternative form of 
collectivism,

1092
00:51:49,391 --> 00:51:54,391
has got a different flavor,
a different orientation at different 

1093
00:51:54,391 --> 00:51:58,111
kinds of resentments,
but it still drags in this gigantic 

1094
00:51:58,111 --> 00:51:59,770
history of writing Ghillean ideology.

1095
00:51:59,770 --> 00:52:03,130
That celebration of that Dick Great man 
dictated the protectionism,

1096
00:52:03,131 --> 00:52:05,330
the anti-immigration,
the nativism,

1097
00:52:05,360 --> 00:52:08,920
the nationalism that could take any one 
of five forms including the racism.

1098
00:52:09,590 --> 00:52:12,460
Um,
what do you make about how now?

1099
00:52:12,461 --> 00:52:14,380
And it's obviously largely because of 
the Internet,

1100
00:52:14,410 --> 00:52:17,650
it seems to be happening in so many 
places at once.

1101
00:52:17,830 --> 00:52:22,830
We're seeing this unholy.
It's an oddly unholy alliance between 

1102
00:52:22,830 --> 00:52:23,710
the collectivist left and then that 
drives,

1103
00:52:23,711 --> 00:52:24,760
I mean,
it's exactly what you're saying.

1104
00:52:24,940 --> 00:52:29,940
Then you've got this other data that's 
just waiting there for these guys to go 

1105
00:52:29,940 --> 00:52:29,940
to bananas.
And I was like,

1106
00:52:29,940 --> 00:52:30,430
ah,
we got all these answers.

1107
00:52:30,431 --> 00:52:32,880
Meanwhile,
you have the liberals and everyone,

1108
00:52:32,881 --> 00:52:37,881
all the decent 80 percent of us that are
trying to live in that part of it really

1109
00:52:38,231 --> 00:52:41,650
comes down to this.
There was a weird sociological,

1110
00:52:42,010 --> 00:52:45,640
cultural contradiction at the heart of 
social democratic leftist ideology.

1111
00:52:45,880 --> 00:52:50,880
On one hand they they wanted to build 
gigantic institutions that are 

1112
00:52:50,880 --> 00:52:55,081
redistributed Tori and we're supposed to
treat each other like a big family and 

1113
00:52:55,081 --> 00:52:59,401
we're supposed to have this homogeneous 
nation state and the other hand they're 

1114
00:52:59,401 --> 00:53:02,501
celebrating diversity and encouraging 
mass immigration and heterogeneous 

1115
00:53:02,501 --> 00:53:04,540
populations and guests,
but those don't really work together.

1116
00:53:05,110 --> 00:53:09,590
So you build gigantic institute,
gigantic states that presumed sort of.

1117
00:53:09,980 --> 00:53:13,510
We're all one family and then you throw 
in this,

1118
00:53:13,530 --> 00:53:15,400
this,
this diverse set of people,

1119
00:53:15,401 --> 00:53:20,401
especially with the refugee crisis in 
Europe and immigration in the United 

1120
00:53:20,401 --> 00:53:20,401
States and people are looking around 
going down,

1121
00:53:20,401 --> 00:53:25,330
these people are my family.
I don't even like these and yet I'm 

1122
00:53:25,330 --> 00:53:26,820
paying for them and that is A.
I mean that that blows up.

1123
00:53:26,880 --> 00:53:27,720
I'm.
That's a disaster.

1124
00:53:27,721 --> 00:53:32,721
It's a powder keg and so is the left and
there's this core contradiction that 

1125
00:53:32,721 --> 00:53:36,550
they have between on a welfare state.
On one hand and their celebration,

1126
00:53:36,610 --> 00:53:40,320
Hetero heterogeneous populations on the 
other welfare state and diversity,

1127
00:53:40,950 --> 00:53:42,540
they don't,
they don't work.

1128
00:53:42,570 --> 00:53:45,360
And that basically puts us where Germany
sort of is at right now,

1129
00:53:45,490 --> 00:53:46,410
right where they said,
okay,

1130
00:53:46,411 --> 00:53:51,411
3 million people come on in now all 
these people are going to have to pay 

1131
00:53:51,411 --> 00:53:51,411
for you.

1132
00:53:51,411 --> 00:53:51,411
We're not going to integrate you 
properly.

1133
00:53:51,411 --> 00:53:56,090
I mean this is not only to identitarian 
movements rising up in Germany and in 

1134
00:53:56,090 --> 00:53:58,710
Hungary and of course in Russia and of 
course the US,

1135
00:53:58,770 --> 00:54:00,780
you know,
so it all just kind of follows.

1136
00:54:00,781 --> 00:54:01,800
It's,
it's inevitable.

1137
00:54:01,980 --> 00:54:03,600
The left created this.
I mean if,

1138
00:54:03,900 --> 00:54:08,900
if after World War Two,
we had just embraced liberalism by we 

1139
00:54:08,900 --> 00:54:08,900
should have,
we should have,

1140
00:54:08,900 --> 00:54:13,341
we wouldn't be where we are today,
but we have another chance and that's 

1141
00:54:13,341 --> 00:54:13,341
why you're here.
And that's why I'm here.

1142
00:54:13,341 --> 00:54:17,781
We have another chance now to re embrace
liberal liberal theory and to end to 

1143
00:54:18,211 --> 00:54:19,460
reject the left.
Right?

1144
00:54:19,461 --> 00:54:22,470
And don't feel yourself just because of 
the enemy of your enemy is,

1145
00:54:22,471 --> 00:54:27,471
is there.
It doesn't mean to ask to be your 

1146
00:54:27,471 --> 00:54:27,471
friend.
I mean,

1147
00:54:27,471 --> 00:54:29,900
we really do need to think of ourselves 
as kind of a distance from a political 

1148
00:54:29,900 --> 00:54:34,731
culture that,
that rally around freedom and human 

1149
00:54:35,371 --> 00:54:39,780
rights and universal human rights and,
and the enablement of humanity,

1150
00:54:39,781 --> 00:54:42,460
the champion of the common person,
uh,

1151
00:54:42,720 --> 00:54:46,020
the rights of everyone to live freely 
with each other,

1152
00:54:46,021 --> 00:54:51,021
to,
to gain value from each other and to 

1153
00:54:51,021 --> 00:54:52,941
live in peace and stop thinking of our,
of our fellow human beings as possible 

1154
00:54:52,941 --> 00:54:52,941
enemies.

1155
00:54:52,941 --> 00:54:56,940
We don't want to get drafted into this 
political world that Carl Schmitt.

1156
00:54:56,941 --> 00:54:59,210
Imagine for us,
as I was describing crossfit you,

1157
00:54:59,400 --> 00:55:00,870
you see it happening,
right?

1158
00:55:01,240 --> 00:55:06,240
That Schmidt,
Ian View to slice and dice the 

1159
00:55:06,240 --> 00:55:06,240
population.
Who Do you like?

1160
00:55:06,240 --> 00:55:07,320
Who Do you hate?
You know,

1161
00:55:07,350 --> 00:55:08,670
who,
who are your people?

1162
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:10,920
It's,
this is not a good life.

1163
00:55:10,940 --> 00:55:15,940
Yeah.
And we feel it chopping away at both 

1164
00:55:15,940 --> 00:55:15,940
sides,
right?

1165
00:55:15,940 --> 00:55:15,940
Yeah,
we do.

1166
00:55:15,940 --> 00:55:15,940
We feel it.
And so we don't,

1167
00:55:15,940 --> 00:55:18,480
I just don't feel like we have to be 
part of it as best we can.

1168
00:55:18,940 --> 00:55:21,180
Uh,
let's find things we love,

1169
00:55:21,890 --> 00:55:24,210
you know,
and go places we love me with people who

1170
00:55:24,211 --> 00:55:27,380
love of all different backgrounds,
all different kinds of cultures,

1171
00:55:27,650 --> 00:55:31,560
learn about alternative religions or 
learn about new ways to do things.

1172
00:55:31,561 --> 00:55:34,590
Travel right.
And the age of liberalism.

1173
00:55:34,591 --> 00:55:36,540
There were no such things as passports,
you know.

1174
00:55:37,420 --> 00:55:38,520
All right,
so let's,

1175
00:55:38,840 --> 00:55:43,840
let's spend the last portion here on,
on just these last five years really 

1176
00:55:43,840 --> 00:55:45,520
here in America because I remember just 
even,

1177
00:55:45,521 --> 00:55:46,710
it doesn't have to be the last five 
years,

1178
00:55:46,711 --> 00:55:51,060
but let's say even three years ago,
just it's sort of the emergence of trump

1179
00:55:51,061 --> 00:55:54,240
as a candidate when people started 
saying the phrase,

1180
00:55:54,241 --> 00:55:55,050
all right.

1181
00:55:55,090 --> 00:56:00,090
Yeah,
and I did a bunch of videos on it where 

1182
00:56:00,090 --> 00:56:03,171
I was basically saying I see two strains
to this thing and people are now using 

1183
00:56:03,171 --> 00:56:06,540
this video against me.
And what I saw was there was the sort of

1184
00:56:06,541 --> 00:56:11,070
fun me makers and the.
I know all of the people who were having

1185
00:56:11,071 --> 00:56:15,470
fun online doing often doing awful 
things and Nazi imagery just to,

1186
00:56:15,570 --> 00:56:17,880
to,
to upset people in power and whatever.

1187
00:56:17,881 --> 00:56:20,130
But sometimes it's very fun things too.
And funny things,

1188
00:56:20,370 --> 00:56:23,980
but I saw it like just the real sort of 
shit posters they're known in the

1189
00:56:24,140 --> 00:56:26,380
gay people.
The whole idea was we could get,

1190
00:56:26,500 --> 00:56:31,500
we can start sending a frog to some like
intellectual and they're going to think 

1191
00:56:31,500 --> 00:56:31,980
that's a racist thing.
And then they would,

1192
00:56:32,180 --> 00:56:34,530
they would say I'm being under attack 
from racist.

1193
00:56:34,960 --> 00:56:36,920
They would actually give them exactly 
what they wanted.

1194
00:56:37,150 --> 00:56:42,150
So I saw this,
this sort of fun shit posting whatever 

1195
00:56:42,150 --> 00:56:45,181
part of it.
Not to say it didn't have elements I 

1196
00:56:45,181 --> 00:56:45,181
didn't like,
but there were,

1197
00:56:45,181 --> 00:56:48,100
I saw that as the bulk of it.
And then alongside of that was this,

1198
00:56:48,130 --> 00:56:50,120
that you're talking about the 
identitarian part,

1199
00:56:50,140 --> 00:56:55,140
the true racist part,
the part that had been sort of 

1200
00:56:55,140 --> 00:56:58,741
underground for a long time and then 
because of social media now is finding 

1201
00:56:58,741 --> 00:57:01,540
that it could actually influence people 
and beat it up.

1202
00:57:01,560 --> 00:57:01,870
Well,
okay.

1203
00:57:01,871 --> 00:57:03,820
So those.
And now and you know,

1204
00:57:03,821 --> 00:57:08,821
and I think the media really fueled both
of those things because basically when 

1205
00:57:08,821 --> 00:57:10,890
Hillary said that deplorables comment,
she,

1206
00:57:10,960 --> 00:57:13,570
she just lumped the whole damn thing 
together.

1207
00:57:13,690 --> 00:57:18,690
And I think if she had not said that,
I think it's very possible she be 

1208
00:57:18,690 --> 00:57:21,961
president anyhow.
And she helped the country almost made 

1209
00:57:21,961 --> 00:57:22,990
they'll write exists.
So it was what my question really is.

1210
00:57:22,991 --> 00:57:25,150
How would you just define the alt right 
flat out,

1211
00:57:25,151 --> 00:57:30,151
if I asked you right now,
because I think the definition has 

1212
00:57:30,151 --> 00:57:32,761
changed and has it.
But if I asked you right now in the 

1213
00:57:32,761 --> 00:57:33,540
summer of 2018 to definition,
so you know,

1214
00:57:33,630 --> 00:57:34,200
the,
the,

1215
00:57:34,201 --> 00:57:35,320
the phrase.
All right,

1216
00:57:35,321 --> 00:57:36,850
comes about what,
10 years ago,

1217
00:57:36,851 --> 00:57:38,690
I think it was coined by,
by Paul God prayed,

1218
00:57:38,740 --> 00:57:40,750
who himself as a follower of Carl 
Schmidt,

1219
00:57:41,550 --> 00:57:42,380
um,
I,

1220
00:57:42,381 --> 00:57:45,960
I would rather look at this as a,
as,

1221
00:57:45,970 --> 00:57:48,100
as a writer,
Galleon collectivist movement,

1222
00:57:48,220 --> 00:57:49,600
you know,
and in general,

1223
00:57:49,601 --> 00:57:54,601
that stretches from the early 19th 
century all the way up to the present 

1224
00:57:54,601 --> 00:57:55,560
that's characterized by love of 
dictatorship.

1225
00:57:55,561 --> 00:57:58,360
I love of power,
protectionist trade policy,

1226
00:57:58,390 --> 00:58:01,540
nativist immigration policy,
and an,

1227
00:58:01,640 --> 00:58:03,580
and a resentment against commercial 
life.

1228
00:58:03,581 --> 00:58:05,340
Because it's because it's,
it's,

1229
00:58:05,430 --> 00:58:08,050
it's too heterogeneous.
Intuit and noble enough humanity.

1230
00:58:08,051 --> 00:58:08,370
I mean,
that's,

1231
00:58:09,220 --> 00:58:12,820
to me the alt right is one species.
I guess you could say one flavoring,

1232
00:58:12,880 --> 00:58:14,830
one instanciation

1233
00:58:15,170 --> 00:58:17,900
have a much larger problem that 
stretches way back,

1234
00:58:17,901 --> 00:58:22,370
which isn't in liberal theory of,
of life in illiberal theory of,

1235
00:58:22,490 --> 00:58:23,150
of,
um,

1236
00:58:23,630 --> 00:58:24,350
of,
uh,

1237
00:58:24,380 --> 00:58:26,120
politics.
So that's,

1238
00:58:26,121 --> 00:58:31,121
I think the right way to think about it.
My first time I heard trump speak was 

1239
00:58:31,121 --> 00:58:34,810
July 2015 and I don't even think we were
using the term right at the time,

1240
00:58:35,750 --> 00:58:39,170
but he opened his speech with,
um,

1241
00:58:39,330 --> 00:58:40,790
immigrants are a problem.
I thought,

1242
00:58:40,910 --> 00:58:45,910
hmm.
Then there was protection of their 

1243
00:58:45,910 --> 00:58:45,910
foreign goods,
protectionist when do protection,

1244
00:58:45,910 --> 00:58:50,551
something like that.
It was third big point was I can fix 

1245
00:58:50,551 --> 00:58:53,201
everything.
This is all sounding strangely familiar 

1246
00:58:53,201 --> 00:58:53,201
to me,
you know,

1247
00:58:53,201 --> 00:58:57,970
that's,
that's like the three pillars of a 

1248
00:58:57,970 --> 00:58:58,280
writer Galleon ideology essentially.
And um,

1249
00:58:58,610 --> 00:59:00,440
I realized we had a problem and I 
understand.

1250
00:59:00,890 --> 00:59:04,190
I do where people had a high regard for 
him.

1251
00:59:04,250 --> 00:59:09,250
He was going to save us from,
from the problems that Obama had 

1252
00:59:09,250 --> 00:59:09,250
created.

1253
00:59:09,250 --> 00:59:12,950
And God knows those problems and the 
left has gotten just bonkers,

1254
00:59:13,010 --> 00:59:14,900
right?
So we need,

1255
00:59:14,960 --> 00:59:19,960
we need protection from that.
But he introduced his own form of 

1256
00:59:19,960 --> 00:59:20,570
problems in the unleashed it's own form 
of,

1257
00:59:20,620 --> 00:59:25,620
of dangerous and and potential punch.
Essentially despotic arrangements of 

1258
00:59:25,731 --> 00:59:30,731
power and in some ways are more 
insidious because they appealed to 

1259
00:59:30,731 --> 00:59:34,270
bourgeoisie.
The left has always been a little bit 

1260
00:59:34,270 --> 00:59:35,900
culturally estranged,
you know,

1261
00:59:35,960 --> 00:59:38,180
from,
from the mainstream of American life.

1262
00:59:38,540 --> 00:59:41,330
Whereas trump connects very closely with
it.

1263
00:59:41,360 --> 00:59:45,440
This is why fascist movements have been 
oftentimes much more successful than the

1264
00:59:45,441 --> 00:59:46,730
left socialist once.
Wait,

1265
00:59:46,731 --> 00:59:49,400
I gotta I gotta get this because I would
have thought the opposite.

1266
00:59:49,401 --> 00:59:54,401
So if you,
if you would have asked me before you 

1267
00:59:54,401 --> 00:59:56,141
said that,
I would say the left is the one that is 

1268
00:59:56,141 --> 00:59:57,971
understood the culture part of this,
at least in the American piece of they 

1269
00:59:58,161 --> 01:00:01,700
certainly academia and culture,
what you could and couldn't joke about.

1270
01:00:02,600 --> 01:00:05,120
Culture.
The left is as high.

1271
01:00:05,330 --> 01:00:10,330
You know,
socialist ideology never came from 

1272
01:00:10,330 --> 01:00:10,330
below.
It was never working.

1273
01:00:10,330 --> 01:00:11,570
Man's philosophy,
it was always a mental.

1274
01:00:11,600 --> 01:00:16,600
I was always the intellectuals.
It was a top down rule was always the 

1275
01:00:16,600 --> 01:00:17,870
ruling class that hatched associates,
socialist ideology that never would have

1276
01:00:17,871 --> 01:00:19,760
been communism,
socialism,

1277
01:00:19,761 --> 01:00:21,530
all those things without the 
intellectual class.

1278
01:00:21,920 --> 01:00:25,220
But fascism,
if you'll allow me to use that term,

1279
01:00:25,500 --> 01:00:27,380
a kind of flip scenario to have a little
bit.

1280
01:00:27,381 --> 01:00:30,170
It's more,
it's much more of a from below it.

1281
01:00:30,190 --> 01:00:33,190
You can keep your religion,
you can keep your nationhood,

1282
01:00:33,210 --> 01:00:34,550
your identity,
your race,

1283
01:00:34,551 --> 01:00:36,770
your language,
rally around your friends,

1284
01:00:37,190 --> 01:00:38,240
your family,
you know,

1285
01:00:38,241 --> 01:00:40,250
all the things that you believe are 
true.

1286
01:00:40,251 --> 01:00:41,810
You and,
and,

1287
01:00:41,830 --> 01:00:42,590
and,
and,

1288
01:00:42,620 --> 01:00:44,630
and,
and within me as a person,

1289
01:00:44,631 --> 01:00:45,530
as a leader,
I will,

1290
01:00:45,560 --> 01:00:50,560
I will embody all your values and,
and collected by as us in a way that 

1291
01:00:50,860 --> 01:00:54,650
that means something important that 
connects with who you are.

1292
01:00:55,010 --> 01:01:00,010
So in that sense,
it's a very effective way of being 

1293
01:01:00,010 --> 01:01:02,070
illiberal.
Alright?

1294
01:01:02,180 --> 01:01:07,180
So all that said,
what is our way out of this precarious 

1295
01:01:07,401 --> 01:01:12,401
position?
I think I get where I get the theme of 

1296
01:01:12,401 --> 01:01:15,851
what you're doing here is we have to 
just keep fighting for what we've been 

1297
01:01:15,851 --> 01:01:16,460
thinking better.
Well,

1298
01:01:16,461 --> 01:01:18,500
so dave,
I think we need to rethink who we are.

1299
01:01:18,501 --> 01:01:23,501
I think we need to deepen and enrich our
understanding of who we are and what 

1300
01:01:23,811 --> 01:01:26,870
we're here to do,
and it goes back centuries.

1301
01:01:27,050 --> 01:01:32,050
I mean it was the liberalism that dog is
out of feudalism that ended the guilds 

1302
01:01:32,930 --> 01:01:35,330
that brought us free trade,
that ended slavery,

1303
01:01:35,331 --> 01:01:40,331
that really gave birth to the modern 
world and we need to learn to take 

1304
01:01:40,331 --> 01:01:43,820
credit for that and make that ethos our 
ethos.

1305
01:01:44,320 --> 01:01:47,990
Go back and read the works of Adam Smith
and the Great Scottish,

1306
01:01:48,020 --> 01:01:49,460
Scottish enlightenment thinkers.

1307
01:01:49,460 --> 01:01:50,170
You know,
and,

1308
01:01:50,400 --> 01:01:53,420
and understand our history so we 
understand ourselves better.

1309
01:01:53,750 --> 01:01:58,750
I think this is important because we 
need to stop thinking of ourselves even 

1310
01:01:58,750 --> 01:01:58,750
though we are radicals.
I think you are.

1311
01:01:58,750 --> 01:02:02,951
I think I am.
I almost believe that we should stop 

1312
01:02:02,951 --> 01:02:03,980
thinking of ourselves that way.
We should think of ourselves as normal.

1313
01:02:04,940 --> 01:02:07,220
If I'm a radical,
then the phrase radical,

1314
01:02:07,221 --> 01:02:08,880
it's definitely not as cool as it used 
to be.

1315
01:02:09,040 --> 01:02:09,470
I mean,
I,

1316
01:02:09,480 --> 01:02:13,070
I think I'm open to these ideas and I 
guess being,

1317
01:02:13,340 --> 01:02:18,340
being open right now and being really 
living up to the ideals that you said 

1318
01:02:18,340 --> 01:02:18,880
fourth year.
He's,

1319
01:02:19,380 --> 01:02:24,380
these days it kind of is,
and maybe liberalism has always been a 

1320
01:02:24,380 --> 01:02:25,650
radical creed because it opposes power.
It always had been opposed to power.

1321
01:02:25,960 --> 01:02:30,960
That's where we have to do now,
but we also have to celebrate regular 

1322
01:02:30,960 --> 01:02:30,960
life.
You know,

1323
01:02:30,960 --> 01:02:30,960
we have to.

1324
01:02:30,960 --> 01:02:35,360
We have to celebrate the good life and 
the beautiful things and the things we 

1325
01:02:35,360 --> 01:02:39,711
love,
the people we love and the choices that 

1326
01:02:39,711 --> 01:02:39,711
we can make in the technologies that you
can use it.

1327
01:02:39,711 --> 01:02:42,000
I fall in love with the new technology.
Every single day I came over,

1328
01:02:42,270 --> 01:02:47,270
I came over to see you with this new 
funny pillow that I bought for $10 on 

1329
01:02:47,270 --> 01:02:49,200
Amazon and it allows me to sleep sitting
up and I'm been raptured.

1330
01:02:49,201 --> 01:02:51,930
But yeah,
I think this is the way to happiness and

1331
01:02:51,931 --> 01:02:56,160
I think ultimately is the path to 
political victory for us to to be,

1332
01:02:56,220 --> 01:02:59,130
to be more hopeful,
to be more cheerful,

1333
01:02:59,430 --> 01:03:03,600
to be more,
to celebrate life and celebrate love and

1334
01:03:03,601 --> 01:03:05,120
celebrate.
Wow.

1335
01:03:05,820 --> 01:03:08,280
In a way in which neither left or the 
right or doing right now.

1336
01:03:08,281 --> 01:03:13,281
It gives us as an opening to be awesome,
to emancipate the world.

1337
01:03:14,460 --> 01:03:19,460
We can do this.
I got nothing better to do for more 

1338
01:03:19,460 --> 01:03:19,460
ride.
