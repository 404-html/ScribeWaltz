1
00:00:02,610 --> 00:00:02,790
We

2
00:00:02,790 --> 00:00:04,920
spend a lot of time talking about the 
left around here,

3
00:00:04,921 --> 00:00:07,320
but this week we're going to be diving 
into the right.

4
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:10,620
My guest is conservative radio talk show
host,

5
00:00:10,621 --> 00:00:11,454
lawyer and writer Larry Elder.
Larry has written several books on 

6
00:00:14,701 --> 00:00:18,630
conservative principles with a focus on 
government and racial issues.

7
00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:22,650
Much of his work is very similar 
actually to the ideas we talk about here

8
00:00:22,651 --> 00:00:24,630
on the Rubin report,
including religion,

9
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:27,630
the role of government and personal 
responsibility.

10
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:28,793
According to his biography,
Larry uses facts and common sense to 

11
00:00:31,861 --> 00:00:35,070
arrive at his conclusions.
That sounds familiar right now.

12
00:00:35,071 --> 00:00:38,160
If I use those same precepts as a 
liberal,

13
00:00:38,190 --> 00:00:41,490
can we both be right at the same time?
Can both be wrong?

14
00:00:41,580 --> 00:00:43,620
Is the answer somewhere in the middle?
Well,

15
00:00:43,621 --> 00:00:45,660
that's exactly what we're going to try 
to find out.

16
00:00:45,810 --> 00:00:46,643
As I discussed with Don Lemon last week,
the media talks so much about the left 

17
00:00:49,591 --> 00:00:50,424
right divide in this country that it's 
easy to forget that there are decent 

18
00:00:52,921 --> 00:00:54,630
people on both sides of the debate.

19
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:58,710
This is one of the reasons I've taken 
the left to task so much on this show.

20
00:00:58,920 --> 00:00:59,753
The further off the deep end they go,
the less we'll be able to find 

21
00:01:02,131 --> 00:01:02,964
compromise with people we disagree with.
Just because I may have different views 

22
00:01:06,781 --> 00:01:10,350
on abortion than Republicans,
doesn't mean that they hate all women.

23
00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:11,573
Just because I may have different views 
than Republicans on guns doesn't mean 

24
00:01:14,161 --> 00:01:14,994
that there are a bunch of rednecks and 
just because Republicans aren't for 

25
00:01:17,761 --> 00:01:21,360
legalizing marijuana doesn't mean they 
aren't fun to hang out with.

26
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:23,460
All right,
well that one might be true,

27
00:01:23,461 --> 00:01:24,294
but I think you see my point.
Maybe the best way to start a 

28
00:01:25,441 --> 00:01:29,670
conversation about political ideology is
to actually define the terms.

29
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:30,713
This is something I've done with a few 
guests so far because I often think 

30
00:01:33,151 --> 00:01:36,870
we're all talking about different things
while using the same words.

31
00:01:37,170 --> 00:01:38,003
Fear not.
I have Google and according to the 

32
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:42,930
Oxford Dictionary,
here's the definition of conservatism.

33
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:46,620
Conservatism is the holding of 
conservative principles.

34
00:01:46,860 --> 00:01:49,800
The tendency to resist great or sudden 
change,

35
00:01:49,801 --> 00:01:50,634
especially in politics,
adherence to traditional values and 

36
00:01:53,851 --> 00:01:57,660
ideas sometimes opposed to liberalism.
Alright,

37
00:01:57,720 --> 00:01:59,700
so I think we have a nice jumping off 
point there.

38
00:01:59,910 --> 00:02:00,743
Basically,
conservatives aren't big on change and 

39
00:02:02,971 --> 00:02:05,340
when they are,
they want to go about it slowly.

40
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:09,780
I think this concept has been conflated 
with the concept of right wing politics,

41
00:02:10,050 --> 00:02:10,883
so I even googled that.
According to the concise Oxford 

42
00:02:13,770 --> 00:02:15,930
Dictionary of politics in liberal 
democracies,

43
00:02:15,931 --> 00:02:20,130
the political right opposes socialism 
and social democracy,

44
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:22,550
right wing parties include 
conservatives,

45
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:24,990
Christian Democrats,
classic liberals,

46
00:02:25,290 --> 00:02:29,730
nationalists,
and the far right racists and fascist.

47
00:02:29,820 --> 00:02:33,330
You can see how these two concepts have 
morphed into the Republican Party.

48
00:02:33,331 --> 00:02:36,060
In America,
we have an ideology that doesn't want to

49
00:02:36,061 --> 00:02:36,894
change the system to quickly coupled 
with a political affiliation that is 

50
00:02:40,381 --> 00:02:44,070
focused on economics and some level of 
moral authority.

51
00:02:44,460 --> 00:02:45,293
Interestingly,
classical liberals are also included in 

52
00:02:47,281 --> 00:02:50,480
that group and the more and more I've 
been talking about this stuff,

53
00:02:50,530 --> 00:02:53,490
the more I've been considering myself in
that category.

54
00:02:53,730 --> 00:02:55,800
I'm going to touch on that more in the 
next couple of weeks.

55
00:02:56,070 --> 00:02:57,840
Now that we've laid out some basic 
terms,

56
00:02:57,841 --> 00:02:58,674
I think we have a solid jumping off 
point to discuss all the issues of the 

57
00:03:01,510 --> 00:03:05,140
day from abortion to economics,
to foreign policy to guns.

58
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:08,950
Can we find out where we agree instead 
of just yelling over each other?

59
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:09,993
I think we can,
but the only way is to be brave enough 

60
00:03:11,891 --> 00:03:14,350
to talk to those we don't actually agree
with.

61
00:03:14,590 --> 00:03:17,470
If we refuse to talk to those that we 
don't see eye to eye with,

62
00:03:17,650 --> 00:03:19,870
we'll just end up taking an eye for an 
eye.

63
00:03:22,690 --> 00:03:24,850
My guest this week is a lawyer,
a writer,

64
00:03:24,851 --> 00:03:28,120
and host of the aptly named Larry Elder 
radio show.

65
00:03:28,420 --> 00:03:29,890
Larry,
has it gone on a great day.

66
00:03:29,891 --> 00:03:31,120
Thank you for having me.
I appreciate it.

67
00:03:31,180 --> 00:03:32,170
Yeah.
Thanks for coming in.

68
00:03:32,171 --> 00:03:34,430
I've been trying to make this happen 
with you for awhile.

69
00:03:34,450 --> 00:03:36,670
Dodge darts and you forever caught up 
with me.

70
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:37,680
I.
I gotcha.

71
00:03:37,700 --> 00:03:39,790
I gotcha.
You've been in this studio before.

72
00:03:39,791 --> 00:03:41,580
I have a guest hosted for Larry a couple
times.

73
00:03:41,630 --> 00:03:44,140
Larry King or a king that's.
That's a Larry Man.

74
00:03:44,350 --> 00:03:45,820
He has a thing and it's kind of for the 
full hour.

75
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:46,733
Yeah,
he can.

76
00:03:47,410 --> 00:03:49,390
He can only have people with the name.
Larry,

77
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:51,310
I guess those words.
So that worked out for you.

78
00:03:51,620 --> 00:03:53,520
So there's a lot of stuff I want to talk
about it and in,

79
00:03:53,530 --> 00:03:54,363
in the beginning of the show I set up 
that I am a liberal or conservative 

80
00:03:57,860 --> 00:04:00,820
condolence.
This time this show is over,

81
00:04:00,821 --> 00:04:01,654
we can move you to the center a little 
bit and maybe by the time the show's 

82
00:04:03,340 --> 00:04:05,420
over weekend,
it's not gonna that's not at that,

83
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:06,940
but that's what it's all about.

84
00:04:06,940 --> 00:04:07,773
That's why I've wanted to have you on 
the show because I find there are some 

85
00:04:10,721 --> 00:04:13,030
people in the public space that I 
disagree with,

86
00:04:13,031 --> 00:04:13,864
but that I'd like to sit down and talk 
about some of the ideas and I consider 

87
00:04:16,751 --> 00:04:18,100
you in that,
in that case.

88
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:20,440
Um,
but before we get to the politics,

89
00:04:20,950 --> 00:04:21,783
I liked the audience,
know a little bit about the history of 

90
00:04:23,321 --> 00:04:24,970
the people I'm talking about.
So can you just,

91
00:04:24,971 --> 00:04:28,000
I know you were born in La,
give me a little larry elder history.

92
00:04:28,150 --> 00:04:30,760
Born and raised in La.
My Dad was a janitor.

93
00:04:30,761 --> 00:04:32,590
He cleaned toilets.
Uh,

94
00:04:32,690 --> 00:04:34,420
uh,
my dad was born in Athens,

95
00:04:34,421 --> 00:04:36,320
Georgia.
Doesn't know who his mother,

96
00:04:36,510 --> 00:04:38,200
his father,
his rather,

97
00:04:38,490 --> 00:04:39,880
um,
uh,

98
00:04:39,910 --> 00:04:42,940
my name's elder was a name with some 
dude who's in his life the longest.

99
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:44,113
Uh,
my father was kicked out of his house 

100
00:04:45,011 --> 00:04:48,430
and was 13 years old by his 
irresponsible grandmother and was on his

101
00:04:48,431 --> 00:04:50,500
own from that point on,
on my mom.

102
00:04:50,740 --> 00:04:52,920
Grew up on a farm kind of aristocracy 
for,

103
00:04:52,950 --> 00:04:54,010
for a black woman.
She,

104
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:55,510
uh,
owned the farm.

105
00:04:55,511 --> 00:04:57,880
They owned the farm.
Anyway,

106
00:04:57,881 --> 00:05:01,060
my dad and my mom got together and moved
to California in the forties.

107
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:02,870
I have two brothers.
Uh,

108
00:05:02,871 --> 00:05:03,970
I am,
as you mentioned,

109
00:05:03,971 --> 00:05:05,290
a lawyer,
uh,

110
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:06,633
born and raised in La and went to 
college in the East Coast Law School in 

111
00:05:09,341 --> 00:05:12,100
the Midwest,
state in Ohio for about 17 years.

112
00:05:12,101 --> 00:05:12,934
Came back to la about 22 years ago.
Got Into TV and radio and I've been 

113
00:05:16,001 --> 00:05:17,590
doing it ever since.
There you go.

114
00:05:17,591 --> 00:05:18,460
All right.
So now we got.

115
00:05:18,490 --> 00:05:22,300
We got the meat of what do you do that 
you're not a practicing lawyer,

116
00:05:22,301 --> 00:05:23,020
right?
Negative.

117
00:05:23,020 --> 00:05:24,310
No,
I did it for two and a half,

118
00:05:24,311 --> 00:05:25,144
three years and that was it.
I find a lot of people in the public 

119
00:05:28,211 --> 00:05:29,044
space either were lawyers at one time or
I know there's a ton of comedians that 

120
00:05:32,051 --> 00:05:32,680
were lawyers.

121
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:35,020
What is it about lawyers?
A lot of them want to get out.

122
00:05:35,350 --> 00:05:37,090
What's that about?
I'm not sure that's true.

123
00:05:37,091 --> 00:05:39,160
Um,
is just a real flexible thing to do.

124
00:05:39,190 --> 00:05:41,860
You learn how to reason.
You learn about the law.

125
00:05:41,861 --> 00:05:45,070
You learned about the constitution.
If you're a trial lawyer,

126
00:05:45,071 --> 00:05:48,250
you learn how to think on your feet and 
it lends itself to doing other things.

127
00:05:48,370 --> 00:05:50,050
But most people I know who went to law 
school,

128
00:05:50,051 --> 00:05:52,540
at least the ones I went to law school 
with a state and the law.

129
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:53,553
Yeah.
So was that a perfect segue to get you 

130
00:05:54,941 --> 00:05:58,040
to be someone that talks for a living?
Like instead of having to

131
00:05:58,040 --> 00:05:58,873
litigate it in the courtroom,
you could litigate it on air and bounce 

132
00:06:01,381 --> 00:06:02,960
back and forth with people.
And that's right.

133
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,940
Although most lawyers are not trial 
lawyers.

134
00:06:04,941 --> 00:06:07,910
It's kind of the image of most lawyers 
is that their Glib and fast.

135
00:06:08,090 --> 00:06:10,490
Most lawyers sit behind a desk and fill 
out papers.

136
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:11,333
There are tax lawyers or,
or constitutional lawyers or contract 

137
00:06:14,181 --> 00:06:16,580
lawyers or something like that.
Only about 10 percent of lawyers,

138
00:06:16,870 --> 00:06:19,130
uh,
ended up going to becoming litigated.

139
00:06:19,131 --> 00:06:21,440
And even a smaller number of those 
actually try cases.

140
00:06:21,590 --> 00:06:22,190
Yeah.
Alright.

141
00:06:22,190 --> 00:06:25,280
So now let's talk about conservatism.
Let's do it.

142
00:06:25,281 --> 00:06:26,114
So I've mostly been calling out the left
on my show because I consider myself 

143
00:06:29,751 --> 00:06:30,584
part of the left and I've seen the left 
sort of really go off the deep end to 

144
00:06:33,621 --> 00:06:35,120
the left and I haven't been happy about 
it.

145
00:06:35,540 --> 00:06:37,640
So I haven't talked that much about the 
right.

146
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:39,410
I've had a couple of people on the 
right.

147
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:41,780
So first off,
uh,

148
00:06:42,020 --> 00:06:42,853
how would you define conservatism?
What do you think that even means at 

149
00:06:45,621 --> 00:06:48,290
this point in America in 2016?
What is it considered?

150
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:50,030
Well,
I don't mind being called a conservative

151
00:06:50,370 --> 00:06:51,203
maturity.
I don't pretend to be a four letter 

152
00:06:51,741 --> 00:06:52,574
word,
but I really call myself a libertarian 

153
00:06:54,110 --> 00:06:55,370
a,
I believe in article one,

154
00:06:55,371 --> 00:06:56,204
section eight of the constitution,
which gives the federal government a 

155
00:06:57,821 --> 00:07:01,100
small number of things to do.
Dave meant money.

156
00:07:01,130 --> 00:07:02,750
Uh,
put together an army.

157
00:07:02,970 --> 00:07:05,870
I'm a deal with the border is a handful 
of other things.

158
00:07:05,900 --> 00:07:08,360
That's it.
A welfare,

159
00:07:08,380 --> 00:07:09,470
uh,
health care,

160
00:07:09,620 --> 00:07:11,450
abortion,
same sex marriage,

161
00:07:11,570 --> 00:07:12,680
Dr Sisto,
suicide,

162
00:07:12,681 --> 00:07:15,980
all the social issues that the supreme 
court takes up in my view,

163
00:07:15,981 --> 00:07:17,210
they shouldn't take up in the first 
place.

164
00:07:17,211 --> 00:07:19,460
That should be done on a state by state 
basis.

165
00:07:19,850 --> 00:07:21,710
That's what I think most conservatives 
believe as well.

166
00:07:22,370 --> 00:07:25,850
So I'm with you on a lot and I 
definitely have some libertarian beliefs

167
00:07:25,860 --> 00:07:27,590
myself.
I think most people are libertarian.

168
00:07:27,591 --> 00:07:29,840
They just don't know it.
The founding fathers were Libertarians,

169
00:07:30,020 --> 00:07:30,853
the founding fathers drafted a document 
that said our rights come from a power 

170
00:07:34,641 --> 00:07:38,360
other than individuals and government 
doesn't give us our rights.

171
00:07:38,361 --> 00:07:39,194
We give government our rights and power 
and everything else should be left to 

172
00:07:41,451 --> 00:07:42,284
the states and to individuals.
So that's how the constitution would 

173
00:07:44,951 --> 00:07:46,460
start it.
That's how the country was started.

174
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:49,040
And I think that's how most Americans 
really feel,

175
00:07:49,270 --> 00:07:50,420
uh,
when they really think about it.

176
00:07:50,570 --> 00:07:52,100
Well,
that's one of the funny things to me and

177
00:07:52,101 --> 00:07:54,560
why I've defended somebody like rand 
Paul,

178
00:07:54,610 --> 00:07:56,230
who's a lot of people would say as a 
liberal,

179
00:07:56,231 --> 00:07:57,710
I shouldn't be defending,
he's libertarian,

180
00:07:57,711 --> 00:07:58,544
but he's a libertarian,
so on issues such as a legalizing 

181
00:08:02,001 --> 00:08:05,480
marijuana or gay marriage,
a libertarian because you don't want the

182
00:08:05,481 --> 00:08:08,630
government in your bedroom,
you shouldn't care about these issues.

183
00:08:08,630 --> 00:08:09,463
And as a liberal,
I want people to do what they want and 

184
00:08:11,811 --> 00:08:12,644
marry who they want.
So that's somewhere where a libertarian 

185
00:08:14,941 --> 00:08:17,030
and the liberal can really sort of 
joined together,

186
00:08:17,031 --> 00:08:18,350
right?
I think so.

187
00:08:18,351 --> 00:08:19,184
However you have people like Bill Maher 
running around calling himself a 

188
00:08:21,141 --> 00:08:23,960
libertarian.
Bill Maher is not a libertarian.

189
00:08:23,961 --> 00:08:26,600
He believes in higher taxes.
He believes in a minimum wage.

190
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:28,033
He supported a Ralph Nader for,
for government who wants to take over 

191
00:08:31,970 --> 00:08:33,970
businesses and have government run them.
Uh,

192
00:08:34,020 --> 00:08:34,853
so a lot of people use it because it's 
the sexy kind of term and have no idea 

193
00:08:37,341 --> 00:08:38,151
what it is.
Right?

194
00:08:38,151 --> 00:08:40,460
So that's the economic side of it.
So you,

195
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:44,470
you're sort of,
he's liberal on the social stuff and in,

196
00:08:44,471 --> 00:08:45,700
in a way as a conservative,
you're,

197
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:49,490
you're actually pretty liberal on the 
concern on the social stuff.

198
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:51,080
Again,
I believe that same sex marriage,

199
00:08:51,081 --> 00:08:53,000
doctor assisted suicide,
all these kinds of things,

200
00:08:53,001 --> 00:08:55,950
abortion should be done on a state by 
state basis in California.

201
00:08:55,950 --> 00:08:56,783
We had to,
uh,

202
00:08:57,020 --> 00:08:57,853
um,
opportunities to vote for or against a 

203
00:09:01,020 --> 00:09:01,853
same sex marriage,
a proposition 30 and another time when 

204
00:09:04,021 --> 00:09:05,460
we voted on,
I think it was called,

205
00:09:05,461 --> 00:09:06,190
um,
uh,

206
00:09:06,190 --> 00:09:07,440
issue eight,
measure eight.

207
00:09:07,650 --> 00:09:08,483
And in both cases I voted in favor of 
same sex marriage in both cases I was 

208
00:09:10,711 --> 00:09:13,230
overruled.
I have no problem with the idea that the

209
00:09:13,231 --> 00:09:15,290
majority of my fellow Americans,
uh,

210
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:17,430
or our fellow Californians did not agree
with me.

211
00:09:17,431 --> 00:09:18,264
I don't believe that I then go to the 
Supreme Court and cram it down their 

212
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:21,420
throats of the other states.
Right.

213
00:09:21,421 --> 00:09:22,220
Okay.
So then that's,

214
00:09:22,220 --> 00:09:24,480
that's the state's rights issue and sort
of.

215
00:09:24,481 --> 00:09:25,314
So you would say that the Supreme Court 
is legislating from the bench or 

216
00:09:27,661 --> 00:09:28,920
something to that effect?
Yeah,

217
00:09:29,010 --> 00:09:29,843
I wouldn't.
Yeah.

218
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:30,780
And that,
so,

219
00:09:31,140 --> 00:09:33,210
so you're basically okay with what 
happened,

220
00:09:33,211 --> 00:09:35,310
you just don't like how it had.
Correct.

221
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:38,550
Yeah.
So someone like Rand Paul,

222
00:09:38,810 --> 00:09:40,470
uh,
because it sounds like you have a lot.

223
00:09:40,490 --> 00:09:41,990
Do we are supporting?
Not,

224
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:42,610
no,
I'm not.

225
00:09:42,610 --> 00:09:43,080
No,
I don't.

226
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:43,913
I don't,
I don't like Rand Paul because of his 

227
00:09:45,001 --> 00:09:45,834
position on foreign affairs and defense.
A lot of libertarians and I don't think 

228
00:09:49,411 --> 00:09:52,860
being a libertarian leads you to being 
an isolationist,

229
00:09:52,890 --> 00:09:53,723
although most libertarians are for 
reasons that I think are kind of 

230
00:09:56,011 --> 00:09:59,610
confusing,
but a rand Paul is one of those guys who

231
00:09:59,611 --> 00:10:00,444
attacked George W Bush for the Iraq war.
I think we were justified in going 

232
00:10:03,181 --> 00:10:04,014
there.
I think that the reason for going there 

233
00:10:04,891 --> 00:10:05,724
were legitimate and I think a lot of 
liberals are hypocritical on this issue 

234
00:10:08,281 --> 00:10:10,080
to.
You talked about how you,

235
00:10:10,170 --> 00:10:12,180
you chastise people on the left for 
being hypocrites.

236
00:10:12,181 --> 00:10:13,014
I'll give you one big one.
The argument against the Iraq war is 

237
00:10:15,931 --> 00:10:20,850
that George W dot Bush foolishly wanted 
to impose our values on another,

238
00:10:21,130 --> 00:10:22,650
uh,
another culture,

239
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:23,713
uh,
had no idea what the aftermath would be 

240
00:10:24,811 --> 00:10:25,890
if we get rid of this bad guy.

241
00:10:25,890 --> 00:10:27,240
Right.
However,

242
00:10:27,300 --> 00:10:28,133
Obama comes into office,
he joined with the British and the 

243
00:10:29,941 --> 00:10:33,240
French in bombing Libya.
Getting rid of Qaddafi.

244
00:10:33,250 --> 00:10:35,200
Why W he threatened us?
No,

245
00:10:35,550 --> 00:10:37,500
they did.
So for humanitarian,

246
00:10:37,660 --> 00:10:38,493
uh,
civil rights reasons read recently at a 

247
00:10:39,631 --> 00:10:41,550
debate was asked about why she did that.
She said,

248
00:10:41,551 --> 00:10:42,380
well,
uh,

249
00:10:42,380 --> 00:10:44,520
so they can have free elections.
Where was the left?

250
00:10:44,990 --> 00:10:46,710
Same thing with regard to,
to Egypt.

251
00:10:46,711 --> 00:10:48,210
We get rid of Mubarak.
He was a thug,

252
00:10:48,211 --> 00:10:51,450
but they're all thugs.
The Muslim Brotherhood comes in there,

253
00:10:51,690 --> 00:10:53,310
uh,
and Obama backs them,

254
00:10:53,580 --> 00:10:55,020
um,
and,

255
00:10:55,030 --> 00:10:56,340
and the country is worse than it was 
before.

256
00:10:56,610 --> 00:10:59,640
And then a.now
backing the guy that took over after the

257
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:03,180
genocide for reasons that escape me,
Obama decided,

258
00:11:03,210 --> 00:11:04,520
saw it had to go.
Yeah.

259
00:11:04,620 --> 00:11:07,200
Why these,
these countries did not threaten us.

260
00:11:07,201 --> 00:11:08,250
The way,
in my opinion,

261
00:11:08,251 --> 00:11:11,640
erected a Irak was a deal after the,
after nine slash 11,

262
00:11:11,641 --> 00:11:12,474
90 percent of the American people 
believe that we're going to get hit 

263
00:11:13,831 --> 00:11:14,520
again.

264
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:15,353
Uh,
and this guy was stealing from the oil 

265
00:11:16,621 --> 00:11:17,820
for food program.
He was,

266
00:11:18,570 --> 00:11:19,710
uh,
he was,

267
00:11:19,711 --> 00:11:20,580
uh,
uh,

268
00:11:21,010 --> 00:11:21,843
uh,
interfering with our patrolling the 

269
00:11:22,891 --> 00:11:24,600
southern didn't no fly zones.
Uh,

270
00:11:24,601 --> 00:11:27,290
he had used chemical weapons on his own 
people we know that because it used them

271
00:11:27,291 --> 00:11:28,920
on the Iranians.
They used them on the Kurds.

272
00:11:29,310 --> 00:11:30,143
Uh,
he tried to assassinate George Herbert 

273
00:11:32,010 --> 00:11:32,340
Walker Bush.
Uh,

274
00:11:32,340 --> 00:11:33,340
he was a threat,
uh,

275
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:34,313
and like it or not,
at least we had a legitimate reason for 

276
00:11:35,971 --> 00:11:38,550
going there.
And he got the backing of both the house

277
00:11:38,610 --> 00:11:40,970
and the Senate.
Obama did,

278
00:11:41,060 --> 00:11:42,150
did,
did Egypt,

279
00:11:42,151 --> 00:11:44,200
and he did Libya and he did a,
uh,

280
00:11:44,220 --> 00:11:45,053
Syria without the backing of Congress.
And yet the left didn't say a damn 

281
00:11:47,971 --> 00:11:48,541
thing.
Right.

282
00:11:48,541 --> 00:11:49,500
So,
yeah.

283
00:11:49,501 --> 00:11:50,334
So I'm,
I'm with you on the hypocrite part 

284
00:11:51,630 --> 00:11:53,130
because I listen,
I was,

285
00:11:53,140 --> 00:11:56,080
there's plenty of video.
I was against the Libya thing because at

286
00:11:56,081 --> 00:11:58,180
the very least,
at the very,

287
00:11:58,181 --> 00:11:59,014
very least,
if we're going to have a military 

288
00:11:59,861 --> 00:12:02,110
action,
we should have congressional approval.

289
00:12:02,110 --> 00:12:02,931
Right?
So then the,

290
00:12:02,931 --> 00:12:03,764
instead of calling it a war,
they called it a kinetic military 

291
00:12:06,101 --> 00:12:07,390
action.
And beyond that,

292
00:12:07,510 --> 00:12:08,320
uh,
uh,

293
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:09,153
Libya did not pose a threat to us.
He had no WMD because he gave them up 

294
00:12:13,691 --> 00:12:16,150
after we went into the war in Iraq.
He was scared.

295
00:12:16,151 --> 00:12:18,910
Belief plus he gave up the WMD and not 
the United Nations.

296
00:12:18,911 --> 00:12:21,010
He gave it to us if they're under lock 
and key,

297
00:12:21,011 --> 00:12:22,330
uh,
in Tennessee as we speak.

298
00:12:22,390 --> 00:12:24,700
So what was the rationale and where was 
the left?

299
00:12:24,740 --> 00:12:25,573
The same people yelling and screaming 
about George W dot Bush and Dick Cheney 

300
00:12:28,031 --> 00:12:30,070
and neo-cons and,
and nation building.

301
00:12:30,071 --> 00:12:31,660
Where were they?
They didn't say anything.

302
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:32,950
It's hypocritical.
Yeah.

303
00:12:33,010 --> 00:12:33,581
Well,
listen,

304
00:12:33,581 --> 00:12:36,280
we don't have congressional 
authorization right now.

305
00:12:36,430 --> 00:12:39,040
So I would assume by a lot of standards 
on the left,

306
00:12:39,041 --> 00:12:41,830
Obama is probably a gun to them,
right?

307
00:12:41,930 --> 00:12:42,763
If they,
if they're being consistent but they're 

308
00:12:43,871 --> 00:12:44,320
not.

309
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:46,660
So.
But what was the actual threat?

310
00:12:46,661 --> 00:12:48,490
I mean,
so I'm with you on some of this in terms

311
00:12:48,491 --> 00:12:51,520
of that we all sort of pick our sides 
and then our.

312
00:12:51,670 --> 00:12:54,010
Our value suddenly changed depending on 
who's in power,

313
00:12:54,190 --> 00:12:56,290
but what,
what do you think your principals you,

314
00:12:56,340 --> 00:12:58,330
you don't do that and I'd write it 
myself to be a principal.

315
00:12:58,390 --> 00:12:59,223
I,
I consider myself to be principled as 

316
00:13:00,191 --> 00:13:00,771
well,
so I.

317
00:13:00,771 --> 00:13:01,604
everything that I've said in the past 
related to all this stuff still still 

318
00:13:04,541 --> 00:13:05,374
stands up,
but what was the actual threat from 

319
00:13:07,091 --> 00:13:07,960
Iraq?
Look,

320
00:13:07,961 --> 00:13:08,794
I know that that Saddam did horrible 
things and you've laid out a couple of 

321
00:13:11,741 --> 00:13:12,281
them,
but what?

322
00:13:12,281 --> 00:13:16,090
What was the actual threat?
And George W dot Bush properly said that

323
00:13:16,091 --> 00:13:19,690
they were a grave and gathering danger 
after nine slash 11.

324
00:13:19,750 --> 00:13:20,583
Ninety percent of the American people 
thought we were going to get hit again 

325
00:13:22,690 --> 00:13:24,670
and thought that he was going to be 
bigger than nine slash 11.

326
00:13:24,940 --> 00:13:27,370
So George W Bush looks around and says,
where are the threats?

327
00:13:27,371 --> 00:13:29,320
We were still technically at war against
it.

328
00:13:29,321 --> 00:13:30,154
I was saying we went to war against him 
in 1991 and he promised to fully and 

329
00:13:33,161 --> 00:13:33,994
thoroughly declare his,
his chemical and biological weapons he 

330
00:13:36,311 --> 00:13:40,270
failed to do so he violated resolution 
after resolution after resolution,

331
00:13:40,271 --> 00:13:43,660
and we feared that he would either use 
them himself or give them to a terrorist

332
00:13:43,661 --> 00:13:46,120
and use them against us and make 9:11,
looked like a picnic.

333
00:13:46,300 --> 00:13:47,133
That was a threat.
We gave him 15 months to turn over this 

334
00:13:48,491 --> 00:13:50,350
stuff and he refused to do it.
Uh,

335
00:13:50,530 --> 00:13:51,363
a Bush went to the ninth and it did turn
out that there were no nuclear weapons 

336
00:13:55,470 --> 00:13:56,860
of mass destruction.
Actually,

337
00:13:56,861 --> 00:13:58,860
I disagree with that as well.
I believe the weapons were there.

338
00:13:58,870 --> 00:14:03,130
We gave him 15 months to thoroughly 
declare what he did in that 15 months.

339
00:14:03,130 --> 00:14:04,360
In my opinion,
he got rid of it.

340
00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:05,890
And I'm not the only person that's said 
that.

341
00:14:05,891 --> 00:14:07,170
Dave the,
um,

342
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:10,360
the national intelligence director,
our top spy,

343
00:14:10,361 --> 00:14:13,060
his name is James Clapper.
He's an office right now under Obama,

344
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:14,073
has publicly said he believes that 
Saddam Hussein did in fact have 

345
00:14:16,361 --> 00:14:18,470
stockpile for WMD,
got rid of them in the,

346
00:14:18,550 --> 00:14:20,890
during the 15 month run up to the war.
The,

347
00:14:20,891 --> 00:14:22,480
uh,
Israeli Mossad feels the same way.

348
00:14:22,481 --> 00:14:24,790
And there's several other American 
officials that have said that.

349
00:14:24,910 --> 00:14:27,250
So I don't believe George W Bush got the
intelligence wrong.

350
00:14:27,460 --> 00:14:28,293
We have 16 intelligence agencies.
All 16 said at the highest level of 

351
00:14:31,721 --> 00:14:32,554
probability that Saddam Hussein had 
stockpiles of chemical and biological 

352
00:14:35,321 --> 00:14:36,154
weapons.
Obama had the same CIA director who 

353
00:14:37,691 --> 00:14:39,150
served under Bill Clinton,
George Tenant.

354
00:14:39,310 --> 00:14:40,143
He said the likelihood that Saddam 
Hussein had chemical weapons and 

355
00:14:42,641 --> 00:14:43,474
biological weapons was a slam dunk.
And the same people that call up George 

356
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:48,820
W Bush a moron when he wanted him to go.

357
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:53,060
So all 16 of you guys say that he's this
stuff and you say you've got to George.

358
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:55,070
I just not feeling it,
so I'm not going to do it,

359
00:14:55,190 --> 00:14:57,950
but he's a moron.
So would you say that this is one of the

360
00:14:57,951 --> 00:14:58,784
cases that part of the problem,
and I think this is a through line 

361
00:15:00,771 --> 00:15:02,480
through everything we're going to 
discuss for the next hour,

362
00:15:02,690 --> 00:15:04,760
is that I don't know who to believe 
anymore.

363
00:15:04,761 --> 00:15:06,350
That's become a thing.
So James Clapper,

364
00:15:06,351 --> 00:15:08,240
who you just mentioned,
he's the same guy,

365
00:15:08,241 --> 00:15:09,074
the same CIA director who sat in front 
of Congress and said that we're not 

366
00:15:13,701 --> 00:15:14,534
spying on Americans remember,
and he was scratching the top of his 

367
00:15:16,191 --> 00:15:18,050
head because as they say in Seinfeld,
when you're lying,

368
00:15:18,060 --> 00:15:20,930
you touch the higher up you touch on 
your face and the bigger the lie is,

369
00:15:21,030 --> 00:15:21,890
and he's great.
And he says,

370
00:15:21,891 --> 00:15:24,410
we're not wittingly spying on the 
American public.

371
00:15:24,410 --> 00:15:26,660
We now know that that wasn't what he 
said was,

372
00:15:26,661 --> 00:15:29,570
I gave the least untruthful answer I 
could give,

373
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:32,510
but later on he admitted it.
And so to me,

374
00:15:32,511 --> 00:15:33,430
as far as I'm concerned,
he's.

375
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:34,333
He's legitimately honest guy.
Well I guess he gave the least honest 

376
00:15:38,181 --> 00:15:39,014
answer.
He least untruthful and least 

377
00:15:40,101 --> 00:15:43,520
untruthful.
But it wasn't I guess I guess.

378
00:15:43,521 --> 00:15:44,710
But it wasn't truthful.
Well,

379
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:46,700
it was classified.
It was classified.

380
00:15:46,701 --> 00:15:48,050
He wasn't supposed to talk about it,
but.

381
00:15:48,051 --> 00:15:48,884
All right,
so without,

382
00:15:48,890 --> 00:15:50,630
without getting too caught up in the 
words though,

383
00:15:50,830 --> 00:15:51,663
but do you think that's part of the 
problem that we just don't know who to 

384
00:15:53,181 --> 00:15:54,014
believe anymore?
I don't believe our government 

385
00:15:55,191 --> 00:15:56,900
officials.
We barely believe the media.

386
00:15:57,170 --> 00:15:59,330
Well,
I have my own issues with government,

387
00:15:59,331 --> 00:16:00,164
but my thing,
my problem with the Iraq war is that 

388
00:16:02,030 --> 00:16:04,730
Republicans failed to say what I've said
and defended.

389
00:16:04,910 --> 00:16:06,830
Even Jeb Bush is not defended that 
properly.

390
00:16:06,830 --> 00:16:08,210
He was asked when he first started 
running.

391
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:09,390
What do you think about the rack?
Wah,

392
00:16:09,391 --> 00:16:10,780
Wah,
Wah.

393
00:16:10,850 --> 00:16:11,750
But I,
I mean,

394
00:16:11,751 --> 00:16:12,584
honestly,
if you can't even defend what your 

395
00:16:13,311 --> 00:16:15,230
brother did,
how can other people do it?

396
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:18,230
So I think Americans have forgotten why 
we went there at one time,

397
00:16:18,410 --> 00:16:21,170
73 percent of the American people's 
support at this war.

398
00:16:21,590 --> 00:16:24,320
You have to remind people of why you've,
why you've gone to war and remind people

399
00:16:24,321 --> 00:16:26,430
what the reasons are and people have 
forgotten it.

400
00:16:26,431 --> 00:16:29,610
Now they have this vague idea that 
George w Bush overreacted and,

401
00:16:29,630 --> 00:16:32,990
and went in there and depose somebody 
because he just didn't like him.

402
00:16:33,260 --> 00:16:34,270
Uh,
and uh,

403
00:16:34,280 --> 00:16:36,110
that's why we were there and let's not 
do that anymore.

404
00:16:36,140 --> 00:16:39,290
That's kind of how people have given the
cliff notes version of what happened and

405
00:16:39,291 --> 00:16:41,990
it's unfair.
So what would you say to the people that

406
00:16:41,991 --> 00:16:42,824
would argue that isis wouldn't exist 
right now if we hadn't toppled sit down 

407
00:16:47,271 --> 00:16:50,840
because he at least had for all the 
horrible things he was doing in the bath

408
00:16:50,841 --> 00:16:51,050
party.

409
00:16:51,050 --> 00:16:51,883
We're doing terrible things and they 
were executing people and throwing gays 

410
00:16:53,901 --> 00:16:55,240
off roofs and uh,
you know,

411
00:16:55,250 --> 00:16:57,290
using mustard gas on the courage and all
that stuff,

412
00:16:57,560 --> 00:16:58,393
but at least he was keeping a sort of 
lid on the actual craziness that we're 

413
00:17:03,051 --> 00:17:04,530
seeing right now.
Um,

414
00:17:04,540 --> 00:17:05,373
my,
my problem with that is that we don't 

415
00:17:06,831 --> 00:17:09,680
know what Saddam Hussein would have done
had we not gone there,

416
00:17:10,100 --> 00:17:11,720
even though we didn't find the 
stockpiles.

417
00:17:11,780 --> 00:17:14,830
There were two people that George W Bush
sent to find the stockpiles.

418
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:15,793
One was named David k,
the other was named chuck doll for both 

419
00:17:18,621 --> 00:17:20,420
of them said we didn't find any 
stockpiles.

420
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:21,800
We screwed up.
However,

421
00:17:21,801 --> 00:17:25,970
this guy was going to reconstitute his 
WMD program and reconstitute his nuclear

422
00:17:25,971 --> 00:17:28,010
program.
When the heat was off,

423
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:29,480
so we would have had a dope deal with 
him.

424
00:17:29,481 --> 00:17:31,790
Anyway.
The second thing I say is that President

425
00:17:31,791 --> 00:17:36,380
Obama pulled out all the truth because 
he ran in 2008 and said the Iraq war was

426
00:17:36,381 --> 00:17:36,920
a dumb war.

427
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:37,753
We never should've gone there.
Over the advice of Hillary as secretary 

428
00:17:40,821 --> 00:17:43,130
of state over the advice of his 
secretary of defense,

429
00:17:43,670 --> 00:17:44,503
Leon Panetta,
over the advice of his former secretary 

430
00:17:46,311 --> 00:17:47,510
of defense,
Robert Gates,

431
00:17:47,511 --> 00:17:50,310
over the advice of the joint chiefs.
He pulled out all the troops.

432
00:17:50,370 --> 00:17:51,750
He was warned,
if you do this,

433
00:17:51,751 --> 00:17:53,040
there'll be a vacuum.
He did it.

434
00:17:53,041 --> 00:17:53,874
Anyway.
Ray Odierno is a member of the joint 

435
00:17:56,131 --> 00:17:56,964
chiefs.
He just retired and he gave a speech 

436
00:17:58,321 --> 00:18:02,070
when he retired and he was asked if he.
Does he believe that we should have left

437
00:18:02,071 --> 00:18:02,731
people there?
He says,

438
00:18:02,731 --> 00:18:03,870
yes.
Have we done so?

439
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:05,160
I said,
it could have been dealt with,

440
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:07,230
so in my opinion,
however you feel about it,

441
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:09,660
when Obama walked in,
inherited this mess,

442
00:18:09,900 --> 00:18:12,060
he should have made it better and not 
worse.

443
00:18:12,061 --> 00:18:13,610
He made it worse.
So in a way you're,

444
00:18:13,620 --> 00:18:16,350
so you're sort of blaming both sides,
right in that,

445
00:18:16,351 --> 00:18:18,970
in that,
or I guess I would blame both sides.

446
00:18:18,980 --> 00:18:19,813
I want put words in your mouth.
I would blame both sides here and that 

447
00:18:21,061 --> 00:18:25,290
we went to the wrong war and then by 
Obama leaving the way he did,

448
00:18:25,291 --> 00:18:26,124
even though most of the Americans very 
clearly didn't want to be there anymore 

449
00:18:28,381 --> 00:18:31,440
and when he ran for president seven 
years ago that his whole thing was,

450
00:18:31,441 --> 00:18:32,730
we're going to get out as soon as 
possible,

451
00:18:32,910 --> 00:18:33,743
but that then created the breeding 
ground for this because we didn't leave 

452
00:18:37,531 --> 00:18:39,900
in a in a sorta.
I'll go halfway with you.

453
00:18:40,140 --> 00:18:40,973
We didn't go into the wrong war.
Went to the right war for the right 

454
00:18:43,021 --> 00:18:43,854
reasons.
I think the intelligence was good and I 

455
00:18:45,661 --> 00:18:48,000
think the problem was when Obama came 
in,

456
00:18:48,060 --> 00:18:51,990
he wanted to get out so quickly that he 
did not realize what the aftermath would

457
00:18:51,991 --> 00:18:53,220
be.
And I'm not the only one who said this.

458
00:18:53,250 --> 00:18:55,830
Robert has written a book scathing 
attack,

459
00:18:56,100 --> 00:18:59,910
the most scathing attack on a sitting 
commander in chief by a former member of

460
00:18:59,911 --> 00:19:02,880
cabinet member I've ever read,
and he even recently,

461
00:19:02,881 --> 00:19:05,940
just a few days ago,
Dave said that Obama's national security

462
00:19:05,941 --> 00:19:08,580
and foreign policy advisors are 
dangerously naive.

463
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:10,620
They see the world through this prism 
that they want,

464
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:12,960
which is why the Benghazi thing 
happened.

465
00:19:12,961 --> 00:19:17,880
The reason that mid godly thing happened
as Obama's running in 2012 a GM is dead.

466
00:19:18,050 --> 00:19:18,883
A GM is alive.
Osama bin Laden is dead and Qaeda is on 

467
00:19:21,151 --> 00:19:21,961
the run.
Therefore,

468
00:19:21,961 --> 00:19:22,794
Ben Gazi was not thoroughly defendant 
because they thought that the Libyans 

469
00:19:25,501 --> 00:19:27,630
were happy with us because we got rid of
Gaddafi.

470
00:19:27,690 --> 00:19:28,111
Yeah.
Uh,

471
00:19:28,111 --> 00:19:29,970
and so,
at least in my opinion,

472
00:19:29,971 --> 00:19:30,804
the Obama Administration sees the world 
through their prism of this ridiculous 

473
00:19:35,611 --> 00:19:38,970
idea that if we are nicer to people and 
reach out with an unclenched fists,

474
00:19:38,971 --> 00:19:41,160
they will reach out in kind.
The world doesn't work that way.

475
00:19:41,161 --> 00:19:43,980
We have bad people who hate us and we 
need to deal with it.

476
00:19:44,430 --> 00:19:46,200
Right?
So I'm with you on that part for sure.

477
00:19:46,201 --> 00:19:48,870
Because look,
if you think back to the big speech that

478
00:19:48,871 --> 00:19:51,390
Obama gave in Cairo,
which was the,

479
00:19:51,391 --> 00:19:53,430
everyone said,
this is the reset,

480
00:19:53,431 --> 00:19:54,930
this is the,
we're going to be different.

481
00:19:55,260 --> 00:19:56,093
We're going to try to deal with people 
in region less with more with 

482
00:19:59,191 --> 00:20:01,410
discussion.
I mean the Middle East especially,

483
00:20:01,411 --> 00:20:02,244
but most of the world we were in more of
a precarious place now than I don't 

484
00:20:05,190 --> 00:20:08,270
think any part of the world is better 
off with Obama in a.

485
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:12,330
and I think that you look at polls now,
George W Bush left office,

486
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:13,130
uh,
in the,

487
00:20:13,130 --> 00:20:13,963
in the low thirties.
I don't think any president has been 

488
00:20:15,571 --> 00:20:18,270
that unpopular in my lifetime.
You look at polls now,

489
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:20,670
more people like George W Bush didn't 
like Obama.

490
00:20:20,850 --> 00:20:21,683
Obama's rating is at 45 percent.
Bill Clinton's at this juncture in the 

491
00:20:24,571 --> 00:20:26,520
seventh year of his term,
he was at 65 percent.

492
00:20:26,670 --> 00:20:28,950
Most American believer on the wrong 
track economically.

493
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:31,590
And most Americans believe we're on the 
wrong track in terms of foreign policy.

494
00:20:31,750 --> 00:20:32,310
Yeah.
Alright.

495
00:20:32,310 --> 00:20:34,530
So I don't want to get too lost in,
in just foreign policy.

496
00:20:34,531 --> 00:20:35,364
So last thing on this is a lot of what 
you're saying sort of sounds like 

497
00:20:37,891 --> 00:20:38,724
neoconservative stuff to me is there,
can you be a libertarian and a 

498
00:20:42,060 --> 00:20:42,750
neoconservative?

499
00:20:42,750 --> 00:20:43,583
I mean,
I know this is what you're getting to 

500
00:20:44,221 --> 00:20:45,054
before.
This is sort of why you don't like Ran 

501
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:47,513
Paul,
but do those things seemed like they 

502
00:20:47,981 --> 00:20:48,814
have nothing to do with each other and 
yet I know that there's a lot of people 

503
00:20:51,221 --> 00:20:53,260
that do sort of get what you're,
what you're saying.

504
00:20:53,290 --> 00:20:55,240
Well,
the term neoconservatives and to me as a

505
00:20:55,241 --> 00:20:57,580
four letter word is a term that people 
invent to,

506
00:20:57,900 --> 00:21:01,060
to malign somebodies position.
I see the world realistically.

507
00:21:01,150 --> 00:21:02,890
I think we have enemies.
We need to deal with them.

508
00:21:03,030 --> 00:21:04,030
Uh,
I did not believe,

509
00:21:04,031 --> 00:21:06,580
as you did just now pointed out that we 
should have gone to war in,

510
00:21:07,210 --> 00:21:09,460
in Libya.
I don't believe in doing anything unless

511
00:21:09,461 --> 00:21:11,290
it's consistent with our national 
security interests.

512
00:21:11,470 --> 00:21:13,090
When Jimmy Carter,
for example,

513
00:21:13,340 --> 00:21:14,173
uh,
through the Shah of Iran under the bus 

514
00:21:15,580 --> 00:21:17,020
in the seventies,
what was that all about?

515
00:21:17,020 --> 00:21:21,520
He did it because he wanted freedom.
He wanted to liberate the people who are

516
00:21:21,521 --> 00:21:24,190
behind bars,
the same people we now call terrorists.

517
00:21:24,420 --> 00:21:25,253
Uh,
these are the ones that Obama force the 

518
00:21:26,111 --> 00:21:28,780
shaw to let out of prison and they 
ultimately topple the regime.

519
00:21:29,020 --> 00:21:31,990
What's that all about?
It's not our job to impose democracy.

520
00:21:31,991 --> 00:21:36,991
It's our job to make sure that countries
are not our enemies.

521
00:21:37,001 --> 00:21:37,834
Our countries are doing things that are 
consistent with our own national 

522
00:21:39,491 --> 00:21:40,840
security interest.
That,

523
00:21:41,080 --> 00:21:42,130
that's my problem.
Right?

524
00:21:42,131 --> 00:21:42,964
So you don't want to nation build,
you want to do things that you consider 

525
00:21:45,550 --> 00:21:47,860
sort of defensive posture.
Correct.

526
00:21:47,890 --> 00:21:49,220
We went into a,
a,

527
00:21:49,270 --> 00:21:50,103
a Haiti I think during Bill Clinton's 
administration because they were having 

528
00:21:53,021 --> 00:21:54,010
difficulties,
not our job.

529
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:55,480
Uh,
I want to get this right.

530
00:21:55,481 --> 00:21:56,860
So I'm gonna.
Look at my notes for this.

531
00:21:56,861 --> 00:21:58,630
According to this,
uh,

532
00:21:58,631 --> 00:22:01,840
you are black,
is that correct?

533
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:04,450
That is correct.
Not African American.

534
00:22:04,451 --> 00:22:05,284
That's not a term I like you.
How come you don't like the term as 

535
00:22:06,690 --> 00:22:08,830
ridiculous?
I was born and raised in America.

536
00:22:08,831 --> 00:22:10,590
I've never been to Africa.
Uh,

537
00:22:10,930 --> 00:22:12,790
how,
why am I an African American?

538
00:22:12,791 --> 00:22:13,624
Most of my people that have been here 
longer than most of other other people 

539
00:22:16,031 --> 00:22:17,050
in this room,
uh,

540
00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:19,220
yet most people don't have a hyphen.
Uh,

541
00:22:19,260 --> 00:22:20,920
you know,
I'm an Italian American,

542
00:22:20,921 --> 00:22:22,870
Greek American,
Romanian American.

543
00:22:23,050 --> 00:22:23,883
It's an absurd term.
It's a term that Jesse Jackson almost 

544
00:22:26,531 --> 00:22:29,500
single handedly cram,
cram down the throats of our media.

545
00:22:29,501 --> 00:22:30,334
And after Jackson began to talk about 
why a black should have some connection 

546
00:22:34,001 --> 00:22:36,040
to Africa,
all of a sudden New York Times,

547
00:22:36,041 --> 00:22:36,874
La Times,
all of the media began using that 

548
00:22:38,201 --> 00:22:39,120
expression.
It's the excellence.

549
00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:39,770
Yeah.
I mean,

550
00:22:39,770 --> 00:22:40,603
I personally don't use the term African 
American that much because one time I 

551
00:22:43,151 --> 00:22:46,300
had a guest on the show and I referred 
to her is African American.

552
00:22:46,300 --> 00:22:46,601
She said,
well,

553
00:22:46,601 --> 00:22:48,370
I'm actually Jamaican.
So,

554
00:22:48,371 --> 00:22:50,740
you know what I mean.
So I guess that that goes to your point.

555
00:22:51,210 --> 00:22:52,660
And I remember reading one time,
Dave,

556
00:22:52,661 --> 00:22:53,420
somebody,
uh,

557
00:22:53,420 --> 00:22:54,253
uh,
was given a description of some suspect 

558
00:22:55,630 --> 00:22:58,180
who had done some crime,
was running away,

559
00:22:58,410 --> 00:22:59,530
uh,
and uh,

560
00:22:59,531 --> 00:23:02,020
he was described as an African American.
How do you know where he was from?

561
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:04,540
Goodman from Africa coming from Jamaica,
from Canada.

562
00:23:04,840 --> 00:23:05,620
So what are they going,
what,

563
00:23:05,620 --> 00:23:06,453
what do you make of that when someone 
like [inaudible] I know you really rail 

564
00:23:07,931 --> 00:23:11,110
against Jesse Jackson and,
and these guys on the left that use,

565
00:23:11,170 --> 00:23:13,020
and I want to talk a lot about identity 
politics.

566
00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:16,480
So the guys that use these phrases,
what are they going for?

567
00:23:16,481 --> 00:23:17,500
Their.
Well,

568
00:23:17,590 --> 00:23:18,423
their goal,
the goal is to tell black people that 

569
00:23:21,461 --> 00:23:22,294
were victims that uh,
discrimination and racism remain major 

570
00:23:24,431 --> 00:23:26,320
problems in America when in fact they 
don't,

571
00:23:26,760 --> 00:23:28,060
uh,
and uh,

572
00:23:28,090 --> 00:23:31,330
they want black people to vote for the 
Democratic Party.

573
00:23:31,570 --> 00:23:34,510
The Democratic Party gets a 95 percent 
of the black vote.

574
00:23:34,790 --> 00:23:35,623
Uh,
and the reason they get it is because 

575
00:23:36,521 --> 00:23:37,354
blacks are convinced that the number one
issue facing the country right now is 

576
00:23:40,001 --> 00:23:41,560
social justice,
racist,

577
00:23:41,561 --> 00:23:42,930
white cops,
uh,

578
00:23:43,060 --> 00:23:45,280
discrimination,
systemic racism,

579
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:46,560
microaggression,
whatever,

580
00:23:46,561 --> 00:23:48,860
a new word that come up with and as a 
bunch of nonsense.

581
00:23:48,861 --> 00:23:49,694
And number one problem domestically 
facing this country is a breakdown of 

582
00:23:51,891 --> 00:23:53,070
the family.
And uh,

583
00:23:53,090 --> 00:23:57,020
President Obama said it,
I didn't have a black kid or kid,

584
00:23:57,021 --> 00:23:59,930
not just the black kid.
A kid raised without a dad is five times

585
00:23:59,931 --> 00:24:00,764
more likely to be poor and commit crimes
nine times more likely to drop out of 

586
00:24:03,531 --> 00:24:05,780
school and 20 times more likely to end 
up in jail.

587
00:24:05,990 --> 00:24:06,823
So you're far more likely to end up in 
jail without having a dad than you are 

588
00:24:08,931 --> 00:24:10,600
because of a white racist cop.
Right?

589
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:11,473
So,
but you wouldn't not acknowledge that 

590
00:24:12,921 --> 00:24:14,650
there are some systemic issues.

591
00:24:14,670 --> 00:24:15,503
And give me an example.
Tell me what you think the most 

592
00:24:16,911 --> 00:24:19,040
instamatic racist issue is.
What is it?

593
00:24:19,550 --> 00:24:22,550
Well,
I would say that because black people in

594
00:24:22,551 --> 00:24:23,384
most cases,
in many cases we're descendants of 

595
00:24:25,221 --> 00:24:27,230
slaves.
That racism as a,

596
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:30,860
as an institution that in 2000 a certain
amount of it just exists.

597
00:24:30,980 --> 00:24:31,813
Two thousand and 15.
That gives me the most blatant racist 

598
00:24:33,891 --> 00:24:36,170
example you can come up with right now.
Um,

599
00:24:36,650 --> 00:24:37,483
I think you could probably find evidence
that in general cops or the cops are 

600
00:24:43,281 --> 00:24:48,281
more willing to shoot if the perpetrator
is black.

601
00:24:48,921 --> 00:24:49,754
What's your date of Nyu?
What's your basis for saying that last 

602
00:24:51,670 --> 00:24:52,940
year will look.
I know a lot of people would say,

603
00:24:52,941 --> 00:24:54,840
look what's going on.
And I know what they would say,

604
00:24:54,841 --> 00:24:55,674
I'm talking about what the facts are.
Nine hundred and 65 people were shot by 

605
00:24:57,801 --> 00:25:01,670
cops last last year and killed four 
percent of them were white cops shooting

606
00:25:01,671 --> 00:25:04,700
unarmed blacks in,
in Chicago in 2011,

607
00:25:04,701 --> 00:25:05,120
21.

608
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:07,160
People were shot and killed by cops.
Uh,

609
00:25:07,280 --> 00:25:11,330
in 2015 there were seven a in Chicago,
which is a third black,

610
00:25:11,331 --> 00:25:12,830
a third white,
and a third Hispanic.

611
00:25:12,950 --> 00:25:15,440
Seventy percent of the homicides are 
black on black,

612
00:25:15,620 --> 00:25:17,180
uh,
about 40 per month,

613
00:25:17,181 --> 00:25:20,540
almost 500 in the per year last year in 
Chicago.

614
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:24,470
And 75 percent of them are unsolved.
Whereas the black lives matter on that,

615
00:25:24,680 --> 00:25:29,560
the idea that a racist white cop 
shooting unarmed black people is apparel

616
00:25:29,570 --> 00:25:33,620
to black people is bs,
is complete and total bs.

617
00:25:33,860 --> 00:25:34,693
And,
and the reason for these so-called 

618
00:25:36,590 --> 00:25:37,423
activists saying this is the assumption 
that racism remains a major problem in 

619
00:25:39,831 --> 00:25:40,940
America.
The media,

620
00:25:40,941 --> 00:25:41,774
CNN,
especially MSNBC runs down whenever a 

621
00:25:43,881 --> 00:25:45,690
black cop shoots somebody,
uh,

622
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:46,380
and,
and uh,

623
00:25:46,380 --> 00:25:46,850
and it's,
uh,

624
00:25:46,850 --> 00:25:48,380
some,
some march on Washington.

625
00:25:48,381 --> 00:25:50,540
It's ridiculous.
A black people,

626
00:25:50,780 --> 00:25:53,570
half the homicides in this country are 
committed by and against black people.

627
00:25:53,571 --> 00:25:55,490
Last year there were 14,000
homicides.

628
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:58,070
Not talking about suicide.
I'm talking about homicides.

629
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:01,640
Half of them were black.
90 six percent of them black on black.

630
00:26:01,660 --> 00:26:04,370
Of that 7,000.
Where's the black on black lives matter.

631
00:26:04,371 --> 00:26:07,250
People on that.
So there's where you would say that this

632
00:26:07,251 --> 00:26:08,084
is purely because of social justice,
purely because they want ultimately for 

633
00:26:12,411 --> 00:26:15,590
people to be angry enough to just keep 
voting democrat.

634
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:16,670
That's right.
And where's,

635
00:26:16,700 --> 00:26:17,533
where's the evidence of a lack of social
justice when a black suspect is killed 

636
00:26:21,771 --> 00:26:23,930
by a cop?
Believe me,

637
00:26:23,931 --> 00:26:25,790
the media's on it.
People are watching it.

638
00:26:26,040 --> 00:26:27,290
Uh,
and uh,

639
00:26:27,350 --> 00:26:28,183
and justice will,
will for the most part to occur in 

640
00:26:31,250 --> 00:26:34,520
Baltimore where Freddie gray was killed.
Freddie gray died in a van,

641
00:26:34,521 --> 00:26:35,900
I shouldn't say was killed.
Died in a van.

642
00:26:35,901 --> 00:26:38,990
Yeah.
You have a city that's a 45 percent.

643
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:42,620
Black City Council is 100 percent 
Democrat.

644
00:26:42,621 --> 00:26:44,340
The majority of city council is black.

645
00:26:44,490 --> 00:26:47,700
The top cop at the time was with black.
The number two cop with black,

646
00:26:47,701 --> 00:26:49,350
the majority of the command staff is 
black,

647
00:26:49,560 --> 00:26:52,920
the mayor is black,
the age is black.

648
00:26:53,060 --> 00:26:53,893
Uh,
and yet here we are talking about 

649
00:26:54,661 --> 00:26:55,411
racism.
I mean,

650
00:26:55,411 --> 00:26:56,580
it's,
it's absurd.

651
00:26:56,850 --> 00:26:58,230
It's absurd.
So it's funny,

652
00:26:58,231 --> 00:26:59,064
I find myself caught in between this a 
little bit as a liberal where I want to 

653
00:27:02,281 --> 00:27:05,580
always try to defend the other.
So in this case,

654
00:27:05,820 --> 00:27:08,850
the other being black people,
I'm always sympathetic to that.

655
00:27:09,150 --> 00:27:09,660
And they,
uh,

656
00:27:09,660 --> 00:27:10,220
yeah,
yeah.

657
00:27:10,220 --> 00:27:12,120
At the same time I hear you laying out a
pretty solid.

658
00:27:12,121 --> 00:27:13,200
Well,
these are just the facts.

659
00:27:13,201 --> 00:27:14,850
I'll tell you something else too,
that was just a study,

660
00:27:15,340 --> 00:27:17,450
a university of Washington,
uh,

661
00:27:17,460 --> 00:27:20,130
and it turns out cops were more 
reluctant,

662
00:27:20,160 --> 00:27:20,993
more hesitant to pull the trigger 
against the blacks black suspect than a 

663
00:27:23,491 --> 00:27:24,540
white suspect.
Uh,

664
00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:25,673
probably because of the fear of being 
accused of racially profiling and the 

665
00:27:28,231 --> 00:27:30,960
fear that the civil rights establish it 
was going to come down on him.

666
00:27:31,170 --> 00:27:32,730
So if anything,
uh,

667
00:27:32,731 --> 00:27:35,220
whites are more likely to be shot by a 
cop under,

668
00:27:35,240 --> 00:27:36,900
under certain circumstances than a,
than a,

669
00:27:37,080 --> 00:27:39,870
than a black person.
And in last 30 or 40 years,

670
00:27:40,170 --> 00:27:41,003
the number of percentage of suspects 
killed by cops who are black has 

671
00:27:45,151 --> 00:27:47,190
declined.
Seventy five percent.

672
00:27:47,310 --> 00:27:48,143
However,
the percentage of whites killed by cops 

673
00:27:49,260 --> 00:27:50,430
has flatlined.
Yeah.

674
00:27:50,450 --> 00:27:52,980
And so if anything,
people are more concerned about shooting

675
00:27:52,981 --> 00:27:55,710
black people for fear that they're going
to be called racist.

676
00:27:55,830 --> 00:27:57,750
And almost all every one of these 
incidents,

677
00:27:57,751 --> 00:27:58,584
whether it's Eric Gardener in in New 
York who died because he was selling 

678
00:28:01,291 --> 00:28:02,124
loosies and we resisted arrest,
whether there's Tamir rice in Cleveland 

679
00:28:04,471 --> 00:28:05,790
who hit,
was twirling around the gun,

680
00:28:05,970 --> 00:28:06,803
whether it's Michael Brown in Ferguson 
who had just a committed and strong arm 

681
00:28:10,441 --> 00:28:11,274
robbery.
Almost every one of these incidents 

682
00:28:12,721 --> 00:28:13,554
involve somebody resisting arrest.
Why don't you just do what the police 

683
00:28:15,961 --> 00:28:16,320
tell you?

684
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:17,880
My Dad said,
when I get pulled over,

685
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:20,400
had my hand at 10:00,
have my hand at 2:00

686
00:28:20,520 --> 00:28:21,830
say yes sir.
No Sir.

687
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:25,770
Make sure my paperwork is in order.
And if I feel the cop is mistreating me,

688
00:28:25,890 --> 00:28:27,900
get a badge number and deal with it.
Later on.

689
00:28:28,110 --> 00:28:28,943
If Jesse Jackson and Al Sharpton and 
Obama and the whole group of them told 

690
00:28:33,001 --> 00:28:36,210
black people to do that,
we'd have a lot fewer of these things to

691
00:28:36,211 --> 00:28:37,830
deal with in the first place.
Yeah.

692
00:28:38,050 --> 00:28:38,671
All right.
So,

693
00:28:38,671 --> 00:28:39,630
um,
with the,

694
00:28:39,631 --> 00:28:40,464
uh,
I'm hearing a lot of what you're saying 

695
00:28:41,141 --> 00:28:41,974
in here.
So as a black conservative then who now 

696
00:28:44,521 --> 00:28:46,800
you've,
you've laid out your case there,

697
00:28:47,160 --> 00:28:48,600
but you haven't laid out yours.
I asked,

698
00:28:48,630 --> 00:28:49,463
I asked you to name the most important 
example of racism and you gave white 

699
00:28:52,621 --> 00:28:54,720
cops going after black people and I,
and I told you,

700
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:55,920
gave you the facts for that.

701
00:28:55,920 --> 00:28:57,720
So that's nonsense that you must have 
something else.

702
00:28:57,721 --> 00:29:00,210
What else does it,
if you think racism remains a problem in

703
00:29:00,211 --> 00:29:00,791
America?
Give it to.

704
00:29:00,791 --> 00:29:02,340
Well,
I think it remains a problem.

705
00:29:02,370 --> 00:29:05,760
How do you not even tell me it may not 
be systemic in that we have.

706
00:29:05,790 --> 00:29:08,310
It's not like you're not being hired 
because you're black.

707
00:29:08,311 --> 00:29:09,860
There's no systemic reason,
you know,

708
00:29:09,870 --> 00:29:11,580
legal reason that,
that exists,

709
00:29:11,581 --> 00:29:14,640
that kind of thing.
But I think that racism as a general,

710
00:29:15,110 --> 00:29:15,943
uh,
I need some.

711
00:29:16,260 --> 00:29:18,450
I need some.
I need some specifics that you gave me,

712
00:29:18,451 --> 00:29:19,560
the white cop thing.
What else?

713
00:29:19,561 --> 00:29:21,150
Give me another example.
What do you think is a problem?

714
00:29:21,640 --> 00:29:22,480
We'll,
we'll,

715
00:29:22,500 --> 00:29:23,333
uh,
as a black conservative telling me how 

716
00:29:25,051 --> 00:29:26,790
to know you,
how do you get people to come around?

717
00:29:26,791 --> 00:29:27,624
You're,
you're the one who made the assertion 

718
00:29:28,201 --> 00:29:30,270
that racism remains a major problem in 
America.

719
00:29:30,450 --> 00:29:31,283
I asked you to give me an example.
You gave me white cops going after 

720
00:29:33,151 --> 00:29:33,984
blacks.
I,

721
00:29:34,170 --> 00:29:36,330
as far as I'm concerned,
you didn't hold it up very well.

722
00:29:36,430 --> 00:29:38,850
It was the other argument you have.
What's the other thing?

723
00:29:38,970 --> 00:29:39,803
Well,
I don't know that it's systemic in that 

724
00:29:41,290 --> 00:29:43,660
in the sort of macro sense,
I'm not an ad.

725
00:29:43,661 --> 00:29:45,470
I know that.
I want to know what it is you're,

726
00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:46,020
you're talking.
No,

727
00:29:46,020 --> 00:29:46,550
no,
that,

728
00:29:46,550 --> 00:29:48,340
that's exactly what that's.
Believe me,

729
00:29:48,341 --> 00:29:49,174
that's 100 percent.
You're not getting into school bs that 

730
00:29:52,181 --> 00:29:53,740
we have a race.
We have affirmative action.

731
00:29:53,950 --> 00:29:58,180
So a black person with a,
with an sat and a GPA of x,

732
00:29:58,200 --> 00:29:59,033
we'll,
we'll get into a school faster and 

733
00:30:00,341 --> 00:30:04,090
easier than a white person with an sat 
or a gpa of x.

734
00:30:04,210 --> 00:30:06,570
and if going to,
going to school is a route to the middle

735
00:30:06,571 --> 00:30:07,404
class,
you can make an argument that blacks 

736
00:30:08,381 --> 00:30:10,300
have an easier route to middle to the 
middle class.

737
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:14,050
If you're talking about a black poverty,
um,

738
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:17,800
the poorer you are,
the more accessible loans and grants are

739
00:30:17,801 --> 00:30:18,790
for you.
Uh,

740
00:30:18,791 --> 00:30:19,190
the,
the,

741
00:30:19,190 --> 00:30:20,320
the,
the problem,

742
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:22,720
the biggest burden that black people 
have in my opinion,

743
00:30:22,721 --> 00:30:24,620
again,
is the percentage of blacks,

744
00:30:24,621 --> 00:30:27,610
75 percent of them that are raised 
without fathers,

745
00:30:27,730 --> 00:30:30,820
uh,
and that has every other social negative

746
00:30:30,821 --> 00:30:32,890
consequences connected to it.
Crime,

747
00:30:33,050 --> 00:30:33,883
uh,
not being able to compete economically 

748
00:30:35,531 --> 00:30:37,300
in the country,
being more likely to be arrested.

749
00:30:37,450 --> 00:30:39,460
That's the number one problem facing the
black community.

750
00:30:39,550 --> 00:30:44,110
And when I hear people telling me about 
systemic racism or unconscious racism,

751
00:30:44,111 --> 00:30:45,550
I always say,
give me an example.

752
00:30:45,610 --> 00:30:47,650
And almost nobody can do it.
So,

753
00:30:47,710 --> 00:30:48,543
so the family stuff.
So I'll follow your logic there and 

754
00:30:50,590 --> 00:30:51,423
family stuff.
What can actually be done about that 

755
00:30:53,510 --> 00:30:55,900
then?
Because that's a big reverse.

756
00:30:55,901 --> 00:30:57,430
The welfare state,
uh,

757
00:30:57,431 --> 00:30:59,740
in 18,
90,

758
00:30:59,770 --> 00:31:01,660
1900,
you look at census reports,

759
00:31:02,170 --> 00:31:03,490
a black kid,
believe it or not,

760
00:31:03,491 --> 00:31:07,090
with slightly more likely to be born to 
a nuclear family than a white kid.

761
00:31:07,330 --> 00:31:09,280
Even during slavery,
uh,

762
00:31:09,281 --> 00:31:10,114
a black kid was more likely to be born 
under a roof with his biological mother 

763
00:31:13,181 --> 00:31:14,014
and biological father.
Then today what's happened is we 

764
00:31:16,181 --> 00:31:20,320
launched this so called war on poverty 
in the sixties were literally,

765
00:31:20,321 --> 00:31:21,154
Lyndon Johnson sent,
people were knocking on doors and I 

766
00:31:23,891 --> 00:31:26,940
lived in the sixties and people knocked 
on doors uprising.

767
00:31:26,950 --> 00:31:30,640
Women of their availability to welfare 
provided there was no man in the house.

768
00:31:31,270 --> 00:31:32,103
And we went from 25 percent of black 
being born outside of wedlock and 65 to 

769
00:31:35,321 --> 00:31:36,154
75 percent right now.
And you look at how much money that we 

770
00:31:38,231 --> 00:31:39,600
spent on welfare,
uh,

771
00:31:39,601 --> 00:31:40,434
in the lines are parallel.
It was a neutron bomb dropped on this 

772
00:31:43,241 --> 00:31:44,710
country and not just in the black 
community,

773
00:31:44,890 --> 00:31:46,580
but on people in general.
Uh,

774
00:31:46,780 --> 00:31:47,613
at one time,
only about five percent of whites were 

775
00:31:48,941 --> 00:31:49,774
born outside of wedlock.
Now 25 percent of whites are born 

776
00:31:52,001 --> 00:31:52,834
outside of wedlock.

777
00:31:52,990 --> 00:31:57,490
I was in college in 1970 and there was a
report called the Moynihan report.

778
00:31:57,760 --> 00:31:59,050
Uh,
the Negro family,

779
00:31:59,051 --> 00:32:03,640
a case for national action is written by
liberal by a man who became a Democratic

780
00:32:03,641 --> 00:32:07,180
senator for from New York.
And at the time 25 percent of black kids

781
00:32:07,181 --> 00:32:08,380
are born outside of wedlock.
He said,

782
00:32:08,381 --> 00:32:09,580
my God,
this number is,

783
00:32:09,790 --> 00:32:11,470
is horrific.
If we don't do something about it,

784
00:32:11,500 --> 00:32:12,940
it could get even higher.
Well,

785
00:32:12,941 --> 00:32:16,150
fast forward 25 percent of white kids 
and now born outside of wedlock.

786
00:32:16,330 --> 00:32:18,220
It is the number one problem in this 
country.

787
00:32:18,280 --> 00:32:21,550
And what we've done in my opinion,
is we've economically incentivized women

788
00:32:21,551 --> 00:32:24,610
to marry the government and we've 
allowed men to abandoned their financial

789
00:32:24,611 --> 00:32:26,620
and more responsibility.
And now we have this.

790
00:32:27,060 --> 00:32:28,510
So do you think the left has done this?
Right?

791
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:30,910
Okay.
So do you think then that as a,

792
00:32:30,911 --> 00:32:31,744
as a black conservative,
that the biggest issue is it's 

793
00:32:34,241 --> 00:32:36,590
impossible to have this conversation,
right?

794
00:32:36,690 --> 00:32:38,200
Right.
Like the stuff we're talking about right

795
00:32:38,201 --> 00:32:41,480
now is rarely discussed in the media.
You know,

796
00:32:41,481 --> 00:32:42,314
people,
you've written some books about it and 

797
00:32:43,430 --> 00:32:44,930
people talk about it every now and 
again,

798
00:32:44,931 --> 00:32:47,300
but we rarely have this discussion 
because,

799
00:32:47,450 --> 00:32:48,283
and this is where I will agree with you 
that the left has made language such a 

800
00:32:51,501 --> 00:32:52,334
problem and everyone's so trigger 
warnings and safe space that we're 

801
00:32:54,621 --> 00:32:56,510
afraid that if you have this 
conversation,

802
00:32:56,660 --> 00:32:58,250
that somehow I'm going to come off 
racist.

803
00:32:58,270 --> 00:33:00,140
You know,
that's not where we were,

804
00:33:00,180 --> 00:33:01,013
where we don't have the conversation.
We don't have the conversation because 

805
00:33:02,301 --> 00:33:03,860
the left within have to look in the 
mirror and go,

806
00:33:03,861 --> 00:33:04,694
Jesus h Christ,
look at what I've done and they don't 

807
00:33:06,981 --> 00:33:07,814
want to do this.
I've had a radio show for almost 25 

808
00:33:09,771 --> 00:33:10,604
years.
I've invited Jesse Jackson on 50 times 

809
00:33:12,801 --> 00:33:14,750
60 times.
I've invited our sharpened on that.

810
00:33:14,900 --> 00:33:16,850
That number,
a maxine waters,

811
00:33:16,851 --> 00:33:17,684
another loud mouth,
black woman around here with running 

812
00:33:18,831 --> 00:33:19,940
around talking about racism.

813
00:33:20,030 --> 00:33:20,863
She won't come on my show either.
They don't want to deal with these 

814
00:33:22,671 --> 00:33:23,630
issues.
Why?

815
00:33:23,631 --> 00:33:25,190
Let's have a conversation.
If I'm wrong,

816
00:33:25,191 --> 00:33:26,660
tell me I'm wrong.
Tell me how I'm wrong.

817
00:33:26,780 --> 00:33:28,280
Give me your data.
Give me your facts.

818
00:33:28,281 --> 00:33:30,560
Tell me what you got,
and I could quote the,

819
00:33:30,590 --> 00:33:31,423
the Brookings Institution,
which is a liberal think tank and the 

820
00:33:34,460 --> 00:33:35,293
Heritage Foundation,
which is a conservative think tank and 

821
00:33:35,571 --> 00:33:36,404
they will both tell you that there's a 
relationship between crime and bad 

822
00:33:39,801 --> 00:33:41,060
schools,
uh,

823
00:33:41,061 --> 00:33:42,950
and going to prison and not having a 
dad.

824
00:33:42,980 --> 00:33:46,040
So this is not just a liberal kind of 
thing or conservative kind of thing.

825
00:33:46,041 --> 00:33:49,880
It's a real world kind of thing and they
don't want to have that conversation.

826
00:33:49,950 --> 00:33:54,380
I have never heard a reporter ask Obama 
about the connection between the rise of

827
00:33:54,381 --> 00:33:57,420
the single parent household and the rise
of,

828
00:33:57,440 --> 00:33:58,640
of,
of welfare spending.

829
00:33:58,641 --> 00:34:00,530
I've never heard anybody ask him that 
question.

830
00:34:00,650 --> 00:34:01,820
Not one time.
Yeah.

831
00:34:01,850 --> 00:34:03,830
And so as far as I'm concerned,
is this,

832
00:34:03,831 --> 00:34:04,221
this,
this,

833
00:34:04,221 --> 00:34:05,054
this,
um,

834
00:34:05,090 --> 00:34:09,770
desire not to have this conversation for
fear that then will cause you to rethink

835
00:34:09,771 --> 00:34:12,770
your assumptions.
A psychologist would call that cognitive

836
00:34:12,771 --> 00:34:13,750
dissonance the,
the,

837
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:16,550
this,
this anxiety that you feel when you have

838
00:34:16,551 --> 00:34:18,620
had your assumptions challenged and you 
don't want to do it.

839
00:34:18,621 --> 00:34:19,510
It's uncomfortable.
Yeah.

840
00:34:19,610 --> 00:34:23,420
So how then would someone like you or 
someone that believes in what the things

841
00:34:23,421 --> 00:34:24,254
that you're talking about,
how do you wrestle away a little bit of 

842
00:34:26,661 --> 00:34:29,330
the narrative from the black lives 
matter folks,

843
00:34:29,540 --> 00:34:30,373
because obviously you tell them,
I tell the true care about the same 

844
00:34:31,911 --> 00:34:32,550
thing.
Of course I do.

845
00:34:32,550 --> 00:34:34,100
I tell the truth.
I talk about,

846
00:34:34,101 --> 00:34:34,934
uh,
the number one cause of preventable 

847
00:34:36,351 --> 00:34:39,470
death for young white men is car 
accidents.

848
00:34:39,680 --> 00:34:40,513
The number one cause of preventable 
death for young black men is homicide 

849
00:34:43,730 --> 00:34:45,440
committed by other young black men.

850
00:34:45,590 --> 00:34:46,423
I tell the truth,
I give the facts and the facts are 

851
00:34:49,161 --> 00:34:50,220
racist.
Yeah.

852
00:34:50,270 --> 00:34:54,380
So facts or racist Hashtag facts are 
racist,

853
00:34:54,440 --> 00:34:55,430
right?
So,

854
00:34:55,431 --> 00:34:56,420
uh,
you know,

855
00:34:56,421 --> 00:34:57,580
I'm friends with,
uh,

856
00:34:57,620 --> 00:34:59,660
another black conservative,
David Webb,

857
00:34:59,661 --> 00:35:00,494
you probably know Sirius Xm and he's a 
Fox News contributor and I had been 

858
00:35:04,221 --> 00:35:05,054
doing a progressive show awhile back and
I was on with someone and they didn't 

859
00:35:08,601 --> 00:35:11,360
know him personally,
nor knew that I was friends with him and

860
00:35:11,361 --> 00:35:14,390
they kept saying he's the token black 
guy on Fox right now.

861
00:35:14,391 --> 00:35:17,330
I'm sure you get plenty of token boot 
licker,

862
00:35:17,570 --> 00:35:20,210
uncle Tom,
sambo,

863
00:35:20,300 --> 00:35:23,210
sambo.
Tom Coconut as in Brown on the outside,

864
00:35:23,211 --> 00:35:26,150
white on the inside,
a Oreo same concept,

865
00:35:26,370 --> 00:35:29,060
a the antichrist,
and you've got a hold of because they've

866
00:35:29,090 --> 00:35:29,923
got to maligned somebody like me.
I am a bigger threat to their whole 

867
00:35:32,871 --> 00:35:33,704
ideology than almost anybody else.
A black guy who does not believe that 

868
00:35:37,441 --> 00:35:38,274
he's a victim of black guy who believes 
in hard work and personal 

869
00:35:39,811 --> 00:35:40,644
responsibility.

870
00:35:40,770 --> 00:35:42,450
A black guy who doesn't believe in 
handouts.

871
00:35:42,490 --> 00:35:44,670
Black guy doesn't believe in the welfare
state of black guy.

872
00:35:44,671 --> 00:35:45,930
He doesn't believe in affirmative 
action.

873
00:35:46,080 --> 00:35:46,913
I am the antithesis of everything they 
stand for and therefore I can't just be 

874
00:35:49,891 --> 00:35:52,780
dealt with with facts and everybody with
X.

875
00:35:52,860 --> 00:35:55,310
I've got to be maligned.
I've got to be a castaway.

876
00:35:55,380 --> 00:35:57,660
I've got to be treated as as if I'm 
darth vader.

877
00:35:57,780 --> 00:36:00,360
That's what the left does.
So That's interesting.

878
00:36:00,390 --> 00:36:03,540
And again,
this is where I've really struggled with

879
00:36:03,690 --> 00:36:07,970
my guys on the left because in a way 
that is actually showing it's race.

880
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:09,450
Of course it is.
That's right.

881
00:36:09,451 --> 00:36:11,790
Because I don't have the same right to 
have an opinion.

882
00:36:11,791 --> 00:36:14,550
If somebody else.
I've never heard rush limbaugh be called

883
00:36:14,760 --> 00:36:18,570
anti white because he criticizes hillary
and the Left,

884
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:20,820
but I criticize black left people and 
I'm and I'm,

885
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:21,713
I'm anti-black.

886
00:36:21,840 --> 00:36:23,220
It's bigotry.
It's racism.

887
00:36:23,550 --> 00:36:25,860
Calling somebody.
An uncle Tom is as offensive.

888
00:36:25,861 --> 00:36:28,480
It's calling somebody an inward lover.
Yeah.

889
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:33,210
So when it comes to,
to the black community and politics.

890
00:36:33,450 --> 00:36:36,360
So I got you on a bunch of bunch of this
stuff.

891
00:36:36,630 --> 00:36:37,463
The black community in a lot of ways 
isn't for some of the things that the 

892
00:36:40,770 --> 00:36:41,281
Democratic Party is for,
right?

893
00:36:41,281 --> 00:36:43,260
Because the black community a lot of 
times,

894
00:36:43,261 --> 00:36:46,980
and it has a lot to do with the church 
is more socially conservative.

895
00:36:47,010 --> 00:36:47,843
The only thing that that connects black 
people to the Democratic Party in my 

896
00:36:51,331 --> 00:36:52,164
opinion,
is this notion of social justice and 

897
00:36:54,091 --> 00:36:56,490
this notion that racism remains a major 
problem in America.

898
00:36:56,640 --> 00:36:57,473
Look down the list of,
of things that black people like and 

899
00:36:59,790 --> 00:37:00,623
support.
Blacks are more pro life than whites 

900
00:37:03,271 --> 00:37:06,030
are.
Blacks were more anti gay marriage,

901
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:06,990
uh,
than,

902
00:37:06,990 --> 00:37:07,823
than whites were.
That's one of the reasons its 

903
00:37:08,731 --> 00:37:09,564
proposition passed here in California is
because of the way blacks and browns 

904
00:37:11,581 --> 00:37:12,090
voted.

905
00:37:12,090 --> 00:37:13,110
Again,
I didn't vote that way,

906
00:37:13,111 --> 00:37:14,580
but it's the way a lot of blacks and 
browns did.

907
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:16,350
Um,
uh,

908
00:37:17,370 --> 00:37:18,203
blacks want to be wealthy.
One of the reason Donald Trump is 

909
00:37:20,461 --> 00:37:23,010
getting about 25 percent of black,
which is five times by the way,

910
00:37:23,020 --> 00:37:23,853
the percentage that Mitt Romney got is 
because of Donald Trump's swagger and 

911
00:37:27,451 --> 00:37:28,210
his,
um,

912
00:37:28,210 --> 00:37:29,220
and his,
uh,

913
00:37:29,580 --> 00:37:31,600
being proud that he's made money.
Uh,

914
00:37:31,620 --> 00:37:34,350
and so and,
and in the inner city,

915
00:37:34,410 --> 00:37:36,420
right?
That's a really fascinating little piece

916
00:37:36,421 --> 00:37:38,280
right there because I never want one 
more quick one.

917
00:37:38,281 --> 00:37:39,114
This is important.
The Democratic Party is completely 

918
00:37:41,851 --> 00:37:43,800
beholden to the teacher's union and vice
versa.

919
00:37:44,090 --> 00:37:44,923
Uh,
the union is adamantly opposed to 

920
00:37:46,021 --> 00:37:48,570
vouchers where the money follows the kid
rather than the other way around.

921
00:37:48,870 --> 00:37:52,800
Inner city black women and fathers and 
their inner city,

922
00:37:52,830 --> 00:37:53,663
black,
Brown women and Brown fathers want 

923
00:37:55,230 --> 00:37:57,930
vouchers.
They realized the schools suck.

924
00:37:58,140 --> 00:38:00,690
I went to crenshaw high school in south 
central right now,

925
00:38:00,810 --> 00:38:01,800
three percent.

926
00:38:01,830 --> 00:38:02,663
That's not a typo.
Three percent of kids can do math at 

927
00:38:04,921 --> 00:38:05,754
grade level.
I'm going to send my kid to that school 

928
00:38:07,290 --> 00:38:09,390
because I don't have enough money to 
send my kid to a better school.

929
00:38:10,110 --> 00:38:10,920
It's,
it's,

930
00:38:10,920 --> 00:38:12,740
it's an assault,
a.

931
00:38:12,780 --> 00:38:16,590
there's a program called the DC hope 
scholarship program where every year,

932
00:38:17,420 --> 00:38:19,200
uh,
parents who subscribed to the,

933
00:38:19,230 --> 00:38:20,063
to the program,
it's four times as many people wanting 

934
00:38:22,171 --> 00:38:26,160
to get in as there are seats,
will give a kids about 10 to $12,000

935
00:38:26,161 --> 00:38:31,161
to go to a non a DC government school.
And every two years when it's over Obama

936
00:38:31,711 --> 00:38:33,270
and the Democrats climate try to shut it
down.

937
00:38:33,420 --> 00:38:36,220
And the reason they don't is a bunch of 
black parents go to the streets,

938
00:38:36,310 --> 00:38:37,570
have a press conference,
dark crying.

939
00:38:37,571 --> 00:38:38,404
And so all my kids doing better.
I can't think of anything more damaging 

940
00:38:43,420 --> 00:38:44,253
to a kid's future,
is to send him to a school where it's a 

941
00:38:47,501 --> 00:38:50,150
crip school where the kids are,
are,

942
00:38:50,210 --> 00:38:52,780
are not learning where a lot of them are
not learning because they don't care.

943
00:38:53,020 --> 00:38:53,853
And where the whole level is now dumbed 
down to cater to that lowest common 

944
00:38:58,361 --> 00:39:00,460
denominator in a class.
And as a result,

945
00:39:00,461 --> 00:39:04,810
you have kids that have a poor sat 
scores and they otherwise would,

946
00:39:04,811 --> 00:39:07,090
if they had a chance to go somewhere 
else that challenged them.

947
00:39:07,570 --> 00:39:10,360
Um,
and so inner city parents want vouchers.

948
00:39:10,570 --> 00:39:15,570
Young black people when they're told 
about the benefits of privatizing social

949
00:39:15,791 --> 00:39:16,740
security,
uh,

950
00:39:16,770 --> 00:39:21,770
want to do it because 65 years old 
blacks die sooner than whites do.

951
00:39:22,570 --> 00:39:25,990
And when you die,
all your contribution to social security

952
00:39:25,991 --> 00:39:26,824
go poof,
as opposed to being able to distill it 

953
00:39:28,511 --> 00:39:30,760
to your child.
When black duck taught about this,

954
00:39:30,761 --> 00:39:31,594
young blacks want the opportunity to put
their money into an account that they 

955
00:39:33,761 --> 00:39:35,800
can control.
So when they get 65 years old,

956
00:39:35,801 --> 00:39:39,550
they have real money.
So privatizing social security vouchers,

957
00:39:39,690 --> 00:39:41,890
a abortion,
same sex marriage,

958
00:39:41,950 --> 00:39:42,783
all of these issues,
black are really not in lockstep with 

959
00:39:45,011 --> 00:39:45,844
the Democratic Party,
but the Democratic Party has 

960
00:39:47,201 --> 00:39:48,330
successfully,
uh,

961
00:39:48,610 --> 00:39:51,310
convinced blacks that racism,
this white cop,

962
00:39:51,490 --> 00:39:52,323
this is widespread,
that man's out to get you and vote for 

963
00:39:55,061 --> 00:39:56,140
us and we'll deal with it.

964
00:39:56,410 --> 00:40:00,340
So how much of this is a messaging?
Probably if I grant you all of that,

965
00:40:00,341 --> 00:40:01,174
right?
How much of this is just a messaging 

966
00:40:02,351 --> 00:40:04,660
problem by the Republicans because it 
seems to me,

967
00:40:04,661 --> 00:40:05,494
and I've said this several times,
but someone like Tim Scott who is a 

968
00:40:08,261 --> 00:40:12,020
black Republican senator from the south,
right?

969
00:40:12,340 --> 00:40:14,680
He should be a hero,
not only of the black community,

970
00:40:14,681 --> 00:40:16,510
but he should really be a hero of the 
left.

971
00:40:16,870 --> 00:40:19,630
Right?
Because this is a successful black.

972
00:40:19,650 --> 00:40:21,460
Could be an American hero.
He really should be.

973
00:40:21,461 --> 00:40:22,240
I mean,
he should some,

974
00:40:22,240 --> 00:40:26,050
certainly at least at the very least be 
bigger in the national debate.

975
00:40:26,051 --> 00:40:28,870
Why isn't he a bigger surrogate for 
whoever he's going to support?

976
00:40:28,871 --> 00:40:31,010
I assume it will be a republican.
Uh,

977
00:40:31,150 --> 00:40:33,640
why is this guy lost in,
in the scheme of things?

978
00:40:33,670 --> 00:40:34,503
Well,
it's the same reason that black vote 95 

979
00:40:36,311 --> 00:40:39,110
percent for the Democratic Party,
he is considered to be a,

980
00:40:39,130 --> 00:40:40,000
an uncle Tom.

981
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:41,860
He's a Republican.
He's a black Republican,

982
00:40:41,861 --> 00:40:42,431
a,
he's a,

983
00:40:42,431 --> 00:40:44,680
he's a,
he's some sort of Unicorn.

984
00:40:44,681 --> 00:40:45,790
I don't know what he is,
that,

985
00:40:45,800 --> 00:40:47,020
that's how,
that's how they feel.

986
00:40:47,110 --> 00:40:47,943
So then what do you do?
What do you do as a Republican to break 

987
00:40:50,770 --> 00:40:51,521
this narrative?
You know,

988
00:40:51,521 --> 00:40:52,260
I got it.
You told,

989
00:40:52,260 --> 00:40:53,270
tell the truth.
I got it.

990
00:40:53,271 --> 00:40:54,104
You tell the truth,
but obviously there has to be something 

991
00:40:55,961 --> 00:40:58,210
bigger than messaging here because.
Well,

992
00:40:58,220 --> 00:40:59,320
it telling me the numbers.
90,

993
00:40:59,321 --> 00:41:01,300
95,
it's an uphill fight.

994
00:41:01,301 --> 00:41:02,134
I mean,
to me there is a access of 

995
00:41:03,941 --> 00:41:04,774
indoctrination and you have the media,
you have academia and you have 

996
00:41:07,001 --> 00:41:08,020
Hollywood,
uh,

997
00:41:08,080 --> 00:41:10,540
all of which tell black people that 
they're victims.

998
00:41:10,770 --> 00:41:12,940
Um,
most professors are to the left.

999
00:41:13,180 --> 00:41:14,013
Um,
the media certainly is off to the left 

1000
00:41:15,640 --> 00:41:16,473
and holly was to the left.
And so you get up and you're 

1001
00:41:19,361 --> 00:41:22,960
indoctrinated all the time with things 
like social justice,

1002
00:41:22,961 --> 00:41:24,480
inequality,
uh,

1003
00:41:24,640 --> 00:41:27,580
the man's out to get you a,
we need a higher minimum wage.

1004
00:41:27,580 --> 00:41:29,100
You name the left wing,
uh,

1005
00:41:29,190 --> 00:41:31,090
a policy and,
and you,

1006
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:32,033
and you pick it up through osmosis.
That's why when we first started the 

1007
00:41:33,771 --> 00:41:35,180
conversation,
I said,

1008
00:41:35,181 --> 00:41:37,310
I hope to move you towards the center 
and you say,

1009
00:41:37,311 --> 00:41:38,920
I hope to move you towards,
uh,

1010
00:41:38,990 --> 00:41:40,220
towards the,
towards the center.

1011
00:41:40,430 --> 00:41:41,720
And I said,
it's not going to happen because.

1012
00:41:42,440 --> 00:41:43,273
Because I'm there,
there's nothing you can tell me I 

1013
00:41:45,081 --> 00:41:45,914
haven't heard.
But I probably can say some things your 

1014
00:41:46,851 --> 00:41:49,970
audience hasn't heard a because La 
Times,

1015
00:41:49,971 --> 00:41:51,380
New York Times,
CNN,

1016
00:41:51,860 --> 00:41:52,850
ABC,
NBC,

1017
00:41:52,851 --> 00:41:54,320
CBS,
New York Times,

1018
00:41:54,490 --> 00:41:55,311
uh,
you name it,

1019
00:41:55,311 --> 00:41:57,230
these are all to the left,
whatever,

1020
00:41:57,260 --> 00:41:59,430
left wing position,
uh,

1021
00:41:59,450 --> 00:42:02,030
you're going to hear it,
you're going to hear a why,

1022
00:42:02,031 --> 00:42:02,970
how and where,
but,

1023
00:42:03,040 --> 00:42:07,550
but the other position you won't hear 
unless you watch a Fox News or listen to

1024
00:42:07,551 --> 00:42:11,090
talk radio and a lot of people won't do 
it if you make them,

1025
00:42:11,120 --> 00:42:11,840
if you pay them.

1026
00:42:11,840 --> 00:42:12,673
Right.
So I hope it's clear in our 40 minutes 

1027
00:42:13,941 --> 00:42:16,580
or so together so far when I say I'm on 
the left,

1028
00:42:16,581 --> 00:42:20,240
I consider myself a classic liberal and 
that I stand for liberal principles.

1029
00:42:20,360 --> 00:42:22,250
John Stuart mill type liberal.
Exactly,

1030
00:42:22,251 --> 00:42:22,930
exactly.
That's,

1031
00:42:22,930 --> 00:42:23,840
that's not a liberal.
And,

1032
00:42:23,841 --> 00:42:26,360
and I know in a lot of ways that that 
makes you a conservative.

1033
00:42:27,040 --> 00:42:29,450
You're a Jack Kennedy,
kind of a kind of Democrat.

1034
00:42:29,570 --> 00:42:32,000
He cut taxes.
He was a cold warrior.

1035
00:42:32,720 --> 00:42:33,620
He will.
He liked hunting.

1036
00:42:33,650 --> 00:42:36,020
He liked the second amendment.
So it doesn't really show you how stupid

1037
00:42:36,021 --> 00:42:38,270
the words are.
So what I did at the top of the no shows

1038
00:42:38,271 --> 00:42:42,140
you how the Democratic Party has evolved
to the left and abandoned principles.

1039
00:42:42,141 --> 00:42:43,610
My mom was a,
was a Democrat,

1040
00:42:43,700 --> 00:42:47,000
my mom was a Republican,
my dad was a republican all his life and

1041
00:42:47,001 --> 00:42:49,490
my mom stopped voting for the Democratic
Party and she said,

1042
00:42:49,670 --> 00:42:52,340
as many people have said,
I didn't leave the Democratic Party.

1043
00:42:52,340 --> 00:42:54,650
They left me.
She didn't like welfare.

1044
00:42:54,651 --> 00:42:55,484
She didn't like the idea of rewarding 
people just because you had a kid and 

1045
00:42:58,731 --> 00:43:00,450
they'd given you more money when you had
an additional kids.

1046
00:43:00,460 --> 00:43:01,293
She didn't like any of all of that and 
she started voting for George w Bush or 

1047
00:43:03,531 --> 00:43:04,070
last,
uh,

1048
00:43:04,070 --> 00:43:05,300
two,
two election cycles.

1049
00:43:05,360 --> 00:43:07,250
So it's really ironic that it's not 
messaging.

1050
00:43:07,251 --> 00:43:08,084
It's the fact that the country and the 
country in general has gone to the left 

1051
00:43:11,270 --> 00:43:12,103
and the Democrats to the,
to a greater degree than Republicans 

1052
00:43:14,001 --> 00:43:16,190
have gone to the left.
The country has changed in part,

1053
00:43:16,191 --> 00:43:17,630
in my opinion,
because of immigration,

1054
00:43:17,780 --> 00:43:18,613
including illegal immigration.
People who are coming to the country 

1055
00:43:20,811 --> 00:43:22,880
illegally from third world countries 
like Mexico.

1056
00:43:23,150 --> 00:43:26,390
They don't know what I'm talking about 
when I talk about limited government.

1057
00:43:26,540 --> 00:43:29,630
They believe healthcare is a right.
They're taught that in Mexico,

1058
00:43:29,631 --> 00:43:30,464
they're taught that other places and 
they come here in America and they pull 

1059
00:43:32,601 --> 00:43:34,370
that lever for the Democratic Party,
which is why,

1060
00:43:34,371 --> 00:43:35,204
in my opinion,
the left wants borders to be poorest 

1061
00:43:37,460 --> 00:43:40,130
because it changes the country,
changed the electorate,

1062
00:43:40,190 --> 00:43:42,290
it changes the demographics and all 
that.

1063
00:43:42,320 --> 00:43:45,320
The Democratic Party has not won the 
white vote since 1964.

1064
00:43:45,440 --> 00:43:47,150
The more white people there are in the 
country,

1065
00:43:47,270 --> 00:43:49,040
the worst Democrats do.
The more left wing,

1066
00:43:49,190 --> 00:43:50,960
the more people of color there are in 
the country,

1067
00:43:51,110 --> 00:43:51,943
the best the left does.
And so what incentive is there for them 

1068
00:43:53,871 --> 00:43:55,400
to,
to police the borders?

1069
00:43:55,550 --> 00:43:58,520
What incentive is there for them to shut
down on sanctuary cities,

1070
00:43:58,650 --> 00:43:59,170
uh,
to,

1071
00:43:59,170 --> 00:44:00,920
to stop catch and release?
There isn't,

1072
00:44:01,100 --> 00:44:01,933
in my opinion,
there's been a very subtle and very 

1073
00:44:04,160 --> 00:44:08,270
diabolical changing or the mentality of 
this country by left wing people so that

1074
00:44:08,271 --> 00:44:09,104
a state like California could never vote
for Ronald Reagan as they did in the 

1075
00:44:11,661 --> 00:44:12,494
past,
could never vote for Richard Nixon as 

1076
00:44:13,341 --> 00:44:14,174
they did in the past.
You have New York and California just 

1077
00:44:17,060 --> 00:44:20,360
write them off and there's 10 or 12 
states now that we fight over.

1078
00:44:20,361 --> 00:44:22,730
Everything else has now written off.
It's ridiculous.

1079
00:44:22,790 --> 00:44:23,623
So at the top of the show,
when I was laying out some of the 

1080
00:44:24,921 --> 00:44:26,420
principles that we're talking about 
here,

1081
00:44:26,421 --> 00:44:31,040
I saw classical liberalism falling into 
the conservative category,

1082
00:44:31,050 --> 00:44:31,883
as you just said.

1083
00:44:32,100 --> 00:44:32,933
And it's funny because while I consider 
myself a classical liberal and we can 

1084
00:44:35,761 --> 00:44:38,070
lay out every liberal principle there is
that I would defend.

1085
00:44:38,340 --> 00:44:39,270
Uh,
it's,

1086
00:44:39,390 --> 00:44:40,223
it's scary to me because the.
Because we get so caught up in words 

1087
00:44:43,470 --> 00:44:44,430
that,
you know,

1088
00:44:44,460 --> 00:44:45,293
oh,
I don't want to be considered a 

1089
00:44:45,991 --> 00:44:49,980
conservative because I'm a liberal.
It's a scary proposition,

1090
00:44:50,100 --> 00:44:50,790
right?
Well,

1091
00:44:50,790 --> 00:44:51,640
again,
it's,

1092
00:44:51,670 --> 00:44:52,503
it's,
it's about limited government personal 

1093
00:44:53,641 --> 00:44:54,474
responsibility as far as I'm concerned.
What you've told me is that you are 

1094
00:44:56,641 --> 00:44:57,474
really a,
somebody on my camp far more so than 

1095
00:44:59,971 --> 00:45:01,950
somebody on Bernie Sanders camp.
Well,

1096
00:45:01,951 --> 00:45:02,784
I'm liberal in that I'm for gay marriage
and I don't mind if you smoke weed in 

1097
00:45:06,241 --> 00:45:09,720
your bedroom as a general rule.
I do like lower taxes,

1098
00:45:09,721 --> 00:45:12,630
but I think we could have a progressive 
tax at some level,

1099
00:45:12,631 --> 00:45:14,640
so we probably disagree a little bit 
there.

1100
00:45:14,641 --> 00:45:15,474
I do think you should if you keep making
more and more and especially as you're 

1101
00:45:17,521 --> 00:45:20,280
getting into the dozens of millions and 
hundreds of millions.

1102
00:45:20,281 --> 00:45:21,114
Yeah,
we could have a progressive tax that 

1103
00:45:21,961 --> 00:45:22,794
would attack the taxes people more.
I'm not necessarily for the 90 percent 

1104
00:45:25,890 --> 00:45:28,170
tax that,
that Bernie wants.

1105
00:45:28,260 --> 00:45:29,880
Uh,
so I,

1106
00:45:29,881 --> 00:45:30,910
you know,
some of the economics.

1107
00:45:31,600 --> 00:45:33,120
I wonder,
let me ask you,

1108
00:45:33,121 --> 00:45:35,520
why is it that nobody gave Dick Cheney 
love?

1109
00:45:35,550 --> 00:45:40,530
Because Cheney had a more progressive 
position on same sex marriage than Obama

1110
00:45:40,531 --> 00:45:42,200
did when Obama was still.
But we're changing,

1111
00:45:42,450 --> 00:45:43,283
evolving.
Cheney Cheney didn't have it until he 

1112
00:45:44,731 --> 00:45:46,230
was out of office.
So that's,

1113
00:45:46,270 --> 00:45:46,870
uh,
you know,

1114
00:45:46,870 --> 00:45:48,530
it's a little disingenuous.
What he did,

1115
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:52,170
he still years before Obama said he was 
in favor of gay marriage,

1116
00:45:52,260 --> 00:45:53,093
said,
I'm in favor of allowing states to 

1117
00:45:54,901 --> 00:45:57,530
determine this.
He said that years before that,

1118
00:45:57,540 --> 00:45:58,710
while he was in office,
though,

1119
00:45:58,760 --> 00:45:59,593
I don't think that was while he was all 
I know was years before Obama because 

1120
00:46:02,520 --> 00:46:03,353
Obama became president 2008.
He's not only said that he was in favor 

1121
00:46:06,421 --> 00:46:09,090
of traditional marriage.
He said God was in the mix.

1122
00:46:09,180 --> 00:46:13,930
All of a sudden years later,
God is no longer mix four years ago.

1123
00:46:13,940 --> 00:46:14,910
Then God got out of the mix.

1124
00:46:14,910 --> 00:46:15,743
But anyway,
the point is that Dick Cheney said that 

1125
00:46:17,671 --> 00:46:20,670
he supported same sex marriage on a 
state by state basis.

1126
00:46:20,820 --> 00:46:21,653
Well before the left,
did well before Obama did well before 

1127
00:46:24,391 --> 00:46:25,224
Hillary did gotten olaf.
So isn't actually well that I think 

1128
00:46:28,861 --> 00:46:30,810
would just go to.
Because politicians are pandering.

1129
00:46:30,811 --> 00:46:31,644
I mean that.
I don't know that that makes Obama 

1130
00:46:33,040 --> 00:46:35,050
anymore of a liar than any other 
politician make.

1131
00:46:35,160 --> 00:46:36,700
As much as they will just talk.
I'm telling you,

1132
00:46:36,720 --> 00:46:37,650
I'm paying,
I'm talking about.

1133
00:46:37,651 --> 00:46:38,484
I get you.
I'm talking about why somebody didn't 

1134
00:46:40,111 --> 00:46:42,240
give it.
Give it a couple of attaboys on that.

1135
00:46:42,270 --> 00:46:43,103
I know that people on the left hate him,
called him a neocon and believe he was 

1136
00:46:45,961 --> 00:46:49,290
whispering and George w Bush's ear and 
got Bush to do all sorts of bad things,

1137
00:46:49,410 --> 00:46:50,243
but I would've,
I would've thought on this issue since 

1138
00:46:51,391 --> 00:46:53,370
the left considered such,
such an important issue.

1139
00:46:53,490 --> 00:46:54,450
I don't,
by the way,

1140
00:46:55,320 --> 00:46:57,230
that they would not have given it a 
little bit of bit.

1141
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:00,920
What do you mean you don't consider same
sex marriage to be that big of a deal?

1142
00:47:00,950 --> 00:47:04,810
To me it's a give people equality and 
then let's not think about it anymore.

1143
00:47:04,811 --> 00:47:05,530
That would.

1144
00:47:05,530 --> 00:47:06,810
Fair enough.
I'm just saying I,

1145
00:47:06,840 --> 00:47:09,450
I think the number one issue in this 
country is self defense.

1146
00:47:09,690 --> 00:47:10,240
Uh,
and,

1147
00:47:10,240 --> 00:47:12,090
and the number one domestic policy issue
that,

1148
00:47:12,091 --> 00:47:13,740
as I mentioned,
is the destruction of the family.

1149
00:47:13,890 --> 00:47:16,350
These other things,
a same sex marriage,

1150
00:47:16,351 --> 00:47:18,750
war on drugs,
a global warming.

1151
00:47:18,751 --> 00:47:20,160
I considered to be further down the 
list.

1152
00:47:20,490 --> 00:47:21,330
So the war on drugs,
you're,

1153
00:47:21,331 --> 00:47:23,190
you're actually for legalizing drugs,
right?

1154
00:47:23,260 --> 00:47:25,680
I'm,
I'm for the government getting out of it

1155
00:47:25,681 --> 00:47:27,870
both federally and at the state level.
Yeah.

1156
00:47:27,930 --> 00:47:31,480
And that would be an interestingly,
this may be a little boring for your,

1157
00:47:31,510 --> 00:47:32,380
for your viewers,
but,

1158
00:47:32,710 --> 00:47:33,880
but um,
uh,

1159
00:47:33,910 --> 00:47:36,730
in the,
in the earlier in the 20th century,

1160
00:47:36,731 --> 00:47:41,290
we had the war against alcohol.
The constitution was amended,

1161
00:47:42,520 --> 00:47:43,810
the fight,
the war against alcohol,

1162
00:47:44,200 --> 00:47:46,570
and then it was amended again when we 
decided it didn't work.

1163
00:47:47,050 --> 00:47:48,670
We've had,
since Richard Nixon,

1164
00:47:48,671 --> 00:47:49,504
this war on drugs,
the constitution was never amended for 

1165
00:47:52,421 --> 00:47:53,254
that.

1166
00:47:53,500 --> 00:47:54,333
And I don't understand why people don't 
make the argument that it is illegal 

1167
00:47:57,730 --> 00:48:02,730
what the federal government is doing 
because in order to get rid of alcohol,

1168
00:48:03,550 --> 00:48:06,130
Congress knew that they had to change 
the constitution,

1169
00:48:06,131 --> 00:48:09,160
which they did.
There's no power in article one,

1170
00:48:09,161 --> 00:48:09,994
section eight that gives the federal 
government the authority to wage a war 

1171
00:48:12,011 --> 00:48:14,740
on alcohol or a war on,
on,

1172
00:48:14,950 --> 00:48:16,990
on drugs.
But to do the one on alcohol,

1173
00:48:16,991 --> 00:48:19,240
they changed the constitution and then 
rechanged it.

1174
00:48:19,241 --> 00:48:21,280
But they never did that for the war on 
drugs.

1175
00:48:21,370 --> 00:48:23,950
Yeah.
So how much of that do you think goes to

1176
00:48:24,100 --> 00:48:26,290
why the black family has been affected?
I mean,

1177
00:48:26,291 --> 00:48:28,540
when you think about the amount of black
people,

1178
00:48:28,541 --> 00:48:29,374
black men especially,
and minorities in general that are in 

1179
00:48:31,541 --> 00:48:32,374
jail,
we now have pro for profit jails and a 

1180
00:48:34,631 --> 00:48:37,420
huge percentage of these people are in 
jail because of drug offenses.

1181
00:48:37,660 --> 00:48:39,880
Well,
not that many about 12 to 15 percent,

1182
00:48:39,910 --> 00:48:40,390
but,
but,

1183
00:48:40,390 --> 00:48:41,240
but,
but whatever.

1184
00:48:41,360 --> 00:48:43,450
That seems pretty significant,
whatever the percentage is,

1185
00:48:43,451 --> 00:48:44,284
I think the war on drugs should be 
rethought and we should deal with it as 

1186
00:48:46,091 --> 00:48:47,890
a health problem and not a criminal 
justice problem,

1187
00:48:48,220 --> 00:48:49,053
but the reason for the large number of 
black behind bars goes back to what I 

1188
00:48:52,871 --> 00:48:55,000
said earlier about the breakdown of the 
black family,

1189
00:48:55,350 --> 00:48:56,183
uh,
and not being taught the right kinds of 

1190
00:48:57,221 --> 00:48:58,170
values.
Uh,

1191
00:48:58,190 --> 00:49:00,580
and that has all sorts of other social 
consequences including,

1192
00:49:00,581 --> 00:49:02,980
uh,
a greater propensity to commit crime.

1193
00:49:03,130 --> 00:49:03,963
Yeah.
Um,

1194
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:04,833
all right,
let's back up for a second because you 

1195
00:49:05,800 --> 00:49:06,633
quickly say something about Hollywood 
and I know I follow you on twitter and 

1196
00:49:09,580 --> 00:49:11,220
you rail against Hollywood.
All I do.

1197
00:49:11,440 --> 00:49:14,500
Basically your argument is that it's 
like kicking a puppy though.

1198
00:49:14,890 --> 00:49:16,850
It's become,
and I can tell you not.

1199
00:49:17,050 --> 00:49:18,300
It's not that difficult.
Right.

1200
00:49:18,301 --> 00:49:19,780
So,
so just the other night,

1201
00:49:19,781 --> 00:49:20,560
you know,
you were,

1202
00:49:20,560 --> 00:49:21,393
you were tweeting a little bit about the
Golden Globes and the targets that your 

1203
00:49:23,391 --> 00:49:25,720
base was taking.
Last night I saw you,

1204
00:49:25,730 --> 00:49:27,550
uh,
on CNN,

1205
00:49:27,551 --> 00:49:28,384
Don Lemon,
who I had on last week was on the show 

1206
00:49:29,621 --> 00:49:30,454
last week.
He was talking about Tavis Smiley and 

1207
00:49:32,801 --> 00:49:35,860
you're not a fan of travis.
I've known him a long time.

1208
00:49:35,861 --> 00:49:36,840
He's a,
he,

1209
00:49:36,841 --> 00:49:38,870
he doesn't preach what he practices,
what he is,

1210
00:49:38,920 --> 00:49:39,753
a hardworking guy who came from Indiana 
with a big poor family and has done 

1211
00:49:43,301 --> 00:49:45,160
quite well with his life.
And instead of telling people,

1212
00:49:45,161 --> 00:49:46,480
bust your butt,
do what I did.

1213
00:49:46,481 --> 00:49:47,920
Work hard,
stay focused.

1214
00:49:47,921 --> 00:49:50,440
It's demands out to get you a social 
injustice.

1215
00:49:50,441 --> 00:49:51,670
Racism,
racism everywhere.

1216
00:49:51,671 --> 00:49:52,504
It's nonsense.
Hollywood is an easy target because 

1217
00:49:54,551 --> 00:49:56,390
these guys,
the Golden Globes,

1218
00:49:56,391 --> 00:49:58,840
they've got these fine clothing 
designer,

1219
00:49:59,140 --> 00:50:01,270
a clothing and designed designer Tux 
and,

1220
00:50:01,271 --> 00:50:02,350
and their jewelry.

1221
00:50:02,980 --> 00:50:03,813
They're all anti second amendment,
but they're all protected by armed 

1222
00:50:05,861 --> 00:50:07,340
security guard.
Uh,

1223
00:50:07,410 --> 00:50:09,370
and um,
how many of them,

1224
00:50:09,560 --> 00:50:10,393
uh,
applied into a Prius to get to and from 

1225
00:50:12,161 --> 00:50:12,940
the,
uh,

1226
00:50:12,940 --> 00:50:13,251
uh,
the,

1227
00:50:13,251 --> 00:50:14,320
the,
the ceremony.

1228
00:50:14,321 --> 00:50:16,900
I mean,
you're saying very few.

1229
00:50:16,901 --> 00:50:18,160
I think very,
very few.

1230
00:50:18,340 --> 00:50:21,010
They in big gas.
Guzzling not a large number of limos.

1231
00:50:21,030 --> 00:50:22,660
Yeah.
And notice it.

1232
00:50:22,661 --> 00:50:24,520
Notice there were several bill cosby 
jokes,

1233
00:50:24,521 --> 00:50:26,470
I think three or four bill cosby rape 
jokes.

1234
00:50:26,740 --> 00:50:29,180
Not One Bill Clinton rape joke.
Poor quality.

1235
00:50:29,380 --> 00:50:30,213
Yeah.
Yeah.

1236
00:50:30,590 --> 00:50:32,330
Uh,
do you think,

1237
00:50:32,331 --> 00:50:33,164
I mean,
I'm a firm believer that a lot of them 

1238
00:50:34,131 --> 00:50:34,964
actually privately are supporting 
Republicans or at least their voting 

1239
00:50:37,431 --> 00:50:39,770
Republican.
There is this idea that,

1240
00:50:39,771 --> 00:50:41,140
okay,
we're going to go on this.

1241
00:50:41,330 --> 00:50:44,500
You can't say you can't say it out loud.
Name One,

1242
00:50:44,570 --> 00:50:45,403
a list.
Young actor or actress who's an out of 

1243
00:50:47,871 --> 00:50:50,330
the closet Republican.
Just one young,

1244
00:50:51,100 --> 00:50:52,000
20,
30 eastern.

1245
00:50:52,370 --> 00:50:54,260
You can do it once.
Your Clint Eastwood,

1246
00:50:54,261 --> 00:50:56,910
once your Kelsey grammer boy,
does it count as you,

1247
00:50:56,960 --> 00:50:57,793
right?
No,

1248
00:50:58,510 --> 00:50:58,960
no,
but,

1249
00:50:58,960 --> 00:51:00,080
but somebody in his twenties,
thirties,

1250
00:51:00,260 --> 00:51:01,440
Jennifer Lawrence,
uh,

1251
00:51:01,460 --> 00:51:04,230
age star,
they want this guy to be somebody.

1252
00:51:04,790 --> 00:51:05,623
They can't be 100 percent a left wing,
but they will not say so because they 

1253
00:51:08,901 --> 00:51:09,734
know they won't get parts and you would 
say that's not necessarily because they 

1254
00:51:13,281 --> 00:51:16,280
believe those things as much as just the
structures in place.

1255
00:51:16,320 --> 00:51:19,010
It's bigotry in Hollywood that the open 
minded,

1256
00:51:19,011 --> 00:51:19,844
empathetic people,
they're fine as long as you don't say 

1257
00:51:22,191 --> 00:51:23,990
something that pisses them off.
Yeah.

1258
00:51:24,230 --> 00:51:24,821
And,
and,

1259
00:51:24,821 --> 00:51:26,210
uh,
you say that you're gonna support,

1260
00:51:26,211 --> 00:51:27,320
uh,
uh,

1261
00:51:27,500 --> 00:51:28,850
uh,
Donald Trump,

1262
00:51:29,180 --> 00:51:31,700
you won't work if you're 20 or 30 years 
old.

1263
00:51:31,850 --> 00:51:33,860
You won't work.
You're going to lose jobs.

1264
00:51:33,920 --> 00:51:34,753
Yeah.
So let's talk a little bit about your 

1265
00:51:35,290 --> 00:51:37,430
thoughts and think and think about that.
These are,

1266
00:51:37,490 --> 00:51:38,323
these are the people who are in charge 
of 80 percent of what we see on TV and 

1267
00:51:43,370 --> 00:51:45,020
on and in movies.

1268
00:51:45,110 --> 00:51:45,943
And if you come out and you're 20 or 30 
years old and you're a rising star and 

1269
00:51:49,431 --> 00:51:50,264
you say,
you know what?

1270
00:51:50,420 --> 00:51:51,860
Listen to Larry elder's show the other 
day.

1271
00:51:51,880 --> 00:51:52,713
I think,
um,

1272
00:51:53,030 --> 00:51:54,830
I'm going to vote Republican.
Finished,

1273
00:51:55,070 --> 00:51:56,810
done,
done now.

1274
00:51:56,811 --> 00:51:57,644
Now,
what kind of power is that to influence 

1275
00:51:59,840 --> 00:52:03,140
the minds of young people to shape this 
country culturally,

1276
00:52:03,260 --> 00:52:04,093
it is massive.
There was a book called Primetime 

1277
00:52:05,570 --> 00:52:07,940
propaganda by a young man named Ben 
Shapiro.

1278
00:52:08,840 --> 00:52:09,673
We're getting them on the show and uh,
and because he looks so young and looks 

1279
00:52:13,041 --> 00:52:14,330
liberal,
whatever that means,

1280
00:52:14,420 --> 00:52:17,630
he was able to get on the record all 
these Hollywood producers,

1281
00:52:17,631 --> 00:52:21,710
people that did golden girls,
people that did cops and got them on the

1282
00:52:21,711 --> 00:52:25,400
record saying,
I would never hire a conservative.

1283
00:52:25,520 --> 00:52:27,620
A conservative in this town will be 
screwed.

1284
00:52:27,800 --> 00:52:29,750
A conservative in this town cannot make 
it.

1285
00:52:29,930 --> 00:52:32,810
I intentionally put leftwing messages in
my fair.

1286
00:52:32,930 --> 00:52:33,763
I try to influence culture this way,
has them all saying this and has an on 

1287
00:52:37,341 --> 00:52:40,340
tape.
And the book came out and it didn't make

1288
00:52:40,490 --> 00:52:41,960
any difference.
They didn't say,

1289
00:52:41,961 --> 00:52:42,794
I'm sorry,
I didn't say we ought to rethink our 

1290
00:52:44,661 --> 00:52:46,670
assumptions.
He interviewed Fred Silverman,

1291
00:52:46,790 --> 00:52:48,830
who at one time as the head of ABC,
CBS,

1292
00:52:48,850 --> 00:52:49,683
NBC has Fred Silverman on the record 
saying a conservative cannot make it in 

1293
00:52:53,091 --> 00:52:53,901
this town.
Now,

1294
00:52:53,901 --> 00:52:54,734
if Hollywood has a great impact on how 
we think on our culture and you have 

1295
00:52:58,251 --> 00:53:02,060
this Gestapo essentially shutting out 
people who are conservative,

1296
00:53:02,120 --> 00:53:06,440
what does that say?
It's scary to frightening to me.

1297
00:53:06,470 --> 00:53:06,951
Yeah.
Well,

1298
00:53:06,951 --> 00:53:07,784
messaging messaging is everything,
which actually brings this back to what 

1299
00:53:10,101 --> 00:53:10,934
you said about trump before,
which I think is sort of fascinating 

1300
00:53:12,890 --> 00:53:13,723
that he's polling better with the black 
community is because he has this sense 

1301
00:53:16,911 --> 00:53:17,744
of swagger,
which I think you could probably relate 

1302
00:53:19,280 --> 00:53:20,640
directly back to,
you know,

1303
00:53:20,660 --> 00:53:22,190
rap music and stuff like that.

1304
00:53:22,190 --> 00:53:25,620
These guys aren't,
they're not ashamed of their success and

1305
00:53:25,621 --> 00:53:27,120
that.
So in a weird way,

1306
00:53:27,420 --> 00:53:31,170
trump is sort of doing the exact same 
the exact thing that you want,

1307
00:53:31,440 --> 00:53:32,760
uh,
to happen.

1308
00:53:32,820 --> 00:53:33,653
I agree,
but I think it was another big reason 

1309
00:53:34,561 --> 00:53:37,310
that trump is scoring with white people.
Uh,

1310
00:53:37,620 --> 00:53:38,453
one of the most underpolled things in 
this country is how black people are 

1311
00:53:41,461 --> 00:53:45,270
pissed off about illegal immigration.
When I was younger,

1312
00:53:45,271 --> 00:53:47,700
there was a movie that came out of the 
seventies called carwash,

1313
00:53:48,170 --> 00:53:49,400
or Richard Pryor was in it,
um,

1314
00:53:49,680 --> 00:53:51,240
and George or George Carlin was in it.
Yeah.

1315
00:53:51,540 --> 00:53:54,720
And it was about a day in the life of 
this carwash in south central,

1316
00:53:54,721 --> 00:53:58,620
not too far from where I grew up.
Virtually all the employees were black.

1317
00:53:59,010 --> 00:54:01,920
I defy you to go to a car wash and south
central now and see any,

1318
00:54:01,980 --> 00:54:02,813
any employee who's black illegal 
immigrants that come over and taking 

1319
00:54:05,220 --> 00:54:06,400
over this business,
uh,

1320
00:54:06,580 --> 00:54:07,413
and black people see it and they,
and they realize it and they are angry 

1321
00:54:09,751 --> 00:54:10,340
about it.

1322
00:54:10,340 --> 00:54:12,030
Uh,
and the Democratic Party,

1323
00:54:12,031 --> 00:54:12,864
however,
because of what I said earlier about 

1324
00:54:13,831 --> 00:54:15,360
trying to shift the electorate to the 
left,

1325
00:54:15,580 --> 00:54:16,081
uh,
has,

1326
00:54:16,081 --> 00:54:16,914
in my opinion,
thrown blacks under the bus on this 

1327
00:54:18,241 --> 00:54:19,074
issue.
And a lot of blacks who are aware of it 

1328
00:54:20,820 --> 00:54:21,653
or not happy about it.
And Donald Trump's position on 

1329
00:54:23,131 --> 00:54:24,450
immigration,
uh,

1330
00:54:24,630 --> 00:54:27,990
resonated with a lot of black people.
The other thing about,

1331
00:54:28,020 --> 00:54:30,120
about Donald trump that I think in 
general,

1332
00:54:30,121 --> 00:54:31,360
not just black people,
uh,

1333
00:54:31,440 --> 00:54:32,273
is appealing to me anyway.
And I'm not quite sure why some of my 

1334
00:54:34,711 --> 00:54:38,160
fellow Republicans are so adamantly 
opposed to Donald Trump.

1335
00:54:38,430 --> 00:54:41,190
This guy,
Dave can self fund.

1336
00:54:41,520 --> 00:54:43,680
He doesn't need your money.
Uh,

1337
00:54:43,740 --> 00:54:44,573
Donald Trump was at a group called the 
Republican Jewish coalition and he was 

1338
00:54:47,701 --> 00:54:48,534
asked a question about does he feel that
a Jerusalem should be the undivided 

1339
00:54:51,661 --> 00:54:54,450
capital of Israel?
His answers not important.

1340
00:54:54,480 --> 00:54:55,610
He said something like,
uh,

1341
00:54:55,611 --> 00:54:56,940
I'm not sure I haven't thought it 
through.

1342
00:54:56,940 --> 00:54:59,340
And he got booed and Donald trump looked
up and he said,

1343
00:54:59,640 --> 00:55:00,473
I don't need your money now.
There's a guy named Nelson Sheldon 

1344
00:55:04,440 --> 00:55:05,273
Adelson in Las Vegas.
He's a multibillionaire last election 

1345
00:55:07,620 --> 00:55:08,453
cycle.
He gave Newt Gingrich 10 million a lot 

1346
00:55:10,311 --> 00:55:12,840
of money and a lot of people feel that,
but for that,

1347
00:55:13,320 --> 00:55:14,153
Newt Gingrich is a tackle and Mitt 
Romney and all the footage that he gave 

1348
00:55:17,100 --> 00:55:18,750
Democrats to use and the general 
election,

1349
00:55:18,960 --> 00:55:20,430
Romney might have one.
That's not the point.

1350
00:55:20,580 --> 00:55:23,460
The point is he is a king maker.
Um,

1351
00:55:23,580 --> 00:55:24,413
and right now he is trying to decide 
whether he wants to give money to a Ted 

1352
00:55:29,010 --> 00:55:32,640
Cruz or Marco Rubio.
He has Los Vegas business interests.

1353
00:55:32,910 --> 00:55:35,130
I'm not mad at him for doing something 
to pursue his interests.

1354
00:55:35,190 --> 00:55:36,023
But the point is,
he expected his phone call to return to 

1355
00:55:37,741 --> 00:55:39,510
be returned.
Donald trump can say,

1356
00:55:39,511 --> 00:55:43,110
screw you to all these people,
the people that get subsidized for milk,

1357
00:55:43,260 --> 00:55:44,093
the people that get subsidies for sugar,
the people that get subsidies for this 

1358
00:55:46,081 --> 00:55:48,360
ridiculous product known as ethanol,
uh,

1359
00:55:48,361 --> 00:55:50,460
the,
the unions that keep Amtrak running.

1360
00:55:50,640 --> 00:55:51,473
Donald trump does not need their money.
He does not have to take their phone 

1361
00:55:54,961 --> 00:55:55,794
call.
So what's guy can really do what should 

1362
00:55:57,301 --> 00:56:00,990
be done for the American people,
which is to get all the crony capitalism

1363
00:56:01,140 --> 00:56:01,973
and all these so called special 
interests out of our government and get 

1364
00:56:04,201 --> 00:56:05,034
it down to the site.
That oughta be Boeing gets money from 

1365
00:56:06,781 --> 00:56:08,910
the government.
Google gets money from the government.

1366
00:56:08,940 --> 00:56:10,590
Dutch royal gets money from the 
government.

1367
00:56:10,860 --> 00:56:11,693
This is corporate welfare.
And the reason that happens is because 

1368
00:56:13,471 --> 00:56:14,304
they give contribution to the 
politicians who in turn then do their 

1369
00:56:17,251 --> 00:56:19,710
bidding.
Donald trump does not need their money.

1370
00:56:19,711 --> 00:56:20,544
He is in a position to downsize the 
government in a way unlike any other 

1371
00:56:23,861 --> 00:56:24,400
politician

1372
00:56:24,400 --> 00:56:25,600
I've ever seen.
Yeah.

1373
00:56:25,601 --> 00:56:26,830
So there's the.
I mean,

1374
00:56:26,831 --> 00:56:28,250
there's a lot of irony there.
You've,

1375
00:56:28,330 --> 00:56:29,163
what you're really talking about is 
that's truly systemic political 

1376
00:56:32,560 --> 00:56:33,810
problems.
Tell me about it,

1377
00:56:33,811 --> 00:56:35,740
the money politics study,
so that's,

1378
00:56:35,741 --> 00:56:36,574
and that's.
That should unite everybody across the 

1379
00:56:38,051 --> 00:56:39,880
board about how messed up our system 
should.

1380
00:56:39,881 --> 00:56:40,714
I mean,
right now a la is going to get to team 

1381
00:56:42,580 --> 00:56:43,413
two football teams,
probably Oakland and San Diego and St 

1382
00:56:46,450 --> 00:56:48,160
Louis are all vying to come out here.
By the way,

1383
00:56:48,161 --> 00:56:50,530
all three of them used to play here.
Rams used to play here,

1384
00:56:50,531 --> 00:56:53,560
open up to play here,
and the first a La chargers,

1385
00:56:53,740 --> 00:56:56,240
one of the AFL teams started here and 
they moved to San Diego.

1386
00:56:56,241 --> 00:56:57,640
Now they don't want to come back.
Why?

1387
00:56:57,641 --> 00:56:58,474
Because their respective cities won't 
give them hundreds of billions of 

1388
00:57:01,330 --> 00:57:02,163
dollars in tax subsidies.
Why should a multibillionaire get 

1389
00:57:05,711 --> 00:57:06,544
millions of dollars from taxpayers who 
then in turn have to pay all this to go 

1390
00:57:09,941 --> 00:57:13,600
to the game and watch multimillionaire 
ballplayers be?

1391
00:57:13,840 --> 00:57:15,580
Well,
that's like sitting corporate welfare,

1392
00:57:15,620 --> 00:57:19,150
that's molesting city field where the 
mets play in New York,

1393
00:57:19,151 --> 00:57:22,030
you know that it was funded by,
partly by taxpayer money,

1394
00:57:22,190 --> 00:57:23,023
but meanwhile the government's bailing 
out Citibank who has their name on the 

1395
00:57:25,721 --> 00:57:27,790
whole thing is reduced.
So the trump thing,

1396
00:57:27,791 --> 00:57:28,624
real quick,
one of the things is in the first 

1397
00:57:29,741 --> 00:57:30,574
debate,
the first republican debate about three 

1398
00:57:32,171 --> 00:57:33,710
months ago now,
I thought the,

1399
00:57:33,770 --> 00:57:36,790
the unmasking that he did was actually 
kind of amazing,

1400
00:57:36,791 --> 00:57:38,890
even though I disagree with him on 
pretty much everything,

1401
00:57:38,891 --> 00:57:39,724
but you know,
when they asked him about going to 

1402
00:57:40,721 --> 00:57:42,780
Hillary's a daughter's wedding,
right?

1403
00:57:43,100 --> 00:57:43,933
Uh,
he goes to Chelsea's wedding and he was 

1404
00:57:44,921 --> 00:57:45,671
like,
yeah,

1405
00:57:45,671 --> 00:57:48,100
I give them money.
Show up the wedding.

1406
00:57:48,101 --> 00:57:49,330
Yeah.
I give money to everybody.

1407
00:57:49,331 --> 00:57:50,400
I'm a business guy.
I got it.

1408
00:57:50,520 --> 00:57:52,450
I got to do what I gotta do.
So in a weird way,

1409
00:57:52,451 --> 00:57:53,350
even if you don't like.

1410
00:57:53,350 --> 00:57:54,183
So for my,
for my liberal friends and my friends 

1411
00:57:55,181 --> 00:57:56,014
had left,
even if you hate the messaging and you 

1412
00:57:58,030 --> 00:57:59,770
know,
all the Muslim stuff and all that,

1413
00:57:59,771 --> 00:58:02,080
even if you hate all that,
the unmasking of the system.

1414
00:58:02,081 --> 00:58:02,914
And that's why I've also talked about 
how Bernie and trump have a lot in 

1415
00:58:04,811 --> 00:58:05,644
common because the core of what they're 
doing is the biggest threat to the 

1416
00:58:08,651 --> 00:58:09,390
system.
Right,

1417
00:58:09,390 --> 00:58:12,070
right.
Bernie and trump have a lot in common in

1418
00:58:12,071 --> 00:58:14,350
the sense that the establishment is 
scared to death of both of them.

1419
00:58:14,960 --> 00:58:15,790
Uh,
but,

1420
00:58:15,790 --> 00:58:17,470
uh,
Bernie will make things worse.

1421
00:58:17,920 --> 00:58:20,860
Taking over large corporations will make
things worse.

1422
00:58:20,861 --> 00:58:21,694
Raising taxes on job creators will make 
things worse with Donald trump wants to 

1423
00:58:24,911 --> 00:58:26,500
do.
I will make things better.

1424
00:58:27,530 --> 00:58:28,480
All right.
Well,

1425
00:58:28,540 --> 00:58:29,373
uh,
I barely got to any of the questions I 

1426
00:58:30,460 --> 00:58:31,990
have here,
which is a testament to you,

1427
00:58:31,991 --> 00:58:33,550
so I'm glad we've got to sit down.

1428
00:58:33,550 --> 00:58:34,383
So let me end this thing and a little 
bit of the future where you think this 

1429
00:58:39,281 --> 00:58:41,560
country is going in the next year.
Do you.

1430
00:58:41,640 --> 00:58:43,570
So I sent.
Are you supporting trump?

1431
00:58:44,180 --> 00:58:45,850
I haven't taken a position on anybody 
yet,

1432
00:58:46,600 --> 00:58:51,010
so I will support whoever the nominee is
over Hillary Clinton or Bernie Sanders.

1433
00:58:51,011 --> 00:58:51,970
Certainly,
yeah.

1434
00:58:52,030 --> 00:58:52,863
Do you view he'll,
hillary and Bernie both sort of as 

1435
00:58:54,611 --> 00:58:55,800
equally,
uh,

1436
00:58:56,020 --> 00:58:57,790
equally equally as equally bad?
I mean,

1437
00:58:57,791 --> 00:58:58,450
I mean,
when you've,

1438
00:58:58,450 --> 00:59:00,550
when you've asked Hillary to give the 
difference,

1439
00:59:00,551 --> 00:59:03,190
as Chris Matthews recently did,
between a Democrat and a socialist,

1440
00:59:03,280 --> 00:59:05,250
she couldn't do it.
Debbie Wasserman Schultz,

1441
00:59:05,260 --> 00:59:07,180
the chairwoman of the DNC,
was asked the same question,

1442
00:59:07,300 --> 00:59:08,700
she couldn't do it,
uh,

1443
00:59:08,740 --> 00:59:09,573
and Hillary has gone further to the left
because she's threatened by Bernie 

1444
00:59:11,800 --> 00:59:12,633
Sanders.
She's now come out by talking about a 

1445
00:59:13,601 --> 00:59:15,400
surcharge tax on,
on,

1446
00:59:15,401 --> 00:59:17,980
on millionaire.
She didn't do that before and she's also

1447
00:59:17,981 --> 00:59:19,450
coming out on the left now on gun.

1448
00:59:19,450 --> 00:59:21,950
She didn't want to do that before.
So Bernie's pushed her to the left.

1449
00:59:22,100 --> 00:59:22,933
So as far as I'm concerned,
their positions are pretty much 

1450
00:59:24,051 --> 00:59:25,290
indistinguishable.
Yeah.

1451
00:59:25,310 --> 00:59:26,143
And again,
this may go to show why the system is 

1452
00:59:27,561 --> 00:59:28,394
just broken because both sides in the 
primary process have to stake out these 

1453
00:59:31,491 --> 00:59:34,300
positions that they know that they're 
not going to govern by.

1454
00:59:34,340 --> 00:59:38,330
Richard Nixon used to say when you want 
to win a presidency and the primary,

1455
00:59:38,331 --> 00:59:40,610
you run to the right and then when you 
run into the general election,

1456
00:59:40,611 --> 00:59:42,650
you run to the center.
That's kind of how it works.

1457
00:59:42,770 --> 00:59:45,920
And the primary season you have to run 
to your base and then kind of run to the

1458
00:59:45,921 --> 00:59:47,660
standard different.
Trying to get independence.

1459
00:59:47,700 --> 00:59:48,770
That's just how it works.
Yeah.

1460
00:59:48,771 --> 00:59:49,491
All right,
well listen,

1461
00:59:49,491 --> 00:59:50,324
I've thoroughly enjoyed talking to you.
I didn't expect we were going to agree 

1462
00:59:52,041 --> 00:59:52,430
on everything.

1463
00:59:52,430 --> 00:59:53,690
We didn't.
That's fine.

1464
00:59:53,691 --> 00:59:56,280
Maybe I learned a little something here.
Maybe you learned a little bit.

1465
00:59:56,450 --> 00:59:57,600
Maybe you learned a little something 
going on.

1466
00:59:57,630 --> 00:59:58,463
So I see a glimmer in your eye.
So if you move a little bit towards the 

1467
00:59:59,841 --> 01:00:00,674
center.
Well I consider my has a classical 

1468
01:00:02,601 --> 01:00:03,500
liberal.
I don't,

1469
01:00:03,620 --> 01:00:07,550
I don't consider myself off the deep end
left and maybe I just,

1470
01:00:07,580 --> 01:00:08,413
I think in general a lot of people on 
the left are starting to realize how do 

1471
01:00:11,001 --> 01:00:13,260
you feel about vouchers?
Uh,

1472
01:00:13,430 --> 01:00:15,810
I think we should have vouchers.
I think you should have access to God.

1473
01:00:16,310 --> 01:00:17,300
How do you feel about affirmative 
action?

1474
01:00:17,301 --> 01:00:19,670
How do you feel about giving a black 
person or a brown person?

1475
01:00:19,671 --> 01:00:20,504
Additional points just because they're 
black and brown over some equally 

1476
01:00:22,971 --> 01:00:24,530
qualified white person.
Are you happy with that?

1477
01:00:24,560 --> 01:00:25,670
Unhappy.
Don't care.

1478
01:00:25,730 --> 01:00:27,020
Oh Man.
Now I'm being interviewed.

1479
01:00:27,040 --> 01:00:27,980
All right.
So yeah,

1480
01:00:27,981 --> 01:00:28,814
I would say that I think at some time,
at some point in America there was a 

1481
01:00:32,391 --> 01:00:33,224
reason that it really did make sense 
because because some of the more 

1482
01:00:35,811 --> 01:00:36,644
systemic stuff still exists today and 
today it probably doesn't make as much 

1483
01:00:41,150 --> 01:00:41,983
sense anymore.
I think you would agree with me on that 

1484
01:00:43,941 --> 01:00:45,700
because that's pretty much what you just
don't think it ever made anything,

1485
01:00:46,010 --> 01:00:49,460
but that's exactly why I want to have 
these conversations and why especially I

1486
01:00:49,461 --> 01:00:50,294
think that that liberals and 
Libertarians should realize that we're 

1487
01:00:53,421 --> 01:00:56,300
sort of in the center together and that 
there's a way to,

1488
01:00:56,480 --> 01:00:57,313
there's a way to work together.
So that's exactly why I wanted to do 

1489
01:00:59,451 --> 01:01:00,080
that.
Fair enough.

1490
01:01:00,080 --> 01:01:00,950
So,
all right,

1491
01:01:00,951 --> 01:01:03,440
so I thank my guest,
Larry Elder.

1492
01:01:03,570 --> 01:01:04,403
Uh,

1493
