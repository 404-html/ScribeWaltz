1
00:00:04,610 --> 00:00:09,610
Joining me today as a professor of 
English at the University of Ottawa and 

2
00:00:09,610 --> 00:00:13,301
author,
a self declared anti feminist and a 

3
00:00:13,301 --> 00:00:14,770
campaigner for the right to dissent.
Janice,

4
00:00:14,780 --> 00:00:16,100
be mango.
Welcome to the Rubin report.

5
00:00:16,270 --> 00:00:17,570
I want to thank you very much,
Dave.

6
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:22,840
It's nice to have you here.
We were looped in by this Jordan 

7
00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:25,070
Peterson Fella.
Apparently everyone knows this guy now.

8
00:00:26,660 --> 00:00:31,660
So before we do anything else,
I thought it would be interesting since 

9
00:00:31,660 --> 00:00:34,961
he looped us in together.
What do you make of the Jordan Peterson 

10
00:00:34,961 --> 00:00:34,961
phenomenon?

11
00:00:35,630 --> 00:00:36,650
Well,
um,

12
00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:38,450
uh,
to say the very least,

13
00:00:38,451 --> 00:00:43,451
I think what Jordan proves is that there
is an incredible hunger out there 

14
00:00:44,420 --> 00:00:48,050
amongst young people maybe amongst young
men in particular,

15
00:00:48,051 --> 00:00:51,590
but um,
obviously amongst women as well for,

16
00:00:51,980 --> 00:00:53,270
um,
for,

17
00:00:53,540 --> 00:00:58,540
for something that's really genuine and 
hard hitting and real in terms of 

18
00:00:59,361 --> 00:01:03,260
discussing what matters in the world 
today.

19
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:08,480
Uh,
something that we aren't getting in our 

20
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:08,900
public conversations at all.
And uh,

21
00:01:08,901 --> 00:01:13,901
and Jordan obviously offers that and uh,
and all of the attempts to discredit him

22
00:01:15,411 --> 00:01:20,120
and to claim that he represents 
something really dark and nefarious.

23
00:01:20,170 --> 00:01:22,460
Um,
it clearly isn't working.

24
00:01:22,461 --> 00:01:25,690
And turning people off.
It ain't going to stop though.

25
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:26,780
No,
no,

26
00:01:26,930 --> 00:01:28,730
no.
It's just ramping up,

27
00:01:28,731 --> 00:01:29,270
I think.

28
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:30,180
Yeah.
Yeah.

29
00:01:30,210 --> 00:01:35,210
What is going on in Canada that there 
seems to be a burst of Canadian 

30
00:01:36,061 --> 00:01:39,540
professors from,
from Jordan to you and God says,

31
00:01:39,810 --> 00:01:41,760
and plenty of others,
uh,

32
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:44,340
feel free to name drop some others that 
should be on my radar.

33
00:01:44,610 --> 00:01:49,020
There seems to be a real pushback from 
Canadian professors,

34
00:01:49,021 --> 00:01:53,850
at least a small select group of them 
against this sort of group think and pro

35
00:01:53,860 --> 00:01:57,090
photo diversity and whatever you want to
call this whole move.

36
00:01:57,660 --> 00:01:58,650
Yeah.
Well,

37
00:01:58,651 --> 00:02:03,651
I'm actually,
I think it's unfortunately still a 

38
00:02:03,651 --> 00:02:04,050
relatively small group.
I would say.

39
00:02:04,051 --> 00:02:06,410
I think there needs to be a lot more in 
the way of pushback.

40
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:11,540
The thing that really struck me about 
Jordan Peterson situation when he first 

41
00:02:11,581 --> 00:02:15,330
sort of burst onto the scene with his 
declaration that he would not,

42
00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:16,730
um,
you know,

43
00:02:16,740 --> 00:02:19,650
he,
he would not engage in forced to speech,

44
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:21,630
um,
that,

45
00:02:21,660 --> 00:02:26,660
that not a single professor at the 
University of Toronto would come forward

46
00:02:27,150 --> 00:02:32,150
even to say.
I may not necessarily agree with what 

47
00:02:32,150 --> 00:02:33,930
he's saying,
but I support his right to say it,

48
00:02:34,170 --> 00:02:36,270
and that's one of the largest 
universities,

49
00:02:36,271 --> 00:02:40,410
if not the largest university in Canada 
and probably the most prestigious one.

50
00:02:40,740 --> 00:02:45,740
And the fact that not a single professor
felt that he or she could stand with 

51
00:02:46,381 --> 00:02:50,460
Jordan in that moment.
That was astounding to me.

52
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:52,290
And so,
um,

53
00:02:52,380 --> 00:02:53,400
yeah,
there are a few.

54
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:58,350
And Gad sad is a wonderful example.
I have a close friend at,

55
00:02:58,351 --> 00:03:03,351
um,
acadia university who was actually just 

56
00:03:03,351 --> 00:03:03,760
fired this year,
Rick Mehta,

57
00:03:04,390 --> 00:03:06,730
who was inspired by Jordan,
he,

58
00:03:06,770 --> 00:03:11,770
he was someone who had been thinking for
years a lot of the things that Jordan 

59
00:03:11,770 --> 00:03:14,020
has talked about in terms of the group 
think in academia,

60
00:03:14,030 --> 00:03:17,650
the whole range of subjects that you can
even talk about,

61
00:03:18,020 --> 00:03:20,560
well,
that you can't talk about from a variety

62
00:03:20,561 --> 00:03:24,730
of positions that you have to take one 
position on a.

63
00:03:24,730 --> 00:03:26,800
and so he finally started speaking out.
Before this,

64
00:03:26,801 --> 00:03:31,570
he was an award winning teacher and the 
year he started speaking out,

65
00:03:31,571 --> 00:03:35,320
he had so many complaints and he's now 
actually been fired.

66
00:03:35,321 --> 00:03:38,140
A tenured professor.
This is an astounding thing.

67
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:39,490
So,
um,

68
00:03:39,940 --> 00:03:43,270
so unfortunately I would say that what's
happening in Canada is that a few people

69
00:03:43,271 --> 00:03:46,510
are speaking out and a lot of people are
speaking privately,

70
00:03:46,550 --> 00:03:47,560
I'm saying,
you know,

71
00:03:47,561 --> 00:03:52,180
I really support what you're talking 
about and I really wish I could do it as

72
00:03:52,181 --> 00:03:57,181
well,
but it's way too dangerous for me to do 

73
00:03:57,181 --> 00:04:00,211
so.
And the case of Professor Mehta at 

74
00:04:00,211 --> 00:04:03,350
Acadia proves that indeed people have 
reason to be very fearful.

75
00:04:03,830 --> 00:04:04,390
Yeah.
You know,

76
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:09,400
in the case of Professor Metta,
it's so interesting to me that one of 

77
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:12,341
the ways I get guests is that suddenly 
someone does something often at a 

78
00:04:12,341 --> 00:04:14,330
university and then it starts bubbling 
and there's some stories,

79
00:04:14,331 --> 00:04:19,331
right?
And then I started hearing about it on 

80
00:04:19,331 --> 00:04:21,191
twitter and then it bubbles up enough 
and then they usually end up right in 

81
00:04:21,191 --> 00:04:24,821
that seat where you are right there.
And I suspect he'll probably be adhere 

82
00:04:24,821 --> 00:04:24,821
to.
And in a weird way,

83
00:04:24,821 --> 00:04:29,501
all of you guys are just defending the 
ability to think about these issues.

84
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:36,040
The positions that most of you are 
taking off and wouldn't have been 

85
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:36,040
considered radical 20 years.

86
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:37,200
Absolutely not,
no,

87
00:04:37,260 --> 00:04:38,130
no,
they wouldn't have been.

88
00:04:38,150 --> 00:04:39,650
In fact,
I mean in,

89
00:04:39,670 --> 00:04:44,670
in Professor Metta is case.
It seems to me he's such an excellent 

90
00:04:44,670 --> 00:04:48,730
example of the fact that this is not 
about even an,

91
00:04:48,731 --> 00:04:51,960
an individual saying offensive things 
because

92
00:04:52,070 --> 00:04:53,690
what were the supposedly defensive

93
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:54,660
totally.
I mean,

94
00:04:55,290 --> 00:04:57,930
and he didn't take these as positions,
you know,

95
00:04:57,931 --> 00:04:58,740
he,
he,

96
00:04:58,741 --> 00:05:03,741
I think would,
would identify himself as a classic 

97
00:05:03,741 --> 00:05:06,360
liberal.
He's not particularly conservative,

98
00:05:06,660 --> 00:05:11,660
but he,
he wanted to talk about the full range 

99
00:05:11,660 --> 00:05:14,730
of issues he objected to his 
universities indigenization program,

100
00:05:14,731 --> 00:05:19,290
which I think maybe was the most 
controversial of the subjects.

101
00:05:19,291 --> 00:05:23,490
And this is,
I think this is probably now the top hot

102
00:05:23,491 --> 00:05:26,910
button issue at Canadian universities.
Um,

103
00:05:26,911 --> 00:05:29,070
it's the,
um,

104
00:05:29,340 --> 00:05:34,340
the move to replace European based 
knowledge as exclusionary and inadequate

105
00:05:36,511 --> 00:05:41,511
and subjective and to replace it in some
cases with indigenous knowledge.

106
00:05:42,510 --> 00:05:47,510
Uh,
and even in something called indigenous 

107
00:05:47,510 --> 00:05:50,271
science,
which many scientists would say is 

108
00:05:50,271 --> 00:05:53,541
actually not.
I mean there is only there science that 

109
00:05:53,541 --> 00:05:53,820
is all there is.
Um,

110
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:56,730
and so indigenous science has to do 
with,

111
00:05:57,050 --> 00:06:02,050
um,
indigenous ways of knowing elders' 

112
00:06:02,050 --> 00:06:05,621
knowledge.
What some might say is superstition or 

113
00:06:05,621 --> 00:06:09,761
magical beliefs,
sort of anecdotal kinds of observations 

114
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:14,920
and you know,
there is an attempt on the part of 

115
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:17,381
universities in some ways a lot of one 
to bring in indigenous peoples who've 

116
00:06:17,381 --> 00:06:21,720
been excluded from the university 
experience for many years for a variety 

117
00:06:21,981 --> 00:06:22,640
of reasons.

118
00:06:23,030 --> 00:06:24,200
But,
um,

119
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:29,500
the idea that indigenous knowledge is 
not to be questioned that it has a value

120
00:06:31,850 --> 00:06:36,850
equal to supposedly European science is 
a really incredibly worrisome and 

121
00:06:37,971 --> 00:06:42,380
strange idea.
And so he objected to that and he raised

122
00:06:42,381 --> 00:06:45,650
a whole bunch of other questions,
not even saying that he wanted to,

123
00:06:45,860 --> 00:06:48,380
that he was necessarily taking a 
position on them,

124
00:06:48,381 --> 00:06:49,610
but merely saying that,
you know,

125
00:06:49,611 --> 00:06:54,611
he,
he said that identity politics is 

126
00:06:54,611 --> 00:06:56,330
divisive and causes resentment.
Who would've thought,

127
00:06:56,530 --> 00:06:58,950
believe it?
I never heard that before.

128
00:06:59,000 --> 00:06:59,570
Yeah,
he,

129
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:01,160
he talked about,
um,

130
00:07:01,190 --> 00:07:01,800
you know,
the,

131
00:07:01,801 --> 00:07:06,801
the,
the psychological science about 

132
00:07:06,801 --> 00:07:09,191
differences in,
in preference and interest and 

133
00:07:09,191 --> 00:07:10,820
intellectual ability between men and 
women.

134
00:07:11,140 --> 00:07:12,260
Um,
he,

135
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:18,520
what else did he talked about the wage 
gap and said that there was a lot of 

136
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:23,150
evidence to suggest that it was based on
preferences and choices that people made

137
00:07:23,151 --> 00:07:25,830
rather than bias against women and their
whole bunch of.

138
00:07:25,830 --> 00:07:30,830
And he really was just trying to do what
exactly as you said professors once 

139
00:07:30,981 --> 00:07:35,110
we're supposed to do and that's now no 
longer possible in,

140
00:07:35,140 --> 00:07:40,140
in the university classroom.
And I think a lot of students probably 

141
00:07:40,140 --> 00:07:44,020
liked him.
I mean he got these teaching awards and 

142
00:07:44,020 --> 00:07:45,290
he had a lot of support even up until 
the point that he was fired.

143
00:07:45,291 --> 00:07:50,291
But because I,
a condray of very angry students and 

144
00:07:51,351 --> 00:07:56,351
also very angry colleagues and it is 
often professors who are persecuting 

145
00:07:56,351 --> 00:08:01,091
other professors.
They claimed the complained about him 

146
00:08:01,091 --> 00:08:02,240
and said that he was harassing them.

147
00:08:02,610 --> 00:08:07,610
So let's put the student part aside for 
a second because we're going to get to 

148
00:08:07,610 --> 00:08:07,610
that a little bit,
but the colleague,

149
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:11,370
the fact that so much of this is being 
driven by other professors.

150
00:08:11,371 --> 00:08:14,040
I mean we saw this with Bret Weinstein 
at evergreen state.

151
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:18,660
Jordan and many of my other friends who 
are professors now tell me,

152
00:08:18,810 --> 00:08:22,710
they often get support privately from 
professors but not publicly,

153
00:08:22,711 --> 00:08:25,470
which is the most enraging God tells me 
about this all the time.

154
00:08:25,860 --> 00:08:28,500
But what do you make of professors that 
are,

155
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:32,850
that are leading this charge against 
inquiry?

156
00:08:34,410 --> 00:08:36,390
Well,
they're true believers.

157
00:08:36,450 --> 00:08:38,520
I think many of them and,
well,

158
00:08:38,910 --> 00:08:41,190
some are true believers.
They,

159
00:08:41,191 --> 00:08:42,120
they,
um,

160
00:08:42,150 --> 00:08:46,800
they see themselves as part of a 
revolution that's absolutely necessary.

161
00:08:46,801 --> 00:08:51,801
They believe that our society is one of 
entrenched inequality and structural 

162
00:08:53,881 --> 00:08:57,570
violence against,
against racial minorities,

163
00:08:57,571 --> 00:09:00,630
against indigenous peoples,
against trans people.

164
00:09:00,650 --> 00:09:02,070
And you know,
the,

165
00:09:02,071 --> 00:09:03,090
all the,
the uh,

166
00:09:03,570 --> 00:09:05,100
uh,
the claims and uh,

167
00:09:05,101 --> 00:09:10,101
and so they,
they see that any attempt to argue or 

168
00:09:10,101 --> 00:09:14,901
against their positions or to simply 
call for more open discussion is a way 

169
00:09:15,391 --> 00:09:19,080
of reasserting of very unjust.
They would say,

170
00:09:19,130 --> 00:09:21,390
you know,
deathly status quo.

171
00:09:21,570 --> 00:09:26,570
And then a lot of people I think are not
true believers but are just going along 

172
00:09:26,570 --> 00:09:28,530
for career reasons or because it's 
easier to go along.

173
00:09:28,531 --> 00:09:33,510
They just want to do their research and 
they can only do it in peace if they say

174
00:09:33,511 --> 00:09:35,400
all the correct,
you know,

175
00:09:36,180 --> 00:09:36,990
platitudes.

176
00:09:37,330 --> 00:09:38,680
Um,
so I mean,

177
00:09:38,740 --> 00:09:41,970
what happened was that I think 
gradually,

178
00:09:42,180 --> 00:09:46,120
um,
the idea of the university was destroyed

179
00:09:46,121 --> 00:09:48,240
it whenever it started,
how it happened.

180
00:09:48,241 --> 00:09:53,241
I mean,
it seems to have started sometimes in 

181
00:09:53,241 --> 00:09:53,241
the late sixties.
Allan Bloom,

182
00:09:53,241 --> 00:09:54,300
I'm sure you've read the closing of the 
American mind,

183
00:09:54,301 --> 00:09:54,780
you know,
he,

184
00:09:54,781 --> 00:09:59,781
he,
his claim is that professors lost faith 

185
00:09:59,781 --> 00:10:04,670
in the idea of the university as a sort 
of separate space where you simply 

186
00:10:05,101 --> 00:10:08,040
thought about things you didn't get 
involved.

187
00:10:08,041 --> 00:10:09,180
And I,
he has a wonderful line.

188
00:10:09,181 --> 00:10:14,130
I remember something about how socrates 
felt that it was more important to think

189
00:10:14,131 --> 00:10:19,131
about justice and to,
to really learn what justice is rather 

190
00:10:19,131 --> 00:10:22,220
than try to implement whatever partial 
version of it,

191
00:10:22,230 --> 00:10:27,230
you know,
as roiling the public consciousness of 

192
00:10:27,230 --> 00:10:27,230
the day.
And um,

193
00:10:27,230 --> 00:10:30,990
and so that was what the university had 
meant at its best,

194
00:10:30,991 --> 00:10:31,440
I think.

195
00:10:31,990 --> 00:10:36,990
And this is a case of where the 
university original mission of being a 

196
00:10:37,961 --> 00:10:42,961
place to find truth and giving people 
the opportunity to think about these 

197
00:10:42,961 --> 00:10:42,961
issues,
debate these issues,

198
00:10:42,961 --> 00:10:47,341
etc.
Has taken a complete one 80 because now 

199
00:10:47,341 --> 00:10:48,790
it seems to be the breeding ground for 
the opposite of those ideas.

200
00:10:48,820 --> 00:10:50,740
It is a breeding ground for sure.
I mean,

201
00:10:50,741 --> 00:10:51,730
it's,
it's wHere,

202
00:10:51,731 --> 00:10:55,360
um,
all of the indoctrination takes place.

203
00:10:55,361 --> 00:11:00,361
And then of course the students who are 
indoctrinated go out into all the major 

204
00:11:01,690 --> 00:11:03,490
spheres of our society.
They,

205
00:11:03,510 --> 00:11:06,070
they,
they go to law school where they,

206
00:11:06,130 --> 00:11:09,820
they read critical legal theory that 
tells them that they're there is,

207
00:11:10,210 --> 00:11:15,210
there's nothing unbiased or objective 
about the legal system that we have in 

208
00:11:15,671 --> 00:11:18,340
north America that it needs to be 
completely remade.

209
00:11:18,790 --> 00:11:19,870
Um,
they,

210
00:11:19,930 --> 00:11:24,930
they become journalists and they go to 
journalism school where they learn the 

211
00:11:24,930 --> 00:11:29,491
same thing and they're told that a 
journalist should be somebody who 

212
00:11:29,491 --> 00:11:32,611
attempts to improve and change society,
make it better rather than just report 

213
00:11:33,930 --> 00:11:34,560
the,
you know,

214
00:11:34,561 --> 00:11:35,710
what's,
what's happening.

215
00:11:35,890 --> 00:11:37,420
They become teachers,
they,

216
00:11:37,450 --> 00:11:41,710
they go into the education faculties 
where they're also being radicalized and

217
00:11:41,740 --> 00:11:46,740
you know,
and so it's not surprising that this is 

218
00:11:46,740 --> 00:11:46,740
where we're at now.

219
00:11:46,740 --> 00:11:48,110
One of the things that fascinates me 
about this,

220
00:11:48,111 --> 00:11:53,111
every time I hear another professor come
in and talk about it or I just see 

221
00:11:53,111 --> 00:11:56,111
another breaking story about it or 
another monument taken down or whatever 

222
00:11:56,111 --> 00:11:56,650
it is,
the ratio of history,

223
00:11:57,460 --> 00:12:01,090
is that what you said before about the,
the indigenous sciences.

224
00:12:01,091 --> 00:12:03,130
It's like they don't want you to just 
say,

225
00:12:03,131 --> 00:12:08,131
okay,
maybe we can have an extra course in 

226
00:12:08,131 --> 00:12:10,610
this and teach it hopefully with the 
same academic rigor as you would teach a

227
00:12:10,690 --> 00:12:13,180
european scientists or what's known as 
you said,

228
00:12:13,181 --> 00:12:15,220
as science.
We could have a,

229
00:12:15,221 --> 00:12:18,130
a parallel course if you want to take 
that as well,

230
00:12:18,340 --> 00:12:21,130
but they actually,
they want to replace history in that.

231
00:12:21,131 --> 00:12:23,770
That seems to me to be the most 
dangerous part of this.

232
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:24,790
Yeah,
yeah.

233
00:12:24,830 --> 00:12:29,830
Well and it.
But it's not surprising if you believe 

234
00:12:29,830 --> 00:12:32,060
that the system that we have now is,
you know,

235
00:12:32,061 --> 00:12:33,800
kills people.
It's always.

236
00:12:33,801 --> 00:12:35,750
The rhetoric is really,
really extreme.

237
00:12:35,751 --> 00:12:36,200
It's like,
you know,

238
00:12:36,201 --> 00:12:40,340
what you're saying is,
is violence to me and my family,

239
00:12:40,580 --> 00:12:41,660
what you're saying,
you know,

240
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:46,720
causes people to die.
So if you really believe that in some 

241
00:12:47,001 --> 00:12:49,280
way,
then you can't just bring in,

242
00:12:49,281 --> 00:12:51,950
you can't just have add ons of other 
courses.

243
00:12:52,330 --> 00:12:54,790
It is a,
this is not a referral for the witches.

244
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:56,120
Yeah,
absolutely.

245
00:12:56,210 --> 00:13:01,210
It's this and it's not a reform movement
even where you could get to a point 

246
00:13:01,210 --> 00:13:01,400
where you would say,
okay,

247
00:13:01,401 --> 00:13:02,370
we've made,
you know,

248
00:13:02,390 --> 00:13:07,390
certain structural changes to satisfy 
these various concerns.

249
00:13:07,971 --> 00:13:11,600
It is a radical revolutionary movement 
that,

250
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:15,320
you know,
everything has to be smashed and rebuilt

251
00:13:15,650 --> 00:13:17,210
and,
and yeah.

252
00:13:17,211 --> 00:13:18,740
And,
and I think um,

253
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:24,160
there's a,
a very naive confidence on the part of 

254
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:27,850
many professors that,
that they know better than generations 

255
00:13:29,091 --> 00:13:34,091
and generations of people who came 
before and then they will be able to 

256
00:13:34,091 --> 00:13:34,880
build jerusalem.

257
00:13:35,550 --> 00:13:38,570
I somehow somehow doubted.
all right.

258
00:13:38,790 --> 00:13:40,530
But,
so let's back up a little bit and again,

259
00:13:40,550 --> 00:13:45,010
get to your involvement at all of this.
So a self declared antI feminists,

260
00:13:45,020 --> 00:13:48,000
the defender of descent.
I'm a big fan of descent.

261
00:13:48,300 --> 00:13:53,300
So just tell me a little bit about your 
academic background and what sort of 

262
00:13:53,300 --> 00:13:54,930
brought you to believe some of the 
things that you believe now.

263
00:13:55,050 --> 00:13:56,040
Yeah.
Um,

264
00:13:56,041 --> 00:13:57,680
well,
you know,

265
00:13:57,690 --> 00:14:02,690
I started off as I think a pretty well 
to go back further.

266
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,070
I started off as a,
as just a,

267
00:14:05,090 --> 00:14:06,720
you know,
someone who loved literature.

268
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:11,880
I was a nerd.
I love to read and that was all I know 

269
00:14:11,970 --> 00:14:15,180
from the time I was very young.
I wanted to be a university professor.

270
00:14:15,181 --> 00:14:20,181
I want to teach literature.
So then I got into graduate school and I

271
00:14:20,851 --> 00:14:23,670
was radicalized there,
I would say,

272
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:25,120
um,
like everyone,

273
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:25,640
you know,
and,

274
00:14:25,670 --> 00:14:26,510
and,
um,

275
00:14:26,580 --> 00:14:29,880
and,
and that experience was really important

276
00:14:29,881 --> 00:14:34,881
to me and that I realized how incredibly
pleasurable it is to be a radical.

277
00:14:36,350 --> 00:14:41,350
Describe that a little bit,
that feeling because it's,

278
00:14:41,581 --> 00:14:42,250
you know,
it's a,

279
00:14:42,251 --> 00:14:45,900
it's a very addictive and maybe it is 
even a kind of addiction.

280
00:14:45,901 --> 00:14:50,901
I'm sure that there are all sorts of 
chemical changes that go on in your 

281
00:14:50,901 --> 00:14:51,710
brain when you're feeling this.

282
00:14:51,710 --> 00:14:56,710
It's a combination of sort of euphoric 
rage and I'm self righteous indignation 

283
00:15:00,111 --> 00:15:02,360
and um,
and,

284
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:03,520
and,
and uh,

285
00:15:03,530 --> 00:15:05,990
yeah,
righteous outrage and uh,

286
00:15:05,991 --> 00:15:06,580
so yeah,
I,

287
00:15:06,581 --> 00:15:07,670
you know,
I did all the things.

288
00:15:07,770 --> 00:15:11,390
I marched in,
take back the night marches and I worked

289
00:15:11,391 --> 00:15:16,391
at a women's shelter and um,
and then suddenly then I started to see 

290
00:15:16,391 --> 00:15:20,381
that my purpose in a becoming a 
university professor would be to 

291
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:26,500
radicalize other students and to show 
them what I had come to understand.

292
00:15:27,290 --> 00:15:28,490
And um,
yeah,

293
00:15:28,491 --> 00:15:29,960
and it's,
it's a,

294
00:15:29,961 --> 00:15:34,961
it's a very heady experience and I've 
thought for years and years like when I 

295
00:15:34,961 --> 00:15:38,750
came off it because I think partly 
because of my background,

296
00:15:38,751 --> 00:15:40,360
my parents,
um,

297
00:15:40,980 --> 00:15:44,390
are lower middle class and my dad died 
last year.

298
00:15:44,391 --> 00:15:45,330
But,
um,

299
00:15:46,340 --> 00:15:49,520
somehow the,
that outrage,

300
00:15:49,521 --> 00:15:54,521
it just didn't fit with the values that 
they'd given me and it,

301
00:15:55,950 --> 00:15:56,600
it,
it,

302
00:15:56,660 --> 00:15:59,930
I couldn't hold on to the,
the conviction.

303
00:16:00,020 --> 00:16:05,020
How long did it last for you?
it lasted while I was a graduate 

304
00:16:05,020 --> 00:16:05,020
student.
Really?

305
00:16:05,020 --> 00:16:08,681
So like from about 1991 to 94 or 
something around there.

306
00:16:08,751 --> 00:16:10,900
And then it started to fade off because 
I just started.

307
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:13,970
Do you remember moments?
Was there a seminal moment?

308
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,040
There wasn't one moment,
I wouldn't say,

309
00:16:16,041 --> 00:16:17,360
but there,
there were just,

310
00:16:17,390 --> 00:16:21,800
there were a number of moments where I,
I just,

311
00:16:22,220 --> 00:16:25,700
I couldn't hold on to the sense of 
conviction.

312
00:16:25,701 --> 00:16:28,520
I,
I can't think of a specific moment until

313
00:16:28,970 --> 00:16:33,970
I'm like,
by the time I started teaching full 

314
00:16:33,970 --> 00:16:34,700
time,
I started teaching full time in 1999.

315
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:38,720
And at that point I would've said that I
was,

316
00:16:38,780 --> 00:16:43,780
um,
I probably would've said I was still a 

317
00:16:43,780 --> 00:16:43,780
feminist,
but I,

318
00:16:43,780 --> 00:16:45,500
I would have seen myself as more of a 
moderate feminist and,

319
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:48,050
and um,
and I wouldn't,

320
00:16:48,140 --> 00:16:51,980
that wouldn't have been my primary self 
identification.

321
00:16:51,980 --> 00:16:54,920
I would have said I was an animal lover 
or something else like that.

322
00:16:56,060 --> 00:16:58,880
And then,
but nine slash 11 was really my,

323
00:16:58,940 --> 00:17:03,940
that was my moment.
And it was because at the university 

324
00:17:03,940 --> 00:17:06,710
that I was teaching at at the time,
university of saskatchewan,

325
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:09,590
I'll never forget that morning,
um,

326
00:17:09,591 --> 00:17:14,591
I was already at work.
The secretary said that know planes had 

327
00:17:14,591 --> 00:17:18,671
flown into the towers and I was 
horrified.

328
00:17:18,740 --> 00:17:20,020
And,
and,

329
00:17:20,090 --> 00:17:25,090
but I noticed that the mood at the 
university and in my department in 

330
00:17:25,761 --> 00:17:30,410
particular,
it was one of like barely contained sort

331
00:17:30,411 --> 00:17:35,411
of haunting pleasure.
I couldn't believe it.

332
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:37,850
And,
or at least,

333
00:17:37,851 --> 00:17:42,230
I mean maybe that's maybe not everybody 
felt that that could have been just my,

334
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:44,120
um,
my sense of it,

335
00:17:44,121 --> 00:17:49,121
but certainly a kind of satisfaction.
And in fact one of my friends came into 

336
00:17:49,801 --> 00:17:51,330
the mail room and said,
well,

337
00:17:51,331 --> 00:17:53,130
they've got what they deserved.

338
00:17:53,310 --> 00:17:54,150
This is like,
you know,

339
00:17:54,151 --> 00:17:58,650
within an hour of the news.
Another said that she was going to teach

340
00:17:58,651 --> 00:18:02,370
about it that day.
And this was like really early on in the

341
00:18:02,371 --> 00:18:04,620
term.
So she hadn't even really started.

342
00:18:04,650 --> 00:18:09,650
I think this was be like our first week 
or maybe the first part of the second 

343
00:18:10,711 --> 00:18:11,370
week.
But anyway.

344
00:18:11,371 --> 00:18:16,371
And she was going to teach about the 
event and she was going to talk about 

345
00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:20,400
how,
how this would be used by reaction,

346
00:18:20,430 --> 00:18:24,450
how this would likely be used by 
reactionary forces in the United States.

347
00:18:24,451 --> 00:18:29,451
And how it would be very interesting to 
watch over the next few days who they 

348
00:18:29,451 --> 00:18:30,980
would blame and how they would begin to 
manipulate.

349
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:31,910
I thought,
wow.

350
00:18:31,950 --> 00:18:33,210
Like it hasn't.
I mean,

351
00:18:33,570 --> 00:18:34,830
you know,
it,

352
00:18:34,980 --> 00:18:39,980
she never even thought that maybe 
there'll be students in the class who 

353
00:18:39,980 --> 00:18:40,560
would be really upset.
I might even,

354
00:18:40,561 --> 00:18:45,561
you know,
somebody who knew somebody or it was 

355
00:18:45,561 --> 00:18:48,561
just the,
the lack of human empathy and the,

356
00:18:49,020 --> 00:18:51,360
the hatred,
the satisfied hatred.

357
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:55,440
That was really my moment that turned me
off completely.

358
00:18:55,850 --> 00:18:57,390
Um,
from the,

359
00:18:57,450 --> 00:18:59,400
everything to do with the,
the left,

360
00:18:59,401 --> 00:19:02,690
the progressivism,
the anti american ism,

361
00:19:02,730 --> 00:19:05,520
the anti western culture,
everything.

362
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:08,310
Then the other thing that was happening 
at the same time,

363
00:19:08,390 --> 00:19:12,180
um,
role in the year before too,

364
00:19:12,750 --> 00:19:13,690
was that,
um,

365
00:19:13,830 --> 00:19:18,830
my department was doing a fair bit of 
hiring and we were doing what we called 

366
00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:25,050
equity hiring,
affirmative action hiring and um,

367
00:19:25,051 --> 00:19:30,051
we were very,
very keen to hire more women and to 

368
00:19:30,051 --> 00:19:30,200
hire,
um,

369
00:19:30,300 --> 00:19:34,230
members of visible minorities and 
indigenous people.

370
00:19:34,770 --> 00:19:36,840
And I,
I jusT,

371
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:37,530
you know,
and there,

372
00:19:37,540 --> 00:19:42,540
there was,
you weren't allowed to obviously object 

373
00:19:42,540 --> 00:19:43,080
in any way and nobody did.
Everyone,

374
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:46,350
a set,
maybe occasionally privately,

375
00:19:46,410 --> 00:19:47,910
a bit,
a bit of demoro,

376
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:51,030
but um,
but basically everyone was publicly very

377
00:19:51,031 --> 00:19:56,031
enthusiastic and it just struck me as 
the most unjust,

378
00:19:56,731 --> 00:20:01,110
ridiculous thing.
I'm basically like no men,

379
00:20:01,380 --> 00:20:06,380
no white men were,
were even considered for any of the 

380
00:20:06,380 --> 00:20:08,280
positions that were offered.

381
00:20:08,940 --> 00:20:10,770
And I,
I,

382
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:16,520
I couldn't see how that was a good thing
in any way at all.

383
00:20:17,251 --> 00:20:22,251
And it just,
it seemed to me outraging and the all 

384
00:20:22,251 --> 00:20:25,641
and you know,
we would get hundreds of applications 

385
00:20:25,641 --> 00:20:28,611
for some of the positions and all of 
these men who had done all these amazing

386
00:20:28,711 --> 00:20:33,711
things being just being put aside and 
women who had done far,

387
00:20:35,190 --> 00:20:40,190
far less being considered and brought in
for interview.

388
00:20:41,101 --> 00:20:43,290
And always the idea was that,
you know,

389
00:20:43,340 --> 00:20:48,340
this was equity hiring,
which meant that if two candidates were 

390
00:20:48,340 --> 00:20:52,201
equally qualified and you know,
we would choose the woman.

391
00:20:52,931 --> 00:20:57,931
But of course,
as soon as you're looking to hire for 

392
00:20:57,931 --> 00:21:01,440
political reason,
you're not considering the true 

393
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:02,320
qualities of the candidates at all.

394
00:21:02,430 --> 00:21:04,340
So in,
in a situation like this,

395
00:21:05,270 --> 00:21:10,270
if we,
if you had two candidates that had the 

396
00:21:10,270 --> 00:21:11,650
exact same criteria and you had a 
department that was,

397
00:21:11,651 --> 00:21:16,651
say 90 percent male in that case,
what would your position be?

398
00:21:17,090 --> 00:21:18,610
This.
I know what you're saying.

399
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:23,800
I never get to that place where it's 
exactly what the proposition a.

400
00:21:24,070 --> 00:21:24,690
Yeah,
no,

401
00:21:24,820 --> 00:21:29,820
there are.
There are never two candidates who are 

402
00:21:29,820 --> 00:21:31,951
exactly the same and I honestly could 
never see a situation where it would be 

403
00:21:31,951 --> 00:21:34,410
so urgent that you would hire on the 
basis of a,

404
00:21:34,420 --> 00:21:36,430
you know,
an identity category.

405
00:21:36,850 --> 00:21:40,000
And I can't believe that.
I mean,

406
00:21:40,001 --> 00:21:42,910
the arguments for,
um,

407
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:45,460
changing the,
you know,

408
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:49,780
the demographic mix of workplaces or 
whatever,

409
00:21:50,770 --> 00:21:55,390
I can see them applying in very narrow 
circumstances.

410
00:21:55,391 --> 00:21:58,300
For instance,
in primary school I would say yeah,

411
00:21:58,500 --> 00:22:03,500
it's probably a good idea that children 
have a mix of men and women and as 

412
00:22:05,561 --> 00:22:10,561
teachers and maybe even an ethnic mix if
it's an ethnically mixed school,

413
00:22:11,860 --> 00:22:15,940
I could see that as important.
And in fact,

414
00:22:15,941 --> 00:22:17,560
that doesn't happen because,
you know,

415
00:22:17,561 --> 00:22:18,610
most,
um,

416
00:22:18,670 --> 00:22:21,220
primary schools are taught almost 
entirely by,

417
00:22:21,310 --> 00:22:22,650
by women.
Uh,

418
00:22:22,660 --> 00:22:27,660
so little boys who might not have a dad 
at home are not even getting a chance to

419
00:22:29,141 --> 00:22:33,580
have a male role model,
male role model at primary school.

420
00:22:33,700 --> 00:22:38,080
So that would be a place where I could 
maybe see the case for it,

421
00:22:38,081 --> 00:22:42,800
but at a university I just,
I really can't see the necessity I do.

422
00:22:42,950 --> 00:22:47,950
I don't believe that any promising young
person is actually going to be turned 

423
00:22:50,351 --> 00:22:55,351
off a subject because they don't see 
somebody who looks exactly like them 

424
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:57,970
reflected in the professoriate.

425
00:22:58,210 --> 00:23:03,210
And if they do,
then what a deeply profound a 

426
00:23:03,210 --> 00:23:05,150
disturbance has already happened in the 
education system.

427
00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:05,370
Right?

428
00:23:05,460 --> 00:23:06,540
Yeah.
I mean I just,

429
00:23:06,630 --> 00:23:09,820
I mean,
I don't believe that our system is,

430
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:12,850
is so exclusionary and you know,
that,

431
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:15,480
I mean we hear this so much about how 
now,

432
00:23:15,481 --> 00:23:18,840
especially women in stem and also I 
guess um,

433
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:20,970
um,
racial minorities.

434
00:23:20,971 --> 00:23:23,130
but,
but I hear more about women need,

435
00:23:23,131 --> 00:23:23,650
you know,
they,

436
00:23:23,660 --> 00:23:28,660
they just can't go into astronomy 
because supposedly there aren't enough 

437
00:23:28,920 --> 00:23:33,920
female astronomers.
A friend of mine who actually left 

438
00:23:33,920 --> 00:23:38,600
Australia,
he was working as an astrophysicist in 

439
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:42,531
Australia.
He left there and went to China because 

440
00:23:42,531 --> 00:23:43,050
he realized that there was no future for
him at all.

441
00:23:43,051 --> 00:23:43,680
Like,
no,

442
00:23:43,710 --> 00:23:48,710
he couldn't possibly get a tenure track 
position because they were so set on 

443
00:23:48,710 --> 00:23:51,020
hiring women or other identity 
categories.

444
00:23:51,021 --> 00:23:54,080
And um,
he always sends me things.

445
00:23:54,081 --> 00:23:59,081
And recently he sent me something,
a phd student was being brought in to 

446
00:23:59,081 --> 00:24:00,620
talk to.
Um,

447
00:24:01,010 --> 00:24:02,900
I think his old department,
she said,

448
00:24:02,901 --> 00:24:04,820
I'm so glad I'm not there anymore.

449
00:24:05,080 --> 00:24:05,570
Uh,
and,

450
00:24:05,630 --> 00:24:08,810
and she was going to be talking about 
how,

451
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:09,650
uh,
you know,

452
00:24:09,651 --> 00:24:14,651
there are,
there are not enough women represented 

453
00:24:14,651 --> 00:24:16,910
in astronomy because even like the laws 
are named after,

454
00:24:16,911 --> 00:24:20,750
they're all named after men.
So there's like newton's law,

455
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:23,050
you know,
law.

456
00:24:23,500 --> 00:24:25,700
Yeah.
And that was the idea that some of these

457
00:24:25,701 --> 00:24:28,400
laws should actually be named after 
somebody else,

458
00:24:28,401 --> 00:24:30,890
even though they're named after the men 
because the men,

459
00:24:31,220 --> 00:24:34,760
obviously we're the ones that discovered
the laws,

460
00:24:35,010 --> 00:24:35,480
you know,
I mean,

461
00:24:35,481 --> 00:24:40,481
it's just,
it's ludicrous to make their own 

462
00:24:40,481 --> 00:24:40,880
discoveries exactly for themselves 
regardless.

463
00:24:40,881 --> 00:24:42,770
But they couldn't because they're just 
so,

464
00:24:42,830 --> 00:24:47,830
you know,
so beaten down by the oppressive 

465
00:24:47,830 --> 00:24:48,980
maleness of the discipline.
And it's just,

466
00:24:49,010 --> 00:24:50,750
it isn't true,
it's not true.

467
00:24:50,870 --> 00:24:51,830
I mean,
I could see if,

468
00:24:51,860 --> 00:24:52,770
if,
you know,

469
00:24:52,820 --> 00:24:57,020
male professors were standing up telling
these female students up,

470
00:24:57,021 --> 00:24:58,070
you're never going to,
you know,

471
00:24:58,071 --> 00:25:00,080
you don't have that right brain for it 
or whatever.

472
00:25:00,081 --> 00:25:03,020
Well that would be temporary,
but nobody is doing that.

473
00:25:03,021 --> 00:25:04,950
Nobody's doing that,
you know,

474
00:25:05,130 --> 00:25:10,130
professors are delighted to have anyone 
who's promising and capable male or 

475
00:25:10,731 --> 00:25:15,731
female or whatever color their skin is.
It just isn't the case that there are 

476
00:25:15,731 --> 00:25:16,500
all these,
you know,

477
00:25:17,240 --> 00:25:20,900
systemic barriers to participation.

478
00:25:21,370 --> 00:25:23,770
So,
so when you had these two experiences,

479
00:25:23,771 --> 00:25:28,771
so,
so nine slash 11 and then the hiring 

480
00:25:28,771 --> 00:25:28,771
process,
what I find often,

481
00:25:28,771 --> 00:25:33,391
and I think it sort of happened to me is
once you have your little wake up about 

482
00:25:33,391 --> 00:25:35,860
what this sort of uneNding monster on 
the left is,

483
00:25:36,250 --> 00:25:38,710
everything else collApses pretty 
quickly.

484
00:25:39,010 --> 00:25:41,230
So how does,
how did that collapse,

485
00:25:41,260 --> 00:25:43,600
if the rest of the collapse was pretty 
quick,

486
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:48,220
how did that lead you to where now 
you're so outspoken about feminism and a

487
00:25:48,221 --> 00:25:49,210
series of other issues?

488
00:25:49,560 --> 00:25:50,730
Yeah,
well it just,

489
00:25:50,760 --> 00:25:55,760
it did.
Everything else didn't collapsed pretty 

490
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:55,760
quickly.
And,

491
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:55,760
um,
and,

492
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:57,990
and what I became especially upset about
was,

493
00:25:58,020 --> 00:25:59,880
was the,
um,

494
00:25:59,881 --> 00:26:04,050
what I came to see as the really 
negative environment for,

495
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:06,860
for young men at,
at university because I,

496
00:26:06,861 --> 00:26:09,090
I,
I began thinking about what it must feel

497
00:26:09,091 --> 00:26:11,460
like to sit there.
They,

498
00:26:11,461 --> 00:26:15,240
after day after day,
hearing about how all the good things in

499
00:26:15,241 --> 00:26:20,241
the world are the contribution of women 
and all of the bad things or the 

500
00:26:20,241 --> 00:26:24,921
contribution of men and how,
what young men have to do today is 

501
00:26:24,921 --> 00:26:29,810
basically just take a step back,
step away from the power as professor 

502
00:26:29,941 --> 00:26:34,200
susanna walters said in that Washington 
post piece,

503
00:26:34,201 --> 00:26:35,700
uh,
why can't we hate men?

504
00:26:35,701 --> 00:26:37,290
You know,
that's what you have to do as a man.

505
00:26:37,291 --> 00:26:42,291
You have to bear the weight of centuries
of male privilege and oppressive 

506
00:26:42,291 --> 00:26:42,690
behavior.

507
00:26:42,810 --> 00:26:45,330
And you just have to step back.
Don't run for office,

508
00:26:45,331 --> 00:26:46,590
don't do anything.
I mean,

509
00:26:46,650 --> 00:26:47,340
you know,
as if.

510
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:48,810
I mean,
it's unbelievable.

511
00:26:48,811 --> 00:26:51,480
But yeah,
basically,

512
00:26:51,481 --> 00:26:52,390
yeah,
and know,

513
00:26:52,430 --> 00:26:56,580
be abject,
apologize for your soul called privilege

514
00:26:56,610 --> 00:27:00,720
and let your sisters come forward and 
make the world a better place.

515
00:27:00,910 --> 00:27:02,200
And that is,
I mean,

516
00:27:02,220 --> 00:27:07,220
that it's so crUde and so ridiculous,
but I don't think it's an exaggeration 

517
00:27:07,220 --> 00:27:11,451
to say that that is the message that 
most young men are getting at university

518
00:27:11,641 --> 00:27:14,880
today,
that the only way to be a good man is to

519
00:27:14,881 --> 00:27:19,881
focus all of your energy and attention 
on someone else.

520
00:27:20,071 --> 00:27:21,320
Whether it's so,
um,

521
00:27:21,410 --> 00:27:22,020
you know,
on,

522
00:27:22,050 --> 00:27:27,050
on helping women or in helping the 
indigenous or whatever it happens to be 

523
00:27:27,050 --> 00:27:31,520
that you can't have your own concerns,
you can't have your own needs and you 

524
00:27:31,891 --> 00:27:34,950
certainly can't have your own problems 
or issues.

525
00:27:35,270 --> 00:27:40,270
Um,
that's the only way you can be a good 

526
00:27:40,270 --> 00:27:40,270
person.
So,

527
00:27:40,270 --> 00:27:40,270
yeah.
Um,

528
00:27:40,450 --> 00:27:42,720
I,
it just seemed to me outrageous.

529
00:27:42,721 --> 00:27:47,100
And I kept waiting for other people like
to say something about it.

530
00:27:47,101 --> 00:27:49,260
And I would occasionally talk to others 
about it and they'd say,

531
00:27:49,261 --> 00:27:50,610
oh yeah,
they could sort of see.

532
00:27:50,611 --> 00:27:52,210
But they,
you know,

533
00:27:52,211 --> 00:27:55,500
they weren't willing to stick their 
necks out in any way.

534
00:27:55,830 --> 00:27:59,220
And um,
so finally I just got to the point where

535
00:27:59,221 --> 00:27:59,850
I thought,
well,

536
00:27:59,851 --> 00:28:00,990
I should do it.

537
00:28:01,030 --> 00:28:06,030
That's a weird position to be in because
I do find so many of the people that 

538
00:28:06,030 --> 00:28:06,870
I've talked to that have had similar 
evolutions to you,

539
00:28:07,510 --> 00:28:11,430
they don't think of themselves as 
particularly brave or particularly like,

540
00:28:11,450 --> 00:28:16,450
oh,
he's the one that wanted to save the 

541
00:28:16,450 --> 00:28:16,590
world or anything,
but you get pushed to a point where then

542
00:28:16,591 --> 00:28:21,591
finally you're at that ledge and it's 
either they're going to push you over 

543
00:28:21,591 --> 00:28:24,621
and you'll never speak again and they'll
disappear or you kind of turn it around 

544
00:28:24,621 --> 00:28:24,621
and fight back.

545
00:28:24,900 --> 00:28:27,100
Yeah,
I mean in my case I,

546
00:28:27,101 --> 00:28:29,500
I,
especially I,

547
00:28:29,970 --> 00:28:34,970
it's not that I don't,
I because I do get a rush out of 

548
00:28:34,970 --> 00:28:36,810
conflict and that sort of thing,
but for this particular issue,

549
00:28:36,811 --> 00:28:38,670
I don't think I'm very good at it.
I mean,

550
00:28:38,671 --> 00:28:43,671
for one thing it's very difficult to be 
on the other side of a social justice 

551
00:28:44,071 --> 00:28:47,430
issue because to be on the right side,
the left side,

552
00:28:48,140 --> 00:28:51,510
you have the correct side.
I should say the left side,

553
00:28:51,690 --> 00:28:55,080
it's easy because you hear the arguments
over and over again,

554
00:28:55,081 --> 00:28:56,670
so you just,
you know,

555
00:28:56,780 --> 00:28:59,520
we just have to open your mouth and out.
They all come and,

556
00:28:59,730 --> 00:29:04,290
and usually people are stunned into 
embarrassed silence as soon as you start

557
00:29:04,291 --> 00:29:05,550
attacking them with your,
your,

558
00:29:05,551 --> 00:29:08,310
your various claims and your various 
charges against them.

559
00:29:08,610 --> 00:29:13,610
But to be able to argue,
I'm really effectively on the other 

560
00:29:13,610 --> 00:29:13,610
side.

561
00:29:13,610 --> 00:29:15,090
You not only have to know the,
the,

562
00:29:15,140 --> 00:29:18,060
all the left side arguments,
but then you have to,

563
00:29:18,061 --> 00:29:19,230
you know,
research all,

564
00:29:19,620 --> 00:29:23,940
all these things that you'd been taught 
were simply not true or were unthinkable

565
00:29:23,941 --> 00:29:27,300
or were impossible.
and um,

566
00:29:27,930 --> 00:29:28,800
yeah,
it's not,

567
00:29:28,860 --> 00:29:31,290
not my area of expertise.
Certainly,

568
00:29:31,560 --> 00:29:32,340
um,
you know,

569
00:29:32,341 --> 00:29:34,690
my area of expertise is literature,
but um,

570
00:29:34,890 --> 00:29:39,890
and I don't think I'm very good.
Like you have to be good in debate and 

571
00:29:39,890 --> 00:29:42,160
you know,
answering people's challenging questions

572
00:29:42,161 --> 00:29:44,530
and I hate all that.
I'm terrible at that.

573
00:29:44,531 --> 00:29:45,390
But,
but,

574
00:29:45,391 --> 00:29:48,450
and so if there were two.
yeah,

575
00:29:48,460 --> 00:29:50,050
so,
and I didn't really,

576
00:29:50,051 --> 00:29:50,620
you know,
and I,

577
00:29:50,621 --> 00:29:54,140
I didn't entirely understand,
um,

578
00:29:54,280 --> 00:29:59,280
what it would be like,
like when I gave my first couple of 

579
00:29:59,280 --> 00:30:02,011
talks and uh,
they were protested and they pulled the 

580
00:30:02,011 --> 00:30:05,140
fire alarms and there were a lot of 
really angry students in the audience.

581
00:30:05,140 --> 00:30:07,480
I really had no idea that it was going 
to be like that.

582
00:30:07,481 --> 00:30:12,481
I thought it was just going to.
I was sort of going to talk about 

583
00:30:12,481 --> 00:30:13,690
academic feminism in a,
in a sort of bounded way.

584
00:30:13,691 --> 00:30:16,240
And I knew that because I'd studied it 
for years,

585
00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:19,720
but I didn't realize I was going to be 
asked to answer questions about,

586
00:30:19,740 --> 00:30:23,220
you know,
everything do with the relations between

587
00:30:23,221 --> 00:30:27,660
men and women and rape and all of these 
big issues.

588
00:30:27,930 --> 00:30:30,120
So I didn't do a very good job.
I didn't think,

589
00:30:30,180 --> 00:30:31,020
but,
um,

590
00:30:31,260 --> 00:30:31,830
but,
you know,

591
00:30:32,250 --> 00:30:37,250
nobody else is doing it.
And so I want to keep on.

592
00:30:37,291 --> 00:30:41,970
And I started doing my video series 
three years ago and um,

593
00:30:42,570 --> 00:30:47,570
and that has given me a lot of 
satisfaction actually because as soon as

594
00:30:47,941 --> 00:30:52,800
I started speaking in public,
I got a lot of emails,

595
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:57,390
an incredible number of emails,
mostly from young men,

596
00:30:57,391 --> 00:31:02,040
some men not that young talking about 
their experiences.

597
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:07,400
And it blew me away that the,
and I know darden's talked about this 

598
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:07,620
too,
but the,

599
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:12,540
the amount of pain that there is out 
there,

600
00:31:12,790 --> 00:31:17,790
um,
the number of young men who just want 

601
00:31:19,021 --> 00:31:22,140
to,
they love women in most cases.

602
00:31:22,141 --> 00:31:27,141
They want to have a happy relationship.
they've never intended to hurt or 

603
00:31:27,961 --> 00:31:32,961
oppress anyone.
And yet they're told that even without 

604
00:31:32,961 --> 00:31:36,711
intending to,
they do just by looking at a young 

605
00:31:36,711 --> 00:31:37,070
woman,
you know,

606
00:31:37,090 --> 00:31:42,090
or asking her out on a date.
They're doing some sort of violence and 

607
00:31:42,090 --> 00:31:46,911
the pain that that has caused and the 
uncertainty and the confusion and the 

608
00:31:47,431 --> 00:31:50,490
resentment as well.
It's a,

609
00:31:50,520 --> 00:31:55,520
you know,
in some of these young men have 

610
00:31:55,520 --> 00:31:55,520
themselves been abused.
Their parents.

611
00:31:55,520 --> 00:32:00,021
Sometimes their mothers have been 
abusive or girlfriends.

612
00:32:00,450 --> 00:32:01,440
And yet they're in,
you know,

613
00:32:01,510 --> 00:32:06,510
they have to hear over and over again 
about how it's only men who are ever 

614
00:32:06,510 --> 00:32:06,510
abusive.

615
00:32:06,630 --> 00:32:08,660
And that's,
I mean,

616
00:32:08,661 --> 00:32:13,661
it's amazing to me like once you go into
down the rabbit hole or whatever it is,

617
00:32:14,821 --> 00:32:16,350
and you see the,
the,

618
00:32:16,560 --> 00:32:20,460
our culture from the other side,
and every time you turn on the news,

619
00:32:20,461 --> 00:32:22,410
there's yet another story about,
you know,

620
00:32:22,411 --> 00:32:27,270
whatever the terrible problem of cat 
calling and how it represents,

621
00:32:27,271 --> 00:32:27,960
you know,
the,

622
00:32:27,961 --> 00:32:32,961
the,
the deep misogyny of north american 

623
00:32:32,961 --> 00:32:33,720
culture and what needs to be done about 
it and,

624
00:32:33,780 --> 00:32:34,920
you know,
all that kind of thing kind of thing.

625
00:32:35,580 --> 00:32:36,630
Um,
yeah,

626
00:32:36,631 --> 00:32:38,250
it's,
it's astounding.

627
00:32:38,251 --> 00:32:43,251
So,
so now I sort of feel like I'm with my 

628
00:32:43,251 --> 00:32:43,251
video is anyway,
that my,

629
00:32:43,390 --> 00:32:48,390
my role is to at least to say to young 
men that you're not crazy.

630
00:32:49,970 --> 00:32:51,340
It,
our culture is,

631
00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:52,760
is actually crazy.

632
00:32:53,030 --> 00:32:58,030
All right,
so let's talk about this crisis in 

633
00:32:58,030 --> 00:32:58,030
masculinity.
Uh,

634
00:32:58,030 --> 00:32:59,010
is that,
is that the right way to phrase it?

635
00:32:59,040 --> 00:33:00,110
Do you think these?
Sure.

636
00:33:00,180 --> 00:33:01,050
Yeah,
that's fine.

637
00:33:01,051 --> 00:33:01,830
Yeah,
that'll work.

638
00:33:01,831 --> 00:33:06,831
Okay.
That there do seem to be so many men 

639
00:33:06,831 --> 00:33:06,831
who,
as you said,

640
00:33:06,831 --> 00:33:07,580
they don't hate women,
they,

641
00:33:07,581 --> 00:33:09,270
they,
they don't hate themselves,

642
00:33:09,271 --> 00:33:09,830
they don't,
they,

643
00:33:09,900 --> 00:33:12,120
but they're sort of wounded and 
confused.

644
00:33:12,450 --> 00:33:17,340
I see these people often at jordan's 
shows and I don't even mean that,

645
00:33:17,341 --> 00:33:22,341
that shows her filled with these people.
There's just people that are kind of 

646
00:33:22,341 --> 00:33:23,640
confused.
Their roadmap is a little screwed up and

647
00:33:23,641 --> 00:33:25,840
he's kind of helping them get back on 
the road.

648
00:33:25,841 --> 00:33:30,841
I don't,
he doesn't even talk about gender that 

649
00:33:30,841 --> 00:33:30,841
often or,
or any of that stuff.

650
00:33:30,841 --> 00:33:34,340
For whatever reason,
his broader message of clean up your 

651
00:33:34,340 --> 00:33:34,340
room,
get your stuff together,

652
00:33:34,340 --> 00:33:38,901
fix yourself before you fix the world.
That seems to be a message that these 

653
00:33:39,391 --> 00:33:44,391
people are hearing this crisis.
Are you able to really figure out how 

654
00:33:44,391 --> 00:33:45,060
widespread it is?
I mean,

655
00:33:45,061 --> 00:33:47,190
I know you're getting,
you're getting sort of emails and you're

656
00:33:47,191 --> 00:33:48,870
putting up your video series and all 
that,

657
00:33:48,871 --> 00:33:53,871
but like can you really tell like how 
much of this as just sort of gone across

658
00:33:54,271 --> 00:33:59,271
culture because it does seem to sort of 
be the beginnings of the next culture 

659
00:33:59,271 --> 00:33:59,271
war?

660
00:33:59,271 --> 00:33:59,390
Yeah,
I mean,

661
00:33:59,391 --> 00:33:59,690
I,
I,

662
00:33:59,691 --> 00:34:00,240
yeah,
I,

663
00:34:00,241 --> 00:34:02,270
it's,
it's hard to say exactly.

664
00:34:02,300 --> 00:34:07,300
I mean,
certainly at the university there has 

665
00:34:07,300 --> 00:34:09,110
been a tremendous decline in men 
attending net.

666
00:34:09,111 --> 00:34:13,310
Women now dominate in numbers at pretty 
well,

667
00:34:13,390 --> 00:34:14,690
you know,
every university,

668
00:34:14,691 --> 00:34:18,770
at least in north America,
and I assume it's true in western europe

669
00:34:18,771 --> 00:34:19,820
as well.
Now,

670
00:34:19,821 --> 00:34:24,821
there might be lots of reasons for that,
but one has to assume that at least a 

671
00:34:24,821 --> 00:34:29,471
part of the reason is that men feel that
there isn't a place for them at the 

672
00:34:29,541 --> 00:34:30,980
university.
Um,

673
00:34:31,030 --> 00:34:36,030
and it,
the relentless man blaming and shaming 

674
00:34:36,030 --> 00:34:38,390
that goes on there has got to have 
something to do with that I would think.

675
00:34:38,810 --> 00:34:43,810
Um,
and there are a number of reports 

676
00:34:43,810 --> 00:34:47,051
certainly that I've read recently 
indicate that in a whole bunch of other 

677
00:34:47,051 --> 00:34:51,401
ways,
men are just not doing very well 

678
00:34:51,401 --> 00:34:54,820
generally either.
There was a report that came out a few 

679
00:34:54,820 --> 00:34:56,390
years ago called I'm a wayward sons.

680
00:34:56,420 --> 00:35:01,420
It came out of mit to economists talking
about how,

681
00:35:01,910 --> 00:35:06,290
um,
in a number of different metrics,

682
00:35:06,291 --> 00:35:09,260
um,
whether it was skills acquisition,

683
00:35:09,620 --> 00:35:14,620
a real wages,
I'm just employment numbers.

684
00:35:15,370 --> 00:35:17,240
Um,
job status.

685
00:35:17,620 --> 00:35:22,430
Men are falling behind women really 
shockingly,

686
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:25,970
and then that's leading into all sorts 
of other social problems too.

687
00:35:26,030 --> 00:35:31,030
Men are not getting married because 
they're not in a position to be able to 

688
00:35:31,030 --> 00:35:35,321
support a family and there are many 
other reasons why men are not getting 

689
00:35:35,321 --> 00:35:36,770
married as well.
And so Then that means that I'm more and

690
00:35:36,771 --> 00:35:41,771
more women are,
are raising their children outside of 

691
00:35:42,030 --> 00:35:47,030
marriage and that often has very bad 
impacts for the boys in those single mom

692
00:35:49,391 --> 00:35:51,150
situations.
Um,

693
00:35:51,210 --> 00:35:51,710
they,
they,

694
00:35:51,720 --> 00:35:56,430
they tend to be the ones that are hurt 
most by the lack of a father.

695
00:35:56,431 --> 00:35:58,140
And,
and so yeah,

696
00:35:58,141 --> 00:36:01,860
it certainly seems that there's some 
pretty widespread problems.

697
00:36:01,861 --> 00:36:06,861
Suicide,
male suicide is something that a lot of 

698
00:36:06,861 --> 00:36:10,770
people that I work with are very 
concerned about mental illness,

699
00:36:10,970 --> 00:36:12,990
uh,
what they call failure to launch,

700
00:36:12,991 --> 00:36:17,991
meaning just a lot of young men just 
feeling that there isn't anything for 

701
00:36:17,991 --> 00:36:21,501
them in society.
And so why even try to contribute 

702
00:36:21,660 --> 00:36:26,660
anything to it at all.
It does seem to be a pretty widespread 

703
00:36:26,660 --> 00:36:27,810
problem from what people like warren 
farrell,

704
00:36:27,811 --> 00:36:31,260
who studied the subject for years 
certainly.

705
00:36:31,261 --> 00:36:33,390
And of course christina hoff sommers as 
well,

706
00:36:33,391 --> 00:36:33,640
or.
Yeah.

707
00:36:33,700 --> 00:36:38,700
What,
what are the tactics that you've seen 

708
00:36:38,700 --> 00:36:39,970
work effectively to,
if someone contacts you and you know,

709
00:36:39,971 --> 00:36:44,971
they're,
they're feeling all of the things that 

710
00:36:44,971 --> 00:36:44,971
you've discussed or not feeling,
what they're experiencing,

711
00:36:47,620 --> 00:36:52,620
do you have a sorta a groundwork for how
they can kind of get their lives in 

712
00:36:52,620 --> 00:36:54,010
order and,
and fight some of this.

713
00:36:54,580 --> 00:36:56,350
It's really just,
you're just making them aware.

714
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:58,290
Yeah,
I mean I'd be friends with them and,

715
00:36:58,291 --> 00:36:59,610
and uh,
and I,

716
00:36:59,730 --> 00:37:03,030
I tell them that what they're feeling 
has a real basis.

717
00:37:03,031 --> 00:37:08,031
I mean that part of the problem is that 
they're told that they're their only 

718
00:37:08,031 --> 00:37:09,290
problem is a sense of entitlement,
you know,

719
00:37:09,330 --> 00:37:14,250
which is the last thing that's true 
about men's experience today.

720
00:37:14,460 --> 00:37:16,760
So part of the thing is that,
I mean,

721
00:37:16,770 --> 00:37:19,350
I think many of the young men that write
to me,

722
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:24,920
it's not that they necessarily think 
they're the biggest victims in the 

723
00:37:24,920 --> 00:37:28,920
world.
It's that there is not even a smidgen of

724
00:37:28,921 --> 00:37:33,921
awareness that they would ever have 
anything to worry about.

725
00:37:34,380 --> 00:37:37,860
The sense that you know,
everything that they have.

726
00:37:37,890 --> 00:37:41,100
It's because they're so privileged.
I'm

727
00:37:41,180 --> 00:37:43,490
so,
what a weird ways is through that lens.

728
00:37:43,491 --> 00:37:45,080
It's like society,
you should have everything.

729
00:37:45,081 --> 00:37:46,250
You should feel great.
Look,

730
00:37:46,251 --> 00:37:51,251
you've been handed everything,
but then is continually making you feel 

731
00:37:51,251 --> 00:37:55,001
like crap,
which is like a completely double edge 

732
00:37:55,001 --> 00:37:55,001
sword because you're supposed to feel 
great.

733
00:37:55,001 --> 00:37:56,720
You feel like crap.
They're never given you a chance to feel

734
00:37:56,721 --> 00:37:59,690
good because there's nothing you can do 
to get yourself out of it.

735
00:37:59,830 --> 00:38:00,700
Yeah.
And it's,

736
00:38:00,730 --> 00:38:01,510
it's.
I mean,

737
00:38:01,511 --> 00:38:02,590
I,
I think it's a,

738
00:38:02,620 --> 00:38:07,180
it is a devastating social problem.
Um,

739
00:38:08,830 --> 00:38:09,430
and again,
yeah,

740
00:38:09,431 --> 00:38:12,310
I don't know the exact extent of the 
problem,

741
00:38:12,340 --> 00:38:17,340
but from what people who know and have 
studied it more certainly indicating 

742
00:38:17,340 --> 00:38:18,640
that it is a growing problem.
And,

743
00:38:18,670 --> 00:38:19,630
and,
um,

744
00:38:19,660 --> 00:38:20,750
you know,
in the circles that,

745
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:22,410
that I sort of,
um,

746
00:38:22,600 --> 00:38:24,040
pay attention to,
you know,

747
00:38:24,041 --> 00:38:29,041
there's this movement called meg towel,
which I'm know you know about and I'm a 

748
00:38:29,041 --> 00:38:32,680
man who are just have decided the 
acronym breakdown to men going their own

749
00:38:32,681 --> 00:38:33,210
way.
Yeah.

750
00:38:33,450 --> 00:38:33,950
Yeah.
And,

751
00:38:33,951 --> 00:38:36,160
and I'm not an on,
on meg towels.

752
00:38:36,180 --> 00:38:39,370
Certainly women who are we fighting for,
for,

753
00:38:39,371 --> 00:38:40,030
uh,
for,

754
00:38:40,150 --> 00:38:42,160
for them to think of me pronouncing on 
it,

755
00:38:42,161 --> 00:38:42,880
I'm sure,
but,

756
00:38:42,881 --> 00:38:47,881
um,
and there can be different reasons and 

757
00:38:47,881 --> 00:38:47,881
in the most,
in the broadest definition,

758
00:38:47,881 --> 00:38:49,450
I think it's just men saying,
look,

759
00:38:49,451 --> 00:38:54,451
I'm going to focus my life around my own
pursuits and I'm not going to focus my 

760
00:38:56,411 --> 00:38:57,610
life around a woman.

761
00:38:57,880 --> 00:39:01,660
And these men tend to think that 
actually that's a trap that a lot of men

762
00:39:01,690 --> 00:39:05,260
fall into is,
is making everything about a woman.

763
00:39:05,680 --> 00:39:07,480
Um,
and then you can get,

764
00:39:07,610 --> 00:39:09,700
you know,
really can be destroyed if you,

765
00:39:09,701 --> 00:39:14,701
if the woman you happen to focus your 
life around is crazy or malevolent in 

766
00:39:15,641 --> 00:39:20,020
some way,
she can destroy her man.

767
00:39:20,070 --> 00:39:22,450
Um,
by making a claim of abuse,

768
00:39:22,780 --> 00:39:24,370
he can find that,
um,

769
00:39:24,460 --> 00:39:27,640
the marriage he built,
the home that he built,

770
00:39:27,670 --> 00:39:31,360
the children that he fathered all can be
taken away from him.

771
00:39:31,361 --> 00:39:33,940
His life can be destroyed,
his business can be taken away,

772
00:39:33,941 --> 00:39:35,830
his reputation could be ruined.
You know,

773
00:39:35,840 --> 00:39:36,960
all of those things.
And,

774
00:39:37,160 --> 00:39:42,160
and so there's so much risk to these 
young men in these involvements that a 

775
00:39:42,401 --> 00:39:45,220
lot of them are just deciding a safer 
not to,

776
00:39:46,180 --> 00:39:49,510
not to risk anything,
but I think there's a more general thing

777
00:39:49,511 --> 00:39:49,750
too.

778
00:39:49,750 --> 00:39:51,470
It's just,
um,

779
00:39:51,730 --> 00:39:56,730
anyone it has to do with that sense that
every day in some way,

780
00:39:57,760 --> 00:40:02,760
some of these men are beginning to feel 
like their society just doesn't even 

781
00:40:02,760 --> 00:40:04,210
like them.
It's not even that they're expendable,

782
00:40:04,211 --> 00:40:09,211
which I think most men who have studied 
the situation of men throughout history 

783
00:40:09,211 --> 00:40:11,290
would say that's always been the case.
Men have always been,

784
00:40:11,291 --> 00:40:12,850
yeah,
men are the ones that go to war.

785
00:40:12,851 --> 00:40:14,740
Why to,
to protect the women.

786
00:40:14,920 --> 00:40:19,240
So this idea that all of human history 
is about male power and privilege and,

787
00:40:19,241 --> 00:40:21,930
and men abusing women.
Um,

788
00:40:22,010 --> 00:40:27,010
you know,
these men and say it's actually the 

789
00:40:27,010 --> 00:40:27,010
exact opposite.
Um,

790
00:40:27,010 --> 00:40:29,080
women have always been the ones who are 
precious in society,

791
00:40:29,350 --> 00:40:33,250
particularly in western society and know
chivalry and everything else.

792
00:40:33,580 --> 00:40:37,180
Um,
so that was always the situation.

793
00:40:37,181 --> 00:40:42,181
But expandability is one thing.
But to be actually despised by your 

794
00:40:42,181 --> 00:40:43,180
years,
your society,

795
00:40:43,181 --> 00:40:45,370
and told that there's nothing good about
you,

796
00:40:45,371 --> 00:40:50,371
that even your sacrifices aren't good 
enough and yet you're still supposed to 

797
00:40:50,371 --> 00:40:51,970
make the sacrifices.
But they'll never,

798
00:40:52,180 --> 00:40:57,180
you'll never get any,
any kind of public acknowledgement of 

799
00:40:57,180 --> 00:40:58,120
that.
Why we say it's bOwing forever.

800
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:02,460
There is no reclamation here.
It's,

801
00:41:02,461 --> 00:41:06,400
it's a,
it's a perpetual stay there.

802
00:41:06,430 --> 00:41:11,430
Yeah.
You can never purge your toxic 

803
00:41:11,430 --> 00:41:12,100
masculinity no matter what you do,
unless you die,

804
00:41:12,101 --> 00:41:12,890
I guess,
you know,

805
00:41:12,900 --> 00:41:14,380
rescuing somebody.
But,

806
00:41:14,381 --> 00:41:15,440
uh,
but even then,

807
00:41:16,120 --> 00:41:17,280
yeah,
yeah,

808
00:41:17,290 --> 00:41:19,000
I mean,
and then that gets flipped over and then

809
00:41:19,001 --> 00:41:20,460
that's an example of,
you know,

810
00:41:20,530 --> 00:41:21,670
patriarchal,
you know,

811
00:41:21,690 --> 00:41:23,590
objectification of women or something.
I mean,

812
00:41:23,591 --> 00:41:24,940
it really is like,
it's,

813
00:41:24,970 --> 00:41:28,120
it's sick when you,
when you listen to.

814
00:41:28,270 --> 00:41:30,880
I mean,
I've read lately so many studies.

815
00:41:30,881 --> 00:41:32,200
One about,
um,

816
00:41:32,201 --> 00:41:36,590
this was by a feminist sociologist and 
sociology is really,

817
00:41:36,710 --> 00:41:38,000
I mean,
it's just crazy.

818
00:41:38,210 --> 00:41:43,210
this was a woman who has done work with 
the homeless in ontario.

819
00:41:44,900 --> 00:41:49,900
And her whole shtick was about how I'm 
even amongst the homeless a certain,

820
00:41:53,890 --> 00:41:58,890
um,
ideas associated with hegemonic 

821
00:41:58,890 --> 00:42:00,700
masculinity could still be found in,
in,

822
00:42:00,740 --> 00:42:05,740
she interviewed various homeless men and
the fact that the homeless are 

823
00:42:07,401 --> 00:42:09,760
overwhelmingly men right away,
you know,

824
00:42:09,780 --> 00:42:12,260
it shouldn't be for it points to 
something.

825
00:42:12,260 --> 00:42:15,890
Doesn't it say something about male 
privilege in our society that you,

826
00:42:15,920 --> 00:42:17,960
yeah,
you walk around the streets of ottawa,

827
00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:23,480
you almost never see a homeless woman.
you see a lot of homeless men and a lot 

828
00:42:23,480 --> 00:42:26,140
of homeless white men as well as 
homeless anyway.

829
00:42:26,180 --> 00:42:27,020
Men.
Um,

830
00:42:27,021 --> 00:42:32,021
anyways,
so she had done thIs work with homeless 

831
00:42:32,021 --> 00:42:32,021
men and,
and uh,

832
00:42:32,021 --> 00:42:36,040
and she interviewed them and yeah,
she found that either either they were 

833
00:42:36,040 --> 00:42:39,461
lamenting the loss of their hegemonic 
masculinity or they were even so trying 

834
00:42:40,851 --> 00:42:44,390
to assert their hegemonic masculinity in
various ways.

835
00:42:44,391 --> 00:42:45,110
I mean,
it was just,

836
00:42:45,111 --> 00:42:48,860
it was truly crazy.
It had nothing to do.

837
00:42:48,861 --> 00:42:53,861
And she actually recommended at the end 
of the article that program's working 

838
00:42:53,871 --> 00:42:57,380
with these men should perhaps,
you know,

839
00:42:57,410 --> 00:43:02,240
help them to whatever renounced their 
hegemonic masculinity.

840
00:43:02,360 --> 00:43:03,050
There was another

841
00:43:03,080 --> 00:43:04,640
article that's obviously their number 
one.

842
00:43:04,690 --> 00:43:06,130
Yeah,
that's their number one problem.

843
00:43:06,131 --> 00:43:07,540
I mean,
it's just unbelievable.

844
00:43:07,541 --> 00:43:12,541
There was another article I read just 
recently saying that the programs to 

845
00:43:12,541 --> 00:43:16,410
encourage men to be responsible fathers.
This was,

846
00:43:16,781 --> 00:43:19,810
I think these were american programs.
I think she was studying,

847
00:43:20,140 --> 00:43:25,140
um,
that such programs also reinforce 

848
00:43:25,140 --> 00:43:27,990
patriarchal because they reinforce this 
idea that um,

849
00:43:28,110 --> 00:43:33,110
you know,
men have an important role to play as 

850
00:43:33,110 --> 00:43:35,191
fathers.
And she actually said that this was a 

851
00:43:35,191 --> 00:43:38,641
typical reassertion of patriarchal 
thinking in that the implicit assumption

852
00:43:39,401 --> 00:43:44,401
was that women that mothers aren't 
sufficient for their children.

853
00:43:45,460 --> 00:43:50,460
So I mean she basically outright said 
that that children don't need fathers 

854
00:43:50,471 --> 00:43:54,250
and fathers have no necessary role In 
their children's lives.

855
00:43:55,360 --> 00:43:57,120
So a lot of scientific evidence at that 
time.

856
00:43:57,220 --> 00:43:58,910
That's not correct.
Exactly,

857
00:43:58,911 --> 00:44:01,310
yeah.
That it's deeply damaging to children.

858
00:44:01,520 --> 00:44:06,520
Do you sense that there's a movement now
for women and I think you'd probably be 

859
00:44:06,921 --> 00:44:11,000
included in this,
but that young women that are looking to

860
00:44:11,001 --> 00:44:12,420
get married and in their,
you know,

861
00:44:12,440 --> 00:44:14,210
late teens,
early twenties,

862
00:44:14,900 --> 00:44:19,900
that they want men back.
So I can only give an anecdotal example 

863
00:44:20,751 --> 00:44:22,400
of this,
but I have a lot of single,

864
00:44:22,460 --> 00:44:25,490
straight female friends that have their 
lives together,

865
00:44:25,491 --> 00:44:28,070
have jobs,
take care of themselves,

866
00:44:28,110 --> 00:44:29,060
etc.
Etc.

867
00:44:29,540 --> 00:44:34,540
And we have this running joke that I 
don't know virtually any straight men 

868
00:44:36,151 --> 00:44:41,151
like that.
I know a lot of gay guys that seemingly 

869
00:44:41,151 --> 00:44:43,311
have their lives together and that are 
doing all of those things and that's 

870
00:44:43,311 --> 00:44:44,040
probably.
I don't know if you have any thoughts on

871
00:44:44,041 --> 00:44:46,230
that.
It's sorta kinda decide barb,

872
00:44:46,231 --> 00:44:48,870
it's sort of interesting,
but that they're,

873
00:44:49,140 --> 00:44:53,340
they want there to be men to find and 
it's become like a running joke for me.

874
00:44:53,341 --> 00:44:54,870
Like I don't know where they are.

875
00:44:55,620 --> 00:44:57,310
Yeah.
Well yeah,

876
00:44:58,450 --> 00:45:03,450
I think those women are going to have to
start asking why it is that they're not 

877
00:45:03,450 --> 00:45:04,590
there.
And some of the,

878
00:45:04,610 --> 00:45:08,650
the reason I would say is precisely that
they're just not,

879
00:45:09,160 --> 00:45:13,210
they're not willing anymore to be there 
because it isn't possible.

880
00:45:13,360 --> 00:45:18,360
I mean obviously there are lots of men 
who are still willing to take on 

881
00:45:18,360 --> 00:45:20,140
responsibility and be the achievers and 
all of that.

882
00:45:20,410 --> 00:45:23,170
But I think there has been sort of a 
general,

883
00:45:23,530 --> 00:45:25,680
um,
a lot of men are,

884
00:45:25,681 --> 00:45:30,550
are disgusted with the,
the paucity of options that are,

885
00:45:30,670 --> 00:45:33,640
that are offered to them and they feel 
that,

886
00:45:33,780 --> 00:45:34,720
um,
you know,

887
00:45:34,970 --> 00:45:39,970
just there,
there are too many risks for them 

888
00:45:39,970 --> 00:45:43,060
involved in doing the things that they 
might have once wanted to do.

889
00:45:43,540 --> 00:45:45,280
Um,
and I think a lot of men are,

890
00:45:45,281 --> 00:45:50,281
are damaged too from the,
the decades of relentless propaganda,

891
00:45:52,091 --> 00:45:53,770
anti male propaganda.

892
00:45:53,990 --> 00:45:56,660
How do you think this is all connected 
to the me too movement?

893
00:45:56,661 --> 00:45:59,540
So I just want to be clear on one thing.
So as we're taping this,

894
00:45:59,541 --> 00:46:01,310
because I'm on tour with Jordan at the 
moment,

895
00:46:01,520 --> 00:46:03,110
we are holding this video for a little 
bit.

896
00:46:03,111 --> 00:46:08,111
So the moment we're taping this right 
now is the cabin our hearings and it 

897
00:46:08,111 --> 00:46:09,980
just feels like everything that you've,
uh,

898
00:46:10,220 --> 00:46:12,470
talked about here for the last 45 or so 
minutes.

899
00:46:12,830 --> 00:46:17,000
It seems like it's all being unearthed 
now publicly in our political arena.

900
00:46:17,001 --> 00:46:22,001
That's why I think this is so much more 
of a culture thing than a political 

901
00:46:22,001 --> 00:46:26,021
thing directly.
But can you relate all of this to me 

902
00:46:26,021 --> 00:46:26,021
too?

903
00:46:26,021 --> 00:46:26,930
Well,
there's so much about me too.

904
00:46:26,931 --> 00:46:31,931
I mean,
I think partly what me to represented 

905
00:46:31,931 --> 00:46:35,141
for me anyway,
I'm like so many women have been told 

906
00:46:35,660 --> 00:46:40,660
for so many years that the whole history
of our culture is a history of male 

907
00:46:42,051 --> 00:46:43,730
privilege.
And so,

908
00:46:43,760 --> 00:46:44,840
but in fact,
you know,

909
00:46:44,841 --> 00:46:46,210
most women,
um,

910
00:46:46,250 --> 00:46:51,250
least I would say lower middle class to 
upper middle class women have had lives 

911
00:46:53,211 --> 00:46:57,500
in which they have been told from day 
one that they really matter.

912
00:46:57,560 --> 00:46:59,630
Certainly that was my experience.
I never,

913
00:46:59,640 --> 00:47:01,220
you know,
I was born in 1964,

914
00:47:01,221 --> 00:47:06,221
so I'm going back to the,
I guess I was the beneficiary of the 

915
00:47:06,590 --> 00:47:11,590
second wave feminist movement.
And certainly I always knew that 

916
00:47:11,590 --> 00:47:14,510
everybody in my life,
all of the people at my school,

917
00:47:14,511 --> 00:47:16,190
you know,
all the coaches,

918
00:47:16,191 --> 00:47:18,470
the mentors,
the teachers,

919
00:47:19,380 --> 00:47:22,490
they wanted me to do well.
And I think a lot of women have had that

920
00:47:22,491 --> 00:47:23,000
message.

921
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:27,110
new you can do whatever you want to do 
and we encourage you to go,

922
00:47:27,111 --> 00:47:27,830
girl,
you know,

923
00:47:27,831 --> 00:47:29,060
you can be great.
You can be a,

924
00:47:29,550 --> 00:47:32,140
a rocket scientist.
You can do something else,

925
00:47:32,141 --> 00:47:32,630
you know,
and,

926
00:47:32,631 --> 00:47:34,780
and whatever you do,
you'll be supported in it,

927
00:47:34,900 --> 00:47:39,900
but at the same time though,
as an antifeminist now second wave 

928
00:47:39,900 --> 00:47:40,000
feminism back then.
Pretty good.

929
00:47:40,900 --> 00:47:41,560
Oh,
well,

930
00:47:42,400 --> 00:47:44,010
that's a whole other.
Oh,

931
00:47:44,050 --> 00:47:49,050
I mean,
it had the seeds of the deep patriot of 

932
00:47:49,050 --> 00:47:49,050
men in it.
I mean,

933
00:47:49,050 --> 00:47:53,730
it was the one that started a rape 
culture and the history of women was a 

934
00:47:53,921 --> 00:47:58,921
history of male sexual violence and the 
men kept women in check by,

935
00:47:59,590 --> 00:48:03,520
by sexually abusing them or by 
threatening them with sexual abuse.

936
00:48:03,521 --> 00:48:06,460
When you said that you,
that you were born out of that,

937
00:48:06,560 --> 00:48:07,860
that things were okay.
Well,

938
00:48:07,870 --> 00:48:10,210
certainly things were wonderful in the 
19 seventies.

939
00:48:10,210 --> 00:48:15,210
I mean,
my argument would be that they would 

940
00:48:15,210 --> 00:48:15,210
have been pretty good anyway.
I think,

941
00:48:15,210 --> 00:48:19,380
you know,
I think ever since women got the vote 

942
00:48:19,380 --> 00:48:20,620
and men,
we're happy to extend it to them without

943
00:48:20,621 --> 00:48:25,060
any of the responsibilities that men who
had the vote had always had to take on,

944
00:48:25,061 --> 00:48:30,061
such as military service and the 
willingness to die for you're defending 

945
00:48:30,061 --> 00:48:30,290
your country.
Uh,

946
00:48:30,300 --> 00:48:32,560
I think everything every ever since that
happened,

947
00:48:32,561 --> 00:48:37,561
basically men have shown themselves 
pretty open to admitting women into the 

948
00:48:38,231 --> 00:48:42,520
professions and encouraging women to,
um,

949
00:48:42,540 --> 00:48:47,540
you know,
to make whatever kind of contribution 

950
00:48:47,540 --> 00:48:47,540
they could make to,
to,

951
00:48:47,540 --> 00:48:47,540
uh,
to our culture.

952
00:48:47,540 --> 00:48:48,040
Anyway.
So,

953
00:48:48,070 --> 00:48:53,070
so yeah,
there's a lot of things to talk about 

954
00:48:53,070 --> 00:48:53,070
that for sure.
But,

955
00:48:53,070 --> 00:48:55,300
so basically what I would say though is 
that women,

956
00:48:55,301 --> 00:49:00,301
while at the same lot,
while being encouraged while feeling 

957
00:49:00,301 --> 00:49:04,261
that they are an awful lot of positive 
attention and energy are focused on them

958
00:49:04,660 --> 00:49:07,220
at the same time,
they've always been fed this,

959
00:49:07,250 --> 00:49:09,840
this revenge narrative,
you know,

960
00:49:09,850 --> 00:49:14,850
that somehow the past,
it was all terrible for hundreds and 

961
00:49:14,850 --> 00:49:14,850
hundreds of years.

962
00:49:14,850 --> 00:49:16,810
They've been abused.
And so,

963
00:49:16,990 --> 00:49:21,990
um,
so we're getting to the point now we're 

964
00:49:21,990 --> 00:49:24,541
having been fed that and I really do 
think it is an outright lie.

965
00:49:25,510 --> 00:49:29,380
And the problem is to now that all of 
history has been sort of rewritten.

966
00:49:29,381 --> 00:49:34,381
And so it's actually very difficult to 
find out the reality of history because 

967
00:49:34,420 --> 00:49:39,420
we have it filtered through our popular 
culture and things we think we know 

968
00:49:39,420 --> 00:49:39,760
about.
For instance,

969
00:49:39,761 --> 00:49:44,761
women winning the right to vote and the 
fact that there were a whole bunch of 

970
00:49:44,761 --> 00:49:48,271
men,
certainly in Canada and great britain 

971
00:49:48,271 --> 00:49:50,551
who couldn't vote at the same time the 
women were campaigning for the right to 

972
00:49:50,551 --> 00:49:52,090
vote.
Almost nobody knows that at all,

973
00:49:52,240 --> 00:49:55,090
which men couldn't vote,
or those poor men.

974
00:49:55,150 --> 00:49:56,170
Um,
there were,

975
00:49:56,200 --> 00:49:59,370
there were property and um,
um,

976
00:49:59,590 --> 00:50:03,280
wage qualifications at the time.
So,

977
00:50:03,281 --> 00:50:04,270
um,
yeah,

978
00:50:04,271 --> 00:50:05,950
there were,
there were certain restrictions.

979
00:50:05,950 --> 00:50:08,320
Many of the men who went and fought in 
the first world war,

980
00:50:08,321 --> 00:50:09,460
for instance,
the young men,

981
00:50:09,520 --> 00:50:11,790
they couldn't vote either.
So,

982
00:50:11,980 --> 00:50:14,890
so,
but we have this idea that for centuries

983
00:50:15,100 --> 00:50:18,170
men could vote and basically ran society
and,

984
00:50:18,171 --> 00:50:19,690
and women couldn't.
But in fact,

985
00:50:19,691 --> 00:50:22,990
that's not true.
It's just a very narrow window when most

986
00:50:22,991 --> 00:50:26,170
men could vote and when women couldn't.
But anyway,

987
00:50:26,360 --> 00:50:26,870
uh,
and,

988
00:50:26,871 --> 00:50:31,871
and all sorts of other ways,
we have these ideas that women were the 

989
00:50:31,871 --> 00:50:33,890
property of their fathers or their 
husbands and that they were abused,

990
00:50:34,130 --> 00:50:37,100
that nobody believed them,
that nobody cared if they were raped.

991
00:50:37,101 --> 00:50:42,101
That's,
that's the thing that's coming out now 

992
00:50:42,101 --> 00:50:44,350
is I've heard a number of high profile 
female commentators say in just up until

993
00:50:46,311 --> 00:50:51,311
the recent past,
nobody believed a woman if she said 

994
00:50:51,311 --> 00:50:52,910
she'd been raped,
so now we're going to believe them.

995
00:50:53,330 --> 00:50:55,160
Now,
even if that were true,

996
00:50:55,370 --> 00:51:00,370
it wouldn't make sense and it wouldn't 
be just obviously to suddenly now just 

997
00:51:00,370 --> 00:51:04,390
believe every time a woman says that a 
man has done something to her and we 

998
00:51:04,390 --> 00:51:05,900
we're going to destroy that man's career
or we're going to put them in jail.

999
00:51:06,140 --> 00:51:08,140
Was that the most pervasive part of this
though,

1000
00:51:08,141 --> 00:51:13,141
that there's a growing feeling amongst 
this crew that in order to make an 

1001
00:51:13,141 --> 00:51:17,491
omelet,
you're going to have to break certain 

1002
00:51:17,491 --> 00:51:17,491
thing so that you're going to have.
Because they're quite literally.

1003
00:51:17,491 --> 00:51:19,540
I mean,
I see this again from that class of blue

1004
00:51:19,541 --> 00:51:24,100
check twitter feminists or whatever,
or reporters or whatever they are.

1005
00:51:24,480 --> 00:51:26,380
Yeah.
It's okay if a couple of innocent people

1006
00:51:26,390 --> 00:51:26,670
getting.

1007
00:51:26,740 --> 00:51:29,030
No,
I've seen that over and over again.

1008
00:51:29,031 --> 00:51:29,990
Yeah,
it may be.

1009
00:51:29,991 --> 00:51:34,991
It is perfectly okay because of the 
centuries and centuries of abuse and 

1010
00:51:34,991 --> 00:51:39,821
yeah,
that's a crazy idea of retributive 

1011
00:51:39,821 --> 00:51:42,110
justice.
I'm punishing people as a class,

1012
00:51:42,470 --> 00:51:44,900
um,
but I think a lot of people,

1013
00:51:45,020 --> 00:51:50,020
a lot of while both women and men who,
who by that narrative are so whipped up,

1014
00:51:50,850 --> 00:51:51,710
uh,
in,

1015
00:51:51,720 --> 00:51:56,720
in outrage over women's supposedly 
suffering over the centuries that 

1016
00:51:57,160 --> 00:51:59,120
they're quite willing to see some men 
suffer.

1017
00:51:59,121 --> 00:52:00,090
Now.
I mean,

1018
00:52:00,140 --> 00:52:05,140
I read an article,
maybe you saw it too saying that 

1019
00:52:05,140 --> 00:52:05,140
cavenaugh should not be,
uh,

1020
00:52:05,140 --> 00:52:07,880
the denomination should be withdrawn 
because,

1021
00:52:08,180 --> 00:52:11,450
um,
although maybe we shouldn't put men into

1022
00:52:11,540 --> 00:52:16,540
prison just based on a woman's 
unsubstantiated and story from 36 years 

1023
00:52:16,761 --> 00:52:17,870
ago.
But hey,

1024
00:52:17,871 --> 00:52:18,590
come on,
you know,

1025
00:52:18,620 --> 00:52:19,910
supreme court,
well,

1026
00:52:20,060 --> 00:52:21,850
all but five men in the,
you know,

1027
00:52:22,020 --> 00:52:23,810
in the country,
don't get to do that.

1028
00:52:23,810 --> 00:52:25,460
so big deal,
you know,

1029
00:52:25,640 --> 00:52:30,640
it's not.
And then that's certainly been the 

1030
00:52:30,640 --> 00:52:30,640
attitude about the,
the um,

1031
00:52:30,640 --> 00:52:33,650
the tribunals that have been put in 
place in american universities to,

1032
00:52:33,890 --> 00:52:34,700
you know,
people would say,

1033
00:52:34,910 --> 00:52:36,340
well,
there's no like there,

1034
00:52:36,341 --> 00:52:41,341
there are no standards of justice here.
There's no opportunity to cross examine 

1035
00:52:41,961 --> 00:52:44,330
witnesses.
You're not allowed to have a lawyer.

1036
00:52:44,331 --> 00:52:49,331
Sometimes the men weren't even allowed 
to know what the charges against them 

1037
00:52:49,331 --> 00:52:49,340
were and they'd always come out and say,
well,

1038
00:52:49,341 --> 00:52:51,770
but they're not going to be put in 
prison.

1039
00:52:51,771 --> 00:52:55,640
They're just going to be expelled from 
universities as a pretty minor.

1040
00:52:56,630 --> 00:52:57,010
Right.
Well,

1041
00:52:57,011 --> 00:53:02,011
that's why I think this topic is so 
interesting because I'm not 

1042
00:53:02,011 --> 00:53:02,620
particularly.
I don't particularly care about feminism

1043
00:53:02,621 --> 00:53:03,990
or any of these isms.
One word there.

1044
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:06,210
I want everyone to be treated equally,
or at least I want.

1045
00:53:06,400 --> 00:53:09,820
I want the laws of the nation to treat 
everyone equally and then it's on you to

1046
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:15,000
figure out the rest and sometimes there 
are bad people and you have to go out 

1047
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:15,000
and do it yourself and figure it out.
Okay,

1048
00:53:15,220 --> 00:53:18,430
but what now I see happening and now I 
see why this,

1049
00:53:18,850 --> 00:53:23,850
this sort of crazed feminism piece is so
directly related to free speech or the 

1050
00:53:24,701 --> 00:53:28,710
issues I really care about is the way 
that we're.

1051
00:53:28,760 --> 00:53:32,370
This is connected to due process.
Now this is connected to.

1052
00:53:32,371 --> 00:53:37,371
Yeah,
we're gonna break a couple of eggs and 

1053
00:53:37,371 --> 00:53:37,371
we're actually going,
we're going to probably jail people.

1054
00:53:37,371 --> 00:53:41,760
We're going to probably get people fired
and all of these things that you've put 

1055
00:53:41,760 --> 00:53:41,760
out there.
So I do see these,

1056
00:53:41,970 --> 00:53:45,720
these ties to much greater issues and 
this in a weird way,

1057
00:53:45,721 --> 00:53:48,030
this is why a lot of people,
I think peter goes into,

1058
00:53:48,031 --> 00:53:53,031
I've had on this show,
has talked about how the gender studies 

1059
00:53:53,031 --> 00:53:55,830
really is ground zero for this entire 
movement.

1060
00:53:56,730 --> 00:53:57,560
Yeah,
yeah,

1061
00:53:57,590 --> 00:53:59,120
absolutely.
And I've seen this.

1062
00:53:59,121 --> 00:54:03,500
I mean this has been going on in Canada 
for a number of years and it does.

1063
00:54:03,501 --> 00:54:05,750
And gender studies is the ground zero I 
think.

1064
00:54:05,751 --> 00:54:07,430
and part of it is this,
this,

1065
00:54:07,520 --> 00:54:08,870
uh,
this idEa that the,

1066
00:54:09,210 --> 00:54:11,900
you know,
things like the presumption of innocence

1067
00:54:12,170 --> 00:54:15,680
that those really are structures 
designed,

1068
00:54:15,770 --> 00:54:17,090
especially in the cases of,
you know,

1069
00:54:17,210 --> 00:54:22,210
sexual assault law,
that that's designed to protect bad men.

1070
00:54:22,970 --> 00:54:23,950
And therefore,
and I've,

1071
00:54:23,960 --> 00:54:28,580
so I've read all sorts of articles by,
by law students saying,

1072
00:54:28,610 --> 00:54:32,210
okay,
we know what we know,

1073
00:54:32,211 --> 00:54:36,590
what rape trials look like when 
presumption of innocence is the,

1074
00:54:36,770 --> 00:54:41,770
is the default or is the standard,
what would they look like if we started 

1075
00:54:41,811 --> 00:54:46,220
by believing and,
and that whole notion of believing women

1076
00:54:46,221 --> 00:54:49,190
as the,
as the fundamental legal standard.

1077
00:54:49,710 --> 00:54:50,960
It's terrifying.

1078
00:54:51,890 --> 00:54:56,890
What do you think are the best steps to,
to help people that are waking up?

1079
00:54:58,851 --> 00:55:00,700
So you talked about how the,
the,

1080
00:55:00,760 --> 00:55:05,760
you know,
you get all these emails from men and 

1081
00:55:05,760 --> 00:55:05,760
you can hopefully listen to them and 
that sort of thing.

1082
00:55:05,760 --> 00:55:07,730
But if they're there because they're out
there,

1083
00:55:07,731 --> 00:55:09,050
they're watching this right now.

1084
00:55:09,550 --> 00:55:11,100
Well,
I'm not hopeful.

1085
00:55:11,220 --> 00:55:11,940
I mean,
I don't know.

1086
00:55:11,941 --> 00:55:13,890
I don't have the answers.
I really don't.

1087
00:55:13,891 --> 00:55:17,070
I think that we're,
we're really in a mess right now.

1088
00:55:17,570 --> 00:55:18,800
Um,
if,

1089
00:55:18,840 --> 00:55:22,680
if I wanted to say something really 
inflammatory,

1090
00:55:22,681 --> 00:55:27,681
I,
what I would say is that when I was a 

1091
00:55:27,681 --> 00:55:29,781
phd student,
I used to read newspapers from the 18 

1092
00:55:29,781 --> 00:55:30,660
seventies,
eighties,

1093
00:55:30,670 --> 00:55:31,360
seventies,
and eighties,

1094
00:55:31,380 --> 00:55:33,570
nineties because that was my period that
I was working in.

1095
00:55:33,750 --> 00:55:38,750
And I wanted to see what kinds of 
conversations were going on and I did a 

1096
00:55:38,750 --> 00:55:41,210
feminist phd,
I was interested in,

1097
00:55:41,211 --> 00:55:44,610
in female journalists of the 18 eighties
and nineties.

1098
00:55:44,611 --> 00:55:49,611
And there is no,
there Were all sorts of debates about 

1099
00:55:49,611 --> 00:55:50,220
gender relations as we would call it now
going on then.

1100
00:55:50,400 --> 00:55:54,450
And one of them was a question of 
women's political role,

1101
00:55:54,451 --> 00:55:55,020
how,
you know,

1102
00:55:55,140 --> 00:55:57,660
to what extent should women be 
politically involved.

1103
00:55:57,660 --> 00:56:00,780
And really the late 19th century was a 
time when,

1104
00:56:01,350 --> 00:56:03,920
because of advances in,
in,

1105
00:56:03,921 --> 00:56:08,010
um,
a domestic equipment and because of some

1106
00:56:08,011 --> 00:56:13,011
rudimentary birth control measures,
when more women were able to make a 

1107
00:56:13,171 --> 00:56:18,171
contribution at the public level in a 
way they'd never really been able to 

1108
00:56:18,171 --> 00:56:19,090
unless I had been single.
Um,

1109
00:56:19,320 --> 00:56:20,130
but,
um,

1110
00:56:20,220 --> 00:56:25,220
so there were all these debates and know
most men were pretty enthusiastic about 

1111
00:56:25,721 --> 00:56:28,630
the idea of women becoming more publicly
involved.

1112
00:56:28,631 --> 00:56:30,580
And there was very much a sense that 
women would.

1113
00:56:30,970 --> 00:56:35,970
Women brought a certain kind of morality
that women were superior morally than 

1114
00:56:36,851 --> 00:56:38,110
men.
And we still see that now.

1115
00:56:38,111 --> 00:56:41,180
I think the whole idea that women don't 
lie about things,

1116
00:56:41,181 --> 00:56:42,650
you know,
about rape or,

1117
00:56:42,651 --> 00:56:45,010
and various other things that women can 
end war.

1118
00:56:45,220 --> 00:56:47,650
Women can negotiate better than men.
All that,

1119
00:56:47,651 --> 00:56:49,990
you know,
that all ties in.

1120
00:56:50,860 --> 00:56:52,030
Yeah,
well that's true.

1121
00:56:52,030 --> 00:56:57,030
But you know,
it's still the idea that women have 

1122
00:56:57,030 --> 00:56:57,970
something in them that uh,
you know,

1123
00:56:58,020 --> 00:57:03,020
is,
is perhaps morally superior or gives 

1124
00:57:03,020 --> 00:57:03,730
them a certain qualities that men don't 
have still there.

1125
00:57:03,970 --> 00:57:05,980
So it was very much that.
And um,

1126
00:57:06,010 --> 00:57:07,150
but the,
the,

1127
00:57:07,210 --> 00:57:10,580
the anti feminist position at the time 
said it.

1128
00:57:10,920 --> 00:57:13,870
It's dangerous.
Women are too emotional.

1129
00:57:14,200 --> 00:57:18,360
Women are less rational than men.
Women can take pr,

1130
00:57:18,430 --> 00:57:23,430
they personalize everything so they're 
not able to sort of separate themselves 

1131
00:57:23,430 --> 00:57:23,890
and uh,
you know,

1132
00:57:23,891 --> 00:57:28,891
make decisions that in an objective,
unbiased manner and you have that kind 

1133
00:57:30,101 --> 00:57:31,710
of thing and you know,
they,

1134
00:57:31,740 --> 00:57:36,740
they,
this was related to women's biology and 

1135
00:57:36,740 --> 00:57:36,940
various things.
And I remember I used to laugh and think

1136
00:57:36,941 --> 00:57:40,630
how ridiculous that was.
And yet I have to say that over the last

1137
00:57:40,631 --> 00:57:45,631
10 years as I have seen,
I mean because me to which claims it's 

1138
00:57:45,631 --> 00:57:45,790
this new conversation.

1139
00:57:45,790 --> 00:57:50,790
It isn't really new,
I mean this has been going on at least 

1140
00:57:50,790 --> 00:57:51,810
since anita hill and clarence thomas and
you know,

1141
00:57:51,850 --> 00:57:56,850
certainly throughout the 19 nineties 
following anita hill's charges against 

1142
00:57:56,850 --> 00:58:01,771
thomas.
There was a lot of discussion about 

1143
00:58:01,771 --> 00:58:01,900
sexual harassment in the workplace and 
what we're going to do about it.

1144
00:58:02,110 --> 00:58:05,710
A lot of legislation brought in a lot of
innocent men,

1145
00:58:05,711 --> 00:58:10,711
you know,
disciplined or fired from their jobs as 

1146
00:58:10,711 --> 00:58:13,051
a result of various claims women made 
that they'd been made to feel 

1147
00:58:13,051 --> 00:58:13,750
uncomfortable or you know,
whatever it happened to be.

1148
00:58:13,751 --> 00:58:16,720
And so This has been going on for a long
time.

1149
00:58:16,721 --> 00:58:21,721
I think.
And I have to say that it makes me 

1150
00:58:21,721 --> 00:58:24,211
wonder sometimes whether those 
antifeminist from the late 19th century 

1151
00:58:24,211 --> 00:58:28,620
were right.
That what is it about this mass movement

1152
00:58:31,510 --> 00:58:36,510
so angry,
this movement of vengeance that is 

1153
00:58:36,510 --> 00:58:40,861
starting to make these completely 
irrational claims about how we should 

1154
00:58:41,321 --> 00:58:43,540
proceed,
who we should believe,

1155
00:58:43,630 --> 00:58:48,630
why,
why it doesn't matter that we suspend 

1156
00:58:48,630 --> 00:58:50,260
basic principles of presumption of 
innocence and due process.

1157
00:58:50,500 --> 00:58:55,500
How can it be?
This is actually being taken seriously 

1158
00:58:55,500 --> 00:58:57,340
in our public culture.
And I mean,

1159
00:58:57,341 --> 00:59:02,341
I don't know,
but I do have to wonder whether the 

1160
00:59:02,341 --> 00:59:05,101
presence of women isn't having some kind
of really deleterious effect on our 

1161
00:59:06,311 --> 00:59:10,990
public conversations about these things.
That was only if you wanted to end on an

1162
00:59:10,991 --> 00:59:12,070
inflammatory.
Yeah.

1163
00:59:14,310 --> 00:59:15,920
I really thoroughly enjoyed this.
I mean,

1164
00:59:15,921 --> 00:59:20,921
it's,
it's such an interesting topic because 

1165
00:59:20,921 --> 00:59:20,921
it hits on so many of the things that I,
that I care about.

1166
00:59:20,921 --> 00:59:22,580
I suspect we will do this again.
Thank You very much.

1167
